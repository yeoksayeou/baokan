<p>（重慶）此間華人對於東京方面傳來關於英日談判之消息多抱悲觀、因此等消息、似皆表示英日雙方有趨於妥協之傾向、此後英國對於中日戰爭之態度或將有重要變化也、中國之官方在未獲較爲具體較爲詳確之報告前、不願有所表示、截至昨日爲止、多數官員皆認英國決不止於十分讓步、必能將談判僅限於天津之局部問題、而不至於採取間接損害中國抗戰之行動、但據美聯社記者訪問此間華方當道之結果、彼等對於英國目前東西不能兼顧之困境、雖多認爲事實、但彼等皆謂英國假若與日本妥協、則英國在中國與遠東之利益、勢將消滅、而造成後悔無及之莫大錯誤、至於財政界方面、認目前之英日談判、無論如何發展、皆不必過爲杞人之憂、一則中國在海外尚存有雄厚之外滙準備金、同時美國方面之新借欵、不久亦有成立之可能、因該項借欵目前正在華盛噸進行談判中也、三則中蘇貿易協定之成立、對華之幫助亦不小、四則中國仍在積極增加輸出、縮減輸入之努力中、故英國之幫助、中國雖歡迎、但即使英國不幫助、亦無問題、蓋中國本不單靠英國之幫助也、據中立外人方面觀察、英日假定完全趨於妥協、雖能影響中國之金融、但決不致影響中國之繼續抗戰、同時英日妥協之後、中國或將更其傾向蘇聯與美國、而於此二國中、中國之傾向於蘇聯無論在疆土距離上利害關係上、皆較美國對華更爲關切也（二十三日美聯電）</p>
<p>（重慶）今晨此間華不報對於所傳昨日東京英日談判中已商妥之協定、均未見有任河詳細之紀事載、僅謂「談判正在進行」及「英國將不致犧牲其友人而助日本」云云、目下此間官方對於東京英日談話、尚未作何批評、眾信中國當局現正靜候倫敦方面之官方文告、中國當局在明日倫敦東京發表關於津案之文告前、不欲有所論列、蓋須俟見兩地文告後、始能確知東京談話之眞相、於是將決定其意見、倫敦官方現對東京談話之結果、緘默不發一言、據稱迄今所發表之消息、皆自東京傳出、華人各界不欲遽認此項消息為確實可靠也、（二十三日路透電）</p>

<h3 id="c7">英國對日讓步 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>東京談判之中，英國對日本讓步，雖在英國當局，亦所不復能諱飾；　所不可遽知者，讓步之程度何似耳。就所不可知，正不妨先作種種不同程度之假定，分別推論；然揭曉即在旦夕，與其多所假定，甯若稍緩須臾，靜觀事實；事實所示，非任何人，任何「花言巧語」所得而掩蔽天下耳目。例如英倫某報昨爲彼外交醜態洗刷曰：中立乃屬適符國策，此其自欺良知，欺人欺世，而三尺孩童亦不爲所欺，欺何益耶！</p>
<p>英國之國際政策，夙爲世人不予信任；故在近年風狂雨暴之中，世論之鼓勵英國者爲多，而依恃英國者極少。證以最近英國嘗佯示慷慨，欲予北歐西歐諸國以保障，諸國期期以爲不可；此無他，英國之保障不足恃，徒以結怨德意志而賈禍耳；是則無待變節東京而灼然可覩者也。</p>
<p>就大體論之：英國竟至於對日讓步，有其軍事上經濟上之近利，更有其傳統之民族性之遠因，此讓步之內在緣由也；復以蘇聯對於三國協定之抝執，美國中立法問題對於總統羅斯福氏政治威信權能之測騐結果，以及德國對但澤自由市問題之鍥而不舍，此讓步之國際緣由也。此項國際緣由，殆必爲張伯倫對外屈膝，而對內欺罔上下，留戀政權之藉口。同時雖予美國孤立派與蘇俄當局以藉口曰，張伯倫不足與有爲，斯遠之不足恤，亦殆爲張伯倫所不恤。至於德國，將不以英日妥協而對英有所顧忌，必且以證明英國之卑怯而氣燄愈昂。於是推論，英國對日讓步之影響，不限於遠東一隅，所關固極廣泛。事非意外，東京談判之過去未來要不過慕尼黑會議之複習而已；而英外相哈里法克斯再三聲明英國外交政策不受默書式之命令云云者，在張伯倫必以爲誓不奉命默書，僅爲自甘背誦而已；再三表示不更能忍受恥辱云云者，今後果得日本之溫情撫慰，更不復以封鎖加之矣。</p>
<p>如此云云，非以鄙視英國；抑鄙視與尊重，殆無所損益於英國。然就事論之，讓步非定局，問題正多。蓋英國讓步之程度不可知，但僅僅以所謂租界中立之一端而論，租界之本質與中立之意義，有非英國所得而獨斷者；今乃英國使之變質，試問國際聯盟非有會員國不得削弱中國抗戰力量，並應盡量援華之決議乎，英國將何以自解於國聯曁各會員國？此其一·九國公約曾爲英國所支持，英國且曾據約對日抗議，英國將何以遮飾今茲之讓步？此其二。事關中國國民政府統治權之下者，英國慷慨移轉之，更張之，於法理爲有效乎？此其三，事關英日以外之他國者，他國甘爲張伯倫殉乎？此其四。此四者，莫隘狹視之爲對於英國對日讓步之反對論，乃爲主持讓步之張伯倫所亦應爲覓答案者也。</p>
<p>英國政策，英人主之，至少亦爲張伯倫主之；局外反對，殆爲徒勞；局外鼓勵英國者旣眾，未有絲毫效騐，茲更警告，亦復無裨；不甯惟是，緣是而有人情所不能禁之反應，不問如何超國界而普遍深入，然不能自制其極端憤慨者，亦僅止於極端煩悶，憤慨與煩悶又奚益於國際大局；或不若是而效法「紳士」風度，依然休休有容，依然以有餘不盡之思，而善頌善禱曰，英國必不負人，英國殆不負我，是爲英國所正中下懷，但亦何望於英國之幡然改圖；因此種種，雖英國之態度如彼，我人猶冀各方遏制行將奔放之感情，而保持沉着之理智。根據我人理智之一得，最爲英國今日之態度惋惜者：遠東局勢，將因此愈趨混沌，愈趨複雜；英國夙昔隱然爲安定遠東之重要因素，自此自喪其爲重要因素之地位。誠以安定遠東者：（一）中國自信爲繫於中國之抗戰建國，（二）日本自信爲繫於日本之戰勝而締造所謂新秩序，（三）國際形形色色之由兢爭而消長而決定。自信者，皆百分之百，初無所謂國際羼入其間；然戰爭閱兩年，雙方實力皆多消耗，要爲最客觀之確論；是不問消耗之質量如何，消耗後之支持力如何，然國際關係之更深見重於雙方，且滲透雙方國族之嚴防而見重於雙方之和戰歧途，此又最客觀之觀察也。英國固國際之重鎭，有其大有可爲之地位者也，而今之退嬰，何殊自棄。茲於英國之變態，國民政府之反響如何，猶無所聞；然國民政府所得力於英國者實以抗戰初期爲甚，及港粵之交通綫旣經切斷，軍事運輸之脈絡別有所在，而民族之重心復西遷，一般國民生活與外滙之關係亦愈遠愈疎，是以抗戰初期之後，愈至近頃，而國民政府在事實上獲助於英國者愈少，况一年來英國尤暴露其援華之吝嗇；因此之故，謂國民政府將以英國變態而減損其自信，乃爲任何人所不作如是觀。至於在日本，英國旣讓步，彼軍部之主張，是又經彼溫和派之手，而對英國獲得進一步之成功；自此而後，英國所愛重之日本溫和派，愈低降而爲軍部之外交的技術人員，亦即溫和派之主張爲英國所犧牲而更爲軍部所不屑一顧；此則自時機與策略言之，實予雙方之和戰歧途以「微妙」之惡劣影響，而使日本軍部欣然於其所自信。中日雙方之自信，爲戰爭乃至延長戰爭之基礎；而英國之退嬰則在英國爲自減其爲安定遠東之重要性，而使國際形形色色之成分漸變其質量，誘致其消長之新動嚮。促進此新動嚮者，中英感情之轉變乃其重要之心理基礎也。</p>

<p>據滬西莘莊來滬鄕人談、滬杭錢莘莊鎭北首的五公里之會石橋地方、於越昨（二十一日）發生激烈之遊擊戰、該處鄕間原駐有徐新洲之殘部、自新任松江縣長謝一民蒞任後、對於零星小股遊擊隊，逐漸</p>
<p>收編訓練故倉石橋於前數日開到謝部之一大隊、將附近雜牌隊伍收編竣事、方期入手訓練之際、突被日方間牒偵悉、向日軍部吿密、謂謝部實力漸見濃厚、應速設法剿除、而</p>
<p>謝部精銳則在倉石橋等語、日軍部聞訊、立即抽調警備滬杭路之守衛日軍的三百人左右、携有輕重機槍十餘挺、由松江及梅隴鎭兩處出發、向倉石橋地方推進、而謝部亦已得悉日軍</p>
<p>又來圍攻乃即預爲佈置、在二十一日淸晨天曉時、日軍已抵達目的地、霎時密集之槍聲陡起、雙方激戰甚烈、日軍雖有備而來、然突遇堅强之抵抗、殊無進展把握、詛謝部又以熟諳地理、加派</p>
<p>有力部隊向日軍四面包抄、日軍因四野槍聲、逐漸逼近、恐陷入重圍、不敢戀戰、遂漸引退、此役日軍遺落機槍一挺、步槍十餘枝、謝部則有隊士十餘人受傷、惟日軍於上午九時餘退去時、曾防火焚去農村中民房十餘宅、以示洩憤</p>

<p>自銀錢業實施匯劃制度後、因制度良好，各業受益匪淺，今、爲防止投機囤積操縱、各行莊　實行緊縮貨物押款，茲志詳情如下、</p>
<p>同業匯劃　頗收宏效</p>
<p>銀行聯合準備委員會、於七月四日起辦理領用同業匯劃後、各行莊均已陸續提供擔保品、向該會領用同業匯劃、該會之評價委員會隨時審査評定價格、並依照評價額百分之七十辦理、是項擔保品、均歸中外銀行界合組之保管委員會保管之、此外並由市商會等團體合組準備檢查委員會、實行檢查各行花領用匯劃準備、行將召開首决委員會、公開檢査、至於匯劃制度推行收效後、滬市工商各業、均受益匪淺、</p>
<p>防止投機限制押款</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀錢業探悉、銀錢兩業公會、鑒於自財政部馬電公佈後、該兩業爲安定市面計、將同業存會庫之二千二百萬兀匯劃存款、得中中交三行同意、按九五折成法幣、分十二期掉換、以備同業支付五百元以下之法幣存款、而另定提供擔保品領用同業匯劃辦法、爲調劑同業支付五百元以上匯畫之用、現聞同業有寬鬆匯劃承做貨物押款、使一般囤積貨物、物價高漲、有助長投機之概、故特通吿各會員行莊對貨物押款、應加緊縮、</p>
<p>法幣運滬　調劑市面</p>
<p>上海最近因投機事業之勃興、造成黑市外滙之暴縮、及黃金價格之飛漲、於是向各行莊提取現鈔者增加、各行莊已得中中交三行之同意、自七月四日起、將存會庫之而個二百萬元匯劃籌碼、分十二個星期掉給法幣籌碼、因此各行莊均能應付目前環境、使整個金融保持常態、自華北各地名鈔票爲防止套買外滙、不得不酌予限制收兌後、因市場法幣籌碼驟吿缺乏、聞中中交農四行爲安定市面、已有大批法幣籌碼運抵上海、</p>

<p>上海豆米市塲國米價格漲至限價後、市塲交易混亂、頂特頭號米絕跡、管理委員會向行號勸吿、租界當局嚴格執行限價、洋米七百噸抵滬後已開始出售、整個民食可無缺乏慮、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>管委勸告　執行限價</p>
<p>市外匯緊縮、以及靑黃不接之際、來源稀少、於是囤戶不允在限價以下出售、造成頂特頭號各米絕跡、中决各米竟漲至限盤、實與租界當局之限價原則、即中决各米一律遞减不符、所以市塲管理委員會各委員、已分別向市塲一百零五家行號勸吿、切勿超越租界當局之限價、同時租界當局嚴格執行限價、並望隨時檢舉、以憑取締、</p>
<p>洋米期近　民食無慮</p>
<p>雜糧商人前委託達孚洋行、向西貢訂購之洋米、的七百噸計七千包、每包爲一百九十八斤、合一石二斗半、自運抵後、業已卸下、暫存堆棧內、計分西貢一號及二號兩種、業已開始發售、價格一號每包爲二十二元、業已成交數百包、惟二號米價格尙未做出、而雜糧商人之成本、聞一號米爲二十元零五角、如以二十二元出售、尙有厚利可獲、惟因黑市外匯緊縮、暫時已無續訂者、</p>
<p>新米期近　民食無慮</p>
<p>滬市租界內之存米、雖據調查、已逐漸減少、僅三十萬餘包、但市民預購者、尙不在內、至於來源之稀少、此係靑黃不接之時、應有之現象、幸產地運滬之米、並未完全斷絕、况江浙皖三省之早稻、行將登塲、所以滬市民食、依米商之觀察、可無缺乏慮、如此後無颶風之襲擊、則各地晚稻均可豐收、此决呂宋島之颶風浙皖兩省早稻受到相常損失、幸並不十分嚴重</p>
<p>米價高漲　暗盤繼起</p>
<p>現因各產地來源較暢、同時氣候炎暑、存棧各米均相繼脫售、米價亦因現貨市塲充沛、一律回跌、原本最高價已回至廿元關、當局曁米業團體、爲適應事實、特將米價厭低、詎外匯緊縮波動、一般投機囤戶、竟然乘機崛起、大量扒吸、而早已盤踞在非同業手中之米糧、緣此居奇囤積、待善價而沽、形成買方多而賣方少、供求不應、故滬市數日來米價又復繼漲增高、早經當局取締、在交易上不應有之暗盤、死灰復燃、經大光社記者多方探詢、頭號米之暗盤米價。已超越二十一元以上、中號米亦已越出限價惟圃戶方面拗揑作態、居奇待售、但交易雙方並無書面載明、故取締暗盤一事、異常困難、</p>
<p>將取締業　外人交易</p>
<p>據大光社記者探悉、米業市塲迭决發生米價高漲風潮、其主要原因、爲滬地所存米糧、已由同業轉輾售入非同業手中、彼輩藉資金雄厚、一切可左右裕如、但米糧一經被非同業攫取團積後、即成死貨、非至高傻時不賣、一面又再大量扒進、現米業各團體、爲澄本淸源計、正在縝密研究取締、同業不准與業外人巨額交易、防止擾亂行市、如將來此項辦法、能獲有根本解决後、米市交易之穩定、可一勞永逸、</p>

<p>大陸報云、南昌美敎士霍倫之下落、與所傳被日方扣留事、突然無聞者、幾已六星期矣、據日軍連絡官某中佐昨（二十二日）在招待新聞記者席上聲稱、該敎士現居南昌醫院、且常居其中、「某美國通訊社」所傳霍倫被扣、下落不明一說、發自漢口者、乃若干方面故意擬使美日發生爭執、南昌與漢口日駐軍司令部已正式</p>
<p>加以否認再、南昌日軍參謀官之現抵漢口者、對此說頗爲驚奇、因霍倫現正與日軍維持友好接觸、南昌日軍指揮官常與霍倫互邀同餐、整個問題乃因在南昌靑年會發現大量反日傳單與其他印刷品而起、該靑年會乃霍倫監督之南昌醫院所管理、故</p>
<p>抄出傳單雜誌等責負責人乃霍倫、漢口美代理總領事傑維斯旋要求赴南昌之便利、俾調查發現反日印刷物事、日方未予准許、因南昌甚近前綫、且此乃地方性質之問題、應由南昌日軍當局與靑年會有關人員解决之、</p>
<p>霍倫被扣之說、乃根據傑維斯所稱霍倫未覆其信、而在漢口發出者、此說「全屬無稽」、同時霍倫已致函傑維斯、吾認渠被扣之說、或詢此覆函何日寄出、漢口美領事何日接獲、該速絡官答已</p>
<p>忘其日期、又稱渠本人、（明日二十三日）將與上海美總領事高斯晤談霍倫案之詳情、談話結論、將公佈之、又傳其他美僑現被日方扣留之說、「亦屬不確」、或詢日方是吾信霍倫或興傳達情報予華方</p>
<p>游擊隊事有關、據答、並無可信之理由、上海日軍接訊、悉霍倫乃負時譽之人、常居醫院、現亦居其中、南昌因常有游擊隊突入、且迫近前綫、故情况仍不安定、而對第三國僑民實行宵禁、惟八月間宵禁</p>
<p>可望取消云、本埠美總領署某員昨向記者證實漢口美領署已接霍倫所發之函、該員雖拒不披露該函內容、惟稱此係「重行担保之性質、」美總領事高斯答覆詢問稱、渠對日軍連絡官所稱「渠將與高斯明日舉行會談」事、並無所知云、</p>

<p>因爲現在的廠址較小，所以男女工用午膳時間分開了，我們是在十一時半，他們是正十二時，而上工時問，我們也比他們早半小時。說到吃飯，就想一件特別事情，就是我們一羣裏吃素的人非常多，什麼九皇素，白衣素，朱天素，觀音素雷齋素，以及恕我背不出的那些素，她們擇其善者而從之，甚至於一人兼吃幾種素的。聽說吃了白衣素會保康健，吃了朱天素，可以達到求財得財，求子得子的願望，吃了觀音素，來世可以生就一個美臉兒，吃了雷齋素，可以避瘟疫，……吃素的日期有一，七，十，三，六，九，逢二，逢六，等區別，也有連着幾天素的，也有所謂淡齋的，直快把我的腦子也纏昏了。我到現在才知道吃素這件功德被這姑娘們看得如此其重，她們會侃侃而談着吃素的故事，旁邊也有人證實着靈騐的例子。我吿訴她們除了雷齋素較有意義外—因爲吃素的日期是從廢歷六月初一吃到六月底的，所以在這樣的熱天，吃了素倒也可以於無意中避去許多傳染病，其餘都沒有意思，你們白白的犧牲口福，何苦來呢？正在這時，不吃素的朋友紛紛的丟眼色過來，脚上也得着警吿了，似乎在說：「管她們呢，她們吃素，我們落得多吃些菜呀！」</p>
<p>女工上工的鐘聲一響，工房裏念經也似的讀書聲驟然靜了，接着男工已飯罷，一種淸脆抑揚的京調伴奏着柔和的胡琴聲，順着風，循着樓梯，緩緩地，陣陣的飄進工房裏來。這時候，大家的胸襟都爲之一爽，半日來的辛勞，早已化爲烏有了。</p>
<p>說到她們的念書，不禁使我回憶去年冬天的事了。那時，我覺得她們終日蟄居室中，會損害健康，於是鼓勵她們上平臺上晒太陽去，她們那些較大的姑娘，三三兩兩的挽着臂談天。較小的呢，跳呀跳的，老虎山，捉迷藏，…凡是學校裏一般小天使們想得到的，她們都玩過了，快樂，滿意，從每一個天眞的微笑裏洋溢出來。就在這時候，我發生悲哀憐憫之心，也就在這時候起，我開始盡我些本位上的責任，—帮助她們念書了，程度從「小小貓」的第一冊一直到「一個窮苦的孩子」的高小一年級，從傻瓜阿牛等毫無嗇吝的自己買了書拿到我的面前來，一直到最羞怯的阿英等也顫顫的捧着書挨近我的身旁，最後是每個人手捧一冊了。吿訴朋友們一件消息：現在她們也會在她們的領薪單上畫着她們的名兒了。</p>
<p>如今我們所感到的，就是廠房嫌小些，但是，我們的大廠房已經開始動工了，各種完美的設備裝置，都由我們的經理計劃支配，不到年底，我們準可遷入這所理想的樂園了。每一個工友想到了道事，或者大家談到這事，總是不知不覺的眉飛色舞起來。</p>
<p>我國的工業，向來是趕不上人家的，而對於針一類的工業，在國內更是見所未見，有多少商家知道中國人自己會製針而紛紛的來定貨。我們廠裏每日能產針一百萬，可是常常不够應付，可見大家愛護國貨之忱了。我沒有大資本，更無企業家的才幹，不能有所立業，但是，能够混在新興工業的隊伍裹，當一名搖旗吶喊的小卒，稍稍地盡一些崗位上的　任，也不算沒有價値吧！</p>

<h3 id="c90">今後如何推行滙劃制度 <a href="#c90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— 謝菊曾</p>
<p>七月一日起，上海銀錢業存放交換所及準備庫的滙劃存款約計二千二百萬元，巳經協定按九五扣折合劃頭，分十二星期掉換法幣，同時由聯合準備委員會開始辦理新滙劃領用事宜。一切經過詳情，及各項章則，先後已見報載，大家皆已耳熟能詳，茲不贅述。如今讓我們來討論今後如何推行匯劃制度，以應付財部馬電施行以後的環境。</p>
<p>本來上海的滙劃票據，原是隔日可以收現的。自從前年八一三起，材政部頒布安定金融辦法，規定滙劃票據只限於同業間的收解，於是滙劃票據便成爲一種不兌現的籌碼。一般手中執有匯劃票據，——取只有滙劃存款——而急於需用法幣的，不得不貶値貼現。因此貼現便成爲上海小錢莊的一律公開業務。最初貼現每千不過六七元，後來愈抬愈高，平均盤旋於五十元先右，無形中把匯劃票據對法幣之比率，定下了一個九五扣，也即成爲這决舊匯劃折合劃頭的計算標準。</p>
<p>舊匯劃與新滙劃的區別，就是前者是一種　信用担保的籌碼。後者是一種物質担保的籌碼。至於不能收現和只限於存入行莊，互相轉帳，原是一樣。所以嚴格地說，此乃担保方面的加强與改善而不楚制度上的新舊問題，因爲系統原是一貫的。</p>
<p>我們要知道八一三以後的滙劉制度，就是轉賬制度。說到轉賬制度，數十年來，寗波地方，一向採用，積久成習，轉覺實質貨幣的授受爲累贅，所以寗波有過賬碼頭之稱。而且每年必有一個時期，「過洋」——等於現在上海的滙劃——貴於現洋。在平時如此，即在八一三以後，也是如此。考甫地轉賬制度的發達和普及，固然由於歷史悠久，根蒂深固；此外另有一點，値得注意，就是當地的金融業，用利率來推行轉賬制度。原來寗波錢莊，向來不開洋拆，只開甬拆。如果把現洋存給他們，不給利息，甚或拒絕收受。必須合成過洋，方照市拆每月給予利息。同時他們放賬，也只放過洋，不放現洋。因此凡與他們發生債權債務關係的，皆非使用過洋不可。雖則每逢花米上市，需用現幣赴鄕間辦貨，或因時局關係，現幣需要驟强，以致現升高漲，但此不過一時的現象，且決不影響轉賬制度的普遍使用。所以寗波雖爲最初五口通商大埠之一，它的現幣流通量，——也即是需要量——很是有限的。我們要應付目前上海的環境，限制法幣的流通，和推廣滙劃制度的使用，那末對於寗波的成法，似値得加以考慮。査上海自八一三以來，滙劃存款的月息，統扯總在三元左右；而活期法幣存款利息，則平均在年息四五厘之間。——指主顧存入銀行而言。換句話說，就是法幣存款利率高過於滙劃存款，這也是滙劃與法幣相形覓細的一個原因。自從本年六月份起，滙劃拆息每月常在二角左右，如此今後滙劃存款的月息，當達六元左右。此舉很能獎掖主顧的接受滙劃籌碼，從而孳生利息。吾們更望今後銀錢同業，再作進一步的表示。最好規定一價時期，從那時起，凡是用法幣或劃頭存入或來開立新活期存戶的，一概不給利息，或給以極低的利息。至於從前舊存款及定期存款，不妨照舊辦理。同時活期滙劃存款，則按月照拆息計算利率，照現在情形，就等於年息七厘。如是持有滙劃籌碼的人，旣有確切可靠的保障，又有優厚的利息，自然格外樂於收受了。關於道個辦法，或有人顧慮目下洋商銀行正在拚命吸收法幣存款，與乎外滙套息的利益優厚，恐怕轉形成爲淵驅魚的局面。其實這層此刻已完全不成問題，第一，洋商洋行對於活期法幣存款，本來也是不給利息，雖有一二家收受儲蓄存款，酌給利息，但每戶每月存額均有限制。而且幾家洋商領袖銀行，對於我們向表同情，或可從外交上或同業情感上，與之成立某種協定，請其拒收法幣存款。至於外滙套息一節，目下外灘幾家大銀打，已經有不准掉期的傾向，如楚套利交易漸有消弭的可能。這時我們如果雙管並下，再運用利率政策，來推行滙劃制度，便可事半功倍之。</p>
<p>不但如此，各行莊旣把所有的財產，領得滙劃籌碼，那末今後對於各業資金的融通，也應專以滙劃籌碼為限。此舉在行莊本身說，一副資本，產生二副籌碼，有兩副的運用，其便利自不必說。在各業產塲說，借得款項，旣限於滙劃籌碼，則一切原料的採辦，貨物的批進，自必儘就可能範圍之內，向內地或能够接父匯劃籌碼的行家交易。如此往復循環，滙劃制度的推行，自必逐漸普遍了。</p>
<p>至於　劃證的發行，目下規定最低面額為五百元，鄙意以爲不妨再發行五十元與一百元兩種。（與票據法施行法第十條規定相符）以便流通。若顧慮外界誤會到莫明其妙的流通券上面去，則事實是最佳的答復，不久自然會渙然冰釋的。吾則五百元與五十元，也不過百步與五十步之比罷了。如此持有滙劃票據的人，如爲便於授受，或不願存入行莊起見，儘可掉取由準備會直接保證的滙劃證，轉輾流通。等到大家認識了滙劃證的眞價値，那時滙劃制度不普及也普及了。</p>
<p>還有，根據這决新滙劃領用辦法，每一行莊領用多少，是要貼欠息的，實際等於變相的押款。未免使一向頭寸充裕的行莊，爲之趦趄。雖則舊滙劃已經消滅，不得不被迫領用新滙劃，但它們一定播斤掂兩，只就每日交換差額加以領用，如是籌碼決不會增加到什麽的。我們固然不主張滙劃籌碼的不當鬆濫，但一面對法幣流通旣加以限制，則爲推行滙劃制度起見，滙劃籌碼似乎應從事相當的增加。那末對於領用的欠息與存息間的差別，似應格外略小。同時對於領用滙劃證的，在未經向準備會最後轉賬之前，不應計算欠息，這也未始無補於滙劃制度的推行吧。</p>
<h3 id="c91">建議統制外匯方案 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— 潘傳棟</p>
<p>上海最近金融亂局，皆以外匯爲中心。不統制外匯，無法穩定金融，而不統制貿易，即無法統制外匯，吾人前於論及上海可吾改劃賬碼頭時，即已言之。果未久政府即發布新禁止進口貨品辦法及進出口貨結匯及繳領差額兩辦法，又宣稱政府不供給淪陷區外匯。前日限制華北地名法幣，翌日即限制供給上海外匯，致使外匯縮至四五辨士。筆者爲簡捷計，茲條列各問題及統制外匯之擬議方法如後。此事關係於全上海工商業前途及居民之鉅，非可意度，幸高明敎之。</p>
<p>（一）新政策以前（六·七以前）政府之困難</p>
<p>（一）政府不維持外匯，即無法穩定幣値，　因現法幣爲匯兌本位，同時不維持外匯即喪　失國家財政對外之信用。</p>
<p>（二）欲維持外匯，必須使國際貿易平衡。　即减少進口，增加出口·但淪陷區海關被刧　持，不能實行禁止進口。</p>
<p>（三）欲維持外匯，不能僅靠平衡基金，因　基金有限，而外匯之供給無窮。故必須開源　節流。節流耶限止進口。開源即使出口商人　將外匯售於政府可統制之銀行。但法價高於　暗市價，故外幣價値在暗市高，在政府可統　制銀行，即中交兩行低。因此外匯賣出者願　在暗市賣出。因外幣在暗市可掉之法幣較多　之故。因此政府不易取得外匯，而同時須售　出外匯，有坐吃山空之勢。</p>
<p>（四）外匯之跌落因（甲）奸人殷富之買入，</p>
<p>（乙）交通不便，生產停頓，成本增高，法幣國內購買力低落。（丙）入超，以上三種原因　，均無法完全統制。</p>
<p>（二）新政策（依禁止進口二百三十四種貨物規則及進出口貨物結匯新辦法）下政府之眞意。</p>
<p>（一）增加出口，抑制進口。</p>
<p>（二）將法價實際上改爲七辨士左右。（甲可使內地出口商不致將外匯賣與暗市。因內　地出口商將外匯賣與暗市，必須經過匯款等　費用，現在法價與暗市價相差無幾，則賣與　中交亦無損失，賣與暗市，並無利益。（乙）使與估計之法幣目前購買力相合。</p>
<p>（三）提存限制，並對上海及淪陷區外匯不　予供給。可使（甲）奸人殷富無法買內地出口　貨所掉成之外匯。（乙）不負擔償付淪陷區入　超之責。</p>
<p>（四）如此可以增加外匯來源，减少外匯去　路，穩定法幣對外價値，防止奸人陰謀。</p>
<p>（三）新政策結果</p>
<p>（一）因匯價之新水準，貨物高漲，銷路縮　减，商人正當所需外匯减少。</p>
<p>（二）發生對法幣疑慮，殷富吸收更甚。（造成提存）</p>
<p>（三）好人意在使僞券流行，故以僞券掉法　幣。掉得之法幣，本無用處，故匯價雖低，　仍願吸收。</p>
<p>（四）因以上兩原因，外匯縮至四辨士半。</p>
<p>（五）暗市與新法價又差十分之三。</p>
<p>（六）深恐造成繼續下跌。金融及企業，突然停止。</p>
<p>（四）筆者擬議政府對統制區域之統制辦法</p>
<p>（一）不再貶低新法價。但嗣後內地出口商　必須持有中交結匯憑證，方許出口。如此外匯來源，可以截留。</p>
<p>（二）指定人員，進行上海區外匯自給制度</p>
<p>（三）在上海區新制未穩定前，仍維持六辨士半。</p>
<p>（五）筆者擬議擬議上海金融工商統制辦法</p>
<p>（一）成立外匯淸算所，施行自給自足制度</p>
<p>（二）淸算所由中外進出口商行，中外匯兌　銀行組織之。</p>
<p>（三）凡買入售出外匯者應於相當期聞以前　，向淸算所申請。核准後再行辦理進出口。</p>
<p>（四）淸算所以平衡外匯需給爲目的。其匯　兌率似應固定在辨六士半。以免法幣在內地　及上海有價値之差。</p>
<p>（五）淸算所會員間成立紳士協定，除經淸　算所核准外，不收買外匯。但淸算所以爲外　匯頭寸有餘時，可以出售。</p>
<p>（六）本文結論依照（四）（五）兩條，則政府一方，不致因上海之變動又影響新政策。在上海一方，亦不致因仰給於中交之維持，及受制於奸人之套取，而永久焦灼於外匯變動之中。顧第（五）擬議，能吾實行，深盼我方銀商界領袖考慮。蓋如目前，再聽外匯之放任，恐無論對中外商界其後患均有不堪言者。</p>
<h3 id="c92">西南工業建設的新姿態（上） <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 朱爾嘉</p>
<p>新政策與實施競賽</p>
<p>西南——本文僅指川·黔·滇·三省——工業在抗戰前，四川省稍有　形的基礎外，黔·滇兩省大部尙滯留於農業社會的時代。戰幕揭起後，開發根據地的工業建設，是抗建大業之一，同時因為戰區及臨近戰區之民族工業的陸續內遷，西南工業建設的進展，眞有令人起「地別三日，刮目相看」的感想！</p>
<p>非常的建設，必須施行非常的政策，纔能適應非常的需要，當局對此所採取的政策策，是着重在新工業基礎建設的統制和獎勵。重新建立工業基礎的努力實績，我們在下面將根據事實來加以說明，這裏先就工業統制方面說起。二十六年十二月二十二日，國府首頒「戰時農礦工商管理條例」，將屬於烯料金屬及其製品，酸　及其他合品——水泥酒精，及其他溶劑，橡膠及效果通器具，電器及動力器材，及其他續經指定之重工業品；屬於植物油棉蔴毛絲製品，紙及其製品，印刷敎育之文化品，藥品，糖，釀造品，油漆，火柴，陶瓷，磚瓦及其他續經指定之輕工業品，都劃歸軍事委員會管理。嗣因改革工業行政，集中事權於經濟部後，此項條例，不符實際，在二十七年十月六日，曾經修正，改歸經濟部負責。同時經濟部更分設工業司，資源委員會，工礦調鑿處，和中央工業試騐听四機關，分司工業的分配調整，扶植獎進，技術管理，和考騐改良。與調整，扶植獎進，技術管理，和考騐改良。與調整工業各部門活動的統制政策並行的是獎勵與扶植，對舊有的工業方面，在二十七年內頒有「工業獎勵法」，「特種工業保息及補助條例」，「修正非常時期農礦工商管理條例和「中巖遷廠建設委員會」等法規，要旨不外採取（一）減低或免除出口稅和原料稅，（二）減低國營效果通事業的運輸費，（三）給予獎勵金，（四）專利權的享有，（五）保息實收資本的年息五厘，債票的年息六厘，（六）補助生產費，（七）協助次金設備的擴充，材料的供給，出品的運銷調劑，勞工的供給調劑，遷廠運費的貨予和代籌，廠址器材的安置，地畝收用動力供給之解決等等。新興工業的建設，對於獎勵華橋投資，除上述各項優待外，更予以安全的保障和榮譽紀念的頒給。</p>
<p>註：上述關於工業建設之各項官方條例，均</p>
<p>參攷中國國民經濟硏究所出版之「中外經濟年報」詳見該年報第七章破壞與建設之工業經濟。</p>
<p>政策雖然設想週到，但是成功的程度，還是決定在實施方法的得當與吾。從現實的環境來看，當局所採取的實施方法，路錢分國防工業的重工業，國防工業與和平工業交織的輕工業，及手工業三條，而且每條路錢，均由不同的主管機關辦理，更採取中央與地方政府分工合作的競賽方法，前者從事於國防工業與較大範圍而非地方能力及地方經濟所能勝任之工業；後者從事於國防與和平工業交織的輕工業，以黔省而論，與中央及民衆方面合資成立的貴州企業公司，資本定額爲國幣六百萬元，但其業務範圍則不僅工業一端，因此章程內規定之投資方法，分爲自行經營，與他公司合資經營，接受他公司或個人之委託代營及已經省府投資經營事業之經營或代理，而該公司經營已具成效的事業，如公私團體或個人願全部或部分之承受者，亦得續與之，此項實施方法，無疑的從供給資金方面以扶助及推進各種產業的發展。（註）：貴州工業基礎之奠定，實利賴焉。</p>
<p>註：詳見中國國民經濟研究所出版之「貴州經濟」第一章經濟之自然賦予與利用第八節統盤建設計劃下之貴州企業公司。</p>
<p>鄕村手工業與小工業，係由行政院撥款五百萬元，成立的中國工業合作協會所推動，該會計劃將全國分爲西北·西南·東南及華中四大區，分頭從事於已有的鄕村手工業·小工業的組織，而以合作方式調整產品的生產運銷調節，和動員民衆，從事於工業生產，施行以來，爲戰時工業建設的新姿態之一。</p>
<p>工業新陣容的雄姿</p>
<p>國防工業，事關秘密，非局外人所能明悉鄉村手工業和小工業，分佈較爲散漫，雖</p>
<p>「中國工業合作協會」，業已加以組織，但詳細報道，非本文篇幅所能容許；但中國的抗戰基礎旣建築在廣大的農村，則農村工業和小工業的發展，自具重大意義。</p>
<p>國防工業與和平工業效果織的輕工業，同為抗戰之中堅，川·黔·滇三省，自抗戰以來，戰區及其鄰近地帶民族工業之內遷者，及新建設者，與時並進。下表所列，即爲今日西南川·黔·滇三省新工業之雄姿：</p>

<h3 id="c93">法幣會成馬克乎 <a href="#c93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— 維</p>
<p>十八日起外滙黑市又趨暴縮，殷富人士，均爭購黃金外滙，一若馬克盧布之慘劇，瞬將重現於上海者，人心浮動，惶惶不可終日，其實法幣較諸當年馬克盧布，逈然不同，筆者目擊此種混亂，徒足擾動人心，因無切實理出，特就管見所及，揭而出之。</p>
<p>按大戰時馬克之跌落，由於德政府濫發紙幣，微收人民物資，造成通貨膨脹，致使價格在落，濫發馬克票，甚至印刷不及其膨脹槪可想見矣。反顧法幣，則非僅未見通貨膨脹之跡，且在暴縮之中。舉凡銀錢業之推行滙劃證，馬電限制提存，公債改付滙劃，俱足資爲佐證也。然則滙價何爲而暴縮乎？請爲一申述之。</p>
<p>一上海環境特殊，非政府權力所能統制？故產生黑市外滙，果能在政府管理之下，則黑市根本無由成立，亦不致逐月入超若是之鉅。或竟成爲一出超口岸，爲政府增厚外滙基金矣。即如現在之黑市，若無人破壊操縱亦不必至於如斯在落。蓋滙價築於進出口貨平衡之上。如進口貨値過於出口貨値，則外滙之需要旺，遂使滙價趨縮；外滙緊縮，則進口貨之價格，必隨而高昂，使人民自動節縮，或改用土貨，使進口减少。出口貨則必以外匯縮而增加，故滙價趨縮之後，即能自獲水準，而趨穩定，如前數年列强均曾以貨幣貶値爲增加出口奪取市塲之武器，稍具貨幣智識者，類能道之。顧法幣自抗戰以來，上海黑市滙價，在縮三分之二有零，而進出口仍不能趨於平衡，何哉？吾人試檢視此數月海關數字最鉅者，實爲棉花及雜糧之進口，即能恍然矣，蓋亦主持有人者也。</p>
<p>二黑市中除須償付入超外，某方常以攫奪而來之法幣，套取外滙，更以聯合準備銀行及華興銀行之偽鈔兌換，此外尙有每月關稅及統稅稅收，亦殊可觀。然則吾人能以外櫃基余無限供人利用以購買軍火乎？此爲人人所知萬萬不能者也。故平準基金委員會不得不取防禦手段，而使匯價緊縮也。</p>
<p>綜上所論，吾人已審知外滙之泓，不至使法幣如馬克，然則外滙緊縮，足以使人不奪取外滙乎？則叉決不能也。蓋彼所有法幣之來源，幾乎無成本之可言，除非法幣跌至彼奪取成本以下，（不會有）方能完全防止，吾則無論法幣在黑市中跌至何種程度，彼亦決不放棄共奪取之企圖也。故欲法幣自獲水準，實不能防止其奪取。故外匯之黑市塲，必須加限制，改絃易轍，方能收效。昨日市塲上外滙交易已無形趨於停頓，或爲取締黑市之先聲，然滙價旋由三辦士七五復回至四辦士三七五，似乎又有供給也。</p>

<p>這兩天因爲外匯暴縮，黃金飛漲出三千元的大關，道種驚人的消息實在令人咋舌！但細細的靜想一下，橫是黃金漲了，什麼都要漲的。焉知愛情的價値將更貴於黃金。所謂「黃金與貴爵難買美人心」。「春宵一刻値千金」。</p>
<p>一個花枝招展的妙齡女郞，一旦嫁了一個精力豐沛，思想新穎的英俊丈夫，他倆必然情深似海，快樂若仙，同時生男育女，組織着美滿家庭，生活是何等幸福！若嫁了一個患有早洩陽萎，發育不全的病夫。雖嘉禮之後，夫婦生活必不能美滿，或竟完全不能人道，這在妻子的芳心中有如雷殛樣的創傷，感覺着人生的虛空，結婚更屬無聊，此時丈夫雖用黃金與貴爵欲博妻子的歡心，恐亦是難乎其難的事情。如能用特效良藥把他的病體治好了。那立時可把懐情的妻子引入歡暢境地，使她恍然大悟人生的樂趣！</p>
<p>然則男子何以而有病態，據醫學上的淪斷，必因早年犯有自凟遺精或婚後的荒淫縱慾，把生殖腺液消耗太多，於是上述症象即勢難避矣。並且此種症象如不求治愈，不特喪盡婚後的幸福，且有形成未老先衰，危及生命之虞！</p>
<p>治療上述症象的唯一特效良藥，據世界名醫之千萬病案及余十餘年之實地經騐，均一致贊許生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」。因此劑係根據生殖腺補給療法之原理，由雄壯動物如猿猴，猩猩，海狗等體中提取的生殖腺素用科學方法複製而成。所以品質純粹而高貴，效力確實而偉大，服後於一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，助長發育。若繼續服用半月，必可將上述各症根木治愈。中老年人長服更可收延年益壽，返老還童之功。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則標木兼治，收效允速！</p>
<p>患者顧夢生君，今年春間結婚，患早洩陽萎甚劇，並有遺精，結婚迄今，據顧君稱：妻仍處女，不特妻子恨夫無能，有時竟怒火中燒。而顧君更負疚追悔，當年之自凟縱慾。而有今日之苦痛！乃求醫於余。投以大量「生殖素」及「希米脫氏固精片」同服，三日遺精即止，三星期已恢復了美滿健康。於是重圓好夢，樂勝於飛！</p>
<h3 id="c100">遺精症的對症發藥 <a href="#c100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>俗諺說：『對症發藥』。又說：『藥對如開鎖』。這是確然的。治病並非難事，未能察知其病根，那才是唯一的難事。旣知其病根而又無特效的藥物，則雖名醫大家，亦屬徒然！所以醫與藥是相得益彰的。</p>
<p>靑年人所以多遺精症？不外爲下列諸種原因，　自凟縱慾；　荒淫無度；　先天衰弱或病後失調；　用腦或用力過度以及憂勞斵傷之故。在以上種種原因中允以自凟縱慾的原因最居多數。因爲傷害性神經，使精關鬆弛，遺精症即繼之而起。如遺精日多，性神經的衰弱必愈劇於是凡滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，精力渙散，腦衰健忘，失眠心悸等症更相繼而來。此種靑年不特多病多痛，受盡苦楚，求學與習業，殊難成就；且因體貌不揚，易爲異性所棄，未婚者有陷於失戀的危機，已婚者恒爲妻不滿，家庭更將演出種種悲劇！所以遺精患者爲自身前途幸福計，爲家庭社會民族國家計，均應作及早治療。</p>
<p>在今日醫學昌明，我們不特已深知遺精的病根所在，並已有特效藥的發明，特效藥唯何？即已風行全球之「希米脫氏固精片」。此藥係完全適應遺精之病理。服後即能鞏固精關，鎮靜神經，使夜得安眠，夢幻減少，遺精可以當夜立止。如因遺精已有上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，精血及神經，於短期內必可恢復美滿健康。</p>
<p>患者朱志高君，年二十五歲，中學時代曾犯自凟，半年後即起遺精。中學雖勉强畢業，但未能升入大學。去年結婚，有早洩陽萎現象，上月求醫於余，即投以「希米脫氏固精片」及「生殖素」二者同時兼服。並施以電療注射三日遺精即愈。三星期後早洩陽萎亦覺霍然矣，且頭腦淸晰，精力豐富，與前判若兩人。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>每個男子，誰不願意選擇一位健康而美麗的女子，作他終身的伴侶呢？所以女子要想在情場中獲得勝利。對於她的健康，允其是乳峯一部的發育，不可不加注意！</p>
<p>蓋女性的乳祟，如果能够發育良好，在胸前燮峰高聳，並配合着苗條的身體，豐腴的臀部，所謂女性最神秘而可貴的曲線美，就完全顯露了。此種女性，因自身卵巢機能的健全，新陳代謝作用的旺盛之故，必然心曠體康，面露快樂的神情，行動舉止，亦必非常活潑，感情豐當，婚後夫婦間的愛情，更異常濃厚，組織着快樂的家庭，生育着伶俐的子女，不特她自身感到稱心滿意，即親友鄰居也交相羨慕，這不是人世間最幸福的女人嗎？可是過去如曾犯自凟束胸，或病後失調，先天衰弱，以及舊禮敎束縛，環境壓迫等種種原因，致患白帶不感，月經不調，貧血癆瘵等症。則卵巢機能即受摧殘，乳峯即無良好的發育，或雖有良好的發育，亦必漸漸萎　下去，馴至平坦得一如男子。此種女性，必爲男子所不喜，甚至年逾花信，尙無人爲她執柯，春光虛度，自嗟薄命！即一旦出嫁而後，亦必遭丈夫的厭惡，或竟遺棄不顧呢！唯一補救辦法，據世界婦科名醫康德林及余經騐。均公認服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」最爲對症而特效。蓋此劑成分高貴，配製精良，服後一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，如繼續服用，不惟可使萎癟的乳峯，變得隆然高聳，同時且能紅潤面頰，化醜陋爲嬌艷。白濁論壇</p>

<p>余於白濁的臨床上，已有十餘年之經騐，治療之人，何止千萬，而許多淋病患者，往往請余治療時，必詢余「我的白濁，何以不愈」？因爲許多患者，經過長時期之痛苦，多方面之醫治，（包括內服藥，電療，打針，手術）總難望其根治。往往由失望而灰心，由灰心而放縱，結果，本來可以根治之老白濁，反而成爲不能治之痼疾矣—豈非陷病人於萬刧暄復康健之途。兹試言其故：原來一班失治之淋病，約有三因，一爲誤服市上劣藥，二爲誤被庸陋而設備不完之醫家之誤治（亦包括誤用手術，及打針，服藥，電療等）。第三爲病家不知攝生，一味肆行無忌，皆爲使淋病久治不愈，或者可説　治而淋病愈頑固也。</p>
<p>由此言之，要求老白濁治愈，必先具有補救上述三種原因。由精密的科學方法診斷，如尿道鏡，膀胱鏡，顯微鏡等，爲這檢察病情，然後用德國樂根納博士所發明之濾淋平流電療法，或行局部之放射電流，或用電管插入尿道，使所有深部或局部之淋菌，完全撲滅。並濾淸其毒素（按一般電療，僅有少許殺菌作用，絶對無濾淸淋毒作用，讀者宜注意！）更佐以希氏血淸，電氣按摩，台維氏新式菩齊，特製自家菌苗等，隨症治療，則不僅頑固之慢性淋可治，舉凡急慢性淋中之前後尿道炎，攝護腺炎，睪凡炎，精囊炎，關節炎等，均可應手取效。　診時：上午九時至六時止</p>

<p>— 眉厓</p>
<p>醬油有精，滋味有素，一經調滲，便成邭廚美饌。『精』『素』的妙用如此，宜乎一般人對它生無限的信仰也！</p>
<p>宋岳珂愧鄰錄：『自國家取士塲屋，世以決科之學爲先。故凡編類條目撮載綱要之書，稍可便檢閱者，今充棟汗牛矣。建陽書肆，方日輯月刊，時異而歲不同，以冀速售；而四方轉致傳習，率携以入棘闈，務以眩有司，謂之懐挾，視爲故常。』我們看完了這段話後，馬上有個反應；不但醬油有精，書也有精；不但滋味有素，學也有素。所謂便檢閱的『編類條目撮載綱要之書』，便是書之精，學之素，那些從事決科之學的士子，『携以入闈，以眩有司，謂之懷挾，視爲故常』，自然也有其無上上的妙用在。</p>
<p>常敎育部厲行中小學畢業會考制度的時候，坊賈爲適應學生們記誦需耍計，所出會考指南一類『編類條目撮載綱要之書」，不是也能『充棟汗牛』嗎？許多企圖撈一筆外塊的書棍爲競爭計，不是也在『日輯月刊，時異而歲不同』嗎？今時値非常，會考制度已暫吿停止。市上會考指南一類的書，自然不像以前那樣的猖獗了。但其潛勢力仍相當雄厚。因爲『考』　不『會』，畢業仍得有『考』，旣有考，則指導便利考的一類書，絕對不會廢。筆者偶過一書坊，統其橱中所列「指南」等書，尙有十三四種之譜；不過悉係舊版，無復新編，同時什麽精華什麼百日通十日通之類的東西，却較前更爲活躍。照今日文化界演進的情形看起來，每一學科大的巳有一便於記誦的指南或無師自解的百日通十日通問世。一班莘莘學子，不必再下什應「下帷」什麼「焚膏繼晷」的苦工，儘可「秀才不出門，能通天下學」，眞是編一「指南」撰一「自通』勝造七級浮屠。</p>
<p>自然，一本書或一種學術，自有它最緊要處與其思想上的系統，編「指南」「自通」之類的述而不作者把它「編類條目撮載綱要」，以嘉惠後學，我們實在未可厚非。不過物質上「精」與素之類的妙用，在一遇湯羹，即行融解，而成美味。書本與學術上的『精」與「素』，要它一遇學生，即行發生融化作用，這却是成問題的。編「指南」「自通」之類的述而不作者，旨在賺錢；而案頭枕邊安放這類的「精」「素」的學生，也不過想利用它闖一下考關或於學問上討一些小便宜，根本談不到什麼融化。宋政和四年，嘗有利州路學事黃潛善奏禁懐挾之書，謂「比年以來，於時文中採摭陳言，區別事類，編决成集，便於剽竊，謂之決科。機要蝓惰之士，往往記誦以欺有司，讀之則似是，究之則不根於經術本源之學。爲害不細。」當天下滔滔之日，潛善此奏，不免迂隘之見；當然，我們也還不至如此不識相。</p>
<p>不過，我相信；自醬油有精，滋味有素，而天下多美味；自書木有精，學術有素，而天下多無根之士；這該是有心人所不能放心的事吧？</p>

<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>——戰地追記</p>
<p>懐着留戀的熱情吿別了商城，向入皖的大道邁進，周圍綿延不斷的山脈，在微笑地迎迓着我們，眞是多麽愉快的旅行啊！絲瓜墩是第一旅程，距離縣城僅有三十五里，路面難然很平坦，但碰到了亂石峋嶙的深溪，便不能不涉水而過，湍急的溪流瀠繞着沒到近膝的脚脛，那麼汹湧地奔騰着，如果立足不穩的話，就會捲入漩渦的；可是祇要你有勇氣，有決心，什麽困難，都可以克服的，何况涉水！</p>
<p>絲瓜墩全鎭，祇有疏朗朗的二十五戶，當我們到達街梢的時候，老百姓馬上從各處走集攏來，用驚異的眼光注視着。</p>
<p>「怎麽啦，俺們幹得很好吧？」啣着早烟袋的老人關心地問，烟從他的鼻孔噴出來，接着，一陣咳嗆，吐了一口濃痰。</p>
<p>「很好！」小沈答道。</p>
<p>他吿訴我們：他的兒子跟姪兄早已被徵入伍，以前在長沙受訓，現在開拔到什麽地方，雖則沒有知道，但爲拯救祖國，即使戰死，也非常光榮的。「又是一個奇蹟，」我這樣想。眞的，在豫鄂皖三省邊區的老百姓，都具有樸素，誠實，爽直的美德；然而民族意識能够像這樣的深刻，原因到底在那裏呢？原來種籽的播布，却不能不歸功於過去數年的關係，允其是所謂「圍剿」時期。在經濟方面，自從四周燃起了烽火，已經直接威脅着他們的生活，壅滯於鄉村間的農產品，如雜糧，大麻，藥材等等，因爲運輸的阻斷，無法向都市銷售，大家就會感到誰是破壊他們生活的對象，而憤怒，詛咒，仇視，終於加强了政洽的認識。</p>
<p>飽餐了一頓玉蜀黍，便繼續趲行，在下午三時光景，開始投入大別山的懐抱；盤旋曲折的山徑，巍然高聳的峰巒，跟無奇不有的洞壑，假如在平時，你準會恣意欣賞的。翻過一座山頭，路越來越窄，山坡幾乎成爲垂直的角度，俯視下面的深坎，不禁慄慄危懼起來。直到「夕陽明滅亂山中」的時候才趕到了安徽省境的蘇仙石，由於當地聯保主任的招待，在破廟中解決了宿夜問題。恰巧敎廳巡迥演講隊從附近的鄕村回來，把三間寬敞的殿堂擠滿了。據傾隊說：「兩個月的演講工作，使我獲得了許多的經騐，跟農民他們講話，越通俗越好，而且要顧到他們的工作時間，挺好採取隨便談談的方式，這才能够打動他們的心弦……」他滔滔不絕地說着，而歸結到文化人必須回到鄕村去，在城市裏舉行什麽座談會，那是無補於事的，「坐而言，不如起而行，」這樣結束了他的談話。</p>
<h3 id="c105">鼓 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 俊伯</p>
<p>我現在所要吿訴你的是一面鼓的故事，雖然我不是一個最好的鼓手。</p>
<p>我的開始和它熟悉，決不是偶然的一件事。我很早已知道它的名字；曾有過好幾個黃昏，我爲着它光榮的故事發在。記得是一個沉默的日午，我頭上冒若汗，背誦自己祖先的功績，忽然就想到了鼓。於是，儘量用想像的能力去刻劃它的容貌。我說，它至少是够英武的，因爲我曾聽見過它雄壯的呌喊。我相信它不會有一决屈辱的遭遇，它有的是組暴的反抗。永遠是那麽地平凡，它的動作。</p>
<p>慶賀自己的命運，我現在是一面鼓的忠實的伙伴了。是春風帶走花枝憔悴的時候，我在海灘上拾來一面鼓。用一個貝殼試騐它的能耐，我驕傲地笑了。於是，我開始自己的歌唱，走遍天涯的東西，用熱汗換來了興奮的痛快。</p>
<p>是時間的牽引，今天我踱到了這裏。感謝你們熱烈的讚頌，我的鼓更有勁了。不錯，有許多啟示潛伏在這簡單的鼓聲中，讓你們在平凡中找尋神奇吧！</p>

<p>— 智</p>
<p>我們時常聽見一句話：「你的飯是我給你吃的。」</p>
<p>說這話的，大都免廠主，商店老板，公司經理，以及機關中的高級職員這些大人物，而聽這話的，自然是工人，夥計，學徒，以及小職員這些起碼人。大人物確乎覺得理直氣壯，振振有詞，起碼人也確乎唯唯諾諾，鞠躬盡瘁，死而無怨。他們似乎彼此都很明白自己的地位，以及和對方的關係：大人物將飯給起碼人吃，而起碼人吃大人物的飯。</p>
<p>然而起碼人中，却也有幾個頗不以爲然的。他們說，最起碼的猪獨，一些不會做什麽，却還用牠們身上的肉，來償還牠們向人類所吃的飯，人類中的起碼者，工人等，爲廠主工作賺錢，亦何嘗白吃了廠主等的飯呢！廠主等旣不必以此自傲，工人等也不必以此自卑！</p>
<p>當然，大人物也會對某一個起碼人說，一我不用別人只用你，這就是我特別待你好，你應該感激我。」頭腦簡單的起碼人，常然也就會感激這樣的大人物。但是，我想，這樣的大人物，會將這樣的話對每一個他所用的人說，那末，他對於某一個所用的人，究竟有什麼特別恩意呢？</p>
<p>事情倒不如老實說穿的好：大人物的地位，是起碼人造成的；換言之，起碼人的飯固然是大人物所給與的，而大人物的享用，苦飯以上的享用，却也正是起碼人所給與的。兩邊對扯過來，起碼人並沒有吃大人物的飯，起碼人是吃自己的飯。直接一句：誰也沒有吃誰的飯，誰都吃自己的飯，甚至猪玀也吃自己的飯！</p>
<p>所不同的，是起碼人笨一些（正當的說法），或者良心平一些（過火的說法），所以形成了食於人的樣子，按之「各盡所能，各取所需」的原則，他們是無所慚愧的，因爲照我看，猪玀將肉供人吃，因此食於人，也是無所慚愧的！</p>
<p>我願意大家不再聽見「你的飯是我給你吃的」這句話。誰耍再說這話，我也希望聽見的人老實回敬一下：「你的飯也是我給你吃的！」</p>

<p>手在空中搖了一陣沉默了。</p>
<p>「我不同你到任何地方去！」阿玖斯尼亞不等他說下去，搖着頭堅定的說了。</p>
<p>「任何地方都——我都想去——你也去吧……」瓦西卡小聲的說。</p>
<p>「什麼地方都不去！」</p>
<p>「不過，我可不這麽想……但是，耍去，就去吧。』</p>
<p>「不！已經……」</p>
<p>「這麼嗎？惡魔！」瓦西卡激怒了，說，『原來你是騙騙我的，……你現在（向胸口裝個擲石的樣子）是這樣的嗎？」</p>
<p>「這不是這麽說……」阿玖斯尼亞不慌不忙的說，「可是，和你一起過活……我不願意！我怕你……你是個大惡人呀！」</p>
<p>「說什麽，你誤會我了吧？」瓦西卡不高興地呌着，「惡人！你才是個蠢女人……你仔細給我想一想——惡人？可是在這邊的人，有誰不兇惡呢？你不這麼想嗎？——兇惡有什麼了不得呢？」</p>
<p>他打斷自己的話，以未受傷的手撫着自己的胸口，沈默了一會。接着聲音裏含着憂鬱，眼裏露出恐懼，重新說道：</p>
<p>「你爲什麼……那樣子呢？惡人，有誰不是惡人呢？你幹麽問我這個？一道走吧，阿玖斯尼亞·謝米諾夫娜！」</p>
<p>「請你不要再提起這個！我是不去的！」阿玖斯尼亞堅持着自己的意見，懐疑的跑開了。</p>
<p>他們的商量叉打斷了。月光照入房裏來，在月影下瓦西卡的臉顯得很蒼白，他的眼睛忽閉忽開，永遠默默的躺在床上。樓下是跳着，唱着，歡笑着。</p>
<p>阿玖斯尼亞呼呼的鼾聲叉起來了。瓦西卡深深的嘆着氣。</p>
<p>叉過了兩天，鴇母在醫院找着空位了。醫生助手和院丁放了病車來接瓦西卡了。人們小心翼翼的把瓦西卡扶下樓來。他在望着擠在門上的姑娘們。</p>

<p>— 徐佐良</p>
<p>本刊第七期有懲治貪汚之法沿革一文，對於懲治貪污之法則，自秦漢晋唐宋元明淸以迄於民國，歷舉無遺，誠足以使實汚官吏有所警惕。然余以爲此乃懲治貪汚已然之刑法，非所以防患於未然也。夫官吏之財何所取，取於國家之俸給耳；在國定制，固宜厚其俸精，使事實上足以養廉，而相對的又宜設定限制以杜其微漸。蓋官吏俸給依官吏等級有特定之數額，無論年月久暫，俸給多寡，均不難的計其盈絀，使其廉隅克礪，已無患其不能自給，果有遠出俸給之所得，爲其職梗地位所能致，而爲法理所不可有者，即當究其財產所由來。故國家不欲懲治貪汚則巳，果欲懲洽貪汚，自應精核其私有財產是吾有溢出俸給之所得，爲正本淸源之計。溯明淸以前官吏之私有財產，因犯罪關係常爲國家査抄入庫，達官顯宦多不敢彰明較著擁有巨產，洎乎民國，對於官吏嚴禁官邪，不憚三令五申以致其誥誡，然軍閥顯宦，歛有巨資，號稱千萬或數百萬元者不一而足；等而下之，如廳長局長，亦常有以極短任期一轉瞬而成巨富者。國家雖定有嚴刑峻法，而無如滔滔者之愍不知畏，或且視同具文，無一顧之價値；此無他，犯罪首重證據，果不獲收贓受賄之罪證，即明知其有此事實，亦屬無法檢舉置之於罪，是猶惡濕而任其居下者也。茲就管見所及，應訂制限官吏私有財產法，以爲澄淸官吏完成建國之大端，爰擬原則如下。</p>
<p>一，凡官吏於就任前，應將原有財產無論不動產動產均須列表一一向主管官署登記，由主管官署彙案送審計院詳爲稽核。若爲現任官吏，即應於制限官吏私有財產法施行之日登記之。</p>
<p>二，官吏不得兼營商業，與民爭利。其商業爲遺傳，或在爲官吏以前原有者，應於就任官吏前，呈請主管官署轉陳審計處核准，方得繼續營業。但其所營商業，與其官吏職務或統屬有關者，應絕對禁止；並防其以妻妾或子女名義行之，或化名戤戶。</p>
<p>三，化名戤戶之營業，或其所得款項，審核結果確認其爲不當利得，而發現在離任之後者；不論年月遠近，均得依法沒收之。</p>
<p>四，官吏之私有財產遇有變更時，應列表爲上項登記；即無變更，每年亦至少列表向主管官署登記一决，將原有私產之收支及官吏俸給所得之盈餘詳爲記載。准許經營之商業，應附交商業報吿書，由審計院審核之。</p>
<p>五，凡審計機關審核其官吏私產，如査有越出其官吏俸給者，應詳密審究其來源，如査有貧汚嫌疑，即令管轄法院偵查之。</p>
<p>六，官吏私有財產，無論爲商業所得，或官俸所積，並其利息，須限制一最高數額？若越過一定限度者，其溢出之部份，應悉數沒收入官，官秩大小，並量予分別限制之。</p>
<p>七，官吏私有財產之限制，以該受制限之官吏死亡後，承繼開始時起十年爲度。</p>
<p>以上所舉，不過犖犖大者，其他應行規定之事項，還希山立法者詳密考訂之。</p>

<p>民事訴訟法第二百五十一條第一項規定：「訴狀應與言詞辯論期日之傳票一併送達於被吿。」此項規定之所謂「訴狀」，自當解爲訴狀正本，夫訴訟旣與言詞辯論日之傳票一併送達於被吿，則法院內卷宗所存者尙有何物？此處所謂「訴狀」，似應改爲訴狀繕本，吾則，無以解其惑也。</p>

<p>此項規定之所謂「言詞辯論筆錄一，亦欠妥當，蓋判決前言詞辯論終結後，言詞辯論筆錄即不應再爲各種記載，捨　上訴權旣非言　辯論，又係在言詞辯論終結之後，何以又以之記戰於該筆錄？寗非不易理解者乎？是則似以另製宣判筆錄之爲當也。</p>
<p>編者按：言詞辯論之意義，廣狹原有不同。就最廣義言之，凡常事人所爲一定之聲明，法律上事實上之主張，以及法院所爲訴訟指揮，證據調査，宜示裁判等諸行爲，均屬之。狹義之辯論，則除調査證據及裁判之宣示而言。最狹義之辯論，乃專指當事人於言詞辯論期日之訴訟行爲而言，我民訴法第二百十三條規定言詞辯論筆錄內應記載車項，範圍頗廣，蓋採最廣義者也，則同法第四百三十六條第二項規定尙無不可。</p>
<h3 id="c112">不履行婚約損害賠償問題之商榷 <a href="#c112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— 陸仁浩</p>
<p>婚約者，爲一男一女以將來結婚爲目的所訂立之預的也，婚的之訂定，無須履行一定方式，以雙方當事人之意思表示一致爲已足，惟除男子未滿十七歲，女子未滿十五歲，爲法律明文所禁止，及未成年人應取得法定代理人之同意外，應出男女當事人自行爲之，（民法第九七二，九七三，九七四條，）其非由當事人自行訂定，又未微得雙方本人之同意者，其婚的應歸無效，（參司法院二三年院字第一一七四號解釋）關於婚的之效力，我民法第九七五條明定，「婚的不得强迫股行」，蓋對於人之身體，强制執行，事實上旣多窒碍，且仍不能達到婚姻之目的，故法院遇有悔婚案件，僅能以和平方法盡力勸論之，（參大理院九年上字六一五號判例，最高法院十九年上字第一五，五號判例，）夫婚的旣不能强迫履行，則如於婚的訂定後任由當事人之一方隨意不履行，致使他方因此受有損害，亦非事理之平，是以我民法有第九七七，九七八，九七九條之規定，使有過失之一方，負賠償無過失之他方所受損害之責，藉以保障婚的，而免影響社會之公序良俗，因婚的不履行而賠償損害之情形有二，茲分述如下。</p>
<p>（一）解除婚的之賠償　解除婚的之賠償者，即婚的當事人之一方，如因他方有法定解的原因之一，（民法第九七六條），而請求解的，致受損害者，得向有過失之他方請求賠償因此所受之損害，（民法第九七七條），此之所謂損害著，係專指財產上積極的或消極的損害而言，（民法第九七九條第一項之對照解釋）</p>
<p>（二）違反婚的之賠償　違反婚的者，即無故不履行婚的之謂，婚約旣不能請求强迫履行，則當事人之一方，自可任意違反，置之不顧，是婚的之保障，直等於無，故我民法第九七八條規定，「婚的當事人之一方，無第九七六條之理由，而違反婚的者，對於他方因此所受之損害，應負賠償之責，」此種損害，不以財產上之損害爲限，雖屬精神上之損害，亦得請求賠償相當之金額（民法第九七九條）。</p>
<p>綜上觀之，解除婚的及違反婚的，雖同屬不履行婚的，而有過失之一方，所負損害賠償之責任，則顯有輕重之別，此在立法者，必以爲無故不履行婚的之情形，較之有法定原因而解除婚的者，允爲可惡，是以加重其責任，使其對於他方精神上之損害，亦應負責賠償，但旣同樣使無過失之相對人，於婚的所爲之準備行爲歸於徒勞，精神上感受痛苦，致受有形無形之損害，而於損害賠償之責任，有所軒輊，似有不當，縱使理論上不無相當理山。而於適用上定多窒碍，且易爲狡猾者所利用，例如當事人之一方，於婚的訂定後，旋忽翻悔，但他方並無民法第九七六條所具情形，無從依法解的，而又深知無故違反婚的，將依民法第九七八，九七九條之規定，賠償他方因此所受之財產上精神上之損害，故雖有解的之意，並不向對方表示，而逕行再與他人訂婚或結婚，或另與他人通姦，故意造成民法第九七六條法定解的原因之一，使他方除與解除婚的外，別無救濟之道，而解除婚約時，又僅能請求賠償財產上之損害，（民法第九七七條，第九七九條，）旣須確實證明損害之確數，而爲數亦屬有限，彼違反婚約者，反得遂其避重就輕之狡謀，於情於理，均有未洽，且此種情事，較之無故違反婚的者，允爲可惡，而責任反見减輕，是豈立法之本旨哉，故我民法第九七九條第一項之規定所稱「前倐情形」，似宜改爲「前二條情形」，使有過失之一方，於違反第九七六條所列法定原因之一而解除婚的時，對於無過失之他方，亦須負擔賠償精神上損害之責任，或謂，若照此修改，對於一般狡獪之徒，固能知所警惕，但對於確實僅有第九七六條所列情形之一而解除婚的之當事人，亦强令加重其責任，似有未當，余意由民法第九七七條觀之，彼常事人旣有法定解的原因之一，又有相當過失，致使其無過失之相對人蒙受損害，則責令兼負精神上之損害賠償，亦未爲過當，如此可使一般人在訂定婚的前，多加考慮，不致貿然從事，而婚的訂定後，不敢任意構成解除婚的之原因，俾婚的得以有所保陣，不致有窒碍難行之弊，確保社會之公序良俗，其在是乎，區區管見，是吾有當，尙希高明指正是幸。</p>

<h3 id="c114">永久的朋友 <a href="#c114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— 予且</p>
<p>從今天起上海業餘話劇界假座黃金大戲院舉行慈善公演一星期。這樣大規模的聯合公演，不但事關善舉，更且爲「孤島」劇運留着一頁光榮的史蹟。今天公演的是夜鷹劇社的「永久的朋友」，予且先生就是該劇的導演。編者</p>
<p>「永久的朋友」是我的朋友的作品，它的演出，也全是靠着幾個朋友。這個劇本可以說從寫出直到演出，都是朋友們在一塊兒研究的成績。說導演，根本就沒有導演。我們只想因幾個朋友的努力，可以得着更多的朋友，而且是永久的朋友。</p>
<p>因爲我們期望得着永久的朋友，朋友們的稱贊和譴責，我們都一律的含笑承受蒲，人情上我們是應該如此的。</p>
<p>我常想到演劇有三怕，一怕劇本認識小足，二怕表演的不像，三怕對於觀衆觀感上不融洽。這個劇本的作者也參加表演指導，我們便無所謂認識不足。劇中旣無偉大驚奇的佈景，劇中人也都是些極平凡的人所以也無所謂像不像。就事實說，又不是古代的，又不是外國的，更也母庸慮到觀衆觀感上融洽不融洽。在這種情形之下，我們不應該說困難，吃苦，費力，花錢。但是我們同時也想到容易的事難以做的好，好像我們在校中作文，容易題目難得好分數。一是先生期望於我們的過高，二是自己本也太欠缺。</p>
<p>這劇本的主題很簡單，就是兩男愛一女。作者在劇本尙未寫成的時候就吿訴我說，他預備寫一個兩男愛一女的戲劇。當時我就想着大概裏面總有一塲決鬥，這種緊張奮興的塲面定然很好看的。或不是鬥力，乃是鬥智，用種種新奇的設計來進行攻擊和防禦，也足以使人動魄驚心的。後來又想到，也許是個悲劇，來一套生離死別。也許是個喜劇，來一個君子契的，成就一雙兩好。那知作者旣不用緊張奮興，驚心動魄，也不用悲哀或是輕鬆來公然刺激觀衆情緒。他把緊張和奮興的情緒，壓在心底。動魄驚心的事藏在骨子裹。悲哀是潛伏的，輕鬆是虛飾的。喜怒哀樂愛憎，全是人生之不協調，虛僞，冷酷，無情的表徵。這是一個處處都沒有戀愛處處都有戀愛從心田深處發出來的戲。於此我們知道作者是用了極平凡的情節來說明人生之不協調，虛偽，和冷酷無情。用了極平凡的語句，襯出隱藏在心田深處的喜樂和悲哀。他可以算是用了容易題目做出了好文章。可是在擔任演出的一班朋友們，有些時候感到了容易的話不好說，容易的動作不好做。</p>
<p>在排演的時候，我是和一班扮演的朋友在一塊兒說笑的，所以我深知道他們對於容易上口的話，容易入手的動作絕不輕易放過。有時固然自己認爲滿意，有時不免覺着困難。不過在困難的時候，我們有一個絕妙的解決方法，就是我們對於陳歌辛先生作的一支曲，都感到有濃厚的趣味。我們常在低唱那「晚風歌」的時候會有特別靈感的。很有幾處困難都在唱過了「晚風歌之後無意中得了解決。此外我們在排演感到疲乏的時候，「晚風歌」也提起了我們的精神，增强了我們的活動力。所以平心的說，在排演中帮助力最大的是什麽？那便是「晚風歌」。我們應該感謝誰？那便是陳歌辛先生。</p>
<h3 id="c115">夏令兒童健康會 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>免費診療所十一處遍及全市　中西醫士熱心加入義務診療</p>
<p>兩個月的暑假差不多將過去了一半，光陰眞快，再過一個月，各學校又要開課了。在暑假裏，爲了一般的兒童，都不到學校去上課，每天守在家裏，生活也比較放蕩一些。結果爲了食物的沒有節制，衣服的調節不當，或許會害起病來。大家知道，夏天是一個多病的季節，允其今回的暑天，兩决颶風，使天氣冷熱無常，格外容易生病。</p>
<p>本市的私立學校聯誼會，爲促進兒童的健康起見，就決定在本年的暑假裹，主辦一個夏令兒童健康會。本來預定要進行的工作可分六項，第一步先從醫藥兩項工作人手。在全市設立免費診療所十一處，爲兒童免費診療疾病，而且事前由該會和中西藥號接洽的結果，病兒購藥，更可享特別的折扣。</p>
<p>自二十四日起，十一處兒童免費診療所，將正式開幕，專爲病兒診治。聯誼會方面，事前印就了免費診療券兩萬張，除了分發給各學校轉給學生以外，各界人士，如果家有病兒，也可到各診療所索取。這樣可减輕一般市民的醫藥負擔，而同時又可增進兒童健康。而且不限在學兒童，就是普通失學的兒童，也可享到免費診療，廉價購藥的權利。</p>
<p>雖然是免費診療，但所聘的中醫西醫，都是相當聞名的。由國醫公會執行委員蕭退庵醫士擔任醫藥主任一職，其他熱心的醫士，願意免費爲全市兒童治病的，有四十多人。免　　費診療所的地點，暫設十一處，散佈到租界每一個角落，各診療所的地址是：（一）北京路八五六號二樓私校聯誼會，（二）康腦脫路延平路人文中學，（三）戈登路昌平路北立人小學，（四）赫德路南姚口震公小學，（五）北浙江路一四六弄滬江小學，（六）愛而近路北河南路口樂華中學，（七）蕪湖路六四號市中中學，（八）梅白格路三成坊人和小學，（九）慕爾鳴路德慶里願生小學，（十）愛多亞路南京大戲院對面新生小學，（十一）新閘路九三九弄單民小學。患病的兒童，都可就近求醫診治。</p>
<p>的確，目前生活程度是這樣高，一般的市民，都在嚴重壓迫之下，允其請醫生診費貴得嚇人，而藥價也特別高貴。貧苦的人家，孩子有了病，每是無力就醫，聽天由命。（不但兒童，就是大人也是如此。）無辜的兒童，爲了病不求醫，以致枉死者，每年怕也不少。兒童是國家未來的主人翁，今日枉死一個兒童，就使他日國家喪失一分原氣，所以促進兒童健康，是一件要務。而這决私校聯誼會的組織夏令兒童健康會，設立兒童免費診療所等，是値得我們頌揚的。不過筆者深望該會除了醫藥之外，對於指導兒童生活的合於健康原則，衛生條件等積極的工作，也須同時進行，使全市兒童加倍獲益，那造福人笨，才是不淺哩！</p>

<p>“King　of　Chinatown”</p>
<p>派拉蒙出品　國泰劇院映</p>
<p>黃柳霜會經演過不少辱華的影片，這顯然是由於美國電影劇作者對中國缺乏深刻的認識，而黃柳霜自己也一樣對祖國的現狀隔膜得很，以致「抽大烟」成爲代表中國的特徵，其實，這並不是中國的特產，倒是列强用戰爭的「禮貌」恭送給我們的「文明的禮物」啊！</p>
<p>然而，這種特奇的想頭總於在文明的腦袋里破減了。中國已不僅僅是知道火藥可以製造爆竹，也懂得用它製成軍火來抵抗侵略。屠殺槍掠的强盜不是中國人，而是那些威脅世界安全的法西斯蒂的國家。像這樣的局面放在美國劇作者面前，已不允許他們對中國憑空任意的描寫成一個「野蠻的古國」。自然，黃柳霜的親歷祖國一决，也正多少地糾正了她對於祖國的錯誤的觀念。</p>
<p>「中華女兒」並不是一個針對中國現狀的電影，但，它沒有任意誣衊中國，已經很使我們高興的了；何况，它的結尾還鼓勵中國在美學醫的人回到祖國來効勞呢！眞的，在美國鍍金回來的醫學博士，能有幾個願意到前綫去爲受傷的戰士而服務？不虐待窮苦的病家已經是够好的了。「中華女兒」的劇作者在這上面，他是極力主張對病人負資任，以盡翳道的。</p>
<p>就整個劇本來講，不能說是一個好的作品，故事是那麽平淡，而編製的技巧又是缺乏戲劇性。</p>
<p>戲的演出的不够緊張，導演應該負很大責任的，至少在「暗殺」和「破獲」的二塲戲上可以有很刺激的空氣，現在却讓很淡然的過去了。而且，導演對中國的舊印象還沒有完全消滅掉，如描寫中國人在美國過新年，依舊是瓜帽，馬褂，依舊玩龍燈，放爆竹，在描寫中國人的恣態上，總難免有些呆瞪瞪的。</p>
<p>黃柳霜的演技還是老樣子，平平穩穩地，沒有運用臉部表情和身子的動作，缺乏情感的流露。阿金泰米洛夫飾巴杜林，雖然很老練，也不能表達流氓的神恣。薛尼托勒是陳査禮的繼替者，在這里飾一個林章醫生——黃柳霜的父親，他的化妝還相常酷似中國長者，面部表情也有中國人的味兒，祇是在動作上有時難免洋化，如對女兒的親熱，作擁抱狀。那個菲力甫韓還是死樣怪氣，一無進步。</p>

<p>第十四回　烟火千家鄉村合作　波濤萬里瀛海飛行</p>
<p>但是一樣的人類，爲什麼有的吃得好，有的吃得壞呢？爲什麼有錢人家的狗，比了窮苦人家的孩子，營養的還要富足呢？爲什麼上海有位某太太，養了一只貓，到冬天，放在絲綿被頭裹，遺要用熱水袋給它暖被窩。而冀南魯北，災區裹的人民，十五六歲的吃得下，然後做得動。從前有些專制獨裁統治者，常說「不要牛油，只要大砲。」可是到後來大砲不能動了，爲什麼呢？原來沒有吃牛油的人去運動它，大砲都生了銹了。爲了這個緣故，我們的當局和民衆，對於民食，極爲重視。一方面，對於糧食的出產，不但是在量上，求其增多，幷且在質上，也加以改進。在各省內地，設了許多的農業學校，稻麥試騐塲，農業合作社。近幾年來沿，海各省的農業人材，都到內地去了。連自由村裏朱村長的有兩個老朋友兒子，稍爲懂得一點集體農塲組織的，也被河南聘請去了。其次就要說到燃料。新中國因爲種種開發，用得最廣的，便是液體燃料，如煤油之類。航空事業的發展，公路的開通，日增月盛，這兩項可就了不得呢。又因爲中國自已出產的煤油，暫時還不夠用，要借助於美國蘇俄。所以一面在極力開源，一面又不能不節流，好在這楚用之於最前進的物質上的，若在別的地方，可以用他種燃料來代替。便是別種液體燃料，發明的植物油中，也有不少咧。液體燃料之外，便要說到煤。煤是中國最富有的，人家一向對於中國的煤，涎羨不已。即就山西一省，你說可用到幾百年，他說可用到幾千年，其實都是廢話而已。（一六二）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Advance of the Chinese Army in Southern Shanxi Toward Yangcheng; Japanese Troops Fleeing North from Dongfeng Are Being Annihilated Separately; Chinese Army in Southern Henan Smashes into Northern Gate of Xinyang, Seizing Many Spoils; Chinese Army in Northern Hunan Recaptures Yunxi, Attacks Bazimen, Threatens Yueyang <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news received here today, the Japanese army's offensive in southeastern Shanxi Province (i.e., the Taihang Mountains) has now collapsed. The Chinese army there is now clearing out the remaining Japanese forces in the area. Dongfeng, twelve miles west of Yangcheng, has been recaptured by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops fleeing northeast have been cut into countless small sections by the Chinese army from both sides, without contact with each other, and are now being annihilated separately. Furthermore, the Chinese troops on the east bank of the Qin River are now advancing rapidly westward, aiming to encircle the Japanese troops entrenched in Yangcheng from both front and rear. This Chinese force is now only ten miles away from Yangcheng. At the same time, another Chinese unit has defeated the Japanese troops advancing south from Yangcheng and is continuing to advance north. Therefore, the Japanese troops in Yangcheng are in a predicament of being attacked on three sides. The 3,000 Japanese troops who invaded and occupied Gaoping in southern Shanxi are now divided into two routes, heading west. The Japanese troops in Hejin have also suffered a severe blow from the Chinese army, with extremely heavy losses. The Chinese guerrillas operating in the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway area are now besieging Zhenjiang. The Japanese authorities have mobilized 3,000 reinforcements to provide support. According to news from Guilin, the Japanese army has notified foreign nationals in southern Fujian to evacuate as soon as possible, saying that there will be fighting there soon. It is also reported that the Japanese are now building defensive fortifications on Chuanshi Island outside the Min River estuary and building an airfield in Shantou. At the same time, they are actively repairing the Chaoshan Railway, which was completely destroyed by Chinese guerrillas. The Nansun Railway, now in Japanese hands, is also in extreme difficulty, because on the one hand it is constantly attacked by Chinese guerrillas, and on the other hand it is further damaged by mountain floods. It is reported that in the twenty miles from Mazhouling to Shahe, the tracks have been completely destroyed by guerrillas, two railway bridges have also been blown up, and at the same time, the roadbed has been completely washed away by mountain floods. It is also reported that the water of the Yellow River is now rising sharply again, and there is a risk of flooding in the new Yellow River, which is twenty-five miles east of the Pinghan Railway and south of the Longhai Railway. At the same time, eastern Henan has virtually become a no-man's land, with neither the Chinese nor Japanese side having the convenience of military operations there. Only a very small number of Chinese farmers remain there. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) After the Chinese army recaptured Dongfeng Town (west of Yangcheng) on the 19th, the remaining Japanese troops fled along the Dongchang Avenue. The Chinese army immediately pursued the fleeing enemy and occupied places such as Nanbeiciguan (northeast of Dongfeng), killing many Japanese soldiers. At 4:00 PM on the 20th, the Chinese and Japanese armies fought fiercely repeatedly north of Zhou, and the highlands near west Yangcheng were occupied. The remaining Japanese troops retreated eastward in a disorderly manner.

<p>(Luoyang) In southern Henan, after the failure of the Japanese army's northern invasion from Changtaiguan, the Chinese side has changed its passive position to a mobile posture. Brave soldiers of the Chinese army, on the night of the 17th, with swift action, suddenly attacked the Japanese troops in Weiwan and Zhengwan west of Xinyang. The Japanese were caught off guard and fought in a panic, suffering heavy casualties. After a short fierce battle, the Japanese fled in a panic. At midnight on the 18th, the Chinese army attacked the northern gate of Xinyang and the railway station, etc. The Japanese, relying on solid fortifications, did not dare to fight, and only densely fired artillery blindly. At dawn, the Chinese army, due to the intense artillery fire, shifted southwest, but saw raging fires in the city, with several places already on fire. On the nights of the 18th and 19th, the Chinese army attacked the city gate twice, killing hundreds of Japanese soldiers. Finally, with the arrival of large Japanese reinforcements, they withdrew to the XX area on the morning of the 20th and confronted the Japanese. About a thousand Japanese troops from Changtaiguan and Shanchuandian, taking advantage of a certain Chinese unit advancing towards the area of Wudian Huangzhuang (southwest of Changtai) on the 19th, sneaked into Xutang (northwest of Changtai), attempting to harass. On the 20th, after a certain Chinese unit was dispatched to encircle and attack, after a day of fierce fighting, more than three hundred Japanese soldiers were killed.

<h3 id="e2">Anglo-Japanese Negotiations: Impact on the Chinese Side - Observations from Chongqing Political Circles <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chinese people here mostly hold pessimistic views regarding the news from Tokyo about Anglo-Japanese negotiations, because such news all seems to indicate that the British and Japanese sides are trending towards compromise. In the future, Britain's attitude towards the Sino-Japanese War may undergo significant changes. Chinese officials are unwilling to comment before obtaining more concrete and detailed reports. As of yesterday, most officials believe that Britain will definitely not stop at making considerable concessions, and will be able to limit the negotiations to local issues in Tianjin without taking actions that indirectly harm China's war of resistance. However, according to the results of the Associated Press reporter's interview with the Chinese authorities here, although they mostly acknowledge Britain's current dilemma of being unable to take care of both East and West, they all said that if Britain compromises with Japan, Britain's interests in China and the Far East will inevitably disappear, creating a huge mistake that will be regretted endlessly. As for the financial circles, they believe that no matter how the current Anglo-Japanese negotiations develop, there is no need to worry excessively. First, China still has substantial foreign exchange reserves overseas. At the same time, the new loan from the United States may be established soon, because the loan is currently being negotiated in Washington. Third, the establishment of the Sino-Soviet trade agreement is also of considerable help to China. Fourth, China is still actively increasing exports and reducing imports. Therefore, although China welcomes Britain's help, it is not a problem even if Britain does not help, because China does not rely solely on Britain's help. According to observations from neutral foreigners, even if Britain and Japan completely tend towards compromise, although it can affect China's finances, it will definitely not affect China's continued war of resistance. At the same time, after the Anglo-Japanese compromise, China may lean more towards the Soviet Union and the United States, and among these two countries, China's tendency towards the Soviet Union is more concerned with China both in terms of territorial distance and interests than the United States. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) This morning, the Chinese newspapers here did not see any detailed records of the agreements said to have been agreed upon in yesterday's Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, only saying "negotiations are in progress" and "Britain will not sacrifice its friends to help Japan". Currently, officials here have not yet made any criticism of the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo. It is widely believed that the Chinese authorities are now awaiting official statements from London. The Chinese authorities do not want to comment before London and Tokyo issue statements on the Tianjin case tomorrow, because they must wait until they see the statements from both places before they can know the truth of the talks in Tokyo, and then they will decide their opinions. London officials are silent about the results of the talks in Tokyo. It is said that all the news released so far has come from Tokyo. People from all walks of life in China do not want to immediately regard this news as reliable. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e7">British Concessions to Japan <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>In the Tokyo talks, Britain's concessions to Japan are something that the British authorities themselves can no longer deny. What cannot be known immediately is the extent of the concessions. Regarding what cannot be known, one might as well first make various assumptions of different degrees and deduce them separately. However, the unveiling is imminent, and rather than making many assumptions, it is better to wait for a moment and observe the facts. The facts shown cannot be concealed from the world's eyes and ears by anyone or any "rhetoric." For example, a certain British newspaper yesterday whitewashed its diplomatic ugliness, saying that neutrality is in line with national policy. This is deceiving one's conscience, deceiving others and deceiving the world, and even a three-year-old child would not be deceived by it. What is the benefit of deceiving?</p>
<p>Britain's international policy has long been distrusted by the world. Therefore, in the recent storms, world opinion has mostly encouraged Britain, but very few rely on Britain. This is evidenced by the fact that Britain recently pretended to be generous and wanted to provide security to the Northern and Western European countries, but the countries repeatedly thought it was impossible. This is because Britain's security is unreliable, and it only offends Germany and invites disaster. This is something that can be seen clearly without a change of heart in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Britain's concession to Japan has its military and economic near-term benefits, and even more so its long-term reasons of traditional national character. This is the internal reason for the concession. Furthermore, the Soviet Union's insistence on the Tripartite Pact, the result of the American Neutrality Act issue's testing of President Roosevelt's political prestige and power, and Germany's persistent pursuit of the Danzig Free City issue are the international reasons for the concession. These international reasons are likely to be Chamberlain's excuse for kowtowing to the outside world and deceiving those above and below at home, and clinging to power. At the same time, although it gives the American isolationists and the Soviet authorities an excuse to say that Chamberlain is not worth working with and that it is not worth caring about him, this is probably what Chamberlain does not care about. As for Germany, it will not show any scruples towards Britain because of the Anglo-Japanese compromise, but will prove Britain's baseness and become even more arrogant. Therefore, it can be inferred that the impact of Britain's concession to Japan is not limited to a corner of the Far East, but is extremely broad. The matter is not unexpected, and the past and future of the Tokyo talks are nothing more than a review of the Munich Conference. As for British Foreign Secretary Halifax's repeated statements that British foreign policy is not subject to memorandums, Chamberlain must think that he swears not to obey the memorandums, but only to willingly recite them. Repeatedly expressing that he can no longer endure humiliation, in the future, if he receives gentle comfort from Japan, he will no longer be blockaded.</p>
<p>Such statements are not to despise Britain; but despising or respecting Britain will hardly benefit or harm Britain. However, in terms of the matter, the concession is not a final decision, and there are many problems. Because the extent of Britain's concession cannot be known, but only in terms of the so-called neutrality of the concession, the nature of the concession and the meaning of neutrality are not something that Britain can decide unilaterally. Now Britain has made it change its nature. May I ask, does the League of Nations not have a resolution that member states must not weaken China's war of resistance and should provide as much assistance to China as possible? How will Britain explain itself to the League of Nations and its member states? This is the first point. The Nine-Power Treaty was once supported by Britain, and Britain even protested to Japan based on the treaty. How will Britain cover up its concessions now? This is the second point. Regarding matters under the jurisdiction of the Chinese National Government, will Britain's generous transfer and reorganization be legally effective? This is the third point. Regarding matters related to countries other than Britain and Japan, will other countries willingly martyr themselves for Chamberlain? This is the fourth point. These four points should not be narrowly regarded as arguments against Britain's concessions to Japan, but are also questions that Chamberlain, who presides over the concessions, should seek answers to.</p>
<p>British policy is dominated by the British, or at least by Chamberlain. Opposition from outsiders is probably in vain. Many outsiders have encouraged Britain, but there has been no effect. It is now warned again, but it is still useless. Not only that, but there are human emotions that cannot be restrained. No matter how trans-boundary and universally profound, those who cannot restrain their extreme indignation are only limited to extreme annoyance. What is the benefit of indignation and annoyance to the international situation? Or, they may not do so and imitate the "gentlemanly" demeanor, still being magnanimous and tolerant, and still using their inexhaustible thoughts to praise and pray, saying that Britain will definitely not let people down, and that Britain will probably not let me down. This is exactly what Britain wants, but what hope is there for Britain to change its course? Because of all this, even though Britain's attitude is like that, we still hope that all parties will restrain their about-to-be-released emotions and maintain calm reason. Based on one of the gains of our reason, what we regret most about Britain's attitude today is that the Far Eastern situation will become more chaotic and complex as a result. Britain has always been an important factor in stabilizing the Far East, but from now on it has abandoned its position as an important factor. Indeed, those who stabilize the Far East: (1) China confidently believes that it is linked to China's war of resistance and national construction, (2) Japan confidently believes that it is linked to Japan's victory and the creation of the so-called new order, (3) the international situation is determined by competition, ebb and flow. Those who have confidence are all 100%, and there is no so-called international interference in between. However, after two years of war, the strength of both sides has been greatly consumed, which is the most objective and accurate argument. Regardless of the quality of the consumption, or the support after the consumption, the deepening of international relations is more important than both sides, and penetrates the strict defense of both national groups and is more important than the two-way path of peace and war. This is also the most objective observation. Britain is a major town internationally, and has a position where it can do great things, but now its retrogression is tantamount to abandoning itself. Regarding Britain's perversion, what is the reaction of the National Government, we have not yet heard. However, what the National Government gained from Britain was greatest in the early stage of the war of resistance, and after the transportation lines of Hong Kong and Guangdong were cut off, the military transportation network was elsewhere, and the center of the nation moved westward again, and the relationship between the general national life and foreign exchange became more and more distant and sparse. Therefore, after the early stage of the war of resistance, the more recent it became, the less the National Government factually received assistance from Britain. Moreover, in the past year, Britain has especially exposed its stinginess in assisting China. Therefore, saying that the National Government will reduce its confidence due to Britain's perversion is something that no one would make such a view. As for Japan, Britain has already made concessions, and the claims of the military are again achieved by the moderates, and further success is gained from Britain. From now on, the Japanese moderates, who are cherished by Britain, will increasingly descend and become diplomatic technicians of the military, that is, the claims of the moderates are sacrificed by Britain and even disdained by the military. This, in terms of timing and strategy, actually gives the two-way path of peace and war a "subtle" adverse impact, and makes the Japanese military rejoice in its confidence. The confidence of both China and Japan is the basis for war and even the prolongation of war. Britain's regression reduces its importance in stabilizing the Far East and makes the international components gradually change its quality, inducing new trends of ebb and flow. Promoting this new trend, the transformation of Sino-British relations is an important psychological basis.</p>
<h3 id="e8">Result of the Fourth Tokyo Talks: Agreement Reached in Principle, Compromise Achieved. Tianjin Issue Roundtable Conference Held This Morning to Discuss Japanese Demands. Tokyo and London to Issue Joint Statement Tonight. <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is now learned that the Anglo-Japanese roundtable conference on the Tianjin issue will be held at 9:00 AM tomorrow at the Foreign Vice-Minister's residence. It is reported that the British representatives will be British Ambassador Craigie, British Consul Herbert of Tianjin, and British Military Attaché to Japan, Pickard. The Japanese representatives will be Counselor Kato of the Japanese Embassy in Changchun, Japanese Consul Tanaka of Tianjin, Major General Muto of the Japanese Army in North China, and Colonel Ota. "Miyako Shimbun" claims that the reason for Britain's concession to reach a compromise in Tokyo is the current difficulties faced by Britain and the Soviet Union, the cool attitude of the United States, and the increase in anti-British movements within China. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning's Asahi Shimbun published the full text of the so-called compromise reached between Japanese Foreign Minister Arita and British Ambassador Craigie, stating: "The British government recognizes the current state in China where large-scale warfare is in progress, and recognizes the necessity for actions by the Japanese military in China to be advantageous to the Japanese military, given the continued existence of this situation. The British government will abolish all actions and plans that may hinder the Japanese military from achieving the above-mentioned objectives, and will clearly announce this policy to British officials in China, causing them to acknowledge it." (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) At 0:15 AM this morning, an official Japanese announcement stated that Foreign Minister Arita and Ambassador Craigie held another round of talks at the Foreign Minister's residence last night from 11:05 PM to 11:50 PM. It is reported that the British side made significant concessions, and a compromise has been reached. Documents regarding the agreement will be released simultaneously in Tokyo and London tomorrow. (Haitong Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hiranuma visited the Emperor to report on the progress of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations and the agreement in principle on general issues. Afterwards, he met with reporters and stated that since an agreement in principle on general issues has been reached, negotiations on individual issues will be easier to commence. (Haitong Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Anglo-Japanese negotiations regarding the general principles underlying the Tianjin issue were formally concluded during the fourth meeting between Arita and Craigie on the evening of the 22nd. The governments of Britain and Japan will simultaneously issue a joint statement in Tokyo and London at 10:00 PM on the 24th (3:00 PM London time). (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Starting at 9:00 AM on the 24th, the first on-site negotiations will be held at the Foreign Vice-Minister's residence. The Japanese representatives will be Foreign Minister Arita, Ambassador Kato, Consul Tanaka, and Major General Muto. The British representatives will be Ambassador Craigie, Consul Herbert of Tianjin, and Major General Pickard. Foreign Minister Arita will also participate when necessary. In addition, administrative officials from both sides will attend for recording and liaison purposes. The conference may be changed to a roundtable format in the future. During the negotiations, the Japanese side will first present concrete demands for resolving the Tianjin issue, which will then be discussed item by item. From the Japanese perspective, the sincerity of Britain's understanding of the principles this time will be evidenced by the British response to the aforementioned concrete demands, so they will approach the meeting with a serious and watchful attitude, while fully implementing the reasonable demands they have put forward. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the Sunday Express stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain will clearly announce in the House of Commons that the British government will only agree to discuss some of the points raised by Japan during the talks. Apart from conducting talks, no concrete compromise has been reached on any issue. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today's Hochi Shimbun reported that the sole purpose of the Anglo-Japanese talks is to restore the British concession to its original state. All fundamental issues between Britain and Japan have not yet been resolved, and no mention has been made of restoring the British concession in Tianjin or any matters related to the future relationship of the British concession, which is regrettable. The preservation of British rights and interests in China may lead to serious future problems. Therefore, Japan should maintain an unyielding attitude in future roundtable conferences in order to resolve the overall situation. At the same time, Japanese Prime Minister Hiranuma met with newspaper reporters last night and admitted that the Japanese authorities have always held an approving attitude towards the anti-British movement in Japan. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the understanding reached on the principles of the Anglo-Japanese Tokyo talks, on-site negotiations will be held at the Foreign Vice-Minister's residence starting at 9:00 AM on the 24th. Japan will present concrete demands regarding the Tianjin issue for discussion. The Japanese representatives will include Minister Kato from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Consul Tanaka, Major General Muto from the Army, and Foreign Minister Arita, who may also attend when necessary. The British side will be represented by Ambassador Craigie, Consul Herbert stationed in Tianjin, and Major General Pickard, the military attaché of the British Embassy. (Domei, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Hiranuma Indicates Crisis Has Passed <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hiranuma released a statement to newspaper reporters, stating that the general issues that formed the background to the Tianjin situation have been resolved, and the crisis in the Anglo-Japanese negotiations has now passed. The basic principles obtained as a result of the resolution can be applied to all of China, not just Tianjin. As for British rights and interests in China, they can only be recognized if Britain acknowledges the relationship of mutual assistance and interdependence between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." He implied that Britain should not grant credit loans or other conveniences to China to aid the Chiang regime. If Britain continues to do so, its actions will be regarded as hostile to Japan. If Britain does not aid the Chiang regime, China will have no funds to purchase arms from foreign merchants. The basic measures agreed upon by Britain and Japan will not only be a blow to the Chongqing government, but will also be a good factor in resolving the China Incident. He hopes that the British government will take necessary steps to ensure that British authorities and the general British public in China understand the spirit of the new Anglo-Japanese accord. The Japanese government intends to suppress the anti-British movement within the country because this progress has been made in the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, so the anti-British movement contradicts government policy. As for the situation in Europe, the Japanese government has already formulated a basic policy and will continue to implement it, regardless of the outcome of the Tokyo talks. According to a communiqué from the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a compromise has been reached on the general issues that form the background to the Tianjin situation during the continued talks between Craigie and Arita yesterday. Documents regarding this matter will be released simultaneously in Tokyo and London on Monday. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Japan Employs Propaganda Tactics <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of the Observer stated that the claim that British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita have reached a compromise originated solely from the Japanese side. In addition, there have been similar Japanese criticisms that, although not explicitly stating that Britain has succumbed, imply that this compromise is based on Japanese terms and will disappoint China. Craigie's report has not yet been received. However, it goes without saying that if a compromise has been reached, it must not contradict the instructions issued by the British government for negotiating the matter. British Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons just last week that Britain is unwilling and unable to change its policies at the request of other countries. According to opinions in London, Chongqing should not be misled by Japanese reports, as this is crucial. Chamberlain will make a statement on the current situation in the House of Commons tomorrow (Monday). In the view of the general public, Japanese propaganda must be regarded as an ordinary performance of one of the latest diplomatic methods commonly used by Berlin and Tokyo, which focuses on the day of propaganda rather than the truth of the facts. At the same time, Japanese propaganda must also be seen as encouraging domestic sentiment not to acknowledge the truth of the facts to be announced by official circles in London and Tokyo tomorrow.

<h3 id="e11">British Newspapers Deny Concessions to Japan <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources declared last night that Britain intends to maintain extreme neutrality in the British concession in Tianjin and suppress all anti-Japanese activities within the concession. British authorities claim that Britain will recognize the existence of hostilities in China and the right of the Japanese army to act in self-defense. A British government spokesperson stated that this approach does not, in principle, involve British concessions to Japan. The Times commented that Britain must "recognize the ironclad facts of the situation in North China, including the overwhelming superiority of the Japanese army and the de facto occupation of its major cities." Neutral diplomats hinted that the British decision may indicate a change in British policy toward Japan. An editorial in the Star stated that Britain will recognize Japan's "responsibility for maintaining peace and order in North China." The initial talks between British Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita in Tokyo have concluded, and an announcement will be released simultaneously in London and Tokyo on Monday, outlining Britain's decision. British Prime Minister Chamberlain intends to announce Britain's decision to the House of Commons. This announcement will be released simultaneously in Tokyo. The Anglo-Japanese agreement serves as the basis for the start of Anglo-Japanese negotiations, with the aim of seeking a detailed resolution to the conflict between Britain and Japan in China. Britain guarantees to maintain the neutrality of the British concession in Tianjin, which is believed to be in line with British policy in China. According to observations by Far East experts in this area, the only danger hidden in British policy is that Japan may use the excuse that Britain is using Tianjin as a base to protect the Chinese currency system to violate the neutrality of the concession. Therefore, this issue will be raised for consideration in future negotiations between the British Ambassador to Japan and the Japanese Foreign Minister. This action shows that Japan wants to force British banks in Tianjin to hand over silver worth approximately 50 million yuan in legal tender belonging to the Chongqing government. Although officials today strongly denied that the British government is considering withdrawing its support for maintaining Chinese legal tender, it is generally believed that the government is giving it further consideration. At the British Cabinet meeting on Wednesday, a decision will be made to adopt one of the following two policies: one is to allow the Chinese currency system to change on its own, and the other is to add millions of pounds to the already depleted Exchange Equalization Fund to maintain Chinese legal tender. Officials here are under the impression that unless the United States agrees to help stabilize Chinese legal tender, Britain is unwilling to take further risks. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e12">China May Protest to Britain <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Once the details of the Anglo-Japanese compromise in Tokyo are announced, there will be a reaction of disappointment here. The Chinese government will likely instruct its ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, to inquire with the British government about the details of the Tokyo compromise. If the proposed measures conflict with the Nine-Power Treaty and resolutions of the League of Nations, a protest will be lodged with the British government. All sectors of Chinese society have long believed that Britain would not make concessions to Japan and regard the Anglo-Japanese compromise broadcast by Tokyo as propaganda. If this claim is indeed true, China will be greatly disappointed. In the public eye, the news of the Tokyo talks in recent days is even more important than war reports and currency news.

<h3 id="e13">French Newspapers Observe Negotiation Situation <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) After the representatives of Britain and Japan conducted negotiations in Tokyo, it is reported that a preliminary agreement has been reached. The newspapers here have recently commented on this. The right-wing L'Écho de Paris stated, "Although we should not be overly optimistic, it is also true that factors favorable to the future of negotiations already exist. It is reported that the German side has felt anxious upon learning of the news that Britain and Japan have reached a preliminary agreement. Some newspapers even assert that Japan can achieve the same results whether it cooperates with Britain or not. The implication is to advise Japan not to cooperate with Britain. This view is not entirely accurate, but it is only natural for Berlin to feel uneasy." The right-wing Le Journal stated, "Excessive optimism is not advisable. A moderate attitude is often mistaken for weakness. This can be seen from the communiqué issued by the Japanese cabinet yesterday, which was triumphant, as if celebrating a victory. However, the tone of this communiqué is probably intended to satisfy the military and to give the impression that the proponents of realism and moderation have won. In other countries, for two years, they have already allowed the actual situation to develop, thereby facilitating Japan. Now, they will naturally have to take this situation into consideration. At the same time, Japan should make sincere concessions to Britain and strive to avoid disputes, lest the Soviet Union benefit from them." (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The military preparations being made in "Manchukuo" were recently revealed by the Far Eastern Red Army organ "Red Banner," which stated that "Manchukuo" has become a base for attacking the Soviet Union. In terms of air force, by the beginning of this year, Japan had concentrated over 500 military aircraft and 50 to 70 transport aircraft in the "country," and built over 140 airfields, capable of accommodating 2,000 to 2,500 aircraft. Furthermore, the construction of airfields northwest of the Khalkha River at Boli and Baojun (phonetic transliterations of two locations) is nearing completion, which is sufficient to pose a direct threat to the Soviet Maritime Province. There are a total of two main air force bases, one in Xinchang (phonetic transliteration), with 20 steel and concrete hangars, each capable of housing 20 aircraft, and the other in Harbin, with 15 hangars, some of which are located underground. In terms of ground forces, the "Manchukuo" army has 90,000 infantrymen, commanded by 10,000 Japanese officers. It is reported that the Kwantung Army Headquarters intends to reorganize it. In addition, there are 15,000 White Russian troops under Japanese command. As for transportation, Japan is actively constructing railways and highways, with particular emphasis on areas adjacent to the Soviet Union. In total, from 1932 to 1938, 5,000 kilometers of railway were built, reaching Longhua in Rehe to the west and Mudanjiang and Mishan in Jilin Province to the east. 17,000 kilometers of military roads have also been built, with the main roads being 8 to 12 meters wide, capable of accommodating heavy artillery and tanks.

<h3 id="e15">One Battalion of Japanese Troops Invading Mongolia Completely Annihilated. Soviet-Mongolian Forces Retain Original Positions. Air Combat Occurs East of Lake Buir. Fourteen Japanese Aircraft Shot Down. <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The General Command of the Mongolian People's Republic and the Soviet Armed Forces recently issued a communiqué stating that between July 12th and 20th, Japanese-Manchukuo forces in the Lake Buir region showed no specific activity, only intermittently bombarding the positions of Soviet-Mongolian forces east of the Khalkhyn Gol with artillery and machine guns. However, on the night of July 12th, one battalion of Japanese infantry, supported by artillery, attempted to break through the Soviet-Mongolian line southwest of Nomonhan and Bulderbo. They were surrounded by Soviet-Mongolian forces and completely annihilated. Afterwards, over a hundred Japanese corpses, four 3-inch artillery pieces, eight anti-tank guns, 500 artillery shells, five heavy machine guns, and countless other military supplies were abandoned on the battlefield, all of which were seized by Soviet-Mongolian forces. Soviet-Mongolian losses were light.</p>
<p>On July 21st and 22nd, Japanese-Manchukuo forces repeatedly launched attacks on Soviet-Mongolian forces in an attempt to break through, but were repelled. To date, Soviet-Mongolian forces continue to secure the area east of the Khalkhyn Gol. From July 12th to 20th, the Japanese air force only conducted reconnaissance flights. However, on July 16th, 50 Japanese fighter planes appeared in the air. Soviet-Mongolian aircraft detected them and took off to engage them, whereupon the Japanese planes retreated without a fight. On July 21st, 120 Japanese fighter planes, mobilized from various parts of Manchuria, again launched a large-scale invasion of Mongolian territory east and southeast of Lake Buir. One hundred Soviet-Mongolian fighter planes took off to intercept them. Air combat ensued over Mongolian territory for an hour. The Japanese planes were finally chased into "Manchukuo" by Soviet-Mongolian aircraft. As a result of the air combat, fourteen Japanese planes were shot down, and two Japanese pilots were captured alive. The Soviet-Mongolian side only lost three planes.</p>
<p>Regarding the claim by the Japanese Kwantung Army that Soviet-Mongolian aircraft bombed Fularji near Qiqihar, the Soviet-Mongolian Command declared that this was a malicious fabrication. (TASS, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese military news from Changchun, fighting continues on the Manchurian-Mongolian border. Soviet-Mongolian artillery bombarded Japanese-Manchukuo forces continuously from morning to night yesterday. Japanese-Manchukuo forces are currently preparing to move out. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Oil Mine Dispute Between Japan and Soviet Union on Sakhalin Island. Japanese Negotiations Fail. Oil Extraction Work Remains Suspended. <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) Due to a violation of its contract with the Soviet trade union, a certain Japanese oil company on Sakhalin Island was fined 374,000 rubles by the island's primary court. Subsequently, the company appealed to the Alexandria Foch Kirk City Higher Court, and lost again. The court also ordered the company to pay the fine in full by the 19th of this month, otherwise its assets would be seized. The Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tōgō Shigenori, protested to the Soviet government, requesting an extension and setting a deadline for a reply by the 18th. The Soviet government considered this request to be a "last-minute plea" and refused to accept it. This was the situation a few days ago. According to sources from the Japanese Embassy here, the Soviet authorities have not yet implemented the asset seizure. It is unclear whether they have abandoned the idea altogether or have merely postponed the date. However, the Japanese side views the seizure as not only harming Japanese interests (Japan extracts 150,000 tons of oil annually from Sakhalin Island), but also because the oil concession was compensation for the massacre of 700 Japanese residents in Nikolaevsk in 1924. If a seizure were to be carried out, Japanese public opinion would certainly be extremely outraged, leading to a very serious situation. The Soviet authorities should therefore act with caution. At this moment, Soviet authorities are continuing negotiations with representatives of the Japanese company, which are progressing very slowly. The Soviet workers employed by the company remain on strike, causing work to be completely suspended. Due to the climate on the island, the working season lasts from May or June to September each year. It is doubtful whether work can resume this year. (Havas, 22nd)</p>

<p>(Hague) Former Prime Minister Colijn has been instructed to form a cabinet and has now completed the task.

<h3 id="e18">Bishop Yu Bin Receives Warm Welcome in Chicago. Leaders From All Walks of Life Greet Him at the Station. Bishop Very Busy with Lectures Everywhere. <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Chicago Correspondence: Bishop Yu Bin has been warmly welcomed in the United States, and the details have been reported in previous issues. On June 28th, Yu arrived here from Washington D.C. Several dozens of representatives of overseas Chinese and Western organizations, including the Archbishop of Chicago, Cardinal Stritch, and Bishop Sheil, were also waiting at the station to greet him. Cardinal Stritch, nearly eighty years old, was at the station waiting for a long time, showing great hospitality. Those who came with Yu included Father Li Guanghui and Dr. Pan Chaoying. After arriving at the station, Fang Fuxing from the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, as well as Hu Chibao, Yu Caoli, and Yu Yuehe, chairmen of the Anti-Japanese Association, introduced Yu and others to the local Chinese and Western figures, shaking hands with each of them. Then, they took a car to Chinatown, escorted along the way by local police on motorcycles. At the Chinatown welcome rally, the chairman, Fang Fuxing, gave a speech first, welcoming the significance of Bishop Yu's visit, and decided to invite Cardinal Stritch and Bishop Sheil to give speeches. Afterwards, Yu Aili, representing the overseas Chinese, gave a speech in English, thanking the guests, and decided to invite Yu to give a lecture. After the meeting, the Anti-Japanese Association held a tea party and invited Yu to visit Mayor Burton at the City Hall, along with the local bishops and staff of the Anti-Japanese Association. Mayor Burton presented Bishop Yu with the golden key to the city, explaining its significance, and opened the city gates to welcome Bishop Yu, showing his sympathy for China. That evening at 7:00 PM, a public banquet was held for Bishop Yu at the Carter Hotel. Leaders from all walks of life arrived in droves, reaching over 300 people. The atmosphere was extremely friendly towards China. First, the chairman of the banquet, Ms. Yu Aili, gave a welcome speech, deciding to invite Cardinal Stritch to give a speech. In fact, Cardinal Stritch is the only American Catholic bishop who has publicly condemned Japan, as this has never happened before. Although the American bishops in the past were sympathetic to China, they never publicly rejected Japan due to their position. Now, Cardinal Stritch has publicly announced Japan's atrocities, saying that anyone with a conscience cannot agree with Japan's atrocities in China. Finally, he said that Yu Bin was born in Heilongjiang, so he firmly believes that the "Manchukuo" puppet organization will soon become a historical relic, and Bishop Yu can return to his "old home" with glory. He concluded by declaring that he is willing to assist in everything that is beneficial to China within the diocese. Afterwards, Mayor Burton of Chicago, Bishop Sheil, the clergyman of the Holy Trinity Church, Hugh A. Morrison, the leader of the Jewish Church, G. George Fox, and the General Secretary of the Chicago Christian Association, Leslie G. Watson, gave speeches one after another. Then, Yu was invited to give a lecture, mainly about (1) the tragic sacrifices of Chinese civilians and the plight of refugees since the War of Resistance against Japan, (2) Japan's use of "communism" and "red scare" as an excuse to alienate China from its friendship with Europe and the United States, and the fact that the Chinese family system makes it impossible for China to become a communist country, so foreign friends can rest assured, (3) China's resistance against Japan is not only fighting hard for its independent survival, but also fighting for justice and peace, and Japan's actions in China today are destroying the interests of Europe and the United States in the Far East, (4) the Chinese government and people express their gratitude for the sympathy and assistance of the United States, (5) 90 percent of the American people are sympathetic to China, but unfortunately a small number of selfish arms merchants and industrialists continue to sell arms to Japan, which is regrettable. However, many Americans are now gradually becoming aware of this "aiding and abetting evil" behavior, and the US government should find ways to stop it. If this measure is successful, Japan will stop its atrocities in China within two months, which will not only eliminate the scourge of war in the Far East, but also maintain international peace and justice. After the meeting, Westerners crowded to ask Yu to sign autographs, and those who obtained an autograph gave US$1 each. The enthusiasm of Westerners in welcoming Bishop Yu that evening was quite commendable. At 10:00 AM the next morning, Yu held a memorial service for the fallen soldiers and deceased compatriots of China in St. Paul's Cathedral. Hundreds of Chinese and Western people attended. The enthusiasm of the Chinese people in coming to the cathedral was rare. In the afternoon, Yu and leaders of the overseas Chinese community took a car carrying flowers to pay their respects at the tombs of former US President Garfield and US Secretary of State John Hay, who first advocated the Open Door Policy in China. Yu only stayed in Chicago for two days, and was very busy with lectures. Chinese and Western people had a very good impression of him, and specially invited Yu to return to Chicago for another visit in September.</p>

<h3 id="e19">Summer Health Problems <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Now sunny, now cloudy, now cold, now hot!</p>
<p>A little carelessness, and illness strikes!</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been changing erratically, from sunny to cloudy, cold to hot, causing internal secretion functions in weakened bodies to become disordered. Natural resistance disappears, making one susceptible to disease. At any time and in any place, there is a risk of contracting typhoid fever, colds, scarlet fever, diphtheria, epidemics, dysentery, malaria, and other diseases. Latent illnesses also have a chance to flare up. Once health is lost, life is constantly in danger of being cut short. The fundamental solution is to regularly take German "Shou Er Kang," transforming a weakened body into a strong one, thereby maintaining health and preventing future infections.</p>
<p>German "Shou Er Kang" is made by scientifically replicating internal secretion hormones (Hormone) extracted from animal bodies, along with various mineral and plant tonic ingredients. After taking it, it can directly correct the body's internal secretion function, promote the production of new blood and essence, replenish internal organ nutrition, and enhance natural resistance to resist external disease invasion, permanently maintaining health and transforming a weakened body into a strong one. It is truly the most suitable tonic for summer!</p>

<p>Warsaw. Former Polish Prime Minister, the world-renowned pianist Paderewski, has pledged to contribute ten pounds monthly to purchase Polish national defense bonds until Poland is out of danger. He also published a letter in a conservative newspaper, urging Poles to remember that the danger from Germany has not passed, stating, "The stance of Western democratic countries like England and France has removed the immediate danger of war, but we must not think that the danger has passed. In fact, the crisis still exists, and we do not know when it will recur. The German press points out that Poles only have superficial patriotism and lack sustained spirit. Only those who fully recognize moral values will achieve victory. I believe victory will belong to those who defend themselves against the enemy. Although Poland is poor, it must do everything possible to maintain its fighting power. Currently, all Poles are doing their best to help the country resist the oppression of the enemy and massively subscribe to national defense bonds. I now suggest that we not only decide to buy these bonds once, but also buy them monthly. I myself will contribute ten pounds monthly until Poland is out of danger," (Reuters, 23rd).</p>

<h3 id="e22">Chamberlain Plans to Implement New Appeasement Plan for Europe; German Economic Expert Interrogated in London; Rumors Abound of Connection <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>(London) It is widely believed that British Prime Minister Chamberlain is planning to launch a new appeasement movement in Europe to save the world from war. This appeasement program will likely be backed by the new British army, which will greatly strengthen Chamberlain's diplomacy with the Berlin-Rome Axis. Conservative leaders point out that with the British general election approaching in the autumn, a peace movement is imminent. If Chamberlain can peacefully resolve the Danzig crisis and reach an understanding with Germany diplomatically, he can secure victory in the autumn election.</p>
<p>Diplomatic circles here are surprised that the British government denies having any formal connection with the peace movement of Dr. Walter, a German economic expert currently visiting London. However, the source of this news is very reliable. Some believe that the government denies it because the proposed appeasement plan is not yet in a definite form. However, it seems that there have been discussions with Walter on general issues of appeasement. After the initial negotiations with Walter, a contract will be concluded between England and Germany, whereby the political, economic, and financial relations of England with German protectorates such as Bohemia, Moravia, etc., will be re-regulated.</p>
<p>The speech given yesterday by Overseas Trade Minister Hudson has attracted widespread attention because Hudson's remarks are related to Walter's peace talks. Hudson said that if we clearly proclaim to the world that we will not give up our leadership, war can be avoided. He also said that regardless of whether war occurs, the current problem facing the world is whether to devote its energy to military industries or peaceful industries. The difference is that it is more difficult in wartime because war will inevitably lead to the destruction of a large amount of capital.</p>
<p>He further pointed out that there are still plenty of undeveloped areas in the world to attract people and industries. We must recognize that all healthy people are useful people. We should avoid war, but at the same time, we should point out that our country cannot make concessions for nothing. We are willing to tell the world of our willingness to cooperate. If we pursue this policy, the whole world will believe that we have confidence in our own strength and will be able to act accordingly.</p>
<p>Due to foreign rumors about peace talks, the British and German governments have jointly issued a denial statement. The French believe that these rumors are nothing more than Nazi propaganda, intended to create doubts between England, Germany, and Poland, thereby undermining the strength of the peace front. A British government spokesperson said that all cabinet members, including Chamberlain, are unaware of the so-called peace plan (Associated Press, 23rd).</p>
<h3 id="e23">London and Berlin Simultaneously Declare Walter Not on Special Mission <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>London. German Economic Minister Walter recently came to London to participate in the International Whaling Conference. It is reported that during Walter's stay here, he met with several officials, but the discussions were private matters. However, newspapers reported that the talks were related to a military reduction plan, stating that England was willing to lend Germany a loan of 1 billion marks to help it shift from arms manufacturing to peaceful commodities. Both London and Berlin have firmly denied this. London officials dismissed the rumor as absurd, and Germany sent a semi-official document to Berlin newspapers, stating that Dr. Walter recently returned to Berlin after participating in discussions on whaling issues in London and issues related to the Evian Refugee Conference. It is reported that broad agreement has been reached on discussions regarding immigration and refugee issues (Reuters, 23rd).</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German government last night denied that the British government had informally discussed a peace plan with German economic expert Dr. Walter during his visit to England. The statement declared that Dr. Walter went to England as a representative to the World Whale Conference and would return to Berlin after completing his mission. The statement denied that British officials had discussed a British plan with Dr. Walter, with Britain providing Germany with loans as an exchange condition for limiting armaments (Associated Press, 23rd).</p>
<h3 id="e24">UK Considering Financial Aid to Germany Is Only a Private Opinion <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(London) Rumors are circulating that certain British cabinet members advocate providing financial and economic assistance to Germany, provided that the country's economic structure returns to a peacetime state. Diplomatic circles here have denied this, stating that the Foreign Office or any cabinet members are unaware of this and have not even discussed it. Certain important figures may have discussed or considered this plan, but only in their private capacity and not commissioned by any cabinet members (Havas, 22nd).</p>
<p>(London) Authorities here have declared that various large-scale plans that advocate providing Germany with economic convenience to solve the problems it has caused are likely to fail, at least for the time being. A Foreign Office spokesman solemnly stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax had not considered this. Overseas Trade Minister Hudson and government industry advisor Sir Wilson recently held talks with Dr. Walter, an advisor to the German Ministry of Economic Affairs, but these were only private talks. British foreign policy is solely determined by the cabinet. Although some who advocate for a "solution" are close to the government, they do not represent the cabinet's views. Even regarding the issue of the Free City of Danzig, the British government's attitude remains extremely firm. The issue was not discussed during Walter's talks with Overseas Trade Minister Hudson and government industry advisor Wilson. Regarding the remarks made yesterday in Berlin by a Nazi Party spokesman that Europe should be calm in the coming months, authorities here are deeply skeptical because Germany has repeatedly declared that Danzig must be annexed by Germany. Therefore, the attitude of close attention and the determination to prevent German interference of all related countries must not be neglected (Havas, 22nd).</p>
<h3 id="e25">Based on New British Instructions, Three Countries Continue Negotiations; Germany and Soviet Union Promote Trade Relations; Berlin Negotiations in Progress <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) The negotiations between the three countries of England, France, and the Soviet Union are scheduled to be held this afternoon at the Kremlin Palace. It is expected that the events to be discussed at that time will be based on the final instructions sent by the British and French governments to their representatives in Moscow on July 21 (Reuters, 23rd).</p>
<p>(London) Political figures here have expressed their views on the Anglo-Japanese negotiations and the negotiations between the three countries of England, France, and the Soviet Union, stating that after the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo gradually improved, the state of confrontation between England and Japan has eased. As a result, the Soviet government's attitude when negotiating with England and France may be more conciliatory. The difficulty currently encountered in the negotiations between the three countries of England, France, and the Soviet Union is still the question of how to define "indirect aggression." Regarding this, any definition that can be considered interference in the internal affairs of other countries is unacceptable to both England and France. Instead, they should propose to the Soviet Union that whenever there is a threat similar to the Czech events of last September, in other words, when a country is threatened by foreign pressure and is annexed without war, the three countries of England, France, and the Soviet Union should exchange views. If this compromise plan still cannot be established, then the three countries of England, France, and the Soviet Union should sign an alliance treaty that does not involve any other country. Soviet figures in London said that the country must then find ways to separately conclude mutual assistance agreements with Poland and Turkey to supplement this alliance treaty. In addition, a message has been released that the opinions of England and France have not been consistent. Responsible persons here firmly deny this and say that the views of the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, and the French Ambassador, Nagear, are completely consistent, which is clear evidence of the close relationship between the two governments (Havas, 22nd).</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government yesterday decisively published an official report on Soviet-German business negotiations, but the newspapers here did not comment on it. Well-informed sources confirmed that the negotiations have been going on for a long time and said that the purpose of the negotiations is to discuss promoting Soviet-German trade relations. The issue of Germany lending the Soviet Union a credit loan of 200,000,000 marks is also one of the topics of discussion (Haitong, 23rd).</p>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the resumption of business negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union, those in the German embassy here have stated that this was only learned from the semi-official communiqué issued by the Soviet Union. Rumors that the German ambassador Schulenburg had been summoned back to Italy (above) and the Polish (below) Air Force nations are not true. German figures said that these negotiations must be reopened after the negotiations between the three countries of England, France, and the Soviet Union are concluded. The business negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union were initiated by the German government in early 1938. At that time, Germany was willing to lend the Soviet Union a second batch of credit loans of 200 million marks (the first batch of credit loans of 200 million marks was lent to the Soviet Union several years ago and has been used up). However, the Soviet Union was unable to satisfy the conditions put forward by Germany, and it was abandoned. At the end of 1938, the German side brought up the old matter again and was willing to make concessions. Extending to the beginning of 1939, that is, when German and Polish representatives were negotiating a business agreement in Warsaw, there were rumors that the German business delegation, led by Schnurre, a specialist in the trade department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, would go to Moscow in the near future. After this news spread, all countries paid attention. At that time, Schnurre had also arrived in Warsaw and had planned to go to Moscow, but had to turn back halfway. Later, the German government appointed the German ambassador to the Soviet Union, Schulenburg, to preside over the negotiations, but they were suspended due to differences in views between the two sides and have remained so until now (Havas, 23rd).</p>

<p>(London) According to the London "Star," Pope Pius XII and Mussolini are now attempting to resolve the Danzig crisis by peaceful means. It is reported that the Pope has made a proposal to Germany and Italy, advocating that Danzig maintain its current status for five years. After five years, the European crisis may ease slightly, and the Danzig issue may therefore be resolved peacefully. Mussolini has conveyed the Pope's views to Hitler. The newspaper said, "Italy will not hesitate to make any sacrifices to maintain peace" (Associated Press, 23rd).</p>
<p>Vatican City. Regarding the reports in British newspapers that Pope Pius XII is now cooperating with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and is working to mediate the issue of the City of Danzig based on the principle of maintaining the current status of Danzig, authoritative sources here have denied this, saying it does not conform to the facts (Haitong, 23rd).</p>
<p>(Berlin) After Hitler annexed Bohemia and Moravia on April 1, he declared that this year's Nazi Party Congress would be a "Peace Congress." Up to this point, this name has not been mentioned. At the same time, Germany is actively conducting propaganda at home and abroad on the issue of the Free City of Danzig, strongly stating that the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor will be unconditionally returned to Germany. There is no so-called compromise plan, and there is no need to resort to war. Rumors that Germany may accept a compromise plan and negotiate with Poland, and that the British side intends to demand that Germany reduce its armaments and is willing to provide credit loans and redistribute various raw materials as exchange conditions, have all been denied by the German authorities. Foreign observers here commented that the German government's words may not be sincere. German political figures have very different views on how the European situation will evolve in the future (Havas, 22nd).</p>

<p>Danzig. With the harvest season approaching, Danzig is facing a severe labor shortage. The authorities may draft women to fill this gap. Currently, 5,000 men are serving in special police duties, and all able-bodied men are being used to build border fortifications. The plan to use female workers was formulated three months ago and can now be implemented if necessary (Reuters, 23rd).</p>
<p>Warsaw. Poland and the Free City of Danzig had several new incidents today. (1) Ten Polish university students accidentally entered the territory of the Free City of Danzig and were immediately arrested. They will be interrogated by a summary court on the 24th of this month. (2) A Polish railway worker was arrested for carrying two types of Polish newspapers banned by the Free City of Danzig. Another Polish railway worker was sentenced to five months of detention for shouting loudly during a parade by the Nazi Youth League (Havas, 22nd).</p>

<p>Singapore. Although British cement is more than twice as expensive as Japanese cement, the Singapore Municipal Council is willing to spend more than 7,000 pounds more every six months to purchase British goods instead of Japanese goods. The proposal to purchase British cement was put forward by a Chinese committee member and unanimously supported by other Chinese committee members. The case was passed. There were only three opponents among the committee members, all of whom were British Europeans. When proposing the motion, a Chinese committee member stated that a purely profit-driven mentality that ignores everything else is deplorable, and the committee should not have this mentality. Supporters spoke in favor, saying that Singapore is a stronghold of the British Empire and should not allow the local public to fund the realization of the "New Order in East Asia" because some committee members lack the courage to encourage local citizens to purchase British goods (Reuters, 23rd).</p>
<h3 id="e30">Spanish General Brews Coup; Franco Preempts; Triano Dismissed <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) According to reliable sources, there is a conspiracy within Spain that has been brewing for a long time. The government, in order to prevent problems, has re-enlisted retired army officers. Newspapers today published an order from the Ministry of Interior stating that civilian public gatherings are not allowed without official permission. In addition, regarding the reasons for the dismissal of General Triano, commander of the country's Second Military Region, it is reported that on the 18th of this month, the third anniversary of the Civil War, during a speech in Seville, although he did not directly attack General Franco, it constituted rebellious behavior. He said, "Soldiers who have worked hard and made great contributions should hold political power, while politicians who previously stood by should be kept out. The current administrative system in our country is unfair and should be corrected. The reason why there is no shortage of bread in the country is because I ordered the people to plant wheat in Andalusia. It is regrettable that military commanders in other regions do not ask about such big problems." (It is reported that Spanish generals have formed factions, with General Triano as their leader, and strongly oppose General Franco's proposal to establish a civilian government. After learning of this, General Franco issued an order on the 21st of this month dismissing him from his duties (Havas, 22nd).</p>
<p>(Paris) According to well-informed sources here, General Yagüe, commander of the Spanish Foreign Legion, was arrested in Madrid on the 20th of this month. It is reported that this matter is related to the dismissal of General Triano, commander of the Second Military Region. General Yagüe's treatment of people has always been extremely meticulous. Among the military leaders in Spain, he is most loved by the people. During the Civil War, he was repeatedly arrested for participating in various political activities, but was soon released. In addition, according to reliable sources, after being dismissed, General Triano was summoned to Burgos yesterday by General Franco, and then hurriedly traveled by car towards the French border. As of now, he has not reached his destination (Havas, 23rd).</p>

<h3 id="e31">The Chinese Nation Unites in Sincerity: Genghis Khan's Mausoleum Moves to Gansu; Grand Memorial Ceremony in Xi'an <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Xi'an on June 11th: After the Mongol and Han dignitaries attended the public memorial ceremony at Ejin Horo Banner, the coffin of Emperor Taizu of Yuan began its journey south. The temporary headquarters specially dispatched four large automobiles to transport the coffin. On the 15th, they arrived in Yulin; on the 24th, they reached Xianyang. Along the way, government and military institutions and civilian organizations all piously held public memorial ceremonies and receptions. Many people from distant places rode horses to the county towns to pay their respects to Genghis Khan's coffin. In Xi'an, there was a grand and enthusiastic reception, creating a rare grand event in the Northwest in recent years. This fully demonstrates the sincere unity between all ethnic groups of China.</p>
<p>Xi'an Receives the Coffin: On the evening of June 25th, Genghis Khan's coffin arrived in the western suburbs of Xi'an. All military and government institutions and civilian organizations in Xi'an formed a procession to greet it five li outside the city. The band played solemn and stirring music as the hearse entered the welcoming ranks. First, the highest military and political official of Shaanxi, Jiang Dingwen, led all the welcoming representatives in holding a welcoming ceremony. Then, it slowly proceeded toward the city of Xi'an. The band, honor guard, monks and priests, soldiers, and security teams led the way. Welcoming organizations lined up on the right side of the road. After the hearse approached and they paid their respects, they all followed behind the hearse, forming a long, snake-like welcoming procession that marched grandly toward Xi'an. The first car carried the "Divine Spear". In the center of the car was a metal "Divine Spear Temple", surrounded by four "Darhads" holding red, triangular flags with black borders. The lamas guarding the coffin and the Divine Spear of Genghis Khan stood tall at the rear, supported by two Darhads, watching the surroundings vigilantly. The second car was a large covered automobile with the Kuomintang flag and national flag crossed in front. In the middle hung a portrait of Genghis Khan. The car cover was draped with yellow satin, adorned with red satin rosettes. The inside of the car was fully covered with red satin brocade cushions. The silver coffins of Genghis Khan and his Third Consort were inside this car. Each silver coffin was wrapped in yellow satin. A large oil painting of Genghis Khan, facing sideways, extremely heroic and lifelike, was hung close to the silver coffin. Two rows of Darhad knights flanked both sides of the hearse to guard it. In addition, there were two other cars in the rear carrying the artifacts for the relocation and for the Darhads to ride in. In this way, a coffin procession was formed. As soon as the hearse entered the earthen city of Xiguan, deafening firecrackers exploded. Shops and households along the road had prepared incense tables and offerings, filled with crowds of people looking up at the coffin. Passing through the Xiguan Quan Street, which was overseen by the local head, it entered the Anding Gate of the brick city. The sound of firecrackers was even louder, echoing through the clouds. The incense tables set up by the shops were lined up one after another. The smoke of incense, the flickering of candlelight, and the sound of firecrackers intertwined to form a solemn welcoming melody. The crowds of people looking up at the coffin made the sidewalks on both sides so crowded that no water could pass through. The wide streets were swept very clean, allowing only the procession of the coffin and the welcoming people to pass. The national flag and gauze lanterns illuminated people's faces. The Mongol compatriots' hearts were filled with fervent respect and excitement, feeling extremely honored.</p>
<p>The silver coffin and the Divine Spear were erected in the Clock Tower in the city center, which served as the grand hall for the public memorial ceremony. High memorial arches were erected around the Clock Tower, fully decorated with plain colors. Two rows of plain lanterns hung inside each of the four archways. Elegiac couplets and sacrificial banners were hung on the walls. A memorial platform was set up in the middle, with a portrait of Genghis Khan hanging in front of it. A yellow silk banner with the words "Majesty Spreads Across East Asia" was placed horizontally as a backdrop, donated by Zhu Qinglan. In front of it was an offering table, and various wreaths were piled up beneath the platform. The memorial hall was filled with a solemn atmosphere. The coffin passed through the five-li-long West Main Street and arrived at the Clock Tower Grand Hall. First, the Divine Spear was erected in front of the memorial platform. Genghis Khan's silver coffin was placed in the center of the memorial platform, with the Third Consort's silver coffin on the left and the Divine Spear Temple on the right. The Mongolians call the Divine Spear "Surding," which means the banner of the commander. The spear was more than two zhang long (approximately 6.6 meters), and a thick wooden pole was attached to it. The wooden pole was more than one zhang and eight chi long (approximately 5.9 meters) and was strung with a painted banner. A circle of brown horsehair with a diameter of one chi (approximately 0.33 meters) surrounded the joint between the wooden pole and the spear. The top was the iron spear used by Genghis Khan during his conquests. Genghis Khan's silver coffin resembled an old-fashioned large trunk, more than three chi high (approximately 1 meter) and four or five chi long (approximately 1.3-1.6 meters), with a lid that could be opened. It was made of solid wood and covered with silver sheets. Exquisite patterns were carved on the silver sheets. A golden circular pattern of a hawk was inlaid in the front, extremely solemn and magnificent. The silver coffin of Genghis Khan's Third Consort was roughly the same as Genghis Khan's silver coffin, but less than three chi high and only four chi long, slightly smaller than Genghis Khan's silver coffin. The Temple of the Spear was a metal temple, four chi high, with doors. The Divine Spear was usually placed inside the temple, and it was only placed in front of the altar during major ceremonies. The Mongolians bowed when they saw the spear, with utmost respect. Before the public memorial ceremony, the Darhads knelt on the ground, chanting scriptures praising Genghis Khan's great achievements and requesting the Divine Spear's blessings.</p>
<p>They will arrive in Gansu late at night. Jiang Dingwen hosted a banquet in the main hall of the Provincial Government Building to entertain the special commissioner escorting the coffin and the Darhads. Many Hui and Tibetan compatriots were also present. The spirit of sincere unity among the five ethnic groups was evident on everyone's faces. Chairman Jiang Dingwen earnestly delivered a speech, "The motherland is in danger, and every Chinese compatriot has a responsibility." After Jiang's speech, the Mongol, Hui, and Tibetan compatriots all applauded and stood up to pay their respects, expressing their extreme approval. According to the special commissioner escorting the coffin, "The coffin will arrive at Xinglong Mountain in Yuzhong, Gansu, in a few months. All the Mongolians escorting the coffin will also travel there."</p>
<h3 id="e32">Maritime Traffic Off Quanzhou Blocked; Gulangyu Island Faces Water Shortage; Japanese Side Sets Conditions for Exports to Shantou <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Gulangyu dated July 14th, reported in the "North-China Daily News," stated: The Anqing ship has just arrived from Quanzhou, carrying two hundred passengers who departed from Manila. However, it waited off Quanzhou for eleven days for passengers to disembark, and only ten passengers were brought to Gulangyu Island. Hundreds and thousands of people are residing in inns in that city, waiting to leave. Boarding the ship is a dangerous matter. Only ten people dared to risk it and boarded and disembarked the ship, and can only do so in the darkest hours of the night. Those who venture out can never know when they will encounter Japanese patrol boats. These patrol boats have a bad habit of indiscriminately firing machine guns at anything that moves before questioning. Passengers arriving from Amoy recounted that a small island outside the Quanzhou area had been occupied by the Japanese military. The island has been deserted and uninhabited since time immemorial. Japanese naval forces landed on this island and used it as a base to seize all passing sailing ships. Whether fishing boats or merchant ships, all were seized and taken to the island, and the boatmen were invariably shot and thrown into the sea. When the Anqing ship was anchored off the coast of that area, crew members said they had seen eighteen such ships seized and taken to the island, converted into Japanese coastal patrol boats by Japanese sailors. Despite these dangerous conditions, ships continued their daily trade, carrying goods to sell alongside the Anqing ship, stopping only when the ship said it needed nothing more. Sometimes, stolen Chinese sailing ships were recovered. One very dark night, a small boat quietly approached the island. The people in the boat boarded a sailing ship that had been stolen that morning and sailed away, carrying twenty-five bags of rice. As Quanzhou is not a rice-producing area, rice is scarce. That night, another sailing ship carrying pigs was also recovered. However, the third attempt was unsuccessful, as the Japanese soldiers were lying in wait. Two people were killed by machine-gun fire, and one jumped into the sea and disappeared. Only two people survived. The Anqing ship brought twenty thousand bundles of firewood from Manila to aid the International Relief Committee. The firewood was in dire need, so it was quickly sold out at a price of 25 cents per bundle, even though it only weighed a few catties. The customs duty was as high as 1,050 yuan. The Gulangyu Municipal Council, which manages the sale of firewood, does its best to ensure that the firewood is distributed and sold fairly among people of all nationalities. Now Gulangyu Island has no water. The Japanese naval authorities in Amoy have decided to show the extent to which Gulangyu depends on Amoy, saying that the motorboat is currently under repair and cannot deliver water. However, according to the engineer managing the motorboat, this is just an excuse, and the motorboat is not damaged at all. The Japanese naval authorities and the petroleum company of Songyu Peninsula have just agreed last week that the water factory's ship should supply water. Since April, the water supply to the European residents of Songyu has been cut off. They used to transport water to Amoy by boat, but this source has suddenly ended and has not been restored. The Japanese side insists that the water boat must meet three conditions before it can continue to supply water: (1) The Japanese flag on the water boat must not be damaged; (2) The commander of the Chinese 75th Division in Songyu must guarantee that it will not interfere with the water boat, or the water boat must be escorted by a British naval motorboat; (3) The petroleum company bears full responsibility for the detention or damage of the water boat, as well as any loss of life that may occur. Currently, these three points may not be negotiated, as the Japanese side is now taking direct measures against Gulangyu Island. If this attitude continues unabated, then boats must be used to obtain drinking water from the mainland under escort. For the convenience of the Third Group people residing in Shantou, the Japanese side will allow one ship from each country to enter the port of Shantou once a week to unload cargo and disembark and embark passengers, subject to various conditions. However, the Japanese authorities may temporarily prohibit ships from entering if they deem it necessary.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Fleets Gather Off Jinzhong; Japanese Troops' Assault on Zhongshan County Foiled; Repeated Attempts to Land Repelled by Chinese Troops <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Hong Kong: In the Zhongshan area, which was recently attacked by Japanese troops by water, the situation along the coast was once tense. Although there have been no large-scale landing attempts to date, county residents have been displaced, markets are closed, traffic is blocked, and rice prices are soaring. The people in the coastal villages are in dire straits because their village houses and thatched huts have been destroyed by Japanese aircraft and artillery, leaving them nowhere to live. Carrying their sons and daughters, they have been displaced to other places, and many have become starving refugees. The most prosperous area of Zhongshan is Shiqi, where most of the county's institutions are located. After being bombed by Japanese aircraft on the 10th and 11th of the month, the city's situation suddenly felt bleak, and the population has been reduced by seventy to eighty percent. In order to prevent spies from mixing in, the commander of the Sixth District Guerrilla Forces has drafted four emergency wartime ordinances for Zhongshan and promulgated them on the 12th.</p>
<p>Shiqi Bombed: Although not many shops were destroyed in this bombing of Shiqi, the citizens did not dare to return to the city immediately to settle down. There was originally water and land transport from Shiqi to Macau, with the land route being the Qiguan long-distance bus. During the recent tense situation, the roadbed from Baishi Station to Shiqi was completely destroyed. After vehicles near Baishi were machine-gunned by Japanese aircraft twice, the number of passengers was even smaller. Even on the 14th, Japanese aircraft were still dispatched to spy on Qiguan buses near Baishi Township. In order to avoid air raids, the bus company changed its schedule to operate from Macau to Baishi Station only at night to facilitate the evacuation of the people. The section from Baishi north to Shiqi was completely suspended.</p>
<p>Traffic Blocked: In the coastal areas of Zhongshan, such as the sea near Dieshi in the Second District, Japanese warships and speedboats are still anchored, constantly spying. Three Japanese shallow-water warships and ten steamships are present in the waters outside Muzhou in the inner river of Dieshi and Xinhui. Their intention is to block the Yonglu traffic from Shiqi to Macau. Therefore, the supply of food and vegetables from the inland of Shiqi to Macau and Hong Kong has been interrupted in recent days, and the prices of food in Macau and Hong Kong have suddenly risen. The above-mentioned warships and speedboats are not only blocking the water traffic between Shiqi and Macau, but also the civilian ships traveling from Aodu to Sanbu (i.e., Kaiping Changsha, Xinchang, Di Hai, Gongyi, etc.) are also being blocked. The ships traveling between Sanbu and Macau have completely changed their routes and no longer pass through the waterways of Muzhou.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Spying: The Japanese navy and air force have continued to harass the entire territory of Zhongshan for days. Dieshi Quanlu and other places were burned by the Japanese army a few days ago and have become scorched earth, but the Japanese army has not dared to land again. The situation in this area has eased slightly, but the coast around Jinzhong in the Eighth District is still serious. From the 11th to the 12th, Japanese warships and speedboats constantly invaded Jinzhong, attempting to destroy the coastal blockade line in the area, and engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese mine warfare teams. On the 11th, one Japanese speedboat was sunk by a mine, and four other Japanese boats were bombed from the side. More than seventy Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. Later, Japanese soldiers landed on the desolate island of Liyutou near Jinzhong and dispatched troops to harass Huangjiao in the Ninth District of Zhongshan. There are currently four Japanese warships and thirty speedboats in the Jinzhong sea area, and Japanese aircraft are circling and spying in the vicinity all day long. At 6 p.m. on the 12th, Japanese warships fired artillery at the shore again, and Japanese soldiers attempted to land by speedboat. They were met with fierce resistance from local teams. The battle lasted until 10 p.m., when the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the resistance and retreated. On the morning of the 13th, another troop of Japanese soldiers sneaked to Hongwan by boat and opened fire on the coast, apparently probing the weakness of the Chinese troops in the area. After being met with a counterattack by the Chinese troops on the shore, the Japanese soldiers did not dare to linger. However, in recent days, many Japanese warships and speedboats have gathered in the sea area from Modaomen, Huzhoujiao, Shenwan Zhizhuzhou, Hongwan, Qirenshi, to Guadingjiao, waiting for an opportunity to cause trouble.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Flood Prevention Project in Jiangsu Province; Two Embankments to Be Built After Autumn <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Xinghua: Last year, the Yellow River breached its banks in Henan, and northern Jiangsu was located downstream and was the confluence of the Huai, Yi, and Si rivers. The terrain in the counties of the Lixiahe region was originally very low-lying, resulting in a vast flooded area and congested water accumulation. In order to reduce flood damage and increase agricultural production for farmers, Jiangsu Province, despite the military tension and construction difficulties, made every effort in March of this year to close off the Guihai Chexin two dams and cut off the flow, and to dredge the silted river channels leading to the sea. Fortunately, the accumulated water receded and spring plowing was not delayed. However, the breaches have not been blocked, and the threat of flooding in the autumn is a cause for concern, and preparations should be made in advance to avert disasters. After submitting a report, the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the Relief Committee dispatched Committee Member Zheng Zhaojing and Committee Member Cheng Jingsheng to Jiangsu to survey the situation and discuss an emergency relief plan, including the construction of the Yun Embankment, the repair of sluice gates, and the dredging of various ports leading to the sea, which would require approximately 580,000 yuan in construction costs. A request was submitted to the Ministry for an appropriation, and a reply was received approving a subsidy of 300,000 yuan, to be supplemented by the provincial government. Acting Chairman Han, considering that the flood season was imminent and the situation was urgent, convened a meeting with Zheng Zhaojing and local gentry, including Mr. Han Zishi, to decide on the organization of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee and the Northern Jiangsu Flood Prevention Committee, with Mr. Han Zishi and Acting Chairman Han each responsible for handling the Yellow River disaster relief and the emergency flood prevention project in the autumn. At the same time, the Yun Canal Engineering Bureau was instructed to expedite the construction of the Yun Embankment for defense. If the Yellow and Huai rivers do not rise simultaneously, the Guihai farms will be opened slowly, and the counties downstream will be able to harvest the early rice. Based on the past flood area of more than 40,000 square li and more than 2,000 mu of farmland, with a minimum harvest value of 5 yuan per mu, the benefit to the livelihood of the people downstream is not insignificant. Furthermore, Acting Chairman Han and others knew that in the counties downstream, every year when the Huai River rises, the fertile land of tens of thousands of square li east of the Yun Embankment and west of the Fan Gong Embankment becomes a lake, and the losses are incalculable. In order to fundamentally eliminate the threat of flooding, it is planned to carry out a project after autumn this year to build embankments to channel the water into the sea, so that the counties downstream will be free from flood disasters forever.</p>

<p>A dispatch from Qingpu: After Battalion Commander Wang Yulin of the ×th War Zone was stationed in Xixiang, Qingpu, on the 18th, Japanese troops stationed in Qingpu, together with more than 100 traitor troops, led by Zhou Gongda, the deputy commander of the traitorous Self-Defense Corps, invaded Xixiang. At the time, Battalion Commander Wang and a dozen of his team members were inspecting the area near the Lotus Temple in Xicen when they suddenly saw five civilian boats in the Xicen Dang area, advancing from east to west. Battalion Commander Wang immediately ordered them to stop the boats for inspection. Little did he know that the people on the boats were all disguised Japanese and traitorous troops. They pretended to approach the shore while simultaneously firing guns at the shore. Under the intense gunfire, Battalion Commander Wang was about to lead his team in a fierce charge when he was shot in the chest by a machine gun, hit by more than a dozen bullets, and tragically sacrificed himself for the country. When the battalion headquarters heard the news, they immediately led their teams to launch a fierce counterattack in separate directions. Seeing the situation was not good, the Japanese and traitorous troops collapsed and fled.</p>

<p>A dispatch from Wukang: After Wukang was recovered by the Chinese 108th Division, it actively carried out post-war relief work, and refugees returned one after another, with the most concentrated on the south bank of the Guan River. Unexpectedly, on the 11th, the Tamura unit of the Japanese troops in Hangzhou, under the cover of Japanese aircraft bombing, attempted to attack Wukang. They encountered the Chinese 62nd Division in the area of Lion Mountain Wangqian Mountain and were surrounded and fiercely attacked. The Japanese troops fled in disarray, with most of them killed or wounded. On the 17th, the defeated and残 Japanese troops were reinforced by the Inoue unit and suddenly attacked the Chinese military base in Lion Mountain, attempting to break through and re-invade Wukang. When they reached the Qinglong Mountain area south of the highway, they were discovered by the Chinese army and fiercely intercepted. Forty-six Japanese soldiers were killed.</p>

<p>(Special Dispatch from Chengdu) On June 11, 27 Japanese aircraft flew to Chengdu, and the southeastern district of the city and West China University outside the city were bombed. An air raid siren was issued at approximately 6:30 p.m. that day, and at 7:20 p.m., the Japanese aircraft arrived over the city, with their formation in the shape of a "W," flying directly south from the north. They passed over West China University at an altitude of five to six thousand meters. The first bomb dropped on the Jiangbian side, very close to the residences of the school's faculty members. The residence of Dr. Li Zhesheng (an American) of the school was bombed, and his wife was injured in her right buttock. The residence of Jinling University President Chen Yuguang was also destroyed, and his whole family was injured. Huang Xiaochuo, a second-year student in the Pharmaceutical Department of the school, and Cui Zhihua, a female student from Qilu University, were participating in rescue work and arrived at the site for assembly immediately after the first clear air raid signal. Huang was seriously injured and died immediately. Cui was also seriously injured. The second and third bombs landed near the library (one bomb was ten feet from the library, and one bomb was about thirty feet). Fortunately, they did not explode, but the glass and window frames were all shattered. The fourth bomb landed near the old Mingde Middle School's school building. It seemed to be extremely heavy and hit a large tree ten feet from the school building. It exploded before touching the ground, and the rear part of the school building was destroyed. The school building was the residence of the faculty and staff of Central University, and many people were injured, but fortunately there were no deaths. All the doors, windows, and ceilings of the medical buildings attached to the area were shattered, and many bombs were dropped on the livestock conservation center of the West China Theological Seminary nearby, killing several people. Several heavy bombs also landed near the South Gate, with property damage valued at more than 50,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Previously, the school had jointly organized the Five University Rescue Team with Central University, Jinling University, Ginling Women's College, and Qilu University. The entire team consisted of 360 members, divided into three detachments, with each squad divided into three shifts. On the morning of the 11th, they held a second major rehearsal, and the Japanese aircraft happened to come to Chengdu at 7:00 p.m. that afternoon. Before the air raid siren was lifted, the team opened a first-aid station at the West China University Medical Office and dispatched small rescue teams to rescue the disaster-stricken people in the bombed areas inside and outside the city. Excluding 43 people with minor injuries, who were bandaged and returned to their relatives, 85 people with more serious injuries were carried by the student stretcher bearers of the team to the emergency station in the school. Seven people with overly serious injuries died that night after treatment was ineffective. Thirteen people with less serious injuries, who had their heads and waists bandaged after being injured, returned home on their own. Fifteen people who had their heads and waists injured were sent to the Three University Joint Hospital in Sishengci by the team's stretcher bearers that night. The next morning, the other injured people were sent to the Sanshengci, Xizigong, and Shaanxi Street Three University Joint Hospital.</p>

<p>According to the villagers from Xin Zhuang in western Shanghai, a fierce guerrilla war took place in Hueshi Bridge, five kilometers north of Xin Zhuang Town, yesterday (21st). The area was originally stationed with the remnants of Xu Xinzhou. Since Xie Yimin, the new county magistrate of Songjiang, took office, he has gradually incorporated and trained the small guerrilla teams. Therefore, a large team of Xie's troops arrived at Cangshi Bridge a few days ago to incorporate the nearby miscellaneous teams. Just as they were about to start training, the Japanese spies detected this, and informed the Japanese army that Xie's strength was gradually increasing and should be eliminated as soon as possible and that Xie's elite troops were in Cangshi Bridge. The Japanese army, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched about 300 Japanese soldiers guarding the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, carrying more than a dozen light and heavy machine guns, and advanced from Songjiang and Meilong Town to the Cangshi Bridge area. Xie's troops had also learned that the Japanese army was coming to encircle and suppress them again, and immediately made preparations. At dawn on the 21st, the Japanese army had arrived at their destination, and the sound of dense gunfire suddenly rose. The battle was very fierce on both sides. Although the Japanese army came prepared, they encountered strong resistance and made no progress. Xie's troops also knew the geography well, and sent powerful troops to outflank the Japanese army from all sides. The Japanese army, because the gunfire was gradually approaching from all directions, was afraid of being surrounded and did not dare to love the battle, so they gradually retreated. In this battle, the Japanese army left behind a machine gun and more than a dozen rifles. Xie's troops suffered more than a dozen casualties. When the Japanese army retreated at about 9:00 am, they set fire to more than a dozen houses in the countryside to show their anger.</p>

<h3 id="e57">Intra-Industry Remittances Take Effect; Collateral Loans on Goods are Strictly Enforced; To Prevent Goods Hoarding and Rising Prices; A Large Amount of Legal Tender Has Been Transported to Shanghai by the Four Banks <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the intra-industry remittance system in the silver and money industry, all industries have benefited from the good system. Now, in order to prevent speculation and hoarding, all banks and stores strictly enforce collateral loans on goods. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Intra-Industry Remittances are Very Effective</p>
<p>Since the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks started handling the use of intra-industry remittances on July 4, all banks and stores have successively provided collateral and applied to the committee for intra-industry remittances. The committee's evaluation committee reviews and evaluates the prices at any time, and handles it according to 70% of the evaluation amount. The collateral is kept by the Custody Committee jointly formed by Chinese and foreign banks. In addition, the Preparation Inspection Committee jointly formed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and other groups is implementing the inspection of the remittance preparations of the banks and stores. The first committee meeting will be held soon to conduct public inspections. After the implementation of the remittance system, all industries in Shanghai have benefited greatly.</p>
<p>Preventing Speculation and Restricting Loans</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News learned from the silver and money industry yesterday that the Silver Money Industry Association, in view of the fact that after the announcement of the Ma telegram by the Ministry of Finance, the two industries, in order to stabilize the market, agreed with the China, China, and Communications Banks to convert the 22 million yuan of remittance deposits in the industry's deposit treasury into legal tender at a 5% discount and in 12 installments to prepare for the industry to pay legal tender deposits below 500 yuan, and separately formulated measures to provide collateral for intra-industry remittances for adjusting the industry's payment of remittance paintings above 500 yuan. It is now heard that the industry has relaxed the remittance of goods and loans, which makes general goods hoarding and rising prices, which helps speculation. Therefore, it is specially notified to all member banks and stores that collateral loans on goods should be tightened.</p>
<p>Legal Tender Transported to Shanghai to Regulate the Market</p>
<p>Recently, the rise of speculative undertakings in Shanghai has caused the black market foreign exchange to shrink sharply and the price of gold to soar. Therefore, the number of people withdrawing cash from the banks and stores has increased. The banks and stores have obtained the consent of the China, China, and Communications Banks to exchange the 2.2 million yuan of remittance chips stored in the treasury for legal tender chips in 12 weeks from July 4. Therefore, each bank and store can cope with the current environment and maintain the normal state of the entire finance. After the famous banknotes in various parts of North China are restricted from acceptance and redemption in order to prevent the purchase of foreign exchange, the market for legal tender chips suddenly became scarce. It is heard that the four banks of China, China, Communications, and Agriculture have transported a large number of legal tender chips to Shanghai in order to stabilize the market.</p>

<p>In the Italian military defense zone under the jurisdiction of the Putuo Road patrol room, a local anti-British action occurred at about 7:00 pm yesterday, and more than a dozen Chinese privately posted anti-British propaganda slogans near the boundary. After Putuo Road patrol room detectives caught a glimpse of the incident, they immediately reported to their superior, Mr. Watason. After receiving the report, Mr. Hua immediately went to check and ordered all the papers to be removed. Unexpectedly, several Chinese resisted, and the two sides had a dispute. Soon, police officers from the bogus "Police Station" rushed to the scene. Without asking why, they surrounded Mr. Hua and drove him out of the boundary to the bogus "Police Station." After receiving the news, the patrol room immediately reported to the authorities and notified the Italian military officer, who went to the bogus side to negotiate. The matter was resolved at about 8:00 pm, and Mr. Hua returned to the patrol room and reported the details to the authorities.</p>
<h3 id="e59">North Fujian Road: Removal of Manure Carts <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Merchants on North Fujian Road in this city have complained that from morning till noon, manure carts are constantly moving along the road, many of them leaking, which is a significant impediment to hygiene. The matter was referred by the Citizens' United Association to the Public Works Department of the Municipal Council. The City Association has now received a reply from the Public Works Department stating, "We have received your letters of June 30th to the Health Department and July 10th to this department, and we are fully aware of the situation. While it is impossible to relocate all garbage trucks on North Fujian Road, this department has devised methods to address the issue, in order to meet public expectations."</p>
<h3 id="e60">Tribute Rice Transactions Completed: Strict Enforcement of Price Controls; Management Committee Urges Rice Merchants Not to Hoard; New Rice Crops Approaching, No Need to Worry About Food Supply <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>After the price of national rice at the Shanghai Bean and Rice Market rose to the controlled price, market transactions became chaotic, and top-grade rice disappeared. The Management Committee has urged merchants to comply, and the concession authorities are strictly enforcing price controls. After 700 tons of foreign rice arrived in Shanghai, sales have commenced. There should be no need to worry about the overall food supply. Detailed information is provided below:</p>
<p>Management Committee Urges Enforcement of Price Controls</p>
<p>Due to tight foreign exchange and the lean season, sources are scarce. As a result, hoarders are unwilling to sell below the controlled price, leading to the disappearance of top-grade rice. The price of medium-grade rice has risen to the limit, which is inconsistent with the principle of price reduction for medium-grade rice stipulated by the concession authorities. Therefore, members of the Market Management Committee have separately urged the 105 merchants in the market not to exceed the controlled price set by the concession authorities. At the same time, the concession authorities are strictly enforcing price controls and hope that violations will be reported promptly so that they can be dealt with.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice Nears, No Need to Worry About Food Supply</p>
<p>Grain merchants previously commissioned the Dafu Foreign Firm to order foreign rice from Saigon, totaling 700 tons or 7,000 bags, with each bag weighing 198 catties, equivalent to 1.25 piculs. After being shipped and unloaded, it is temporarily stored in warehouses, divided into Saigon No. 1 and No. 2 grades. Sales have already begun, with No. 1 grade priced at 22 yuan per bag, and several hundred bags have already been sold. However, the price of No. 2 rice has not yet been determined. According to sources, the cost for grain merchants for No. 1 rice is 20.05 yuan, so selling at 22 yuan yields a considerable profit. However, due to the tight black market foreign exchange, no further orders have been placed for the time being.</p>
<p>New Rice Nears, No Need to Worry About Food Supply</p>
<p>Although the rice stored in the Shanghai concession is gradually decreasing, according to surveys, with only over 300,000 bags remaining, this does not include pre-purchases by citizens. The scarcity of sources is a phenomenon that occurs during the lean season. Fortunately, rice shipped from production areas to Shanghai has not been completely cut off. Moreover, early rice from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces is about to hit the market. Therefore, according to rice merchants' observations, there is no need to worry about the food supply in Shanghai. If there are no further typhoon attacks, a bumper harvest of late rice can be expected in various regions. It is determined that the typhoon in Luzon caused considerable damage to early rice in Zhejiang and Anhui provinces, but fortunately, it was not very severe.</p>
<p>Rice Prices Soar, Black Market Emerges</p>
<p>Currently, because sources from various production areas are relatively smooth, and the weather is hot, rice stored in warehouses is being sold off one after another. Rice prices have also fallen across the board due to the abundant spot market, with the highest price falling back to the 20 yuan level. The authorities and rice industry groups have lowered rice prices to adapt to the situation. However, with the tightening and fluctuation of foreign exchange, general speculative hoarders have taken the opportunity to rise, absorbing large quantities of rice. Rice and grain that had long been entrenched in the hands of non-industry players took advantage of this to hoard and wait for good prices to sell, resulting in more buyers than sellers and a supply-demand imbalance. Therefore, rice prices in Shanghai have continued to rise again in recent days. The black market, which should not exist in transactions and had long been banned by the authorities, has been revived. According to inquiries from reporters at the Da Guang News Agency, the black market price of top-grade rice has exceeded 21 yuan, and the price of medium-grade rice has also exceeded the controlled price. However, the hoarders are pretending to be in distress and waiting to sell at a high price. Since there is no written record of transactions between the two parties, it is extremely difficult to crack down on the black market.</p>
<p>Will Ban Transactions with Outsiders</p>
<p>According to inquiries from a reporter at the Da Guang News Agency, the main reason for the repeated surges in rice prices in the rice market is that the rice stored in Shanghai has been sold by industry players to non-industry players. These people have abundant funds and can manipulate everything at will. However, once the rice and grain are seized and hoarded by non-industry players, they become dead goods and will not be sold until the price is high. On the one hand, they continue to absorb large quantities. Currently, various rice industry groups are carefully studying and banning industry players from engaging in large transactions with outsiders in order to clarify the source and prevent market disruptions. If this measure can be fundamentally resolved in the future, the stability of the rice market transactions can be achieved once and for all.</p>

<p>After the Ningbo Defense Commander allowed foreign ships to resume the Shanghai-Ningbo route to facilitate cargo transportation, regarding the issue of resuming the Wenzhou route, the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander, after receiving requests from shipping merchants, has forwarded the request to the Commander-in-Chief of the Tenth Group Army for instructions. Resumption will occur as soon as approval is granted. However, according to inquiries from a reporter at the Xinsheng News Agency to the shipping industry, there are currently more than ten Japanese warships anchored in the waters of Wenzhou and Taizhou, repeatedly attempting to land, but they have been repelled. It is reported that Japanese warships recently loaded fishing boats with sand and stones and scuttled them outside the mouth of the Oujiang River and between the Huangda'ao Islands in Wenzhou Bay in an attempt to block the Wenzhou shipping route.</p>

<p>In order to encourage the people to concentrate their financial resources and fund national salvation expenses, the National Government issued National Salvation Bonds totaling 500 million yuan on September 1, 1937, with a specified annual interest rate of 4%. Interest payments will be made at the end of August each year starting from 1937, and principal repayment will begin in 30 years, with the bonds to be fully repaid in 30 years. One installment of principal will be repaid each year through lottery. The Ministry of Finance is designated to allocate funds from the national treasury revenue to repay the principal and interest. The bond issuance was entrusted by the Ministry of Finance to party headquarters at all levels, government agencies, and various organizations, and the full amount was raised long ago. The first installment of interest was fully paid by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications on August 31 of last year. The second installment of interest, totaling 20 million yuan, is scheduled to begin payment at the end of August. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency inquired from banking circles yesterday and learned that although the order to pay the interest due at the end of August on the National Salvation Bonds had not yet been received from the Ministry of Finance, it is said that the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are internally scheduled to make the payment at the end of August.</p>

<p>The Shaoxing Association is a well-known hometown association in this port, established for nearly 30 years. It recently held its eighth membership recruitment meeting, electing Pei Yunqing as the general leader, Pan Jiufen, He Gusheng, Hu Chunxiang, and Yan Chengde as deputy general leaders, Wang Juru as general staff, Huang Yuzhai and Xu Xiajun as deputy general staff, Zhang Yiqu and Qian Youlan as secretaries, and over 200 team leaders. Membership fees are still divided into four categories: 200 yuan, 20 yuan, 5 yuan, and 2 yuan. Yesterday afternoon (23rd) was the date for the second announcement of results. A meeting was held at a Jiayichun restaurant on Fourth Road. General and deputy leaders, general and deputy staff, and team leaders Yuan Ludeng, Pei Zhenyong, Huang Yuzhai, Yan Shuixin, Luo Guixiang, Cen Zhiliang, Zhao Zichuan, Lu Zhinan, Jiang Quanmao, Mao Xianshen, Zheng Wentong, Liu Wuqiao, Yu Xuetang, Li Ao Kui, Mao Fengzhi, Chen Guangzhao, Wang Moda, Feng Meitang, Feng Meixue, Tu Kaizheng and over 200 others attended, gathering together and making it a grand occasion.

<h3 id="e65">Tianjin Silver is Purely Deposits of Chinese Merchants; Japanese Side Requests Transfer of Custody from British Side; British Side Respects Credit and Refuses <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>According to dispatches, during the Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo, the Japanese side included in its proposed amendments that the Chinese silver currently deposited with the British side in Tianjin be handed over to the Chinese side (i.e., the Provisional Reorganized Government). A reporter from the Da Guang News Agency interviewed prominent figures in the financial community about this matter yesterday. According to them, there is no reason for the Japanese side's request. The depositors of this 40-50 million yuan of silver are all Chinese merchants who deposited with the British side. The deposit or custody relationship is purely based on mutual trust between merchants. Merchants cannot be considered political figures, and silver deposits have no political implications. Chinese banks such as the Bank of Communications and other commercial institutions are demanding the return of the silver. How could this silver be considered ownerless? We deeply believe that the British authorities will uphold their credit and not waver in the face of this silver deposit, and will definitely reject the Japanese side's unreasonable request. It is believed that the Tokyo conference is purely between the British and Japanese sides regarding the Tianjin incident. The so-called incident refers to general political and military matters, and it is absolutely impossible to overstep and arbitrarily dispose of the silver issue. Team leader Cen Zhiliang's individual score of 918 was the highest. During the meeting, Pei Yunqing, Huang Yuzhai, Xu Xiajun, and Shou Xiaotian delivered speeches in succession. Pei said that the eighth recruitment term is coming to an end, and he hopes to double the results. Those who have already joined should introduce others as much as possible, and those who have not joined should join automatically. Huang said that complacency is regression. Although the results have broken the record of this term, we still need to make a final effort to achieve a more satisfactory harvest. It is said that the association has set the end of this month as the deadline for recruitment, and at that time, there will be a performance of wonderful entertainment to add to the fun.</p>

<h3 id="e66">Japanese Liaison Officer Denies Detention of American Missionary; Claims Someone is Sowing Discord Between Japan and the United States; Attitude Towards the United States is Quite Accommodating <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the whereabouts of American missionary Hallan in Nanchang, and the rumors that he was detained by the Japanese side, have suddenly gone silent for almost six weeks. According to a certain lieutenant colonel, a Japanese liaison officer, at a press conference yesterday (22nd), the missionary is currently residing in Nanchang Hospital and often stays there. The report by "a certain American news agency" that Hallan was detained and his whereabouts are unknown, originating from Hankou, is a deliberate attempt by certain parties to create disputes between the United States and Japan. The Nanchang and Hankou Japanese military headquarters have formally denied this. Furthermore, a staff officer of the Japanese army in Nanchang, who is currently in Hankou, was quite surprised by this statement because Hallan is currently maintaining friendly contact with the Japanese army. The Japanese commander in Nanchang often invites Hallan to dine with him. The whole problem arose because a large number of anti-Japanese leaflets and other printed materials were found in the Nanchang Youth Association, which is managed by the Nanchang Hospital under Hallan's supervision. Therefore, the person in charge was held responsible for the confiscated leaflets and magazines, and that person was Hallan. Jervis, the American acting consul general in Hankou, then requested the convenience of going to Nanchang to investigate the anti-Japanese printed matter. The Japanese side did not approve this request because Nanchang is very close to the front line, and this is a local matter that should be resolved by the Japanese military authorities in Nanchang and the relevant personnel of the Youth Association.</p>
<p>The rumor that Hallan was detained is based on Jervis' claim that Hallan did not reply to his letter and was issued in Hankou. This statement is "completely groundless." At the same time, Hallan has written to Jervis. When asked if he believed the rumor that he was detained, or when he inquired when this reply was sent, and when the American consul in Hankou received it, the liaison officer replied that he had forgotten the date. He also said that he himself (tomorrow, the 23rd) will meet with the American consul general in Shanghai, Gauss, to discuss the details of the Hallan case, and the conclusions of the conversation will be announced. It is also rumored that other American citizens are currently being detained by the Japanese side, "which is also inaccurate." When asked if the Japanese side believed that Hallan was related to transmitting information to the Chinese guerrillas, the response was that there was no credible reason. The Japanese military in Shanghai received information that Hallan is a person of good reputation and often resides in the hospital, and he is currently residing there. Because guerrillas often break into Nanchang, and it is close to the front line, the situation is still unstable. A curfew is being implemented for foreign nationals, but it is hoped that the curfew will be lifted in August. An official from the American Consulate General in this port confirmed to reporters yesterday that the American Consulate in Hankou had received a letter from Hallan. Although the official refused to disclose the contents of the letter, he stated that it was "a reaffirmation of his position." American Consul General Gauss replied to inquiries that he was unaware of the Japanese liaison officer's claim that "he will hold talks with Gauss tomorrow."</p>

<p>Japanese warships in Zhejiang waters have been active again recently. A Japanese warship sailed to Hutou Ferry on the north bank of Xiangshan Port on the 21st and fired two shots at Tongjiao in Fenghua. Also, at 8:00 AM yesterday, a Japanese warship outside Zhenhai Port in the Nan Hongyang waters fired nine shots at Zhenhai. At noon, it went to the Xiepu waters and fired six shots at South Xiepu. At 2:00 PM, it fired over ten shots at Longshan. At 4:00 PM, it sailed back to Zhenhai Port and fired five shots at Zhenhai, constantly causing disturbances. The garrison has been on high alert.</p>
<p>Japan Attempts to Prevent Resumption of Shanghai-Wenzhou Route</p>
<p>More than ten Japanese warships are currently anchored in the waters of Wenzhou and Taizhou, repeatedly attempting to land along the coast, but they have been repelled by the defending soldiers. Now, over a thousand captured fishing boats are loaded with sand and stones and scuttled outside the mouth of the Oujiang River and between the Huangda'ao Islands in Wenzhou Bay, blocking the shipping route between Shanghai and Wenzhou. Therefore, the resumption of shipping between Shanghai and Wenzhou is impossible to realize.</p>
<p>Moufu and Fulai Liners Arrive in Zhenhai</p>
<p>According to inquiries from a reporter at the Datong News Agency, the Lihe and Moufu liners are scheduled to depart from Qiliyu, Zhenhai, at 4:00 PM today and arrive in Shanghai. They are expected to arrive around 3:00 PM this afternoon. It is said that these liners encountered a typhoon in Zhenhai and had to sail to Jintang to take shelter, causing considerable delays. It is said that there are hundreds of passengers and local products on board today's trip to Shanghai. The Far East Hana Liner and the Sino-Italian Deping Liner both left Shanghai and sailed to Zhenhai the day before yesterday, arriving at Qiliyu, Zhenhai, before 4:00 PM on the same day. Passengers were transferred to Ningbo that evening. It is now learned that the Hana Liner is scheduled to leave Zhenhai and return to Shanghai on the 26th, while the Deping Liner is scheduled to leave Zhenhai and return to Shanghai on the 29th.</p>

<h3 id="e70">High Density of Residents in the Isolated Island; Pawnbroking Develops Abnormally; Increased to Over One Hundred After the War; High-Interest Exploitation Should Be Stopped <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The pawnbroking industry in Shanghai was not very prosperous before the war, and the number of establishments was extremely small. After the war, the number of residents fleeing from various places to this isolated island suddenly increased. As the standard of living gradually increased, they were all forced to turn to pawning their clothes and ornaments. As a result, the pawnbroking industry developed abnormally, and each establishment profited handsomely. According to inquiries from the pawnbroking industry yesterday, the terms of these pawnbrokers are usually set at six months to eight months, ten months, or twelve months. The principal amounts are rarely large sums. The interest rate is ostensibly two or three percent, not far from the larger sums, but in reality, the monthly interest is calculated on a ten-day period, with one yuan requiring two to three cents of interest. After ten days, the interest is compounded. One day into the next month is counted as ten days of interest, plus harsh items such as storage box fees. Each yuan of principal can earn more than two dimes per month, and the term is very short, which can expire in an instant. Each month, the pawned clothes and packages can be assessed, yielding a considerable profit. As such, the result of one yuan of principal revolving in a circle can earn three or four dimes of interest. In recent years, the number of establishments in this industry is over 150 in the city, using neon lights to decorate their storefronts, which is unprecedented in the pawnbroking industry. If the commercial authorities can order the industry to reduce interest rates and extend the term, it may not be for the happiness of the general public.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Female Foreman (Part Two) <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Wenqin</p>
<p>Because the current factory site is smaller, the lunch hours for male and female workers are separated. We have lunch at 11:30, and they have lunch at 12:00 noon. And our work start time is also half an hour earlier than theirs. Speaking of eating, I think of a special thing, that is, there are a lot of vegetarians in our group, what Nine Emperor Vegetarian, White Robe Vegetarian, Zhu Tian Vegetarian, Guanyin Vegetarian, Lei Zhai Vegetarian, and those vegetarian diets that I can't remember. They choose the good ones and follow them, and even one person eats several vegetarian diets at the same time. I heard that eating White Robe Vegetarian will ensure good health, eating Zhu Tian Vegetarian can achieve the wish of seeking wealth and children, eating Guanyin Vegetarian can be born with a beautiful face in the next life, eating Lei Zhai Vegetarian can avoid epidemics... The dates for eating vegetarian food are one, seven, ten, three, six, nine, every second, every sixth, etc. There are also several days of vegetarian food in a row, and there are also so-called light vegetarian diets, which almost confuse my brain. I now realize that these girls value the merit of eating vegetarian food so much. They will talk eloquently about the stories of eating vegetarian food, and some people next to them will also confirm the miraculous examples. I told them that except for Lei Zhai Vegetarian, which is more meaningful—because the dates for eating vegetarian food are from the first day of June to the end of June in the lunar calendar, so in such hot weather, eating vegetarian food can also unintentionally avoid many infectious diseases. The rest are meaningless. Why do you sacrifice your taste for nothing? At this time, friends who do not eat vegetarian food winked at me one after another, and they also got a warning on their feet. It seemed to be saying, "Don't mind them, they eat vegetarian food, and we can eat more dishes!"</p>
<p>As soon as the bell for the female workers to go to work rang, the sound of reading scriptures in the workshop suddenly stopped. Then the male workers had finished their meal. A crisp and melodious Beijing opera tune accompanied by the gentle sound of the erhu, followed the wind, followed the stairs, slowly, in bursts, drifting into the workshop. At this time, everyone's mind was refreshed, and the hard work of half a day had long since vanished.</p>
<p>Speaking of their reading, I can't help but recall what happened last winter. At that time, I felt that they would damage their health if they stayed in the room all day, so I encouraged them to go to the platform to bask in the sun. Those older girls chatted in twos and threes arm in arm. The smaller ones jumped and jumped, Tiger Mountain, hide-and-seek... They have played all the games that little angels in school can think of. Happiness and satisfaction overflowed from every innocent smile. It was at this time that I felt sorrow and pity, and it was from this time that I began to fulfill my responsibilities in my position—helping them to read. The level ranged from the first book of "Little Cat" to the first grade of high school in "A Poor Child". From the fool A Niu, etc. who bought books without stinginess and brought them to me, to the shyest A Ying, etc. who trembling held the books close to me, and finally everyone held a book in their hands. Tell my friends a piece of news: now they can also draw their names on their pay slips.</p>
<p>What we feel now is that the factory is a bit small, but our big factory has already started construction. All kinds of perfect equipment are planned and controlled by our manager. Before the end of the year, we will be able to move into this ideal paradise. Every worker thinks about this, or when everyone talks about it, they always unknowingly become excited.</p>
<p>Our country's industry has always lagged behind others, and for industries such as needles, it is even unheard of in the country. How many merchants know that Chinese people can make needles themselves and come to order them one after another. Our factory can produce 1 million needles a day, but it is often not enough to cope, which shows everyone's love for domestic products. I don't have a lot of capital, and I don't have the talent of an entrepreneur, so I can't start a business, but being able to be in the ranks of the emerging industry, being a small soldier waving the flag and shouting, and fulfilling some of my responsibilities, is not without value!</p>

<p>Due to the serious situation in Europe this spring, the Shanghai Marine Insurance Association drastically increased war risk rates several times.

The following rates are recorded below (insurance rates below are calculated per 100 yuan): Shanghai to the United Kingdom or Europe (excluding the Baltic and Mediterranean) has been reduced from 1.5 yuan to 0.625 yuan; to North and South America via the Cape of Good Hope, Panama, or the Pacific, from 1 yuan to 0.375 yuan; to the Straits Settlements, India, and East Africa, from 0.75 yuan to 0.25 yuan; to various Mediterranean ports (including Mediterranean surcharges), from 1.75 yuan to 0.5 yuan; to Australia, from 1 yuan to 0.25 yuan; to other Qian and China Yinhae ports, still 0.375 yuan. Furthermore, unless the Mediterranean surcharge is specifically noted above, a surcharge of 0.125 yuan per 100 yuan will be added for all voyages passing through the Mediterranean or Baltic Sea (previously 1 yuan per day).</p>

<p>The price of daily necessities such as coal balls and white coal in this city has risen again and again due to the impact of foreign exchange contraction. The price of coal lumps has increased by more than ten yuan per ton compared to before, and the price of coal balls has risen by several jiao per dan. However, the supply is still smooth. Some small and medium-sized coal ball factories have been unable to maintain production due to the increase in coal prices and raw material costs, and have stopped work one after another. Larger factories have increased their shipments to meet market needs, but the continued rise in coal prices has had a significant direct and indirect impact on citizens.</p>

<p>Shen Linwu, a native of Suzhou residing at 16 Connaught Road, currently works in the banking sector. His father, Shen Zhisheng, served as the chief of the documentation section and other positions at the Bank of China in this city for 28 years and had some savings. On September 27, 1937, Shen Zhisheng personally wrote a will, with clear provisions for how his property should be distributed after his death. After Shen Zhisheng died of illness on February 1 of this year, his estate was managed by his son and daughter, Shen Linyu and Shen Weihua. Shen Zhongsuzhen (36 years old this year, a native of Suzhou), Shen Zhisheng's widow, presented her husband's handwritten will to Shen Linyu and others, who did not object. However, Shen Linyu and others have not distributed their father's estate, such as a pension of 11,520 yuan, savings of more than 2,250 yuan, an annuity of 1,380 yuan, 18 shares of Bank of China stock, insurance of 2,000 yuan, term deposits of 5,660 yuan, and current deposits of 1,701 yuan, to his stepmother Shen Zhongsuzhen and her young daughter Shen Xuehua (Zhong's biological daughter), according to the will. Therefore, Shen Zhongsuzhen and her daughter Xuehua recently filed a petition with the Civil Mediation Tribunal of the First Special District Court, requesting that Shen Linyu and others be summoned to mediate and distribute Shen Zhisheng's estate according to the will. Because Shen Linyu and others were unwilling to abide by the will, the mediation failed. On the 18th of this month, Judge Zheng of the Mediation Tribunal advised that a separate lawsuit could be filed. Now, Shen Zhongsuzhen and her daughter Shen Xuehua have decided to hire lawyers Ma Junshuo and others to formally file a lawsuit for property division according to law.</p>

<p>Yesterday evening at around 6 PM, two female customers, elegant in demeanor and fashionable in dress, came to the Baochang Jewelry Store in Jing'an Commercial District on Jing'an Temple Road. They claimed to want to buy diamond rings. The store clerk warmly welcomed them and took out diamond rings for them to choose.

Upon counting them, it was found that 50 yuan was missing. The clerk handed the money back to the female customer for re-inspection. Unexpectedly, in that instant, she replaced a bundle of real money with fake money. Indeed, 50 yuan was missing, and she said she did not have any more money with her. She suggested that the store clerk go with her to her home to get the money. Then, holding the diamond rings, she walked out of the store and fled.

<p>Yu Zhong'e, formerly a comprador, currently residing at No. 14 Henry Lane, Henry Road, rented a building located at No. 40 Jingu Village, Rue Pere Robert, from the Mei Hua Real Estate Company on October 1, 1934, for a monthly rent of 75 yuan. On January 21 of the following year, Yu, due to business, went to Hong Kong with his lover, Lu Manqing, and sublet the house to Cai Yuying, a female teacher and third tenant, for 200 yuan. Cai and Lu Manqing were also good friends. When Yu left Shanghai, in addition to handing over receipts for electricity, water, and deposits, etc., as previously agreed, he also deposited furniture worth several hundred yuan with Cai, agreeing to pay Cai 30 yuan per month for storage rent. Later, because Yu did not send rent from Hong Kong, Cai sent a letter urging him to do so. Lu Manqing replied, instructing Cai to sell the furniture and use the proceeds to pay the rent. On May 24 of last year, Yu's family came to Shanghai, and Cai demanded the storage rent for the furniture again. Yu then hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Li Gengxiang to file a complaint with the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, accusing Cai of encroaching on the house, claiming that the house at No. 40 Jingu Village was entrusted to Cai for care and was not sublet. In addition to requesting that Cai be punished for encroachment and breach of trust, etc., they also filed a civil lawsuit, requesting that Cai be ordered to vacate the premises. Cai also filed a counterclaim, requesting that Yu be punished for false accusation. After investigation by the court, both Yu Zhong'e and Cai Jinying were found not guilty. Cai expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and hired lawyers Wu Chuliang and Zhang Hongwei to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the High Court. At the same time, Yu abandoned the criminal appeal and hired lawyers Jiang Yiping and Li Gengxiang to file a civil lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting that Cai be ordered to return the house. Yu lost the first instance of the case and remained dissatisfied.</p>
<p>After repeated appeals, the Supreme Court ruled in the third instance that Cai Jinying was the second landlord of No. 40 Jingu Village. After Yu lost the third instance, he legally became a third tenant. Therefore, Cai also hired lawyers Wu Chuliang and Zhang Hongwei to file a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, requesting that Yu be ordered to pay more than 1,000 yuan in storage rent for the furniture. The case was recently ruled by the court, confirming that Yu should pay Cai 46 months of rent at 20 yuan per month, totaling 920 yuan. The Civil Court has now</p>
<p>executed the judgment according to law. Regarding Cai's counterclaim against Yu for false accusation, when the Chief Judge of the Criminal Division of the Third Branch of the High Court, Wu Tingqi, and Judges Wang and Chen opened the third courtroom for trial the other day, the defense lawyer for the appellant Yu Zhong'e requested a postponement, stating that the civil litigation between the two parties had come to an end and that they should first resolve the civil part before proceeding with the criminal case. The attorney for the appellant Cai Jinying, Wu Chuliang, agreed. The court then granted the postponement and ordered a retrial at a later date.</p>

<p>At around 11 PM on the night before last, seven or eight robbers suddenly came to the home of Gu Jintang in Taojiazhai, Great West Road, West Shanghai. Each held a handgun and broke into the house. Gu's entire family was awakened from their dreams and threatened with guns, forbidden to make any noise. They ransacked the house, searching through boxes and chests, and stole clothing and silver dollars worth more than a hundred yuan. The robbers were not satisfied and broke into the bedroom of the Zhu family next door. Zhu was not yet asleep and fired several shots from his own handgun towards the door. The robbers also fired back, but fortunately no one was injured. At this time, police sirens were heard outside, and the robbers, seeing the situation was not good, fled into the darkness. Yesterday, the military police, together with the puppet police, conducted a door-to-door search in the Taojiazhai area, but found nothing. Wang Liandi, a 14-year-old girl from Ningbo residing at No. 317 Caishi Road, was crossing the road westward in front of her house at 4:20 PM on the 22nd when a French No. 18 trolleybus No. 159 traveling between Xieqiao and the North Station was coming from the south to the north. She was unable to avoid it and was knocked down, crushing her abdomen and causing her intestines to protrude. The police investigated and recorded the number and sent the injured person to Guangci Hospital. Treatment was ineffective, and she died at 10 PM that night. The police sent the body to the Tongren Funeral Home for an autopsy and notified the family and the driver to report to the court for an inspection today.</p>

<h3 id="e90">How to Promote the Exchange Clearing System in the Future <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Juzeng</p>
<p>Starting from July 1st, the exchange clearing deposits of the Shanghai Banking and Money Exchange and the Reserve Bank, estimated at 22 million yuan, have been agreed to be converted into legal tender at a 95% discount, and the exchange will be converted into legal tender over twelve weeks. At the same time, the Joint Reserve Committee will begin handling new exchange clearing withdrawals. All the details and regulations have been reported in the newspapers, and everyone is already familiar with them, so I won’t go into detail here. Now, let’s discuss how to promote the exchange clearing system in the future to cope with the environment after the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram is implemented.</p>
<p>Originally, Shanghai’s exchange clearing bills could be cashed the next day. Since August 13th the year before last, the Ministry of Finance promulgated measures to stabilize finance, stipulating that exchange clearing bills were limited to collection and settlement between the same industries, so exchange clearing bills became a kind of non-cashable chips. Those who held exchange clearing bills – namely, only had exchange clearing deposits – and urgently needed legal tender had to discount them at a reduced value. Therefore, discounting became a standard public business for small money shops in Shanghai. Initially, the discount was only six or seven yuan per thousand, but later it became higher and higher, averaging around fifty yuan, implicitly setting the exchange rate between exchange clearing bills and legal tender at a 95% discount, which also became the calculation standard for the old exchange clearing conversion.</p>
<p>The difference between the old and new exchange clearing is that the former is a chip guaranteed by credit, while the latter is a chip guaranteed by material assets. As for not being able to cash out and being limited to deposits and transfers between banks and shops, they are the same. So, strictly speaking, this is a strengthening and improvement in the guarantee aspect, not a new or old problem in the system, because the system has always been consistent.</p>
<p>We must know that the exchange clearing system after August 13th is a transfer system. Speaking of the transfer system, Ningbo has been using it for decades, and it has become a habit over time, and the transfer of actual currency has become a burden. Therefore, Ningbo has the reputation of being a "transfer pier." Moreover, there must be a period every year when "crossing the ocean" – equivalent to Shanghai’s current exchange clearing – is more valuable than cash. This was the case in peacetime, and it was also the case after August 13th. The development and popularization of the local transfer system is certainly due to its long history and deep roots; in addition, there is another point worth noting, that is, the local financial industry uses interest rates to promote the transfer system. Originally, Ningbo money shops never opened silver drafts, only Ningbo drafts. If you deposit cash with them, they will not give interest, or even refuse to accept it. Only when it is converted into "crossing the ocean" drafts can they give interest every month according to the market discount rate. At the same time, they also only lend "crossing the ocean" drafts, not cash. Therefore, anyone who has a creditor-debtor relationship with them must use "crossing the ocean" drafts. Although cash is needed to purchase goods in the countryside when rice is on the market, or cash demand suddenly increases due to the situation, causing cash to rise, this is only a temporary phenomenon and will not affect the widespread use of the transfer system. Therefore, although Ningbo is one of the earliest five treaty ports, its cash circulation – that is, demand – is very limited. If we want to cope with the current environment in Shanghai, limit the circulation of legal tender, and promote the use of the exchange clearing system, then the established methods of Ningbo seem worth considering. Since August 13th, the monthly interest on exchange clearing deposits in Shanghai has always been around three yuan; while the interest on current legal tender deposits averages between 4% and 5% per annum – referring to deposits made by customers in banks. In other words, the interest rate on legal tender deposits is higher than that on exchange clearing deposits, which is also a reason why exchange clearing is less attractive than legal tender. Since June of this year, the monthly discount rate for exchange clearing has often been around two jiao, so the monthly interest on exchange clearing deposits will reach about six yuan in the future. This measure can greatly encourage customers to accept exchange clearing chips, thereby generating interest. We further hope that banks and money shops will make further representations in the future. It is best to stipulate a period of time, from which point on, no interest or very low interest will be given for using legal tender or clearing credits to deposit or open new current deposit accounts. As for old deposits and time deposits, they may be handled as before. At the same time, the interest rate for current exchange clearing deposits will be calculated monthly according to the discount rate, which is equivalent to an annual interest rate of 7% under the current situation. In this way, people who hold exchange clearing chips will have a definite and reliable guarantee and a favorable interest rate, and they will naturally be more willing to accept them. Regarding this method, some people may worry that foreign banks are currently desperately absorbing legal tender deposits, and the profits from foreign exchange arbitrage are high, which may turn into a situation of “driving fish into deep waters.” In fact, this is no longer a problem at all. First, foreign banks originally do not give interest on current legal tender deposits. Although one or two accept savings deposits and give interest at their discretion, the amount deposited per household per month is limited. Moreover, several leading foreign banks have always sympathized with us and may establish some kind of agreement with them from a diplomatic or industry-related perspective, asking them to refuse to accept legal tender deposits. As for foreign exchange arbitrage, several large banks on the Bund have already shown a tendency to not allow swap trading, and the possibility of arbitrage trading is gradually disappearing. At this time, if we take a two-pronged approach and use interest rate policies to promote the exchange clearing system, we can achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Not only that, but since each bank and shop has obtained exchange clearing chips for all of its assets, then in the future, the financing of funds for various industries should also be limited to exchange clearing chips. This measure, in the banks and shops themselves, means that one set of capital generates two sets of chips, with two sets of operations. The convenience of this is self-evident. In terms of various industries, since the loans obtained are limited to exchange clearing chips, then the procurement of all raw materials and the wholesale of goods will inevitably be traded with counterparts in the mainland or those who can accept exchange clearing chips within the scope as much as possible. In this way, with repeated cycles, the promotion of the exchange clearing system will inevitably become gradually universal.</p>
<p>As for the issuance of clearing certificates, the current regulation stipulates that the minimum denomination is 500 yuan. I believe that it may be possible to issue two types, 50 yuan and 100 yuan. (In accordance with Article 10 of the Law on the Implementation of Negotiable Instruments). This can facilitate circulation. If we are concerned that the outside world may misunderstand it as an incomprehensible circulating note, then the facts are the best answer, and it will naturally be cleared up soon. I think that 500 yuan and 50 yuan are nothing more than a difference of a hundred steps and fifty steps. In this way, people who hold exchange clearing bills, if they are convenient for transfer or do not want to deposit them in banks and shops, can exchange them for exchange clearing certificates directly guaranteed by the reserve committee for circulation. When everyone recognizes the true value of exchange clearing certificates, then the exchange clearing system will become popular even if it is not yet popular.</p>
<p>Also, according to this new exchange clearing withdrawal method, each bank and shop has to pay interest on how much they withdraw, which is actually equivalent to a disguised mortgage. This will inevitably make banks and shops with sufficient capital reluctant to do so. Although the old exchange clearing has been eliminated, they have to be forced to withdraw new exchange clearing, but they will definitely weigh the pros and cons and only withdraw the daily exchange difference. In this way, the chips will definitely not increase much. We certainly do not advocate the improper slackening of exchange clearing chips, but on the one hand, since the circulation of legal tender is restricted, then for the sake of promoting the exchange clearing system, exchange clearing chips should seem to be appropriately increased. In that case, the difference between the interest on withdrawals and the interest on deposits should be smaller. At the same time, no interest should be calculated on the withdrawal of exchange clearing certificates before the final transfer to the reserve committee. This may also help promote the exchange clearing system.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Proposed Foreign Exchange Control Plan <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Chuantong</p>
<p>The recent financial turmoil in Shanghai is centered on foreign exchange. Without controlling foreign exchange, it is impossible to stabilize finance, and without controlling trade, it is impossible to control foreign exchange. I have already said this when discussing whether Shanghai could be changed to a clearing port. Before long, the government promulgated the new measures to prohibit the import of goods and the two measures for the settlement of import and export goods and the payment of differences, and also declared that the government would not supply foreign exchange to the occupied areas. The day before yesterday, the legal tender with the place name of North China was restricted, and the next day, the supply of foreign exchange to Shanghai was restricted, causing foreign exchange to shrink to four or five pence. For the sake of brevity, I have listed the various problems and the proposed methods of foreign exchange control below. This matter is related to the future of Shanghai’s industry and commerce and the residents, so it cannot be neglected. I hope that the experts will teach me.</p>
<p>(1) Difficulties of the government before the new policy (before June 7)</p>
<p>(1) The government cannot stabilize the value of the currency if it does not maintain foreign exchange, because the current legal tender is a foreign exchange standard, and at the same time, if it does not maintain foreign exchange, it will lose the country’s financial credit to the outside world.</p>
<p>(2) If you want to maintain foreign exchange, you must balance international trade, that is, reduce imports and increase exports. However, the customs of the occupied areas have been seized and cannot implement the prohibition of imports.</p>
<p>(3) If you want to maintain foreign exchange, you cannot rely solely on the balancing fund, because the fund is limited and the supply of foreign exchange is endless. Therefore, it is necessary to increase revenue and reduce expenditure. Reducing expenditure means restricting imports. Increasing revenue means making exporters sell foreign exchange to banks that can be controlled by the government. However, the legal price is higher than the black market price, so the value of foreign currency is high in the black market, and low in the banks that can be controlled by the government, that is, the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications. Therefore, exporters are willing to sell in the black market, because foreign currency can be exchanged for more legal tender in the black market. Therefore, it is not easy for the government to obtain foreign exchange, and at the same time, it has to sell foreign exchange, which is like sitting back and eating away at its resources.</p>
<p>(4) The reasons for the decline in foreign exchange are (A) the purchase by wealthy traitors, (B) inconvenient transportation, production stagnation, increased costs, and low domestic purchasing power of legal tender. (C) Excess of imports over exports. All three of the above reasons cannot be completely controlled.</p>
<p>(2) The true intention of the government under the new policy (according to the rules for prohibiting the import of 234 kinds of goods and the new measures for the settlement of import and export goods)</p>
<p>(1) Increase exports and suppress imports.</p>
<p>(2) Actually change the legal price to about seven pence. (A) It can prevent mainland exporters from selling foreign exchange to the black market, because mainland exporters have to go through remittance and other expenses to sell foreign exchange to the black market. Now the difference between the legal price and the black market price is not much, so there is no loss in selling to the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications, and there is no benefit in selling to the black market. (B) To make it consistent with the estimated current purchasing power of legal tender.</p>
<p>(3) Restrictions on withdrawals and no supply of foreign exchange to Shanghai and the occupied areas can make (A) wealthy traitors unable to buy the foreign exchange exchanged by mainland export goods. (B) Not responsible for repaying the excess of imports over exports in the occupied areas.</p>
<p>(4) In this way, the source of foreign exchange can be increased, the outflow of foreign exchange can be reduced, the external value of legal tender can be stabilized, and the conspiracy of traitors can be prevented.</p>
<p>(3) Results of the new policy</p>
<p>(1) Due to the new level of exchange rate, the price of goods has risen, sales have shrunk, and the foreign exchange required by merchants for legitimate purposes has decreased.</p>
<p>(2) Doubts about legal tender have arisen, and the absorption by the wealthy is even worse. (Causing withdrawals)</p>
<p>(3) Bad people intend to make counterfeit notes popular, so they exchange counterfeit notes for legal tender. The legal tender obtained has no use, so they are still willing to absorb it even if the exchange rate is low.</p>
<p>(4) Due to the above two reasons, foreign exchange has shrunk to four and a half pence.</p>
<p>(5) The difference between the black market and the new legal price is another three tenths.</p>
<p>(6) There is a deep fear of causing a continued decline. Finance and enterprises have suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>(4) The author proposes the government’s control measures for the controlled area</p>
<p>(1) No longer devalue the new legal price. However, mainland exporters must hold settlement vouchers from the Central Bank before they are allowed to export. In this way, the source of foreign exchange can be intercepted.</p>
<p>(2) Appoint personnel to carry out the self-sufficiency system of foreign exchange in the Shanghai area.</p>
<p>(3) Before the new system in the Shanghai area is stable, it will still maintain six and a half pence.</p>
<p>(5) The author proposes measures for the control of finance, industry and commerce in Shanghai</p>
<p>(1) Establish a foreign exchange clearing house and implement a self-sufficiency system.</p>
<p>(2) The clearing house is organized by Chinese and foreign import and export merchants and Chinese and foreign exchange banks.</p>
<p>(3) Those who buy and sell foreign exchange should apply to the clearing house before the corresponding period. After approval, import and export can be carried out.</p>
<p>(4) The purpose of the clearing house is to balance the supply and demand of foreign exchange. The exchange rate should be fixed at six and a half pence to avoid the difference in value between legal tender in the mainland and Shanghai.</p>
<p>(5) Members of the clearing house should establish a gentleman’s agreement not to buy foreign exchange unless approved by the clearing house. However, the clearing house can sell foreign exchange when it believes that there is a surplus of foreign exchange positions.</p>
<p>(6) Conclusion of this article: According to articles (4) and (5), the government will not be affected by the changes in Shanghai and affect the new policy. In Shanghai, it will not be permanently anxious about foreign exchange changes due to relying on the maintenance of the Central Bank and being controlled by the traitors to obtain foreign exchange. However, it is hoped that the leaders of our banking and business circles will consider whether the proposed article (5) can be implemented. If we continue to allow foreign exchange to be laissez-faire as it is now, I am afraid that the consequences will be disastrous for both Chinese and foreign business circles.</p>
<h3 id="e92">New Posture of Industrial Construction in the Southwest (Part 1) <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Erjia</p>
<p>New Policies and Implementation Competition</p>
<p>The Southwest—this article only refers to Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces—before the War of Resistance, Sichuan Province had a slightly tangible industrial foundation, while Guizhou and Yunnan provinces mostly remained in the era of agricultural society. After the outbreak of the war, developing the industrial construction of the base area was one of the major tasks of the War of Resistance. At the same time, due to the successive inland migration of national industries from the war zone and the adjacent war zone, the progress of industrial construction in the Southwest is truly inspiring people to have the feeling of "being looked at with new eyes after being separated for only three days!"</p>
<p>Extraordinary construction must implement extraordinary policies to meet extraordinary needs. The policies adopted by the authorities in this regard focus on the control and encouragement of new industrial infrastructure construction. We will explain the actual results of the efforts to re-establish the industrial foundation based on facts below. Here, let’s first talk about the aspect of industrial control. On December 22, 1937, the National Government first promulgated the "Wartime Agricultural, Mining, and Industrial Management Regulations," which classified olefin metal and its products, acids and other compounds—cement alcohol and other solvents, rubber and effective communication equipment, electrical appliances and power equipment, and other heavy industrial products that continued to be designated; vegetable oil cotton, hemp, wool, silk products, paper and its products, printing and education cultural products, medicines, sugar, brewed products, paint, matches, ceramics, bricks, tiles, and other light industrial products that continued to be designated were all placed under the management of the Military Affairs Commission. Later, due to the reform of industrial administration and the concentration of power in the Ministry of Economic Affairs, this regulation did not meet the actual situation. On October 6, 1938, it was revised and changed to the responsibility of the Ministry of Economic Affairs. At the same time, the Ministry of Economic Affairs also established four institutions: the Industrial Department, the Resources Committee, the Industrial and Mining Survey Office, and the Central Industrial Testing Institute, which were responsible for industrial distribution and adjustment, support and promotion, technical management, and examination and improvement. Parallel to the control policies that adjusted the activities of various industrial sectors were rewards and support. For the old industrial sector, the "Industrial Encouragement Law," "Special Industrial Interest Guarantee and Subsidy Regulations," "Revised Extraordinary Period Agricultural, Mining, and Industrial Management Regulations," and "Central Migration Factory Construction Committee" were promulgated in 1938. The main points are nothing more than taking (1) reducing or exempting export taxes and raw material taxes, (2) reducing transportation costs for state-owned effective communication enterprises, (3) giving bonuses, (4) enjoying patent rights, (5) guaranteeing 5% annual interest on the paid-up capital and 6% annual interest on bonds, (6) subsidizing production costs, (7) assisting in the expansion of secondary gold equipment, the supply of materials, the marketing and regulation of products, the supply and regulation of labor, the granting and alternative collection of factory relocation transportation costs, the placement of factory sites and equipment, the collection and use of land, and the solution of power supply, etc. For the construction of emerging industries, in addition to the above-mentioned preferential treatments, the rewards for overseas Chinese investment were given safe guarantees and the issuance of honorary commemorations.</p>
<p>Note: The above-mentioned official regulations on industrial construction are all referenced from the "Chinese and Foreign Economic Yearbook" published by the China National Economic Research Institute. See Chapter 7 of the Yearbook for details: Industrial Economy of Destruction and Construction.</p>
<p>Although the policies are well-thought-out, the degree of success is still determined by the appropriateness of the implementation methods. From the perspective of the actual environment, the implementation methods adopted by the authorities are divided into three routes: heavy industry for national defense industry, light industry interwoven with national defense industry and peace industry, and handicraft industry. Moreover, each route is handled by different competent authorities, and the competition method of division of labor and cooperation between the central and local governments is adopted. The former is engaged in the national defense industry and industries that are larger in scope and beyond the capacity and local economy of the local government; the latter is engaged in light industries interwoven with national defense and peace industries. Taking Guizhou Province as an example, the Guizhou Enterprise Company, which was jointly established with the central government and the public, has a capital quota of 6 million yuan in national currency, but its business scope is not limited to the industrial end. Therefore, the investment methods stipulated in the articles of association are divided into self-management, joint management with other companies, accepting consignment management from other companies or individuals, and managing or acting for businesses that have already been invested and operated by the provincial government. The company can also continue to cooperate with those who are willing to take over all or part of the business that the company has successfully operated. This implementation method undoubtedly supports and promotes the development of various industries from the supply of funds. (Note): The foundation of Guizhou's industry is truly laid on it.</p>
<p>Note: See Chapter 1 of the "Guizhou Economy" published by the China National Economic Research Institute for details: The Natural Endowment and Utilization of the Economy, Section 8: Guizhou Enterprise Company under the Overall Construction Plan.</p>
<p>Rural handicrafts and small industries are promoted by the China Industrial Cooperative Association, which was established with 5 million yuan allocated by the Executive Yuan. The association plans to divide the country into four major regions: Northwest, Southwest, Southeast, and Central China, and engage in the organization of existing rural handicrafts and small industries, adjust the production, transportation, and sales of products in a cooperative manner, mobilize the public, engage in industrial production, and implement this since then, it has become one of the new postures of industrial construction during the war.</p>
<p>The Magnificent Posture of the New Industrial Lineup</p>
<p>National defense industry concerns secrets and cannot be clearly understood by outsiders. Rural handicrafts and small industries are more scattered. Although the "China Industrial Cooperative Association" has been organized, detailed reports cannot be accommodated in the length of this article; however, since China's foundation for the War of Resistance is built on the vast countryside, the development of rural industry and small industry is of great significance.</p>
<p>The light industry that effectively interweaves national defense industry and peace industry is the backbone of the War of Resistance. Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces have been developing in tandem with the national industries that have migrated inland from the war zone and its adjacent areas and the newly constructed industries since the War of Resistance. The following table lists the magnificent posture of the new industry in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces in the Southwest today:</p>

<h3 id="e93">Will Legal Tender Become the New Mark? <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Since the 18th, the black market exchange rate has become unstable once more, and wealthy individuals are vying to purchase gold and foreign exchange, as if the tragedy of the mark and the ruble will soon be repeated in Shanghai. The people are restless and filled with unease. In fact, legal tender is very different from the mark and the ruble of that time. I have witnessed this chaos, which only serves to disturb people's hearts. Therefore, I will present what I see and understand, hoping to clarify the situation.</p>
<p>The decline of the mark during the Great War was due to the German government's excessive issuance of banknotes and subtle collection of people's materials, which caused inflation. Prices were falling, and the excessive issuance of mark notes was so severe that printing could not keep up with the inflation, which is conceivable. On the other hand, legal tender has not only not shown signs of inflation, but is also undergoing a process of contraction. The promotion of exchange clearing certificates by the banking and money industries, the Ma telegram's restrictions on withdrawals, and the payment of public bonds in exchange clearing are all sufficient evidence. So, why is the exchange rate unstable? Please allow me to explain it further.</p>
<p>First, Shanghai's environment is special and cannot be controlled by the government's power, which is why the black market for foreign exchange has emerged. If it could be managed by the government, then the black market would have no way to exist, and there would not be such a large monthly trade deficit. It might even become a port with a trade surplus, increasing the government's foreign exchange reserves. Even the current black market, if no one were to sabotage or manipulate it, would not have fallen to such a low level. The exchange rate is built on the balance of import and export goods. If the value of import goods exceeds the value of export goods, then the demand for foreign exchange is strong, causing the exchange rate to fall. The shortage of foreign exchange will inevitably increase the price of import goods, causing people to automatically reduce consumption or switch to domestic goods, reducing imports. Export goods will inevitably increase due to the falling exchange rate, so after the exchange rate falls, it can automatically reach a certain level and tend to stabilize. In previous years, powerful countries have used currency devaluation as a weapon to increase exports and seize markets, which those with a little monetary knowledge can tell you. However, since the War of Resistance, Shanghai's black market exchange rate has fallen by more than two-thirds, and imports and exports still cannot tend to balance. Why? If we examine the customs figures for the past few months, we will find that the largest imports are cotton and miscellaneous grains, which will make us understand that there must be someone in charge.</p>
<p>Second, in addition to having to repay the trade deficit, some parties in the black market often use legal tender obtained through plunder to arbitrage foreign exchange, and also exchange counterfeit notes from the United Reserve Bank and the China Development Bank. In addition, the monthly customs duties and unified tax revenues are also considerable. So, can we allow foreign reserves to be used infinitely by people to purchase military supplies? This is something that everyone knows cannot be done. Therefore, the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee has to take defensive measures, causing the exchange rate to contract.</p>
<p>In summary, we have determined that the shortage of foreign exchange will not cause legal tender to become like the mark. However, will the shortage of foreign exchange be enough to prevent people from plundering foreign exchange? The answer is definitely no. The source of their legal tender has almost no cost to speak of. Unless the legal tender falls below their cost of plunder in the black market, it will not be possible to completely prevent them, and they will never give up their attempt to plunder regardless of the extent to which the legal tender falls. Therefore, if we want the legal tender to reach a certain level automatically, we cannot prevent them from plundering it. Therefore, the black market for foreign exchange must be restricted and the approach must be changed in order to be effective. Yesterday, foreign exchange trading on the market had invisibly tended to stop, which may be a prelude to cracking down on the black market. However, the exchange rate soon returned from 3.75 pence to 4.375 pence, which seems to indicate that there is a supply again.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3 id="e94">Finance: The Gold Market Was Quiet This Week; It Was Heard That Transactions Outside the Market Were Done at 3,440 Yuan to 3,440 Yuan <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday’s cash spot black market situation: Because it was Sunday, a holiday, there was no formal market quotation. However, it was rumored that transactions were once agreed upon at 3,440 yuan outside the market, which was a slight decrease of 30 yuan compared to the midday closing price on the previous day. In addition, money exchange businesses had received dozens of taels, priced at 3,400 yuan. However, general operators believed that the rumors circulating on the market yesterday that banks would implement measures today to limit weekly withdrawals, and operations, etc. were rumors. If implemented, it would be unimaginable. Therefore, people's hearts were still good. Therefore, if outsiders wanted to enter, they would not do so unless the price was 3,470 yuan. The exchange rate for gold jewelry per tael in silver buildings remained unchanged. Datongxing still hung at 350 yuan, and Xintongxing hung at 348 yuan. There was still no fixed price for purchases. In addition, according to the London telegram on the 22nd, British pure gold increased slightly by half a penny per ounce due to the strengthening of the British pound, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence.</p>
<h3 id="e95">British Indian Silver Prices Were Stable <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>According to the London telegram on the 22nd, the silver market had a few short-sellers covering their positions, and the market was stable. The spot price for large bars of silver recently increased by 0.0625, and the forward price remained unchanged. According to the New York silver telegram, the spot price in the United States remained flat. According to the Bombay silver telegram, the Indian silver market was stable. The spot price increased by 1 anna, the August price increased by 3 annas, and the September price increased by 2 annas. Only 75 transactions were made.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Sugar Market Foreign Sugar Rises Again <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was affected by the tight credit situation, and there was a general feeling that it was better to hold goods than cash. Therefore, the trend tightened again. The guild marked the spot price of No. 24 coarse white sugar up by 8 jiao, with the local firms at 34 yuan 8 jiao, foreign firms at 6 jiao, and transit goods rising back by 1 yuan before and after. Initially, 100 bags were traded at 26 yuan, then rose to 26 yuan 5 jiao for 200 bags. Taikoo Crystal White rose by 1 yuan to 1 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen. West Bank B mark was 37 yuan, CW mark 36 yuan 7 jiao, CX mark 36 yuan 4 jiao, DY mark 36 yuan, HX mark 35 yuan 8 jiao, and H mark Raw Sugar also rose by 1 yuan to 23 yuan. Dutch Raw Sugar spot rose by half a yuan to 27 yuan, while transit goods remained unchanged, with 100 bags traded at 20 yuan. Local Refined White rose by 1 yuan, No. 1 white was 34 yuan, No. 2 was 33 yuan 5 jiao, local Rock Sugar rose by half a yuan, No. 1 Rock Sugar was 38 yuan 5 jiao, and Crystal Clear Rock Sugar was 40 yuan. Only Guangbang domestic sugar had newly arrived white packages, Hainan Raw Sugar was 19 yuan 2 jiao, and ordinary was 18 yuan, totaling over 300 bags. However, high-quality goods were quite tight and unwilling to sell much, it was said.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Metals Tinplate Prices Vary, Sales Hit <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>In the dark market of fluctuating foreign exchange and financial chaos, the metals market is also greatly affected. The prices of various goods have increased successively due to cost factors (generally varying from 20% to 30%), while sales in various markets have stalled. The reason is nothing more than the high prices and sluggish sales of products. Therefore, the intake of various manufacturers (such as can factories, thermos bottle factories, iron printing factories, machine factories, etc.) has greatly decreased compared to the past. Furthermore, due to the impact of war and blockades, the purchasing power of foreign merchants has been greatly affected. Therefore, in this dark market, the trend is so bad and business is so quiet, it is really difficult to imagine. However, the standard price is higher than before, but there is no fixed price in the chaotic market. 200-pound genuine goods are offered at 140 yuan, and some are sold for 130 yuan.</p>

<p>These past two days, due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, the price of gold has soared past the 3,000 yuan mark, a truly shocking piece of news! But thinking about it carefully, if gold rises, everything will rise. Who knows, the value of love will be even more expensive than gold. As the saying goes, "Neither gold nor nobility can buy a beautiful woman's heart," and "An hour of spring night is worth a thousand pieces of gold."</p>
<p>A beautiful young woman in full bloom, once married to a handsome husband with abundant energy and novel ideas, they will surely have deep affection like the sea and happiness like immortals. At the same time, they will have sons and daughters, building a happy family, and life will be so happy! If she marries a sick husband suffering from premature ejaculation, impotence, and incomplete development, even after the blessed wedding, the couple's life will certainly not be happy, or even completely unable to consummate the marriage. This will be like a thunderbolt-like wound in the wife's heart, feeling the emptiness of life and the pointlessness of marriage. At this time, even if the husband uses gold and nobility to win his wife's favor, I am afraid it will be difficult. If effective medicine can cure his illness, it can immediately lead his loving wife into a joyful state, making her suddenly realize the joy of life!</p>
<p>But why do men have this sickness? According to medical conclusions, it must be because of early masturbation and seminal emission or post-marital debauchery and indulgence, consuming too much of the reproductive gland fluid. Therefore, the above symptoms are difficult to avoid. Moreover, if these symptoms are not treated, not only will marital happiness be lost, but there is also the risk of premature aging and endangering life!</p>
<p>According to the millions of case studies of world-renowned doctors and my own practical experience of more than ten years, the only effective medicine for treating the above symptoms is the reproductive gland element preparation "Reproductive Hormone." This preparation is based on the principle of reproductive gland supplementation therapy, extracted from the reproductive glands of strong animals such as apes, gorillas, and sea dogs, and replicated using scientific methods. Therefore, the quality is pure and noble, the effect is certain and great. After taking it, it can produce sperm and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and invigorate blood, nourish nerves, and promote development in one day and night. If you continue to take it for half a month, it will surely cure the above symptoms. Long-term use by middle-aged and elderly people can achieve the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenating. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Hymitol Sperm-Locking Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop the leakage, so that both the root and branch are treated, and the effect is rapid!</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Gu Mengsheng, who got married this spring, suffered from severe premature ejaculation and impotence, and also had seminal emission. Since his marriage, according to Mr. Gu, his wife is still a virgin, and his wife not only hates her husband's incompetence but is sometimes even consumed by anger. Mr. Gu is even more remorseful for his masturbation and indulgence in his youth, which led to today's pain! He sought medical treatment from me, and I prescribed a large amount of "Reproductive Hormone" and "Hymitol Sperm-Locking Tablets" to be taken together. The seminal emission stopped in three days, and he had recovered his happy health in three weeks. Thus, he reunited with his beautiful dream, and his joy was greater than flying!</p>
<h3 id="e100">Prescribing the Right Medicine for Seminal Emission <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Prescribe the right medicine for the disease," and "The right medicine is like opening a lock." This is certainly true. Treating illness is not difficult; failing to find the root cause of the illness is the only difficulty. Knowing the root cause of the illness but having no effective medicine is futile, even for famous doctors! Therefore, medicine and treatment complement each other.</p>
<p>Why do young people suffer from seminal emission? It is nothing more than the following reasons: Masturbation and indulgence; excessive debauchery; congenital weakness or post-illness imbalance; excessive use of the brain or force; and worry and overwork. Among the above reasons, masturbation and indulgence are the most common. Because they damage the sexual nerves and loosen the sperm gate, seminal emission follows. As seminal emission increases, the weakness of the sexual nerves will become more severe, and symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, scattered energy, brain fatigue, forgetfulness, insomnia, and palpitations will follow one another. Such young people not only suffer from many diseases and pains, making it difficult to succeed in studying and learning a trade, but also, because of their unattractive appearance, they are easily abandoned by the opposite sex. Unmarried individuals face the crisis of falling in love, and married individuals are often dissatisfied with their wives, and all kinds of tragedies will unfold in the family! Therefore, patients with seminal emission should seek treatment as soon as possible for the sake of their own future happiness, for the sake of their family, society, nation, and country.</p>
<p>In today's era of medical advancement, we not only know the root cause of seminal emission but also have the invention of effective medicines. What is the effective medicine? It is the globally popular "Hymitol Sperm-Locking Tablets." This medicine is completely adapted to the pathology of seminal emission. After taking it, it can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, allow for peaceful sleep at night, reduce dreams, and seminal emission can be stopped immediately that night. If the above symptoms have already occurred due to seminal emission, you must also take the reproductive gland element preparation "Reproductive Hormone" to nourish the brain and kidneys, sperm and blood, and nerves. In a short period of time, you will surely restore perfect health.</p>
<p>Patient Mr. Zhu Zhigao, 25 years old, masturbated during middle school, and seminal emission began half a year later. Although he barely graduated from middle school, he failed to enter university. He got married last year and had symptoms of premature ejaculation and impotence. Last month, he sought medical treatment from me, and I prescribed "Hymitol Sperm-Locking Tablets" and "Reproductive Hormone" to be taken at the same time. He also received electrotherapy injections. Seminal emission stopped after three days. After three weeks, premature ejaculation and impotence were also cured, and his mind was clear and his energy was abundant, completely different from before.</p>

<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Which man would not want to choose a healthy and beautiful woman to be his life partner? Therefore, if a woman wants to win in the game of love, she must pay attention to her health, especially the development of her breasts!</p>
<p>If a woman's breasts can develop well, with soaring peaks in front of her chest, and matched with a slender body and full hips, the so-called most mysterious and precious curves of a woman are completely revealed. Such a woman, because of the health of her own ovarian function and the exuberance of her metabolism, will inevitably have a cheerful mind and healthy body, revealing a happy expression, and her actions and demeanor will be very lively and her emotions abundant. After marriage, the love between the couple is even more intense, forming a happy family and giving birth to clever children. Not only does she feel satisfied and content, but also relatives, friends, and neighbors envy her. Isn't this the happiest woman in the world? However, in the past, due to various reasons such as masturbation, chest binding, post-illness imbalance, congenital weakness, and the constraints of old ethics and oppressive environments, she suffered from leucorrhea, irregular menstruation, anemia, and tuberculosis. The ovarian function is then destroyed, and the breasts do not develop well, or even if they do develop well, they must gradually wither away, until they are as flat as a man's. Such a woman must be disliked by men, and even after she is past her prime, no one will ask for her hand in marriage, her youth is wasted, and she laments her unfortunate fate! Even if she does marry, she will be disgusted by her husband or even abandoned! The only remedy, according to world-renowned gynecologist Kang Delin and my experience, is unanimously recognized as taking the ovarian preparation "Reproductive Hormone" for women as the most effective treatment. This preparation has noble ingredients and is well-prepared. After taking it, it can nourish ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, adjust menstruation, warm the uterus, and stop leucorrhea in one day and night. If you continue to take it, it can not only make the shriveled breasts become tall and soaring but also redden the cheeks and transform ugliness into beauty. White Turbidity Forum</p>

<p>I have more than ten years of experience in the clinical treatment of white turbidity and have treated no fewer than thousands of people. Many gonorrhea patients often ask me when they seek treatment, "Why won't my white turbidity heal?" Because many patients have experienced a long period of suffering and various treatments (including internal medicine, electrotherapy, injections, and surgery), it is always difficult to cure them completely. They often become discouraged and despondent, and as a result, the old white turbidity, which could have been cured, becomes an incurable chronic disease—is this not trapping the patient in a state of eternal suffering instead of enabling them to recover their health? Let me try to explain the reason: In general, there are approximately three causes of untreated gonorrhea: First, mistakenly taking inferior medicines on the market; second, being mistreated by incompetent and poorly equipped doctors (including misuse of surgery, injections, medication, and electrotherapy, etc.). Third, patients do not know how to maintain their health and recklessly engage in excessive behavior. All of these cause gonorrhea to be difficult to cure for a long time, or, it can be said, make gonorrhea more stubborn after treatment.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to cure old white turbidity, it is necessary to first remedy the above three causes. Diagnose with precise scientific methods, such as ureteroscopy, cystoscopy, and microscopy, to examine the condition. Then, use the Leilinping Flow Electrotherapy invented by German Dr. Le Gena or perform localized radiation current, or insert an electric tube into the urethra to completely destroy all deep or localized gonococci and filter out its toxins (note that general electrotherapy has only a small amount of sterilizing effect and absolutely no filtering effect on lymphatic toxins; readers should pay attention!). Supplement with His's serum, electrical massage, David's new formula of Pu Qi, and specially made autologous vaccines, and treat according to the symptoms. Not only can stubborn chronic lymphorrhea be cured, but also acute and chronic anterior and posterior urethritis, prostatitis, orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, arthritis, etc., can be effectively treated.

<h3 id="e103">The Likes of Essence and Substance <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Ya</p>
<p>Soy sauce has essence, and flavor has substance. Once blended, they become delicious dishes. The wonderful use of "essence" and "substance" is such that ordinary people have endless faith in them!</p>
<p>Song Yue Ke's "Kui Lin Lu": "Since the country takes scholars through examinations, the world takes the learning for passing exams as the priority. Therefore, all books that compile categories, extract items, and summarize outlines that are slightly convenient for review are now abundant. Jianyang bookstores compile monthly and quarterly publications, changing with the times, in order to sell quickly; and the four directions relay and transmit them, often carrying them into the examination hall, trying to dazzle the authorities, which is called bringing forbidden material and is regarded as commonplace." After reading this passage, we immediately have a reaction: not only does soy sauce have essence, but books also have essence; not only does flavor have substance, but learning also has substance. The so-called "books that compile categories, extract items, and summarize outlines" that are convenient for review are the essence of books and the substance of learning. Those scholars engaged in learning for passing exams naturally also have their supreme wonderful uses in "carrying them into the examination hall, trying to dazzle the authorities, which is called bringing forbidden material and is regarded as commonplace."</p>
<p>When the Ministry of Education strictly enforced the middle school graduation examination system, weren't the "books that compile categories, extract items, and summarize outlines" such as the examination guides published by booksellers in order to meet the needs of students' memorization also "abundant"? Weren't many bookworms who tried to make extra money also "compiling monthly and quarterly publications, changing with the times" in order to compete? Now, in these extraordinary times, the examination system has been temporarily suspended. Books such as examination guides on the market are naturally not as rampant as before. But their latent power is still quite strong. Because if you don't "meet" the "exam," you still have to "exam" to graduate. Since there are exams, then a kind of book that guides and facilitates exams will never be abolished. I happened to pass a bookstore, and there were still thirteen or fourteen kinds of "guides" listed in its cabinets; however, they were all old editions and no longer newly compiled. At the same time, things like essences, hundred-day passes, and ten-day passes are more active than before. Judging from the evolution of today's cultural circles, there is already a guide that is easy to memorize or a hundred-day or ten-day pass for self-explanation for every major subject. A group of students no longer need to put in the hard work of "studying behind closed doors" or "burning the midnight oil," and can "know the learning of the world without leaving home." It is really better to compile a "guide" or write a "self-pass" than to build a seven-story pagoda.</p>
<p>Naturally, a book or a kind of learning has its most important parts and its intellectual system. We really cannot criticize those who compile "guides" and "self-passes" and only repeat what others have said for the benefit of later learners. However, the wonderful uses of things like "essence" and substance" in matter is that they dissolve immediately when they meet soup and become delicious. The problem is whether the "essence" and "substance" in books and learning can play a dissolving role as soon as they meet students. Those who compile "guides" and "self-passes" and only repeat what others have said aim to make money; and the students who place these kinds of "essence" and "substance" on their desks and pillows just want to use them to pass the exam or get some small advantages in learning, and there is no question of any melting. In the fourth year of Zhenghe in the Song Dynasty, Huang Qianshan, the academic director of Lizhou Road, once proposed to ban books carried into the examination hall, saying, "In recent years, they have extracted and selected stale words from current essays, distinguished categories, and compiled them into collections for easy plagiarism, which is called passing the examination. Those who are lazy and sluggish often memorize them to deceive the authorities. Reading them seems right, but in the end, they are not rooted in the original learning of the classics. The harm is not small." When the world is turbulent, Qianshan's proposal is inevitably narrow-minded; of course, we are not so ignorant.</p>
<p>However, I believe that since soy sauce has essence and flavor has substance, the world has more delicious food; since books have essence and learning has substance, the world has more rootless scholars; this should be a matter of concern for those who are concerned.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Returning to the Embrace of Dabie Mountain <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>——War Zone Chronicle</p>
<p>Leaving Shangcheng with lingering passion, we marched on the road to entering Anhui. The continuous mountain ranges around us were smiling and welcoming us. What a pleasant trip! Sigua Dun was the first journey, only thirty-five li from the county seat. The road surface was difficult to walk, but it was very flat, but when we encountered a deep stream with jagged rocks, we had to wade through it. The turbulent stream swirled around our ankles. It was such a turbulent torrent. If we didn't stand firm, we would be swept into the vortex; but as long as you have courage and determination, any difficulty can be overcome, let alone wading!</p>
<p>There were only twenty-five sparsely populated households in the whole town of Siguadun. When we arrived at the end of the street, the people immediately gathered from all directions and stared at us with surprised eyes.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? We're doing a good job, right?" An old man with a dry tobacco pipe in his mouth asked with concern, smoke spewing from his nostrils, followed by a fit of coughing and spitting out thick phlegm.</p>
<p>"Very good!" Xiao Shen replied.</p>
<p>He told us that his son and nephew had already been drafted into the army. They were trained in Changsha before, but they didn't know where they were being deployed to now. However, in order to save the motherland, even if they died in battle, it would be very honorable. "Another miracle," I thought. Indeed, the people in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces all have the virtues of simplicity, honesty, and straightforwardness; however, how can the national consciousness be so profound? It turns out that the sowing of seeds cannot but be attributed to the relationship of the past few years, especially the so-called "encirclement and suppression" period. In terms of economy, since the flames of war have been ignited all around, it has directly threatened their lives. Agricultural products stagnating in the countryside, such as miscellaneous grains, hemp, medicinal materials, etc., cannot be sold to the cities due to the disruption of transportation, and everyone will feel who is destroying their lives, and anger, cursing, and hatred will eventually strengthen their political awareness.</p>
<p>After a hearty meal of corn, we continued our journey. Around 3:00 p.m., we began to enter the embrace of Dabie Mountain; winding mountain paths, towering peaks, and strange caves, if it were peacetime, you would have enjoyed them at will. After crossing a mountain, the road became narrower and narrower, and the hillside became almost perpendicular. Looking down at the deep ditch below, I couldn't help but tremble with fear. It was not until the time of "twilight sun in the chaotic mountains" that we arrived at Suxianshi in Anhui Province. Thanks to the hospitality of the local Lianbao Director, we solved the problem of lodging for the night in a dilapidated temple. It happened that the Provincial Education Department's roving lecture team returned from the nearby countryside, filling the three spacious halls. According to the team, "Two months of lecturing has given me a lot of experience. When talking to farmers, the more popular it is, the better, and we must also consider their working hours. It is best to take a casual chat, so that we can touch their heartstrings..." He talked endlessly, concluding that cultural people must return to the countryside. It is useless to hold forums in the city. "It is better to act than to talk," he ended his speech.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Drum <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Bo</p>
<p>What I want to tell you now is the story of a drum, although I am not the best drummer.</p>
<p>My getting to know it was by no means accidental. I knew its name very early; I had spent several dusks raving over its glorious story. I remember one silent midday, my head was sweating, reciting the achievements of my ancestors, when I suddenly thought of the drum. So, I tried my best to use my imagination to portray its appearance. I said, it must at least be brave enough, because I had heard its majestic shouts. I believe it will not have a humiliating encounter, it has resistance to tyranny. Always so ordinary, its movements.</p>
<p>Celebrating my fate, I am now a loyal companion to a drum. It was when the spring breeze took away the withering flowers that I picked up a drum on the beach. Testing its ability with a shell, I smiled proudly. So, I started my own singing, traveling all over the world, exchanging hot sweat for the joy of excitement.</p>
<p>It is the traction of time that I have come here today. Thank you for your warm praise, my drum is even more energetic. Yes, there are many revelations lurking in this simple drumbeat, let you find the magic in the ordinary!</p>
<p>Goodbye! See you again in the homeland's wilderness! I still have to go overseas for a while, drumming and singing.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Who Eats Whose Food <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>We often hear a sentence: "The food you eat is given to you by me."</p>
<p>Those who say this are mostly factory owners, shopkeepers, company managers, and senior officials in institutions, and those who hear this are naturally workers, shop assistants, apprentices, and junior staff, these essential people. The big shots really feel justified and eloquent, and the essential people also agree, bowing and doing their best, dying without regret. They seem to understand each other's position and relationship with each other: the big shots give food to the essential people, and the essential people eat the food of the big shots.</p>
<p>However, among the essential people, there are also some who do not think so. They say that even the most basic pigs, who can't do anything, still use the meat on their bodies to repay the food they eat from humans. The most basic people among humans, such as workers, also work for the factory owners to make money. How have they eaten the food of the factory owners for nothing! The factory owners don't need to be proud of this, and the workers don't need to feel inferior because of this!</p>
<p>Of course, the big shots will also say to a certain essential person, "I only use you and not others. This is how I treat you especially well. You should be grateful to me." The simple-minded essential people will often be grateful to such big shots. But, I think, such big shots will say these words to everyone they employ. Then, what special kindness do they have for someone they employ?</p>
<p>It is better to be honest about things: the position of the big shots is created by the essential people; in other words, although the food of the essential people is given by the big shots, the enjoyment of the big shots, the enjoyment above food, is also given by the essential people. If you pull both sides together, the essential people have not eaten the food of the big shots, the essential people eat their own food. To put it directly: no one has eaten anyone else's food, everyone eats their own food, and even pigs eat their own food!</p>
<p>The only difference is that the essential people are a little more foolish (the correct saying), or their conscience is more balanced (the excessive saying), so they have formed the appearance of being fed by others. According to the principle of "each according to their ability, each according to their needs," they have nothing to be ashamed of, because as I see it, the pigs offer their meat for people to eat, so they also have nothing to be ashamed of for being fed by humans!</p>
<p>I hope everyone will no longer hear the sentence "The food you eat is given to you by me." If anyone wants to say this again, I also hope that the listeners will honestly retort, "The food you eat is also given to you by me!"</p>
<p>Hearing the good news from the army, they open up the way to the front, looking back at the old defenses, far away in the deep mountains.</p>

<p>His hand trembled in the air, then he fell silent.</p>
<p>"I'm not going anywhere with you!" Agushnia interrupted, shaking her head firmly.</p>
<p>"Anywhere... I want to go anywhere... you go too..." Vasika said softly.</p>
<p>"I'm not going anywhere!"</p>
<p>"But, I don't think so... but if you want to go, go ahead."</p>
<p>"No! Already..."</p>
<p>"Is that so? Demon!" Vasika said angrily, "So you were just deceiving me... you're like this now (gesturing as if to throw a stone at his chest)?"</p>
<p>"That's not what I meant..." Agushnia said calmly, "But, to live with you... I don't want to! I'm afraid of you... you are a great evildoer!"</p>
<p>"What are you saying? You've misunderstood me, haven't you?" Vasika cried out unhappily, "Evildoer! You're just a stupid woman... think carefully—evildoer? But among the people here, who isn't fierce? Don't you think so? What's so great about being fierce?"</p>
<p>He interrupted himself, stroking his chest with his uninjured hand, and was silent for a while. Then, with melancholy in his voice and fear in his eyes, he said again:</p>
<p>"Why are you... like that? Evildoer, who isn't an evildoer? Why do you ask me this? Let's go together, Agushnia Semyonovna!"</p>
<p>"Please don't mention it again! I'm not going!" Agushnia insisted on her opinion, suspiciously running away.</p>
<p>Their discussion was interrupted. Moonlight shone into the room, and in the moonlight, Vasika's face looked very pale, his eyes flickering open and closed, forever silently lying in bed. Downstairs, people were jumping, singing, and laughing happily.</p>
<p>Agushnia's loud snores started again. Vasika sighed deeply.</p>
<p>Two more days passed, and the madam found a vacancy in the hospital. The doctor's assistant and a hospital worker came with a patient transport to pick up Vasika. People carefully helped Vasika downstairs. He was looking at the girls crowded at the door.</p>
<p>He couldn't bear to turn his face away, but he didn't say anything to them. (Fourteen)</p>

<p>The Emperor, considering the extensive expenses required for the repair of the Yuanmingyuan, immediately ordered the work to cease. He then considered that the Three Seas, being close to the palace, had palaces and buildings that were still intact and proposed to repair them. The Three Seas are where the Emperor and Empress Dowager would go to relax and play, the area lying between the Golden Turtle and Jade Rainbow. Taiye Pond, formerly known as the West Sea, is located in the Xi'an Inner Gate and is several li in circumference. A stone bridge spans the pond, which is about two xun wide and several hundred steps long. The two banks are arched with brickwork emerging from the water, and the whale-like beasts and balustrades are all carved from white stone. To the east and west stand Huabiao pillars. The eastern one is called Jade Thorn, and the western one is called Golden Turtle. To the north, another bridge extends from Chengguang Hall to Qionghua Island. To the north and south also stand Huabiao pillars, called Accumulated Green and Piled Clouds. Yingtai is to its south, and the Five Dragon Pavilion is to its north. The Banana Garden and Ziguang Pavilion stand opposite each other to the east and west. The tiered roofs curve upwards, and the flying eaves brush the clouds. On both sides of the bank are elm and ancient locust trees, many of which are hundreds of years old. In the pond, duckweed, water lilies, reeds, and algae intertwine in green abundance. Wild birds rest on the sandy islands, swimming and playing in the water. The water and mountain scenery is leisurely and pleasant. In high summer, the water is covered with water caltrops and lotus, looking like embroidery. The fragrance is fragrant and flowing, truly pure and unique. If it is early spring when the ice is just melting, or autumn when the moonlight is clear, or misty clouds, or rainy mornings and snowy nights, the scenery is truly beautiful! People in the palace call the sea south of Yingtai the South Sea, the Banana Garden the Central Sea, and the Five Dragon Pavilion the North Sea. In the cold winter when the ice freezes, flat boards are made of wood with two legs underneath, lined with iron strips. One person pulls the rope in front, and three or four people can sit on it, moving on the ice as if flying, called a "dragging bed." With accumulated snow and lingering clouds, the scenery is even more picturesque. There is a game of throwing balls on the ice, with dozens of people in each team, each with a leader, standing in formation. A ball is made of leather and thrown into the air. When it is about to fall, the group rises to compete for it, and the one who gets it wins. The shoes worn all have iron teeth, which makes them move very quickly on the ice. Sometimes, ministers and others follow the Emperor to tour the West Garden, feasting on boats, with rewards varying according to rank. To the southwest of Taiye Pond is the Ziguang Pavilion, and half a li east is the Banana Garden. Behind it is the Chongzhi Hall, with painted beams, carved ridges, and golden splendor. The ancient pines and green cypresses are coiled and shaded, so that there is no feeling of heat in the height of summer. Other buildings and pavilions are too numerous to mention. In recent years, many have become dilapidated, so this study is respectfully made.</p>

<h3 id="e110">On the Restriction of Private Property of Officials <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Zuoliang</p>
<p>In the seventh issue of this publication, there is an article on the evolution of laws for punishing corruption, which exhaustively lists the laws for punishing corrupt officials from the Qin, Han, Jin, Tang, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties to the Republic of China. It is truly enough to make corrupt officials feel alarmed. However, I believe that this is the criminal law for punishing corruption after it has already occurred, and it is not a way to prevent it from happening in the first place. What is the source of officials' wealth? It comes from the state's salaries. In the national system, it is appropriate to ensure that the salaries are generous enough to support integrity in practice, and at the same time, it is appropriate to set restrictions to prevent gradual corruption. The salaries of officials are based on their rank and have a specific amount. Regardless of the length of service, the amount of salary, it is not difficult to calculate the surplus or deficit, so that they can maintain their integrity and not have to worry about not being able to support themselves. If there is any income that far exceeds their salary, that is due to their position and power, and is not allowed by law, then the source of their property should be investigated. Therefore, if the state does not want to punish corruption, then so be it. But if it wants to punish corruption, it should carefully examine their private property. If there is any income that exceeds their salary, it is a way to get to the root of the problem. Before the Ming and Qing dynasties, the private property of officials was often confiscated by the state and put into the treasury due to criminal relations, so high-ranking officials did not dare to openly possess huge amounts of property. Since the Republic of China, the state has strictly prohibited corruption among officials, and has repeatedly issued warnings, but warlords and high-ranking officials have amassed huge sums of money, claiming to have millions or even hundreds of millions of dollars. And so on down the line, such as directors and chiefs, often become rich in a very short period of time. Although the state has established strict laws, the corrupt people are not afraid, or even regard them as mere formalities, without any value. This is because the most important thing in a crime is evidence. If there is no evidence of accepting bribes, even if it is clear that there is such a fact, it is impossible to prosecute and punish them. It is like hating dampness but letting it reside underneath. Based on my limited understanding, I believe that a law restricting the private property of officials should be enacted in order to clarify the government and complete the great task of national construction. I propose the following principles.</p>
<p>1. All officials, before taking office, should list all of their original property, whether real estate or movable property, and register it with the主管官署(Competent authority), which will then compile the cases and send them to the Audit Council for detailed review. If they are incumbent officials, they should register on the date of implementation of the law restricting the private property of officials.</p>
<p>2. Officials shall not engage in business or compete with the people for profit. If the business is inherited or existed before becoming an official, they should apply to the主管官署(Competent authority) and forward it to the Audit Department for approval before they can continue to operate. However, any business that is related to their official duties or jurisdiction should be absolutely prohibited, and they should be prevented from doing so in the name of their wives, concubines, or children, or using a false name.</p>
<p>3. If the examination results confirm that the operation of a business under a false name or the income obtained from it is an improper gain, and it is discovered after they have left office, it should be confiscated according to law, regardless of how long ago it was.</p>
<p>4. When there is a change in the private property of officials, they should list it as per the above registration; even if there is no change, they should at least list it with the主管官署(Competent authority) once a year, detailing the income and expenditure of their original private property and the surplus of their official salary. Businesses that are allowed to operate should attach a business report, which will be reviewed by the Audit Council.</p>
<p>5. If the audit agency finds that the private property of an official exceeds their official salary, it should carefully investigate the source. If there is suspicion of corruption, the court with jurisdiction should be ordered to investigate.</p>
<p>6. The private property of officials, whether it is from business or accumulated from official salary, and its interest, must be limited to a maximum amount? If it exceeds a certain limit, the excess part should be confiscated in full, and the rank of the official should be differentiated and limited accordingly.</p>
<p>7. The restriction on the private property of officials shall be limited to ten years from the beginning of inheritance after the death of the official subject to the restriction.</p>
<p>The above are just the broad outlines. Other matters that should be stipulated are still to be carefully examined and determined by the legislators.</p>

<p>— Wang Dongjia</p>
<p>Article 251, paragraph 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure stipulates: "The complaint shall be served on the defendant together with the summons for the date of oral argument." The "complaint" mentioned in this provision should naturally be interpreted as the original complaint. If the complaint has already been served on the defendant together with the summons for the date of oral argument, what will be left in the court's file? The "complaint" mentioned here should be changed to a copy of the complaint, otherwise, I cannot resolve my confusion.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Article 436, paragraph 2 of the same law stipulates, "If a party waives the right to appeal verbally when the judgment is pronounced, it shall be recorded in the record of oral argument. If the other party is not present, the record shall be served."</p>
<p>The "record of oral argument" mentioned in this provision is also inappropriate. After the conclusion of oral argument before the judgment, the record of oral argument should not be used for any further records. Since the waiver of the right to appeal is neither oral argument nor after the conclusion of oral argument, why should it be recorded in that record? Is it not difficult to understand? It seems that it would be appropriate to create a separate record of the pronouncement of judgment.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The meaning of oral argument can be broad or narrow. In the broadest sense, it refers to all acts by the parties, including statements, legal and factual claims, as well as procedural directions, evidence investigations, and declarations of judgments by the court. Narrowly defined, it excludes the investigation of evidence and the declaration of judgments. In the narrowest sense, it refers specifically to the procedural acts of the parties on the date of oral argument. Article 213 of our Code of Civil Procedure stipulates the matters that should be recorded in the record of oral argument, which is quite broad in scope, and adopts the broadest meaning. Therefore, Article 436, paragraph 2 of the same law is still acceptable.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Discussion on the Issue of Damages for Breach of Promise <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Renhao</p>
<p>A betrothal agreement is a preliminary agreement made by a man and a woman with the intention of getting married in the future. The making of a betrothal agreement does not require any particular form; it is sufficient that there is a mutual expression of intent between the two parties. However, except for men under the age of seventeen and women under the age of fifteen, which are expressly prohibited by law, and minors who should obtain the consent of their legal representatives, the betrothal agreement should be made by the man and woman themselves (Civil Code Articles 972, 973, 974). If it is not made by the parties themselves or has not obtained the consent of both parties, the betrothal agreement shall be invalid (see Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 1174 of the 23rd year). Regarding the validity of a betrothal agreement, Article 975 of our Civil Code clearly stipulates that "a betrothal agreement cannot be forcibly enforced." Since the forcible execution of a person's body is practically difficult and still cannot achieve the purpose of marriage, courts can only use peaceful means to persuade in cases of breach of promise (see Dali Yuan Judgment No. Shangzi 615 of the 9th year, Supreme Court Judgment No. Shangzi 15, 5 of the 19th year). Since a betrothal agreement cannot be forcibly enforced, it would not be fair if one party could arbitrarily breach the agreement after it has been made, causing damage to the other party. Therefore, our Civil Code has Articles 977, 978, and 979, which make the party at fault responsible for compensating the other party for the damages suffered, in order to protect the betrothal agreement and avoid affecting public order and good morals in society. There are two situations in which damages are awarded for breach of a betrothal agreement, which will be described separately below.</p>
<p>(1) Compensation for rescission of a betrothal agreement: Compensation for rescission of a betrothal agreement means that if one party to the betrothal agreement requests rescission because the other party has one of the statutory grounds for rescission (Civil Code Article 976), and suffers damages as a result, they may request compensation for the damages suffered from the other party at fault (Civil Code Article 977). The so-called damages here refer specifically to active or passive damages to property (comparative interpretation of Civil Code Article 979, paragraph 1).</p>
<p>(2) Compensation for breach of a betrothal agreement: Breach of a betrothal agreement means the unjustified failure to fulfill the betrothal agreement. Since the betrothal agreement cannot be enforced, one party may arbitrarily breach it and disregard it. The protection of the betrothal agreement is practically non-existent. Therefore, Article 978 of our Civil Code stipulates that "If one party to a betrothal agreement breaches the agreement without the reasons in Article 976, they shall be liable for damages caused to the other party." This type of damage is not limited to damage to property; even if it is psychological damage, a reasonable amount of compensation may be claimed (Civil Code Article 979).</p>
<p>In summary, although rescission of a betrothal agreement and breach of a betrothal agreement both involve non-fulfillment of the betrothal agreement, the liability for damages borne by the party at fault is clearly different in severity. The legislator must have thought that the situation of unjustified failure to fulfill a betrothal agreement is more reprehensible than rescission of a betrothal agreement with statutory grounds, so they increased the liability, making them responsible for compensating for the other party's psychological damage as well. However, since both situations make the preparatory acts for the betrothal agreement futile for the innocent party, causing psychological pain and resulting in tangible and intangible damages, it seems inappropriate to have such a difference in the liability for damages, even if there is some theoretical justification. It will create many obstacles in application and is easily exploited by cunning individuals. For example, if one party to a betrothal agreement suddenly regrets it after the agreement has been made, but the other party does not have any of the situations specified in Civil Code Article 976 and cannot legally rescind the agreement, and also knows that unjustified breach of the betrothal agreement will result in compensation for the other party's property and psychological damage according to Civil Code Articles 978 and 979, then even if they intend to rescind the agreement, they do not express it to the other party, but instead engage or marry someone else, or commit adultery with someone else, deliberately creating one of the statutory grounds for rescission in Civil Code Article 976, so that the other party has no remedy other than rescinding the betrothal agreement. When rescinding the betrothal agreement, they can only claim compensation for property damage (Civil Code Articles 977, 979), which requires solid proof of the exact amount of damage and is limited in number. The breaching party is then able to carry out their cunning plan to avoid the heavier liability, which is unfair both in terms of reason and feeling. This type of situation is even more reprehensible than unjustified breach of a betrothal agreement, but the liability is reduced. Is this the original intention of the legislation? Therefore, it seems that the phrase "foregoing situation" in Article 979, paragraph 1 of our Civil Code should be changed to "foregoing two articles," so that when the party at fault rescinds the betrothal agreement by violating one of the statutory grounds listed in Article 976, they must also bear the responsibility for compensating for psychological damage to the innocent party. Some may say that if this is modified, it will certainly serve as a warning to the general cunning people, but it would seem inappropriate to force the parties who only have one of the situations listed in Article 976 and rescind the betrothal agreement to increase their liability. In my opinion, from Civil Code Article 977, if the party at fault has one of the statutory grounds for rescission and also has considerable fault, causing damage to the innocent party, then it is not too much to order them to also bear the compensation for psychological damage. This can make the general public think more before making a betrothal agreement, so that they do not act rashly, and after the betrothal agreement is made, they do not dare to arbitrarily create reasons for rescinding the betrothal agreement, so that the betrothal agreement can be protected and there will be no difficulties or obstacles in enforcement, ensuring the public order and good morals of society. This is where it lies. My humble opinion, I do not know what is right, I hope that the experts will correct me.</p>

<h3 id="e113">Key Points of Criminal Rulings of the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Key points of criminal ruling (No. Hu Shengzi 1 of the 27th year), Although the court's handling of a case has caused outside misunderstanding due to the parties or lawyers touting outside, it cannot be said that the court's trial will therefore be difficult to be fair, which is not the reason for transferring jurisdiction listed in the latter part of Article 10, paragraph 2 of the Criminal Procedure Law. Key points of criminal ruling (No. Hu Shengzi 2 of the 27th year), The location of the defendant's crime belongs to the occupied area, and the original jurisdictional court cannot exercise its powers. If there is a situation in Article 10, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, it should be transferred to the Special District Court for jurisdiction after the ruling by the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court in accordance with the 指令(Instruction) No. 1270 of the Judicial Yuan on October 15 of the 27th year.</p>
<p>Key points of criminal ruling (No. Hu Shengzi 3 of the 27th year), Because the original jurisdictional court has traffic blockage and cannot transfer the prisoner, the Special District Court should transfer jurisdiction to the Special District Court after the ruling by the Shanghai Special District Branch of the Supreme Court in accordance with the 訓令(Instruction) No. 746 of the Judicial Yuan on July of the 27th year.</p>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(Question) A has a son B, who married C and has four children. B then married D as a concubine in the 17th year of the Republic of China and rented a house to live with D, and had four children. Now A intends to divide the land he owns equally among his grandchildren; then (1) Can A divide the property in advance while he is still alive? (2) After the division of property, will the inheritance of each grandchild begin? (3) Is there a name for concubine in the current Civil Code? (4) Can concubine not be recognized? (5) Do the children born to D have the right to divide the property? (6) Can the children of C not recognize the children born to D as siblings? (7) Can B bringing D into the house be considered as concubine or cohabitation? (Ling Zuoying)</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) Yes. (2) Since B is still alive, the inheritance of his children has not yet begun. (3) No. (4) Yes. (5) The children of B, regardless of whether they are born to C or D, have the right to inherit the property donated by A. (6) No. (7) House...(Wu Guangding)</p>
<p>(Question) A has three mu of land and hires tenants to cultivate it. Now, due to rent arrears, after a court judgment, the tenant B was forced to pledge to return the land in court, but the pledge did not mention "transferring together with the proceeds from the land." Now that the wheat harvest is approaching, but the wheat in the field was planted by B. (A) Can I directly harvest it? Also, the bean planting season is approaching, and B is still sowing seeds in (A)'s field. Can I stop him? The specific questions are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Can A directly go to the field to harvest? If B forcefully harvests, can I sue him for robbery?</p>
<p>(2) If I cannot harvest, do I need to apply to the court?</p>
<p>(3) How can I stop B from sowing seeds in A's field? Is his action illegal?</p>
<p>(Answer) According to local custom, the wheat planted by B should still be harvested by B. However, since B has pledged to return the land, B may no longer plant beans. If B forcefully plants, A may stop him. According to local custom, unless there is a special situation, the small harvest should be harvested by the previous planters, and the large harvest should be sown by the subsequent planters at the appropriate season, and neither should interfere with each other (Yi).</p>
<p>(Question) A is friends with B and introduces his adult younger sister to B as a friend. Over time, B and A's sister jointly ask A to get engaged. A's third younger brother objects because his sister was betrothed to someone by her parents when she was four years old and received four 洋(foreign) dollars (or twelve dollars). Now A's sister is already an adult, and both parents have passed away. Because she is not satisfied with the marriage arranged by her parents, she is unwilling to marry. After the war broke out, the parents of the engaged family are still in Shanghai, but the man himself is nowhere to be found and there is no information. There are the following questions: (1) Can A's sister make her own marriage decision? (2) How should A's third younger brother's objection be handled? (3) If the parents of the previously engaged family interfere, what law should be used to deal with it? (4) Can the parents of the previously engaged family demand compensation for the engagement fee from B? (5) Is B and A's sister guilty of engagement, cohabitation, or marriage? (6) If they get engaged or married, and A acts as the matchmaker, without asking someone else to act as a matchmaker or witness, is it allowed? (Zhao Zhenghe)</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) Since A's sister is already an adult, she can make her own marriage decision. (2) A's younger brother has no right to object to the marriage of his adult sister. As for how to deal with it, it is a factual issue and cannot be answered speculatively. (3) If A's sister's parents arranged a betrothal agreement for her without her consent, or without her subsequent ratification, the betrothal agreement is invalid by law, and the parents of the other party cannot interfere. (4) If the betrothal agreement is invalid, both parties have an obligation to restore the original state. (5) Whether there is guilt should be determined based on whether the act constitutes a crime, and cannot be answered speculatively. (6) There is no explicit prohibition in law for A to be the matchmaker or witness for the marriage of A's sister (Huang).</p>

<h3 id="e114">Eternal Friends <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>— Yuqie</p>
<p>Starting today, the Shanghai amateur drama circle will hold a charity performance for a week at the Golden Grand Theatre. This large-scale joint performance is not only a charitable act, but also leaves a glorious historical mark on the drama movement of the "isolated island." Today's performance is "Eternal Friends" by the Yeying Drama Society, and Mr. Yuqie is the director of the play. -Editor</p>
<p>"Eternal Friends" is the work of my friend, and its performance is entirely due to several friends. It can be said that this script, from writing to performance, is the result of research by friends together. Speaking of directing, there is basically no director. We just hope that through the efforts of a few friends, we can gain more friends, and eternal friends.</p>
<p>Because we expect to gain eternal friends, we will accept both praise and condemnation from friends with a smile, which is what we should do in terms of human relationships.</p>
<p>I often think that there are three fears in performing a play: first, fear of insufficient understanding of the script; second, fear of unconvincing performance; and third, fear of disharmony with the audience's feelings. The author of this script also participated in performance guidance, so we have no so-called lack of understanding. Since there are no grand and amazing sets in the play, and the characters in the play are all very ordinary people, there is no question of whether they are convincing or not. In fact, since it is neither ancient nor foreign, there is no need to worry about harmony with the audience's feelings. Under these circumstances, we should not talk about difficulties, hardships, effort, or spending money. But at the same time, we also think that easy things are difficult to do well, just like when we write essays in school, easy topics are hard to get good grades on. One is that the teacher expects too much from us, and the other is that we ourselves are too lacking.</p>
<p>The theme of this script is very simple: two men love one woman. The author told me before the script was even written that he was preparing to write a play about two men loving one woman. At that time, I thought that there would probably be a duel scene inside, and that this kind of tense and exciting scene would definitely be good to watch. Or it wouldn't be a battle of strength, but a battle of wits, using all kinds of novel designs to attack and defend, which would also be enough to make people thrilled. Later, I thought that maybe it would be a tragedy, with a scene of parting and death. Maybe it would be a comedy, with a gentleman's agreement, making a good match. Who knew that the author would not use tension and excitement, thrills, or sadness or lightness to openly stimulate the audience's emotions. He suppressed the emotions of tension and excitement in his heart. He hid the thrilling things in his bones. Sadness is lurking, and lightness is a pretense. Joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, love, and hate are all manifestations of life's discord, hypocrisy, coldness, and ruthlessness. This is a play where there is no love everywhere, but love emanates from the depths of the heart. From this, we know that the author used extremely ordinary plots to illustrate life's discord, hypocrisy, and coldness. He used extremely ordinary words to bring out the joy and sorrow hidden in the depths of the heart. He can be said to have written a good article on an easy topic. However, the friends who were in charge of the performance sometimes felt that easy words were not easy to say, and easy actions were not easy to do.</p>
<p>During rehearsals, I was joking with a group of performing friends, so I know very well that they would never easily let go of words that were easy to say or actions that were easy to do. Sometimes they felt satisfied with themselves, and sometimes they couldn't help but feel difficulties. However, when we encountered difficulties, we had a wonderful solution, which was that we all felt a strong interest in a song written by Mr. Chen Gexin. We often had special inspiration when we were singing "Evening Breeze Song" softly. Several difficulties were solved unintentionally after singing "Evening Breeze Song." In addition, when we felt tired during rehearsals, "Evening Breeze Song" also lifted our spirits and enhanced our activity. So, to be honest, what was the biggest help in rehearsals? That was "Evening Breeze Song." Who should we thank? That is Mr. Chen Gexin.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Summer Children's Health Association <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Eleven free clinics throughout the city; Chinese and Western doctors enthusiastically join voluntary clinics</p>
<p>Almost half of the two-month summer vacation has passed, time flies so fast. In another month, schools will start again. During the summer vacation, most children do not go to school and stay at home every day, leading a relatively dissolute life. As a result, due to lack of restraint in food and improper adjustment of clothing, they may get sick. As everyone knows, summer is a season prone to diseases, especially this year's summer, with two hurricanes causing erratic weather, making it particularly easy to get sick.</p>
<p>The Private School Friendship Association of this city, in order to promote children's health, decided to host a Summer Children's Health Association during this year's summer vacation. The work originally planned to be carried out can be divided into six items. The first step is to start with medical and pharmaceutical work. Eleven free clinics will be set up throughout the city to provide free medical treatment for children's diseases. Moreover, as a result of prior contact between the association and Chinese and Western pharmacies, sick children can enjoy special discounts when purchasing medicine.</p>
<p>Starting from the 24th, the eleven free children's clinics will officially open, specializing in the diagnosis and treatment of sick children. The Friendship Association has printed 20,000 free treatment vouchers in advance, which will be distributed to various schools for distribution to students. People from all walks of life can also go to various clinics to obtain them if they have sick children at home. This can reduce the medical burden on the general public and at the same time improve children's health. Moreover, it is not limited to school children, but also ordinary out-of-school children can enjoy the right to free medical treatment and cheap medicine.</p>
<p>Although it is free medical treatment, the Chinese and Western doctors hired are quite well-known. Xiao Tuian, executive member of the National Medical Association, serves as the director of medical and pharmaceutical affairs. There are more than 40 other enthusiastic doctors who are willing to provide free treatment for children in the city. The locations of the free clinics are temporarily set at eleven places, scattered in every corner of the concession. The addresses of each clinic are: (1) Private School Friendship Association, 2nd Floor, 856 Beijing Road; (2) Renwen Middle School, Yanping Road, Connaught Road; (3) Beili Ren Primary School, Changping Road, Gordon Road; (4) Zhenggong Primary School, Nanyao Kou, Hart Road; (5) Hujiang Primary School, Lane 146, 146 North Zhejiang Road; (6) Lehua Middle School, intersection of North Henan Road, Avenue Edward VII; (7) Municipal Middle School, 64 Wuhu Road; (8) Renhe Primary School, Sanchengfang, Mabel Road; (9) Yuansheng Primary School, Deqing Lane, Moore Road; (10) Xinsheng Primary School, opposite Nanjing Grand Theater, Avenue Edward VII; (11) Danmin Primary School, Lane 939, Xinzha Road. Sick children can seek medical treatment nearby.</p>
<p>Indeed, the current standard of living is so high, and the general public is under severe pressure. In particular, the consultation fees for doctors are frighteningly expensive, and the prices of medicines are also particularly high. Poor families often cannot afford medical treatment when their children are sick, and they are left to fate. (Not only children, but also adults are like this.) There are probably many innocent children who die every year because they do not seek medical treatment for their illnesses. Children are the future masters of the country. The death of one child today means that the country will lose a share of its vitality in the future. Therefore, promoting children's health is an important task. And the Private School Friendship Association's organization of the Summer Children's Health Association and the establishment of free children's clinics are worthy of our praise. However, the writer deeply hopes that in addition to medicine, the association should also carry out active work on guiding children's lives in accordance with the principles of health and hygiene conditions, so that children in the city can benefit doubly. That would be a great blessing to mankind!</p>
<h3 id="e116">Daughter of China <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>— Si Hua</p>
<p>"King of Chinatown"</p>
<p>Paramount production, Cathay Theatre screening</p>
<p>Anna May Wong has played in many films that insulted China. This is obviously because American screenwriters lack a deep understanding of China, and Anna May Wong herself is also very isolated from the current situation of her motherland, so that "opium smoking" has become a characteristic representing China. In fact, this is not a Chinese specialty, but a "gift of civilization" that the great powers respectfully sent to us with the "courtesy" of war!</p>
<p>However, this kind of peculiar idea has finally been broken in civilized minds. China not only knows that gunpowder can be used to make firecrackers, but also knows how to use it to make weapons to resist aggression. The robbers who massacre and plunder are not Chinese, but those fascist countries that threaten world security. Such a situation placed in front of American screenwriters no longer allows them to arbitrarily describe China as a "savage ancient country." Naturally, Anna May Wong's personal experience in her motherland has also corrected her erroneous views on her motherland to some extent.</p>
<p>"Daughter of China" is not a film aimed at the current situation in China, but it makes us very happy that it does not arbitrarily slander China; moreover, its ending also encourages Chinese people studying medicine in the United States to return to their motherland to serve! Really, how many medical doctors who have been gilded in the United States are willing to go to the front line to serve the wounded soldiers? It is good enough not to mistreat poor patients. The screenwriter of "Daughter of China" strongly advocates taking responsibility for patients in this regard, so as to fulfill the duties of a doctor.</p>
<p>In terms of the entire script, it cannot be said to be a good work. The story is so plain, and the technique of compilation lacks drama.</p>
<p>The performance of the play is not tense enough, and the director should bear a great responsibility. At least in the two scenes of "assassination" and "cracking the case", there could have been a very stimulating atmosphere, but now it has passed by very calmly. Moreover, the director's old impressions of China have not been completely eliminated. For example, when depicting Chinese people celebrating the New Year in the United States, they are still wearing melon hats and mandarin jackets, and they are still playing dragon lanterns and setting off firecrackers. When depicting the demeanor of Chinese people, it is always inevitable to be a bit dull.</p>
<p>Anna May Wong's acting skills are still the same as before, smooth and steady, without using facial expressions and body movements, and lacking emotional expression. Akim Tamiroff plays Badulin, although he is very experienced, he cannot express the demeanor of a rogue. Sidney Toler is the successor to Chen Charlie. Here, he plays a doctor named Lin Zhang - Anna May Wong's father. His makeup is quite similar to that of a Chinese elder, and his facial expressions also have a Chinese flavor, but his movements are sometimes inevitably Westernized, such as hugging his daughter affectionately. That Philip Hahn is still stiff and eccentric, with no progress at all.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Thousands of Families Cooperate in Rural Areas; Billions of Miles of Waves Fly Over the Sea</p>
<p>But why is it that among the same human beings, some eat well and some eat poorly? Why is it that the dog of a rich family is more nutritious than the child of a poor family? Why is it that a certain lady in Shanghai raises a cat, puts it in a silk quilt in winter, and even uses a hot water bottle to warm its bed? But the people in the disaster areas of southern Hebei and northern Shandong can only eat when they are fifteen or sixteen years old, and then they can work. In the past, some autocratic dictators often said, "Don't want butter, just want cannons." But later, the cannons couldn't move. Why? Because there were no people who had eaten butter to move them, and the cannons were all rusted. For this reason, our authorities and the people attach great importance to the people's food. On the one hand, with regard to the production of grain, we not only seek to increase the quantity, but also improve the quality. In the interior of various provinces, many agricultural schools, rice and wheat experimental fields, and agricultural cooperatives have been established. In recent years, agricultural talents from coastal provinces have gone to the interior. Even the two old friends' sons of Village Chief Zhu in Free Village, who know a little about the organization of collective farms, have been hired by Henan. Secondly, we must talk about fuel. Because of various developments in New China, the most widely used fuel is liquid fuel, such as kerosene. The development of aviation and the opening of highways are increasing day by day, which is quite remarkable. Moreover, because China's own kerosene production is temporarily insufficient, it has to rely on the United States and the Soviet Union. Therefore, while trying to increase sources of income, it also has to reduce expenditure. Fortunately, this is used in the most advanced materials. In other places, other fuels can be used to replace it. Even among other liquid fuels, there are many invented vegetable oils. In addition to liquid fuel, we must talk about coal. Coal is China's richest resource, and people have always been envious of China's coal. Even in Shanxi Province alone, you say it can be used for hundreds of years, he says it can be used for thousands of years, but these are all nonsense. (162)</p>

<p>Because of the misunderstanding of my article "Beware of Fake Stamps," it has attracted the attention of many people, and I am grateful that Mr. Youzhi has corrected it. This misunderstanding is indeed rare for me, but I must state the reasons for considering it fake:</p>
<p>I occasionally used a Hong Kong version of the stamp and did not pay attention to it at first. When I used it, I was rejected by several stores. This could not help but make me suspicious, so I wrote the article "Beware of Fake Stamps." This was entirely out of enthusiasm and had no other intention, but it caused misunderstandings from all walks of life. I cannot shirk the blame for negligence. Now I respectfully express my apology to the editor and Mr. Youzhi.</p>

<p>Buddha's Note: Mr. Yang Wuyang of Yushan is skilled in poetry, calligraphy, and painting. This poem was written before the war when he was selling paintings, hence the words "rice, oil, and salt are not related at all." Now he has taken refuge in Shanghai and lives in a rented room. Although he wants to be unrelated, he cannot. However, the fear of not having clean soil in the world has become a prophecy, alas!</p>
