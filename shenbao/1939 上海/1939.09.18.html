<p>社評</p>
<h3>所期望於今日之日本</h3>
<p>中國於積弱久亂之餘，披荆斬棘，革故鼎新，纔見曙光熹微，坦途在望，顧乃强鄰嫉妬，遽以暴力侵凌，登堂入奧，得寸進尺，駸駸乎將席卷神州；卒使此國此族，不得不忍慘痛，冒鋒鏑，迄今猶在挣扎苦鬭之中。其時，日本維新逾六十載按自一八六八年天皇明治登極始以迄一九三〇年計閱六十三年內則勵精圖治，整軍經武，外則戰勝俄德，頭角崢嶸，旣躋於世界强國之林矣；誠使遠矚高瞻，居仁由義，扶翼弱小，協和鄰邦，則天與人歸，儼然遠東盟主，媲美於美洲美國可也；顧乃狼子野心，蓄意兼併，驅其子弟，竭其財富，遂致淪陷泥淖而不克自拔。當其始也，各國若能感念國際正義之必須申張，黷武侵略之不容破例，運用國聯盟的之原則，實施九國公的之保障，發揮締盟立的之神聖義務，出以抑强制暴之有效行動，則雷霆萬鈞，必能糾正錯誤，而懲一儆百，亦得遏止亂萌；顧乃因循觀望，虛事委蛇；終於各國權益俱受侵蝕，抑且國際秩序自此蕩然；歐洲當前戰禍，亦由强暴，遠東實開風氣之先，固淵源有自者也。嗚呼，星火起於遼甯，自一九三〇年九月十八以迄今年今日，整九年矣；回溯旣往九年之國際擾攘，想像而今而後之禍結兵連，孰能己於無窮慨歎耶！</p>
<p>繫鈴解鈴，非異人任；能發能收，則惟可語之於大智大勇。原中日戰禍之責任，自始即在日本，世論譴責，衆口一辭；及至今茲，中國犧牲一切以蘄求者，絕非報讐雪恨，而僅光復河山，保全主權，但至日軍撒退之日，便是握手言歡之時；是以今後之樞紐，尙在日本也。顧日本之智勇何似乎？一週之前，日本猶為調整其侵華軍隊之機構，加强其侵華軍隊之指揮，特設總司令；三五日前，日本發動全新攻勢之計謀，喧傳遐邇；北方日本兵車絡繹，調遣頻繁；日艦對溫州海口，復有即行封鎖之說；凡此軍事方面之徵象，皆所以說明賡續其侵略。日本新任首相阿部，日前標揭政綱，舉彼外交以及國內行政財政之重心，悉以應付所謂對華事件為本；而於所頤使之報紙雜誌之輿論，猶蒙蔽其人民之耳目，麻醉其人民之性靈，而鞭策以追求迷夢中之侵略大願；此自日本內部之動態觀之，依然為九年來一貫作風，抑且變本而加厲焉。總之，期以幡然改圖，固猶渺無端倪，蓋彼距所謂大智大勇遠矣。况隔昨又得蘇聯與之簽訂停止邊界敵對行動之協定，允使日本寬弛其所感受於蘇聯方面之威脅；而蘇聯昨又突然宣告遣兵征略波蘭，驟使歐戰有接近世界大戰之觀；是蘇聯又以其事實行動告慰日本以無虞於蘇聯。此由於蘇聯最近之態度關係，殆將刺激日本之侵略意識，使之愈益昂進矣。於是言之，九年之期間，僅為星火燎原之過程；而今年今日，非特無一較勝於當時，抑且混亂之質量愈廣大愈嚴重矣。</p>
<p>惟混亂質量之愈廣大愈嚴重，竊以為關於中日與遠東之今日與今後，愈需要各方之冷靜考慮；蓋在廣大而嚴重之混亂之中，中日兩國究處何種地位？在他日解決混亂之際，中日兩國究有何種分量？此所謂地位與分量，旣有關兩國今後數十年數百年之禍福利害，則所以決定此地位分量者，將聽任之於情感欲念奔放之所至乎？聽任世界波濤激盪之所至乎？抑訴之本身之智慧，自主圖謀地位之加高，分量之加重乎？此在中國，答案至簡單明瞭；即凡百以國族為本，以國族為先；對於侵略，惟有答以抗戰，以保國族。國族旣卓立，而外來之侵略威脅又復消失，則中國在世界混亂之中，當然地位加高而分量加重。侵略一日不消失，抗戰當然一日不停止。謂不應抗戰者，祗有兩說：日中國甘滅亡，日日本非侵略。謂甘滅亡，事理所必無。謂非侵略，則決非日本在今日以前之一切行動與理論所得而强辯也。至此時會，至此情况，而中國情甘承認之為非侵略，則於表示情甘滅亡之外，絕無他義。至此時會，至此情况，而日本猶欲强辯之為非侵略，則於表示決心繼續侵略之外，絕無他義。抑當前亟需冷靜考慮者，決非日本在今日以前是吾侵略之問題；乃為世界混亂之質量旣嚴重而廣大，則日本在此混亂之中，若繼續侵略，將加高地位乎，抑終將減低地位乎？將以繼續侵略加重分量乎，抑以繼續侵略而減輕分量乎？我人不信日本於冷靜考慮之餘，乃得與我人相反之結論；然求其行動式符其結論，則有待於大智大慧，常機立斷，毅然放棄其侵略。</p>
<p>安得於此紀念侵略之今日，恰為今後年年此日，日本放棄侵略之紀念日乎！</p>

<h3>西綫首次大戰　德軍反攻受重創　分三路進攻均未得逞　法軍有控制薩爾河勢</h3>

<p>重慶　參政會第四决大會、蔣議長致開會詞、原文如下、張副議長、各位參政員同人、自從本會第三决大會閉慕以後、這半年中間、抗戰建國的工作、的確有很大的進步、而國際形勢的急劇變化、於我們抗戰建國的進行、更有非常的發展、今天本會舉行第四决大會、正值歐戰發生的時候、各位同人所最關心的、當然是如何適應這個新局勢、來執行我們抗戰國策的問題、中正特將我們此决會議所最應注重的幾個要點、簡單的向各位陳述、我認為歐洲發生戰事以後、我們對於抗戰建國的工作、更可以進一層加强我們全國奮鬥的精神、我們要自信中國抗戰勝利、對今後這個大時代和新世界、將有更偉大的貢獻、同時耍認識當此重大關頭、眞要格外謹愼、</p>
<p>格外努力把握重點、奠定根基、集中力量、使時間精力沒有一絲一毫的浪費、使國家在抗戰中、一切實施都能迎頭趕上、和最後勝利的目的相配合、因此我認為當前最切要的幾件事是、（一）集中人才建設後方、（二）加强軍事爭取勝利、（三）注意國際形勢推進戰時外交、</p>
<p>集中人才建設後方</p>
<p>從第一點集中人才建設後方來說、我們要達到抗戰目的、必須鞏固我們抗戰的根據地、必須完成後方各種經濟產業政治文化、允其是地方自治等等的建設、以强固我們抗戰的本身、健全我們建國的基礎、無論國際變化和時代演進如何迅速、而這是我們惟一的根本問題、我們中國無論在任何情况之下、深信必能貫澈抗戰國策、粉碎敵人侵略野心、得到最後勝利但是惟一的要件、就非得從速充實我們自力奮鬥的國力不可、講到後方建設、當然任何省份都是同樣的重要、但凡事應有一個重點、我們開始建設的區域、應該是在西北與西南各省、而川康為西北和西南的中心地區、更為重要、我們在上一决開會的時候、決定設立川康建設期成會、同時組織川康建設視察團、這幾個月來、各位參政員同人不憚溽暑、不辭跋涉、</p>
<p>遍歷川康各地、一面考察、一面宜傳、對地方政府和民衆、給予以莫大的鼓舞、同時搜集了許多很切實豐富的材料、怎麽樣利用這個寳貴的收穫、來推進我們後方的建設、、是這一次大會所要特別討論的一個主題、諸位要儘量貢獻、我相信政府必能充分採納、談到建設、首先要有適當的人才、我們參政會是集合全國優秀賢智之士的總機關、以各位參政員作中心、我們一定能將全國的人才集中一起、來推進一切的建設、目前眞是中國爭存亡決生死的關頭、凡我國人、有一分供一分力量、要為國家來貢獻、我盼望各位同人、不但在開會期間作成良好的決識案、還要在開會以後、竭盡心力號召國人、聲應氣求、推舉賢能、協助政府來完成抗戰建國必需的一切建設、這是第一點、</p>
<p>加强軍事爭取勝利</p>
<p>其次就加强軍事來說、自從上一决大會閉幕以後的軍事經過、另有詳細報告、現在簡單扼要的說、道六個月中間、除了我們南昌陣地撤退以外、敵人不但毫無所得、而且他連續受到很大的打擊、敵人不但沒有進展、而且比之半年以前、還要後退、例如在山西、敵人以八個師團先後攻我們太行山和中條山脈、但自晋城被我軍克復以後、他的計劃就完全粉碎了、在鄂北他企圖攻我南陽襄樊、想消滅我們第五戰區的軍隊、結果反被我軍消減、祗可退守到信陽至漢口的鐵路綫上、不敢再犯雷池一步、在長江以南、敵軍本想從南昌直取長沙、結果不但不能進取、而最重要的高安重鎮、也反被我軍克復了、其他在廣東從化·新會·潮州·等地、他也是屢得屢失消耗了極大的兵力、總之無論在北戰揚、東戰塲、與南戰塲、都證明了敵人的兵力愈用愈絀、可以說我們自從漢口撤退以後、我方軍事更形穩固、我在去年會經預告國人、我們以後持久抗戰的戰塲、要在平漢與粤漢路錢以西地區、更有勝利的把握、這半年來、已有事實的證明了、今天可以實在報告本會、我們的軍事力量不但已經恢複到開戰以前的程度、而且比之開戰時要增加了一倍以上</p>
<p>至於軍需軍實也早經有充分的準備、但是這並不是說我們以後對於抗戰再沒有顧慮、或毫無缺點、更不能設是以後決無艱險的話、反之、為要打破敵人的最後掙扎、我們以後抗戰的環境、必有更艱更險的遭遇、所以我們為要進行我軍有利的反攻、逹到最後的勝利、我們必須不失時機、盡量加强我們的軍事以及政治經濟的力量、我們更要加緊訓練、加緊補充、加緊努力、更要使各地兵役辦有成績、更要使軍民密切聯繫更要使地方自治發逹、關於這種種問題、我們參政員同人來自各地、見聞較切、希望在會期中、盡量提出意見和報告、更希望在會期以後、就壯丁組織、地方自治、和兵員訓練等等的事項、努力進行、盡量協助這是第二點、</p>
<p>適應新局勢之外交</p>
<p>最後要說到外交、這就是說歐洲戰事發生以後、我們將怎樣來適應這個新的局勢、以貫澈我們的抗戰國策、這個問題、最為重大、特別要愼重的研究、我們都知道中日戰爭問題、就是世界問題、而且是世界最大的問題、須知今日世界的戰亂、完全是由日本侵略中國、破壞國際公的、擾亂世界和平的强暴行為所引起來的、我們中國的抗戰、一方面固然是為保障本國的獨立生存</p>
<p>而一方面實在為要制裁這個世界侵略戰爭的禍首日本、維護世界的正義和平、因為如中日戰爭一日不了、世界和平亦就永遠不能恢復、簡單說、中日戰爭就是世界戰爭的起點、亦就是世界戰局的重心、這是各位應特別注意的、何况我們中國是擁有全世界四分之一人口的國家、對於奠立世界永遠的和平秩序、當然要負有重大的義務和責任、自九一八以來、我們的一貫國策、是建立在下列幾個原則之上的、（一）反抗日本侵略以保障我國主權與領土行政的完整、（二）遵守國際公的、允其是國聯盟的、九國公的、與非戰公的、以與世界愛好正義和平之國家、共同維護世界秩序、（三）拒絕參加防共協定、（四）外交在自立自主、完全以本國立塲與抗戰利益為前提、不受任何拘束、以求得中國之自由平等、實行三民主義、重奠世界永久的和平、八年以來、國民政府秉此奮鬥、始終不渝、現在歐戰既起、我們更要固定旣定的方針、不計前途的險易和利害、亦不計國際形勢變化到如何程度、而必求我們一貫的方針、貫澈到底在歐戰旣起以後、敵國的表示是不干涉歐洲戰事、自稱要專力解決「中日戰事」、他所謂不干涉歐洲戰事、換句話說、就是不許歐美干與中日戰事、讓他可以獨霸東亞、建立他所謂「東亞新秩序」、這就是我平時所說的、敵人要在現在世界之外、另造一個世界這豈不是要使他日本這界之外、另造一個國家的名稱、不再存在於現在世界之上一樣麼、除非世界上以後沒有日本這一個國名、否則無論東亞的、中國或日本的、不能脫離現在世界和國際關係、而能孤立獨存的、然而敵人至今還在那裹說這些東亞新秩序的夢話、於此更可見敵人趁火打刦的心理是分外明顯了、但是我們中國却是國策早經決定、立塲始終一貫、我們早從最艱難的情况作打算、無論過去現在和將來、從不有絲毫僥倖的心理、敵人如要想全力來解决中國戰事、我們就可集中全力來消滅敵人的這種野心、使之粉碎無餘、實在說、敵人到今天還說「趕快結束中日戰事」這一類的話、實在是等於痴人說夢、他不想他在兩年以前集中全力來侵略中國、尚不能逹到速戰速决的目的、而待今日其勢已成為强弩之未的時候、還要說這些狂囈、這就是問他日本人自己、恐怕亦不能相信哩、敵人現在兵力早已疲憊、內部尤為空虛若在軍事方面說敵人早巳失敗、而且巳陷於不能自拔的絕境、以後除了軍事以外、他自然要加緊進行他所謂政治進攻、和經濟進攻我們以後只要專心一志來實行我們建國的準備、健全我們抗戰的本身、從種種方面奠立我們勝利的基礎、這就是我們目前惟一的根本問題、各位同人更耍知道、目前是我們國家安危最重要的關鍵、國際形勢、瞬息萬變、我們今天的決策、實在在是關於抗戰成敗、乃至於民族的百世禍福、我們所定的方針、若能正確無誤、不僅軍事的勝利更有把握、而抗戰旣定的目標、亦必可更快的逹成、因此中正十分希望本會同人、於討論決策之時、更要謹慎將事、不厭求詳、一切都要依據我們根本的國策、從眞正是非和國家百年的利害上、貢獻有效的方策、以定今後努力的途徑、本會會期不過十天、時限甚短、中正認為最緊要的、就是上面所說的幾件急切的事、甚望各位集中心力和時間、充分討論、務使得有完滿的結果、這是本席對大會所懇切期望的、（十七日電）</p>

<h3>歐戰給東亞之經濟影響</h3>
<p>— 約翰阿煦婁著　伯明譯</p>
<p>大勢如何？　歐洲又起大戰，遠東諸國無不大受影響；但並不一致；且因時間太早，還不能指點出對於遠東經濟整個的和最後的影響怎樣。上海人士最關切的問題是對舊世界的戰禍，對於中日和兩國戰事將有怎樣的影響？這問題還不能正確地答覆。但是，新發展的若干早期趨勢，已依稀可辨。概括說來：這些趨勢是：入口漸多困難，出口希望却趨濃厚；過出口方面也受航輪短少，和保水險費的騰貴所妨害。</p>
<p>德貨進口與中日　中日的德貨輸入，勢必極度减少；也許有完全絕跡可能；英法封鎖德國西部海岸，阻止貨物自德國口岸運來遠東；公海中的德國航務已告停止。德國雖有取道斯干迭那維亞·荷蘭·比利時·瑞士·義國和巴爾幹諸國轉運出口的可能，但央法當然將取反對步驟。英法對上述諸小國轉運德貨出口極易封鎖；若取道義國而用義日船隻載運，這可能性仍須加以考慮。無論如何，歐戰將使德國的經濟疲蔽，不過向靠德貨進口的各國，也不無困難。允其是機械，金屬製品·鐵·鋼·和許多藥物為然，遠東所輸入這些貨物，不少來自德國。德國方面的供給斷絕，遠東將大感不足。日本在東三省多用德國機械和其他供應品來進行實業化計劃，德國供給旣斷，這些計劃勢將從此延擱；日本本部的戰時工業也將不得不縮小擴張計劃；因為這些計劃是從德國獲得供應物，為其基礎的。</p>
<p>其他進口方面　英法雖能保持其海上貿易，但英法工業大部份將製造戰具和其他物品，供戰事消耗；往常中日兩國輸入的許多英法貨物，將不再運來，至少沒有以前的多；歐洲許多中立國和美國。將在各交戰國覔得利潤很厚的戰時新市塲，所以也將忽略對遠東的輸出；尤其是美國重工業根據歟洲訂購戰具的新定單，勢必使日本大受妨碍。因為日本從外國獲得的軍需中來自美國的不下三分之二。英鎊近來跌價的百分之十五；這新價格也是遠東輸入的另一障碍。日元緊釘英鎊而隨同跌價，日本貿易也受損失。因為日本的輸入，大部份來目未將其貨幣貶値的諸國；國連夏威夷和菲列賓在內，佔日本對非日元集團的輸入的百分之四十八。日本從美國輸入這些貨物，現以日元付價，便須較一個月前多付百分之二十左右。在中國，近來外幣和法幣的滙率巳有劇烈波動；中國的輸入貶價諸國和未貶値諸國的各佔半數；但中國仍將繼續或增加從央鎊集國諸國輸入貨物，但比之從並不貶價諸國輸入貨物却已便宜，不過却有戰事上的障碍罷了。</p>
<p>影響遠東金融　中日兩國極緊迫的外滙局面已因新近的貨幣發展而更緊迫。倫敦的貨幣不再像以前那末低廉；用英鎊劃算款項的日本對外貿易，所費之巨，前所未見；日本的滙兌銀行根據倫敦百分之二的貼現率而預結他在國內交易的，現因貼現率漲百分之三以上，而大受損失。香港實行外滙統制，中國與外界的金融在來亦不無妨碍。現集中香港的中國金融機關將否被迫移往馬尼刺，而由英國轉受美國的保護和便利？留侍他日瞧吧！</p>
<p>原料市塲繁榮　就他方面說：世界對於遠東貸物需耍現更迫切，這是可以吿慰的；美國至少有一部份軍需業突盛，因此蘇彝士運河以東諸國的軍需商業，也都有興盛之望。紐的證券交易所的股票價格已因歐戰而劇漲二分之一甚至幾乎漲一倍。紐的的物價也騰貴，照美國農業部長觀測，且有持久可能。因而美國小麥的出口津貼亦撤銷了。</p>
<p>東方多數國家的大主顧是美國，他們的商業情况和經濟發展，繫於美國經濟發展的程度非淺；美國商業蕭條，東方商業也蕭條；美國市况繁榮，遠東商業也復盛。美國商界對於實施中立法，將妨碍以軍需躉售給英法這事，沒有絲毫恐懼。</p>
<p>歐美需要遠東原料益切，最獲利的將是英屬馬來，荷屬東印度，法屬越南等殖民地國家，暹羅產橡皮與錫，也將獲若干利益。中國出產多種原料，歐美需要最著的是多鎢砂·銻·錫·桐油·絲·鬃·生熟皮革·和菜油；目前去幣匯率旣低，而物價有騰貴趨勢，自應促進這些生產物的輸出。但除「自由的中國」和日方侵佔區目前所設法輸出的以外，要運更多的產物和金屬出境，却不無困難；日人將在長江流域，用一切强迫手段，搜括種種出口貨去換取外匯。但在華北，本年旣有洪水與蝗虫為災，故巳失去其重要輸出區的地位了。</p>
<p>日本的輸出業　但日本本國只能輸出一種適於軍用的原料，那只是絲，二十條分的生絲是製造降落傘，汽球和其他戰具的原料；橫濱和神戶的絲價，現已一致突漲到每包日金一千五百元左右的空前高價。然而日本出產或製造的其他軍用原料，却是日本自己要在華繼續戰爭時亟需的，除非使戰爭告終；日本的戰時工業，現儘最高能力僱用工人，生產日本自己所需的戰具；但遠東的輸入旣有新困難，日本戰時工業的繼統擴張，便將因而遲滯了。</p>
<p>日本的和平實業，允其是紡織業，對於歐戰抱有很高的輸出希望，因為他期望各交戰國的這種出品不冉運來；還期望有些中立國也將减少這些出品運來遠東；因此日本紡織業想乘機獨佔遠東市塲，並在馬來，印度，非洲，澳洲甚至拉丁美洲各國，劇烈擴張其市塲；近年日本國內物價高漲，巳使他在過去兩年中的出口，受極嚴重的妨害。現在世界物價水準已因戰爭而一般的增高，日本的損失，便將得到部份的償補；日本紡織業在海外的競爭力，大為恢復。但實現道些希望的最大障碍是缺少必要的外匯，因此不得添購原棉和紙漿等外國原料；英美或法國從第一决大戰後，旣已經歷過日本置他國於死地的戰爭，故日本已不能期望此三國再將貸款資助他的輸出業。</p>
<p>遠東航運業　遠東貿易的戰時發展中，航運問題最嚴重；許多遠東航務至少已暫吿停止或大為减少，歐洲各交虞國的商輪大部份須輔助海軍，因此他們將縮小在遠東的航務活動；德國潛艇戰旣在進行，兵險費已大大昂高；日本雖是遠東唯一有大隊商船的國家；但因為他的商輪的五分之一左右，亦被徵發着使用，在運輸軍需；此外五分之三的日船則往來在大坂，橫濱，神戶和大連間疏解其積貨的擁擠；因此他可供航行公海的仍不過五分之一；如想增造船隻，將遇難獲足量建造材料的困難；所以日本在目前或不遠將來，也不能獨佔世界這部份的航運。</p>
<p>結綸　從上述的一切情勢看來，歐戰爆發結果，似乎已使遠東立刻添上整個的經濟困難；就中日兩國說：東亞因歐戰血獲利的希望，似乎還在更遠的將來；但東亞兩交戰國，又並未因彼此力竭而願早日停戰；中日輸入外國戰具雖將困難，但兩國都巳積貯大量軍需，能照目前的範圍繼續武裝衝突很久；而且日本的一切外國軍需，將盡被截斷；但中國至少可繼續取得蘇聯的接濟。道種局勢，日本在軍備上所佔的優勢，顯已减低；而中國最後勝利的希望却更濃厚了。</p>
<h3>海關收受「華興幣」後之上海進口貿易</h3>
<p>— 王友聲</p>
<p>今年上半年度上海的進口貿易，超過了一萬三千六百萬關金，比去年同時期增加了幾乎一倍。這個突然的景氣引起了一般進口商對於前途樂觀的空氣。然仔細分析一下，這個進口貿易的景氣，並不是一種正常的發展。因為內地不靖，大部份鄉下的有錢人，都把上海當做避難的安樂鄉。這樣引起上海人口空前激增和大量資金的集中。大量消費品的需要刺激了進口貿易。可是我們看到，這許多避難者，決不是可靠的主顧。他們大部都是消費者，而不是眞正的生產者。當他們的錢用得差不多的時候，他們自然只能回鄉去了。進口貿易的景氣是不能長久維持的。</p>
<p>最近外匯的暴縮，增加了進口貿易衰落的趨勢。自九月一日起海關又公佈了進口稅須用「華興券」支付的通告。因為「華興券」和法幣的折合率，被偽監督定在「華興券」一元折合法幣一·五五元（九月一日的折合率）的價格上，海關進口稅，無形中增加了百分之五十五。雖則近來因為歐戰關係外匯略略放長，可是「華興券」的折合率還在一元三角以上。這樣本來在風雨飄搖中的進口貿易，受了外匯和關稅的兩軍的打擊，勢必一落千丈了。</p>
<p>可是「華興券」對於上海各國進口商的打擊，是並不一致的。在表面上看來，好像英美的貨物和日貨受到同樣比例的增稅。在暗地裹日貨却享到特殊的待遇。因為從九月一日起，海關對於估價上的外幣折合方法，也更改了。日方利用日金在滬市塲上的跌價，强逼海關對於進口日貨之付稅價値之計算方法，改將日幣依滬上市價折合法幣，再由法幣依外匯暗市，折合金鎊，再由英鎊折合成海關金單位。如此日貨的付稅價値，就减到照九月一日以前計算的價格三分之一。現在所需付的稅款，即使加上百分之五十「華興券」折合而來的增稅，還比九月一日以前要少付一半。海關這種特別優待日貨的辦法，無疑將使上海海關各國進口貿易的數字，起一個重大的變化。</p>
<p>所以，海關進口稅受「華興券」的目標，並不只是為了增加稅收或是推行偽幣，却在背後隱藏着排擠英美貨物出上海市塲的陰謀。將來上海的進口貿易，將為日商所壟斷是不難預測的。</p>
<p>編者按：日貨完稅，原依照Yen　100＝37.5G．U．（即日圓官價Y．1：I．2d），現改用Y？=Ch．　？＝f？＝G．U．？公式，於是日圓依中國暗市價折算所得之金鎊數當然少得多；所能合得的關金數當亦减少三分之二了，因黑市日圓比日圓官價小得多之故。</p>
<h3>戰時日本海運業之瞻望</h3>
<p>— 李叔民</p>
<p>日本乃一島國，其海運商業之特別昌逹，理為意中事也。其商船總噸數的四百萬噸（據民二十六年統計），此固不堪與英美二國相較量（日本商船總噸數的為英國五分之一，美國四分之一，列國間佔第三位）然於亞洲則可謂之首屈一指，絕無倫比者矣。</p>
<p>按日本國內經營之公司，其大者的有三：日本郵船會社，大阪商船會社，日淸汽船會社。蓋前者為日本最大之輪船公司，有商船的一百八十艘，計八十八萬噸（近年或有所增）。大阪商船會社，以運貨著稱。後者以經營中國長江航業為著，自我國沿江各都陷落後如南京，鎮江，蕪湖，長沙，漢口等，該公司之營業乃更見活躍。近年日本對外貿易之入超，恃此項獲利以彌補，實不在少數。</p>
<p>至於其對外貿易之活動，則幾遍全球，茲擇日本郵船會社之重要路錢，的略述之如下：</p>
<p>（一）美國舊金山綫　自香港上海經日本橫濱取南道檀香山而至美國舊金山。每二星期航行一次，自上海至舊金山航程計二十四日。</p>
<p>（二）美國西雅圖綫　自香港上海經日本橫濱北航至西雅圖，二星期一次。</p>
<p>（三）歐洲綫　自日本經上海，香港，新嘉坡，（哥倫布）亞丁，印度，蘇彝士，馬賽而至英國倫教，自上海至倫敦的計三十五日。</p>
<p>（四）澳洲綫　自日本經上海，香港，斐列賓（馬尼刺）而抵澳洲之新金山，每月航行一次。</p>
<p>（五）印度孟買綫　自日本經上海，香港，新嘉坡，可倫布抵孟買，每月一次。（未完）</p>
<h3>工商業應如何努力</h3>
<p>— 關鑄辛</p>
<p>上海的工商業，在淪為孤島後，曾經遭遇了某一時期的特殊繁榮。可是此種繁榮，到了最近，業已消失了。每一工商業在擴張設備以後，沒一家不是愈覺到尾大不掉的痛苦。最大的是：</p>
<p>（一）資金周轉的困難　在特殊繁榮中間，因物價上昇，與由各種特殊關係所招致的銷路增進，使每一工廠為了獲得了大的利潤計，不能不擴張企業的設備。舉事實來說：一家五千元的工廠，在特殊繁榮期中，享到很大的利潤，到了某一時期，他們的資金統統變成商品；那些商品照市價合算起來，還是很賺錢的。可是這時候困難的問題就來了：第一，原料漲貴，本來只要五千元的現却非一萬元不可。但製成品一時旣不能變現，减價發售又非所願，所以在簿記數字上，沒一家生產機關不是得利的，實際上則等於在資金變成商品的過程上，作循環性的活動，並沒有什麼所得。換句話說：資金愈大，製成品愈多；商品愈多，則需耍的資金愈大。而資金呢，在目前孤島中，雖然游資很多，但此項游資差不多為投機事業所獨佔。一家金融機關，他們當然明瞭工商業的情形，他們知道現在上海的企業放款，多少是帶些投機的危險性的；那裹還有款子借給企業家？企業家　　　有得到放款的機會？</p>
<p>（二）原料來源與商品出路的恐慌　每一工商業必須要原料，也必須找市塲。原料來源有的是內地，有的是外國，都不在上海，因為上海是沒有出產的，市塲呢，國外自然也有，但主要還是上海本埠與內地，在特殊繁榮期間，因了上海一時人口的擁到，與戰事生產停滯，所以沒一家工廠不是感覺生物太少，不够應付市上的要求。到了最近，這一種良好環境顯已轉變。原料呢，因為上海的環境特殊之故，不但價格不能有正確的估計，就是來源也不能有如何的把握。製成品在上海已有大量的囤貨，而沒有新的需要。至於內地呢，雖然知道是在欠缺大量的工業品，可是沒有方法運送進去。所以一面是原料的恐慌，一面是存貨的恐慌。缺少資金是工商業最感困難的一件事，而存貨的　滯更是資金不足周轉的一個原因，有的人還認為存貨的漲價，工商業還有繼續活動的可能：可是這種簿記上的盈餘，對整個企業本身，徒然加軍困難而已。活動的範圍愈大，此項困難必然愈重。</p>
<p>這兩件當前的困難，可以說沒一家工商業不感覺恐慌。可是這是不是中國工商業沒有前途？中國工商業是有前途的！但是上海工商業却沒有前途！</p>
<p>我們需知道上海今日的特殊地位，所謂生產事業的目標，當然在增加國家的生產力量。可是上海的生產對國家有什麽帮助呢？上海的工商業活動的範圍愈大，使國家對這一個「孤島」的負擔格外加重。正同資金愈集中，瓷金逃避的就愈大。國家分出大部份力量來維持「孤島」，這是絕大的浪費。我們只舉洋米一項來說：中國今年豐收，本來可以不必買洋米；可是因為上海人口過剩，以及國米被阻。所以結果不能不化費國家的外匯來買洋米。一切工商業的活動，對國家的影響正是這樣！中國的生產機關與生產資金躱在孤島上作一切非正常的活動，這正是每個工商家的奇恥大辱！</p>
<p>工商業今日必須明瞭這一點。中國工商業的發展是有極良好條件的，可是這個條件在內地，而不在上海。內地與上海巳造成了兩極端地位：內地是缺少物資，而上海是物資積滯。中國的工商業與金融家要是能够到內地去發展，不但在工業品價格高漲下，是一個良好條件；而原料人工的低康與廣大的消費羣，更可以加强此項條件。</p>
<p>組成上海的特殊繁榮的各種因素，因了工商業與投機事業過度擴張，以及各種環境的改變，都已經消失了。上海的工商業與金融業，在這時候覺醒，時間上還有一個機會。要不然，那末跟着所謂「上海景氣」同到沒落的道上去吧！</p>

<h3>怎樣來掃除有碍優生的疾病？</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞動大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>一切的生物在生活的過程中，皆有生殖行為，很少自願禁慾的，即使是野蠻民族，亦是每人必要結婚的；他們認獨身為罪，所以許多野蠻人皆比文明人為早婚。很不幸我國很多的地方亦盛行早婚，在都市的靑年雖不早婚，然大半趨向於婚姻外的淫慾，從優生學的觀點說，很為有害，蓋荒淫之結果，使生殖力急遽衰退，腎虧早洩，所生之子女亦必衰弱低能，甚或不能生育，此種優秀人材子女的稀少，卽無異於建設事業的承繼者之稀少。當然，吾人絕對不贊成國家社會的事業，是世代承襲的：但吾人非常希望：將來能更繁殖優秀的人材，使一切事業更加發揚，更加光大，在這種情形下，才可顯出進步。不然，不僅人口漸稀，而智能亦每况愈下，此所以提倡優生之重要也。</p>
<p>在優生學之觀點上說，一方面應使不良的體格變為强壯，一方面有遺傳病的人禁止結婚，另一方面將優秀體格的人加緊生育，三方面實行，方能保民族質的優秀，强國强種方能逹到。</p>
<p>至於講到妨碍優生的疾病，莫如花柳病了。此外之腎虧，神經衰弱，未老先衰等症，亦屬優生之敵，現在醫學進步，雖能將此種疾病治好，但淋病與梅毒等症，仍然蔓延廣泛，惟神經衰弱及早衰，腎虧不育等症，已有準確的治療法，此卽內分泌劑發明之功也。</p>
<p>吾人今將花柳病不加論述，蓋此為社會問題，就以腎虧早洩，陰痿，神經衰弱，婚後不育等症而論，如能積極施以德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」治之，立得回春效果，良由該劑功能補腦，補腎，補血，並能促進新陳代謝的機能，長服之後，確具返老還童之功，欲實踐優生，享健康之幸福者，允宜常服，其女用者有調經種子，治貧血乳癟之功。</p>

<h3>不必需要的淋藥</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>現在還需一般落伍的淋藥，重新値得提起嗎？然而社會上的情形複雜，一般頭腦頑固者，猶以為落伍之淋病療法，或可收根治之效。而事實上往往給此等腦經陳腐者以打擊。到其時雖已懊悔，但已不及矣。</p>
<p>余自留美醫科大學時，於淋病之治療，即已分其餘晷，加以研究，對於當時各國淋病內服藥加以分析，發見許多所調特效藥，都不過是强霸之藥，如　用檀香油，蓽沉茄等富有反應與不快之副作用，如小便雖一時痛苦减少，但不旋踵小便即减少痛苦增加，並遺有不堪設想之後患，允其是對胃腸之刺戟更大。患者服用此等落伍之成藥，胃口每為之倒敗。抵抗力因之减弱，結果淋病亦隨之增惡。故吾人對於此等淋病內服藥，實不需要服用。</p>
<p>在余多方而之觀察及實騐，以德國「克淋儂」功效最為優勝。余自親身試驗，分析其功效，則其殺菌力能直逹病灶，並毫無損及健全之組織。因之更偉大之消炎鎮痛利尿之功。此其特點之一。「克淋儂」之殺菌力固甚强大，而且毫不損害健全組織，更無使胃腸受刺戟而嘔吐。故凡淋病之急慢性淋，只須服用「克淋儂」，卽可迅速而愈。例如急性淋時之尿道炎，服「克淋儂」後，小便暢利，在一二星期中便完全治愈。至於慢性淋，則「克淋儂」具有包圍淋菌之殺菌力，當然不復畏其逃竄他處，故一經治愈，永可不發。</p>
<h3>久咳之危機</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>蓋咳嗽不已，能傷及肋膜，時日旣久抵抗力隨而减少，此時往往為肺勞菌侵襲之機會，所謂傷風不治變成癆者，意即指是。此時患者肺部感覺刺痛，為肺病初起之微象。但如能在此初步時期盡力求治，每能化險為夷，就余二十餘年之經騐而觀，患者可積極內服德國治肺聖藥「補肺拿爾」，鎮咳止癆有特殊功效，不論如何强力咳嗽，服「補肺拿爾」在三小時內，即可完全鎮定咳嗽，並能减除肺部酸素之功，而使癆菌失其活動力，故即使已成癆病症之咯血咯痰，氣急胸痛，盜汗潮熱等症，服之無不霍然就愈。</p>
<h3>確實有效的遺精療法</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>要研究遺精的治法，先要認淸生理的與病態遺精的界限，但此界限，頗不易劃分，視各人的體質，生活和營養等種種狀况之不同而各異，據珂爾希曼（Curschmann）氏的意見：「淸醒時不遺精，睡夢中雖遺精而不感疲倦與任何不適者，且遺精純出自然，非由人工之刺激，如自凟，淫慾想象等，大的二三星期遺精一次者，均可謂生理而非病熊。」據此可知遺精後感覺疲憊，决數過多，以及白畫遺精和陰莖不勃起的遺精者，均為病態，病態的遺精，皆須注意攝養，吾則體力日襄，以致性神經衰弱，腦弱腎虧，其為害甚大，但至於確實有效的治療方法，除注意攝養方法之外，其最重耍者，允當選擇切實有效的藥劑以鞏固其精關，其在臨床上確具實效者，首推內服德國遺精專藥「耐而斯遺精片」以余治療之經驗所知，不論任何頻繁之遺精，凶惡之滑精，在第一次服後即不發生，體虚者兼以「補體康」服之，效允確實，並能安靜大腦，故能兼治失眠症。</p>

<h3>失孕的攝護腺炎</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>在急慢性淋毒攝護腺炎，每使生殖力减弱，如實質性攝護腺炎，更易釀成此果。大家皆以為吾人之來源，由於父精母血所造成；而不知是精子為生命之原素，然有此原素，如其無攝護腺液則活潑而微妙的精子，勢必無法生存而涸斃，如此言之，則攝護腺的不健全，卽為男性失去授孕力之根據，而其最易破壞攝護腺之分泌機能者，以淋病之病源菌為最，以其破壞力甚大，且大多淋病患者，往往在急性淋時，被一般不知利害之市醫，行出劣之療法，或服富有副作用之市上劣藥，逼迫淋菌內竄，破壞攝護腺的分泌機能，此時的患者，即為攝護腺炎。在吾等醫家嚴格的統計上言之，凡患淋毒性攝護腺炎，其失治者，十九有失去授姙力，蓋因攝護腺之分泌機能因淋毒之破壞而停止，卽不然淋菌混入攝護腺液，亦能將精虫毒殺。結果自然不能逹使妻孥受姙的目的。</p>
<p>要挽救此等失姙之攝護腺炎，祇有釜底抽薪之法，用淋病特效藥「克淋儂」為內服藥，使其附緣於攝矆腺間之淋菌，完全為「克淋儂」一藥所扑滅，如此因淋菌而發炎，及破壞分泌機能者，自然徹底可以消炎而恢復正常之生理機能，余一方並用手術及靜電療法等，允易奏功，診時：上午十時至下午六時。自卽日起每天送診二十號每號僅取號金五角，並送價値一元之「性病全書」一册。</p>

<h3>調查戶口限制遷居　日僞行動益積極　法租界在滬防範加嚴　調整防區事並無新發展</h3>
<p>自日偽侵入越界築路、控制各要點、雖未妨害租界探捕在滬西一帶、行使警權、但曹家渡五角塲與億定盤路崗捕手槍先後被刦、其幕後企圖、實有壓迫租界巡捕不得不撤退之勢、以致形勢日趨嚴重、今日為「九一八」、故兩租界戒備、較往年為緊張、茲分誌各項消息於後、</p>
<p>在巨厦內建交通壕</p>
<p>法租界捕房、昨日在海格路地豐路福開森路一帶、防範甚嚴、曾派出鐵甲車一輛、終日在該地巡邏、各重要路口、均駐有大批探捕、搜查行人、勞利育路已用鐵絲網封鎖、其他各路口、亦均增加崗位、徐家滙情形如常、海格路四四八號林氏巨厦、由十三日被日偽佔據後、已連日在內外、布置防禦工程、昨日竟掘壕溝一道、由屋內通至屋外、用意不明、</p>
<p>日方限制房客遷居</p>
<p>愚園路四明別墅及中實新村、自被日偽管衖後、即有日憲兵前往按戶調查戶口、昨悉已調查告竣、經日偽方面禁止二房東遷出、三房客則可自由遷出遷入、連日三房客均紛紛遷出、二房東則一籌莫展、據該處房客告記者、四明中實兩衖房租、久已由日偽方面强迫收取、彼等恐二房東一旦遷出後、房租將無從收得、故限制綦嚴、白利南路兆豐公園附近居戶、現正由日偽方面覆查戶口、昨日上午、並有日憲兵多名、闖入兆豐別墅、除調查戶口外、並向該別墅之居戶、探詢房租之確數、及其經租行號之名稱、探詢詳悉以後、即威脅住戶、告以此後應將房租繳付日本憲兵隊、不得違抗、聞該墅各房客、已將經過情形、報告房東、惟前途究將如何演變、則難預測、</p>
<p>僞警增加日兵放哨</p>
<p>大西路哥倫比亞路口設分偽警派出所、所內所駐偽警、近日突形增加、並不時派出在各該路上巡邏、安和寺路一帶、則日軍卡車及機器脚踏車來往頻繁、亦與往日不同、入夜則日兵並在安和寺路凱旋路放哨、</p>
<p>防禦工事昨已築就</p>
<p>極司非而路十一號慈聯分會三十一收容所房屋一部份、於九日波日偽佔據、作為用途、昨日日偽向所方宜稱、即將在該屋內、大片空地上自建房屋、一俟造竣、原佔據之房屋、即可歸還、仍讓難民居住云、自前晚起、日偽已改由旁門進出、（即難童中學出入之戶）來去頻繫、開納路偽警所造之沙袋防禦工事、昨巳改造完竣、</p>
<p>滬西事件續待交涉</p>
<p>關於滬西越界築路問題、工部局總裁兼總辦費利浦、曾於十五日赴市中心訪偽「市長」傳筱庵、作直接談判、談話內容、未經宣佈、但據可靠方面消息、前日談話中、對於越界築路之警權。稅收。以及其他重要問題、均已交換意見、建立繼續討論之基礎、但費氏對進展狀况及前日討論詳細情形、一時尚不允發表、</p>
<p>調查防區在考慮中</p>
<p>日駐滬海軍陸戰隊司令失戶、十三日邀集英美意各國駐滬防軍司令會議、建議調整防區、並說明將於數日後提出一具體方案、各國防軍司令當時未加可吾、僅允提付三國參謀會議研究、現悉自美國亞洲艦隊司令赫穗抵滬後、英美意三國防軍司令間、迭有接觸、現正對日方建議、加以縝密之研究、以備提出對案、發展如何、固無從得知、但據某方傳出消息、在最短期內、必召集各國防軍司令、舉行二决會議、外傳英軍防區一二日內、將由美軍塡防之說、昨日尚不能證實、但可信為係一部外僑之意見、</p>
<p>蘇州河北情形如常</p>
<p>連日盛傳日方覬覦蘇州河北英軍防區、擬將北江西路以西至西藏路一帶、加以封鎖、大中社記者昨日下午、會赴上述各地視察、目擊一切情形如常、北江西路海寗路口通入北四川路之缺口處、駐守日兵仍為二人、並未增加、對往來行人之通行證、檢查甚嚴、北江西路底靶子路口、則設有英兵崗位、北河南路界路通入寳山路之處鐵絲網封鎖如故、日軍仍站崗於界路之北、西藏路海寗路口、亦有英軍駐守、惟據愛爾近路均益里某居民云、前日曾有人至各里弄吿知居民、目前請各安心居住、日方於下月十日、始將蘇州河北區域、歸日軍管轄、是後居民、則非備有通行證不可、</p>
<h3>滬溫航行　又受阻撓</h3>
<p>滬溫綫航行恢復後、即有怡隆洋行之神福輪及衛利韓公司之新安利輪、於日前先行駛溫、茲據日方揚言又有封鎖溫州灣之企圖、故滬溫綫航行似又有阻梗、原定明（十九）日開溫之英商遠東船務公司之永泰輸、巳準備中止駛溫、改開天津、</p>
<h3>滬黑市外滙變動　無損中國抗戰　成爲日僞套取外滙中心　投機人興風作浪塲所</h3>
<p>上海向爲中國貿易之中心、經濟之樞紐、遠東唯一大埠、全國對外貿易百分之四十五、集中於是、以貿易金融樞紐之故、遂成外匯供給之中心、全國外匯行市、視之為準則、於是其匯市波動影響及、關係整個中國幣制之地位、戰後中國抗戰經濟重心、移向西南諸省、而對外貿易中心、以滇越緬諸路爲主、貿易金融、亦分散於昆明·河內·仰光·香港諸地、上海外匯與中國政府及其抗戰經濟力之連繫關係、遠不如戰前與中國經濟命脈連繫之重要、自政府管理國內匯兌後、上海資本、可以自由內移、而西南諸省資本、以申匯限制關係、不能自由流入滬市、所以上海之外匯投機、影響內地資金移動、遠不若戰前、上海今日之經濟地位、雖仍以長江流域爲主、而其經濟之控制、已非中國政府權力所及外匯黑市變動之經濟影饗、無關於抗戰基礎、故上海外匯匯率、已不能代表中國眞正對外購買力、而上海外匯市塲、已成為日偽套取外匯之中心、投機商人興風作浪之塲所、所以中國之外匯平進基金委員會、對上海之外匯黑市、巳不予維持、聽其自然、但非淪陷區域各地之外匯、經努力維持後依然穩定、法定價格、從無變動、</p>
<h3>大批無米麵粉　運津接濟</h3>
<p>天津自發生水災後、糧食異常恐慌、故需求甚殷、由某方在蕪湖採購國米三十萬擔、絡續運往接濟、津帮客家在滬亦訂購大批麵粉、現已購進四十餘萬包、惟對於裝運甚為困難、英輪衹至塘沽、而太古公司又無棧房、故衹怡和洋行有棧房可裝、上星期五巳有一批運往、今日又有三萬七千一百包運津、聞日輪運去者為數至鉅、</p>
<h3>今日九一八紀念　全市戒備周密　兩租界警員及萬國商團　出動警戒實施嚴密搜檢　接壤處佈置障碍物</h3>
<p>今日為「九一八」紀念、公共租界與法租界警務當局除已調遺全部警力、會同萬國商團義勇隊、加緊巡邏及嚴密搜檢行人車輛外、對於兩租界接壞處之愛多亞路福煦路兩邊各馬路交通、亦一如「八一三」時規定、佈置障碍物、兼派隊員探捕駐守、公共租界方面、僅叫川路·福建路·浙江路·虞洽卿路·同孚路·西摩路·赫穗路。等、留有通行間道、法租界方面、僅新橋街·敏體尼蔭路·聖錄院路·亞爾培路·古拔路。等可以交通、惟一切來往行人車輛、概須受檢、而對於宵禁後允為嚴密、此外、兩租界警備車及鐵甲車、亦同時出動盤桓梭巡、</p>
<p>探捕商團聽候調遣</p>
<p>公共租界警務處方面、於十六日午後、向全體警務人員等發出通告、知照各部、着將各警務人員以及探捕等之例假、暫時撤消、待節後恢復、同時一切請假、亦暫在禁止之列、務令各員勿離職守、俾利調遺、此外、更將出動全體萬國商團義勇隊輔助警員工作、故萬國商團司令、巳於咋日頒發命令、囑令各隊員在辦公時間內、亦須一律戎裝、聽候命令、</p>
<p>各界停止宴會娛樂</p>
<p>「九一八」東北事變、為日本向中國侵略領土之開始、全國各界、每値此日、必集會紀念、以誌沉痛、茲今日為第八週年紀念日、本市各界、以環境特殊、並不舉行任何紀念儀式、亦不下半旗、但決自動停止娛樂宴會一犬、多數市民、則自動茹素一天、以表示堅毅沉着之意志、並堅定抗戰必勝、建國必成之信念、</p>

<p>當局通知今日暫停</p>
<p>上海市米號業同業公會辦理各團體平糶西貢洋米八千包五平糶處、今日適逢九一八紀念日、兩租界警務當局恐有意外發生、特於昨日通知該業公會、米號業公會接獲當局通知後、即轉知五平糶處云、「敬啟者、茲奉兩租界當局通知、明日為九一八紀念、在戒備期間、各平糶處均應停止糶米一天、十九日照常平糶、茲送上公告一紙、請為張貼週知為荷、此致第某平糶處、其公告云、「茲奉公共租界工部局。法租界公董局通知、明日為九一八紀念、在戒備期間、各平糶處均停止糶米一天、十九日照常平糶、特此公告、</p>
<p>五處平糶秩序稍佳</p>
<p>各平糶處因第一日（十六）購買平糶米者擁擠、致西門路呂班路四九一號山東會館第四處發生慘禍、昨第二日各平糶處均於事前經各處負責人嚴密佈置、攔以繩索、置以竹排木柵、惟一俟門鎖啟開、即有三五成羣之大批平民、紛紛入內、爭先恐後、向售票處爭購米票、五色錢鈔、飛舞櫃前、記者竚立遙望、見頒米處秩序井然、內部職員先向購米者收回米票、然後付以米糧、各處平糶塲所皆有大批武裝巡捕保護、愛文義路卡德路轉角第二平糶處情形亦緊張、至深夜才告結束、北河南路老靶子路第平糶處、昨日下午暫停平糶、所有未糶完米糧一百包、轉運至第二平耀處、</p>

<p>捕房竭力維持秩序</p>
<p>昨日各平糶處情形、第一處捕房派有西捕一名、印捕一名、華捕十二名、維持秩序、該處因接近老靶子路寳山路日軍防區、又係九一八之前夕、故糶至上午十二時即停止、下午未開糶、第二區派有西捕四人、印捕一人、華捕二十名、將鐵絲網及繩索、沿國光中學攔成一走廊、循序而進、因顧全羣衆久淋雨中、提早一小時開糶（七時）、復延長時問、以三百包米糶完為止、第三處派有中西探捕二十餘人、用鐵絲網攔阻出入口、至下午三時、即將三白包貢米售罄、第四處因前日發生慘事、咋晨七時中西探捕二十餘名、即將薩坡賽路呂班路中問之西門路一段交通完全遮斷、購米者由薩坡賽路進口、至山東會館右首鐵門列隊依次入內、再從呂班路走出、故秩序井然、第五處門首添置鐵絲網等秩序亦佳、</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>運動和休息</h3>
<p>— 施開先</p>
<p>無論　什麽運動後，隨之必要休息，並不限於人類，也不限於共他動物，即如無生命的東西，只運動而無休息，也是不成的，只運動而不休息所造成的後桀是損壞甚至或是壽終，例如一部機器，終日的運動，若不給以休息，則此機器必易損壞，人類亦如此，每决運動後必須有充份的時間來休息，因為休息能引起新陳代謝的作用，把運動時所消耗的精力，能够靜養復元，否則祇把精力不斷的耗去，不休息，那麼人體內所有的精力，不久耗精元。精力巳無，試問此時還有性命嗎？</p>
<p>睡眠是最大的一種休息，學校裹每上一小時的課，總有十分鐘的休息，這是因為在一小時之間，腦部受到運動，所以才借這十分鍊的時間來給腦部靜養靜麥；使它能够補足以前所消耗的，又如玩球也有相當的時間來休息，電影院內放映至一半，也來個十分鐘的休息，這是因為放映機運動了多時，並且司放映機的人及看客的眼光都須休息之故。</p>
<p>不過，運動和休息二件事，須調劑得平均，不可祇休息而不運動，休息而不運動即是懶，往往有許多人祇以休息二字來推托，醫如明明不讀書，但偏要說是在休息，明明沒有工作，偏要說是休息，休息休息何其多，有休息，必有運動，有運動必有休息，旣不運動，為何休息，此話豈非矛盾；反之，只運動而不休息，也不能算是勤，二者必須平均，若二者之中，無論缺運動或缺休息，都是有害無益，換句話說，運動和休息，分配得適當，則消耗必不會盡，前面所消耗的後面立刻捕充了</p>
<h3>晴雨兩用衣的新發明</h3>
<p>— 楊眉</p>
<p>如果一個人穿了一件簇新衣服出門去訪友或遊玩，在中途時忽然遭逢大雨，那麼這個人必定被雨淋得像落湯鶏一樣，而這件簇新的衣服也就此變成舊衣了，這種穿衣上的最大缺憾，許多人一向為他可惱着。但又沒有法子去預防，假使說先穿上件雨衣吧！但又是嫌麻煩而不方便的，現在市上已有晴雨鞋，睛雨帽的發明，而倫敦在最近却有晴雨兩用衣的發現了。</p>
<p>晴雨兩用衣的原料是人造纖維素和明絲草，（產在南菲洲及馬來羣島）兩種交織的。這明絲草的發現人是倫敦惠司登帽廠的工程師的翰來惠新頓氏John　Lywesinton當一九二〇年來惠新頓發現了明絲草後，就在廠中先行化濾，提煉出它的潤滑而富吸收性的紫液來製造帽子，翌年就發明了防雨帽。</p>
<p>據本月七日倫敦快訊報上載有來惠新頓繼續發明了一種「晴雨兩用外衣」的消息，而且它已與某鉅商合作，在倫敦東站傍的威尼斯街開始製造，預計在十一月之前，可出一萬件的睛雨兩用外衣哩。</p>
<p>這晴雨兩用衣和普通的西服沒有二致，一樣有絲織或毛織的分別，不過比較昂貴些而已。據說本市某大公司已向該廠定下二百件的衣服，有明年一月間來滬的消息，這樣看來，不久這兩用衣又可和孤島人士相見了。</p>
<h3>電話常識</h3>
<p>— 來</p>
<p>請佇候表軌聲</p>
<p>在使用電話之時，首耍之事務，即為佇候表軌聲，在巳往當吾人一提起聽筒時，立能聽得表軌聲，但在目前因世界戰事風雲緊急，因此使用電話之人數及决數激增，而上海一，埠之電話服務，亦受其影響矣。近來上海一埠，不論男女，均已增加其電話之决數，允其中區部份在晨間九時半起至十二時止之時間內為最，因中區部份，有交易市塲，銀委，報館，行政機關，軍事機關，領事公館，航運公司均為互通戰事消息，訽問各項市價，以及日常營業之交往，在在需用電話也。</p>
<p>查電話公司各總機周能應付增加之電話决數，但目前之情形，係屬特殊發生者，竄話使用次數之突然增多，而又集中於某一時期，故此並非為設備之能力問題而有增加設備以應付需要之必要矣。此猶每當電影院散塲時，門前街車接踵，有時突然宣告客滿，銀行在月終之滿擠存戶，船隻啟行落輪埠之送者纍纍，每人起而作同一之動作，於是特殊情形，即隨之發生。電話服務所發生之阻碍，厥為表軌聲之較為遲緩，用戶惟有靜候，因此種現象，並非為電話公司服務之不力，實為世界各處風雲緊急，本市各業之交接特殊繁忙，有以致之。</p>
<p>有若干電話用戶，因佇候表軌聲而感覺煩悶。於是將電話聽筒取下，放置於檯上，繼續其所作之工作，不時將聽筒舉起，以聽其表軌聲之有無。雇有接綫生之電話總機，則又將幹錢與外界接連而不時聽其表軌聲之到吾，此種動作，於實際無補而反足以使電話服務失其靈速之常態，前經上海電話公司加以調查，據云有多數用戶，即待有表軌聲時，亦並不即撥號碼，使用電話云。</p>
<p>目前無論船隻，火車，飛機，商業，以至於電報及郵遞種種事務，均入於遲緩狀態，有若干種服務更甚而入於停頓狀態，以電話而論，中區之電話用戶最易感受表軌聲遲緩之不便；然上海電話公司業已設法添增設備以應付此目前之急需，但有若干機械，決非在短時期間可以備就，但的至九月中旬起，即可將此種情形，逐漸免除云。</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>天大要吃葷的菜，無非是肉與魚罷了；似乎吃得有些膩，總要掉換掉換口味纔好。要掉口味，那麼蟹是出色當行的東西了。大紮蟹雖還沒有上市，但是小蟹郤早就出現於小菜塲上，輔幣三角，也可買到十隻至十二隻，儘可供日夜兩餐之需了。煮蟹的方法，普通計有三種，一種是將整個的蟹切爲兩爿，和靑菜一同紅燒：第二種是將蟹切成兩爿之後，拖了麵粉，再加些毛豆肉，一同紅燒；第三種是炒蟹粉，手續上比較麻煩一些，第一步先須將蟹炻熱，然後出黃出肉，和了韮芽蛋花同炒，用些猪油炒允妙，倘嫌輔佐品太少，不耐咀嚼，那麽冉加些肉絲在內，味兒也就更加可口了。</p>

<h3>家庭如何購置家具</h3>
<p>莉萍</p>
<p>在現今這個時代，組織一個家庭，置不是一件容易事，單就家庭內的一切佈置說，已是够研究的了，現在談談家庭如何佈置家具，想讀者也很樂聞吧！</p>
<p>家庭內的佈置，以家具為主，家具購置得如果得宜，不但節省經濟，並且能增加生活的舒適，今擇最主要的條件，說明如左：</p>
<p>（一）經濟　在此百物騰貴的時候，木料也不能例外，因此，組織家庭用的家具，費用一定是很大的，如果為了初婚和將結婚的熱戀，而不顧一切的儘量購買以獻媚對方，釀成將來經濟的恐慌，實在是大謬的事。所以在組織家庭之先，先擇幾樣最需用的家具購買，那些不急需用的，可以分月購買，如此，在經濟不裕的時候，是再好也沒有的了。</p>
<p>（二）實用　有用的正當消費才算對的，反之，則流於奢侈浪費之途了，常見舊式家庭內的家具，多趨於笨重，所謂「莊嚴大派」，是他們的主張，因此有許多不實用的東西每天空放着，這正如從前鄉下的愚人將錢埋在地底下一樣的可笑。現在這時代，不但不能得到他人的贊揚，反而會使人看了感覺得厭煩，經濟來源一旦斷絕時，又得將它賣掉，看拍賣行裹的那些木器，不都是這樣來的嗎？道是多麼不聰明，靑年的夫婦們，應該信這句話吧</p>
<p>（三）藝術　家庭旣然是日常起居之處，家具也就是日常所接觸的東西，如果在家具的形態上，顏色上，加以理想需要的研究，那末將要得到它們不可言狀的安慰，普通木器的顏色，大的全是棕色的，黑色的，其形態不外是方的，圓的，長方的，半圓的，不過用途有限，自己對於形態，顏色可以自由挑揀心裏所喜歡的，總之，家具要小巧，簡單，美觀，這些條件，更要基於經濟。</p>
<h3>「要命　　　　偷光了！</h3>
<h3>歐戰三巨頭的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 木風</p>
<p>——張伯倫，達拉第，莫錫　——</p>
<p>第二次歐洲大戰又告爆發了，全球人士無日不在關懷着戰局的發展，而且更全神注視着三巨頭的行蹤和舉動。在這裹，且把他們的衣食任行來拉雜談談。</p>
<p>衣　張伯倫和逹拉第都有一件很名貴的衣服，原來在一九三四年英王喬治六世行加冕典禮時，因了張伯倫對於這决典禮的佈置及籌備方面，會用去極大的心思和精神。後來英王喬治對他非常感激，就把藏在白金漢宮中的一塊銀熊皮替他做了件晚禮服，據說這熊皮是羅馬尼亞國王贈給英王的，所以現在每當冬季，如果張伯倫要覲見英王時，他是常常穿了這熊皮禮服前去的。至於逹拉第，他於五年前會在巴黎購到一件價値二千六百法郞的松金鼠衣，（松金鼠產在立陶宛國，但產量極少，故稱名貴。）每逢重大宴會或出外打獵時，逹拉第往往穿着的。至於莫錫基，他不喜歡穿衣要如何漂亮，他的衣服極整潔，但質料却和中上階級一樣的，所以他的儉樸，是全世界的元首中所少見的。</p>
<p>食　張伯倫喜歡吃里沃斯火雞，及古林果，（是葆沙尼亞的名產）大概每决由葆國開來的郵船，不時有這東西載來的。除張伯倫外，哈里法克斯外相也所酷嗜的。逹拉第和莫錫基的對於吃，却極隨便，但逹拉第有一嗜好，就是喜吃南斯拉夫所產的立根琴葡萄。</p>
<p>住　張伯倫除了在倫敦有華麗的官邸外，他在狄威司奧頓鎮的私邸，建造得非常輝煌，有人估計它的價値至少在八百萬金鎊之上，由此就可想而知了。逹拉第除了總理府外，私邸有五處之多，但其華麗程度，却遠不及張伯倫的私邸。而莫錫基呢？他終年往在華沙的琴台納亞總理府中，而且卷屬也都住在一起的，他沒有一座私邸，眞是任何元首中所僅見的。</p>
<p>行　張伯倫是個旅行家，他不時携了洋傘來往奔波，而逹拉第却是個酷愛音樂的，他喜歡在戲院中聽戲，或者高唱名歌，而以儉樸耐勞著稱於世的莫錫基呢？因為他是個獵人的兒子，幼時就以打獵為生活，所以現在他也把獵獸作為僅有的嗜好了。（本文承央使館黃參事給予資料甚多，特此感謝。）</p>

<h3>對於平糶的幾點意見</h3>
<p>— 殷三郞</p>
<p>編者先生：社會各團體及虞洽卿氏等向西貢訂購的洋米，首批一萬八千包巳經到滬，除以一萬包救濟難民外，餘八千包決定辦理平糶，已由米業公會在兩租界內設立五個平糶處，開始平糶。我們對於各團體的熱心關懷，嘉惠平民，確是感到萬分欽佩的，但我們却有幾點意見，希望當局能够設法改善，而使逹到眞正嘉惠平民的目的。</p>
<p>（一）平糶處在英法租界只設立五處，實嫌太少，以致因極度擁擠而發生慘劇等，故希望能够多多設立平糶的處所。</p>
<p>（二）為了要挽救上面的缺陷，我們的意見是不妨委託各米店來辦理平糶，但須每天規定若千包為限，縱使有人今天不獲購買，但明天就有買到的希望，這樣不僅可以解除過份擁擠的危險，且能多予貧民購買的機會。</p>
<p>（三）現在是是新米登塲之際，而米價仍舊未見回跌，必定有奸商在故意橾縱，所以一方面固然消極的辦理平糶來救濟貧民，但常局還應該積極的嚴予偵查囤積居奇的奸商，同時，更要繼續不斷的擴大訂購洋米，因為這樣可以使米價漸漸抑平而回跌。</p>
<h3>卡德路上平糶速寫</h3>
<p>— 病大蟲</p>
<p>淸晨，太陽躱在雲裹，陰沉沉的，好像大雨欲來之勢。卡德路上擠滿了人頭，老的少的，男的女的，有携籃，有拿袋，向糶米的空塲裹湧，眞像秋潮泛濫。有許多奶臭未乾的小孩子，像小鴨子一樣，跟着潮水飄流，還有好多白髮老頭子，小脚老太婆，像一羣老水牛，經不起在潮冲擊，靠在籬笆上嘆息。</p>
<p>那向，來幾個黃衣警士，提着木棍，想趕去這些小鴨或老牛，豈知他們大概是餓荒了，寗願受挨打，還是向前湧。、那位西捕搖着頸，靈機一動，令巡捕把籬門關起來，讓人們望着那「米號業公會第二區平糶處」的白布旗很矯傲的飛舞着，可是還有一羣仍不願一功虧一簧」的等着。一位鬚子雪白的老頸兒，坐在路邊嘆道：「唉！早上五點半等起，到現在早點心都沒有吃，家中還有媳婦孫子等我的「米」回去做飯哩！」攤開手望望手中的一張法幣，己經汗水濕透，揑成一團糟了。傍邊一個骨瘦如柴的小夥子，聽了這話，上去和這位老頭兒說「老爸爸，你還是回去吧，你看，我們小夥子都擠不上，慢說是你？……」老卯子對他白了一眼，搖搖頭，說：『不，儂餓！我不餓？」一會兒桑嘆道：「窮人只有餓死！』</p>
<p>無軌電車「鐺鐺」的饗，流綫型的汽車被人潮擋着，喇叭鳴嗚地有什麽用呢？「阿二！啥事體？」是後面的女太太問汽車夫。「買强米！」「唔！啥事體勿早點多買點堆在屋裏：…」</p>
<p>籬笆外的人，向籬裹的人張望，口涎滴滴地很是羨慕，其實塲裹人爭先恐後，擠了半天，瞧不見一粒米，我望着你的空籃，你看着我的察袋，作會心的嘆息與苦笑。一個大肚子的女人受不住了，嘰哩咕嚕的呌道：『這不是買米，這呌作孽！」對把守大門的巡捕說：「我不買了，我要出去！」但是為了外面人太多，恐怕門開了湧了進來，所以不讓她出去，她還在嚷着……。</p>

<h3>躬蹈遺棄罪戾　棄孩　造成永遠悲劇</h3>
<p>— （白華）</p>
<p>有一個時期，上海的馬路上隨時發現被人拋棄的屍孩，有的捲着破絮，有的覆了一張報紙，甚至赤身露體拋在街頭牆角。藍十字會的埋屍車每天在各馬路巡視，為這些死無葬身之地的孩子們運去掩埋。同時，育嬰堂的接孩箱，也是鈴聲大振，許多活潑可愛的孩子，被他們苦命的父母拋棄了。</p>
<p>苦難的孩子！無論生的死的，都遭遇着同樣的命運！</p>
<p>天下沒有不愛子女的父母。懷孕時間，做母親的時刻留意着身體的健康，恐怕影響了他們未來的子女；呱呱墮地以後，又怎樣悉心愛護，希望他早日長成。誰忍心把初生下地的孩子，送到那黑暗的接孩箱去，而終身將不知他們的父母？即使是不幸而死了，也誰忍心讓那純潔的靈魂拋棄在街頭牆角呢？</p>
<p>但是生活的艱難，鞭策着他們造成殘忍的悲劇。當他們將自己的孩子放到接孩箱去，顫抖的手拉着繩鈴時，你知道做父母的流着世界上最眞情的眼淚嗎？他們是喃喃地禱告着：</p>
<p>「孩子！請你原諒做爹媽的忍心，送你到一個陌生的世界去。但是孩干！與其跟着苦命的爹媽餓死，還是……他們會扶養你長大成人，或許有仁人君子認領你出去，……可是你將永安不知道你的生身父母了！……」</p>
<p>是的，為孩子的未來計，與其餓死，不如各自投生；至於死的被拋棄在街頭牆角，那不過是良心問題，可是現在在生與死之問，尚有更慘絕人寰的事實放在面前，報載：</p>
<p>本埠白利南路同仁醫院，屢决發現親父母故意遺棄親孩事件，實為社會上之嚴重問題。茲據悉本年八月十日，有自稱居住大西路二十五號之荀姓人家，將四歲親生女孩名洪仙者，送該院求治。乃於託付該孩後，該親父母從未前往探視，迄今業逾月餘，及經調查，則大西路二十五號並無苟姓人家。現同仁醫院以該親父母或者故意遺棄，即準備全權安置。但仍希望該親父母於二星期內，前往認領，以完骨肉（可免去所有醫藥費）。否則，該父母將躬蹈遺棄罪戾，造成永遠悲劇云。</p>
<p>這姓荀的人家，旣沒有拋棄這孩子於前，扶養到四歲，而又遺棄於醫院在後，可見做父母的是在怎樣困難的情况下扶植着這孩子，直到他們沒有辦法為這孩子醫治疾病，而又不忍他尚有一錢生機的時候死去，才把這孩子的生命交給了醫院。「迄今業逾月餘，從未前往探望」，可不知該父母日夜盼望着這孩子的早日痊愈，或許還夢想着有團圓的一天呢，而竟造成了永遠悲劇！</p>
<p>這兩年之中，多少孩子慘死於炸彈大砲之下，多少孩子在受着奴化的敎育，在比較運幸能託庇於租界保護之下的孩子，也遭遇到如此悲劇的命運！</p>
<p>「造成永遠悲劇」是事實，而誰願「躬蹈遺棄罪戾」呢？</p>
<p>救救孩子，救救孩子罷！</p>
<h3>答朱卓丞君</h3>
<p>編輯先生大鑒，頃閱一新食譜」承朱卓丞君詢及麥粉和豆腐渣和食，需水多少一節，查此項食品，本在非常時期之急救辦法，其製做方法，與普通之大餅麺條相彷彿，如再加少許發粉，亦能製成菜饅頭，牛肉餃子等類，惟人口時味較純麥粉為粗，如能將豆腐渣洒乾，再磨成為粉末，則可與純麥紛之味無異矣。　顧忠謹上</p>

<h3>電燈（機械詩話）</h3>
<p>— 如晦</p>
<p>在這裹，是正面的指出了，電燈所以如此光耀，是並沒有什麽神秘，祇是「電氣」作用而已。也大概由於知道了這祗是「電氣」作用，並沒有什麽「魔怪」作用，於是，禁用電燈的命令，在不久以後，就取消了。「申江名勝圖說」（一八八四）第四十九圖「電氣燈懸光明如畫」云：</p>
<p>……近有英人立德，又剏設電氣燈，皎潔輝煌……其色淡白，宛如天上月輪，宛照大千，鬚眉畢現。初時當事者誤於謠諑，出示禁止。嗣悉用之有利無害，其禁遂弛。近則戲館，茗寮，酒樓，烟室，無不光明照耀，火樹花繁，不夜城開，無俟燭龍燄吐矣。……</p>
<p>其圓則繪一乘車女子，掀車後簾，以驚奇眼光，呆視着街燈。而車夫反拂一紙糊燈籠與俱，相映成趣。不過，敏感的究竟要推詩人，他們對「電燈」，是不止於「驚奇」，且還能「有感」。如曹孔昭「新樂府」四首之一詠「電氣燈」：排空馭氣園作毬，如鏡之懸如星流。泰西技巧臻絕妙，以電為燈自他耀。書然有聲虚空白，晶光上下熒熒射。即使天陰塵翳晦，黃昏搖蕩蟾蜍彩。初疑謪仙人，入海撈月來，廣寒宮闕隨地開。還疑博望侯，摘星從大下，珠璧淸輝塡廣厦。嗚呼雷鞭掣動譙樓鼓，不照飢寒照歌舞。</p>
<p>這感慨是極其合理的。因在當時的經濟條件之下，除掉歌樓舞榭，富豪之家外，平民人家，有誰裝得起這樣新奇而輝煌的燈火呢？……（本節完）</p>

        <h1>1939.09.18</h1>
<h3>International Changes Increasingly Difficult to Grasp - Soviet Troops Suddenly Invade Poland - Under the Pretext of Protecting White Russians and Ukrainians - Poland Rejects Soviet Ultimatum and Resists</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital - The Polish semi-official agency, the Polish Telegraph Agency, has just broadcast a message stating that the Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov received the Polish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Grzybowski, at 3 a.m. this morning, and read him a note stating that the Soviet government has ordered the Red Army to enter Poland at 10 a.m. this morning. Ambassador Grzybowski immediately and firmly rejected this and lodged a strong protest. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London - The Soviet government sent a note to the Polish Ambassador last night, informing him that the Red Army intended to enter Poland, and stated that in order to protect its own interests and to protect the White Russian and Ukrainian minorities in eastern Poland, the Soviet government had ordered the Red Army to cross the Soviet-Polish border at 6 a.m. this morning (Moscow time), from Polotsk in the north to Kamenets-Podolsk in the south, advancing simultaneously along the entire line. This action does not affect the neutrality that the Soviet Union adheres to in the current war. The German-Polish war has shown the corruption of the Polish state and its government. In the past ten days, Poland has completely lost its industrial areas and cultural centers. Warsaw no longer exists as a capital. The Polish government has disintegrated. Therefore, all treaties signed between the Soviet Union and Poland have become invalid. The Soviet government intends to take various measures to allow the Polish people, who have suffered from the war due to the misguidance of their leaders, to escape the scourge of war and to give them the opportunity to start a peaceful life. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London - The Polish Embassy has just announced that Polish troops have resisted Soviet troops near Mława in the north. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London - Soviet sources here have stated that after the German troops attacked Poland, they advanced rapidly. The new weapons they used were very effective in good weather. All of this was unexpected by the Soviet government. In addition, according to reliable Polish sources, the German government has decided to send as many as 6,000 aircraft to fight in Poland. Under these circumstances, it is only right that the Soviet government mobilizes reserves to avoid having to transfer troops stationed in the central and northwestern regions to defend the western border. In short, the Soviet government has taken two military measures recently: (1) As the German troops are advancing rapidly, the Soviet Union must prepare for any eventuality. (2) Once the German troops have completely defeated the Polish resistance, if the Ukrainians in Poland ask the Soviet Union for assistance, the Soviet government may consider how to provide assistance. After all, the Little Russia and Ukraine regions were lands seized from the Soviet Union by Poland in the 1920s. The Soviet government certainly intends to recover them. In this way, it may advocate the formation of a "puppet Polish state," regardless of the wishes of the Little Russian and Ukrainian ethnic groups, and directly protect them. If so, the entire status of Poland will naturally become the focus of discussion. In any case, the Soviet government is determined to pursue an independent policy and not be swayed by Germany. In other words, during Germany's conquest of Poland, the Soviet Union has its own due interests, but it will not help Germany. On the contrary, if the German troops advance beyond a certain limit and put pressure on the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union will resist. Therefore, in order to avoid friction between the Soviet Union and Germany, it is best to establish a buffer state. As for Romania, the Soviet government should adopt the same attitude towards it. In other words, if Germany invades the country eastward, the Soviet Union should take what it deserves and occupy the Bessarabia province of the country (on the Black Sea coast, which belonged to Russia before the last European war). In short, no matter what action Germany takes, the Soviet Union will never miss an opportunity to abandon its interests. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris - Diplomatic circles here believe that after the Soviet Union concentrated troops on the Polish border, it reached a ceasefire agreement with Japan on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia border dispute, which shows that the country intends to be able to act freely in Europe. However, it is doubtful whether this agreement will last. As far as Japan is concerned, the troops stationed on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia border can now be transferred to China to fight, but their effectiveness is very limited. It can be asserted that the war between Japan and China will still be difficult to end quickly. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, it can take advantage of the ceasefire with Japan to take action in Europe. German propaganda organs have brazenly portrayed this agreement as the first step towards close relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. In fact, after Germany and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression treaty and abandoned the Anti-Comintern Pact, Japan's true intentions may not be known to Germany. Well-informed sources say that the Soviet Union's main forces on the western front are concentrated in the Minsk-Brest area, opposite Poland's "Vilnius Corridor" (near Lithuania), which shows that the Soviet Union's first goal is not the Ukrainian region of Poland, but the provinces in Poland where Russian minorities live. As for the Baltic countries, their position has also been shaken. When the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union were conducting military talks to negotiate a mutual assistance agreement, the Baltic countries, like Poland, not only refused to accept Soviet assistance, but also felt deep fear of the Soviet government. Up to now, the unease of the governments of these countries is to be expected. According to German sources, Germany and the Soviet Union have reached a complete compromise on the political methods that Eastern European countries should adopt in the future. In other words, Latvia and Estonia will be annexed by the Soviet Union, and Lithuania will nominally retain its independence and recover its old territory from Poland (including Vilnius). The Soviet government will then use the pretext of internal changes in a certain province of Poland to occupy it, so as not to be accused of being an aggressor. At the same time, Romania will have no excuse to assist Poland. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Moscow - Well-informed political sources here recently said that the Soviet government will not take any action against Poland as long as the Polish resistance is not destroyed by Germany and the Polish government retains considerable military strength. It is very possible that the Soviet government may be forced to make a major decision in the near future. Foreign observers believe that the reason why the Soviet Union initially agreed to sign a non-aggression treaty with Germany was because the country strongly stated that the United Kingdom and France would not go to war, so the Soviet Union could stay out of the matter. Until today, Germany is still trying to insinuate to the Soviet Union that the United Kingdom and France have no intention of fighting for a long time. Once Poland collapses, these countries will quickly make peace with Germany. Their intention is probably to suddenly ask the Soviet Union, "Do you want to be our friend or our enemy?" when their troops are approaching the Soviet border, in order to force the Soviet Union to submit. This is not impossible. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>Molotov Announces - Cannot Maintain Neutrality - Polish Military and Government Have Collapsed - Urgent Need to Send Troops to Save Compatriots</h3>
<p>Moscow - Molotov broadcast a speech at 11:30 a.m. on September 17, saying, "Comrades and citizens of the whole country, the events after the outbreak of the German-Polish war have revealed the collapse of the internal affairs of Poland and its insignificance. The Polish ruling class has gone bankrupt. All of this happened in a very short period of time. Poland has lost all of its industrial centers and most of its major cities and cultural centers in two weeks. Warsaw is no longer the capital of Poland. No one knows where the Polish government is now. The Polish people have been abandoned by their unfortunate leaders and left to the mercy of fate. Poland as a country and its government no longer exist in fact. Therefore, the various treaties signed between the Soviet Union and Poland are no longer valid. A situation has arisen in Poland that requires the Soviet government to pay special attention to the security of its own country. Poland has become a fertile ground for various unexpected changes to occur, which will endanger the Soviet Union. Until the last moment, the Soviet government originally maintained neutrality, but the above-mentioned circumstances are such that the Soviet government cannot continue to maintain a neutral attitude towards the situation that has occurred. The Soviet government cannot sit idly by and ignore its Ukrainian and White Russian compatriots who are now living in Poland. These compatriots were originally ethnic groups without any rights, and now they are all left to the mercy of fate. The Soviet government believes that it is its sacred duty to assist its Ukrainian and White Russian compatriots living in Poland. Therefore, the Soviet government sent a note to the Polish ambassador in Moscow this morning, announcing that the Soviet government had instructed the High Command of the Red Army to order troops to cross the border and assume the responsibility of protecting the lives and property of Western Ukrainians and Western White Russians. The Soviet government also stated in the note that the government also intends to take all steps to save the Polish people who have been plunged into war by Poland's unwise leaders and to give them the opportunity to enjoy a peaceful life. When the Red Army reserves in the Ukrainian, White Russian, and other four military districts were partially mobilized in early September, the situation in Poland was still unclear, so it was originally a precautionary step. At that time, no one could have expected that Poland would be so weak and collapse so quickly. Now that this collapse has become a reality and the Polish politicians have completely exposed their bankruptcy and cannot reverse the situation in Poland, the Red Army, which has strengthened its forces after partially mobilizing reserves, must satisfactorily perform its glorious duties. The government firmly believes that our Workers' and Peasants' Red Army will be able to demonstrate its combat effectiveness, awareness, and discipline at this time, and will be able to show new heroic and glorious achievements in carrying out its great liberation mission. The Soviet government has also sent copies of the note sent to the Polish ambassador to the governments of all countries that currently have diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. At the same time, it is declared that the Soviet Union will continue to maintain a neutral policy towards these countries. This is what determines the recent steps in our country's foreign policy. The government is now making the following statement to the citizens of the whole country. During this mobilization of reserves, some citizens showed a tendency to hoard food and other goods, fearing that a rationing system might be implemented. The government must now declare that there is absolutely no intention of implementing a rationing system for food and manufactured goods, even if the national steps that must be taken due to foreign events must be extended for a certain period of time. I mean, the result of hoarding unnecessary food and goods will be that the hoarders themselves will be harmed, because the hoarded goods will rot. We have sufficient supplies of everything our country needs, and there is no need for a rationing system. Our task, the task of all workers, peasants, employees, and intellectuals, is to faithfully sacrifice ourselves in our respective positions to engage in work, thereby assisting the Red Army. As for our heroic Red Army, I firmly believe that they will gloriously and satisfactorily complete their duties to the country. Now, all the ethnic groups and all the citizens of our Soviet Union, and all the soldiers of our Red Army, Navy, and Air Force are united as never before to support the government, support the Bolshevik Party, and support the great leader Comrade Stalin. From now on, we will accomplish new and unprecedented successes in labor, industry, and collective farms, as well as new glorious victories for the army on the front lines. (TASS dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Baltic Coast - Small Countries Uneasy - Romania Also Panicked</h3>
<p>Latvian Capital - The news of the Soviet troops entering the eastern border of Poland has surprised all the Baltic countries. Political figures here solemnly stated that Latvia has always maintained friendly relations with the Soviet Union, and the Soviet Union's advance into Poland should not affect the relations between the Soviet Union and Latvia. In addition, Latvia has unconditionally strictly adhered to neutrality in the German-Polish war, and it is believed that the Soviet Union will respect the neutral status of the Baltic countries. According to news from the Lithuanian capital, this move by the Soviet government has also greatly shocked the people of the country. The Vilnius issue has been raised again, and the situation is serious. The saying that the residents of the Vilnius region will declare their union with Poland has not yet been confirmed. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Latvian Capital - According to news from foreign sources, the Soviet government has recently approached the Latvian government, requesting permission to use the port of Ventspils (on the Baltic coast). The semi-official Latvian News Agency has just issued a message, officially denying this. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Lithuanian Capital - Lithuanian Prime Minister Mironas declared when opening the autumn session of the parliament today, stating Lithuania's determination to strictly adhere to neutrality in the future, saying that the current situation requires the nation to be tempered, united, and determined. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital - The official here has not yet formally announced the news of the Soviet troops entering Poland. Although political figures are extremely anxious, they also believe that since the Soviet Union has declared that it will continue to maintain neutrality in the current war, it can be paid attention to. However, they are afraid that the Ukrainian minority in Romania will take the opportunity to riot. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Romanian Capital - According to reliable sources here today, Romania notified Poland before the outbreak of the German-Polish war that if Poland was at war with a third country and was also attacked by the Soviet Union, Romania could not assist Poland because of the military alliance it had concluded with Poland in 1921. Because under the current circumstances, for Romania to come out and assist Poland would be tantamount to suicide for Romania itself, and at the same time, Romania's assistance would not benefit Poland in any way. According to political observations here, the Balkan countries may be able to maintain neutrality throughout. The Turkish Foreign Minister's decision to reciprocate a visit to Moscow may lead to the conclusion of a German-Turkish non-aggression treaty. Diplomatic circles all believe that in addition to the non-aggression treaty, Germany and the Soviet Union also have secret agreements on their respective spheres of influence.

<h3>Soviet Union Submits Notes to Various Countries</h3>
<p>Moscow - The original text of the note that the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, read to the Polish Ambassador Grzybowski this morning has been copied and sent to the envoys of various countries stationed in the Soviet Union. The content is the same as the speech of the country's Foreign Minister Molotov. (Havas</p>
<p>Moscow - The full text of the note from the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Molotov, to the Polish Ambassador Grzybowski has been published. It states, "The possibility of the existence of Poland's internal institutions has disappeared. This has been proven by the German-Polish war. Since the beginning of the war, only eighteen days have passed, and all of Poland's industrial areas and cultural centers have been destroyed. Warsaw is no longer the capital, and the Polish government is lifeless. Its country and government no longer exist in fact. It can be seen that the treaties previously signed between Poland and the Soviet Union have also lost their validity. In short, Poland, without a leader to command, has become a place where all kinds of accidental and unexpected events can occur, which is enough to threaten the Soviet Union. Although the Soviet government has been neutral, it can no longer maintain neutrality because of these circumstances. Moreover, the Ukrainian and White Russian people in Poland have blood ties with the Soviet Union, and it is inappropriate to allow them to be displaced and lose their protection. Yuan has ordered the Red Army authorities to send troops to Poland to protect the lives and property of the residents in the western parts of the Ukrainian and White Russian regions, and at the same time take various measures to liberate the Polish people and prevent them from continuing to be given by the unjust authorities and continuing this unfortunate war, so as to start a stable and carefree life."

<h3>French Minelayer Explodes and Burns - More Than a Hundred People Die</h3>
<p>Paris - Rumors that a French warship was hit by a torpedo from a German submarine have been denied by the responsible party, who said that a French minelayer exploded in a certain port, causing it to burn. About one hundred officers and soldiers died. The various rumors probably refer to this matter. (Havas dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>British Navy Intercepts Large Quantities of German Contraband</h3>
<p>London - According to a telegram from the Intelligence Department today, the contraband intercepted by the British Navy in the week ending September 9 that was being transported to Germany included 28,600 tons of kerosene. During this week, a large number of iron sand, manganese sand, wooden paddles, and phosphoric acid were also intercepted. According to people in the oil industry, before the war, Germany could only supply one-third of the kerosene it needed during peacetime. Germany also felt a great shortage of iron sand, and at least two-thirds of the quantity it needed had to be imported from abroad. Most of the manganese needed by Germany was imported from abroad, and phosphoric acid, a major fertilizer, also depended entirely on foreign supplies. Most of these restricted goods were shipped before the war, so there is evidence that they were transported to German ports. Now, because the London Prize Court has not yet opened, they are being kept by the Admiralty and can be ordered to be sold. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<h3>British Warship Pursues German Submarine - Details of Oil Tanker Disaster</h3>
<p>London - The crew of the British and American oil tanker Checque, which was bombed by a German submarine, arrived ashore today and told reporters in detail about the bombing by the German submarine, saying that after the German submarine fired a warning shot, they escaped in a lifeboat, and the submarine commander was willing to tow the lifeboat to the Irish coast until a ship came to rescue them. But as the oil tanker was being shelled, a British destroyer suddenly rushed to the scene, and the German submarine immediately submerged and fled. The British warship fired depth charges to attack it, and then sank the oil tanker, because the ship had been destroyed and would be a hazard to navigation if it remained on the surface. All 37 members of the oil tanker's crew landed in lifeboats without any casualties. (Reuters dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>Tokyo - The German Hamburg-America Line freighter Wöddenhörn immediately changed its route in the Pacific Ocean after the outbreak of the war and arrived in Yokohama yesterday. It was found that the ship was originally sailing from the west coast of the United States, but when it was only 800 miles from the port, the captain was afraid that the American authorities would detain it, so he changed its course and sailed to Japan. When it arrived in Japan, it only had a few tons of fuel left. (Reuters dispatch, 17th</p>
<p>Berlin - According to news received today, when a German submarine was searching the British ship "Vanadis" on the 14th of this month, a British aircraft carrier sent two aircraft to attack. The German submarine immediately fired anti-aircraft guns and shot them down. The two pilots were rescued. (Haitong dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Danish Ship Sinks After Hitting Mine</h3>
<p>Flushing - It was learned today that the Danish ship Randhof-Bacher, on its way to Antwerp, Belgium, sank after hitting a mine outside Texel Island in the Dutch West Frisian Islands on September 30. A lifeboat rescued 20 people, who landed here, including four Americans. Seventeen people are still missing, including four Americans. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Dutch Ship Also Sinks</h3>

<h3>How Will the United Kingdom and France Respond - Is This Move by the Soviet Union Aggression - London Has Not Yet Decided</h3>
<p>London - Regarding the matter of the Soviet troops entering Poland, the British Intelligence Department is waiting for official news so that it can publicly state its position. The Polish Embassy is currently in close contact with its government. The country's government has not yet decided whether it considers this move by the Soviet Union to be direct aggression. In any case, it should be dealt with by "symbolic resistance." However, although Poland may allow the Soviet Union to temporarily annex some land, it will still have the right to demand its return in the future. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>London - Soviet sources here have explained the matter of the Soviet troops entering Poland, saying that there are currently 8 million Ukrainians and 3 million Little Russians in Poland, and they should be returned to their motherland and should not be ruled by Germany. The Polish government "no longer exists," and the Soviet-Polish non-aggression treaty has expired. The Soviet Union should take the opportunity to "recover" the areas inhabited by the Ukrainian and Little Russian ethnic groups that it lost in 1920. British political figures say that the Soviet Union intends to make Poland a small buffer state with a population of 18 million (Poland currently has a population of 35 million) in order to realize Germany's plan. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>Germany and the Soviet Union Will Also Find It Difficult to Get Along</h3>
<p>Moscow - A reporter for the New York Post Forum has sent a message from the border between Poland and Romania, saying that the Soviet troops must stop advancing once they reach the areas inhabited by the Ukrainian and White Russian ethnic groups. However, it is doubtful whether the German troops will be happy to do so, because the Galician province inhabited by the Ukrainian ethnic group is an oil-producing area, and it is feared that Germany may not be willing to give it up.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Expectations for Present-Day Japan</h3>
<p>After prolonged weakness and chaos, China has been cutting through thorns and brambles, reforming and innovating, only to see a glimmer of dawn and a promising future. However, a powerful neighbor, driven by envy, has resorted to violent aggression, encroaching deeper and deeper, inch by inch, threatening to engulf the Divine Land. This has forced this country and its people to endure immense suffering, brave the clash of weapons, and continue to struggle and fight to this day. At that time, Japan had been undergoing the Meiji Restoration for over sixty years (counting from the ascension of Emperor Meiji in 1868 to 1930, a period of sixty-three years), internally striving for good governance, strengthening its military, and externally triumphing over Russia and Germany, distinguishing itself prominently and joining the ranks of the world's great powers. Had it possessed foresight, upheld benevolence and righteousness, supported the weak and small, and fostered harmony with neighboring countries, it could have gained the support of Heaven and people, becoming a veritable leader of the Far East, comparable to the United States in the Americas. However, driven by the ambition of a wolf, it has harbored intentions of annexation, driving its sons and exhausting its wealth, ultimately sinking into a quagmire from which it cannot extricate itself. In the beginning, if various nations had been able to recognize the necessity of upholding international justice, the impermissibility of condoning militaristic aggression, apply the principles of the League of Nations, implement the guarantees of the Nine-Power Treaty, and fulfill the sacred obligations of treaties and alliances by taking effective action to suppress violence and coercion, then the force of a thunderbolt would have certainly corrected the error, punished one to warn a hundred, and curbed the budding chaos. However, due to inaction and procrastination, and engaging in superficial compromises, the rights and interests of all nations were ultimately eroded, and the international order collapsed from that point onward. The current war in Europe is also caused by aggression; the Far East was the first to initiate this trend, and the origins are deeply rooted. Alas, the spark started in Liaoning, and from September 18, 1930, to this day, this year, a full nine years have passed. Looking back at the international turmoil of the past nine years and imagining the endless calamities and continued warfare to come, who can restrain themselves from boundless lamentation!</p>
<p>He who tied the bell must untie it; the one who can initiate and conclude can only be spoken of as possessing great wisdom and courage. The responsibility for the Sino-Japanese war rests entirely with Japan from the beginning, as the world's opinion unanimously condemns it. Even now, what China sacrifices everything to seek is by no means revenge, but merely the recovery of its territory and the preservation of its sovereignty. The moment the Japanese troops withdraw, it will be the time for reconciliation and amity. Therefore, the key to the future still lies with Japan. But what seems to be the wisdom and courage of Japan? Just a week ago, Japan was still adjusting the structure of its invading forces in China, strengthening the command of its invading forces in China, and establishing a commander-in-chief. Three to five days ago, Japan's plans to launch a new offensive spread far and wide. In the north, Japanese military vehicles were constantly moving and deploying troops. There were also rumors of Japanese warships soon blockading the mouth of Wenzhou. All these military indications demonstrate the continuation of its aggression. The new Japanese Prime Minister Abe recently announced his political platform, focusing all his diplomatic, domestic administrative, financial, and political efforts on dealing with the so-called China Incident. Furthermore, the newspapers and magazines under his control continue to deceive the eyes and ears of his people, numb their spirits, and spur them on to pursue the illusory grand ambition of aggression. From the perspective of Japan's internal dynamics, this remains the consistent approach of the past nine years, even becoming more intensified. In short, there is still no sign of a complete change of course, as it is far from possessing so-called great wisdom and courage. Moreover, just yesterday, it reached an agreement with the Soviet Union to cease border hostilities, allowing Japan to alleviate the threat it felt from the Soviet Union. Yesterday, the Soviet Union suddenly announced the dispatch of troops to invade Poland, abruptly giving the impression that the European war was approaching a world war. In effect, the Soviet Union comforted Japan with its actions, assuring it that it need not worry about the Soviet Union. This recent attitude of the Soviet Union is likely to stimulate Japan's aggressive consciousness, making it even more emboldened. Therefore, the nine-year period has only been a process of a spark igniting a prairie fire. On this day, this year, not only is there nothing better than at that time, but the quality and scale of the chaos are even greater and more severe.</p>
<p>However, the greater and more severe the quality and scale of the chaos, the more it is believed that all parties need to calmly consider the present and future of China, Japan, and the Far East. In the midst of great and severe chaos, what kind of position do China and Japan occupy? When resolving the chaos in the future, what weight will China and Japan have? This so-called position and weight are related to the future decades and centuries of fortune and misfortune for both countries. Will the decision of this position and weight be left to the emotional desires of the moment? Will it be left to the surging waves of the world? Or will it appeal to its own wisdom, autonomously seek to raise its position, and increase its weight? In China, the answer is simple and clear: everything is based on the nation and its people, and the nation and its people come first. In response to aggression, the only answer is resistance to protect the nation and its people. Once the nation and its people stand tall, and the external threat of aggression disappears, China will naturally raise its position and increase its weight in the world chaos. As long as aggression does not disappear, resistance will not stop for a single day. Those who say that resistance should not be waged only have two arguments: one, that China is willing to be destroyed; and two, that Japan is not committing aggression. The former, that it is willing to be destroyed, is impossible in reason and principle. The latter, that it is not committing aggression, can never be forcefully argued based on all of Japan's actions and theories before today. At this time and in this situation, if China willingly admits that it is not aggression, then it means nothing other than expressing a willingness to be destroyed. At this time and in this situation, if Japan still wants to forcefully argue that it is not aggression, then it means nothing other than expressing its determination to continue its aggression. Furthermore, what urgently needs to be calmly considered is not the question of whether Japan's actions before today were aggression; but because the quality and scale of world chaos are already severe and vast, if Japan continues its aggression in this chaos, will it raise its position, or will it ultimately lower its position? Will it increase its weight by continuing its aggression, or will it reduce its weight by continuing its aggression? We do not believe that after calm consideration, Japan will reach a conclusion opposite to ours. However, seeking its actions to match its conclusion requires great wisdom, decisive action, and resolutely abandoning its aggression.</p>
<p>How wonderful it would be if this day of commemorating aggression could be the anniversary of Japan's renunciation of aggression every year from now on!</p>
<h3>German Troops Encircle Warsaw, Demand Surrender of Garrison, Issue Stern Ultimatum, Garrison Sends Envoys to Contact Germans</h3>
<p>London: German radio reports that Germany has issued an ultimatum demanding the surrender of Warsaw within twelve hours. German aircraft dropped leaflets containing this ultimatum over Warsaw at 3:10 PM yesterday. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to official sources here, an official gazette issued last night declared: "For several days, German troops have completely encircled Warsaw. The gates of the city and the outskirts of Warsaw are surrounded by German troops. Polish military commanders are now inciting the people of the entire city to rise up and fight in order to defend Warsaw. In order to avoid unnecessary destruction, German troops have refrained from using heavy artillery and have repeatedly exercised restraint. However, the limit has now been reached, and they are determined to put an end to this 'criminal activity' by Poland. In an effort to minimize losses to civilians in Warsaw, a German officer was sent to Warsaw at 8:00 AM on the 16th to request the surrender of the city without bloodshed from the city's authorities. The officer, carrying a flag of truce, arrived at the headquarters of the Polish cavalry regiment at 8:30 AM and requested to meet with the Warsaw garrison commander to present an official document. After waiting for an hour and a half, the response received was 'the commander refuses to see him.' The German officer then requested to have the official document forwarded, but this was also refused by the Polish troops. The commander-in-chief of the German troops outside Warsaw, believing that the people of Warsaw may not be aware of these facts, ordered the air force to drop millions of leaflets over Warsaw at 3:10 PM in the afternoon. The content of the leaflets was as follows: 'People of Warsaw, your government has turned the entire Warsaw into a battlefield. Your military authorities are ordering you to build fortifications and engage in guerrilla tactics, which is a violation of international law and turns the entire Warsaw into a battlefield. However, German troops, in accordance with the Führer's orders, are only bombing military strongholds, railways, airfields, barracks, ammunition factories, etc., and have made the following demands to the Warsaw military authorities: (1) The city of Warsaw must be handed over within twelve hours and occupied by German troops without bloodshed. (2) The Polish troops in Warsaw must also surrender to the German troops at the same time. (3) If Poland complies with these demands, the nearest German commander should be notified immediately. (4) If the demands are not accepted, then the people of Warsaw are limited to evacuating within twelve hours and taking refuge towards West-Dezgarowlin. Once the deadline expires, the entire city of Warsaw will become a battlefield, and various consequences will arise.'" The official gazette stated that this was the final warning to the military and civilians of Warsaw. If it is not accepted, then all losses and destruction in Warsaw should be borne solely by the current commanders of Warsaw. (Haitong Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: After the Warsaw garrison commander refused to meet with the German military envoy yesterday, he sent a telegram to the German command today, requesting a meeting with German commanding officer. The German commanding officer immediately telegraphed back, indicating acceptance. (Haitong Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The Polish garrison in Lviv put up a stubborn resistance against the advancing German troops yesterday. The German southern army has advanced to the outer walls of the city, threatening the city with mechanized units and bombers. The main force of the southern army has occupied Baraleier, and the main forces are concentrating in the vicinity. A German announcement issued yesterday afternoon stated: "The southern army is pursuing the routed Polish army. There is fighting in the Lemberg and Tannure River areas. German troops east of Baraleier have advanced to Shi Luoxi Miz. Polish troops in the Gute Nor area have been surrounded by German troops, and German reserve troops have joined them to increase their strength. Fierce battles continue around the castle of Brest-Litovsk." (Associated Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: A message issued by the German News Agency yesterday stated that Polish government officials had taken their families and fled to the Romanian border. The semi-official agency, Bard Telegraph Agency, denied this, saying that all government officials are actively preparing for the final victory near the General Headquarters and that their families are also working on civilian relief. In addition, on the 14th of this month, German aircraft bombed the children's hospital in the town of Odlevo Kv克 near Warsaw, killing a total of sixty children. The mental hospital in the area was also destroyed, and many lunatics escaped. A group of German motorized troops encountered rain in a certain area yesterday, and their fuel ran out, rendering them unable to move. As a result, they were completely wiped out, with 2,000 casualties. The remaining 1,200 troops were all captured, and forty-two tanks and eleven artillery pieces fell into the hands of the Polish army. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Capital of Latvia: A message broadcast by the semi-official Polish agency, Bard Telegraph Agency, was recently received here. It was learned that German aircraft bombed the city of Vilnius three times yesterday, dropping a total of 400 bombs, killing 20 residents and injuring 100. The wireless station was also damaged. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The semi-official agency, Bard Telegraph Agency, recently issued a message stating that the Polish troops are fighting bravely, outnumbered but not yielding. In addition to maintaining their existing positions, they have also been able to achieve local victories, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. The enemy has been repelled in successive attacks on Warsaw. The fighting is particularly fierce in the areas of Gute Nor, Lovice, and Skiernievice west of Warsaw. The enemy has suffered heavy losses and has had to increase reinforcements. The enemy's motorized troops in southeastern Poland have reached the upper reaches of the Bug River near Volochimeierz. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The Defense Headquarters recently issued a communiqué stating that the enemy artillery has heavily bombarded the central district of the city and attacked the town of Vula in the suburbs. However, after our troops met them head-on with a strong attack, they inflicted heavy damage, destroyed one tank, and captured 100 soldiers and one colonel. The enemy eventually retreated, unable to withstand the attack. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: This paper publishes articles from military experts criticizing the war in Poland, stating that the German strategy is to use armored forces to penetrate deep into Poland in order to destroy transportation and prevent the concentration of Polish troops. According to The Times, Warsaw has not been subjected to a strong attack from the west, but the fate of the Polish troops in the two regions of Posen and Pomerelia (western Poland) is not yet certain, as the Germans claim that these two places are the targets of a concentrated German attack. The advance of the German left wing, Kobleis Lytettovesk, seems to be slowing down, but the encirclement operation on the right wing is greatly expanding. Lublin is now under threat, but the German attack on Lviv is only a brief attack by one division of mechanized troops, which quickly withdrew, fearing the threat of encirclement. It is heard that the Germans are also suspected of probing Trohobik south of Lviv, but the pressure from this German route is also decreasing. According to news from the Polish-Romanian border, the northern Polish troops are currently fighting in conjunction with the troops in the Posen region. Zelershitsky and other military centers are maintaining "complete contact" with the Supreme Command. The wireless stations in Warsaw and Vilnius are still broadcasting without interruption. The Polish government is currently located in the Lviv region and is in constant contact with various ministries, exchanging telegrams with the headquarters and various resistance centers.

<h3>German Troops Advance, Southeastern Poland, Occupy Historic City</h3>
<p>(Polish-Romanian Border) Yesterday, German tanks and motorized troops advanced directly into southeastern Poland. The foreign diplomatic representatives stationed in Warsaw, upon the advice of the Polish government, have been taking refuge. The first group of personnel has already crossed the border into Romania. The British and French diplomatic representatives were the first to leave Salischaiqi. Although German troops have advanced to forty miles northeast of the city, Polish officials, including President Mosicki, are lingering in the city. Although German troops will launch an assault on the city, military observers believe that the German troops are advancing rapidly towards Tenopol (one hundred miles north inside Salischaiqi) near the Soviet border, attempting to cut off all contact between the Polish Ukrainian Alliance and other parts of Poland. The roads south of Lviv are congested with refugees fleeing to the Romanian border. The Associated Press reporter stationed at the German-Polish border in Sigusiaglevitz, Upper Silesia, reported last night that Germany has established customs along the German border of 1914. The move is to economically merge the industrial zone of eastern Upper Silesia with Germany. (Associated Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command issued a statement today stating that Lengbao has been surrounded on three sides, and the retreat route to the southeast of the Polish troops between Lengbao and Puzimase has been cut off. North of the confluence of the San River and the Vistula River, the German troops continued to advance towards Lublin. Lublin has been occupied by German troops, and the German troops have captured 100 undamaged aircraft. The outposts of the East Prussian army are directly connected with the troops in Upper Silesia and Slovakia. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: An official announcement this afternoon stated that German troops occupied the Brest-Litovsk citadel. The fortress in that area has fallen into the hands of the German army. Six hundred enemy soldiers were captured in the citadel. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>London: According to German communiqué, Brest-Litovsk, a Polish historic city 180 miles east of Warsaw, has now been occupied by German troops. The city is located at the confluence of the Bug and Merkkovitz rivers. In March 1918, the Soviet Union and Germany signed a separate peace treaty in that city. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Western Front First Major Battle: German Counterattack Heavily Damaged; Three-Pronged Attack Fails; French Control Saar River</h3>
<p>Paris: According to a French military communiqué, the first major battle since the outbreak of hostilities erupted yesterday on the Western Front. The German army suffered heavy losses. The battle took place between the Moselle River and Saarbrücken. The German forces launched a three-pronged attack with tanks, artillery, and aircraft against the French positions but were unsuccessful. German reinforcements attempted to dislodge the French forces occupying a certain mountain peak, as its position overlooked the Siegfried Line. However, French machine guns inflicted severe damage on the German troops. This was the first large-scale battle initiated by the Germans on the Western Front, but it resulted in even greater losses for them. The French military authorities are very satisfied with this victory. Authoritative sources state that this engagement was the first real test of French strength. Military observers believe that the French army will advance to occupy other mountain peaks as bases for attacking the Siegfried Line. According to the French communiqué, the German army is currently reinforcing the Western Front with heavy forces. As the German forces retreated from several villages, they destroyed them. The French forces made full use of tanks on the Western Front, inflicting damage on the German troops. The continuous retreat of the German forces indicates their failure to resist the French advance. Allied Commander General Gamelin expressed deep satisfaction with the battle results. The main objective of the French army at present is to occupy the remaining sections of the Saar River's banks. The German forces in the area have been forced to retreat, and therefore, the German army has lost control of this rich mining area. (United Press, 17th)</p>
<p>London: France has not only repelled the German counterattack surrounding Saarbrücken, but has also secured advances at several locations. This situation has greatly pleased the British and French people, as this was the first time the German army used its full strength to save Saarbrücken. The loss of this city would have a significant psychological impact on Germany and the world. Currently, the French line extends from the Luxembourg border to a point several miles east of Saarbrücken, a distance of about forty miles. The German forces are fighting hard to prevent the French from occupying the high ground between the Nied and Saar Rivers. French artillery fire from this location could control the industrial city of Saarbrücken, and the main fortifications of the Siegfried Line would also be within its range. So far, the French army has only used its advance units. Meanwhile, residents of Aachen, Germany, have reportedly been ordered to evacuate. It is said that only the elderly and disabled are allowed to use trains and cars. The rest, including children over twelve and women without children, must walk. The journey to Cologne takes three days. Everyone must bring their own food, and luggage is limited to thirty pounds. All other property will be abandoned. The residents have also been warned that if they attempt to flee into Belgium or the Netherlands, all their property will be confiscated. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris: Today's communiqué stated that both sides' artillery was very active, and the armies of both sides had frequent contact. The enemy is constantly transferring reinforcements to the front lines. The enemy destroyed villages in several places as they retreated. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: A semi-official report reviewing the war situation issued today stated that the attacking and defending armies on the Siegfried Line were engaged in close combat, fighting over the forward positions of the German defense line on the south bank of the Saar River. The German army launched a large-scale counterattack today on the rugged high ground between the Nied River and the Warndt Forest, controlling Saarlouis. Therefore, subsequent battle reports will focus on the important battles around the central Saar region. Fighting is currently taking place on the right bank of the lower Nied River, which winds through Porcelette before abruptly turning into sparsely wooded high ground. The eastern edge of this high ground controls the Saar River basin, its terrain resembling a balcony. French artillery can use this high ground to fire down on Saarlouis, the entire Saar River basin, and the high ground across the Saar River, where the real Siegfried Line is located. Therefore, the German army is determined to stop the French advance on this route and has sent a large army to counterattack, but without success. (Agence France-Presse, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: General Headquarters has just released bulletin number twenty-seven, stating: "Last night, the enemy launched offensives in two locations: one east of the Moselle River basin and one in the central part of the front line, between the Saar region and the French Vosges Mountains. Both were repelled by our forces. It has been confirmed that part of the German land and air forces have been transferred from the Eastern Front to the Western Front in recent days." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris: General Headquarters has just released bulletin number twenty-six, stating: "Yesterday, both sides' artillery was very active. Our advance units launched fierce attacks along the entire front line. The enemy continuously reinforced and stubbornly resisted. In several locations, the enemy destroyed many villages and towns as they retreated." (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>Chongqing: Chairman Chiang's opening remarks at the Fourth National Political Council Meeting, original text as follows: Vice-Chairman Zhang, fellow council members, since the adjournment of the Third National Political Council Meeting, the work of resisting the war and building the nation has indeed made great progress in the past six months. Moreover, the rapid changes in the international situation have provided extraordinary developments for our efforts to resist the war and build the nation. Today, we are holding the Fourth National Political Council Meeting, coinciding with the outbreak of the European war. What concerns you all the most is, of course, how to adapt to this new situation and implement our national policy of resisting the war. I would like to briefly state a few key points that we should focus on during this meeting. I believe that after the outbreak of the European war, we can further strengthen the spirit of national struggle for the work of resisting the war and building the nation. We must have confidence that China's victory in the war will make a greater contribution to this great era and new world in the future. At the same time, we must recognize that at this critical juncture, we must be extra cautious, extra effort to grasp the key points, lay the foundation, and concentrate our strength, so that no time or energy is wasted, and everything implemented by the country in the war can catch up and match the ultimate goal of victory. Therefore, I believe that the most essential things at present are: (1) concentrating talent to build the rear, (2) strengthening military affairs to strive for victory, and (3) paying attention to the international situation to promote wartime diplomacy.</p>
<p>Concentrating Talent to Build the Rear</p>
<p>From the first point of concentrating talent to build the rear, in order to achieve the goal of resisting the war, we must consolidate our base areas for resisting the war, and we must complete the construction of various economic, industrial, political, and cultural aspects in the rear, especially local autonomy, in order to strengthen our own resistance to the war and build a sound foundation for our nation. No matter how rapid the international changes and the evolution of the times, this is our only fundamental problem. No matter what the situation, we in China firmly believe that we can implement the national policy of resisting the war, shatter the enemy's ambitions of aggression, and achieve final victory, but the only key requirement is to quickly strengthen our national strength through self-reliance. When it comes to rear area construction, of course, every province is equally important, but everything should have a focus. The areas where we begin construction should be in the Northwest and Southwest provinces, and Sichuan and Kang are the central areas of the Northwest and Southwest and are even more important. At the last meeting, we decided to establish the Sichuan-Kang Construction Promotion Association and also organize the Sichuan-Kang Construction Inspection Group. In the past few months, fellow council members have not hesitated to endure the summer heat or the arduous journeys.</p>
<p>They have traveled all over Sichuan and Kang, inspecting and publicizing, providing great encouragement to local governments and the people. At the same time, they have collected a lot of very practical and rich materials. How to use this valuable harvest to promote our rear area construction is a topic that this conference will pay special attention to. Everyone should contribute as much as possible, and I believe that the government will fully adopt it. Speaking of construction, first of all, there must be appropriate talents. Our Political Council is the general mechanism for gathering the best and brightest talents from all over the country. With you, the council members, as the center, we will surely be able to gather the talents of the whole country to promote all construction. At present, it is truly a critical moment for China to fight for survival and decide life and death. All of us Chinese, with one point of strength, must contribute to the country. I hope that you will not only make good resolutions during the meeting, but also, after the meeting, do your best to mobilize the people, respond in unison, recommend the virtuous and capable, and assist the government in completing all the necessary construction for resisting the war and building the nation. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Strengthening Military Affairs to Strive for Victory</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding strengthening military affairs, there will be a detailed report on the military developments since the adjournment of the last meeting. Now, to put it simply, in the past six months, apart from our retreat from the Nanchang position, the enemy has not only gained nothing, but has also suffered great blows continuously. The enemy has not only made no progress, but has also retreated compared to six months ago. For example, in Shanxi, the enemy used eight divisions to attack our Taihang Mountains and Zhongtiao Mountains one after another, but since Jincheng was recaptured by our army, his plan was completely shattered. In northern Hubei, he attempted to attack our Nanyang and Xiangfan, wanting to eliminate the troops of our Fifth War Zone, but as a result, he was reduced by our army and could only retreat to the railway line from Xinyang to Hankou, not daring to take another step. South of the Yangtze River, the enemy originally wanted to take Changsha directly from Nanchang, but not only could he not advance, but Gao'an, the most important town, was also recaptured by our army. In other places, such as Conghua, Xinhui, and Chaozhou in Guangdong, he also repeatedly gained and lost, consuming extremely large forces. In short, whether it is in the northern battlefield, the eastern battlefield, or the southern battlefield, it proves that the enemy's forces are becoming more and more stretched. It can be said that since our retreat from Hankou, our military has become more stable. I predicted to the people last year that our future battlefields for a protracted war would be in the areas west of the Pinghan and Yuehan railway lines, and there is even more confidence in victory. In the past six months, this has been proven by facts. Today, I can realistically report to this meeting that our military strength has not only recovered to the level before the war, but has also increased by more than double compared to the time of the war.</p>
<p>As for military supplies, full preparations have long been made. However, this does not mean that we have no more concerns about the war of resistance in the future, or that there are no shortcomings, and even less can we assume that there will be no difficulties in the future. On the contrary, in order to break the enemy's final struggle, our future environment for resisting the war will inevitably encounter more difficulties and dangers. Therefore, in order to carry out our army's favorable counter-offensive and achieve final victory, we must not lose time, strengthen our military, political, and economic strength as much as possible. We must also intensify training, intensify replenishment, intensify efforts, and make conscription successful in various places, make close contact between the military and civilians, and develop local autonomy. Regarding these issues, you, the council members, come from all over the country and have more insight. I hope that you will put forward your opinions and reports as much as possible during the meeting, and I hope that after the meeting, you will work hard to promote matters such as the organization of strong men, local autonomy, and troop training, and assist as much as possible. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Diplomacy to Adapt to the New Situation</p>
<p>Finally, I want to talk about diplomacy, which means how we will adapt to this new situation after the outbreak of the European war in order to implement our national policy of resisting the war. This issue is of the utmost importance and requires particularly careful study. We all know that the Sino-Japanese War is a world problem, and it is the biggest problem in the world. It must be known that the current war in the world is entirely caused by Japan's invasion of China, destroying international public law, and disturbing the violent behavior of world peace. Our China's resistance to the war, on the one hand, is to protect the independence and survival of our country.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is actually to sanction Japan, the main culprit of this world war of aggression, and to safeguard world justice and peace. Because if the Sino-Japanese War is not over for a day, world peace can never be restored. In short, the Sino-Japanese War is the starting point of the world war and the center of the world war. This is what you should pay special attention to. What's more, we China is a country with a quarter of the world's population, and of course, we have a major obligation and responsibility to lay the foundation for a permanent world peace order. Since the September 18th Incident, our consistent national policy has been based on the following principles: (1) resisting Japanese aggression to protect our country's sovereignty and territorial administrative integrity, (2) abiding by international public law, especially the League of Nations, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the Non-War Treaty, to jointly safeguard the world order with countries that love justice and peace, (3) refusing to participate in the Anti-Comintern Pact, (4) diplomacy in self-reliance and autonomy, completely based on our own country's position and the interests of the war of resistance as a prerequisite, without being subject to any restrictions, in order to obtain China's freedom and equality, implement the Three People's Principles, and re-establish a permanent world peace. For eight years, the National Government has been fighting for this and has never changed. Now that the European war has begun, we must consolidate the established policy, regardless of the dangers and benefits of the future, and regardless of the extent to which the international situation changes, and we must seek to carry out our consistent policy to the end. After the outbreak of the European war, the enemy's expression is not to interfere in the European war, claiming to focus on solving the "Sino-Japanese War". What he calls not interfering in the European war, in other words, is not to allow Europe and the United States to interfere in the Sino-Japanese War, allowing him to dominate East Asia and establish his so-called "New East Asian Order". This is what I usually say, the enemy wants to create another world outside the present world. Isn't this to make him create a country name outside the Japanese world so that it no longer exists in the present world? Unless there is no Japanese country name in the world in the future, neither East Asia, China, or Japan can get rid of the present world and international relations and exist in isolation. However, the enemy is still talking about these New East Asian Order dreams. It is even more obvious that the enemy's mentality of taking advantage of the fire is particularly obvious. However, we in China have long decided on the national policy, and our position has always been consistent. We have long planned for the most difficult situation. Whether in the past, present, or future, we have never had the slightest fluke mentality. If the enemy wants to concentrate all his efforts to resolve the Sino-Japanese War, we can concentrate all our efforts to eliminate the enemy's ambitions and crush them without any residue. In fact, it is a fool's dream for the enemy to say "end the Sino-Japanese War quickly" to this day. He did not think that two years ago, he concentrated all his efforts to invade China, but he could not achieve the purpose of a quick victory, and waiting for today when his strength has become the end of a strong crossbow, he still wants to say these crazy words. This is asking the Japanese themselves, I am afraid they can't believe it either. The enemy's troops are already exhausted, and the internal situation is even more empty. If we talk about the military, the enemy has already failed and has fallen into a hopeless situation. In the future, in addition to the military, he will naturally intensify his so-called political offensive and economic offensive. In the future, we only need to concentrate on implementing our preparations for building the nation, strengthening our own resistance to the war, and laying the foundation for our victory from all aspects. This is our only fundamental problem at present. Fellow council members should also know that the present is the most important key to our country's safety and security. The international situation is changing rapidly. Our decisions today are really about the success or failure of the war of resistance, and even the misfortune and happiness of the nation for generations. If the policy we set is correct and without error, not only is military victory more assured, but also the established goal of the war of resistance must be achieved more quickly. Therefore, I sincerely hope that the members of this meeting will be more cautious in discussing and making decisions, and will not be tired of seeking details. Everything must be based on our fundamental national policy, and from the true right and wrong and the interests of the country for a hundred years, contribute effective strategies to determine the path for future efforts. The meeting period of this meeting is only ten days, and the time limit is very short. I think the most important thing is the few urgent matters mentioned above. I hope that everyone will focus their energy and time to fully discuss and strive for complete results. This is what the speaker earnestly hopes for the conference. (Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<h3>Terauchi Invited to Berlin; Germany and Japan Still Planning Collusion; Speculation on Observing the War During Stay in Germany; Liaison with President of Japan-Germany Association</h3>
<p>Berlin: General Terauchi of Japan, at the invitation of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, has arrived in Germany from Italy and is scheduled to arrive in Berlin on the evening of the 16th for a several-day stay, and to attend a welcome reception held by the German Foreign Minister. There is speculation that General Terauchi will visit a certain front line to observe the war during his stay in Germany, but this has not been confirmed. (Domei News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Rome: General Foerster, former commander of the German Baltic Fleet and president of the Japanese-German Association, arrived here today. It is reported that this trip has a special mission. According to well-informed sources, General Foerster is a well-known expert on Far Eastern issues. At a time when the Japanese military inspection group, led by former Minister of the Army General Terauchi and former Minister of the Navy General Osumi, is here, there is no doubt that Foerster's arrival is related to them. In addition, General Terauchi's group originally planned to return home via London and New York from Italy, but suddenly changed their plan and turned to Berlin at the invitation of the German authorities tonight, preparing to go to the Polish front to observe the war, which shows that General Foerster's arrival will meet with members of the Japanese military inspection group.

<h3>Japanese and Soviet Military Representatives Meet on the Front Line to Prepare for Concrete Negotiations</h3>
<p>Nomonhan Heights: Based on the local negotiations of the Nomonhan Armistice Agreement, the preliminary negotiations were opened at 4:30 p.m. on the 16th by the meeting of military envoys from both Japan and the Soviet Union. On the morning of that day, after receiving a report from the upper echelons that an armistice agreement had been established, a certain unit of the Japanese army immediately ordered the entire army to stop fighting. Therefore, the battlefield of the past once again presented a quiet scene yesterday. At 3:30 p.m., the headquarters dispatched Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka and Major Irimura as military envoys to the front line to meet with two Soviet military envoys and officers. Lieutenant Colonel Tanaka first asked, "It is gratifying to see the dawn of armistice and peace. Is your country implementing the armistice?" The Soviet military envoy immediately replied respectfully, "We expect to end the fighting at 8:00 a.m. on the 16th." At this point, the armistice between the Japanese and Soviet armies was confirmed. Next, Military Envoy Tanaka asked, "Have you prepared for concrete local negotiations?" The Soviet military envoy replied, "We have not yet received orders from the central government regarding local negotiations. We will reply after the order arrives." The Soviet side also scheduled a second meeting of military envoys at 5:00 p.m. on the 17th to reply to the Japanese side. (Domei News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Danzig: The German Foreign Office News reported that the adjustment of the disputes on the Manchurian-Mongolian border by diplomatic means has a meaning far beyond the local structure. The eagerness of the Soviet and Japanese countries to resolve the source of their conflicts is indeed a good starting point for the psychological solution of other events. A more friendly understanding between the two major powers in East Asia will certainly facilitate the peaceful resolution of fundamental problems in the Far East. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: German newspapers welcomed the establishment of the Soviet-Japanese armistice agreement, pointing out that this was something that the British were not happy to hear. The Hamburger Fremdenblatt stated that this armistice agreement created the basis for the exchange of interests between neighboring countries, which was the first step towards resolving other disputes. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The semi-official organization "German Foreign Political Correspondence" enthusiastically praised the resolution of the Soviet-Japanese war, believing that the solution of this problem through diplomatic channels was not only of local importance, but also that the desire of the Soviet and Japanese countries to eliminate the causes of the dispute was an advantageous psychological starting point for solving other difficulties. There is a tendency all over the world to eliminate various factors of disputes and unhealthy situations. The understanding between the two major powers in the Far East is conducive to the peaceful resolution of various fundamental problems. (Haitong News Agency, 17th)</p>
<p>Milan: Regarding the news of the conclusion of an agreement between the Soviet Union and Japan, Italian newspapers all published it with large headlines, believing that this agreement has great political significance. If the Soviet and Japanese countries achieve a general understanding, the international situation will be completely changed. It is said that the Moscow government has now authorized the new ambassador to Japan, Smetanin, to conduct direct negotiations with Tokyo to resolve all outstanding issues between the Soviet Union and Japan, including the Sakhalin Island issue. (Haitong Electric, 17th)</p>
<p>Rome: Regarding the establishment of an armistice agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union on the "Manchurian"-Mongolian border, Italian people did not consider it unexpected after hearing about it. Although the Japanese people here all kept silent, it is almost certain that the relationship between Japan and the Soviet Union will ease as a result. It is said in political circles that this armistice agreement has a realistic nature, but Japan's current foreign policy may not change at present. In other words, once the country establishes normal relations with the Soviet Union, it will still attempt to achieve its original goals in the Far East. (Agence France-Presse, 16th)</p>
<p>Paris: The famous reporter Béhautina recently commented on the armistice agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union on the Manchurian-Mongolian border in the moderate newspaper "L'Ordre," saying, "Before we receive detailed information, we believe that Japan's conclusion of this agreement is more than sufficient compared to the Soviet Union. The Red Army in the Soviet Far East has already formed an independent force, capable of maintaining the stability of Outer Mongolia. The conflict on the "Manchurian"-Mongolian border has not had much impact on the Soviet Union's headquarters. In addition, Japan's war against China has not been able to threaten the Soviet Union for more than a day. The Soviet authorities must be pleased with this, so why should they establish an armistice agreement with Japan? As for the current situation, Japan has made demands on the Shanghai concessions due to the outbreak of the European war, and "demands that Britain and France accept friendly advice" and withdraw the army and navy stationed in China, but it cannot but be careful to avoid intervention by the United States. Therefore, the key to this issue should still be sought in Washington." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>London: According to news from Peiping, before Japan and the Soviet Union signed the armistice agreement on the Manchurian-Mongolian border, they attached great importance to the border situation. According to foreigners who witnessed it outside Shanhaiguan, there were as many as thirteen Japanese military trains entering the three northeastern provinces from North China in one day, carrying an estimated 10,000 Japanese soldiers, all withdrawn from southern Shanxi. The number of Japanese bombers flying north was also large, indicating that the Japanese Air Force was also transferred from North China to increase the border defense force. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Changchun: Responsible persons here have denied the speculation that the Soviet Union, Japan, and "Manchukuo" will conclude other agreements following the armistice agreement. The general public here believes that this armistice agreement is limited to the Nomonhan Incident and is unlikely to lead to a broader reconciliation. It is credible that this is due to the strict attention of the Kwantung Army. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspapers Downplay the Soviet-Japanese Agreement</h3>
<p>Chongqing – This morning, all Chinese newspapers here carried news of the Soviet-Japanese armistice agreement, but none offered criticism and all placed it in relatively unimportant positions. Chinese people generally suspect that this agreement has purposes beyond resolving local accidental events. It is clear that the reason why the Chinese newspapers published this news in less important positions was to avoid alarming the Chinese people. According to the Saodang Bao, Wang Aisheng, the former counselor to the Japanese embassy and a well-known expert on Japanese affairs, expressed the opinion that a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression pact would never materialize. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Chongqing – Local newspapers here believe that the signing of the Nomonhan armistice agreement between Japan and the Soviet Union shows that Japanese diplomatic policy, under the control of the Abe cabinet, has reached a point of disregarding face. The Dagong Bao and Xinmin Bao both used large characters in their headlines saying, “Japan Yields Again.” The Xinmin Bao editorial stated that Japan's actions in concluding an armistice with the Soviet Union while simultaneously expressing willingness to negotiate new trade agreements with the United States is an internal expression of not caring about face. One year ago, Japan yielded due to the Zhanggufeng Incident. One year later, Japan has yielded again due to the Nomonhan Incident. However, when a better opportunity arises, Japan will inevitably attack the Soviet Union again. Furthermore, since Japan was abandoned by Hitler and unable to restore friendship with England, it will inevitably seek another way out. What should be noted now is that wise American politicians should not be fooled by it. The Saodang Bao published an article by Mr. Wang, a Japanese affairs expert and former Chinese envoy to Japan, discussing the possibility of Japan and the Soviet Union concluding a non-aggression treaty. According to Mr. Wang, from the Soviet perspective, Japan’s strength has been largely exhausted in China, leaving it unable to attack the Soviet Union, so there is no need to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan. Secondly, if the Soviet Union were to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Japan, it would only delay the outbreak of revolution in Japan, while suppressing Chinese resistance and prolonging the life of reactionary Japanese rule. For the Soviet Union to take such a step would be akin to saving the life of a rabid dog on its deathbed, thereby leaving trouble for itself. Thirdly, the Soviet Union, as a member of the League of Nations, has a duty to assist China and avoid weakening China's resistance. Moreover, since the Soviet Union has historically adopted a policy of assisting China, it would not deviate from this path midway and reverse its previous actions. Fourthly, if Japan were to seek a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, it would place itself in a self-contradictory position. Anti-communism and anti-Sovietism are the central tenets of modern Japan, and the Japanese army’s continental policy is entirely driven by anti-communist and anti-Soviet ideology. Finally, Mr. Wang believes that if a Soviet-Japanese non-aggression treaty is concluded, it would naturally be extremely detrimental to China. (Associated Press, 17th)</p>
<h3>Flourishing Sino-Soviet Trade</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Since the Sino-Soviet trade agreement was established in June, trade between China and the Soviet Union via Xinjiang has greatly flourished. China’s exports to the Soviet Union are mostly tung oil, sheepskin, cowhide, and tea. The import of Soviet goods is also substantial, but the exact figures are not yet available. In addition, the Chinese side is constantly improving the highways in the Northwest and Xinjiang to promote Sino-Soviet transportation. (Associated Press, 17th)</p>
<h3>Madame Chiang Kai-shek Initiates Winter Clothing Drive</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Madame Chiang Kai-shek, a standing committee member of the Chinese Women’s Comforting Association for Soldiers Fighting in Self-Defense Against the War of Resistance, has instructed the association to actively coordinate the national women's winter clothing drive, which is now ready. Madame Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the wives of provincial chairmen, local women's work committees, comfort branches, and various women's organizations, ordering overseas Chinese to launch a campaign to raise 500,000 pieces of cotton clothing. It is reported that women in various places have already responded. (17th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Commemorates “September 18th”</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Tomorrow is the anniversary of the September 18th Incident. The people of Chongqing will all observe a day of vegetarianism and use their savings to purchase winter clothing for the soldiers on the front lines. At noon, the entire city will observe three minutes of silence to mourn China's war dead. The city will hold mass rallies in four districts to raise funds for soldiers' winter uniforms, launch a campaign to eliminate traitors, and comfort wounded soldiers. Madame Chiang Kai-shek, Soong Mei-ling, will appeal to various women's organizations on the eve of September 18th to sew 500,000 pieces of winter clothing for the soldiers on the front lines.

Japanese soldiers in the city, hearing the alarm, gathered in a swarm and fired shots in a panic, counterattacking and wounding several puppet members. They also arrested many innocent citizens in various streets and alleys. Unexpectedly, a Chinese plainclothes team attacked the camp at the former administrative office in Shahe in the eastern suburbs, and gunfire erupted, causing chaos throughout the city. Residents were uneasy all night. The Chinese plainclothes team left peacefully only at dawn. (17th)</p>

<h3>Germany Declares Reservation of Rights Regarding Methods of Warfare; Responds to British and French Governments</h3>
<p>Berlin – The German News Agency recently issued a message stating that the British and French governments issued a joint declaration on the 12th of this month outlining methods of warfare and notified the German government, requesting a response. The German government has now submitted a response, which was conveyed to Britain and France through the Swedish government. The message states that since the failure of the disarmament conference, the German government has been the first to advocate for the humanization of warfare as much as possible. Until recently, Fuehrer Hitler again gave a speech in the Reichstag, declaring that he did not want to harm women and children, and that air force bombing should be limited to military targets. At the same time, the German government has given a positive answer to the application made by US President Roosevelt (President Roosevelt applied to the governments of England, France, Germany, and Poland not to bomb civilians) and notified the British government that it is willing to abide by the provisions of the 1925 Geneva Protocol and avoid the use of poison gas. The German military has always strictly adhered to these points when fighting, but only on the condition that the enemy also abides by them. Unfortunately, the enemy countries have repeatedly violated the guarantees they have made. For example, the British government violated naval warfare regulations, issued lists of prohibited goods, and imposed a blockade on German women and children. The Polish government turned undefended cities into military bases, organized civilians into plainclothes units, and used poison gas. All of these are well-documented. Therefore, although the German army continues to adhere to the principle of humanization in warfare, the German government must still reserve the right to respond to the enemy's violations of international law. The blockade that subjects women and children to hunger will also be met with the weapons it possesses (referring to submarine warfare). It should be known that this method is self-inflicted by the enemy, and its impact will be terrible. Don't say you weren't warned.” (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Turkish Foreign Minister Departs for Moscow</h3>
<p>Istanbul – Turkish Foreign Minister Saracoğlu will depart for Moscow tonight. According to well-informed sources here, Saracoğlu’s trip is not only to sign a Soviet-Turkish non-aggression pact, but also to lay the foundation for a German-Turkish non-aggression pact. People here are paying close attention to the news of the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops to Poland. This afternoon, the radio station broadcast the news. Within minutes, newspapers had printed extra editions, rushing to report on the Soviet Union's dispatch of troops. Pro-British and pro-French people felt shocked and displeased upon hearing the news.

<h3>Number of People Mobilized in French Territories Equals That During the Great War</h3>
<p>Paris – According to the Ministry of Colonies, the number of people mobilized in French territories is now equal to the total number of soldiers recruited during the World War, and will soon exceed it. In terms of economics, French territories will have more food in the coming months than they did between 1914 and 1918. The Ministry of Colonies has instructed the governors of all colonies to supply 3.5 million tons of food from the existing harvest, including 1.6 million tons of grain, most of which is produced in Vietnam. This shows the abundance of food. The Ministry of Colonies has ordered the French African territories to supply 800,000 tons of various foods, as well as 1.1 million tons of oil products. In addition, the colonies are also ordered to supply 800,000 tons of industrial raw materials, including 300,000 tons of wood, 350,000 tons of coal and various ores, 60,000 tons of rubber, and 40,000 tons of textiles.

<h3>Germany Warns Countries of the Oslo Convention: "If They Yield to British Threats, Germany Will Impose the Same Pressure"</h3>
<p>Swiss Capital – The semi-official German agency "German News Report" published an article yesterday entitled "Warning to the Foreign Ministers of the Countries of the Oslo Convention," which was distributed by the German News Agency. The main point was to threaten the neutral countries and advise them not to give in to Britain. It said that the British government recently sent a note to the neutral countries, requesting three things: (1) to prohibit the shipment of war materials owned by these countries to Germany; (2) to prohibit the shipment of other goods that could replace these raw materials to Germany; (3) to prohibit the transit of foreign goods to Germany. All of these actions by the British government are a clear violation of neutrality regulations and are intended to harm Germany. However, Germany is not without the ability to defend itself in the regions where Britain is exerting threats, and knows how to protect its own rights no less than Britain. Since Britain is using illegal means to oppress the neutral countries, if the neutral countries willingly yield, then Germany must apply the same pressure to them. As the foreign ministers of the Oslo Convention countries are meeting in the Danish capital on the 18th of this month, we hereby warn them to avoid succumbing to British threats and suppressing Germany's wishes. It is certainly Germany's wish to allow the neutral countries to avoid getting caught up in the vortex as much as possible, but the world must not view this as a sign of German weakness, nor should it think that Germany can tolerate the neutral countries violating neutrality. It should be known that even if these countries are forced to do so, Germany will never stand idly by. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Comparison of French and German Defense Lines</h3>
<p>Paris – Semi-official sources have recently explained the differences between the French Maginot Line and the German Siegfried Line, stating that the Maginot Line was created through many years of painstaking effort, while the Siegfried Line was completed in just two years. The fortresses of the Maginot Line are mostly very large artillery forts, while the only large artillery fort in the Siegfried Line is in the Saarbrücken area. The rest are mostly small artillery positions, machine gun positions, traps, mines, and tank defense lines. Germany has been lacking metal products for many years, and this situation is evident in the Siegfried Line. For example, the tank defense lines should use large steel bars, but the Siegfried Line uses reinforced concrete pillars. As far as the current war situation is concerned, since the French army adopted an offensive between the Rhine and Moselle rivers, it has advanced twenty kilometers along the entire line. Conversely, French territory has not been invaded by enemy troops. However, due to the success of the German army in the eastern theater, it is now transferring troops to the western front, and it is expected that it will take action in the west in the near future.

<h3>Account of German-Dutch Plane Clash Released by Dutch Side</h3>
<p>Dutch Capital – A Dutch plane was attacked by a German plane over the island of Ameland (belonging to the Netherlands) on the 13th of this month. The Dutch News Agency has recently recounted the circumstances. It is said that on that day, a Dutch plane saw a foreign plane and took off to track it, intending to find out its nationality. After determining its nationality, it turned back. Unexpectedly, the German plane suddenly attacked with machine guns from a distance of 50 meters. The Dutch plane was forced to land, and the German plane followed suit. The German pilot stood on the wing and pointed a pistol, asking the Dutch pilot if it was a British plane in disguise. After receiving a satisfactory answer, he took the injured Dutch pilots to Nortney, Germany, for medical treatment. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Germany Gives Elaborate Funeral to French Air Force Officer</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken – Lieutenant Rossner of the 2nd Squadron of French reconnaissance aircraft was shot down by the German army while flying over Germany on a reconnaissance mission yesterday and died immediately. The German authorities buried him in the Saarbrücken cemetery yesterday. The ceremony was very grand. An army chaplain gave a short speech, emphasizing that "the German army has always treated chivalrous enemies with a chivalrous spirit. The two French air force officers fought bravely and deserve our respect." (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<h3>Explosion in Central Berlin</h3>
<p>Dutch Capital – The Electric News reports, according to news from the Danish capital, that there was a huge explosion in central Berlin at 8 p.m. yesterday. The glass windows of that department and the major department stores on Leipzig Street were shattered, and many pedestrians were injured. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Prominent Figures Debate Fiercely on the Question of the United States Abolishing the Arms Embargo</h3>
<p>Washington – On Friday, Colonel Lindbergh gave a radio broadcast speech advocating that the United States stay out of the European war. Today, various circles are debating more about how the United States can avoid getting caught up in the European war vortex. Former Secretary of State Stimson and Columbia University President Dr. Butler wrote to the New York "Times," advocating the abolition of the neutral law's arms embargo clause, saying that the clause is not neutral and puts the United States on the side of Germany. Stimson wrote, "The abolition of this clause may be the last hope for the United States to avoid getting caught up in the vortex." Butler wrote, "The neutral law makes us join the war on the side of the aggressors. Abolishing the neutral law and returning to the neutrality stipulated by international law and the contract will allow our country to stand on a solid footing." (Associated Press, 17th)</p>
<p>Washington – Republican Senator Vandenberg, who is expected to be a candidate in the 1940 election, gave a radio broadcast speech here, opposing the repeal of the arms embargo clause and strongly criticizing President Roosevelt's current policies, saying, "Revising our current neutral law to benefit a certain belligerent country is a clear violation of neutrality, no matter how sympathetic we are to that belligerent country. This approach can be said to be trying to avoid getting caught up in the war vortex on the one hand, and trying to participate in the war to half the extent on the other. I do not believe that this position can be sustained, and I do not believe that the United States can be a munitions factory for a certain belligerent country without becoming a target for other belligerent countries. Therefore, I advocate maintaining the current neutral law so that we can be completely neutral. Unless our sovereignty is directly attacked, our country should always maintain neutrality. For the sake of our country's peace and for the sake of the world, it is beneficial to have a strong country issue a call for peace in this turbulent international situation. In short, until we are determined to prepare to go to war, no matter which side we sympathize with, it is best to stay out of it." As for the government's current policies, the authorities are trying to test various socialist reform plans, but the result is only to poison the original system of the United States, shorten the financial budget, and fail the economic recovery efforts. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<h3>Italy Strives for Economic Self-Sufficiency</h3>
<p>Rome – The "Italian News" published an article today commenting on the Italian cabinet meeting yesterday to discuss the issue of raw materials and food, emphasizing that Italy must redouble its efforts to achieve its economic self-sufficiency plan. The report pointed out that Italy is currently the only industrial country in Europe that has not been caught up in the European war, and its industry should not only fully meet the needs of its own country, but should also take advantage of the opportunity to seek development in other markets. The purpose of the self-sufficiency policy is nothing more than two points: one is to limit consumption, and the other is to massively develop agricultural and mineral industries. The results are the following two points: (1) Food supply can be guaranteed; (2) Increase domestic coal production and develop Albania's oil reserves; (3) Limit the consumption of metals. Albania produces a lot of iron, and the production of aluminum, zinc, and lead is already sufficient for domestic use. Copper, nickel, and tin are in great demand, but they can only be replaced by other minerals; (4) Silk products are already self-sufficient; (5) Artificial rubber has also begun production; (6) The machinery and chemical industries have good sales at home and abroad. (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<h3>Regular Resumption of Dutch-Belgian Civil Aviation</h3>
<p>Brussels – It was announced here today that civil aviation between Belgium and the Netherlands is scheduled to resume on the 20th of this month. There will be two flights a day in each direction, that is, Brussels will fly two flights at 10:30 am and 6:15 pm every day, and Amsterdam will fly two flights at 8:00 am and 3:45 pm every day. This business is jointly operated by the Belgian and Dutch airlines. (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<h3>Germany Denies Arresting Clergy</h3>
<p>Berlin – The official German news agency admitted that many people were arrested in Bohemia and Moravia in the Czech Republic, saying that most of those arrested were followers of former Czech President Beneš and Jews, and there were also some clergy, but this cannot be said to be a systematic mass arrest of Catholics. It should be known that the arrests were entirely for political reasons. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>Envoys from Various Countries to Poland Reside in Romania</h3>
<p>Romanian Capital – Since the diplomatic representatives of various countries to Poland took refuge in the town of Cernăuți in Romania, they still enter and leave Poland every day to maintain diplomatic contact with the country's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. (Haitong, 17th)</p>
<h3>Rumors of German Giant Liner "Bremen" Reaching Soviet Port</h3>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland – There were rumors that the German liner "Bremen" had been captured by British warships, but this was denied by the German side. It has recently been heard that the "Bremen" is now anchored in the Soviet northern port of Murmansk, but this news has not been confirmed. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Milan – According to the Stanpa reporter in Narvik, Norway, the German ship "Bremen" did escape the pursuit of British warships and arrived at the Soviet port of Murmansk in the northern Atlantic. According to the ship's crew, who spoke to the reporter, the escape was described as follows: After being detained in New York for about 24 hours, the "Bremen" arrived in international waters at the beginning of the German-Polish war. The captain immediately called a meeting of the crew and read out the sealed instructions, which specified that in the event of war, the ship should go to a neutral port and anchor temporarily. As a result of studying the map, it was decided to detour north and disguise the ship's name to avoid passing through the usual routes in the Atlantic, so as not to be discovered by enemy warships. It sailed east across the northern Atlantic, through the Denmark Strait, and reached the Arctic Ocean. At that time, the ship received a radio report saying that the ship was on its way to Mexico. It was unknown that the "Bremen" was sailing safely in the icy waters. After twelve days, the "Bremen" finally saw the North Cape lighthouse. The Soviet authorities, seeing a ship arriving at the port of Murmansk, are reviewing various legal issues. All the ship's personnel are still living on board. (Haitong, 16th)</p>
<h3>Closure of the German Consulate in Hong Kong, Detention of German Nationals in Concentration Camps, and Confiscation of Remaining Property</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence, 3rd of this Month: Following Britain's declaration of war against Germany, the Hong Kong government immediately arrested German nationals that evening and sent them to concentration camps. The next day, in accordance with the Enemy Property Sequestration Ordinance, the Hong Kong government sealed up the property of German residents. The situation was quite tense, and the actions were very thorough. Currently, German merchant firms and stores have been sealed by the Hong Kong government. These include the well-known Melchers &amp; Co., agents for German steamships, the Agafa film company, Smith &amp; Schmeidt on Pedder Street, the German firm Schleiba in the Prince's Building, and two German firms located downstairs in the Gloucester Building, all of which have been sealed. One of these firms specialized in German cameras and photographic equipment, as well as microscopes. Before the outbreak of the European war, its inventory was worth over one million yuan. After the German invasion of Poland, a portion was shipped to Macau for storage. When Britain declared war on Germany, the news came suddenly, and several German merchants from the company hurriedly fled to Macau. The "Leica" cameras and microscopes that they did not have time to move were worth six to seven hundred thousand yuan. The company initially entrusted an English woman to look after it. However, after Britain declared war on Germany, the English woman submitted the warehouse keys to the police the next morning, and the authorities immediately sent personnel to seal the firm, take inventory of the goods in the warehouse, and assigned a Chinese detective to guard it. The Chinese employees and a Russian woman only received their September salaries. No fewer than five hundred Chinese people lost their jobs as a result of working for German firms in Hong Kong. Forty or fifty of them were members of the Hong Kong Chinese Clerks' Association. The association is currently trying to provide relief. The German Ocean News Agency stopped sending稿 (gao3 manuscript)at the beginning of the German-Polish war. Its manager first left Hong Kong for Macau, then suddenly returned to Hong Kong from Macau. However, when he arrived in Hong Kong, Britain had already declared war on Germany, and the Hong Kong authorities had ordered the detention of German nationals. The manager's whereabouts are unknown. The Hong Kong government authorities dispatched several detectives to seal up the German Consulate in Hong Kong on the seventh floor of Pedder Building. From dawn to noon, they were still counting various items. The consulate's Chinese staff had already been dismissed. According to news from foreigners, the authorities have sent export passports to the German Consul, Keble, and his assistant, Pingshou, and others.</p>
<p>The residences of German nationals in Hong Kong were all searched by the Hong Kong government, which dispatched many Chinese and English detectives separately, and were also sealed up. Currently, most German nationals have been arrested and first concentrated at the Central Police Station. After registration and other procedures, they were transported by police vehicles to the La Salle College concentration camp in Kowloon. German women and children were still ordered to reside at home. It is reported that there are one hundred German nationals. It is not reported how many are women and children, but German nationals in the concentration camp have a very free life. They read, exercise, chat and amuse themselves. It is heard that relevant parties are now planning to release a portion of the German nationals from the camp. The other day, Mr. Cooder, the Southern District Officer, Police Superintendent Sperrow, and the German consulate secretary, Killivetuza, discussed the parole method while inspecting the concentration camp. The scope of parole is limited to Austrian nationals and married German nationals. At present, a small number of people can meet this condition and will be reunited with their wives, but their actions must be restricted and monitored. Before the outbreak of the European war, German merchants in Hong Kong had a very large amount of deposits in banks. Many people did not have time to withdraw them due to the sudden onset of events. The Hong Kong authorities have sealed and confiscated them all in accordance with the Enemy Property Sequestration Ordinance. As for the goods consigned to German stores, the Hong Kong authorities can also regard them as German property and implement confiscation. However, all goods that have been traded clearly before the war are not subject to this restriction. It has also been found that in general Chinese, English, and other non-enemy joint ventures with Germans, the authorities, after liquidating the stores, will allocate the appropriate amount of profits due to the non-enemy shareholders in proportion to their investment. It is reported that the number of movable and immovable properties of German nationals that have been sealed and confiscated is very large. It is currently being handled by Mr. Antonulus, the Official Receiver of the government.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Punan Vent Frustration by Burning Down the Ding Residence</h3>
<p>Punan Correspondence: Punan and other places are the defense zone of the Ding Xisan troops of the Chinese army. The Japanese army had long regarded the Ding troops as a confidant's trouble. For two years, they repeatedly launched large-scale invasions, hoping to destroy them. However, due to the terrain, they were unable to win. Recently, the Ding troops and guerrillas in a certain place had disagreements and internal strife occurred. The Japanese side took this opportunity to heavily press on the border. However, each team is of a mobile nature, coming and going. It is extremely difficult for the Japanese army to deal with them. Unable to vent their anger, they dispatched a team on the fourteenth to surround and search Dingjia Village in Wujiaqiao. Because Ding was from this place, they set fire to Ding's old residence. This place was originally a Ding-surname village with more than one hundred households, all of which suffered from the fire. The extent of the loss is awaiting further report.</p>
<h3>Soaring Rice Prices in Wuxi</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: In the rice market in the county, in early August, each stone (dan) cost only thirteen or fourteen yuan. By August 12th and 13th, it soared by two or three yuan, exceeding the fifteen yuan mark. In the latter part of the month, it gradually rose, reaching seventeen or eighteen yuan per stone. In the early part of this month, it once rose to twenty yuan. Afterward, it fluctuated between eighteen and nineteen yuan. In the past three or four days, the market price has risen wildly again. On the 16th, each stone reached twenty-five yuan, which has never happened before. It is heard that the reason for the sudden rise is that the stock is limited, the source is scarce, and there is a shortage of white japonica rice. It is now the White Dew season, and there are still two months before the late rice harvest. The poor people cannot wait. The danger in the meantime is even greater than in the past.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Economic Impact of the European War on East Asia</h3>
<p>—Written by John Ahlers, Translated by Bo Ming</p>
<p>What is the Trend? With the outbreak of another major war in Europe, the countries of the Far East are all greatly affected; however, the impact is not uniform; and because it is too early, it is not possible to point out what the overall and final impact on the Far Eastern economy will be. The most pressing question for the people of Shanghai is what impact the war in the Old World will have on China, Japan, and the war between the two countries. This question cannot be answered accurately yet. However, some early trends in the new development are already discernible. In general, these trends are: imports are becoming more difficult, while export prospects are becoming stronger; however, the export side is also hindered by a shortage of shipping and rising insurance rates.</p>
<p>Imports of German Goods and China and Japan: Imports of German goods to China and Japan will inevitably be drastically reduced; perhaps there is even a possibility of complete disappearance. The British and French blockade of the German west coast prevents goods from being transported from German ports to the Far East; German shipping in the high seas has ceased. Although Germany has the possibility of exporting through Scandinavia, the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, and the Balkan countries, England and France will of course take opposing steps. It is easy for England and France to blockade the export of German goods through the above-mentioned small countries; if Italy is taken as a route and Italian and Japanese ships are used to transport the goods, this possibility still needs to be considered. In any case, the European war will make Germany's economy exhausted, but countries that rely on German imports will also have difficulties. This is especially true for machinery, metal products, iron, steel, and many medicines. Many of these goods imported by the Far East come from Germany. The cut-off of supplies from the German side will leave the Far East feeling greatly insufficient. Japan uses German machinery and other supplies for its industrialization plan in the three northeastern provinces. With the interruption of German supplies, these plans will be delayed from now on; Japan's wartime industry in its mainland will also have to reduce its expansion plans; because these plans are based on obtaining supplies from Germany.</p>
<p>Other Imports: Although England and France can maintain their maritime trade, most of the industry in England and France will manufacture weapons and other items for wartime consumption; many English and French goods that China and Japan usually import will no longer be transported, or at least not as many as before. Many neutral countries in Europe and the United States will find very profitable wartime new markets in the warring countries, so they will also neglect exports to the Far East; in particular, new orders for war materials from the European Union to the heavy industry in the United States will inevitably greatly hinder Japan. Because no less than two-thirds of Japan's military supplies from foreign countries come from the United States. The recent depreciation of the pound sterling by 15%; this new price is also another obstacle to imports in the Far East. The Japanese yen is closely pegged to the pound sterling and depreciates with it, and Japan's trade also suffers losses. Because most of Japan's imports come from countries that have not devalued their currencies, including the United States, Hawaii, and the Philippines, which account for 48% of Japan's imports from non-yen bloc countries. Japan now has to pay about 20% more in yen for these goods imported from the United States. In China, there have been drastic fluctuations in the exchange rate between foreign currencies and legal tender recently; China's imports from devalued countries and non-devalued countries are each half; but China will continue or increase imports from countries in the European Union, but they are cheaper than imports from countries that do not depreciate, but there are war obstacles.</p>
<p>Impact on Far Eastern Finance: The extremely urgent foreign exchange situation in China and Japan has been made more urgent by recent monetary developments. London's currency is no longer as cheap as it used to be; Japan's foreign trade, which uses pound sterling to settle payments, is more expensive than ever before; Japan's exchange banks, which pre-settle their domestic transactions based on London's discount rate of 2%, are now suffering heavy losses because the discount rate has risen by more than 3%. Hong Kong's implementation of foreign exchange control will also hinder China's financial relations with the outside world. Will Chinese financial institutions currently concentrated in Hong Kong be forced to move to Manila and be protected and facilitated by the United States through the United Kingdom? Let's wait and see!</p>
<p>Boom in Raw Material Markets: On the other hand, it is gratifying that the world is now in greater need of Far Eastern goods; at least some of the military supply industry in the United States has suddenly flourished, so the military supply business in countries east of the Suez Canal is also expected to flourish. Stock prices on the New York Stock Exchange have risen sharply by one-half or even almost doubled due to the European war. Prices in New York have also risen, and according to the US Secretary of Agriculture, this may be sustainable. Therefore, the US export subsidy for wheat has also been abolished.</p>
<p>The United States is the largest customer of most countries in the East, and their business conditions and economic development are closely linked to the extent of economic development in the United States; when the US economy is in a slump, the Eastern economy is also in a slump; when the US market is prosperous, the Far Eastern economy also recovers. The US business community has no fear that the implementation of neutrality laws will hinder the wholesale of military supplies to England and France.</p>
<p>The most profitable countries in need of Far Eastern raw materials from Europe and the United States will be the colonial countries such as British Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and French Vietnam. Thailand's rubber and tin will also benefit somewhat. China produces a variety of raw materials, the most needed by Europe and the United States are tungsten sand, antimony, tin, tung oil, silk, bristles, raw and tanned leather, and vegetable oil. At present, the currency exchange rate is low and prices are trending upward, which should promote the export of these products. However, it is difficult to transport more products and metals out of the country, except for the "free China" and the areas occupied by Japan that are currently trying to export them. The Japanese will use all coercive means in the Yangtze River basin to plunder all kinds of export goods in exchange for foreign exchange. However, North China has lost its status as an important export area this year due to floods and locust plagues.</p>
<p>Japan's Export Industry: However, Japan can only export one raw material suitable for military use, and that is silk. 20-denier raw silk is a raw material for making parachutes, balloons, and other war materials. Silk prices in Yokohama and Kobe have now soared to unprecedented highs of around 1,500 Japanese yen per bale. However, other military raw materials produced or manufactured in Japan are urgently needed by Japan itself when it continues its war in China, unless the war ends. Japan's wartime industry is now employing workers to the best of its ability to produce war materials that Japan itself needs; however, the continued expansion of Japan's wartime industry will be delayed due to new difficulties in imports to the Far East.</p>
<p>Japan's peaceful industries, especially the textile industry, have high export hopes for the European war, because it expects that these products from the warring countries will no longer be transported. It also hopes that some neutral countries will also reduce the transportation of these products to the Far East. Therefore, the Japanese textile industry wants to take the opportunity to monopolize the Far Eastern market and drastically expand its markets in Malaya, India, Africa, Australia, and even Latin America. The high domestic prices in Japan in recent years have caused its exports to suffer extremely serious damage in the past two years. Now that the world price level has generally increased due to the war, Japan's losses will be partially compensated; the competitiveness of the Japanese textile industry overseas has been greatly restored. However, the biggest obstacle to realizing these hopes is the lack of necessary foreign exchange, so it cannot purchase foreign raw materials such as raw cotton and pulp. Since the United Kingdom, the United States, or France have already experienced Japan's war to kill other countries after the First World War, Japan cannot expect these three countries to lend money to support its export industry again.</p>
<p>Far Eastern Shipping Industry: Among the wartime developments in Far Eastern trade, the shipping problem is the most serious. Many Far Eastern shipping services have at least been temporarily suspended or greatly reduced. Most of the merchant ships of the European warring countries must assist the navy, so they will reduce their shipping activities in the Far East; the German submarine war is underway, and the war insurance rate has greatly increased. Japan is the only country in the Far East with a large merchant fleet; however, about one-fifth of its merchant ships have also been requisitioned for use in transporting military supplies; in addition, three-fifths of the Japanese ships travel between Osaka, Yokohama, Kobe, and Dalian to relieve the congestion of their accumulated goods; therefore, only one-fifth of them can be used to sail the high seas. If it wants to build more ships, it will encounter difficulties in obtaining sufficient building materials; therefore, Japan cannot monopolize this part of the world's shipping in the near future.</p>
<p>Conclusion: From all the above situations, it seems that the outbreak of the European war has immediately added to the overall economic difficulties in the Far East; for China and Japan, the hope that East Asia will benefit from the European war seems to be in the more distant future; however, the two warring countries in East Asia are not willing to stop the war early due to their exhaustion. Although it will be difficult for China and Japan to import foreign war materials, both countries have accumulated a large amount of military supplies and can continue armed conflict on the current scale for a long time; and all of Japan's foreign military supplies will be cut off; but China can at least continue to obtain assistance from the Soviet Union. This situation has significantly reduced Japan's military advantage; and China's hope for final victory is even stronger.</p>
<h3>Shanghai's Import Trade After Customs Accepts "Huaxing Currency"</h3>
<p>—Wang Yousheng</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, Shanghai's import trade exceeded 136 million customs gold units, almost doubling compared to the same period last year. This sudden prosperity has caused a general sense of optimism among importers about the future. However, a closer analysis reveals that this prosperity in import trade is not a normal development. Because the interior is not peaceful, most wealthy people in the countryside regard Shanghai as a haven of refuge. This has led to an unprecedented surge in Shanghai's population and a concentration of large amounts of capital. The need for a large number of consumer goods has stimulated import trade. However, we see that these many refugees are by no means reliable customers. Most of them are consumers, not real producers. When their money is almost used up, they will naturally have to return to their hometowns. The prosperity of import trade cannot be maintained for long.</p>
<p>The recent sharp contraction of foreign exchange has increased the trend of decline in import trade. Since September 1, the customs has also announced that import duties must be paid in "Huaxing Currency." Because the exchange rate between "Huaxing Currency" and legal tender is set by the pseudo-supervisors at a price of 1.55 yuan of legal tender per yuan of "Huaxing Currency" (exchange rate on September 1), the customs import duty has invisibly increased by 55%. Although foreign exchange has recently slightly lengthened due to the European war, the exchange rate of "Huaxing Currency" is still above 1.3 yuan per yuan. In this way, the import trade, which was already in a precarious state, was hit by the two forces of foreign exchange and tariffs, and it will inevitably plummet.</p>
<p>However, the impact of "Huaxing Currency" on importers from various countries in Shanghai is not uniform. On the surface, it seems that British and American goods and Japanese goods are subject to the same proportional increase in taxes. In secret, Japanese goods enjoy special treatment. Because since September 1, the customs has also changed the method of converting foreign currencies for valuation. The Japanese side used the depreciation of the Japanese yen in the Shanghai market to force the customs to change the method of calculating the taxable value of imported Japanese goods, changing the Japanese currency to legal tender according to the market price in Shanghai, then changing the legal tender to gold pounds according to the black market foreign exchange rate, and then changing the British pound to the customs gold unit. In this way, the taxable value of Japanese goods is reduced to one-third of the price calculated before September 1. The tax that needs to be paid now, even if the 50% increase in tax from the conversion of "Huaxing Currency" is added, is still half less than before September 1. This method of the customs specifically favoring Japanese goods will undoubtedly cause a major change in the number of import trades of various countries at Shanghai Customs.</p>
<p>Therefore, the goal of the customs import tax being subject to "Huaxing Currency" is not only to increase tax revenue or promote pseudo-currency, but also to hide a conspiracy to squeeze British and American goods out of the Shanghai market behind it. It is not difficult to predict that Shanghai's import trade will be monopolized by Japanese merchants in the future.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The tax payment for Japanese goods was originally based on Yen 100 = 37.5 G.U. (i.e., the official price of Japanese yen Y.1: I.2d). Now it is changed to Y? = Ch. ? = f? = G.U. ? formula, so the number of gold pounds obtained by converting Japanese yen according to the Chinese black market price is of course much smaller; the number of customs gold units that can be combined is also reduced by two-thirds, because the black market Japanese yen is much smaller than the official price of Japanese yen.</p>
<h3>Prospects for the Japanese Shipping Industry in Wartime</h3>
<p>—Li Shumin</p>
<p>Japan is an island nation, and it is reasonable for its shipping industry to be particularly prosperous. Its total tonnage of merchant ships is 4 million tons (according to statistics in 1937). This is certainly not comparable to the United Kingdom and the United States (Japan's total tonnage of merchant ships is one-fifth of the United Kingdom's and one-quarter of the United States', ranking third among countries). However, it can be said to be second to none in Asia, unparalleled.</p>
<p>According to the companies operating in Japan, the largest ones are three: Nippon Yusen Kaisha, Osaka Shosen Kaisha, and Nisshin Kisen Kaisha. The former is the largest shipping company in Japan, with 180 merchant ships, totaling 880,000 tons (possibly increased in recent years). Osaka Shosen Kaisha is famous for transporting goods. The latter is known for operating the Yangtze River shipping industry in China. After our country's coastal cities along the Yangtze River fell, such as Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Wuhu, Changsha, Hankou, etc., the company's business became even more active. In recent years, Japan's trade deficit has relied on this profit to make up for it, which is not a small number.</p>
<p>As for its foreign trade activities, it is almost all over the world. The following is a brief description of the important routes of Nippon Yusen Kaisha:</p>
<p>(1) San Francisco Line, USA: From Hong Kong and Shanghai, via Yokohama, Japan, takes the southern route to Honolulu and then to San Francisco, USA. It sails once every two weeks, and the voyage from Shanghai to San Francisco takes 24 days.</p>
<p>(2) Seattle Line, USA: From Hong Kong and Shanghai, via Yokohama, Japan, sails north to Seattle, once every two weeks.</p>
<p>(3) Europe Line: From Japan, via Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, (Colombo) Aden, India, Suez, Marseille, to London, England. It takes 35 days from Shanghai to London.</p>
<p>(4) Australia Line: From Japan, via Shanghai, Hong Kong, the Philippines (Manila), to New Gold Mountain, Australia, sailing once a month.</p>
<p>(5) India-Bombay Line: From Japan, via Shanghai, Hong Kong, Singapore, Colombo to Bombay, once a month. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>How Should Industry and Commerce Strive?</h3>
<p>— Guan Zhuxin</p>
<p>Shanghai's industry and commerce, after becoming an isolated island, once experienced a period of special prosperity. However, this kind of prosperity has recently disappeared. Every industrial and commercial enterprise, after expanding its equipment, increasingly feels the pain of being too big to fail. The biggest issues are:</p>
<p>(1) Difficulty in Capital Turnover: During the period of special prosperity, due to rising prices and increased sales brought about by various special relationships, every factory had to expand its equipment in order to obtain large profits. To cite an example: a factory with 5,000 yuan enjoyed huge profits during the special prosperity period. At a certain point, all their funds were transformed into commodities. These commodities, calculated at market prices, were still very profitable. But this is when the difficulties arose: First, raw materials became more expensive. Originally, only 5,000 yuan was needed, but now 10,000 yuan was required. However, finished products could not be converted into cash immediately, and selling them at a reduced price was undesirable. Therefore, in bookkeeping terms, every production unit was profitable, but in reality, it was just engaging in circular activities in the process of converting funds into commodities, without any real gain. In other words: the larger the funds, the more finished products; the more commodities, the greater the need for funds. As for funds, although there is a lot of idle capital in the current isolated island, this idle capital is almost exclusively occupied by speculative ventures. Financial institutions, of course, understand the situation of industry and commerce. They know that lending to businesses in Shanghai now carries some speculative risk; where would they find funds to lend to entrepreneurs? What opportunities do entrepreneurs have to obtain loans?</p>
<p>(2) Panic About the Source of Raw Materials and the Outlet for Goods: Every industrial and commercial enterprise needs raw materials and must also find a market. Some raw materials come from the mainland, some from foreign countries, but none are produced in Shanghai, because Shanghai has no production of its own. As for the market, of course there are also foreign markets, but the main ones are Shanghai itself and the mainland. During the period of special prosperity, due to the temporary influx of population into Shanghai and the stagnation of war production, every factory felt that there were too few goods, not enough to meet the demands of the market. Recently, this favorable environment has obviously changed. As for raw materials, due to Shanghai's special environment, not only is it impossible to accurately estimate prices, but it is also impossible to have any certainty about the source. There is a large stockpile of finished products in Shanghai, but there is no new demand. As for the mainland, although it is known to be lacking a large quantity of industrial products, there is no way to transport them there. Therefore, there is panic about raw materials on one hand, and panic about inventory on the other. The lack of funds is the most difficult thing for industry and commerce, and the stagnation of inventory is a reason for insufficient capital turnover. Some people even believe that the rise in the price of inventory means that industry and commerce can continue to operate; however, this kind of bookkeeping profit only adds to the difficulties of the entire enterprise. The larger the scope of activity, the heavier this difficulty will inevitably be.</p>
<p>These two current difficulties can be said to cause panic in every industrial and commercial enterprise. But does this mean that Chinese industry and commerce has no future? Chinese industry and commerce has a future! But Shanghai's industry and commerce has no future!</p>
<p>We need to know Shanghai's special position today. The goal of so-called production enterprises is, of course, to increase the country's production capacity. But what help does Shanghai's production provide to the country? The larger the scope of Shanghai's industrial and commercial activities, the heavier the burden on the country from this "isolated island." It is the same as the more concentrated the funds, the greater the flight of capital. The country diverting a large part of its strength to maintain the "isolated island" is a huge waste. Let's just take the example of foreign rice: China has a bumper harvest this year, and originally there was no need to buy foreign rice; but because of Shanghai's excessive population and the blockage of domestic rice, the result is that the country's foreign exchange must be spent on buying foreign rice. The impact of all industrial and commercial activities on the country is exactly like this! Chinese production units and production funds hiding on an isolated island to engage in all kinds of abnormal activities is a great shame for every industrialist and businessman!</p>
<p>Industry and commerce must understand this point today. The development of Chinese industry and commerce has very good conditions, but these conditions are in the mainland, not in Shanghai. The mainland and Shanghai have created two extreme positions: the mainland lacks materials, while Shanghai has an accumulation of materials. If Chinese industrialists, businessmen, and financiers can go to the mainland to develop, not only would high industrial product prices be a good condition, but the low cost of raw materials and labor, and the large consumer base, could further strengthen this condition.</p>
<p>The various factors that made up Shanghai's special prosperity have disappeared due to the excessive expansion of industry and commerce and speculative ventures, as well as changes in various environments. If Shanghai's industry and commerce and finance industry wake up at this time, there is still an opportunity. Otherwise, they will follow the so-called "Shanghai boom" down the path of decline!</p>

<h3>Finance: Gold Bar Speculation Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold bar speculation market was quiet due to the Sunday holiday, and there were no formal market prices. However, it was heard that the off-market price had changed slightly. Initially, buyers were only bidding 4,220 yuan, but later, due to strong demand from a certain gold dealer (presumably commissioned by the Hong Kong gang), the price rose to 4,280 yuan. The situation stabilized slightly at noon. The retail selling price at money exchange shops was 4,280 yuan, but the buying price was reduced by 20 yuan. As a result, the off-market seemed slightly firmer than the previous day. The price of gold jewelry per tael at gold and silver shops remained unchanged. Dahang Bank still quoted 430 yuan, while Xintang Bank quoted 428 yuan. The buying price was reduced by about 20 yuan. Also, according to a London dispatch on the 16th, the published price of British pure gold per ounce remained at 8 pounds and 8 shillings.</p>
<h3>Spot Silver Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>According to a Bombay dispatch on the 17th, the spot price of Indian silver suddenly rose sharply again by one rupee, exceeding 60 rupees, reaching 60 rupees and 8 annas. Both the spot and September futures were flat. Also, there were no dispatches from the British and American silver markets.</p>

It is also stipulated that stock transfers will be suspended from the 15th to the 21st of this month.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market showed a slight improvement. The public association's price for 24 coarse white sugar was 57 yuan and 8 jiao at local warehouses, 57 yuan to 57 yuan and 5 jiao at other warehouses, and 45 yuan for re-export. Taikoo's White Car B mark was 62 yuan and 8 jiao at the east warehouse and 63 yuan at the west warehouse. CW mark was 62 yuan and 7 jiao, CX mark was 62 yuan and 4 jiao, DY mark was 62 yuan, HX mark was 61 yuan and 8 jiao, H mark Car Red was 46 yuan and 5 jiao, Dutch red spot was 47 yuan to 47 yuan and 5 jiao, and re-export was 39 yuan.

Haikou red and white sugar was imported by the Suiyang wheel yesterday, with more than 1,000 pieces arriving.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Hainan Longan Expected to Rise</h3>
<p>Hainan longan is said to be attracting attention from a certain party in the production area and will be subject to control, so the source is not abundant. Only 33 pieces arrived yesterday, and the asking price is expected to rise.</p>
<h3>Kelp Rises Again</h3>
<p>Due to the lack of supply of kelp, the market is short of stock every day. Dragon teeth kelp has been out of stock. Lion's mane kelp rose to 49 yuan yesterday, and imitation lion's mane kelp also requires 47 yuan. The trend is very tight.</p>
<h3>Coal: New Charcoal Arrives in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Wenzhou charcoal has been out of stock for several months since the Oujiang River was blocked, causing a fuel shortage in the city. Speculative prices have risen repeatedly, with no standard. As a result, high prices attract distant customers, and new goods from various places are being shipped in one after another, mostly by帆船. Eight or nine boats arrived at Hexia yesterday, including Daishan charcoal at 5 yuan and 5 jiao per set, large basket of Meixi green at 8 yuan per dan, and Dalian grass bag charcoal at 4 yuan and 6 jiao per bag. Street customers have a strong buying interest, and transactions are quite brisk. It is heard that the Zhejiang Charcoal Company has also been actively planning to ship Wenzhou and Taizhou firewood and charcoal since the Shenfu shipping line opened, sparing no effort. In ten days, it will become a reality, and the city's fuel will be worry-free.</p>

<p>Hygiene for Both Sexes</p>
<h3>How to Eliminate Diseases That Hinder Eugenics?</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>All organisms have reproductive behavior in the process of life, and few voluntarily abstain from desire. Even barbaric nations make marriage mandatory; they consider celibacy a sin. Therefore, many barbarians marry earlier than civilized people. Unfortunately, early marriage is also prevalent in many parts of our country. Although young people in cities do not marry early, most tend towards extramarital lust. From a eugenic point of view, this is very harmful. The result of promiscuity is a rapid decline in reproductive power, kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, and the children born will inevitably be weak and incompetent, or even unable to reproduce. This scarcity of excellent talent in children is no different from the scarcity of successors to construction projects. Of course, we absolutely do not approve of national and social undertakings being inherited from generation to generation. But we very much hope that in the future, we can reproduce more excellent talents to make all undertakings more developed and more magnificent. Only in this situation can progress be shown. Otherwise, not only will the population gradually decrease, but intelligence will also decline, which is why it is important to promote eugenics.</p>
<p>From the point of view of eugenics, on the one hand, bad physiques should be made strong, on the other hand, people with hereditary diseases should be prohibited from marrying, and on the other hand, people with excellent physiques should accelerate reproduction. Only by implementing these three aspects can we ensure the excellence of the nation's quality, and only then can we achieve a strong country and a strong race.</p>
<p>As for the diseases that hinder eugenics, none are more serious than venereal diseases. In addition, kidney deficiency, neurasthenia, premature aging, and other symptoms are also enemies of eugenics. Now that medicine is advanced, although these diseases can be cured, gonorrhea and syphilis are still spreading widely. However, there are accurate treatments for neurasthenia, premature aging, kidney deficiency, and infertility, which is due to the invention of endocrine agents.</p>
<p>We will not discuss venereal diseases here, as this is a social problem. As for kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, impotence, neurasthenia, and infertility after marriage, if we actively treat them with the German testicular essence preparation "补体康" for men, we can immediately achieve a rejuvenating effect. This is because this agent can nourish the brain, nourish the kidneys, nourish the blood, and promote the function of metabolism. After long-term use, it truly has the effect of reversing aging. Those who want to practice eugenics and enjoy the happiness of health should always take it. The female version has the effect of regulating menstruation, promoting pregnancy, and treating anemia and withered breasts.</p>

<h3>Unnecessary Gonorrhea Medication</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Is it still necessary to bring up outdated gonorrhea medications? However, the situation in society is complicated, and some stubborn people still believe that outdated gonorrhea treatments can have a radical cure. But in fact, they are often hit by these people with outdated minds. By then, although they regret it, it is too late.</p>
<p>Since I was at an American medical university, I have devoted myself to the treatment of gonorrhea and studied it. I analyzed the various oral medications for gonorrhea in various countries at that time and found that many so-called special effects medicines were just strong and domineering drugs, such as the use of sandalwood oil, cubeb, etc., which are rich in reactions and unpleasant side effects. For example, although urination temporarily reduces pain, urination will soon reduce pain and increase it, and there will be unimaginable consequences. In fact, the stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract is even greater. Patients who take these outdated proprietary medicines will have their appetite ruined. Resistance is weakened as a result, and gonorrhea also worsens as a result. Therefore, we do not need to take these oral gonorrhea medications.</p>
<p>In my many observations and experiments, the German "克淋儂" is the most superior in efficacy. After personally testing and analyzing its efficacy, I found that its bactericidal power can directly reach the lesion without harming healthy tissue. Therefore, it has a greater anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and diuretic effect. This is one of its characteristics. "克淋儂" has a very strong bactericidal power, and it does not harm healthy tissue or cause gastrointestinal irritation and vomiting. Therefore, for acute and chronic gonorrhea, you only need to take "克淋儂" to be quickly cured. For example, urethritis in acute gonorrhea, after taking "克淋儂", urination is smooth, and it can be completely cured in one or two weeks. As for chronic gonorrhea, "克淋儂" has the bactericidal power to surround gonococci, so naturally you are no longer afraid of it escaping elsewhere, so once cured, it will never recur.</p>
<h3>The Crisis of a Prolonged Cough</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>A persistent cough can damage the pleura, and over time, resistance will decrease. At this time, it is often an opportunity for tuberculosis bacteria to invade. The so-called "untreated cold becomes consumption" means this. At this time, the patient's lungs feel a stinging pain, which is a slight sign of the onset of lung disease. But if you can try your best to seek treatment in this initial stage, you can often turn danger into safety. From my more than 20 years of experience, patients can actively take the German lung-curing medicine "补肺拿尔", which has special effects in suppressing coughs and stopping tuberculosis. No matter how strong the cough, taking "补肺拿尔" can completely calm the cough within three hours, and it can also reduce the oxygen in the lungs, so that the tuberculosis bacteria lose their activity. Therefore, even if the disease has become tuberculosis, such as hemoptysis, phlegm, shortness of breath, chest pain, night sweats, and tidal fever, taking it will cure it suddenly.</p>
<h3>Truly Effective Treatment for Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>To study the treatment of nocturnal emission, we must first recognize the boundary between physiological and pathological nocturnal emission. However, this boundary is not easy to draw and varies according to each person's constitution, lifestyle, nutrition, and other conditions. According to Curschmann's opinion: "If there is no nocturnal emission when awake, and even if there is nocturnal emission during sleep, there is no fatigue or any discomfort, and the nocturnal emission is purely natural, not caused by artificial stimulation, such as self-pollution, lascivious imagination, etc., and the nocturnal emission occurs once every two or three weeks, it can be said to be physiological rather than pathological." According to this, it can be seen that feeling tired after nocturnal emission, excessive frequency, as well as daytime nocturnal emission and nocturnal emission with penile flaccidity are all pathological. Pathological nocturnal emission requires attention to recuperation, which will weaken the physical strength and lead to sexual neurasthenia, brain weakness, and kidney deficiency, which is very harmful. But as for a truly effective treatment method, in addition to paying attention to recuperation methods, the most important thing is to choose a truly effective medicine to consolidate the spermatic duct. In clinical practice, the German nocturnal emission medicine "耐而斯遗精片" is the best, according to my treatment experience. No matter how frequent the nocturnal emission or how severe the spermatorrhea, it will not occur after the first dose. Those with physical weakness should also take "补体康" with it, and the effect will be truly effective. It can also calm the brain, so it can also treat insomnia.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Anecdotes</p>
<h3>Infertility Caused by Prostatitis</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: Intersection of Ningbo Road and Sichuan Road, No. 9</p>
<p>Acute and chronic gonorrheal prostatitis often weaken fertility. In fact, substantial prostatitis is more likely to cause this result. Everyone thinks that our source is caused by the father's sperm and the mother's blood; but they do not know that sperm is the element of life. However, if there is this element, if there is no prostatic fluid, the lively and subtle sperm will inevitably be unable to survive and will wither away. In this case, the unsoundness of the prostate is the basis for male loss of fertility, and the pathogen of gonorrhea is the most likely to destroy the secretory function of the prostate. Because its destructive power is very large, and most gonorrhea patients are often treated by municipal doctors who do not know the pros and cons of inferior treatment during acute gonorrhea, or take inferior medicines on the market with rich side effects, forcing the gonococci to rush internally and destroy the secretory function of the prostate, the patient at this time is prostatitis. According to the strict statistics of our doctors, of those who suffer from gonorrheal prostatitis, nineteen have lost their fertility because the secretory function of the prostate is stopped due to the destruction of gonorrhea. If not, gonococci mixed in prostatic fluid can also poison sperm. As a result, the purpose of enabling the wife to conceive naturally cannot be achieved.</p>
<p>To save this kind of prostatitis that causes infertility, there is only a radical method: use the gonorrhea special medicine "克淋儂" as an oral medicine to completely eliminate the gonococci attached to the prostate with the "克淋儂" medicine. In this way, inflammation caused by gonorrhea and the destruction of secretory function can naturally be completely anti-inflammatory and restore normal physiological function. I also use surgery and static electricity therapy, etc., which are easy to succeed. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. From today, 20 consultations will be given every day, with each number costing only 5 jiao, and a "Complete Book of Sexually Transmitted Diseases" worth 1 yuan will be given away.</p>

<h3>Investigation of Household Registration and Restrictions on Moving: Japanese and Puppet Actions Become More Active; French Concession Strengthens Precautions in Shanghai; No New Developments in Adjusting Defense Zones</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese puppets invaded and built roads beyond the boundaries, controlling various key points, although it has not hindered the concession police from exercising police power in the Shanghai West area, the police guns at Caojiadu Wujiaochang and Yidingpan Road have been robbed one after another. Their behind-the-scenes attempt is actually to force the concession police to withdraw, so that the situation is becoming increasingly serious. Today is "September 18th", so the two concessions are more vigilant than in previous years. The various news items are recorded below.</p>
<p>Building Trenches Inside the Mansion</p>
<p>The French Concession police were very vigilant yesterday in the area of Haig Road, Difeng Road, and Foch Road. A armored vehicle was dispatched to patrol the area all day. A large number of police officers were stationed at all important intersections, searching pedestrians. Lauriston Road has been sealed off with barbed wire. More posts have been added to other intersections as well. The situation in Xujiahui is as usual. Since the Japanese puppets occupied the Lin Mansion at 448 Haig Road on the 13th, they have been arranging defensive works inside and outside for days. Yesterday, they even dug a trench, leading from inside the house to outside. The purpose is unknown.</p>
<p>Japanese Restrict Tenants from Moving</p>
<p>After the Japanese puppets took control of Siming Villa and Zhongshi New Village on Yuyuan Road, Japanese military police went to each household to investigate household registration. It was learned yesterday that the investigation has been completed. The Japanese puppets have prohibited second landlords from moving out, while third tenants can move in and out freely. In recent days, third tenants have moved out one after another. Second landlords are at a loss. According to tenants there, the Japanese puppets have long forced the collection of rent for Siming and Zhongshi, and they are afraid that once the second landlords move out, the rent will not be collected, so the restrictions are very strict. The Japanese puppets are currently reviewing the household registration of residents near Zhaofeng Park on Brenan Road. Yesterday morning, a number of Japanese military police broke into Zhaofeng Villa, inquiring about the exact amount of rent and the name of the brokerage firm, in addition to investigating household registration. After inquiring in detail, they threatened the residents, telling them that they should pay the rent to the Japanese military police from now on, and must not disobey. It is heard that the tenants of the villa have reported the situation to the landlord, but it is difficult to predict how the future will evolve.</p>
<p>Puppet Police Increase, Japanese Soldiers on Guard</p>
<p>A branch of the puppet police station has been set up at the intersection of Daxi Road and Columbia Road. The number of puppet police stationed inside has suddenly increased recently, and they are dispatched to patrol the roads from time to time. In the Anhe Temple Road area, Japanese military trucks and motorcycles are frequently passing by, which is also different from the past. At night, Japanese soldiers are also on guard at the intersection of Anhe Temple Road and Route des Soeurs.</p>
<p>Defense Works Completed Yesterday</p>
<p>Part of the building of the Cilian Branch No. 31 Shelter at 11 Avenue Haig, was occupied by Japanese puppets on the 9th, to be used for a purpose. Yesterday, the Japanese puppets announced to the shelter that they would build a house on a large open space inside the house. Once completed, the occupied house could be returned and still allow refugees to live in it. Since the night before, the Japanese puppets have changed to enter and exit through the side door (that is, the entrance and exit of the refugee children's middle school), and they have been coming and going frequently. The sandbag defense works built by the puppet police station on Kaner Road have been completed yesterday.</p>
<p>Negotiations on Shanghai West Incident to Continue</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundary in Shanghai West, Philip, Director-General and Commissioner-General of the Public Works Department, visited the puppet "Mayor" Chuan Xiao'an in the city center on the 15th for direct negotiations. The content of the talks was not announced, but according to reliable sources, the two exchanged views on police power, taxation, and other important issues related to road construction beyond the boundary during the talks the day before, and established a basis for continued discussion. However, Mr. Philip has not yet allowed to release the progress and detailed circumstances of the discussion the day before.</p>
<p>Investigating Defense Zones Under Consideration</p>
<p>Commander Shihuto of the Japanese Navy Landing Force in Shanghai invited the commanders of the British, American, and Italian defense forces stationed in Shanghai to a meeting on the 13th, suggesting adjusting the defense zones and stating that he would submit a concrete plan in a few days. The commanders of the defense forces of various countries did not agree at that time, but only agreed to submit it to the staff meeting of the three countries for study. It is now learned that since the arrival of Commander Hews of the US Asia Fleet in Shanghai, the commanders of the defense forces of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Italy have had repeated contact, and are now conducting a thorough study of the Japanese proposal in order to propose a counterproposal. How it will develop is unknown, but according to sources, a second meeting of the commanders of the defense forces of various countries will be convened in the shortest possible time. The rumor that the British defense zone will be filled by the US military within one or two days could not be confirmed yesterday, but it is believed to be the opinion of some foreigners.</p>
<p>The Situation North of the Suzhou Creek is as Usual</p>
<p>It has been rumored for days that the Japanese are coveting the British defense zone north of the Suzhou Creek, and intend to blockade the area from the west of North Jiangxi Road to Tibet Road. The reporter from Dazhong News Agency went to the above-mentioned areas for inspection yesterday afternoon and witnessed that everything was as usual. The gap at the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road leading to North Sichuan Road is still guarded by two Japanese soldiers and has not been increased. The passage permits of passers-by are strictly checked. The bottom of North Jiangxi Road at the intersection of Bazilu Road is still guarded by British soldiers. The barbed wire at the intersection of North Henan Road and Jielu Road leading to Baoshan Road is still blocked as before. The Japanese army is still stationed on the north side of Jielu Road. The intersection of Tibet Road and Haining Road is also guarded by British soldiers. However, according to a resident of Junyili on Elgin Road, someone went to the neighborhoods the day before and told the residents to live in peace of mind. The Japanese will not take over the area north of the Suzhou Creek until the 10th of next month. After that, residents must have a pass.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Wenzhou Navigation Obstructed Again</h3>
<p>After the resumption of navigation on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, the Shenfu Wheel of the Yilong Shipping Company and the Xin'anli Wheel of the Weili Han Company sailed to Wenzhou first a few days ago. According to the Japanese, they are threatening to blockade Wenzhou Bay again, so the Shanghai-Wenzhou line seems to be obstructed again. The British Far East Shipping Company's Yongtai Wheel, which was originally scheduled to depart for Wenzhou tomorrow (19th), has prepared to suspend sailing to Wenzhou and change to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Black Market Exchange Rate Fluctuations Do Not Harm China's Resistance War; Becomes a Center for Japanese and Puppet Regimes to Obtain Foreign Exchange; A Playground for Speculators to Stir Up Trouble</h3>
<p>Shanghai has always been China's trade center, its economic hub, and the only major port in the Far East. Forty-five percent of the country's foreign trade is concentrated here, and because of its position as a trade and financial hub, it has become the center of foreign exchange supply. The national foreign exchange market regards it as the standard. Therefore, its exchange rate fluctuations affect the status of the entire Chinese currency system. After the war, the economic center of China's resistance war shifted to the southwestern provinces, and the foreign trade center was mainly the Yunnan-Vietnam and Burma roads. Trade and finance were also dispersed in Kunming, Hanoi, Rangoon, Hong Kong and other places. The connection between the Shanghai foreign exchange market and the Chinese government and its resistance war economy is far less important than its connection with China's economic lifeline before the war. Since the government managed domestic exchange, Shanghai capital can freely move inland, while the capital of the southwestern provinces, due to Shanghai exchange restrictions, cannot freely flow into the Shanghai market. Therefore, the impact of Shanghai's foreign exchange speculation on the movement of inland funds is far less than before the war. Although Shanghai's economic position today is still mainly in the Yangtze River basin, its economic control is no longer within the reach of the Chinese government. The economic impact of black market foreign exchange fluctuations in Shanghai has nothing to do with the foundation of the resistance war. Therefore, the Shanghai foreign exchange rate can no longer represent China's true foreign purchasing power, and the Shanghai foreign exchange market has become a center for Japanese and puppet regimes to obtain foreign exchange and a playground for speculative merchants to stir up trouble. Therefore, China's Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee no longer maintains the Shanghai black market foreign exchange market and allows it to develop naturally. However, the foreign exchange in areas outside the occupied territories remains stable after efforts to maintain it, and the official price has never changed.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Unmilled Rice and Flour Transported to Tianjin for Relief</h3>
<p>Since the flood in Tianjin, there has been an unusual panic about food. Therefore, the demand is very high. A certain party purchased 300,000 dan of national rice in Wuhu and transported it to Tianjin for relief. Tianjin businessmen in Shanghai have also ordered a large quantity of flour, and more than 400,000 bags have been purchased. However, the loading and transportation are very difficult. British ships only go to Tanggu, and the Taikoo Dockyard Company has no warehouses. Therefore, only Jardine Matheson has warehouses for loading. A batch was transported last Friday, and another 37,100 bags were transported to Tianjin today. It is reported that a large number of Japanese ships have been used for transportation.</p>
<h3>Today is the September 18th Anniversary; The Entire City is Under Tight Security; Police Officers from Both Concessions and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps Mobilized for Guard Duty and Strict Searches; Obstacles Placed at Connecting Points</h3>
<p>Today is the anniversary of the "September 18th Incident." In addition to mobilizing all police forces from the Public Concession and the French Concession police authorities, along with the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, to step up patrols and strictly search pedestrians and vehicles, the traffic on both sides of Edward Road and Avenue Foch, which connect the two concessions, is also arranged with obstacles, as stipulated during the "August 13th" incident, and patrolmen are dispatched to guard the area. In the Public Concession, only Szechuan Road, Fukien Road, Chekiang Road, Yu Ya-ching Road, Tongfu Road, Seymour Road, Hart Road, etc., are left with connecting passages. In the French Concession, only Rue du Consulat, Avenue Foch, Route des Soeurs, Avenue Albert, and Route Courbet can be used for traffic. However, all pedestrians and vehicles must be inspected, and the curfew is strictly enforced. In addition, police vehicles and armored vehicles from both concessions are also dispatched at the same time to patrol back and forth.</p>
<p>Patrolmen and Volunteer Corps on Standby</p>
<p>The Public Concession Police Department issued a notice to all police officers on the afternoon of the 16th, informing all departments to temporarily cancel the regular leave of all police officers and patrolmen, and to restore it after the festival. At the same time, all requests for leave are also temporarily prohibited, so that all officers do not leave their posts, so as to facilitate deployment. In addition, the entire Shanghai Volunteer Corps will be mobilized to assist police officers in their work. Therefore, the Shanghai Volunteer Corps commander issued an order yesterday, instructing all members to wear their uniforms during office hours and await orders.</p>
<p>All Sectors Suspend Banquets and Entertainment</p>
<p>The "September 18th" Northeast Incident was the beginning of Japan's invasion of Chinese territory. All sectors of the country must gather to commemorate this day to express their grief. Today is the eighth anniversary. All sectors of the city will not hold any commemorative ceremonies due to the special environment, nor will they lower the flag to half-mast. However, they have decided to voluntarily suspend entertainment and banquets. Most citizens will voluntarily abstain from meat for one day to express their firm and unwavering will and to firmly believe that the resistance war will be won and the nation will be built.</p>
<h3>Upon Notification from the Concession Authorities, Rice Sales are Temporarily Suspended Today; Order in Various Districts was Slightly Better Yesterday; Crowding for Rice is Still Difficult to Alleviate; The Second Round of Rice Sales is Being Planned</h3>
<p>The rice sales offices in the two concessions were open as usual yesterday, Sunday, and increased the supply of rice for sale, with a maximum of 200 bags per location. The order in various locations was slightly better yesterday. Many people were crowded together, vying to buy rice. Those who arrived later had no space. The situation at the third location was tense and did not end until 8:00 PM. The Rice Merchants Association was notified by the authorities of both concessions yesterday that rice sales would be temporarily suspended for one day during the September 18th anniversary period and would resume as usual on the 19th. Various organizations and the Rice Merchants Association are planning to hold a second round of rice sales. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Sales Open as Usual Yesterday</p>
<p>The five rice sales offices in the two concessions were open as usual yesterday, Sunday, and increased the supply of rice for sale, with a maximum of 300 bags per location. After arrangements were made, the order in various locations was slightly better all day yesterday. Many people were crowded together, vying to buy rice. The reporter from New Voice News visited the five rice sales offices in the two concessions all day yesterday. On the way, the reporter encountered an endless stream of civilians, all carrying flour bags or bamboo baskets, rushing to the nearest rice sales office. However, the weather was not good, and it was raining lightly from time to time, and the roads were quite muddy, and many women and children returned in frustration. The reporter went to various rice sales offices and saw that all of them were crowded with a large number of civilians, and the voices were noisy. As a result of the crowding, those who arrived later had no space and waited outside the venue.</p>
<p>Authorities Notify of Temporary Suspension Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Merchants Association, which is handling the sale of 8,000 bags of Saigon rice from various organizations, was notified by the police authorities of the two concessions yesterday that an accident might occur today, the September 18th anniversary. After receiving the notification from the authorities, the Rice Merchants Association immediately informed the five rice sales offices, saying, "Dear Sirs, we hereby inform you that we have been notified by the authorities of the two concessions that all rice sales offices should suspend rice sales for one day during the security period of the September 18th anniversary and resume rice sales as usual on the 19th. We are sending you a notice for posting to inform the public. Sincerely, to the Xth Rice Sales Office." The notice reads, "We hereby notify you that we have been notified by the Public Concession and the French Concession that all rice sales offices will suspend rice sales for one day during the security period of the September 18th anniversary and resume rice sales as usual on the 19th. This is hereby announced."</p>
<p>Order at Five Locations Slightly Better</p>
<p>Because of the crowding of buyers of rice for sale on the first day (16th), a tragedy occurred at the fourth location, Shandong Guild Hall, No. 491 Ximen Road and Rue Lubin Road. Yesterday, on the second day, the persons in charge of each location made strict arrangements in advance, with ropes and bamboo rafts and wooden fences. However, as soon as the door was unlocked, a large number of civilians rushed in, vying to buy rice tickets at the ticket office. Colorful banknotes flew in front of the counter. The reporter stood and watched from afar, seeing that the order at the rice distribution point was orderly. The internal staff first collected the rice tickets from the rice buyers and then paid them rice. All the rice sales venues were protected by a large number of armed constables. The situation at the second rice sales office at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Route Cardinal was also tense and did not end until late at night. The rice sales office at the North Honan Road and Old Race Course Road temporarily suspended rice sales yesterday afternoon. All 100 bags of unmilled rice were transferred to the second rice sales office.</p>
<p>Organizations Plan Second Round of Rice Sales</p>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter from New Voice News learned from various organizations that the sale of 8,000 bags of Saigon rice was a drop in the bucket and would not solve the problem. However, the various organizations are planning and preparing for the second round of rice sales and will begin as soon as it is ready. The public can wait patiently. As for the first round of rice sales of Saigon rice, it will be sold out in 8,000 bags. All rice industry organizations are actively dredging the source of national rice in order to transport it to Shanghai for adjustment. Buyers at the five rice sales offices bought at most one peck. Yesterday, the Rice Merchants Association stamped the two-sheng rice ticket with the words "Add eight sheng," so that civilians who bought this rice ticket could get one peck of rice.</p>
<p>Police Strive to Maintain Order</p>
<p>Yesterday's situation at each rice sales office: the first office was assigned one foreign constable, one Indian constable, and twelve Chinese constables to maintain order. Because the location was close to the Japanese defense zone on Old Race Course Road and Paoshan Road, and it was the eve of the September 18th Incident, the rice sales were stopped at 12:00 noon, and there were no rice sales in the afternoon. The second district was assigned four foreign constables, one Indian constable, and twenty Chinese constables, who used wire mesh and ropes to block the Kuo Kuang Middle School into a corridor to proceed in an orderly manner. In consideration of the crowd standing in the rain for a long time, the rice sales were opened one hour earlier (7:00 AM) and the time was extended until 300 bags of rice were sold out. The third office was assigned more than 20 Chinese and foreign detectives, who used wire mesh to block the entrances and exits. By 3:00 PM, all 300 bags of rice for sale had been sold out. Because of the tragedy that occurred the day before at the fourth location, 20 Chinese and foreign detectives completely blocked the traffic on the Ximen Road section between Route Saopun and Rue Lubin Road at 7:00 AM yesterday morning. Rice buyers entered the entrance on Route Saopun, lined up and entered the iron gate on the right side of the Shandong Guild Hall, and then walked out of Rue Lubin Road, so the order was orderly. The fifth location also had good order with the addition of wire mesh at the entrance.</p>
<p>Statistics of Number of Bags Sold Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, 199 bags were sold at the first location, 300 bags at the second location, and 200 bags at the third location, with more than 3,000 buyers and a revenue of more than 4,900 yuan.

<h3>Empress of Asia Arrives in Shanghai from Hong Kong; Carries Large Quantities of Mail and Goods; A Major Theft Occurred En Route</h3>
<p>The Empress of Asia, a ship of the British Chang Hing Steamship Company, was about to berth in the Whangpoo River when the European War broke out. The ship stayed in the port for many days before being ordered by the British Admiralty to lift the ban and sail to Manila. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, the ship arrived in Shanghai from the Philippines via Hong Kong and berthed at the Kung Ho Hsiang Wharf. The hull was painted gray.

<h3>Central Bank's New Notes to be Finalized Soon; Undecided Whether to Add Marks or Reprint; Counterfeit Substitute Coupons Flood the Market, Causing Concern</h3>
<p>The Central Bank's new subsidiary currency notes are about to be finalized by experts and will be issued soon. The stamp problem has been shelved, and the post office has no plan to recall them. Counterfeit substitute coupons have been continuously discovered on the market, causing great harm. The various situations are explored as follows:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank's one-fen and five-fen new subsidiary currency notes, after the discovery of counterfeit notes copied from sample drafts, suspended the issuance and repeatedly telegraphed the head office for instructions. After the head office gave detailed instructions, it not only made representations to the Yong Ning Company in Hong Kong, but also had experts begin to study countermeasures. According to news from the branch yesterday, the research work on the issuance of the one-fen and five-fen new notes is about to be completed. However, it is still not disclosed whether the notes will be stamped with a hidden mark or reprinted with a different design before being issued. It is only known that the issuance date of the new notes is not far off. The design and date have not been announced. According to the meaning of secrecy, it is not willing to make an early announcement, fearing that villains will imitate and cause trouble. As for the urgent need for the issuance of new notes from all sectors and the difficulty of the market lacking subsidiary coins and change, the bank authorities are very concerned and expect to fundamentally solve the serious problem soon.</p>
<p>Stamps Shelved, Counterfeit Coupons Flood</p>
<p>Regarding the 400,000 stamps previously circulating on the market, according to a spokesperson for the post office, the Kunming General Post Office has not yet issued any instructions. Therefore, there is no possibility of recalling the stamps. Other than slightly damaged ones being allowed to be used, there is no other solution. Moreover, the Shanghai Post Office is not considering this issue at present. It is also known that because the paper and labor costs of the substitute coupons previously issued by various industries are low, counterfeit coupons have recently flooded the market. For example, the Public Concession Tramway Company's three-fen coupons (August), the Wing On Company's one-fen and three-fen coupons, and the Hutchison Company's one-fen and three-fen coupons have been recalled in full due to the discovery of counterfeit coupons. In recent days, the Cheng Tai Silk and Cloth Shop on Avenue Haig in Zikawei has also discovered counterfeit coupons mixed in with its issued one-fen and five-fen substitute coupons, causing great harm to the common people. It has announced that it will be recalled in full before the 18th of this month.</p>

<h3>Incident of Two Foreign Journalists Detained in Ji'an; Sent to Chinese Army Headquarters for Questioning; Transferred to Ningbo and Then Returned to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that two former journalists, Belden of the Associated Press and Fomo, a former reporter for the Continental Daily, recently went to Chongqing and were detained by the Chinese army in Ji'an, Jiangxi. They were released after several days and arrived in Shanghai yesterday (16th) from Ningbo. According to them, they set off from Shanghai at the end of last month and advanced to Chongqing along an inland road with few travelers. They were transported by long-distance bus along the way. They had to get up at 2:00 AM every morning to buy tickets for the next stop on time. This was a difficulty during the journey. Upon arrival in Ji'an, they stayed overnight. When about to depart, Belden's toes suddenly became painful from the rushing. The two men delayed their departure for several hours. At that time, the local police saw them and questioned them. When examining their passports, it was discovered that Belden lacked some documents, and he was detained by the authorities. Fomo's passport was complete, so he was allowed to continue on his way, but Fomo refused to leave his friend and was also detained. In order to notify Chongqing, the two men started making phone calls and sending telegrams, but both were ineffective, because the telephone lines were interrupted when they called, and there was no reply when they sent wireless telegrams.</p>
<p>The local authorities finally told the two men that they had to be sent back to the Shangrao headquarters of the Chinese army for questioning. Belden and Fomo finally made contact with a senior local official, who arranged for them to be sent back to Ningbo. During the five-day return trip, they were constantly monitored by the police.</p>

Recently, the family moved to 79 Wenlin Road in the French Concession, hoping that his wife would sever ties with Yang. Li found a job as a gatekeeper at 322 Liangxing Lane, 116 Wenlin Road. Unexpectedly, his wife, Li Jiang, secretly continued to associate with Yang, frequently calling him or going out for clandestine meetings. Yesterday at noon, Li Guangming discovered this, rushed home, and scolded his wife, leading to an argument. At that time, Li's mother-in-law, Jiang, came out to protect her daughter and reprimand her son-in-law, causing Li Guangming to become angry and unable to vent his frustration. He took out his work-issued six-round lotus-shaped pistol and fired six shots at his wife and mother-in-law. Both Li Jiang and Jiang Xue were hit by two bullets each. Li Jiang was hit in the upper left breast and left waist and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. Jiang Xue was hit in the upper left breast and abdomen, hitting vital organs, and died instantly on the spot. After the incident, nearby police officers heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene. Li tried to raise the gun to commit suicide, but he was out of bullets. The police arrested him and took him and the pistol back to the Beitang Road Police Station for investigation. The police sent detectives to investigate. The injured Li Jiang was transported to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Jiang Xue's body was sent to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Parlor for an autopsy, which will be reported to the Second Special Court for an investigation today. Li Jiang's injuries are also quite serious, and her life is in danger. Because Li's three children have no one to care for them, the police sent them to Guangci Hospital for temporary care, pending a decision after the case is closed.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Football Association Resolves: League Games to Proceed as Usual; Opening Game Postponed to October 7th; Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Games Still to be Held</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong, 12th Dispatch) Although the European war has broken out, the Hong Kong football competition will proceed as usual. The Hong Kong Football Association decided at last night's committee meeting that the games in each group will continue to be held. This is good news for football fans. The meeting was chaired by Mr. Huang Jiajun. Representatives from the army and navy advocated holding the games as usual. The result was unanimously passed. Only the opening date of the league was postponed from September 23rd to October 7th. A charity match will be held on October 10th, and the Governor of Hong Kong has been invited to kick off the game at that time. Regarding the interport game, Huang Jiajun reported that the Hong Kong Association had sent a message to the Shanghai West Man Football Club, suggesting that if the interport game ends in a tie, the game should be extended for twenty minutes (half for ten minutes). The Shanghai Association still advocates an extension of thirty minutes (half for fifteen minutes). Mr. Huang also reported that the South China Football Team is currently competing in Nanyang and will be difficult to return to Hong Kong for the time being.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Football Friendly Match: Oriental Wins Against Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from our newspaper) The golden breeze is refreshing, and the jade dew is cool; it is truly the season for football matches. The Oriental Football Club specially held a friendly match against the Overseas Chinese team at the Hong Kong Club field. Oriental fielded a new lineup, and the Overseas Chinese team also had many talented players and strong capabilities. After the start of the match, both sides exchanged attacks and defenses, with Oriental scoring seven goals and Overseas Chinese achieving five. However, twenty minutes into the second half, the referee, Mr. Shepherd, suddenly announced the termination of the match against Overseas Chinese, seemingly stating that the team's actions had exceeded the norm. Thus, this friendly match ended on an unpleasant note. The fans who bought tickets and took their seats frequently complained that it was not worth it.</p>
<p>In terms of both teams' skills, Oriental's offensive accounted for 70% of the entire match. The entire team had excellent coordination. Zhang Jinhai shone brightly, personally scoring five goals. Bei Hua and Cheng Tao performed their best. Zhong Yongsen, who replaced Chen Bingshi, also had a good performance. Xian Han's goalkeeping skills have improved significantly. Wu Qixiang and Luo Weiquan defended effectively, and the center back line performed well. Xu Jingcheng and Liu Aihu were versatile, assisting in both attack and defense, making them truly the pillars of Oriental.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese' Li Deqi's strange shots were amazing, maintaining his usual style. De Rong also had good plays. During yesterday's match, he powerfully shot from 30 yards out, with exquisite skill, earning a lot of applause. De Pu was steady, Shou Qi underperformed, and all the forwards worked hard. The loss of several goals was due to the fighting spirit, but Zhong Yuzhi's strength was lacking.</p>
<p>After the start of the match, Oriental charged left and right, with several Shanghai generals acting like tigers and wolves. Jin Hai seized the opportunity and scored the first goal. Shortly after, Jin Hai successively scored four more goals. Overseas Chinese counterattacked, and Li Si showed his strange kicking skills, pulling back one goal. Cheng Tao lay in wait in front of the goal, seizing the opportunity to score a goal. De Rong powerfully kicked from 30 yards out, sending the ball into the net with exquisite footwork, making it 5-2. Soon after, De Rong sent a long pass, and Wen Gui shot the ball into the center of the goal. Finally, Bei Hua slid past Overseas Chinese's copper wall in front of the goal, making the score 6-3 in the first half. In the second half, Overseas Chinese boosted their morale. Li Si passed the ball, and Wen Gui dashed in and flicked the ball into the net. Deqi then displayed his copper head in front of the goal, bringing the score close at 6-5. Zhang Jinhai completed the score to 7-5. Shortly after, the referee blew the whistle, announcing the termination of the match.</p>

<h3>Charity Tennis Tournament: Diverse Program Held for Two Days, This Month on the 23rd and 24th for Two Consecutive Days</h3>
<p>The charity tennis tournament has been rescheduled to the 23rd and 24th of this month. Due to the diverse and interesting program, each exciting event has been scheduled over two days.

The skills of these Mecca tennis players are generally derived from hard practice, so their techniques are considered superior to those of amateur players. Now, each professional player is enthusiastic about charity and has volunteered to move the once-a-year Mecca competition to the same day as the charity match. This is a rare opportunity, and everyone who hears about it is eager to witness it. In addition, famous amateur tennis players Wang Wenzheng, Liang Deguang, and Xu Chengwei, who have been away from Shanghai for a long time, have decided to return and collaborate with rising stars Zhang Dingzhao, Li Guofan, Tang Baojia, and others to perform in the charity match, which can be described as "beautiful and rare." It is said that everyone believes that this charity match offers the opportunity to watch the skills of famous players on one hand, and to help refugees on the other, so despite the slightly higher ticket prices, they are happy to purchase them. Furthermore, it is understood that the sales of these tickets have been very successful so far, with the highest achievement being that of Mr. Chen Qihai, who is only fourteen years old.</p>

<h3>Exercise and Rest</h3>
<p>— Shi Kaixian</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of exercise, rest is always necessary afterward. This is not limited to humans or other animals. Even inanimate objects, if only exercised without rest, will not function properly. Only exercising without rest will result in damage or even the end of its life. For example, a machine that runs all day will be easily damaged if not given rest. The same applies to humans. After each exercise, there must be sufficient time to rest, because rest can trigger metabolism, restoring the energy consumed during exercise. Otherwise, if energy is continuously depleted without rest, the body's energy will soon be exhausted. Without energy, how can there be life?</p>
<p>Sleep is the greatest form of rest. In school, after every hour of class, there is always a ten-minute break. This is because the brain is exercised during the hour, so this ten minutes is used to rest the brain, allowing it to replenish what was consumed before. Playing ball also includes a considerable amount of time for rest. Movie theaters also have a ten-minute intermission halfway through a movie. This is because the projector has been running for a long time, and both the projectionist and the audience's eyes need rest.</p>
<p>However, exercise and rest must be balanced. One cannot only rest without exercising. Resting without exercising is laziness. Many people often use the word "rest" as an excuse. For example, they clearly are not studying, but insist they are resting. They clearly are not working, but insist they are resting. How much resting there is! If there is rest, there must be exercise, and if there is exercise, there must be rest. If there is no exercise, why rest? Isn't this contradictory? Conversely, only exercising without rest cannot be considered diligence. The two must be balanced. Lacking either exercise or rest is harmful. In other words, if exercise and rest are properly distributed, consumption will never be complete. What is consumed in the front is immediately replenished in the back.</p>
<h3>New Invention: All-Weather Clothing</h3>
<p>— Yang Mei</p>
<p>If a person wears a brand new outfit to visit friends or go out, and suddenly encounters heavy rain along the way, then this person will surely be soaked like a drowned chicken, and this brand new outfit will become old. This major drawback in clothing has always been annoying to many people, but there is no way to prevent it. Suppose one were to put on a raincoat first! But this is also considered troublesome and inconvenient. Now there are all-weather shoes and all-weather hats on the market, but London has recently discovered all-weather clothing.</p>
<p>The raw materials of all-weather clothing are a combination of artificial cellulose and Manila hemp (produced in South Africa and the Malay Archipelago). The discoverer of this Manila hemp is Mr. John Lywesinton, an engineer at a hat factory in London's Whistenn Hat Factory. In 1920, when Lywesinton discovered Manila hemp, he first filtered it in the factory, extracting its lubricating and absorbent purple liquid to make hats, and invented a rainproof hat the following year.</p>
<p>According to a report in the London Express on the 7th of this month, Lywesinton continued to invent a type of "all-weather outerwear," and he has partnered with a certain major merchant to begin manufacturing it on Venice Street next to London's East Station, with an estimated output of 10,000 pieces of all-weather outerwear before November.</p>
<p>This all-weather clothing is no different from ordinary suits, with silk or wool variations, but it is slightly more expensive. It is said that a major company in this city has already ordered 200 pieces of clothing from the factory, with news of their arrival in Shanghai in January next year. It seems that this all-weather clothing will soon be available to the island residents.</p>
<h3>Telephone Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Lai</p>
<p>Please Wait for the Dial Tone</p>
<p>When using the telephone, the first task is to wait for the dial tone. In the past, when a person picked up the receiver, they could immediately hear the dial tone, but currently, due to the urgent situation of world war, the number of people using the telephone has increased dramatically, and Shanghai's telephone service has also been affected. Recently, in Shanghai, both men and women have increased their telephone calls. The peak period is from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM in the central district. This is because the central district contains trading markets, banks, newspapers, administrative agencies, military agencies, consulates, and shipping companies, all of which need to exchange war news, inquire about various market prices, and conduct daily business.</p>
<p>The telephone company's exchanges are generally able to handle the increased number of telephone calls, but the current situation is a special occurrence. The sudden increase in the number of calls, concentrated in a certain period, is therefore not a problem of equipment capacity, and there is no need to increase equipment to meet the demand. This is similar to the situation when movie theaters release their audiences, and streetcars line up in front, sometimes suddenly announcing that they are full; or when banks are crowded with depositors at the end of the month, or when ships depart from the port, and those seeing them off are crowded. When everyone starts to perform the same action, a special situation arises. The obstacle in telephone service is the relatively slow dial tone. Users can only wait quietly. This phenomenon is not due to the telephone company's poor service, but rather due to the urgent situation around the world and the particularly busy exchanges in various industries in the city.</p>
<p>Some telephone users feel annoyed while waiting for the dial tone. Therefore, they take the telephone receiver off and place it on the table, continuing their work, and occasionally pick up the receiver to listen for the dial tone. Telephone exchanges with operators also connect the trunk line to the outside and constantly listen for the dial tone to arrive. This action is practically useless and can even disrupt the normal speed of telephone service. The Shanghai Telephone Company has conducted an investigation and reported that many users do not immediately dial the number even when the dial tone is available.</p>
<p>Currently, whether it is ships, trains, airplanes, commerce, or even telegrams and mail, all services are experiencing delays. Some services have even been suspended. As for the telephone, telephone users in the central district are most likely to feel the inconvenience of the slow dial tone; however, the Shanghai Telephone Company has already taken steps to add equipment to meet this current urgent need. However, some machines cannot be prepared in a short period, but it is expected that this situation will be gradually eliminated from mid-September.</p>
<h3>A Week's Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>To have meat dishes every day, it's nothing more than meat and fish; it seems a bit monotonous, so it's good to change the flavors. To change flavors, then crab is an outstanding choice. Although large crabs are not yet on the market, small crabs have long appeared in the vegetable market. For three cents, you can buy ten to twelve, enough for two meals, day and night. There are generally three ways to cook crabs. One is to cut the whole crab into two halves and braise it with vegetables. The second is to cut the crab into two halves, dredge it in flour, add some edamame and meat, and braise it together. The third is to stir-fry crab roe, which is a bit more complicated. The first step is to heat the crab, then extract the roe and meat, and stir-fry it with chives and egg flowers. It's best to stir-fry it with some lard. If you think there are too few ingredients and not enough to chew on, then add some shredded meat to it, and the flavor will be even more delicious.</p>

<h3>How to Purchase Furniture for the Home</h3>
<p>Li Ping</p>
<p>In this day and age, starting a family is not an easy task. Even just the interior decoration of the home is enough to study. Now let's talk about how to furnish a home, which I think readers would also be happy to hear about!</p>
<p>The interior decoration of the home is mainly based on furniture. If the furniture is purchased properly, it will not only save money but also increase the comfort of life. Now let's explain the most important conditions, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Economy: In this time of soaring prices, wood is no exception. Therefore, the cost of furniture for a family will definitely be very high. If, for the sake of newlyweds and the passion of getting married, one disregards everything and buys as much as possible to please the other party, causing future economic panic, that is a big mistake. Therefore, before starting a family, first choose a few of the most necessary furniture items to buy, and those that are not urgent can be purchased monthly. This is the best approach when finances are tight.</p>
<p>(2) Practicality: Using money for appropriate consumption is the right thing to do. Conversely, it leads to extravagance and waste. It is common to see that the furniture in old-fashioned homes tends to be bulky. The so-called "solemn and grand" is their motto. Therefore, there are many impractical things that are left empty every day. This is as ridiculous as the fools in the countryside who buried money underground in the past. In this era, it will not only fail to win praise from others but will also make people feel annoyed. Once the source of income is cut off, it has to be sold off. Aren't those wooden items in the auction houses all coming from this way? How unwise! Young couples should believe this.</p>
<p>(3) Art: Since the home is a place for daily living, furniture is also something that is in daily contact. If one studies the form and color of the furniture with ideals and needs in mind, then one will receive indescribable comfort from them. The colors of ordinary wooden furniture are mostly brown or black, and the shapes are no more than square, round, rectangular, or semicircular, with limited uses. One can freely choose one's favorite forms and colors. In short, furniture should be small, simple, and beautiful. These conditions should be based on economy.</p>

<h3>The Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation of the Three Giants of the European War</h3>
<p>— Mu Feng</p>
<p>— Chamberlain, Daladier, Mościcki —</p>
<p>The Second European War has broken out again, and people around the world are concerned about the development of the war situation every day, and even more attentively watching the whereabouts and actions of the three giants. Here, let's talk about their clothing, food, housing, and transportation.</p>
<p>Clothing: Chamberlain and Daladier both have very valuable pieces of clothing. During the coronation ceremony of King George VI in 1934, Chamberlain put a lot of thought and effort into the arrangements and preparations for this ceremony. Later, King George was very grateful to him and had a silver bear skin, which was stored in Buckingham Palace, made into an evening dress for him. It is said that this bear skin was a gift from the King of Romania to the King of England, so now whenever winter comes, if Chamberlain wants to meet with the King of England, he often wears this bear skin dress. As for Daladier, he bought a pine marten coat (pine martens are produced in Lithuania, but the yield is very small, so it is considered valuable) worth 2,600 francs in Paris five years ago. Whenever there are major banquets or outdoor hunting, Daladier often wears it. As for Mościcki, he doesn't like to wear fancy clothes. His clothes are very clean, but the materials are the same as those of the upper-middle class, so his frugality is rare among the world's heads of state.</p>
<p>Food: Chamberlain likes to eat Rivers turkeys and Gulingguo (a specialty of Bosnia), and there are probably always shipments of these coming on the postal ships from Bosnia. Besides Chamberlain, Foreign Secretary Halifax also likes them. Daladier and Mościcki are very casual about food, but Daladier has a fondness for Ligencin grapes produced in Yugoslavia.</p>
<p>Housing: In addition to a gorgeous official residence in London, Chamberlain's private residence in the town of Divisoughton is built very splendidly. Some people estimate its value to be at least 8 million pounds, so one can imagine. In addition to the Prime Minister's Office, Daladier has as many as five private residences, but their splendor is far inferior to Chamberlain's private residence. And Mościcki? He lives year-round in the Chentanaya Prime Minister's Office in Warsaw, and his family also lives together. He doesn't have a private residence, which is truly unique among heads of state.</p>
<p>Transportation: Chamberlain is a traveler, and he often carries an umbrella and rushes around. Daladier, on the other hand, is a lover of music, and he likes to listen to plays in the theater or sing famous songs. And Mościcki, known for his frugality and hard work? Because he is the son of a hunter, he made a living by hunting in his youth, so now he also regards hunting as his only hobby. (I am especially grateful to Counselor Huang of the Central Embassy for providing a lot of information for this article.)</p>

<h3>A Few Opinions on Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>— Yin Sanlang</p>
<p>Editor: The foreign rice ordered from Saigon by various social organizations and Mr. Yu Qiaqing has arrived in Shanghai in the first batch of 18,000 bags. In addition to using 10,000 bags to relieve refugees, the remaining 8,000 bags have been decided to be sold at stable prices. The Rice Industry Association has set up five price stabilization points in the two concessions and started selling at stable prices. We are truly admirable for the warm concern of various organizations and benefiting the common people, but we have a few opinions, hoping that the authorities can find ways to improve and achieve the goal of truly benefiting the common people.</p>
<p>(1) There are only five price stabilization points in the British and French Concessions, which is too few, resulting in tragedies due to extreme congestion. Therefore, we hope that more price stabilization points can be set up.</p>
<p>(2) In order to remedy the above shortcomings, our opinion is that it may be possible to entrust various rice shops to handle price stabilization, but it must be limited to a certain number of bags per day. Even if someone cannot buy it today, they will have the hope of buying it tomorrow. This will not only alleviate the danger of excessive congestion but also give more opportunities for the poor to buy.</p>
<p>(3) Now is the time when new rice is coming on the market, but the price of rice has still not fallen. There must be unscrupulous merchants deliberately manipulating it. Therefore, on the one hand, we are passively carrying out price stabilization to relieve the poor, but the authorities should also actively and strictly investigate unscrupulous merchants who hoard and speculate. At the same time, we must continue to expand the order of foreign rice, because this can gradually suppress the price of rice and make it fall back.</p>
<h3>Quick Sketch of Price Stabilization on Carter Road</h3>
<p>— Sick Big Bug</p>
<p>Early morning, the sun hid in the clouds, gloomy, as if a heavy rain was about to come. Carter Road was crowded with people's heads, old and young, men and women, carrying baskets and bags, pouring into the rice-selling open space, truly like the autumn tide flooding. There were many children with the smell of milk still wet, like little ducks, drifting with the tide, and there were also many white-haired old men and small-footed old women, like a herd of old water buffalo, unable to withstand the impact of the tide, leaning on the fence and sighing.</p>
<p>Then, several yellow-clad police officers came, carrying wooden sticks, wanting to drive away these little ducks or old buffaloes, but who knew that they were probably starving, and would rather be beaten than surge forward. The foreign patrol shook his neck, had a flash of inspiration, and ordered the patrolmen to close the fence door, letting people watch the white cloth banner of the "Rice Industry Association Second District Price Stabilization Office" fly very arrogantly, but there were still a group who were unwilling to lose everything" and waited. An old man with a snow-white beard was sitting by the roadside sighing, "Alas! I got up at 5:30 in the morning, and I haven't eaten breakfast yet. There are still daughters-in-law and grandchildren waiting for my "rice" to go home and cook!" He spread out his hand and looked at the legal tender in his hand, which was already soaked with sweat and pinched into a mess. A skinny young man next to him heard this and went up to the old man and said, "Old father, you should go back, look, we young people can't squeeze in, let alone you?…" The old man glared at him, shook his head, and said: "No, you're hungry! I'm not hungry?" After a while, he sighed, "The poor can only starve to death!"</p>
<p>The trolleybus "dang dang" was ringing, and the streamlined cars were blocked by the crowd. What's the use of the horns honking? "Er'er! What's the matter?" The lady behind asked the driver. "Buying strong rice!" "Hmm! Why didn't you buy more and pile it up at home earlier:…"</p>
<p>The people outside the fence were looking at the people inside the fence, their mouths dripping with envy. In fact, people in the field were rushing forward, squeezing for a long time, unable to see a grain of rice. I looked at your empty basket, and you looked at my cloth bag, making a knowing sigh and bitter smile. A pregnant woman couldn't stand it anymore and shouted: "This is not buying rice, this is called sin!" She said to the patrolman guarding the gate: "I'm not buying it, I want to go out!" But because there were too many people outside, fearing that they would rush in if the door was opened, so they didn't let her out, and she was still yelling….</p>

<h3>Committing the Sin of Abandonment, Creating an Eternal Tragedy</h3>
<p>— (Bai Hua)</p>
<p>There was a time when abandoned infant corpses were frequently discovered on the streets of Shanghai. Some were wrapped in tattered rags, others covered with a newspaper, and some were even left naked on street corners. The Blue Cross burial cart patrolled the roads daily, transporting these children who had nowhere to be buried, to their final resting place. At the same time, the baby receiving boxes at orphanages were ringing non-stop, as many lively and adorable children were abandoned by their unfortunate parents.</p>
<p>Suffering children! Whether alive or dead, they all face the same fate!</p>
<p>There is no parent in the world who does not love their children. During pregnancy, mothers are always mindful of their health, fearing it will affect their future children. After the baby is born, they take care to nurture them, hoping they will grow up soon. Who can bear to send their newborn child to that dark baby receiving box, never knowing who their parents are for the rest of their lives? Even if the child dies unfortunately, who can bear to abandon that pure soul on the street corner?</p>
<p>But the hardships of life compel them to create cruel tragedies. When they place their children in the baby receiving box, with trembling hands pulling the bell cord, do you know that the parents are shedding the most sincere tears in the world? They are murmuring prayers:</p>
<p>"Child! Please forgive your parents for being so heartless, sending you to an unfamiliar world. But child! Rather than starving to death with your unfortunate parents, they will raise you to adulthood, perhaps a kind gentleman will adopt you, ... but you will never know your biological parents!..."</p>
<p>Yes, for the sake of the child's future, it is better to be born separately than to starve to death. As for those who die and are abandoned on the street corner, that is just a matter of conscience. But now, between life and death, there is an even more tragic reality before us. According to reports:</p>
<p>The Tongren Hospital on Avenue Dubail in this city has repeatedly discovered cases of parents deliberately abandoning their children, which is a serious social problem. It is learned that on August 10th of this year, a Xun family claiming to live at No. 25 Da Xi Road sent their four-year-old biological daughter, named Hongxian, to the hospital for treatment. However, after entrusting the child to the hospital, the parents never visited her. More than a month has passed, and after investigation, there is no Xun family at No. 25 Da Xi Road. Tongren Hospital now suspects that the parents deliberately abandoned the child and is preparing to arrange for her full care. However, they still hope that the parents will come to claim the child within two weeks, to complete the bond of flesh and blood (all medical expenses will be waived). Otherwise, the parents will be committing the sin of abandonment and creating an eternal tragedy.</p>
<p>This Xun family did not abandon the child in the beginning, having raised her to the age of four, and then abandoned her in the hospital later. It shows how difficult it was for the parents to raise this child, until they had no way to treat her illness, yet could not bear to let her die when she still had a glimmer of hope, and thus entrusted her life to the hospital. "More than a month has passed, and they have never visited her." Who knows if the parents are hoping day and night for the child's speedy recovery, perhaps even dreaming of a reunion, but instead, creating an eternal tragedy!</p>
<p>In these past two years, how many children have died tragically under bombs and cannons, how many children are receiving enslaved education. Even those children who are fortunate enough to be under the protection of the concession are encountering such tragic fates!</p>
<p>"Creating an eternal tragedy" is a fact, but who would willingly "commit the sin of abandonment"?</p>
<p>Save the children, save the children!</p>
<h3>Reply to Mr. Zhu Zhuocheng</h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>I have recently read "A New Cookbook" and Mr. Zhu Zhuocheng inquired about the amount of water needed when cooking wheat flour and tofu dregs together. I have investigated and found that this food is a emergency measure during extraordinary times. Its preparation method is similar to ordinary pancakes and noodles. If a little baking powder is added, it can also be made into vegetable steamed buns, beef dumplings, and the like. However, the taste is coarser than pure wheat flour. If the tofu dregs can be drained and ground into powder, then the taste will be no different from pure wheat flour.</p>
<p>Sincerely, Gu Zhong</p>

<h3>Electric Light (Anecdotes of Mechanical Poetry)</h3>
<p>— Ru Hui</p>
<p>Here, it is pointed out directly that the reason why electric lights are so bright is that there is nothing mysterious about it, it is simply the effect of "electricity." Presumably, because people knew that it was just the effect of "electricity" and not the effect of any "monster," the order prohibiting the use of electric lights was lifted shortly thereafter. "Illustrated Guide to Famous Scenery of Shanghai" (1884), Picture 49, "Electric Lights Hanging, Bright as a Painting," says:</p>
<p>...Recently, an Englishman named Lide invented electric lights, which are bright and dazzling... Their color is pale white, like the moon in the sky, illuminating everything, showing every detail. At first, the authorities were misled by rumors and issued a ban. Later, they learned that its use was beneficial and harmless, so the ban was lifted. Recently, theaters, teahouses, restaurants, and smoking rooms are all brightly lit, with brilliant lights and vibrant colors, creating a city that never sleeps, without waiting for the fire dragon to spit flames...</p>
<p>The illustration shows a woman in a carriage, lifting the curtain behind the carriage, staring in amazement at the street lamp. The coachman, on the other hand, holds up a paper lantern, adding to the interest. However, it is the poets who are most sensitive. They are not only "amazed" by "electric lights," but also "moved." For example, Cao Kongzhao's "New Yuefu" series, one poem on "Electric Lights": Expelling the air and riding the wind, a garden made into a ball, hanging like a mirror, flowing like stars. Western skills reach perfection, using electricity as light, shining by itself. The writing is resonant and empty, with crystal light shining up and down. Even when the sky is cloudy and dusty, the twilight sways with the color of the toad on the moon. At first, I suspected a banished immortal, coming from the sea to catch the moon, with the Guanghan Palace opening everywhere. I also suspected Marquis Bowang, plucking stars from the sky, filling the mansion with the clear radiance of pearls and jade. Alas, the thunderous whip cracks, striking the drum of the watchtower, not illuminating hunger and cold, but illuminating singing and dancing.</p>
<p>This sentiment is extremely reasonable. Because under the economic conditions at the time, apart from the singing halls and dance pavilions and the homes of the wealthy, who among the common people could afford to install such novel and brilliant lights? ... (End of this section)</p>
