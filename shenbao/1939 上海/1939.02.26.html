<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c14">對於全國敎育會議的期望 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>全國敎育會議將於三月一日在重慶開幕了。當這樣軍書旁午的時候，政府當局居然能夠注意到百年大計的敎育問題，召集全敎會議，從容研討，這種高瞻遠矚的精神，何等值得欽佩！又從這一件事實，更可以充分證明了抗戰的中國，政治已經上了軌道，正向建國路途上邁進，這又何等值得欣慰和興奮！</p>
<p>敎育是不能離開社會的實際需要而孤立的。它和政治關係非常密切，政治上發生何種需耍，敎育就必須而且必然地適應它。抗戰建國過程裏的中國，當然需要抗戰建國的敎育設施。自從八一三前後以至今日，中國的敎育上顯然已有了許多適應實際要求的改革，各項戰時敎育的條例已經頒佈了好幾種；可是還不夠在整個的機構之下，表示一種系統的精神。一切理論的體系必須根據實際行動的經騐而建設起來；這二十個月的抗戰經過，就恰能供給充分的經騐，促進以後長期抗戰建國原則的建立。所以全教會議，在此時開慕，一定能夠吸收過去二十個月的實際經騐，組織成整個的理論體系，作為以後長期行動的設施綱領。我們在幾千里的孤島上，敢預祝全敎會議的美滿成功！</p>
<p>全敎會議將要研討些什麼問題，各代表各專家和政府當局一定有縝密的規劃；但是我們審察國家民族的需要，對於全敎會議却有下列的期望。</p>
<p>第一，在民族至上抗戰第一的中國今日，敎育當然要適應抗戰建國的需要。但所謂抗戰，决不限於軍事動作；所謂建國，尤須經過長期的歷程；因此抗戰建國的敎育，必須具有全面性和長期性的兩種特質。這一次的全敎會議，至少應該完成下列三項工作：一·製定普及敎育的實際方案，促請政府廣泛地切實地推行義務敎育和識字敎育，使全國國民無論老幼，都在最短時期內接受最低限度的敎育，帮助抗戰建國工作的迅速完成。二·整理八一三以來各項戰時敎育的綱領，再彙集各方面貢獻的意見，議定方案，請政府修訂各級學校課程標準，務使適合於抗戰建國的需要和民族抗日聯合戰綫的精神，以前的課程標準雖係各敎育專家心思的結晶品，自有許多俊點，可是事實上顯然還缺乏抗戰建國精神切實的發揮；而且在民二十四五年間「睦隣」令影響之下，學校課程又被迫地褪了些顏色，目前必須補救這種過去的缺憾。三·由於抗戰以來民衆組織不夠健全和漢奸充斥的事實昭示，中國的敎育急須强調民族精神，增加精神訓練的成分，不論民衆敎育或兒童敎育的部門裏，感情陶冶和意志培養，必須與知識的敎授並重，才可以養成中國國民寗可斷頭，不願降敵的普遍而永久的精神。</p>
<p>第一，中國過去的敎育，無論在指導的原則或實施的制度上，都顯示着步調凌亂和模仿外國的情態；根本原因由於中國社會形態的複雜、所以敎育專家往往偏重在沿海沿江都市社會的需要，而忽略了廣大內地的實際情境。這種不切實情的敎育，效率當然不高；允其在目前抗戰建國的非常時期，更難發生什麼積極的作用。此决全敎會議應該認識到這一點，對於一切教育原則或制度上的改進，除了適合抗戰建國的需要以外，更應糾正過去雜亂倣效的病態，建設起中國獨特的敎育體系。目前中國的建設重心已經由沿海沿江移入內地，其中一定有許多實際的問題，可以促進中國敎育的基本建設。</p>
<p>第三，全敎會議應該確立一種游擊區的敎育方案，因爲在廣大的游擊區內，失學的靑年和兄童數量很多，日方和僞組織正乘虛而入，進行其奴化教育的政策，中國方面應該從速規劃一種辦法，以資補救。例如容許游擊區內的靑年和兒童自行在家補習，將來通過某種考試後卽可取得學校畢業的同等資格，但一經進人僞學校讀書的即予剝奪此項權利，這也是一種可能有效的辦法，希望全敎會議能夠注意到的。</p>

<p>匈京　匈牙利外長克薩基今日簽定反共公約、事後克薩基發言、謂匈國之加入此約、不僅爲其二十年對共奮鬬之結果、亦爲匈國對德義日誠摯友誼之表徴、自一九一九年起匈國即從事反抗共產黨在國際事件中之潛勢力、今之反共協定、並不對任何國有所不利、但僅爲一種自衛方法、以防簽約國內政之遭不正當干涉而已、共產黨爲國際性質的、其活動之方法不一、且亦有力、故必國家間合作、始能防止其活動云、駐匈德大使致詞、歡迎匈國之加入反共公約、認此乃匈國與德義日三國關係友好利害共同之表示、匈國在歷史上爲秩序與和平之中堅、今忠實保持其歷史上地位、而加入防遏共產黨破壞工作之奮鬬、殊可欣幸云、（二十四日路透電）</p>

<p>採取何種步驟尙未能明言</p>
<p>字林報二月二十二日東京特的訪員通訊云、日本陸相·海相與外相昨在國會發言後、記者於今日特晤陸軍興海軍兩省發言人、由發言人之言論觀之、關於華人暗殺者近在上海公共租界內之舉動、日本顯然有採取强硬立塲之意、日方是吾將要求以上海外國警務之完全統制權移交彼等、或要求由日本海軍或憲兵司令部代爲維持公共租界全部之秩序、或將加緊控制出入兩租界之一切華人、似尚未决定、陸·海·外三省刻正</p>
<p>進行會議、考慮上海日當局所提之主張、預料旦夕將商定决議、據海軍省代理發言人水野大佐語記者云、上海公共租界工部局及其警務處遏止此等兇案、苟非不具誠意、即屬無力出此、二者必居其一、日本舉國對此極爲憤懣、彼等對甚至在白畫作此等卑怯工作之罪犯、尚未捕獲一人、到處駐有警務人員、而不能較易的捕獲此等罪犯、幾不能置信、允有進者、於日方向工部局一再要求取充量戒備、以防杜此等罪行之際、暴舉竟繼續發生、苟工部局及其警務處咸無能力、則須交他人控制大勢、不能任令長如今日之情形、而必取强硬之步驟云，記者詢</p>
<p>强硬行動、是吾即日本海軍陸戰隊或將代起統治公共租界其餘部份、即蘇州河南岸之謂、發言人答、渠雖不能確切答覆之、但或有此可能、復稱、此等罪案、大半確在公共租界內發生、但暗殺者或避於法租界，此點目前吾人尚未確知、但確悉、甚至往昔承平時期、法租界乃陰謀者暗殺者與政洽犯之淵藪、彼等自全中國各部前往、而匿跡其中云、復據陸軍省代理發言人秋山少佐今日午後語記者云、有名華人連續遭暗殺後，今上海公共租界似有不能任其繼續之不可能的局勢存在、至於將取</p>
<p>何種決定之步驟、五口人今不能言之但陸軍省代表今正與海軍及外務兩省代表商談中、在最近之將來或一二日內可望决定若干行動之方針云、關於日本陸軍飛機昨晨十時在深圳附近九龍租借地界綫內英境意外轟炸事、秋山少佐稱、陸軍省對此錯誤、業已囑香港日總領事轉向香港當局道歉矣、自日軍進佔廣州後、已得利用珠江以供運輸、故該區巳無特殊用途、業經放棄、但華方游擊隊開始利用其昆連英境而集於駭區、因此日陸軍决定此乃轟炸彼等、而使離去之時矣、轟炸時一彈偶墜英境擊中機車一輛、致傷人若于、渠預料此等損害、於相當時期內、將</p>

<p>對暗殺者表示同情之城市爲甚、惟日人衷心或覺公共租界警務處不能任咎、但日本之輿論或迫使彼等取魯莽而激烈之步驟、且彼等或亦自知此種步驟毫無意義、而反有損於己也、若日方果採取此等步驟、則全市居民將受重大損失、允以華人爲最、如行兇者研究被害者之習慣、而被害者</p>
<p>不知防備仍在行兇者前露面、則此種暗殺案、即無從防杜、蓋每日於同時間乘坐人力車經同一道路而被殺者、已達三人矣、被殺後從事偵查、實屬徒勞、如屬普通暗殺案或可向嫌疑犯調查兇案動機、而警務處之推測、十之六七、但遇政治暗殺案、則嫌疑犯之範國廣大、蓋上海無數華人中、任何人或均有鼓勵作此舉之動機也、該警務人員之作此言、乃根據來自揚子江下游游擊區內之</p>
<p>可靠消息謂該區日必發生政治暗殺案、暗殺者在無錫允爲活躍、聞該城平均每日發生暗殺案五起、日軍不時緊閉城門、挨戶搜查、但次日暗殺者復活躍矣、盛傳蘇州河北岸公共租界內亦發生政治暗殺案數起、但未能證實、</p>

<p>日機飛浙投彈及偵察</p>
<p>海門存鹽已運至後方</p>
<p>自日艦企圖浙東海門登陸失敗後、竟將椒江封鎖、妨害外輪航行、海門口外、仍有日艦巡弋、日機飛浙東各地偵察及投彈、浙東形勢、依然緊張、中國軍隊戒備、益見嚴密、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>椒江封鎖　日艦弋巡</p>
<p>日艦已將海門之椒江封鎖綫外、另以砂石帆船沉沒、建成一封鎖錢、並標有竹竿等記號、今竹竿等訊號、雖已爲我軍所炸毀、但椒江之通航、短期內决難實現、前日德商飛康輪由溫抵滬、當經過椒江口外時、遙見日艦兩艘巡弋、至於定海·樂淸·普陀、等洋面、時發現日艦巡弋、所以浙東形勢、依然嚴重、</p>
<p>日機飛浙偵察投彈</p>
<p>日機時飛浙東各地偵察及投彈、二十二日晨、日機五架、飛入鎭海之招寶山、投彈三枚、炸毀房屋一間、並在定海島投彈一枚、但無損失、昨日日機六架、飛浙東諸暨·金華·寗波·一帶偵察、自二月十八日起、日機時飛浙東各地、所投之彈、什九均落於荒地、故浙東並無重大損失、浙東之空襲警報設備、益臻完備、</p>
<p>海門存鹽運至後方</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向航業界探悉、日艦此次企圖在海門登陸、聞係得漢奸報吿、該地有食鹽待裝輪運至海防、自登陸失敗之後、即封鎖椒江、阻止食鹽裝輪出口、但該項食鹽、我方早已由海門運至後方某地、目前海門無食鹽、况海門並非產鹽之地、至於海門之戒備、依然森嚴、防止日艦之再行登陸、</p>
<p>浙東沿海戒備森嚴</p>
<p>浙東沿海寗波·海等地、以及椒江·甬江·甌江·等、早已由第十集團軍劉總司令命令溫台·寗波·兩防守司令、佈置防禦工程、調派重兵駐紮、爲維持土貨出口起見、暫准寗波·溫州·兩口岸通航、自海門事件發生後、爲防止漢奸混入內地、對外輪之進口、必須先泊江心、受軍警嚴密檢查後、方准靠岸、</p>

<p>暗殺事件乃必然之結果</p>
<p>爭土械鬥絕無政治性質</p>
<p>大陸報云、西區恐怖案件猖獗、已有僞警·暗探·與其他暴徒若干人喪生、但與日方所宣稱者相反、此等案件、並無政治性、昨（二十四日）據本埠警務界聲稱、此等暗殺案、乃西區界外馬路旁發展之必然結果、西區「罪惡地帶一、近迭起</p>
<p>暴徒械鬥</p>
<p>可爲明證、本月份上半月中界外馬路區曾新開土行十六家、彼等均向「上海市府一之日籍顧問興管理尚未完成的雅片專賣之負責人員申請登記、就目前所知、尚未照准、故此等土行、不能向其他方面獲得「黑貨」、只得求諸</p>
<p>私運雅片者、關於此節、土行公會主仟某華人（其姓名此處不予透露爲妙）曾於一月中旬與偽「上海市府」日籍顧問訂定一注交易、雙方同意、苟公會（該會在極司非而路存德坊（譯音）十九號）每月至少購買價值十萬元之雅片、歷三閱月、則日籍顧問願以雅片供給之、公會主任、則允以此項雅片分售與各土行、但渠不以在西區獲得此</p>
<p>獨佔權利爲滿足、且對非公會會員之土行、概不售予雅片、西區十八家土行僅十三家爲公會會員、故所餘五家、無貨應求、只得購買私運之雅片、但該主任不仟私運者侵入其範圍中、乃於土行公會僱用十人、組織暗探團、圖遏制「私」賣雅片、彼等追逐彌亟、私運者之私運方法、彌見狡黠、先則鬥智、繼乃動武、公會暗探團備武器後、私運者之一即</p>
<p>亦備武器故過去雙方不時有發生械鬥之虞、至今亦然、雙方各有其購買雅片之顧客、故互妬益甚、又據消息靈通各界稱、甚至僞警數名被殺、亦無政治性質、彼等今益感此等所謂、「政治謀殺」者、大半應歸咎於毒物買賣</p>

<h3 id="c122">糧食　粉廠趕工製造　期粉較爲遷就　麥市點綴而已 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>粉市並無特殊變化、因值週末之期、客幫進胃動而不暢、連日南北兩幫成交各牌粉達廿萬包、均須陸續運裝、各廠爲適應紅盤、紛紛趕工製造、以資供給、聞本街方面、新年中銷量亦殊不惡、老車牌零批連車力價須四元八角零五釐、每包零售現鈔四元六角五分、又聞廠方對客幫期紛、料爲遷就、對本街售意則甚堅、昨市本街成交約計七八千包、冀魯福汕幫成交約三萬包、市面尚在醞釀中、昨有粉四萬一千包運汕頭、</p>
<p>麥市交易、續見平淡、前日紅盤衹開出三千包、昨市僅開四百包、蓋緣目下各廠原料、旣有洋麥運到、本麥需要、當然不旺、而貨主則以成本高昂、現貨缺乏、售價一味扳持、致雙方成交寥寥、僅能點綴市面而已、統市售開、揚州南京麥兩種、額僅四百包、悉由阜豐廠辦去、福新廠昨無收辦、市面已入平庸、</p>

<p>昨日國米來源、河下衹到四號、車運來者有三千餘包、銷塲初市頗懈、衹有本街稍動、至晚經囤戶採辦、市面乃由疲轉緊、結果各貨呈平疲不一之局、厚粳北幫回起角許、南幫無甚上落、薄稻特別貨去路較旺、亦屬挺秀、中關者則疲軟幾分、杜洋尖埠尖貨稀、亦好數分至一角、變元價格升高、去路稍减、轉呈平定耳、</p>

<p>昨客秈到頭甚稀、而店囤行號已經開始問津、貨主因成本高昂與產價不低、均堅持不肯輕脫、故全日成交不逾二千包、而行情則續漲角外、南京高秈開十一元半、蕪秈十一元一角、新到之泰　興機秈亦開至十一元二角半、目下滬地存底雖充、然搬運頗獲利、而杭甬與各路客幫均有需要、因此行囤方面心思更爲望好云、</p>

<p>金山枝昨香港莊號首市曾有開出、上檔元枝爲六十二元二角、扁枝六十三元許、以次略减、糯米枝開一百五十三元、陳海南肉四十三元、新貨以還價離譜、未成交、然查存底單薄、脚地甚堅、如需要不絕、則後市上展、確有可能、</p>
<p>蘭谿白蓮、到存不多、市勢堅挺、昨有小數開出、色澤較佳者爲一百元、次之九十七元、湘蓮有客貨一批、由掮客代售、行方還價尚差四五元、未成、</p>

<p>建築材料、國產居多、惟五金一項、外貨頗占重要地位、茲以外匯緊縮、定價提高、人心看好、不免囤積居奇、故今春紅盤、均見上漲、洋松雖屬外貨、但爲本松及杉木牽制、價格不無爲所壓低云、</p>

<p>白煤生意、因火爐用途减色、銷路未免見遜、故新年紅盤、鴻基白煤、每噸爲四十五元不動、不意第二日上市、因初次到貨不多、買方銳意貪辦、新貨二千餘噸、不够應銷、貨主乃乘機抬高價格、計開鴻基中塊每噸四十七元、篩塊四十九元、拷塊五十一元、同行洋經浜　車、送到另加行槓、</p>

<p>日來麩皮市况猶似失舵之舟、人心徬徨、雖係高人操縱慣技、然以華制華之下策、終成泡影、昨之氣象略形鬆弛、蓋關島市回跌、公司有動搖之象、昨市塲中衹有回籠阜豐華豐小包舊棧單四千包成交、價爲三元二角、比前市趨升二分半、今日有麩皮一千包運汕頭、</p>

<p>五金花色、自紅盤步步高升後、兼之本埠各廠家開工與未開工者各半、故銷路殊稀、惟容幫銷路獨旺、如天津幫烟台幫及靑島幫皆有大批採去、其花色如二十六號大馬口鐵每箱沽一百二三十元不等、聞去達百餘箱之多、其他如新鋼板·新鉛絲·三角鐵·黑鐵皮·平白鐵·元釘、及新老鋼廠美會司鐵等、均有不少辦去、價與紅唇相仿、</p>

<p>昨日絲市、漲風仍在邁進中、洋行白廠七八分售開一七二〇元、並未視爲良價、用戶普通白廠、如TH牌等、已售開一〇〇〇元、輯里經、蟒蛇正牌價一〇二〇元、預測市氣、將益上進、今據洋商絲公會之統計、二月份上半期之白廠R字七八分平均價、已較一月份上平期飛漲二八〇元、（按一月份十五號前價一三〇〇元、二月十五號前價一五八〇元）、自二月十五號至最近十日間、該等級之白廠、則又飛漲一四〇元已、如此漲風、堪稱空前、輯里經XA級漲率、已頗驚人、一月上半期價八一〇元、二月上半期價九二〇一〇元、二月上半期價九二〇元、截至目前售開行盤、則又飛漲一〇〇元之譜矣、</p>
<p>昨海外絲市、大勢仍屬堅穩、日美交易所行市、雖略形回小、但實銷市價、紐約均開原盤、里昂則一致上漲、本埠絲銷方面、計洋行白廠做開五十担、印莊土絲做開二十担、用戶做開二十五担、市價均較前緊挺、蓋買賣雙方、仍認此等交易爲紅盤也、</p>

<p>東疋略形穩定</p>
<p>國布客銷稀少、市勢疲弱、蓋以本外埠布號去歲均獲厚利、資金充裕、貨底儲積較前倍增、不免浮於賽需、兼以紅盤時浙東吿警、溫甬帮隔歲預定各貨、均留滬未願裝往、昨川滇又以海防貨棧擁擠、亦停止辦貨、惟汕·港·廣州灣·閩海各口均屬暢通、購辦尙零星耳、北路津帮辦條素府綢·綫呢·藍布·漂布·印花布近二百箱、本街門市批發號、以去歲營業順利、日來紅盤擇應令貨品、均有點綴、達豐·恒豐·中央·綸昌·等廠印花深色及白地色丁克羅綢花布成交二百數十箱、贛帮辦大鵬等牌細布·漂布·印花布四五十件、市價較紅盤白貨細布·細斜均落一二角、色布整理貨亦降一角至三角不等、惟印花貨較堅、白地色丁缺貨、綸昌花布漲五分、直貢緞漲二角、金價猛漲、布疋製造成木增高、故一般人心仍屬看好、</p>
<p>東布昨日白貨市氣略形隱定、在實銷方面、雖仍呆滯、而行廠期貨堅持不鬆、大戶字號依然看好、散戶放空力薄、故細布細斜之售盤、稍轉挺秀、細布喊高每疋二分半至五分、細斜無榮辱而已、趨於平穩之途、本街零星客戶、辦進現貨的四百餘件、</p>

<p>— 黃式金</p>
<p>（二）在職中學教師之現狀</p>
<p>我國中等學校教師之現狀、究竟怎樣、已有數位加以調查、據童潤之先生所述、過去全國的教師受過專業訓練的衹有百分之十五、在十個教師當中竟有八個不懂教育爲何物的、還有三個是以中學教育程度而教中等學校學生的、浙江省的教育是素稱發達的、但根據該省二十年度的統計全省中等學校師資亦頗不健全、受過師範大學及高等師范畢業的、合計衹有百分之一〇·四四、又民國二十四年鄭西谷先生受中國教育學會之托研究中學師資訓練問題、據其所編統計、現在中等學校之師資、大學畢業者佔全數百分之四〇·二八、專門學校畢業者佔百分之一四·一一、高等師範或專修科畢業者佔百分之二·九九、國內師范大學或教育學院畢業者佔百分之一一·三五、留學外國得有學位者佔百分之五·〇二、從以上的數字看來、我們可以知道我國現任的中等學校師資　是大都資格不符、缺乏專業訓練的、</p>
<p>有人分析社會上各種職業、以「人」爲工作對象的專門職業署衹有四種、一是醫師、二是律師、三是牧師、四是教師、醫師的工作在救護人命、律師的工作在保障人權、牧師的工作在培植人雲、教師的工作在改良人生、擔任道四種工作的人都須受過專業的訓練、始能有所成就、在歐美各國對於這四種專業者的訓練資格、及地們都是十分重社的、我國與論對於開錯了藥方的醫師、和斷錯了法案的律師、都爲社會所不容、但對於誤導靑年人生的教師反而不加注意、實在太忽略了、難道疾病的療治、須要請專業的醫師、法律的判决、須要請專業的律師、而人格的陶冶、思想的訓練、就不需要專業的教師嗎、這可顯示我們輕重倒置、將身體看了比品性更爲要緊、將財產　看了比人格尤其寶貴、我們應當知道現代的教師與古時不同、自從近代政治組織進化、國家已負起了教育的責任、同時教育已被視爲貫澈國家政策的工具、復興民族的途徑了、因此、現代的教師不是任何受過一點普通教育的人都可以棄任的了、鄭氏調查四十六位中學校長的意見、指出現任教師的弱點很多、如在（甲）知識方面、（一）缺乏專門學識之修養、（二）教育學識之修養、（三）所教非所學不能澈底了解所教學科等、（乙）技能方面、（一）缺乏教學技能之訓練、（二）徒知教書本不諳學習指導、（三）缺乏管理技能不能維持教室秩序、缺乏工藝技能不能自製教具等、（丙）理想方面、（一）缺乏責任心、（二）缺乏合作精神、（三）言行不一不能以身作則、（四）只求敷衍不負訓育責任、（五）缺乏教育信念及終身爲教育之决心等、（丁）其他方面、（一）缺乏健全體格、（二）缺乏正當好尚等、由此可知、我國在職中學教師的現狀、是不能使人滿意的、（未完）</p>

<p>兒童週刋人不可以無恥  君朋　　羞恥，每個人都應該有的，換句話說：「人不可以無恥。」　　小朋友！羞恥兩個字，對於我們的「品行」很有關係的，是連繫的，不可分離的。你看！有一個人，家裏窮得沒有飯吃，那末不是要餓死嗎？難道束手待斃嗎？於是想到隔壁的某富翁家去偷錢，如果偸到了錢，就可以生活下去了，但是給人家拿住，便要送到官裏去吃官司。再有人的了幾夥同伴，想做强盜的勾當，但是一旦給官裏捉住，不消說，要判無期徒刑，甚且還要槍斃！小朋友！你想可怕嗎？他爲什麼要做賊？他爲什麼要做强盜？果然是爲了生存，可惜他走錯生活之路，一方面是社會的病態，由失業而走險；一方面大多是利令智昏，忘記了「羞恥。」　　你們在學校裏，關於品行方面，一定是很注意的，並且是很嚴厲的。但是在地上拾到了東西，有沒有還給人家？對於同學，有沒有說過謊話？是不是忠誠？功課方面，是不是努力？還是不用心？看見人家的柬西，有沒有偸過？這許多反省的話，必須天天向自己責問，良心上受到的責罰，是頂痛苦的。小朋友！我們如果偸了人家的東西，是賊骨頭，說了謊話，是自欺欺人，讀書不用心，是對不起師長，對不起父母，也對不起自己。我們要知道，强盜和賊是不能做的，就是沒有法律制裁，我們的人格何在？人格是第二個生命，並且要比生命重大，因爲有一句格言：「一失足成千古恨，再回頭巳百年身」！深切去體騐吧！鴨蛋殼做兎子燈  新生　　一到了春節假期小朋友們少不得要隨着爸爸媽媽們上街去逛逛，有一般的小弟弟小妹妹，受了那五色鮮艷的紙糊燈彩的吸引，少不得又嚷着要買：而結果總是一筆消費　　這兒我來敎小朋友們製作蛋殼燈的方法，我想你們一定有工夫來做些玩玩的，自己旣可藉此練習手工，做成後又可以送給弟妹們玩，這樣一舉兩得的工作，你們又何樂而不爲呢？　　製作的主要材料，當然是鴨蛋殼，將鴨蛋在側面（中部）開孔，用剪子修齊（附圖一）這便是兔子的軀幹部份。兔子頭部的做法分兩種：附圖二是立體的；附圖三是單片的，須將兩面粘合而後依虛綫將其粘於蛋殼上的。附圖二，三兔耳，眼等均係繪在原張紙上者，若將兩耳另剪而再粘貼於頭頂部，更以細短之竹絲穿過其眼部，而以浸漲之黃豆兩粒穿於竹絲兩端，再用紅墨水將荳染紅，其頭部的形狀更爲生動，免子的尾巴係一小塊棉花，用膠水粘在蛋殼的另一端的。　　在兔子全身製成後，我們即可配製燈了，燈的式樣分二種：一種是提掛式（附圖四），在蛋殼開孔的周圍鑽挖小洞四個，而以細銅絲四根繫縛之，如此即可懸掛了，若欲提持的話，則另備一枝竹杆，將銅絲縛在竹杆頭即成。另一種是牽曳式的（附圖五），用硬紙糊成一隻較火柴匣蕊略大的長方形紙匣，以細竹杆兩根前後並行地貫穿匣側，以作輪軸，再用木質之廢棋子四枚，各在中央鑽一小孔，而將其揷於竹杆兩端，卽成一輛備有兩對車輪之小車，然後將已製就之兔身膠於車之內面，再在車之前端裝一小環圈，以便繫綫牽曳。　　兔燈可染繪各種色彩，五顏六色，鮮艷最宜注重，因係玩具，不必顧及它自然之體色。燈內的燈火裝置甚簡，只須覓一盛油膏之鐵皮小圓盆，再剪一圓形鐵皮，而以棉綫作燈蕊；盒中盛豆油少許，以作燃料。這油燈即置放在蛋殼裏面。（如附圖六）　　由上面的兔子燈我們還可以做成：金魚燈，鴨子燈，飛　燈和汽中燈，金魚燈的前端應裝成兩隻突出的眼珠，此外冉裝一畫紙剪成之星　，及一對軟紙質之胸　，腹，臀，背緒等可省去之：鴨燈的頭尾可參照兔燈的製法；飛機燈的機要用硬紙膠於蛋殼上即成；以上三種是提掛式的，末一種汽車燈則係牽曳式，其製法較兔燈更簡，祇須在其前端裝以車燈兩盞，中部再裝一車窗便可吿成。以上各種蛋壳燈的色彩，可隨自己設施，但須注意其前後重量之平均與吾，我想小朋友們一定還會化出別種更好玩的蛋殼燈來！過塘行中（下）  白正　　那行中的經理和李先生是同鄉，他們倆談着安徽話，明兒聽得莫明其妙，他們講了好一會兒。後來李先生和明兒的父親說：「最近幾天這裏風聲很緊，在錢塘江裏的船，都被捉去作軍用，而且船價飛漲，差不多要照平時加上一倍以上，因爲那些船夫很膽小，不敢到這裏來。我還托他替我們想個辦法。」　　行中出進的人沒有一刻兒停止過，有的扛着大包出去的，有的掮着束西進來的，而那些行員手中拿一串竹籤，給每個出去的脚夫一根籤，明兒想上去一定是每根竹籤是每决的代價，他在旁邊默默的看着。　　李先生呌經理預備他們的夜飯，沒有一刻兒，桌上放上了滿滿的四碗菜，兩葷兩素，明兒的肚子早已餓得很了，而在小船上從沒有這樣的豐美，因此他毫不客氣的先坐了下來，一時他嘴裏的饞涎快要從嘴角旁滑下來，然而他忍住着。那晚他吃了一個暢快。　　明兒的父親和張李兩先生出去探聽這幾天來的戰事，明兒也跟隨着他父親一同去了。在一家雜貨店中有一架無綫電，正在播送戰事的消息，他們一夥兒站着聽着，費了十多分鐘之久，這戰事的消息還使他們不十分的失望。他們便很快的回到行中，很希望今晚能呌到船而離開這裏，因爲這裏是不可久留的。做一個小無綫電家（三）  奚人　　（二）認識零件　　「那麼儲電器有什麼用呢」？王民問。「儲電器的用處，是用來藏電的，所以呌做電容，電容的意思就是可以把電容積起來」。他的堂哥頓了一頓又說，「儲電器可分兩種，一種是不能動的，呌做固定儲電器。（見上期圖一）一種是可以動的，叫做活動儲電器」。　　「那麼儲電器的式樣就是這兩種嗎」？王民很快的接着他堂哥的話就問。　　「不，儲電器的式樣還不止這兩種。活動式的還有三連式的與四連式的，就是用三隻活動式的儲電器或四隻儲電器連在一起　成一隻儲電器」。他的堂哥摸出手帕揩一下鼻頭，再繼續着說，「但是這種儲電器，都要在大的無綫電　裏纔用得到，我們慢慢再講。哦，我忘了吿訴你，這種儲電器在無綫電店家都　　到。但是店裏的人，都呌它做「康特笙」，只要你說「康特笙」，他們就會拿儲電器給你」。　　說了一大簡話，王民一句話也不說。他堂哥回頭望他，只見他張開了口，呆呆地聽得出神了，不禁好笑起來說，「喂，民弟，你在做什麼啊」？　　「喔哥哥，我在聽你講啊」　王民很快樂地說，「關於儲電器，我已經知道一點了，我想下午你再敎我……」王民還沒有講完，他的母親巳來呌他們吃午飯。他的堂哥就說，「吃飯去吧，下午再來換一樣講」。　　王民媽因爲王民的堂哥是難得來的，所以做了很多的菜。王民因爲心裏只記着堂哥講無綫電，沒吃滿一碗飯，就跑回廂房裹去。獨自先拿起各種東西夾看，但是什麼也不懂，只看見各式各樣的東西放滿了一檯子。　　他無意中拿起一樣圓圓的兩頭尖的東西（見圖二A），他正在看的時候，他的堂哥跑進來了，他就跑上前去問他的堂哥說，「哥哥，這個呌什麼」？　　他的堂哥拿起王民手中的東西看了一看說，「哦是這個嗎，呌做礦石，你不是聽見過有礦石機的嗎？礦石機就非用到這個不可的」。他的堂哥把兩頭尖的東西放在　子上，又在一邊拿起像圖二B樣的東西，繼續着說，「礦石也有好幾種，剛才看的呌固定礦石」，他的堂哥揚了一揚手中拿着的東西說，「這呌做活動礦石，但是活動礦石有兩種，一種是用玻璃罩起來的（見圖二C）。」他的堂哥講到這裏，他的目光看到了一個用綫一樣的東西繞起來的東西，指着給王民說，「這個你知道呌什麼」？　　王民回說，「不知道」。　　他的堂哥就說，「道呌做綫圈，在收音機裏是最要緊的。綫圈分二種：一種是用像蛛網樣的紙板繞成的，呌蛛網板錢圈；另一種是用圓筒繞成的，呌圓筒式綫圈」。（見圖三）他的堂哥在這裹頓了一頓，又接着說：「現在。關於一隻簡便收音機的另件差不多都講完了，只有一隻聽筒還沒有講過。聽筒，就是套在耳朶上的有兩隻黑色圓的東西（見圖四）」。泥的故事  愛蓮　　在小河的岸邊，有一把平常的，粗糙而笨重的泥土，它雖是這樣的平常，但時常幻想着它那偉大的價値，終有一個機會，被人發見在這奇妙的世界上。　　最初，在陽春溫和的日光下，草木漸漸地蘇醒了，透出它們的花和葉，互相竊竊地談及它們將來的光榮。樹林也生長在美麗得如千萬小紅寶石和綠翡翠點綴在輕蕩的雲片問的大地上。鮮艷的花朶，使人震驚般的欣喜，當它們被徐來的和風撫愛時，便垂下了頸和伊的姊妹們私語着：「你是這樣的可愛，使這日子也光明燦爛了」。　　蜿蜓的河流，也歡喜樂得合着節拍，撞擊在岸灘邊，發出了音樂美的聲調，訴說它們由氷的封鎖中掙得了自由，有了新的活力從雪山上瀉下來，激動了在磨坊中的水輪，幹出偉大的工作，更使那龐大的輪船漂流在茫無涯際的洋海面上　　在那時候，泥土在岸邊呆呆地等候它的機會，而自慰着它將有可貴的前途。「我的機會將來了」，它自言自語着。「我是不會永世埋沒的。在這一季中，榮譽，美麗和稱頌，無疑的是屬於我的了」。　　有一天，泥土覺得在它目己下面有一個扁乎的鐵鏟，從在它等待了好久的地方抬舉起來，拋擲到有另外一堆泥土的車裏。那車便帶着它去了。經過了崎嶇不平的山路，挨受了不少的顚頓，但它一些也不怕，反鼓勵着自己：「這是必須的。上光榮的路一定是有顚沛的。現在我是在貢獻給世界的路上了」。　　這行程雖是困苦的，但再也沒有比這件事更痛苦的隨着來了。它是被放在一隻狹長的槽裏，把它混和，敲擊；攪拌和踐踏，這幾乎使它不可再忍受的。但它充滿了熱望－必須經過了這一番的艱苦，才有一優美而可貴的結果，因此在它精神上受到了莫大的安慰。於是它深深地等待着，更一心以爲完滿的結果是爲了它預備的　　於是它被放在一座輕鬆的旋輪上轉動，它憂慮這樣快的急轉，恐怕自己的身體要分裂成幾千塊。再有一大力的壓迫和模型加在它身上又經一急轉，那時它感覺得一陣子的眩暈和痛苦，便成了另一個的模樣了。　　有一隻不知誰的手放它在爐子裏，這火是這樣的在炙－可怕和銳利－比了在炎夏的岸邊還要熱得厲害。經過了這一切的艱苦，它能這樣的忍耐着，因爲信任它自己一定有偉大的將來。「當然」，它想，「我願吃苦，而只要我成爲華麗的物品。或者我是禮拜堂裏的裝飾品，或是在皇帝面前珍貴的花瓶」。　　後來這烘燒的過程也完了。它從爐裹拿出來，放在木板上。它眼見得蔚藍的天空，在這凉快的空氣中，它覺得滿身的舒適。啊！苦難吃盡了！光榮是近在眼前了！　　在木板的旁邊，有一個不十分淸澈的池，但靜止得能反照出影子來。起先，當它被拿起來時，它從池中瞧見自已的新模樣－這是忍耐和吃苦的酬報，它的期望是實現了－一隻普通的花瓶，硬而直的，紅而醜的。它覺得自己是不會陳列在皇帝的御府裏和藝術的宮中了，因爲它被製造得這樣的不美麗，深深地不滿意，埋怨着它的製造者：「爲什麼你把我製成這樣兒」？　　它是很憂鬱的不快了好多日子。到後來，它覺得裏面充滿了泥土，更有一棕色而粗糙，死一般的東西放在泥土中，它預備抵抗這新來的恥辱。「我滿肚子汚穢的廢物，這顯然對我是不利的，我是無疑的失敗了」。　　但是現在它是放在花房裏，那邊有陽光溫和的撫摩，淸水的灌溉。它天天等着機會。忽然它覺得在它肚子裏的那一東西在活動－這是簇新的希望。但它一直無知無覺，不明白這新希望的意義。　　有一天，它又被舉起來，帶到一座莊嚴的禮拜堂中去。它的期望確實的來了。它在世界中佔一良好的地位。光榮的音樂奏演了。許多鮮花環繞着它，竟使它莫名其妙，輕輕地對它附近的一個花瓶問道：「他們爲什麼放我在這裹？爲什麼有許多人對着我們看」？那花瓶回答道：「你還不知道嗎？你的肚中帶來了皇上珍貴的百合花，它那雪白的花瓣，金黃的花心。這許多人對着它們看，因爲它們是世界中最奇異的。它們的根是在你的肚中，你也是何等的榮耀呀」！　　最後，這泥土是大大的滿意了，深深地感謝它的製造者，因爲它雖是一隻泥製的花瓶，可是它肚中巳獲得了這樣偉大的寶物。　　特別啟事　本刋因積稿如山，用不勝用，兩個月內，停止收稿，請投稿諸君千萬注意。小朋友的小園地救國  斯盛小學五年級生　徐文煒　　古人說：「國以民立，民以國存。」所以一個國家的人民，非愛他的國不可。　　一個人民，怎樣才有愛國的表現呢，舉例如下：　　（一）要有良好的智識：怎樣才有良好的智識呢？那一定要靠求學，在求學以外，還要多看有益的書，做我們智識方面的補充，不懂的地方，儘可提出來，問我們的老師或朋友，道樣，我們學業史可進步了。　　（二）要有健全的身體：怎樣才能有健全的身體呢？那就要靠運動，例如賽跑，踢球……等都是。　　現在我們的祖國眞在生死仔亡的關頭，全國人民都應有臥薪嘗膽的精神，無論在什麼時候，都不忘記救國，這樣，我們中華民國，可以永久立於世界，不致有滅亡的危險了。值得回憶的一頁  比華小學六年級生　史濟侖　　在暖和的陽光下的一個弄口，一羣小朋友在做各種遊戲，嘻嘻哈哈，玩得非常有趣。更有幾個坐在搖床裏的嬰孩，也伊呀呀地在附和着，這是寒假期中小朋友每天遊戲的塲所。　　有一天，我也夾雜在此中和人下棋，正玩得高興的時候，忽然來了幾個黃髮綠眼的俄童，他們到了這充滿着快樂的頴村弄口，停了一會，却跑進來擾亂我們的樂園，幾個年幼的小朋友，眼縫中淌着淚珠，哭着回家，原來給這幾個强暴者欺侮了。我們幾個年長的小朋友，看見伙伴無故受辱，我們就亳不猶豫的起來和他們反抗。　　一剎那，我們就開始和他們肉搏，我們的人多，他們的人大，就各不相讓的大打起來。　我們的團結，我們的勇敢，終於把他們驅走了，我們獲得了勝利，弄口已不見了俄童的影了，於是快樂的景象，又恢復了過來。可惡的狸貓  民啟小學六年級生　李蘭珍　　我家的狸貓眞頑皮，他不好好地在家裏捉老鼠，却整天的在外面玩着，有一天他捉了一隻小雀子給我看，那小雀子的翅膀塌下了，頭低垂着，胸前有一道傷痕，那鮮紅的熱血正在流出來。　　看到這裏，我的眼淚像潮水般的滾下來，接着我想一隻能飛，能唱，活潑的小雀子，到此便不能再飛再唱了，唉，多麼可憐啊！　　我看到了那貓這樣的殘忍，忍不住罵他幾聲可惡，可是我回憶到一般靠了權勢的惡人，去壓迫那些弱小的人們，我們又將怎樣對待他們呢？兒童周刊的自述  前峻德小學四年級生　林志濤　　我的名字呌做兒童周刋，住在申報中，每逢星期日，和我的小朋友們晤面一决。每决我總把有趣味的故事，和文章獻給小朋友們欣賞。我的性情，是喜歡廣交朋友：不論貧富，凡是兒童，我都願意和他們做朋友，從來不驕傲，也不鄙視人家，有時小朋友們把意見交給我，我總是替他們發表出來，去貢獻給各地的小朋友，所以極受小朋友們的喜歡，而稱讚我是一個好朋友。白雪公主（八）  天孫　　於是那七矮人做了個鬼臉，一個個都縮頭縮腦的躱了起來。　　白雪公主醒回來之後，便把那一雙小小的手，擦了擦倦眼，從牀上霍地坐了起來。伊是一個十分伶俐的孩子，早就聽得那七矮人嘰嘰咕咕的低語聲了。當下伊自言自語的道：「孩子們一定是回到家裏來了。」　　伊張眼瞧時，先還不見有甚麼人，心中暗暗稱怪。但那七矮人因爲好奇心重之故，躱在那裏冉也打煞不住了，緩緩地站起身來，白雪公主何等眼快，早一眼望見了那七頂奇形怪狀的尖帽子了。一時十四隻小圓眼睛，都在向着伊張望；接着伊又瞧見了七個紅紅的鼻子，七張張開着的大嘴，下面垂着一排長長的白鬚子。　　白雪公主很高興的招呼他們道：「你們各位可好啊？」　　老頑固咆哮似的答道：「有甚麼好不好！」　　白雪公主　了這句不客氣的回話，並不生氣，只笑了一笑。他那執拗粗暴的老臉龐，就使伊想起那牀架上所刻着七個有趣的名兒來。伊不知不覺的脫口呼道：「呀！你一定是頑固了！」　　老頭固滿面含怒，好像在風潮發作以前的天色一般，滿佈着黑雲；兩眼中也放着怒光，對人瞧着，可是其餘的六矮人却放聲笑了。　　白雪公主又對他們說道：「你們現在不必對我說明，我定能猜到你們呌甚麼名字！不信，我來試一試，保管是不會錯的。」　　伊對博士瞧了一眼，見他的眼鏡後面，堆着一臉的笑，便肯定的說道：「我想你一定是博士，可對不對？」　　博士囁嚅着道：「我麼？呃－你說－正是我！　　好啊，好啊！」　　白雪公主很溫柔的說道：「謝謝你！」伊的那雙俏眼，掃來掃去，掃到了頑固隔壁的一個矮漢子身上，却見他連頭帶臉全都漲紅了。　　伊很得意的喊道：「哼哼，我猜着了，你一定是怕羞！」　　怕羞吐了口氣道：「咦，又猜着了！」他心中不但佩服這天上安琪兒　的女孩子生得非常美麗，一面也佩服伊的伶俐聰明。　　這時貪睡恰好　了個呵欠，不用說，白雪公主一猜就猜中了。噴嚏偏又仲着鼻子，不住的亂嗅，並且把他的手指放在鼻孔下面，像要打出噴嚏來了。　　白雪公主笑道：你不用對我說，我已知道你是噴嚏了！」　　噴嚏接口道：「我樂於遇見你－啊－咀……」打了一個長長的噴嚏。　　快樂跳了起來，他再也不能熬着不開口了，忙向白雪公主給自己介紹道：「小姐，我是快樂。」又指了指啞吧道：「這一個是啞吧！」　　啞吧開。不得，只是搖動着他的耳朶，一面向白雪公生呆瞧着。　　快樂忙給他說明道：小姐，他是一句話也不會說的。」　　白雪公主很憐惜似的說道：「呀，親愛的，你說他不會開口說話麼？」</p>

<p>春秋從驚人的數字說起  人甬　　提起驚人的數字，一般人總以爲要推天文學上底數字了，你瞧：太陽底直徑爲二·五五七·七五二哩，這還不算驚人：據說地球與太陽問的距離爲二·〇七四·二九〇·〇〇〇哩，這似乎很驚人了。　　其實這個數字還算平常，因爲至少我們還有方法可以讀出位子來。這裏有一個數字是這樣：四九六·五八五·三四五·八五四·八〇〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇馬克。你能順口地把它分別唸出位子來嗎？恐怕很不方便，實在是最驚人的數字了　　這是第一决世界大戰時德國濫發紙幣的總額（一九二三年十二月底的統計），查德國在世界大戰開始前（一九一四年七月底）紙馬克底發行總額只有三·二三六·〇〇·〇〇〇馬克，這種濫發的現象在經濟學上便是所謂「通貨膨脹」，其結果便是物價增高。據載一九一三年底販賣物價指數若爲一（基年），當一九二三年十月底的物價指數已到了一八·五六八·五〇〇·〇〇〇了。從物價指數來看物價底飛漲，若不懂統計學的人看來，或許很糢糊，所以讓我來吿訴你幾件驚人的事實吧：　　究竟物價高到如何程度呢？據說，一九二三年十月初，酸牛奶一杯實價二百萬馬克，苦啤酒一杯價値七百萬馬克，火柴一根要二十萬馬克，鋼筆尖一個價値五百萬馬克。這還不算奇怪，最有趣的是一張大便用的糙紙，竟也要賣三十萬馬克，這個時侯的德國人實在連揩屁股也揩不起了。　　更有二件奇突的事，據說一個中國人初到柏林，要想雇一輛汽車，因爲車夫索價太貴，所以不要坐，豈知這個汽車夫却說：「你旣呌我停留在此，那麼卽使交易不成，也要付一千萬馬克。」還有一個中國人到一個德醫處醫病，醫生定價太貴，談不成交，這個醫生說：「你旣與我談話，那麼這一段談話時問也應付五千萬馬克哩。」眞是西諺所謂「時間卽金錢」了。　　這裏還可以做一個譬喻：歐戰前的德國人若有十萬馬克，已算富翁。等到歐戰開始後幾年，全部家產僅能買到洋芋一磅，或是寄本埠明信片一次（按洋芋每磅値十萬，本埠明信片也是十萬），若要吃鷄蛋（價的一百萬馬克），就非十個富翁傾家蕩產莫辦了。（按：以上事實係根據民國十二年十一月廿一日「德國特的通信」）可見「通貨膨脹」政策下人民生活之痛苦了。　　據最近報載，我們底「友邦」因窮兵黷武的結果，紙幣的發行額自十萬萬（日圓）增至十七萬萬圓，又據日本紀事報載稱，最近將把銀行法續加修正，再增發五萬萬圓，那麼共總額將爲念二萬萬圓了（按：這個規定單指日本銀行，至台灣銀行之發行額爲五千萬圓，朝鮮銀行爲一萬萬圓，也照原發行額超過了一倍多）。據該報載稱，這樣的增加還是在避免通貨膨脹云。　　其實呢，這樣的增發紙幣，已多少帶點「通貨膨脹」的色彩，物價的成比例的增高也是必然的結果。而且照軍部的蠻不講理的趨勢，誰又能扭保不再增發呢？且待我們靜觀後文吧！「福相」  次愷職業與智識  章榆梅　　－貢獻給商店小職員學徒們－　　爲着各人家庭環境的不同，一般幸運者到達了你們同等的年齡，有的由小學進中學，或由中學進大學，過着他們可竇貴的學校生活；可是你們呢，却爲着家庭負祖不起這貴族式的學校費用，而在商店中充一員小職員或學徒，我相信你們具有很强的求知慾，同時曉得你們底智識程度是不會超過高小敎育的，因此我曉得在你們中間，一定有着不少爲着不能滿足求知的慾望，而對於職業感到憎惡，甚至爲着求智慾過份旺盛，因此而趨於消極，這裏筆者謹希望商店職員並學徒們，不必爲着環境不允許你們高强的求知慾，而消極或憎惡職業而荒廢你們寶貴的前途。　　職業與智識原是絕對不能分離的，可是現在大多數腦筋頑固的商賈，以爲一個人在小時應該求智識，假使一踏進商店之門，就不應該再談什麼智識，抵須在商業上用腦筋。這樣便產生現在商店中就業不得求知的現象；爲了這，不知葬送了多少有作爲的靑年人，這完全是他們不明白智識對於職業的重要。譬如說，一個人沒有高尙的智能，當然得不到較好的職業；同樣的，假使連小學程度都沒有，使他來充商店的職員是不可能的，同時國家的變遷，社會的動態，都能影響到商業的發展，都需要憑觀察力去判斷；而觀察力的產生，大多是以你們的智識爲定。此外每個人的思想行爲，也可因此得到正確底指示，所以智識與職業，是分離不開的。　　在目前，允其在舊式商店中，業餘固然談不上，要想以三五個鐘點的時間來自修你們應用的智識，確實也是困難；可是我希望憑着你們個人的毅力，與求智的决心，以誠懇態度，儘量地去說服你們的經理們。萬一不能得到相當的時問，也應當在早晨規定起身時間前抽出一二鐘點來，這我想大槪可能的。只要你們有决心，肯不斷努力用功，將來一定有希望的日子。試看王雲五先生，他有今日在文化界地位，也是由不斷自修而獲得的，所以你們切忌不要爲環境所屈服。　　最後，筆者以至誠態度來介紹一本切合你們實際的刋物－自修週刋，它內容有國英文常識簿記等多種，可說是唯一業餘良好的進修讀物。劇壇外史  瞿史公　　陳鯉庭，他是個戲劇理論家，也是幾年來始終埋頭苦幹着的一個戲劇實踐家。圈外的人，很多很多說他是魯思的弟弟（過去的立報就一個例）其實他們是「同姓而不宗」，不遜凑巧他們兩人以前都是寄住在陳萬里的家裏吧了　　他的親生父母是誰？是吾還活在這人世問？連他自己也不能答覆。他是年紀很輕的時侯，便被抱到一個姓陳的富翁家裏，做他的「現成兒子」。當那富翁一死，他們族中的人就像瘋狗一樣，一只只都跳出來了，說他是別姓人家領來的。在一個小小的家族會議之下，鯉庭便被驅逐出來了。　　他的身世不消說是非常凄凉的。　　他帶着僅有的幾千塊錢離開了陳家的門：從澄衷中學到大夏大學，才唸完敎育系的課程的時候，所有的錢也完全光了。　　一九三三年一月十五日，他和高原（現在東北當義勇軍）等人組織個駱駝演劇隊。這是他最窮困的一個時期；但他好像是魯貴嘴裏的大海，「天生就是一付窮骨頭」，他不懂得苦痛，不，他在精神上反而覺得很痛快，常常餓着肚子改編劇本，說起來「放下你的鞭子」那個劇本，也正就是他那時的產物。　　他很聰明，精通英。日兩國文字，他的日文完全是自修出來的，但要比一般的留日學生却要高明得多。他的許許多多的電影戲劇的譯稿，都是從日文迻譯過來的。有一個很長的時期，他靠寫稿過着筆墨生活。　　現在，他和趙慧深正式的同居了，一塊兒在四川幹着劇運。他們倆的情感，其實遠在八一三前早已很好的了。記得有决慧深發脾氣，業除劇團的人們推鯉庭當代表去勸慧深。她還嬌臥未起，鯉庭便坐在她的床前，目不轉瞬地望着她，大約有十分鐘之久，他還沒有把來意吿拆了她。那時，在門外偸看的Y君，像哥倫布發現新大陸似的，急急的奔回辦事處報吿團員們說：「O·K了」。——現在是眞的O·K了。　　祝福他們幸福，更希望他們努力！來函　　敬啟者，本月十二日貴欄登有西蒙先生大作：「節約自由車服務社－報差們的光榮奮鬥」一文，內容同情敝社之奮鬥，嗣後敝社除勤勞自勉，更加努力，不負雅望而外，謹此對於貴欄及作者先生表示感謝之至意。惟查敝社除專代各界　禮，送物，採買及雜差而外，營業項目中並無「專差送信」一項明白規定，茲深恐引起其他之誤會起見，用特具函更正，至希將此函披露貴攔，以杜外界之誤會。謹此即頌，申報春秋欄編輯先生撰安。　　節約自由車服務社敬啟雨過天青  包天笑　　第四回　溯往事樂天傳妙語　締新交勝地作清游　　一刻兒工夫，火車已到了蘇州車站了。何儷玉眼睛尖，早已見了朱愛人在車站上，迎接她們，連忙吿訴了雙玉。她們兩人，便探首車窗之外，和朱愛人打招呼。這時三位小姐，即忙下車，趙樂天還說：『見了朱村長，代我問候問候。』因爲他是要到無錫，然後下車咧。朱愛人見了何家兩位小姐，十分親暱。這離別了兩年不到的要好同學，以前天天在一處的，今日相見，好似有說不出的離　別緖咧。這時吳君素也下了車，朱愛人本來也認識她，至此倒有些詫異。因道：『奇了！吳敎授怎麼也認得何家兩位姊姊？』吳君素笑道：『你們是要好的同學姊妹，難道我們就不應當認識嗎？』便把如何遇見了金澹雲，由金澹雲介紹，知道她們都要到自由村來。恰巧我們叉是同車，因爲兩位姊姊，不曾到過蘇州，澹雲又沒有空，陪她們來，所以託我就近照料的一番話，說了出來。又說：『倘然朱醫師不來接她們，我就陪着她們，雇汽車，或是汽船，招呼她們到你醫院中來。現在你旣然自己來接她們，我倒可以卸責了。因爲我上午雖然沒事，下午兩點鐘以後，我還有課咧。』那時吳君素正要想辭別她們，自己到學校裏去，却被朱愛人一把拖住。說道：『你想卸責，可是不讓你卸責咧。我問你：上半天你不授課，還有別的事嗎？』吳君素道：『別的事是沒有呀。』朱愛人道：『旣然沒有別的事，你也應得陪着我，游玩游玩。我今天已經吿了一天假，要下半天，我纔陪着她們兩位回去。在這裏有幾個鐘頭躭擱，你比我熟悉，請你做個嚮導員如何？』吳君素道：『到那裏去游玩呢？我也是不大熟悉的呀。』朱愛人道：『我和你雖然同是蘇州人，但是我是鄕下人，你是城裏人。而且我又不當到城裏來，出較的還是你熟悉。』她瞧一瞧手腕上的手錶道：『此刻是十點十五分了，我們到那裏去游玩一下，再找一個吃飯地方。總之兩點鐘以前，放你回去，也誤不了你的上課辰光。』吳君素道：『到那裏去呢？　上有一個地方，只是太遠了一點呢。』（四六）</p>

<p>游藝界林樹森在香港  銀絲　　訂約二十天多演關戲　粵伶薛覺先大舉捧塲　　名伶林樹森，最近率領坤旦王瑤琴，武生王筱芳等「林劇團」一行劇員，應聘赴港。業於廢歷元旦日起在利舞台登台獻藝。頭三天打跑戲日夜劇目如虎牢關，古城會·戰長沙，跑城。全部漢陽院，全部三國志等等，大部份都是演的關公戲。本來，他是一位善演紅生戲的名角；而爲了梅蘭芳劇團與盧翠蘭劇團等，以前在那裏厄於言語隔膜，未能引起當地觀眾的熱烈興趣；以及鑒於粵中人大都愛看關戲，和關戲在演出上做重於唱，觀眾易於心領神會等種種關係，他便決意盡逞所長，專將這類　　戲劇出演了。　　林樹森此次應聘去港，演期暫定爲二十天，至時是否續演，須視環境情形，再作確定。林之後隊爲金素琴，金少山，程硯秋，這已是預定的班子了。他和粵劇名伶薛覺先，原爲志同道合的知好朋友。因此在到港那天，薛覺先便爲大學捧塲，當時率領影劇兩界同人百餘員，張起了「八和粵劇協進會，歡迎林樹森先生到港」（薛爲該會主席）的橫額式的大旗，人頭擠擠的在碼頭上鵠立迎迓。那一番很熱鬧的演出塲面，竟和歡迎什麼要人到埠一般，也眞可說是够得誇張的了。　　薛覺行在香港兼營電影事業。改組後的南粵公司，他也是一位主要人物。當晚，除爲林劇團全體設宴洗塵外，又復陪往南粵攝影塲參觀拍演「麻雀經」影片。林樹森當與各影人拍照多張，留作紀念。右刊銅圖一幅，是和該片主角薛覺先及主人庸雲卿合攝的照影。林樹森（中）與薛覺先夫婦蒨蒨室劇話　談探母回令（上）  張肖傖　　愚嘗謂舊劇中有兩齣佳作，寫母子之愛，伉儷之愛，手足之情，公私之義，而皆在極怱迫之時間與環境中，須籌一委曲周全之策者，即「寶蓮燈」與「探母回令」是也。此兩劇不僅情文並茂，唱作俱佳，目能將情理法三方面一一顧到。「寶蓮燈」爲生旦對工戲，而「探母回令」係以生角一人先後應付公主六郎太君四夫人蕭太後諸人，唱做並重，無異以一人之力，與諸角作軍輪大戰，非確具工候者，决不易通體一致，始終不懈。且此戲爲袍帶戲，自是正生風格，在昔奎派擅唱此劇，良以奎派字正腔圓，聲宏氣足，加以扮相雍容，氣象矞皇，確是正生本色。愚談唱工鬆生，有一定論，以爲吾人不必問爲汪爲譚爲孫爲　爲余爲馬，或竟拔戲自樹一幟別成一派，其基礎必先從奎派着手。正如學書法者必從正楷習起，同一理由。奎派中人若張二奎楊月樓許蔭棠早年之能以探母轟動菊部者，即其能以探母轟動菊部者，即其能牢握正生之風格，卓然自成家故也。譚鑫培此劇即以奎派之探母爲基礎，從而融會變化之，歌來圓妙自然，渾厚委宛，寓蒼涼於淸剛雋逸之中，峭而能堅，得剛柔相濟之妙，無纔佻薄弱之短。其在見娘別妻兩塲之工於悲音，抑揚轉折緣情善感，纏綿悱惻，具一唱三歎之妙。老譚自始至終，唱做雖屬十分繁重，而能舉重若輕，妙造自然，誠爲絕唱。惜其人物化已久，響沉音絕，所留以示人者，僅百代公司之唱片餘韻，猶能令人興此曲天上之感耳。某方轉托俄人出面　向各製片公司收買新片  雲　　某方意圖利用中國電影，在宣傳上作某項企圖，故擬投資五百萬元於各製片公司，幸各公司當局深明大義未予接受。某方乃轉變辦法，先行試探收買各製片公司之新片，曾有「茶花女」被收買運日，在東京放映，而大事宣傳爲日支文化合作之和平先聲，此事已爲各界一致抨擊而引起國人嚴重之注意。　　最近，某方因感直接向中國製片公司購片之不便，乃轉托俄人卡洛夫出面，聲言哈爾濱及東北方面需要中國出品之新片，連日專向各製片公司接洽收買，但各公司因有「茶花女」事件被攻擊在先，故感其戒心，未敢貿然允許。此俄人原爲哈爾濱之影片商，現下榻於外白渡橋禮查飯店，專爲此事奔走者已有二星期之久，某方現又認爲利用俄人無效，乃復多方設法，覓得中國電影界某從業員，將以替代俄人卡洛夫作遊說方法收買新片，深望各公司溫熱蹈光明公司之覆轍可耳。古城兩大劇院之籌建  梅花館主　　一在西城西單牌樓定名黃金　一在東城王府井街定名中國　　古都戲館。愚足跡所至者，有城南游藝園附近之新民大戲院。大柵欄之慶樂園三慶園。西柳樹井大街之開明大戲院。及第一舞臺。東城王府井大街東安市塲內之吉祥閣。東華門大街之眞光大戲院。本爲電影院，六七年前，梅蘭芳嘗出演於是），西河夾道之　環舞臺，（爲民國二十年所新建者，荀慧生股份最多，開幕之日，即由荀慧生演玉堂春及白娘子新劇，愚得躬逢其盛，引爲快峯，以後從未去過，）至於前年新建之「長安」「新新」兩大戲院，（均在西長安街）愚去年北游時，雖數週其地，惜未曾入內觀光，惟見其規模宏大，式樣新穎，俱遠在售有各戲院上耳，（第一舞臺應除外）最近接平友來函，調古都自去秋迄今，人口陡增，戲館營業，頗有畸形之發展，原有各戲院，幾有不能相容之勢，思想　敏者，乃從事於新戲院之籌建，已開始籌備者，有「北平黃金大戲院及北平中國大戲院」二家，刻均在積極進行中，茲分述其槪況於後：　　黃金大戲院　地址在西單牌樓，卽恒麗綢緞莊舊址，由平市名流多人，負責籌備，資本額議定國幣三十萬元，一切計劃，由汪申建築師負責設計　，惟由領袖人物知照，須採用最新式之式樣爲主要綱領，建築形狀，決依照歐美最摩登之流綫型式，務求力臻美化，俾使平地人士一擴眼界，俟汪建築師計劃書及房屋圖樣擬具完備後，再提付董事會（即最高當局）表決，開始興工，當在廢歷新下，至於戲院定名，決計採用「黃金」二字，大槪不至有所改變也。　　中國大戲院　地址已擇定東城王府井大街中原公司後面空地，創辦人係另一幫古城之聞人，其計劃亦正由某工程師負責起草中，資本總額究定若干，此刻尚未正式議決，大約至少亦須在三十萬元以上，或更須超過黃金，亦未可知，據某工程家傳出消息，黃金方面之容量，預定以二千人上下爲標準，中國旣欲與黃金抗衡，當然須着着占先，式樣固須盡量考究，即坐位一項，亦宜設法使其增多，至於興工時期，戒須在黃金動工之後，蓋他山之石，可以攻錯，然至遲決不出淸明節之後云。余叔岩贊許「楊寶森」  方劍雲　　允爲將來之傳人　　楊寶森之老生學于陳秀華而私淑余叔岩，雖未經余氏親口指點，而畢年余氏挑班三慶時，寶森日夜偷習，即雖風雨晦明，亦未嘗間斷。余嘗謂舞台之演員，當其現身說法之時，吾儕觀者即可在台下默首心授，其台步腔調，以及一切神氣，均可一目瞭然；一而再，再而三，自然可以惟妙惟肖，亦步亦趨。況耳音之熏染，平素之研習，當可不差分毫。寶森有鑒于此，數年如一日，無怪其一投足，一舉手，一放眼，一揚眉，宛然余氏。聞余氏個人亦頗贊許寶森，允爲將來傳人，寶森學余，不但在其輪廓中不失規模，即其微末，他人不及注意之處，亦莫不應心順手。所唱之劇，凡余不演者，寶森不與焉其篤信之誠，意志之堅在伶界中可稱獨一無二。以現代生行中之人物，雖路數不同，而一方趨於潮流，一方碍於經濟，故不得不去舊更新，迎合觀眾之心理，此種苦衷亦不能不原宥也。黃桂秋將演「燕子箋」　　管紹華嗓音失潤昨休養　　名旦黃桂秋，鬚生管紹華隷演天蟾舞台，顧曲界趨之若驚，聲譽極盛，而台主顧竹軒爲迎合觀眾心理計，對院務竭力整頓，淸除積弊，營業蒸蒸日上，非偶然也。桂秋擅演舊劇而外，復有私房秘劇多部，自漢來申後，即雇員繕寫，重行整理，即擬於登台時一一搬演。桂秋嘗自編名劇燕子箋，六年前已脫稿，從未公世，近玉霜以此劇名於時，後來居上，桂秋乃決在海上一漏，以別苗頭。去歲，越劇作者樊籬君爲坤伶姚水娟編是劇，演後殊受歡迎，桂秋曾往參觀，並加指導，是以此番出演天蟾，當爲燕子箋脫穎之機會，故桂秋邇已着手準備，與顧曲界相見，會當不遠，吾知必有極大之收獲也。囊桂秋說戲，有秘書李亦靑爲之代勞，今李君已歸道山，桂秋頓失臂助，事必躬親，故對李帆哀念不置也。　　鬚生管紹華在申初露頭角，一鳴驚人，其嗓音之嘹亮甜凈，韻味之醇厚幽遠，極受顧曲界之賞識，咸推爲後起中之佼佼者。日前與桂秋合演四郎探母，賣力殊甚，精彩百出，乃於下塲卸裝時，突受風寒，致嗓音失潤，幾不能歌，自昨日起，紹華暫告休養，迨一二日內復原後，再行登台。　　女彈詞家何琴芳與其兄蕓芳在電台播音時的神情棋苑  鮑子波編　隨承鑄校　　對局　第十五局　　　饒左馬　　　紅先　　鮑子波先　張慶令　　着法　　砲二平五　砲二平五　砲八平七　車一進一　車一平四　兵九進一　馬九進八　帥五平六　車四進四　車一進一　車六進七　士五進四　（圖如上）　馬二進三　馬八進九　砲八進六　砲七進四　砲五進四　士六進五　車四進二　砲七進三　士四進五　象七進五　車九進二　馬八退七　車四平三　車九平六　車九平四　車一平二　車三平四　（紅勝）故都宮闈梨園秘史（一一四）  徐慕雲　　老譚演烏龍院之絕技　　「烏龍院」這齣戲，有唱有作，爲生旦並重，有骨子的名劇。近人衹知此劇爲英禿之傑作，復配以田大媽（桂鳳）的閻惜嬌，一時號爲變絕；實則老譚還是學的他盟史張勝奎，某年虎坊橋湖廣會館約老譚同田桂鳳合演是劇，由王栓子去張文遠，羅百歲去媽兒娘，首齣戲得這四位名角一同出演，眞可稱爲珠聯壁合，旗鼓相當了。據說那次演劇的本意，一非堂會，二非賑災，三非館子裏的營業，四非爲窮朋友搭桌；（北平有些不顧顏面的戲忙子平日與伶人頗有交往，每到年節賬主逼門，實在過不去啦，就墾求伶人替他唱一天義務，票價收入，除零碎開支外，完全飽入私囊，似此單爲某一人唱的義務戲，即名曰搭桌。）而演這一次戲的原因，說來也實在替票友們增光。原來幾十年前的北平老票友，的確眞肯用工夫學戲，他們聽到某人的甚麼戲有獨擅的地方，馬上就湊合幾個人，共出幾百兩銀子，專請某伶主演該劇，來供他們的研究揣摹。這齣「烏龍院」裏，老譚有種玩弄高方巾的絕活，敢說是空前絕後，因此這般戲迷才湊了五百兩銀子，致贈譚老板諸人，爲的是專看這戲，門口也並不賣票，希圖挽回這種損失，看戲的人除掉出錢的幾位闊淸客高坐在前排以外，其餘的座位多半都是各票房的會員，同內行裏一般想來偷戲的。在幾十年前生活程度極低的時候，這五百兩的代價，可也眞算高到無以復加了。家庭聯歡會誌盛  秋　　家庭工業社發行所同人於二月廿三日晚七時假座華聯同樂會舉行家庭聯歡會，筆者躬逢盛會，茲將觀感拉雜記之如次，主席領導開會後，第一塲是集體歌唱「天倫」，宏亮委婉，耐人尋味，話劇第一塲表演「藝術家」，劇情深刻，極盡諷刺之能事，演員張益芹原是畫家，飾藝術家，沉着冷靜，却能恰到好處。陳彩珍女士飾藝術家之妻，虛榮潑辣，描摹盡致。湯漁光飾古董商，老氣橫秋，有入木三分之妙。朱慕陶飾藝術之之弟，口音嘹亮，表演動人，尤爲傑出人材。第二幕爲「殺人」由華聯話劇組客串，表演純熟，使觀眾情緒突然緊張，誠屬空前盛舉。其餘如秦星霖君之魔術，手法輕快；友聲社客串之國樂，幽雅仰揚；益友社之國術，精彩百出；爲觀眾所嘆賞。最後開映難民電影，每一觀眾，均手携贈品，在音樂聲中盡歡而散。</p>

<p>Bishop Yu Reports on the Situation of the War of Resistance, Overseas Compatriots Are Deeply Moved</p>
<p>(Chongqing) New York, February 13th airmail: Bishop Yu Bin left Paris on February 1st. Local overseas Chinese compatriots gathered to see him off. Father Jiang, a French priest who has been in Guilin for more than ten years and is extremely concerned about China, admired Bishop Yu's great personality. He personally escorted him to the Harpeng Port before departing, where the local archpriest hurriedly arrived on the "Paris" ship to see him off. He expressed to Bishop Yu that he represented the entire priesthood in paying respect to Bishop Yu. They understood the causes and consequences of the Sino-Japanese War, stating that all those who advocated justice and loved peace in the world believed that China's war of resistance was a battle between light and darkness, as well as a battle between the culture of Jesus Christ and barbaric warmongering. If China's war of resistance were to fail, the current world would inevitably regress two thousand years. Therefore, they were offering their most sincere prayers to this messenger of the culture of Jesus Christ, so that the great mission could be completed and justice and humanity could be maintained without fail. Their attitude was sincere and admirable. This demonstrates the sympathy of people around the world for our war of resistance. Upon Yu's arrival in New York, the local consul general and representatives of more than 60 overseas Chinese organizations, as well as American friends, were waiting at the pier. The local authorities even dispatched dozens of police officers to provide protection, which was exceptionally thorough. Important figures from more than 60 organizations representing 40,000 overseas Chinese were waiting at the Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Association, where a grand welcome ceremony was held. Chairman Huang Shangnong reported the significance of the welcome ceremony, followed by a speech by Bishop Yu, who elaborated in detail on the situation of the first phase of the war of resistance and the entry into the second phase. His conclusion was that Japan's attempt at a quick victory had been completely shattered. On the contrary, the Chinese side's strategies and tactics had made great progress, morale was extremely high, and the whole country was more united in spirit, unanimously and resolutely supporting the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and the National Government. Overseas Chinese compatriots were deeply moved by Bishop Yu's speech, listening quietly for more than an hour. When he finished speaking, the crowd applauded enthusiastically, lasting for more than ten minutes. Overseas Chinese compatriots were extremely concerned about their motherland. Hearing this sincere account from Bishop Yu, they were extremely excited and rushed forward to shake his hand. When Bishop Yu left the meeting place, dozens of boy scouts were waiting outside to pay their respects. Its grandeur was rare in recent welcome ceremonies. (25th Instant Telegram)</p>

<p>Hequ. In the middle of last month, in the Battle of Zhongtiao Mountain, the officers and soldiers of the Chinese troops fought bravely, crushing the Japanese's so-called "mopping-up" attempt. Chairman Chiang and Commander Yan specially issued an order to commend them. (25th Instant Telegram)</p>
<p>Tongguan. In the area north of Shanxi, four to five hundred Japanese infantry, more than two hundred cavalry, accompanied by fourteen cannons, are currently heading south from Guoxian.

<p>(Chongqing) According to reliable sources, Chairman Chiang ordered the Executive Yuan yesterday to instruct the mayors of Chongqing, Chengdu, and Guiyang to quickly evacuate civilians from the three cities in order to avoid being bombed by Japanese aircraft. He also ordered that all new houses built in the future must have adequate air raid protection facilities, and that all banks, shops, schools, post offices, telegraph offices, etc., must also be moved to the suburbs to prevent them from being affected when Japanese aircraft bomb government agencies.

<p>(Lanzhou) On the 20th, the Chinese Air Force displayed great prowess, shooting down a total of nine Japanese aircraft. Among them, one aircraft had the Japanese squadron leader, Tian Rongzhi, on board, and a Japanese bombing order was also found, detailing the bombing targets. The first was the barracks, and the second was government agency civilian housing, which shows the ironclad evidence that the Japanese deliberately bomb undefended cities and massacre innocent civilians.

<h3 id="e14">Expectations for the National Education Conference <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>The National Education Conference will open in Chongqing on March 1st. At a time when military affairs are so pressing, the government authorities are still able to pay attention to the long-term plan of education, convene the National Education Conference, and calmly discuss it. Such a spirit of foresight is truly admirable! Furthermore, this fact can fully demonstrate that in China's war of resistance, politics has already been put on the right track and is moving towards the road of national reconstruction, which is so gratifying and exciting!</p>
<p>Education cannot be separated from the actual needs of society and exist in isolation. It is very closely related to politics. Whatever needs arise in politics, education must and inevitably adapt to them. China, in the process of resisting aggression and building the nation, naturally requires educational facilities for resisting aggression and building the nation. Since the August 13th Incident and up to the present day, there have clearly been many reforms in Chinese education to adapt to actual requirements, and several regulations on wartime education have been promulgated; however, they are not enough to represent a systematic spirit within the entire structure. All theoretical systems must be built based on the experience of actual actions; the twenty months of resistance have provided sufficient experience to promote the establishment of long-term principles for resisting aggression and building the nation in the future. Therefore, the National Education Conference, held at this time, will definitely be able to absorb the actual experience of the past twenty months and organize it into a complete theoretical system as a facility outline for future long-term actions. We dare to wish the National Education Conference a complete success on this isolated island thousands of miles away!</p>
<p>What issues the National Education Conference will discuss, the representatives, experts, and government authorities must have meticulous plans; however, we, in scrutinizing the needs of the nation and the people, have the following expectations for the National Education Conference.</p>
<p>First, in China today, where the nation is supreme and resistance is paramount, education must naturally adapt to the needs of resisting aggression and building the nation. However, the so-called resistance is by no means limited to military actions; the so-called national reconstruction must go through a long process; therefore, education for resisting aggression and building the nation must have both comprehensive and long-term characteristics. This National Education Conference should at least accomplish the following three tasks: 1. Formulate practical plans for popularizing education, urging the government to extensively and earnestly promote compulsory education and literacy education, so that all the nation's citizens, regardless of age, can receive the minimum amount of education in the shortest possible time, helping to quickly complete the work of resisting aggression and building the nation. 2. Reorganize the various outlines of wartime education since the August 13th Incident, and then collect opinions contributed from all sides, agree on a plan, and request the government to revise the curriculum standards of schools at all levels, so as to make them suitable for the needs of resisting aggression and building the nation and the spirit of the national anti-Japanese united front. Although the previous curriculum standards were the crystallization of the minds of various education experts and had many excellent points, in fact, they clearly lacked a practical manifestation of the spirit of resisting aggression and building the nation; moreover, under the influence of the "Good Neighborliness" order during the 24th and 25th years of the Republic (1935-1936), the school curriculum was also forced to fade somewhat in color, and this past regret must be remedied at present. 3. Due to the fact that the mass organizations have not been sound enough and the fact that traitors are rampant, it is clear that Chinese education urgently needs to emphasize national spirit and increase the component of spiritual training. In the fields of both mass education and children's education, emotional cultivation and will cultivation must be given equal weight to the teaching of knowledge, so as to cultivate the universal and lasting spirit of the Chinese people, who would rather die than surrender to the enemy.</p>
<p>Second, China's past education, whether in guiding principles or implementing systems, has shown a state of disorganized steps and imitation of foreign countries; the fundamental reason is due to the complexity of China's social form, so education experts often focus on the needs of coastal and riverside urban societies, while neglecting the actual situation of the vast interior. Such unrealistic education is of course not very efficient; especially in the current extraordinary period of resisting aggression and building the nation, it is even more difficult to generate any positive effect. This National Education Conference should recognize this point, and in addition to meeting the needs of resisting aggression and building the nation, should correct the past chaotic and imitative pathologies in improving all educational principles or systems, and build a unique Chinese education system. At present, China's construction center of gravity has shifted from the coast and riverside to the interior, which must have many practical problems that can promote the basic construction of Chinese education.</p>
<p>Third, the National Education Conference should establish a plan for education in guerrilla areas, because in the vast guerrilla areas, there are many out-of-school youths and children, and the Japanese side and the puppet organizations are taking advantage of the opportunity to carry out their policy of enslavement education, and the Chinese side should quickly plan a method to remedy this. For example, allowing youths and children in guerrilla areas to study at home on their own, and then obtaining the equivalent of a school graduation qualification after passing a certain examination, but once they enter a puppet school to study, they will be deprived of this right. This is also a potentially effective method, and it is hoped that the National Education Conference will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3 id="e16">Military Spokesperson Discusses One Week of Battle Situation <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The military commission spokesperson discussed the battle situation of the past week (February 15th to 21st). The fronts, both north and south, have become more active than the previous week. Our loyal and brave officers and soldiers, with the spirit of becoming stronger with each battle, are striving for continuous efforts. It is believed that the air force's brave men, killing enemies and achieving results, have already inflicted the most severe blows on the Japanese, making the people's hearts and morale more aware that victory in the war of resistance is indeed within grasp. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Guangdong Front: The situations on the Guangzhou-Kowloon, Guangdong-Hankou, and Guangzhou-Sanshui railways have not changed significantly. Japanese troops in Taiping, Dongguan, combined infantry and artillery at noon on the 16th and attacked Ze’an in one part, while another part landed in Nantou on the 17th to encircle. Chinese defending troops bravely fought back. By noon on the 17th, due to a significant disparity in numbers, the positions were slightly shifted. Subsequently, a large number of Chinese reinforcements arrived and launched a fierce counterattack against the Japanese troops from front and back, taking advantage of the night. The Japanese troops suffered heavy losses and collapsed in disarray. The Chinese army then recovered Shi’an. In this battle, more than 300 Japanese soldiers were killed, and a large number of guns, artillery, and military supplies were captured. The Chinese army is now pursuing the victory, and Dongguan may soon be captured. In the northern section, the Japanese troops in the Huaxian area have been attacked by Chinese troops everywhere, resulting in over a thousand Japanese casualties. The remaining Japanese troops are holding their fortifications to the death, having become turtles in a jar and will not be difficult to completely eliminate. Japanese troops in Haikou, Qiongshan, and Chengmai on Hainan Island have been continuously attacked by Chinese soldiers and civilians on the 15th and 16th, leading to chaos. Over 3,000 were killed, leading to large-scale massacres of civilians to vent their anger, building fortifications and engaging in stubborn defense. Simultaneously, on the 16th, they landed in Sanya Bay in the south of the island and invaded Yulin in an attempt to contain the Chinese forces. The Chinese army, aware of their scheme, has divided its forces to intercept them, making it difficult for the Japanese troops to succeed. Furthermore, on the 21st, several Japanese aircraft came to harass the vicinity of Chengmai and two were shot down by the Chinese, with the remaining aircraft damaged and fleeing.</p>
<p>(2) Shanxi Front: In eastern Shanxi, since the Chinese army surrounded Heshun, there have been fierce battles in the past week, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers. On the 17th and 18th, large forces were dispatched to pursue the remaining Japanese troops fleeing towards Xiyang and Pingding. The Japanese troops fled in panic and were killed in large numbers. The Chinese army completely wiped out the Japanese troops south of Zhongtiao Mountain in the previous week. In the past week, there have been fierce battles in Jiexian, Anyi, Wenxi, and Jiangxian north of the mountain. On the morning of the 15th, the Chinese army recovered Zengjiaying and Renwumiao northwest of Jiexian. In the afternoon, they captured Guanzhuangzhen and Wangyukou east of Anyi. On the 17th, they captured the strongholds of Caozhang and Shuitou south of Wenxi. The Japanese suffered over 900 casualties, abandoning a large amount of equipment, ammunition, and supplies. Japanese troops in Henglingguan and Hengshuiba in Jiangxian have recently increased by four to five thousand men, relying on superior artillery fire cover for days, fiercely attacking Dongguanzhuang and Yaofengtou, and deploying large amounts of tear gas. Chinese officers and soldiers bravely fought back, with fierce fighting. The Japanese troops have so far failed to succeed. The day before yesterday evening, they turned to attack south of Guanzhuang, where Chinese ambush troops were lying in wait, leaving corpses everywhere. The situation is still at a stalemate.</p>
<p>(3) Hunan-Hubei Front: The northern and central parts of Hubei were quiet, with both sides in a state of confrontation. On the southern Hubei front, the Japanese troops were attacked by a large Chinese force at noon on the 15th. Due to the intense Chinese artillery fire, the Japanese suffered heavy casualties and released a large amount of poison gas. Unexpectedly, the wind direction suddenly changed, causing the Japanese to kill over 2,000 of their own troops. Chinese officers and soldiers bravely charged and killed, causing the Japanese army to collapse. That night, Jinshui was recovered. The remaining Japanese troops fled towards Heshengqiao. The positions of Jinkou and Huanglingji southwest of Wuchang were also successively recovered by the Chinese army on the 16th and 17th, destroying over 30 Japanese vehicles and capturing over 100 rifles. The remaining Japanese troops retreated to the areas of Duntou, Tongcheng, Beigang, and Wanjia Mountain. Chinese guerrillas also exerted great power, frequently launching strong attacks against the Japanese army, killing many Japanese soldiers. Yangloudong Station was also sabotaged by the Chinese army. Currently, the Japanese water and land transportation west of Wuchang and north of Yueyang is completely controlled by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>(4) Henan Front: The war in southern Henan was quiet. The Japanese troops entrenched in Xinyang were heavily bombed by the Chinese air force the day before yesterday, causing heavy losses. Over 2,000 Japanese troops in Xinwu and Bo’ai in northern Henan began to attack eastwards in separate routes from the 17th. They were ambushed by a certain unit of the Chinese army, causing extremely heavy Japanese casualties. They fled back along their original routes, where they were intercepted by the Chinese army along the way. The Japanese troops scattered and fled in disarray, with over 1,200 killed. Furthermore, over 2,000 Japanese troops, over ten tanks, and over fifty vehicles from Xinxiang, Xiuwu, and Xiaojizhen attacked the Chinese forces on the 18th and 19th. They were met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army, resulting in fierce fighting. The Japanese suffered over 1,300 casualties, destroying five Japanese tanks and over ten vehicles. The remaining Japanese troops collapsed and retreated. Additionally, over a thousand Japanese troops attacking eastwards from Qinyang were ambushed by a certain Chinese unit on the 15th, suffering heavy losses. The remaining Japanese troops fled in disarray towards Wuzhi, where the Chinese army pursued and annihilated over 400 Japanese soldiers.</p>
<p>(5) Other Fronts: In southern Hebei, the Chinese army launched a large-scale counterattack against the Japanese troops for days. In the battle of Qinghe on the 17th, over 300 Japanese soldiers were killed. In the battle of Daming on the 18th, over 1,500 Japanese soldiers were killed. The Japanese troops fled in disarray, suffering a great defeat. The areas of Xiyang, Suzong, Renqiu, and Chengxian in central Hebei are also under continued siege and will soon be captured. Chinese troops in Fanchang, southern Anhui, inflicted heavy losses on Japanese troops attacking from Digang, killing over a thousand Japanese soldiers and a Japanese battalion commander. The Japanese troops are now greatly exhausted and unable to attack again. In addition, the 3,000-strong puppet army of Zhou Xuanchen in Xuzhou, the 2,000-strong puppet army of Liu Hukai in northern Sui, and the 3,000-strong unit of Yu Zhiqian defected and returned in the past week, fighting bravely alongside the local Chinese troops. The Japanese were alarmed and felt a serious threat. Furthermore, in the air battle over Lanzhou, as many as nine Japanese aircraft were shot down. The Japanese air raid plan was completely foiled. As mentioned above, the Chinese army has repeatedly achieved victories on all land fronts, and has achieved great results in aerial combat, which not only exhausts the Japanese army but also causes great psychological trauma, which is enough to give the entire Chinese anti-Japanese soldiers unparalleled excitement.

<p>(London) At this morning's annual shareholder meeting of HSBC, Chairman Peel stated that the major powers related to the Far East have clearly expressed their position, that is, to abide by international obligations. Any unilateral act to change international obligations will not be considered by the major powers. Peel also stressed the importance of the major powers assisting the Shanghai Municipal Council, but did not criticize the British policy in the Far East. He also said that our important interests in the Far East's economic structure have made it our top priority to fulfill treaties and agreements. Although the Chinese government is currently unable to shoulder the responsibility of raising 400,000 pounds a month to meet debt payments, public debt obligations have been fulfilled as usual to this day, and default may still be avoided in the future. Although the Hong Kong business community has been adversely affected by the fall of Guangzhou and the blockade of other South China ports, no panic has occurred. We are prepared to look forward to this year's developments. Hong Kong's currency and finance are very stable, and we have no worries about the future. Regarding the increasingly dangerous state of Sino-Japanese relations, if mediation is not carried out early, the rift between the two sides will definitely deepen and become more difficult to mend. Peel continued to report on the bank's operating conditions, stating that last year's net surplus reached 15,296,621 yuan, assets increased by 42,000,000 yuan compared to last year, investments increased by 30,000,000 yuan, and acceptable loans and notes decreased by 59,000,000 yuan.

<p>If the Japanese Army Does Not Receive Reinforcements, It Will Be Incapable of Attacking</p>
<p>The Road to Capturing Changsha Will Be Difficult to Achieve in Three Ways</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Reading the Hunan Province war situation over the past month, the Chinese and Japanese sides have always been deadlocked in the area within thirty miles of southern Yueyang. At present, the Japanese garrison in that area is part of the 9th and 13th Divisions, and the puppet army of Li Shouxin and others, totaling less than 60,000 people. If they do not receive reinforcements, they will not have the strength to attack. However, what is worth speculating about is how the future war situation will evolve. At the end of the old lunar year, the reporter, braving rain and snow, departed from Xiangyin to inspect the front line. The scenery was excellent, with cold crows and solitary wild ducks. Xiangyin is thirty Chinese miles away from Changsha. Talents have emerged in large numbers since the Qing Dynasty, such as Zuo Zongtang and Guo Gaotao, the most famous. Sixty miles north of the city, there is a place called Yingtian, which was the garrison area when Yue Fei used troops in the Song Dynasty. Six miles north of Yingtian is Leishi Mountain, towering majestic, remotely facing the Nanshan Mountain in Yueyang, one hundred and twenty miles to the north, with sails up and down, serving as a pillar in the middle of the river. The reporter and a certain regiment and others climbed to the mountain peak and discussed the future war situation in Dongting. Dongting is two hundred and ten miles long, one hundred and fifty miles wide, with an area of 15,000 square miles. The normal water volume is greatest from the third to the fifth or sixth months of the lunar calendar, with a water depth from a certain foot to a certain foot. After August, it gradually decreases, and in winter, it is shallow and dry. Currently, residents have built embankment walls around the deserted land along the lake. The land along the lake is fertile and easy to cultivate, but there is more and more wasteland, and the lake surface is becoming narrower. To date, the entire Naxian County and parts of the counties of Huarong, Yuanjiang, and Xiangyin, which used to be part of Dongting Lake, have changed from sea to farmland. But today, from a military point of view, it is precisely because the lake surface is narrow and the depth is uneven that the Japanese army cannot apply its skills. The southwest banks of Dongting have many shallows, and the waves can submerge the top of the head. Even in the summer when the water rises, it is not easy for speedboats to dock. This is one reason. If Japanese warships want to cross Dongting to attack Changsha to the west, it is not permitted by the facts, because the lake water depth varies. Usually, boats traveling from Yingjing, Yueyang to Changde pass through a certain place to enter Changde. Japanese warships have a deeper draft and have no way to go directly from Yueyang to Changde. This is the second reason. Dongting Lake has thousands of miles of silt, and the water level varies. The Japanese do not have precise surveys. Remembering when the reporter was on the eastern battlefield, he read a Japanese map of Taihu that had been captured, detailing the water depth in any place, whether it was spring, summer, autumn, or winter, and the number of ships with a certain draft that could be moored. The maps also noted how much food was available and the conditions of local residents. Some of the Japanese army's maps even went into such detail as to be at a scale of 1:2000. The fact that they planned to invade us with such specialized cunning inspires even this enemy to be struck with admiration. Now the military maps that the Japanese army uses when penetrating deep into the Yangtze River are all stolen from the Chinese side and are incomplete. In a certain headquarters, the reporter was able to see the latest maps of the Yueyang and Xiangyin areas seized from the Japanese. One part was at a scale of 1:25,000 and the other at 1:100,000, and this 1:100,000 map was enlarged and printed in combination with the 1:25,000 map for use. There was no survey of water level depth, and even the land maps were not as detailed as the Chinese maps. Although the Japanese worked hard, they were simply exhausting their minds and getting nowhere. This is the third reason. With these three reasons, it is not easy for the Japanese army to use the rising water of Dongting to invade Changsha. Taking a comprehensive view of the Japanese army in northern Hunan and southern Hubei, there are three important roads that they can take to attack Changsha. One is to attack south along the Hunan-Hubei Highway and the northern section of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway. This place has dangerous terrain, and the Chinese army is densely deployed, making it difficult for the Japanese to succeed. Another is to join forces with the Japanese army advancing west along the Hanchuan Highway and upstream along the Yangtze River at Shashi, disturbing Changde to the south. This is a major detour, and the attack is also not easy. The third is for the navy to enter the Xiang River by water. Although Dongting is large, this is the only way that is convenient for shipping. In the summer when the water rises, × thousand-ton ships can travel directly from Hankou to Xiangtan. However, the current situation is very different. If the Japanese follow this road to invade southward, they will first be blocked at Jiaoluoshi (the Japanese army has repeatedly used speedboats to harass this place, but they have been repelled), and then they will be blocked at a certain mountain, the third at ××, the fourth at ×××, and the fifth at ××. Among them, two or three are considered to be the most dangerous. Currently, the river ports and waterways have been heavily blockaded, and various battlefields have been deployed at each blockade point. The troops who are called "stubborn" by the Japanese army can rest assured about the defense of the lake. A certain division commander told the reporter, "If the Japanese army wants to rely on its navy to carry out its always proud amphibious landings and invade Changsha by water, we will see their feet sink deeper and deeper into the mud, and they will eventually be unable to extricate themselves. The vast Dongting Lake will probably be their burial place." (Dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>Chanting Slogans to Overthrow Foreign Minister Beck - German Officials Maintain Temporary Silence</p>
<p>Warsaw: Yesterday afternoon, more than five hundred young people, mostly students belonging to radical right-wing opposition parties, held an anti-German demonstration in Warsaw, gathering in front of the German Embassy and demanding that Danzig be united with Poland. The demonstrators sang anti-German songs, and police arrived and dispersed them. The demonstrators then sent a delegation to the Ministry of Defense, demanding that the authorities "liberate Danzig and East Prussia." After a while, the leader of the delegation resigned and declared that the Ministry of Defense expressed its gratitude to the students for raising this request to the military authorities. It is reported that another anti-German demonstration will be held tomorrow. (Haitong dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Today, Polish news media and university students launched a large-scale anti-German demonstration. By evening, the anti-German sentiment had reached its peak. Several hundred students gathered in front of the Polish Supreme Command, seeking to see the military supervisor, Smigly-Rydz, and shouting loudly, "We are ready, lead us to Danzig!" They shouted continuously, but Smigly did not come out to see this group of people. According to the police, more than two thousand university students held a meeting at four universities, expressing fierce anti-German remarks and inciting public sentiment. They then went to the German Embassy, attempting to cause trouble. They were later dispersed by the police, and seventeen people were arrested on the spot. This anti-German demonstration is a response to the recent mass meeting held by the German Socialist Party in Danzig. When the Germans gathered there, they posted a notice saying "Poles and dogs are forbidden to enter," which was widely reported in Polish newspapers, thus arousing the anger of Polish students. (Associated Press dispatch on the 24th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: After Polish students at the Danzig Industrial School were expelled from the school by German students and National Socialist stormtroopers, university students here once held an anti-German demonstration yesterday. Today, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano happened to arrive in Warsaw, so the foreign ministry authorities asked the student union to suspend the demonstration, but the students refused and continued to hold the anti-German demonstration, chanting slogans to overthrow Foreign Minister Beck. The students first held a meeting at the Guangyi School, publicly reading a telegram from the Danzig Polish student groups, which described the incident. They then passed a resolution advocating a boycott of German goods, and distributed leaflets with the message, "Poles, the reason our compatriots in Danzig are in distress is due to the current government's pro-German policy." After the meeting, the students planned to march in front of the German Embassy, but were dispersed by the police, so they divided into small groups and headed towards the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, shouting "Overthrow Foreign Minister Beck" along the way. They were again stopped by the police and were unable to approach the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In addition, anti-German demonstrations also occurred in Krakow and Vilnius. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that an anti-German movement had broken out again in Poznan, Poland, last night. A group of Polish university students attacked secondary schools and shops established by Germans, destroying their glass windows. Some elderly German expatriates were also beaten. Political figures here were extremely concerned upon hearing the news, but did not want to express any opinion before receiving details. (Havas dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>Poles Will Not Tolerate Insulting Behavior by National Socialists</p>
<p>Danzig Free City – A hotel in Danzig City, owned by National Socialists, refused to serve Polish people and posted a notice at the entrance stating "No Poles Allowed," sparking protests by Polish students. They passed a resolution demanding that the Polish government safeguard them from such insults to the nation. This attitude of the Polish students has worsened relations between Danzig City and Poland. It is reported that the resolution has been sent to the Polish Parliament and has been reported in Warsaw newspapers. Danzig City confiscated these newspapers. The Danzig Senate then lodged a written protest with the Polish diplomatic representative in Danzig yesterday regarding the tension between Danzig City and Poland caused by the students' resolution and newspaper reports. (Haitong Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>Warsaw – According to news from Danzig Free City, a serious conflict occurred today between German and Polish university students in the area. A number of German university students, many of whom were members of the National Socialist stormtroopers, attempted to forcibly expel Polish students from the city's industrial specialized school, resulting in a clash. The Polish students were outnumbered and eventually expelled. Regarding this matter, the Polish High Commissioner to Danzig Free City, Mr. Chodacki, lodged a protest with the Free City's Senate and demanded that immediate measures be taken to protect the safety of Polish students. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>Warsaw – According to news received by the Polish News Agency, the truth of the Danzig incident is as follows: After a conflict between German and Polish students of the Danzig Industrial University in a cafe in the town of Langfuhr, near Danzig, the German students considered the resolution passed by the Polish students at an anti-German demonstration the day before as an insult to Germany. Consequently, the university authorities have, since yesterday, prohibited Polish students from attending classes. The president of the Polish student association immediately protested to the president of the university. At the same time, the Polish diplomatic representative in Danzig also formally protested. (Haitong Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) – According to news from Warsaw, anti-German demonstrations occurred in many parts of Poland today, but none of the country's newspapers mentioned it. German diplomatic officials in Poland also refused to comment. It is reported that many university students in Warsaw held demonstrations in various parts of the city, protesting the current foreign policy of Foreign Minister Beck and marched past the German Embassy, shouting "Down with Germany." A number of members of the right-wing National Unity Party also participated in the demonstrations. In addition, students in Poznan also held demonstrations, demanding the closure of schools run by German expatriates, prohibiting German students from entering Poznan University, and severing private relations with German students.

<p>Warsaw – Italian Foreign Minister Ciano and his wife, accompanied by a large entourage and journalists, arrived here today. According to the planned itinerary, Foreign Minister Ciano will stay in Poland for five days. He will hold talks with government officials here for three days from the 25th to the 27th and attend various banquets. On the 28th, he will go hunting in the Białowieża Forest, and on the 1st of next month, he will visit Krakow for a day. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>Warsaw – Regarding the visit of Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, the local newspapers all say that this trip is purely for goodwill purposes, and that the rapprochement between Italy and Poland is not directed at any other country. Political figures even claim that, in terms of Poland's relationship with France and Italy, Italy is Poland's friend, while France is Poland's ally. Therefore, Poland can only strictly maintain neutrality. "The Warsaw Post" stated that on March 10, 1938, on the eve of Germany's annexation of Austria, Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck was in Rome, holding talks with Foreign Minister Ciano. At that time, the map of Europe had not yet changed. Although both Italy and Poland maintained good neighborly relations with Germany, they did not want to see Germany occupy an excessively dominant position in Europe, which was the reason for their rapprochement. The government-run "Polish Express" stated that after Foreign Minister Ciano's visit, the attitudes of Italy and Poland towards the countries in the Danube River basin and the Balkan Peninsula could be explained. In addition, "The Polish Post" stated that Italy and Poland are cooperating economically to resist Germany's expansion of influence in the Balkan Peninsula. It also said that Foreign Minister Beck had issued a statement in advance, saying that the Mediterranean Sea is far from Poland and does not directly involve Polish interests, to show that Poland is unwilling to intervene in the Franco-Italian dispute.

<p>(Paris) – When the Chamber of Deputies met this afternoon, Prime Minister Daladier delivered a speech, saying, "When the Cabinet holds a State Council meeting on the 27th of this month, I intend to propose recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government as the legitimate government. We have always admired the heroic resistance of the Spanish government army. Now, our country's border is adjacent to the territory of the Spanish Nationalist government for 600 kilometers. Even if the Spanish Republican government continues to resist, unless it receives massive supplies of personnel and armaments, it may not be able to sustain itself for more than a few weeks, let alone win. The President of that country, Azaña, also shares this feeling. It can be seen that the French government's recognition of the Nationalist government is inevitable. Moreover, the British government formally notified our country on the 22nd of this month that the time to recognize the Nationalist government has come and should not be missed. It seems that for the sake of the linked relationship between Britain and France, the French government also has sufficient reason to do so. I dare say that Britain has decided to announce its recognition of the Nationalist government within the next week. Our country can cooperate with it to promote a broad policy and, if necessary, closely monitor the preservation of Spain's independence and sovereignty." In short, the interests that France has in Spain are extremely important. Whether from an international or national standpoint, there is reason to send an official representative to Burgos, Spain, he said. After the Prime Minister finished speaking, members of various left-wing parties, such as Independent Socialist Party member Faucillon, Socialist Party member Etorrain, and Communist Party member Bond, spoke in succession, expressing their opposition. They all said that France should not recognize the Nationalist government until the troops of Germany and Italy withdraw from Spain. Issaurrain also said that when Colonel Louis, the former Nationalist commander of the Spanish island of Majorca, took the British cruiser "Devonshire" to Mahon, Minorca, to discuss a peaceful takeover with the government army authorities, Italian pilots bombed the island, indicating that the Italian troops belonging to the Spanish Nationalist army obeyed the orders of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, not General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist army. At this point, Prime Minister Daladier proposed a vote of confidence, asking to postpone the discussion of the questions raised by members of the left-wing parties. The Chamber immediately voted in favor with 323 votes against 261. Those who voted in favor included 85 members of the Radical Socialist Party, as well as all members of the central and right-wing parties. Those who voted against were all members of the Socialist and Communist parties, 15 members of the Radical Socialist Party, and 12 members of the Independent Socialist Party. In addition, 12 members of the Radical Socialist Party abstained from voting. (Havas Telegraph, 24th)</p>

<p>Maintain Good Relations with Britain and France</p>
<p>Post-War Reconstruction Requires Financial Assistance from Both Countries</p>
<p>(London) – It is widely believed in Britain that the Franco government will be recognized on February 27. British Prime Minister Chamberlain will announce this in Parliament at the same time as French Prime Minister Daladier. The current whereabouts of Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrín are uncertain in London, but it is known that he is near Valencia and will inevitably leave the country sooner or later. According to news received here, the only one in the Republican government who advocates continuing the war is Negrín. It is said that the recognition of Franco will not be subject to conditions, but the exchange of views between British and French representatives Hodgson and Pétain in Burgos with the Nationalist government has clarified everything in a beneficial way. Franco has stated to Hodgson that Mussolini's promise to withdraw troops is being fulfilled. Responsible parties expressed their satisfaction with Franco's intention to have purely Spanish troops occupy Tangier Island. As for retaliation, Franco has repeatedly assured Hodgson that no innocent people will be punished. It is widely believed that Franco, like the French, is eager to maintain good relations between France and Spain. After the end of the Spanish Civil War, Franco will have a long-term task of reconstruction and pacification at home, and no countries have sufficient financial resources to assist Franco more than Britain and France. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) – According to news obtained here, General Franco has given Sir Hodgson, the British representative to the Spanish Nationalist army, a written guarantee regarding the issues of retaliation and the integrity of Spanish territory. It is the general opinion here that the Duke of Alba, who served as General Franco's representative to the UK after the British recognition of the Nationalist government, will naturally be promoted to Spanish Ambassador.

<p>(Paris) – When the Chamber of Deputies met this afternoon, Prime Minister Daladier delivered a speech, announcing that when the Cabinet holds a State Council meeting on the 27th of this month, he would propose recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government as the legitimate government, stating that this move was due to strategic reasons, as the French border is adjacent to the territory of the Spanish Nationalist government for 600 kilometers, and the continued resistance of the Spanish Republican government can only last for a few weeks at most. Under such circumstances, France should establish diplomatic relations with the Nationalist government. Prime Minister Daladier then immediately proposed a vote of confidence, and the Chamber immediately voted in favor with 323 votes against 261. According to responsible parties, Britain and France will simultaneously announce their recognition of the Nationalist government on the 27th of this month. People from the Spanish Republican government here said that once Britain and France officially announce this, the country's President Azaña will resign and leave Paris. (Havas Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) – Spanish Republican President Azaña, currently stationed at the country's embassy, is said to be planning to announce his resignation tomorrow and retire to the town of Collonge-sous-Salève in the Savoie region that evening.

<p>Burgos – After talks between French representative and right-wing Senator Pétain and Nationalist government councilor and Foreign Minister General Jordana, an agreement has been signed, divided into three sections. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>Burgos – After a final decisive talk between the French right-wing senator yesterday with Nationalist government councillor and Foreign Minister General Jordana, he gave a statement that evening to a Havas News Agency interviewer, "I came here on government orders to prepare for the establishment of normal relations between France and the Spanish Nationalist government. This mission has now been completed. I cannot tell you the details of the talks, but I can say that the process and result are both extremely satisfactory. In short, my task was to prepare for the future and resolve various pressing issues." According to well-informed sources, the agreement reached last night between Pétain and General Jordana was deemed satisfactory by both parties. In addition to personally negotiating with Pétain, General Jordana also participated in the drafting of the agreement himself, showing great diligence. As for the final communiqué announcing the results of the negotiations, originally scheduled to be released last night, it has been decided to postpone it until the 27th of this month.</p>
<p>In addition, the resumption of postal, telegraph, road, and railway traffic between France and the Nationalist government's territory will be resolved by experts from both sides. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) – The reason why the French government decided to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government without waiting for Pétain to return to the country is that the recognition was not subject to any conditions. Pétain's mission was limited to resolving various technical issues, such as: (1) The repatriation of Spanish refugees who fled to France; (2) The issue of the disposition of 1,800,000,000 pesetas (Spanish currency) deposited by the Spanish Bank in the Bank of France; (3) The disposition of Spanish ships anchored in French ports and Spanish armaments stored in French territory; (4) The protection of French interests in Spain.

<p>High Hopes for Lilar</p>
<p>(London) – After Britain recognizes the Nationalist government, the British ambassador to the government army's territory will also lose his diplomatic powers. London is now looking for a compromise solution to appoint another diplomatic representative to be stationed in the government army's territory, while the British interests in the government army's territory will be managed by the consulate. The selection of the first British ambassador to Burgos has not yet been determined. It is said that former Aviation Minister Lord Londonderry will be dispatched to Burgos, but it remains to be confirmed. (Haitong Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) – Responsible figures recently declared that after the State Council decides to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government on the 27th of this month, right-wing Senator Pétain (who is in Burgos, negotiating with the Nationalist government authorities) will be appointed as the first ambassador. According to precedent, members of Congress may not be dispatched to other countries for more than six months, but Pétain may resign in April of this year, before the deadline expires, to participate in the general election. (President Lebrun's term will expire in May of this year) (Havas Telegraph, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) – Responsible figures here recently declared that the meaning of the British government's recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government as the legitimate government does not mean recognition of its right as a belligerent party. In other words, the Nationalist government, in theory, still cannot blockade the ports under the Republican government's control. At that time, the Nationalist government will only take the place of the Republican government, so the future relationship between the British government and the Nationalist government will be the same as the relationship that Britain previously maintained with the Republican government. On the other hand, Spain's commitments and obligations to other countries under treaties, especially the treaties related to British Gibraltar, the Algeciras Agreement (regarding the Moroccan issue), the current system of the Tangier International Neutral Port, Spain's foreign debt, and the country's commercial relations with various countries, all of these must also be addressed. Diplomatic circles here generally believe that although the Spanish government may change, the treaties that the country signed before the civil war should continue to be valid. If General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist army, wants to amend any treaty obligations, he must conduct negotiations through normal diplomatic channels. There is reason to believe that the issues that General Franco will raise are nothing more than the new economic system and the resulting situation, which will be similar to the policies implemented by the country's former dictator, General Rivera. As for the rational disposition of foreign funds stored in the country's national bank, those stored in the UK have already been listed, and as soon as the British government recognizes the Nationalist government as the legitimate government, they will be handed over in full.

<p>(London) – Regarding the Palestine issue, political figures here recently declared that the government's current policy is based on the defense interests of the British Empire. Britain intends to open a canal in Palestine, starting from the Mediterranean coast, passing through the Jordan River and the Dead Sea, and reaching the port of Aqaba on the Red Sea, so that if a war occurs in the Mediterranean in the future, even if the Suez Canal is destroyed or blocked, Britain can still maintain maritime traffic with the Far East. The port of Aqaba belongs to Transjordan (a British mandate) and is a small fishing port. In addition, the British government also intends to build a railway from the port of Aqaba to the city of Ma'an (also in Transjordan), which will be connected to the railway from the Mosul region (a famous oil-producing area in Iraq) to Medina (in Hejaz), so that even if the Mosul region's oil pipeline (from the Mosul region to the port of Haifa on the Mediterranean coast) is destroyed, oil can still be transported normally. The above two plans have been studied by experts. Although the cost is huge, the British government, in view of the instability of the international situation, has decided to implement them. Once implemented, the proposal to organize a Arab federation in Palestine and Transjordan will have great strategic significance. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) – According to reliable sources, the British government will announce its policy on the Palestine issue within the next week, the main points of which are as follows: (1) The current British mandate system will continue to be implemented for at least five years, pending a solution to the issue of European Jewish immigration to areas outside of Palestine. (2) Recognition of the right of the Arab community within Palestine to independence. (3) Restrictions on the sale of all Arab-owned land to the Jewish community, preventing its area from exceeding a certain extent. (4) The entire territory of Palestine is divided into three zones, A, B, and C. Zone A prohibits Jewish immigration, Zone B restricts the number of Jewish immigrants, and Zone C allows Jews to immigrate freely within a specified period. (5) The period before the current mandate system is abolished is regarded as a transitional period, during which representatives elected by both the Arab and Jewish communities can participate in the Palestinian Parliament.

<p>(Berlin) German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently published an article in "The Observer" titled "Is War Not Far Off?", which stated in brief: "Anyone who pays slight attention to recent foreign newspapers can get the impression that a second world war is about to break out in Europe. However, judging from the speech made by the Führer Hitler in the Reichstag, although he still put forward colonial demands, fair-minded people would not find fault with this. Now the situation in Spain has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and those familiar with the matter need not be surprised. This is dictated by the reality of the European situation. Now democratic countries are shouting for war and are openly asking their people to prepare for military expansion in order to cope with the attacks of totalitarian countries. According to this, who is provoking the war, Germany or the democratic countries?" (Haitong Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official "International Relations" magazine recently criticized Britain and France and involved the United States, but the tone was still moderate. It said that if the three countries of Britain, France, and the United States did not continue the spirit of the Munich Agreement and satisfy the demands made by Germany and Italy, then if a war unfortunately occurred, the three countries would bear the responsibility. "Germany and Italy, starting from a new spirit of movement, have put forward a number of demands. The meaning of this is nothing more than hoping that the strength of the two countries will not be bound by narrow boundaries, but will establish a new balance. This is really a matter of course, and the solution is to satisfy them on the colonial issue. This plan was extremely simple and did not violate humanity. However, Britain and France, with the help of the United States, intensified their military expansion and controlled various raw materials in order to achieve their war-mongering goals and not allow other countries to share their interests. This is enough to cause war. However, the Axis of Germany and Italy will never retreat. If war unfortunately breaks out, Germany and Italy will face it with great perseverance, which will also amaze the enemy countries. For the sake of Britain and France, if they want to avoid great disappointment, it is best to recognize the sacred rights possessed by the Italian and German nations in material and spiritual matters. Otherwise, the all-powerful countries will have to deal with each other with powerful forces. Continuing in this way will inevitably lead to war," he said. (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e42">Saving One Yuan Can Educate a Refugee for One Semester. German Government Revises Income Tax Regulations to Eliminate the Gap Between Rich and Poor, Implies Encouragement of Childbearing <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) In order to speed up the completion of its four-year economic plan and achieve national self-sufficiency, the German National Socialist government today increased the people's taxes. It is said that this tax increase is aimed at eliminating the gap between the rich and the poor, so the middle class and those with rich incomes will be more affected. For the middle class, the average annual income tax is US$40, and those with richer incomes will pay even more. At the same time, General Göring ordered German Jews to sell all their gold, silver, and jewelry to government-designated locations. (Associated Press Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The government recently promulgated revised income tax regulations effective from the 1939 fiscal year, stipulating that single people and those who have been married for five years without children should pay high income tax rates. The income tax of single people was already higher than that of married people, and now it has been increased by 25%, a difference of 44% compared with the tax paid by married people. However, if a person has been married for five years without children, the tax increase should be 21%, which is still slightly lower than that of a single person. Conversely, the more children a person has, the lower the income tax rate they pay. German authorities have explained this decree, saying that people with children need education and maintenance expenses and cannot bear high tax rates, so they should be shared by single people and those without children in order to provide support and show fairness. It is reported that as a result of this tax increase, Germany's income tax revenue can reach 200,000,000 marks this year and 300,000,000 marks next year. (Haitong Telegram, 5th)</p>

However, the members of the House of Representatives gathered tonight and decided by a vote of 109 to 47 that they would not take any action on the government's declaration within two days, so the cabinet crisis will not occur within a few days.

<p>(Washington) The Senate today passed a bill extending the life of the Export-Import Bank to June 30, 1941. This bill will play an important role in the United States' efforts to exclude commercial interests of combined powers in South America, because the extension of the bank's life may make it possible to increase loans to China. In addition, the Senate has also passed a bill to extend the life of the Product Credit Cooperative to June 30, 1941. It is expected that these two bills have now been sent to the White House for signature by President Roosevelt. (Associated Press Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to Republican Congressman Crawford, who opposes the defense of Guam, the United States must first consider its overall policy toward the Far East before defending Guam, especially its policy toward the Philippines and other democratic countries. "Since our national policy is based on isolation, and we will soon withdraw from the Philippines, what is the use of spending another $5 million to defend Guam? Furthermore, after we withdraw from the Philippines, Japan's economic power will inevitably invade the Philippines, and its political power will also enter the Philippines later. What is the use?" Crawford's tone was not absolutely opposed to the defense of Guam, but advocated that the United Kingdom's national policy toward the Far East should be determined first.

<p>US, Des Moines US Secretary of Commerce Hopkins delivered his first policy speech here tonight at the Red Club, advocating the development of six procedures to revitalize US businesses based on the intention of creating an environment to encourage private investment: (1) Not generally increasing central taxes, but revising taxes that may hinder the flow of capital; (2) Breaking down obstacles to private investment in public utilities, railways, and real estate; (3) Labor should be patient and fair when dealing with capital; (4) Increasing national income should seek arrangements for the unemployed and formulate a balanced budget; (5) Providing assistance to small businesses; (6) Farmers should enjoy a larger share of the national income. (Reuters, 24th) Hopkins also said that the US government has shifted its policy focus from "new" to "revival" and intends to use all its strength to promote its success. The government is willing to cooperate with the business community, and the authorities are eager to create an atmosphere that encourages private investment. The government does not intend to adopt a patent policy for public utilities, so as to open the door to investment. (Reuters Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) German Führer Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop exchanged congratulatory telegrams with Hungary and "Manchukuo," which had newly joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. In addition to commenting on this matter, Berlin newspapers also said that Spanish General Franco would also join the pact, and the efforts of Western countries to dissuade Franco from joining the pact had failed. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The political circles here attach great importance to the joining of "Manchukuo" and Hungary to the Anti-Comintern Pact. It is generally believed that other countries will continue to join, so as to establish an international anti-communist office and start organizing an international association of the "Anti-League of Nations." Well-informed sources here said that Germany has contacted the Czech Republic and Poland, urging them to join the Anti-Comintern Pact, but Poland may not comply. In addition, although Hungary has joined the pact, it has also dissolved the National Socialist Party, and it is not known how it will justify itself. German political circles do not comment on this. (Havas Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Budapest Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky signed the Anti-Comintern Pact today. Afterwards, Csáky said that Hungary's joining the pact was not only the result of its 20 years of struggle against communism, but also a symbol of Hungary's sincere friendship with Germany, Italy, and Japan. Since 1919, Hungary has been engaged in resisting the potential of communism in international affairs. The current Anti-Comintern Pact is not detrimental to any country, but only a method of self-defense to prevent undue interference in the internal affairs of the signatory countries. The Communist Party is international in nature, its methods of activity are diverse, and it is also powerful, so only cooperation between countries can prevent its activities. The German Ambassador to Hungary delivered a speech welcoming Hungary's joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, believing that this is a sign of Hungary's friendly relations and common interests with Germany, Italy, and Japan. Hungary, in history, has been the mainstay of order and peace. It is gratifying to maintain its historical position faithfully and join the struggle to prevent the destructive work of the Communist Party. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to the German government tonight, the issue of the Hungarian government dissolving the country's National Socialist Party is purely an internal affair of the country. According to Hungarian diplomats in advance, most believed that the dissolution of Hungary's "Green Shirt Team" would not affect German-Hungarian relations. Judging from the German statement, this observation has indeed been proven correct. At the same time, many aspects of Germany also believe that since Hungary has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, the dissolution of the "Green Shirt Team" is in fact of no importance.

<h3 id="e53">Tung Oil Exports to the United States, Trade Ups and Downs, War Affects Transportation, Market Prices Fluctuate <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Havas News Agency, New York Shipping News Tung oil is a major commodity that has recently emerged in the international market, especially in trade between China and the United States. Recently, the "Commercial Daily" here published an article on the ups and downs of tung oil trade between China and the United States, saying that "Since the outbreak of war between China and Japan, tung oil produced in China has been extremely difficult to import into the United States due to transportation, and oil prices have gradually soared. As a result, the tung oil industry in the states along the Gulf of Mexico in the United States, namely Florida and Louisiana, has tried to step up production. According to the early years of this century, the above-mentioned states began to plant tung trees and test the oil extraction industry. After decades of development, this oil industry has made great progress, but the output is still limited and insufficient to meet domestic demand, so it has given it to China for many years, and it has increased year by year. The peak was in 1937, when China imported a total of 175,000,000 pounds of tung oil into the United States, while the United States produced the most in last year (1938), but it was only 4,000,000 pounds, and the difference between supply and demand is very far. According to this observation, it can be known that in the next few years, the tung oil market in the United States will still need to purchase a large amount from China. There is no doubt that in terms of the situation of Americans planting tung trees, in the early stage, they did not know what was suitable for soil texture, tung tree species, and climate dryness and wetness, so the losses were very large. Until last year, the planted tung trees began to flourish. At present, the oil price is gradually falling, which is completely dependent on the situation in China. In the past two years, due to the war, the rise and fall has been even greater. In November 1937, after the Japanese army occupied Shanghai, the source of tung oil was cut off for a time, and the market price soared to 22 cents per pound. Later, due to the large number of tung oil exports from Hong Kong, the oil price fell. Until Guangzhou fell in October last year, it rose back to 15 cents. Since then, the oil price has hovered between 12 cents and 15 cents. The United States currently has sufficient inventory. Whether the market price can be stabilized in the future depends on whether China's exports can be transported smoothly through the Yunnan-Burma Highway and whether the export volume can be adjusted appropriately. Otherwise, the rise and fall cannot be predicted. However, since tung oil freight has increased and delivery has not been on schedule, most of the original users of tung oil have switched to other types of oil. Even in terms of paint, the amount of tung oil used has been greatly reduced." (Havas Telegram, 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e56">Japan Declares Decision on Shanghai Concession Incident in Tokyo <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>It is not yet clear what steps will be taken</p>
<p>A Shanghai Zilin Daily reporter in Tokyo reported on February 22 that after the Japanese Minister of the Army, Minister of the Navy, and Minister of Foreign Affairs spoke in the Diet yesterday, reporters met with spokespersons from both the Army and Navy provinces today. Judging from the spokespersons' remarks, Japan clearly intends to take a tough stance regarding the actions of Chinese assassins in the Shanghai Public Concession. It seems that the Japanese side will either demand that complete control of the foreign police affairs of Shanghai be transferred to them, or demand that the Japanese Navy or the headquarters of the military police maintain order throughout the Public Concession, or tighten control over all Chinese entering and leaving the two concessions. It has not yet been decided. The three provinces of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs are currently holding meetings to consider the proposals made by the Japanese authorities in Shanghai. It is expected that a decision will be made soon. According to Colonel Mizuno, acting spokesperson for the Navy Province, to reporters, the Shanghai Public Concession's Municipal Council and its police department either lack sincerity or are incapable of preventing such murders. Japan is extremely indignant about this. They have not even captured one of the criminals who commit such cowardly acts even in broad daylight. It is almost unbelievable that with police officers stationed everywhere, they cannot easily capture these criminals. Furthermore, the outrage continues to occur despite repeated requests from the Japanese side to the Municipal Council to take adequate precautions to prevent such crimes. If the Municipal Council and its police department are both incapable, then others must take control of the situation. It cannot be allowed to continue as it is today, and strong steps must be taken. When the reporter asked if the strong action meant that the Japanese marines would take over the remaining part of the Public Concession, i.e., the south bank of the Suzhou River, the spokesperson replied that while he could not answer definitively, it was possible. He added that most of these crimes do indeed occur in the Public Concession, but the assassins may be hiding in the French Concession. This point is not yet certain, but it is certain that even in the past, the French Concession was a hotbed of conspirators, assassins, and political offenders. They come from all parts of China and hide there. According to Major Akiyama, acting spokesperson for the Army Province, to reporters this afternoon, after a series of assassinations of prominent Chinese, it seems that an impossible situation exists in the Shanghai Public Concession that cannot be allowed to continue. As for what steps will be taken to make a decision, it is impossible for them to say today, but representatives from the Army Province are currently discussing with representatives from the Navy and Foreign Affairs provinces, and it is hoped that a direction for action will be decided in the near future, perhaps in a day or two. Regarding the accidental bombing by Japanese army aircraft of British territory within the Kowloon leased territory boundary near Shenzhen at 10 o'clock yesterday morning, Major Akiyama said that the Army Province has already instructed the Japanese Consul General in Hong Kong to apologize to the Hong Kong authorities for this mistake. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, it was able to use the Pearl River for transportation, so the area no longer had special uses and has been abandoned. However, Chinese guerrillas began to use it to connect with British territory and gather in the area, so the Japanese army decided that this was to bomb them and make them leave. During the bombing, a shell accidentally fell on British territory and hit a locomotive, injuring some people. He predicted that these damages would be compensated within a reasonable period of time. An spokesperson at the British Embassy also told reporters today that Britain attaches great importance to this matter. Embassy Counselor Dodd has already lodged a formal protest with Foreign Minister Arita yesterday and has not yet received a reply. An acting spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized the killings of Chinese in the Shanghai Public Concession this morning, stating emphatically that 17 assassinations have occurred in succession, and although we have made requests, the police department has not yet captured a single person. All evidence shows that the Japanese side's repeated protests have been ineffective. It can be seen that although the police department may be trying to apprehend the murderers, they are completely incapable. Therefore, the Japanese government is now considering what appropriate measures must be taken to deal with this situation.</p>

<p>Bai Chongxi Talks in Kunming</p>
<p>Special Correspondence from Yunnan General Bai Jiansheng is a famous general of the Guangxi Province. He is highly knowledgeable in military affairs and has been very active in the current war of resistance, making great contributions. On February 3, he flew to Yunnan by special plane from Chongqing at 11:00 a.m., accompanied by his chief staff officer Wang Zemin and staff secretary adjutant, etc. After hearing the news, the reporter immediately went to visit him and received his consent to publish his remarks as follows. This decision was made in Chongqing after participating in the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. It was at the time when the War of Resistance entered the second phase, and the front-line war situation was in a transitional period, which was slightly calmer than before. Therefore, he took time to visit Chairman Long and also because he was responsible for the military training minister, he would also inspect the education of troops and military schools and national military training. He was also commissioned by Chairman Chiang to inspect the Air Force Officer School. The result of the Fifth Plenary Session was extremely satisfactory, and everyone spoke freely in the meeting, giving full play to the democratic spirit of the Three Principles of the People. Mr. Wu Zhihui once said that the success of this meeting was unprecedented in our party, which fully demonstrates that sincere unity has indeed been achieved. As for the war situation in the southwest, the recent surface seems to be serious, but from a military point of view, in today's situation where the Japanese are beset with crises and strong from the outside but weak from the inside, if they want to open a battlefield in the southwest, it is actually not allowed by the facts. Moreover, our preparation is extremely strong, so how can they not know? The rumors that Japan wants to invade the south or the west are all words of propaganda and intimidation. We only need to have firm faith to deal with it.</p>

Before the Lunar New Year, winter defense was important, and it was said that he needed to understand the actual situation of the administration of various districts in order to conduct an examination. Therefore, last week, he led important officials such as Mr. Hong to inspect various places. The inspection of various districts in the eastern township was thorough, and the people enthusiastically welcomed him wherever he went. County Chief Ping cared about the people's livelihood and inquired in great detail. When he arrived at a certain district, he heard that the eastern township had been disturbed by local ruffians Lu Yongfang, Zhang Youguang, and Lu Asan. He immediately ordered District Self-Defense Battalion Commander Guo to lead the team to suppress them. He arrested Lu Yongfang, Lu Asan, Zhang Youguang, etc., and interrogated them overnight. They confessed to the facts. In addition to pursuing the remaining accomplices, they were immediately executed and their bodies were beheaded and displayed to the public.</p>

It was also resolved to promote lower-level autonomy in the various guerrilla areas in order to achieve the goal of cooperation between the military and civilians, to control food exports, and to ban the import of Japanese goods in order to prevent leakage and benefit the war of resistance. Gu was also deeply concerned that the various teams under his command might not be able to implement it effectively, so he went to various lines to inspect and inquired about the daily situation of his subordinates from the local people in order to prepare for rectification. It is said that the results of this trip were very good, so the morale was higher than before, and more patriotic people abandoned their businesses to join the army. Moreover, the women of Jiaxing have already formed a women's team and started training, and their strength will be very great when they serve on the battlefield in the future. However, recently, there have been bandits impersonating guerrilla teams in Jiaxing, who often extort the people, which is very hateful. Gu therefore ordered the troops under his command to pacify the bandits as soon as possible, and those who can be pacified will be pacified. Those who are willing to be accomplices of the enemy will be exterminated in order to relieve the people's suffering.</p>

Near Dujia Lane in Qingpu County, two of the trucks were intercepted by the guerrillas of the × Unit stationed there. Mr. Zhuang, who was escorting the trucks, was taken to the unit for interrogation. However, he spoke evasively and no clear information was obtained.

<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: Shengang Town, located eighteen li west of the city, has the tomb of Wu Jiza from the Spring and Autumn Period. The shrine's origin can be traced back to the Jiayou era of the Song Dynasty when the exiled prefect Zhu Yan, based on historical records of Wu Jizi's tomb being west of Shengang, visited the site and built the tomb. The Jizi tomb in Danyang only contains his clothing and cap, while the tomb in Shengang definitely contains his remains. After the tomb was completed, the Jizi Shrine was built. From the Song Dynasty to the present, it has been repaired multiple times. The shrine had a main hall, east and west side halls, guest rooms, the Plum Blossom Academy, and a three-bay main gate. In the center was a ten-character inscription personally written by Confucius in seal script: "Alas, here lies the tomb of the gentleman Yanling of Wu." A wooden pavilion was built to protect it. Zheng Deng, an imperial censor of the Ming Dynasty, wrote a couplet: "The stars and the moon are cold at night by the gentleman's tomb," "Wind and thunder protect the sage's writing." Previously, in the Gengshen year of the Tongzhi reign, Peng Yulin visited the shrine and personally painted four plum blossoms, which were engraved on the walls. Many people made rubbings of them. In the 14th year of the Republic of China, Wu Peng, the magistrate of Jiangyin County, gathered craftsmen and materials to extensively repair the shrine, giving it a new look. Since the full length of the Zhencheng Road was opened to traffic in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, Wu Zhihui, a prominent figure in the Kuomintang, personally visited the Jizi Shrine to study ancient history and compile the genealogy of the Wu clan and also photographed the shrine. The photos were included in the genealogy. The Jizi Shrine was indeed one of the ancient sites of Jiangyin. During the outbreak of the War of Resistance against Japan, troops were stationed in the shrine multiple times. When Jiangyin City was occupied by the Japanese army, the shrine was the first to be ravaged. A few days ago, a fire suddenly broke out, destroying everything. Most heartbreakingly, the ten-character inscription by Confucius and the plum blossom stone engravings by Peng Gangzhi were reduced to ashes. Only a mound of yellow earth remains of the Jizi tomb.</p>

<h3 id="e63">International Settlement's Defense Strict, Public Morale Greatly Stabilized <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Iron Wire Nets Deployed in Lanes of Nanjing Road, Patrols and British Troops Deploying in Sections</p>
<p>Stock Exchange Market Prices Remain Steady for Days</p>
<p>The Public Settlement Police Department, considering Nanjing Road the most prosperous commercial area in the whole district, is increasing defense since yesterday to prevent disturbances by undesirable elements. At each dock along the Bund and the Huangpu River, two British soldiers and Chinese police officers are stationed, and all persons entering and exiting ships are being searched. Nanjing Road, from the Bund to Yu Qiaqing Road, has all its north and south lanes leading to pedestrian walkways blocked off. Craftsmen are setting up iron wire nets, and even Hongmiao Lane, usually quite busy, has been blocked. One or two Chinese police officers are stationed at each lane entrance. Nanjing Road is a mile long and only the north-south longitudinal Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Henan Road, Shandong Road, Shanxi Road, Fujian Road, Zhejiang Road, Yinghua Street, Guangxi Road, Guizhou Road, Yunnan Road, Lloyd Road, etc. remain open for normal traffic. Other lanes that have been blocked include Zhili Road (commonly known as Hongmiao Lane), Cifeng East Lane, Cifeng West Lane, Wufu Lane, Xiangfen Lane, Ciyong Lane, Longquanyuan Lane, Rixin Lane, Deyu Lane, Daqing Lane, Yuxing Lane, Jixian Lane, and Lane 361. Those with existing iron gate installations are closed all day and have not been fitted with wire nets. Nangao Yangli and Dexinfang are not blocked, and neither are their non-through lanes. The Buddha Street below the Cishu Building, as well as Bao'anfang and Guanqunfang and two streets, have wooden barricades already in place and thus have not been blocked. Residents of all blocked lanes must enter and exit through the back of the lanes. The precautions are quite strict. Other lanes connecting two roads, or those that are small and remote, or those that can access all four sides, have been fitted with wooden posts wrapped in iron wire nets, allowing only one-way traffic.</p>
<p>Shanghai Consulates in Close Contact</p>
<p>Regarding the Japanese side's protests to the Public Settlement twice, using "terrorist incidents" as a pretext to expand Japanese power within the Shanghai Municipal Council, sources state that the Municipal Council is carefully studying the matter in meetings and is in close contact with the consuls of the major powers in the Public Settlement, such as Britain and the United States. Each consul has sought instructions from their respective governments. The Japanese demands to the Municipal Council, using "terrorist incidents" as a pretext, are roughly a continuation of the demands made on January 4th of last year, but the scope is slightly larger and they desire immediate implementation. The Municipal Council will respond to the Japanese side shortly, maintaining its existing policies and striving to maintain order within the Settlement.</p>
<p>State of Unease Eliminated</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that on Thursday (the 23rd) evening, the Public Settlement police cooperated with over three hundred members of the White Russian Merchant Corps to conduct a large-scale search in the central district, unseen for months. The rooftop garden of the Sincere Company and the East Asia Hotel were inspected, and three people were arrested and taken to the police station. Unable to find any crime they had committed, they were released yesterday (the 24th) at noon. When the three were arrested, papers containing Chairman Chiang's speech given in Chongqing on December 16th of last year were seized, but no other incriminating documents were found, nor were others arrested. During the search, each member of the police force searched the people, and every room in the hotel was thoroughly examined. The White Russian Merchant Corps blocked pedestrians from approaching the building during the search, while countless curious pedestrians on the opposite side of Nanjing Road stopped to watch. At the same time, authorities are diligently working on defense. The Bund has temporarily had no patrols for months, or at least the patrols had been reduced to a minimum. Now, patrols in groups of two or three have been increased. Patrols of the West Yorkshire Regiment of the British Army, equipped with light machine guns, patrol Nanjing Road almost every afternoon. Armored trucks of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps, carrying the White Russian Merchant Corps, continue to patrol various parts of the Public Settlement. Patrols are particularly close in the western district, with mobile patrol teams continuing to patrol Great Western Road, Route Tenant de la Tour, and Robison Road, especially at night, because most recent shootings have occurred in those areas, which border the area controlled by the "Reformed Government" and are the hiding places for increasingly rampant criminals, even those who snipe at patrol officers. In short, the increasing unease of this port for the past few days now seems greatly stabilized, because the Shanghai Stock Exchange market prices, which many regard as an accurate barometer, have remained steady. Some prices have even risen a few pounds sterling in the past day or two. Regular patrols are seen around the areas defended by American and Italian forces. For the past few days, two U.S. Marines have been stationed at the corner of Jing'an Temple Road and Yu Qiaqing Road, equipped with a military telephone. French Concession police have also been active recently, with search teams busily inspecting vehicles and pedestrians and confiscating weapons day and night at various points in the French Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Political Assassinations Seem Temporarily Suspended <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Speculation by a Senior Police Officer</p>
<p>Continued Assassinations Would Greatly Affect the Public</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that a senior police officer told reporters yesterday (the 24th) that there would be no political assassinations in this port for the time being. He made this statement based on his belief in the intelligence and wisdom of the Chinese people, because if political assassinations continued, the Chinese people who currently enjoy protection and residence rights in the Public Settlement would suffer greatly. No police force in the world can prevent political assassinations, especially in a city where residents sympathize with the assassins. While the Japanese may genuinely feel that the Public Settlement Police Department cannot be held accountable, Japanese public opinion may force them to take reckless and drastic measures, and they may also realize that such measures are meaningless and would be detrimental to themselves. If the Japanese take such steps, all residents of the city will suffer greatly, especially the Chinese. If the perpetrators study the habits of the victims, and the victims are unaware of the precautions and still appear before the perpetrators, then such assassinations cannot be prevented, because three people have been killed each day at the same time while riding in rickshaws on the same road. Investigating after the assassination is futile. In ordinary assassinations, it is possible to investigate the motives of the crime with suspects, and the police department's speculation is accurate six or seven times out of ten, but in political assassinations, the scope of suspects is vast, because anyone among the countless Chinese in Shanghai may have the motivation to encourage such acts. The police officer's statement is based on reliable information from the guerrilla areas downstream of the Yangtze River, which states that political assassinations are bound to occur in that area. Assassins are very active in Wuxi, where an average of five assassinations occur every day. The Japanese army frequently closes the city gates and searches house to house, but the assassins are active again the next day. It is rumored that several political assassinations have occurred in the Public Settlement north of the Suzhou Creek, but this has not been confirmed.</p>

<p>Japanese Side Falsely Claims They Are Guerrillas</p>
<p>German Consulate Will Continue Serious Negotiations</p>
<p>The German ship Feikang of the Rulun Trading Company in this city was suddenly detained by a Japanese warship at 7 AM the day before yesterday, outside the Wusongkou Dinghai Island sea area, while sailing from Shanghai to Wenzhou. It was searched for three hours, and four Chinese passengers were arrested. The details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. According to inquiries made by reporters from the Modern News Agency with the company yesterday, the company immediately reported the incident to the German Consulate General in Shanghai after it occurred, requesting serious negotiations and demanding the release of the arrested passengers. The German Consulate immediately lodged an oral protest with Japanese Consul Miura after receiving the report, but the four passengers had not been released as of yesterday. The German Consulate must wait until the German shipowner, Mr. Kebei, submits a detailed report of the incident to the consulate before it can lodge a formal protest. A Japanese spokesperson claimed that the four arrested Chinese were guerrillas, but the German side absolutely denied this, which is obviously a false accusation by the Japanese.</p>

<p>Flood Situation Remains Severe, Expectations for Spring Relief and Work Relief Are High</p>
<p>The Subei International Relief Committee, in order to facilitate the handling of Subei flood relief work, has established branch committees in counties with churches or Western residents, appointing Chinese and Western personnel. In early this month, Yuan Xiaogu, deputy director of the general affairs group of the committee, and inspectors Zhi Ligeng and Bai visited various counties in Subei to promote this work and negotiate the establishment of branch committees. The Shanghai office of the committee has received a letter from Yuan and Feng from Huai'an, stating: "Branch committees in Taixian and Xinghua have been decided to be established. The number of disaster victims identified by the branch committees and the amount of relief funds requested are indeed extremely accurate. During our trip to the north, we saw that although the water has receded slightly, the embankments are still deeply submerged in the water. Ships sail over them, appearing to be on the sea, and it is impossible to distinguish the riverbank. The sowing of the two wheats has already been missed, and many houses are still submerged. In addition to winter relief, expectations for spring relief and work relief are even higher. We hope to continue to raise funds to alleviate the suffering." (Omitted below)</p>
<h3 id="e67">Japanese Interference in Foreign Ships Transporting Grain Resolved After Negotiations <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Side Voluntarily Withdraws the Permit Issuance Method</p>
<p>But Still Uses Special Power to Deliberately Obstruct</p>
<p>After Japanese Consul Miura in Shanghai, citing the fake order of the "New Reformed Government," notified the consulates of various countries and interfered with foreign ships loading and transporting grain, the consulates paid great attention to this case. All believed that the Japanese action clearly infringed upon the rights and interests of foreign merchants, so they prepared to lodge a serious protest. At the same time, after direct negotiations between various foreign shipping companies and the Japanese troops stationed along the river, a temporary solution has been reached. The details of the process are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Direct Negotiations by Various Shipping Companies</p>
<p>After the Japanese side used the pretext to prohibit the loading and transportation of grain, various foreign shipping companies, in addition to reporting the details to their respective consulates to protest, also directly negotiated with the Japanese troops stationed along the river at Changyinsha, Hupu, and other places, led by Jardine Matheson, Butterfield &amp; Swire, Chinese-Italian Trading Company, and German Reiss &amp; Co., as well as Norwegian and Portuguese companies. As a result, the Japanese method of "all ships of third countries loading and transporting grain must be approved by the 'New Reformed Government' and issued a permit before being allowed to load, transport, and sail" has been voluntarily withdrawn. However, before the grain is loaded for export, it must be guaranteed that the grain to be loaded can only be transported to Shanghai and is not allowed to be transferred to other ports. It is now learned that the authorities of the various shipping companies have submitted the details of the resolution to their respective consulates for review and handling.</p>
<p>Imposing Harsh Regulations on Procuring Grain</p>
<p>The Japanese side's attempt to control river transport and squeeze out foreign merchants' business, after the foreign shipping companies reasoned with them, has outwardly allowed foreign ships to freely load and transport goods, but in reality, it has implemented various means to invisibly hit foreign shipping. The method is to use the fake organization to require the owner or freight customer to report to the local Japanese puppet "agency" in advance to obtain "removal permits" and "import permits" for various goods entering and exiting, in order to use this fake evidence as a tool to create various difficulties and cause foreign shipping companies to suffer losses and voluntarily suspend their business. On the one hand, it is also forcing merchants to load Japanese ships. According to people from the mainland, the various transshipment companies along the river have been meeting for days to discuss jointly protesting to the Japanese puppets.</p>
<p>Various Grain Merchants Temporarily Suspend Loading</p>
<p>Because the Japanese puppets have implemented various goods import and export permits, various grain merchants are unwilling to transport the grain that has been purchased in previous years to the river to load ships for Shanghai, in order to avoid accidental losses. Therefore, although the Shanghai grain market has opened since the 24th of this month, the daily transactions of grain are all from the warehouse, and the domestic rice has not yet opened.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that a Japanese transport ship carrying thirty-seven foreigners from Guling is expected to arrive in Shanghai this afternoon (the 25th) or early tomorrow morning (the 26th). The ship left Jiujiang on Thursday morning and reportedly left Nanjing yesterday. If it sails normally, it is expected to arrive today.

<p>After Pan Gongzhan was appointed Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, members of the education community in this city telegraphed their congratulations the day before yesterday. Various national goods organizations in this city believe that Pan has made many contributions to social undertakings over the years. He is now appointed Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department, and he will certainly be able to serve the country with pleasure. Yesterday, they jointly sent a letter to Huang Yanpei and Hu Xiyuan in Chongqing, asking them to represent all national goods organizations in Shanghai in expressing their congratulations to Pan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Factory Federation yesterday telegraphed former Social Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan, congratulating him on his appointment as Deputy Minister of the Central Propaganda Department. The message read: "Respectful greetings to Mr. Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Minister of the Propaganda Department of the Central Committee in Chongqing.

<p>According to a person who came to Shanghai from Luodian Town on the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus route yesterday, in addition to the guerrillas already scattered along the Jinghu Railway and the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, the guerrillas' tracks have recently expanded to the Shanghai-Taicang long-distance bus route. Because the Japanese soldiers are few in number and tired of dealing with the guerrillas, they once left the town (referring to Luodian Town) for five or six days. Now, the area along the route is under the control of the guerrillas.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily News reports that the residents of Yangshupu and Hongkew were awakened by loud rifle fire yesterday morning (the 24th). The gunfire started around 3 AM and lasted for two hours. It seemed to be coming from between Shanghai and Wusong. According to residents of the area, the gunfire stopped around 5 AM. Observers in the area saw two trucks of Japanese soldiers covered in mud passing through the streets around 7 AM, heading towards the barracks. Although there is no official news about this, it is likely that the guerrillas are active. Residents of Yangshupu and Hongkew further stated that the gunfire was loud and only occasionally interrupted.</p>

<p>Japanese Planes Bomb and Reconnoiter Zhejiang</p>
<p>Salt Stored in Haimen Has Been Transported to the Rear</p>
<p>Since the Japanese warships' attempt to land in Haimen, Zhejiang failed, they have blockaded Jiaojiang, hindering the passage of foreign ships. Japanese warships still patrol outside Haimen, and Japanese planes fly over various parts of Eastern Zhejiang for reconnaissance and bombing. The situation in Eastern Zhejiang remains tense, and the precautions taken by the Chinese army are even stricter. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Patrol the Blockaded Jiaojiang</p>
<p>The Japanese warships have blockaded Jiaojiang outside Haimen, and have built a blockade by sinking gravel sailboats, marked with bamboo poles. Although the bamboo pole signals have been destroyed by our army, it will be difficult to achieve the passage of Jiaojiang in the short term. The German ship Feikang, when passing through Jiaojiang on its way from Wenzhou to Shanghai the other day, saw two Japanese warships patrolling in the distance. As for the waters of Dinghai, Yueqing, and Putuo, Japanese warships are occasionally found patrolling, so the situation in Eastern Zhejiang remains serious.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Reconnoiter and Bomb Zhejiang</p>
<p>Japanese planes occasionally fly over various parts of Eastern Zhejiang for reconnaissance and bombing. On the morning of the 22nd, five Japanese planes flew into Zhaobaoshan in Zhenhai and dropped three bombs, destroying one house. They also dropped a bomb on Dinghai Island, but there was no loss. Yesterday, six Japanese planes flew over Zhuji, Jinhua, and Ningbo in Eastern Zhejiang for reconnaissance. Since February 18, Japanese planes have occasionally flown over various parts of Eastern Zhejiang. Most of the bombs they dropped have landed in barren areas, so there has been no major loss in Eastern Zhejiang. The air raid alarm equipment in Eastern Zhejiang is becoming increasingly complete.</p>
<p>Salt Stored in Haimen Transported to the Rear</p>
<p>The reporter of the New Sound News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the Japanese warships' attempt to land in Haimen was reportedly based on a report from a Chinese traitor, stating that there was salt waiting to be loaded and transported to the coastal defense. Since the landing failed, they blockaded Jiaojiang to prevent the salt from being loaded and exported. However, our side had already transported the salt from Haimen to a certain place in the rear. Currently, there is no salt in Haimen, and Haimen is not a salt-producing area. As for the precautions in Haimen, they remain strict to prevent Japanese warships from landing again.</p>
<p>Strict Precautions in Coastal Areas of Eastern Zhejiang</p>
<p>The coastal areas of Eastern Zhejiang, such as Ningbo and Haimen, as well as Jiaojiang, Yongjiang, and Oujiang, had already been ordered by Commander-in-Chief Liu of the Tenth Army Group to be prepared by the two garrison commanders of Wenzhou-Taizhou and Ningbo, who deployed defense projects and stationed heavy troops. In order to maintain the export of local goods, Ningbo and Wenzhou ports are temporarily allowed to open for traffic. Since the Haimen incident, in order to prevent Chinese traitors from mixing into the mainland, foreign ships must first anchor in the heart of the river before being allowed to dock after being strictly inspected by the military police.</p>

<p>And Designating This Year as Cloth Clothing Year, Meeting to Discuss Promotion Methods Within Days</p>
<p>The Cloth Clothing Association, organized by the business, industrial, and academic circles of this city, aims to promote the wearing of cloth clothing and practice thrift. Its purpose is pure, and its intention is profound. Since its launch, people throughout Shanghai have responded enthusiastically. The association has received a mountain of membership application letters in recent days. Because the association does not charge any fees, applicants only need to swear to wear cloth clothing and fill out an application form. However, due to the limitations of the association's constitution, it has not been able to accommodate everyone, which is deeply regrettable. It is now learned that the association has decided to expand its current organization in response to requests from various parties. In the future, there will be no limit on the number of applicants. The association has also decided to actively promote the cloth clothing movement from now on and designate this year as cloth clothing year. In addition to sending letters to all public and private schools, shops, and factories in the city for unanimous assistance, it is also heard that leaders from all circles will be invited to gather within days to discuss promotion methods.</p>
<h3 id="e76">The Western District as a Den of Iniquity: Rampant Terrorist Cases <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Assassination Incidents Are an Inevitable Consequence</p>
<p>Armed Fights Over Land Have No Political Nature</p>
<p>Mainland newspapers report that terrorist incidents are rampant in the Western District, with several pseudo-police, spies, and other thugs killed. However, contrary to what the Japanese side claims, these cases have no political nature. Yesterday (the 24th), according to sources in the local police, these assassinations are an inevitable result of the development along the roads outside the Western District concession. The Western District is a "crime zone," as recently evidenced by the frequent</p>
<p>Thug Fights</p>
<p>In the first half of this month, sixteen new opium dens were opened in the area outside the concession roads. They all applied for registration to the Japanese advisor of the "Shanghai Municipal Government" and the person in charge of the uncompleted opium monopoly. As far as is known, they have not yet been approved. Therefore, these opium dens cannot obtain "black goods" from other sources and have to resort to</p>
<p>Private Opium Smugglers. Regarding this matter, a certain Chinese director of the Opium Den Association (whose name is best kept undisclosed here) made a deal with the Japanese advisor of the pseudo-"Shanghai Municipal Government" in mid-January. Both parties agreed that the Association (located at No. 19 Route des Soeurs, Astor House) would purchase at least 100,000 yuan worth of opium per month for three months, and the Japanese advisor would then supply the opium. The director of the Association agreed to distribute the opium to various opium dens. However, he was not satisfied with obtaining this</p>
<p>Monopoly in the Western District and refused to sell opium to opium dens that were not members of the Association. Only thirteen of the eighteen opium dens in the Western District are members of the Association, so the remaining five had no goods to sell and had to buy privately smuggled opium. However, the director did not allow smugglers to intrude on his territory and hired ten people from the Opium Den Association to form a spy group to curb "private" opium sales. As they pursued more fiercely, the smugglers' smuggling methods became more cunning. First, they competed in intelligence, then they resorted to violence. After the spy group of the Association armed themselves, one of the smugglers</p>
<p>Also armed themselves. Therefore, there have been constant concerns about armed fights between the two sides in the past, and it is still the case today. Both sides have their own customers who buy opium, so they are very jealous of each other. According to well-informed sources, even the killings of several pseudo-police officers have no political nature. They now increasingly feel that most of these so-called "political assassinations" should be attributed to the opium trade.</p>

<p>The Portuguese steamer Wanli, formerly represented by the Anping Company, with a gross tonnage of 759 tons and a net tonnage of 423 tons, built in 1891, has been moored at the Japanese naval wharf in Hongkou since being detained by the Japanese Navy. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the shipping industry that after the Portuguese consulate negotiated with the Japanese side, the ship has been released and sold to other merchants. It is now represented by the Hengfeng Shipping Company. As soon as the repairs are completed, it will start sailing on the line between Shanghai ports.</p>

<p>Since the Central Corps Headquarters of the Sanmin Zhongyi Youth Corps sent investigator and commander Xue to Shanghai, he has established a headquarters in the suburbs of Shanghai and reported it to Commander Gu of the Third War Area for reference. Now, Xue believes that the significance of the anti-Japanese war and the original tasks they bear in the future have not been thoroughly understood by the people in the guerrilla areas and the self-defense groups of various counties. Therefore, there have been cases of defection and joining the enemy, and it is urgent to provide them with military and political common sense training to enhance the strength of the anti-Japanese war. He has now recruited young intellectuals and tasked the training group of the corps to conduct training as soon as possible in accordance with the promulgated outline, so as to distribute them to various troops and mass groups for universal training, and to help launch a full-scale war of resistance. It is said that most of the staff of the headquarters are graduates of the Central Military Academy who are hard-working and have been welcomed by the people. The headquarters has a member registration group. Regardless of military, police, party, government, and youth, anyone with patriotic enthusiasm, regardless of gender, can request to join the corps with the introduction of two or more members. According to the organizational regulations of the corps, the Central Corps Headquarters is followed by the branch corps, with the province as the unit, and then the district corps, with the city as the unit. The two provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have already had personnel sent by the central government to prepare for the establishment of branch corps respectively, and there is no other organization to disrupt the system. It is also planned to organize a directly affiliated district corps in Shanghai in accordance with the charter. Xue has also submitted a special report based on his investigation results, requesting that personnel be sent to assist in the process.</p>

<p>Some Workers Have Resumed Work: Hope That Wantai Will Stop Monopolizing</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reports that after the gravel industry association opposed Wantai's monopolistic operations and declared a strike, the striking workers have now resumed transporting sand from Sijiao to Shanghai. In order to discuss how to deal with the Wantai incident, the gravel industry association decided to hold a temporary emergency meeting at the association's office at 2 pm today. At that time, the following will be discussed: (1) Wantai Gravel Company's monopolization of sand transportation affects the city's construction and the livelihoods of more than 10,000 sand transportation workers. It is hoped that the company will stop monopolizing and cooperate to avoid harming each other's rights; (2) Although Wang Pinrong, the captain of the guerrilla team stationed in Sijiao, has approved the original sand transportation method, the sand transportation workers of each gang have not fully resumed work. It is planned that relevant members will send personnel to persuade them on the spot within a few days. As for the case of Wantai Gravel Company accusing Fang Jinxiang and others of obstructing business, the Shanghai First Special District Court announced the judgment after three hearings yesterday. Based on three days of business calculation, the total loss reached 511.5 yuan, which was compensated by the defendants Fang Jinxiang and others. It is said that the defendants expressed dissatisfaction and filed an appeal.</p>

<p>Propaganda Against Transporting Steel to Japan: Foreigners Show Sympathy, Achieving Significant Results</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Chinese people all over the world were generously donating money to their motherland. Overseas Chinese in the United States donated a large amount of money. The local overseas Chinese also launched a "movement to stop transporting iron to aid the enemy." According to Mr. Wang, an overseas Chinese businessman who recently returned to Shanghai from San Francisco, the overseas Chinese in San Francisco, in addition to actively raising donations and donating to the national crisis, launched a "movement to stop transporting iron to aid the enemy" at the beginning of last month. The purpose of this movement is to persuade overseas Chinese and Americans not to transport steel and other metals from the United States to Japan, so as not to increase the raw materials for Japanese military equipment and increase their power to invade China. Since its promotion, many knowledgeable overseas Chinese have joined in droves, automatically propagating to their friends or foreigners, and have won the sympathy of enlightened Americans, achieving significant results. Recently, the amount of steel and other metals transported by ships leaving the United States for Japan has been greatly reduced, even to the point of none. At the same time, overseas Chinese in other ports have also responded one after another, voluntarily propagating to all parties not to transport metal materials to Japan. This move by overseas Chinese is of great benefit to the motherland's war of resistance.</p>

<p>Old Woman Also Files Civil Suit Requesting Return of Leather Suitcase</p>
<p>Case Requires Detailed Investigation, Summoning Witnesses for Further Trial</p>
<p>Zhang Bingxin, a deceased wealthy Shanghai jeweler, held a high position in the jewelry industry association of the old schoolyard. He came from a poor family in his early years. When his father died, Bingxin was only eight years old. He relied on his mother, Zhang Ou (now 75 years old, residing at No. 31 Continental Square, Rue de la Tailles), to raise him with hard work. After he started doing business, his family gradually became wealthy. He originally lived in Shipinong, Ximen, which was self-owned real estate. Bingxin married a wife but had no children.</p>
<p>He adopted a son named Haoqiu, who is 23 years old this year and has been married. Bingxin then took two concubines, Qin (45 years old this year) and Dai (30 years old this year), both from Suzhou. Qin also had no children, only Dai gave birth to a daughter named Haoju, who is seven years old this year. Bingxin's wife died three years ago, but the wives and concubines lived separately, each establishing their own household. When the August 13th incident occurred two years ago, Bingxin welcomed his old mother, son, daughter-in-law, and two concubines to</p>
<p>Seek refuge and moved to No. 234 Route D'elias. Unexpectedly, Bingxin fell ill and died in the Red Cross Hospital in November of that year. The valuable jewels, jade, antiques, and real estate he left behind were worth nearly one million yuan. Bingxin's friends Tu Zhengge (the turncoat lawyer who served as the president of the pseudo-Shanghai District Court, Tu Fuxian, has been killed) and Huang Ruisheng (currently residing at No. 74 Rue Massenet), together with relatives, inventoried the items and sealed them in a leather suitcase.</p>
<p>Tu issued a seal and handed it to Zhang's mother, the old lady Ou. In March of the 27th year, Bingxin's two concubines, Qin and Dai, and his son Haoqiu, took out the suitcase while Ou was out and deposited it at Huang Ruisheng's house, never to return. In May, Haoqiu welcomed Ou to live at No. 31 Continental Square. Then Haoqiu and his wife moved out again, leaving Ou alone and neglecting her. Zhang Ou recently entrusted lawyers Ge Zhitan and Sun Deji to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Special Court,</p>
<p>Accusing her son's concubines Qin, Dai, grandson Haoqiu, and Huang Ruisheng of colluding in theft of entrusted stolen goods and abandoning the elderly. She requested that they be investigated and prosecuted according to law and filed a civil suit to recover the stolen leather suitcase, requesting urgent disposition and that the suitcase be seized to prevent loss. After receiving the complaint, the court once held a hearing, but because the defendants did not arrive, the date was changed. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Miao Qingbang</p>
<p>Held a continued hearing. The defendants Zhang Qin, Zhang Dai, and Zhang Haoqiu arrived in court with their defense lawyers. The fourth defendant, Huang Ruisheng, was represented by lawyer Song Yunhui due to illness. First, the plaintiff's attorney stated the intention of the prosecution. Zhang Tu then testified that after her husband's death, Kong Shunlin helped her copy the property into five shares and opened the bank safety deposit box. Since her residence was insecure, she deposited the leather suitcase at Huang's house.</p>
<p>Now I have divided one-tenth of it with Dai and my mother-in-law, and the remaining seven-tenths are evenly divided between Haoqiu and Haoju. Zhang Haoqiu testified that when the family was divided on December 31 of the previous year, he notified his grandmother, but she did not attend. He put her share in the Salt Industry Bank safety deposit box and sealed it by a lawyer. At this point, the plaintiff's attorney presented the newspaper advertisement posted by Zhang Haoqiu, which stated that the inheritance must be analyzed with the consent of the grandmother, and the letters. The court believed that the case needed to be thoroughly investigated and witnesses were necessary. Therefore, the court ordered a change of date for another hearing and adjourned the court.</p>

<p>Escaped While Resisting Arrest at the Old Dongfang Hotel: Four More Robbers Arrested Based on Informants</p>
<p>Yang Chengcai, a Chinese detective of the Laozha Police Station, based on the report of informants, said that there were robber gangs hiding in Room 223 of the Old Dongfang Hotel at No. 245 Zhejiang Road. On the afternoon of the 15th of this month at 4:15, he secretly went with the Western detective Smimus, the Chinese detectives Cao Qishan and Huang Cifu, etc., and arrested the robber Li Jianming (aka Amao). While interrogating, Li took the opportunity to suddenly take out a pistol from his pocket</p>
<p>And shot at the detectives, causing Yang Detective's arm and Cao Huang's hands to be injured by bullets. Li then escaped in this chaos. After the police station sent a large number of detectives to arrive, the murderer had already fled far away. Afterwards, the police station, seeing that Li dared to resist arrest and escape, was bold and reckless, ordered all police stations to</p>
<p>Strictly pursue and arrest him. On the evening of the 23rd of this month at 10:30, the Chinese and Western detectives of the Xinzha Police Station learned that Li Jianming was hiding in the house at No. 219 Yunfu Road, and immediately went to arrest Li again and brought him to the police station. Two bank deposit books, two checkbooks, one pawn ticket, and 732 yuan of legal currency were found on his body. He was ordered to be detained and sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court on the morning of the 24th. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the case,</p>
<p>Applied for detention, and the court ordered approval. However, the detectives handling the case continued to investigate without sparing any effort. On the afternoon of the 24th, the accomplices Chen Baosheng and Li Dazhang from Jiangbei, who were exchanging gold jewelry, were arrested at the Qiu Tianbao Jewelry Store at No. 592 Nanjing Road. Then, based on the confession, Huang Xingyang and Sang Rongxiang from Shaoxing were arrested at No. 492 Avenue Edward VII and No. 11 Lane 876 Penglu, respectively.

<p>Chen and the other four were sent to the First Special Court yesterday morning.

After Fu Lin's judge verified the confession and briefly interrogated each defendant, he ordered them to be detained and tried together with Li's case. However, it is reported that each defendant who was arrested is related to the giant robbery case of more than 40,000 yuan from Yitaihing.</p>

<p>Requesting contract fulfillment and compensation of 50,000 yuan, with compulsory enforcement of the contract, scheduled for pronouncement</p>
<p>Zheng Zuoyi, 22 years old this year, the son of Zheng Mengyuan, a Chaozhou native and owner of the Kou Cheng pawnshop in the Taihe Lane of the Marshall Road, became acquainted with Zhang Xiuying, a Wuxi woman (20 years old this year), residing at No. 42, Lane 4, Route Lorton, in 1935. They cohabited at No. 76, Jing'an Villa, and their love deepened. They agreed to marry, and on August 18, 1938, both parties went to Lawyer Chen Yong's office to sign a contract, scheduling the official wedding for September 22 of the same year. If the man</p>
<p>reneged on the agreement, he would have to compensate the woman with 50,000 yuan for living expenses. However, when the date arrived, Zheng Zuoyi actually went against the agreement and became engaged to a woman with a different surname. Zhang Xiuying sent a letter of reproach, but a satisfactory resolution could not be reached. Recently, Zhang Xiuying hired Lawyer Ma Zhenzong as her agent and filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court's Civil Division against Zheng Zuoyi for breach of contract. Judge Wu Xiaoke of the court held a hearing on the 11th of this month. Both parties were represented by lawyers. The defendant commissioned Lawyer Sun Zuji to respond to the defense and filed a counterclaim, requesting</p>
<p>the cancellation of the contract. Court discussions were adjourned to a later date for further examination of witnesses. Details of these events have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, another hearing was held. Both parties were again represented by their lawyers. Lawyer Chen Yong, as a witness, testified that on August 18, 1938, the defendant Zheng Zuoyi, accompanied by Cao Wufeng, came to his office and asked him to witness and draw up a contract, scheduling the wedding with the plaintiff Zhang Xiuying for September 22. In case of reneging on the agreement,</p>
<p>compensation of 50,000 yuan would be paid for losses. After he drafted the contract, they went to the woman's home to formally sign it. He asked the defendant why it was necessary to go through this procedure and why such a large sum was to be paid as compensation. The defendant replied that he loved her dearly and feared that the woman might change her mind, so a contract was necessary, and money was no problem. Cao Wufeng testified that he had known the defendant for nearly two years. Before the contract was signed, Zheng came to his house twice and said that he wanted to marry the plaintiff and that a contract had to be signed. On August 18, Zheng sent a car to pick him up and they went to the lawyer's office together. After drafting the document, they went to the woman's home to formally sign it. When asked whether the woman showed any</p>
<p>coercive behavior during the signing, he answered no. After hearing the testimonies, the court considered the case clear and ordered closing arguments. The plaintiff's lawyer argued that the defendant loved the plaintiff and signed the marriage contract without coercion. As for the defendant's claim that he suffered from meningitis, which caused mental confusion, the defendant had studied at Fudan and Chi Chih Universities and is now working at Ning Shao Insurance Company, indicating that he has considerable experience and education. There is no reason to believe he would handle matters carelessly. The court should order him to pay compensation according to the contract and enforce it compulsorily, and bear the litigation costs, and reject the counterclaim. Following the defendant's lawyer's response, the court announced the end of the proceedings and scheduled the pronouncement for March 2.</p>

<p>The perpetrator sentenced to five years</p>
<p>Several hairdressers in a barber shop at No. 665 Hankou Road suddenly started singing loudly at midnight on the 4th of the month, when all was quiet. They sang in various dialects, laughing and making noise. The neighbor behind them was the Cuihua Printing Shop at No. 28 Cide Lane, Zhejiang Road. The workers at the printing shop, having worked hard all day, needed to rest at this time. They found it difficult to fall asleep due to the noise. So they went to question the hairdressers, saying that they should not be making such a ruckus and disturbing people's peaceful sleep late at night. Unexpectedly, the hairdressers became angry and a conflict broke out. Initially, there was a verbal argument, which then escalated into a physical fight. During the fight, a hairdresser named Lin Fusheng, also known as Lin Shiji, was injured with an iron bar. After being taken to the hospital, he unexpectedly died from his injuries on the evening of the 6th. The Zhabei police station learned of the incident. Detective Wang Shusen went to the scene and arrested ten people who participated in the fight, including hairdressers and printing workers Mei Chunhua and Mao Xiaocai. They were sent to the First Special Court. Zashi Ru Baoyi of the police station filed charges according to the law. The interrogation has been completed. Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide of the Criminal Division announced the verdict. Mao Xiaocai was sentenced to five years in prison for causing serious injury resulting in death.

<p>Xu Wengui, a 28-year-old Suzhou native and guest at the fourth-floor dormitory of the Sichuan Road YMCA, residing in Room 53, has been living there for nearly half a year, paying nine yuan per month in rent. Recently, the association increased the rent by ten percent, which dissatisfied the guests. Xu's words were perhaps somewhat extreme. The staff of the association took his suitcase, bedding, and other belongings without permission and stored them in the second-floor office before 11 PM the previous evening, before Xu returned to the dormitory. Around midnight, Xu returned from outside and learned of the incident from other guests. Another verbal dispute ensued, and Xu was punched in the chest and arms. The police station sent Chinese and Western detectives to the scene to mediate, and the matter was temporarily resolved. Unexpectedly, Xu returned to the association around 7:30 PM last night. As soon as he reached the second floor, he was blocked from going upstairs by four refugees and several tea attendants who were lying in wait. Words failed, and he was beaten by several people, tearing his suit, tie, and other items. A Westerner witnessed the situation when the attack occurred and, motivated by righteous indignation, immediately signed his name and gave it to Xu Wengui, willing to be a witness. Someone called the police, and everyone was taken to the Central Police Station for investigation.</p>

<p>The truth comes to light after an autopsy</p>
<p>Chu Jiagui, a 31-year-old native of Rugao, made a living pulling a rickshaw in Shanghai. He and his wife, Bai (25 years old), rented a room at No. 24 Zhicheng Lane, Keller Road, in the French Concession. Chu suddenly felt abdominal pain and discomfort on the 18th of this month, which was Lunar New Year's Eve. He consulted a doctor and took medicine, but the treatment was ineffective. He died at 4 PM on the 19th. His wife and his brother, Jiafa (36 years old, residing at No. 17 Tongchang Lane, Haining Road), prepared a coffin and funeral arrangements. The coffin was sent to a boat on Suzhou Creek at Pinlang Road in West Shanghai, waiting to be transported back to their hometown for burial. Unexpectedly, on the 24th, Chu Jiafa suddenly reported to the French police that his sister-in-law, Bai, was not at peace and that Chu Jiagui's death was unclear, with a suspicion of murder. The police chief, after receiving the report, sent detectives to investigate. They brought Chu Bai, the wife, in for questioning. At the same time, detectives, together with the Public Concession police, hoisted the coffin to the autopsy site at Tongren Hospital. Yesterday, they reported to Judge Wang Ren of the Second Special Court, who arrived at the site with a forensic doctor to open the coffin for examination. The body was already severely decomposed. The exterior showed no signs of injury or illness. An autopsy was performed, and the results proved that the deceased, Chu Jiagui, had indeed died of enteritis and there was no other cause. The official instructed that the body be returned to the brother and wife for re-coffining. However, before the examination, the brother and wife accused each other. The brother accused the wife of misconduct and adultery, murdering her husband. The wife accused the brother of attempting to harass her after her husband's death and falsely accusing her of murdering her husband out of spite. After the examination, the truth became clear, and the brother was speechless and silently withdrew.</p>

<p>Fights frequently erupt due to gambling disputes</p>
<p>Since the fall of the western Shanghai towns of Longhua, Caohejing, and other villages, opium and gambling have been openly rampant everywhere. Since the Lunar New Year's Day, the teahouses and gambling dens have become even more prosperous. Gambling addicts neglect sleep and meals, indulging in it. Currently, in the towns of Zhujiahang, Changqiao, and Meilong, under the management of the Japanese army, people shout and gamble day and night. As a result, verbal disputes and fights occur from time to time. Yesterday morning, in the teahouse opened by Mao Xiaodi, a native of Chongming in Longhua Town, two gamblers argued over gambling money and physically fought. Although bystanders mediated at the time, they temporarily dispersed. Unexpectedly, in the evening, the two sides clashed again. A disagreement led to a big fight. Several gamblers, including Qian Jinmao (a local resident who sells fresh produce), were seriously injured. The teahouse's benches and teapots were smashed to pieces, causing considerable damage.</p>

<p>Fiancé requests rejection, pronouncement scheduled for March 2</p>
<p>Wang Caiying, also known as Wang Miaojin, a 29-year-old Anhui native who used to perform Tan Huang at the Tianyun Lou of Wing On Company, currently residing at No. 13 Yixing Lane, Qipu Road, recently hired Lawyer Mu Qi as her agent and filed a lawsuit with the Second Special Court's Civil Division against her fiancé Wu Xianglin (31-year-old Ningbo native, residing above the Kangfa Western-style Clothing Store at Nos. 81-83 Avenue Joffre), to</p>
<p>dissolve the engagement. The reasons for the lawsuit are roughly as follows: The defendant met the plaintiff in the summer of 1936. He claimed to be an inspector at the Jianghai Customs, boasting of abundant profits and a wealthy family. He had recently lost his wife and was looking for a woman to remarry. He regarded the plaintiff as a celestial being, pursuing her relentlessly and seeking marriage. The plaintiff, being a woman with limited knowledge, was confused and agreed to the engagement. Before two months had passed, the defendant changed his demeanor, claiming that the customs job was too arduous and he wanted to switch to the shipping business.</p>
<p>He demanded that the plaintiff provide a guarantee of 500 yuan. When she refused, he scolded her for being heartless and insulted her at will. Subsequently, taking advantage of the plaintiff's lack of preparedness, he secretly took the plaintiff's diamond ring. After the plaintiff and her brothers negotiated with him, his brother took responsibility for returning it. Later, while the plaintiff was going to Hangzhou to burn incense, he falsely claimed to entrust her with the repair of a wireless radio. He tricked the maid into giving him a six-tube radio worth 200 yuan. The defendant is so idle and unwilling to work that it is difficult to marry and live with him. She has no choice but to sue, requesting</p>
<p>permission to terminate the contract, etc. Upon receiving the lawsuit, the court, on the 28th of last month, had Judge Wu Xiaoke try the case in Civil Division 7. The plaintiff mistakenly went to the Fourth Tribunal to wait for trial, resulting in the defendant being the only one present for questioning when this case was being tried in the Seventh Tribunal. The court concluded the single-party argument as the plaintiff was not present and scheduled the pronouncement. When the plaintiff learned that she had mistakenly gone to the Fourth Tribunal, she rushed to the Seventh Tribunal, but the court had already adjourned. Therefore, the plaintiff petitioned the court, stating the error and requesting that the debate be reopened. Details of these events have been reported in this newspaper. This case has been approved by the court,</p>
<p>and the debate was reopened yesterday morning. Judge Wu still tried the case in Civil Division 7. Both parties arrived with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff's lawyer and the plaintiff stated the reasons for the lawsuit, saying that the defendant's various actions were inappropriate and that they could not get along together, requesting permission to dissolve the contract. The defendant's side argued that Lawyer Lu Qi had witnessed the engagement and that he had repeatedly requested to marry, but the plaintiff had refused. When they became engaged, the plaintiff had investigated and found that the defendant had considerable wealth. There is no substantial reason to request cancellation.</p>
<p>He requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The plaintiff's side also presented documents as evidence, saying that after obtaining a love letter from another woman in the defendant's pocket earlier, the defendant had sworn not to associate with other women, but the defendant claimed that this happened before the engagement and the written document could not be used as evidence, etc. The court reviewed the situation, announced the conclusion, and scheduled the pronouncement for March 2.</p>

<h3 id="e102">After the War, Chinese Shipyards Were All Occupied by the Japanese <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>All Eleven Shipyards were Occupied and Reopened with Hired Workers</p>
<p>Shanghai's shipbuilding industry was quite developed before the war. According to investigations, there were ten large and small Chinese state-run shipyards along the banks of the Huangpu River: the Jiangnan Shipyard in Nanshi, and the privately-run Laogongmao in Bailianjing, Sanbei in Rihuigang, Dachunghua in Dinghaiqiao, Hongchang and Hexing in Nanshi, and Caili, Longchang, Hengchangxiang, Hongxiangxing, and Merchants' Inland River in Lujiazui. There were three British-owned shipyards: Ruirong in Yangshupu, Hefeng in Gaomiao, and Xiangsheng in Lujiazui (now merged into United British). There was one French-owned shipyard: Qiuxin in Nanshi. Japanese merchants had no foothold in this industry, so Japanese merchant ships had to be entrusted to Chinese and foreign shipyards for repairs. After the war, with the exception of the foreign shipyards, all eleven Chinese state-owned and privately-run shipyards were occupied by the Japanese army. The Japanese Mitsubishi Corporation obtained government assistance and seized the Jiangnan Shipyard, renaming it Mitsubishi Shipyard and hiring workers to reopen it, hoping to expand its influence in the shipbuilding industry. Unexpectedly, the Japanese Nissin Company, also with the approval of the Japanese authorities, forcibly moved all the machinery and assets of five Chinese shipyards in Lujiazui, Pudong – Caili, Longchang, Hengchangxiang, Hongxiangxing, and Merchants' Inland River – to the vacant land of Taitong Warehouse in the eastern district, and established the so-called Nissin Shipyard. It has already employed five or six hundred ignorant workers, led by foreman Zhang Linhua, to specialize in repairing Japanese merchant ships, while other foreign merchant ships are ignored. In addition, the Laogongmao Shipyard in Pudong was occupied by the Japanese Navy, and the Dachunghua Shipyard in Dinghaiqiao was occupied by the Japanese Army. All Chinese-owned shipyards have been plundered by the Japanese. Therefore, the Japanese ambition to control Shanghai's shipbuilding industry is becoming increasingly active.</p>

<p>The puppet "Vice Minister" Lian Yu concurrently serves as "Foreign Minister." Xiandai News reports that after the puppet "Local Court President" Tu Fu, the puppet "Foreign Minister" Chen Lu of the Reformed Government, and the puppet "Minister of Transportation" Li Guojie, and others were assassinated in Shanghai one after another, all the villains were terrified and discussed "methods of comforting the dead," a truly pitiable situation. It is now known that the puppet organization, in addition to discussing "compensation" methods, will give the deceased puppet officials a relatively "solemn" memorial service and has scheduled a memorial service for Tu Fu on March 1 at the puppet Local Court on Penglai Road in Nanshi. A live drama will be performed to express the meaning of "a hare dies, a fox laments." It is also known that after the puppet "Foreign Minister" Chen Lu was killed, it has now been decided that the puppet "Vice Minister" Lian Yu will concurrently serve.</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in handling the reconciliation case filed by the Shanghai Minhang Pudong Commercial Bank, has scheduled a deadline for debt registration and the convening of a creditors' meeting, and has issued a special announcement stating that: According to a letter from the Shanghai Minhang Pudong Commercial Bank, "Our bank is now unable to balance receipts and payments due to the impact of the war. We hereby apply for reconciliation in accordance with Article 41 of the Bankruptcy Law, and have attached the reconciliation plan and register, etc., to the meeting." The application was deemed legally compliant and the bank was informed that it would be accepted for processing, and the Executive Committee of this Chamber, Pei Yunqing, and accountant Wang Haifan, were appointed to handle it together. It is now scheduled that the period from now until April 7th (Gregorian calendar) will be the period for registering debts. All creditors of the bank are requested to bring their debt certificates within the aforementioned period and go to Wang Haifan's accounting firm at No. 2 Avenue Edouard VII (at the intersection of Rue Kin-Lienweg), French Concession, to register in accordance with the law.

<p>In order to control the Pudong River's short-distance transportation, the Japanese Shanghai Ferry Company has recently opened a new cross-river line from the Bund of Beijing Road to the Qichang Stack in Pudong, dispatching a ferry to transport passengers. However, because the Qichang Stack wharf in Pudong has not yet been opened, and those without Japanese passes cannot enter or exit, the number of passengers is very small. The company has approached the Japanese army in Pudong, allowing civilians to exchange their counterfeit "citizen's certificates" with a photo attached for Qichang Stack entry and exit permits. However, the public ignores this initiative to forcibly attract customers to prevent danger, so no one goes to get a permit.</p>

<p>Armed Robbery and Carrying Away Loot, Demonstrating the General State of Local Security</p>
<p>Xue Taisheng, a Ningbo native residing at No. 75 behind Tianwangtang, Dongjiadu, Nanshi, used to set up a preserved goods stall in the local vegetable market, selling salted fish. His business was not bad on weekdays, and he had some savings, which attracted the attention of local bandits. Around 11:00 PM on the previous (24th) night, more than a dozen bandits suddenly broke into his house, armed with torches, single-edged swords, and iron bars, and rushed to the upper floor. At that time, Xue and his wife were already asleep. The bandits dragged them out of bed, forced them to hand over cash, and when they refused, they brutally beat Xue with iron bars, covering him with injuries. Xue, unable to bear the pain, called his wife for help. The bandits then tied Xue's wife with ropes and burned her breasts with candle flames. Xue's wife, in excruciating pain, finally agreed to hand over 42 yuan in cash, 3.7 yuan in fractional currency, and more than 2 yuan in copper coins to the bandits. But the bandits were still unsatisfied. They took more than ten cotton robes, cotton pants, single-layer clothes, four cotton quilts, a basket of salted hairtail, and more than five dou of white rice, packed them all in sacks, robbed them separately, and fled.</p>

<h3 id="e114">Finance Frenzied Pursuit…It's All About Gold's Inherent Value! All Quarters Vigorously Pursue Cash Markets Peak Price Reached 2,145 Yuan Reportedly, Hong Kong Market Also at 2,190 Yuan Is It True That Everything Besides Gold Is Worthless? <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash gold market was volatile and the situation was chaotic. The extreme scarcity of gold led to a surge in gold prices, soaring to unprecedented heights due to a severe shortage of available gold. Trading was exceptionally active, reaching 1,180 taels citywide. Initially, securities firms, led by firms from northern China, aggressively pushed prices up, opening at 2,110 yuan. Hearing that Hong Kong gold prices were around 2,190 yuan, Hong Kong firms continued to commission cash brokers and certain money exchange houses to accumulate gold, believing that the profit margin from transporting gold to Hong Kong remained substantial. Reportedly, certain Chinese banks and foreign banks were also buying in, while certain parties were secretly active in relentless accumulation. This further fueled public anxiety, leaving sellers helpless, and intensifying the price surge. The price then soared past the major milestones of 2,120 and 2,140 yuan. In the afternoon opening, the price hit a record high of 2,145 yuan. However, as Shanghai and Hong Kong gold prices converged, leaving little profit margin after accounting for transportation costs, approximately 200 taels were released by brokers on commission, and wealthy local merchants also reduced their positions. Buyers, seeing the high prices, stopped accumulating, causing the market to weaken and prices to fall back down by 10 yuan. Nevertheless, the closing price still rose sharply by 26.5 yuan. The day's trading was extremely frenzied, with jewelry gold changing hands as many as five times, setting a new record for price volatility since jewelry gold trading began. English pure gold and customs gold declined slightly. (Editor's note: Gold market fluctuations usually follow foreign exchange rates. However, the recent surge in gold prices, while the foreign exchange market has been stable, is an unusual occurrence.)</p>
<p>Gold Soars by Twenty-Six and a Half Yuan Since the morning opening, the initial bid price from buyers was 2,108 yuan per strip (ten taels). However, sellers demanded 2,115 yuan before agreeing to sell. The stalemate continued until 10:15 AM, when a northern firm entered the market with 50 taels at the opening price of 2,115 yuan, which was 6.5 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price. After the opening, sellers were scarce, leading to further market chaos and continued upward price movement. A money exchange house bought 50 taels for 2,118 yuan, and a cash brokerage bought another 50 taels for 2,118 yuan, both sold by a certain money exchange house on behalf of local firms. Later, a jewelry store, acting on behalf of Hong Kong firms, bought 50 taels from its peers for 2,120 yuan. Subsequently, the same cash brokerage bought another 50 taels from jewelry stores at the same price. At that time, a northern firm bought another 50 taels at 2,122 yuan, and a jewelry store bought 50 taels at 2,121 yuan, all supplied by a certain gold firm. After accumulating, the northern firm abruptly sold 50 taels back to jewelry firms at 2,121 yuan. A cash brokerage then bought 50 taels from jewelry firms at the same price. Following that, another cash brokerage bought 50 taels from money exchange houses at 2,122 yuan. Afterwards, sellers became even scarcer, and a certain money exchange house aggressively accumulated gold on behalf of foreign banks, further fueling the price surge. A cash brokerage bought 50 taels from jewelry firms at 2,144 yuan for the noon closing price. In the afternoon opening, the buying interest from jewelry firms remained strong, causing further price increases. Jewelry firms bought 50 taels from money exchange houses at 2,145 yuan, the highest price of the day. Subsequently, gold firms continued to sell, leading to a downward correction. A gold firm sold 50 taels to jewelry firms for 2,141 yuan. Subsequently, cash brokerages and others stepped in, pushing the price down from 2,141 yuan to 2,135 yuan. Finally, a jewelry firm sold 30 taels to a money exchange house at 2,135 yuan for the evening closing price, which was 26.5 yuan higher than the previous day's closing price (marking five consecutive days of gains, totaling 79 yuan). Throughout the day, there was a price range of 30 yuan. The selling price of branded gold from cash brokerages reached 2,145 yuan, with a buying price of 2,130 yuan. The current margin is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with no trading activity.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Jumps Four Times in a Row The selling price of jewelry gold from jewelry stores was initially unchanged. However, at 10:25 AM, it was raised by one yuan per tael. After half an hour, it was raised again by one yuan. Then, at 11:40 AM, it was raised again by one yuan. New businesses listed the price at 215 yuan, all reaching unprecedented peaks. Later, at 4:05 PM, due to a slight pullback in raw gold prices, the price was also lowered by one yuan. The old Qingyun firm revised its price to 216 yuan, while the new businesses revised their prices to 214 yuan, with a buying price of 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Pound Sterling Strengthens, Pure Gold Falls On the 24th, a London cable stated that English pure gold fell due to the strengthening of the pound sterling, decreasing by half a pence per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 3 and a half pence. This caused the China cash buying and selling price of the Central Bank to also decrease to 1,210 yuan and 0.6 jiao. The listed customs gold price fell by 2 li, amounting to 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 2 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also decreased by 3 jiao, amounting to 1,205 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Foreign Exchange Stable as Always! HSBC Maintains Position on Tianjin and Peking Front Money Exchange Houses Dump Forward US Dollar <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw favorable conditions, with increased buying activity by foreign banks on behalf of Tianjin and Peking, as well as various major trading houses and Chinese speculators. However, foreign banks such as HSBC continued to offer ample supply, and money exchange houses also dumped forward US dollars, resulting in little change throughout the process. Trading was relatively active in the first half of the day. The Hong Kong market remained stable due to balanced supply and demand. However, according to a certain person in the industry, the buying frenzy may tighten the market slightly next week.</p>
<p>Initially, the recent short-term London Cable contract continued to shrink by 0.0625, while the long-term contract remained flat. New York silver prices also remained stagnant. The London spot gold price shrank by half a pence. The exchange rate for British pounds against US dollars increased by 1 centime and 3 mils, while the rates against French francs and Shanghai dollars remained unchanged. The US dollar rate against British pounds increased by 0.1875, while the rates against French francs and Shanghai dollars remained unchanged. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained stagnant as before. The banks' opening selling prices were 8 pence and 0.125 for British pounds and 15 yuan and 875 for US dollars, with no change from the previous closing prices. After the opening, the market was quite sluggish. When HSBC's listed prices were released, they remained unchanged. The white silver equalization tax was also announced to be reduced by 0.25, with a tax rate of 7.75%. At that time, foreign firms again, on behalf of Tianjin and Peking foreign merchant banks, as well as trading houses and Chinese speculators, scrambled to buy British and US dollars. However, foreign banks such as HSBC continued to supply the market steadily, so the situation remained unchanged. Trading houses and Chinese firms bought British pounds from HSBC for 8 pence and 0.125. Subsequently, trading houses bought US dollars from a certain bank for 15 yuan and 875. Near noon, a money exchange house suddenly sold (March) US dollars to a foreign bank for 15 yuan and 75. After this, trading houses again bought Hong Kong dollars from a foreign Chinese-Italian exchange house for 54 yuan and 375, so the process remained quite stable. The banks' noon closing selling prices were 8 pence and 0.125 for British pounds and 15 yuan and 875 for US dollars, the same as the morning opening prices. As a result, there was still no change in the British and US dollar rates from the previous closing prices, and the Hong Kong dollar rate also remained unchanged. In the afternoon, there was no market on Saturday.</p>

<p>A London cable on the 24th stated that speculators were selling while India was buying, resulting in a flat market. After the closing, the market remained flat. A small number of Indian firms bought at the listed prices. The short-term cable contract shrunk by 0.0625, while the long-term contract remained flat. A New York silver cable stated that US silver prices remained stagnant. A Bombay silver cable stated that the Indian silver market had turned flat, with the spot price shrinking by one anna, while the near and far-term prices remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Driven by Gold Craze, British Gold Pound Soars by Nine Jiao <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, English pure gold fell by half a pence, and the exchange rate for British pounds against US dollars increased by 0.1875. Foreign exchange trading houses still had strong demand, and banks provided a steady supply, due to occasional sales from Hong Kong. The market price was stable throughout the day, with little change. Raw gold opened high, with Hong Kong firms actively accumulating it, followed by gold firms and jewelry stores. The availability of gold was originally very scarce, and once it was sought, the market price skyrocketed. Wealthy firms in Tianjin and Hong Kong relentlessly pursued it, with the soaring price seemingly endless. Although there was a slight decline at the closing, it ultimately did not stem the tide, leaving it uncertain where it would end. Foreign currencies were affected by the gold market, with the British gold pound surging by approximately one yuan. Wealthy individuals were insatiably greedy, with few sales and strong buying interest, making supply difficult and trading scarce. Trading in US dollar bills was very active, with the price increasing by one point only. The majority of other currencies remained unchanged due to stable exchange rates. There was no trading in the Association market. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: British gold pound rose by nine jiao, English gold rose by eight fen, US gold pound rose by seven jiao, US dollar bill rose by one fen, Hong Kong bill rose by half a li, French franc bill rose by 2.5 hao, Singapore bill rose by two fen, Australian gold bill rose by one jiao, and all other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Securities Market Sees Many Optimistic Factors Is It Real, Or Is It Not? <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The securities market yesterday was still rather firm, there were many rumors of peace in the market, and the issue of resuming operations at the exchange was also being prepared. In addition, new international loans have been established, and the morale of the market is gradually increasing. Since the change in interest law on January 16, the market has plummeted and has only recently gradually woken up and slowly returned higher. In the past, the process has mostly been affected by the outflow of spot goods from Xie Da. Sales have gradually shrunk to this day, and most of the goods issued by this firm have been absorbed by the financial industry at low prices, so the market does not take it seriously, and retail investors have also been absorbing it quite a bit. Therefore, the future market price may still be able to return to its previous state. Yesterday, it was still only half a day of trading. The first buyers were Runli and Tongkang, and the market price tightened. Although there were a few sales from No. 46 and Xie Da, retail demand was still strong, and No. 38 was trading in type B for type C and E, which was quite a large amount. The market is still seeing demand exceeding supply, and the market trend is still rising. There was still no trading in type D, and the market price resulted in a continuation of good conditions, with increases of 2.5 jiao to 4.5 jiao. The total number of transactions was approximately 400,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Cotton Yarn The Main Reasons for the Sharp Drop in Yarn Prices Difficult Southern Transportation, Spring Sales Not Yet Started Tianjin Chinese Yarn Arrives in Shanghai for Sale Warehouses Stockpile More Than 100,000 Bales Small Spinning Mills Reopen <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The long-standing high yarn market has recently shown a downward trend due to the fact that actual demand has not picked up after the opening of the new year. In fact, at the end of last year, wealthy people were enthusiastically collecting, expecting that there would be a new atmosphere in the new year, that customer sales would be smooth, and that prices would rise. Therefore, the closing price last year had risen to 403.5 yuan. However, the opening price of the new year was not as high as expected, and the period of high prices was very short. The high price had reached 406 yuan, but customer demand was sluggish and undeveloped. Since the Japanese invasion of Hainan Island, the war has continued. As for eastern Zhejiang, although our military positions are solid and the people are peaceful, Japanese warships are constantly harassing the area. All of the above conditions have prevented the market from moving forward and have put heavy pressure on it. Therefore, prices have fallen instead of rising. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn has fallen by about 10 yuan compared to the end of the year. According to reliable sources, the products of Tianjin Chinese yarn have been squeezed out of the market by other yarns and have no foothold there. They are now being transported south to find a way out. Soon, 4,000 to 5,000 bales will arrive in Shanghai, and the next batch will have several thousand bales. According to research, the amount of cotton yarn and cotton cloth stored in the warehouses in this city is full, with an estimated inventory of more than 100,000 bales, of which Chinese yarn accounts for more than 60% and Japanese yarn accounts for slightly less than 40%. In terms of the current situation, it cannot be said that the 100,000 bales of yarn in stock is not a lot. However, yarn sales are still in the peak season of spring sales. If prices fall, there may be a large amount of development. Therefore, Mr. Wu and the financial community are absorbing and maintaining prices in the market every day. There is also a saying that the newly created small spinning mills, with nearly 100,000 spindles, have already been able to fully operate, and the amount of production has certainly increased. However, the raw cotton cannot be relaxed, and the factory's costs are higher than in the past. (A)</p>
<p>Transactions Between Industry Peers Account for 80%</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the decline became more and more severe. Due to the poor environment, sluggish actual demand, and the lack of appetite from customers, most speculators, seeing the poor momentum, sold off according to the market. The trading floor was very loose, but certain industry peers absorbed a large amount of long positions, and continued to buy at low prices. Their intention was that it was still early in the spring sales season, and according to folk customs, the villagers were still entertaining themselves, and customer sales would only develop after the Lantern Festival. The market still had hope of rising, so the amount of money they ate in continued to increase, and their desire to see prices rise was very deep. According to a survey of the market transactions throughout the day, the transactions between industry peers and hoarders accounted for more than 80%.</p>
<p>Double Horse Yarn Falls 4.5 Yuan</p>
<p>As for the situation of existing yarn, the market was tired at the opening in the morning. Because actual transactions were not active, the market was overwhelmed with sellers, and the opening price fell by 1 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 399 yuan, and 30 bales were transacted between industry peers. A cotton company also came to vomit. The market price gradually decreased. The final price of Double Horse was 395.5 yuan, but the trend was still weak. Fortunately, a certain person came to buy 100-200 bales of Double Horse yarn from a foreign warehouse, and the market was able to stabilize. According to statistics, various groups bought a total of 1,645 bales throughout the day. Industry peers transacted 1,310 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse fell 5.5 yuan, Double Ball fell 4 yuan, Te Jincheng fell 3 yuan, Heavenly Maiden fell 5 yuan, and coarse yarn fell 1-2 yuan. The Xinhe Yarn Factory opened with 150 bales of 20-count Five Sons at a price of 395 yuan. Yesterday, 640 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Shantou, and 35 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount bought by each group is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Industry Peers 1,310 Xiamen 25</p>
<p>Yunnan 185 Shantou 80</p>
<p>Wenzhou 35 Ningbo 10</p>
<p>Total 1,645</p>
<p>Crystal Yarn Also Falls by 2 Yuan</p>
<p>Trading in Japanese yarn remained as sluggish as ever. The needs of all parties were sparse, and market prices also tended to go downstream. The price of 20-count Mizuki yarn was 335-333 yuan, and the price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 330-328 yuan, both falling by 2 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Although Yarn Prices Fall, Raw Cotton Is Not Affected Due to Difficulty in Shipping From Production Areas <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The raw cotton business has not seen much development, but Chinese and foreign factories have gradually become more active. Therefore, although yarn prices have fallen, raw cotton prices have been able to maintain their stability. In fact, the stock is weak. In addition, in this chaotic environment, the best cotton from the various production areas has already been loaded and exported by others. What remains are inferior goods, and the roads are difficult and the taxes are heavy, making it difficult to ship them out. The few that can reach Shanghai are like fish that have slipped through the net. According to this situation, how can market prices fall? There is still no supply from Tonghua. However, a British ship arrived in Shanghai from Europe the day before yesterday, with 2,600 pieces of cotton from Bombay, all purchased by Japanese merchants. The current cotton transaction volume and market prices are listed on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Shenxin Purchases High-Grade Indian Cotton <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, the New York cotton market was exceptionally quiet, with no new developments. Smith's proposal may be passed in two weeks, and all industry peers are very supportive of his proposal. Recently, due to sluggish sales of cloth, factories have ample inventory, so there have only been sporadic transactions in spot goods. Yesterday, New York rose by 3-4 pounds, India fell by half a rupee including the forecast, and Egypt rose by more than 10 pounds. Yesterday's exchange rate was flat, and converting to legal currency, the price of American cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 1 jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell by 2 jiao, and Egyptian cotton rose by 4 jiao.</p>
<p>Trading in foreign cotton in Shanghai remained sluggish. Factories were all taking a wait-and-see attitude towards purchasing raw cotton due to the weak yarn prices. If there were any particularly cheap prices, they would buy a little. Yesterday, Shenxin bought 500 bales of high-grade Indian cotton, which was white, moist, and clean, with long and soft fibers. The factory price was only 73 yuan, and the quality was much higher than that of Changyinsha, making it very cheap. On the Japanese side, Gongda bought 500 bales of Indian cotton, Toyota bought 500 bales of Indian cotton, and Shanghai and Yufeng each bought 500 bales of Indian cotton. The cotton prices from yesterday are listed below.</p>

<p>School Overview</p>
<p>Nanyang Tutorial School</p>
<p>Nanyang Tutorial School, located at No. 302 Baker Road, is jointly run by Wu Hesi, renowned in both education and science, and Qian Fuqu, the principal of the First Elementary School of Nanyang Middle School. Although it was established this semester, the directors and teachers of each department are mostly experts and university professors. The school's purpose is not only to provide supplementary lessons and cultivate vocational talents in spare time but also to pay special attention to improving the skills and knowledge of elementary and secondary school teachers and training experts. It is divided into three departments: Supplementary, Specialized, and Vocational, with courses including Chinese, English, Japanese, Russian, Mandarin Conversation, English Conversation, Japanese Conversation, Russian Conversation, Mathematics (from Arithmetic to Calculus), Natural Sciences (Biology, Physics, and Chemistry), History and Geography, Commercial Courses (Commercial Bookkeeping, Bank Accounting, Government Accounting, Corporate Accounting, Cost Accounting, Commercial Abacus), Document Application (specializing in applied writing such as official documents, correspondence, contracts, etc.), Calligraphy, Painting and Sculpture (Calligraphy, Chinese Painting, Sculpture, etc.), Stenography (Chinese, English), Chemical Handicraft, Specimen Making, Wireless Engineering, Traditional Chinese Medicine, Western Medicine, and Harmonica. The directors of each department include Zhu Jianmang for Chinese (the author of the Chinese textbooks for all levels of the World Book Company), Principal Wu personally teaches Document Application, Fang Guangtao for English and English Conversation (Professor of Linguistics at Jinan University), Xu Zhuodai for Japanese (also known as Li Amao), Russian Slaloff for Russian and Russian Conversation (Professor of Literature at Moscow University), Bi Jingqian for Mathematics (former Professor of Mathematics at Fudan University), Xue Deyu for Biology (Biology expert and instructor at the Central Political School), Gui Chengtai for Higher Commercial Courses (accountant), Cai Rui for Calligraphy, Painting, and Sculpture (former president of the Shenzhou Chinese Medicine University and director of the Central Chinese Medicine Museum), and Zhang Zanchen (famous surgeon, director of the Central Chinese Medicine Museum, and editor of the Medical Spring and Autumn Society), etc. Other departments also have specialized experts. Since the outbreak of the July 7th Incident, the number of faculty and students from universities and middle schools who have sacrificed on the front lines and in other areas is alarming. It is currently urgent to replenish talents to meet the needs of the country and society. If the elementary school education, which is the foundation of education, and the secondary school, which is the backbone, are too slow and time-consuming, it is currently appropriate to focus on university and supplementary education, especially the latter, which has rapid results. Therefore, Mr. Wu is running this Nanyang Tutorial School to test whether the results can meet his ideals. If the students develop well, it will be expanded into a university. For example, the Department of Traditional Chinese Medicine will be changed to a Medical College, the Department of Calligraphy, Painting, and Sculpture will be expanded into an Academy of Art, and the Language Departments will be combined into a College of Liberal Arts. A University Preparatory Committee has been organized. Furthermore, Nanyang Tutorial School has set up individual tutoring classes every Saturday and Sunday to help students from various schools improve their studies. It provides detailed guidance according to the subjects and levels that the students intend to study, which is of great benefit to the students. It is heard that the opening date has been set for March 6th, and the time is from 4:00 pm to 10:00 pm every day. Except for the individual tutoring classes, every week is from Monday to Friday. Recently, the number of people who have been asking for brochures and registering has been quite enthusiastic.</p>

<p>The Audience Clamored and Threw Seats</p>
<p>The Referee Declared Maihong the Winner</p>
<p>The Western Youth basketball game between Hualian and Mai Linghong started at 9 pm last night. No fewer than eight hundred people, all eager to see the game, watched from the sidelines. This was even more crowded than the game between Hua University and Bailao. The referees were Zhai Honglu and Bolang. The competition between the two sides was extremely fierce. In the first half, Maihong took the lead with 33 points to 25. After changing sides, Maihong continued to lead. When the score reached 61 to 42, with only ten seconds remaining in the game, Wang Erde and Shen Yugong suddenly had a conflict. The audience clamored, and the game could not continue. The referee announced Maihong the winner. The audience repeatedly berated the referee.</p>
<p>Disrupting Order</p>
<p>Throwing seats at the end was inappropriate. At the beginning of the game, Hualian's Shen and Li scored continuously, and Ren and Kong each made a free throw, taking a quick lead of 6 to 0. The momentum was overwhelming. Muer scored, and Zhenzhong made a free throw. Maihong suddenly turned the tide, adding 11 points to take the lead with 13 to 7. After that, Maihong took the lead step by step, and Hualian followed closely. When Zhaoxiong came on, Zhenzhong made contributions. At the end of the first half, Maihong had 33 points and Hualian had 25. After the break, Guiqi and Ti Luo each made contributions. When the score was 45 to 37, Guangyi was fouled out four times. At 51 to 40, Muer was also fouled out. After Sailituo and Li Zhenzhong each scored a goal, Paiman scored three consecutive goals, and then was fouled out. Boluntuo made a basket, and the shamanic dispute arose. At that time, there were only ten seconds left.</p>
<p>The Game Ends</p>
<p>Maihong won with 61 points to 42. The sports director of the association, Bolatuo, said that the Western Youth League was purely to promote sports and did not favor any team. The referees hired were all experienced. The audience should not make things difficult for them and should not damage the association's gym. Although there were ten seconds left in the game, the referee had the right to declare the end of the game. In short, he expressed his deep regret for this unfortunate incident. In addition, Maijin and Youlian won two games. The results of yesterday's game and the final battle are recorded below.</p>

<p>The Private Shanghai Cup Soccer Tournament Concludes</p>
<p>Samsung Wins the Championship</p>
<p>Yesterday's Final Decisive Match</p>
<p>Defeats Yousheng 1-0</p>
<p>The final decisive match of the Private Shanghai Cup soccer tournament, Samsung vs. Yousheng, was held at the school's stadium yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. The referee was Shen Huichun. Nearly a thousand spectators attended, creating an unusually enthusiastic atmosphere. After the initial contact, Yousheng launched an attack but was blocked. Samsung countered, and Yan Shijin passed the ball forward. Jin Peigen advanced along the side and hooked it into the goal. Wu Shaotai acted too hastily, shooting over the crossbar, missing a great opportunity. It was a pity. After 20 minutes, Wu Shaotai dribbled the ball forward but was blocked. He passed it through a gap to Jin Peigen, who shot from ten yards away, hitting the net. The first half ended with Samsung leading 1-0. After changing sides, the competition between the two sides was fierce, and the performance was exceptionally wonderful. Neither side scored. As time ran out, Samsung defeated Yousheng 1-0 to win the championship. Two friendly matches were also held. Jingxing defeated Baimen A 3-0. Jingxing led 2-0 in the first half. In another match, Baimen B vs. Mixed, although Baimen B had Jia Youliang, Cao Qiuting, and Xu Chengxun, Mixed also had Zhang Mingsheng, Tan Fugen, and Prometheus Rongzhong. The two sides were evenly matched, and the battle was difficult to resolve. In the first half, Zeng Rongzhong of Mixed fouled, and Cao Qiuting scored a nine-yard penalty, giving Baimen B a 1-0 lead. In the second half, Zhang Mingsheng equalized. In the last five minutes, Zeng Rongzhong scored a goal, sealing the victory. As a result, Baimen B lost to Mixed 2-1.</p>

<p>Chu Minyi Suggests to the Ministry of Education</p>
<p>Sending a National Martial Arts Delegation to Participate in the World Games</p>
<p>And Perform in Various Countries After the Games Conclude</p>
<p>Chu Wishes to Take on the Preparatory Affairs for the National Games in Shanghai</p>
<p>China has decided to send football and basketball teams to participate in the 12th World Games. Chu Minyi sent a telegram to the Ministry of Education the day before yesterday, requesting special attention to martial arts and organizing a martial arts delegation to perform at the Games. The original telegram is excerpted below:</p>
<p>To Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education in Chongqing, Deputy Ministers Gu and Zhang, and forwarded to Dean Dai, Brother Li Tao, and Brother Wang Rutang: The 12th World Games is scheduled to be held in Finland next year. China should participate as usual. Recalling the results of participating in the previous Games, all kinds of competitions were behind others. Fortunately, the martial arts performance was welcomed by foreigners and brought a lot of glory. This session should pay special attention to this. All organizations and athletes should be wider in scope and better in quality than last time. Regarding the tasks in Shanghai, if entrusted, I will do my best to serve. I hope that the results of this fully prepared will bring international honor, and the martial arts delegation can take this opportunity to perform in various countries after the Games to promote China's inherent martial spirit, which is also conducive to the propaganda of the War of Resistance and national construction. Are these ideas appropriate? How should it be carried out? Please consider and reply by telegram. Your brother, Chu Minyi.</p>

<p>Children's Weekly: A Person Cannot Be Shameless  Jun Peng</p>
<p>Shame is something everyone should have. In other words, "A person cannot be shameless."</p>
<p>Children! The two words "shame" are very important to our "character" and are connected and inseparable. Look! There is a person who is so poor at home that he has no food to eat. Isn't he going to starve to death? Is he just going to sit and wait for death? So he thinks of stealing money from the wealthy man next door. If he steals the money, he can live. But if he is caught, he will be sent to the government to face charges. There are also people who gather a group of companions to become robbers. But once they are caught by the government, needless to say, they will be sentenced to life imprisonment or even executed! Children! Do you think it's scary? Why did he become a thief? Why did he become a robber? Of course, it was for survival, but unfortunately, he took the wrong path in life. On the one hand, it is a social pathology, taking risks due to unemployment; on the other hand, most are blinded by greed, forgetting "shame."</p>
<p>In school, you must pay great attention to character, and it must be very strict. But when you find something on the ground, do you return it to the owner? Have you ever lied to your classmates? Are you loyal? Are you diligent in your studies? Or are you not paying attention? Have you ever stolen anything from others? These many questions for reflection must be asked of yourself every day. The punishment of conscience is the most painful. Children! If we steal things from others, we are thieves. If we tell lies, we are deceiving ourselves. If we don't study diligently, we are letting down our teachers, our parents, and ourselves. We must know that robbers and thieves cannot be tolerated, even without legal sanctions, where is our personality? Personality is the second life and is even more important than life because there is a saying: "One wrong step leads to eternal regret; it is too late to turn back after a hundred years!" Experience it deeply!</p>
<p>Making a Rabbit Lantern with Duck Eggshells  Xinsheng</p>
<p>Once the Spring Festival holiday arrives, children inevitably follow their parents to stroll down the street. Some younger brothers and sisters are attracted by the colorful paper lanterns and inevitably clamor to buy them. As a result, it's always a costly expense.</p>
<p>Here, I will teach children how to make eggshell lanterns. I think you must have the time to make some to play with. You can practice your handicrafts, and you can give them to your younger siblings to play with. Why wouldn't you do such a win-win task?</p>
<p>The main material for making the lantern is, of course, a duck eggshell. Open a hole in the side (middle) of the duck egg and trim it with scissors (Figure 1). This is the body of the rabbit. There are two ways to make the rabbit's head: Figure 2 is three-dimensional; Figure 3 is a single piece, which needs to be glued together on both sides and then glued to the eggshell along the dotted line. In Figures 2 and 3, the rabbit ears and eyes are drawn on the original paper. If you cut the two ears separately and then glue them to the top of the head, and then thread thin bamboo strips through the eyes, and thread two swollen soybeans on both ends of the bamboo strips, and then dye the soybeans red with red ink, the shape of the head will be more vivid. The rabbit's tail is a small piece of cotton, glued to the other end of the eggshell with glue.</p>
<p>After the rabbit's whole body is made, we can prepare the lamp. There are two types of lamps: one is a hanging type (Figure 4), drill four small holes around the opening of the eggshell, and tie them with four thin copper wires. In this way, it can be hung. If you want to hold it, prepare another bamboo pole and tie the copper wire to the head of the bamboo pole. The other type is a towed type (Figure 5), use cardboard to paste a rectangular paper box that is slightly larger than the matchbox core, thread two thin bamboo poles through the side of the box in parallel, to serve as an axle, and then use four wooden abandoned chess pieces, each with a small hole drilled in the center, and insert them on both ends of the bamboo pole to form a small car with two pairs of wheels. Then glue the finished rabbit body inside the car, and then install a small ring in front of the car, so that you can tie the line to tow it.</p>
<p>The rabbit lamp can be dyed in various colors, colorful and bright are the most suitable. Because it is a toy, you don't need to worry about its natural body color. The lamp's internal lighting device is very simple, you only need to find a small iron pot for oil paste, and then cut a round iron sheet, and use cotton thread as the wick; fill the box with a little soybean oil to be used as fuel. This oil lamp is placed inside the eggshell. (As shown in Figure 6)</p>
<p>From the above rabbit lantern, we can also make: goldfish lanterns, duck lanterns, airplane lanterns and car lanterns. The front end of the goldfish lantern should be made into two protruding eyeballs, and in addition, install a paper star and a pair of soft paper fins for the chest, abdomen, buttocks, and back can be omitted: The head and tail of the duck lamp can refer to the rabbit lamp's production method; The airplane lamp's fuselage should be made of cardboard glued to the eggshell; The above three types are hanging type, the last one is a car lamp which is towed type, and its production method is simpler than the rabbit lamp, only need to install two car lights at its front end, and then install a car window in the middle to complete it. The colors of the above various eggshell lanterns can be arranged by yourself, but you must pay attention to the average weight before and after. I think the children will also be able to turn out other more fun eggshell lanterns!</p>
<p>Passing the Pond Company (Continued)  Bai Zheng</p>
<p>The manager of the company and Mr. Li were from the same hometown. They were talking in Anhui dialect, which Ming'er couldn't understand. They talked for a long time. Later, Mr. Li said to Ming'er's father: "Recently, the situation here is very tense. The boats in the Qiantang River have been seized for military use, and the price of boats has soared, almost doubling the usual price. Because those boatmen are very timid and dare not come here. I have asked him to think of a solution for us."</p>
<p>People were constantly entering and leaving the company. Some were carrying large packages out, and some were carrying things in. The staff members held a string of bamboo sticks and gave each porter a stick. Ming'er wanted to go up. He was sure that each stick was the price of each decision. He watched silently from the side.</p>
<p>Mr. Li asked the manager to prepare their dinner. Before long, four bowls of dishes were placed on the table, two meat and two vegetarian. Ming'er was already very hungry, and there was never such a rich meal on the small boat. Therefore, he sat down unceremoniously. At that time, the drool in his mouth was about to slide from the corner of his mouth, but he restrained himself. That night, he ate heartily.</p>
<p>Ming'er's father and Mr. Zhang and Li went out to inquire about the recent battles. Ming'er also followed his father. In a grocery store, there was a radio broadcasting news of the war. They stood and listened for more than ten minutes. The news of the war did not disappoint them too much. They quickly returned to the company, hoping to get a boat tonight and leave here, because this place was not suitable for a long stay.</p>
<p>Becoming a Little Radio Expert (3)  Xi Ren</p>
<p>(2) Knowing Parts</p>
<p>"Then what is the use of a capacitor?" Wang Min asked. "The use of a capacitor is to store electricity, so it is called capacitance. Capacitance means that it can accumulate electricity." His cousin paused and said, "Capacitors can be divided into two types. One is fixed, called a fixed capacitor (see Figure 1 in the previous issue). The other is adjustable, called a variable capacitor."</p>
<p>"Then are there only these two styles of capacitors?" Wang Min quickly continued his cousin's words and asked.</p>
<p>"No, there are more than these two styles of capacitors. The adjustable ones also have three-gang and four-gang types, which are made by connecting three or four adjustable capacitors together to form a single capacitor." His cousin took out a handkerchief to wipe his nose and continued, "But this kind of capacitor is only used in large radios. We will talk about it later. Oh, I forgot to tell you that these capacitors are available in radio shops. But the people in the shop call it a 'condenser.' As long as you say 'condenser,' they will give you a capacitor."</p>
<p>After saying a lot, Wang Min didn't say a word. His cousin turned around to look at him and saw that he had opened his mouth and was listening intently, so he couldn't help but laugh and say, "Hey, Min, what are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Oh, brother, I'm listening to you," Wang Min said happily. "I already know a little about capacitors. I think you can teach me again this afternoon…" Wang Min hadn't finished speaking when his mother came to call them for lunch. His cousin said, "Let's go eat. We'll talk about something else this afternoon."</p>
<p>Wang Min's mother made a lot of dishes because Wang Min's cousin rarely came. Wang Min ran back to the side room after only eating one bowl of rice because he only remembered his cousin talking about the radio. He picked up various things and looked at them by himself, but he didn't understand anything. He only saw all kinds of things filling a table.</p>
<p>He unintentionally picked up something round with pointed ends (see Figure 2A). While he was looking at it, his cousin ran in. He ran forward and asked his cousin, "Brother, what is this called?"</p>
<p>His cousin picked up the thing in Wang Min's hand and looked at it and said, "Oh, is this it? It's called a mineral. Haven't you heard of a mineral radio? A mineral radio must use this." His cousin put the thing with pointed ends on the table and then picked up something like Figure 2B on the side and continued, "There are several kinds of minerals. The one you just saw is called a fixed mineral." His cousin raised the thing he was holding in his hand and said, "This is called a variable mineral, but there are two kinds of variable minerals. One is covered with glass (see Figure 2C)." As his cousin spoke, his eyes saw something wound up with something like a wire, and he pointed to it and said to Wang Min, "Do you know what this is called?"</p>
<p>Wang Min replied, "I don't know."</p>
<p>His cousin said, "This is called a coil. It is the most important thing in a radio. There are two kinds of coils: one is wound with a paper board like a spider web, called a spider web coil; the other is wound with a cylinder, called a cylindrical coil (see Figure 3)." His cousin paused here and then continued: "Now, almost all the parts for a simple radio have been discussed, except for a headset. A headset is something that is put on the ears and has two black circles (see Figure 4)."</p>
<p>The Story of Mud  Ailian</p>
<p>On the bank of a small river, there was an ordinary, rough, and heavy clod of mud. Although it was so ordinary, it often fantasized about its great value, and there would eventually be an opportunity to be discovered in this wonderful world.</p>
<p>Initially, in the warm sunlight of spring, plants gradually awakened, revealing their flowers and leaves, whispering to each other about their future glory. Forests also grew on the beautiful earth, adorned with millions of tiny rubies and green jade scattered among the light, drifting clouds. Vivid flowers brought shocking joy as they bowed their necks and whispered to their sisters when caressed by the gentle breeze, "You are so lovely, making this day bright and radiant."</p>
<p>The meandering river also joyfully kept time, striking against the riverbank, producing musical tones, telling how they had gained freedom from the ice's confinement, with new vitality flowing down from the snow-capped mountains, stirring the water wheels in the mill, doing great work, and making the huge ships drift on the vast ocean.</p>
<p>At that time, the mud waited dumbly on the bank for its opportunity, comforting itself that it would have a valuable future. "My opportunity will come," it said to itself. "I will not be buried forever. This season, honor, beauty, and praise undoubtedly belong to me."</p>
<p>One day, the mud felt a flat iron shovel under itself, lifting it up from the place where it had waited for so long, and throwing it into a cart with another pile of mud. The cart took it away. After going through rugged mountain roads, enduring many bumps, it was not afraid at all, but encouraged itself: "This is necessary. The road to glory must have bumps. Now I am on the road to contributing to the world."</p>
<p>Although this journey was difficult, nothing more painful followed. It was placed in a narrow trough, mixed, hammered, stirred, and trampled, which almost made it unbearable. But it was full of hope - only after this hardship could there be a beautiful and valuable result, so it received great comfort in its spirit. So it waited deeply, even thinking that the perfect result was prepared for it.</p>
<p>Then it was placed on a light spinning wheel, it worried that such a fast spin would split its body into thousands of pieces. Then there was a great pressure and a mold added to its body, and after another spin, it felt a dizziness and pain, and it became another appearance.</p>
<p>A hand, no one knows whose, put it in the stove. The fire was so blazing - terrible and sharp - hotter than the shore in the hot summer. After all this hardship, it could endure it like this, because it believed that it would have a great future. "Of course," it thought, "I am willing to suffer, as long as I become a gorgeous item. Perhaps I am an ornament in a chapel, or a precious vase in front of the emperor."</p>
<p>Later, this baking process was over. It was taken out of the oven and placed on a wooden board. It saw the blue sky, and in this cool air, it felt comfortable all over. Ah! The suffering is over! Glory is near!</p>
<p>Next to the wooden board, there was a not very clear pool, but it was still enough to reflect the shadow. At first, when it was picked up, it saw its new look from the pool - this was the reward for patience and suffering, its expectations were fulfilled - an ordinary vase, hard and straight, red and ugly. It felt that it would not be displayed in the emperor's palace or the palace of art, because it was made so unbeautifully. It was deeply dissatisfied and complained to its maker: "Why did you make me like this?"</p>
<p>It was depressed and unhappy for many days. Later, it felt that it was full of soil, and there was something brown and rough, like death, placed in the soil. It was prepared to resist this new shame. "I am full of dirty waste. This is obviously bad for me. I am undoubtedly a failure."</p>
<p>But now it was placed in the greenhouse, where the sun gently caressed it, and clear water irrigated it. It waited for opportunities every day. Suddenly, it felt that something inside it was moving - this was brand new hope. But it remained ignorant, not understanding the meaning of this new hope.</p>
<p>One day, it was picked up again and taken to a solemn chapel. Its expectations had indeed come. It occupied a good position in the world. Glorious music played. Many flowers surrounded it, making it confused. It gently asked a vase nearby, "Why did they put me here? Why are so many people looking at us?" The vase replied, "Don't you know? Your belly brings the emperor's precious lilies, with their snow-white petals and golden hearts. So many people are looking at them because they are the most peculiar in the world. Their roots are in your belly, and you are so glorious!"</p>
<p>Finally, the mud was greatly satisfied, deeply grateful to its maker,</p>
<h3 id="e123">Grain Prices: Flour Mills Rush to Manufacture, Anticipating Flour Adjustments; Wheat Market Merely Ornamental <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The flour market has not seen any special changes. Due to the weekend period, merchant demand is slow to move. In recent days, both northern and southern merchants have transacted a total of 200,000 bags of various brands of flour, all of which need to be transported and loaded successively. Flour mills are rushing to manufacture to meet the demand, in order to supply the market. It is heard that sales during the New Year period in this street were also quite good. The wholesale price of old brands, including the delivery cost, is 4.805 yuan per bag. The retail cash price is 4.65 yuan per bag. It is also heard that flour mills are expected to make adjustments for the merchants' futures flour orders but are very firm on sales in this street. Yesterday, transactions in this street were estimated at about 7,000 to 8,000 bags. Transactions from the Shandong, Hebei, and Shantou merchants totaled about 30,000 bags. The market is still brewing. Yesterday, 41,000 bags of flour were shipped to Shantou.</p>
<p>Wheat market transactions continue to be sluggish. The day before yesterday, only 3,000 bags were opened for trading. Yesterday, the market only opened with 400 bags. This is because the mills currently have imported wheat arriving, and the need for local wheat is naturally not strong. However, the owners of the goods are holding onto prices due to high costs and lack of spot goods, resulting in few transactions and only serving as a mere ornament to the market. The total sales included two types of wheat, Yangzhou and Nanjing wheat, amounting to only 400 bags, all of which were purchased by the Fufeng Mill. The Fuxin Mill made no purchases yesterday. The market has become ordinary.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Speculators Actively Purchase Du Rice in the Afternoon <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's supply of domestic rice from Heshang only arrived at the fourth warehouse, with over 3,000 bags transported by trucks. The initial market was quite sluggish, with only this street being slightly active. However, after purchases by speculators in the evening, the market turned from sluggish to tight. As a result, various types of goods showed mixed trends. Thick japonica rice rose slightly for northern merchants, while there was not much change for southern merchants. The path for special grade thin rice was relatively strong, showing a good trend. Medium-grade rice was slightly weak. Du foreign rice, pointed rice, and top-quality goods were scarce and also saw a slight increase of a few cents to a dime. The increased price of Biànyuán rice reduced demand slightly, and the price turned stable.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Early Rice Continues to Rise Outside the Corners <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's arrival of early rice was very scarce, and stores and brokers have already begun to inquire. Due to high costs and production prices not being low, owners insisted not to sell easily. Therefore, the entire day's transactions did not exceed 2,000 bags, and prices continued to rise. Nanjing high early rice opened at 11.5 yuan, while Wu early rice opened at 11.1 yuan. Newly arrived Taixing machine early rice also opened at 11.25 yuan. Although current inventory in Shanghai is sufficient, transporting it is quite profitable. Moreover, merchants from Hangzhou, Ningbo, and other regions have demand. Therefore, stores and speculators are even more hopeful about the market.</p>
<h3 id="e126">North-South Goods: Lychees and White Lotus Seeds; Spring Dishes All Firm <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the first batch of Jinshan lychees from Hong Kong firms opened for trading. Top-grade round lychees were priced at 62.2 yuan, and flat lychees were priced at around 63 yuan, with subsequent grades slightly lower. Glutinous rice lychees opened at 153 yuan, and Chen Hainan pulp opened at 43 yuan. New goods were not transacted due to unreasonable counter-offers. However, given the thin inventory and firm base, if demand continues, there is a definite possibility of further price increases in the future market.</p>
<p>Lanxi white lotus seeds do not have many arrivals and inventory, and the market is firm. A small amount was offered yesterday. Those with better color were priced at 100 yuan, and those of secondary quality were priced at 97 yuan. There was a batch of Hunan lotus seeds from a merchant, sold through brokers. The merchants' offer was still 4 to 5 yuan short, and no transaction was made.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Building Materials: Foreign Pine Has Little Change; Hardware Inevitably Hoarded <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Building materials are mostly domestic, but foreign goods occupy a significant position in hardware. Due to tight foreign exchange and rising prices, people are optimistic and inevitably hoarding. Therefore, prices for this spring's trading all see rises. Although foreign pine is a foreign good, it is constrained by domestic pine and fir wood, and prices are inevitably suppressed.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Coal: 2,000 Tons of New White Coal Unsuitable to be Sold <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>The white coal business sees a decline in sales due to the reduced use of stoves. Therefore, at the beginning of the New Year's trading, Hongji white coal remained unchanged at 45 yuan per ton. Unexpectedly, on the second day of trading, due to the small initial arrival of goods, buyers eagerly purchased them. The new 2,000 tons were not enough to meet the sales demand, and the owners seized the opportunity to raise prices. Hongji medium chunks were priced at 47 yuan per ton, screened chunks at 49 yuan, and roasted chunks at 51 yuan. Delivery by the Yangjingbang carts of the same trade incurred additional handling fees.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Miscellaneous Grains: Bran Manipulation Fails <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The bran market situation has been like a rudderless boat, with people feeling uneasy. Although skilled manipulators have employed their usual tactics, the strategy of using Chinese to control Chinese has ultimately failed. Yesterday's situation showed a slight relaxation, with the Guandao market falling back and the company showing signs of wavering. In the market yesterday, only 4,000 bags of old warehouse receipts for small packages from Fufeng Huafeng were transacted at 3.2 yuan, an increase of 2.5 cents compared to the previous market. Today, 1,000 bags of bran will be shipped to Shantou.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Hardware: Sales to Out-of-Town Merchants Particularly Strong <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Since the prices of various types of hardware gradually rose after the beginning of the year's trading, and because only half of the local factories in Shanghai have resumed operations, sales have been scarce. However, sales to merchants from out of town have been particularly strong. Merchants from Tianjin, Yantai, and Qingdao have purchased large quantities. For example, No. 26 Da Ma Kou tinplate sold for 120 to 130 yuan per box, with over a hundred boxes reportedly sold. Other items, such as new steel plates, new lead wire, angle iron, black iron sheets, plain white iron, round nails, and iron from new and old steel mills, such as US Steel, were also purchased in large quantities. Prices were similar to the beginning of the year.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Silk and Tea: Factory Prices Have Soared by 400 Yuan in the Last Four Decades <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market continued to advance in a rising trend. Foreign firms sold 7-8 grade raw silk at 1,720 yuan, not considering it a good price. Ordinary raw silk for domestic users, such as the TH brand, has been sold at 1,000 yuan. Jili silk, the Python brand, is priced at 1,020 yuan. Market expectations are for further advances. According to the statistics of the Foreign Silk Association, the average price of 7-8 grade R-brand raw silk in the first half of February has soared 280 yuan compared to the first half of January (the price before January 15 was 1,300 yuan, and the price before February 15 was 1,580 yuan). From February 15 to the recent ten days, the same grade of raw silk has soared another 140 yuan. Such a rise can be described as unprecedented. The increase in the rate of the Jili silk XA grade is quite alarming. The price in the first half of January was 810 yuan, the price in the first half of February was 920 yuan, and the current selling price has soared another 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the overseas silk market remained firm. Although the exchange rates in the Japanese and American exchanges slightly decreased, the actual sales prices in New York all opened at the original price, and prices in Lyon all rose. In terms of silk sales in Shanghai, foreign firms sold 50 loads of raw silk, printing houses sold 20 loads of local silk, and domestic users sold 25 loads. Market prices were all tighter than before. Both buyers and sellers still consider these transactions to be auspicious for the new year.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 12 pieces of Huzhou silk and 998 boxes of tea were shipped to Europe.</p>

<p>Eastern textiles are slightly stable.</p>
<p>Domestic cloth sales are scarce and the market is weak. This is because both local and out-of-town cloth merchants have gained substantial profits in the past year, with abundant funds and inventory accumulating at double the previous rate. This inevitably exceeds demand. Additionally, during the new year's trading period, Zhejiang Province issued warnings, and goods pre-ordered by the Wen and Yong merchants from the previous year all remained in Shanghai and were unwilling to be shipped. Yesterday, Sichuan and Yunnan also stopped purchasing goods due to congestion in coastal defense warehouses. However, ports in Shantou, Hong Kong, Guangzhou Bay, and the Fujian coast are all unobstructed, and purchases are still made sporadically. Merchants from the northern route of Tianjin purchased nearly 200 boxes of plain silk, woolen cloth, blue cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth. Wholesale shops in this street are selectively replenishing products in response to the new year's season, as they had a successful business last year. Dafeng, Hengfeng, Central, and Lunchang factories sold two hundred and several tens of boxes of dark-colored and white-ground satin crepe printed fabric. Merchants from Jiangxi purchased forty to fifty pieces of fine cloth, bleached cloth, and printed cloth from brands such as Dapeng. Market prices for white fine cloth and fine twill were 10 to 20 cents lower than the beginning of the year's trading, and dyed and processed goods were also reduced by 10 to 30 cents. However, printed goods were relatively firm, and white-ground satin crepe was out of stock. Lunchang printed cloth increased by 5 cents, and straight tribute satin increased by 2 dimes. The surge in gold prices increased the manufacturing cost of fabrics, so people in general are still optimistic.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market for white goods in eastern textiles was slightly stable. Although sales remained sluggish in terms of actual sales, factories and merchants insisted on not relaxing on futures orders. Large firms remain optimistic, and retail investors have limited short-selling power. Therefore, sales prices for fine cloth and fine twill have slightly turned upward, with fine cloth shouting higher by 2.5 to 5 cents per piece. Fine twill has no gains or losses, and it is on the path to stability. Retail customers in this street purchased more than 400 pieces of spot goods.</p>
<p>Today, 400 pieces of textiles will be exported to Shantou, 2 pieces to Hong Kong, and 110 pieces to Guangzhou.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the seventh day of the Lunar New Year, and the woolen cloth and flannel industries all opened for business on the fifth day of the lunar month. Yesterday, brokers ran around taking samples, which was quite busy. Looking at the prices in general, the market prices were all higher than the closing prices by 5 to 10 cents of silver. Fellow merchants are very optimistic. However, buyers’ purchases were limited because (1) the opening price was too high, (2) merchants had made considerable profits last year and they made more search and absorption than in previous years, and (3) there real sales are still pending after the Lantern Festival. Due to these three reasons, most people have adopted a wait-and-see attitude, so there were not many large-scale transactions.</p>

<p>Zhou Bangjun Broadcasts Yesterday Regarding the refugee education fund-raising association.</p>
<p>Zhou Bangjun gave a speech in the refugee association fund-raising, hosted at the Daya Broadcast station. Zhou said the reason that people need to be taught because the problem with raising refugees is that they depend on the donations forever, when things settle down the problem wont be solved and they are still asking for donations. The teaching program is doing something about that, and making sure the refugees have a way to make a living from what they have learned. With the help of the public, they can carry this out smoothly.</p>

<p>— Huang Shijin</p>
<p>(2) The Current Situation of In-Service Secondary School Teachers</p>
<p>What is the current situation of secondary school teachers in our country? Several people have conducted investigations. According to Mr. Tong Runzhi, only 15% of teachers nationwide have received professional training in the past. Among ten teachers, eight do not understand what education is, and three are teaching secondary school students with a secondary school education. Education in Zhejiang Province is known to be developed, but according to the statistics of the province in the 20th year of the Republic of China, the qualifications of teachers in secondary schools throughout the province are also not sound. Those who have graduated from normal universities and higher normal schools account for only 10.44%. In 1935, Mr. Zheng Xigu was commissioned by the China Education Society to study the issue of secondary school teacher training. According to his statistics, currently, teachers in secondary schools with university degrees account for 40.28% of the total, graduates of specialized schools account for 14.11%, graduates of higher normal schools or specialized courses account for 2.99%, graduates of domestic normal universities or colleges of education account for 11.35%, and those who have studied abroad and obtained degrees account for 5.02%. From the above figures, we can know that most of the current secondary school teachers in our country are unqualified and lack professional training.</p>
<p>Someone analyzed various professions in society and found that there are only four specialized professions that take "people" as their work object: doctors, lawyers, pastors, and teachers. Doctors work to save lives, lawyers work to protect human rights, pastors work to cultivate people, and teachers work to improve life. People who engage in these four types of work must receive professional training in order to achieve something. In Europe and the United States, the qualifications and status of these four professions are highly valued. In our country, there is no tolerance for doctors who prescribe the wrong medicine and lawyers who misjudge cases, but there is no attention paid to teachers who mislead young people. This is a serious oversight. Is it that the treatment of diseases requires professional doctors, the judgment of laws requires professional lawyers, but the cultivation of personality and the training of thought do not require professional teachers? This shows that we have put the cart before the horse, regarding the body as more important than character and property as more valuable than personality. We should know that modern teachers are different from those in ancient times. Since the evolution of modern political organization, the state has taken on the responsibility of education. At the same time, education has been regarded as a tool for implementing national policies and a path to revitalizing the nation. Therefore, modern teachers cannot be dismissed by anyone who has received a little general education. Mr. Zheng’s survey of the opinions of 46 middle school principals pointed out many weaknesses of incumbent teachers, such as (A) in terms of knowledge, (1) lack of professional knowledge, (2) lack of education knowledge, (3) inability to thoroughly understand the subject they teach because they do not teach what they have learned, etc.; (B) in terms of skills, (1) lack of training in teaching skills, (2) only knowing how to teach books but not learning guidance, (3) lack of management skills to maintain classroom order, lack of industrial skills to manufacture teaching aids, etc.; (C) in terms of ideals, (1) lack of sense of responsibility, (2) lack of spirit of cooperation, (3) inconsistency in words and deeds and inability to set an example, (4) only seeking perfunctory performance and not assuming the responsibility of training, (5) lack of educational beliefs and the determination to devote themselves to education for life, etc.; (D) in other aspects, (1) lack of sound physical fitness, (2) lack of proper hobbies, etc. From this, it can be seen that the current situation of incumbent secondary school teachers in our country is unsatisfactory.
