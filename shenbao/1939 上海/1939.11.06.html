<h3 id="c14">日本最新之失敗 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>「事實最雄辯」，凡百宣傳以事實爲最佳之資料，凡百主張以事實爲最强之論據，信用以事實爲最確鑿之保證，誠僞是非利害得失則以事實爲最切最後之判斷。於是狡黠者亟亟於造就利己之事實，造而不就則僞飾爲事實，事實不利於已則隱蔽歪曲其事實。故譸張爲幻，輒爲視聽之魔障，而役於感情者且喪其聰明而墮入魔障。事關小己立身處世者旣不可不明察事實，謀國允然。</p>
<p>日本對於中日問題，確乎粘滯於無辦法之中。彼於軍事攻勢，外交攻勢，政治攻勢，先後赴以全力，且有時而三路並進，今則已入三路失敗之階段。以軍事攻勢言之：凡百戰爭，雖必以和平爲結局，然在發動戰爭者，決非旨在謀和而必志在制勝；日本侵華，決非以和華爲目的而必以勝華爲目的，此非詖辭可蔽者也。及彼苦戰兩年有餘而至今茲，非不能再作數决進攻，亦非必不能再佔數處城鎭；然日本必以擊破中國主力，使中國不復能抗戰，壓迫中國作城下之盟，始得完成其侵華戰勝之局。世有懷疑於中國能吾最後勝利者，姑勿作何解釋，然日本之絕對不能以軍事完成其勝利，此則種種當前之事實可作鐵證。故以軍事攻勢論，日本確是已經失敗；所待方來之事實更爲證明者，日本侵略之最後失敗而已。</p>
<p>以外交攻勢言之：日本對於中日問題，目無他國，以爲必可獨力主宰遠東；故七八年來，日本以與德國相呼應相配合爲彼在國際之唯一積極工作；此外，對較弱者恣意侮弄，對較强者虛事委蛇而已。去年杪與本年初，美英法三國相繼作强硬之抗議，日本置之不理，可爲明證也。及至最近半年，軍事攻勢失敗之跡象漸著，不自反省而遷怒於各國之援華，於是變更其不理會態度，以猙獰之面目，作外交之進攻；鼓浪嶼事件與天津事件皆此作風也；試探結果，徒以自暴其猙獰。及七月下旬，美國宣告廢止美日商的，日本漸知各國之決不放棄遠東，坐視强暴；漸知國際壓力之與日俱增，漸知往日虛僞宣傳之未爲各國所接受；方謀別覓機緣，以反共公的之强化爲外交反攻之工具，乃突爲德國所遺棄；阿部內閣之野村外交實以此爲生命。顧事實何似乎？儘作欲擒故縱之姿態，再三聲言暫不擬與英美進行談判，而談判之進行自若；滿望於進行談判之或有所獲，而昨日東京朝日新聞記述野村外相接受美國大使之備忘錄，知「前途極其黯澹」云。不惟美國如此而已，日本以英國有事於歐洲而爲可欺；乃日前倫敦電稱，英國駐日大使將在東京進行談判，英國不擬變更態度，故未予大使以何種新訓令云。即此二端，可知日本外交攻勢之失敗。所待方來之事實更爲證明者，國際對日之進一步行動而已；度以大勢，時不在遠。</p>
<p>以政治攻勢言之；日本在長春，在北平南京，數年來扶植傀儡政權，不遺餘力，此在日本之本意，亦政治攻勢也；顧乃事實所示，對中國不夠號召，對國際不夠欺騙。會逢軍事攻勢已至末路，於是發爲欺人之談曰：對華甩兵，非欲戰勝中國，乃謀與中國奠定和平也。夫奠定兩國之和平，茍其發於眞誠，是未可以政治攻勢目之，顧乃絕無事實可爲眞誠之證。反之，虛僞至不可掩飾。蓋奠定兩國和平云者：以主權完整之獨立自由國，爲「國」之絕對條件，以平等爲「兩國」之必然條件，以互信互惠相親相諒爲和平之正當基礎。彼於去年九月間之所謂外交聲明，十二月間之所謂近衛宣言，模稜浮泛，初不足爲切實圖謀解紛息爭之根據，顧日人所以自辯者，日原則固如是也，茲不遑申論。就三五日來東京所電傳，則日人之肺肝畢見矣。撮其耍點：日本所亟，在於整理其軍事佔領區域內之組織，非所謂謀和，更非所謂解決中日問題，此其一也。日本謂無領土要求，而於華北也，內蒙也，上海南京杭州之所謂三角地帶也、皆稱之爲特別區；名爲特別區者，實係變相之屬地，即名實皆不屬中國也，此其二也。日本謂尊重中國主權，然軍事方面，則在中國境內駐兵；在政治外交方面由強制加入反共集團，此其三也。日本謂不干涉內政，然於海關也，鐵路也，謂為「當然未便移交」，此其四也。即此四者，可知日本最近之圖謀，非所謂奠定和平，實僅為政治攻勢。推彼用意，政治攻勢實現之日，退為侵略軍事作金蟬脱壳之計，進為全盤侵略計畫作暗渡陳倉之謀；更以此「偽飾之形態」，置之各國之前，曰業「造就之事實」如此如此也，於以求「外交攻勢」之勝利。顧以吾人觀感：彼模稜之原則，在初步政治攻勢之中，容或有效，至於上述四項條件，則誰復屈從？於以推測日本宣傳之「新政權」也者，至多成為南京北平兩傀儡改組之局；以言政治攻勢，則又以上述四項條件而定告失敗矣。此固日本最新之失敗也。</p>

<p>歐戰最初兩月巳過去，並未使遠東貿易一般的興盛起來；且這種興盛，還很渺茫。英屬馬來和荷屬東印度確實能將數量增多的錫，橡皮，和其他熱帶農產品，運往歐洲和美國。在他方面，中日兩國的對外商業却大减，所减少的遠較南洋貿易所增加的為多。舊世界的戰事，巳進入第三個月，大體說來，遠東貿易的前瞻，還是杌隉不安，早日增加商業總額的希望很小。</p>
<p>九月與十月份的中國對外貿易，異常惡劣，東亞海面的協的國航運受限制，使原定運來上海的許多貨物，都在英法殖民地港口起岸。歐洲若干交戰和中立國家實行新的出口限制，將上海的若干種供應品來源完全閉斷。在他方面，中國法幣的漸趨堅强，英法遠東殖民地的貿易和匯兌新統制，和歐洲輸入的新限制，都使上海的出口品受到損害。中國第二個重要貿易甲心地天津，因本年秋季的洪水，商業所受損失極重，九月份的輸入較八月份减少百分之七十，輸出减少百分之九十四。同時，「自由中國」取道香港和法屬越南的過境貿易，因該兩地的新統制制度而遇到更多的困難。</p>
<p>這些發展的結果，中國的輸入，在八月份是海關金單位五三·九〇〇·〇〇〇，九月份跌到海關金單位三四·九〇〇·〇〇〇。同時，中國的輸出也自法幣一〇〇·九〇〇·〇〇〇元，降至八五·四〇〇·〇〇〇元。中國輸入品减落最劇的金屬，機械，車輛，金屬品，木材，紙張，糖類和烟草。輸出品的减少，以內地產物，允其是農業和牲畜產品為最多，來自德國的入口品的减半數；而中國口岸的德國航運，已完全停頓。</p>
<p>中國不能自泰西各國獲得一部份常用的供應品，當然是給日本犧牲他國而繼續擴張它對華貿易的絕好機緣，但是，恰巧日本本部近來的經濟發展，阻使日人不能利用這機緣。本年初秋，日本種種貨物，極度缺乏，使日本的輸出力史受損害，所以，九月份日本對華輸出的低落數，並不較中國自他國輸入貨物的降落數為少，日本所佔中國輸入總額的百分之三—，並未增進。</p>
<p>日本對日圓集團各國的輸出，今秋確告低落，日本不能按照種種開發計劃，而以機械和鋼鐵供給滿洲和華北，便不得不修改這些計劃，縮小計劃範圍，而延長時間，頻頻宜傳的滿洲工業開發五年計劃，也不得不放棄了。九月份全月，日本對日圓集團以外諸國的輸出，還能維持，但十月份便劇跌，自十月十一日到二十日這十天中，日本輸出價値日金九一·〇〇·〇〇〇元的貨物，此數較上月份最初十天减少二八，五〇〇·〇〇〇元，而較九月份最後十天：幾乎减少八五·〇〇〇·〇〇〇元。日本的輸入，在十月份最初十天內是日金八〇·八〇〇·〇〇〇元，其後的十天內，减至七二·九〇〇·〇〇〇元，日本貿易的實在减落，較所舉的這些數字大得多，因為英鎊跌價，日圓價値，巳跟着低落百分之二十左右。</p>
<p>歐戰爆發，滿洲大受損失，滿洲的重要輸出品是大豆及其產物豆油和豆餅，除日本本部外，最重要的顧客便是德國，協的國加以封鎖，使直接運往德國或載往中立口岸的這些產物，都受阻碍。已有載滿洲產物駛往漢堡的日輪若干艘，被英法海軍攔阻而押往協的國口岸起岸，日人便立刻代表滿洲和莫斯科從事談判，以期得到蘇聯的准許，而利用橫貫西伯利亞鐵路，大規模從事日德兩國的過境貿易。</p>
<p>日本滿洲和中國本部的九月份貿易既已大减，那末，香港的貿易也受重大挫頓，便不足驚異了，英國的遠東，向來以香港為大本營，這種航運的减少，允其使香港的商業受到損害。九月份香港輸出品値港幣四二·五〇〇·〇〇〇元，較八月份减少二·三〇〇·〇〇〇元，但香港的輸入，也自八月份的五二·一〇〇·〇〇〇元减至九月份的三九·九〇〇·〇〇〇元，幾乎低落四分之一。香港政府並不像英國其他殖民地一樣嚴格地在香港實行英國戰時貿易和櫃兌新統制，也許因為貿易已激减之故，英國在東方的一切領土中，香港保持着最大的經濟土自由。</p>
<p>遠在南方的新加坡貿易，似乎還盛，在海峽殖民地九月份的輸出入中；荷屬東印度，法屬越南和邏羅的過境貿易，確已低落。但英屬馬來自己的貿易却大增，橡皮和錫的輸出都增高，九月份新加坡輸出的錫，實較一個月前增六倍，而超過一萬噸的紀錄數字。報紙且傳新加坡受缺少航運便利之苦，但這一點英當局已加吾認。荷屬東印度的輸出業，允其是橡皮，錫，棕欖油，和椰子核，也都大增，但顧客寗願自巴達維亞和泗水直接運出，而不願取道新加坡，以免該地的英國貿易和匯兌新統制。</p>
<p>南洋諸國增加輸出若維持若干時而不衰，結果勢必使這些國家在經濟上激趨繁榮，並使東印度羣島的購買力大為增强，這一點似乎可為中日兩國打開新的輸出可能性。日本旣陷於商品短少和種種經濟統制的苦悶中，那末，上海的實業終必乘英屬馬來和荷屬東印度情况好轉之利，而得到良機，但除此以外，遠東貿易大規模的早日興盛，極少明顯的希望。中日戰爭繼續使中國遭蹂躪，也使日本的經濟資源極度涸竭，遠東兩主要國家，正在消耗各自的實力。</p>

<p>— 倫敦特約通告　叔棣</p>
<p>第二，波蘭應戰</p>
<p>比起德國的進攻波蘭來，允其令人感到出於意料之外的，却是波蘭的毅然應戰。這首先應當歸功於英國外交對波的成功；其决，方可歸功於波蘭本身抵抗情緖的高亢。波蘭這一次的戰，是為了牠本身而戰，但在另一面，却理論與實際都是一般的，確確實實的，是為了英，法，的利益而戰！</p>
<p>在這裹，我們有回溯一下德國進攻的前夜，波蘭態度的必要。</p>
<p>當八月下旬，「蘇德互不侵犯協定」簽字後的那些天內，德國的決定進攻波蘭正在喧囂塵上的時候，這時，在歐洲最忙碌的國家，首先是德國，其决是英，法。最鎭定的國家，首先是意大利，其决呢，也許有人說是蘇聯吧？並不然；而却是那個身當侵略之衝的波蘭！</p>
<p>這樣的時候，牠為什麽那樣的胸有成竹？——個濃重的疑團，一直地，籠罩着英，法，當局者們的思慮。因此，英，法，接二連三的「決不讓步」，「決無通融餘地」，「波蘭受到侵略時，就是英，法，捲入戰爭時」，……等等的宣言，就逐日地在發表着。然而波蘭方面的回嚮，却少得像空谷的足音。</p>
<p>與這同時，還有一個更大的暗影存在着，那就是：英，波，軍事談判的失敗。當大家目光集中在英，法，蘇，在莫斯科的軍事談判時，波蘭的軍事代表團，悄悄地，來到了倫敦。這一個代衣團的使命，最重要的；一，確定戰爭發生時英，法，助波的具體合作辦法，二，確定戰爭發生時蘇聯援助波蘭的具體辦法。波蘭主要的希望，仍然限於器械軍火的帮助，而允其側重於飛機及空軍。三，莫斯科談判裏，波蘭要求派代表列席。</p>
<p>這一個軍事談判，拖延了很久，而毫無結果；終於，在英，法，蘇，談判因蘇德協定而解散後，這一談判，也同樣地受到了無限期擱置。於是，正在這一個代表團宜稱着要離開英國的時候，德國開始進攻的前夕來臨了。</p>
<p>大家都知道，這些年來，波蘭國際地位的提高，大半得力於牠的八面玲瓏外交的運用；其精義，則是：騎牆於德，蘇，之間。現在呢，蘇，德，間是暫時有了緩衝的默契。而另一而，希特拉在表而上，勸英，法，不必過問波蘭，實際是，通過了意大利，在逼波蘭和德，意，沆瀣一氣。</p>
<p>這樣暗影憧　下，對於德國的進攻，波蘭到底取什麼態度呢？誰敢說！</p>
<p>然而，英國外交特別活躍起來了。第一個令許多人都吃了一驚的重大成功，却是「英波互助協定」的正式公佈；其决，不獨原在這裏的波蘭軍事代表團，是延長了留此期間，而同時又有另一批軍事人員，由華沙出發，踏上了到英國來的途程。</p>
<p>於是，在德國進攻時，事實揭曉了出來；波蘭終於應戰了！</p>
<p>到底在什麼一種決心和估計之下，波蘭採取應戰的舉措呢？這是這裏要大概地予以輪廓式描繪的題目。</p>
<p>如果我們把波蘭這一回應戰時抱負的性質，也單純地看成為反抗侵略，和中國這一次對日本戰爭似的，那我們就錯了。很顯然，波蘭的抱負，不僅僅是消極性的抵抗的；牠有牠更大的積極性質。近些年來，牠外交運用的成功，加上國內整軍經武的結果，波蘭早就露出向外發展的端緖，去年的强佔立陶宛領土和捷克領土的兩决舉措，事實上，僅僅是這一個傾向的小試其鋒。牠的未來擴展對象，大概首先是匈牙利，其次，是巴爾幹半島，再其次，是波羅的海沿岸各國，最後，是蘇聯的烏克蘭。</p>
<p>在牠這一决對德的交鬨裹，對英外交裏，以及最近對意大利的折衝裹，我們可以注意到，有一個非常令人注目的現象，那就是；處處在爭着上風，而且是固執地，有時是出奇地。這一個不很樸素的現象，也在說明着那個向外擴展的趨勢；否則的話，是不需要的</p>
<p>我們就種種方面來硏究，大概一直到德國開始進攻的時候，波蘭還在固執着一個信念，那是：德國決不至擴大戰局；頂多不過在奪取但澤和「走廊」地帶。如果這樣，波蘭絕不讓步。縱使軍事上受到頓挫，牠也當繼續地戰了下去，使德國陷入一種欲罷不能的境地。這一點，在對意大利的接洽裹，牠已預先明白地吿訴了意大利。那樣情形的話，德國終至會不是自動對波讓步，終結戰爭；就是經由莫索里尼調停而停戰。萬一這個情勢是可以出現的話，那末，此後，德國對但澤及「走廊」固然永遠無再談的機會；而在波蘭國際聲威那樣大增的情勢下，連波羅的海沿岸，當然成了牠的勢力圈；如果再能得志於匈牙利，那末，牠未來儘可與意大利平分春色於巴爾幹了。那就是波蘭最希望的情勢，以期實現牠這些年來的理想。（未完）</p>

<p>比數之接近、可覘球塲空氣之緊張、兩隊誼屬同根、故踢來極盡客氣、淸晰精彩、此為最滿意之表演、勝負固非比賽之最大目的也、裁判沈回春亦甚稱職滿意、至於勝負得失之因、可為述之如下、麗都人材平均而活潑、陸鍾恩江潮而外、攻守俱佳、東華前綫兩內鋒甚弱、因之聯絡攻力、為之大减、每有格格不入之苦、甚而陷於各個作戰、後防之三員大將秦陳莊、確較麗都為佳、昨陳洪光之表演、允為獨到、老將顏色猶在、秦必高獲救險球無數、因麗都前鋒之銳利、故東華之戰略、大都悉取守勢、因守卒兩度失陷、麗都前鋒昨似未盡展所長、而防綫中李孟蔣三員大將、從後接濟支撑、在形勢上亦佔得大便宜也、</p>

<h3 id="c51">司馬秤與市秤間之比率的再檢討　外棉折價之差歧點 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 張一凡</p>
<p>關於外棉的折價算式，可謂已絕無問題。本刋前昨兩期所舉各式，完全適用。但由此却發生另一個新問題。即司馬秤與巿秤間的折合率的問題。這或許是此决討論中的意外收穫。</p>
<p>驚奇的比率</p>
<p>數字是最眞實而不能絲毫假借的，這是誰都知道。度量衡異制間的折合率，照理更不容有絲毫差池。同時，正因數字是不能絲毫假借，所以折合率決不會發生不同的二個。如有二個，其中必有一錯，而錯的一個應被淘汰。</p>
<p>然而現在却竟發現兩個關於司馬秤及市秤間的不同折合率。一個是八一二扣；就是把司馬秤一斤，打八一二扣後等於市秤一斤。編者所用的便是這個比率；牠是國府實業部發表的。（見該部於民二十四年出版之中國經濟年鑑A二二〇頁或申報年鑑民二十三年版X六頁）姑名之謂規定率。但此外却還有一個八二七扣，據說這是上海紗布交易所規定，現為巿塲上通用的，牠是把每斤司馬秤打個八二七扣，就當做巿秤一斤。姑名之謂市塲率。查司馬秤原有漕砝，蘇硃等別；其砝子亦分十七兩二錢，十七兩；十六兩八錢；十六兩六錢，十六兩五錢等等；國府厘定市秤為十三兩六錢四分；則規定率似按十六兩八錢之司馬計算，而巿塲率則按十六兩五錢之司馬計算。究以何者為正確？尙待査考。</p>
<p>這兩個不同的折扣，在小額交易上果然不會引起問題，但在大額交易一却就差得很遠。如以美棉一司馬擔言，便要相差二元五角二分八厘。交易額愈大，進出也就愈大，在正當的商業利潤上是「退回不起的」。</p>
<p>顯然的：如以市秤做標準，則規定率下的巿秤份量較輕，巿塲率下的市秤較重。反之，就司馬秤言：規定率下的司馬秤較重，市塲率下的司馬秤較輕。兩率都具有法定性，所以商人可任擇其一而上下其手。</p>
<p>折合率旣不同，結果當然永不「碰頭」。但事實上却又奇怪，如一經英美磅從中轉合，却又「異途同歸」，拍合一致了。如下所舉之例：由美棉折合司馬秤一擔的法幣價有兩個；一個是一百四十元六角三分弱；另一個是只有一百三十八元一角。前者是根據規定率：按每一·三五七六八磅申合司馬秤的；後者是根據市塲率；按每一：三三三……磅申合司馬秤。申合率不同，結果便異，那是當然的。可是若然再從司馬秤價棘合市秤價，那末不論根據規定率而按〇·八一一九折合之；或按市塲率〇·八二六七五而折合之；答數却都是一百十四元一角七分强。</p>
<p>最初，編者認為這是數字上的巧合；所以用另一種行巿加以折合對照，結果仍然相同。如前述的折算，係根據美金一元合法幣十二元〇三分，與美棉每磅價為美金八分六一計算。故假定美金一元合法幣十二元五角與美棉每磅値美金九分，結果司馬秤之每擔法幣價有二個；一個是一百五十二元六三九，一個是一百四十九元九九六，相差二元六二三。但市秤之每擔法幣價，却僅是一百二十四元與一百二十三元九二七六之差，可謂仍然一致的。</p>
<h3 id="c52">過去一週 <a href="#c52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>美匯巳衝到九元三一二五，人心還在望好。很多人且在預測「何時可出十元」？但有人對於英匯只在五便士半左右徘徊，表示駭異。其實他們忘掉在今年七月初英匯剛縮到五便士半的時候，美匯是同比例地縮到十元六八七五；其後對英對美匯率發生跛行縮度，才是應該駭異的。直到歐戰爆發前後，英鎊對美金節節下降時，這種跛行才有理由。目前英鎊對美金雖猶未好轉，但上海黑巿塲上的美匯，顯然還比英匯硬得太兇。所以人心望好，並非沒有根據的。（樂蒂）</p>
<p>財政部日前頒佈外幣定期儲蓄存款辦法，規定中中交農四行及特准之商業銀行辦理。特別提高利息，以資鼓勵。這辦法，一方可使華僑資金回國，一方又可使民閒的外幣集中起來，藉以發展國內經濟建設；並能减少被外滙投機者的操縱，而使外匯暗市愈臻安定。這正是利國利民的兩全辦法。目前姑不論在國家戰時管理通貨制度之下，金銀和外匯都應歸國有。即就持有外幣者本身講，與其把許多外幣存置在保管庫裏，毫不生息，不如將它全數存入銀行，倒可坐收一筆很大的利息；何况國家有無窮盡的寳藏為之保障，總比放入死呆的保管庫裹，要上算千萬倍；何况保管庫在某種情形時不負保管之職的事，現巳有例可舉的了。（一粟）</p>
<p>外匯巳跨出五便士與九元的關，而且還有繼續放長的趨勢。過去為了外匯縮，於是各物飛漲，漲價廣吿，遍登各報。現在外匯放長了，照理一般物價應和外匯同比例地跌價。然而打開報紙，找不到减價廣吿；而各物的售價，仍和三辦士時，不相上下。只有沙利文，冠生園兩家，略有點綴；曾登過實行减價的廣吿。其他就沒有發現甚至有的還在漲，的確因為每家總多少有些存貨，但我們可不能忘却了在劇烈漲價時，各商家也並未為了存貨而平售過。（影）</p>

<p>旣非數字巧合，則為數學之幻術歟？抑巳變為遊戲數學歟？姑置此項原理問題而不論，祇就其在工商業之影響而言關係則不可謂不大！假使你是一位買辦或進貨員，則可以一百四十元六二八或一百五十二元六三六向洋行或老板報賬，而以一百三十八元一角或一百四十九元九九六向賣客付款；同時復各依一百四十元六二八或一百五十二元六三六售與紗廠；則一轉手間，除所得之正常佣金不計外，每担尙可有五六元之特別收入。</p>
<p>顯而易見者；此項錯誤，祇在按司馬秤計算時始發生。苟以巿秤計算，則不論其直接由美棉計算而來，或折威司馬秤而再轉折巿秤，結果皆無二致。以折合必需正確而言，此滋生流弊之司馬秤亟應取消，而一律改用市秤。今日巿塲上堅持習慣而沿用司馬秤計算者，「積習難改」容有若干理由，然亦未始非尙具別種目的歟？</p>
<h3 id="c53">按規定率折合的各種結果 <a href="#c53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>編者所用之折合率，係根據全國度量衡局規定公佈的（見中國經濟年鑑第一回A二二〇頁或申報與年鑑民二十三年版X六頁）。即</p>
<p>一市斤　等於　司馬秤　〇·八一一九斤</p>
<p>等於　英美磅秤　一·一〇二三磅</p>
<p>一司馬斤　等於　市秤　一·二三七斤</p>
<p>等於　英美磅秤　一·三五七六八磅</p>
<p>一英美磅　等於　市秤　〇·九〇七二斤</p>
<p>（註）★係編者按下式算出1．1023÷8119＝1．35768</p>
<p>本刋上期所舉十月二十六日行市。。美棉每磅價為八分六厘一美金，滬美匯率為國幣百元合美金八元三一二五（即美金一元合國幣十二元〇三分）。</p>
<p>如依上列比率計算，不論由美棉直接折合市担；或先合司馬担再轉折市担；或先合市担而轉折司馬担；結果完全一致，所差者至多尾數之幾分或幾毫。試將編者於上期所計算者錄下，復增補以其他之轉折結果，以便相互對照</p>
<p>（A）由美棉直接折合巿秤一担之國幣（參看前昨兩期編者所舉之例）</p>
<p>（B）由A式所得之市担價，轉折為司馬担國幣價（參看前昨兩期編者所舉之例）</p>
<p>（C）由美棉直接折合司馬担之國幣價，或由磅申合，或由磅折合，結果皆與B式所得者同。</p>
<p>此式以磅申合司馬；若以磅按八六一折司馬，結果殆亦一致。尾數之差，則由於所用小數之多少而來。</p>
<p>（D）再由司馬秤價轉折市担之國幣價。其申折兩式之結果當然亦同。</p>
<p>卽每市担合國幣一一四·一七六元；與A式尾數差六厘，原因同上。此係由司馬折合而得。若以巿担申合司馬担，結果當然仍同，僅差尾數而已。</p>
<p>然除上述折合率外，現知巿塲上慣用者，與此有所不同。即</p>
<p>等於　英美磅秤　一·一〇二三磅</p>
<p>一司馬斤　等於　市秤　一·二〇九五八斤</p>
<p>等於　英美磅秤　一·三三三1/3斤</p>
<p>一英美磅　等於　市秤　〇·九〇七斤</p>
<p>上期胡君所計者，卽用此項比率。至於新聞報過去所計者，如與按規定率折合結果不同，又以上列巿塲率折合亦異，則其差異之原因，當在於彼此所用之匯率的不同。因在今日外匯黑市塲上之行情，日必數變；依據之匯率不一致，宜其進出之特鉅。茲復依此種巿塲率。根據同上之行情折合對照如次：</p>
<p>（E）由美棉直接折合司馬担之國幣價（胡君上期舉例時，未計折合率之尾數，故略有進出。匯率係排錯。下係修正數）</p>
<p>此與上列B·D兩式之結果，皆相差二元五角二分八厘。在不同折合率下，此係當然之事。然竟又未必盡然。因由此答數再轉折市秤時，則與上列A·D兩式之折合結果又殆無差異，有如决列下式。</p>
<p>（F）再由E之答數，按巿塲率由司馬〇·八二六七五轉折市担之法幣價，則與A·D兩式之結果相同。</p>
<p>（G）由美棉直接折合市秤一扭之國幣價，因一市秤申合磅秤所用之比率，同為一一〇·二三磅，故與前列A式相同，答數皆一一四·一七三六元；故不復錄。</p>
<p>（H）再用G式答數，按市担申合司馬祖之巿塲率為一二〇·九五八，轉合司馬担之價，則與F式又相同。</p>
<p>不同比率之異同結果</p>
<p>司馬與市秤間之折合率，雖有規定的及市塲的兩種定數；結果理應永不一致，然現經磅秤從中撮合，竟又異途同歸。這就是</p>
<p>（一）根據規定率由美棉直接或間接合成之市秤的國幣價（即A·D兩式），與根據市塲率由美棉直接或間接合成之市秤的國幣價（即F·G兩式），折合率雖不同，結果却相同的。</p>
<p>（二）根據規定率由美棉直接或間接合成之司馬担美棉價（即B·C兩式）皆較由市塲率計算而得者（即E·H兩式）為大。換言之：依巿塲率直接或間接計算而得之司馬秤美棉價，較之以規定率計算而得者為小。</p>
<p>再簡而言之：以司馬秤計量時，因比率不同，故結果互異。如以市秤計量時，比率雖不同，結果却殆無二致。</p>
<p>結果互異者B·D與E·H（即以司馬秤計量時）</p>
<p>結果相同者A·D與F·G（即以市秤計量時）</p>
<p>編者過的是書齋生活，可謂絕無市塲經騐。當張方仁先生提出問題時，只就原理上擬了個量値分別折合的算式，因與新聞報所算者不符，故懷疑自擬之算式或有錯誤，乃就敎於中國棉業公司經理聶光地先生。聶先生為國內有數之棉業專家，審定算式無誤，惟謂「非市塲上所習用」。承介紹胡君為文答復。胡君曾任中棉職務。現供職某洋行，內行人談內行話，當然萬無一失。祗以單位用司馬秤，故戲而轉折市秤，初不料彼此間對於巿秤及司馬秤之折合率不同。及再訪光地先生，各用不同折合率之眞相乃大白。同時復蒙恒源泰張方仁，瀛洲染織吳復三，韋性記韋耀達，盛和花號趙瑾，誠信昌綘水，以及徐季杰，毛振麟等十餘位先生來函供給答案及各種參攷材料；或用規定率，或用巿塲率，頗不一致；於是驟感有進一步研究之興趣。並以為今後不如改用市秤較為穩當。本文之作，一方以叙述此决問題發生之經過，並向共同硏究之各位先生略伸謝意；他方亦具拋磚引玉之意焉。</p>

<p>— 俄國勞動大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>男子身體之所以虧損虛弱，由於荒淫者雖佔多數，然因過度操勞，或因先天不足及後天營養不良，致新陳代謝力減低者，亦為最大原因之一。</p>
<p>至於女性多萎黃貧血，早衰腎虧的原因，大部分都因家務過繁，或生育過頻所促成。</p>
<p>吾人體力旣吿虧損之後，第一就是容易感覺疲勞，其原因由於體內生活力減低，細胞因而死亡。蓋一方面如過度勞作，其細胞之死亡也愈多，因勞作與細胞之死亡成正比例，勞作愈多，細胞之屍體愈見堆積，這種細胞的屍體，就是促進疲勞的唯一原因。</p>
<p>睡眠雖說是一個絕好的復健機會，但體虧必患神經衰弱，往往失眠，何况受生活壓迫的人，其腦力不停地在運用，要做到能够節省其腦力，未始不是一種攝生的方法，且生於現代繁複的社會，男的謀生不遑，而女的大都躬主家政，受子女所累者殊多，所以要增進健康，確是不易的事。故唯一的辦法，在攝取動植礦物中有益於人體的成分，以增精補血，促進新陳代謝之機能，因此選擇補劑，遂成為一重要的問題。况市上補劑品類繁多，欲合乎科學化及吾輩醫師之理想者殊少。於是醫家病家莫不苦之，然依余多年來之經騐所知的問題。况市上補劑品類繁多，最近備為各國學者所稱道之德國「補體康」一藥，係採自雄壯動物之舉丸與卵巢內分泌素，並攝入補腦之燐質及其他人身不可缺少的營養要素而製成，故補力達於萬能，不僅能使血液充盈，頭腦淸爽，體重增進，而且對於治療因自凟斵傷，荒淫致病者，能發揮百分之百的療效，允其患早洩，陰痿，腎虧不育者見效允速。年老人服之，能使精神一爽，食慾增進。其女用「補體康」能治月經不調，貧血早衰等症。至於男子遺精頻繁，則除服「補體康」之外，應兼以「耐而斯遺精片」服之卽止。</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>宋時岳武穆有句很雄壯的豪語，就是「直搗黃龍」，黃龍是金國的根據地，將他消滅，才是根本的辦法，可惜功敗垂成。千古惋惜；這是表明凡是要成功，必須根本解決以淋病而言，淋病患者往往以病患暫時隱伏，遂毫不去注意牠，一切行動，與未患病時無異；而結果所屆，時發時愈，病勢愈來愈壞，而至不可收拾故善治淋病者，必善治其根，而淋病之根又必須剷除，凡是再復之病，必其病根未除，而淋病之一再復發者，允其如此。故余以為要求淋病表面上一時隱伏，並非難事。而所難者，在於如何可以直搗病菌巢穴耳。幸而現在科學有高速度之發展，對於此等難題確獲安全之解決。原來德國淋病學大師彼德博士，以三十餘年之經騐，發明採用蛋白體黃色素混合製劑「克淋儂」，此劑歷年來經世界各大著名醫師實騐證明其有實效。效力超過一切平凡的化學療法，因此劑旣參用非特異性療法之原理，繼續改良而成功者。其效力能於服後數小時內，發生抗淋噬菌作用，不論初起時的淋病，和慢性淋的淋病，皆可迅速根治。這因為淋菌繁殖力雖繁，逃竄的地方雖多，終是敵不過「克淋儂」效力，能直接扑滅淋菌巢穴，宛如天羅地網，決難倖逃漏網的。所以一經「克淋儂」治愈的淋病，從無再發之事，更無失敗之例。至於外用藥方面，男子可外用「抗淋水」按圖與說明書自行洗滌尿道，女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，每晚於臨睡挿入一片，决晨洗去即得，則其功效，允為完備迅速。</p>

<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>咳嗽之症，最易使人輕忽，原因是咳嗽患者，以其一時並無若何危篤之現象可怕，所以一直就延宕下來，而咳嗽也就愈演愈凶，馴致不可挽救。</p>
<p>從眞正的病理上而言，咳嗽乃肺部排除外界侵入不良份子，正是一種抵抗禦侮的表示，若是用麻醉劑反而减低抵抗力，以余二十餘年之經騐，並參考各國醫家實騐報錄，惟德國徒梅博士所發明之肺病特效藥「補肺拿爾」一藥功效最著，不論如何頑固難愈，或將成癆之咳嗽，服「補肺拿爾」後能於三小時內，收鎭咳化痰之功，補肺防癆，其功遠居魚肝油之上，此為各國醫家所證明者</p>

<p>— 周</p>
<p>馬相伯氏病逝諒山之訊到滬，各界咸極震悼。馬氏興學立言，功在國家，門牆桃李，遍於海內，爰將先生生平事跡，略加叙述，當舉國痛失老成典型之日，亦可作為靑年楷模之資。</p>
<p>馬氏名良，字相伯，生於一八三九年江蘇之丹陽縣。世奉天主敎，父松巖公以布衣授徒，母沈太夫人。民國紀元前六十五年，先生九歲，入私塾。十一歲畢讀五經。十叫歲肄業徐匯公學，時太平軍興，先生赴蘇州太倉等處求濟難民。二十歲羅馬敎廷授職為司鐸，二十四歲，譯著數理大全。三十一歲宣敎徐州，三十三歲遭父喪。三十六歲，入合肥李文忠幕。四十三歲淸廷派先生赴美，擬借款五千萬，籌自造軍械，因權貴昏瞶未果。四十五歲奉命赴朝鮮，四十七歲赴法考察商務。五十三歲任駐長崎領事。五十六歲遭母喪。六十四歲斥資創震旦大學，馬君武，張軼歐，邵力子均出其門。時于右任作詩譏時政，被淸廷狗捕，避來海上，先生招之入院。六十六歲為復旦公學樹立經費基碮。六十七歲奉命赴東京辦理留學生事宜。七十歲長筏旦公學。七十三歲民國肇建，先生留南京。七十一歲任北大校長，兼參政院參政，參議院參議。帝制議起，先生上書袁氏力爭，卒辭職南下。七十四歲，著新史合論直講。七十八歲移寓上海徐家滙土山灣。七十九歲，著國民照心鏡。八十七歲，先生著致知淺說第一卷原言篇，由商務出版。八十八歲著靈心小史。九十歲時，國府定都南京，先生續著致知淺說，復譯四聖福音。九十五歲著徐文定公與中國科學。九十六歲，著童鮑斯高聖傳。</p>
<p>二十三年十二月，馮玉祥氏在泰安時，曾由絲織廠繡製馬半身像多幀，馮親題「國之大老」四字，並分函各界，謂九一八以還，先生慟河山之破碎，居常涕淚縱橫，悲歌慷慨，爰製繡像，以誌景仰，並將馬像分送友好。是年十二月十二日，先生九十七歲時，應中央之邀，乘專車赴南京，庽鼓樓大方巷十二號。讀漢書及三國志，同時國府明令以馬捐資數十萬，創設上海震旦大學，特予褒獎。十四日中央三十三决常會，選任馬氏為國府委員。二十六年八月十二日，馬氏應中央廣播電台之請，講演「鋼鐵政策，」謂國家要先富後强，是不容易，孔子說足食足兵，是富强並重，請大家快起來鍊鋼鍊鐵，常强中國云云。是年秋，中日軍興，馬於戰事爆發前，即電其手創之大和醫院，設立傷兵醫院，嗣即於十一月初離京至漢口。二十六日由衡陽抵全州，轉赴桂林疊綵山。馬之庽處，則為常熟瞿忠宜江陵張忠烈兩公成仁處。嗣該地空襲甚頻，移庽諒山。二十八年三月，馬氏百齡大慶，全國各地舉行盛大慶祝。國府於四月五日明令，謂壽登百齡，襟情豪邁，無减常年，匪惟民族之英，抑亦國家之瑞，載頒明令，特予褒獎。四月十一日，新聞記者訪馬於諒山，馬慨乎言之，「我是一隻狗，只會呌，呌了一百年，還沒有把中國呌醒。」是年馬遍函海內，中謝祝壽，謂諸君能體念微意，使老人目睹中興，舉世同登壽域，則老人百年生亦不虛矣。同時，中委各要人公啟為氏百齡慶典，醵金救護傷兵。</p>
<p>先生學術深湛，著述等身，惟至晚年八句以外，猶孜孜學習書畫，好學精神，老而彌篤。當老人九十七歲時，舊雨宴氏於某酒樓，半附，有一羹進，後悉需三百金，馬氏聞之，食小下嚥。事後，馬對人道及此事，輒為悻悻！當馬氏應國府邀入京時，當局為其特備籐椅，在站迎接，此則除中委張人傑氏不良於行外，在站以籐椅恭迎者，猶屬特見。氏在京時，晨五時牛即起床，九時早餐，下午沐浴，生活規律，至為嚴格，其每日糧食，計鷄蛋五個，鷄汁一盅為中要食品。</p>

<p>儌倖得很的得到了知友王君的電話：</p>
<p>「我們公司裹（電話公司）要招幾個練習生，將來的出路是相當好，訓練三年後，就是副工程師。」</p>
<p>這使我興奮極了，趕忙跑去，經過他的介紹後，我立刻就去同一個外國工程師作第一决的口試。經過了一决短短的談話，他答應我參加這决的考試，並且要我將履歷表塡一下，當然是完全用英文的。</p>
<p>「這决應考的共八十多個，錄取祇不過五個。」當天—考試的那天，王君道樣地吿訴我：「並且外界又沒有知道，除了幾隻工部局中學的畢業生—由他們學校裹選一部份出來的—否則裏面一定有熟人的，考時當心一些，不要慌！」謝謝他這樣地可囑我。然而一共八十多個，我眞有些慌了，假使公開招考，那末我想至少要增加幾十倍吧？</p>
<p>口試是關於普通常識的問答，他問你「跑馬廳與外白渡橋在何處？」還給了十多種不同的顏色，呌你分門別類的說出這顏色的英文名字來。他還呌你數一個有很多針孔的東西，要你數明白到底這東西有多少針。這些是在一個中國工程師那裹考的。外國工程師的口試，是許多試騐你「小聰明」的題目。那祇要鎭靜，一定能够答對的。例如：「三加六除三乘五减六乘三的結果」，「一只大匣子包含三只小匣，這三只小匣子又每隻包含四隻更小的匣子，那末共有幾隻匣子？」不過這些問題，你要答得快。末後他呌你打一决電話，大的是關於報吿時間的。記着！用左手拿起聽筒，聽到表軌聲後，才用右手撥號碼，就道樣把一半的應考者淘汰了。</p>
<p>複試時祇賸我們四十二人了。</p>
<p>複試又分筆試，口試和「實習」。筆試時，國英算的題目還容易，不過考題都要用英文解答，就是作文題目，也是用着「英文」。假使你平時對於工部局的吿示是常常注意的話，那是都很容易交卷的，像這决的英文考題中的「中文翻英文」一段，就是「安全第一」中的一節。</p>
<p>最後是「實習」，譬如將鉛綫做成一只「電話機」和一個「六角屋」。再經過一次口試就完畢了，這次的口試是比上决容易得多了，例如他給你十多種的東西看，要你在五分鐘內寫出名字來，再給你很多種類的東西，呌你分門別類的分開來，還有他給二家公館的名字和地址，要你找出他們的電話號碼。（郭英）</p>

<h3 id="c92">學校服用國貨運動 <a href="#c92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>最近上海的舉校，開始作服國貨運動，而像輔仁和震旦等校，已首先倡導。要是各學校能够贊助，這個運動是會擴大的，而在此時此地實行服用國貨，是不無相當的煮義。但日後的能吾成功，這有待於各學校的能够信守與實行。</p>
<p>在學校裏，不問是敎師，是學生，全是知識階級，優秀份子。提倡國貨能吾成效，也就在看敎育界的能吾實行服用國貨。過往提倡國貨運動，差不多每年要舉行幾决，這高調我們也好像聽慣了，然而歷來　倡國貨，服用國貨等各種運動，結果如何，嚴格的說來，成效等於零。</p>
<p>屢次的發起提倡國貨運動，而結果，獲得的却失敗，這癥結就在知識階中級不能首先實行，嘴上儘管說提倡國貨是救國的最好辦法，但祇要身上有錢，買東西還是洋貨好。單就學校方面說，無論在書本上，在敎師的口頭上，時常要討論到服用國貨問題，是中國垂危聲中急不待緩的事情。然而不拘是敎師或學生，身上却十九穿西裝，或外國衣料。祇是口頭講，不能去實行，能够收效嗎？</p>
<p>在歐戰發生以後，舶來品的售價奇昂，我們冉要去購買不必要的洋貨，在自己是作下意識的消費，在國家是减弱抗戰的力量。所以無論在時間或空間上，知識階級都應首先實行服用國貨起來。使我們可以看到上海若干學校，在這時候倡導服用國貨運動，是特別的有意義哩！</p>
<p>不過我們爲歷來提倡國貨運動的屢作屢敗，不能不嚴肅的來一决自我檢討。嘴巴上在講服用國貨，每一個敎師，每一個學生，大家檢討一下，是吾已實行服用國貨，否則空口說白話，等於不去倡導，結果是失敗，成效是零點。我們相信如果學校方面能够眞正實行服用國貨，一定可把此風迅速的推廣到各個階級層，結果可使在歐戰聲中的中國國貨廠商，獲得一大好的時機，而無限量的發展起來，這更可有助於國家抗戰的實力。所以筆者要希望今回發起的學校服用國貨運動，不但耍力使迅速推廣，更要能够實行，勿蹈以前的覆轍，才能收效，否則還是開一響空砲而已。</p>

<p>第十七回　習外勤報人新領域　服內務學舍小排塲</p>
<p>當新聞記者的人，雖然不是什麼全知全能的上帝，但是應該什麼都要知道一點，就是他的常識越豐富越好了。不過常識沒有止境，而且隨時代而進展，要怎樣纔能使他的常識豐富呢？這惟有求學是一個正當的途徑了。原來這位邵慧華小姐的父親，他也是新聞界裏的人。他見自己這位掌上明珠，對於新聞有天才。從少女時代，便嶄然露了頭角，可以克紹他的箕裘。他自然願意把她培養成一位最優秀出衆的女新聞記者，爲了使她常識豐富起見，送她到美國著名的大學，去研究新聞學。但是僅僅學點什麼課堂裏的新聞學，書本上的新聞學，有什麼用呢？所以還是注重於本國的一切。本國的歷史，本國的地理，本國的風土人情，本國的政治社會。那邵慧華的父親，當中日戰爭的時候，他曾當了好幾年的戰地記者，在槍林彈雨，砲火機雲之下，吃過了許多辛苦，他也是個經騐充足的老記者了。現在他的小姐出來當記者，幸虧這戰事已經平定了。不然，他想一位年靑的姑娘，來當戰地記者。她們雖然巾幗英豪，有此膽略，不怕什麼，但父親是過來人，談虎色變，不免終覺的有些不放心吧？邵慧華小姐本來是位絕頂聰明的女孩子，幾年功夫，在國外留學，在國內歷練，當然常識是極爲豐富了。於常識之外，便是潛心致力於各種技術。就是上文所說的，開汽車，駕飛機，划船，騎馬，爬山，跑冰，游泳，打球，以及其他一切，她是學一樣，會一樣，不但件件皆能，而且件件皆精了。有了天才，有了修養，我們就要說到第三件的興味了。倘然她一時雖然很致力於此，而不久便厭棄了，這個興味便不够，不足以支持這許久。惟其對於這事感到了興趣，無論怎樣地吃辛吃苦，都願　盡力去做，那纔算是完備。看了邵慧華小姐各種技術上的事，都能學會，這就可見她對於各種技術，都有興味。以前是如此，以後也是如此。以天才，修養，興味，三件主要的事，集合起來，成功這樣一位優秀完全的新聞記者，而且還是一位靑年女郞，這不是難能可貴的嗎？（一九九）</p>

<p>— 冬耳</p>
<p>上海的「弄堂小學」本來是多得不可計數，淪陷以後，更顯得觸目皆是。其中艱苦奮鬥，以敎育兒童爲重任的果然不能一筆抹煞，但是大多數的「弄堂小學」已完全變成了商業化的「學店」。因爲房租昂貴，一切設備，因陋就簡，自屬情有可宥，可是乘着這千載斯逢的機會，不學無術之徒，也租了一幢房子，掛上一塊銅牌，辦起學校來了。他們簡直根本不懂得什麼是「敎育」，祇要學生塞滿課堂，學費收足，就是一筆好賣買。譬如我住的弄堂裹的一隻小學，學生收得太多，連一點光綫都沒有的後樓都做了課室，還是容納不下，於是每一點鐘終有一班學生在弄堂里上「體操課」，而美其名曰「注重體育」。由此可以知道，「孤島」上的弄堂小學，確是以敎育兒童爲重任的，實屬鳳毛麟角了。</p>
<p>昨天的報上，我們又讀到了這樣一段新聞：法租界西自來火街一百八十一號時輪小學，係沿馬路單幢三層樓房屋，有學生的七十餘人。昨爲星期六，放學後學生仍至校內遊戲。晚七時四十分，學生二十餘人，正在二層樓上跳躍爲戲，樓擱柵忽然中斷，樓板頓時坍下，全體學生皆隨之下墜，跌作一團，哭喊不巳。自來火街一段，攤販擁塞，終日呌囂，這所在是吾適宜於「讀書」，已是一個問題；現在更不幸而發生這樣的悲劇，可見辦學者對於學校的一切設施很少注意到，敎育自然更談不到了。這些學生精神上所受的損失已很大，現在冉要受肉體上的痛苦，眞是令人痛心的事。即此一端，這些不健全的「弄堂小學」確有調查而加以取締的必要。關於這件「坍樓案」，捕房正在調查內幕原因，不過坍樓是事實，做校長應負全責，無論如何是不能逃避的。</p>

<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>十月三十一日美聯社紐的電云：中國平民救濟聯合會，為募集每年經費，宜布十一月七日至八日，在紐的唐人街舉行『開放節』兩日，十一月九日，在彼爾旅館舉行「一碗飯』運動，……聯合會主席，羅斯福上校（前任羅斯福總統公子）聲稱，『我人不能希望救濟中國所有難民六千萬人，但我人能以開放節及一碗飯運動收入所得，拯救多數生命，並减少難民之痛苦』云云。</p>
<p>我們看了這一則電訊，心裏眞有無限的隱痛。擺在眼前的孤島上是：言論不自由，行動不自由，有話不能說，有家歸不得。要想開放你的行動和自由，談何容易。重洋萬里的唐人街舉行「開放節」那衣，食，住，行，的物品展覽，顯示出中華立國數千年來的文化，必有熱烈絢爛的展開。接着，是美人為我們難胞，舉行「一碗飯」運動，善「胞與為懷」的功德，我們陷於水深火熱中的難胞，眞要感覺得淪肌浹髓了！</p>
<p>筆者目擊孤島上的人，有的是朝朝魚肉，夜夜蝦蟹，吃得腦滿腸肥。有的是：蘿蔔，靑菜，或者是辣花，豆榨相佐的一碗「黃米飯」。有的竟是求一飯而不可得。同屬國難期中的同胞，而享受的懸殊有如此者！</p>

<p>— 宴然</p>
<p>是深秋了，天氣一天天的寒冷起來，眞使人們感覺到添置塞衣，這正是一個適當的時節。</p>
<p>生活富裕而養尊處優的人們，對於這個添置塞衣的問題，眞是不成其為問題的。有了錢，什麽都有了。最可憐的，要算一般為了戰爭而流浪在「孤島」上的難胞們，他們眼看著天氣一天天的寒冷起來，而自己身上的「寒衣」，還不知道在什麼地方呢</p>
<p>據本巿難民救濟協會的報吿，最近流浪在孤島上的難胞，總共還有三萬餘人之多。這許多難胞們，目前正在急切的憂慮着的，便是這個嚴重的微衣間題。</p>
<p>為了這，筆者十二萬分的盼望孤島上一般生活優裕的人們，大家來推廣「己寒人寒」之心，同情於難胞們流離顚沛的悲哀，而予以相當的救濟。舉凡家中所有破舊而不穿的大小衣服，該酌量情形，送一部份到難民救濟協會去，請協會分發給男女難胞，沒有舊衣的，希望能够稍稍節省一些生活上無謂的浪費，例如少跳幾隻舞，少吃幾客大菜，少　幾决麻將，少坐幾回汽車，……便可把這些金錢，來移作難胞們添置寒衣之需了。這種功德，眞是勝造「七級浮屠」的。</p>
<p>唉！天寒矣，事急矣，願孤島上一般生活在水平綫上的人們，大家來注意這個難胞寒衣問題吧。</p>

<p>— 夏晨</p>
<p>時序已轉到了深秋，不久嚴寒的冬委又將光臨，在這寒冷的季節裹，經騐和習慣吿訴我們是淮補最適宜的時令；筆者願意介紹一種價格低廉，而富有滋補效能的補品給大衆——那不用說就是豆乳了。</p>
<p>豆乳通常稱為豆漿，在我國是一種通俗的食品，一般人以為這種以極普通極低賤的豆子所磨出來的汁漿，不會有多大滋補的效能。其實是謬誤的。我們祇要看德國的生物學家以及營養化學專家Koenig氏的對於黃豆成分的統計，就可明瞭它的價値，他的統計如下；蛋白質百分之二五脂肪百分之六，碳水化物百分之五六水分百分之十三其他更含有豐富的維他命B，以及多種有益人體的礦物質。</p>
<p>這樣說來，豆子對於人體有着絕佳的滋養分，那末磨成了豆乳後，因為易於消化的緣故，當然更有宏大的滋補效能了。</p>
<p>不過市上通常所售的豆乳，不是用豆窳劣，便是磨製不衛生，而且滋味大都很壞；所以我們如要飲用，最好是自己磨製，磨製的手續如下：先將豆子在淸水中浸五六小時，然後將它磨成漿汁，磨完後再將漿汁用布袋過濾而濾去其渣滓，最後將它煮沸，攙入少許白糖或醬油味精等後便可飲用。</p>
<p>話雖是這樣說，但是實際上呢？我們小市民大多數是為着生活在整天地忙着的，那裏有許多空閒的時間來幹這些事情呢？所以我希望市上有一種合乎我理想的豆乳出現，但定價不能太高，那末我們便可經濟便利地購飲。在今年萬物飛漲聲中，我想也是大多數人們所渴望着的吧！</p>
<h3 id="c98">勃爾宅後的「籬笆」 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>— 方久操</p>
<p>——重整道德會英國代表——</p>
<p>勃爾，這名字聽來似乎非常生疏，沒有像史太林，張伯倫那樣的響亮，可是在英倫三島，沒有一個人不知道他的大名。當時有許多人對他表同情，也有許多人聽得了他的名字感覺頭痛。但到現在，差不多每個人都對他表示好感了！</p>
<p>勃爾的出身，是倫敦某工廠裏的勞工，他曾經領導了工人們，起來反抗資本家殘酷的壓迫，但也正因此故，失掉了他的職務。他失業後，更糾集了許多勞工，——最多時達數千人，——向資本家的建築物作洩憤式的破壞，他認為經營商業的資本家，都是勞工們心目中的仇敵，不論這商店的本身，有沒有和他們發生過任何關係，所以好許多商店，都蒙了無辜的損失。他們常常利用黑夜，擊毀各商店的大玻璃，每决出動，至少有數百家商店遭遇不幸，因此倫敦的商人們聽到了勃爾的名字，準會皺眉搖首。</p>
<p>在某一個時期裏，大家巳認為勃爾是一個不可救藥的無賴了，人人都避之若凂，沒有一個敢和他接近，他屋後的鄰居，為防止勃爾的侵擾，特地在宅境四週，圍築了一條堅固的籬笆。</p>
<p>最後，他—勃爾—經　了一般的朋友們熱誠的勸吿，和飽受了不少非金錢所能買到的寳貴敎訓後，覺得自己的行為，委實非常錯誤，於是痛改前非，着意向善，不到幾個月，先後已判若兩人了。</p>
<p>這消息傳到了人們的耳裏，都以為是一椿新奇的事情，對勃爾的突然間轉變態度，表示無限驚異。勃爾的許多朋友，也漸漸地和他恢復了交誼，他屋後的鄰居，更自動把籬笆拆除了。並且過來和勃爾握手道故，歡洽備至。</p>
<p>這决勃爾代表祖國，到茉洲出席重整道德大會，在會塲中，他把這件「籬笆」的故事，來吿訴聽衆，並且說：『人與人之間，更不知有多少無形的「籬笆」，希望大家用「至誠」「純潔」「無私」「博愛」四個標準，來把它們拆除。』</p>

<p>— 王一之自荷蘭寄</p>
<p>中國肴饌之美甲天下，其最可貴之珍品，為今西餐所不得有者，却非肥雞大肉，而為平民化之豆腐；至如江西南昌所產『水豆腐』，允為走遍天涯不易復享之無上口福。我國古說取以喩孝道之吸菽飲水，若為聯綴其詞曰『水菽』，殆即南昌『水豆腐』天造地設之別稱。本年六月二十六日之晨，昭實以上海寄來之胡府合堂映相，欣然見示，即題兩絕句，奉答胡志翔兄麟起，兼呈蓮丈。回憶三十年舊事，乃即以水菽入詩，句云：</p>
<p>檢點征杉刧後灰，靈機初逐笑顏開，眼前人物如相遇，門巷淸陰驛使來。（紀夢）</p>
<p>彭澤歸來意自寬，大庭喬木蔭芝蘭，舉頭三十年前事，水菽琳腴一報靴。（寫實）</p>
<p>按水豆腐之原料為黃豆，又名大豆，英文曰「菽Soy」，西歐通稱曰「菽也Soja」，（韋氏大字典引據日本文，，稱菽也為醬油二字之變音，未免失之附會），而臘丁文之植物學名，則稱之為粗毛甜根（Glycian　hispida）謂與甜根之植物為同類，黃豆之可貴，為能兼備衣食住行四者之用。</p>
<p>請先言食，黃豆所含「甜根質Glycinin」，音意兼譯，當為甘株質，實為化學成分最充足之蛋白質，包括吾人生活所必需之各種「淡輕二組有機酸」，（德文作Aminosaure），用為食品時，功用之大，竟與牛肉及獸肉之動物類蛋白質，不相上下，非若其他植物類蛋白質所含淡一輕二有機酸之偏缺不全。且自脂肪之比率言，黃豆粉之勝過其他粉者十倍，黃豆粒之勝過其他豆粒者，可三十倍。又自蛋白質之比率言，黃豆粉比他豆加一倍，為二與一之比，而黃豆粒之勝過他豆，則為十五與一之比。是吾人多食豆腐，旣可省去無數枚之雞蛋，而豆腐之養生保健，並不亞於新鮮牛乳。西方社會不諳製豆腐，一朝茹素，常不免與臣朔飢死之憂。從來茹素戒殺生，幾將為我華人獨享之福，凡我愁窮處困之同胞，苟因念及旅腐海外者不易享豆腐琳腴，共起而獎進豆食，自可於米昂肉貴之秋，求得意想不到之解慰矣。</p>
<p>其次言衣，黃豆所含甜根質之大有利於工業製造，無異牛乳中所可提取之結乳質（Casein），東亞人飲牛乳者甚少，而飲豆腐漿者特多。若我國之工業家，知仿德國人製造牛乳羊毛之新法，提取甜根質，即進而成人造羊毛絲（Lanital），自將於彼英國人之豆油工業以外，別呈異彩。</p>
<p>至若黃豆工業之可大有裨於住與行，則請師法太平洋對岸之友邦，聞今美國福德（Ford）氏汽車工廠，巳知利用黃豆中之甜根質，得無水蟻酸之助，施以緊壓，產出堅逾鐵而輕似木之人造樹脂，此即上海工業界之所謂『膠木』，可以用作汽車窗框門把或開車之撥桿，又可以為阻電之器材。此黃豆之利於行者。他如製造紙張肥皂油漆油氈油布印刷用顏色，及家用小器件等等，莫不可從黃豆之中得原料，則黃豆之利於住者。中國人獎逃豆食之利益，舉一例萬，不可勝述也。國人因利乘便，將何樂而不為乎？</p>

<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese authorities, Japanese planes attacked Chengdu twice in 24 hours, with 54 planes attacking yesterday and 30 today. They were intercepted by Chinese fighter planes. During the battle in the skies north of Chengdu yesterday, several Japanese bombers were shot down, and the wreckage of two has been found. Another message from Chengdu says two wrecks were found in Renshou and one in Shehong. Although lookouts in various parts of Sichuan reported Japanese plane activity from time to time yesterday, no alarm was sounded in Chengdu. After dropping bombs in the suburbs, the Japanese planes hastily fled south due to the pursuit of the Chinese planes, then turned northeast to return to their base in Shanxi Province. Yesterday, seventeen Japanese planes also departed from eastern Hubei to bomb Kuixian in eastern Sichuan before returning. At 9:30 AM this morning, the first alarm sounded in Chengdu, followed by an emergency alarm around 10:45 AM. Fifteen minutes later, Japanese planes appeared in the high skies above Chengdu and were immediately engaged by Chinese fighter planes. The Japanese planes retreated south. The alarm was lifted at 12:15 PM. Today's Japanese planes came from the north and dropped only a few bombs, causing minimal damage. The first few bombs fell near the North Airfield, killing and injuring several people. A few bombs also fell on the South Airfield. Yesterday afternoon, eighteen Japanese planes attacked Liuzhou, and several others conducted reconnaissance in southern Jiangxi, bombing Guangchang and Jishui before flying back to their base in northern Jiangxi. (5th, Reuters)</p>
<p>Chengdu: When Japanese planes attacked Chengdu on the 4th, a Chinese anti-aircraft gun hit a Japanese plane, which crashed in the countryside of Renshou. Two Japanese planes shot down by the Chinese Air Force have now been found, one crashing in Guanyin Temple in Renshou and the other in the countryside of Zhongjiang County. The latter was the Japanese leader's plane. The fuselage was completely destroyed, with only four machine guns and several pistols remaining. The seven Japanese air officers and soldiers on board were also burned to death.

<p>Chongqing: Yesterday, it was broadcast that the 26th Army Group would be entering Yunnan, and that the Central Government would be making certain arrangements for the province. A reporter made a special visit to a certain important government official to inquire about the matter. According to the official, the broadcast was entirely Japanese propaganda and had no basis in fact. The Japanese have recently launched a large-scale "rumor offensive," hoping to confuse international audiences and undermine Chinese unity through false propaganda. Therefore, a few days ago, they fabricated rumors that the Kuomintang and the Communist Party were about to split, and that Mr. Shao Lizi had gone to Yan'an, deliberately creating lies that the Central Government would split from Yunnan. However, everyone knows that Yunnan Chairman Long is loyal and patriotic, and firm in his resistance to Japan, as evidenced by his actions. As for the 26th Army Group, it is fighting on the front lines, so there is no question of it being transferred to Yunnan. What the Japanese say is nothing more than seeing ghosts in broad daylight. People in China and abroad will certainly not believe this kind of baseless rumor-mongering, and it will only show their futile efforts. (5th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e11">Even if the Yangtze River is Opened, Britain's Profits Will Be Very Limited; If You Want to Obtain Chinese Material Supply, You Should Strengthen Aid to China; Arguments in "Sweep the Bandits" Newspaper <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: Sir Eric Phillips, chairman of the British Chamber of Commerce in the British Empire, wrote to the London Times in mid-October, arguing that the British government should quickly negotiate with Japan to open the Yangtze River so that Britain could obtain material supplies from China. Tan Jiaxi (transliteration), a prominent Chinese industrialist and representative of the National Resources Commission's Coastal Defense Office, refuted this in an article in the "Sweep the Bandits" newspaper. According to Tan, opening the Yangtze River will not allow Britain to obtain a large supply of materials from China as it did during the last war. Although the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are currently controlled by the Japanese, large areas on both sides of the Yangtze River are still under the control of the Chinese government. Therefore, even if it is opened, the materials that can be obtained are very limited. Furthermore, since the Japanese blockaded the Yangtze River, the Chinese government has attempted to trade with Britain and France through Yangon and Haiphong, but to date, due to the lack of continued supply of railway materials from Britain, the滇缅 railway has not yet been completed. If the British side can pay attention to this, then China's material needs for Britain and France can be fully supplied, so there is no need to rush to seek the opening of the Yangtze River. In short, Phillips' argument clearly lacks a real understanding of the situation in the Far East. If Phillips could learn the true facts, he would certainly not make such an argument. Tan concluded that for the common interests of Britain and China, the British government should strengthen its aid to China and thereby seek to obtain Chinese material supplies.

From today onwards, cinemas in major cities in mainland China, such as Chongqing, Xi'an, Nanning, Lanzhou, Tianshui, Guiyang, Kunming, Nanzheng, Chengdu, Guilin, Wuzhou, and Wanxian, will show Soviet films to celebrate. All films are supplied by the China Asia Film Company, the exclusive distributor of Soviet films in China. The China-Soviet Cultural Association will also hold a special celebration at a theater in Chongqing on the evening of November 6th, with a wonderful program planned. Soviet expatriates in Chongqing will all participate. (5th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: November 7th is the 22nd anniversary of the Soviet Revolution. The Soviet Embassy here will hold a tea party to entertain people from all walks of life in China. The China-Soviet Cultural Association will also hold a mass rally to celebrate. In addition, the Soviet "Asian Film Bureau" will supply dozens of reels of Soviet sound films for screening in the eleven major cities under the control of the Chinese government. Five cinemas in Chongqing and four cinemas in Chengdu have begun showing Soviet films today. Although Hollywood films are more entertaining, they are rarely seen here. As for Soviet films, they are widely distributed because the Soviet "Asian Film Bureau" has distribution offices in these and other cities. Chinese youth who are directly or indirectly involved in war work and public service, although they do not understand Russian, all yearn for Soviet films. However, those who are interested in Soviet films are mostly young people, and they are not as suitable for men and women, old and young as American films. (5th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Japan's Latest Failure <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>"Facts are the most eloquent." All propaganda benefits from facts as the best source material, all arguments benefit from facts as the strongest evidence, all credit relies on facts as the most reliable guarantee, and truth, falsehood, right, wrong, benefit, harm, gain, and loss rely on facts as the most relevant and final judgment. Therefore, the cunning are eager to create facts that benefit themselves, and if they fail to create them, they pretend they are facts. If facts are not conducive to themselves, they conceal and distort the facts. Therefore, false exaggerations often become obstacles to sight and hearing, and those who are ruled by emotion lose their intelligence and fall into these obstacles. It is essential to clearly examine the facts in matters concerning one's personal life and conduct, let alone in planning for the country.</p>
<p>Japan is truly mired in a state of helplessness regarding the Sino-Japanese problem. It has devoted all its strength to military offensives, diplomatic offensives, and political offensives, sometimes even advancing on all three fronts simultaneously. Now, it has entered the stage of failure on all three fronts. In terms of military offensives: all wars must end in peace, but those who initiate wars are not aimed at seeking peace but at striving for victory; Japan's invasion of China is not aimed at making peace with China but at defeating China. This cannot be concealed by sophistry. Having fought hard for more than two years, Japan is not incapable of launching several more decisive offensives, nor is it certain that it cannot occupy several more towns and cities. However, Japan must defeat the main force of the Chinese army, rendering China unable to resist, and force China to accept a treaty of surrender before it can complete its invasion and victory. Those who doubt China's ability to achieve final victory, let us not make any explanations for now. However, the fact that Japan is absolutely unable to complete its victory militarily can be proven by various current facts. Therefore, in terms of military offensives, Japan has indeed already failed; and the fact that awaits future proof is the ultimate failure of Japan's aggression.</p>
<p>In terms of diplomatic offensives: Japan has no regard for other countries in the Sino-Japanese problem, believing that it can solely dominate the Far East. Therefore, for the past seven or eight years, Japan's only active work in the international arena has been to correspond and cooperate with Germany; beyond this, it has arbitrarily insulted the weaker and acted hypocritically towards the stronger. The strong protests made successively by the United States, Britain, and France at the end of last year and the beginning of this year, which Japan ignored, can serve as clear evidence. Until recently, as the signs of military offensive failure gradually became apparent, Japan, instead of reflecting on itself, shifted its anger to the assistance provided to China by various countries. It then changed its attitude of disregard and launched a diplomatic offensive with a ferocious face. The Gulangyu Incident and the Tianjin Incident were both examples of this approach; the results of these attempts only exposed its ferocity. By late July, when the United States announced the termination of the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty, Japan gradually realized that the various countries would not abandon the Far East and sit idly by while witnessing aggression. It gradually realized that international pressure was increasing daily, and that its past hypocritical propaganda had not been accepted by the various countries. It then sought other opportunities, using the strengthening of anti-communism as a tool for diplomatic counter-offensive. However, it was suddenly abandoned by Germany. The Nomura diplomacy of the Abe cabinet was based on this. But what do the facts seem to be? Despite acting as if it were feigning indifference, repeatedly stating that it did not intend to negotiate with Britain and the United States for the time being, negotiations continued as usual. It had high hopes of gaining something from the negotiations, but yesterday's Tokyo Asahi Shimbun reported that Foreign Minister Nomura had received a memorandum from the U.S. Ambassador, and that he knew "the future is extremely bleak." Not only is this the case with the United States, but Japan also believed that Britain was vulnerable because it was preoccupied with affairs in Europe. However, a recent dispatch from London stated that the British Ambassador to Japan will conduct negotiations in Tokyo, and that Britain does not intend to change its attitude, so the Ambassador has not been given any new instructions. From these two points alone, the failure of Japan's diplomatic offensive can be seen. The fact that awaits future proof is further action by the international community against Japan; judging by the overall situation, the time is not far off.</p>
<p>In terms of political offensives: Japan has been sparing no effort in cultivating puppet regimes in Changchun, Beiping, and Nanjing for several years. This was Japan's original intention and a political offensive. However, as the facts show, it is not appealing enough to China, nor is it deceptive enough to the international community. When the military offensive reached a dead end, it then issued a deceptive statement saying: Its deployment of troops to China was not intended to defeat China, but to establish peace with China. Establishing peace between two countries, if it stems from sincerity, cannot be regarded as a political offensive. However, there is absolutely no fact to prove its sincerity. On the contrary, the hypocrisy is so obvious that it cannot be concealed. Establishing peace between two countries means: taking a sovereign and independent country with complete sovereignty as the absolute condition for "country," taking equality as the necessary condition for "two countries," and taking mutual trust, mutual benefit, mutual affection, and mutual understanding as the proper foundation for peace. The so-called diplomatic statement of last September and the so-called Konoe Declaration of December were vague and superficial, and were not a solid basis for truly seeking to resolve disputes and end conflicts. However, the Japanese defended themselves by saying that the principle was indeed such, but there is no time to elaborate on it now. Judging from the dispatches from Tokyo in the past three to five days, the intentions of the Japanese have been fully revealed. To sum up the main points: what Japan is most eager for is to reorganize the organizations in its military-occupied areas, not to seek peace or solve the Sino-Japanese problem. This is the first point. Japan said that it has no territorial demands, but it calls all of North China, Inner Mongolia, and the so-called triangular areas of Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou special districts. What are called special districts are actually disguised colonies, which in name and in fact do not belong to China. This is the second point. Japan said that it respects Chinese sovereignty, but in the military aspect, it stations troops in Chinese territory; in the political and diplomatic aspects, it forces China to join the anti-communist group. This is the third point. Japan said that it does not interfere in internal affairs, but it says that it is "of course inconvenient to transfer" the customs and railways. This is the fourth point. From these four points alone, it can be seen that Japan's recent plans are not intended to establish peace, but are merely a political offensive. 推 彼 用意， 推 彼 用意， The intended purpose is to implement the political offensive. When the political offensive is realized, it will retreat to the invading military to make a plan to escape like a cicada shedding its skin, and advance to make a plan to secretly transport supplies for the overall invasion plan; furthermore, it will place this "disguised form" before all countries, saying that the "facts created" are such and such, so as to seek the victory of the "diplomatic offensive." However, from our perspective, this ambiguous principle may be effective in the initial political offensive, but as for the above four conditions, who would submit to them? From this, it can be inferred that the "new regime" propagated by Japan will at most become a reorganized局局局局局局局局局局局局局局 of the two puppets in Nanjing and Beiping; in terms of political offensives, it has already been declared a failure based on the above four conditions. This is indeed Japan's latest failure.</p>
<h3 id="e15">President Roosevelt Signs Three Declarations, Implementing New Neutrality Act, Prohibiting Belligerent Submarines from Entering Territorial Waters, and Designating a War Zone in European Waters <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt signed the new Neutrality Act at noon today. Vice President and Senate President Garner, House Speaker Bankhead, Secretary of State Hull, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman, and many members of both the Senate and House of Representatives were present. In addition, the President signed three declarations: one announcing the existence of a state of war in Europe and the immediate implementation of the new Neutrality Act; the second prohibiting submarines of belligerent nations from entering U.S. territorial waters and ports; and the third designating a war zone. The first declaration stated, "I, the President, in accordance with the powers conferred upon me by the Neutrality Act, hereby declare that a state of war unfortunately exists between Germany and France, Poland, Britain, India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa. In order to ensure the safety and peace of the United States and to protect the lives of its citizens, I hereby revoke all previous orders prohibiting the shipment of munitions to those countries." The second declaration stated, "Submarines of all belligerent nations shall henceforth be prohibited from entering U.S. territorial waters and ports, with the exception of the Panama Canal Zone. However, in cases of force majeure, they must fly their national flag and navigate on the surface with their conning tower and deck exposed, both when entering and exiting U.S. territorial waters and ports." The third declaration designated a war zone in European waters, extending from the north of Spain to the British Isles. U.S. ships are prohibited from entering this zone. (The Mediterranean Sea is not included in the war zone.) (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>President Gifts Pens to Two Legislators</p>
<p>Washington - After President Roosevelt signed the Neutrality Act today, the White House announced that the President has issued three neutrality proclamations: (1) declaring the new Neutrality Act; (2) addressing submarine activity; and (3) defining areas where U.S. ships may or may not travel. As the bill was signed at the White House this afternoon, Secretary of State Hull and many members of Congress were present to witness the ceremony. The President also signed two proclamations declaring U.S. neutrality, thus immediately enacting the law and restricting belligerent submarines' use of U.S. ports and territorial waters. The President used two pens, one given to Pittman and one to House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Bloom, in recognition of their assistance in securing passage of the bill in Congress. Laughter filled the White House, indicating the President's great satisfaction. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<p>Secretary of State Hull's Remarks</p>
<p>Washington - Following the enactment of the new Neutrality Act, Secretary of State Hull made a statement to reporters, expressing his satisfaction. He said, "The previous Neutrality Act has been fundamentally amended, which I deeply appreciate. The government has strongly advocated for this amendment since the beginning of the year. Shortly before the outbreak of war in Europe, our government also appealed to all nations to avoid war and maintain peace. I reiterate that now. Our primary responsibility is to guarantee the peace and security of our nation, and I believe we will succeed. The enactment of the new Neutrality Act will help us achieve this goal." A State Department spokesman also told the press that Secretary Hull had requested aircraft manufacturers last year not to sell aircraft to countries that bomb undefended cities. This request remains in effect. Since Secretary Hull made this request last year, all aircraft manufacturers in the country have voluntarily ceased selling aircraft to Japan. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Explanation Regarding War Zone Designation</p>
<p>Washington - After signing the declaration designating a war zone in European waters at 3 p.m. today, President Roosevelt explained that military actions are currently taking place within this zone that "endanger the navigation of American ships." Hereafter, U.S. ships may not travel to ports of belligerent nations in Europe. Ports of neutral countries such as Norway (south of Bergen), Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, and Belgium, as well as ports along the Baltic Sea, are also included in the war zone and are not accessible to U.S. ships. However, U.S. ships may continue to operate normally to ports of neutral countries along the Mediterranean and Black Seas, to ports of belligerent and neutral countries along the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and to ports in Africa south of the Canary Islands belonging to Spain. Furthermore, trade between the United States and Canada, Latin American republics, and islands in the Caribbean will not be affected. U.S. ships that have already sailed to the war zone before the new Neutrality Act and this declaration came into effect will be allowed to complete their voyage. The boundaries of the war zone may be changed as circumstances require. (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>German Official to Make Statement</p>
<p>Berlin - According to well-informed sources, the public announcement expected last night regarding Germany's commentary on the U.S. passage of the new Neutrality Act will be postponed. It is understood that the various provisions and regulations of the new Neutrality Act will be carefully considered before the official German opinion is made public. Therefore, the announcement will not be made until this evening at the earliest. (Haitong Press, 5th)</p>
<p>A Berlin dispatch from Swedish capital newspapers stated that Germany now believes the U.S. has virtually joined the war. The National Socialist Party advocates launching an attack before the Allied-ordered aircraft arrive in Europe. They are currently preparing everything to prove to Britain who controls the skies. Official circles hope to boost national morale with the idea that the British fleet will surely be defeated. Well-informed sources in Berlin say that while British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill enjoyed a leisurely weekend, he will no longer have such weekends in the future. The aerial assault Germany is preparing to inflict on Britain will be unlike anything seen in Poland. The dispatch also stated that it would be inaccurate to say that the continuation of the war excites the German army and air force. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Britain and France Order Submarine Sweepers</p>
<p>London - The naval affairs correspondent of "The People's Newspaper" recently published an article stating that the Allied nations of Britain and France will soon order a large number of submarine sweepers from the United States. "U.S. shipyards can deliver five of these warships per week in the initial phase, and gradually increase the number after mass production begins. These warships are extremely fast, surpassing warships of all other countries in the world. Their endurance is roughly equivalent to crossing the Atlantic Ocean. The bows are sharp as knives, making it easy to cut submarines in two upon impact. In addition, the British government will order several thousand aircraft from the United States in the near future, including a batch ordered on the 3rd of this month, worth a total of £44 million, 900 of which are ready for shipment. The British government will send a delegation to the United States to continue signing contracts with various manufacturers. Although the new U.S. Neutrality Act stipulates cash transactions, the British government has no worries, as it holds U.S. securities worth £1.25 billion and gold worth £500 million, which can be used to pay for the goods."

<h3 id="e16">U.S. Government Formulates New Naval Expansion Plan to Massively Increase Warships and Aircraft, Requiring a Total of $1.3 Billion <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Washington - House Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Vinson recently announced that when Congress convenes in regular session in January, he will introduce a bill calling for an appropriation of $1.3 billion to build 2,395 aircraft, 36 airships, and 126 warships of various sizes, including three aircraft carriers, eight cruisers, fifty-two destroyers, thirty-two submarines, totaling ninety-five vessels with a displacement of 400,000 tons, and thirty-one auxiliary ships with a displacement of 125,000 tons. The above plan can be completed in three to four years. The current U.S. Navy, including the warships already authorized by Congress, is sufficient to cope with any aggressor nation. However, if several countries conspire to attack us, the naval power will be insufficient. Under the current circumstances, the American people need a strong navy to meet all the needs of national defense. "I do not intend to form two fleets, allocated to the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. I only want to maintain a single fleet and strengthen its power. In short, we are not seeking war, nor do we covet foreign land, but we must keep hostile actions away from our coast." (Havas, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington - According to news from here today, the U.S. government will ask Congress next January to approve a new naval expansion plan requiring a total expenditure of US$1.3 billion. According to this plan, the United States will build 95 warships and 2,400 aircraft. According to the opinion of House Naval Affairs Committee Chairman Vinson, this new plan includes the construction of three aircraft carriers, eight cruisers, fifty-two destroyers, thirty-two submarines, and thirty-one auxiliary ships. In addition to aircraft, 36 airships will also be built. (Reuters, 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e17">U.S. Government Establishes Priorities Committee to Prevent Munitions Orders from Impeding U.S. Defense <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>Washington - The U.S. government announced yesterday the establishment of a Government Priorities Committee to prevent large-scale British and French munitions orders from hindering U.S. defense plans. The executive officer of the committee is Colonel Hines. Other members are representatives from the Department of War, the Department of the Navy, the Department of Justice, and the Department of State. It is reported that the committee will advise foreign governments on how to allocate orders to ensure that they do not conflict with the minimum requirements of U.S. orders. Munitions orders about to be fulfilled are worth US$500 million, and larger British and French orders will continue to arrive. The United States' annual defense expenditure is US$2 billion. At this moment, State Department officials indicate that although the arms embargo provision has been repealed, the "moral embargo" on bombs and aircraft used to bomb civilians remains in effect. They indicated that when Roosevelt requested Congress to repeal the arms embargo provision, he sought assurances from the belligerents not to bomb civilians. They claim that although there is no legal embargo on aircraft shipments to Japan, they have been halted through moral persuasion. State Department officials claim that the government intends to ask Congress next January to enact Secretary of State Hull's proposed "moral embargo" against Japan into law, empowering the President to prohibit the export of kerosene, scrap iron, copper, and aircraft to Japan.

<p>Helsinki - The Soviet Union does not intend to contribute to Germany's victory in the current European war. It is unwilling for Germany to achieve victory in a short period, because Hitler would then become the master of Europe. According to observers familiar with the inside story, the Soviet Union's distrust of Hitler is no different from a month ago. At the same time, the Soviet Communist Party still regards democratic countries as insignificant. The hidden danger still lies with Hitler, so they must make various preparations against him. Stalin's only hope at present is to gain enough time to develop the Soviet Union's vast resources and strengthen its position. Fundamentally, the Soviet Union has always been suspicious and fearful of Germany and has no goodwill toward Britain. Therefore, it is a good thing to have the war deplete the strength of both countries. In this situation, the Soviet Union can sit back and watch the situation change and act accordingly. As for establishing a trade agreement with Germany, it is also a convenient arrangement for the Soviet Union. If Germany has goods to exchange, the Soviet Union will definitely fulfill the agreement without any doubt. However, the Soviet Union will not supply Germany with all its surplus materials after signing the barter agreement with Germany. The Soviet Union will continue to maintain trade with Britain, the United States, and other countries. Germany certainly needs the Soviet Union's assistance economically, but the assistance it receives is not limited to economics. First, since the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, it has made it impossible for the Soviet Union to conclude a military alliance with Britain and France. Second, Germany is no longer threatened by the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front. As for the Soviet Union's economic assistance to Germany, such as iron ore, pig iron, magnesium, grain, butter, and gasoline, it is certainly not a problem according to the current production volume of the Soviet Union. However, the problem is transportation, because the width of the Soviet railway is different, and vehicles cannot be directly transported to Germany. Goods must be loaded and unloaded at the border for transshipment. In addition, there is a lack of vehicles for transporting gasoline on both sides. As for maritime transportation through the Baltic Sea, there is also a lack of oil tankers. Therefore, this problem will be difficult to solve properly in the coming months. As for military cooperation, at most, the Soviet Union can take joint action with Germany when attacking Romania, but it will only be satisfied with recovering Bessarabia and will not take any further action beyond this. Therefore, there is absolutely no question of fighting side by side. (Associated Press, 5th)</p>
<h3 id="e20">Britain Arrests German Diplomats, Germany Announces the Truth <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>Berlin - The "German News Agency" yesterday published a lengthy statement regarding the imprisonment of German consular officials in Glasgow, England, by the British side, declaring that the arrest and imprisonment of the German consul was completely illegal, as the arrest took place twenty hours before the British government declared war on Germany. In other words, the British government arbitrarily arrested German diplomats in peacetime. On September 2, Consul Lipske was arrested by the British government, and his female secretary, Wagner, was also arrested at the same time and detained in a women's prison. Another consulate staff member, Afis, was arrested and imprisoned on the morning of September 3 (also before the declaration of war). When they inquired about the reason for their arrest, British officials only replied that the order came from London and refused to answer further. The British authorities ignored the provisions of international law and completely confiscated and thoroughly inspected the consulate's official documents and files, and forced Lipske to open the secret safe. Although Mr. Li was a German consul, the treatment he received in the British prison was the same as that of ordinary criminals. He was not allowed to contact the outside world, nor was he allowed to report his arrest to the German Embassy in Britain. At the same time, various valuables such as watches, rings, and even security knives were confiscated. This treatment has lasted for twenty-one days without any court proceedings. The female secretary, Wagner, was forced to clean toilets in prison for a total of one month. Another staff member, Afist, was also detained for twenty-three days. In short, the arrest of German consular officials in Glasgow took place before the declaration of war, and after the arrest, their rights as consuls were not respected. In addition, German people living in Iraq, Egypt, India, and South Africa were also illegally arrested one, two, or even three days before the declaration of war. Although Britain is known for its humanitarianism and international law, its actions are completely contradictory. The facts are obvious to everyone. (Haitong News Agency, 5th)</p>

<p>Tokyo - Although the statement issued by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the meeting between U.S. Ambassador Grew and Foreign Minister Nomura yesterday was of an informal nature, today's newspapers all said that this conversation was the first resolution meeting to discuss adjusting U.S.-Japan relations. The Asahi Shimbun reported that U.S. Ambassador Grew handed Foreign Minister Nomura a memorandum, the content of which was virtually the same as the U.S. Ambassador's speech on October 20. In short, it declared that the United States currently finds it difficult to recognize the new situation in the Far East. It is heard that the memorandum also stated that the U.S. government believes that the intention of the "New Order in East Asia" is to create Japan's control position in the Far East, and its economic exclusionism is in conflict with the principles of open door and equal opportunity. The U.S. government feels that its national historical rights and interests have been harmed as a result, and said that the American public is very angry about Japan's bombing in China and other means of dealing with American interests. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>Chongqing - Today's editorial in the Central Daily News here, entitled "Roosevelt's Immortal Work," stated that the United States has gradually adopted a diplomatic policy in the Far East of restraining aggression and restoring world peace. "Judging from the news coming from Tokyo, Japan has no other choice but to adopt a diplomatic policy of 'abjectly trying to please' the United States in order to prolong its life. On the other hand, Japan knows that its own position and the position of the United States are absolutely incompatible. To start negotiations with the United States is no different from wasting time, but it cannot but perfunctorily deal with it. What the Japanese spokesperson called the current US-Japan negotiations are not formal negotiations, which is enough to expose their contradictory psychology. Japan is currently in extreme distress, and the passage of the new U.S. Neutrality Act is sufficient to prove that U.S. peaceful diplomacy has returned to the international stage." Referring to what U.S. House Islands Committee Chairman Coxski said, it is not appropriate to seek to order the neutralization of the Philippines at the current international environment, the newspaper believes that "Today's United States is ready to act, and will no longer be satisfied with ideological empty words. The implementation of this diplomatic policy of the United States will inevitably lead to the restraint of aggression and the restoration of world peace. This is Roosevelt's immortal work, and it is also the historical mission of the United States." (Associated Press, 5th)</p>

<p>Helsinki - Finnish Prime Minister Cajander delivered a radio address last night, in which he said that Finland is prepared to defend itself in all situations. Cajander strongly opposed the Soviet Union's two main demands. Cajander spoke of the proposal to cede Finnish territory in the Karelian Isthmus, saying that the Soviet Union's intention to make Leningrad impregnable cannot be achieved at the expense of Finland's security. The Soviet Union is concerned about the proximity of some islands and the position of the Finnish border to Leningrad, but this cannot be a reason to demand that Finland withdraw its border or remove border defenses. Finland must consider its own national defense. The Soviet Union's proposal to establish its naval base in Finland's territory at the mouth of the Gulf of Finland is incompatible with Finland's integrity and independence. Although the land that the Soviet Union promised to exchange is vast, it is of no military importance. Therefore, Finland's position is completely opposite to that of the Soviet Union. Finland is very willing to live in peace with all countries and develop its national life. Finland will never allow itself to be used by others as a starting point for aggression against the Soviet Union. This can be guaranteed to the Soviet Union, but anything that can undermine Finland's neutrality or hinder its future cooperation with the Scandinavian countries, Finland must not agree to it. Cajander also rejected the Soviet Union's statement that other countries are currently putting pressure on Finland. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<p>Berlin Very Anxious About Finland's Fate</p>
<p>Swedish Capital - A Berlin dispatch from "Svenska Dagbladet" stated that political circles in Berlin are very anxious about Finland's fate and are eagerly awaiting the results of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations. It is generally believed that an article recently published by the Soviet government organ "Pravda" is sufficient to prove that the Soviet Union is determined to take the opportunity to profit and expand its power. However, the Nazis believe that it is not too late to obtain a peaceful solution. People in Berlin regard the "Pravda" article as a tactical move. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union's request to cede the Finnish Hanko port is the main point of contention between the two sides. If Finland cedes the Utö Island east of the Elendt Islands, the Soviet Union's security can also be equally guaranteed. The dispatch also stated that if the Soviet Union goes to war with Finland, it will cause Germany to worry, but the Germans who are friendly to Finland have to remain passively silent.

It is generally believed that negotiations on the Soviet Union's request to establish naval bases on the Hanko Peninsula and Peterzamo Port are nearing a resolution. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Paris - The radio address delivered by the Prime Minister of Finland has recently been commented on by political figures here. It is generally believed that the Prime Minister's remarks are a "courageous move" after the Soviet Communist Party's newspaper "Pravda" published a commentary yesterday, fiercely attacking Finland. Although the situation of the Soviet-Finnish negotiations is still unknown, the shared culture of the Scandinavian Peninsula countries will undoubtedly play an important role in the Soviet-Finnish negotiations. Generally, the crux of the negotiations is Finland's concession of fortress areas on the Soviet border and land near Hanko Port to the Soviet Union. This situation is exactly the same as Germany's request to Czechoslovakia in September last year to cede the Sudetenland fortress area to Germany. However, it is not easy for the Soviet Union to invade Finland. The area where the Soviet Union and Finland border each other is a lake and swamp area, and the Finnish authorities have built fortifications there. In addition, the Finnish coast is mostly reed-filled beaches, and the ports have been mined. In this situation, the Soviet Union will encounter great resistance in both land and sea attacks.

At the outbreak of World War I, the ninth German submarine sank three British armored cruisers on September 14, 1914. To commemorate his achievements, the German government awarded him the Iron Cross to encourage him. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>London - Former Czechoslovak President Beneš recently published an article in "The Sunday Times," stating, "I firmly believe that the independence of my country will be restored. No one can enslave our country's eight million people forever. Our nation cannot thrive under oppression. We plan to emulate the Polish nation's method of establishing a government in France and temporarily establish a new government in Britain to help the Allied countries restore independence. This matter is being discussed with the relevant countries. In any case, we plan to emulate the method used during the last European war and form a Czech army in France to recover our territory. In short, we are determined to fight to restore our homeland. This is a universally recognized matter and one of the basic goals of the current war. However, less than three months have passed since the start of the war, and everything is still in its initial stages. We should only be persistent and not act hastily." Beneš then reviewed the issue of the German minority in the Czech Republic, stating, "These people are the best-treated minority in all of Europe. Our country has only been established for 20 years, and it is difficult to satisfy everyone. We have been controlled by foreign countries for hundreds of years. All we need is time. If Hitler had not interfered, we would have been able to resolve all issues peacefully in another ten years. The establishment of our country was based on the right to national self-determination, so how could we despise the right to self-determination of three million Germans? As of today, the right to self-determination of eight million Czechs has been restricted by three million Germans. Those who advocate for the rights of minorities, I don't know how they can justify themselves. Moreover, political issues are not as simple as generally imagined. The only solution is to find a compromise. Once the current war ends, if Europe needs to be transformed, the foundation of the transformation will be to restrict the sovereignty of all countries, especially certain countries. Our country will definitely contribute to this new form of international life. In short, we should accept all restrictive measures politically and economically, but only on the condition that other countries do the same. If the world can find reasonable solutions to all problems based on freedom and democracy, our country will not raise any objections." Beneš concluded, "I do not believe that the current war will last for a long time. I don't know if I am mistaken." (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>London - According to well-informed sources here, the key points of the mutual assistance treaty between Britain, France, and Turkey are: (1) If a European country attacks Turkey or involves Turkey in a Mediterranean war through aggression, Britain and France must assist Turkey. (2) If a European country involves Britain and France in a Mediterranean war through aggression, or if Britain and France are at war due to guarantees to Greece and Romania, Turkey must assist Britain and France. (3) In the event that a European country commits an act of aggression against another country, if any of the three countries, Britain, France, and Turkey, has an obligation to maintain the neutrality or independence of the attacked country, or believes that its own security is threatened, it should immediately discuss joint action. (4) The treaty is for a period of 15 years. (5) Turkey does not have to take action involving war against the Soviet Union. According to well-informed sources, Turkey was an ally of Germany during the last European war, but this situation has completely changed now. This treaty is the most important factor in stabilizing the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean and Southeastern Europe. Turkey is not only a powerful country in the Balkan Group, but also the leader of the Muslim countries (i.e., Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan), so the influence of this treaty extends very far.

<p>Oslo - After being released by a Norwegian warship in Hergeson Bay, Norway, yesterday, the "Flint City" arrived at Bergen Port this morning. The American crew members who had encountered adversity for 15 days were very happy to regain their freedom. As for the German sailors, they are now detained on a Norwegian warship. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Bergen Port, Norway - The Norwegian Navy Department announced yesterday that the "Flint City" is an unarmed freighter and can enjoy complete neutrality rights. The ship was released in Hergeson on Friday evening. The German crew members who had been guarding the ship stayed there without the permission of the Norwegian authorities. "The Flint City" arrived here and docked yesterday afternoon, flying the American flag. This is the first time the American flag has been raised since the ship was captured by the German warship. Norwegian warships are now on guard near the ship. Except for Norwegian official ships, other ships are not allowed to approach the ship. The Norwegian authorities are on guard because the German government has protested to the Norwegian government, questioning the impropriety of releasing the American ship. The captain of the "Flint City" has reported all the details to the American Consul here, Dunlap, and is awaiting instructions to consider how to continue the voyage, pass through the blockade line, and sail directly to the United States. According to the ship's crew members who spoke to reporters visiting the ship, their adventure is not over yet. They expressed pessimism about whether the ship can return to American territory. The American crew members of the ship are completely safe and sound, and the cargo has not been moved. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington - After the Norwegian government released the American freighter "Flint City" in accordance with international law and detained the German sailors on board, the American government immediately expressed its gratitude to the Norwegian government.

<h3 id="e33">British and French Naval Cooperation Possesses Great Power, British Convoy System Achieves Remarkable Results, Two Danish and Norwegian Ships Sink in North Sea <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>London - The Ministry of Information issued a communiqué yesterday, praising the close cooperation between the French Navy and the British and French fleets, which was reprinted by various morning newspapers. It stated, "The fact that our Naval Minister Churchill recently held talks with French Naval Minister Campinchi and Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Darlan fully proves the close cooperation between the British and French navies in fighting Germany. As of today, the French Navy has strong military power. Based on realism, the French government had long anticipated that Germany would one day turn to attack the democratic countries of Western Europe, so it trained its navy in the manner most suitable for fighting Germany. The strength of all kinds of warships is superior to Germany's. Before the outbreak of the war, it already had seven battleships, two of which were 27,000-ton battlecruisers with high speed, equipped with 13-inch guns, which are most suitable for dealing with Germany's pocket battleships. France built this type of battlecruiser to 'respond' to Germany's pocket battleships. As for cruisers, France currently has seven first-class cruisers with the highest speed, all equipped with 8-inch guns, eleven second-class cruisers, all equipped with 6-inch guns, and thirty-two light cruisers with extremely high speed (each with a tonnage of about 2,500 tons), all equipped with 5-inch guns. In addition, France also has 46 new-type destroyers, 79 submarines, and many auxiliary ships of various types. Using such a powerful fleet to maintain the maritime advantage of Britain and France is of great importance. Moreover, the strength of the French Navy is not only limited to material strength. French naval generals such as former Naval Minister Le Grigg and other famous generals have all occupied a glorious page in naval history, which is enough to ensure that the country's navy possesses great power. The British and French fleets have cooperated closely since the beginning of the war. They had previously cooperated with each other by implementing maritime surveillance measures during the Spanish Civil War, so this joint operation can be easily mastered and obtain convenience. As of now, British and French warships have been cooperating closely on three matters: patrolling the sea, escorting merchant ships, and searching for submarines. In addition, the French Navy is also extremely active in cutting off Germany's overseas trade and intercepting German merchant ships. For example, the country's submarine recently intercepted the German merchant ship "Minizhi" and forced it to sail to a French port. In short, the friendly cooperation between the British and French navies is increasing day by day. The meeting between Naval Minister Churchill and the French naval authorities is proof of this cooperation." (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>London - Observers here commented on the success of the British Navy's maritime efforts, saying that in two months, Britain captured 500,000 tons of important goods that Germany relied on for war, while Germany only captured one ship with a load of 5,000 tons. Only one ton of goods out of every hundred tons entering and leaving British ports was lost, while Germany could not transport even one ton out of every hundred tons. Although Britain lost 220,000 tons of ships, it has made up for it with newly built ships and captured German ships. The speed at which Britain builds new ships is four times the number of tons lost. British merchant ships are now traveling 139 million miles at sea, while German ships are limited to the Baltic Sea, which covers only 15.8 million miles. The British convoy system has achieved remarkable results, with the loss of escorted ships being less than 1%. Britain has 15 capital ships, and only lost the "Oak" class. Britain has seven aircraft carriers, and only lost the "Courageous" class, while the number of German submarines sunk or heavily damaged by Britain accounts for one-third of the 60 submarines that Germany had at the start of the war. Britain and France now have four times as many capital ships as Germany and nine times as many cruisers as Germany. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>London - According to today's news, two more neutral ships have sunk. One is the Norwegian ship "Seagull", which sank five minutes after an explosion in the North Sea. Fifteen of the ship's crew escaped and landed at a port on the northeast coast. Three people are missing. The other is the 11,000-ton Danish ship "Canada", which sank today after an explosion on Friday. Five tugboats had attempted to rescue it last night, but eventually gave up. The captain told a reporter that the ship had an explosion, but he could not say why. The ship's 60 crew members left the ship in small boats, but because the ship seemed to be in danger of sinking immediately, the captain and 13 other crew members returned to the ship, but the ship was still doomed to sink, so they escaped in lifeboats.

<p>Paris - German reconnaissance planes flew over central France and the Rhineland yesterday, without dropping any bombs. German artillery and scouts concentrated their activities in the triangle of Forbach, Saarbrücken, and Saargemünd.

French observers claimed that 20 shells fell in the Forbach area, but the losses were minimal. Germany has increased the number of artillery pieces southeast of Saarbrücken, and French artillery fire is as fierce as German artillery fire, frequently firing into the German rear. (Associated Press dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>London - The German army on the Western Front has taken no action two months after the start of the war. British political figures have commented on this situation, or believe that this situation is because the German army is secretly preparing new and extremely cruel tactics, which is incredible, because Britain does not have any information to prove that Germany has new inventions in artillery warfare or chemical warfare. Germany's intention is nothing more than to spread rumors among the neutral countries to create a psychological fear. Some say that Hitler seems to be trying to preserve his strength and get through the winter, while carrying out diplomatic activities in Eastern and Central Europe and slowly developing. Others say that Hitler intends to maintain the current military stalemate, making Britain and France feel tired, thereby causing a peace movement among the neutral countries, which is not necessarily impossible. Military experts say that Germany's resources are limited, and its only hope is to achieve a quick victory. Moreover, the reports of how excellent the German Air Force was before the war have been proven to be inaccurate. Once Britain and France purchase high-speed aircraft from the United States, the German Air Force will not be its opponent. In this situation, the country must achieve a quick victory. However, Hitler's operational policy is hesitant and unpredictable. However, the military authorities of Britain and France are confident and unperturbed, and are not disturbed by this.

<h3 id="e36">European War and Far Eastern Trade by Baemin, written by John Ashworth, translated from Millard's Review <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>The first two months of the European war have passed, but they have not brought about general prosperity in Far Eastern trade; moreover, such prosperity remains elusive. British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies can indeed ship increased quantities of tin, rubber, and other tropical agricultural products to Europe and the United States. On the other hand, the foreign commerce of China and Japan has decreased significantly, far more than the increase in trade in Southeast Asia. As the war in the Old World enters its third month, the outlook for Far Eastern trade remains generally precarious, with little hope for an early increase in overall commercial volume.</p>
<p>China's foreign trade in September and October was exceptionally poor. Restrictions on Allied shipping in East Asian waters forced many goods destined for Shanghai to be offloaded at ports in British and French colonies. New export restrictions imposed by several belligerent and neutral European countries completely cut off some sources of supply for Shanghai. On the other hand, the gradual strengthening of Chinese legal tender, new controls on trade and exchange rates in the British and French Far Eastern colonies, and new restrictions on European imports all damaged Shanghai's exports. Tianjin, China's second most important trading center, suffered severe commercial losses due to floods in the autumn of this year, with imports in September decreasing by 70% and exports decreasing by 94% compared to August. At the same time, transit trade through Hong Kong and French Vietnam in "Free China" encountered more difficulties due to the new control systems in those two places.</p>
<p>As a result of these developments, China's imports fell from 53,900,000 Customs Gold Units in August to 34,900,000 Customs Gold Units in September. At the same time, China's exports also decreased from 100,900,000 legal tender yuan to 85,400,000 yuan. The most significant declines in China's imports were in metals, machinery, vehicles, hardware, timber, paper, sugar, and tobacco. The decline in exports was greatest for domestic products, especially agricultural and livestock products. Imports from Germany were halved, and German shipping to Chinese ports has completely ceased.</p>
<p>China's inability to obtain some commonly used supplies from Western countries would naturally have been an excellent opportunity for Japan to continue to expand its trade with China at the expense of other countries. However, recent economic developments in Japan proper have prevented the Japanese from taking advantage of this opportunity. In early autumn of this year, a severe shortage of various goods in Japan has damaged Japan's export capacity. Therefore, the decline in Japan's exports to China in September was no less than the decline in China's imports from other countries. Japan's share of China's total imports, at 30%, has not increased.</p>
<p>Japan's exports to the countries of the yen bloc have indeed declined this autumn. Japan's inability to supply Manchuria and North China with machinery and steel according to various development plans has forced it to revise these plans, reduce their scope, and extend their duration. The frequently publicized Manchurian industrial development five-year plan has also had to be abandoned. Japan's exports to countries outside the yen bloc were able to maintain their level throughout September, but they fell sharply in October. From October 11 to 20, the value of Japanese exports was 91,000,000 yen, which was 28,500,000 yen less than in the first ten days of the previous month, and almost 85,000,000 yen less than in the last ten days of September. Japan's imports were 80,800,000 yen in the first ten days of October, and decreased to 72,900,000 yen in the subsequent ten days. The actual decline in Japanese trade is much greater than these figures suggest, because the value of the yen has fallen by about 20% following the depreciation of the pound sterling.</p>
<p>The outbreak of the European war has greatly harmed Manchuria. Manchuria's important exports are soybeans and their products, soybean oil and soybean cake. Apart from Japan proper, the most important customer was Germany. The Allied blockade has hindered these products from being shipped directly to Germany or carried to neutral ports. Several Japanese ships loaded with Manchurian products bound for Hamburg were intercepted by the British and French navies and forced to unload at Allied ports. The Japanese immediately began negotiations on behalf of Manchuria and Moscow, hoping to obtain Soviet permission to use the Trans-Siberian Railway for large-scale transit trade between Japan and Germany.</p>
<p>Since trade in Japan, Manchuria, and China proper decreased significantly in September, it is not surprising that Hong Kong's trade also suffered a major setback. Hong Kong has always been the main base for British trade in the Far East, and this reduction in shipping has certainly damaged Hong Kong's commerce. Hong Kong's exports in September were worth 42,500,000 Hong Kong dollars, a decrease of 2,300,000 Hong Kong dollars compared to August. However, Hong Kong's imports also decreased from 52,100,000 Hong Kong dollars in August to 39,900,000 Hong Kong dollars in September, a decline of almost a quarter. The Hong Kong government does not implement the new British wartime trade and exchange controls as strictly as other British colonies, perhaps because trade has already decreased sharply. Of all British territories in the East, Hong Kong maintains the greatest degree of economic freedom.</p>
<p>Trade in Singapore, further south, seems to be thriving. In the Straits Settlements' imports and exports in September, transit trade with the Dutch East Indies, French Vietnam, and Laos has indeed declined. However, British Malaya's own trade has increased significantly, with exports of rubber and tin both increasing. Singapore's exports of tin in September were six times higher than a month earlier, exceeding the record figure of 10,000 tons. Newspapers have reported that Singapore is suffering from a lack of shipping facilities, but the British authorities have denied this. The export industries of the Dutch East Indies, especially rubber, tin, palm oil, and coconut kernels, have also increased significantly, but customers prefer to ship directly from Batavia and Surabaya, rather than through Singapore, to avoid the new British trade and exchange controls there.</p>
<p>If the increase in exports from Southeast Asian countries is sustained for some time, the result will inevitably be a sharp economic boom in these countries, and a significant increase in the purchasing power of the East Indies. This seems to open up new export possibilities for both China and Japan. Since Japan is trapped in the suffering of commodity shortages and various economic controls, Shanghai's industries will eventually benefit from the improved situation in British Malaya and the Dutch East Indies, and get a good opportunity. But apart from this, there is little obvious hope for an early large-scale prosperity in Far Eastern trade. The Sino-Japanese War continues to devastate China and drain Japan's economic resources, and the two major countries of the Far East are consuming their respective strengths.</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent Report from London, Shudi</p>
<p>Second, Poland Resists</p>
<p>Compared to Germany's invasion of Poland, what is even more surprising is Poland's resolute resistance. This should first be attributed to the success of British diplomacy towards Poland; its decision can then be attributed to the high level of resistance sentiment in Poland itself. Poland's war this time is for its own sake, but on the other hand, in theory and in practice, it is absolutely, truly, for the benefit of Britain and France!</p>
<p>Here, we need to look back at Poland's attitude on the eve of the German invasion.</p>
<p>During the days after the signing of the "Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact" in late August, when Germany's decision to invade Poland was causing a great uproar, the busiest country in Europe was Germany, followed by Britain and France. The most composed country was Italy, and perhaps some would say the Soviet Union? But it wasn't; it was Poland, the one bearing the brunt of the invasion!</p>
<p>At this time, why was it so confident? A strong cloud of doubt had been shrouding the thoughts of British and French authorities. Therefore, declarations such as "Never yield," "No room for compromise," "When Poland is invaded, Britain and France will be drawn into the war," etc., were being issued daily. However, the response from Poland was as faint as a footstep in an empty valley.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was an even larger shadow looming, namely: the failure of British-Polish military negotiations. When everyone's attention was focused on the British, French, and Soviet military negotiations in Moscow, the Polish military delegation quietly arrived in London. The most important missions of this delegation were: first, to determine the specific cooperation methods for British and French assistance to Poland in the event of war; second, to determine the specific methods for Soviet assistance to Poland in the event of war. Poland's main hope was still limited to assistance with equipment and armaments, with particular emphasis on aircraft and air force. Third, Poland requested to send representatives to the Moscow negotiations.</p>
<p>These military negotiations dragged on for a long time without any results. Finally, after the British, French, and Soviet negotiations were disbanded due to the Soviet-German pact, these negotiations were also indefinitely shelved. Then, just as this delegation declared that it was about to leave Britain, the eve of the German invasion arrived.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that in recent years, the improvement of Poland's international status has been largely due to its skillful use of diplomacy on all sides; its essence is: straddling Germany and the Soviet Union. Now, there is a temporary tacit understanding between the Soviet Union and Germany. On the other hand, Hitler was ostensibly advising Britain and France not to meddle in Poland's affairs, but in reality, he was pressuring Poland through Italy to collude with Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>Under such a shadow, what attitude would Poland take towards the German invasion? No one dared to say!</p>
<p>However, British diplomacy became particularly active. The first major success that surprised many people was the official announcement of the "British-Polish Mutual Assistance Agreement"; as a result, not only did the original Polish military delegation extend its stay, but another group of military personnel departed from Warsaw and embarked on a journey to Britain.</p>
<p>Then, at the time of the German invasion, the facts were revealed: Poland finally resisted!</p>
<p>Under what kind of determination and estimation did Poland take the step of resisting? This is what will be outlined here in a general way.</p>
<p>If we simply see the nature of Poland's response to the war as resistance to aggression, similar to China's current war against Japan, then we are mistaken. Clearly, Poland's ambitions are not just passively defensive; it has greater active intentions. In recent years, the success of its diplomatic efforts, coupled with the result of domestic military buildup, Poland has long shown signs of outward development. Last year's forceful occupation of Lithuanian territory and Czech territory were, in fact, merely small tests of this trend. Its future expansion targets are probably Hungary first, followed by the Balkans, then the Baltic Sea countries, and finally Soviet Ukraine.</p>
<p>In its confrontation with Germany, in its diplomacy with Britain, and in its recent negotiations with Italy, we can notice a very remarkable phenomenon, that is; everywhere it is vying for the upper hand, and it is stubbornly, sometimes surprisingly. This not-so-simple phenomenon is also explaining that trend of outward expansion; otherwise, it would not be necessary.</p>
<p>If we study it from various aspects, it is likely that until Germany began its invasion, Poland was still stubbornly holding on to the belief that Germany would not expand the war situation; at most, it would only be seizing Danzig and the "corridor" area. If that were the case, Poland would never give in. Even if it suffered military setbacks, it would continue to fight, putting Germany in a situation where it could not stop. This point, in its contact with Italy, it had clearly told Italy in advance. In that situation, Germany would eventually either automatically concede to Poland and end the war; or stop the war through Mussolini's mediation. If this situation could arise, then afterwards, Germany would of course never have another chance to talk about Danzig and the "corridor"; and under the situation where Poland's international prestige had greatly increased, the Baltic coast would of course become its sphere of influence; if it could succeed in Hungary as well, then in the future it could share the Balkans with Italy equally. That was the situation that Poland hoped for the most, in order to realize its ideals of recent years. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e39">Rice Prices in Various Counties of Jiangnan are Unlikely to Decrease due to Obstacles in Supply and Overlapping Taxes <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Since the new grain harvest in various counties of Jiangnan, rice prices have not fallen due to special circumstances, and the people are suffering and living from day to day. For example, in Suzhou and Wuxi, the rice industry has held meetings and wants to automatically lower prices. The new high-quality white japonica rice is only allowed to be sold at 17 yuan and 7 jiao per stone, but in fact, prices are still soaring. Examining the reasons: (1) At this time of transition between the old and new grains, the shops are empty of stock and rely entirely on the supply of new rice for replenishment. Unexpectedly, since the early rice was harvested, the arrival of goods has never been abundant. Therefore, the price difference between new and old rice is only two or three yuan, and a large drop has not been possible. This is because transportation in rural areas farther from the city is blocked by guerrillas. Farmers cannot transport their rice to the city for sale. Even inter-village transportation is difficult. (2) Recently, the rice ban in Wujiang and Kunshan counties has been relaxed. Those who could not previously transport and sell to Shanghai have been allowed to circulate by the Japanese. Although rice prices in Shanghai have recently dropped by more than ten yuan, they are still much higher than in the mainland. (3) The common people's staple food, ke xian rice, has always relied on merchants from the Jingwu area for transportation. After the war, these merchants have disappeared due to heavy taxes and levies. Therefore, various types of ke xian rice are in short supply in the market. Common people who eat ke xian rice have switched to eating du xian rice. In terms of consumption, the loss of a major source of supply has resulted in the sales of du rice becoming more and more widespread. Given all these factors, how can rice prices be suppressed? It is easier said than done to hope for a return to lower prices. The current solution is to first facilitate the transport of rice from the upper reaches of the river to the lower reaches, so that rice prices in Jiangnan may be lowered. Currently, rice grains are blocked in rural areas, and there is no free transportation and circulation in various places. Moreover, there are multiple taxes and levies, and rice merchants experience great hardship and only earn meager profits. If something goes wrong along the way, all their capital will be lost. This is another reason why rice prices have failed to fall.</p>

Both teams boasted undefeated records, and Lido had never met Tung Wah since its inception. Therefore, yesterday's battle was nothing less than a semi-final for the Group A leadership and a battle for the Chinese championship. As a result, despite being a Sunday morning, the north and south stands of Yiyuan were packed to the brim with people of all ages, scrambling to get in. It is estimated that there were eight or nine thousand fans, setting a new record for this year. Even the grand occasion of last year's charity match was probably not as good.</p>
<p>The result of the battle was indeed that the two sides were evenly matched. In terms of strength, Lido was slightly better, winning 2-1. Lido scored two goals in the first half, and Tung Wah launched a fierce counterattack in the second half. Dai Linjing broke through and scored one goal. Tung Wah had frequent opportunities after that, and Lido's initial advantage faded, with alarms ringing frequently in front of their goal. However, Tung Wah regrettably failed at the last moment and eventually succumbed to defeat. To seek revenge, they must wait until the second round on February 17th next year. The two teams lined up as follows yesterday:</p>
<p>Lido Team</p>
<p>Lu Zhongen</p>
<p>Li Yichen Zhang Lingen</p>
<p>Jiang Chao Meng Yiliang Jiang Zhaoxiang</p>
<p>Cao Qiuting Sun Jinshun Huang Kehou Xu Wenkui Wu Qixiang</p>
<p>Tung Wah Team</p>
<p>Qin Bigao</p>
<p>Chen Hongguang Zhuang Youren</p>
<p>Shu Shigeng Cai Shengmiao Wang Cuixing</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua Wan Jin Dai Linjing Wu Binghao Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Performance and Gains and Losses</p>
<p>The closeness of the score reflects the tense atmosphere of the field. The two teams are of the same origin, so they played with extreme courtesy, clearly and wonderfully. This is the most satisfying performance. Victory and defeat are certainly not the biggest goal of the game. The referee, Shen Huichun, was also very competent and satisfying. As for the reasons for victory, defeat, gains, and losses, they can be described as follows. Lido's talent is average and lively. Except for Lu Zhongen and Jiang Chao, the attack and defense are both good. Tung Wah's two inside forwards are very weak, which greatly reduces their connection and attacking power. They often suffer from being incompatible and even fall into individual battles. The three generals of the defense, Qin, Chen, and Zhuang, are indeed better than Lido. Yesterday's performance by Chen Hongguang can be said to be unique. The veteran's skills are still there. Qin Bigao made countless saves. Because of the sharpness of Lido's forwards, Tung Wah's strategy was mostly defensive. Because the defense was breached twice, Lido's forwards did not seem to fully display their strengths yesterday, while the three generals of the defense line, Li, Meng, and Jiang, provided support from the rear, which also gave them a great advantage in terms of momentum.</p>
<p>Lido</p>
<p>The great battle began. In the first ten minutes, both sides were caught in a mixed battle. Cai Shengsen's free kick from 30 yards was as sharp and rapid as a cannonball, but it unfortunately went wide. Ah Dai headed the ball, and it grazed the crossbar. Lido attacked the goal, Kehou knocked down Qin Bigao, and Sun Jinshun's shot near the goal was kicked out by Hongguang's leg. Wu Qixiang crossed the ball, and Zhuang Youren intercepted it in mid-air. Ah Kui shot, and Bigao caught it. Sun Jinshun's iron leg flew up, only ten yards from the goal, but Hongguang quickly intercepted it. This situation lasted for as long as twenty-five minutes. Jiang Chao made a long pass from the middle of the field, and Ah Kui deliberately jumped over it, allowing Kehou to shoot. A flat kick from 20 yards hit the left post and bounced into the net.</p>
<p>Record</p>
<p>At the beginning, Lido attacked first. Three minutes later, Sun, Xu, and Huang passed in a small triangle, penetrating Tung Wah's defense. Ah Kui passed to Qixiang, who arrived at the baseline like lightning and shot diagonally with his left foot, flying into the net. Tung Wah lost two goals in a row, and the army rushed forward. Wu Binghao crossed the ball, Ah Dai diverted the ball, allowing Wan Jin to attack the goal. A shot from 20 yards went a foot above the crossbar. Tung Wah poured out all its forces to counterattack, but ultimately failed. Lido thus led by two goals in the first half.</p>
<p>Lemon</p>
<p>Afterwards, Lido initially planned to preserve the victory, so Tung Wah launched a fierce attack, but they did not get luck, and ultimately did not succeed. Cai Shengmiao made a long shot from 35 yards, which was caught by Changlu, who then made a long pass to the front line. Qiuting intercepted and rushed forward, passing Youren and reaching the side of Tung Wah's goal. Unfortunately, he used too little force when kicking the goal, and the ball went to the right. Sun Jinshun was very close, but it touched the crossbar and bounced into a baseball. Tung Wah gradually saw a turning point, and its morale greatly improved. Thus, it turned from guest to host. Ah Dai took advantage of Youliang's corner kick to make a fierce shot, putting Lido in a desperate situation. Meng Yiliang lost his footing, and Li Yichen was unable to save it. Finally, after 13 minutes, they broke through the defense zone, and Lu Zhongen formed an empty goal. Dai calmly kicked, and Changlu lunged in the air, and the ball slowly rolled in from under Changlu's arm. After 2 to 1, Tung Wah's offensive became even stronger, and Lido also defended with offense. The situation became increasingly tense at this point. Both sides had dangerous moves. At the most tense moment, Wu Qixiang suddenly fainted, but fortunately, he soon recovered. At 25 minutes, Zhongshun hooked a shot on the left side, which hit the right corner of the crossbar and bounced down. Qixiang rushed up to intercept, and Qin Bigao knelt down and caught it, to endless cheers.</p>
<p>After this</p>
<p>Lido frequently faced danger. At 38 minutes, Ah Dai made a flat knock from 20 yards, which Lu Zhongen slapped down with one hand, in an extremely dangerous situation. Lido counterattacked, Huang Kehou shot with force, going wide by a foot. Jinshun shot again, and Qin Bigao caught it again. Thus, Tung Wah launched a long-range fierce attack. Meng Yiliang missed the catch, and Ah Dai quickly charged to intercept the free kick that Youliang kicked out, and collided with Changlu again, falling to the ground. The situation was even more dangerous. Before long, the whistle sounded, and Lido finally triumphed 2 to 1.</p>

<h3 id="e51">Re-examination of the Ratio between Sima Scales and Market Scales – Discrepancies in the Discount of Foreign Cotton <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>It can be said that there are no longer any problems with the discount calculation formula for foreign cotton. The various formulas mentioned in the previous two issues of this publication are fully applicable. However, this has led to another new problem: the conversion rate between Sima scales and market scales. This may be an unexpected gain in this discussion.</p>
<p>Surprising Ratio</p>
<p>Everyone knows that numbers are the most truthful and cannot be faked in the slightest. In theory, the conversion rate between different measuring systems should not be off by a hair. At the same time, precisely because numbers cannot be faked in the slightest, there cannot be two different conversion rates. If there are two, one of them must be wrong, and the wrong one should be eliminated.</p>
<p>However, two different conversion rates between Sima scales and market scales have now been discovered. One is an 812 discount, which means that one catty on a Sima scale is equivalent to one catty on a market scale after an 812 discount. This is the ratio used by the editor, and it was published by the Ministry of Industry of the National Government (see page A220 of the "China Economic Yearbook" published by the ministry in 1935, or page X6 of the 1934 edition of the "Shen Bao Yearbook"). Let's call this the "official rate." But there is also an 827 discount, which is said to be stipulated by the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange and is currently commonly used in the market. This means that each catty on a Sima scale is discounted by 827 and treated as one catty on a market scale. Let's call this the "market rate." The original Sima scale had different weights such as Cao Fa and Su Zhu. Its weights were also divided into 17 taels and 2 qian, 17 taels, 16 taels and 8 qian, 16 taels and 6 qian, 16 taels and 5 qian, etc. The National Government fixed the market scale at 13 taels and 6 qian 4 fen. The official rate seems to be calculated based on the Sima scale of 16 taels and 8 qian, while the market rate is calculated based on the Sima scale of 16 taels and 5 qian. Which one is correct remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>These two different discounts will not cause problems in small transactions, but they will make a big difference in large transactions. For example, if you use one Sima dan of US cotton, the difference will be 2 yuan, 5 jiao, 2 fen, and 8 li. The larger the transaction amount, the greater the difference, which is "unacceptable" in normal commercial profits.</p>
<p>Obviously, if the market scale is used as the standard, the market scale weight under the official rate is lighter, and the market scale weight under the market rate is heavier. Conversely, in terms of Sima scales, the Sima scale weight under the official rate is heavier, and the Sima scale weight under the market rate is lighter. Both rates have legal validity, so merchants can choose either one to manipulate the situation.</p>
<p>Since the conversion rates are different, the results will naturally never "meet." But the strange thing is that if they are converted from English and American pounds, they will "converge from different paths" and coincide. The following are examples: There are two legal tender prices for converting one Sima dan of US cotton; one is 140 yuan, 6 jiao, 3 fen, slightly less; and the other is only 138 yuan, 1 jiao. The former is based on the official rate, which is converted to the Sima scale at 1.35768 pounds per catty; the latter is based on the market rate, which is converted to the Sima scale at 1.333... pounds per catty. Different conversion rates naturally lead to different results. However, if the Sima scale price is converted to the market scale price again, whether it is converted according to the official rate of 0.8119; or according to the market rate of 0.82675, the answer is always 114 yuan, 1 jiao, 7 fen, slightly more.</p>
<p>Initially, the editor thought this was a numerical coincidence; so he used another market price for conversion and comparison, and the result was still the same. For example, the aforementioned conversion is based on 12 yuan and 3 fen of legal tender per US dollar and 8.61 cents of US dollar per pound of US cotton. Therefore, assuming 12 yuan and 5 jiao of legal tender per US dollar and 9 cents of US dollar per pound of US cotton, the legal tender price per dan of Sima scale has two values; one is 152 yuan, 639, and the other is 149 yuan, 996, with a difference of 2 yuan, 623. However, the difference in the legal tender price per dan of market scale is only between 124 yuan and 123 yuan, 9276, which can be said to be still consistent.</p>
<h3 id="e52">The Past Week <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The US exchange rate has broken through 9 yuan 3125, and people still hope for a good outcome. Many people are even predicting "when will it exceed 10 yuan?" But some people expressed surprise that the British exchange rate is only hovering around 5 and a half pence. In fact, they forgot that when the British exchange rate just shrank to 5 and a half pence in early July this year, the US exchange rate shrank to 10 yuan 6875 in the same proportion; it was the limping shrinkage of the exchange rate against the British and US dollars that should be surprising. It was not until around the outbreak of the European war that the pound sterling continued to decline against the US dollar that this limping had a reason. Although the pound sterling has not yet improved against the US dollar, the US exchange rate on the Shanghai black market is clearly much harder than the British exchange rate. Therefore, there is a basis for people to hope for a good outcome. (Le Di)</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance recently issued measures for foreign currency fixed deposit savings, stipulating that the four banks of Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, and specially approved commercial banks should handle it. Special interest rates are raised to encourage this. This measure can bring overseas Chinese funds back to China on the one hand, and concentrate foreign currencies in the hands of the people on the other hand, so as to develop domestic economic construction; it can also reduce the manipulation of foreign exchange speculators and make the foreign exchange black market more stable. This is a win-win situation that benefits the country and the people. At present, let alone under the national wartime currency management system, gold, silver, and foreign exchange should all be owned by the state. Even from the perspective of those who hold foreign currencies, instead of storing a lot of foreign currencies in the vault without any interest, it is better to deposit them all in the bank, which can earn a large interest; what's more, the country has endless treasures to guarantee it, which is a million times better than putting it in a dead vault; moreover, there are now examples of vaults not being responsible for safekeeping in certain situations. (Yi Su)</p>
<p>Foreign exchange has crossed the 5 pence and 9 yuan mark, and there is still a tendency to continue to rise. In the past, because foreign exchange shrank, prices of goods soared, and price increase advertisements were published in newspapers. Now that foreign exchange has risen, in theory, the general price level should fall in the same proportion as foreign exchange. However, opening the newspaper, you can't find any price reduction advertisements; and the selling prices of various goods are still the same as when it was three pence. Only Sullivan and Guanshengyuan have a little embellishment; they have published advertisements for implementing price reductions. Nothing else has been found, and some are even rising. It is true that every family has some inventory, but we must not forget that during the sharp price increases, businesses did not sell at a loss for the sake of inventory. (Ying)</p>
<p>Secret Leaks</p>
<p>Since it is not a numerical coincidence, is it a mathematical illusion? Or has it become recreational mathematics? Leaving aside this theoretical issue, the impact on industry and commerce cannot be said to be insignificant! If you are a compradore or a purchasing agent, you can report 140 yuan 628 or 152 yuan 636 to the foreign company or boss, and pay 138 yuan 1 jiao or 149 yuan 996 to the seller; at the same time, you can sell it to the yarn factory for 140 yuan 628 or 152 yuan 636; then, with one turn of the hand, in addition to the normal commission earned, each dan can still have a special income of five or six yuan.</p>
<p>It is obvious that this error only occurs when calculating by Sima scale. If it is calculated by market scale, no matter whether it is directly calculated from US cotton, or converted from Sima scale and then converted to market scale, the results are the same. In terms of the necessary accuracy of the conversion, the Sima scale, which breeds malpractices, should be abolished as soon as possible, and the market scale should be used uniformly. Today, those who insist on using the Sima scale for calculation in the market because of "accumulated habits are hard to change" may have some reasons, but it may not be that they have other purposes.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Various Results Converted at the Official Rate <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>The conversion rate used by the editor is based on the regulations promulgated by the National Bureau of Weights and Measures (see page A220 of the first issue of the "China Economic Yearbook" or page X6 of the 1934 edition of "Shen Bao and the Yearbook"). That is</p>
<p>One market catty equals 0.8119 catties on a Sima scale</p>
<p>Equals 1.1023 pounds on an English and American scale</p>
<p>One Sima catty equals 1.237 catties on a market scale</p>
<p>Equals 1.35768 pounds on an English and American scale</p>
<p>One English and American pound equals 0.9072 catties on a market scale</p>
<p>(Note) ★ The editor calculated according to the following formula: 1.1023 ÷ 8119 = 1.35768</p>
<p>The market price on October 26 mentioned in the previous issue of this publication. The price of US cotton was 8.61 cents per pound, and the exchange rate of US dollar in Shanghai was 8.3125 yuan of national currency per 100 US dollars (that is, 12 yuan and 3 fen of national currency per 1 US dollar).</p>
<p>If calculated according to the above ratio, whether it is directly converting US cotton to market dan; or converting to Sima dan first and then converting to market dan; or converting to market dan first and then converting to Sima dan; the results are exactly the same, and the difference is at most a few fen or a few hao of the mantissa. The editor's calculations in the previous issue are recorded below, and supplemented with other conversion results for mutual comparison</p>
<p>(A) Legal tender for one market dan directly converted from US cotton (see the examples given by the editor in the previous two issues)</p>
<p>(B) The market dan price obtained from formula A is converted to the Sima dan legal tender price (see the examples given by the editor in the previous two issues)</p>
<p>(C) The legal tender price of Sima dan directly converted from US cotton, whether converted from pounds or converted from pounds, is the same as that obtained in formula B.</p>
<p>This formula converts pounds to Sima; if pounds are discounted to Sima at 861, the result will also be the same. The difference in the mantissa is due to the amount of decimal places used.</p>
<p>(D) The legal tender price of market dan is converted from the Sima scale price again. The results of the conversion in both formulas are of course the same.</p>
<p>That is, each market dan is worth 114.176 yuan of national currency; the difference with formula A is 6 li in the mantissa, and the reason is the same as above. This is obtained by converting from Sima. If the market dan is converted to Sima dan, the result is of course the same, only the mantissa is different.</p>
<p>However, in addition to the above conversion rate, it is now known that the market rate commonly used in the market is different. That is</p>
<p>Equals 1.1023 pounds on an English and American scale</p>
<p>One Sima catty equals 1.20958 catties on a market scale</p>
<p>Equals 1.333 1/3 pounds on an English and American scale</p>
<p>One English and American pound equals 0.907 catties on a market scale</p>
<p>The calculation by Mr. Hu in the previous issue used this ratio. As for the calculations made by the Xinwen Bao in the past, if they are different from the results converted according to the official rate, and are also different from the above market rate, then the reason for the difference must be the different exchange rates used by each other. Because the market conditions on the black market for foreign exchange today change several times a day; the exchange rate on which it is based is inconsistent, and it is appropriate to have special and huge differences. Now, according to this market rate, the comparison of conversion based on the same market conditions is as follows:</p>
<p>(E) The legal tender price of Sima dan directly converted from US cotton (When Mr. Hu gave the example in the previous issue, he did not calculate the mantissa of the conversion rate, so there were slight differences. The exchange rate was wrong. The following is the corrected number)</p>
<p>This differs from the results of the above two formulas B and D by 2 yuan, 5 jiao, 2 fen, and 8 li. This is a matter of course under different conversion rates. However, it is not necessarily the case. Because when this answer is converted to market scale again, there is almost no difference from the conversion results of the above two formulas A and D, as in the following formula.</p>
<p>(F) The legal tender price of market dan converted from Sima 0.82675 according to the market rate from the answer in E is the same as the results of the two formulas A and D.</p>
<p>(G) The legal tender price of one twist of market scale directly converted from US cotton, because the ratio used for the pound scale in one market scale is the same as 110.23 pounds, so it is the same as the previous formula A, and the answer is all 114.1736 yuan; so it is not recorded again.</p>
<p>(H) The market rate of G-formula answer is 120.958, the legal tender price of Sima twist is 120.958, which is the same as the formula F.</p>
<p>Similarities and Differences in Results of Different Ratios</p>
<p>Although there are two fixed numbers for the conversion rate between Sima and market scales, the official and the market; the results should never be consistent in theory, but now that the pound scale has been brought together from it, they have converged from different paths. That is</p>
<p>(1) The national currency price of market scales directly or indirectly synthesized from US cotton according to the official rate (ie, the two formulas A and D) is the same as the national currency price of market scales directly or indirectly synthesized from US cotton according to the market rate (ie, the two formulas F and G), although the conversion rates are different, the results are the same.</p>
<p>(2) The US cotton price of Sima dan directly or indirectly synthesized from US cotton according to the official rate (ie, the two formulas B and C) is larger than that obtained by calculation according to the market rate (ie, the two formulas E and H). In other words, the Sima scale US cotton price obtained by direct or indirect calculation according to the market rate is smaller than that calculated by the official rate.</p>
<p>In short, when measured by Sima scale, the results are different due to different ratios. When measured by market scale, although the ratios are different, the results are almost the same.</p>
<p>The results are different B·D and E·H (that is, when measured by Sima scale)</p>
<p>The results are the same A·D and F·G (that is, when measured by market scale)</p>
<p>The editor lives a scholarly life and has almost no market experience. When Mr. Zhang Fangren raised the question, he only came up with a formula for separately converting the quantity value in principle. Because it was inconsistent with the calculation of the Xinwen Bao, he suspected that there might be errors in the self-proposed formula, so he consulted Mr. Nie Guangdi, manager of the China Cotton Industry Company. Mr. Nie is one of the few cotton industry experts in China. He reviewed and confirmed that the formula was correct, but said "it is not commonly used in the market." He introduced Mr. Hu to write a reply. Mr. Hu once worked in the China Cotton Industry and is currently employed in a foreign company. The insider's words are of course foolproof. Only because the unit is Sima scale, it is jokingly converted to market scale, and at first it was not expected that there would be different conversion rates between market scale and Sima scale. After visiting Mr. Guangdi again, the truth about the different conversion rates came to light. At the same time, he was also given answers and various reference materials by more than ten gentlemen, including Zhang Fangren of Hengyuantai, Wu Fusan of Yingzhou Dyeing and Weaving, Wei Yaoda of Wei Xingji, Zhao Jin of Shenghua Flower Shop, Fengshui of Chengxinchang, and Xu Jijie, Mao Zhenlin, etc.; or using the official rate, or using the market rate, which were quite inconsistent; so he suddenly felt the interest in further research. And he thought that it would be safer to use the market scale in the future. The purpose of this article is to describe the process of this question, and to express my gratitude to all the gentlemen who have jointly studied it; on the other hand, it also has the intention of throwing a brick to attract jade.</p>

<p>Spot Gold: Yesterday's dark market for spot gold saw no trading in the market due to the weekly holiday, and it was heard that there were no transactions outside the market either. However, people were still confused, and buyers were all waiting and seeing. Therefore, the selling price was only around 3,500 yuan, which was still stable compared to Saturday. If the exchange rate stabilizes slightly, the buying trend will definitely rise again, and the gold price may have a chance to turn around.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold: The exchange rate for gold jewelry in jewelry stores remained firm and unchanged. Datonghang and Xintonghang were still quoting 355 yuan, and the purchase price had to be reduced by 20 to 15 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold: According to the London telegram on the 4th, the price of English pure gold was still 8 pounds and 8 shillings per ounce.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Grain New early rice arrives, price drops by about one dollar, common rice also unstable <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Common Rice: In recent days, merchants from north of the Yangtze River have hoarded goods, asking for exorbitant prices due to the scarcity of goods. Generally, the market has been uniquely brisk. Most merchants have turned their attention to the special grade Jingwu rice. Yesterday was a Sunday, and banks and warehouses were closed, so there were not many samples available. This led to a sudden drop in the market for Jingwu special grade rice. Besides local shops buying up a lot of it, even merchants from inland provinces were inquiring about the second grade rice. Therefore, during the bustling trade, merchants' shouting prices increased, but many hoarders took the opportunity to sell, and at the same time, there were also many buyers, making the market even more chaotic than before. As for the closing prices, because there were plenty of goods arriving daily, although most of them were stored in the Hongkou district, there was a possibility of drastic changes if large quantities were dumped on the market.</p>
<p>New Early Rice: Yesterday, Kiln Tea, Bagger, and other varieties arrived, with over 3,000 packages of goods from places like Sujiafengqing. However, due to various reasons, local markets dared not buy too much. Most merchants, at this moment, and those who had a lot of goods in hand, did not want to hold onto them, and they all sought to sell quickly, and their selling intentions were loose. This resulted in a weak market. Until the afternoon closing, the market fell more and more sharply, dropping by six or seven dimes to about one dollar. The price of Lu Yang special grade rice and Bian Yuan rice also weakened, falling by half a dollar along with the early rice market. There was no market for damaged or missing goods. Fragrant rice opened at thirty-seven dollars.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight recovery after several days of decline. The association's quoted price for No. 24 coarse white sugar spot goods rose by fifty cents to fifty dollars. Taikoo crystal white West Warehouse B mark was quoted at fifty-four and a half dollars, East Warehouse at fifty-three and a half dollars, with 100 bags traded. Dutch red sugar was forty-one and a half dollars, up fifty cents. Domestic sugar was also very weak, and red sand was even less sold, so the ordinary goods of Dongxiang red sugar only opened at thirty-four dollars, with 80 bags traded.</p>

<p>This year's southern gorgon fruit harvest was very poor, and there was not much stock, so the price rose again. High-quality goods sold for up to two hundred and forty dollars, determined at one hundred and twenty dollars. Local gorgon fruit was also driven high, and screened clean sold for one hundred dollars, second grade for ninety-five or ninety-six dollars. There were transactions in this street and by the Xinghua merchants.</p>

<p>The coal brick business has been brisk recently due to the cold weather. However, due to the extreme shortage of raw material Wenzhou coal dust and the high cost of labor, most factories have stopped work, resulting in demand exceeding supply in the market, and demolition prices soaring. Large size coal bricks are already quoted at two hundred and sixty dollars, and there is no pure cyan. Retail in front of the gate, large size coal is out of stock, one hundred for three dollars, second size two dollars and fifty cents.</p>

<h3 id="e62">Sexual Health: Kidney Deficiency and Weakness in Men and Women <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>The reason why men's bodies become deficient and weak is mostly due to debauchery, but excessive labor, congenital deficiencies, and acquired malnutrition, which lead to a decrease in metabolic power, are also one of the biggest reasons.</p>
<p>As for women, the main reasons for being pale and anemic, premature aging, and kidney deficiency are mostly due to excessive housework or frequent childbirth.</p>
<p>After our physical strength is depleted, the first thing we feel is fatigue. The reason is that the vitality in the body is reduced, and cells die as a result. On the one hand, excessive labor results in more cell death, because labor is directly proportional to cell death. The more labor, the more corpses of cells accumulate. These corpses of cells are the only cause of fatigue.</p>
<p>Although sleep is said to be an excellent opportunity for rehabilitation, physical deficiency will inevitably lead to neurasthenia and often insomnia. Moreover, people who are under the pressure of life are constantly using their brains. Being able to save their brainpower is a way of preserving life. And born in today's complex society, men are busy making a living, and women mostly preside over family affairs, and many are burdened by their children, so it is not easy to improve their health. Therefore, the only way is to ingest the ingredients in animals, plants, and minerals that are beneficial to the human body to increase essence and replenish blood, and promote the function of metabolism. Therefore, choosing a tonic becomes an important issue. Moreover, there are many types of tonics on the market, and very few meet the ideals of scientists and our doctors. Therefore, both doctors and patients suffer from it, but according to my many years of experience, the problem is known. Moreover, there are many types of tonics on the market. Recently, the German "Körperkonzentrat (Body Concentrate)," a medicine praised by scholars from various countries, is extracted from the testicles and ovarian endocrine of strong animals, and also incorporates brain-nourishing phosphorus and other essential nutrients for the human body, so its tonic power reaches omnipotence. It can not only make the blood full, the mind clear, and the weight increase, but also has a 100% curative effect for treating those who are injured by self-mutilation or caused by debauchery. It is guaranteed to be effective for those who suffer from premature ejaculation, impotence, kidney deficiency, and infertility. Elderly people who take it can refresh their spirits and increase their appetite. The female "Körperkonzentrat" can treat irregular menstruation, anemia, premature aging and other symptoms. As for men with frequent spermatorrhea, in addition to taking "Körperkonzentrat," they should also take "Ners Spermatorrhea Tablets" to stop it immediately.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Flower-Willows Disease: Destroy the Nest of Gonococci <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Yue Wumu of the Song Dynasty had a very heroic saying, "Attack Huanglong directly." Huanglong was the base of the Jin Kingdom, and eliminating it was the fundamental solution. Unfortunately, it failed, which is a pity for thousands of years. This shows that to be successful, one must solve the root of the problem. As far as gonorrhea is concerned, gonorrhea patients often temporarily conceal the disease and do not pay attention to it at all. All actions are no different from when they were not ill. As a result, it recurs from time to time, and the disease gets worse and worse until it is beyond repair. Therefore, those who are good at treating gonorrhea must be good at treating the root cause, and the root cause of gonorrhea must be eradicated. All recurring diseases must have their roots not removed, and this is indeed the case for gonorrhea that recurs again and again. Therefore, I believe that it is not difficult to make gonorrhea temporarily hidden on the surface. The difficulty lies in how to directly attack the nest of pathogens. Fortunately, science now has a high rate of development, and a safe solution has indeed been found for such difficult problems. It turns out that Dr. Peter, the master of German gonorrhea, has spent more than 30 years inventing the "Klinon," a mixed preparation of proteome yellow pigment. This agent has been proven effective by famous doctors around the world over the years. Its efficacy exceeds all ordinary chemical therapies, because this agent also refers to the principle of non-specific therapy and has been continuously improved. Its efficacy can produce anti-gonococcal phagocytosis within a few hours after taking it. Whether it is early gonorrhea or chronic gonorrhea, it can be quickly cured. This is because although gonococci have a strong ability to reproduce and many places to escape, they are ultimately no match for the efficacy of "Klinon," which can directly destroy the gonococcal nest, like a dragnet, and it is difficult to escape the net. Therefore, gonorrhea that has been cured by "Klinon" has never recurred, and there has never been a failure. As for external medicine, men can use "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" externally to wash the urethra according to the diagram and instructions. Women can use "Karsedil Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories. Insert one piece every night before going to bed, and wash it off in the morning, and its efficacy will be complete and rapid.</p>
<h3 id="e64">The Severity of Coughing <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Coughing is the easiest symptom to be ignored, because cough patients do not have any dangerous symptoms at the time, so it has been delayed, and the cough becomes more and more severe, taming to the point where it cannot be saved.</p>
<p>From a true pathological point of view, coughing is a manifestation of the lungs eliminating foreign invaders and is a kind of resistance against insults. Using anesthetics instead reduces resistance. According to my more than 20 years of experience and reference to the reports of experiments by doctors in various countries, the lung disease special medicine "Pulmonal" invented by Dr. Tume of Germany is the most effective. No matter how stubborn and difficult to cure or cough that is about to become tuberculosis, taking "Pulmonal" can achieve the effect of relieving cough and resolving phlegm within three hours, and nourishing the lungs and preventing tuberculosis, its function is far above cod liver oil, which has been proven by doctors from various countries.</p>

<p>Effective treatment for nocturnal emission</p>
<p>Patient Shi Rongxi, 19 years old, from Hangzhou, (self-reported) - I am physically weak and currently studying at a middle school on Beijing Road. I am very interested in my usual homework and have no bad habits. I have never committed masturbation. Unexpectedly, nocturnal emission suddenly occurred three months ago. Every time I slept, the sperm would naturally come out. I was very anxious and asked the doctor for treatment. According to him, it was caused by physical weakness and told me to pay attention to health, get up early and go to bed early, pay attention to urination before going to bed, and rub the local area with cold water, and do not eat stimulants such as tobacco and alcohol. I followed his instructions, and within a few days, nocturnal emission did not occur. A month later, due to the school's big exam, my homework was extremely busy. Unexpectedly, nocturnal emission recurred that night, and the next morning I was listless, dizzy, and backache. It has been half a month now, and nocturnal emission continues to occur. I have specially written a letter to ask the doctors for treatment (treatment process) - Let him follow the previous health regimen, and let him take "Ners Spermatorrhea Tablets" and male "Körperkonzentrat," a preparation of testicular essence from strong animals, before going to bed every day. Mr. Shi took it for a month, and the nocturnal emission has been radically cured, and his body is strong and his weight has also increased by ten pounds.</p>

<p>Written by Dr. Yao Juyan Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>In this late autumn season, it is the time when chrysanthemums are thin and crabs are fat. At this time, the gutless young master is indeed an excellent wine appetizer for old men. It is also a great scenery for elegant people to hold crabs while appreciating chrysanthemums and writing poems in time for pleasure. It is unavoidable that in many places, there are often opportunities for old diseases to recur. Although this is different from the meaning of diseases entering through the mouth, it is indeed increasing things that cause old diseases. Everyone thinks that the flavor of crabs is meaningful. However, people with gonorrhea often have a recurrence of old diseases after eating crabs. The reason why these viruses recur is not really that eating crabs causes gonorrhea, but that after eating crabs and wine, they stimulate latent gonococci. As a result, many people think that gonorrhea is already cured, so why does gonorrhea suddenly occur? Some wives even think that their wives are unfaithful, which is a wrongful thing. But they don't know that the gonorrhea at this time is old. At this time, the gonococci are just taking the opportunity to erupt. Experienced doctors say that the recurrence of old gonorrhea in late autumn is mostly caused by eating crabs and wine. So, can't people with gonorrhea eat crabs? I think it's best not to eat them temporarily until they are cured. If you want to eat crabs, you must cure the gonorrhea first before you can eat them as you please. To treat old gonorrhea, you must use the special gonorrhea medicine "Klinon" to make its bactericidal power reach the lesion directly, and use German electrostatic therapy and anti-gonorrhea serum to completely collect and eradicate all gonococci in the blood or local areas and other places. Then, you can feast on the gutless young master without any recurrence. The disease that recurs must have its roots. Once the roots are gone, the branches and leaves will have no way to grow. Gonorrhea that recurs due to crabs should be treated in time. Consultation hours: 10 am to 6 pm Starting from today, 20 diagnosis numbers will be sent out every day, each number will only take 5 cents and will also give a full book on sexually transmitted diseases</p>

<h3 id="e67">The Country Mourns the Virtuous; the People Lose Their Mentor: Ma Xiangbo Dies in Liangshan; All Circles in Shanghai Are Deeply Shocked; A Petition to the National Government to Commend and Hold a State Funeral <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Old Mr. Ma Xiangbo, a centenarian, had been living in Liangshan, on the border between Guangxi and Vietnam, since he moved there from Fengdong Mountain in Guilin on November 20th of last year. Suddenly, the news of his death came last night (the 4th), shocking everyone. It was learned that the old man had passed away at his residence in Liangshan, Vietnam. Han Jingqi, the secretary-general of Aurora University in Shanghai and the Danyang Shanghai Native Association, was the first to receive a telegram from Mr. Ma's family that evening, the original telegram said, "Old Mr. Xiang died on the 4th at 3 pm, Ma Zhi." Both places have already notified Mr. Ma's relatives and friends in Shanghai yesterday. Mr. Ma's son passed away early, and those who accompanied Mr. Ma were his daughter-in-law Ma Qiu Yiwu, his granddaughter Ma Yuzhang, and his grandson-in-law Xie Wenhui. His daughter, Ms. Shi Xu, has two nephews, the elder named Jinghua, born in Beiping, and named Roma, born in Italy. They all put on mourning clothes in Liangshan yesterday. The whole country and the public mourned together, because Mr. Ma was old and virtuous, and had contributed greatly to supporting the war of resistance. It was a great loss to the country. March 19th of this year (February 17th of the lunar calendar) was Mr. Ma's 101st birthday, and the whole country celebrated. Mr. Ma did not want to disturb friends at home and abroad during the national crisis, so he allocated the birthday celebration funds to disaster relief expenses. Mr. Ma's patriotic feelings have always been extremely enthusiastic. Since the rise of the Chinese army, Mr. Ma has always been optimistic, believing that the final victory must belong to us. Yesterday afternoon, the reporter visited the old man's great-grandson, the sculptor Zhang Chongren, to inquire about the details of the old man's move from Beijing to Guilin before the war of resistance, as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e68">Chongqing Mourns <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Our newspaper's Chongqing telegram of the 5th stated that the centenarian Mr. Ma Xiangbo, who was convalescing in Liangshan, had been reported to be unwell a few days ago. All parties here were very concerned about his health. However, today the Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from the Consul General in Hanoi, reporting that the old man had passed away in Liangshan on the morning of the 4th at 6 o'clock. All circles in Chongqing were deeply saddened by the news.</p>
<p>Supporting the Government: Responding to the Invitation to Go to Beijing Before August 13th, Mr. Ma lived in Tushanwan, Xujiahui. Later, due to the government's letters and telegrams, the old man was asked to leave Shanghai and go to Beijing. At that time, Bishop Yu Bin was promoted to the Nanjing District Bishopric and sent a telegram to welcome him. Therefore, Mr. Ma's close aides and family members decided to accompany the old man to Beijing. The authorities were very pleased to learn of Mr. Ma's trip to Beijing, and many disciples such as Yu Youren and Shao Lizi asked Mr. Ma to stay in Beijing for a long time so that they could seek advice and guidance at any time. Mr. Ma immediately agreed to show his support for the government. At that time, Mr. Ma's great-grandson Zhang Chongren returned to China after completing his studies, and he and Mr. Ma's weak daughter-in-law and granddaughter accompanied him to Beijing, serving him all day long. All foreign affairs were also represented by Mr. Zhang. Two months before August 13th, Mr. Zhang came to Shanghai for something, but he did not know that the war had broken out and traffic was interrupted. Mr. Zhang could not leave. Therefore, when the old man left Beijing for Guilin in November, in addition to the two daughters-in-law and granddaughter who served him, no one took care of all other affairs. Fortunately, Vice Chairman Feng Yuxiang had made arrangements in advance, so it was not very difficult.</p>
<p>The Outbreak of the War: Moving to Guilin</p>
<p>The old man and his family arrived safely in Guilin on November 25th and immediately sent three letters to Mr. Zhang (all letters were written by the daughter-in-law because the old man could not hold a pen). They reported the situation of leaving Beijing and arriving in Guilin. One of them said, "This time, we were able to escape safely thanks to the help of Duke Feng (referring to Feng Yuxiang), who contacted Guangxi Province in advance and assigned two officials to escort us directly to Hengyang. Guilin also sent special officials to wait for us. All expenses along the way were paid by both parties. When we arrived in Guilin Province, all circles welcomed us outside the suburbs. When we arrived at our private residence, all the necessary miscellaneous items were ready. Many preferential treatments were received. I am very grateful and must thank the Creator for the wonderful arrangement." The second said, "We arrived safely in Guilin on the morning of the 25th. Chairman Huang has arranged all the houses, etc. However, we feel very inconvenient because we cannot communicate in the language (omitted below)." They lived in Defeng Building on Fengdong Mountain in Guilin. The corner of the small building has beautiful scenery, which is more suitable for the elderly to live in. Next to the building is a stele of Qu Shisi, a loyal minister of the Ming Dynasty, who was guarding Guilin and died. His loyalty and righteousness are enough to illuminate the ages, similar to the current stage situation. It has historical significance, so the elderly are very happy to live here. When they are in good spirits, they often stroke the stele and sigh for a long time, using it to vent their accumulated frustrations in their hearts.</p>
<p>Living in Fengdong Mountain for More Than a Year Living in Fengdong Mountain for more than a year, finally, the weather was too cold and there was a lack of supplies. The food used by the elderly was purchased from Hong Kong, and all kinds of western medicines were purchased by Mr. Zhang in Shanghai and sent to Guilin. The old man usually used no more than the following four kinds of western medicine: one, Antu Cibaoming medicated water, two, cod liver oil pills, three, Le Panglandire, and four, embryo extract. Before moving to Liangshan, the family had a letter to Mr. Zhang, consulting with each other, roughly saying, "Grandpa has diarrhea, his energy is depleted, and his life is like a candle in the wind, which may happen unexpectedly, making people anxious and uneasy day and night. In addition, the climate here has not been good recently, and I am deeply afraid that the epidemic will be approaching from afar (referring to the war), which is inconvenient for Grandpa to start, so I want to avoid it first. All procedures are being prepared, but it depends on how Grandpa's energy is and whether the epidemic spreads everywhere. If it is a great luck, there is no need to make the elderly travel a long distance (omitted in the middle). As for our move, we are going to move to Liangshan in Annam, because the climate there is hot, which is suitable for the elderly to spend the winter. Our departure is undecided, and we will notify you often at that time. Half a month ago, there were many autumn insects in Guilin (referring to Japanese aircraft), and the buzzing sound was very annoying, but it did not harm people, so don't worry about it (omitted in the middle). I am working for the epidemic, for Grandpa, and for repairing luggage, and thinking about the future. I don't know how to end it. It is really the so-called vast universe, where will I return? Although the world is big, there is no place for me."</p>
<p>Persuaded by All Parties: Finally Went to Liangshan</p>
<p>After the idea of ​​moving to Liangshan arose, the old man was consulted for his consent. Unexpectedly, he strongly opposed it, thinking that if he wanted to move, he should go to Kunming, so that he would not leave the country. The old man was the first of our country's students studying abroad, and he knew a lot about history and geography. Now, although he is old, he knows that although Liangshan is still under our Guangxi, it has entered the territory of Annam, so he does not want his footprints to set foot in a foreign land. Although the family coaxed him with "Liangshan is still our country", the old man's opposition remained the same. Finally, the family advised him that the weather in Kunming was humid and it was not suitable to live there for a long time. It would be better to live in Liangshan temporarily and wait until the winter to spring (ie, this spring) before moving to Kunming. The old man finally agreed. After Zhang in Shanghai received the news of the decision to move to Liangshan, he sent his cousin from Shanghai to Guilin to help with the arrangements and maintenance along the way.</p>
<p>Traveling along the way: Quite Tiring</p>
<p>Mr. Ma and his party set off from Fengdong Mountain on November 15th of last year and arrived safely in Liangshan on the 20th. Because the road was rugged, they suffered a lot of bumps. When they arrived in Nanning, his grandson-in-law Xie Wenhui bought a bottle of sleeping pills, and the whole family swallowed them before arriving at their destination unknowingly. After arriving in Liangshan, a letter was received in Shanghai, saying, "It took five days to travel from Guilin to Liang, and there were more than 30 vomits in total. When we arrived in Nanning, Wenhui (grandson-in-law of Old Mr. Xiang) bought a bottle of sleeping pills, so from Nanning to Longzhou, and from Longzhou to Liangshan, we were all asleep. This section is particularly good. Fortunately, traffic will be convenient in the future, and it will not be difficult for you to come here for a tour. But to be honest, the mountains and rivers are beautiful, and everywhere is a "copy"" It is heard that Mr. Zhang is recently preparing to go to Liang to pay his respects. He has not seen the bad news for two years, and he is overwhelmed with grief. The aging Mr. Xiang did not expect that when people first arrived in Liangshan, they were in good spirits. Whenever the weather was clear, they often took a small car to tour the neighborhood, or supported a cane for a short rest, because they were still able to walk at that time. This autumn, they have not been able to walk, and their liver fire has also become strong. They lie alone in a room every day, and they must browse all the domestic newspapers. They are very concerned about national affairs, so they often slam the bed and slap the table. Because of this, their family no longer sends newspapers to the elderly, but they often ask about the details of people who come to visit, and they will not allow visitors to leave until they have been answered clearly, so the family is very worried about this, and their only hope is that the elderly can personally see the final victory belonging to our country, restore the previous territory, and their wishes will be fulfilled. They initially did not want their ambition to be unfulfilled and suddenly return to Daoshan. Alas, it hurts,</p>
<p>The Victory in Northern Hunan: Great Comfort to Hear the News</p>
<p>When the news of the victory of the Chinese army in northern Hunan came, Mr. Ma was unusually happy. Only because his physical strength was declining day by day, he once told his family that the final victory was getting closer and closer, but he was afraid that his body would not be able to support it and he would not be able to see the triumphant return of the Chinese army. Unexpectedly, he died of illness for a long time and died for the country with worry. As for Mr. Ma's will, it will be announced in Liangshan,</p>
<p>Business Circles Cable: To Hold a State Funeral</p>
<p>After Shanghai all circles were shocked to hear the bad news, the Danyang Zhenjiang and other fellow country associations and various public groups and all circles initiated a memorial service, the address is still under negotiation, Shanghai gentlemen Yu Qiaqing, Lin Kanghou, and Mr. Ma's old friend Yang Caoxian, etc., decided to unite the leaders of all circles to cable the National Government to commend and hold a state funeral, to show the state's remembrance of the elders,</p>

<p>President's Birthday Memorial: Soliciting Cold Pages</p>
<p>Donations sent to various relief agencies, old clothes and bedding are also welcome to donate</p>
<p>On the 12th of November, the anniversary of the birth of the President, various charitable organizations in this city have determined to be the day for Shanghai to raise cold clothes for the refugees to provide relief, due to the advent of the cold winter and the lack of clothes and bedding for the refugees. The third floor of the YMCA of the Eight Immortals Bridge, the Shanghai International Relief Association, the Citizens Group of the Refugee Association in Xingye Building, Jiangxi Road, and the Shanghai United Relief Association of the Ermalu Yu'e Fang all receive donations of cold clothes and funds. It is heard that the fundraising committees of various groups of the association will welcome and accept donations of old clothes and bedding or clothes, pants, shoes, etc. for men, women, children and children (suitable for winter use) to the refugees from all walks of life.</p>

<p>The Japanese army used to station a Japanese soldier next to the "Fish Market" at the Public Pier on Yangshupu Road to guard the post. Now, it has suddenly moved the guardhouse to Andong Road Pier, and added another Japanese soldier, and ordered all civilian ships to dock at Andong Road Pier. It is heard that the reason is that setting up a post at Andong Road Pier is easier to inspect than the Public Pier, so that passengers disembarking from civilian ships cannot steal over the Japanese army's post, and the "Fish Market" has recently posted a notice, the content of which is that any fish vendors who have not registered in the market and operate in the market will be subject to severe penalties once found, and the conditions for the market to register Chinese brokers are extremely harsh, so the general fish vendors feel very painful.</p>

<p>In the eastern Zhejiang region, due to the Japanese warships shelling Longshan, Lishui being heavily bombed by Japanese planes, and Japanese warships appearing in the waters outside Zhenhai Port, the situation suddenly became tense. The Ningbo Defense Headquarters specifically ordered the garrisons along the Ningbo coast and the Zhenhai Fortress to be on alert. According to a report from the Datong News Agency reporter inquiring with the shipping industry, Japanese warships in the Zhejiang sea had successively sailed away yesterday. The tense atmosphere of the past few days has eased. However, the garrison's vigilance has not relaxed in the slightest.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Since the Start of the War of Resistance: Total Donations in Shanghai Exceed 20 Million Yuan, This is the Minimum Responsibility That Should Be Fulfilled <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, all sectors of Shanghai have united in hatred against the enemy and generously donated funds. From the Lugouqiao Incident until today, in these two years and four months, it is estimated that the total amount of patriotic and charitable donations from the people of Shanghai has exceeded 20 million yuan. This includes the purchase of national salvation bonds, and the donation of a large number of transportation vehicles, defense materials, and therapeutic drugs during the early stages of the Battle of Shanghai. Subsequently, there were various gold offerings and winter clothing donations. Because Shanghai has special concession areas, it has become a haven for evading war. In the past two years, Shanghai has evacuated more than a million refugees. More than twenty charities accommodated as many as 300,000 refugees at the most. The payment of this huge amount of relief funds, in addition to the central relief committee and aid from European and American friendly countries, the generosity of the people of Shanghai is also considerable. To this day, the spirit of all sectors in donating money and helping those in need has not slackened. Recently, such as donations for winter clothing and donations for the Hebei flood, have each reached more than 200,000 yuan in no time. This is truly in line with the loyal and courageous spirit of the soldiers on the front line of the Second War of Resistance, who are fighting harder and becoming stronger. The people of Shanghai deeply understand that the soldiers are fighting bloody battles for the country and the nation, and the displaced people are suffering for the country and the nation. It is our minimum responsibility to save what we can to help them.</p>
<h3 id="e72">The Life of Mr. Ma Xiangbo <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>The news of Mr. Ma Xiangbo's death in Liangshan has shocked all circles in Shanghai. Mr. Ma's contributions to the country through education and writing are immeasurable. His students are all over the country. Therefore, I will briefly describe the life of Mr. Ma. On this day when the country has lost an elder statesman, it can also serve as a model for young people.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma's given name was Liang, and his courtesy name was Xiangbo. He was born in Danyang County, Jiangsu Province, in 1839. His family was Catholic. His father, Mr. Songyan, taught as a commoner, and his mother was Madam Shen. Sixty-five years before the founding of the Republic of China, when he was nine years old, he entered a private school. He finished reading the Five Classics at the age of eleven. At the age of twelve, he studied at Xuhui Public School. During the Taiping Rebellion, Mr. Ma went to Suzhou, Taicang and other places to help refugees. At the age of twenty, he was ordained as a priest by the Roman Curia. At the age of twenty-four, he translated "A Comprehensive Collection of Mathematics and Physics." At the age of thirty-one, he preached in Xuzhou. At the age of thirty-three, he suffered the loss of his father. At the age of thirty-six, he joined the staff of Li Wenzhong in Hefei. At the age of forty-three, the Qing government sent Mr. Ma to the United States to borrow 50 million yuan to prepare for self-made armaments, but it failed due to the ignorance of the powerful. At the age of forty-five, he was ordered to go to Korea. At the age of forty-seven, he went to France to investigate commerce. At the age of fifty-three, he served as the consul in Nagasaki. At the age of fifty-six, he suffered the loss of his mother. At the age of sixty-four, he invested in the establishment of Aurora University. Ma Junwu, Zhang Yichou, and Shao Lizi all came from his school. At that time, Yu Youren wrote a poem satirizing the current political situation, and was hunted down by the Qing government. He came to Shanghai to take refuge, and Mr. Ma recruited him into the school. At the age of sixty-six, he established the financial foundation for Fudan Public School. At the age of sixty-seven, he was ordered to go to Tokyo to handle matters for overseas students. At the age of seventy, he became the head of Fudan Public School. At the age of seventy-three, the Republic of China was founded, and Mr. Ma stayed in Nanjing. At the age of seventy-one, he served as the president of Peking University, and also as a senator in the Senate. When the imperial system was proposed, Mr. Ma wrote to Yuan Shikai to argue strongly against it, and finally resigned and went south. At the age of seventy-four, he wrote "A New History: A Straight Talk." At the age of seventy-eight, he moved to Tushanwan in Xujiahui, Shanghai. At the age of seventy-nine, he wrote "A Mirror for the Hearts of the People." At the age of eighty-seven, Mr. Ma wrote the first volume of "A Simple Explanation of Reaching Knowledge," starting with "The Origin of Words," which was published by Commercial Press. At the age of eighty-eight, he wrote "A Small History of the Spiritual Heart." At the age of ninety, when the national government established its capital in Nanjing, Mr. Ma continued to write "A Simple Explanation of Reaching Knowledge" and retranslated the Four Gospels. At the age of ninety-five, he wrote "Xu Wending Gong and Chinese Science." At the age of ninety-six, he wrote "The Biography of Saint Tong Baosi Gao."</p>
<p>In December of the twenty-third year, when Feng Yuxiang was in Tai'an, he had several half-length portraits of Ma embroidered by a silk weaving factory. Feng personally inscribed the four characters "Great Elder of the Nation" and sent letters to all sectors, saying that since the September 18th Incident, Mr. Ma had been grieving over the fragmentation of the country, often weeping and singing with emotion. Therefore, he made embroidered portraits to express his admiration and sent Ma's portraits to friends. On December 12th of that year, when Mr. Ma was ninety-seven years old, he accepted the invitation of the central government and took a special train to Nanjing, residing at No. 12 Dafang Lane, Gulou. He read the "Book of Han" and the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." At the same time, the national government issued a decree to commend Ma for donating hundreds of thousands of yuan to establish Aurora University in Shanghai. On the 14th, the 33rd regular meeting of the Central Committee elected Ma as a member of the National Government. On August 12th of the twenty-sixth year, Ma accepted the invitation of the Central Broadcasting Station to give a lecture on "Steel Policy," saying that it is not easy for a country to become rich before it becomes strong. Confucius said that sufficient food and sufficient troops mean that wealth and strength are equally important. Please everyone quickly start smelting steel and iron to strengthen China. In the autumn of that year, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Ma telegraphed the Dahe Hospital, which he founded, to set up a wounded soldier's hospital before the outbreak of the war, and then left Beijing for Hankou in early November. On the 26th, he arrived in Quanzhou from Hengyang and transferred to Diecai Mountain in Guilin. Ma's residence was the place where Changshu Qu Zhongyi and Jiangling Zhang Zhonglie became martyrs. Later, the area was frequently bombed, and he moved to Liangshan. In March of the twenty-eighth year, Ma celebrated his 100th birthday, and grand celebrations were held throughout the country. The National Government issued a decree on April 5th, stating that he had reached the age of one hundred and his feelings were still as bold as ever, and his spirit was undiminished from his younger years. He was not only a national hero, but also an auspicious sign for the country. A decree was issued to commend him specially. On April 11th, news reporters visited Ma in Liangshan, and Ma said with great emotion, "I am a dog, I can only bark, and I have been barking for a hundred years, and I have not yet awakened China." In the same year, Ma sent letters to all parts of the country, thanking him for his birthday, saying that if you can understand my humble intentions, and let the old man see the rejuvenation of China, and the whole world ascends to longevity together, then the old man's hundred years of life will not be in vain. At the same time, important members of the Central Committee publicly initiated a celebration for his 100th birthday and raised funds to help wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>Mr. Ma's scholarship was profound and his writings were numerous. Even in his later years, after eighty, he still diligently studied calligraphy and painting. His spirit of learning was stronger as he got older. When the old man was ninety-seven years old, old friends hosted a banquet for him in a restaurant. Halfway through the banquet, a soup was served, and it was later learned that it cost three hundred gold. Mr. Ma heard this and could hardly swallow the soup. Afterwards, Ma talked to people about this matter and was always angry! When Mr. Ma was invited to Beijing by the national government, the authorities specially prepared a rattan chair for him and welcomed him at the station. This was a special case, except for Mr. Zhang Renjie of the Central Committee, who was unwell. When he was in Beijing, he got up at five o'clock in the morning and had breakfast at nine o'clock, and took a bath in the afternoon. His life was very strict. His daily food included five eggs and a bowl of chicken broth as the main foods.</p>

The 28 Western detectives all wore plain clothes, plus wire vests. Four red guard vehicles also participated in the inspection. When proceeding, the commander ordered the advance, and the whole body marched neatly, with the Chinese police and mounted police being the best, followed by the Western police, Indian police, and Japanese police.</p>

<p>According to a guest who had just arrived in Shanghai from Hankou, the Japanese were making things difficult for Chinese people who came to Shanghai by ship from the mainland in every possible way. In addition to going through the formalities of applying for a pass and getting vaccinated in Hankou, they also carried out intestinal washing work on board. The guest took the Yiyang Maru to Shanghai, and was forced by the Japanese to wash his intestines as many as eleven times. When the ship arrived at the Wusongkou, he was still forced to wash it once. Although he was able to arrive in Shanghai safely, it was like a major illness. He had to stay in the hospital for recuperation before he could recover his health.</p>

<p>The fuel panic in Shanghai has been resolved. The coal stockpile has increased. A large amount of white coal was shipped from India and Annam yesterday and the day before, and has all been put into storage to await customers. It is estimated that the total stockpile of bituminous coal and white coal in all coal stacks in the city is about 500,000 tons. Recently, coal prices have begun to fall. Now that winter is approaching, the demand for white coal has increased. The industry once held a meeting to discuss uniform selling prices.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Foreign Merchants in Tianjin Have No Place to Stand: Carpet Company Moves to Shanghai Because Japanese Monopoly Makes it Impossible to Obtain Raw Materials, Another Carpet Factory Will Also Move Soon <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily" reported that 85 skilled workers from Tianjin's famous Nichols Carpet Company arrived in Shanghai last night (the 4th) to start working in the company's new factory in Yangshupu. This clearly reflects the commercial situation in Tianjin. Mr. Nichols, the owner of the company, told reporters in this city yesterday that the relocation of the factory to Shanghai has been completed and work can begin in a few days. It was learned from reliable sources last night that foreign expatriates in Tianjin are unable to obtain the necessary raw materials due to the Japanese monopoly. This is one of the main reasons why the Nichols Company moved to Shanghai. In the past, the wool used by the company's carpet factory was supplied by Shandong. In recent months, Tianjin has been unable to obtain Shandong wool, but this raw material can be obtained in this city. According to reports, the Nichols Company has been one of the two major American carpet manufacturers in Tianjin for many years. It is heard that another carpet company also intends to move to Shanghai soon.</p>

<h3 id="e78">Japanese Army Plans to Return to Former Barracks: Various Countries Decide Not to Allow It: Foreign Losses in This War Are Extremely Heavy, and They Refuse to Return Them Before the End of the War <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese army has recently stationed troops in the Macau Road, Yichang Road, and Loulang Road areas of western Shanghai under the pretext of protecting the lives and property of Japanese expatriates in the concession. They have repeatedly sought to restore the garrison in the Gordon Road barracks, but their attempt failed because the American army did not approve their request. The Japanese army in the American and Italian military defense zones can only be stationed temporarily and has no right to deploy defenses. As for the Toyota yarn factory's Japanese soldier barracks, the Italian army still maintains its garrison, and it is impossible for the Japanese army to restore it. It is heard that the reason is that all countries believe that this war was initiated by the Japanese side, and the losses suffered by expatriates are extremely large. Before the end of the war, it will be difficult to allow the Japanese army to return to the barracks.</p>
<p>American Military Defense Zone Fully Defended</p>
<p>Before the war in Shanghai, the Japanese army garrison in Shanghai had barracks established in the Toyota Yarn Factory, Robertson Road, Neiwaimian No. 13 Factory, and Gordon Road. Since the outbreak of the war, the Japanese troops in these three places have all been withdrawn to the Hongkou headquarters. The property of the Japanese Neiwaimian yarn factories in the American military defense zone has been completely sealed up. The Gordon Road barracks has also been handed over to the American army for garrison. In order to strengthen its defenses, the American army authorities have also specially established the Haifang Road barracks, commanding the garrisons in Xiaoshadu Road, Seymour Road, and four other places. The American army has repeatedly maintained the garrison of the Gordon Road barracks handed over by the Japanese side, without any changes.</p>
<p>Italian Army Restrains Japanese and Puppet Atrocities</p>
<p>The number of Italian defense forces stationed in Shanghai is not too large. One place is stationed opposite the Jiaozhou Park. The defense area is west of Jiaozhou Road to the bottom of Zhaofeng Garden, and Yaoshui Lane on Robertson Road. The assigned guard post is on the side of the No. 13 factory. After the friction between the Japanese army separated by barbed wire and the British army in the Toyota Yarn Factory, it has been changed to Italian military garrison. Caojiadu Wujiaochang also belongs to the Italian military defense zone. The atrocities of the Japanese puppet troops in western Shanghai have been completely restrained and stabilized by the Italian army.</p>

<p>The Tianfeng Machinery Dyeing and Weaving Factory at No. 14, Lane 76, Xiamen Road, in the Public Concession, suddenly caught fire at 2:45 a.m. yesterday. The fire spread rapidly and immediately. The fire brigade was dispatched to the rescue after receiving the news, and the fire was extinguished after a long time. The factory's three-story building and property were all destroyed by the fire. Because the factory owner's family lived upstairs, the housewife and the old accountant were unable to escape and were buried in the fire.</p>

<p>According to the Datong News Agency, since Master Yuan Ying, the chairman of the Chinese Buddhist Association, was taken away by the Japanese on Dashilu Yuanming Lecture Hall on the 19th of last month, his whereabouts have become a mystery. In addition, the Central Relief Commission has telegraphed Shanghai to investigate the situation of his fundraising in Nanyang. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yuan Ying's Whereabouts</p>
<p>Since Master Yuan Ying was taken away on Dashilu, his whereabouts have been said to be still detained in Jiangwan, and some have said that he has been transferred to Hongkou, and some have said that he has been transferred to Nanjing. The rumors are divergent and have become a mystery. However, the Japanese side does not seem to have any political purpose for him, so what is the intention is puzzling.</p>
<p>Central Investigation</p>
<p>When Yuan Ying took refuge in Nanyang, he took the opportunity to raise a large amount of money from overseas Chinese. However, the Central Relief Commission did not receive a penny of this money. After reading the newspaper, the chairman of the commission, Xu Shiying, was deeply shocked. Therefore, he has telegraphed Shanghai to investigate. In addition, the Shanghai Charity Relief Association has not received the money raised by Yuan Ying.</p>

<p>According to the "China Press," it was learned from responsible sources yesterday (the 4th) that personnel from the Shanghai Special "Municipal Government" boarded the Panamanian ship "Bolivar" and arrested a Chinese man, the ship's second mate. As a result, the US Consul-General in this city has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese authorities in Shanghai on behalf of the Panamanian government. At the request of the American official, the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai is currently conducting a thorough investigation. It is reported that this incident occurred on October 28th, when the "Bolivar" was berthed at the New Mitsui Wharf. Suddenly, a team of "Municipal Government Police" accompanied by a Korean advisor boarded the ship and arrested the second mate and the third mate. The third mate was released after being detained for two days, but the second mate is still detained at the "Police Station" on Dongchang Road in Pudong. It is generally believed that the third mate has been released because he holds a British passport. The local management office of the "Bolivar," Hualun Foreign Firm, has reported the matter in detail to the US Consul-General last week and is conducting an investigation. The "Bolivar" was previously purchased from the United States by a certain shipping company of Chinese merchants. When the Sino-Japanese War was about to break out in the middle of last year, the ship once flew the Chinese flag and carried scrap iron to a certain port in Japan to unload. After sailing to Hong Kong, when the war broke out, the Chinese ship owner sold the ship to Hong Kong Hualun Company in August of the previous year. Since then, it has belonged to the property of Hualun Company and flies the Panamanian flag. The rumor that the ship once flew the Norwegian flag is not true.</p>
<p>A representative of Hualun Company's local office told reporters last night that the rumor that the ship belongs to the Bank of Communications is ridiculous. The ship has belonged to Hualun Company for more than two years. The representative also assured us that the "Bolivar" has not been mortgaged to the Bank of Communications. It is heard that the Japanese Navy has nothing to do with boarding the "Bolivar" and detaining the crew members. It was the "Municipal Government Police" who were directed by the Special Affairs Department of the Japanese Army who did this. The Japanese Navy had not heard of it beforehand. As far as the local Hualun Company can confirm, the "Bolivar" has not been "officially" detained. Negotiations for the release of the second mate have been underway last week, but as of late last night, the second mate was still being detained. It is heard that the Japanese Navy in Shanghai is quite dissatisfied with the "Special Municipal Government" intruding into the Huangpu River. This is the first time that the Chinese police of the "Municipal Government" have extended their activities to the ships berthed in the Huangpu River.</p>

<p>Liu Shaozeng, a 25-year-old man from Dongtai, Jiangbei, lives in a bungalow on Jisi Feier Road in western Shanghai. At 3:45 a.m. yesterday morning, Liu got up as usual and went to the Triangle Ground to wait for a large truck to go to the Shiliupu Market in Nanshi to sell vegetables. Unexpectedly, five bandits searched him for banknotes and foreign money and tried to escape. Liu had only this capital of more than one hundred yuan on him. If it was robbed, it would be difficult for him to make a living. So he shouted for the police. The bandits were angry and ashamed when they saw him calling the police. They actually took out a gun and fired several shots at Liu. Two bullets hit Liu's head, and blood flowed like a stream. He was injured and fell to the ground. Afterwards, someone discovered him and sent him to the hospital for treatment. It is heard that his life is in critical condition.</p>

<p>It is reported that the floor of the second floor of the Shirun Elementary School at the Renmei Lane entrance of Xizilaihuo Street in the French Concession collapsed at 8:00 p.m. the night before, injuring many elementary school students. It is now found that the principal of the elementary school is He Jialin. There are more than one hundred students of all grades, who are taught in grades during the day. The school is a three-story city house, which is let to the women's voluntary night school organized by the China Women's Mutual Aid Association for teaching at night. Every Saturday night at 8:00 p.m., the night school is required to hold a general weekly meeting, where teachers and students of the whole school perform dramas. At about 8:00 p.m. the night before, while the drama was being performed, 7,000 or 8,000 teachers and students of the whole school gathered on the second floor to jump and perform. However, the house was built by the Tongren Fu Yuan Tang and was about to be twenty years old. The floor joists were dilapidated and could not bear the weight. Suddenly, the joists broke and the floor collapsed, and all the teachers and students in the hall fell down, resulting in injuries of varying degrees of severity. Among them, nine people were seriously injured with head injuries, and more than ten people were slightly injured. The police sent ambulances to the scene to send the injured to Guangci Hospital for treatment. The front and back doors were sealed and nailed, and a Chinese policeman was stationed day and night. Yesterday, the principal posted a notice on the school gate, saying, "To all students, yesterday, students from the women's voluntary night school jumped and played on the second floor, causing a part of the floor to collapse. We are now negotiating with the person in charge of the night school. Once the matter is resolved, we will make another public announcement. We hope that all our students will not make a fuss and wait quietly for the resumption of classes. This notice."</p>

<p>The "Continental Daily" reported that Deputy Corporal Davis of the West Fork Hill High Ground Team of the British Army stationed in Shanghai was shot and killed by Ike Ford, a British soldier from the same team, with a public service gun when he was stationed at the corner of North Xizang Road and Kaifeng Road in the western Hongkou district last night (the 4th). According to the news last night, Davis and Ike had been at odds for a long time, and the shooting incident resulted. The British military authorities are responsible for the investigation. It is heard that Ike has been arrested. The British military officer responsible for the investigation only admitted that the case had occurred in response to reporters' questions last night, but did not disclose the details, but firmly stated that the matter was purely an internal event of the barracks and had nothing to do with the Japanese. The incident occurred at about 10:00 p.m. The British military headquarters and the Huishi Police Station were immediately notified. Police detectives conducted a preliminary investigation, but since the case was a British military affair, the military authorities were responsible for handling it. It is heard that the discord between Davis and Ike was not a recent occurrence. There was an argument yesterday evening, and the mutual contention intensified in the evening, which eventually led to the tragedy. Davis was taken to the British Army Hospital next to Jiujiang Road after being shot, and died on the way.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Letters to the Editor <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor of the Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Regarding the news item published in your newspaper on the 3rd of this month, in the local news section, entitled "Dancer Abandoned, Sues for Recognition of Daughter," Ms. Xue Meiying, the party involved, states that it is completely inconsistent with the facts. Ms. Meiying was originally a widow. In 1937, she was introduced to Li Xianglu by a friend. He claimed to be unmarried and repeatedly expressed his affection and proposed marriage, even requesting cohabitation. In April of this year, Ms. Meiying was six months pregnant. Li Xianglu made excuses to go to Hong Kong and has not returned. Despite repeated inquiries, he avoids meeting. Ms. Meiying then realized she had been deceived. In July of this year, the baby was born, but Li Xianglu remained silent and indifferent. Left with no other choice, she filed a lawsuit. The judge, Mr. Li, of the First Special District Court, ruled that the daughter, Lingling, be recognized by the defendant, Li Xianglu, and that he be responsible for her support. The allegation that Ms. Meiying is a dancer is clearly based on inaccurate rumors. It is certainly malicious slander and serves another purpose. In addition to investigating the source of this news item and pursuing legal action, we request that your publication issue a correction to avoid misleading the public. Therefore, we are sending this letter to request that you grant the correction. Sincerely, Qian Jiahuan, Attorney-at-Law, November 5th.</p>
<p>To the Editorial Department of the Shen Bao:</p>
<p>Regarding the section of the Changxing News report in your newspaper on the 4th of this month, the final paragraph is inconsistent with the facts. Since the incident, this mine has been completely self-financed to maintain the livelihoods of the mine workers, which has lasted for two years. There has been no inducement by others to excavate the mine. We respectfully request that you investigate and grant a correction. We would be most grateful. Sincerely, Shanghai Changxing Coal Mine Co., Ltd., November 5th.</p>

<h3 id="e90">Participating in the Telephone Company Trainee Exam <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>I was fortunate enough to learn from my friend, Mr. Wang, the following:</p>
<p>"Our company (the telephone company) is recruiting some trainees. The future prospects are quite good. After three years of training, you will be a deputy engineer."</p>
<p>This made me extremely excited, and I rushed over. After his introduction, I immediately went to take the first round of oral examination with a foreign engineer. After a short conversation in the first round, he agreed to let me participate in this round of the exam and asked me to fill out a resume, entirely in English, of course.</p>
<p>"There are more than 80 people taking this round of the exam, and only five will be accepted." On the day of the exam, Mr. Wang told me like that: "And the outside world doesn't know about it. Except for a few graduates from the Shanghai Municipal Council Middle School—selected from their school—otherwise, there must be acquaintances inside. Be careful when taking the exam, don't panic!" Thank you for reminding me like that. However, there were more than 80 people in total, and I was really a bit panicked. If it were an open recruitment, then I think it would increase by at least several tens of times, right?</p>
<p>The oral exam was about general knowledge questions and answers. He asked you, "Where are the Racecourse and the Waibaidu Bridge?" He also gave you more than ten different colors and asked you to say the English names of these colors, sorted by category. He also asked you to count a thing with many pinholes, and asked you to count clearly how many needles there were in this thing. These were tested by a Chinese engineer. The oral exam by the foreign engineer consisted of many questions that tested your "cleverness." You just need to be calm, and you will definitely be able to answer them correctly. For example: "The result of three plus six divided by three multiplied by five minus six multiplied by three," "A large box contains three small boxes, and each of these three small boxes contains four even smaller boxes, so how many boxes are there in total?" However, you have to answer these questions quickly. In the end, he asked you to make a phone call, mainly about reporting the time. Remember! Pick up the receiver with your left hand, and only dial the number with your right hand after hearing the dial tone. In that way, half of the examinees were eliminated.</p>
<p>Only 42 of us were left in the second round.</p>
<p>The second round was divided into a written test, an oral exam, and a "practical." The topics for the written test, in Chinese, English, and math, were easy, but the test questions had to be answered in English. Even the essay topic was in "English." If you usually pay attention to the announcements of the Municipal Council, it is very easy to hand in the paper. For example, the "Chinese to English translation" section in this round's English test was a section from "Safety First."</p>
<p>The last one was the "practical," such as making a "telephone" and a "hexagon house" out of lead wire. After another oral exam, it was over. This oral exam was much easier than the previous one. For example, he gave you more than ten things to look at and asked you to write down their names within five minutes. Then he gave you many kinds of things and asked you to separate them by category. He also gave you the names and addresses of two mansions and asked you to find their phone numbers. (Guo Ying)</p>

<h3 id="e92">School Uniforms Using National Products Movement <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Recently, schools in Shanghai have begun a movement to use national products for uniforms, and schools like Furen and Aurora have taken the lead. If various schools can support it, this movement will expand, and it is quite meaningful to implement the use of national products at this time and place. But whether it can be successful in the future depends on whether various schools can adhere to and implement it.</p>
<p>In schools, whether teachers or students, all are intellectuals and outstanding individuals. Whether the promotion of national products can be effective depends on whether the education sector can implement the use of national products. In the past, national products promotion movements were held almost every year. We seem to be used to these high-sounding arguments. However, strictly speaking, what was the result of various movements such as advocating national products and using national products? The effect is equal to zero.</p>
<p>Repeatedly launching national products promotion movements, but the result is failure. The crux is that the middle class of intellectuals cannot take the lead in implementing it. Although they say that advocating national products is the best way to save the country, as long as they have money, they still prefer foreign goods when buying things. Taking the school aspect alone, whether in books or in teachers' mouths, the issue of using national products is often discussed, which is an urgent matter in the midst of China's crisis. However, whether teachers or students, nineteen out of ten wear suits or foreign fabrics. Can it be effective if you only talk about it and cannot implement it?</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the European War, the prices of imported goods skyrocketed. If we still want to buy unnecessary foreign goods, we are consciously consuming, and the country is weakening its ability to resist the war. Therefore, both in terms of time and space, the intellectual class should take the lead in implementing the use of national products. We can see that it is particularly meaningful for some schools in Shanghai to advocate the use of national products at this time!</p>
<p>However, because the national products promotion movement has repeatedly failed in the past, we must seriously conduct a self-examination. We are talking about using national products in our mouths. Every teacher and every student should examine themselves to see if they have implemented the use of national products. Otherwise, talking is empty talk, which is equivalent to not advocating it, and the result is failure, and the effect is zero. We believe that if schools can truly implement the use of national products, they will definitely be able to quickly promote this trend to all classes, and the result can enable Chinese national product manufacturers in the midst of the European War to obtain a great opportunity and develop indefinitely, which can further help the country's strength to resist the war. Therefore, the author wants to hope that the school uniforms using national products movement launched this time will not only strive to promote it rapidly, but also be able to implement it, and avoid repeating the mistakes of the past, so that it can be effective, otherwise it is still just firing a blank shot.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Seventeen: Learning Fieldwork, a New Realm for Reporters; Practicing Internally, a Small Stage in the Dormitory</p>
<p>A newspaper reporter, although not an omniscient and omnipotent God, should know a little about everything. The richer his common sense, the better. However, there is no end to common sense, and it progresses with the times. How can he enrich his common sense? The only proper way is through schooling. Originally, the father of this Miss Shao Huihua was also in the newspaper industry. Seeing that his precious daughter had a talent for news, she had shown her talent from a young age, and could carry on his legacy. He naturally wanted to cultivate her into the most outstanding female newspaper reporter. In order to enrich her common sense, he sent her to a famous American university to study journalism. But what is the use of just learning some journalism in the classroom and in books? Therefore, he still focused on everything in the country. The country's history, the country's geography, the country's customs, and the country's politics and society. Shao Huihua's father was a war correspondent for several years during the Sino-Japanese War. He had suffered a lot under the hail of bullets and the clouds of artillery fire. He was also an experienced old reporter. Now that his daughter is coming out to be a reporter, fortunately the war has been settled. Otherwise, he would think that a young girl should come to be a war correspondent. Although they are heroines, and they have this courage and are not afraid of anything, the father is a person who has been through it all, and he talks about tigers and changes his color. He can't help but feel a little worried in the end? Miss Shao Huihua was originally a very intelligent girl. After a few years of studying abroad and experiencing things in China, of course, her common sense is extremely rich. In addition to common sense, she devoted herself to various skills. That is, as mentioned above, driving a car, flying an airplane, boating, riding a horse, climbing mountains, ice skating, swimming, playing ball, and everything else. She learns one thing and knows one thing. Not only can she do everything, but she is also proficient in everything. With talent and cultivation, we must talk about the third thing, interest. If she is very devoted to this for a while, but soon abandons it, this interest is not enough to support this for a long time. Only when she feels interested in this matter, no matter how hard she suffers, she is willing to do her best, that is considered complete. Seeing that Miss Shao Huihua can learn all kinds of technical things, it can be seen that she is interested in all kinds of skills. It was like this before, and it will be like this in the future. Combining talent, cultivation, and interest, three major things, to create such an excellent and complete newspaper reporter, and still a young woman, isn't this rare and valuable? (199)</p>
<h3 id="e94">Banning Unsound Alley Schools <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Er</p>
<p>The "alley schools" in Shanghai were originally too numerous to count. After the city fell, they became even more conspicuous. Among them, those who struggled hard and regarded educating children as their primary task could not be completely dismissed. However, most of the "alley schools" have completely turned into commercialized "academic shops." Because rents are expensive, and all equipment is simple and crude, which is understandable. However, taking advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, people who are ignorant and unskilled also rent a house, hang up a copper plate, and start a school. They simply don't understand what "education" is. As long as the classrooms are filled with students and the tuition fees are collected, it is a good deal. For example, in a small school in the alley where I live, too many students are admitted, and even the back building with no light is used as a classroom, but it still cannot accommodate them. So every hour, a class of students has "gymnastics class" in the alley, and it is beautifully called "paying attention to physical education." From this, we can know that those "alley schools" on the "isolated island" that truly regard educating children as their primary task are indeed as rare as phoenix feathers.</p>
<p>In yesterday's newspaper, we read another piece of news: The Shi Lun Elementary School at 181 Xizilaihuo Street in the French Concession is a single three-story building along the road, with more than 70 students. Yesterday was Saturday, and the students were still playing in the school after school. At 7:40 PM, more than 20 students were jumping and playing on the second floor when the floor joists suddenly broke, and the floor collapsed instantly. All the students fell down with it, falling into a pile, crying and shouting endlessly. The section of Xizilaihuo Street is crowded with vendors and noisy all day long. It is already a problem whether this place is suitable for "studying." Now, unfortunately, such a tragedy has occurred, which shows that the school operators pay little attention to all the facilities of the school, and education is naturally out of the question. The mental loss suffered by these students is already great, and now they have to suffer physical pain, which is really heartbreaking. From this point alone, these unsound "alley schools" do need to be investigated and banned. Regarding this "building collapse case," the police are investigating the inside story, but the collapse of the building is a fact, and the principal should be fully responsible, and in any case, cannot escape responsibility.</p>

<h3 id="e95">"Open Day" and "Bowl of Rice" Movement <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>A Reuter dispatch from New York on October 31 states: The United China Relief Association will hold an "Open Day" for two days in New York's Chinatown from November 7th to 8th, and a "Bowl of Rice" movement will be held at the Pierre Hotel on November 9th to raise annual funds. Colonel Roosevelt (son of the former President Roosevelt), Chairman of the Association, stated, "We cannot hope to relieve all 60 million Chinese refugees, but we can save many lives and reduce the suffering of refugees with the proceeds from the Open Day and the Bowl of Rice movement," and so on.</p>
<p>After reading this telegram, we feel infinite hidden pain in our hearts. What is placed before us on the isolated island is: no freedom of speech, no freedom of action, unable to speak out, unable to return home. How easy is it to open up your actions and freedom. The "Open Day" held in Chinatown, thousands of miles away across the ocean, with exhibitions of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, displaying the culture of China's founding for thousands of years, must have a lively and brilliant unfolding. Following this, the Americans are holding a "Bowl of Rice" movement for our compatriots in distress. The merit of "considering compatriots and caring for them" will truly be felt to the core by our compatriots who are trapped in deep water and scorching fire!</p>
<p>The author witnessed that some people on the isolated island eat fish and meat every morning, and shrimp and crabs every night, eating themselves full of brains and fat. Some people have: a bowl of "yellow rice" with radishes, green vegetables, or spicy flowers and bean dregs. Some are even unable to obtain a single meal. They are all compatriots in the period of national crisis, but the disparity in enjoyment is so great!</p>
<p>I wonder what those who are full of brains and fat feel when they see the great sympathy of the Americans' "Bowl of Rice" movement? The glory and shame of mankind are in the "one thought" of the residents of the isolated island and the aristocratic housewives, right?</p>
<h3 id="e96">The Problem of Winter Clothing for Compatriots in Distress <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Ran</p>
<p>It is late autumn, and the weather is getting colder day by day, which really makes people feel that it is an appropriate time to add warm clothing.</p>
<p>For people who are wealthy and pampered, the issue of adding warm clothing is really not a problem. With money, you have everything. The most pitiful are the compatriots in distress who are wandering on the "isolated island" due to the war. They watch the weather getting colder day by day, but they still don't know where their "winter clothes" are.</p>
<p>According to the report of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, there are still more than 30,000 compatriots in distress wandering on the isolated island. What these many compatriots are currently urgently worried about is this serious winter clothing issue.</p>
<p>For this reason, the author hopes with all my heart that the people who are generally well-off on the isolated island will promote the heart of "feeling cold when others feel cold," sympathize with the sadness of the compatriots in distress who are displaced and wandering, and provide appropriate relief. All the old and unused clothes, big and small, at home should be given to the Refugee Relief Association according to the situation, and the association will distribute them to male and female compatriots in distress. For those who do not have old clothes, I hope they can save some unnecessary waste in their lives, such as dancing a few less dances, eating a few less large meals, playing a few less mahjong games, taking a few less car rides... then these money can be used to add winter clothes for the compatriots in distress. This kind of merit is really better than building a "seven-level pagoda."</p>
<p>Alas! The weather is cold, the matter is urgent. May the people on the isolated island who generally live above the poverty line pay attention to this winter clothing problem for the compatriots in distress.</p>

<p>— Xia Chen</p>
<p>The season has turned to late autumn, and soon the severe winter will come again. In this cold season, experience and habit tell us that it is the most suitable time to nourish the body. The author is willing to introduce a cheap supplement with nourishing properties to the public—that is soy milk.</p>
<p>Soy milk is commonly known as soymilk. In our country, it is a popular food. Generally, people think that this juice made from extremely ordinary and humble soybeans does not have much nourishing effect. In fact, this is a misconception. We only need to look at the statistics of the German biologist and nutritional chemistry expert, Mr. Koenig, on the composition of soybeans to understand its value. His statistics are as follows: 25 percent protein, 6 percent fat, 56 percent carbohydrates, 13 percent water, and other rich vitamins B and various minerals beneficial to the human body.</p>
<p>In this way, soybeans have excellent nutrients for the human body, then, after being ground into soy milk, it has a greater nourishing effect because it is easy to digest.</p>
<p>However, the soy milk usually sold on the market is either made with inferior soybeans or is not hygienic, and the taste is mostly bad. Therefore, if we want to drink it, it is best to make it ourselves. The procedure for making it is as follows: first soak the soybeans in clear water for five or six hours, then grind them into a slurry. After grinding, filter the slurry with a cloth bag to remove the residue. Finally, boil it and add a little sugar or soy sauce, MSG, etc. before drinking.</p>
<p>Although that's the way it is, what about in reality? Most of us small citizens are busy all day long making a living, so where do we have so much free time to do these things? Therefore, I hope that there is a kind of soy milk on the market that meets my ideal, but the price cannot be too high, then we can buy and drink it economically and conveniently. In the midst of the soaring prices of everything this year, I think this is what most people are longing for!</p>

<p>— Fang Jiu Cao</p>
<p>——British Representative of Moral Re-Armament——</p>
<p>Boer, this name seems very unfamiliar, not as loud as Stalin and Chamberlain. But in the British Isles, there is no one who doesn't know his name. At that time, many people sympathized with him, and many people felt a headache when they heard his name. But now, almost everyone has a good impression of him!</p>
<p>Boer came from a worker in a factory in London. He once led the workers to rise up against the cruel oppression of the capitalists, but for this reason, he lost his job. After losing his job, he gathered many workers—up to thousands at most—to destructively damage the buildings of capitalists. He believed that the capitalists who ran businesses were the enemies of the workers, regardless of whether the store itself had any relationship with them. Therefore, many stores suffered innocent losses. They often took advantage of the night to smash the large windows of the stores. Each time they acted, at least hundreds of stores suffered misfortune. Therefore, the merchants in London would frown and shake their heads when they heard the name of Boer.</p>
<p>At one point, everyone thought Boer was an incorrigible rogue. Everyone avoided him like a plague, and no one dared to approach him. The neighbor behind his house specially built a solid fence around the house to prevent Boer's intrusion.</p>
<p>Finally, he—Boer—after receiving sincere advice from his friends and receiving many valuable lessons that money could not buy, realized that his behavior was indeed very wrong. So, he repented and intended to be kind. In less than a few months, he changed greatly.</p>
<p>When this news reached people's ears, everyone thought it was a strange thing and expressed infinite surprise at Boer's sudden change of attitude. Many of Boer's friends gradually restored their friendship with him, and the neighbor behind his house even took the initiative to remove the fence. And they came over to shake hands with Boer and talk about the past, and they were very happy.</p>
<p>This time, Boer represented his country to attend the Moral Re-Armament Conference in Asia. At the meeting, he told the audience the story of this "fence" and said, "There are even more invisible 'fences' between people. I hope everyone will use the four standards of 'sincerity,' 'purity,' 'unselfishness,' and 'universal love' to dismantle them."</p>

<p>— Mrs. Huaying</p>
<p>The weather is gradually getting colder; for lunch and dinner every day, it would be nice to eat some rich, meaty dishes. Now, I will introduce a particularly rich dish called Braised Pig Trotters with Soybeans. You only need to spend four or five dimes to buy a few pig trotters, wash them carefully and thoroughly, add more sugar and soy sauce (preferably rock sugar), combine them with soybeans, put them in a pot, and simmer them over low heat. After simmering for three or four hours, the pig trotters will definitely be tender. If you want to be more refined, add some raw chestnuts and gingko nuts; they are even more chewable. Once the pig trotters are tender, all the soybeans, chestnuts, and gingko nuts will have been tender for a long time. Braised like this, the broth is sweet and rich, and very delicious. The pig trotters themselves are undoubtedly fatty and delicious, but the most important thing is the word "tender." If it's not tender, it's much worse.</p>

<p>— Wang Yizhi, sent from the Netherlands</p>
<p>Chinese cuisine is the best in the world, and its most precious treasure, which is not available in Western cuisine today, is not fatty chicken and meat, but the commoner's tofu. As for the "water tofu" produced in Nanchang, Jiangxi, it is truly a supreme delicacy that is hard to enjoy again even if you travel the world. In ancient China, drinking water and eating beans was used as a metaphor for filial piety. If we combine the words "water" and "beans," then "water beans" is probably a natural nickname for Nanchang's "water tofu." On the morning of June 26th of this year, Zhao Shi happily showed me a group photo of the Hu family from Shanghai, and I immediately wrote two quatrains to reply to my brother Hu Zhixiang, and also to present to Lian Zhang. Recalling the events of thirty years ago, I then included water beans in my poem, saying:</p>
<p>Examining the ashes after the calamity of the tall firs, my clever mind initially chases away the opening of a smile, if people like you meet my eyes, the messenger from the lane of clear shade has come. (Dream record)</p>
<p>Since returning from Pengze, my intention has been at ease, tall trees in the courtyard shade the fragrant orchids, looking up at the events of thirty years ago, I report the flavor of water beans with a pair of boots. (Realism)</p>
<p>According to research, the raw material for water tofu is soybeans, also known as large beans, which in English is called "Soy." In Western Europe, it is commonly called "Soja." (Webster's dictionary cites Japanese text, claiming that Soja is a variation of the word for soy sauce, which is inevitably far-fetched). The botanical name in Latin is Glycine hispida, which means it is related to the sweet root plant. The value of soybeans lies in their ability to be used for clothing, food, housing, and transportation.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about food. Soybeans contain "Glycinin," which, in sound and meaning, should be translated as sweet plant matter, and is actually the most chemically abundant protein, including various "amino acids" necessary for human life (German: Aminosaure). When used as food, its function is comparable to animal proteins such as beef and meat, unlike other plant proteins, which are deficient in one or two of the necessary amino acids. Moreover, in terms of fat ratio, soybean flour is ten times better than other flours, and soybeans are thirty times better than other beans. In terms of protein ratio, soybean flour is twice as good as other beans, with a ratio of two to one, while soybeans are fifteen times better than other beans. Therefore, eating more tofu can save countless eggs, and the health benefits of tofu are no less than those of fresh milk. Western society is unfamiliar with making tofu, and vegetarians often face the worry of starving to death like Chen Shuo. Vegetarianism and abstaining from killing have almost become a unique blessing for Chinese people. All my impoverished compatriots, if they remember that it is not easy to enjoy the richness of tofu overseas, should rise up and promote bean foods, so that in the autumn of expensive rice and meat, they can find unexpected relief.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about clothing. The glycinin contained in soybeans is very beneficial for industrial manufacturing, no different from the casein that can be extracted from milk. East Asians drink very little milk, but drink a lot of tofu milk. If Chinese industrialists know how to imitate the German method of manufacturing milk wool and extract glycinin, and then make artificial wool silk (Lanital), they will present a different spectacle in addition to the British soybean oil industry.</p>
<p>As for the fact that the soybean industry can be of great benefit to housing and transportation, please learn from our friendly neighbor across the Pacific Ocean. It is heard that the Ford automobile factory in the United States has already learned to use the glycinin in soybeans, with the help of anhydrous formic acid, to apply pressure and produce a man-made resin that is stronger than iron and lighter than wood. This is what the industrial community in Shanghai calls "bakelite," which can be used for car window frames, door handles, or driving levers, and can also be used as electrical insulation material. This is how soybeans benefit transportation. For other uses, such as manufacturing paper, soap, paint, oilcloth, linoleum, printing colors, and household gadgets, the raw materials can all be obtained from soybeans. Therefore, soybeans are beneficial to housing. The benefits of Chinese people promoting soybean foods are too numerous to mention. If the people of the country take advantage of this opportunity, what could be more enjoyable?</p>
