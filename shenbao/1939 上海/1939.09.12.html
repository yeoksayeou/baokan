<p>巴黎　據今日此間消息、波蘭軍隊現集中於華沙北郊沿維斯都拉河一帶、德軍之强渡者、皆爲波軍所消滅、又聞昨晚整晚華沙北郊一帶、有可怖之惡戰、波軍抵抗極爲得手、據波方稱德軍因後方交通綫拉長、故其機械化部隊之推進力、已不如已往之猛烈、（十一日美聯電）</p>
<p>比京　今晨柏林無綫電台廣播德軍戰報稱、波蘭境內大戰已達決勝點、波軍在南部力抗德軍進攻、但已被德軍所迫、渡聖河退却云、最近消息已證實、兩軍現正在距華沙五哩之處作戰、又據此間所接波方消息、由克拉哥向東北前進之德軍、現已停頓、該方而德軍似已疲勞、波軍士氣並未頹喪、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　據今日此間消息、華沙戰爭、現在華沙東北與西南兩方猛烈進行中、此戰可以決定戰爭全局、布格河已成華沙東北最後防綫、德軍在該河上現正搭架橋樑、準備渡河、那累夫河與布格河之間、戰爭仍極猛烈、可見該處德軍尚未站住脚跟、華沙西南自洛資華沙鐵路北達維斯都拉河之桑洞米茲一帶、現正進行更大規模之戰爭、德國向西北方面推進之一支軍隊、數日來音信全無、現聞已進抵華沙西五十五英哩之處、即維斯都拉河之北岸、聞其所經過之區域中、遺留之波軍尙多、故不能向前疾進、德方目前進攻華沙之計劃、即爲三面合圍、一路由布格河向南推進、二路由東北越維斯都拉河向華沙推進、三路由南方向華沙推進、德方對於戰事認爲樂觀、（十一日美聯電）</p>

<p>羅馬尼亞京城　哈瓦斯社駐華沙訪員已自波蘭到達羅馬尼亞、據稱、此行全程三分之一、即自華沙至盧勃林城一段、僅有鐵路綫一條、已由德國飛機猛烈轟炸、各主要軍略地點、亦時時遭受空襲、波蘭與羅馬尼亞匈牙利之交通、因而感受影響、極為濡緩、此外、德國飛機多架自本月五日午後七時起至七日午刻止、不斷以小型炸彈轟炸波蘭國各公路、職是之故、波蘭國西綫傷兵運往東部爾伏甫城暨運輸軍隊軍械前往華沙、均大爲躭誤、波蘭當局業已遺派大批工人輪流前往修理、輒能迅速予以修復、要而言之、德軍所配車械較爲犀利、此于波蘭自屬不利、所幸該國士氣奮發、無以復加、仍能抗戰如故、至以西綫而論、德國邊界居民在法國軍隊開始進攻後、業已向斯都伽脫城佛朗克孚城疏散、波蘭國民衆聞悉之餘、極爲興奮、該國公報雖承認戰事失利、但民衆並不因而氣餒云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>莫斯科　蘇聯報紙日來疊有登載英國對蘇聯不友好舉動之消息、據稱截至八月底止、蘇聯在英商務機關業已遭遇達反英蘇商務關係之事件多項、例如英國亨利白萊商號曾將蘇聯機器輸入局定購之壓床四具停止製造、阿齊台爾商號拒絕業已造成之機器十具運往蘇聯、而通知蘇方收貨人、稱該批機器業被英政府微用、巴金生商號亦拒將定購機器運蘇、稱係奉英政府命令、赫白德商號不但拒將蘇方收貨代表業已查騐之機器二十七具運出、並悍然拒將破壞合同之理由說明、邱吉爾及歐克哈德兩商號則將蘇聯進口機關分別定製機器三具及十四具之合同片面取消、關於英商此類破壞合同不守信用之事件、蘇聯駐英商務代表機關收有不少證據、並曾向英國政府機關疊次提出聲請、但均無效果、英國商務部並拒不簽發業經蘇方付款、推積碼頭待運之樹膠八百五十五噸之出口護照、雖屢經請求亦屬無效、又蘇方商務代表請求准將所購咖啡豆一千噸由英輪「格蘭生亞號」轉裝蘇輪、歷時多日、亦無結果、上述英商及英政府機關之行動、已將英蘇商業關係根本破壞、（十日塔斯電）</p>

<p>倫敦　英國政府昨晚宣佈、業已採取各種措置、準備作戰三年、此間一般人加以評論、咸謂波蘭即使戰敗、德國亦休想和平了結、英國政府昨晚之聲明、即在以此意警吿德國、同時幷欲使全世界輿論、不可奢望德國政治在短時期內即行崩潰、質言之、對德開戰之後、非作持久之計、不能奏功、英國人民深知此次戰事、必須堅持到底、因此對於時局演進、咸能處以鎮靜、此在外交界人士則請、英國政府昨日之聲明、幷非就戰事前送加以臆測、此其用意、端在證明英國抱有從事消耗戰之決心、幷已採取各項必要措置、以冀達到最後勝利云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　此間外交界人士頃宣稱、德國方面原望現行戰事、得以局部化、此種幻想、似已漸趨消滅、觀於德國西綫發生接觸一事、該國各無錢電台廣播消息、業於本日初决提及可以窺見之、該國航空部長戈林上將、昨向柏林軍火廠工人發表演說、其用意亦在曉示國內工人、吿以戰事範圍、恐將擴大、其期限亦將較預料爲久、實則此種情事、即在各中立國亦已了解及之、惟此所謂中立國、頗有加以研究之價値、一般人對於未參加戰事各國、概以中立國目之、實則此等國家、可分爲三類、瑞士比利時兩國中立地位、曾由各國依照國際公法予以承認、是爲第一類、匈牙利南斯拉夫羅馬尼亞三國、受現行條的之約束、與某某國較相接近、以視他國爲甚、茲亦避不牽入旋渦、是爲第二類、此外另有若干國家、認爲所保有之利益、不因交戰各國所採取之立塲而受有影響、因而保守中立、是爲第三類、但此類國家之態度、非以固定的原則爲歸宿、而以事勢爲根據、德國所謂對波戰事可以局部化、殆暗射此類國家而言云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>歐洲局面從極度緊張而至於爆裂，全世界視綫於是集中於歐戰；因此關於最近中日戰事的情勢，不免暫時爲國際的非常激變所掩蔽，其實依然不容忽視。因爲中國既是世界政治的一環，中國抗戰又可說是全世界發動「反侵略」戰的前驅；這在根本意義上，不可顧彼失此。但看英國外相鄭重聲明遠東政策決不變更，日蘇雙方都吾認締結互不侵犯條的，美國實行增强遠東防務；而重慶國民政府當局又鄭重聲明，兩年來再接再厲的抗戰政策，必將維持到底；在日本方面，他的新首相阿部亦說「有人以爲歐戰將予日本以易於解決對華事務之機會，則實屬大誤」云云。凡此種種動態，顯見中日戰事不因歐戰而減低其比重，亦即關於中日戰局的發展，仍應加以最嚴密的注意。</p>
<p>觀中日戰事全局，大概自七月中旬以來，各方面都在膠着狀態之中。其間比較重要的交綏在山西省；山西作戰的重心則又分爲晋西與晋東南。晋西戰事，從本月初起又趨緊張，日軍經汾陽孝義回竄離（石）中（陽）綫，向柳林軍渡磧口進攻，企圖渡過黃河，進窺第八路軍根據地延安。據七日重慶電，朱德已親赴前綫作戰；同時，陝省華軍連日紛紛渡河的，數逾十萬，可見又有一塲血戰，即將展開。晋東南方面的戰事，仍膠着於長治長子壺關潞城一帶，華軍發揮流動戰略，迭予日軍重創，又能利用大雨，異常活躍，而日軍無法施展。西北行營主任程潛已飛往晋南，指揮華軍十萬，由黃河南岸北渡，聲勢極壯。縱觀目前晋省戰事，日軍顯受天時地利人力的三重壓迫。地利與人力的壓迫尙在日軍估計之中，而天災流行，則出其意料。最近華北大水，河北全省以及豫北魯西，盡成澤國；晋南又大雨，各交通幹綫完全冲毀，日軍不但接濟困難，輜重軍實亦大有損失。自從洪（洞）古（羅）公路被華軍澈底破壞後，橫貫晋東南的唯一運輸綫又完全在華軍掌握；長此留連，頗有被華軍各個擊破的可能。據路透社北千十日電，晋南日軍多已撒退，開往東三省；窺其意態，日軍顯已放棄晋南，而僅求保持晋北及石家莊與太原間的鐵路。晋南既已放棄，晋西日軍縱能飛渡黃河，自亦不敢孤軍深入。足見山西戰局，已可穩定一時；而日軍顚覆八路軍根據地，以及截斷中蘇交通的企圖，亦由事實反證其爲夢想。</p>
<p>此外，如在廣東方面，東北兩江的華軍已發動反攻，圍攻增城壓迫從化；潮安已告克復；且控制了江門新會。至於冀南膠東蘇北江南各區，華軍游擊隊的活躍，證明了日軍所謂掃蕩戰的失敗。鄂北戰况沉寂。鄂南豫北豫東閩東南海等區則僅有局部接觸。</p>
<p>以軍事而論，分區作戰，各有使命，沒有一區可予疎忽；但就一期間一段落而論，則有重輕之辨。目前最値得注意的重心，已非晋西而爲鄂中。據美聯社八日重慶電稱「據此間軍事家觀察，日木似圖於九。十月閒在湖北方面作最後一决之進攻，企圖戰事之早日結束。其進攻路綫可分爲二：第一，沿漢水經襄陽樊城進抵老河口；然後西向而窺漢中；至漢中後，再向北進以達西安；同時又威脅成都之公路交通。第二，即渡漢水而窺江陵宜昌，控制長江之航運；同時使重慶不絕受日機之空襲。」</p>
<p>「據可靠方面消息，日方現預備砲艦五十艘，作進攻沙市宜昌之用……。陸軍亦在陸上同時進攻。閒鄂西日軍現已增加一師團……尙圖自日本調兵來華增援。」</p>
<p>同事據報，連日華中華軍亦備戰甚忙，開抵長江兩岸的生力軍已逾三十萬，大戰巳在醞釀中。記得今年四月間日軍亦曾發動進攻鄂中以窺川陝的戰略，結果因輕兵西進，交通綫爲華軍切斷而慘遭失敗；這便是遐邇艷稱的大別山之戰。現在日本所謂新攻勢的目標，仍在這一方面；而華軍亦養精蓄銳，磨厲以須；預料必有一番劇戰，期不在遠。那時候的進退得失，我們暫不論斷；姑就軍略方面試加窺測，則華軍欲北守豫西陝雨，必須固守襄陽樊城；欲南保湖南，西保四川，亦不能不固守江陵宜昌；而二者之間，允以襄樊的得失最爲重要。因爲長江有三峽之險，日軍必不敢由水路挺進，非先在漢水東岸立足不可，所以襄樊之間，實是重要戰塲。至於江陵宜昌，日軍在進攻之前必須於湖南方面有强大兵力彼此呼應；可是湘東日軍屢决失利，局促一隅，僅保岳陽，實在無能爲力。於此可見日軍的策略還是攻襄樊爲主，江宜爲輔。這在華軍方面，沿漢水西岸，早已節節設防，日軍若逆流而上，極難得手；若由公路，雖東有襄花，西有鍾襄；然襄花路經過中部山地，華軍可以據險截擊；鍾襄路中有漢水橫隔，日軍亦不易輕易飛渡。再如由襄陽西入陝南，老河口以西盡爲山地，由漢中入蜀，雖有數路可通，又都是險峻山道，冒險進兵，成敗利鈍，眞是未可知也。我們暫時不說中國獲一大勝的機會即在目前，但中國這决獲勝的可能，確比日本方面爲大。退幾步說：日本企圖以這一决新攻勢來結束中日戰事，則除了日軍大敗而歸，日本必然會失望的。日本大的必須再取一百决新攻勢，一百决全勝。纔有結束戰事的希望；中國祗預備在一百决之中，全勝一次、便有機會來收拾戰局了！</p>

<p>美國公意局長茄勒普博士、近公布該局的測騐、在中日戰爭進入第三年時、美國人的意見、大多數贊成採取積極行動、保護美國在華的利益、測騐中投票人只四分之一以爲美政府對於中國、應當「無所行動、」其餘的四分之三、贊成三種確切的行動途徑、第一批人數不多、認爲美國應與日本戰、第二批人數較多、只要美國在華利益似遭妨礙時、由國務院向日政府提出抗議便滿足、人數最多的第三批、相信行動的適當途徑是供給日軍的美國軍器和戰具悉數停運、</p>
<p>這次測騐、是在美國各州投票人的橫斷面之間舉行的、問題是、美政府保護美國在華利益、該到何種地步、投票人在美政府可遵循的四種政策中抉選、（一）對日作戰、（二）經國務院向日本抗議、（三）停止美國一切戰具運日、（四）無所行動、投票結果如决、贊成作戰的百分之六、抗議的百分之十八、停運的百分之五十一、無所行動的百分之二十五、</p>
<p>與美國公意局相聯絡的英國公意局、在英倫作相類的測騐、發覺英人投票人較美國投票人更切望在華取確切行動、英國投票人五分之一以上認爲如有必要、英國應對日作戰、共餘的贅成終止英日問一切貿易、或以信用放款和軍火供給中國、或是召回英國駐日大使、作爲抗議、僅一小批（百分之十五）認爲英國應「無所行動」、</p>
<p>英國所作的測騐、在字面上稍有不同、結果是、對成作戰的百分之二十二、停止對日一切貿易的百分之三十七、以軍器供給中國的百分之十七、召回英大使作爲抗議的百分之九、無所行動的百分之十五、測騐結果、在兩個總數上有着重大意義、據中國發來華方消息日軍發動反英運動企圖激起日人的反英情緒、至今絕未組織反美運動、然而公意局的測騐、表示美人對日本的感情、並不比英人的更見友好、美國的測騐、和兩年前中日戰爭開始時、美國境內的情緒相比較、也有重大的意義、那時公意局的測騐發覺美國人很多贊成袖手旁觀、「無所行動」政策、以及美國國民和利益退出中國、大多數人還反對實施對日禁運、然而今日的意見、已轉向盼望採取行動之點、</p>
<p>美國的測騐披露、在地區方面、意見有若干饒興趣的不同、包括洛磯山或太平洋沿海在內的遠西區、最贊成採取保護在華美國利益的行動、遠西投票贊成「無所行動』的、較美國任何地方爲少、也許因爲該區在地理上、距日本最近、而最受太平洋事件的影響之故、各區投票結果如次、</p>
<p>美國測騐中投票人解釋他們的對日態度、所舉贊成行動的理由、種類繁多、贊成最極端的途徑的對日作戰、聲明美國早晚必與日本作戰、我們應帮助「遏止無賴國、」贊成對日禁運戰具的、可由一個投票人、紐的州特洛埃地方某主婦的意見作代表、她說、「我們若不要戰爭、那末、爲何供給戰具呢、」</p>

<p>厦門通信、厦門日方首要人物、原有領事山田、及海軍司令官宮田義一、和特務機關長陸軍中佐澤川、今春「興亞院」成立、其聯絡部分設於北平·張家口·上海·厦門四處、日海軍少將水戶春造、奉該院之命、具着華南政治進攻負責人的責任到厦、於是厦門日方海軍派、得水戶之助、氣燄大張、如日軍部原已將侵閩大權交予陸軍主持水戶蒞厦後、遂改爲海軍主持、目前儘管陸軍派時思報復、在厦門日方各首要人物中、水戶却是一個挺紅的份子、他的出身、根據日方列物刋載如下、</p>
<p>「水戶春造、廣島縣人、一九〇八年海軍兵學校出身、歷任馬公要港部參謀長、加古·榛·等艦長、第二艦隊參謀長、吳警備隊司令官、馬公要港部司令官、前年秋以來、任軍令部出仕」「興亞院聯絡部」爲什麼不設在廣州而設在厦門、爲什麼一定要水戶春造充任部長、這裏面包涵着很大的作用、根據緒方昇的「興亞院述絡部與日長官」一文云、「厦門因爲在台灣對岸的關係、所以此地新設的連絡部、與其他三連絡部不同、與其說以中國人爲對手、倒不如說是台灣的延長（注意）因此厦門的述絡部長、是以曾任軍令系統之要職的水戶春造少將來擔任、在此可以注意的、是帮助他的人、是海軍特務部長原忠一大佐、」「興亞院」厦門聯絡部的設立、目的旣在作爲台灣的延長、說明白一點、就是要以厦門爲出發點、把華南各省全都變成台灣、變成囊中的殖民地、日方此等企圖、水戶是吾能够負起這責任呢、這却大成問題、華南侵略對象的閩粵兩省、兩年來、日方有什麼成就嗎、述絡部設立以後、有什麼新的成績收穫嗎、事實最爲雄辯、在廣束、日軍祗能困守廣州周國、攻陷潮汕後、已不能越雷池一步、福建呢、金厦兩島陷落後、一年來、日方毫無寸進、最近瘋狂地封鎖海口、也祗能騷擾無防禦的海島政治進攻呢、日方問諜漢奸的活動範圍、已日漸縮小了、水戶主持的厦門連絡部、確曾在這方面努力過、訓練一批之靑年、婦女。兒童、和尙、事實證明、這祗是徒費時間金錢與心血、他所訓練的問諜、沒有收穫到他所並望的效果的百分之一、水戶雖然資格老、手段辣、日方對他寄托着無限希望、但他也無能爲力不能有什麼成就唯一的成就、是壓倒內鬨中的陸軍派、給盤踞厦門的海軍派一個抬頭機會（未完）</p>

<p>外匯昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、但無上落、英美滙暗市、雖當天變動不大、但形勢則時緊時鬆、盤旋於週末午收價左右、初因多頭鑒於本埠滬西局勢、大都覜念保守、加之英行有利力吸現貨、兼港電與華行等猛扒期貨、致市勢軟化、英金曾緊至三辦士九〇六二五、美滙亦曾縮至六元牛、嗣後港電突來復吐、且有利與華銀行等亦反扒爲塞、並沙遜亦跟踪吐售、致市象一度鬆硬、英金曾長至四辦士〇六二五、美滙亦曾硬至六元八一二五、午刻因滙豐吃胃頗健、於是爲狀漸平、午收英金計四辦士、美滙爲六元七五、午後初時情况極平、入後因滙豐等外行互相吸進、致稍帶軟、結果以英金三辦士九三七五、美滙穴元六二五收盤、本月份趨勢與現貨相若、終則英美均微緊〇三二二五、全天交易尙旺、</p>

<p>昨日外幣市况、以滙市無甚軒輊、金價卒吿堅硬、故英鎊需求者頗殷、價漲五角、計爲九十三元五角、美鈔初做十五元三角左右、嗣因匯市一度趨硬、英滙曾長出四辦士關、同業拋塞甚勁、致乃步退至十四元八角左右、近午復稍回上至十四元九角强、午後以金價忽又昂至三千九百三十元、故公會掛牌價亦抬至十五元一角、但比上週末尙小一角、英金票亦軋跌五角、香港票降五分、其餘各幣尙穩、日金票於晨間十點鐘光景、竟高達一元四角、卒爲一元三角六分四厘、比上週末計漲三分叫厘、朝鮮謂趨勢亦挺、卒以一元一角六分五厘收盤、結果續漲三分五厘、</p>

<p>現棉交易、尙稱不弱、但比前日稍淸、實以歐美棉市又復回挫、外匯鬆懈、但核算價依然高昂、本棉正在新棉上結之際、白包花交易日見進展、至於日廠納胃略滯，不及昔日之暢健、因近來吸收之額量殊巨、惟申新。永安廠存底雖不匱乏、目前開出棉紗之額甚夥、將原料補進一批、同業中互相買賣、仍屬不絕如縷、長興號進印棉一千件、係抵解申新廠之額、新通州花漲五角至一元、外棉價略挺、蘇北來源稍稀、通州花到五百餘包、又北沙來六百五十件、茲將現棉情形列左、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來殊形活躍、前數日因海外棉市飛漲、匯兌緊縮、各同業之現貨價格亦跟而飛漲、昨日海外棉市略回、而本埠售價未能轉鬆、蓋因海外裝棉來滬、各項外費、殊爲浩大、目前洋行方面、無人訂購、已將三四月、目前之交易、悉爲同業間之現貨也、蓋因此項現貨、較之洋行定價、尙廉三數十之元也、</p>

<p>關於越界築路警權問題工部局此後究採何種舉動、大中社記者昨特訪晤英國駐滬某高級官員、叩詢眞相、據表示、工部局對於日僞越界侵權行動、絕對不能承認、因連日日兵僞警、雖有侵入越界築路之事、所佔據者、係路旁日軍佔領區中之房屋、從未干涉工部局在滬西一帶行使警權、故不擬採取立即行動、以增加事態之嚴重性、但已準備用外交方式、與日方進行磋商、蓋爲防止金洛克同樣事件發生、工部局似不得不採取此種步驟、</p>
<p>傅局方已開始交涉</p>
<p>昨晨西報記載、謂工部局方面、已於前日上午十一時舉行會議、討論此項問題、但工部局方面昨日竟予吾認、祇稱對於本案、現正與領事團互相接觸、有準備與日方交涉之意、詎大中社記者昨日下午六時得一可信之消息、謂越界築路警權問題、工部局已於昨晨與日方會議解决、將舊有越界築路警權、歸之工部局、新闢之越界築路警權、歸之僞「市政府、」但一未能證實、僅確知工部局與日方、昨日已正式開始交涉、惟聞日方要求、較之外傳解决方案、相距甚遠、盛傳當局所循爲解决之途徑、爲（一）將越界築路警權重行劃分、何者歸工部局、何者歸僞市政府、」（二）將警權歸工部局、租稅歸僞「市政府、」若如此、必遭中國方面之反對、</p>
<p>偽府企圖迫繳捐稅</p>
<p>自日僞在滬西越界築路一帶佈崗駐守、並調查住戶以後、外間即盛傳僞「市府」方面將强迫該區住戶、向僞府繳納房捐地租、記者頃往詢工部局某高級職員意見、據稱、越界築路居戶之付捐責任、全由居戶自行決定、居戶與工部局方面、僅以納捐而構成契的上之關係、故工部局之所關心者、僅爲繳捐納稅與局方之問題、至第三者能否在該區收得居戶捐稅、非局方所欲過問、凡越界築路居戶之向工部局繳納捐稅者、工部局亦供應以水·電·煤氣·電話·道路等種種市·上之便利、作爲對等之交換、反之、如該區住戶、拒不納稅、則工部局必將該種種市政上之便利、斷絕供給、局方採取此種辦法、無論在滬戰前後、應付不向局方納稅之居戶、均不乏事例、該員又稱、工部局今年上半年中在該區收得之捐稅、僅有五十二萬兀、而爲維持該區市政事業之支出、則為數龐大、遠超收入、且自滬戰爆發以後、工部局在越界築路一帶收捐、即稍感困難、</p>
<p>滬西情勢昨已緩和</p>
<p>滬西越界築路極司非而路愚園路一帶、自九日起、由日僞佈崗駐守以後、軍警來在頻繁、因此謠諑紛起、居民甚形恐慌、惟昨日悄形、已略見和緩、但租界與滬西毘連地帶、則日僞方面戒備仍甚森嚴、茲將大中社記者實地視察悄形、分誌如下、</p>
<p>日兵偽警業已減少</p>
<p>極司非而路十一號慈聯會三十一所、自九日被日偽佔據後、即駐有日憲兵及僞警兵三四十人、但昨日已减至偽警、餘人、日憲兵三四人、門前所置沙袋之旁、本有日僞十餘人布防、昨日僅留僞警叫人駐守、至該屋樓下兩室、已被佔作辦公之用、難民仍照常居住樓上、該室內室地、前曾搭臨時木房、開辦難童中學、現因環境不安、已不能照常上課又極司非而路十五號秋園外駐守之武裝偽警、昨日均已深居室內、不復在外布崗、至康家橋·金家巷·馬路橋一帶、則悄形仍與前日相同、日兵僞警、照常密布路上、</p>
<p>禁止居民搬遷傢具</p>
<p>愚園路叫明別墅及中實新村兩衖門口、各有僞警多名駐守、昨起减爲每衖二人、對出入之人仍不加過問、但不准住戶將傢具雜物等搬出、有圖將物件遷出者、均遭沒收、開納路口佈崗僞警、亦已减爲三名、</p>
<p>捕房警車照常巡邏</p>
<p>靜安寺路一七六〇號上海商儲蓄銀行職員宿舍、於十日被日僞侵佔後、即在門前堆置沙袋、並由日軍僞警佈崗昨日該處沙袋、已增高一倍、惟駐守者僅偽警四名、宿舍內之居客、昨起均已被迫遷出、但隨身物件、尙得自由携出、該宿舍自備之裝送職員大汽車三輛、內開回宿舍、被日僞扣留、開往滬西、至捕房紅色警　車、昨仍在極司非而路曹家渡帶巡邏、日僞軍之往來、已不如前日之頻繁、英軍亦無舉動、住戶尙無遷居之事、</p>
<h3 id="c87">美國對租界問題　讓步有一定限度 <a href="#c87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>日本對美避免衝突</p>
<p>據熟悉租界內悄的某外國人士稱、日來日偽雖在越界築路、增派警察憲兵、並在極司非而路屢佔民房、佈置崗位、形勢頗爲嚴重、然就整個租界地位而論、暫時尙不致發生何種變化、蓋上海爲一國際性之都市、與上海有關之列强、除英法而外、美國實居決定地位、當此英法有事於歐洲之際、日本固可對英法實施壓迫、以換取某種讓步、對租界亦然、但因美國勁立其間、日本在未決心與美國衝突時、實不能不顧慮美國、適可而止、此於日本對於美國始終保持避免衝突之態度、可以見之、</p>
<p>深恐美國加以封鎖</p>
<p>日本對於美國所以如此、推其原故、厥有三端、（一）過去日本對美貿易、年達十三萬萬日元、日本軍用煤油·棉花大部分賴美國供給、而日本生絲·人造絲·等工業品、則以美國爲其最大銷塲、美國一旦對日經濟封鎖、則日本將受致命之打擊、（二）美國經濟力在平時即較日本高出數倍、今日本在長期戰爭疲敝之餘、更不能與美國比擬、日如開罪美國、與美國作戰、以美國海軍之强、勢難一戰而決、而必擴日持久、如此、則美日雙方經濟力既高下懸殊、日本不敗、必無是理、（三）自九一八事變以來、美國對日、即抱厭惡心理、且美國朝野咸抱抵抗侵略之決心、正義呼聲、播於遐邇、美國之在遠東、決不甘願退讓、喪失權益、一如英國週去在歐洲所爲、凡此日本知之最深、故美國突然廢止美日商的、拆散東京英日談判、日本亦不敢有所作爲、反而對美表示好感、</p>
<p>上海問題有所顧忌</p>
<p>今日美國對於上海地位、現已表示其不容加以改變之決心矣、美國務院聲言、美國之在遠東、行動重於言詞、是美國又表示其必以行動堅持其決心矣、故關於上海之前途、可以美國爲基點而推斷之、固然、日本現地軍人對上海租界之進攻、在某一定範圍內、美國尙不致出而干涉、而一任英法去善爲處理、但如日本行動一超　某種限度、妨害租界地位、則美國必當遵守諾言、見諸行動、鼓浪嶼事件、因有美國在內、（鼓浪嶼亦爲英法美共同之租界）、遂在美國推動之下、採取武力政策、使日本不能不放棄武力佔領鼓浪嶼之企圖、前車可鑒、日本之於上海問題、對美國不能不有所顧忌、</p>

<p>英國駐華大使寇爾爵士、於昨日（十日）下午一時十五分、假西人XMHD華美電台、向在華央僑廣播演說、希望在華英僑、在未奉政府訓令以前、各就本位努力、安心職務、爵士並述及彼一九一四年世界大戰本身經歷情形甚詳、茲錄其演說辭如下、</p>
<p>敬向英僑進一忠告</p>
<p>余忝爲英國駐華大使、幸獲此機會、向我在華僑胞、略談數語、余今僅向男子親自發言、抱絕不含有歧視之精神、志在對諸君之需要忠吿者、進一小小忠告而已、而余之所以採用無綫電廣播以代報紙之方法者、乃因捨此以外、別無他法能與僑居中國僻遠地方之諸君接觸也、</p>
<p>如何而后效忠國家</p>
<p>吾人開戰已一週矣、釀成此决戰爭者維何、諸君無不熟諗、無需余贅言、際此時間、當然吾人無不思如何能對國家作最佳之服務、</p>
<p>上次歐戰被阻從戒</p>
<p>當二十五年前、吾人上决開戰時、余自己之情感、今猶未忘、當時余任低級外交官、余最初一念、當然爲從軍、大戰四年中、余被高級當局所阻而不得人伍者、凡三整年、余猶憶當時余反對當局之决心、情緒如何熱烈、及因服從彼等之命令、余之精神、如何沮喪、</p>
<p>熱忱愛國最所佩慰</p>
<p>但掌握余之命運者、確較余更能度量余之用處、常時余雖感痛苦、然事後乃明瞭彼等處置之適當矣、今日諸君多數之感覺、必與余昔年之感覺同、即自問如何能對國家作最佳之服務、並自信宜在行伍中佔一位置是、余可向諸君担保、同情於此種情感、未有人更甚於余、</p>
<p>保持原職　卽屬報國</p>
<p>君垂聽者、諸君之位置、不必眞在行伍中、諸君僑居中國、離戰塲數萬哩之遙、須許多星期、始能返抵本國、而諸君之服役、能見諸實行者、需時更久、諸君多數必願竭汝所能、從速返國、此種願望、旣屬當然、亦堪欣佩、但余不信此係唯一正當辦法、余願聆余言者、牽記諸君之亟欲返國、未必大有裨益於國事、余意諸君中有許多人仍以留居中國、保持原職爲宜、此即對國盡職之最好辦法、以徐待考慮與判定君等服務的特殊適宜之時機</p>
<p>暫時忍耐以待後命</p>
<p>雖最後捨取、　諸君自決、但余所謂「判定君等服務的特殊適宜」之必要機關、刻在成立中、余目前除勸告外、不能有他舉動、但余覺有無待余言者、余之勸吿、係出於完全同悄之精神、而根據於適合情理之判斷是也、故請諸君忍耐、</p>
<p>整個事件正待訓示</p>
<p>並向諸君担報、余所知諸君之忠誠與效勞之殷切、定將爲政府所注意、諸君此種忠誠、政府固所期望、然政府並不因諸君理應具此忠誠、而稍减其欣感、整個事件、余正向倫敦請訓、余意吾人以價待爲是、俾悉我國政府所需者維何、及其所可利用吾人者、以何者爲最適當、</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師著</p>
<p>從國家方面看來，結婚是生育兒女，並施以良善的敎育爲主。從個人方面看來，是爲着營安穩的性慾生活。但是結婚的意義，不僅如此，是重在形成社會的，經濟的，及精神的統一。這種統一，在外，是表現共同的，物質的，彼此利益的生活。在內，是顯示夫婦精神關係的親密。在結婚前，彼此雖要十分同情；可是在結婚後，因性慾生活，而精神關係變爲親密的，也是常事。所以結婚能使男女的精神上肉體上都受到影響，已明白可見。據統計所示，人類的平均壽命，由結婚可以延長。這是因爲結了婚，生活有規則了，養護能周密了，叉加以別的善良的因子的緣故，在各年齡階段，未婚的死亡數，總比已婚的較多。</p>
<p>結婚有益於人體，這是無可吾認的，不過雙方個性不合及有不能生殖的毛病時，應更換其對象，吾則，其害眞不堪設想，爲父母的也必須深深計及。純粹潔白而健全的女子嫁給不堪爲的丈夫，並且不能爲父親的人，這實在是可悲的和失去公道的事。對於民族健康影響很大。</p>
<p>初營結婚生活時，因爲與婚前的孤獨生活完全不同，有時會過分縫綣，縱慾過度，使健康狀態低落，久而久之，腎虧，早洩，遺精，腦弱，失眠等症難免，患此者因性慾的能力减退，夫婦生活不能協調，愛性漸變冷淡，補救之道，端在節慾並從增精補血着手，如在婚前息遺精早洩，腎虧陰萎者亦可用同樣方法，服以德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」即可達到補腎，補血，補精，補腦之功能，該劑爲德國生理學家梅倫博士所發明，供全世界醫師之實騐者，達三千九百餘人，無不認爲治性弱失健的對症良藥，其女用且有調經種子之功，是婦科中之特效良藥。</p>
<p>淋病春秋</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>治療疾患，其功效是吾顯著，不必用宜傳方法可以蒙蔽病家，而應以功效之眞確示人，所謂事實勝於雄辨是也。例如治療淋病之樂，必須合於科學者，才有眞確之功效、原來淋病之爲一般醫家所焦思極慮，要想發明一種特效藥，而終於未能成功。但一般人並不知自己研究成績之失敗，而唱什麼什麼透膜殺菌，局部療法等，皆不過全無實際作用之功效，但因無識者多，遂致僥倖獲到風行一時，然未幾爲事實所擊破，而消聲匿跡良以淋毒菌並非株守前後尿道部分，亦不僅固守粘膜間之老位，牠是一種善於逃竄的下等細菌。到處流竄，故到處亦發炎作痛，變生種種淋病的症狀。如竄入血液而滯於關節者，則變成爲關節炎，竄入泌尿器者，則發生膀胱炎，竄入內生殖器，則發生睪丸炎等，凡淋病之變成此等病狀，十九多被毫無實際功效之淋藥所誤。</p>
<p>獨德國淋病學大師彼德博士，竭畢生之心血發明採用蛋白體黃色素混合製成今日馳名全地球之「克淋儂」一藥，此劑服後，能使全身細胞，發生抗淋噬菌作用，其殺菌力直接達於病灶，凡是有淋菌的地方「克淋儂」殺菌的作用，無不隨之發生，故不論初起之淋病與遠年之淋病，亦不拘男女，皆可服「克淋儂」而可根治之，毫無不良之副作用。在男子外用方面，可用「抗淋水」以洗滌尿道，女子可外用「卡而雪地氏陰道片」爲坐藥則奏功允大。</p>

<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>不論中醫西醫，對咳嗽一症，均屬難治之症，故肺病之多，遠過任何傳染病，而其死亡率，亦實覺驚人也。故一般人不可以爲傷風咳嗽，是一小疾，而不加治療，倘不幸而由咳嗽的不治變爲肺病，則息者亦不應悲觀，其實肺病亦非如一般醫家所說那樣可怕，只要攝生和醫治得法，其他並無神秘，依余經騐所得，「補肺拿爾」一藥，頗有鎮咳治肺之特效，不論病狀二三期之吐血，服此已能絕對根治，然當在治愈時間，宜安靜切勿勞働，並多攝取富有滋養料之食品，則所患允易治愈了，此爲肺癆必愈之條件。</p>

<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>無人不知淋病是一種極司怕的花柳病，但亦有許多人，因其生理上之迫切，或精神上之需要，往往作此冒險之遊戲。結果，恒因此獲致白濁。一經傳染此毒，即有痛苦不堪之病狀發見，如其在此初期遇到庸手劣藥，將病菌內迫，發生種種攝護腺炎，精囊炎等，均爲淋病患者失治後之結果。此等淋毒因其　力極大，如於未治愈前又與妻子接觸，則無罪之妻子，亦受此風流的病患，豈非人間之慘事？故吾恒勸吿一般人對於此病，應該特別留心。否則，闖下彌天大禍，不僅貽害了妻子，而且毀滅了畢生前途之幸福，實堪痛惜。不過在許多塲所，應該知道此病，旣然很難治療，則於初起時卽須赴最有經騐之醫家治療，才免淋病之惡化。</p>
<p>關於一般淋病之療法，大多短視，只耍表面上博得些微功效，卽自吹爲良藥，不知此種成藥，往往因遷延時日，變症益多，措手更難，余二十年來，所遭遇因服市上一般透膜殺菌，及化學療法等藥，所不能治愈者，囑其服用淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，一方更用德國靜電療法及抗淋血淸等，允能使淋病患者，迅奏偉功。百試百騐，從無失敗之例。故狎妓雖爲冒險之遊娛樂，而探醫服藥不愼，允爲險中之險也診時：上午十時至下午六時。自卽日起每天送診二十號每號僅取號金五角。</p>

<h3 id="c133">略論知識份子 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 霖長</p>
<p>知識份子大都出身於小資產階級或小地主資產階級。他們沒有鞏固的經濟基礎，却有着階級的特性。而在地位上，正和一般的小資產者一樣：容易爬上去或跌下來。</p>
<p>因爲他們有着知識，所以在特殊的時代社會中，感覺特別靈敏，以最活躍的姿態出現。他們可以和大衆合流，然而在一般塲合總無意或有意地表露出他們底根性，他們在漫漫的進程中，有時一股勇氣就難以爲繼，於是會落後衰頹甚至退出或叛變：布哈林，托洛斯基，齊諾維愛夫，拉狄克，起先何嘗不是最可敬愛的同志呢，結果他們都在革命史上劃成了另外的一頁。</p>
<p>小資產階級的知識份子又大都工愁善感：看看上層呢，荒淫與無恥，直堪髮指，於是以天下爲己任，毅然決然要担負起自己底神聖的使命來；一等到透入隊伍，則又感到人家太平凡，粗糙，自己工作不能勝任愉快，幾乎相同於在戰塲上的希臘狄莫斯生尼斯（Demosthenes），於是他們彷徨，動搖，流淚，悲嘆，憤怒，成爲孤獨者；然而他們又太看重自己——自己有知識，比一班普通人高超，得天獨厚；因之常常變成爲心理上的個人主義的英雄。自然，這些英雄大都沒有羣衆，所以力量是薄弱的。他們的確是太孤立了，而一部份，在主觀上却又作爲中流砥柱，存着傲氣，不屑淪爲統治層的「附庸」；他們底評價是「潔身自好」。</p>
<p>把自己當然在一般看起來這未嘗不是知識份子的好處；沒志氣的知識份子更會幹着附庸的勾當，像紅樓夢裏賈雨村高吟：「玉在檯中求善價，欽於奩內待時飛一，這豈僅是封建社會士大夫底意識形態，即使現在，一部份還抱着道些名利的思想呢。</p>
<p>這樣，孤獨的知識份子在此塲合，至少也得抱住「潔身自好」了罷？但知識份子正應該有勇氣有信仰，似應不單斤斤於「潔身自好」，那末他們也得從「孤獨」再進一步：從前章太炎氏以大動章作扇墜，臨總統府之門，大詬袁世凱包藏禍心，這眞是血氣的表現，足以大快人心！客觀的效果是有的。然而章氏在那時的力量是孤單的，一個驚雷下，不允許作更大的聲音。爲什麼呢，未始不是遠離了軍衆之故罷。</p>
<p>知識份子應該覺悟，他們底力量得投入大衆的隊伍中：呼吸着大衆的呼吸，行動着大衆的行動。這樣，他們才會理知地克服不良的根性，孤獨的習氣，把自己造成一個時代的戰士。他們有着拜倫底爲自由而戰的正義感是好的，而具備巴比塞感到爲侵略而鬬之非的悟性那末更是聰明，這正是知識份子底優秀卓拔處。</p>
<p>偶然有興念念：「西塞山前白鷺飛，桃花流水鱖魚肥」，這當然也是敏感；但主耍是在如何消滅馮諼式的「食無魚，彈鋏長吟」破落戶知識份子底功利觀；吾則滋長了這樣的毒素，最後會得蹈入「不死遼陽」的覆轍。</p>
<p>其實，知識份子太自重變作個人主義者固然要不得，太自卑成爲失敗主義者則更會埋葬自己。優秀的覺悟的知識份子常是羣衆的正直的領導者，這在歷史已有前例：孫總理和烏利愛諾夫正是兩個模範。他們是不「附庸」——帮閑帮忙帮兇，更不孤獨，更不缺乏勇氣和信仰，而這些確是知識份子最重要的條件；知識份子更因爲有了積極的後二者，他們底理想，感情，行動才會和大家配合，共通，不致跌入深坑，給損碎了，鑽進牛角尖給悶死了。</p>
<h3 id="c134">英勇的伙夫 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>—戰地追記—</p>
<p>在歸途中，獨山失陷了，這惡耗傳到了觀音洞，彼此木然相覰，並且有點莫明其妙起來，「怎麼會丟得這樣快？」似乎是一個無可解答的謎；因爲前綫的工事，做得相當穩固，而守軍願與陣地共存亡的勇氣，我們是親眼看到的，何况附近一帶的地形，非常險峻，有居高臨下之勢，那麼，淪陷的原因，究在那里呢？說來眞使人痛心，當對方的便衣隊，已經在油坊店出現的時候，扼守北面山頭的自衛團，沒有防備，等到從夢中驚醒過來，終於不及「自衛」，給全部解決了。同時，對方又得了當地幽靈的引路，向側面紆迴而入，守軍猝不及防，雖然拚命抵抗，但彈盡援絕，便實踐了他們的誓言，完全壯烈地犧牲了，生還的祇剩了一名伙夫，他把死了的同伴手裏的槍拿過來，射出最後一顆子彈，而且自己的腿部已經掛了『彩』才蛇行躱入深谷，經老百姓救出來。</p>
<p>因此，東线的未能久守，一壞於保安隊的袖手旁觀，再壞於自衛團的放棄責任；至於幽靈的甘爲虎倀，當然也是獨山淪陷的致命傷。但所以引鬼們上門的原因，我們不必諱言，也就是自衛團一手造成的，他們的份子是地痞流氓，沒有訓練，也沒有紀律，至於長官，多半是『綠林好漢』，所謂『大秤分金銀』，便是惟一的中心思想。筆者決不敢誣衊他們，像這樣的冒牌隊伍，不單不能增加抗戰的力量，反而使民衆對於敵我的認識，有時會模糊起來，而削弱軍民合作的動力。廖磊將軍說：「皖西的人民自衛軍，是必須加以澈底的改編的，除了軍事訓練之外，允其要注重政治訓練，然後才能够成爲眞正的民衆武力，把保衛家鄉的重担放到他們的肩上去，便勝任愉快了。」廖將軍這幾句話語，後來是果然做到了。</p>
<p>我們跟伙夫會見的那天，他靜靜地睡在山城東郊的醫院中，創傷已經合口了，但臉色仍是灰白的，這是流血太多的緣故。談話之後，知道他呌張才勝，河北涿縣人。「家？請不要問我這個吧！在魔鬼們沒有退出國境以前，我什麼都不要，家，這個累人的東西！」他憤慨地答復着，睜大了一對暴眼睛。接着，他表示等到醫生允許他離院，便馬上去歸隊，給已死的同伴復仇。</p>
<p>「好吧，勇敢的朋友，祝你永遠勝利，再會！」</p>
<p>他微笑地仲出一隻堅硬的手來，跟我們緊緊地握着。</p>

<p>— 徐野</p>
<p>花</p>
<p>淸晨，在案頭上發現了一枝燦爛的鮮花。</p>
<p>誰送來這一技花呢？</p>
<p>聽飄過深巷裏賣花女的呌喊聲，我明白了：花是她送來的。</p>
<p>往昔，我愛花，我喜歡嗅吸着花的幽香。如今，我變了，一株鮮麗的玫瑰或一朶嬌艷的茉莉，它已不能刺激我底心了。</p>
<p>案頭是零亂的：那裏陳列着書本，詩稿，筆桿，這一切似乎太單調罷，必需添上一把花，配成一種美的調和的圖案。</p>
<p>可是，從枝頭採下來的花朶已褪失了珍奇與希罕，它或許有着彩色，但沒有像一滴血般鮮紅，活潑！</p>
<p>我肯定：鮮血一定會結成美麗的奇葩，它是世界上最珍貴的東西，單調的案顛要是有了這，那就有生氣了。於是我希望或人能够綴着幾朶從前綫帶回來。我眞要受到絕大的啟示呢，我需將注貫着生命。</p>
<p>我曉得我祇在痴想：天下沒有這樣現成；鮮血的奇葩要讓勇敢的戰士來造成，會送給孤獨者當作案頭的點綴嗎？</p>
<p>但我終於留着一張紙條在門外；寫着：</p>
<p>『明天的花不要送來。』</p>
<p>此後，賣花女來了，只能悄悄地無言回去。</p>
<p>家書</p>
<p>是海燕掠過海濤，一紙迢遙的家書剪斷了一片思念。</p>
<p>家嘗，一字一意，說不盡的兩地鄉音，遠隔了雲山河海，我有極度的欣慰。</p>
<p>望不到故鄉的面目，信說：家園被蹂躪了，烽火遍野，田地在鐵路下變成焦土，可是，那山巒，那層峯，飄揚起我們偉大的旗，游擊的隊伍行進着，大家正在苦鬥中。</p>
<p>讀完了家書，依依不捨地，把它唸熱了，不讓每一字眼輕易忘却的，也許，似乎以前有位詩人說過：『家書抵萬金，』現在，我很愛讀這一句，就算它是萬金的代價吧。</p>
<p>懷念了遠方握着槍桿的友朋：金，能，琪——他們着上戎裝，冒着嶺東的風雨，奔馳於家鄉的隴畝間，一頭顧，一桿槍！我預祝他們好，他們的康强，家鄉的來日當然屬於我們的。</p>
<p>我將用無限的熱力去報答友朋底艱辛的掙扎，我要工作</p>
<p>再度等候着第二封的家嘗，翹首望着了無盡長的天和海……</p>
<h3 id="c137">吿別 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>

<h3 id="c138">崔靈芝十三旦軼聞兩則 <a href="#c138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<p>—兩伶於淸末均到上海</p>
<p>崔靈芝十三旦（侯俊山）均係三十年前之名梆子旦，淹逝已久，似無追記之價値，惟當崔侯兩伶蜚聲歌樹，鋒鋩甚盛，無異今日之梅蘭芳。李蒓客「越縵堂日記」，載京中內務大臣文錫宴恭邸至夜半，不肯罷，必欲召西伶十三旦演兩齣，屬宛平令促速來，言未畢，而十三旦適至，萬尙書即離席膝坐爲媚態以迎之，曰汝來何遲，幾得罪於從者，幸勿怪，速上妝以慰飢渴，時事如此，朝庭何以自存？我曹無死所矣：李蒓客之感慨若此，亦可證十三旦見重於淸室大臣之狀矣。又某筆記志崔靈芝事，謂某京官風流種子，誤崔伶爲像姑，邀士流多人宴於酒館，席終客散，靈芝猶未去，某京官於座間欲施輕薄，崔伶遽饗以掌頰，拂袖而去，以上軼聞兩則，由戲迷讀之，必以爲甚趣。</p>
<p>崔靈芝與十三旦在民國以前，均先後到滬演唱，而兩人所携配角，愚獨能記憶爲馬全祿劉增義兩伶，其餘配角尙有何人，則不敢妄測矣。左畹生著「粉墨叢談」紀十三旦曰：十三旦以艷名噪燕台，都人糜然從風，爭相傾倒，冠裳裙屐，座上常盈，旣復航洵來申，在丹桂茶園登塲，其新安驛，眞令人又驚又愛，不數月，乃重返都門，近則一片飛花，又不知流向天涯何處矣。嗟乎其可復見乎？按粉墨叢談一書，其自序中載光緒歲在强圉大淵獻陬月望日，以客中案頭無爾雅可檢，但侯俊山之在光緒年間來滬，確已見諸前人著述矣。又辛亥年，愚忘年友汪君翰臣，由漢皋避亂至吾鄉，賃一屋與愚爲鄰，飯後輒爲愚談菊部中事，其人本旗籍，久居滬漢兩地，吿愚以崔靈芝某年（指民國以前）在滬演其得意佳作忠義俠，汪君謂生平聽歌從未垂淚，獨對崔伶所演，爲之淚下云云。十三旦於民國後似曾重來海上一决，其地似爲丹桂第一臺也。海上不乏年尊顧曲周郞，見期文後，必有能指示兩伶來滬之年者，亦梨園掌故之一證也。</p>
<h3 id="c139">張翼鵬金素琴合作？ <a href="#c139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— 太白</p>
<p>—新都飯店將組平劇塲</p>
<p>這兩天外間盛傳着一個奇突的消息——張翼鵬和金素琴合作的新聞。</p>
<p>金素琴自上月返上海後，深居簡出，和外界很少往來，一則玉體違和，休息休息，再則金素琴不忍放棄改良平劇的初衷，而在上海搭班，暫時沒有滿意的地盤。如林樹森的林劇團在更新上演，本來亦有和金素琴合作的消息，但終究不能成爲事實。那末，這兩天盛傳的和張翼鵬合作的消息，是從何而起的呢？</p>
<p>原來新都飯店開幕之初，除玻璃電臺，筱文濱申曲塲之外，本計劃組織一個比較有號召力的平劇塲，曾有許多戲班中人向當局開過「名單」，但不是過於理想，便是聲望不够。最近猴王張翼鵬在大舞臺辭班出來，張翼鵬唱了三十多本「西遊記」，在上海的觀衆腦膜上已留着深刻的印象，就或許有人動他的腦筋，同時也轉到金素琴的身上，如果他們倆能够合作，在「生意眼」上確實十分有把握的。但這也是過於理想的計劃，實現的成份是很少的，不過新都飯店現在要組織一個平劇塲，看來是很迫切了。</p>
<h3 id="c140">明星演話劇　誰說不應該？ <a href="#c140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— 小玉</p>
<p>辣斐這次演「日出」舞臺戲，有許多是銀幕上的朋友，如陸露明，藍蘭，周曼華，白燕，舒適，龔稼農，周起，白雲諸人，據說有許多專幹話劇的同志，有點搖頭，認爲　動，太覺自由，而跡近粗俗以「電影明星」的頭銜來做話劇的幌子是不足爲訓的。</p>
<p>這是理由，不過只是一半，我以爲：話劇固不必硬以電影明星爲幌子，但一成了銀幕演員，他（她）斷然不能因此而喪失了上舞臺的權利。總之，凡有演戲天才者，則不論已否上過銀幕，我們都不必歧視。</p>
<p>看過「日出」，覺得陸露明舒適龔稼農周憂華諸人，都有可取的舞臺演技，而「銀幕新人」藍蘭，更不能以上了舞臺對之摒棄，這是區區之見。</p>

<p>過後我同信芳研究，我說這個人太奇怪了，他本人是以二黃靑衣票友馳名於平津的，目個既不以笛名世，又沒聽說他精於崑曲，然而他却願拿出錢來造就許多笛師，並且還把一位姓沈的白養活在家裹，這實在有些莫名其妙呀！當時信芳答道：「從前嘗聽周五實說過，說我們同行中（崑班）有一人曾經到了關外，起先弄些古董發了點財，攻養兒子在大學畢了業，如今聽說已經作了很大的官很闊綽了。」我聽了信芳的這段話，再和他仔細研究那日席間某市長所發的高論，乃不由異口同聲的說道：「所謂某笛師的　兒子，要不然別就是他吧。」</p>

<h3 id="e1">German Attacks Repelled by Polish Forces; Intense Fighting 6 Miles Outside Warsaw; 70 German Planes Bomb Warsaw 15 Times in One Day; Large Polish Reinforcements Sent to Front Lines to Defend Both Rivers <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>London: The Polish Embassy here has just announced that Warsaw is still held by our troops (Havas dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>Paris: The mayor of Warsaw telegraphed from the city today that fighting is taking place 6 miles outside Warsaw, that German attacks have been repelled, and that Polish morale is very high (Reuters dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>Paris: According to reliable sources, the resistance of Polish troops on the Vistula and San River front lines has been strengthened, and a large number of reserves are available for reinforcement (Havas dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>London: A communiqué issued last night from the Warsaw radio station by the Polish General Staff stated that the German forces approaching Warsaw have been repelled. According to various sources, Polish troops are desperately defending Warsaw, indicating that Warsaw is still completely under Polish control. German reports are not credible (Reuters dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>Warsaw: Colonel Lipiński, Chief of Staff of the Warsaw Defense Command, broadcast a message at 10:30 PM tonight, stating that Warsaw was bombed by German planes no less than 15 times today, but a total of 16 German planes were shot down (Havas dispatch, 10th).</p>
<p>Paris: A reporter for a French newspaper claimed that Warsaw Garrison Commander Lipiński announced that Warsaw was bombed 14 times by 70 German planes on Sunday, and 15 of them were shot down by the Polish side (Reuters dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>Hungarian Capital: According to Warsaw radio broadcasts, German troops shelled Warsaw all day yesterday and conducted 14 air raids. However, as of last night, Warsaw had not fallen. During the air raids, Polish anti-aircraft artillery shot down 15 German planes, five of which crashed within the city. Many houses in Warsaw were hit by incendiary bombs and caught fire. Polish troops 50 kilometers from Warsaw at Merymont are making every effort to resist the fierce German attacks. Two German tanks were destroyed by Polish forces. According to the latest reliable information from the Polish front, Polish defense forces have completed their planned defense lines on the Narew, Bug, and Vistula rivers, allowing Polish forces to form a long line of resistance in northeastern Poland (Associated Press dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>Paris: According to news from here today, Polish troops are now concentrated along the Vistula River in the northern suburbs of Warsaw. Germans attempting to cross the river have been wiped out by Polish forces. It is also reported that there was terrible fighting all night last night in the northern suburbs of Warsaw, with Polish resistance being very successful. According to the Polish side, the German mechanized units' momentum has decreased compared to the past due to the lengthening of their rear transportation lines (Associated Press dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>Beijing: This morning, Berlin radio broadcast a German war report stating that the great battle in Poland has reached a decisive point. Polish forces in the south are resisting German advances but have been forced by German forces to retreat across the San River. Recent news has confirmed that the two armies are now fighting 5 miles from Warsaw. According to Polish news received here, the German forces advancing northeast from Krakow have now stopped. The German forces in that area seem to be exhausted, and the morale of the Polish forces has not declined (Reuters dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>Berlin: According to news from here today, the battle for Warsaw is now raging fiercely in the northeast and southwest of Warsaw. This battle could determine the overall situation of the war. The Bug River has become the last line of defense northeast of Warsaw, and German forces are currently building bridges over the river in preparation for crossing. The fighting between the Narew and Bug rivers is still extremely fierce, indicating that German forces have not yet gained a foothold there. To the southwest of Warsaw, a larger-scale battle is taking place in the area from the Łódź-Warsaw railway north to Sandomierz on the Vistula River. A German army advancing northwest has been out of contact for several days and is now reported to have reached 55 miles west of Warsaw, on the north bank of the Vistula River. It is reported that many Polish troops remain in the area it passed through, preventing it from advancing rapidly. The current German plan to attack Warsaw is to encircle it on three sides: one route advancing south from the Bug River, a second route advancing towards Warsaw from the northeast across the Vistula River, and a third route advancing towards Warsaw from the south. The German side views the war situation optimistically (Associated Press dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>Paris: According to Polish sources here today, although Warsaw is now within range of German long-range artillery, German forces are still being held back in the suburbs. Although street fighting has begun there, German forces have repeatedly been repelled. In short, Warsaw has now become a fortress, similar to Madrid during the Spanish Civil War (Associated Press dispatch, 11th).</p>

<p>Berlin: The German military announced that the important Polish naval base of Gdynia is still under siege. The German navy is assisting the German army, shelling Polish artillery positions and bombing Gdynia port. The German air force continues to bomb the railways and highways east and northeast of Warsaw, as well as the railways and highways near Kulm and Lublin, with the aim of dispersing Polish troops moving along the routes. The western railway station in Kulm has been destroyed (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>Berlin: A communiqué was issued here last night stating that the "Swedish Evening News" published a report that the German air force dropped 200 incendiary bombs on Warsaw, but an investigation has proven this report to be completely false (Haitong dispatch, 11th).</p>

<p>London: The German-Polish front line is 250 miles long, starting from Pozik on the Bug River, 30 miles north of Warsaw, reaching the outskirts of Warsaw, then from the outskirts of Warsaw to Łódź, then from Łódź to Sandomierz, and from there to Krakow. So far, Poland has lost one-third of its land. The greatest blow to Poland is the loss of the industrial area. The fall of Krakow gives the German army a base on the east bank of the Vistula River, while simultaneously thwarting the Polish army's plan to gain a foothold in this area, which is even more unfavorable. At the same time, the German army can advance northeast from here and attack the flanks of the Polish army. The fall of the industrial center of Łódź is another blow to Poland. According to reliable sources, Germany has mobilized 50 divisions, totaling 850,000 troops, for this campaign. Another 20 divisions have recently been added, so the number of German troops currently on the battlefield has reached 1.2 million (Associated Press dispatch, 11th).</p>
<h3 id="e4">Germans Are Suffering; Still Unaware of the Opening of the Western Front <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>Danzig: A reporter for a certain newspaper stationed in Berlin cabled that the first German communiqué on the Western Front was broadcast nationwide yesterday, causing a great impression on the general public. Most Germans are completely unaware that war has broken out on the Western Front and still hope that conflict can be avoided on that front (Reuters dispatch, 11th).</p>
<h3 id="e5">British and French Reporters Talk About the Situation in Poland <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>Cernăuți, Romanian Border: A Reuters special correspondent, after withdrawing from Warsaw, arrived at the Romanian border at night in a British Embassy car full of embassy staff. He gave a detailed account of the wartime situation in Poland. Most of the British evacuees were women. The journey from Warsaw to here took three and a half days, and air raid alerts were frequent along the way. The correspondent said that the speed of the German advance was unexpected. Although the Polish people are suffering, their morale has not been shattered, and they are proud that the Polish army is fighting against overwhelming odds. They are confident that the British and French armies will be victorious on the Western Front. The most disturbing aspect of the situation is the German advance from Slovakia, which threatens the Bug and Vistula River lines. However, the Polish command is confident that it can put up a long-term resistance there. The British and French ambassadors arrived at the temporary capital of Lublin, southeast of Warsaw, on Tuesday, but upon learning that the area was difficult to defend, they immediately packed up and headed to an area in the Pinsk region (Reuters dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>Romanian Capital: A Havas correspondent stationed in Warsaw has arrived in Romania from Poland. He reported that one-third of the entire journey, namely the section from Warsaw to Lublin, had only one railway line, which had been heavily bombed by German planes. Major military locations were also frequently subjected to air raids. Consequently, traffic between Poland and Romania and Hungary has been affected and is extremely slow. In addition, numerous German planes bombed various Polish highways with small bombs continuously from 7:00 PM on the 5th of this month to noon on the 7th. As a result, the transport of wounded soldiers from the western front to Lviv in the east and the transport of troops and military equipment to Warsaw were greatly delayed. Polish authorities have sent a large number of workers to repair the damage in shifts, and they have been able to restore it quickly. In short, the German army's vehicles and equipment are superior, which is detrimental to Poland. Fortunately, the morale of the country is high, and it can continue to resist as before. As for the Western Front, residents of the German border area have been evacuated to Stuttgart and Frankfurt after the French army began its offensive. Polish citizens are extremely excited upon hearing this news. Although the country's communiqués admit to military setbacks, the public is not discouraged (Havas dispatch, 11th).</p>
<h3 id="e6">Report of Warsaw's Fall Last Night Was a German Fabrication; Although It Is Difficult to Predict What Will Happen to the City, the Polish Army's Determination to Resist Has Been Clearly Demonstrated <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>Lviv, Southeastern Poland: The General Headquarters has just released a war report stating that German troops have retreated from the outskirts of Warsaw. The radio station there is still broadcasting as usual, but various German radio stations are impersonating the station's call sign and broadcasting false war reports. The so-called German occupation of Warsaw is one such fabrication. Listeners everywhere should pay attention (Havas dispatch, 11th).</p>
<p>London: The Ministry of Information released a message stating that anyone listening to foreign broadcasts may have heard an announcement in Polish on Friday night that Warsaw had been captured by German forces. This message was retransmitted yesterday by a radio station 15 miles outside Warsaw. Last night, the Polish Ambassador to the UK stated that although the German side claimed that German troops had entered Warsaw, they had not yet done so. This information was confirmed by a broadcast from the Polish government radio station in Warsaw itself. Fighting is currently intense, making it difficult to obtain accurate information about the German attack on Poland. However, several things are very clear: the Polish army is bravely resisting a superior enemy, the morale of the Polish soldiers is extremely high, and the retreat is orderly. Göring admitted in a broadcast yesterday that Germany had to mobilize 70 divisions of troops to invade Poland. Although the German army's manpower and weapons are far superior to those of the Polish army, the Polish army is still able to retreat in an orderly manner without panic. All observers should admire this. In this initial stage of the war, it is difficult to predict the fate of Warsaw, but the Polish army has displayed its courage and determination to resist, which is already a clear fact (Reuters dispatch, 11th).</p>
<h3 id="e7">Britain Implements Restrictions on Trade with the Soviet Union; Soviet Union Considers It an Unfriendly Act <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Moscow: Soviet newspapers have been repeatedly publishing news of unfriendly acts by Britain towards the Soviet Union. It is claimed that as of the end of August, Soviet commercial organizations in the UK have encountered many incidents detrimental to Anglo-Soviet commercial relations. For example, the British firm Henry Bley stopped manufacturing four pressing beds ordered by the Soviet Machine Import Bureau. The Azitier firm refused to ship ten machines that had already been manufactured to the Soviet Union, notifying the Soviet consignee that the British government had requisitioned the batch of machines. The Parkinson firm also refused to ship ordered machines to the Soviet Union, claiming that it was under orders from the British government. The Herbert firm not only refused to ship 27 machines that had already been inspected by the Soviet receiving representative but also refused to explain the reasons for breaching the contract. Churchill and Oakhad, two firms, unilaterally canceled contracts for three and fourteen machines, respectively, that had been ordered by Soviet import agencies. The Soviet Commercial Representation in the UK has collected a lot of evidence regarding this type of contract breach and bad faith by British firms and has repeatedly appealed to British government agencies, but to no avail. The British Board of Trade has also refused to issue export permits for 855 tons of rubber that has been paid for by the Soviet side and is waiting to be shipped at the docks, despite repeated requests. Furthermore, the Soviet commercial representative's request to transfer 1,000 tons of coffee beans purchased to the Soviet ship "Gransea" from a British ship has been fruitless for many days. The actions of the aforementioned British firms and British government agencies have fundamentally undermined Anglo-Soviet commercial relations (TASS dispatch, 10th).</p>
<h3 id="e8">Britain and France Are Also Engaging in a War of Attrition Against Germany; Once the War Starts, It Cannot Be Stopped; German Illusions Are Gradually Disappearing <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>London: The British government announced last night that it has taken various measures to prepare for three years of war. Commentators here said that even if Poland is defeated, Germany should not expect a peaceful settlement. The British government's statement last night was intended to warn Germany of this and at the same time to ensure that world opinion does not expect German politics to collapse in the short term. In short, after the war against Germany begins, a long-term plan must be made to succeed. The British people are well aware that this war must be fought to the end, and therefore they can remain calm about the evolution of the situation. People in diplomatic circles say that the British government's statement yesterday was not intended to speculate about the future of the war. Its purpose was to prove Britain's determination to engage in a war of attrition and that it has taken all necessary measures to achieve final victory (Havas dispatch, 10th).</p>
<p>Paris: Diplomatic figures here have recently stated that the German side originally hoped that the current war could be localized. This illusion seems to be gradually disappearing. This can be seen from the fact that German radio stations only briefly mentioned the contact on the Western Front in their broadcasts today. General Göring, the country's Minister of Aviation, also delivered a speech to workers at a munitions factory in Berlin yesterday. His intention was to inform domestic workers that the scope of the war may expand and that its duration will be longer than expected. In fact, this situation has already been understood in various neutral countries. However, the so-called neutral countries are worth studying. The general public regards all countries that have not participated in the war as neutral countries. In fact, these countries can be divided into three categories. The neutral status of Switzerland and Belgium has been recognized by various countries in accordance with international law, which is the first category. Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Romania are bound by current treaties and are closer to certain countries than others. They are also avoiding involvement in the vortex, which is the second category. In addition, there are other countries that believe that their interests are not affected by the positions taken by the belligerent countries and therefore maintain neutrality, which is the third category. However, the attitude of this type of country is not based on fixed principles but on circumstances. Germany's claim that the war against Poland can be localized is probably alluding to this type of country (Havas dispatch, 10th).</p>
<h3 id="e9">Soviet Union Feels Threatened; Makes Every Effort to Strengthen National Defense; Formally Announces Mobilization of Reserves <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>Moscow: Several grades of Soviet reserves have been ordered to mobilize in the military districts of the Ukrainian Republic, the Belarusian Republic, Leningrad, Moscow, Kalinin, and Orel. This has been formally announced by government authorities. In addition, all recruits of the 1919 grade, half of the recruits of the 1918 grade, young people of the 1920 and 1921 grades who have graduated from secondary school, and reserves of grades before 1918 who have obtained permission to defer service have all been ordered to enlist in the military immediately. Government authorities have also explained this military measure, stating that the scope of the war between Germany and Poland is expanding daily and the threat it contains is becoming increasingly critical. Therefore, the government has to take various measures to strengthen national defense. In various places, people have gathered in front of various shops, scrambling to buy white sugar, flour, kerosene, tobacco, and other items as a precaution. Some people also said, "Although we have made peace with the German leader Hitler, it is also possible that we may be forced to fight him one day." In short, according to foreign observers here, it is difficult to know what the true intentions of the Soviet authorities are. However, for the time being, it should be noted that the Soviet Union has not yet declared neutrality regarding the war between Germany and Poland. In addition, after Czechoslovakia was occupied by Germany, the country's ambassador to the Soviet Union has not left and still enjoys diplomatic privileges. Although the authorities have denied recent rumors that the Soviet government no longer recognizes the ambassador, the ambassador's car no longer flew the Czech flag when he went out today, so the saying that the Czech state is no longer recognized is rife again (Havas dispatch, 1st).</p>
<p>Moscow: Moscow, which is generally regarded by observers as the safest capital in Europe, no longer presents a peaceful appearance. The number of spectators in theaters and cinemas is quite sparse, and there are fewer vehicles on the road than usual, as most vehicles have been requisitioned by the military commission. There are many people queuing quietly in front of various food stores and savings banks waiting to enter (Reuters dispatch, 11th).</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3 id="e11">An Overview of the Sino-Japanese War Situation <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>As the European situation escalated from extreme tension to outright war, the world's attention has become focused on the European theater. As a result, the recent developments in the Sino-Japanese conflict have been overshadowed by the dramatic changes occurring internationally. However, they still cannot be ignored. Because China is an integral part of world politics, and China's resistance war can be regarded as the precursor to the worldwide "anti-aggression" war, we must not lose sight of this fundamental significance by focusing solely on the European situation. We can see that the British Foreign Secretary has solemnly declared that their Far East policy will not change, that both Japan and the Soviet Union deny having concluded a non-aggression pact, and that the United States is strengthening its defenses in the Far East. Furthermore, the Chongqing National Government has solemnly declared that its two-year-long, relentless policy of resistance will be maintained to the end. On the Japanese side, their new Prime Minister Abe has also stated, "Some people believe that the European war will provide Japan with an opportunity to easily resolve the China issue, but this is a great misconception." All of these developments indicate that the Sino-Japanese conflict has not diminished in importance due to the European war. Therefore, the development of the Sino-Japanese war situation should still be closely monitored.</p>
<p>Looking at the overall situation of the Sino-Japanese war, since mid-July, all fronts have been in a state of stalemate. The more significant engagements occurred in Shanxi Province, and the focus of the fighting in Shanxi is divided between western Shanxi and southeastern Shanxi. The fighting in western Shanxi has intensified since the beginning of this month, with Japanese troops retreating from the Fenyang-Xiaoyi line back towards the Lishi-Zhongyang line, and attacking Liulin, attempting to cross the Yellow River and advance into the Eighth Route Army's base area in Yan'an. According to a Chongqing dispatch on the 7th, Zhu De has personally gone to the front to command the battle. At the same time, tens of thousands of Chinese troops from Shaanxi Province have been crossing the river in successive days, indicating that another bloody battle is about to unfold. In southeastern Shanxi, the fighting remains stalled in the Changzhi, Changzi, Huguan, and Lucheng areas. Chinese troops are employing mobile warfare tactics, inflicting heavy blows on the Japanese army. They are also taking advantage of heavy rains to operate with great agility, while the Japanese army is unable to deploy effectively. Cheng Qian, the director of the Northwest Headquarters, has flown to southern Shanxi to command 100,000 Chinese troops crossing the Yellow River from the southern bank, creating a formidable force. Overall, the current situation in Shanxi Province shows that the Japanese army is under triple pressure from weather, terrain, and manpower. While the pressure from terrain and manpower was within the Japanese army's calculations, the prevalence of natural disasters was unexpected. Recent heavy flooding in North China has turned the entire Hebei Province, as well as northern Henan and western Shandong, into a vast swamp. Heavy rains in southern Shanxi have also completely destroyed major transportation lines, causing difficulties for the Japanese army in terms of supplies, and substantial losses in terms of equipment and military stores. Since the Hongdong-Guluo highway was completely destroyed by the Chinese army, the only transportation line running through southeastern Shanxi is now entirely under Chinese control. Prolonged delays in this area could lead to the Japanese army being defeated piecemeal by the Chinese. According to a Reuters dispatch from northern Tianjin on the 10th, most of the Japanese troops in southern Shanxi have retreated and are heading towards the three northeastern provinces. This suggests that the Japanese army has abandoned southern Shanxi and is only seeking to maintain control of northern Shanxi and the railway between Shijiazhuang and Taiyuan. Having abandoned southern Shanxi, even if the Japanese army in western Shanxi were able to cross the Yellow River, they would not dare to venture deep inland alone. This shows that the war situation in Shanxi can be stabilized for the time being, and the Japanese attempt to overturn the Eighth Route Army's base area, as well as to cut off Sino-Soviet communications, has been proven to be a pipe dream by the facts.</p>
<p>In addition, in Guangdong, Chinese troops in the northeast of the two rivers have launched a counterattack, besieging Zengcheng and pressing on Conghua. Chao'an has been recaptured, and Jiangmen and Xinhui are under control. The activity of Chinese guerrillas in various areas such as southern Hebei, Jiaodong, northern Jiangsu, and southern Jiangsu proves the failure of the Japanese army's so-called mopping-up operations. The situation in northern Hubei is quiet. There are only localized skirmishes in southern Hubei, northern Henan, eastern Henan, eastern Fujian, and the South China Sea.</p>
<p>From a military point of view, each regional battle has its own mission, and no area can be neglected. However, from the perspective of a certain period and a certain stage, there is a distinction between the important and the less important. Currently, the most noteworthy center of attention is no longer western Shanxi, but central Hubei. According to an Associated Press dispatch from Chongqing on the 8th, "According to military experts here, the Japanese seem to be planning a final decisive offensive in Hubei in September and October, in an attempt to end the war quickly. Their offensive route can be divided into two: first, along the Han River, through Xiangyang and Fancheng, to Lahekou, then westward to spy on Hanzhong, and then northward to reach Xi'an, while also threatening the highway communications to Chengdu. Second, to cross the Han River and spy on Jiangling and Yichang, controlling the navigation of the Yangtze River, while also subjecting Chongqing to continuous air raids by Japanese aircraft."</p>
<p>"According to reliable sources, the Japanese are currently preparing 50 gunboats for an attack on Shashi and Yichang... The army is also launching simultaneous offensives on land. The Japanese army in western Hubei has now increased by one division... and is also planning to transfer troops from Japan to China for reinforcement."</p>
<p>According to reports from colleagues, the Chinese army in central China has also been busy preparing for war for several days, with more than 300,000 fresh troops arriving on both banks of the Yangtze River. A major battle is brewing. It is worth remembering that in April of this year, the Japanese army also launched an offensive into central Hubei to spy on Sichuan and Shaanxi, but the result was a disastrous failure due to a light force advancing westward and its lines of communication being cut off by the Chinese army. This was the famous battle of the Dabie Mountains. Now, the target of Japan's so-called new offensive remains in this area, and the Chinese army is also recuperating and sharpening its swords, preparing for a fierce battle that is not far off. We will not make any judgments about the gains and losses at that time for now. We will try to speculate on the military strategy. If the Chinese army wants to defend western Henan and southern Shaanxi to the north, it must hold Xiangyang and Fancheng. If it wants to protect Hunan to the south and Sichuan to the west, it must also hold Jiangling and Yichang. Of the two, the gain or loss of Xiangyang and Fancheng is undoubtedly the most important. Because the Yangtze River has the danger of the Three Gorges, the Japanese army will certainly not dare to advance by water. It must first gain a foothold on the east bank of the Han River, so the area between Xiangyang and Fancheng is an important battlefield. As for Jiangling and Yichang, the Japanese army must have a strong force in Hunan to echo each other before attacking. However, the Japanese army in eastern Hunan has repeatedly suffered defeats, and is confined to a corner, only protecting Yueyang, and is really unable to do anything. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese army's strategy is still to attack Xiangyang and Fancheng as the main objective, and Jiangling and Yichang as the auxiliary. On the Chinese side, defenses have long been established step by step along the west bank of the Han River. If the Japanese army goes upstream, it will be extremely difficult to succeed. If it goes by road, although there are Xianghua to the east of Xiangyang, and Zhongxiang to the west, the Xianghua road passes through the central mountains, and the Chinese army can intercept and attack by relying on the terrain. The Zhongxiang road has the Han River separating it, and the Japanese army cannot easily fly across it. Furthermore, if you enter southern Shaanxi from Xiangyang to the west, the area west of Lahekou is all mountainous. Although there are several roads leading from Hanzhong to Sichuan, they are all steep mountain roads. The success or failure of a risky advance is really unknown. We will not say for the time being that China's opportunity to win a great victory is at hand, but China's possibility of winning a victory is indeed greater than that of Japan. To take a step back, if Japan attempts to end the Sino-Japanese war with this decisive new offensive, then Japan will inevitably be disappointed unless the Japanese army is defeated and returns in defeat. Japan must launch a hundred decisive new offensives, a hundred complete victories, before there is hope of ending the war. China only needs to prepare for one complete victory out of a hundred decisive battles to have a chance to clean up the situation!</p>

<p>Paris - The Petit Parisien reports that over the past 24 hours, German troops have been fiercely resisting along the entire line to prevent the French advance. The Germans have recaptured one position previously taken by the French. There have been no changes to the French front lines. Enemy counterattacks have repeatedly failed to affect the French line. It is reported that German artillery has been retaliating heavily, indicating that French troops have penetrated the Siegfried Line. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Zurich, Switzerland - German radio announced in a broadcast at 5 PM today that French troops on the Western Front have made contact with German forces in front of the Siegfried Line. (Note: This is the first time the German side has admitted to contact.) (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris - The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 14 tonight, stating, "As a result of our army's steady and cautious advance, we have made progress in the Saar region and the Vosges Mountains. The enemy launched an offensive east of the Moselle River, northeast of the town of Sielck. Our aircraft continued reconnaissance flights today. The British and French navies laid mines in the English Channel and certain areas of the North Sea." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris - The General Headquarters issued War Bulletin No. 15, stating, "Last night was calm; our troops made local gains." Semi-official sources elaborated, stating, "Our army is gradually advancing on the western front in Germany. After reinforcing the forward troops, the enemy began a counterattack. The front line spans 50 kilometers, so the fighting there has become more intense than before. However, in two-thirds of the area, our army is still able to advance smoothly. In certain locations, progress is slower because the enemy is stubbornly defending. The struggle for positions that can be used as artillery emplacements is particularly fierce. Looking back on the achievements of the past few days of combat, our army has successively captured many hills, towns, and strategic strongholds. Therefore, our position is quite advantageous. The slogan adopted by our General Staff seems to be 'Safety First.' Therefore, every time a position is captured, it is first reinforced to ensure that the enemy cannot recapture it, thereby implementing a steady and cautious strategy." (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>London - The Ministry of Information announced that it has received wireless messages from various parts of the world reporting on actions against German submarines. Some of these actions have been successful. The Ministry of Information also announced that the British ship Magda Po, carrying 1,800 tons of military supplies, has been sunk. There were minor casualties. Other British ships that have been lost include the Rio Claro of the Thom Shipping Company, weighing 4,086 tons, sunk on September 6th, and the Hudu of the Whistle Company, weighing 5,000 tons, sunk on September 8th. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>London - The Ministry of Information issued a statement saying that since the British Navy has taken various measures to deal with enemy submarines and mine-laying ships, the Navy has not yet announced what results have been achieved. However, it is well known that our warships are actively searching for enemy ships in all seas around the world, especially in the seas near Britain, to protect imperial shipping routes. The naval authorities will also implement merchant ship escort measures in the short term, at which time the sinking of our ships by the enemy can be eliminated. The reason why these measures could not be implemented immediately after the outbreak of the war is that our warships were originally scattered in various seas and could not be properly deployed in a short period of time. In short, in the past week, apart from the active operations of our destroyers and mine-laying ships, no large-scale naval battles have occurred. (Havas, 10th)</p>

Remedial measures are being taken in Westphalia and the Ruhr region, namely: (1) canceling Sunday holidays without compensation, (2) canceling the bonus system and not providing additional compensation for overtime work, and (3) absolutely prohibiting wage increases. This is considered to be of great significance here. It can be seen that Germany's economy has already encountered difficulties. (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>Paris - Finance Minister Reynaud delivered a speech to the nation by radio tonight, saying, "The military front is of utmost importance, needless to say, but the economic, financial, and monetary fronts in the rear are also related to the survival of the nation, and are as important as the military. As for Germany, it has exhausted all its efforts to prepare for war for a long time, so it is exhausted. Its position in the economic and financial aspects is extremely fragile, and there are no 'fresh troops' to be transferred and replenished. Looking back at our country, the situation is far better than theirs. Since last year, our country's production has increased dramatically, and our gold reserves have increased by nearly 30% in recent months. The weight of gold stored in the Bank of France, measured in tons, is double that of 1914, and this does not include the gold held by the Exchange Equalization Fund or the foreign currency held by the people. To shorten the period of killing the enemy and achieving results, and to reduce the sacrifice of national lives, it all depends on this gold." Also, in 1914, the amount of payment from each bank and savings bank was limited to 50 francs per person every half a month, but now there is no limit, regardless of the amount. For this reason, there was no rush to withdraw deposits in the first week of the outbreak of the war, and the people's subscription to national defense bonds reached as much as 16 billion francs in an instant. In short, during this war, economic and financial warfare plans are extremely important. All resources must be mobilized to ensure that the domestic economy maintains at least the minimum level of functional activity. If it is necessary to adopt a strategy of attrition in the future, then the more production is sought, the less consumption is sought, the more likely we are to last. We need to manufacture airplanes, cannons, and ammunition now, but we should also produce food, manufacture clothing, and maximize exports to preserve gold reserves. As for all consumption, it should be cut to the minimum amount. The goods purchased from abroad should be reduced, and various items that are not essential should not be imported. Anything that facilitates the enemy should not be allowed to be exported. In the European War, there will be those who make shocking profits from the war, and this will never be allowed to happen. People who have not set out to fight in the war have greatly increased their donations and taxes, and exchange management measures have also begun to be implemented. In short, in 1918, the Allied countries won because of their greater war potential, and this advantage still exists, and may even be greater than before. Therefore, our victory is as sure as capturing something with our left hand." (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Paris - The government has recently issued an order stating that various foreign exchange businesses and gold sales are prohibited unless specifically authorized by the Bank of France. It also stipulates the following: (1) purchasing real estate or other assets abroad that require payment in foreign currency, (2) depositing the proceeds from the sale of exported goods abroad, and (3) sending various stocks, deeds, bonds, banknotes, gold, and silver abroad are all considered capital exports and are prohibited.

<p>Declares Strict Neutrality Towards Canada</p>
<p>Hyde Park - Authoritative sources stated today that President Roosevelt will call a special session of Congress at the end of this week to amend the Neutrality Act. It is predicted that the regular session of Congress will be held on October 2nd. It is widely believed that this delay is due to fear that stubborn isolationists in Congress will oppose amending the Neutrality Act. The administration will do its best to ensure that things proceed smoothly. If necessary, it may use the cloture rule, which has only been used two or three times in American history. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Washington - President Roosevelt, who is vacationing at his estate in Hyde Park, issued a declaration immediately after learning that the Canadian Confederation had declared war on Germany. The declaration is divided into three parts: (1) The United States maintains strict neutrality towards Canada, (2) the Neutrality Act should be immediately extended to Canada, and (3) arms shipments to Canada are prohibited. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>New York - President Roosevelt has boarded a special train from his estate in Hyde Park and is returning to Washington. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Hyde Park, USA - According to reliable sources, President Roosevelt will call Congress into a special session within this week to amend the current Neutrality Act, but the date of the meeting has not yet been decided, and may be in early October. The government hopes that the discussion will be limited to amending the Neutrality Act, and pay special attention to the repeal of the arms embargo treaty. Although President Roosevelt has not expressed his opinion on this point, he is concerned that the discussions will be complex after Congress reconvenes, because those members who advocate repealing the arms embargo clause will make the people of Britain, France, and Poland think that the United States is sympathetic to them, while those who oppose the repeal will make Germany think that it is beneficial, which is contrary to the purpose of neutrality. The President is therefore hesitant, but because the situation is such that Congress cannot be delayed any longer, he resolutely called it as soon as possible. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>London - The Ministry of Information issued a statement saying that Foreign Secretary Halifax has ordered Judge Jebb Kugg to send a letter to League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, stating: "Our Foreign Secretary, on behalf of the British government, made a speech at the Executive Council of the League of Nations on May 23 of this year, explaining the various obligations that our country has accepted to maintain peace, and said that these obligations are based on a common principle, that is, the method of using force to force others to accept certain demands must be resisted, because if this method is used continuously, human civilization will inevitably tend to destruction and constitute a state of anarchy. In Britain, all actions are based on conforming to the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant. However, the German government suddenly took aggressive actions against one of the member states of the League of Nations, namely Poland, on the 1st of this month. This not only violates the various obligations contained in the 1928 Paris Peace Pact, but also violates the obligations that Germany had previously accepted towards Poland, that is, the obligation not to use force to resolve disputes between Germany and Poland, and even disregards the peace appeals made by all parties. The British government, together with the French government, made a final effort to ensure that peaceful negotiations could be conducted between Germany and Poland. After the German army invaded Polish territory, it made every effort to urge Germany to withdraw its troops from Poland through diplomatic channels. However, all these efforts failed. Therefore, the British government had no choice but to implement the obligations it had accepted towards Poland. These obligations first appeared in the declaration issued by the British government on March 31 of this year, and were later detailed in the mutual assistance agreement signed between Britain and Poland on August 25 of this year. Since Germany has continued to take aggressive actions against Poland, the British government, in accordance with the above-mentioned obligations, declared war on Germany on the 3rd of this month. We hereby report this to you, hoping that you will take note of it and forward it to the governments of all member states. (Havas, 10th)</p>

<p>Tokyo - Japan is now trying to end the large-scale border disputes with the Soviet Union and plans to demarcate some border areas as demilitarized zones. It is said that there may be even broader adjustment measures. However, insiders say that there are too many pending cases between Japan and the Soviet Union, and it is too early to say that there is a possibility of concluding a non-aggression treaty. However, there are already clues to be found. In the past, the Japanese Ambassador to "Manchukuo" was concurrently held by Ueda, Commander of the Kwantung Army. Recently, Lieutenant General Umezu has been appointed to the ambassadorial post. Umezu believes that Japan, at the current stage of the war against China, must not waste its military power and engage in conflict with the Soviet Union, so he advocates resolving the border conflict between Japan and the Soviet Union as soon as possible. According to reliable sources, the appointment of Umezu as the Japanese Ambassador to "Manchukuo" was personally decided by the Japanese Emperor to ease the serious situation on the border of "Manchukuo." At the same time, the Japanese Foreign Ministry also instructed the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Togo, to seek diplomatic means with the Soviet side to resolve the Nomonhan incident. If the Nomonhan case is resolved, other pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union, such as fishing rights, oil and coal rights in Sakhalin, Soviet aid to China, and border disputes, will all be discussed one by one. Note that Umezu is the person who concluded the He-Umezu Agreement with He Yingqin in 1934. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Tokyo - Political circles here firmly deny the rumors that Japan has changed its attitude toward the Soviet Union. This news came from Berlin, stating that when Prime Minister Abe outlined the essentials of Japanese foreign policy last Saturday, he stated that the Japanese government is now revising the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union based on the advice of German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. In addition, the news from the German side that the Japanese Prime Minister advocated the conclusion of a Japanese-Soviet non-aggression treaty was also denied by political circles here, and it was firmly stated that the Prime Minister believed that Japan had joined the Anti-Comintern Pact and at the same time concluded a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union.

<p>Washington - According to observations from diplomatic circles here, Japan's neutrality in the European war is aimed at obtaining great commercial benefits. It is expected that it will soon negotiate a new commercial treaty with the United States, because the goods that Japan previously imported from Germany, Britain, and France will now all rely on the United States. At the same time, Japan's imports from South American countries have increased compared to before, and Japan's exports to South American countries have also slightly improved. It is expected that Japan will soon discuss the conclusion of a new commercial treaty with the United States. However, the US position is the open door policy and equal opportunity in China. If Japan still attempts to monopolize and exclusively occupy China, then a new commercial treaty will not be possible. Therefore, the key to negotiations must be to stop the war against China and to remove the various restrictions set up by Japan that squeeze out foreign trade. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)</p>

The content is to commend India, from the princes to the people, for their voluntary expression of loyalty, stating: "At this time when our nation is engaged in war, I firmly believe that all Indian subjects will be able to give the British government sympathy and assistance to overcome the common crisis, because Britain is fighting not for its own purposes, but for the vital principles of mankind's future. According to these principles, civilized countries should relate to each other on the basis of reason and law, and not rely on force, so that human life will not always be threatened by the horrors of war, and can enjoy the benefits of life." After reading the decree, Viceroy Linlithgow gave a speech stating that he firmly believed that the Indian army would maintain its glorious traditional spirit and that all subjects of the country would be able to fulfill their responsibilities and live up to their duties. According to the report submitted by Lord Chatfield, the British Minister for Defense Coordination, the Indian army has been modernized and is no different from the armies of the major industrial countries in the world.

The Balkan countries are currently holding talks in the capital of Yugoslavia. If the outcome can implement neutrality, then Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will definitely support it.

<p>Chongqing - According to General Chen Cheng's remarks to an Associated Press reporter today, "The close cooperation between the guerrillas and the Central Army is the most effective way to enhance the resistance behind the Japanese army. Our goal is to destroy puppets, disrupt transportation lines, and incite the mutiny of the Japanese army (this possibility is now becoming increasingly greater). Therefore, the Japanese army's attention has been forced to focus on the areas it has occupied and is unable to move forward. What is important is that we have cancelled the Japanese people's efforts to use Chinese resources to conquer China." He also said that "the Sino-Japanese War is part of the world's anti-aggression war, and I believe that the United States' policy is not to help aggressors," "so in the future, for aggressor countries such as Japan, it will definitely cut off their supply of military raw materials." He also said that "the current anti-aggression war in Europe is completely the same as China, so this war in Europe is enough to enhance the morale of the Chinese army and the spirit of the people, but we only have one enemy, which is Japan. The British and French will definitely know this." (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>Beiping - The so-called "Shinmin-kai" is the only political party in the Japanese-occupied area of North China. Senior officials of the association in Beiping have been detained by the Japanese for crimes such as defrauding money and failing to perform their duties. Leaders of branch offices in various places have also resigned one after another, and there is a possibility of continuing to be arrested. Therefore, in fact, the Shinmin-kai in North China has no leaders. This arrest occurred on the 7th of this month, and Kusaizumi Tetsuro, the General Manager of the General Affairs Department of the Beiping General Association, was detained at this time. As for his crimes, they are embezzlement of anti-British propaganda expenses and theft of rural revitalization funds. Currently, the Japanese authorities here are starting to investigate in order to determine the total amount of embezzled public funds. (According to the Shinmin-kai, 500,000 Japanese yen are allocated monthly, specifically for rural revitalization and public welfare undertakings). First, the Japanese military officers in North China deeply felt that the association's achievements were not good and seemed to be suspected of engaging in private fraud, so they began to investigate. After reviewing the account books, they arrested the Japanese Kusaizumi and other department ministers. It is heard that, as of now, only Kusaizumi is the only Japanese person who has been arrested. The Japanese side will investigate the branch offices in various places separately, so there may be more members imprisoned in the future. After Kusaizumi was arrested, his Chinese colleagues were imprisoned one after another, and the leaders in various places in North China also applied to resign at the same time. In addition, the Japanese authorities here have also conducted a strict investigation on the major Chinese newspapers, because some people pointed out that the newspapers purchased large quantities of grain with the flood relief funds raised and then resold them to the refugees and collected huge profits (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)</p>

The "Frankfurter Zeitung" commented on the British Cabinet's declaration to prepare for a three-year war, saying that the British Cabinet's declaration has been answered by General Goering.

<h3 id="e57">Sino-Japanese War Enters Third Year: American Opinions; Survey by American Institute of Public Opinion; Majority Supports Taking Active Measures to Protect American Interests in China <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Gallup, Director of the American Institute of Public Opinion, recently published the Institute's survey on American opinions as the Sino-Japanese War enters its third year. The majority supports taking active measures to protect American interests in China. In the survey, only one-quarter of voters believed that the U.S. government should "take no action" toward China. The remaining three-quarters supported three specific courses of action. The first, a small number, believed that the United States should go to war with Japan. The second, a larger number, would be satisfied as long as the State Department protested to the Japanese government when American interests in China seemed to be hindered. The third, the largest group, believed that the appropriate course of action was to stop all shipments of American military equipment and war materials to the Japanese army.</p>
<p>This survey was conducted among a cross-section of voters in various U.S. states. The question was, to what extent should the U.S. government protect American interests in China? Voters chose from four policies that the U.S. government could follow: (1) Go to war with Japan, (2) Protest to Japan through the State Department, (3) Stop all U.S. shipments of war materials to Japan, (4) Take no action. The results were as follows: 6% supported war, 18% supported protests, 51% supported stopping shipments, and 25% supported taking no action.</p>
<p>The British Institute of Public Opinion, affiliated with the American Institute of Public Opinion, conducted a similar survey in Britain and found that British voters were more eager to take decisive action in China than American voters. More than one-fifth of British voters believed that Britain should go to war with Japan if necessary. The remainder supported ending all trade between Britain and Japan, or providing credit loans and military supplies to China, or recalling the British ambassador to Japan as a protest. Only a small group (15%) believed that Britain should "take no action."</p>
<p>The survey conducted in Britain differed slightly in wording. The results were: 22% supported war, 37% supported stopping all trade with Japan, 17% supported supplying China with military equipment, 9% supported recalling the British ambassador as a protest, and 15% supported taking no action. The survey results have significant implications in two respects. According to news from China, the Japanese army has launched an anti-British movement to incite anti-British sentiment among the Japanese, but has never organized an anti-American movement. However, the Institute of Public Opinion's survey shows that Americans' feelings toward Japan are no more friendly than the British. The U.S. survey is also significant when compared to the sentiment in the United States two years ago when the Sino-Japanese War began. At that time, the Institute of Public Opinion's survey found that many Americans supported a hands-off, "no action" policy, as well as withdrawing American citizens and interests from China. Most people also opposed implementing an embargo against Japan. However, today's opinions have shifted toward hoping for action.</p>
<p>The U.S. survey reveals some interesting regional differences in opinion. The Far West, including the Rocky Mountains or the Pacific coast, is most in favor of taking action to protect American interests in China. The Far West had fewer voters supporting "no action" than any other part of the United States, perhaps because the region is geographically closest to Japan and most affected by events in the Pacific. The survey results for each region are as follows:</p>
<p>Voters in the American survey explained their attitudes toward Japan, citing a wide variety of reasons for supporting action. Those who supported the most extreme course of action, war with Japan, stated that the United States would eventually fight Japan anyway, and that we should help "contain the rogue nation." Those who supported an embargo on war materials to Japan could be represented by the opinion of a housewife from Troy, New York, who said, "If we don't want war, then why supply war materials?"</p>
<h3 id="e58">Key Japanese Figures in Xiamen: Mito Haruzo and Sawa Shigenobu; Naval Faction Overpowers Xiamen Faction; Xiamen Communications Ultimately Fail <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen Communication: The key Japanese figures in Xiamen were originally Consul Yamada, Naval Commander Miyata Yoshiichi, and Special Agency Chief Lieutenant Colonel Sawa River. This spring, the "Asia Development Board" was established, with liaison offices in four locations: Peiping, Zhangjiakou, Shanghai, and Xiamen. Rear Admiral Mito Haruzo of the Japanese Navy was ordered by the Board to come to Xiamen with the responsibility of being in charge of the political offensive in South China. As a result, the Japanese naval faction in Xiamen gained the support of Mito, and their arrogance greatly increased. For example, the Japanese military had already handed over the authority for the invasion of Fujian to the army. After Mito's arrival in Xiamen, it was changed to naval control. Currently, although the army faction constantly thinks of revenge, Mito is a very popular figure among the key Japanese figures in Xiamen. His background is as follows, according to Japanese publications:</p>
<p>"Mito Haruzo, from Hiroshima Prefecture, graduated from the Naval Academy in 1908. He has served as Chief of Staff of the Mako Naval Base, Captain of the Kako and Haruna cruisers, Chief of Staff of the Second Fleet, Commander of the Kure Guard District, Commander of the Mako Naval Base, and has been serving in the Military Command Headquarters since the autumn of the year before last." Why is the "Asia Development Board Liaison Office" not located in Guangzhou but in Xiamen? Why must Mito Haruzo be appointed as the director? There is a great deal of significance in this. According to Sho Ogata's "Asia Development Board Liaison Office and Japanese Officials," "Because Xiamen is across from Taiwan, this newly established liaison office is different from the other three liaison offices. Rather than saying that it is dealing with the Chinese, it is better to say that it is an extension of Taiwan (note). Therefore, the director of the Xiamen Liaison Office is Rear Admiral Mito Haruzo, who has held important positions in the military command system. It should be noted that the person helping him is Colonel Hara Chūichi, Director of the Naval Special Agency." The purpose of establishing the Xiamen Liaison Office of the "Asia Development Board" is to serve as an extension of Taiwan. To put it bluntly, it is to use Xiamen as a starting point to turn all the provinces of South China into Taiwan, into a colony in its pocket. Can Mito take on this responsibility for the Japanese side's intentions? This is a big question. What achievements have the Japanese made in the two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, the target of the South China invasion, over the past two years? Has the establishment of the Liaison Office brought any new achievements or gains? The facts speak for themselves. In Guangdong, the Japanese army can only be confined to the Zhou area of Guangzhou. After capturing Chaozhou and Shantou, they have not been able to cross the Lei Pool one step. What about Fujian? After the fall of Kinmen and Xiamen, the Japanese have made no progress in the past year. Recently, the mad blockade of the seaports can only harass undefended islands. As for the political offensive, the scope of activity of Japanese spies and traitors has gradually shrunk. The Xiamen Liaison Office, presided over by Mito, has indeed worked hard in this regard, training a group of young people, women, children, and monks. Facts have proven that this is just a waste of time, money, and effort. The spies he trained have not achieved even one percent of the effect he hoped for. Although Mito is experienced and ruthless, and the Japanese side has placed unlimited hopes on him, he is also powerless and cannot achieve anything. The only achievement is to overwhelm the army faction in the internal strife and give the naval faction entrenched in Xiamen a chance to raise its head (to be continued).</p>

<p>Taixian Communication: According to a recent investigation, the anti-Japanese war results in the occupied areas of Jiangsu Province are best in the counties of Xuzhou. It is estimated that they have long held down the strength of a Japanese division, occupying 62 key transportation points. In the past three months, the guerrillas in various counties have engaged the Japanese army in more than 50 battles, including more than ten positional battles, and five or six attacks on large-scale Japanese mopping-up operations. In total, the Japanese side has suffered more than 1,000 casualties. The guerrillas have destroyed more than 20 sections of the Tianjin-Pukou and Longhai Railways and highways, destroyed five Japanese trains, and removed more than 70 li of telegraph poles and wires. Now that the autumn crops are gradually losing their cover, the counties are transforming the transportation ditches dug along the highways to change the terrain and obstruct Japanese military action.</p>

<h3 id="e61">Specialized Schools Above the Secondary Level in the Interior Restrict Construction of School Buildings: Regulations Suitable for the Period of the War of Resistance <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) The Ministry of Education believes that in the past, the construction of school buildings for specialized schools above the secondary level cost a great deal, and the principles of solidity, practicality, safety, economy, simplicity, and beauty were not fully met. Now, during the period of the War of Resistance, schools along the coast have successively relocated to the interior. These newly relocated schools, and the schools originally established in the interior, have insufficient school buildings and often economize on funds or apply for appropriations to request additional school buildings. The Ministry of Education has specially formulated temporary regulations for the construction of school buildings for specialized schools above the secondary level. From the 27th academic year onwards, all specialized schools above the secondary level in the country must follow the regulations if they need to build or add school buildings. The general procedures are that during the War of Resistance, public and private specialized schools above the secondary level shall not construct or add school buildings unless there is a special need and one of the following four conditions is met: (1) Schools in war zones relocate and start classes, and there are no public or private places available for rent, or the rented houses are insufficient; (2) Schools relocating and starting classes have plans to establish themselves permanently in the relocated location; (3) Schools located in non-war zones have admitted a large number of students from war zones, causing the original school buildings to exceed their maximum capacity and are indeed unable to accommodate them; (4) Newly established schools have no suitable school buildings available for rent. School building construction is divided into three categories: teaching buildings, administrative buildings, and staff and student dormitories. The area of each type of building and the distribution of construction costs are as follows: (Category) Teaching Buildings, (Buildings) Classrooms, laboratories, libraries, science halls, gymnasiums, auditoriums, etc., (Percentage of Building Area) 30-40, (Percentage of Construction Costs) 40-60, Administrative Buildings, Offices, medical rooms, etc., (Percentage of Building Area) 5-10, (Percentage of Construction Costs) 5-10, Staff and Student Dormitories, Staff Dormitories, Student Dormitories, dining halls, washrooms, toilets, etc., (Percentage of Building Area) 40-60, (Percentage of Construction Costs) 30-40. Among all staff and student dormitories, the building area and construction costs of staff dormitories shall not exceed one-sixth of the total number of student dormitories.</p>

<p>Sanwu University: Sanwu University on Renji Road held an opening ceremony and the first graduation ceremony of the Special Law Department on the 10th. More than 200 people attended. First, Director-General Wang Fengnian reported on the events of the past year, followed by exhortations from Provost Xu Chongqin, Dean of the Law School Shan Yuhua, and various professors. The main idea was to encourage the graduating students to continue their research and work hard. The words were very cautionary and earnest. Then, Dean Shan of the Law School issued graduation certificates, and Xu Weigong gave a speech in English. After the meeting, Professor Fang Junjie hosted a public banquet for the staff and graduating students.</p>
<p>Junyi Middle School: Junyi Middle School in this city, the first section of the senior and junior high school departments on the fifth floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road, and the second section of the junior high school department on the fifth floor of the Pudong Tongxiang Association on Foch Road, will recruit two to five free students per class within one week from now, limited to poor students, to relieve poor and out-of-school youth. The referrer for the free person must be a faculty member of the school, a graduate of the senior or junior high school, or someone who is directly acquainted with the director of the school. The registration procedures are the same as for ordinary students. The number of places is limited and will not be advertised separately.</p>
<p>National Studies Training Class: The Dacheng Society and the Datong Music Society in this city both have considerable history. In view of the lack of popularity of national studies and national music, a National Studies Training Class has been established at 36 Songshan Road, with the aim of promoting national essence and cultivating basic talent. The courses include basic Chinese, applied writing, poetry, Kunqu Opera, and music. Anyone with a junior high school education or above, with pure thoughts, and excellent character and learning, can register for the entrance exam. At the initial opening of the class, only 30 students will be admitted. Tuition is low, and poor children can apply for free admission. Classes will begin on the 18th.</p>
<p>Seventh Vocational School: The Seventh China Vocational Supplementary School, affiliated with the China Vocational Education Society at 68 Yuyuan Road, started classes yesterday (the 11th). It is reported that each department is about to be full. Registration for admission is still possible today.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Male and Female Volleyball League Championship Finals: Fang Gang Defeats Fudan Again; Women's Ever-Victorious Youxing Suffers a Crushing Defeat; Fudan's Lu Duoyun Single-Handedly Contributes <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>The four major male and female volleyball teams in Shanghai met last night at the Zhongqing Fitness Center. In the women's match, Fudan played Youxing, and in the men's match, Fang Gang played Fudan. The Fudan women's team was the champion of the Zhongqing League's Ordinary Group, while Youxing was the champion team of the Hongyi Cup women's group. Fang Gang and Fudan each won one final in the Zhongqing and Hongyi Cups. Last night was nothing less than another overall final, so the battle was extremely tense. A large audience filled Zhongqing, and the performance was extremely exciting. As a result, the Fudan women's team defeated Youxing 2-0, winning two consecutive games, while the Fang Gang men's team fought fiercely for four games, and in a difficult and indistinguishable situation, finally won against Fu Dan. The scores are as follows:</p>
<p>Fudan Women: Lu Duoyun, Tan Taiwei, Wang Qian, Chen Liuzhen, Zhang Ningzhu, Chen Wanruo, Chen Jieshu, Xiao Huilan, Wang Guangmei,</p>
<p>Youxing Women: Zhu Peiqing, Zhang Jiapei, Zhu Shiqin, Zhang Xiangping, Huang Xingfen, Shi Ruijuan, Xu Yuqi, Shao Tao, Cheng Hongsheng,</p>
<p>Fang Gang A: Li Huanhan, Mai Bingyao, Luo Jiaquan, Guo Bingkun, Zheng Weiguo, Zheng Yiquan, Chen Xinchun, Wu Shounan, Wu Zhaoyuan,</p>
<p>Fudan Men: Li Weifan, Zhou Shuyun, Tan Yongzhan, Liang Yunming, Yu Buzi, Yuan Zejian, Jin Yuanji, Zhu Keming, Li Wenjian,</p>
<p>Youxing Defeated</p>
<p>The women's teams of Fudan and Youxing took the stage first. After each scoring three points, Fudan scored six consecutive points. Youxing relied on Cheng Hongsheng's serve to tie it at 8-8, 10-10, and 16-15. Lu Duoyun's serve was powerful, scoring five consecutive points. Fudan won the first game 21-15. Having suffered this setback, Youxing tried to rally. At the beginning of the second game, they led 5-0, and changed courts with a score of 11-0, smoothly creating an absolute advantage of 20-9. They only needed one more point to tie the game. Unexpectedly, the right to serve was taken away, and Fudan's Lu Duoyun repeated the same trick, taking over 12 points and winning again 22-20. Fudan cheered as if they were in a daze, while Youxing was disheartened. Youxing, who had never been defeated, was actually subjected to this humiliation, and will definitely continue to work hard to seek revenge.</p>
<p>Fang Gang Wins Again</p>
<p>Fudan and Fang Gang then fought, adopting a best-of-five format. The competition was fierce, and the audience applauded and cheered. After five ties in the first game, Fang Gang took the lead 11-9. After 18-11, Fudan suddenly increased their score by five points, and actually took the lead 20-19. Unfortunately, they still lost the first game 20-22. After Fang Gang won the second game 21-14, Fudan tried to cheer up. The third game was indeed very successful, and Fang Gang became the follower. Fudan won back the thirteenth game 21-17, but in the last game, Fang Gang's attack was even more dramatic, and Fudan was defeated 21-15.</p>

<h3 id="e70">Financial Speculation Comes and Goes, the Gold Market is Uncertain, Hovering Within the 4,000 Yuan Mark, Fluctuating 160 Yuan Throughout the Day <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market was chaotic because speculators were still uncertain. They gathered in the market all day, coming and going. As a result, market prices fluctuated. However, the results, although rumors over the weekend afternoon were untrue, and today's foreign exchange tightened slightly, the gold price rose sharply by 145 yuan. This was due to the tense situation in the Hongqiao area of Shanghai and the improved appetite of the Hakka gangs. At the opening, foreign exchange was reported to be weak, with a strong trend. The morning opening was as high as 3,950 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm and others aggressively stuffed the market, briefly pushing the price down to 3,880 yuan. Then, cash firms and securities gangs strongly supported the price, pulling it back up to 3,955 yuan. Then, because foreign exchange loosened, sellers came in droves. Money exchange firms threw and stuffed the market first, followed by gold firms selling. In addition, securities gangs advanced and then suddenly aggressively suppressed the price, which collapsed, falling to a low of 3,800 yuan. At noon, pawnshops saw low prices and absorbed, raising the price to 3,840 yuan at closing. In the afternoon, at the opening, securities gangs suddenly turned bullish again, causing the price to rise sharply to 3,870 yuan. Soon, because money exchange firms and others stuffed the market, the price fell again to 3,825 yuan. Afterwards, because foreign exchange slightly weakened, coupled with the sudden release of Hong Kong funds, people were agitated. Securities gangs and a certain gold firm took advantage of the situation, and the price rose by more than 100 yuan, reaching a peak of 3,960 yuan. At closing, because retail investors took profits and came out, the price fell back to 3,930 yuan at closing. Trading was brisk, with more than 2,000 taels traded. The price of pawnshop gold jewelry ultimately increased by 5 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Spot Trading Still Lively</p>
<p>Since the morning, the initial price for each bar (10 taels) was relatively high because foreign exchange was reported to be weak, so buyers were quite crowded. The opening price was dozens of yuan higher than the off-site price on the previous day, an increase of 165 yuan compared to the weekend noon closing. Money exchange firms mutually traded 10 taels, the price being 3,950 yuan. After the opening, a certain gold firm suddenly took profits for speculators, and pawnshops frequently threw and stuffed the market, the market immediately became unsustainable. Soon after, the price was suppressed by 70 yuan. A certain gold firm sold 20 taels to a pawnshop for 3,880 yuan. Afterwards, a certain cash firm suddenly strongly supported the price on behalf of wealthy individuals, and securities gangs also competed to absorb, causing the price to immediately turn upward. Before long, it had risen by 75 yuan. A certain cash firm bought 20 taels from a money exchange firm for 3,955 yuan. At that time, because foreign exchange hardened, it immediately triggered a selling frenzy. Money exchange firms were the first to throw and stuff the market, and a certain gold firm and cash firms also followed suit.

At that time, because cash firms suddenly came to boost the price, it rose again, once hovering between 3,850 and 3,860 yuan. Afterwards, because foreign exchange was reported to be weak, the buying frenzy was strong. Securities gangs and a certain firm and Hong Kong funds competed to vigorously buy, coupled with very few sellers, resulting in a straight upward leap, increasing by 100 yuan.

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the HSBC listed price unchanged. Although the black market for English and American exchanges did not change much that day, the situation was sometimes tight and sometimes loose, hovering around the weekend noon closing price.

The Central Government's listed exchange rates remained the same. The bank's morning opening spot selling prices were English gold three points nineteen thousand six hundred and eighty-seven five, and American exchange six yuan sixty-five six two five, compared with the weekend, neither honor nor disgrace. After the opening, operators mostly looked shrunk due to the situation in the Hongqiao area of ​​Shanghai, so there were very few sellers. In addition, the Bank of England favorably absorbed spot goods, and the Hong Kong Electric and China Bank aggressively grabbed futures, so the potential was gradually soft. Li bought spot American exchange from colleagues for six yuan sixty-two five and five six two five. Then Hong Kong Electric pulled in foreign banks for September English gold three points eight hundred and seventy-five, and the same month American exchange six yuan bull. When HSBC's listing revealed that there was no movement, and the silver balance tax revealed that there was also no increase or decrease. Later, China Bank and others concluded with Datong for September American exchange six yuan forty-three seven five. At that time, Chinese businessmen also bought the same price from a certain bank for September American exchange. At that time, the foreign bank's spot selling price of English gold had softened to two points nine thousand and sixty-two five, and the American exchange had tightened to six yuan half. Later, Hong Kong Electric suddenly came back out, and Li and China Bank also stopped buying and started selling. In addition, Western businessman Sassoon also joined the selling frenzy, so the market situation suddenly turned hard. Hong Kong Electric, Sassoon, and Li, China Bank, etc., successively sold spot English gold to HSBC Huabi Maccaghini from three points nine thousand and sixty-two five, to long gold four points zero three one two five. Then China Bank sold spot American exchange six yuan sixty-eight seven five and seventy-five to a certain bank.

<p>The Shanghai Public Industry Institute reported that the market was active yesterday. The momentum of the rubber stock market was indeed strong. Due to the increase in the quota, the high value of raw rubber is sufficient to view this trend as no different. Rubber stocks in Shanghai are almost the cheapest among rubber stock markets around the world today. Recently, I read a printed matter from Singapore, which made every effort to draw people's attention to investing in the Shanghai market, saying that it is too attractive. If the current rubber stock price of this Institute is converted into the Singapore currency value, and the number of acres or output of each rubber company is used as the calculation standard, then it will be discovered that its value is low and truly shocking.</p>

The shouts to buy are greatly encouraged, and the prices are raised by each other. The market is becoming more and more charming. However, foreign exchange is lengthening and gold is declining.

<p>The transaction of current cotton is still not weak, but it is slightly clearer than the previous day, because the European and American cotton markets have returned again, and foreign exchange has loosened, but the calculated price is still high. When the local cotton is in the process of concluding new cotton, the trading of white package flowers is progressing daily. As for the daily factory's digestion of the stomach is slightly stagnant, not as smooth as in the past, because the amount absorbed recently is very huge. However, although the Shenxin and Wing On factories have no shortage of reserves, they are currently opening a large number of cotton yarns. The purchase of raw materials is in a batch, and the mutual buying and selling among colleagues is still endless. Changxinghao entered 1,000 pieces of Indian cotton, which is the amount to be sent to the Shenxin Factory.

<p>Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai have been very active in recent days. A few days ago, due to the soaring cotton market overseas and the contraction of foreign exchange, the spot prices of the same industry have also soared. Yesterday, the overseas cotton market rebounded slightly, but local selling prices have not been able to loosen, because the various foreign expenses for shipping cotton from overseas to Shanghai are very large. At present, no one from the foreign company is ordering, and all the transactions in March and April are now spot goods among the same industry. This is because the price of this spot commodity is still 30 to 40 yuan cheaper than the foreign company's quoted price.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices, the New York cotton market was quite weak yesterday, because the government's estimated output was more than 900,000 packages more than the report last month, so there were no buyers in the market. At the same time, spot merchants and overseas cotton merchants were doing their best to sell in the market. In addition, the Indian cotton market plummeted, so the New York cotton market fell even more. Until the close, cotton prices fell by three or four called pounds, etc., compared to the previous day.

<p>The flour market is bustling with activity, and the resale market is even more lively, mainly because of the outbreak of the European war. Foreign flour and wheat are rising in price, and local wheat is also frequently increasing in price, causing considerable confusion in the market. Due to high costs, various mills have added another ten cents to the plant price, reaching seven yuan. Moreover, they only supply the local area and restrict large-scale sales to other places, so resale goods are more popular with customers. It is said that the selling price has exceeded the plant price by thirty to forty cents, and the price of foreign flour is even higher by twenty to thirty cents. Both northern and southern merchants are continuing to purchase, but the quantity is not large. The total volume of transactions for local customers is fifty to sixty thousand bags. It is reported that the buying interest in the market is gradually weakening, and hoarders who have profited from resale goods are slightly releasing their stocks, so the market is showing slight signs of easing. On the 12th, 10,300 bags of flour were shipped to Haiphong.</p>
<p>Various sources of wheat are continuously arriving, and factory sales and hoarders' sales channels are also uninterrupted. Amidst the news of rising foreign telegram prices and the increasing price of local flour, those holding goods are solely engaging in speculation, and buyers are also raising prices to absorb the goods.

<p>Since the price of coal briquettes was increased again at the beginning of the month, general coal briquette factories are also afraid of a shortage of raw materials. They strictly restrict the sale of new stock lists to various stores, causing people to be uneasy. Trading houses hoard and speculate, and users store up to prevent shortages. The market atmosphere is rising, causing frequent under-the-table transactions and chaotic selling prices. General non-industry hoarders who hold stock lists are even taking the opportunity to inflate prices and sell them through door-to-door stores. The standard price of large factory goods is 74 yuan per ton, or 3.7 yuan per hundred catties. The price of small factory goods is one or two yuan cheaper. However, according to a certain factory, Hongji coal fines are arriving continuously, and yesterday there was also a telegram from the mine land to Shanghai, stating that one ship has been loaded. Because white coal fines have no other use except for making coal briquettes, there are no obstacles to navigation, so there is no need to worry about a shortage of raw materials, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e83">Silk and Tea: Japanese Silk Recovers Slightly; Shanghai Silk Remains Firm <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>There was no market in New York yesterday. Yokohama silk prices fell. Spot goods were not sold. The near-term September price was 1,581 yuan, down 49 yuan; the October price was 1,571 yuan, down 29 yuan; the far-term February price was 1,500 yuan, down 39 yuan. This was due to the recovery of the Japanese yen exchange rate. There were sporadic transactions in the local silk market by American merchants. The Shanghai factory reported a price of 4,300 yuan for 20-22 silk and 4,250 yuan for tin silk. Nearly 50 dan were transacted. The Baitou Foreign Firm imported 70 dan of Qili native silk, Qianjin, and Hai Zi reeling yesterday. The price of Qianjin silk rose by 30 yuan, and the rest also showed a strong trend. The Qili silk passed through six trading houses. Recently, foreign firms have purchased a lot, so market sales have been stagnant. At the same time, there are few Qili silk stocks in the interior, so Shanghai silk merchants are temporarily watching and waiting and will not easily dump their goods.</p>

<p>All foreign goods are attracting the attention of hoarders. It has been found that pepper can be stored for a long time without deteriorating, so some people have recently purchased and hoarded it, and the price is very good. Yesterday, Wen Dao white pepper rose to 160 yuan, and Dutch white pepper rose to 145 yuan, a sharp increase of twenty to thirty yuan compared to before.

<p>The medium-quality vegetables in the recent market are still weak, but high-quality vegetables are firm due to their scarcity. Yesterday, the Zhenjiang district offered 70 bags of Dou Zi and San Qing Zi top-quality vegetables at a price of 43 yuan, which was three yuan better than before.</p>

<h3 id="e86">The Situation in Western Shanghai Has Eased; The Municipal Council Is Conducting Negotiations; The Proposed Solutions of the Two Sides Are Far Apart; The Purpose of the Puppet Government Is to Force the Payment of Taxes <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese have long coveted the police authority on the extraterritorial roads in western Shanghai. However, because of the strong attitude of the British and American governments, they have always supported the Shanghai Municipal Council and adopted a resolute stance to deal with the incidents. Therefore, cases such as the Kellogg case and the Kinloch case, which were enough to cause serious problems, have been safely resolved, so the Japanese have not been able to achieve their goals. After the outbreak of the European War and the declarations of war by Britain and France against Germany, the Japanese actions became more active. On the 5th and 6th, they simultaneously asked Britain and France to withdraw their troops in Tokyo and Shanghai. Foreign diplomats in Shanghai knew that the Japanese were taking action on the concession issue. As expected, on September 10th, they sent puppet police to occupy the key points on the extraterritorial roads, and the Japanese military police cooperated with the puppet police to patrol the area. Yesterday, Japanese newspapers openly announced that the police authority on the extraterritorial roads had been "owned by the municipal government." This proves that the so-called "Japanese navy will take necessary steps according to the decision" made by the Japanese embassy and the army and navy spokespersons at the press conference on the 6th has gradually become a reality. However, the Shanghai Municipal Council, in consideration of the difficult times, is unwilling to take any direct action immediately, and is calmly watching its development on the one hand, and is preparing to negotiate with the Japanese through diplomatic means to reduce the severity of the situation on the other hand. However, as of last night, there were reports that this serious problem had been resolved through negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side yesterday morning. The following are the various news reports:</p>
<p>The Infringement of Rights by the Japanese Puppets Will Never Be Recognized</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of police authority on the extraterritorial roads, what actions will the Shanghai Municipal Council take in the future? A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency specially interviewed a senior British official in Shanghai yesterday to inquire about the truth. According to the official, the Shanghai Municipal Council will absolutely not recognize the Japanese puppets' extraterritorial infringement of rights. Because although Japanese soldiers and puppet police have invaded the extraterritorial roads in recent days, the occupied areas are the houses in the Japanese military occupation zone along the road, and they have never interfered with the Shanghai Municipal Council's exercise of police authority in the western Shanghai area. Therefore, it is not planned to take immediate action to increase the severity of the situation, but it is prepared to negotiate with the Japanese through diplomatic means. In order to prevent the occurrence of the same incident as the Kinloch case, the Shanghai Municipal Council seems to have no choice but to take this step.</p>
<p>The Fu Bureau Has Begun Negotiations</p>
<p>Yesterday's Western newspapers reported that the Shanghai Municipal Council held a meeting at 11:00 a.m. the day before to discuss this issue, but the Shanghai Municipal Council denied it yesterday, saying only that it is currently contacting the consular corps regarding this case and intends to negotiate with the Japanese. However, a reliable source told a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency at 6:00 p.m. yesterday that the Shanghai Municipal Council had resolved the issue of police authority on the extraterritorial roads with the Japanese side at a meeting yesterday morning, returning the old police authority on the extraterritorial roads to the Shanghai Municipal Council and giving the police authority on the newly opened extraterritorial roads to the puppet "municipal government." However, it has not been confirmed. It is only certain that the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side officially began negotiations yesterday. However, it is heard that the Japanese demands are far from the rumored solutions. It is rumored that the authorities are following the following paths to resolve the issue: (1) Re-divide the police authority on the extraterritorial roads, and determine which areas belong to the Shanghai Municipal Council and which areas belong to the puppet municipal government. (2) The police authority belongs to the Shanghai Municipal Council, and the taxes belong to the puppet "municipal government." If this is the case, it will inevitably be opposed by the Chinese side.</p>
<p>The Puppet Government Attempts to Force the Payment of Taxes</p>
<p>Since the Japanese puppets have been stationed in the area of the extraterritorial roads in western Shanghai and have investigated the residents, there have been rumors that the puppet "municipal government" will force the residents in the area to pay house donations and land rent to the puppet government. A reporter recently inquired about the opinion of a senior official of the Shanghai Municipal Council. According to the official, the responsibility for the residents of the extraterritorial roads to pay donations is entirely determined by the residents themselves. The residents and the Shanghai Municipal Council only have a contractual relationship based on the payment of donations. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council is only concerned with the issue of paying donations and taxes to the bureau. As for whether a third party can collect residents' taxes in the area, it is not something the bureau wants to interfere with. All residents of the extraterritorial roads who pay donations and taxes to the Shanghai Municipal Council will also be provided with various municipal conveniences such as water, electricity, gas, telephone, and roads as an equivalent exchange. Conversely, if the residents in the area refuse to pay taxes, the Shanghai Municipal Council will cut off the supply of these various municipal conveniences. The bureau has taken this kind of measure in many cases before and after the Shanghai War to deal with residents who do not pay taxes to the bureau. The official also said that the donations and taxes collected by the Shanghai Municipal Council in the area in the first half of this year were only 520,000 yuan, while the expenditure for maintaining the municipal services in the area was huge, far exceeding the income. Moreover, since the outbreak of the Shanghai War, it has been slightly difficult for the Shanghai Municipal Council to collect donations in the area of the extraterritorial roads.</p>
<p>The Situation in Western Shanghai Has Eased Yesterday</p>
<p>Since the Japanese puppets have been stationed in the area of Extra-Territorial Road Jessfield Road and Yu Garden Road since the 9th, the military police have been coming and going frequently, causing rumors and panic among the residents. However, yesterday, the atmosphere has eased slightly, but the Japanese puppets are still heavily guarded in the area bordering the concession and western Shanghai. The following is a detailed record of the actual inspection of the atmosphere by a reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency:</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers and Puppet Police Have Been Reduced</p>
<p>After the Ci Lian Society at 11 Jessfield Road was occupied by the Japanese puppets on the 9th, there were 30 to 40 Japanese military police and puppet police stationed there. However, yesterday it has been reduced to puppet police, the remaining people, and three or four Japanese military police. There were originally more than ten Japanese puppets stationed beside the sandbags placed in front of the gate, but yesterday only puppet police were left to guard the gate. As for the two rooms downstairs in the house, they have been occupied for office use. Refugees still live upstairs as usual. A temporary wooden house was built in the inner room to open a middle school for refugee children. Now, due to the uneasy environment, classes cannot be held as usual. As for the armed puppet police stationed outside Qiuyuan at 15 Jessfield Road, they have all stayed inside the room yesterday and no longer set up posts outside. As for the Kangjia Bridge, Jinjia Lane, and Malu Bridge areas, the situation is still the same as the day before. Japanese soldiers and puppet police are still densely stationed on the road as usual.</p>
<p>Residents Are Prohibited from Moving Furniture</p>
<p>There are several puppet police stationed at the entrances of the Yu Garden Road Calling Ming Villa and the Zhongshi New Village, but yesterday they have been reduced to two people per alley. They still do not interfere with people entering and leaving, but they do not allow residents to move furniture and sundries out. Those who try to move items out will be confiscated. The number of puppet police stationed at the Kena Road intersection has also been reduced to three.</p>
<p>Police Cars from the Police Department Patrol as Usual</p>
<p>After the Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank staff dormitory at 1760 Jing'an Temple Road was occupied by the Japanese puppets on the 10th, sandbags were piled up in front of the gate, and Japanese soldiers and puppet police were stationed there. Yesterday, the number of sandbags in that place has been doubled, but there are only four puppet police stationed there. The residents in the dormitory have been forced to move out since yesterday, but they are still free to carry out their personal belongings. Three large trucks that the dormitory equipped for transporting staff were detained by the Japanese puppets when they returned to the dormitory and driven to western Shanghai. As for the red police cars of the police department, they were still patrolling in the Jessfield Road Caojiadu area yesterday. The traffic of Japanese puppet troops is not as frequent as the day before. The British army has not taken any action, and the residents have not moved out yet.</p>
<h3 id="e87">The United States Has a Certain Limit to Concessions on the Concession Issue <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Japan Avoids Conflict with the United States</p>
<p>According to a foreign person familiar with the situation in the concession, although the Japanese puppets have recently increased the number of police and military police on the Extra-Territorial Road and repeatedly occupied civilian houses on Jessfield Road to set up posts, the situation is quite serious, but in terms of the overall status of the concession, no changes will occur for the time being. Shanghai is an international city, and among the great powers related to Shanghai, in addition to Britain and France, the United States is in a decisive position. When Britain and France are busy with affairs in Europe, Japan can indeed exert pressure on Britain and France to exchange for certain concessions, and the same is true for the concession. However, because the United States is firmly in the middle, Japan must consider the United States and stop at the right time when it is not determined to conflict with the United States. This can be seen from Japan's consistent attitude of avoiding conflict with the United States.</p>
<p>Deeply Fears Being Blockaded by the United States</p>
<p>There are three reasons why Japan is so concerned about the United States: (1) In the past, Japan's trade with the United States reached 1.3 billion yen annually. Most of Japan's military kerosene and cotton rely on the United States for supply, while Japan's industrial products such as raw silk and rayon rely on the United States as their largest sales market. Once the United States imposes an economic blockade on Japan, Japan will suffer a fatal blow. (2) The economic power of the United States is several times higher than that of Japan in peacetime. Now that Japan is exhausted after a long-term war, it cannot be compared with the United States. If Japan offends the United States and goes to war with the United States, it will be difficult to win a decisive battle with the strength of the United States Navy, and it will inevitably expand for a long time. In this case, the economic power of the United States and Japan is so far apart, and there is no reason for Japan not to lose. (3) Since the September 18th Incident, the United States has held a negative attitude towards Japan, and the United States has the determination to resist aggression. The voice of justice has spread far and wide. The United States in the Far East will never be willing to retreat and lose its rights, just like Britain did in Europe in the past. Japan knows all this very well, so when the United States suddenly abolished the US-Japan Commercial Treaty and broke up the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo, Japan did not dare to do anything, but instead expressed goodwill to the United States.</p>
<p>Has Concerns About the Shanghai Issue</p>
<p>Today, the United States has expressed its determination not to allow the status of Shanghai to be changed. The US State Department stated that the United States' actions in the Far East are more important than words. The United States has once again expressed its determination to adhere to its determination with action. Therefore, the future of Shanghai can be inferred based on the United States as a fulcrum. Of course, the United States will not intervene in the attack on the Shanghai Concession by Japanese local soldiers within a certain range, and will leave it to Britain and France to handle it properly. However, if Japan's actions exceed a certain limit and hinder the status of the concession, the United States must abide by its promise and take action. In the Gulangyu incident, because the United States was involved (Gulangyu is also a joint concession of Britain, France, and the United States), it adopted a military policy under the promotion of the United States, so that Japan had to give up its attempt to occupy Gulangyu by force. Lessons from the past can be learned. Japan must have concerns about the United States on the Shanghai issue.</p>
<h3 id="e88">British Ambassador Tells British Nationals in China to Work Hard in Their Respective Positions; Loyalty to the Country Does Not Necessarily Mean Joining the Army; Be Patient and Wait for Instructions from London <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, broadcast a speech to British nationals in China at 1:15 p.m. yesterday (the 10th) on the XMHD China-America Radio, hoping that British nationals in China would work hard in their respective positions and settle down in their jobs before receiving instructions from the government. The Ambassador also described his own experiences in the World War in 1914 in great detail. The following is a transcript of his speech:</p>
<p>Respectfully Offer Further Advice to British Nationals</p>
<p>I am the British Ambassador to China, and I am fortunate to have this opportunity to say a few words to my fellow British nationals in China. I am only speaking to men today, with absolutely no spirit of discrimination. My goal is to offer a little advice to those who need it. The reason why I am using radio broadcasting instead of newspapers is because there is no other way to reach those of you who live in remote parts of China.</p>
<p>How to Best Serve the Country</p>
<p>We have been at war for a week. You all know what caused this war, so I don't need to repeat it. At this time, we are all thinking about how we can best serve the country.</p>
<p>Prevented from Enlisting in the Last European War</p>
<p>When we decided to go to war twenty-five years ago, I still remember my own feelings. At that time, I was a junior diplomat. My first thought was to join the army. During the four years of the war, I was prevented from enlisting by senior authorities for three whole years. I still remember how passionate my determination to oppose the authorities was, and how frustrated I was when I obeyed their orders.</p>
<p>Deeply Admire Patriotic Enthusiasm</p>
<p>But those who controlled my fate were better able to measure my usefulness than I was. Although I was often in pain, I later realized that their actions were appropriate. Today, the feelings of most of you must be the same as my feelings in the past, that is, asking yourself how you can best serve the country, and believing that you should occupy a position in the army. I can assure you that no one sympathizes with this kind of feeling more than I do.</p>
<p>Remaining in Your Original Position is Serving the Country</p>
<p>Listeners, your position does not necessarily have to be in the army. You live in China, tens of thousands of miles away from the battlefield. It takes many weeks to return to your country, and it takes even longer for your service to be put into practice. Most of you must be willing to do your best to return home as soon as possible. This kind of wish is both natural and admirable. But I don't believe this is the only right way. I hope those who listen to me will remember that your eagerness to return home may not be very helpful to the country. I think it is better for many of you to stay in China and remain in your original position. This is the best way to fulfill your duty to the country, and to wait for the opportunity to consider and determine the special suitability of your service.</p>
<p>Be Patient and Wait for Instructions</p>
<p>Although the final choice is up to you, the necessary organization for what I call "determining the special suitability of your service" is being established. I can do nothing but advise at the moment, but I feel there is no need for me to say more. My advice is given in a spirit of complete sympathy and based on a rational judgment. So please be patient.</p>
<p>The Entire Matter is Awaiting Instructions</p>
<p>And I can assure you that your loyalty and eagerness to serve will definitely be noticed by the government. The government expects you to have this kind of loyalty, but the government will not reduce its gratitude because you should have this kind of loyalty. I am asking London for instructions on the entire matter. I think it is better for us to wait and see what our government needs and how it can best use us.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Implementation of Revenue Stamps as Currency; Cash Redemption Upon Accumulation of Revenue Stamps to One Corner; It is Still a Better Transitional Solution <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>Since the Citizens' Federation proposed to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, the Money Industry Association, the Taxpayers' Associations of the Two Concessions, and the Tobacco Exchange Association to implement revenue stamps as currency to solve the difficulty of the lack of small change and to prevent the aftermath of value vouchers, the plan is accurate and redeemable, and all parties have expressed sympathy and hope that it can be implemented as soon as possible. It is now known that after the Municipal Federation published the revenue stamp currency plan, in order to avoid the usual value voucher mistakes and to effectively protect the interests of voucher holders, the Tongchun Drug Store, Fukang Soy Sauce Garden, and other businesses have printed and issued revenue stamp currency vouchers, mostly made of cardboard. In addition to attaching revenue stamps, they are also sealed with transparent paper and stamped with a seal. The vouchers can be used to exchange goods, and when ten points have been accumulated, they can be exchanged for one corner of French currency. Before the government's small change vouchers arrive in Shanghai, this is still a better transitional solution.</p>

<p>According to the English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council stated this morning (the 11th) that 400 German Jewish people will arrive in Shanghai on the Conte Rosso tomorrow (the 12th), and the authorities will allow them to land as usual. The Special Immigration Committee will not take any action for the time being, because it has not yet received the Japanese recommendations for immigration, and the date of the decision-making meeting has not been announced.</p>

<p>According to the English "China Press," several large German trading firms, whose China headquarters are located in Shanghai, have begun to liquidate their branch offices in various coastal ports in China in recent days. Due to the suspension of German shipping and the sharp decline in exports, many German trading firms have been forced to at least temporarily suspend business at their branch offices. As a result of these closures, a large number of German employees from various branch offices are flocking to Shanghai. Some have already departed, while others will be leaving soon. The headquarters in Shanghai will attempt to place them. Local German trading firms have recently felt a shortage of German employees. The arrival of employees from the branch offices will not only alleviate this shortage but will also lead to a surplus of German (Aryan) employees. German trading firms have now established a special committee to provide advice.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Mantetsu Office of the Japanese Trading Company dispatched staff member Nakajo Toraki (27 years old) and others to the Jiujiang area at the beginning of this month to investigate mining. Unexpectedly, the Japanese ship Yoyang Maru, on which Nakajo was traveling, was attacked by Chinese guerrillas on the 5th while sailing 40 miles downstream from Jiujiang. At that time, bullets rained down. In the chaos, Nakajo was shot in the abdomen. Two other Japanese nationals, Fukude Ushimatsu (27 years old) and Matsuno no Hito (29 years old), were also wounded by bullets. Nakajo died soon after due to his serious injuries. The Yoyang Maru arrived in Shanghai at 2 PM yesterday, and Nakajo's body was also transported to Shanghai at the same time.</p>

<p>Market vendors in this city, due to the collection of foreign labor fees on local goods in the area around Old Zha Gate Bridge, believe that this is illegal extortion and additional exploitation. They have collectively opposed it. Therefore, vendor Hu Lu Qingquan and others initiated the organization of a Vendor Friendship Association and sent personnel to investigate the origins of the foreign labor fees at various local goods markets. They learned that the local goods markets in Caojiadu, Shiliupu, and other places do not collect foreign labor fees or extort customary fees. Therefore, all the vendors felt even more indignant. The entire community is anxious, and they have unanimously raised their opposition, sending letters to the Local Goods Trade Association and the Municipal Council, requesting them to investigate and ban these illegal foreign labor fees in order to comply with regulations and benefit the poor.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently continued to designate the following items for embargo: (1) Garlic: A telegram from the Ministry of Military Affairs stated that garlic is also one of the raw materials for Western medicine. If exported in large quantities, it should be included in the embargo list. The Ministry of Economic Affairs has designated and announced this. (2) Rapeseed, Rapeseed Oil: A telegram from the Ministry of Military Affairs stated that rapeseed and rapeseed oil can be used as substitutes for military oil. They should be embargoed. It is necessary to investigate the production volume and current prices to find ways to purchase them. However, horse mane and hair are used very little in the military and there is no need to embargo them.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, various industries in this city have been raising prices due to the inability to ship foreign goods that have already been transacted. The Shanghai Hardware Parts Trade Association has noticed that the prices of various kinds of linked door locks sold by businesses are inconsistent. In order to standardize the prices, it convened a price evaluation committee meeting at its clubhouse on Tianjin Road at 3 PM yesterday. Chairman Wang Yuanzhang first reported the purpose of the meeting and the difficult situation of the industry. Then, he solicited the opinions of the committee members and officially set standard prices. Later, it was decided that the selling price of various hardware parts should be appropriately increased by 30% based on the price of the goods upon arrival. The selling prices are all detailed in regulations.</p>

<p>A total of five rice distribution points have been set up in the International Settlement and the French Concession. The directors of each location have been decided and the locations have been fully selected. Preparation began yesterday. The official sales will begin simultaneously on either this Saturday or next Monday. The locations are: (1) Vacant lot at the intersection of North Henan Road and Old Boundary Road. Tent construction started yesterday. (2) Vacant lot at the intersection of Avenue Road and Carter Road. Tent construction is scheduled to begin today. (3) Jade Buddha Temple on Pinlang Road. These locations are in the International Settlement. (4) Shandong Guild Hall at 249 Ximen Road. (5) Danjing Temple on Avenue Petain. These locations are in the French Concession. The total amount of rice for official sale is 8,000 bags, each bag containing one stone and two dou and a half. Among them, there are 1,000 bags of broken rice. The price of foreign rice is ten yuan per stone, and the price of broken rice is fourteen yuan per stone. Each person can purchase up to two yuan worth of rice. It has been decided that each location will initially issue 100 bags, and the distribution will continue until all 8,000 bags have been sold. The three-part tickets for the rice distribution have been printed and rice will be collected with tickets in the future. The distribution of broken rice will be carried out after the foreign rice has been sold out. The quality of the broken rice is the same as that of the foreign rice. At the time of the distribution, the settlement authorities will dispatch police officers to protect it. It is also reported that the Accountant Association's registration for ordering foreign rice has reached 10,000 bags. The initiators informed the association to inform all trade associations and manufacturers who have requested forms to register by Tuesday and Wednesday (i.e., today and tomorrow). Because the initiators believe that the amount ordered is sufficient, this batch of orders will be prioritized. Therefore, a meeting of subscribers will be convened this week. Registration after this time will have to be extended to the next batch before an order can be placed.</p>

<h3 id="e97">Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Wenzhou Shipping Lines Experience Difficulties; Shanghai-Oujiang Line Has Resumed Navigation; This Could Greatly Facilitate Cargo Transport to the Interior; Yingzhou Wheel to Sail Directly from Zhenhai to Hong Kong <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Oujiang line, which had been blockaded by the Japanese Navy and suspended for more than two months, has now resumed navigation. Taichangxiang's Xinxiangtai Wheel left Shanghai at noon on (day of the week) and is expected to arrive at the mouth of the Oujiang River this morning.</p>
<p>Following this, Yilong Company's Shenfu Wheel and Huatai Company's Xin'antong Wheel, managed by Huatai Company, are scheduled to depart for Wenzhou tomorrow (the 13th). If cargo handling procedures are not completed in time, it may be delayed by one day. The local authorities have been asked for approval. However, the movement of Japanese warships on the sea is uncertain, which is very important for the population problem. It is reported that Yijiang's Shen'ai Wheel is sailing directly from Keelung to Wenzhou and has now arrived there. Therefore, after the success of the trial voyage, it should greatly facilitate cargo transport to the interior. There should also be no concern about the supply of firewood and charcoal in this city. Although the cargo transport on the Ningbo line has improved compared to before, the loading and unloading of goods in Zhenhai Port is very inconvenient. Therefore, the ship's schedule has been delayed for a long time. Zhongyi Company's Ende Wheel returned to Shanghai the night before last (Sunday), after a round trip of three weeks. It is now scheduled to continue to Zhenhai Port on the morning of the 14th. It is reported that whether Moufu Wheel will return to Shanghai tomorrow (the upper third day) and continue sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route will be decided after the ship arrives in Shanghai. Far East Company's Hana Wheel will also return to Shanghai. Taikoo Company's Yingzhou Wheel is still in Zhenhai Port, waiting to unload cargo. It is reported that after the cargo from Ningbo is unloaded, the ship may not come to Shanghai and will sail directly to Hong Kong. Also, Xin'anna Wheel will sail directly from Shanghai to Zhenhai on the morning of the 14th.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Japanese Officials Visit French Police Station; All Circles, Do Not Lightly Listen to Rumors <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, there was a sudden, absurd, and laughable rumor in this city, claiming that an incident occurred at the Second Special District Court of the French Concession. This rumor is not worth mentioning, but for the sake of the deep concern of all circles, this reporter will publish the information obtained by the Xinhua News Agency to dispel the misunderstandings of all circles. It turns out that yesterday afternoon, at around 2 PM, four Japanese officials in plain clothes went to the French General Patrol Room in Lujiazui in car number 4758. It is reported that it was an ordinary courtesy visit. They left after a short time. The big rumor started from this.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Pseudo-Market Compresses the Meat Industry; Negotiations Continue <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The fresh meat industry in this city previously suspended operations due to unbearable pressure from the "Livestock Market" in Hongkou. After several negotiations, it finally received a reply from the council of the "Market," agreeing to stop brokers from arbitrarily raising market prices and from mixing second and third-class goods with first-class goods. Although the fresh meat industry felt that the reply was unsatisfactory, in order to take care of the needs of the citizens and reduce the losses of pig traders, it temporarily resumed full operations on the 7th of this month and continued negotiations at the same time. It is now learned that the industry will send personnel to Hongkou again tomorrow or the day after tomorrow with a letter, stating their position and not stopping until their goal is achieved. On the 7th and 8th of this month, the French Concession Slaughtering Industry Friendship Association published a notice, requesting the fresh meat industry to restore the "lottery" method agreed upon by the meat industry association before the 20th year of the Republic of China and the 18th year of the Republic of China, starting from the 14th of this month. The French Concession fresh meat industry has not yet received written notice from the association and does not know where the association is located or who is in charge. They believe that the lottery method has many abuses and is difficult to accept immediately. Therefore, they also published a notice today, stating their attitude.</p>

It is also reported that Judge Mooson opened a court session at the British Supreme Court this morning to hear reports from Lawyer Jones and others. It is heard that there is no concrete plan yet. The deliberation on the decision-making direction of the case is still under discussion and will not be stopped because the four Chinese suspects have been extradited to the "Chinese Court" under the jurisdiction of the Japanese. The case opened from morning to noon yesterday before adjourning the court.</p>

<p>Since the outbreak of the European war, commercial ships from various countries have been affected, resulting in delays in schedules. However, American ships are sailing as usual. Here are the recent trends of various postal ships:</p>
<p>President Lines, President Coolidge, departed from Los Angeles on the 21st of last month, passed through Japan, and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at noon today, berthed at buoy 11.12. The passenger tender, Mary Muller, will depart from the Xinguanyima Terminal at 12:00 noon today, and return to the Xinguanyima Terminal at 1:30 PM after picking up passengers. The ship is scheduled to leave on the morning of the 13th (tomorrow) at 7:30 AM for Hong Kong. The passenger tender is undecided. Tonight at midnight (i.e., morning of the 13th) at 1:00 AM, it will depart from the Xinguanyima Terminal. The ship will return to Shanghai from the United States on the 25th of this month.</p>
<p>Italian Lines, Conte Biancamano, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Genoa as per the original schedule, at noon today, berthed at the Gonghexiong Dock in Hongkou. The passenger tender will pick up Chinese passengers and take them to the Xinguanyima Terminal to disembark. It is heard that the ship also carries more than 500 Jewish people, who will disembark in Hongkou with the Western passengers. The ship was originally scheduled to return to Europe from Shanghai on the 14th. Since the company's Conte Rosso was delayed until the 14th, the sailing schedule of Conte Biancamano was slightly delayed. From a procedural point of view, it will be possible to return to Europe on the 11th. The company's Conte Rosso, which was originally berthed at the Gonghexiong Dock, has been there for many days. The morning before last (Saturday), because another ship was scheduled to berth at the dock, it sailed to Wusongkou for temporary anchorage. However, the export cargo has not been fully loaded. It is scheduled to return to the Huangpu River this morning, change berths to the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong to load cargo, and is scheduled to set sail on the morning of the 14th and return to Venice.</p>
<p>French Lines, the irregular ship Yangzi, arrived in Shanghai on the 5th of this month, berthed at the Qichang Warehouse in Pudong, and unloaded incoming cargo. It was originally scheduled to go to Japan on the 8th, but due to mechanical damage, it hired a craftsman to repair it. It has now been completed and is scheduled to export this morning and sail to Japan. It will return to Shanghai from Japan around the 25th of this month and return to Europe. According to the company yesterday, the cargo for return to Europe has already been booked in advance by various Hakka merchants. The tonnage of cargo to Haiphong and Saigon has also been filled. It is heard that the company will not load any transshipment cargo this time. The company's ships to Saigon are mostly handled by the China-France Express Company in this city. Because the company has intermodal transport relations, cargo to Kunming can be directly transported from Saigon to Kunming, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>British Company Far East Route, it is heard that no ship will come to Shanghai this month. It may be restored next month. The company's Indian line liner, Ellora (transliteration), arrived in Shanghai on the 1st of this month and has now gone to Japan. It will return to Shanghai on the 20th and is scheduled to leave from Shanghai on the 22nd for Mumbai.</p>
<p>Netherlands Java Company's Java route mail ship Tjillegonah has arrived at the port yesterday, berthed at buoy 10.13, and is scheduled to return to Surabaya on the 14th. The ship passes through Xiamen, Hong Kong, Singapore in Southeast Asia. Recently, due to the uncertainty of Taikoo's shipping schedule, most of the cargo to Hong Kong and Southeast Asia is reported to be loaded on the company's ships. Therefore, the business is exceptionally prosperous. It is heard that Tjillegonah has already been fully loaded, with Hong Kong cargo being the most numerous. In addition, the ships managed by Qiacheng Shenxing on Avenue Edward VII and Tongyi Shipping Company on the Bund are very crowded with passengers and cargo to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>In this city's two concessions, the daily rental of each rickshaw was 55 cents in national currency before the war. Since the outbreak of the war, various rickshaw companies have reduced it to about 40 cents to maintain the business of the rickshaw pullers. Unexpectedly, the prices of rubber, hardware parts, and other materials have soared by three to five times recently. In order to remedy this, various companies have agreed to increase the rental to 42 cents. At the same time, due to the rising rice prices, the lives of rickshaw pullers have been greatly affected. They have now invisibly increased the prices for passengers by an average of about 20% compared to before.</p>

<p>The Kunming Postal Administration of the Ministry of Transportation stated that since the Ministry of Finance issued the ban on the import of luxury goods during the emergency period, all postal packages sent to provinces and cities in the interior must be inspected by the local customs before they can be imported. In order to facilitate customs inspection, the administration has specially stipulated the delivery method. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired from the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday that "From now on, small postal packages sent to provinces and cities in the interior and forwarded by French Indochina should have a small strip or a tax return form affixed to each package, stating the value and nature of the contents for the reference of the Haiphong Customs. In addition to separately notifying the relevant departments, the Shanghai Postal Administration will also issue Announcement No. 1570.</p>

<h3 id="e108">European Sales Stagnate, Japanese Silk Competes; Silk Factories Will Stop Production; Raw Materials Also in Short Supply, Future Prospects Difficult to Be Optimistic; Value Plunged Due to the Influence of Easing Foreign Exchange <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Due to the lack of raw materials, only about 20 silk factories in Shanghai are勉强operating as of now. It is expected that all of them will stop production after the end of September. As for the foreign sales of Chinese silk, they have been affected by the European war. Sales to the United Kingdom and France have almost completely stopped. However, sales to the United States and the Philippines have not been affected. Prices have been affected by the easing of foreign exchange, resulting in a decline. Fortunately, they are now gradually rising again, but future prospects are difficult to be optimistic about, because the dumping of Japanese silk abroad is becoming more and more intense.</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Autumn Cocoons Begin to Enter the Market</p>
<p>The listing of fresh cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is divided into three periods each year: spring, summer, and autumn. However, spring cocoons are the most important. Autumn cocoons are second. The production of summer cocoons is not much and is not important. This year's autumn cocoons have already begun to enter the market in Zhejiang Province, and they can also enter the market in Jiangsu Province in a week. However, due to weather conditions, the harvest is less than that of spring cocoons. In cities where these autumn cocoons are controlled by the Japanese army, they are統制collected and purchased by the "China Silk Company." In townships, manufacturers are allowed to purchase freely, but it is stipulated that the cocoons collected by manufacturers must be given to the China Silk Company in half."</p>
<p>Shanghai Manufacturers Unwilling to Purchase</p>
<p>In view of the obstruction of the "China Silk Company" when purchasing spring cocoons this year, the silk reeling factories in the Shanghai concession were only allowed to transport half of them to Shanghai after repeated negotiations. Therefore, the manufacturers suffered significant losses. Therefore, they regard the purchase of autumn cocoons with fear and are unwilling to set up an office to purchase them. Although autumn cocoons have already entered the market, manufacturers have no preparations to collect cocoons. At the same time, the number of household silk factories in the interior has surged, and they are all collecting cocoons and reeling silk locally for the use of the interior silk factories.</p>

<p>— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>From the perspective of the country, marriage is mainly for giving birth to children and providing them with a good education. From an individual perspective, it is for maintaining a stable sex life. However, the meaning of marriage is not only that. It is important to form a social, economic, and spiritual unity. This unity, outwardly, manifests as a common, material life of mutual benefit. Inwardly, it shows the closeness of the spiritual relationship between husband and wife. Before marriage, it is necessary to have a lot of sympathy for each other; however, it is also common for the spiritual relationship to become closer after marriage due to sex life. Therefore, it is clear that marriage can affect men and women both spiritually and physically. According to statistics, the average human lifespan can be extended by marriage. This is because after marriage, life becomes regular, maintenance can be thorough, and there are also other good factors. At all ages, the number of deaths among unmarried people is always higher than that of married people.</p>
<p>Marriage is beneficial to the human body, which is undeniable. However, if the two sides have incompatible personalities or have problems with not being able to reproduce, they should change their partner. Otherwise, the harm is truly unimaginable, and parents must also deeply consider it. It is truly a sad and unfair thing for a purely white and healthy woman to marry an unworthy husband and someone who cannot be a father. It has a great impact on the health of the nation.</p>
<p>At the beginning of married life, because it is completely different from the solitary life before marriage, sometimes they will be excessively affectionate, indulging in excessive sex, which causes their health to decline. Over time, kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission, brain weakness, insomnia, and other symptoms are unavoidable. Those who suffer from this have a decline in their ability for sex, the married life cannot be coordinated, and love gradually becomes indifferent. The way to remedy this is to exercise restraint and start with increasing essence and nourishing blood. Those who have suffered from nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, kidney deficiency, and impotence before marriage can also use the same method, taking the German testicular essence preparation "Body-Comp" for men to achieve the functions of nourishing the kidneys, nourishing blood, nourishing essence, and nourishing the brain. This agent was invented by German physiologist Dr. Mering and has been used by more than 3,900 physicians around the world for experiments. All believe that it is a symptomatic medicine for treating sexual weakness and loss of health. The one for women also has the function of regulating menstruation and planting seeds. It is an effective medicine in gynecology.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn of Gonorrhea</p>
<h3 id="e111">Obtaining Practical Treatment for Gonorrhea <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine in the United States</p>
<p>For the treatment of diseases, its efficacy should be obvious. It is not necessary to use publicity methods to deceive patients. Instead, it should be shown with the truth of efficacy. The so-called fact is better than eloquence. For example, the medicine for treating gonorrhea must be in accordance with science in order to have true efficacy. Originally, gonorrhea has been a source of anxiety for general physicians, who have wanted to invent a special medicine, but have finally failed. However, the general public does not know about their own research failures, and sings about what trans-membrane sterilization, local therapy, etc., are all effects that have no practical effect. However, because there are many ignorant people, they are fortunate enough to gain popularity for a while, but soon they are broken by facts and disappear silently. The reason is that gonococcus is not only guarding the front and rear urethra, nor is it only固守the old position between the mucous membranes. It is a low-level bacteria that is good at escaping. It flows everywhere, so it also causes inflammation and pain everywhere, giving rise to various gonorrhea symptoms. For example, those who窜入the blood and滞于the joints will become arthritis. Those who窜入the urinary organs will develop cystitis. Those who窜入the internal reproductive organs will develop orchitis, etc. Most of the gonorrhea that has become such symptoms has been mistaken by gonorrhea medicine that has no practical effect.</p>
<p>Only Dr. Peter, a German master of gonorrhea, devoted his life's efforts to invent and use a mixture of protein and yellow pigment to make the "Klinon" medicine, which is famous all over the world today. After taking this agent, it can cause the whole body's cells to produce anti-gonorrheal phagocytic effects. Its bactericidal power directly reaches the lesion. Wherever there is gonococcus, the bactericidal effect of "Klinon" will occur. Therefore, regardless of whether it is early gonorrhea or long-term gonorrhea, and regardless of whether it is male or female, they can all take "Klinon" and be cured without any adverse side effects. For external use in men, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used to wash the urethra. For women, "Karell Shedi's Vaginal Tablets" can be used as suppositories to achieve great success.</p>
<h3 id="e112">A Secret Formula for Relieving Coughs and Curing Lung Ailments <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>— By Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Whether in traditional Chinese or Western medicine, coughs are considered a difficult ailment to treat. Consequently, lung diseases are far more prevalent than any other infectious disease, and their mortality rate is truly alarming. Therefore, the general public should not regard a cold and cough as a minor ailment and neglect treatment. Even if one unfortunately progresses from an incurable cough to lung disease, one should not be pessimistic. In reality, lung diseases are not as fearsome as most doctors claim. As long as one takes care of their health and receives proper treatment, there is nothing mysterious about it. Based on my experience, the medicine "Bu Fei Na Er" is highly effective in relieving coughs and treating lung ailments. Even cases of hemoptysis (coughing up blood) in the second or third stage can be completely cured with this medicine. However, during the recovery period, it is important to rest and avoid strenuous activities, and to consume plenty of nutritious food. In this way, the ailment can be easily cured. These are the essential conditions for healing from pulmonary tuberculosis.</p>

<p>— By Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>A patient named Lu Rujing, from Jiashan, 21 years old, stated: "My body is generally healthy, but I had enuresis (bedwetting) as a child, which only stopped at the age of fourteen. When I was sixteen, I entered a private middle school and, influenced by older classmates in the same dormitory, I developed the bad habit of masturbation—performing it several times every night. This greatly depleted my essence and blood. After about half a year, I started involuntarily masturbating in my sleep, leading to spermatorrhea (involuntary ejaculation). Because my family was not wealthy, I did not seek treatment, and I could not completely quit the habit of masturbation. After a year, I developed neurasthenia (nervous weakness), insomnia, and memory loss. I was extremely worried and, influenced by advertisements, I purchased and took some kind of sperm-strengthening pills. While they were temporarily effective, spermatorrhea and seminal emission recurred as soon as I stopped taking them. Realizing I had been deceived, I didn't know what to do. Now, on the recommendation of a friend, I have come for treatment." (Treatment process) - I instructed him to completely abstain from masturbation, strictly adhere to health preservation, maintain a pure mind and few desires, and prescribed "Nairisi Spermatorrhea Pills" to fundamentally cure his spermatorrhea. Additionally, I prescribed "Bu Ti Kang" for men to replenish his deficiencies. After twelve weeks of treatment, the spermatorrhea has ceased, his spirit has greatly improved, he sleeps soundly, and his weight and appetite have significantly increased.</p>

<p>Everyone knows that gonorrhea is a highly dreaded venereal disease. However, many people, due to their physiological urges or psychological needs, often engage in this risky game. As a result, they often contract white discharge (a symptom of gonorrhea). Once infected with this disease, distressing symptoms appear. If they encounter incompetent doctors and inferior medicine at this early stage, the bacteria will be pushed inward, leading to various prostatitis, seminal vesiculitis, and other conditions, which are the consequences of untreated gonorrhea patients. Because the infectivity of these gonorrhea toxins is extremely high, if one has contact with their spouse before being cured, the innocent spouse will also suffer from this promiscuous disease. Is this not a tragedy? Therefore, I always advise people to pay special attention to this disease. Otherwise, they will create a catastrophe, not only harming their spouses but also destroying their life's happiness, which is truly regrettable. However, in many situations, one should be aware that since this disease is very difficult to treat, one should seek treatment from the most experienced doctor at the onset to avoid the aggravation of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment of general gonorrhea, most people are short-sighted, only seeking superficial effects and proclaiming them as good medicine. They do not know that such over-the-counter medicines often delay treatment, leading to more complications and making it more difficult to manage. Over the past twenty years, I have encountered many cases where patients could not be cured by taking over-the-counter antibacterial and chemical therapy drugs. I instructed them to take the gonorrhea-specific drug "Kelinong," and also used German static electricity therapy and anti-gonorrhea serum, which can quickly achieve remarkable results for gonorrhea patients. It has been tested hundreds of times with no failures. Therefore, while patronizing prostitutes is risky entertainment, seeking medical treatment and taking medicine carelessly is even riskier. Consultation hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, twenty appointment numbers will be given out daily, with each number costing only five jiao.</p>

<p>Zhuo Cichong, a native of Ningbo, 34 years old, who lives at No. 253 Zhao Zhujiao Road, French Concession, and runs a securities business in a company building, was driving his own car, No. 11918, along Avenue Edward VII, heading east to west, at 5:20 p.m. on August 1st of this year. Due to the driver's negligence, he hit Madam Chen Li, the wife of Cantonese man Chen Qin, who was walking in the same direction in front of the car, injuring her vital parts.</p>
<p>She died instantly. The police took the body to the coroner's office and reported it to the Second Special Court to send someone to examine it. The family collected the body, and Zhuo asked someone to mediate with the deceased's family and compensate them for the considerable damage. He also asked someone to request leniency from the authorities. However, the French police believed that Zhuo had not paid attention while driving, resulting in a major disaster, so they sent Zhuo to the Second Special Court. The French Concession authorities filed a public prosecution for negligent homicide.</p>
<p>The initial trial found the defendant Zhuo Cihui responsible for the crime and sentenced him to two years in prison. During the appeal period, he was allowed to post a substantial bail and be available on call. Zhuo refused to accept the verdict and hired a lawyer to file an appeal with the Third High Court. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi, along with Judges Wu Xiangzu and Gu Hongbiao, and Prosecutor Zhao Changming, formed a collegial panel to hear the case. The French Concession authorities were represented by lawyer Yao Zhaodi in court. According to the appellant Zhuo Cihui,</p>
<p>The grounds for the appeal stated that when his car was refueling a few days before the accident, the machinery was inspected to be intact, but suddenly the machinery broke down when he left the village, making it uncontrollable, resulting in the accident. Subsequently, his defense lawyer defended him, arguing that the appellant's car had a sudden accident, which was understandable. Moreover, he had a heavy family burden. If he were to be imprisoned, the family's livelihood would be affected. He requested to be acquitted. The court verified the statements and announced the end of the debate, setting the judgment for the 18th. The appellant was ordered to add a store guarantee of 1,000 yuan pending review.</p>

<p>Jiang Jianqiu, a notorious thief, was released from prison this spring. Not long after, he committed dozens of cases of luring prostitutes, dancers, Kunqu actresses, tour guide girls, and wealthy family concubines to steal their money and jewelry, as well as theft and robbery in the British and French concessions. In early May, he was arrested by the Public Concession Police and sentenced to five years in prison by the First Special Court. Subsequently, he was transferred to the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court by the French Police Department for prosecution according to law. Judge Qiu HuanYing sentenced Jiang Jianqiu to nine years in prison for robbery. Jiang expressed dissatisfaction with the robbery charge and hired lawyer Zhang Danping to file an appeal with the Third High Court. The case was heard by a collegial panel of Criminal Division Chief Wu Yanqi, along with Gu Hongbiao and Wu Xiangzu. Yesterday was the date for the verdict. Chief Judge Wu still presided over the Third Criminal Court and ruled that the original verdict be revoked. Jiang Jianqiu was sentenced to six years of imprisonment for robbery. Jiang claimed in court that although the sentence was now reduced, the crime he committed was not robbery. It was entirely given to him by the victims. He said he would consider hiring lawyer Zhang to appeal again. After the statement was completed, he was still escorted to prison by the police.</p>

<p>On the 30th of this month, Father An of the Tushanwan Catholic Church was suddenly strangled to death by bandits using ropes. Afterwards, the French police dispatched detectives to track down the perpetrators. On the evening of the 9th of this month, around 9 p.m., Ju Bailang (25 years old), the main culprit in the case, a local, knowing that he could not escape punishment, went to the St. Peter's Church on Luban Road to surrender. After learning of this, the police immediately sent detectives to detain the criminal. The following is an excerpt from the French police's account of the case, which was released yesterday. According to the investigation, the criminal Ju had served in the printing press of the Tushanwan Orphanage since he was eight years old. Before February, he was expelled by the orphanage for being lazy. Now, the criminal Ju has confessed that he and several accomplices planned to murder Father An and rob him of his money. On the morning of August 30th, Ju and several of his accomplices went to the orphanage to see Father An, claiming that they had brought an orphan here on August 28th and did not know if he could be admitted. While speaking, several accomplices were watching outside, and the rest entered Father An's room. At that time, two thugs rushed at Father An, tied him tightly with ropes, and stuffed cotton in his mouth. At this time, Ju and his accomplices intended to open the iron box, but they did not succeed. So they stole 200 yuan in cash from the drawer. However, most of the cash was from North China provinces, so it was not easy to use in this city. Now, the criminal Ju has confessed that he was the main culprit in the case and has identified the faces, origins, etc. of his accomplices. It is expected that the remaining members of the gang will be arrested soon.</p>

<p>The Zhongnan Leather Factory on Anhe Temple Road in Huxi was established by Pan Shanglin (51 years old, from Dinghai), who lives at No. 116 Wenlin Road, and others who raised funds and formed a partnership. The management office is located in Pan's home. Now, Pan has entrusted a lawyer to sue Wu Zengfang and Wang Shiying, the former managers of the factory, for embezzlement in the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. According to the claim, the plaintiff previously gave 6,600 yuan to the second defendant, Wang Shiying, to be used by the first defendant, Wu Zengfang, to issue a receipt for purchasing goods in Jiangbei. Only 3,231.5 yuan worth of goods were delivered. The remaining 3,368.5 yuan has not been accounted for for a long time. There is a joint embezzlement. The plaintiff requested that the court investigate the matter according to law. According to the complaint, Judge Zhang Minsheng opened a court hearing in the afternoon of yesterday. The plaintiff was represented by a lawyer to state the previous situation. The second defendant was absent. The first defendant, Wu Zengfang, arrived with his defense lawyer and confessed that the plaintiff gave the money to Wang Shiying to purchase goods in Jiangbei. He was only a manager and issued a receipt. Everything was handled by the two of them. The plaintiff was very satisfied with the first batch of goods that arrived in Shanghai and asked them to purchase more. The latter batch of goods could not be transported to Shanghai, so someone was sent to manage them, costing more than 2,000 yuan in food and accommodation expenses, which led to disputes. Wang Shiying has gone to Kunming and has not returned. Please investigate. After reviewing the statements, the court decided to postpone the hearing to the 20th.</p>

<p>Korean Sun Wenze (31 years old) recently set up a morphine den in a pavilion room on the second floor of No. 81, Dakang Lane, Kang Ti Road, French Concession. It was unexpectedly raided by eight bandits at 4:30 p.m. yesterday. Three bandits guarded the door, and five went straight to the pavilion room. At that time, only Sun and his wife, Ms. Wang (Chinese), were in the room. Because the business was prohibited, the door was always closed. Seeing that the door would not open, the bandits used a hammer to break down the door and swarmed in. Seeing this, Sun jumped out of the window in panic and fell to the ground, suffering serious injuries. The bandits forced Sun's wife to open the iron box and robbed her of 2,000 yuan in cash. Afterwards, Sun, injured, reported the incident to the French police, who sent detectives to the scene. However, the bandits had already fled without a trace.

<p>To the Editor: Regarding the news item in your newspaper's news column on the 10th of this month, "Daughter-in-law Hiding in Lawyer Yang's House," which is inconsistent with the facts, I hereby briefly state the following. According to Zhu Wangshi, around 2 p.m. on the 7th of this month, she first led a woman from Jiangbei to my house, and then went to the Xujiahui French Police Station to falsely accuse me of assault. After the police station investigated clearly, it was found that the incident stemmed from a previous grudge, and Song Wangshi was not present. The police station had no witnesses or injuries. I requested that she be charged with false accusation. The police chief advised me to settle the matter and drop the case. Unexpectedly, Song Wangshi, Song Wen, and his mother led thirty or forty hooligans, male and female, to break into my house around 7 p.m. on the same day. At that time, I was out and had not returned home. While Song Wangshi and the hooligans were causing a disturbance, Zhang Zhiqing and his daughter Shunbao were summoned by Mao Bentang of Xujiahui Catholic Church to call me. Song Wangshi and others immediately clashed with them and deliberately damaged my reputation. Subsequently, both parties were taken to the police station. After being released, they led hooligans, male and female, to Zhang Zhiqing's house around 10 p.m. on the same day, broke down the door and made trouble. Gang police then brought Song Wangshi, Zhang Zhiqing, and others to the police station and ordered them to be detained. At this time, Song Wangshi feigned injury and falsely accused me of assault, which is the truth. I hereby request your newspaper to publish it in the letter column to clarify the truth and avoid inaccuracies. Sincerely, Lawyer Yang Yiming, 28.9.10. To the Editor: After reading the section in your newspaper about the university professor accusing the lawyer of defamation, I found that the parties involved in this case, Zhang Guanghe, etc., found that the common ancestral grave site in Tushanwan was privately leased to Renyu Dyeing and Weaving Factory by Da Fang Yucang without authorization. After unsuccessful negotiations, the issue was resolved through legal means, and the lessee is still actively carrying out the work. The declaration published by the appointed representative is legally justified, and Zhang Yucang suddenly filed a criminal lawsuit, claiming that it was a false accusation, and even found that the lease was not disputed. Claiming that it was a false accusation, it cannot be specified as a slander. There is an intention to deliberately falsely accuse. It is hoped that your newspaper will clarify this issue. Sincerely, Lawyer Tang Yingsong, September 10.</p>

<h3 id="e133">A Brief Discussion on Intellectuals <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Chang</p>
<p>Intellectuals mostly come from the petty bourgeoisie or small landlord class. They lack a solid economic foundation but possess class characteristics. In terms of status, they are like ordinary petty bourgeois: easily able to climb up or fall down.</p>
<p>Because they possess knowledge, they are particularly sensitive in special times and societies, appearing with the most active stance. They can merge with the masses, yet in general situations, they unintentionally or intentionally reveal their inherent nature. In the long process, sometimes a burst of courage is difficult to sustain, so they will fall behind, decline, or even withdraw or rebel: Bukharin, Trotsky, Zinoviev, Radek, weren't they the most respectable comrades at first? In the end, they all formed a different page in revolutionary history.</p>
<p>Petty-bourgeois intellectuals are also mostly prone to melancholy: looking at the upper class, they see extravagance and shamelessness, which are truly appalling, so they take the world as their responsibility and resolutely take on their sacred mission. Once they penetrate the ranks, they feel that others are too ordinary and crude, and they cannot perform their work satisfactorily, almost like Demosthenes on the battlefield. So they hesitate, waver, shed tears, lament, get angry, and become loners. However, they also value themselves too much – they have knowledge, are superior to ordinary people, and are uniquely blessed by heaven. Therefore, they often become psychological individualist heroes. Naturally, these heroes mostly lack the masses, so their power is weak. They are indeed too isolated, and a part of them, subjectively, act as the mainstay, possessing arrogance, disdaining to become "vassals" of the ruling class; their evaluation is "keeping themselves clean."</p>
<p>Putting oneself first is certainly seen as a good quality of intellectuals in general; intellectuals without ambition will even engage in vassal-like activities, like Jia Yucun in *Dream of the Red Chamber* reciting loudly: "Jade in the cabinet seeks a good price, Qin in the casket waits for the time to fly." Isn't this just the ideology of the feudal literati? Even now, some still hold such thoughts of fame and gain.</p>
<p>In this situation, lonely intellectuals must at least hold on to "keeping themselves clean," right? But intellectuals should have courage and faith and should not merely focus on "keeping themselves clean." Then they must also take a step further from "loneliness": Zhang Taiyan once used a large Dong Zhang as a fan pendant, went to the gate of the Presidential Palace, and loudly scolded Yuan Shikai for harboring evil intentions. This was truly an expression of blood and courage, enough to delight people's hearts! There was an objective effect. However, Zhang's power at that time was lonely; a thunderclap did not allow for a louder sound. Why? It may not have been because he was far from the masses.</p>
<p>Intellectuals should realize that their power must be invested in the ranks of the masses: breathing the breath of the masses, acting the actions of the masses. In this way, they will rationally overcome bad habits and lonely habits and create themselves as warriors of the times. It is good that they have Byron's sense of justice in fighting for freedom, and it is even smarter to have Barbusse's understanding of the wrongness of fighting for aggression. This is precisely the excellent and outstanding aspect of intellectuals.</p>
<p>Occasionally, one might think: "White herons fly before Mount Xisai, peach blossoms flow with plump mandarin fish," this is certainly also sensitivity; but the main thing is how to eliminate Feng Xuan's utilitarian view of a "no fish to eat, strumming the sword and chanting" bankrupt intellectual. If this kind of poison is fostered, one will eventually follow in the footsteps of "immortal Liaoyang."</p>
<p>In fact, it is undesirable for intellectuals to be too self-important and become individualists, and it is even more likely to bury themselves if they are too self-deprecating and become defeatists. Excellent, awakened intellectuals are often upright leaders of the masses. There are historical precedents for this: Sun Yat-sen and Ulyanov are two models. They are not "vassals" – helping and abetting evil – nor are they lonely, nor do they lack courage and faith, and these are indeed the most important conditions for intellectuals. It is because intellectuals have the latter two in a positive way that their ideals, feelings, and actions will coordinate and be common with everyone, so that they will not fall into a deep pit, be broken, or get into a dead end and be stifled.</p>
<h3 id="e134">A Heroic Cook <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>—War Zone Reminiscence—</p>
<p>On the way back, Dushan fell. This bad news reached Guanyindong, and everyone looked at each other blankly and felt a bit inexplicable. "How could it be lost so quickly?" It seemed to be an unanswerable mystery; because the fortifications on the front line were quite solid, and we had seen with our own eyes the courage of the defending soldiers to coexist with the position. Moreover, the terrain in the vicinity was very steep, with a commanding view. So, what was the reason for the fall? It is truly heartbreaking to say. When the enemy's plainclothes team had already appeared in Youfangdian, the self-defense corps guarding the northern hilltop was unprepared. When they woke up from their dreams, it was too late to "defend" themselves and they were completely wiped out. At the same time, the enemy also got the lead of the local ghosts, detoured in from the side, and the defending soldiers were caught off guard. Although they resisted desperately, they ran out of ammunition and were cut off from reinforcements, so they fulfilled their oath and completely sacrificed heroically. Only one cook survived. He took the gun from the hand of a dead comrade, fired the last bullet, and then crawled into the deep valley after his leg had been "colored." He was rescued by the people.</p>
<p>Therefore, the failure to defend the eastern front for a long time was first due to the inaction of the security team, and second due to the self-defense corps abandoning their responsibility. As for the ghosts willingly becoming accomplices, it was certainly also a fatal wound to the fall of Dushan. But we must not hide the reason why the ghosts were brought to the door, which was created by the self-defense corps. Their members were local ruffians, without training or discipline. As for the officers, most of them were "good fellows in the green forest." The so-called "sharing gold and silver in large scales" was the only central idea. The author dares not slander them. Such a counterfeit team not only cannot increase the strength of the war of resistance but also sometimes blurs the people's understanding of the enemy and ourselves, and weakens the driving force of military-civilian cooperation. General Liao Lei said: "The people's self-defense army in western Anhui must be thoroughly reorganized. In addition to military training, it is necessary to pay attention to political training, so that it can become a true people's armed force, and it will be able to shoulder the heavy burden of defending the hometown happily." General Liao's words were indeed realized later.</p>
<p>The day we met the cook, he was sleeping quietly in the hospital in the eastern suburbs of the mountain city. The wound had already healed, but his face was still pale, which was due to too much blood loss. After talking, we learned that his name was Zhang Caisheng, from Zhuoxian, Hebei. "Home? Please don't ask me about this! Before the devils withdraw from the country, I don't want anything, home, this tiring thing!" He replied indignantly, his eyes wide open. Then, he said that when the doctor allowed him to leave the hospital, he would go back to the team immediately to avenge his dead comrades.</p>
<p>"Okay, brave friend, I wish you eternal victory, goodbye!"</p>
<p>He smiled and stretched out a hard hand, shaking ours tightly.</p>

<p>— Xu Ye</p>
<p>Flower</p>
<p>In the early morning, I found a brilliant flower on my desk.</p>
<p>Who sent this flower?</p>
<p>Listening to the shouts of the flower girls passing through the deep alleys, I understood: the flower was sent by her.</p>
<p>In the past, I loved flowers, and I liked to smell the fragrance of flowers. Now, I have changed. A beautiful rose or a delicate jasmine cannot stimulate my heart.</p>
<p>The desk is messy: there are books, poems, and pens on display there. All of this seems too monotonous, and it is necessary to add a bunch of flowers to form a beautiful and harmonious pattern.</p>
<p>However, the flowers picked from the branches have lost their preciousness and rarity. They may have color, but they are not as bright red and lively as a drop of blood!</p>
<p>I am sure: fresh blood will definitely form beautiful wonders. It is the most precious thing in the world. If there is this on a monotonous case, then there will be vitality. So I hope someone can bring back a few flowers from the front line. I really want to be greatly inspired. I need to be filled with life.</p>
<p>I know I'm just dreaming: there's no such thing readily available in the world; the wonders of fresh blood must be created by brave warriors. Will it be sent to a lonely person as a desk decoration?</p>
<p>But I finally left a note outside the door; writing:</p>
<p>"Don't send flowers tomorrow."</p>
<p>Since then, the flower girl has come, only to return silently and without words.</p>
<p>Family Letter</p>
<p>Like a swallow skimming across the waves, a long-distance family letter cuts off a piece of longing.</p>
<p>Home, one word, one meaning, endless local accents from both places, separated by clouds, mountains, rivers, and seas, I have extreme joy.</p>
<p>Unable to see the face of my hometown, the letter says: the homeland has been ravaged, beacon fires are everywhere, and the fields have been turned into scorched earth under the railway. However, the mountains, the layers of peaks, flutter our great flag, the guerrilla队伍 is marching, everyone is struggling hard.</p>
<p>After reading the family letter, reluctantly, I read it until it was hot, not letting every word be easily forgotten. Perhaps, it seems that a poet once said: "A family letter is worth a thousand gold," now, I love reading this sentence very much, even if it is the price of ten thousand gold.</p>
<p>Remembering friends holding guns in the distance: Jin, Neng, Qi - they put on military uniforms, braved the wind and rain of eastern Guangdong, galloping in the fields of their hometowns, one head care, one gun! I wish them well, their health, the coming day of the hometown will certainly belong to us.</p>
<p>I will use infinite heat to repay the hard struggle of my friends, I want to work</p>
<p>Waiting again for the second family letter, looking up to the endless sky and sea...</p>

<h3 id="e138">Two Anecdotes About Cui Lingzhi and Shisan Dan <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<p>—Both Actors Arrived in Shanghai at the End of the Qing Dynasty</p>
<p>Cui Lingzhi and Shisan Dan (Hou Junshan) were both famous Bangzi Dan actors thirty years ago. They have passed away for a long time, and it seems that there is no value in recalling them. However, when Cui and Hou were famous in the opera world, their sharpness was very strong, no different from today's Mei Lanfang. Li Chunke's "Yue Mantang Diary" records that the Minister of Internal Affairs of the capital, Wen Xi, hosted a banquet for Prince Gong until midnight and refused to stop. He insisted on summoning the Western actor Shisan Dan to perform two operas. He ordered the magistrate of Wanping to come quickly. Before he finished speaking, Shisan Dan arrived. Minister Wan immediately left his seat and sat on his knees in a flattering manner to greet him, saying, "Why are you so late? You almost offended your followers. Please don't be offended. Quickly put on your makeup to comfort the hungry and thirsty." The situation was like this. How could the court survive? We have nowhere to die. Li Chunke's feelings were like this, which can also prove that Shisan Dan was valued by the Qing court ministers. Another notebook records the story of Cui Lingzhi, saying that a certain Beijing official, a romantic seed, mistakenly thought Cui was a male actor disguised as a female, and invited many literati to a banquet in a restaurant. At the end of the banquet, the guests dispersed, but Lingzhi did not leave. The Beijing official wanted to flirt with her during the seat, but Cui slapped him in the face and left with a flick of his sleeve. The above two anecdotes will definitely be considered very interesting by opera fans.</p>
<p>Cui Lingzhi and Shisan Dan both came to Shanghai to perform before the Republic of China, and the only supporting roles I can remember are Ma Quanlu and Liu Zengyi. I don't dare to guess who else was a supporting role. Zuo Wansheng's "Pink Ink Gossip" records Shisan Dan: "Shisan Dan was famous for his beauty in Yantai. The people of the capital followed the trend and competed to fall in love with him. Officials and scholars often filled the seats. After returning to Shanghai by boat, he performed at the Dangui Teahouse. His Xin'an Station was really amazing. In a few months, he returned to the capital. Recently, there was a flying flower, and I don't know where it flowed to the end of the world. Alas, can I see him again?" According to the book "Pink Ink Gossip," its preface records that the year of Guangxu was the year of the strong prison Dayuan dedicated Zou month hope day. Because there was no Erya available on the case in the hotel, but Hou Junshan's arrival in Shanghai during the Guangxu period has indeed been seen in the writings of predecessors. Also, in the year of Xinhai, my friend Wang Jun Hanshen, who was old enough to be my father, fled from Hankou to my hometown, rented a house next to mine, and often talked to me about the affairs of the opera troupe after dinner. He was a member of the Banner, who had lived in Shanghai and Hankou for a long time, and told me that Cui Lingzhi performed his proud masterpiece Loyalty and Righteousness in Shanghai in a certain year (referring to before the Republic of China). Wang Jun said that he had never shed tears when listening to songs in his life, but he cried when he watched Cui perform. Shisan Dan seemed to have come to Shanghai again after the Republic of China. The place seemed to be Dangui First Stage. There are many senior opera fans in Shanghai. After seeing this article, they will definitely be able to indicate the year when the two actors came to Shanghai, which is also a proof of the stories of the opera garden.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Zhang Yipeng and Jin Suqin Cooperate? <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Taibai</p>
<p>—Xindu Hotel Will Form a Ping Opera Theater</p>
<p>In the past two days, a strange news has been rumored outside - the news of Zhang Yipeng and Jin Suqin's cooperation.</p>
<p>Since Jin Suqin returned to Shanghai last month, she has lived in seclusion and rarely interacted with the outside world. One is that her jade body is unwell and she needs to rest, and the other is that Jin Suqin is reluctant to give up her original intention of improving Ping opera, and she does not have a satisfactory base in Shanghai to form a troupe temporarily. If Lin Shusen's Lin Opera Troupe is being re-staged, there was originally news of cooperation with Jin Suqin, but it ultimately failed to become a reality. So, where did the rumors of cooperation with Zhang Yipeng that have been circulating in the past two days come from?</p>
<p>It turned out that at the beginning of the opening of the Xindu Hotel, in addition to the Glass Radio Station and the Xiao Wenbin Shen Opera Theater, it was planned to organize a Ping opera theater with more appeal. Many opera troupe members had opened a "list" to the authorities, but it was either too ideal or the prestige was not enough. Recently, Monkey King Zhang Yipeng resigned from the stage at the Grand Theater. Zhang Yipeng has sung more than 30 "Journey to the West", leaving a deep impression on the audience's meninges in Shanghai, so perhaps someone moved his mind and also turned to Jin Suqin. If the two of them can cooperate, it is indeed very confident in the "business eye". But this is also an overly ideal plan, and the chances of it being realized are very small. However, it seems very urgent for the Xindu Hotel to organize a Ping opera theater now.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Celebrities Acting in Spoken Drama? Who Says It Shouldn't Be Done? <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Yu</p>
<p>Many of the people who acted in the "Sunrise" stage play this time were friends from the screen, such as Lu Luming, Lan Lan, Zhou Manhua, Bai Yan, Shushi, Gong Jianong, Zhou Qi, Bai Yun and others. It is said that many comrades who specialize in spoken drama are a bit shaking their heads, thinking that [screen actors] are too free and too close to vulgarity, and that it is not advisable to use the title of "movie star" as a gimmick for spoken drama.</p>
<p>This is the reason, but it is only half of it. I think: spoken drama does not necessarily have to use movie stars as a gimmick, but once they become screen actors, they (she) must not lose their right to be on stage because of this. In short, for those who have acting talent, we do not have to discriminate against them regardless of whether they have been on the screen or not.</p>
<p>After watching "Sunrise", I feel that Lu Luming, Shushi, Gong Jianong, Zhou Youhua and others all have commendable stage acting skills, and the "screen newcomer" Lan Lan cannot be rejected because she has been on stage. This is my humble opinion.</p>
<p>Norma Shearer's new costume in the movie *The Women*, was designed by Adrian. The style is elegant, and the belt is inlaid with gorgeous lace, making her look lively and exquisite. This dress can very well highlight her beauty.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Record of the Opening Ceremony of the New Chunqiu Opera School <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Chou Cheng</p>
<p>The New Chunqiu Drama School founded by Pan Wangji's daughter Qichuang held its opening ceremony on the ninth of this month. Because this kind of school is similar to the Beijing class and is rare in the South, I went to visit it, and I will record the trivial things I saw in this journal. The auditorium of the school is very well布置. On the wall hangs a silk plaque with red background and gold flowers given by Yu Tingsun, the director of the school, with the words "Promote Fine Arts" written on it. More than 30 students, such as Zhang Shunhua and Chen Liyun, are all energetic and happy. The three principals of Pan Wangji, He Zhiyang, and Chen Dabei (one formal and two deputy) and teachers Yan Gongshang and Li Junqing are sitting on the stage. Pan Wangji injured her throat due to a cold. In addition to distributing the school badges to the students, she did not speak. The words she wanted to say were all conveyed by the two vice principals. He said that the singing and acting skills of Ping opera are too old-fashioned and do not know how to improve. Everything about spoken drama has its drawbacks. The purpose of founding this school is to integrate the new and old dramas, take their essence, and discard their dross, so as to become a new type of opera that can be considered satisfactory by the top, middle and lower classes of the audience. I hope that the guests and students will all understand the good intentions of the organizers who love opera art. Chen's speech was quite long, so I will omit it. Yan Gongshang and Li Junqing also gave speeches one after another. A Mandarin teacher explained in detail the relationship between Ping opera and Mandarin. A screenwriter expert explained the psychology of screenwriting and actors, which was very moving. Finally, Wang Shensheng, a famous amateur actor, gave a speech, listing his own experience in Ping opera, spoken drama, and movies. He danced and gesticulated,突梯滑稽, vivid and colorful, no less than performing a one-man show. Everyone applauded, and then they went to the playground to take a photo and the meeting ended.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Afterwards, I researched with Xin Fang. I said that this person is too strange. He himself is famous in Tianjin as an amateur Qingyi singer of Erhuang. He is neither famous for the flute nor have I heard that he is proficient in Kunqu Opera. However, he is willing to take out money to train many flute masters and also support a Mr. Shen at home. This is really inexplicable! At that time, Xin Fang replied: "I once heard Zhou Wushi say that one of our colleagues (Kun troupe) once went to Guanwai. At first, he made a little money by getting some antiques, and supported his son to graduate from university. Now I heard that he has become a very big official and is very rich." After listening to Xin Fang's words, and carefully studying the high remarks made by a certain mayor at the table that day, we couldn't help but say in unison: "The so-called 某笛师 的 son, or else it is him."</p>
<p>Wang Keqin's Separation and Reunion with Zhang Xun</p>
<p>In the early years of the Republic of China, the military was domineering and formed a situation of carving out a territory. Zhang Xun was the most vocal and influential. He occupied Xuzhou for several years. The soldiers under his command were undisciplined and unruly, like a king of one side. Although the government issued orders, Zhang treated everything as a mere formality. Because he always remembered the Qing Dynasty, he staged the conference of military governors. Zhang moved to restore the Qing Dynasty. Wen Shengren (Kang Youwei) covered his face with a芭芜扇 to escape, and Wu Shengren hid in the Netherlands to avoid disaster. Zhang Xun himself was a rough person, but his only advantage was that he did not forget his roots. I have already told the story of him and the old Thirteen Dan. Just from this point, it can be seen that this person is very mindful of old friendships.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Shirley Temple's New Work "The Little Craftsman" Will Soon Be Completed <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>—Released in China in October</p>
<p>Hollywood child star Shirley Temple looks very lively and cute. She has golden hair and blue eyes. She is ten years old this year. At the age of three, she appeared on the screen and starred in short films. Because of her excellent performance, she was reused and filmed feature films.</p>
<p>She is a powerful mainstay of Fox, and has acted in as many as nineteen films in five or six years. Each film is very profitable, so the company attaches special importance to her. The titles of her films mostly begin with the word "Little". Like "Little Miss Marker", "Little Miss Broadway", "Little Lord Fauntleroy", "Little Colonel", "Little Rebel", "Little Heidi" and the recently released "The Little Princess" and the colored film "The Little Princess" that has just been completed.</p>
<p>Following "The Little Princess", is "The Little Craftsman", which was specially written for her by Lin Yutang, a master of Chinese humor. The film started shooting in Hollywood last month and is scheduled to be completed within forty days. Probably in October of this year, the film will be released in China.</p>
