<h3 id="c7">日本的政治陰謀 <a href="#c7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>日本侵略中國，因在軍事進展上遇到困難，便不得不運用政治陰謀以策動和平，企圖分化中國抗日的陣綫，削弱抗戰的實力，而在勝利的條件下結束戰事。這樣不僅可以消化已得的利益，而且足以瓦解中國的團結，使中國內部又回復到抗戰前的紛爭狀態，於是可乘機從事更進一步的侵略。這種陰謀，雖屢爲中國堅强的抗日陣綫所粉碎，可是迄今不獨仍未絕跡，反和日本軍事進展困難程度的增高成正比例地熾烈起來了。</p>
<p>自抗戰轉入第二階段以後，日本對華的軍事不獨毫無進展，反益陷入困境。要進攻西北，則一敗於晋西，再敗於晋南，渡河企圖全成泡影；要打通粵漢路，則北既頓挫於湘鄂邊境，南又阻滯於花縣新街；要進襲西南，則又不能越北海三水。而各游擊區域，華方游擊隊異常活躍，隨時隨地予以襲擊，以致窮於應付，進退維谷。不但如此，她自發動戰爭以來，國內財政已陷於山窮水盡之境，通貨膨脹，物價騰貴，民不聊生，反戰情緒日益高漲，很多大學敎授因反對戰爭而被捕，左翼各黨又大規模發動反戰運動。這些事實使日本統治者也痛感對華長期作戰的不利，於是便以策動和平的陰謀，爲其死裏求生的途徑。一面趁着英大使巡視華北的機會，假借華北民衆團體及在野名流的名義，發出通電，呼籲和平。一面利用「德義軸心」，派貴族院議員松田，衆議院議員藏圓等來華。向義國駐華大使疏通，請他爲中日戰爭，出任調停。正在這個時候，德國因急切希望日本在華獲得勝利，便在重慶散佈「德蘇親善」「反共協定」將成廢紙的姻慕，企圖藉此離間中蘇友誼，鬆懈中國的抗戰工作。</p>
<p>日本所以要趁英大使巡視華北的機會，假借名義，通電籲和，目的除在分化中國的抗戰陣綫外，還想設法改變第三國對中國抗戰的觀感。因爲英國最近對中國的抗戰已有比較積極的認識；她不但和美法一致，對日本破壞國際條的，强佔外人在華權益提出抗議，且貸欵中國，作經濟的援助，予日本的侵華運動以相當的打擊。所以她不得不揑造事實，淆惑視聽，以冀减少英國對中國的同情與援助。可是華北人民已深知她的奸計，除通電全國，揭露她的陰謀外，又在英大使抵津的時候，投函聲明矢忠擁護國民政府抗戰到底，絕無呼籲和平的謬想，以闢邪說，而正視聽。至於她利用「德義路綫」引誘抗日陣綫中的少數不明大義，不顧事實的動搖份子，來分化中國的團結，因而使抗戰無法繼續的陰謀，也是心勞日拙，毫無效果。因爲自在兆銘等叛國之後，主張走「德義路綫」的人，早已消聲匿跡，不敢露面了。</p>
<p>十九個月以來，中國民衆艱苦犧牲的結果，已使全國民衆都澈底了解要完成民族解放，祗有抗戰到底，才能達到目的。中國根本是被壓迫，被侵略的國家，此次抗戰，完全是爲了受不過壓迫侵略，才起而自衛，也就是爲了民族生存，民族解放，才忍痛下了大决心，而走入抗戰的一途。戰是自衛，不戰便是投降，便是屈服，便是自趨滅亡！現在中國勝利的前途，日見光明，爲山九仭，怎甘功虧一簣。願中華全體國民奮發堅苦卓絕的奮鬥精神，來粉碎日本的一切政治陰謀，黔驢之技已窮，且看她再玩什麼把戲？</p>

<p>增强陸軍</p>
<p>香港乃一海島、未來戰爭、陸軍所佔之地位當不重要、然老成持重之英國人、並不因此而忽視陸軍實力之擴充、目下香港陸軍數量、因事關軍事秘密、吾人無法探知、然視去年一年中之一再增防、可知其數已在不少、最近港政府復在香港之七姊妹游泳塲附近、新設大量木營房、並調來新軍四營、駐紮該處、此四營新軍、爲長期駐港之英國防軍、故目下香港駐紥英軍之總數、當在萬名以上、港當局復努力招募旅港英·印·華人之參加義勇軍、此項義勇軍、經一再召募之結果、現在總數已有數千名之多義勇軍之訓練編制、一如正式軍隊、並分步砲海軍三種、且一如正規睦軍之極力使之機械化、即以陸軍義勇軍一項而論、內分來福槍隊、機關槍隊、鐵甲車隊、及機械化隊至於正規陸軍之機械化程度、則更驚人、除原有摩托車隊·裝甲车隊·及機械化隊外、最近且將運到最新式之坦克事、使陸軍實力愈臻雄厚、與陸軍有密切關係之砲兵、在香港防禦上所佔地位、允爲重要、香港兩年來砲壘建造之堅强、固足驚人、而砲兵實力之充實、亦與日俱增、最近赤柱·西環附近一帶各大小砲台只均將砲位口徑換大、並加配自動測量器等各項重要設備、同時又增築多量秘密砲位及機關槍巢、而對華人砲兵義勇軍之招慕訓練、更在積極進行中、</p>
<p>充實海軍</p>
<p>香港海軍力量、亦極雄厚、長駐軍艦、以在三十艘以上、此項軍艦經常巡視演習於香港領海上、砲聲隆隆、一般人固已視爲常事矣、而除各項戰艦外、尙有航空母艦、魚雷艇等、最近各軍艦之出海演習、更形加緊、即素不演習之魚雷艇、數日來亦三三兩兩、縱橫於碧海之底、而港政府對於海軍義勇軍之招募·組織·及訓練、更屬不遺餘力、現在加入海軍義勇軍之中印人民、巳在二千以上、然海軍當局猶在繼續招募中、此項義勇軍之組織、計分掃雷隊·裝雷隊·巡查隊·檢騐隊·電訊隊·訊號隊·水手隊等、如一遇事變、即可全部動員、參加作戰、同時一星期前、又由英國運來封鎖艦一艘、此種封鎖艦專爲封鎖海口及啟封海口之用、艦身極大、上備各項封鎖材料及機械·活動異常便利、設若戰事爆發、該艦即可於數小時內、將海口堅固封鎖、使敵輪無法闖人、而如時勢轉穩、則又可於數小時內、將海口之之封鎖物全部取起、故此種新式封鎖利器、在遠東實屬創見也、</p>
<p>加緊空防</p>
<p>香港當局之注意空防、或較陸海方面為尤甚、關於空軍實力及防空力量、目前準備已相當週到、故近月來未聞有添加飛機、添築機塲或其他等事、惟時派飛機作投彈演習、而地下之高射砲、亦隨之作實彈演習、如本月九十兩日空軍當局指派轟炸機數架、携帶五百磅及二百五十磅炸彈多枚、至馬士灣·石牛灣一帶輪流轟炸、而地下之高射砲隊、則砰砰射擊、自晨迄暮、空襲之演出、固異常緊張也、他如警報機之裝置、刻下巳有十四具、尙有更新式完備之二十具、正由英國運來、下月即可抵港裝配、一俟裝配完畢、又將舉行大規模之夜襲演習矣、而關於防空方面之義勇隊，目下募集者已達八千名、現正繼續招募五千名、此一萬三千名防空義勇隊、將分二千個崗位指導居民之防空避彈、而其組織種類、則分爲警報·醫藥·救護·工程·消防·消毒·救護車司機·傳遞等類、至關於防空避彈之建築、刻下亦在積極進行中、計分三類、一爲由政府撥款建築規模極大之防空壕、一爲利用繁盛市街之大建築、闢室避彈、一爲獎勵私人於住宅花園中挖掘避彈壕、半年以前、香港當局對於避彈壕之建築、僅分二種、一即利用大建築、一在跑馬塲方面、試造屋頂平坦、漆以綠漆之避彈室數間、但鑒於中日戰爭中日本飛機之濫施轟炸、雖高大洋樓、亦不免洞穿到底、而露於地面之避彈室、亦僅足躱避炸彈之碎片、若一中彈、仍不免死傷遍地、故最近防空當局已放棄此種計劃、而圖建築極大規模之避彈壕於山洞之間、一面則盡力獎勵私人建築、同時並望各工程師於打樣建屋時、注意及此、而防毒方面、除向時加强防毒設備外、復擬向英國採購大量防審面具、分發居民應用、而其價値每只不過一元、香港當局之用心，可謂至矣盡矣、</p>

<p>— 凡</p>
<p>倫敦是世界金市塲的首都，又是國際金融的中心。這種優越地位，在平昔，固然造成了英鎊在世界貨幣市塲上的領袖資格。現在可變成踐踏英鎊的主要因素之一。因爲世界金價，旣因各國備戰的激漲，英鎊却被滙率拉住而不能跟起。這不營就變成英鎊對內價値的跌落。加以英國國庫，近年已由盈餘變成虧空；對外貿易和國際收支，又都發生逆差。英鎊對外價値，本身也軟弱得利害；怎再經得起金價漲風給他的這種壓迫？</p>
<p>現在英國財長西門，已向國會要求：實行重佔央蘭銀行的準備價値，並决定每週依市價佔定一次。由估價而發生的收益，用作外匯基金。至於該行的紙幣發行額，則要求由四萬萬鎊减至三萬萬鎊，並以此爲定數。不予增减。</p>
<p>這個辦法，在英國幣制上實是一次很大的革命。英格蘭銀行的準備金，向依法定價每盎斯八十五先令計算，且已有二百多年的歷史，從未變更。現在非特放棄這法定價，而且每過依市價估定一次。因此金價愈漲，也就是英國準備金或外滙基金的價値愈大。當然可使英鎊的地位，更堅固起來。倫敦泰晤士報稱此辦法爲「市價金本位」。勢將成爲現代貨幣學上的一個簇新的名詞。</p>
<p>再者：英格蘭銀行的紙幣發行額，向跟現金準備的多少而增减。如果依市價估定準備金額，在金價續漲的今日，紙幣發行勢必有增大可能。紙幣增大，金價當然會受通貨增加的影響而上昇。所以現在决定紙幣發行總額，不得超過三萬萬鎊。於是發行總額已成定數，而發行準備額，反因市價而視紙幣發行額爲轉移。與前適得其反。這眞是英鎊的新革命。</p>
<p>這次革命，對於今後的金價和鎊匯，將起什麽影響？以我們的見解，大致可使飛漲中的金價，和軟弱中的鎊滙，都得站穩一時。</p>
<p>因爲英格蘭銀行的紙幣發行現减至三萬萬，首先可得收縮通貨之利，使英鎊回堅，金價被束。又因重估而直接加强外滙基金，間接增强英國的財政信用，英鎊地位，自然可望提高。於是因懷疑英鎊而爭購黃金的人可以减少，那末金市的投機熱度，當然也可下减。因而倫敦的金市塲，其勢當可暫爲穩定一時了。</p>

<p>— （小禾）</p>
<p>最近兩旬來，國內外絲價，東也報漲，西也報漲，似乎絲業的黃金時代，是因了砲火的洗禮，而重見於今日。於是樂觀的空氣衝昏了頭腦，造成了數旬來外銷的「門可羅雀」，內銷的畸形在熱。在絲價方面表現出來的，是內外絲價相距百元，在銷路方面表現出來的，是生絲的出路投入囤購者的懷抱。結果，不僅使這調整國際貿易的主要出口品，失去了博取外滙的可能，更使戰後孤島上，慘淡經營的綢織廠，加重了原料成本的担負。這無疑是替絲業的本身，掘下了許多可以毀滅自己的陷阱。但是，究竟是爲了什麽原故，而使絲價這樣過度飛騰呢？這可從二方面來說。</p>
<p>第一方面，先來看看世界絲市的近况。</p>
<p>佔世界產絲百分之七十以上的日本，在其進行侵略戰爭的「國難」中，去年生絲的產量是减少了百分之十二·五，在展開第二期抗戰的今年，無疑的，它將在它國內，不論在任何部鬥中，必然地要顯現出更進一步枯萎和不景氣，這一點，是保證了今年度，世界絲市將受到原料缺乏的影響。</p>
<p>第二點。由於日本去年育蠶已經减少，致使存繭不能接住新繭產生，因而一部份日本絲廠，改做細條紋絲品藉以拖延時日，這一點造成了美國或日本本部的一三—一五條紋之生絲的過剩，二〇—二二條紋之生絲的不够供應。這在市塲上，使二〇—二二條紋之絲價超越了細條紋，促成了世界主要生絲市塲的絲價畸形發展。（按路透電生絲市價報吿上，近數旬來，二〇—二二條紋之絲價，每較一三—一五條紋之絲價高出一分至三分，即可證實此說。）</p>
<p>第三點，是，在日本採繭量减縮之下的優質乾繭之出口，及劣質乾繭之作爲羊毛代用品，以織製軍服等用。前者是由於德國絲廠的需要原料，及日本方面的要求換取德製侵略軍火。第二部份，即日本方面擬節省羊毛以節省行將枯竭之外滙。於是造成了雙重的原料荒，直接刺激了國際絲價的飛購。（未完）</p>

<p>紗市漲勢迂　前進、散戶無心辦擺過年貨、免得墊軟、市價稍好、照市出卸、惟本埠銀行界近來對於棉織品採辦未絕、且購現自運華南海防昆明等處銷售、比較有利可圖、人心益覺震盪、同時其他帮口雖無躉批發展之象、然零星交易亦較前幾日爲旺、市價因此轉入佳境、</p>

<p>原料被統制價飛漲</p>
<p>各紗廠之原料即棉花、素向江北及華北各產棉區採辦、今因以上各地先後淪陷、「華北臨時政府」與「華中維新政府」受日方之命、實施統制棉花之運銷、因此華商紗廠所需之原料、頗覺困難、去年各地產棉雖豐、但均爲日方統制、運至日本及關東租借地·朝鮮·台灣·等區、總値國幣的八千九百八十九萬七千七百十七元、棉價如去年十一月火機花平均五十二元八角九分、靈寳花平均八十四元零五分、天津美種花平均八十八元一角一分、以上三種棉花之價格、均爲民國二十一年以來之最高價</p>

<p>字林報云、據嘉興路捕房報吿、昨日（二日）午後四時至五時、上海北區、聞重砲聲頗淸晰、歷時半句鐘以上、衆信此乃揚子江中日艦、向兩岸華方游擊隊、開砲轟擊、故有砲聲傳來、</p>

<p>英國駐滬戰艦卡狄克號來滬多日、本埠英國聖台維斯會社委員等、爲該艦官佐聯歡起見、特於二日午假上海俱樂部舉行聚餐、作爲洗塵、惟該艦船主哈爾夫海特、以事並未參加、代以副船主亞立弗氏到席、由該會會員泊賴斯致歡迎詞、旋彼此互祝康健、按英艦卡狄克號、爲英國著名之有數戰鬥艦、曾於一九一八年指揮德國艦隊、聞參加歡筵之英僑中、並到有英國大使館漢姆氏、</p>

<p>各省政府暨海關、奉經濟財政兩部令、査禁資敵貨物桐油等五十四種後、浙省棉花土紙等各業、紛電要求放行、海關認爲上海係日人暴力控制之區、不允准土貨運往上海銷售、政府已撥款收買救濟、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>各業電請准許運滬</p>
<p>寗紹區棉花運銷處等、因棉花等貨物、被禁止運滬、以致棉農棉商生計斷絕、請求迅予飭浙海關、將甬埠存棉放行運滬、以救農商、爲防止資敵起見、可由華商紗廠聯合會、函具證明書、運滬後、再由財政部貿易委員會浙省物產調整處兩駐滬辦事處騐明、况上海租界、並非日人暴力控制之區、自不能指爲禁運區域、</p>
<p>浙江海關未便通融</p>
<p>浙江海關稅務司批示云，査上海地方、究竟應吾認爲禁運地點一節、本關殊屬無權考慮、至一月二十三日本關佈吿、禁運土貨出口、包括紙張在內、係由總稅務司轉奉財政部令飭到關、未便擅予修改、或不遵照施行、所請運往上海銷售一節、仰該處逕向財政部請求核辦可也、今土紙等業、均巳電財政經濟兩部、請求准予運滬、</p>
<p>上海暫定禁運區域</p>
<p>經濟部對於已被日人暴力控制之禁運區域、現已詳密調査、並與關係機關洽商、以憑指定、在未經經濟部指定以前、凡迫近戰區之地方主管官署、及各地海關、應就經確知已被日人暴力控制之地方、先行禁運、惟各地海關等、認爲上海係淪陷區域、故在經濟部未指定以前、一律禁止五十四種土貨運滬、現浙東等處土貨、均被阻運滬銷售、</p>
<p>阻滯各物政府收買</p>
<p>桐油等五十四種土貨、受禁運之後、如係當地產品大宗、因銷路阻滯、致影響人民生計者、經濟部已定補救辦法、令飭各省遵行、由各省府查其銷產情形、隨時咨部、或逕與財政部貿易委員會、及經濟部農本局等機關、洽商收買、以資救濟、今浙東之桐油、歸中央信託局收買、茶葉歸貿易委員會富華公司收買、</p>
<p>上海海關情形特殊</p>
<p>上海江海關、自稅收改存日商銀行、修改日貨稅率、並自去年六月起、停止解款於總稅務司、所以國府認爲如果內地土貨一旦運滬、一般貪圖小利之奸商、欲轉運出口，至各地、則我政府無法予以制止、</p>

<p>— 佛</p>
<p>前日有友人示余送常熟蔣子範先生一聯，十分有趣，蔣先生在二三十年前，余嘗碰見過幾次，其人亦確是有趣，故余認爲趣人趣事，成此趣文，遂寫了蔣先生一些歷史，裝了一個「鹹肉莊與小漢奸」題目，載在本刊，博讀者一笑。</p>
<p>昨接宋君平衡來書，並附「鹹肉莊與小漢奸正誤」一文，這文中對於蔣先生一生履歷，記載甚詳，知蔣先生今已七十二歲矣，余謂六十餘歲，誠屬舛誤，茲承明敎，深爲銘感，好在余之所記，並非爲蔣先生作生傳，茍大致不謬，即稍有舛誤遺漏，亦屬不妨。</p>
<p>惟來書所急欲糾正者，即就維持會會長一事，其實會員可爲，會長亦未始不可爲也。宋君來書有云，「中日戰起，蔣避亂蕩口，邑人沈九皋等，組織維持會，遣使招君及主慶芝，擬行矣，爲子所阻，王入城詭稱是蔣代表，允就維持會員，（並非會長）於是使者絡繹於道，一再强迫進城，難與抵抗，遂於去年陰曆十一月二十四日，含淚到會，任學務處主任，月餘謝去，羣小包圍之，不令離城，至今常在城中，度其憂鬱之生活。」</p>
<p>就這一段來書觀之，余不夠有幾點疑惑之處，總之宋君來函，不過爲蔣先生辯護一過「挨」字而已，但上面既說「擬行矣，爲子所阻，似本人確有欣然就道之意，不過因爲少老爺的不解事，打消老頭兒一片雅興。後面又說，「含淚到會」，此「淚」將從何而來？又說寫羣小包圍，不令離城」云云，現蔣先生既不爲維持會長，亦不爲維持會員，又不爲學務主任，則蔣先生係完全自由之身，羣小包圍目的何在？不過我聽說蔣先生又升了官了，現在余也不必云根究這些，因爲宋君既來函正誤，我也提出幾點疑問來請敎請敎罷了。來書後面又附蔣先生兩聯，嘲人兼以自嘲，至也有趣，錄之如後，或曰此非蔣先生手筆也</p>
<p>「赤手空拳，捧矮子卵泡，組織維持會。</p>
<p>提心吊膽，看晚爺面孔，奉承宣撫班。」</p>
<p>「有志則堅，自嘆不如長樂老。</p>
<p>豈我獨醉，誰知今爲未亡人。」</p>
<h3 id="c132">漫談漢奸 <a href="#c132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— 戈兒</p>
<p>抗戰爆發後，國人曾給「漢奸」下過一番「心理分析」。據說產生「漢奸」的原因有四：即（一），不深知亡國奴的痛苦，而拜金或失業者；（二）抱抗敵必敗論，而企圖先立僞功者；（三）食過皇祿，因此欲報皇恩者；（四）完全無智識，而拜金或失業者。</p>
<p>上術一·四·兩條產生「漢奸」的原因，我們可以向「拜金而失業者」加以說服的，而以現在，敵人的殘暴行爲，也早已證明了亡國奴是萬萬做不得的，英國名記者田伯烈氏（H.J.Timperley）的「外人目覩中之×軍暴行」，這是最好的一本「亡國奴痛苦記」的好書。當然，除了這，我們還得加以救濟失業者才行，否則，呌他們餓癟肚皮來奉行救國，這樣的「恥食周粟」的「伯夷叔齊」，在「無智識者」中怕是找不出來的，事實上，我們是也斷斷乎不能呌他們云學「伯夷叔齊」的樣。「伯夷叔齊」的，是應該以「豐衣足食」的「達官貴人」，去記熟的。</p>
<p>關於二·三·兩條這樣的「漢奸」，是「無可救藥」的我們就得要加以無情的鞭擊，如果可能的話；食其肉而寢其皮這樣的「處罰」他們，原也不爲過分。</p>
<p>食過皇祿而因此報其皇恩者，這早已是不足爲人道者了，這是已經奴隸成了性，這是一切的「家狗」的本色，這是「人類」的「頭銜」加諸於他們的恥辱。這樣的「東西」，如果容忍他們存留在世界上，實在是遺毒匪淺，不消除之，人類的前途實在是不堪設想了！</p>
<p>然而更爲可毒的，是「春風轉舵」的那些自以爲是「識時務者」的「俊傑」了，一見敵人的「三斧頭」的蠻勁，認爲他們是必勝無疑，而自己方面是必敗的了，因此爲欲先立僞功，就美其名曰「我不入地獄誰入地獄」，就赫然去就「委員」或是「市長」之類的「職位」了，當然，也有些「聰明人」是抱著「三不主義」的，看來是既不欲立「僞功」，而儼然像是一本正經的「救世者」了，不過這種人是更僞可毒，所謂「洞里赤練蛇」者，就是指的這些老謀深算的陰險家，然而這卻不在我的話內。</p>
<p>卻說看風駛舵的抱「中國必敗論」而先立僞功榮任上海「市長」的傅筱庵，最近卻「頗萌悔意」了，原因是「中國最後用利之期，確已不遠」，因此懊喪萬分，認爲「六個月後，恐不能再在上海立足。」他的這種所謂「頗萌悔意，」與其當作他的「悔恨」看，不如說，中國的持久抗戰，只有使這種投機取巧者的消滅，在將來新中國的建成上說來，實在是非常的有益。</p>
<p>抗戰實在是太偉大了。呀！</p>
<h3 id="c133">海角游魂 <a href="#c133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— 思華</p>
<p>“Alglers”</p>
<p>聯美公司出品　大上海戲院映</p>
<p>看完「海底游魂」，對導演者的精湛的藝術手腕，不得不表示很大的欣佩。他的把握氣雰，情感，運用織接，使全片一氣呵成，緊緊地，不讓觀衆換一口氣；劇終時，又給觀衆心膜上烙下了感慨的印象。</p>
<p>第一，氣雰處理的濃厚：（甲）以北美洲特有的音樂，和利亞地方的特殊建築，充分地表現了那里的地方色彩。（乙）警捕到加西巴區中，遭到四面的襲擊，顯出那區里面的情形複雜，探捕是難以置身其中的。同時由於毛戈的逃避探捕，介紹出毛戈騙局中扇子構遷的複雜。（丙）暗探勒傑士被毛戈誘入室內，坐下，鏡頭劃過二邊門戶，毛戈的伙伴很安詳的走出，二個坐門邊，二個坐在勒傑士身後。於是勒傑士由不安，漸漸地哆嗦，額角上流著大汗，急得發昏……鬥牌，勒傑士不知應鬥什麽牌？由毛戈伙伴在旁指示……比阿洛受傷回來，持槍欲擊勒傑士，勒狂呼，音樂聲大作，掩倒呼聲，勒死。</p>
<p>第二，織接的活潑：（甲）警捕在探捕於加西巴區時，毛戈等先按著不動。待警捕等出來，毛戈等伙伴四散各處，導演者以極短的膠片，極明快的手法，寫上下左右都在發槍襲擊，遠遠的，望到探捕慌亂情形。（乙）毛戈準備與紺琵歡敘之前，得意忘形，邊擦皮鞋邊唱，歌聲在空間盪漾著，短促畫面描寫士人們隨著歌聲舞動。（丙）毛戈與紺琵相對而坐。Cut以後，愛妮絲在另室拉開窗門，透過窗簾，敘寫出毛戈與紺琵在對面含情脈脈狀態。</p>
<p>第三，抒情的細膩：（甲）愛妮絲對毛戈的深戀，導演者累次寫她定視著毛戈。毛戈幾次出區外，她都妬忌的地捆住著。（乙）毛戈與紺琵的第一次見面，導演者道德以開麥拉眼代表毛戈的眼，特寫著她胸前瞻和臂上的珠項圈和珠鐲。過一面，他們默默地，以視綫釘著視綫。表示毛戈已由覬覦她的珠器進而被她美色所吸引了。（丙）毛戈候不到紺琵的二次情形都不同，第一次甚至跟伙伴吵嘴，第二次毅然比離區往城市。</p>
<p>第四，不放鬆細微之處：（甲）毛戈到處，二個伙伴必安祥地隨之而出。（乙）寫過毛戈擦皮鞋之後，導演曾在二次特寫他的皮鞋，觀衆也一望而知爲毛戈。</p>
<p>第五，使人唏噓的結局：毛戈上船，探窗望室內，紺琵背外而坐，他一時看不見，直至他視綫往下望，大家以爲他可以看見她時，鏡頭換到他背後，三個暗探已經挾住他了。上銬，下船，他要求停留片刻，船起椗時，他見紺琵上船頂，他情感衝動而呼，汽笛聲，紺琵掩耳，他狂奔狂呼，探開槍，毛戈倒地斃命。所以給觀衆唏噓之感，是因爲毛戈在加西巴區，是像英雄一般的，其次是毛和紺的未能會面。</p>
<p>除了導演的精湛手腕之外，值得稱頌的是卻爾斷斯鮑盲的毛戈，他沉著，英俊，又有氣魄。其次是雪格麗戈的愛妮絲，她的眼眸中，始終燃燒著愛與妬忌之火，而海蒂拉瑪的嫵媚，以及靜靜的愛之表演，也是很優秀的。</p>
<p>不過，劇本並沒有多大的意義，它祗是一個羅曼絲，一個三角戀愛的悲劇；但因爲以騙局爲背景，所以看起來也就覺得新穎可愛了。</p>
<h3 id="c134">猶太難民雜記 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— 柯震</p>
<p>住在德國的猶太人，多數都是有幾個錢的，現在遭了希特拉的排斥，借著澄清血統的美名，把他們的財產沒收，逼著他們離境，作飄流無依的難民。</p>
<p>上海審美觀點他們視爲謀生唯一的新土，所以一批一批的難民都相繼地來臨。他們的臨時膳食處是在四川路青年會，作者朝夕很多機會與他們會面，所以茲把所觀到的一些介紹給各位知道。</p>
<p>這許多難民的衣服都很整齊，有許多所穿的質料裁剪都很考究，所以一望而知他們從前的家境是很好的。據他們自己說，中間有許多都曾爲德國的小富翁，擁有相當的資產呢</p>
<p>他們的年紀大多在二十至四十左右，很少老年的和幼年的。男的較女的我，小孩佔極少數。據作者個人觀察，單身的男子是佔最多數，而壯年的男子尤多。</p>
<p>每天所吃的西餐很簡單：二塊粗麵包，（奶油沒有），一湯，一菜而已。這與他們從前在家內吃的比起來是差得很遠了，代他們想像起來是不禁感嘆無已。可是，若與我國的難民比較起來，則他們要算幸福得多了。按他們每人每餐所費共需國幣四角，而我國難民一天所需亦祗國幣一角而已。他們還可說是高等難民。</p>
<p>他們到滬的時候，行李很簡單，祗有隨身的皮篋。據說：每人離境祗准攜帶這些，其餘的東西一概不准攜走，並且現幣也不准多帶，祗准沿途所需的一些。希特特居心於斯可見。</p>
<p>初到滬時，他們的面色都很沉著，講話不多，顯露著他們內心的愴痛是多麽的難受，無祖國的痛苦的確是痛苦呀！</p>
<p>現在一部份的難民已找得了相當的職位，所以比較初來時，他們終算安定得多了。有幾個年紀較輕的已謀得職位的竟也組織了乒乓隊籃球隊等想和滬地的球隊週旋一下。據聞，二月四日他們的乒乓隊將與青年會少年部的乒乓隊舉行比賽，屆時的情形當很爲別緻，預期慕名作壁上觀的人必屬很多。而且據說：這次的比賽也是他們自己向少年部約訂的，因爲他們的一部份愛好乒乓者看銅陵我國少年們拍打乒乓，不禁手癢難熬，躍躍欲試。</p>
<p>現在，大概再有一二星期之久，他們便將都有了安插之所，不致再每日二次風雨無阻地奔到青年會來果腹了。</p>

<p>第三回　仰遺容追思老義士　開文盲問字小先生</p>
<p>只聽得那小學生說道：『公公！我再講一節你聽吧。聽了這一節，你上面的那一節，也可以明白了。』那老頭了卻把小孩子的頭，摸了一摸，便道：『好孩子！你講的很明白。這裏頭，有幾個字，你公公不識，大概是一種新字嗎』？小學生道：『是的！現在我們中國，造了許多新字，卻是關於科學上的。我在學校裏，先生曾經給了我一張表，我回去尋出來，給公公好了』。老頭子道：『好的！那末我有一封白兔子，耳朶很長，眼睛很紅，我知道你喜歡的，我也送給你』。那孩子聽了，快活得跳了起來，抱著老頭兒的頭，只是不放。何家兩位小姐看得有點癡了，因想：這眞有些奇妙。瞧他兩人，一老一小，一定是一個祖父，一個孫兒。只有祖父去課孫兒讀書，現在倒是孫兒去敎導他的公公起來。說什麽，講了這一節，你就可明白了。而那位老者，卻反請敎於黃口小兒，又說：「你公公有幾個字不識，」眞是奇聞哪。正詫異間，恰巧金澹雲與林建成兩人，也走過來了。那老頭子卻認得金澹雲的，便向她招呼道：『金小姐今天怎麼有工夫，到此游玩呢』？金澹雲笑道：『黃老爹！你今天又要你的令孫，給你講書了嗎』？那老頭兒聽了，好像有些忸怩之色，便道：『見笑！見笑』！便和他的孫子說道：『還不和金小姐行個禮，前兒她還給你獎品咧』。那孩子果然站起來，向金澹雲鞠了一個躬。又告訴他道『公公說明天給我一對白兔子，耳朶很長，眼睛很紅的。』金小姐道：『你公公不但有兔子，還有別的好玩的東西呢』。說著，他們便離開這裏。何儷玉道：『澹雲姊認得這老頭兒嗎？我剛纔覺得很奇怪，怎麼一個老頭兒，反問字於小孩子，原來他們是個祖孫嗎』？金澹雲道：『這一點就可見吾們中國從前失學者的多，到如今追悔無及了。實不相瞞，這老頭兒從前在吾家做過園丁，他的名字呌阿毛。那時我還年小，他曾經抱了我上幼穉園咧。人是一個好人，可是一字不識。當初他們的意思，以爲當一個園丁，要識什麽字。到了後來，纔知道不識字的人，有種種的吃虧呀』！（三〇）</p>

<h3 id="c136">論生之價値 <a href="#c136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— 英夫</p>
<p>人們旣生於世上，便都有生的要求，這便是說：「我要活，我要好好地活在世上。」所以無論貧富，想活是個個人所希求的；即使貧到做了乞丐，他也不願意自殘共生，說是一我不想活了。」</p>
<p>但生之價値，是吾眞在於求生活的安樂而已，就是說：「我只耍有衣穿，有飯吃，有屋住，有路行便得了。」那當然是不對的。因爲人們除了衣食住行以外，主要的還在於做一番事業。衣食住行固是維持我們日常生活的必需條件，但做事業更是我們生之所以爲生的唯一主旨。如果只會衣食住行，可以不顧事業，那又何異於禽獸，蠕蠕蠢蠢，但求一飽？而社會怎麽會有進步的日子呢？</p>
<p>所以嚴格的說起來，求生的目的，應在事業而不在生活，生之所以有價値，也就在於此。如果但求生活，而不顧事業，則他在社曾上既無所謂貢獻，在他自己也便無生之價値。所謂生旣無益於世，死亦無害於世也。所謂國家的蝨賊，所謂社會的蠧蟲，也正是這一種人們，因爲他不但無益於世，有時因他們存在，反而會有害於世。</p>
<p>我們正可以說，一個大有爲的人物，必定只顧他的事業如何去成就牠，而不顧他的生活如何去享受的。舉幾個簡單的例來說罷，文天祥當奉詔，勤王的時候，即盡以家貲爲軍費：史可法當督師淮揚的時候，行不張蓋，食不重味。他們爲什麼不自求生活的安樂，而願自苦如此呢？正因爲自己的生活儘可刻苦，而事業却不能不幹。只有奸臣像賈似道，還要在國已將亡的時候，大興土木，擁寵姬，鬥蟋蟀；像馬士英，賣官鬻爵，以圖自飽，而諸鎮軍餉，可以靳而不發。此其觀念只在於生活的安樂，何嘗想到他所負責任的事業呢！</p>
<p>所以但求生活安樂的，决不是幹大事業的人物。只求生活的安樂，也决不是生之眞正的目的。孔子說：「無求生以害仁，有殺身以成仁。」孟子說：「生亦我所願也，義亦我所欲也，二者不可得兼，舍生而取義者也。」可知人們於求生以外，正尙有成仁取義的必要。所謂成仁取義，也就是我所說的大事業。幹大事業的，於社會能得其福利，於自己才能得其生的眞價値。</p>
<p>生的眞價値旣然在此，那末我們還應當瑣瑣求個人生活的安樂嗎？今世不乏有那出賣靈魂，只求苟安者，而美其名曰：「我要求生，所以如此。」似乎生之意義只在於此，求生的目的亦只在於此。這種言行，眞是失之毫厘，差以千里了。</p>
<h3 id="c137">圍剿 <a href="#c137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— 金戈</p>
<p>塘裏泊着千百艘小漁船，密密層層，遠遠望過去，像魚鱗一般。外邊海口也泊有百來艘大漁船，那些帆檣，像一片美麗豐茂的竹林。</p>
<p>太陽爬出海面，掀起洶湧的巨浪，向塘裏打來，千餘艘漁船不停地晃盪若，驚動了那批年靑結實的漁民。他們一骨碌地跳起身，抹了抹眼睛，收起錨繩，快活地唱着：「……祖宗留下的基業，靠它過夏也過冬。黃花魚，勝黃金；長帶魚，比玉環……那怕强盜多，我們齊心不怕他兇。我們是勇敢的漁民！……」」他們那樣哼着，便開始他們底工作。</p>
<p>前面先走的大漁船，長長的一列，眞像一長串帶魚。雄壯的歌聲，充滿了整個的海。在海風裏，帶來了遠處的空虛的回聲。</p>
<p>出了海口，船隻四面分散，各自去網魚，拋下了大漁網，靜悄悄地。</p>
<p>海而非常平靜，像睡去了一般。</p>
<p>在海的一角，突然出現一艘懸有膏藥旗的小兵船，逕向大漁船這邊駛來。</p>
<p>「啊！强盜來了！咱們等死嗎？……不！不！先下手爲强，小三，你吹號，讓他們同來相帮：海根，你們準備砲，快！快！」船老大興奮地呌着，自已也跑到土砲邊，帮着上火藥。</p>
<p>「的大……的的大……」號角響了。</p>
<p>「蓬！」老大親自放了第一砲。砲彈飛過去，打在鬼子船的頭部，船頭略略向前震了一震。</p>
<p>「蓬！」强盜船也回了一砲，砲彈飛過來，離開一隻漁船沒有多遠，激起了幾丈高的浪花。</p>
<p>「咯咯咯……」强盜船放機關槍了。</p>
<p>「夥計！放槍呀！快快！呆什麽呀！糟糕！放槍，放槍呀！快！快！」老大拉直了喉嚨，大聲地呼喊。自己從身旁的一個夥計手中，奪過來一把土砲，瞄準就放。</p>
<p>「蓬…蓬蓬……」强盜的砲及土砲。</p>
<p>「咯…咯咯……」機關槍。</p>
<p>「拍！劈拍！…劈劈拍……！」土槍。</p>
<p>不久，另外許多大漁船，循着號音駛來了。他們發覺了這裏的危急，便立刻束一艘，西一艘地都向那强盜船包圍過來，像許多餓透了的魚兒，競爭着一塊大麵包。</p>
<p>「蓬！蓬！……」砲彈像雨點般地飛向强盜船，它受着猛烈的攻擊，開始有些傾斜了。</p>
<p>「呀！」一顆子彈，打中了老大底高舉着的手臂，殷紅的血在衣袖裏冒着，他不由地喊了一聲。</p>
<p>「怎麽啦？老大！你！你！」夥計們都圍了過來。</p>
<p>「瘋了嗎？別管我！放砲！放槍！快放！快！快…」老大突出了眼珠子，咬緊牙齒。</p>
<p>「蓬！蓬蓬！……拍！劈拍！劈！……」</p>
<p>强盜船受不住了，尾部先沒到水裏，接着中部……，最末是頭部，濃烈的白烟，冒在水面上，逐漸散開，最後，強盜船旗杆上的膏藥旗，也一同消滅在水裏了。</p>
<p>「蓬…蓬蓬蓬！」向强盜船沉沒的水面，放了最後幾下送葬的禮砲。</p>
<p>老大舉起血淋淋的手臂，大家都興奮地和着唱道；「……那怕强盜多，我們齊心不怕他兇！我們是勇敢的漁民！……」</p>
<p>受傷者底臉上映着榮譽的光輝，早忘却了創痛。他們終於把侵略的强盜殲滅，報了梅天大仇！</p>

<p>— 天餘</p>
<p>這幾天偶然翻閱宇文懋昭的大金國志看到大金國主的冊立張邦昌文一篇，冊立劉豫文一篇。我把這兩篇文章細讀之下，深深地佩服大金國主的聰明。他的親善的口吻，眞和今人逼肖；他的一想情願的計割，也和今人相仿。這眞是當今的　鑑，所以我借用「冊府元龜」四個字做標題，把牠們節錄如下，以供衆賞：</p>
<p>（一）冊立張邦昌文</p>
<p>「……粵惟有宋，實乃通鄰……天厭其德，民不聊生；而又姑務責人，罔知省己……以故徵師命將，伐罪弔民……今者國旣乏主，民宜混同，然念厥初，誠非貪土，遂命帥府，與衆推賢……」</p>
<p>（二）冊立劉豫文</p>
<p>「……無幷爾疆，以示不貪之德；止遷其主，用彰伐罪之心……咨爾劉豫……居於亂邦，生不遇世。百里雖智，亦奚袖於虞亡；三仁至高，或願從於周仕……付爾封疆，並從舊楚。更須安集，自適攸居。爾共上體天心，下從民欲，忠以藩王室，信以保邦圻……」</p>
<p>我們瞧！第一篇裏什麽「，伐罪弔民」「誠非貪土」，說得多麽冠冕堂皇。第二篇開首重申「誠非貪土」；中間一段贊揚劉豫的話，盡量把漢奸的身份抬高，呌漢奸們怎不感激涕零；末段指示出漢好的任務，在於建立新秩序，做大金國的奴隸。這兩篇文章做得條理不紊，涵義深長。我覺得大金國主可以算是「以華制華」的發明者了！</p>

<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>『因爲他午後就要到前方去指揮軍事，恐怕坐席坐得太久了，躭擱了他，所以特地同他早來的。』</p>
<p>鎭長畢竟機靈，他聽葉老先生這樣一說，連忙離座到後面去，呌手下人出來擺席。不一時，席面擺設好了，大家少不得又互相推讓了一會，結果是由葉老先生和葉團長坐了上席，其他的陪客也都按着各人的身分和地位挨决坐了下來。陳鎭長見大家都已坐定，便執着酒壺，站起身來說：</p>
<p>『今天我們大家在這裏歡迎葉團長，我們合浦鎭上出了葉團長這樣一個人物，不僅是葉老先生個人門第的光榮，也是我們全鎭的光榮！我現在謹代全鎭的人公敬葉團長一杯，祝葉團長健康，早日戰勝×寇。』</p>
<p>說着，便笑嘻嘻的來代葉團長斟酒。誰知葉團長却謝絕了，他只是拱手，笑着說：『不能喝。』任憑陳鎭長和陪客們怎樣苦勸都不中用。陳鎭長不由得放下酒壺，向葉團長道：</p>
<p>『那麽，就請用半杯罷。』</p>
<p>葉團長却不過情，只好勉强領了半杯，陳鎭長又代葉老先生和其他陪客們斟過酒，安了席，於是談話便開始了，大家都爭着向葉團長詢問前綫的情形。葉團長不慌不忙的把象牙筷在席上畫着說；</p>
<p>『敵人這次在金山衛登陸，是有漢奸領導的，牠的用意很明顯的是在包抄上海的後路。不過這還不是牠的全部目的，牠一定還耍分兵直撲嘉興，企圖佔領這總綰滬杭蘇嘉兩條鐵路的重要據點，要是嘉興給牠攻陷，那牠就可以南攻杭州，北襲蘇州後路了。』</p>
<p>聽到了「嘉興」這地名，席上的人不由得都爲之一震，因爲這地方離開這里並不遠，名稱也是大家所習聞的，鎮上大部份日用品的供給，以及農作物生產品的出路，也都靠着嘉興。尤其是蔡和豐，他的木材生意，全靠滬杭蘇嘉兩路沿綫一帶，所以他比別人分外着急，忍不住念急的問道：</p>
<p>『照葉團長看來，×軍可能攻陷嘉興嗎？』</p>
<p>『這是軍機，恕我不能洩漏。』團長微笑的做着手勢說：『不過我的任務是在防守蘇嘉鐵路南段，我一定耍竭力阻住敵人，不讓牠們過來。』</p>
<p>這話使大家稍微安心了一些，陳鎭長不禁沒口子的稱讚着說：</p>
<p>『葉團長不但是國家的楝樑，而且也是家鄕的保障……』</p>
<p>他的話被廚子送上來的一盆熱炒打斷了，因爲幾位會獻慇懃的陪客已經舉起杯子來，他只好也把杯子照了一照，却並不喝酒，連忙舉起筷子，做着邀請的姿勢，向葉團長說：</p>
<p>『請趁熱用！這是鎭上有名的復興園辦的菜，滋味還算不錯。』</p>
<p>葉老先生正在蒲蘆蒲蘆的抽水烟，聽陳鎮長這樣說，便和他談起菜來。別的陪客們則仍在和葉團長談着戰事形勢。楊岳梁問，要是戰事接近過來，合浦鎮的前途有沒有危險？葉團畏說</p>
<p>『這里沒有鐵路公路錢，交通不便，在戰事初接近過來時，是不要緊的，不過以後怎樣，却很難說。」（四）</p>

<h3 id="c142">吳佩孚氏談游藝 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 萸</p>
<p>實實在在的，論人眞不宜過早啊。</p>
<p>例　如某方對吳佩孚氏造出許多謠言，報章騰載，令人不可捉摸。然而現在呢？一切都給事實來推翻了，吳佩孚不僅未曾就任什麽僞政府的總統，而且他在堅决拒絕之後，發表談話，表示他愛國的精神。</p>
<p>吳氏有這樣的高風亮節，浩然正氣，完全是由於歷史的影響。他崇拜岳飛，他更頌揚關羽，大的言志行事，雖然完全以關岳爲模範；則小小關節之處，也似乎非根據關岳所言所行的而言而行，是不足安慰自己的。</p>
<p>他曾說：「孔老夫子的六藝，就是「禮」「樂」「射「御」「書」「數」這六類呀，他老人家雖然提倡遊藝，但是他的意思是在遊藝中也滲進敎育的作用的。我很歡喜學習六藝，我對於遊藝的主張是在不使亂性，就也是古人說的陶冶性情呵。可是今人，允其是那般生長於大都會裹的後生小子們，他們懂得什麼呌做六藝嗎？他們的「禮」，是跳交際舞；抱了女人接吻；見了人握握手，打一聲哈囉；他們的「樂」，是「舞伴之歌」；是「妹妹我愛你」；是「桃花江」；是舞塲裏的爵士樂；總之，世界是變了，後生小子們的前途，眞是可怕。」</p>
<p>幾年來，吳氏蟄居北平，無聊的時候，總是找一個知已來，着着象棋，或着着圍棋，靜心對奕，往往消磨了整個下午。有時候，也提高嗓子，唱上一齣「武家坡，」或「坐宮，」或，駡曹，」可是因爲年齡的關係，氣韻未免不够，遇到不能拉長尾音時，便埋怨自己。「到底老了，不中用了。」接着就是一陣子呵呵大笑。</p>
<p>晚陲前，打一通五關，卜卜吉凶。淸早起來，打一套小拳之後，休息片刻，則入書室。非作詩，即繪畫，或是熟讀「春秋，」使自己能與「春秋」哀的言行同化。</p>
<h3 id="c143">關於「木蘭從軍」 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>在這個充滿着陰陽怪氣的孤島上，一切都似乎有一點反常，允其是遊藝事業，神怪的，淫穢的，隨流逐波，愈演愈烈，旣談不到意識正確，同時也且出賣了自身所應負的使命，老是鑽向牛角尖裏去，那該是何等痛心的事！最近華南影星陳雲裳女士膺聘來滬，攝製古裝劇「木蘭從軍」，現正從事拍攝，將於廢歷新年獻映，我們希望攝製者別太注重生意眼，而重蹈此覆轍！</p>
<p>「木蘭從軍」，故事的內容非常單調，可是意識上比較健全，倘使穿插得有致，也未始不是一個足以激厲民氣的精警劇本。過去，現在蜚聲於航空界的李霞卿女士，也會主演過「木蘭從軍」，可是攝製者爲了要過於保持歷史而忽略了現實，甚至竟流於神秘的泥古不化之途，使觀衆但覺其古色古香，結果是失敗的。因此，對於此次「木蘭從軍」的攝製，至少不能忽視了這一點。</p>
<p>其次，花木蘭以一個弱女子而代父從軍，那是何等悽慘的事，因此，我們不必以爲花木蘭一定是一身子矯捷行俠仗義的女英雄，而能馳騁沙塲，殺敵致果，她是由於敵人的壓迫而且更激於義憤，才不得不毅然决然代父入伍，拋棄了粉盒脂鈿，停機罷綉，居然易欽而弁，「旦辭黃河去，暮至黑水頭」，從事於槍林彈雨，烟硝火氛的戰塲生活，在這裏，我們儘管可以暴露着戰爭的罪惡，亦足够抓住觀衆的同情。</p>
<p>木蘭辭末段有「雄兔脚撲朔，雌兔眼迷離，兩兔傍地走，安能辨我是雌雄？」這幾句語意的描寫，不啻正象徵了今年太歲屬兔，令人有不管男女俱有慷慨從戎之責，而况據說陳雲裳女士雖富於東方古典美，可是却掩飾不了她那剛健的姿態，確允其是難能可貴的，我們希望陳女士在此劇中，不但能保持過去光榮，而且希望她有更光榮的貢獻，來一掃妖氛，一新耳目。</p>

<p>旣然買到鐘點，開始播音，那就要規定鐘點，不論風雨交加，大雪紛飛，必須趕到電台，幹那機械化的工作，好比唱戲的登台一般，不能誤塲；遲到了，無情的報吿員就要報吿出去，「□□□還沒有來，請聽唱片」。有時碰到傷風咳嗽和喉痛，那簡直是要性命了，眞是啞子吃黃蓮，說不出的苦，托人代庖吧，往往所播的商店會給他永遠地代了去，所以播音員一旦發生了疾病，除非呌自己的學生代理之外，情願要求電合開唱片，是不情願托人代庖的。有幾家電台是在旅館中的五層樓上，設或碰着要緊事情，躭誤鐘點，急急忙忙的跑到電台去，可巧會碰到電梯出毛病，那可要命了，氣急忽忽的跑上五層樓，上氣不接下氣，對着話筒會說不出話來，無情的聽衆，又在那裏打電話來責問了：「□□□還沒有來嗎一？唉！凡事皆因吃飯難，落在其中，吃一行，怨一行，但是誰呌你鑽進播音圈裏去的？</p>
<p>播音第一要口齒淸晰，腦筋靈敏，電台是有規則的，對於有關政治及有礙風化的句語，是絕對禁止的，所以處處要留神，一不小心，就會弄出毛病來，而且所播的唱句，必須常翻花樣，如果唱來唱去，總是這些老調，就要說你炒冷飯，沒有貨色，自己會動腦筋會執筆的，編幾齣新花樣，常然便宜不少，可是不會動筆的於是要出錢去托人代編，何况又得不到好貨，眞是苦不堪言。</p>

<p>上面這段詞，的確不大容易唱。我還聽過一位河南的老票友劉孝先君唱過「連環套」的流水板，內有「適才螻兵報一信，他報道，北京城，鋪黃土，掛紅燈，家家戶戶結綵紅。某問他掛燈因何故？他言道奉旨興圍射獵的梁九公，聖上賜他一匹馬走龍，將身且坐聚義廳，再與衆位說分明。」此外劉君唱過「王翦探營」的反二簧，可惜我只記得一句倒板「在軍中傳一令如同雷吼，」沒有向劉君把全詞抄下，很是件憾事。前天江子誠先生還問我，花臉唱大段反二簧，是吾眞有其事？我說這是我二十年前親耳聽見過的，還有甚麼假的呢？可見現今伶界人材太缺，又都不肯虛心求敎，以致有許多好腔好詞全都失傳，實在太覺可惜。我家裏還保存有金秀山的「烏盆計」「刺王僚」「法門寺」「牧虎關一等唱片，這都是數十年前老謀得利公司灌的，現在外邊買不到了。金少山每到我家裏來總要要求開聽一兩次，我同他說：論我倆的交情，我很想把你老爺子的幾張片子送給了你，一來你可以時聞你父親的遺音，好努力上進；二來也可以拿他當個模範，增益你的劇藝。無如我向來的宗旨是專意在保存國粹，凡是國家的文化劇藝，同伶界的老唱片，老照片，及名伶的遺物等，我全搜羅了來，預備將來陳列在「國家戲劇陳列館，」供全國人的硯聽，因此就不能移贈與你了。不過我所特別允許你的，就是只要你來，我準可破例開給你聽；因爲一張片子至多可以開聽百次，所以我平素非對知音，也决不肯隨便把許多老唱片開給人家聽呢。</p>

Ye also stated that the procedures established at the Kuomintang Provisional Congress held in Hankou last May will continue to be implemented.

Ye declined to comment on the personnel and organization of the newly established Supreme National Defense Council, stating that its contents would be determined by the Standing Committee of the Central Executive Committee to be convened soon.

<h3 id="e7">Japan's Political Conspiracy <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Because Japan's invasion of China has encountered difficulties in military progress, it has had no choice but to use political conspiracies to instigate peace, attempting to divide China's anti-Japanese front and weaken its resistance strength, so as to end the war under conditions of victory. This would not only digest the interests already gained, but also dismantle China's unity, causing China to return to the state of pre-war strife, thus taking the opportunity to engage in further aggression. Although this conspiracy has been repeatedly shattered by China's strong anti-Japanese front, it has not only not disappeared to this day, but has become increasingly intense in direct proportion to the increasing difficulty of Japan's military progress.</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance entered its second stage, Japan's military progress in China has not only made no progress, but has become increasingly mired in difficulties. To attack the Northwest, it suffered one defeat in western Shanxi and another in southern Shanxi, and its attempts to cross the river became a complete bubble. To open up the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, it was thwarted in the northern border of Hunan and Hubei, and hindered in Huaxian and Xinjie in the south. To attack the Southwest, it cannot cross Beihai and Sanshui. In the various guerrilla areas, the Chinese guerrilla forces are extremely active, launching attacks anytime, anywhere, resulting in exhaustion in responding, and being in a dilemma of advancing and retreating. Not only that, since the launch of the war, its domestic finances have fallen into a state of utter exhaustion, with currency inflation, rising prices, and people struggling to survive, and anti-war sentiment is rising. Many university professors have been arrested for opposing the war, and left-wing parties have launched large-scale anti-war movements. These facts have made the Japanese rulers also keenly aware of the disadvantages of long-term warfare against China, and therefore used the conspiracy to instigate peace as a way to seek survival from death. On the one hand, taking advantage of the British ambassador's inspection of northern China, it issued a telegram in the name of civil organizations and prominent figures in northern China, calling for peace. On the other hand, it used the "German-Italian Axis" to send Matsuda, a member of the House of Peers, and Kurihara, a member of the House of Representatives, to China to lobby the Italian ambassador to China, asking him to mediate the Sino-Japanese War. At this time, Germany, eager for Japan to achieve victory in China, spread rumors in Chongqing about "German-Soviet friendship" and that the "Anti-Comintern Pact" would become a waste of paper, in an attempt to sow discord between China and the Soviet Union and relax China's resistance efforts.</p>
<p>The reason why Japan wants to take advantage of the British ambassador's inspection of northern China, and falsely use names to issue telegrams calling for peace, is not only to divide China's anti-Japanese front, but also to try to change the perception of third countries about China's resistance. Because Britain has recently had a more active understanding of China's resistance; it not only united with the United States and France to protest against Japan's destruction of international treaties and forcible occupation of foreign interests in China, but also lent money to China to provide economic assistance, giving Japan's invasion of China a considerable blow. Therefore, it has no choice but to fabricate facts and confuse the public, in order to reduce British sympathy and assistance to China. However, the people of northern China already deeply understand its treacherous plan. In addition to telegraphing the whole country to expose its conspiracy, they also sent a letter when the British ambassador arrived in Tianjin, declaring their loyalty to the National Government and their determination to resist Japan to the end, with no false idea of calling for peace, in order to dispel the false rumors and correct the record. As for its conspiracy to use the "German-Italian route" to lure a few unstable elements in the anti-Japanese front who do not understand the overall situation and disregard the facts, in order to divide China's unity, and thus make it impossible for the resistance to continue, it is also a futile effort with no effect. Because since Wang Jingwei and others betrayed the country, those who advocated taking the "German-Italian route" have long since disappeared and dared not show their faces.</p>
<p>For nineteen months, the result of the Chinese people's arduous sacrifices has made the whole country thoroughly understand that in order to complete national liberation, only resistance to the end can achieve the goal. China is fundamentally a country that has been oppressed and invaded. This resistance is entirely because it cannot bear the oppression and invasion, and only then has it risen up in self-defense, that is, for the sake of national survival and national liberation, it has painfully made a great determination and embarked on the path of resistance. War is self-defense, and not fighting is surrender, is submission, is self-destruction! Now the prospects for China's victory are becoming increasingly bright. Why give up halfway to achieving the summit after climbing nine mountains? May all the Chinese people promote the spirit of hard work and perseverance to crush all of Japan's political conspiracies. The donkey's trick is exhausted, let's see what tricks it will play next?</p>
<h3 id="e8">Sino-British Continued Negotiations; Loan of Four to Five Million Pounds; Contract for Three Hundred Trucks to Be Signed Immediately; The United States Is Also Considering Consolidating the Chinese Currency System <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(London) Reuters exploration: The Sino-Government Procurement Committee is about to sign a contract with the British side to purchase three hundred three-ton and seven-ton trucks for use on the Burma Road. The funds will be allocated from the British credit loan of 500,000 pounds to China. According to previous reports, the Burma Road has unsound engineering, and trucks cannot be heavier than three tons. However, the road construction is gradually improving, so this batch of seven-ton trucks should be able to travel smoothly when they arrive in the future. It is also heard that preliminary negotiations are about to begin, the purpose of which is to allow China to have larger funds to purchase railway and telegraph materials. It is said that the amount is between four and five million British pounds, but it cannot be confirmed at present, because the negotiations are still in the preliminary stage. It is widely rumored that the British loan to China must take the form of a Sino-British currency stabilization fund, but what is certain is that there is no practical way at present and it is unlikely to be established in a short time. There is reason to believe that the United States is also considering the same method of assisting Chinese currency, but it cannot be hoped that it will be announced immediately. In addition, a method of restoring the repayment of customs-guaranteed debts is also under active negotiation. (Reuters dispatch on the 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) The Export Credit Guarantee Bureau's Expanded Powers Bill (the main point of which is to increase the guarantee amount from 50 million pounds to 75 million pounds) was recently passed by the Lower House on its third reading. Prior to this, Liberal Party member Griffiths delivered a speech saying, "If we wish to find a suitable opportunity, we must use huge funds in the Chinese side. We know deeply how the situation in China is. We also know that the Chinese people can still maintain their industry with perseverance during the war. I have heard from authoritative sources that Chinese railways have great potential for development, especially the railway line to Myanmar, which can be assisted by British industry. This is an opportunity to achieve satisfactory results and benefit both China and Britain. I don't know whether the government has designated special funds." The Minister of Overseas Trade, Hudson, immediately replied, "The supply of railway materials to China is a large-scale transaction, requiring long-term credit loans, which is not within the scope of this case. If we discuss this in the future, we will submit another bill." (Havas dispatch on the 2nd)</p>

<p>(Moscow) A correspondent from Izvestia in Chongqing reported that according to news received here from all over the country, the broad mass movement is developing and expanding everywhere, unanimously supporting all the facilities of the central government. The war has entered an unprecedented speed, intensifying the unity of the Chinese nation. Compared with the past, China can be said to be progressing rapidly, and its future is even more unlimited. At present, the Chinese National Revolutionary Army has a total of 240 divisions, and the soldiers have all the necessary armaments. In addition, there are tens of millions of people ready to join the army and take up arms to resist the enemy. Last autumn, a bumper harvest was also achieved, so food reserves are actively large, enough for military rations and civilian food. In the enemy-occupied areas, thousands and thousands of soldiers have risen up to disturb the enemy's rear. The people of the whole country feel that the enemy is becoming increasingly old and victory is in sight, so they deeply hate the traitors who compromise and surrender to the enemy. The entire Chinese people have mobilized their great strength to crush the enemy's conspiracy. Their unanimous slogan is to resist the war to the end and strive for the most victory.

<p>(Chongqing) The China Diplomacy Association held a meeting yesterday, chaired by Shao Lizi. It is reported that the theme of the discussion was the possibility of Anglo-American cooperation to stop the Japanese military from invading and occupying China. The consensus of the entire meeting was that to stop the Japanese invasion, Anglo-American cooperation was necessary. However, it was felt that there were five factors hindering such cooperation: 1. The foreign policy of the United States is restricted by the Constitution; 2. Technical difficulties hinder the cooperation of the Anglo-American navies; 3. The interests of the United States in the Pacific are concentrated in Guam and the Philippine Islands, while the interests of the United Kingdom are widely dispersed; 4. Competition in Anglo-American trade; 5. The United States has traditionally been suspicious of British policy. According to the reporter, the current obstacles are the first and fifth items. According to the attendees, these two items can be gradually improved. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>After the Hankou Japanese Consulate issues a notice</p>
<p>(Hankou) Yesterday, the Japanese Consulate here issued a notice stating that from February 10th, all third-country nationals passing through Japanese sentries must show their resident permits. This has attracted the attention of foreigners here. The Consular Corps held a meeting this afternoon to consider the matter. It is reported that it has been decided that each country will negotiate with the Japanese military authorities, generally stating that the above-mentioned method may cause misunderstandings and accidents. A Japanese military spokesperson answered reporters' questions tonight, saying that the above-mentioned notice is a kind of regulation order, which should be implemented when the Japanese army occupies the area. When asked by the reporter whether saluting the sentry means taking off one's hat and bowing, the spokesperson replied that saluting the sentry is a common habit everywhere. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) It is declared here that regarding the notification from the Japanese Consul-General in Hankou to the consulates of various countries, stating that in the future, all overseas Chinese residing in Hankou from various countries must obtain passes, the original plan was to implement it starting this Sunday (5th). Now, due to procedural issues, it has been decided to postpone the implementation to February 10th. At the same time, the French Concession in Hankou previously experienced great panic due to the Japanese authorities not allowing food to be imported. As a result, the residents of the Concession went to other streets to purchase food in large quantities. Now, for some reason, the Japanese have revoked the ban and allowed food to be transported into the French Concession. (3rd Hai Tong dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) Regarding the rumor that the German organization "Hapuluo," which was previously established in Hong Kong and had agreed with the Chinese government to exchange tung oil, tungsten products, and other minerals worth 100 million yuan, is about to be liquidated, Chinese communities here have not yet received any confirmed news. However, it is claimed that this liquidation is inevitable. China has obtained several batches of ordnance and bullets under the exchange agreement, but this action only satisfies the German side. The items provided by Germany to China include a large number of things that require little effort to use and other large quantities of manufactured goods that cannot be sold elsewhere and are useless to China. As for saying that this exchange of goods agreement can cause China's tung oil and other items to fetch higher prices in the open market, in fact, tung oil is a special product of China, and tungsten is produced in large quantities in China. Even without this Sino-German exchange of goods agreement, the whole world would still widely purchase from China, and there is no need to worry about the decline in its market price.

<p>Recently, in order to strictly prevent Chinese traitors from moving from Vietnam to Yunnan, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially instructed the Hong Kong Visa Office to conduct detailed investigations on the identities and occupations of travelers entering Yunnan in the future, and to issue passports only after obtaining reliable guarantor assurances. In order to understand the real situation of this matter, the reporter specially visited the office yesterday for inquiries, and received the following response:</p>
<p>Yunnan Province Strictly Inspects Travelers</p>
<p>It is said that since the focus of the war shifted to South China, the only transportation routes in South China are Guangzhou Bay and Haiphong. From there, one can pass through Yunnan to various parts of our country. Therefore, in order to strictly prevent Chinese traitors from entering the inland under false pretenses, the Yunnan authorities have set up a traveler entry inspection office in the Chinese area near Haiphong to strictly inspect travelers. Even those with passports must be inspected thoroughly before being allowed to pass. If it is considered slightly suspicious or the resume is unclear, it is necessary to have two reliable shops in Haiphong act as guarantors before being allowed to enter the country. In the past month, there have been dozens of cases of overseas Chinese who have already obtained passports in Hong Kong being blocked in Haiphong because they did not understand this procedure beforehand. In view of this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially instructed this office to carefully investigate the identity and occupation of those applying for passports and to issue passports only to those with guarantor assurances in order to reduce the troubles of travelers entering the inland. Recently, this office has received instructions and has issued a formal announcement.</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Visa Office Issues an Announcement</p>
<p>The announcement reads: Announcement from the Hong Kong Visa and Manifest Office of the Republic of China: It is hereby announced that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed that in the future, for nationals applying for passports to enter Yunnan via Vietnam, the identity and occupation of the passport applicant should be thoroughly investigated, and more attention should be paid to the matter of obtaining guarantees. Except for compliance with the regulations, this announcement is hereby made, and all those who apply for passports to enter Yunnan via Vietnam are requested to take note. In the future, when seeking guarantees, they should be more careful in their selection, so as not to cause self-harm. This is the announcement.</p>

<p>Brussels: The government's appointment of Dr. Malden as a member of the Flemish Institute for Medical Research has caused a storm. It is because Malden was sentenced to death for treason in 1920 and later received a pardon. Several members of Congress have introduced legislation arguing that no one who has been convicted by a court should be allowed to accept honors. The intention is to force the government to revoke the appointment. The case was recently submitted to the Chamber of Deputies for discussion. Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Spaak immediately delivered a speech, accusing the Chamber of Deputies of not making things difficult for him, and said, "If the Chamber of Deputies does not help me, it should give way to the wise. This kind of dispute only makes the Congress ridiculed." Many members of Congress were in an uproar, and the members of the Socialist Party, as well as those members and Prime Minister Spaak, insulted each other. Some members even waved their arms and fists, intending to fight. The Speaker had no choice but to adjourn the meeting. Afterwards, when Prime Minister Spaak drove back to his residence, veterans of the European War and young people held demonstrations near his residence. The car could not move forward, so the Prime Minister got out of the car and walked, but was injured on the forehead by the demonstrators. Finally, he was escorted by the police to enter his residence. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e29">The Soviet Government Announces Severance of Relations with Hungary; Following Germany and Japan has Lost its Independence; German Representative to Russia Turns Back Midway <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) Foreign Minister Litvinov notified the Hungarian Minister to Moscow, Arnoldi, today that the Soviet government had decided to close its legation in Budapest and hoped that Hungary would also close its legation in Moscow. According to TASS sources from authoritative sources, the Soviet government's decision to take the above action was due to the fact that Hungary had recently been under strong pressure from certain countries since the Munich Agreement was concluded. The Hungarian government's policies show that it has easily succumbed to this pressure and lost its independence to a considerable extent. In particular, the Hungarian government's decision to join the so-called Anti-Comintern Pact cannot be considered reasonable from the perspective of Hungary's own interests, because its interests do not coincide with those of the participants in the pact, especially the aggressive aims of Japan under the guise of the pact. Therefore, the Hungarian government's above-mentioned decision was made under external coercion. Hungary's stance has made it unnecessary for the Soviet government to maintain diplomatic relations with the country through the legations specially established in the two capitals. In the future, this relationship can be maintained through the representatives of the two countries stationed in the capitals of third countries. (2nd TASS dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) After the Soviet government suddenly severed diplomatic relations with Hungary, diplomats from various countries here, including the staff of the Hungarian Legation, were surprised. Soviet political figures said that since Hungary had signed the Anti-Comintern Pact, its stance had been undoubtedly determined. The Soviet government then resolutely severed diplomatic relations with it. This move was not only aimed at dealing with Hungary but also served to warn other countries that intended to follow in its footsteps, such as Bulgaria, Romania, Czechoslovakia, Turkey. Even Yugoslavia, which has not recognized the Soviet Union, can learn from this. Germans here have the same view of the Soviet government's move, saying that the Soviet government's communique specifically pointed out that Japan should be held responsible for the Anti-Comintern Pact, while avoiding mentioning Germany and Italy, which is noteworthy. Although the trip of Schnurre, the head of the East European Section of the Trade Department of the German Foreign Ministry, to Moscow has been postponed, the negotiations on the conclusion of a commercial agreement will not be abandoned as a result. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) The severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Hungary has recently been commented on by well-informed sources here, saying that the Soviet Union took this decisive action to warn Hungary not to be completely controlled by German forces without realizing it. Soviet figures here said that Hungary, at the request of the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact, agreed to join the Pact, which is tantamount to giving up independence. In view of this, the Soviet government decided to sever diplomatic relations with it. This matter has no common precedent in diplomatic history. Its intention is probably because the Hungarian people have always cherished national honor, and the Soviet Union specially awakened them from the side so that the people would oppose joining the Anti-Comintern Pact because of their emphasis on independence. Then, although the government has agreed to join, it may still be impossible to implement it due to the constraints of public opinion. Therefore, it is worth noting what the Hungarian public opinion will react to. Observers in France said that the Soviet Union's intention may not be limited to this, but it may also want to use this move to hint to Poland not to get too close to Germany, thereby preventing Germany from expanding its influence eastward. This move coincided with Romanian King Carol's resolute reorganization of the cabinet and strict crackdown on the fascist Iron Guard, so it is no exaggeration to say that these two events are a clever attempt to prevent Germany from invading the Ukrainian region of the Soviet Union.

<p>Warsaw: Schnurre, the head of the East European Section of the Trade Department of the German Foreign Ministry, came here a few days ago and originally planned to go to Moscow on official business, but he has now abandoned his plan and returned to Berlin today. According to foreign sources, alarming news had been released about Schnurre's trip, even saying that he intended to consult with the Soviet authorities on the issue of Germany supplying military supplies to the Soviet Union. The reason why Berlin has now summoned him back to the country may be for this reason. (2nd Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e30">Explosion Occurs on the British Underground Railway; Five People Injured <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(London) An explosion occurred in Leicester Square in London today, injuring five people, one of whom was seriously injured. An explosion also occurred on Tottenham Court Road. It is believed that someone placed a time bomb in a suitcase. Due to the repeated occurrence of explosions, the London Transport Authority has instructed all stations to immediately check the luggage storage rooms. In the future, any package must be opened by the depositor for inspection before it can be brought in. At a meeting in the House of Commons this morning, Labour leader Attlee inquired about the explosions. Home Secretary Hoare replied that explosions occurred at the Leicester Square underground station and the Tottenham Court Road station at 6 a.m. this morning, seriously injuring two people and causing considerable material damage. It was obviously caused by time bombs placed in the luggage storage room overnight. An active investigation is underway. According to the police, this kind of atrocity must have been committed by sympathizers of the Irish Republican Army. After receiving the alarm, the police rushed to the underground stations in various places and stationed themselves there permanently for defense. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) After the successive explosions at the Tottenham and Leicester underground railway stations and luggage rooms in this city at around 6 a.m. this morning, the police rushed to the scene of the incident to conduct an investigation. They immediately found several metal fragments, which appeared to be fragments of alarm clocks and have been handed over to experts for examination. The authorities believe that members of the Irish fascist faction who participated in the Spanish National Military War are suspected and are being closely investigated. At the same time, after receiving the report, the Northern Ireland government immediately launched an investigation, paying particular attention to members of the "Irish Republican Army." Last November, several checkpoints on the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic were exploded. The explosives were placed in boxes and attached to a timing mechanism, which automatically exploded in time. Based on past experience, the authorities ordered the supervisors of various stations on the underground railway in the city to check all the luggage stored in the luggage rooms to avoid similar incidents. (3rd Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Home Secretary Hoare announced in the House of Commons yesterday that 33 people had been arrested in connection with the recent series of explosions across the UK. The police are still continuing their investigations and are taking all possible preventative measures. (3rd Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) A Moscow dispatch from The Times states that the Central Committee of the Communist Party has approved the request of the Red Army's Supreme Command to reduce the power of political workers over military officers. New regulations will soon be announced, stipulating that officers above the rank of colonel, if subject to secret reports regarding political offenses, may not be indicted by low-ranking Party judicial organs within the army, nor may their conduct be discussed in meetings convened by junior officers. Only Party judicial organs composed of officers of the same or higher rank may handle such cases. The authorities have issued explanatory announcements, stating that low-ranking Party organs often abuse their power against officers they wish to humiliate, resorting to unconscious interference, thereby weakening the Red Army's strength. Now, an iron discipline is needed. Hereafter, subordinates must obey the commands of superiors, and the authority of superiors must be firmly established and fully supported by the Communist Party and the government.

<p>(London) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini is scheduled to deliver a speech at the Fascist Party meeting this afternoon. Well-informed sources here recently declared that, following German leader Hitler's speech on the 30th of last month, economic talks between Britain and the totalitarian states are possible. However, if Mussolini makes demands on France tomorrow, all hope will be dashed. Therefore, whether economic talks can proceed depends on the content of Mussolini's speech. It is generally believed that the British government may advise the Italian Prime Minister to adopt a moderate attitude before tomorrow, whether this is done through semi-official negotiations or through a personal letter from Prime Minister Chamberlain to the Italian Prime Minister remains unknown. Political circles believe that the key to the strength of the Italian Prime Minister's language lies not in British advice, but in the amount of assistance the German government can provide. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) A Berlin correspondent for The Times reports that, according to well-informed sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will use firm language to explain his demands on France tomorrow. At that time, the tense situation will begin to ease, but it will not become acute for two or three weeks. It is impossible to predict how long this crisis will last. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to the diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, a German colonial movement with significant formal changes will soon emerge. The correspondent also stated that, according to information received, all branches of the German Colonial Society have been instructed not to mention Britain's former colonies again, but to focus on demanding a larger share of colonies held or managed by other European countries of equal value. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>Munich: Today, it was formally announced that a large number of passenger trains would be suspended, which is the latest development in Germany's increasingly serious railway situation. It is reported that Germany has already canceled many express trains this year. Due to overcrowding, passengers often have to stand for long journeys or are unable to travel at all. According to a railway announcement, the heavy freight traffic necessitates further cancellation of passenger trains as a remedy. The current timetable no longer contains words like "special train," "additional passenger train," or "tourist train." Since the beginning of this year, the Berlin express has been canceled 28 times. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The "Land Post" recently reported that "German agriculture is under serious threat due to a lack of labor." The total amount of agricultural production in the country had the potential to increase this year, but this has not been achieved due to insufficient labor. "What is worse, the shortage of labor on most farmland has become very serious in recent months. Not only is there no hope of increasing production, but there is even a danger of it declining." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(New York) The American Institute of Public Opinion recently conducted a poll on the issue of Germany recovering its former colonies. The question posed was, "Should the colonies taken from Germany after the European War be returned to that country?" The results of the poll have now been released: 17 percent are in favor, and 83 percent are opposed. The majority believe that even if the colonies are returned to Germany, Hitler would still not be satisfied and would continue to make demands, so it is better not to return them. The Institute of Public Opinion conducted a poll on this issue last year, with 24 percent in favor and 76 percent opposed. Comparing the two, it can be seen that the attitude of the American people has changed. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e36">Germany Demands Submarine Equality from Britain, Note Has Been Published <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the German government's request, in accordance with the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, to increase its total submarine tonnage to be equal to that of Britain, and to increase the number of 10,000-ton Class A cruisers from five to seven, the Foreign Office issued a bulletin today stating that British and German naval representatives held friendly talks in Berlin on December 30th of last year to discuss the matter. Subsequently, on January 18th, the German government submitted a written note stating, "The German government has decided to gradually increase its total submarine tonnage from 1939 onwards, in accordance with the rights granted by the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, until it is equal to that of Britain, and to convert the two Class B cruisers currently under construction, 'K' and 'L', into Class A cruisers." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) The German request to increase its total submarine tonnage and increase the number of 10,000-ton Class A cruisers has been commented on by British naval officials. It is generally said that regarding the submarine portion, if Germany wants to increase its total tonnage to be equal to that of Britain, it is expected to take four years to achieve this goal, unless the rate of shipbuilding can be greatly increased. The existing submarine tonnage in the country ranges from 250 tons to 600 tons each. According to reliable information, the country plans to build large submarines ranging from 800 tons to 1,500 tons, with a range far exceeding that of existing submarines. Regarding the cruiser portion, Germany's request to increase the number of 10,000-ton Class A cruisers from five to seven is based on the grounds that the Soviet government is building seven such cruisers, but it has failed to provide concrete evidence. In addition, the Anglo-Soviet Naval Agreement stipulated that if Germany builds five Class A cruisers, the Soviet Union can build seven. Now that Germany has increased the number of such cruisers, the Soviet Union will inevitably follow suit in accordance with the safeguard clauses contained in the Naval Agreement, which will inevitably lead to a naval arms race.

<h3 id="e39">Roosevelt's Secret Diplomacy: Dissent Arises in the United States; Much Support for Aiding Democratic Nations; German and Italian Newspapers Indulge in Abuse <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The majority of members of Congress agree with President Roosevelt's policy of aiding democratic nations, but they say that the President's message to Congress, which stated that he would resist the threats of totalitarian states by all means short of war, was not detailed enough and should be publicly explained. As for the opposition, not all members of Congress oppose the President's current policy. For example, some Republican members of the House Foreign Affairs Committee have expressed the opinion that they do not oppose selling airplanes to democratic nations, but only on the condition that the United States does not become involved in the vortex of war. We firmly demand that the President inform the people of all the facts publicly and maintain the traditional foreign policy, that is, a neutral, non-interventionist, and peaceful policy. In short, the disagreements in Congress regarding the President's current policy are not related to fundamental issues. What is at issue is a procedural matter, namely, whether the President should implement this policy openly or keep it secret. The members of Congress cannot agree on this point. The majority of Democrats trust the President, while a minority of Democrats and Republicans want the President to provide detailed explanations. Regarding the actual situation, some Republicans, including Senator Austin, advocate restoring the neutral policy that existed before the European War, that is, supplying arms to all countries without discrimination, and at the same time protecting freedom of the seas in the event of war. Other members of the party, such as Senator Nye, say that arms should not be exported abroad even in peacetime. However, in order to avoid internal strife within the party, they would rather not discuss these fundamental issues and instead unite with a minority of "rebellious" Democrats to criticize the government on procedural issues, namely, that it should not keep secrets. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(New York) Newspaper criticisms of President Roosevelt's new policy mostly regret the secrecy of American diplomacy. The New York World-Telegram said that the President's bold and direct foreign policy is admirable, but the American people have the right to know about serious matters related to war and peace. This seems to be a very important issue. The Chicago Tribune said that the White House has become a palace. The President's actions are like those of an autocratic monarch, and his people cannot say a word about their own destiny and can be dragged into war as easily as the Hessians of 18th-century Germany. The Washington Post said that the government's efforts to facilitate the sale of airplanes to France are a factor in easing the current tension in Europe. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Due to much criticism from Congress regarding the United States' sale of airplanes to Britain and France, Interior Secretary Ickes came forward today to declare that the government's policy will not lead the United States into the vortex of war, and will also curb the outbreak of war. Ickes's remarks were aimed specifically at former President Hoover's attacks on the government's foreign policy. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) US President Roosevelt continues to be the target of fierce attacks in German newspapers. The Hamburger Tageblatt even called him "the number one enemy of peace." Official circles still believe that the informal news of this secret meeting of the US government committee should not be formally criticized, but said that if President Roosevelt really made such remarks, then a serious view must be taken of them. It is said that no protest has yet been lodged with Washington. The authorities have instructed the newspapers to attack as much as possible, and the tone of the German newspapers' attacks on President Roosevelt is more personal than before. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After US President Roosevelt decided to aid the democratic countries of Europe, the German newspapers have expressed indignation, saying that Roosevelt has "colluded with Third International Secretary-General Dimitrov," and the American people are therefore facing a "red crisis." It is also said that Roosevelt's policy will inevitably encounter greater resistance within the United States, which can be asserted with certainty. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) After US President Roosevelt held secret talks with members of the Senate Army Committee, indicating his willingness to aid the democratic countries of Europe, the newspapers here began to attack him fiercely today, saying that President Roosevelt "intends to overthrow the political systems of totalitarian states, incite Latin American countries to resist totalitarian states, and begin an arms race." Il Popolo d'Italia, traditionally known as the mouthpiece of Prime Minister Mussolini, said, "The Roosevelt seen by world opinion is no longer just a person suffering from hysteria (excessive excitement), but is completely mad. The White House in Washington is a madhouse, not a presidential palace, and those who serve there are nurses, not Jews and thugs who deliberately incite war. This should no longer be surprising." The newspaper then took the opportunity to attack France, saying that France expressed joy after hearing Roosevelt's remarks, which is probably another illusion. If the efforts of the totalitarian states to establish a fair peace in Europe are ignored by others, causing war in Europe, then the United States should not be surprised, "for its borders in France have already been broken by us." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Ottawa: After US President Roosevelt issued a statement saying that he would aid the democratic countries of Europe, a government official close to the government told a Havas News Agency reporter that the Canadian government was very satisfied with this, and hoped that the current US Neutrality Act could be amended so that Canada could purchase military supplies from the US in wartime. In addition, the Montreal Star reported, "President Roosevelt's statement is the best news internationally since the establishment of the Versailles Treaty. Public opinion, which firmly resists the totalitarian states' policy of aggression, is thus even more powerful. Therefore, Roosevelt's move is the most important factor in preserving world peace." (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>Los Angeles: Regarding the recent bomber test flight accident, a shocking discovery has been made. According to officials here, the accident may have been caused by sabotage by Nazi spies. The Western Seaboard branch of the "Industrial Improvement Association" chairman, Bridgeman, wired President Roosevelt that Nazi spies and sympathizers were actively working at the "North American Aviation Plant" to sabotage the airplanes being built for the US government. It is said that several members of the "German-American Bund" (an organization of Americans who sympathize with the Nazis) are suspected. It is reported that when the ill-fated plane crashed, French Aviation Ministry representative Schmidlin was participating in the test flight and died at the scene. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) In his defense message to Congress on January 12, President Roosevelt requested an appropriation of US$50 million to restore operations at idle airplane factories in order to immediately implement the accelerated airplane construction plan. Several members of the House Appropriations Committee therefore visited President Roosevelt this month to discuss technical aspects. The meeting lasted one and a half hours. Afterwards, the members said that, in the President's opinion, the international situation was such that this bill urgently needed to be passed without amendment. (Havas, 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e41">International Situation Tense, Hong Kong Authorities Busy Preparing for War, Army and Navy Increase Recruitment of Volunteers, Air Defense Equipment Effectively Strengthened <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Since the beginning of this month, the international situation has become increasingly tense. The Spanish Civil War rebels' occupation of Barcelona, Italy's demand for colonies from France to satisfy its so-called "natural desires," increasing troops on the borders of French territories in East Africa, and echoing Germany, all are sufficient to trigger a second World War. In the Far East, the advent of the Hiranuma Cabinet in Japan has intensified its offensive against China, repeatedly declaring that it will not hesitate to fight China and Russia simultaneously and that it will not hesitate to have a head-on conflict with Britain and occupy Hong Kong. Therefore, the prelude to an international war in the Pacific is also on the verge of breaking out. For this reason, the Hong Kong authorities, in order to prevent problems before they occur, have recently been actively strengthening the defense capabilities of the army, navy, and air force, and engaging in various wartime preparations. Some Chinese high-ranking refugees who have taken refuge in Hong Kong regard this small island in the South China Sea as a paradise, but they do not know that this "haven of peace" that is peaceful all year round is actually a volcano. The recent war preparations of the Hong Kong authorities are briefly described below.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Army</p>
<p>Hong Kong is an island, and in future wars, the army will not be as important. However, the experienced British do not neglect the expansion of the army's strength because of this. The current number of troops in Hong Kong is a military secret, and we cannot find out. However, judging from the repeated reinforcements in the past year, it can be seen that the number is already considerable. Recently, the Hong Kong government has also newly established a large number of wooden barracks near the Seven Sisters swimming pool in Hong Kong and transferred four new battalions of troops to be stationed there. These four new battalions are British defense forces stationed in Hong Kong for a long time. Therefore, the total number of British troops stationed in Hong Kong is now more than 10,000. The Hong Kong authorities are also working hard to recruit British, Indian, and Chinese people in Hong Kong to join the volunteer army. As a result of repeated recruitment, the total number of volunteers is now several thousand. The training and organization of the volunteer army are the same as those of the regular army, and they are divided into infantry, artillery, and navy. Like the regular army, they are trying their best to mechanize it. Taking the army volunteers as an example, they are divided into rifle teams, machine gun teams, armored vehicle teams, and mechanized teams. As for the degree of mechanization of the regular army, it is even more amazing. In addition to the original motorcycle team, armored vehicle team, and mechanized team, the latest tanks will also be delivered recently, making the army's strength more and more powerful. Artillery, which is closely related to the army, is undoubtedly important in Hong Kong's defense. The strength of the fortifications built in Hong Kong in the past two years is already amazing, and the strengthening of the artillery's strength is also increasing day by day. Recently, the caliber of the artillery positions in the major and minor forts near Stanley and Sai Wan has been enlarged, and important equipment such as automatic measuring instruments has been added. At the same time, a large number of secret artillery positions and machine gun nests have been built, and the recruitment and training of Chinese artillery volunteers are being carried out actively.</p>
<p>Strengthening the Navy</p>
<p>Hong Kong's naval power is also very strong. There are more than 30 warships stationed for a long time. These warships regularly patrol and exercise in Hong Kong's territorial waters, and the sound of cannons is already a common sight. In addition to various warships, there are also aircraft carriers, torpedo boats, etc. Recently, the naval exercises of various warships have been intensified. Even torpedo boats, which are not usually exercised, have been crisscrossing the bottom of the blue sea in twos and threes in recent days. The Hong Kong government has also spared no effort in recruiting, organizing, and training naval volunteers. There are now more than 2,000 Chinese and Indian people who have joined the naval volunteer army, but the naval authorities are still continuing to recruit. The organization of these volunteers is divided into mine sweeping teams, mine laying teams, patrol teams, inspection teams, telecommunications teams, signal teams, sailor teams, etc. If an emergency occurs, all of them can be mobilized to participate in combat. At the same time, a blockade ship was shipped from England a week ago. This type of blockade ship is specially used for blockading and opening up seaports. The ship is very large and equipped with various blockade materials and machinery. Its activities are extremely convenient. If a war breaks out, the ship can firmly block the seaport in a few hours, making it impossible for enemy ships to break in. If the situation becomes stable, the blockades can be completely removed in a few hours. Therefore, this new type of blockade weapon is a pioneering achievement in the Far East.</p>
<p>Intensifying Air Defense</p>
<p>The Hong Kong authorities pay even more attention to air defense than to the army and navy. The current preparations for air force strength and air defense capabilities are quite adequate. Therefore, in recent months, there have been no reports of adding aircraft, building airfields, or other such matters. However, aircraft are dispatched from time to time to conduct bombing exercises, and the underground anti-aircraft guns also conduct live ammunition exercises accordingly. For example, on the 9th and 10th of this month, the air force authorities dispatched several bombers carrying many 500-pound and 250-pound bombs to bomb the areas around Ma Shi Wan and Shek Ngau Wan in rotation, while the underground anti-aircraft artillery teams fired fiercely from morning to night. The performance of the air raid was extremely tense. As for the installation of alarm machines, there are currently 14 units, and 20 newer and more complete units are being shipped from England and will arrive in Hong Kong for assembly next month. Once the assembly is completed, a large-scale night raid exercise will be held. As for the volunteer team for air defense, 8,000 people have been recruited so far, and 5,000 more are being recruited. These 13,000 air defense volunteers will be divided into 2,000 posts to guide residents in air defense and bomb shelters. The types of organizations are divided into alarm, medical, rescue, engineering, fire, disinfection, ambulance drivers, and delivery. As for the construction of air raid shelters, it is also being carried out actively. It is divided into three types: one is the air raid shelter with a very large scale built by the government with funds; one is to use the large buildings in the prosperous streets to open rooms for bomb shelters; and one is to encourage private individuals to dig bomb shelters in their residential gardens. Six months ago, the Hong Kong authorities only divided the construction of bomb shelters into two types: one was to use large buildings, and the other was to try to build several bomb shelters with flat roofs and green paint on the racecourse. However, in view of the indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft in the Sino-Japanese War, even tall Western-style buildings cannot avoid being penetrated to the bottom, and bomb shelters exposed on the ground are only enough to avoid fragments of bombs. If a bomb hits, deaths and injuries will still be inevitable. Therefore, the air defense authorities have recently abandoned this plan and plan to build extremely large-scale bomb shelters in the mountains, while doing their best to encourage private construction and hoping that all engineers will pay attention to this when designing and building houses. As for poison gas prevention, in addition to strengthening poison gas prevention equipment, they also plan to purchase a large number of anti-trial masks from the United Kingdom and distribute them to residents for use, and the value of each mask is only one yuan. The Hong Kong authorities can be said to be doing their best.</p>

<p>Ningbo Correspondence: At 2:40 pm on the 1st, a Japanese warship No. 4 was discovered in Xiangshan Port. It sailed from Huangsha Port to Hengshan Port in Yindong and moored. It immediately used machine guns to strafe passing sea ships and civilian ships, and lowered speedboats to intercept civilian ships. Two cargo ships were hijacked and the boatmen were arrested for questioning, and then they were released. In the evening, the warship used searchlights to illuminate the coast. The coastal defense troops have been placed on strict alert.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Qingpu Puppet Yao Miaoling Takes the Stage <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Qingpu Correspondence: After the establishment of the Qingpu puppet county government, Bao Nanshan was appointed as the puppet magistrate. After the guerrilla team led by Tian Xiu came out and recovered Zhujiajiao, and the puppet pacification commander Yang Anxin was captured, Bao Nanshan fled without a trace. The Japanese troops stationed in Qingpu listened to the plan of Ye Changyi, the puppet "police chief," and Zhujiajiao was thus occupied for the second time. The puppet magistrate was then concurrently held by Ye. Now, Yao Miaoling, originally from Shanghai, has had dealings with the Japanese side for a long time. After much lobbying with the puppet provincial government, she was appointed as the puppet magistrate of Qingpu County a few days ago. Yao took the stage in full makeup one day. Zhang Jiayao, Wang Daoxing, Chen Qisheng, Xu Boxin, Qin Shuqiu, etc., who were preparing the stage for Yao, went to the countryside to organize the puppet unified tax bureau. Wang Daoxing and Jin Xueyu were the puppet finance bureau's director and deputy director, respectively. Qin Shuqiu and Zhang Jiayao concurrently served as the director and deputy director of the puppet collection office.</p>
<h3 id="e44">The New Fourth Army Attacks Jiaxing Pinghu, A County Government is Established in the Suburbs of Jiaxing <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence: After the New Fourth Army arrived in Haiyan Haining, it advanced towards Jiaxing. The army's cadres sent a special service chief, Tao Liu, to Jiaxing to contact Jiang Shuwei, the commander of the new ×× division south of Jiaxing. He decided to extract the elite troops of his department to attack Jiaxing. The district chiefs of the county and the captains of the detachments have all been appointed. Zhao Chi, the county magistrate appointed by the provincial government, has also established a county government in the suburbs of Jiaxing to exert combat power nearby. The Pingjia Highway has long been completely destroyed. Many huge notices from Gu Zhutong were found in Xinfeng, the center of the road. The Jiaxing Japanese army had originally registered a unit from the headquarters. After being defeated by Zhu Xi's troops of the Chinese army between Wuzhen and Xinshi, the Japanese army cadres replaced them with the Koizumi unit. After the Koizumi unit arrived in Jiaxing, it forced the puppet county government to organize a railway protection association to specifically plan methods to protect the railway. Therefore, the Baos used the strong to draw strong men to organize a road protection team. The county's strong men were unwilling to be drawn and fled one after another. Recently, cannon fire has been rumbling around Jiaxing. Shen Junsheng's troops of the ×× division once stormed the Pinghu county seat and repelled the Japanese army in the Zhuhang Street and Xiaojie areas. The Japanese army in Pinghu retreated into the city and did not dare to go out. At the same time, Fan Jicai's troops of the Chinese army also defeated the Japanese army between Chongde, Shiwan, and Zhouquan, killing more than 40 people and seizing countless military supplies.</p>
<h3 id="e45">Adapting to the Needs of the War of Resistance, Guangxi Province Strengthens the People's Military Strength, Carefully Selects County Magistrates for the Gendarmerie Areas, and Sets Up Self-Defense Regiments in Various Districts and Townships <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>Guangxi Correspondence: After the Xijiang Sanshui Estuary was occupied by the Japanese army, the military affairs of Guangxi Province have been greatly threatened. Recently, the Japanese fleet has once again gathered on Weizhou Island in the South Road, and there is a tendency to attack Beihai and advance into Nanning. Therefore, the national defense of Guangxi Province has been further strengthened, and at the same time, political issues have also been re-adjusted, so that the military and the people can jointly seek close unity to enhance the strength of the war of resistance. What has been put into practice is the various counties on the border of Guangxi, such as Cangwu, Huaiji, Cenxi, Rongxian, Yulin, Luchuan, Yongchun, etc., which are all connected to the Xijiang South Road of Guangdong Province. Once a war breaks out, the border counties will bear the brunt. Therefore, the authorities pay special attention to ensuring that the local people cooperate unanimously and assume the responsibility of defending Greater Guangxi. The outline has been stipulated as follows: (1) Adjust the grass-roots political personnel in various districts, townships, towns, villages, and streets to achieve military-civilian cooperation; (2) Strengthen the grass-roots people's military strength, assist in the work of resisting the war and eliminating traitors, and maintain local security. Based on the need to promote the above two things, and on the principle of local people handling local affairs, before the implementation of the popular election of county magistrates in various counties of the province, the county magistrates of the gendarmerie areas will be appointed first by people from this county. The current Cangwu county magistrate is Yan Haifeng, Tengxian is He Qi, Cenxi is Huang Guidan, Rongxian is Huang Weifang, Yulin is Jiang Wu, Pingnan County is Zheng Xiangchou, and Yongchun is Chen Wenzhong. Regarding the adjustment of the first item, the district, township, town, village chiefs used to be selected by the provincial and county governments from the cadres and training personnel of other counties or other townships. Since the adjustment, all of them have been changed to people from this district, township, town, village, and their qualifications are not limited to cadre training. It is necessary to see how their reputation is in the local area and whether they have the ability to call on the people to make a judgment. Since Guangxi Province implemented the policy of the trinity, all grass-roots political township and village chiefs must concurrently serve as the captain of the reserve team in the township and the principal of the elementary school, and the person must have been trained as a cadre for six months. The district and township chiefs are all young people, and they are courageous but lack experience in handling local affairs. Therefore, it is necessary to re-adjust the grass-roots politics of the districts and townships. Recently, the chiefs of various districts, townships, villages, and streets have all been appointed by local people, and they are not limited to cadres and training and the qualifications stipulated before. This is the reason. Regarding the second item, the most urgent thing is the organization of local self-defense and guerrilla warfare. The authorities, in view of the current needs of the war of resistance, decided to strengthen the military strength of various districts and townships: (1) The county governments must enrich the original organization of the district and township offices or expand the scope of the districts; (2) Each district office must set up a self-defense team (or guerrilla team) of at least 30 people or more, depending on the local economic strength; (3) Each township office must set up at least one self-defense team (11 or 12 people) to effectively protect the security of the township. The firearms in various districts and townships can be transferred from the county's civilian firearms, and the government will supply them with ammunition. As for the expenses, they will be planned by the counties and districts as a whole. After the military organizations in various districts and townships are enriched, they will be scattered in the villages to maintain local security and protect wartime production. When they are combined, they can take on guerrilla warfare and assist the regular army in formal operations.</p>
<h3 id="e46">Japanese and Puppet Governments Poison Yangzhou, Opium Dens are Everywhere <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>Huaiyin Correspondence: Since Yangzhou fell last year, the people have been squeezed by the Japanese and puppet governments, as if in a hell on earth. Recently, rampant bandits have emerged one after another. Now the Japanese army is trying to poison the entire Jiangdu with vicious means. Opium dens have been set up everywhere in the city, almost everywhere. They are divided into grades and receive donations on a monthly basis. Ordinary petty criminals and hooligans mix in there day and night. There are more than 500 opium dens in the whole city, and the poisonous gas is pervasive, making it dark and dark. Wang Pingzhang, the puppet "anti-smoking bureau" chief, also sends his minions to extort money from time to time, threatening to arrest and stop, and the income is huge. Now the Japanese army in Yangzhou is very panicked about supplies and searches the surrounding countryside from time to time, causing the price of rice to be as high as 15 or 6 yuan per stone, and it is still not available. As a result, the lives of the general public are extremely difficult. Under the oppression of the Japanese and puppet governments, they cannot survive and cannot die. Therefore, armed resistance from the people is often heard. Now there is a great internal conflict among the Japanese army. Therefore, Ogawa, the commander of the Japanese army in Yangzhou, has been ordered to be transferred to Nanjing. The captain of the Italian army and the deputy squad leader of the special service squad have also been ordered to be transferred to other places. As for the suburbs, the guerrillas have been unusually active recently, and the Japanese army is panicked. There are fewer than 300 puppet troops stationed in the city. A few days ago, more than 200 people were arrested in the surrounding countryside and detained in the Japanese headquarters, where they were tied up and beaten severely. After being interrogated by the Japanese commander, they were released on bail. Currently, there are still five or six people who have not been released. Therefore, the inspection of pedestrians at the four gates has been very strict recently, and a special curfew is imposed every day at 4 pm to prevent the Chinese guerrillas from attacking.</p>

<p>Ningbo Correspondence: The Civil Affairs Department of Zhejiang Province believes that the household registration surveys in this province over the years have not been very accurate, causing difficulties in handling military service in various counties. Now, in order to make a reliable statistic on the ages of Class A and B conscripts, it has been decided to conduct a general household registration re-check throughout the province. The re-check forms have been drafted and issued to the county magistrates of various counties for preparation in advance. On April 1st of this year, the district and township offices and the staff of various agencies and public schools will be mobilized to participate in the re-check in one day.</p>

<p>Changshu Correspondence: Xu Fengzao, the commander of the Fourth District of the Puppet Pacification Army, recently recruited more than 90 puppet troops. Two Japanese instructors, Sato and Yamaguchi, took several trucks from Dazhi Company from Wuxi to Yu. When passing through Dongting, they were suddenly attacked by more than 200 people from the Yunlingen unit of the guerrilla team from the side of the Xihu Highway. Bullets rained down. The Japanese officer, Sato, was also injured, and several puppet police were killed. Seven or eight guerrillas were killed, and a truck driver was injured in the foot. After arriving in Changshu, he was sent to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e49">The Second Year of the War of Resistance, Production and Sales of Sichuan Province Commodities (2) (Continued), Imported Goods are Reduced Due to Transportation Difficulties, Local Products are Still Inevitably Backlogged <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Those with more inventory can generally make a profit, but six have closed down due to lack of goods, and more than ten have reduced their scale and changed their brands. However, there are also more than ten silk merchants who have moved to Chongqing from other places. Next is Suzhou goods. The so-called Suzhou goods include foreign goods and Guangdong goods. Four or five years ago, it was a very prosperous era, with a total annual turnover of more than 8 million yuan. Last year, it was only more than 2 million yuan. The total import volume for the whole year last year was more than 21,900 pieces, and small items sent by mail accounted for one-half. The general price of goods is one-quarter higher than before the war. Woolen products have increased especially. The price before the war was 2.78 yuan per pound, and it has risen to more than 5 yuan after the war. Thermos bottles are very popular. Before the war, each dozen was 11 or 12 yuan, and recently it costs 45 or 6 yuan. Last year, there were more than 130 Suzhou goods shops in the city, and more than 20 Chongqing help merchant houses were all closed. However, more than 30 shops that moved to Chongqing from other places have increased. Each shop has a slight surplus. It is still very difficult to import goods from other provinces this year. It is hoped that the Suzhou goods factories that have moved to Sichuan can quickly produce more goods to meet the needs. It is also hoped that someone can transport a large number of goods to the southwestern provinces for sale. Next is hardware and electrical materials. The monthly import volume before the war was usually 500 tons. After the war, less than 200 tons were transferred and imported through the Yuehan Railway. After the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, it was less than 20 tons per month. However, the total annual turnover last year was more than 4 million yuan, which is one-third more than the previous year. This is purely due to the high price of goods. For example, the price of foreign nails was only 17 or 8 yuan per box before the war. Last year, the highest price rose to 130 yuan, and the current market price is still more than 90 yuan. For example, the price of pig iron was only more than 100 yuan per ton before the withdrawal from Hankou. After the withdrawal from Hankou, it gradually rose to 900 yuan. Recently, it still costs 700 yuan. The general price of goods is three times higher than before the war, and at least one time higher. The most popular ones are pig iron, steel plate, yuan bars, cement steel bones. The most lacking ones are foreign nails, lead wire, steel plate, telephone sets, flower wire, electrical magnetic materials, and bakelite materials. There were more than 40 hardware stores in the city in the previous year, all of which also operated electrical materials. One-quarter of them closed down last year. However, more than ten new ones have moved from Shanghai, Beijing, and Hankou, and all of them have a surplus. The German goods used to be the first in terms of import. After the war, because they had to be transshipped through Hong Kong, the import of British and American goods has also been able to balance with German goods. Next is dried vegetables. The total import volume in the previous year was 20,926 pieces, and only 5,832 pieces last year. The reason for this decline is partly due to transportation difficulties and partly due to the fact that most of the dried vegetables are Japanese goods, which are subject to boycott. The price of goods has increased by more than double compared to before the war. Because most of the goods are not necessities, the business is not as good as other import businesses. Nineteen companies announced their closure last year. This year, due to the reduced sources and the difficulty in sales, I am afraid that there will be more closures. Next is paint. The paint industry in Chongqing, after the exhausted atmosphere of the Italian and Afghan situation in previous years, did not dare to import more. The total import volume in the previous year was 4,500 pieces, and even less last year. The total turnover in the 26th year was 3 million yuan. Although the number was less than in the previous year, the turnover was about the same as in the previous year due to the high price. The general price is more than double compared to before the war. The most popular Quick Indigo Lion Horse Brand had a market price of 4 yuan per catty before the war, and it rose to about 8.5 yuan last year. But there are also those that are several times higher. For example, black indigo powder had a market price of only 80 yuan before the war, and the highest price rose to 450 yuan last year, and recently it has fallen to 370 or 80 yuan. The paint market has always been controlled by four foreign companies, German Defu, British Bunny Mun, American Hengxin, and Nanxing. They either set up their own shops in Chongqing or specially contracted local paint shops to act as agents. Last year, many merchants who operated mountain goods and paper also operated paint because they saw that paint was profitable. They either imported goods directly from Shanghai and Hankou or bought them from the city. The foreign companies could no longer control it. Last year, the one that occupied an important position among the imported goods in Chongqing was the rearguard, Western medicine. The total import volume of Western medicine in the entire Sichuan Province in the previous year reached more than 3 million yuan. Last year, it was only more than 1 million yuan. Chongqing's imports accounted for 70 or 80% of the entire Sichuan Province. The general price has increased by about two times, or even three times. For example, soda ash (120 pounds per unit) was only 15 or 6 yuan before the war, and it rose to about 100 yuan after June last year. Due to the difficulty in importing goods, four Western medicine shops with smaller scale have announced their closure. The German Qianxin imported the most goods and made the most profit.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to tell the readers that the revenue of Chongqing Customs from July 26 to June 27, the first year of the war of resistance, was still more than 4 million. The surface of the market is still very prosperous. The Southwest Association is raising funds of 100,000 yuan from members in Shanghai and Chongqing to set up a local products company to manage the improvement of local products and adjust the production and sales business. Other private organizations that trade in local products and foreign goods are also emerging like mushrooms after a rain. If transportation is fast and supply is unblocked in the future, it will not be difficult to achieve the goal of exchanging what we have for what we do not have to meet the actual needs.

<h3 id="e50">Commercial News Financial: Tianjin Group Uses Legal Tender to Buy Gold, Speculation Reaches New Heights, Circulation of Chips Increasingly Scarce, Closing Price at 2,054 Yuan <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash speculation market showed continued strong gains. This was due to the continued tightening of foreign exchange, coupled with vigorous buying by wealthy merchants and securities firms in this city, as well as groups from the north. However, the morning saw active sales by silver shops and gold firms, which limited the gains. In the afternoon, foreign exchange became even tighter due to the concerted efforts of Western merchant Sassoon, the Tianjin group, and foreign firms, which stirred up sentiment and drove buyers into a frenzy. The Tianjin group continued to buy aggressively, and silver shops became less willing to sell. Although some holders took profits, the supply of circulating chips on the market remained scarce, pushing the price past the 50 yuan mark to close at a high of 2,054 yuan for the day, a sharp increase of 17 yuan. Trading was extremely active, reaching 1,100 taels. Silver jewelry also rose by one yuan accordingly. The customs gold and Sino-British pure gold prices remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Cash Up 17 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, securities firms initially bid 2,038 yuan per bar (ten taels), but sellers demanded an additional 40 yuan before agreeing to sell. The two sides haggled until 9:45 AM, when silver shops finally sold 50 taels to securities firms at 2,040 yuan, setting the opening price. After the opening, money changers suddenly rushed to buy, pushing the price higher. Money changers bought 50 taels from silver shops at 42 yuan. Although securities firms continued to buy aggressively, silver shops and cash firms supplied ample amounts, halting the rise and causing a decline. Securities firms bought 50 taels from cash firms and 100 taels from silver shops, both at 40 yuan. Silver shops sold 50 taels each to money changers and the Northern group, both at 38 yuan. During this period, a certain silver shop suddenly bought 100 taels on behalf of a wealthy merchant in this city at the same price, supplied by fellow merchants. Subsequently, a certain gold firm forcefully supplied 100 taels at the same price, all taken in by fellow merchants and clients. At the same price, money changers again bought 50 taels from the gold firm. Near noon, news broke that foreign exchange was tightening again due to the buying by foreign firms, causing sellers to become scarce and prices to rise again. Money changers bought 50 taels from silver shops at 40 yuan for the noon closing price. The situation was relatively calm at the beginning of the afternoon. At 2:15 PM, a certain money changer was first seen buying again on behalf of the Tianjin group, taking 50 taels from fellow merchants at 42 yuan, followed by another 50 taels at 43 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange was being aggressively bought by Western merchant Sassoon, the Tianjin group, and foreign firms, further tightening the market and causing the supply of sellers on the market to become even scarcer, and the price soared. Silver shops traded 50 taels among themselves at 45 yuan. A certain money changer then aggressively bought more than 200 taels on behalf of the Tianjin group, pushing the price from 45 yuan to 54 yuan, all supplied by silver shops and fellow merchants. By 3:40 PM (it was said that sellers were taking profits), sellers, seeing that the foreign exchange tightening had subsided, rushed to sell, but buyers remained on the sidelines, still unable to find counterparties even at 50 yuan. Only one money changer bid at 46-47 yuan, but no trades occurred. Therefore, the evening closing price was the same as the daily high of 2,054 yuan, a 17 yuan increase compared to the previous day, marking the third consecutive day of gains, totaling 35 yuan. The selling price of the cash firms' own brand of gold was 2,060 yuan, with a buying price of 2,045 yuan. Spot gold was quoted about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, but no trades occurred.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold at 208 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of silver jewelry had not changed initially, but when speculation again passed the 50 yuan mark at 3:15 PM in the afternoon, the price increased by one yuan. Da Tong Heng, Lao Qing Yun, and other shops raised their prices to 208 yuan, while newer shops raised theirs to 206 yuan, with a buying price of 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Tends to Stagnate</p>
<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 2nd reported that the price of English pure gold remained unchanged at £7, 8 shillings, and 7.5 pence per ounce, leaving the Central Bank's buying price for Chinese cash at 1,213 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price of customs gold remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 7 li. The Shanghai standard gold bar price also remained unchanged at 1,208 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>

<p>A Reuters dispatch from London on the 2nd reported limited trading by speculators buying and selling, with a generally flat market. After closing, the market remained flat. Some in India wanted to sell at a price 0.0625 higher than the listed price. Near-term and long-term silver bars remained unchanged. A New York silver dispatch reported that the price of American silver remained stagnant. A Bombay silver dispatch reported that the Indian silver market was calm, with spot, near-term, and long-term prices all up one anna.</p>
<h3 id="e52">North China Restricts Legal Tender Circulation, Wealthy Buy Foreign Currency, Market Prices Rise Sharply <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the prices of English pure gold and Anglo-American exchange rates remained unchanged. Foreign exchange was in high demand by foreign firms, and Japanese banks continued to buy relentlessly. Although the supply of foreign currency continued unabated, domestic demand still exceeded supply, leading to weaker market prices. Speculation in legal tender was strong due to the weakness in foreign exchange. Hong Kong firms bought in the beginning, and Tianjin firms collected later, leading to soaring market prices, as predicted. Because legal tender chips were scarce, they were easily manipulated. Occasional purchases by large players caused market prices to soar. Now, the puppet organizations in North China, acting as henchmen, are working hard to undermine the legal tender. It is said that circulation will be suspended starting next month. Wealthy individuals are panicked and are vigorously buying cash for hoarding, not seeking the revitalization of industry, but always acting out of unconscious blind obedience. Therefore, wealthy individuals are also buying foreign currency vigorously, with heavy trading in British and American gold pounds and British and American gold notes. Supply is not smooth, and market prices are rising sharply, showing a strong trend. Trading at the guild was not active, with only Yong Feng selling and San Tai buying 50 pounds of English gold notes. Qin Tai sold and Tong Shuang bought 50 pounds of English gold notes. Yesterday's market prices: English gold pounds rose 5 jiao and 5 fen, English gold notes rose 2 jiao and 7 fen, American gold pounds rose 4 jiao, American gold notes rose 4 fen and 7 li, Hong Kong notes rose 1 fen and 4 li, French franc notes rose 1.5 li, Singapore notes rose 2 fen, Dutch notes fell 1 fen, rupee notes rose 2.5 fen, Canadian notes rose 4 fen, Australian gold notes rose 2 jiao. Only Annam notes, Italian notes, German gold notes, and Siamese notes remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Discount Levels <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange draft bills was slightly weak but ultimately leveled out, ranging from 36 yuan to 36.5 yuan per thousand, with the final rate at 36.5 yuan, the same as the previous day.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw Chinese and Western speculators and foreign firms like Sassoon competing to buy. It was also heard that Tianjin foreign banks wired to buy in order to offset the legal tender balances of Tianjin banks. The supply of Hong Kong telegrams was also weak, causing underlying conditions to continue to soften. Midday fluctuations remained significant, and trading was brisk. The Hong Kong exchange rate tightened step by step as money changers were not eager to sell and various foreign banks were actively buying. The shilling weakened to 8.25 pence, and the US exchange rate was 16.09375 yuan.</p>
<p>In the morning, London silver bars were generally level for both near-term and long-term contracts, the New York silver price was unchanged, London raw gold did not change, the Anglo-American exchange rate was the same, the Anglo-French rate was a small 3 centimes, the Anglo-Shanghai rate was level, the US-Anglo rate fell 0.0625, the US-French rate fell 0.1875, and the US-Shanghai rate fell 5 fen. The exchange rates listed by the Central Bank were stagnant as before. At the opening, banks quoted a spot selling price of 8.296875 pence for the English exchange rate and 16.1875 yuan for the US exchange rate, a decrease of 0.015625 compared to the previous closing price for English exchange and the same for US exchange. After the opening, Hong Kong telegrams were first sold to Hua Bi, Youli, and Mai Jiali English gold at 8.296875 and 8.28125 pence, and to Youli American Bank US exchange at 16.1875 yuan, with the situation generally level. The HSBC listing and the revelation of the silver balance tax remained unchanged. Later, foreign firms aggressively bought American Bank US exchange at only 16.15625 yuan, and bought only HSBC English gold at 8.28125 pence. In addition, Dutch Anda also bought Hong Kong exchange from money changers, shrinking it from 56 yuan to 55.75 yuan. After this, underlying conditions were quite weak. At the noon close, banks quoted a selling price of 8.28125 pence for the English exchange rate and 16.15625 yuan for the US exchange rate.</p>
<p>In the afternoon market, foreign firms came to buy HSBC English gold paper at 8.25 pence. In addition, Tianjin foreign banks also bought from foreign banks at the same price. Western merchant Sassoon also followed suit, buying English gold from Chinese yarn and cotton firms at 8.25 pence and US exchange at 16.125 yuan, making the process increasingly weak. Later, Hong Kong telegrams were again offered to American Bank Datong US exchange at 16.125 yuan, so the situation was slightly level. The Hong Kong exchange rate was increasingly solid as Hua Yi Anda competed to buy from money changers at only 55.35 and 55.25 yuan, causing the market price to become more solid. At the evening close, banks quoted a selling price of 8.25 pence for the English exchange rate and 16.09375 yuan for the US exchange rate, resulting in a decrease of 0.0625 for English exchange and a tightening of 0.09375 for US exchange compared to the previous close. Hong Kong exchange also shrank by 0.75.</p>

<p>Sales of dried lily flowers have been sluggish recently due to weak demand, and goods from Jiangbei have continued to arrive, causing prices to weaken. Top-grade, plump, and brightly colored flower strips, which previously opened at 39 yuan, only saw slight transactions yesterday. Approximately 22 packages were sold, opening at 35.5 yuan, a drop of about 4 yuan. Top-grade wholesale prices were quoted at 35-36 yuan, with subsequent prices ranging from 32 yuan to 22-23 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Sugar Market: Chaoqing Prices Exceptionally Firm <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar guild quoted a price of 23.9 yuan for spot #24 Dutch coarse white, down slightly by 0.1 yuan. Taikoo cart white B mark was priced at 23.5 yuan. According to a Shantou dispatch regarding domestic sugar, demand from Tianjin and other areas had not weakened, making Chaoqing the firmest. The price for premium Chaoqing was quoted at 14.6 yuan, Huanggang Qing at 14.2-3 yuan, Shangzhi red at 15 yuan, and both Zhiyang Qi white and Sanjian white were in short supply at around 24 yuan, deterring Shanghai firms from buying. Yesterday, 160 bags of sugar arrived from Shantou.</p>
<h3 id="e57">Industrial and Commercial Discussion: The Pound Revolution and its Impact <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>London is the capital of the world's gold market and the center of international finance. This superior position has created the pound's leading position in the world's currency market. However, it has now become one of the main factors trampling on the pound. As world gold prices have soared due to the preparations for war in various countries, the pound has been held back by exchange rates and cannot keep up. This has turned into a drop in the domestic value of the pound. In addition, the British treasury has turned from a surplus to a deficit in recent years, and foreign trade and international payments have also experienced deficits. The pound's external value is also severely weak; how can it withstand the pressure from rising gold prices?</p>
<p>Now, British Chancellor Simon has asked Congress to revalue the Bank of England's reserve value and decided to estimate it once a week based on the market price. The proceeds from the valuation will be used as a foreign exchange fund. As for the bank's banknote issuance, he has requested that it be reduced from 400 million pounds to 300 million pounds and fixed at this amount, without increases or decreases.</p>
<p>This measure is a major revolution in the British monetary system. The Bank of England's reserves have been legally valued at 85 shillings per ounce for more than 200 years and have never changed. Now, not only is this legal price being abandoned, but it is also being estimated once based on the market price. Therefore, the higher the price of gold, the greater the value of the British reserves or foreign exchange fund. Of course, this can make the pound's position more solid. The London Times called this method the "market price gold standard," which will become a brand new term in modern monetary science.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Bank of England's banknote issuance has increased or decreased depending on the amount of cash reserves. If the amount of reserves is estimated based on the market price, the issuance of banknotes will inevitably increase today with rising gold prices. With increased banknote issuance, gold prices will naturally be affected by the increase in currency and rise. Therefore, it has now been decided that the total amount of banknote issuance shall not exceed 300 million pounds. Thus, the total amount of issuance has become fixed, and the amount of issuance reserves is transferred due to the market price. This is exactly the opposite of before. This is truly a new revolution for the pound.</p>
<p>What impact will this revolution have on gold prices and the pound exchange rate in the future? In our view, it can generally stabilize soaring gold prices and weak pound exchange rates for a while.</p>
<p>Because the Bank of England's banknote issuance has been reduced to 300 million pounds, it can first benefit from contracting the currency, making the pound firmer and restricting gold prices. Furthermore, revaluation directly strengthens the foreign exchange fund and indirectly enhances the UK's financial credit, so the pound's position can naturally be expected to improve. Therefore, people who buy gold out of suspicion of the pound can be reduced, and the speculative fever in the gold market can of course also be reduced. Therefore, the London gold market should be able to stabilize temporarily.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Securities: Unified Class A Leads Strongly, China Bookstore and China Merchants Electric, No One Willing to Sell at the Bid Price <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The securities gray market remained extremely firm yesterday. Although there were fluctuations in the middle, the bulls ultimately prevailed. This price increase was due to the authorities using facts to dispel rumors, and also due to an increase of ten in the number of Class A lottery tickets, totaling 24. When the rumors were rampant, they forgot where their benefits lay, and when the rumors subsided, they were startled and rushed in. Therefore, the price increase of Class A was particularly strong, and other types also soared accordingly, and the trend should be firm.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the initial opening, retail investors, Hengdehao, and Tianshenghao bought successively and gradually raised prices. Xie Dahao and No. 11 sold in the middle, causing a slight setback, but Class A remained firm as ever. As a result of the half-day, the price continued to rise by several jiao to more than one yuan. Trading was relatively weak in the afternoon. No. 11 and Xie Dahao suddenly covered their short positions, and Xinfengyong and retail investors also bought. The market continued to be firm. Only Tongkanghao, Dafenghao, and No. 5 slightly divested in the market. Class C and Class E saw the most trading for the day, Class A's price was the loosest, and Class D saw no trading. As a result, prices unanimously continued to rise by 6 jiao to 1.25 yuan, with a total trading volume of approximately 500,000 to 600,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading remained lackluster. China Bookstore shares were bid at 24.1 yuan, and China Merchants Electric shares were bid at 5 yuan, but there were no sellers.</p>
<p>London's listed prices for Chinese foreign debt on the 2nd of this month (Thursday) improved slightly, but market sentiment remained weak. Senior debt, English gold liquidation bonds, English issued debt notes, and Clipper bonds each rose by half a pound, with the former priced at 47 pounds and the latter at 33.5 pounds. English-German continued loans and English issued debt notes fell by half a pound to a price of 69.5 pounds. Junior railway bonds saw very little change. German-issued with imprint debt notes for the Hukuang Railway rose by 2 pounds to 22 pounds. Longhai Railway bonds rose by half a pound to 13 pounds. The rest were flat. The supply of physical goods in England was still not quiet. 5,000 pounds (equivalent to 25,000 US dollars) of Sino-French-American 5% bonds were sold at 68 pounds, at a parallel market price. 2,000 pounds of English gold liquidation bonds with German imprint debt notes were sold at 43.5 pounds, a drop of 15 shillings from the previous day. 2,000 pounds of Russian issued with imprint debt notes were sold at 42.5 pounds, which had not been opened for a long time and could not be compared. 5,000 pounds of Hukuang Railway bonds without German imprint debt notes were sold at 22 pounds and 5 shillings, a raise of 5 shillings on the market. 1,500 pounds of German issued with imprint lottery tickets were sold at 20.5 pounds, a drop of 1.5 pounds on the market. 1,000 pounds each of Tianjin-Pukou Railway original bonds with German imprint debt notes and German imprint lottery tickets, and 3,000 pounds of continued issued bonds with German imprint debt notes, were sold at 16.5 pounds, a raise of half a pound on the market. 2,000 pounds of Guangdong-Kowloon Railway bonds were sold at 18 pounds and 5 shillings, a slight raise of 5 shillings on the market.</p>
<p>London's listed prices for English East Asian company shares on the 2nd of this month (Thursday) saw mixed ups and downs. Mercantile Bank shares rose by 2 shillings and 6 pence to 9 pounds and 5 shillings. HSBC Hong Kong registered shares fell by half a pound to 86 pounds. Kailuan Mining unregistered shares rose by 3 pence to 16 shillings and 9 pence. Gula Keling Bangdi leather shares rose by 7.5 pence to 19 shillings and 4.5 pence. The rest were flat. The supply of physical goods in England was said to include the sale of 3,000 pounds of Australian Mining Bureau 6% English gold debt notes.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Grain: Flour and Wheat Supply and Demand Both Low, Already Showing Signs of Year's End <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>The flour market continued to be firm and stable. Transactions remained low. Northern firms have recently started selling lower-grade flour, but demand for #2 flour remains weak. This is because the supply of foreign flour from Tianjin is constant, so large firms cannot expand their sales. Southern firms are also only adding small amounts based on ship locations. A total of more than 20,000 bags were transacted in the market, still sold in small quantities by local and Northern-Southern firms. The price of #2 flour from cars and ships held at 4.8 yuan. There were no transactions for medium-grade and mixed brands. Today, there are 2,500 bags of flour being transported to Weihaiwei, 4,500 bags to Yantai, and 6,500 bags to the Tianjin area.</p>
<p>The wheat market remained quiet. Due to the approaching Lunar New Year, there were fewer vendors from various sources, and most trading was expected after the Lunar New Year. Purchases by various factories were also very sparse, and the market was even quieter. A total of 4,000 bags of wheat from Jiangbei Wuhu were sold in the market, with the Fuxin and Fushuang factories each buying half. The highest price was 6.55 yuan. The market already shows signs of winding down.</p>
<h3 id="e60">Ke Xian Du Rice Slight Drops <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>Ke Xian rice has been arriving continuously in recent days. Both car and boat routes have only had small batches arriving. Among them, 1,150 bags came from Hupu, replenishing the bottom stock. The exit route has long lacked large firms and buyers, relying only on local small batches, which is difficult to sustain for long. Therefore, the prices of high-quality goods unanimously weakened by 0.05-0.06 yuan yesterday. High-quality Jing Xian was only 10.075 yuan, large market Wu Xian was 10.03-0.04 yuan, and medium-quality prices varied. A total of more than 800 bags were transacted in the market.</p>
<p>With sales of domestic rice sluggish, buyers want to lower prices, which seems to be declining. Extended to the evening market, seeing that river goods had not arrived and there were only more than 4,000 bags by car and boat, sentiment turned firmer. Sellers were holding on firmly, and the market turned stable. However, the prices of various goods varied due to different thoughts of the sellers. Chang Xieng geng depreciated by 0.05 yuan, and Su Tong geng held the original price, while some depreciated by 0.02-0.03 yuan. Bo Cheng depreciated by 0.1 yuan due to limited exit routes. Du Yang and Jian Bu Jian were also not consistently weak. With supply and demand approximately equal, no significant changes were seen.</p>

<p>Miscellaneous grains have entered the closing phase and there will probably be no major changes within the year. Yesterday's market was even more desolate. A total of 300 bags of Chongming sand yellow and more than 100 bags of Wuhu beans were transacted in the market. Other than that, there were only more than 300 bags of cowpea transacted the night before. The market sentiment for red beans was down 0.03-0.04 yuan compared to the previous market, because arrivals were surging and sales were slack. Currently, Ben Niu goods opened at 9.2 yuan, Jiangbei goods at 7.02 yuan, and Nanjing goods at 6.63 yuan. The exit route was Guangshan and Liangbang.</p>

<p>Foreign silk markets are in a surge. Yesterday, Lyon market prices rose uniformly across all categories. Japanese silk rose 2 francs, Shanghai silk A rose 1 franc, B rose 2 francs, Guangdong silk rose 1 franc, Yokohama spot prices retreated slightly by 7 yuan, forward contracts rose 1 yuan, New York Japanese silk and Chinese silk rose 0.01 to 0.02 yuan, exchange recent rise of 0.02 yuan, the forward contract was the original plate of the previous day,</p>
<p>The Shanghai silk market is in high spirits. Buyers and factory silk market sentiment changed from firm to stagnant. Foreign firms were looking for 7/8 White factories to start sending messages to sell and collect, and manufacturers asked for 1,500 yuan. They want to see the situation of the foreign market today and predict that the domestic and foreign market prices must be at least 50-60 yuan apart. Users' market situation, hoarders, and silk mills have shifted their target to Ji Bi Jing, because Ji Li Jing market prices have not yet risen to the extreme point. Yesterday, I heard that Qilin Racecourse Ji Li Silk, yesterday, users made 870 yuan, which is a huge increase of 50 yuan. Looking at the silk prices in recent times, taking White Factory B as the standard, it has risen by 900 yuan compared with the lowest price after August 13.</p>

<p>Silkworm Industry</p>
<h3 id="e65">Why Have Recent Silk Prices Risen Excessively? <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— (Xiao He)</p>
<p>In the past two weeks, domestic and foreign silk prices have been reporting increases in both the East and West, as if the golden age of the silk industry has reappeared today due to the baptism of artillery fire. As a result, optimistic air has muddled people's minds, creating a distorted domestic demand in the last few weeks' external sales of "door can Luoque". What is expressed in silk prices is the hundred yuan difference between domestic and foreign silk prices, and what is expressed in sales is that the way out for raw silk is to invest in the arms of hoarders. As a result, this major export that adjusts international trade has not only lost the possibility of earning foreign exchange, but also made the raw material costs for silk weaving factories that operate miserably on the isolated island after the war heavier. There is no doubt that it is digging many traps that can destroy itself for the silk industry itself. However, what is the reason that silk prices have risen so excessively? This can be explained from two aspects.</p>
<p>First, let's take a look at the recent situation in the world silk market.</p>
<p>Japan, which accounts for more than 70% of the world's silk production, had a 12.5% reduction in raw silk production last year in the "national crisis" of its aggressive war. This year, when the second phase of the war of resistance is launched, undoubtedly, it will inevitably show further dryness and depression in any department within the country. This point guarantees that this year's world silk market will be affected by the lack of raw materials.</p>
<p>The second point is that because Japan reduced silkworm rearing last year, the existing cocoons could not connect to the new cocoons produced. As a result, some Japanese silk factories switched to making fine striped silk products to delay the day, which caused a surplus of 13-15 striped raw silk in the United States or the Japanese mainland, and an insufficient supply of 20-22 striped raw silk. This has made the price of 20-22 striped silk surpass the price of fine striped silk in the market, which has promoted the abnormal development of silk prices in the world's major raw silk markets. (According to the Reuters report on raw silk market prices, in recent weeks, the price of 20-22 striped silk has been 0.01-0.03 yuan higher than the price of 13-15 striped silk, which can confirm this statement.)</p>
<p>The third point is the export of high-quality dry cocoons and the use of low-quality dry cocoons as wool substitutes to weave military uniforms, etc. under the reduction of cocoon collection in Japan. The former is due to the need for raw materials from German silk factories and the Japanese demand for German-made aggressive munitions. The second part is that Japan plans to save wool to save its dwindling foreign exchange. As a result, a double raw material shortage was created, which directly stimulated the flying purchase of international silk prices. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Yarn Flowers: Banks Purchase Yarn and Transport It South for Sale, Present Yarn Market Returns to Good Condition, Japanese Yarn Also Sees Purchases for Speculation <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market's rise is slow. Forwarders and small investors are not interested in stocking up for the New Year, to avoid capital pressure. Market prices are slightly better, with goods being released based on market prices. However, banks in this port have recently not stopped purchasing cotton textiles and are buying spot goods for transport to and sale in Huainan, coastal defense areas, and Kunming, etc., where the profits are relatively high. This has further stirred market confidence. At the same time, although other trading groups do not show signs of bulk wholesale expansion, sporadic transactions are also more active than in the past few days, so market prices have turned for the better.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened this morning with telegrams from customers in other provinces requesting goods from Shanghai, so market sentiment was particularly high. 20-count Double Horse yarn opened at an additional 2.5 yuan, at 397 yuan. The Fujian group bought 45 bales, and soon there were more sellers, dropping back by 1.5 yuan. Financial institutions continued to buy, recovering the price. The inland groups showed interest in yarn of heavy weight, with 280 bales of 20-count Special Jincheng brand being purchased. At closing, small investors sold, falling back by 1 yuan. Double Horse was at 396 yuan. The morning's transaction volume totaled 981 bales, with inter-dealer transactions still accounting for half. The price of 20-count Double Horse was 1.5 yuan higher than the previous day, Special Jincheng rose 5 yuan, Double Globe rose 4 yuan, Heavenly Girl rose 2.5 yuan, Shepherd rose 1.5 yuan, 18-count Heavenly Girl rose 3 yuan, and 10-count coarse yarn also rose 2-3 yuan. The Yong'an Factory opened 280 bales of 20-count Special Jincheng at prices from 395 yuan to 398 yuan. Inland groups took it. Spot sales and exports included 150 pieces transported to Ningbo. The market breakdown is listed below:</p>
<p>Inland 280  Dealers 475</p>
<p>Fujian 40 Shantou 51</p>
<p>Ningbo 20 Yunnan 25</p>
<p>Jiangxi 50 Xiamen 20</p>
<p>Hong Kong 20 Total 981</p>
<p>Although the Japanese yarn market is light on transactions, the consecutive days of sharp declines have prompted a major yarn firm to buy in and speculate, so market prices have rebounded by 4-5 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn is 321 yuan to 325 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn is 316 yuan to 320 yuan. However, due to the squeezing experienced last month, everyone is wary of next month's "ball skin" business and no one dares to do it at present.</p>
<h3 id="e67">American Cotton Sees Mixed Price Fluctuations, Local Transactions Are Virtually Stalled <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>The price of foreign cotton in New York initially rose due to purchases by dealers, then fell due to hedging sales in the South and selling in New Orleans. Washington has not made any progress, and because everyone is taking a wait-and-see attitude, the market is increasingly sluggish. Yesterday in New York, prices rose and fell. The Indian market was quiet, with forecasts unchanged. The Egyptian cotton market fell 5-6 pound sounds. Exchange rates were still weak yesterday, and converted into legal tender, cotton prices all rose, with American cotton and Brazilian cotton rising 2 jiao per dan, Indian cotton rising 1 jiao, and Egyptian cotton also rising 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton transactions in Shanghai are quite quiet. Recently, due to the approaching end of the year and sluggish sales of yarn and cloth, a large batch of foreign cotton ordered by various factories has arrived in Shanghai in recent days. Moreover, ordering foreign cotton requires a 20% deposit. All Chinese factories do not plan to order during the lunar new year, so foreign cotton transactions must wait until the lunar new year. Yesterday's transactions were silent. The prices of foreign cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Converted Market Prices</p>
<p>Local cotton business is becoming more and more depressed, due to seasonal factors. The lunar new year closing period is approaching, and all parties are busy with closing operations and are in a relaxed state. Transactions are becoming scarce. Since factories have ordered Indian and American cotton in large quantities, their intake of local cotton is very narrow. Therefore, market prices have recently been somewhat weak. The only robust supply is from northern Jiangsu. 1,220 bales of Tonghua arrived, 1,240 pieces from Funing, 450 pieces from Beisha, and 250 pieces from Baimao Qiya. The market situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday, only the local street slightly added to the purchases of Dongpi fine cloth and fine twill, with transactions of less than 300 pieces. The Tianjin group was disinterested and had no appetite. Major dealers were in high spirits, not without the intention to loosen sales, and there were those who were discreetly absorbing goods. However, ordinary brokers who only enter and exit the market have no capital to support and are reducing prices to sell. Therefore, the spot market price of fine cloth and fine twill has fallen by about 5 fen per piece. The prices of colored goods such as Four Gentlemen and Zhigong have risen due to shortages, and they are now selling for 4 jiao per yard, and serge for 3 jiao 9 and a half fen.</p>
<p>Today, 470 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin, 420 pieces to Shanghai-Yantai, 50 pieces to Weihaiwei, and 520 pieces to Ningbo.</p>
<h3 id="e68">Miscellaneous: Tin Foil Origin Prices High <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Since entering the peak season, the selling price of tin foil has remained at the original level due to ample supply. Recently, due to increased raw material and labor costs in the production area, the wholesale price in the production area has been steadily raised. Moreover, wholesale prices in other ports have also continued to rise. Because the sales in this city are active, the industry has decided to increase the price by 1 jiao per strip and 4 fen per piece in order to maintain costs, and sales started at the new price the day before yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e69">Metals: A Large Batch of Metal Orders Placed <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>Recently, metal transactions have been relatively active. The inventory in this port has been almost exhausted. Spot goods such as thick gauge white lead, eighteen gauge black iron sheet, 36-inch Yellow Eagle brand, Da Guangpi, Dutch tin, thin iron, 100-pound tinplate, green lead, iron, small patterned bamboo steel bars, etc. are all in short supply. Dealers are placing orders for futures from overseas, so a large batch has been ordered in recent days.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Piece Goods: Profits Expected After the New Year, Hoarders Continue to Search for Cheap Goods, Tianjin Group Is Disinterested in Dongpi <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>Domestic cloth sales are more active in Kunming, Shantou, and Quanzhou. There are still small purchases in Zhejiang, Jiangxi, northern Jiangsu, and inland areas. Local hoarders in this city continue to search for cheap goods, mostly believing that buying at bargain prices now will bring profits after the New Year. However, second-hand goods are not sold cheaply because factories are asking high prices for February futures. They hold out against each other, and the market is generally stable. The Shantou group purchased 60-70 packages of 12-pound and 11-pound fine cloth from underwear factories, and nearly 100 pieces of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and printed cloth. The Sichuan group purchased 800 pieces of colored cloth and foreign yarn. The Yunnan group continued to purchase more than 50 boxes of colored cloth, printed cloth, satin, Zhigong, hemp yarn, and bleached cloth. The Wen and Yong groups only made sporadic additions, about 100 pieces of colored cloth, factory cloth, coarse cloth, and twill. Northern Jiangsu and inland Zhejiang and Jiangxi purchased several thousand pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, serge, line tweed, bleached cloth, poplin, and patterned goods in small quantities from wholesale dealers in this city. The Hong Kong group and local merchants purchased 60-70 pieces of dyed greige fine twill. The Min group purchased more than 100 boxes of serge, line tweed, colored cloth, and colored twill. Small Luzon and Singapore continued to purchase goods.</p>

<p>The Continental Daily reports that the Japanese authorities in this port announced yesterday (2nd) that 65 foreigners in Kuling will have to find a way to leave the mountain within a week. We reap what we sow. The Japanese side has submitted the notification regarding this move to the consular authorities in this port. However, according to the Japanese side's statement at a reception for reporters last night, they have not yet received a reply. The deadline for foreigners to leave Kuling has been set by the Japanese army as</p>
<p>February 10. Furthermore, according to the Japanese military spokesman, foreigners must notify the Japanese military authorities of the date and time of their departure before leaving the area. More importantly, foreigners must depart during the day and travel in groups. Those who do not travel in groups will face significant danger. The spokesman further explained in response to a reporter's question that because the Japanese army's methods of resisting guerrillas</p>
<p>will become more intense, there is significant danger. It is said that there are 4,000-5,000 Chinese troops around the mountain. A reporter asked if his answer meant that after the evacuation of the foreigners, indiscriminate bombing would be carried out. The spokesman replied that they would do their best to avoid damaging foreign property, but if the Chinese army occupies the buildings after the evacuation of the foreigners, the "responsibility will be borne by Chongqing." A reporter asked</p>
<p>whether foreigners should not open their residences after evacuation, so that they would not be possibly occupied by the army and damaged. The spokesman replied that evacuating foreigners would protect their lives, because foreign property is clearly marked with national flags and the location of their property has been notified to the Japanese side. There is no reason for it to be damaged in combat. The spokesman further stated that the Chinese army had previously used foreign property for military purposes.</p>
<p>The Japanese side had obtained information that Chinese guerrillas in the Lushan area used the houses of evacuated foreigners as barracks. The Japanese Navy intends to provide evacuated foreigners with transportation to Jiujiang, but this cannot be stated definitively yet because the date of departure has not been determined. This matter must be decided by the foreigners in Kuling themselves. Considerable consideration will be given to the transportation of sick foreigners, but if there are sick foreigners who</p>
<p>cannot move, then he cannot say what steps the Japanese side will take. A reporter asked if the Japanese authorities would consider setting up a neutral zone around Kuling so that foreigners would not have to evacuate. The spokesman replied that this was a hypothetical question. After the area is pacified, it will be in the same situation as other Japanese-occupied areas. "Once peace and order are fully restored," residents will be allowed to return to Kuling. Currently, there are</p>
<p>65 foreigners still remaining in Kuling, including 37 British, 12 Americans, and 9 Germans. The rest are from other countries. Most have lived in Kuling for a very long time. Shanghai expressed panic yesterday, because if they have to evacuate, they will lose most of their property, furniture, and other belongings. It was previously known that several sick foreigners were still living in Kuling, but no recent information has been obtained about their condition.</p>
<p>If there are those who are seriously ill and cannot move, a serious situation will arise. It was heard last night that the British and American consulates had submitted the Japanese side's ultimatum to the Hankou office, because Kuling is within the jurisdiction of that office. The Hankou office will notify the Japanese authorities in Shanghai after deciding on a plan.</p>
<h3 id="e72">Shanghai Stores 700,000 Bags of Rice, Food Supply Is Secure, Smuggling of National Rice for Export Is Rampant <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association is doing its best to smooth the supply and stabilize market prices in order to regulate the food supply for Shanghai residents. Now the national rice produced in the Changshu, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Songjiang, Qingpu, and Hupu rice producing areas has been purchased in large quantities by the Japanese side and smuggled to North China and the Guandong area. The total amount has exceeded 1 million dan, causing the stockpiles in the producing areas to gradually thin out and the prices to rise, affecting the entire food supply. A reporter from the New Sound Society learned from the market yesterday that since Shanghai banned the re-export of national rice, merchants from North China have colluded with the Japanese to directly purchase from the producing areas and transport it to the Hongkou district of Shanghai by small steamships and then load it onto Japanese ships for transport north. However, under the special circumstances in Shanghai, suppression is difficult. If this continues, it will inevitably affect the food supply in Shanghai. As for the current rice reserves in Shanghai, including the warehouses of various banks and rice dealers, the total is 700,000 bags, each bag containing one shi and two and a half dou, enough to supply Shanghai's food needs for two and a half months. Moreover, the rice boats arriving from the river and those transported by small steamships or trains are sufficient to meet the daily consumption of the people of Shanghai. Therefore, there is no fear of a shortage of food in Shanghai for the time being. There may be a fear of shortage during the transition period, but because Shanghai's transportation is convenient, foreign rice can be telegraphed in if necessary. However, there is deep concern that rice prices will rise in the future. Although the Shanghai rice market limits the maximum price to no more than 14 yuan per shi in national currency, the current wholesale price of the top grade is 12 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>

<p>On the seventh anniversary of the "January 28th" incident this year, the City Party Headquarters and various organizations of this city telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, expressing their absolute support for the government's national policy of resisting Japan to the end and their efforts to collect donations for the festival. The situation of the charity sale and donation collection has received a reply from the chairman, offering comfort and encouragement, which is recorded as follows: The City Party Headquarters forwarded the telegram to various organizations. Having learned of your unwavering determination and unity, I am extremely gratified. Now the victory of the War of Resistance is more assured. Shanghai is tied to the perceptions of China and foreign countries. I deeply hope that you will contribute and dedicate your efforts to enhance your performance, promote our national spirit, and make contributions to aid the war. This is what I deeply hope for.

<h3 id="e74">The Japanese Side Again Instigates Puppets, Manufacturing a Peace Movement, Representatives of North and South Puppet Organizations Meet in Nanjing, The Japanese Side's Exhaustion and Inability to Continue the War Is Evident <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Recently, because the Japanese side is deeply mired in the war against China and feels unable to extricate itself, its desire for peace is extremely urgent. It had previously attempted to promote peace talks led by Wang Jingwei, but was severely rejected by the central authorities and unanimously condemned by the people of the whole country, resulting in failure and complete disillusionment. As a result, the Japanese side is anxious and distressed, its plans exhausted and weaknesses increasingly exposed. Therefore, it tried every means to win over Wu Peifu, urging him to come out of retirement and giving him the position of "Chairman of the Pacification Committee," hoping that Wu would carry out the peace movement. However, Wu, aware of the treacherous scheme, was unmoved, while the Japanese side actually sang and acted on its own, creating an atmosphere and confusing people. At the same time, the puppets in the North and South puppet governments and the Central China and South China puppet organizations, in order to please their "masters," also ran around shouting and begging for peace, and decided to convene a "joint meeting" in Nanjing yesterday. It is calculated that Wang Kemin, Wang Yitang, etc. attended from North China, Chen Zhongfu attended on behalf of Central China, Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, etc. from "Vichy," and a Peng official, the president of the fake "Guangzhou Autonomous Association" attended from South China. The fake "Shanghai Municipal Government" sent Wang Changchun to attend. According to sources, the content of the meeting will discuss the establishment of political sub-associations in various places and earnestly urge Wu Peifu to come out of retirement to lead the "Peace and National Salvation Movement." The donkey's tricks are exhausted, which is evident here.</p>
<h3 id="e75">Foreign Media Report That the Japanese Side Is Trying to Entice Wu Peifu to Take the Stage, Planning to Give Him Troops to Rule South of the Yellow River, Wu Has Decided Not to Be Moved by the Unilateral Plan <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that yesterday afternoon (2nd), reliable Chinese sources in this port stated that representatives of the Japanese government are prepared to hand over all Japanese-occupied areas south of the Yellow River to Wu Peifu for "management," and provide him with troops so that he has the power to "manage." It is said that the Japanese authorities made this new plan to withdraw Japanese troops to fight in the north. Once Wu's "troops" are formed, and at least when they have overcome local opposition and are sufficient to maintain his power, the main force of the Japanese army will withdraw. However, this port believes that the claim that the Japanese army will completely withdraw from south of the Yellow River is unlikely. The "troops" in the plan will likely have "advisors" appointed by the Japanese side in major positions. In addition to providing funding initially, the Japanese side may allocate several aircraft for Wu to dispatch to carry out his "peace movement." It is also possible. Translator's note: This is a plan on the Japanese side, and there is no confirmation on whether Wu Peifu will accept it.</p>
<p>According to another report, since the outbreak of the Japanese army's war of aggression against China, the Japanese army has suffered numerous casualties, and its domestic economy is on the verge of collapse. Therefore, it is eager for peace and attempts to create a peace in its favor under the current situation. After the previous Wang Jingwei's betrayal and seeking peace, the Japanese side extensively promoted it in the occupied areas, attempting to deceive the people in the war zone. In recent days, it has also distributed communiques drafted by the Japanese side, not issued by Wu Peifu himself, in the vicinity of Shanghai, attempting to ease the anti-Japanese actions of the people's guerrillas.</p>
<h3 id="e76">Yu Qiaqing Telegrams the Ministry, Begging to Allow Zhejiang Cotton to Be Transported to Shanghai, To Be Certified by the Chinese Merchants Yarn Factory Joint Association, Clearing Congested Cotton to Rescue Cotton Farmers and Merchants <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing telegrams the Ministries of Finance and Economy, requesting that Zhejiang cotton be allowed to be transported to Shanghai for sale. He respectfully presents to Minister of Finance Kong and Minister of Economy Weng: According to a telegram from the Ning Shao Area Cotton Transport and Sales Office, the Zhejiang Customs ban on cotton transport to Shanghai was issued in accordance with Finance Ministry Guan Yu Zi No. 5368 telegram, approving the Economy Ministry Xian telegram, requesting that the Customs ban the transport of 54 types of goods to aid the enemy. After a detailed investigation, the prohibited areas mentioned in the Xian telegram should be published by various government agencies and checkpoints in areas that have been known to be controlled by the Japanese through violence before they are designated. The Yong cotton transported to Shanghai enters the public concession, where there are many Chinese merchant yarn factories, and the need is pressing. Moreover, it cannot be controlled by the violence of the Japanese, so it cannot be designated as a prohibited area. Furthermore, according to the Ministry of Finance's plan to promote domestic goods, it has approved the exemption of foreign exchange settlement for 16 categories, including cotton, which is sufficient to prove that Shanghai is not a prohibited area. Moreover, in accordance with the main purpose of the ban, care should be taken to prevent aiding the enemy. Yong cotton is used for spinning coarse yarn and is only needed by Chinese merchant yarn factories. When going to Yong to purchase, permission should first be obtained from Shanghai Fuhua Company, and the Yarn Factory Joint Association should issue a certificate. Upon export, it is strictly inspected by the competent government agency. After being transported to Shanghai, it is verified by the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance and the Zhejiang Provincial Material Adjustment Office, both stationed in Hong Kong, and the procedures are complete, with no suspicion of aiding the enemy. At present, there is congestion of cotton, totaling 240,000 bales in Yong and inland, worth 10 million yuan in national currency. Once the ban is imposed, cotton farmers and merchants will suffer together. How can it be imagined? We earnestly request that the department show compassion and urgently telegram the Zhejiang Customs to allow transport as before, in order to save farmers and merchants, etc. What was stated by He De is true, and because of his relationship with his hometown, he knows that cotton farmers and merchants are in urgent need of transport. If it is prohibited, their livelihood will be cut off, and the danger is worthy of concern. Therefore, he dares to report the situation to the highest level, hoping that the higher authorities will show compassion and quickly order the Zhejiang Customs to investigate the actual situation and allow the existing cotton in Yong to be transported to Shanghai in order to save farmers and merchants and avoid suffering. He is infinitely grateful and hopes for this to the utmost. Yu He De bows.</p>

<p>The streets south of the Suzhou River are extremely crowded, and there are a large number of refugees who are new to Shanghai and do not understand traffic conditions. This is the reason for the increase in fatal accidents. Of the above-mentioned deaths, 134 died in the Central and Western districts, and the rest died in the Northeast districts. (End)</p>

<p>The small steamer Zizaiwen outside of Wenzhou sunk after a hanging board broke. The ship has not yet been salvaged. Regarding the location of the wreck, the Jiang Customs has been reported by the Zhen Customs to be surveyed. The coordinates are at 28 degrees 16 minutes north latitude and 121 degrees 28 minutes and 5 seconds east longitude.

<p>In view of the fact that since the War of Resistance, there have been many intellectual youths in various places who have participated in the anti-Japanese work in the front or rear, and there are also not a few who are still scattered in various places because they are limited by the environment and cannot work. In order to find ways to maintain their livelihoods and increase the strength of the War of Resistance, the Central Party Headquarters has ordered the anti-Japanese and defense associations in each province to conduct registration of intellectual youths. All those who have graduated from junior high school or above or have equivalent academic qualifications, are physically healthy, have no bad habits, believe in the Three Principles of the People, obey the leader, and have the determination to sacrifice for the War of Resistance may participate in the registration. Then, the anti-Japanese and defense association will conduct a qualification examination, provide appropriate training, and then assign them work. After receiving the order, the anti-Japanese and defense associations in each province have entrusted the party and government organs of each province to be responsible for the registration.</p>

<h3 id="e80">The "Haidar" Returned to Shanghai Yesterday; Norwegian Consul Prepares Report; Ship Captains Detail Detention Experience; Founing Shipping Route Forced to be Cut Off <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The "Haidar," "Yungzhen," and "Hafa" vessels, on the 28th of last month, were unloading cargo at Hexing Town in Founing when sudden Japanese aircraft appeared and bombed the area. They fled to Yanghekou, but unexpectedly encountered a Japanese warship outside the port and were detained, then forced to sail to Qingdao. After negotiations by British and Norwegian consuls, and the arrival of British warships in Qingdao for rescue, the Japanese side successively released the vessels. The "Yungzhen" and "Hafa" ships returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday, and the "Haidar" also arrived at 5:00 PM yesterday. Upon arrival, the ship reported the detention experience to the company. It was also reported that over two thousand four hundred and fifty pieces of cargo previously shipped to Founing remained unloaded and were brought back on the original ship, along with one thousand two hundred and forty-eight bales of cotton, over one hundred and sixty salted pigs, and over sixty pieces of sundry goods loaded there.</p>
<p>The "Continental Daily" reports that the British ship "Yungzhen" was detained by a Japanese warship and a "Customs" patrol vessel. British authorities are currently conducting a formal investigation. The Norwegian Consulate General is also starting a similar investigation (on the 2nd) regarding the simultaneous detention of the "Hafa" vessel. The "Hafa" vessel arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon, docking at floating docks number 25 and 26. The ship's captain, Anderson, immediately went to the Norwegian Consulate General to report the experience in detail and had a lengthy discussion with consulate officials. It was heard yesterday at dusk that the Norwegian Consulate was working on preparing a report, but it had not yet been completed at that time.</p>
<p>"Modern News" reports that cargo transportation on the Shanghai-Founing route has been extremely prosperous. Since the Japanese aircraft bombed Hexing Town on the 26th of last month and the Japanese warships illegally detained three foreign vessels, including the "Yungzhen," shipping on this route has been suspended. Now, after negotiations, the British "Yungzhen" vessel has been released and, upon returning to Shanghai from Qingdao, has decided to switch to the Tianjin route within days. Furthermore, the Norwegian "Hafa" vessel of the Fucheng Company, after returning to Shanghai from Qingdao the day before yesterday, originally intended to resume the Shanghai-Founing route, but due to passenger unwillingness to risk it, it has decided to sail to Fuzhou today or tomorrow. As for the British Kailin Malu vessel, which originally intended to test the Founing route, it now also sees that the situation there is unstable, and that navigation markers at Yanghekou have been removed by guerrillas, making navigation highly dangerous, and therefore has to temporarily abandon the route. In addition, the Norwegian "Haidar" vessel of the Subei Company, released from Qingdao and returned to Shanghai, arrived at the port yesterday and also plans to switch to another route. Therefore, the Founing route is now at a standstill.</p>

<p>The English "North China Daily News" reports that there are continuing and increasingly visible signs of taxpayers opposing the salary increases for senior officials at the Municipal Council. A reader sent a letter to the newspaper, believing that taxpayers may refuse to pay taxes. Another letter stated that the salary increase funds could be used to support the Salvation Army. Two detectives from the police department suggested that if senior officials donate their salary increases to charity, they would be willing to donate their recent salary increases to assist the International Relief Committee. Meanwhile, the Committee of Businessmen's Representatives remains busy with its unappreciated work. The Municipal Council has scheduled a meeting for next Wednesday, at which time everything may be decided. Furthermore, Japanese newspapers recently reported that the Deputy Chief of Police, Akagi, would distribute his salary increase to low-ranking Japanese personnel in the police department. When the reporter asked Akagi about this, he replied that this must be someone else's suggestion, as he himself had not made this suggestion, and that this action would be ridiculous. Because if his salary increase were distributed, each low-ranking Japanese personnel would only receive slightly more than one yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Chinese-Owned Textile Mills in War Zones Refuse to Cooperate and Are Plundered by the Japanese; Japanese Monopolize Sales of Yarn and Cloth in Occupied Areas; Cotton in North and Central China Under Japanese Control <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Chinese-owned textile mills are mostly concentrated in a few coastal cities and have been severely impacted by the war. Mills in the war zones have refused to cooperate and have been plundered, with machinery being moved without permission. Goods produced by Chinese-owned mills in the concessions rely entirely on consumption in the southwestern provinces. The sale of yarn in Japanese occupied areas is monopolized by the Japanese, and the sales of cotton are also under their control. Detailed information is recorded below.</p>
<p>Thirty-Eight Textile Mills in Operation</p>
<p>Textile mills in Shanghai that are in operation: Chinese-owned - Shenxin No. 2 Textile Mill, Shenxin No. 9 Textile Mill, Xinyu No. 1 Mill, Xinyu No. 2 Mill, Hongzhang Textile Dyeing Mill, Yongan No. 3 Mill, Tongyi Textile Company, Qinfeng Textile Mill, Datong Yarn Mill Co., Ltd., and Heji Zhengye Yarn Mill, totaling ten mills with 354,270 spindles, 31,360 thread spindles, and 1,700 looms, accounting for 32.3% of the original textile mills. British-owned - Jardine, Public, Yangshupu, and Lun Chang, totaling four mills with 40,976 spindles, 2,640 thread spindles, and 3,265 looms. Japanese-owned - Rihua, Shanghai, Naigaiwata, Donghua, Tongxing, Gongda, Dakang, Toyota, Yufeng, etc., totaling twenty-four mills with 1,114,316 spindles, 190,824 thread spindles, and 14,554 looms.</p>
<p>Consumption of Yarn Produced by Chinese, British, and Japanese Mills</p>
<p>Goods produced by Chinese, British, and Japanese mills: Chinese-owned mills rely entirely on consumption in the southwestern provinces. British-owned mills supply the British-owned weaving mills in this city. Japanese yarn is cheaper than Chinese and British yarn, and is supplied to weaving mills in this city for dumping in the occupied areas. Last November, the number of spot yarn transactions in Shanghai: 2,050 bales in Yunnan, 1,994 bales inland, 1,586 bales in Shantou, 1,315 bales in Tianjin, 219 bales in Ningbo, 350 bales from the Northern Gang, 394 bales in Fujian, 80 bales in Wenzhou, 52 bales in Quanzhou, 40 bales in Yantai, 40 bales in Sichuan, 85 bales in Jiangxi, 25 bales in Nanyang, 35 bales in Haiphong, 6,208 bales from fellow traders, and 10 bales in Suzhou, for a total of 14,483 bales.</p>
<p>Raw Materials Under Control, Prices Soar</p>
<p>The raw materials for all textile mills, namely cotton, were originally purchased from cotton-producing areas north of the Yangtze River and in North China. Now, because the above-mentioned areas have fallen one after another, the "North China Provisional Government" and the "Central China Reformed Government" are implementing controlled transportation and sales of cotton under the orders of the Japanese side. Therefore, Chinese-owned textile mills are finding it quite difficult to obtain the necessary raw materials. Although cotton production was abundant in various places last year, it was all controlled by the Japanese side and transported to Japan and the Kwantung Leased Territory, Korea, Taiwan, and other areas, with a total value of 89,897,717 yuan in national currency. Cotton prices, such as the average price of machine-picked cotton at 52.89 yuan last November, Lingbao cotton at 84.05 yuan on average, and Tianjin American cotton at 88.11 yuan on average, all three cottons have the highest price since 1932.</p>
<p>Plundering Chinese-Owned Textile Mills in War Zones</p>
<p>Regarding Chinese-owned textile mills in occupied areas, Japanese textile industry associations such as Naigaiwata, Shanghai, Rihua, Tongxing, and Gongda have taken over the management of the various Chinese mills, calling it "cooperation," attempting to plunder them. Because the conditions were too harsh, the mills refused to cooperate unanimously. The Japanese plan failed, so they simply plundered the machinery of the various mills and moved it to other locations, treating it as their own. For example, the Chinese mills in the war zones on the outskirts of Shanghai have mostly been destroyed by gunfire. Even those that have been spared have no possibility of recovery for the time being due to the internal machinery being moved away. In total, Hengfeng, Dafeng, Zhentai, Baoxing, Shanghai, and 17 other mills, with 760,136 spindles, 91,306 thread spindles, and 24,919 looms, account for 67.7% of the original textile mills.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Pulled Rickshaws to be Released Immediately <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The case of the pulled rickshaws of the members of the Shanghai Pulled Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association being detained by the Public Concession police due to their inability to modify the wheels has deeply concerned all sectors. The Chinese directors have been requesting the association to send representatives to petition. Especially after Jiang Yiping and Xi Yushu, the two Chinese directors, once visited the heads of the Transportation and Police Departments the day before yesterday to request the prior release of the detained rickshaws, a satisfactory resolution has not yet been reached. Yesterday morning, no less than a hundred detained rickshaw drivers gathered in front of the Mutual Aid Association on Guizhou Road to await news. Some even brought their wives and children, and their hunger and cold were quite pitiful. The association sent members to comfort them, and they gradually dispersed. It is now learned that Jiang and Xi, the two Chinese directors, once again visited the heads of the Transportation and Police Departments and the Deputy Director-General, Mr. He DeKui, yesterday afternoon, requesting that they have compassion for the hardships of the coolies' livelihoods and grant them accommodation by first releasing all the detained rickshaws. The Mutual Aid Association will be responsible for the military wheel modification matter, urging members to complete the modification by July 1 of this year, so that the livelihoods of the poor and the administrative policies of the Municipal Council can be taken into account. After the repeated mediation of Jiang and Xi, the two Chinese directors, it is heard that the Transportation Department has accepted the opinions of Jiang and Xi, the two Chinese directors, and the vehicles detained by each police station are expected to be released today. Starting next week, they will formally pay taxes and operate, but the Transportation Department still feels that the time is too long for the completion of wheel modification before July 1. It is hoped that the association can persuade its members to complete the modification according to the regulations of the Municipal Council as soon as possible to facilitate road administration.</p>

<p>The "Continental Daily" reports that, according to a survey by the Japanese Cabinet Statistics Bureau, living expenses in Tokyo increased last month. The level of living for Tokyo laborers, based on July 1937, had risen to 114.0 in January of this year, an increase of 1.1% compared to last December and an increase of 8.9% compared to the same month last year. The level of living for the salaried class was 112.8 last month, an increase of 1% compared to last December and an increase of 8% compared to the same month last year. Among the five categories of goods listed, the most significant increase was in food, which increased by 2% in January compared to December, clothing increased by 0.8%, "other" increased by 0.4%, housing consumption increased by 0.2%, and electricity and heating increased by 0.2%.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Clear Sound of Cannons Yesterday Afternoon; Guerrilla Activity Active on Both Banks of the Yangtze River; Japanese Army Helplessly Opens Fire <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" reports that, according to a report from the Jiaxing Road Police Station, heavy cannon fire was heard quite clearly in the northern district of Shanghai yesterday (the 2nd) from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM, lasting for more than half an hour. The public believes that this was Japanese warships in the Yangtze River opening fire on the Chinese guerrillas on both banks, hence the sound of cannon fire.</p>

<p>The British warship HMS Cardock has been in Shanghai for many days. The committee of the British St. David's Society in this city held a luncheon at the Shanghai Club on the 2nd to welcome the officers of the ship as a welcome reception. However, the ship's captain, Halfhyde, did not attend due to other engagements and was represented by the deputy captain, Mr. Alif. A welcome speech was given by Mr. Bryce, a member of the society, and then they wished each other good health. HMS Cardock is a well-known and highly regarded battleship in the British fleet and commanded the German fleet in 1918. It is heard that among the British expatriates who attended the banquet was Mr. Ham from the British Embassy.</p>
<p>British Army Commander in Shanghai, Major General Smollen, was transferred from Britain to Shanghai during the August 13th Shanghai battle. Since Smollen's transfer to Shanghai, he has worked hard to maintain the security of the concession during this time of war. It is learned that Smollen will be leaving Shanghai soon. The Municipal Council and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps held a banquet on the evening of the 1st at the Volunteer Corps Club to bid farewell to Smollen, expressing their gratitude for his efforts in maintaining the security of the Shanghai Concession. One hundred and fifty high-ranking officials from the Municipal Council and others attended at that time, and presented Smollen with a flag to express their thanks.</p>

The British warship HMS Gnat accompanied it. HMS Scarab will return here tomorrow (the 4th), but HMS Gnat is not coming to Shanghai at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Customs Prohibits Transportation of Various Native Goods; Ministry to Negotiate Purchase; Various Native Goods Businesses in Zhejiang Province Wire Requests to Transport to Shanghai; Authorities Deny Request Due to Special Circumstances of Jianghai Customs <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Following the orders of the Ministries of Economic Affairs and Finance, prohibiting 54 kinds of goods such as tung oil as aiding the enemy, the cotton and native paper industries in Zhejiang Province have wired requests for release. The Customs believes that Shanghai is an area controlled by Japanese violence and does not allow native goods to be transported to Shanghai for sale. The government has allocated funds to purchase and provide relief. Detailed information is recorded below.</p>
<p>Various Industries Wire to Request Permission to Transport to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Ning-Shao District Cotton Transportation and Sales Office, etc., stated that because cotton and other goods have been prohibited from being transported to Shanghai, the livelihoods of cotton farmers and cotton merchants have been cut off, requesting that the Zhejiang Customs be ordered to release the cotton stored in Ningbo Port for transportation to Shanghai in order to save farmers and merchants. To prevent aiding the enemy, the Chinese Textile Mill Association can issue a certificate, and after transportation to Shanghai, the Shanghai offices of the Zhejiang Province Produce Adjustment Office of the Ministry of Finance Trade Commission can verify it. Moreover, the Shanghai Concession is not an area controlled by Japanese violence and cannot be designated as a prohibited area.</p>
<p>Zhejiang Customs Unable to Accommodate</p>
<p>The Tax Commissioner of Zhejiang Customs issued a statement, saying that as for whether Shanghai should be considered a prohibited location, the Customs has no authority to consider it. As for the Customs' announcement on January 23, prohibiting the export of native goods, including paper, it was transferred to the Customs by the Inspector General of Customs under the order of the Ministry of Finance and cannot be modified or disregarded without authorization. Regarding the request to transport to Shanghai for sale, it is requested that the office directly request the Ministry of Finance to review and handle it. Now, the native paper industry and others have wired to the Ministries of Finance and Economic Affairs, requesting permission to transport to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Shanghai Temporarily Designated as a Prohibited Area</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has now conducted a detailed investigation into the prohibited areas controlled by Japanese violence, and is negotiating with relevant agencies to designate them. Before the designation by the Ministry of Economic Affairs, local authorities and customs offices in areas close to the war zones should first prohibit transportation in areas known to be controlled by Japanese violence. However, local customs offices believe that Shanghai is a fallen area. Therefore, before the Ministry of Economic Affairs designates it, all 54 kinds of native goods are prohibited from being transported to Shanghai. Currently, native goods in eastern Zhejiang and other places are being prevented from being transported to Shanghai for sale.</p>
<p>Government Purchases Goods Being Obstructed</p>
<p>After 54 kinds of native goods such as tung oil were prohibited from transportation, if they were the main products of the local area, and sales were obstructed, affecting the livelihoods of the people, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has established remedial measures, ordering each province to follow them. Each provincial government should investigate the sales and production situation and report to the Ministry at any time, or directly negotiate with the Ministry of Finance Trade Commission and the Agricultural Credit Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs to purchase them for relief. Now, tung oil in eastern Zhejiang is being purchased by the Central Trust of China, and tea is being purchased by the Fuhua Company of the Trade Commission.</p>
<p>Special Circumstances of Shanghai Customs</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Jianghai Customs deposited tax revenue in Japanese banks, revised tax rates on Japanese goods, and stopped remitting funds to the Inspector General of Customs since June of last year, the national government believes that if native goods are transported to Shanghai, unscrupulous merchants seeking petty profits will want to transship them for export. The government would then be unable to stop them.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Copper-Nickel Subsidiary Coins to Arrive in Shanghai Soon; Totaling Over 10 Million Coins; Recall Worn Corner Notes <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai has recently been lacking in copper-nickel subsidiary coins for regulation. With the end of the year approaching, the need is sincere. The Bank of China telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to transport a large amount of copper-nickel subsidiary coins to Shanghai before the end of the lunar year to facilitate turnover. According to the Bank of China's news yesterday, the central government ordered the Bank of China in Hong Kong to transport some to Shanghai last month, all of which have been loaded, but the number is small and still difficult to cope with. Now, the central government is continuing to transport over 1 million yuan in copper-nickel subsidiary coins, totaling over 10 million coins. It is heard that this time, there will be fewer hard coins and more corner notes, arriving in Shanghai in about ten days. It is also heard that after these subsidiary coins arrive in Shanghai, a portion will be used to exchange the worn corner notes on the market, and the market's needs at the end of the lunar year should be met comfortably.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Handling of Official Documents and Attachments <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The Directorate General of Posts has stated that regarding the submission of official documents and attachments by various agencies, it has been previously stipulated that if official documents and attachments are sealed together, the entire amount should be charged as letters according to regulations. If official documents and attachments are sealed separately and submitted at the same time, they must be bundled together. However, official documents are charged as letters, and attachments are charged as small parcels, and are delivered together by express delivery. Since this method was implemented, many agencies have complied with it, but some have sent attachments as printed matter in order to save postage. Now, transportation is difficult in various places, and light items such as letters and postcards must be transported out first, while heavy items such as printed matter are inevitably stored, resulting in attachments and official documents often not arriving at the same time, which is inconvenient for handling official business. In order to prevent similar situations from occurring again, in the future, official documents and attachments from various agencies should be sealed separately and handled according to the above-mentioned regulations. If they are sent to places with automobile transportation, the attachments must be sent as printed matter and should also be sent as express printed matter, with additional automobile fees (domestic inter-provincial mail, 0.2 yuan per kilogram or fraction thereof; inter-provincial mail, 0.4 yuan per kilogram or fraction thereof), so that each bureau can sort them out immediately upon receipt, without mixing them with other printed matter, in order to seal and dispatch them in advance and arrive at the same time as the official documents. Special orders are given to the subordinates to pay attention to handling it. The Shanghai Postal Administration has received orders and has already instructed all branch offices to comply with it.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Condition of Livestock Protection in December of Last Year; Report by the Livestock Protection Society <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>In December, the investigators spent most of their time inspecting livestock about to be sent to markets and slaughterhouses. Livestock resting places, such as pig pens and chicken and duck shops, were frequently visited. Since the Zhabei slaughterhouse could not be used, all meat consumed in Shanghai is now slaughtered in the concessions. Therefore, there is a great shortage of livestock resting places, and the Society had to pay attention to the condition of livestock being kept in the open, especially as winter was approaching. Sheds have been built everywhere, and it is hoped that with closer supervision, many unnecessary sufferings, such as sleeping outdoors, being tied with short leashes, and lacking food, can be avoided. During Christmas, the investigators also increased their work on dealing with cases of cruelty to poultry. They saw many carts going to the market, full of chickens in baskets. Due to negligence, the rice straw lining the bottom of the baskets had been worn out, so the chickens' heads and feet were often squeezed out of the holes in the bottom of the baskets. In the market, they often rebuked and stopped the practice of force-feeding poultry, especially geese, with bamboo poles to push grain husks and other things into their internal organs. Thanks to the cooperation of the Public Health Department and the police, several major cases of abuse were successfully prosecuted in the local court.</p>
<p>Due to the cold weather, the investigators also inspected the supply of straw in dog houses and other animal shelters to ensure it was sufficient. All stables were inspected, and the brands of each horse were also checked. In addition, the stable owners were advised to provide each horse with a blanket made of materials such as burlap sacks.</p>
<p>Several reports or complaints were received about cases of poultry and livestock suffering from skin conditions and being kept outdoors, such as leaky or strawless dog houses, monkeys kept outdoors, and monkeys, rabbits, and birds in shops suffering from various kinds of neglect. If the reports were found to be true after investigation, appropriate remedies were made. Gratitude is expressed for the cooperation of the police, as such cooperation is sometimes necessary. In one case, a dog had a severely injured foot, which was reported to the police and a veterinarian. The former said that they had no authority to remove it from its original owner, while the doctor said that the foot injury was incurable. The final compromise was to compensate the owner for the loss of money, and then the dog was able to be humanely euthanized.</p>
<p>Regarding occasional incidents on the streets, citizens often helped by watching over the animals while waiting for the Society's ambulance to arrive. Incidents included abandoned newborn puppies, crushed cats, and a dying cow. The latter was handled by the Municipal Council's salvage vehicle. The investigators inspected the site of the Yuyuan Road fire twice, where hundreds of refugee sheds had been burned down, and also discussed fire prevention for livestock sheds with the fire department.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Public Concession Police Arrest Large Number of Bandits in Various Hotels - Total of 32 Male and Female Suspects Detained - Confiscated Hand Grenades, Box Cannon, etc. <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Recently, bandits have been rampant in the concession, with robberies occurring frequently. In addition to organizing patrol teams and conducting strict inspections by section, the police authorities have also strictly instructed all Chinese and Western detectives in the various police stations to pay close attention. The Chinese Detective Chief of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, Tang Jian and Wu Chengmo, from 7:50 PM the night before to 4:30 AM yesterday morning, arrested a large number of male and female bandits in the British and French Concessions, totaling thirty-two suspects. They confiscated hand grenades, box cannons, pistols, etc. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>After receiving information, Detective Tang and others, together with Chinese Detective Sergeants Wang Jinsheng, Qi Mengqing, Xie Futang, and Western Detective Chiefs Taipeng Gelingfeier, first went to Room 205 of the Ning Merchant Hotel on Tianjin Road, where they arrested Chen Siming (aka Xiao Songjiang), a bandit from Songjiang. They then went to Room 47 of the Liangxi Hotel on Hubei Road, where they arrested Wu Laowu (aka Zhixiang) from Shanghai and Chen Xiaomao from Jiangbei. They then went to Room 32 of the Jiahe Hotel on Fujian Road, where they arrested Liu Jinjin and the woman Liu Sunshi, both from Suzhou. Later, they went to Guangxi Road</p>
<p>Daxin Hotel Room 306, where they arrested Cai Xiaodi (local), Liu Yuanzhou (Ningbo), Zhang Zhichang (Danyang), Song Jiabao (local), Ding Fangzheng (Wuxi), Dong Fusheng (local), Fang Alin (Ningbo), Li Debao (Pudong), Luo Cao, a local woman, and Hong Meimei, a local dancer from the Shengli Dance Hall on Beijing Road (17 years old, residing at 68 Ximen Road), along with Dong Cai, a woman from Ningbo (also a Shengli dancer, named Dong Xiu×), totaling eleven people. They confiscated a Swiss-style hand grenade, forty-one pawn tickets, one ten-tael silver ingot, four Western-style suits, and two pieces of cloth. Then they went to Fuzhou Road</p>
<p>Zhongzheng Hotel Rooms 24 and 25, where they arrested Fan Youda (aka Xiao Changzhou) from Changzhou, Xu Hongsheng (local), Cai Chen, a woman from Ningbo, and Wu Xie, totaling four people. They also went to Room 315 of the Dahuh Hotel on Edward Road, where they arrested Dai Tianyou (Pudong), Gong Zhu, a local woman, and Ji Shicai (aka Lao Donggua) from Haimen, totaling three people. At 409 Lafayette Road, they arrested Wang Yuelong (aka A Er), Wu Fugen, Wang Wu, and Wu Ye, all from Shanghai, totaling four people. They then went to Zhejiang Road</p>
<p>Qinghe Hotel Room 303, where they arrested Sun Heping and Sun Hanchang, both from Pudong. His father was at Room 5 of the Rongxiang Hotel on the Xizilaihuo Street in the French Concession, where they arrested Cai Yinbao from Chongming, confiscating a box cannon, eight bullets, a pistol, and six bullets. Finally, they went to 275-50 Mintini Yin Road, where they arrested Yan Guilin from Dajin and Wang Bin from Xuzhou, totaling twenty-three male bandits and</p>
<p>Nine female bandits. They were all taken to the police station, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer Li Zhishan described the circumstances of the crackdown, stating that due to the large number of people involved, the police had not yet had time to conduct a detailed investigation, and they were still in the process of apprehending accomplices, so he requested permission to detain them. After Judge Xiao briefly questioned the defendants, he ordered them to be remanded in custody and scheduled for another hearing in seven days.</p>

<p>Liu Ruomou, a guest from Ningbo residing in Room 5 of the Minle Hotel on Avenue Joffre, was 30 years old. Recently, due to economic pressure and difficulty finding work, he became disillusioned with life. Yesterday morning, he secretly drank poisonous liquid medicine in an attempt to commit suicide. The tea room attendant discovered this and rushed him to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>Ye Yusha, Chief of the Anti-Drug Department of the Public Concession Police, along with Detectives Li Shugui, Liu Zhaonian, Zhao Bao, Guo Shouxin, and others, recently learned that a large-scale drug manufacturing operation producing heroin and morphine was being organized in the front building at 608 Guangdong Road, with daily operations requiring approximately 400-500 yuan. They rushed to the location the day before to conduct a search. There, they arrested Xu Derong, Xu Deyao, Yuan Haishan, and Yuan Dong, a woman from Ningbo, all from Pudong. They confiscated sixteen and a quarter taels of heroin, twelve taels of morphine essence, various equipment for manufacturing drugs, over 190 yuan in legal tender, and two suitcases with false bottoms. It was found that Xu Wang, a woman from Ningbo and the second landlord of the house, was suspected of harboring them, so she was also taken back to the police station. Under investigation, it was learned that Xu and the others purchased these drugs from Chen Yaosheng, who in turn purchased them from Gao A'gen (aka Ma Pi A'gen)'s drug manufacturing plant in Caojiadu, Huxi. The detectives went to 18 Lane 190, Tysderong Road to arrest Chen Yaosheng, but the house belonged to another person, and they were unable to apprehend Chen at that time. Later, the detectives arrested Yoon Chi-sook, a Korean woman, at 608 Guangdong Road and sent her to the Japanese Consulate for questioning. Xu and the other five were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi filed charges separately under Articles 5 and 9 of the Anti-Drug Regulations and Article 30 of the Criminal Law, requesting permission to postpone the hearing for a detailed investigation. After the detectives submitted a report on the investigation and search, Judge Xiao Xie-fen interrogated them and ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody for another hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Moore Road - Rent Increase Dispute <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The landlords of Shengping Street on Moore Road in this city, citing the dense population and increased expenses, suddenly demanded rent increases from the tenants, with some increases reaching 30% of the original rent. Most of the residents there have been tenants for over ten years and have always had a harmonious relationship with the landlords. It is regrettable that such a large rent increase is being proposed at a time when the cost of living is rising sharply. After discussion, they unanimously rejected the increase. It is recently known that landlords in various neighborhoods, such as Runde Lane and Chengqing Lane, have sincerely negotiated with the tenants and restored the rent that had been temporarily increased and then reduced to the original amount, i.e., four yuan per double house and six yuan per triple house, starting from February. This spirit of mutual concession between the two parties is rare in the rent increase disputes in Shanghai. However, there are still landlords in one or two lanes who, regardless of the current environment, still insist on a large rent increase and threaten to build fences and cut off water. The tenants, feeling that they are all in the same place but divided by boundaries, are angered by this kind of oppressive measure and have resolutely rejected it.</p>

<p>Zhu Xinliang (31 years old, resident of Yangjiadu, Pudong), from Zhenjiang, hid a pistol and shot Wang Yongkui, the bodyguard of the puppet Su Xiwu, at around 3 PM on December 2nd last year near the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Hart Road. Because Wang was wearing an overcoat, only a hole was shot through the lapel of his coat. The Chinese police officer on duty at the location heard the gunshot and rushed to the scene, arresting Zhu and taking him and the weapon to the police station. The First Special District Court filed a public prosecution against him for attempted murder under Article 271, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The trial has already concluded, and Zhu Xinliang has been sentenced to two years and eight months of imprisonment for attempted murder as a repeat offender. The pistol, bullets, and magazine have all been confiscated. Zhu was dissatisfied with the verdict and appealed to the Second Branch Court. At 3 PM yesterday, Judge Yu opened the court for a hearing. Appellant Zhu Xinliang stated, "The First Instance Court sentenced me for attempted murder, which is really a bit heavy. To put it frankly, it's just attempted injury. Regarding my motive for hitting Wang Yongkui, I didn't want to do it myself. I was ordered by our captain to disguise myself as a vendor and secretly visit him on Hart Road for several days before taking action. But I didn't mean to kill him, just to warn him not to be a traitor. If I were determined to kill him, one shot would have hit him. Why would I hit his clothes? Moreover, the main reason I caused this case was for the country and for the entire nation. I ask the court to deal with it leniently according to law." At this point, the court instructed the defense lawyer to present their argument, and then announced the conclusion of the hearing, with the verdict scheduled for the 10th of this month.</p>

<p>Li Guisheng, a 39-year-old man from Ningbo who worked as a ticket inspector for the French Tram Company and resided at No. 10, Xinyi Lane, 257 Lujiawan Lujia Lane, had a daughter named Ronghua, who was 11 years old this year. At around 9 AM on the 29th of last month, Yang Chunsheng (46 years old), a man from Nanjing who sold soy sauce in the same kitchen shed, took advantage of the fact that Li and his wife were out and the girl was alone at home. He lured the girl into the kitchen shed where he lived, taking advantage of her youth and vulnerability, and committed indecent acts, injuring the girl's lower body with his fingers. After Li and his wife returned home and learned of this, they reported it to the French police station, who arrested Yang. The girl was sent to the hospital, where an examination confirmed the injury to her lower body. Yang was sent to the Second Special District Court for investigation and detention, and the girl was sent to the forensic doctor's office for examination on record. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liao Yuan continued the trial at the First Criminal Court. The French Concession Administration charged him with indecent assault under Article 24, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. The defendant was defended by lawyer Yan Huyuanteng. The court prohibited onlookers because the case was related to morality. As a result, the court announced the conclusion of the trial and scheduled the sentencing for the 10th. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>

<p>She nodded in agreement, but when asked who the murderer was, she was unable to speak and could not provide any information. Therefore, whether she was murdered or committed suicide is doubtful. The police authorities are currently conducting a thorough investigation. It is said that her husband went to Hudong Hospital to visit her yesterday afternoon and was very saddened, but he also did not know why his wife suffered such a tragedy.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Crime Incidents Occur Frequently in the Jessfield Area - Military Police Patrol in the Rain - Large Contingent of Police and Allied Military Armed Patrols Streets to Demonstrate Strength <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that a large contingent of public concession police and soldiers from the Italian Marine Corps "San Marco" stationed in Shanghai patrolled the Jessfield area in the rain yesterday (the 2nd). In recent weeks, crime incidents have occurred frequently in the area, the most serious of which was the shooting assassination on Wednesday morning (the 1st), which left two men dead and five injured. Assistant Police Chief Nuke led the patrol officers, most of whom wore steel mesh vests. The reserve police force, led by Inspector Lovell, also participated in the patrol, and Chief Superintendent Foggins led the patrol officers from the Jing'an Temple Police Station. The red police van of the reserve force also arrived on the scene, further intensifying the situation. The Italian garrison, led by their officers, wore helmets and other combat equipment, patrolling the streets. This demonstration was concentrated in the area around the Five Corners on Brennan Road, near where a fake detective was shot dead on Wednesday morning. Of the five Chinese injured at the time, one is in critical condition in the hospital. In the areas outside the concession, almost every lane has open gambling, and the frequent occurrence of crime incidents is mostly due to this.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Thugs Break into Bathhouse - Open Fire on Bathers - One Shot Wounds Two People - Assailant Apprehended on Scene by Detective <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at approximately 2:56 PM, a young man armed with a pistol suddenly broke into the Yu Chun Chi bathhouse at the intersection of Hubei Road and Fuzhou Road and, without explanation, opened fire on a middle-aged man who had finished bathing in the official bathing area. The bullet hit the middle-aged man in the neck, piercing his flesh, and also injured the hand of Hong Yongxiang, a back scrubber in the bathhouse. Seeing that his plot had failed, the assailant attempted to fire a second shot, but the bullet was stuck in the chamber and could not be fired. At that time, Guo Shouxin, a detective from the Anti-Drug Department of the Municipal Council Police Department, was also bathing in the same room and had just finished. Witnessing this situation, he quickly drew his pistol and fired two shots at the assailant, hitting him in the abdomen, causing him to fall to the ground. Seeing that the assailant had been apprehended, Detective Guo quickly telegraphed the police station and had him taken to the police station. After a brief interrogation, it was learned that the assailant's name was Han Qingyu, 28 years old, and the victim was Pan Ziyun from Jiangbei, a stevedore. It is understood that the motive for the attack was a conflict of interest. Han was originally Pan's disciple but was unexpectedly bought off by others, wanting to kill his master. Truly, people's hearts are unpredictable. All the injured, except for the assailant who was sent to the patrol hospital, were sent to other hospitals for treatment. However, the police are still afraid that there are other hidden facts, so they are continuing to investigate.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Cili Alliance Yanping Road Experimental Shelter houses over 5,000 refugees. After the refugee shelters on Dunxin Road were built, except for over 1,000 productive refugees, the rest were relocated. The shelter should also be closed. However, over 200 people, including the remaining refugees and all the shelter's section chiefs, security guards, and cleaners, deeply appreciated the excellent guidance and service of the shelter's management staff. In order to commemorate this permanently, at 2 PM yesterday, they gathered all the refugees in the original shelter's office to pay respects to the management staff Yan Fang, Nie Haifan, Zhu Airen, Chang Daotong, Wu Yongsheng, Huang Yonghe, Zhao Buyan, Xu Gang, and Wang Pengfei. The ceremony was solemn, beginning with the lighting of firecrackers, followed by music played by the band. Representative Liu Jiangzhou stepped forward to deliver a tribute speech, followed by a speech from the entire group, which was extremely tragic, moving the listeners to tears. After the speech, the representatives presented seven silver shields, and the band played music to pay respects. The entire group cheered enthusiastically, and applause thundered.</p>

<p>Chen Kaifu, from Qingcheng, Jiangbei, was formerly an actor in a Jiangbei opera troupe, residing at 503 North Shanxi Road in the Public Concession and 120 Xujiahui Road in the French Concession. In late December of last year, he was arrested by the Xinzha Police Station of the Public Concession for robbery and sent to the First Special District Court for prosecution. On the 24th of the same month, his wife, Chen Zhang (25 years old, from the same hometown as Chen), hired lawyer Yu Xiufang (residing at No. 2, Liyuanfang, Kangti Road, French Concession)</p>
<p>to defend him. At that time, Zhang signed a retainer agreement, stipulating a fee of 400 yuan, with no cash paid upfront, to be paid later. Yu then proceeded to prepare a defense statement and defend him. On January 12th of this year, Chen Kaifu was acquitted, but the fee was still unpaid. Yu then sent a letter demanding payment. At 5 PM on the 31st of last month, Chen Zhang</p>
<p>borrowed her relative nephew Chen Dehong (31 years old, formerly a patrol officer in the French Police, now running the Renhe Inn at 122 Xujiahui Road) and went to Yu's law firm to pay 50 yuan, insisting that Yu sign a receipt for 400 yuan. Yu refused, only issuing a receipt for the 50 yuan paid, which led to a verbal dispute. About ten minutes after they left, Chen Zhang and Chen Dehong again</p>
<p>gathered a group of Shanghai thugs, numbering dozens, and rushed to Yu's law firm, blocking the front and back doors, claiming they wanted to drag Yu out and beat him up. Yu immediately hid. The group then grabbed Yu's nephew, Dong Si-yi, tearing his clothes, making a threatening scene, and forcing Dong Si-yi to write a note canceling the previously established 400 yuan retainer agreement before dispersing. Afterwards, Yu reported the incident to the French police. In the early morning of the day before yesterday, the detectives arrested Chen Zhang and Chen Dehong and</p>
<p>interrogated them regarding the forceful writing of the note, pending investigation. Yesterday afternoon, the French police escorted the defendants to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District. Judge Liao Yuan interrogated them. Yuan Jiahong, a lawyer from the French Concession Administration, stated that the police department had not yet completed its investigation into the defendants' extortion and intimidation case and requested a postponement for further investigation, pending the detention of the defendants. The defendants hired lawyer Li Pengcheng for their defense. After the plaintiff, Yu Xiufang, recounted the previous events, the two defendants were questioned, and they admitted to using violence to force the writing of the note. The court ordered a postponement for another hearing on the 8th of this month. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Since the fall of the South City, Zhabei, and other inland areas, the Japanese, in order to prevent the spread of infectious diseases, announced vaccinations and smallpox inoculations. Small hospitals in the British and French Concessions of this city saw an opportunity and began selling vaccination certificates, which was discovered and reported by the authorities of both concessions. The hospital directors and doctors who sold these certificates were prosecuted and punished in court, as reported in various newspapers. Now, it has come to light that the Shanghai Hospital, established by Dr. Sheng Ouqing at 432 Avenue Edward VII, is still selling empty certificates for vaccinations that were not given, with a value of 30 cents in national currency per certificate. This was discovered by the French police, who sent a detective to the hospital to purchase a certificate. Yesterday, Xu Hongbin of the hospital was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District. The French Concession Administration prosecuted him for forgery. After Judge Qiu interrogated him, Xu Hongbin was sentenced to a fine of sixty yuan in court. If he could not pay the fine, he would be required to perform labor service, with two yuan equivalent to one day. The false certificate was confiscated.</p>

<p>The British-owned China General Omnibus Company, due to passenger congestion and insufficient existing vehicles, has ordered 47 new vehicles from the United Kingdom, 26 of which are double-decker buses, each capable of carrying 84 passengers. The remaining 21 are single-decker long buses, the same as those currently running on Route 9, each capable of carrying 66 passengers. This will greatly facilitate vehicle dispatching in the future. The company also plans to establish a new Route 16, starting from Yichang Road on Gordon Road, passing through Gordon Road, Xinzha Road, Carter Road, Avenue Edouard VII, Peak Road, Chongqing Road, and ending between Weihaiwei Road Racecourse and MacHale Road. The existing Route 14 runs from Cathay Hotel along Nanjing Road, MacHale Road, to Weihaiwei Road, Avenue Foch, and turns into Seymour Road to return. Now, this route will be extended, starting from Avenue Foch to Daduxi Road, passing the German School and Hong'en Hospital, and ending directly at Dunxin Road. It is reported that the French Concession Public Works Bureau has agreed to replant the trees on the south side of the sidewalk on Avenue Foch. As for when the ordered new vehicles will arrive, there is no definite date. However, the company has prepared everything and will rush to assemble them as soon as the vehicles arrive in Shanghai so that they can be put into operation as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Regarding the case of Geng Shoubao, the puppet "Detective Squad Leader" of Huxi, who was shot and killed in the Huxi extra-territorial road construction area on the morning of the 1st, it is rumored that Geng was originally a student of Lu, but he willingly defected, hoping to be promoted and become rich. He betrayed his teacher and went to worship Lu Ying as his "boss." Initially, he obtained the position of "leader" in the puppet "Detective Squad" of the South City. Because of his good maneuvering and flattering, after Xie Kai was removed from his position as the puppet "Branch Bureau Chief" of the South City, Geng was promoted to the position of puppet "Squad Leader" of Huxi. He was too greedy, and over the course of a month or so, people in both the gambling and opium industries of Huxi hated him to the bone. Therefore, Geng's assassination may have been a vendetta. After the event, a "Youth Corps Eliminates Traitors" note was found, which was likely a smokescreen released by the murderer.</p>

<p>Zheng Changkun from Ningbo, thirty-two years old, occupation unknown, arrived at the Jiaotong Hotel at 497 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession at 4 PM on the 31st of last month with a woman surnamed Zhou (thirty years old) from the same hometown, checked into room 23, and stayed for two nights. Ms. Zhou left the hotel on the 2nd of this month. Zheng remained in the original room that night. At 12 noon on the 3rd (yesterday), a hotel attendant named Chen Rongsheng (thirty-three years old, from Changzhou) noticed that he was still asleep. He knocked on the door and called out, urging him to get up and asking if he needed anything. After repeated calls for a long time, there was no response from inside the room, and the door was bolted from the inside, making it impossible to open. Suspicions arose, so he found a way to open the door and went inside to check. He discovered that Zheng had committed suicide by swallowing poison, and was on the verge of death. An empty bottle of poisonous liquid was left on the table in front of the bed. He immediately reported it to the French police station, who sent detectives to investigate. No suicide note was found, and the reason for the suicide is unknown. It is also unclear whether the woman surnamed Zhou who came with him and left the next day was his wife or a mistress. Zheng was transported to Renji Hospital, but due to severe poisoning, he died upon arrival. The body was transferred to the Tongren Fuyuan branch hall for an autopsy, awaiting the Special Second Court to send personnel for inspection.</p>
<h3 id="e110">1939 New Ford V8 Automobile: Visitors Come in an Endless Stream <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The 1939 Ford automobile series consists of three types: the Deluxe Ford with an 85-horsepower engine, the 85-horsepower Ford (formerly known as the Standard), and the 60-horsepower Ford. A brief description of each is as follows:</p>
<p>The Deluxe Ford V8 is most suitable for those who need a Ford V8 that is more economical in cost, more convenient to drive, and more fashionable in style, and who love luxurious vehicles. It has established a new standard of quality in the low-priced car category, with its brand-new streamlined design and modern and outstanding style. The radiator grille is quite low, and the top of the engine hood is quite deep, fully reflecting the style of this year's Lincoln Zephyr. All Ford cars are now equipped with hydraulic brakes, and the handbrake lever is a pistol-grip type installed under the left dashboard. It uses an 85-horsepower V8 engine as its power source, and its structure is stronger than the five million Ford V8 engines currently in use.</p>
<p>Ford V8 Automobile: The 1939 85-horsepower and 60-horsepower Ford V8 automobiles are roughly equivalent to last year's Standard Ford. Although they are practical vehicles in the Ford category, their appearance has been greatly improved. There are many people who drive cars and need economy and comfort, and these two types of vehicles are manufactured to meet this need. The car style is novel and spacious, and the interior and exterior of the car body are quite beautiful. The car body styles are roughly divided into three: two-door sedan, four-door sedan, and small sedan. This car has a new front end and a new engine hood. The headlights are embedded in the front fenders. The 85-horsepower engine of the Ford V8 is the same as the engine of the Deluxe Ford, with only one difference: the fan of the 85-horsepower engine of the Ford V8 is installed in the ordinary position of the engine, while the fan of the Deluxe Ford is directly installed on the crankshaft. The 60-horsepower engine, except for the use of new thin piston rings, remains the same and has not changed. The interior decoration of the car body is beautiful and moving, designed with the convenience and comfort of the driver and passengers in mind. The seats are quite deep, and their width is enough for three people to sit. The back seats of the sedans are also equipped with armrests. A common feature of the car bodies of various 1939 Ford automobiles is silence. This is the result of thoroughly studying the causes of car noise and its correction methods based on road conditions. The car body is forged from all steel, and all are equipped with safety glass, ventilation devices, and clear vision. The front window can be ventilated. All types of car bodies have huge luggage compartments and the characteristic of center-balanced riding. In a word, the Ford V8 automobile has beautiful lines, is equipped with safe hydraulic brakes, and the interior of the car body has various new values. It is truly the leader in the low-priced car category in 1939. It is now on display at the Meitong Automobile Company, the Ford dealer in this city. It is said that visitors come in an endless stream.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Overview of Higher Education in Ningxia: Only Four Students Currently Studying Abroad <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>In the years of the Republic of China 17 and 18 (1928-1929), there were more than ten students from Ningxia Province studying at universities in Beiping (Beijing), Xi'an, and other places. All of them were self-funded. In the 19th year of the Republic of China (1930), the provincial government stipulated measures for subsidies for domestic students studying outside the province, with a quota of twenty students, each subsidized with twenty yuan per month. As a result, the number of students studying outside the province increased sharply, exceeding the number of subsidies. In the 20th year of the Republic of China (1931), the quota for subsidies was increased to twenty-five, and in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), it was increased to forty. The province first stipulated regulations for selecting students to study abroad in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), but it has not yet been implemented. There are currently four students from the province studying abroad. Those studying in the United States are sent at the expense of Tsinghua University, and those studying in Japan are all self-funded. According to statistics from the years 21 to 25 of the Republic of China (1932-1936), the subjects studied by students from the province include political economy, commerce, and biology, each with one student; economics, art, each with one student; political science, chemistry, and physical education, and English language, and law, each with three students; literature and middle school studies, six students; education, four students; medicine, engineering, and agriculture, each with five students. The students selected for study abroad last year were unable to enroll due to the July 7th Incident (Marco Polo Bridge Incident). This year, they will continue to study at various universities, including three in engineering, and one each in biochemistry, medicine, physical education, education, and agriculture, and two in literature, totaling eleven students.</p>

The registration and payment procedures are currently being processed. The teachers hired are mostly teachers from Saint Francis and advanced graduates of the school. The teaching is serious and the results are excellent. The night school division will open on the evening of the 8th.</p>
<p>Jiangxi Senior Vocational School: Jiangxi Senior Vocational School and Jiangxi Primary and Secondary School on Shandong Road are known for their strict management and teaching. The number of students has increased sharply. Recently, new students have been registering very enthusiastically. Also, the original school building of the school on Nanshi Station Branch Road was inspected by personnel yesterday. All new and old buildings were completely destroyed. There was no timber to be found except for rubble. It is heard that the loss is indeed more than 100,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Saint Louis Night Middle School: No. 16 Wangjiasha Huayuan Road, Saint Louis Night Middle School is established by the church, well-managed, and registered by the Education Department. All courses are in accordance with the standards set by the department, and the efficiency and qualifications are the same as those of the day school. In addition to those with documentary proof, entrance procedures are exempt from examination. All courses are based on the standards issued by the Ministry of Education. The effectiveness and qualifications are also the same as those of the day school. Entrance procedures, except for those with documentary proof, are exempt from examination. Anyone without documentary evidence can find ways to remedy it, and each class has free or reduced tuition places, so those who register have been extremely enthusiastic in recent days. The entrance examination will be held on the 16th.</p>
<p>Wushi Commercial English Night School: Wushi Commercial English Night School, across from the Xiaocaichang Market on Shanhai Pass Road, has now resumed classes. The next semester is scheduled to begin on February 6th. Registration for old students and enrollment for new students will begin today. It is heard that in addition to the original famous Chinese and Western teachers, Dr. Lu Xirong, former professor of Amoy University, and Mr. White Daley, Bachelor of Arts from Oxford University, have been newly hired as professors. Those who have requested the prospectus and registered in recent days have been extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Hubbei Self-Reliance Middle and English Evening School: The school is located in Yongan Lane, North Henan Road. The teaching is serious, the time is convenient, and the tuition is very low. Especially, the transportation is convenient. Tram Route 14, Trolley 18 and Bus Route 5 are close to the entrance, so reporters are quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Qiming Primary School and Kindergarten: Cao Qiming, the owner of Caoyuan in Caohejing, has always been very frugal in his own life. All the income from his business is used for social undertakings. Recently, he appointed Mr. Wang Ziyang as the principal and co-founded Qiming Primary School and Kindergarten. Mr. Wang Ping has always had a lot of experience in education. He has now rented a large building at the intersection of Xinzha Road and Jiaozhou Road, which is very spacious. The downstairs is a large room, with a large courtyard in front, with sufficient sunshine and fresh air, which is suitable for kindergarten use. All the arrangements strive for beauty and artistry. The second and third floors also have more than a dozen classrooms of various sizes. The male and female teachers are all experienced. Moreover, most of the teachers in the small classes grew up in Beiping, and the pronunciation of Mandarin is very accurate. Senior students are also taught classical Chinese, so that they are equally emphasized with Mandarin Chinese. The management is strict, but it does not advocate the use of corporal punishment, but only guides them to make them naturally docile. The tuition is low. For every two or more siblings who come to study at the same time, each person will receive a reduction of two yuan. Recently, it has been seen that there are mostly poor children who have come to register. Therefore, thirty places with full tuition waivers have been set up, but only for those whose families are purely poor. Also, because the school building is spacious, students are specially allowed to board, and the quota is fifty, so that those who live far away can also come to study. The school opened on the first day, and the number of registrants was extremely enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Huade Primary School: Jiang Rusu, the founder of Huade Primary School on Xindagu Road and Chengdu Road, charges low tuition fees. It opened on the 24th of last month and is now in class. The number of students has increased to more than 250. It is heard that there are not many vacancies left.</p>
<p>School Overview</p>
<h3 id="e120">Shanghai Law College Attached Middle School: Established by Chu <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Fucheng, the president of the college, in the spring of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938). When it was first established, it established a senior high school department. In the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), a junior high school was added. The school currently has two classes each in the first and second grades of the general studies department of the senior high school, two classes each in the spring and autumn semesters of the business department in the first and second grades, one class in the first grade of the business department of the junior high school, and three classes each in the first, second, and third grades of the general studies department. This semester, there are a total of 200 students.</p>
<p>Because the school is affiliated with the Law College, it is better equipped. The library equipment includes the complete Ten Thousand Volume Library and the Chinese photographic reprint of the Complete Collection of Books, as well as more than 10,000 reference books for each subject. Other equipment, such as calculators and typewriters used in the business department, and physical and chemical instruments and biological specimens used in the general studies department, are all available. As for the selection of teachers, Principal Chu Fengyi emphasizes both teaching and experience. The general studies teachers include Shi Shaoming, Wang Zhe'an, Qian Zhenhai, Zou Mengchan, Cao Xinhan, Yang Jueilian, Zhong Guangran, Wu Jingshan, Wang Mengshu, etc., all of whom have taught at famous provincial middle schools for more than ten years and have written extensively. In addition to Principal Chu himself teaching statistics and rapid calculation, the business teachers include Wang Xiaotong, who teaches commercial history, and Sun Huairen, who teaches economics overview and commercial knowledge, all of whom are business experts and have taught at various universities in Shanghai for many years.</p>
<p>The school attaches great importance to the basic subjects of Chinese, English, and mathematics. Since the last semester, the junior high school department has added two class hours of Chinese per class, and the senior high school department has added two class hours of Chinese and English each. From the first year of junior high school to the first year of senior high school, students must write Chinese diaries every day, and senior high school students must write English diaries every day. The attendance and diligence of diaries and other extracurricular exercises are carefully counted and rewarded and punished separately. This semester, in order to improve the effectiveness of learning, the Chinese, English, and mathematics courses added to each grade will break down the grade levels and be divided into classes according to the level, so that the basic subjects can reach the standard level. The intention is good, and its effectiveness is not difficult to foresee.</p>

<h3 id="e122">All Events for Next Year's World Games Total 417: Many New Programs for Men and Women Added: Budgeted at Two Billion Finnish Marks <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>(Helsinki, January 3rd) Since the Finnish authorities began actively preparing for the next World Games, progress has been extremely rapid. In order to enrich the preparation funds, the parliament has passed a special budget, totaling two billion Finnish marks (calculated at the current exchange rate, that is, one million pounds sterling and five million US dollars). The remaining one billion marks is being made up by appropriations from the Helsinki Municipal Government. The municipal government is now starting construction of the Olympic Village, located in a densely wooded area in the suburbs, with fresh air and convenient transportation. The dormitories for athletes from various countries have a total of twenty-nine buildings, all of which are new three-story buildings. The total number of bedrooms is 2,500. The dining hall for all representatives will also begin construction. The general office of the village will be located in a primary school.</p>
<p>At the last World Games held in Berlin, there were a total of 129 competition events. However, the program for the conference to be held in Finland will increase by three events, totaling 23 track and field events, 8 indoor sports events, 16 swimming and water polo events, 7 rowing events, 4 yachting events, 9 dinghy races, 14 wrestling events, 5 weightlifting events, 8 boxing events, 5 shooting events, 7 fencing events, 6 equestrian events, 1 soccer event, 2 gliding events, and 1 modern pentathlon. In the last World Games, there were competitions in handball, hockey, polo, basketball, and women's indoor sports. However, in the 12th Congress in 1940, the above competitions were discontinued and replaced with other new programs. The new events are (1) 10,000-meter race walking (2) Women's shot put (4) Women's long jump (4) Women's 200-meter race. In addition, two new 300-meter and 50-meter rifle shooting events have been added. As for gliding competitions, this is also an unprecedented event. Therefore, the total number of events has reached 132. Adding 15 art competitions, the total is 147.</p>
<p>When the competition is held in the future, major newspapers and news agencies around the world will send reporters to the conference to report the daily competition situation to the outside world. The organizing committee has decided to set up 600 seats in the venue to treat the "uncrowned emperors" preferentially. The allocation of the seats is based on the number of athletes in each country.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Chiang Tzu-fan Has Become a "Widow" <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>The other day, a friend showed me a couplet sent to Mr. Chiang Tzu-fan of Changshu, which was very interesting. I met Mr. Chiang a few times twenty or thirty years ago, and he was indeed an interesting person. Therefore, I thought that an interesting person and interesting events would make for an interesting article. So I wrote some of Mr. Chiang's history and gave it the title "The Salted Pork Shop and the Little Traitor," which was published in this magazine to amuse readers.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from Mr. Song Ping-heng, along with an article titled "Corrections to 'The Salted Pork Shop and the Little Traitor.'" This article contains a very detailed record of Mr. Chiang's life. I learned that Mr. Chiang is now seventy-two years old. My statement that he was in his sixties was indeed an error. I am deeply grateful for the clarification. Fortunately, my account was not intended to be a complete biography of Mr. Chiang. As long as it is generally accurate, a few errors and omissions are acceptable.</p>
<p>However, the most important point that the letter sought to correct was the matter of the chairman of the maintenance society. In fact, being a member is acceptable, and being the chairman is not necessarily unacceptable. Mr. Song's letter stated, "When the Sino-Japanese War broke out, Chiang sought refuge in Tangkou. Shen Jiu-gao and others from the town organized a maintenance society and sent messengers to invite Mr. Chiang and Zhu Qing-zhi to participate. However, his son stopped him. Wang entered the city and falsely claimed to be Chiang's representative, agreeing to become a member of the maintenance society (not the chairman). Messengers came and went on the road, repeatedly forcing him to enter the city. Unable to resist, he tearfully joined the society on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh lunar month last year, serving as the director of the education department. After a month, he resigned. The petty officials surrounded him, preventing him from leaving the city. He is still in the city, living a life of melancholy."</p>
<p>Based on this passage from the letter, I have a few points of confusion. In short, Mr. Song's letter is simply to defend Mr. Chiang from the charge of "getting involved." But the above passage states, "Intended to go, but was stopped by his son," suggesting that Mr. Chiang indeed had a happy willingness to go. However, because of his young master's lack of understanding, he dispelled the old man's excitement. Later, it says, "Joined the society in tears." Where did these "tears" come from? It also says, "Surrounded by petty officials, preventing him from leaving the city." Now that Mr. Chiang is neither the chairman of the maintenance society nor a member, nor the director of the education department, then Mr. Chiang is completely free. What is the purpose of the petty officials surrounding him? However, I have heard that Mr. Chiang has been promoted again. Now, I don't need to get to the bottom of these things, because Mr. Song has sent a letter to correct the errors, and I have raised a few questions to ask for guidance. The letter also includes two couplets by Mr. Chiang, mocking others and himself, which are very interesting. I have recorded them below. Or, it is said that these were not written by Mr. Chiang:</p>
<p>"Barehanded and empty-fisted, holding up the short man's testicles, organizing a maintenance society.</p>
<p>Heart in throat, watching the late master's face, flattering the pacification delegation."</p>
<p>"If there is ambition, be firm, sighing that I am not as good as the old man of Chang Le.</p>
<p>Am I the only one drunk? Who knows that I am now a 'widow.'"</p>
<h3 id="e132">A Brief Discussion on Traitors <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Ge'er</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people once conducted a "psychological analysis" of "traitors." It is said that there are four reasons for the emergence of "traitors": (1) those who do not deeply understand the pain of being a subjugated people and are greedy for money or unemployed; (2) those who hold the view that resistance is bound to fail and attempt to establish false merit in advance; (3) those who have received imperial favors and therefore wish to repay the imperial grace; (4) those who are completely ignorant and greedy for money or unemployed.</p>
<p>For reasons (1) and (4), we can persuade the "greedy for money and unemployed," and the enemy's brutal behavior has long proven that it is impossible to be a subjugated people. British journalist H.J. Timperley's "Japanese Military Atrocities in China: The Eyewitness Record" is the best book on the "pain of being a subjugated people." Of course, in addition to this, we must also provide relief to the unemployed. Otherwise, asking them to practice saving the country on an empty stomach is impossible. The "Bo Yi and Shu Qi" who were "ashamed to eat the millet of Zhou" probably cannot be found among the "ignorant." In fact, we definitely cannot ask them to learn from "Bo Yi and Shu Qi." The example of "Bo Yi and Shu Qi" should be remembered by the "high-ranking officials and noblemen" who are "well-fed and well-clothed."</p>
<p>Regarding reasons (2) and (3), these kinds of "traitors" are "incurable," and we must mercilessly whip them. If possible, it would not be excessive to "punish" them by eating their flesh and sleeping on their skin.</p>
<p>Those who have received imperial favors and therefore repay the imperial grace are already unspeakable. This is because they have become slaves by nature. This is the nature of all "domestic dogs." It is a disgrace to add the "title" of "human" to them. If we tolerate these kinds of "things" remaining in the world, it would be a very bad influence. If we do not eliminate them, the future of mankind is simply unimaginable!</p>
<p>However, what is even more poisonous are those "jacks of all trades" who consider themselves "outstanding talents who understand current affairs." Seeing the enemy's "three axe" brute force, they believe that they are bound to win and that their own side is bound to lose. Therefore, in order to establish false merit in advance, they beautify it by saying "If I don't go to hell, who will?" and boldly take up "positions" such as "committee member" or "mayor." Of course, there are also some "smart people" who hold the "three nos" principle. It seems that they do not want to establish "false merit" and appear to be serious "saviors." However, these kinds of people are even more insidious. The so-called "red-spotted pit viper in the cave" refers to these cunning and treacherous schemers. However, this is not what I am talking about.</p>
<p>Speaking of those who ride the wind and steer the helm, holding the "China is bound to lose" theory and taking the "mayor" of Shanghai, Fu Xiao'an, recently "developed a sense of regret." The reason is that "the time for China to use its advantages is definitely not far away." Therefore, he is extremely frustrated and believes that "in six months, he may no longer be able to stand in Shanghai." This so-called "developed a sense of regret" should not be seen as his "remorse." Rather, China's protracted resistance will only lead to the elimination of these opportunists, which is very beneficial to the establishment of a new China in the future.</p>
<p>The War of Resistance is truly great! Ah!</p>
<h3 id="e133">A Wandering Soul on the Edge of the World <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Si Hua</p>
<p>“Algiers”</p>
<p>A film produced by United Artists and shown at the Grand Shanghai Theatre</p>
<p>After watching "Algiers," I cannot help but express my great admiration for the director's exquisite artistic skills. His grasp of the atmosphere and emotions, and his use of weaving and connecting, make the entire film a seamless whole, gripping the audience and not allowing them to take a breath. At the end of the play, the impression of emotion is branded on the audience's hearts.</p>
<p>First, the atmosphere is handled richly: (A) The unique music of North Africa and the special architecture of Algeria fully express the local color there. (B) The police are attacked from all sides when they enter the Casbah, which shows that the situation inside the area is complicated and it is difficult for the search team to enter it. At the same time, Mouko's escape from the police introduces the complexity of the fan structure in Mouko's scam. (C) The spy Reges is lured into the room by Mouko, sits down, and the camera pans across the doors on both sides. Mouko's partners walk out calmly, two sitting by the door and two sitting behind Reges. As a result, Reges becomes uneasy, gradually shivering, with sweat pouring down his forehead, and he becomes dizzy... Playing cards, Reges doesn't know what card to play. Mouko's partner instructs him from the side... Beaulieu returns injured, holding a gun to shoot Reges, Reges screams wildly, music rises to cover the screams, Reges dies.</p>
<p>Second, the interweaving is lively: (A) When the police are searching in the Casbah, Mouko and others stand still. When the police and others come out, Mouko and other partners scatter in all directions. The director uses extremely short film and a very clear and lively technique to write that guns are fired from above, below, left, and right, and from a distance, one can see the chaotic situation of the search team. (B) Before Mouko prepares to have a good time with Gaby, he is so proud that he sings while shining his shoes. The singing echoes in the space, and short scenes describe the gentlemen dancing with the singing. (C) Mouko and Gaby are sitting opposite each other. After the cut, Agnes opens the window in another room and describes the affectionate state of Mouko and Gaby opposite each other through the curtains.</p>
<p>Third, the lyricism is delicate: (A) Agnes' deep love for Mouko is written by the director many times as she stares at Mouko. Every time Mouko leaves the district, she jealously traps him. (B) At the first meeting between Mouko and Gaby, the director uses the camera eye to represent Mouko's eyes, focusing on the beads and bracelets on her chest and arms. In one aspect, they stare at each other silently with their eyes. This shows that Mouko has been attracted by her beauty after coveting her jewelry. (C) Mouko's two situations of not waiting for Gaby are different. The first time, he even argues with his partner. The second time, he resolutely leaves the district for the city.</p>
<p>Fourth, do not let go of the subtle details: (A) Wherever Mouko goes, two partners will calmly follow him out. (B) After Mouko polishing his shoes, the director has twice featured his shoes, and the audience can tell at a glance that they are Mouko's.</p>
<p>Fifth, the sighing ending: Mouko gets on the boat, looks into the room through the window, and Gaby sits with her back to the outside. He can't see it for a while, until he looks down. Everyone thinks he can see her, but the camera switches to behind him and three spies have already grabbed him. Handcuffed and getting off the boat, he asks for a moment to stay. When the boat starts, he sees Gaby on the top of the boat. His emotions surge and he shouts, the sound of the whistle, Gaby covers her ears, he runs wildly and shouts, the detective shoots and Mouko falls to the ground and dies. The reason why the audience feels sighing is because Mouko is like a hero in the Casbah, and secondly because Mouko and Gaby failed to meet.</p>
<p>In addition to the director's exquisite skills, what is worth praising is Charles Boyer's Mouko, who is calm, handsome, and has vigor. Secondly, there is Sigrid Gurie's Agnes, whose eyes are always burning with love and jealousy. Hedy Lamarr's charm and her quiet performance of love are also very good.</p>
<p>However, the script doesn't have much meaning. It is just a romance, a tragic love triangle. But because it is set against the background of a scam, it looks novel and cute.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Miscellaneous Notes on Jewish Refugees <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Zhen</p>
<p>Most of the Jews living in Germany had some money. Now, after being expelled by Hitler, they used the beautiful name of clarifying their bloodlines to confiscate their property and force them to leave the country and become homeless refugees.</p>
<p>They regarded Shanghai as their only new land for making a living, so batches of refugees came one after another. Their temporary dining place is in the YMCA on Szechuan Road. The author has many opportunities to meet them day and night, so I will introduce some of what I have observed to everyone.</p>
<p>The clothes of these refugees are very neat. Many of the materials and tailoring they wear are very particular, so at a glance, you can tell that their families used to be very well-off. According to them, many of them used to be small rich people in Germany and owned considerable assets.</p>
<p>Most of them are between the ages of twenty and forty, with very few elderly and young people. There are more men than women, and very few children. According to the author's personal observation, single men account for the largest number, and middle-aged men are especially numerous.</p>
<p>The Western food they eat every day is very simple: two slices of coarse bread (no butter), a soup, and a vegetable. This is very different from what they used to eat at home. Imagining it for them, I can't help but sigh endlessly. However, compared with the refugees in our country, they are much happier. According to them, each person's meals cost a total of four yuan in national currency, while our country's refugees only need one yuan in national currency a day. They can also be said to be high-class refugees.</p>
<p>When they arrived in Shanghai, their luggage was very simple, only a suitcase with them. It is said that each person is only allowed to take these things out of the country, and they are not allowed to take anything else away. They are also not allowed to carry much cash, only some for their needs along the way. Hitler's intentions can be seen in this.</p>
<p>When they first arrived in Shanghai, their faces were very calm, and they did not talk much, revealing how painful they were inside. The pain of not having a motherland is indeed painful!</p>
<p>Now, some of the refugees have found decent jobs, so compared to when they first arrived, they are finally more stable. Several younger people who have found jobs have even organized table tennis teams and basketball teams and want to compete with the teams in Shanghai. It is said that their table tennis team will compete with the YMCA junior table tennis team on February 4. The situation at that time will be very unique, and it is expected that many people will come to watch. Moreover, it is said that this competition was also arranged by themselves with the junior division, because some of those who love table tennis cannot help but feel itchy and eager to try when they see Chinese teenagers in Tongling playing table tennis.</p>
<p>Now, in about one or two weeks, they will all have places to live and will not have to run to the YMCA twice a day to eat.</p>

<p>Episode 3: Adoring the Legacy and Remembering the Old Martyr, Opening the Mind and Asking the Literate Little Teacher</p>
<p>I only heard the elementary school student say: "Grandpa! Let me tell you another section. After listening to this section, you will be able to understand the section above." The old man touched the child's head and said: "Good child! You explained it very clearly. There are several characters here that your grandpa doesn't recognize. Are they some kind of new characters?" The elementary school student said: "Yes! Now, we Chinese have created many new characters, but they are related to science. At school, the teacher gave me a table. I'll go back and find it for grandpa." The old man said: "Good! Then I have a white rabbit with long ears and red eyes. I know you like it, and I will give it to you too." The child jumped up happily after hearing this, hugging the old man's head and not letting go. The two Miss He were a little fascinated when they saw this, thinking: This is really a bit wonderful. Look at the two of them, one old and one young, they must be a grandfather and a grandson. Only a grandfather would teach his grandson to read, but now the grandson is teaching his grandpa. What do you say, after talking about this section, you will understand. And the old man asked the young child for advice, and said: "Your grandpa doesn't know a few characters." It's really a strange story. Just as they were wondering, Jin Danyu and Lin Jiancheng also walked over. The old man recognized Jin Danyu and greeted her: "Miss Jin, how do you have time to come here to play today?" Jin Danyu smiled: "Old Huang! Are you going to have your grandson tell you a story today?" The old man seemed a little embarrassed when he heard this, and said: "I'm making a fool of myself!" He said to his grandson, "Why don't you say hello to Miss Jin? She gave you a prize the day before yesterday." The child stood up as expected and bowed to Jin Danyu. He also told her, "Grandpa said he would give me a pair of white rabbits with long ears and red eyes tomorrow." Miss Jin said, "Your grandpa not only has rabbits, but also other fun things." Saying this, they left here. He Liyu said: "Sister Danyu, do you know this old man? I just thought it was very strange, why would an old man ask a child about words? So they are grandfather and grandson?" Jin Danyu said: "This shows how many people in our China used to be uneducated, and now it's too late to regret it. To be honest, this old man used to be a gardener in our house. His name is Ah Mao. I was young at that time, and he used to hold me to kindergarten. He is a good person, but he doesn't know a word. At first, they thought that being a gardener didn't require knowing any words. Later, they realized that people who don't know words suffer in many ways!" (30)</p>

<h3 id="e136">On the Value of Life <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Fu</p>
<p>Since people are born into the world, they all have the desire to live. This means: "I want to live, I want to live well in the world." Therefore, whether rich or poor, wanting to live is something that everyone desires. Even if someone is so poor that they become a beggar, they would not want to harm themselves and say, "I don't want to live anymore."</p>
<p>But the value of life is not truly in seeking comfort and pleasure in life. That is to say, it is not right to think: "I just need to have clothes to wear, food to eat, a house to live in, and a road to walk on." Because in addition to clothing, food, housing, and transportation, the main thing for people is to do something meaningful. Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are of course necessary conditions for maintaining our daily lives, but doing something meaningful is the only main purpose of our lives. If we only care about clothing, food, housing, and transportation and disregard doing something meaningful, then how are we different from animals, wriggling and stupid, only seeking to be full? And how can society progress?</p>
<p>So, strictly speaking, the purpose of seeking life should be in doing something meaningful and not in mere living. The value of life lies in this. If one only seeks life and disregards doing something meaningful, then they have no contribution to society and no value in their own life. It can be said that their life is neither beneficial to the world, nor is their death harmful to the world. The so-called lice of the nation, the so-called parasites of society, are precisely these kinds of people, because they are not only useless to the world, but sometimes their existence is harmful to the world.</p>
<p>We can rightly say that a person with great aspirations will surely only care about how to achieve their cause and not care about how to enjoy their life. To give a few simple examples: When Wen Tianxiang was ordered to serve the king, he used all his family wealth for military expenses. When Shi Kefa was supervising the army in Huaiyang, he did not use an umbrella and did not eat rich food. Why did they not seek comfort in their lives and instead willingly suffer like this? It is precisely because they can endure hardship in their own lives, but they must do something meaningful. Only traitors like Jia Sidao, even when the country was about to fall, built lavishly, pampered their concubines, and made crickets fight; and like Ma Shiying, sold official positions to enrich themselves, while the military expenses of the various towns could be withheld. Their concept was only about the comfort of life, and they never thought about the cause for which they were responsible!</p>
<p>So, those who only seek comfort in life are definitely not people who accomplish great things. Only seeking comfort in life is definitely not the true purpose of life. Confucius said: "Do not seek to live by harming benevolence, but sacrifice your life to achieve benevolence." Mencius said: "Life is what I desire, and righteousness is also what I desire. If I cannot have both, I will give up life and choose righteousness." It can be seen that in addition to seeking life, people still have the necessity of achieving benevolence and choosing righteousness. The so-called achieving benevolence and choosing righteousness is what I call doing something meaningful. Those who do something meaningful can bring benefits to society and gain the true value of life for themselves.</p>
<p>Since the true value of life lies in this, then should we still worry about seeking personal comfort in life? Today, there is no shortage of those who sell their souls, only seeking to live in peace, and beautifying it by saying: "I want to live, so I do this." It seems that the meaning of life lies only in this, and the purpose of seeking life lies only in this. These words and deeds are truly off by a hair, but the consequences are a thousand miles off.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Roundup <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Ge</p>
<p>Hundreds of small fishing boats are docked in the pond, densely packed together, looking like fish scales from afar. Outside the harbor, there are also a hundred or so large fishing boats, their masts resembling a beautiful and lush bamboo forest.</p>
<p>The sun climbs out of the sea, stirring up surging waves that crash into the pond, causing the thousands of fishing boats to rock incessantly, startling the group of young and sturdy fishermen. They jump up in one go, rub their eyes, reel in the anchor ropes, and cheerfully sing: "...The legacy left by our ancestors, we rely on it to get through summer and winter. Yellow croaker is better than gold; ribbonfish is more precious than jade rings... We fear not the many bandits, for we are united and unafraid of their fierceness. We are brave fishermen!..." They hum like that, and then begin their work.</p>
<p>The large fishing boats that go first, a long line, truly resemble a long string of ribbonfish. The majestic singing fills the entire sea. In the sea breeze, it brings distant, empty echoes.</p>
<p>Outside the harbor, the boats disperse in all directions, each going to cast their nets and quietly fish.</p>
<p>The sea is extremely calm, as if it has fallen asleep.</p>
<p>In a corner of the sea, a small warship with a Band-Aid flag suddenly appears, heading straight towards the large fishing boats.</p>
<p>"Ah! The bandits are coming! Are we just going to wait for death?... No! No! Strike first, get the advantage! Little San, blow the horn, let them come to help us! Hai Gen, you prepare the cannons, quick! Quick!" The captain shouts excitedly, rushing to the earthen cannon himself, helping to load the gunpowder.</p>
<p>"Da de... da de da..." the horn sounds.</p>
<p>"Boom!" The captain personally fires the first shot. The shell flies over, hitting the bow of the Japanese ship, shaking it slightly forward.</p>
<p>"Boom!" The bandit ship returns fire, the shell flying not far from a fishing boat, stirring up waves several feet high.</p>
<p>"Rat-a-tat-tat..." the bandit ship fires its machine gun.</p>
<p>"Guys! Fire the guns! Hurry! What are you waiting for! Damn it! Fire the guns, fire the guns! Quick! Quick!" The captain strains his throat, shouting loudly. He snatches an earthen gun from a mate beside him, aims and fires.</p>
<p>"Boom... boom boom..." the bandits' cannons and earthen cannons.</p>
<p>"Rat-a-tat-tat..." the machine gun.</p>
<p>"Bang! Crack-bang!... Crack-crack-bang...!" Earthen guns.</p>
<p>Soon, many other large fishing boats, following the sound of the horn, sail over. Realizing the danger here, they immediately surround the bandit ship, one to the east, one to the west, like many starving fish competing for a large piece of bread.</p>
<p>"Boom! Boom!..." Shells fly towards the bandit ship like raindrops. Under the fierce attack, it begins to tilt.</p>
<p>"Ah!" A bullet hits the captain's raised arm, and crimson blood gushes from his sleeve. He can't help but cry out.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Captain! You! You!" The mates gather around.</p>
<p>"Are you crazy? Don't worry about me! Fire the cannons! Fire the guns! Fire quickly! Quick! Quick..." The captain's eyes bulge, his teeth clenched.</p>
<p>"Boom! Boom boom!... Bang! Crack-bang! Crack!..."</p>
<p>The bandit ship cannot withstand it. The stern sinks into the water first, followed by the middle... and finally the bow. Thick white smoke rises on the water surface, gradually dissipating. Finally, the Band-Aid flag on the bandit ship's mast disappears into the water as well.</p>
<p>"Boom... boom boom boom!" A few final farewell salutes are fired towards the water where the bandit ship sank.</p>
<p>The captain raises his bloodied arm, and everyone excitedly joins in singing: "...We fear not the many bandits, for we are united and unafraid of their fierceness! We are brave fishermen!..."</p>
<p>The faces of the wounded are lit with the glory of honor, forgetting their pain. They have finally annihilated the invading bandits, avenging the great hatred of Meitian!</p>

<p>— Tian Yu</p>
<p>These past few days, I happened to be leafing through Yuwen Maozhao's "Chronicles of the Great Jin Dynasty" and saw an essay on the Great Jin ruler's installation of Zhang Bangchang, and another on the installation of Liu Yu. After reading these two essays carefully, I deeply admire the Great Jin ruler's intelligence. His tone of appeasement truly resembles that of people today; his wishful thinking is also similar to that of people today. This is truly a mirror for the present, so I borrowed the four characters "Comprehensive Mirror for Governing" as the title, and excerpted them as follows for the appreciation of the public:</p>
<p>(1) Essay on the Installation of Zhang Bangchang</p>
<p>"...Thinking of the Song Dynasty, it was truly a neighbor... Heaven was disgusted with its virtue, and the people lived in misery; and yet it only blamed others, without knowing how to examine itself... Therefore, it mobilized troops and commanded generals to punish the guilty and comfort the people... Now that the country lacks a ruler and the people should be united, but remembering its beginnings, it truly did not covet land, so it ordered the marshal's office to elect a worthy man..."</p>
<p>(2) Essay on the Installation of Liu Yu</p>
<p>"...Without annexing your territory, to show the virtue of not being greedy; only moving its ruler, to highlight the intention of punishing the guilty... We inform Liu Yu... living in a chaotic country, born in an unfortunate era. Though wise, a hundred miles are useless in the face of a lost state; though supremely virtuous, three men might be willing to serve the Zhou Dynasty... Entrusting you with territory, along with the former state of Chu. You must pacify and gather them, and find a suitable place to live. You must respect Heaven's will above, and follow the people's desires below, be loyal to the royal family, and faithfully protect the borders..."</p>
<p>Look at this! In the first essay, what "punishing the guilty and comforting the people," "truly not coveting land," how high-sounding they are. The second essay begins by reiterating "truly not coveting land"; the middle paragraph praises Liu Yu to the highest degree, elevating the status of a traitor, how could the traitors not be moved to tears; the final paragraph indicates the task of the Han traitors, which is to establish a new order and be slaves of the Great Jin Dynasty. These two essays are well-organized and profound in meaning. I think the Great Jin ruler can be considered the inventor of "using the Chinese to control the Chinese"!</p>

<p>They strengthen the people's confidence in victory.</p>
<p>There is no lightning in the sky, nor any thunder,</p>
<p>But in the distance resounds the booming of cannons.</p>
<p>It turns into the death knell for the invaders;</p>
<p>It represents the angry roar of millions of people.</p>
<p>There is no rainbow in the sky, nor any sunlight,</p>
<p>But in the distance floats a patch of red, lined with a mass of white light.</p>
<p>It is our national flag, our national flag;</p>
<p>It will bring us the glory of victory.</p>

<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>"Because he's going to the front lines this afternoon to direct military operations, I was afraid he'd be delayed if we sat at the table for too long, so I came early with him."</p>
<p>The town mayor was indeed astute. Hearing Mr. Ye say this, he quickly left his seat and went to the back to order his subordinates to set up the banquet. Before long, the banquet was prepared. Everyone had to defer to one another for a while, and in the end, Mr. Ye and Commander Ye took the upper seats. The other guests also sat down in order of their status and position. Seeing that everyone was seated, Mayor Chen took a wine pot, stood up, and said:</p>
<p>"Today we are all here to welcome Commander Ye. The fact that our Hepu Town has produced a figure like Commander Ye is not only a glory for Mr. Ye's family, but also a glory for our entire town! I now, on behalf of the entire town, respectfully offer Commander Ye a toast, wishing Commander Ye good health and an early victory over the × bandits."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he came over with a smile to pour wine for Commander Ye. Who knew that Commander Ye would decline, simply cupping his hands and smiling, saying: "I can't drink." No matter how much Mayor Chen and the guests pleaded, it was no use. Mayor Chen couldn't help but put down the wine pot and say to Commander Ye:</p>
<p>"Then, please have half a cup."</p>
<p>Commander Ye couldn't resist the gesture, so he reluctantly accepted half a cup. Mayor Chen then poured wine for Mr. Ye and the other guests, settled the table, and then the conversation began. Everyone eagerly asked Commander Ye about the situation on the front lines. Commander Ye calmly drew on the table with his ivory chopsticks and said:</p>
<p>"The enemy landed at Jinshanwei this time with the guidance of Han traitors. Their intention is clearly to encircle the rear of Shanghai. However, this is not their entire goal. They will definitely divide their forces to strike directly at Jiaxing, attempting to occupy this important stronghold that controls the two railways of Shanghai-Hangzhou and Suzhou-Jiaxing. If Jiaxing falls to them, then they can attack Hangzhou in the south and assault the rear of Suzhou in the north."</p>
<p>Hearing the name "Jiaxing," the people at the table couldn't help but be shaken, because this place was not far from here, and the name was familiar to everyone. The town relied on Jiaxing for most of its daily necessities and the outlet for its agricultural products. Especially Cai Hefeng, his timber business relied entirely on the area along the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Suzhou-Jiaxing railways, so he was particularly anxious, unable to help but ask urgently:</p>
<p>"In Commander Ye's view, is it possible for the × army to capture Jiaxing?"</p>
<p>"This is a military secret, I cannot disclose it." Commander Ye smiled and gestured, saying, "However, my mission is to defend the southern section of the Suzhou-Jiaxing Railway. I will definitely do my best to stop the enemy from coming over."</p>
<p>These words reassured everyone a little. Mayor Chen couldn't help but praise profusely:</p>
<p>"Commander Ye is not only a pillar of the country, but also a protector of our hometown..."</p>
<p>His words were interrupted by a plate of stir-fried dishes brought up by the cook, because several eager guests had already raised their glasses. He had no choice but to raise his glass as well, but he did not drink, quickly raising his chopsticks, making an inviting gesture, and saying to Commander Ye:</p>
<p>"Please have some while it's hot! This dish is made by the famous Fuxing Garden in town, and the taste is quite good."</p>
<p>Mr. Ye was puffing on his water pipe, and hearing Mayor Chen say this, he began to talk about the dishes with him. The other guests were still talking about the military situation with Commander Ye. Yang Yueliang asked if there would be any danger to the future of Hepu Town if the war approached. Commander Ye said,</p>
<p>"There are no railways or highways here, and transportation is inconvenient. It won't matter when the war first approaches, but it's hard to say what will happen later." (4)</p>

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3 id="e142">Wu Peifu Discusses Entertainment <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>It is really not appropriate to judge people too early.</p>
<p>For example, certain parties spread many rumors about Wu Peifu, which were published in newspapers, making him seem unfathomable. But what about now? Everything has been overturned by the facts. Wu Peifu not only did not take office as the president of any puppet government, but after resolutely refusing, he issued a statement expressing his patriotic spirit.</p>
<p>Wu has such high moral character and integrity, entirely due to the influence of history. He admires Yue Fei, and he praises Guan Yu even more. His major words, aspirations, and actions are entirely modeled after Guan and Yue; even in minor details, it seems that he would not speak or act unless based on what Guan and Yue said and did, as if that were not enough to comfort himself.</p>
<p>He once said: "Confucius's Six Arts are 'rituals,' 'music,' 'archery,' 'charioteering,' 'writing,' and 'arithmetic.' Although he advocated entertainment, his intention was to infuse education into entertainment. I am very happy to learn the Six Arts. My view on entertainment is to avoid causing chaos in one's nature, which is also what the ancients called cultivating one's character. But today's people, especially those young fellows who grow up in big cities, do they know what the Six Arts are? Their 'rituals' are ballroom dancing; hugging women and kissing; shaking hands with people and saying hello; their 'music' is 'Dance Partner's Song'; 'Sister, I Love You'; 'Peach Blossom River'; jazz in the dance hall; in short, the world has changed, and the future of the young fellows is truly frightening."</p>
<p>In recent years, Wu has been living in seclusion in Beiping. When he is bored, he always finds an acquaintance to play chess or Go with, quietly playing, often spending the whole afternoon. Sometimes, he raises his voice and sings a scene from "Wu Family Slope," or "Sitting in the Palace," or "Scolding Cao," but because of his age, his breathing is inevitably insufficient. When he cannot stretch out the tail notes, he complains to himself. "I'm old after all, useless." Then he bursts into a fit of laughter.</p>
<p>Before going to bed, he plays a game of Wu Guan, divining good and bad fortune. After getting up early, he does a set of small boxing, rests for a moment, and then enters the study. He either composes poems, paints, or studies "Spring and Autumn," so that he can assimilate himself with the words and actions of the "Spring and Autumn."</p>
<h3 id="e143">On "Mulan Joins the Army" <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Mei</p>
<p>On this isolated island full of strangeness, everything seems a bit abnormal, especially the entertainment industry, which is becoming increasingly monstrous, obscene, and drifting with the tide. It not only fails to talk about correct consciousness, but also betrays its own mission, always drilling into a dead end. How heartbreaking that is! Recently, South China film star Chen Yunshang was hired to come to Shanghai to film the historical drama "Mulan Joins the Army," which is currently being filmed and will be released during the Lunar New Year. We hope that the filmmakers will not focus too much on business and repeat this mistake!</p>
<p>The story of "Mulan Joins the Army" is very simple, but the consciousness is relatively healthy. If interspersed properly, it may not be an excellent script to inspire people's morale. In the past, Ms. Li Xiaqing, who is now famous in the aviation world, also starred in "Mulan Joins the Army," but the filmmakers, in order to maintain history too much, ignored reality, and even fell into the path of mystery and inflexibility, making the audience only feel its antique charm, and the result was a failure. Therefore, the filming of "Mulan Joins the Army" this time should at least not ignore this point.</p>
<p>Secondly, how tragic it is for Hua Mulan, a weak woman, to join the army on behalf of her father. Therefore, we don't have to think that Hua Mulan must be a lithe and chivalrous heroine who can gallop on the battlefield and kill enemies. It is because of the oppression of the enemy and even more inspired by righteous indignation that she had to resolutely join the army on behalf of her father, abandoning powder boxes and rouge, stopping the loom and embroidery, and unexpectedly changed her dress for armor. "She left the Yellow River in the morning and arrived at the Blackwater Head in the evening," engaging in a battlefield life of bullets and smoke. Here, we can expose the evils of war as much as possible, and it is also enough to grasp the audience's sympathy.</p>
<p>The final passage of Mulan's Ballad has "The male hare kicks its feet, the female hare squints, when two hares run side by side, how can you tell if I am male or female?" These sentences of description are no less than a symbol that this year's zodiac is the rabbit, making people feel that regardless of men and women, they all have a generous responsibility to join the army. Moreover, it is said that although Ms. Chen Yunshang is rich in oriental classical beauty, she cannot hide her strong posture, which is indeed valuable. We hope that Ms. Chen can not only maintain her past glory in this drama, but also hope that she will make a more glorious contribution, to sweep away the demons and refresh people's eyes and ears.</p>

<p>— Tang Bihua</p>
<p>Now that you have bought the time slot and started broadcasting, you must stipulate the time. Regardless of wind and rain, heavy snow, you must rush to the radio station to do that mechanical work, just like a singer going on stage, you can't miss the show; if you are late, the ruthless reporter will report it, "□□□ has not arrived yet, please listen to the record." Sometimes, if you have a cold, cough, or sore throat, it is simply fatal. It is like a mute eating coptis chinensis, an unspeakable bitterness. If you ask someone to substitute for you, the store you are broadcasting for will often permanently replace you, so once a broadcaster has a disease, unless he asks his own student to substitute for him, he would rather ask the radio station to play a record than ask someone to substitute for him. Some radio stations are on the fifth floor of the hotel. If you encounter an important matter and delay the time, you rush to the radio station, but it happens that the elevator breaks down, which is deadly. Breathlessly running up to the fifth floor, you can't catch your breath, and you can't speak into the microphone. The ruthless audience is there to call and question: "□□□ hasn't arrived yet?" Alas! Everything is difficult because it is difficult to eat. Once you fall into it, you complain about one line, but who told you to drill into the broadcasting circle?</p>
<p>The first thing in broadcasting is to have clear pronunciation and a sharp mind. The radio station has rules, and sentences related to politics and harmful to social morals are absolutely prohibited, so you must be careful everywhere. If you are not careful, you will cause problems, and the lyrics you broadcast must be constantly changed. If you always sing these old tunes, you will be said to be rehashing old news, and there is nothing new. It is much cheaper to come up with a few new patterns if you can use your brain and write, but it is miserable if you can't write, so you have to pay someone to write for you, and you can't get good stuff.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Huang San, Liu Chunjin, and Xiu Shan were all amateurs</p>
<p>(Daoban) This ruthless club almost killed me (Liushui) Only beat the old hero with blood dripping. Thinking of that year, Sui Wendi Taidong conquered the west. Killed Yin Baihu to get An Ning. I hate Cao thief, who occupied ninety-nine and eighty-one counties. Greedy and not enough, he fought with Dongwu. My Dongwu civil officials want to surrender, but the military generals don't want their lives. There is a Zhou governor who leads the team to fight. Set a clever plan to kill Cai Mao and Zhang Yun. Cai Zhong. With Cai He. Came to pretend to surrender, but I saw through the situation. I, Huang Gai, used the bitter plan. A great man, meets a confidant, what is the joy of life, what is the fear of death, even if he is liver and brain coated on the ground, bones broken into pieces, it is difficult to repay Wu Hou's three generations of kindness. The soldiers helped me into the tent (Sanban) The whole body aches and I can't sit or lie down.</p>
<p>The above lyrics are indeed not easy to sing. I have also heard an old Henan amateur, Liu Xiaoxian, sing the Liushui Ban of "The Chain Scheme", which contains "Suddenly the ant soldiers reported a letter, he reported that the city of Beijing was covered with yellow soil and hung with red lanterns, and every household decorated with colored silk. Someone asked him why he hung the lanterns? He said that he was ordered to surround the hunting Liang Jiugong, and the Holy Emperor gave him a horse to walk the dragon, and he will sit in the Gathering Hall and explain clearly to the others." In addition, Liu sang Fan Erhuang of "Wang Jian Reconnoitering the Camp," but unfortunately I only remember one sentence of Daoban "In the army, the order is like a thunder," and I did not copy down the complete lyrics from Liu, which is a great regret. The day before yesterday, Mr. Jiang Zicheng also asked me, is it true that the painted face sings a large section of Fan Erhuang? I said that I heard it with my own ears 20 years ago, what else is fake? It can be seen that the current world of actors is too lacking in talent, and they are not willing to humbly ask for advice, so that many good tunes and lyrics have been lost, which is really too regrettable. My home still has Jin Xiushan's "Black Basin", "Assassination of King Liao", "Famen Temple", "Muhu Guan" and other records, which were all recorded by the old Moteli Company decades ago, and they are no longer available for sale outside. Whenever Jin Shaoshan comes to my house, he always asks to open it and listen to it once or twice. I said to him: Based on the friendship between the two of us, I would like to give you a few records of your father, so that you can hear your father's posthumous sounds from time to time, so that you can work hard to improve; secondly, you can also take him as a model to increase your acting skills. But my consistent purpose is to specialize in preserving the national essence. All national culture, drama, old records of the actor world, old photos, and relics of famous actors, etc., I have collected them all, and I plan to display them in the "National Theatre Exhibition Hall" in the future for the audience to listen to. Therefore, it cannot be transferred to you. However, what I especially allow you is that as long as you come, I can make an exception and open it for you to listen; because a record can be opened and listened to at most a hundred times, so I usually don't open many old records for people to listen to unless they are confidants.</p>
