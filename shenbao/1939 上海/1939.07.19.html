<p>社評</p>
<h3 id="c10">論黑滙巿價 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>自六月七日上午起，上上海黑匯市塲，爲欲覓取新水準而劇變；英匯自八辦士四分之一，美匯自十六元三十二分之三，經兩日之盤旋，英匯定於六辦士十六分之九，美匯定於十二元三十二分之二十五，迄今而時歷四旬，隔昨銀行拒用華北鈔票，黑匯市塲昨日又起驚人之縮風，英匯縮至五辦士二五，美匯以十元二五收盤，較之四旬以來之市價，英匯縮一辦士三一二五，美匯縮兩元五三一二五，此又所謂黑匯新水準非歟？</p>
<p>外匯一再緊縮，自有其事實上當然之因果，存乎其間，未宜以何種理論爲標準而評隲之；雖然，此所造就之事實影響，亦有不可忽者焉，先就此决緊縮之動因言之，由於華北鈔票之洪流；華北鈔票備受政治與經濟之兩種外力壓迫，於是津滬間幣値有二五之差，英滙有兩辦士之異，而成爲牟利者絕好絕大之機會；不予應付，損害將不堪設想；顧限用北鈔與緊縮匯價之結果如何？津滬市價似收接近之效，然幣値因流通之限制而別有鴻溝，外滙以黑市之自由買賣而旁流如故。可見四旬以來之限制提現，限用北鈔，以及一再緊縮滙價，皆僅末節而已，非可視爲有關國計民生之偉略也，何也，事實上不足以塞外滙漏巵，此可注意者一也。</p>
<p>在此金融市塲演變之中，金融界之所以適應之者，則推行匯劃也，限制提現也，發行新匯劃證也，準備金之准貼現也，周轉固不患無術；至於殷富，則旣未足消釋其資金逃避之企圖，亦未足堵塞其逃避資金之蹊徑，而此輩所買存之外幣黃金，反而因外匯一再緊縮而作會心之微笑，蓋不勞而獲，財富倍計矣。獨於正當工商業與一般民生，雖欲强顏爲歡，亦有不可得者。或曰，工商業何傷，水漲則船高，成本重，則售價可貴；不觀夫昨日外匯驟縮，而黃金棉紗，生豆油，五金，呢絨，洋糖，烟白煤，無一而不在昂頭直進，於是觀之，工商界非但無所損，甚且有意外之利潤焉。雖然，此知其一，不知其二，祗見近利，未見遠慮之說也。要知影響所至：一以成本旣重，所凍結之資金亦重，二以物價旣高，終必削弱一般購買力，三則貨物壅滯，四則生產减少；凡此顯明之事理，有其必然之後惡；乃謂無損工商百業而爲其福乎？此可注意者二也。</p>
<p>曷更檢視百業現象乎：今日以機械工業自然發展之結果，所需材料，不能完全自給；例如紡紗之需美棉印棉參用也；又如報館所用捲筒報紙及鑄字合金油墨之屬，皆待進口也；他如文化事業所需之紙張，儀器，文具，製版，化學藥品，物理器械，國內胥無適當之供給，取材異國者比比也。今中央掛牌，雖仍維持英滙一先令兩辦士半，美金三十元之滙率；但紗廠報館學校等等，所需外滙，惟有求之於黑市；夫不得於法價者一，而不得不由黑市外流者所耗幾乎三倍其値，此誠無可如何之事實，而大可注意者三也。</p>
<p>至於一般民生，失業者亦需生活，孤寡之賴薄產者亦需生活，是姑勿論；即以薪工階級言之，收入有其定量，縱爲物價高漲，而所屬之行號廠肆尚能及時增加工資之十一二，然仍不足以挹注上漲奇速之生活所必需。此誠非常時期之非常現象，爲人民所必須忍受；况關個人生活之各個問題，人民自應各自圖謀應付，不應重貽國族之憂；然事實上所生之直接間接影響，我人亦有應爲整個社會而注意者四也。</p>
<p>昨論限用華北鈔票，一面乃有助長「聯鈔」之觀，今於限用北鈔之後，繼以再縮滙價，而「聯鈔」市價昨竟劇漲至於每一百零一元便得換取法幣一百；彼市價最低之際，固祇及法幣六七折也。此其原因，不止一端，而應付之道，要以維持法幣信用爲本。不若是而惟枝枝節節以應付之，不但爲效至小至暫，抑且損失與禍患踵至。試檢視兩月以來之種種現象，輒有不忍言而不可諱者，是待財政當局察人心之機微，而多多注意於事實者五也。</p>
<p>凡右所陳，吾人懍於諱疾之戒，爰作逆耳之言。至於對症下藥之詳密方案，期諸專家，而比較積極之措施，竊意還在本報屢加論列之取締上海黑滙市塲。夫黑市有其來因，取締有所爲難；則以爲最可研求者，一在國家財政與社會經濟之問，一在事實與人心之間，一在百業最高度之自力生存與最低度之生存條件之間；三者各有其本體，各有所偏重，顧其生滅消長，互爲因果，不可偏廢，不可疎忽，而必兼籌並顧者也。今日之癥結在黑市，取締黑市自非易事，但在兼籌並顧之原則與信念之下，則必有應爲於黑市者。</p>

<p>但澤　半官機關「但澤前鋒報」今日發表社評、討論但澤問題、略謂、「柏林官塲人士對英相張伯倫最近就但澤市問題所發表之演說、雖持緘默態度、但英法兩國報章咸以爲德國似有進行談判之意、例如倫教「泰晤士報」與巴黎「斐茄洛報」最近社評曾謂、但澤市報章論調、最近一週來似已趨於緩和、按此說絕非事實、但澤市國社黨領袖孚斯德日前往謁德元首希特勒、即足證明但澤市人民之信念、未見動搖、德國現決不對波蘭政府再提已被拒絕之建議、波蘭境內反德運動存在一日、即一日無進行談判之可能」云、（十八日海通電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　柏林各報載稱、德英兩國或將請求義相墨索里尼、爲但澤自由市問題出面調處、此間政界人士均未之置信、並謂但澤市現行制度、可吾修改、其决定之權、操諸波蘭、德國倘願與波蘭直接進行談判、則門戶現仍洞啟、加之、波國聞願與德國重新討論增進貿易事宜、則於商務談話開始之後、進一步而討論但澤問題、自非難事、關於此層、德國各報有主德波商務談話、可於八月十日開始者、英國方面聞悉之餘、頗感興趣、以爲德國或不擬因但澤問題引起危機、此在波蘭態度堅决、不願作何讓步、觀於梵諦岡敎廷曾擬出面調處、均爲波國政府所拒絕、可以見矣云、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>但澤　但澤市當局今日正式說明態度、謂多年以來、但澤國社黨政策與德國完全一致、故但澤之命運、操於希特勒元首手中、關於倫敦報章所傳、但澤將獨自進行談判、以解決但澤及走廊問題之說、此間認爲完全無稽、據但澤市情報主任接見外籍訪員稱、但澤一般之企望、係與國社政策相合、而與波蘭希望但澤勿與德國合併一事、適巧相反云、（十八日海通電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　柏林各報近日對於但澤問題及莫斯科談判、均持極緘默態度、因此德國態度如何、殊難揣測、似乎柏林對於上述兩項問題、故意保守秘密、另人莫測高深云、（八日海通電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）　關於英法蘇三國賡續進行談判一事、此間小巴黎人報」宣稱、莫斯科談判現時尙有兩重困難、（一）萬一波羅的海各國促進對德關係、則蘇俄堅持之保證、將引起糾紛、（二）蘇聯主張立即開始三國參謀談話、但英法兩國僉認爲必簽訂公的、然後始能洩露軍事秘密云、（十八日海通社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　關於英法蘇聯三國當局現所進行之談判、官塲方面雖拒不加以評論，但消息靈通人士宣、英法兩國代表曾將各該國政府所採立塲再度加以說明、莫洛托夫當即允向本國政府請示辦法云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>甘蘭君　天津人，後起之秀、能抽能守、態度大方、打球姿勢美觀、惜經騐略差、今日二戰如能全勝、尙有季軍希望、</p>

<p>金融巿塲於前日停兌華北地名鈔票之後、詎料昨又發生巨浪、蓋為防止某方套取外滙及鞏固法幣計、滙巿乃見劇烈緊縮、滙豐銀行於上午九時一刻許、掛牌即見在縮、開盤英滙爲五辦士半、美滙爲十元又五六二五、第二次掛牌叉縮、計英滙爲五辦士、美滙爲九元七五、與前日掛牌、英滙價六辦士半、美滙價十二元六二五相較、計英滙猛縮一辦士半、美滙縮達美金二元八七五之鉅、於是市塲頓見紊亂、嗣後英滙暗市、亦縮至五辦士二五、盤旋於五辦士半至五辦士左右、下午則穩定於五辦士二五之價、美滙上午價在十元至十元二五之間、下午則亦站住十元二五之價、</p>
<p>隨外滙猛縮、首先遭受影響者、厥為現金巿塲、上午烚赤開盤、即告猛漲、開盤價為三千元、與前日收盤價二千六百十九元賴較、計漲三百八十一元、全日最高會達三千一百元、最低爲二千九百〇八元、全日上落、相差達一百二十元、爲近日之巨變、收盤價爲三千〇五十五元、</p>
<p>由於外滙猛縮、現金飛漲之後、一般人民、懷疑法幣信用、外商股票及債券需要乃告驟殷、交易增多、各股票均告上漲、怡和紗廠股票最高曾至二十元〇二角、與前日最高價十八元一角比較、計漲二元一角、電話公司股票成交價爲十二元八角、亦較前日漲起數角、滙劃貼現暗盤、亦激漲二十八元五角、價爲一百三十餘元、</p>
<p>關於外埠滙兌行市、香港對英美無甚變動、對上海前日收盤、申滙每港紙百元、合法幣二百二十五元六二五、至昨日已升至二百七十五元、計上升達五十元左右、天津滙兌行市、昨日開盤英滙爲四辦士、與十七日比較、計縮·九〇六二五辦士、美滙價七元七五、計縮美金一元八一二五、津滬滙兌價爲一百三十元、反較前日降三元、「聯銀券」價爲一百〇一元、（即法幣一百元合該劵之價）、與十七日價一百〇四元半此較、計昂三元五角、若與六月三十日價一百十二元比較、則貴達十一元矣、至於物價方面、凡棉紗布疋食糖五金油類煤炭等等、無一不見劇烈上升云</p>

<p>倫敦十八日電、今日中國法幣之暴跌、其立即原因爲中英平準基金委員會之停售英鎊、使倫敦對於中國法幣之交易幾至枯竭、此間銀行以爲彼等未便冒隔夜波動之危險而購進大批法幣、故法幣成交者僅偶有小數、大都爲由中國提出之款、惟英人之執有中國法幣者、大都以暫將此款留於中國、以待滙率好轉爲宜、而不願目前折爲英鎊、致受重大損失、倫敦各銀行聲明不願援助不利於中國貨幣之缺方投機家、因此種行爲、將愈挫弱平準基金之力量也、此間中英金融家雖認中國法幣必須自覓其匯兌水準、然皆甚以目前之暴落爲異、至於何者始爲中國法幣之水準、則爲一般人猜測之事、其究竟如何、大半將視「中國事件」之政治上與經濟上趨向而定、（路透社）</p>
<p>上海黑市塲外匯、經外匯平準基金管理委員會維持後、英商滙豐銀行對於各業正當需要、仍予盡量供給、於是黑市外匯穩定於所謂新水平綫、即英匯六便士半、美匯十二元六二五、今爲防止鉅額套買起見、不得不酌予限制供給、因此上海黑市外滙、昨起狂縮、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>外匯黑市昨晨狂縮</p>
<p>昨晨九時、英商匯豐銀行之外滙掛脾、（即所謂黑市外滙價格）英滙縮爲五便士半、美滙縮爲十元六八七五、至十時、第二决掛牌、英滙又縮爲五便士、美滙又縮爲九元七五、同時匯豐．麥加利．花旗等行對請求購買外匯、限制甚爲嚴格、凡正常商人欲申請購買者、必需以訂貨者爲憑、吾則均予拒絕購買、</p>
<p>限制供給市塲混亂</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、過去上海外滙黑市、幸賴外匯平準基金管理委員會之維持、使能依然穩定於新水平綫、今因爲防止非法套買上海黑市外匯、不得不於昨晨起酌予限制、並非停止供給、上海黑市外匯、自英商滙豐銀行嚴格限制供給後、投機者乘機放謠、以致外滙黑市、異常混亂、一時扒結者接踵而起</p>
<p>正當需要仍予供給</p>
<p>後來匯豐等銀行對正當需要者、仍予儘量供給、於是市塲人心稍安、外匯價格轉鬆、結果站在英滙五便士二五、美匯十元二五、聞黑市之外匯、或將穩定於上述行市、並有人謂此即謂又一新水平錢、又上海黑市之外匯、本不應再予維持而平準外匯基金委員會仍予設法維持、僅予限制供給旨在顧念商艱、</p>
<p>法定滙價始終不變</p>
<p>財政部自公佈進口物品申請外匯規則後、凡非禁止之進口必需品、均得向重慶外匯審核委員會申請購買外滙、由中交兩行按照法定供給、但申請人須繳納按法價與中交兩行掛牌價格差額之平衡費、所以此後凡必需品之進口、母須再向黑市購買、至於中央銀行之法定外匯價格、始終不變、例如昨日所公佈者、英匯一先令二便士半、美滙三十美元、</p>
<p>防止套買禁貨進口</p>
<p>關於淪陷區域各海關，如上海．天津．等、因政府權力不及、禁止進口貨品辦法、無法實行、所以奢侈品以及非必需品、仍得山淪陷區域各關進口、供給淪陷區域民衆消費、但是項進口貨之外滙、必須向上海及天津等處黑市購買、此决香港方面再行限制上海黑市外滙之供給、實爲防止某方之套購、以及奢侈品之運口、</p>
<p>舶來貨品價格飛漲</p>
<p>外滙　黑市價格旣暴縮、咋日舶來品、如紙．糖藥品．顏料．皂燭·油脂．菸草．洋酒·等價均飛漲二三成不等、而一般經營洋貨之商人、均不允大批出售、同時國產各貨、竟亦隨之高漲、又造成滬市物價之崎形現象、投機份子乘機囤積國貨、以圖厚利、平民生計、大受影響、故希望各業切勿任意抬高物價、</p>
<p>現金飛漲滙劃貼水</p>
<p>現金暗市、昨因黑市外滙狂縮、以致現市飛漲、竟破三千元大關、造成空前之新高價、爲黃金有史以來絕未曾有、各銀樓掛牌、亦提高至三百十元、關於滙劃貼水、雖爲不正當營業、迭經政府命令取締、而一般小錢兌莊、仍違抗命令、經營貼水、昨日因一般需要現鈔套買外滙囤積貨物、市塲上求過於供、貼水竟漲至一百三十五元、</p>

<p>英文大美晚報云、香港中英平準基金委員會今日（十八日）電令滙豐與麥加利兩銀行對以法幣預購或現購外匯、停止出售中日貨幣戰遂更進一步、平準基令委員會此一新的防衛辦法、今晨上海已深感其影響、法幣匯値自六便士五之水準跌至五便士、晨九時、英匯爲五便士、美匯爲九元七五、質言之、即美金一元合法幣九元七角五分、英金一鎊合四十八元是、而今晨之最低價値、爲四便士九三七五、旋投機者與出口商略有售出、結果、市塲稍趨堅定、匯率升至五便士、與十元七五、然外國銀行大都僅虛掛行市、除其顧客外、對他人拒不出售、致匯率復跌至開盤水準、午刻、匯率返至五便士三一二五、與十元三七五、</p>
<p>法幣匯値旣復降落、若非回返此前之水準、則預料最近激漲之上海物價、此後數日內將漲至更高之水準、昨日天津之英匯、僅四便士七五、日方銀行與其他投機者、若能用華北發行之法幣在本埠市塲上獲得外匯、必可獲利什三、受其損失者爲政府銀行及其匯兌準備金、昨日（十七日）上海已因大量提供</p>
<p>華北紙幣而感緊壓、多數華方銀行遂拒收印有天津·靑島．濟南與山東等地名之任何紙幣、本埠日元匯率未獲法幣匯價低落之利、且間接使其易外幣之價値跌落、兌換店以法幣一元買進日元、而以一元一角售出之、與昨日之匯率、幾無變動、十盎期金條之價格、今晨達三千一百元</p>
<p>最高水準黑市開盤爲三千元、旋至空前高價三千一百元、收盤爲三千零四十元、今晨衆知銀行所發津鈔可易本埠紙幣、擁擠於靜安寺路交通分行者不下二百人、管理基金之停售外匯除華北諸行之紙幣傾銷於本埠市塲爲其一因外、據七海令融界稱、其另一原因爲六月份第二週所</p>
<p>創新匯率其低尙不足使預購外匯者氣餒、在此等情勢下、香港基金感覺宜復行停售外匯、至少若干時任上海匯市覍得法幣易外幣之新的自然水準、今晨之匯市完全杌隍不定、無疑的香港基金遲早將復干涉而恢復對法幣出售外匯、然無人敢預言何時將</p>
<p>不加限制而恢復出售外匯、或將否實施僅對某數種指定入口品出售外匯、日方企圖在滬將巨量華北法幣易成外匯、似屬平準會今晨拒絕出售之直接原因、聞諸可靠方面、日方銀行已自天津運來華北法幣、不下五千萬元、願以任何價値易取外匯、</p>

<p>上海市塲各銀行錢莊以及公司行號烟兌店等、前日起拒收天津等處華北地名之鈔票後、昨晨起持華北地名之中交兩行鈔票、向中國交通兩銀行兌換者甚多、該兩行當局因此决限制收受華北地名鈔票、旨在防止搬運來滬套買外匯、故對門市零星少數、已儘量通融兌換、故凡持一百元以下者、悉予兌換上海地名之法幣、並增派人員、帮助辦理兌換事宜、</p>
<p>其他雜鈔照常行使</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向關係方面探悉、自財政部統一發行後、設發行準備管理委昌會管理之、其發行準備之現金、始終在百分之六十以上、巳深得中外人士之信仰、關於浙江興業·四行之中南．中國墾業．中國實業．中國農工．浙江地方．農商．等銀行所發行之鈔票、均由發行準備管理委員會接管、故是項鈔票、已與法幣同樣行使、又華北地名以外、如漢口．浙江．浙蘇．等地名鈔票、各行莊仍照常收受、</p>
<p>滬行已電總行請示</p>
<p>此次中國交通兩銀行之限制兌換華北地名鈔票、係暫時性質、乃臨時之緊急處置、業已由兩分行電總行請示辦法、俟復電指示辦法後即行遵辦、惟爲安定市面起見、昨日起對零星少數、已儘量兌換、聞昨日兩行共兌進華北地名之鈔票總的二十萬元、今晨起決繼續收兌、凡正當商人、雖持百元以上之華北地名鈔票、亦予通融兌換、</p>
<p>中交兩行擬議辦法</p>
<p>中國交通兩行上海分行經副理、於昨日曾作非正式之會商、聞將籌劃妥善辦法、惟是項辦法、須俟總行核准後實行、據新聲社記者向關係方面探悉、此後凡持外省地名之鈔票、欲向中交等行兌換者、祗准兌給一元券、因一元劵購買外匯、手續上頗感不便、外商銀行對於鉅額之一元券、亦不允收受、旨在使其無法套買外匯、</p>
<p>黑市購滙限中中交</p>
<p>又新聲社記者昨向洋商銀行探悉、外灘各洋商銀行、如匯豐麥加利．花旗．　行、對於收受鈔票、早以中央中國交通三行之法幣爲限、外埠地名之鈔票、以及其他各行之鈔、早已不予收受、故欲在上海黑市塲套買外匯者、必需用中中交三行之法幣、所以華北地名之鈔票、欲向滬黑市購買外匯、必需事前掉成上海地名之三行法幣、</p>
<p>華北鈔票運滬套滙</p>
<p>余融市塲或傳有鉅額天津等華北地名之鈔票、由天津裝專輪行將抵滬、總數有三四千萬元之鉅、企圖向上海外匯黑市套買外匯、因天津之外匯、自該地淪陷後、中國政府已不予維持、所以匯價低落、英匯縮至四元許、美滙縮至九元、同時上海天津兩地之匯水、天津一千三百餘元、祗合上海一千元、故津地鈔票之運滬、其獲利之厚、勝於貨物、</p>
<p>小錢莊竟收買牟利</p>
<p>向以經營投機爲業之非錢兌業公會之小錢莊、竟乘中交兩行限制兌換華北地名鈔票之際、私自收買外埠地名之鈔票、每元貼水一角至三角不等、收得是項鈔票後、再飭學徒向中交兩行兌換、旨在牟利、是項不正當營業、望持票人切勿受其愚、因此决中交之臨時限制兌換、係爲防止搬運套匯、是項鈔票、決無問題、</p>

<p>吾國人民之知識水準過於低下，社會有種種劣習，醞釀日久，國勢積弱，遂有今日之國難。爲正本淸源之計，以便當此危急之秋，增强國家之實力，並可於大局安定之後，謀國家永久之發展者，惟有以科學常識灌輸於人民，將腐舊窳敗之社會，澈底改造，俾有日新月異之氣象，實今日愛國之靑年，人人所宜努力者也。吾國社會之退化，皆因缺乏科學常識之故。如人民之迷信鬼神，求仙問卜之事，仍然風行於國內，每年香燭鞭炮錫箔楮錢等費，幾至數千萬元。以國家鉅大之資源，徒供無謂之消耗，旣斵喪共國力，復貽笑於外人，使人民均有科學之常識，則此等損失可以遞减以至於無。人民之不知衛生，不喜潔淨，旣易使病疫之蔓延；膳食喜用白米礱舂過細，犧牲營養之質料，不知配合經濟平衡之食物，其體力漸瀕於衰弱。而無識村農與鄉曲富戶，又喜子女早婚，因先天之不足，甚至整個民族皆有孱萎之趨勢。使有科學常識，則知此等盲行，足貽害於共身以及共國，人民當相戒而不敢犯。又人民因無知識，其謀生之技能及爲人之道德，乃墮落日茶。不健全之國民旣多，在國競方急之世，國家勢必受其累。使科學常識能深入民間，一人民怵於物競天擇之不可逃，相率奮勵，以求生存，其人生觀必甚正確，人人爲負責之國民，國家自無內憂與外患。以上數點，皆其最顯著者。其實因科學之不發達，國家社會所受之害，不知凡幾也。觀乎此，可知欲立國家長久之基，必賴於社會之改進。欲改進社會，唯望國內有志之靑年，致力於科學，將科學常識足以鍼砭社會之痼疾者，盡量宣傳於人。雖今日萬分危迫，而其足以鞏因國家之元氣，促進人民之責任心與奮鬥之力者，至爲偉大。願愛國之士，勿以此爲迂緩之圖，而急趨直追，力排萬難，爲改良社會之先鋒。</p>
<h3 id="c109">第一名生物 <a href="#c109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— 郭錫管</p>
<p>生命現象，有如燭燄，外有常形，內則變動不居。此變動可自兩方面觀察，一爲建設（Anabolism），一爲破壞（Katabolism）。攝取外界物質，以造成體質，是爲建設；分解體質，排出體外，是爲破壊；合稱新陳代謝（Metabolism）。無論建設或破壊，均係工作（Ｗork）。工作須賴能力（Energy），始得完成。生命現象即能力之表現。破壊時之能力,來自體內之靜能（Potential　Energy）。此靜能又係生物在行建設作用時攝取外界動能（Kinitio　Energy)轉變儲藏而成者。</p>
<p>從攝取能力方面言，生物可分兩大類。一爲依附，一爲獨立。獨立類如綠色植物，能攝取外界之動能－日光，轉變爲　能而儲藏之。依附類如動物及無葉綠素植物等則不能。故葉綠　實爲固定動能之一要具。生物具此，則能獨立生存，不然則營依附生活。然土壊中有數種細菌，如硝化菌，鐵細菌，硫黃菌…等，各能利用氮化物，鐵化物，硫化物…等，在氧化時所發散之能力，以製造食物，且將其動能固定而備藏之，以待破壊時之用。故此等細菌，雖無葉綠素，實能獨立生存。</p>
<p>根據進化論，現存地球之各種生物，皆由簡單者進化而來。生物之最小單位爲細胞，無論如何簡單，至少應有一細胞。故最先在地球發生之生物，應爲單細胞生物。經長時間之淘汰進化，今日之地球巳爲高等生物所主宰。但單細胞生物如前述之細菌等，在今世仍有甚多之種類及數目，生物學者且爲之闢專科以深切硏究。吾人巳知現存之生物俱係單細胞生物進化而來。雖不能遽謂最先在地球發生之生物，即是現存之某一種單細胞生物，然就現存之芸芸異類中，推論出一種極有在原始時代「第一次」發生可能者，當屬極有興趣之問題。</p>
<p>吾人須知，最有在原始時代發生可能之生物，當爲營獨立生活者，故動物決不是地球上第一生物。高等植物雖有葉綠素，能獨立生存，但其構造複雜，謂爲第一生物，不合進化原則。現存之單細胞生物除藻類及前述之少數細菌外，大多營寄生（Parasite）或寄腐（Saprophyte)生活，此等生物當然不能爲第一生物。藻類雖有葉綠素，能獨立生存，但其細胞中巳有顯明之細胞核，當較細菌高等，自亦不能爲第一名生物。至細胞中只有顆粒狀之染色質（Chromatin），尙未結成核狀，毫無進化痕跡者，前述三細菌庶乎近是。硫鐵之存量不及氮素（Nitrgen）之多且普遍，空中遊離氮素如是之多，太古時，日光隨時有使合成氮化物之可能。此氮化物在分解時，發生能力，硝化菌適能利用。適者生存，故證本窮源，謂硝化菌爲一切生物之前輩，殆不爲過歟？</p>

<p>近十年來各國玻璃製造廠對於玻璃之研究有長足進步。現在玻璃之用途，不但爲門窗，器皿，和光學儀器，且已成爲重要之建築材料，用以造牆壁，地板，桌椅，甚至汽車之框架。在另一方面，又將玻璃造成織物原料，與棉花絲蔴同一用途。此次紐約世界博覽會中有種種關於玻璃製造新進展之展覽品，頗引起一般人之重大興趣。圖示一種英國新出品玻璃板，可彎曲。可扭轉，熱之不裂，擊之不破，强而柔韌，」如鋼片。圖中之板雖僅有八分之三英寸厚，竟能支起一人之重，亦可見其强韌之一斑矣。</p>
<h3 id="c111">一根香烟 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 橋下客</p>
<p>報載國府通令全國人民厲行節的運動。末後並令戒絕一切消耗，少飲酒少吸烟云云。於是香烟只好一根，以符通令。雖然最高限度是一根香烟，但也表示了人生的片面，在這螺絲殼式的道塲裏邊，有沒有科學廻旋的餘地呢？有！而且舉國的香燜同志都可與我一同廻旋，以極小極簡的手續，來訓練推論的步驟，當然，如果表演得不好，咎在我一人。同志們姑試試看啵；</p>
<p>第一，燃着香烟，吸上一口。我們發見口中吐出之烟爲灰白色，烟頭上昇之烟爲淡藍色而夾有少許灰白烟縷。不同之故何在？我們不妨回答，口內是潤濕的，烟氣加上濕氣，顏色就變了。那麼何以烟尾自行冒出之烟仍是灰白的呢？回答是烟尾給口水弄濕了。何以剪去濕處之後仍出白烟呢？某君考慮之後說道，烟絲本來含有濕氣的，另有一位抗聲說道，不不，烟氣經過烟卷時，溫度顯然要降低若干，烟氣中某部物質冷凝而呈灰白色。好罷，欲待解決，再來一套。</p>
<p>第二，左手執一濕淋淋的玻璃杯，杯口向下，右手將香烟對準杯口，相距的五寸或六寸（不可凑近）。我們看靑烟裊裊直上，一都份透入杯內。如果香烟的烟氣因濕而白，或遇冷凝結而白，照理杯內的烟氣應該變白，然而杯內的烟並不變白，從杯內冒出之烟亦復青靑如也。由此可見兩君所說雖都是言之有理的，無奈還不是白烟的主要原因。我們得更來一套。</p>
<p>第三，就在前面的佈置之下，我們將香烟凑近杯口，或略進杯內。結果是白烟瀰漫，同從口內噴出的一樣了。如果觀察時間較久，香烟漸漸熄滅</p>
<p>試作解釋：香烟與杯口距離的變更，能影響到烟氣之靑與白，而杯內杯外之不同處在空氣流動範圍的大小，那麼，空氣容易流動的地方，空氣的補充也容易，燃燒起來容易燒盡；空氣不容易流動的地方，空氣的補充也不容易，燃燒起來不容易燒盡；於是我們不妨假定，白烟是比較的未曾燒盡的物質所成的。該項物質籠罩香烟頭，香烟就熄滅。然而某君責問道：我們吸烟並不放在玻璃杯內吸的，是在空氣流通的大自然中吸的，何以也會有白烟？這一問非但不能推翻我們的假定，且證實了另外一種事實的存在。原來就在空氣流通的地方，用平常方法來燃燒，總有未曾燒盡的物質產生，燃燒的範圍越大，該項物質的產生越多。所以在吸香烟，頓使白烟陣陣如霧，停住不吸，白烟轉漸漸的减少了。試想生火爐的時候必先燃紙，能立時化爲烏有吧？不能。有白烟冒出來吧？有的。</p>
<p>香烟同志何妨繼續試試，當然「一根」兩字是要動搖的了。不過，如果有新假定，把我的罵得狗屁不値，這就是科學進步，好極了的。至於要問靑烟白烟在成份上哦何區別，在比重上或烟粒的大小上相差若干，這是要使硏究院裏的硏究員都忙碌起來，非左手執杯右手拿烟所能解決。</p>

<h3 id="c115">文壇上的「繳械法」 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— 靑侯</p>
<p>文壇上也眞有一些過分儒雅的人和過分熱心的人，前一種人善於皺眉，後一種人善於大呌，他們總是看不慣文壇上的現狀，總是在旁邊鳴着不平。</p>
<p>那般過分儒雅的人一看見了兩篇對罵的文字，就會咳聲嘆氣地說「這是個人主義呀」，「這會使文壇黑暗了呀」，即刻像被弄得心神不寗起來。那意思是：旣是文壇，總得要「文」纔行。</p>
<p>不過事實却和那般儒雅派底想頭完全相反。文壇固然要「文」，然而假使沒有對罵，却也就沒有了文壇。因爲就單是「捧」，也得找陪襯「捧」的材料，也就是不能不有批評；但一有批評，就難免有「回敬」的文字，到頭是終於不能避掉「對罵」的。而且對罵也只是一時的現象，日久必然有一方不能再罵，一方會得到勝利。人大概總看見勝利者成了勢力以後的太平無事，而忘記了倘先是太平，却就不會有勝利。現在「白話」是成了普遍的工具了，但牠的成功，就是靠從前「新靑年」派和舊派的封罵；當時站在「新靑年」派一面的戰鬭者實在並不是爲了個人，而那結果，現在我們是完全明白的，也實在並沒有使文壇——雖然當時還談不上文壇——黑暗。</p>
<p>還有那般過分熱心的人一看見有新的潮流起來的時候，總是先在新的作品上出氣，於是、拿出實在的東西來呀」，「這樣的作品可呌人失望透了呀」，眞是痛哭流涕，氣咽聲嘶，好像因爲作品不好，新的潮流也便沒有意義了。</p>
<p>其實歷史上每當一種新的潮流剛一出現，作品都不能立刻便是成熟的。原因很是簡單：第一，旣是新的潮流，跟着那潮流來的作品，內容自然很少有舊的遺產的憑籍，這首先非經過一點時間沒有辦法可以成熟。第二，新的潮流難免要牽動到工具上的變化，而新式的工具決不是一早晨或一晚上可以運用得好的，依然非經過一點時間沒有辦法可以成熟。人大槪總看見有了名的作品是怎樣的高明，而忘記了牠却也有過不高明的祖宗。例子還是「白話」運動時代的情形：常時熱心家也曾經發過一陣急，說沒有一篇像樣的作品。——自然，那在當時的確也是事實。然而等到「白話」運動成功了，那些不像樣的作品很快地便不見了影子，代替那位置的便是像樣的作品。一直到現在，雖然我們常常自恨「沒有偉大的作品產生」，但不能算壊的作品却總有一些了。誰也不敢再說新文學作家拿不出實在的東西，誰也不敢再沒頭沒腦地喊他底失望。</p>
<p>歸根結蒂，過分儒雅的人和過分熱心的人都是給文壇上舊勢力撑腰的脚色。他們底皺眉和他們底大呌，只是對新勢力所採取的「繳械法」而已。</p>
<p>但若果要問：到了非常的動亂時期，這類過分儒雅的人和過分熱心的人是不是還耍露面呢？答曰：要露面的。低他們却會變成給整個民挨底敵人撑腰的脚色。方法還是皺眉和大呌，然而却是繳保衛民族的作家底械。目前就有這樣的例子。厭惡別人指摘不睬　治的傾向和復古傾向的，便是前一種人；死咬着抗戰文學是「抗戰八股」的，便是後一種人。</p>

<p>（上略）憶在蘭州時曾托港友轉上一函，想早收到。弟於二月二十日由蘭飛至哈密，三月八日由哈密乘汽車經鄯善，吐魯蕃，到了迪化；現在已逾一月又半矣。乃因諸事叢雜，不克早奉片言，至以爲歉。此决萬里遠行，經過昆明，成都，西安，蘭州，在昆明住了十多天，蘭州住了四十五天。生平未嘗至西北，此决乃飽覽塞外風物，允以乘汽車自哈密至迪化一段，橫度大漠，見百數駱駝之大隊商，委蛇去來，可謂壯觀。允有可記者，則自港動身後，凡現代水陸空交通工具，幾無不用之；自港至海防，乘船；海防至昆明，走滇越路，盤山而過，計穿過山洞百五十餘個；自昆明至哈密，坐飛機；哈密至此，汽車。而在蘭時，又曾坐羊皮筏子渡黃河，履冰而過黃河（皆在蘭垣外，）蓋可謂皆一試矣。沿途皆有所記，惜尙無時間整理之也。此間新氣象，可記者甚多，亦因事冗，未能命筆；暑假時或可爲之。尙擬利用假期，遊歷外區，北疆如伊犁塔城，或者不乏機會先往也。（下略）四月三十日</p>

<p>喜樂有眞，有僞，有大，有小，亦可以說，有深有淺。例如兩人相見嘻嘻哈哈，口中充滿喜樂，面上的筋肉，却帶着悽慘，苦毒的形容；這種喜樂，是虛僞，淺薄，人人皆知。那麽，社會上所流行的下等娛樂，其所謂喜樂，比嘻嘻哈哈，又能眞過幾何，深過若干呢？所以這一等喜樂，可以概括世界上物質享受的一般人，所得的喜樂，在他們或有高下的區別，總而言之，都是偽而淺，小的喜樂，不值一談，我們言其眞而大者。</p>
<p>孔子：蔬水曲肱而樂，送股子：算瓢陋巷而樂，可爲樂之眞；范文正：後天下之樂而樂，以天下的樂爲樂，可爲樂之大。但此又頗難言，宋時程子教人尋孔顔樂處。可見孔顔的樂，頗不易得，日不易　。程子雖如此教人，至今等著的並無幾人。至於范文正的樂，乃是大政治家的抱負，普通的人均不足以語此。像這樣的喜樂，雖說眞而大，却未免空談無補。我們談切實的喜樂。</p>
<p>切實的喜樂，不是感情的喜樂，不是知識的喜樂，更不是不幸恰恰的喜樂，乃是性軍中的喜樂。不是努力尋求的喜樂，不是偶然遇合的喜樂，乃是眞神賜予的喜樂。那麼，這種喜樂，究竟怎麼得着呢？日聽下問。上海基督教文字佈道會郵箱一二二七號</p>

<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>海是無比的遼闊的，伸展到極遠，極遠，與穹蒼交織成一片蔚藍的錦綉，點綴於宇宙之間，從洪荒到如今。一位文學巨匠描繪海的言語——海笑着，曾引起多少人的美麗的遐想呢。熱情的年輕人夢着碧色的柔波。</p>
<p>在一個濱海的城市裏，我住過兩個夏天。那是渤海灣的一個港岸，關東的咽喉。草原上人民的汗珠支持了牠的繁榮。每條街道，每座建築都絞合着奴隸們的血，腥味刺鼻。但，牠却扼死了被榨取者的生命。蜿蜒而進的鐵路是條噬人的毒蛇，沿途吐出毒舌，一舐一舐的舒捲着。</p>
<p>這時，我的日子過得頗爲荒唐，就消磨在做做夢，看看海。不過寂寞的日子裏，倒有些動人的遐想，整日地期待着一片白帆，航海的人帶來了什麽故事。我很羨慕水手的生活，對於人生這角色也是一個有力的暗示。</p>
<p>不管是白天抑是夜晚，總歸飄流於大海。一個頑强的靈魂，一個硬朗的身子，永遠與自己的生命開若玩笑。（說大不大，說小也不小的玩笑。）避開了焦石與冰山，戰勝了驚濤和駭浪，終於安全地歸來。不久，又飄流去了。戰鬭，不息地戰鬭；緊張，永遠地緊張。</p>
<p>一天，我離別海洋，來遊大陸了。汚濁的江水，更汚濁的小河，每每使我憶起藍藍的海。海呵，你無恙嗎？</p>
<p>海盜侵入了。海開始咆哮，像條憤怒的巨獸。那一天，那海濱城市也來一個咆哮呢？駛過海，淸風白雲該會帶個信息來吧？但，我已經聽到過太多英勇的漁人的故事了。（牠們使我激動，更給我以鼓勵。）</p>
<p>海不再是寗靜的了。你聽，它的憤慨的傾述。海底埋葬着多少的哀怨呢？然而，那兒也將是海盜的墳墓呵！</p>

<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>收成好·老閘橋畔滿眼瓜船　捐稅重·市場價格不減往年</p>
<p>夏天是一個瓜果的季節，在大熱天，允其是西瓜，在地貨市塲上最是活躍。雖然冷飲是風行到都市的每一個角落裏，但蜜甜的西瓜究竟要比人造的冷飲品爽口得多，所以每年的盛夏，西瓜市在上海，也還保持着相當的熱閙。</p>
<p>本來呢，在上海，，由於傳統關係，有四處西瓜市塲，便是十六浦，白渡橋，老閘橋，和新閘橋。現在情形是比較不同了。白渡橋因爲特殊情形，西瓜市相當慘淡，可算沒有。新閘橋和閘北隔河相望，「八一三」後，橋面經過相當長久的封鎖，所以橋南的地貨行，在不良的環境之下，就都關起門來，自去年起，也就沒有西瓜市了，過往的地貨行，現在已變成堆棧了。因此，比較熱鬧的西瓜市塲，也祗有法租界外灘的十六浦和老閘橋。爲了西瓜已跟着小暑上市，一個夏天的早上，我特地趕到老閘橋去看西瓜市的眞相，結果帶回了下面種種消息：</p>
<p>老閘橋，大家知道是個菜市，除非雨天，是常年的熱鬧着，而在這大熱天，西瓜市的熱閙，沒有去看過的人，更是不會知道的。自福建路，北京路的角子上起，一直至老閘橋和蘇州路的角子上，所有的布房，十九是開着地貨行，每一家的門口橫着一塊市招，店堂裏面堆滿了西瓜，東瓜，還有倒掛着大串的香蕉。所以這幾天的地貨行，巳成了瓜果的世界，而特別是西瓜，堆得山樣高，是佔了買賣的重要部分。</p>
<p>不僅是地貨行裏，就是水門汀的石階上，也滿處放一籮一籮的大筐西瓜。每一個攤子上，坐着一個赤膊或穿着香雲紗衫褲的大漢，在揮着蒲扇，旁邊插一枝大秤。速得走道的中間，也盡是堆着東瓜，西瓜，人又那麼多，速路都不好走，汽車不必說，是擋駕了。</p>
<p>就在這大淸早，西瓜販子也在老閘橋集中了，看中了大籮筐裏的西瓜，就和瓜攤旁邊的大漢談起價來，也許種瓜的農人也有在旁邊，經過中間人的一喝，討價還價，雙方走得弄來，便成交了。西瓜販子買到了西瓜，便來不及的把西瓜扛回去，或是喊小車推回去，不是自已設攤出售，就是到每一條小弄堂裏去呌賣。因此，這幾天每一個早上，老閘橋一帶，盡是些種西瓜和販西瓜的人。還有比較精甜的人家，也自已到老閘橋去買西瓜，目光好，眼睛兇，自然比經過一决西瓜販子的手要便宜，上算。</p>
<p>在人叢之中，還有幾部不識相的卡車在軋閙猛，我好容易走到老閘橋畔，橋南蘇州路一段的角子上，也都是地貨行。蘇州河裏，停滿了小火輪和木壳船，這裏面特別使你注意的便是西瓜船，裝滿了烏皮或紅皮的西瓜。有幾隻船上的人正在把西瓜一個個的丟到岸上，而岸上有人用手接住，不會脫手，練就一功，也自有其本領。</p>
<p>這些西瓜船是種西瓜的農民打鄉下撑來的，上海的西瓜大半是平湖，練塘，金潭，和蘇常一帶運來的。去年爲了雨水多，西瓜的收成太壊了，加着某方的駐軍，看見了要隨手取來大嚼，各地的僞組織要抽重稅，所以種西瓜的人千九虧本，而上海市上西瓜幾乎絕跡，要買十多元一擔。今年雨水少，西瓜不但甜，收成又好，因此，運到上海的也比較多，照理可和戰前一樣，每擔祗售兩三元，但爲了沿途損稅的繁重，還是要五六塊錢一擔呢。</p>
<p>種西瓜的人天然要賺錢，沿途的僞組織要抽去每擔一二元的捐稅，到了上海，地貨行老板的當秤，喝價，要抽取什一的佣錢，經過西瓜販子的手，當然又要賺錢。好吧！上海人吃一擔西瓜，剝削的人也够多了。你如果在當地，直接向農民買，怕不到兩元一擔，到上海却就要五六元。本來在這樣米珠薪桂的情形之下，「瓜島」上多數住民，連飯都耍吃不起了，那裏有多餘的錢去買西瓜解渴？祗是另一面，自有一般有錢的人家，除了汽水，鮮橘水之外，還要買幾擔西瓜。所以西瓜市塲雖减去了兩個，老閘橋的西瓜市塲，還保持着戰前的熱閙。</p>
<h3 id="c121">新事業　家事服務 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>— 德惠</p>
<p>最近，金融界有「家事服務」的新事業進行。他們辦這「家事服務」的宗旨，是覺得一個家庭，不論人口的多少，和事務的簡繁，其日常生活費用的收支，因男子在社會上服務時多，對家事不遑兼顧，大多是由主婦派人或親自料理的。但是這種派人或親自的料理，旣費光陰，又耗車資，而且携款往來，一不當心，有遭掱手刦賊等的各種意外呢。因爲是這個綠故，所以，創設了這「家事服務」。目的爲謀家庭的便利，减輕主婦的額外消耗，增進自己的利益。</p>
<p>這「家事服務」的委托手續是這樣：在事前，須把國幣五十元以上存入開戶，或者是把每月預計應付的數額，事前存入。當由收存行號，發給收款證，支款單，並須由存戶留存印鑑。這樣，待你要管款時，可將應付的單據，開具發給你的支款單，寄至行號，他們會立卽代你分別繳付。取回的收據和回單，等到月底淸單開出時，一併送上。倘若委托收款，也須將行號發給的收款證，送交他們，收到後，記入尊戶賬冊；同時，並卽通知。</p>
<p>這種「家事服務」的收付款項，也有利息可算，利率是六厘，於六月二十日和十二月二十日，各結算一决。更有除委托收付款項以外，有消費合作的組織。凡加入「家事服務」的，對日常需用的米，煤，柴炭等日用品，可以委托代辦。在要需用時候，就可以囑送，但事前須存入相當的款項。此外，還有人事諮詢，代爲解答人事上的一切。</p>
<p>「家事服務」在今日之下，的確很迎合家庭的需要，但因爲還是新興，所以也有待於他日的發展呢。</p>

<p>第十四回　烟火千家鄉合作　波濤萬里瀛海飛行</p>
<p>這種合作商店，瑣碎是瑣碎極了，然而有一定管理之法。倘然管理得宜，也沒有什麽煩難。朱愛立起初出之以游戲，以三百塊錢試辦起來，不想近來蒸蒸日上，他覺得有了興趣了。因爲自由村的村民，一天天的多起來。村民多起來，他們的日用需要品自然也要多了。這樣也向合作商店去拿，那樣也向合作商店去拿，又便宜，父省事，何樂而不爲呢？因爲合作父有合作的組合，近來中國台作事業大發達，允其關於消費合作，有許多工廠，都與合作商店，直接貿易，訂有合同，不再經中間商人之手了。其他，便是合作社與合作社，互相交換。也有的是從一個合作總社，便分出許多合作分社，使它們分散到民間社會去。也有的是一個批發合作社，將各種物品，掛發到各個零賣合作店去。總之關於合作一件事，飛形色色，各有不同。而歸根結蒂一句話，就是賣者買者，得互助之益，不敎中間的商人，盤剝利益以去。自從合作事業盛行以後，一班向來作投櫗商的人，更無從再投機了。好在人民的消費中，有幾件已經由國家來統制了。第一是糧食，第二是燃料。譬如一個地方，每年要吃多少米，都有一個統計。糧食是以人口爲比例的，這地方倘然是有十萬入，當然老早預備好十萬人的糧食。本地可以出產多少糧食，本地出產的糧食，够不够本地的需用，要是本地出產的糧食，不敷本地需要的，便要從別地方運來。本地出產的糧食，倘有多餘的，也可以轉運到別地方去。就像自由村，它那裹稻田很多。本村所出的米，從前十成之六，供給本村之用，四成便可以輸出去。現在自由村人口多了，似乎本村所出的米，以六成供給本村，要不够了。然而反只要五成就够了，其餘的五成，便可以輸出去。這是什麽終故？原來自由村人口雖然多了，却是農業上有了進步。從前一畝田可以出若干石米的，此刻可以加倍。從前每年一熟的，此刻母年可以兩熟。這樣的算起來，豈不是五成就够了。而且這五成中，連每年儲備倉中積儲的米，也算在裏頭了。（一六○）</p>

<p>在數量較多的紗，布，織造，繅絲，機器等工廠之外，在滬西有着二家火柴廠，火柴雖是人們不能或缺的必需品，但是火柴工友對火柴竟會像仇敵樣不願提到，不願看見，但是爲了活命，却終不能脫離火柴工塲的範圍。</p>
<p>廠方爲了增加生產，使工人們每天作着十四小時的工作，在鴿籠樣的悶熱的房屋中，被蚊蟲臭蟲整夜侵襲着的每一個夜晚尙未完全度過，就又得將沒有恢復體力的身子投進劇烈的工作中，會不應響工作效能麼？但是廠方是更聰明，他以論件計算來付給工資，工資的低微與事實上不能另招夜班工人的火柴業工人，就在這情况下苟延殘喘。</p>
<p>火柴裝盒女工，在裝好一百二十小盒火柴時，才能拿到一分幾厘的工資，如果他手術還沒有熟練，工帳單上一角左右一天是很多看到的。在火柴廠工作着有十年的老工友，至多也祗能做到五角一天，食住之外，這些工資還會有多餘麼？</p>
<p>工作重，工資低之外，火柴廠是比其他工廠危險的塲合，因爲火柴原料非但易燃，而且極易爆炸；工人生命，是處於極度危險中，工人們誰都希望廠方能提高工資，縮短工作時間，更重要的是投保團體人壽險。</p>
<p>「在國難時間，工人們是更較以前沉着地忍受着一切苦痛，祇要資方不過份壓迫，我們決不受人利用而掀起無謂的鬥爭的，同時，希望資方能洞悉我們的誠意而改善我們的待遇。」以上是　　火柴廠工友最後向我說的話。</p>

<p>— 華志</p>
<p>要求賠償名譽損失</p>
<p>德國元首希特勒之酷愛電影女明星，在歐美巳成顚撲不破的傳奇。巴黎著名電影雜誌「銀咖啡」近刊一特寫，題爲「第三德國的妖婦」，其中羅列希特勒的情婦凡三人，一即猶太籍女明星麗芬絲妲兒（Rietenstahl）一即史琳孚斯公主（Schillingfurst），另一即新目拉伐列亞來巴黎的波蘭國女明星，著名「黑眼睛」芭拉尼葛栗（Pola　Ngers）。稱她們的潛勢力足以控制希特勒。</p>
<p>就中前二人對此，並無反響。但第三人妮葛栗聞訊之餘，大爲暴跳，認爲全非事實，伊不是希特勒戀人。特委托律師向巴黎第十二區懲戒法庭控訴，耍求該雜誌賠償名譽損失」百萬法郞。她的理由是：「我並不憎恨世界上任何人，然而在我至好的朋友中實無希特勒其人。」</p>
<p>這幕相當桃色的戲劇，就招引了許多訪員們接踵而來。妮葛栗逢人便說：「你想，我會有勢力控制希特勒！這些無稽　言，徒然使我化去訴訟費。我雖沒有仇恨之人，但我有我的立塲。該雜誌損壊我的名譽。定要賠償的！」</p>
<p>這塲官司不知如何圓塲。但就這案主角言，她本是波蘭著名的愛國明星，曾爲波政府拍了不少民族抗戰之片，値茲德波風雲緊急之秋，妮葛栗自不會上希特勒圈套。她來巴黎預備主演一鉅片，再回本國效力。她並無到好萊塢去的計劉。因好萊塢電影界已有決議：「凡與獨裁者有關連之人，無論眞僞，概饗以閉門羹。」麗芬絲妲兒去秋已有前車之鑒，便可證明了。</p>

<p>— 施病鳩</p>
<p>碩果僅存之老伶工余玉琴，爲光宣年間著名之菊部人才，今年已七十一歲，居常不善攝生，而體格旺健逾恒，近年來以處境日非，狀稍額唐，而古稀老翁，尙欲課徒以自給，其苦况向爲同行所習知，月前偶櫻小恙，初不介意，後乃轉劇，卒於本月八日下午五時，在平寓病歿，消息傳來，聞者莫不同聲痛惜也。</p>
<p>皮黃武旦人才，向稱寥落，能自成一派，而稱一代典型，爲後人所崇拜者，僅余玉琴及朱文英二人而已，朱氏以出手驚險見長，宗其派者，如九陣風朱桂芳，輓近如閻世善朱盛富宋德珠等，皆一貫作風，余氏以矯捷活潑稱著，溶合花旦刀馬旦於一爐，故演出時有刀馬花旦意味，能傳其衣缽者一，可稱絕無僅有，降格以求，差强人意者，亦僅榮蝶仙一人而巳余玉琴皖之潛山人，小名莊兒，武旦及刀馬旦並擅，兼工花旦，玉立亭亭，這肖燕趙佳人，最初出演滬上老丹桂茶園，唱開鑼戲，無藉藉名，繼走蘇杭，又輾轉長江各地。光緒十二年始入都，隸四喜班，以演「兒女英雄傳」「醉酒」「迷人館」「靑石山」「虹霓關」「十粒金丹」「演火棍」「大賣藝」「蕩寇志」「全本德政方」「泗洲城」「鐵弓緣」「百草山」「珍珠衫」等劇，最受都中顧曲家歡迎，劇藝而外，復善經營戲館，及創辦科班諸事。光緒十五年，創福壽班，十九年又創小福壽科班，二十三年於崇文門外茶食胡同，建設廣興園，故一時余莊兒之名，無人不知，後爲內廷供奉，備受光緒帝寵愛，張肖傖兄所著之「鞠部叢談」其評余玉琴之技藝篇中，有軼事一則：</p>
<p>淸德宗示最賞識玉琴，玉琴演「能仁寺」，甫下塲，猶未卸妝，德宗遽召之入殿，携玉琴手顧后曰：「莊兒眞可兒。」后以其近御座，將訴諸太后，德宗懼，視余伶所佩刀非假物，將律以御前持械罪，揮之出，曰送刑部。余伶遂報暴故，故歌樓絕跡者幾二十年，至宣統時，始敢稍稍與人交接。</p>
<p>宣統三年，玉琴於東安市塲創設丹桂園，民元以兵變燬於火，後雖集資重建，但兀氣未復，負債日鉅，從此即一蹶不振。民十以後，家業蕩然，景况益非，賴同業接濟及課徒以度日，一代藝人潦倒如此，蓋亦大可憐矣。玉琴之藝，可傳者的有三點：（一）體態輕盈，柔若無骨，而神態軒昂，不失女將身份，其作風以武旦作經，花旦爲緯，剛柔並具，古今一人。（二）武藝純熟穩練，不弄驚，不和衆，跌撲功夫，朱文英不能及。（三）臉部有戲，眼神特佳，傳神阿睹，轉瞬萬變，此得力於花旦造詣，後學者極難體會。</p>
<p>玉琴父名大海，爲邑中這生，有賢名，不容於繼母，逃上海，家貧遂使莊兒學戲。玉琴性溫善，母早歿，侍父至孝，父偶有疾，恒侍奉湯藥，不輟晝夜，嗜酒而飲不過量，父以其有擴歌喉，　戒之，而偷飲如故，故人謂玉琴以孝名，而僅些不能循父言，蓋亦性所至歡也。有子二，長名小琴，隸小福壽科班，學武生，决名幼琴，習文武老生，皆無成，且先氏而早夭云。</p>

<p>— 冷芳筆錄</p>
<p>……「女硯秋」侯玉蘭小姐口述……</p>
<p>我在戲校裏肄業五年，覺得學戲非具極大耐苦精神不可，這實在不是一件易事。同時，對於演戲工作很感興趣，認爲它的感化力是很大很大的。現在，我所學過的靑衣戲與花衫戲雖不算少，戲校裏也早算是畢業了，但在藝術方面和自己的理想還差得很遠，故於今番回平去後，決意仍回母校繼續求學，一時不想搭班，自已和家庭方面，都就是這個主張；一則母校裏環境很好；二來自己年紀還小，便在文課方面，也還要用功幾年。最低限度，在時間上的分配，是想「學」多於「唱」，暫時不願意把自己的薄技過分職業化。</p>
<p>其决，關於我的舞台作派，承蒙許多先生和報上多多捧塲，鼓勵；說我學程先生（硯秋）學得很像；我眞感激，我也很慚愧！本來，我是吳富琴先生的學生，吳先生跟程先生演戲近二十年，他對於程先生的藝術很有硏究，因此在基本技術的學習上，便多採取程先生的技術，照規矩用功。程先生自已，他也曾經給我說過幾齣戲的，像「花舫緣」的身段，「武家坡」的跑坡，圓塲，進窰；「金鎖記」的水袖；以及「斟情記」在排練時，恰値程先生來了，他將身段，音調整齣說了一遍；「孔雀東南飛一在灌唱片時，程先生亦將唱的字聲音節全給我糾正了一回。此外，在平常時期，程先生的秋聲社每决唱戲，我們都去留心觀摩；學老生的注意王少樓先生，學花臉的注意侯喜瑞先生，學小丑的注意曹二庚先生，我們學靑衣的，更注意程先生的唱白與動作，在此種種方面，確曾獲得不少益處，但也決不敢說就有較多的心得；程先生是位大藝術家，他的藝術實在太高深，我眞慚愧得很，我怎能够常得起說是很像程先生呢</p>
<p>我還是一個女孩子，一切懂得很少；希望愛護戲劇的先生們不吝多多賜敎。</p>

<p>旦角所用之長包頭創始於梅巧玲氏　　然而據他戲畢後與人談起這事，他實在並不覺得怎樣苦楚，這正合了「爲善最樂」的這句話啦。可見一個人只要精神上覺得榆快，則一切皮肉上的痛苦，也就自然而然的消滅於無何有之鄕了。梅老先生已到退休隱居的歲數，本來可以謝絕外界一切的煩擾，從此不再以色相示人啦。但是他仍自動的發起慈善救濟等會戲，不但發起而且還又發明這種長包頭來减少自已的老態。他道樣的慈厚待人，無怪他的後人能享這般大的盛名呢。梅博士的名馳中外且不說他，就是雨田的胡琴也是中劇塲面上首屈一指的人物，現在旦行裏包頭的時候，仍多延用那條長的數尺的紗包頭，雖像毛世來這般年紀輕輕十幾歲的孩子們，滿臉都是嫩皮肉，但是他們也全用着這個，倘要問他們這是甚麽用意，他們雖是照樣能回答出倘理由，然而對於該物的出典，恐怕是知道的人很少數呢。國人多有個數典忘祖的毛病，允其梨園中人祗重師承，不求甚解，後台中之事事物物，母皆知其當然，而不悉其所以然，所以不佞特以一得之見，貢獻於同好之前，一冀梅氏當日發明該物之用心不致泯滅，二則希望其文孫畹華博士仍當秉承其令祖仁慈之風，多爲全國靴胞造福，集合生·旦·淨·丑·各行名再發起一大規模之振濟義務戲，以彼之地位登高一呼，庶幾不難促其成，幸博士加之意焉。—（六二）—</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Suburbs Have Already Made Contact with Japanese Troops; Chinese Troops Advance Towards Shantou in Three Routes; Japanese Military Decides to Intensify Blockade of Fujian Coast; Most of the Remaining Japanese Troops Southeast of Chao'an Are Cleared; Chinese Troops in Eastern Shanxi Achieve Another Victory, Xiangyuan Recaptured; Chinese Troops Recover Nanxinji, Suixian Under Siege <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to a Shaoguan dispatch, the Lingnan Chinese troops have been ordered to launch a general counter-offensive. A certain Commander-in-Chief personally went to the front line to supervise the battle. Most of the remaining Japanese troops southeast of Chao'an have been cleared. The Japanese troops intending to invade Jieyang have also returned to Shantou. Currently, Chinese troops are advancing towards Shantou in three routes. The central route is advancing rapidly along the Chao-Shan Road and has already made contact with Japanese troops in the suburbs of Shantou. The Japanese forces on the western front are very exhausted and are still entrenched in their strongholds. The Chinese troops are adopting mobile counter-offensives, annihilating the Japanese garrison troops one by one, which has been very effective. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Japanese military has decided to intensify the blockade of the Fujian coast. It is reported that Vice Admiral Oikawa, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Fleet in China, has sent an ultimatum to the foreign consulates in Shanghai and the Chinese Customs, demanding that warships, merchant ships, and citizens of third countries withdraw from the ports of Sanduao and Luoyuan by 8:00 AM on Friday. After this deadline, they will be prevented from entering or leaving by force. The Japanese Navy will not be responsible for any damages incurred by the shipping industry. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources today, the Chinese troops counter-attacking Chao'an recaptured Chao'an yesterday. At the same time, the Japanese strongholds between Shantou and Chao'an, including Anbu, Fuyang, Yixi, and Fenxi (transliteration), located along the railway line, were recaptured. In addition, nearby villages also fell into Chinese hands. The Japanese troops there are currently retreating southeast along the Han River. Intense street fighting is still taking place in Chao'an city, with Chinese troops wielding broadswords to engage in close combat. Another report states that the fighting around Jinshan (transliteration) and Lushan is also extremely fierce, with over 1,000 Japanese soldiers killed. This is one of the biggest defeats since the Japanese invasion of northern Hubei. (Associated Press dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) After a certain Chinese army recaptured Wu乡 on the 11th, more than 1,000 remaining Japanese troops fled south. Taking advantage of the empty defenses of Xiangyuan, they occupied 歘城. When the Japanese troops had not yet established a firm foothold, a certain Chinese army launched a sudden attack, engaging in bloody battles for several hours. The Japanese troops were unable to withstand the assault and fled towards Xiatian on the morning of the 12th. Xiangyuan was immediately recaptured. While appeasing the people, the Chinese troops pursued the fleeing Japanese remnants. The Japanese troops who fled west joined forces with the Japanese troops in Xiatian, numbering 3,000. On the 13th, they advanced and captured Changzhi. Traces of Japanese troops were also discovered in the Yin City (south of Changzhi) area on the 13th. The defending Chinese troops fiercely resisted and have moved to a 口口 area, ambushing the Japanese troops. (Dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a Chinese military spokesman, the Chinese troops in the Taihang Mountains are currently using the same strategy as when defending Zhongtiao Mountain to counter the Japanese troops' multi-pronged offensive. The Japanese troops attacking from Anze are currently surrounded by Chinese troops in the Tunliu area. That route of Japanese troops has become a trapped target. Although the route of Japanese troops attacking Changzi from Taigu successively occupied Wuxiang, Liaoxian, and Yushe, which were abandoned by the Chinese, this was a strategy to lure them deep and cut off their retreat. Therefore, once the Chinese launched a four-sided encirclement, the Japanese troops had no choice but to abandon Yushe and Liaoxian, which they had already occupied. The route of Japanese troops advancing from Xinxiang has been blocked by Chinese troops in the Huixian area. The route of Japanese troops advancing southwest from Hongdong has been intercepted by Chinese troops in the Jixian area. According to the spokesman, based on captured Japanese documents, since mid-March, the Japanese have augmented their troops in China by six divisions and four brigades. Another two brigades were assigned to the "Manchukuo" area, and another two divisions are preparing to launch an offensive in Shanxi. However, these troops are either underage or elderly and poorly trained. Currently, the Japanese forces operating in Shanxi consist of twelve divisions and four brigades. As for the puppet troops, they mostly operate in the Suiyuan and Hebei border areas under Japanese control. The spokesman also stated that a Japanese heavy artillery regiment, formerly stationed in northern Hubei, has recently arrived in Hankou and is reportedly being transported elsewhere, likely to the Mongolian-Manchurian border. (Associated Press dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing On the morning of the 15th, at 4:00 AM, Chinese troops launched an attack on the Japanese troops in Xinhui and Jiangmen. The Japanese troops retreated to their fortifications and dared not resist. That morning, the Japanese troops in Beijie continuously shelled the Licun and Liuzhuang areas, attempting to prevent the Chinese troops from advancing. The Chinese troops returned fire, and a fierce artillery battle ensued. (Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing In the past ten days, the Chinese troops and civilians in Zhongshan have been active along the coast, launching a heroic defense war and inflicting heavy blows on the stubborn Japanese troops. They have killed over a hundred Japanese soldiers and destroyed several Japanese warships. The Japanese attempted to retaliate but retreated separately. On the evening of the 15th, they mobilized over a hundred shallow-water warships, steamers, and armed fishing boats to the sea off Daxieshan, and successively evacuated. The coastal areas of Zhongshan are now peaceful. (Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The recent floods in North China caused by heavy rains have greatly affected the Japanese military transportation to and from Shanxi Province. All the railway sections of the Pinghan Railway have been disrupted and traffic has been suspended. It is feared that it will be difficult to restore operations within two weeks. The railway between Baoding and Shijiazhuang has been flooded several times. The tracks in the Liangxiang area have also been severely damaged. The railway bridge over the Zhuma River has also been washed away. One-third of the county is under water. It is reported that Xinzheng, near Gaobeidian, is now six feet deep in water, with no fewer than 7,000 houses submerged, leaving 60,000 people homeless, due to the breach of the Yongding River dike near Liangxiang. It is reported that the Japanese troops are attempting to conduct small-scale troop movements, traveling by train in sections, and using boats to transport supplies in areas with heavy flooding. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Liuhuang After the Chinese troops recaptured Chao'an at around 5:00 AM on the 17th, a large number of senior Japanese officers were still surrounded by Chinese troops in the Yingzhou Hotel, the Japanese High Command. They are currently being cleared. (Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Guilin At 6:00 AM on the 18th, six Japanese warships and eight aircraft were spotted off the coast of Shanwei, appearing to be attempting a landing at Shanwei. (Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan After the Chinese troops recaptured Chao'an city on the morning of the 17th, the Japanese troops retreated to the Jinshan and Lushan areas south of the city. By noon, the Chinese troops had surrounded those Japanese troops again. Japanese aircraft frequently came to assist in the battle. The Chinese and Japanese troops are currently engaged in mutual combat. (Dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Over 3,000 Japanese troops, who had advanced in separate routes from Dongwanghe Town, Qin County, were ambushed by a certain Chinese army. After three days and nights of bloody fighting, the Japanese troops were defeated on the 9th. The Japanese suffered more than half of their forces killed or wounded. The remnants fled towards Qinyuan via Yugou (southwest of Guodao). The Chinese troops pursued them and advanced to an area north of Qinyuan by the morning of the 14th, where they were engaged in combat with the Japanese troops. (Dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Around 4,000 to 5,000 Japanese troops from Zhangma and Zhongcun (southeast of Yicheng) launched a full-scale eastern offensive on the 14th. A certain Chinese army immediately intercepted them, killing many Japanese soldiers in the Baihualing and Nancun (southeast of Zhongcun) areas. Most of the Japanese troops are still blocked in the Nanyangcun (west of Zhongcun) area. In addition, a unit of over 1,000 Japanese troops circumvented and captured Dongfeng Town (west of Yangcheng) on the afternoon of the 14th. A certain Chinese army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese troops in the Shangxialian Mountains. (Dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reports received here, fierce bloody battles have been taking place in the Changzhi, Changzi, and Gaoping areas of southeastern Shanxi for several days. The Japanese troops, with 5,000 to 6,000 men, launched a major offensive in nine routes. Most of them encountered strong resistance from the Chinese troops and suffered heavy losses. The Chinese troops near Changzi have decided to defend it to the death. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>Fancheng Suixian is under siege by the Chinese troops and may be recaptured. Nanxinji, south of Zhongxiang, was recaptured on the 17th after a Chinese assault. Over 300 Japanese troops fled northeast. The Chinese troops are currently pursuing them. Zhongxiang and Yangzi were also surrounded by the Chinese troops crossing the river on the 17th. The Japanese were greatly alarmed. The Chinese attacking forces in the Qianjiang area have also made smooth progress, approaching the Japanese stronghold. (Dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>Xiangyang At around 10:30 AM on June 17th, a large Japanese naval bomber flew over the Chinese army positions near Huangmei. It was spotted by the Chinese troops, who immediately concentrated their anti-aircraft machine gun fire on it. The Japanese aircraft was immediately hit, caught fire, and crashed near a village fifteen kilometers northwest of Huangmei. The Chinese troops rushed to search the area, but both the crew and the aircraft were destroyed. Only some important documents were discovered. According to a recent announcement by the Japanese, it was learned that the occupants of the aircraft were Major General Kita, a senior staff officer from Hankou, and eleven other important officers, who were flying from Hankou to Hunan to attend a certain important meeting.

<p>(Chongqing) Chen Cheng, Director of the Military Affairs Department, declared today that two years of war have not had any impact on China's human resources. When the war first broke out in July 1937, the total number of Chinese land forces slightly exceeded one million. Since then, the number of frontline soldiers has increased to two and a half million. China not only does not feel any difficulty in replenishing casualties but has indeed established a greater military force under enemy fire. In addition to the 100 reserve divisions that have already been enlisted, there are currently at least 15 million able-bodied men of military age, who have received some training and can be immediately called up for service. After a short period of intensive training, they can be sent to the front lines. From 1935 to 1939, more than eight million able-bodied men received military training, and more than six million joined local militias. There are also plans to train 4.5 million people in other unoccupied areas of China this year. In a war of attrition, whoever can persevere will be victorious. China relies on its great human resources for this. Every Chinese person, from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to the common people, deeply believes that China will achieve victory.

<h3 id="e10">On Black Market Exchange Rates <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Since the morning of June 7th, the Shanghai black market exchange rate has undergone dramatic changes in an attempt to find a new level. The British exchange rate, starting at 8 1/4, and the US exchange rate, starting at 16.32 3/4, after two days of hovering, the British exchange rate settled at 6 9/16 and the US exchange rate settled at 12.32 25/32. Now, forty days have passed, and yesterday the bank refused to use North China banknotes. Yesterday, the black market exchange rate once again experienced an astonishing contraction, with the British exchange rate contracting to 5.25 and the US exchange rate closing at 10.25. Compared with the market price of the past forty days, the British exchange rate contracted by 1.3125 and the US exchange rate contracted by 2.53125. Is this also the so-called new level of the black market exchange rate?</p>
<p>The repeated tightening of foreign exchange rates naturally has its own factual causes and effects inherent in it, and it should not be evaluated by any kind of theory. However, the factual impact created by this is also not negligible. First, let us talk about the motivation for this tightening, which is due to the flood of North China banknotes. North China banknotes are subject to two kinds of external forces, political and economic pressure. Therefore, there is a difference of 25% in currency value between Tianjin and Shanghai, and a difference of two in the British exchange rate, which has become an excellent opportunity for profit-seekers. If it is not dealt with, the damage will be unimaginable. What are the results of limiting the use of North China banknotes and tightening exchange rates? The market prices in Tianjin and Shanghai seem to have achieved a closer effect, but the currency value has another great divide due to the restriction of circulation. Foreign exchange still flows out through the free buying and selling of the black market. It can be seen that the restriction of cash withdrawals, the restriction of the use of North China banknotes, and the repeated tightening of exchange rates in the past forty days are only minor issues and cannot be regarded as great strategies related to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Why? In fact, it is not enough to plug the leak of foreign exchange. This is the first thing to pay attention to.</p>
<p>In this evolution of the financial market, what the financial community has adapted to is the promotion of remittance, the restriction of cash withdrawals, the issuance of new remittance certificates, and the rediscounting of reserve funds. Circulation is certainly not without skills. As for the wealthy, it has neither eliminated their attempt to escape funds nor blocked the path for them to escape funds. The foreign currency and gold bought and stored by these people, on the contrary, smile knowingly because the foreign exchange rate is repeatedly tightened. They gain wealth without labor and wealth is doubled. Only legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises and the general livelihood of the people, even if they want to force a smile, cannot get it. Some say, what is the harm to industry and commerce? When the water rises, the boat rises. If the cost is heavy, the selling price can be expensive. If you do not look at the sudden contraction of foreign exchange yesterday, gold, cotton yarn, raw soybean oil, hardware, woolen cloth, foreign sugar, coal, and white coal are all advancing directly. Thus, looking at it, the industrial and commercial circles not only have no losses, but even have unexpected profits. However, this is knowing one thing and not knowing the other. It is seeing only immediate gains and not seeing long-term considerations. It is necessary to know that the impact is: first, the cost is heavy, and the frozen funds are also heavy; second, the prices are high, which will inevitably weaken the general purchasing power; third, the goods are stagnant; and fourth, production is reduced. All these obvious principles have their inevitable bad consequences. Is it said that there is no damage to the industrial and commercial industries and that it is a blessing for them? This is the second thing to pay attention to.</p>
<p>Why not examine the phenomena of all industries? Today, as a result of the natural development of the machinery industry, the required materials cannot be completely self-supplied. For example, the spinning industry needs to use American cotton and Indian cotton. Another example is the newsprint and type-casting alloy ink used by newspapers, which are all awaiting import. Other cultural enterprises, such as the paper, instruments, stationery, plate-making, chemical medicines, and physical instruments they need, have no proper supply in the country, and there are many cases of obtaining materials from foreign countries. Now the central government's official exchange rate still maintains a British exchange rate of one shilling and two and a half cents and an American dollar exchange rate of thirty yuan, but the foreign exchange needed by yarn factories, newspapers, schools, etc., can only be sought in the black market. The fact that they cannot obtain it at the legal price is one, and the fact that they have to flow out through the black market costs almost three times its value is truly an unavoidable fact, and the third thing to pay attention to.</p>
<p>As for the general livelihood of the people, the unemployed also need to live, and the orphans and widows who rely on meager property also need to live. Leaving this aside for the time being, let us take the salary and wage class as an example. Their income has a fixed amount. Even if prices rise sharply, and the firms and shops to which they belong can increase wages by 11% or 12% in time, it is still not enough to fill the needs of life, which is rising surprisingly fast. This is truly an extraordinary phenomenon in extraordinary times, and it must be endured by the people. Moreover, the people themselves should plan to cope with the individual problems related to personal life, and should not add to the worries of the nation. However, we should also pay attention to the direct and indirect impact that is actually produced for the entire society. This is the fourth thing to pay attention to.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discussion on restricting the use of North China banknotes, on the one hand, helped to promote the view of "joint banknotes." Now, after restricting the use of North China banknotes, followed by a further contraction of the exchange rate, the black market price of "joint banknotes" suddenly soared to one hundred and one yuan to exchange for one hundred legal currencies. When the market price was the lowest, it only reached 60% or 70% of the legal currency. There are more than one reason for this, and the way to deal with it is to maintain the credit of the legal currency as the basis. If it is not like this and only deal with it with piecemeal measures, not only will the effect be minimal and temporary, but also losses and misfortunes will follow. Examining the various phenomena in the past two months, there are always things that I cannot bear to say but cannot avoid. This is the fifth thing that the financial authorities should pay attention to the subtleties of the people's hearts and pay more attention to the facts.</p>
<p>All of the above are presented with the fear of concealing the disease. Therefore, I make harsh words. As for the detailed plan for prescribing the right medicine, I look forward to experts, and the more active measures, I secretly believe that they are still the crackdown on the Shanghai black market exchange rate that this newspaper has repeatedly discussed. The black market has its cause, and the crackdown is somewhat difficult. Therefore, I believe that what is most worth studying is the question between national finance and social economy, between fact and people's hearts, and between the highest degree of self-reliance of all industries and the lowest degree of survival conditions. The three have their own entities, each has its own emphasis, but their birth, extinction, rise, and fall are mutually cause and effect, and cannot be neglected, neglected, and must be considered together. Today's problem is in the black market. Cracking down on the black market is certainly not an easy task, but under the principle and belief of considering everything comprehensively, there must be something to be done in the black market.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Clay Receives New Instructions: Anglo-Japanese Negotiations to Resume Today; Britain Insists Talks Remain Limited to Tianjin Incidents; Britain and the United States Maintain Close Contact on Far Eastern Issues <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a semi-official announcement released here this afternoon, British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, received instructions from the British government at 8:30 this morning regarding the report on the Anglo-Japanese ambassador's talks held on Saturday. Therefore, the second round of talks between Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita is expected to take place tomorrow. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After receiving instructions from his home government, British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, visited Japanese Foreign Minister Arita this afternoon, requesting a second round of talks on the Tianjin issue tomorrow. Following their discussions, they decided to reconvene at the Foreign Minister's official residence at 9 a.m. on Wednesday. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo, the British government, upon receiving the report from its Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, drafted instructions and telegraphed them to the ambassador last night for compliance. According to responsible sources here, the instructions are extremely detailed, and once they arrive in Tokyo, the ambassador can proceed with talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita accordingly. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) According to news from here today, the British side has informed the United States of the developments in the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. In other words, the British side has detailed the key points of the talks between the British Ambassador and Arita last Saturday to the United States, seeking their opinion. According to a British government spokesperson, Britain is determined to limit the Tokyo conference to negotiations on specific incidents in Tianjin, while acknowledging that the Japanese side intends to discuss broader issues. Arita's criticisms of Britain's China policy are seen as overly critical. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo, the government telegraphed new instructions to British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, last night to continue meetings with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Formal negotiations will commence once the scope of the talks is determined. Regarding this, political figures here have recently stated that Anglo-Japanese negotiations should be limited to various local incidents in Tianjin. Foreign Minister Arita had indicated his acceptance of this several weeks ago, but it is surprising that Japanese newspapers have recently been demanding discussions on various political issues in the Far East related to Britain. The local issues are twofold: (1) the extradition of the four suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng, and (2) the administrative issues of the British concession in Tianjin, specifically administrative issues related to Japanese interests. The British and Japanese sides may agree on a certain "neutral status" for the British concession, but only on the condition that Britain maintains sovereignty. As for the issue of 50 million yuan in silver deposited by Chinese banks in the British concession, it is a matter related to monetary policy, not a local incident, and it involves not only Britain but all countries with interests in China. Britain is not in a position to discuss it with Japan alone. In short, the outcome of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations depends entirely on Japan's ability to accept Britain's position. While this position can be slightly adjusted in detail, it is best to first determine the scope of the negotiations before formal negotiations begin. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>China's Resistance Relies Entirely on Self-Reliance</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Regarding the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo being limited to the dispute over the blockade of Tianjin, newspaper vendors here are generally pessimistic. Newspapers state that the Japanese side deeply believes that Britain would rather compromise to gain temporary security than engage in decisive competition, so as not to affect Britain's position in the Far East. Newspapers trace the history of the past century, believing that if these negotiations break down, Britain's animosity will be even greater than the anti-Chinese sentiment during the Boxer Rebellion. At the same time, Britain's assistance to China should be greater than the Anglo-Japanese Alliance's assistance to Japan. Newspapers make it clear that even if a temporary agreement is reached between Britain and Japan, it will not have any impact on China's position, as China's resistance does not rely on any third country, but on "the sacrifice of the flesh and blood of the Chinese people." (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>British Newspapers Advocate Mother Country Give Little Ground</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers have recently unanimously advocated that Anglo-Japanese negotiations must be limited to the Tianjin incident. "The Times" stated that Britain must ensure that China enjoys the benefits of extremely friendly neutrality. British expatriates in North China believe that if London can take more resolute and reasonable actions, it will greatly benefit the overall situation. Although the Japanese side can claim to have occupied North China, in reality, Lieutenant Colonel Spear traveled through vast areas effectively controlled by the Chinese side under Chinese protection, even in areas thousands of miles from where the Japanese army first launched its war, which is under Chinese control. Isn't this thought-provoking? "The Daily Telegraph" stated that Japan's purpose is to pressure Britain to stop providing economic and other assistance to China, so there is no room for compromise between Britain and Japan. Japan's war against China violates the Nine-Power Treaty, which Japan seems to have forgotten. "The Daily Mail" stated that even if the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty abandon their rights, can Japan's so-called historical changes truly maintain long-term security? Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is currently leading his elite troops, waiting for an opportunity to move in mainland China, and guerrillas are constantly attacking the Japanese army at any time and place. Isn't the answer to the question extremely obvious? "The Daily Express" stated that Japan has declared its determination to destroy the British Empire. If so, Britain is ready for everything. "The Yorkshire Post" stated that the British government and people would rather risk war than constantly make concessions. (17th)</p>
<p>(London) "The Birmingham Post" published an article today, commenting on the Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo, stating that based on Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration, it is evident that the informal demands of the Japanese side are completely unacceptable. British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie's report seems to give considerable importance to these informal demands. "The Manchester Guardian" also criticized the Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo. Regardless of how tactful the wording of the spokespersons of both sides may be, the fundamental differences of opinion between Britain and Japan remain. If Japan is prepared to resolve the issue, the Tianjin incident can be concluded tomorrow. Although there is still some hope for the success of this conference, according to well-informed sources, neither side has decided on any measures to remedy the situation in the event of a breakdown in negotiations. They believe that the real crux of the matter lies not between Britain and Japan, but between the Japanese government and the young officers. Members of the House of Commons do not show concern, fearing that the British side, in the conference, is paying too much attention to the Tianjin incident and neglecting many other unfair treatments that Britain should pay attention to. Some observers strongly state that Japan's position in China is becoming increasingly difficult, but please Britain quickly work to determine a practical view on how to end the war, and take advantage of this Tokyo conference to explore the possibility of this matter.

<p>(London) British Prime Minister Chamberlain's announcement in the House of Commons yesterday that Japan hopes Britain will better understand Japan's various difficulties in the Far East has evidently raised concerns among Chinese circles here last night. British Foreign Secretary Halifax intends to meet with Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, today to discuss the Far Eastern issue in detail. Guo Taiqi will inquire about the progress of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo. Within the realm of possibility, he may discuss with the British Foreign Secretary the prospects for a £3 million export credit loan from Britain. According to yesterday's news, the credit loan negotiations are progressing rapidly. Government sources said yesterday that China may request Britain to continue maintaining Chinese legal tender.

<p>Incident of British Factories in Shanghai Being Isolated</p>
<p>During the session of the House of Commons today, Labour MP Mr. Day inquired about the details of the protests lodged by the British authorities regarding the Japanese side surrounding three British-owned factories on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek in Shanghai with barbed wire barriers. Under-Secretary Butler replied that, according to information received by Foreign Secretary Halifax, only two British-owned factories were affected, namely the Chongxin Cotton Mill and the China Steel Car Manufacturing Company, and another Chinese-owned cotton mill under Japanese management. Previously, access to the factories was through a pier on the banks of the Suzhou Creek, but this pier has now been separated by the Japanese side with barbed wire, making it impossible to use it again. The British Consul-General in Shanghai has made written and oral protests to the Japanese Consul-General, urging the Japanese side to allow the reconstruction of the original wooden bridge, which does not obstruct the passage of vessels on the Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>Dingle Case Remains Unanswered</p>
<p>Butler also replied to a question from Labour MP Mr. Noel-Baker, stating that the Japanese government has not yet responded to Britain's protests regarding the injury and death of Mr. Dingle, and the issue of further action is currently under consideration.</p>

<p>Under-Secretary and Conservative MP Mr. Strauss asked whether the Foreign Office had recently made representations to a certain bank with its head office in London, regarding reports that its Shanghai branch had cooperated with the Japanese authorities to weaken China's exchange reserves.

<h3 id="e16">US Neutrality Act Revision Issue: Roosevelt Determined to Continue Struggle; Summons Congressional Leaders for Persuasion; Pittman Bill Has Gained Support from Powerful Figures <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull met with congressional leaders at the White House today to discuss the Neutrality Act. According to responsible sources, no resolution was reached at the meeting. However, new Senate leader Mr. Barkley told reporters that he believed that Congress would not deliberately adjourn at a time when it should fulfill its greatest responsibility. Barkley's remarks indicate that President Roosevelt intends to further urge the Senate to consider the neutrality policy. According to the New York Times, President Roosevelt plans to address the nation in a fireside chat within the week to discuss the issue of lifting the arms export embargo. At the same time, the opinion of several observers here is that the current implementation of the Neutrality Act favors democratic countries more than it favors the Axis powers. The argument is that when war breaks out and the arms embargo is implemented, Britain and France can still purchase any other goods, while the Axis powers cannot because they have no cash to buy them. It is estimated that 75 percent of the goods purchased by Britain and France are materials other than munitions and aircraft. Therefore, the current Neutrality Act only reduces the benefits of democratic countries by 25 percent, and they are still stronger than what the Axis powers enjoy. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman's "embargo against Japan" resolution, although previously delayed, has today created a possibility of promoting the reconsideration of the Neutrality Act. Democratic Senator Gillette's vote last week caused the dispute over the Neutrality Act to be delayed in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He told people today that he strongly supports prohibiting the export of war booty to Japan. Since Gillette and Pittman agree on this matter, it has raised hopes that Gillette's views on the Neutrality Act may also change. It is reported that congressional leaders, when meeting with President Roosevelt this morning, stated that although some members are willing to adjourn, the leaders have decided that, at the very least, "school will not be dismissed until the lesson on the Neutrality Act has been learned." It should be noted that Gillette was one of the two Democratic members opposed by President Roosevelt in the last election because they criticized his domestic policies. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to official sources last night, US President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull generally expressed opposition to the principle of prohibiting the sale of American goods abroad, but they may give careful consideration to Pittman's bill on embargoed goods. It is reported that President Roosevelt's attitude has not yet been determined, but Hull has made it clear in his letters to the chairmen of the Foreign Relations Committees of both houses of Congress that he opposes the principle of embargoes. Furthermore, a certain high-ranking official in the government believes that the President will not oppose the Pittman bill, as the target of the bill is mainly Japan. Recently, Japan has disregarded American interests in China, and the US government has protested against this. If the resolution of the US Congress can conform to Pittman's proposal, the President will certainly gain unprecedented power in diplomacy. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding what procedures the government will use to urge Congress to complete the revision of the Neutrality Act during this session, the government's attitude remains hesitant and undecided. According to outside sources, this is because the government is not confident about the support or opposition of public opinion. Generally, most members of Congress are in favor of Congress adjourning as soon as possible, preferring to convene a special session in times of international tension. Various political observers who have come here from the Midwest and West have stated that isolationists occupy a dominant position in those areas, and public opinion largely fails to understand why the current Neutrality Act needs to be amended. Secretary of State Hull's message to Congress a few days ago was intended to enlighten public opinion, but it may not be effective immediately. That is, those congressmen from those regions who previously strongly argued that the current Neutrality Act could prevent the United States from being drawn into the vortex of war are now inconvenient to say that there is another way that is better. In short, the differences in opinion between Congress and the White House are a great divide, and it is feared that it will be difficult to bridge the gap. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Following the death of House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman McReynolds, Democratic Congressman Bloom was duly elected to succeed him today. For several months, when McReynolds was on sick leave, the duties of Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee had actually been performed by Bloom. Today's election was merely a formality. In addition, Democratic Congressman Mr. Celler was also elected as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. Bloom told reporters that he believes that it is urgently necessary to organize a congressional federation among the republics of the Americas, so that members of Congress from the United States and the 21 Latin American republics can establish personal relationships and thereby enhance the solidarity of the American continent. However, before formally advocating this proposal, he would like to solicit opinions from all parties first. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Cabinet held a regular meeting this morning to discuss the Manchurian-Mongolian border war and the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo. After Army Minister Itagaki reported on the border war, Colonial Minister Koiso asked Foreign Minister Arita about the diplomatic situation regarding the Manchurian-Mongolian border incident. Arita replied that everything remains as before. The border incident is directly related to Manchuria and Mongolia and does not directly involve Japan. However, the government is paying considerable attention to this important issue. Koiso also inquired about the attitude of third countries towards the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo. Arita replied that there has been no significant change in the attitude of the United States and others towards the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tokyo. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Hiranuma, Foreign Minister Arita, Finance Minister Ishiwatari, Army Minister Itagaki, and Navy Minister Yonai held an important meeting here this morning to discuss the new situation arising from the Soviet Air Force's Sunday air raid on Fularji (an important railway junction) and Halana Mountain (150 kilometers inside Manchuria from the border). It is reported that Army Minister Itagaki met with Prime Minister Hiranuma at 9:45 this morning before the regular Cabinet meeting, advocating convening a five-minister conference.

<p>(Moscow) Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Lozovsky received a note verbale from Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo Shigenori on the 16th, in which he disputed the illegal activities of Japanese traders who enjoyed oil and coal mining concessions on Sakhalin Island, and expressed dissatisfaction with the Soviet court's judgment on those traders. Finally, the Japanese Ambassador, in a note verbale, in the form of an ultimatum, demanded that answers be given to the various issues raised by July 18. Lozovsky, under the instructions of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, returned the aforementioned note verbale to the Japanese Ambassador yesterday and stated on the spot that the document contained threatening language and was in the form of an ultimatum. Therefore, the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs considered it unacceptable and returned it without consideration. (TASS, 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e26">The Danzig Problem Enters Another Delicate Stage: British Newspapers Say Germany and Poland Prepare for Negotiations; National Socialist Party Claims Attitude Remains Unchanged <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>Danzig: After Danzig National Socialist Party leader Forster and propaganda chief Zeske visited Hitler in Berchtesgaden, they returned to the Free City today. According to the two, they sensed an optimistic attitude from the Führer, who expressed his view that, without external interference, negotiations between Poland and Germany could resolve the Danzig issue. At the same time, judging from appearances, military preparations in Danzig continue, indicating that this contentious issue remains pressing. However, the steady flow of arms into Danzig has at least temporarily ceased, but the reason is unclear. A newly built National Socialist Party broadcasting station on a hill outside Danzig has now begun broadcasting, and ordinary radios can no longer receive broadcasts from foreign stations. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>Danzig: Regarding the talks between German Führer Hitler and Danzig Free City National Socialist Party leader Forster yesterday, the local National Socialist Party newspaper "Danziger Vorposten" has issued an official statement saying that the city had taken various precautionary measures in the past "to cope with any hasty actions that Poland might take, and the German authorities fully approved of them. The city is striving to be incorporated into Germany, and the guarantees given to us by Führer Hitler, even though various governments, including the British government, have attempted to intimidate us, remain unwavering. This is something that the city's leaders can believe in without a doubt." Regarding this, the so-called concessions made by us, as reported by British and French newspapers, are not accurate. The possibility of a compromise solution between Germany and Poland, as rumored by foreign sources, is also "purely fabricated." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(London): Regarding the Danzig Free City issue, The Times recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent, expressing optimism. It stated in brief: "The information about the talks between German Führer Hitler and Danzig City National Socialist Party leader Forster has had a good influence in the city after being relayed by telephone. Forster returned to the city yesterday, and it is generally believed that he brought with him a peaceful solution proposed by Führer Hitler. The city's newspapers, which had previously been relentless in attacking Poland, have changed their tune since last week. In addition, it is heard that members of the National Socialist Party's defense stormtroopers have been granted leave, which is the first time in several weeks. Although this news has not been fully confirmed, it is credible. In short, responsible German figures here and readers seeking news in the press all believe that the Danzig City issue is very important to Germany, but the German government will not compare its strength in spirit and politics with Western European countries because of this." (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Danzig: The semi-official "Danziger Vorposten" published an editorial today discussing the Danzig issue, stating in brief: "Although officials in Berlin are silent about British Prime Minister Chamberlain's recent speech on the Danzig City issue, British and French newspapers believe that Germany seems willing to negotiate. For example, recent editorials in London's 'The Times' and Paris' 'Le Figaro' stated that the tone of Danzig City newspapers has seemed to soften in the past week. This is absolutely not true. Danzig City National Socialist Party leader Forster's recent visit to German Führer Hitler is enough to prove that the beliefs of the people of Danzig City have not wavered. Germany is now determined not to make any more rejected proposals to the Polish government. As long as the anti-German movement exists in Poland, there is no possibility of negotiation." (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>(London): Newspapers in Berlin report that Germany and England may ask Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to mediate the Danzig Free City problem. Political figures here do not believe this. The current system in Danzig can be modified, and the power to decide this rests with Poland. If Germany is willing to negotiate directly with Poland, the door is still open. In addition, it is heard that Poland is willing to discuss the matter of increasing trade with Germany again. After the start of business talks, it would not be difficult to discuss the Danzig problem further. Regarding this, German newspapers have suggested that German-Polish business talks could begin on August 10th. The British side is very interested upon hearing this, believing that Germany may not want to cause a crisis because of the Danzig problem. This can be seen in Poland's firm attitude of not wanting to make any concessions. The Vatican has also considered mediating, but the Polish government has refused. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Danzig: The Danzig City authorities formally stated their position today, saying that for many years, the Danzig National Socialist Party's policy has been completely consistent with Germany's, so Danzig's fate is in the hands of Führer Hitler. Regarding the reports in London newspapers that Danzig will negotiate independently to resolve the Danzig and Corridor issues, it is considered completely groundless here. According to Danzig City's Director of Information, when he met with foreign reporters, he said that Danzig's general aspirations are in line with the National Socialist policy, which is exactly the opposite of Poland's hope that Danzig will not merge with Germany. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin): Berlin newspapers have been very silent recently on the Danzig issue and the Moscow negotiations, so it is difficult to speculate on Germany's attitude. It seems that Berlin is deliberately keeping the above two issues secret, making them unfathomable. (Haitong, 8th)</p>

<p>(Moscow): The negotiations between England, France, and the Soviet Union to conclude an anti-aggression agreement, after an eight-day hiatus, continued last night at the Kremlin, lasting one hour and forty-five minutes before adjourning. However, it is heard that there have been no fundamental changes in the negotiations. It is reported that they discussed the recent responses from England and France to the Soviet proposals, which the Soviet government is now considering. At the same time, the English and French representatives have relayed the Soviet Union's attitude to London and Paris, and they will meet again soon to discuss it. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris): Regarding the continued negotiations between England, France, and the Soviet Union, the "Le Petit Parisien" claims that there are still two major difficulties in the Moscow negotiations: (1) If the Baltic countries promote relations with Germany, the guarantee insisted upon by the Soviet Union will cause disputes; (2) The Soviet Union advocates immediately starting three-nation staff talks, but England and France both believe that an official agreement must be signed before military secrets can be revealed. (Haitong, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris): Although officials refuse to comment on the negotiations currently being conducted by the authorities of England, France, and the Soviet Union, well-informed sources say that the representatives of England and France have reiterated the positions adopted by their respective governments, and Molotov immediately agreed to ask his government for instructions.

<p>Warsaw: British Overseas Commander-in-Chief General Ironside and the Polish military attaché to the British Embassy arrived here by special plane this afternoon for a four-day stay. He will meet with General Smigly-Rydz, Inspector General of the Army, tomorrow to discuss Anglo-Polish military cooperation in detail. He will also meet with Minister of War Kasprzycki, Foreign Minister Colonel Beck, and Chief of Staff General Stachiewicz, respectively. He also intends to observe Polish army exercises before inspecting key military points in western Poland and returning home on Friday. Diplomatic circles here recently declared that General Ironside's visit is of great significance, as General Ironside will be the commander-in-chief of the British expeditionary force in the event of a war in continental Europe. Therefore, the talks between the Anglo-Polish army general staffs will make a great contribution to strengthening military cooperation between the two countries. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(London): General Ironside's trip to Warsaw has been praised by newspapers here. The Conservative Party's Daily Mail stated, "The active efforts of civilized countries in defense are evident in General Ironside's trip to Warsaw. The country should be very pleased that this man, who is known for his talent and ability, has been given this important task." The Labor Party's Daily Herald stated, "Britain has sent a military delegation to Warsaw to exchange views with the Polish military authorities to prepare for staff talks between the two sides. After Ironside arrives in Warsaw, formal talks should begin to agree on various military measures so that when Germany takes aggressive actions in the future, it can contain the German forces on both the east and west fronts at the same time. At that time, if Germany avoids advancing on the eastern front, then the Polish army should take the offensive. A detailed plan, which must be prepared in advance, will be discussed. It is also appropriate to discuss the unified command of the British, French, and Polish armies when war breaks out in the future." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: General Ironside's visit has been commented on by various newspapers, all saying that Anglo-Polish military consultations have been completed as a result of this trip. The government-affiliated "Kurjer Poranny" stated, "Military cooperation is of primary importance for the implementation of the Anglo-Polish political agreement. General Ironside's visit is not only a courtesy but has a very practical goal, which the press does not need to over inquire about. What we can know is that General Ironside has achieved important results. England, France, and Poland are actively preparing militarily and will be able to resist aggression and prevail. This will have a decisive impact on the development of the European political situation." The conservative "Czas" stated, "Poland's cooperation with England and France is neither subordinate nor unequal. The three governments fully know that their mutual interests are the same, and they coincide with the interests of other countries in Europe that wish to maintain independence and freedom. Therefore, it was decided to cooperate politically and economically, and to cooperate militarily when necessary." Other newspapers said that General Ironside commanded the Allied forces in Siberia during the European War, when there were Polish soldiers under his command. Therefore, he was familiar with the bravery of Polish soldiers and sent a letter to Polish Commander Haller praising him. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>(Paris): After 150 British Air Force bombers recently came to France for practice flights, the Ministry of Aviation announced that French aircraft would also fly to England in a short period of time for the same practice. However, the number of aircraft and the date of departure have not yet been decided. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris): The fact that more than 100 French bombers are about to fly to England for long-distance test flights has attracted much attention from various newspapers, all saying that the cooperation between the air forces of the two allied countries, England and France, is becoming increasingly close, and large-scale exercises will be held soon. This time, the air forces of the two countries can practice flying in each other's airspace, which is only part of the cooperation. "Paris-Soir" stated that these bombers are the latest models and will simulate air raids on London, Liverpool, and even Wales, and the British air defense team will conduct defense exercises. In addition, the British Air Force is preparing to send 300 bombers and 1,000 air force officers and men to France again within days for large-scale exercises, and plans to fly all the way to the Mediterranean coast and then fly back to their original bases. This exercise has the form of a wartime attack, and the aircraft will only receive orders a few hours before departure. Although the French Aviation Ministry is also aware of the situation, the French air defense teams will not receive any prior warnings. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris): "Paris-Soir" recently published an article with the headline "The Air Forces of England, France, and Poland Become One," commenting on General Ironside's visit to Poland, stating in brief that General Ironside's trip would discuss with General Smigly-Rydz, Inspector General of the Polish Army: (1) The position of the Polish Army after the outbreak of war in the future and the issue of cooperation between the air forces of England, France, and Poland; (2) The issue of the United Kingdom supplying Poland with aircraft and sending pilots to train the Polish Air Force to use these aircraft.

The Japanese ship was carrying Chilean potassium nitrate, which would explode if it caught fire, so it is expected that the ship will sink. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(San Francisco): This morning, a Japanese ship named "Mokuyo Maru," sailing to South America, caught fire and quickly sank in the Pacific Ocean, 850 miles east of Tokyo. The ship, weighing 8,618 tons, belonged to the Japanese Mail Steamship Company. This time, it was returning from South America with 219 passengers and 102 sailors. After the accident, it sent a radio distress signal at 6:09 AM. Four Japanese ships set off to rescue them, but the American Oil Company's oil tanker arrived first. After the American oil tanker tried its best to rescue them, all but two of the Japanese ship's passengers and sailors were rescued. The reason for the ship's fire and sinking was that it was loaded with many flammable materials such as Chilean nitrate and cotton. It is heard that the Japanese ship was also loaded with a large amount of copper ore. The ship left Chile on May 27th and left Los Angeles, USA, on July 2nd. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e34">Associated Press Manager Returns from Inspecting Mongolian Border War Zone; Japanese Claims of Aerial Victory Cannot Be Verified; Heavy Casualties on Both Sides in Soviet-Japanese War <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>The Continental News Agency reports that Associated Press Far East Manager Morrison returned here yesterday (17th) from the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian war zone. According to him, the Japanese claimed a great aerial victory, destroying more than 500 Soviet-Mongolian aircraft. Foreign reporters on a trip to the front near Lake Baikal did not see concrete evidence to verify this claim. The Japanese army showed reporters two machine guns, the tips of military aircraft wings with clearly visible Red Army star emblems, and other parts of destroyed aircraft. However, these items may have all been collected from the wreckage of two aircraft. The Japanese armed forces of "Manchukuo" far outnumbered the Soviet forces in the area. According to his estimates, there must have been between 25,000 and 30,000 Japanese soldiers between the front line and Hailar, including Japanese soldiers in the front-line trenches and in the Hailar barracks. As for the Soviet forces, Morrison stated that the Japanese claimed that the enemy's strength did not exceed 5,000 men. When he was at the front, he saw clear evidence of Japanese air superiority. Although he did not see anything that could verify the Japanese claims of aerial victory, there were various Japanese military installations scattered throughout the area within twenty minutes of flight from Outer Mongolia, and he did not see any organized attacks by Soviet aircraft, artillery, or infantry. The Soviet forces that crossed the Khalkhin Gol River into "Manchukuo" had apparently been driven back. It took the Japanese army nine days to drive the Soviet forces back across the river.</p>
<p>According to what he saw, he believed that the Japanese army was successful in this effort. Morrison did not know how many troops were engaged in combat, but the Japanese claimed that the Soviet-Mongolian forces numbered 4,000 to 5,000, and he did not know how many of the 25,000 to 30,000 Japanese soldiers near the battlefield participated in the battle. Morrison continued that the undulating wilderness was the battlefield for the war of attrition, and the bullet marks proved that there had been a fierce battle. Casualties on both sides must have been heavy, and although he could not obtain the numbers, they must have reached several thousand. On July 13, when he was in Hailar, he saw a train of ten cars, packed with wounded Japanese soldiers on both the upper and lower levels.</p>
<p>Full of Wounded Soldiers</p>
<p>And this was not the only train that drove out of Hailar. When he passed through Hailar, there were still hundreds of urns containing the ashes of fallen Japanese soldiers. Although it was said that Hailar had been bombed before he arrived, there was no sign that the city had suffered any pain. He saw many bomb craters caused by Soviet aircraft bombing closer to the front line, but they did not seem to have caused any damage. Morrison also said that he saw only 14 Soviet prisoners of war during this trip. The Japanese did not claim to have captured more than three to four hundred people, but they were very sure about the number of hundreds of Soviet aircraft shot down. The Japanese army did not display any of its captured</p>
<p>Soviet Military Equipment</p>
<p>This indicates that any Japanese victory could not defeat the Soviet forces. The only items that represented the capture of the Red Army's equipment were four tanks. The Japanese army hired White Russian drivers to drive military trucks, but he never saw White Russians in uniform or actually belonging to the army. When Morrison was in the area, the Japanese army did not release Soviet casualty figures, but said that of the 4,000 to 5,000 Soviet troops participating in the battle, 200 were left behind after being driven back across the Khalkhin Gol River.</p>

<p>Nanjing Correspondence: Nanjing suffered heavy losses due to a hurricane and rainstorm on the 12th. The most serious damage was caused by collapsed houses and injuries. Because houses were destroyed after the war, ordinary merchants were forced to build simple and crude houses to make a living. The wood was not strong and could not withstand the invasion of the wind and rain. The places where houses collapsed and people were injured on that day are briefly recorded as follows: Yongfeng Cloth Shop on Zhonghua Road was blown down by the wind, and 10 people inside the house, including Lu Bingheng, were injured. Yu Cheng Tea Shop collapsed and injured Li Jinyun. Yuchang Glass Shop on Jiankang Road collapsed, injuring 10 people including Li Zhirong, and killing 4 people including Sun Zhang. Zhou Xikang's daughter-in-law, Wang, was killed in Zhonghua Gate. Li Yihuan's wife, Li Lan, and her son, Xiao Mao, were killed in Shiba Street. In addition, more than 30 people were killed and injured by collapsing houses in Jianye Road, Beisan Lane, and Yunnan Road. At the Rihua Guild Hall in Xiaguan, a prostitute, Feng Li, was killed, and six people were injured: Feng Yinbao, Xiao Yinlou, Xiao Fengying, Xiao Yulan, Zhang Guifang, and Xu Guiying. The president, Japanese Yoshinobu Hidekichi, was also slightly injured. More than a dozen men and women were killed on Damalu, Baoshan Street, and Shangbu Street. Countless electric poles and trees were blown down. Eight men, women, and children were killed on Baixia Road. A ferry boat at Cotton Embankment opened at the mouth of the two rivers and was overturned by the wind. Twenty-three male and female passengers fell into the river. Eighteen people were rescued at the time, and five people, including Liu Mengbai from Hefei, died. Most of them made a living selling chickens and ducks.</p>

<p>He is also proficient in the national language, knows Han etiquette, and speaks elegantly. After a few words of greeting, Lang Jie first said that the tribal people are an integral part of the nation and are willing to dedicate everything to the country to seek national liberation. He deeply hopes that the government will allow them to go to the front lines. Furthermore, the Azhar area in the tribal region, 180 li west of the Zhangnao River, is rich in gold, but it has not yet been developed. He also hopes that the government will quickly go and exploit it to enrich the strength of the war of resistance. He was treated with great favor when he arrived in Rong to pay respects to Director Deng. He plans to go to Chongqing in the coming days to pay respects to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and volunteer on behalf of the 10,000 tribal people in Sichuan. The 300,000 tribal people have prepared 300,000 war horses and, after receiving orders, will depart from [illegible]. When speaking, he clenched his fists, and his tone was extremely heroic.</p>

<h3 id="e39">Unified Enrollment for National Colleges and Universities; Shanghai Is Ready; Examination Dates: August 7th to 10th; 23 National Colleges and Universities Are Enrolling <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>This year (the 28th year of the Republic), first-year freshmen (excluding specialized students) of all national universities and independent colleges will be handled in accordance with the unified enrollment method promulgated by the Ministry of Education. After admission, the Ministry of Education will distribute them to various colleges and universities. Transfer students may still be recruited by each college and university itself after approval. Unified enrollment will be held simultaneously in fifteen regions: Chongqing, Chengdu, Nanzheng, Kunming, Guiyang, Chenxi, Yanping, Guilin, Lanzhou, Enshi, Taihe, Yongkang, Qujiang, Zhenping, and Shanghai. The examination questions for each region will be determined and issued by a number of question-setting committee members appointed by the Ministry of Education in accordance with the prescribed standards. Each region should hire a number of question-setting committee members to prepare a set of test questions for each subject in accordance with the standards set by the ministry for question setting and grading. If, due to transportation difficulties, the unified test questions cannot be delivered on time, or if the test cannot be completed due to a temporary air raid or other accidents, the pre-prepared test questions for that region may be used. The evaluation of test papers shall be the responsibility of the national universities and colleges in the region in principle. The admissions committee of each region shall hire a number of examiners to grade the papers by subject and send the results to the ministry. The ministry will decide on the students and the number of students to be admitted from each region. The Ministry will designate grading areas for the six regions of Zhenping, Enshi, Taihe, Yongkang, Qujiang, and Lanzhou. If the performance of examinees in the four regions of Yanping, Lanzhou, Taihe, and Yongkang cannot be used by the Ministry to decide on the students to be admitted and the number of students to be admitted due to factual difficulties, the admission standards stipulated in each test area may be followed to decide. The standard for distributing admitted students is their stated preferences and scores. They will be distributed to schools in the examination area and nearby schools first. If all the schools in the area are full or there are no registered students for the desired departments, the Ministry will assign schools. Students with relatively poor scores may be admitted to university preparatory classes. Graduates who pass this year's graduation exam may be recommended by the education administrative departments of each province and city, with the top 10% of outstanding students being exempted from the exam and distributed to the colleges and universities in their respective provinces and cities or nearby, according to the aforementioned regulations. Provinces that have not held graduation exams or schools that have not participated in the graduation exams shall not be recommended by analogy. Students with equivalent academic qualifications who register for the new student recruitment this year must submit a detailed resume. The number of students admitted shall not exceed 10% of the total number of students admitted in each region and shall be limited to the top half of the total ranking of students admitted in each region. The registration and examination dates are set as follows: (1) Registration dates: July 25 to 30; (2) Examination dates: August 7 to 10. The admission fees for each admission area will be covered by the registration fees (not to exceed two yuan).</p>
<p>Shanghai is ready with preparations. The registration and examination dates are in accordance with the Ministry of Education's regulations. The location will be announced soon. The names of the enrolling schools and departments of national colleges and universities nationwide are listed below.</p>

<h3 id="e42">Youth Women's Table Tennis Tournament; Championship Decided This Afternoon; Final Battle at the YWCA at 4 PM; Zhu Min Most Highly Regarded Among the Four Female Players <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>The first "YWCA Cup" Women's Individual Table Tennis Championship, organized by the YWCA, has a total of seventeen participants. All the female players have consistently attended the matches and have shown excellent spirit. Zhu Min, Kuang Shaomei, Huang Tongyin, and Gan Lanjun are among the best performers. The championship match will be held at the main hall of the YWCA at 999 Jing'an Temple Road, starting at 4 pm today. If the top five players have equal scores, they will need to compete again on the spot to determine the rankings. After the match, veteran player Chen Linsheng and Yu Lingxiao, the newly crowned university cup individual champion, will perform an exhibition match to add to the excitement. There will be a wonderful performance at that time. After the match, Mrs. Huang Xien, chairman of the board, will present the awards. Guests must enter with a viewing ticket. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Huang Tongyin vs. Gan Lanjun (Final)</p>
<p>Huang Tongyin vs. Kuang Shaomei (Final)</p>
<p>Zhu Min vs. Gan Lanjun (Final)</p>
<p>Chen Linsheng vs. Yu Lingxiao (Exhibition)</p>
<p>According to the assessment of Chen Linsheng, the team's instructor and referee, his comments on the four outstanding female players are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhu Min: Skilled in looping shots. Since joining the YWCA training class, she has been diligent in practice and has made rapid progress. She currently leads the pack with a record of fourteen wins and one loss. She is the most promising to win this year's championship and is the best harvest among the new talents of the YWCA Cup.</p>
<p>Huang Tongyin: Good at looping, very steady, calm in the face of the enemy, and patient in battle. She is known as "taffy." She was the most highly regarded in this year's championship, but unfortunately suffered two defeats, so there is no hope for the championship. If she wins both matches today, she can get the second place. Huang is serious about hitting the ball, but her posture is not very beautiful and needs to be corrected urgently.</p>
<p>Kuang Shaomei: She started practicing early, but her progress is slow, probably due to her plump body. But she is willing to work hard, so her results exceed expectations. Her serve is very clever, and her short block is her specialty. Her forehand loop is very fierce.</p>
<p>Gan Lanjun: From Tianjin, a rising star. She can loop and defend, and her attitude is generous. Her playing posture is beautiful. It is a pity that she lacks experience. If she can win all two matches today, she still has a chance to win the third place.</p>

<p>Foreign Exchange Reaches Unprecedented Lows</p>
<p>English Gold Once Reaches Five Pence</p>
<p>American at a Tight Nine Yuan Six Two Five</p>
<p>At Noon, HSBC Still Had External Supply</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market experienced another bout of extreme contraction. When HSBC first posted its rates at 9:30 AM, the English exchange rate suddenly plummeted by one pence, and the American exchange rate also sharply contracted by 1.9375 yuan. By 10:00 AM, the English exchange rate had fallen another half-penny, and the American exchange rate had decreased by another 0.9375 yuan. Both had broken the previous low recorded on August 8th of 6.25 pence and 12.25 yuan, reaching unprecedented new lows of five pence and 9.75 yuan, respectively. Other exchange rates also suffered similar declines. The black market rates for English and American currency experienced sudden and dramatic changes, even more severe than those of August 8th, causing widespread panic and disorder in the market.</p>
<p>The reasons for this were reportedly twofold: (1) the British attitude at the Tokyo Conference appeared to be softening, and there were rumors of accepted conditions, raising concerns that the silver in the Tianjin concessions might be seized by the Japanese; (2) the use of banknotes issued in the name of North China had been discontinued in the city the day before (although they could be exchanged yesterday, it was only in small amounts). Dealers had two different views: (1) the legal tender’s credit may have been impacted; (2) given that North China banknotes were still being bought in the city at a 5% discount, the rumored large sums of banknotes being transported by the Japanese (reportedly 40 million yuan) could still be used to purchase foreign exchange. To prevent this, HSBC Bank abandoned its June 8th levels of 6.5 pence for English gold and 12.625 yuan for American exchange. In the morning, English gold was initially quoted at 6.5 pence and American exchange at 12.78125 yuan, but these were nominal prices with no actual market activity. Subsequently, external banks engaging in English gold trading drove the price down to a tight five pence. However, HSBC was still willing to supply its regular clients, and money changers and Chinese merchants were also willing to supply, causing the market to recover slightly to 5.5 pence. But relentless selling by Japanese banks drove the price down further, reaching an unprecedented tight price of 4.9375 pence and 9.625 yuan for American exchange, breaking the previous tightest record set around 10:30 AM on June 8th of 6.25 pence and 12.25 yuan. Later, due to a sudden release of currency by external banks, the market recovered, with the closing prices at 5.25 pence for English gold and 11.25 yuan for American exchange. Futures for July and August saw minimal trading due to cautious buying, but the tightness was similar. By the evening close, July English gold was at 5.125 pence and American exchange at 10 yuan. In the afternoon, swap deals for July and August saw active trading, reportedly with one bank offering 4.375 American dollars to Japanese yarn factories, equating to a monthly interest rate of 4.5%. The Hong Kong exchange market was also extremely chaotic, with the final buying price contracting to 36 yuan.</p>
<p>HSBC Revised Quotes Twice, Both Downward</p>
<p>Initially, London spot rates for large transactions decreased by 0.125 and forward rates by 0.1875. New York silver prices remained stable, and London spot gold prices rose by 0.5 pence. The English exchange rate against the US dollar rose by 0.3, against Shanghai by 0.0625, and remained unchanged against the French franc. The US dollar remained unchanged against the English pound, Shanghai yuan, and the French franc. The Central Bank’s official rates for various currencies remained the same as before. In the morning, banks opened with spot selling prices of 6.5625 pence for English gold and 12.78125 yuan for American exchange, unchanged from the previous close. After the opening, foreign firms and other external banks rushed to buy from the Bank of England and HSBC, but HSBC was unwilling to supply and unwilling to offer a higher price, causing panic to erupt and the market to plunge back into chaos. Speculators seized the opportunity to stir up trouble, and foreign firms were willing to pay high prices to buy, but HSBC remained unwilling to supply, causing the market to tighten sharply. It was first heard that the American bank, American Express, sold spot English gold to the Sino-Belgian Bank at a price as low as five pence. When HSBC posted its rates, they unanimously decreased, with English gold decreasing to 5.5 pence and American exchange decreasing slightly to 10.6875 yuan. The announcement of the silver equalization tax remained unchanged, with no tax being levied. It was then heard that HSBC was still willing to supply its regular clients at the quoted prices, so money changers and Chinese merchants stopped buying and started reselling, causing the market to recover slightly. HSBC sold spot English gold at 5.5 pence to foreign firms, including Olyphant and its long-term clients. Subsequently, one bank also sold spot English gold for this month to Sassoon, a Western merchant, at 5.25 pence. Later, money changers and Chinese merchants successively sold spot American exchange to Sino-Italian and Chase banks at 10.075 yuan and 0.5 yuan. Around 10 AM, HSBC's willingness to sell diminished again, and it revised its quotes downward for the second time, with English gold decreasing another half-penny and American exchange decreasing another 0.9375 yuan, causing even greater unease. In addition, the Yokohama Specie Bank suddenly began aggressively buying, causing the market to tighten again, with English gold breaking the major threshold of five pence. The Yokohama Specie Bank bought spot English gold from HSBC at 4.9375 pence, while American exchange also broke into the 10-yuan range, reaching a low of 9.625 yuan. At noon, HSBC's willingness to sell improved, stabilizing the situation slightly. Foreign firms absorbed spot English gold from HSBC at five pence, and spot American exchange at 9.75 yuan. By the noon close, banks' spot selling prices had recovered to 5.3125 pence for English gold and 10.0375 yuan for American exchange.</p>
<p>English, American, and Hong Kong Exchange Rates All Fell Sharply</p>

Foreign firms closed deals with HSBC and Olyphant for spot English gold at 5.21875 and 5.1875 pence. Subsequently, foreign firms also purchased spot American exchange from American banks at 10.025 yuan. Later, Japanese banks bought August American exchange from external banks at 9.5625 yuan. There were some swap deals for July and August, reportedly with one American bank offering Japanese yarn factories 4.375 American dollars, equating to a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of approximately 4.5%. At that time, the spot selling price of Hong Kong exchange at banks had recovered to 36 yuan, but no transactions were reported. By the evening close, banks' spot selling prices were 5.25 pence for English gold and 10.025 yuan for American exchange, with this month's English gold at 5.125 pence and American exchange at 10 yuan.

<h3 id="e50">Foreign Exchange Shrinks Wildly, Gold Rush Re-ignites, Peak Reaching 3,100 Yuan, Creating an Unprecedented Record, The Gold Market Heats Up, Daily Trading Exceeds 2,000 Taels <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot gold market in the city once again erupted in a frenzy of rising prices, soaring upwards without end, breaking the previous high record of 2,702.5 yuan on June 17th, and even crossing the 3,000 yuan mark to reach an unprecedented peak of 3,100 yuan. People from all sides were extremely nervous, and the market was unusually chaotic. The softening of the British position at the Tokyo Conference, and the cessation of the use of North China banknotes the day before, further contributed to the situation. In order to prevent illegal foreign exchange trading, HSBC has abandoned its support level of 6.5 pence for English gold, leading to a wild contraction in foreign exchange. Based on a combined gold price of 5 pence per shilling, the price should be 3,550 yuan. Based on a combined settlement price of 9.75 yuan for American exchange, the price should be 3,602 yuan. As a result, Qian Du's firm already had a tightening wind in foreign exchange in the morning, and even when not calculating the softest prices, was already above 3,000 yuan. Therefore, the price immediately jumped from 2,650 yuan to a buying price of 2,900 yuan, but there were still no sellers, leading the morning open to reach the high threshold of 3,000 yuan. Sellers were all watching from the sidelines, and buyers were anxious, suddenly seeing the price soar to a top price of 3,100 yuan. At this time, gold shop assistants rushed to the market, and the rise was too rapid, causing a temporary decline of 120 yuan to 2,980 yuan. However, with foreign exchange tightening and unable to recover, and HSBC revising the rates downwards for the second time, the buying frenzy was reignited, and Qian Du's firm, gold shops, and silver shops all rushed in, seeing the price rise again to 3,100 yuan. Later, with HSBC supplying according to the second rate, the foreign exchange showed signs of hardening, and the price also retreated to around 3,050 yuan. In the end, it gained over 436 yuan, and trading was quite active, totaling over 2,000 taels. Jewelry gold once soared 50 yuan to reach an unprecedented high price of 315 yuan, and then retreated slightly, still gaining 45 yuan. Sino-British pure gold rose slightly, and customs gold remained stable. Sino-British pure gold, etc., all rose slightly.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Soars Over 400 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels), at around 9:30 AM, the market heard that the Bank of England and HSBC had again stopped supplying foreign firms with settlement funds, so the buying frenzy suddenly increased. First, the buyers offered 2,650 yuan. At that time, a certain money house suddenly shouted the price up to 2,900 yuan to buy, but the sellers, seeing such a crazy situation, did not dare to act easily, so the price was shrouded in a buying frenzy, and then crazily raised another 100 yuan before a deal was seen. A certain gold shop, acting on behalf of the Hua Nan group, bought 50 taels each from money changers and spot gold shops, with the price at 3,000 yuan as the opening price, a sharp increase of 381 yuan compared to the previous close. This was an unprecedented jump since the market began. At the time, it was heard that HSBC's first official rate revision was announced, unanimously decreasing, and people's hearts were even more firm, and sellers were reluctant to sell. The rising wind continued to burn. A certain gold shop, acting on behalf of speculators, aggressively bought over 100 taels, and the price jumped another 60 yuan. A certain gold shop bought 30 taels each from jewelry shop groups and money changers, with the price at 3,060 yuan. Later, wealthy people in the city also came to buy indiscriminately, causing the price to soar another 40 yuan in an instant. Money changers, acting on behalf of wealthy merchants, bought 50 taels from fellow money changers, with the price at 3,100 yuan. At that time, there were many limit-price sellers, and money changers and securities groups were rushing to sell. In addition, a certain silver shop, acting on behalf of a Hong Kong group, sold aggressively at a profit, and the price immediately turned downward. A certain silver shop, acting on behalf of a Hong Kong group, sold 50 taels each to money changers and a certain silver shop, and the price dropped sharply by 100 yuan to 3,000 yuan, and then fell another 20 yuan. A certain silver shop, acting on behalf of a Hong Kong group, sold another 50 taels to a gold shop, with the price at 2,940 yuan, the low for the day. At that time, it was heard that the tightening of foreign exchange was becoming more severe, and it was also heard that HSBC had revised the rates downwards for the second time, so the buying frenzy was re-ignited. A certain silver shop aggressively bought on behalf of foreign banks, so the price immediately recovered outside the 3,000 yuan threshold. Spot gold shops bought 50 taels from jewelry shop groups, with the price at 3,025 yuan, and then soared another 75 yuan, reaching the high peak of 3,100 yuan. A certain silver shop bought 50 taels from jewelry shop groups, with the price at 3,100 yuan. At the time, it was heard that foreign exchange had received HSBC's support and had rebounded, and people's hearts were relieved, and most profit-takers rushed to sell, and the price repeatedly declined. By noon, money changers sold 50 taels to gold shops, with 3,040 yuan as the noon closing price. The afternoon situation was slightly more stable, but the market was still strong. The market opened 20 yuan higher. Money changers bought 50 taels from gold shops, with the price at 3,060 yuan. Later, a certain gold shop absorbed on behalf of speculators, and foreign exchange was reported to be tight, so it gradually rose to 3,072 yuan. At that time, because money changers sold frequently on behalf of retail investors, the price immediately fell back, plunging over 10 yuan. Spot gold shops sold 50 taels to money changers, with the price at 3,055 yuan. After that, the supply and demand were balanced, and the market was quite stable. By the evening close, money changers sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop, with the price at 3,055 yuan. As a result, it gained over 436 yuan, which was unprecedented. The full day had a difference of 120 yuan. The spot gold of the spot gold shop was 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price, and the current standard gold service was about 50 yuan lower than the official rate. According to inquiries, there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Jumps Wildly by 45 Yuan</p>
<p>The price of silver jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged at first. Until 9:45 AM, because spot gold opened with a jump of 381 yuan, it also rose sharply by 40 yuan. At 10:15 AM, the price was raised another 5 yuan. Soon after, at 10:49 AM, because spot gold reached an unprecedented peak of 3,100 yuan, the price was raised another 5 yuan. At that time, Da Tong Heng's price was 315 yuan, an unprecedented record since the market began. Later, because spot gold had a slight rebound, the price was also lowered by 5 yuan at 12:20 PM. There were no changes after that, for a total increase of 45 yuan. Da Tong Heng's revised price was 310 yuan, Xin Tong Heng's price was 308 yuan, and the purchase price was 302 yuan.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Suddenly Rises by Half a Penny</p>
<p>London, 17th - British pure gold suddenly rose by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7, 8 shillings, and 6 pence. As a result, the Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash also increased to 1,212.3 yuan. The official customs gold price remained stable, at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price rose by 4 corners, reaching 1,207.6 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bank drafts and notes rose sharply. The initial rate per thousand yuan was around 110 yuan, and then it rose sharply, reaching 135 yuan by noon.

The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged, at 0.16 yuan for both morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3 id="e52">North China Local Banknotes Can Now Be Exchanged in Small Amounts <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>The Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in the city, in order to prevent a certain party from transporting legal tender from North China to Shanghai to purchase foreign exchange, have stopped accepting North China local banknotes since the day before. However, because there was no prior announcement, it caused panic and disorder in the market. Yesterday, Mr. Ying of this newspaper argued that, at a time when legal tender is unified and there are sufficient reserves, it is best not to distinguish between local banknotes and to continue to accept them all. We should also publish an announcement in the newspaper, limiting the time for exchange, in order to inform the public and avoid losses to the citizens. Yesterday, it was heard that the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications were now exchanging for small amounts. The Bank of China considered the situation and exchanged North China local banknotes under 100 yuan for 1 yuan of legal tender, while the Bank of Communications specially set up an exchange office in the Jing'an Temple branch, with a limit of 10 yuan per person, issuing 1-yuan notes. As for local banknotes from provinces other than North China, such as Chongqing and Fujian, it was heard that the banks in the city were still accepting them all. However, because yesterday was the first day of the exchange, there were many people holding banknotes to exchange at the banks, and the order was inevitably slightly chaotic.</p>
<h3 id="e53">Foreign Currencies Surge Wildly, English and American Gold Sovereigns Rise by Nine Yuan <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold rose by half a penny, and the exchange rates for English and American currencies remained unchanged. The city's foreign exchange market was affected by the tightening of foreign exchange in North China, the purchase of foreign exchange by the Japanese, the refusal of supply by the Sino-British Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee, and the downward revision of rates by Hongfeng Bank. Market prices fluctuated sharply, foreign firms settled accounts very actively, and Western merchants and Japanese banks continued to buy tirelessly, causing the market to be very weak. Yesterday's market prices for English and American gold sovereigns both rose by 9 yuan, the English gold note rose by 8.03 yuan, the American gold note rose by 1.595 yuan, the Hong Kong note rose by 0.48 yuan, the French franc note rose by 0.04 yuan, the Singapore note rose by 0.87 yuan, the Dutch note rose by 0.82 yuan, the Annam note rose by 0.45 yuan, the rupee note rose by 0.58 yuan, the Canadian note rose by 1.57 yuan, the Philippine note rose by 0.77 yuan, the German gold note rose by 0.02 yuan, the Australian gold note rose by 6.3 yuan, the Siamese note rose by 0.1 yuan, and only the Italian note remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e54">Dramatic Changes in the Financial Market Yesterday <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>Following the cessation of the exchange of North China local banknotes the day before, the financial market experienced another huge wave yesterday. To prevent a certain party from taking foreign exchange and to consolidate legal tender, the foreign exchange market saw a drastic contraction. Hongfeng Bank revised its rates downward at around 9:15 AM, with the opening rates being 5.5 pence for the English exchange and 10.5625 yuan for the American exchange. The second rate revision also decreased, with the English exchange at 5 pence and the American exchange at 9.75 yuan. Compared to the rates announced the day before, 6.5 pence for the English exchange and 12.625 yuan for the American exchange, the English exchange fell sharply by 1.5 pence and the American exchange fell by a significant 2.875 American dollars. As a result, the market immediately plunged into chaos. Subsequently, the unofficial market for English exchange also fell to 5.25 pence, hovering between 5.5 pence and 5 pence. In the afternoon, it stabilized at the price of 5.25 pence. The American exchange price was between 10 yuan and 10.25 yuan in the morning, and in the afternoon it also stabilized at the price of 10.25 yuan.</p>
<p>Following the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, the first to be affected was the spot gold market. The spot gold market opened in the morning with a sharp increase. The opening price was 3,000 yuan, compared to the closing price of 2,619 yuan the day before, representing an increase of 381 yuan. The highest price for the whole day reached 3,100 yuan, and the lowest was 2,908 yuan, with a difference of 120 yuan for the whole day, a significant change in recent days. The closing price was 3,055 yuan.</p>
<p>Due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange and the soaring spot gold prices, the general public suspected the credibility of legal tender, and the demand for foreign company stocks and bonds increased sharply. Transactions increased, and all stocks increased. Yihua Yarn Factory's stock reached a high of 20.02 yuan, compared to the highest price of 18.1 yuan the day before, representing an increase of 2.1 yuan. The transaction price of the telephone company's stock was 12.8 yuan, also a few corners higher than the previous day. The unofficial market for bank drafts and discount rates also increased sharply by 28.5 yuan, with the price being over 130 yuan.</p>
<p>Regarding the exchange rates in other ports, Hong Kong's exchange rates for English and American currencies did not change much. The closing price of Shanghai exchange for every 100 yuan of Hong Kong currency was 225.625 yuan of legal tender the day before, and yesterday it rose to 275 yuan, an increase of around 50 yuan. The opening price of the Tianjin exchange rate for English currency yesterday was 4 pence, compared to 0.90625 pence for the 17th. The American exchange rate was 7.75 yuan, compared to 1.8125 American dollars. The exchange rate between Tianjin and Shanghai was 130 yuan, a decrease of 3 yuan compared to the previous day. The price of "United Bank Notes" was 101 yuan (that is, the price of 100 yuan of legal tender), compared to the price of 104.5 yuan on the 17th, representing an increase of 3.5 yuan. Compared to the price of 112 yuan on June 30, it was 11 yuan more expensive. As for commodity prices, everything including cotton yarn, cloth, sugar, hardware, oil, and coal saw a sharp increase.</p>
<h3 id="e55">Securities, Unstable Environment, Government Bond Prices Cannot Withstand Pressure <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's market conditions in the unofficial securities market continued to decline due to weak investor sentiment. In this unstable and ever-changing environment, the general public is at a loss. The issue of interest and principal is still precarious. In addition, the foreign exchange market has undergone a dramatic change, and the spot gold price has risen to 3,100 yuan, an unprecedented high since the world had gold. The relationship between these factors is unique, and the future is still uncertain. The financial world is in an extraordinary turmoil, and the general public is finding it increasingly difficult to obtain financing. The tightness of credit is increasing. Fortunately, government bonds are used as collateral for bank drafts, so even though the discount rate is high, the collateral for bank drafts remains the same. However, there are many parties selling to obtain cash, one after another, and new buyers are becoming increasingly reluctant. The eyes of the major government bond holders are shifting, and the bond market is becoming increasingly depressed. In this shock of financial uncertainty, the trend is not easy to reverse in the short term. The opening price yesterday showed weakness. Although issues 11, 12, and Dafeng were buying, slightly raising the price by 0.1 or 0.2 yuan, there was strong selling pressure. Yuanda, Defu, Xingyuan, Chengyi, and Yongkang were supplying abundantly. Among them, Yuanda's offering was particularly noteworthy. Therefore, the market price could not withstand the pressure and fell by 0.45 to 0.7 yuan. The total number of transactions was approximately 400,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Zhejiang Xingye Bank stock were traded, with a price of 60 yuan per share.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Industry Institute reported that the stock market in the city had been stagnant for a long time. Yesterday, due to the sudden contraction of foreign exchange to around 5 pence, the stock market experienced a dramatic improvement. The prices of various stocks rose sharply. Yihua stock opened at 19 yuan. Due to the purchase of short positions, the price rose rapidly to 21 yuan, then returned to 19.3 yuan. The closing price was also that price, and the buying interest was good. The price fluctuations of various well-known stocks are listed below.</p>
<p>The price of rubber stocks increased because the price of raw rubber materials for forward delivery in New York increased by 20 British pounds, and it was evident that speculators were re-entering the business of raw materials. The statistical position of rubber was strong, and the price in the US market increased.</p>
<p>The prices of London British company stocks in the Far East on the 17th of this month (Monday) were generally stable. Only the price of HSBC Bank shares decreased by one pound each. The price of shares registered in London was £77.5, and the price of shares registered in Hong Kong was £80.</p>
<p>The prices of London Chinese foreign debts on the 17th of this month (Monday) continued to fall by 2 to 3 pounds. The prices of Sino-French American dollars (with seals) and Anglo-French loans (issued in England) each fell by 3 pounds. The market price was 37 pounds. The prices of Anglo-German continued loans and rehabilitation loans issued in England each fell by 2 pounds. The former price was 40 pounds, and the latter price was 30 pounds. The price of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bond also fell by 2 pounds, to a price of 15 pounds. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3 id="e56">Cotton Yarn, Cotton Yarn Market Rises Sharply, Double Horse Reaches a Peak of 508 Yuan, Slightly Declining in the Afternoon Due to Tight Credit <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market, which had been stable for many days, has now had another episode. Unexpectedly, foreign exchange has undergone drastic changes and gold prices have soared, causing generally affluent investors to come and collect cotton yarn again. The rising wind then suddenly rose, but the financial contraction and the bank lending door had long been closed. Even with assets, it is difficult to develop and expand, therefore, investor sentiment is chaotic. Certain major investors are also unable to act due to a lack of capability. Therefore, the market attitude is very calm. 20-count Double Horse once rushed out of the 500-yuan threshold, reaching a maximum peak of 508 yuan. Then, apart from the need from Hong Kong and Yunnan merchants, there was very little new energy. By the time of the closing, there was profit-taking, and the bank draft rate was rising sharply, leading to a decline.</p>
<p>As for current yarn, the market situation at the beginning of the morning was still relatively calm. The opening price was slightly weak, and the price of 20-count Double Horse warehouse orders was 482 yuan, with fellow merchants completing transactions of 10 bales. After a while, the shouting of mobile brokers suddenly increased, and the situation suddenly became tense. Many said that the foreign exchange rate had fallen by more than one penny, and for a time buyers flocked, and the asking price jumped by 10 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 498 yuan, and the price of Shepherd yarn was 405 yuan. But the rumors were numerous, and the momentum was overwhelming, rising another 10 yuan to 508 yuan. The price of warehouse orders was 502 yuan. By the time of the closing, due to the release of many floating profits, there was a slight decline. The current price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 506 yuan, and the price of warehouse orders was 498.5 yuan. It was found that the half-day transaction volume was 1,525 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 17.5 yuan, and the price of Shepherd yarn rose by 14 yuan. In addition, the price of 10-count coarse yarn also rose by 10 yuan. Today, 710 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong. The amount purchased by each merchant is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Fellow merchants 930 Hong Kong 445</p>
<p>Yunnan 150 Statistics 1,525</p>
<p>Also, according to a certain yarn merchant in the afternoon, although the foreign exchange market was very chaotic, the credit crunch was extreme, the discount rate for banknotes was unusually high, and the price of gold had declined. The opening transactions were weaker than in the morning. In fact, the actual purchasing power was still lacking, only speculators were eager to try their luck.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market has recently been affected by the tight credit, and has been ordinary. Suddenly, the exchange rate was revised downward, and investor sentiment increased, and speculators became more active. The market price then increased. The current price of 20-count Yueqin yarn is 410 yuan, a jump of 10 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e57">The Cotton Trade is Quiet <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>The cotton trade had a slight transaction, only eighty bales of "Huoji" cotton were sold at a price of eighty-six yuan (banknotes). The same firms bought it and handed it over to the warehouses. According to the prices, there was not much difference from the market price of the previous day. Judging from the situation today, it should have risen in price, but the factories are unwilling to take any action in this chaotic state, and the legal tender position is becoming tighter, so the transaction is still quiet. As for the foreign cotton situation, calculated according to the drastic changes in the foreign exchange rate, the price of each picul of cotton has jumped by more than twenty yuan, but in this environment, no one is interested. Due to the sunny weather and calm seas, the transportation from Subei has resumed, and the number of cotton shipments has increased. 528 bales of "Tonghua" cotton arrived at the dock:</p>
<p>Pengjiapu　92.50　Bought by the same firm</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton　91.00　Another 500 pieces　100 bales delivered to the banknote warehouse　Remittances again</p>
<p>The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai was affected because the banknotes of place names in North China could not be used in the market the day before yesterday, and the finance experienced drastic changes yesterday. HSBC and other banks refused to supply foreign exchange. Yesterday, the new low price of 4-bit cotton was as low as 375, and the legal tender price per picul rose sharply by more than twenty yuan, and the discount rate also increased. According to this situation, foreign cotton transactions may disappear.</p>
<p>Regarding the foreign cotton market prices, the New York cotton market first fell due to telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai reporting declines, which triggered the closing of recent long positions. However, the future prices are still firm. Although cotton area reports indicate that cotton harvest may be affected due to pests, the weak spot prices in the South offset this favorable news for long positions. As a result, New York cotton prices fell by six or seven points, Indian cotton prices, including forecasts, fell by one rupee, and Egyptian cotton prices fell by eight points.</p>
<h3 id="e58">Food: Changshu Special Japonica Rice opens at 20 Yuan <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, the supply of river rice has gradually increased. Yesterday, a total of nine loads of early and late rice from Nanbang arrived from Hexia, and 1,300 to 1,400 packages of Changzhou and Fengjing goods of "Chelin Baozi" arrived. After the sluggish market conditions gradually stabilized yesterday, the temporary suspension of the use of North China banknotes and foreign exchange issues boosted people's confidence yesterday. The shops in this street have chosen to buy cheap and readily available goods, and the inland merchants have also bought special goods, so the wholesalers and retailers have all raised their prices, and the market has suddenly shown a rising trend. The price of Changshu special japonica rice has opened at 20 yuan, and other medium and thick japonica rice have also increased by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan. Doyangbu special rice has also followed suit, while only "Bianwu" rice is sluggish and still mediocre. According to statistics, the total transaction volume in the city is more than 20,000 piculs.</p>
<h3 id="e59">Sugar Market: White Sugar Rises More <a href="#e59" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c59" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">59</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was affected by the contraction of the British exchange rate, and the London sugar price also rebounded. The August price was 7 shillings and 4 pence, up 1.5 pence, and the forward price rose slightly to 0.25. The December price was 6 shillings and 2.5 pence, and the March price of the following year was 6 shillings, 3.25 pence.

<h3 id="e60">Hong Kong Telegram: Shanghai Restricts Supply, Black Market Foreign Exchange Collapses Yesterday; [This] Is to Prevent Huge Arbitrage Purchases; However, Legitimate Needs Are Still Sold; The Market Shows a Slight Appearance of Unease <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>London, 18th Telegram: Today's sharp fall in Chinese legal tender is due to the fact that the Sino-British Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee stopped selling pounds sterling, making transactions of Chinese legal tender in London almost exhausted. Banks here believe that they are inconvenient to risk overnight fluctuations and purchase a large amount of legal tender, so only a small number of legal tender transactions were concluded, mostly funds withdrawn from China. However, most British people who hold Chinese legal tender prefer to keep the funds in China temporarily to wait for the exchange rate to improve, rather than convert them into pounds sterling at present and suffer significant losses. London banks stated that they are unwilling to help speculators who are unfavorable to Chinese currency, because this kind of behavior will further weaken the strength of the stabilization fund. Although Sino-British financiers here believe that Chinese legal tender must find its own exchange rate level, they are all surprised by the current sharp fall. As for what is the level of Chinese legal tender, it is a matter of speculation by the general public. How it will turn out will largely depend on the political and economic trends of the "China Incident" (Reuters)</p>
<p>After the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee maintained the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai, the British HSBC Bank still provided as much as possible for the legitimate needs of various industries, so the foreign exchange black market stabilized at the so-called new level, that is, 6.5 pence for British exchange and 12.625 yuan for US exchange. Today, in order to prevent huge arbitrage purchases, it is necessary to appropriately restrict supply. Therefore, the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai has shrunk wildly since yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Black Market Collapses Wildly Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>At 9:00 am yesterday, the British HSBC Bank's foreign exchange listed prices (ie, the so-called black market foreign exchange price) shrank to 5.5 pence for British exchange and 10.6875 yuan for US exchange. At 10:00 am, the second round of listed prices shrank to 5 pence for British exchange and 9.75 yuan for US exchange. At the same time, HSBC, Chartered Bank, Citibank, and other banks have strict restrictions on requests to purchase foreign exchange. All normal merchants who want to apply for purchase must have an order form as proof, otherwise, they will be refused to purchase.</p>
<p>Restricting Supply Causes Market Chaos</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Shanghai foreign exchange black market has been able to remain stable at the new level thanks to the maintenance of the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee. Today, in order to prevent illegal arbitrage of the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, it had to appropriately restrict it since yesterday morning, not stop the supply. Since the British HSBC Bank strictly restricted the supply of Shanghai foreign exchange black market, speculators took the opportunity to spread rumors, resulting in abnormal chaos in the foreign exchange black market, and the number of "pajie" (brokers) increased one after another for a time.</p>
<p>Legitimate Needs Are Still Supplied</p>
<p>Later, HSBC and other banks still provided as much as possible to those who have legitimate needs, so the market calmed down slightly, and foreign exchange prices turned loose, resulting in British exchange standing at 5.25 pence and US exchange at 10.25 yuan. It is said that the foreign exchange in the black market may stabilize at the above-mentioned market prices, and some people say that this is another new level. Moreover, the foreign exchange black market in Shanghai should not be maintained again, but the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee still finds ways to maintain it, and only restricts the supply in order to take care of the difficulties of merchants.</p>
<p>The Legal Exchange Rate Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance announced the rules for applying for foreign exchange for imported goods, all non-prohibited essential imports can apply to the Chongqing Foreign Exchange Examination Committee to purchase foreign exchange, which will be supplied by the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications in accordance with the legal rate. However, the applicant must pay a balance fee equal to the difference between the legal rate and the listed price of the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications. Therefore, the import of essential goods no longer needs to be purchased from the black market. As for the legal foreign exchange rate of the Central Bank, it remains unchanged, for example, the one announced yesterday was 1 shilling and 2.5 pence for British exchange and 30 US dollars for US exchange.</p>
<p>Preventing Arbitrage and Prohibiting the Import of Goods</p>
<p>Regarding the customs of the occupied areas, such as Shanghai, Tianjin, etc., because the government's power is not enough, the method of prohibiting the import of goods cannot be implemented, so luxury goods and non-essential goods can still be imported from the occupied areas and supplied to the people in the occupied areas for consumption. However, the foreign exchange for the imported goods must be purchased from the black markets in Shanghai and Tianjin, etc. This decision by Hong Kong to further restrict the supply of the Shanghai black market foreign exchange is to prevent arbitrage by a certain party and the import of luxury goods.</p>
<p>Prices of Imported Goods Soar</p>
<p>Since the black market price of foreign exchange has collapsed, the prices of imported goods such as paper, sugar, medicines, pigments, soap, candles, oils, tobacco, foreign wines, etc., have soared by 20% to 30% yesterday. And most merchants who operate foreign goods do not allow large-scale sales. At the same time, the prices of domestic goods have also risen, creating a deformed phenomenon in Shanghai's commodity prices. Speculators take the opportunity to hoard domestic goods in order to make huge profits, and the people's livelihood is greatly affected. Therefore, it is hoped that all industries will not arbitrarily raise prices.</p>
<p>Cash Soars, Remittance Discount</p>
<p>The cash black market soared yesterday due to the sharp contraction of the black market foreign exchange, and even broke the 3,000 yuan mark, creating an unprecedented new high price, which has never been seen in the history of gold. The listed prices of various silver shops have also increased to 310 yuan. Regarding the remittance discount, although it is an improper business and has been repeatedly ordered by the government to ban it, the general small money exchange shops still defy the order and operate the discount. Yesterday, due to the general need for cash to arbitrage foreign exchange and hoard goods, the demand in the market exceeded the supply, and the discount soared to 135 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e61">The Sino-Japanese Currency War <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>The English "Ta Mei Wan Bao" (North China Daily News) said that the Hong Kong Sino-British Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee today (18th) telegraphed HSBC and Chartered Bank to stop selling foreign exchange for legal tender pre-purchases or cash purchases. The Sino-Japanese currency war has gone a step further. The impact of this new defense measure by the Equalization Fund Committee has been deeply felt in Shanghai this morning. The legal tender exchange rate has fallen from the level of 6 pence 5 to 5 pence. At 9:00 am, the British exchange rate was 5 pence, and the US exchange rate was 9 yuan 75. In other words, one US dollar is equivalent to 9 yuan 7.5 jiao legal tender, and one pound is equivalent to 48 yuan. The lowest value this morning was 4 pence 9375. Then speculators and exporters sold slightly, and as a result, the market became slightly firm, and the exchange rate rose to 5 pence and 10 yuan 75. However, most foreign banks only nominally quoted market prices and refused to sell to anyone other than their customers, causing the exchange rate to fall back to the opening level. At noon, the exchange rate returned to 5 pence 3125 and 10 yuan 375.</p>
<p>Since the legal tender exchange rate has fallen again, if it does not return to its previous level, it is expected that the Shanghai commodity prices, which have recently risen sharply, will rise to a higher level in the next few days. Yesterday, the British exchange rate in Tianjin was only 4 pence 75. If Japanese banks and other speculators can obtain foreign exchange in the local market with the legal tender issued in North China, they will be able to make a profit of 13 percent. The losers are the government bank and its exchange reserves. Yesterday (17th), Shanghai was already under pressure due to a large number of offers.</p>
<p>Most Chinese banks refused to accept any banknotes printed with place names such as Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, and Shandong. The yen exchange rate in this city did not benefit from the fall in the legal tender exchange rate, and indirectly made the value of its easy foreign currency fall. Exchange shops buy yen for 1 yuan of legal tender and sell it for 1 yuan and 1 jiao. There was almost no change in yesterday's exchange rate. The price of ten-ounce gold bars reached 3,100 yuan this morning</p>
<p>The highest level. The black market opened at 3,000 yuan, then reached an unprecedented high of 3,100 yuan, and closed at 3,040 yuan. This morning, everyone knew that the Tianjin banknotes issued by the bank could be exchanged for banknotes in this city. No less than 200 people crowded at the traffic branch on Jing'an Temple Road. In addition to the dumping of banknotes from various banks in North China in the local market, one reason for the suspension of foreign exchange sales by the management fund is that in the second week of June, the</p>
<p>The low exchange rate was still not enough to discourage those who pre-purchased foreign exchange. Under these circumstances, the Hong Kong Fund felt it appropriate to suspend the sale of foreign exchange at least until the Shanghai exchange market saw a new natural level of legal tender to foreign currency. The exchange market this morning was completely unstable. Undoubtedly, the Hong Kong Fund will sooner or later intervene again and resume the sale of foreign exchange for legal tender, but no one dares to predict when it will</p>
<p>Resume selling foreign exchange without restrictions, or whether it will implement the sale of foreign exchange only for certain designated imported goods. The Japanese attempt to exchange huge amounts of North China legal tender into foreign exchange in Shanghai seems to be the direct reason why the Equalization Committee refused to sell it this morning. It is heard from reliable sources that Japanese banks have shipped no less than 50 million yuan of North China legal tender from Tianjin, willing to exchange it for foreign exchange at any value.</p>

<h3 id="e63">North China Place Name Small Denomination Banknotes: Central Bank and Bank of Communications Exchange as Much as Possible; Shanghai Banks Meet and Negotiate Proper Methods; Intend to Only Allow Exchange of One Yuan Notes; Various Miscellaneous Banknotes Continue to Circulate as Usual <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>After the banks, money shops, companies, shops and cigarette shops in the Shanghai market refused to accept banknotes with place names in North China such as Tianjin from the day before yesterday, yesterday morning many people who held banknotes of the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications with place names in North China went to the China Communications Bank to exchange them. The authorities of the two banks therefore decided to restrict the acceptance of banknotes with place names in North China, aiming to prevent them from being transported to Shanghai to arbitrage foreign exchange. Therefore, for retail minorities at the counter, they have been as accommodating as possible to exchange them. Therefore, all those who hold less than 100 yuan are allowed to exchange legal tender with Shanghai place names, and additional personnel are assigned to help handle the exchange matters.</p>
<p>Other Miscellaneous Banknotes Continue to Circulate as Usual</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from relevant parties yesterday that after the Ministry of Finance unified the issuance, the Issuance Preparation Management Committee was established to manage it. The cash in its issuance preparation has always been above 60%, which has won the trust of Chinese and foreign people. The banknotes issued by Zhejiang Xingye, the Fourth Bank's Zhongnan, China Reclamation, China Industrial, China Agricultural and Industrial, Zhejiang Local, Agricultural and Commercial, and other banks are all taken over by the Issuance Preparation Management Committee, so these banknotes have been circulating in the same way as legal tender. In addition to North China place names, banknotes with place names such as Hankou, Zhejiang, and Zhe-Su are still accepted by various banks as usual.</p>
<p>Shanghai Banks Have Telegraphed Head Office for Instructions</p>
<p>This restriction on the exchange of North China place name banknotes by the China Communications Bank is temporary and is an emergency measure. The two branch offices have telegraphed the head office for instructions on how to proceed, and will follow the instructions after receiving the reply. However, in order to stabilize the market, it has been exchanging as much as possible for retail minorities since yesterday. It is heard that the two banks exchanged a total of 200,000 yuan of banknotes with North China place names yesterday. Starting this morning, they decided to continue to accept and exchange them. Even if legitimate merchants hold more than 100 yuan of North China place name banknotes, they will be accommodated for exchange.</p>
<p>China and Bank of Communications Draft Resolutions</p>
<p>The vice-managers of the Shanghai branches of the China Communications Bank had an informal meeting yesterday, and it is heard that they will plan a proper method. However, this method will be implemented after the head office approves it. According to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency who learned from relevant parties, in the future, those who hold banknotes with place names from other provinces and want to exchange them at the China Communications Bank will only be allowed to exchange them for one yuan notes, because one yuan notes are quite inconvenient in terms of procedures for purchasing foreign exchange, and foreign banks do not allow the acceptance of large amounts of one yuan notes, which aims to prevent them from arbitraging foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Black Market Foreign Exchange Purchases Limited to Central Bank, Bank of Communications</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from foreign merchant banks yesterday that the foreign merchant banks on the Bund, such as HSBC Chartered Bank, Citibank Bank, etc., have long limited the acceptance of banknotes to the legal tender of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications. Banknotes with place names from other places and banknotes from other banks have long been rejected. Therefore, those who want to arbitrage foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market must use the legal tender of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications with Shanghai place names in advance.</p>
<p>North China Banknotes Transported to Shanghai for Arbitrage</p>
<p>It is rumored in the Yuh Rong market that a huge amount of banknotes with place names in North China such as Tianjin will arrive in Shanghai by special round trip, totaling 30 to 40 million yuan, attempting to arbitrage foreign exchange in the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, because the Chinese government no longer maintains the foreign exchange of Tianjin since the area was occupied, so the exchange rate has fallen, and the British exchange rate has shrunk to about 4 yuan, and the US exchange rate has shrunk to 9 yuan. At the same time, the exchange rate between Shanghai and Tianjin is that more than 1,300 yuan in Tianjin is only equivalent to 1,000 yuan in Shanghai, so the profit from transporting banknotes from Tianjin to Shanghai is greater than that of goods.</p>
<p>Small Money Shops Actually Buy and Profit</p>
<p>Small money shops that operate speculation and are not members of the Money Exchange Industry Association actually took the opportunity to privately buy banknotes with place names from other places at a discount of 1 jiao to 3 jiao per yuan when the China Communications Bank restricted the exchange of banknotes with place names from North China. After receiving these banknotes, they ordered their apprentices to exchange them at the China Communications Bank, aiming to profit. It is hoped that ticket holders will not be fooled by this improper business. Therefore, the temporary restriction on exchange by the China Communications Bank is to prevent transportation and arbitrage, and there is definitely no problem with these banknotes.</p>

<p>The British company's Sudan mail ship, which came to Shanghai from London and went to Japan, returned to Dagukou, Tianjin on the 7th of this month, intending to load fees, but was repeatedly embarrassed by the Japanese side, which delayed the return voyage to Europe. Last Saturday, the company said that the Dagukou affair had ended, and it was scheduled to come to Shanghai from Tianjin on Sunday and change the ship from Shanghai today to return to Europe with cargo, etc., which has been recorded in the previous report. However, until last night, the ship had not yet arrived in Shanghai, and it is also impossible to return to Europe today. When asked the company, the reply was still unclear. It can be seen that the ship's Dagukou affair has not yet been cleared up. Although the company has rescheduled the ship to return to Europe from Shanghai on Friday, it is still difficult to predict whether it will be implemented.</p>

<p>According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 6:00 am yesterday, the hurricane that originated east of Luzon Island in the Pacific Ocean has advanced to 20 degrees north latitude and 128 degrees east longitude. The center of the wind is within 120 nautical miles and is advancing in a north-northwest direction. According to the observatory's report at 5:00 pm yesterday, the new hurricane advanced to 22 degrees north latitude and 128 degrees east longitude at 2:00 pm. The center of the wind is within 60 nautical miles and is advancing rapidly in a due north or north-west direction.</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Are Threatened</p>
<p>It is found that the typhoon has advanced 120 nautical miles within 8 hours from 6:00 am yesterday to 2:00 pm. The speed of the wind is extremely fast. The current location is in the southern part of the Ryukyu Islands. Because its movement has a tendency to head north-west, the coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are threatened, and Shanghai is also its target, so it is worth paying attention to. The highest temperature in this city yesterday was 87.1 degrees, and the lowest was 75.2 degrees.</p>

<p>Shanghai's import surplus is becoming increasingly serious, and the biggest reason for creating a huge import surplus figure is the massive import of cotton. According to Customs statistics, Shanghai imported Indian cotton, American cotton, and Egyptian cotton totaling more than 59 million yuan in the first five months of this year, which is six times more than the same period last year. The consumption of cotton in Shanghai after the war</p>
<p>There is such a huge number, which is actually a bad phenomenon. The biggest consumers are Japanese yarn factories. At present, there are more than 1.3 million spindles in Japanese-owned yarn factories in Shanghai, and only about 500,000 spindles in Chinese-owned yarn factories. Part of the cotton and cotton cloth woven by Japanese merchants is sold in the occupied areas. Although Japanese yarn is cheaper than Chinese yarn, the Chinese government strictly prohibits the import of Japanese yarn in various places, so part of it is re-exported from Shanghai back to its country to replace domestic production. The intention is to use cheap Chinese labor and Japanese puppet banknotes.</p>
<p>Exchange Legal Tender</p>
<p>Exchange foreign currency in Shanghai market with legal tender, order and import. After the Chinese government has implemented exchange rate adjustment, devalued the black market exchange rate, and restricted withdrawals and tightened the legal tender position, Japanese merchants in Shanghai have been forced to cancel part of their cotton purchase contracts. The result will be to reduce the larger amount of cotton imports in the coming months, and to increase cotton costs and increase costs. The promotion of Japanese banknotes at depreciated prices will also be hit, and Chinese yarn factories will benefit greatly.</p>

<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that a spokesperson for the British Embassy in Shanghai has denounced a piece of news widely circulated yesterday (the 17th) by a certain Japanese news agency as "a tissue of lies." The news alleged that the Japanese authorities in Tianjin had obtained direct evidence of British involvement in a conspiracy to disrupt the peace in the Tianjin area. It claimed a British ringleader was working for the Chiang regime within the concession, and the British authorities were allowing the direction of Chinese guerrillas and the supply of weapons from within the concession. One of the specific accusations in the report was that, following a meeting between British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr and General Chiang Kai-shek, a special envoy was dispatched to Tianjin.

A unit of Chinese troops, on the night of the 15th, once again destroyed over a dozen sections of track between Chang'an and Xiashi. The damage was discovered by Japanese troops, who dispatched railway workers for repairs. However, a passenger train from Hangzhou to Shanghai was held up in Chang'an for over four hours. Consequently, Japanese troops along both lines have recently initiated so-called "mopping-up" operations, leading to a highly unsettling situation.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Shanghai Delegation of Representatives to Extend Comfort and Appreciation to the Troops; All Members Returned to Shanghai; Traveled Through Seven Provinces, Approaching the Front Lines Dozens of Times; Excellent Impression, Shortage of Daily Necessities in the Army <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Delegation of Representatives, organized by various groups in the city, departed last autumn and traveled from eastern Zhejiang to the front lines in western Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and western Jiangxi. They represented all sectors of Shanghai in extending comfort and appreciation to the military and political leaders and soldiers fighting the war, distributing the gifts of appreciation they carried to the officers and men. The group consisted of over twenty people.</p>
<p>Endured Many Hardships</p>
<p>Subsequently, they traveled through Hunan to various locations in the northwest to continue their work. A portion of the delegation, due to being unable to acclimatize, returned to Shanghai last winter. The remaining dozen or so individuals, led by Team Leader Chen, reached the northwest through snowy and icy conditions, and finally returned to Shanghai entirely at the end of last month. According to a member of the delegation who spoke to reporters, they traveled through seven provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, and Shaanxi.</p>
<p>Approaching the Front Lines</p>
<p>Dozens of times, the soldiers fighting on the front lines were extremely excited and warmly welcomed the delegation from Shanghai. In addition to inquiring about the war situation, they conveyed the expectations of all sectors of Shanghai, leaving an excellent impression. The journey from Jiangxi to northern Shaanxi was the most difficult and dangerous. When they were in Jiangxi, the Japanese army was launching a major offensive on Yuezhou, and it was also bitterly cold. Almost the entire journey</p>
<p>Was in the War Zone.</p>
<p>Fortunately, many of the members were strong and fit, so they were able to complete the mission safely. When the delegation left Shaanxi, Team Leader Chen decided to go to Sichuan to join another delegation and continue his work, so he did not return to Shanghai. The most important news we bring is that there is a significant shortage of daily necessities on the front lines, such as cotton undershirts, tooth powder, straw sandals, and the like.</p>

<p>Since the Japanese warships gathered along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, with certain intentions, the Chinese troops have maintained strict defenses, making it difficult for the Japanese army to launch a large-scale invasion. Currently, in addition to strengthening defenses, the military authorities are considering restoring shipping on the Shanghai-Zhejiang routes. According to a certain bank that recently received news from eastern Zhejiang, the Japanese army's attempt to invade eastern Zhejiang has failed due to restraints from various parties. In recent days, Japanese aircraft have been active in Jinhua, Wenling, Yongjia, Lishui, Shaoxing, and other counties. According to the authorities, these actions by the Japanese army are entirely for creating a false impression, with the intention of disrupting the market. However, the situation in eastern Zhejiang remains very calm, and there is no panic in the face of the Japanese aircraft's threats.</p>

<p>Zhao Wenyuan, age 34, from Tai County, residing at 3001 Dinghai Road, has recently been luring a large number of underage girls from rural areas to Shanghai, sending them to work in various factories. Although Zhao provides these girls with food and clothing, all of the wages earned by the girls are taken by Zhao, ostensibly as repayment for their room and board. However, Zhao's treatment of the girls is extremely abusive.</p>
<p>They are not given enough to eat, and there is often no food to eat with the rice. Even when the girls are ill, they are forced to work as usual. If they do not comply, they are subjected to physical abuse. Zhao's behavior is no different than that of a prostitute's pimp, and the girls, despite experiencing much suffering, are unable to escape Zhao's control because Zhao possesses hidden power. Zhu Meiying (age 15), from Tai County, was also lured by Zhao. Unable to endure the suffering any longer, she seized an opportunity to escape on the 15th of this month and went to the No. 13 Pier on the Bund, intending to board a boat to return to her hometown. Unexpectedly, Zhao suddenly tracked her down and forced her to return home. When the girl refused,</p>
<p>A dispute arose. Chinese Constable No. 887 investigated and brought them both back to the Central Police Station. After questioning by the police chief, Zhao was reprimanded and released, while the girl was sent to the Poor Girls' Rescue Society for assistance. Unexpectedly, yesterday Zhao forced Zhu Zhuying, the girl's sister, to go to the police station to try to take the girl back. After investigation by Chinese Detective Yang Zaishan, Zhao's atrocities were uncovered, and he was arrested. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to Criminal Court No. 1 of the First Special District Court. Police attorney Ru Baoyi filed charges under Article 286 of the Criminal Code, stating that there were over twenty girls under Zhao's control, and further investigation was needed, requesting a postponement for further questioning. Judge Feng Shide approved the report and questioned Zhao briefly, then ordered him to be remanded in custody and postponed the trial.</p>

It is alleged that the plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant Wang Liwu on August 20, 1928, to purchase a building numbered 16 Zhengping Village on land located at 9794 and 9797 Rue Foch. The agreed price was 2,100 yuan, with a deposit of 700 yuan paid in advance, for which the defendant issued a receipt. The contract stipulated that construction would begin on September 15 of the same year and the property would be delivered in October. However, construction was delayed,</p>
<p>And repeated demands were ineffective. The plaintiff's family members had already arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong and were forced to rent a temporary residence, incurring a monthly rent of 40 yuan. Letters demanding delivery of the property were sent on February 16 and April 13 of this year, but the defendant only verbally stated that he could not deliver the property. The plaintiff demanded the return of the deposit, but the defendant requested a delay in payment. The defendant did not respond to the letters. The plaintiff later discovered that the defendant had not obtained the land rights and had not applied to the Shanghai Municipal Council for a</p>
<p>Construction permit. The plaintiff sued, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay double the deposit and damages in accordance with the law. The court, upon receiving the petition, held several hearings with Judge Ma Yishu presiding. The defendant argued that the delay was due to the inability to obtain a construction permit. The case was debated and concluded, and yesterday morning, Judge Li Liang, acting on behalf of Civil Court No. 7, ruled that the Zhenxing Company must deliver the building numbered 16 Zhengping Village on land located at</p>
<p>9794 and 9797 Rue Foch to the plaintiff within two months. If the defendant is unable to deliver the aforementioned property, he must return double the deposit in national currency, amounting to 1,400 yuan. If the assets of the Zhenxing Company are insufficient to pay the debt, Wang Liwu and Han Zhengping shall be jointly and severally liable for the payment. The litigation costs shall be borne by the defendant.</p>

<p>Connaught Village on Connaught Road in the British Concession (owned by the Wufeng Qianzhuang) consists of over thirty buildings. The residents are mostly factory laborers. There is an artesian well in the village, and each household pays an additional water fee of two yuan per month.

Recently, the landlord notified all residents that the rent would be increased by 30% starting this month. Due to the rising cost of living and the intermittent water supply, the tenants are often in arrears with their rent, and the rent increase is beyond their means. Therefore, they held a meeting yesterday to establish the Connaught Village Tenants' Association, intending to request the assistance of organizations such as the Ratepayers' Association, the Citizens' Association, and the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department to negotiate, in order to prevent the landlord from illegally raising rents and to demand that the water supply be maintained as much as possible to facilitate their residence.</p>

<p>Yuanhua, the abbot of the Sanjiao Leshan Temple at the intersection of Avenue Joffre (present-day Avenue Huaihai) and Route Cardinal Mercier (present-day Avenue Ruijin), was recently sued in the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court by Qinliang, the abbot of Jingci Temple in Hangzhou, through a lawyer for offenses such as hindering freedom. It was stated that the plaintiff came to Shanghai to avoid the war and, last month, upon the introduction of a friend, bought a plot of land of 4.9 li and a house at No. 9 Chengde Lane on the same land from Yeguang Company for use as a branch temple of Jingci Temple. However, the defendant had previously disputed the property rights with Yeguang Company, and after three trials, a judgment was made for a public auction according to the law. At that time, because no one bid, the transfer was made to Yeguang Company. When the plaintiff bought the property, he thought the procedures were complete and he could naturally manage the property. Unexpectedly, the defendant dared to occupy the property even after the execution and refused to hand it over despite repeated urging. According to the complaint, the court summoned the defendant Yuanhua for interrogation in the Second Criminal Court yesterday by Judge Li. The defendant Yuanhua's testimony was evasive, so the court immediately sentenced him in court. The main text of the judgment stated: "The defendant Yuanhua is guilty of hindering the freedom of others and is sentenced to three months of imprisonment."</p>

<h3 id="e103">Japanese Planes Bomb Chengdu - Targets All Belong to West China University - Flight Path Directly Over the Entire Campus - British and American Nationals Write to Shanghai's Western Newspapers - Japanese Claim of Erroneous Trajectory Debunked <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>The China Press reports that four foreigners in Chengdu wrote to the China Press on the 11th of June regarding the Japanese bombing. They explicitly denied the Japanese official claim that the bombing of West China Union University in Chengdu that day was accidental. The names of the eyewitnesses cannot be disclosed for obvious reasons, but they are two Americans, one Briton, and one Canadian, all of whom are reliable. According to the letter, the Japanese planes failed to hit any of the targets they claimed to be bombing and, moreover, directly attacked foreign missionary property. The following is a comparison of the Japanese official view contained in the letter from the Japanese Consul-General in Hankou to the US Consul-General and the testimony of eyewitnesses. The Japanese report stated that the main targets of the Japanese planes were the headquarters of the 28th Army and the Provincial Government Office, and that they were pleased to note that most of the bombs directly hit or came very close to the targets. The foreign report stated that none of the Japanese targets were hit or damaged. The closest bomb fell 400 meters away from the target. The Japanese view continued that, unfortunately, one bomb went off course and hit the central building of West China Union University. The China Press replied that at least four bombs, at most, "went off course" and destroyed the school building. Furthermore, at least ten more bombs fell outside the city and near the university. The Japanese explained how "one bomb" "went off course" as follows: As the Japanese planes approached the city, they encountered a number of Chinese fighter planes and heavy anti-aircraft fire, which forced them to dodge the shells and fight the Chinese planes while carrying out the bombing. Foreign eyewitnesses refuted this claim, stating that many</p>
<p>British and American expatriates watched the Japanese planes come and go, and were completely unaware of any anti-aircraft fire before the Japanese planes bombed, and that the Japanese planes were only intercepted after the bombing. If they were "dodging," the Japanese planes should not have maintained formation in the city's skies, but should have scattered. The Japanese Consul-General's letter concluded by stating that the bombed areas were always along the</p>
<p>flight path, and that the Japanese planes chose the route with the least possible chance of any bombs falling on the university. The China Press's report stated that, regardless of the original plan, eyewitness testimony and the evidence of bomb craters proved that the flight path went directly over the school buildings, and that the school buildings were not on the edge of the affected area, but an important part of the bombed area.</p>

<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>The level of knowledge of the people of our country is too low, and there are various bad habits in society that have been brewing for a long time, weakening the country, and leading to today's national crisis. In order to rectify the source and clear the stream, so as to enhance the strength of the country during this critical period and to seek the permanent development of the country after the overall situation is stable, the only way is to instill scientific common sense in the people and thoroughly reform the corrupt and decadent society so that there is a new and ever-changing atmosphere. This is what every patriotic youth should strive for today. The degeneration of our country's society is all due to the lack of scientific common sense. For example, the superstition of ghosts and gods and the seeking of immortals and divination are still popular in the country, and the cost of incense, firecrackers, tin foil, and paper money each year is nearly tens of millions of yuan. The country's huge resources are wasted on meaningless consumption, which undermines the country's strength and makes it a laughingstock to foreigners. If the people have scientific common sense, such losses can be reduced to zero. People's ignorance of hygiene and dislike of cleanliness easily leads to the spread of diseases. The diet prefers the use of white rice that has been milled too finely, sacrificing the quality of nutrition and not knowing how to match economic and balanced foods, and their physical strength is gradually declining. And ignorant farmers and wealthy villagers in the countryside like their children to marry early, resulting in congenital deficiencies, and even the entire nation has a tendency to become weak. If they have scientific common sense, they will know that such blind actions will harm themselves and the country, and the people will warn each other and dare not commit them. Moreover, because the people have no knowledge, their skills for making a living and their morality as human beings are declining day by day. With so many unhealthy citizens, the country is bound to suffer in an era of national emergency. If scientific common sense can penetrate into the people, and if the people are aware of the inevitability of the survival of the fittest, they will encourage each other to strive for survival, their outlook on life will be very correct, and everyone will be a responsible citizen, and the country will naturally have no internal worries or external troubles. The above points are all the most obvious ones. In fact, due to the lack of scientific development, the harm suffered by the country and society is unknown. In view of this, we can know that if we want to establish a long-lasting foundation for the country, we must rely on the improvement of society. If we want to improve society, we only hope that the ambitious youth in the country will devote themselves to science and disseminate as much as possible to people the scientific common sense that can address the chronic diseases of society. Although it is extremely critical today, it is extremely great to consolidate the country's vitality and promote the people's sense of responsibility and struggle. I hope that patriotic people will not regard this as a slow plan, but will quickly catch up, overcome all difficulties, and be the vanguard of social reform.</p>
<h3 id="e113">The First Living Thing <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>— Guo Xiguan</p>
<p>Life phenomena are like candle flames, with a constant shape on the outside, but constantly changing on the inside. This change can be observed from two aspects: one is construction (Anabolism) and the other is destruction (Katabolism). Taking in external substances to create the body is construction; breaking down the body and expelling it from the body is destruction; together they are called metabolism. Whether construction or destruction, both are work. Work must rely on energy to be completed. Life phenomena are the expression of energy. The energy during destruction comes from the static energy (Potential Energy) inside the body. This static energy is created by living things taking in external kinetic energy (Kinitio Energy) and transforming it into storage during construction.</p>
<p>From the perspective of acquiring energy, living things can be divided into two major categories: dependent and independent. Independent types, such as green plants, can take in external kinetic energy - sunlight - and transform it into static energy for storage. Dependent types, such as animals and plants without chlorophyll, cannot. Therefore, chlorophyll is a key element in fixing kinetic energy. Living things with this can survive independently; otherwise, they live a dependent life. However, there are several kinds of bacteria in the soil, such as nitrifying bacteria, iron bacteria, sulfur bacteria, etc., each of which can use the energy released during the oxidation of nitrogen compounds, iron compounds, sulfur compounds, etc., to produce food, and fix its kinetic energy for storage, for use during destruction. Therefore, although these bacteria do not have chlorophyll, they can survive independently.</p>
<p>According to the theory of evolution, all kinds of living things existing on Earth today evolved from simpler ones. The smallest unit of living things is the cell. No matter how simple, it should have at least one cell. Therefore, the first living things to appear on Earth should have been single-celled organisms. After a long period of elimination and evolution, today's Earth is dominated by higher organisms. However, single-celled organisms, such as the aforementioned bacteria, still have many species and numbers in this world, and biologists have even established special departments to study them in depth. We already know that the existing living things are all evolved from single-celled organisms. Although we cannot immediately say that the first living things to appear on Earth were the same as a certain existing single-celled organism, it is a very interesting question to infer from the vast array of existing heterogeneous species a type that is most likely to have occurred "for the first time" in the primitive era.</p>
<p>We must know that the living things most likely to have occurred in the primitive era would have been those that lived an independent life, so animals are definitely not the first living things on Earth. Although higher plants have chlorophyll and can survive independently, their structure is complex, and it is not in line with the principles of evolution to call them the first living things. Most of the existing single-celled organisms, except for algae and the aforementioned few bacteria, live a parasitic or saprophytic life. These organisms are certainly not the first living things. Although algae have chlorophyll and can survive independently, their cells already have a clear nucleus, which is higher than bacteria, and cannot be the first living things. The aforementioned three bacteria, whose cells only have granular chromatin that has not yet formed a nuclear shape and has no traces of evolution, are perhaps the closest to being the first living things. The amount of sulfur and iron is not as large and widespread as nitrogen. There is so much free nitrogen in the air that in ancient times, sunlight could have synthesized nitrogen compounds at any time. When this nitrogen compound decomposes, it releases energy, which nitrifying bacteria can use. The fittest survive, so to trace back to the source, it is not too much to say that nitrifying bacteria are the predecessors of all living things.</p>

<p>— Ye Ren</p>
<p>One of the exhibits at the New York World's Fair</p>
<p>In the past decade, glass manufacturers in various countries have made significant progress in glass research. Today, glass is not only used for doors, windows, utensils, and optical instruments, but has also become an important building material for making walls, floors, tables, chairs, and even car frames. On the other hand, glass is also made into textile raw materials for the same purpose as cotton, silk, and hemp. The New York World's Fair features a variety of exhibits on new advances in glass manufacturing, which have aroused great interest among the general public. The illustration shows a new type of British glass panel that can be bent, twisted, resistant to heat cracking, and unbreakable. It is strong and flexible, like a steel sheet. Although the panel in the picture is only three-eighths of an inch thick, it can support the weight of one person, which shows its strength and toughness.</p>
<h3 id="e115">A Cigarette <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>— Qiaoxia Ke</p>
<p>It is reported that the National Government has issued a general order to the people of the whole country to vigorously carry out the movement of thrift. Finally, it also ordered to abstain from all consumption, to drink less wine and smoke less cigarettes, etc. Thus, only one cigarette is allowed, in order to comply with the general order. Although the highest limit is one cigarette, it also represents a one-sided view of life. In this screw-shell-like arena, is there room for scientific maneuvering? Yes! Moreover, all the smoking comrades in the country can maneuver with me, using extremely small and simple procedures to train the steps of reasoning. Of course, if the performance is not good, the blame lies with me alone. Comrades, please try it;</p>
<p>First, light a cigarette and take a puff. We discover that the smoke exhaled from the mouth is grayish-white, and the smoke rising from the cigarette end is light blue with a few grayish-white wisps. What is the reason for the difference? We might as well answer that the inside of the mouth is moist, and the smoke mixed with moisture changes color. Then why is the smoke coming out of the cigarette end still grayish-white? The answer is that the cigarette end is moistened by saliva. Why is it still white smoke after cutting off the wet part? Someone thought for a while and said, the tobacco itself contains moisture. Another person protested and said, no, no, when the smoke passes through the cigarette paper, the temperature obviously drops somewhat, and a certain substance in the smoke condenses and appears grayish-white. Alright, to solve the problem, let's try another set.</p>
<p>Second, hold a dripping wet glass with your left hand, with the mouth of the glass facing down, and hold the cigarette with your right hand, aiming at the mouth of the glass, about five or six inches apart (do not get too close). We see light smoke curling straight up, a portion of it penetrating into the glass. If the smoke from the cigarette turns white due to moisture or condenses due to cold, logically the smoke inside the glass should turn white, but the smoke inside the glass does not turn white, and the smoke coming out of the glass is still light blue. From this, it can be seen that although what the two gentlemen said is reasonable, it is still not the main reason for the white smoke. We need to try another set.</p>
<p>Third, in the same arrangement as before, we bring the cigarette closer to the mouth of the glass, or slightly inside the glass. The result is white smoke pervading, just like the smoke exhaled from the mouth. If the observation time is longer, the cigarette gradually goes out.</p>
<p>Try to explain: the change in the distance between the cigarette and the mouth of the glass can affect the color of the smoke, and the difference between inside and outside the glass lies in the size of the airflow range. Therefore, where air can flow easily, the air is easily replenished, and it burns more easily; where air cannot flow easily, the air is not easily replenished, and it does not burn easily; therefore, we might as well assume that white smoke is formed by relatively unburned substances. This substance shrouds the cigarette end, and the cigarette goes out. However, someone questioned: we don't smoke in a glass, but in the open air of nature, why is there also white smoke? This question not only fails to overturn our hypothesis, but also confirms the existence of another fact. Originally, even in a place where the air is circulating, using ordinary methods of combustion, unburned substances are always produced, and the larger the combustion range, the more such substances are produced. Therefore, when smoking a cigarette, bursts of white smoke appear like fog, and when you stop smoking, the white smoke gradually decreases. Think about when lighting a stove, you must first burn paper, can it immediately turn into nothing? No. Does white smoke come out? Yes.</p>
<p>Smoking comrades might as well continue to try, of course, the word "one" is about to be shaken. However, if there is a new hypothesis that scolds my idea as worthless, this is scientific progress, which is great. As for asking what is the difference in composition between light blue smoke and white smoke, and how much the difference is in specific gravity or the size of the smoke particles, this requires the researchers in the research institute to be busy, which cannot be solved by holding a glass in the left hand and a cigarette in the right hand.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Shanghai Rent Situation <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the rent for foreign-style houses in the Shanghai concession has fallen sharply, while the rent for Chinese-style houses has not changed much. Therefore, landowners find it profitable to build Chinese-style houses, or to replace dilapidated Western-style houses with Chinese-style ones. It is now heard that a Chinese person has spent 50,000 taels of silver to buy the old site of the Longsheng Foreign Firm opposite the China Merchants Bureau. They intend to demolish the current Western-style houses and replace them with Chinese-style ones. It can be seen that Western merchants' businesses have not been doing well in recent years, so they cannot afford the high rents of the past. Since Western-style houses occupy a lot of space, replacing them with Chinese-style houses to make a profit is understandable.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a Westerner suddenly came to the Shanghai City God Temple. He walked slowly in from the east gate and bought incense, candles, paper ingots, etc. under the left corridor. He paid one silver dollar for four items and then went to the main hall to perform the kneeling ceremony. Those watching from the side saw that his demeanor was solemn and respectful, so they praised him in amazement! It is said that this Westerner is acquainted with a Cantonese woman and feels quite fond of her. This incense offering was actually instructed by the Cantonese woman. Alas! It can be said that he is truly following the example of the Yan family.</p>

<p>The directors of the Municipal Council met yesterday to discuss an important matter: proposing to build a vegetable market on the vacant land opposite the Municipal Council, surrounded by stone pillars and covered with iron sheets, so that those who carry and sell vegetables every day can use it as a market. This method is common in Western countries, and its implementation in Shanghai would be beneficial to both buyers and sellers. On the one hand, there would be no fear of rain, and fresh produce would not spoil; on the other hand, there would be no suffering from wind and snow, and hawkers would not have to cry out from the cold. Moreover, they would have a fixed place to return to, and after the market closes each day, they could have a few moments to slowly tidy up their baskets, instead of having to finish by 9:00 AM.</p>

<h3 id="e119">The "Surrender Method" in the Literary World <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Hou</p>
<p>There are indeed some overly refined and overly enthusiastic people in the literary world. The former are good at frowning, and the latter are good at shouting. They are always dissatisfied with the current situation in the literary world and are always complaining from the sidelines.</p>
<p>Those overly refined people, upon seeing two articles arguing with each other, will sigh and say "This is individualism!", "This will darken the literary world!", and immediately become uneasy. Their meaning is: since it is the literary world, it must be "literary."</p>
<p>However, the reality is completely opposite to what those refined people think. The literary world certainly needs to be "literary," but if there were no arguments, there would be no literary world. Because even "praising" requires finding materials to accompany the "praise," which means there must be criticism; but once there is criticism, it is difficult to avoid "retaliatory" articles, and in the end, it is impossible to avoid "arguing." Moreover, arguing is only a temporary phenomenon. Over time, one side will inevitably be unable to argue further, and one side will achieve victory. People generally only see the peace and quiet after the victor becomes powerful and forget that if there were peace from the beginning, there would be no victory. Now "vernacular" has become a common tool, but its success relied on the arguments between the "New Youth" faction and the old faction. At that time, the fighters who stood on the side of the "New Youth" faction were not really for personal gain, and the result, which we now fully understand, did not really darken the literary world—although at that time it could not yet be called the literary world.</p>
<p>Also, those overly enthusiastic people, upon seeing a new trend emerging, always vent their anger on the new works. Thus, they shout, "Bring out real things!", "Such works are so disappointing!", truly crying and wailing, as if because the works are not good, the new trend has no meaning.</p>
<p>In fact, historically, whenever a new trend first appears, the works cannot be immediately mature. The reason is very simple: first, since it is a new trend, the works that follow that trend naturally have very few old heritage to rely on, and it will take some time for them to mature. Second, the new trend will inevitably involve changes in tools, and new tools cannot be used well in a morning or an evening. It still takes some time to mature. People generally see how brilliant famous works are, but forget that they also had ancestors who were not so brilliant. The example is still the situation during the "vernacular" movement: enthusiastic people also became anxious for a while, saying that there was not a single decent work. - Naturally, that was indeed the fact at the time. However, when the "vernacular" movement succeeded, those indecent works quickly disappeared, and the position was replaced by decent works. Even now, although we often hate ourselves for "not producing great works," there are always some works that cannot be considered bad. No one dares to say again that new literary writers cannot produce real things, and no one dares to shout out their disappointment without thinking.</p>
<p>In the end, overly refined people and overly enthusiastic people are both characters who support the old forces in the literary world. Their frowning and their shouting are just "surrender methods" adopted against the new forces.</p>
<p>But if we ask: in times of great turmoil, will these overly refined people and overly enthusiastic people still show their faces? The answer is: they will show their faces. But they will become characters who support the enemies of the entire nation. The method is still frowning and shouting, but it is to disarm the writers who are protecting the nation. There are such examples at present. Those who dislike others pointing out leftist tendencies and restoration tendencies are the former; those who stubbornly insist that war resistance literature is "war resistance stereotyped writing" are the latter.</p>

<p>— Mao Dun</p>
<p>(Above omitted) I remember that when I was in Lanzhou, I entrusted a friend in Hong Kong to forward a letter. I hope you received it soon. I flew from Lanzhou to Hami on February 20th, and on March 8th, I took a car from Hami through Shanshan, Turpan, and arrived in Dihua. It has been more than a month and a half now. I apologize for not writing earlier due to the complexity of various matters. This time, I decided to travel ten thousand miles, passing through Kunming, Chengdu, Xi'an, and Lanzhou. I stayed in Kunming for more than ten days and in Lanzhou for forty-five days. I have never been to the Northwest before. This time, I have fully appreciated the scenery outside the Great Wall. I took a car from Hami to Dihua, crossing the desert, and saw a large caravan of hundreds of camels winding back and forth. It can be said to be spectacular. What is worth recording is that since departing from Hong Kong, I have used almost all modern means of transportation by land, sea, and air. From Hong Kong to Haiphong, I took a boat. From Haiphong to Kunming, I took the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, passing over mountains and through more than 150 tunnels. From Kunming to Hami, I took a plane. From Hami to here, I took a car. And in Lanzhou, I also sat on a sheepskin raft to cross the Yellow River and walked on ice to cross the Yellow River (both outside the Lanzhou city walls). It can be said that I have tried everything. I have recorded everything along the way, but I have not yet had time to organize it. There are many new things to record here, but I have not been able to write them down due to the complexity of matters. I may be able to do it during the summer vacation. I am still planning to use the vacation to travel to other areas, such as Yili and Tacheng in northern Xinjiang. Perhaps there will be an opportunity to go there first. (Below omitted) April 30th</p>
<h3 id="e121">Joy (Two) <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Joy has truth, falsehood, greatness, and smallness. It can also be said that it has depth and shallowness. For example, two people meet and laugh and joke, their mouths full of joy, but the muscles on their faces carry a miserable and bitter expression. This kind of joy is false and shallow, and everyone knows it. Then, how much more true and how much deeper is the so-called joy of the lower-class entertainment that is popular in society than laughing and joking? Therefore, this kind of joy can encompass the joy gained by the general people who enjoy material pleasures in the world. There may be differences in degree among them, but in short, they are all false and shallow, small joys, not worth mentioning. We speak of joy that is true and great.</p>
<p>Confucius: eating coarse rice and drinking water, sleeping with one's arm as a pillow, is joy; Yan Hui: being content with a bamboo bowl of rice and a gourd of water in a humble alley is joy, which can be considered the truth of joy; Fan Zhongyan: being the last to enjoy the world and enjoying the world's joy, taking the world's joy as one's own joy, can be considered the greatness of joy. But this is quite difficult to say. Cheng Yi of the Song Dynasty taught people to seek the joy of Confucius and Yan Hui. It can be seen that the joy of Confucius and Yan Hui is quite difficult to obtain, day after day. Although Cheng Yi taught people like this, there are still few people who have achieved it to this day. As for the joy of Fan Zhongyan, it is the ambition of a great statesman, and ordinary people are not qualified to speak of it. Although this kind of joy is said to be true and great, it is inevitably empty talk and of no help. We talk about practical joy.</p>
<p>Practical joy is not the joy of emotion, not the joy of knowledge, and even less the joy of accidental misfortune, but the joy in the army of nature. It is not the joy of striving to seek, not the joy of accidental encounter, but the joy given by the true God. Then, how do we get this kind of joy? Listen to the next question.

<h3 id="e122">Sea <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>The sea is incomparably vast, extending to the far, far distance, intertwined with the sky to form a vast blue brocade, adorned in the universe, from the ancient times to the present. A literary giant's words describing the sea - the sea is smiling - has aroused the beautiful reveries of many people. Passionate young people dream of turquoise soft waves.</p>
<p>I lived for two summers in a seaside city. It was a port on the Bohai Bay, the throat of Guandong. The sweat of the people on the grasslands supported its prosperity. Every street, every building, was intertwined with the blood of slaves, with a pungent fishy smell. But, it strangled the lives of the exploited. The winding railway was a man-eating poisonous snake, spitting out its venomous tongue along the way, licking and retracting.</p>
<p>At this time, my days were quite absurd, and I spent them dreaming and looking at the sea. However, in the lonely days, there were some touching reveries, expecting a white sail all day long, what stories the sailor brought. I admired the life of the sailor, which was also a powerful hint for the role of life.</p>
<p>Whether it is day or night, it always drifts in the sea. A tenacious soul, a tough body, forever joking with one's own life. (A joke that is neither too big nor too small.) Avoiding reefs and icebergs, overcoming storms and waves, finally returning safely. Soon, it drifted away again. Fighting, incessantly fighting; tension, always tension.</p>
<p>One day, I left the ocean and came to the mainland. The turbid river water, even more turbid small rivers, often made me remember the blue sea. Sea, are you well?</p>
<p>Pirates have invaded. The sea began to roar, like an angry beast. That day, will that coastal city also roar? Sailing across the sea, the clear wind and white clouds should bring a message? But, I have heard too many stories of brave fishermen. (They make me excited and encourage me even more.)</p>
<p>The sea is no longer peaceful. Listen, its indignant narration. How many grievances are buried at the bottom of the sea? However, that will also be the tomb of the pirates!</p>
<p>Is it not right to help someone drowning by reaching out one's hand?</p>

<p>— Written by Gorky, translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>They hardly said anything. Whenever Vasika wanted water or something, she would go get it, and when she got in front of him, she would look at his face and sigh, and then she would go back to the window to sit. This went on for about four days. The madam was busy arranging for Vasika to enter the hospital, but at that time, there happened to be no empty room in the hospital. One evening, Vasika's room was already shrouded in twilight, when he raised his head and asked:</p>
<p>"Ajiusniya, what are you doing there?"</p>
<p>She was asleep, but his shout woke her up.</p>
<p>"Uh, there?" she replied.</p>
<p>"Won't you come over here?..."</p>
<p>She walked over and stood by his bed. Her hair was tied up on her head as usual, and she was fiddling with the ends of her hair with one hand.</p>
<p>"Do you need anything?"</p>
<p>"Bring a stool and sit here..."</p>
<p>She sighed, moved the stool from the window, and sat down by the bed.</p>
<p>"Is there anything else?"</p>
<p>"Nothing else: just please sit here with me..."</p>
<p>Vasika's big silver watch, hanging on the wall by his bed, was ticking quickly. Carriages rushing through the streets, with the rattling sound coming from the sleds, reached the room. The girls downstairs were laughing, and someone was singing loudly.</p>
<p>"Thinking of 'that poor student'!...</p>
<p>"Ajiusniya!" Vasika said.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Will you...be with me!...What do you hope for!"</p>
<p>"Aren't I with you?" she asked melancholically.</p>
<p>"No, listen more carefully...Needless to say, you can always agree..."</p>
<p>"I agree, of course..." she agreed.</p>
<p>He was silent and lay with his eyes closed for a while.</p>

<h3 id="e124">This Year's Watermelons <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Good harvest. Watermelon boats fill the Old Gate Bridge. Heavy taxes. Market prices are no lower than in previous years.</p>
<p>Summer is a season of fruits, and in hot weather, especially watermelons, are the most active in the local goods market. Although cold drinks are popular in every corner of the city, the honey-sweet watermelon is ultimately more refreshing than man-made cold drinks, so every summer, the watermelon market in Shanghai still maintains considerable excitement.</p>
<p>Originally, in Shanghai, due to traditional relations, there were four watermelon markets: Shiliupu, Baidu Bridge, Old Gate Bridge, and New Gate Bridge. The current situation is quite different. Due to special circumstances, the watermelon market at Baidu Bridge is quite bleak and can be considered non-existent. New Gate Bridge and Zhabei face each other across the river. After the "August 13th" incident, the bridge surface was closed for a considerable period of time, so the local goods stores south of the bridge closed their doors in the poor environment. Since last year, there has been no watermelon market. The former local goods stores have now become warehouses. Therefore, the more lively watermelon markets are only Shiliupu on the Bund of the French Concession and the Old Gate Bridge. In order to see the truth about the watermelon market after the watermelons were launched on the market following the Minor Heat solar term, I made a special trip to the Old Gate Bridge one summer morning. As a result, I brought back the following news:</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the Old Gate Bridge is a vegetable market. Unless it rains, it is always lively all year round. And in this hot weather, the excitement of the watermelon market is something that people who have not seen it will not know. From the corner of Fujian Road and Beijing Road to the corner of the Old Gate Bridge and Suzhou Road, nineteen out of ten cloth shops are opened as local goods stores. Each store has a signboard hanging horizontally at the door, and the store is filled with watermelons, winter melons, and large bunches of bananas hanging upside down. Therefore, these local goods stores have become a world of melons and fruits these days, and especially watermelons, piled up like mountains, account for an important part of the business.</p>
<p>Not only inside the local goods stores, but also on the stone steps of the sidewalk, there are large baskets of watermelons everywhere. Each stall has a burly man sitting on it, either bare-chested or wearing a Xiangyunsha shirt and pants, fanning himself with a cattail fan, with a large scale inserted beside him. The middle of the sidewalk is also full of winter melons and watermelons, and there are so many people that the sidewalk is difficult to walk on. Needless to say, cars are blocked.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, watermelon vendors also gathered at the Old Gate Bridge. They looked at the watermelons in the large baskets and talked about the price with the burly men next to the watermelon stalls. Perhaps the farmers who grew the watermelons were also nearby. After the intermediary shouted and bargained, the two sides came to an agreement and the deal was concluded. The watermelon vendors bought the watermelons and hurriedly carried them back, or hired a cart to push them back, either to set up their own stalls or to sell them in every small alley. Therefore, these days, every morning, the Old Gate Bridge area is full of people who grow and sell watermelons. There are also more refined families who go to the Old Gate Bridge to buy watermelons themselves. Good eyesight and fierce eyes naturally make it cheaper and more cost-effective than buying from a watermelon vendor.</p>
<p>In the crowd, there were also a few inconsiderate trucks making a lot of noise. I finally managed to walk to the Old Gate Bridge. The corner of the Suzhou Road section south of the bridge was also full of local goods stores. The Suzhou River was full of small steamboats and wooden-hulled boats. What especially caught your attention was the watermelon boats, filled with black-skinned or red-skinned watermelons. People on several boats were throwing the watermelons one by one onto the shore, and people on the shore caught them with their hands without dropping them, having developed a skill of their own.</p>
<p>These watermelon boats are supported by farmers who grow watermelons in the countryside. Most of the watermelons in Shanghai are transported from Pinghu, Liantang, Jintan, and the Su-Chang area. Last year, due to excessive rain, the watermelon harvest was too bad. In addition, the garrison of a certain party took whatever they saw to devour, and the puppet organizations in various places levied heavy taxes. Therefore, the people who grew watermelons lost money, and watermelons were almost extinct in the Shanghai market, costing more than ten yuan per load. This year, there is less rain, the watermelons are not only sweet, but also have a good harvest. Therefore, more watermelons are transported to Shanghai, and in theory, it can be the same as before the war, only selling two or three yuan per load, but due to the heavy taxes along the way, it still costs five or six yuan per load.</p>
<p>The people who grow watermelons naturally want to make money, the puppet organizations along the way have to extract one or two yuan of taxes per load, and when they arrive in Shanghai, the local goods store owners weigh the watermelons and shout the price, extracting a commission of one-tenth. After passing through the hands of the watermelon vendors, they will of course make money. Well! There are enough people exploiting the people who eat watermelons in Shanghai. If you buy directly from the farmers locally, it probably costs less than two yuan per load, but in Shanghai, it costs five or six yuan. Originally, under such circumstances where rice is like pearls and firewood is like cinnamon, most residents of "Watermelon Island" cannot even afford to eat, so where can they have extra money to buy watermelons to quench their thirst? It is just that on the other hand, there are naturally some wealthy families who, in addition to soda and fresh orange juice, also buy several loads of watermelons. Therefore, although two watermelon markets have been reduced, the watermelon market at the Old Gate Bridge still maintains the excitement of the pre-war period.</p>
<h3 id="e125">New Business: Household Services <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>— Dehui</p>
<p>Recently, the financial sector has launched a new business of "household services." The purpose of their "household services" is that they feel that a family, regardless of the number of people and the simplicity or complexity of affairs, its daily living expenses are mostly managed by the housewife or someone she sends because the man is busy serving in society and cannot take care of household affairs. However, this kind of management by sending someone or doing it personally is both time-consuming and expensive, and carrying money back and forth is prone to various accidents such as theft and robbery if one is not careful. Because of this, this "household service" was created. The purpose is to seek convenience for families, reduce the extra consumption of housewives, and increase their own profits.</p>
<p>The procedure for entrusting this "household service" is as follows: beforehand, you must deposit more than 50 national currency units into an account, or deposit the estimated amount to be paid each month in advance. The depositary bank will issue a receipt and a withdrawal slip, and the depositor must keep a seal. In this way, when you want to manage the funds, you can send the bill to be paid, open the withdrawal slip issued to you, and send it to the bank, and they will immediately pay it for you separately. The receipts and return slips that are retrieved will be sent together when the monthly statement is issued. If you entrust them to collect money, you must also send them the receipt issued by the bank, and after receiving it, they will record it in your account book and notify you immediately.</p>
<p>There is also interest to be calculated on the receipts and payments of this "household service," and the interest rate is six percent, which is settled on June 20th and December 20th each. In addition to entrusting receipts and payments, there is also a consumer cooperative organization. Those who join the "household service" can entrust them to handle daily necessities such as rice, coal, firewood, etc. When you need to use them, you can order them to be delivered, but you must deposit a considerable amount of money in advance. In addition, there are also personnel consultations to answer all personnel matters for you.</p>
<p>"Household services" are indeed very in line with the needs of families in today's world, but because they are still emerging, they still need to be developed in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Rain After the Storm <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Thousands of Families Collaborate in Rural Fireworks, Waves Fly Across Myriad Miles of the Eastern Sea</p>
<p>These cooperative shops are extremely trivial in their operations, yet they possess a definite method of management. If managed properly, there is nothing difficult about them. Zhu Aili initially treated it as a game, starting with three hundred yuan to try it out. Unexpectedly, it has been thriving recently, and he feels interested in it. This is because the number of villagers in Freedom Village is increasing day by day. As the number of villagers increases, their daily necessities naturally increase as well. Some obtain goods from the cooperative shop, and others also obtain goods from the cooperative shop. It is cheap and saves trouble, so why not do it? Because cooperative ventures have cooperative associations, and recently the Chinese cooperative business has greatly developed. Regarding consumer cooperatives, many factories directly trade with cooperative shops, and contracts are signed, no longer going through the hands of middlemen. Others involve cooperative societies exchanging goods with each other. Some are divided into many cooperative branches from a cooperative headquarters, so that they are dispersed into civil society. Some are wholesale cooperative societies that distribute various items to retail cooperative shops. In short, regarding cooperation, the forms and colors vary, each being different. But ultimately, the point is that sellers and buyers benefit from mutual assistance, without letting middlemen exploit the profits. Since the prevalence of cooperative ventures, a group of people who used to engage in speculative commerce have no way to speculate anymore. Fortunately, the state has controlled some of the people's consumption. The first is grain, and the second is fuel. For example, there is a statistic of how much rice a place needs to eat each year. Grain is proportional to the population. If there are 100,000 people in this place, grain for 100,000 people will certainly be prepared early. How much grain can be produced locally? Is the grain produced locally sufficient for local needs? If the grain produced locally is not sufficient for local needs, it must be transported from other places. If there is a surplus of grain produced locally, it can also be transported to other places. Just like Freedom Village, where there are many rice fields. In the past, six tenths of the rice produced in the village was used for the village's own use, and four tenths could be exported. Now that the population of Freedom Village has increased, it seems that six tenths of the rice produced in the village is not enough for the village. However, only five tenths is actually enough, and the remaining five tenths can be exported. What is the reason for this? It turns out that although the population of Freedom Village has increased, there has been progress in agriculture. In the past, one mu of land could produce a certain number of shi of rice, but now it can be doubled. In the past, it was one harvest a year, but now it can be two harvests a year. Calculated in this way, isn't five tenths enough? Moreover, these five tenths even include the rice stored in the annual storage warehouses. (160)</p>
<h3 id="e127">Matchbox-Packing Girls <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>— (Hua)</p>
<p>Heavy Work · Fourteen Hours a Day Low Wages · A Little Over One Cent for One Hundred and Twenty Boxes</p>
<p>In order to maintain a minimum standard of living, when the sky faintly reveals a bit of dawn, the roads in the factory area of ​​Shanghai West are already filled with many malnourished people. Each face has a pair of eyes filled with red veins due to lack of sleep, dragging heavy steps, heading to their respective workplaces.</p>
<p>In addition to the large number of yarn, cloth, weaving, silk reeling, and machinery factories, there are two match factories in Shanghai West. Although matches are indispensable necessities for people, match workers are unwilling to mention or see matches like enemies. However, in order to survive, they cannot escape the scope of the match factory.</p>
<p>In order to increase production, the factory makes the workers work fourteen hours a day. In the stuffy houses like pigeon cages, every night that is infested by mosquitoes and bedbugs has not completely passed, and they have to put their bodies, which have not recovered their strength, into intense work. Will this not affect work efficiency? However, the factory is smarter. It pays wages based on piecework. The wages are so low, and the match industry workers, who cannot recruit night shift workers in reality, are eking out a living in this situation.</p>
<p>Matchbox-packing girls can only get a little over one cent for packing one hundred and twenty small boxes of matches. If their skills are not yet proficient, it is common to see a daily wage of around one dime on the pay slip. Old workers who have worked in the match factory for ten years can earn at most fifty cents a day. After food and housing, will there be any surplus from these wages?</p>
<p>In addition to heavy work and low wages, match factories are more dangerous places than other factories, because match raw materials are not only flammable but also highly explosive; the lives of workers are in extreme danger. The workers all hope that the factory can increase wages, shorten working hours, and more importantly, take out group life insurance.</p>
<p>"During times of national crisis, the workers are enduring all suffering more calmly than before. As long as the capitalists do not oppress us excessively, we will never be used by others to start unnecessary struggles. At the same time, we hope that the capitalists can understand our sincerity and improve our treatment." The above is what the match factory workers said to me at last.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Polish Female Star Refuses to Be Hitler's Lover <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Demands Compensation for Damage to Reputation</p>
<p>The German leader Hitler's great love for female movie stars has become an unbreakable legend in Europe and the United States. The famous Paris film magazine "Silver Coffee" recently published a feature article entitled "The Enchantress of the Third Germany," which listed three of Hitler's mistresses: one is the Jewish female star Leni Riefenstahl, one is Princess Schillingfurst, and the other is the new Polish national female star Pola Negri, famous for her "black eyes," who came to Paris from Moravia. It claims that their latent power is enough to control Hitler.</p>
<p>Of these, the former two have not responded to this. However, the third person, Negri, was very angry after hearing the news, believing that it was completely untrue and that she was not Hitler's lover. She specifically entrusted a lawyer to file a complaint with the Paris 12th District Disciplinary Court, demanding that the magazine pay one million francs in "damage to her reputation." Her reason is: "I do not hate anyone in the world, but Hitler is certainly not among my best friends."</p>
<p>This rather scandalous drama has attracted many visitors to come one after another. Negri says to anyone she meets: "You think, I would have the power to control Hitler! These ridiculous words only make me spend legal fees. Although I have no enemies, I have my position. The magazine has damaged my reputation. It must be compensated!"</p>
<p>It is not known how this lawsuit will end. But as far as the protagonist of this case is concerned, she is originally a famous patriotic star in Poland, who has made many national resistance films for the Polish government. In this critical autumn of German-Polish situation, Negri will certainly not fall into Hitler's trap. She came to Paris to prepare to star in a great film, and then return to her country to serve. She has no plans to go to Hollywood. Because the Hollywood film industry has already made a decision: "Anyone who is related to dictators, whether true or false, will be rejected with a closed door." Leni Riefenstahl already had a lesson from the past last autumn, which proves this.</p>

<p>Yu Yuqin, the only remaining veteran opera performer, was a famous talent in the Peking opera world during the Guangxu and Xuantong periods. She was seventy-one years old this year. She usually did not take good care of herself, but her physique was stronger than usual. In recent years, due to her deteriorating situation, she looked slightly haggard. However, the septuagenarian still wanted to teach students to support herself. Her plight was well known to her colleagues. A month ago, she occasionally caught a minor illness, but she did not care about it at first. Later, it turned critical, and she finally died of illness at her residence in Beijing at 5 pm on the 8th of this month. When the news came, everyone who heard it expressed their grief and regret.</p>
<p>Talents in Peking opera martial female roles have always been few and far between. Only Yu Yuqin and Zhu Wenying have been able to establish their own school and become a generation of typical figures worshipped by later generations. Zhu is known for her thrilling moves. Those who follow her school, such as Jiu Zhenfeng Zhu Guifang, and in recent times Yan Shishan, Zhu Shengfu, and Song Dezhu, all have a consistent style. Yu is famous for her agility and liveliness, blending female and warrior roles into one. Therefore, the performance has the meaning of warrior and female roles. There is only one person who can inherit her mantle, and that is practically unique. To lower the standards, the only one who is barely satisfactory is Rong Diexian. Yu Yuqin was from Qianshan, Anhui, with the childhood name Zhuang'er. She was good at both warrior and female warrior roles, and also good at female roles. She was graceful and slim, resembling a beautiful woman from Yan and Zhao. She first performed in the old Dan Gui Teahouse in Shanghai, singing opening operas, without much fame. Later, she went to Suzhou and Hangzhou, and then traveled all over the Yangtze River region. She entered Beijing in the twelfth year of Guangxu and belonged to the Si Xi Troupe. She was most welcomed by the Peking opera connoisseurs in Beijing for performing "The Story of Heroes and Heroines," "Drunkenness," "Enchanting Hall," "Qingshi Mountain," "Rainbow Pass," "Ten Golden Pills," "Playing with Fire Sticks," "Great Performing Arts," "Outlaws of the Marsh," "Complete Biography of Political Morality," "Sizhou City," "Iron Bow Marriage," and "Baicao Mountain," "Pearl Shirt" and other dramas. In addition to performing arts, she was also good at operating opera houses and founding opera schools. In the fifteenth year of Guangxu, she founded the Fushou Troupe, and in the nineteenth year, she founded the Xiao Fushou Opera School. In the twenty-third year, she built Guangxing Garden outside Chongwenmen Tea Food Hutong. Therefore, for a time, the name of Yu Zhuang'er was known to everyone. Later, she was a court performer and was deeply loved by Emperor Guangxu. In Zhang Xiaocang's book "Notes on the Peking Opera World," there is an anecdote in the chapter on Yu Yuqin's skills:</p>
<p>Emperor Dezong of Qing showed his greatest appreciation for Yuqin. Yuqin was performing "Nenren Temple." As soon as she came off stage, before she had removed her makeup, Emperor Dezong suddenly summoned her into the palace. He took Yuqin's hand and looked back and said, "Zhuang'er is so lovely." The Empress feared that she would complain to the Empress Dowager, and Emperor Dezong was afraid. He saw that the knife that Yuqin was wearing was not a fake object, and he would punish her for carrying a weapon in front of the emperor. He waved her out and said, "Send her to the Ministry of Justice." Yu Qin then reported that she was violently ill, so the singing girls disappeared for nearly twenty years. It was not until the Xuantong period that she dared to associate with people again.</p>
<p>In the third year of Xuantong, Yuqin founded Danggui Garden in Dong'an Market. It was destroyed by fire in the first year of the Republic of China due to the mutiny. Although funds were raised to rebuild it later, her vitality was not restored, and her debts increased day by day. From then on, she fell into despair. After the tenth year of the Republic of China, her family property was lost, and her situation became worse. She relied on the assistance of her colleagues and teaching students to make a living. Such a decline of a generation of artists is indeed very pitiful. There are three points that Yuqin's art can pass on: (1) Her posture is light and soft as if boneless, but her demeanor is heroic and does not lose the identity of a female general. Her style is based on martial female roles and supplemented by female roles, combining strength and softness, unique in ancient and modern times. (2) Her martial arts skills are pure, skillful, and stable, without showing off or pandering to the crowd. Zhu Wenying cannot match her in her tumbling skills. (3) Her face has drama, and her eyes are especially good. She conveys the spirit vividly, changing in an instant. This benefits from her attainments in female roles, which is extremely difficult for later scholars to comprehend.</p>
<p>Yuqin's father's name was Dahai. He was a scholar in the town with a good reputation. He was not tolerated by his stepmother and fled to Shanghai. Due to poverty, he made Zhuang'er learn opera. Yuqin was gentle and kind. Her mother died early, and she served her father with filial piety. When her father was occasionally ill, she always served him medicine, day and night without stopping. She loved to drink, but did not drink excessively. Her father forbade her because it would damage her singing voice, but she still secretly drank as before. Therefore, people said that Yuqin was famous for her filial piety, but she could not follow her father's words in a little way, which was also due to her nature. She had two sons, the eldest named Xiaoqin, who belonged to the Xiao Fushou Opera School and studied martial male roles, and the second named Youqin, who studied civil and martial old male roles. Both were unsuccessful and died before her.</p>

<h3 id="e130">Opera School and Cheng's Singing Style (Part 2) <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Leng Fang's Notes</p>
<p>...Oral Account by Miss Hou Yulan, "Female Yanqiu"...</p>
<p>I studied in the opera school for five years and felt that learning opera requires extreme endurance, which is really not an easy task. At the same time, I am very interested in the work of acting, and I think its influence is very great. Now, although I have learned quite a few female and colorful-shirt operas, and I have already graduated from the opera school, I am still far from my ideal in terms of art. Therefore, after returning to Beijing this time, I am determined to return to my alma mater to continue my studies. I don't want to join a troupe for the time being. Both myself and my family have this opinion. First, the environment in my alma mater is very good; second, I am still young, so I still have to work hard on the literary courses for a few years. At the very least, I want to allocate my time to "learning" more than "singing," and I don't want to professionalize my meager skills too much for the time being.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding my stage style, I am grateful for the many teachers and newspapers who have praised and encouraged me, saying that I learned from Mr. Cheng (Yanqiu) very well. I am really grateful and ashamed! Originally, I was a student of Mr. Wu Fuqin. Mr. Wu has been acting with Mr. Cheng for nearly twenty years, and he has a lot of research on Mr. Cheng's art. Therefore, in the basic technical learning, he mostly adopts Mr. Cheng's techniques and works hard according to the rules. Mr. Cheng himself has also told me about several operas, such as the gestures in "Flower Boat Romance," the running slope, round stage, and entering the kiln in "Wujia Slope," the water sleeves in "Golden Lock Record," and the whole body gestures and voice adjustments in "Zhen Qing Ji" when Mr. Cheng came during the rehearsal. Mr. Cheng also corrected all the words, sounds, and syllables in "Peacock Flies Southeast" when I was recording a record. In addition, in ordinary times, we would go to watch and learn from Mr. Cheng's Autumn Sound Society whenever they sang operas. Those who study old male roles pay attention to Mr. Wang Shaolou, those who study painted faces pay attention to Mr. Hou Xirui, and those who study clowns pay attention to Mr. Cao Ergeng. We who study female roles pay more attention to Mr. Cheng's singing, dialogue, and actions. In these various aspects, we have indeed gained a lot of benefits, but we dare not say that we have more insights. Mr. Cheng is a great artist, and his art is too profound. I am really ashamed. How can I often be said to be very similar to Mr. Cheng?</p>
<p>I am still a girl and understand very little. I hope that the gentlemen who love drama will not hesitate to give me more advice.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The long headdress used by female roles was created by Mei Qiaoling... However, according to what he said to people after the opera, he really didn't feel how bitter it was. This is exactly in line with the saying that "doing good is the greatest joy." It can be seen that as long as a person feels happy in spirit, all physical pain will naturally disappear into nothingness. Mr. Mei is at the age of retirement and seclusion. He could have declined all external disturbances and no longer show his appearance to people. However, he still voluntarily initiated charity relief performances, not only initiating them but also inventing this long headdress to reduce his old age. He is so kind and generous to others. No wonder his descendants can enjoy such a great reputation. Not to mention that Dr. Mei's name is known at home and abroad, Yutian's erhu is also one of the leading figures in the Chinese theater scene. Now, when female roles wear headdresses, they still often use that long, several-foot-long gauze headdress. Even children like Mao Shilai, who are only ten years old, have tender skin on their faces, but they all use this. If you want to ask them what the purpose is, they can still answer the reason, but I am afraid that very few people know the origin of this thing. Chinese people often have the problem of forgetting their ancestors. In the pear garden, they only value the teacher's inheritance and do not seek thorough understanding. In the backstage, everything is known as a matter of course, but they do not know the reason why. Therefore, I would like to contribute my humble opinion to fellow enthusiasts, hoping that the original intention of Mr. Mei's invention of this thing will not be obliterated, and that his grandson, Dr. Wanhua, should still inherit his great-grandfather's benevolent spirit and do more good for the national compatriots, gathering the names of all walks of life, from male, female, painted face, and clown, to initiate a large-scale charity performance, and with his high status, it should not be difficult to promote its success. I hope that Dr. Wanhua will pay attention to it. —(62)—</p>
<h3 id="e133">The Chinese Cultural Troupe That Traveled in the United States for Eight Months Dissolves Without a Trace <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Donation Results Have Not Been Announced</p>
<p>The Chinese Cultural Troupe organized by Tang Tan Aifu, Zhou Zhibin, and others went abroad to perform in the United States last August. Their purpose was to introduce Chinese culture and raise money for refugees. After eight months of roaming, they have now returned to Shanghai, and the troupe has also recently disbanded. Yesterday, the reporter met one of their members, who told me in detail everything that happened. I will briefly record it below.</p>
<p>According to him, after arriving in the United States, they performed in New York and San Francisco and were able to stand for eight months, all thanks to the help of the consulate and the overseas Chinese. They all miss and care about their motherland very much, so they warmly welcomed the troupe with the "Chinese Culture" label.</p>
<p>As for the performances, they included musical ensemble, jumping jiaoguan, Chang'e Flying to the Moon, jumping pan, casting the army, Guifei Drunk, Beihuzhou, Feihushan, etc. Chang'e Flying to the Moon is just a solo dance, and Guifei Drunk is a circus-style opera. Therefore, the overseas Chinese believe that it is doubtful whether these operas can represent Chinese culture.</p>
<p>One day, eleven members of the troupe were led by Consul Zhang Zichang to meet Princess Der Ling, which caused a great joke. Because the teacher of the troupe, Guan Hongshi, wore a blue robe and black mandarin jacket and actually bowed to Princess Der Ling with a "dǎ qiān" etiquette, which made all the members of the troupe embarrassed, and the faces of Princess Der Ling and Consul Zhang Zichang turned red. In addition, a female member of the troupe, surnamed Zhang, found a partner abroad and married, which is also a good story of this troupe.</p>
<p>Now that they have returned to China, with the members scattered, the troupe no longer exists. However, the fact that the results of the donations have not been announced is considered a regret.</p>

<p>Shirley Temple hopes to become a policewoman when she grows up. This news will make the New York City Detective Bureau give her an invitation letter, appointing her as an honorary member of the "New York Good People Association" and awarding her a gold medal.</p>
<p>Mickey Rooney does not want to end his life as an actor. He wants to go to a university to study for two years and then become a director. It is said that he has studied various directing methods and has talked with many artists such as Leon Barrymore and Louis Stone.</p>
<p>Judy Garland plans to take up another profession in the future besides acting. She once said: "I am now saving money to enter a law school. I think lawyers are the most humane people in the world. They can defend people from injustice and appeal for justice."</p>
