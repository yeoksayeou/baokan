<p>社評</p>
<h3>概論工潮</h3>
<p>近幾天，上海租界內勞資糾紛迭發。南京路幾家大公司的怠工風潮漸吿和平解決；而蘇州河北及其他各處工廠，又傳相繼發生罷工事件！其中且有不少爲英美商人所經營的企業。這顯然是最近日常生活物品激漲所引起的重大社會問題。上海自成爲孤島之後，就其本身言之，依然擁有中外居民號稱五百萬之多，確爲人羣密集的大都市；再就國際關係言之，上海在戰前爲歐美各國在華經濟活動的集中地，現在仍還保持着很重要的地位。在此百物騰貴，生活艱難的時期，我們當然異常同情於勞工；同時有鑒於往日綸昌工潮的公開秘密，不能不想像及於租界內勞資糾紛倘若不幸而範圍擴大，則其影響與意義，將不僅是一般的勞資糾紛與一般的勞工問題了。</p>
<p>最近勞資糾紛的產生，唯一原因在於勞工生活遭遇了嚴重的事實；這與幾年前一般僅僅因爲要求改進勞工條件而發生糾紛絕不相同。據各方消息，最近糾紛中之商行工廠職工對當局所提出的要求，大都祇限於生活津貼，和保障繼續工作兩點。這是事實：近幾個月來上海物價，除因國際大環境而昂貴之外，又因奸商的投機操縱，惡勢力的搗亂壟斷，推波助瀾，趁火打刼，以致日夜的不斷飛漲；而一般職工的薪資，却未能跟着比例的增加。一般勞工日常最低生活的難於維持，可想而知。例如人人必需的食米，就是吃客秈，每石限價卅八元，勞工每人每日至少以五合計算，便需米錢一角九分；五口之家，每日九角半；倘若月薪三十元，祇夠糶米；其他如油鹽柴炭以及房租，一無着落，而無一不是必需，又無一不是昂貴。因此之故，吾們以爲職工要求廠商當局增加生活津貼，確也是迫不得已；至於保證織續工作，一般的意義，在於預防當局的報復行動，或恐當局藉口緊縮而裁減人員；但目前還有其特別意義，蓋失業者不知凡幾，若使月獲三十元，雖吃不得飽，養不得家，而爲現任職工所不滿意，這在失業者却認爲聊勝於無，求之不得；失業者爭取機會，最容易引起商行工廠當局的毒念；故要求保證繼續工作，亦未可厚非。</p>
<p>以我們的觀感，每一個事業下的每一個工作人員，務須維持得本人及其家屬的生活，然後職工能保持其工作效率，事業能發揮其正常生機。數日來，南京路中區若干商店怠工事件的迅速和平解決，可以證明他們當局對於目前情况，具有準確的認識。不但是溫情，亦是需要；不但爲自己的事業，亦所以穩定社會的秩序，也就是愛護國家。因此之故，我們獲悉每一工潮的解決，必覺得異樣的安慰。幷且推類及於一般工商業經營者，凡是已發生類似糾紛的，務必盡情善意，考慮職工所提出的要求，竭力避免糾紛的擴大；就是現在尙未發生問題的，亦須詳細調査職工生活狀態，自動改善他們的待遇。因爲物價確是奇貴，生活確是萬難，必須爲職工設身處地而着想，必須爲社會國家而着想；這也不但是溫情，事實所示，大勢所趨，無可否認，無可抗違，這是應該的。</p>
<p>同時希望一般職工，也要顧念目前的環境，認淸自己的責任。目前上海租界中，儘有不少的工商事業，確是爲國家保持着一部份的經濟元氣；職工們也不要儘藉口於生活困難，而陷事業於不能担負維持的境地，這也容易造成爲親者所痛而爲仇者所快的事情。要知道此時此地的職工，不是談待遇怎樣改善的時候，此際必須節衣縮食，才對得起內地一般放棄了自己的職業，離開自己的家庭，而在風霜雨雪之下，忍苦耐勞從事救國工作的同胞。職工忠於自己的職業，和當局取得相當的諒解合作，直接固是維持了事業的生機，社會的安甯，間接就是穩定了國民經濟的基礎，减少了全國族在目前與將來的艱難。切戒乘此機會，肆意要挾。要知道經營事業的人，當然希望事業的保全；雖有八九分困難，祗要有一二分希望，便想姑且忍痛保全，萬一忍痛無效，終於同歸於盡；而肆意要挾，即使如願於一時，每每加速了毀滅！還要知道，形形色色的破壞主義者，蓄意破壞，借刀殺人；它們利用機會，播弄風潮，決不會明白吿訴你是它的刀；却還有堂皇冠冕的理論，驚心動魄的口號，使你被利用而自以爲是自動，使你永遠被犧牲而自以爲現實的便宜。以前上海的勞資糾紛，有專司仲裁的機關，現在時局不同，我們不能不希望租界當局及各公法團負担起調解的任務，務求公允的處置，和平的解決。當然調解是治標而非治本。要澈底解決目前爲生活問題而起的勞資糾紛，必須根本設法抑低高漲的物價。這不能不期望於租界當局爲更嚴厲更廣泛的有效處置。</p>
<h3>國聯會和平建議　蘇聯覆文拒絕　阿眞廷建議開除蘇聯會籍　由十四國委員會加以審奪</h3>
<p>莫斯科　蘇聯人民外交委員長莫洛托夫昨日接到國聯大會芬蘭問題委員會主席即葡萄牙代表達瑪泰來電一件、其文云、</p>
<p>「本委員會由按照盟的第十五條召集之國聯大會決議組織、茲緊急要求蘇聯政府及芬蘭政府停止敵對行爲、並立即在大會中開始和平談判、芬蘭現有代表出席、業已表示同意、貴政府是否接受上述請求、並立即停止敵對行爲、希於明日（星期二）即賜答復爲荷」</p>

<h3>美日商約難續訂　美朝野均主制日　日貨輸美將遭嚴重打擊　對日禁輸貨物案將通過　美名敎授在滬談片</h3>
<p>美國洛斯安傑爾斯城加里福尼亞大學政治科學敎授史汀納、乘假期西行、視察遠東、兩月間歷經日本·朝鮮·東北及華北、上周輪過滬埠、偶均小駐、大中社記者特訪謁於國際飯店、飽聆縱談太平洋上三角關係之現局、約半小時、</p>
<p>美日商約決難續訂</p>
<p>綜史汀納敎授之所觀察、則（一）美日兩國之間、殊無續訂新商約之可能、（二）美國參議員畢德曼所主張之對日禁輸貨物的立法、卽將在國會有所行動、而可在適然良好之時機中獲得通過、</p>
<p>斷然廢約旨在制日</p>
<p>史敎授告記者稱、華盛頓之所以決然通吿廢棄一九一一年美日商約、其主要目的、乃在使國務院可獲得處理對日問題之機動性、如其是項商約、將加續訂、或成立代用之新的、則美國豈非自毀其目的哉　是以美國之不欲與日訂約彰然明甚、</p>
<p>日貨輸美大授打擊</p>
<p>依史敎授之觀察美日之間、雖無商約存在、貿易行爲、仍將繼續、如其僅缺商約　並不致影響美貨之對日輸出、惟是日本從美日商約中所取得之最惠國利益、則經削除、因之日貨之輸入美國、勢當受嚴重之影響、蓋以日本喪失是項商的後、對美輸出、當繳納美國法律普通規定之稅率也、</p>
<p>美國民意傾向制裁</p>
<p>史敎授繼稱、美國民意　現均傾向於制裁日本此種占優勢之公意、行將於參議員畢德曼對日禁輸貨物案之重大討論中獲見效果、蓋以此係一種良好之境遇、使禁貨法案得在下屆國會中通過也、總而言之、美國人之深惡痛絕者、厥爲侵略者與戰爭之製造者、職是之故、彼等之準備採取行動、殆與日俱進也、</p>

<p>昨日下午、徐家匯各米店如永亨米號等、因日來民食恐慌、幾達極點、貧苦民衆、已難餬口、而該處一帶、平民甚衆、誠恐一時爲生活所迫、挺而走險、並風聞已有集結搶米企圖、爲預防起見、各該米號聞訊後、均紛紛將櫃台鐵欄干嚴加扃閉、購米者只准隔欄交易、不准進出、以防意外、</p>
<p>日方言行尙未一致</p>
<p>字林報云、兩租界聯合發表布吿後、官方希望米價不久即將感受影響而大减、西貢米五千石、可望於今日（十三日）裝輪運到、存入棧房、昨（十二日）聞上星期在中山路附近蘇州河中被日當局扣留之米糧六船、今已售予日商、另有載米船六艘、今被扣於曹家渡附近蘇州河中、每船載米的五千石、又聞米約一萬三千石、自內地運祖閘北麥根路口河中、迄今仍被扣留於該地、日陸軍發言人昨日宣稱、日陸軍所有之大量食米、刻正向上海運來、為華人民衆利益計、將廉價出售之、俾使米價低落</p>
<p>成交貢米大量運滬</p>
<p>本市各米業行號絡續委由法商達孚洋行·瑞商福家洋行·英商合義洋行·電洽成交西貢洋米、巳達三十二萬包、除巳先後裝輸運滬達三分之一外、昨日裝「琴來抱脫」馬勒輪抵埠貢米計一號米一千五百噸、即一萬五千包、碎米五百噸、即五千包、日內尙有一萬餘包、裝「蘇州」輪運抵、及一重慶輪一萬五千包、至於各地國米運滬雖受阻撓、但來源並未中斷、昨日車輪運滬約六千餘包、</p>
<p>交易慣例積習難返</p>
<p>霞飛路某米號主徐姓、以有囤積嫌疑、被法租界警務處傳往捕房質訊、事後、據正當米商稱我國交易向例、大都一言爲定、故雖有不得賣空買空及縮短交割期限之規定、但難於澈底辦到、因在雙方交易時旣無定單契的及釐定明文之手續、故在交割三天期滿後、或憑私人情感、再寬限三天、循此順延、仍與以前限期無異、至於囤戶之堆儲、無不千方佈置、情形複雜、如水陸兩路來滬之食糧、如船隻停靠在虹口一帶碼頭者、即將來貨堆在虹口各堆棧、並有一部份囤戶、深懼租界當局及平民之檢舉、特將米糧、堆儲於工部局勢力所不能及之特殊區域、當局將無法可以調查明白、而自滬戰後兩租界各私人之賃住宅爲堆棧者、比比皆是、惟今之計、祇有請求工部局從速製定表格、登報公吿、限令一般行商客戶、將存儲堆棧之米糧、一律登記、報吿、是則有待兩租界當局之更大努力也、</p>
<h3>日方操縱偽工會　强迫工人入會　迫使外商所僱工人入會　企圖控制一切發動擾亂</h3>
<p>大陸報云、所謂「中華工人福益會」威脅工人後、昨日（十二日）乃悉日方已發動一種企圖、擬將東區外商工商業所僱大批工人、置諸日陸軍之掌握中、該「福益會」之手段、於星期一日晨首次爲公衆所注意、緣該會糾察隊於是晨攔阻載有楊樹浦英商中國肥皂公司工人之</p>
<p>卡車一輛迫令駕駛人開車將工人載往仰光路一百二十七號該會總部、然後强迫工人加入該會、繳付入會費每人一元、及月費二角、是晨七時、中國肥皂公司工廠中之工人的七百名、乃無入廠工作者、聞該會幕後係</p>
<p>日人操縱非正式之首領、係一華人、但聽令於某韓人據未證實消息稱、彼等之上、尙有更高之首腦、乃曾在日陸軍中任大佐之某日人、一般人相信該會之存在、志在以種種方法、使東區</p>
<p>外商實業或其他大企業听雇工人、盡入該會爲會員、若輩一旦控制工人、即能令工人虛構任何不滿、而宣布罷工、據消息靈通方面聲稱、該會之目的、似在無端發動擾亂、如中國肥皂公司工廠之罷工、以及華鋁鋼精廠·博德連製造廠·中國紙版製品公司·與怡和冷氣堆棧·等工人之擾動、均係所謂「中華工人福益會」所煽動、聞</p>
<p>新近解決之德商魯麟洋行·瑞鎔船廠·怡和紗廠·與平和洋行之罷工、亦係該會所組織、據查悉、此日方卵翼下「福益會」之陰謀，非專謀反對任何一國之外商、但大多係對英商而發、其故乃因束區工廠多屬英商、而非是項運動有反英性質、蓋美·德與瑞士商之工廠、亦受其影響者也、</p>
<h3>操縱壟斷投機日用品　法律制裁之意見　蔣澧泉推束函</h3>

<p>依照條例第一條、對於食糧及油·鹽·糧·煤·焦炭·棉·絲·麻·羊毛·及其製造品等、可由經濟部呈經行政院核准管理、管理之方法、可依照經濟部頒布之非常時期評定物價及取締投機操縱辦法（以下簡稱辦法）第二條、由地方行政當局會同有關機關商會或該業同業公會組織平價委員會、先由行政當局令各商號將其存貨成本具報（辦法第九條）、由會評定售價、及利潤、電陳經濟部核准、作爲指定之乎價、如租界當局對于地方官署字樣、有所異議、不妨參酌變通、唯必須有租界當局參加、始有力量、現時滬上聞亦有評價委員會之組織、惟須照部頒辦法、加以充實耳、</p>

<h3>運費增高　煤價又將上漲　目下滬市存煤並不缺乏　運煤船隻因歐戰被徴調</h3>
<p>大陸報云、頃據大煤商表示意見稱、本市硬煤與烟煤之價格、不久將大漲、此種局面、大半因運費增高、而非目下存煤缺乏所致、今上海購硬煤以每噸一百零八元之價格爲最廉、預料即將漲至一百二十六元左右、實則目前巳有若干煤商以每噸約一百二十六元之價格出售矣、華北烟煤、今售每噸四十元、較上月漲六元、印度烟煤在本市則售每噸一百十二元、多數煤商均舉</p>
<p>運貨增高爲煤價騰貴之理由、另一原因則爲法幣價値低落、煤斤自印度運來其運費在八月間爲每噸二十元左右、今巳增至三十二元、據華北某公司昨稱、該公司能保持最低之煤價、因歐戰爆發時、該公司之運煤船乃以租賃爲基礎也、但其中三艘、上月被召返在</p>
<p>戰事服役而所租接替船雙、其租費已高漲、凡歐戰前所和船隻、長此不脫手、則該公司能以每噸售價四十元之烟煤供給上海、如新租船隻、以資接替、則價格自將高漲、本市煤斤與煤球消耗、仍在正常狀態中、開灤礦務局預料該局於十二月份</p>
<p>運滬之煤將較十一月份之數字、增加一萬噸、其中泰半伊給本埠各工廠、但各工廠雖多得萬噸煤斤、聞仍恐　冬或將缺煤、至於運費高漲之原因、則煤商意見分歧、若輩所舉最顯著之原因、爲價格因戰爭而自然騰貴、但均承認遠東輪船足敷應用、某硬煤入口商稱、渠往時所租之若干船隻、今巳載運西貢米、以其利厚也、</p>

<p>昨日衆業公所股市、實業股仍形冷落、各執股公司之股、稍受注意、國際信託股及上海銀公司股趨勢允佳、後者曾漲至十二元七角高價、怡　紗廠股頃因公司方面宣稱、此番中期利息祗發一元、價格倐自二十七元下降至二十六元、後又回上二角、收盤價爲二十六元二角買進、雖隔晚倫敦橡皮價漲零三七五辦士、橡皮股因受制於獲利了結、而無從伸展、上日所漲起者、已有部份回落交易雖不如前二日晨間之得達最高額、但爲數亦至厚人、就中尤以志摩、橡皮信託、克雜華等股成交最夥餘股亦甚活躍、</p>
<p>倫敦十二日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市、因大體又轉平定、僅善後借款（英發）續降一鎊、爲三十四鎊、其餘不動、</p>

<h3>紗花　細紗復有囤藏　廿支雙馬回漲七元</h3>
<p>上日疲落之紗市、昨得美棉在漲之推動、又復上升、但客銷未見活潑、加之二十支雙馬廠方開出巨量之後、市塲籌碼充濫、致壓力尙重、所以雖有良好情形、未嘗隨之升騰、然就原棉基礎論之、紗市益人佳境、般經濟寬舒之戶、復來收藏三十二支及四十二支細紗綫　、故市態愈見挺秀矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開因上日人氣不振、故美印棉雖一致在騰、情况未能十分激昂、開價二十支雙馬價爲七百二十五元、升至二十九元半、比上日漲高十元光景、旋聞外匯轉硬、市况又鬆懈、跌三四元、此價盤旋甚久、迨至收盤亦屬平靜、査半日統計一千三百九十五包、行情二十支變馬漲七元半、天女漲五元、今日有紗三十件運厦門、茲將各帮買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>同行　一、二〇〇　香港一三〇</p>

<p>厦門　一〇統計一、三九五</p>
<h3>外棉漲風加厲</h3>
<p>通花索　一百七十元</p>
<p>本棉交易尙稱不弱、因海外印美棉市漲風變本加厲、採算價大昂特昂、故人心又復挺秀、同時廠方亦活動採辦、通州花午後索價要一百七十元、棉市就世界情况論之、前途仍有高峯發現也、蘇北來源、計通花二千四百六十七包、常陰沙五百五十四包、北沙來一千六百八十包、茲將現棉成交情形列左、</p>

<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市活躍之甚、殊爲少見連日猛漲已有百餘磅音、昨日晨初又因投機者之購買、市况堅挺、後又因海外各方來電踴躍購辦、及同業之猛烈購買、結果竟最高價收盤、較之上日又漲三十餘磅音、印度棉市亦因紐約之猛漲、昨日連同預測猛漲二十餘羅比、埃及則又漲二百五六十磅音、利物浦漲二十五便士、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、日來因海外棉市　致飛漲、然本埠棉紗未能上昇、故現貨交易未能展開、各方竟有欲獲利了結者、因急於脫手求現計、彼等售價、較之洋行方面定價可廉去十餘元、或百　磅音者、然尙乏人問津也、將來紗價一旦上騰、則棉花交易即可轉呈活躍也、茲將昨日棉市以美棉七元四三七五折合送廠價計算如下</p>
<p>二十支美米特林　一四三·六〇</p>
<p>二十支　又　下級二三九·一五</p>

<h3>煤恢　木炭被截而漲　—鴻基煤新到一批—</h3>
<p>木炭行情、前因海門等到貨過湧、銷路呆滯、曾一度轉鬆、不意昨日洋涇浜碼頭、正在上貨之間、炭船突爲某方攔去、迫入虹口魚市塲、有統制來貨之意、致人心恐慌、市氣奮騰、盤子抬高、計開海門平帽炭每担七元二角、湖溪江炭八元八角、禾炭四元八角、較前日漲起五角行情、</p>
<p>鴻基煤又到二千九百五十噸、係前日華綸洋行格蘭輪運來、停靠浦東鴻興碼頭起卸、聞一俟卸淸後、該輪續往鴻基、裝儎煤斤來滬、（祖）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>燈下走筆</h3>
<p>— 秦佬</p>
<p>偶然在女革命家新沙·盧森堡（Rosa　Luxembourg）底獄中通信集裏面發　了一段對於高爾斯華綏的批評，說得極其透徹，但也極其刻毒，而且還帶累了一下我們熟悉的蕭伯納。那信是一九一七年二月　八日在鳥弄克監獄中寫給李卜克奈西（K.Liebkneeht）底夫人蘇尼亞的。話是這樣說：</p>
<p>…在一部小說中，我本來不去追求傾向的，首先總是迷惑着藝術的價値，可是這部「世界上的同伴」却使我反了常態。高爾斯華綏在這部書中顯示的智慧太厲害了。那眞會使你吃驚。不過高爾斯華綏本身却是屬於蕭伯納或王爾德一類的典型人物，也就是現在英國知識羣中最普遍的典型人物：他是許多人中間最聰明的，文雅的，但却也是腐朽的；他面對着世間一切的　過，却用懷疑的或遊戲的態度去觀察。高爾斯華綏使他作品中的主人公擺出世界上最嚴肅的面孔，那面孔却都被註出了巧妙的相嘲弄的記號，這常使我哄然大笑。但同樣的，那些主人公實際上却又都是受過好敎育的而又優雅的人，對於他們底周圍從來不去笑駡，或者很少去笑駡，就是他們眞的瞥見了可以笑駡的部分。——一個眞正的藝術家是永遠不應該用一種嘲弄的態度去和他本來創造的意義對立的。但是，蘇尼亞，請了解我，我並不是根據這個便排斥偉大風格的諷刺。譬如格爾哈特·霍卜特曼底「基督的愚事」便是近代社會最殘酷的諷刺，那種諷刺是自從百年以來便有人寫着的文體。但霍卜特曼自己却並不在寫作中露出冷笑。……高爾斯華綏便完全相反，他用裝滿了他處處要避免一點的那種智慧的描寫，使我結果得到的只是一種桌面上的感覺，——是每次一位新客走進客廳裏的那種桌面上的感覺，——就是說，不過有一種狡猾的語言要從我底耳旁滑過而已。</p>
<p>其實這段話的本身已經是帶着極濃厚的諷刺味的。「桌面上的感覺」，眞形容得無可再妙，簡直槪括了一切冷笑文學的效果。</p>
<h3>趕路——勞軍散記</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>離開傍江城，一羣人魚貫地在悠長的古道上摸索，黝黑而沉寂的週遭，響着一片草鞋觸着枯葉的聲音。夜風裏，送來尖銳的寒氣。</p>
<p>「如果天明以前趕不到鷄公山麓，這次慰勞恐怕又要伏進壕溝延展一天哩！」</p>
<p>焦灼扣繫了每個人的心扉，我也不時同轉頭，望望那古　。</p>
<p>灰冷的，牠漸漸縮小得像　個墓塚。幾點稀疏的燈火，閃動我的記憶網幕，把副官長可囑的話，重覆兜上腦膜：——「離開古城前去三十里，就是鷄公山，現在正展開劇烈的血戰。各位須記住東北方。……</p>
<p>這麼寂寞，這麽凄冷，猶如沙漠之夜，只有寒風，穿過叢林，只有古城如上幾點黯淡的燈火，引示着我們的脚步，追尋東北方。</p>
<p>走着，摸索着，夜的昏沉更深了；溜去那古城只留下一個影子。前面遼遠的，遼遠的天邊，在隱約地顯出了一抹紅光，空際還有斷續的槍聲在波動。我們把步伐加快，無限的欣悅像露珠，凝上乾草似的心頭。</p>
<p>「方向是不錯的，怎麽只有斷續的槍聲？也許還沒走到三十里吧？」一位同志這樣疑問起來。然而誰也沒有正確的答話，儘自默然地走着。</p>
<p>越過一道淺壕，古塔下面突然傳來　　急促的口令。幾條白光正集中射在我們一面慰勞隊的白布旗幟上。</p>
<p>「慰勞隊！」一位勇士驚嘆着，奔過來對我們敬禮。笑着很客氣地說：「諸位辛苦！剛纔奉到命令，知道諸位來慰勞，實在不敢當。我們的部隊已挺進了二十里，現在恐怕已越過了新墻河。沒有迎候，眞抱歉得很！」</p>
<p>「別客氣，親愛的戰士！無怪我們只聞到斷續的槍聲，原來已挺進了。」</p>
<p>「這斷續的槍聲，就是在搜索殘餘哩。」他又揮起手說</p>
<p>「哈！……哈哈！……」笑聲震撼夜空。火熱的心像出籠的小鳥，騰翔於漫無邊際的雲海。望着二十里外，一羣人都歡悅得高歌起來：「流吧，把我們的血來洗凈河山的汚點！衝吧，把我們的肉去殲滅侵略的鐵騎！……」</p>
<p>「別唱了，我們還是趕上去。假如我們趕到二十里外，部隊再前進了，我們就再趕。一直趕過去。趕過重重關山。一領隊握着拳頭這樣激昂地說着。</p>
<p>我們於是重復背上包袱，踏上田疇。那天邊遼遠的紅光，閃耀地像向着我們招手，我們步子也快得猶如怒馬奔馳。</p>
<h3>燃燒</h3>
<p>— 艾華</p>
<p>晚　瑟瑟里，粗大的楓樹迎着淡陽，昂首向天，吐着落寞而微有感慨的喘息。</p>
<p>我立着。身旁彷彿是無垠的荒漠：有一騎驅騁而來，曳着欹斜的淡影，在塵烟中，對着慘澹的落日踟跚一下，遂又重鞭起馬蹄，在無盡的大漠中踽踽地遠去了。</p>
<p>四野靜寂，我忽覺得心動怦然；躍躍身馱一抹殘陽，追逝去的蹄塵……</p>
<p>只是暝色漸深。暮靄低垂，柔柔的，心上撒落上些倦慵的暗影。我惘然，移行了幾步，脚下發出企羨的喟歎。</p>
<p>一列叢生的蒺藜紆迴的繞着。生在　圈子里，如囚樊籠，誰不欲悲慨的一呼嘯呢？只怕最後也不過給人作了「出息」的諂諛，而顯得是一隻困獸，終於成了奚落。我倒只嘗沉洏於一種遠方的懷想，愛一隻猛　的鷹隼，那樣「一蜚冲天」。斑黑的翼羽如垂天的幕，對這沉重的晚色，憤恨的怒視了一眼，再鼓撲着雙翅直飛前去，留下那樣猛烈的騰翻的聲響……</p>
<p>爲着自幼在家鄕裏就不乏這類的壯迹，耳目濡染，使我稚心上蓬勃着感奮。在燈下，在爐火邊，我熱切地從老人的口中，聆聽那些動人的傳說：一個堂兄，一房遠親，這人物於我是分外親切的；由於生就了一點傲骨，或者是因一點間隙，遭到了譏諷，詆訾，和豪紳的嫉惡；喜怒之間決定了他們的前程，年靑的肩上挑起一担行李，十幾串制錢；飄洋過海，去了，又遠了！漸漸地，知道是在一塊遼遠的土地上活着了。娶了妻，又生下了兒女。對於那種堅毅，倔强，剛愎的度着艱苦的日子的壯年，十年或者二十年在他們算得着什麽呢？垂老的人們從淡忘中又記起他的影子來了，微笑的，高昂的頭却使他永不回顧。</p>
<p>設若必要爲每一件事物覓一個解說，那這便只好說是濱海的居民是富於一種冒險的根性的遺傳吧——但却並不是找金羊毛的故事，那顯得太俚俗而太像羅曼史了。更也不是「萬里覓封侯」。一日顯貴，便連糟糠都忘記。功利在他們心里是怎樣猥瑣；他們有着比找金羊毛更堅實的決念，隻手空拳，去尋找比金羊毛更寳貴更崇高的東西。</p>
<p>這該如何令人神在呢？然而時至今日，誰曾想到因着一點感觸，它竟給我撒下這樣狠辣的悵惘？說是鄉愁，毋寗說是慚疚吧！家園破碎，而自己却蜷伏在這　狐社鼠的窟穴里苟活。又幾曾從這凈土「上享得片刻的安寗」？——早晨推　臨街的窗牖，一夜北風，掃盡了樹間的黃葉。雲天萬里，邊聲四起，有什麽可躊躇的呢？假如在我的脈管里還流竄着一些濱海人民的堅强，奮勇，猛進的血液，那我就該讓他化作鐵的意念，斬斷牢籠，重新衝向那陽光滿照的遠方，載着歡笑，載着欣幸。</p>
<p>我仰起頭，在寥廓的秋空里益發顯得孤寂。但我的胸腔却像一團烈火似的燒熾起來了。——</p>
<p>「脫却北溟程九萬，何時華表恣翱翔？」</p>
<p>我將遠去。</p>
<h3>天高</h3>
<p>— 艾汀</p>
<p>千萬別忘記</p>
<p>我們還是個活的東四。</p>
<p>大家有的是手，</p>
<p>——我們的武器。</p>
<p>手能創造一切，</p>
<p>誰來否認？</p>
<p>天「老爺」帮你忙，</p>
<p>只帶些陽光雨水，</p>
<p>剩下的是藍雲逝飛……</p>
<p>人類開始以來，</p>
<p>天給我們些什麽東西？—</p>
<p>牠祇是那樣的死板，</p>
<p>沒帶一點理性。</p>
<p>用我們的手吧，</p>
<p>創造人類的天地！</p>
<p>堅持呵！</p>
<p>光明要黏得緊。</p>
<p>靠什麽天……</p>
<h3>白菊花</h3>
<p>— 悲惸</p>
<p>母親從街上帶來了一束白菊花，十分愛惜地將她揷在花瓶裏，喃喃的說：「這是上畫的花啦……」誰又能否認白菊花挺秀的丯姿呢？她不像玫瑰般刺目的鮮艷，也沒有向日葵般的粗陋；她放在我們面前是一位嫻靜的姑娘，無邪的天眞裏流露出靜的美麗；在起先，你或　感覺她沒有可愛的香氣吧？然而她却俱有Oliver　Goldsmith筆下女郞Sophia的魔力呢！一陣陣的幽香會使你陶醉，和你躺在山石上聽着潺潺流水聲默默入睡一樣的甜蜜……是多麽一個豐富的賦與呢，是的，這是上畫的花啦！</p>
<p>由於上畫的花，我悠然想起了芳序，一個已經分別了一年的朋友。</p>
<p>他會畫圖畫，尤擅菊花和梅花。那一天，他忽忙的跑來說：</p>
<p>「我預備送你一張你所歡喜的白菊花。」</p>
<p>「呵，那來謝謝你！」</p>
<p>他拿出那張淡濃適宜的白菊花來放在桌上，搖着腿說：</p>
<p>「這是我最後你所看到的一張圖畫了，或者你再會看就，但是……，總之我們馬上到要分別了。」</p>
<p>「分別？」我不禁驚異起來</p>
<p>是的，第二天的早晨芳序留下他的朋友走了，他沒有留戀，他的前途是無限的偉大；以後我們曾收到過二封信，然而最近半年爲什麽沒來信呢？</p>
<p>這些都是歷史中的記憶了，那張白菊花上也許堆積着許多塵埃吧？今年白菊花的臨摹者呢？圓臉上仍掛着微笑嗎？</p>
<p>白菊花在陽光里愈顯得亭亭玉立，一隻痴呆的蒼蠅在花頂低迴盤旋……。</p>

<p>㳺藝界</p>
<h3>哀范朋克的死</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>一九三九年將要告終的時候，好萊塢突然傳出了一個不幸的消息，就是著名武俠明星范朋克，於十二日那天忽以心臟病的突發而逝世了。事前我們沒有知道范氏罹病的消息，可是噩耗竟突然的傳來了，死得那麼快，眞是出人意外的。范朋克的死，當然是好萊塢電影界的一大損失，他和卓別林，曼麗璧克馥，曾　足而立，共享盛名，現在他雖不大有作品，但這個藝人的名字，還深刻的印在每一個影迷的腦膜上。</p>
<p>范朋克自十七歲那年起，就獻身舞臺，早年遭過多决失敗，曾經一度改行，經營商業，後來父重新回到舞台，起初還是不得志，到最後才成名而由舞台轉上銀幕，到好萊塢拍戲，爲了養演武俠片，喜劇片竟一躍成名而爲好萊塢唯　的紅星。接着他便自己組織了一個影片公司，所有出品，由聯美發行，直到現在，他還是聯美的四大巨頭之一。經過多年的電影生活，而今他已是好萊塢的一個富翁了。我們就上面所親的一切，就可看出范朋克之得有今日，並非偶然，早年時代，也曾到處碰壁，要是意志不堅決，早就離開舞台，更談不到投身電影界哩！</p>
<p>不過最近幾年來，范朋克的境遇是太壞了。尤其是一九三六年，他的愛妻曼龍璧克馥，突然向他提出離異的要求，使他心弦上受到莫大的打擊。離婚之後，失意之餘，他就到英國去攝製影片，可是也沒有什麼成功。垂頭喪氣的回到好萊塢，已好久沒有作品和我們相見，像已往隱退似的，使一般的影迷，時常在無意中想起范朋克爲什麼沒有製作影片給我們看，那知會有這樣的不幸呢。從此我們將不再有機會看到范朋克的新片了。</p>
<h3>電影導報選定　本年新影皇與影后</h3>
<p>— 飛雲</p>
<p>據美國「電影導報」九月份之報道，一九三九年之新影皇及影后已經選定。上屆影皇泰隆鮑華，影后珍妮麥唐納倆未能連任。這次選舉雖祇有一報的讀者參加，但亦可見美國影迷們信仰之一斑。這裏且把名列十名內之男女影屋錄之如左：</p>
<p>（一）影皇克拉克蓋博爾。</p>
<p>第二　却爾斯鮑育。</p>
<p>第三　泰隆鮑華。</p>
<p>第四　羅勃泰勒。</p>
<p>第五　唐亞曼契。</p>
<p>第六　卡萊葛倫。</p>
<p>第七　埃洛爾茀林</p>
<p>第八　賈萊古柏。</p>
<p>第九　史賓塞屈賽。</p>
<p>第十　納爾遜埃迪。</p>
<p>（二）影后蓓蒂台維絲。</p>
<p>第二　卡洛郞白。</p>
<p>第三　洛麗泰揚。</p>
<p>第四　珍妮麥唐納。</p>
<p>第五愛琳鄧。</p>
<p>第六　琴述羅吉絲。</p>
<p>第七　白蓓蘭史丹妃。</p>
<p>第八　克勞黛考爾白。</p>
<p>第九　愛麗絲費。</p>
<p>第十　瓊克勞馥。</p>
<p>克拉克蓋博爾多年來不論選舉，賣座，總是名列前茅，眞不愧爲影皇。其妻卡洛郞白名僅次於影后，乃是出人意料，可稱夫榮婦貴。蓓蒂台維絲被選爲影后，可見美國影迷對這大眼明星愛戴之深。被稱爲「神秘男子」之却爾斯鮑育竟名列於泰隆。羅勃之前，魔力可謂大矣。唐亞曼契之被入選，眞是後來居上，不很容易的。</p>
<p>新片介紹</p>
<h3>寶島奇案“Charlie　Chan　at　Treasure　Island”</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>繼華納夏能之後，二十世紀　斯發現了薛尼托勒來作爲陳查禮的繼住者。華納夏能以迂殺的動作，呑吐的發音，作爲效　陳查禮的根據，這是與攝製一般以中國爲背景的電影一樣，祗是一種幻想而已——至少他缺乏了一個大偵探應有的沉着和機警。這位繼起的薛尼托勒，則更是以華納夏能的作風爲根據，而劇作者又沒有更新穎的題材來編製如許的故事，陳查禮探案將失去「刺激」觀衆的力量，在我想，那不過是時間問題。</p>
<p>譬如「寳島奇案」，果然可以說是暴露一般奸詐之徒，偵悉他人的秘史，以遂勒索巨款之願，但是作爲一部價探電影，顯然和G-Men不同的，它需要嚴密的佈局，和導演者精細的處理，像這樣大量生產下的陳查禮探案，就不得不塗上了神怪的色彩了。</p>
<p>本片的導演還能盡職。如羅迪尼表演那塲戲，他是抓住了偵探片應有的緊張，窒息的空氣。</p>
<p>西沙羅密羅是專演反角的，本片中担任羅迪尼一角，很能稱職。</p>
<h3>觀劇雜紀</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>貫大元之「戰太平」近頃南北伶人多不常貼演，大元之靠把戲，素稱拿手，已一致公認，演「戰太平」，可謂對工。頭塲「金殿」，簾內一句倒板「頭帶着紫金盔」六字，雖調門略低，但「齊眉蓋頂」四字；則翻高，博一滿堂彩；接唱散板，調門加高，益覺動聽，開打一塲，槍花純熟，身手靈活。被擒時所施「播弄鼓」，（按似槍背非槍背，似虎跳非虎跳，梨園術語稱之爲播弄鼓。）乾凈俐落，靠旗絲毫不動，無眞實工夫辦不到也。「嘆英雄失志遭羅網」之西皮倒板起，調門漲至乙宇，嗓音益入佳境，見陳友諒時之「戰立是你老爺將華雲」一句，「戰立是之「是」字唱憂調，「將華雲」三字翻高，唱在調面，些三字所使之腔，有回味無窮之妙，此亦老路也，但嗓子無本錢不能勝任，故邇時演「戰太平」者，多巳自廢此腔，聞斬小王時之做表亦佳，「摔髮」「岔步」俱見工夫，法塲一塲與陳友諒之對唱，亦極緊凑，總之此劇大元演來實已恰到好處，論今日之鬚生，人皆以富英連良爲此中冠。夫大元之藝，實不遜於譚馬，且資格經騐，允在譚馬之上也。試看今之鬚生能動靠把戲者，能有幾人乎？</p>
<p>大軸爲鄭冰如之「春秋配」，冰如身材個子扮相均佳，類似「前進坤伶」金素琴，嗓音甚衝，唱唸皆頗動聽，惟身上尚欠研究，此經騐不足之故，能待以時日，未始非可造之才。小生張連昌，未能脫俗，平平而已。</p>
<h3>百樂門盛會　慶祝三週紀念</h3>
<p>靜安寺路百樂門舞廳，爲全滬最高尚富麗舞廳之一，聲譽昭著，營業甚盛，最近新換樂隊，係由銅鼓大王奈爾遜君領導，悉爲音樂名手，倍添雅興，允足生色。本月十六日爲該廳三週紀念之期，將舉行盛會，以資慶祝，聞節目非常精彩，中外歌舞藝術團之著名者，悉已早在羅致之列。華納兄弟影片公司，亦將於是晚在廳內放映名貴短片多本，以娛嘉賓。該廳並備大批紀念物品，分贈舞客，預料屆時嘉賓如雲，熱閙情形，當爲孤島數年來所罕見，詳細節目，將在當日申新兩報披露。</p>

<h3>Hubei Chinese Troops Cross the Han River in Multiple Routes, Recapturing Duobao Bay, Boyangzi, and Zhongxiang. Japanese Troops Completely Cleared from the Outskirts of Chongyang. Chinese Troops Achieve Significant Success in Fiercely Attacking Tongcheng and Yangloudong. Jiangxi Northern Chinese Troops Advance Towards Wuning and Ruoxi.</h3>
<p>Shashi: Hubei Chinese troops, on the morning of the 12th, crossed the Han River in multiple routes and launched a major offensive against Japanese troops entrenched in various strongholds on the east bank. One route advanced to the vicinity of Duobao Bay and Luohan Temple. More than 2,000 Japanese troops tenaciously resisted. Chinese troops bravely charged and engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat more than ten times. By around 3:00 AM on the 13th, the Japanese suffered casualties across the fields and were routed. Duobao Bay was declared recaptured, with an estimated 800 Japanese killed, four artillery pieces and more than ten machine guns captured, and countless rifles and ammunition seized. More than ten Japanese officers and soldiers were captured alive. Another unit of Chinese troops simultaneously attacked Luohan Temple, where the remaining Japanese are being annihilated. Another route pushed towards the vicinity of Boyangzi, Zhongxiang, and recaptured Xihushan (2 li from Yangzi), an outer stronghold. They are now pressing the attack on Yangzi. Another unit of Chinese troops recaptured Luojiafang north of Zhongxiang, capturing one artillery piece and many machine guns and rifles. They are now jointly attacking Zhongxiang. The Japanese are already heavily besieged and extremely panicked. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: On the 12th, when a certain unit of the Chinese army captured Chongyang City, a large detachment of the remaining Japanese retreated to the railway station outside the east gate of Chongyang. Another large detachment retreated to the Kuixing Pavilion outside the north gate of Chongyang and was fiercely besieged by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. By the morning of the 13th, their food supplies were exhausted. At noon on the 13th, they surrendered to the Chinese army one after another. The Chinese army treated the surrendered Japanese troops with great comfort, which also proves that the Japanese officers lack the will to fight, and the soldiers lack the will to engage, which is an unprecedented and strange story since the start of the war. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: The Japanese troops in northern Hunan and southern Hubei, who had been subjected to a full-scale offensive by the Chinese army for two days and nights, were in a state of disintegration due to the occupation of strongholds such as Chongyang and Yangloudong by the Chinese army. On the 12th, although the Japanese troops launched counter-attacks in separate groups against the Chinese army, attempting a final struggle, they were also defeated by the Chinese army. On the morning of the 13th, the Chinese army fiercely attacked Tongcheng and Yangloudong, achieving considerable success. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tonggu: More than 4,000 Japanese troops in southern Hubei, since the 6th, had been wreaking havoc in the Sunjialong and Yujialong area from Guanbuqiao, Xianning, Maqiao, Tongshan, Daban, Cikou, Yangxin, and Jinniu. They were severely attacked by the Chinese army in multiple routes, and fierce battles unfolded. By the 10th, the Japanese army was defeated piecemeal by the Chinese, and the entire line collapsed in disarray. In this battle, more than 900 Japanese were killed, and countless weapons, ammunition, and other military supplies were captured. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Pingjiang: The Chinese troops besieging Tongcheng engaged in a fierce hand-to-hand battle with the Japanese army in the suburbs of the city on the evening of the 12th, killing more than 700 Japanese and capturing more than 100 rifles. On the morning of the 13th, they had already begun fighting for control of the city. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Pingjiang: The Chinese troops that recovered Chongyang, on the 12th, in addition to a portion solidifying their defense of the county seat, another portion immediately pursued the retreating Japanese troops. The remaining Japanese clung to the embankment railway station outside the east gate and the Kuixing Pavilion outside the north gate, putting up a desperate fight. That evening, the Chinese troops surrounded and annihilated the Japanese troops in separate attacks. After fierce fighting until the morning of the 13th, they finally completely occupied those two locations. At this moment, there were no Japanese troops in the suburbs of Chongyang. In this battle, more than 600 Japanese soldiers were killed, 15 machine guns and 134 rifles were captured, as well as many other military supplies, ammunition, and documents. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo: After the three important strongholds of Taolin, Xitang, and Yanglousi on the outskirts of Yueyang were recaptured by the Chinese army on the morning of the 12th, the Japanese army launched a full-scale counterattack that day. After a day of fierce fighting, they ultimately failed and retreated after suffering heavy losses. On the 13th, the Japanese in Yangloudong appeared to be moving towards Chongyang, and the Chinese army was intercepting them. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from here today, China has launched a large-scale counter-offensive on both the northern and southern fronts. The total coordinated action is by the Chinese troops in southwestern Shanxi, northern Hunan, and northern Jiangxi. However, this counter-offensive is still an initial action in the third phase of the war. A truly large-scale counter-offensive has not yet begun. According to news from here, the Chinese offensive in Shanxi was launched yesterday, and the Chinese offensive in northern Hunan and northern Jiangxi was launched this morning. At the same time, because this Chinese offensive was sudden and unexpected by the Japanese army, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. Also, because this offensive was launched simultaneously on the northern and southern fronts, the Japanese army is in a situation where it cannot attend to both ends. According to reliable information obtained here, the Chinese troops in central Hubei crossed the Han River last night and launched a fierce attack on Zhongxiang, recovering many towns and markets. As for the Chinese troops in northern Hunan, they have cut off the Guangdong-Hankou Railway at Yanglousi. The Japanese troops are retreating towards Puchi and Xianning, and the Chinese army is now attacking Chongyang and Tongcheng. (13th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Chinese army in northern Hunan, northern Jiangxi, and southern Hubei suddenly adopted a proactive stance, breaking the deadlock. In the past day and night, the Chinese army has recaptured several important cities and towns. According to official reports obtained here, in northern Hunan, Wulipai, northeast of Yueyang, has been recaptured following Taolin and Xitang. The Japanese troops in Yueyang are, in fact, surrounded. In southern Hubei, the Chinese army occupied Fantou, northwest of Tongshan and Daban, and continued to besiege Baishaqiaopu, northwest of the county seat. The town is an important outer stronghold of Xianning, with about 500 Japanese troops entrenched there, and they can be completely annihilated in a matter of days. Another route of the Chinese army, after recapturing Chongyang City and Dashaping, advanced south to join forces with the Chinese army advancing north to attack the Japanese in Tongcheng. In addition, there is also fighting in Puchi, and the Yanglousi Railway Station on the Guangdong-Hankou Railway has been occupied by the Chinese. In northern Jiangxi, the Chinese army crossed the north bank of the Jin River, and a powerful force advanced rapidly to the northeast with irresistible momentum. On the morning of the 12th, they captured Gaoyou City and Jingangling to the north. By noon, they continued to capture Mozishan and Tujiazhou, and then reoccupied the areas of Changshan and Diaoyutan, northeast of Tujiazhou. In total, 300 Japanese were killed in six hours. In the evening, the Chinese troops advancing eastward defeated 1,000 Japanese troops at Shitougang and recaptured the town, continuing to search and advance northeastward. Another route of the Chinese army, operating near Fengxin, has recaptured Wubucheng, west of the city, and Dahuangling, southeast of the city, cutting off the highway from Fengxin to Chitian. In the Xiushui River valley, the Chinese army is attacking Wuning and Ruoxi. Fierce fighting is currently underway near Futianqiao to the northeast. (13th dispatch)</p>

The day before yesterday, a large detachment of reinforcements arrived but was severely attacked by the Chinese army again, and the Japanese suffered even heavier losses. Fierce fighting is continuing. (13th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Huang Xuchu Discusses Matters that Guangxi Urgently Needs to Handle: Strengthening Mobilization in Various Counties to Organize Guerrilla Forces, Establishing Military-Civilian Cooperation Stations to Assist in Transportation</h3>
<p>Guilin: Huang Xuchu recently returned from an inspection tour in a certain area. According to reports, the southern military situation is under control, and it is definite that the Japanese invaders will be annihilated. The matters that various counties urgently need to handle are: (1) Strengthening mobilization in various counties, accommodating as many outstanding individuals as possible, and giving them opportunities to serve the country. (2) Organizing military-civilian cooperation stations. A station director should be established every few miles along roads that are essential for military purposes. The director will be responsible for receiving soldiers, purchasing grain on their behalf, hiring civilians to assist in transportation, and transporting the wounded. (3) Village and street militias and reserve teams in various counties should send out a number of team members on duty every day to prevent traitors. (4) Guerrilla forces should be organized from districts. The people with guns in each district should voluntarily participate, and officers should be elected by the team members themselves. Efforts should be made to enable civilian guns to exert their power and assist the army in combat. The government will also issue ammunition, and the government will compensate for any losses. The above measures will be announced and implemented soon. (11th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>General Discussion of Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>In recent days, labor disputes in the Shanghai International Settlement have occurred one after another. The labor unrest in several large companies on Nanjing Road has gradually been resolved peacefully. However, there are reports of successive strikes in factories north of the Suzhou River and elsewhere! Many of them are enterprises operated by British and American merchants. This is obviously a major social problem caused by the recent sharp rise in the prices of daily necessities. Since Shanghai became an isolated island, it still has a population of 5 million, including Chinese and foreign residents, making it a densely populated metropolis. In terms of international relations, Shanghai was the center of European and American economic activities in China before the war, and it still maintains a very important position. In this period of rising prices and difficult living conditions, we naturally sympathize with the workers. At the same time, in view of the open secrets of the previous Lun Chang labor unrest, we cannot help but wonder that if labor disputes in the settlement unfortunately expand in scope, their impact and significance will not only be general labor disputes and general labor problems.</p>
<p>The only reason for the recent labor disputes is that the workers' lives have encountered serious difficulties. This is completely different from the general disputes that occurred several years ago simply because of demands for improved working conditions. According to various sources, the demands made by the employees of commercial firms and factories in the recent disputes are mostly limited to living allowances and guarantees of continued employment. This is a fact: In recent months, Shanghai's prices have been high not only because of the international environment but also because of the speculative manipulation of unscrupulous merchants and the disruption and monopoly of evil forces, which have fueled the flames and taken advantage of the situation, causing prices to soar day and night. However, the salaries of general employees have not increased in proportion. It is conceivable that it is difficult for ordinary workers to maintain their daily minimum living standards. For example, for the staple food of rice, even the cheapest glutinous rice costs 38 yuan per picul. Each worker needs at least five he of rice per day, which costs 19 cents. For a family of five, it costs 95 cents per day. If the monthly salary is 30 yuan, it is only enough to buy rice. Other necessities such as oil, salt, firewood, charcoal, and rent are not covered, and they are all expensive. Therefore, we believe that it is indeed a last resort for employees to demand that the manufacturers and authorities increase living allowances. As for guaranteeing continued employment, the general meaning is to prevent retaliatory actions by the authorities or to prevent the authorities from laying off staff under the pretext of austerity. However, it also has a special meaning at present. There are countless unemployed people. Even if a monthly salary of 30 yuan is not enough to eat one's fill or support a family, it is still better than nothing for the current employees. The unemployed, on the other hand, regard that income as unobtainable; the unemployed compete for opportunities, which most easily arouse the malicious thoughts of the commercial firms and factories. Therefore, the demand to guarantee continued employment is also understandable.</p>
<p>In our view, every employee of every business must be able to maintain the livelihood of himself and his family so that the employee can maintain his work efficiency and the business can exert its normal vitality. The rapid and peaceful resolution of the recent strike on Nanjing Road in the central district of Shanghai can prove that the authorities have an accurate understanding of the current situation. It is not only about compassion but also about needs; it is not only for their own business but also for stabilizing social order, which is also about loving the country. Therefore, we feel an unusual sense of comfort whenever we learn that a labor unrest has been resolved. We also urge general business operators that those who have already experienced similar disputes must sincerely and kindly consider the demands made by their employees and do their best to avoid the expansion of the disputes. Even those who have not yet experienced problems must carefully investigate the living conditions of their employees and voluntarily improve their treatment. Because prices are indeed unusually high, and living conditions are indeed extremely difficult, it is necessary to put oneself in the shoes of the employees and to think about the society and the country. This is not only about compassion, but the facts show that it is the general trend, undeniable and unavoidable. This is what should be done.</p>
<p>At the same time, we hope that general employees will also consider the current environment and recognize their own responsibilities. At present, there are indeed many industrial and commercial enterprises in the Shanghai International Settlement that are maintaining a portion of the country's economic vitality. Employees should not simply use the excuse of difficult living conditions to put businesses in a position where they cannot afford to maintain operations. This can easily lead to situations that cause pain to loved ones and joy to enemies. You must know that the employees here and now are not at a time to talk about how to improve their treatment. At this moment, they must practice frugality to be worthy of the compatriots in the interior who have given up their occupations and left their families, enduring hardship and working hard to save the country in the wind and rain. Employees being loyal to their professions and reaching a reasonable understanding and cooperation with the authorities directly maintains the vitality of the business and the stability of society, and indirectly stabilizes the foundation of the national economy and reduces the difficulties faced by the entire nation at present and in the future. You must refrain from taking this opportunity to make arbitrary demands. You must know that those who operate businesses naturally hope to preserve their businesses. Even if there are eight or nine parts of difficulty, as long as there are one or two parts of hope, they will try to endure the pain and preserve the business. If the endurance is ineffective and ends in mutual destruction, it is better to have the situation collapse. Arbitrary demands, even if they succeed for a moment, often accelerate the destruction! You must also know that all kinds of destructive elements deliberately destroy, borrowing a knife to kill; they take advantage of opportunities and stir up unrest. They will never clearly tell you that it is their knife, but they still have grand and impressive theories and thrilling slogans, making you think you are acting of your own volition when you are being used, and making you think you are taking advantage of reality when you are being sacrificed forever. In the past, Shanghai had specialized arbitration agencies for labor disputes. The situation is different now, and we cannot but hope that the settlement authorities and various public law organizations will assume the task of mediation and strive for fair handling and peaceful resolution. Of course, mediation is a palliative, not a cure. To completely solve the labor disputes currently arising from living problems, it is necessary to fundamentally find ways to suppress high prices. This cannot but be hoped for by the settlement authorities through more stringent, broader, and more effective measures.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Proposes Peace Talks, Soviet Union Refuses, Argentina Suggests Expelling Soviet Union, Decision to be Made by 14-Nation Committee</h3>
<p>Moscow: Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov received a telegram yesterday from the chairman of the League of Nations Assembly's Committee on the Finnish Question, namely the Portuguese representative Dama Tae, which reads:</p>
<p>"This committee was organized by a resolution of the League of Nations Assembly convened in accordance with Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. It urgently requests the Soviet government and the Finnish government to cease hostilities and immediately begin peace negotiations at the Assembly. The current representative of Finland is present and has expressed agreement. Please reply by tomorrow (Tuesday) whether your government accepts the above request and immediately ceases hostilities."</p>
<p>On the same day (December 12), Molotov, representing the Soviet government, sent the following reply telegram to Dama Tae, which reads:</p>
<p>"The Soviet government is very grateful to have received your telegram inviting them to participate in the discussion of the Finnish question. For the reasons stated in the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs' reply to Mr. Aiwenno on December 4, the Soviet government considers it difficult to accept your invitation. Please accept our apologies. I hereby send this message and wish you well, Molotov." (TASS dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Molotov's telegram to Aiwenno stated, "The Soviet Union has not engaged in war with Finland and has not threatened it. Therefore, there is no reason to invoke Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant. On the contrary, the Soviet Union maintains peaceful relations with the Finnish Democratic Republic (referring to the People's Government formed by Gu Sinan) and signed a treaty of friendship and mutual assistance with it on the 2nd of this month. Therefore, Holsti's (representative of the Finnish government to the League of Nations) application to the League of Nations cannot be regarded as representing the Finnish people, and the convening of the Executive Council and the Assembly of the League of Nations is also unjustified. If the Executive Council and the Assembly hold meetings, the Soviet Union will not send representatives to participate." (Havas Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Geneva: While awaiting Moscow's reply to the League of Nations' request to cease war against Finland, the 14-Nation Committee has drafted a report on the Soviet-Finnish dispute, divided into three sections. The first section traces history, the second section cites laws and treaties, and the third section discusses the legal conclusions that should be drawn. During the committee's meeting, the Uruguayan representative stated that the Uruguayan government supported the proposal to expel the Soviet Union from the League. It is expected that the Argentine representative will propose a motion to expel the Soviet Union from the League, and all representatives of South American countries except Mexico will support it. It is heard that Mexico supports condemning the Soviet Union but does not advocate expulsion. Switzerland will waive its voting rights, in compliance with the Swiss Federal Executive Council's declaration of complete neutrality last year. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The thirteen-nation committee designated by the League of Nations today passed a resolution on the expulsion of the Soviet Union and assistance to Finland. (United Press dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Geneva: In order to expedite procedures, the League of Nations meeting will no longer allow representatives to deliver speeches. The Argentine proposal to expel the Soviet Union has been directly submitted to the 14-Nation Committee for deliberation. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>Geneva: It is heard that the 14-Nation Committee will submit a resolution to the Assembly this afternoon. It is believed that its content will be divided into two parts: (1) Declare that the Soviet Union has committed an act of aggression against Finland and request that member states individually provide assistance to Finland; (2) Recommend invoking Article 16 of the Covenant and expel the Soviet Union from the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Argentina's Representative Speaks: Firmly Calls for Sanctions Against Aggression, Demands the Expulsion of the Soviet Union from the League, Declares Only Option is to Withdraw from the League</h3>
<p>Geneva - The League of Nations General Assembly held a plenary session at 10:30 this morning. The Argentine representative, Mr. Feller, immediately delivered a speech, stating that in recent years, the world situation has deteriorated, and international law has been treated as mere words. Consequently, there have been instances of occupying other countries by force, persecuting dissidents on religious and ethnic grounds, large-scale forced relocation of residents (referring to Germany's withdrawal of Germans from the Baltic coastal countries), and indiscriminate submarine warfare, among other things. Some advocate maintaining silence and waiting for better times, which Argentina firmly believes is unacceptable. Argentina believes that the League of Nations must implement the principles upon which it is based. Argentina is willing to defend the rule of law and confront violence. Now, the Soviet Union has brazenly attacked other countries, disrupting the norms of the international community, causing countless casualties, and turning cities into ruins. This behavior is a provocation to the entire world. In essence, the issue at hand is not about ideology or political systems, but whether we are willing to continue associating with those who violate the rules. It is not unprecedented for a member state of the League of Nations to invade another member state, but the Soviet Union's aggression has no excuse whatsoever. In short, the Soviet Union has already placed itself outside the League of Nations' covenant. Previously, when the League of Nations Assembly decided to impose sanctions on Italy, Argentina took the initiative and resolutely expressed its support. This European war was triggered by the invasion of Poland, but the League of Nations did not receive an application, meaning there was no need to intervene. Argentina followed the member states of Europe and the Americas in declaring neutrality. However, the situation of Finland's invasion today is completely different. The Argentine government cannot help but demand that the Soviet Union be declared expelled from the League. The authority of the League of Nations has indeed been lost, but if the League of Nations does not willingly destroy itself, it can still issue a stern statement. Therefore, the Argentine government has resolutely decided on its own course of action, which is that if the League of Nations continues to tolerate the Soviet Union as a member state, then Argentina has no choice but to declare its withdrawal from the League. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Geneva - The Argentine representative, Mr. Feller, proposed to the League of Nations Assembly this morning to declare the Soviet Union's expulsion from the League. The Assembly then elected representatives from fourteen countries to form a special committee to discuss the matter. After deliberation, the committee appointed representatives from five countries—Britain, France, Bolivia, Portugal, and Sweden—to form a subcommittee to draft a resolution. The Bolivian representative, Mr. Costa du Ril, immediately proposed a draft resolution based on the outline decided by the special committee. The main points are fourfold: (1) To record the Soviet Union's act of aggression; (2) To condemn it in spirit; (3) To acknowledge that the Soviet Union has already placed itself outside the League of Nations' covenant; (4) To implement the provisions of Article 16, paragraph 4, of the covenant and declare the Soviet Union's expulsion from the League. It is difficult to say whether the Assembly can complete the voting stage on the issue of expulsion today, but it must be transferred to the Administrative Council meeting for final procedures by tomorrow. It is generally expected that the Assembly and the Administrative Council can conclude their work by tomorrow evening. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Paris - A French reporter stationed in Geneva said that if the Soviet Union must be expelled from the League of Nations, it can only be initiated by the League of Nations' Administrative Council. Soviet representatives can indeed participate in Administrative Council meetings, but it is difficult to predict whether the Soviet government will order its representatives to do so. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>China Feels Extremely Difficult About the Soviet Union's Situation</h3>
<p>Geneva - The Soviet Union provoked the League of Nations again last night by delaying its response to the League's request for the withdrawal of Red Army troops from Finnish territory until several hours after the deadline set by the League. Previously, representatives of Britain and France attending the League of Nations Assembly claimed that although the Soviet Union did not respond to the League before the deadline of 8:00 PM, any response sent last night could be accepted by the League. The League of Nations sent the Soviet Union an ultimatum requesting that the Soviet-Finnish issue be submitted to the League for mediation, but did not stipulate any punitive action if the Soviet Union ignored the League's proposal. A member of the Soviet delegation claimed yesterday that if the League allows the Soviet Union to remain a member, then the Soviet Union currently has no definite plan to deal with the League. If the League accepts Argentina's proposal to expel the Soviet Union from membership or takes other punitive measures against the Soviet Union, then the Soviet Union "will most likely withdraw from the League." The League of Nations Assembly will meet at 10:00 AM today to discuss the Soviet Union's invasion of Finland, the Soviet Union's response to the League's ultimatum, and Argentina's proposal to expel the Soviet Union from membership. According to unconfirmed reports received by the League of Nations Secretariat last night, the Soviet Union would rather withdraw from the League than succumb to the pressure from the League. The Soviet Union's position was explained to League leaders by the Soviet secretary of the League of Nations the night before and yesterday. It is widely believed that the League of Nations has somewhat changed its views on expelling the Soviet Union from membership, but there is still considerable opposition, posing a serious obstacle to the required unanimous action. The Chinese delegation firmly opposes expelling the Soviet Union from membership, for practical rather than idealistic reasons. The Chinese representatives here are deeply apologetic about their position. A spokesman for the Chinese delegation said last night, "We Chinese are in a difficult situation. If we vote against the Soviet Union, then we would be ungrateful to the Soviet Union, which has helped our country fight for its survival. If we vote against expelling the Soviet Union from membership, then the world will accuse us of joining forces with the communists." Representatives from other countries reported that they had heard that Germany was inciting the expulsion of the League of Nations' membership, as Germany hoped that the isolation of the Soviet Union would promote closer relations between the Soviet Union and Germany. Therefore, representatives from these countries also opposed expelling the Soviet Union from membership to prevent Germany from benefiting. The issue of expelling the Soviet Union from membership has not been decided. Changes in opinion are possible either way. The League of Nations committee dealing with the Finnish issue first drafted a first report yesterday morning and then decided to draft a second report summarizing Finland's legal status vis-à-vis the Soviet Union and the Soviet-Finnish treaties.

<h3>Fierce Battles Between Soviet and Finnish Forces on the Karelian Isthmus, Soviet Strategic Plan to Cut Off North-South Communication, Finnish Army Reinforcements Sent to the North in Preparation for Counterattack</h3>
<p>Helsinki - A local bulletin states that fierce battles are currently taking place on the entire front of the Karelian Isthmus, especially in the village of Muolaa. Several Soviet attacks were repelled with heavy losses, leaving hundreds of bodies behind. The Soviet army repeatedly attempted to break through the eastern front, but the Finnish army destroyed several Soviet tanks. In the Battle of Tolvajärvi, the Finnish army captured 52 Soviet machine guns and other military equipment. Three Soviet infantry battalions were annihilated, and several tanks were destroyed. Although the Soviet army launched a fierce attack on the Limola area under the cover of heavy artillery, they were ultimately defeated. Battles are still ongoing in the northern part of the eastern front. It is reported that Soviet aircraft are bombing islands in the Gulf of Finland, while Finnish aircraft are dropping bombs on enemy positions and Soviet marching troops and attacking them with machine guns. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Helsinki - Finland is currently urgently strengthening its defensive lines and sending heavy troops to the Petsamo front to bolster its strength in preparation for a counterattack. According to neutral observers, Finland's purpose is partly to contain the Soviet offensive and partly to threaten the Murmansk railway. There is no sign yet when the expected Soviet general offensive will be launched. These people expect the Soviet Union to begin its general offensive only when the lakes freeze over and can bear the weight of tanks and mechanized units. Finnish observers now feel that the Soviet troops currently fighting on the front lines are third-rate soldiers. Moscow's military authorities initially did not expect Finland's resistance to be so strong, so they fought with third-rate troops. Now they have decided to transfer first-rate troops. The focus of the war has now suddenly shifted from the Karelian Isthmus to central Finland, as the Soviet Union intends to break through to central Finland and divide Finland into two. It is reported that fierce battles are currently taking place in the area around Rovaniemi and the scenic area of Salla-Salla, as well as north of Kolosjoki. The Soviet Union has concentrated heavy troops here, and Finland has also sent troops to reinforce its defenses. According to semi-official sources, Finnish aircraft destroyed 12 miles of the Murmansk suburban railway yesterday. Soviet aircraft are not very active on the Karelian Isthmus. News from Viipuri says that Soviet troops are suffering from the cold weather. Officers have tents to live in, but soldiers are sleeping in the open on the battlefield and dare not light fires to keep warm, fearing that they will attract the attention of Finnish aircraft or scouts. According to prisoners of war, many soldiers on duty have frozen to death. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Stockholm - It is reported that the number of Soviet troops invading Finnish territory has reached as many as 1.5 million, and reinforcements are still arriving in a steady stream. It is generally believed that the Soviet General Staff will soon order a general offensive against the Finnish Mannerheim Line. In addition, the entire 9th Soviet Army is currently operating in the Uleåborg area of northern Finland and seems poised to advance to the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia. It is reported that the Red Army has suffered extremely heavy losses since the start of the war, almost five times that of Finland. In terms of tanks alone, more than 114 have been destroyed. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>Port of Viipuri, Finland - A special dispatch from a Havas reporter states that Soviet troops have been attempting to break through the "Mannerheim" defensive line in the northern Karelian Isthmus of Finland for five days, but have not yet succeeded. It is generally believed that a total of 30,000 Soviet troops are concentrated there, accompanied by ten artillery battalions, equipped with many 105mm and 75mm howitzers. Now that repeated attacks have failed, they may change their tactics. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Finnish Aircraft Destroy Soviet Railway</h3>
<p>Stockholm - According to news from Helsinki, several Finnish aircraft have destroyed a section of the railway connecting the Soviet port of Murmansk to Lake Ladoga, measuring seven kilometers in length. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Son of Finnish Puppet Fights for Fatherland</h3>
<p>New York - According to relatives of Kuusinen, the leader of the Finnish "People's Government," although Kuusinen himself is being used by the Soviet Union, Kuusinen's two sons are currently serving in the Finnish army, fighting against the Soviet Union. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<h3>Norwegian Newspaper Suggests Organizing International Army to Help Finland Resist Aggression, Rebuild League of Nations Prestige</h3>
<p>Oslo - The leading conservative newspaper "Aftenposten" suggested today that the League of Nations member states should immediately provide a fully armed army, numbering one per thousand of each country's population, under Finnish command. This move would stop the Soviet aggression and rebuild the authority of the League of Nations. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>South Africa, Finland, and Bolivia Elected as Non-Permanent Members of the League of Nations Council, China Requests Re-election</h3>
<p>Geneva - The League of Nations Assembly today elected Bolivia, Finland, and South Africa as council members. Bolivia was re-elected, Finland replaced Sweden, and South Africa replaced New Zealand. The Assembly also plans to elect China and Latvia as special council members. This matter can be decided this afternoon. Therefore, the members of the current Council are Belgium, Bolivia, the United Kingdom, Santo Domingo, France, Greece, Iran, South Africa, Peru, Finland, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Geneva - Dr. Wellington Koo, the chief representative of China attending the League of Nations Assembly, wrote to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Avenol, today, stating, "To His Excellency, Secretary-General of the League of Nations, Mr. Avenol, if China can obtain a seat as an ordinary non-permanent council member this time regarding the Far East, it is hoped that its current temporary council seat can continue for another three years, as the situation in the Far East that gave rise to this council seat remains unchanged."

<h3>Britain and France Establish Financial Cooperation Agreement to Maintain Current Exchange Rates Between the Pound and the Franc, Share War Costs in a Fair Manner</h3>
<p>London - The Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Simon, traveled to Paris earlier this month to hold talks with the French Finance Minister, Mr. Reynaud, and subsequently signed a wide-ranging financial cooperation agreement. He recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons, explaining the contents of the agreement, stating, "Since the joint meeting of the Supreme Defense Council of Britain and France last month, the two sides have decided to cooperate closely in military, economic, and other fields. The British and French Ministries of Finance concluded a financial agreement in Paris last week, with a wide scope, to implement the goal of cooperation. Because during the joint war between the two countries, it is in the common interest to stabilize the exchange rate between the pound and the franc. According to this agreement, the signatory countries shall not issue foreign debt or request loans from other countries without the consent of the other party or joint action. In addition, the two sides agreed on reciprocal measures to ensure that when one party needs the other party's currency, it can obtain it as much as possible without using gold. During the war, neither party shall implement new restrictions on the other party's goods by implementing protectionist policies or for exchange rate reasons. Once the war ends in the future, this financial agreement will remain valid for six months after the signing of the peace treaty to avoid sudden changes in the economic and financial situation of both parties. In short, this is another clear demonstration of the close cooperation between Britain and France, and I believe it will be warmly welcomed by the House of Commons. Also, when I discussed various issues with the French authorities this time, the French Finance Minister, Mr. Reynaud, showed a full spirit of friendship and understanding, which is truly admirable." (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris - The Minister of Finance, Mr. Reynaud, recently issued a statement stating that the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Simon, visited Paris on the 4th of this month to conduct financial talks, and subsequently signed a financial cooperation agreement that will remain in effect during the war and for six months after the establishment of peace. Its scope covers the British and French Empires, and applies to economic issues in addition to financial issues. This is based on the same spirit as the unification of military orders between the two sides. In essence, it is to maximize the integration of the national strength of the two countries to win the final victory. In addition, an official statement was issued stating that the British and French financial authorities have reached a satisfactory agreement on establishing a linked relationship between the currencies of the two countries, and it is recognized that it is in the interest of both parties to keep the current exchange rate between the pound and the franc unchanged during the war. Therefore, if either party needs the other party's currency to stabilize the exchange rate, it can obtain the convenience of obtaining and fully using it. In addition, the finance ministers of the two countries have also formulated a ratio for sharing some of the expenses of the variable side operations that should be borne jointly, and decided that the finance ministries of the two countries should maintain close contact and hold meetings at any time to resolve various technical issues and submit various issues of a general nature, such as price policies, for research. Responsible parties here commented on this matter, saying that from then on, Britain and France could freely use each other's currencies to meet all needs without using gold. The funds to be paid by the variable side in gold or US dollars will be borne jointly in a fair manner. As for the distribution of operating expenses, it will be measured by comparing the resources of the variable side. Roughly, Britain will bear 60% and France will bear 40%. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris - After the British and French financial agreements were announced in London and Paris respectively, political figures here recently commented that from then on, the two Allied countries of Britain and France can be said to have formed a comprehensive alliance, which is unprecedented in the history of the two countries. Only three months have passed since the outbreak of the war, but the military and diplomacy of Britain and France have been unified, and the joint meeting of the Supreme National Defense Council of the two countries is responsible for adjustment. Since November 17, the two countries have established a common plan for various issues such as military supplies and transportation, and a joint committee composed of ministers from the two countries has been organized to decide on the purchase of goods from foreign countries by the two countries to avoid competition. At this point, a financial agreement has been established to establish a complete linked relationship between the currencies of the two countries. Britain and France have always been the richest countries in Europe, and now the result of the financial cooperation between the two countries is tantamount to further combining the wealth of both parties. However, the main goal of this agreement is to link the franc and the pound, thereby stabilizing its exchange rate. From the French perspective, it will no longer be necessary to export gold to pay for the price of goods purchased from Britain, its autonomous territories, or certain neutral countries priced in pounds. Conversely, in order to meet the expenses that must be paid in francs within France, especially the expenses required by the British Expeditionary Force on the French front line, Britain will no longer have to transport gold to France for compensation. At a time when a portion of the British Expeditionary Force just arrived at the Maginot Line yesterday and stood on the front line with the French army, the establishment of a financial agreement is quite satisfactory.

<h3>Bremen Arrives Safely in Germany</h3>
<p>Berlin - The German High Command announced last night that the North German Lloyd shipping company's passenger ship "Bremen" sailed back to its home port last night from overseas. The German Navy took the necessary measures to send aircraft to protect the ship's return home. British submarines in the North Sea attempted to attack the ship but were driven away by German aircraft. (Haitong, 13th) New York - The New York Daily News commented on the German postal ship Bremen escaping the torpedo range of British submarines, saying that the ship will then be sent out to resupply the German pocket battleship Deutschland, General Scheer, and other raiding ships. Therefore, it is incomprehensible whether it is worthwhile for British submarines to treat the ship so politely, whether in terms of military interests or propaganda. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Wood Reports to the Lower House: British Air Force's Combat Record, Quality is Superior to German Air Force, Anti-German Submarine Escort System Successful</h3>
<p>London - British Air Minister Wood stated in the Lower House today about the advantages of British aircraft that since his last speech in the Lower House, there have been no major air battles. Britain has expanded its air defense forces and the effectiveness of its air force organization, both in the country and in France. British aircraft often engage in decisive battles with enemy aircraft, and the results are satisfactory, proving that British fighter jets are indeed superior to enemy fighter jets, not only with firepower twice that of enemy aircraft, but also with superior flight characteristics. When flying at high speeds, British aircraft are superior to enemy aircraft in terms of handling and operation. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London - British Air Minister Wood spoke in the Lower House last night, referring to the role of the British Air Force in combating the German submarine threat, saying that British coastal air defense aircraft are watching the sea without interruption in the cold winter wind and snow, escorting many ships every day, sometimes encountering German aircraft and defeating them, and searching and attacking German submarines. It is now known that a total of 19 German submarines have been severely damaged. It flies more than one million miles per month. Wood went on to describe a British submarine damaged in adverse weather, saying that the escort aircraft team was immediately dispatched, and the submarine was able to sail into a port in Scandinavia for repairs. When the British aircraft escorted the submarine, they shot down a German Dornier aircraft. Wood then described the achievements of the bombers, saying that the British Air Force's recent attack on Heligoland was a particularly difficult task, but the British aircraft not only flew to their destination and dropped huge bombs that directly hit it, but also fought with 20 Messerschmitt German aircraft and shot down two of them before returning to their original defenses safely. The British Air Force conducted reconnaissance flights, flying to Hamburg, Bremen, the Ruhr, Berlin, Munich, Nuremberg, and many other places. The prestige of the British Air Force is very high, no wonder nearly one-third of those who register for service are willing to join the Air Force. British Empire overseas personnel and troops will soon take up positions in the front-line air defenses. After the Polish Air Force is re-established, it will be commanded by its own officers and will be attached to the British Air Force. As for aircraft production, although the quantity has more than doubled compared to a year ago, in terms of effectiveness, it has not only doubled but has actually increased several times. New and more powerful aircraft will soon be fighting against the enemy. In response to questions, Wood said that he has carefully considered the matter of German aircraft flying to Shetland and the Orkney Islands, and hopes that the next time German aircraft come again, we will have very favorable results. We can now be confident that our air defense system is quite sound, and Britain's offensive and defensive strength is becoming stronger, so we are always in a better position to establish air superiority.

<h3>Soviet Submarine Sinks German Cargo Ship, Fifteen Shell Hits</h3>
<p>Helsinki: The German cargo ship "Bochem" was sunk yesterday off the coast of eastern Finland by a submarine of unknown nationality. According to a Finnish radio report, the submarine was Soviet. The German ship, weighing 3,300 tons, was en route from Hamburg. The submarine fired over fifty shells. The German captain and two crew members were killed. The remaining nineteen crew members reached land in lifeboats. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Bern, Switzerland: Regarding the sinking of the German cargo ship "Bolkent" by a Soviet submarine, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung recently published a dispatch from its Stockholm correspondent confirming the incident and stating that the sinking occurred in the Gulf of Bothnia. The ship sustained fifteen shell hits. The Soviet submarine's bombardment of a third-country ship while enforcing a blockade of the Finnish coast is considered a precedent. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Minor Skirmishes Between French and German Troops</h3>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters recently released War Bulletin No. 200, stating that units of our and enemy forces engaged in a brief encounter last night between the Saar River and the Warndt Forest. There was another encounter in the same area today. Both sides' artillery also shelled our forward outposts, which remain active. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters recently released War Bulletin No. 201, stating that only reconnaissance patrols were active along the line last night. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Britain Striving to Maintain Naval Superiority, Naval Construction Program Sufficient to Compensate for Losses</h3>
<p>London: Those in charge here claim that the superiority of the British Navy is becoming more complete. Although Britain has lost the Royal Oak, Courageous, two destroyers, and one submarine, totaling 55,649 tons, in addition to the Rawalpindi and four small minesweepers, totaling 18,396 tons, these losses can be compensated for by a large-scale naval construction program. Since the outbreak of the war, the naval construction program has continued to increase, and nearly one million tons of warships are currently under construction, many of which are nearing completion. The number of anti-submarine warships has more than tripled, causing great anxiety to Germany, which boasts that the German Navy's strength has greatly increased due to the addition of the Austrian Danube Flotilla. It should be noted that those joining the German Navy are only river defense patrol boats and a small number of motorboats exclusively for inland river work. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>London: Officials recently announced that British and other countries' ships are still safely entering and leaving British ports along the Indian Ocean. In August of this year, a total of 179 ships entered and 328 ships exited, totaling 617 ships. In September, after the outbreak of the European war, the number of ships decreased to 521. In October, it increased again to 659 ships, with 348 entering and 311 exiting. The number of ships entering and leaving in October is expected to increase further. (Havas, 13th)</p>

<h3>French Propaganda Claims German Army Intends to Invade Sweden and Norway</h3>
<p>London: According to a broadcast from French radio, German ships equipped to transport troops and war materials are now concentrated in Hamburg and Bremen. This indicates that Germany intends to land troops in the Netherlands or that Hitler plans to take action in the Scandinavian Peninsula. Germany may not attack the Netherlands before spring. If the Soviet Union occupies Finland, Germany will follow suit and seize a foothold in the Scandinavian Peninsula. The main targets in the Nazi plan are Sweden or Norway. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Italian Ambassador to Japan Discusses German-Italian Relations</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Italian Ambassador to Japan, Ariti, gave a speech today, commenting on various rumors regarding German-Italian relations, stating that the German-Italian alliance continues to exist and that German-Italian relations have not changed. Italy will continue to provide moral support for Germany's struggle in the future. Italy's sole purpose in maintaining a neutral policy is to prevent the expansion of the European war. (Haitong, 13th)</p>
<h3>Purges in Germany, Concentration Camps Overflowing</h3>
<p>Amsterdam: According to this newspaper "De Volkskrant," the German secret police are again carrying out large-scale arrests of anyone within Germany who was ever affiliated with an opposition party. Those arrested include not only some who formerly served in the Free Democratic Party and the Democratic Party, but also military officers. It is estimated that 4,000 people have been arrested in Berlin alone. News of large-scale arrests has also come from Leipzig, Trieste, Hanover, and industrial areas. The number of people arrested is so large that the concentration camps are overflowing. Few communists have been arrested. The German purge movement now involves officers and soldiers of all ranks of the former Stormtroopers, and even some police officers are being purged. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Swiss Confederation Elects President and Vice President, New Government Sworn In</h3>
<p>Bern, Switzerland: Another election period has arrived for the Swiss Federal Government. A joint session of the Council of States and the National Council was held today to vote in the election. As a result, all seven ministers were elected for another term. The list is as follows:</p>
<p>Interior Minister Etter (1939 Federal President)</p>
<p>Postal and Railway Minister Pilet-Golaz (1939 Federal Vice President)</p>
<p>Justice Minister Baumann</p>
<p>Political Minister Motta</p>
<p>Military Minister Minger</p>
<p>Economic Minister Obrecht</p>

All members of the Federal Government were immediately sworn in. (Note: The Federal Government is re-elected every four years, and the President and Vice President are elected from among the ministers, with terms of one year.) (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Ambassador to Belgium Returns Home for Consultation</h3>
<p>New York: U.S. Ambassador to Belgium, Davis, returned home yesterday on the "Rex" mail ship to discuss the U.S.-Belgium trade agreement. He expects surprises to occur during the European war. Davis said, "The most surprising thing about this war is that there are many surprises, but all the new surprises are still in the bag." Ambassador Davis continued, "I am very satisfied that 'all countries can guarantee their promise not to invade Belgium,'" but Belgium is still taking active preparations to prevent the worst. The Belgian King is personally responsible for Belgium's strong defense. Ambassador Davis also explicitly expressed support for President Roosevelt to serve a third term, as he is the first in the U.S. diplomatic corps to openly participate in the upcoming election war. He said, "If things continue like this, Mr. Roosevelt must be forced to participate in the third presidential election." After briefing the State Department and the President, Davis will return to his original post in Belgium. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<h3>Difficulties Persist in Romanian-German Negotiations</h3>
<p>Bucharest: There are still many difficulties in the negotiations to increase the amount of oil transported to Germany. The German claim that an agreement could be signed on Friday is an exaggeration. The German negotiators are now demanding an expansion of the quota for oil exports and that 300 oil tanker trucks be transported to Germany daily. According to the current price payment method, 25% will be handled through the clearing system, and the remaining 75% must be paid in gold. However, because Germany has long lacked gold, it has historically made payments in manufactured goods, resulting in excessive amounts exceeding Romania's current needs. As for the negotiations between Germany and Romania to change currency exchange rates, they are progressing more smoothly. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Annual Report on Mandated Islands Not Yet Sent to Geneva</h3>
<p>Tokyo: A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told a Reuters reporter today that Japan's report for 1938 on the mandated territory entrusted by the League of Nations had been sent to Geneva, but it has not yet arrived, probably due to delays. According to the chairman of the League of Nations Mandates Commission yesterday, he officially announced that Japan had not sent its report for 1938. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>Geneva: Japan yesterday appeared to refuse to submit the former German islands in the Pacific under international mandate and will unilaterally manage everything without reporting the administrative situation of the islands to the League of Nations Mandates Commission. After the World War, the League of Nations entrusted Japan with the rule of the former German-ruled islands in the Pacific. League of Nations experts view Japan's failure to report the situation of the mandated islands to the League of Nations as another indication of Japan's violation of international treaties. League of Nations officials said that Japan's actions have raised questions, as the League of Nations Administrative Council will be forced to take action. (United Press, 13th)</p>
<h3>Japan Uses Anti-American Movement to Threaten the United States on Treaty Negotiations</h3>
<p>Beijing: According to Japan's small-scale economic designer and consultant to the North China Preparatory Bank, Sakai Nozomu, if the U.S.-Japan trade treaty is not extended after its expiration, anti-American movements will flourish in all territories under Japanese control. When asked by reporters whether there was any possibility of establishing a U.S.-Japan trade agreement, Sakai replied that this would have to be decided by President Roosevelt. He also said that after the outbreak of the European war, the demand for goods between China and Japan has been increasing daily, so the United States' exports can actually be greatly increased. Therefore, he hopes the reporter will inform the President of the United States. Sakai expressed pessimism about the rural reconstruction of North China, because floods, droughts, bandits, and war disasters are all factors that impede the restoration of local vitality. Sakai denied the rumors that the reserve currency was about to collapse, but stated that the control of foreign exchange was necessary to maintain the reserve currency. (United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: When Foreign Ministry spokesman Suma greeted reporters this morning, when asked what kind of goods the proposed Soviet-Japanese trade agreement would contain, Suma declined to comment. When asked whether Soviet trade could replace American trade, Suma expressed the opinion that this was theoretically possible, but the absence of a treaty between the United States and Japan did not necessarily mean the absence of trade. Japan is taking constructive measures to adjust its relations with the United States. Suma mentioned the news reported in the newspapers that U.S. Ambassador Grew had received instructions from the U.S. State Department to continue the Tokyo meetings, stating that there were no arrangements yet for a continued meeting between Japanese Foreign Minister Nomura and the U.S. Ambassador, but it was quite possible. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Unrest in India, Police Fire on Natives, Reports of Hundreds of Casualties</h3>
<p>Karachi, India: A serious riot broke out in Kikwadpo Town, India, yesterday. Police fired on the natives, resulting in more than 200 casualties among the Indian natives. The British immediately declared martial law and rushed to the scene for rescue. (Haitong, 13th)</p>

<h3>German Government Publishes White Paper Exposing Diplomatic History, Including 482 Documents, Believes Britain Bears Full Responsibility for the War</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German government yesterday published a white paper on the important history before the current war, beginning with an introduction by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, with the following content: "The German people, under the leadership of Führer Hitler, look to the future rather than the past. However, for the war that we are forced to wage for the future destiny of our country, it is necessary to remember its origin and course in order to seek the ultimate cause. This course, in fact, has been deeply understood by all those who pay attention, and German authorities, especially Führer Hitler, have repeatedly explained it. However, because enemy propaganda has done everything possible to confuse public opinion, we specially publish official documents to prove that this war is entirely the responsibility of Britain, which is determined to eliminate Germany. After the outbreak of the war, the German Foreign Ministry published documents on the last diplomatic negotiations on the German-Polish dispute. Now, 482 documents are published, which are not limited to the course of events on the eve of the war, but are a collection of various important political events. These important events caused the conflict between Germany and Poland and Britain and France. Therefore, the Polish measures to suppress Germans after the World War, Führer Hitler repeatedly proposed generous proposals to adjust German-Polish relations, the short-sightedness of Polish government leaders, the intentional war by the British government, and London's repeated rejection of German peace proposals (including Führer Hitler's speech to the parliament on October 6) are all important facts that will be proven by the white paper documents. In short, the German people have now accepted the British challenge. With confidence in justice and a belief that they will achieve the final victory, they will not lay down their weapons until they have militarily eliminated the enemy and secured a guarantee of 'living space' for the German people." (Haitong, 13th)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German Foreign Ministry yesterday published a white paper on the important historical facts before the war, reviewing the political development of German-Polish and British-German relations. The first chapter is "The Development of German-Polish Relations," tracing back to the beginning of the determination of borders in 1919 until the efforts of Germany in the past six years to avoid serious conflicts with Poland, aiming to seek a peaceful solution to the Danzig and Corridor issues. Regarding this, the white paper publishes the talks held between Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck and Führer Hitler in Berchtesgaden on January 5, 1939, proving that Mr. Beck had absolutely no intention of rejecting negotiations based on Führer Hitler's proposal at that time. This refutes the British claim that Germany began peace negotiations starting in March 1939. The second chapter is "Britain's War Policy," emphasizing that British Prime Minister Chamberlain had issued a joint declaration of peace with Hitler in Munich, stating that "the two nations will never fight each other in the future." Three days later, Mr. Chamberlain said in a speech to the House of Commons that the British government's expansion plan would not be changed due to the Munich Agreement. Later, Secretary of War Hore-Belisha openly made anti-German remarks, defaming Führer Hitler and the German ambassador, proving that the British government actually implemented an anti-German policy. The third chapter describes Germany's good-neighborliness policy, including its efforts toward a Franco-German agreement, declarations to Belgium, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia, and non-aggression pacts with Latvia, Estonia, Denmark, and Lithuania. The Netherlands refused to accept peace guarantees. Sweden, Finland, and Norway believe that there is no need to conclude non-aggression pacts. Finally, a non-aggression pact was concluded with the Soviet Union. The fourth chapter, the last chapter, is about the evidence of Polish abuse of Germans and the situation of the tension in Danzig. The last document is a note from the German Foreign Minister to the diplomatic representatives of various countries, stating that if Britain does not interfere, the German-Polish dispute can seek a reasonable solution. Therefore, the responsibility for the outbreak of the war lies entirely with Britain. (Haitong, 13th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Government and Public Promote Aid to Finland Movement, Begin Fundraising to Help Civilians, and Vigorously Boycott Japanese, German, and Soviet Goods</h3>
<p>New York: The United States Boycott Aggressor Nations Goods Association has decided to begin boycotting Soviet goods and continue its propaganda campaign, advising consumers across the country to boycott Japanese and German goods. In addition, after former Republican President Hoover initiated this month's 17th as "Finland Day" to facilitate fundraising to help the country's civilians, people from all walks of life have formed a fundraising committee, with Hoover as chairman. New York State Governor Lehman also issued a declaration, calling on residents across the state to generously donate to support the righteous cause. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>New York: President Roosevelt told reporters today that the U.S. Red Cross has spent more than $500,000 on relief work in Europe, including $25,000 sent to Finland and $16,000 spent in London to purchase medicines for Finland. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Washington: Ever since Finland's heroic resistance, U.S. public opinion has been increasingly in favor of providing the country with practical assistance. It is reported in diplomatic circles that although Finland has expressed great gratitude for the U.S. government's decision to allocate $10 million to help the country's civilians, what it hopes for most is the supply of various military supplies, especially aircraft. However, this issue has many difficulties and may involve other countries purchasing military supplies from the United States, so it cannot be resolved urgently. The manufacturing capacity of U.S. arms and aircraft factories is ultimately limited. At present, in addition to meeting the needs of the U.S. Army, it must also fulfill orders from Britain and France, so it is temporarily unable to help other countries. Although the government is willing to comply with public sentiment and provide Finland with various conveniences, it is also inconvenient to neglect or delay meeting the needs of the domestic army and the orders of Britain and France. As for Finland's financial resources for purchasing military supplies, it is generally believed that the principal and interest of the country's debts to the United States have always been repaid on time, so it should not be restricted by the Johnson Act and can obtain new loans in the United States (the Johnson Act stipulates that countries that have not repaid the principal and interest of their debts are not allowed to borrow money in the United States). In fact, the U.S. government has decided to allocate $10 million to handle Finland's "civilian" relief efforts. Although the use of this money is limited to civilian relief, it is not difficult for the Finnish government to free up a considerable amount of cash to purchase military supplies. For example, the United States once provided commercial credit to the Chinese government, and the Chinese government used the funds it saved in various aspects to purchase American aircraft. If Finland follows China's example, there will be no economic problem. What is currently troubling is that American manufacturers are temporarily unable to accept orders, so this issue still cannot be resolved. Also, people in political circles here generally expect that the American people will certainly agree to lend a large amount of money to Finland. However, Congress will not reconvene until next month, and the Finnish authorities have repeatedly stated that only immediate assistance can be effective, which is especially important. In short, the U.S. government is currently studying the issue of aiding Finland in an all-round way, striving to take into account the needs of Britain and France and the U.S. Army, while also satisfying domestic sentiment. According to what people generally see, the government will eventually find a win-win solution. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>New Japanese Ambassador Visits German Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Berlin: The new Japanese Ambassador to Germany, Kurusu Saburo, took office on the 4th. At noon on the 12th, he paid a visit to German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to present his credentials. Ambassador Kurusu is scheduled to meet with President Hitler at the end of the month to present his credentials. (Allied, 12th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Ambassador to Italy Suddenly Leaves Rome</h3>
<p>Rome: Soviet Ambassador Goreykin left here suddenly after arriving here three weeks ago without presenting his credentials to King Victor Emmanuel III. His whereabouts are unknown. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Airplanes Bound for Finland Detained by Germany, Germany Has Tacit Understanding on Soviet Invasion of Finland, Can Be Proved by This Action</h3>
<p>Helsinki: Of the 25 aircraft purchased by Finland from Italy, only two have been transported to Sweden. The remaining 23 were detained in Germany because the German government prohibited arms from being transported to Finland. In addition, arms purchased by Finland from Hungary were also detained by Germany. Observers here commented that the collusion between Germany and the Soviet Union is actually greater than generally imagined. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>London: Diplomatic sources here recently said that the Soviet invasion of Finland was a conspiracy with Germany. This has now been confirmed. Since the start of hostilities between Finland and the Soviet Union, Germany has never provided Finland with military supplies, as has been rumored. Moreover, it has refused to allow goods from other countries to be transported to Finland through its territory, showing that Germany has no sympathy for Finland. Germany is even preparing to allow the Soviet Union to obtain certain military and economic benefits in the northern Scandinavian Peninsula, in exchange for being able to maintain freedom of action in the western Gulf of Finland (i.e., the central and southern parts of the Scandinavian Peninsula). It is still unknown whether the two countries will be able to find a suitable opportunity to implement this plan. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Plans to Reorganize Cabinet, Meeting with Republican Leaders May Be Related</h3>
<p>New York: The owner of the Chicago Daily News, Colonel Knox, the Republican vice-presidential candidate in the 1936 election, visited President Roosevelt on the 10th of this month. Officials have not yet disclosed any information about this matter. After hearing the news, people generally said that there have been rumors for the past two months that the President intends to reorganize the cabinet and co-opt Republican leaders. It is unknown whether Colonel Knox's visit to the President means he will be appointed Secretary of the Navy. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Plans to Ask Congress to Extend Trade Agreement Privilege, Government Does Not Intend to Provide Military Loans to Finland Because It Is Contrary to Current Policy</h3>
<p>Washington: The U.S. government's privilege to conclude foreign trade agreements will expire in June next year. President Roosevelt told reporters that the government will soon ask Congress to extend the term of this privilege. In addition, the government does not intend to lend money to Finland so that the country can purchase military supplies, as this approach is clearly contrary to the government's current policy. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Groups Welcome Burmese Delegation to China; Over 3,000 People Attend; Shao Lizi Delivers Speech; Delegation Pays Respects to Chairman Chiang and His Wife</h3>
<p>Chongqing – Various groups in Chongqing held a welcoming meeting on the morning of the 13th to welcome the Burmese Delegation to China. Over 3,000 people attended. Shao Lizi delivered a speech on behalf of the groups. In the afternoon, the delegation attended a public banquet held by the International Association of Youth, paid respects to Chairman Lin, and visited various government officials and the British Chargé d'Affaires. In the evening, they attended a public banquet hosted by various circles. (13th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – The Burmese goodwill mission, which arrived here yesterday, today presented a brief note of respect to Chairman Chiang and his wife. The note stated, "To Chairman Chiang and his wife, Burma respectfully wishes your country a bright and splendid future, and hopes that your country's current war of resistance will achieve an early and glorious end. The cultural relations between China and Burma can be traced back to the early historical period. Over the past thousands of years, the two countries have had good relations and frequent contact, which has greatly benefited the cultures of both countries." The note went on to express great interest in the New Life Movement led by Madame Chiang, stating, "This great movement, which establishes morality and justice while encouraging frugality and honesty among hundreds of millions of docile Chinese people, will surely produce great results." The note also expressed respect for the patriotic movement of Chinese women, stating, "The patriotic movement of Chinese women is unparalleled in the records of any other country. Chinese women are willing to place their duty to sacrifice for the country above their family duties in order to arouse the patriotic sentiments of their compatriots. We pay our utmost respect to this valuable expression of character by Chinese women." (13th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – This morning, when various circles here held a meeting to welcome the Burmese goodwill mission, the Burmese representatives all gave very interesting speeches. According to Burmese leader and journalist U Ba Cho, Japan has used threats against Burma, firstly because Japan covets Burmese resources such as oil, rice, and cotton, and secondly because Japan is extremely displeased with Burma's allowing military supplies to pass through its territory to be transported to China, so it has used airplanes to bomb Burma as a threat. All of this was a warning from the Japanese consul stationed in Rangoon to the Burmese government.</p>
<p>However, the consul has now been expelled by the Burmese side. Furthermore, according to U Ba Ling, the leader of the goodwill mission, the Burmese people are well aware that Japan's goal is to conquer the entire Asia, so "Japan's spending a lot of money in Burma to carry out anti-China propaganda is not only a waste of money, but also a futile effort. Moreover, all of Burma's culture comes from China, how can the Japanese easily alienate us?" In addition, according to Tao Misheng, the president of the Sino-Burmese Buddhist Association, "What Buddhism most abhors is the killing of women and children, but the Japanese in China have acted recklessly in this regard. I am here today to represent the women of Burma and comfort the women and children of China, because their husbands and fathers are now engaged in the war of resistance."

<h3>American Ambassador Johnson to Arrive in Tianjin Tomorrow; Denies Meeting with Kato</h3>
<p>Beiping – According to news here today, American Ambassador to China, Johnson, is scheduled to arrive in Tianjin on December 15th to handle all matters. (12th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Tianjin – American Ambassador to China, Johnson, is currently in Beiping and is expected to arrive in Tianjin on Friday morning. He will return to Beiping on Saturday or Sunday. People here believe that the Japanese blockade of Tianjin is nominally directed against Britain, but in reality it has greatly affected American interests, leading to a chorus of complaints. The ambassador's trip is probably related to the increasing difficulties faced by American businesses. It is expected that after Johnson arrives in Tianjin, he will meet with leading figures among the local American business community. (13th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping – American Ambassador to China, Johnson, today denied to a United Press reporter the rumors that he would meet with Japanese special envoy Kato to discuss adjusting Sino-American relations. Kato's visit to Beiping is to participate in the second anniversary of the "Beiping Provisional Government." Johnson is now scheduled to go to Tianjin on Friday to inspect the situation of the American僑民 [overseas residents/nationals], because the American僑民 [overseas residents/nationals] there have been greatly affected by the Japanese blockade of the concession.

<h3>Opposition to Organization of Puppet Central Government is Fierce Among Japanese Troops in North China; Two Puppet Governments of North and South to Meet Tomorrow to Discuss; Unlikely to Produce Any Concrete Measures</h3>
<p>Beiping – The "Provisional Government" of Beiping is scheduled to hold a celebration tomorrow to mark the second anniversary of its establishment. It is reported that Liang Hongzhi, "President of the Executive Yuan," Chen Qun, "Minister of Internal Affairs," and Wen Zongyao, "President of the Legislative Yuan," of the "Renovation Government" of Nanjing will fly here today to attend the celebration and to attend the "Joint Conference" of the "Provisional" and "Renovation" governments to be held in Beiping on December 15th and 16th. According to Chinese newspapers, the "Joint Conference" will establish a "Central Political Conference" to discuss concrete plans for establishing a "Central Government." However, according to informed local sources, these discussions are unlikely to produce any concrete measures, as key figures in the "Provisional Government" of Beiping are opposed to the organization of a "Central Government," fearing that "North China's political power" will be transferred to Nanjing as a result. In addition, some sources say that the Japanese troops in North China are also strongly opposed to the organization of a "Central Government." Some parts of the Japanese army are even dissatisfied with Wang Jingwei. In view of this resistance, the discussions at the "Joint Conference" are of little importance. However, whether it can make the future organization of the Central Government slightly closer is something that people in Beiping will watch with some interest. (13th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Guizhou Ordered by Madame Chiang to Rush Production of Cloth Shoes</h3>
<p>Guilin – The provincial government, acting on a telegram forwarded by the military, received an order from Madame Chiang to produce 500,000 pairs of cloth shoes to be distributed to the front lines to comfort the soldiers. Orders have been telegraphed to over 20 counties, including Guilin, Pingle, and Liujiang, to undertake the production separately. (12th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Manchukuo Imposes Multiple Oppressions on Christians</h3>
<p>Hong Kong – According to a certain foreigner who recently arrived in Hong Kong from the Northeast, the Japanese in the Northeast are imposing various oppressions on Christianity. Although there are no overt prohibitions, Christians and students at church schools are forced to worship at temples, which is touted as the "nation-building" spirit of Manchukuo, causing disputes, and then using this as a pretext for oppression. As a result, several church schools have been forced to disband, and the arrest of pastors is not uncommon. Much of the property of the churches has also been confiscated by the Japanese puppet regime. (13th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Relief Commission Adjusts Distribution Stations for Refugees</h3>
<p>Chongqing – The Relief Commission has recently adjusted the distribution stations for refugees because the original stations have either changed due to shifts in the war situation and changes in distribution routes, or because the distance between two stations is relatively close, all of which is uneconomical. The stations in Suide and Tianshui have been abolished, and the stations in Xi'an and Baoji have been merged into the Xi'an-Baoji Station. The stations in Xuchang and Nanyang have been merged into the Xuchang-Nanyang Station. The stations in Hengyang, Zhuzhou, and Shaoyang have been merged into the Hengyang-Zhuzhou-Shaoyang Station. The stations in Jinhua and Yongjia have been merged into the Jinhua-Yongjia Station. In addition, because the Chinese forces in the guerrilla areas of western Zhejiang have launched fierce counterattacks, and refugees are passing through Ningbo in an endless stream, a station has been added in Ningbo to facilitate distribution.

<h3>Difficult to Renew Sino-American Commercial Treaty; American Government and Public Opinion Both Advocate Restraining Japan; Japanese Goods Exported to America Will Suffer a Serious Blow; Bill to Ban Exports to Japan Will Be Passed; American Professor Speaks in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Professor Steiner of Political Science at the University of California in Los Angeles traveled west during his vacation to inspect the Far East. He spent two months in Japan, Korea, the Northeast, and North China. He briefly stayed in Shanghai last week. A reporter from the Da Zhong News Agency paid a special visit to him at the International Hotel and had a conversation with him about the current situation of the triangular relationship in the Pacific.</p>
<p>It is Absolutely Difficult to Renew the Sino-American Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>According to Professor Steiner's observations, (1) there is no possibility of renewing the new commercial treaty between the United States and Japan, and (2) the legislation proposed by Senator Pittman to ban exports to Japan will soon be acted upon in Congress and can be passed at a good time.</p>
<p>The Purpose of Resolutely Abandoning the Treaty is to Restrain Japan</p>
<p>Professor Steiner told reporters that the main purpose of Washington's decision to notify the abandonment of the 1911 Sino-American commercial treaty was to give the State Department the flexibility to deal with the Japanese issue. If this commercial treaty were to be renewed or a new one established, would the United States not be defeating its own purpose? Therefore, it is very clear that the United States does not want to sign a treaty with Japan.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Exported to America Will Suffer a Major Blow</p>
<p>According to Professor Steiner's observations, even if there is no commercial treaty between the United States and Japan, trade will continue. If there is only a lack of a commercial treaty, it will not affect the export of American goods to Japan. However, Japan's most-favored-nation status obtained from the Sino-American commercial treaty will be eliminated. Therefore, the import of Japanese goods into the United States will inevitably be seriously affected. Because after Japan loses this commercial status, it will have to pay the ordinary tax rates stipulated by American law for exports to the United States.</p>
<p>American Public Opinion Tends to Sanctions</p>
<p>Professor Steiner continued, American public opinion now tends to sanction Japan. This dominant public opinion will take effect in Senator Pittman's major discussion of the bill to ban exports to Japan, because this is a good situation for the ban to pass in the next Congress. In short, what Americans deeply hate are aggressors and manufacturers of war. Therefore, their preparations to take action are progressing with each passing day.</p>
<p>Steiner Stays in Shanghai for Two Weeks</p>
<p>Professor Steiner will stay in Shanghai for two weeks. During this time, he will go to Nanjing and other places along the Yangtze River, and then go south from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Annam. Because he urgently needs to return to the country before the start of the next semester, he is afraid that he will not have time to visit Free China, which he regrets. Professor Steiner also visited Shanghai during the summer vacation of 1937, and was in North China when the Lugouqiao Incident occurred.</p>
<h3>Corpses Line the Streets of Nanshi; Drugs are More Abundant Than Rice; Opening of Iron Gates Has Quadrupled the Number of Drug Trafficking Agencies; Number of People Entering Nanshi Has Been Quite Crowded in Recent Days</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the third day after the opening of the iron gates on the New Canal. The number of people entering and leaving Nanshi was still quite crowded. The order has been good in recent days. Another piece of news obtained by the reporter is that after the opening of the iron gates, the number of drug trafficking agencies selling "heroin" and "white powder" in Nanshi has quadrupled due to the opening of the iron gates. A Western reporter once</p>
<p>Entered Nanshi to Describe the Experience in Detail. According to reports, he was able to enter Nanshi on the first day of the opening of the iron gates and saw an old man with ragged clothes in a remote alley, whose hat was decorated with many paper ingots and white ashes. It is said that the old man is the boss who sells "heroin." He followed the old man to a dilapidated house and climbed the stairs through a small ladder. The so-called drug trafficking agency is in a small room upstairs. The selling price of each bag of "heroin" in Nanshi is one dime. The</p>
<p>Special Phenomenon in Nanshi is "More Heroin Than Rice." This news was also told to the Western reporter by the old man. The old man also pointed to the ragged corpses lying in the slums and said, Seeing this proves that heroin can now be bought at will in Nanshi. About five beggars were found dead in the streets due to drug addiction. This "heroin" is in the hands of the Japanese, coming from Dingxing, Beiping. It is said that the monthly profit is very high, about 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The "Avenue Police" has a list of drug dens, and collects taxes from the drug trafficking agencies there on a monthly basis. Two years ago, there were about 200</p>
<p>Drug Trafficking Agencies. According to the old man, all drug trafficking agencies are founded by wealthy people. It is rumored that since the opening of the iron gates on the New Canal, the number has quadrupled. Although there are food shops on the streets of Nanshi, the entire Nanshi has been shrouded in a miserable scene. What we see and hear are only lonely widows and the barking of dogs in the alleys. In the past two days, the number of people along the Min'guo Road in the French Concession has been</p>
<p>Quite Crowded. Residents Entering and Leaving Still Enter and Leave Through the Small Doors on Both Sides. Because There Are Many Women and Children Mixed Among the Residents Entering and Leaving, in addition to sending detectives to guard the iron gate at the north entrance, the French patrol room also transferred a female detective yesterday to inspect women with suspicious behavior. When arriving at the positions of the Japanese soldiers and "Avenue Police" outside the iron gate of Min'guo Road, they must show the pre-received "resident certificate." As for the middle iron gate of the New Canal, it was not opened yesterday, so there are problems with vehicles passing through. No vehicles were seen passing through there, but bicycles can pass through the small door next to the iron gate, but they must not ride on them and must be supported by hand.</p>
<h3>Movement to Promote Honesty and Shame to be Promoted Today</h3>
<p>The movement to promote honesty and shame launched by all circles in this city is being actively promoted, sparing no effort. It has aroused great attention from society. Everyone says that in this isolated island, where the environment is turbid, the rise of this association is like a morning bell, awakening people and causing them to reflect deeply. Its efforts to encourage the customs of the times and save people's hearts are truly commendable. In order to expand publicity, the association has launched a movement to promote honesty and shame for several days starting from the anniversary of the Xi'an Incident on the 12th. A declaration has already been published, and the major newspapers have carried it in their daily and evening editions in the past two days, which has moved all citizens of Shanghai. In addition, a large number of propaganda materials have been printed and distributed to all sectors of society in order to promote the movement universally and encourage each other. Today, the association is scheduled to be a propaganda day for the cultural and youth circles. In addition to sending personnel to contact the authorities of various schools, to promote the significance of the honesty and shame movement, it will also be extended to vocational and youth circles, including shop assistants, workers, apprentices, etc.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council and Court Agree to Punish Hoarding Rice with Penal Servitude; Confiscate Stored Rice, Announce Misdeeds; Chinese Ratepayers Association Issues Warning</h3>
<p>In recent months, the price of rice has been rising daily, reaching about 50 yuan, causing significant losses to the general salaried class and lower-level members of society. If this continues, the order and tranquility of society will be seriously endangered. The authorities of the two concessions attach great importance to this incident. In addition to discussing appropriate measures to prevent hoarding and lower rice prices, in order to prevent those who only seek profit and disregard the suffering of the poor from being obsessed with their mistakes and continuing to hoard, the Shanghai Municipal Council has discussed and agreed with the authorities of the Special No. 1 District Court on punitive measures. Those who are confirmed to be hoarding will be detained by the police and sent to the court to be sentenced to a corresponding period of penal servitude in accordance with the Police Offences Act, their stored rice will be confiscated, and their misdeeds will be announced as a judgment on their reputation, so as to make the hoarders vigilant and awaken.</p>
<p>Warning Letter from the Chinese Ratepayers Association</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the two concessions sent a letter to all ratepayers in the city, saying, "This is a notice to inform you that although Shanghai is a speculative port, the objects of speculation are only blue grids, letter exchanges, real estate, and foreign exchange. The failure of the first three items is a historical fact, and the failure of the latter is still uncertain. However, taking rice as the object of speculation has only started this year. Food is the people's livelihood, this is a fact. Therefore, although rice can theoretically be used as an object of speculation, in fact, because it is related to the livelihood of all people, the government and society regard those who hoard rice and monopolize it as profiteers and punish them. Why do these profiteers lack people's sympathy? Because their actions can lead people to death, and they are considered killable by the Chinese people. The price of rice in Shanghai has risen from 12 or 13 yuan in May and June of this year to 45 yuan today. The common people cannot eat their fill, and the rice in the warehouse is rotten. Just imagining it is unbearable. The local authorities have already announced sanctions against hoarding and revoked protection. The people's hearts are greatly reassured and the public opinion is unanimous. Why? Because they support the authorities in taking emergency measures in extraordinary times to save the lives of all the people in the concession. Public opinion is law, and there is no room for hesitation, research, argument, or evasion. Therefore, we hereby notify you that if any of our ratepayers are hoarding rice for profit due to a temporary impulse, please immediately recognize the needs and interests of the public, as well as public opinion, and first implement the public announcements of the local authorities. Otherwise, the regret will come soon. Sincerely notify you, and we hope you will take it into consideration."</p>
<p>Xujiahui Rice Shops Prevent Rice Grabs</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the rice shops in Xujiahui, such as Yongheng Rice Shop, etc., because the panic over food among the people has reached its extreme in recent days, and the poor people have found it difficult to make a living, and there are many civilians in the area, they are afraid that they will be forced by life to take risks, and they have heard that there have been gatherings to grab rice. As a precaution, after hearing the news, the rice shops have closed the iron railings of the counters, allowing buyers to trade only across the railings and not allowing them to enter or leave, in order to prevent accidents.</p>
<p>Japanese Words and Deeds Are Not Consistent</p>
<p>The North-China Daily News said that after the two concessions jointly issued a notice, officials hoped that the rice prices would soon be affected and greatly reduced. 5,000 shi of Saigon rice are expected to arrive today (13th) by ship and be stored in the warehouse. Yesterday (12th), it was heard that six boats of rice that were detained by the Japanese authorities in the Suzhou River near Zhongshan Road last week have now been sold to Japanese merchants. There are also six boats of rice, each carrying 5,000 shi of rice, which are now being detained in the Suzhou River near Caojiadu. It was also heard that about 13,000 shi of rice were transported from the mainland to the river at the Mekan Road intersection of Zhabei, and are still being detained there. A spokesman for the Japanese army announced yesterday that a large amount of rice from the Japanese army is currently being transported to Shanghai, which will be sold cheaply for the benefit of the Chinese people, so as to lower rice prices.</p>
<p>Large Amount of Saigon Rice Successfully Transported to Shanghai</p>
<p>The various rice firms in this city have successively entrusted French firms Dafu Foreign Firm, Swedish firms Fugui Foreign Firm, and British firms Heyi Foreign Firm to negotiate the successful transaction of Saigon foreign rice, reaching 320,000 bags. In addition to the fact that one-third of them have been loaded and transported to Shanghai, yesterday, the "Qinlai Baotuo" Mahler Wheel arrived in port with 1,500 tons of Saigon rice, or 15,000 bags of No. 1 rice, and 500 tons of crushed rice, or 5,000 bags. More than 10,000 bags will arrive within the next few days on the "Suzhou" Wheel, and 15,000 bags on the "Chongqing" Wheel. As for the transportation of domestic rice from various places to Shanghai, although it has been obstructed, the source has not been interrupted. Yesterday, about 6,000 bags were transported to Shanghai by train.</p>
<p>Difficult to Change Long-Standing Trading Practices</p>
<p>Xu, the owner of a rice shop on Xiafei Road, was summoned to the patrol room by the French Concession Police Department on suspicion of hoarding. Afterwards, according to legitimate rice merchants, it is a long-standing trading practice in our country that most transactions are settled with one word. Therefore, although there are regulations that prohibit selling short and buying long and shortening the delivery period, it is difficult to thoroughly implement them. Because there are no order contracts or clear procedures in the transactions between the two parties, after the three-day delivery period expires, or based on personal feelings, another three days will be extended, and the extension continues in this way, which is no different from the previous time limit. As for the stockpiles of hoarders, they are all arranged in thousands of ways, and the situation is complicated. For example, the food transported to Shanghai by land and water, if the ships are docked at the docks in the Hongkou area, the goods will be piled up in the Hongkou warehouses. There are also some hoarders who are deeply afraid of reports from the concession authorities and civilians, and specifically store the rice in special areas that are not within the reach of the Shanghai Municipal Council. The authorities will have no way to investigate clearly. Since the Shanghai War, private residences rented by individuals in the two concessions as warehouses are everywhere. The only plan now is to request the Shanghai Municipal Council to promptly formulate forms, publish them in the newspapers, and order general merchants and customers to register and report all the rice stored in the warehouses. This requires greater efforts from the authorities of the two concessions.</p>
<h3>Japanese Manipulate Puppet Labor Union; Force Workers to Join; Force Workers Employed by Foreign Firms to Join; Attempt to Control Everything and Launch Disturbances</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that after the so-called "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association" threatened the workers, it was learned yesterday (12th) that the Japanese have launched an attempt to place a large number of workers employed by foreign commercial and industrial enterprises in the Eastern District under the control of the Japanese army. The means of the "Welfare Association" were first noticed by the public on the morning of Sunday. The reason is that the association's enforcers stopped a truck carrying workers from the British-owned China Soap Company in Yangshupu that morning, forcing the driver to drive the workers to the association's headquarters at 127 Yangguang Road, and then forcing the workers to join the association, paying a membership fee of one yuan per person and a monthly fee of two dimes. At 7 a.m. that morning, 700 workers in the China Soap Company factory did not enter the factory to work. It is heard that the informal leader behind the association is</p>
<p>Manipulated by the Japanese, and the leader is a Chinese, but he takes orders from a Korean. According to unconfirmed sources, there is an even higher head above them, a certain Japanese who once served as a colonel in the Japanese army. It is generally believed that the purpose of the existence of the association is to use various methods to make the workers employed by foreign businesses or other large enterprises in the Eastern District join the association as members. Once these people control the workers, they can make the workers fabricate any dissatisfaction and announce a strike. According to informed sources, the purpose of the association seems to be to launch disturbances for no reason, such as the strike at the China Soap Company factory, as well as the disturbances by the workers at the China Aluminum Steel Products Factory, the Borden Manufacturing Factory, the China Paper Products Company, and the Jardine Matheson Cold Storage, etc., which were all instigated by the so-called "Chinese Workers' Welfare Association." It is heard that</p>
<p>The recent settlement of strikes at the German-owned Lulin Foreign Firm, the Swiss-owned Rong Shipyard, the Jardine Matheson Cotton Mill, and the Pinghe Foreign Firm were also organized by the association. According to investigations, the conspiracy of this "Welfare Association" under the wing of the Japanese is not specifically aimed at opposing foreign businesses of any one country, but mostly at British businesses. The reason is that most of the factories in the Eastern District are owned by British businesses, but it is not that the movement has an anti-British nature. Factories owned by American, German, and Swiss merchants have also been affected.</p>
<h3>Manipulating and Monopolizing Daily Necessities - Opinions on Legal Sanctions - A Letter from Jiang Liquan</h3>
<p>Jiang Liquan, the current Shanghai Second Special District Court Judge and professor at Shanghai Daxia University's Shanghai Law School, expressed his opinion yesterday on the legal sanctions against manipulating, monopolizing, and speculating on daily necessities, especially food. He noted that neither the concession authorities nor the people have ever filed a complaint or private prosecution with the court. He sent a letter to the leaders of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and various organizations, urging the two concessions authorities to encourage reporting. The letter stated:</p>
<p>"Since the Nationalist army withdrew westward from Shanghai, the government's economic measures have been severely hindered. Consequently, industrial and commercial enterprises have lost their adjustment, and prices have soared, making it difficult for people to survive. The recent price hikes have been even more severe, especially for food. 'The people regard food as their heaven.' To strive for coexistence and co-prosperity among mankind and to maintain the universal love of nature, it is imperative to seek immediate relief measures. 'With sufficient food and clothing, people will know honor and shame.' Without a sense of honor and shame, they will take risks, leading to great disorder. Those responsible for public security should also take decisive action promptly. Furthermore, 'an elephant is killed for its tusks.' Hoarding speculators will lose their support when the situation changes.</p>
<p>"Yesterday's newspaper reported that the concession authorities have already issued public announcements as warnings. However, cunning merchants are foolish and shameless. Written warnings are far from enough to curb their greed. They must be reinforced with resolute action to achieve results. Effective sanctions can still be sought through the law. Regarding the manipulation and monopolization of daily necessities, the ordinary criminal law, except for obstructing transportation by means of violence and coercion, has no explicit provisions for punishment under the current circumstances. However, the 'Regulations on the Administration of Agriculture, Mining, Industry, and Commerce during the Extraordinary Period' (hereinafter referred to as the 'Regulations') promulgated by the National Government have clear provisions. These Regulations are legally enacted laws. According to Article 2 of the Agreement on Chinese Courts in the Shanghai International Settlement and Article 3 of the Agreement on the Establishment of Chinese Courts in the Shanghai French Concession, Chinese courts in both concessions can apply these Regulations. They have the jurisdiction to try the acts of Chinese and people from countries without consular jurisdiction who violate these Regulations.</p>
<p>"According to Article 1 of the Regulations, food, oil, salt, grain, coal, coke, cotton, silk, hemp, wool, and their manufactured products can be managed by the Ministry of Economic Affairs with the approval of the Executive Yuan. The method of management can be based on Article 2 of the 'Measures for Assessing Prices and Suppressing Speculation and Manipulation during the Extraordinary Period' (hereinafter referred to as the 'Measures') promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. The local administrative authorities, together with relevant agencies, chambers of commerce, or trade associations, can organize a fair price committee. First, the administrative authorities should order all merchants to report their inventory costs (Article 9 of the Measures), and the committee will assess the selling price and profit, and report to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval as the designated fair price. If the concession authorities object to the wording of the local government, they can make appropriate changes. However, the participation of the concession authorities is essential to be effective. It is heard that there is also a fair price committee being organized in Shanghai, but it needs to be strengthened according to the measures promulgated by the Ministry."</p>

<h3>Issuance of New Currency Notes to Supplement the Legal Tender in Shanghai - The Second Batch of Fractional Currency Notes, Worth 250,000 Yuan, Has Been Issued - The Central Bank and the Bank of China Issue One-Yuan Notes - Large Quantities of Five-Yuan and Ten-Yuan Legal Tender Have Been Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank issued the second batch of fractional currency notes on the 8th of this month, they have been fully distributed to the silver and money industry and the four major companies. Applications from major factories, firms, and various trade associations have been reviewed and approved accordingly. It is reported that a total of 150,000 yuan has been issued as of yesterday. However, in order to prevent large amounts from flowing into the occupied areas, the issuance method has to be taken seriously. The third batch has been contracted to be printed by the American company, Yong Ning Company. Once printed, it will be issued immediately after the first batch. Regarding the one-yuan notes, large quantities have been shipped in. They are new notes in red from the Central Bank and blue from the Bank of China. Many banks and firms have been exchanging them at the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications in recent days. As for the subsidiary currency notes (ten-cent and twenty-cent), they will be issued and exchanged immediately after they arrive in Shanghai from Hong Kong. Therefore, there will be no shortage of one-yuan notes, subsidiary currency notes, and fractional currency notes. Furthermore, large quantities of five-yuan and ten-yuan legal tender have also been shipped to Shanghai from Hong Kong on foreign ships. Therefore, the legal tender in Shanghai is very sufficient, and there is no need to panic.</p>
<h3>Workers at the Third Wing On Textile Factory Go On Strike Yesterday - Labor and Management Are Negotiating</h3>
<p>The Third Wing On Textile Factory, located on Maigen Road in this city, is owned by Wing On Company and has more than 3,500 workers. Recently, due to the rising cost of living in Shanghai, they appointed representatives to meet with the factory authorities to request a year-end bonus equivalent to five months' salary. However, the factory only agreed to pay each person a reward of five yuan, which was far from the workers' expectations. As a result, negotiations reached a deadlock. When work ended at 6:00 PM the previous evening, the day shift workers stayed in the factory, refusing to leave, as the factory had not provided a satisfactory response. The night shift workers also entered the factory one after another and joined the strike. The factory further sealed off all entrances and exits. Upon receiving the news, the police also dispatched a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to guard the factory. It is reported that labor and management are still continuing to negotiate, and the workers are insisting on the conditions they proposed, earnestly requesting the factory to accept them.</p>
<h3>Regular Air Service between China and the Soviet Union Commences</h3>
<p>The international air route from Chongqing, China, to Moscow, the capital of the Soviet Union, officially commenced on the 5th of this month. It is understood that the "Chongqing" giant aircraft takes off from Chongqing and arrives at Hami (哈密). Then passengers transfer to an aircraft of the Sino-Soviet Aviation Corporation to Alma-Ata (阿拉木圖) in Soviet territory, and then transfer to an aircraft to Moscow (莫斯科). The entire journey can be completed in four days. The Chongqing-Hami section is organized by the Ministry of Communications of China, with a ticket price of 1,650 yuan in Chinese currency per person. The Hami-Alma-Ata section is organized by the Sino-Soviet Aviation Corporation, jointly established by China and the Soviet Union, with a ticket price temporarily set at 83 US dollars. The Alma-Ata-Moscow section is organized by the Soviet Union, with a ticket price of approximately 120 US dollars. It is reported that there is one through flight per week, and each section is connected to the next.</p>
<h3>Under the Heavy Pressure of Life, Starving People Rob a Grain Store</h3>
<p>At about 5:00 PM yesterday, more than 100 impoverished people suddenly broke into the San Tai Grain and Flour Store at No. 239 Marlang Road in the French Concession. They robbed more than 60 bags of flour and fled in all directions. The store immediately telephoned the police, who dispatched detectives to the scene. One suspect was arrested on the spot and taken to the police station. After questioning, he was released. When the impoverished people rushed in, the doors and windows of the store were all smashed.</p>

<h3>Increased Freight Costs Lead to Another Coal Price Hike - There Is No Shortage of Coal in the Shanghai Market at Present - Coal Ships Are Being Requisitioned Due to the European War</h3>
<p>Dalu Bao reports that, according to the opinions expressed by major coal merchants, the prices of hard coal and bituminous coal in this city will soon rise sharply. This situation is mostly due to increased freight costs, rather than a current shortage of coal. The cheapest price for hard coal in Shanghai is currently 108 yuan per ton, but it is expected to rise to around 126 yuan. In fact, some coal merchants are already selling it at a price of around 126 yuan per ton. North China bituminous coal is now sold for 40 yuan per ton, an increase of six yuan compared to last month. Indian bituminous coal is sold in this city for 112 yuan per ton. Most coal merchants cite increased freight costs as the reason for the rise in coal prices. Another reason is the devaluation of legal tender. The freight cost for coal shipped from India was about 20 yuan per ton in August, but it has now increased to 32 yuan. According to a certain company in North China yesterday, the company is able to maintain the lowest coal price because its coal ships were leased at the time of the outbreak of the European War. However, three of them were recalled last month to serve in the war, and the rental cost of the replacement ships has soared. If the ships leased before the European War are not sold, the company can supply Shanghai with bituminous coal at a selling price of 40 yuan per ton. If new ships are leased to replace them, the price will naturally rise. The consumption of coal and coal balls in this city is still in a normal state. The Kailuan Mining Bureau expects that the amount of coal it ships to Shanghai in December will increase by 10,000 tons compared to November, most of which will be supplied to various factories in this city. However, even though the factories have obtained an additional 10,000 tons of coal, they are still worried that there will be a shortage of coal this winter. As for the reason for the high freight costs, the opinions of coal merchants differ. The most obvious reason cited by them is that prices naturally rise due to the war, but they all admit that there are enough ships in the Far East. A certain hard coal importer said that some of the ships he used to lease are now carrying Saigon rice because it is more profitable.</p>
<h3>The Case of Japanese Military Police Beating an American Ends with a Japanese Apology - Mr. Glassford Expresses Satisfaction - A Note Was Sent to the Japanese Side with a Promise to Settle the Matter</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the U.S. Yangtze River Patrol Force, told reporters that he now considers the unfortunate incident involving an official from the U.S. Naval Purchasing Bureau and a Korean man, which occurred on the Bund last week, to be resolved. This morning (the 13th), he formally sent a note to Admiral Imamura, commander of the Japanese Naval Forces stationed in Shanghai, informing him that he formally considers the matter to be closed. He is very satisfied that Lieutenant Hayashi has explained the matter to the U.S. Consulate here and has apologized. As far as he is concerned, the matter has been resolved amicably. Rear Admiral Glassford went to Wuhu for a routine inspection and returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon (the 12th) on the U.S.S. Luzon. Regarding his trip to Wuhu, Rear Admiral Glassford said that no special events occurred during the voyage and there were no changes; everything was as before.</p>
<h3>Singapore Increases Restrictions on Imported Goods - Products Entitled to Preferential Tariffs Can Obtain Certificates and Continue to Be Shipped and Sold as Usual</h3>
<p>After Britain and Germany declared war, the Singapore government announced restrictions on the import of 54 kinds of goods. In mid-month, it issued a second ban, increasing the restrictions to 76 kinds of imported goods. This order also stated that for goods not subject to restrictions imported into Singapore, it is still necessary to obtain an import certificate from the local government. There are a total of 236 kinds of goods that are completely prohibited from import. Flour, peanuts, raw oil, clothing, ornaments, beer, wool, rayon, meat, and sporting goods, children's goods, etc., are also on the list. Furthermore, all products entitled to preferential tariffs can apply for certificates and continue to be shipped and sold as usual.</p>
<h3>The Truth About 150,000 Copper Coins Is Revealed</h3>
<p>The French-language "Journal de Shanghai" reported on the 13th that, according to news obtained from various sources yesterday, when the French police were searching a car, they suddenly found two boxes of copper coins, totaling as many as 150,000 coins, worth 500 yuan. It has now been confirmed that what was seized was two bags of scrap copper, mostly copper locks, pipes, and chains, as well as some old copper coins mixed in, but all of them have not been used for many years. As for the reason why the police made the arrest, it was because the origin of the copperware was unknown. When asked, the carriers did not know how to answer, so they were suspected of being stolen goods or being transported by car for sale.</p>
<h3>Workers at the Lun Chang Factory Request an Increase in Rice Subsidies - Management Agrees to Consider and Respond Later</h3>
<p>Since the new factory of the British-owned Lun Chang Dyeing and Weaving Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, resumed operations last month, labor and management have been relatively peaceful, except for a brief dispute over the workers' request for an increase in lunch time, which was resolved. However, in recent days, the price of rice has soared to more than 40 yuan per picul, making it difficult for the workers to maintain their livelihoods. Therefore, the workers requested the management to increase rice subsidies on the 11th. The method is to provide a rice subsidy of 5 yuan per month when the price of rice is above 20 yuan per picul, 10 yuan when it is above 30 yuan, and 15 yuan when it is above 40 yuan. It is reported that the management has agreed to consider and respond later.</p>
<h3>Three More British Warships Withdraw from the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The English-language "China Press" reports that the British government decided some time ago that, given the current situation on the Yangtze River, it is no longer necessary to keep ten British gunboats stationed between Shanghai and Hankou, and that military needs elsewhere are more urgent. A large number of trained officers and men from these gunboats can be transferred to active duty. In view of this, the British naval authorities ordered two British naval river gunboats to withdraw from the Yangtze River in October. Now, three more British gunboats are about to withdraw. At that time, only two British gunboats will remain in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and three will remain in Free China.</p>

<h3>Charcoal and Firewood Shipped from Taizhou to Shanghai Are All Detained - Five Ships Have Been Inspected - Requesting the Municipal Council to Negotiate for Their Release</h3>
<p>Since the blockade of the Ou River, this city's supply of firewood and charcoal has depended solely on goods from the Taizhou area of Zhejiang Province. Unexpectedly, recently, the firewood and charcoal ships from that area arriving in Shanghai have all been detained when entering Wusong. It has been confirmed that the ships of Jinbaoxing, Jinyongli, and Jinrui have been detained. Some of the goods have been unloaded and confiscated, while others have been intercepted and unloaded from barges in Yangshupu.

<h3>A Shooting Occurred on Avenue Dubail Last Night - The Victim Was an Unstable Element - The Reason for the Shooting Was Unequal Distribution of Loot</h3>
<p>At 5:35 PM on the night before last (the 12th), a shooting suddenly occurred in the alley next to the branch of Lao Sanyou Barber Shop at No. 138 Avenue Dubail (commonly known as the North Caojiazhai). The victim was approximately 24 years old. When the reporter from China News Service heard the news, he immediately drove to the scene. The details of the investigation are as follows:</p>
<p>Drenched in Blood</p>
<p>When the reporter arrived at the destination, he saw the body lying face up at the entrance of Changsheng Lane, with his head facing west and his feet facing east. He was wearing a gray coat, a white short shirt underneath, and lined spring trousers with foot bindings and yellow leather shoes. His hair was combed back, his face had pockmarks, his eyes were open, and his mouth was open. Blood was all over the ground, a very tragic sight. A crowd gathered, and rumors spread, but no one could agree on what had happened.</p>
<p>Unequal Distribution of Loot</p>
<p>It is reported that the deceased's surname is Zhang, his given name is Xiao Er, also known as Xiao Sanzi, age 24, from Yancheng. He used to be an informant for detectives. Recently, he joined a certain faction's work and was ordered to join the "Police Officer Training Center" at No. 122 Avenue Dubail for three months of training. Unexpectedly, during his training period, Zhang was secretly active outside and bought a six-shot revolver for 500 yuan. He gathered colleagues from the center and specialized in robbing various places in western Shanghai. A few days ago, Zhang gathered his accomplices and robbed more than 4,000 yuan. Zhang attempted to keep it all for himself and did not give any of it to his accomplices. Therefore, his accomplices were dissatisfied and had the idea of ​​assassinating him.</p>
<p>Died from Bullets</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM on the 12th, Zhang was still gambling carefree in the Shenji gambling den in Xinkang Lane, Connaught Road. He won three or four hundred yuan and returned to the Gonggan Primary School (i.e., the "Police Officer Training Center") on Avenue Dubail. He bragged to his accomplices about how skillful he was at gambling. At that time, his accomplices saw an opportunity and asked him to go out for a treat. Zhang did not know their trick and happily went out with two men in suits and two men in Chinese clothing. When they reached the intersection, the two men in suits pulled out pistols and forced Zhang to walk into the opposite alley. At that time, Zhang argued fiercely with them. One of the men in suits said, "Damn it, don't talk nonsense, kill him!" After speaking, one of the men in Chinese clothing fired eight shots in a row, one of which hit Zhang in the head, one in his right hand, and the other six in his lower body.</p>
<p>The four murderers, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled westward towards North Caojiazhai. After the incident, the Jing'an Temple Police Station heard the news, but because the location belonged to the Chinese territory and was not under the jurisdiction of the police station, the body was still exposed there. At about 8:00 AM yesterday, several people from a certain faction arrived and investigated the shooting situation with the residents there. Then they took the bullet casings left on the ground for research. As the reporter was writing this article, a certain faction sent an ambulance to take the body to the "Coroner's Office" for examination.</p>
<h3>Prisoners Trafficking and Using Drugs - Sentenced to Many Years in Prison - Guard Sentenced to Five Years for Dereliction of Duty</h3>

On the 27th of the same month, the chief guard discovered this and found evidence, and reported it to the management department, which transferred the two guards, Li and Tu, and the inmate Jin, to the Second Special District Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation and prosecution. During the investigation, Tu Kun felt guilty and fled to escape punishment, and the court issued an arrest warrant for him. Subsequently, the prosecutor concluded the investigation and filed a public prosecution for dereliction of duty, selling narcotics, and drug use. The case has been heard by Judge Sun Pengxian, with Li Yanzhang and Wei Qing as defense lawyers. The hearing was concluded, and the sentencing date was set. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Sun arrived at the Second Criminal Court to announce the verdict.

The sentences were merged to be one year in prison and deprivation of civil rights for twelve years. The trial of Tu Kun was suspended. Li Han, who was originally released on bail, was ordered to be detained in the detention center. Jin was sent back to prison.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Becomes a "Bad Area" - Thugs Extort Money - Forcing Residents to Pay Protection Money</h3>
<p>Under special forces, Shanghai West is full of gambling dens and opium dens. Gamblers and addicts flock there, so it has become a "bad area." Local thugs run rampant and do anything, so cases of theft and shooting are frequently reported. At about 2:00 PM yesterday, four or five thugs went to the residents of Xin Sen Lane and Yong Ting Lane to extort protection money of five or six jiao. If the residents objected to paying, they would resort to violence and held sharp knives. So the residents were angry but dared not speak out and paid the amount required. After collecting the money, they gave a receipt stamped with the words "Zhang Xing". It is said that the address is at a certain number in Yuxing Lane.</p>
<h3>Punishing the Master Thief</h3>
<p>Feng Qishan, a Chinese detective of the General Police Station, and Xu Decheng, a detective supervisor, arrested a group of master thieves from Anhui, including Zhao Jinyou, at the Ningbo Business Hotel at No. 430 Guangxi Road and the Tianjin Road Hotel at No. 496 at 4:15 PM on the 18th of last month.

<h3>Autopsy Performed in Shooting Case Involving Police Apprehending Thieves to Examine Bullet - No Traces of Bullets Found in Any Part of Body - Deceased Was a Pork Merchant - Injuries Wounded One Thief Awaiting Trial After Recovery</h3>
<p>At 7:05 PM the night before last, two robbers armed with weapons broke into the Hehe Xing Rib Noodle Shop at No. 106 Beihai Road (i.e., Sixth Ma Road) in the Public Concession, robbed 30 yuan in cash and fled. The owner chased after them, blew his whistle, and called the police. The police officers on duty heard the sound and arrived to track down the robbers. The robbers fled into Hubei Road and south to Avenue Edward VII, turned west, and ran past the intersection of Dongxin Bridge Street. Police officers from the British and French Concessions joined forces to pursue them, resulting in a shootout between the robbers and the police, resulting in two people being shot down on the spot.</p>
<p>The death and injury have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the pedestrian who was shot and fell to the ground at the intersection of Rue de l'Est Cité in the French Concession was Yin Weijun, age 38, from Hangzhou, residing at No. 24 Lianzhu Lane, Avenue Edward VII. It is said that he used to run a Korean brothel and is now a pork merchant in Hongkou. That night, he was passing through the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Rue de l'Est Cité with a friend when he was hit in the chest and left breast by a stray bullet. He was rushed to Guangci Hospital by the French police, but he died before he could be treated. The body was then taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Coroner's Office. When the prosecutor of the Second Special Court was requested to come for an examination at noon yesterday, at the request of the police, the bullet was removed from the deceased's body to study whether it was the bullet fired by the police or the bullet fired by the robber resisting arrest. Therefore, the coroner performed a detailed examination of all parts of the body and found no traces of bullets. After the examination, the prosecutor questioned Yin Sunshi, the deceased's wife, and the witness Lu Jinbao, and according to the report of the Western detective, the official announced that Yin Weijun had died from a gunshot wound and ordered the body to be collected by Yin Sunshi. As for the thief who fled to Zhejiang Road, Avenue Edward VII, he was shot more than ten times and fell to the ground unconscious. A Spanish pistol with six bullets was found next to him. Chang had his car sent to the police hospital for treatment. Because he was unconscious, he could not be questioned, so his name is also unknown. Yesterday morning, the police only sent the evidence to the court and filed a public prosecution against the injured person for robbery and attempted murder, requesting a postponement. Judge Feng approved the request and ordered the case to be tried after the injured person had recovered.</p>
<h3>Thugs Extort Money on Bridges over the Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>Feng Qishan, a Chinese detective supervisor of the General Police Station, found that recently there have been some rascals who specialize in threatening pedestrians on various bridges along the Suzhou Creek to swindle money. Therefore, at 7:00 PM last night, he arrested nine criminals, including Chen Xiaosanzi, You Buhong, Jiang Yanlong, Zhu Huaixin, Qian Asan, You Yuren, Li Sanwanzi, Xiong Daliuzi, and Shen Jinfu, all from Jiangbei, near Beijing Road and Yu Qiaqing Road. They were all taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, the police lawyer Zhang Dayin presented the case and requested a postponement.

<h3>Counterfeiting Tiger Balm - Mastermind and Accomplice Severely Punished Separately</h3>
<p>Tiger Balm, produced by Tiger Balm Garden, is widely sold in the market and is a common household medicine. Recently, the company found counterfeit products on the market and began a secret investigation. It was later found that Deda Foreign Goods Store at No. 14 Yongqing Lane, Dongxinqiao in the French Concession, was the main agency for selling counterfeit products. Therefore, the company reported to the General Police Station. Chinese detective Song Bingzheng and detective supervisor Zhou Honglin arrested Yu Wende, the owner of Deda Foreign Goods Store, and seized 100 dozen counterfeit Tiger Balms. After questioning, they learned that the manufacturing agency was located at No. 114 Wusong Road, so they went to seize some of the raw materials and arrested the mastermind Feng Bonian, and brought them to the police station together. They were escorted to the First Special Court. Hong Shihau, a lawyer from Tiger Balm Garden, arrived in court and filed an incidental civil lawsuit. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit according to law. The trial was concluded, and yesterday morning Judge Tang announced the verdict. Feng Bonian conspired with others to deceive others and counterfeit a registered trademark and was sentenced to eight months in prison and fined 800 yuan. Yu Wende was fined 1,000 yuan for helping to sell goods that he knew were counterfeit trademarks. If the fine is commuted to labor service, it will be calculated at a ratio of the total amount to the number of days in six months. The civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial. 1,200 boxes of counterfeit Tiger Balm and one sheet of counterfeit trademark samples were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Strange Bird or Black Insect? Flying Over Shanghai</h3>
<p>It is rumored that on the 11th, around 6:00 AM, tens of millions of birds resembling geese flew over the city. However, according to someone who arrived from Hongkou yesterday, millions of small black flying insects were seen in Hongkou that morning, forming a swarm resembling a black cloud, covering an area of more than two "zhang" square. They flew over Hongkou and disappeared, but no one knows what these black insects are. The reported birds resembling geese may be a misidentification of these black insects.</p>
<h3>Fire Alerts</h3>
<p>Lugia Alley in the city, No. 14, Lane 70, the home of Ma Youxing, caught fire accidentally at 11:40 AM yesterday. At that time, the fire trucks were still at Anping Street extinguishing the remaining fire at the refugee shelter. Upon hearing the alarm, due to the short distance, the hoses were quickly connected to pump water for firefighting. The fire was extinguished in a short time, with only one room on the upper floor slightly damaged.</p>
<p>Shanhaiguan Road, No. 19, Lane 406 (i.e., Rui'ai Li), the Daxing Eyeglasses Manufacturing Factory, suddenly caught fire at 1:50 PM yesterday due to carelessness. Because there were many celluloid eyeglass frames piled up in the factory, it was easier to ignite. The fire quickly became fierce and immediately burst through the roof. As a result, two buildings were burned down, causing significant losses. Eight people were burned, and three others perished in the fire.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, According to a statement by the involved party, Miao Xihua, he was surprised by the news article titled "Antique Giant Merchant Miao Xihua Accused of Swallowing Family Assets," published in your paper on the 12th of this month.

<h3>Major Fire in Nanshi Yesterday, a Refugee Shelter Completely Destroyed, Neighboring Rosewood Workshop Caused Damage, Over a Hundred Refugees Have Been Relocated</h3>
<p>At 11:30 AM yesterday, a major fire suddenly broke out in the refugee area of Nanshi. The fire originated from a rosewood workshop opened by Pan at No. 76 Anping Road in the refugee area, and the flames spread quickly due to the dry weather. Soon, the fire spread to the neighboring Nos. 72 and 74, the 88th Refugee Shelter established by the Nanshi Refugee Area Office. The shelter housed a total of 140 to 150 refugees. At the time, the fire was fierce, and the refugees fled in disarray, causing temporary chaos. The host, Father Rao, the director of the office, Director Gu, and Japanese soldiers all arrived at the scene to maintain order. Subsequently, fire trucks from the East and North Districts Fire Brigades of the area rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after about two hours. The rosewood workshop and the entire building of the refugee shelter were completely burned down, and all the refugees' belongings were destroyed. In the afternoon, Father Rao and others, considering that the refugees urgently needed to be resettled, discussed the aftermath in the district. It is now heard that the refugees have been relocated to nearby refugee shelters.</p>

<h3>Shen Bao Cup Sino-American Charity Basketball Game, Chinese Representative Team Selected, Li Zhenzhong and 11 Others, Zhou Jiaqi as Coach, Banquet for All Representatives Tonight and Uniforms Will Be Measured</h3>
<p>The Third Shen Bao Cup Sino-American Charity Basketball Game, jointly organized by the Shen Bao, the English-language "Da Mei Wan Bao," and the YMCA, is scheduled for 7:00 PM on the evenings of the 19th, 21st, and 22nd of this month at the YMCA basketball court on Jing'an Temple Road. The selection of the Chinese representative team has attracted considerable attention from all parties. Due to these extraordinary times, the Shen Bao authorities have again invited Zhou Jiaqi, Ling Xitao, Shen Kunnan, Wang Shoufang, and Qian Xucang to serve as the selection committee. They met at the Atlantic Hotel on the 12th (yesterday) to discuss the matter. Ma Yinliang, Ma Chonggan, and Shen Zhenchao attended from the Shen Bao. It was decided to invite the following gentlemen to be representatives of the Chinese team and to invite Mr. Zhou Jiaqi to serve as coach and Mr. Shen Kunnan to serve as manager. Although the selection of the Chinese team was carefully discussed, omissions are inevitable. Given the matter concerns international honor and is a charitable cause, support is certainly welcome. The Shen Bao authorities have also scheduled a reception for the entire representative team at 6:30 PM tonight at the Atlantic Western Restaurant on the Fourth Horse Road, and each will be presented with a complete set of jerseys and shorts to boost morale. Measurements will be taken on the spot tonight. It is hoped that our Chinese athletes will raise their eyebrows and exhale strongly at the YMCA court at that time, win glory for the country, and retain the championship. The full team lineup is as follows:</p>
<p>Li Zhenzhong, Chen Xuechong, Wang Nanqun, Shen Yugong, Xu Wenkui, Chen Xianglong, Zhuo Guorong, Sun Hupei, Yu Xunzi, Chen Bangzhen, Zhang Jiakui, Li Zude</p>
<h3>YMCA Basketball Game Yesterday, Youlian Lost by a Miserable Point, 43 to 44 Defeat to Maihong, Xufang Fought Hard Against Little Bears but Also Lost</h3>
<p>YMCA basketball was exceptionally tense last night. In the game between Xufang and Little Bears, Xufang's defense was tight and impenetrable. Even the strong Carson was helpless. Unfortunately, due to accumulating fouls, Little Bears scored six points on free throws, leading by one point, 10 to 9, at 7:30. In the second half, Lu Dazhen and He Xiaoguang were very active. Dazhen made five out of five shots, and He also contributed three times. However, the two guards, Zhao Jinfu and Zou Ziren, were successively penalized off the field, and there were no substitutes available, so they had to play with only four players. As a result, they suffered a miserable defeat of 27 to 35. In the final act, Youlian fought Maihong. Although Maihong was last year's champion, their strength this season is inferior to last year. At the end of the first half, Youlian trailed by three points, 23 to 26. After the restart, Youlian tied the score at 26 each. Until the last half-minute, Lu Gusui made a push under the basket to take the lead at 43 to 42. Unexpectedly, Ke Fumen, in a shot near the basket, hit the bullseye precisely. The ball dropped, and the buzzer sounded. Youlian ultimately suffered a miserable defeat by one point, 44 to 43, with Maihong winning narrowly.</p>

<h3>Remedial Methods for Basic Subjects for This Year's University Freshmen, Recently Promulgated by the Ministry of Education</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News Agency) The list of freshmen admitted through the unified entrance examination for national universities in the 28th year has been distributed by the Ministry of Education. Freshmen of national vocational schools and provincial and private vocational schools above the vocational level also conduct their own entrance examinations. The level of basic subjects among freshmen in various schools may not fully meet the standards. If those with relatively weaker levels are not remedied and trained in basic subjects, they will hardly be competent for advanced academic research. In order to remedy this situation, the Ministry of Education has ordered all schools to instruct teachers to strictly supervise freshmen and appropriately increase teaching hours so that they can make daily progress and meet the standards. Referring to the methods of the previous year, the "Remedial Methods for Basic Subjects for Freshmen in National Vocational Schools and Above in the 28th Year" have been formulated and ordered to be implemented by all schools. The contents of these methods are recorded below:</p>
<p>"Remedial Methods for Basic Subjects for Freshmen in National Vocational Schools and Above in the 28th Year: (1) All vocational schools and above (hereinafter referred to as 'institutions') should provide remedial instruction to freshmen entering the school in the 28th year (hereinafter referred to as 'this year's freshmen') who have a relatively weak level of basic subjects, in accordance with these methods. (2) Institutions may adopt ability-based grouping methods for teaching Chinese, English, and Mathematics to freshmen, dividing them into groups A, B, C, and D according to the level of each subject. The most proficient should be placed in Group A, the next most proficient in Group B, and so on. (3) When implementing the ability-based grouping method for freshmen, institutions may use testing methods to ensure the accuracy and precision of the grouping. (4) After the ability-based grouping is implemented for Chinese, English, and Mathematics, the teaching materials for each group may be formulated separately, taking into account the level of the freshmen. The teaching hours for groups with lower levels may be appropriately increased, and extracurricular practice should be increased. When necessary, a portion of the required courses in the first grade may be reduced and moved to later grades for supplementary instruction. (5) Freshmen in departments of the faculties of Arts and Law and the College of Agriculture where Mathematics is not a required course may be exempt from supplementary instruction in Mathematics, but may separately supplement instruction in History, Geography, Biology, etc. (6) In addition to the three subjects of Chinese, English, and Mathematics that must be supplemented for freshmen in colleges of Science, Engineering, Agriculture, and Commerce, supplementary instruction in Physics and Chemistry may also be provided separately if necessary. (7) At the end of the first academic year for this year's freshmen, institutions should conduct rigorous examinations. Students who fail one of the subjects requiring supplementary instruction should retake it. Students who fail two subjects should repeat the grade. This method should be announced to the freshmen at the time of admission so that all students know what to strive for. (8) No credits will be awarded for the increased hours in supplementary subjects. (9) These methods shall be promulgated and implemented by the Ministry of Education."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Experimenting with Five-Year Vocational Schools, Eight National, Provincial, and Private Schools Already Experimenting</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News Agency) Regarding the proposal at the Third National Education Conference this year to "establish five-year vocational schools in addition to the existing two-year and three-year vocational schools at the higher education stage, enrolling junior high school graduates and students with equivalent qualifications," the review opinion was that the principle of parallel operation of the current vocational schools and the new five-year system could be established. However, for the fields of Art and Music, it is necessary to uniformly change to the new system in the future. Which other subjects should adopt the new system and which should apply the old system should be decided by the Ministry of Education after detailed deliberation by experts. The resolution was passed. In accordance with the resolution, the Ministry of Education has invited experts for detailed discussion and decided that vocational schools will adopt the five-year system starting from the 28th year, starting with Music, Art, Sericulture, and Veterinary Medicine. When schools are experimenting, they should still prepare plans and submit them to the Ministry of Education for approval and to the Executive Yuan for record. It has been learned that the National Academy of Art, the National Central Vocational School of Technology, the National Northwest Vocational School of Technology, the National Xikang Vocational School of Technology, the Jiangxi Provincial Industrial Vocational School, the Private Wuxi National Studies Vocational School, the Private Wuchang Art Vocational School, and the Private Lixin Accounting Vocational School have been approved by the Ministry of Education to pilot the five-year vocational school system starting from the 28th year.</p>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Sold Off Non-Stop</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday: HSBC's official rates remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange was entirely soft, as Hong Kong Electric, Chinese banks, and speculators continued to sell. However, because HSBC's absorption was still good and Western merchant Sassoon also took the opportunity to buy in a lot, the softening was limited. During the morning, initially affected by the renewed fall in British and American exchange rates, it opened with a tight British and tight American market. Later, although the Japanese banks bought in, the amount was not large and had no impact. Subsequently, under the selling pressure from Chinese banks, Hong Kong Electric, Chinese merchants, etc., it was announced that it would harden. At one point, British gold reached 4 pence 640625, and the American exchange also hardened to 7 yuan 625. However, at that time, HSBC, Sassoon, and Western firms bought in, so the softening trend was blocked, and by the time the market closed at noon, it was 4 pence 625 and 7 yuan 59375. The result was a softening of 0625 for British gold and a cheaper 09375 for American exchange than the previous day. The trend for futures is still similar to the spot market.</p>

The central bank's official rates for various exchanges remained the same. At the opening of the market, the spot selling price for British gold was 4 pence 565, and the American exchange was 7 yuan 46875, which was flat for British gold and tight for American exchange by 03125 compared to the previous close, due to the fall in exchange rates. After the opening, it was heard that the Japanese banks bought in slightly, but the market had no impact. HSBC's official rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was announced as up by one cent. After this, the Chinese banks sold first, followed by Hong Kong Electric and speculators, so the positions were suddenly filled, and the situation reversed and softened. British gold went from 4 pence 59375 to 640625, and the American exchange went from 7 yuan 53125 to 625. Among them, HSBC absorbed a lot, which led to the Western firms buying in. Soon, Sassoon also came to buy aggressively, and the market once softened. The American exchange once tightened to 7 yuan 53125, and at the same time, British gold also softened to 4 pence 609375. Then, with the buyers satisfied and Hong Kong Electric and Chinese merchants coming to sell again, the situation heavily hardened again. By the time the market closed at noon, the spot selling price for British gold was 4 pence 625, and the American exchange was 7 yuan 59375.

<h3>Hong Kong Banks Stop Buying: Gold Price Further Drops, Breaking the 4,100 Yuan Barrier</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for pure gold continued to decline, and the downward trend was particularly intense. This was mainly due to the continued strengthening of the exchange rate. In particular, Hong Kong banks were inactive because the quoted gold price in Hong Kong was lower. Buyers who had held bullish sentiments also hesitated to move forward. As a result, those with generally weak long positions were increasingly eager to sell, causing the market price to break through the 4,100 yuan barrier due to the lack of support. As for the day's situation, the opening price in the morning was 20 yuan lower at 4,140 yuan. Subsequently, due to the continued strengthening of the exchange rate, the price gradually fell to 4,086 yuan. Although it stabilized slightly at noon, securities firms returned in the afternoon and sold heavily, causing the price to fall further to a low of 4,065 yuan. Afterwards, a certain money exchange business came in to buy again, so the closing price was 4,082 yuan, a sharp drop of 78 yuan compared to the previous day. The total trading volume for the day was approximately 2,000 taels. Gold jewelry sold for 5 yuan less per unit. The price of Customs gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Drops 78 Yuan</p>

The opening price fell by 20 yuan, and gold shops sold 10 taels to money exchange businesses at 4,140 yuan. Shortly after, a certain money exchange business also sold on behalf of long positions, but there were few buyers, and the price fell another 40 yuan. Silver shops sold 30 taels to money exchange businesses at 4,100 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold shop and securities firms came to buy at a lower price. At the same time, there were reports that HSBC was buying foreign exchange, and the market stabilized slightly, rebounding by 30 yuan. Money exchange businesses sold 10 taels to gold shops at 4,130 yuan. Soon after, the exchange rate became stronger again, and trading became scarce. Although a certain gold shop continued to buy at a lower price, sellers continued to come. Money exchange businesses and a certain securities firm were particularly eager to sell, and soon the price fell below the 4,100 yuan barrier. Money exchange businesses sold 30 taels to a certain silver shop at 4,086 yuan. At noon, a certain silver shop profited by covering their positions, and the price rebounded by 9 yuan. A certain silver shop bought 10 taels from money exchange businesses at 4,095 yuan. Later, gold shops sold 20 taels to money exchange businesses at 4,093 yuan as the closing price for the morning session. In the afternoon, both securities firms and gold shops were eager to sell, and buyers were hesitant. The opening price fell by 13 yuan, and securities firms sold 10 taels to silver shops at 4,080 yuan. Later, under the selling pressure, the price fell another 15 yuan, and money exchange businesses sold 10 taels to silver shops at 4,065 yuan. Afterwards, a certain money exchange business suddenly came in to buy again, stopping the decline and causing the price to rebound. Soon, the price rose by 19 yuan, and money exchange businesses bought 30 taels from silver shops at 4,084 yuan. Later, securities firms sold 20 taels to money exchange businesses at 4,082 yuan as the closing price for the evening session.

The selling price of spot gold by gold shops was several yuan higher than the pure gold price, while the purchase price was reduced by 10 yuan. The current margin gold price was more than 50 yuan lower than the quoted price, and there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Sells for 5 Yuan Less</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael was initially still 420 yuan at the major shops. But at 9:45 AM, they reduced it by 5 yuan. There was no change after that. In the end, the major shops changed to 415 yuan, and the price was the same in new shops. The purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Prices Plummet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of British and American gold pounds was quite abundant, and the market was weak. Customers were frequently selling British and American gold notes, and the market price plummeted. The evening price for British gold notes was 46 yuan and 20 cents, and the price for American notes was 13 yuan, 10 cents, and 2 cents. The price of Hong Kong notes fell sharply due to the abundant supply of Hong Kong currency. The supply of Singapore and Dutch notes increased, and the market was weak.

The prices of other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Prices Weaken</h3>
<p>Recently, the sources of supply from various routes have been controlled by a certain party, resulting in fewer arrivals at the port. Yesterday, after strict price limits were imposed, transportation and sales became cautious again, and the supply was affected again. However, holders of stocks and speculators dared not store too much, and merchants who had not yet sold their goods were also eager to circulate them to avoid losses, as the market trend had declined for several days. It is speculated that the rice market seems to lack any chance of a turnaround for the time being. To avoid significant losses, sellers are following the market and selling, while general merchants are still waiting and watching. Even those who are cutting down on activity are still not moving. As a result, transactions are light, and prices continue to decline. As the market was about to close, the situation continued to decline without any rebound. As for glutinous rice and local pointy rice, etc., besides those who believe that the sources of supply have been cut off and that there may be a continued price increase, and who are still insisting on not selling lightly and maintaining the original price, the rest are all selling at lower prices, with price decreases ranging from half a yuan to one yuan. The closing prices were: Changbang special japonica rice 45 yuan, general market goods 43 to 44 yuan, medium quality 42 yuan or so, Wuhu japonica 42 to 43 yuan, special Bo rice 40 yuan, and lower quality 38 to 39 yuan, special white Luxiang pointy rice 41 yuan, and lower quality down to 38 yuan, Kejian 36 yuan, and lower quality down to 33 to 34 yuan, Bian Yuan 41 yuan to 39 yuan, Yinyuan 39 yuan, and Saigon pointy rice 37 yuan. It is estimated that the total trading volume in the city was only 4,000 to 5,000 bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday, there were more than 4,000 bags of local Xian rice from the Jiangbei and Jingwu areas, and more goods are expected to arrive at the port continuously. In the early market, due to hoarders selling, and Yangmi pouring in, the selling prices of various Xian rice continued to decrease by 40 to 50 cents. Special Kejian rice was only 37 yuan, general market goods were 36.5 to 36 yuan, and lower quality was only about 35 yuan to 34.5 yuan. The city only sold about 2,000 bags of spot goods in shops.</p>
<p>Yangmi passenger goods successively arrived in Shanghai, and there are two more batches expected to arrive outside the unloading warehouse today and tomorrow. Because of the money situation, many firms are devaluing and selling at the market. Therefore, Gao Xigong has fallen from 37.8 yuan to 37.2 yuan, and rice crumbs are only 33.2 yuan, and lower quality down to 32.4 yuan. There are many more goods returned to the market seeking to be sold. The opening price of the original package was 44.4 yuan in the early market, and the market had already fallen by 40 cents in the middle market. In the afternoon, it was only 33.5 yuan, and the buyers were scarce. The market opened more than 600 tons, and the price was one yuan less than the previous day, and the spot price was also less than 40 to 50 cents, with only 3,000 bags traded.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Arrival of Wheat Obstructed, No. 2 Flour Mill Steady</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the No. 2 Flour Mill's plate continued to open at 8.5 yuan. Because it had already risen by 10 cents the previous day, it temporarily did not rise again. The asking price for returned goods, Green Artillery, had already reached more than 9 yuan. Banks in Northern China are slightly involved in taking care of it. The factory also has a small number of supplies for the Tianzhu fishermen who are liquidating from Nanyang. The total volume of traded in the market is estimated to be around 40,000 bags, half of which are handled by local merchants. Because the Japanese flour factory is strictly cracking down on the hoarding of rice and grains and working together to eliminate the rice shortage, the future of grain prices seems unlikely to improve, and the market is gradually becoming fatigued. The December opening price of Phoenix Brand continues to hover at 8.178 yuan. Today, 1,000 bags of flour are being shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>The price of wheat rose again yesterday. Recently, due to the obstruction of supply from various places, suppliers' minds have become more demanding. The factories are also eager for raw materials and have repeatedly raised prices to purchase them. The highest price has reached a peak of 15 yuan, as seen by the general public. A total of 35,000 bags were taken away by Fuxin and Fufeng factories in the market to manage Suzhou, Changzhou, and Wuxi, with prices ranging from 15 yuan to 14.89 yuan, which shows the momentum of the rise.</p>
<h3>Cracking Down on Rice and Grain Manipulation: Soybean Oil Weakens</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of strict crackdowns on rice market manipulation, the manipulation in the oil market has also disappeared. Soybean oil has had no market for five days. Peanut oil has fallen by 9 yuan from its highest price, and people's hearts have softened, with the market continuing to decline. However, due to supply interruptions, the decline has not been fierce. Yesterday, high-quality products remained unchanged, and the price of medium-quality products continued to be adjusted by a margin of a fraction of a cent. A total of three trucks of Nanjing beans were opened, with prices ranging from 17.2 yuan to 17.35 yuan. 277 bags of Qingdao Cai Lv beans were priced at 20.5 yuan, 200 bags of Dingjiazhou beans were priced at 18.5 yuan to 18.8 yuan, and 150 bags of Wuhu beans were priced at 18.3 yuan. Exports remained unchanged, with only local demand.</p>
<p>On the 13th, 530 pieces of soybean oil were shipped from Yantai, and 1,140 pieces were loaded from Qingdao. On the 14th, 900 bags of soybeans and 620 pieces of soybean cake were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Securities: Transactional Activity Sluggish</h3>
<p>The unofficial market for securities was trending slightly higher yesterday, with few transactions, and could be described as steady. Customers were absent from the market, with only the floor engaging in self-dealing, with only a slight addition. The change of environment is only rumors and not realized, and all kinds of speculative businesses are in a state of stagnation. As such a recurrence is brewing, the waves will certainly come later, and, as such, in the current environment, it will never be allowed to always calm down. Yesterday, the public bonds that passed through, only Types A and B were slightly firmer, with the rest being flat. However, the overall result has been seen to be slightly better by 5 fen, 1 jiao to 2 jiao and a half. The total number of transactions was still only 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock trading, 100 shares of the Shanghai Cotton and Cloth Exchange were traded, with a price of 40 yuan, 07 jiao, and 5 fen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the stock market in the Public Works Association was still sluggish, and shares of the various executive companies received a little attention. The trend of International Trust shares and Shanghai Bank shares was good. The latter once rose to a high price of 12 yuan, 7 jiao. In the case of Yichang Yarn Mill shares, the company announced that the interim interest would only be one yuan. The price suddenly fell from 27 yuan to 26 yuan, and then returned to 2 jiao. The closing price was 26 yuan and 2 jiao for buying. Although the overnight price of London rubber rose 0.0375 points, rubber shares were restricted by profit-taking and could not be extended. The gains on the previous day have already partially fallen back. Although the volume of transactions was not as high as the highest amount in the morning of the previous two days, the number was also very high. Among them, Zhimo, Rubber Trust, and Kezahua stocks had the largest transactions, and the remaining stocks were also very active.</p>
<p>London, December 12, Electricity: Today, the listing of Chinese foreign debt is generally turning calm again, and only the reorganization loan (British issue) continues to fall by one pound to 34 pounds, and the rest are unchanged.</p>
<p>London, December 12, Electricity: Today, the listing of shares of British-owned Far East companies saw ups and downs. HSBC shares rose and fell by half a pound, and British registered shares fell by half a pound to 82 pounds, and Hong Kong registered shares rose by half a pound to 85 pounds. Kurak and Limp Rubber shares rose by 8 pence to 21 shillings and 3 pence.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Fine Yarn Again Being Hoarded, 20-Count Double Horse Rebounds 7 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had fallen the previous day, rose again yesterday due to the promotion of rising American cotton, but passenger sales were not active. In addition, after the 20-count Double Horse factory opened up a huge amount, the chips in the market were overflowing, resulting in heavy pressure. Therefore, although there was a good situation, it never rose along with it. However, judging from the basis of raw cotton, the yarn market is getting better and better. Households with a more relaxed economy have come to collect 32-count and 42-count fine yarn threads, so the market situation is becoming more and more robust.</p>
<p>Because of the sluggish mood on the previous day, the morning opening price for spot yarn was not very high even though American and Indian cotton were all rising. The opening price for 20-count Double Horse was 725 yuan, rising to 29.5 yuan, about 10 yuan higher than the previous day. Later, it was heard that the exchange rate had strengthened, and the market loosened again, falling by three or four yuan. This price hovered for a long time, and it was calm until the close. It was found that 1,395 packages were traded in half a day, and the market was up 7.5 yuan for 20-count Variable Horse and 5 yuan for Tiannv. Today, 30 pieces of yarn are being shipped to Xiamen. The amount bought by each group is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Peers 1,200 Hong Kong 130</p>
<p>Sichuan 15 Mainland 40</p>
<p>Xiamen 10 Statistics 1,395</p>
<h3>Foreign Cotton Rises Sharply</h3>
<p>Tonghua Lock 170 yuan</p>
<p>The transaction of native cotton is still considered to be weak, because the market of overseas India and the American cotton market is more intense, and the estimated prices are greatly rising, so people's minds have recovered, and at the same time, the factories are also active in procurement, and the price of Tongzhou Flower after noon is 170 yuan. The future of the cotton market is still showing a peak of global situation, and from the source in northern Jiangsu, there are 2,467 packages of Tonghua, 554 packages of Changyingsha, and 1,680 packages of Beisha. The current situation of the spot cotton transaction is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Tonghua 167.00 Peer-to-peer 100 packages</p>
<p>Grass Bag 156.00 Peer-to-peer 167 packages</p>
<p>Tongzhou 165.50, 166.00 Peer-to-peer 200 packages</p>
<p>Also 167.00 Peer-to-peer 200 packages</p>
<p>Coarse Velvet Packing 177.50 Shenxin entered 200 loads</p>
<p>Dazhongji 197.50 Peer-to-peer 250 pieces</p>
<p>Beishi Flower 164.00 Shanghai entered 400 packages</p>
<p>Shajia Yang 159.00 Peer-to-peer 100 packages</p>
<p>Also 154.00 Peer-to-peer 100 packages</p>
<p>Tongzhou 164.50 Peer-to-peer 20 packages</p>
<p>Also 168.50 Peer-to-peer 100 packages</p>
<p>Sanyu Flower 178.00 Peer-to-peer 170 packages</p>
<p>According to other sources, the New York cotton market is very active, which is rarely seen. The sharp rise has already exceeded one hundred pounds, and the market situation was firm due to speculators buying in the early morning yesterday, and then due to enthusiastic purchases from overseas parties and the fierce purchases of the industry, the result was the highest closing price, and it was more than thirty pounds higher than the previous day. Due to the sharp rise in New York, the Indian cotton market also rose sharply by more than twenty rupees, and Egypt rose by two hundred and fifty-six pounds, and Liverpool rose by twenty-five pence.</p>
<p>Because of the recent sharp rise in overseas cotton markets, the Shanghai cotton exchange caused, but the cotton yarn in this port has not been able to rise, so the spot transactions have not been able to start. Some parties want to sell for profit, because they are eager to sell and seek cash, and their selling prices may be more than ten yuan cheaper than the prices set by foreign firms, or one hundred pounds, but they are still lacking in demand. Once the yarn prices rise, the cotton trading can be turned into active trading. The current cotton market is calculated at the factory price of US$7.4375, as follows:</p>
<p>20 branch US Mite Lin 143.60</p>
<p>20 branch also lower grade 239.15</p>
<p>32 branch also 250.80</p>
<p>32 branch also lower grade 144.50</p>
<p>42 branch also 254.35</p>
<p>42 branch also lower grade 206.30</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Does Not Fluctuate Much, Qing Red Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market number of domestic Qingchi sugar rose again by one and a half yuan. The Chao Gang opened the market for 45.5 yuan for Chongti Qing and 44 yuan for Huanggang Qing, totaling more than 200 bags. There were more than 100 bags of cotton red, at 45.5 yuan. Diaqing temporarily held steady and was not exchanged. The Geng Zeng market saw slight fluctuations. The two- or four-coarse white sugar was 57.5 yuan at the local warehouse, new goods were 58.7 yuan to 58 yuan at the foreign warehouse, and old goods were 57.5 yuan to 57.3 yuan. The transshipment goods were 49 yuan. Taikoo Chebai rose by 2 jiao and 3 jiao.

The price of local cotton white and No. 1 ice sugar remained unchanged. (The Zhang red sugar on the previous day was mistakenly recorded as Han red and should be corrected).</p>
<h3>Coal and Ashes: Charcoal Prices Rise Due to Interception - A New Batch of Hongji Coal Arrives</h3>
<p>The charcoal market had previously loosened due to the influx of goods from Haimen, which led to sluggish sales. Unexpectedly, yesterday at the Yangjingbang Wharf, while goods were being loaded, a charcoal boat was suddenly intercepted by a certain party and forced into the Hongkou Fish Market, with the intention of controlling incoming goods. This caused panic and boosted market sentiment, raising the price. Haimen flat-cap charcoal was priced at 7.2 jiao per load, Hukoujiang charcoal was 8.8 jiao, and He charcoal was 4.8 jiao, an increase of 5 jiao compared to the previous day.</p>
<p>Another 2,950 tons of Hongji coal arrived on the GLEN Line by the Wah Lun Shipping Company the day before yesterday, berthed at the Hongxing Wharf in Pudong for unloading. It is reported that once the unloading is completed, the ship will continue to Hongji to load coal to Shanghai. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Fine Yarn Fabrics - British and Japanese Factories in China Ship Large Quantities to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Recently, domestic cloth has experienced a more stable exchange rate, continued increases in foreign cotton prices, and thriving cotton market exports, which have boosted confidence. Fine yarn woven products from Japan, and British and Japanese factories in China, have been sold to Southeast Asia in large quantities, greatly reducing the market supply. The business of various Chinese factories has also become more active. Spring delivery fabric orders have been placed through January and February of next year. Fine yarn goods in the market have risen by about 5 jiao per piece. Both spot and forward trading in the local market are quite active. More than 500 boxes of transactions included fabrics such as poplin, bleached cloth, printed cloth, and satin. Wholesale stores only slightly added small amounts of dark-colored fabrics and velvet. More than 100 pieces of white goods, coarse cloth, and fine cloth were traded in the local market. The market price rose by 1 or 2 jiao. Southeast Asian merchants purchased more than 100 pieces of coarse twill. On the 14th, 45 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Dongbu saw a rising flower price, and the industry's confidence was firm, and the market again trended upward. The morning opening price of 12-pound dragon head fine cloth was 20 yuan and 09 jiao per piece. The back market once jumped to 21 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, and the closing price then softened back to between 21 yuan and 21 yuan and 1 jiao. The fine twill was about 10 yuan. The industry has traded to a value of around 1000 pieces, and the customer sales are still lack of development. The formation is strong, and the mouth Qi on the line disk is pretty tight. The dragon-headed fine bevel May issue had opened a few top bags and the value was 20 yuan and 05 jiao per piece.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Red and Black Dates Rebound</h3>
<p>Recently, black dates have seen smoother sales, and asking prices have tightened. The market price for bulk goods, which had previously opened at 35 to 36 yuan, rose sharply to 40 yuan yesterday, a rebound of 4 to 5 yuan. Line disks have also increased accordingly. The current selling price of Boping date heads is 70 yuan to 65 to 66 yuan, Gaozhuang dates are 52 to 53 yuan to 48 to 49 yuan, and bulk black dates are 40 yuan to 37 to 38 yuan.

<h3>Writing Under the Lamp</h3>
<p>— Qin Lao</p>
<p>I happened to find a passage in the prison correspondence of the female revolutionary Rosa Luxembourg, which was a critique of Galsworthy, which was extremely thorough, but also extremely vicious, and also implicated our familiar Bernard Shaw. The letter was written on February 18, 1917, in the Wronke prison to Sonja, the wife of K.Liebkneeht. The passage goes like this:</p>
<p>...In a novel, I would not pursue tendencies, and I am always first fascinated by the value of art, but this "Companion on Earth" made me go against the norm. The wisdom shown by Galsworthy in this book is too terrible. That would really surprise you. However, Galsworthy himself belongs to the typical characters of Shaw or Wilde, which is the most common typical character in the current British intellectual group: he is the smartest and most refined among many people, but also the most decadent; he faces everything in the world, but observes it with a skeptical or playful attitude. Galsworthy makes the protagonists in his works put on the most serious faces in the world, but those faces are all marked with ingenious mocking marks, which often makes me laugh. But similarly, those protagonists are actually well-educated and elegant people, who never laugh or scold at their surroundings, or rarely laugh or scold, even if they really glimpse the parts that can be laughed or scolded. - A true artist should never oppose the meaning he originally created with a mocking attitude. But, Sonja, please understand me, I am not rejecting the satire of the great style based on this. For example, Gerhart Hauptmann's "The Foolishness of Christ" is the most cruel satire of modern society, and that kind of satire has been written in the style that has been written for centuries. But Hauptmann himself did not show a sneer in his writing. ... Galsworthy is completely the opposite. He uses descriptions filled with the kind of wisdom that he tries to avoid everywhere, so that what I get in the end is only a feeling on the table - the kind of feeling on the table every time a new guest walks into the living room - that is, there is only a cunning language that is about to slip past my ears.</p>
<p>In fact, the passage itself is already full of intense irony. "The feeling on the table" is really an excellent description, and it simply encompasses the effect of all cynical literature.</p>
<h3>On the Road - Labor Corps Diary</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>Leaving Bangjiang City, a group of people groped along the long ancient road, the dark and silent surroundings echoed with the sound of straw sandals touching withered leaves. In the night wind, a sharp chill was sent.</p>
<p>"If we don't reach the foot of Mount Jigong before dawn, this comfort mission will probably have to lie down in the trenches and extend for another day!"</p>
<p>Anxiety was attached to everyone's heart, and I also turned my head from time to time to look at the ancient temple.</p>
<p>Cold grey, it gradually shrunk to look like a grave. A few sparse lights flickered on my memory screen, repeating the words of Vice Officer-in-Chief Ke, "Leaving the ancient city and going thirty miles is Mount Jigong, where fierce bloody battles are currently taking place. Everyone must remember the northeast direction...</p>
<p>So lonely, so desolate, like a desert night, only the cold wind passes through the jungle, only the ancient city like a few faint lights above, pointing our steps, chasing the northeast direction.</p>
<p>Walking, groping, the darkness of the night grew deeper; the fleeing ancient city left only a shadow. In the far distance ahead, a hint of red light was faintly showing, and sporadic gunfire was still fluctuating in the sky. We quickened our pace, and boundless joy, like dew, condensed on our dry, grassy hearts.</p>
<p>"The direction is correct, but why is there only sporadic gunfire? Maybe we haven't walked thirty miles yet?" A comrade questioned. But no one had a correct answer, and just walked silently.</p>
<p>Crossing a shallow trench, a series of rapid commands suddenly came from below the ancient pagoda. Several white lights were focused on the white cloth banner of our comforting team.</p>
<p>"Comfort team!" A warrior exclaimed, running over to salute us. Smiling very politely, he said, "You have worked hard! We just received the order to know that you are coming to comfort us, and we really can't accept it. Our troops have advanced twenty miles and have probably crossed the Xinqiang River. I'm very sorry for not greeting you!"</p>
<p>"Don't be polite, dear soldier! No wonder we only heard sporadic gunfire, so it turns out that you have advanced."</p>
<p>"The sporadic gunfire is just searching for the remnants," he waved his hand again, saying.</p>
<p>"Ha! ... Haha! ..." Laughter shook the night sky. A fiery heart, like a caged bird, soared in the boundless sea of clouds. Looking twenty miles away, a group of people sang joyfully: "Let's flow, let's wash away the stains of the rivers and mountains with our blood! Let's rush, let's annihilate the iron hooves of the invaders with our flesh! ..."</p>
<p>"Stop singing, let's hurry up. If we reach twenty miles away, and the troops move forward again, we will rush again. Keep rushing past. Rush through heavy mountains. The leader clenched his fist and said excitedly.</p>
<p>So we repeated the burden and stepped on the fields. The distant red light on the horizon shone like beckoning to us, and our pace was as fast as angry horses galloping.</p>
<h3>Burning</h3>
<p>— Ai Hua</p>
<p>Evening. In the rustling sound, the coarse maple trees, facing the faint sun, raise their heads towards the sky, exhaling a desolate yet subtly sentimental sigh.</p>
<p>I stand. Around me, it seems like an endless desert: a rider gallops forth, dragging a slanting, faint shadow, and amidst the dust and smoke, hesitates briefly before the bleak setting sun, then whips the horse anew, hoofbeats fading into the boundless desert.</p>
<p>The fields are silent, and suddenly, I feel my heart stir; eagerly bearing a wisp of the setting sun, chasing after the dust of the departing hooves…</p>
<p>But the twilight deepens gradually. Evening mist descends, softly, scattering shadows of weariness upon my heart. Bewildered, I take a few steps, my feet emitting a sigh of longing.</p>
<p>A row of densely growing tribulus plants winds around me. Born within this circle, like a caged beast, who wouldn't want to roar in sorrow? I fear that in the end, one would only be used as a flattering example of "success," appearing as a trapped animal, ultimately mocked. I prefer to indulge in a longing for faraway places, loving the image of a fierce falcon, soaring "once aloft, striking the sky." Its mottled black wings, like a curtain hanging from the heavens, cast a resentful glance upon the heavy evening hues, before flapping its wings furiously and flying straight ahead, leaving behind the intense, tumultuous sound…</p>
<p>Since childhood, in my hometown, such heroic deeds were not uncommon; my eyes and ears were filled with them, causing a surge of aspiration in my youthful heart. Under the lamplight, by the fireside, I listened eagerly to the moving stories from the elders: a cousin, a distant relative, these figures were especially dear to me; due to an innate pride, or perhaps a slight misunderstanding, they suffered ridicule, slander, and the envy of the wealthy gentry; in a fit of anger or determination, they decided their futures, young shoulders shouldering a bundle of belongings, a dozen strings of coins; sailing across the ocean, they departed, further and further away! Gradually, I learned that they were living on a vast land. They married, and had children. For such strong-willed, stubborn, and unyielding men enduring hardships, what did ten or twenty years matter? Old people, from their fading memories, recalled his shadow again, smiling, his proud head never looking back.</p>
<p>If it were necessary to find an explanation for everything, it could only be said that the coastal inhabitants have inherited a spirit of adventure -- but it is not the story of searching for the Golden Fleece; that seems too vulgar and too much like a romance. Nor is it "seeking a noble title ten thousand miles away." One day of glory, and they forget their humble beginnings. How petty is utilitarianism in their hearts; they have a determination even stronger than finding the Golden Fleece, empty-handed, to seek something more precious and more sublime than the Golden Fleece.</p>
<p>How inspiring this should be! Yet today, who would have thought that because of a slight sentiment, it would cast such bitter regret upon me? To call it homesickness is not as fitting as calling it shame! The homeland is shattered, and I cower here, living a wretched existence in the den of foxes and shrine rats. How many times have I "enjoyed a moment of peace" in this pure land? -- In the morning, pushing open the window facing the street, a night of north wind has swept away the yellow leaves between the trees. The sky stretches for ten thousand miles, the sounds of the border rise up all around, what is there to hesitate about? If there still flows in my veins some of the strong, brave, and progressive blood of the coastal people, then I should turn it into an iron will, break free from the cage, and rush again towards the sunlit distance, carrying laughter, carrying joy.</p>
<p>I lift my head, and in the vast autumn sky, I appear even more lonely. But my chest burns like a blazing fire. --</p>
<p>"Having shed the nine-hundred-thousand-mile journey to the Northern Sea, when will I be able to soar freely at the Huabiao pillar?"</p>
<p>I will depart.</p>
<h3>Heaven is High</h3>
<p>— Ai Ding</p>
<p>Never forget,</p>
<p>We are still living Eastern Fourth!</p>
<p>We all have hands,</p>
<p>--Our weapons.</p>
<p>Hands can create everything,</p>
<p>Who can deny it?</p>
<p>Heaven "the Old Man" helps you,</p>
<p>Bringing only sunshine and rain,</p>
<p>The rest is blue clouds passing by…</p>
<p>Since the beginning of mankind,</p>
<p>What has Heaven given us? --</p>
<p>It is just so rigid,</p>
<p>Without a trace of reason.</p>
<p>Use our hands,</p>
<p>Create the heaven and earth of mankind!</p>
<p>Persist!</p>
<p>Light must stick tightly.</p>
<p>Rely on what heaven…</p>
<h3>White Chrysanthemums</h3>
<p>— Bei Qiong</p>
<p>Mother brought back a bunch of white chrysanthemums from the street, and cherished them greatly, arranging them in a vase, murmuring, "These are flowers from a painting..." Who can deny the elegant beauty of white chrysanthemums? They are not as glaringly vibrant as roses, nor as coarse as sunflowers; presented before us is a demure maiden, her innocent purity revealing quiet beauty; at first, you might not perceive her charming fragrance? Yet she possesses the magic of Oliver Goldsmith's Sophia! A waft of subtle fragrance will intoxicate you, as sweet as lying on a mountain rock listening to the murmuring stream, drifting silently to sleep... What a rich endowment, yes, these are flowers from a painting!</p>
<p>Because of these flowers from a painting, I leisurely thought of Fang Xu, a friend from whom I have been separated for a year.</p>
<p>He could paint, especially chrysanthemums and plum blossoms. One day, he rushed in and said:</p>
<p>"I'm preparing to give you a painting of white chrysanthemums that you like."</p>
<p>"Oh, then thank you!"</p>
<p>He took out the painting of white chrysanthemums, its shades of light and dark just right, placed it on the table, and swinging his legs, said:</p>
<p>"This is the last painting you will see from me, or perhaps you will see it again, but..., in short, we will be separated soon."</p>
<p>"Separated?" I couldn't help but be surprised.</p>
<p>Yes, the next morning, Fang Xu left his friends and departed, without regret, his future was infinitely great; we had received two letters afterward, but why haven't we heard from him in the last six months?</p>
<p>These are all memories from the past, perhaps many layers of dust have accumulated on that painting of white chrysanthemums? Who is copying white chrysanthemums this year? Does he still have a smile on his round face?</p>
<p>In the sunlight, the white chrysanthemums appear even more slender and graceful, a dull fly hovers and circles above the flowers...</p>

<h3>Lamenting the Death of Fan, the Friend of Punk</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>As 1939 was drawing to a close, Hollywood was suddenly struck by the unfortunate news that the famous martial arts star Fan, the Friend of Punk, had unexpectedly passed away from a sudden heart attack on the twelfth. Prior to this, we had not heard of Fan's illness, yet the news of his death came so suddenly, so quickly, it was truly unexpected. The death of Fan, the Friend of Punk, is undoubtedly a great loss to the Hollywood film industry. He, along with Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford, once stood shoulder to shoulder, sharing fame and glory. Although he has not produced many works recently, this artist's name is still deeply imprinted on the minds of every movie fan.</p>
<p>Fan, the Friend of Punk, dedicated himself to the stage at the age of seventeen. He experienced many failures in his early years, once even changing careers to engage in business. Later, he returned to the stage, but was still unsuccessful at first, finally achieving fame and transitioning from the stage to the silver screen, going to Hollywood to make films. He unexpectedly rose to fame by acting in martial arts films and comedies, becoming Hollywood's only red star. Subsequently, he organized his own film company, with all productions distributed by United Artists. Even now, he remains one of United Artists' four major figures. After many years in the film industry, he is now a wealthy man in Hollywood. From everything mentioned above, we can see that Fan's success today is no accident. In his early years, he also encountered obstacles everywhere. If his will had not been firm, he would have left the stage long ago, let alone entered the film industry!</p>
<p>However, in recent years, Fan's circumstances have been too bad. Especially in 1936, his beloved wife, Mary Pickford, suddenly filed for divorce, causing a great blow to his heart. After the divorce, in a state of disappointment, he went to England to make films, but without any success. He returned to Hollywood dejectedly, and has not been seen in any works for a long time, seemingly having retired, causing general movie fans to often inadvertently wonder why Fan, the Friend of Punk, has not produced any films for us to watch. Who knew such misfortune would occur? From now on, we will no longer have the opportunity to see new films from Fan, the Friend of Punk.</p>
<h3>"Film Herald" Selects This Year's New King and Queen of Film</h3>
<p>— Fei Yun</p>
<p>According to the September report of the American "Film Herald," the New King and Queen of Film for 1939 have been selected. Last year's King of Film, Tyrone Power, and Queen of Film, Jeanette MacDonald, failed to be re-elected. Although only readers of one newspaper participated in this election, it can still be seen as a glimpse into the beliefs of American movie fans. Here, I will record the male and female film stars listed in the top ten:</p>
<p>(I) King of Film: Clark Gable.</p>
<p>Second: Charles Boyer.</p>
<p>Third: Tyrone Power.</p>
<p>Fourth: Robert Taylor.</p>
<p>Fifth: Don Ameche.</p>
<p>Sixth: Cary Grant.</p>
<p>Seventh: Errol Flynn.</p>
<p>Eighth: Gary Cooper.</p>
<p>Ninth: Spencer Tracy.</p>
<p>Tenth: Nelson Eddy.</p>
<p>(II) Queen of Film: Bette Davis.</p>
<p>Second: Carole Lombard.</p>
<p>Third: Loretta Young.</p>
<p>Fourth: Jeanette MacDonald.</p>
<p>Fifth: Irene Dunne.</p>
<p>Sixth: Ginger Rogers.</p>
<p>Seventh: Barbara Stanwyck.</p>
<p>Eighth: Claudette Colbert.</p>
<p>Ninth: Alice Faye.</p>
<p>Tenth: Joan Crawford.</p>
<p>Clark Gable has always been at the top in elections and box office success for many years, truly worthy of being the King of Film. His wife, Carole Lombard, is ranked second only to the Queen of Film, which is unexpected and can be called the glory of the husband and the nobility of the wife. Bette Davis being selected as the Queen of Film shows how deeply American movie fans love this big-eyed star. Charles Boyer, called the "Mysterious Man," being ranked before Tyrone and Robert, his magic can be said to be great. Don Ameche's inclusion is truly a late bloomer and not easy to achieve.</p>

<h3>Treasure Island Mystery "Charlie Chan at Treasure Island"</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>Following Warner Oland, 20th Century Fox discovered Sidney Toler to continue the role of Charlie Chan. Warner Oland's exaggerated movements and mumbling pronunciation served as the basis for imitating Charlie Chan. This, like the production of general films with Chinese backgrounds, is merely a fantasy – at least he lacks the composure and alertness that a great detective should have. This successor, Sidney Toler, is even more based on Warner Oland's style, and the writers have not created newer themes to compile such stories, the Charlie Chan mystery will lose the power to "stimulate" the audience. In my opinion, it's only a matter of time.</p>
<p>For example, "Treasure Island Mystery" can indeed be said to expose the general cunning of villains, detecting others' secrets in order to extort huge sums of money, but as a detective film, it is obviously different from G-Men. It requires a tight layout and careful handling by the director. Charlie Chan mystery under such mass production has to be painted with a bizarre color.</p>
<p>The director of this film is still conscientious. For example, in the scene where Rodin plays, he grasped the tension and suffocating air that a detective film should have.</p>
<p>Cesar Romero specializes in playing villains, and is very competent in playing the role of Rodin in this film.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Records of Theater Viewing</h3>
<p>— Wei Wo</p>
<p>Guan Dayuan's "Battle of Taiping" has not been frequently performed by actors from the North and South recently. Dayuan's ability to perform with weaponry has always been known as his specialty, and is unanimously recognized. Performing "Battle of Taiping" can be said to be his forte. In the opening scene "Golden Hall," the words "Wearing a purple-gold helmet" in the curtain are slightly low in tone, but the four words "covering the top of the eyebrows" are sung high, earning a full house of applause; the singing becomes more lively in the following scattered rhythm, and the tone is increased, making it even more pleasant to hear. In the opening fight scene, the spear techniques are skillful and the movements are agile. When captured, the "playing drums" skill he uses (according to what seems like a spear back, but not a spear back, like a tiger jump, but not a tiger jump, in the lingo of the opera world is called "playing drums") is clean and neat, the flag on his back does not move at all, which cannot be done without real skill. Starting with the lament "A hero's aspirations lost in the net" in Xipi Daoban, the tone rises to Yiyu, and the voice enters a better state. When seeing Chen Youliang, the line "Standing in battle is your master, Hua Yun," the "is" character in "standing in battle is" is sung in a sad tone, and the three characters "Jiang Hua Yun" are sung high, which is in line with the tune. The melody used in these three characters has an endless aftertaste, which is also an old routine, but the voice cannot be competent without a foundation, so those who perform "Battle of Taiping" nowadays have mostly abandoned this melody. It is said that the expressions when beheading the little prince are also good, and the "hair flip" and "staggered steps" all show skill. The duet with Chen Youliang in the execution ground is also extremely tight. In short, Dayuan's performance of this play is really just right. When it comes to today's old students, everyone regards Fu Yinglian and Liang as the best in this field. In fact, Dayuan's artistry is not inferior to Tan and Ma, and his qualifications and experience are more than Tan and Ma. Just look at today's male students who can perform with weaponry, how many are there?</p>
<p>The main play was Zheng Bingru's "Spring Boudoir," Bingru has a good figure, height and appearance, similar to "Progressive Kun Female" Jin Suqin, her voice is very powerful, and her singing and recitation are quite pleasant to hear, but her body still needs research. This is due to insufficient experience, but given time, she may not be an improvable talent. The young male Zhang Lianchang failed to escape mediocrity, and was just average.</p>
<h3>Paramount Grand Event Celebrating the Third Anniversary</h3>
<p>Paramount Ballroom on Jing'an Temple Road is one of the most elegant and luxurious ballrooms in Shanghai, with a well-known reputation and prosperous business. Recently, the band has been replaced, led by the drum king Nelson, all of whom are famous musicians, adding to the elegance and promising to enhance the atmosphere. This month's 16th is the date of the ballroom's third anniversary, and a grand event will be held to celebrate it. It is said that the program is very exciting, and well-known Chinese and foreign song and dance troupes have been recruited early. Warner Bros. Pictures will also screen several valuable short films in the hall that evening to entertain the guests. The hall has also prepared a large number of commemorative items to be distributed to dancers. It is expected that there will be clouds of guests at that time, and the lively situation will be rare in the isolated island in recent years. Detailed programs will be revealed in the Shen and Xin newspapers that day.</p>

<h3>Outside the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Several Banker Supporting Actors</p>
<p>Bankers hold the power of finance, and all undertakings in society must rely on their advocacy and support to succeed, and the theatrical undertaking is of course no exception. Let us look at the already famous Dr. Mei Lanfang. If Mr. Feng Gengguang of the Bank of China had not sponsored and promoted him, and sponsored his performance abroad to promote the national opera, Mei would not have been able to enjoy the honors of Doctor, King, and so on. Looking again at Shang Xiaoyun and Cheng Yanqiu, one is the adopted son of Wu Yulin, the Minister of Finance of the warlord government, and the other is a good friend of Chairman Li Shizeng of the Board of Directors of the Sino-French Gengkuan. A minister and a chairman are far wealthier than a few bankers, so Shang and Cheng are also listed among the four famous female roles. The leading figures in the banking industry are of course well-off and generous in their actions. If they want to support a certain actor, as long as they make a phone call to a certain theater to order a few rows of seats or a few boxes, the theater owner will naturally reserve the best seats. Even the staff serving in the bank can carry the banner of a certain bank, or the banner of their general manager, director, president, etc., and often go to various theaters or the private residences of actors, and they can also receive the welcome and warm hospitality of others. Because in this society, this is the current trend. Nine out of ten people are all worshippers of money, so bankers are welcomed everywhere, for fear of not making friends with them. (160)</p>
