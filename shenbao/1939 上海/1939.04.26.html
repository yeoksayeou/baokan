<h3 id="c6">英國之徵兵制問題與國際 <a href="#c6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>他國之內政問題，在彼國內方朝野參商、爭持未決、乃我人從旁發為贊成或反對之主張、甚無聊也。顧今日請略一論及英國徵兵之實施問題。事非無聊，所關至大。</p>
<p>英國夙採傭兵制，嗣以適應環境之需要而兼取「國民志願服務制」；最近則兼程並進於「國民義務服務制」，「國民軍訓」，「徵兵制」，以及他種變態徵兵法之鼓吹與運動。由漸而入，將近成熟，於是觸及實施問題。鼓吹與運動之尖銳　數月，至昨日而為閣議中主要之談話資料；尚未正式討論，當然無所決定。攷問題之分野，內閣之中，多數閣員主張確立徵兵制實施之原則，然原則之下，不盡同其方案；並有一部份黨主政，徵兵制為達反英國傳統思想傳統方式之新辦法，今鼓吹運動而主張實施新辦法者為夙傳正統之保守黨當局，而比較前進之在野黨則反對之；演為顛倒之奇觀，近乎反串之喜劇，縱各有其論據，然彼英倫政事，不必論也。</p>
<p>茲請論之者，問題在英國，影響在國際。世事如抽　，如剝蕉，愈抽愈執剝愈深入而愈露本相。申言之：世界之混亂，原因原甚複雜，然與英國實力之落伍，頗有關係；世界之安定，有待多方努力，然英國而能急起直追，必為安定之重要因素。故以混亂歸咎英國，安定歸功於英國，皆屬過甚之辭，然關聯之密切重大，則其問自有不磨之消息焉。義大利先後滅亡阿比西尼亞與職阿爾巴尼亞，曾流小量之血；夫滅人國而血流僅此，比例上遠不如宰雞宰牛，所耗之多，是代價之不足掛齒者。德意志先後兼併奧地利與捷克斯拉夫兩國，尤未流滴血。語曰知己知彼，百戰百勝；彼被滅亡，遭兼併之四國，誠為德義所深知，故一舉而攫之；顧英國非以歐洲盟主自居者　？在國聯，儼然盟主也；十數年來扶德扶義，儼然盟主也；匝月來，予波蘭以保障，予羅馬尼亞保障，志在予東歐以及巴爾幹半島一切國家以保障，又儼然盟主也；德義何敢拂逆盟主而放肆恣為乎？是無他，流小量血乃至不流血如德義者，居然使世人談虎變色而諡之曰　武國家者，徒以英國休休有容之為不武盟主而已。知己知彼，德義亦知英國者也。</p>
<p>英國對德義，歷來掉以輕心，曰我多金鎊而彼窮，而不知金鎊不能直接用以應付德義飛機之空襲，以保障金鎊之安全。及以金鎊充實空防，始得稍稍恢復盟主之面目。然德義羽毛漸豐，勢如燎原；英國雖擁有絕對優勢之海軍，急起直追而有勢均力敵之空軍；遑論全面戰爭之決勝關鍵，非更有大量陸軍不可；即使不戰，在外交上非有大量陸軍，即無以取信強健之友邦而取得盟國，亦無以告慰弱小之友邦而克勝保障。數日之前，法國對於英國之不能毅然改進其現行之陸軍制度而表示疑訝；此類疑訝之表示，在外交上實有深長意味。英國與蘇俄談判已久，迄未告成，外傳癥結，不盡可信；然以英國陸軍力量之薄弱，不足為蘇俄盟國，亦為可能之理由。東歐與巴爾幹半島諸國孰不忌憚德義侵略之凶鋒，宜無不傾心於其他強國之善意保障，然奔走於倫敦巴黎間者，亦僕僕於柏林羅馬道上；夫何以故，謂非恐英國雖允保障，然薄弱之陸軍力量竟無能為力耶？即使法蘇兩國以及東歐與巴爾幹半島諸國，無所不慊於英國之小陸軍；在彼德義兩國，自外交上演說上，雖具見英國自相張伯倫氏之老而彌壯，發奮為雄，然證以英國陸軍制度之安於現狀，長此渺少，亦可覘知英國內部矛盾之深刻，初無挺身而出，抵抗侵略之決心。</p>
<p>總而言之：在任何國家變更傭兵制而實施徵兵制，乃為擴展陸軍之技術問題，制度問題，不必申論。英國徵兵制之實施與否，可以觀察今後英國陸軍力量者，其一；觀察英國有無預聞歐陸決心者。其二；觀察英國安定歐陸時局，有效與否者，其三；觀察反侵略集團之組織，成立與不，強弱如何者，其四；觀察侵略國家是否忌憚反侵略集團者，其五。惟此五者，英國徵兵制之實施問題，固未可視為英國之內政問題；誠使徵兵制立即實施，而英蘇盟約隨之告成，則所關尤巨矣。</p>

<p>宣傳之任務（續昨）</p>
<p>戰地宣傳工作之任務與對象　　根據部長在關於政治部今後工作之討論與決議中的指示歸納起來、戰地政治宣傳工作的任務、在於（甲）發動與擴大遊擊戰、（乙）建立與鞏固我們的革命政權、（丙）更堅強的組織敵後民眾與敵人爭民眾、（丁）清除漢奸、毀滅偽組織、瓦解偽軍、搖動敵軍、（戊）破壞故人之交通、阻撓敵人政治經濟文化之一切設施、務使敵人疲於奔命、為我廣大的革命勢力所包圍打擊、以至於崩潰、</p>
<p>因此戰地政治宣傳工作的對象、主要的可分為下列四種、（甲）正式部隊的官兵和遊擊隊員、（乙）敵後的民眾、（丙）敵偽的官兵、（丁）俘虜、最高領袖在高級政工會議訓詞中、曾剴切的指示、政治工作的涵義及其教育的範圍說、「政治工作者、乃軍隊與民眾間之政治教育、使其明瞭政治實行政策、」又說「教育範圍不僅限於部隊及其屬員、而係凡為軍隊所駐地方、共四週環境皆以軍隊為模范、發生教育民眾的功用、」在部隊政治宣傳工作、自然首先以部隊的官兵為對象、必須幫助部隊的訓練、提高紀律、提高士氣扶救傷病、防止逃亡、第二入伍當兵、退伍為民、兵民本屬一體、而在敵後作戰、尤須獲得民眾的支持和擁獲、領袖訓示指明、軍隊必須成為民從的模範、「發生教育民眾的功用、」同時部長指示「軍民合作實為我戰勝敵人之唯一要素、在敵人後方、我尤須與敵人爭民眾、故部隊紀律、又實為抗戰之最高要求、」故對於故後民眾的政治宣傳工作、尤須部隊的政工人員切實負責、最好做到每一士兵都能成為民眾的宣傳者與教育者第三戰地為敵人後方與敵人接觸頻繁、不特在作戰上感到有「清除漢奸、毀滅偽組織、瓦解偽軍、搖動敵軍」的迫切需要、而且在宣傳技術上也有使我們對敵偽的宣傳深入與擴大的便利、故敵偽的官兵也為戰地政治宣傳工作的重要對象、至於俘虜的宣傳教育工作、如果做得好、對於我們的對敵宣傳、尤有很大的幫助、</p>
<p>宣傳之要點</p>
<p>寅　戰地宣傳要點　共通的宣傳要點、宣傳的內容與方式、雖不能不隨其對象之不同而有所差異、但同時也有其共通的地方、茲為避免敘述的重複起見、把兩種對象以上的共通要點條例如次、</p>
<p>甲（主要是對象部隊與民眾）（一）根據六十年來日寇侵華的史實證明日本帝國主義是中華民族唯一敵人、使敵後軍民明瞭敵我勢不兩立、只有驅逐日寇出中國、我們才能過太平的日子、（二）宣揚總理遺教、闡發三民主義、使敵後軍民明瞭實行三民主義為完成抗戰建國最正確的途徑、（三）第三屆國民參政會一致通過、請政府通令全國軍民、服　蔣委員長在去年十二月二十六日宣言（按即駁斥近衛狂妾聲明之訓示）中所宣示之大義、堅其信心、齊其步伐、一心一德、澈始澈終、以復我主權與行政之完整、而完成抗戰之大業、對於敵後軍民尤須使之深切理解、（四）同時、務須從理論與事實上多方證明、最高領袖上述訓詞所指示之要點、使敵後軍民明瞭日閥所持的政策、根本與我民族國家的生存獨立及東亞秩序世界和平不相容、深切了解我們抗戰建國的國策、明瞭敵人所藉口的各種欺騙宣傳、（五）根據最高領袖歷次關於抗戰建國的宣言和決議、於抗戰的言論與指示、闡明我國之抗戰、不僅是爭取民族的生存、國家的獨立、同時也為了保障東亞與世界的和平、（關於此點也應向敵軍官兵宣傳）、（六）宣揚中央政府根據搞戰建國國策對於全國政治經濟文化等之重要設施、以及政府對於敵後軍民之眷念與期望、使敵後軍民明瞭我國各方面的進步、及中央政府對於他們的德意、（七）宣傳我國上下、精誠團結、各戰場我軍的勝利、前線將士的英勇作戰、各地壯丁大批請求入伍、（如永安縣大足縣等）、各地民眾及海外僑胞的踴躍獻金、積極參加抗戰工作等事實和消息、以揭穿敵寇的謠言、鼓勵敵後軍民抗戰的熱情、尤堅強其抗戰必勝的信心、（八）宣傳敵情、尤其是關於日寇國內政治的不安、產業的凋敝、財政的竭蹶、生活的困難、反戰的情緒高漲、敵軍士兵的厭戰自殺及反戰華變（如大沽·江陰·廣州·漢口等敵軍　變事件、如大阪火藥庫的爆發等等、）以及偽軍不斷的反正事例、使敵後軍民瞭然於日寇潰敗為不可避免的理勢、（九）宣傳國際形勢、於我有利、於敵不利的趨勢和消息、（如最近英·美·法·蘇各大民主國家、日趨接近、英美法三國以同樣的通牒、否認日寇所謂「東亞新秩序」、主張九國公約有效、英美對我國的信用借款、國聯重申譴日援華的決議、以及各國人民之切實抵制日貨、援助中國國際反侵略運動代表大會通過援助中國等等事實、）使敵後軍民明白敵人日益孤立、我國國際地位日益提高、並深切了解我越堅持抗戰、越能領導國際形勢、同趨於反侵略之一途、（未完）</p>

<p>當華軍某部生力軍開始向蘇魯邊境移動時、日軍感受威脅、亦由膠東增兵南犯、企圖先發制人、但華方各軍、久經戰陣、在魯南一帶佈置堅强之防禦工事、同時並以游擊兵力相輔進行、故兩軍甫經接觸、日軍即被各個擊破、由張　雲統率之日僞軍兩千餘名、初由諸城西犯、在枳溝一帶、被華軍晝戰夜襲、打得落花流水、日僞軍死傷約百餘名、華軍並生擒日僞官兵四五十名、獲騾馬數十匹、及步兵砲及槍枝彈藥極夥、日僞軍殘餘、狼突豕奔、逃回諸城、華軍乘勝追擊、刻己將諸城包圍、準備聚而殲之、安邱方面、日軍增兵南犯、在臨悟石埠沈劉莊一帶、亦遭遇華軍大隊迎頭痛擊、激戰半日之久、斃日軍極衆、遺屍遍野日軍軍勢頹靡、不支竄退、五日、日軍又增援步兵砲兵二三百名、以汽車八輛掩護反攻、經華軍迎戰側擊、又遭遇重挫、乃於富晚潰退臨胸、南犯之日軍亦向蔣峪進攻、被華軍猛烈痛擊、日軍雖續增援兵、又犯大關、華軍乃再出奇兵、三面夾擊、激戰至烈、華軍前仆後繼、肉搏血戰、日軍不支、始全綫崩潰、遺屍纍纍、華軍所獲軍用品、無法統計、至臨郯之日軍、亦向南移、與華軍勁旅遭遇、受挫慘重、不得南犯、刻已被華方大軍監視包圍、行將殲滅、刻在魯南之華軍、分據各重要軍略地區、並防守各山嶺公路、兼之魯南民風强悍、紅槍會與人民抗日自衛團、遍地皆是、山東省政府主席沈鴻烈、亦將魯南八縣政權、分別建樹、專員縣長、均努力發動民衆、配合正規軍、參加抗戰工作、故該區戰績、已漸恢復去歲魯南大會戰之光榮續頁、</p>
<p>淮北戰况</p>
<p>自上月底華軍某部勁旅開入淮北、即策應各縣常備隊與人民自衛團、與日僞不斷激戰、尤以在漣水境之灰樹　·高溝·湯溝·一帶、與日僞遭遇激戰最烈、會將頑敵擊斃極衆、旋掩護民衆破壞淮海·鄭海·淮徐·各公路、使日軍重兵器、無法行駛、同時邳縣縣長王化雲、率常備隊·自衛隊·兩度收復邳縣縣城、斃日僞二三十名、俘虜多名、奪獲長短槍數十枝、及其他各極軍實馬匹、泗陽縣長王殿華、督率常備隊·及自衛團、並有組織之武裝民衆數千名、先後在洪澤湖北岸史家莊·莊家灘·陸家嘴一帶、與日僞激戰多次、利用湖沼地帶、展開游擊戰術、日僞重兵器、無法活動、顧此失彼、聯絡迭被截斷、故日僞傷亡特重、並斃日軍隊長鈴木三郎、奪獲毒氣砲一門、其他各種軍用器材尤多、殘餘日僞軍、卒退回泗陽、不敢再出、刻王縣長巳將部隊重加調整、並呈准將各武裝民衆收編爲正規軍、抗戰武力、益加充實、最近巳向泗陽反攻、逼近城郊、宿遷縣長魯同軒、亦與王縣長取得密切聯絡、督率所部反攻宿遷、並將宿泗·宿沭·宿睢·各縣公路、悉予破壞、使日僞無法取得聯絡、贛榆縣長朱愛周、亦已將所部縣常備隊、整理就緒、並與魯南大軍取得連擊、亦正向日僞開始游擊、</p>
<p>進攻兩淮</p>
<p>華軍進攻兩淮部隊、自月初開始運動後、已到達淮屬附郊、淮陰城內、常駐日僞軍五六百名至千名、時常調換、淮安日軍約五六百名、該城輸廓廣大、城垣甚高、日軍在各門架設大砲及機槍、防守頗嚴、華軍於初次進攻、會逼近淮陰西門附近、並以雲梯爬城、日軍利用其猛烈砲火、强施壓迫、未得衝入、迨後華軍克復淮安淮陰間之板閘、將公路破壞、並將日軍聯絡、予以切斷、兩淮之日軍死守孤城、不敢外出、華軍嗣又進攻數次、日軍憑　負隅頑抗、華軍乃以砲火轟城、並將電燈廠炸毀、日軍仍死守不敢出戰、華軍乃將淮屬四週公路、遂段切斷、使其無法通行重武器、而不得應援、淮陰方面、亦在華軍嚴密監視下、華軍在城郊四週、公開活動、而日軍不敢出城一步、</p>
<p>收復海門</p>
<p>南通海門一帶各部隊、自本週開始總反攻後、西起季家市、東至啟東縣境之靑龍港、全綫於十二日同時發動、官兵奮勇、士氣極旺、與日軍激戰僅一二盡夜、即相繼收複姜灶港·八廠·青龍港·張芝鎭、並將大生紗廠之日軍、全部殲滅、該廠機器、亦即破壞、免再資敵、當時日軍一般退據縣城東北角之海門中學、一股退守海門市內、（該縣無城）華軍於十四·十五·十六·三日、連夜進攻、反復動殺、本月十六日將海門縣治正式收復、殘餘日軍、狼狽奔竄、華軍計斃敵二百餘名、生擒三四十名、俘獲軍用物品、堆積如山、同日、又克複灰堤壢、（在南通南門外）當華軍秦捷電訊傅到各綫、軍心益感振奮、向日軍反攻、前仆後繼、愈加猛烈、大有破竹之勢、至如臯方面、華軍反攻、先後收複石莊鎭·新生港·碾砣港　·（均在如臯城南）各重要據點、日軍傷亡慘重、遺屍遍野、刻如臯縣城亦在華軍包圍之中，他如運河綫以入揚邵一帶之日軍、均不時被華軍襲擊、形同驚弓之鳥、華軍各綫陣地、益加穩固、總這、蘇北戰局、最近已轉入劇時代之新階段也、</p>

<h3 id="c69">愛情是美滿生活的要素 <a href="#c69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>在我們的生活裹，理智常然是很寶責的。一個小孩子因為沒有理智，才做出了許多不良的事情，負有敎養責任的他的父母，只要設法來會長他的理智，不良的行為，就會減少的。不過，一個成人，除了需要理智之外，他還需要着愛情，要是過於理智了，他將成為一個冷酷者，人家遇着他，硬生生地，將難免性情怪僻之譏！這種人固然缺乏些情感，然而對於愛仍是一樣的需要。因為愛情足以滋潤他，鼓勵他，使他生活的內容美化而圓滿。所以西洋人說：「一個美滿的生活，必須要有理智來領導着，愛情來鼓勵着。」這是一點也不差的。</p>
<p>我們只要看一個失戀的男子，他將感覺着如何的心灰意冷，生活的枯燥寂寞，簡直是百無聊賴，有時竟因此而致自殺！誠然，愛情實是我們生活中所不可少的要素，缺了愛情，就無以為美滿的生活，靑年男女，所以視愛情為第二生命，也就是這個道理。不過，愛情並不是稀世之寶，乃是家常便飯。一個精力充沛的健壯男子，一旦娶了一個健美多姿的女郎，他們必然情深似海，樂勝于飛，生育着伶俐的子女，組織着快樂的家庭，這不是很平常的嗎？一個堂堂的鬚眉男子，何以要給女性所拋棄而陷於失戀慘境？其問雖有原因多端，但多半必為男子於早年犯有自凟與遺精或婚後的荒淫縱慾與憂勞斵傷之故。在天賦機能上爆發着滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精薄不育，神經衰弱等症，則旣面黃肌瘦，體貌不揚引不起女性的愛戀。即在夫婦生活上，亦必不能圓滿，為妻憎恨，雖過去的愛情也要毀於一旦，因此在家庭間每演出了種種的悲劇，那末，他的生活，將更如何悽慘呢！</p>
<p>聰明丈夫欲謀補救，必須根本治愈其疾病。治療之法，據世界名醫及余經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』最為對症特效。因此劑於服後一日夜間即可生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，必可於短期內治愈上述各症，幷可收延年益壽返老還童之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服『希米脫氏固精片』，以固精關，制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效允速。患者如能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射，手術等各種科學療法，更可保證治愈。</p>
<h3 id="c70">遺精自凟不啻自絕生機 <a href="#c70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>處在豐當性的誘惑的都市裏，血氣方剛的靑年誰能不為之心動呢？花柳病毒的恐怖，使他沒有宿娼的勇氣，可是性的苦悶難當，只得定上手淫一途，說起來也是多麼的可憐！但手淫一犯，極易養成惡習而放縱，久而久之，精關弛鬆，有時做着風流美夢而致遺精，也有不知不覺間，或見了女色，或局部偶與衣袴接觸，即興淫念，而有精液遺出者。日復一日，生命的源泉儘向外流，你的血肉之軀怎能不弄得精枯血竭，百病叢生。因此，凡腦力衰弱，失眠健忘，頭腦脹痛，志氣消沉，思想困難，腰酸背痛，腎虧無能，精力渙散等症象更相繼而來，此種靑年，不特因多病多痛，學術與事業無成，終生潦倒，就是在人生所不可少的夫婦生活上，亦必不能圓滿，為要憎恨，演出了家庭間的種種悲劇，或子女無出，貽終生大憾！其他因生機枯竭，形成米老先衰，早年殀殤者，亦是甚多的事！</p>
<p>遺精的特效療法。此時只有服「希米脫氏固精片」，最為可靠，因此劑於服後，即可鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，遺精自可痊愈，若因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，能繼續服用，上述各症，亦可早日痊愈，患有如能親來本診所施用電療注射手術等各種科學療法，更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3 id="c71">乳峯是角勝情塲的重要利器 <a href="#c71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>春風吹隴畝。蛺碟對對飛，當此天氣漸漸暖了起來的今日，誰願意再披上笨重而可憎的棉衣，所以每個人—尤其是綺玉年華的少女，在薄薄輕衫軟軟風中，益顯着她們的活躍和健美，誠然，一個豐姿綽約，血液充盈，在胸前聳起了靈動的雙峰，左右並峙，面部浮起了桃花迎人的一般微笑，身段是苗條的，曲線的，娉娉婷婷，這不是與美麗的春景相媲美，窈窕多姿而動人？這種女性，因為乳峯發育的佳良，所以卵巢機能必然健全，絕無隱病，不但在交際塲中，為情人愛之若天仙，即於婚後亦無不被丈夫視如珍實，愛情彌篤，組織着快樂的家庭，生育着伶俐的子女，這是多麼幸福而可喜？！</p>
<p>可是話得說回來，女性如因早年束胸，自凟，白帶，貧血，月經不調，重症侵害以致卵巢機能遭受摧殘，影晌新陳代謝作用，致乳峯萎　，慷美喪失者，則雖在此艷陽天氣，薄薄輕衫之下，更覺『圖窮匕見』醜態愈加顯露，結果，在情塲里噹到失戀痛苦，在結婚後亦每被丈夫視同敝屣，幸福毫無！唯一補救辦法；據世界婦科名醫及余經騐，祇有服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』最為時症而特效。蓋此劑係由少壯動物的卵巢精質製成，故服後一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經暖宮止帶，如繼績服用，担保能於短期內使乳峯高聳，面頰紅潤，增進健美。</p>

<p>急性白濁，因患者之痛苦不堪，而且是初次遇見，更不知所措。實際上此種急性淋，並不如病家痛苦時所感到的危險。不但並非危險之症候，而且實是容易治療之症候，患者之意識，實處以鎭静，並急速請富有經騐，設備完全而肯負責之醫家治療，庶幾可以在七八天內根本治愈。急性白濁最大之難題，是在醫家之能否負責。爲病家作澈底治療，及病家能否攝生及擯棄不良之劣藥而已。如能慎重於擇醫及攝生，實爲病家最易解脱淋毒之痛苦，病家千萬注意！。</p>
<p>患者每於不潔性交之後第三四日間，發生病象。身發三十七八度之體温，龜頭腫大包皮翻轉，膿血交作，排尿異常困難等症。余對於急性白濁之治療，首採用特製菌苗及最超特的化學療法，同時並用德國濾淋平流電療法，並用冷却法等，使體內發生一種抗毒作用，迅速撲滅如火如荼之淋菌，及制止炎症之熾烈，故可以當天止痛，三天淸濁消炎，一星期可以完全治愈。歷試不爽，歐西各國專家，近來對於此等療法頗饒興趣，採用者日多，凡各著名花柳病院，均一致採用。良由其成績優越，治愈急性淋占百分之九十以上云</p>

<p>日艦自封鎖我沿海各地後、阻撓各國外輪行駛、任意檢查、非法扣留外輪、企圖獨覇沿海航業、雖經關係各國領事之交涉無效、今對浙閩粵以及蘇北我軍防地之各口岸、竟籍口有軍事行動、不許外輪行駛、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>日本護充在華航業</p>
<p>日本竭力擴充在華船業、排擠外商、企圖獨覇、日商在清公司除開航滬青·滬連·滬津等航線外、新闢上海·廈門·航線、並擴張內地航線、如小海崇明線、上海天生港線、上海新港線、日商大連汽船會社、專航上海·青島·大連·天津·等航線、日商大阪商船會社、專航上海·廈門·基隆·等航線、日本郵船會社專航長崎·神戶·以及歐洲各地航線、此外所謂之上海內河汽船公司、專航江浙兩省淪陷區域之內河航線</p>
<p>檢查扣留外商船隻</p>
<p>外商行駛中國各口岸之船隻、為日方無理檢查者、不勝枚舉、至於藉口國藉不明、被扣留迄示釋放者、（一）葡商棠貝·棠喬·棠魯·美達·海龍·利賓·大德·魯德·賓德·福祿·康伯·天馬·瑪麗·等輪、（二）希商亞生·利物多·四巴度、（三）匈商愛大、（四）巴商赤坎、（五）挪商公共·塞維克、以上被扣商輪、共達二十艘之多、現或泊在滬、或泊在臺、均由日方派兵監視、各輪均已失去自由、</p>
<p>藉口軍事阻撓航行</p>
<p>中國駐軍之沿海各口岸、為浙之寧波·海門·溫州、閩之福州·興化·泉州、粵之汕頭、蘇北之阜寧、以及遊擊隊控制區域、如啟東海門各港口、今日艦在該口外洋面、任意檢查外輪出入、並籍口有軍事行動、阻撓外輪行駛以上各岸、例如意商義華洋行之賓利輪、被阻在溫州口外、北沙線德耀各輪、暫停行駛啟東海門、永貞等輪、被迫停駛蘇北阜寧航線、南通天生港線、為日商獨佔航行、</p>
<p>英商維持在華航線</p>
<p>英商太古·怡和·各公司所有船隻、向以行駛中國沿海南北洋線及長江航線為主、今受日主之阻撓、以致船業大受影響、惟為維持在華原有航線起見、決定不惜任何犧牲、所有各線、仍派輪行駛、如怡和之義和輪、雖接到日艦之通知、不許駛往北沙、但該輪依然開航、必要時決請英艦保護、此外如滬津線·滬浙線·滬閩線·滬汕線仍按期派輪行駛、現因旅客貨物銳減、及日方阻撓而停航、</p>
<p>各國航業極度衰落</p>
<p>各國在華之航業、受日排擠影響、極度衰落、各國政府對此、頗為重視、新聲社記者昨向海關探悉、今年一月至上月之船隻出入各關比較、日本已跳登第一位、記九八一隻、一·五九二·〇三八噸、英國反降至第二位、計五六三隻、一·五五三·七一〇噸、瑙威船第三位、一五一隻、三一〇·七三八噸、德船第四位、五四隻、二六八·四三三噸、和船第五位、四二隻、一八五·三三六噸、美船第六位、二〇隻、一一六·八四一噸、</p>

<p>溫州之甌江口、自經溫臺防守司令部於二十三日起命令禁阻通航後、原駛該線之各外輪、現均暫泊上海、並電溫探詢情形、但浙東局勢、仍極緊張、甌江恢復通航、一時尚無希望、留甬之恩德輪、於駛甬途中、曾遭日艦檢查、該輪已改今日駛滬、寧波情形、迄仍安謐、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>各輪暫停電詢真相</p>
<p>自日艦日機於二十二日起、在溫州甌江肆行騷擾後、浙東形勢、驟趨緊張、華軍當局、為加強防務、業於二十三日起、由溫臺防守司部命令禁止航輪出入甌江、宣告封鎖交通、留溫之英輪海陽·穎州·德商謀福·等三輪、均經駛離甌江、分駛港滬、駛溫之　商德平·德商海福·哈納·等輪、亦經先後折回、被阻於烏裏洋面之義商寶利輪、亦經於昨晨到滬、現各輪均停泊十六鋪羅斯福碼頭、所裝貨物、暫不起卸、以便局勢稍松、仍行駛溫、昨日中意輪船公司並電溫州、探詢真相、但迄晚尚未獲電覆、故各輪均暫時停航、在未獲確切消息之前、不擬改駛他線、</p>
<p>局勢仍緊復航困難</p>
<p>現代社記者、昨向航業界探悉、本市德商禮和洋行海福輪辦事處、昨接溫州電告、謂前日（二十四日）日艦再度炮轟黃華關要塞、駐軍即予還擊、同時有日機飛城區、投下燒夷彈、至詳細情形、則電文簡略、未有述及、並稱浙東形勢、仍極緊張、甌江之封鎖未堵塞、但恢復通航、一時恐尚無希望、又悉第十集團軍總司令暨浙省黃主席、業已命令駐防部隊、嚴密戒備、日如進犯、決予迎頭痛擊、</p>
<p>哈納請求復航滬定</p>
<p>浙東通航口岸之定海椒江·甬江·甌江·等、自先後封鎖後、滬浙交通、業已完全斷絕、定海同鄉方面、以原籍食糧缺乏、民食堪虞、故經要求恢復滬定航運、以資接濟、同時德商遠東輪船公司、亦經向寧波防守司令部請求准予派哈納輪行駛滬定線、以維交通、茲據公司方面消息、該項請求、尚在靜候核示中、外傳該輪將於明後日即行駛定說、係屬不確、</p>
<p>恩德電告今日駛滬</p>
<p>中意輪船公司之恩德輪、自裝麥駛甬後、原定昨日由甬啟椗返滬、公司昨接該輪電告、謂寧波情形安謐、恩德因裝貨不及、已改於二十六日下午四時啟椗、逕返上海、將於明晨抵埠、並悉該輪於由滬駛甬途中、在鎮海口外、龍山縣屬洋面、曾遭日艦阻止行駛、當由日軍官一人、偕臺籍譯員登輪檢查、並指該輪係屬華商、擬加扣留、經意籍大副白色利接見、說明該輪已讓與意商、領有意國證書、日兵無奈、糾緾兩小時後、始行退去、該輪乃即駛入甬江、</p>
<p>滬浙郵匯</p>
<p>照常收寄</p>
<p>又另據現代社記者向郵政管理局方面探悉、自甌江於日前封航後、關於滬浙間郵件匯兌、除大宗包裹及印刷品等重量郵件、因運輸不便、暫停收寄外、其餘如平信·快信·掛號信·匯兌等、因事關郵運、郵局方面、仍竭力維持、照常收遞、以便利民眾、惟郵路因浙東航運不通、故暫時將改道福州轉遞、雖時日方面、稍形延遲、但決不使其中斷、</p>

<p>工部局公用事業委員會及董事會、曾於最近考慮中國公共汽車公司及電車公司所繳哩　費是否適當、良以現在築路材料購價、已高漲一倍以上、公共汽車之重量及容積、均見增加、觀乎此等事實、從前所訂之哩程費表、顯已失當、該表所開數額如下、</p>
<p>前訂費額　裝有氣胎之英裏慶繳銀一分五厘、約合國幣二分零九毫、裝有硬輪之無軌電車、每英裏應繳國幣二分、裝有氣胎之無軌電車、每英裏應繳國幣一分七厘、此外電車公司應自無軌電車之總收入中、提出百分一·二五、繳付工部局、作為　這許營業費、</p>

<p>虞洽卿先生</p>
<p>— 周</p>
<p>服務社會的精神　生平服膺忠信勤儉四字　數十年奮鬥為中外折服　舊聞新抄均上海之掌故</p>
<p>虞洽卿先生以古稀晋三之高齡，服務社會，久而彌篤，其事業，其德行，早爲中外人士所欽景。記者昨往訪問，在佈置簡潔之會客室中，與虞氏作長時間之談話，氏情緒熱烈，娓娓不倦，共態度之誠摯，至足感佩。</p>
<p>從談話中，知氏近數年來對於各公團職務，業多自動辭退，現在僅任工部局華董，難民救濟協會理事長，寗波旅滬同鄉會委員長，工部局華董一職，歷屆改選，虞氏連任迄今，未嘗更動，蓋不但具有悠久之歷史關係，爲中外各界所推崇：即虞氏本人，亦以對租界市政之志願，尙未達預期之目的，故仍在繼續效力。氏對於任何公私職務，素以負責爲前提，不論寒暑，每日必到其辦公處。宴會慶弔，亦必躬親參與。每晚七八時許，尚在辦公處中。公私函電，無不親自過目，即星期休假，亦毫不間斷，其服務精神，實堪爲後輩師法。至其個人生活，極爲節約，衣長衫玄褂，均係國產。生平無特殊嗜好，殆頗適合於大衆化。氏對於各報內容，頗爲關切，承其對本報深加贊美，許爲工商界之良好讀物。</p>
<p>記者於謁見虞氏後，首請氏本其個人服務社會之經慶，對於靑年服務工商界發抒意見。氏謂以個人處世之經騐言，不脫以忠信勤儉四字爲主要目的，蓋忠信所以處世，勤儉所以修身，環顧世界成大事業之人，無一非循此途徑，即以本人而論，幼年處境，極爲艱困，現在謬承社會推許，亦始終以此四字爲服膺。近來世風日下，崇尙新奇，，而滬上環境複雜，靑年稍有不愼便入岐途，卒致身毀名裂。氏並謂關於此點，久欲提出與滬上工商界相互勉，旣承相詢，亦僅卑無高論，所冀靑年能身體力行耳</p>
<p>嗣記者復詢以救濟事業之近况，氏謂本人對於市區內救濟事業，向以熱心効勞爲志願，自八一三戰事發生，戰區難民，紛集本市，其數多至百萬。幸賴中外各救濟團體，不辭勞瘁，合力同心，實施救濟工作，嘉惠難胞，厥功甚偉。嗣以辦理一年以上，中外人士，苦心毅力，至足欽感，揆諸人類互助原則，凡居留上海人士，咸有責無旁貸之義務，爰經中外人士協商，於上年十一月間，組設上海難民救濟協會，推本人爲理事長。本人以當時難民，尚有十餘萬，均係窮苦無歸，爲發揮人民力量，藉以减少振濟委員會對上海難民之憂慮，且得節减振款，移救內地難胞起見，協會之組設，實屬不容或緩。事前經本人與素有交誼之外商領袖，市商會，銀錢業公會，地方協會，慈善團體等洽商，對於救濟難民，均承表示熱心協助，協會遂吿成立，開始實行救濟工作，迄今已將半載，巳在延平路惇信路籌設第一第二收容所兩處，將兩租界中心區各收容所酌量遷併，於管理上旣多便利，一面並允久借市房。惟救濟難民，允應敎養兼施，以期他日得成爲自食其力之生產者，故於會中增設敎育委員會及敎育處，聘請熱心義務之學界名流，共策進行。依本人年齡，巳應退休，但爲救濟難民，義不容辭，不得不勉力担負，亦以表本人熱心効勞之微意而巳。</p>
<p>記者復就滬市情形，續作各項之探詢：虞氏情緒熱烈，令人感奮，嗣談及氏早年服務社會經過，記者謂將以先生之德行，以勗來者。先生笑謝，謂若以本人經歷爲上海小掌故談則可，蓋猶諸貴報新闢之舊聞新抄耳。氏謂本人於遜淸光緒八年（卽西曆一八八一年）來滬，迄今巳五十八年。此五十八年中，所目睹而身歷者，倘欲一一述之，殆覺千頭萬緒，茲就記憶所及較爲犖犖大者言之：　（一）</p>

<p>哨兵喝止煞車肇禍</p>
<p>惟悉互撞案發生於午後九時零五分左右、時李里博士等三人視察雷士德學校房屋後、循閔行路而返、聞該車行將折入百老滙路再過外白渡橋時、遇日哨兵一名、喝令停駛、車未立刻停止、該哨兵即躍登踏板、高聲呼李里停駛、李里立即用力踏制動機、惟因入晚降雨、路面濘滑、故李里之車、猛然滑過閔行路興百老匯路之轉角、而撞及自外白渡橋北駛之日方公共汽車一輛、其勢甚猛、車乃全毀、公共汽車頭部亦損壞頗重、常即向救火會吿警、召來救護車但車抵時、李里已殞命、乃將其屍及李里夫人與西捕頭維氏舁送公濟醫院、</p>

<p>日軍威脅毆擊總巡</p>
<p>記者於公濟醫院中目覩驚異之象、若干衣便服及制服之租界警務處人員中有日軍官一員、諒係日本海軍陸戰隊官員、偕執步槍之衛兵兩名、蹀蹤招待室中、操日語堅令他人示以傷者病室與導往負責醫生處、並操日語詢諸警務處帮辦總巡桑森氏、桑森不諳日語米解其意、詎該日軍官竟揮拳擊中桑森右耳之下、並揮令外出、桑森力持鎭定、後退數武、旋見日軍官復以威脅態度、行近其前、乃謂渠將偕虹口捕房日籍總巡復返、而後出院赴虹口捕房、但該日籍總巡雖經電話相召、至午後十時十五分猶未到院、</p>
<p>圖見傷者卒遭拒絕</p>
<p>日軍官旋復偕其他同時到達之數人、圖再度强入病室、但爲醫治傷者之麥克高列克與安徒遜兩醫生所阻止、日軍官見所行失敗、企圖阻止任何人出院、並圖將招待室中諸人、悉數引人一室、旨在加以詢問、桑森被擊後、復發生一微小之事件、西捕頭維氏所穿皮鞋與警帽、由醫生交衣便服之警務處某副警目持出、上述日軍官見狀、突操英語詢副警目自何處取得鞋帽、何故取之、答係醫生交彼、該日軍官乃不語、出事後一小時、有日軍官兵約二十五人、在塲測量路闊而紀錄之，虹口捕房探員一名亦在塲紀錄、日籍攝影者則拍攝電光照相、</p>
<p>子患咳嗽母請返家</p>

<p>窮苦青年宜努力於科學，且有發名成業之可能，吾前已言之矣。茲願對於富有之青年，謹貢愚見，以為勸勉。富有之青年席父兄餘蔭，生活既無問題，讀書求學，毫無困難。窮苦者能立志鑽研科學，尚可成為專家，造福國家社會，享大名於不朽。若以饒有資財，機會便利之青年，倘肯有志進求，其在科學上之樹立，當更不可限量。英國之戈爾登氏（Galton）即係由富有之青年而成為科學歷史上之偉人者。戈氏幼時，因家計富裕，不需亟亟謀生，而對於科學頗喜自修，最初研究地理學，嘗在歐洲大陸及南菲洲作汗漫之遊，旋又研究氣象學，生物學，數學等，最後專攻遺傳學，在此學中奠定人種改良學（Eugenics　即俗譯優生學），在人體測量學上貢獻尤大，竟與達爾文赫胥黎斯賓塞爾諸人齊名。歐美各國之富有青年，在科學上成大功顯大名與此相類者，不勝枚舉，皆善用自己之機會，利己利世者。吾國富有之青年當以之為模範也。俄國改革之後，昔日之貴族富豪皆家産蕩然，其中有精於各種科學者，現分佈各國充任大學教授或專門技師，生活安定，聲名益著。而其席豐履厚，懶惰無能者，竟至無以自存，流落異邦，淪為乞丐。此乃吾國人所目觀，富有之青年宜引以為戒者也。吾國昔日遭遇空前之大難，前綫抗敵之戰士，不惜捐軀成仁，肝腦塗地，爭取民族之自由，政府領袖發動全國之精神總動員。富有之青年不乏熱心愛國之士，共各崛起奮鬥，利用稀有之機緣，致力於科學之造就，或在學校肄業，或在家中自學，將資財，時間，精力用之於科學工作，必有裨益於國家之前途。望有志者勿以吾言為河漢也。</p>
<h3 id="c111">造鋼鐵的故事 <a href="#c111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— 心</p>
<p>鐵可說是到處都有，大概取和氧化合的形式，就是氧化鐵。若將氧化鐵同炭和在一起加熱，就可得鐵。照這樣所得的是生鐵或軟鐵，礦石裹的雜質大都包在裏面，經燒熱後錘打，就可失去大部分。普通鐵匠就做這種工作，打成各種形式。不過性質太軟，不合實用，又不能作為烊鐵（翻砂）之用。因為要到華氏二七00度才烊，這是純鐵的烊點。然而人們很是聰明，居然有法煉硬。先將軟鐵打成所要的樣子，再埋在　炭中加熱，取出來浸入水裏或油裏。功夫好的人可以煉成硬得像近代所練的刀鋒一樣。當時的人自然知其然而不知其所以然。我們現在知道炭會慢慢的侵到鐵裏，好像　氣侵入木頭一樣。鐵裏有了炭，在熱的時候忽然急冷，就會變硬了。因為炭是從外面鑚進去的。所以本領高的鐵匠，會煉成一把刀鋒很快刀身很韌的武器。他們確能造好的鋼，不過產量不會很大，價格也很高。</p>
<p>同時烊鐵的方法也研究出來了，就是用深厚的炭爐，　風進去，將鐵深埋在裏面就會烊了。但是結果所得的，不很像是鐵，因為變得很脆，像玻璃一樣。但是可以用來翻砂。二百年前所用的鐵都是這種鑄鐵。我們知道照這樣做成的鐵，含炭多至百分之三·五，烊點也減低三五00度，但是比黃銅的烊點還高。在二十世紀的初年，還用這種方法製鐵。所用的爐子每天袛可出鐵六噸。</p>
<p>在當時鋼就是用軟鐵造成的，不過產量很少。到了一八五六年，德國卑士茂想出壓迫空氣吹入硬鐵裏，自然燃燒。經過二十分鐘可以造成十五噸的鋼。這樣，使脆的鐵變成柔的鋼，又比軟鐵來的堅強。因此價格降低了不少，可以大造鐵路了。</p>
<p>除此之外，尚有開底爐法。這個方法好像比不上卑士茂法，一則燃料要用得多，二則產量又不能很大。但是因為可以用任何一種鐵做原料，造成的鋼品質亦比較的好。所以在三十年前，用開底爐所造的鋼已比用卑士茂法所造的數量要超過了。到了十年前，竟超過到七倍之多。</p>
<p>無論所造的是鋼是鐵，需要空氣來助燃處是一樣的。實在即是需要的氧氣。但是空氣中只有百分之二十三是氧氣。所以若能直接利用氧氣，又可改良镕煉的方法了。可是氧氣價格太高，就不合算。近來製造氧氣的方法有了進步，逐漸使用氧氣，果然大有成效。成本可以減輕，產量可以增加，品質可以勻凈，手續可以簡單，原料燃料都可以用次等的，雜質像硫和燐都可以減少了。硫和燐在鋼鐵中都是有害的成分，根本要不得的，用了氧氣可以燒的乾淨了。</p>

<p>現在最新式的偵察機花房式的，會在美國陸軍會操時試過，結果甚佳。該項偵察機實際上好像一個飛行花房。它的長的駕駛室頂全由透明的玻璃板蓋蔽，足供視綫達到至大的範圍。機身為腰翼式，內裝一具850馬力的發動機，並有可以收藏的着陸輪。這是最利於高空偵察的飛機。</p>

<p>— 橋下客</p>
<p>古人有八千歲為春，八千歲為秋之說，真的是事實嗎？</p>
<p>現在不談考據，且問人壽究竟幾何。以個人來講，則百齡上壽，眼前大家都知道確有這樣一位老壽星。然而［人生七十古來稀］，多數的人還活不到七十歲。人壽究竟幾何，用什麽方式來督告呢？有常識的人都會說，可用平均數作報告。這是對的，這種報告就呌平均壽命。假使有兩個人，一個週歲而死，另一個五十九歲而死，他們兩人共有的年齡為六十，平均之美容得三十。此處大家看得明白，凡是嬰兒死得較多的地方，該地方人民的平均壽命必然較短。平均壽命與嬰兒死亡率的關係太深，換言之，大人竟被小兒帶累了，所以用來報告人壽幾何，還不大妥當。現在各國人壽的比較，是用［中等壽命］來報告的。假定某處於某年某月某日生產了一百個小孩子，這一百個同年齡的人當然一齊生長，當然有的半路折回老家。在孩童時期死的不算，如果到了六十六歲死的人數是最多數，那就以六十六歲為中等壽命，或稱正常壽命。前進國家的正常壽命已達七十歲以上，這是以多數作報告的，至於百齡上壽，不妨以祥瑞目之，放在一邊。</p>
<p>正常壽命的大敵，不外刀兵疫癘水旱等災。如將戰爭除外，則衛生行政完善的國家，其人民比較的得終其大年，并非另有奇異的續命湯與還魂草。至於不死之藥，返老還童之術，在　來　漢武所求之而不得省，　以科學之月異日新，今世尚無法得之。用邏輯眼光來看，不死與還童是不可能的，一旦能之，反而是開倒車，是退化的。何以呢？本來我們未老，早已還童；我們未死，早已轉生－－還是指我們的生兒育女或甚至抱孫呀！我們已把不死與還童的重大責任交給一部份器官－－生殖器官－－全權辦理，還是分工的辦法，是進步的現象。如果我們活到七十歲時，喫下一些什麽金丹仙藥，於是一變而為乳嬰，與孫兒輩爭乳喫，這豈不是畫蛇添腳嗎？如果喫了仙藥之後，竟一我變兩我，兩我變四我，繼續不斷的照此變下去，那就等於裂菌，退化到了極點了。或者說，我們最好停留在二十歲或三十歲的時候。咦！中華民國大總統的法定年齡是四十歲，這顯然是違法之言。此外，生命的特微是不間斷的物質交換，停留是辦不到的。金聖歎序西廂，在痛哭古人一篇中說得十分的慨當以慷：對的，今日之我已非畫為昨日之我，若干細胞死去，若干細胞新生，這就是不停的物質交換，還沒有到斷氣的時候就悲慟起來，這是聖歎的聰明過人處。</p>
<p>人類在同一衛生環境之下，仍有夭壽之不齊，這是有關於遺傳的了。原來壽是有種的，壽種之後，雖身體薄弱，往往亦享高齡。各種動物的壽命都有相當的範圍，譬如龜約二百年，犬約三十年，這是造傳的種性，凡是龜總有那樣的壽命，凡是犬總不過這樣的壽命，衛生不能把兩者的壽命劃齊。</p>

<p>鐵肺早已試驗成功，可以治病。現在又有一種機械可以代替心和肺的作用。將來心臟和肺臟如果偶然有損壞，生命或者有法可以苟延。該項機械，美國一個試驗所正在試驗，並且已證明他確有延長動物生命之效。</p>
<p>機械心肺的作用大概如次。用一個管插入靜脈中，由一個電力唧筒把血液吸出，再由傳血管射至機械肺。傳血管外套有一玻璃管；內外兩管壁的中間有熱水流行不息，保持血液的溫度。機械肺是一個鍍鉻的銅圓筒，轉動迅疾，每一分鐘達幾百次。因這樣迅速轉動，血液被灑在圓筒內壁上成一導膜，對於經過筒腔內的氧氣，容易吸收。血液經氧氣漂清後，再由唧筒送入動物的體內。這和血液在健康的人體內由心臟，經靜脈，至肺臟，受肺內氧氣漂清，再經靜脈而仍歸入心臟的手續是一樣的。附圖左邊圓筒是人造肺。中央的斜玻璃管貯着暖水，以保持血液於適當溫度。</p>

<p>我們平常都以為地球兩極所受的太陽光，比赤道所受的少。但是奇怪得很，事實上卻是相反。因為太陽光射到地球上時，被大氣所屈折的緣故，所以當太陽已落地平綫下時，兩極上仍可看到太陽。據科學家計算，此種屈折作用能在地球的兩極上增加105小時的太陽光，但在赤道上之只增加40小時。換句話說，即是兩極赤道每年多受到65小時的太陽光</p>

<p>我說，不，一定不，歐洲的局勢，決不會就此下塲，以爲正處在另一種大擾動的醞釀期中，其揭露之期，也許並不在遠了。因爲法西斯國並未放棄侵略，而民治國還是不能澈底合作，兩者的軋礫和激盪，到底是難免的。</p>

<p>周知事正因宜撫班長要請他到城外去出巡，心上老大不願意，捧着一碗白木耳，用小銀匙不停的攪，呆視着白糊糊的熱氣出神。王姨太斜靠在門邊，瞧得有趣，順手拍的一聲，把電鈕關了，立時房間裏黑了下來。周知事猛地一驚，把碗往桌上一推，站起來就想躱，忽聽得一串嬌蕩的笑聲，才曉得是王姨太，接着電燈也亮了，這才重新坐下。王姨太花枝招展的撲過來，周知事重新端起碗來，又像怒又像愛的說：</p>
<p>「這類玩笑，開不得呢。警察局長剛被刺，我的性命也掛在半空裏，你們不要只懂胡鬧……」</p>
<p>「別說罷，誰呌你當這臭差使！」王姨太湊過來，張開嘴，粉臉又白又紅，接着問：「够甜不够甜？」</p>

<p>周知事趕忙推去王姨太，放下碗，莊嚴地問：</p>

<p>張媽鄭重地捧着一個紙包，走近桌子邊，雙手捧給周知事。王姨太接過來，但立刻放到桌子上，嘴一尖：</p>
<p>「嗄，好重！」</p>
<p>周知事一面檢視那個包，一面聽張媽說：</p>
<p>「門房送進來，說是一個小伙子送來的，問他要回片不要，他說不必不必，扭身走了。」</p>
<p>一個小伙子，不要回片，包上沒有字，又這樣重！他抖抖地仔細來解那繩，那繩結得緊，好一會解不開。王姨太不耐煩，搶過去就想撕，，重手重脚的。周知事發起急來，趕忙按住了王姨太的手：</p>
<p>「輕點輕點，當心別是炸彈！」</p>
<p>王姨太一聽，嚇得縮回手，撲過來抱住了周知事，粉臉變了色，駡張媽：</p>
<p>「怎麼不問問淸楚，那裏送來？裏面是什麼東西？就這麽糊裏糊塗的捧了進來……」</p>

<p>— 亞路</p>
<p>不違背三民主義，不違背政府法令，不違背國家民族的利益，這是國民精神總動員網領上的國民公的十二條中的開頭三條。凡是懂得國民精神總動員意義的人，對這二個問題一定不會忽略過去。</p>
<p>對於有利於國家民族的條件，沒有違背的舉動，固然可算一個好國民，但是嚴格說起來，僅僅做到不違背的程度，在這抗戰時期，似乎還不够。我們必須更進一步去切實地實行三民主義，政府法令和爲國家民族增進利益的事情。</p>
<p>不過我們要實行這三件工作，必須對它有深切的認識。第一，我們要知道三民主義就是救國主義，因爲它的目標一是求得民族的解放，二是求得民權的自由，三是求得民生的平等。目前中國最重要的工作就是正爲民族求解放的抗戰，民族旣得解放，民權的自由，民生的平等，就可迎刃而解了。但是我們要實行三民主義，必須要認識我們國家的地位，增强我們民族的意識，而且更要有忠於國忠於事忠於民的精神，把各人的才力錢力儘量貢獻於民族解放的鬥爭上。</p>
<p>第二點關於政府的法令，不但不能違背而且要各盡能力去實行。國民精神總動員法令，是現階段最迫切需要實行的。蔣委員長早巳說過：「抗戰轉入第二期後，敵人在軍事上巳經是進退維谷，一天一天的窘迫，一天一天的徬徨了；最近敵人側重政治舞弄，揑造事實，離間國人，無非先要制服我們的精神，分解我們的精神，然後來征服我們整個民族……。」所以有了這次國民精神總動員的法令，當足以淬勵人民的志氣，增進人民對於國家的認識，堅强人民對於勝利的信念，振作人民抗戰的精神，使敵人政治的陰謀，動搖和麻醉的手段無所施其伎。</p>
<p>第三點是實行爲國家民族增强利益的問題。視個人的利益高於國家民族的利益，這實在是一種自私自利觀念。古人說：「皮之不存，毛將焉附，」這就是說人民與國家有脣齒相依的關係，如其國家到了不能生存的時候，人民就根本享受不到安居樂業的利益，而被人家當作奴隸對待了。所以國家的利益應該視爲高於一切。中國現在抗戰求生，凡是有利於國家利益的工作，我們應得集中力量去做。因爲國家得到復興後，人民纔得享受無窮盡的利益。</p>
<p>抗戰必勝，建國必成，我們必須把國民精神總動員切切實實地實行，不僅不違背而已。</p>
<h3 id="c124">山中雜話 <a href="#c124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— 熾强</p>
<p>我到山中去，並不是爲養病，更無意於寫文章；因此，對於住，沒有找過荒殘滅沒的寺院和古刹，用不到「禪房花木深」也。</p>
<p>「久矣夫非一日矣」的舉世士夫，似乎都這樣公認：貧窮可以生疾病；疾病能彀煥乎其有文章。大概非貧不足以致病，非病不足以語「困獸鬥智」而收「工」的效果，而無山則辜負了旣窮之骨，旣病之軀。，而且不僅不足以使文章瑰瑋雄渾，就是要悱惻纏綿，也無地用武；好像。</p>
<p>因此，山是高人的，雅士的，墨客的，說山是文章之庫，要用病的鑰匙去啟發，也未始不可！</p>
<p>然而我從來沒有羨慕過：高山上，流水間，病榻旁，藥渣裏收穫得來的而且據說還稱心的那一批副產品。不過文章要「工」，應該先經得起「窮」；「窮」要耐得住病；「病」要到山中去開闢文章思路，則叉似乎是古往今來一班文人登起龍來馬到成功的僅有的一貫的捷徑。</p>
<p>而我，這些都沒有，就是貧窮也還不肯以貧窮自矜由反宣傳而收風雅之效；雖然怎樣可以「見志」，而無病之吟，允其不肯馬虎將就。况且光是靠幾根肋膜炎，就是眞的能彀到文壇旁邊去兜兜圈子，也還是要提防絆脚石，壓倒了不支的體力上來，作興以病害文，誤盡天下蒼生！</p>
<p>所以，這回入山，非常慚愧，理由是一點沒有病。沒有病，到山中去，好像是掛名的詻議，白領乾薪，不辦公事。然而該死的，就是一入叉入得這麼樣子深，雖然前人主張「入山惟恐不深」，而一個沒有「名山事業」的企圖的我，多少總覺得徒然！縱不至有人來指摘浪費層巒幽壑，然而對於點首的羣峯，黛翠含情的蜂腰鶴膝，往往因爲自己沒有「帶病圖功」，終於覺得有點「尸位素餐」的羞答答；即不然，那種不肯「謹避炎路」（炎是指一切氣管支炎或肋膜炎而言）的倔强精神，巳經百喙莫贖假充斯文的罪愆了！</p>
<p>如果健全的事業，寄存於健全的身體上的一句話有幾分眞實性的存在，那末，至少寫文章還得要健全的身體；好文章要好身體，肺病，吐口把血，究有什麽相干呢？</p>
<p>想到太史公登泰岱，窺崆峒，大概不是「臥遊」的，而况那時候旣無公路網，更不會像台州黃岩或雲貴一帶那些盤旋到山頂上的汽車，則文章的磅礡，還得靠健旺的精神，輕捷的脚力。</p>
<p>雖然有人說他是殘廢後的悒鬱冲散成文，但我們決不可輕視那一「宮」。世間許多文士，那一個不垂涎女人，那一個不玩弄女人，寫桃色篇什，把紛華靡麗之處，咏傳給後人，自然「寫你熟習的」爲前輩啟示後學的敎條，然而熟習到脂粉隊裏去，把雪白的大腿一偏共反爾」地讚賞一回，究竟是一件吃力不討好的傻事。</p>
<p>我雖然不提倡大家「宮」了之後才會寫文章，但貧窮疾病，也不一定能殼產生好作品；所以我這回入山，和迢些都沒有關係，而山中雜話的開宗明義，竟走筆到這些不倫不類的思路，上來，未免多餘了。</p>

<p>在大家慷慨解囊之後，共捐到三十二元三角，雖然是極徵的數目，但他們的精神，是值得佩服的，他們拿這筆款子到在裕泰買了二十斤茶葉，就在前天下午三時，由李文俊·曹慕髠·王仲乎·王佩臣·孫德林五君代表送到孤軍營去。</p>
<p>他們到了目的地後，謝晋元團長因身體欠安，由一位營副兼連長的勇士雷雄代表接見，除對他們的熱誠表示欽佩外，並詳細報告從前在四行抗敵的一番壯烈經過，最後還出了一張收二十斤茶葉的收據，那五位代表到裏面參觀一週，各請勇士們在紀念册上簽名後，纔滿意地告辭回來。</p>
<p>在移風劇社發起捐款的時候，大舞台張翼鵬。李瑞來也願意加入，但移風是以團體名義去慰問，所以沒有接受，並希望大舞台的同志們也能發起去慰問一下，張李兩位，都是思想前進的靑年，當然不讓移風專美於前的，我更進一步希望整個伶界都自動的發起吧。</p>

<p>— 蟾</p>
<p>正在攝製中的「獨裁者」是目前最受人注意的影片，注意的範圍不限於好萊塢，而是世界的，連希特勒也密切的注視着。</p>
<p>「獨裁者」之所以受人注意：一是因爲這是卓別鱗機「摩登時代」以後四年來的第一部影片；二是在這影片裏，卓別麟正式開口；三是在這部影片裏，對於某一個獨裁國家的元首有着極幽默尖刻的諷刺。</p>
<p>關於「獨裁者」影片，本刋已經有過好幾次的報道。過去：我們僅僅知道的是：「獨裁者」的故事將以某一個獨裁者統治下的國家爲背景。卓別麟在本片裏祖任着兩個吃重的角色，一是集中營裏的囚犯，一是這個國家的獨裁者。</p>
<p>今年三月初，這部影片正式開拍，有位新聞記者向他採訪該片的消息以及卓氏本人的意見，當時卓別麟僅說：「暫時我不想告訴你，不過我願意使你知道，在這張影片裹將有一個大塲面，需要很多的演員，而我很想儘量的錄用猶太人和德國人。」</p>
<p>現在，卓別麟氏又公開發表了「獨裁者」的內容，劇本是居住在洛杉磯的一個英國無名作家所编，定名「獨裁者」，另一個名稱是：「擠滿了沙魚的世界裏的一尾小魚的故事。」至於劇情呢？是叙述一個名呌查理的「笨人」的冒險故事。</p>
<p>故事的大槪情形是道樣的：</p>
<p>「一九一二年，「伯達馬尼亞」和「愛理耶」兩個國家發生戰事，「笨人」查理是「伯達馬尼亞」國軍隊裏的一個小兵，戰事終止，他是同隊中唯一的刦後餘生者，當他回到「伯達馬尼亞」的首都「伯述」時，一切景象都改變了，和戰前大不相同。一天，他正在午睡，忽然給一隊挺進軍所驚醒，他們正在鞭逐民衆去「擁護」「伯達馬尼亞」國的獨裁者希格爾。查理受驚之餘，逃進了一家餐館，餐館老板免費請他吃飯，結果餐館的全部生財傢具全被挺進軍搗毀，查理則給軍隊送進集中營。但有一天他竟逃了出來，從此就交好運。那天獨裁者希格爾在微服出巡，由於兩人的容貌相像，使衛隊們把查理認爲他們的允首，而眞的獨裁者希格爾却反以假冒元首的罪而進入集中營。查理旣交好運，向民衆演說，而他漂亮的演詞又使全國人民皆大歡喜…結局則是：「笨人」查理從睡夢中醒來，發現他仍被拘在集中營裏……。』</p>
<p>我們看了這劇本的內容，已知道這片的諷刺對象是誰。當然，全片的笑料是一定非常豐富的，無怪卓別麟發表了這影片的大略內容後，整個美國的影迷愈加重視巡部「獨裁者」了。</p>
<p>這影片從三月初拍攝，大的在今年九月間就可公映，那時，影迷的高興和那位獨裁者的憤怒一定是可以預料的，我們且等待着吧！</p>

<p>（四）申曲</p>
<p>申曲，現在風行一時，不但是播音，就是登台表演，也擠得滿坑滿谷，推原其故，因爲是本地風光，唱句通俗，任何人都聽得懂，允共是婦女們最愛聽中曲，從前的申曲太覺粗俗，現在已經改良不少，申曲又名東鄕調，也呌本灘，以前流行小戲，如今注重整本，唱申曲有所謂四大金剛的，就是施春軒施文韻筱文濱筱月珍王筱新王雅琴劉子雲姚素珍，其餘聞名的很多，如范靈儈丁慧琴石筱英衛鳴岐等</p>
<p>（五）歌唱</p>
<p>開收音機聽歌唱，大都以靑年男女和學校子弟居多數，那些頭腦冬哄的老老和口唸彌陀的好婆，決不會聽歌唱的，也有幾齣歌唱是很含意味，也有幾齣歌是太無意識，聽了反使人肉麻，不外乎男女愛情，我們在聽收音機中播唱歌曲的小姐們，總會發出一種嘻嘻哈哈的聲音，無意中是告訴聽衆們她們是在和拉凡啞令的男朋友調笑，這些希望播唱歌曲的小姐們，鄭重一些，別使聽衆們討厭，現在播音圈裏盛行的歌唱社，像益友社琳瑯社慧星歌劇社明星樂社嘉祿社兄弟社黎明社鳳凰社柳鶯歌劇社白鶴社中華社中國歌劇社光藝社大同社上海社東方社嗚音社時代社榮康社良友社爵士社知音社白光社等，其中以爵士社牌子最老，人材最多。</p>
<p>（六）四明文書</p>
<p>四明文書的聽衆，以吃素唸佛的老婆婆居其多數，和歌唱相比，適得其反，播唱的脚本，都是些修仙得道勸善懲惡的故事，情節貫串，極盡悲歡離合的能事，勸化世人，提倡道德，倒也引起一般善男信女的注意，在播音圈裹却也佔得相當地位，此中健將當推張仁心何貴章李茂椿在公俠唐劍影趙孝本鮑孝文小顯民等，允以張仁心花樣最多，寗波聽衆，多爲他醉心。</p>
<p>（七）四明文藝</p>
<p>四明文戲，即寗波灘簧，又名甬灘，從前唱句粗俗，不堪入耳，自從跑進播音圈之後，已稍加改革，但是登台表演，故態復萌，如果主持者能逐漸改良，未嘗不是一種很好的地方戲，在播音圈裏能够立足的，要算筱鳳仙孫翠娥傳彩霞金翠香等，唱起來比較文雅些</p>
<p>（八）南方戲</p>
<p>南方戲又名南方歌劇，幾年前在電台上的確出過風頭，因墨守陳腐，不善改革，到如今已經失敗了，其中碩果僅存的，只有顧秉成張秉仁楊秉章三人，和以前風起雲湧的時代相較，世事滄桑，眞令人感嘆呢。</p>

<p>舊劇中之「戰蒲關」，本包括幼主逃難，被圍搬兵，直至援至擒賊等段落，此劇爲一最精彩之歷史佳奏，惜時下演者極少，即有亦多僅唱王覇殺妾犒軍一段而已，名坤伶章遏雲，唱念武工，極爲優越，特將此劇有關之劉秀夫人郭氏，蒲關守將王覇之妾徐艷貞，與耿純之子耿耳三人之史實，連續在一起，作爲中心人物，經長時期之研討，重將此劇排成一部最偉大之歷史名劇，文武穿挿極繁，遏雲個人分飾兩個角色，計前部飾王覇之妾徐艷貞，後部飾耿耳，耿耳一角係反串小生性質，似此忽釵忽弁，允文允武，一人連飾兩個作風不同之角色，眞可稱爲繁重吃力，魄力驚人，在今日坤伶隊裏，且有此種不怕累之魄力者，恐無出諸章遏雲之右者矣，茲將劇情錄后：</p>
<p>漢滅莽，諸將畏劉秀英明，立劉玄爲帝，封秀蕭王，秀征河北，赤眉大王劉盆子攻長安，玄臣胡英降，劉玄遁，劉秀部將邳彤，萬秀，保秀二子走蒲關，耿純保秀夫人郭氏陰氏亦逃，劉盆子圍蒲關甚急，彤修書求救，蒲關守將王覇，日夜防守，糧盡軍欲潰，乃殺妾徐艷貞及僕劉忠以饗士卒，邳彤萬修，途鴻耿純之子耿耳，智激之，耿耳發兵救蒲關，殺胡英，園得解。</p>
<p>此係舊本老戲，經章暹雲重加排成，此部乃偉大傑作，洵足一展章之天才也，全劇目錄，附誌於决，劉盆子兵犯長安，邳彤萬修保主逃生，郭夫人出宮避禍，衆賊兵團困蒲關，王將軍殺妾報國，徐貞娘伏劍捐軀，智邳彤巧激少將，勇耿耳大破赤眉。</p>

<p>王漢倫與周妹妹靜安寺路仙樂舞宮連日由歌聖洛平暨金嗓子卡門小姐會奏世界最新名歌以還，每晚盛况空藙。昨晚起又有當代馳名紅星王漢倫小姐及周妹妹小姐，重返該宮伴舞，按王周兩紅星原在該宮候敎，自因病輟舞後，迄巳多時，茲者病愈再行伴舞，更較過去嫵媚健美。又紅遍港滬巨星黃弟媚弟（即海曙樓弟弟）准於明日（二十六日）重返該宮伴舞，誠舞國佳訊也。</p>
<p>舞國驕子蕭美麗　中央舞廳的伴舞蕭美麗，眞可以稱得起一聲舞國的驕子她永遠閃燦着光芒，從沒有灰黯一點。一個紅舞星成就的條件是多方面的，蕭美麗就因為她具有一個淸脆的嗓子，和苗條的身段，同時舞藝又純熟，待人又和善，所以才有着這樣的地位。最近，在中央舞廳的舞池　忽然見不到蕭美麗的芳姿，這自然很使人懷欵，難道蕭美麗失踪了嗎？有的說她已經給人量珠聘去藏妖金屋了，然而這些蜚言流語是不確的，事實的反映，她仍將於今晚（二十六）重進中央舞廳伴舞，這當然要使舞國同志欣喜欲狂了。</p>

<p>長樂之部</p>
<p>長樂劇塲去年秋季所創，前台爲票友徐雁秋及金永堅兩君主持，以票友而營「小型劇塲」，成續當然可觀，所羅致之角色甚佳，惜班底太弱耳。</p>
<p>樂弟，爲仇月祥之女徒，仇爲坤角鬚生泰斗孟小冬之開蒙師，外傳樂弟與孟小冬爲親姊妹者不確，實師兄妹也，唱工比做工好，「探母回令」一劇，每演必賣滿堂，餘如「上天台」「珠簾寨」「奇寃報」，皆稱拿手，內行中人咸稱道之。</p>
<p>朱　　，亦坤角老生，做勝於唱，「追信」「跑城」「掃松」「打嵩」一路麒派戲甚好，年僅十九，爲昔日馳譽菊部之名且「海棠紅」之女。</p>
<p>董芝蘭，演靑衣花旦，乃名武生蕭蘭亭掌珠，扮相欠佳，嗓音甚好，字眼欠研究，演蔴姑獻壽一劇，雙足踏一巨球上，兩手以食指各舞一銀盤，坤旦中不易多見。</p>
<p>花美容，年十八，厥貌一若江南名坤旦張文琴，係名敎師馬寶剛及琴師馬寶格之姪女，其藝術係渠嬸母花想容所授，扮相嗓子均可，十二歲習劇，十五歲在蘇州開明大戲院登台，由小廣寒而時代，再到長樂，有叫年舞台經騐，最近拜徐雁秋君爲義父，靑衣戲較花旦戲爲佳。</p>
<p>新燕樓本名辛燕樓，坤角武生，開打極盡「結棍」「殺搏」之能事，有人譽之爲女劉漢臣者，惜細於嗓音，不擅唱工。</p>
<p>王翠雲，乃滑稽獨脚戲鼻祖王元能之女，習靑衣花且，惜學戲過遲，於十八歲方開蒙，十九歲出台，在江西露演，越年來申搭更新舞台者一年，今巳二十有三，上裝不及卸裝好看，以王元能昔日之馳譽海上遊藝界，固有「一代藝人」之目，其遺孤不傳衣缽，反侘傺於小型劇塲中，且不爲人所重，其人可憐，其情亦可憫也。</p>
<p>富麗霞，富翠霞，一年十七，一年十四，爲老旦前輩富仙舫女徒，均習且，初從仙舫之女雲霞習藝，麗霞武工頗嫻熟，「十三妹」「虹霓關」等劇，都能演唱，自雲霞嫁人猝死後，其戲即由仙舫親授，至翠霞則因年事尚穉，不過借台唱戲而已。</p>
<p>桂雲峯，乃二十年前之著名坤角武生，與張文艷張少泉等齊名，後改小生，以舞台經騐說來，坤角小生中堪稱前輩。</p>
<p>共餘如楊春岩，胡寶庭，劉少春諸角，皆有可取，長樂塲子較小，惟前後台頗融洽，營業甚盛，聞該塲主人爲革新計，於五月一日起，將座位改善，一律換皮墊新椅，爲小型劇塲放一異彩，並添請名角，以壯陣容云。</p>

<p>昨晚英工部局聚會議事，各商士威在坐，領事官起而聞言曰：一貴商士之羣集於此，則有大事數端，皆爲近今切務，宰諸君熟籌而詳劃之焉。其中之一爲塡高黃浦灘淤渠之處，築成馬路一條。」英工部値首保順東也，起而抗手稱曰：一夫增塡黃浦，是有三策：置水爲椿，密排水底，以作岸基，兼禦水力，而以泥沙石塊，堆積而平之，其所費的估銀十七萬八千兩也；密石爲　，兼　　，以立岸基，而後盡塡實之，其所費的估銀廿五萬五千兩也。至吳淞河口造義橋，設義渡，則尙不在此數。我輩今爲此役，必先籌劃所需之款，方能集事，否則徒託空言耳。」查工部每年收納各款捐項，共計有廿二萬，而每年支用之項，則廿萬零六千，會計餘銀，僅止一萬四千之則，以與此舉，未免所缺太鉅。衆議暫擱云。</p>

<p>紗市漲風復起、良以華南　　帮需要依然淸淡、惟廣西帮採辦興旺、由廣帮某興號代爲購買、從廣州灣北海等處輾轉運輸、且專辦二十支雙馬·天女兩牌爲大宗、人心挺秀、市勢活潑、同時內地布廠對於中身二十支華紗交易亦盛、至於同業、鑒於環境好轉、購買情緒愈加濃烈、市價得此扶植、乃發現皎近以來之新高價、二十支雙馬外棧貨已漲至四百零五元、午後人氣熱烈異常、再漲二元、雙馬現貨價爲四百零七元、已與本年紅盤暗盤價並頭矣、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、市態平靜、香港帮買意活動、開價即漲一元半、二十支雙馬現貨價爲四百零一元半、少頃客帮在市搜羅尤切、且專買雙馬天女兩牌、人氣頓見緊張、且貿氣濃厚、由此現貨愈抽愈緊、一般投機者視現貨緊俏、有難買之感、又將棧單紛紛拖進、現貨及棧單價相繼而升、迨至收盤價、二十支雙馬爲四百零五元、棧單價爲三百九十九元、午後開盤、因香　帮仍有納胃、雙馬售價再跳二元半、查全日各帮買去統計三千九百四十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲七元半、其餘漲二·三元不等、廠方由新生廠開出七支紅萬字五百包、價爲三百元、七月至九月、利泰廠開出十八支醒獅一百五十包、價爲三百五十二元牛、又四百句價爲三百五十四元、今日有出口棉紗四百十件運天津、八十件運烟臺、一百三十五件運厦、一百九十件運汕頭、八百叫十件運香港、五百七十件運廣州灣、七十件運北海、六百七十件運海防、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>

<h3 id="c161">學徒們的好消息　滬東公社開辦　學徒義務夜校四所 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>中區在慈淑大樓五樓滬江大學</p>
<p>南區在五馬路蕪湖路市中中學　　西區在麥特赫斯脫路華民小學　　北區在老閘橋下堍眞如小學內</p>
<p>我們知道，滬江大學設有一個泥東公社，這個機關雖是免不了帶些宗敎意味，但唯一的目標，在爲勞苦大衆謀福利。滬東公社自成立以來，歷史也很久了，以過往的工作說來，的確有着相當的成績，而工作人員的服務精神，也是够使我們佩服的。</p>
<p>楊榭浦是一個工廠集中的地方，附近一帶，所住的男女工人很多。當初滬江大學就看到了這一點，創立了一個專門爲勞工着想的滬東公社。除了設立中小學，收取低廉的學費，使勞工子弟能够普遍的受到敎育外，更設有工人夜校，工人子弟義務學校。關於運動方面，也有相當的設備，更有閱報處，閱書室等設備。同時，他們時常發起各種集會，不是促進勞工的敎育，便是爲勞工謀福利。因此，說起了滬東公社，住在楊樹浦一帶的工人，是每一個都知道的。</p>
<p>「八一三」的砲火，把楊樹浦毀滅了，工廠十九被燬，工人無處工作，滬江大學的校舍，當做了戰地。滬東公社在混亂的情狀之下，跟了滬江大學逃難到租界中區，但滬東公社搬到蘇州河南岸之後，雖什麼都被毀滅了，一切工作却在可能的範圍之內，仍繼續進行。像附設的中小學，繼續借了校舍上課，而所收的學費，還是比一股的學校便宜。同時，夜校也接着開課，更附設了一個汽車學校。</p>
<p>最近我們又得到一個消息，滬東公社募集了捐款，開辦了四所學徒義務學校：中區在慈淑大樓五樓滬江大學，南區在五馬路蕪湖路市中中學，西區在麥特赫斯脫路東新閘路華民小學，北區在老閘橋堍眞如小學。已先後上課。凡是學徒，任何人可以報名入學，學費是完全免去，上課的時間在每晚下午七時至九時，和學徒的工作時間也不相抵觸。事前滬東公社更派了調查員五十人，分赴各區商店，調查學徒的敎育程度，並懇求經理或店主允許他們的學徒求學。學徒敎育的促進，不但有關學徒自己的前途，而且也可帮助商業的改進，的確相當的重要。筆者十二分的深望賢明的經理，店主，能够不加猶預，使每一個學徒都去求學，不要錯過了這個機會。</p>

<p>— 天道</p>
<p>除非瞎子，生了眼睛總得看。不過，當一件東西擋住你視綫的去路的時候，你不能過分信任你的眼球，光學中有一種名詞呌「錯視」，往往把長的「看」成短的，圓的「看」做方的。所以，對於眼前的事物，應該怎樣去「看」，和如何「看」法，是値得硏究的。</p>
<p>據說上海人對於「看」，是頗有研究的。譬如：「看」英皇加冕，連女人的褲子都「看」得晶光了；嵩山路後面大火燒，連住在大世界附近的人都傾巷來觀。而且，「看」過之後，議論紛紛，這個女人怎樣羞得滿面通紅，那個女人怎樣尖聲怪呌：火舌頭在半空中像鴉鵲亂飛，自來水龍頭父宛如游龍。道些「看」在眼請裏的事物，果然都是眞實的，並沒有「錯視」的反應，但是對於這些事物是不是應該道樣「看」，和這樣「看」法呢？所謂「頗有研究」，其實正是太沒有「研究」。</p>
<p>也正因爲「看」的人太沒有研究，被「看」的人也戲法愈變愈多。譬如：明明想撈上「三百萬」，偏說「我豈好利哉」？明明是「投降」，却來一套「避免兩敗俱傷」的巴戲。其他如「閉戶讀書」等等，一點沒有切實的表示，亦無異於施放烟幕，讓人「看」到牛角尖去。</p>
<p>怎樣去「看」，如何「看」法，是値得大研究而研究的，馮着你銳利的目光，穿過了那擋住視綫去路的東西，一看一過明白，「看」個透徹，即使是千嬌百媚的娘兒，也得使她當塲顯出原形，是拖着尾巴的狐狸精。</p>
<p>除非瞎子，生了眼睛總得看，不過要看過明白，「看」個透徹？幷且，就是瞎子，還有耳朶，聽聽那些「啾啾而鳴」，也該知道是那一路的「貨色」了。</p>

<p>和禮錫</p>
<p>嗚呼吾安往兮吾其東，扶桑之水可以濯我胸，我欲一蹴落日紅。盡驅武士親勞農。盡收三阪之金銀鋼鐵銅。日本中華本弟兄，胡爲兵革猶洶洶。少壯之慾方無窮，重臣元老兩耳聾。委蛇狼狽商與工。財賦已竭聚斂充。軍興十室今九空。望夫思子多婦翁。相煎萁豆使我心忡忡。孰云久戰中國必無倖，我如百足之蟲彼在童。彼又如暴富之家嬰災凶。淺者但聞飛機大砲唐克車聲隆隆。危疑恐懼震厥躬。安得一朝紫氣生日宮。百萬鐵鎚鐮刀之衆歌其中。東方携手車書同。炎黃之裔大和風。靑天白日之旗揚蒼穹。櫻花之下大醉傾千鐘！</p>
<p>嗚呼吾安往兮吾其南，太平洋之風浩浩天蔚藍。殖民之地皆我土，夷爲法屬英屬荷屬時兩三。更與菲律賓海南島遙爲遠東門戶之守監。高鼻羣湖豐其頷。中華人民舌已箝。遠東爭霸此可探。誅求將護如養蠶。又如奔馬遭覊銜。動多不平情豈甘。民亦勞止金在函。棕擱椰橡勝杞楠。樹木乃以供實婪。但望祖國生奇男。神武能舉夷狄戡。近聞御示爭負担。富者勞者斬與驂。有民如此使飲魷。臥榻熟睡他人酣。至今虎視猶眈眈。羣公念之何以堪。我腸自熱我懷慙。我口肯似金人緘。我欲出之水火聞者疑狂憨！</p>
<p>嗚呼吾安往兮吾其西，歐洲阻海喧鯨鯢。梟雄豪猾非可齊。以隣爲　龜在泥。七十老翁窮笑嘑。連鷄之勢難俱栖。波蘭走廊上天梯。不與捷克羅馬尼亞爲兩端之　。亦不與南斯拉夫立陶宛風雨同凄凄。英法望之如雲霓。蘇聯親之如旁妻。今日之世惟是俛仰於史達林希特勒莫索里尼。近東有土耳其與提携。濱海以西班牙爲町畦。誰能更於北美以外築億萬萬里黃金之長堤。美人螓首手柔荑。挾彈年少爭相親。香多終見麝焚臍。那有世外桃源蹊。我恐地球如玻璃。雷霆一擊粉碎兩離披。夜氣所召豈茍免，質勝物極觀其倪。據亂遍地多蒺藜。我欲歌之心慘悽！</p>
<p>嗚呼吾安往兮吾其北，工農奮臂張此國。中隔西伯利亞之冰天，戈壁之沙磧。版圖萬里種黃白。遼東有豕飫玉食。化鶴歸來其羽赤。遂使遠交又重譯。同舟胡越見顏色。世殊宋元莫動魄。報吳復楚秦之力。自强之道在不息。五年計劃近可式。整軍防民皆無益。親仁乃足救飢溺。君不見蘇維埃之人俱作役。艱苦要與百姓共朝夕。好惡刑賞亦莫民意逆。又不見蘇維埃之國無貪官污吏亦無一人日鶩聲色玉帛營第宅。黑河水渾烟樹直。哈桑湖畔鳥飛急。兩洲之間接壤多，玉關春風送羗笛。車行更奮垂天翼。我欲從之但脈脈。囊無餘貲爲壯別。人間何世鐵與血。赤幟黃金爭起減！</p>
<p>嗚呼吾安往兮吾其前，中華健兒在幽燕。亦在兩河三晋百粤江淮之山川。游擊神勇萬衆傳。紅軍死綏誰則憐。黃埔子弟拔幟先。趫捷師旅數川滇。紅軍能以正爲偏。制敝孫郞如有權，寗爲玉碎無瓦全。再接冉厲常摧堅。慰勞來者張其拳。我欲從之心茫然。用短殺賊非所賢，口說苦堪逐少年。不然飛書草檄宣。我爲健兒歌一篇。我爲健兒廣播鐃歌於大千。摩崖我有筆如椽。臨流顧影猶翩翩。微恨鬢脚二毛駢。平生飛騰欲生天。前乎前乎奈何淹市塵！不聞砲火聞管絃！</p>
<p>嗚呼東西南北靡所騁。欲前又恐路多梗。嗚呼吾安往兮吾其留。自冬徂夏天如愁。霧如屛幛雨無休。赤日剝膚如在囚。山林城市宜　搜。有時也使人意柔。坡行往往出野趣，樹陰一綠皆田疇。得晴能遊明我眸。佳辰有幾惟春秋。果木不大母苛求。廣柑甜美無或侔。酒酣可以潤我喉。流亡十萬來他州。中人俛仰常有憂。豪强之家歌舞猶。高車兵氣雜牛溲。飛賊不至習愈偷。聞人侈口騰衆咻。勝則驚疑敗掉頭。此輩曾未濁流投。一官旅退閒我謀。半菽支撑二年周。亦云官大我欲羞。大人虎　今巢鳩。邦陋到眼盾與矛。傷哉芻豆覊驊騮！</p>
<p>編者按：林庚白先生自戰亂後即入重慶，現在編「今詩選」中，「嗚呼吾安往兮」其近作也。作者致友人書中云：長歌六章，深自喜，以爲劃時代之作，古人所未　有也，得母以爲誇大否？可見其自得之一般。</p>

<p>The Jugular Vein of the Japanese Army in Hunan and Hubei is Severed</p>
<p>Guilin: The news of the recapture of Gaoan, Tongshan, and other places has spread here, and all citizens are celebrating with joy and high morale. A Central News Agency reporter specifically visited a senior staff officer of the headquarters this morning to inquire about the importance of recapturing the two major strongholds. He excitedly replied, "Our army has firmly grasped the enemy's jugular vein, causing their limbs to sink into an inescapable quagmire." He continued, "Gaoan is a shortcut to invade Changsha from the north. The enemy's strategic intention in making every effort to occupy it lies in this. However, after the enemy was exhausted in the Battle of Nanchang, we responded with our original strength, giving the enemy the most violent assault, and Gaoan was recaptured. The enemy in Nanchang is now under our control. Under the pressure of our effective power, they have lost the ability to counterattack and will increasingly fall into our encirclement, leading to collapse. The recapture of Tongshan was indeed beyond the enemy's expectations and is also a victory in our strategy. Tongshan is a major stronghold for the enemy in the northern Hunan-Jiangxi war sequence and a transportation hub for Jiujiang, as well as an important auxiliary to the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway. Our army's recapture of this area is tantamount to driving a fatal wedge into the enemy's core, cutting off their blood supply and severing their limbs. The enemy's situation is gradually becoming unfavorable. Therefore, in our army's continued fierce offensive, the enemy's future crisis is serious, which can be understood without saying."

<p>Japanese Dispatch Korean Reinforcements to Open Up Henan</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a Chinese military spokesman's statement today, Chinese guerrillas have cut the Tongpu Railway into several sections. Fierce fighting has now broken out at the southern end of the railway. The Japanese authorities have dispatched a large army to Shanxi and Kaifeng to resist the advance of the Chinese forces. The Japanese commander, deeply aware of the strength of the Chinese offensive, has dispatched 10,000 Korean troops to Kaifeng, Shanxi, in an attempt to resist. In addition, the fighting around Linfen is very intense. In the past ten days, the Japanese army has suffered over a thousand casualties. The Chinese forces on the central China front are advancing westward and eastward from Tongshan. It is reported that Daban has been recovered. Chinese forces are now continuing to advance towards Nanchang. They are also attacking Fengxin and Jing'an, because if the Chinese forces recapture the above two places, they can advance eastward, cut off the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway, and inflict a major blow on the Japanese army's lines of communication. The spokesman also stated that he believed that the Japanese side was gathering heavy troops in Suiyuan, Pingjin, Shanghai, and other places, so that once a war broke out in Europe, the above areas would become the basis for future wars, or could become the center for responding to demonstrations by certain European countries. However, assuming that war does not break out in Europe, the above areas will take a defensive stance and not attack. (Associated Press Dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e6">Britain's Conscription Problem and the International Situation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>It is quite pointless for us to offer our approval or opposition to the internal political issues of other countries, especially when they are still being debated and unresolved within those countries. However, today, let us briefly discuss the issue of Britain's implementation of conscription. This matter is not pointless; it is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>Britain has historically adopted a volunteer army system, and later, to adapt to the needs of the environment, it also adopted a "National Volunteer Service System." Recently, it has been advancing at full speed towards a "National Mandatory Service System," "National Military Training," "Conscription," and the advocacy and movement of other modified conscription methods. Progressing gradually, it is nearing maturity, and thus the issue of implementation has been raised. The advocacy and movement have been sharp for several months, and yesterday it was the main topic of discussion in the cabinet meeting; it has not yet been formally discussed, so of course no decision has been made. Examining the divisions of the issue, the majority of cabinet members advocate establishing the principle of implementing conscription, but their plans under the principle are not entirely the same; there is also a faction in power who believes that conscription is a new method that violates British traditional thinking and traditional methods. Now, those who advocate and move for the implementation of the new method are the authorities of the Conservative Party, which has always been considered orthodox, while the more progressive opposition party opposes it. It has evolved into a reversed spectacle, almost a comedic role reversal. Although each has its own arguments, we need not discuss the affairs of the British Isles.</p>
<p>What we will discuss is that the problem is in Britain, but the impact is international. World events are like drawing silk threads or peeling bananas; the more you draw or peel, the deeper you go, and the more the true nature is revealed. In other words: the world's chaos is caused by very complex factors, but it is quite related to the decline of British power; the world's stability depends on many efforts, but if Britain can quickly catch up, it will be an important factor in stability. Therefore, attributing the chaos to Britain and crediting the stability to Britain are both excessive, but the closeness and importance of the connection are undeniable. Italy successively destroyed Abyssinia and Albania, shedding only a small amount of blood; to destroy a country with so little bloodshed, proportionally far less than slaughtering chickens and cattle, the cost is not worth mentioning. Germany successively annexed Austria and Czechoslovakia, without shedding a drop of blood. It is said that knowing oneself and knowing the enemy guarantees victory in every battle; the four countries that were destroyed and annexed were indeed deeply known by Germany and Italy, so they were seized in one fell swoop. But isn't Britain acting as the leader of Europe? In the League of Nations, it was clearly the leader; for more than ten years, it has been supporting Germany and Italy, clearly the leader; for the past month, it has been providing guarantees to Poland, providing guarantees to Romania, determined to provide guarantees to Eastern Europe and all the countries of the Balkan Peninsula, again clearly the leader. How dare Germany and Italy disregard the leader and act so recklessly? It's nothing more than that Germany and Italy, who shed only a small amount of blood or even no blood, have actually made the world talk of tigers and change color, and praised them as military powers, simply because Britain, with its generosity, is a non-military leader. Knowing oneself and knowing the enemy, Germany and Italy also know Britain.</p>
<p>Britain has always taken Germany and Italy lightly, saying that I have more pounds and they are poor, but they don't know that pounds cannot be directly used to deal with German and Italian air raids to ensure the safety of the pounds. Only when they used pounds to strengthen air defense did they begin to slightly restore the appearance of a leader. However, Germany and Italy's wings are gradually becoming full, and the momentum is like a prairie fire. Although Britain possesses an absolute advantage in the navy, it has quickly caught up and has an air force that is evenly matched. Not to mention that the decisive key to a full-scale war is that there must be a large army; even if there is no war, without a large army in diplomacy, there is no way to gain the trust of strong allies and obtain allies, nor can it comfort weak allies and overcome guarantees. A few days ago, France expressed doubt about Britain's inability to resolutely improve its current army system; such expressions of doubt have profound implications in diplomacy. Britain's negotiations with the Soviet Union have been going on for a long time, but have not yet been completed. The key to the rumors is not entirely credible, but the weakness of Britain's army strength, insufficient to be an ally of the Soviet Union, is also a possible reason. Which countries in Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula do not fear the fierce aggression of Germany and Italy? They should all be inclined to the goodwill guarantees of other powerful countries, but those who run between London and Paris also go to Berlin and Rome; why is this so? Isn't it because they fear that although Britain promises guarantees, its weak army strength will be unable to do anything? Even if France and the Soviet Union, as well as the countries of Eastern Europe and the Balkan Peninsula, are not satisfied with Britain's small army; in Germany and Italy, from the diplomatic stage to speeches, although they see the aging and growing strength of Chamberlain, who is determined to be a hero, but based on the fact that Britain's army system is content with the status quo and remains small for a long time, it can also be seen that the internal contradictions in Britain are deep, and there is no determination to stand up and resist aggression.</p>
<p>In summary: In any country, changing from a mercenary system to implementing conscription is a technical issue of expanding the army, a system issue, and need not be discussed further. Whether Britain implements conscription or not can be observed in the future strength of the British army, one; observe whether Britain has the determination to participate in European affairs. The second; observe whether Britain is effective in stabilizing the situation in Europe, the third; observe the organization of the anti-aggression group, whether it is established, how strong or weak it is, the fourth; observe whether the aggressor countries are afraid of the anti-aggression group, the fifth. Because of these five points, the issue of Britain's implementation of conscription cannot be regarded as Britain's internal political issue; if conscription is implemented immediately, and the Anglo-Soviet alliance is completed as a result, then the matter is of even greater importance.</p>

<h3 id="e17">Military Affairs Committee's Battlefield Propaganda Outline <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>The Task of Propaganda (Continued from yesterday)</p>
<p>The Task and Target of Battlefield Propaganda Work According to the instructions summarized by the Minister in the discussion and resolution regarding the future work of the Political Department, the tasks of battlefield political propaganda are: (A) to initiate and expand guerrilla warfare, (B) to establish and consolidate our revolutionary regime, (C) to more strongly organize the masses behind enemy lines and compete with the enemy for the people, (D) to eliminate traitors, destroy puppet organizations, disintegrate puppet troops, and shake enemy troops, and (E) to destroy the enemy's transportation and hinder all the enemy's political, economic, and cultural facilities, so as to make the enemy exhausted and surrounded and attacked by our vast revolutionary forces, until they collapse.</p>
<p>Therefore, the targets of battlefield political propaganda can be mainly divided into the following four types: (A) officers and soldiers of regular troops and guerrilla fighters, (B) the masses behind enemy lines, (C) officers and soldiers of the enemy and puppets, and (D) prisoners of war. The supreme leader, in his instruction at the senior political work conference, earnestly pointed out the meaning of political work and the scope of its education, saying, "Political workers are the political education between the army and the people, so that they understand the political implementation of policies," and also said, "The scope of education is not limited to the troops and their subordinates, but all places where the army is stationed, with the surrounding environment, should take the army as a model and generate the function of educating the people." In the political propaganda work of the troops, naturally the officers and soldiers of the troops are the first target, and it is necessary to help the troops' training, improve discipline, improve morale, help the wounded and sick, and prevent desertion. Secondly, joining the army as soldiers and retiring as civilians are originally one body, and in fighting behind enemy lines, it is especially necessary to obtain the support and endorsement of the people. The leader's instructions pointed out that the army must become a model for the people, "generating the function of educating the people." At the same time, the Minister instructed that "cooperation between the military and the people is the only element for us to defeat the enemy, and in the enemy's rear, we must compete with the enemy for the people, so the discipline of the troops is the highest requirement of the War of Resistance." Therefore, the political propaganda work for the people behind enemy lines must be earnestly responsible by the political workers of the troops, and it is best to ensure that every soldier can become a propagandist and educator for the people. Thirdly, the battlefield is the rear of the enemy, and contact with the enemy is frequent. Not only is there an urgent need to "eliminate traitors, destroy puppet organizations, disintegrate puppet troops, and shake enemy troops" in combat, but there is also the convenience of making our propaganda against the enemy and puppets penetrate and expand in terms of propaganda technology. Therefore, the officers and soldiers of the enemy and puppets are also important targets of battlefield political propaganda work. As for the propaganda and education work of prisoners of war, if done well, it will be of great help to our propaganda against the enemy.</p>
<p>The Key Points of Propaganda</p>
<p>Yin Key Points of Battlefield Propaganda The common key points of propaganda, the content and methods of propaganda, although they cannot but vary with the different targets, also have their commonalities. In order to avoid repetition in the narrative, the common key points for more than two types of targets are listed as follows:</p>
<p>A (Mainly for Troops and the Masses) (1) According to the historical facts of the Japanese寇's invasion of China over the past sixty years, Japanese imperialism is the only enemy of the Chinese nation, so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that the enemy and us are irreconcilable, and only by driving the Japanese寇 out of China can we live a peaceful life. (2) Publicize the Prime Minister's teachings and expound the Three Principles of the People, so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that implementing the Three Principles of the People is the most correct way to complete the War of Resistance and build the nation. (3) The Third National Political Council unanimously passed a resolution requesting the government to issue an order to the military and civilians of the country to obey the great righteousness declared by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in his declaration on December 26 of last year (referring to the instructions refuting the 近卫狂妾 statement), strengthen their confidence, unify their steps, be of one heart and one mind, and complete the great cause of restoring our sovereignty and administrative integrity and completing the War of Resistance from beginning to end, and it is especially necessary to make the military and civilians behind enemy lines deeply understand it. (4) At the same time, it is necessary to prove in many ways from theory and facts the key points indicated by the supreme leader's above-mentioned instructions, so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that the policies held by the Japanese閥 are fundamentally incompatible with the survival and independence of our nation and country and the order of East Asia and world peace, deeply understand our national policy of resisting the war and building the country, and understand the various deceptive propaganda that the enemy uses as an excuse. (5) According to the supreme leader's declarations and resolutions on resisting the war and building the country, his speeches and instructions on resisting the war, clarify that our country's resistance is not only to fight for the survival of the nation and the independence of the country, but also to ensure the peace of East Asia and the world (this point should also be publicized to enemy officers and soldiers). (6) Publicize the central government's important facilities for national politics, economy, culture, etc., based on the national policy of resisting the war and building the country, as well as the government's concern and expectations for the military and civilians behind enemy lines, so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand the progress of our country in all aspects and the central government's good intentions towards them. (7) Publicize the facts and news of the unity of the country from top to bottom, the victories of our army on various battlefields, the heroic battles of the frontline soldiers, the large number of strong men in various places requesting to join the army (such as Yong'an County and Dazu County), the enthusiastic donations from people and overseas Chinese in various places, and the active participation in the War of Resistance, in order to expose the enemy's rumors, encourage the enthusiasm of the military and civilians behind enemy lines to resist the war, and strengthen their confidence in the inevitable victory of the War of Resistance. (8) Publicize the enemy's situation, especially regarding the unease in the Japanese寇's domestic politics, the decline of industry, the exhaustion of finance, the difficulties of life, the rising anti-war sentiment, the enemy soldiers' war-weariness, suicide, and anti-war rebellion (such as the enemy rebellion incidents in Dagu, Jiangyin, Guangzhou, Hankou, etc., such as the explosion of the Osaka arsenal, etc.), as well as the constant examples of the puppet army's revolt, so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that the Japanese寇's collapse is an inevitable trend. (9) Publicize the international situation, the favorable trends and news for us and the unfavorable trends and news for the enemy (such as the recent closer approach of the major democratic countries of England, America, France, and the Soviet Union, the three countries of England, America, and France denying the so-called "New Order of East Asia" by the Japanese寇 with the same note, advocating the validity of the Nine-Power Treaty, England and America's credit loans to our country, the League of Nations reiterating the resolution to condemn Japan and aid China, and the people of various countries' practical boycott of Japanese goods and the International Anti-Aggression Movement's delegates' adoption of aid to China, etc.), so that the military and civilians behind enemy lines understand that the enemy is increasingly isolated and our country's international status is increasingly improving, and deeply understand that the more we persist in the War of Resistance, the more we can lead the international situation to anti-aggression (to be continued)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) According to today's news, the Chinese side announced that the anti-British and anti-American movements instigated by the Japanese in the Japanese-occupied areas are spreading wider and wider. Recently, Anqing has even seen xenophobic sentiments, and all British goods in various stores have been searched and burned. The streets are full of British slogans. The Central Daily News commented on this matter, saying that the Japanese special service agency in Peiping allocated 500,000 yuan to subsidize the anti-British and anti-American movements and stipulated that it should be implemented immediately and engage in propaganda. It is also reported that the Japanese have drafted a plan to destroy all British and American church enterprises in China. The reason why the Japanese hate Britain and the United States so deeply is because of unfavorable battles. In the eyes of the Japanese warlords, Asia is Japan's private property, and Britain and the United States have no right to interfere. The so-called "New Order of East Asia" means that Asia belongs to Japan and Britain and the United States must withdraw. Japan believes that whether Britain and the United States aid China or not, they must withdraw. This boycott of Britain and the United States is the first voice of its "movement to expel Europeans from Asia." (Associated Press dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>Britain has sent a "frank note" to Hitler. According to British spokesmen, the content of this note is to seek peace and is also no less than a warning, because the note states that if the recent tense situation in Europe continues, it may force Britain to implement national conscription. Regarding the report that British Ambassador to Germany Henderson returned to Berlin yesterday with this note, British spokesmen have confirmed it. According to British official announcements, the content of the note includes the following points: (1) Reaffirming confidence that European problems can be resolved peacefully; (2) Suggesting that President Roosevelt's peace appeal provides an opportunity for Germany and Britain to cooperate in jointly seeking a solution to European problems. The note concluded by saying that Britain hoped that Hitler would not reject Roosevelt's proposal when responding to the US President on the 28th of this month; (3) Warning Germany that if it attempts to dominate Europe by force, Britain will resist.

<p>(London) British Ambassador to Germany Henderson will meet with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop today. A Reuters diplomatic reporter said that it is generally speculated that Henderson will take this opportunity to explain some fundamental points of British policy, such as Britain's determination to resist continued aggression, and to clearly state that Britain has no intention of encircling Germany. Britain's policy has always been a peaceful policy, but it believes that it is necessary to eliminate the dangers attached to recent events. (Reuters dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the diplomatic correspondents of the newspapers this morning, British Ambassador to Germany Henderson, who returned to his post yesterday after being back in the country for a long time, brought a frank warning to Hitler on this trip. According to the "Daily Telegraph," Henderson will declare that if Germany does not have clear evidence of changing its policy, the British government will have no choice but to continue the organization of resisting aggression and will implement national conscription. Henderson will also suggest the steps that Germany can take, such as withdrawing its troops in Spain and demobilizing part of its mobilized troops at home. The reporter of the newspaper also said that Henderson will also tell that the British government is willing to use practical and peaceful consultation methods to resolve various outstanding issues, so the British government fully agrees with the position taken by President Roosevelt in his telegram to Germany and Italy, which has been clearly expressed in the dispatches repeatedly sent to Washington from London. "Daily Express" said that Henderson has asked Hitler for a personal meeting and believes that Henderson will strongly advocate the wisdom of accepting the ten-year or twenty-five-year peace plan proposed by the US President. The conclusion of Henderson's direct advice will be a frank warning, that is, if President Roosevelt's proposal is rejected, it will inevitably cause a tense international situation and the most negative repercussions in the world, especially in Britain. The "Daily Mail" also recorded this last point, "briefly stating" that Henderson will strongly argue that if the US President's appeal is rejected, it may increase international tensions to the point of breaking down. The diplomatic correspondent of "The Times" also mentioned Henderson's return to his post and Prime Minister Chamberlain's brief remarks on the matter in the House of Commons, saying that the government will firmly support both the warning and the opportunity given in President Roosevelt's telegram. In short, Henderson's return to his post will show that the government's policy has not changed, nor has it softened. This can be seen in the situation of domestic and overseas contacts in China in the past few weeks. British government officials are still unwilling to publish any instructions given to Henderson, but according to Reuters' diplomatic reporters, the British government seems to have given Henderson instructions.

<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull said today that British Ambassador to Berlin Henderson's return to his post is something the US Ambassador does not want to follow. Officials here reiterated that they believed that President Roosevelt did not want to make any decisions regarding the US Ambassador's return to Germany before receiving Hitler's reply to his peace appeal telegram. The press and diplomatic circles here have received news that Hitler may try to reverse the order of President Roosevelt's suggestions, arguing that Germany must first obtain satisfactory economic and colonial demands before giving guarantees regarding its future intentions. News reaching Washington said that Hitler might try to revive the "appeasement policy" and point out that President Roosevelt's telegram is sufficient to prove the legitimacy of this action. All political circles here are aware that President Roosevelt does not want to be drawn into a trap in this matter, because those who have loudly opposed the "appeasement policy" so far are the supporters of President Roosevelt, and President Roosevelt, for internal political reasons, cannot apply for unilateral concessions from Britain and France to appease the Axis powers. The opinions revealed by the newspapers here, many believe, are from official instructions, saying that the "appeasement policy" is still in progress, but the United States cannot remain indifferent and oppose the suggestion of ceding West African land to the Axis powers, because this area is easy to extend its influence to reach South America. Some African federations are deeply afraid of being controlled by the Axis powers and have sought refuge in the United States, as can be seen in the recent actions of the Liberian Americans. They even called for the protection of the United States to resist the Nuremberg racial laws. Therefore, although the US government has not formally declared that it is not interested in the land issue, there are still some areas behind it, which are clearly becoming a negotiation issue that does not disturb the US government. Therefore, the general opinion is that Washington seems to formally insist on an accurate interpretation of President Roosevelt's suggestions. (Reuters dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>Regarding Economics: Britain will extend commercial loans to Romania to promote trade with Britain without increasing trade with Germany. However, Britain has no intention of granting a formal loan to the country, but will provide various facilities through the Treasury to enable Romania to sell its grains and other foodstuffs on the British market, and to use the proceeds to repay the commercial loans. The detailed plan will be finalized by Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the government's economic advisor, in the Romanian capital with the Romanian authorities.</p>
<p>Regarding Politics: The two main issues discussed by British and Romanian cabinet members were: first, the issue of Soviet cooperation in the event of future war; and second, the issue of mutual assistance between Poland and Romania. It is reported that Foreign Minister Gafencu still opposes Soviet troops passing through Romanian territory, and insists that Soviet cooperation should be limited to air force assistance and arms supplies.

For annual incomes within the limit of £8,000, a surtax of £5 per £100 will be levied; for those above £8,000, a surtax of £10 per £100 will be levied. The tobacco tax will increase from two shillings to eleven shillings and sixpence per pound, and the sugar tax will increase by one-quarter of a penny per pound. Death duties will increase by 10% for estates valued at £50,000 or more. The Chancellor also stated that the film tax is expected to collect £1 million in a full year. The motor vehicle horsepower tax will increase from fifteen shillings to one pound and five shillings from January 1st. The tax rate for motorcycles will also be changed. The Chancellor continued that £20,000,000 of the deficit must be covered by tax revenue. Taxpayers must pay £942,000,000, and £380,000,000 must be raised through borrowing. The Chancellor also announced that the stamp duty on medicines would be abolished from September, and the tax on theaters and entertainment would be slightly reduced.</p>
<p>The House of Commons was very crowded today. The Chancellor rose at 3:45 PM to announce the budget, and everyone listened quietly. Before the announcement, several members raised questions, but the noise was so loud that they could not be heard. When the Chancellor spoke, there was a great cheer throughout the hall. The Chancellor first mentioned that when Gladstone was in power, the total amount of his first of thirteen proposed budgets was £53,000,000. The current budget has increased more than twentyfold compared to Gladstone's proposal to abolish income tax in 1853. The Chancellor made this statement to ease the atmosphere of the House, because at that time, the public did not yet know the contents of the budget he was about to propose. The Chancellor continued that income tax revenue was less than the estimated amount, but the surtax on income has exceeded the previous year's estimate. He felt that the increase in revenue was due to the effectiveness of the plan to prevent tax evasion. Last year, £20,000,000 was allocated to repay the national debt. The Exchange Equalization Fund continued to generate favorable profits. He intends to set the amount of debt repayment at £230,000,000, and if necessary, he can issue bonds to fill the statutory fund. The Chancellor finished his speech at 5:05 PM and sat down, having stood for eighty minutes.</p>
<h3 id="e38">Overview of This Year's Budget <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>The tax revenue for this year's budget is £927,250,000, a decrease of £17,500,000 compared to the estimated amount, but an increase of £45,000,000 compared to the figures for 1937 to 1938. The total gross amount of various national defense expenditures, including air defense, is nearly £400,000,000. The previous year was £265,500,000. The total expenditure for the Debt Redemption Fund for 1939 to 1940 is £247,000,000, an increase of £5,000,000. The most serious and urgent problem is the additional national defense expenditure, which is also the main point of discussion in this year's budget. The estimated expenditure for supply affairs is £675,000,000. The estimated expenditure for air defense this year is £42,000,000. The total amount of expenditures to be paid from tax revenue is £922,400,000. This figure does not include additional national defense expenditure. The net total amount of the national debt has increased from £8,026,000,000 last year to £8,163,000,000. The total amount of tax revenue estimated based on the existing tax base is £918,331,000. The amount allocated from this fund for national defense this year is £223,500,000. The original amount to be allocated from tax revenue was £130,000,000. However, the original figure for national defense expenditure for this year was £580,000,000 (£350,000,000 of which was allocated from borrowing, and £230,000,000 was paid from tax revenue). It has increased in all aspects to £630,000,000, and may continue to increase. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e39">The Issue of Britain Implementing Conscription: Heated Debate Among Various Factions, Labor Party Leader Explains Reasons for Opposition, Practical Difficulties Cannot Be Ignored <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>(London) The opposition Labor Party held a closed-door meeting this afternoon to discuss the issue of conscription, and it is reported that it still expressed its opposition. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Opposition Labor Party leader Major Attlee published an article in the Liberal Party's "Star Evening News" today, stating, "Our party firmly opposes conscription, and its attitude has always been consistent." Even if this system is implemented, it will not be effective until several years later. Moreover, since the government implemented the National Volunteer Service system, the results have been very satisfactory. Why bother with this? "Furthermore, if conscription is implemented, it is likely to cause internal friction, which may affect national morale." Labor Party members commented on Attlee's article, saying that this is not the party stubbornly adhering to its views and opposing the compulsory service system. Any plan should still be studied at any time to determine its direction. In other words, the party does not oppose it in principle, but practical difficulties must be taken into account, such as the lack of manpower in industry and commerce, and the insufficient allocation of armaments, all of which should be considered in advance. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of implementing conscription, The Times recently analyzed the opinions of the government parties and the opposition parties, saying, "The government parties seem to have a strong argument for establishing the principle of compulsory military service. Most of them originally firmly believed that the current National Volunteer Service system is most suitable for Britain. Now they have also reached a conclusion that Britain, under the current circumstances, is the same as during the last European War and should abandon this traditional policy, thereby calling on the people of the whole country to make greater efforts to firmly support the current foreign policy. However, the government had previously provided assurances that Britain would not implement conscription in peacetime. This point cannot be ignored, but those who support the implementation of conscription say that since the government made this assurance, Britain's military commitments to various countries have increased dramatically, and the international situation is so tense that it cannot be regarded as peacetime. However, opponents such as the leaders of the Labor Party still insist that it is impossible. As for whether the members of the opposition party also take an opposing attitude, it cannot be generalized, and in the event of necessity, there may be dramatic changes in everyone's opinions, which is also reasonable."

<p>(London) Well-informed political figures here have declared that German leader Hitler has reportedly decided to demand the annexation of the Free City of Danzig and the return of old colonies. When he delivers his speech on the 28th of this month, he will explain that this demand does not conflict with the telegram sent by US President Roosevelt, because Danzig was not originally owned by Poland, and Germany's old colonies were only mandated territories of various countries, which are different from formally affiliated territories. Germany's recovery of them cannot be said to be an invasion of other countries' territories. However, it is generally believed that regarding the Danzig issue, there is still a possibility for Germany and Poland to establish a friendly solution directly at the last hour. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Free City of Danzig: It is rumored that the leader of the National Socialist German Workers' Party in this city, Forster, gave a speech at a labor rally somewhere, saying that leader Hitler has promised to return this city to Germany within this year.

<h3 id="e45">170,000 People in New York Sign Petition Requesting Assistance to China's Sacred War of Resistance: Mrs. Fitch Advocates Economic Sanctions Against Japan and Fully Supports Pittman's New Neutrality Bill <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Mrs. Fitch, who resided in China for twenty years and is now the leader of the California China Relief Association, reported to the House Foreign Affairs Committee today that she is convinced that China will eventually win the Sino-Japanese War. The proposed amendment to the Neutrality Act by Pittman, in our psychological imagination, is more harmful than beneficial to China. However, we think from another perspective that if this measure is implemented, then we will not have any goods shipped to Japan, and Japan will have no goods shipped to the United States. This measure will certainly end the Sino-Japanese War sooner. Mrs. Fitch then urged the US government to take action quickly to sanction aggressive countries. She said that if Congress is unwilling to do so, then she would rather support Pittman's proposal, but the Far Eastern issue should be dealt with separately and not confused with the whole. She believes that if the United States can economically sanction Japan, the United States will not be in danger of being dragged into the vortex of war, but if the United States still does not stop fueling the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis, then it may be dragged into the vortex of war. Mrs. Fitch further requested the House Foreign Affairs Committee to request assistance to China's sacred war of resistance. She said that people in New York have submitted a request to the government for assistance to China, and at that time, 175,000 people signed it. The Foreign Affairs Committee unanimously expressed its approval after listening to Mrs. Fitch's report. Illinois Democrat Ellen asked Mrs. Fitch, "If the United States refuses to sell gasoline, pig iron, and other military supplies to Japan, will Japan buy goods from the Dutch East Indies and other places?" Mrs. Fitch replied, "Japan's economic position is now extremely dangerous and it can no longer obtain credit loans in any country." (Associated Press dispatch, 25th)</p>

Under this situation, Japan must earnestly carry out the anti-communist war.

<h3 id="e50">Amidst European Tensions, Hong Kong Strengthens Military Preparations: Army, Navy, and Air Force Actively Expand Outer Defenses and Construct Fortifications <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>A Hong Kong dispatch reports that, given the recent tensions in Europe, Hong Kong, as a British territory, will inevitably be drawn into the conflict should a European war break out. Although the British government, in its effort to protect its territories, built the Singapore Naval Base years ago and deployed the Far East Fleet in the Pacific to provide remote support, Hong Kong's limited territory means its local defense capabilities are only now being organized. Moreover, the distance to the Singapore Naval Base by sea is quite far. This small island, while commercially a major hub in the Far East, has historically had minimal military defenses. Recently, with the expansion of Japanese influence into Hainan Island and the Spratly Islands, the British Far East shipping lanes are under increasing threat, and Hong Kong is imperceptibly within its sphere of influence. In response, the Hong Kong government is urgently expanding its self-defense capabilities. Recently, no effort has been spared in training local air forces, organizing air defenses, supplying the navy, and fortifying the army along the Kowloon border. Hong Kong Island relies on the navy for outer perimeter defense, while the island's gun emplacements have been strengthened. Defensive fortifications have also been increased along the Kowloon border. Over the past few months, new-style fortifications have been built near the terminus of the British section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway. Key intersections are being fortified with barbed wire. From Shenzhen to Tai Po and Sha Tin stations, the fortifications along major roads and minor paths are largely complete. The British section of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway is the only transportation lifeline connecting British Kowloon to the occupied areas of the mainland. Therefore, the Hong Kong government is paying close attention to the land defenses along this route.</p>
<p>Since its exercises in Singapore, the British Far East Fleet has reorganized its Far East defenses. British warships stationed in Hong Kong waters have successively returned to defend, totaling more than twenty ships. One aircraft carrier is stationed, and recently two shallow-draft gunboats, named Flying Dragon and Mantis, have arrived in Hong Kong. Each boat weighs 585 tons. In addition, there is one coastal defense ship, making the force stronger than before. To facilitate the British Navy's supply needs in Hong Kong, the British government has issued the Hong Kong Naval Volunteer Ordinance from London. The ordinance stipulates that the British Admiralty can directly accept warships maintained at the Hong Kong government's expense. If warships are jointly maintained with other colonies, the latter's consent is required. Whether serving at sea or on land, within or outside Hong Kong, volunteer officers and soldiers must comply with the regulations temporarily in force for the strict enforcement of naval discipline. The volunteer corps can be assigned to any warship, agency, or other place outside Hong Kong for service and training. In times of emergency, they can join naval service, be incorporated into the naval reserve or the naval volunteer reserve, or a portion can be incorporated into the naval reserve and a portion into the naval volunteer reserve. The British Admiralty can assist the Hong Kong government in dispatching officers and soldiers to naval service.</p>
<p>Recently, the Hong Kong Air Force has also been approved by the British government to conduct its own training. The training is based on the original Far East Aviation School. To date, the school has produced many talented pilots, some of whom will serve locally. The British Air Ministry also plans to strengthen Hong Kong's air defenses, with the Air Ministry transferring several squadrons of first-line aircraft for permanent stationing in Hong Kong. Aircraft replacements will be supplied by Australian and British aircraft factories. Air defense facilities in Hong Kong and Kowloon have recently been implemented separately. Anti-aircraft guns are being deployed at strategically important points, and the surrounding defensive fortifications are also being completed successively. Hong Kong and Kowloon have been divided into 22 air defense zones. An air raid shelter is being planned and built on the newly reclaimed land in Wan Chai so that residents can have a place of refuge in case of emergency. Each air defense zone is training residents to form air defense teams. The organization of air defense teams is divided into rescue teams, decontamination teams, police teams, transportation teams, fire brigades, and air defense observers. Air raid sirens have been installed in suitable areas. Recently, seven new ones were purchased and are being installed in residential areas. Several blackout drills were conducted last month, and a drill will be held soon without prior notice. Residents must turn off their lights as soon as they hear the air raid siren, and public streetlights must also be automatically controlled. When the all-clear signal is issued, the city's lights will return to normal. (April 19)</p>
<h3 id="e51">Chinese Army Counterattacks Between Jiangsu and Shandong, Transitioning to an Epoch-Making Situation: Strong Military Force, Officers, and Soldiers Enthusiastically Following Orders, Adopting a Unified Stance to Launch Mobile Warfare <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Taixian reports that since the arrival of a fresh Chinese force in the Jiangsu-Shandong war zone earlier this month, together with the original armies, the military strength has increased significantly. After consultations between senior generals, the various units were reorganized, and soon, a stable deployment was achieved. In accordance with the central government's designated strategy, a general counteroffensive has begun throughout the country. Southern Shandong and Northern Jiangsu are adopting a unified stance, launching large-scale mobile warfare. All heroic soldiers and armed civilians are enthusiastically following orders in this great spring, vowing to kill the enemy to the death. In just a few days, they have achieved glorious results that break records. The recent combat situation on various lines in Jiangsu Province is described below.</p>
<p>Creating an Enemy in Southern Shandong</p>
<p>When a fresh Chinese army began to move towards the Jiangsu-Shandong border, the Japanese army felt threatened and also increased its troops from Jiaodong to invade southward, attempting to strike first. However, the Chinese armies, having experienced many battles, have built strong defensive fortifications in the southern Shandong area. At the same time, they are also conducting guerrilla warfare in support. Therefore, as soon as the two armies came into contact, the Japanese army was defeated one by one. More than 2,000 Japanese and puppet troops led by Zhang Yun initially invaded west from Zhucheng. In the Zhigou area, they were attacked day and night by the Chinese army and were utterly defeated. The Japanese and puppet troops suffered about a hundred casualties, and the Chinese army captured forty or fifty Japanese and puppet officers and soldiers, dozens of mules and horses, and a large number of infantry guns, artillery, and ammunition. The remaining Japanese and puppet troops fled back to Zhucheng in disarray. The Chinese army took advantage of the victory and pursued them, and has now surrounded Zhucheng, preparing to annihilate them. In the Anqiu area, the Japanese army increased its troops to invade southward. In the Linwu, Shibu, and Shenliuzhuang areas, they also encountered a head-on blow from a large Chinese army. After a fierce battle for half a day, many Japanese soldiers were killed, and their corpses littered the field. The Japanese army's morale was low, and they retreated in defeat. On the 5th, the Japanese army reinforced with two or three hundred infantry and artillery soldiers, covered by eight vehicles, to counterattack. After the Chinese army confronted them and attacked from the flanks, they suffered another heavy blow and collapsed towards Fushan and retreated to Linqu. The Japanese army invading south also attacked Jiangyu, where they were severely attacked by the Chinese army. Although the Japanese army continued to reinforce, they attacked Daguan again. The Chinese army then launched a surprise attack, attacking from three sides. The battle was fierce, and the Chinese army followed one another and fought fiercely in hand-to-hand combat. The Japanese army could not withstand it and began to collapse across the board. The bodies of the dead were piled up, and the Chinese army seized military supplies that could not be counted. The Japanese army in Lintan also moved south and encountered a strong Chinese force, suffering heavy losses and unable to invade south. They have now been monitored and surrounded by the Chinese army and are about to be annihilated. The Chinese army in southern Shandong is now divided into various important strategic areas and defends the mountains and highways. In addition, the folk customs of southern Shandong are tough, and the Red Spear Society and the People's Anti-Japanese Self-Defense Corps are everywhere. Shen Honglie, chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, has also established the governments of eight counties in southern Shandong separately. Commissioners and county heads are working hard to mobilize the masses to cooperate with the regular army and participate in the war of resistance. Therefore, the combat achievements in this area have gradually restored the glorious continuation of the great battle of southern Shandong last year.</p>
<p>Combat Situation in Huaibei</p>
<p>Since the entry of a strong Chinese force into Huaibei at the end of last month, it has coordinated with the standing teams and people's self-defense corps in various counties, and constantly engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese and puppets. In particular, in the area of Huishu, Gaogou, and Tanggou in Lianshui County, the fierce battles with the Japanese and puppets were the most intense. They killed a large number of stubborn enemies, and then covered the masses to destroy the Huaihai, Zhenghai, and Huaixu highways, making it impossible for the Japanese army's heavy weapons to travel. At the same time, Wang Huayun, the county head of Pixian, led the standing team and self-defense corps to recover Pixian County twice, killing twenty or thirty Japanese and puppets, capturing many prisoners, and seizing dozens of long and short guns and other military supplies and horses. Wang Dianhua, the county head of Siyang, supervised the standing team and self-defense corps, and organized thousands of armed civilians to engage in fierce battles with the Japanese and puppets many times in the area of Shijiazhuang, Zhuangjiatan, and Lujiazui on the north bank of Hongze Lake. They used the lake swamp area to launch guerrilla tactics, and the Japanese and puppet heavy weapons were unable to move. They were unable to take care of each other, and their communication was repeatedly cut off. Therefore, the Japanese and puppet casualties were particularly heavy, and the Japanese captain Suzuki Saburo was killed, and a poison gas cannon and other military equipment were seized. The remaining Japanese and puppet troops retreated to Siyang and dared not go out again. County head Wang has reorganized his troops and presented them for approval to incorporate the armed civilians into the regular army, making the anti-war armed forces more substantial. Recently, he has counterattacked Siyang, approaching the suburbs. Lu Tongxuan, the county head of Suqian, has also established close contact with County head Wang, supervising his troops to counterattack Suqian, and destroying the Su-Si, Su-Shu, and Su-Sui highways, making it impossible for the Japanese and puppets to establish contact. Zhu Aizhou, the county head of Ganyu, has also organized his county's standing team and established a joint strike with the main army of southern Shandong. He is also launching a guerrilla war against the Japanese and puppets.</p>
<p>Attacking Lianghuai</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the month, the Chinese army attacking Lianghuai has moved to the suburbs of Huai. There are often five or six hundred to a thousand Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Huaiyin City, and they are often rotated. There are about five or six hundred Japanese soldiers in Huai'an. The city has a large outline and very high walls. The Japanese army has erected cannons and machine guns at various gates, and the defense is quite strict. In the initial attack, the Chinese army approached the west gate of Huaiyin and climbed the city with cloud ladders. The Japanese army used its fierce artillery fire to exert strong pressure and failed to break through. Later, the Chinese army recovered Banzha between Huai'an and Huaiyin, destroyed the highway, and cut off the Japanese army's communication. The Japanese army in Lianghuai stubbornly defended the isolated city and dared not go out. The Chinese army then attacked several times, and the Japanese army resisted stubbornly. The Chinese army then bombarded the city with artillery fire and destroyed the power plant. The Japanese army still stubbornly refused to fight. The Chinese army then cut off the highways around Huai, making it impossible for them to pass heavy weapons and unable to get reinforcements. Huaiyin is also under the close surveillance of the Chinese army. The Chinese army is openly active in the suburbs, and the Japanese army does not dare to leave the city a step.</p>
<p>Recovering Haimen</p>
<p>The various units in the Nantong Haimen area launched a general counteroffensive this week, starting simultaneously on the 12th from Jijiashi in the west to Qinglonggang in Qidong County in the east. The officers and soldiers were brave and their morale was extremely high. After only one or two nights of fierce fighting with the Japanese army, they successively recovered Jiangzaogang, Bachang, Qinglonggang, and Zhangzhizhen, and annihilated all the Japanese troops in the Dasheng Yarn Factory. The factory's machinery was also destroyed to prevent it from being used by the enemy again. At that time, the Japanese army generally retreated to Haimen Middle School in the northeast corner of the county seat, and one group retreated to Haimen City (the county has no city walls). The Chinese army attacked repeatedly for three consecutive nights on the 14th, 15th, and 16th, and officially recovered Haimen County on the 16th of this month. The remaining Japanese troops fled in panic. The Chinese army killed more than two hundred enemies and captured thirty or forty alive. The military supplies seized were piled up like mountains. On the same day, they also recovered Huidili (outside the south gate of Nantong). When the news of the Chinese army's victory reached the various lines, the morale of the army was even more excited, and they counterattacked the Japanese army. The momentum was like a broken bamboo. As for Rugao, the Chinese army's counterattack successively recovered Shizhuangzhen, Xinshenggang, and Niantuogang (all south of Rugao City), which are important strongholds. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, and the bodies of the dead littered the field. Rugao County is also surrounded by the Chinese army. As for the Japanese army in the Yangzhou-Shao area along the canal line, they are constantly attacked by the Chinese army, like startled birds. The Chinese army's positions on various lines are becoming more and more stable. In short, the war situation in northern Jiangsu has recently entered a new stage of dramatic times.</p>
<h3 id="e52">The Zhengjin Bank in Guangzhou Was Robbed: The Result of the Japanese Army's Indiscriminate Support of Bandits; Bandits Killed a Bank Employee <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Hong Kong reports that after the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou, it worked hard to search for gold, silver, and jewelry, oppress the people, and shelter gambling and drug trafficking. They were indifferent to local security, so the banditry in the urban area, although rampant, was ignored. Therefore, the bandit forces were cultivated in a formless way and gradually expanded. More than a dozen cases of robbery occur every day, and the entire city is almost a world of bandits. However, with the bandit forces flourishing, it is not only a scourge for the citizens, but also the Japanese are encountering its harm. For example, the robbery of the Guangzhou branch of Yokohama Zhengjin Bank is a manifestation of this. The Guangzhou branch of Yokohama Zhengjin Bank is located at 25 Xihaokou, the original site of the Jiaotong Bank. It specializes in absorbing the financial resources of the occupied areas as its only task. On the morning of the 10th of this month, at about 1:00 a.m., the bank was suddenly robbed by eight bandits who broke open the iron gate and entered the bank. After entering the bank, the bandits immediately frightened the bank employees into a corner. They then tilted the cabinets and overturned the boxes. At that time, a bank employee ran down from upstairs and drew his weapon to resist the bandits, but was shot dead by the bandits. The bandits searched for half an hour before escaping with their loot. Afterwards, a large Japanese army rushed to the scene, but the bandits had already disappeared without a trace. After the bank was robbed, the Japanese army headquarters sent twenty Japanese soldiers to guard it. The bank was closed for one day to investigate the losses from the robbery, but the amount robbed has not been officially announced.</p>

<h3 id="e53">Current Status of National Primary Education: 320,000 Schools with 18 Million Students Before the War; Textbooks and Teaching Materials Have Been Revised and Recompiled After the War, and Other Matters Are Continuing <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education recently compiled detailed statistics on national primary education (including kindergartens, primary schools' higher and lower departments, simplified primary schools, and short-term primary schools) before and after the war. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Pre-War Situation: National Primary Education in the 25th Year Before the War (1) "Number of Schools": 1,283 kindergartens (872 public, 411 private), 244,398 primary schools (208,777 public, 35,621 private), 39,034 primary schools with both higher and lower grades (30,064 public, 8,970 private), 6,704 simplified primary schools (6,564 public, 140 private), 28,661 short-term primary schools (28,253 public, 408 private), totaling 320,080 schools. (2) "Number of Classes": A total of 559,534 classes in all kindergartens and schools (464,867 public). (3) "Number of Children": 79,827 in kindergartens, 11,179,998 in primary schools, 1,444,700 in the lower grades of higher and lower grades combined, 3,657,070 in the higher grades, 175,590 in simplified primary schools, and 182,777 in short-term primary schools, totaling 18,364,956 people (15,607,312 public), of which 3,548,878 were girls. (4) "Number of Teachers and Staff": 2,607 in kindergartens, 453,073 in primary schools, 196,624 in schools with both higher and lower grades, 8,023 in simplified primary schools, and 42,504 in short-term primary schools, totaling 702,831, of which 55,280 were women. (5) "Annual Expenditure": 1,091,459 for kindergartens, 53,205,42 for primary schools, 34,014,900 for the higher grades of schools with both higher and lower grades, 24,675,507 for the lower grades, 771,166 for simplified primary schools, and 5,967,160 yuan for short-term primary schools, totaling 119,725,603 yuan (94,718,339 public).</p>
<p>Post-War Status: The Ministry of Education is currently compiling the general situation of primary education in various provinces and cities after the war and has not yet completed the statistics. Regarding the primary school teachers and staff who withdrew from the battlefield, in addition to distributing 6,790 people to 11 provinces and 13 locations and placing 280 people in other educational institutions, 69 people were examined and employed as teachers and editors, and 1,402 people were assigned to serve in the middle and primary school teacher service corps in 8 locations. As for the primary education facilities of the Ministry of Education, several points can be mentioned:</p>
<p>(1) "Curriculum": Although the Ministry of Education has repeatedly promulgated the curriculum standards for primary schools and kindergartens, from temporary to revised, it has been seven years. There is no unchanging law in the world, and curriculum standards are not the same as the curriculum, but the standard that the curriculum can be based on. Therefore, concrete curricula still need to be compiled separately by the central and local governments. Those that are national in scope and can be used nationwide are compiled by the central government, and those that are local in scope and can be used specifically by each province, city, and county are compiled by the local government. Before the war, the Ministry of Education ordered various provinces and cities to formulate concrete curriculum examples, but unfortunately, only Jiangsu and other provinces compiled a part, which was not completed. Most of the provinces did not submit their papers. The Ministry of Education designated specialists to try to formulate a national concrete curriculum, but since the fall of Nanjing, the manuscripts were not taken out, resulting in loss. The Ministry of Education is still working on this task and hopes to continue to complete it.</p>
<p>(2) "Textbooks and Teaching Materials": (A) Review of textbooks: Since the revised curriculum standards, the books sent to the Ministry and transferred to the National Compilation and Translation Bureau by various bookstores have been revised and reviewed. Due to the current situation, this revision and review work has not been fully completed. (B) Editing of textbooks: Since the Ministry of Education specially assigned editors to compile more perfect primary school textbooks, before that, nine kinds of drafts had been completed for junior primary school Chinese, arithmetic, society, and nature, and senior primary school Chinese, arithmetic, history, geography, and nature. Later, a committee was formed to submit the usable drafts to the Compilation and Translation Bureau for review and revision. Those that were not usable were re-edited by experts. Before August 26, only the entire senior primary school Chinese, two volumes of junior primary school Chinese, one volume each of junior and senior primary school arithmetic, and one volume of senior primary school society were published. In the 27th year, the committee was reorganized, the policy was re-established, the completed drafts were revised or re-edited, and those that had not been completed were re-edited. Currently, most of the textbooks published by various bookstores do not meet the needs of the war of resistance, so supplementary teaching materials should be added, and editing has begun. (C) Sorting out other reading materials: Before, more than 2,000 books that could be read by primary school children were selected, divided into upper, middle, and lower grades. A children's book exhibition was held in Beijing, and it was planned to tour the provinces, but it was not sorted out, and the Children's Year Implementation Committee was closed. This will continue to be sorted out in the future. (D) Sorting out and editing music teaching materials: Before, three volumes of primary school music teaching materials were published, for use in the lower, middle, and upper grades of primary schools. Recently, the Music Committee was reorganized to actively engage in the compilation of music teaching materials for middle and primary schools. (E) Editing and revising textbooks for short-term primary schools: The results of the discussion at the Yi Education Cadre Training Class in the 25th year showed that the textbooks for short-term primary schools compiled in the 22nd year were mostly not applicable, so a new version was revised in May of the 26th year and completed in October. The content mixed and compiled Chinese and common sense. Common sense only had charts and no textbooks for reference when teaching. Chinese had both text and pictures, and strived to connect with common sense. It has now been published by major bookstores.</p>
<p>(3) "Moral Education": (A) In July of the 25th year, the primary school civic training standards were revised and promulgated, and all primary schools in the country can implement them accordingly. (B) Abolishing corporal punishment and removing all restrictions: Recently, previous orders have been reiterated and notified to be followed. (C) Paying attention to physical education and hygiene: Various implementation plans have been issued, and primary schools have been ordered to pay attention to increasing children's sleep time, wearing masks when sweeping the floor, and not assigning them to dangerous tasks such as emptying spittoons. The schools have also been ordered to pay attention to extracurricular sports, stipulating that there should be group activities and individual free activities every day, as well as morning exercises and interval exercises. (D) Promoting family education (methods will be published in this newspaper): The teaching materials for family education have now been compiled by the Ministry and will be distributed to the country soon.</p>
<p>(4) "Equipment": No standards have been set for school buildings, desks, chairs, and all equipment. However, there are regulations for teaching equipment, such as the equipment for the labor science department. There are also detailed regulations on school hygiene equipment. In the future, it is planned to pay special attention to this aspect of work.</p>
<p>(5) "Teachers and Staff": (A) In addition to stipulating the qualifications, treatment, and protection of primary school teachers and staff, the regulations on the examination of primary school teachers were revised and promulgated in December of the 25th year to rectify the teaching staff. (B) For the further study of primary school teachers and staff, the summer seminars in the 27th year focused on education laws and regulations, and in the 28th year, it is planned to focus on the implementation of education for the war of resistance. In addition, normal universities and education colleges of various universities are ordered to set up special primary school teacher auditing seats to facilitate further study. Normal universities and education colleges of various universities, and provincial and municipal departments and bureaus are first ordered to designate excellent normal schools and affiliated primary schools to run primary school teacher correspondence research offices, as institutions for further study and consultation for primary schools and kindergartens in various places.</p>
<p>(6) "Guidance and Research": Before, the Ministry proposed various research questions on curriculum, teaching equipment, education administration, etc., and issued orders for research. In the summer of the 26th year, the Ministry, based on the current education laws and regulations that primary schools across the country have not been able to fully comply with and implement, proposed 54 questions, pointed out the provisions of the laws and regulations one by one, and the points that should be paid attention to during the inspection, and compiled a handbook, which was distributed to various inspectors as a comparison book for inspecting primary schools. At the same time, it was also issued to various schools for reference and improvement. (In addition, there are various matters related to the Children's Year, and the relief of teachers and staff and refugee children, which are omitted.)</p>
<h3 id="e54">Rugao Normal School Moves to Piancha: Full of Vigor; Utilizing a Special Environment to Strictly Train Young People <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Dispatch from Dongtai) Rugao Normal School was originally located at Maojiaqiao in Rugao City. After Principal Huang left the school in November of the 16th year, the school was suspended and no one was in charge. In February of the 27th year, the Department of Education ordered Jiang Yixuan, the school's director of teaching affairs, to return to the school to act as the principal and ordered him to prepare for the resumption of classes. Therefore, the school re-recruited students to attend classes on March 1 of last year. Unexpectedly, Rugao fell on March 19, and the students were dismissed and returned home. At that time, the school's accountant, Xu Chengyuan, returned to Ruian, Zhejiang, and the economy could not function, resulting in repeated decisions to plan the resumption of classes but it was impossible. Until October of last year, Jiang ran around Shanghai and Huai, and the Department of Education specially found a way to resolve the difficulties and decided to move the school to Piancha Town in the normal school district, first restoring a part of the junior high school, registering students on one hand, and procuring various school equipment on the other. Classes began on February 25 of this year, and student registration procedures were handled, and classes began on March 1. Jiang has more than ten years of experience serving in provincial schools in Jiangsu and Anhui, and utilizes the existing special environment to train students to become talents suitable for current needs. He is extremely strict with education and management, so although the resumption time is short, the results are already considerable. Recently, Zhang Yi, a senior official of Jiangsu Province, passed through the town and visited the school. He believed that the school was able to maintain its original career with very little funding and had achieved such results, which was quite interesting. He then expressed to Jiang that he was very happy to support the school in terms of materials and spirit. It is now heard that the school plans to set up a senior high school department in the next semester, which is truly good news for young people in northern Jiangsu who have lost their senior high school education.</p>

<p>In our lives, reason is naturally very precious. A child makes many bad things because they lack reason. As long as his parents, who are responsible for education, try to cultivate his reason, bad behaviors will be reduced. However, an adult, in addition to needing reason, also needs love. If he is too rational, he will become a cold person, and people who encounter him will inevitably be criticized for being eccentric! This kind of person lacks some emotions, but he still needs love. Because love is enough to nourish him, encourage him, and beautify and fulfill the content of his life. Therefore, Westerners say: "A happy life must be led by reason and encouraged by love." This is not bad at all.</p>
<p>We only need to look at a man who has lost love. He will feel how disheartened, how dull and lonely his life is. He is simply bored with everything, and sometimes he even commits suicide because of this! Indeed, love is an indispensable element in our lives. Without love, there can be no happy life. This is why young men and women regard love as a second life. However, love is not a rare treasure, but a common occurrence. Once an energetic and strong man marries a healthy and beautiful woman, they will surely have deep love and be happier than flying. They will give birth to clever children and form a happy family. Isn't this very common? Why should a dignified man be abandoned by a woman and fall into the miserable situation of unrequited love? Although there are many reasons for this, most of them must be due to the man's early self-gratification and nocturnal emission or post-marital debauchery and excessive indulgence and worrying labor. In terms of innate function, spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin sperm infertility, neurasthenia, and other symptoms erupt, then he is both sallow and thin, and his appearance is not attractive and cannot arouse women's love. Even in marital life, it will inevitably be unsatisfactory, hated by his wife, and even past love will be destroyed once. Therefore, all kinds of tragedies are staged in the family, then how miserable will his life be!</p>
<p>Smart husbands who want to remedy the situation must fundamentally cure their diseases. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking the gonadotropin preparation "Shengzhisu" is the most effective treatment. Because this agent can produce sperm to nourish the kidneys, invigorate the brain and activate blood, and nourish the nerves after taking it for one day and night, and if you continue to take it, it will definitely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and it can also prolong life and rejuvenate. Only those with nocturnal emission need to take "Himitotsu Spermostatic Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gate and prevent leakage, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the effect will be quick. If patients can come to this clinic in person and be diagnosed by expert doctors, and use various scientific therapies such as electrotherapy, injection, and surgery, they can be guaranteed to be cured.</p>
<h3 id="e70">Nocturnal Emission and Self-Gratification are No Different from Severing One's Own Vitality <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Who among the young people who are in the city full of sexual temptation can not be moved by it? The fear of venereal disease viruses makes him not have the courage to prostitute, but the sexual depression is unbearable, so he has to settle for masturbation. It is so pitiful to say! But once masturbation is committed, it is easy to develop bad habits and indulge in it. Over time, the sperm gate is loosened, and sometimes you have a nocturnal emission while dreaming of romance, and sometimes unconsciously, or when you see a woman's color, or when the local area is accidentally in contact with clothes and pants, you have lewd thoughts, and there is seminal fluid leaking out. Day after day, the source of life flows outward, how can your flesh and blood body not be exhausted and give birth to all kinds of diseases. Therefore, symptoms such as mental weakness, insomnia, forgetfulness, headache, flatulence, low ambition, difficulty in thinking, back pain, kidney deficiency, and scattered energy are successively followed. Not only are these young people unsuccessful in academics and careers because of multiple illnesses and pains, but they are also impoverished for life. They will inevitably be unsatisfactory in the marital life that is indispensable in life, hated by their wives, and all kinds of tragedies will be staged in the family, or there will be no children, causing lifelong regrets! In addition, there are many cases of premature aging and early death due to the exhaustion of vitality!</p>
<p>The most effective treatment for spermatorrhea. At this time, it is only reliable to take "Himitotsu Spermostatic Tablets", because this agent can consolidate the sperm gate and calm the nerves after taking it, and spermatorrhea can be cured. If the above symptoms have been caused by spermatorrhea, you must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Shengzhisu" to cultivate the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you continue to take it, the above symptoms can also be cured early. If patients can come to this clinic in person and use various scientific therapies such as electrotherapy, injection, and surgery, they can be guaranteed to be cured.</p>

<h3 id="e71">Breasts are an Important Weapon in Winning the Love Arena <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>The spring breeze blows the ridges. Butterflies fly in pairs. Today, when the weather is gradually warming up, who wants to put on the bulky and hateful cotton clothes again, so everyone - especially young girls in their prime, in thin, light shirts and soft wind, show their vitality and health more and more. Indeed, a woman with a graceful appearance, full of blood, with a pair of agile peaks erected in front of her chest, standing side by side, with a peach blossom-like smile on her face, a slender body, curvy, and graceful, is not this comparable to the beautiful spring scenery, graceful and moving? Because the breasts of this kind of woman are well developed, the ovarian function must be healthy, and there are no hidden diseases. Not only in the social arena, she is loved by her lover as a fairy, but also after marriage, she is regarded as a treasure by her husband, and love is more profound. She organizes a happy family and gives birth to clever children. This is so happy and gratifying!</p>
<p>But I have to say, if a woman's ovarian function is destroyed due to early chest binding, self-gratification, leucorrhea, anemia, irregular menstruation, and severe diseases, which affects the metabolism, resulting in breast atrophy and loss of beauty, then even in this bright weather, under the thin shirt, the ugliness of 'the dagger is revealed' is even more obvious. As a result, she suffers the pain of unrequited love in the love arena, and after marriage, she is often regarded as a useless thing by her husband, and there is no happiness at all! The only remedy: According to world-renowned gynecologists and my experience, only taking the ovarian preparation for women "Shengzhisu" is the most effective and effective treatment. Because this agent is made from the essence of the ovaries of young and strong animals, it can cultivate the ovarian function, promote metabolism, adjust menstruation, warm the uterus, and stop the discharge one day and night after taking it. If you continue to take it, it is guaranteed to make the breasts towering, the cheeks ruddy, and improve health and beauty in a short period of time.</p>

<p>Acute leucorrhea is unbearable for patients because of the pain, and it is the first time they have encountered it, and they do not know what to do. In fact, this kind of acute gonorrhea is not as dangerous as the patient feels when in pain. Not only is it not a dangerous symptom, but it is also an easily treated symptom. Patients should remain calm and quickly ask a doctor who is experienced, fully equipped, and willing to be responsible for treatment, so that they can be completely cured within seven or eight days. The biggest difficulty of acute leucorrhea is whether the doctor can be responsible for thoroughly treating the patient, and whether the patient can take care of themselves and discard bad drugs. If you are careful in choosing a doctor and taking care of yourself, it is the easiest way for patients to get rid of the pain of gonorrhea. Patients must pay attention! .</p>
<p>Patients develop symptoms on the third or fourth day after unclean sexual intercourse. Body temperature rises to 37-38 degrees, the glans penis is swollen, the foreskin is everted, and there is a mixture of pus and blood, and urination is unusually difficult. For the treatment of acute leucorrhea, I first use a special vaccine and the most advanced chemotherapy. At the same time, I also use the German "Filtrin" laminar electrotherapy and cooling methods, etc., to create an antitoxic effect in the body, quickly destroy the raging gonorrhea, and stop the inflammation from being fierce. Therefore, it can stop the pain on the same day, clear turbidity and reduce inflammation in three days, and be completely cured in a week. It has been tried and tested, and experts in European and Western countries have recently become very interested in this kind of therapy, and more and more people are using it. All famous venereal disease hospitals use it. The reason is that its performance is excellent, and the cure rate of acute gonorrhea accounts for more than 90%.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Repeated Obstruction of Foreign Ships: Japan's Attempt to Monopolize Shipping; British Merchants Unyielding, Fully Maintaining Services: Japanese Ships Already Took the Top Spot This Year <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Since Japanese warships blockaded our coastal areas, they have obstructed the passage of foreign ships from various countries, arbitrarily inspected them, and illegally detained them, attempting to monopolize coastal shipping. Although negotiations by consuls of the countries concerned have been ineffective, they are now using the pretext of military operations to prevent foreign ships from sailing to various ports in Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong, and northern Jiangsu, where our troops are defending. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Japan's Promotion of Shipping in China</p>
<p>Japan is making every effort to expand its shipping business in China, squeeze out foreign merchants, and attempt to monopolize it. In addition to the Shanghai-Qingdao, Shanghai-Dalian, and Shanghai-Tianjin routes, Japanese companies have opened new Shanghai-Xiamen routes and expanded inland routes, such as the Xiao Hai-Chongming line, the Shanghai-Tiansheng Port line, and the Shanghai-Xin Port line. The Dalian Steamship Company of Japan specializes in routes such as Shanghai-Qingdao-Dalian-Tianjin. The Osaka Merchant Shipping Co., Ltd. of Japan specializes in routes such as Shanghai-Xiamen-Keelung. The Nippon Yusen Kaisha specializes in routes such as Nagasaki-Kobe and various parts of Europe. In addition, the so-called Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company specializes in inland river routes in the occupied areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces.</p>
<p>Inspection and Detention of Foreign Merchant Ships</p>
<p>There are countless instances of ships of foreign merchants sailing to various ports in China being unreasonably inspected by the Japanese side. As for those detained until released on the pretext of unclear nationality: (1) Portuguese merchant ships such as Tang Bei, Tang Qiao, Tang Lu, Mei Da, Hai Long, Li Bin, Da De, Lu De, Bin De, Fu Lu, Kang Bo, Tian Ma, Ma Li, etc.; (2) Greek merchant ships Ya Sheng, Li Wu Duo, Si Ba Du; (3) Hungarian merchant ship Ai Da; (4) Panamanian merchant ship Chi Kan; (5) Norwegian merchant ships Gong Gong, Sai Wei Ke. The total number of merchant ships detained has reached more than twenty. Some are currently berthed in Shanghai or Taiwan, all under the surveillance of Japanese troops, and all ships have lost their freedom.</p>
<p>Using Military Pretexts to Obstruct Navigation</p>
<p>The coastal ports where Chinese troops are stationed include Ningbo, Haimen, and Wenzhou in Zhejiang; Fuzhou, Xinghua, and Quanzhou in Fujian; Shantou in Guangdong; Funing in northern Jiangsu; and areas controlled by guerrillas, such as the ports of Qidong and Haimen. Today, Japanese warships are arbitrarily inspecting foreign ships entering and leaving the waters off these ports, and using the pretext of military operations to prevent foreign ships from sailing to the above ports. For example, the Binli ship of the Italian Yihua Foreign Firm was blocked outside Wenzhou; the Deyao ships on the Beisha line have temporarily suspended sailing to Qidong and Haimen; and the Yongzhen and other ships were forced to suspend sailing on the Funing route in northern Jiangsu. The Nantong-Tiansheng Port line is exclusively navigated by Japanese merchants.</p>
<p>British Merchants Maintain Routes in China</p>
<p>The ships of the British Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies have always focused on sailing the north and south ocean lines and the Yangtze River routes along the Chinese coast. Now, due to Japanese obstruction, the shipping industry has been greatly affected. However, in order to maintain the original routes in China, it has been decided to spare no sacrifice. All lines will continue to send ships to sail. For example, although Jardine Matheson's Yihe ship received a notice from a Japanese warship not to sail to Beisha, the ship still sailed and decided to request protection from British warships if necessary. In addition, routes such as Shanghai-Tianjin, Shanghai-Zhejiang, Shanghai-Fujian, and Shanghai-Shantou are still sending ships on schedule. Currently, navigation has been suspended due to a sharp decline in passengers and cargo, and Japanese obstruction.</p>
<p>Extreme Decline of Shipping in Various Countries</p>
<p>The shipping industry in China of various countries has been extremely weakened by Japanese exclusion. Governments of various countries attach great importance to this. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from customs officials yesterday that comparing the number of ships entering and leaving various customs ports from January to last month, Japan has jumped to the first place, with 981 ships, 1,592,038 tons. The United Kingdom has fallen to second place, with 563 ships, 1,553,710 tons. Norwegian ships are in third place, with 151 ships, 310,738 tons. German ships are in fourth place, with 54 ships, 268,433 tons. Dutch ships are in fifth place, with 42 ships, 185,336 tons. American ships are in sixth place, with 20 ships, 116,841 tons.</p>
<h3 id="e74">The Situation in Eastern Zhejiang Remains Tense; Resumption of Navigation Unlikely in the Short Term; Japanese Warships and Aircraft Continue to Harass; Hana Requests Resumption of Shanghai-Dinghai Route <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Since the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Command ordered the prohibition of navigation in the Oujiang estuary of Wenzhou on the 23rd, the foreign ships originally sailing on that line are now temporarily berthed in Shanghai and have telegraphed Wenzhou to inquire about the situation. However, the situation in eastern Zhejiang is still extremely tense, and there is no hope of resuming navigation on the Oujiang River for the time being. The Ende ship, which was staying in Ningbo, was inspected by a Japanese warship en route to Ningbo. The ship has been changed to sail to Shanghai today. The situation in Ningbo is still peaceful. Details of various situations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Various Ships Suspend Sailing and Telegraph to Inquire About the Truth</p>
<p>Since Japanese warships and aircraft carried out wanton harassment in the Oujiang River in Wenzhou on the 22nd, the situation in eastern Zhejiang has suddenly become tense. In order to strengthen defense, the Chinese military authorities ordered the prohibition of navigation in and out of the Oujiang River by the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Command on the 23rd, and announced the blockade of traffic. The British ships Haiyang and Yingzhou, and the German ship Moufu, which were staying in Wenzhou, have all left the Oujiang River and sailed to Hong Kong and Shanghai. The German ship Deping, the German ship Haifu, Hana, and other ships sailing to Wenzhou have also turned back one after another. The Italian ship Baoli, which was blocked in the Wuli waters, also arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. All ships are now berthed at the Roosevelt Wharf at the 16th Pier. The goods loaded on board are temporarily not unloaded, so that the ships can still sail to Wenzhou when the situation eases slightly. Yesterday, the Sino-Italian Shipping Company also telegraphed Wenzhou to inquire about the truth, but no reply has been received by late evening, so all ships have temporarily suspended sailing and do not intend to change to other lines before receiving definite news.</p>
<p>Tense Situation Makes Resumption Difficult</p>
<p>A reporter from the Modern News Agency learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the Haifu ship office of the German Lihe Foreign Firm in Shanghai received a telegram from Wenzhou yesterday, stating that the Japanese warship had bombarded the Huanghuaguan Fortress again the day before yesterday (the 24th), and the garrison immediately returned fire. At the same time, Japanese aircraft flew over the urban area and dropped incendiary bombs. The detailed situation was only briefly mentioned in the telegram and was not described in detail. It also stated that the situation in eastern Zhejiang is still extremely tense, and the blockade of the Oujiang River has not been blocked, but it is feared that there is no hope of resuming navigation for the time being. It was also learned that General Commander Huang of the 10th Army Corps and Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province have ordered the garrison troops to be on strict alert. If the Japanese invade, they will resolutely strike head-on.</p>
<p>Hana Requests Resumption of Shanghai-Dinghai Route</p>
<p>Since the ports of Dinghai, Jiaojiang, Yongjiang, and Oujiang, which are open to traffic in eastern Zhejiang, have been blockaded one after another, traffic between Shanghai and Zhejiang has been completely cut off. People from Dinghai, fearing that the lack of food in their hometown will endanger the people's food supply, have requested the resumption of Shanghai-Dinghai shipping in order to provide relief. At the same time, the German Far East Shipping Company has also requested the Ningbo Defense Command to allow the Hana ship to sail on the Shanghai-Dinghai line in order to maintain traffic. According to news from the company, the request is still awaiting approval. The rumor that the ship will sail to Dinghai tomorrow or the day after tomorrow is incorrect.</p>
<p>Ende Telegrams to Sail to Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The Ende ship of the Sino-Italian Shipping Company, after loading wheat and sailing to Ningbo, was originally scheduled to return to Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday. The company received a telegram from the ship yesterday, stating that the situation in Ningbo is peaceful. Ende has changed to leave at 4:00 p.m. on the 26th due to insufficient loading, and will return directly to Shanghai, arriving in port tomorrow morning. It was also learned that the ship was prevented from sailing by a Japanese warship on the way from Shanghai to Ningbo, in the waters off the Longshan County under the jurisdiction of Zhenhai. A Japanese officer and a Taiwanese interpreter boarded the ship to inspect it, and pointed out that the ship belonged to Chinese merchants and intended to detain it. The Italian mate Bianco received the officer and explained that the ship had been transferred to Italian merchants and held an Italian certificate. The Japanese soldiers had no choice but to entangle for two hours before retreating. The ship then sailed into the Yongjiang River.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Zhejiang Postal Remittances</p>
<p>Received and Sent as Usual</p>
<p>According to another report from the Modern News Agency to the Postal Administration, since the Oujiang River was blockaded a few days ago, regarding postal remittances between Shanghai and Zhejiang, in addition to large packages and printed matter, etc., heavy mail that is inconvenient to transport, the rest, such as ordinary letters, express letters, registered letters, remittances, etc., are still being maintained and delivered as usual by the post office in order to facilitate the public. However, due to the blockage of shipping in eastern Zhejiang, the postal route will be temporarily changed to Fuzhou for transfer. Although the time will be slightly delayed, it will never be interrupted.</p>

<p>The case of the French Concession interfering with the county flag was settled, and the taken national flags were returned by the French Concession police yesterday morning after two negotiations by Qu Zhenhua, the representative of the Chinese Taxpayers Association of the French Concession. The association and Du Yuesheng's mansion both received notices from the French Consulate the night before last, stating that the taken national flags would be returned the next morning. Taxpayer Zeng then sent Secretary Guo Shuliang to various police stations such as Lujiawan yesterday morning to retrieve the national flags. A total of 226 flags were retrieved: 70 from the Lujiawan police station, 102 from the Xiafei Road police station, and 54 from the Gongguan Road police station. When Secretary Guo retrieved the flags from various police stations yesterday morning, the police chiefs of each police station solemnly returned them and asked Secretary Guo to count them one by one, which was quite solemn. According to news from the Taxpayers Association, the various merchants or citizens whose national flags were taken are requested to report to the association in writing within three days, and then the association will send personnel to return them. It is rumored that when Qu visited the French Consul General yesterday, he also mentioned the matter of not interfering with the county flag in the future, but there were no specific results. The Chinese Taxpayers Association believes that since the case has been formally negotiated with the French Ambassador by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it should wait for the overall solution.</p>

<p>Modern News Agency reports: Since traitor Wang Jingwei colluded with a certain party, made a secret agreement, and advocated the fallacy of seeking peace without authorization, not hesitating to destroy the war of resistance and sell out the nation, the whole country has been unanimously indignant. The central government, with magnanimity, considered his past history and only expelled him from the party in the hope of prompting him to reflect. But the traitor's ambitions are not yet extinguished, and he does not know how to repent. He has recently secretly sent his cronies to Shanghai to engage in activities. In addition to preparing to organize propaganda agencies such as the "Far East Daily" and the "Republic News Agency," attempting to spread rumors and numb the people, he also plans to organize a so-called "Peace National Army." It is rumored that he has set up a secret liaison agency in a certain hotel on Jing'an Temple Road, with expenses provided by a certain party. He has been sending his henchmen everywhere to win over and attempt to induce guerrilla forces in various places to defect and participate in the reorganization, hoping that his military talisman will be fulfilled. It is rumored that the leaders of guerrilla forces in various places are all filled with righteousness and deeply hate Jiang traitor's absurd behavior, so they are not used for peace. Wang traitor's progress is now deeply troubled, and it is expected that this conspiracy will be completely crushed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Grain Evaluation Committee conducted its fourth survey of grain reserves, totaling 652,456 bags, a decrease of 1,631 bags compared to the third survey. The China Bank warehouse is still in first place, with 123,613 bags. The East and West warehouses of Zhejiang Industrial Bank are in second place, with 104,312 bags. The China Industrial Bank warehouse is in third place, with 51,832 bags. The results have been reported to the Seven Rice Industry Groups and the authorities of the two concessions for their reference. The fifth survey has already begun and is expected to be completed in early next week. In addition, the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, in view of the fact that the market bushels used by the industry have not been calibrated for a long time, which may lead to some discrepancies, has decided to calibrate the market bushels for the sake of unification. It is scheduled to be held at the Miscellaneous Grain Exchange at 9:00 a.m. on the 30th.</p>

<p>According to sources in the transportation industry, since last week, the Chinese troops on the Nanjing-Shanghai line have responded to the counter-offensive and taken advantage of the Japanese army's deployment along the line to carry out major activities. Their area has advanced to the countryside five or six miles away from the transportation arteries, posing a threat to the Japanese army at any time. On the 24th of this month, about 20 meters of railway tracks near Wangting Station in Wuxi were destroyed, causing the Nanjing-Shanghai train to be delayed for an hour.</p>
<p>Kunshan</p>
<p>In the early morning of the 25th, a small steel bridge about three miles away from Kunshan Station was also blown up. After the Japanese army discovered it, they ordered road workers to repair it before traffic could be restored. Therefore, the Japanese army along the line has been running around in recent days, and their situation is very difficult. The Japanese police guard team at Fanhwangdu Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway line was suddenly attacked by guerrillas last night (the 24th). The confrontation lasted for three hours. More than 30 Japanese soldiers survived, and only a few survived. The rest were killed by the guerrillas. Two Japanese soldiers were captured alive, sent to the team for interrogation, and a Japanese army truck was destroyed. After achieving their goal, the guerrillas calmly retreated.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reports: At the beginning of the war, the Chinese army placed a water fence across the Huangpu River between the Bund in Nanshi and Pudong. The Japanese side is scheduled to start bombing at 6:20 a.m. today (the 25th).</p>
<p>Start Bombing</p>
<p>The work will be divided into three periods, from 6:20 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., from 1:50 p.m. to 3:30 p.m., and from 5:40 p.m. to sunset. During this period, the water fence will be closed and navigation will not be allowed. The Japanese say they will try to remove several old ships and more than ten sailing boats that sank to the bottom of the river. Tomorrow (the 26th), bombing will continue from 6:40 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. and from 2:20 p.m. to sunset. It is expected that the bombing of the water fence</p>
<p>Will take several days of work, but it depends on the condition of the water fence and the weather conditions. If the weather is clear, it may take less than the expected six days. In early March last year, Japanese salvage experts came to Shanghai. At that time, a part of the water fence was opened, and it was discovered that the Japanese ships sunk to build the water fence were sunk on sailing boats loaded with Sambo soil. The current work is to remove the ships in the lower layer. This water fence</p>
<p>Although a part of it has been destroyed by bombing, ships such as Dalae Company and other ships are still unable to sail downstream for commercial shipping. Smaller ships can already pass. The Hongmen (translated meaning) ship, which has been blocked downstream of the water fence for more than a year, has been granted permission to sail downstream of the Huangpu River. The Japanese warships that were destroyed by artillery fire in the Yangtze River area a few months ago either sailed on their own or were towed by other ships to the Jiangnan Shipyard for repair.</p>

<p>It is heard that He Dafu, the Western Police Chief of the Customs Water Police, is now actively seeking to restore the inherent powers before the war. In addition to the police power in the Yangshupu-Hongkou area and the patrol power in the Suzhou River, which have been restored successively, he recently submitted a request to the Customs authorities to negotiate with the Japanese side to restore the police power in Punan, which has been obtained. Therefore, the patrol boats and patrol boats of the police station have begun to carry armed Chinese and Western police officers, and one Japanese officer participates, sailing to the Zhangjiagang area south of Nanhuangpu Xinlonghua, patrolling back and forth. For all police cases, they can exercise the power of arrest on the Punan section without any hindrance.</p>
<h3 id="e81">Public Buses and Trams Increase Fare Per Mile; Public Utilities Committee Advocates; Company Expresses Agreement <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>The Public Utilities Committee and the Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau recently considered whether the mileage fees paid by the Chinese Public Bus Company and the Tram Company are appropriate. Because the purchase price of road construction materials has more than doubled, and the weight and volume of public buses have increased, considering these facts, the previously set mileage fee schedule is obviously inappropriate. The amounts opened in the schedule are as follows:</p>
<p>Previously Agreed Fee Amount: 1.5 cents of silver per English mile for those equipped with pneumatic tires, equivalent to 2.09 cents in national currency; 2 cents in national currency per English mile for trackless trams with hard wheels; 1.7 cents in national currency per English mile for trackless trams with pneumatic tires. In addition, the tram company should take 1.25% of the total income of trackless trams and pay it to the Public Works Bureau as a business permit fee.</p>
<p>Current Weight: The current public buses in general use, including those that have been customized, have increased in weight by 22% compared to the original standard public buses if each bus has half the passengers. The body weight of the commonly used trackless tram is lighter than the original standard public bus. As for the average number of passengers on public buses, it has increased from 30 to 58.</p>
<p>Methods of Increasing Fees: The Public Utilities Committee of the Public Works Bureau believes that based on the above facts, the mileage fees for public buses and trackless trams should be increased by 10% each, which is equal to the percentage of the additional vehicle license fee levied last year. As for public buses, due to the increase in weight and volume, the mileage fee should be increased by another 10%, totaling 20%, to be fair.</p>
<p>Company Agrees: The above methods of increasing mileage fees have been agreed to by the Tram Company and the Public Bus Company, and will be implemented from May 1. However, the Tram Company proposed one additional condition, that is, when the exchange rate of foreign currencies returns to the standard level, this issue should be reconsidered. The public buses of the French Tram Company, which operate in the north of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, will also pay the same increase in mileage fees. The company has expressed its agreement.</p>

<p>The North China Daily News reports: A spokesman for the Japanese Navy claimed yesterday (the 24th) when entertaining reporters that, starting tomorrow, anyone entering Yangshupu, Hongkou, and other Japanese-occupied areas must have a certificate of inoculation against epidemics.

<h3 id="e83">Zhenhai County Party Headquarters Petitions for Confiscation of Chuan Xiaochen's Property; Only Under Investigation and Not Confiscated; Still Not Enough to Appease Public Outrage <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Since Chuan Xiao'an took the false position of "Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality," his residence and ancestral hall in his native Zhenhai were sealed up by the Zhenhai County Government on the orders of the Ningbo Defense Command in January. It is now learned that the Zhenhai Party Headquarters believes that only sealing up the property without confiscating it is not enough to appease public anger, and yesterday petitioned the Zhejiang Provincial Party Headquarters to forward it to the Military Affairs Committee, stating:</p>
<p>Punishment Should Be Severe to Extend Discipline: I think that the foundation of a country is to attach importance to discipline first. If discipline is not maintained, the country will not be a country. The five thousand years of history of our China, and the glory of our culture, rely on the extension of discipline. The arduous and great undertaking of resisting the war and building the country at present depends on the praise of the Four Cardinal Principles and Eight Virtues. Therefore, rewarding loyalty should be generous, and punishment must be severe. In this way, the hearts of the people will be united, and the foundation of the war of resistance will be solid.</p>
<p>Only Sealing Up is Regrettable: The false "Mayor of Shanghai" Chuan Zongyao, whose registered residence is in Zhenhai, served a false position in his twilight years, without integrity and shame. There is nothing more to say. We, the people of the county, regret the lack of virtuous people in our hometown and hate the harm of inferior horses. Everyone points to him and wants to eat his flesh and sleep on his skin. However, the vicious situation is spreading, and it is not easy to divide the internal gaps. Under duress, the county government has presented it to the Military Affairs Committee to seal up and confiscate his residence and family property in Zhenhai. This kind of slightly relieving the people's anger and seeking the next best thing cannot stop our people's hope. Who knows that after more than three months, only sealing up has been added, and the order to confiscate has not yet been issued. The elimination of evil is not complete, and the enforcement of the law is not strict, which has caused deep regret in the opinion.</p>
<p>All Residences and Ancestral Temples Should Be Confiscated: During this period of national spiritual mobilization, the people's emotions in resisting and building the country are unusually surging. There should be no leniency in this punishment, and it should be thoroughly implemented, so as to extend the country's discipline and correct local education. We hereby present to the committee and ask to forward it to the Military Affairs Committee, to order the county government to confiscate all of Chuan Xiao's residences and ancestral temples in Zhenhai to replenish the war defense funds, so as to satisfy public sentiment and punish the traitor, which is convenient for the party.</p>

<h3 id="e84">Ministry of Finance Restricts Remittances to Occupied Areas; Four Banks Stipulate Methods for Remitting Funds from Chongqing to Shanghai; Daily Quota Set; Remittances Continue When Quota is Met <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent the escape of funds, the Ministry of Finance has to strictly restrict the purchase of foreign exchange and arbitrarily carrying legal tender to occupied areas, and restrict remittances to occupied areas. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that Chongqing's remittance exchange, where the National Government is located, is centered on Shanghai. The rise and fall of remittances are usually based on the ratio of trade and the flow of silver. However, in the past, there were often speculators</p>
<p>Manipulating to profit from it, so the rise and fall of remittances were extremely large. In recent years, due to the unification of the currency system, the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China, have also established branches in Chongqing one after another to regulate finance, so the exchange rate has gradually stabilized. However, since the beginning of the war of resistance two years ago, due to domestic traffic obstructions and the expansion of occupied areas, the remittance situation has changed slightly. Since October last year, the four banks, Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Agricultural Bank of China, stipulated that for funds remitted to Shanghai and delivered in Shanghai, a handling fee of 10 cents per hundred yuan is charged, and a transportation fee of 90 cents. Each person should</p>
<p>Not Exceed Five Hundred Yuan. For those who deliver legal tender in Shanghai, a handling fee of 10 cents per hundred yuan and a transportation fee of 3 yuan and 90 cents are charged. Each person should not exceed one hundred yuan. A total quota is set for each day. When the quota is met, remittances must continue the next day. Even for colleagues, no excess accommodation is allowed. As a result, the state of remittance exchange from Chongqing to other provinces has reappeared. The funds remitted out must be completely offset by the amount of export trade. Since the four banks restricted remittances, merchants</p>
<p>Ordering Goods from Shanghai and Hong Kong has to increase handling fees and find ways to purchase the amount needed by themselves from various export firms. As a result, the black market for remittances gradually emerged. In October last year, the exchange rate of 10 yuan per thousand yuan for settlement funds suddenly rose to 70 or 80 yuan. In November, it rose to 110 yuan. In December, it rose to 140 yuan. In January of this year, the highest price reached 170 yuan. After that, the market price recovered slightly, but it always hovered between 140 and 150 yuan. The same phenomenon also appeared in Kunming and other places.</p>

All proceeds from the tickets will be used for medical relief. At this time when the mountains and rivers have changed color, Dr. presents the Palace Museum scenery to the public. The audience will definitely have feelings of the past and present. Following the exhibition of paintings and calligraphy of previous dynasties, there will definitely be another grand occasion.</p>

<p>Continental News reports that yesterday (the 24th), it was learned that Japanese authorities are alleging that three buses owned by Jewish refugees, operating in Hongkou, are engaged in business as a public transportation company. The relief committee is conducting an investigation. The owners and drivers of the three vehicles have all denied the accusation. Japanese military police accuse the buses of carrying Chinese passengers and collecting fares, and have detained the vehicles since last week.</p>
<p>According to Japanese newspapers, a plainclothes Japanese military police officer, accompanied by a Chinese person, boarded one of these buses and was charged a fare. Consequently, all vehicles were detained pending investigation. At a press briefing last night, a Japanese military spokesperson, when questioned about military matters, stated that he only learned from the newspapers about the vehicle owners being accused of transporting Chinese passengers, but he would continue to investigate. A reporter stated that, according to his investigation, the vehicles are not public buses at all, but light freight vehicles licensed by the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession.</p>
<p>The refugee committee has conducted a wide-ranging investigation. The nine relevant co-owners and drivers have all denied carrying anyone other than Jews. The company was formed solely to help refugees save on transportation costs to and from Shanghai, and all profits earned by the owners are reinvested in the vehicles. The spokesperson responded that if they are purely for private use, the Japanese side would not object to their operation.</p>
<p>Another reporter then asked about the status of the Japanese public buses currently operating in Hongkou. Are the Japanese authorities still insisting that these public buses are operating for military convenience, or will they now openly admit that they are public businesses run by commercial companies? The spokesperson replied that this matter is a complex issue and cannot be answered immediately. He then added that the matter is currently under discussion by "relevant parties," and therefore he could not make any further announcements.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs previously announced examination procedures for the transportation of prohibited goods to Shanghai, stipulating that all 54 types of goods would be examined by four agencies: the Trade Commission, the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Commission, the Resources Commission, and the Agricultural and Rural Bureau. Subsequently, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, citing the different examination agencies, noted the difficulty merchants faced when seeking approval. After requesting instructions from the Ministry, a detailed list was provided, specifying which agency should approve certain goods to avoid incorrect submissions. It is now reported that the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to facilitate merchants and the public, has amended Article 5 of the examination procedures, assigning responsibility for approval to the county and city governments at the point of origin, thereby streamlining the process. The amended procedures were announced on April 8th.</p>

<p>Continental News reports that yesterday (the 24th), it was learned that several foreigners' goods stored in the warehouse of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) in Hongkou were destroyed in a recent fire. Claims for compensation have been filed with a Japanese insurance company, but without satisfactory results. The insurance company's only response to the claims is that the matter has been handed over to the "Foreign Affairs Department" for review. Meanwhile, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated at a press briefing last night that the cause of the fire is still under investigation. A suspicious device was found in the fire, but due to the intense heat, the suspicion could not be confirmed. An investigation is expected to proceed once a large quantity of cotton has been removed. The spokesperson further stated that there have been ten fires in Japanese warehouses recently, two of which were confirmed as arson. Arson is suspected as the cause of six out of ten fires at the NYK warehouse. Furthermore, on several occasions recently, Japanese ships setting sail from Shanghai have been found to have cargo loaded in Shanghai on fire.</p>

<p>Zhang Pinquan, the head of the puppet "Government Affairs Office" in Zhabei, has been arrogant and domineering since taking office. The day before yesterday (the 23rd), Zhang went from the puppet office to the "puppet municipal government" in the city center to attend a meeting, but has not returned since and is suddenly missing. His family is quite surprised and sent someone to the "puppet municipal government" to inquire, but were told that he had not attended the meeting at the "government" and had not returned to the puppet "office." It is suspected that Zhang's whereabouts were discovered by Chinese plainclothes teams and he was intercepted on the way. Zhang's family is now requesting the Japanese authorities to investigate his whereabouts.</p>

<p>Chen Bo'an, a wealthy gentleman from Fengxian, brought his concubine, Ms. Li, and his two sons from the concubine, Junfu and Juntan, to Shanghai to seek refuge after the August 13th Incident. He subsequently fell ill and passed away in the inn. Afterwards, his wife, Ma Wenyun, and her sons, Junhai, Junhui, Junyan, Jun'e, and Junqu, arrived and completed the funeral arrangements. Upon inspecting the property deeds and documents stored in the chests, they discovered that they had all been embezzled by Ms. Li and her sons. As a result, his wife, concubine, brothers, and sons filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court of the French Concession, where they resided. After the initial trial, the losing party is currently appealing to the Third Branch Court of the Higher Court. Recently, Chen Ma's family discovered that Ms. Li and her sons, along with their relatives Yang Jinglu and Yang Yaozhang (also known as Yang Shuzhen), had embezzled estate property in the International Settlement. Therefore, they filed a private criminal suit against Chen Li's family in the First Special District Court, accusing them of embezzlement. A hearing was held once, but it was postponed until yesterday morning due to incomplete witness testimony. Judge Zhong Qing presided over the hearing. Only Chen Junfu appeared as a defendant. The others claimed illness or had left Shanghai and did not attend. The case file requested from the French Concession court could not be transferred because the appeal was still in progress. Judge Zhong, after considering the case, advised both parties to first request the civil court to resolve the disputed points. He then ruled in court to suspend the trial of this case.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Foreign Exchange Control Effective - Reduction in Foreign Goods Imported to Shanghai - Gradual Recovery of Various Industries, Increased Financial Stability - Japanese Puppet Regime's Attempts to Plunder Capital Fail <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Since the central government implemented wartime financial controls and restricted foreign exchange applications, imports of various non-essential commodities have decreased, and national funds have become more abundant. The Shanghai market's industry and commerce, with the vigorous assistance of the financial sector and the granting of loan facilities, have seen exceptional financial flexibility. The currency system in the war zones remains solid. The Japanese attempts to plunder civilian funds have failed. Details are provided below:</p>
<p>Monthly Decline in Foreign Goods Imported to Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance implemented foreign exchange controls and issued restrictions on applications, with the exception of essential industrial raw materials ordered from Europe and the United States, the central government has also made appropriate accommodations for essential commodities to protect industry and commerce. However, various industries in Shanghai, in order to conserve national resources for long-term resistance, have voluntarily reduced the amount of foreign exchange applied for. According to recent reports from the Central Bank of China and the customs authorities, the value of foreign goods imported to Shanghai has decreased month by month. The import of essential industrial raw materials through the southwestern customs points has significantly increased.</p>
<p>Vigorous Financial Recovery in Various Industries</p>
<p>Following the outbreak of the "August 13th" Songhu Battle, all industries were in a state of stagnation. Subsequently, factories in various industries relocated from the war zone to the concession area and resumed production, leading to improved conditions. At the same time, the financial sector provided vigorous assistance to various industries by granting loans. The banks and financial institutions themselves benefited from the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China's large-scale loans, resulting in increased capital and exceptionally stable finances. With the fourth quarter approaching, since the implementation of cash transactions among industries, the economic turnover is more active than before the war. No significant difficulties are expected during the settlement period.</p>
<p>Japanese Puppet Regime Fails to Plunder Capital</p>
<p>In the war zone along the Yangtze River, the Japanese are using their special influence to force the public to use Japanese currency and military scrip in order to plunder legal tender, in an attempt to buy foreign exchange and disrupt China's financial system. Recently, the "provisional government" of North China also transported large quantities of unprepared "Joint Notes" for mixed use in various regions. The puppet "Jiangsu Provincial Government" is also preparing to establish a "Provincial Bank" and issue banknotes. It is now learned that the people in the interior consider the Japanese puppet banknotes to have no value or credit. Even under the threat of violence, they are unwilling to use them. Since the middle of last month, transactions between Shanghai and the interior have been handled through alternative remittance methods. This prevents the Japanese puppet regime from absorbing funds and avoids accidental risks. Therefore, the Japanese plot is ultimately difficult to achieve.</p>

<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing</p>
<p>— Zhou</p>
<p>The Spirit of Serving Society - Lifetime Devotion to Loyalty, Trustworthiness, Diligence, and Frugality - Decades of Struggle, Admired by Chinese and Foreigners - New Compilation of Old News - Shanghai's Anecdotes</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing, at the advanced age of 73, continues to serve society with unwavering dedication. His achievements and virtues have long been admired by Chinese and foreigners alike. Yesterday, the reporter visited him and engaged in a lengthy conversation with Mr. Yu in his simply furnished reception room. He was enthusiastic, tireless, and his sincere attitude was truly admirable.</p>
<p>From the conversation, it was learned that Mr. Yu has voluntarily resigned from many public positions in recent years and now only serves as a Chinese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, chairman of the Refugee Relief Association, and chairman of the Ningbo Fellow Association. Mr. Yu has been re-elected to the position of Chinese director of the Shanghai Municipal Council in successive elections, without any changes. This is not only due to his long-standing historical connections and his being respected by Chinese and foreign circles, but also because Mr. Yu himself feels that his aspirations for the municipal administration of the concession have not yet been fully realized, and he continues to serve. Mr. Yu has always prioritized responsibility in any public or private position. Regardless of the weather, he goes to his office every day. He personally participates in banquets and condolences. He is still in his office at around 7:00 or 8:00 PM every evening. He personally reviews all public and private letters and telegrams, even on holidays. His spirit of service is truly worthy of emulation by future generations. His personal life is extremely frugal. His long gowns and black jackets are all domestically produced. He has no special hobbies and is very much suited to the common people. He pays close attention to the content of various newspapers and expressed his deep admiration for this newspaper, praising it as a good read for the industrial and commercial community.</p>
<p>After meeting Mr. Yu, the reporter first asked him to share his opinions on the Qingnian service industry and commerce, based on his personal experience of serving society. Mr. Yu said that, in terms of his personal experience of dealing with the world, he adheres to the four principles of loyalty, trustworthiness, diligence, and frugality as the main purpose. Loyalty and trustworthiness are used to deal with the world, while diligence and frugality are used to cultivate oneself. Looking around the world, all those who have achieved great success have followed this path. Even in his own case, his early circumstances were extremely difficult. Now, he humbly accepts the appreciation of society and has always adhered to these four principles. In recent times, the world is becoming increasingly decadent, with a growing preference for novelty. The environment in Shanghai is complex, and young people can easily go astray if they are not careful, eventually leading to personal ruin and a damaged reputation. Mr. Yu also said that he had long wanted to share this point with the industrial and commercial community in Shanghai. Having been asked, he only offers a humble opinion and hopes that young people can practice it diligently.</p>
<p>The reporter then asked about the current state of relief work. Mr. Yu said that he has always been enthusiastic about relief work in the city. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, war refugees have flocked to the city, numbering as many as one million. Fortunately, Chinese and foreign relief organizations have worked tirelessly and wholeheartedly to implement relief efforts, benefiting the refugees greatly. After more than a year of operation, the dedication and perseverance of Chinese and foreign people are truly admirable. In accordance with the principles of human mutual assistance, all residents of Shanghai have an unshirkable duty. After consultation between Chinese and foreign parties, the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association was established in November of last year, and he was elected as the chairman. At that time, there were still more than 100,000 refugees, all of whom were poor and had nowhere to go. In order to harness the power of the people, reduce the worries of the Relief Committee about Shanghai refugees, and save relief funds for refugees in the interior, the establishment of the Association was urgent. Prior to this, he consulted with foreign business leaders, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Financial Industry Association, local associations, and charitable organizations with whom he had friendly relations. They all expressed their enthusiastic support for refugee relief, and the Association was established and began to implement relief work. So far, it has established two shelters in Yanping Road and Dunxin Road, merging some shelters in the central area of the two concessions, which has greatly facilitated management. In addition, city housing is allowed to be borrowed for a long time. However, refugee relief should focus on both education and care, in order to turn them into self-sufficient producers in the future. Therefore, an education committee and an education department were added to the Association, and famous figures from the academic community were invited to plan and implement the work together. According to his age, he should have retired, but for the sake of refugee relief, he cannot shirk his responsibility and has to work hard to shoulder the burden, in order to express his sincere intention to contribute.</p>
<p>The reporter continued to inquire about the situation in Shanghai. Mr. Yu was enthusiastic and inspiring. The reporter then asked about his early years of service to society. The reporter said that he would use Mr. Yu's virtue to encourage future generations. Mr. Yu smiled and said that it would be acceptable to talk about his experience as a minor anecdote in Shanghai, just like the new "New Compilation of Old News" section of your newspaper. Mr. Yu said that he came to Shanghai in the eighth year of the reign of Emperor Guangxu of the Qing Dynasty (i.e., 1881 AD) and has been here for 58 years. In these 58 years, what he has seen and experienced is vast and complex. Here are some of the more prominent things he remembers: (1)</p>

<h3 id="e95">Previous Night's Tragic Car Accident in Hongkou: Police Department Investigates the Case – Sentry's Harsh Order to Stop Led to a Major Calamity – Japanese Soldiers Patrol Hospital and Assault Chief Inspector – Bureau Awaits Report Before Lodging Protest – Dr. Li Li Devoted His Life to Education, Sudden Passing Mourned by Chinese and Foreigners <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>*The Continental Daily* reports that Dr. Li Li, principal of the Lester School of Industry, was driving his car in Hongkou just after 9:00 PM last night (the 24th). Mrs. Li Li and Western Inspector Wimsett of the Public Concession Police were also in the car. They encountered a Japanese sentry who ordered them to stop. Li Li stopped too quickly, and because the road was slippery, he crashed into a Japanese public bus, resulting in his death. This was only six hours after Li Li's return to Shanghai from England (Editor's note: This matter was briefly mentioned in the last news item in yesterday's newspaper in the Local News and Telegraph section). Mrs. Li Li and the Western inspector were also seriously injured. The former had lacerations on her face and forehead, while the latter, Mr. Wimsett, suffered a fractured left leg and ribs. While the details of this tragedy were not fully known last night,</p>
<p>Sentry's Order to Stop Causes Accident</p>
<p>It is known that the collision occurred around 9:05 PM. Dr. Li Li and the other two were returning after inspecting the buildings of the Lester School, heading along Minhang Road. It is reported that as the car was about to turn onto Broadway Road to cross the Garden Bridge, they encountered a Japanese sentry who ordered them to stop. When the car did not stop immediately, the sentry jumped onto the running board and loudly ordered Li Li to stop. Li Li immediately slammed on the brakes, but because it had rained in the evening and the road surface was slippery, Li Li's car skidded violently across the corner of Minhang Road and Broadway Road, colliding with a Japanese public bus traveling north from the Garden Bridge. The impact was so severe that the car was completely destroyed, and the front of the public bus was also heavily damaged. A call was immediately made to the Fire Department, and an ambulance was summoned. However, by the time the ambulance arrived, Li Li had already died. His body, along with Mrs. Li Li and Western Inspector Wimsett, were taken to the Country Hospital.</p>
<p>A Team of Japanese Soldiers Suddenly Arrives at the Hospital</p>
<p>They remained in the hospital last night. The injured Western inspector's condition is quite serious. As for the sentry who attempted to stop the car, he was thrown from the running board during the collision and was taken away by the Japanese Naval authorities. No news of his injuries has been received, but it is said his condition is also serious. The Japanese driver of the public bus also sustained minor injuries. A Chinese female ticket seller in the bus had a cut above her right eye and suffered a concussion. Last night, responsible parties claimed that shortly after the incident, a team of Japanese Marines arrived at the Country Hospital, requesting to see the injured. Hospital authorities initially refused them access to Mrs. Li Li and Western Inspector Wimsett but eventually allowed them to view Li Li's body. It is reported that the Marines then used force and intimidation, insisting on seeing Mrs. Li Li's face. At that time, a Japanese officer arrived on the scene and ordered the soldiers to return, while he was granted permission to see Mrs. Li Li.</p>
<p>Founder of Lester School Recently Returned to Shanghai</p>
<p>Dr. Li Li was born in 1901 in Durham, England, and studied at Sunderland Technical College. He came to Shanghai in 1933 and established the Lester School of Industry at 505 East Seward Road. He returned to his home country for official business ten weeks ago, and only yesterday afternoon did he return to Shanghai aboard the German ship *Gneisenau*. Western Inspector Wimsett is also British, and his wife and children are in Shanghai. He was scheduled to leave Shanghai next month for his first long-term vacation. Why he was also riding in Li Li's car was not confirmed last night. It is speculated that he was returning to the Public Concession south of the Suzhou Creek and therefore asked to ride with Li Li. According to the Domei News Agency, Dr. Li Li "failed to avoid" the sentry, leading to the collision. The injured sentry was a first-class seaman, and the driver of the Japanese public bus was Chinese, not Japanese. It is also said that Li Li's car sped past the Japanese naval sentry post on the Garden Bridge, and the Japanese naval authorities immediately began an investigation but refused to issue a formal statement last night.</p>
<p>Car Smashed in Unprecedented Tragedy</p>
<p>After the incident, traffic on Broadway Road was blocked for some time. Trams entering the factory at night could not cross the Garden Bridge and stopped along the Bund, from the bridge to Nanjing Road. Also, *The North-China Daily News* reported that just after 9:00 PM last night, Dr. Li Li, accompanied by his wife and Western Inspector Wimsett, was in a green Ford sedan that collided violently with a Japanese public bus near Broadway Road and Pengpu Road. Li Li's car was struck in the center of the right side by the public bus. Both doors were destroyed, and the roof was torn off. There was blood in the rear compartment of the car. The severity of the collision could be seen from the state of the seats and the floor. Western Inspector Wimsett was sitting in the back seat and bled profusely before being removed from the car. Reporters arrived on the scene a few minutes later, but several Japanese sentries, with bayonets fixed on their rifles, surrounded the two cars and prevented them from approaching. The windshield of the public bus was completely destroyed, and the radiator and right fender were also heavily damaged.</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Threaten and Assault Chief Inspector</p>
<p>The reporter witnessed astonishing scenes at the Country Hospital. Several Public Concession Police officers in plainclothes and uniforms, along with a Japanese officer, believed to be an officer of the Japanese Marines, accompanied by two guards with rifles, strode into the reception room. Speaking in Japanese, they firmly demanded that others show them the injured parties' rooms and lead them to the responsible doctors. They also questioned Chief Inspector Samson of the Police, speaking in Japanese. Samson, who did not understand Japanese, could not comprehend their meaning. Unexpectedly, the Japanese officer punched Samson below his right ear and ordered him to leave. Samson maintained his composure and retreated several steps. Seeing the Japanese officer approaching him again in a threatening manner, he said that he would return with the Japanese chief inspector from the Hongkou Police Station. He then left the hospital and went to the Hongkou Police Station, but the Japanese chief inspector, despite being summoned by telephone, had not arrived by 10:15 PM.</p>
<p>Attempt to See Injured Parties Ultimately Rejected</p>
<p>The Japanese officer then, along with several others who arrived at the same time, attempted to forcibly enter the sickrooms again, but were prevented by doctors MacGollrick and Anderson, who were treating the injured. Seeing that their efforts had failed, the Japanese officer attempted to prevent anyone from leaving the hospital and tried to gather everyone in the reception room into one room for questioning. After Samson was struck, a minor incident occurred. The shoes and police cap worn by Western Inspector Wimsett were taken out by a deputy police inspector in plainclothes. Upon seeing this, the Japanese officer suddenly asked the deputy police inspector in English where he had gotten the shoes and cap and why he was taking them. The deputy police inspector replied that the doctor had given them to him. The Japanese officer then remained silent. An hour after the incident, about twenty-five Japanese officers and soldiers were on the scene measuring the width of the road and recording it. A detective from the Hongkou Police Station was also on the scene recording. A Japanese photographer was taking flash photographs.</p>
<p>Son Suffering from Cough, Mother Requested to Return Home</p>
<p>Late last night, it was reported that Mrs. Li Li was in stable condition and would be able to return to her residence on Weihaiwei Road this morning (the 25th). Although Western Inspector Wimsett had lost a lot of blood, he had to remain in the hospital, but his injuries were also satisfactory. Dr. Li Li was highly regarded in the local education and social circles, and his sudden death is mourned by all sectors. The doctor has a son who is only three years old. According to *The Shanghai Times*, Mrs. Li Li asked the doctor to send her home after undergoing surgery because her son was suffering from a cough and needed his mother's care. The doctor naturally refused.</p>
<p>Collecting Evidence in Preparation for Protest</p>
<p>According to the English *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury*, Mrs. Li Li and Western Inspector Wimsett, who were injured in the car accident in Hongkou, are still unable to speak freely, so the Municipal Council Police have not been able to obtain the details of the accident. This morning (the 25th), Mrs. Li Li's condition improved slightly, but Mr. Wimsett's condition is still quite serious. The Japanese public bus that collided with Li Li's car was operating without a Municipal Council license, infringing on the rights of the China General Omnibus Company. The bus only had a small green light on the front, making it difficult to see at night. Chief Inspector Samson was punched in the head by a Japanese officer at the Country Hospital. This morning, according to a senior official of the Municipal Council, the Japanese side has not yet apologized to the Police. It was also stated that the Police are currently busy collecting the details of the case, and because Mrs. Li Li and the Western inspector were both seriously injured, it will take some time. Once a detailed report has been prepared, it will be submitted to the Municipal Council for review.</p>
<p>Home Burglarized, Awaiting Interrogation</p>
<p>A reporter from the *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury* inquired at the office of the Secretary-General of the Municipal Council as to whether a protest had been lodged with the Japanese authorities regarding this case. The reply was that the Municipal Council was awaiting a detailed report. Dr. Li Li's residence at 401 Great Western Road was recently burglarized, with significant losses, including a radio worth 400 yuan. Mrs. Li Li was unable to determine the total value of the remaining items. The Police were waiting for Li Li's return to inquire about everything, but unfortunately, this could not be fulfilled. His residence faces the Municipal Council Road and backs onto "badlands" not managed by the Police. Li Li's body was examined at the International Funeral Parlor at 2:30 PM this afternoon by the coroner of the British Consulate General, confirming that he died from his injuries.</p>

<p>Recently, rice transported to Shanghai from the mainland has mostly been unloaded at the Tianhou Temple Changtai Transportation Dock on the Suzhou Creek, designated by the Municipal Council. Laborers have always been contracted to handle the unloading and transportation. These laborers, numbering no less than a thousand, are organized into the Shanghai Rice Cart Shoulder Transportation Industry Labor Union and have generally been peaceful. However, recently, local tyrants Zhang Liguo and Zhang Jiujin, etc., coveting profits, gathered their henchmen and, specifically at Changtai Transportation and undesignated docks, have been obstructing rice boats from proceeding to the docks designated by the Municipal Council, arbitrarily extorting money, and exploiting the livelihoods of cart laborers, causing hundreds of laborers who rely on this for a living to be unemployed. When challenged, they resort to violence. It is reported that Zhang and others dare to act so recklessly, with one Tao acting as the mastermind behind the scenes. Previously, representatives from various rice industry associations, on behalf of the laborers, petitioned the authorities to find a way to prohibit this, but no effect was seen. The laborers believe that this kind of arrogant and predatory behavior is not only related to public safety and hinders the commercial market, but is also prohibited by law. Therefore, the Labor Union has hired lawyer Zhang Enhai as its permanent legal advisor, posting public notices and filing a lawsuit with the court to investigate the matter according to law.</p>

<p>Zeng Yuren, a native of Hunan, previously served in the Songhu Garrison Command. After the war, he defected and joined the Special High Branch of the Jin-gugu Gendarmerie Command of the Japanese military, where he served as a detective. From then on, relying on his potential power, he engaged in various fraudulent activities. At 10:00 PM on the 23rd of this month, Zeng suddenly went to the Santai Hotel at 484 Jiujiang Road, accompanied by Xu Yongfa, a native of Nanjing, claiming that the hotel was selling counterfeit Japanese passes.</p>
<p>Therefore, He came to search. The hotel claimed that this was not the case, and that they had only hired a car for a guest to go to Hongkou. After searching the accounts table, no passes or other items were found. Zeng continued to make a scene, insisting that the Santai Hotel was indeed forging passes, and intended to take the staff member Wu Xinhe to the Japanese Gendarmerie Command. Xu acted as a mediator. As a result, Zeng took</p>
<p>Ten yuan in legal tender from the accounts table. Before leaving, he stated that he would have to come back tomorrow, revealing that the hotel would have to give him a considerable sum of money to settle the matter. On the 24th, Zeng and Xu indeed came again, behaving even more fiercely than the day before. At the time, he made a phone call to the Yangtze Hotel, claiming to be notifying the office of the Japanese Gendarmerie Command to</p>
<p>Send someone to Arrest the Criminal. The owner of the Santai Hotel, Ren Zixian, managed to report to the Old Zha Police Station. Chinese Detective Sun Dafa rushed to the scene and arrested Zeng and Xu. A detective certificate from the Special High Branch of the Jin-gugu Gendarmerie Command was found on Zeng. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special District. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi charged them with</p>
<p>Extortion and Fraud under Article 346 of the Criminal Law, and requested that the hearing be postponed to allow for investigation of the defendants' identities, etc. Subsequently, Ren Zixian, Wu Xinhe, and others filed petitions detailing the extortion they had suffered. After interrogating the two defendants, Judge Xiao Xiezhen ordered them to be detained and the hearing postponed.</p>

<p>Mr. Wang, a native of Pudong who is a senior staff member of a real estate department of a foreign firm, is over forty years old and resides at No. 2 Jingxing Village, Avenue Joffre, French Concession. Wang's wife, Mrs. Liu, is forty-one years old this year and has a daughter named Peizhen, who is seventeen years old this year. She has a beautiful face, has received higher primary education, and is awaiting marriage. A local man named Wang Heshang, who is twenty-nine years old this year, lives at No. 223 North Qianjiatang, East Baoshan Road. Every morning at the vegetable market near the Sacred Heart of Mary Church on Avenue du Lutet,</p>
<p>A Fresh Meat Stall Is Set Up For business and has not yet married. On the morning of the 6th of this month, Mr. Wang's daughter, Wang Peizhen, took a basket to the vegetable market on Avenue du Lutet to buy vegetables. Passing in front of Wang Heshang's meat stall, Wang suddenly saw Peizhen and was struck by her beauty. He immediately struck up a conversation with the girl, and then induced her to stay at his house. He treated her kindly with lunch and dinner. In the evening, Wang Heshang pretended to send the girl home, and brought her to the Xixing Hotel on Avenue du Lutet and booked Room No. 1. That night, he</p>
<p>Forcibly Violated the Girl. Afterwards, he still did not let her go. The two lived in the hotel for nine consecutive days. Initially, the girl's parents, due to their daughter's disappearance, sent people out to search for her without any trace. Just as they were in alarm and suspicion, they suddenly received a letter from their daughter Peizhen, summoning her mother, Mrs. Liu, to the Xixing Hotel for a talk. Mrs. Liu responded to the summons and met with her daughter. Peizhen told her mother that she had already had relations with Wang Heshang, and Wang Heshang was willing to marry her, and she was willing to marry him. The Wangs listened to their daughter's words and did not object. They told the girl to inform Wang Heshang that he must send a tea gift of 300 yuan. Unfortunately, Wang Heshang's purse was empty and he could not afford it. He asked Dai Buxiang, the owner of the Greater China Hotel at the intersection of Fuzhou Road and Yu Qiaqing Road, to mediate with the girl's parents. As of now, it has been more than half a month, and because Wang Heshang has no money, the situation cannot be resolved. The girl's parents believe that Wang Heshang intends to ruin their daughter's reputation, which is especially hateful. Therefore, the girl's mother, Mrs. Wang Liu, reported to the French Police, who dispatched detectives the other day to</p>
<p>Arrest Wang Heshang. He was sent to the Second Special Court. Yesterday, Judge Liao Yuan conducted a preliminary hearing in the First Criminal Court. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi, representing the French Concession Administration, stated the facts of the case and requested an adjournment for further investigation before filing a lawsuit. After reviewing the case in court, the judge issued an order for the defendant to be detained and a further hearing scheduled for May 3. The defendant was taken into custody. An order was also issued for the victim to undergo a medical examination at the Medical Examiner's Office pending verification.</p>

<p>Liu Zhen, a Ningbo woman, is twenty years old and resides at No. 1 Dong Zhuanbang, Yidingpan Road, West Shanghai. She once worked as a dance hostess, but is now a female worker in a factory, earning more than twenty yuan a month. She attends evening classes and is diligent in her studies. She also has three family members, including her sister-in-law. Her mother is addicted to gambling, and her brother suffers from epilepsy, confined to bed all year round, and does not work. All the household expenses rely on Liu alone. Therefore, she is often in financial straits and lacks funds. Yesterday evening around 8:30 PM, her mother again tried to force Liu to return to her old profession and become a dance hostess again to ease the household burden. The girl refused, as she was born into a prominent family and had an inheritance of over 100,000 yuan, which was all squandered by her mother on smoking and gambling, leaving the family destitute. Although she now works to make a living, she is keeping herself clean and can still find solace. She is determined not to engage in the life of hugging and embracing again. She begged her mother, but her mother's inferior nature was too deep-rooted and she became angry out of shame, beating her several times. After being comforted by those living with her, Liu had thoughts of death and secretly took raw opium to commit suicide. She was taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment. It is said that she took too much poison, and her life is in danger.</p>

<p>Lin Linlin, a prostitute from Jiangsu, age twenty-five, runs a brothel at No. *something* Qunyu Lane, Shantou Road. Xiao Xianggu, who is close friends with Lin, also plies the trade of a courtesan. Because Lin's brothel had spare rooms, Xiao Xianggu moved in after the Lunar New Year, sharing the profession and making a living. One of Lin's clients, however, often interacted with Xiao Xianggu and was seduced by her, paying attention to her day and night and effectively switching sides. Lin Linlin, upon discovering this, could not help but be consumed by jealousy, becoming heartbroken. She lamented the client's heartlessness and hated Xiao Xianggu's disloyalty, so she made sarcastic remarks and ridiculed her from time to time. However, Xiao Xianggu was not weak either and often mocked Lin. Lin Linlin, feeling angry and unjust, issued an eviction order, telling Xiao Xianggu to move out. So, at 11:30 PM last night, a major quarrel broke out over this matter. Xiao Xianggu was at a loss for words but was unwilling to submit. She summoned five thugs from outside and went to the brothel to use force, actually piercing Lin's head with a hole, causing blood to flow profusely. The furnishings in the room were also smashed to pieces. Fortunately, the room attendants mediated and pleaded for peace, which stopped the violence. Lin was sent to Baolong Hospital for treatment. Since the matter involved bloodshed, the hospital reported it to the Old Zha Police Station, which dispatched Detective No. 98 to investigate and report back to the police station. The police are now tracking down Xiao Xianggu and the thugs to bring them to justice.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Youth of Science and Wealth <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>I have previously stated that impoverished youth should strive in science and that they have the potential for invention and achievement. Now, I would like to humbly offer my opinions to the wealthy youth, as encouragement. Wealthy youth inherit the legacy of their fathers and elder brothers, their lives are free from material concerns, and they face no difficulties in studying. Impoverished individuals can dedicate themselves to scientific research and still become experts, benefiting the nation and society, and achieving immortal fame. If young people with abundant resources and convenient opportunities are willing to strive for progress, their accomplishments in science will be limitless. The Englishman Galton is an example of a wealthy young man who became a great figure in the history of science. Galton, in his youth, due to his family's wealth, did not need to rush into making a living, and he enjoyed studying science on his own. Initially, he studied geography, traveling extensively in continental Europe and South Africa. Later, he studied meteorology, biology, mathematics, and finally specialized in genetics, where he laid the foundation for eugenics (the commonly translated "優生學" - literally 'superior birth studies') and made significant contributions to anthropometry, eventually becoming as famous as Darwin, Huxley, and Spencer. In Europe and America, numerous wealthy young people have achieved great success and fame in science in a similar manner, making good use of their opportunities to benefit themselves and the world. Wealthy young people in our country should take them as role models. After the Russian Revolution, the assets of the former nobles and wealthy families were completely lost. Among them, those who were proficient in various sciences are now distributed in various countries, serving as university professors or specialized technicians, with stable lives and growing reputations. Those who were accustomed to luxury and ease, lazy and incompetent, could not even survive, wandering in foreign lands and becoming beggars. This is something our people have witnessed, and wealthy young people should take it as a warning. In the past, our country encountered unprecedented disasters. The soldiers on the front lines who resisted the enemy did not hesitate to sacrifice themselves and shed their blood for the freedom of the nation. Government leaders launched a nationwide spiritual mobilization. Many wealthy young people were enthusiastic patriots, rising up to fight together, using rare opportunities to dedicate themselves to scientific pursuits, either studying at school or learning on their own at home, using their wealth, time, and energy for scientific work, which will surely benefit the future of the nation. I hope that those with aspirations will not dismiss my words as irrelevant.</p>
<h3 id="e111">The Story of Steelmaking <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>Iron can be said to be everywhere, generally existing in the form of compounds with oxygen, that is, iron oxide. If iron oxide is heated together with carbon, iron can be obtained. What is obtained in this way is cast iron or wrought iron, with most of the impurities from the ore contained inside. After being heated and hammered, most of it can be removed. Ordinary blacksmiths do this kind of work, shaping it into various forms. However, it is too soft and not suitable for practical use, nor can it be used for cast iron (sand casting). This is because it only melts at 2700 degrees Fahrenheit, which is the melting point of pure iron. However, people are very clever and have found ways to harden it. First, the wrought iron is hammered into the desired shape, then buried in charcoal and heated, then taken out and immersed in water or oil. Skilled craftsmen can forge it as hard as modern-day blades. People at the time naturally knew how to do it, but not why. We now know that carbon slowly penetrates the iron, like gas penetrating wood. When iron contains carbon, it will harden when suddenly cooled while hot. Because the carbon is drilled in from the outside, skilled blacksmiths can forge weapons with sharp blades and tough bodies. They can indeed make good steel, but the output will not be large and the price will be high.</p>
<p>At the same time, the method of melting iron was also developed, which involves using deep charcoal furnaces with air blown in, burying the iron deep inside so that it melts. However, the result is not very much like iron because it becomes very brittle, like glass. But it can be used for sand casting. The iron used two hundred years ago was all this kind of cast iron. We know that iron made in this way contains as much as 3.5% carbon, and the melting point is reduced by 3500 degrees, but it is still higher than the melting point of brass. This method was still used to make iron in the early twentieth century. The furnaces used could only produce six tons of iron per day.</p>
<p>At that time, steel was made from wrought iron, but the output was very small. In 1856, the German Bessemer came up with the idea of forcing air into hard iron, causing it to burn spontaneously. In twenty minutes, fifteen tons of steel could be made. This turned brittle iron into flexible steel, which was also stronger than wrought iron. As a result, the price was greatly reduced, and it became possible to build railways on a large scale.</p>
<p>In addition, there is the open-hearth furnace method. This method is not as good as the Bessemer method, partly because it uses more fuel and partly because the output is not very large. However, because it can use any kind of iron as raw material, the quality of the steel produced is relatively good. Therefore, thirty years ago, the amount of steel produced using open-hearth furnaces exceeded the amount produced using the Bessemer method. Ten years ago, it exceeded it by as much as seven times.</p>
<p>Whether making steel or iron, the need for air to aid combustion is the same. In reality, it is the oxygen that is needed. But air is only 23% oxygen. Therefore, if oxygen can be used directly, the smelting method can also be improved. However, the price of oxygen is too high, which is not cost-effective. Recently, the method of manufacturing oxygen has improved, and the gradual use of oxygen has indeed achieved great results. Costs can be reduced, output can be increased, quality can be uniform, procedures can be simplified, and raw materials and fuels of inferior quality can be used. Impurities such as sulfur and phosphorus can also be reduced. Sulfur and phosphorus are harmful components in steel and iron, and are absolutely undesirable. Oxygen can be used to burn them away cleanly.</p>

<p>The latest greenhouse-style reconnaissance aircraft has been tested during US Army maneuvers, with excellent results. This reconnaissance aircraft actually resembles a flying greenhouse. Its long cockpit roof is entirely covered with transparent glass panels, providing the greatest possible field of vision. The fuselage is a mid-wing design, equipped with an 850-horsepower engine and retractable landing gear. This is the most suitable aircraft for high-altitude reconnaissance.</p>

<p>— Passerby under the Bridge</p>
<p>The ancients said that eight thousand years is a spring, and eight thousand years is an autumn. Is this really true?</p>
<p>Let's not talk about textual research for now, and just ask, what is the length of human life? As far as individuals are concerned, living to a hundred years is a long life. Everyone knows that there are indeed centenarians. However, "it is rare to live to seventy years since ancient times." Most people do not live to seventy. What exactly is human life, and what method should be used to report it? People with common sense will say that the average can be used as a report. This is correct; this report is called average lifespan. Suppose there are two people, one who dies at one year old and another who dies at fifty-nine years old. The total age of the two people is sixty, so the average age is thirty. Everyone can see clearly here that wherever infants die in greater numbers, the average lifespan of the people there will inevitably be shorter. The relationship between average lifespan and infant mortality is too deep. In other words, adults are actually implicated by young children, so it is not very appropriate to use it to report on the length of human life. Currently, the comparison of human lifespan in various countries is reported using "median lifespan." Suppose a hundred children are born in a certain place on a certain day of a certain month of a certain year. These hundred people of the same age will naturally grow up together, and some will naturally return to their hometown midway. Deaths in childhood are not counted. If the number of deaths at the age of sixty-six is the highest, then sixty-six years old is taken as the median lifespan, or the normal lifespan. The normal lifespan in advanced countries has reached over seventy years. This is a report based on the majority. As for living to a hundred years, it may as well be regarded as an auspicious sign and put aside.</p>
<p>The great enemies of normal lifespan are nothing more than the disasters of war, plague, and natural disasters such as floods and droughts. If wars are excluded, then people in countries with well-developed sanitation administration will live out their full years relatively more often; there are no other miraculous life-extending tonics or resurrection herbs. As for the elixir of immortality and the art of returning to youth, Qin Shi Huang and Emperor Wu of Han sought them in vain, and with the rapid development of science, there is still no way to obtain them in this world. From a logical point of view, immortality and returning to youth are impossible. Once they are possible, it would be a step backward, a regression. Why is that? Originally, we were already returning to youth before we aged; we were already being reborn before we died – still referring to our having children or even grandchildren! We have already handed over the major responsibility of immortality and returning to youth to a part of our organs – the reproductive organs – for full management, which is still a division of labor, a phenomenon of progress. If we live to seventy years old and take some kind of golden elixir, and then suddenly transform into an infant, competing with our grandchildren for milk, wouldn't that be superfluous? If after taking the elixir, one me turns into two me's, two me's turn into four me's, and continue to transform in this way, then it would be equivalent to fission, degenerating to the extreme. Or, one might say, we should stay at the age of twenty or thirty. Hey! The legal age for the President of the Republic of China is forty years old. This is clearly an illegal statement. In addition, the characteristic of life is uninterrupted material exchange; stagnation is impossible. Jin Shengtan, in his preface to *Romance of the Western Chamber*, says it very powerfully in the chapter on lamenting the ancients: that's right, the me of today is no longer the me drawn yesterday; some cells die and some cells are born, this is uninterrupted material exchange. Before the moment of death arrives, he is already grieving; this is where Shengtan's intelligence surpasses others.</p>
<p>Under the same sanitary environment, there are still inconsistencies in human lifespan, which is related to heredity. It turns out that lifespan has a lineage; after having a lifespan lineage, even if the body is weak, one often enjoys old age. The lifespan of various animals has a considerable range. For example, turtles live for about two hundred years and dogs live for about thirty years. This is the nature of the created lineage. All turtles generally have that lifespan, and all dogs generally do not exceed that lifespan. Sanitation cannot equalize the lifespans of the two.</p>

<p>— Rong Ren</p>
<p>The iron lung has long been successfully tested and can cure diseases. Now there is another machine that can replace the functions of the heart and lungs. In the future, if the heart and lungs are accidentally damaged, life may have a way to be prolonged. This machine is being tested in a US laboratory and has already been proven to prolong the lives of animals.</p>
<p>The function of the mechanical heart-lung is roughly as follows. A tube is inserted into a vein, and an electric pump draws the blood out, then a transmission vessel shoots it to the mechanical lung. The transmission vessel is encased in a glass tube; hot water flows continuously between the inner and outer tube walls, maintaining the temperature of the blood. The mechanical lung is a chrome-plated copper cylinder that rotates rapidly, several hundred times per minute. Because of this rapid rotation, the blood is sprayed onto the inner wall of the cylinder, forming a conductive film, which easily absorbs the oxygen passing through the cylinder cavity. After the blood is cleansed by oxygen, it is sent back into the animal's body by the pump. This is the same procedure as the blood in a healthy human body, from the heart, through the veins, to the lungs, where it is cleansed by the oxygen in the lungs, and then returns to the heart through the veins. In the attached diagram, the cylinder on the left is the artificial lung. The slanting glass tube in the center stores warm water to keep the blood at the proper temperature.</p>

<p>— Xi Wu</p>
<p>We usually think that the Earth's poles receive less sunlight than the equator. But strangely enough, the opposite is actually true. Because sunlight is refracted by the atmosphere when it hits the Earth, the sun can still be seen at the poles even when it has set below the horizon. According to scientists' calculations, this refraction effect can increase the amount of sunlight by 105 hours per year at the Earth's poles, but only increases it by 40 hours at the equator. In other words, the poles receive 65 more hours of sunlight per year than the equator.</p>

<p>The American Kodak film company consumes five tons of silver per week to produce photographic emulsion. Except for the country's mint, this company consumes the most silver. But in 1885, this company only consumed forty pounds of silver per week.</p>
<p>Currently, 80% of the world's silver production comes from Mexico, Canada, Peru, and the United States. But apart from the silver produced in Mexico, most of the new silver does not come from silver mines, but rather as a byproduct of lead, copper, and zinc mines.</p>

<p>Automatic Parachute</p>
<p>Recently, someone has manufactured an automatic parachute that even novices can use, because it can open automatically, without the parachutist nervously pulling the release cord. Its cover has a bag that can "catch" the airflow and open the parachute. But if the rider wishes, they can also pull the cord as usual to open the parachute. This parachute is twenty-four feet in diameter, two feet shorter than ordinary parachutes. The rider only needs to pull a guide rope to make the parachute descend in the specified direction, so it is easier to control than ordinary parachutes.</p>

<p>Torpedo That Can Turn Back</p>
<p>Elliso S. Purington of Massachusetts, USA, has recently invented a torpedo that can turn back if it misses and attack the target again. This invention has been registered with the Patent Office.</p>
<p>The secret of this new underwater weapon is a line (metal wire) that is towed behind the torpedo. When the torpedo attacks an enemy ship and misses, passing in front of the ship, and this towed line comes into contact with the ship, it completes an electrical circuit, and the torpedo immediately turns around and attacks a second time. The direction it turns depends on the direction of the enemy ship. This second attack is unlikely to miss, because the torpedo is closer to the target this time.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Will it End Without Resolution? <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Watching the European situation for the past few days, some people feel that it seems to be tending towards a resolution without resolution.</p>
<p>Roosevelt asked Germany and Italy if they could refrain from invading other countries for ten or twenty-five years. Mussolini gave a vague speech as a reply. Although Hitler has not replied yet, looking at the preparations he has been hurriedly engaged in these days, they are nothing more than an attempt to prevaricate with Roosevelt. A direct and clear answer is also certain to be absent. This is one.</p>
<p>Chamberlain saw that Albania had been annexed and that other small countries were about to suffer the same fate, directly threatening the British Empire itself. Therefore, he hurriedly promoted anti-aggression alliances and strengthened collective security organizations. The initial situation seemed to be progressing smoothly, and everything could be resolved satisfactorily. Unexpectedly, Poland is now wavering, and Britain itself still has not changed its attitude of suspicion and hesitation towards the Soviet Union. No one can say what the future holds. This is two.</p>
<p>The British ambassador to Germany, Henderson, returned to his country before because Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, as a demonstration. Now he has been allowed to return to Berlin. Within two or three days, the French ambassador to Germany, Coulondre, will also follow suit. They have already embellished the reasons for their departure. Therefore, they can only force themselves to justify Germany's acts of aggression. This is three.</p>
<p>In addition, some other chaotic phenomena have led some people to form the impression that the European situation may just pass in this way, without resolution. This is really unavoidable.</p>
<p>So, will the European situation really end without resolution? If not, what will the future hold?</p>
<p>I say, no, definitely not. The European situation will definitely not end here. It is currently in a period of brewing another major disturbance. The time of its unveiling may not be far away. Because the fascist countries have not given up on aggression, and the democratic countries still cannot cooperate thoroughly, the friction and agitation between the two are ultimately unavoidable.</p>
<p>As for the result of this disturbance, it is naturally still impossible to predict. It still depends on whether the democratic front is strong and whether there is a clear determination to deter fascist aggression. Therefore, during this period, we can only pay close attention to various developments and listen to the next installment.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Package <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Fang</p>
<p>District Chief Zhou knew that Sergeant Yi was asking him to go on patrol outside the city, and he was very unwilling. He held a bowl of white fungus soup and stirred it non-stop with a small silver spoon, staring blankly at the white, steaming vapor, lost in thought. Concubine Wang leaned against the door, watching with amusement. She casually flicked the light switch, and the room immediately darkened. District Chief Zhou startled and pushed the bowl away from the table, wanting to dodge, but he heard a string of flirtatious laughter. He realized it was Concubine Wang. Then the light came back on, and he sat down again. Concubine Wang, gaily dressed, rushed over. District Chief Zhou picked up the bowl again and said, both angry and loving:</p>
<p>"This kind of joke isn't funny. The police chief was just assassinated, and my life is hanging in the balance. Don't just mess around..."</p>
<p>"Stop it, who told you to take this stinking job!" Concubine Wang came closer, opening her mouth, her powdered face white and red. Then she asked, "Is it sweet enough?"</p>
<p>District Chief Zhou tremulously offered a spoonful and delivered it to Concubine Wang's mouth. Outside the door, Zhang Ma lightly called, "Sir!"</p>
<p>District Chief Zhou hastily pushed Concubine Wang away, put down the bowl, and solemnly asked:</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>Zhang Ma solemnly held a paper package, walked to the table, and presented it to District Chief Zhou with both hands. Concubine Wang took it, but immediately placed it on the table, her lips curling:</p>
<p>"Agh, it's so heavy!"</p>
<p>District Chief Zhou examined the package while listening to Zhang Ma:</p>
<p>"The doorman sent it in, saying it was delivered by a young man. When asked if he wanted a receipt, he said no, no, and turned around and left."</p>
<p>A young man, not wanting a receipt, with no writing on the package, and so heavy! He trembled as he carefully untied the rope, but the knot was tight, and he couldn't untie it for a while. Concubine Wang lost patience and snatched it over, wanting to tear it open, clumsily and heavily. District Chief Zhou became anxious and hurriedly pressed Concubine Wang's hand:</p>
<p>"Be careful, be careful, it might be a bomb!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, Concubine Wang was frightened and withdrew her hand, rushing over to hug District Chief Zhou, her powdered face pale, scolding Zhang Ma:</p>
<p>"Why didn't you ask clearly where it came from? What's inside? And you just brought it in so carelessly..."</p>
<p>District Chief Zhou frowned, reaching out to still untie the knot, constantly saying:</p>
<p>"Don't make a fuss, don't make a fuss, how can that be! If it's not a bomb, won't people laugh at us to death! If it spreads to the squad, they'll have even more to mock. The doorman is also absurd, why didn't he ask clearly?"</p>
<p>Concubine Wang blocked him with both hands, not allowing him to move. The two were in a chaotic mess.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the phone on the wall rang. Zhang Ma went to answer it, holding the receiver high, calling:</p>
<p>"Sir, a phone call from Counselor Zhao's residence."</p>
<p>Concubine Wang jumped up, released District Chief Zhou, rushed over, took the receiver, pressed it to her ear, and gasped:</p>
<p>"Oh, it's you, hey, it's me... Asked who sent it? What?... Braised beef from Da Ting?... Okay, okay, received it, but haven't opened it yet. Why didn't you bring it yourself?... Oh! Okay, is the master in? Asleep..."</p>
<p>District Chief Zhou snatched it over, but she had already hung up the receiver, laughing, patting District Chief Zhou's shoulder, saying:</p>
<p>"Little Zhao came from Beijing, bringing braised beef from Da Ting. He had his nanny's son deliver it. That child is naive, put it down and left without asking for a receipt. He was worried, so he called to ask."</p>
<p>District Chief Zhou breathed a sigh of relief. Zhang Ma understood, took the white fungus soup bowl, and quietly retreated.</p>

<p>— Wen Zongshan</p>
<p>The heart is carved from crystal and glass, and heart's words, like its radiance, forever shine in the darkness.</p>
<p>After a robber steals objects, or a petty thief snatches small things, on the surface, they will congratulate themselves on their victory, but in their hearts, they are still warning themselves: "This is danger, extreme danger, a dark shadow is reaching out to grab you!" Heart's words always follow unchanging laws, treat themselves with honesty, and never use deception or concealment to ridicule and bully others.</p>
<p>Anyone, in the evening or morning, certainly has heart's words monitoring them, heart's words questioning them; after doing wrong, they then repent.</p>
<p>Heart's words are like a great bell, using a huge sound to awaken the deaf and enlighten the blind. When we do things that are righteous and just, it will be happier than you. Conversely, all evil deeds will cause it to advise and scold you first.</p>
<p>When a person falls into the abyss of "profit" and "position," heart's words are like a grass rope that will forever hold onto them. However, the heavy body itself does not pull back its feet. As a result, it still falls, and drowns.</p>
<p>When an aggressor picks up a full glass of fine wine to celebrate "victory," heart's words leap in its chest, saying: "Danger! Failure! Danger! Failure!"</p>
<p>Friends, what words are your hearts warning you of every day?</p>

<p>— Ya Lu</p>
<p>Not contrary to the Three Principles of the People, not contrary to the government's laws and decrees, not contrary to the interests of the nation and the people – these are the first three of the twelve articles for the people in the General Mobilization of the National Spirit Outline. Anyone who understands the meaning of the General Mobilization of the National Spirit will certainly not overlook these two questions.</p>
<p>For conditions that are beneficial to the nation and the people, not having any actions that are contrary can certainly be considered a good citizen, but strictly speaking, in this time of war, merely achieving the extent of not being contrary seems insufficient. We must go a step further and earnestly implement the Three Principles of the People, the government's laws and decrees, and matters that increase the interests of the nation and the people.</p>
<p>However, if we want to implement these three tasks, we must have a deep understanding of them. First, we must know that the Three Principles of the People is the principle of saving the nation, because its goal is first to seek the liberation of the nation, second to seek the freedom of civil rights, and third to seek equality of people's livelihood. Currently, the most important task for China is the war of resistance for national liberation. Once the nation is liberated, the freedom of civil rights and the equality of people's livelihood can be easily solved. But if we want to implement the Three Principles of the People, we must recognize our country's position, enhance our national consciousness, and more importantly, have a spirit of loyalty to the country, loyalty to work, and loyalty to the people, and contribute our talents and resources as much as possible to the struggle for national liberation.</p>
<p>The second point regarding the government's laws and decrees is that we must not only not violate them, but also do our best to implement them. The General Mobilization of the National Spirit Ordinance is the most urgently needed to be implemented at the current stage. Chairman Chiang had already said: "After the War of Resistance has entered the second phase, the enemy is already in a dilemma militarily, becoming more and more embarrassed and more and more at a loss every day; recently, the enemy has focused on political manipulation, fabricating facts, and alienating the people, with no other purpose than to subdue our spirit first, decompose our spirit, and then conquer our entire nation..." Therefore, with this General Mobilization of the National Spirit Ordinance, it should be sufficient to inspire the people's aspirations, enhance the people's understanding of the country, strengthen the people's belief in victory, and revitalize the people's spirit of resistance, so that the enemy's political conspiracies and means of shaking and numbing will have nowhere to use their tricks.</p>
<p>The third point is to implement the issue of enhancing the interests of the nation and the people. To view personal interests as higher than the interests of the nation and the people is truly a selfish and self-interested concept. The ancients said, "When the skin is gone, what will the hair attach to?" This means that the people and the country have a relationship of mutual dependence. If the country reaches a point where it cannot survive, the people will not be able to enjoy the benefits of living and working in peace, and will be treated as slaves. Therefore, the interests of the country should be regarded as higher than everything else. China is now resisting aggression for survival, and we should concentrate our efforts on all work that is beneficial to the country's interests. Because after the country is restored, the people will be able to enjoy endless benefits.</p>
<p>The War of Resistance will surely be victorious, and the nation-building will surely be successful. We must earnestly implement the General Mobilization of the National Spirit, not only not be contrary to it.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Random Mountain Musings <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>I went to the mountains not to recuperate, nor did I intend to write articles; therefore, for lodging, I did not look for desolate, ruined temples and ancient monasteries, and there was no need for "deep flowers and trees in the Zen room."</p>
<p>"It has been a long time, not just a day" - the scholars of the world seem to have generally agreed on this: poverty can cause illness; illness can illuminate one's writing. It seems that one must be poor to get sick, and one must be sick to speak of "fighting wits like a trapped beast" and achieve the effect of "work." And without mountains, one would be letting down one's impoverished bones and diseased body. Moreover, not only would it be insufficient to make the article magnificent and powerful, but there would also be no place to use one's tenderness and attachment; it's as if...</p>
<p>Therefore, mountains belong to the noble, the refined, and the men of letters. To say that mountains are a treasure trove of articles, and that the key of illness is needed to unlock them, may not be impossible!</p>
<p>However, I have never envied the batch of by-products harvested from the high mountains, flowing water, sickbeds, and dregs of medicine, which are said to be satisfactory. However, if an article is to be "well-crafted," it should first be able to withstand "poverty"; "poverty" must be able to endure illness; and "illness" must go to the mountains to open up the path of writing. This seems to be the only consistent shortcut for a group of literati throughout the ages to rise to prominence and achieve success.</p>
<p>But I have none of these. Even if I am poor, I am not willing to boast of my poverty to achieve an effect of elegance through reverse propaganda; although how can one "express one's aspirations," and without sick moans, one is unlikely to be willing to muddle through. Moreover, relying solely on a few ribs of pleurisy, even if one can really go to the edge of the literary world for a stroll, one still has to beware of stumbling blocks, which could overwhelm one's weak body, perhaps harming the text and misleading the world!</p>
<p>Therefore, I am very ashamed to enter the mountains this time, because there is no reason at all to be ill. Going to the mountains without illness seems like a nominal position, receiving pay for nothing, and not doing any work. However, damn it, once I enter, I enter so deeply. Although the predecessors advocated "entering the mountains, fearing not to go deep enough," I, who have no intention of "building a famous mountain career," always feel in vain! Even if no one criticizes me for wasting the overlapping mountains and secluded valleys, I often feel a little ashamed of "holding a position without contributing" to the nodding peaks and emerald-green, affectionate wasp waists and crane knees, because I have not "worked hard while sick." Even if not, the stubborn spirit of refusing to "avoid the path of inflammation" (inflammation refers to all bronchitis or pleurisy) has already committed the unpardonable sin of pretending to be cultured!</p>
<p>If there is any truth to the saying that a sound career resides in a sound body, then at least writing an article requires a sound body; a good article requires a good body, so what does lung disease and spitting blood have to do with it?</p>
<p>Thinking of Sima Qian ascending Mount Tai and peeping into Mount Kongtong, it was probably not a "lying travel," and besides, there was no road network at that time, and there would not have been cars winding up to the top of the mountain like those in Huangyan, Taizhou, or the Yunnan-Guizhou area, so the grandeur of the article still depended on a vigorous spirit and light feet.</p>
<p>Although some people say that it was the melancholy after his mutilation that dispersed into writing, we must not underestimate that "palace punishment." Which of the world's many literati does not covet women, which one does not play with women, writing erotic passages, and passing on the splendor and extravagance to future generations? Naturally, "write what you are familiar with" is a dogma of predecessors enlightening later students, but being familiar with the powder team and praising the snow-white thighs in a "deviation together and reversal" manner is ultimately a foolish thing that is difficult and unrewarding.</p>
<p>Although I do not advocate that everyone can write articles only after being "palace punished," poverty and disease do not necessarily produce good works; therefore, my entry into the mountains this time has nothing to do with these, and the opening remarks of the random mountain musings have actually led to these irrelevant and illogical thoughts, which is unavoidable.</p>

<p>— Jing Lu</p>
<p>The Yi Feng Drama Troupe is the most sound and progressive troupe in the Peking Opera circle in Shanghai. Under the leadership of the troupe leader, Zhou Xinfang, all the members are advancing along the right track, showing their foresight everywhere, and always running ahead of their fellow actors. Recently, they felt that all circles were donating money or buying goods to comfort the lone army of the Four Banks, but only the acting circle had never expressed anything to these loyal and brave soldiers, so they initiated a donation to make a visit of condolence.</p>
<p>After everyone generously donated, a total of thirty-two yuan and thirty cents were raised. Although it was a very small amount, their spirit is worthy of admiration. They took this money to Yutai and bought twenty catties of tea, and the day before yesterday at 3 pm, five gentlemen, Li Wenjun, Cao Mukun, Wang Zhonghu, Wang Peichen, and Sun Delin, were sent as representatives to the lone army camp.</p>
<p>After they arrived at their destination, Regiment Commander Xie Jinyuan was unable to meet them due to illness, and was represented by a brave warrior Lei Xiong, a deputy battalion commander and company commander, who expressed his admiration for their enthusiasm and reported in detail the heroic experience of resisting the enemy in the Four Banks. Finally, he issued a receipt for receiving twenty catties of tea. The five representatives visited inside for a week, and after asking the warriors to sign the commemorative album, they bid farewell and returned with satisfaction.</p>
<p>When the Yi Feng Drama Troupe initiated the donation, Zhang Yipeng and Li Ruilai of the Grand Stage also expressed their willingness to join, but Yi Feng was visiting in the name of the troupe, so they did not accept it, and hoped that the comrades of the Grand Stage could also initiate a visit. Zhang and Li are both progressive young people, and of course they will not allow Yi Feng to monopolize the beauty. I further hope that the entire acting circle will automatically initiate it.</p>

<p>— Chan</p>
<p>"The Dictator," which is currently in production, is the most watched film, and the scope of attention is not limited to Hollywood, but to the world, and even Hitler is closely watching it.</p>
<p>"The Dictator" is attracting attention: first, because this is Chaplin's first film in four years since "Modern Times"; second, in this film, Chaplin officially speaks; third, in this film, there is a very humorous and sharp satire on the head of a certain dictatorship.</p>
<p>Regarding the film "The Dictator," this magazine has had several reports. In the past: all we knew was that the story of "The Dictator" would be set in a country ruled by a certain dictator. Chaplin plays two important roles in this film, one is a prisoner in a concentration camp, and the other is the dictator of this country.</p>
<p>At the beginning of March this year, the film was officially started. A reporter interviewed him about the news of the film and Chaplin's own opinions. At that time, Chaplin only said: "I don't want to tell you for the time being, but I would like to let you know that there will be a big scene in this film, which requires a lot of actors, and I would like to hire as many Jews and Germans as possible."</p>
<p>Now, Chaplin has publicly announced the content of "The Dictator." The script was written by an unknown British writer living in Los Angeles, and is named "The Dictator," and another name is: "The Story of a Small Fish in a World Full of Sharks." As for the plot? It is about the adventure story of a "fool" named Charlie.</p>
<p>The general situation of the story is like this:</p>
<p>"In 1912, the two countries of 'Batania' and 'Eria' went to war. 'Fool' Charlie was a soldier in the 'Batania' army. When the war ended, he was the only survivor in the team. When he returned to 'Battitude', the capital of 'Batania', everything had changed, and it was very different from before the war. One day, he was napping when he was suddenly awakened by a team of advancing troops who were whipping the people to 'support' the dictator Heel of the 'Batania' country. Startled, Charlie fled into a restaurant. The restaurant owner invited him to eat for free, but as a result, all the restaurant's furniture was destroyed by the advancing troops, and Charlie was sent to a concentration camp by the army. But one day he escaped, and from then on he had good luck. That day, the dictator Heel was on a private visit, and because the two looked alike, the guards mistook Charlie for their head, while the real dictator Heel entered the concentration camp on the charge of impersonating the head of state. Charlie had good luck, gave a speech to the people, and his beautiful speech made the whole country happy... The ending is: 'Fool' Charlie woke up from his dream and found that he was still detained in the concentration camp..."</p>
<p>After reading the content of this script, we already know who the satirical target of this film is. Of course, the jokes in the whole film must be very rich. No wonder that after Chaplin announced the general content of this film, the entire American movie fans paid more attention to this "Dictator."</p>
<p>This film started shooting in early March, and the larger one will be released in September this year. At that time, the movie fans' joy and the dictator's anger must be predictable. Let's wait and see!</p>

<p>(4) Shanghai Opera</p>
<p>Shanghai Opera is now popular for a while. Not only is it broadcasting, but also performing on stage is crowded. The reason is that it is a local style, and the lyrics are popular, so anyone can understand it. It is said that women love to listen to Shanghai Opera the most. The former Shanghai Opera was too vulgar, but now it has been improved a lot. Shanghai Opera is also called Dongxiang Tune, and also called Bentan. In the past, it was popular in small plays, but now it focuses on whole books. There are so-called four diamond king for singing Shanghai Opera, that is, Shi Chunxuan Shi Wenyun Xiao Wenbin Xiao Yuezhen Wang Xiaoxin Wang Yaqin Liu Ziyun Yao Suzhen, and many other famous ones, such as Fan Lingzeng Ding Huiqin Shi Xiaoying Wei Mingqi, etc.</p>
<p>(5) Singing</p>
<p>Most people who turn on the radio to listen to singing are young men and women and school students. Those old and confused people and kind grandmothers who recite the name of Buddha will never listen to singing. There are also a few songs that are very meaningful, and there are also a few songs that are too unconscious, and listening to them makes people feel numb, nothing more than love between men and women. We always hear the ladies who broadcast songs on the radio making a kind of giggling sound, unintentionally telling the audience that they are teasing their boyfriends who are ordering in the dark. These ladies who hope to broadcast songs should be more serious and don't make the audience hate them. Now there are many singing clubs popular in the broadcasting circle, such as Yiyou Club, Linlang Club, Comet Opera Club, Star Orchestra, Jialu Club, Brothers Club, Dawn Club, Phoenix Club, Liuying Opera Club, White Crane Club, China Club, Chinese Opera Club, Guangyi Club, Datong Club, Shanghai Club, Oriental Club, Wuyin Club, Era Club, Rongkang Club, Liangyou Club, Jazz Club, Zhiyin Club, Baiguang Club, etc., among which the Jazz Club has the oldest brand and the most talents.</p>
<p>(6) Siming Storytelling</p>
<p>The audience of Siming Storytelling are mostly old grandmothers who eat vegetarian food and recite the name of Buddha. Compared with singing, it is the opposite. The scripts that are broadcast are all stories of cultivating immortals, attaining Taoism, and exhorting good and punishing evil. The plot is consistent, and it does its best to perform the joys and sorrows of separation and reunion, persuading the world and promoting morality, which also attracts the attention of the general good men and women. It also occupies a considerable position in the broadcasting circle. The strong players in this area are Zhang Renxin, He Guizhang, Li Maochun, Zai Gongxia, Tang Jianying, Zhao Xiaoben, Bao Xiaowen, and Xiao Xianmin, etc. Zhang Renxin has the most tricks, and the Ningbo audience is mostly obsessed with him.</p>
<p>(7) Siming Art</p>
<p>Siming Opera, that is, Ningbo Tanhuang, also known as Yongtan, used to be vulgar and unbearable, but since it entered the broadcasting circle, it has been slightly reformed, but when performing on stage, it relapses. If the host can gradually improve it, it may not be a good local opera. Those who can stand in the broadcasting circle are Xiao Fengxian, Sun Cuie, Chuan Caixia, and Jin Cuixiang, etc., who sing more elegantly.</p>
<p>(8) Southern Opera</p>
<p>Southern Opera, also known as Southern Opera, did indeed shine on the radio a few years ago, but because it stuck to the old and did not reform, it has now failed. The only survivors are Gu Bingcheng, Zhang Bingren, and Yang Bingzhang. Compared with the era of rising wind and clouds in the past, the vicissitudes of the world are really sighing.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Talking About Old Books and Old Dramas — The Complete Battle of Puguan <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Jiangfeng</p>
<p>The "Battle of Puguan" in old dramas originally included the sections of the young master escaping from disaster, being besieged and moving troops, until the aid arrived and the thieves were captured. This drama is the most wonderful historical masterpiece, but unfortunately, very few people perform it now, and even if there are, they mostly only sing the section of Wang Ba killing his concubine to reward the army. The famous female actress Zhang Eyun is excellent in singing and martial arts. She specially connects the historical facts of Liu Xiu's wife Guo, Wang Ba's concubine Xu Yanzhen, the garrison general of Puguan, and Geng Chun's son Geng Er, and makes them the central characters. After a long period of research, this drama is reorganized into the most magnificent historical drama, with extremely complex literary and martial arts interludes. Eyun personally plays two roles, namely Xu Yanzhen, Wang Ba's concubine in the first part, and Geng Er in the latter part. The role of Geng Er is of a cross-dressing young man nature. Like this, suddenly wearing a hairpin and suddenly wearing a hat, both literary and martial, one person plays two roles with different styles, which can be called heavy and strenuous, and the courage is amazing. In today's female actress team, there may be no one who is more courageous than Zhang Eyun, who is not afraid of fatigue. The plot is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>After the Han Dynasty destroyed Mang, the generals were afraid of Liu Xiu's Yingming and established Liu Xuan as emperor, and sealed Xiu Xiao Wang. Xiu conquered Hebei, and Liu Penzi, the king of the Chimei, attacked Chang'an. Xuan's minister Hu Ying surrendered, Liu Xuan fled, and Liu Xiu's generals Pi Tong and Wan Xiu protected Xiu's two sons and fled to Puguan. Geng Chun protected Xiu's wife Guo and Yin and also escaped. Liu Penzi besieged Puguan very urgently, and Tong wrote a letter asking for help. Wang Ba, the garrison general of Puguan, defended day and night. When the food ran out and the army was about to collapse, he killed his concubine Xu Yanzhen and his servant Liu Zhong to reward the soldiers. Pi Tong and Wan Xiu met Geng Er, Geng Chun's son, on the way, and used wisdom to inspire him. Geng Er sent troops to rescue Puguan and killed Hu Ying, and the park was relieved.</p>
<p>This is an old book and old play, which has been reorganized by Zhang Xianyuan. This is a great masterpiece, which is enough to show Zhang's talent. The complete list of dramas is attached to the decision, Liu Penzi's soldiers committed crimes in Chang'an, Pi Tong Wanxiu protected the master and escaped, Mrs. Guo left the palace to avoid disaster, the thieves surrounded Puguan, General Wang killed his concubine to serve the country, Xu Zhenniang committed suicide with a sword, Wisdom Pi Tong cleverly inspired the young general, Yong Geng Er defeated the Chimei.</p>

<p>— (Peng Lu)</p>
<p>Since Wang Hanlun and Zhou Meimei of the Xianle Dance Palace on Jing'an Temple Road have been playing the latest world-renowned songs by the singing saint Luo Ping and Miss Jin Sangzi Carmen, the grand occasion has been in vain every night. Starting last night, the contemporary famous stars Miss Wang Hanlun and Miss Zhou Meimei have returned to the palace to dance. According to the two red stars, Wang Zhou was originally waiting for education in the palace, but since she stopped dancing due to illness, it has been a long time. Now that she has recovered and danced again, she is more charming and healthy than in the past. Also, the giant star Huang Dimeidi (ie, Didi of Haishu Building) who is popular in Hong Kong and Shanghai is approved to return to the palace for dancing tomorrow (26th), which is really good news for the dance country.</p>
<p>Dance Country's Pride Xiao Meili The dancer Xiao Meili in the Central Dance Hall can truly be called the pride of the dance country. She always shines brightly and never dims a bit. The conditions for the success of a red dance star are multifaceted. Xiao Meili has such a position because she has a clear voice and a slender figure, and at the same time her dancing skills are also pure and she treats people kindly. Recently, Xiao Meili's Fangzi suddenly disappeared from the dance floor of the Central Dance Hall, which naturally made people suspicious. Could it be that Xiao Meili disappeared? Some said that she had been hired by someone to hide in the Golden House. However, these rumors and rumors are not accurate. The reflection of the facts is that she will still re-enter the Central Dance Hall for dancing tonight (26th), which will of course make the comrades in the dance country ecstatic.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Characters in Small Theaters (Middle) <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Man Fu</p>
<p>Chang Le's Department</p>
<p>The Chang Le Theater was created in the autumn of last year. The front desk is hosted by amateur actors Xu Yanqiu and Jin Yongjian. It is of course remarkable to run a "small theater" as an amateur actor. The roles recruited are very good, but the base is too weak.</p>
<p>Le Di is a disciple of Chou Yuexiang. Chou is the enlightenment teacher of Meng Xiaodong, a female actor and Lao Sheng master. It is not true that Le Di and Meng Xiaodong are sisters, but they are actually fellow apprentices. Her singing is better than her acting. The play "Visiting Mother and Returning to Order" is always sold out every time it is performed. The rest, such as "Going to Heaven" "Zhuli Zhai" and "Qi Yuan Bao" are all called her specialties, and people in the know all praise it.</p>
<p>Zhu is also a female actor and Lao Sheng. Her acting is better than her singing. The plays of the Qipai style, such as "Chasing Letters" "Running the City" "Sweeping Pines" and "Fighting Song", are very good. She is only nineteen years old and is the daughter of the famous "Begonia Red" who used to be famous in the chrysanthemum department.</p>
<p>Dong Zhilan plays Qingyi Hua Dan. She is the palm pearl of the famous martial artist Xiao Lanting. She is not very well-dressed, but her voice is very good. She does not study the words well. In the play Magu Xian Shou, she steps on a giant ball with both feet, and dances a silver plate with each index finger. It is rare among female actors.</p>
<p>Hua Meirong is eighteen years old, and her appearance is like Zhang Wenqin, a famous female actor in Jiangnan. She is the niece of the famous teacher Ma Baogang and the pianist Ma Baoge. Her art is taught by her aunt Hua Xiangrong. Her dress and voice are both acceptable. She learned drama at the age of twelve, and performed on stage at the Kaiming Grand Theater in Suzhou at the age of fifteen. From Xiao Guanghan to Era, and then to Chang Le, she has many years of stage experience. Recently, she worshiped Xu Yanqiu as her adoptive father. Her Qingyi plays are better than her Hua Dan plays.</p>
<p>Xin Yanlou, whose real name is Xin Yanlou, is a female martial artist and martial artist. Her fighting is extremely "strong" and "killing". Some people praise her as the female Liu Hanchen, but unfortunately she is meticulous in her voice and is not good at singing.</p>
<p>Wang Cuiyun is the daughter of Wang Yuanneng, the originator of the solo comic opera. She learned Qingyi Hua and Dan, but unfortunately she learned drama too late. She only started at the age of eighteen, and came on stage at the age of nineteen. She performed in Jiangxi and came to Shanghai the following year to join the Xinxin Stage for a year. She is now twenty-three years old. She looks better when she is undressed than when she is dressed up. Wang Yuanneng was famous in the Shanghai entertainment industry in the past, and he was called "a generation of artists". His orphan does not pass on his mantle, but is frustrated in a small theater, and is not valued by others. She is pitiful and her situation is also pitiful.</p>
<p>Fu Lixia and Fu Cuixia, one is seventeen years old and the other is fourteen years old. They are female disciples of Fu Xianfang, a former Lao Dan. They both learn Dan. At first, they learned art from Xianfang's daughter Yunxia. Lixia is quite skilled in martial arts, and can sing and perform in dramas such as "Thirteen Sisters" and "Rainbow Pass". After Yunxia married and died suddenly, her plays were taught by Xianfang himself. As for Cuixia, because she is still young, she only borrows the stage to sing.</p>
<p>Gui Yunfeng was a famous female martial artist 20 years ago, and was as famous as Zhang Wenyuan and Zhang Shaoquan. Later, she changed to Xiaosheng. From the perspective of stage experience, she can be called a senior among female Xiaosheng.</p>
<p>The rest, such as Yang Chunyan, Hu Baoting, and Liu Shaochun, are all commendable. The Chang Le Theater is relatively small, but the front and back stages are very harmonious, and the business is very prosperous. It is said that the owner of the theater will improve the seats from May 1st for the sake of innovation, and replace all of them with leather-padded new chairs, which is a highlight for small theaters, and will also invite famous characters to strengthen the lineup.</p>

<p>(Seen in the Shen Bao of the fourth month of the eleventh year of Tongzhi, Qing Dynasty)</p>
<p>Last night, the English Public Works Bureau held a meeting. Various merchants and gentry were present. The Consul took the floor and said: "The gathering of esteemed merchants and gentry here indicates several important matters, all of which are pressing current affairs. I urge you to carefully consider and thoroughly plan them. One of these is to raise the silted areas of the Huangpu Bund and build a road." The head of the English Public Works Bureau, Bao Shun Dong, rose and stated: "There are three options for filling the Huangpu: One, using water as a foundation, tightly draining the seabed to create a base that also resists water pressure, and then piling mud, sand, and stones to level it, which is estimated to cost 178,000 taels of silver. Two, using tightly packed stones as a base, combined with [illegible], to establish a foundation, and then completely filling it in, which is estimated to cost 255,000 taels of silver. As for building a charity bridge and providing a charity ferry at the mouth of the Wusong River, those costs are not included in these figures. For this project, we must first plan the necessary funds before we can proceed. Otherwise, it will be just empty talk." It was found that the Public Works Bureau collects a total of 220,000 taels in various donations each year, while annual expenditures amount to 206,000 taels, leaving a surplus of only 14,000 taels. Using this for the project would leave a significant shortfall. The matter was temporarily shelved, it was said.</p>

Due to the horse's speed, it was difficult to [illegible], resulting in a collision that broke the pipe into two pieces. The valve connected to the gas line could not be closed, causing gas to fill the air, obscuring the sky and moon like fog and clouds, causing a stir. Fearing a fire, everyone was terrified! It was not until the foreign police arrived that the carriage was apprehended. The driver's name was obtained, and he agreed to pay six silver dollars in compensation for the repairs. The gas leak was then sealed, and the carriage was allowed to leave.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Cotton Yarn - Hong Kong Dealers Actively Procuring - New High Prices Found in Cotton Yarn - 20-Count Double Horse Reaches 407 Yuan - Various Dealers Transact in Slightly Less Than 4,000 Bales With Counterparts <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The bullish trend in the yarn market has resurfaced, largely because demand from [illegible] dealers in South China remains weak. However, procurement from Guangxi dealers is robust. A certain Xing Firm from Guangdong is purchasing on their behalf, transporting the yarn from Guangzhou Bay, Beihai, and other places. The main focus is on the 20-count Double Horse and Flying Woman brands. Confidence is high, and the market is active. At the same time, inland cloth factories are also actively trading in medium-grade 20-count Chinese yarn. As for fellow merchants, in view of the improving environment, their buying sentiment has become even stronger. With this support, the market price has reached a new high in recent times. 20-count Double Horse foreign warehouse stock has risen to 405 yuan. In the afternoon, the market was unusually active, rising another two yuan. The spot price for Double Horse is now 407 yuan, matching the high prices seen in unofficial trading earlier this year.</p>
<p>The current state of yarn: At the opening bell this morning, the market was calm. Hong Kong dealers were actively looking to buy, and the opening price rose by 1.5 yuan. The spot price for 20-count Double Horse was 401.5 yuan. Shortly after, out-of-town dealers were particularly eager to buy in the market, focusing on the Double Horse and Flying Woman brands. Market sentiment immediately became tense, and trading was heavy. As a result, spot goods became increasingly scarce. Speculators, seeing the tight supply and difficulty in buying, rushed to buy warehouse warrants. The prices of spot goods and warehouse warrants rose one after another. By the closing price, 20-count Double Horse was 405 yuan, and the warehouse warrant price was 399 yuan. In the afternoon, because Hong Kong dealers still had [illegible], the price of Double Horse jumped another 2.5 yuan. It is estimated that all dealers bought a total of 3,945 bales throughout the day. The price of 20-count Double Horse rose 7.5 yuan, while other grades rose 2-3 yuan. The factory offered 500 bales of 7-count Red Wanzi from the New Life Factory at a price of 300 yuan, for July to September delivery. The Li Tai Factory offered 150 bales of 18-count Awake Lion at a price of 352.5 yuan, and another 400 bales at 354 yuan. Today, 410 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Tianjin, 80 pieces to Yantai, 135 pieces to Xiamen, 190 pieces to Shantou, 810 pieces to Hong Kong, 570 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 70 pieces to Beihai, and 670 pieces to Haiphong. The amounts purchased by each dealer are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 0; Counterparts: 990; Inland: 1,305</p>
<p>Tianjin: 365; Shantou: 345; Total: 3,945</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market, after days of heavy buying and squeezing, has become calmer and more relaxed. It is said that the factories are offering a large supply to meet the demand from all sides, which has helped to curb the bullish momentum. The price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn for this month is 373 yuan, and for next month, 375 yuan, a decrease of 2-3 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e141">The Cotton Yarn Market Has Been Thriving Last Week <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>During the week from the 16th to the 22nd, the cotton yarn market continued to advance, and the bullish trend was strong. Due to the favorable situation, confidence has been boosted, and the demand for cotton yarn and cotton cloth from South China has been continuous. This has significantly improved the actual situation, and the yarn market has been thriving. The peak price for 20-count Double Horse yarn reached 404 yuan (note: yesterday it reached 407 yuan), a new high for this year. However, by the weekend, the situation in Fujian Province became tense, and yarn and cloth shipments were suddenly suspended. The market situation suffered a setback, and prices weakened. As a result, 20-count Double Horse yarn still rose by 3.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market was still relatively strong, and the number of transactions increased slightly. However, due to the ongoing efforts to evacuate the population in the Chaozhou and Shantou areas, procurement by dealers from that region was constrained, and freight services were suspended, resulting in a quiet market. However, with the high price of Japanese yarn, cotton mills in the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang have begun to purchase and use cheaper Chinese and English yarn. The volume of spot yarn traded during the week is listed below (unit: bales):</p>
<p>Counterparts: 4,875</p>
<p>South China: 4,070</p>
<p>Inland: 1,455</p>
<p>North China: 300</p>

<h3 id="e142">If U.S. Cotton Export Subsidies Are Implemented - Domestic Cotton Prices Will Become More Expensive - The Senate Is Said to Be Strongly Opposed - Local Cotton Transactions Limited to Small Quantities of White Bales - Another 30,000 Bales of Indian Cotton Arrived Yesterday <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The foreign cotton market: It was widely rumored in the New York cotton market yesterday that the U.S. government's newly established export subsidy of 2 cents per pound, capped at 7 million bales, will be implemented starting on July 1st. Details were reported in yesterday's Shen Bao. Dealers believe that with the implementation of export subsidies, the price of U.S. cotton sold abroad will be cheaper than other cotton due to government subsidies, and its export volume will increase significantly. Domestic cotton inventories will also decrease as a result, and U.S. cotton will regain its past prosperity. As a result, New York soared by 20 [illegible] pounds. Other cotton markets were greatly affected by the U.S. government's subsidized U.S. cotton export plan, and cotton prices fell across the board. Indian cotton fell sharply by 2 rupees, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 30 [illegible] pounds. If the U.S. cotton export subsidy can be implemented, New York will rise again, while the cotton markets in India, Egypt, and Liverpool will continue to fall. However, according to the latest news, a certain firm received a special telegram stating that the U.S. cotton export subsidy would not easily reduce U.S. inventories unless cotton prices were reduced to 9 cents upon export. At the same time, overseas buyers of U.S. cotton would receive a 2-cent subsidy, while domestic consumers of cotton in the United States would instead pay a higher price to buy U.S. cotton, creating a distorted situation. In the future, the United States may export U.S. cotton and import foreign cotton, because buying foreign cotton in the United States will be cheaper than buying U.S. cotton. Although the export subsidy proposal has been passed by the Department of Agriculture, according to a certain congressman, the Senate will strongly oppose this proposal. Therefore, there are still many difficulties in implementing this export subsidy.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market: Yesterday, due to the sharp rise in the New York cotton market, converted into legal currency, the price rose by 1.7 yuan. Factories adopted a wait-and-see attitude, awaiting future developments in Washington. However, a certain company still imported 2,000 bales of Brazilian cotton. Yesterday, Indian cotton fell by 5 jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell by 1.6 yuan. Prices were very cheap, but no transactions were reported. Many shipments arrived daily. Yesterday, another shipment of 30,000 bales of Indian cotton arrived. The factory delivery prices converted from yesterday's cotton market are calculated as follows:</p>
<p>The local cotton market was as sluggish as ever, and all parties had no significant needs. Factories have already purchased a large amount of Indian, U.S., and other cotton from overseas, which will soon arrive in Shanghai. Factory needs are more than met, so there is no urgent need to purchase local cotton. However, there are still small transactions in clean white cotton for blending and display with foreign cotton, but the quantity is small. The sources are very difficult to obtain, so the selling price is also hesitant and shows no potential, and there is nothing exciting to report. 228 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived from northern Jiangsu. The current state of spot cotton is recorded on the left:</p>
<h3 id="e143">Finance - Gold Prices Continue to Decline - Although Xiamen Dealers Are Buying - There Is No Significant Impact <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold speculative market conditions remained weak. Gold shops and money changers continued to sell off their positions, and silver shops also followed suit. Although a certain gold shop was buying on behalf of Xiamen dealers, the supply of funds was still ample, so the underlying trend was downward. As a result, the price fell by 4 yuan. However, the fluctuations in between were quite moderate, and trading was very limited. The turnover was 430 taels. The price of silver ornaments remained unchanged. The price of customs gold remained flat, while the price of standard English gold and other grades declined slightly.</p>
<p>Spot Speculative Market Falls Another 4 Yuan</p>
<p>This morning, the initial buying price for each bar (ten taels) was 2,063.5 yuan, but sellers were only willing to supply at 2,067-8 yuan. Both sides waited until 10:20 AM before a trade was made. Initially, a gold shop sold 50 taels to a spot gold shop at 2,067 yuan, the opening price, which was 2 yuan lower than yesterday afternoon's closing price.

<p>Dalian soybeans are transferred from Tianjin to Shanghai, which seems to be the same as exporting soybean oil from Kobe, so merchants can understand this kind of evasive tactic, but it is difficult to apply the law to make a living under other people's poisonous hands. Yesterday's market: In addition to Dalian soybeans falling by 0.05-0.1 yuan, the other beans were still stable. It is estimated that the current Dalian soybeans are 5 cars, and the price is 9.35-9.3 yuan.

<p>Factory Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot flour trading gradually expanded. In addition to the local retail activities of the domestic merchants, the goods previously purchased by the northern merchants have mostly been loaded and shipped, and the Tianjin-Shanghai exchange rate is gradually being unified, so wholesale transactions have become active.

The factory originally intended to call for higher prices, but some customers still felt the price was too high. In order to promote sales in the north, the original price of 4.85 yuan was still sold to northern merchants, accounting for an estimated 5-60,000 bags, and the southern local merchants also had 3-40,000 bags. The combined transaction volume reached around 100,000 bags. If retail sales continue to be active, factory offers may increase.</p>
<p>Foreign Flour</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign flour market situation was also apparently stable and secretly tight. The foreign quoted prices remain firm as before. New futures orders remain quiet. Spot foreign flour inventories still exist, but the supply of circulating goods on the market is lacking, because those who hold the goods are firmly unwilling to release them easily. It is heard that the mid-range brands must be priced at 5.45-5.5 yuan, and high-quality goods must be priced at above 5.6 yuan. Yesterday's new transactions, in addition to local retail sales, a wholesale transaction is also in negotiation. The market situation is relatively good due to the secretly tight factory offers, so the situation is quite firm.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>On the 26th, flour exports included 21,000 bags to Tianjin and 10,500 bags to Xiamen.</p>

After the flat and tired market situation turned tight the day before yesterday, yesterday there was still a residual wave at the start. The sellers' asking prices continued to rise, and the local and speculative sales markets were active, but they were not as enthusiastic as the day before yesterday. Therefore, although the market situation continued to rise, in addition to the high-quality [illegible] market rising by 0.1-0.15 yuan, the others such as [illegible], only improved by a few cents. The [illegible] River goods also only increased by about 0.1 yuan. [illegible] also became slightly tight. [illegible] suddenly became active, so the market price was brightened by 0.2-0.3 yuan.</p>

<p>Overseas silk markets saw Yokohama closed due to a holiday, and New York and Lyon both reported declines. Japanese silk, 83% quality, fell by 3 cents, and 75% quality fell by 4 cents.

Lyon Japanese silk fell by 2 francs, Shanghai silk A grade fell by half a franc, and B grade fell by 1 franc. Guangdong silk opened at the original price.</p>
<p>The local silk market was quiet yesterday. Yokohama's closure caused foreign firms' silk trade to lose its basis. With no remittances from overseas yesterday, manufacturers were also unwilling to send more silk telegrams, so the silk market saw no activity. This point implies the silk market's dynamics are turning toward a decline, which is a factor. Also, the lack of concrete measures for this spring's cocoon harvest is an important reason. In normal times, now would be the season for releasing this year's new silk, but after the war of resistance, it will inevitably be somewhat restricted.</p>
<p>On the 25th, 474 pieces of Huzhou silk, 100 pieces of silk waste, and 20 pieces of silk fabric were exported to Europe.</p>

Shanghai University saw this early on and created the Shanghai East Public Society specifically for the working class. In addition to establishing primary and secondary schools and charging low tuition fees so that the children of workers can generally receive education, it also has workers' night schools and obligatory schools for workers' children. There are also considerable facilities for sports, as well as reading rooms and libraries. At the same time, they often initiate various gatherings, either to promote worker education or to seek welfare for workers. Therefore, when talking about the Shanghai East Public Society, every worker living in the Yangshupu area knows about it.</p>
<p>The artillery fire of "August 13" destroyed Yangshupu, and 90% of the factories were destroyed. Workers had nowhere to work, and the school buildings of Shanghai University were used as battlefields. In a state of chaos, the Shanghai East Public Society followed Shanghai University and fled to the concession area. However, after the Shanghai East Public Society moved to the south bank of Suzhou River, although everything was destroyed, all work continued within the possible range. For example, the affiliated primary and secondary schools continued to borrow school buildings for classes, and the tuition fees charged were still cheaper than those of ordinary schools. At the same time, night schools also continued to open, and an automobile school was also attached.</p>
<p>Recently, we received another piece of news. The Shanghai East Public Society raised donations and opened four obligatory schools for apprentices: Central District: 5th Floor, Cishu Building, Shanghai University; Southern District: Municipal Middle School, 5 Wuma Road, Wuhu Road; Western District: Huamin Elementary School, Dongxin Zha Road, Maitehest Road; Northern District: Zhenru Elementary School, Lao Zha Bridge. Classes have begun one after another. Any apprentice can register for admission, tuition is completely free, and class time is from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM every night, which does not conflict with the apprentice's working hours. In advance, the Shanghai East Public Society also sent 50 investigators to various district stores to investigate the apprentices' education level and requested managers or shop owners to allow their apprentices to study. Promoting apprentice education is not only related to the apprentice's own future, but also helps improve business, which is indeed quite important. The author sincerely hopes that wise managers and shop owners will not hesitate to allow every apprentice to study and not miss this opportunity.</p>

<p>— Tiandao</p>
<p>Unless you are blind, if you have eyes, you must see. However, when something blocks your path of vision, you cannot overly trust your eyeballs. There is a term in optics called "optical illusion," which often "sees" long as short and round as square. Therefore, how to "see" things in front of you and how to "see" them is worth studying.</p>
<p>It is said that Shanghai people have quite a bit of study when it comes to "seeing." For example, when "seeing" the coronation of the British King, even the women's trousers were "seen" crystal clear. When a big fire burned behind Songshan Road, even people living near the Great World came out in droves to watch. Moreover, after "seeing" it, there were many discussions about how this woman was ashamed and blushing, and how that woman was screaming strangely. The tongues of fire were like crows flying in the air, and the water taps were like swimming dragons. The things "seen" in the eyes are indeed real and have no "optical illusion" reaction, but is it appropriate to "see" these things this way, and is this the way to "see" them? The so-called "quite a bit of study" is actually a lack of "study."</p>
<p>It is precisely because people who "see" lack study that the people being "seen" are showing more and more tricks. For example, clearly wanting to earn "three million," they insist, "How can I be greedy for profit?" Clearly it's "surrender," but they come up with a set of "avoiding mutual destruction" tricks. Others, such as "closing the door to study," etc., have no concrete expression and are no different from releasing smoke screens to make people "see" the tip of a bull's horn.</p>
<p>How to "see" and how to "see" are worth a great deal of study and research. Relying on your sharp eyes, you break through what is blocking the path of vision, seeing everything clearly and thoroughly. Even a charming and beautiful woman will have to reveal her true form on the spot as a vixen with a tail.</p>
<p>Unless you are blind, you must see if you have eyes, but you must see clearly and thoroughly? Moreover, even if you are blind, you still have ears. Listen to the "chirping," and you should know which kind of "stuff" it is.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Alas, Where Shall I Go? <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Gengbai</p>
<p>and Lixi</p>
<p>Alas, where shall I go? I shall go east. The waters of Fusang can cleanse my breast. I wish to kick the setting sun until it is red. Drive out all warriors and personally labor in the fields. Collect all the gold, silver, steel, iron, and copper from the Three Slopes. Japan and China are brothers. Why are there still weapons and warfare raging? The desires of the young are endless. The senior ministers and elders are deaf in both ears. They are evasive and embarrassed with merchants and workers. Financial resources are exhausted, and levies are heaped upon levies. The army is on the rise, and nine out of ten homes are empty. Women and old men long for their husbands and sons. Sibling rivalry makes my heart uneasy. Who says that China is sure to be defeated in a long war? I am like a centipede that is not yet dead. They are like a nouveau riche family facing disaster. The superficial only hear the roar of airplanes, cannons, tanks, and cars. Fear and doubt shake their bodies. How can I get a purple aura to rise in the Sun Palace? Millions of the hammer and sickle masses sing among them. The East joins hands with the same writing and language. Descendants of the Yellow Emperor embrace the Japanese wind. The flag of the Blue Sky and White Sun flies in the sky. Under the cherry blossoms, I get drunk and empty a thousand cups!</p>
<p>Alas, where shall I go? I shall go south. The Pacific wind is vast and the sky is blue. All colonial lands are my land, for two or three days I am a possession of France, England, or Holland. Together with the Philippines and Hainan Island, we remotely guard the gateway to the Far East. Tall-nosed crowds fill their jaws. The tongues of the Chinese people are restrained. The Far East's power struggle can be explored here. Demands and protection are like raising silkworms. Or like a runaway horse with a bridle. There is much injustice, how can the feelings be sweet? The people are also tired, and the money is in the boxes. Brown trees, coconut trees, and rubber trees are better than medlars and nanmu. Trees are only used for greedy purposes. I only hope that the motherland produces extraordinary men. The mighty and brave can conquer the barbarians. Recently, I heard the Imperial edict on the burden of fighting. The rich and the laborers are cut down and joined together. There are people like this who are made to drink squid. I sleep soundly in my bed, while others snore. To this day, they still stare covetously. How can the lords bear to think of it? My intestines are hot and my heart is ashamed. My mouth is willing to be like a golden man's sealed lips. I want to speak out, but those who hear it suspect I'm mad!</p>
<p>Alas, where shall I go? I shall go west. Europe is blocked by the sea, and whales roar. Tyrants and villains cannot be aligned. Taking the neighbor's [land] as their [own] nest is like a turtle stuck in the mud. Seventy-year-old men laugh and call out. The forces of combined chickens are hard to live together. The Polish Corridor is a ladder to heaven. I will not be at odds with Czechoslovakia and Romania. I will not share the same wind and rain with Yugoslavia and Lithuania. England and France look at them like clouds and rainbows. The Soviet Union treats them like a mistress. In today's world, we can only lower our heads to Stalin, Hitler, and Mussolini. The Near East has Turkey to support. Spain is a neighborhood by the sea. Who can build a golden dyke of hundreds of millions of miles beyond North America? American women have beautiful heads and soft hands. Young people hold slingshots and compete to be close to them. The musk eventually sees its navel burned because of its fragrance. How can there be a Peach Blossom Spring outside the world? I am afraid that the earth is like glass. A thunderbolt shatters them into pieces. What is called by the night air cannot be avoided by chance. When the quality exceeds the object's limit, look at the sign. Rebels roam the land and there are many caltrops. I want to sing, but my heart is miserable!</p>
<p>Alas, where shall I go? I shall go north. The workers and peasants raise their arms to defend this country. In the middle is the icy sky of Siberia and the sand and gravel of the Gobi Desert. The territory is ten thousand miles, growing yellow and white. In Liaodong, there are pigs that are full of jade food. The cranes return, their feathers red. Then distant relationships are restored and re-translated. Hu and Yue see each other in the same boat. Don't be moved by the changes of the world from the Song and Yuan dynasties. The power of revenge from Wu and Chu in Qin. The way to self-strengthening lies in unceasing effort. The five-year plan is near to the model. To organize the army and defend the people is useless. Being kind is enough to save from hunger and drowning. Don't you see the people of the Soviet Union all working as servants? They share the hardships with the people every morning and evening. Likes, dislikes, punishments, and rewards do not go against the people's will. Also, do not see that the country of the Soviet Union has no corrupt officials or a single person who daydreams about fame and color, jade and silk, or building mansions. The Black River water is turbid and the misty trees are straight. Birds fly quickly by Lake Hasan. There are many borders between the two continents, and the spring breeze of Yuguan sends the Qiang flute. The carriage travels even harder, spreading its wings to the sky. I want to follow them, but I am sad. My bag has no spare money for a heroic farewell. What age is this on earth, with iron and blood? Red flags and gold compete to rise and fall!</p>
<p>Alas, where shall I go? I shall go forward. The strong Chinese children are in Youyan. They are also in the mountains and rivers of the two rivers, the three Jin, the hundred Yue, and the Jianghuai. Guerrilla bravery is passed on by the masses. Who pities the Red Army who died for their cause? The Huangpu children are the first to pull out the flag. Brave divisions traveled in Sichuan and Yunnan. The Red Army can turn the right into the wrong. The system is exhausted, and Sun Lang has the power, and would rather be a jade than a tile. Continue to work hard and constantly destroy the strong. Comfort those who come and stretch out their fists. I want to follow them, but my heart is blank. It is not wise to kill the enemy with a short blade. It is bitter to say that young people are expelled. Otherwise, fly a book or draft a proclamation. I will sing a song for the strong children. I will broadcast the march for the strong children to the world. I have a writing style on the cliffs like a column. When I look at my reflection in the flowing water, I am still graceful. I slightly hate the two gray hairs on my sideburns. All my life, I wanted to fly into the sky. Forward, forward, why am I drowned in the dust of the city! I don't hear gunfire, I hear pipes and strings!</p>
<p>Alas, east, west, north, and south, there is nowhere to go. I want to go forward, but I am afraid that there are many obstacles on the road. Alas, where shall I go? I shall stay here. From winter to summer, the sky is sad. The fog is like a screen and the rain is endless. The red sun peels the skin as if in prison. The mountains and forests are suitable for hiding and searching. Sometimes it also makes people's minds gentle. Walking on the slopes often brings out the wild fun. The shade of the trees is green and all are fields. Getting sunshine can travel and clear my eyes. There are only a few good days in spring and autumn. The fruits are not big, but the mother doesn't demand too much. Guanggan is sweet and unparalleled. When drunk, I can moisten my throat. Hundreds of thousands of displaced people come to his state. The middle class often has worries. The rich and powerful still sing and dance. High carriages and soldiers mix with cow urine. The flying thieves do not come, and they are getting used to stealing more. When people hear exaggerations, they shout in crowds. If they win, they are surprised and suspicious, and if they lose, they turn their heads. These people have never thrown themselves into the turbulent stream. A retired official idles away my plan. Half a bowl of rice supports two years a week. Also, it is said that the official is big and I want to be ashamed. The great men are tigers, and today the cuckoos nest in them. The country is shabby, and shields and spears are in sight. Alas, grass and beans are used to restrain Huailiu!</p>
<p>Editor's note: Mr. Lin Gengbai entered Chongqing after the war. Now, in the "Selected Poems of Today," "Alas, Where Shall I Go?" is his recent work. The author wrote in a letter to a friend: "The six chapters of the long song are very satisfying to me. I think it is an epoch-making work, which the ancients have never had. Do you think it is an exaggeration?" It can be seen that he is generally satisfied with himself.</p>

<p>Chapter 8: Is It Illusion or Truth? Acting on the Stage, It Is Appropriate to Move Forward or Stop, Making Home Everywhere</p>
<p>Jin Dànyún was very happy and said: "Mrs. Sūlǐyǎ, since this is the case, why don't you manufacture a car yourself first? To have all the equipment complete and without any shortcomings, let us open our eyes. As for your friend's car, we must first borrow it for a ride, or maybe that kind of car is not easy for us to drive?" Mrs. Sūlǐyǎ said: "Aren't we currently planning to start an automobile manufacturing company? We want to invite many engineers to come. Our company will gather many engineers to design the most suitable family car for China. Because now, although it is said that the four seas are one family, each country has different customs and habits. We don't want to imitate others. We want to come up with our own ideas and manufacture the most excellent design. Do you think that's good?" Jin Dànyún was even more excited when she heard this, and said: "That's great! Mrs. Sūlǐyǎ, but when we manufacture that kind of car, will it be exclusively for our own comfort, or will it be popularized among the public?" Mrs. Sūlǐyǎ said: "Naturally, it will be popularized among the public. Inventors have always popularized their inventions among the public; no one has ever said that they would keep it for themselves. This is the principle of evolution. You must know that many scientific inventors in the world often think hard and invent something, but they themselves do not enjoy the benefits of it at all, but instead enable future generations to enjoy endless benefits. There are many such cases. Although some countries often grant inventors a few years of patent, that is only meant as an encouragement and does not mean that circulation is not allowed. Our kind of car is of course prepared to be popularized among the public, but how do you think we should popularize it?" Jin Dànyún said: "In addition to manufacturing that kind of car for people within the automobile manufacturing company, we also set up a leasing company. That leasing company specializes in leasing that kind of car, either for family travel, for engineers, or for research in various fields of study. For example, if they need that kind of car but cannot afford to buy it themselves, or if they only need it temporarily and do not need it permanently, they can come to us to rent it. The rental period can be monthly or weekly. We can even provide drivers. Wouldn't that be very convenient for people?" Mrs. Sūlǐyǎ was moved by what she heard and wanted to try it out. She discussed with Jin Dànyún how much capital would be needed to start such a company. Jin Dànyún said: "This depends on how many vehicles the company has and the size of the area. For the sake of trying it out, let's tentatively set it at three million yuan in national currency. What do you think?" It is precisely</p>
<p>The lake and mountains should not be encircled by dreams, and activists often stop in the suburbs. (96)</p>
