<p>白崇禧將軍談</p>
<h3>中國縱不能多獲外援　亦能進行抗戰　美應禁止以軍用原料代給日本日如在華得勢各國卽喪失利益希望法人對華南交通不加妨礙</h3>
<p>南嶽　據白崇禧將軍昨日對美聯社記者言、美國保護遠東權益唯一之方法、即在禁止軍用原料之供給日本、『美國人民不能僅僅注意於目前、而必須着目於遠大之將來、不能僅僅空談九國公約中之門戶開放政策、必須進一步中止軍用原料之售與日本、」美國苟能推行此一致政策、則不僅能大助於中國、且足以保持美人在遠東之權益、「當然、中國即使不能多獲外援、亦能進行抗戰、但欲使日本不危及美人之權益、則難能矣、此一問題、英法亦所同感、因英法在日人手中、亦受盡其魚肉也、故美英法三國、在遠東方面實應互相合作、至此自將軍以七次歐戰爲例、稱上次美國之參戰、由於</p>
<p>主持正義　因此戰事於以縮短、此爲美國目光遠大之行動、「目前美國之羅斯福總統與威爾遜同、亦已出而主持正義矣、惟具有遠大眼光之美人、雖不在少數、但少數孤立派往往目光如豆、不能認識世界之眞相、思以軍火商之利益、高置於高尙原則之上、因此一至禁止以軍火售與侵略國之法案行將通過時、彼輩即百計予以阻撓、此種態度、實將貿易所賴以安全之原則、供其犧牲、其爲短見、又何待言、設在遠東方面、因各國此種態度而喪失安全、則日人在華得勢之後、各國之利益焉有不隨而喪失哉、」白將軍對於安南法當局限制中國輸入品（如汽油與鋼鐵之類）之行動、</p>
<p>極爲不滿　「老實說、我人對於法人在歐戰爆發煎後所實施之此種限制、極爲不滿、我人曾向法方抗議、有時法方亦稍稍放鬆此項限制、但至目前、安南法當局又行推行限制矣、目前之限制、用意何在、實屬不可思議、至少法人此種行動、實有類於幫助日本、據白將軍言、法人此項行動、由於畏懼日本、「但須知日本所欲者非獨爲中國之權益、同時更爲法英美在遠東方面之權益、假使中國不能自衛其權益、則當然更無法維護第三國家在遠東之權益矣、反之、假若中國能對日本維持其權益、則第三國家之權益、亦可安然無恙、因我人之權益與第三國家之權益、頗多和諧一致之處也、今歐戰業已爆發、我人不再盼望法國對華更有何種幫助、惟我人所期望者、即法方對於華南之交通綫、能</p>
<p>予以開放　不如妨礙耳」、白將軍對於歐戰、不願表示熊度、但謂「我人站在我人之友國方面」、記者叩以英法獲勝之後、對於日本將否施行壓力、白將軍答稱、「余若在同一之環境中、亦必如是也」、據白將軍言、此次湘北日軍失敗之後、非二個月之時間不能恢復、故新攻勢當在兩個月後、華方之戰略目前尙未改變、惟華方已準備作大規模之反攻、不過此項反攻、須視下列三項要素爲轉移、　中國軍隊之訓練與武裝配備、　日本軍隊之士氣與東京之政治變華、　國際形勢之變化、（二十五日美聯社特派員馬丁）</p>
<p>朱家驊對路透社記者談</p>
<h3>日軍在湘北進攻失敗　散佈種種讕言　圖掩軍事失敗眞相以遂其離間的陰謀</h3>
<p>重慶　中央黨部秘書長朱家驊、二十四書長朱家驊、二十四日晚接見透社記者、對詢最近外傳種種讕言答稱、余曾對紐約泰晤士報記者答稱、敵國派遺西尾壽造來華、不過爲强弩之末、圖冉一逞」、果爾、敵軍在湘大舉進攻、向我長沙直趨、不意遭我軍迎頭痛擊、頓告挫敗、遂展其故技造作種種讕言、冀掩蓋彼軍事失敗之眞相、以遂其離間陰謀、此種讕言本不值識者一笑、原不足辯、茲姑舉例而言、如敵人的傳播「英國正勸告中、與日本言和、」「及蘇聯向國民政府提脅迫條件」云云、非特無絲毫根、且爲極無常識之可鄙宣傳、夫中國自抗戰以來、即本其旣定國策、劍及及、悉力以赴、無論內政外交、或軍事、或建設、雖經緯萬端而其歸趨則、此歸趨爲何、即針對日本侵略、以打破其征服迷夢、回復我領土主權之整、及保全我獨立自由是也、以言和平、其在敵國、固因陷入不拔之泥淖而妄自希冀「速和速決」、其在中國、則除非日本軍閥澈底悔悟、掃數自撤退在我國境內之軍隊、則斷無考慮之餘地、如此堅定立塲、旣非任何環境所能改變、亦非任何意向所可左右、我中央固已屢次宣告於世界、何况中國目前英勇奮鬥所負之使命、並在爲維護人類正義而戰、凡具有優越文化及正義感之國家、其對我之同情與協助、當然繼續無問、垂諸久遠、至於蘇聯與我之相互合作、尤始終不渝、蘇聯駐華大使潘友新、遞國書時、於頌詞中、已將此旨闡明無遺、從何而來所謂「脅迫條件」、蓋觀點旣屬一致、利害亦復相同、在勢在理、有固然也、綜觀中英中蘇邦交、敦陸異常、吾人惟見彼此間友誼關係與日俱增、鐵一般事實、橫在眼前、無待　言、故此後倘再有類似謠言發生、其爲敵人日暮窮途之無聊表現、而純屬子虛無疑、朱氏於此更提及二十一日上海大美晚報英文版所登、日本向中國提出停戰條件三條之重慶消息、謂大美晚報此項消息、不知其從何處得來、該報登載如此毫無常識之謠言、實足使該報之信用與價值一落千丈、末後記者復詢朱氏對歐局之觀感、朱氏　歐戰發生、誠屬人類之大不幸、但望能覔致合理之解決途徑、俾歐洲重獲光明、（二十五日電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>中國對外貿易與日本</h3>
<p>中國政府對於戰時國外貿易的統制，開始於去年三月；惟當時對於進出口商品的限制，並不怎樣嚴格，致去年入超一萬二千萬元，今年上半年更增至三萬二千萬元。政府為平衡國際收支起見，乃於今年六月起強化國外貿易的統制，禁絕非必需品和奢侈品的進口；以各種獎勵的方法，增加出口商品的數量；實行以來，頗著成效。八月份已有進口減少，出口增加的趨勢。九月情形更為好轉：據海關發表數字，洋貨進口值九千三百萬元，較八月的减少三千五百萬；出口值八千五百萬元，較八月的減少一萬五千萬；入超降至八百萬元。這是今年前九個月中一個最小的數額。</p>
<p>九月入超八百萬元，這在今年一月以前，並不是一個怎樣足以驚人的數字：過去不僅是比這個數字更少的月份很多，並且在前年的十月到十二月，去年的六月到九月，都還是出超。不過我們要知道前二年的情形，和最近完全不同：第一，在一年之前，從甯波沿海而南，到廣州灣為止，中國還有好幾個吞吐海口，一面控制，一面利用。最近的情形，幾乎沒有吞吐的海口了。第二，從前中國貿易出超的時候，中國政府所能控制的國外貿易的數額比較巨大，同時淪陷區域的對外貿易，日方因忙於軍事行動，還未注意及之。最近的情形恰和從前相反：戰區的擴大，使政府所能統制的貿易數額减少；而日本又竭力從事於淪陷區域貿易的控制。依據平時的經濟地理來估計戰區的貿易，則在全國貿易額中。戰區實佔百分之八十以上：所以到了戰時，因人口與資本，以及生產工具的移動，消耗品類的變化，這種百分比當然不準確了；然這次辦到入超减少，實在是難能可貴。此中的原因，一半固是政府的統制有方、一半則是大部分的人民能切實遵守國家的法令，以表示他們愛護國家的忠誠。至謂歐戰的影響，雖有相當的關係，但這是對於進出口兩方面的。</p>
<p>中國的對外貿易，正如整個的中　一樣，前途實具有無限的光明，她直接控制下的國外貿易，早已成為一種有利的趨勢：從今年一月到八月，戰區以外的國外貿易差額，已變為入超四千三百萬元；而西南各關，却還是出超的居多，最近政府更能以各種方法減少淪陷區以內的入超，這是中國貿易政策的成功，也就是日本在經濟鬥爭上相形見絀的確證。而且照未來的趨勢看來，將更會使中國國外貿易，獲得很順利的發展：因為日本在淪陷區域的經濟活動，一方面是企圖擴大他自己的經濟勢力，同時也在排斥第三者的權益，以謀獨佔一切；他不僅是排斥歐美各國對華的貿易，甚至還禁止歐美各國的對華貿易。譬如長江的長期封鎖，便是顯例。不過日本這種壟斷行動，最近也已為歐美有關係的國家所深惡痛絕了：她們原來對日讓步的，現在都希望變為報復。上海英商會最近出版的公報，公然指斥日本的所謂「遠束新秩序」實即「遠東無秩序」，因而表示他們需要一點「新空氣」，這是代表淪陷區域內英國商人的一般意見。美國的上海僑商，在不久之前也曾電致美國政府，要求中立法修正案避免對中國的運用不利；日咋華盛頓電訊，美參院會口頭表決允許美國船隻航行太平洋，這也是無疑的表示美國決不放棄對華貿易的機會。我們更以參證美國政府，最近對於遠東問題一再表示強硬的態度，允顯見她有護持其在華權益的決心，這豈不是足以打破日本壟斷中國戰區對外貿易的企圖；而大有助於中國戰時對外貿易的自然發展嗎？</p>
<p>不過也許有人以為縱使英美等國能夠掃除對華貿易的障礙，而能自由經營，但因中國缺乏所能控制的沿海重要港口，結果仍恐不免問接有利於日本在淪陷區所把持的經濟資源。其實這也不免是一種過慮：我們要曉得在現時日本封鈹政策之下，歐美各國的進口貨物全然是被阻遏的；而出口運往歐美各國的，也還經由日方壟斷之，才能出口。將米祇要達到打破日方的壟斷政策，便得暴露日本在淪陷區域經濟活動的失敗，同時也就不啻是中國對外貿易的新生機！其間微妙的關鍵，在於日本不能放棄侵略，即不能樹文中日兩族的正常關係，也就不能發展正常的工商百業。同時，還可以斷言日本若不放棄侵略，則決不會實行其開放門戶，尊重各國權益的諾言。</p>
<h3>德外長在但澤演說　決接受英國挑戰　謂英應負戰爭戎首責任　安全未獲保障不願言和</h3>
<p>但澤　德外長里賓特羅甫昨夜在此對衆演說、由德國各無錢電台傳播、並譯成各國文字轉播國外、演詞要點為（一）痛詆英國、指英國強以戰爭加諸德國、（二）德蘇間固有的友好關係之恢復、（三）德國對美洲未有任何野心、（四）但澤永不再與德國分離、</p>
<p>里賓特羅甫之結語曰、「非俟有對於德國人民而施的此種攻擊擊永不復作之担保後、吾人決不媾和、吾人深信我方理直、吾人在最後一分鐘、尚竭力冀挽回強加諸吾人之戰爭、吾人抱此信念、定以吾人全部精力奮鬥到底、非德國大獲勝利不止、吾國決以其全力與對於吾人中最偉大的人物卽吾人元首之信任、與敵方相周旋」云、（二十五日路透電）</p>
<p>德外長里賓特羅甫</p>
<p>但澤　德國外長里賓特洛甫昨晚在但澤市發表演說、檢討波蘭戰事及英法對德宜戰之經過、里氏宜稱、渠相信舉世皆知法人不欲作戰、而英國政府自慕尼黑會議後、即有系統的計劃對德決戰、故藉口波蘭事件向德挑　、德國於希特勒和平提議被拒絕後、决定接受此項挑戰、而德國人民應決心在國家安全未　保證以前、决不中途放下武器、</p>
<p>里氏略述但澤歷史、及六年來之德波關係、宜稱、恰好一年以前、余奉希特勒元首命令、向波蘭駐德大使李潑斯基提議將但澤市在政治上與德國合併、在經濟上與波蘭保持聯繫、同時提議修築鐵路公路、雙方承認疆界及延長一九三四年互不侵犯公的二十五年等項、其時希特勒元首亦親向波外長柏克上校重申此意、本年三月二十一日、余又第三次向李潑斯基提出商討、亟言德波關係必須廓淸、並邀請波外長柏克來德進行談判、詎料李氏於同月二十五日提出等於完全拒絕　氏提案之備忘錄、聲稱「如冉以德國計劃相迫、不啻欲對波作戰」、同時波蘭增加日耳曼人之迫殺、增強德波邊界之部隊、德國容忍半年、直至波軍犯境後、自不能不以武力答覆、今”德國已親見該區域利益範圍之劃分、及眞正和平之實現、德俄兩國將永為東歐寗靜秩序興和平之保障也、</p>
<h3>和平努力勞而無功</h3>
<p>里氏至此、暢論德國外交政策、宣稱、自一九三三年一月三十日以來、德國外交政策之目的、為摧毀凡爾賽條的並消除該的所造成之一切結果、會迭以不流一滴血之方法、獲得若干成功、此在英國則每次橫加阻撓，而德國方面仍盡各種努力、企圖與英法獲得合理的協定、一九三三年夏季、德方提議德法兩國總揆希特勒達拉第之會晤、計劃已瀕决定、旋經達氏打消、豈非歷史上之憾事、德國自希氏秉政以來、其外交政策之基礎、為促進英德之關係、希氏屢次演說及余迭赴倫敦、均專為獲致英德諒解、此非徒託空言、而係具體建議、余以希特勒元首名義、向英國首外兩相及其他政治家所提議、計包括下列四點、</p>
<p>（一）英德海軍諒解、根據三十五比一百之基礎、（二）永遠保障荷蘭·比利時。法國之完整、（三）德國尊重全世界之英國利益、而英國尊重東歐之德國利益、（四）英德締結防衛同盟、規定德國願以其艦隊及若干陸軍、供英國指揮、以作保護英帝國之用、</p>
<p>其結果英國政治家及輿論之答覆、均昭吿德人、謂英國不需德國邦交、</p>
<h3>蘇德利益不相衝突</h3>
<p>關於德蘇關係、里氏宣稱、兩國生存攸關利益互相毘連、並不相犯、經濟需要互相補償、領土糾紛永遠不致發生、兩國人民對於互不侵犯公的及邊疆友好協定、均極表熱烈擁護德蘇兩國關係巳到達最後而淸晰之基礎、此項邦交惟有日趨深厚、</p>
<h3>德對美洲絕無野心</h3>
<p>至於德美關係、德國隨時尊重美洲門羅主義、德國除商務關係外、在美洲大陸絕無利益、英國方面屢次宣傳德美不睦之消息時、德國均盼望美國人士能以常識窺破其伎倆、而明瞭德美之間惟有親善、方使雙方有利、</p>
<h3>戰爭罪魁孰應負責</h3>
<p>里氏至此、論及此次「戰爭之罪魁」問題、宣稱、法國之不欲作戰、乃舉世所知。毫無疑義、法國願意談和、但彼強迫作戰耳、事實上英國政府秘密作有組織之備戰已非一日、自慕尼黑會議以後、英相張伯倫立即宣佈龐大之軍備計畫、因此證明張氏之赴慕尼黑、非欲阻止戰爭而欲延緩戰爭、所以在德國歸併蘇台德區之時、英政府未用武力、蓋以軍備尚不充分、實不能、非不為也、波蘭事起、英政府之保證專係對付德國、不勸波蘭考慮和平提議、一味慫恿作戰、至九月二日義相墨索里尼提出最後調停時、尚可臨崖勒馬、但張伯倫仍悍然拒絕、</p>
<h3>需殖民地德無他求</h3>
<p>英方宣傳德國有獨覊世界這野心、事實上德國絕無殖民地、顧英國所轄自治領·殖民地·保護地。代管地。達六百十一處之多、此種誣陷、固可無待剖白不攻自破德國之外交目的、希氏已一再申明、不外三點、</p>
<p>（一）使日耳、曼人安居其自然頒土、（二）保證德國人民適當之生　程度、（三）使德國人民有發展文化之可能、</p>
<p>今德國團結工作已經結束、凡爾賽條的已經取消、德國東南西北四面疆界巳經最後决定、德國除收回舊有殖民地外、對英法均別無所求、但央政府和信今日為英德作戰之時機、此種政策乃將英帝國命運作孤注一擲、在歷史上恐為英帝國之自掘墳墓、如謂德國之自食諾言、則英國之違背慕尼黑協定、寗非食言、張伯倫所謂和平、乃回到凡爾賽條的、中止國社主義、易言之、即欲使德國民族停止生存、歐洲局勢陷於混亂、但此決做不到、德國今已决定接受張伯倫之挑戰、在德國安全未獲得保證以前、决不放下武器、使德國民族永不再受此種攻擊之威脅云、（二十五日海通電）</p>
<h3>英法報紙　評論一斑　未見有何新颕點　認為係對內而發</h3>
<p>倫敦　德外長里賓特洛浦昨所發表之演說、此間官方人士頃加以評論、咸謂此乃對內而發、即在從長研討之前、亦知其毫無新頴之點、更無特殊重要性質、但德國希圖離間英法兩國、父可於此獲一明證、里賓特洛浦且欲在德國人民之前、竭力掩　眞相、對於張伯倫首相在去年九月間成立慕尼黑協定時所推行之政策、不惜予以曲解、此種謊語、雖三尺童子亦難予以置信云（二十五日哈瓦期）</p>

<p>巴黎　德外長里賓特洛浦昨在但澤市所發表之演說、此間各報加以評論者為數甚少、且謂此項演說、並無新頴之處、其作用端在對內而非對外、「右派秩序報」載稱、「凡鄙夫所能言者、茲已盡附言之、國社黨各領袖所發表之言論、寡廉鮮恥、正與彼等之行為相同、里賓特洛沛此項演說、主要目標所在、乃欲將該國元首希特勒自所造成之窘境、向德國人民加以掩飾、「右派日報」戰稱、「此項演說並未以新的因素、加諸現行國際局勢、如此平凡之言、竟與希特勒磋商至兩小時之久、始乃發表、實屬不值」云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　美國務院已訓令駐德大使館要求德方對所傳美輪弗林忒城號被德艦攫捕事作充分之解釋、預料美國將要求蘇聯政府釋放該輸、蓋聞弗林特城號駛抵摩曼斯克後、蘇聯政府已根據除在特殊情勢下、德國無權押輪入中立港之理由、而將該船扣留也、國務卿赫爾招待新聞記者時、討論弗林特城號被捕事、謂該輪所載之貨、半數以上或係有條件的禁品、小部份則為絕對禁品云、赫爾不願言明美政府將取何種舉動、惟稱此次意外事件、顯向捕擄手續方面進行、果爾此乃始終出以武力之事、據此間接訊、該輪之美國船員與旗幟已代以德國船員與旗幟云、羅斯福總統招待新聞記者時亦述及此事、稱美政府刻仍圖向蘇聯探詢該輪被捕事之詳情、但尚未接獲船昌今在何處之情報云、羅總統繼答記者之問話謂、就捕船而論、政府所有船隻確與私人船隻身份相同、莫斯科美大使館已有報吿抵此、據謂一切事實尚未確悉云、記者又問羅總統按照現行法律、有無論令美船不入戰區之權、羅總統答曰「吾」、並稱渠希望取回弗林特城號輸、（二十五日路透電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　蘇聯扣留美船弗林特城號之法律上根據、現已引起極活動之討論、預料此事可使蘇聯表示其一般態度、美海軍部法律家阿克斯台爾稱、蘇聯如不公然立於德國方面則必交還此船云、潑林斯頓大學法學教授柯爾溫稱、如蘇聯保持中立、則美國可提抗議、而更要求釋放、但若蘇聯表示其為交戰國之一、則凡將違禁品運入蘇聯之各船、皆將受協的國方面之拘捕、凡在此種環境中被捕之中立船隻、惟遇氣候惡劣或船身受損或缺少食物時始可能入中立國口岸（廿五日路電）</p>
<p>紐約　關於美國貨船「弗林特城一號在蘇聯摩曼斯克港被扣留事、此間各晨報咸皆表示不滿、但其論調尚屬溫和、紐約泰晤士報載稱、「各中立國輪船若果載有違禁品、交戰國海軍原有加以檢查之權、美國政府並無何項異議、但德國軍艦若不查明他國輪船所載係屬何物、即勒令駛往中立國港口、加以扣留、則美國政府當以非法行動目之、國務院並巳電令駐德蘇兩國大使、要求駐在國政府加以說明、一俟各該大使呈覆之後、則蘇聯對於德國立塲如何、可立見分曉矣、」民聲講壇報則就法理觀點討論此項問題、略謂、此案解決方式可在技術七引起重大困難、「此案含有炸藥、必須以鎭靜態度從事檢討」、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>戰時歐洲進行曲　（續）　倫敦特約通信</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>是的，剛剛上樓來的，是這裹的房東老太婆。她的來意，是讓我到下面地底一層去避空襲。可是，我不下去。</p>
<p>「放心吧，我不相信希特拉的飛機，能夠衝到倫敦上空來的」——這是我的理由。</p>
<p>她安心地笑起來了。可是，在仔細地檢視了我的防毒面具一遍以後，又固執地放在我的肘邊，可嚀了一句：「好吧，聽你的便。不過，當你聽到高射砲的第一響時，請下來吧。」於是，又轉身下樓去了。……可嘆息的老人啊！這兩天來，為着她那唯一兒子的是吾被召入伍，在擔着深深的憂慮。……</p>
<p>這一年多以來，為了掩護他們自己的特有外交路綫，英國張伯倫一流人物，發明了一個口頭上的三段論法：「如果英國強硬反對侵略，那末，希特拉就難以再行擴張。——不能擴張時，德國一定會挑起大戰，而英國也一定會捲了進去。——可是，英國準備是沒有完成的，所以當前任務，就是準備；而外交上，就祗好對德繼續讓步」。</p>
<p>「準備」！「準備」！第三個還是「準備」！——這口號，掩蓋了一切的醜惡。</p>
<p>一年多以來，大家聽得耳朶都幾乎起了繭；但，就在上個禮拜，我們還聽到一位英國張伯倫派的要人，在說着道樣的話。可是一禮拜後的今天，英國却和德國宣了戰。到底英國的準備情形如何呢？大家都在這樣關心着。</p>
<p>純軍事戰鬥的方面，在這裹，且不說。我們略略看一看其他方面的，英國準備情形吧。</p>
<p>不是說着，德國的空軍，轟炸後方最可怕麼？而且，不是又在說着，英國空中防禦的不充分麼？除了高射砲外，據說，也缺少防空的氣封。</p>
<p>可是，現在僅僅就倫敦一市而論，這樣的氣球，就有着一萬八千多具！兩年多以前，我在國內，會上過南北兩戰塲，也會停住過天天被空襲的南京，却一决也沒有見到這種氣球；但中國也一樣地和敵人作了戰鬥。現在在這裹，於這剛剛宣戰的第一天，就在倫敦瞻仰到一萬八千座這樣的怪物。——這是一種每個有一座樓那麼大銀灰色的怪物，升在空中，飄呀飄的，叢密的地方，驀的看去，却像一池浮滿着的荷葉。</p>
<p>是的，還有最可怕的，是敵人的毒瓦斯。於是英國當局，就普遍地，對每個住在這三島上的人，每人發了一個防毒面具。現在，全英國住着的國民和外僑共有四千五百萬；然而，英國所預備的防毒面具，却有五千一百萬個！除了每個人都巳領到一個外，還剩下六百萬個，堆在儲藏的地方，當為了後備隊。而號稱空軍最發達的德國，她的國民，也都沒有這每人免費領得一個防毒面具的幸運。德國的防毒面具，主要的，是為的向外出口，換取外匯和原料。不久前，聽到這裹有人在販賣着德國造的防毒面具，每個價兩鎊十二先令六便士。但她的品質，並不比英國這免費分發的好，所以結果是，自然無人過問。</p>
<p>為了，戰時服務，英國全國已經登記了的擔架隊，救火隊，救謎車隊，……等等，除去原有的，在職的不計外，僅僅臨時召集起來志願人員，男女合計起來，已經超過二百萬以上！不久的將來，還另有補充的三十五萬名。</p>
<p>還有，食糧也是一個大問題。可是，在歐洲大陸各國多半宣佈食糧節制制度的今天，英國還沒有採取節制。據一般估計，過去兩三年以來，英國的內政部，就已經不斷地儲積食品。縱使這時起，英國一點食品也不進口，儘所有的，至少還可以支持二三年。何况在海上，有着牠無敵艦隊保護下的大隊商船。所以，這裏有一個非常奇怪的現象：兩個多月前，歐洲局面緊張時，你可以看見成羣結隊婦女們，在採辦着食品，準備儲蓄；可是現在戰爭眞的爆發了，而儲蓄食品的現象，却絕了跡。</p>
<p>英國交通運輸的組織和能力，也是可幣的。僅僅以倫敦來說，三天前，英政府開始了倫敦住民的撤退。在這三天之內，經過政府搬出倫敦的，就有一百五十萬人！再加自動的搬出的計算，那人數，至少在三百萬以上。可是，令我們注目的，却是交通綫上的絲毫沒有擁擠和紊亂。（九月三日夜三時半）</p>
<p>（九月四日早晨附註：現在知道了，原來昨天夜裹空襲警報，是為了演習，並非眞有敵人飛機來臨。官方發表了道一决的測騐結果，是「頗為滿意」云云。（完）</p>

<h3>難童救濟教養的　癥結和改進辦法（三）</h3>
<p>— 錢用和</p>
<p>（二）教養方面</p>
<p>（一）給養費用　救濟難童、最大需要的是生活給養費、最低標準、每童每天須一角的伙食費、從戰區救出來就得供給三萬難童、一天的伙食費、須三千元、一個月計共九萬元、到了保育院·或教養院·慈幼院、四季衣·袴·鞋·襪·被·帳·蓆·墊·全備齊、每童須三十元、三萬人計九十萬元、醫藥和院內各項設備、教職員薪金、尚不在內、平均每童入院時、一切用品、須佔四十元、每月經常教養費、須佔十元、以三萬計、一年來用去四百八十萬元、此後戰區擴大、各難童救濟團體、收容難童更多、費用當更浩繁、這項大宗給養費、須政府盡量補助、國內外社會熱心人士的慷慨捐予、才可維持、但事實上生活程度較高的城市、每童每天一角的伙食是不夠的、起初收容的難童、疾病特別多、醫藥費每童每月平均須佔五角、因為經濟的困難、有的保育院或教養院、慈幼院、只好把每天三餐伙食、减為二餐、或竟一粥一飯、使十餘歲正在成長發育的兒童、吃得半飢半飽、營養缺乏、多而黃肌瘦、又以教職員的待遇菲薄、院中不得不供飲食、結果教職員工友的伙食、還吃在每童每月三元的伙食費內、不滿一百兒童的院、一個兒童的伙食、一個月祇吃到二元代價的飯菜、膳食管理得法、尚可勉強維持、雖是豐年米賤、但柴炭煤油的價格、飛漲數倍在城市中的生活更是提高、轉瞬冬令將屆、大批寒衣棉被、都須添置、一個兒童的衣被、以二十元計、三萬兒童、就得六十萬元、最近各地因轟炸搶救的難童、人數激增、尚未算在內、所以難童的給養費用、政府和社會還得多方　措、</p>
<p>（二）疾病治療　難童從戰區裹逃出來、經過許多艱苦的生活、餐風沐雨、在污濁的環境中度日、所以多數害病、癩痢頭·疥瘡·沙眼、這些普遍的病症、差不多十之八九、是患着的、胃病·肺病·梅毒·也不在少數、難童送入保育院、或教養院。慈幼院、第一件事就是洗澡·換衣·剃頭刮沙眼·檢查身體等、有的病由醫師指示方法、僅看護照料、教職員協助、可以治好、有的病、非送入醫院不可、所以醫藥費在難童救濟中、也佔重要部分、最困難的、病童太多、醫師護士及藥品太少、在內地各院、這個問題、更是嚴重、有時連紗布棉花也缺乏、夏天沒有帳子難童受蚊子黑蟲的咬嚙、入秋瘧疾流行、毒瘡遍體、竟有全院兒童、個個患病的、死亡當然不免、醫治也費時日、難童既離父母、又罹疾病、精神的痛苦、可以想見、入院以前的病、是不得已的、入院以後的病、管理不良、是一部分的原因、例如兒童飯食、營養不足、往往每餐兒童有吃七八碗飯、致胃中容量擴大、减少伸縮性、胃病發生、床舖被褥不足、二童合蓋一被、患疥瘡兒童、與沙眼兒童、或癩痢頭兒童同睡、結果一童染患二種或三種病、再加病童衣服不分淸楚、不加消毒洗臉沐浴、病童大多不能絕對隔別、輾轉傳染、成為普遍現象、以救濟難童的仁心、釀貽害難童的事實、也時有所聞、有的院舍、借用廟宇祠堂、既少窗戶、又很潮濕、難童多臥地舖、入夏濕氣大發、爛腳濕症不易醫治、冬令因缺乏寒衣棉被、凍瘃也成流行的病症、一年四季、難童輪值的害病、或竟各病都患到、所以難童疾病治療、是一個最嚴重的問題、</p>

<p>美國奧林匹克委員云、近擬將明年之奧林匹克大會移至美國舉行、但芬蘭對於此種步驟提出抗議、彼堅持因所耗投資過鉅、無論歐洲方面情形如何、奧林匹克大會必須在芬蘭舉行云此事如果實現、中國是吾派遣選手殊堪注意、大的須俟王正廷博士由渝抵港後、方有具體決定云、</p>

<h3>金融　買風轉盛　外滙反動回緊　沙遜繼續吸收　港方結進遠期</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、俱無上落、英美匯喑市、趨勢終因前日鬆勢過甚、反動回軟、而在五辦士大關內外作一度盤旋、木在意料之內、蓋上兩日絕未聞有大戶出籠、且現時供給者多數扳價、故籌碼巳並不充裕矣、昨日因週三祇半天、市况初開即緊〇三一二五及〇六二五、英金為四辦士九三七五、美匯為八元二五、嗣以沙遜繼續力扒、且聞洋行及華商亦有吃進、而港電則購遠期、一時買風擴大、又軟至先令四辦士八七五、美匯八元一二五、但此後買賣忽轉和緩、一度略吿堅定、惟終以有利及日行入市搜羅、因而價格再緊、英金為叫辦士七八一二五、美滙亦破入八元大關、軟達七元九三七五、至收盤結果、英金為最緊價四辦士七八一二五、較上日緊一八七五、美滙為八元、較上日軟三一二五、而英較美允緊、乃因美英互滙連漲二日故也、聞期貨交易會有做開、惰况與現貨相同、半天交易尚旺、</p>
<p>美滙曾進八元關</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近期長　五、遠期升三七五、紐約銀價漲三七五、倫敦生金呆定、滙兌英對美對法均平、對滬縮一二五、美對英昂六二五、對滬漲叫角、對法大二五、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四辦士九三七五、美匯八元二五、較之前收、英緊〇三一二五、美軟〇六二五、開後因沙遜復來扒結、兼港電忽收買期貨美滙、並聞華商與洋行界亦跟踪扒結、致市勢續趨歟化、計沙遜扒進荷蘭麥加利現貨英金四辦士九〇六二五與八七五、繼而洋行界結進外行現貨美滙八元一八七五與一二五、時港電購進某行十一月份美滙八元、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉大一分半、此後扒風稍戢、一度轉平、聞外行會互做過現貨英金四辦士九〇六二五、同時現貨美滙亦回硬至八元一八七五、旋以英行有利突代某方吸納、加之日行亦接踪搜買、故為狀復趨緊軟、計有利與日行扒進外行現貨英金四辦士八四三七五及七八一二五、並現貨美匯由八元一二五、緊至七元九三七五、午刻狀態略定、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士七八一二五、美滙八元、本月份與現貨相同、十一月份英金四辦士七三四三七五、美匯七元九〇六二五、結果英較美為緊、現期英均緊一八七五、美俱軟三一二五、午後週三無市、</p>
<p>香港英滙無變動</p>

<h3>金市上漲</h3>
<p>港帮吃胃不旺</p>
<p>昨日現余烚赤暗盤市况、經六天猛落、突然回高、惟人心尚少刺激、全盤局勢隨匯市鬆軟為轉移、晨開為三千八百二十元、巳較隔昨狂漲五十五元、原因外匯回緊、售者暫作覜望、惟繼聞匯市轉定、錢兌業及金號均出而買進不力、曾兩度降達三千七百六十元、但終因匯市緊俏、金號反出為進、證券帮亦來搜購、價即漲至三千八百五十五元、中途雖金號復出而略回、及至午收曾為三千八百三十五元、午後開價與上收相埒、後因扒者無上午之湧、且港帮吃胃亦少、會退至三千八百元、然結果收盤復高至三千八百二十二元、較上日回漲五十七元、交易仍旺、的二千餘兩、銀樓飾金亦回起五元、海關金等仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤回五十七元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開因外匯緊軟、激動買風、證券帮首先抬價而賣方乘機扳價、開市竟橫跳五十五元、證券帮進錢兌業三十兩、為三千八百二十元、開後銀樓帮與錢兌業忽來猛塞、目外匯為狀轉定、進者不力、立退入三千八百元關內、錢兌業互做二十兩、為三千七百六十元、嗣因某令號拉提、一霎那抬起四十元、錢兌業進金號二十兩、為三千八百元、此後另一金號代大戶出籠、遂再退達三千七百六十元、旋以某金號續代投機商收買、兼證券帮復來搜購、加之外匯步軟、致飛漲九十五元、某金號進錢兌業三十兩、價為三千八百五十五元、將近午刻、某金號忽獲利復出、目錢兌業等亦跟踪吐售、不久遂回落三十元、錢兌業售予金號五十兩、價為三千八百二十五元、後某銀樓進錢兌業二十兩、為三千八百三十五元作午收價、午後初開尚定、首由某銀樓進錢兌業五十兩、價仍為三千八百三十五元、此後雖某銀樓續代港帮羅購、但究屬為數有限、且某金號及散戶等賣氣頗濃、竟反　小三十五元、金號互做三十兩、價為三千八百元、入後某錢兌業趁低吸收、且港帮復稍來活動、遂拉高二十五元、錢兌業買予令號二十兩、為三千八百二十兀元、繼而錢兌業互做三十兩、為三千八百二十二元、作晚收價、結果比上日回漲五十七五、全天九十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價照烚赤較高十元、收進須减小二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>首飾金掛高五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出初時大同行仍懸三百八十元、迨至十一時十五分掛高五元、此後未見更動、計大同行改懸三百八十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進均須减小十五元至二十元不等、</p>
<h3>外幣轉堅</h3>
<p>英美金鎊升一元</p>
<p>昨日外幣市况、英美金鎊、供給轉稀、市况堅挺、英美金票客戶吸納殷切、上升頗多、香港票因港匯趨堅、跟隨昂貴、法郎票安南票、需要見增、價亦上升、斐律濱票澳金票亦隨英美金票上升、日金票市况微堅、晚市為一元三角二分五厘、朝鮮票需要微增、市况稍堅、晚市為一元零九分五厘、昨日市價、英美金鎊、俱升一元、英金票升一元二角、美金票升四角、香港票升六分、法郎票升一分、荷蘭票升二角、安南票斐律濱票、俱升一角、羅比票升五分、澳金票升五角、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>證券　市况呆滯</h3>
<p>昨日證券暗盤趨勢又轉鬆軟、表面上跌去五六角、其實與隔日收盤後之做價相彷彿、無甚軒輊、可謂大漲小回、　面人心仍屬堅穩、並無特殊形態、在丙種跌至八元半時、買戶即極為踴躍、逢低買進之心理、中人巳深、造成易漲難跌之局面、外滙稍緊、金子又回高、多方進取之心稍懈、消息沉悶、謠言暫息、各帮動態亦漸見沉靜、惟時局變化在最近將來咸謂將有顯著之進展、故注意於公債市塲者、集會人日見衆多、前途將有較大之變化也、昨日情形、上午先疲後堅、各帮進出頻繁、生大鴻康等買進、以二十號乘低吸收為最湧、同康天生及四十號均有賣出以昌記了多為最多、午收　小五六角、午後形勢安定、各帮生意亦少、雖昌記仍在繼續賣出、而市價頗為堅穩、市價結果、回小三角半至六角半、獨九六好一角半、成交總數的一百萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日</p>
<p>統甲五八·七〇五八·六〇　五八·六〇跌〇·六〇</p>

<p>股票交易、成交華成烟草公司股五十股、價為二十九元五角云、</p>
<p>衆業公所昨日股市略感呆滯、殆因交易祇半日、故價格大致與前彷彿、</p>
<p>倫敦二十四日電、今日中國外債掛牌行市仍吿平靜、上下檔各種公債均無榮辱、倫敦二十四日電、今日英商遠東各公司股票掛牌行市又見上漲、麥加利銀行股升二先令六便士、為七鎊七先令六便士、滙豐銀行英倫註冊股升一鎊半、為七十五鎊牛、又香港註冊股升一鎊、為七十六鎊、古拉客林傍橡皮股升三便士、為十六先令三便士、其餘平平、</p>
<h3>紗花　紗價又昂　雙為雙地球　各跳卅元外</h3>
<p>逐日猛降之紗市、昨則反動　起、且漲勢旣狂暴而又劇烈、此種反動回升、亦在情理之中也、同時外匯改縮、港帮因價廉納胃稍健、微露生氣、一般搶帽子者在市爭先恐後的撈進、於是　面一緊，買氣極盛、市盤乃步步上騰、查市塲成交、同業含輸贏性質、時進時出之交易占百分之七十以上、前途茶礎、是吾能鞏固、非待實銷來培養抉植不可也、吾則終難在動盪不定、風雨飄搖之中、因存底巳見增高、專恃囤戶及投機者之拉提、實非根本問題、</p>
<p>現紗晨初開盤、承上日之餘風結挺、開價尚平、旋聞外匯突縮、人氣立刻鬨起、投機者又復起來、買風頓熾、呌喊聲大振、市價步步上升、二十支雙馬現貨價由六百二十六元做起一直做至六百五十六元收盤、其他牌漲力較為和緩一步、查半日間成交統計二千〇三十包、行情一十支雙馬漲三十四元、天女漲三十四元、雙地球漲三十六元、廠方由永安廠開出二十支特金城四百包、價為六百五十元至六十元、查棉紗今（廿六日）有四件、運往香港、又有三百五十件、運往寗波、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>

<p>紗業公會自下月起即十一月一日起、搬移在大馬路跑馬廳新世界東部二層樓照常營業集會、原來之處所因租的期滿矣、</p>
<h3>火機花　跌至百廿元</h3>
<p>本棉同業成交、轉趨熱鬧、但廠方因紗價飄盪不定、採辦心思尚在觀望中、所有交易、都係花號買賣也、棉價火機花跌落一二元不等、至於通州花品質優勝之貨、售價尚平、惟絲毛較遜之貨、依然鬆動、查到頭由蘇北來通花九百七十五包、常陰沙一千三百四十八包、又由北沙來四百五十四包、茲將現棉售開之盤列左、（鈔票棧交）</p>
<p>火機花　一二〇·〇〇　同業　二〇〇包</p>
<p>又　一二一·〇〇　又　一五〇包</p>
<p>巴西花　一八三·〇〇　又　六〇件</p>

<p>火機花　一二一·〇〇　二三·〇〇　又　一、〇〇〇包</p>
<p>通州上午一三〇·〇〇　又　一二〇包</p>
<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來因匯兌猛鬆之故、紗價慘落、同業俱抱觀望、廠方停辦巳久、同業藏有手貨者、因受匯兌影響、俱蒙受損失、昨日滙兌雖已轉緊、然棉價終未能高昂、故各方心思異常淡薄、業棉者以棉價之漲跌、全賴棉紗、然業紗者則謂須視棉價之漲落而定之、然究其實、物價之漲落、全在滙兌之高下也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市晨初即形堅定、因投機者之購買、及現貨交易之鼎盛、市况殊為挺秀、利物浦來電良好、因之同業交易頗為衆多、結果收盤價格、較之上日漲四五磅音、印度平平、埃及漲十餘磅音、利物浦漲四磅音、</p>
<h3>糧食　米來源較暢</h3>
<p>昨日各帮來源、河下又無到頭、車輪包子到四千餘包、到貨既夥、更以隔昨市面已見回軟、故早市開手、人心虛浮、客家售心均鬆、及後本鄉兩胃亦復平淡、乃形勢益懈、市面遂難立足、結果、成交數全市不過五六千包、而若新粳及窰種百哥等價悉較前市貶落半元至近元、其餘破粳變元與乎蘆羊尖客尖降半元上下、計常錫高新粳收盤行情為三十一元、一二十元〇五角、其次者至二十六七兀、市破粳三十元至二十八九元、决二十六七元、蘇同崑常新粳二十九元半、二十九元、次至二十六元、破　二十五六元、靑角窰種三十元〇五角、野稻三十一元、三十元〇五角、楓嘉百哥二十九元、次至二十七元半、松江次百哥二十六元半、薄破二十六元、南港白稻二十九元、早破二十五元二三角、特羊尖二十三元半、决至二十元〇八角、特蘆尖二十四元、决至二十二元半、江北尖以邇來與產地市價難以劃通、及撇運等阻碍問題、久已無到、市上所在授受者、僅　昔有限之存底而已、故雖際蕪尖貶落之間、而一般貨主未肯輕脫、堅持極力、同時銷塲方面亦都歡迎暢辦、是以收盤因稍受蕪尖影饗、略眨二三角、做開十九元七角十九元半、其南京一號則開十九元八角、二號十九元三角、在號十八元八角、蕪湖杜尖十九元八角、决至　尖十八元、陳變元三十元、二十九元、新元二十六元半至二十五元、</p>
<p>客秈昨市到多銷細、行情續見回落、來貨除江北到數不多外、京蕪一帶續有整批抵埠、據傳蕪湖產價步小、常地機米巳小至十一元許、今後來源似不致見少、東行雖乏整批吐出、而零星小數、續有出售、且本市存米日多、人心趨軟、市價並削三五角、統市交易亦不足三千包云、</p>
<h3>砲車粉　客盤開七元半</h3>
<p>麫粉　日昨現粉堅穩如常、南北洋帮客銷堪稱聯蟬、津帮及港厦等處、均有零星添取、惟為數不旺、蓋目下廠方亦不願儘量供給也、二號粉本街批價仍為七元三角、客盤如兵船天竹等粉均須七元四角、而砲車牌聞巳開過七元五角者、市面腳地尚穩、統市成交四萬包、</p>
<p>小麥　日昨來源不多、銷路亦不旺、因前日外匯放長、金市猛跌、洋麥定貨或有接近之可能、所以廠方趁此擇巧而取、貨方以成本高昂、尚不肯過於遷就、結果市面續昂一二角、統市由福新廠進江北及蘇州麥八百包、價為十元零六角至四角半、國戶購常州及崑山麥十四車、價為十元零八角三分至六角、</p>
<h3>油餅　生豆油　到貨相接　行情挫落</h3>
<p>咋生豆油行情、一致轉跌、主因來源聯接、各帮辦胃不貪、故人心大定、市氣懈淡、花生油挫跌一元半、豆油跌去半元至一元、共計做開膠州生油二百件、價為五十八元、江北聽裝生油七百五十聽、價為七十三元、都為港方採去、本街祇成交大連豆油二十五桶、價為六十八元、烟岐豆油五十件、五十元零五角、靑岐豆油一百件、五十元、江北聽裝豆汕一百聽、六十四元五角云、</p>
<p>豆子今日運往香港二百三十包、運新嘉坡三百包、又豆餅三千二百塊運新嘉坡、</p>
<h3>絲茶　白廠經驟跌四百元</h3>
<p>昨國外絲市、日美絲價均呈漲足而跌、紐約近期跌一角零五厘、遠期漲一分、橫濱現貨跌十元、遠期跌三十五元、洋行進胃因之停頓、白廠七八分吃價為四千三百元、較上週之四千七百元、巳跌四百元之巨、但目下上海存絲枯薄、大部原料尚被扣於虹口、故廠商手貨有限、均不願遷就、咋白廠輯里均鮮交易、印莊亦無進出、</p>
<p>茶葉今（二十六日）有十件、運往香港、</p>
<h3>疋頭　交易復起</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>棉布邇來跌勢太猛、同業及散額囤貨、已先後脫手、市盤較之本月初十磅粗布每疋已小四元、細斜細布亦須三四元、昨紗市回振、人心看漲、本街落手採辦、成交突旺、售盤晨市尚多參差、午後一致加起粗布細布斜紋漲每疋一角至二角半、色布色斜漂布漲每疋二角半至五角、本街補空及心思生意、成交粗布細布細斜五百餘件、粵帮辦粗布絨布府綢三千餘疋、蘇北興化等地辦色布直貢嗶嘰一千數百疋、閩帮辦色斜色布嗶嘰二千餘疋、國外暹雜小呂宋辦色布印花布二千數百疋、甬帮購存各貨裝出頗湧、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>昨以紗價回升、白貨色貨一致轉好、晨午兩市直綫上騰、十二磅龍頭細布由每疋十八元四角步漲至十九元二角半、四君子元嗶嘰每碼六角零二　半升至六角三分、本街新國戶及同業補空非常踴躍、細布細斜成交達千餘左右、行家本月份龍頭細布做開十九元五角、市氣殊挺、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>今日有一千三百匹十件、運往寗波、又二十七件運查港、二十八件運新加披、二件運庇能、</p>
<h3>糖市　洋糖產價雖平　滬市行盤仍好　潮糖有加稅說</h3>
<p>昨糖市據荷蘭電、即裝粗白稍平、為荷盾一一·二五、但外匯見縮、故公會劃盤、因亦回好、現貨二四粗白升二三元、本棧五十五兀、外棧為五十五元至五十五元半、轉口貨四十二元半至三元、升元半、太古車白升二元、B嘜五十八元半、CW嘜五十八元、CX嘜五十七元半、DY嘜五十六元半、HX嘜五十六元、H嘜車赤四十二元、荷赤四十三元、均升二元、本綿白升二元半、振記一號五十五元半、二三叫號照退、本一號冰升一元、為六十七元、晶明冰六十八元半、國產潮糖、據市傳說有加稅之事、但未能證實、然實銷依然甚呆、開出至缺、</p>
<h3>市况彙誌</h3>
<p>陳糯米枝見升　糯米枝新貨乏到、惟查陳貨會到七十餘箱、昨聞業巳開出、貨較前為佳、故加起二三十元之多、行方購淮後、加以揀剔、或將售二百卅元</p>
<p>小馬口鐵銷淸　九十磅小馬口鐵、市面已久寂、客帮去路停頓、本街銷胃亦僅小五金廠家零星買戶、故市况平靜、標準開價刻市如美貨每箱沽一百十元、英意貨售一百〇五元、一百磅美貨開一百二十元、英意貨則喊一百十五元、</p>

<h3>推薦補品  趙君豪</h3>
<p>數年前，本人因用腦過度，時感精神不足，戚友紛以酌進補品相勸，又苦不知何種補品最爲適宜，旋聞西友某君述及牛肉汁之功效，不覺歆然心動，但以一般外國製造之牛肉汁售價過昂，久服殊非經濟之道，因又改服元下公司之新鮮牛肉汁，深覺味既鮮美有加，而補力亦絕對不在舶來品之下，時或兼進童雞汁，更得奇效，連服一二月後無論體力方面或智力方面，均有顯著之進步，目服食便利，價亦公允，堪爲近代補品之最上上乘，爰就本書篇末，特以短文張之！（錄自趙君所著中國之報業）</p>
<h3>終年無病的小孩子  秦瘦鷗</h3>
<p>鄰居鄒先生是我的老同學，又兼老同事，彼此在福煦路做鄰居，至少也有四五個年頭了，所以他自己和他家裏的事，我一古腦兒全知道得很清楚，即使要像我『冷子與演說甯國府』那樣的逐件記載出來，也不成問題，可是一來未必有什麽興趣，二來離開本文的範圍也似乎太遠了。</p>
<p>如今單說他一家大小共有五位，他賢夫婦之外，其餘三個都是他們的公子，鄒先生年紀不滿四十，一口氣就養了三個男孩子，確也一般『艱於子嗣』此人的眼中看來，委實是再福氣不過了，可是他老人家在三年以前，確也曾爲這三個孩子受過一番苦咧！因爲他自己是個文彬彬的勞心者，而他夫人也僅有『骨感』並無『肉感』，兩夫婦的身體一樣都很瘦弱，因此養的兒子也個個都是『皮包骨』，動不動傷風咳嗽，請醫吃藥，甚至常患大病鬧得家翻宅亂，雞犬不甯，兩夫婦往往一星期不開笑口，說來說去，無非爲了三個孩子的病。</p>
<p>他也未嘗不注意到『未雨綢繆』這一句名言，心裏極想給他兒子們吃些滋補的東西，使身體強壯，從而戰退些病魔，最初他聽了幾位吃過多年花旗麵包和沙濾水完全把中國人當做外國人的西醫先生的話，打發三個孩子常吃牛奶和魚肝油，不料抱歉得很，牛奶太膩太油，魚肝油太腥氣，吃了兩三個月，孩子的身體沒有好，胃口反先倒了，鄒先生一急，忙找中醫，改吃銀耳燕窩之類，吃了半年多，算算化的錢已經不少了，而功效却一些也不見，問問老先生們，都說這是『王道』補品，有遠功而無近效，再問遠功究竟幾幾時可見呢，老先生們却又說不出，後來差一些鄒先生就要弄人參給孩子們吃了，但想想終究不好，仿佛活了三十多年，耳朵裏似乎不曾聽見七八歲四五歲的孩子吃人參，於是只得皺着眉頭，整天整夜的發悶。</p>
<p>可巧有個冬天我正在訂服元下公司的童雞汁，他便和我閒談，打算也去訂三份來試試，我因爲知道他經濟也並不如何富裕，便勸他先訂三份牛肉汁，給孩子們試服一個月再說，不料二十多天以後，三個本來臉色黃得像枯蠟一樣孩子，居然也透出一些紅意來了，老二原是每晚要在床上小便的，竟也從此停止，鄒先生一快活，便讓他一小兄弟三個吃了一冬的新鮮牛肉汁，到第二年鄒夫人的精神也愉快了許多，據她自己說，三個孩子平均每三個月只生一次小病，再不像先前那樣的弱不禁風了，於是年年訂服，除掉夏天的三四個月之外，幾乎從不間斷，直到現在，這三個小鄒先生已成終年無病的孩子了。</p>
<p>我寫這一篇東西倒並非純爲元下公司宣傳，主要的目的還在告訴大家：補品的選擇，真也不是容易的事！</p>
<h3>等於一件「狐嵌袍子」  呆</h3>
<p>表兄祝蓮君，身體孱弱，畏冷，嚴寒時非重裘不暖，不但行動累墮，工作亦不便利，逃難途中以一夾衣蔽體而已，抵滬後，租屋置物，耗費不贅，雖仍重裘而力不勝矣，祝夫人深知元下牛肉汁可以滋補元氣，強健筋骨，乃購之以調湯中，祝君僅覺其味鮮美而不知有異也，嚴寒已故，新春將至，某夜祝君謂夫人曰：余昔日非重裘不暖，今夜穿棉袍亦不畏冷，抑滬上天氣較暖故耶，祝夫人嗤然而笑，祝君知有異，詰之始得實，乃嘆曰：余今知元下公司牛肉汁之實效，不但爲滋補良品，且等於一襲狐嵌袍子也，於是每日牛肉汁來，祝君必曰『狐嵌袍子來矣！』</p>

<p>唐家有位小兄弟·小小十七歲年級·</p>
<p>去年身體不大好·面黃肌瘦無力氣·</p>
<p>吃飯只吃半湯盞·讀書用功沒興味·</p>
<p>郎中說他童子癆·爺娘急得無主意·</p>
<p>幸虧隔壁三好婆·說道要吃童子雞·</p>
<p>天天常吃太麻煩·殺雞煮雞多事體·</p>
<p>採用元下童雞汁·功效更大價便宜·</p>
<p>於是買來天天吃·毛病頓時就脫離·</p>
<p>身體強壯面容好·跑路好跑六七里·</p>
<h3>「兩脚氷氷冷」  陳靈犀</h3>
<p>元下公司是專製牛融資童雞汁的唯一大公司，牌子老，規模大，名氣響，我是早已聞知。有許多朋友。因我是個勞心的人。血虧體虛。勸我購服牛肉汁。或是童子雞，連得幾位醫生朋友。也都在推薦着，認爲這是冬令補品中最有實效而又經濟的東西，每月化上十頭八塊錢。，譬如喝瓶汽水，功效足抵過參茸呢。但我却始終沒有嘗試過。因爲有人曾告訴我，牛肉汁之類，是由外洋購來的原料化成的，那原料好似泊油一般，是一大桶一大桶買來，而裝成一小瓶賣出，所以我便也有些不信任，不願試服了。</p>
<p>如今吃了元下公司陳承沅君送我的元下雞雜雞脚，却給了我一個強有力的證明，證明元下公司的出品真嶄實貨的用新鮮的雞牛，用科學方法，提煉成汁，因此我便從那時起，接連吃了三個月童雞汁。</p>
<p>功效怎樣，也應該附帶報告幾句，我是個體弱多病的人，無庸諱言，到了冬天，內人老是說我身體不好，該吃些補品，爲什麽要到冬天才知我身體不好呢？說來也就夠肉麻有趣了。原來當我上床。把一雙脚伸進被窩裏的時候，總不免碰在她的身上，我的脚是和在冷水裏撈起來的一般，這便是氣血兩虧的緣故，有時她是勸我吃補品。有時却罵我是和死人脚一般的冰冷。可是自從服了元下童雞汁後。却漸漸成爲熱脚了。這還不是元下童雞汁偉大功效的確證嗎？</p>
<p>今年爲了免挨內子死脚之罵，我是開始又在吃童雞汁了。去年時由雞雜雞脚而吃到雞汁。却又不免想起去年的雞雜雞脚。所以要拖上這帶不光明的尾巴。正是文章作法中之呼應法。並不是要討雞雜雞脚吃。如果這篇文章給陳承沅兄萬一見到了。一個粗心，沒有看出我的古文筆法的文章。　　我是在向他討雞雜雞脚吃。那　　爲情死了。</p>
<h3>自服四載　效力偉大  江寶箴醫師</h3>
<p>元下公司出品之牛肉汁及童雞汁，確具偉大之效力。鄙人自服牛肉汁以來，業已四載，精神方面，較之未服之前，更覺飽滿，對於親友及病家有需服牛肉汁及童雞汁者，經介紹服後，亦同聲贊美，而其服法簡便，滋味適口，猶其餘事也。</p>

<p>老夫今年七十。內人四十五歲。去年冬天，忽生一子。取名元官。不意視族中人，對于此兒。頗多疑問。謂六十以上之人，斷無生子之理。故擬將元官出族。按老夫與內人，年雖老邁，然在六年前，即每日服用元下公司新鮮牛肉汁，從未間斷，所以身體皆異常強壯，況內人因服牛肉汁而月經從未停過，當然可以生男育女，毫無疑問也。特此鄭重聲明。</p>
<p>（二）招親告示</p>
<p>照得鄙人幼時先天不足，三歲一場大病，七歲又出天花，幾乎送掉性命，也算區區造化，幸虧調養得法，吃得混身胖肉，新鮮童子雞汁，發行就是元下，天天吃此補品，身體補得不錯，眉清目秀文雅，身段舉動不俗，現在徵求嬌妻，敬告大家閨閣：如願與我結合，包你一生幸福，不論燕瘦環胖，我都有意合作，倘能情投意洽，一定大家快樂！</p>

<h3>傷寒症飲食宜忌程序表  陳孝仁</h3>
<p>病後營養以牛肉汁童雞汁爲最宜</p>
<p>·濕溫·秋溫·春溫·冬溫發熱在二週以上者·此表均適用·</p>
<h3>發熱時期之飲料</h3>
<p>（一）發熱清淡。其人不欲飲食者。可聽其不進飲食。如欲飲食者。可吃『飯滯湯』。即俗名鍋巴湯。飯焦湯。飯皮粥者是也。有熱時只吃此湯。不可漏入飯米屑粒。鍋巴以焦枯滯黑者爲最佳。取其扶助胃氣。易於消化之意。飯滯湯中。究有營養力量。此物係流動液體。既能養身。而不致滯於腸胃。傷寒症唯一養身之至寶也。</p>
<p>（二）濕溫傷寒。可兼吃米仁茶。（即苡米煎湯。只飲其湯）焦大麥茶。暑溫傷寒。可兼飲荷葉茶·藿香茶·菊花茶·佛手茶。尚須因症而施。先徵求醫生同意。</p>
<p>（三）白開水爲傷寒發熱時最佳之飲料。常飲頗有益於發熱時至消耗。近時病人頗多詢問能否飲橘子水者。此物雖可飲。但須榨汁熱飲。橘子須肥大甘美者。小者帶酸亦不宜飲。</p>
<p>（四）發熱爲日既久。如其熱度漸低精神倦憊。渴思飲食者。可酌薄藕粉湯。（要真藕粉。始可應用。如用白色藕粉。多係澱粉菱粉山芋粉之類。不宜也。）麥片湯（即美國麥糊片先炒焦。再煮成薄湯）食時以『飢』字爲原則。不可求飽。</p>
<p>（五）傷寒第二時期中熱勢狂盛。經醫生之囑。可飲雪水煮茶。西瓜露。竹瀝油之類。口苦膩淡無味時。可咀嚼青鹽陳皮。鹹橄欖。黃連頭之類。一日換一種。嚼汁吐渣。是爲至要。</p>
<p>（六）傷寒發熱期內。飲牛乳須經醫生同意。</p>
<h3>寒熱退後第一日至第四日</h3>
<p>傷寒寒熱。如其退盡。即腸中炎性已退。消化機能。漸見活動。此時即需食料。以供消耗。與寒熱未退時之情形。顯有不同。寒熱初退之第一日至第四日。飲食必須遵守下列程序。</p>
<p>食料約爲五種：（一）飯滯粥（二）藕粉（三）麥片湯（四）米麵捲麵（五）粵人可吃桂花粉湯。</p>
<p>飲料約有六種：（一）大麥茶（二）米仁茶（三）桑芽茶（四）紅茶·綠茶·白開水（五）豆腐漿（六）牛奶。</p>
<p>佐食小菜約爲六種：（一）甜醬瓜（吐渣）（二）雲南大頭菜（吐渣）（三）腐乳（四）海蜇（五）芝麻醬（六）青鹽拌豆腐。</p>
<p>水菓方面約爲五種：（一）橘子（二）新會橙（三）茡薺（四）橄欖（五）生梨。</p>
<p>菜肴方面寒熱初退四日內。佐食菜肴。堪以入選者。極爲稀少。蓋寒熱初退時。身體需要食物。以供補充消耗。且以久餓之後。令人貪食異常。久臥之軀。一旦病魔初釋。惟以飲食爲唯一消耗慰藉。故咸如渴驥求食。食慾奇盛。此時有一危機。即因傷寒愈後。常委消導未復常度。不勝滯積。胃強腸弱。因是最易復病。故病後仍須戒食。上列飲料。每日可各取一種替換。以易口味。此外物品。不宜嘗試。油膩葷腥生冷野味均忌</p>
<h3>熱退第五日</h3>
<p>食料方面。可增多四種：（一）麵包片。（二）焦米粥。（三）冬霜米粥。（四）稀薄米粥。</p>
<p>飲料方面。可增多二種。（一）新鮮牛肉汁。（二）新鮮童雞汁。</p>
<p>菜肴方面。可配食：（一）素菜湯（二）菠菜蛋白湯。紹興乾菜湯（三）番茄湯（四）蛋花湯（五）鴨湯（六）雞血湯（七）菠菜豬肝湯（八）雞湯（九）絲瓜湯。輪流更換。</p>
<h3>熱退第十日</h3>
<p>寒熱退後十日起。可食較厚米粥。尚有可食而不忌之物品：（一）冬瓜（二）麵筋（三）山藥（四）烤排（五）火腿（六）肉鬆（七）白菜干（八）乾菜精（九）筍衣（十）香菌（十一）豆腐皮（十二）豆腐衣（十三）通心粉（十四）扁尖（十五）綠豆芽（十六）皮蛋（十七）鹹蛋白（十八）蘿蔔及各種醬菜。以上所舉名目甚多。可供病者更換選用。但終屬不宜多食。次數不妨稍多。量數不可過多。初時尚須吐渣。稍久可細嚼食之。</p>
<h3>吃飯問題</h3>
<p>傷寒寒熱退後十五日起。可食軟飯。（如陳米。冬霜米。香粳米之類。）待二十日至一個月後。恢復常態。所舉日期。須視病之輕重而有伸縮。因粥飯一類。關係重大。必須按此次序。早食米飯。最易復病。此時忌食：（一）糕（二）硬餅（三）粽子（四）糯米圓子（五）悶豆（六）栗子。</p>
<h3>病後攝養期</h3>
<p>病後總以富於營養易於消化之流汁爲最宜。故傷寒病後。雞汁。牛肉汁。雖屬葷品。實爲不可缺少之養身妙品也。</p>
<p>有若干病家。以爲病後不宜遽食葷性發食。雞汁牛肉汁誤爲發物。初時頗不敢食。其實此種觀念。實屬大悞。蓋傷寒非外科病。病後忌口。並不忌葷。更不忌雞。此時需要流汁補品。牛肉汁雞汁。爲唯一適宜之品。此外確無更好更有效力之食品。患病一個月者。需飲牛汁雞汁二個月。患病一月半者。須飲汁三個月。恢復元氣。充實體力。增進氣血。皆屬顯而易見者。</p>
<p>病後忌口。不以葷素爲別。易消化而有補力者。雖葷不忌。雖消化而無補力者。雖素亦不可食。且病後胃口薄弱。一時不可即服補藥。因補藥呆胃。服藥過多。流弊滋生。補身反足害身。雞汁牛肉汁。補而不膩。味極鮮腴。不但爲病人所喜。尤無補藥之流弊。病後虛疲益甚者。『　滋藥方』務須隔一個月。或待至是年臥冬兩季。始可進服。</p>
<h3>解決滬西糾紛　工部局草擬節略　作爲基本方案從事談判　英軍在滬西仍加緊防務</h3>
<p>工部局情報室昨晚發表公報云、『工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥、暨該局警務處長鮑恩少校、正在商討建議綱領若干項、將於一二日內、向「特別市政府市長」傅筱庵提出、俾作爲一種基本方案、以解決工部局與市府間之爭執』、證之上述公報、關於越界築路糾紛、自經二十三日晚由領袖領事意國駐滬總領事納羅尼中校、邀同雙方、並由日領參加其間斡旋後、僵局業已打開、此後所可注意者、爲工部局對此國際未經承認之「特別市政府」、將依據何種基本方案、以解決爭執也、茲記昨日發展情形於後、</p>
<p>雙方商定基本原則</p>
<p>二十三日工部局總董樊克令與僞「市長」傅筱庵晤談、係於下午五時在「市中心區」僞市府舉行、外傳係在傅私宅不確、出席者有領袖領事意總領事納羅尼中校、及日總領事三浦義秋、根據僞「市府」方面對越界築路之要求、樊氏曾提基本原則三項、其中一項、對於越界築路之管理權、擬由局方與僞「市府」合組一「聯合管理局」（似與上海市長俞鴻鈞與費信惇所談定之原則相同）、以行使之、俾解決爭端、與會各方、對此建議、雖未完全贊同、已頗加注意、</p>
<p>起草方案進行談判</p>
<p>雙方基本原則、大致已定、已陷僵局之談判、又有重開之望、昨日工部局總辦兼總裁費利溥會同工部局總巡鮑恩、已根據樊克令傅筱庵談話結果、開始起草解決方案、據聞將於今明數日內草成、送達傅筱庵、作爲工部局與僞「市府」兩方面討論之依據、</p>
<p>設管理局作爲過渡</p>
<p>據外人方面可靠消息、工部局提議設「聯合管理局」以解決越界築路之一切糾紛、殊有實現之可能、惟此項聯合機關、僅爲過渡時期之產物、俾能迅速結束前此一切不安狀態、迨至「聯合管理局」成立後、一面即進行第二步工作、由工部局與僞「市府」劃分越界築路之管理權、即將某一部越界築路之一切管理權、悉讓與僞「市府」、所餘各路之權益、則由工部局保持之、當工部局放棄一部份越界築路時、同時工部局、將向僞「市府」取償若干費用、即工部局過去對於越界築路之購地、造路、護路、溝管、工程等項所耗之費用、以及公用事業公司在該地帶所投之資、悉將向僞「市府」取償、此在僞「市府」方面、則當越界築路交涉開始之際、傅筱庵即已表示、工部局及公用事業公司在該區之耗費、可得取償、故一般相信、雙方之主要觀點、已趨相同、而最近晤談之結果、據稱良好、故信長久之糾紛、殆將於短期內獲得解決、</p>
<p>局方商討建議綱領</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今（二十五日）晨聞諸極可靠方面、工部局總董樊克令、星期一日夜、由義總領尼隆與日總領三浦、伴赴傅筱庵寓所、舉行會談後、工部局總裁費利溥與警務處總巡鮑恩、刻正繕擬若干概略之建議、將於一二日內提交傅筱庵作爲解決雙方爭執之基礎、至是、爭執已久之上海界外馬路問題、乃向諒解與正常狀態方面、邁進一大步、聞費利溥與鮑恩刻正繕擬之計劃詳則、尚未完畢、惟眾信建議之要旨、當謀儘可能對上海「特別市府」此前所提關於界外馬路問題之建議、表示諒解、</p>
<p>馬路轄權勢須劃分</p>
<p>記者於已往一週內、曾向工部局與「市府」官員作私人之探詢、其中數人、以爲整個事件、可得雙方滿意之解決、又聞工部局與「市府」當局從事磋商時、曾提出由工部局與「市府」警察局聯合管理界外馬路區之建議、但據各官員表示見解、對於雙方聯合管理之可能性、雖予嘉許、但預料未必有此可能性、又有數官員則堅信聯合管理界外馬路（連收稅等在內）大約爲期當頗短促、一般人感覺、在此種初步妥洽後、當將擬定馬路轄權之劃分、說者謂此其意義爲數道馬路將由「特別市府」完全控制、其他馬路、則由工部局管理、</p>
<p>僞府償付市政費用</p>
<p>眾信在此種或相類之條件上妥洽後、工部局對於移交「特別市府」管理之界外馬路、將開「費用書」提交「市府」、此項「費用」中、或將包括「交還」各馬路之建築費用、「市府」對於此等「費用」中耗於洩水與購地之資、一級公共便利各公司在該區所耗經費、當予償付、查傅筱庵於談判之初、即提議工部局與公共便利公司在界外馬路區之一切耗費、當予償還、「市府」方面、既抱此態度、消息靈通方面今晨乃稱、不久雙方開始直接談判、可望獲得有希望之結果、與充分諒解、而完全解決久懸的爭執之一切困難、</p>
<p>英軍出防以備萬一</p>
<p>越界築路區域億定盤路愚園路及憶定盤路大西路兩處交又中心、均裝置紅綠交通燈、向由工部局巡捕管理之、僞警曾多方奪取、迄未實現、自二十日下午憶定盤路愚園路之崗捕遭暴徒襲擊後、捕房方面、爲增強防務起見、連日加派中西探捕、分別在兩處駐守、同時英防軍亦出動佈防、並在兩處各建沙堡一座、日前英防軍除在憶定盤路愚園路東南轉角處加築一小型沙堡外、昨日下午一時、復將憶定盤路大西路西南轉角之沙堡拆除、移築於西北轉角之人行道上、沙堡內外均釘有木板、頂上則蓋木棚、一切工程、較原建者爲堅強、查該兩處英防軍、除一部份派在轉角處佈崗外、另一部份則駐留借用之民房內、隨時可出動、嗣後該兩處之防務、當可無虞、至曹家渡一帶日來情形尚稱平靜、秩序已恢復事變前狀態矣、</p>
<p>日發言人代僞張目</p>
<p>日本大使館發言人、昨晚在新聞報導席上稱、「滬西越界築路問題之主要觀點、業經工部局與「特別市府」同意、故最後之友誼解決、已可期望、當雙方二十三日會晤時、工部局承認「特別市府」所宣稱之對於越界築路的主權、主權一點、既無爭議、則可信工部局方面即將以越界築路之徵稅權及管理權自動交與「特別市府」、現在主要觀點、既已相同、所續待討論者、厥爲工部局對於越界築路投資之收回問題、以及該區治安與秩序之如何妥善維持問題而已」、記者詢以僞「市府」現在該區徵收何種捐稅、發言人當即否認僞「市府」現在該區徵捐、並謂「各項捐稅、現均由工部局徵收、惟並非謂工部局有合法之權、可以徵收該區之捐稅、不過工部局在該區設施種種公用事業、故應得代價也、至工部局在該區之投資、「特別市府」亦已予以承認、故此點雙方亦毫無爭議」、記者詢以外傳工部局與僞「市府」將合組「聯合管理局」以治理越界築路之說、發言人答、「余未有所聞、當工部局總董樊克令去訪「市長」傅筱庵時、據悉、曾攜有方案三件、但並未以任何一方案向「市長」提出、故現時對於此點、無可奉答」、</p>

<h3>滬杭客車　又中地雷炸燬　在長安硤石之間中地雷傾覆　日死傷十餘人乘客亦多傷亡</h3>
<p>華東社云、據滬杭路來客談、滬杭綫長安至硤石間、日前目被遊擊隊轟燬日僞軍官乘坐花車數輛、並擊斃軍官兵士數十人後、迄今未及半月、詎前日（二十四日）晨、硤石至長安間、又繼續發生車輛中雷被炸事件、且此次被炸形勢、較上次更爲猛烈、緣二十三日</p>
<p>由滬開杭</p>
<p>之末班車、向例開至嘉興宿夜、翌晨（即二十四日）再由嘉興開杭、不料該班列車駛過硤石將近長安站五六公里許地方、又中地雷、當場炸燬車輛十二輛、機車全燬、並聞此次被炸範圍、較上次爲廣、所有燬損路軌約長一公里許、又客車內附掛有貨車數輛、內滿載豬玀、亦</p>
<p>全遭炸斃</p>
<p>、又開車之日人機匠、與日軍死傷達十餘人之多、乘客死傷亦在數十人以上、昨據由杭來滬之商人談、余（商人自稱）適於前晨（二十四）由杭乘早班車來滬、詎車駛至許村、已不能前進、據站中人稱、長安至硤石間、車輛又告</p>
<p>中雷炸燬</p>
<p>、恐有遊擊隊襲擊、當由駐站日軍、先在車上布防、緩緩前進、駛至長安站、日軍先行下車、在被炸處、放開步哨、實施警戒後、各旅客始負囊提箱、紛紛下車、步行約二里許、復再乘坐預先停靠該處軌上之客車、再行駛滬、向例出杭開滬早班客車、平日中午十二時</p>
<p>即可抵滬</p>
<p>、因是此班客車遲至下午七時許始到達北站、據稱、該次被燬車輛、幾無完膚、血肉模糊、慘不忍睹、路軌燬損甚長、一時恐難修理完竣、而行旅至感痛苦、亦殊冒險極矣、</p>

<p>斃日軍五名俘二名　漕涇僞軍屢圖反正</p>
<p>茲據滬西來人談、滬西程家橋地方、原駐有忠義救國軍姚友蓮部隊、越昨（廿一日）下午一時發生激烈之游擊戰、查該處隊伍由王隊長統率、實力雄厚、向稱姚部精銳、是日上午王隊長據密報、得悉日軍將至、立即下令整備、至下午一時許、日軍一隊已抵程家橋、並攜有</p>

<h3>對外貿易好轉　入超激減</h3>
<p>入超減少二千餘萬　爲今年最小之數字</p>
<p>九月份全國對外貿易、以歐戰爆發關係、洋貨進口空前銳減、土貨出口因美銷轉暢影響尚淺、昨據海關發表貿易數字、全國九月份洋貨進口淨值國幣九千三百七十八萬一千零四十三元、土貨出口淨值國幣八千五百四十二萬四千七百三十八元、入超八百七十五萬六千三百零五元、比較八月份進口減少三千六百六十萬零九千九百七十元、出口減少一千五百四十四萬三千零零三元、入超減少二千零七十六萬六千九百六十七元、至九月份之入超數字、爲今年最小之數目、足證中國貿易已好轉、</p>

<p>捕房警員照常梭巡</p>
<p>據大通社記者昨晨往北江西路至北河南路間視察時情形、頗呈靜止、該區內日軍之巡邏亦顯然减少、而匯司捕房華捕則照常在該區各段內上差梭巡、各種車輛在北江西路以西北河南路以東之警備地段內、仍通行無阻、惟北江西路所佈之鐵絲網缺口處、則僅限自由車及榻車進出、其他車輛、概被禁止往來、</p>
<p>居住區內尙無苛待</p>
<p>該區各段內之戶口編查、迄目前止尙未强迫施行、該區域之情形、與虹口區有別、日方似不致擅施種種苛政也、故照目前住居該區內商店或住戶而言、猶無感覺顯著不便與限制之處、</p>

<h3>美輪先後來滬</h3>
<p>英國商輪不論行駛遠東或默洲綫之船隻、為適應歐戰後之戰時處置、避免遭遇襲擊、無論其為海洋鉅輪或海岸綫之船隻、嗣後航海行程、駛出及到達日期、將均不予宜佈、絕守秘密、該項命令業早抵達此間、故本埠英商輪公司、均將遵照辦理、又悉美國總統輪船公司批亞士總統號、於昨日上午十時半由洛磯山來滬、載來船客一〇一人、美國郵件四十七袋、該輪定今晨七時啟程赴查港小呂宋、該公司之克利扶總統輸、可於二十八日下午由小呂宋香港駛回上海、停泊十二·十三號浮筒、接客小輪、於是日下午二時三十分駛抵新關碼頭、大輸定二十九日上午八時起椗取道神戶橫濱檀香山三藩市返洛山磯、又渣華郵船公司之芝尼加拿輸、則定今午出口、經厦門香港小呂宋返爪哇、</p>

<h3>土貨免結外滙後　滬甬客貨運均滿儎　海逹不准搭客昨未出口　新安納輪今日試航温州</h3>
<p>滬甬錢航運、自財部規定由甬出口土貨、一律須結外匯後、商賈對於採辦成本、須加二倍、致無力採購、因之土貨運滬絕跡、各輪亦受相當影響、故中意公司恩德輸、華輸洋行經理之大埔輪、及太古公司頴州輸等、先後</p>
<p>改航他綫</p>
<p>茲悉土貨結匯出口事、經甬滬兩地商會紛電財部、要求免結外匯、以維商艱、業經財部核准、第一批出口貨土紙一千二百件、巳由華輪洋行經理之海達輸運來、第二批裝謀福輸、亦巳於前日星期二到滬、聞第三批裝永泰馬勒、滿儎的今明可到、嗣後仍可照前辦法、</p>
<p>通行無阻</p>
<p>滬甬綫航運巳見活躍、至運甬貨物、亦不少、海達輸原定前日下午四時開甬、因貨多不及裝儎、改昨午起椗、惟至時仍未能裝畢、復改於昨晚午夜出口、該輪事前會售出客票七百餘張、不意昨日下午四時許、華輪洋行接挪威領事通知、海逹輪不准搭客、多數乘客、業已登輸、公司乃派員至船上、向</p>
<p>乘客說明</p>
<p>並掉換德平輪船票、有不願掉票者、即退還票價、該項手續、至昨晚十時尚未完竣、有少數乘客不肯掉票、又不肯退票、又不允上陸、船員力勸無效、因此該輪不能起椗、據船員云、須俟乘客完全登陸後、始可出口、今晚（即昨晚）已不可能、的改今晨赴甬、謀福輸定今午起程赴甬、聞客貨亦均吿滿儎、本市美商衛利韓公司代理之英輪新安納號、自試航閩省與化返滬後、現為維持</p>
<p>滬温交通</p>
<p>故巳出協餘報關行等承租、定今日試航溫州、裝有客貨甚多、如不獲出口、則改駛鰲江、萬一該處仍不能進口、則再行駛往鎭海口、</p>

<h3>時代的收穫</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>我以為文學工作者的途徑確不是永久有繩墨可循的，他并無一定不移的軌道，勢必隨時代環境的刻刻變遷而俱變。美國的批評家卡弗吞（Calverton）在「文學之社會學批評」中就這麼主張過，即是在中國也有一種「若無新變，不能代雄」，「彌患凡舊」的論調。（見「齊書」文學傳」論）這唯一的原因是文學固然「承先」，但更重要的還有「啟後」；牠一面誠然如勒朋（Gurtave　Le　Bon）所說：「受死者的指導比生者更多，」但與其說現代之受古人影響，還不如說現在的人影響將來，更有意味。</p>
<p>尼采說：「你們不必愛祖先的國，而愛你們了孫的國。」這兩句話很足表明開拓一個時代的重要。赫伯脫（Sydney　Herbert）在「國民性及其問題」一書中更從英國文學史上羅了許多例，說明某一時期文學的復蘇，每足使國民性亦隨之俱有生氣。可見文學的重要性不僅在反映或表現時代，更可寶貴的還須能開拓時代，左右後代子孫國民性的精神。</p>
<p>「滄浪詩話說：大歷以前分明是一副言語。晚唐分明別是一副言語。」說明一個朝代的前後不同，面目尚且差異。可見文學是反映時代的，只要時代有了一番什麼偉大的變革，這含有反映作用的一幅奇妙攝影自然也就來得絢爛動人了。所以我們可以說，時代是植物的根芽枝葉，而文學則是牠的開花結果。反映時代巳無問題，正如開花結果是常然的事。但我們必須注意者：對於收穫採取之前，是吾還須加一點移枝截葉的園藝手術，使更合自己的需要以及怎樣採花，怎樣取果，這些也都考究考究。正如我們適纔所說開拓時代，究竟是該走一條什麼樣的路徑。</p>
<p>依勒朋前人影響後人甚為有力的論調，我們一面自然該讓久被忽略的健全國民性復活，不管是有意或無意，這恰也配合上赫伯脫的論調。最好的例子在中國便是秦漢古文體從初唐四傑手中的解放，和漢儒的實證精神在淸朝的復活。不過應絕對注意的這決不是祖宗遺產一股腦兒接受，挑剔和抉擇還是有賴於時代的指導者的。</p>
<p>根據這一點，時代的收穫便不止當時的環境。過去也是一種來源。然而單恃這一種方法還絕對不夠，一個時代的優勢的概念」也不可以不牢牢把握。泰納說：「無論在何種時期，都不免有一種優勢的概念始終貫澈着。人類當二百年至五百年間，常是理想的人物存在於目前，中古時代是武士和僧侶；我們的古典時代就是朝廷和溫文的辯士。」那麼我們這時代自然也有一個目標的「優勢概念」的。這「優勢的概念」每人心裏存在着深深感到悲憤和壓迫，可以說是很少人例外的，拿來表現這一時代的國民精神，極為相宜。至於古代的「蠻夷猾夏」，史實以及國民性的精神種種，我們自亦不妨用來作文學的復蘇。然而這決不是時代的唯一收穫，當前時代有牠異於前人表徵的特殊表徵，有存在在若干人心中的「優勢的概念」，這我們千萬別將牠忽略。</p>
<h3>白銀在苗區</h3>
<p>— 嚴昌緒</p>
<p>「票子不要！」當我到達黔南想買一毛錢的鷄蛋時，一個老婦人這樣答覆我；這種態度，不能不使我吃　，便反問了一句：「票子不要，什麼才能用啊。為什麼中央票不要呢？」</p>
<p>答語很簡單：一我們耍毫子，因為票子一不留心就會撕破或被火燒去的，並且我們不知道它的眞假。」</p>
<p>「唔！」是為了這一個緣故，我的心不自然地忐忑着。</p>
<p>「毫子！毫子是什麼樣的啊。」我又開始作第二决的請問。</p>
<p>「毫子！呃！是這樣的。」她邊說邊從口袋中找出一個民國九年造的，以前我們在上海和各地通用過的銀角子給我看，神色似乎有些不耐煩的樣子。</p>
<p>「噢！毫子，原來就是這個。」我笑着，却又轉入了痛苦。</p>
<p>為了生意，接着她似乎父轉變了：「先生，沒有毫子也不要緊；不過票子是要打八折的，不然，……」</p>
<p>明知她下面是「不要！」但腹內空空，眞有點恐慌，就打斷了她的話頭，「好好！八折就八折吧！」這樣才算買到了幾個雞蛋。</p>
<p>當坐在矮凳上剝蛋殼時，見到一個漢人，便打了個招呼，談了起來，後來又拉雜地談到這問題；原來他巳住在這裏有！多年了，很明瞭一切：「他們—苗胞—是什麼都不依靠外力的。外鄉人來此，一定要買他們的東西；若沒有毫子，除了和他們交換物件外是沒有辦法的，他們正有着自給自足的本能呢。現在，你看啦；每一個苗胞（少數的窮苦者例外）手中的銀子，你不能佔計出來，同時，他們為了安全，差不多家家都有外人不易發見的地窖，……」</p>
<p>他沈默了起來，接着很深刻似地望望我。</p>
<p>我呆呆地把蛋囫圇着塞進嘴裹，心想：「這不大好，在這裏眞要讓人來多做些政治工作呢，給這些苗胞。」</p>
<p>我瞧着他，他笑了。</p>
<p>我納悶地把蛋嚼着，想把它嚥下，却突的悶住了透不過氣來。</p>
<p>「緊塞下去有什麼道理呢。」</p>
<p>我再睨着他，才理會他在說着藏白銀；我暗笑自己底動作眞太猴急太笨了。</p>
<h3>生的滋養</h3>
<p>— 張根源</p>
<p>每晚，當我走過這塊帶着濃重臭味的，曠塲的時候，我總會那樣被激動的：人們是多末需要着這種生的滋養呵！</p>
<p>我看着那些勞働者們，他們似乎把一天的勞苦和一切的煩惱完全忘記了，他們把自己夾雜在人羣中，笑着，講着；一切都是積極的，有力量的，遠離了他們自已的陰暗的生活；在這兒，他們找到了快樂，不！找到了生的滋養！</p>
<p>在這個空氣異常窒塞並且臭惡的角落裹，—這正是他們唯一可以聚集的一個地方，相近他們居住着的破舊的屋子—這些勞働者們常常在這似乎規定了的時間裏，跑來聚集在一起。那些疲乏而蒼黃的臉開始在月光下發着笑，那些佈滿着血絲的眼睛也在閃着愉快的光輝。聽聽人家所講的一件一件事，也把自己所要講的在大衆面前傾吐了出來。有的是快樂，唱着低級到要使高貴的太太們皺眉頭的小調，或者講稱類乎紳十們口裏的猥褻語；有的是興舊，傳奇地講着長沙戰事的大勝，或者拍着胸膛賭咒地說自己死也不願意做×奸，做亡國奴；有的是　惡，高聲駡某家的老板祇曉得向某種商人曲腰打躬，求他們賞個臉吃飯，却在他們頭上鄙吝地刮着皮，或者咒着撬照會的刁辣；…在這些時候裏，他們是幸福的，雖然那麼臭的氣味時時衝進他們的鼻子，可是他們却習慣地親熱地吸收了進去，而把一腔不平的言語吐了出來，正和坐在堂皇的客室裹的有錢人一樣，他們多來會指手劃腳的說話　。而且絕對有呵欠噴嚏，懶腰等交作的自由行動，誰都干涉不了他們，除了偶然他們的老婆之類有權出來呌他們進去陲覺之外。時或小三子，小六子們討厭地仲出手來想討銅板，準得給他們瞪大眼子嚇斥：「呸！那裏來的銅板，沒有，這樣雖過的日子呢！一出手就是一分錢。」</p>
<p>有一個老頭子不大說話，但他却常給我看見他是他們裹面的一個。他常常坐在一堆垃圾邊，沈思地吸着手中的香烟，從表面上看去好像他不大喜歡和年靑的人多講話，但是他的臉上却時刻流露着回憶的迷戀的微笑。他是個孤老的人呵！年靑的人不大會注意他，（年靑的人以為他是孤老了。）但是他却迫切地需要着這樣生的滋養；雖是他不大說話，然而他會得滿足，他的靑年雖已閃過了他的人生，看着這些，却正是他的安慰呀！……</p>
<p>我站着會呆呆地不動。</p>
<p>這樣被激動地踱回家去。</p>
<p>老頭子的微笑，年靑的勞働者們底愉快，繞住了我的心頭；我感到孤獨，我急切的在冀求着這樣的生的滋養啊！</p>
<h3>記憶</h3>
<p>— 品品</p>
<p>波特莢爾說過這樣一句：「假使我能活一千歲，我的記憶常更多了。」他是多麼看重記憶啊！但我看見我們一位詩人寫出：人假使沒有記憶，人將更快樂。他原來這樣輕視記憶的。</p>
<p>我覺得困惑。人的思想為什麼像山中小路那樣分歧？我想了一回，希望有個解決。喔，我懂了，記憶本是各式各樣的，所以記憶的說法也就分歧百出。</p>
<p>記憶，依極鹵莽的歸納，有兩種：對於自己過去生活的記憶；對於國家已往事蹟的記憶。</p>
<p>倘人的記憶，多少是痛苦的。一個人在窮困的時候才揭開記憶的貯藏箱：情書，愛的贈物，債票，兒時的陀螺，母親的針綫，退下的文稿……一切蒙着灰塵，就是不黯澹的東西也要黯澹了。譬如說，你檢到一片紅的桃葉，或者一紙支票存根，在過去是光耀的，現在你困了，窮了，放在掌上，你會有一陣苦味在喉頭——這些東西雲一樣散了，海一樣不復來歸了。富裕的人不知道記憶，他已有了魚不必再熊掌；窮困的人想在記憶裹淘出一點金沙，可是徒然，反淘出了一掬眼淚。</p>
<p>於是輪到另一種的記憶。且把歷史丟在一邊，太老了，吹不起大浪。你且記記兩年來祖國的奮鬥吧！在飄雪的路角，在秋風的窗前，在烈日的水邊，你得閉着眼想：你的家鄉化為火灰，你的親人流血死去，忠勇的將士在嚴寒酷熱下戰鬥，挂傷，殉難（當他們滅了侵入者，）你的友人在後方效勞……許多許多血的汗的故事，而中心都是一個：中華民國的解放。慚愧，羨慕，憤怒，一齊使心跳。你得讓心跳，心一死，力量也完了。雖然帶點苦味，這苦味是藥的苦味，會醫治你的將逝的力量。</p>
<p>不要氣，只要記，讓舊鬥中的祖國的記憶作我們生命之浪的鼓舞者哪！</p>

<h3>電影常識　卡通片製作的程序</h3>
<p>— 沁田</p>
<p>一萬幅連續畫祇映六分　　十六張畫代米老鼠走一步</p>
<p>目下好萊塢紅極一時的米老鼠卡通片製作者華德狄斯耐（Walt　Disney），最近在好萊塢創設着一家規模很大的公司。這公司唯一的工作，便是攝製卡通影片。</p>
<p>一部很短的畫片，在銀幕上祗映六分鐘，但需要一萬幅連續畫所綴成。每一畫片，所繪的圖晝，略一移動，十六張小畫片，可代表米老鼠走一步，至第一第八或第十六張是繪出老鼠在動作，中間的晝片，不過是形成這種動作而已。</p>
<p>關於繪晝，原初用鉛筆繪在白紙上，後改用鋼筆，再把透明的紙片後面，塗上黑白或灰白的膠質，這樣繪上了綫條，就可顯出圖像。如果是彩色片，那麼大概用彩色來替代灰白色打底的。每一畫片，很留意的記上號碼，這樣才不致錯誤。</p>
<p>一張代表米老鼠的身體，另一張代表米老鼠的手·腳·腿·這樣接連起來，有時身體的一張，可以不必繪過。先由主持的人把草樣打好，指出動作一樣的畫片來代替，這樣在時間方面當然可節省不少。假如米老鼠的手是要緊握起來的，在草樣上早已指出，也許有幾百張是同樣的。</p>
<p>米老鼠畫片如果是一部聲片，畫繒好之後，還須配音。米老鼠的動作，完全要合於音響的節奏，這部工作，也很麻煩，要費去相當心思的。</p>
<h3>談談程硯秋　（上）</h3>
<p>— 郭鐸</p>
<p>談程硯秋的文章，我們已經看得很多了，不過見仁見知，各有認識。我不敢說人家的認識不對，不過我却覺得人家的認識還沒有透澈。因此，我特再來一談。</p>
<p>程硯秋的唱　唱字包括嗓子與唱法兩種。嗓子多半靠天賦，唱法則全憑用功。許多人說程硯秋的嗓子不及梅蘭芳高，因硯秋的西皮戲唱的六半調，二簧戲唱的爬半調，而蘭芳的西皮戲，却唱正宮調，二簧戲唱六半調，這似乎沒有不對。但我們常常聽硯秋唱戲，唱到翻高腔時，祇覺其歌音直干雲霄，繞梁三日而不絕！不要說蘭芳，就是陳德霖尚小雲也不及其響亮，道又是什麼緣故呢？依筆者的拙見，認為這是因硯秋的嗓子寬大的關係。唯其嗓子寬大，所以發音宏亮；調門雖不高，唱起來却並不比一般為低。</p>
<p>硯秋知道自己天賦嗓子的特殊，就想出一種特殊的唱法，以適應他的天賦，於是就有所謂「程腔」的創造。程腔的特點很多，翻高行低，抑揚頓挫，是重要的一種。翻高時，如海浪發嘯，行低時如柔絲飄蕩。聽唱的人，忽為之驚心動魄，忽為之悠然神往。就是一般愛看不愛聽的朋友，聽了這樣的唱腔，精神也馬上會興奮起來。且硯秋於一字一句之中，常參入抑揚頓挫唱法，勁實乾凈，跌蕩痛快。而其咬字歸韻，又皆循規蹈矩，十分講究。我們從許多地方可以知道：硯秋對於唱法研究的深刻，一字一句，無不用盡苦心，不斷地尋覓新奇悅耳的腔調。所以程腔之能風行一時，實非偶然。學程的人，不但要學他的唱法，允應學他的研究精神！</p>
<h3>新片介紹　春悉</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Spring　Madness”</p>
<p>記得克拉克蓋博主演的一張什麼航空片中，因為愛人不許他從事危險的天空飛行，這位雄赳赳的偉丈夫就「兒女情長」地投入愛人的懷抱中。「春愁」中的大學生沙姆，也同樣和女生亞麗絲談情說愛即放棄游歷蘇俄之行。這是好萊塢劇作家的專長：懋愛，戀愛，戀愛，把國家，事業，都放在後面。</p>
<p>不但此也，在「春愁」中的男學生，通過了劇作者的戀愛至上主義而變成飽煖終日，無所事事，除了談愛。那些女學生呢？和一個男干在跳舞的時候，竟不知他就是教授，而問起尊姓大名來。或許這是一噱頭」，以之博取觀衆的譁笑，但是我笑得很不自然。走出戲院，遇到一個留學過美國的朋友，他說：「很有趣！美國確是有這種情形！」不禁愕然者久之。</p>
<p>導演者自然也儘量在這些男女大學生身上製造笑料。那個里賓柯特寫成那樣一個「有趣」的人物，就是很好的例子。而著名出版家，警察長，以及大學教授等的甘受「娘子軍」的擺佈，又是一個例子。</p>
<p>瑪琳歐莎麗文的戲不多。但和劉亞理斯在健身房中的一塲戲，穿着雙槓架往返徘徊，將小女兒的心事曲曲傳出，及回到臥屋哭訴的幾個鏡頭，演得非常動人。而且在明暗的光綫下，她掀着裙角飛旋，及在雙槓架中央時的一個拉鐘頭，攝影漂亮之至。</p>
<p>激流劇社原定於本月二十二日起舉行首次星期公演，因手續關係，次延至本月二十九日上午十時，仍假辣斐大劇塲正式演出，至於劇本仍為芷茵編之「米商」—原名米—（王竹友導演）及巴金翻譯亞米契斯原著之「過客之花」（鄭重導演）。舞台監督則為傳威廉，並有陳歌辛弦樂隊伴奏。並聞二十二日所發出之券一概通用。</p>
<p>徐慕雲主編之「梨國影事」，為研究戲劇最完美之書籍，古今名伶照片三百張，五彩劇照臉譜數十種，文字亦不下十萬言，耗資鉅萬，故備極考究。上月會以餘書二百部在河南路四馬路南曉星書店廉價出售，定價八元，今僅售三元，售完即行截止。</p>

<h3>蘇聯新片　「白衣公主」</h3>
<p>普希金的作品，譯成中文，歷年來，為數已經不少，他的故事詩，也有很多譯了過來，如「魚和漁夫的故事等，是比較出名的。他的最長一首童話詩，也許因為有幾千句的原故罷，直到現在還沒有中譯本出現。這詩原名「魯斯郎與劉德米拉」，寫俄國古代基也夫國王的事跡，裹面夾雜許多歷代野老的傳言，渲染得神離奇怪。這篇長詩經普希金同時代的大作曲家格林卡編成歌劇，第一次一八四二年在彼得堡上演。今年蘇聯戲劇節的劇目裹，也有這一個歌劇。</p>
<p>去年蘇聯莫斯科影片工廠又把這俄國婦孺皆知的童話詩，搬上銀幕，許多神怪的塲面，用新的技巧，拍攝了出來。假使說這是神怪片，當然是不恰當的，但是却值得我一看蘇聯是怎樣處理神怪的題材的，該片自二十七日起便將在滬光開映。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>烏龍院劇中的金銀問題</p>
<p>倘按老詞就是「這是黃金一錠，待我收下，」並無買糖吃那一說。雖嫌直突一些，但是於理無乖，更不至於弄得生說金。旦說銀，同時同地竟把一樣東西裝上兩個不同的名稱了。還有一層，末後宋江殺死閻氏，閻婆哀吿道：「看在老身分上，賞他棺木一口。」生白：「這有十兩紋銀，你去辦來。」看客們不可誤會，怎麼宋江剛從婆惜懷裏掏出金子書信，向自己懷中一塞，這時冉取出來遞給閻婆，就變成十兩紋銀了呢。果眞照這樣想，那可擰啦。因為中國戲是象徵的，前台上值塲的人拿着那一錠假元寶，逢到相當的節骨眼時，只知暗向劇中人手中遞去，金也是它，銀也是它，多也是它，少也是它，遞來遞去，就是這一隻，至於呌它是金是銀，或造分量或輕或重，這全在劇中人的唱唸詞裹來定它的價值，觀衆要明白這一層，就可知道宋三爺身邊決不會連一錠十兩紋銀都不帶的。要眞是出門時和癟三一樣，竟打算白吃白喝，那他也不會被人　為及時雨或義士宋江了。由此可見隨後取出來的，並不是先前塞進懷裹的那錠黃金，然則生角先唸黃金，此處又說紋銀，實與旦角的明明以金當銀逈乎不同，所以這並不得謂為是生角的錯處呢。中國戲着實太曲折了，雖有說明書，有時看戲的人還不了然，所以我提出以上幾點，算是補說明書的不足吧。（一二七）</p>

<h3>Intense Fighting Near Qinggang Station: Fierce Battles at Taolin and Xitang; Japanese Troops West of Wu'ning Shell the Putian Bridge Area; Chinese Troops in Southern Hubei Capture Jinniuzhen, Northeast of Xianning</h3>
<p>Guilin: Fierce battles have continued for days near Qinggang Station, north of Xinqiang, with intense fighting still ongoing in the areas of Taolin and Xitang. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: Japanese artillery on Luowa Mountain, west of Wu'ning, heavily bombarded the area northeast of Sanzhengang near Putian Bridge on the morning of the 22nd. They also released sneezing gas from the northern end of Putian Bridge towards the Chinese troops, poisoning over thirty Chinese officers and soldiers. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>Changsha: Chinese troops, penetrating deep behind Japanese lines in southern Hubei, briefly captured Jinniuzhen, northeast of Xianning, on the night of the 23rd, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. They completely burned down two Japanese ammunition depots on the southern street of Jinniuzhen. Subsequently, Japanese troops from Hesheng Bridge heard the news and rushed to reinforce, and the Chinese troops withdrew safely elsewhere. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>Gaoan: It is reported that the Japanese troops, who were driven back by the Chinese army near Fengxin, buried over five hundred bodies in the Shangning area. Among them were several officers, including Japanese infantry captain Horiguchi Takeshi and transport corps lieutenant Hirohira Toshio. Additionally, there were over one thousand two hundred and thirty unburied Japanese corpses, along with the bodies of Chinese men, women, and residents who were brutally murdered. The magnitude of Japanese casualties and the brutality towards the Chinese populace can be seen from this. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>Sihui: Chinese troops have been attacking the Japanese on two routes, from Xinkai and Xinhe, for days, achieving numerous victories. On the evening of the 19th, the Xinkai route captured Jitang, killing over two hundred Japanese. On the Xinhe route, they charged into the Japanese positions several times, killing many more in hand-to-hand combat. The remaining Japanese held their fortifications, afraid to move rashly, while the Chinese continued their fierce attacks. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiushui: The Japanese troops in Jing'an have suffered heavy casualties from continuous attacks by the Chinese army. On the 19th, they gathered over a thousand remaining troops, along with six artillery pieces, and launched a fierce counterattack near Sigutai and Renyinli. Another force attempted to outflank the Chinese, but the Chinese troops intercepted them in separate engagements, inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. Fierce fighting continued near Lion Mountain until late at night. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a spokesman for the Chinese army, as of mid-October, a total of 40,000 Japanese troops had arrived in Wuhan and were dispatched to the front lines in Hunan for rotation. On the 20th of this month, another 20,000 Japanese reinforcements arrived. Chinese military personnel anticipate that once the current continuous rain stops, the Japanese will begin a long-planned general offensive, advancing from east to west along the two Xiang-Gan highways, attempting to invade Changsha again. The Chinese army has strengthened its defenses in the area expected to become a war zone, preparing to offer strong resistance if the Japanese attack Changsha. (25th, Haitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to a military spokesman, the battles in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi in the past week have been most intense around Fengxin and Gaoan. After the Chinese army recaptured the strategic stronghold of Xiushui, they launched fierce attacks on the Japanese troops in Fengxin and Wu'ning. Through several nights of bloody fighting, the Chinese army has made significant progress on both fronts. On the Dongxin front, after capturing Maxingshan and Baimaogang, the Chinese army launched a fierce assault on Fengxin city. On the Wu'ning front, after capturing Putian Bridge, the vanguard of the Chinese army has approached the outskirts of Wu'ning city. Therefore, the Japanese troops in Fengxin and Wu'ning are now in a state of decline. In order to relieve the siege of Fengxin, the Japanese dispatched troops from Nanchang to launch fierce attacks on the Chinese in the Ji'an area. The brave soldiers in that area fought valiantly and repelled the Japanese. The defeated Japanese troops are in disarray, and the Chinese army is pursuing them closely. (24th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Recapture Stronghold Northeast of Huguan, Annihilating Over Four Hundred Japanese Soldiers; Japanese Advance Southwest of Yicheng Foiled</h3>
<p>Shaanzhou: On the 20th, Chinese troops attacked Japanese troops in the Zhuangtou Village area (northeast of Huguan). The Japanese resisted stubbornly from their fortifications, but after a fierce assault and close combat, over four hundred Japanese soldiers were annihilated, and the stronghold was recaptured. The Chinese army is currently pressing on towards Huguan. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tongguan: On the evening of the 18th, Chinese troops attacked Yicheng. A unit approached the South Gate and engaged the Japanese in fierce fighting. Another unit used a surprise attack to flank the east and west sides of Yicheng. After several hours of intense fighting, many Japanese were killed. The next day, Japanese troops from Dajiaozhen and Nanjiangzhen (southwest of Yicheng) attacked Motou Village, Che Village, and other places but were bravely repelled by the Chinese army, with over one hundred and fifty Japanese soldiers killed. (24th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Japanese Failure to Invade Changsha</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to a Chinese military spokesman today, there are many reasons for the failure of the Japanese invasion of Changsha, but insufficient preparation was one of them. The Japanese originally planned to mobilize heavy troops from the Japanese mainland and "Manchukuo" before launching an attack on Changsha. However, the Japanese troops in northern Hunan advanced lightly towards Changsha before the reinforcements were concentrated, resulting in failure. According to the Chinese spokesman, 40,000 troops mobilized by the Japanese from "Manchukuo" and the Japanese mainland arrived in Hankou between October 1st and October 15th, and another 20,000 arrived in Hankou between October 19th and 20th. These 60,000 troops were originally intended to assist the Japanese troops in northern Hunan in attacking Changsha, but their arrival was too late, rendering them ineffective. (25th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Report on New Chinese Air Force</h3>
<p>Tokyo: According to reports received here today, the Chinese government is currently rebuilding a new air force, some of which is piloted by Soviet pilots. The Japanese estimate that the Chinese currently have three bomber squadrons and four fighter squadrons, piloted by Chinese personnel. They also have four heavy bomber squadrons and one fighter squadron, piloted by Soviet aviation personnel. As of the end of September, the Chinese military had 340 aircraft, including 110 light bombers, 190 fighters, 20 reconnaissance aircraft, and 29 heavy bombers. In addition, the Chinese government has 250 training aircraft and 12 transport aircraft without combat equipment. (25th, Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Attack Sichuan</p>
<p>Chongqing: At approximately 8:00 AM on the 25th, 36 Japanese planes were spotted in Tongguan, Shaanxi, flying southwest, passing through Shaanxi province and entering northern Sichuan. After passing through Guangyuan and other places, they circled around Chengdu, turned east, and reached the skies over Nanchong, where they circled for a long time, observing, but did not drop any bombs. They then turned back and flew along the original route. The local defense command issued an air raid alert, which was lifted about an hour later. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: On the night of the 24th, Japanese planes took advantage of the moonlight to attack Sichuan in two waves. The first wave, a large formation, attacked Wushan and Fengjie in eastern Sichuan, dropping bombs and fleeing. The second wave was divided into two groups. The first group flew west along the Yangtze River, passing through ××××, attempting to attack Chengdu from the west. However, after reaching ××, due to the darkness, they were unable to find their target after circling for a long time. They then turned back, flying southeast through ××××, passing over Chongqing, and then fleeing east. The second group flew to ××, dropped bombs, and then fled east through ××. The local air defense command issued an emergency alert, which was lifted on the morning of the 25th. (24th dispatch)</p>
<p>Yuanling: Five Japanese planes flew over Yuanling City at random on the 25th, circled once, and then flew south. They then turned back at Chenxi, invaded the city airspace, and dropped forty to fifty bombs in the city suburbs, including several incendiary bombs. After dropping the bombs, the Japanese planes fled along the original route. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xi'an: Thirty-five Japanese planes flew west through Tongguan at 9:30 AM on the 25th, passed through Lantian and Zhashui, and intruded into northern Sichuan for reconnaissance. They then turned back, dropped bombs in Nanzheng, and flew over the city airspace at approximately 2:00 PM before fleeing east. (25th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fuzhou: Four Japanese planes flew from Zhejiang to attack Fuding in eastern Fujian on the 24th. This morning, another five planes dropped bombs in Lupu, Ningde, passing through Fuding and Fu'an. One or two Japanese planes were also seen patrolling the coast in southern Fujian. (25th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Jiangmen: Puppet Troops Revolt</h3>
<p>Gaoan: The Chinese army's attack on Jiangmen is progressing rapidly. On the evening of the 17th, as the Chinese army approached the outskirts of Jiangmen and was engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese, a unit of the puppet Forward Force led by He Ping, which was stationed in Jiangmen, suddenly revolted behind the Japanese lines. In a joint attack, countless Japanese were killed or wounded. The Chinese army seized the opportunity to charge into Jiangmen and set fire to the Japanese barracks and warehouses. He's unit has now surrendered to the Chinese army and is being reorganized. (24th dispatch)</p>

<p>General Bai Chongxi Speaks</p>
<h3>China Can Continue the War of Resistance Even Without Much Foreign Aid; The U.S. Should Prohibit Supplying Japan with Military Raw Materials; If Japan Gains Power in China, All Countries Will Lose Their Interests; Hopes That the French Will Not Hinder Transportation in Southern China</h3>
<p>Nanyue: According to General Bai Chongxi's remarks yesterday to an Associated Press reporter, the only way for the U.S. to protect its interests in the Far East is to prohibit the supply of military raw materials to Japan. "The American people should not only focus on the present but must look to the distant future. They should not only talk about the Open Door Policy in the Nine-Power Treaty but must further suspend the sale of military raw materials to Japan." If the U.S. can implement this consistent policy, it will not only greatly assist China but also maintain American interests in the Far East. "Of course, China can continue the war of resistance even without much foreign aid, but it will be difficult to prevent Japan from endangering American interests. This is a feeling shared by Britain and France, as they have also suffered greatly at the hands of the Japanese. Therefore, the U.S., Britain, and France should cooperate in the Far East." The General cited the seven European wars as examples, saying that the U.S. participation in the last war was "to uphold justice, thus shortening the war. This was a far-sighted action by the U.S." "Currently, U.S. President Roosevelt is like Wilson, standing up for justice. However, although there are many far-sighted Americans, a few isolated factions are often short-sighted and unable to recognize the truth of the world. They prioritize the interests of arms dealers over noble principles, so when a bill to prohibit the sale of arms to aggressor nations is about to pass, they try to obstruct it in every way. This attitude sacrifices the principle of security on which trade depends. What more can be said about their shortsightedness? If security is lost in the Far East due to such attitudes, then once Japan gains power in China, the interests of all countries will inevitably be lost." General Bai also expressed "extreme dissatisfaction" with the actions of the French authorities in Annam to restrict Chinese imports (such as gasoline and steel). "Frankly speaking, we are extremely dissatisfied with this restriction implemented by the French after the outbreak of the European war. We have protested to the French, and sometimes the French have slightly relaxed this restriction, but to this day, the French authorities in Annam are again implementing restrictions. The purpose of the current restrictions is incomprehensible. At the very least, the actions of the French are akin to helping Japan." According to General Bai, the actions of the French are due to fear of Japan. "But it must be known that what Japan wants is not only the interests of China but also the interests of France, Britain, and the U.S. in the Far East. If China cannot defend its interests, then it will certainly be unable to protect the interests of third countries in the Far East. Conversely, if China can maintain its interests against Japan, then the interests of third countries will also be safe, because our interests are largely harmonious and consistent with the interests of third countries. Now that the European war has broken out, we no longer expect France to provide any assistance to China. All we expect is that the French will "keep the transportation lines in southern China open" and not hinder them." General Bai declined to express his views on the European war but said, "We stand on the side of our friendly countries." When asked whether Britain and France would exert pressure on Japan after their victory, General Bai replied, "If I were in the same situation, I would do the same." According to General Bai, it will take no less than two months for the Japanese army to recover after its defeat in northern Hunan. Therefore, the new offensive will be two months later. The Chinese strategy has not changed at present, but the Chinese are prepared for a large-scale counteroffensive. However, this counteroffensive will depend on the following three factors: China's army training and equipment, the morale of the Japanese army and political changes in Tokyo, and changes in the international situation.

<p>Zhu Jiahua Speaks to Reuters Reporter</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army, Having Failed in Its Invasion of Northern Hunan, Spreads Various Rumors in an Attempt to Cover Up the Truth of Its Military Failure and Fulfill Its Conspiracy of Discord</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Zhu Jiahua, Secretary-General of the Central Party Headquarters, met with a Reuters reporter on the evening of the 24th. In response to inquiries about various rumors circulating recently, he replied, "I once told a reporter from the New York Times that the enemy country's dispatch of Shigenori Nishio to China was nothing more than a last-ditch effort." Indeed, the enemy army launched a large-scale offensive in Hunan, heading straight for Changsha, but unexpectedly, it was met with a head-on blow from our army and suffered a defeat. They then resorted to their old trick of fabricating various rumors, hoping to cover up the truth of their military failure and fulfill their conspiracy of discord. These rumors are not worth a smile from knowledgeable people and are not worth refuting. I will give a few examples. For example, the enemy spread the rumor that "Britain is advising China to make peace with Japan," and that "the Soviet Union is making coercive demands on the National Government." Not only are these rumors completely unfounded, but they are also contemptible propaganda that lacks all common sense. Since the War of Resistance, China has adhered to its established national policy, acting decisively and striving with all its might. Whether in internal affairs, diplomacy, military affairs, or construction, although there are myriad details, they all lead to the same goal. What is this goal? It is to target Japanese aggression, to shatter its dream of conquest, to restore the integrity of our territory and sovereignty, and to preserve our independence and freedom. As for peace, the enemy country is mired in an inextricable quagmire and desperately hopes for a "quick peace and quick decision." As for China, unless the Japanese warlords thoroughly repent and completely withdraw all their troops from our territory, there is no room for consideration. Such a firm stance cannot be changed by any environment, nor can it be swayed by any intention. Our Central Government has repeatedly declared this to the world. Moreover, the mission that China is currently undertaking in its heroic struggle is to fight for the maintenance of human justice. Countries with superior culture and a sense of justice will naturally continue to sympathize with and assist us, and this will last for a long time. As for the mutual cooperation between the Soviet Union and us, it has remained unwavering from beginning to end. The Soviet Ambassador to China, Pan Youxin, made this clear in his congratulatory remarks when presenting his credentials. Where does the so-called "coercive demands" come from? Since the viewpoints are consistent and the interests are the same, it is inevitable in terms of both principle and reason. In summary, the relationship between China and Britain and China and the Soviet Union is exceptionally close. We only see the friendship between each other increasing day by day. This ironclad fact lies before our eyes, and there is no need to say more. Therefore, if similar rumors occur in the future, they will be nothing more than a desperate and absurd expression of the enemy, and they will be completely unfounded. Zhu also mentioned the Chongqing news published in the English version of the Shanghai Great American Evening Post on the 21st regarding Japan's three proposed ceasefire conditions to China, saying that he did not know where the Great American Evening Post obtained this news. The publication of such a nonsensical rumor by the newspaper is enough to make its credibility and value plummet. Finally, the reporter asked Zhu for his views on the European situation. Zhu said, "The outbreak of the European war is truly a great misfortune for mankind, but I hope that a reasonable solution can be found so that Europe can regain its light." (25th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>China's Foreign Trade and Japan</h3>
<p>The Chinese government's control over wartime foreign trade began in March of last year. However, the restrictions on import and export commodities at that time were not very strict, resulting in a trade deficit of 120 million yuan last year, which further increased to 320 million yuan in the first half of this year. In order to balance international payments, the government strengthened control over foreign trade starting in June of this year, prohibiting the import of non-essential and luxury goods and increasing the quantity of export goods through various incentives. Since its implementation, it has been quite effective. In August, there was a trend of reduced imports and increased exports. The situation improved further in September: according to figures released by the Customs, the value of imported foreign goods was 93 million yuan, a decrease of 35 million compared to August; the export value was 85 million yuan, a decrease of 15 million compared to August; the trade deficit dropped to 8 million yuan. This is the smallest amount in the first nine months of this year.</p>
<p>A trade deficit of 8 million yuan in September was not a particularly alarming figure before January of this year: not only were there many months with even smaller figures, but there were also trade surpluses from October to December of the previous year and from June to September of last year. However, we must understand that the situation in the previous two years was completely different from the recent one: First, a year ago, from Ningbo along the coast southward to Guangzhou Bay, China still had several ports for handling imports and exports, which were both controlled and utilized. Recently, there are almost no ports for handling imports and exports. Second, when China had a trade surplus in the past, the amount of foreign trade that the Chinese government could control was relatively large, and at the same time, the Japanese side had not yet paid attention to the foreign trade in the occupied areas due to their busy military operations. The recent situation is exactly the opposite of the past: the expansion of the war zone has reduced the amount of trade that the government can control; and Japan is also making every effort to control trade in the occupied areas. Estimating the trade in the war zone based on peacetime economic geography, the war zone accounts for more than 80 percent of the national trade volume. Therefore, during wartime, due to the movement of population and capital, and production tools, and the changes in consumable goods, this percentage is of course inaccurate; however, it is truly commendable that the trade deficit has been reduced this time. The reason for this is partly due to the government's effective control and partly due to the fact that most people can conscientiously abide by national laws to express their loyalty to the country. As for the impact of the European War, although it has a considerable relationship, it is for both imports and exports.</p>
<p>China's foreign trade, like the entire China, has unlimited prospects. The foreign trade directly controlled by it has long become a favorable trend: from January to August of this year, the foreign trade deficit outside the war zone has turned into a deficit of 43 million yuan; and the southwestern customs still have more trade surpluses. Recently, the government has been able to reduce the trade deficit within the occupied areas by various methods. This is a success of China's trade policy and a clear evidence of Japan's relative inferiority in the economic struggle. Moreover, judging from the future trend, it will further enable China's foreign trade to achieve very smooth development: because Japan's economic activities in the occupied areas, on the one hand, are attempting to expand its own economic power, and at the same time, it is also excluding the rights and interests of third parties in order to monopolize everything; it is not only excluding the trade of European and American countries with China, but even prohibiting the trade of European and American countries with China. For example, the long-term blockade of the Yangtze River is a clear example. However, Japan's monopolistic actions have recently been deeply resented by the relevant countries in Europe and the United States: those who originally made concessions to Japan now hope to turn to retaliation. The Shanghai British Chamber of Commerce recently published a communique openly criticizing Japan's so-called "Far East New Order" as actually "Far East Disorder," and therefore expressed their need for some "fresh air." This represents the general opinion of British merchants in the occupied areas. The American overseas Chinese in Shanghai also sent a telegram to the American government not long ago, requesting that the amendment to the Neutrality Act avoid being unfavorable to China. A Washington telegram stated that the US Senate verbally voted to allow American ships to sail in the Pacific, which is undoubtedly an indication that the United States will never give up the opportunity for trade with China. We can also refer to the fact that the US government has recently repeatedly expressed a tough attitude on the Far East issue, which clearly shows that it has the determination to protect its rights and interests in China. Isn't this enough to break Japan's attempt to monopolize China's wartime foreign trade and greatly help the natural development of China's wartime foreign trade?</p>
<p>However, some people may think that even if Britain, the United States, and other countries can remove obstacles to trade with China and operate freely, but because China lacks important coastal ports that it can control, the result may still inevitably indirectly benefit the economic resources controlled by Japan in the occupied areas. In fact, this is also an unnecessary worry: we must know that under the current Japanese blockade policy, imported goods from European and American countries are completely blocked; and exports to European and American countries must also be monopolized by the Japanese side before they can be exported. As long as we achieve the goal of breaking the Japanese monopoly policy, we will expose the failure of Japanese economic activities in the occupied areas, and at the same time, it will be nothing less than a new opportunity for China's foreign trade! The subtle key lies in the fact that if Japan cannot give up aggression, it cannot establish a normal relationship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, and it cannot develop normal industry and commerce. At the same time, it can also be asserted that if Japan does not give up aggression, it will never implement its promise to open its doors and respect the rights and interests of all countries.</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister's Speech in Danzig: Determined to Accept British Challenge, Saying Britain Should Bear the Primary Responsibility for the War, Unwilling to Make Peace Without Guaranteed Security</h3>
<p>Danzig - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop delivered a speech here last night to the public, broadcast by all German radio stations and translated into various languages for broadcast abroad. The main points of the speech were: (1) vehemently criticizing Britain, accusing Britain of imposing war on Germany; (2) the restoration of the inherent friendly relations between Germany and the Soviet Union; (3) Germany has no ambitions towards the Americas; (4) Danzig will never be separated from Germany again.</p>
<p>Ribbentrop's conclusion stated, "We will never make peace until we have a guarantee that such attacks on the German people will never happen again. We firmly believe that we are in the right. We tried our best to avert the war imposed on us until the very last minute. With this belief, we will fight to the end with all our energy, only when Germany wins a great victory. Our country will use all its strength and trust in the greatest figure among us, our leader, to deal with the enemy," (Reuter's dispatch, 25th).</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop</p>
<p>Danzig - German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop delivered a speech in Danzig last night, reviewing the Polish war and the course of Britain and France's declaration of war against Germany. Ribbentrop declared that he believed the world knew that the French did not want to fight, and that the British government had systematically planned a decisive battle against Germany since the Munich Conference, so they used the Polish incident as an excuse to provoke Germany. After Hitler's peace proposal was rejected, Germany decided to accept this challenge, and the German people should be determined not to lay down their arms halfway until national security is guaranteed.</p>
<p>Ribbentrop briefly described the history of Danzig and the German-Polish relations over the past six years, declaring that exactly one year ago, he was ordered by Leader Hitler to propose to the Polish ambassador to Germany, Lipski, to politically merge Danzig with Germany and maintain economic ties with Poland, and at the same time propose the construction of railways and highways, mutual recognition of borders, and the extension of the 1934 non-aggression pact for twenty-five years. At that time, Leader Hitler also personally reiterated this intention to Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. On March 21st of this year, he again proposed to Lipski for the third time to discuss that German-Polish relations must be clarified, and invited Polish Foreign Minister Beck to come to Germany for negotiations. Unexpectedly, Lipski submitted a memorandum on the 25th of the same month that was equivalent to a complete rejection of Ribbentrop's proposal, claiming that "If the German plan is forced again, it is tantamount to wanting to fight against Poland." At the same time, Poland increased the persecution of Germans and strengthened the troops on the German-Polish border. Germany tolerated it for half a year, until the Polish army invaded, it could not but respond with force. Now, Germany has personally seen the division of the area of ​​interest and the realization of true peace. Germany and Russia will forever be the guarantee of a peaceful and orderly Eastern Europe.</p>
<h3>Peaceful Efforts Fruitless</h3>
<p>At this point, Ribbentrop elaborated on German foreign policy, declaring that since January 30, 1933, the purpose of German foreign policy has been to destroy the Treaty of Versailles and eliminate all the consequences caused by it, and has achieved some success by methods that do not shed a drop of blood. Britain has repeatedly obstructed this, while Germany has still made various efforts to attempt to obtain a reasonable agreement with Britain and France. In the summer of 1933, Germany proposed a meeting between the German and French Prime Ministers Hitler and Daladier, and the plan was on the verge of being decided, but was then cancelled by Daladier. Is this not a historical regret? Since Hitler came to power, the foundation of German foreign policy has been to promote British-German relations. Hitler's repeated speeches and Ribbentrop's repeated trips to London were all specifically for obtaining British-German understanding. This is not just empty talk, but a concrete proposal. Ribbentrop, in the name of Leader Hitler, proposed the following four points to the British Prime Minister, Foreign Secretary, and other politicians:</p>
<p>(1) British-German naval understanding, based on the ratio of 35 to 100; (2) eternal guarantee of the integrity of the Netherlands, Belgium, and France; (3) Germany respects British interests throughout the world, and Britain respects German interests in Eastern Europe; (4) British-German defensive alliance, stipulating that Germany is willing to provide its fleet and some of its land army for British command to protect the British Empire.</p>
<p>As a result, the response from British politicians and public opinion has been to inform the Germans that Britain does not need German friendship.</p>
<h3>No Conflict of Interest Between Soviet Union and Germany</h3>
<p>Regarding German-Soviet relations, Ribbentrop declared that the vital interests of the two countries are interconnected, do not conflict, economic needs are mutually complementary, and territorial disputes will never occur. The people of the two countries have expressed great enthusiasm for the non-aggression pact and border friendship agreement. German-Soviet relations have reached a final and clear foundation, and this friendship will only deepen day by day.</p>
<h3>Germany Has Absolutely No Ambitions Towards the Americas</h3>
<p>As for German-American relations, Germany has always respected the American Monroe Doctrine. Germany has no interest in the American continent except for commercial relations. When Britain has repeatedly spread news of discord between Germany and the United States, Germany has always hoped that Americans can see through their tricks with common sense and understand that only friendship between Germany and the United States is beneficial to both sides.</p>
<h3>Who Should Be Held Responsible for the War?</h3>
<p>At this point, Ribbentrop discussed the question of "who is the culprit of this war," declaring that the world knows that France does not want to fight. There is no doubt that France is willing to negotiate peace, but it is forced to fight. In fact, the British government has been secretly making organized preparations for war for more than a day. Since the Munich Conference, Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately announced a huge military buildup plan, which proves that Chamberlain's trip to Munich was not to stop the war but to delay it. Therefore, when Germany annexed the Sudetenland, the British government did not use force, because its military was not sufficient, it was not unwilling to do so. When the Polish incident occurred, the British government's guarantee was specifically aimed at Germany, not advising Poland to consider peace proposals, but encouraging it to fight. When Italian Prime Minister Mussolini made a final mediation proposal on September 2nd, it was still possible to pull back from the brink, but Chamberlain stubbornly refused.</p>
<h3>Germany Has No Other Demands Than Colonies</h3>
<p>The British side has publicized that Germany has the ambition to dominate the world. In fact, Germany has absolutely no colonies, while Britain has 611 autonomous territories, colonies, protectorates, and mandated territories. This kind of slander can be refuted without any explanation. Hitler has repeatedly stated that Germany's diplomatic objectives are no more than three points:</p>
<p>(1) To allow Germans to live in their natural territory; (2) To guarantee the German people an appropriate standard of living; (3) To enable the German people to develop their culture.</p>
<p>Now Germany's unification work has ended, the Treaty of Versailles has been cancelled, and Germany's borders in all four directions have been finally determined. Germany has no other demands from Britain and France except to recover its old colonies. However, the central government believes that today is the time for Britain and Germany to fight. This policy is a gamble on the fate of the British Empire, and in history, it may be the British Empire digging its own grave. If it is said that Germany has kept its promises, then Britain's violation of the Munich Agreement is not a breach of promise. Chamberlain's so-called peace is to return to the Treaty of Versailles, to stop National Socialism, in other words, to make the German nation cease to exist and the European situation to fall into chaos, but this will never be done. Germany has now decided to accept Chamberlain's challenge and will never lay down its arms until Germany's security is guaranteed, so that the German nation will never again be threatened by this kind of attack.

<h3>English and French Newspapers' Comments: No Novel Points Seen, Considered To Be Issued Domestically</h3>
<p>London - Official sources here have commented on the speech delivered by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop yesterday, saying that it was issued domestically, and even before a lengthy study, it is known that it has no novel points and no special importance. However, Germany's attempt to alienate Britain and France can be clearly seen here. Ribbentrop also wanted to try his best to conceal the truth before the German people, and did not hesitate to distort Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy when he concluded the Munich Agreement last September. This kind of lie is difficult for even a three-year-old child to believe (Havas, 25th).</p>
<p>London - The speech delivered by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Danzig last night, accusing Britain of preparing for war long ago, has not been criticized by most newspapers here today. Although it was published with headlines such as "barbaric accusations" and "exaggerations of the disturbed," only the "Daily Mail" and "News Chronicle" still consider it to be of value for discussion and criticism. The "Daily Mail" said that the world has seen a mixture of distorted facts, insincere words, and pure lies. The "News Chronicle" said that what Ribbentrop said did not make the key point of why people oppose Nazism any weaker. What is this key point? That is, Germany has destroyed all hope of a peaceful settlement and repeatedly violated promises to engage in aggression while pursuing its greed and ambition (Reuter, 25th).</p>
<p>Paris - Few newspapers here have commented on the speech delivered by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Danzig yesterday, and they said that this speech has no novel points, and its function is domestic rather than external. The "Right-wing Order Newspaper" stated, "All that a vulgar person can say has now been added. The remarks made by the leaders of the National Socialist Party are shameless, just like their actions. The main goal of Ribbentrop's speech is to conceal the predicament created by the country's leader Hitler from the German people." The "Right-wing Daily" stated, "This speech did not add any new factors to the current international situation. It is really not worth it to spend two hours consulting with Hitler before publishing such ordinary words." (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>Denmark - "National Daily" reported that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's speech showed that the offensive will only be against Britain and its territories from now on (Reuter, 25th).</p>

<h3>Another Four British Ships Sunk by German Submarines, Most of the Crew Rescued by American Ships, One Swedish and One Greek Ship Sunk in the North Sea</h3>
<p>Gibraltar - It is heard that the British ship "Taffna" was sunk by a German submarine on October 24 (Reuter, 25th).</p>
<p>London - Another three British ships were attacked by German submarines. The three ships are the "Kranjichsom" (2,647 tons) cargo ship "Lightburg" (3,528 tons) and the "Manning Lodge." In addition, one Swedish and one Greek ship of neutral countries were sunk by German mines or German submarines. According to the announcement of the US Maritime Commission in Washington, the US ship "Kronstad" has rescued five survivors of the "Manning Lodge" and the entire crew of the "Lightburg." Both of these ships were sunk in the North Atlantic. Twenty-two crew members of the "Manning Lodge" are missing. The Greek ship lost was the "Hachibataoras" (4,684 tons), which was sunk by a German submarine in the North Sea. Fifteen crew members were rescued by a British ship and transferred to lifeboats to land. Three crew members and a British pilot are still missing. When the rescued people arrived in England in lifeboats, they were taken to a seafarer's dormitory by ambulances (Reuter, 25th).</p>
<p>Oslo, Norway - According to the crew of the "Stonemont" who arrived in Norway yesterday, the "Stonemont" was not sunk by a German submarine, but by the pocket battleship "Deutschland." The crew of the "Stonemont" were all rescued by the pocket battleship (Haitong Dispatch, 25th).</p>
<p>London - First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill recently stated in the House of Commons that the circumstances surrounding the sinking of the battleship "Royal Oak" are being investigated urgently. It is difficult to know exactly when a report can be submitted, but it is hoped that the results of the investigation can be reported next week (Havas, 25th).</p>
<h3>British Prime Minister to Deliver Speech in House of Commons, Responding to German Foreign Minister's Remarks</h3>
<p>London - Sources say that Prime Minister Chamberlain intends to make a statement in the House of Commons this afternoon to respond to the speech delivered by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Danzig. However, according to well-informed sources, the Prime Minister will not make any response when the House of Commons meets today, but will address it when submitting the weekly report in the House of Commons tomorrow (Havas, 25th).</p>
<h3>Roman Silence</h3>
<p>Rome - People here originally thought that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop would definitely avoid directly mentioning the two Allied countries of Britain and France when he delivered his speech yesterday. Now that Ribbentrop has attacked Britain so fiercely, it is quite surprising. Many Italian political figures said that Germany should adopt a large-scale offensive in all three aspects of land, sea, and air, but official sources refused to express their opinions. All newspapers have been ordered to be cautious in their words when publishing comments (Havas, 25th).</p>
<h3>Berlin Denies Military Conference</h3>
<p>Berlin - The German official news agency stated that the attitude adopted by Germany after British Prime Minister Chamberlain rejected the German peace proposal is well known. Germany sees no reason to launch a new peace movement. The official arena has considered the rumor that Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have made extremely important discussions on the international situation in the past few days to be unfounded, and that the ambassadors stationed in the Soviet Union and Italy have been ordered to send special reports to the German government is also inconsistent with the facts. The news about military conferences circulated abroad is also fictitious (Reuter, 25th).</p>
<h3>Hitler Receives Oshima</h3>
<p>Berlin - German Leader Hitler received Japanese Ambassador Oshima at the Prime Minister's Office yesterday. He has been summoned back to his country and is about to depart. Oshima stated that he was instructed by the government to express his firm belief in the continued maintenance of German-Japanese friendly relations (Haitong Dispatch, 25th).</p>
<p>Berlin - Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima was summoned back to his country and is about to depart. Last night, he visited Hitler to bid farewell and presented four pieces of art gifts from a Japanese manufacturer to the German Leader (Reuter, 25th).</p>
<h3>British-French-Turkish Mutual Assistance Treaty Based on Encirclement Policy Italian Newspaper Article Doubts Whether It Can Be a Tool for Peace</h3>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that due to special circumstances, the British-French-Turkish treaty is planned to be signed as soon as possible and will now be submitted to the King for approval. It is hoped that it can be signed in Turkey's capital next week (Reuter, 25th).</p>
<p>Rome - Today's "Italian Daily" published an article by Geda, expressing doubts about whether the British-French-Turkish mutual assistance treaty can be a tool for peace, saying that the starting point of this treaty is based on "the British-French encirclement policy," which aims to prevent Italy's expansion in the Mediterranean. Although Turkey has signed this treaty, it is still affiliated to the Balkan Entente group. This matter has created new problems in the Balkan system. After Albania was incorporated into Italy, Italy's policy extended to the center of the Balkan countries. This is the fundamental point. Some newspapers exaggerated and viewed the signing of the British-French-Turkish treaty as a lover's meeting, wanting to obscure the facts, but Italy turned a deaf ear to it, but will continue to watch the consequences of the evolution of the facts with very sharp eyes (Reuter, 25th).</p>
<h3>Finnish Representative Returns Home for Instructions; Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Interrupted, But Not Necessarily a Breakdown; Rumor of New Soviet Demands</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Finnish delegation returned to its capital this morning at 00:30. The delegation's chief representative, Paasikivi, told reporters before leaving, "I sincerely hope to return here soon to continue negotiations." It is rumored that the Soviet government has made new demands, which cannot be confirmed or denied here. The delegation denied rumors that it would not return or that future negotiations would be conducted through diplomatic channels. However, well-informed sources here still believe the negotiations are very tense and that the delegation still needs to travel back and forth several times. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>The "Electric News" correspondent stationed in the Finnish capital reported that public sentiment had been optimistic about the Finnish-Soviet negotiations, but suddenly turned pessimistic yesterday. This suggests that the Soviet Union has made new demands that the Finnish representatives dare not take responsibility for negotiating and have returned home for instructions. Currently, the Finnish capital is stepping up military preparations, such as calling up reserves and building bomb shelters. This is indeed the case. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: According to reliable sources from Finland, Soviet-Finnish negotiations are expected to resume in Moscow next week. Well-informed sources claim that the new Soviet proposals are merely slight changes to the previous ones and do not constitute new demands. The Finnish government will hold meetings in the next two days to specifically discuss the new Soviet proposals and draft new instructions to be given to chief representative Paasikivi. (Haitong Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London: People in the Finnish capital were surprised when chief Finnish representative Paasikivi returned home just thirty-six hours after arriving in Moscow with other important delegates. It is reported that Paasikivi is seeking instructions from his government because Stalin has made new proposals. According to a Finnish capital dispatch from a Swedish newspaper, this is not a breakdown in negotiations but merely an attempt by the Soviet Union to unnerve Finland. Meanwhile, a dispatch from Rome quoting Moscow claims that the new Soviet proposals include: (1) special rights for the Soviet Union on certain islands in the Gulf of Finland; (2) Finland's commitment not to fortify the Åland Islands; and (3) Finland's commitment not to support any anti-Soviet actions. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Basel, Switzerland: The "News" newspaper recently published a dispatch from its correspondent stationed in Stockholm, stating that despite optimistic views on the current Finnish-Soviet negotiations, there is no factual basis for them. According to reliable sources, Finnish representatives Paasikivi and Tanner looked dejected after a secret meeting with Stalin and Molotov yesterday and immediately reported to the government via long-distance telephone. Officials in the Finnish government also showed signs of unease. However, it is also said that although Paasikivi has returned home for instructions, two other representatives remain in Moscow to discuss various "technical issues" with the Soviet authorities when Paasikivi returns, indicating that negotiations have not broken down. Observers believe that the situation will not develop significantly before the 31st of this month. The Soviet side is likely in no hurry because the European war is raging, and Soviet-Finnish negotiations can proceed at a leisurely pace. Furthermore, the Swedish side attaches great importance to and comments extensively on the return of Soviet Ambassador to Sweden, Madame Kollontai, to report on the meeting of the heads of state of the four Nordic countries.

<h3>German and Soviet Agreement Established; Soviet Union Agrees to Supply Germany with One Million Tons of Grain and Fodder in Two Months</h3>
<p>Berlin: A German official press agency states that Germany and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement in which the Soviet Union will supply Germany with one million tons of grain and fodder within two months. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Moscow: It is announced here that a Soviet economic delegation has departed for Berlin, consisting of 25 representatives, mostly from Soviet economic and engineering circles. The chief representative is the Soviet People's Commissar for the Shipping Industry, Tevosyan. (Haitong Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: It has been learned that several Soviet transportation experts are negotiating with the Estonian Ministry of Economy regarding the transit of Soviet goods through Estonian territory. It is said that the Soviet Union hopes that goods destined for Germany will pass through the Estonian capital, Tallinn, and warehouse leases have been signed, and special transportation agencies have been established.

<h3>In the Warndt Forest Area, German Attacks Repelled; General von Brauchitsch Inspects the Western Front in the West Wall Area</h3>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters has just released War Bulletin No. 101, stating, "Our forces set ambushes in various locations along the front line today and occasionally launched attacks. Enemy forces attacked our forward outposts southeast of the Warndt Forest, resulting in intense fighting. Our forces immediately counterattacked and repelled them." (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>Berlin: General von Brauchitsch, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, is currently inspecting the Western Front and consoling German troops in the Saarbrücken area, where fierce battles have recently taken place. Soldiers with outstanding combat records have been awarded the Iron Cross. (Haitong Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London: The speech given by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop in Danzig last night has led military commentators here to re-evaluate the possibility of a German offensive. Although the front lines are currently experiencing continuous rain and flooding rivers, an offensive is still not difficult. National Socialists are now extremely excited, impatient, and confident. Germans are also feeling impatient with Hitler's indecision. Commentators also believe that German generals cannot allow the large army currently concentrated on the Siegfried Line to remain concentrated in this narrow area for long, so they must either make it fight or withdraw it. French critics say that although the Germans are confident they can break through the Maginot Line, considering the situation of the Eben-Emael fortress, whose construction was far less solid than the Maginot Line during the last major war, it is clear that the Germans will have difficulties. "Le Petit Parisien" published an article by Maurice, stating that British forces are now fighting German aircraft with the latest fighter planes, whose combat capabilities are far superior to the German Messerschmitt aircraft. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Paris: Semi-official sources commented on the war situation, saying that both sides renewed activities in several places along the front line yesterday, with minor clashes, ambushes, or large reconnaissance patrols in the middle of the lines. All of these were local in nature and of no great significance. Both sides have established a new line somewhere in the front and are trying to improve their positions, hoping to repel enemy troops who are hindering their movements. Since the General Headquarters decided to adopt a defensive posture, it has abandoned a large part of the territory occupied in the Warndt Forest area. In the past two days, fierce fighting has taken place with enemy forces southeast of the forest. The high ground of strategic value remains in our hands. When the enemy first attacked, the scale was small, but because our forces resisted strongly, they gradually increased their pressure, and the fighting intensified accordingly. The General Headquarters finally ordered a counterattack to relieve the besieged forward outposts. When War Bulletin No. 101 was released last night, the counterattack was mentioned for the first time since the start of the war. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>The Four Countries of the Near East Will Hold a Meeting to Discuss the International Situation</h3>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey: According to reliable sources, representatives from the Near East Pact signatory countries—Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Afghanistan—will hold a meeting in the near future to discuss the international situation. Preliminary discussions and preparations are underway. The meeting will be held either in the Turkish capital or the Iraqi capital. (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Britain Eager to Promote Trade with Neutral Countries and Plans to Renew Barter Agreement with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>London: Secretary of Commerce Stanley stated in the House of Commons today that Britain would begin to increase its trade with the Netherlands, the Scandinavian Peninsula, and other neutral countries as soon as possible. When members asked if the Secretary of Commerce was aware of Germany's intensified efforts to promote its trade with the Netherlands and the Scandinavian countries, Stanley replied that he had received reports of this nature. The British government is well aware of the importance of promoting British exports to these countries and other overseas markets. The Ministry of Commerce, for this purpose, is beginning discussions with representatives of the export industry to facilitate their operations. He is in constant contact with relevant departments regarding export trade matters. When further asked if the Secretary of Commerce was aware that German industrial groups were distributing leaflets to neutral companies, offering various conveniences to assist their trade in order to counter British trade, Stanley replied that it was doubtful whether the Germans could fulfill the promises in these leaflets. (Reuters Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>London: During the House of Commons session today, members inquired about the issue of Britain and the Soviet Union renewing a new barter agreement suitable for wartime conditions. Foreign Minister Butler replied that the issue was currently under consideration. It is understood that Britain and the Soviet Union recently agreed on an agreement for Britain to exchange rubber and tin for Soviet timber. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japan Leaves the Sterling Bloc; London Not Surprised</h3>
<p>London: Japan's decision to link the yen to the U.S. dollar instead of the pound has not caused surprise or dissatisfaction in financial circles here, but is seen as a reasonable step. It is said that since Britain and France are at war, there will inevitably be some fluctuations in the future levels of the pound and the franc. Japan is now merely following the example of the Scandinavian Peninsula countries in linking its currency to the U.S. dollar. In fact, the main currency currently far from the vortex of war is only the U.S. dollar. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today, foreign exchange transactions were conducted based on the new basis of 23.4375 U.S. cents per 100 Japanese yen, without fluctuations. The British exchange rate remained at one shilling and two pence, based on the British-U.S. exchange rate of 4.01875 U.S. dollars per British pound. Businesspeople here support the government's decision to link the Japanese yen to the U.S. dollar, hoping that this move will not hinder Japan's overall import and export trade. Japanese newspapers all welcomed this decision, with most regretting that it was somewhat late. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>British Aircraft Fly over Germany for Reconnaissance</h3>
<p>London: The Ministry of Aviation has just announced that several of our aircraft flew over the German cities of Berlin, Magdeburg, and Hamburg last night for reconnaissance. At that time, the Hamburg radio station was broadcasting Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's speech in Danzig, which was reportedly interrupted as a result. (Havas, 25th)</p>

<h3>U.S. Secretary of State Hull Denies Conducting Far East Peace Movement; Peace Atmosphere Spread by Japanese Side; United States Encourages China to Continue Resistance</h3>
<p>Washington: Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that he was completely unaware of reports that the United States was conducting a peace movement in the Far East. He had no knowledge of Japanese reports that China, through U.S. Ambassador to China Johnson, had proposed peace to the Japanese. Other government officials also did not acknowledge knowing about the Chinese peace proposal. Some believe that the Japanese reports were caused by a certain party eager to reassure the Japanese people that the end of the Sino-Japanese War was not far off. It is pointed out here that Tokyo sources solemnly declared last week that the end of Japan's war with China was near, and Japanese newspaper commentaries made even more solemn statements about this view. However, well-informed sources here stated that Washington has not received any reliable indications that the end of the Sino-Japanese War is imminent. Officials here are fully aware of Japan's eagerness to end the Sino-Japanese War. However, qualified observers solemnly stated that unless Japan changes its current policies and is willing to negotiate with General Chiang Kai-shek, there is currently no hope for Sino-Japanese peace. Some believe that regardless of the activities of peace elements in Chongqing, the firm stance taken by the United States in the Far East in the past two weeks will encourage China to continue resisting Japan. The Soviet Union's recent aid to China, such as Chinese air raids on Hankou and other Japanese bases, is another indication that China is not prepared to accept peace negotiations based on Japanese conditions.

<h3>United States Actively Expanding the Strength of the Asian Fleet; Naval Department Plans to Continue Sending Warships to Manila; Naval Exercises Will Be Held in the Pacific</h3>
<p>Washington: The Navy Department last night refused to confirm or deny reports that warships currently concentrated in the Hawaiian area would continue to be sent to the Philippines. According to unconfirmed reports, the strength of the "security patrol" recently established by the United States in the Pacific may be increased. The Naval Department plans to continue sending warships to Manila to reinforce the U.S. Asian Fleet. However, the Navy Department remained tight-lipped about the movements of warships in the Hawaiian area. Navy Department officials stated that except for warships stationed on the West Coast returning to West Coast naval shipyards for inspection, current naval policy does not allow for the announcement of warship movements. Therefore, the Navy Department will only be able to publicly announce routine warship movements in the future. Observers recalled the naval authorities recently dispatching an air force squadron and greatly increasing the number of U.S. submarines in the Far East to increase the combat effectiveness of the U.S. East Asian Fleet, considering it to be very important. At this time, the U.S. Navy is continuing preparations for the annual naval exercises. Although the location of the naval exercises in February next year has not been confirmed, preparations are being made on a minute-by-minute basis. Reliable sources indicated that the naval exercises will be held in the Pacific, as a large number of warships are gathered there. Observers pointed out that the Pacific is a reasonable location for the next naval exercises, as the Navy has previously held them in the Atlantic and Caribbean. Since the outbreak of the European war, this issue has become more complicated. Some non-official sources predict that the naval exercises will be held in the Atlantic. The Navy Department refused to comment on this prediction yesterday, stating that the location of the naval exercises has not yet been determined. The possibility of naval exercises being held in the Atlantic is only speculation. Naval experts would be surprised if warships were transferred from the Pacific to the Atlantic for short-term exercises. Navy Department officials stated that the progress of various plans can be changed at any time. Strategists are planning the exercise program, but the Chief of Naval Operations is not yet prepared to make any detailed public announcements. Yesterday, unofficial reports widely circulated that some of the warships currently stationed in Hawaii would be transferred back to the West Coast next year for inspection. It was also reported here that the Navy Department may advance the transfer of these warships to the West Coast so that Navy sailors can spend Christmas with their families.

<h3>United States Prevents Soviet-Japanese Rapprochement; Nomura Will Meet with Grew</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet government newspaper Izvestia recently published a dispatch from a "special correspondent" claiming that responsible parties in the United States believe that Japan is willing to improve relations with the Soviet Union and purchase goods from the Soviet Union so as not to rely entirely on the United States. If this were to be realized, it would strengthen Japan's position, which is not in the U.S.'s interest. Therefore, the U.S. plans to interfere and, using the pretext of pursuing a neutral policy, prevent the rapprochement between Japan and the Soviet Union and isolate Japan. This news has attracted the attention of foreigners here, who say that the U.S.'s expression of sympathy for Britain and France is not pleasing to the Soviet Union, so it is indirectly attacking the U.S. in this way.

<p>Tokyo: At a press conference today, a spokesman for the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs was asked by an American reporter when Foreign Minister Nomura would begin negotiations with U.S. Ambassador Grew. The spokesman replied that Nomura would meet with Grew soon, but he could not say for sure when. It is understood that Nomura recently told reporters that he wanted to freely and frankly exchange views with the U.S. Ambassador on the situation in East Asia. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Strengthens Fishing Fleet</h3>
<p>Moscow: Russia is currently modernizing and expanding its fishing fleet, building some new ships and renovating old ones. Two tugboats, each with 650 horsepower, are currently being built in the Murmansk shipyard. The Northern Fishing Fleet will also add four fishing boats with 60 to 110 horsepower gasoline engines. The Far East Fisheries Agency will add 150 ships and has ordered that all wooden ships be replaced with metal ships next year. (Haitong Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Announces New Military Service Law; Enlistment Age Lowered</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Soviet Supreme Soviet passed a military service law last month, the content of which has just been announced. In addition to reducing the enlistment age for young people from 19 to 18, the military training methods in secondary schools will also be changed. Students must receive military training from the age of 13 until they enlist at the age of 18 (the original method was that students had only three years of military training before enlisting at the age of 19). (Havas Dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Protests German Seizure of U.S. Ship; Demands Full Explanation from Germany; Soviet Union Considering Releasing the Ship</h3>
<p>Washington: The U.S. State Department has instructed the U.S. Embassy in Germany to demand a full explanation from Germany regarding the reported seizure of the U.S. ship City of Flint by a German warship. It is expected that the U.S. will request the Soviet government to release the ship, as it is understood that after the City of Flint arrived in Murmansk, the Soviet government impounded the ship on the grounds that, except under special circumstances, Germany had no right to escort a ship into a neutral port. Secretary of State Hull discussed the seizure of the City of Flint while hosting reporters, saying that more than half of the ship's cargo was conditionally contraband, and a small part was absolutely contraband. Hull was unwilling to say what action the U.S. government would take, but said that this incident clearly involved capture procedures. If so, this was consistently done by force. According to information received here, the U.S. crew and flag of the ship have been replaced by a German crew and flag. President Roosevelt also mentioned this matter when hosting reporters, saying that the U.S. government is still trying to inquire with the Soviet Union about the details of the ship's seizure, but has not yet received information on the ship's current location. President Roosevelt went on to answer reporters' questions, saying that, as far as ship seizure is concerned, all government ships do indeed have the same status as private ships. The U.S. Embassy in Moscow has reported here, stating that all the facts have not yet been fully ascertained. A reporter also asked President Roosevelt whether, under current laws, he had the power to order U.S. ships not to enter war zones. President Roosevelt replied "No," and said that he hoped to get the City of Flint back. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>London: According to Norwegian sources received here today, the ship that seized the U.S. ship City of Flint was the German cruiser Emden. It was previously heard that one or two armed German merchant ships were conducting raiding operations at sea, but it is only now known that there is a German warship on the high seas. It is understood that the Emden was built at the end of 1925, with a displacement of 5,400 tons and eight 6-inch guns. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington: The legal basis for the Soviet Union's detention of the U.S. ship City of Flint has now sparked lively discussions. It is expected that this matter may allow the Soviet Union to express its general attitude. U.S. Navy Department legal expert Axel said that if the Soviet Union does not openly stand on the German side, it will return the ship. Princeton University law professor Corwin said that if the Soviet Union remains neutral, the U.S. can file a protest and demand its release. However, if the Soviet Union indicates that it is one of the belligerents, then all ships carrying contraband into the Soviet Union will be subject to seizure by the Allied countries. Neutral ships captured in this environment can only enter neutral ports in the event of severe weather, damage to the ship, or lack of food. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>New York: Regarding the detention of the U.S. cargo ship "City of Flint" in the Soviet port of Murmansk, morning newspapers here all expressed dissatisfaction, but their tone was still moderate. The New York Times stated, "The navies of belligerent countries originally have the right to inspect neutral ships if they are carrying contraband. The U.S. government has no objections to this. However, if German warships order ships of other countries to sail to neutral ports for detention without ascertaining what they are carrying, then the U.S. government should consider this an illegal action. The State Department has already telegraphed the ambassadors stationed in Germany and the Soviet Union, requesting the governments of the countries where they are stationed to provide explanations. Once these ambassadors have replied, the Soviet Union's position on Germany will be clear." The Public Opinion Forum discussed this issue from a legal point of view, stating that the way this case is resolved may cause significant difficulties from a technical perspective. "This case contains explosives and must be reviewed calmly." (Havas Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>US Senate Approves Amendment to Neutrality Act: Eliminates Strict Shipping Restrictions, Except for the Dangerous Zone of the North Atlantic</h3>
<p>Washington - The Senate today approved an amendment to the government's Neutrality Act, removing stringent restrictions on American shipping, except for the dangerous zone of the North Atlantic. This amendment will allow American ships, excluding those carrying armaments, to transport any materials to belligerent ports in the South Atlantic, Pacific, Indian Ocean, China Sea, Tasman Sea, Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, Bermuda, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia. The Senate also passed an amendment allowing inland commerce with Canada and Mexico to continue as usual, without requiring purchasers to possess ownership certificates for goods before they cross the border. Furthermore, the Senate accepted a proposal to delete a clause in the bill that would have allowed belligerent nations to purchase goods on 90 days' credit. Democratic Senator Connally criticized the capture of the American ship Flint City, saying that the shipping restrictions in the bill could prevent the recurrence of such incidents, and the Senate should pay attention to this. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington - Today was the first day the Senate discussed the Neutrality Act amendment clause by clause. All important proposals put forward by senators advocating the abolition of the arms embargo were voted on and passed. The majority vote obtained was at least fifty out of ninety votes. Although the Senate unanimously passed a motion yesterday limiting speaking time to no more than forty-five minutes, today's discussion was so rapid that it was not necessary to implement this restriction. From this, it can be inferred that the government has won a victory. Congressional figures generally believe that the Senate can conclude the debate tomorrow or the day after. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Washington - In yesterday's meeting, the Senate verbally approved amendments to the administrative authorities' proposed amendments to the Neutrality Act, allowing American ships to sail in the Pacific Ocean and the Atlantic Ocean south of Bermuda. It is generally believed that this Neutrality Act amendment can be finalized on Friday or Saturday. Congressional leaders all believe that the House will take rapid action on this. Congress can close on November 10th. The amendment regarding ship navigation has been expanded, and American merchant ships can sail to Bermuda and, in special circumstances, to New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The House debate will begin on Monday. Fourteen isolationist members of Congress met in Johnson's office yesterday. Key figures among the isolationists, along with La Follette, said that the final vote on the Neutrality Act amendment could be held on Friday or Saturday. The isolationists admitted defeat on Monday but declared that they would make a final effort in the House debate. (Associated Press, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington - The United States Senate passed two amendments to the Neutrality Act at its meeting yesterday. These amendments were both proposed by Pittman, Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. (1) To allow American merchants to transport goods other than munitions to the ports of Bermuda, the South Atlantic, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Arabian Sea, and the Bay of Bengal. (2) To eliminate the provision in the Neutrality Act regarding the 90-day loan arrangement for belligerent countries purchasing goods from the United States. (Haitong, 25th)</p>
<p>Washington - Congressman Hamilton Fish declared today that he was confident that the capture of the American ship Flint City would reduce the number of votes in the House in favor of the arms embargo. The New York News also holds this view. It is said that this action is bound to have a strong reaction to the debate on the Neutrality Act. (Reuters, 25th)</p>

<h3>March of Europe at War (Continued) - Special Correspondence from London</h3>
<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>Yes, the one who just came upstairs was the old landlady here. Her intention was to ask me to go down to the basement level to avoid air raids. However, I am not going down.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I don't believe Hitler's planes can rush into the skies above London" - that was my reason.</p>
<p>She smiled reassuringly. However, after carefully inspecting my gas mask again, she stubbornly placed it beside my elbow and whispered, "Okay, do as you wish. However, when you hear the first sound of the anti-aircraft guns, please come down." Then, she turned and went downstairs... Lamentable old woman! These past few days, she has been bearing deep worry for her only son, who has been called into military service....</p>
<p>For more than a year, in order to cover up their own unique diplomatic path, British figures like Chamberlain invented a verbal syllogism: "If Britain strongly opposes aggression, then Hitler will find it difficult to expand further. - If he cannot expand, Germany will definitely provoke a major war, and Britain will definitely be drawn into it. - However, Britain's preparations are not complete, so the current task is preparation; and diplomatically, we can only continue to make concessions to Germany."</p>
<p>"Preparation"! "Preparation"! And still "Preparation"! - This slogan covered up all the ugliness.</p>
<p>For more than a year, everyone's ears have almost developed calluses from hearing it; but, just last week, we still heard an important figure from Chamberlain's faction saying the same thing. However, a week later today, Britain declared war on Germany. What is the state of Britain's preparations after all? Everyone is concerned about this.</p>
<p>The aspect of pure military combat, let's not talk about that here. Let's briefly look at other aspects of Britain's preparations.</p>
<p>Isn't it said that the German air force's bombing of the rear is the most terrible? And, isn't it also said that Britain's air defense is inadequate? Apart from anti-aircraft guns, it is said that there is also a lack of anti-aircraft balloons.</p>
<p>However, now, just taking London as an example, there are more than eighteen thousand such balloons! More than two years ago, I was in the country, had been to both the north and south war zones, and had also stayed in Nanjing, which was bombed every day, but I never saw such balloons. But China fought the enemy in the same way. Now here, on this very first day of the declaration of war, I am able to gaze upon eighteen thousand such monsters in London. - This is a kind of silver-gray monster, each as big as a building, rising into the air, floating and floating. In dense places, looking at it suddenly, it looks like a pond full of lotus leaves.</p>
<p>Yes, and the most terrible thing is the enemy's poison gas. Therefore, the British authorities have universally issued a gas mask to everyone living on these three islands. Now, there are a total of forty-five million residents and foreigners living in the entire United Kingdom; however, Britain has prepared fifty-one million gas masks! In addition to everyone having already received one, there are still six million left, piled up in storage, as reserves. And Germany, which is known for having the most developed air force, her citizens do not have this good fortune of receiving a gas mask free of charge for each person. Germany's gas masks are mainly for export, to exchange for foreign exchange and raw materials. Not long ago, I heard that someone here was selling German-made gas masks, each priced at two pounds, twelve shillings, and sixpence. But its quality is not better than the British ones that are distributed for free, so the result is, naturally, no one cares.</p>
<p>For wartime service, the stretch bearer teams, fire brigades, ambulance teams, ...etc., that have already been registered nationwide in Britain, excluding the original, those still in service, the number of volunteers who have been temporarily called up alone, men and women combined, has already exceeded two million! In the near future, there will be another supplementary three hundred and fifty thousand people.</p>
<p>Also, food is a big problem. However, in European countries, most of which have declared food rationing systems, Britain has not yet adopted rationing. According to general estimates, for the past two or three years, the British Ministry of the Interior has been constantly stockpiling food. Even if Britain does not import any food from this point on, everything that is available can at least last for two or three years. Moreover, on the sea, there is a large fleet of merchant ships protected by its invincible navy. So, there is a very strange phenomenon here: two months ago, when the European situation was tense, you could see groups of women shopping for food, preparing to store it; but now that the war has really broken out, the phenomenon of storing food has disappeared.</p>
<p>The organization and capacity of Britain's transportation is also commendable. Just taking London as an example, three days ago, the British government began the evacuation of London residents. Within these three days, one and a half million people have been moved out of London by the government! Adding in those who moved out on their own, the number is at least three million. However, what attracts our attention is that there has been no congestion or disorder on the transportation lines. (3:30 AM, September 3rd)</p>
<p>(Note added on the morning of September 4th: Now I know that the air raid alarm last night was for a drill, not because enemy planes were actually coming. The official announcement of the results of this test was that it was "quite satisfactory." (End)</p>
<h3>Opium and Gambling Flourish in Suzhou: The People Suffer from the Policy of Poisoning</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Since the fall of this county two years ago, the social situation has reached an extreme state of disorder. The puppet organization has recently catered to the wishes of the Japanese side and implemented a policy of poisoning, opening a pseudo-local opium prohibition bureau to openly sell opium. The affairs of the prohibition bureau are presided over by Yang Qin-cheng. Branch bureaus in various townships are ordered by the local police to force people to obtain licenses to smoke opium. It is learned that the number of opium smokers in the county has exceeded 10,000. There are thirty-seven Class A opium dens, more than two hundred and fifty Class B, and over five hundred Class C. Compared with before the war, the number of opium smokers and opium dens has increased more than tenfold. Regarding gambling, there were thirty-one gambling houses in the urban area last autumn. Recently, the Japanese military police have notified the owners of various gambling houses, ordering them to obtain licenses and officially gamble openly. As a result, smaller gambling houses have closed down due to operating expenses. Currently, only the gambling houses near Guanqian, the North Bureau, and in the Shilu area of Changmen remain. It is said that more than ten thousand people go in and out every day.</p>

<h3>The Crucial Issues and Improvement Methods of Relief and Education for Refugee Children (3)</h3>
<p>— Qian Yonghe</p>
<p>(II) Education and Nurturing</p>
<p>(1) Subsistence expenses: The greatest need for relief of refugee children is living expenses. The minimum standard is a food cost of one dime per child per day. If 30,000 refugee children are rescued from the war zone, the food cost for one day is 3,000 yuan, totaling 90,000 yuan per month. When they arrive at orphanages, teaching centers, or nursery homes, they must be equipped with clothing, trousers, shoes, socks, bedding, tents, mats, and cushions for all four seasons, costing 30 yuan per child, totaling 900,000 yuan for 30,000 people. Medical expenses and various equipment in the institution, and the salaries of teachers and staff, are not included. On average, each child needs to spend 40 yuan on all supplies when admitted to the institution, and the monthly regular education and nurturing expenses are 10 yuan. With 30,000 children, 4.8 million yuan will be spent in one year. Afterwards, as the war zone expands, refugee relief groups will take in more refugee children, and the expenses will be even more extensive. This large amount of subsistence expenses must be subsidized by the government as much as possible, and the generous donations of enthusiastic people at home and abroad can be maintained. However, in fact, in cities with a higher standard of living, one dime per child per day is not enough for food. Initially, the refugee children admitted had particularly many diseases, and medical expenses averaged 5 dimes per child per month. Due to economic difficulties, some orphanages, teaching centers, or nursery homes had to reduce the three meals a day to two, or even just one bowl of porridge and one bowl of rice, leaving children in their teens who are growing and developing half-starved and lacking nutrition, leading to yellow skin and thinness. Furthermore, due to the meager treatment of teachers and staff, the institution had to provide food and drink, and as a result, the food of the teachers, staff, and workers was still included in the food cost of 3 yuan per child per month. In institutions with fewer than one hundred children, each child only received 2 yuan worth of meals per month. If food management is done well, it can be barely maintained. Although it is a year of good harvests and rice is cheap, the price of firewood, charcoal, and kerosene has skyrocketed several times, and the cost of living in cities has further increased. Winter is approaching, and a large number of winter clothing and quilts need to be added, and a set of clothing and bedding for each child costs 20 yuan, costing 600,000 yuan for 30,000 children. The recent surge in the number of refugee children rescued from bombings in various places has not yet been included. Therefore, the government and society must find more ways to raise funds for the subsistence expenses of refugee children.</p>
<p>(2) Disease Treatment: Refugee children who have escaped from the war zone have experienced many hardships, exposed to the elements, and lived in dirty environments, so most of them are sick. Scabies, mange, and trachoma, these common diseases, are suffered by almost 80-90% of them. Stomach diseases, lung diseases, and syphilis are also not uncommon. The first thing to do when refugee children are sent to orphanages, teaching centers, or nursery homes is to bathe, change clothes, shave their heads, scrape their eyes, and examine their bodies. Some diseases can be cured by the doctor's instructions and simple nursing care, with the assistance of teachers and staff. Some diseases must be sent to the hospital. Therefore, medical expenses are also an important part of refugee relief. The most difficult thing is that there are too many sick children, and there are too few doctors, nurses, and medicines. This problem is even more serious in inland institutions. Sometimes even gauze and cotton are lacking. In summer, without mosquito nets, refugee children are bitten by mosquitoes and black insects. In autumn, malaria is prevalent, and poisonous sores cover the body. There are even cases where all the children in the institution are sick, and death is inevitable. Treatment also takes time. The mental suffering of refugee children who are separated from their parents and suffer from illness can be imagined. The illness before admission is unavoidable, and the illness after admission is partly due to poor management. For example, children's food is not nutritious enough, and often each child eats seven or eight bowls of rice, causing the stomach capacity to expand and reduce elasticity, leading to stomach diseases. Insufficient beds and bedding, two children share a quilt, children with scabies, children with trachoma, or children with scabies sleep together, resulting in one child contracting two or three diseases. In addition, the clothes of sick children are not separated clearly, not disinfected, and not washed, and most sick children cannot be absolutely isolated, and they are repeatedly infected, becoming a common phenomenon. The benevolent intention of rescuing refugee children has led to facts that harm refugee children, which are also heard from time to time. Some institutions borrow temples and ancestral halls, which have few windows and are very humid. Refugee children often lie on the floor, and in summer, the humidity is high, and athlete's foot is difficult to treat. In winter, due to the lack of winter clothing and quilts, frostbite has also become a popular disease. Throughout the year, refugee children suffer from rotating illnesses, or even all illnesses. Therefore, the treatment of refugee children's diseases is a most serious problem.</p>

<h3>Prominent Philadelphians Propose Holding the Pan American Games Next Year to Replace the World Games, and Intend to Invite Non-Participating Countries to Join</h3>
<p>(Philadelphia, 11th Air Mail) Prominent social leaders here have initiated the holding of a Pan American Games here next year to replace the Olympic Games originally scheduled to be held in the Finnish capital next year, which may be cancelled due to the war. This matter has been quite certain. Acting Mayor George Connell suggested that the leaders of various sports organizations should be responsible for drafting this matter.</p>

If this matter is realized, China's dispatch of athletes is worthy of special attention. However, a concrete decision will have to wait until Dr. Wang Zhengting arrives in Hong Kong from Chongqing.</p>

<h3>Finance: Buying Sentiment Increases, Foreign Exchange Rebounds and Tightens, Sassoon Continues to Absorb, Hong Kong Settles Forward Contracts</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no changes in the HSBC listed rates. In the off-exchange market for British and American currencies, the trend was a rebound and softening due to excessive loosening the previous day, fluctuating around the five-office mark, which was within expectations. This was because no major players were heard to have entered the market in the past two days, and most suppliers are now raising prices, so the available funds are not sufficient. Yesterday, due to only half a day of trading on Wednesday, the market initially opened tight at 0.3125 and 0.0625, with British gold at four offices and 9375, and the US dollar at eight yuan and 25. Subsequently, Sassoon continued to push up the price, and it was reported that foreign firms and Chinese merchants were also buying in, and Hong Kong Electric was buying forward contracts, which led to an expansion of buying sentiment. It softened again to four shillings and 875, and the US dollar to eight yuan and 125. However, the buying and selling suddenly became moderate, and it once showed a slight firming, but ultimately, due to Yuli and the Japanese banks entering the market to search for funds, the price tightened again, with British gold quoted at seven-eight-one-two-five shillings, and the US dollar also breaking into the eight-yuan mark, softening to seven yuan and 9375. At the close of trading, the tightest price for British gold was four shillings and seven-eight-one-two-five offices, tighter by one-eight-seven-five than the previous day, and the US dollar was eight yuan, softer by three-one-two-five than the previous day. British currency was tighter than the US dollar, which was because the US and British mutual exchange rates had risen for two consecutive days. It was heard that there were futures transactions, and the situation was the same as in the spot market, with half-day trading still brisk.</p>
<p>US Dollar Once Reached the Eight Yuan Mark</p>
<p>Early in the morning, London's long-term bill increased by 5 points, and the forward rate increased by 375 points. New York silver prices rose by 375 points. London's raw gold remained stable. The exchange rates for British, American, and French currencies were flat, while the exchange rate against Shanghai decreased by 125 points. The US dollar rose by 625 points against the British pound, increased by a tenth of a yuan against Shanghai, and increased by 25 points against the French franc. The central bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. The bank's opening selling price for spot goods in the morning was four shillings and 9375 for British gold and eight yuan and 25 for the US dollar. Compared to the previous close, the British pound was tighter by 0.3125 and the US dollar was softer by 0.0625. After the opening, Sassoon came back to push up settlements, and Hong Kong Electric suddenly bought US dollar futures for November at eight yuan. It was also heard that Chinese merchants and foreign firms were also following suit, leading to a continued trend towards expansion. Sassoon bought spot British gold at four shillings, 90625, and 875 from Dutch McCalee, followed by foreign firms settling spot US dollars at eight yuan, 1875, and 125. At that time, Hong Kong Electric bought November US dollars from a certain bank at eight yuan. HSBC's listed rates were announced as unchanged, and the silver balance tax was announced as one and a half cents higher. Afterwards, the buying sentiment slightly subsided and briefly turned flat. It was heard that foreign firms had traded spot British gold at four shillings, 90625. At the same time, spot US dollars also rebounded to eight yuan, 1875. Subsequently, Yinhang Youli suddenly absorbed funds on behalf of a certain party, and Japanese banks also followed suit, so the situation tightened and softened again. Yuli and the Japanese banks bought spot British gold at four shillings, 84375, and 78125, and spot US dollars tightened from eight yuan, 125, to seven yuan, 9375. The situation slightly stabilized at noon. Extending to the noon close, the bank's selling price for spot goods was four shillings, 78125 for British gold and eight yuan for the US dollar. The rates for the current month were the same as for spot goods. The rates for November were four shillings, 734375 for British gold and seven yuan, 90625 for the US dollar. As a result, British currency was tighter than the US dollar. The spot and forward British currency were both tighter by 1875, while the US currency was softer by 3125. There was no market in the afternoon due to Wednesday being a half-day.</p>

<h3>Gold Market Rises</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Merchants' Appetite is Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot raw gold black market situation saw a sudden rise after six days of sharp decline. However, people's hearts were still lacking in stimulation, and the overall situation shifted with the loosening of the exchange rate market. The morning opening was 3,820 yuan, which was 55 yuan higher than yesterday, due to the tightening of the exchange rate, and sellers temporarily took a wait-and-see attitude. However, after hearing that the exchange rate market had stabilized, money changers and gold shops came out to buy with little strength, and the price once fell to 3,760 yuan. But ultimately, due to the tightness of the exchange rate market, gold shops turned to buying, and securities firms also came to search for goods, and the price rose to 3,855 yuan. Although gold shops came out again in the middle and slightly retraced, by the time of the noon close, it was 3,835 yuan. The afternoon opening price was comparable to the morning close. Later, because the pushers were not as enthusiastic as in the morning, and the Hong Kong merchants' appetite was also small, it fell back to 3,800 yuan. However, the closing price rose again to 3,822 yuan, a rebound of 57 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was still brisk, with more than 2,000 taels traded. Silver jewelry also rose by 5 yuan. Customs gold and others remained flat.</p>
<p>Raw Gold Rebounded 57 Yuan</p>
<p>From the initial opening of each bar (ten taels) in the morning, due to the tightening of the foreign exchange, buying sentiment was stimulated. Securities firms first raised prices, and sellers took the opportunity to raise prices. The market opened with a jump of 55 yuan. Securities firms entered 30 taels with money changers at 3,820 yuan. After the opening, jewelry shops and money changers suddenly came to frantically sell, and because the foreign exchange situation stabilized, the entering forces were weak and immediately retreated into the 3,800 yuan range. Money changers traded 20 taels mutually at 3,760 yuan. Subsequently, due to a certain order number pulling up, it rose by 40 yuan in an instant. Money changers entered 20 taels with gold shops at 3,800 yuan. After this, another gold shop came out on behalf of a large household, and then retreated to 3,760 yuan. Then, a certain gold shop continued to buy on behalf of speculators, and securities firms came to search for goods again, coupled with the softening of the foreign exchange, resulting in a surge of 95 yuan. A certain gold shop entered 30 taels with money changers, priced at 3,855 yuan. Near noon, a certain gold shop suddenly profited and came out again, and money changers also followed suit and sold. Soon after, it fell back by 30 yuan. Money changers sold 50 taels to gold shops, priced at 3,825 yuan. Later, a certain silver building entered 20 taels with money changers, with a noon closing price of 3,835 yuan. The initial opening in the afternoon was still stable. First, a certain silver building entered 50 taels with money changers, priced at 3,835 yuan. After that, although a certain silver building continued to purchase on behalf of Hong Kong merchants, the amount was limited, and a certain gold shop and retail investors had a strong selling atmosphere, which actually shrank by 35 yuan. Gold shops traded 30 taels mutually, priced at 3,800 yuan. After entering, a certain money changer took advantage of the low price to absorb funds, and Hong Kong merchants came back to activity, which pulled up by 25 yuan. Money changers bought 20 taels from order numbers at 3,820 yuan. Then, money changers traded 30 taels mutually, with a closing price of 3,822 yuan. As a result, it rebounded by 575 compared to the previous day, with a total of 95 yuan in ups and downs. The selling price of the current cash gold number's brand gold is 10 yuan higher than raw gold, and the purchase price must be reduced by more than 20 yuan. The current standard gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, but there were few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Listed at 5 Yuan Higher</p>
<p>The initial price for silver jewelry sold by each tael of Dahonghang was still $380. At 11:15 AM, the price was listed 5 yuan higher. After that, there were no further changes. Dahonghang changed the listed price to $385. Xinhonghang's price was the same as the above price, and the purchase price must be reduced by 15 yuan to 20 yuan, or more.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Turn Firm</h3>
<p>British and American Gold Pounds Rise by One Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign currency market saw a decrease in the supply of British and American gold pounds, and the market was firm. Customers were eager to absorb British and American gold bills, and the price rose significantly. Hong Kong bills followed suit and became expensive due to the firming of the Hong Kong exchange rate. The demand for French franc bills and Annam bills increased, and the price also rose. Philippine bills and Australian gold bills also rose with British and American gold bills. The market for Japanese gold bills was slightly firm, with an evening price of one yuan, three cents, and two and a half mills. The demand for Korean bills increased slightly, and the market was slightly firm, with an evening price of one yuan and nine and a half mills. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds rise by one yuan each, British gold bills rise by one yuan and two corners, American gold bills rise by four corners, Hong Kong bills rise by six points, French franc bills rise by one point, Dutch bills rise by two corners, Annam bills and Philippine bills rise by one corner each, Robbie bills rise by five points, Australian gold bills rise by five corners, and other currencies remain unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities Market Stagnant</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market trend for securities turned soft again. On the surface, it fell by five to six corners, but it was actually similar to the closing price of the previous day, without much difference. It can be said that it was a large rise followed by a small retreat. Fundamentally, people's hearts are still stable, and there is no special pattern. When type C fell to eight and a half yuan, buyers were extremely enthusiastic, and the mentality of buying low had deeply affected the industry, creating a situation where it was easy to rise and difficult to fall. As the foreign exchange tightened slightly and gold rebounded, the multi-party's aggressive intentions were slightly relaxed. The news was dull, the rumors temporarily subsided, and the dynamics of the various factions gradually became calm. However, changes in the situation in the near future are said to have significant progress, so more and more people are paying attention to the government bond market, and there will be greater changes in the future. Yesterday's situation saw the morning start weak and then firm, with frequent entries and exits by various factions. Shengda Hongkang and others bought in, with the 20th being the most enthusiastic to absorb at a low price. Tongkang Tiansheng and No. 40 both sold, with Changji selling the most. The noon close was down five to six corners. The afternoon situation stabilized, and the various factions did little business. Although Changji continued to sell, the market price was quite firm. The market price resulted in a retreat of three and a half to six and a half corners, with only No. 96 being good by one and a half corners. The total turnover was about one million yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Unified A | 58.70 | 58.60 | 58.60 | Down 0.60</p>
<p>Unified B | 50.60 | 50.25 | 50.60 | Down 0.35</p>

<p>Stock trading saw 50 shares of Huacheng Tobacco Company stock traded at a price of 29 yuan and 5 corners, it is said.</p>
<p>The stock market at the Public Assembly of Various Industries was slightly stagnant yesterday, probably because trading was only for half a day, so prices were roughly the same as before.</p>
<p>London, 24th Dispatch. Today's listed exchange rates for Chinese foreign debt remain calm. There were no changes in various government bonds, whether up or down. London, 24th Dispatch.

<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Yarn Prices Rise Again, Both Double-Horse and Double-Earth Jump by Over 30 Yuan Each</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been falling sharply every day, rebounded yesterday, and the rise was both violent and drastic. This kind of rebound and rise was also within reason. At the same time, the foreign exchange changed to shrink, and Hong Kong merchants had a slightly healthier appetite due to the cheap price, revealing a little vitality. The general snatchers competed to scoop up in the market, and the market tightened, the buying atmosphere was extremely strong, and the market price rose step by step. Market transactions, including the nature of winning and losing for the same industry, accounted for more than 70% of the transactions, entering and exiting from time to time. The future tea foundation is not consolidated. We must cultivate and plant it through actual sales. We will find it difficult to exist in the midst of turbulence and uncertainty. Because the bottom has seen an increase, relying solely on the pull-up of hoarders and speculators is not a fundamental problem.</p>
<p>The opening price of the current yarn in the morning was solid due to the lingering style of the previous day. The opening price was still flat. Soon after, it was heard that the foreign exchange had suddenly shrunk, and the popularity immediately stirred up. Speculators rose up again, the buying atmosphere suddenly ignited, the shouting was loud, and the market price rose step by step. The spot price of 20s Double Horse rose from 626 yuan all the way to 656 yuan at the close of trading. The price increase of other brands was more moderate. According to the half-day transaction statistics, there were 2,030 packages traded. The market price of 10s Double Horse rose by 34 yuan, Tiannv rose by 34 yuan, and Double Earth rose by 36 yuan. The factory of Yong'an Factory opened 400 packages of 20s Special Jincheng, priced at 650 yuan to 660 yuan. It was found that there were four pieces of cotton yarn being shipped to Hong Kong today (26th), and 350 pieces being shipped to Ningbo. The amount of each party's purchases is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Same Industry 1,360 Ningbo 110</p>
<p>Hong Kong 41 Mainland 150</p>
<p>Total 2,030</p>
<p>The Yarn Industry Association will move to the second floor of the eastern part of the New World Building at the Racecourse on Daimalu starting from next month, which is November 1st, and will conduct business meetings as usual. The original location has expired.</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Falls to 120 Yuan</h3>
<p>The trading of the same cotton industry has become more lively, but the factory side is still waiting and watching the purchasing mind because the yarn price fluctuates. All transactions are buying and selling in the cotton number. The price of raw cotton Huoji Flower fell by one or two yuan. As for the Tongzhou Flower with superior quality, the selling price is still flat, but the goods with inferior silk and wool are still loose. It was found that 975 packages of Tong Flower came from Subei, 1,348 packages came from Changyinsha, and 454 packages came from Beisha. The current cotton selling dishes are listed on the left (banknote stack delivery):</p>
<p>Huoji Flower 120.00 Same Industry 200 Packages</p>
<p>Again 121.00 Again 150 Packages</p>
<p>Brazilian Cotton 183.00 Again 60 Pieces</p>
<p>Again 176.50 Again 100 Pieces</p>
<p>Tongzhou Flower 127.50 Again 240 Packages</p>
<p>Again 126.50 Again 400 Packages</p>
<p>Huoji Flower 121.00 23.00 Again 1,000 Packages</p>
<p>Tongzhou Morning 130.00 Again 120 Packages</p>
<p>Another message: The transaction of Shanghai's foreign cotton has been sluggish recently due to the sharp release of exchange rates, and the yarn price has plummeted. The same industry is holding a wait-and-see attitude. The factory side has been closed for a long time. Those in the same industry who have hand goods have suffered losses due to the impact of the exchange rate. Although the exchange rate has turned tight yesterday, the cotton price has not been able to rise, so all parties' minds are unusually indifferent. Cotton merchants believe that the rise and fall of the cotton price depends entirely on cotton yarn, but yarn merchants say that it must be determined by the rise and fall of the cotton price. But in fact, the rise and fall of commodity prices depends entirely on the level of the exchange rate.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: New York cotton market was firm in the early morning, and the market was very outstanding due to the purchase of speculators and the prosperity of spot transactions. The Liverpool telegram was good, so there were many transactions in the same industry. As a result, the closing price rose by four or five pounds compared to the previous day. India was flat, Egypt rose by more than ten pounds, and Liverpool rose by four pounds.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Sources are Smoother</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sources from various gangs: Hexia had no arrivals. Chelun Baozi arrived at more than 4,000 packages. The arrival was huge, and the market had softened yesterday, so the early market started, people's hearts were frivolous, and the Hakka selling heart was loose. Later, the two local stomachs were also flat, and the situation became more loose, and the market could hardly stand firm. As a result, the number of transactions in the city was only five or six thousand packages, and the prices of new japonica rice and kiln-grown Baige, etc., fell by half a yuan to nearly one yuan compared with the previous market. The remaining broken japonica, Yuan and Luyang Jiankejian fell by about half a yuan. The closing market price of Changxi Gaoxin japonica rice was 31 yuan, 120 yuan and 5 cents, and the second was 26 to 27 yuan. The market broken japonica was 30 yuan to 289 yuan, 26 to 27 yuan. Sutung Kunchang new japonica was 29 and a half yuan, 29 yuan, and the second was 26 yuan, broken 25 to 26 yuan, Qingjiao Kiln seed 30 yuan and 5 cents, wild rice 31 yuan, 30 yuan and 5 cents, Fengjia Baige 29 yuan, and the second was 27 and a half yuan, Songjiang second Baige 26 and a half yuan, thin broken 26 yuan, Nangang white rice 29 yuan, early broken 25 yuan, 23 yuan and 23 cents for special sheep tips, 20 yuan and 8 cents for the end, 24 yuan for special Lu tips, 22 yuan and a half for the end, and Jiangbei tips have been difficult to communicate with the market price in the producing area and the problem of shipping obstacles, so there have been no arrivals for a long time. The market is only receiving a limited amount of old deposits, so even though Wujian has fallen between the falls, most cargo owners are unwilling to get rid of it lightly and insist on trying their best. At the same time, sales are welcomed and managed, so the closing price is slightly affected by Wujian and is slightly criticized by two or three cents, doing 19 yuan, seven corners and 19 and a half yuan, and its Nanjing No. 1 is open at 19 yuan and eight corners, No. 2 is 19 yuan and three corners, Zaihao is 18 yuan and eight corners, Wuhu Dujian is 19 yuan and eight corners, and it ends at sharp 18 yuan, Chen Bianyuan 30 yuan, 29 yuan, and Xin Yuan 26 and a half yuan to 25 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday's market for Ke Xian was sold in detail, and the market continued to fall. In addition to the small number of arrivals from Jiangbei, the area of Jingwu continued to arrive in whole batches. It is said that the price of Wuhu has been reduced, and the price of Changdi machine rice has been reduced to 11 yuan. It seems that the source will not be reduced in the future. Although Dongxing lacks wholesale spitting out, there are still small sales in retail, and the stock of rice in this city is increasing, people's hearts are softening, and the market price has been cut by three to five cents. The total market transaction is less than 3,000 packages.</p>
<h3>Artillery Car Powder: The Customer Plate Opens at 7 and a Half Yuan</h3>
<p>Flour: The spot flour was as stable as usual yesterday. Sales to customers from the north and south oceans can be described as consecutive. There are sporadic additions in Tianjin and Hong Kong and Xiamen, but the number is not strong. The factory is also unwilling to supply as much as possible. The wholesale price of No. 2 flour is still 7 yuan and 3 cents. The customer plates such as the Bingchuan Tianzhu and other powders are 7 yuan and 4 corners, and the Artillery Car brand has been opened at 7 yuan and 5 corners. The market is still stable, and the total market transaction is 40,000 packages.</p>
<p>Wheat: There were not many sources yesterday, and sales were not strong. Because the foreign exchange was lengthened the day before and the gold market plummeted, the ocean wheat orders may be close, so the factory took advantage of this opportunity to choose cleverly, and the cargo party was still unwilling to accommodate too much because of the high cost. As a result, the market continued to rise by one or two corners. The total market was 800 packages of Jiangbei and Suzhou wheat imported by Fuxin Factory, priced at 10 yuan, 6 cents to 4 cents and a half. The Guohu purchased 14 vehicles of Changzhou and Kunshan wheat, priced at 10 yuan, 8 cents and 3 cents to 6 cents.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Raw Soybean Oil: Arrivals Connect: Market Dips</h3>
<p>Yesterday's raw soybean oil market generally turned down, mainly because the sources were connected, and the gangs were not greedy, so people's hearts were set, and the market was lazy. Peanut oil fell by one and a half yuan, and soybean oil fell by half a yuan to one yuan. A total of 200 pieces of Jiaozhou raw oil were opened, priced at 58 yuan, and 750 cans of Jiangbei canned raw oil were opened, priced at 73 yuan, all of which were taken by Hong Kong. The street only sold 25 barrels of Dalian soybean oil, priced at 68 yuan, 50 pieces of Yanqi soybean oil, 50 yuan and 5 cents, 100 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil, 50 yuan, and 100 cans of Jiangbei canned soybean oil, 64 yuan and 5 cents.</p>
<p>Today, 230 packages of beans were shipped to Hong Kong, 300 packages were shipped to Singapore, and 3,200 pieces of bean cake were shipped to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Bai Factory Jing Suddenly Drops by 400 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign silk market: Japanese and American silk prices both rose and fell. New York's recent fall was one corner and five mills, and the forward rose by one cent. Yokohama's spot fell by 10 yuan, and the forward fell by 35 yuan. Foreign firms stopped entering their stomachs. The eating price of 70-80% of Bai Factory was 4,300 yuan, which was a huge drop of 400 yuan compared to the 4,700 yuan last week. But at present, Shanghai's silk stock is thin, and most of the raw materials are still detained in Hongkou, so manufacturers have limited hand goods and are unwilling to accommodate. Yesterday, there were few transactions in Bai Factory Jili, and there were no imports or exports in Yinzhuang.</p>
<p>Today (26th), 10 pieces of tea leaves were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Transactions Resume</h3>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>The recent decline of cotton cloth has been too fierce. The same industry and scattered hoarders have successively disposed of their goods. Compared with the beginning of this month, the market has been reduced by 4 yuan per piece of 10-pound coarse cloth, and fine twill and fine cloth also need 3 or 4 yuan. Yesterday, the yarn market rebounded, and people's hearts looked bullish. The street started to purchase, and the transaction suddenly became strong. The selling dishes in the morning market were still varied. In the afternoon, all the coarse cloth, fine cloth and twill were increased by one corner to two and a half corners per piece, and the colored cloth, colored twill and bleached cloth were increased by two and a half corners to five corners per piece. This street replenished empty positions and thoughts. The transaction of coarse cloth, fine cloth and fine twill was more than 500 pieces. The Yue gang handled more than 3,000 pieces of coarse cloth, flannel and silk. Subei Xinghua and other places handled thousands of pieces of colored cloth, straight tribute bigu. The Min gang handled more than 2,000 pieces of colored twill, colored cloth and bigu. The Sihanoukville and Xiao Luzon handled thousands of pieces of colored cloth and printed cloth for foreign countries. The Ning gang purchased a lot of stored goods for shipment.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of yarn rebounded, and white and colored goods turned better. The morning and afternoon markets rose in a straight line. The price of 12-pound Longtou fine cloth rose from 18 yuan and 4 corners per piece to 19 yuan and 2 corners and a half. The price of Sijunzi Yuan Bigu rose from 6 corners and 2 cents and a half per yard to 6 corners and 3 cents. This street's new national households and the same industry are very enthusiastic to replenish empty positions. The transaction of fine cloth and fine twill reached more than 1,000 pieces. The trade this month's Longtou fine cloth opened 19 yuan and 5 corners, and the market was very strong.</p>
<p>Export</p>

<h3>Sugar Market: Although the Price of Foreign Sugar is Flat, the Shanghai Market is Still Good; There is a Saying that Chao Sugar will Increase Taxes</h3>
<p>According to the Dutch telegram, the market price of gross white sugar just loaded is slightly flat, at 11.25 Dutch guilders, but the foreign exchange has shrunk, so the market price of the Guild Hall has also turned better. Spot 24 gross white sugar has risen by two to three yuan, the original shop is 55 yuan, and the outside shop is 55 yuan to 55 yuan and a half. Transshipment goods have risen by one and a half yuan to three yuan, to 42 yuan and a half.

<h3>Market Conditions Summary</h3>
<p>Chen Glutinous Rice Branch Sees Rise: New glutinous rice branches are short of arrivals, but it has been found that there are about 70 boxes of Chen goods.

<h3>Beef Juice: Truly a Great Tonic  Gu Mingdao</h3>
<p>Those who use their brains extensively are generally weak and prone to illness. Therefore, it is essential to take tonics during the winter to strengthen their foundation and bodies. However, tonics like ginseng and deer velvet are either expensive or too rich. Although there are many imported products, they also have the drawback of focusing on one aspect while neglecting others. Furthermore, medications are used to correct imbalances and are not the ideal, regular tonic. Hence, there is a saying: "Food tonics are better than medicinal tonics." Among food tonics, besides eggs, beef has the greatest nourishing power. The "Compendium of Materia Medica" states that beef is sweet, warm, belongs to earth, calms the middle, strengthens the spleen, benefits qi, and quenches thirst. Scientific analysis reveals that it contains elements such as phosphorus, protein, and enzymes. Therefore, Westerners especially enjoy eating it. In the past, Chinese people often avoided it, believing it was difficult to digest, but now it is also considered a good dish. However, for weak individuals seeking ample nourishment, nothing is better than drinking its juice. It is highly effective, easily digestible, and truly has a hundred benefits without a single drawback. However, making it oneself daily can be troublesome and uneconomical. Now, Yuansha Company's beef juice is fresh, highly nourishing, and has been sterilized. Daily delivery is arranged with various conveniences for subscribers. Compared to crudely made, substandard products, it is on a different level altogether. It is truly a great and timely tonic for strengthening the body in winter.</p>
<h3>Recommended Tonic Zhao Junhao</h3>
<p>Several years ago, due to excessive use of my brain, I often felt mentally inadequate. Friends and relatives advised me to take tonics, but I was unsure which tonic would be most suitable. Then, a Western friend mentioned the effectiveness of beef juice, which piqued my interest. However, the price of generally foreign-made beef juice was too high, making long-term consumption uneconomical. So, I switched to Yuansha Company's fresh beef juice and found that it not only tasted delicious but also had a nourishing power that was absolutely no less than that of imported products. Occasionally, I also took young chicken juice, which had even more remarkable effects. After taking it continuously for one or two months, both my physical and mental strength improved significantly. It is convenient to take, and the price is fair. It can be considered the best of the best among modern tonics. Therefore, at the end of this book, I am writing a short article to promote it! (Excerpted from Zhao Jun's "The Newspaper Industry in China")</p>
<h3>A Child Without Illness All Year Round Qin Shouou</h3>
<p>My neighbor, Mr. Zou, is my old classmate and colleague. We have been neighbors on Avenue Foch for at least four or five years, so I know everything about him and his family very well. Even if I were to record everything like my "Leng Ziyu Narrating the Ningguo Prefecture," it would not be a problem. However, firstly, it might not be very interesting, and secondly, it seems too far from the scope of this article.</p>
<p>Now, let's just talk about his family of five. In addition to him and his wife, the other three are their sons. Mr. Zou is not yet forty years old and has raised three boys in one go, which is truly fortunate in the eyes of those who "struggle to have children." However, he certainly suffered for these three children three years ago! Because he is a refined, mentally exhausting person, and his wife only has "bone structure" and no "flesh," both husband and wife are very thin. Therefore, their sons were all "skin and bones," constantly catching colds and coughs, seeking medical attention, and even suffering from serious illnesses, causing chaos at home and unrest for the family. The couple often did not smile for a week, talking only about their three children's illnesses.</p>
<p>He had also noticed the famous saying "prevention is better than cure" and wanted to give his sons some nourishing food to strengthen their bodies and ward off illnesses. Initially, he listened to the Western doctors who had eaten Flag Brand bread and filtered water for many years and completely treated Chinese people as foreigners. He had his three children drink milk and cod liver oil regularly. Unfortunately, the milk was too rich and oily, and the cod liver oil was too fishy. After eating it for two or three months, the children's bodies did not improve, and their appetites worsened instead. Mr. Zou became anxious and sought Chinese medicine, switching to eating white fungus and bird's nest. After eating it for more than half a year, the amount of money spent was not small, but the effect was not seen at all. When he asked the old doctors, they all said that this was a "royal road" tonic, with long-term benefits but no immediate effects. When he asked when the long-term benefits would be seen, the old doctors could not say. Later, Mr. Zou almost gave ginseng to his children, but he thought it was not good after all, as he seemed to have never heard of children aged seven or eight or four or five eating ginseng in his thirty-plus years of life. So, he could only frown and sulk all day and night.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, one winter, I was subscribing to Yuansha Company's young chicken juice, and he chatted with me, planning to order three portions to try. Because I knew that his finances were not very affluent, I advised him to order three portions of beef juice first and let the children try it for a month. Unexpectedly, more than twenty days later, the three children, who originally had faces as yellow as withered wax, actually showed some redness. The second child, who used to wet the bed every night, also stopped doing so from then on. Mr. Zou was so happy that he let his three little brothers eat fresh beef juice throughout the winter. By the second year, Mrs. Zou's spirits were also much better. According to her, the three children averaged only one minor illness every three months, no longer as frail as before. So, they subscribed every year, almost without interruption except for the three or four months of summer. Until now, these three young Mr. Zous have become children without illness all year round.</p>
<p>The purpose of my writing this article is not purely to promote Yuansha Company. The main purpose is to tell everyone: Choosing tonics is really not an easy task!</p>
<h3>Equivalent to a "Fox-lined Robe" Dai</h3>
<p>My cousin, Zhu Lianjun, is physically weak and afraid of the cold. In severe winter, he cannot keep warm without heavy fur clothing, which not only makes his movements clumsy but also makes work inconvenient. During the escape, he only had a lined jacket to cover his body. After arriving in Shanghai, renting a house and buying furniture consumed much of his finances. Although he still wore heavy fur clothing, he lacked the strength to carry on. Mrs. Zhu knew that Yuansha Beef Juice could nourish vitality and strengthen bones and muscles, so she bought it to add to his soup. Mr. Zhu only noticed that it tasted delicious and did not realize anything different. Severe winter had passed, and the New Year was approaching. One night, Mr. Zhu said to his wife, "In the past, I couldn't keep warm without heavy fur clothing, but tonight I don't feel cold even wearing a cotton robe. Is it because the weather in Shanghai is warmer?" Mrs. Zhu smiled. Mr. Zhu knew something was different and questioned her, finally getting the truth. He then sighed and said, "Now I know the real effect of Yuansha Company's beef juice. It is not only a good tonic but also equivalent to a fox-lined robe!" So, every day when the beef juice arrived, Mr. Zhu would say, "The fox-lined robe is here!"</p>
<h3>Children's Song Xu Zhuodai</h3>
<p>The Tang family has a little brother, only seventeen years old.</p>
<p>Last year his health was not good, his face was yellow, and he was weak.</p>
<p>He only ate half a bowl of rice, and he was not interested in studying.</p>
<p>The doctor said he had consumption, and his parents were worried.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the kind neighbor next door said he should eat young chicken.</p>
<p>Eating it every day is too troublesome, killing and cooking chickens is too much work.</p>
<p>Using Yuansha Young Chicken Juice has a greater effect and is cheaper.</p>
<p>So, he bought it and ate it every day, and his illness disappeared immediately.</p>
<p>His body is strong, his face looks good, and he can run six or seven miles.</p>
<h3>"My Feet Are Ice Cold" Chen Lingxi</h3>
<p>Yuansha Company is the only large company specializing in the production of beef juice and young chicken juice. The brand is old, the scale is large, and the reputation is resounding. I have long known about it. Many friends, because I am a mentally exhausting person with blood deficiency and a weak body, advise me to buy beef juice or young chicken juice. Several doctor friends are also recommending it, believing that it is the most effective and economical tonic in winter. Spending ten or eight dollars a month is like drinking a bottle of soda, but the effect is comparable to ginseng and deer velvet. However, I have never tried it. Because someone once told me that beef juice and the like are made from raw materials purchased from overseas. The raw material is like asphalt, bought in large barrels and sold in small bottles. So, I became somewhat distrustful and unwilling to try it.</p>
<p>Now, eating the Yuansha chicken giblets and chicken feet given to me by Mr. Chen Chengyuan of Yuansha Company has given me strong proof that Yuansha Company's products are genuine, using fresh chicken and beef, and extracting the juice using scientific methods. Therefore, from that time on, I continuously ate young chicken juice for three months.</p>
<p>How was the effect? I should also report a few words. I am a person with a weak body and many illnesses. There is no need to hide it. In winter, my wife always says that my body is not good and that I should eat some tonics. Why does she only know that my body is not good in winter? It's quite embarrassing and interesting to say. It turns out that when I go to bed and put my feet into the quilt, they always inevitably touch her. My feet are as cold as if they were fished out of cold water. This is because of the deficiency of both qi and blood. Sometimes she advises me to eat tonics, but sometimes she scolds me for having feet as cold as a dead person's. However, since taking Yuansha Young Chicken Juice, my feet have gradually become warm. Isn't this a definite proof of the great effect of Yuansha Young Chicken Juice?</p>
<p>This year, in order to avoid being scolded by my wife for having dead feet, I have started eating young chicken juice again. Last year, I went from eating chicken giblets and chicken feet to eating chicken juice. But I can't help but think of last year's chicken giblets and chicken feet. So, I have to drag on this not-so-glorious tail. This is precisely the corresponding method in writing techniques. I am not asking for chicken giblets and chicken feet to eat. If this article is seen by Mr. Chen Chengyuan, and he is careless and does not see my classical Chinese writing style, he will think that I am asking him for chicken giblets and chicken feet to eat. That would be a tragedy.</p>
<h3>Self-administered for Four Years: Great Effectiveness Physician Jiang Baozhen</h3>
<p>The beef juice and young chicken juice produced by Yuansha Company are indeed highly effective. I have been taking beef juice for four years, and mentally, I feel more fulfilled than before. For friends and patients who need to take beef juice and young chicken juice, after introducing them to it, they also praised it in unison. The method of taking it is simple, and the taste is palatable, which is also a great thing.</p>

Unexpectedly, the people in the clan have many doubts about this child, saying that people over sixty cannot have children. Therefore, they plan to exclude Yuanguan from the clan. But although my wife and I are old, we have been taking fresh beef juice from Yuansha Company every day for the past six years without interruption. Therefore, our bodies are exceptionally strong, and my wife's menstruation has never stopped due to taking beef juice. Of course, we can have sons and daughters without any doubt.

<p>A: "Then is there a way to prove it?"</p>
<p>B: "That's easy. In the past, people used chicken skin and chicken hair to describe healthy old people. If you don't eat chicken juice, where would you get chicken skin?"</p>
<h3>Dietary Dos and Don'ts for Typhoid Fever Chen Xiaoren</h3>
<p>Post-illness nutrition with beef juice and young chicken juice is the most suitable.</p>
<p>*This table applies to those with fever lasting more than two weeks from damp-heat fever, autumn fever, spring fever, and winter fever.*</p>
<h3>Beverages During the Fever Period</h3>
<p>(1) If the fever is mild and the person does not want to eat, they can be allowed to abstain from food. If they want to eat, they can eat "rice crust soup," also known as pot crust soup, rice scorch soup, or rice skin porridge. Only this soup can be eaten when there is fever. Do not let rice grains fall in. The best pot crust is the scorched and black one, as it helps the stomach qi and is easy to digest. Rice crust soup has nourishing power. This substance is a flowing liquid, which can nourish the body without stagnating in the intestines and stomach. It is the most precious tonic for typhoid fever.</p>
<p>(2) For damp-heat typhoid fever, coix seed tea (i.e., coix seed decoction, only drink the liquid) and roasted barley tea can also be taken. For summer-heat typhoid fever, lotus leaf tea, agastache tea, chrysanthemum tea, and Buddha's hand tea can also be drunk. It still needs to be administered according to the symptoms. First, seek the doctor's consent.</p>
<p>(3) Plain boiled water is the best beverage during typhoid fever. Frequent drinking is very beneficial for the consumption during fever. Recently, many patients have asked if they can drink orange juice. Although this can be drunk, it must be squeezed and drunk hot. The oranges must be large, plump, and sweet. Small, sour ones are not suitable for drinking.</p>
<p>(4) If the fever has been going on for a long time, and the fever gradually decreases, the person feels tired and thirsty for food, a thin arrowroot powder soup can be taken appropriately. (Genuine arrowroot powder must be used. If white arrowroot powder is used, it is mostly starch, water chestnut powder, or yam powder, which are not suitable.) Oatmeal soup (i.e., American oatmeal flakes, first stir-fried until scorched, then boiled into a thin soup) should be eaten with the principle of "hunger" in mind. Do not seek to be full.</p>
<p>(5) During the second stage of typhoid fever, when the fever is raging, snow water boiled tea, watermelon dew, and bamboo sap oil can be drunk according to the doctor's instructions. When the mouth is bitter, greasy, tasteless, green salt, aged tangerine peel, salted olives, and coptis root can be chewed. Change one type a day. Chew the juice and spit out the residue. This is of utmost importance.</p>
<p>(6) During the fever period of typhoid fever, drinking milk must be with the doctor's consent.</p>
<h3>The First to Fourth Days After the Fever Subsides</h3>
<p>If the typhoid fever has completely subsided, it means that the inflammation in the intestines has subsided, and the digestive function is gradually becoming active. At this time, food is needed to supply consumption. The situation is significantly different from when the fever has not subsided. From the first to the fourth day after the fever has subsided, the diet must follow the following procedure.</p>
<p>There are about five types of food: (1) Rice crust porridge (2) Arrowroot powder (3) Oatmeal soup (4) Rice and wheat noodles (5) Cantonese can eat sweet osmanthus powder soup.</p>
<p>There are about six types of beverages: (1) Barley tea (2) Coix seed tea (3) Mulberry sprout tea (4) Black tea, green tea, plain boiled water (5) Tofu juice (6) Milk.</p>
<p>There are about six types of side dishes: (1) Sweet pickled melon (spit out the residue) (2) Yunnan large mustard tuber (spit out the residue) (3) Fermented bean curd (4) Jellyfish (5) Sesame paste (6) Tofu with green salt.</p>
<p>There are about five types of fruits: (1) Oranges (2) Xinhui oranges (3) Water chestnuts (4) Olives (5) Pears.</p>
<p>Regarding dishes, there are very few dishes that can be selected as side dishes within the first four days after the fever subsides. Because when the fever first subsides, the body needs food to replenish consumption. Moreover, after a long period of hunger, people are unusually greedy. After a long period of lying down, once the illness is initially relieved, eating is the only consumption and comfort. Therefore, everyone is eager for food. There is a crisis at this time, that is, because the digestive function after typhoid fever often does not return to normal, it cannot withstand stagnation. The stomach is strong, and the intestines are weak. Therefore, it is easiest to relapse. So, it is still necessary to abstain from food after illness. The above beverages can each be taken and replaced daily to change the taste. Other items should not be tried. Greasy, meaty, raw, cold, and wild foods are all taboo.</p>
<h3>The Fifth Day After the Fever Subsides</h3>
<p>Regarding food, four more types can be added: (1) Bread slices. (2) Scorched rice porridge. (3) Winter frost rice porridge. (4) Thin rice porridge.</p>
<p>Regarding beverages, two more types can be added. (1) Fresh beef juice. (2) Fresh young chicken juice.</p>
<p>Regarding dishes, the following can be eaten: (1) Vegetable soup (2) Spinach and egg white soup. Shaoxing dried vegetable soup (3) Tomato soup (4) Egg flower soup (5) Duck soup (6) Chicken blood soup (7) Spinach and pork liver soup (8) Chicken soup (9) Luffa soup. Alternate regularly.</p>
<h3>The Tenth Day After the Fever Subsides</h3>
<p>From the tenth day after the fever subsides, thicker rice porridge can be eaten. There are also items that can be eaten without taboo: (1) Winter melon (2) Gluten (3) Yam (4) Roasted ribs (5) Ham (6) Meat floss (7) Dried cabbage (8) Dried vegetable essence (9) Bamboo shoots (10) Mushrooms (11) Tofu skin (12) Tofu skin clothing (13) Macaroni (14) Flattish bamboo shoots (15) Mung bean sprouts (16) Preserved eggs (17) Salted egg whites (18) Radishes and various pickles. The above items are numerous and can be used by patients for replacement and selection. However, they should not be eaten too much after all. The number of times can be slightly more, but the amount should not be too much. Initially, the residue must be spat out. After a while, it can be chewed and eaten.</p>
<h3>Eating Problems</h3>
<p>From the fifteenth day after the typhoid fever subsides, soft rice can be eaten. (Such as aged rice, winter frost rice, fragrant japonica rice, etc.) Wait until twenty days to a month later to return to normal. The dates mentioned should be adjusted according to the severity of the illness. Because porridge and rice are very important, this order must be followed. Eating rice too early can easily cause a relapse. At this time, avoid eating: (1) Cakes (2) Hard biscuits (3) Zongzi (4) Glutinous rice balls (5) Stewed beans (6) Chestnuts.</p>
<h3>Post-illness Recuperation Period</h3>
<p>After illness, fluids that are rich in nutrition and easy to digest are the most suitable. Therefore, after typhoid fever, chicken juice and beef juice, although they are meat products, are actually indispensable miraculous tonics for nourishing the body.</p>
<p>Some patients believe that it is not advisable to eat meat or stimulating food immediately after illness. They mistakenly believe that chicken juice and beef juice are stimulating foods. Initially, they dare not eat them. In fact, this view is a big mistake. Typhoid fever is not a surgical disease. Post-illness dietary restrictions do not prohibit meat or chicken. At this time, fluid tonics are needed. Beef juice and chicken juice are the only suitable products. There is definitely no better or more effective food. Those who have been ill for a month need to drink beef juice and chicken juice for two months. Those who have been ill for a month and a half must drink the juice for three months to restore vitality, replenish physical strength, and increase qi and blood. This is all obvious.</p>
<p>Post-illness dietary restrictions do not distinguish between meat and vegetables. Those that are easy to digest and nourishing are not taboo, even if they are meat. Those that are easy to digest but not nourishing should not be eaten, even if they are vegetables. Moreover, the appetite is weak after illness. Tonics should not be taken immediately. Because tonics stagnate the stomach, excessive medication will cause problems. Nourishing the body will harm the body instead. Chicken juice and beef juice are nourishing but not greasy and taste extremely delicious. Not only are they liked by patients, but they also do not have the drawbacks of tonics. For those who are extremely weak and tired after illness, "tonifying medicine prescriptions" must be separated by a month or until the winter season of the year before they can be taken.</p>
<h3>Resolving the Shanghai West Dispute: The Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) Drafts an Outline as a Basic Plan for Negotiations; British Troops Intensify Defenses in Shanghai West</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office issued a press release last night stating, "The Director-General and Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Mr. Fessenden, along with the Head of the Police Department, Major Bowen, are discussing several proposed outlines to be presented to Fu Xiao'an, the 'Mayor of the Special Municipality,' within a day or two, as a basic plan to resolve the dispute between the Municipal Council and the City Government." According to the aforementioned press release, regarding the dispute over road construction beyond the boundaries, since the evening of the 23rd, when the leading consul, Lieutenant Colonel Naroni, the Italian Consul-General in Shanghai, invited both parties, with the participation of the Japanese Consul, to mediate, the deadlock has been broken. What can be noted from now on is what kind of basic plan the SMC will rely on to resolve the dispute with this internationally unrecognized "Special Municipality." The following is a record of the developments yesterday:</p>
<p>Basic Principles Agreed Upon by Both Parties</p>
<p>The meeting between Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the SMC, and the pseudo-"Mayor" Fu Xiao'an on the 23rd took place at 5:00 PM at the pseudo-municipal government in the "Central District." Rumors that it was held at Fu's private residence were incorrect. Those present included the leading consul, Italian Consul-General Lieutenant Colonel Naroni, and Japanese Consul-General Miura Yoshiaki. Based on the pseudo-"Municipal Government's" demands regarding road construction beyond the boundaries, Mr. Fessenden proposed three basic principles, one of which was that the management rights of road construction beyond the boundaries would be exercised by a "Joint Management Bureau" jointly formed by the SMC and the pseudo-"Municipal Government" (similar to the principles agreed upon by Shanghai Mayor Yu Hongjun and Mr. Fessenden) to resolve the dispute. Although the parties present did not fully agree with this suggestion, they paid considerable attention to it.</p>
<p>Drafting a Plan for Negotiations</p>
<p>With the basic principles largely determined by both parties, the negotiations, which had fallen into a deadlock, are expected to resume. Yesterday, Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Chairman of the SMC, together with Mr. Bowen, Chief of the SMC Police, began drafting a resolution plan based on the results of the talks between Fessenden and Fu Xiao'an. It is reported that it will be drafted within the next few days and sent to Fu Xiao'an as a basis for discussion between the SMC and the pseudo-"Municipal Government."</p>
<p>Establishing a Management Bureau as a Transition</p>
<p>According to reliable foreign sources, the SMC's proposal to establish a "Joint Management Bureau" to resolve all disputes over road construction beyond the boundaries has a high probability of being realized. However, this joint body is only a product of the transition period to quickly end all previous states of unrest. After the establishment of the "Joint Management Bureau," the second step of work will immediately proceed, with the SMC and the pseudo-"Municipal Government" dividing the management rights of road construction beyond the boundaries, that is, transferring all management rights of a certain part of road construction beyond the boundaries to the pseudo-"Municipal Government," while the SMC retains the rights and interests of the remaining roads. When the SMC abandons a portion of road construction beyond the boundaries, the SMC will simultaneously seek compensation from the pseudo-"Municipal Government" for the expenses incurred by the SMC in the past for land acquisition, road construction, road maintenance, drainage pipes, engineering, etc., for road construction beyond the boundaries, as well as the investments made by public utility companies in the area. The pseudo-"Municipal Government" has already indicated at the beginning of the negotiations on road construction beyond the boundaries that the expenses of the SMC and public utility companies in the area can be compensated. Therefore, it is generally believed that the main views of both parties have become similar, and the results of the recent talks are said to be good. Therefore, it is believed that the long-standing dispute will be resolved in the short term.</p>
<p>SMC Discusses Proposed Outlines</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reported, "This morning (the 25th), reliable sources said that after Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the SMC, held talks with Fu Xiao'an at his residence on Sunday night, accompanied by Italian Consul-General Nilon and Japanese Consul Miura, Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the SMC, and Mr. Bowen, Head of the Police Department, are now drafting several rough proposals to be submitted to Fu Xiao'an within a day or two as a basis for resolving the dispute between the two parties. Thus, the long-standing issue of roads outside the Shanghai boundary is taking a major step towards understanding and normalcy." It is heard that the detailed plans currently being drafted by Fessenden and Bowen are not yet complete, but it is generally believed that the main purpose of the proposals is to seek the greatest possible understanding of the proposals previously put forward by the "Special Municipality of Shanghai" regarding the issue of roads outside the boundary.</p>
<p>Jurisdiction over Roads Must Be Divided</p>
<p>Over the past week, reporters have made private inquiries to officials of the SMC and the "Municipal Government." Several of them believe that the entire incident can be resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. It is also heard that the SMC and the "Municipal Government" authorities, during consultations, proposed a joint management of the area of roads outside the boundary by the SMC and the "Municipal Government" police stations. However, according to the views expressed by the officials, while the possibility of joint management by both parties is commendable, it is not expected to be possible. Several officials also firmly believe that joint management of roads outside the boundary (including tax collection, etc.) will likely be quite short-lived. The general feeling is that after this initial agreement, the division of jurisdiction over the roads will be drafted. It is said that this means that several roads will be completely controlled by the "Special Municipality," while other roads will be managed by the SMC.</p>
<p>Pseudo-Government Compensates Municipal Expenses</p>
<p>It is generally believed that after an agreement is reached on these or similar conditions, the SMC will submit a "bill of expenses" to the "Municipal Government" for the roads outside the boundary transferred to the management of the "Special Municipality." This "expense" may include the construction costs of "returning" the roads. The "Municipal Government" will compensate for the funds spent on drainage and land acquisition, as well as the expenses incurred by various public convenience companies in the area. When Fu Xiao'an initiated negotiations, he proposed that all expenses of the SMC and public convenience companies in the area of roads outside the boundary should be compensated. Since the "Municipal Government" holds this attitude, well-informed sources claimed this morning that direct negotiations between the two parties will begin soon, and it is hoped that hopeful results and full understanding will be achieved, and all difficulties in fully resolving the long-standing dispute will be resolved.</p>
<p>British Troops Deployed for Contingencies</p>
<p>The intersections of Yidingpan Road, Yu Yuan Road, and Yidingpan Road, Da Xi Road in the area of road construction beyond the boundary are equipped with red and green traffic lights, which are managed by the SMC police. The pseudo-police have repeatedly tried to seize them, but have not succeeded. Since the assault on the patrolmen at the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Yu Yuan Road on the 20th, in order to strengthen defenses, the police have been dispatching Chinese and foreign detectives to be stationed at the two locations in the past few days. At the same time, British defense forces have also been deployed and built sandcastles at both locations. A small sandcastle had previously been added at the southeast corner of Yidingpan Road and Yu Yuan Road. Yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM, the sandcastle at the southwest corner of Yidingpan Road and Da Xi Road was dismantled and rebuilt on the sidewalk at the northwest corner. The inside and outside of the sandcastle are nailed with wooden boards, and the top is covered with a wooden shed. All the engineering is stronger than the original construction. It is understood that the British defense forces at the two locations, in addition to a portion stationed at the corners, another portion is stationed in borrowed civilian houses, ready to be dispatched at any time. In the future, the defense of the two locations will be safe. The situation in the Caogangdu area has been calm in recent days, and order has been restored to the state before the incident.</p>
<p>Japanese Spokesperson Advocates for the Pseudo-Regime</p>
<p>The spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy stated at the press conference last night, "The main views on the issue of road construction beyond the boundary in Shanghai West have been agreed upon by the SMC and the 'Special Municipality,' so a final friendly resolution can be expected. When the two parties met on the 23rd, the SMC recognized the 'Special Municipality's' claimed sovereignty over road construction beyond the boundary. Since there is no dispute over the point of sovereignty, it is believed that the SMC will automatically hand over the taxation and management rights of road construction beyond the boundary to the 'Special Municipality.' Now that the main views are the same, the only remaining issues to be discussed are the SMC's recovery of investment in road construction beyond the boundary, and how to properly maintain security and order in the area." When asked what kind of taxes the pseudo-"Municipal Government" is currently collecting in the area, the spokesperson immediately denied that the pseudo-"Municipal Government" is currently collecting taxes in the area, and said, "All taxes are currently collected by the SMC, but this does not mean that the SMC has the legal right to collect taxes in the area. However, the SMC has established various public utilities in the area, so it should be compensated. As for the SMC's investment in the area, the 'Special Municipality' has also recognized it, so there is no dispute on this point between the two parties." When asked about the rumors that the SMC and the pseudo-"Municipal Government" will jointly form a "Joint Management Bureau" to govern road construction beyond the boundary, the spokesperson replied, "I have not heard of it. When Mr. Fessenden, Chairman of the SMC, visited 'Mayor' Fu Xiao'an, it is understood that he brought three plans, but did not submit any of the plans to the 'Mayor,' so at this time, there is no answer to this point."</p>
<h3>The Four Lines Isolated Army's Heroic Battle: Today Marks the Second Anniversary; Regiment Commander Xie is Scheduled to Lead All Officers and Soldiers in a Commemoration at 3:00 PM Today</h3>
<p>Today is the glorious second anniversary of the Four Lines Isolated Army's heroic battle that began at the Four Lines Warehouse in Zhabei. On October 26th of the year before last, after the Chinese army withdrew from Zhabei, the Four Lines Isolated Army defended the Four Lines Warehouse on Suzhou Road and began a heroic and magnificent battle. At that time, the residents of the concession, along the Suzhou River, admired the only shining national emblem on the Four Lines Warehouse, and everyone was moved to tears. The spirit of loyalty and righteousness was enough to shock the heavens and move the ghosts and gods, unfolding one of the most glorious pages in the history of the Chinese army's resistance against Japan. Even the friendly countries of Europe and the United States were amazed. The isolated army resisted for seven days. Then, the authorities of Shanghai and other countries, because the Four Lines Warehouse was adjacent to the concession and the shells were flying around, affecting the security and order of the concession, were compelled to urge the highest authorities of the Chinese army to order the withdrawal. Currently, all 400 officers and soldiers of the regiment are still staying in the barracks on Jiaozhou Road, working hard on health exercises and military training. Their determination to serve the country has not been released. It is now known that all officers and soldiers of the regiment will hold a grand commemoration and dinner today at 3:00 PM under the leadership of Regiment Commander Xie, as today is the second anniversary of the Four Lines Resistance.</p>
<p>American Diplomatic Agencies</p>
<p>Consolidated Office</p>
<p>All Moved into Construction Building; American Commercial Department Also Moved</p>
<p>The Continental News reports that the first result of the reorganization of American diplomatic agencies here will be seen, as the Office of the American Commercial Attaché in China, the Office of the American Agricultural Commissioner, and the Company Registry are scheduled to move to the new address on the third floor of the Construction Building at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road on October 30th. These three offices, under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of State, have been united with the U.S. Consulate General to implement President Roosevelt's "Reorganization Plan No. 2," which is expected to eliminate duplication of government office work. After the three offices begin working at the new address early next week, most of the U.S. offices in Shanghai will be concentrated. The seventh and eighth floors of the Construction Building are the U.S. Naval Procurement Office, the sixth floor is the U.S. Court for China, and the fourth and fifth floors are the U.S. Consulate General. The U.S. Company Registrar in China is Ms. Smith, the Commercial Counselor is Mr. An Lide, and the Agricultural Commissioner Tao Sen is scheduled to return to Shanghai in December.</p>
<p>In addition, according to a letter from the American Commercial Department in China and the Company Registry, from October 30th (Sunday), they will move to the third floor of the Construction Building at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road (i.e., downstairs from the U.S. Consulate General in Shanghai) for office work.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Passenger Train Destroyed by Landmine Again: Train Derails Between Chang'an and Xiaoshi After Hitting Landmine; More Than a Dozen Japanese Soldiers and Passengers Killed and Injured</h3>
<p>Hua Dong News reports that, according to passengers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, less than half a month after several flower cars carrying Japanese and puppet military officers were bombed and destroyed by guerrillas between Chang'an and Xiaoshi on the Shanghai-Hangzhou line, and dozens of officers and soldiers were killed, an incident of vehicles hitting landmines and being bombed continued to occur between Xiaoshi and Chang'an on the morning of the 24th. Moreover, the situation of this bombing was more violent than the last time. The last train from Shanghai to Hangzhou on the 23rd usually runs to Jiaxing for the night and then departs from Jiaxing to Hangzhou the next morning (i.e., the 24th). Unexpectedly, the train hit a landmine about five or six kilometers away from Chang'an Station after passing Xiaoshi, destroying 12 vehicles on the spot and completely destroying the locomotive. It is also heard that the scope of this bombing was wider than the last time, and the damaged rails were about one kilometer long. In addition, several freight cars were attached to the passenger train, which were full of pigs, and all were bombed to death. In addition, more than a dozen Japanese mechanics and Japanese soldiers were killed and injured, and dozens of passengers were also killed and injured. According to a merchant from Hangzhou to Shanghai yesterday, I (the merchant claimed himself) happened to take the early train from Hangzhou to Shanghai on the morning of the 24th. Unexpectedly, the train could not move when it reached Xucun. According to people at the station, vehicles were bombed by landmines again between Chang'an and Xiaoshi, and there was a fear of a guerrilla attack. The Japanese troops stationed at the station first deployed defenses on the train and slowly moved forward. When the train arrived at Chang'an Station, the Japanese troops disembarked first and set up sentries at the bombed site to implement a cordon. Then, the passengers carried bags and suitcases and disembarked one after another, walked about two li, and then boarded a passenger train that had been parked on the track in advance and drove to Shanghai again. The early passenger train from Hangzhou to Shanghai usually arrives in Shanghai at 12:00 noon. Because of this, the train arrived at the North Station as late as 7:00 PM. It is said that the vehicles destroyed this time were almost completely destroyed, and the blood and flesh were blurred, which was too horrible to bear. The damaged rails are very long, and it is feared that it will be difficult to repair them completely in a short time, and the journey is very painful and extremely risky.</p>
<h3>Yao Youlian's Troops in Shanghai West Engaged in Fierce Battle with Japanese Troops: Five Japanese Soldiers Killed and Two Captured; Puppet Troops in Caojing Repeatedly Attempted to Revolt</h3>
<p>According to a person from Shanghai West, Yao Youlian's troops of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army were originally stationed in Chengjiaqiao, Shanghai West. Yesterday afternoon (the 21st) at 1:00 PM, a fierce guerrilla battle broke out. It is understood that the team there is led by Team Leader Wang, with strong strength, known as Yao's elite. On the morning of the same day, Team Leader Wang learned from a secret report that the Japanese army was coming, and immediately ordered preparations. At about 1:00 PM, a team of Japanese troops arrived at Chengjiaqiao, carrying several light and heavy machine guns. The situation was very tense for a while. Team Leader Wang took the lead and gave a strong resistance. Suddenly, gunfire was heard all around, and the two sides fought fiercely. In this battle, five Japanese soldiers were killed and two were captured. They have now been sent to headquarters for disposal. The residents there are also afraid that the Japanese army will come back to vent their anger, and have all moved away. It is heard that Yao's troops recently received an order from their superiors to expand the organization and strengthen their strength. After receiving the order, Yao strengthened training and spared no effort, while thoroughly reforming the internal staff. According to Yao's recent statement, what is most painful is that the friendly troops cannot deeply understand, resulting in various misunderstandings in the past. In the future, he hopes that the friendly troops can understand the great purpose of saving the country and work together. In addition, in the Caohejing town, Shanghai West, the "Bandit Suppression Team" of three or four hundred men under Han Jun, who were originally stationed in the Second Prison, have recently repeatedly tried to take the opportunity to revolt due to the deep understanding of righteousness by the officers and soldiers of the team. The Japanese side sent a team to be stationed in the Caoxi Road Caojia Ancestral Hall and the Yumingxiqin Institute of the Guanshengyuan Biscuit Factory in the town, with about two hundred people.</p>
<h3>Improvement in Foreign Trade: Sharp Reduction in Excess of Imports</h3>
<p>Excess of Imports Reduced by More Than 20 Million: Smallest Figure This Year</p>
<p>In September, due to the outbreak of the European War, imports of foreign goods fell sharply as never before. Exports of local goods were less affected due to the smooth sales to the United States. According to the trade figures released by the Customs yesterday, the net value of imports of foreign goods nationwide in September was 93,781,043 yuan in national currency, and the net value of exports of local goods was 85,424,738 yuan in national currency. The excess of imports was 8,756,305 yuan, a decrease of 36,600,970 yuan in imports compared with August, a decrease of 15,443,003 yuan in exports, and a decrease of 20,766,967 yuan in the excess of imports. The figure for the excess of imports in September is the smallest this year, which proves that China's trade has improved.</p>
<h3>U.S. Asiatic Fleet to Commemorate Navy Day Tomorrow: Will Not Change Past Attitudes Due to the European War; Augusta to Host American僑民</h3>
<p>The development of the United States Navy, now second only to the United Kingdom, and its strength ranking above the navies of all countries in the world, should be attributed to the late President Theodore Roosevelt, who was in office from 1901 to 1909. Therefore, the U.S. Navy authorities have designated his birthday, October 27, as U.S. Navy Day. When the late President Roosevelt was in office, he spared no effort to expand the navy and completed the "Great White Fleet." Today, as World War II is in full swing in Central Europe, the American people attach greater significance to the commemoration this year. Even though the U.S. Navy will issue new regulations prohibiting the disclosure of news about naval operations in order to prevent espionage activities, it is generally believed that the U.S. Navy will still hold a grand commemoration ceremony in accordance with traditional attitudes, and invite all American侨民 in Shanghai to "board a U.S. warship and visit your navy." The flagship Augusta of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, commanded by Admiral Heard, is scheduled to be open for inspection within the specified time tomorrow for all local American侨民 to board and visit. Admiral Heard has not issued any contrary orders to date. Yesterday, the U.S. warships anchored on the Huangpu River and outside the Wusongkou were all flying the national flag, fluttering in the air. According to last year, the U.S. Navy Department held a large-scale commemorative ceremony as usual. The U.S. Navy Grand Marshal spoke to the American public nationwide via radio in Washington, as well as to the Commander of the 16th U.S. Naval Detachment in the Philippines, the Commander of the Mediterranean Patrol Fleet, and so on, informing them of future plans and the significance of the commemoration. The U.S. Navy's plans and budget for this year will build more battleships, destroyers, and cruisers. The next Congress will increase the naval budget to an unprecedented level, exceeding the "Wilson Proposal" signed and approved by the current U.S. President Roosevelt last year. Other air force budget proposals have also been submitted to Congress to cope with this dramatic change.</p>
<p>Various Sectors Appeal</p>
<p>to Cancel the Order for Tribute Rice</p>
<p>After entrusting the Shanghai Accountants Association to handle the registration of ordering Saigon ocean rice, about 100 companies went to register, totaling more than 15,700 bags of ocean rice to be ordered. At the end of September, due to the Saigon authorities' prohibition of rice exports, all rice buyers were notified to postpone the process. Now, the Shanghai rice price has gradually declined, and the citizens' worries have been eliminated. Therefore, the purchasers who have already registered have applied for cancellation one after another. It is heard that the joint ordering of ocean rice will be terminated on a regular basis.</p>
<p>Four Banks Loan Committee</p>
<p>Loan Balance Approximately</p>
<p>17.7 Million Yuan</p>
<p>The loan balance of the Shanghai Loan Committee of the four banks of Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China in August is estimated to be 17.7 million yuan. Among them, the balance directly loaned by the committee is about 16 million yuan, accounting for about 90%. The amount transferred by the Joint Reserve Committee of Banks accounts for about 6.24%, and the amount transferred by the Joint Reserve Depository of the Money Industry accounts for about 3.32%.</p>
<h3>Large Batch of Outstanding Chinese Children Transported to Tokyo Yesterday</h3>
<p>Some outstanding orphans in our occupied areas are now considered by the Japanese side as rare commodities and have been collected. It is learned that a large number of boys and girls have been taken in by the Japanese Shanghai Buddhist Association and the Sino-Japanese Religious Great Alliance, and 22 outstanding boys and girls have been selected and transported to Japan, where they will be educated. The children were sent to the Nagasaki Maru by the Japanese side yesterday to leave Shanghai for Tokyo. (She Wen She)</p>

<h3>Situation in Jia District North of Suzhou River Gradually Returning to Quiet: British Troops and Chinese Police Patrol and Stationed as Usual; Japanese Troops Prevent Trade Across Barbed Wire Fence</h3>
<p>Since the change in the defense zone of the Jia district north of Suzhou River by British and Japanese troops, the shops west of North Jiangxi Road have been completely blocked by barbed wire and obstacles, cutting off normal traffic. All sales and purchases must be made with a permit before being allowed to enter through the two gaps and detour. As a result, eight or nine out of ten shops have been closed, and the cityscape is extremely desolate. A reporter from Da Guang She patrolled the area yesterday and saw that several shops were forced to put all their wealth on sale or solicit top tenants. There were also three or four rice shops that revealed that they had a pass to enter the rice and sell goods. They greeted rice buyers outside the barbed wire fence, but said they could not negotiate. According to a merchant, after the obstacles were set up, the shops could still deliver goods as usual through the barbed wire fence, but after the Japanese troops discovered this, they beat them up and forbade them from accepting sales and purchases across the barbed wire fence. The shops were afraid of the power of the Japanese troops, so they had to endure the pain and close down. The Japanese troops repaired the barbed wire fence blocked by the Japanese troops at the target road intersection at the bottom of North Jiangxi Road because several places were damaged. Yesterday afternoon at about 3:00 PM, four Japanese troops carried iron hammers, iron cones, and other objects, led by an officer, and repaired the area. It took more than an hour to complete the work.</p>
<p>Police Officers Patrol as Usual</p>
<p>According to a reporter from Da Tong She who inspected the area between North Jiangxi Road and North Henan Road yesterday morning, the situation was quite calm. The patrol of the Japanese troops in the area was also significantly reduced, while the Chinese police of the Huishi Police Station patrolled the various sections of the area as usual. Various vehicles in the guarded sections west of North Jiangxi Road and east of North Henan Road still passed without obstruction. However, only rickshaws and sedan cars were allowed to enter and exit the gaps in the barbed wire fence set up in North Jiangxi Road. Other vehicles were prohibited from traveling back and forth.</p>
<p>No Harsh Treatment in Residential Areas</p>
<p>The household registration in the various sections of the area has not been forcibly implemented to date. The situation in the area is different from that in Hongkou. It seems that the Japanese side will not arbitrarily impose various harsh policies. Therefore, for the shops or households currently living in the area, there is still no significant inconvenience or restriction.</p>
<p>British Troops Stationed at North Henan Road</p>
<p>The British troops at the barbed wire gate and in the bunker at the bottom of North Henan Road are still stationed as usual. A British soldier is stationed at the Qianjiang Guild Hall gate post at the intersection of North Henan Road and Haining Road. Opposite the gate is a Chinese police officer guarding the sentry box. The intersections of North Henan Road, Tiantong Road, and North Suzhou Road are also guarded by Chinese police officers.</p>
<h3>Registration Procedures for Export Settlement Goods: Those Transported to Hong Kong Must Register with Fu Hua; Re-export of Transit Goods Requires a Duplicate Certificate</h3>
<p>The Trade Committee under the Ministry of Finance has formulated registration procedures for export settlement goods. (1) Any merchant who transports export settlement goods to Hong Kong for sale must register with Fu Hua Company in Hong Kong upon arrival in Hong Kong. The registration agency for export goods that are not transported through Hong Kong for sale will be designated by the Trade Committee at any time. (2) When a merchant registers with Fu Hua Company or other designated agency, they must submit a purchase foreign exchange certificate for verification and obtain an export settlement goods registration form. (3) Upon receiving the registration form filled out by the merchant, Fu Hua Company or other designated agency will check it to ensure that it is consistent with the information contained in the purchase foreign exchange certificate, and will immediately store the registration form, fill out an export settlement goods registration certificate, and issue it to the merchant together with the purchase foreign exchange certificate. (4) The export settlement goods registration certificate mentioned in the preceding paragraph shall be submitted by the merchant when applying for a certificate of actual sales price. In addition, in order to facilitate the transportation of local goods to other ports and inland areas, the Jianghai Customs has approved that local goods transported to this port by non-ordinary vessels shall enjoy the benefits of re-export. Now, in order to improve the speed of transporting local goods to foreign countries, the Commissioner of Customs has stipulated that if local goods that have completed transit tax in this port are transported to other ports and then intend to be exported to foreign countries, if they wish to apply to the Customs for an export certificate in order to apply for a tax refund from the Customs where the goods arrive, they must prepare a duplicate of the certificate and submit it to the Customs for direct delivery to the Customs of that port, so that the goods can be quickly shipped when they arrive at the port and avoid disputes. All customs brokers and merchants in this port have heard this and have followed the instructions.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Students Respond to the Winter Clothing Drive</h3>
<p>The cultural, educational, and student circles of this city have widely embraced the winter clothing drive. The achievements of major middle and elementary schools are quite remarkable. The enthusiasm of the cultural, educational, and student circles of this city for national affairs is evident. Now, the drive has been promoted to elementary school students, who are also participating voluntarily. The number of elementary school students in this city is the highest among all cities in the country, and their achievements will undoubtedly be even more impressive.</p>
<h3>The President Liners Arrive in Shanghai One After Another</h3>
<p>British commercial liners, whether traveling the Far East or European routes, will not announce their sailing schedules, including departure and arrival dates, in order to adapt to wartime measures after the European war and avoid attacks. This applies to both ocean-going giants and coastal vessels. This order has already arrived here, so British commercial liner companies in this city will comply. Furthermore, it is learned that the American President Liner Company's President Pierce arrived in Shanghai from Rocky Mountain at 10:30 yesterday morning, carrying 101 passengers and 47 bags of American mail. The liner is scheduled to depart for Zamboanga and Manila at 7:00 this morning. The company's President Cleveland is expected to sail back to Shanghai from Manila and Hong Kong on the afternoon of the 28th, berthing at buoy number 12.13. The passenger tender will arrive at the new customs pier at 2:30 that afternoon. The large liner is scheduled to weigh anchor at 8:00 on the morning of the 29th and return to Los Angeles via Kobe, Yokohama, Honolulu, and San Francisco. Additionally, the Java Mail Line's Tjinegara is scheduled to depart this afternoon, returning to Java via Xiamen, Hong Kong, and Manila.</p>
<h3>Exemption of Foreign Exchange Settlement for Domestic Goods Shipped to Shanghai; Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram Expressing Gratitude</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, having received approval for the exemption of foreign exchange settlement for domestic goods shipped to Shanghai, has sent a telegram expressing its gratitude. The telegram reads: "Respectfully addressed to the Ministry of Finance in Chongqing. Your telegraph of the 'Qiao' code has been received with gratitude. The exemption of foreign exchange settlement for domestic goods shipped to Shanghai, except for those specifically designated, is a virtuous decree that will be appreciated by all industries. This telegram is sent in reply to express our sincere gratitude. Respectfully, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Repair of Yitang Lane Bridge; Temporary Interruption of Traffic</h3>
<p>The Yitang Lane Bridge, which connects Shanxi Road to North Shanxi Road, is currently undergoing repairs by the Public Works Department of the Public Concession due to bridge damage. Traffic will be temporarily interrupted during the repair period. The department has blocked both ends of the bridge and erected wooden signs prohibiting the passage of people and vehicles. Those who wish to cross the bridge to the north of Suzhou Creek must detour via Tianhou Palace Bridge or Old Zha Gate Bridge.</p>
<h3>After Exemption of Foreign Exchange Settlement for Domestic Goods, Shanghai-Ningbo Passenger and Cargo Transport are Fully Loaded; Hai Da Not Allowed to Carry Passengers, Did Not Depart Yesterday; Xin'an Na to Conduct Trial Voyage to Wenzhou Today</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance stipulated that all domestic goods exported from Ningbo must be settled in foreign exchange, merchants had to double the cost of procurement, making it impossible to purchase. As a result, the transport of domestic goods to Shanghai disappeared, and the shipping lines were significantly affected. Therefore, the Sino-Italian Company's Ende, Jardine Matheson's Taipo, and Butterfield &amp; Swire's Yingzhou successively changed their routes.</p>
<p>It is now learned that the Shanghai and Ningbo Chambers of Commerce have sent numerous telegrams to the Ministry of Finance, requesting the exemption of foreign exchange settlement in order to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. The Ministry of Finance has approved the request. The first batch of exported goods, 1,200 pieces of domestic paper, has been transported by Jardine Matheson's Hai Da. The second batch, loaded on the Moufu, also arrived in Shanghai on Tuesday. It is said that the third batch, loaded on the Yongtai Marler, fully loaded, may arrive today or tomorrow. In the future, the previous method can still be followed, and traffic will be unimpeded.</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Ningbo shipping line has become active again. As for goods transported to Ningbo, there are also quite a few. The Hai Da was originally scheduled to depart for Ningbo at 4:00 the afternoon before yesterday. Due to the large amount of cargo, it could not be fully loaded, so the departure was changed to yesterday afternoon. However, it still could not be fully loaded, so it was changed again to midnight last night. The ship had previously sold more than 700 passenger tickets. Unexpectedly, at around 4:00 yesterday afternoon, Jardine Matheson received a notice from the Norwegian Consul that the Hai Da was not allowed to carry passengers. Most of the passengers had already boarded the ship, so the company sent personnel to the ship to explain to the passengers and exchange tickets for the Deping. Those who did not want to exchange tickets were refunded the fare. This procedure was not completed until 10:00 last night. A small number of passengers refused to exchange tickets, refused to refund the tickets, and refused to disembark. The crew tried to persuade them without success. Therefore, the ship could not weigh anchor. According to the crew, the ship could only depart after all passengers had disembarked. It was impossible to depart tonight (i.e., last night), so the departure was changed to this morning for Ningbo. The Moufu is scheduled to depart for Ningbo this afternoon. It is said that both passengers and cargo are fully loaded. The British liner Xin'an Na, represented by the American company William Weiley &amp; Han Company in this city, after a trial voyage to Fujian and back to Shanghai, is now maintaining Shanghai-Wenzhou transportation. It has been chartered by Xie Yu and others from the customs declaration firm and is scheduled to conduct a trial voyage to Wenzhou today, carrying a large number of passengers and cargo. If it is not allowed to depart, it will change course to Ao Jiang. If it still cannot enter Ao Jiang, it will proceed to Zhenhai.</p>

<h3>The Harvest of the Times</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>I believe that the path of literary workers is not permanently bound by rules and regulations. It does not have a fixed and unchangeable track and must change with the ever-changing times and environment. The American critic Calverton argued this in "The Sociological Criticism of Literature." In China, there is also a saying that "if there is no new change, it cannot replace the hero," and "one should be afraid of all old things." (See "Book of Qi, Biography of Literature") The only reason for this is that literature certainly "inherits from the past," but more importantly, it "enlightens the future." On the one hand, it is true, as Le Bon said, "the dead guide more than the living," but it is more meaningful to say that modern people influence the future than to say that modern people are influenced by the ancients.</p>
<p>Nietzsche said, "You don't have to love the country of your ancestors, but love the country of your grandchildren." These two sentences are sufficient to show the importance of pioneering an era. Sydney Herbert, in his book "Nationality and its Problems," drew many examples from the history of English literature to illustrate that the revival of literature in a certain period is often enough to make the nationality also have vitality. It can be seen that the importance of literature lies not only in reflecting or expressing the times, but also in being able to pioneer the times and influence the spirit of the nationality of future generations.</p>
<p>"Canglang Shihua says: Before the Dali era, it was clearly a set of language. In the late Tang Dynasty, it was clearly a different set of language." This illustrates that even the appearance of the front and back of a dynasty is different. It can be seen that literature reflects the times. As long as the times have undergone some great changes, this wonderful photograph that contains the reflection will naturally become dazzling and moving. Therefore, we can say that the times are the roots, buds, branches and leaves of plants, while literature is the flowering and fruiting of them. Reflecting the times is not a problem, just as flowering and fruiting are natural things. But we must pay attention to this: before harvesting, we must add some horticultural surgery of moving branches and cutting leaves to make it more suitable for our own needs, and how to pick flowers and how to pick fruits, these should also be carefully studied. Just as we said just now, to open up an era, what kind of path should we take?</p>
<p>According to Le Bon's theory that the influence of predecessors on future generations is very powerful, we should naturally revive the sound nationality that has been neglected for a long time, whether intentionally or unintentionally, which also coincides with Herbert's theory. The best example in China is the liberation of the ancient prose style of the Qin and Han dynasties from the hands of the Four Great Masters of the early Tang Dynasty, and the revival of the empirical spirit of the Han Confucians in the Qing Dynasty. However, it should be absolutely noted that this is definitely not the inheritance of ancestors accepted lock, and picking and choosing still depend on the guidance of the leaders of the times.</p>
<p>Based on this, the harvest of the times is more than just the environment at that time. The past is also a kind of source. However, relying solely on this method is absolutely not enough, and "the dominant concept of an era" cannot but be firmly grasped. Taine said, "No matter what period, there will inevitably be a dominant concept that always runs through it. For two to five hundred years, ideal characters have often existed in the present. The Middle Ages was the age of warriors and monks; our classical age was the age of the court and gentle debaters." Then our era naturally also has a "dominant concept" of a goal. This "dominant concept" exists in everyone's heart and feels deeply sad and oppressed, it can be said that few people are exceptions, and it is extremely suitable to use it to express the national spirit of this era. As for the ancient "barbarians who confuse the Xia", the historical facts and the spirit of the nationality, we may also use them to revive literature. However, this is definitely not the only harvest of the times. The current era has its unique characteristics that are different from those of its predecessors, and there is a "dominant concept" existing in the hearts of some people. We must not ignore this.</p>
<h3>Silver in the Miao Region</h3>
<p>— Yan Changxu</p>
<p>"I don't want paper money!" When I arrived in southern Guizhou and wanted to buy an egg for a dime, an old woman answered me like this. This attitude could not help but surprise me, so I asked back, "If you don't want paper money, what can you use? Why don't you want the central government's money?"</p>
<p>The answer was very simple: "We use small change, because paper money can be torn or burned by fire if you're not careful, and we don't know if it's real or fake."</p>
<p>"Hmm!" It was for this reason that my heart was naturally uneasy.</p>
<p>"Small change! What does small change look like?" I began to ask for the second time.</p>
<p>"Small change! Uh! It looks like this." As she spoke, she took out a silver coin from 1920 from her pocket, the kind that we used to use in Shanghai and other places, and showed it to me with a somewhat impatient look.</p>
<p>"Oh! Small change, so that's what it is." I smiled, but then turned to pain.</p>
<p>For the sake of business, she seemed to change her attitude: "Sir, it doesn't matter if you don't have small change; but paper money has to be discounted by 20%, otherwise,..."</p>
<p>Knowing that she was going to say "I don't want it!" but my stomach was empty, I was really a little panicked, so I interrupted her, "Okay! 20% off then!" Only then did I manage to buy a few eggs.</p>
<p>While sitting on a low stool peeling eggshells, I saw a Han Chinese and greeted him and started talking. Later, we also talked about this issue in a rambling way. It turned out that he had lived here for many years and understood everything very well: "They—the Miao people—don't rely on outside forces for anything. Outsiders who come here must buy their things; if you don't have small change, there's no way to do it except by exchanging things with them. They have a self-sufficient instinct. Now, look; you can't estimate how much silver each Miao person (except for a few poor ones) has in their hands. At the same time, for safety, almost every family has a cellar that is not easy for outsiders to find..."</p>
<p>He fell silent and then looked at me very deeply.</p>
<p>I blankly stuffed the whole egg into my mouth, thinking, "This is not good, we really need to get more political work done with these Miao people."</p>
<p>I looked at him, and he smiled.</p>
<p>I chewed the egg in confusion, trying to swallow it, but suddenly I felt suffocated and couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>"What's the point of stuffing it down like that?"</p>
<p>I glared at him again and realized that he was talking about hiding silver. I secretly laughed at myself for being so hasty and clumsy in my actions.</p>
<h3>The Nourishment of Life</h3>
<p>— Zhang Genyuan</p>
<p>Every evening, as I walk through this open space filled with a heavy stench, I am always so moved: How much people need this nourishment of life!</p>
<p>I watch those laborers; they seem to have completely forgotten the day's toil and all their worries. They mingle in the crowd, laughing and talking; everything is positive, energetic, far removed from their own gloomy lives. Here, they find joy, no! They find the nourishment of life!</p>
<p>In this exceptionally suffocating and foul-smelling corner—the only place they can gather, near their dilapidated houses—these laborers often come running to assemble at this seemingly predetermined time. Those tired and sallow faces begin to smile in the moonlight, and those bloodshot eyes also gleam with joyful radiance. They listen to each other's stories and pour out what they want to say in front of the crowd. Some are joyful, singing low-class tunes that would make noble ladies frown, or telling obscene jokes similar to those of gentlemen; some are excited, telling legendary tales of great victories in the Changsha battles, or pounding their chests and vowing that they would rather die than be traitors or slaves of a fallen nation; some are resentful, loudly scolding a certain boss who only knows how to bow and scrape to certain merchants, begging them to deign to eat with him, yet stingily exploiting them, or cursing the ruthlessness of the passport officials… In these moments, they are happy. Although the foul odor constantly assaults their noses, they habitually and warmly absorb it while pouring out a bellyful of grievances, just like wealthy people sitting in magnificent living rooms. They often gesticulate wildly as they speak. And there is absolute freedom to yawn, sneeze, and stretch, without anyone interfering with them, except perhaps their wives, who have the right to call them in to sleep. Occasionally, the young kids, Little Sanzi and Little Liuzi, annoyingly reach out to beg for copper coins, only to be met with a wide-eyed, intimidating rebuke: "Bah! Where's the copper coin from? There's none! We're barely making ends meet! One move and it's a penny gone."</p>
<p>There is an old man who doesn't talk much, but I often see him as one of them. He often sits by a pile of garbage, pensively smoking his cigarette. On the surface, it seems he doesn't like talking much to the young people, but his face is constantly revealing a smile of nostalgic fascination. He is a lonely old man! The young people don't pay much attention to him (the young people think he is lonely.) But he desperately needs this nourishment of life. Even though he doesn't talk much, he is satisfied. Although his youth has already flashed through his life, watching these young people is his comfort!</p>
<p>I stand there, sometimes motionless.</p>
<p>Walking home, so moved.</p>
<p>The old man's smile, the young laborers' joy, surround my heart; I feel lonely, I eagerly yearn for such nourishment of life!</p>
<h3>Memory</h3>
<p>— Pinpin</p>
<p>Baudelaire said, "If I could live a thousand years, my memories would be even more numerous." How much he valued memory! But I saw one of our poets write: If people had no memory, they would be happier. He originally despised memory so much.</p>
<p>I feel confused. Why do people's thoughts diverge like mountain paths? I thought for a while, hoping for a solution. Oh, I understand; memories are of all kinds, so opinions about memory also vary greatly.</p>
<p>Memories, in a very rough generalization, are of two kinds: memories of one's own past life; memories of the nation's past events.</p>
<p>If a person's memory is mostly painful. A person only opens the treasure chest of memory when in poverty: love letters, gifts of love, debt notes, childhood spinning tops, mother's needlework, rejected manuscripts... everything is covered in dust, and even things that are not dim become dim. For example, you find a red peach leaf, or a stub of a check; in the past, it was glorious, but now you are trapped, poor, and holding it in your palm, you will have a bitter taste in your throat—these things have scattered like clouds, and like the sea, they will never return. The wealthy do not know memory; they already have both fish and bear paws. The poor want to pan for a little gold in memory, but in vain, instead panning out a handful of tears.</p>
<p>Then it is the turn of another kind of memory. Let us put history aside; it is too old to stir up big waves. You should remember the motherland's struggle in the past two years! At a snowy crossroads, in front of an autumn wind-swept window, by the water's edge under the blazing sun, you must close your eyes and think: your hometown has turned to ashes, your relatives have bled and died, loyal soldiers are fighting, wounded, and martyred in severe cold and heat (when they destroy the invaders), your friends are serving in the rear... many, many stories of blood and sweat, and the center of it all is one thing: the liberation of the Republic of China. Shame, envy, anger, all make the heart beat faster. You must let the heart beat; once the heart dies, strength is also gone. Although with a bit of bitter taste, this bitter taste is the bitter taste of medicine, which will heal your departing strength.</p>
<p>Don't be discouraged, just remember, let the memory of the old struggle of the motherland be the inspirer of the waves of our lives!</p>

<h3>Film Knowledge: The Production Process of Cartoons</h3>
<p>— Qintian</p>
<p>Ten thousand consecutive drawings are shown in only six minutes Sixteen drawings represent one step of Mickey Mouse</p>
<p>Walt Disney, the creator of the extremely popular Mickey Mouse cartoon in Hollywood, has recently founded a large-scale company in Hollywood. The sole purpose of this company is to produce cartoon films.</p>
<p>A very short cartoon, shown on the screen for only six minutes, requires ten thousand consecutive drawings. Each drawing, the image moves slightly, sixteen small drawings can represent Mickey Mouse taking a step, the first, eighth or sixteenth shows the mouse in action, the intermediate daytime film is just the formation of this action.</p>
<p>Regarding the drawing, originally drawn in pencil on white paper, later changed to pen, and then the back of the transparent paper is coated with black and white or gray-white colloid, so that the lines are drawn on, the image can be displayed. If it is a color film, then probably use color to replace the gray and white primer. Each drawing is carefully marked with a number, so as not to make mistakes.</p>
<p>One sheet represents Mickey Mouse's body, another sheet represents Mickey Mouse's hands, feet, and legs. Connected in this way, sometimes the body can be spared. First, the person in charge drafts the sample, pointing out the same action drawings to replace, so that in terms of time, it can certainly save a lot. If Mickey Mouse's hand is to be tightly gripped, it has already been pointed out on the sample, perhaps hundreds of them are the same.</p>
<p>If the Mickey Mouse cartoon is a sound film, it must also be dubbed after the drawing is completed. Mickey Mouse's movements must fully match the rhythm of the sound, this work is also very troublesome, it takes a lot of thought.</p>
<h3>Talking about Cheng Yanqiu (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Guo Duo</p>
<p>We have seen many articles discussing Cheng Yanqiu, but opinions vary, each with their own understanding. I dare not say that other people's understanding is wrong, but I feel that their understanding is not thorough enough. Therefore, I will discuss it again.</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu's singing: singing includes both voice and singing method. Voice mostly relies on talent, while singing method depends entirely on hard work. Many people say that Cheng Yanqiu's voice is not as high as Mei Lanfang's, because Yanqiu's Xipi opera sings in the six-and-a-half tone, and the Erhuang opera sings in the climbing half-tone, while Lanfang's Xipi opera sings in the orthodox tone, and the Erhuang opera sings in the six-and-a-half tone, which seems correct. But we often hear Yanqiu singing opera, when he sings to a high-pitched passage, we only feel that his singing voice goes straight into the clouds, lingering for three days without end! Not to mention Lanfang, even Chen Delin and Shang Xiaoyun are not as loud, what is the reason for this? In my humble opinion, I think this is because Yanqiu's voice is broad. Because his voice is broad, so his pronunciation is loud; although the tone is not high, singing it is not lower than usual.</p>
<p>Yanqiu knew his innate special voice, so he thought of a special singing method to suit his talent, so there was the creation of the so-called "Cheng tune". The characteristics of Cheng's tune are many, flipping high and low, intonation, is an important one. When flipping high, it is like the roar of a sea wave, when going low, it is like the floating of soft silk. The listener is suddenly thrilled, and suddenly fascinated. Even friends who usually like to watch but not listen, their spirits will immediately be excited after listening to such a singing tune.

<h3>New Film Introduction: Spring Madness</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>“Spring Madness”</p>
<p>I remember in an aviation film starring Clark Gable, because his lover did not allow him to engage in dangerous sky flight, this brave and stalwart man "tenderly" threw himself into his lover's arms. In "Spring Madness", the college student Sam also gave up his trip to the Soviet Union to pursue love with the girl Alice. This is the specialty of Hollywood playwrights: love, love, love, putting the country and career behind.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the male students in "Spring Madness" have become well-fed and idle through the playwright's love-supremacy, except for talking about love. What about those female students? When dancing with a male cadre, they didn't even know he was a professor, and asked for his name. Perhaps this is a "gimmick" to elicit laughter from the audience, but I laughed very unnaturally. Walking out of the theater, I met a friend who had studied in the United States, and he said: "Very interesting! This is indeed the case in the United States!" I couldn't help but be stunned for a long time.</p>
<p>The director naturally also tried his best to create jokes on these male and female college students. That Lippincott wrote such an "interesting" character, is a good example. And the famous publishers, police chiefs, and college professors are willing to be manipulated by the "women's army", which is another example.</p>
<p>Maureen O'Sullivan doesn't have many scenes. But in a scene with Louis-Alice in the gym, wearing a parallel bar rack back and forth, the little girl's thoughts were transmitted in twists and turns, and several shots of crying back in the bedroom were performed very movingly. And in the light and dark light, she lifted her skirt and swirled, and the clock pulled in the center of the parallel bar rack, the photography is very beautiful.</p>
<p>The Torrent Drama Society originally scheduled to hold its first Sunday performance from the twenty-second of this month, but due to procedural reasons, it was postponed to ten o'clock in the morning on the twenty-ninth of this month, and it will still be officially performed at the Lapei Grand Theater. As for the script, it is still "Rice Merchant" written by Zhiyin—formerly named Rice—(directed by Wang Zhuyou) and "The Flower of the Passerby" translated by Ba Jin from Amicis's original work (directed by Zheng Zhong). The stage supervisor is Chuan William, and there is Chen Gexin's string orchestra accompaniment. It is also heard that all the coupons issued on the twenty-second are universal.</p>
<p>Xu Muyun's "Pear Garden Movie Affairs", edited by Xu Muyun, is the most perfect book for studying drama, with 300 photos of famous actors from ancient and modern times, dozens of kinds of colorful drama photos and facial makeup, and the text is no less than 100,000 words. It cost a lot of money, so it is extremely exquisite. Last month, 200 copies of Yu Shu were sold cheaply at the Nanxiaoxing Bookstore on Henan Road, Simalu, priced at eight yuan, now only sold for three yuan, the sale will be closed after the sale.</p>
<p>Du Ao's Fan Service Agency, entrusted by various stars, sends signed photos on behalf of the stars, collecting one corner for printing and mailing costs per photo, and sending them to Shanghai Post Office Box 2020.</p>
<p>Errata: In the fourth section of yesterday's Yu Mansion Hall, line 13, the "Mao" in "Mao Shang" was misprinted as the rabbit, which should be corrected immediately.</p>
<h3>New Soviet Film: "The White-Clad Princess"</h3>
<p>Pushkin's works, translated into Chinese, have been numerous over the years, and many of his story poems have also been translated, such as "The Story of the Fish and the Fisherman," which is relatively famous. His longest fairy tale poem, perhaps because it has thousands of sentences, has not yet appeared in Chinese translation until now. The original name of this poem is "Ruslan and Ludmila", which writes about the deeds of the King of Kiev in ancient Russia, mixed with many legends of wild old men of the past dynasties, rendering it strangely. This long poem was adapted into an opera by Glinka, a great composer of Pushkin's era, and was first performed in St. Petersburg in 1842. This opera is also on the program of this year's Soviet Drama Festival.</p>
<p>Last year, the Moscow Film Factory in the Soviet Union also put this fairy tale poem known to Russian women and children on the screen, and many scenes of gods and monsters were filmed with new techniques. If it is said that this is a mythological film, it is certainly inappropriate, but it is worth seeing how the Soviet Union handles mythological themes. The film will be screened at Huguang from the 27th.</p>

<p>The "Hualian Cup" Xiangqi team inter-industry league organized by the Hualian Industry Association at No. 194 Nanjing Road has been in progress for a month since its start. It is heard that the results are very satisfactory, and the most vocal for the championship are Hualian, Lianyi Jia, and Yilin Yi in terms of teams; Wu Chuanqi, Chen Rongtang, and Shi Wenhua in terms of captains; Huang Jingen and Chuan Gaoshun in terms of individuals; Zhongchu and Xianshi in terms of industries; Cai Yifei in terms of captains; and Yu Shidang and Zhang Shiying in terms of individuals.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The issue of gold and silver in the Ulongyuan play</p>
<p>According to the old words, it is "This is a gold ingot, let me take it," and there is no mention of buying candy. Although it is a bit abrupt, it is not against the reason, and it will not lead to raw gold. Dan said silver, at the same time and place, actually put two different names on the same thing. There is also a layer, at the end, Song Jiang killed Mrs. Yan, and Yan Po哀告道 said: "Look at the old man's share and reward him with a coffin." 生白: "This has ten taels of silver, you go to do it." The audience should not misunderstand, how could Song Jiang just take out the gold letter from Po Xi's arms, put it in his arms, and then take it out and hand it to Yan Po, it becomes ten taels of silver? If you really think like this, then it can be screwed up. Because Chinese opera is symbolic, the person who is on the front stage takes the fake gold ingot, and when it comes to the appropriate point in the play, they only know to secretly hand it to the people in the play. Gold is also it, silver is also it, more is also it, less is also it, handed back and forth, it is this one, as for calling it gold or silver, or making the weight heavy or light, it all depends on the singing and reciting words in the play to determine its value. The audience must understand this layer, and they can know that Song Sanye will never not bring even a ten tael silver ingot. If he really went out like a loser, and intended to eat and drink for free, then he would not be 人　 for timely rain or righteous Song Jiang. It can be seen from this that what was taken out later was not the gold ingot that was stuffed into his arms before. Then the Sheng character first recites gold, and here again says silver, which is really different from the Dan character's clearly using gold as silver, so this cannot be said to be the Sheng character's fault. Chinese opera is really too tortuous, even if there is an instruction manual, sometimes the audience does not understand it, so I put forward the above points, which can be regarded as supplementing the shortcomings of the instruction manual.
