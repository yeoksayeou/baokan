<h3>日本進行反英運動　克萊琪提出强硬抗議　東京圓桌會議恐難以繼續　英美法三國保持密切接觸　英下院議員質問談判實情</h3>
<p>（倫敦）下議院本日午後開會時、反對派工黨議員漢德森與倍克曾就東京談判進行情形提出詢問、張伯倫首相當卽答稱、「東京談判進行情形、業由外務部决官勃特勒於星期一日向下議院提出報告、迄今並無變化、關於華北反英示威運動、政府已飭令駐日大使克萊琪爵士、向日本政府再度提出强硬抗議、」漢德森又問「遠東時局情形如斯、未知政府是吾與美法兩國政府最密切相聯絡、」張伯倫首相又答曰「然、」至是倍克乃就程錫庚案、華籍嫌疑犯四名引渡問題提出詢問、首相又答稱、此事尚未作何決定、工黨議員威治伍特乃云、「吾國所有舉動、凡有背棄中國之嫌者、卽可在中國境內、引起反英運動、未知首相能牢記此層否、」首相未予置答、自由黨議員曼德則提出詢問云、「天津方面、聞有英國婦女二人被日本人勒令褫去衣服加以檢查、未知政府何以處之、」首相又答稱、「關於此層余尚未接獲正式報告、」（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）下議院本日午後開會時、反對派工黨議員貝倫傑提出詢問云、東京談判涉及中國法幣問題吾、外務部决官白特勒當卽答曰、「吾、現行談判係以天津地方問題為限、」貝倫傑旋又追問、「首相能吾提供保證、聲明英國當局決不聽任中國法幣在天津租界內失去法律地位、」張伯倫首相乃答稱、「此事已於日昨詳細說明、」反對派工黨議員培克詢問、「外間盛傳英國擬在天津撤銷中國法幣在法律上所處地位、並將租界內存銀移交日方、未知日方是吾提出此項建議、首相能有所說明吾、」張伯倫首相又答稱、「此際謠誡繁興、隨時隨地均有之、未可輕予置信、下議院日昨討論中國時局時、余已充分說明英國政府立塲、此外無所增益、」（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）外决白特勒今日在下院宣稱、駐日英大使克萊琪爵士因日本海陸軍當局對揚子江三角洲英人之貿易作種種取締、特於六月六日致文日政府、交涉此案、迄今尙未接日政府覆文、英政府鹽於該問題異常急迫、已請克萊琪爵士催促日政府速予答覆矣、（二日路透電）</p>
<h3>克萊琪聲明英方觀點</h3>
<p>（倫敦）路透社外交訪員稱、倫敦目前尚未有因日方統制區域皆發生反英運動事、擬即終止東京談話之表示、惟英政府深知反英運動已使英日談判極感困難、駐日大使克萊琪已將此點向日政府明白言之、如不能成立和諧空氣、則談判之成功顯將受其妨碍、聞克萊琪於表明英方意見時、會作下列之聲明、日方在其所佔領區域內、已負維持公共秩序之責、而東京談話所議定之方案、亦以日方將負此責爲根據、乃現狀表明公共秩序並未維持就此觀之、日政府似不能或不欲維持公共秩序也、如其能維持之而不爲、則日方是不履行此方案之義務、如不能維持之、則日方不應作力能維持之表示、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）關於日日新聞所載、英國駐日大使克萊琪爵士、要求圓桌會議日方代表加籐、轉請日政府嚴厲制止在中國與日本之反英運動一說、外務省發言人今日加以吾認、謂日日新聞此訊、純屬揑造云、據英方消息、克萊琪近確因反英鼓噪、提出交涉、但克氏昨晚與加籐談話時、並未言及此事、日外務省發言人又稱、英相張伯倫所稱、在華北作反英鼓噪者、乃在日人勢力下、受日人唆使與控制之人一節、並非事實云、按張伯倫昨在下院所發之言論、已被禁止在日發表、日本各報朱予刊載、（二日路透電）</p>
<h3>美代辦亦曾向日抗議</h3>
<p>（東京）據日日新聞載稱英大使克萊琪爵士、昨晚曾向圓桌會議日代表團領袖加藤提出要求、請日政府嚴厲制止在華之反英運動、並謂「如其不然、則英日談話或將難以繼續云、聞英大使更請求將此意轉達有田外相云、該報又稱、同時美國駐日代辦杜曼曾訪晤外務省美洲事務局長、說明在華之反英運動、現已轉變成爲反對白種人之活動、危害中國之美國僑民、要求日政府對於在華之排外運動、予以充分之制止云、據該報所載、加藤氏曾答覆英大使云反英活動與東京談話、乃截然兩事、日本國內之反英活動、係出諸民衆之自動、如其妨碍和平與秩序之維持、則負責之日本官吏、自將隨時予以適當之取締、至於中國之民衆活動、則與日政府無關、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）據此間報告稱、英美兩國爲日本鼓動在日及在華之反英運動、均向日本政府提出抗議、日日新聞載、克萊琪大使通告日本政府稱、在現有之情勢下英國勢難與日本繼續談判、並稱日本政府具有制止反英運動之權力、豈可予以縱容、日方答稱、反英運動與東京談判不可混爲一談、反英示威運動乃係人民意志之自然的表現、除非行動逾軌、干犯法紀、日本政府不能制止之、美國之抗議稱、日本之反英運動、具有與白種爲雛之用意、因之、居於中國之美國人、備受犧牲、深盼日本制止攻擊外國人之行動、此間政界人士對於英美採取共同之行動、顯寓示威之意、深覺憤懣、（二日海通電）</p>
<h3>英對經濟問題不讓步</h3>
<p>（東京）朝日新聞稱、經濟問題小組委員會之英代表、昨已承認天津存銀之歷史上背景、與華北經濟之特殊性質、如外匯之集中於聯準銀行所表示者、上述各情、已由雙方互換文件申明之、但英代表現猶抱堅强態度、以爲經濟問題、與美法等國皆有嚴重影響不僅英國而已、故對於日方要求毫無依允之象、且以爲如依允之則無異吾認中政府而承認「臨時政府」也、觀於英方態度之頑固、日代表欲在圓桌會議中進行經濟問題之討論、殆屬無益、於此唯有由英大使克萊琪與日方總代表加藤先作私人談話、以佈置圓桌會議進行之途徑耳、是以圓桌會議今日不能舉行、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）路透社外交訪員探悉讓渡天津英租界華方白銀事東京曾談中雖已提及、但日政府迄今未作是項要求、若有此要求、則英政府將與其他有關各國政府商榷、如張伯倫星期一日在下院所言者然、今談判之進展雖隨時詳細通知法美兩國政府、但並未舉行此種商榷、預料英政府日內將以訓令致克萊琪大使、（一日路透電）</p>
<h3>英報評論津存銀問題</h3>
<p>（倫敦）遠東局勢繼續爲倫敦及各地方報紙特別注意之材料、伯明罕郵報載稱、中國法幣問題、其他各國實與英國有同樣重要之關係、日政府雖認之爲地方事件、吾人倘亦作如此觀念、則此問題即將成爲「極闊的楔子之薄錄」矣、如此事成爲東京談判中之主要問題、則無疑將以切實之形式提交其他各國政府、但在目下主要之爭點、似爲較有限制性質的天津英租界存銀問題、同時外傳英政府擬將引起天津事件之四華人引渡於日方之說、亦能予以吾認、目下並無任何决定、且亦不擬在最近之將來計議及之也云、新聞紀事報亦發表同樣鄭重之言論、每日民聲報外交訪員、對於承認中國傀儡政府及貨幣問題發表議論云、東京談判已明白遭遇頓挫、法國駐日大使亨利、曾通知日外相有田、謂法政府對於此項問題、極爲重視、如舉行談判、必須有法代表一人列席云、倫敦官塲對於日方所傳英政府已同意讓渡天津英租界各銀行所存中央政府白銀之消息、巳堅决予以吾認、據泰晤士報東京訪員聲稱、關於此項白銀問題之歷史方面、日方竟稱此項存銀、並不屬於中政府而係前北平地方政府所有、因目下北平政府、已由日人卵翼下之新政權繼位、此項存銀在法理上自應歸新「政府」所有云、據路透社消息、倫敦華人各界對於貨幣或白銀問題、均不感嚴重之煩擾、（二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>日外藏兩相交換意見</h3>
<p>（東京）英國駐日太使克萊琪與日方特使加藤外松、今日午後四時四十五分至六時十分曾在東京俱樂部中會見、同時日外相有田·外决澤田·藏相石渡·藏决大野·亦會於今日集會交換關於天津各項經濟問題之意見、關於日方要求英方禁止中國法幣在天津租界流行並將英國銀行手中之中國白銀交出二問題、日方認爲克萊琪必須獲得本國政府之訓令後、始能有所表示（二日美聯電）</p>
<h3>警務組委員會昨開會</h3>
<p>（東京）今日除關於討論天津警務之小組委員會開會外、別無其他會議、據云係因摘錄過去各决會議之紀錄、故有此必要云、同時日本各報均謂英國對於法幣及存銀問題、現抱一種難以理喻之强項態度、顯然不顧有田克萊琪協定之原則云、各報又對於「英國所特長」之「巧妙」政策、企圖以聯合美國威脅日本、喚起注意、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）駐日英大使館參贊陶德、今晨十一時訪問日外務省東亞局長栗原、談半小時、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）加藤公使與克萊琪英大使、二日午後四時四十五分、會見於東京俱樂部、協議日英會談今後進行方式、至六時十分會談完畢、（二日同盟社電）</p>
<h3>張彭春自美飛英　追述美國廢約情形　行前曾與美國務卿長談</h3>
<p>（倫敦）中國大學教授及人民參政會會員張彭春氏、今日乘楊基飛剪號飛機由紐的抵英、爲華人飛渡大西洋之第一人、張氏語往訪之路透社訪員云、渠此决行程僅因飛剪號在紐芬蘭停留一日、稍有延擱、渠初未十分深信美國之廢止美日商的或將證明爲戰事之轉捩點、張氏離美前、會與美國務卿赫爾作長時問之晤談、羅斯福總統因政務過忙、無暇接見、但由赫爾轉交一函、內稱「余知君有佳音携來美國、甚感愉快」云、張氏叉語路透社訪員云、渠由美啟程前之最後一刻、心緒極爲不寗、其時美參院外交委員會正討論參議員樊登堡氏贊成廢止美日條的之決議、但有若干人士表示反對、結果如何尚未决定、至傍晚時、始知大多數贊成廢的、於是羅斯福總統乃決定行動、廢約之通告即於當晚公布、此事雖有以上之經過、但一般人仍認之爲奇突、英大使至翌晨始知此事云、張氏續稱、美國廢的之主要原因有二、（一）美政府願竭力避免實際激成戰爭致使和平遭受打擊、並對各獨裁者下直截之警告、（二）美政府欲藉此表示美國人民對於日本侵略中國之情緒、按張氏最近數月來、曾遍遊美國各地、據渠觀察所得、美國大多數人民、贊成對日採取行動之傾向、已無疑與日俱進、據稱廢的之舉、巴博得各派報紙一致之歡迎、羅斯福總統顯然已成就一件大獲人心之事矣、張氏又稱美國對於此决廢的、自然極爲愼重、目下有一極堪注意之特點、即各官員均嚴守絨默是、渠上次在美時、美國官方皆紛紛討論中國戰事之各方面情形、現時彼等已決定行動、而不復再願空談矣、張氏又稱、美政府之專門家、現正硏究關於廢的事之二點、（一）爲續向日本購買余銀問題、日本欲藉此補救其由美國購辦原料之入超、（二）爲日本輸至美國各貨之關稅問題、例如布匹生絲之類、張氏末稱、渠意美國之廢的其意義實係邀請英國作同樣之行動、倘英國在逮東方面不能採取堅決之態度、美國自將極感失望、（二日路透電）</p>
<h3>郭大使向英提出　備忘錄　關於存銀問題　重申政府態度</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據的克夏日報政治訪員稱、中國駐英大使郭泰祺曾奉國民政府之訓令、以備忘錄一件送達英國外務部、該文首先提出天津租界內之存銀問題、華人存銀於天津英法銀行之數甚巨、値八十萬英鎊之多、英國政府前曾申明、東京談判之範圍、不擬超出天津英租界被封鎖之問題以及有關事件之外、是以英日談判若討論存銀移交問題、則顯然溢出範國、難辭食言之咎、該訪員又稱、昨晚郭太使於送交備忘錄之時、曾與外相哈里法克斯晤談、重申中國政府之態度、外相保證英國政府决計尊重關於幣制問題之中國的權益、聞郭大使致送之備忘錄內、對於英國承認在華之日軍、由於維持秩序、及保障自身之安全、具有某種利權一點、訏擊最為嚴厲、中國認為日軍盤踞中國領土之內、乃係違犯神聖之條約、决無可貨之稅、（二日海通電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>新中國經濟建設運動</h3>
<p>中國於過去二十五個月戰爭中經濟的發展，已在歷史上創一新紀元：戰前中國的經濟情形，大概以近海區域爲較繁榮，而內地則多呈貧困的現象；戰事發生後，近海區域的經濟組織雖被砲火所毀壞，而經濟的重心都逐漸移往內地，內地已因此由貧困一變而爲繁榮，由純農業生產而漸進入工業化的階段，於是內地的經濟活動，一方面支持着戰爭期內巨大財力的消耗；一方面負担着各種建設的任務，其力量的偉大，發展的迅速，實非任何人所能估計。</p>
<p>內地經濟的發展情形如何，現在政府尚未能作具體詳細的報告；但就各種零星材料加以攷察，大可窺見其活動狀况的一般。先就交通言：西北西南的交通，向稱落後；今則陸路方面，公路有如蛛綱分佈，其中西北公路與滇緬公路，已成爲國際的幹綫，據估計在過去兩年中，西南新築公路長達七千五百英里。鐵路的建築，西南除舊有滇越鐵路外，尚有叙昆·滇緬·成渝·湘桂·湘黔·滇黔·川黔·川康等鐵路，或已通車，或尚在進行中；西北近已完成蒙蘇鐵路；正在計劃或建築中的，尚有隴新·包甯·寳成·寳蘭等路。空中交通已與英法蘇相互連絡。再就工業言：從前被目爲荒蕪的內地，現隨地可聞機器軋軋聲。例如古老的重慶，現已成爲新興的工業都市。據中國國民經濟研究所的調查，在最近兩年內，川黔滇三省新創的工業其資本在二萬元以上的，已有四百七十二個工廠。就農業言：政府近來致力於農業技術的改革，和農業的貸款。據經濟部報告，年來農業產品，已較前大有增加。例如陝西的麥，去年已較前年增加一千二百萬担；四川的棉，去年的增加九十餘萬担。就礦業言：西北西南的地下，藏有各種大量的資源，現在政府還在着手開發。如西康的金，四川陜西的石油和煤，都在實際開採中。就商業言：由於政府的合法管理，如物價的平衡，運輸產銷的調劑，以及輸出入的統制，致國外貿易在政府統制的各海關下，已成爲順差的出超；同時國內貿易也隨着國內各業的興盛而日趨繁榮。中國的內地乃是蘊藏最豐富的寳庫，過去因種種關係而爲國人所忽視；現在因抗戰而得儘量開發，這未始不是中華民族的因禍得福的一種生機。蔣總裁日昨在接見外報記者時，曾聲稱中國在軍事和經濟上，已可不賴外援而能單獨抗戰，可見整個經濟已有驚人的發展了！</p>
<p>在創造新中國的經濟建設運動中，進行最力的自然是主持抗戰建國大計的政府：她對於各種經濟的活動，屬於國營的，以繼續不斷的努力，謀獲最大的成就。今年政府爲專一從事經濟建設起見，發行了建設公債六萬萬元，作爲各種國營事業的基金；對於民營事業，以各種方法指導和鼓勵人民。例如政府爲發展工業起見，乃指導民衆從事工業合作運動，據傳在中國工業合作協會成立後的七個月中西北西南等地曾成立了三百多個工業合作社，幫助人民從事各種小型的工業。其次則爲全國人民的努力奮發，國外的華僑和各地的居民都儘量將資金移轉內地，各種科學技術人員也都不避犧牲而爲祖國效力。西南邊境瘴氣遍佈，素來被人視爲畏途，現在已有不少的實業家和科學家去考察調查，這種愛國的精神，是不下於衝鋒陷隈的戰士的。此外國際的援助，也是一重大的推動力。許多重要交通工烽的建設，都依賴友邦的投資；而中英庚款會帮助中國政府考察邊疆各地資源，培植各種技術人才，尤具有不可磨滅的功績。</p>
<p>現在祗有淪陷區域一部分人民，對於這個全民族所推動的新經濟建設運動，似乎還未盡其全力；他們或是把資金逃避到租界，從事各種投機事業；或是逃避到國外，以求未來的安全；或是將生產事業暫時停頓，以期和平的迅速恢復。他們不把有用的資金，帮助政府從事建國運動，這對國家未免是一種損失；就以目前利害關係來說，淪陷區域的一切經濟活動，不僅是沒有發展的機會，而且反有極重大的危險。日本對全部中國海岸的封鎖，勢將斷絕歐美對華的貿易；中國政府爲防止資敵，對於淪陷區域也必將加强經濟的隔離。如淪陷區域與國內外的經濟關係斷絕，那裏還有什麼生路可言！何况淪陷區域的各種經濟的活動，完全已在他人統制之下。例如工業便用所謂「合作」的名義，已無異於將資產奉送於人；而農業產品的收購運銷，更脫不了所謂「統制」的壓迫，據報載綏遠已被强迫栽種雅片，藉以抽取苛稅，使農民蒙受重大損失，便是顯明的例證。至於交通有關軍運，全受統制，那是更不必說了。總之在現時新中國抗戰建國的進程中，淪陷區域的人民欲求自救，首先當救自己的國家，拿自己的血汗，來推動新中國的經濟建設運動。這在上海這樣一個遊資集中的特殊環境，富有財力的人更應起來設法促進，那實際效果的收穫，是可操左劵的。</p>

<h3>西南旅行實錄</h3>
<p>— 蔚然</p>
<p>（一）從香港到海防</p>
<p>自從廣州灣和北海的公路陸續破壞、繼之溫·汕·各綫、時緊時馳不甚暢達以後、西南諸省的交通路、便祇剩假道海防一條、由上海到海防、原有兩種方法可循、一是在上海先行辦好過境護照、乘怡和或太古的滬防直航輪去、前者需時十天、後者的半個月、一是到香港去辦理護照、再乘港防輪前往以費用而論、上面一種較省、時間則相反、因爲在上海辦理護照、有時需一個月以上、在香港至多不過一星期、</p>
<p>在香港辦理過境護照的手續很簡單、到達後、可即至外交部駐港簽證專員辦事處（在東方匯理銀行樓上）索取聲請書照塡、由在港有固定職業人士担保、隨繳港幣六元和照片三張、兩天後、即可領取護照、不過要親自簽收、接着、可辦理法領事的加簽手續、照他們的規定、收件祇限上午十時至十二時、過了便不能通融、所以取得護照後、須立即到領事館購取加簽聲請書、（每張一角）經商店担保、再由與這商店有往來的銀行簽字保證、手續方稱齊備、繳入時、附照片一張和聲請費港幣一元、大的在送入後第三天的下午、便可簽出、所以要是沒有什麼意外阻碍的話、一星期總够辦從香港到海防的船公司、有怡和·太古·和法郵各家、大的每三天有一條開行、其中噸位、以怡和各輪最大、（的三千餘噸）法郵各輪最小、（的一千餘噸）設備大致相仿、時間上頗有差別、如太古因兼灣廣州灣·北海、需時五天以上、怡和去程係直放、需需四十八小時、回程灣北海、的需三天、法郵係直放、號稱四十小時、實際上也需兩天、不過各輪均以裝貨爲主要業務、開駛日期、不很準確、竟有延遲三四天的、</p>
<p>（二）海防的海關</p>
<p>提起海防的海關、取道安南過境的旅容、都認爲是極頭痛的事、我們在滬港各處曾聽到過幾種可怖的傳說、如旅客一到岸、便得在黑房子裏關上幾小時、每一件行李、都要兜底倒出、一根火柴要罰一塊錢等等、使我們一踏上海防的碼頭、便感極度不安、可是經過檢騐手續以後、覺得除主事者的盛氣凌人以外、並不如傳說之甚、不過事前的凖備、非常重要、允其是海防沒有熟人來迎接的話、否則即使不受上述各種離奇痛苦、小損失是在所難免的、（未完）</p>

<h3>蔣總裁談　中國能獨力抗戰　軍事經濟不需外國供給　日軍撤離中國始言和平</h3>
<p>海通社總理返滬述謁蔣情形</p>
<p>海通社遠東總經理美最時月前赴重慶·香港、視察社務、頃已回抵上海、美君在重慶時、曾晋謁蔣介石上將·孔祥熙院長·暨其他政府要人、進行私人性質之談話、美最時於歸途中、曾往昆明一遊、觀光當地情形</p>
<h3>中國力能單獨抗戰</h3>
<p>據美最時君談在渝時、蔣委員長曾個別加以接見、舉行一小時之談話、蔣氏曾向之申稱、中國今日幾已可以完全不賴外國供給　在軍事上及經濟上單獨抵抗日本至不固定之時期、同時在日軍退出中國之前、絕無和平可言、任何第三國離開此種基礎之調停提議、均爲中國所決難接受、</p>
<h3>中德關係極可滿意</h3>
<p>據美君稱、蔣氏儀表莊嚴、態度和靄、對於向之提出之問題、異常敏銳、同時對各種方面之事件、均表注意、並自行提出若干問題、蔣氏對中德關係、極表注意、認爲一般而論甚可滿意、</p>
<h3>中國人民團結一致</h3>
<p>蔣氏論及國共兩黨之問題時、堅決宣稱、「中國並無共產黨徒、現時所稱之共產黨、絕非歐洲所謂之共產黨、中國人民、爲協助全國抵抗、已經一致團結、至於中蘇合作、不過兩個友邦之關係、決非表示中國依附蘇俄信仰、」</p>
<h3>經濟方面自足自給</h3>
<p>蔣氏繼論及中國在軍事上及經濟上之後備力量、以異常自信之口吻告美君日、中國在軍事上及經濟上、已經可以不仰給外國之進口、單獨抵抗日本至不固定之時期、經濟方面、中國已經大部份自足自給、</p>
<h3>四川幅員與德國等</h3>
<p>上海香港之隔斷、適足以增進中國之地位、蓋中國雖無若干物品、已知如何繼續前進、同時不必需之物品、則可因之免其入口矣、今日全國已成爲農業機構、不畏空襲之</p>
<h3>北江西路封鎖缺口　日兵已撤</h3>
<p>惟仍加佈障礙物</p>
<p>居民遷徙猶未已</p>
<p>北江西路南起自來水橋北堍、北迄老靶子路東端一帶商店住戶以及里衖、自上月二十九日起、突被日方以木桿及有刺鐵絲攔架後、情勢頓趨緊張被圍居民、亦紛紛向租界中區遷徙、惟自前日起</p>
<p>封鎖缺口處之日兵、已大為减少、故情形相當鬆弛、昨晨大通社記者再往巡歷、除崇明路口之封鎖缺口、仍留日兵崗位一名駐守外、文監師路口及海寗路口之兩封鎖缺口之日兵</p>
<p>崗哨已撤僅有華捕數名、留守於鐵絲綱外圍、北江西路自老靶子路至海寗路一段、有日兵十餘人、正在封鎖處加佈鐵絲、似以前所攔架者</p>
<p>尙欠週密北江西路海寗路東首露天防疫處、仍在予願留居該區域內者注射防疫針、觀乎上項情形、日方顯將以新佈鐵絲綱區為其管轄範圍、惟事態已趨和綏、但遷徙情况、並不稍殺、</p>
<h3>廣西發行六厘公債　八百萬元</h3>
<p>限定十二年</p>
<p>營業稅為基金</p>
<p>廣西省政府爲調整二十八年度省庫收支、發行民國二十八年廣西省六厘公債八百萬元、利率定爲年息六厘、期限十二年、自民國二十九年起至民國四十年四月三十日全數還淸、指定該省營業稅收入爲基金、由財政部審計部廣西省政府及財政廳、各派代表一人、關係銀行推代表一人、組織基金保管委會、威脅、此外政府現正積極開發各省、以四川一省而論、其幅員與德國相等、其開發之可能、正未可限量、</p>
<h3>日軍全撤始言和平</h3>
<p>最後蔣氏提及和平問題、力言「日軍一日在中國領土、則一日無和平希望、中國今日抗戰之目的、在驅逐日本軍隊、此項目的達到之前、中國政府決不考慮任何和平談判、至於調停、如不依據上述基礎、亦決不爲中國所接受」、</p>
<h3>美商務參贊安諾德　暢游西南返滬</h3>
<p>發現重慶民氣甚高</p>
<p>對防空壕贊揚備至</p>
<p>大陸報云、美國駐華商務參贊安諾德、前返美留居年餘、五月間來華、遨遊西南部、在重慶盤桓一週、然後赴香港、昨日（一日）午後搭柯立芝總統號輪返抵滬濱、</p>
<h3>孤立潮流確已消滅</h3>
<p>據談、美國輿情今呈一定形態之象、美國人民現益關切遠東事件、明瞭美國在東方之權利、須加尊重、雖美國堅其「吾人不欲戰」之感覺、然美國孤立主義之潮流、確已消滅、一般人較前益望更詳知世界事件之眞相、</p>
<h3>重慶民氣極堪贊許</h3>
<p>安氏轉談遠東、稱渠在四川見中國將其長江流域之實業移入川省、雖有戰事、而今進行實業工作甚著成效、渠對此事、所得印象最深、渠發現重慶民氣甚高、並贊揚已造成之防空壕與火街、謂重慶且將建造更巨大而優良之防空壕、內裝空氣調節、優美之奏樂臺、電炬、及現代之鉛管類設備、直可稱之謂夜總會、</p>
<h3>滇緬公路足敷重載</h3>
<p>安氏留渝時、雖未遇空襲、惟稱前此日方之轟炸、顯然甚少損壞、居民頗形鎭靜、以整個而言、渝市在順利進行中、安氏留中國之戰時首都時、當謁交通部長張嘉璈、安氏稱、中國運輸便利之工作、刻正以努力到底之狀態向前邁進中、滇緬公路已證明爲重要之「　門」該路甚佳、每日至少載運貨物百噸、雖受雨水挫折、但運輸不爲所阻云、</p>
<h3>安氏榮膺博士學位</h3>
<p>安氏與記者談畢，即可甫抵海關碼頭之美亞洲艦隊卸任總司令雅納爾大將及其夫人道別、按安氏於去年二月間離滬赴美、作長期休假、留美期間、得加州波摩那大學贈予法學博士名譽學位、</p>
<h3>青浦客車折回</h3>
<p>據交通界消息、昨日由滬開往靑浦之客車、駛至途中被阻折回、據傳滬靑公路一帶、有戰事發生、公路遭破壞、現滬靑問汽車爲避免危險、已停止開航、</p>
<h3>東戰塲華軍　奉命開始出動</h3>
<p>訓練完成安抵目的地</p>
<p>布置竣事戰局即揭開</p>
<p>滬郊各地僅有小接觸</p>
<p>東戰塲運動戰現有展開模樣、關於京滬綫一帶之華軍、由國府積極規劃、並經過新戰略嚴格訓練後、實力至為雄厚、先遣部隊、業已越過日軍警戒綫、而進抵滬郊、浦東方面、由游擊隊進攻、正規軍協助、亦已發動、各情如次</p>
<p>京滬華軍</p>
<p>担任蘇南京　錢之反攻華軍、自經東戰塲最高軍事當局重行改編、畀予新命、將原駐沿綫各縣部隊、分批調往××地、施以各項新戰術之嚴格訓練後、即遣回原防、再依次調往受訓、八閱月以來、各縣部隊、悉已調練竣事、計每縣受訓之華軍、平均的四千人至五千人、其中除原有分散之正規軍外、靑年學生·就地壯丁·及農民等參加者、佔百分之六十以上、現各地華軍、已奉最高當局命令、開始沿京滬綫出動、向日軍防區內長驅挺進、據甫由常州紅無錫·崑山來滬之客商談、該項華軍軍容甚整、年齡均在四十歲以下之壯丁及靑年、所到各處、秋毫無犯、各地民衆、莫小懽勝萬狀、</p>
<p>越警戒綫安抵滬郊</p>
<p>第一批先遺突擊隊、的二千五百飴人、番號爲江南抗日義勇軍、由梅克迪·朱壽華·任天石·分任司令、總指揮爲鄧本殷、一路循京滬綫之無錫·蘇州·崑山、折入公路綫而達靑沛、向滬靑公路進發、將抵達虹橋、一路由常熟·太倉·嘉定·而進抵寳山·江　·大塲·羅店·現悉該兩路之突盤隊、己越過沿鐵路公路之日軍警戒綫、安抵滬郊××地會集、且與松江·閔行·沛東各地之忠義救國軍取得聯絡、前日滬西中山路·日商豐田紗廠附近、亦有發現、旋引去</p>
<p>突過公路有遭遇戰</p>
<p>當是項突擊隊在越過崑靑公路時、曾與日僞軍發生遭遇戰、因該隊分路包抄、出奇襲擊、日僞軍死傷頗多、並繳獲槍械甚夥、自此役之後、日方非常恐慌、大事準備、且向沿公路一帶發砲濫施轟　、企圖阻止華軍前進、但該隊輒以聲東擊西方法、一面以稀落槍聲、誘惑日軍、一面則分路奇擊、致日軍無法應付、故近日滬郊一帶之砲聲、證實不虛、據一般觀察、東戰塲之反攻序幕、預料不久即將　　、</p>
<p>浦東戰事已趨活躍</p>
<p>浦東戰事業已全面揭開、擔任大團方面攻擊之部隊爲顧立峯、及閻增部、按照預定計劃、於二十六日午夜、即開始攻擊、準備位置、以二十八日晨五時入市、聞日軍廿餘名被擊斃、顧部某官長、並發現汽油船一艘、泊於河中、亟以火油柴草、縱火燃燒、未及一時、僅剩船壳、</p>
<p>南滙全境亦已發動</p>
<p>新　方面攻擊部隊、爲谷守信·吳振海部、於規定攻擊開始時問、着手進軍、現市外各要口均已佔領、並聞僞軍張妙根部、已全體反正、南匯方面、爲徐承德·黃鐵英·部與其他各地同時進攻、水陸交通、完全破壞、日軍因守城中、周浦一帶爲李文元及奚庚辛部、現在每晚用小鋼砲向鎭市襲擊、日軍固守不出、又據柘林來人談、柘林市橋方面、今晨砲聲極爲淸晰、</p>

<h3>復興公債本息　準本月底付款</h3>
<p>悉照統一辦法滬分六期　金長亦已定期抽籤還本</p>
<p>財政部對於關稅担保各內債、因稅收被截、停付本息後、國債基金管理委員會商請中中交農四行同意、對到期本息貼現付款、關於復興公債第七决本息、計本一百七十萬元、息九百八十九萬四元、總共一千一百五十九萬四千元、準八月三十一日起由中央銀行及其委託之中國·交通·兩銀行付款、辦法與統一公債相同、上海分六期付淸、以匯劃票付給之、又金融長期公債第十二决還本、已定九月十日在滬舉行抽籤、計還本一百十二萬五千元、連同息金四十萬零七千八百十二元五角、定九月三十日由中中交三行付款、辦法與統一復興完全相同、</p>

<p>法文上海日報云、聞法租界公董局行政總辦譚鴣啼及其夫人、將於三日趁芝萊茄納號郵船赴港、轉道返法休假、</p>
<h3>米市昨復混亂　米商企圖抬價</h3>
<p>做暗盤交易者什之七八　但米麵兩項積儲極充足</p>
<p>昨日米業市塲之公開市價、進達最高限價、同時行客號間之暗盤買賣、異常猖獗、最高價竟做開二十二元五角左右、計全市塲一百〇五家之中（除市塲管理委員會若干主持交易公道而負有執行限價使命之少數管理委員停止買賣外）、做暗盤交易者幾佔十分之七八、據大光社記者昨晨赴市塲調查、暗盤行市昨又激漲達六七角之鉅、且囤戶方面雖見價格拾高、而其在手之現貨、尚仍居奇觀望、冀圖再漲、咸皆不肯、脫售、市塲混亂狀態、已轉入上月中旬之局面、</p>
<p>謁陳當局</p>
<p>本市米案各團體於日內將再度推派代表、向公共和界工部局據實報告上海米市情形、並商榷食糧調節辦法、以維界內民食、據悉當局對於滬市食糧、已有詳細調查、除各棧房各行號存米的合四十萬包左右外、尚有數百萬包麵粉儲積、故滬市民食凖備充足、可無匱乏之虞、但望米商設法疏運產地來源、俾資調節、</p>
<p>公布存米</p>
<p>豆米行業公會辦理之各棧存米調查報告，業已竣事、定於今日下午四時發表、至於兩租界當局澈查各棧存米亦將公布、其數量上與豆米業之調查是吾相差、須待公布後方能明瞭、如查有溢出之存米，而未經列入報告者、則隱匿居奇、當局將斷然處置、</p>
<p>米商企圖</p>
<p>昨日市塲交易、除白元冬霜等米未有限價、仍有少數交易外、粳米交易絕無僅有、據上均在塲外私做暗盤、照限價的漲三兀五六角不等、據新新社記者探悉、米價上漲、完全爲投機操縱影響、蓋一部份米商對於工部局執行限價、雷厲風行、敢怒而不敢言、爲利慾所驅、私相受授、企圖抬高米價、以達牟利目的、</p>
<p>公會通告</p>
<p>上海市米號業同業公會再告全體同業云、敬啟者、本市米價、日漲無已、市塲最决白粳、均逾限價、暗盤叢生、無法制止、迭據會員報告、市塲上二十元與十六元限價之貨、無從購處、對於逾限之貨、欲購則爲違法、不買則無貨應市、店中存貨有限、轉瞬即將告罄、紛紛請求妥籌辦法等情前來、查現在市塲混亂情形、變本加厲、而暗盤越價、已成公開秘密、無法遏止、吾同業苟逾　購進、而門市則須遵守限價、是則越限購進、不但須受犧牲、抑且爲非法行爲、處境極端困難、爲再通告全體同業、切勿在市塲越限購進米糧、門售仍須嚴格遵守限價、不得稍有逾越、此事關於全市整個民食、租界常局、自有相當辦法處置、吾同業務須持以鎭靜、以待解決、是爲至禱、</p>
<h3>投糖菓糕餅　請求捐款救濟　情狀不無可疑</h3>
<p>昨日本埠滬西一帶、有形似工人者、挨戶投入一食品袋、裝有糖菓糕餅等物、又附印刷函件一通、內述請捐二三角以救濟失業者云云、居戶接到此項物件後、有詢投函者以眞正之動機何在、渠亦不能答復、掉首逕去、似該投函之形似工人初亦未悉此項舉動之原因也、</p>
<h3>沿海航業被攫　南洋航綫擴展</h3>
<p>外輪多已改駛暹羅各埠　新加坡小呂宋輪運發達</p>
<p>南華航綫各口岸、位於浙閩粤三省之沿海口岸、自汕頭陷落後、航業影饗至鉅、現下粤省海口、祇廣州灣·北海·海口·可通、但與內地交通、殊苦不便、閩省祇厦門一處，與內地隔絕、至興化·泉州兩地、外輪雖擬試航、恐難成功、如上月一日某英輪、由滬儎貨赴興泉後、迄今月餘、尚無返滬之消息、該輪客貨、已吾起卸、現尚不明、故對興泉航行問題、最近時期中、難以實現、昨報所載太古江蘇輪赴興化·泉州之說、係誤傳、浙江省之海口、現僅寗波、處、行駛各輪、營業平平、禮和洋行海福輪、亦擬加人航行、現正向當局申請中、</p>
<p>太古輪改　駛滬暹綫</p>
<p>南華航綫受此影響後、航商損失不貲、故央商太古公司即另謀別圖、除加駛廣州灣·海防航綫外、近又開關滬暹班、過去已有蘇州·張家口兩船赴暹、今又有第三輪貴陽號、定於本星期日（六日）自滬赴暹、經汕頭·香港·及土樂·西貢而至盤谷、該公司上月底又新闢新加坡綫、已由慶元輪於上月二十八日自滬開往、兼灣香港·廣州灣、第二輪赴新者、亦已派定新疆輪、於下星期一（八日）、由滬赴香港、直駛新加坡、</p>
<p>怡和等輪　改航計劃</p>
<p>一般外商航輪、因中國沿海遭遇威脅後、不得不謀新出路、向南洋發展、英商怡和洋行、亦在計割中、法租界大馬路洽成申行經理之英輪海格號、原定昨日開往香港、亦因欲向南洋發展起見、改於六日自滬赴香港、直放新加坡·庇能·仰光各處、外灘同益船務行經理之挪輪蘭地號、定六日直放香港、友力他號、定八日經香港赴新加坡·庇能等處、鴻運航務局經理美商福來公司之彼好爾號、定六日開往香港·小呂宋、</p>
<p>北洋航綫　景象慘淡</p>
<p>各外商輪船公司、紛紛向南洋闢新航錢、至北洋航綫、均被日輪奪取、最近又因水脚改收港幣、以致外輪貨運、異常消淡、據航業界謂、此種景象、爲中日戰事發生以來所未有、</p>
<p>溫州復航　傳已批准</p>
<p>關於溫州之復航問題、今溫台防守司令已予批准、惟日艦企圖封鎖阻止復航、並在甌江外佈雷封鎖、今英商怡隆公司之神光輪試航溫州、在溫口外爲日艦阻止駛入、於是被迫折回上海、定今日可返抵上海、外傳未蒙溫台防守司令之批准、實屬不確、此决之復航溫州未成、全爲日艦阻撓所致、</p>
<h3>部令各關嚴緝　私運錢鈔</h3>
<p>軍人及公務人員　均應受海關檢查財政部近電令各地海關云、關於海關查緝私運金銀鈔票、檢查旅客逾限携帶鈔票各任務、迭經通令各海關認眞辦理在案、茲再規定凡放客經由海關、無論軍人公務員以及商旅、應一律受海關檢查、以重功令、而杜弊端、除已請軍事委員會蔣委員長·行政院·分令各部隊官兵及軍用汽車隊各機關所屬職員一體遵照、暨通電各關外、仰即知照、並仰認眞執行檢查爲要、</p>
<h3>關棧六月份　提出貨物</h3>
<p>根據海關發表　共三百餘萬金</p>
<p>海關發表今年六月份提出關棧之貨物表、第一組九金、第二組二一·四四一金、第三組一五七金、第四組四·九二八金、第六組一·八一七金、第七組三·六一五金、第八組二三·四六九金、第九組二四七·五七五金、第十組一六一·〇九四金、第十一組五·九五八金、第十二組一一六·六六三金、第十三組一八·〇一七金、第十四組一四八金、第十五組一六·〇八五金、第十六組三三金、第十七組五·八一九金、第十八組二·八二三金、第十九組一二三·七〇七金、第二十組三四·〇八八金、第二十一組一五·七七九金、第二十二組一四一·〇八三金、第二十三組七七五·九〇二金、第二十四組一·五九三·一三三金、第二十五組四九·三二四金、第二十六組四〇八金、第二十七組一四〇金、第二十八組一·七三〇金、第二十九組四〇二金、第三十組一·六七〇金、第三十一組八三〇金、第三十二組二四·〇二三金、統共三·三九一·九八〇金、</p>
<h3>傳財部舉辦　管制國內匯兌</h3>
<p>限購日用必需品防法幣外流　沿海將實行滬市則更爲慎重</p>
<p>昨據電傳、財部已令飭中中交農四行、合組國內匯兌管理委員會、意在防止內地法幣外流、並統制國內匯兌業務、以購買日用必需品爲限、對上海允爲注意、凡欲匯款往沿海城市者、事前須向該會申請、且須商行證明、大的下星期可實行云云、大光社記者昨曾以此事向中中交農四行方面詢其詳情、據各該發言人所談結果、僉謂此事純係重慶總行方面負責籌辦、上海分行、迄至目前、尚無所聞、今後此事是吾擬令滬行辦理、現時殊難預料、繼據向金融界探悉、中樞統制內匯之舉、於滬戰後應即辦理、今决舉辦已屬極迫切需要、此事主辦機關以四川重慶總行最爲適宜、香港各分行工作最爲繁重、上海分行、屆時對於此事恐亦未必辦理、但滬地方面、絕非放縱不加管理、據其意料、將來定將委託市商會滬辦事處負責主持、各業公會根據各該廠商之申請、出具證明然後向沿海各城市購辦貨物、一則可執行中樞命令、一則爲防止奸人將法幣藉口外流、至於商會以前辦理各業購買外匯向四行申請事宜、照常工作、</p>

<h3>工部局警備委員會討論管理交通問題（昨績）</h3>
<p>停辦有軌電車建議</p>
<p>中國汽車偕行社續稱、有軌電車業經認為落伍、如能停駛、即可除去電車站並疏散街道上之裠衆、交通上之危險、亦當減少、惟停辦有軌電車一事、短期間內殊難實現、故逐漸用無軌電車、代替有軌電車之計劃、應儘速實行云云、查上年間、電車公司考慮改築外灘與南京路兩處之電車軌道時、即有人提議用無軌電車代替有軌電子之計度、但該公司對於此項計劃、堅決反對、其所舉理由為本埠居民擁擠、就其中在半之生活程度而言、電車實為最舍用之交通工具、且電車與拖車各一輛、可載乘客一百二十名、僅須由一人駕駛、其經濟無與倫比、當時工部局董事會考慮所得結論、為該局非俟一九四〇年依照電車營業特許合同之規定、收買電車公司以後、無權強制添辦無軌電車、收買問題、言之尚早、因此決定無庸討論、此次中國汽車偕行社所擬一節、警備委員會認為仍無商討之餘地</p>
<p>添派交通巡捕從緩</p>
<p>該社又擬請租界當道添派乘坐機器之交通巡捕、以便截獲違反交通章程之開車人、會　交出開車執照、事後向捕房納款取贖、惟出捕房向開車人微收罰金之簡易手續、尚未實施、該社願就其能力所及、協助捕房實行所擬計劃、該社以為目前交通巡捕應有一種權力、命違犯交通章程之人、停於路旁、告以所犯過失、此法對於陳舊之車輛、及故意駕駛緩慢之開車人、均可適用、警務處報告稱、目前警務人員、責任綦重、待將來環境許可、始能添派乘坐腳踏車之交通巡捕、至於責令違章之開車人交出照會一事、早經實行、捕房對於違反交通章程之人、巳有權命其停止、對於駕駛遲慢之開車、亦經隨時取締、</p>
<p>毋庸設特別交通處</p>
<p>該社又提出建議一項、謂兩租界當道、應合組一特別交通處、由著名汽車駕駛者、包括該社社員在內、參與其事、該駕駛人等當縣佩微章、並携带印就之表格、以使填報任何開車人之輕率、或危險情事、其報告書當與通常警員所提出之報告、有同等權力、而由警務處接受、此項建議、經警務處認為並無可取之處、所擬組織特別交通處一節、實非必要、蓋任何市民、得將違犯交通章程之情事報告捕房、其報告如附有詳細紀載、捕房方面必予注意、並採取必要這措置、警備委員會亦認為上項建議、在事實上頗有窒碍、且無採納之必要、</p>
<p>載重貨車停靠問題</p>
<p>該社復稱裝載重貨如木材鋼條等之汽車、往往在熱鬧時間內停放各主要馬路邊旁、例如停放漢口路起卸報館所用捲筒紙之卡車等、應由捕房注意、警務處報告稱、重貨向來不許於熱鬧時間內起卸、工務處所給執照上已載有明文、此後捕房對於其他貨物之起卸及該社所指之裝紙卡車等、自當予以注意、警備委員會各委員一致認為毋須另採他種措置、</p>
<p>紅綠燈裝置尚妥當</p>
<p>西僑李德爾會謂一九二四年至一九四六年間、交通委員會所提出之建議第二十九項、工部局巳置之不顧、該建議稱「工部應廣績試驗各種指揮交通信號、至發現最相宜之工具時為止、然後所有此種工具、應成為標準、以歸劃一、公共租界與法租界內所用指揮信號、倘屬可能、應屬一律、」目前所有交通燈之地位·顏色·烈度·高度·參差不一、且與霓虹燈欑接近、以至駕駛車輛、發生困難、關於此節、警務處聲明、指揮交通燈這標準化、進行固緩、惟與英美各國所採用之一般標準、確相接近、所須解釋者一層、即決定裝置指揮燈之地位時、並非定可嚴格遵守某種標準、每一馬路交叉點之情形、須經個別研究、其現在與將來之飾置、均應顧及、至於霓虹燈、如其裝設地位與紅綠燈相距不滿一百呎者、須申請本處審核、本處在工務處准許裝設以前、實行察看所擬裝設之地位云云、警務處繼稱、本處已與上海電力公司接洽、請其在可以實行之範圍內、達到標準化之目的、並請其估計改裝工程所需用費、當時會中有一種意見提出、即開車人注意紅燈綠燈、並無重大困難、基於上述理由、警備委員會各委員均認為無另行採取何措置之必要</p>
<p>站台短柱並無危險</p>

<h3>人生幸福和品格全繫於　生殖腺內分泌的豐足</h3>
<p>在昔醫學未昌明的時代，關於人生幸福和品格的造成，每歸之於命運中的『八子』，一個嬰兒由母胎裏出世，從他或她的落地時辰，就決定了終生苦樂和智愚。這豈不是錯誤到萬分透頂？因為今日生理學的日新月異，醫學的昌明，巳使我們深切地知道體內生殖腺內分泌的強弱，科普操縱了我人的前途和品格。因生殖腺內分泌實是我們生命的源泉。在未成年的男婦，因這種腺體的刺激和調整，有促進體高，體重以及胸圍等發育的功能。在成年以後，除有一部份貯存於精囊，為適應愛情的需要而專營生殖作用外，其餘仍由血液循環而灌漑於全身，有調整新陳代謝，滋養神經，助長發育調節情緒與理智等種種功能。所以一個青年潔身自家，保守童貞，使生殖腺液充沛者，則必體貌英俊，思想豐富，行動敏捷，品格優長，讀書習業均可超人一等，而前途更屬無量，一旦若與健美多情的女郎結婚，必然愛情繾綣，生男育女，家庭美滿，人生是何等的幸福！可是也有不要好的青年，在春情發動初期，卽犯有自　遺精，或早婚縱慾，荒淫無度，那實貴的生殖腺液經比浪費，怎能不枯竭？一是凡滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全。精薄不育，神經衰弱等症，卽不一而足。此種青年，不是雖已成人，而全身一如童稚，或年齡未增而巳現衰老，讀書習業，均將半途而廢。在夫婦生活上亦必為妻不滿，試想妻子的熱情，而無人予以消受，怎能不使她惱恨填譍，而家庭也就多故呢？是以消極懶散，品格與聲譽浪籍，前途幸福亦復喪盡！唯一补救办法，據世界名醫及余經驗，均以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最為對症特效。因此劑係專治上述各症，而品質之高與效力之大，尤為其他類似製劑所不及。所以於服後卽能生精補腎，滋養神經，助長發育，調整新陳代謝，能繼績服用半月，必可將上述各症根本治愈。四季常服更可收益壽遠童之效。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制止遺洩，則標本兼治。收效更速！</p>
<h3>遺精惡化後的可怕</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>遺精症雖然可怕，但尚是前期症，若由遺精而釀成了滑精漏精症，那才真正的危險之至！遺精症的來源，據醫學上的論斷，大都因自瀆縱欲民，氫性神經斷傷了，於是精關的管束即不能嚴密。在夜間酣眠神經呈休息態時，偶有美夢繚繞，性神經稍受刺激，精液即遺洩而出，雖或由夢中驚醒，但已無及！此時若服特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」以增強精關之機能，則遺精即可痊愈，所最可惜者，多數人每以為遺精並不是病，旣不痛，又不癢關什麼緊呢？要知不痛不癢的毛病，是最厲害的毛病、遺精若遲延失治，因為精液繼績的遺失，性神經必日益衰弱，精關必日益鬆弛。因此在夜間即無夢境的刺激，精液每順流而出。一覺醒來，褲已污濕，這是多麼的惱恨呢！遺精進至此階段，即成滑精症。若再因循失治，那雖在白日因用腦力過度，或偶見女色，或在大小便時，均可使此物勃起，而有精液洩出，這就是最可怕的漏精症。我們的血肉之軀，體內的精液是有限的。今遺洩滑漏不止，怎能不枯竭？則凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精薄不育等症更相繼併發。是以志氣消沉，精神萎靡，怕寒畏熱，萬事消極，在學校的學生，因不能專心一志，大有留級退學的危險！在商店工廠習業的青年，因不能集精會神，亦有不能勝任之虞！在男女之間，因體貌不揚，未婚者有陷於失戀的悲慘，已婚者於夫婦生活上亦必不能美滿，為妻憎恨，家庭每演出種種悲劇！</p>
<p>所以遺精症必須及早作澈底治療.治法.據世界名醫及余經驗均以服「希米脫氏固精片」，則即可聓固精關，鎮靜神經，使夜得安眠，夢幻減少，遺精旣可於當夜立止。復振足了精神。如因遺精失治已有滑精漏精，或早婚縱欲使生殖腺液枯竭而有上述諸症者，則須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，若繼績服用半月以後，更可助長發育，調整新陳代謝，上述各症即可根本治愈。中老年人常服更可收延年益壽返老還童之效。</p>
<p>遺精患者楊長青君，江寧人，年二十六歲，兼有腦弱腎虧，余即囑服上述良藥，並施以電療注射，經一月的悉心治療，果回復了他美滿健康，日昨來函，盛謝再造之恩！</p>

<h3>乳峯對女性幸福所關至大</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>昨在邵君的一個宴會席上，聽到某百貨公司經理張君的一席談話，覺得很有意義，特為記之如左，他說：『獨脫姚：我自從在申報上看到人們健康知識所論的乳峯發育以後，除對你們做醫生的苦心孤詣，造福人羣，表示無限欽敬之外，而同時覺得女子乳峯，萎滬與高聳，其間的確大有關係，我對於醫道雖是門外漢，不懂什麼生殖腺，卵巢機能等等名詞。但在女性的姿態上看來，好像看到乳峯高聳的女性，不管她的面貌怎麼樣，總覺有一種說不出來的好感。反之，如乳峯萎滬，臀部瘦削的女子，那麼她的衣飾無論怎樣生得美麗，不知怎的，見了就會發生一種憎惡……』語至此，有一位會計師×君，就向著張君笑問道，『你這樣愛好健美，然則尊夫人的胸前雙峯，是否能夠合乎你的理想？』張君卽正色道：『說句忠實話，幸得戝內的乳峯發育尚佳，否則雖不至於壞了良心道德遺棄她，但難免不要在外面偷偷摸摸了！』</p>
<p>觀乎上述，足見乳峯對女性的幸福，所關至大。如不幸萎滬，應速求科學的彌補，據世界婦科名醫康德林及余經驗。均一致以服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』最為對症而特效，蓋此劑係由壯健動物之卵巢分泌及礦植物之補腦血成分，經科學方法配製而成。故功效偉大，藥性和平，不分寒暑，均可常服，若連服二月，不特可以萎滬的乳峯隆然高聳，同時且能調整月經，消滅子宮障碍，促進妊娠機能，紅潤面頰，長駐青春。</p>

<h3>尿中忽然出血的淋病</h3>
<p>在吾輩醫家日常時所遭遇之淋病症象中，有不少的病人，忽因尿中出血而莫名其驚恐。實則正亦不必作此大驚小怪，淋病而尿中出血，是淋毒性膀胱炎一症，恒所遇之也。而膀胱炎一症之成因，十之七八，由於行局部器械手術之結果，因爲不純練之手術，在行術時，淋菌往往自後尿道達於膀胱，因而侵蝕膀胱粘膜，遂發膀胱炎。此時之小便，全部溷濁，甚至有血尿流出，最重者爲膀胱內出血淸。又因血管破裂口大時，則其所出之血淸，瀦留膀胱，而使尿液全作赤色。幸此種現象亦不恒見。而以一般而倫，不過多在排尿時，因膀胱壁肌肉收縮的關係，而有少量之出血。至於膀胱中的出血情形，則多在尿後，以其淋菌多先侵犯膀胱頸部故也。此症之特徵爲下腹部，恥骨縫際感到刺痛，此刺痛在排尿時放散於陰莖之先端也。</p>
<p>治療此症，宜注意本症狀程度如何。宜於膀胱洗滌法者，有宜於温罨法者，有宜於服用利尿劑者，而最新化學療法，對此症尤有特殊之功效。但是對於治療此症時所用之手術，仍須敏捷熟練，否則若更破壞創口，猶火上添油，變本加厲，故尿中見血之淋病患者，切勿胡亂擇醫，和濫服市上成藥，宜求有經騐而肯負責之醫師治之。</p>

<h3>打抽豐</h3>
<p>本埠昇平戲館之帳官案目，每逢季節或年終，必有抽抽豐之舉。今年端午節曾備紅柬多副，內書案目姓名，於城廂內外之各當道富户大商，及花柳中妓女等處分送，名爲延請看戲，實則打抽豐之意也。無論往觀與否，皆須送銀洋一二元，是故各户意有不願。廵捕頭聞得此舉，即着廵捕將送柬之人，並紅柬多副，一併拿入捕房，捕房即將昇平帳房之寧人李姓查訊。李稱此每年如此，且皆係案目所爲，即會審委員處，亦皆有之，然並不關帳房之事。是以捕頭聞得此言，殊難深信，即於日昨轉解至公堂會訊。李姓所供，大略如前，惟不説委員處亦有請帖之語而已。李又稱：「我在小東門現開兩店，並未有壞名聲，此事實係案目所爲，且並無李姓在帖上等語。」張公曰：「爾之作爲，我已深知，何尚冠冕若此。今連我都攀在裏頭，實爲可笑！」着將李暫押，候提齊案目等四人，訊後發落。次日覆審，據案目聲稱：「戲園中發帖，於我等四人全不知情。」張公又質於李姓，李姓仍圖抵賴。於是張公將其從前劣跡，一一數説，着具保完案。</p>

<h3>金融　國際空氣尙佳　金價易於下瀉</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、因國際情况日與我國有利、且歐洲局勢逐漸緊張、外滙因之現期均硬、人心亦隨之轉疲、多方交易已抱薄利主義者居多、致易於下瀉、與上二日之情形、適成反比例、初開雖某錢兌業祇塞出百餘兩、但買方僅有一二十兩吃胃、致缺乏維持、一度曾退達三千五百六十五元低盤、嗣因外滙稍見回軟、引起買風、某銀樓復來加碼、兼之證劵帮與某令號亦跟踪吸收、加以某錢兌業亦止塞力進、是以市象一度轉堅、曾昂達三千六百六十元高峰、入後聞證券帮趁高獲利了結、及銀樓帮頻來塞出、市勢重疲、結果以三千六百元收盤、較隔昨疲落四十元、交易尚旺、的八百兩光景、銀樓飾金終則掛小五元、海關金與中英純金等仍呆定如故、</p>
<h3>烚赤軋跌四十元</h3>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因外滙報硬、人心帶疲、開市即做低十元、某錢兌業賣予某金號十兩、價三千六百三十元、開後外滙仍逐步鬆硬、且某錢兌業繼續力塞百餘兩、加以買方納胃不健、祗有一二十兩吃胃、故於交易淸稀中傾跌六十五兀、某錢兌業又賣予某金號十兩、價三千五百六十五元、時某錢兌業已止塞觀望、且銀樓帮乘低吸收、致市勢向上、不久即回至三千六百元關外、銀樓帮進錢兌業十兩、價三千六百十五元、其時聞外滙突止鬆趨緊、買風更盛、證券帮與某銀樓競來吸納、加以某錢兌業亦來復進、市勢愈堅、又飛漲四十五元、某銀樓進金號五十兩、價三千六百六十元、十一時半後、證券帮忽趁高出籠、且某銀號亦來塞出、市象轉疲、立刻在瀉四十元、某錢兌業售予某金號二十兩、價三千六百二十元、繼而某金號叉進某銀樓四十兩、價三千六百二十六元、後證劵帮賣予錢兌業二十兩、三千六百二十元爲午收價、聞收後三千六百十元有售者而無進戶之說、午後市勢仍疲、開市較午收即做低二十元、金號賣予錢兌業十兩、價爲三千六百元、時證券帮稍來吸收、一度回高、證券帮進某銀號五十兩、價三千六百十二元、後因銀樓帮頻來塞出、重向下游、銀樓帮賣予錢兌業三十兩、爲三千六百元、作晚收價、結果比隔昨軋跌四十元、全天九十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢鮮聞成交、</p>
<h3>首飾金掛小五元</h3>

<h3>貼現若狂</h3>
<p>低至一百四十五元</p>
<p>最後高至二百十元</p>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、先跌後突回昻、每千元初爲一百七十元左右、繼即步跌、最低做過一百四十五元、近午回升至一百六十元以上、下午需求現鈔者多、昂勢突銳、竟跳起五十元、飛出二百元關、最後高達二百十元、比前日回高五十元、錢業公會之拆息、早午仍懸二角云</p>
<h3>大條近平遠縮</h3>
<p>八月一日倫敦電、銀市有人補空、少交易、市面平、收盤後仍平、大條銀、近期勿動、遠期回縮〇六二五、紐約銀電、美現貨呆定如故、又孟買銀電、印銀市况沉寂、現期貨俱未更動、而成交亦毫無做開、</p>
<h3>多方轉賣愈殷　外匯期現一致鬆動</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、滙豐掛牌、悉無變動、英美滙暗市、因鑒當日報載、英美法對援助中國法幣、正在積極商討、且傳英日小組會議、英國拒絕中國所存津地之白銀談判、故多方出籠之心愈切、日行與投機商競相脫售、加以外行吃胃呆滯、致市勢步硬、一度英金曾鬆至四便士牛、美匯亦曾硬至八元七一八七五、嗣以英行滙豐對於英金四便士半、吃胃頗健、且洋行亦趁賤扒吸、致爲狀轉軟、結果英長〇三一二五、美硬〇六二五、而本月期因外行納胃更淡、故情况尤較現貨為鬆、計英金會硬至四便士二五、美匯亦鬆八元二五、後因新豐洋行與日行等相繼猛吸、致亦稍回軟、終則英尚軋硬一八七五、美亦賤三四三七五、是以掉期愈見軋攏、照午收英金相差二一八七五、美匯距離四六八七五、的合月息（除佣）五分三厘、而套利者實際上祗可貼進美金三一二五、的合月息僅三分七八厘、半天交易尚旺、至港匯聞銀行賣價爲三十元〇三七五、</p>
<h3>新豐扒結市勢回</h3>
<p>晨初以倫教大條、近期平定、逮期回縮〇六二五、紐約銀價呆定、倫敦生金仍平、匯兌英對美·對滬·對法均無變化、美對英·對滬·對法亦均未更動、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金四便士三七五、美匯八元五六二五、較之前收、英平美硬〇三一二五、開後因日銀行與華商投機家均競相吐售、加以洋行結款稀少、致市勢帶硬、日行與投機商相繼塞予外行華比·有利現貨英金四便士四三七五及四六八七五、並現貨美滙八元六二五及六八七五、迨匯豐掛牌揭喨勿動、及白銀平衡稅褐曉依然免微、此後某美行塞予匯豐現貨英金竟硬至四便士半、同時現貨美匯亦鬆至八元七一八七五、時外行互做本月份美滙竟亦硬達八元二五、同時本月份英金亦鬆至四便士二五、十一時後新豐洋行突來購結美行本月份美匯八元〇六二五及一二五、繼之日商銀行亦吸進外行本月份央金四便士一八七五及一五六二五、是以爲狀稍回、將近午刻、某洋行結進華比現貨英金四便士四〇六二五、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英余四便士四〇六二五、美滙八元五九三七五、本月份英金四便士一八七五、美匯八元一二五、比上日現貨、英鬆〇三一二五、美硬〇六二五、本月份英賤一八七五、美鬆三四三七五、午後週三無市、</p>

<h3>外幣行市疲弱</h3>
<p>昨日外幣英美金鎊、因外匯市况趨鬆、給赤軟弱下降關係、供給頗殷、俱趨下跌、英美金票需要較稀、市况虛弱、香港票澳金票供給稍盛、紛告下降、僅義大利票有需要獨趨堅昂、日金票供求頗盛、市况微佾、晚市爲一元零五分七厘、朝鮮票需要呆滯、復形疲弱、晚市爲八角七分五厘、公會交易甚稀、祥泰出福和祥進法郞票二千個、昨日市價、英美金鎊俱降二元、英金票降一元一角、美金票降二角香港票降四分、澳金票降五角、義大利票升四分、其他各幣俱未更動、</p>
<h3>證券　內債上漲　外股冷落</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况忽因一部份補空而劇漲甚猛、甲種因行將抽籤關係、驟高一元九角、但以銀行不允做押款、多方未敢放手做去、檯面交易最爲熱鬧、英美對華感情仍舊不改、因天津事件而受意外影響、人心因之安定、多方因除息價與連息價已相等、故亦頗有售出、趨勢或將穩定一時、昨日初開、人心仍覺恍惚、與隔日價幾仍相同、繼以十一號進胃甚濃、市價乃逐步提高、同康同順聯和聯益先後收買、一味補空做多、甲種抬至五元外、賣方陣綫稍弱、紙松茂元康永康等供出頗多、餘則散戶亦有賣出、　面做手、烘雲托月、更有美法英聯合維持法幣之傳言、未免　之過易、市價結果、再漲一元二角半至一元九角、成交總數共計的一百二十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>類別　最高　最低　收盤比前日</p>

<p>統戊四二·四〇四一·五〇　四二·四〇又一·二五</p>
<p>股票交易、成交祇華商證券交易所少數、價為二十八元</p>
<p>衆業公所報告昨市氣淸淡交易甚稀、銀根似見放鬆、匯劃貼現已低落、外匯近遠期相戴亦改微、此對於股市可抱樂觀、若能續形如此、入後股價當有起色、但目今市面仍見輕忽、</p>
<p>倫敦遠東各公司股票本月一日（週一）掛牌行市、大體均告下跌、匯豐銀行股跌半鎊、英倫註冊股爲七十四鎊半、香港註冊股爲七十六鎊半、朝鮮煤礦股跌三便士、爲四先令六便士、古拉客林傍橡皮股回降六便士、仍爲十七先令六便士、餘無變動、</p>

<h3>紗花　日紗高過本紗　囤戶意興更熱烈　特金城再創新價</h3>
<p>紗市始漲繼回、結果平平、但有一部份南方需要之紗及缺現之貨、一律仍見上升、漲勢本屬和緩、無奈一般人受謠諑朋興之刺激、重整旗鼓、復來在拖、故外匯已穩、現金亦不瘋狂、棉紗市塲獨見上騰、有一部份意見、以廠方不開貨、還是囤塌棉紗爲好、加之日紗價較華紗爲高、於是買者興致勃勃、近來紗布之漲風頗熾、此爲最大因素也、二十支特金城因香港帮搜買殷切、漲力意外堅强、本日已到六百九十元、此價可稱已逹登峰造極之境、</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、不知廣帮萬興號在市放價吸收雙馬現貨、一時形勢頓見緊張、買去幾十包、價爲五百九十六元、比上日再漲八元、棧單價始開五百七十七元、到八十元、少頃以價高復多頭出籠、賣戶又見擁擠、不到一刻、忽然回挫、棧單價爲五百七十二元半、外棧雙馬亦跌至五百八十八元、與上日價相仿、收盤亦平平、查半日成交統計、千九百七十包、仍以同行中成交占多數、行情雙馬平平、特金城再漲十五元、冷門貨亦提升五元、廠方由永安廠開出二十支時金城八十包價爲六百九十元、十支特金城二百包、價爲六百四十元、今日有棉紗十九件運烟台、一百五十五件運天津、二十件運厦門、三十件運香港、六十件運廣州灣、三十件運北海、茲將各帮口買去之額量分別如左、</p>
<p>香港　八三〇　同行　九五五</p>
<p>（天津）一五〇　內地　三五</p>
<p>統計一、九七〇</p>
<p>日紗市面近來大漲之原因有二、（一）據市塲言、北方土產出口旺盛、客商為避免損失計、將貨款套掉日紗布疋運返家鄉、（二）又有一說、下月起改用某項鈔票、一般商人囤貨之念、愈形熱烈、因此日紗棉布北方交易、大見進展矣、</p>
<h3>日廠原料不足　印棉續有成交</h3>
<p>本棉交易依然陷入停頓之途、惟印棉生意蟬聯不絕、同業成交因連朝爲額已巨、然此項交易轉輾大都解給日廠應用、本日日商洋行及日廠購進六百件、足見該廠之存棉未能充足、隨時補充、至於華廠絲</p>
<p>惠司登　一一七·〇〇　豐田廠進　四〇〇件　鈔票送廠</p>
<p>彭家浦　一二〇·〇〇　日信行進　二〇〇件　又　棧交</p>
<p>又　一三〇·〇〇　業中進　二〇〇件　又　又</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、因日來貼現率降低、銀根亦轉趨鬆動、交易漸見向榮、唯所交易者、祇限於同業之手貨、因彼等之售價、較之洋行方面每擔可廉二十元左右也、致於吃戶以日廠較多、該因日廠存底微薄故也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日最初先因同業間之多頭了結、及賣出而跌三至八磅音、後接棉區氣象報告惡劣、及新毫無採辦之舉、據業中人云、華商紗廠幾家巨廠儲藏原料充盈、足够供給六七個月之食糧、至少可紡三四個月、在工作方面着想、決無問題也、不過新創紗廠之原料囤積比較薄弱也、蘇北來源不旺、計到通花一百二十包、又棉花今日有四十件、運往香港、又機棉花二百九十件、運往寗波、茲將現棉情形列左、買戶之踴躍、市價遂漲、繼因政府報告倉庫存底减少、及南方現貨交易增加、及利物浦來電良好而再漲、結果收盤較之日前漲八磅音、印度昨日停市、預測不動、埃及張十餘鎊　、</p>
<h3>雜糧　豆子芝繭運華南</h3>
<p>今（三日）有豆子廿包、運往厦門、又八百三十包、運往香港、另有芝蔴二十包、亦運厦門、</p>
<h3>糧食　米成奇貨　米商又不出樣</h3>
<p>杜粳　昨日河下貨抵埠計松江及南港早晚稻十二儎、車輪包子二千餘包、市上又有謠言、謂河下貨自此批到後、難以繼續之說、在米商但望來源有時中斷、可以居奇、至蕪湖開禁、因某方阻梗尚未實施、東新自一批抵滬後、其第二批貨、聞亦爲途中多所阻難、尚未到達、滬埠棧積、聞尚有二十餘萬包、其中粳米尚餘四萬餘包、糯米五千餘包、餘則悉屬尖米、大局市况、自隔昨轉漲後、客販囤戶又在居奇、若厚薄粳高貨悉不出樣、而一般宿貨亦屬寥寥、本街銷塲則殊活潑、全市做開無錫宿黃粳二十元、周莊粳二十元、及决蕪尖十六元、砶尖十五元八角、變元二十二元、香港糯二十二元半、成交數二千七百餘石、業外交易、則不在此數、而暗盤喊價又起、但以市塲工部局駐員監視殊嚴、舉動鬼祟、無從據實、惟聞在市外交易之行情、竟有粳米達二十三元、及高尖十八元之說、查米價之漲、米商與某方互相利用、一則操縱居奇、一則多所勒索、欲使滬上人生活高貴、不能久居，亦可窺其內心之毒辣矣、</p>
<p>客秈　產地開禁之舉、迄未正式證實、而貨方恐開禁絕望、莫不繼續擯持、惟店存甚枯、納胃本貪、且在粳米暗盤過貴之際、乃多垂靑於低價之客秈、然高秈如南京秈已喊至十九元、高蕪秈十八元半、與限盤相差甚遠、故十六元之價祇有熱宿决米點綴、即砶米亦已到達十六元、比之前市又漲半元至六七角不等、</p>
<p>洋米　昨因各米飛騰、新西貢乃爲店舖零戶注神、統市開出五百包、價至廿五元七角、亦比週初價蛟大七角之譜、</p>
<h3>小麥放價收買　麵粉仍居定局</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨現粉交易、尤見活潑、緣各項銷路均有、廠方則以原料成本高貴、及米價暗漲甚烈、粉價雖到五元、比較尚屬低廉、故對於大票客囤需要、仍加限制、市上回籠貨價亦提高、昨本客在市均有吸收、併計成交續有四萬包弱、二號粉廠盤一律五元現鈔、回籠貨售價則仍有參差、又麵粉今日有五百包、運往威海衛、</p>
<p>小麥　昨新麥到源絡繹、滬寗津浦兩路均有運到、存棧貨亦屬不少、自廠家正式購辦後、行囤吸收、辦興允濃、福新廠又添辦一千五百包、惟吃盤重視、囤戶方面亦辦高中各麥共二千餘包、市因供求兩活、價又寬放數分、計開崑山麥六元九角至八角、丹陽大橋六元八角、戚墅堰六元六角、南京采石磯等麥六元六角至三角六分云</p>
<h3>疋頭　粗布細料　售盤俱漲一元　各布銷路大盛</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨布市漲風愈演愈烈、怡和十六磅雙象粗布經山東帮繼續搜羅、手貨居奇、每疋在抬至十七元七角半、較前突增一元、怡和三兎三桃等牌細斜亦驟漲一元、乃緣東疋市盤飛漲、本街批發號染廠均有進胃、餘外各牌白貨染色布亦一致提漲、頗多參差、下午現鈔貼現率猛升、貨價始稍回挫、現銷本街最旺、成交細布細斜粗布綫呢嗶嘰絨布羽綢等貨四百餘件、甬帮辦色布色斜一百數十箱、粵港帮辦細斜綫呢色斜七八十箱、山東帮辦十六磅粗布四五十包、國外暹羅採辦色布色斜綫呢印花絨二千數百疋、蘇浙內地批發均有起色、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>晨市因津帮續辦細布細斜、售盤再見高峰、十二磅龍頭細布現貨做開每疋十六元九角、下月期貨飛漲至十七元一角、嗣以漲勢過暴、現鈔貼水復昂、本街進胃轉後、漸形回軟、結果龍頭細布爲十六元六角牛、然較前日行情每疋尚提升四角、全日成交北帮採辦五百餘件、本街實銷祗一二百件、四君子嗶嘰直貢市上喊盤已在升至每碼四角九分、</p>
<p>出口</p>
<p>今（三日）有疋頭三十件、運往烟台、又七十件運天津、四十件運厦門、七件運香港、二十　運廣州灣、</p>
<h3>呢絨市塲關金謠</h3>
<p>呢絨售價、自外匯接述傾瀉後、無一不漲、但照現在滙票揭合、均不能到本、不料日來由洋方面透出新奇消息、謂關金即須變動、（一）有將今之二元三角九的海關金、不日要加倍至四元七角八分、（二）或云不日付關稅、齊須改用「華興」鈔票、甚至以法幣掉購「華興」偽票、每元還要貼水二三角、第一說苟成爲事實、呢絨成本、又要高漲一分細、第二說、想各友邦維持法幣、決不有所破壞也、</p>
<h3>絲茶　華絲銷美有望</h3>
<p>本埠絲市、因匯値好轉、出品市價、乃相對减低、白廠本反洋行吃價爲二五〇〇元左右、但無有售者、七八分白廠仍售三一二〇元、計做開三十担、印莊白土絲漲二十元做開十五担、整個絲市、頗感猶豫、因目下絲價乃賴外匯支持、故絲價能維持若干時期之高價、無人能知、但另一面、內地繭運之路依然閉塞如前、國外美日商的取消後、華絲銷美、勢必可能增加、則此二點、絲價似尚可樂觀也、故一般謹愼廠商、咸祗售現貨、對期貨來賬、均裹足不前、故邇來絲價雖昂、交易並未隨之熱鬧也、</p>
<p>生絲今（三日）有十八件、運往香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗白本冰　同跌一元</h3>
<p>昨糖市據倫敦電、無甚上落、八月份七先令〇七五、十二月份六先令二辦士七五、明年三月份六先令三辦士二五、本市公會趨勢續軟、現貨二四粗白本棧跌九角、爲三十二元半、外棧降一元、爲三十二元二角、轉口貨降度相同、爲二十四元、太古車白小二三角、西棧B嘜三十八元二角、OW嘜三十七元八角、OX嘜三十七元六角、DY嘜三十七元二角、HX嘜三十七元、荷赤小四角、現貨二十八元六角、轉口貨小二角、爲二十二元、本綿白跌半元、振紀一號三十三元、二號一二十二元半、三號三士一元、四號三十一元半、本一號冰降一元、爲三十八元半、晶明冰四十元、國糖亦呈軟勢、致乏成交云、</p>

<h3>不動心</h3>
<p>— 瑜</p>
<p>聽見惡消息，我們自然要皺一下眉頭，咬一下牙齒；同樣，聽見好消息，我們也不免點一下頭，作會心的微笑。人類是感情的動物，在感情上受到可恨或可喜的波動，有這種表示，乃是理所當然的。</p>
<p>然而我以爲我們在平時作這種感情的表示，是隨便的，在這非常的大時代，堅决抗戰以求建國的大時代，這就不應該，並且不够了。</p>
<p>我們在一起首，便已知道我們責任的艱鉅，並且我們也早已立定意志，要不問環境如何變更，百折不撓，來達到我們的目的。那末，任何外來的消息，不諭惡的或好的，我們除了密切注意，取作參考以外，我們實在沒有動感情的理由。並且恨的感情表示，往往會使人懊喪，而喜的感情表示，則又往往會使人懈怠。山懊喪而志氣消沉，由懈怠而精神渙散，乃是必然的結果，我們絕對不需要！</p>
<p>不動感情，就是我們先哲所說的不動心。這原是古往今來一切大人物所必須修養到的工夫。我們現現在的人，當然不見得個個是大人物，但我們是黃帝的子孫，天之驕子，我們决不敢妄自非薄。我們是大國的國民，要在這生死存亡的關頭，大家不動心。</p>
<p>我們决不是冷酷無情。實在的，我們的感情，完全寄託在我們的國家民族身上，已經超出了平當的感情範圍了。假使說我們還不免於因恨而雛眉，因笑而展顏的，我們一定在這笑與皺收之外，要加倍的努力，來達到我們感情的完全發作。</p>
<p>在這感情的完全發作還沒有達到以前，我們就只有不動心，雖然有時與我們不利，似乎不帮我們，大都也只是爲了他們自己利益，並非有所怨於我們；同樣，除了我們自己以外，他們雖然有時與我們有利，似乎帮我們，也往往爲了他們自己的利益，並非。定有所愛於我們。那末，我們那裏還應該因我們而忽恨忽喜呢！</p>
<p>「泰山崩於前，而色不變；麋鹿興於左，而目不瞬，」我們要這樣的不動心，只望着目的向前直跑才是！否則，此後惡消息或好消息，將續續而來，我們只有感情衝動，還能作什麼呢？</p>
<h3>鄕訊</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>一封小小的信函，十二行老式的紅格信箋。我幾乎不相信這上面寫着一個靑年扼腕的事，一個可歎的遭遇。他不是腐朽的人，那也不是應該的事。他是靑年，前途充滿了光和花和力。他有才幹，有志氣，也有春天。</p>
<p>然而他就這麼葬送了……我把眼睛落到了潦草的字跡上。</p>
<p>「……告訴你，我們這兒的空氣給一陣烟霧瀰漫了。每人都像跌落在雲端裹，走路時四肢無力，整日像過着春天　懶洋洋文縐縐的，簡直手無縛鷄之力。好在一切都很方便　沒有什麽顧忌的。因此人人都愛有這一份享受了。讓白飯養活他們的肚子，黑麵包養活他們的精神。沒有了這玩兒，彷彿他們整個身體就萎　了。……」</p>
<p>然而，難道有了他們的享受，就不萎癟嗎？我記得有多少黃蠟的面孔。他們也依舊是萎癟的。</p>
<p>信上接着說：</p>
<p>「雲現在的樣子，你再看見他時，怕不會認得他了。他的母親爲他痛哭。婆心的苦勸，只落得兒干撒野的毆打。她也不能再在家住下去了。兒子不能扶養她。他把整個志趣，生命，幸福和忠心全獻給他的嗜好。</p>
<p>我眞不免有點感傷。家鄉的泥土上，有一决印下我流亡的脚跡。那時候還是初夏，充滿了動盪與騒亂。一切惡劣的命運都還不會擺佈妥貼。雖然有許多痛心的印象我都看見過了，我冷笑過那些牛鬼蛇神，我想用脆弱的手扭去威脅的鐵鎖。欺詐使人啞然，冷酷使人塞戰。我經騐得很多。可是黑色的恐怖，郤還沒有這麽濃。低壓的空氣透不出一絲呼吸的淸明，但這時沒有霧，黑色的霧，腐敗窒人的氣息。</p>
<p>一月後，我的住處來了一位花白頭髮步履蹣跚的老婆婆。她是雲的母親。到上海來是投女兒女婿家過活的，她告訴我了。我們談了一番家鄉的近况。</p>
<p>「現在的家鄉，不比從前了。上癮的人多得數不淸。滿處掛着『售吸」招牌，看到這招牌，人便進去躺下來受用。入晚時，才像樣兒呢。街巷上，一盞盞燈張了起來，這全是他們的市招……」</p>
<p>「一盞盞燈。」一幅極其動人的印象懸在我的眼前。我惋惜，也惆悵。</p>
<p>「全城怕有百幾十家，生賣的店還在外。怕至少也有三四十家。」我聽了，禁不住站起來，歇斯的里地高呼了。「百幾十家，三四十家，埋葬了多少人的命運呢。多少人站在岸邊的沈淪到海裏，原來沈淪的也跌得更深更深了：」</p>
<p>鼻端浮漾着邪惡的氣息。我彷彿已看見五百里外的故鄉了。</p>
<p>老婆子把那被咬傷的膀臂給我看，說那是給兒子的牙齒嚙破了的。因爲退勒她用首飾給他去當賣，不答應便用武了</p>
<p>「先生，你也知道我兒子不是那麽一　下流坯，但是命運弄到這步田地，有什麽辦法呢……我這老苦命，這一生是靠不着兒子了……靠不着兒子了……只有來生吧……只有……」</p>
<p>我呆呆地，望着她哭着走了出去。</p>
<p>在這天夜晚，我有一個夢。我用憤怒的手臂撲殺那些自甘墮落的人。事實使我失望了。墮落的僅僅雲一個人嗎，不。有無數的靑年在自己撕去自己的血肉，在墮落。我撲殺不盡。而且也還有一條大狼給他們撑腰，當我撲殺時，狼便挺身而出了。牠向我張牙，舞爪，凶戾地長號。像雲那樣的靑年多着呢。黑暗的空氣籠罩了他，一僩空空的人便失去了中心的舵。然而這僅僅是沈淪的人的罪孽嗎？這以外還有更大的罪魁。這漫騰騰的雲霧，窒人的氣息，導人作惡的豺狼。</p>
<p>「我們這兒的空氣給一陣烟霧瀰漫了。」</p>
<p>烟霧中埋葬了多少靑年的命運。又何止小學敎員的靈？對着這一紙心驚肉跳的鄉音，我該是憂愁，是憤怒。</p>
<p>『老張，瞧我的！你怎麽辦？』</p>

<h3>卓別麟新片　「獨裁者」秋季公映</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>最近好萊塢傳出消息：說是聯美的重要人物雪爾佛史東向人表示，著名的製片人兼大明星卓別麟的新片「獨裁者」，將在本年秋季提早公映。卓別麟預定費一個月的時間，把「獨裁者」攝成影片，現在故事早經編好了。</p>
<p>卓別麟本人，還是照預定計劃，前後飾兩個角色。就卓氏所向人表示者，這部影片，佈局方面，故事的描寫當然涉及獨裁者，但最重要的目標，還是在引觀衆的歡笑。根據目前的政治情形，來應用到笑劇的典型上面去。</p>
<p>他以爲一般的人們，過分的莊嚴而有最高權力者，結果還是成了被人在笑的標的。在「獨裁者」一片中，車別麟自己，除了編故事，擔任監製，導演而外，更做演員。所以一身要兼數職，而就他自己的表白，這部影片不但他第一决在銀幕上開口，就是成續，也要超過他以前所導演的一切影片。</p>
<p>雪爾佛史東更向人表示，以卓別麟這樣過去有驚人成續的人才來攝製這部影片，無疑，「獨裁者」將爲一九三九年度聯美的唯一鉅片。一待拍攝完竣而後，將在世界各地所有歡迎幽默作品的影片的城市同時公映。</p>
<h3>談祥梅寺</h3>
<p>— 肖傖</p>
<p>祥梅寺一劇，係寫黃巢謀反及寺僧了空避難卒致身亡事。劇中人雖爲丑與凈角對工佳劇，而實際上丑重於凈不知若干倍，緣凈角在此劇中，僅重念白架子與神氣而已。但黃巢一角，必須做到氣勢雄岸，工架整飭，有叱咜風雲不可一世之概，方爲上乘。錢金福之所以聲聞卓著蓋在此耳。了空一角，通體韻白，須念得字字得力，不作浮響，身段更屬繁重吃力，周旋步武，十分美觀，而最難厥在逃避無策時出塲之前俯後仰，一步一趨，王長林能在此塲表演身輕若燕，在晚年時亦未稍遜，眞絕作也。在前塲之添燈油及敬香之身段手法與眼神，長林亦色色俱工，此劇王氏在舊都頗目珍秘，戲院中不常露演，必待堂會中主人點演，始與錢金福合演。長林幾决南下，曾屢屢演唱，實則渠在海上第一次演祥梅寺，乃在民十以前（的在民七八年間），武進陶希泉先生滬寓堂會中，由主人到平約其來滬，極受座客激賞。愚尚憶及該决堂會中尚有余叔岩與楊寳忠演出也。了空打扮係戴僧帽，著綠僧衣，鈎丑瞼，無甚特異之點，惟黃巢一角，錢金福之打扮，於前塲着藍褶子，佩寳劍，後塲戴草王盔帶翎子，後懸尾子（即狐尾）着黃蟒黃靠，臉譜爲額間繪金錢形之油紅三塊瓦臉，雙眉與湘江會之吳起相類似；今之凈角無不宗法金福，實則早年黃巢之服飾，係戴紅大葉巾，紅絨球面排也。</p>
<p>王長林錢金福兩伶合演此劇，自是名貴絕唱。長林之前，名丑頗多，若劇趕三，羅百壽，趙仙舫諸名伶，然皆不以祥梅寺著稱，其擅演此劇而又卓絕歌壇者，惟楊鳴玉耳。鳴玉即楊三，蘇丑之第一名家，善崑曲，唱念做作，無不神妙，楊三之後，繼起乏人，故當時有楊三死後無崑丑之一語。伊演祥梅寺，必在新年元宵節晚上出演，亦梨園掌故也。王長林隨余叔岩蒞丹桂第一台時，唱祥梅寺與之配黃巢者，不知是吾馮志奎，又隨言菊朋王瑤卿王幼卿蒞老共舞台時，配長林唱此劇之黃巢爲蔣少奎，此爲愚親聆者；又長林與郝壽臣在滬亦曾演過，愚前數年在大世界京班中見一丑角曾演此，今則黃金之劉斌崑，亦以此劇爲入所稱也。</p>
<p>早年之祥梅寺，本列於前三齣戲碼中，自王長林錢金福騰踔藝壇以此劇冠絕一時後，遂被聆曲者驚爲絕唱，戲以人傳，王錢之技，又豈後人所能企及者哉。</p>

<p>— （杜鰲）</p>
<h3>樂園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>今昔邀角之不同</p>
<p>證以上述種種事實，可見徐城歷來即爲名伶過往蒼萃之地，所以我和蘇少卿君自幼即習知梨園中許多故實，就中允以邀角一事，頗饒興趣，茲特略述如後。</p>
<p>從前無論怎樣著名的角兒，全都沒有自備私房行頭的一說，除稍有聲名的老生·武生·靑衣·花旦·間或自備髯口·靴鞋·水紗·網巾·刀·槍·包頭·珠花·寸子（即踩矯所用之木板·綉鞋·）等零星物件外，其餘一切服裝，無不臨時向後台管理大衣箱二衣箱者取用之。故而伶人之易地搭班者，行動異常便利，絕無今日名角離平時，運輒携帶箱數十件之種種麻煩也。正因共來去甚形便利之故，所以往往就會發生好角私奔的種種奇聞，醫如徐州鄰近的幾處大碼頭的戲館老闆，他們打聽得當地那一個園子生意最好，全憑什麽角色號召觀衆，於是河南境內如開封·鄭州·安徽境內如宿州·蚌埠·等地的園主就私下派人携帶巨款來秘密進行他們勾角（從前全說勾角）的工作了。被派出的這人不但有胆有識，辦事機警，而且還得是一位不怕棍打不懼刀扎的硬漢，如此方能不辱君命奏凱而還。</p>
<p>襄時交通不便，人烟稀少，雖是著名城鎭，亦不過設有客棧四五處，况且棧房的老關照例都是和輪子行（即趕騾轎車的）中人素有交往的，由那一路來的客商，坐的什麼人的車子，做的什麽買賣，只要騾車一進店，店主人已經知道個八九成了。同時開戲館子的老闆不時同各店主人往來周旋，彼此關照，莫不打成一片，倘若是來勾角的人稍不謹愼，露了馬脚，那頓時就要吃個大虧，而且能被打得屁滾尿流，銀物盡行拋棄，帶着重傷狼狽而回的。（七三）</p>

<h3>Japan Conducts Anti-British Movement; Craigie Lodges Strong Protest; Tokyo Round Table Conference Fears Difficulty in Continuing; Britain, the United States, and France Maintain Close Contact; British Member of Parliament Questions Negotiation Details</h3>
<p>(London) During the House of Commons session this afternoon, opposition Labour Party members Henderson and Baker questioned the progress of the Tokyo negotiations. Prime Minister Chamberlain responded immediately, stating, "Foreign Office official Butler reported on the progress of the Tokyo negotiations to the House of Commons last Monday, and there have been no changes since then. Regarding the anti-British demonstrations in North China, the government has instructed Sir Robert Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, to lodge another strong protest with the Japanese government." Henderson further asked, "Given the situation in the Far East, is the government in close contact with the governments of the United States and France?" Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "Yes." Baker then inquired about the extradition of four Chinese suspects in the Cheng Hsi-keng case. The Prime Minister replied that no decision had yet been made on this matter. Labour Party member Wedgwood then said, "Any action we take that appears to betray China may incite anti-British movements within China. I wonder if the Prime Minister can bear this in mind?" The Prime Minister did not answer. Liberal Party member Mander then inquired, "It is heard from Tianjin that two British women were forced by the Japanese to strip and be inspected. What does the government intend to do about this?" The Prime Minister replied, "I have not yet received an official report regarding this matter." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) During the House of Commons session this afternoon, opposition Labour Party member Bellenger inquired whether the Tokyo negotiations involved the issue of Chinese legal tender. Foreign Office official Butler immediately replied, "No, the current negotiations are limited to local issues in Tianjin." Bellenger then followed up, "Can the Prime Minister provide assurances stating that the British authorities will never allow Chinese legal tender to lose its legal status within the Tianjin Concession?" Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "This matter was explained in detail yesterday." Opposition Labour Party member Burke inquired, "There are widespread rumors that Britain intends to revoke the legal status of Chinese legal tender in Tianjin and transfer the silver reserves in the Concession to the Japanese side. Has the Japanese side made this suggestion? Can the Prime Minister clarify this?" Prime Minister Chamberlain replied, "Rumors are rampant at all times and in all places and should not be easily believed. When the House of Commons discussed the situation in China yesterday, I fully explained the British government's position. There is nothing more to add." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Office official Butler stated in the House of Commons today that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie, due to the various restrictions imposed by the Japanese naval and military authorities on British trade in the Yangtze River Delta, sent a letter to the Japanese government on June 6th to negotiate this case. As of now, a response has not yet been received from the Japanese government. The British government considers the problem extremely urgent and has requested Sir Robert Craigie to urge the Japanese government to respond quickly. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Craigie Declares British Viewpoint</h3>
<p>(London) According to Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, London has not yet indicated that it intends to terminate the Tokyo talks due to the anti-British movements occurring in the Japanese-controlled areas. However, the British government is deeply aware that the anti-British movements have made the Anglo-Japanese negotiations extremely difficult. Ambassador to Japan Craigie has made this point clear to the Japanese government, stating that if a harmonious atmosphere cannot be established, the success of the negotiations will be significantly hindered. It is heard that Craigie made the following statement when expressing the British viewpoint: The Japanese side has the responsibility to maintain public order in the areas it occupies, and the plan agreed upon in the Tokyo talks is based on the premise that the Japanese side will bear this responsibility. However, the current situation indicates that public order has not been maintained. From this perspective, the Japanese government seems unable or unwilling to maintain public order. If it is able to maintain it but does not, then the Japanese side is not fulfilling its obligations under this plan. If it is unable to maintain it, then the Japanese side should not claim that it is capable of maintaining it. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the report in the Nichi Nichi Shimbun that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie requested Kato, the Japanese representative to the Round Table Conference, to ask the Japanese government to strictly restrain the anti-British movements in China and Japan, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied it today, saying that the Nichi Nichi Shimbun's report was purely fabricated. According to British sources, Craigie did indeed raise concerns about the anti-British agitation recently, but he did not mention this matter during his conversation with Kato last night. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson also stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain's claim that those agitating against Britain in North China were under the influence and control of the Japanese was not true. It is reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday have been banned from publication in Japan. Japanese newspapers are prohibited from publishing them. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>US Chargé d'Affaires Also Protests to Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Nichi Nichi Shimbun, British Ambassador Craigie requested Kato, the leader of the Japanese delegation to the Round Table Conference, last night to ask the Japanese government to strictly restrain the anti-British movement in China, saying, "If not, the Anglo-Japanese talks may be difficult to continue." It is reported that the British Ambassador further requested that this intention be conveyed to Foreign Minister Arita. The newspaper also reported that at the same time, U.S. Chargé d'Affaires Dooman visited the Director of the American Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, explaining that the anti-British movement in China has now turned into an anti-white movement, endangering American expatriates in China, and requesting the Japanese government to fully restrain the anti-foreign movement in China. According to the newspaper, Mr. Kato replied to the British Ambassador that the anti-British activities and the Tokyo talks were two separate matters. The anti-British activities in Japan were spontaneous expressions of the people, and if they hindered the maintenance of peace and order, responsible Japanese officials would take appropriate measures to restrain them at any time. As for the activities of the Chinese people, they had nothing to do with the Japanese government. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reports from here, both the United Kingdom and the United States have protested to the Japanese government regarding the anti-British movement instigated by Japan in Japan and China. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun reported that Ambassador Craigie notified the Japanese government that under the current circumstances, it would be difficult for Britain to continue negotiations with Japan, and that the Japanese government had the power to restrain the anti-British movement and should not condone it. The Japanese side replied that the anti-British movement should not be confused with the Tokyo negotiations, and that the anti-British demonstrations were a natural expression of the people's will. Unless the actions were excessive and violated the law, the Japanese government could not restrain them. The U.S. protest stated that the anti-British movement in Japan had the intention of targeting the white race, and as a result, Americans residing in China were being subjected to sacrifices. It was hoped that Japan would restrain actions that attacked foreigners. Political figures here feel indignant that the UK and US have taken joint action, which obviously implies a demonstration of force. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Britain Does Not Yield on Economic Issues</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Asahi Shimbun reported that the British representatives on the Economic Issues Subcommittee acknowledged yesterday the historical background of the silver reserves in Tianjin and the special nature of the economy of North China, as expressed by the concentration of foreign exchange in the Joint Reserve Bank. The above-mentioned circumstances have been clarified by both sides through the exchange of documents. However, the British representatives are still holding a strong attitude, believing that economic issues have a serious impact on the United States, France, and other countries, not just Britain. Therefore, they show no sign of acceding to Japanese demands, and believe that acceding to them would be tantamount to acknowledging the "Interim Government" rather than the Chinese government. Given the obstinate attitude of the British side, it is almost useless for the Japanese representatives to proceed with the discussion of economic issues in the Round Table Conference. In this situation, only British Ambassador Craigie and the chief Japanese representative Kato can first hold private talks to pave the way for the Round Table Conference to proceed. Therefore, the Round Table Conference could not be held today. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent learned that while the transfer of Chinese silver in the British Concession in Tianjin had been mentioned in the Tokyo talks, the Japanese government has not yet made this request. If such a request were made, the British government would consult with the governments of other countries concerned, as Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons last Monday. Although the progress of the negotiations is being notified in detail to the French and American governments at all times, such consultations have not yet taken place. It is expected that the British government will issue instructions to Ambassador Craigie within days. (Reuters, 1st)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Comment on the Tianjin Silver Reserves Issue</h3>
<p>(London) The situation in the Far East continues to be a matter of special attention in London and local newspapers. The Birmingham Post reported that the issue of Chinese legal tender is of equal importance to other countries as it is to Britain. If we also regard it as a local incident, this issue will become "a thin edge of a very wide wedge." If this matter becomes the main issue in the Tokyo negotiations, it will undoubtedly be submitted to the governments of other countries in a practical form. However, the main point of contention at present seems to be the issue of the silver reserves in the British Concession in Tianjin, which is of a more limited nature. At the same time, the rumor that the British government intends to hand over the four Chinese who caused the Tianjin incident to the Japanese side can also be denied. No decision has been made at present, nor is it intended to be considered in the near future. The News Chronicle also published similar solemn remarks. The diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Mail commented on the recognition of the Chinese puppet government and the currency issue, saying that the Tokyo negotiations have clearly encountered a setback. French Ambassador to Japan Henri notified Japanese Foreign Minister Arita that the French government attaches great importance to this issue, and that if negotiations are held, a French representative must be present. London officialdom has firmly denied the news spread by the Japanese side that the British government has agreed to transfer the silver of the Central Government stored in the banks of the British Concession in Tianjin. According to the Tokyo correspondent of The Times, regarding the historical aspect of the silver issue, the Japanese side claimed that the silver reserves do not belong to the Chinese government but to the former Peiping local government. Because the Peiping government is now succeeded by a new regime under Japanese patronage, the silver reserves should legally belong to the new "government." According to Reuters, various Chinese circles in London do not feel seriously troubled by the currency or silver issues. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Foreign Minister and Finance Minister Exchange Opinions</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie and Japanese Envoy Plenipotentiary Kato met at the Tokyo Club from 4:45 PM to 6:10 PM today. At the same time, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita, Foreign Office official Sawada, Finance Minister Ishiwata, and Finance Office official Ono also gathered today to exchange opinions on various economic issues in Tianjin. Regarding the Japanese request that the British side prohibit the circulation of Chinese legal tender in the Tianjin Concession and hand over the Chinese silver in the hands of British banks, the Japanese side believes that Craigie must obtain instructions from his own government before he can make any statements. (AP, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Police Affairs Subcommittee Met Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Apart from the subcommittee on discussing police affairs in Tianjin, no other meetings were held today. It is said that this was necessary to extract the records of past resolution meetings. At the same time, Japanese newspapers all say that Britain now holds a difficult-to-understand and strong attitude towards the issues of legal tender and silver reserves, apparently disregarding the principles of the Arita-Craigie Agreement. The newspapers also draw attention to the "skillful" policy "that Britain is good at," attempting to threaten Japan by uniting with the United States. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Chang Pengchun Flies from US to UK; Recalls US Abolition of Treaty; Had Long Talk with US Secretary of State Before Departure</h3>
<p>(London) Professor of Chinese University and member of the People's Political Council, Mr. Chang Pengchun, arrived in England today by Yankee Clipper flying boat from New York, becoming the first Chinese to fly across the Atlantic. Mr. Chang told the Reuters reporter who visited him that his trip was only slightly delayed because the flying boat stopped in Newfoundland for a day. He initially did not fully believe that the U.S. abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty would prove to be a turning point in the war. Before leaving the U.S., Mr. Chang had a long talk with U.S. Secretary of State Hull. President Roosevelt was too busy with political affairs to meet him, but Hull relayed a letter stating, "I am very happy to know that you have good news to bring to the United States." Mr. Chang also told the Reuters reporter that at the last moment before his departure from the U.S., he was very uneasy. At that time, the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee was discussing Senator Vandenberg's resolution in favor of abolishing the U.S.-Japan treaty, but some people expressed opposition, and the result was yet to be determined. It was not until the evening that he learned that the majority supported the abolition of the treaty, so President Roosevelt decided to act, and the notice of abolition was announced that evening. Although this matter had the above-mentioned process, it was still generally regarded as surprising. The British ambassador did not know about this until the next morning. Mr. Chang continued, stating that there were two main reasons for the U.S. abolition of the treaty: (1) The U.S. government was willing to do its best to avoid actually provoking war and undermining peace, and to issue a direct warning to all dictators; (2) The U.S. government wanted to use this to express the American people's feelings about Japan's invasion of China. According to Mr. Chang, who has traveled all over the U.S. in recent months, the trend of the majority of the American people supporting action against Japan has undoubtedly been advancing day by day. It is said that the abolition of the treaty was unanimously welcomed by newspapers of all factions. President Roosevelt has clearly accomplished a popular thing. Mr. Chang also said that the U.S. is naturally very cautious about this decision to abolish the treaty. There is a very noteworthy feature at present, that is, all officials are strictly silent. The last time he was in the U.S., U.S. officials were discussing all aspects of the Chinese war. Now they have decided to act and no longer want to talk in vain. Mr. Chang also said that the experts of the U.S. government are now studying two points regarding the abolition of the treaty: (1) the issue of continuing to purchase surplus silver from Japan, which Japan wants to use to make up for its trade deficit in purchasing raw materials from the U.S.; (2) the tariff issue for Japanese goods exported to the U.S., such as cloth and raw silk. Mr. Chang concluded by saying that he believes that the meaning of the U.S. abolition of the treaty is actually an invitation to Britain to take the same action. If Britain cannot take a firm attitude in the Far East, the U.S. will be extremely disappointed. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Guo Presents Memorandum to Britain Regarding Silver Reserves Issue Reaffirming Government's Attitude</h3>
<p>(London) According to the political correspondent of the Yorkshire Post, Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi has, upon the instructions of the National Government, delivered a memorandum to the British Foreign Office. The memorandum first raised the issue of the silver reserves in the Tianjin Concession. The amount of silver deposited by Chinese in British and French banks in Tianjin is very large, worth as much as £800,000. The British government had previously stated that the scope of the Tokyo negotiations would not extend beyond the issue of the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin and related incidents. Therefore, if the Anglo-Japanese negotiations discuss the issue of the transfer of silver reserves, it would clearly exceed the scope and be difficult to avoid going back on its word. The correspondent also stated that last night, when Ambassador Guo delivered the memorandum, he met with Foreign Secretary Halifax to reaffirm the attitude of the Chinese government. The Foreign Secretary assured that the British government is determined to respect China's rights and interests regarding the monetary system. It is heard that in the memorandum sent by Ambassador Guo, the strongest criticism was directed at the British recognition that the Japanese army in China has certain rights and interests due to maintaining order and protecting its own safety. China believes that the Japanese army's occupation of Chinese territory is a violation of sacred treaties and has no justifiable reason. (Haitong, 2nd)</p>

<h3>New China's Economic Construction Movement</h3>
<p>China's economic development during the past twenty-five months of war has created a new era in history. Before the war, China's economic situation was generally more prosperous in the coastal areas, while the inland areas were mostly poor. After the outbreak of the war, although the economic organizations in the coastal areas were destroyed by artillery fire, the economic center of gravity gradually shifted to the inland areas. As a result, the inland areas have transformed from poverty to prosperity, and have gradually entered the stage of industrialization from purely agricultural production. Thus, the economic activities in the inland areas, on the one hand, supported the huge financial consumption during the war period; on the other hand, they shouldered various construction tasks. The greatness of its power and the speed of its development cannot be estimated by anyone.</p>
<p>The government has not yet been able to make a concrete and detailed report on the economic development of the inland areas; however, by examining various scattered materials, one can get a general glimpse of the general status of its activities. First of all, in terms of transportation, the transportation in the northwest and southwest has always been backward. Now, on the land side, highways are distributed like a spider web, among which the Northwest Highway and the Burma Road have become international trunk lines. It is estimated that in the past two years, the newly built highways in the southwest have reached 7,500 miles. In terms of railway construction, in addition to the old Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, there are also the Xukun, Yunnan-Burma, Chengyu, Xianggui, Xiangqian, Dianqian, Chuanqian, and Chuankang Railways, which have either been opened to traffic or are still under construction. The Mengsu Railway has recently been completed in the Northwest. The Longxin, Baoning, Baocheng, and Baolan lines are still being planned or constructed. Air transportation has been connected with the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. Secondly, in terms of industry, the inland areas, which were once regarded as barren, can now hear the rumbling of machines everywhere. For example, the ancient city of Chongqing has now become a newly emerging industrial city. According to a survey by the China National Economic Research Institute, in the past two years, there have been 472 factories in the three provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan with newly created industries with capital of more than 20,000 yuan. In terms of agriculture, the government has recently devoted itself to the reform of agricultural technology and agricultural loans. According to a report from the Ministry of Economic Affairs, agricultural products have increased greatly in recent years. For example, wheat in Shaanxi increased by 12 million dan last year compared to the previous year, and cotton in Sichuan increased by more than 900,000 dan last year. In terms of mining, the underground in the northwest and southwest contains various large amounts of resources, and the government is still working on development. For example, gold in Xikang, and oil and coal in Sichuan and Shaanxi are all being actively mined. In terms of commerce, due to the government's legal management, such as the balance of prices, the adjustment of transportation production and sales, and the control of exports and imports, foreign trade has become a surplus under the various customs controlled by the government. At the same time, domestic trade has also become increasingly prosperous with the prosperity of various industries in the country. China's inland areas are the richest treasure house, but in the past they were neglected by the Chinese people for various reasons. Now, due to the War of Resistance, they can be developed as much as possible, which is not necessarily a blessing in disguise for the Chinese nation. President Chiang Kai-shek recently stated when meeting with foreign reporters that China is now capable of fighting the war independently in terms of military affairs and economy without relying on foreign aid, which shows that the entire economy has had an amazing development!</p>
<p>In the economic construction movement to create a new China, the most active force is naturally the government, which is in charge of the overall plan for resisting the war and building the country. She is making continuous efforts to achieve the greatest achievements in various economic activities under state ownership. This year, in order to focus on economic construction, the government issued 600 million yuan of construction bonds as a fund for various state-owned enterprises. For private enterprises, the government guides and encourages the people in various ways. For example, in order to develop industry, the government has guided the people to engage in the industrial cooperative movement. It is said that in the seven months after the establishment of the China Industrial Cooperative Association, more than 300 industrial cooperatives were established in the northwest and southwest to help the people engage in various small-scale industries. The second is the hard work and efforts of the people of the whole country. Overseas Chinese and residents in various places have tried their best to transfer funds to the inland areas, and various scientific and technical personnel have not avoided sacrifices to serve their motherland. Malaria is rampant in the southwestern border areas, which has always been regarded as a daunting task. Now, many entrepreneurs and scientists have gone to investigate and survey. This patriotic spirit is no less than that of soldiers who charge into battle. In addition, international assistance is also a major driving force. The construction of many important transportation projects relies on the investment of friendly countries. The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund has helped the Chinese government to investigate resources in various border areas and train various technical talents, which has made indelible contributions.</p>
<p>At present, only a part of the people in the occupied areas seem to have not yet exerted their full efforts in this new economic construction movement promoted by the entire nation. Some of them escape with funds to the concessions to engage in various speculative activities; others escape to foreign countries in order to seek future security; or they temporarily suspend production in order to quickly restore peace. They do not use useful funds to help the government engage in the national construction movement, which is inevitably a loss to the country. From the perspective of current interests, all economic activities in the occupied areas not only have no opportunity for development, but also have extremely great dangers. Japan's blockade of the entire Chinese coast will inevitably cut off trade between Europe and the United States and China. In order to prevent aiding the enemy, the Chinese government will also strengthen the economic isolation of the occupied areas. If the economic relations between the occupied areas and domestic and foreign countries are cut off, what way out is there! What's more, all economic activities in the occupied areas are completely under the control of others. For example, industry uses the name of "cooperation," which is tantamount to offering assets to others. The purchase, transportation, and sales of agricultural products cannot escape the oppression of so-called "control." According to reports, Suiyuan has been forced to grow opium in order to extract exorbitant taxes, causing great losses to farmers, which is a clear example. As for transportation related to military transport, it is entirely under control, which goes without saying. In short, in the current process of New China's resistance to the war and national construction, if the people in the occupied areas want to save themselves, they must first save their own country and use their own blood and sweat to promote the economic construction movement of New China. In Shanghai, a special environment where floating capital is concentrated, wealthy people should rise up to find ways to promote it, and the harvest of practical effects can be guaranteed.</p>
<h3>British Credit Loan to China: Negotiations Approaching Maturity; Technical and Minor Issues Awaiting Chinese Response Before Decision; Secretary of Commerce Stanley Answers Questions in the House of Commons</h3>
<p>(London) Secretary of Commerce Stanley stated in the House of Commons today, in response to questions, that negotiations on proposals to guarantee British manufacturers' exports to China have been ongoing for some time, and that certain technical and legal issues are still under consideration. The questioner was Labor MP Henderson, who asked whether the British government had proposed guarantees to the Chinese government, to aid China, for the purchase of British goods in accordance with agreements between the British government and other governments. After Stanley's response, Henderson further asked whether he would make a statement before the House adjourns on August 4. Stanley replied that he could not specify when he would speak, as there were technical and legal issues, some of which depended on receiving a response from China. Henderson asked if these were not particularly important issues, as the Chinese government's purchases had been restricted for the past eighteen months. Stanley replied that it depended on the response received. (Reuter, 1st)</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Attaches Importance to Chinese Statements</p>
<p>During the House of Commons session in London today, Labor MP Belenger questioned Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon regarding a statement issued on June 8 by the Hong Kong Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Committee concerning Chinese legal tender, which stated, "There will be no problem with the authorities' ability to maintain foreign exchange." He asked if this could still represent the opinion of the British government. The Chancellor replied that this statement was not issued by the British government, and the British government had not expressed any opinion on the future exchange rate of Chinese legal tender. Belenger then recalled that the Chancellor had previously cited the aforementioned statement from Hong Kong, including its wording, and stated that he did not know if the Chancellor had any intention in citing this statement, knowing that the Chinese legal tender had continued to depreciate since his citation. The Chancellor replied that, as he recalled, Belenger had asked for information, and he had provided the statement issued by China. Belenger further asked what the Chancellor meant by mentioning this statement, even though he did not consider it entirely accurate. The Chancellor replied that he considered most of the statement to be a declaration about future conditions, and that one must pay attention to the opinions expressed by the relevant national authorities regarding their own currency. (Reuter, 1st)</p>
<p>No Change in Policy Towards China</p>
<p>Following the explanations of financial and commercial perspectives on China policy by Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon and Secretary of Commerce Stanley yesterday, various morning newspapers prominently commented, asserting that other countries' attempts to prevent Britain from economically assisting China had no further effect. The diplomatic affairs reporter for the London Times declared, "While the statements of Chancellor Simon and Secretary Stanley contain nothing new or surprising, they are accurate considering that certain countries, including Germany, have entered into commercial agreements with China during its difficult times. However, there have been misunderstandings regarding the preliminary agreement reached between Britain and Japan in Tokyo, with some even claiming that Britain is no longer assisting China, making these statements beneficial. The British government's desire to maintain its original China policy, while also establishing temporary measures with the Japanese authorities in North China, demonstrates sincerity. In essence, these temporary measures do not constitute a policy, merely establishing 'rules' for daily relations between Britain and Japan." The Financial News reported, "Well-informed sources here generally believe that the British government will again provide export credit loans to China, and its attitude towards Chinese trade and currency issues has not fundamentally changed, which can be demonstrated here. However, the response from Japan and the impact of the negotiations underway in Tokyo on Anglo-Japanese relations are of interest here." (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>British Lending to Japan</p>
<p>During the House of Commons session in London this afternoon, opposition Labor MP Price questioned Chancellor Simon, "Japan is purchasing wool and other raw materials from the Commonwealth of Australia, financed by loans from certain banks in London. Is the Chancellor aware of this? And can he take necessary measures to halt such financial assistance, and have Britain purchase a portion of this wool and raw materials for its own war preparations?" Chancellor Simon replied, "I do not believe the claim that London banks have increased the amount of credit extended to Japan." (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>Importance of Supporting Chinese Legal Tender</p>
<p>A political correspondent for the London Financial News, referring to Secretary of Commerce Stanley's statement in the House of Commons that proposals to provide guarantees to British manufacturers to benefit exports to China have been under consideration for some time, stated that well-informed sources therefore expect the British government to eventually lend export credit to China, as this would demonstrate that Britain's attitude towards the trade and financial situation in China has not fundamentally changed. Many believe that if Japan attempts to force Britain to abandon its support for Chinese legal tender as the price for resolving the Tianjin incident, Britain's stance on this will be a major test of its future policy towards China. France has indicated that it will support and align with any action Britain takes on this issue. The British government is currently awaiting Washington's opinion on this matter. There is a strong sentiment in political circles that if Britain concedes to Japan's monetary demands, Tokyo will achieve a significant diplomatic victory, and Britain's prestige in the East will suffer severe damage. The most relevant sectors in this city are currently giving close consideration to the issue of Britain's support for Chinese legal tender. What can be said now is that the representatives of British trade and finance strongly advocate for continued support, even if this involves various difficulties, it is worth doing. Many feel that Japan's control of exports and customs revenue, as well as the flight of Chinese capital, seem to require a large expenditure to maintain the stability of the legal tender. At the same time, it is also felt that the Chinese government can still find ways to close major loopholes. One point that should be clearly stated is that supporting legal tender is only a matter of a limited time. Because existing signs show that Japan's economic exhaustion is not far off. Well-informed sources also point out that even if the equalization fund is replenished, these increased resources will be lost again. However, this loss is insignificant compared to all British assets and interests in China. If China is incorporated into the yen bloc, British assets and interests in China will not be protected and will never be recovered. If the foreign exchange controls currently imposed by Japan in North China are allowed to extend to other parts of China, British trade with China, which was more than 15 million pounds even under last year's wartime conditions, will be lost without hope of recovery, and British capital in China, estimated at as much as 250 million pounds, will also be difficult to maintain. All these reasons are sufficient to show the necessity for Britain to continue to independently assist China's foreign exchange. All parties are now urging that Britain should take joint action with other signatories of the Nine-Power Treaty to maintain the open door in China. (Reuter, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspaper Praises America's Treaty Abolition</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily News today praised the attitude of the New York Times, Washington Star, and Baltimore Sun newspapers toward the U.S. abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty, stating that "the American public's unanimous support for the U.S. government's action to abolish the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty cannot be called a great event in history, because this is how the United States expresses its attitude toward Japanese aggression, whether from a moral standpoint or from its own interests, it has reached the point of being unbearable." It also stated that "since the European War, although the United States has always adopted the traditional policy of not interfering in other people's affairs in Europe, it has often adopted a policy of active leadership in the Far East. The U.S. abolition of the U.S.-Japan Commercial Treaty is a powerful action by the U.S. against Japan. Since Washington sent a dispatch to Tokyo last winter, requesting Japan to maintain the open door policy, the U.S.'s Far East policy has become clearer. We firmly believe that in the second half of this year, the U.S. will definitely adopt a more severe policy towards Japan. Finally, the U.S.'s decision to take action against Japan and the improvement of international relations are also due to our resolute resistance and unyielding efforts, so we firmly believe that if we can do our best to engage in the war of resistance, international assistance will definitely continue to come until we achieve final victory."

At the same time, the local "Anti-British Committee" sent letters to 516 Chinese servants in Beiping's British community and British shops, informing them that if they did not resign, they would be dealt with in a final action. Some Chinese servants have resigned as a result. The British Embassy has lodged representations with the Japanese Embassy. (Reuter, 2nd)</p>

<h3>German Widow Mrs. Taulder in Qingdao Forced to Relocate by Japanese Troops; Small Apartment Operated by Mrs. Taulder Occupied; German Community in Qingdao Extremely Indignant</h3>
<p>(Qingdao) Mrs. Taulder, a German widow who has been operating a small apartment here for 30 years, was forced to move out by Japanese troops on July 27. Mrs. Taulder's livelihood depended entirely on the income from this small apartment. After this blow, she suffered a great mental shock and seemed to be insane. The German consulate sent her to a hospital in the city for treatment. It is reported that the Japanese have coveted Mrs. Taulder's house for 18 months. In the meantime, she had been repeatedly warned by the authorities, ordering her to hand over the house, claiming that the house belonged to the former Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie and should be returned to the Japanese. However, Mrs. Taulder repeatedly refused the Japanese request, stating that she had leased the house from a certain owner and that her livelihood depended entirely on it. On July 27, the Japanese broke into her house, threw out all her furniture, and finally drove Mrs. Taulder out. Mrs. Taulder had nowhere to go and stayed at the German consulate for a few days before resting in a certain hospital. It is reported that the German community here is extremely indignant about this matter. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Chinese Entering Shameen in Guangzhou Still Subject to Inspection</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) Chinese people entering and leaving the British and French concessions in Shameen are still subject to strict inspection. Reuters staff residing in the city have recently had to wait in line for inspection every morning, taking as long as three hours to enter Shameen. The Japanese have offered varying explanations for the inspections. The Japanese Consul-General in Guangzhou stated that the purpose was to prevent local currency from being smuggled into Shameen for speculative purposes, while a Japanese spokesman told reporters that the measure was to ensure that all Chinese passing through the British concession were vaccinated against the plague. The Japanese have also published an article on the matter, stating that since the outbreak of the plague in Hong Kong, there have been 256 cases and 200 deaths. The British authorities are very concerned about the epidemic and have collected a compulsory vaccination fee of five cents from each resident, but this has failed to reduce the epidemic. They are now planning to move impoverished Chinese people away from Hong Kong, causing widespread dissatisfaction among the Chinese with the Hong Kong authorities. It is reported that some Chinese, in order to avoid inspection, are traveling by small boat to the Eastern Embankment from the concession, but they are also being stopped by the Japanese, as the waterways are now patrolled by the Japanese. According to some foreigners in Shameen, the Japanese's strict inspections are the starting point for isolating the foreign concessions. However, Reuters has learned from the Japanese consulate and the Japanese military authorities that the Japanese have no such intention. At the same time, rumors that Chinese employees of British businesses and British homes have been threatened, but this has not yet been confirmed. (Reuter, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Four Banks Form Committee to Control Remittances</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to sources close to the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China are now establishing a domestic remittance control committee under the guidance of the Ministry of Finance to restrict the flow of legal tender from areas controlled by the National Government to the coastal areas. However, remittances required for the purchase of goods within the scope of import restriction regulations are still permitted. It is reported that the committee will begin work next week. All remittances from the interior to the coastal areas, including funds to Shanghai, must be reviewed by the committee. Remittances required for the purchase of goods must comply with the import restriction regulations. In other words, remittances are only allowed for goods that are essential for people's livelihoods. The procedure is that when remitting funds, the remitter must first state the purpose and use of the remittance. The committee will then investigate the seller in the coastal area to confirm the statement, and then the remittance will be approved. (Associated Press, 2nd)</p>

<p>(Beiping) As a result of several days of continuous heavy rain, the canal embankment has collapsed in many places, and floods have caused a disaster. Between Beiping and Tianjin, 150 villages have been affected, and more than 50,000 people have been displaced. Several thousand refugees have gathered outside Beiping. The "Provincial Government" plans to raise one million yuan to provide relief to the victims. (Haitong Dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Organization of the British, French and Soviet Front Against German Dissension; Soviet Union Explains Reason for Negotiation Stagnation; Definition of Aggression Should Not Leave Room for Loopholes; Germany Plans to Lure the Soviet Union to Neutrality, But Its Plan is Difficult to Achieve</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the progress of the negotiations for a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, a correspondent for the News Chronicle stationed in Berlin recently wired stating, "According to reliable sources, German leader Hitler and his entourage are currently considering a plan. The content of this plan involves Germany guaranteeing the territorial integrity of the Soviet Union, while the Soviet Union guarantees neutrality in future wars, as a condition of exchange. The German side attaches great importance to the possibility of breaking apart the Soviet Union from Britain and France. If this plan succeeds, the wavering members of the British Conservative Party, who do not want to act too hastily, will certainly use all their strength to advocate for immediate, strong action. On the other hand, if the Soviet Union agrees to remain neutral, the current crisis between Germany and Poland will break out immediately, and Germany will certainly take sudden action. Conversely, if the Soviet Union refuses to accept this German plan, Hitler will not abandon the various demands he has made to Poland, but will seek other ways to achieve his goals," (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to reports, British Under-Secretary of State Butler stated in Parliament on July 31 that the British government has strived to quickly eliminate various distinctive differences between Britain and the Soviet Union, and the main issue is whether we should infringe on the independence of the Baltic states. Butler said, "I agree that we should not do so, and the main reason for the delay in negotiations lies in formal differences." TASS is hereby ordered to declare that if Butler indeed said this, it is a misrepresentation of the Soviet government's attitude. The actual difference does not lie in the question of whether to infringe on the independence of the Baltic states, as both sides have agreed to guarantee this independence. Rather, it lies in the definition of "indirect aggression," which should not leave loopholes for aggressors attempting to harm the independence of the Baltic states. The British definition leaves such loopholes, which is one of the reasons for the delay in negotiations. (TASS, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the negotiations between the staff officers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons this afternoon that the British military delegation will depart for Moscow on the 5th or 6th of this month. (Havas, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) General Dumonck, commander of the garrison of Lille, has been ordered to lead a military delegation to Moscow to hold talks with representatives of the staff officers of Britain and the Soviet Union. He was recently received by Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense Daladier. The content of the talks was not disclosed. Afterwards, General Dumonck also participated in an important technical meeting to discuss the procedures for the Moscow talks. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) An official announced that the size and scope of the British military delegation sent to Moscow are even greater than what Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons yesterday. The representatives are scheduled to gather here tomorrow and hold a meeting before departure, chaired by Lieutenant General Gort, Chief of the Imperial General Staff. They will then travel to Paris on the 3rd or 4th of this month to meet with members of the French military delegation before heading to Moscow. Soviet officials are somewhat disappointed that there are no more prominent figures in the British military delegation. However, they are also pleased that the representatives are all technical experts who can conclude a concrete agreement with the Soviet staff officers regarding measures to prevent "indirect aggression," and it is hoped that practical terms can be established. However, it is stated that the military and political agreements of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must be established simultaneously. Individuals in the British government state that the definition of "indirect aggression" recently proposed by Soviet People's Commissar Molotov is still too rigid. Britain and France are about to propose a counter-proposal that takes into account various forms of indirect aggression, similar to Germany's treatment of Bohemia and Moravia as protectorates, while still respecting the independence of the Baltic states. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<h3>Britain Abandons Appeasement Policy, Relying Solely on Facts for Advancement and Retreat</h3>
<p>(London) Former Foreign Secretary Eden wrote to the people of his constituency, saying, "The policy of appeasement has been deeply buried. The government is now engaged in a policy of establishing a peace front to resist continued acts of aggression. In the coming weeks, there will undoubtedly be a series of rumors, some optimistic and some pessimistic. Others will assure us that there is no crisis of war and will threaten us with the dangers we will encounter if we do not act as they instruct. However, this kind of strategy is not liked by the British people. We will no longer trust promises and guarantees, but will rely solely on facts for advancement and retreat. The responsibility of British politicians today is to make the rulers and people of Germany and Italy recognize our unwavering determination. If we can do this and make others understand the true nature of the British people, war will not occur." (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Germany Plots and Plans to Seize Danzig; Troops Concentrated and Awaiting Orders; Plans to be Implemented Step by Step</h3>
<p>Danzig: Germany has already practiced troop drills in the suburbs of the city, completing the first step in its plan to reclaim Danzig. It is reported that the Germans are now trying to gain economic control of Danzig. It is generally believed that their primary goal is to remove the Polish customs inspectors on the border between Danzig and East Prussia and allow German goods to enter freely. The Danzig newspapers controlled by the National Socialist Party are currently making this demand. The first Jewish concentration camp in Danzig has been opened in the border area, employing hundreds of Jews in the camp to build barracks, paying them low wages, providing ample food, and treating them relatively well. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Polish sources here claim that there are currently 15,000 troops in the Free City of Danzig, of which 8,000 have recently infiltrated the city from Germany. In addition, Germany has concentrated 400,000 troops in Bohemia and Moravia. All of this indicates that the Danzig issue is about to become tense. Furthermore, news from Berlin states that the garrison of the German western "Siegfried" Line is already at full strength, which suggests that relations between Poland and Germany are likely to become strained.

<h3>150,000 Italian Army Troops Conduct Exercises in the Po River Basin; Mountain Warfare Targets France as the Hypothetical Enemy; Simultaneously, German Air Force Studies in the Northwest</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian army began large-scale exercises in the Po River basin at midnight today. The participating forces include several corps of mechanized and "armored" units, as well as thirty battalions of Fascist Party militia, totaling 150,000 troops. General Bastico, a mountain youth officer (who participated in the civil war in Spain), is in command. Italian Undersecretary of the Army Pariani, Air Force Chief Valerio, Chief of the General Staff Badoglio, and Governor of Italian Libya Balbo are serving as judges. German Chief of the General Staff Halder, Hungarian Chief of the General Staff Werth, and a Spanish military delegation have also come to observe. Several days prior to the exercise, Italian army authorities had taken various military measures in the Po River basin, and troops were stationed at all important strongholds. Heavy trucks, artillery units, and infantry and cavalry units were constantly on the move. This exercise focuses on defending against an attack from France, assuming that the enemy is attacking Turin from the Alps and, after breaking through the Italian defense lines at Mont Cenis and Little St Bernard Pass, is invading Piedmont. The Italian army will immediately rush to the scene, fight the "enemy" on a 70-kilometer front, drive them back, and pursue them westward across the Alps. The exercise will then conclude. According to military experts here, the Italian mechanized forces only showed their prowess briefly during the Spanish Civil War, and the number of troops participating at that time was not enough to accurately determine their effectiveness. Therefore, a large number of mechanized units have been mobilized in this exercise to test their operation and deployment to the front lines as if joining a battle. (Havas, 1st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German Air Force is conducting large-scale exercises in the northwest near Oldenburg, which will continue until the 5th of this month. The theme of the exercise assumes that a western country, i.e., the "Blue" country, is at war with the "Red" country, which is located east of the Elbe River. Between them is a "Green" country that maintains neutrality and is respected by both belligerents. To the north is a "Yellow" country whose neutral status has been violated by the "Red" country. The "Blue" country's air force then flies over the airspace of the "Yellow" country and engages in fierce aerial combat with the "Red" country's air force. Regarding the results of this aerial combat, the official here recently issued a communique stating, "The anti-aircraft artillery was extremely effective during the exercise, and the barrier network formed by reconnaissance aircraft was also very effective."

<h3>British Admiralty Announces Expansion of Shipbuilding Program; Adding 180 Ships of Various Sizes; Estimated Cost of £11 Million</h3>
<p>(London) Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty Shakespeare stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question from Labour MP Ammon that the government has decided to greatly increase the 1939 naval shipbuilding program, which will include 107 net-laying vessels for minesweeping and anti-submarine defense, of which 20 will be specially built for this purpose. The other 87 will be purchased as old ships or modified. The estimated cost of this increase is £11 million. Shakespeare continued, "Our shipbuilding program is subject to the events of the program announced earlier this year, as departing from this program would violate naval limitation treaties." Shakespeare also said that in addition to the aforementioned minesweepers, it is also proposed to build 56 whaling ship-type warships for patrol and anti-submarine defense, as well as 10 more minesweepers, 6 barrage defense ships, and 1 cable ship. Therefore, the total number of new ships in the above plan is 180, and a floating dock that can accommodate small ships of up to 5,000 tons has already been purchased. In addition, there are plans in progress, but details cannot be announced at this time, but they will be announced as soon as possible. The funds for this increase in shipbuilding will be allocated from the supplementary budget for the second half of this year. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British Fleet Visits Turkey; Receives Enthusiastic Welcome</h3>
<p>Istanbul: A squadron of British ships, led by Admiral Cunningham's flagship "Warspite," arrived here today and anchored outside the port of the Bosphorus. The flagship was guarded by four destroyers. Almost the entire Turkish fleet, led by Admiral Okan, sailed from Izmit and welcomed the British fleet outside the Princes' Islands, escorting the fleet to its anchorage. The authorities are also preparing a grand formal welcome, which will last until Sunday, including Admiral Cunningham flying to the Turkish capital Ankara to attend a formal banquet and meet with the Turkish president. The Turkish public is extremely pleased with the British fleet's visit, and newspapers are welcoming the "British friends" with enthusiastic articles. (Haitong News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Conflicts on the Romanian-Hungarian Border; Navigation Negotiations Stalled</h3>
<p>Bucharest: It is reported that the Romanian government has decided to sever trade relations with Hungary because of two clashes between Romanian and Hungarian patrols on the banks of the Tisza River, which divides the Romanian and Ruthenian borders, on the evening of Sunday. The Romanian-Hungarian negotiations, which had been underway for months of difficult preparations, had just resumed in Sinaia a few days ago, but have now been postponed indefinitely. According to a Romanian announcement, this conflict was caused by a Hungarian barge that violated the agreement and tried to enter Romanian territory by force. The border guards tried to stop it, but the barge did not listen, so they opened fire. The barge, with the help of the Hungarian water patrol, also returned fire. The gunfire continued throughout the night, and the number of casualties is still unknown. According to Hungarian news, the Romanian side used rifles and machine guns to fire at the Hungarian guards in the Deakso area and on a bridge over the Tisza River. The Hungarian side also returned fire, which stopped at 7:00 this morning. It is reported that one Hungarian soldier was injured. Currently, the gun muzzles on the Romanian side are all pointing towards Deakso. It is reported that the seriousness of the two conflicts on Monday night is unprecedented. Since Hungary occupied Ruthenia, the navigation of rafts has been temporarily suspended pending the conclusion of a new navigation agreement between Romania and Hungary to replace the old Romanian-Czech agreement. However, many residents of Ruthenia make a living by selling wood, so rafts often attempt to pass through the area at night, leading to frequent incidents recently. It is claimed that Hungary has proposed appointing a joint military commission to determine the cause of this shooting in order to restore normal relations in the area. (Reuters, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's New Deal Suffers Major Setback; Economic Recovery Bill Shelved in the House of Representatives</h3>
<p>(Washington) The government had previously submitted a bill requesting Congress to allow it to spend $3 billion to promote domestic economic recovery. The Senate amended and passed this bill yesterday, reducing the amount of funds to $1,615,000,000, and immediately transferred it to the House of Representatives for discussion. The House of Representatives recently decided by a majority of 193 votes to 166 votes to temporarily not include this bill on the agenda for this session. Political figures commented that the government has suffered a major setback. (Havas, 1st)</p>

<h3>Recent Traffic Conditions in Guilin; The Li River is Rising and Boat Travel is Very Convenient; Guangzhou Bay is an Important Gateway to Guilin</h3>
<p>Guilin Correspondence: Since the Hengyang-Guilin section of the Xiang-Gui Railway opened to traffic last year, officials from both the north and the south, as well as merchants, have gathered in Guilin. After the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, the central government established the Southwest Headquarters in Guilin, which, together with Kunming and Chongqing, formed a three-legged situation. As a result, Guilin has become the center of military and political affairs. Those traveling to Chongqing mostly use Guilin as a hub. However, after the destruction of the roads along the Guangdong-Guangxi border, it has become difficult to travel from Guangdong to Guilin by car. Fortunately, the main provincial roads have not been destroyed, and the main lines connecting Longzhou, Nanning, Liuzhou, Guilin, and Pingle are still operating as usual. However, there is overcrowding of passengers and goods, a shortage of vehicles, and high prices. Traveling on these main roads is not something that ordinary people can afford. The only thing that sustains the traffic in Guilin is the Guilin River, also known as the Li River, and commonly known as the Fu River. It originates on the border of Hunan, flows through Quanzhou, Guilin, Yangshuo, and Pingle, and winds down to Wuzhou, where it merges with the big river. The upper reaches of the Li River are shallow and have many shoals, making it extremely difficult for ships to navigate. Ordinary transportation of goods and passengers is mostly done by civilian boats. However, every year during the spring and summer, the Li River rises, usually from April to September. During these six months, electric ferries can travel directly from Wuzhou to Pingle. Those traveling from Wuzhou to Guilin can take an electric ferry to Pingle and then transfer to a civilian boat or a bus on the Ping-Gui Highway to reach Guilin. This is relatively more convenient than other routes. Since the beginning of summer, Guilin Province has experienced continuous heavy rain, and the western rivers have risen sharply. Ships on all rivers are able to travel smoothly. Recently, electric ferries such as Donghu, Lihang, Guangli, and Yongantai have been operating between Wuzhou and Pingle. The departure times from Wuzhou and Pingle are both at 8:00 p.m. every day. Ordinary seat passengers pay 10 yuan in national currency per person, with a 20% discount. If Guilin currency is paid, it is converted to 16 yuan. Berth tickets are charged at the original price plus a 30% surcharge, which is twice as expensive as usual. It takes two days to travel from Wuzhou to Pingle by ferry. After arriving in Pingle, it takes three or four hours by bus on the Ping-Gui Highway to reach Guilin. Calculating the total time for the water and land journey from Wuzhou to Guilin, it takes at most three days to arrive, which is more economical and saves time compared to traveling from Guixian or Nanning, making it more convenient. Since the Pearl River waterway was blockaded by the Japanese army, those traveling from Guangdong to Guilin cannot travel directly up the Pearl River and must detour. They can either take a ferry from Macau through Kaiping and then turn into Zhaoqing and go up to Wuzhou, or take the route through Guangzhou Bay, passing through Suixi and Lianjiang and entering Yulin Guixian. Those traveling light with fewer luggage often take the Kaiping route, but there is a risk of encountering harassment from Japanese and puppet troops when crossing the ferry at Luzhou, but it is fast. Those with heavy luggage and many items mostly take the Guangzhou Bay route, because the roads in Guangzhou Bay are safe, and there is a Guangdong-Guangxi joint transportation station where porters can be hired to transport heavy goods and luggage. It is easier to gather them there compared to other places. Recently, most of the ordinary goods transferred from Hong Kong to Guilin are transported through Yulin via Guangzhou Bay. In effect, Guangzhou Bay has become a commercial port for Guilin Province.</p>
<h3>Japanese Confiscate Jiangyin Power Plant; Managed by the Central China Company</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: The North Gate Waihua Ming Electric Light Company's plant and machinery were not damaged when the war broke out the year before last. The power plant's organization was originally funded by Wu Tinglu and others, with each share worth 100 yuan. It is now being forcibly managed by the "Central China Electric Steam Company" organized by the Japanese. The Japanese special task force in Suzhou has notified that all holders of Hua Ming Power Plant stock certificates, in their capacity as shareholders, should contact and register with the Jiangyin puppet county government before the end of the month to discuss cooperation. Shareholders who are in other cities can be given an extension of five days until August 5. If they exceed the deadline, it will be considered abandonment, and the ownership of the power plant will be confiscated by the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Xinsheng Tragically Bombed</h3>
<p>More Than 40 Students Killed; More Than 100 Residents Killed</p>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence: Since the fall of Jiaxing, Xinsheng County, which belongs to Jiaxing County, has been repeatedly harassed by the Japanese army. At 3:00 p.m. on the 28th of this month, the town was attacked by two Japanese planes from Jiaxing. They circled and reconnoitered over the city before dropping more than 30 large and small bombs. A certain elementary school was bombed and destroyed. At that time, the school was in session, so all of the more than 40 students were killed. More than 100 male and female residents were also killed. Countless houses were destroyed. The reason for the bombing of the town was that on the evening of the 27th and the morning of the 28th, a large number of Chinese troops traveled by boat from Jiaxing to a certain place via Xinsheng. The traitors learned of this and secretly reported it to the Japanese. The Japanese army dispatched planes after receiving the report, resulting in the unprecedented tragedy.</p>
<h3>Wuxi "Puppet Government" Issues County Resident Certificates; Cumbersome Procedures Cause People to Avoid</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: The Wuxi puppet "county government" has recently been urged by the Japanese army's special task force to issue so-called county resident certificates, following the example of Jiangyin and Wujin. The effect of the certificate is the same as a pass. Those who obtain a county resident certificate can travel to various ports without having to obtain a pass. However, the procedures for obtaining the certificate are quite difficult. Those who want to obtain the certificate must be investigated by the local "Baojia chief" and deemed to be good citizens with legitimate occupations. They must also be reviewed, and someone must be sent to secretly investigate. Then, the "Baojia chief" must be responsible for guaranteeing them before the certificate can be issued. It is said that the implementation is imminent. Those who do not obtain the certificate will not be allowed to reside there. Residents in the city are mostly outraged upon hearing the news. Also, because it is difficult to obtain a certificate, and there are many unemployed people, some have fled to the countryside, viewing residing in the city as a danger.</p>
<h3>Civilians Massacred at Henglin Station on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Unable to Find Chinese Troops; Innocent Farmers Suffer</p>
<p>Wujin Correspondence: The Nanjing-Shanghai train run by the Japanese army was ambushed by the troops of Zhang Shaohua and the Dadao troops of Gao Kangjiaren near Henglin Station the day before yesterday. The Japanese military cars at the front suffered heavy damage, and many people were killed. The next day, a large number of Japanese troops arrived from Nanjing and Shanghai and searched the nearby villages for traces of Chinese troops, but the Chinese troops had long since disappeared. The Japanese troops arrested about two or three hundred innocent farmers from each village, pierced a hole in the palm of their hands with a bayonet, threaded a thick lead wire through the hole, and ordered them to be taken to Nanjing. Later, a Japanese major considered that there were too many people and that they were too cumbersome, so he stabbed about 100 people to death with a bayonet at Henglin Station. It was truly a tragic sight.</p>
<h3>A Record of Travel in the Southwest</h3>
<p>— Wei Ran</p>
<p>(1) From Hong Kong to Haiphong</p>
<p>Since the highways of Guangzhou Bay and Beihai have been destroyed one after another, followed by the Wen-Shan lines, which are sometimes open and sometimes closed and not very smooth, the transportation route to the southwestern provinces is now only one: the route through Haiphong. There are two ways to get to Haiphong from Shanghai. One is to first obtain a transit visa in Shanghai and take the Jardine or Taikoo direct Shanghai-Haiphong steamer. The former takes ten days, and the latter takes half a month. The other is to go to Hong Kong to apply for a visa and then take the Hong Kong-Haiphong steamer. In terms of cost, the former is cheaper, but the opposite is true in terms of time, because it sometimes takes more than a month to apply for a visa in Shanghai, but at most a week in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The procedure for applying for a transit visa in Hong Kong is very simple. Upon arrival, you can immediately go to the visa officer's office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Hong Kong (upstairs in the Banque de l'Indochine) to obtain an application form to fill out. It must be guaranteed by someone with a fixed job in Hong Kong. After paying HK$6 and submitting three photos, you can pick up the visa in two days. However, you must sign for it in person. Then, you can apply for the French consulate's endorsement. According to their regulations, applications are only accepted from 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. If you miss the deadline, you cannot make an exception. Therefore, after obtaining the visa, you must immediately go to the consulate to purchase an endorsement application form (HK$0.10 per form). It must be guaranteed by a store, and then signed and guaranteed by a bank that has business with that store. Only then will the procedure be complete. When submitting the application, attach one photo and an application fee of HK$1.00. If there are no unexpected obstacles, it should take about a week to complete. The shipping companies from Hong Kong to Haiphong are Jardine, Taikoo, and French Post. Each company has a ship sailing every three days. Among them, the Jardine ships have the largest tonnage (over 3,000 tons), and the French Post ships have the smallest tonnage (over 1,000 tons). The facilities are roughly the same. There is a significant difference in time. For example, Taikoo takes more than five days because it also stops at Guangzhou Bay and Beihai. Jardine goes directly and takes 48 hours. The return trip stops at Guangzhou Bay and Beihai and takes three days. French Post goes directly and claims to take 40 hours, but in reality, it also takes two days. However, all ships mainly focus on cargo transport, and the departure dates are not very accurate. Some even delay for three or four days.</p>
<p>(2) The Haiphong Customs</p>
<p>Speaking of the Haiphong customs, travelers passing through Annam consider it to be a very headache. We have heard several terrible rumors in Shanghai and Hong Kong, such as passengers being locked in a dark room for several hours upon arrival, having every piece of luggage turned upside down, and being fined one dollar for a single match. This made us feel extremely uneasy when we stepped onto the Haiphong pier. However, after going through the inspection procedures, we felt that except for the arrogance of those in charge, it was not as bad as the rumors said. However, prior preparation is very important, especially if you do not have acquaintances in Haiphong to meet you. Otherwise, even if you do not suffer the aforementioned bizarre torments, small losses are inevitable. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Promotes Frontier Education: Southwest Education Inspection Team Departs</h3>
<p>(Chongqing, 2nd) In order to actively promote frontier education, the Ministry of Education plans to organize southwest, northwest, Kang-Tibetan, and Xinjiang frontier education inspection teams to go to various frontier provinces for inspection, so as to provide reference for improving frontier education. This year, the Southwest Frontier Education Inspection Team will be organized to inspect the border areas of Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangxi provinces. In addition to education, attention will also be paid to local society and natural science. Taking advantage of the inspection, the team will also promote the War of Resistance and the New Life Movement to the frontier compatriots, in order to awaken them. The team is now organized and held its first team meeting on the 22nd of last month, attended and guided by Gu and Zhang, the two heads of the team. All the team members have gathered in Chongqing yesterday. Minister Chen gave a speech, detailing the importance of the team's mission and the points to be noted during the inspection. The entire team members (divided into three groups: education, society, and nature) took the Jianxia ship to Yibin today, passing through Zhaotong to Kunming, and then went to work in various places in groups. After the work in Yunnan Province is completed, they will then be inspected along the way from Bose in groups, concentrated in Guilin, and transferred to various places in Guizhou for inspection. The estimated inspection period is half a year.</p>
<h3>Chen Dongyuan, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, Discusses How to Choose Departments and Schools (Continued 3)</h3>
<p>Insufficient Recruitment by Schools Does Not Prove Quality: Several Aspects Should Be Noted When Choosing Departments</p>
<p>Standards for Departments: The general principles for choosing departments and schools, which should be discussed and studied, have been mentioned above. These principles are not without value, but none can be used as absolute standards. Everyone's situation is different, and absolute standards cannot be listed. Now, let's first propose several more reliable viewpoints to discuss how to choose departments, and then discuss how to choose schools in the next section. When choosing departments, I think there are several aspects that should be noted for reference:</p>
<p>(1) Personal Talents: The talents endowed by nature are originally different for each person. This is what psychology calls "individual differences." Even if some psychologists do not recognize that people are born with differences, and say that all differences are due to acquired learning, even if it is acquired learning, these differences must be very clear by the age of high school graduation. The most subtle aspect of personality is intelligence. People who are called smart are different: some are full of imagination, some are full of mechanics, some are agile, some are slow, some have sharp intuition, and some believe only after verification. Those with intelligence biased towards imagination are better suited to engage in literature and philosophy; those with intelligence biased towards mechanics are better suited to engage in engineering and machinery; those with quick intelligence are better suited to be politicians and diplomats; those whose intelligence is based on verification and decisive after understanding are better suited to be scientists, historians, doctors, and teachers. The knowledge required for each subject is sometimes interconnected. For example, being a teacher is connected to literature, history, and philosophy; being a doctor is connected to science and engineering; studying business is connected to economics and politics; being a lawyer is connected to the talents required for studying history. However, some subjects cannot be learned without special talent. For example, when learning painting, the ability to distinguish colors must be particularly strong, and one must be able to distinguish subtle color layers; when learning music, the ability to hear sounds must be particularly strong, and one must be able to distinguish extremely subtle sound waves. Although people who study literature do not have to have special talents like painting and music, they must have particularly strong imagination to hope to engage in literary creation. Therefore, students who are good at Chinese writing in middle school cannot be sure that they are suitable for studying literature. Those whose articles are often full of fantasy can study literature; those who focus on reasoning and emphasis on argumentation are suitable to be historians or politicians. In middle school, those who are good at mathematics, physics, and chemistry cannot be sure that they are suitable for entering the science college. Those who are good at mathematics, physics, and chemistry and focus on theory are suitable for entering the science college; those who are good at mathematics, physics, and chemistry and focus on application are suitable for entering the engineering college or medical college.</p>
<h3>Fine Collection of Western Paintings: Exhibition Opened Yesterday, Many Chinese and Western People Visited</h3>
<p>The Fine Collection of Western Paintings Exhibition, prepared by the Shanghai Youth Art Society for four months, opened yesterday (the 3rd) on the fourth floor of the Great New Company on Nanjing Road. It displays 598 fine oil paintings from Western European countries such as Italy, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, France, England, the United States, Imperial Russia, the Soviet Union, and other countries such as Sweden, Norway, Poland, and Hungary. They are systematically arranged and numbered in order, including the masterpieces of major artists from the Renaissance to modern times. The exquisite art is touching and moving, and it is truly rare. In addition, there are more than one hundred famous works collected in Europe by Lin Kanghou, which add even more color. Yesterday, many Chinese and Western people and artists from all over Shanghai went to visit, and all believed that it was an unprecedented event in the country. In order to make it easier for visitors to understand at a glance, the Society specially published a "Catalog" and a "Collection of Famous Paintings in Europe" to compare with the exhibits, complementing each other and leaving nothing unread. It is also heard that the Society welcomes all groups in Shanghai to visit.</p>
<h3>School News</h3>
<p>Private Tongzhou Middle School, No. 850 Xiaoshadu Road: Private Tongzhou Middle School has always been serious in its teaching, so students' achievements are excellent. It is heard that the school has the Gong Furen Scholarship, which selects the best students in each grade and awards them ten yuan each. The winners of this year's high school awards are Chu Jun from Senior Three, Ding Hongxun from Senior Two, Chen Jiajun from Senior One, Yan Jianxin from Junior Three, Li Mengxuan from Junior Two, and Qian Minghui from Junior One. Starting from the next semester, the school will also have a poverty assistance program, divided into three levels: A, B, and C. Level A is fifteen yuan, Level B is ten yuan, and Level C is five yuan. The number of winners can account for 5% of the total number of students. In addition, among the high school graduates of this year, those who have been admitted to universities include Xu Qiancheng, Yuan Huaixi, and Lin, who have been admitted to the China Travel Service; Wu Dijing, who has been admitted to the Agricultural Department of Jinling University; Jiang Shiyao and Yang Yueheng, who have been admitted to the Chemistry Department of Shanghai University; Yuan Yiqin, who has been admitted to the Foreign Language Department of Zhijiang University; and Sun Tairen and Fan Jucheng, who have been admitted to Fudan University. Among the junior high school graduates, those who have been admitted to provincial senior high schools include Yan Jianxin, Yan Fuxin, Ji Yongquan, and others. The remaining students are stepping up preparations to participate in the unified entrance examination for national colleges and universities.</p>
<p>Dajiang Middle School, No. 979 North Chengdu Road, Xinzha Road: Dajiang Middle School, with Principal Zhu Zunwu, is striving for progress. Currently, only the junior high school department is set up. The curriculum is prepared according to the standards promulgated by the Ministry of Education, but in order to adapt to the environment, commercial knowledge, bookkeeping, abacus, and applied writing courses are also added. Classes are held for 35 hours per week. In the second enrollment of this year, more than 160 new students and transfer students were admitted. However, the level of the transfer students is mostly felt to be unsuitable, so there are still vacancies in the first, second, third, and fourth semesters. Enrollment will continue on August 20th, and only tuition and miscellaneous fees of 16 yuan will be charged.</p>

<h3>President Chiang Discusses: China Can Resist Japan Independently, No Need for Foreign Supply in Military and Economic Affairs, Peace Can Only Be Discussed After Japanese Troops Withdraw from China</h3>
<p>Haitong News Agency: General Manager Returns to Shanghai to Report Situation to Chiang</p>
<p>Mr. Mesi, General Manager of Haitong News Agency in the Far East, went to Chongqing and Hong Kong a month ago to inspect the affairs of the agency. He has recently returned to Shanghai. When Mr. Mesi was in Chongqing, he met with General Chiang Kai-shek, President Kong Xiangxi, and other government officials for private talks. On his way back, Mr. Mesi visited Kunming to see the local situation.</p>
<h3>China Can Resist Japan Independently</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Mesi, Chairman Chiang received him individually and held a one-hour talk. Chiang stated to him that China is now almost completely able to resist Japan independently until an indefinite period without relying on foreign supplies in military and economic affairs. At the same time, there will be absolutely no peace before the Japanese troops withdraw from China. Any mediation proposal from a third country that deviates from this basis will be difficult for China to accept.</p>
<h3>Sino-German Relations Are Very Satisfactory</h3>
<p>According to Mr. Mesi, Chiang's demeanor was solemn and his attitude was kind. He was extremely sensitive to the questions raised to him, and he paid attention to events in all aspects and raised some questions himself. Chiang paid close attention to Sino-German relations and believed that they were generally very satisfactory.</p>
<h3>Chinese People Are United</h3>
<p>When Chiang discussed the issue of the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, he firmly declared, "There are no communists in China. The so-called Communist Party now is by no means the Communist Party in Europe. The Chinese people have united to help the whole country resist Japan. As for Sino-Soviet cooperation, it is just a relationship between two friendly countries and does not mean that China is attached to Soviet Russia."</p>
<h3>Economic Self-Sufficiency</h3>
<p>Chiang continued to discuss China's military and economic reserves. He told Mr. Mesi with extraordinary confidence that China has been able to resist Japan independently for an indefinite period without relying on foreign imports in military and economic affairs. In economic terms, China has largely become self-sufficient.</p>
<h3>Sichuan's Territory Is Equal to Germany's</h3>
<p>The separation of Shanghai and Hong Kong is enough to improve China's position. Although China does not have certain items, it knows how to continue to move forward. At the same time, unnecessary items can be exempted from import. Today, the whole country has become an agricultural institution, not afraid of air strikes.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Withdraw from North Jiangxi Road Blockade Gap</h3>
<p>However, Obstacles Are Still Added</p>
<p>Residents' Relocation Has Not Yet Ended</p>
<p>The stores and households and alleys along North Jiangxi Road, from the south end of the Waterworks Bridge to the east end of Old Bazi Road, were suddenly surrounded by Japanese wooden poles and barbed wire fences on the 29th of last month, and the situation suddenly became tense. The surrounded residents also moved to the Central District of the Concession one after another. However, since the previous day,</p>
<p>The number of Japanese soldiers at the blockade gap has been greatly reduced, so the situation is quite relaxed. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Datong News Agency went to patrol again. Except that there was still a Japanese soldier guarding the blockade gap at the Chongming Road intersection, the Japanese soldiers at the two blockade gaps at the Wenjianshi Road intersection and the Haining Road intersection</p>
<p>The sentry post has been withdrawn, and only a few Chinese police officers remain on the outside of the barbed wire. There are more than a dozen Japanese soldiers on the section of North Jiangxi Road from Old Bazi Road to Haining Road, adding barbed wire to the blockade, as if the previous blockades</p>
<p>It is still not thorough enough. The open-air epidemic prevention station on the east side of Haining Road on North Jiangxi Road is still injecting epidemic prevention needles for those who are willing to stay in the area. Judging from the above situation, the Japanese side will obviously take the newly erected barbed wire area as its jurisdiction. However, the situation has become peaceful and appeasing, but the relocation situation has not diminished slightly.</p>
<h3>Guangxi Issues 6% Public Bonds for 8 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Limited to Twelve Years</p>
<p>Business Tax as Foundation</p>
<p>In order to adjust the provincial treasury revenue and expenditure in 1939, the Guangxi Provincial Government issued 8 million yuan of 6% public bonds of Guangxi Province in 1939. The interest rate is set at 6% per annum, with a term of 12 years. From 1940 to April 30, 1951, all amounts will be repaid in full. The business tax revenue of the province is designated as the foundation. The Ministry of Finance, the Auditing Department, the Guangxi Provincial Government, and the Finance Department will each send a representative, and the relevant bank will recommend a representative to form a foundation custody committee. Threat. In addition, the government is now actively developing various provinces. Taking Sichuan Province as an example, its territory is equal to that of Germany, and the possibility of its development is unlimited.</p>
<h3>Peace Can Only Be Discussed After Japanese Troops Withdraw Completely</h3>
<p>Finally, Chiang mentioned the issue of peace and strongly stated that "there is no hope for peace as long as Japanese troops are on Chinese territory. The purpose of China's resistance today is to expel the Japanese army. Before this goal is achieved, the Chinese government will never consider any peace talks. As for mediation, if it is not based on the above-mentioned basis, it will never be accepted by China."</p>
<h3>American Commercial Counselor Arnold Cruises Southwest and Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Discovers That Chongqing Has High Morale</p>
<p>Praises Air-raid Shelters</p>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, Arnold, the American commercial counselor in China, returned to the United States and stayed there for more than a year. He came to China in May and toured the southwest. He stayed in Chongqing for a week and then went to Hong Kong. He returned to Shanghai yesterday (the 1st) afternoon on the Coolidge Presidential Liner.</p>
<h3>Isolationist Trend Has Indeed Disappeared</h3>
<p>According to the talk, American public opinion is now showing a certain form. The American people are now more concerned about the Far East events and understand that the United States' rights in the East must be respected. Although the United States insists on its feeling of "we don't want to fight," the American isolationist trend has indeed disappeared. People in general want to know more about the truth of world events than before.</p>
<h3>Chongqing's Morale Is Highly Commendable</h3>
<p>Mr. Arnold then talked about the Far East, saying that he saw in Sichuan that China had moved its industries in the Yangtze River basin into Sichuan Province. Although there was war, the work of conducting industrial projects was very effective. He was most impressed by this. He discovered that Chongqing's morale was very high and praised the air-raid shelters and fire streets that had been built, saying that Chongqing would build even larger and better air-raid shelters, equipped with air conditioning, beautiful music stages, electric lights, and modern lead pipe equipment, which could be called nightclubs.</p>
<h3>Yunnan-Burma Highway Is Sufficient for Heavy Loads</h3>
<p>When Mr. Arnold stayed in Chongqing, although he did not encounter air raids, he said that the previous Japanese bombing obviously caused very little damage. The residents were quite calm. On the whole, Chongqing City was progressing smoothly. When Mr. Arnold stayed in China's wartime capital, he met with Minister of Communications Zhang Jia'ao. Mr. Arnold said that China's work to facilitate transportation is moving forward with a state of effort to the end. The Yunnan-Burma Highway has proved to be an important "portal." The road is very good and carries at least 100 tons of goods every day. Although it is frustrated by rain, transportation is not hindered.</p>
<h3>Mr. Arnold Awarded Honorary Doctorate</h3>
<p>After Mr. Arnold finished talking with the reporter, he bid farewell to Admiral Yarnell, the outgoing commander of the American Asian Fleet, and his wife, who had just arrived at the customs wharf. According to reports, Mr. Arnold left Shanghai for the United States in February last year for a long vacation. During his stay in the United States, Pomona University in California awarded him an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.</p>
<h3>Qingpu Bus Turns Back</h3>
<p>According to transportation sources, the bus that departed from Shanghai to Qingpu yesterday was blocked and turned back en route. It is said that there were battles in the Shanghai-Qingpu highway area, and the highway was damaged. Now, in order to avoid danger, the Shanghai-Qingpu bus has stopped sailing.</p>
<h3>The Eastern Battlefield: Chinese Troops Begin Movement Under Orders</h3>
<p>Training Completed and Safely Arrived at Destination</p>
<p>Deployment Completed, Battle Imminent</p>
<p>Only Minor Skirmishes in Suburban Shanghai</p>
<p>The Eastern Battlefield Displays a Picture of Maneuver Warfare. Regarding the Chinese troops along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, they have been actively planned by the National Government and rigorously trained in new strategies. Their strength is formidable. Advance units have already crossed the Japanese army's警戒綫 and reached the suburbs of Shanghai. In the Pudong area, guerrilla forces are launching attacks with the assistance of regular troops, also underway. The situation is as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Troops on the Nanjing-Shanghai Line</p>
<p>The Chinese troops responsible for counterattacking Nanjing and Suzhou have been reorganized by the highest military authority of the Eastern Battlefield. They have been given new orders, and the troops originally stationed in counties along the line have been transferred in batches to ×× area to undergo rigorous training in various new tactics. After training, they are sent back to their original posts, and then transferred again for training. Over the past eight months, all county troops have completed their training. On average, each county has trained 4,000 to 5,000 Chinese soldiers. Among them, in addition to the original scattered regular troops, young students, local strong men, and farmers accounted for more than 60%. Now, the Chinese troops in various locations have received orders from the highest authority to begin moving along the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, advancing deep into the Japanese defense zone. According to merchants who have just arrived in Shanghai from Changzhou, Wuxi, and Kunshan, the Chinese troops are well-disciplined, with men under 40 years old. They do not commit any offenses wherever they go, and the local people are overjoyed.</p>
<p>Crossing the警戒綫, Safely Arriving in Suburban Shanghai</p>
<p>The first batch of commando raiders, numbering 2,500, are known as the Jiangnan Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army. Mei Ke-di, Zhu Shou-hua, and Ren Tian-shi serve as commanders, with Deng Ben-yin as the supreme commander. One route follows the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway through Wuxi, Suzhou, and Kunshan, turning onto the highway to Qingpu, heading towards the Shanghai-Qingpu Highway, approaching Hongqiao. Another route goes through Changshu, Taicang, and Jiading, reaching Baoshan, Jiangwan, Dachang, and Luodian. It is now known that these two commando teams have crossed the Japanese army's警戒綫 along the railway and highway, safely arriving at a gathering point in suburban Shanghai ×× area, and have established contact with the Loyal and Patriotic National Salvation Army in Songjiang, Minhang, and Pudong. The other day, they were also spotted near the Japanese Toyota spinning mill on Zhongshan Road in western Shanghai, and then withdrew.</p>
<p>Encounter Battles After Crossing the Highway</p>
<p>When this commando team crossed the Kunshan-Qingpu Highway, they encountered Japanese and puppet troops. Because the team encircled and attacked from multiple routes, launching surprise attacks, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered heavy casualties, and many firearms were seized. Since this battle, the Japanese have been very panicked, making extensive preparations, and firing indiscriminately along the highway, attempting to prevent the Chinese army from advancing. However, the team used diversionary tactics, using sparse gunfire to lure the Japanese army, while launching surprise attacks from multiple routes. The Japanese army was unable to cope. Therefore, the recent炮聲 in suburban Shanghai is true. According to general observations, the prelude to the counteroffensive on the Eastern Battlefield is expected to begin soon.</p>
<p>Pudong Warfare Becomes Active</p>
<p>The Pudong war has fully begun. The troops responsible for attacking the Datuan area are Gu Li-feng's and Yan Zeng's units. According to the planned schedule, they began their attack at midnight on the 26th, preparing for entry into the city at 5:00 AM on the 28th. It is reported that more than 20 Japanese soldiers were killed. A certain officer of Gu's unit also discovered a gasoline ship docked in the river, and quickly used kerosene and firewood to set it on fire. In less than an hour, only the hull remained.</p>
<p>Nanhui's Entire Territory Also Launched</p>
<p>The attacking troops in 新场 are Gu Shou-xin's and Wu Zhen-hai's units. At the designated attack start time, they began their advance. All key points outside the city have now been occupied, and it is reported that Zhang Miao-gen's puppet troops have defected en masse. In the Nanhui area, Xu Cheng-de's and Huang Tie-ying's units, along with other locations, launched attacks simultaneously. Land and water transportation is completely destroyed. The Japanese are defending in the city. Zhoupu is the area of Li Wen-yuan's and Xi Geng-xin's units, which now use small artillery to attack the town every night. The Japanese army is holding firm. According to people from Zhalin, the炮聲 from the Zhalin city bridge was very clear this morning.</p>

<h3>Principal and Interest of the Reconstruction Public Bonds to Be Paid by the End of This Month</h3>
<p>Fully in Accordance with Unified Methods, Shanghai Pays in Six Installments. 金長 Has Also Scheduled a Lottery for Principal Repayment</p>

<h3>Rice Market in Chaos Again Yesterday; Rice Merchants Attempt to Raise Prices</h3>
<p>70-80% Involved in Under-the-Table Transactions. However, Rice and Flour Reserves Are Very Sufficient</p>
<p>Yesterday's publicly traded price of rice reached the maximum price limit. At the same time, under-the-table trading among brokers was extremely rampant, with the highest price reaching around 22.50 yuan. It is estimated that among the city's 105 rice shops (excluding the few management committee members who are in charge of fair transactions and have the mission of enforcing price limits and stopped buying and selling), those involved in under-the-table transactions accounted for almost 70-80%. According to a reporter from Daguan News Agency who went to the market for investigation yesterday morning, the black market price rose sharply again by 60-70 cents. Moreover, although囤戶 saw the price increase, they were still hoarding their inventory, hoping for further gains, and were unwilling to sell. The chaotic state of the market has returned to the situation of the middle of last month.</p>
<p>Visiting the Authorities</p>
<p>Various rice-related organizations in this city will again dispatch representatives within days to report the situation of the Shanghai rice market to the工部局 of the Public and Shared Concession, and to discuss food regulation measures to maintain the food supply within the concession. It is reported that the authorities have conducted a detailed investigation of the food supply in Shanghai. In addition to the approximately 400,000 bags of rice stored in various warehouses and firms, there are also millions of bags of flour stored, so the Shanghai food supply is adequately prepared and there is no fear of shortage. However, it is hoped that rice merchants will find ways to疏運 sources of supply from the production areas to facilitate regulation.</p>
<p>Announcing Rice Reserves</p>
<p>The survey report on rice reserves in various warehouses, conducted by the Bean and Rice Trade Association, has been completed and will be released at 4:00 PM today. As for the two concession authorities' thorough investigation of rice reserves in various warehouses, it will also be announced. Whether the quantity is相差 with the Bean and Rice Industry's investigation remains to be seen after the announcement. If there are overflowing rice reserves that have not been included in the report, then the concealment will be居奇, and the authorities will take decisive action.</p>
<p>Rice Merchants' Attempts</p>
<p>Yesterday's market transactions, except for Baiyuan Dongshuang rice and other rice without price limits, which still had a few transactions, japonica rice transactions were almost non-existent. It is reported that they were all done privately outside the market, at a price漲 of three to five-six兀 higher than the限价. According to a reporter from Xinxin News Agency, the rise in rice prices is entirely due to speculative manipulation. A part of the rice merchants are angry but dare not speak out about the工部局's enforcement of price limits, and driven by profit, they privately engage in transactions, attempting to raise rice prices in order to achieve profit-making goals.</p>
<p>Association Notice</p>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Number Industry Association reiterates to all fellow colleagues: Respectfully, the price of rice in this city is rising endlessly. The best决白粳 in the market has exceeded the price limit, black market is rampant, and it is impossible to stop. According to reports from members, goods with price limits of 20 yuan and 16 yuan are impossible to purchase in the market. If you want to buy goods exceeding the price limit, it is illegal. If you don't buy, there is no goods in the market. The inventory in the store is limited and will soon be sold out, and they are requesting a proper solution. The current chaotic situation in the market is intensifying, and black market越价 has become an open secret, impossible to curb. If our colleagues are购进 over the limit, but the stores must comply with the price limit, then购进 over the limit is not only a sacrifice, but also an illegal act, and the situation is extremely difficult. Therefore, we reiterate to all fellow colleagues, do not buy rice and grain over the limit in the market. Sales must strictly abide by the price limit and must not exceed it in any way. This matter concerns the entire city's food supply, and the 租界常局 will have appropriate measures to deal with it. Our colleagues must remain calm and await a solution. This is our sincere prayer.</p>
<h3>Throwing Candy and Cakes, Requesting Donations for Relief, Situation Is Somewhat Suspicious</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the western part of this city in Shanghai, there were people who looked like workers, throwing a food bag into each household, containing candies, cakes, and other items, and attaching a printed letter stating that they were requesting two or three角 in donations to relieve the unemployed. After residents received these items, some inquired about the true motive of the letter throwers, but they were unable to answer and left without a word. It seemed that the workers throwing the letters were not aware of the reason for this action either.</p>
<h3>Coastal Shipping Seized; Nanyang Routes Expanded</h3>
<p>Foreign Vessels Mostly Diverted to Siam Ports; Shipping Booming in Singapore and 小吕宋</p>
<p>The Nanhua shipping routes' ports are located in the coastal provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong. Since the fall of Shantou, shipping has been greatly affected. Currently, in Guangdong Province, only Guangzhou Bay, Beihai, and Haikou are通, but transportation to the interior is extremely inconvenient. In Fujian Province, only Xiamen is accessible, and it is isolated from the interior. Although foreign vessels intend to test航 to Xinghua and Quanzhou, it is feared that they will not succeed. For example, on the 1st of last month, a certain British vessel loaded with goods from Shanghai to Xingquan, and to this day, more than a month later, there is still no news of its return to Shanghai. Whether the vessel's passengers and goods have been吾起卸 is currently unknown. Therefore, the issue of航 to Xingquan is difficult to achieve in the near future. The report in yesterday's newspaper that Taikoo's Jiangsu轮 was going to Xinghua and Quanzhou was a misreport. The seaports in Zhejiang Province are currently only Ningbo and 处. The vessels operating there are doing average business. Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Haifu轮 is also planning to join the航, and is currently applying to the authorities.</p>
<p>Taikoo轮 Diverted to Shanghai-Siam Route</p>
<p>After the Nanhua shipping routes were affected by this, shipping companies suffered heavy losses. Therefore, the central商 Taikoo Company immediately sought alternative plans. In addition to increasing航 to Guangzhou Bay and Haiphong, it has recently opened the Shanghai-Siam route. In the past, the Suzhou and Zhangjiakou vessels had gone to Siam. Now there is a third vessel, the Guiyang号, scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Siam this Sunday (the 6th), via Shantou, Hong Kong, and Tule, Saigon, and then to Bangkok. The company also newly opened the Singapore route at the end of last month. The Qingyuan轮 departed from Shanghai on the 28th of last month, also湾航 to Hong Kong and Guangzhou Bay. The second轮 going to Singapore has also been assigned, the Xinjiang轮, scheduled to depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong and directly to Singapore next Monday (the 8th).</p>
<p>Jardine and Other轮 Change航 Plans</p>
<p>Generally, foreign shipping vessels, after encountering threats along the coast of China, had to seek new outlets and develop towards Nanyang. The British firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. is also in計割中. The British vessel Hague号, managed by Qia Cheng Shen行 on Avenue Edward VII, was originally scheduled to sail to Hong Kong yesterday, but due to the desire to develop towards Nanyang, it was changed to depart from Shanghai for Hong Kong on the 6th, directly放航 to Singapore, Penang, and Rangoon. The Norwegian vessel Landi号, managed by Tongyi Shipping Company on the Bund, is scheduled to放航 directly to Hong Kong on the 6th. Youlita号 is scheduled to go to Singapore and Penang via Hong Kong on the 8th. The Peter Paul号 of the American Fulaizi Company, managed by Hongyun Shipping Bureau, is scheduled to sail to Hong Kong and 小吕宋 on the 6th.</p>
<p>Bleak Scene on the Beiyang Shipping Routes</p>
<p>Various foreign shipping companies are developing new航錢 to Nanyang one after another. As for the Beiyang shipping routes, they have all been seized by Japanese vessels. Recently, due to the change in water fees to港币, foreign vessel freight has been extremely weak. According to the shipping industry, this scene is unprecedented since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Resumption of航 to Wenzhou Reportedly Approved</p>
<p>Regarding the resumption of航 to Wenzhou, the current Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander has approved it. However, Japanese warships are attempting to blockade and prevent the resumption of航, and have laid mines outside the瓯江 to blockade it. Now, the British company Yilong's Shenguang轮 attempted to航 to Wenzhou, but was prevented from entering by a Japanese warship outside Wenzhou. Thus, it was forced to return to Shanghai and is scheduled to arrive back in Shanghai today. Rumors that it did not receive the approval of the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander are inaccurate. The failure of this决 to resume航 to Wenzhou is entirely due to the obstruction of Japanese warships.</p>
<h3>Ministry Orders Strict Suppression of Private Money Remittances by All Customs Offices</h3>
<p>Military Personnel and Civil Servants Should All Be Subject to Customs Inspection. The Ministry of Finance recently telegraphed all customs offices, saying: Regarding the tasks of customs offices to investigate and suppress the private remittance of gold, silver, and banknotes, and to inspect travelers carrying banknotes exceeding the limit, orders have been issued to all customs offices to handle them seriously. Now, it is further stipulated that all passengers passing through customs, regardless of military personnel, civil servants, or merchants, should be subject to customs inspection to emphasize功令 and prevent abuses. In addition to asking Chairman Chiang of the Military Affairs Commission and the Executive Yuan to order all troops, officers, and soldiers, military motorcade teams, and all机关所属 personnel to comply, and电 to all customs offices, you should be informed and earnestly implement inspections.</p>
<h3>Goods Withdrawn from Customs Warehouses in June</h3>
<p>According to Customs Releases, Totaling Over 3 Million金</p>

<h3>Rumor: Ministry of Finance to Implement Domestic Exchange Control</h3>
<p>Limit Purchases to Daily Necessities to Prevent Legal Tender Outflow; Coastal Areas Will Implement, Shanghai More Cautious</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that the Ministry of Finance has ordered the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture to jointly form a domestic exchange management committee, intending to prevent the outflow of legal tender from the interior and to统制 domestic exchange business, limiting it to the purchase of daily necessities. Shanghai will be particularly careful. Those who wish to remit money to coastal cities must apply to the committee in advance and must have proof from the merchant. It is said that this can be implemented next week. A reporter from Daguan News Agency inquired about the details of this matter from the four banks of China, Central, Communications, and Agriculture yesterday. According to the spokespersons of each bank, the matter is purely the responsibility of the Chongqing head office, and the Shanghai branch has not heard anything about it so far. It is currently difficult to predict whether Shanghai branches will be ordered to handle this matter in the future. It was further learned from the financial sector that the central government's move to统制 domestic exchange should have been implemented after the Shanghai war, and the decision to implement it now is a very urgent need. The Chongqing head office in Sichuan is the most suitable 機關 for this matter. The Hong Kong branches have the most burdensome work. The Shanghai branch may not handle this matter at that time. However, the Shanghai area is by no means放纵 and unregulated. According to their expectation, the Shanghai office of the City Chamber of Commerce will be entrusted to take charge in the future. The各业公会 will issue certificates based on the applications of each manufacturer, and then purchase goods from coastal cities, on the one hand, to implement the central government's orders, and on the other hand, to prevent奸人 from taking legal tender outflow. As for the Chamber of Commerce's previous handling of applications from各业 for the purchase of foreign exchange from the four banks, work will continue as usual.</p>

<h3>工部局警備委員會討論管理交通問題 (Continuation from Yesterday)</h3>
<p>Suggestions to Discontinue Tram Service</p>
<p>The China Automobile Association continued to state that tramcars are already considered outdated. If they can be discontinued, tram stops can be removed, and the crowds on the streets can be dispersed. The danger in traffic can also be reduced. However, discontinuing tram service is difficult to achieve in the short term. Therefore, the plan to gradually replace tramcars with trolleybuses should be implemented as soon as possible. Last year, when the tram company considered reconstructing the tram tracks on the Bund and Nanjing Road, some people suggested replacing tramcars with trolleybuses. However, the company strongly opposed this plan. The reason it gave was that the residents of this port are crowded, and considering the living standards of half of them, tramcars are the most economical means of transportation. Moreover, each tramcar and trailer can carry 120 passengers and only requires one driver, making it unparalleled in economy. The conclusion reached by the Public Works Department Board of Directors at that time was that the bureau had no right to force the addition of trolleybuses until it acquired the tram company in 1940 according to the provisions of the tram operating franchise contract. The issue of acquisition was still too early to discuss. Therefore, it was decided that there was no need to discuss it. The Security Committee believes that there is still no room for discussion regarding the suggestion made by the China Automobile Association this time.</p>
<p>Adding Traffic Police Officers Postponed</p>
<p>The association also suggested that the authorities of the concession should add traffic police officers on motorcycles to intercept drivers who violate traffic regulations. The driver's license would be confiscated, and a fine would be paid to the police station for redemption afterward. However, the simple procedure of the police station collecting fines from drivers has not yet been implemented. The association is willing to assist the police station in implementing the proposed plan to the best of its ability. The association believes that traffic police officers should currently have the authority to order people who violate traffic regulations to stop on the side of the road and inform them of their mistakes. This method can be applied to old vehicles and drivers who deliberately drive slowly. The police department reported that the current police officers have heavy responsibilities. It will only be possible to add traffic police officers on bicycles when the environment permits. As for ordering drivers who violate regulations to hand over their permits, it has already been implemented. The police station already has the authority to order those who violate traffic regulations to stop. Slow-moving drivers are also dealt with at any time.</p>
<p>No Need to Establish a Special Traffic Department</p>
<p>The association also put forward a suggestion, saying that the authorities of the two concessions should jointly establish a special traffic department, with well-known car drivers, including members of the association, participating in it. These drivers would wear badges and carry printed forms to report any driver's carelessness or dangerous situations. Their reports should have the same authority as reports submitted by ordinary police officers and should be accepted by the police department. The police department believes that this suggestion is not advisable. The proposed organization of a special traffic department is not necessary. Any citizen can report violations of traffic regulations to the police station. If the report is accompanied by detailed records, the police station will pay attention to it and take necessary measures. The Security Committee also believes that the above suggestion is practically obstructive and there is no need to adopt it.</p>
<p>Problems with Parking of Heavy Trucks</p>
<p>The association also stated that trucks carrying heavy goods, such as timber and steel bars, often park on the sides of major roads during rush hours, such as trucks parked on Hankou Road unloading newspaper rolls for newspaper offices. The police station should pay attention to this. The police department reported that heavy goods are not allowed to be loaded or unloaded during rush hours. The license issued by the Public Works Department already contains explicit provisions. In the future, the police station will pay attention to the loading and unloading of other goods and the paper trucks mentioned by the association. The members of the Security Committee unanimously agreed that there is no need to take other measures.</p>
<p>Traffic Lights Are Properly Installed</p>
<p>Westerner Mr. Liddell said that the Public Works Department has disregarded the 29th suggestion put forward by the Traffic Committee between 1924 and 1946. The suggestion stated, "The Public Works Department should conduct extensive trials of various traffic control signals until the most suitable tool is found. Then all such tools should become standard for uniformity. The traffic control signals used in the Public Concession and the French Concession should be the same, if possible." The position, color, intensity, and height of all current traffic lights vary, and they are close to neon lights, making it difficult to drive vehicles. Regarding this, the police department stated that the standardization of traffic control lights is progressing slowly, but it is indeed close to the general standards adopted by the United Kingdom and the United States. What needs to be explained is that when deciding on the location of the traffic lights, it is not always possible to strictly adhere to a certain standard. The situation at each road intersection must be studied individually, and the current and future decorations should be taken into account. As for neon lights, if their installation location is less than 100 feet away from the traffic lights, they must apply to this office for review. This office will inspect the proposed installation location before the Public Works Department approves the installation. The police department continued that this office has contacted the Shanghai Electric Power Company and asked it to achieve the goal of standardization to the extent that it can be implemented, and asked it to estimate the cost of the renovation project. At that time, an opinion was raised that drivers have no major difficulty in paying attention to red and green lights. Based on the above reasons, the members of the Security Committee all believe that there is no need to take any other measures.</p>
<p>Short Posts on Platforms Are Not Dangerous</p>
<p>Mr. Liddell continued to express dissatisfaction with the short posts on both sides of the platform in the center of the road, saying that the Public Works Department's installation of various short posts is contrary to the 21st suggestion of the previous Traffic Committee, and claimed that many of these short posts are unreasonable or even dangerous. The ones erected at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Seymour Road were specifically pointed out by Mr. Liddell as having the above-mentioned shortcomings. The police department said that the Traffic Committee's suggestion only refers to the confusion between the electric poles in the middle of the road and the short posts on both sides of the pedestrian platform in the center of the road intersection. The 23rd suggestion of the previous Traffic Committee stated that on roads with sufficient width, platforms should be provided for pedestrians and installed at their important intersections. All current platforms are set up to implement this suggestion. The short posts referred to by Mr. Liddell are a necessary part of the platform, and Mr. Liddell emphasized the danger of these short posts, but none of the recent accidents caused by collisions with fixed objects are enough to prove his claims. The Security Committee expressed its agreement with the above.</p>
<p>All the above-mentioned opinions of the Security Committee have been approved by the Public Works Department Board of Directors at its regular meeting on the 26th. (End of the Second Section) (End)</p>
<h3>日人擬籌辦空防獎劵</h3>
<h3>Japanese Plan to Launch Air Defense Lottery</h3>
<p>The English-language *Shanghai Times* reports, according to a Japanese newspaper, that several private Japanese investors, imitating the Chinese government's approach, may soon launch a "Chinese Air Defense Lottery" with 300 million tickets at one yuan each. Each drawing would offer prizes of up to one million yuan. The profits would be used to promote commercial aviation in China and to cover a portion of the military expenses of the Japanese Army and Navy Air Corps in China. Four of the six Japanese who initiated this plan are retired military officers, currently in discussions with the Asian Institute and other Japanese authorities. A similar plan to establish the Japanese Air Force with funds raised from lottery sales in Japan was opposed and canceled by the Japanese government on the grounds that such an enterprise would promote gambling.</p>
<h3>日人不滿意『小蝴蝶』</h3>
<h3>Japanese Dissatisfied with "Little Butterfly"</h3>
<p>The *Continental Daily* reports that the Japanese Consulate Police Department protested to the Public Works Department yesterday (the 1st) through Akagi, the Assistant Chief Inspector of the Police Department, requesting a ban on the color cartoon "The Little Poor Butterfly" currently being shown at the Grand Theatre. The Japanese Consulate Police believe that the film harms Japan's national prestige. The film is produced by Columbia Pictures and has been shown three times a day since July 27. Newsreels, cartoons, and other supplementary films are apparently not included in the Public Works Department's inspection of feature films.</p>
<h3>江湖術士妖言歛錢被逮「徐州知府」之子惑於三十萬財運方子英遇騙發覺</h3>
<h3>Itinerant Taoist Priests Arrested for Extorting Money with Demonic Talk: Son of "Prefect of Xuzhou" Duped by 300,000 Fortune, Fang Ziying Discovers Fraud</h3>
<p>Fang Ziying, a native of Ningbo (age 24), residing at 690 Sixth Lane, Rue Adoard, was passing by the entrance of the Dingsheng Hotel at No. 4, Lane 141, Fujian Road, on the morning of the 17th of last month when he was suddenly spotted by Lin Ziqi, a face reader from Zhenjiang who had a sign hanging in Room 19 of the hotel. Lin immediately stopped Fang and said, "Observing your yintang, it is clear that you will have great wealth." He insisted on inviting Fang to his room to discuss how Fang's fate was prosperous and that he would soon obtain great wealth, and arranged for Fang to come again in three days, promising to determine how to obtain the wealth. Fang was misled by his words and not only paid a face-reading fee of eight jiao, but also went again as agreed on the 20th. Lin suddenly claimed that his skills were shallow and introduced Xu Yeping, a native of Ningbo, to give Fang another reading. Xu performed a ritual, seeking divine guidance and burning talismans. Then, he produced a yellow paper and briefly circled it over incense. Zhusha characters appeared on the paper, stating that Fang was originally the son of the Prefect of Xuzhou who killed a civilian woman because he wanted to rape her but failed. Therefore, he currently had a fortune of 300,000 yuan, but it was blocked by vengeful spirits. He must resolve this grievance before the fortune could be obtained. Xu then instructed Fang to pay a fee of 30 yuan to resolve the grievance in three days. Fang had already fallen for their deception, so he delivered 30 yuan as instructed. Then, Xu Yeping said that the fortune of 300,000 yuan could indeed be obtained, but a daughter was needed to replace a son, and he must first seek the soul-summoning technique of the God of Wealth to summon the arrival of the fortune. However, 100 yuan must be paid for summoning the soul, and the money must be delivered on the 29th. At this time, Fang's mind was bewildered by the great fortune of 300,000 yuan, and seeing the characters actually appearing on the white paper, he believed it without doubt. On the 29th, he managed to raise 100 yuan and sent it. Xu further ordered Fang to pay another 80 yuan on the 31st, and the fortune would arrive immediately. Fang obeyed and paid the money. Unexpectedly, Xu claimed that the fortune had reached Xuzhou and would arrive in Shanghai soon, but a daughter was needed to replace a son. He needed to bring 600 yuan in legal tender tomorrow and offer it before the god, and the great fortune of 300,000 yuan would enter his hands, and the 600 yuan could also be returned at the same time. However, Fang did not have this large sum of money, so he borrowed it from his brother, Fang Ziheng. After Fang Ziheng inquired about the details and conducted an investigation, he learned that Lin Ziqi and Xu Yeping were all itinerant Taoist priests who specialized in using their eloquent tongues and flowery words to deceive women, children, and ignorant youths out of their money. The characters appearing on the white paper were merely a very common illusion. All that was needed was to write the characters on the paper with alum water, and the characters would appear after the paper was exposed to hot steam. Therefore, he wrapped a towel to make it look like 600 yuan in banknotes and ordered Fang Ziying to take it there. When Lin, Xu, and their accomplice Fan Yiming saw Fang coming, they pretended to seek divine guidance, worship Buddha, and burn talismans, intending to take advantage of the opportunity to replace Fang's bundle of paper. Unexpectedly, Fang Ziheng had already reported it to the Laozha Police Station. Chief Detective Zhu Shouling and detective Zhi Hong rushed to the scene and arrested Lin, Xu, and Fan. They were sent to the Special First Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Zhu explained the process and filed a lawsuit according to Article 339 of the Criminal Law, requesting that they be severely punished as a warning to those who use demonic talk to deceive the public and extort money. Judge Sun Jiajie interrogated and confirmed the facts, and then sentenced Lin, Xu, and Fan to six months of penal servitude for jointly obtaining money through fraud, as a warning.</p>

<h3>人生幸福和品格全繫於　生殖腺內分泌的豐足</h3>
<h3>Life's Happiness and Character Depend Entirely on the Abundance of Sex Gland Endocrine Secretions</h3>
<p>In the days before medicine was advanced, the creation of life's happiness and character was always attributed to the "eight characters" in destiny. From the moment a baby was born from the mother's womb, their lifetime of joy, suffering, intelligence, and foolishness was determined by the hour of their birth. Isn't this a completely absurd mistake? Because today, with the rapid development of physiology and the advancement of medicine, we deeply understand that the strength or weakness of the endocrine secretions in the body's sex glands manipulates our future and character. The endocrine secretions of the sex glands are truly the source of our lives. In underage men and women, the stimulation and regulation of these glands promote the development of height, weight, and chest circumference. After adulthood, in addition to a portion stored in the seminal vesicles, specifically for reproductive purposes to meet the needs of love, the rest is still irrigated throughout the body by blood circulation, with various functions such as regulating metabolism, nourishing nerves, promoting development, and regulating emotions and rationality. Therefore, a young man who keeps himself clean, preserves his virginity, and keeps his sex gland fluids abundant will surely have a handsome appearance, rich thoughts, quick actions, excellent character, and can surpass others in studying and learning, and his future will be immeasurable. Once he marries a healthy, beautiful, and affectionate woman, their love will inevitably be deep and lasting, and they will have sons and daughters, and the family will be happy. What a happy life! However, there are also some bad youths who commit self-ejaculation in the early stages of spring, or early marriage indulgence, and unrestrained debauchery. How can the truly valuable sex gland fluids not be exhausted if they are wasted like this? All kinds of symptoms, such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, thin semen, infertility, and neurasthenia, are endless. Such youths, even if they have become adults, are as childish as children all over, or they are already showing signs of aging even though their age has not increased. They will abandon their studies and learning halfway. In marital life, they will inevitably be dissatisfied with their wives. Imagine the wife's enthusiasm, but no one to consume it, how can it not make her resentful and angry, and the family will also have many problems? Therefore, they are passive, lazy, and have a poor character and reputation, and their future happiness is lost! According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the only remedy is to take the sex gland hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su," which is the most effective treatment for these symptoms. This agent is specifically for treating the above-mentioned symptoms, and its high quality and great efficacy are unmatched by other similar preparations. Therefore, after taking it, it can produce semen, nourish the kidneys, nourish the nerves, promote development, and regulate metabolism. Continuing to take it for half a month can fundamentally cure the above-mentioned symptoms. Regular use in all seasons can also have the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenating the body. However, those with spermatorrhea must also take "Himitotsu's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to strengthen the seminal valve and stop leakage, so that both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, and the results will be faster!</p>
<h3>遺精惡化後的可怕</h3>
<h3>The Horrors After Spermatorrhea Worsens</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>—Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>遺精症雖然可怕，但尚是前期症，若由遺精而釀成了滑精漏精症，那才真正的危險之至！遺精症的來源，據醫學上的論斷，大都因自瀆縱欲民，氫性神經斷傷了，於是精關的管束即不能嚴密。在夜間酣眠神經呈休息態時，偶有美夢繚繞，性神經稍受刺激，精液即遺洩而出，雖或由夢中驚醒，但已無及！此時若服特效藥「希米脫氏固精片」以增強精關之機能，則遺精即可痊愈，所最可惜者，多數人每以為遺精並不是病，旣不痛，又不癢關什麼緊呢？要知不痛不癢的毛病，是最厲害的毛病、遺精若遲延失治，因為精液繼績的遺失，性神經必日益衰弱，精關必日益鬆弛。因此在夜間即無夢境的刺激，精液每順流而出。一覺醒來，褲已污濕，這是多麼的惱恨呢！遺精進至此階段，即成滑精症。若再因循失治，那雖在白日因用腦力過度，或偶見女色，或在大小便時，均可使此物勃起，而有精液洩出，這就是最可怕的漏精症。我們的血肉之軀，體內的精液是有限的。今遺洩滑漏不止，怎能不枯竭？則凡腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，早洩陽萎，發育不全，精薄不育等症更相繼併發。是以志氣消沉，精神萎靡，怕寒畏熱，萬事消極，在學校的學生，因不能專心一志，大有留級退學的危險！在商店工廠習業的青年，因不能集精會神，亦有不能勝任之虞！在男女之間，因體貌不揚，未婚者有陷於失戀的悲慘，已婚者於夫婦生活上亦必不能美滿，為妻憎恨，家庭每演出種種悲劇！</p>
<p>Spermatorrhea is frightening, but it is only a preliminary symptom. If spermatorrhea leads to spermatorrhea and leakage, that is truly extremely dangerous! According to medical judgment, the source of spermatorrhea is mostly due to masturbation and indulgence, which damages the nervous system. Then, the control of the sperm valve cannot be strict. When the nerves are resting at night, and there are occasional beautiful dreams, the sexual nerves are slightly stimulated, and the semen is discharged. Even if you wake up in shock from a dream, it is too late! At this time, taking the special medicine "Himitotsu's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to enhance the function of the sperm valve can cure spermatorrhea. What is most regrettable is that most people think that spermatorrhea is not a disease. It doesn't hurt or itch, so what's the big deal? You should know that painless and itchless problems are the most severe problems. If spermatorrhea is delayed and not treated, the sexual nerves will inevitably weaken, and the sperm valve will inevitably relax due to the continuous loss of semen. Therefore, even without the stimulation of dreams at night, semen flows out smoothly. When you wake up, your pants are wet, how annoying is that! Spermatorrhea advances to this stage and becomes spermatorrhea. If you continue to delay treatment, even during the day, excessive use of brain power, or occasionally seeing women, or during urination and defecation, can cause the penis to erect and semen to be discharged. This is the most terrifying leakage. In our flesh and blood body, the semen in the body is limited. Now that the leakage is endless, how can it not be exhausted? Then, symptoms such as brain failure and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, premature ejaculation and impotence, incomplete development, and infertility will occur one after another. Therefore, ambition is depressed, the spirit is sluggish, you fear the cold and heat, and everything is negative. Students at school are in danger of failing and dropping out because they cannot concentrate! Young people who study in shops and factories may not be able to cope because they cannot concentrate! Between men and women, due to unattractive appearance, unmarried people may fall into the tragedy of being dumped, and married people will inevitably not be happy in their married life, and will be hated by their wives, and families will often stage various tragedies!</p>
<p>所以遺精症必須及早作澈底治療.治法.據世界名醫及余經驗均以服「希米脫氏固精片」，則即可聓固精關，鎮靜神經，使夜得安眠，夢幻減少，遺精旣可於當夜立止。復振足了精神。如因遺精失治已有滑精漏精，或早婚縱欲使生殖腺液枯竭而有上述諸症者，則須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」以培補腦腎，增益精血，滋養神經，若繼績服用半月以後，更可助長發育，調整新陳代謝，上述各症即可根本治愈。中老年人常服更可收延年益壽返老還童之效。</p>
<p>Therefore, spermatorrhea must be thoroughly treated as early as possible. The treatment method, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, is to take "Himitotsu's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets," which can consolidate the sperm valve, calm the nerves, make you sleep peacefully at night, reduce fantasies, and stop spermatorrhea that night. It also revitalizes the spirit. If spermatorrhea has been left untreated and has led to spermatorrhea and leakage, or early marriage indulgence has exhausted the sex gland fluids and caused the above-mentioned symptoms, then you must also take the sex gland hormone preparation "Shengzhi Su" to nourish the brain and kidneys, increase sperm and blood, and nourish the nerves. If you continue to take it for half a month, it can also promote development and regulate metabolism, and the above-mentioned symptoms can be fundamentally cured. Regular use by middle-aged and elderly people can also have the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenating the body.</p>
<p>遺精患者楊長青君，江寧人，年二十六歲，兼有腦弱腎虧，余即囑服上述良藥，並施以電療注射，經一月的悉心治療，果回復了他美滿健康，日昨來函，盛謝再造之恩！</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Changqing, a spermatorrhea patient from Jiangning, is 26 years old and also has brain weakness and kidney deficiency. I immediately ordered him to take the above-mentioned good medicine and gave him electrotherapy injections. After a month of careful treatment, he indeed recovered his perfect health. He sent a letter yesterday, expressing his gratitude for the kindness of rebirth!</p>

<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>—American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>昨在邵君的一個宴會席上，聽到某百貨公司經理張君的一席談話，覺得很有意義，特為記之如左，他說：『獨脫姚：我自從在申報上看到人們健康知識所論的乳峯發育以後，除對你們做醫生的苦心孤詣，造福人羣，表示無限欽敬之外，而同時覺得女子乳峯，萎滬與高聳，其間的確大有關係，我對於醫道雖是門外漢，不懂什麼生殖腺，卵巢機能等等名詞。但在女性的姿態上看來，好像看到乳峯高聳的女性，不管她的面貌怎麼樣，總覺有一種說不出來的好感。反之，如乳峯萎滬，臀部瘦削的女子，那麼她的衣飾無論怎樣生得美麗，不知怎的，見了就會發生一種憎惡……』語至此，有一位會計師×君，就向著張君笑問道，『你這樣愛好健美，然則尊夫人的胸前雙峯，是否能夠合乎你的理想？』張君卽正色道：『說句忠實話，幸得戝內的乳峯發育尚佳，否則雖不至於壞了良心道德遺棄她，但難免不要在外面偷偷摸摸了！』</p>
<p>Yesterday at a banquet hosted by Mr. Shao, I heard a speech by Mr. Zhang, the manager of a department store, which I found very meaningful, so I recorded it as follows. He said: "Dr. Yao, since I saw the discussions on breast development in the *Shen Bao*'s Health Knowledge section, in addition to expressing my infinite admiration for your painstaking efforts as doctors to benefit the public, I also feel that there is indeed a great relationship between a woman's breasts, whether they are undeveloped or well-developed. Although I am a layman in medicine and do not understand terms such as sex glands and ovarian function, but looking at a woman's posture, it seems that when I see a woman with well-developed breasts, no matter what her face looks like, I always feel an indescribable sense of goodwill. On the other hand, if a woman has undeveloped breasts and thin hips, no matter how beautiful her clothes are, I don't know why, but seeing her will give rise to a kind of aversion..." At this point, an accountant, Mr. X, smiled and asked Mr. Zhang, "You are so fond of physical beauty, so are your wife's breasts able to meet your ideals?" Mr. Zhang immediately said seriously, "To tell you the truth, fortunately, my wife's breasts are well-developed, otherwise, although I would not be so unconscionable as to abandon her, I would inevitably have to sneak around outside!"</p>
<p>觀乎上述，足見乳峯對女性的幸福，所關至大。如不幸萎滬，應速求科學的彌補，據世界婦科名醫康德林及余經驗。均一致以服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』最為對症而特效，蓋此劑係由壯健動物之卵巢分泌及礦植物之補腦血成分，經科學方法配製而成。故功效偉大，藥性和平，不分寒暑，均可常服，若連服二月，不特可以萎滬的乳峯隆然高聳，同時且能調整月經，消滅子宮障碍，促進妊娠機能，紅潤面頰，長駐青春。</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that breasts are of utmost importance to a woman's happiness. If they are unfortunately undeveloped, you should seek scientific compensation as soon as possible. According to world-renowned gynecologist Dr. Condolin and my experience, it is unanimously agreed that taking the ovarian preparation "Shengzhi Su" for women is the most effective treatment for the symptoms. This agent is made by scientific methods from the ovarian secretions of strong animals and the brain-nourishing and blood-replenishing components of minerals and plants. Therefore, it has great efficacy, peaceful medicinal properties, and can be taken regularly regardless of the season. If you take it continuously for two months, not only can undeveloped breasts become well-developed, but it can also regulate menstruation, eliminate uterine disorders, promote pregnancy function, make your cheeks rosy, and maintain youth.</p>

<h3>尿中忽然出血的淋病</h3>
<h3>Gonorrhea with Sudden Bleeding in the Urine</h3>
<p>在吾輩醫家日常時所遭遇之淋病症象中，有不少的病人，忽因尿中出血而莫名其驚恐。實則正亦不必作此大驚小怪，淋病而尿中出血，是淋毒性膀胱炎一症，恒所遇之也。而膀胱炎一症之成因，十之七八，由於行局部器械手術之結果，因爲不純練之手術，在行術時，淋菌往往自後尿道達於膀胱，因而侵蝕膀胱粘膜，遂發膀胱炎。此時之小便，全部溷濁，甚至有血尿流出，最重者爲膀胱內出血淸。又因血管破裂口大時，則其所出之血淸，瀦留膀胱，而使尿液全作赤色。幸此種現象亦不恒見。而以一般而倫，不過多在排尿時，因膀胱壁肌肉收縮的關係，而有少量之出血。至於膀胱中的出血情形，則多在尿後，以其淋菌多先侵犯膀胱頸部故也。此症之特徵爲下腹部，恥骨縫際感到刺痛，此刺痛在排尿時放散於陰莖之先端也。</p>
<p>Among the gonorrhea symptoms that we doctors encounter daily, many patients are inexplicably frightened by sudden bleeding in the urine. In fact, there is no need to make such a fuss. Gonorrhea with bleeding in the urine is a symptom of gonorrheal cystitis, which is often encountered. The cause of cystitis is, in seven or eight out of ten cases, the result of local instrument surgery. Because the surgery is not purely practiced, during the operation, gonococci often reach the bladder from the posterior urethra, thus eroding the bladder mucosa and causing cystitis. At this time, the urine is completely cloudy, and even bloody urine flows out. The most severe case is bleeding in the bladder. Also, when the rupture of the blood vessel is large, the serum that comes out of it accumulates in the bladder, causing the urine to turn completely red. Fortunately, this phenomenon is not always seen. In general, however, there is often a small amount of bleeding during urination due to the contraction of the muscles of the bladder wall. As for the bleeding in the bladder, it often occurs after urination, because gonococci often invade the bladder neck first. The characteristic of this symptom is a stabbing pain in the lower abdomen, at the edge of the pubic bone, and this stabbing pain radiates to the tip of the penis during urination.</p>
<p>治療此症，宜注意本症狀程度如何。宜於膀胱洗滌法者，有宜於温罨法者，有宜於服用利尿劑者，而最新化學療法，對此症尤有特殊之功效。但是對於治療此症時所用之手術，仍須敏捷熟練，否則若更破壞創口，猶火上添油，變本加厲，故尿中見血之淋病患者，切勿胡亂擇醫，和濫服市上成藥，宜求有經騐而肯負責之醫師治之。</p>
<p>To treat this symptom, you should pay attention to the severity of the symptom. Some should use the bladder lavage method, some should use the warm compress method, some should take diuretics, and the latest chemotherapy has a special effect on this symptom. However, the surgery used to treat this symptom must still be agile and skilled, otherwise, if the wound is further damaged, it will be like adding fuel to the fire, making the problem worse. Therefore, gonorrhea patients with blood in their urine must not choose a doctor rashly or take over-the-counter drugs indiscriminately. They should seek treatment from a doctor who is experienced and willing to take responsibility.</p>

<h3>Two People Fall to Their Deaths</h3>
<p>Why Did a University Girl Take Her Own Life? A Hospital Patient Suddenly Has Suicidal Thoughts</p>
<p>Mr. Yu, a Ningbo native, 49 years old, residing at a certain address on Avenue See Ang (西愛咸斯路) in the French Concession, previously worked in the salt administration. Since the outbreak of war, he had been unemployed. His eldest daughter, 25 years old this year, had just graduated from Guanghua University. She was inherently stubborn and recently, due to some incident, suddenly had suicidal thoughts. One day at 12:30 PM, she jumped from the third-floor sun deck in her home, sustaining head injuries. She immediately lost consciousness. Her family discovered her and rushed her to Guangci Hospital, but she died at 8:30 PM that afternoon due to the severity of her injuries. The hospital reported it to the police, who transported the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy station. Detectives were dispatched to investigate the cause of the suicide, pending a post-mortem examination. Additionally, Shen Jinsong, a young man from Shaoxing, 21 years old this year, residing at 1070 Avenue Joffre (霞飛路), worked as a servant for a foreigner. For the past year, he had been suffering from intermittent mental disorders, which would flare up and then subside. On the 30th of last month, the illness relapsed, and his family sent him to Guangci Hospital for treatment, where he was housed in a third-floor ward. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 PM one day, Shen's illness worsened, and he suddenly had suicidal thoughts. Taking advantage of the nurse's inattention, he jumped out of the window, sustaining head injuries and dying instantly. The Shaoxing natives discovered it and informed the accounts room, which reported it to the French police. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy station. Yesterday morning, the police reported to Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, who, accompanied by a forensic doctor, arrived at the station. The autopsy confirmed that both deaths were caused by injuries sustained from falls. Yu's body was claimed by her father after signing a guarantee. Since no relatives of Shen Jinsong came forward, the authorities ordered the Tongren Fuyuan Hall to prepare the body for burial, pending identification by relatives.</p>
<h3>Rampant Cable Thieves - Receivers of Stolen Goods Apprehended</h3>
<p>Recently, a group of thieves has been risking life and limb by scaling barbed wire fences into the Japanese military restricted area on Hongqiao Road to steal valuable electrical cables. These cables are quite expensive, made of pure copper, and installed by the Shanghai Power Company to provide electricity to residents and factories relocating to the Hongqiao area. After these thieves cut the cables, one end often falls to the ground, and countless passersby have been electrocuted to death due to carelessness. The French Police Department recently received a tip that Yin Jiayu (nickname "Little Nanjing"), a Nanjing native who runs the Hongtai Yuan Copper and Tin Shop at 314 Rue de Zikawei (姚主敎路), specializes in receiving these stolen goods. Plainclothes detectives were dispatched to the address and apprehended Yin on the spot, confiscating a large quantity of stolen goods, which were all taken to the police station. After investigation, the case will be transferred to the court today for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Car Accident - Woman Killed</h3>
<p>Chen Qinsheng, a 51-year-old Cantonese native, owner of the Tian Ji Tang Chinese medicine shop at 1289 Avenue Edward VII (愛多亞路) in the British Concession, was returning to the shop from outside one day at 5:30 PM with his third wife, Ms. Li (49-year-old Cantonese native), hand in hand, walking from east to west in front of 647 Avenue Edward VII (愛多亞路) in the French Concession. In the middle of the road, a Ningbo native named Zhuo, residing on Rue Mgr. Favier (趙主敎路) in the French Concession, was driving his private car, license number 11918, in the same direction, speeding towards them from behind. Chen and Ms. Li were unable to avoid it and were knocked to the ground, suffering injuries to their chest and knees. The patrolmen arrived and took the driver of the car to the police station. The injured woman was rushed to Guangci Hospital but died before treatment could be administered. Her body was transferred to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch autopsy station. After being released on bail by the police station, the car owner hired someone to negotiate with the victim's family, compensating them with 2,650 yuan. Meanwhile, he planned to request lenient treatment from the police station. Yesterday morning, the police reported to Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, who arrived at the station to examine the body. The investigating officer reported the details of the accident. The victim's husband, Chen Qinsheng, requested to claim the body for burial. After questioning the defendant about the accident, the prosecutor ruled that Chen Li's death was caused by being struck by a car. The body was released to Chen Qinsheng for burial, and the defendant was handed over to the police department for prosecution.</p>
<h3>Drug Dealers Apprehended in a Songjiang Hotel - Drugs and Other Items Confiscated</h3>
<p>Ye Yusi, a Chinese detective chief of the Narcotics Department of the Public Security Bureau, and detectives Li Shugui and Liu Zhaonian, learned that someone was secretly selling heroin and other drugs in Room 5 of the Songjiang Hotel at 7 Lane 446 Zhejiang Road. Several days ago, they instructed their associates to purchase half an ounce of drugs for 45 yuan. Yesterday, using marked banknotes worth 45 yuan, they purchased another half ounce, then immediately, along with Chinese detectives Zhao Baosheng and Guo Shouxin, rushed to make an arrest. They apprehended Zhang Xiangshun, a Ningbo native, in the room, and found the 45 yuan in banknotes that the police had provided in his pocket. Zhang confessed that he had purchased the drugs from Wang Yongqing (also known as Bingchen or Little Wang), a Ningbo native at 10 Lane 221 North Hai'an Road. They then went to arrest Wang, confiscating seven ounces of coffee essence, a hidden compartment, and two checkbooks from the China Reclamation Bank. It was found that from April 20 to July 31 of this year, Wang had made withdrawals from the Reclamation Bank totaling 17,496 yuan, with only 9 yuan and 98 cents remaining. This morning, they were sent to the First Special Court for defense. Jiang Baolian, the police lawyer, filed charges under the narcotics control regulations, and requested a postponement of the trial, citing the need to apprehend accomplices Liu Zhuolong and Wang Kaiqiao. After questioning by Judge Qian Hongye, he ordered them to be remanded in custody for a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>The "Anti-Smoking Bureau" -滥用濫發印花 Abusive Issuance of Stamps</h3>
<p>After the establishment of the "Renovation Anti-Smoking Bureau" (維新戒烟總局), "Director" Zhu Yao (字旭初) immediately began to control the local opium shops in the counties and regions under his jurisdiction. Recently, he printed one million stamps, each priced at 1.8 yuan, and instructed the "branch bureaus" to order all local shops to purchase and affix them. This would increase revenue by 1.8 million yuan. In the future, if any un-stamped opium is discovered, it will be treated as contraband, and the license will be revoked as punishment. Therefore, the opium merchants in various places were extremely alarmed and have repeatedly gathered to discuss countermeasures. However, it is rumored that Wang Shao Cheng, the owner of the central opium shop, has received hints from Zhu and is helping to smooth things over. However, there is no goodwill towards Wang in various places, so it is feared that everyone will still go to extremes.</p>
<h3>Gatekeeper's Gun Stolen by Bandits</h3>
<p>At Lane 154, Yidingpan Road in West Shanghai, a Chinese police gatekeeper was on duty. Yesterday morning around 6:00 AM, three thugs suddenly appeared at the entrance of the lane, wielding weapons and surrounding the on-duty gatekeeper No. 2130, threatening him not to move. They immediately snatched the service pistol that the policeman was carrying and fled. The Chinese police officer was unable to catch up and quickly reported the incident to the Jing'an Temple police station for investigation and record.</p>
<h3>The Huangpu River Yesterday Morning - Tide Level Even Higher</h3>
<p>Typhoon Turns Direction - Shanghai Can Avoid Being Hit</p>
<p>Since the day before yesterday, the Huangpu River has been experiencing a sudden high tide. Yesterday morning at 0:00, the tide level was even higher, measuring over 11 feet. The distance from the riverbank of the Bund was only a little over one foot. Areas such as Gansu Road and Jiangxi Road all had water rising from the sewers. It had not completely receded by 9:00 AM. Today around 2:00 PM, there will still be a high tide, and this high tide will not subside until the 5th of this month. According to the Xujiahui Observatory's report at 2:00 PM yesterday, two new typhoons have formed near the Ryukyu Islands in the Pacific Ocean. One has already reached east of Chichijima Island, a Japanese territory, and has exceeded the scope of the Pacific Ocean region, so the observatory is not paying attention to it. The second typhoon had reached 27 degrees north latitude and 131 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM yesterday, heading north-northeast or north-east. The center of the storm is within 60 nautical miles. Shanghai can avoid being hit.</p>
<h3>Fire at the Duchen Hotel on the Corner of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road - The Manager's Bedroom Destroyed</h3>
<p>The Duchen Hotel, a magnificent building made of steel and concrete located on Jiangxi Road and Fourth Road, suddenly caught fire at 9:00 PM one day. Thick smoke filled the air. The Central District Fire Brigade arrived to put out the fire. It is said that the fire started under the bed in the bedroom of the hotel manager, Erlangi. At the time, Erlangi was not in the room, so the firemen had to force open the door. The room was slightly damaged.</p>
<h3>Toy Gun Borrowed From a Child Used in Bank Robbery - Arrested</h3>
<p>Tricked into Buying Gold Jewelry, Then Brandished a Gun - Discovered It Was a Fake Gun, Shouted for Police, Apprehended</p>
<p>At the Lao Fengxiang Jewelry Store at 777 Xin Zha Road, around 4:00 PM one day, a customer went to select a gold bracelet and two gold rings. The store clerks Zhu Zhiyi and Wu Peizhang came forward to serve him, handing over the goods for inspection. Unexpectedly, the customer hid them in his pocket and suddenly took out a gun to threaten them, grabbed the stolen goods, turned around, and fled. The clerks realized that the customer was holding a fake gun, so they chased after him, shouting for the police. Police officers No. 1787 and No. 1394 arrived and helped to apprehend him, confiscating the fake gun and all the original stolen goods. He was taken to the Xin Zha Police Station, where Chinese detective Yang Xinzheng questioned him. According to his statement, his name is Chen Guang'an, a Shaoxing native, who previously worked as a clerk in a jewelry store. At 10:00 AM on the 1st of last month, he was given 152 yuan in legal tender by Chen Xu, a female relative residing at 32 Lane 49 North Zhejiang Road, to buy cigarette paper. He lost all the money at the Rongsheng Company Casino in West Shanghai and could not make it up. He had ill intentions. He suddenly remembered that a child named Hu Xiaohan, who lives in a barbershop at 841 Tiantong Road, usually plays with a fake gun that looks very realistic, so he went to borrow the fake gun from Hu yesterday and used it to rob the Lao Fengxiang. The detectives obtained the confession and immediately went to Chen Xu and Hu Xiaohan to verify the facts. It was confirmed to be true. They ordered Chen Guang'an to be detained and transferred to the Sixth Criminal Court of the First Special Court this morning. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the above situation and filed charges of robbery. Zhu Zhiyi, a clerk at the Lao Fengxiang, submitted a case file to testify to the situation at the time. The defendant was questioned and confessed without denial. Judge Xiao reviewed the confession and ordered Chen to be remanded in custody for a rescheduled hearing in seven days. The stolen goods were returned to the owner.</p>
<p>Another Fake Gun - Robbery Exposed</p>
<p>At 8:00 PM one day, two thieves broke into Yang Liu Chun Noodle Shop at 185 Zhejiang Road, intending to rob the gold rings worn by the shop owners, Shen Maosheng and Shen Yongqing, father and son. At that time, Shen and others realized that the gun held by one of the thieves was fake, so they shouted for the police. The thieves were afraid and fled. Xie Ahui, a passerby, apprehended one of the thieves, Chen Hailong, a Haimen native, and handed him over to Chinese detective Wang Shanqing, who took him to the Lao Zha Police Station. This morning, he was transferred to the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed charges of robbery in collusion. Because it was still necessary to investigate the accomplices, he requested permission to postpone the hearing. After questioning by Judge Qian, he ordered him to be remanded in custody for a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<p>Gang of Bandits Caught in a Playground</p>
<p>Wang Jiaju, the Chinese Detective Chief of the Lao Zha Police Station, along with Chinese detectives Sun Dafa and Zhang Bingchun, apprehended three bandits, Zheng A-zhen, Wang A-yan, and Zhang Youliang, in the Grand Peking Opera Theater at the Xianshi Amusement Park. After their confession, a pistol and four bullets were confiscated from the Shenghongtai Wine Shop at 386 Zhejiang Road. It was found that the pistol belonged to the Dutch Bank on the Bund and was stolen by Zheng when he was employed there. This morning, they were transferred to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian believed that it was necessary to investigate whether the defendants had committed any crimes within the concession, so he requested a postponement of the trial. After questioning by Judge Qian, he approved a postponement of the hearing for one week.</p>
<h3>Salaries of Judges in Both Courts Restored to Original Level - Approved by the Ministry of Justice</h3>
<p>According to the Huawen News Agency, all judges and prosecutors of the Shanghai First and Second Special District Local Courts and the Second and Third Branch Courts of the Higher Court, which belong to the Public Concession and the French Concession, jointly submitted a request to the Chongqing Judicial Administration Department to cancel the method of paying salaries at 70% of the pre-war level due to the rising prices of goods and the difficulties in life, and to restore the original pre-war salaries and pay them in full. According to news from the judicial community, the request has been approved by the Judicial Administration Department. However, the official order is still en route due to the inconvenient transportation between Shanghai and Chongqing, so it will take some time before it is issued to the court. All judges are said to be satisfied with the news. At the same time, the daily treatment of the court clerks and servants of the First Special District Court is very ordinary, with the highest monthly salary being only 20 yuan and the lowest being only 14 yuan. It is not enough to support a family, and even personal life will be insufficient, especially during this time of expensive rice and high wages. Therefore, the court also decided to present a request to the president of the First Special Court and the Second Branch Court of the Higher Court to request a salary increase.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Expected to Fall - Due to Large Quantities of Hongji Coal Arriving in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The price of coal in the city previously increased due to limited inventory, scarce sources, and high demand from factories and coal briquette factories. In late last month, prices rose step by step. Recently, large quantities of Hongji coal and Yanbai coal have been transported, totaling over 1,000 tons. At the same time, all factories have prepared enough coal, so the trading volume in the market yesterday was extremely light. According to industry insiders, since a large amount of coal has been transported to Shanghai, the market price has tended to fall back. Moreover, it is not the peak season for coal use, and a large number of orders from peers will be shipped soon, so the market price can be suppressed as a result.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Owners Refuse to Report Rental Prices - Business Licenses Withheld</h3>
<p>Because rickshaw merchants have repeatedly requested an increase in rickshaw rental prices, the Municipal Council ordered all rickshaw owners to fill out a survey form for lessees to investigate rental prices and current general conditions. All rickshaw owners were required to submit the forms by the end of July. Because 80 rickshaw owners did not fill out this form, the Municipal Council withheld the business licenses for this month from those who did not report when issuing them yesterday. They will only issue the licenses for business after the forms are filled out.</p>
<h3>Massage Girl Attempts Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Zhang Meizhen, a 20-year-old massage girl from Hangzhou at the Meimei Massage Parlor on Ningbo Road, had an argument with an old client surnamed Jia last night around 11:00 PM. Afterwards, she secretly took raw opium to commit suicide. Her close friend Li Juan hired a car and rushed her to the Baolong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Special Open-Air Music Program</h3>
<p>The Municipal Council Music Team is scheduled to hold two special open-air concerts at the French Park (French Association Grounds) from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM on the 3rd of this month and at the Zhaofeng Park from 9:00 PM to 11:00 PM on the 5th of this month. Ernest Krasso, a famous Austrian baritone, will join in singing many famous songs. The program includes six items and is extremely exciting. Both music venues have added stalls, and seat prices will be slightly increased, with assigned seats costing between 1.1 yuan to 1.1 yuan per person. Audience members who do not occupy a seat will still be charged the usual fee of 0.2 yuan per person. If the performance at the French Park on Thursday is canceled due to rain, the tickets sold can be used at the Zhaofeng Park on Saturday or at the rescheduled performance at the French Park next Thursday.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the editor, I am writing to you after reading the news item "Contesting for Second Landlord Results in Female Teacher Winning the Lawsuit" published in your newspaper on July 24th. There are some discrepancies with the facts, which I would like to list as follows: (1) This case is not at all a contest for a second landlord. The three-trial judgment confirms that the house was leased to the person concerned by Mr. and Mrs. Yu Zhong'e. How can there be any contest? (2) Ms. Lu Manqing and I did not know each other before. How can it be said that we have a sisterly friendship, confusing hearsay? I would appreciate it if you could correct it. Sincerely, Cai Jinying, July 29th.</p>
<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory predicted the weather at 4:30 PM yesterday, stating that Shandong and the East China Sea will have cloudy and clear weather with heat. There will be a north-to-east wind that will shift from mild to strong. There is a cyclone in the Ryukyu Islands, and the weather is bad. Because the typhoon is currently moving north to north-east, the center of the typhoon moved to within 60 miles of 27 degrees north latitude and 131 degrees east longitude at 2:00 PM yesterday. The wind direction is north to north-east, and the wind force is unknown. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in the city was 91.0 degrees and the lowest was 74.3 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 92.5 degrees and the lowest was 73.2 degrees.</p>

<h3>Soliciting Contributions</h3>
<p>The accounts officer of the Shengping Theater in this port must solicit contributions during the seasons or at the end of the year. This year, during the Dragon Boat Festival, they prepared many red invitations with the names of the accounts officers written inside, and distributed them to various officials, wealthy households, merchants, and prostitutes inside and outside the city, nominally inviting them to watch the opera, but in reality, soliciting contributions. Whether they came to watch or not, they had to send one or two silver dollars. Therefore, the households were unwilling. When the patrol captain heard about this, he immediately ordered the patrolmen to take the person who delivered the invitations and many red invitations to the police station. The police station then questioned Li, a Ningbo native, the accounts officer of Shengping. Li said that this happened every year, and it was all done by the accounts officers. Even the members of the Mixed Court had them, but it was not the responsibility of the accounts officer. Therefore, the patrol captain found it difficult to believe this and transferred him to the public hall yesterday for questioning. Li's statement was roughly the same as before, but he did not say that the members of the committee also had invitations. Li also said, "I currently run two shops in Xiaodongmen and have no bad reputation. This is indeed done by the accounts officers, and there is no Li's name on the invitations." Zhang Gong said, "I know your actions very well, why are you still so pretentious? Now you are even involving me, it is really ridiculous!" He ordered Li to be temporarily detained and waited for the four accounts officers to be brought in for questioning before making a decision. The next day, the review was held. The accounts officers claimed, "We four had no knowledge of the theater issuing invitations." Zhang Gong questioned Li again, but Li still tried to deny it. Therefore, Zhang Gong recounted his previous bad deeds one by one and ordered him to provide a guarantee to close the case.</p>

<h3>Finance - International Air is Still Good - Gold Price Easily Depreciates</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot red market situation, because the international situation is increasingly favorable to our country, and the European situation is gradually tense, foreign exchange has become stronger in the near term, and people's minds have also turned tired. Most of the multiple transactions have been holding a small profit policy, which leads to easy depreciation. This is the opposite of the situation in the past two days. Although a certain money exchange shop only filled out hundreds of taels at the initial opening, the buyer only had one or twenty taels of appetite, resulting in a lack of maintenance. It once fell to a low of 3,565 yuan. Later, due to a slight softening of foreign exchange, it aroused the buying atmosphere. A certain silver building came to add code again, and the securities gang and a certain command also tracked absorption. In addition, a certain money exchange shop also stopped plugging and vigorously moved forward. As a result, the market once turned strong and reached a peak of 3,660 yuan. After entering, it was heard that the securities gang had realized profits by taking advantage of the high, and the silver building gang frequently came to fill out, and the market situation was heavy and tired. As a result, it closed at 3,600 yuan, which was 40 yuan weaker than the previous day. The transaction was still strong, with about 800 taels of scenery. Silver building jewelry gold was finally listed at a small five yuan, and customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained stagnant.</p>
<h3>Red Squeezed Down Forty Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the morning, each bar (ten taels), the initial opening was ten yuan lower because the foreign exchange reported hard and people's hearts were tired. A certain money exchange shop sold ten taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 3,630 yuan. After opening, the foreign exchange still gradually softened and hardened, and a certain money exchange shop continued to vigorously fill out more than a hundred taels. In addition, the buyer's appetite was not healthy, and only one or twenty taels were eaten. Therefore, it fell 65 yuan in sparse transactions. A certain money exchange shop sold another ten taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 3,565 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange shop had stopped plugging and was watching, and the silver building gang absorbed by taking advantage of the low, which led to the market situation upward. It soon returned to outside the 3,600 yuan mark. The silver building gang entered the money exchange shop for ten taels at a price of 3,615 yuan. At that time, it was heard that the foreign exchange suddenly stopped softening and tended to tighten, and the buying atmosphere was even stronger. The securities gang and a certain silver building competed to absorb, and a certain money exchange shop came to re-enter, and the market situation was even stronger. It soared another 45 yuan. A certain silver building entered the gold shop for fifty taels at a price of 3,660 yuan. After 11:30, the securities gang suddenly took advantage of the high to come out of the cage, and a certain silver number also came to fill out, and the market situation turned tired. It immediately shed 40 yuan. A certain money exchange shop sold twenty taels to a certain gold shop at a price of 3,620 yuan. Then a certain gold shop叉 entered a certain silver building for 40 taels at a price of 3,626 yuan. Later, the securities gang sold twenty taels to the money exchange shop, with 3,620 yuan as the mid-day closing price. It was heard that after the closing, there were sellers at 3,610 yuan but no entrants. The market situation in the afternoon was still tired. The opening was 20 yuan lower than the mid-day closing. The gold shop sold ten taels to the money exchange shop at a price of 3,600 yuan. At that time, the securities gang came to absorb slightly, and once returned high. The securities gang entered a certain silver number for fifty taels at a price of 3,612 yuan. Later, due to the frequent filling out by the silver building gang, it re-traveled downstream. The silver building gang sold thirty taels to the money exchange shop, with 3,600 yuan as the late closing price. As a result, it squeezed down 40 yuan compared to the previous day. The whole day fluctuated by 95 yuan. The selling price of the current gold number's own brand gold was 10 yuan higher according to the red squeeze. The current standard gold is about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold. According to inquiries, there is little news of transactions.</p>

<h3>Increased Sales Through Multiple Channels; Spot and Forward Exchange Rates Both Ease</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw no change in HSBC's listed rates. In the unofficial market for British and American currencies, due to reports that Britain, America, and France were actively discussing aid for Chinese legal tender, and rumors that the British side in the Anglo-Japanese negotiations refused to discuss the silver China had deposited in Tianjin, many became even more eager to sell. The Japanese bank and speculators competed to unload their holdings. Coupled with sluggish demand from non-specialists, the market trend strengthened. The British pound once eased to four pence per bull, and the US dollar once strengthened to 8.71875 yuan. Later, due to strong demand from the Bank of England and HSBC at 4.5 pence for the British pound, and foreign firms taking advantage of the low prices to buy, the situation turned soft. As a result, the British pound closed at .03125, and the US dollar strengthened to .0625. Because demand for forward contracts this month was even weaker, the situation was looser than in the spot market. The British pound strengthened to 4.25 pence, and the US dollar eased to 8.25 yuan. Later, New China Foreign Firm and the Japanese bank and others successively aggressively bought, leading to a slight rebound. Ultimately, the British pound still closed .1875 stronger, and the US dollar weakened .34375. Swap rates became tighter. Compared to the midday closing, the British pound difference was .21875, and the US dollar difference was .46875, yielding a monthly interest rate (excluding commission) of 5.3%. Arbitrageurs could only actually collect 3.125 US dollars, yielding a monthly interest rate of only 3.78%. Trading was brisk for half the day. The Hong Kong exchange rate was reported to be 30.0375 yuan for the bank's selling price.</p>
<h3>New China Firm's Purchases Stabilize Market</h3>
<p>In the early morning, London's large-scale, recent fixing stabilized. The forward rate retreated .0625. The New York silver price was stagnant, and London raw gold remained flat. The exchange rates between British, American, Shanghai, and French currencies showed no change. The exchange rates between American, British, Shanghai, and French currencies were also unchanged. The central bank's listed rates remained the same. The bank's opening spot selling prices were 4.375 pence for the British pound and 8.5625 yuan for the US dollar, unchanged for the British pound and .03125 stronger for the US dollar compared to the previous close. After the opening, the Japanese bank and Chinese speculators competed to sell, coupled with scarce settlement transactions from foreign firms, leading to a strengthening market trend. The Japanese bank and speculators successively offered the spot British pound to Foreign Bank China-Belgium and Banque Franco-Chinoise at 4.4375 and 4.6875 pence, and the spot US dollar at 8.625 and 8.6875 yuan. When HSBC's listed rates were announced unchanged, and the silver equalization tax was confirmed to remain minimal, a certain American bank offered spot British pounds to HSBC at a high of 4.5 pence, while the spot US dollar also eased to 8.71875 yuan. At that time, foreign banks were mutually trading this month's US dollar at a high of 8.25 yuan, and this month's British pound was easing to 4.25 pence. After 11:00 AM, New China Foreign Firm suddenly purchased this month's US dollar from an American bank at 8.0625 and 8.125 yuan. Subsequently, the Japanese bank also absorbed this month's British pound from foreign banks at 4.1875 and 4.15625 pence, which slightly stabilized the situation. Near noon, a certain foreign firm settled its account with Banque Franco-Chinoise for spot British pounds at 4.40625 pence. At the midday close, the bank's spot selling prices were 4.40625 pence for the British pound and 8.59375 yuan for the US dollar, and this month's British pound at 4.1875 pence and US dollar at 8.125 yuan. Compared to the previous day's spot rates, the British pound eased .03125, and the US dollar strengthened .0625. This month's British pound was cheaper by .1875, and the US dollar eased .34375. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

The Shanghai exchange rate continued to fall 7 yuan, to 120 yuan. The "Joint Note" in the unofficial market rose half a yuan, to 101.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Market Weak</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies (British and American gold pounds) weakened and declined due to the easing trend in the foreign exchange market and the weak supply and demand relationship. The demand for British and American gold notes was relatively scarce, and the market situation was weak. The supply of Hong Kong and Australian gold notes was slightly excessive, and they all declined. Only Italian notes saw strong demand and rose. The supply and demand for Japanese gold notes was quite strong, and the market was slightly flat, with the evening market at 1.057 yuan. Demand for Korean notes was sluggish and weak, with the evening market at 0.875 yuan. There were very few transactions in the guild. Xiangtai sold 2,000 French franc notes from Fuhexiang. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds fall by 2 yuan, British gold notes fall by 1.1 yuan, American gold notes fall by 0.2 yuan, Hong Kong notes fall by 0.04 yuan, and Australian gold notes fall by 0.5 yuan. Other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Rise, Foreign Stocks Neglected</h3>
<p>In the securities unofficial market, yesterday's market suddenly surged due to some short covering. Category A bonds rose sharply by 1.9 yuan due to the upcoming lottery. However, because banks did not allow them to be used as collateral, many did not dare to trade them. Over-the-counter trading was the most lively. British and American sentiments towards China remained unchanged. The Tianjin incident unexpectedly affected the market, and people's minds were settled. Because the ex-dividend price and the cum-dividend price were already equal, many sold their holdings. The trend may stabilize for a while. When the market first opened yesterday, people still felt uncertain, and the prices were almost the same as the previous day. Subsequently, with strong demand, market prices gradually increased. Tongkang, Tongshun, Lianhe, and Lianyi successively bought to cover short positions and go long. Category A bonds were raised to over 5 yuan. The selling side was slightly weaker. Paper Songmao, Yuankang, and Yongkang supplied a lot. Other retail investors also sold. Market makers created hype, and there were rumors of a joint US-French-British effort to maintain legal tender, which was a bit too much. As a result, market prices rose another 1.25 to 1.9 yuan. The total transaction volume was about 1.2 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Category A Unified Bond 5.50 54.00 5.50 Up 1.90</p>
<p>Category B Unified Bond 45.60 44.70 45.30 Up 1.65</p>
<p>Category C Unified Bond 43.00 41.95 43.10 Up 1.35</p>
<p>Category D Unified Bond 41.80 —— 41.80 Up 1.35</p>
<p>Category E Unified Bond 42.40 41.50 42.40 Up 1.25</p>
<p>Stock trading was only a small amount on the Chinese Securities Exchange, with a price of 28 yuan.</p>
<p>The Public Industry Association reported that yesterday's market atmosphere was light and transactions were very scarce. The money supply seemed to be easing, and exchange rates and discounts have fallen. The spread between near and far foreign exchange rates has also changed slightly. This is optimistic for the stock market. If it can continue like this, stock prices should improve later. But at present, the market is still negligent.</p>
<p>London Far East companies' stock market prices on the 1st of this month (Monday) mostly fell. HSBC shares fell half a pound, with British registered shares at 74.5 pounds and Hong Kong registered shares at 76.5 pounds. Korean Coal Mine shares fell 3 pence, to 4 shillings and 6 pence. Kula Kelin Rubber shares fell 6 pence, remaining at 17 shillings and 6 pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>London China Foreign Debt market prices on the 1st of this month (Monday) had slight fluctuations. The Reorganization Loan British issued bonds rose half a pound, with a price of 19 pounds. The Vickers Airplane Loan and Longhai Railway Bonds each fell 1 pound, with prices of 11 pounds each. The Beining Railway Bonds, after the dividend, had a new price of 43 pounds, down 1 pound from before. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Japanese Yarn Higher Than Local Yarn; Speculators Even More Enthusiastic; Special Jincheng Creates New Prices</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose and then fell back, resulting in a flat outcome. However, yarn destined to the south, and yarn that was physically missing, all still saw price increases. The upward trend was originally moderate, but unfortunately, the general public was stimulated by rumors and friends' enthusiasm, reorganized their forces, and came to buy again. Therefore, although foreign exchange was stable and cash was not frantically sought, the cotton yarn market alone saw an increase. Some believe that the factory does not release goods, so it is better to hoard cotton yarn. In addition, the price of Japanese yarn is higher than that of Chinese yarn, so buyers are very enthusiastic. The recent surge in yarn and cloth prices is the biggest factor. Special Jincheng 20s yarn has reached 690 yuan today because of eager purchases by the Hong Kong gang. This price can be said to have reached its peak.</p>
<p>Current yarn conditions: In the early morning, Guangbang Wanxing Company released yarn to absorb double-horse spot yarn, and the situation suddenly became tense. Dozens of bales were bought at a price of 596 yuan, an increase of 8 yuan over the previous day. Warehouse order prices initially opened at 577 yuan, then 580 yuan. After a short time, due to high prices and the emergence of more sellers, the market became crowded again. In less than a moment, it suddenly fell back. The warehouse order price was 572.5 yuan. Outer warehouse double-horse also fell to 588 yuan, similar to the previous day's price. The closing was also flat. According to half-day transaction statistics, 1,970 bales were traded, mostly among peers. The prices of double-horse remained flat, while special Jincheng increased by 15 yuan. Niche yarns also increased by 5 yuan. The Yong'an Factory opened 80 bales of Jincheng 20s yarn at a price of 690 yuan, and 200 bales of special Jincheng 10s yarn at a price of 640 yuan. Today, 19 cotton yarns were shipped to Yantai, 155 were shipped to Tianjin, 20 were shipped to Xiamen, 30 were shipped to Hong Kong, 60 were shipped to Guangzhou Bay, and 30 were shipped to Beihai. The amounts purchased by each gang are listed separately below:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 830 Peers 955</p>
<p>(Tianjin) 150 Inland 35</p>
<p>Total 1,970</p>
<p>There are two reasons for the recent surge in the Japanese yarn market: (1) According to the market, the export of local products in the north is booming. To avoid losses, merchants are converting their funds into Japanese yarn and cloth and transporting them back to their hometowns. (2) It is also said that a certain banknote will be used next month. The idea of hoarding goods among merchants is becoming more enthusiastic. Therefore, the trade of Japanese yarn and cotton cloth in the north has greatly progressed.</p>
<h3>Japanese Factories Lack Raw Materials; Indian Cotton Continues to Be Traded</h3>
<p>The domestic cotton trade is still at a standstill, but the Indian cotton business continues unabated. The amount of transactions between traders has been huge for consecutive days. However, most of these transactions are transferred to Japanese factories for use, and Japanese foreign firms and Japanese factories have purchased 600 pieces today, which shows that the factory's stock of cotton is insufficient and needs to be supplemented at any time.</p>
<p>Howard &amp; Sons 117.00 Toyota Factory enters 400 pieces. Cash sent to the factory.</p>
<p>Pengjiapu 120.00 Nisshin Bank enters 200 pieces. Again, warehouse delivery.</p>
<p>Again 130.00 Yezhong enters 200 pieces. Again, again.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton trade, the trade is gradually booming due to the recent reduction in the discount rate and the easing of money supply. However, the transactions are limited to the hands of the same industry, because their selling prices are about 20 yuan cheaper per picul than the foreign firm's prices. The Japanese factories are more in demand, because their stocks are low.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton market, initially fell 3 to 8 points due to the liquidation of long positions among peers and selling. Later, cotton-producing areas reported bad weather, and there were no new purchases. According to people in the industry, several large Chinese yarn factories have sufficient reserves of raw materials, enough to supply six or seven months, and can spin for at least three or four months. There is no problem with work. However, new yarn factories have relatively weak raw material reserves. The supply from northern Jiangsu is not strong, with 120 bales of Tong cotton arriving. Today, 40 pieces of cotton were shipped to Hong Kong, and 290 pieces of machine cotton were shipped to Ningbo. Here is the current state of cotton. The market price rose due to the enthusiasm of buyers, and then rose again due to government reports of reduced warehouse reserves, increased spot transactions in the south, and good telegrams from Liverpool. As a result, the closing price rose 8 points compared to the previous day. India was closed yesterday, and the forecast was flat. Egypt rose more than 10 pounds.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybeans and Sesame Cocoons Shipped to South China</h3>
<p>Today (the 3rd), 20 bags of soybeans were shipped to Xiamen, and 830 bags were shipped to Hong Kong. Another 20 bags of sesame were also shipped to Xiamen.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Becomes a Rare Commodity; Rice Merchants Refuse to Show Samples</h3>
<p>Dujian Rice: Yesterday, the amount of rice from the river arriving at port was 12 shipments of Songjiang and Nangang early and late rice. There were more than 2,000 bundles of round steamed buns. There were rumors in the market that it would be difficult to continue shipments from the river after this batch. Rice merchants hope that the source will be interrupted from time to time so that they can hoard and speculate. The opening of Wuhu was obstructed by some party and has not been implemented. After the first batch of Dongxin rice arrived in Shanghai, the second batch was also hindered on the way and has not yet arrived. It is said that there are more than 200,000 bags in Shanghai warehouses, of which only 40,000 bags are of japonica rice and 5,000 bags are of glutinous rice. The rest are all pointed rice. Since the market situation turned positive yesterday, guest merchants and hoarders have been hoarding and speculating again. The high-priced goods of both thick and thin japonica are not being sampled, and the general stock is scarce. The sales market in this street is very lively. In the city, Wuxi old yellow japonica rice is selling for 20 yuan, Zhouzhuang japonica rice is selling for 20 yuan, and Jue Wuhu pointed rice is selling for 16 yuan, and Po pointed rice is selling for 15.8 yuan, variable yuan is 22 yuan, and Hong Kong glutinous rice is 22.5 yuan, with a transaction volume of more than 2,700 shi. Off-market transactions are not included in this number, and off-market bidding has risen again. However, because the municipal council stationed staff to supervise the market is very strict, the actions are furtive and there is no way to report the truth. However, it is heard that the off-market transaction price has reached 23 yuan for japonica rice and 18 yuan for high pointed rice. The rise in rice prices is due to the rice merchants and some parties exploiting each other, one manipulating and hoarding, and the other extorting a lot, wanting to make the lives of Shanghai people noble and unable to live here for a long time, which shows the poisonousness of their hearts.</p>
<p>Ke Xian: The move to open up the producing area has not yet been officially confirmed, and the goods side is afraid that opening up will be hopeless, so they continue to hold on. However, the store stock is very dry, and the market appetite is greedy. When off-market japonica rice is too expensive, they are more interested in the low-priced Ke Xian. However, high Xian rice such as Nanjing Xian has been bid up to 19 yuan, and high Wuhu Xian rice is 18.5 yuan, which is far from the limited price, so the price of 16 yuan is only decorated with hot old Jue rice. Even Po rice has reached 16 yuan, up another half yuan to 67 corners from the previous market.</p>
<p>Yang Rice: Yesterday, because of the soaring prices of various rice, the new Saigon rice caught the attention of stores and retailers. 500 bags were sold, with a price of 25.7 yuan, which is about 7 corners higher than the price at the beginning of the week.</p>
<h3>Wheat Released for Purchase; Flour Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday's trade in spot flour was particularly lively. Because there are various sales channels, and the factory's raw material costs are high, and rice prices are rising sharply, although flour prices have reached 5 yuan, they are still relatively cheap. Therefore, they are still restricting large ticket customers' hoarding needs. The price of goods returned to the market has also increased. Yesterday, both domestic and foreign customers were absorbing, and the total transaction volume continued to be nearly 40,000 bags. The price of No. 2 flour factory is consistently 5 yuan in cash. The selling price of returned goods still has differences. Today, 500 bags of flour were shipped to Weihaiwei.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, new wheat arrived one after another. Both the Shanghai-Ningbo and Tianjin-Pukou lines had shipments. There were also a lot of goods in storage. After the factory officially purchased, the trade was brisk and prosperous. Fuxin Factory added 1,500 bags. However, the market valued the purchase. Hoarders also purchased 2,000 bags of high and medium wheat. Because the market had both supply and demand, the price was loosened by a few cents. Kunshan wheat opened at 6.9 to 6.8 yuan, Danyang Daqiao opened at 6.8 yuan, and Qishuyan opened at 6.6 yuan. Nanjing Caishiji wheat opened at 6.6 to 6.36 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Coarse Cloth and Fine Materials, Selling Prices All Rise by One Yuan; Sales of Various Cloths Soar</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth:</p>
<p>Yesterday, the rising trend of the cloth market intensified. Yihua's 16-pound Double Elephant coarse cloth was continuously searched for by the Shandong gang, and spot goods were hoarded and speculated. Each piece was raised to 17.75 yuan, an increase of 1 yuan compared to before. Yihua's Three Rabbits and Three Peaches and other fine twills also rose sharply by one yuan. The increase was due to soaring market prices in East Piece Goods, and wholesale stores and dyeing factories in this street had purchases. Other brands of white goods and dyed cloths also increased prices, with many differences. In the afternoon, the cash discount rate rose sharply, and the price of goods began to fall back slightly. The current sales in this street are the strongest. More than 400 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, serge, broadcloth, flannel, and silk crepe were traded. The Yong Gang purchased 100 boxes of colored cloth and colored twill. The Yue Gang purchased 780 boxes of fine twill, serge, and colored twill. The Shandong Gang purchased 40-50 bales of 16-pound coarse cloth. The Kingdom of Siam purchased thousands of pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, serge, printed flannel. Wholesale to Jiangsu and Zhejiang interior increased.</p>
<p>East Piece Goods:</p>
<p>In the morning market, the selling price rose again due to the continued purchase of fine cloth and fine twill by the Tianjin gang. The spot price of 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth opened at 16.9 yuan per piece. The forward price for the next month soared to 17.1 yuan. Later, due to the excessive increase and the high cash discount, the market appetite in this street turned back and gradually softened. As a result, the Dragon Head fine cloth was 16.6 yuan, which was still an increase of 40 cents per piece compared to the previous day's market. A total of 500 pieces were traded throughout the day purchased by the North Gang. Only 1-200 pieces were actually sold in this street. The market price of Sijunzi serge and Zhigong serge has been raised to 49 cents per yard.</p>
<p>Export:</p>
<p>Today (the 3rd), 30 pieces of cloth were shipped to Yantai, 70 pieces were shipped to Tianjin, 40 pieces were shipped to Xiamen, 7 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong, and 20 pieces were shipped to Guangzhou Bay.</p>
<h3>Concerns about Customs Gold in the Broadcloth and Wool Market</h3>
<p>The selling price of broadcloth and wool has risen since the foreign exchange rate began to plunge, without exception. However, according to the current exchange rate, it is not possible to make a profit. Unexpectedly, new and strange news has come out from the foreign side recently, saying that the customs gold is about to change. (1) The current customs gold of 2.39 yuan will soon be doubled to 4.78 yuan. (2) It is said that taxes must be paid in "Huaxing" banknotes, and even using legal currency to buy "Huaxing" counterfeit banknotes will require a discount of 230 cents per yuan. If the first statement becomes a reality, the cost of broadcloth and wool will increase by one cent. The second statement, which aims to maintain the legal tender of all friendly countries, will not be destroyed.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Chinese Silk Sales to America are Promising</h3>
<p>In the local silk market, because the exchange rate has improved, the market price of products has been relatively reduced. White factory products are selling for around 2,500 yuan to foreign firms, but no one is selling. Seven- or eight-tenth white factory products are still selling for 3,120 yuan, with an estimated 30 dans traded. Yin Zhuang white earth silk rose 20 yuan, with an estimated 15 dans traded. The entire silk market feels quite hesitant, because the current silk price is supported by foreign exchange, so no one knows how long the silk price can maintain its high price. But on the other hand, the road for transporting cocoons from the mainland is still as closed as before. After the cancellation of foreign American and Japanese merchants, Chinese silk sales to America are bound to increase, so these two points seem to be optimistic for the silk price. Therefore, general cautious manufacturers only sell spot goods, and are reluctant to accept forward accounts. Therefore, although silk prices are high recently, transactions have not become lively.</p>
<p>Today (the 3rd), 18 pieces of raw silk were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Coarse White, Original, and Crystal Sugars Fall One Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, according to the London telegram, did not fluctuate much. August was 7 shillings and 0.75 pence, December was 6 shillings and 2.75 pence, and March of next year was 6 shillings and 3.25 pence. The local market's trend continued to be soft. Spot 24 coarse white sugar fell 9 corners in the original warehouse, to 32.5 yuan. Outer warehouse fell 1 yuan, to 32.2 yuan. Transshipment goods fell the same amount, to 24 yuan. Taikoo cart white sugar was a little bit over 23 corners, West Warehouse B mark was 38.2 yuan, OW mark was 37.8 yuan, OX mark was 37.6 yuan, DY mark was 37.2 yuan, HX mark was 37 yuan, Dutch red sugar was a little over 4 corners, spot was 28.6 yuan, transshipment was a little over 2 corners, to 22 yuan. Local cotton white sugar fell half a yuan, Zhenji No. 1 was 33 yuan, No. 2 was 32.5 yuan, No. 3 was 31 yuan, No. 4 was 31.5 yuan. Local No. 1 crystal sugar fell 1 yuan, to 38.5 yuan, Jingming crystal sugar was 40 yuan. Domestic sugar also showed a soft trend, resulting in a lack of transactions.</p>

<h3>Imperturbability</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Hearing bad news, we naturally frown and grit our teeth; similarly, hearing good news, we cannot help but nod and smile knowingly. Humans are emotional animals, and it is natural to express such emotions when affected by hateful or joyful fluctuations.</p>
<p>However, I believe that we casually express these emotions in ordinary times. In this extraordinary era, in this great era of resolutely resisting the war to build the nation, it is not appropriate, and it is not enough.</p>
<p>From the beginning, we have known the arduousness of our responsibilities, and we have long made up our minds to achieve our goals regardless of how the environment changes, with unwavering perseverance. Then, no matter how bad or good the external news is, we really have no reason to be emotional except for paying close attention and taking it as a reference. Moreover, hateful emotional expressions often lead to frustration, while joyful emotional expressions often lead to slackness. It is an inevitable result to be frustrated and demoralized, and to be lax and mentally scattered. We absolutely don't need it!</p>
<p>Imperturbability is what our predecessors called "not being moved by external things." This is a skill that all great figures of the past and present must cultivate. Of course, we people of the present may not all be great figures, but we are the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, the chosen people of heaven, and we dare not belittle ourselves. We are the citizens of a great country, and at this critical juncture of life and death, we must all remain unmoved.</p>
<p>We are by no means cold and heartless. In fact, our emotions are entirely entrusted to our country and nation, and have already exceeded the scope of ordinary emotions. Assuming that we are still unable to avoid frowning because of hatred and smiling because of joy, we must redouble our efforts outside of these smiles and frowns to fully express our emotions.</p>
<p>Before this complete expression of our emotions has been achieved, we can only remain unmoved. Although sometimes they are unfavorable to us, they do not seem to help us, but are mostly for their own benefit and not because of any resentment towards us. Similarly, except for ourselves, although they sometimes benefit us and seem to help us, they are often for their own benefit and not necessarily out of love for us. Then, why should we hate and rejoice because of them!</p>
<p>"Even if Mount Tai collapses in front of you, your expression does not change; even if a deer appears to your left, your eyes do not blink." We want this kind of imperturbability, and only look at the goal and run straight forward! Otherwise, bad or good news will continue to come, and we can only be emotionally impulsive. What else can we do?</p>
<h3>Local News</h3>
<p>— Ding Di</p>
<p>A small letter, twelve lines on old-fashioned red-grid paper. I almost cannot believe that it describes a young man's lament, a regrettable fate. He is not a decadent person, and that is not what should have happened. He is young, his future filled with light, flowers, and strength. He has talent, ambition, and youth.</p>
<p>Yet, he has ruined himself... I focused my eyes on the hurried handwriting.</p>
<p>"...I tell you, the air here is filled with a haze. Everyone seems to be stumbling in the clouds, walking with weak limbs, spending their days in a languid and affected manner, practically incapable of tying a chicken. Fortunately, everything is so convenient, there are no concerns whatsoever. Therefore, everyone loves this kind of enjoyment. White rice feeds their bellies, and black bread feeds their spirits. Without this indulgence, it is as if their entire body withers..."</p>
<p>However, doesn't it wither them even with their indulgence? I remember so many yellowish faces. They are still withered.</p>
<p>The letter continues:</p>
<p>"If you see Yun now, I'm afraid you won't recognize him. His mother weeps for him. Her well-intentioned pleas only result in her son's wild beatings. She can no longer live at home. Her son cannot support her. He has devoted his entire ambition, life, happiness, and loyalty to his addiction.</p>
<p>I truly cannot help but feel a bit melancholic. On my hometown's soil, a decision imprinted my fleeing footprints. It was early summer then, filled with turbulence and unrest. All the terrible fates were not yet fully arranged. Although I had seen many painful impressions, I had sneered at those demons and monsters, I had wanted to use my frail hands to twist away the threatening iron chains. Deceit silenced people, and coldness made them shiver. I experienced a lot. But the black terror was not yet this thick. The low-pressure air could not let through a trace of clear breathing, but at that time there was no fog, a black fog, a corrupt and suffocating breath.</p>
<p>A month later, an old woman with white hair and faltering steps came to my place. She was Yun's mother. She told me she came to Shanghai to live with her daughter and son-in-law. We talked about the recent situation in our hometown.</p>
<p>"The hometown now is not like it used to be. There are countless addicts. Everywhere you see signs that say 'Selling Smoking', and when people see these signs, they go inside to lie down and enjoy. It only becomes respectable at night. On the streets and alleys, lamps are lit up one by one, all of them are their advertisements..."</p>
<p>"Lamps, one by one." An extremely moving image hung before my eyes. I lamented, and I was also saddened.</p>
<p>"There are probably a hundred or more in the whole city, and dozens of retail shops outside. Probably at least thirty or forty shops." Hearing this, I could not help but stand up and shout hysterically. "A hundred or so shops, thirty or forty shops, how many people's fates have they buried! How many people standing on the shore are sinking into the sea, and those who have already sunk are falling deeper and deeper:"</p>
<p>An evil breath floated around my nose. I seemed to have already seen my hometown five hundred miles away.</p>
<p>The old woman showed me the bitten arm, saying that it was bitten by her son's teeth. Because she was trying to sell her jewelry to support his habit, and when she didn't agree, he used force.</p>
<p>"Sir, you also know that my son is not such a scoundrel, but fate has brought him to this point, what can be done... I, this old suffering soul, cannot rely on my son in this life... I cannot rely on my son... only in the next life... only..."</p>
<p>I stared blankly, watching her walk away crying.</p>
<p>That night, I had a dream. I used angry arms to kill those who willingly degenerate. The reality disappointed me. Is Yun the only one who has degenerated? No. There are countless young people tearing at their own flesh and blood, degenerating. I cannot kill them all. And there is also a big wolf supporting them, and when I try to kill them, the wolf steps forward. It bares its fangs, claws, and howls fiercely. There are many young people like Yun. The dark air envelops them, and an empty person loses the rudder of their center. However, is this only the sin of the degenerated? Besides this, there is an even greater culprit. This spreading mist, suffocating breath, the jackals that lead people to do evil.</p>
<p>"The air here is filled with a haze."</p>
<p>How many young people's fates are buried in the haze. And what else but the spirit of the elementary school teacher? Facing this shocking hometown news, I should be worried, and angry.</p>
<p>"Old Zhang, watch me! What will you do?"</p>

<h3>Throwing Old Dreams into the Shadows</h3>
<p>— Shi Ji</p>
<p>In the night,</p>
<p>I held the heavy</p>
<p>Splendid old dreams,</p>
<p>And walked towards the wilderness.</p>
<p>In the wilderness, there is a storm,</p>
<p>(How can there be stars there?!)</p>
<p>Hidden in the middle,</p>
<p>Those skeletons open their mouths wide</p>
<p>And grin,</p>
<p>In front of me,</p>
<p>Black hands reach out and wave,</p>
<p>Can I bear the heavy burden of the dream?</p>
<p>Now,</p>
<p>The old dream has been thrown into the shadows.</p>
<p>In the wilderness,</p>
<p>Although there is still</p>
<p>Storm,</p>
<p>The skeletons' grin...</p>
<p>But I feel as light as a swallow!</p>
<p>In the distance,</p>
<p>Aren't there sparse stars shining?</p>

<h3>Chaplin's New Film "The Dictator" to be Released in Autumn</h3>
<p>— New Shadow</p>
<p>Recently, news has come from Hollywood: that Sherif Silverstone, an important figure at United Artists, has indicated that the famous producer and star Charlie Chaplin's new film "The Dictator" will be released early this autumn. Chaplin is scheduled to spend a month shooting "The Dictator" into a film, and the story has already been written.</p>
<p>Chaplin himself will, as planned, play two roles. According to what Chaplin has indicated, the film's layout and story will of course involve dictators, but the most important goal is still to bring laughter to the audience. To apply the typical elements of comedy to the current political situation.</p>
<p>He believes that people generally find those who are overly solemn and have the highest power ultimately become the target of laughter. In "The Dictator," Chaplin himself, in addition to writing the story, serving as producer and director, also acts. So he has to take on several roles, and according to his own statement, this film will not only be the first time he speaks on screen, but its success will also surpass all the films he has directed before.</p>
<p>Sherif Silverstone further indicated that with a talent like Chaplin, who has a remarkable track record, to make this film, "The Dictator" will undoubtedly be United Artists' only blockbuster of 1939. Once filming is completed, it will be simultaneously released in cities around the world that welcome humorous works of film.</p>
<h3>On the Play "Xiangmei Temple"</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cang</p>
<p>The play "Xiangmei Temple" tells the story of Huang Chao's rebellion and the temple monk Liaokong's escape, which ultimately leads to his death. Although the characters in the play are comedic and villainous roles that work well together, in reality, the comedic role is much more important than the villainous role, because the villainous role in this play only emphasizes lines, posture, and demeanor. However, the role of Huang Chao must achieve a magnificent presence and a well-organized posture, with an imposing and unparalleled aura, to be considered top-notch. This is why Qian Jinfu's reputation is so outstanding. The role of Liaokong, entirely in rhyming dialogue, must be delivered with each word forceful and not floating, and the physical movements are even more complex and strenuous. The circling steps are very beautiful, and the most difficult part is the before-mentioned forward and backward leaning steps before entering the stage when escaping without a plan. Wang Changlin can perform this scene with lightness and grace, and even in his later years, he was not inferior, truly a masterpiece. In the previous scene of adding lamp oil and offering incense, Changlin's physical techniques and eyes are all excellent. This play was highly treasured by Wang in the old capital, and it was not often performed in theaters. It was only performed with Qian Jinfu at private gatherings where the host specifically requested it. Changlin almost never went south, but he did perform it many times. In fact, his first performance of "Xiangmei Temple" at sea was before 1921 (probably around 1918 or 1919), at a private gathering at the Shanghai residence of Mr. Tao Xiquan from Wujin, who was invited to Shanghai by the host and was highly praised by the guests. I still remember that in that private gathering, Yu Shuyan and Yang Baozhong also performed. Liaokong's costume includes a monk's hat, green monk's robe, and a comedic painted face, without much that is distinctive. However, for the role of Huang Chao, Qian Jinfu's costume in the previous scene consists of a blue pleated robe and a sword, while in the later scene, he wears a grass king helmet with feathers, a tail hanging behind (i.e., fox tail), a yellow python robe, and yellow armor. The facial makeup is an oil-red three-tile face with a gold coin shape painted on the forehead, and the eyebrows are similar to Wu Qi in "Xiangjianghui." Today's villainous roles all follow Jinfu's style, but in fact, the early Huang Chao's attire consisted of a large red leaf turban and a red velvet ball fringe.</p>
<p>The collaboration of Wang Changlin and Qian Jinfu in this play was naturally a famous and unparalleled performance. Before Changlin, there were many famous comedic actors, such as Ju Gan San, Luo Baishou, and Zhao Xianfang, but none of them were known for "Xiangmei Temple." The only one who excelled in this play and was outstanding in the opera world was Yang Mingyu. Mingyu was Yang San, the foremost comedic actor of Suzhou opera, skilled in Kunqu opera, and his singing, recitation, acting, and movements were all wonderful. After Yang San, there was a lack of successors, so there was a saying at the time, "After Yang San's death, there is no Kunqu comedic actor." When he performed "Xiangmei Temple," it was always performed on New Year's Lantern Festival night, which is also a story of the opera world. When Wang Changlin came to the first stage of Dangui with Yu Shuyan, I don't know who was paired with him as Huang Chao. When Yan Jupeng, Wang Yaoqing, and Wang Youqing came to the old common stage, Jiang Shao Kui was Huang Chao paired with Changlin in this play, which I heard personally. Changlin and Hao Shoushen also performed it in Shanghai. A few years ago, I saw a comedic actor perform this in the Great World Beijing Opera Troupe. Now, Liu Binkun of Golden Age is also known for this play.</p>
<p>In the early years, "Xiangmei Temple" was listed in the first three plays on the program. After Wang Changlin and Qian Jinfu rose to prominence in the opera world and their performance of this play became unmatched for a time, it was hailed by opera listeners as an unparalleled performance. The play was made famous by the performers, but how could Wang and Qian's skills be surpassed by later generations?</p>

<p>The Difference Between Inviting Performers Then and Now</p>
<p>Based on the various facts mentioned above, it can be seen that Xuzhou has always been a gathering place for famous performers. Therefore, Mr. Su Shaoqing and I have been familiar with many historical anecdotes of the opera world since childhood. Among them, the matter of inviting performers is particularly interesting. I will briefly describe it as follows.</p>
<p>In the past, no matter how famous a performer was, there was no concept of preparing their own private costumes. Except for some slightly famous older male roles, martial male roles, female roles, and comedic female roles who occasionally prepared their own beards, boots, gauze, hairnets, knives, spears, head wraps, beaded flowers, and small wooden boards for standing on tiptoe (i.e., embroidered shoes), all other costumes were temporarily borrowed from the costume boxes managed by the backstage staff. Therefore, it was extremely convenient for performers to travel and join different troupes. There was absolutely no trouble like today's famous performers carrying dozens of boxes when they leave Beijing. Precisely because it was so convenient to come and go, various strange stories of famous performers eloping often occurred. For example, the theater owners in several large ports near Xuzhou would inquire about which local theater had the best business and which performers were attracting the audience. Theater owners in Henan, such as Kaifeng and Zhengzhou, and in Anhui, such as Suzhou and Bengbu, would secretly send people with large sums of money to secretly carry out their work of hiring performers (formerly called "hooking performers"). The person sent not only had to be brave and knowledgeable, with sharp wit, but also had to be a tough guy who was not afraid of being beaten with sticks or stabbed with knives, so that he could fulfill his mission and return triumphantly.</p>
<p>At that time, transportation was inconvenient and the population was sparse. Even in famous towns, there were only four or five inns. Moreover, the innkeepers were usually familiar with the mule cart drivers. The innkeepers knew eight or nine things about the merchants who came from which direction, what kind of cart they were riding in, and what kind of business they were doing as soon as the mule cart entered the inn. At the same time, the theater owners often interacted with the innkeepers, taking care of each other and becoming close-knit. If the person who came to hire the performer was not careful and revealed their intentions, they would suffer a great loss immediately, and they could be beaten to a pulp, lose all their money, and return home with serious injuries in a disheveled state.
