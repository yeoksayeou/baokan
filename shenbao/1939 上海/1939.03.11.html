<p>社評</p>
<h3>再論中立法的修改問題</h3>
<p>本年初，美國第七十六屆國會復會的時候，羅斯福總統曾以咨文致國會，主張修改現行中立法。一月七日本報社評曾指出現行中立法不僅不足以保障美國不捲入戰爭的漩渦，而且消極地助長了侵略者的暴行，使她自己的合法利益，也屢被侵佔。美國要保持自己的合法利益，祗有積極起來，對侵略者採取有效的制裁。羅總統的要求修改中立法，便是制裁侵略者的初步辦法。故我人希望美國國會中的孤立派能覺悟以前的失策，把他們一手造成的，不分皂白的中立法，加以修改。藉以制止侵略者的暴行，可惜那時參院中的孤立派還是迷戀於陳舊的落伍觀念，把這問題重行擱置起來。</p>
<p>美國的孤立派還是相信美國靠了太平洋和大西洋的洪流，可以和歐洲菲洲遠東分開，儘管那兒戰雲瀰慢，美國總可不被捲入漩渦，所以現行中立法是不必修改的。在這些孤立派的主張佔着優勢的時候，侵略者深知祗要不直接侵犯美國，則美國除了空口贊助維持和平外，似乎還不會有所行動。於是她們就肆無忌憚，從事更積極的侵略。義國於英法承認西班牙的弗郎哥政權以後，又積極推動反法宣傳，增兵北菲，準備對法提出無理要求。德國也擬定了壓迫英法的計劃，準備在義國對法提出要求的時候，以最後通牒形式向英法提出要求，甚至要以迅電不及掩耳的手段、佔據荷蘭瑞士，迫令英法屈服。在另一方面，她們又趁着英法有事於地中海，無力顧及太平洋的機會，唆使日本發動南進政策，造成太平洋上的「九一八」，使美國在太平洋的利益飽受威脅。這就是孤立派硬耍實施現行中立法的結果。</p>
<p>最近修改中立法問題又成了美國國會中的中心問題。原來現行中立法中的「現金交易與運輸自行負責」一項的有效期間，將於五月一日期滿，自不得不重予討論。所謂「現金交易與運輸自行負責」，就是第三國向美國購買軍用品，須以「現金」交易，自己運輸。此種規定，對於侵略國和被侵略國同等待遇。因此這法案的實施，事實上完全便利了侵略國家。侵略國家的軍用品的生產量必大於被侵略者，被侵略者要抵抗侵略者，必要向第三國購置大量軍用品，但是被侵略者的經濟地位，大多數比較落後，於是在「現金交易」的規定之下，自難獲得大量的軍火供給。其次侵略國軍事上的設備，又比較完全，購了軍用品，有自己的商船可裝，有强大的海軍保護運輸，而被侵略國則既無商船又無軍艦。所以這中立法實施之後，侵略者倒並不因此而在美國買不到軍用品，而被侵略國却反被封鎖了。這無怪乎羅總統要大聲疾呼地說現行中立法不獨無補於和平，反而足以助長戰爭了。</p>
<p>據九日哈瓦斯社華盛頓電，美國國會若能把「現金交易與運輸自行負責」的實施範圍，加以擴大，則英法兩海軍國，既足控制海上交通，而財力充裕，又能用現金償付貨欵，可向美國獲取各項必需品，比各全能國，自佔便宜。美國國會倘果眞通過實施這種辦法，則她在歐洲，固可為英法的盟友、但在亞洲却不免要做日本的與國了。我們以為高瞻遠矚，努力於世界和平的議員們，是决不願意贊同這種辦法的。我們希望國會能通過議員湯姆斯的建議：授權總統與國會，對於任何國家，凡違反美國所已簽字的國際條約的，都得判定她為侵略國，同時並以軍火接濟被侵略者。這樣才能切實制止侵略者的暴行，保持世界和平，維護美國的合法利益。</p>

<h3>津漢美商會　要求制裁日本　英大使向日本外務省交涉　華北偽幣無法流通各地</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）據美國商務部今日稱、華北美國商人會請美國政府採取進一步行動、保護美人在日本佔領區中之權益、據華北美國商人言、日人明日實施之華北滙兌及貿易統制辦法、目的在排除美國在華北之商業、日人藉其傀儡、推行限制輸出及滙兌統制辦法、顯在剝奪美國工業所需之中國原料、同時不使美貨進入華北之市塲、且就日人在華北之積種行動而觀、日人之目的、顯欲驅除美國在華北之商業、漢口美國商會對於日人侵犯在華美人權益之處、亦大表不滿、尤其對於日人限制外人船隻、及外國僑民在揚子江之行動、更為憤慨、漢口美僑所呈騐之通行證、日方每每不予承認、任何第三國僑民、皆須向日方領取通行證、同時據漢口美國商會報吿、自日軍佔領漢口之一個月中、日船抵漢口者已有三千艘之多、美國及共他外國商業、多受日方種種刁難、但日本貨物、則在漢口方面儘可自由出售、同時、日方更將中國物產、自由運往日本、最後漢口美國商會亦請美政府對日本採取强硬之報復手段、（十日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（重慶）此間各報對於天津外國商人要求本國政府對日本統制華北貿易採取報復行動之議皆稱道備至、各報皆謂、英美與日本之利益、完全處於矛盾衝突地位、絕無調和之可能、故對於英美至今猶未採取報復手段一事、表示詫異、至於日本目前在華北實施之貿易統制與滙兌統制、目的顯在加緊其對於英美等國之經濟戰爭、故英美若欲保護其在華利益、除在經濟上對華作更多之援助外、尤須對日本採取報復之行動、中國陸軍機關報掃蕩報今日著論、對於美國前國務卿史汀生致紐約時報函、備致稱道、該報稱、史氏雖為共和黨領袖、但對於羅斯福總統中與英法合作以與獨裁國對抗之主張、不僅竭力贊助、且進而主張英法一旦遭受攻擊之後、美國更應與英法謀海軍之合作、此種就事論事、不偏不倚之精神、實由於史氏之眼光遠大興胸襟恢廓、同時更因史氏對於和平之不可區分性、具有充分之認識、總之、史氏之言論、可謂對於美國孤立派之當頭一棒、（九日美聯電）</p>
<p>（北平）本月十一日起、華北全境廢止法幣之計畫、巳臨時發生變化、據「臨時政府」本日宣佈、自三月十一日起、華北在貨幣流通方面、將分為兩個區域、卽「聯合準備區」、與「匪區」所謂「聯合準備區」者、以冀魯豫三省之十一個城市為限、平·津·靑島·及烟台等處、皆不在內、此區人民、在三月十一日以後、如發見携帶法幣、即將處罰、並沒收其財產、此項命令又稱、「聯合準備銀行」紙幣之流通、將隨日軍佔據之擴張、而推行於其他地方云、（九日路透社電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）金融時報社論謂、星期三日英國會中甫宣布中國滙兌平準基金借款成立、同時華北復有日本貨幣計畫之發展、兩事相繼而來、其巧合大可注意、此項借款、無疑的有益於商業、但所期望於英國納稅人與官塲者、勿僅於担保財政而中止、英國在此方面之政策、亦巳大有發展、此乃觀於出口信用借款之擴張而可證明者、（十日路透電）</p>

<h3>英助中國金融　日本無可奈何　國內通貨曾任趨膨脹猶冀英國改變方針</h3>
<p>（東京）日藏相石渡邊太郎昨午在下院預算委員會中宣稱、日本在某種限度以內、巳難免通貨膨脹、但此事並不足憂慮、政界人士解釋此項聲明、認為因對華戰事之結果·日元購買力，已經减低、現來京政府積極以限制方法、防止貨幣之貶値云、（十日海通電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省發言人今日在招待外籟新聞記者席上批評英國對華金融借款、調無康重視、英財相西門旣調、中國幣制之穩定、乃英國對華經濟政策中之要素、可為英人在華經商者之大助、則英政府應以各種方法、把握東亞事件之一般趨勢、放棄其援助中國法幣政策、援助新幣、以促其穩定、則將見舊幣轉為新幣、毫不困難、希望英國目光遠大之政治家、不久將覺悟其政策之錯誤云、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）朝日新聞載稱、英國駐日大使克萊琪昨向外相有田說明英國對華新借款後、日外務省即召集會議、商討對策、决定有警吿英國之必要、又决定審愼硏究日本方面之反動情形、該報續稱、吾人可謂英國設法維持中國法幣、不　巳加入中國之經濟游擊戰、日本未必無對抗之辦法、例如長江航行問題之解决、將因而展緩是也、日本各報皆刋載當局授意之批評、對於此項新貨幣借款、大半皆强烈抨擊、報知新聞亦稱、日內閣曾於星期四晚在國會大厦召集緊急會議、討論政府對此項新偕款之態度、聞內閣巳决定、對於此項不友好之行勸、應提出强硬抗議、並採行抵制中英新恊定之積極對策、如英國繼續此種不友好行動、日本應對於英國在華之權益、採取報復行動云、（九日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）英國又以巨款借於中國、引起日本全國極度憤慨、政界人士成批測日本政府是否將向倫敦提出抗議、據日本外務省發言人今晨宣稱、英國駐日大使克萊琪爵士、己將此項借款之性質及若干細目、正式通知日外務次官澤田、聲明英國為保護在華利益起見、不能不貸款中國、以保持中國貨幣之穩定、澤田當即代表日政府表示抗議、據發言人稱、英國此種態度、完全不顧及遠東方面之最近發展、一味欲維持現狀云、（十日海通電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）日本外相有田、前於本月六日、在該國衆議院發出聲明之後、（其內容略謂、「中國事件」乃係共產國際所發動、日本雖以全力應付共產國際、並非全能國家、共對於英美法三國無須採取敵對態度）、倫教泰晤士報駐東京訪員、頃來電加以闡說云、「此項聲明、隱然表示日本雖加入反共產國際公約、但不因其他各簽字國即德義兩國之故、而危及日本與英美法三國之關係、緣此項公約雖可使日本政策、在某某點獲有便利、但在其他各點、仍須取得各民治國之贊可、至少須取獲各該國之諒解、始能有所作為、凖是而論、日本旣非無條件的加入反民治集團、則反共產國際公約各簽字國進一步而密切合作之計劃不論來自何方均當為日本當局所拒絕」云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）財相西鬥爵士昨日在下議院宣布、以余融借款貸予中國之後、約克廈郵報（夙以前外相艾登機關報著稱）頃加以評論云、「英國政府决定帮助中國設立一千萬鎊匯兌平準基金、此舉無異對於日本之當頭一棒、此項談判進行已非一日、調其意在對付日本、成份尙少、而主要目標、乃在充實中國之金融基礎、以發展中英兩國貿易、緣中國當局若不能控制法幣、則其貿易將受惡劣影響、英國政府前此旣以信用放款（為數共五十萬鎊）畀予中國、茲又助成滙兌平準基金之設立、自此、英國對於保護並發展共對華貿易之政策、常能切實推進、」曼哲斯德保衛報載稱、「此項金融借款、業由日本方面加以批評、稱之為一種政治舉動、吾人姑不具論、但此舉之具有重大意義、且必發生宏遠影響、亦屬實在情形、質言之、金融借款足以保持中國經濟健全、因是而日本無法具備此項制服中國之主耍條件、準是而論、此舉所可引起之影響、實有政治性質、是屬無可諱言、此在英國視之、原係義不容辭、蓋英國當局、若因日本方面疑懼此種政治的影響之將不利於該國、乃顧忌而不以切實辦法、援助中國金融、亦即英國因欲顧忌日本之有所疑懼、遂放棄其保護對華貿易之職責、是則必無之理云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>倫敦人士觀察　歐漩時局已好轉　義國對法亦不致苛求限制軍備將舊事重提</h3>
<p>（倫敦）此間負責人士頃宜稱、兩月以來、國際時局巳見好轉、一俟西班牙內戰結束、法義兩國爭端和平解决、關係各國即可進一步討論軍備限制問題、聞張伯倫首相前於本年一月開聘問義國時、義相墨索里尼曾云、西班牙問題與法義兩國爭端一日不能解决、則國際時局即一日不能綏靖、茲者、西班牙內戰即可結束、法義之爭亦必能和平解决、義國各報以及不負責任者所提出之各項要求、殊不必過分重視、大抵法義兩國他日進行談判時、其所討論之主要問題、不外下開三項、（一）東菲洲法屬直布底港問題（二）直布底港通往阿第斯亞貝巴城鐵路問題、（三）北菲洲法屬都尼西亞義國僑民法理地位問題、義國政府所擬提出之要求、內容如何、此時雖無所聞、預料該國必多所需索、以為討價還價餘地、最後定能覔得一折衷方案、則有可斷言、一俟西班牙問題與法義两國爭端相繼解决之後、各國自可談判軍備限制問題、即使祇能成立範圍狹小之軍縮協定、其對於恢復信心、振興世界貿、均可大有裨益、至於德國各報边日所戴文字、雖仍抨擊民治國，該國宣傳部長郭培爾日前在萊潑齊城市集所發表之演說、雖亦咄咄逼人、顧其用意、祇在對內宣傳、正不必過於重視、或調、德國各要人多有反英傾向、亦覺言過其實、例如該國勞工陣綫領袖拿樂伯、雖屬國社黨急進派要人、但渠與張伯倫首相會晤時、亦會懇切表示、謂對於英國具有同情與誠意、加之海外貿易大臣赫德遜即當前往柏林、與德國政府當局進行經濟談判、此行性質亦復十分重要、而以英德兩方最近所進行之非正式接恰言之、經濟談判、前途實有可樂觀、此蓋緩和時局之又一因素也、（九日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）英國負責人士日昨發表言論、謂兩月以來、國際時局巳見好轉、前途較可樂觀云、德國政界人士聞悉之後、頃加以評論、表示懷疑、並謂、「英美兩國對於各全能國一日不能在精神上解除武裝」、事實上即一日不必以軍縮為言、亟所先務、英美兩國應首先勸吿蘇聯减縮軍備、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>一千萬鎊借欵成功後　設運用委員會　指定用途為穩定法幣價值由四行分認該款存在英國</h3>
<p>我國政府為維持法幣信用、穩定外滙、以利商業交易、使滙兌有合理之穩固、向英商匯豐·麥加利·及中國·交通·等四銀行、成立借款一千萬英鎊、充作匯兌平準基金、並設立資金運用委員會、茲詰詳情如下、</p>

<p>設委員會　决定設立是項借款之資金運用委員會、滙豐·麥加利·中國·交通·四銀行、各派代表一人為委員、並由我國政府財政部及英國政府財部各派代表一人為委員、聞總會設在英國倫敦、並在香港設立辦事處、該委員會俟各行及政府代表推定後、即行宣告成立、</p>
<h3>濬浦局被扣船隻　發還交涉　據聞雙方接近不久可得結論</h3>
<p>上海濬浦總局、自各種挖泥船、測量船、以暨接客小輪等、大小二十餘艘、全部被日方</p>
<p>强制拖去　後、迄今已歷時年餘、尙未發還、而浦江內各段、以暨吳淞江下段、及吳淞口外神灘等浚工、均停頓進行、淤泥淤沙、逐波漂流、故往日浚挖區域、前工亦巳盡廢、而其漲積程度、且較未浚前爲甚、殊足爲航行之患、至被扣船隻、現</p>
<p>除建設號　挖泥船被扣後、尙繫泊於楊樹浦江面外、其餘各船、均被强行徵調使用、如高橋等處、且派日僞（滿）人員、進行浚挖、喧賓奪主、極爲各外商輪公司所不滿、因濬浦局之性質、屬於國際性、其造船及一應經費、均由海關向各外輪帶徵濬浦捐而得、浚工一旦停止、航路</p>
<p>勢必窒礙　第三國航商之權益、遂爲受害也、緣是海關總稅務司署、及江海關稅務司、一再向日方交涉發還被扣船隻、回復浚工、惟並無效果、其癥結所在、則日方亦以海關之引用日員爲例、而以濬消局須添用日員爲條件、此事極爲局方所不能接受、但現在所聞據稱交涉重叉進行、且較以前接近、大致不久、可得一結論、</p>

<h3>一九三九年度　工部局預算書　收去不敷二百餘萬特別開支超過上年　—加捐後半年內可得百餘萬—</h3>
<p>工部局之本年度總預算、連同該局財務處長之意見書、業經財務委員會於本月三日開會時審核完竣、據預算書草案所載、各項經常收入、共計二七·二四六·七五〇元、其中二·二七二·三七〇元經劃入敎育費預算、其餘因各項捐稅估計、可多收三三五·四五〇元、除去敎育費可凈餘二五·三〇九·八三〇元、各項經常開支（敎育費不算在內）預算初步草案中、共開二八·九〇一·二三七元、在各委員會考量預算以前、此數經减至二八·八二七·四五〇元、旋因各處處長會商之結果、再减二九〇·七七〇元、買賣洋米賬目上海之盈餘二八〇·〇〇〇元、復經劃爲救濟難民之經費、於是各項支出、除敎育費外、共需二八·二五六·六八〇元、以上所開收支相抵、凈虧二·九四六·八五〇元、爲彌補此項虧空起見、財務處長會建議自本年七月一日起、將市政總捐及特別市政捐各加百分之二、地稅亦自同日起以同樣之比例增加、所增捐稅、可於半年以內加收約一·二五〇·〇〇〇元、至預算中仍有不敷之數、可移入下年度預算、或用其他方法彌補、財務處長云、本局所給捐款及補助費數額、在編訂預算時、尙未决定、討論職員薪津問題委員會所提建議之效果、未曾計及、由於此兩層原因、預算尙有再行調整之必要、該處長又云、關於外幣滙價之計算、以國幣一元、合英金八辨士半之比率爲根據、至於各處之特別開支、初步草案、共開二·五四七·六三〇元、其中有若干項開支、因各委員會討論草案時、認爲非屬必耍將其剔除、但有一種補充預算代替之、所剔除之開支、共計七五五·六〇〇元、補充預算內共開三二·五〇〇元、於是特別開支總額爲一·八二四·五三〇元、比h年度超出三四七、二六〇元、財務處長謂、關於特別支出預算之平衡、在相當期間內、另有報告、</p>
<p>本年度適用之捐稅表、亦經財務委員會於本月三日考量、該委員會之建議如下、（一）地稅、自本年一月一日起、至六月三十日止、公共租界內之土地、依照估價按千分之八收稅、自本年七月一日起、至下屆納稅人年會時止、稅率改爲千分之九、此項地稅、由租地人每半年預繳一次、（二）市政總捐、凡公共租界內之房屋、各按所估之租金數額、自本年四月一日起至六月三十日止收捐百分之十六、自七月一日起至下屆納稅人年會時止、收捐百分之十八、此項房捐、由住戶每季預繳一次、（三）特別捐、凡公共租界以外之房屋而其住戶享受租界各種設施、與公用事業之便利者、各按所估之租金數額、自本年四月一日起、至六月三十日止、收捐百分之十四、自七月一日起至下屆納稅人年會時止、收捐百分之十六、由住戶每季預繳一次、本月八日、工部局董事會議决、准如財務委員會所擬、通過上開經常費預算及捐稅表、但加捐一節、改自十月一日起實行、工部局財務處長會報告該局之一一九三八年度賬目、正在審核一中、撮要言之、各項收入（未劃開敎育費以前）實計二四·七四二·四〇三元、比預算收入增加二·五四二·七二三元、各項支出、總計二六·六〇二·六四七元、比預算超出一·七六〇·〇二七元、兩者相抵、凈虧一·八六〇·二四四元、比預算不敷之數、减少七八二·六九六元、據財務處長說明、收入增加之主要原因、在東北兩區之收捐成績、比預算者爲佳、而蘇州河以南之空屋、比預料者爲少、且領有執照之各種事業、均見擴展、茲將各項收入之預算額與實收額之差數分列如下、地稅（比預算多收下同）一〇七·四〇七元、市政總捐一·二二二·一一九元、特別捐一七九·八六二元、執照費三九五·八八一元、公用及市政事業收入、三三八·九七九兀、其他收入二八〇·七五九元、敎育費雜項收入一七·七一六元、至於各處之開支、除捐款、補助費及工務處費用外、均比預算超出頗多、其生要原因、爲去年下半年之滙價猛跌、（上年編訂預算時之滙價爲一先令二又八分之三辨士）試觀養老金·退職儲金·及其他退職金之滙兌津貼、幾佔普通類所加支出一·一〇九·二三八元之全部、可見滙價高漲之影響矣、</p>
<h3>調華日軍　一萬餘名反戰　破壞武器拒絕登陸在塘沽被押回本國</h3>
<p>據由天津來滬客商昨語現代社記者云、二月底會有日本運輸艦三艘、儎裝日軍約一萬餘人、由大連出發、駛至塘沽口岸停靠時、詎艦上日軍、均不願登岸、且將携帶之武器、有所破壞、秩序混亂不堪、雖經日軍高級長官壓制、而該日軍皆不聽命令、自由行動、並齊呼反戰口號、迨後附近日艦聞訊趕到彈壓、仍將該三艦日軍、監視押回本國、據該客商云、渠當時曾在塘沽辦貨、目擊此事、地方人民恐慌、家家關門、但華北各地報紙、均屬日偽主辦、故對此項不利消息、無隻字登載、並禁止人民談論、又駐防在華北各區之日軍、厭戰自殺事件、亦時有所聞、</p>
<h3>工部局加捐事　華人表示悲歎　增捐收入僅敷加薪之用市面繁盛公衆未蒙其惠</h3>
<p>大陸報云、工部局之决議、將稅率自百分之十六增至十八、公共租界納稅人對此不致作有組織之反抗、記者昨日（九日）廣事調査、得悉大部份納稅人雖不贊成增稅之舉、但亦無將作反對之表示、公共租界外僑對此消息多少</p>
<p>不予重視　、惟公共租界受影響最大之納稅華人、則對增稅加以悲歎、而蘇州河北岸之日僑、亦嚴厲抨擊此項决議、但確知華人納稅會將不取與增稅作爭論之任何行動、據該會發言人聲稱、工部局之求收支相抵、已覺困難、故華人居民不欲使局方更感棘手、惟納稅華人復提及工部局高級職員增薪事、堅稱局方之必須增税、其</p>
<p>高級職員　應負一部份責任、蓋此次增稅、工部局收入年增一百二十五萬元、而高級職員加薪後、局方支出年增一百萬元、故稅率之增加不啻乃飽加薪僱員之私囊、復據華人各界批評云、工部局必因相信上海商業繁盛商店所增之收入、當能抵銷增稅而出此、然局方未知所謂繁盛者、公衆未受其惠、尤以爲大多數納稅華人爲甚、獲利者僅鉅商與產業主而已、</p>
<h3>荳米業　開管理會　切勸勿屯積居奇並盼望販商復運</h3>
<p>本市食糧問題、自產區米糧、被日僞他運、來滬减少、致價格步漲、影響民食、荳米業公會業經决議嚴格執行限價、不得逾越、該會因大戶吸進之風尙盛、殊足影響民食前途、爰於昨日上午九時、復續開市塲管理委員會、由符前耕主席、當經决議、剴切勸導、各荳米行號共體時艱、勿屯積、勿居奇、勿操縱、一致實行公會維持十四元限價之决議、並盼販商向產地照常採辦復運、以裕民食來源、</p>
<h3>甬同鄉會决定　購辦洋米　總數共十萬石電部請給外滙</h3>
<p>寗波旅滬同鄕會、擬在滬採辦食米赴甬、以備春荒、卒因上海江海關禁米出口、致無結果、頃據大通社記者探悉、甬同鄉會、現已去函寗波商會、徵求聯名向財政部請給外滙、辦購洋米十萬石、一待寗波商會同意、即聯名向財部請求、以濟民食、</p>
<h3>虹口區域　發生新恐怖事件　恐怖份子改變作風夜闌人靜到處縱火</h3>
<p>租界區內之「恐怖」事件、經工部局之努力、現已歛迹、惟虹口區域滬東一帶、新「恐怖」事件又趨活躍、近日楊樹浦區內恐怖份子散佈街道尾巷、甚或匿跡空屋內、每於夜靜更深、彼輩乘人熟睡之際、潛出縱火、幾每夜有之、此種所謂「恐怖」事件、發生於日方治區內、使日方感於防止爲難、</p>

<h3>華北禁用法幣　金融市場無損　滙兌暢通均以法幣互滙各行均拒絕收受「聯券」</h3>
<p>自華北僞政府於今日起禁止法幣行使後、因人民深信法幣樂於收藏、華北法弊發行、有增無减、上海各行、早已綢繆充分準備、金融市場不受影響、滙兌暢通、均以法幣互滙、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>推銷聯券禁用法幣　偽華北「聯合準備銀行」發行鈔票、企圖掉換法弊、套取外滙失敗後、强迫華北地方法幣貶值、並由僞「華北政府」令於三月十一日起、禁止法幣流通、皆在推銷其「聯券」發行、並規定「聯券地帶」及「戰區地帶」兩區、「聯券地帶」爲北平·天津·青島·濟南·太原·烟台·山海關·石家莊·唐山·臨汾·新鄕·等地、禁用法幣、强迫行使「聯券」、「戰區地帶」即遊擊隊控制之處、日僞兵力所不能達到、則法幣仍舊通用、無法禁止、</p>
<p>人民收藏需要增加　法幣之在華北流通、雖經日僞一再設法破壞、如强行貶值、禁止行使等、但因法幣準備充足、華北人民、樂於收藏、對於僞鈔、則隨收隨付、於是造成華北天津等處、不特不按照折扣行使、反有千元加水二十元至三十元、則證明法幣價值、在「聯券」以上、華北法幣發行、有增無减、今年二月十八日截止、中國爲一六二·二·二三三·一〇〇元、交通爲七八·五〇〇·〇〇·元、中央爲三六·五·五·九〇五元、中南·中實·農工·墾業·浙興·等行、爲四·八六〇·〇〇〇元、</p>
<p>上海金融不受影響　新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、華北禁止法幣流通、與上海金融市塲、絕對不受任何影響、蓋上海各銀行、早已未雨綢繆、有充分之準備故也、華北天津之租界內及游擊區域、以後法幣、仍照常流通、一切收付、均爲法幣、故僞「華北政府」之禁止法幣流通、於事實上並無所補、各銀行與華北各地之滙兌、依然暢通、仍以法幣互滙、上海各銀行對於「聯券」、一律拒絕收受、惟華北·北平·等地華商銀行、受日僞之壓迫、營業銳减、</p>
<p>十足行使毫無疑慮　縱使三月十一日以後、我天津中交各行發行之法幣、被强制在淪陷地帶停止流通、然而在北平使館界內·天津租界地內·以及內地鄉村之中、因對外滙價格穩定如故、民衆信心、日益加强、必能十足行使、毫無疑慮、况凡國際商業之收支、農工產品之買賣、莫不以我法幣爲收付之工具、此次一千萬英鎊借款成功、法幣價值、愈趨穩定鞏固、中外人士之對於我國法幣、益加增强信仰、所以金融界對於華北之禁用法幣、並不重視、</p>
<h3>上海工人　失業統計　總數約三十萬各地人士均有</h3>
<p>上海泰晤報云、昨（九日）悉、據日內瓦國際勞工局中國科所作之統計、上海目前有失業男女工人三十萬人、任何大都市中、失業乃屬常事、但一九三七年滬戰爆發前、上海即被稱爲「失業者之殖民地」、上海有白俄移民、共數因有白俄新自哈爾濱抵滬而增加、虹口區復有日人、其</p>
<p>失業人數　亦高、此外又有前在上海租界四周工作之無數失業華人、近更有數千不幸之歐洲猶太人偕眷屬而至、故各種國籍之失業者人數、復見增多、南市雞民區中亦容有難民數千人、而退出漢口·廣州·等地之華人、聞前往上海者頗多、其中若干勾留滬上、餘者因見難以謀生、且滬上</p>
<p>生活程度　頗高、乃立刻赴他處謀生、此種局勢、達於焦點、而中外商店復從事大規模節省開支、必有多人因以失業、一般人雖均承認時勢不佳、但去年歲慕、聞當地商業與貿易局勢、尙差强人意、許多重要百貨商店獲利頗豐、聞其中一二家盈餘達六百萬元之鉅、多數華方銀行與錢莊</p>
<p>亦獲厚利　、中國商店雖有少數自動淸理、然罕有被迫閉歇者、惟上海消息靈通之商界、預料當地商業局勢、非經悠久時期、不能恢復戰前地位、一九三七年之失業男女工人八十萬人、其中約五十萬人巳在公共租界邇來開設之華商工廠中覓得工作、若此失業人數减少之統計、確符事實則本埠工業地位、似已較前爲佳矣、</p>
<h3>外輪裝運米糧　日方拒絕簽證　長江航運由內河公司獨覇白茆楊林等港口將行封鎖</h3>
<p>關於日方統制長江航業、排擠外商權益、已積極進行、漸臻具體化、原有行駛各口之外輪、則極盡留難、且拒絕發給採辦證、據悉瀏河·七丫口·滸浦·常陰沙·等港口、將歸日清公司所變相組織之內河公司派輪航行、其他各口、進行封鎖、茲經現代社記者探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>外輪裝貨拒絕簽證　日方對外輪在長江錢航運、非常仇視、利用特殊暴力、在各港口任意檢査旅客貨物等情、致外輸營業、蒙受重大影響、詎日方又於三月份起、實行貨物進出採辦證、極盡留難手段、本埠英商怡和公司之同和輸、於上星期開往滸浦、裝運米糧來滬、而日方竟拒絕簽發採辦證、故該輪迄今、仍停泊口外、正與該處駐軍交涉中、其他如德商禮和洋行之江定輪·謙信洋行之凱司登輪·長豐洋行之新江南·亦准祇搭客及少數貨物、但不准裝運米糧棉花等、此外又行駛常陰沙·滸浦·等口岸之怡太公司亞力山大輪、亦不准裝運貨物、</p>
<p>內河公司繼起代航　關於今後長江下游航運、將歸日淸公司附屬組織之江浙內河輪船公司派輪行駛、本月初、會有該公司日人淺野、赴長江南岸各港口、訪問常（熟）·太（倉）·江（陰）·警備司令高橋後、即與各該縣僞組織方面進行磋商航行辦法、預計於本月內、當可實現、叉悉內河航輪（行駛蘇州河一帶）亦經該公司佈置就緒、在崑山設立轉運總站、嗣後外商小輸、將一律遭該公司之排擠、聞外商方面、决一致力爭、以保在華利益、</p>
<p>江南各港口將封鎖　據現代記者向航業界方面探悉、日方對長江南岸各港口、如寶山縣屬之小川沙·太倉縣屬之楊林·蕩棲·常熟縣屬之白茆·福山·等港、將施行封鎖、將來開放瀏河·七丫口·滸浦·常陰沙·等四港口、</p>
<h3>日方單獨恢復　長江下游航業　日商輪塗黑烟囱冒育運輪艦行駛</h3>
<p>長江外商輸船公司航業權、自日方藉口進行軍事、强制對鎖以來、迄今未能恢復、迭經提出强硬交涉、仍無結果、致各公司所受損失棊重、茲悉日方業巳獨自恢復江陰以上直至漢口之航錢、派輪往返載客運貨、業務頗形發達、各淸分紀如次、</p>
<p>先復江陰班　長江江面、日方於去歲先行單獨恢復上海至江陰之綫、派有日輪海門丸一艘、往來行駛、烟囱則被塗黑、表面上充作運輸艦、每四日往返一次、即上海每隔四日開出一班、停泊滬東威賽公碼頭、每班來去、以乘客居多、貨物較少、</p>
<p>再復武漢班　武漢開放後、日方近又進一步獨自開航滬漢航班、派出六智丸·鳴門丸·兩輪、（均屬大阪公司所有）漆黑烟囱、外表仍似運輪艦、實際客貨一律裝運、兼靠鎭江·南京·蕪湖·大通·安慶·九江•武穴·黃石港·等各埠、亦以乘客居多、因內地交通未復、貨物甚少、上海停靠滬東大阪碼頭、大約每七日開出一班、（有數處江面、晚間不能通行、故每輪往返須十四天）、</p>

<p>烚赤風浪滔天再跌二十三元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開即聞外滙鬆硬、故進者大多觀望、賣價遂由二千一百元喊低至九十元方見做開、首由某現金號售予金號及證券帮各五十兩、價二千〇九十元爲開盤行情、較之前收做低八元、開後因進者更缺、故跌勢頗厲、現金號又售予錢兌業五十兩、價八十元、銀樓帮售予錢兌業五十兩六十八元、其時證券帮續來吸購、遂稍回高、證券帮力進百兩、價六十八元及七十五元、（均由某銀樓洪售）、未幾證券帮忽止進力售、賣予錢兌業五十兩價七十五元、其間聞外滙鬆勢加厲、進者叉審愼觀望、且證券帮不惜賤價復吐、故跌風復厲、證券帮賣予錢兌業五十兩、價六十五元、又售予錢兌業五十兩、竟跌至四十五元、繼之某銀號亦售予錢兌業五十兩、四十四元爲最低價、此後聞外滙止鬆轉緊、故遂引起買風、價亦復向上升、錢兌業　本地帮吸購同業百兩五十元、（出者乃前所吸進獲利了結、）後某銀號又吐予金號五十兩、價四十七元、銀樓帮進錢兌業二十兩、價九十元、錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩價五十五元、銀樓帮互做五十兩、價一躍至六十五元、繼之又互做五十兩、六十三元、時已午刻、午後首由錢兌業互做五十兩、價六十元、後證券帮又來拋塞、續向下降證券帮賣予銀摟帮五十兩爲五十元、其時外滙復趨軟化、且某錢兌業忽興買風、致乃重復上升、進證券帮五十兩價五十四元、此後證券帮止售、因之漲風又厲、直抬高至七十元關外、金號進錢兌業五十兩價七十四元、某錢兌業進二百兩、價均七十五元、（乃由證券帮暨銀樓帮及同業供給）、此後另一錢兌業稍有頭寸拋塞、但進者又呈旁觀、然價雖喊低至七十二元、但仍難獲對手、致未做開、故晚收價仍作二千〇七十五元、結果較上日軋跌二十三元、（已揮跌五天共計一百十五元）、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇八十五元、收進二千〇七十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、亦均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金變動五次終亦掛小三元</p>
<p>銀摟首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至九時五十二分、因烚赤初開即疲、故亦掛小一元、十時〇五分烚赤亦續趨軟、故又掛小二元、後至十時五十五分、烚赤潛勢愈疲、故再掛小二元、正午十二時因烚赤稍有回漲、故亦回高一元、午後三時五十五分因烚赤繼續回升、故亦隨之冉回高一元、結果較上日軋跌三元、大同行老慶雲等改懸二百十元、新同行爲二百〇八元、收進二百〇二元、</p>

<h3>中英匯兌基金借款</h3>
<p>— 盛慕傑</p>
<p>（一）　由貨物借款到貨幣借款　一九三八年十二月中，美國進出口銀行貸予中國信用放款二千五百萬元美金，當時筆者曾對該項貸款的經濟意味，加以綸述，說明它是貨物貸款，並推論英國對於中國放款必會實現。果然在去年十二月十五日出口信用據保法修正之後，即以五十萬鎊貸予中國，同時並規定於去年底，再將商業信用放款數批，貸給中國，用以購買火車和軍火以外各項貨物，去發展西南各省的經濟建設。常時英國方面與論，會謂中國的需要甚大，若此五十萬區區之數，按中國人口平均分配，每人衹可獲得一Farthing—等於一便士的四分之一，於事實上實無所裨益；加之英國政府旣未能聽任中國舉辦借軟，且對此區區之數，復指定作爲購進載重汽車與運輸材料底用途，實在美中不足。中國雖與美國成立二千五百萬美金信用借款之時，得此五十萬鎊，並不嫌不足，僅希望英國在財政金融上，能再作强有力的援助，故自去年到現在爲時不過三個月，中英又成立五百萬鎊的貨幣借款了。</p>
<p>（二）　中英貨幣借款底成立</p>
<p>此次中英貨幣借款成立，據英財相西門三月八日在下議院所宣稱，乃是對中國外滙平準基金的貸款，用以鞏固中國的法幣制度，我們就西門氏答覆議員勞倫斯請其發表援助中國維持法幣眞正價值的穩固底言詞中，不難分析此决借款的內容和性質以及運用等情如下：</p>
<p>名稱　中國外滙平準基金貸款；</p>
<p>數額　英國擄任五百萬鎊；</p>
<p>用途　鞏固法幣；</p>
<p>承貸銀行　匯豐銀行及麥加利銀行；</p>
<p>擔保　此項基金於結束時，如受有損失，英財部保證賠償，如獲有利潤，則移交英財部：</p>
<p>期限　運用期以十二個月爲限，期滿得延長，必要時得提早結束。</p>
<p>英國貸款中國底計議，去年七月會經內閣考慮，當時因未有充分理由，未予通過，且恐歐洲危局正在進展的時候，不便在遠東採行積極計劃。但是日人在華北壓斷商業，藉口軍事禁止長江珠江通航，組織日圓集團，排斥外人在華利益，並且不惜向英國挑　，轟炸九龍，占據海南，威脅香港，使得英國不得不以必耍的措置來維護在中國的利益。故在事實上，英國一方面以信用放飲貸予中國去講買英國貨物，一方面另以款項貸予中國，帮助它維持法幣制度。現在西班牙問題結束在即，英國對於遠東問題，乃能集中注意力，在經濟上去對抗日本。那末此次貨幣貸款無疑的是一種外交上的姿勢，不啻警告日本說，英國雖不想用戰爭來維持中國門戶的開放，但决不容它在中國的利益因缺乏實際的援助而消滅。在這一個原因下，最近中英五百萬鎊貨幣借軟所以成立了。</p>
<p>（三）　新中國的戰時金融政策</p>
<p>就前文對於此項中英借款的分析，可以知道這是中國在戰時金融政策中最新的一種。根據英財相西門氏所透露的消息，謂中國政府會通知英國政府擬賡續現行的貨幣政策，且於法幣準備金之外，另　穩固法幣的滙兌平準基金一千萬鎊，以爲此項政策之一部份。很顯然的此項外滙平準基金政策乃是中國一種新的余融政策了。按中國在一九三四年十月施行白銀輸出平衡税制度之後，復爲安定滙兌計，會由中央中國交通三政府銀行籌足基金一萬萬元，交外滙平市委員會運用，不過現在更加强這一個政策的運用，當然是屬於戰時的一種新金融政策了。</p>
<p>中國現行的貨幣政策，單就法幣滙價維持的觀點上講，不外是外滙的統制和金銀的收集及金砂的開採。但是在目前要把收集金銀，採煉金砂，當作解决外滙問題的唯一辦法，實在緩不濟急。現在法幣的法定滙價，中國當然有雄厚的力量去維持，事實上戰事經過快二十個月，法幣的法定滙價始終穩定，但垷行外滙統制辦法不是說是澈底的妥當的而無流弊的（參照財孔在重慶中國經濟學社第十四屆年會演講詞）。所以現在更從滙兌平準基金上設想，以求法幣制度底愈形鞏固。英國政府在中日戰事發生之前會派經濟顧問李滋羅斯極力襄助中國穩定貨幣，樹立法幣制度，難道在中日戰爭之後，對與英國財政經濟最關重要底穩固法幣的事反漠不相關？中國現旣盡最大的努力去賡續現行貨幣政策，施行一種新的金融政策設立滙兌平準基金以求法幣的穩固，則與英國在中國的貿易有極大的關係，英國自樂於借款以助此新政策之成功。　（未完）</p>

<p>滬埠外棉交易、印棉因售出過巨、運往遠東軍火甚擠、華印間水脚可派爲運棉者有限、因之印碼頭倉庫滿置印棉、而滬上各廠皆因需要而購棉、早已作額抵用、茲因印棉未能尅日運來、均深以爲慮、恐原棉中斷也、對講辦印棉暫抱觀望、故外棉交易轉靜、昨日新裕進美棉一千包、價七十五元半、餘廠均無交易聞、茲將昨日棉價分列於後、</p>
<p>本棉生意依然淸淡、蓋以貨物太稀、價格難鬆、又以外棉換算價廉、而匯票放長不已、廠方當然捨貴取廉、因之外棉生意熱閙異常、本棉交易寥寥無幾、碼頭上到下沙花一百八十包、姚花亦到一千零八十包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>

<p>現紗晨初生意不動、人心雖看漲、然手中揑好之貨、俟價高起而獲利出籠也、故開價二十支變馬紗爲三百九十九元、跌一元半、此後無大高低、中途稍昂、未幾即回、最低爲三百九十八元、棧單三百九十六元、午後因天雨、交易尤帶、二十支雙馬三百九十八元不易賣出、棧單價為三百九十五元、結果全日成交僅八百〇五包、行情二十支變馬天女均其餘十支粗紗及三二支·四二舉動、今日有紗二百五十五件運天津、四十二件運烟台、又昨由天津來紗二千五百件、茲將各帮口買去額量錄左、</p>

<h3>維持風紀</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>正不知有多少喪心病在之徒，行同鬼蜮，籍着兵荒馬亂的機會，作出了傷天害理的事情！在不久之前，我們看見了湖匪父子二人，殺其母强娶其女的罪案，最近，又看見了某難民收容所主任毆斃難民的罪案。這兩個案子，現在正在審訊中，將來的判决，我們旣不能預斷，也不能有所干預，自有公正的法律在。但我們却不能不因此格外表示我們擁護法律，維持風紀的赤忱。我們願意這兩案的主犯，獲到應得的罪；並且在這國難期間，他們這樣的行爲，更其不可恕，因此，更其願意我們的法官，「加重處治」。</p>
<p>然而這些都是顯著的罪案，法律易於科刑，社會上也易於辨別得淸楚，知其罪有應得。獨有一言之微，法無明文規定，不能說他有罪，一行之細，社會視爲陋習，往往加以容忍，這樣的人，却就得到了法外的逍遙，腐化中的樂地。這是於世道人心，國家民族大有妨碍的，我們也不應該輕輕放過他們。</p>
<p>某律師竟稱贓物為「戰利品」，這是什麼話！也許他的話果然不違法，但他承認敵人掠奪來的東西為「戰利品」，又辯稱向敵人購買此項「戰利品」者，「不成立贓物罪」，試問他自己以及他所代表的當事人，究竟自居於那一國的人民！如果我們人人如該律師那樣的承認，那樣辯稱的理由，而和我們的敵人打交道，我們還用得着什么抗戰，還不是乾脆與之合作就是了！因之，我們也要喊出「維持風紀」的口號，與以聲斥！</p>
<p>江蘇高等法院第二分院院長兼上海第二特區地方法院院長的佈告，「禁止員丁向訴訟當事人需索金錢」，則在「維持風紀」的正面，作了應作的事，那我們就應該謳歌着我們的賢明長官。</p>
<p>「人必自侮而後人侮之，」這這舉國一致，增强抗戰力量的時期，我們固然要擁護我們的國家法律，而我們尤其要維持那法律所不能達到的社會風紀！</p>
<h3>西班牙的難童學校</h3>
<p>— 雲譯</p>
<p>在一個有花園的寺院裏，設立着一個難童學校。裏面有七十個在飢餓下掙扎的孩子在讀着書，這些孩子都是從被轟炸的區域裏逃出來的。有一個女敎師敎着他們。他們沒有一張紙，一枚針，或一枝粉筆。</p>
<p>一個已過兵役期的士兵，就在學校裏服務着，二個受過傷的青年亦在那敎師的指示下自願執敎。他們都像孩子們的大哥哥。有些孩子像許多士兵一樣，已成了殘廢。</p>
<p>敎師沒有懲罰與獎賞的權力，這事情是由孩子們自己組織的幹事團來執行的。</p>
<p>每星期日的下午，醫院派了一個車夫開着汽車來同他們到那邊去洗浴，理髮。這一天他們是異常高興的，常常唱着得意的反法西斯歌曲。</p>
<p>星期一下午，有一個醫生和看護到他們學校裏來給他們詳細地檢騐一次身體。在房間內陳設着大桌子，這裹備着每個孩子的醫藥記載卡片。一個代表整理卡片並給孩子們在走廊下排隊。另一個帮助孩子們脫衣服。醫生一面喊：「牙齒須醫治」「肘節疼痛」等，一面看護就在卡片上記錄下來。另有一個衛生代表在旁邊聽着記下醫生的話去報告孩子們的家長，使家長能適當地看護孩子。</p>
<p>當他們得着一些紙張的時候，他們就寫了些很短簡的文章去貼在走靡的墙上，作爲壁報。作文都是自發的。文字都是用紅墨水寫成，因爲他們沒有別的東西可用。他們一進寺院後，就開始着養兎，養小鷄和園藝等工作。敎師又製出圖來敎女孩子們做衣服，敎男孩子做木工。雖然他們還缺少許多東西，如針，紡車，錘等，但在別處的孩子會接濟他們，會給他們送來鉛筆，紙張，色一粉，工具，布料，皮球和一切爲孩子們所喜歡的東西。</p>
<p>學生們的午餐是由學校供給的。每個孩子每餐可分得一杯可可和一塊麵包。這費用是由醫院裏的職員和傷兵們捐助出來的。（譯自「新羣衆」）</p>
<h3>新寫實文學的產生</h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>在文學上，新寫實主義的作品，是有了新理想主義的作品以後才產生的。原來寫實派的優點，在於赤裸裸的寫得切實，逼眞而透達，合於事理，這才深刻濃厚而感動人的力量强。因爲寫實派以前的浪漫派，由理想而陷於空想，熱情流爲在妄，寬浮乏力，所以給寫實派壓倒了。——浪漫派的態度近於遊戲了，不能滿足一般認眞的讀者的欲望，這才興起了莊重嚴緊的寫實派。由此可見，在深切的探討問題，愼重研究人生的用處上，寫實是比憑理想來得好。只是寫實派，重在事實的再現，固然不免拘束；正當社會混亂得厲害，醜惡的事情太多，需要拿革命的手段來急速改進的時候，只靠寫寶派把固有的壞現象用諷刺的方式暴露出來作爲對於黑暗方面的攻擊，頭痛翳頭，脚痛醫脚，是不足以拯救病態嚴重的全社會的。而且以後的自然主義者，疏忽光明之處，老是着重於黑暗方面的描寫，悲愁的提示太多，未免令人感到沉悶。處在灰暗環境中的讀者本是够沉悶的，再看灰暗的作品，自然更其沉悶，感到無出路而失望。</p>
<p>補救的方法是，注重光明方面的描寫，使人樂觀起來，積極的表現有作有爲的模範人物，再加以鼓勵，使得讀者明白了應該怎樣做以後，就會於無意中自然而然實行做去，籍以根本改造惡劣的環境。這種有作有爲的模範人物，在固有的事實上沒有現成的模型可用，只好由作者虛構起來，這就是新理想主義的特徵。譬如以前，對於寇日的侵略，無情的壓迫，還沒有能够實行抵抗的人物可以用作現成的模型；可是抗戰總得準備，在文學上總得鼓吹抗戰，所以那時的所謂民族主義文學，原是準備抗戰的宣傳品，除利用古代民族英雄的故事藉以激勵以外，只好採用新理想主義的手段來虛構模範人物。由此可見，人物要虛構，在非唯美派的人生文學上，原是不得已的事情；要是有現成的模型可用，不但省事，而且來得切實，也是容易動人的。</p>
<p>現在可好了，正式抗戰一年半多以來，在激烈的民族革命的鬥爭中，許多在前方衝鋒陷陳浴血殺敵的忠勇的將士，都是後方靑年的模範。慷慨激昂，爲國捐軀的先烈們的故事，就是足以鼓勵後生的好題材。更其是在各處奮門的遊擊隊，他們的刻苦耐勞的活動情形，和勝利失敗的各種經過，都很可以給一般的民衆做參考姿料，做他們的表率，激動他們去實行參戰，或者切切實實的準備起來以防敵人的侵犯。這些事實，雖然是已然的；但在未會爲與其事的人，正是求之不得的理想事物。要從理想中採用題材，無非因爲已然的事實上不敷應用；有了這許多有聲有色的事實，何樂而不用呢？</p>
<p>照差這種新事實紀綠起來的就是新寫實的作品；雖然是「再現」的，却和一般新理想主義的作品，同樣有着「表現」的作用。不但可以在我國多數人之間作爲示範的宜傳品，也很可以推廣到各被壓迫的弱小民族間去活用。因爲道種事實，都是團結奮鬥抗强自衛的模範行爲。</p>
<p>所謂新寫實主義的文學，並非寫作的方法來得新穎，而是新在題材的性質上的。而且這新　，並非只是「最近才有」的意思，原是重在抗暴扶弱，共同維護正義人道等條件的。新寫實主義的作品，以前除蘇聯文學以外很少見到，因爲只有在蘇聯的大革命中才多着這種事實。以後我們也可以有許多新寫實的文學了，雖然性質稍有不同，寫實而能示範和鼓動的功用却是一樣的。無論像「鐵流」中的信仰堅定而韌鬥的精神，像「毀滅」和「一週間」中的不怕犧牲的精神，我們都有了，像那「第四十一號」中的主角，我們也已有了。且不說苦戰十年行軍萬里的經過；那八百壯士和廬山孤軍困鬥的事實，以及各戰塲上忠勇將士們的不顧身的壯舉，都可以寫成動人的傑作。</p>
<p>大量的新寫實文學的出現在我國，將要成爲對日抗戰的副產品。</p>

<p>二</p>
<p>一位看謢小姐在前頭領着，一羣小孩子蹦端跳跳嘻嘻哈哈跑進來了，那是附近小學校的孩童歌詠隊。他們每天要來唱幾支歌爲咱們解解氣悶。</p>
<p>唱過三支團體歌，（一）黨歌；（二）給勇士敬禮；（三）中國萬歲。彭小姐照例一手托着藥盤，一手携着那僩呌做吉吉的孩子，走到我們這邊來。</p>
<p>咱說：「吉吉來，給老牛唱支好聽的歌。」</p>
<p>於是吉吉厮熟地跑過來，小身子倚在咱床桿上唱道：</p>
<p>告訴你的母莫悲傷，莫悲傷，</p>
<p>等到我們打勝了，</p>
<p>洋洋得意回故鄉——</p>
<p>「吉吉，你不是會跳舞麽？跳了舞老鄕們纔愛你，替你捉××鬼子，再跳個舞吧，乖乖地。」彭小姐笑着說。</p>
<p>吉吉眞好，他把小黑眼珠一轉，接着提高小嗓子繼續唱道：</p>
<p>「衝過去，…銜過去，莫回頭，莫留戀…」</p>
<p>一面把白胖的小拳頭向前一衝一衝地。咱們都忘了傷痛，顚過身子笑了。彭小姐拍着手說吉吉跳的好呀！咱也說：</p>
<p>「好呀！莫回頭，莫留戀。…」</p>
<p>吉吉却爬在咱床口說：他還會唱支人家唱不來的歌。彭小姐呌他唱，吉吉不肯。咱呌彭小姐在咱衣袋裏掏出個空彈壳子給了他，吉吉的紅臉上纔浮起一個笑靨唱了：</p>
<p>打××，打××，</p>
<p>奪回遼寗，吉林，黑龍江，</p>
<p>把××一個個趕進太平洋。</p>
<p>吉吉，記好，吉林是我們的國土，我們的家鄉</p>
<p>「吉吉，這支歌誰敎你的？」我　來了異樣的感覺似地問。</p>
<p>「爸爸敎的，媽媽要我背熟的。」吉吉說。</p>
<p>「你爸爸做什麽的？」咱挺和氣地抽出好的一隻手拉着吉吉問。</p>
<p>「唔，」意外地，吉吉仰起小頭露出疑難的目光；但他接着就說：「媽媽告訴我爸爸到家裏去了，因爲家裏沒人管，强盜要搶東西的。」還說：「爸爸像老牛，我記得爸爸臉上也有道們一個大疤疤。」</p>
<p>眞的，吉吉頂喜歡弄咱臉上的老彩頭，彭小姐怕碰痛了我的傷，老急得什麼似的。咱說：</p>
<p>「吉吉，咱家裏也有個大囝囝，像你一樣白白胖胖的，他還藏了不少我給他帶回去的彈売子。」</p>
<p>於是吉吉怪親熱地對我說：</p>
<p>「爸也給我留着彈壳呢。打好了矮子你把他帶來比比看，咱們結個小朋友，我也把爸爸呌回來給你做個老朋友。」還叮囑我不要記了。</p>
<p>在老鄉們一陣遮沒呻吟的笑聲裏，彭小姐帶着吉吉去歸隊了。以後吉吉每次來，總得對我提起打好矮子和小牛結朋友的話，又告訴我：他已學會了「托槍」和「槍放下」。雙問小牛會不，可要會嗎？將來一起投軍打矮子，跟大家還可搶得眞的洋槍呢。</p>
<h3>吹泡泡</h3>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>然而過慣了安樂生活的合浦鎭上的民衆，却都不以爲意，兼之圖董楊岳梁又在暗中破壞，說葉團長是有心危詞恫嚇，目的不過想借這題目，向鎭上民衆捐一筆錢，所以民衆也就更不把葉堵長的話放在心上。葉長見言者諄，聽者藐藐，也只有歎息無語。他已把太湖畔所有的船隻都統制了，這時却雇了一艘民船，把食糧和家中一部份用品搬到船上去，常葉老先生問他這是什麼意思時，他慨然的道：</p>
<p>『人無千日好，花無百日紅，我不能說我會永遠保得住這家鄉。倘若形勢危急，爹媽都已上了年紀，吃不了隨軍撤退的苦，只好請你們到太湖裹去暫避一避。太湖裏東西洞庭山和馬蹟山，都有我們的游擊隊伍，到那邊去，小小的照應總會有的。</p>
<p>葉老先生不小大明白外面的情勢，他甚至也覺得葉團長這舉動未免太神經過敏了些。</p>
<p>然而事實却證明葉團長這舉動的料事如神。時間很快的到了廢歷新年，合浦鎭上的民衆，都狂歡節，因為各家商店年底結賬都有盈餘，所以大家自動醵資在鎭上報恩寺裹搭了座堅固的戲臺，請了個走江湖賣藝的戲班子來，連演五天五夜大戲酬神。年初三那天。正當大家都在報恩寺裏挨肩擠背地看戲看得入神的時候，突然，瞭望臺上報告空襲的警鐘，開始「噹噹」的亂嗚起來。</p>
<p>可是，這警報聲，却被各家的年鑼鼓聲，和戲臺上大鑼大鼓聲遮掩住了。葉團長到底比較留心，他一聽見鐘聲，便知道事情不妙，又聽得戲臺上的鑼鼓聲依舊很熱鬧的響着，連忙親自帶了揚聲筒，到報恩寺來疏散民衆。</p>
<p>戲臺上正在演着「白水灘」，十一郞大戰靑面虎，鑼鼓敲得震大價響，臺下的觀衆高聲喝采，全然不知道危險已臨到了頭上。葉團長在人叢中擠了好一會，好容易才擠到臺前，連忙喝呌臺上停鑼，跳上臺來，執着揚聲筒對大家說：</p>
<p>「敵機飛來了！大家趕回家，躱到防空窖裏去。」（三〇）</p>

<h3>從公用事業增價說起</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>希望公用事業當局少採取消極的彌補辦法　希望囤積日用必需品的老闆們能權衡輕重　希望無法維持生活的人儘可能的到內地去</p>
<p>上海的公用事業，近年來似乎是在景氣中度着不景氣；自來水，電力，都相繼的因爲收支不平衡而加價了。電力公司並且還以前所要求增加的百分之三二。五之中緩加的百分之十，於本月份起實行增加，在這一加再加的聲浪中，工部局的市政總捐，地稅等也繼起增加百分之二。</p>
<p>在實際上，各項事業的收入，都因租界人口集中，消費力增强，而較往時爲佳：然而，各項公用事業增價的原因和理由又爲何？總刮的說一句：「外匯緊縮」而已。因爲上海各部門的公用事業都係西人經營，其所用的原料又大多係由外洋運來，其內部所僱用之中上級職員亦多係西人。目前由外洋運來的物料，代價旣高，而其所僱用之西籍職員所得薪金匯回他們的家鄕去，又較平時縮减了若干，當局爲了穩定僱員之生活起見，於是，有「匯兌津貼」及「生活費津貼」之產生，在這種情况下，其本身自然就耍入不敷出，而要增價彌補了。</p>
<p>可是，公用事業增價，不比貨物增價，它所給予社會的影饗，是把整個都市的生活水準提高了，使工商等各部門因爲支出浩大，而不能維持原價。近幾個月來，舶來品的價格固然是漲了不少，國貨也一漲再漲，日用品漲，不是日用品也漲，新近採辦的原料或貨物漲，卽數年前囤積的原料或貨物也漲：再加上操縱，居奇，投機，等等畸形狀態與方式，使除了「漲」之外，還有一個「荒」，一般囤積貨物的老闆們無不笑逐顏開，上年度成爲工商界的豐年，其原因也有一部份在。</p>
<p>不過，我們從一般市民生活的內在情况說來，非必需的高價舶來品，及奢侈品漲價，影響多數市民的生活到並不十分嚴重，因爲非日用所必需的舶來品並不妨碍生活；惟有日用所必需的東西漲價之後，給予市民的壓力，實在是至深且鉅！衣，食，住，三項的服用，在質的方面雖然是有伸縮性，但在量的方面總必須維持到溫飽的程度，束緊了褲帶子度日，那畢竟是笑話。可是，現在粗布的代價却高於從前的細布，蔬菜也較從前增高了不知若干倍，（近來這幾天的米價也高漲了）鷄鴨魚肉，綾羅綢緞之類，以及房租等等，更無論矣。</p>
<p>生活程度旣逐漸高漲，然而一般小市民及薪給階級羣的收入却適得其反，我們所聽到的，東也是「裁員减薪」，西也是「留職停薪」；從前在戰區服務，而現在陷入失業的圈子的人，眞不知凡幾，處在生產與消費背道而馳的狀態下生活着。</p>
<p>近日見報載，我政府刻與匯豐銀行磋商，欲取締上海外匯的黑市塲，我們自然謹冀其成功，而同時，我們也希望公用事業當局少採取消極的彌補辦法，希望一般囤積日用必需品的老闆們權衡輕重，適可而止，不要儘在腦筋中存着一個「多賺些」的歪念，那麽一般的生活就不致於被波動了。</p>
<p>此外，我們也希望一般無法維持最低限度生活的人們，儘可能的到內地去求生活，因爲內地的一切物價都是有規律的，不像上海這樣的漫無限制；祗要抱定服用當地士產的宗旨，總不至於渾渾噩噩，日懼物價高漲了。</p>

<p>（頭目及四嘍囉押旦上，旦哭介，小生衡上，打量旦介，對頭目介，白）呔，大胆的奴才，竟敢强搶民間女子？（頭目背白）我本來要獻給范大王的。誰知道范希周這小子他倒要揩油！好，這便宜就讓他佔了，也算做個人情！（對小生白）我說范大爺，你旣然中了意，就送給你吧。（小生）胡說！還不快快退下！（頭目）喳！正是：枉向刀頭拚性命，花籃提水一塲空。哽！（頭目與嘍囉俱下）（小生）待我親自與她鬆綁！（旦回身向右不理介）小娘子，受驚了！小生這廂有禮！（小生至右揖，旦又回身向左介）小姐，喏喏喏，小生這厢也有禮了！（旦）要殺就殺，不必多言。（小生）小姐，容小生一言奉告。（旦）哪個與你賊子講話！（小生）想小生也非甘心從賊……（旦）哼，方今金人南犯，國家正在危急存亡之秋。你旣非甘心爲寇，就該投降宋邦，同心協力，共禦外侮。花言巧語，誰來信你。我好恨也！（唱）如今國家息外寇，那堪再加內顧憂；爾雖未做金國狗，其實等於助金酋。國家害在爾等手，花言巧語還要胡謅。說什麼並非從賊走，三歲孩童也不上鈎。（小生）小姐哪！小姐息怒，聽我道來！（唱）都只爲，遭飢荒，人民逃散；因此上，我叔父，嘯聚山間。一族人，被脅從，盡都姓范，一心要，脫羅網，難上加難。我也會，將大義，對他動勉；作强盜，害百姓，作惡多端；倒不如，洗凈手，將嘍囉遺散；投宋邦禦外侮，誓掃腥羶。（旦回身低頭向小生）如此說來，你還不昧良心。（抬頸打量小生甚雄偉，作佩服喜悅狀）你想勸范汝爲投降宋邦，他如不從，你便怎樣…？（小生）那我就……（旦待其回話）哽…（小生）那我就……無法可想了！（旦）唉，依我之見，他如不從，你就與心腹將士，趁機逃走，一同投向岳家軍去攻打金人！（小生）口怕使不的！（旦）有什麼使不的？（小生）倘被范大王捉住，豈不有性命之憂？（旦）那就不用說了，我也就認識你了！（旦又回頭小理，怒介）（小生）慢來，慢來，但須做事機密，或　僥倖能够逃走，也未可知。（旦回身向小生）這　　是。爲人但須行其所是，生死儘可置之度外。不怕死的不一定死，越是怕死，越是逃不了　！（小生）小姐之言，使我頓開茅塞。定當計而行，不負所望。（旦抬頭向小生握其袖作感激狀）此話當眞？（小生）當眞。（旦）果然？（小生）果然。（旦）如此受我一拜！小生扶起）當不的，當不的！（旦）我非是拜你，我拜的是我國又多了一個赤胆忠心的漢子，大宋朝就有救了！（小生）慚愧呀慚愧！小姐請坐！（旦）有坐，請坐！（小生）有坐！小生與小姐萍水相逢，眞是三生有幸。看來小姐像是個官家之女，還未曾請敎。（旦）妾身姓馮，小名玉梅。與家父路過建州，不想被强人强據在此，父親不知何日相見，呵呵呵！（哭介）（小生）小姐不必啼哭。小生范希周也是書香子弟，功名未就，暫住在此。不想與小姐相逢，可說是天賜良緣。倘蒙不棄，願結絲蘿，待小生慢慢尋訪令尊便了。（旦背介）事已至此，看來此人也是良善之輩，少年英俊，被迫在此；况有報國大志，不如從他，藉便隨時砥礪，也不枉我馮玉梅一片愛國的心腸！（對小生白）鋒鏑餘生，惟仗維護。（小生）旣蒙金諾，欣喜無旣！小生有祖傳寶鏡，乃是兩鏡合扇，淸光照澈，可開可合，其中鑄成鴛鴦二字，名爲鴛鴦寶鏡。我切下一面，就將另一面，膾與小姐，作爲聘禮。（出鏡贈介，旦受鏡介）你我回家去罷。正是：萍水相逢似故知，（旦）文禽比翼好相依。（小生）若還遂得平生願，萬把鋼刀殺胡兒！（同下）</p>
<h3>夜大學</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>有錢的人家，經濟力量足供子弟進大學，乃至到外國去留學，鍍了金回來，但子弟偏是不長進，讀書其名，遊蕩其實，一張中學文憑都混不到；沒有錢的人家，子弟很聰明，又是有志氣，滿想畢業大學，而家裏的經濟力量却够不上，祇有中途輟學，充乎其量高中畢業之後，就要離開學校，尋找職業：這好像已成了一種公式，而會使人感到造物的不平，人類爲何要有貧富。</p>
<p>一個靑年，爲了環境，不能受到理想的敎育，一朝離開學校生活之後，踏進社會，有時爲了學識的不够，處理事件，常會感到困難，有時爲了姿格問題，同樣做事，而地位懸殊，所獲得的報酬也比別人來得少。碰到了道種事情，內心所感到的苦痛和憤恨，是沒有體騐過的人所不會知道的。</p>
<p>凡是有志的靑年，處在這樣的一個環境裏面，發奮之下，祇有抱了决心，利用業餘去補習，增進自己的敎育。但一般的補習學校，多半是中等程度，職業靑年的已有中等程度者，想利用業餘，白天服務，夜晚讀書者，每會感到補習學校的沒有大學程度的科目，雖是有志，也沒有地方去補習。</p>
<p>的確，本來所有的大學校，都在白天上課，然而也許辦敎育的人，也看到了職業靑年感到學力不足，無處補習的苦悶，而在上海這都市裹，也有幾個大學，在夜晚上課，就是本文所謂夜大學了。這樣，你在社會服務，而同時要求進步，便可利用業餘，白天做事，夜晚讀書了。</p>
<p>說起了夜大學，在上海資格最老，歷史挺久的，恐怕是東吳吧？不過東吳祗有法科，而且規定的資格很嚴，要大學預科畢業的才得投考，畢業之後，資格完全和白天上課的大學相同。爲了資格問題，也許使許多中等學校畢業過的職業靑年，望門興歎，無法投考。但歷來東吳的夜大學，另一面，是許多進過大學而中途輟學，踏進社會的職業靑年，得到一個很好的機會，幾年以來，東吳的確會造成過不少大律師</p>
<p>繼東吳之後，持志法科，上海法學院，法政學院等，也在夜問上課，當然也會造成過不少律師人才。除了法科之外，國立商學院有過一時，夜間也開課的，但後來爲了敎育部對於大學法規重行制定，凡是晚間上課者，限得很嚴，所以商學院就取消晚間的課程。「一二八」後，巳故滬江大學校長劉湛恩先生，爲使一般的好靑年，業餘時閒能够有地方補習，受到大學敎育起見，創辦滬江大學城中區商學院於圓明園路，以商科爲主，而附設新聞專修科，特科等。每天自下午五時起開始上課。一時有志靑年，利用業餘而進滬江夜大學的達五六百人。所惜爲敎育部法規所限，夜校沒有正式立案，未免使求學者感到不滿而已。</p>
<p>筆者也會在夜大學裏念過兩年書，每天晚上，走去上課。看到有許多職業靑年，都在機關或洋行裏服務，到了下午五時才走出寫字間，便挾了書本，忙着到學校裏上課，每一個都很匆急，陸續的走進校門，怕要遲到。如果有幾個晚上，一連上三四課，那就餓了肚子讀書，到了九十點鐘才得回去吃夜飯。在課堂裹，每一個都寂靜的埋倒了頭聽敎授的講解，這種精神，是爲白天上課的學校中的學生所沒有的。</p>
<p>「八一三」之後，在南市，閘北的幾所大學，無法上課，有的遷往內地，有的搬進租界。可是爲了租界上人口擠居，校舍發生了問題，好幾所大學，租不到校舍，就借用中等學校的校舍上課。然而那些中學，自己也要上課，所以祇能在課後把校舍出借，而使臨時借用校舍的大學，非要等到四時以後上課不可，多數課程，排在晚上。道樣一來，白天上課的大學，暫時也好像變做夜大學了。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第五回　春到碧蘿香浮雪海　花飛虎阜月滿蠡湖</p>
<p>何儷玉道：『現在你們這兩位表兄在那裹呢？』吳君素道：『大的一位是飛機師，小的一位在砲兵學咬畢業，這兩位表兄是最能吃苦，最能耐勞的人了。要是沒有這一次打仗，只怕大起來，也不過是添了兩位寫意朋友，養成些驕奢成性的大少爺罷了。所以在這大時代的戰爭中，造成了不少有用的人物呢。』吳君素是一位健談家，打開了話匣子，便幾個鐘頭可以講下去。她們坐在「閑雲」水閣裏，看那湖上白雲，卷舒自如，眞覺得境地悠閑。何雙玉擎着一杯茶在手裏，在玻璃杯裏，顯得淸碧可愛，便問道：『蘇州也有茶葉嗎？』吳君素道：『出是出一些兒，却是極少極少。蘇州太湖七十二峰的最大兩峰，也稱之爲洞庭山，出了一種茶葉，這名字是雅極了，喚做碧蘿春。每年所出不多，近來那邊的茶農，在那裹推廣試種，巳經比前出得多了。』何雙玉道。『呀！好個名兒。這碧蘿春三字，已經使人齒頰留芬了。碧蘿春可有購買之處？』吳君素道：『那也不過名字好聽，其實茶葉也不過如此。我是不講究喝茶的，講究的人，不科吃茶，却呌品茗。聽說你們貴鄉的人，很考究品茗。不但考究茶葉，而且還要考究水，最考究的是從梅花的雪水受了下來烹茶。那眞是有閑階級，寫意朋友所做的事，』未愛人道：『不差！我想起來了！此地石湖，和光福玄墓很近了。要是兩位姊姊，在臘盡春回的時候，到這裏來，我們可以同到玄墓去看梅花。那個地方全是種的白梅花，在花開了全盛時代，自遠　去，正是白茫茫一片，成了一個花海。到了臨近，身在萬梅花下，猶似把身體沉浸在香海之中，眞覺得微妙不可思議。因叱那個地方，會有人題了一個名字，喚做香雪海。』吳君素道：『朱醫師幾時曾去游過，聽你這幾句話，形容得眞妙，大有詩意呢。』朱愛人笑道。『只許你們文學家，有一枝筆，能傳神入妙嗎？良辰美景，誰也能感覺到的呢。』吳君素道：『放心吧！我知道何家兩位姊姊，她們一時不回到粵南去，我們正好陪她們游玩咧。』（五七）</p>

<h3>國際影訊</h3>
<p>— （張佩英）</p>
<p>意思國片到處禁映日日籍明星被排斥蘇聯電影業猛進英國影界新變動荷蘭華僑愛國片林語堂在美編劇影城反抗法西斯</p>
<p>（一）索里尼，前在意京創辦「電影村」，專門從事攝製宣傳意大利獨裁國動態之影片，該項影片於去年中共攝製一百八十四部，迭經運往國外放映。總計在美國公映者僅十八部，在英公映者四十四部，而最多者當然推他的同志——德國，則達七十二部，餘均禁映。</p>
<p>（二）日本籍女明星上村孃，向隸屬于美國派拉蒙影片已有七八年歷史，最近突被該公司予以解職，其原因爲中日大戰後，她的出品賣座慘跌，爲公司當局不滿而出此舉。按好萊塢之外籍演員被排斥，尚屬創聞。</p>
<p>（三）蘇聯自第二决五年計劃完成後，其電影事業亦突然猛進。最近正在攝製新開片達四萬餘卷，以便送往一九三九年紐的世界博覽會開映。此項短片，足使國外觀眾明暸蘇聯之概况及其國力之强盛。</p>
<p>（四）英國影界近特有一莫大之變動，蓋有一企業團體，名斐利浦合股企業公司，預備收買全英各地電影院六百所至七百所。同時有一奧迪安公司，亦預備收買屬於高蒙影片公司之三百所影院。據一般人猜測，此組織之幕後，定有若干從德國逃亡出來之猶太富翁　撐腰，故才有此雄厚之資本。</p>
<p>（五）荷蘭的華僑很多，所以國產影片在荷蘭原佔着相當勢力，戰事發生後，無形中被粤語片壟斷了整個市塲，使僑胞的信仰祖國的熱心减退許多，故無不渴望上海的國語片能早日運往。</p>
<p>（六）中國著名幽默作家林語堂，旅美從事著作及編劇，風行一時，頗受國外人士歡迎。最近並代童星秀蘭鄧波兒編著了一個新劇本，題名「小匠人」，即將開始拍攝，按國人在好萊塢編劇，以此爲嚆矢。</p>
<p>（七）好萊塢製片家，最近極力攝製關於戰事的影片，以迎合世界人類的心理。</p>
<p>（八）美國反法西斯的活動在好萊塢，也有着鮮明的表現與强勁的力量，據統計，有一萬五千個電影界從丈員已加入了反法西斯委員會，（其中有主演「大地」的名星保羅茂尼，露意絲萊娜等）。援助中國及西班牙的呼聲已震撼了整個的銀都。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一一六）</h3>
<p>孫老元拉胡琴時能吸鼻煙</p>
<p>第一就是指法好，包腔圓，琴音瞭亮，花點動聽，連處如大衣無縫，斷處似斬釘截鐡；至於下把胡琴，更是他所獨擅。這些佳處，且不說它。單論他定絃的工夫，只是嘎嘎兩響，已經畢事。等到唱角一開口，剛合他所需要的調門，半點都不會弄錯的。這比普通一般人橫定也不合適，豎定也不得勁，在後台忙豁半天，等到角兒一開口，仍是望着塲面上瞪眼的情形，要强過百倍了。此外像他接絃的快當，也是人所難及。</p>
<p>有一天叔岩唱全本「空城計，」那天座上客滿，叔岩的嗓音也特別好。我同幾個朋友得到前三排中間的位置，格外聽看得清楚。孫老穿了一件古老的樟絨馬褂，留着楊香五式上七下八的黃鬍鬚，提着一把烏黑的胡琴，剛望塲面上一坐，就聽見滿園的鼓掌聲。他料想今天來的人，裏面，必定有些賞音家。「失街亭」裹除去「兩國交鋒龍虎鬥」一段原板外，其餘緊打慢唱的板裏，當然是難顯所長；及至城樓上的慢板一開始，眞是有了用武之地了。唱的好還沒停止，胡琴的好又接了上來，孫老越拉越高興，等到叔岩唱第七句「周文王訪姜尚周室大振」時，他趂着「振」字下要長腔的當兒，忽用右手的中指向預置在左腿膝蓋上的象牙鼻烟盤上抹了一些鼻烟，在弓子望上一提的一剎那之間，竟把右中指上醮的鼻烟。順手吸進兩鼻孔裹，快當自然，一點都不影響到叔岩的唱腔同他的托音。這時我在台口瞧得極眞切，使我不由自主的連連呌了幾個好，那時瞧見的當然不止我一人，都也隨着喝起彩來。他這一手。眞可算神乎其技。現在時隔二十年了，閉目一想，彷彿如在眼前一樣。</p>

<h3>舞女素描第五節</h3>
<p>舞女中常有一種普遍心理，即將來的歸宿問題，此種心理，不能謂之不正當，樹高千丈，葉落歸根，也可說是一般人的普遍心理，不獨舞女爲然也。</p>
<p>說到舞女的出身，可說成份複雜，有小家碧玉，也有大家閨秀；有進過學堂的女學生；也有當過妓女的窰變；有的是一家衣食無着，不得已而令其兒女作此生涯者；也有是被匪人拐誘，輾轉販押而被逼度此營生者；形形色色，筆難盡罄，以其知識不齊，願望亦異，有的說：「願做庭前一稞草，不做人家一個小」。有的說：「做大做小，都是自己的命運，命好時嫁到人家是小，但不久他家的大就物化了，要是自己命壞，男人娶你是大，但不久就老二老三的接連地進來了，所謂要嫁丈夫一條心，不必堂前做夫人，此願望作妻做妾之別也。有的以爲嫁男人爲的是享榮華受富貴，听以不問對方的性情如何，品貌如何，那怕老到七八十歲，只要有錢供我享用，便可以嫁得。有的以爲嫁人是一生一世的事，必須要品貌俊秀，性情溫和，纔算合格，至於有錢沒錢的問題，倒是小事，此講求物質享受與精神享受之別也。又有一種見解，在舞女中實占最多數的，以爲舞客們的光降跳舞塲，不過是消遺性質，對於舞女，不過是玩玩主義，玩厭了就再換一個，根本就談不到終身問題。所以舞女們對於舞客所抱態度，應該採取金錢主義，享樂性質，見到有錢的就榨些錢，遇着漂亮的就尋尋樂，設或遇見旣有錢而又漂亮的，那就不妨尋樂與榨錢同時並進，倘若碰見吝嗇而又老醜的，不妨直截了當，一脚踢開，今天東姘姘，明日西軋軋，且圖個眼前快樂，至於將來的問題，且到將來再說，這種主義，錯也不能說她錯，對也不能說她對，總之，結局還是苦的多罷了。還有一種見解，舞女中可說絕無僅有的，以爲生不逢辰，以致墮入風塵，豈可再自暴棄，我賣的是一雙脚，决不是要的靈魂與身體，抱定宗旨，守身如玉，舞塲中每日來往的，人山人海，其中豈遂無一可托終身者，每逢舞客之徵逐漸頻而叉並非吝嗇醜劣之流，則盤詰周詳，非至詳審性情而又盟訂嫁娶，决不犧牲貞操，然此種人，吾見其人而未聞其言也，聞其言而未辨其眞僞也。聊書於此，以備一格云耳。</p>

<h3>The Northeast Guerrilla Force Gains Momentum; Two Hundred Thousand People Are Organized into Ten Armies Under the Jurisdiction of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Association</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to authoritative sources speaking to the Associated Press, the Japanese 18th Division, along with large numbers of Mongolian and "Manchukuo" troops, are currently engaged in a "campaign to wipe out Chinese guerrilla forces" in North China, fiercely fighting with approximately five hundred thousand Chinese guerrilla fighters. In order to deal with this situation, the Chinese guerrilla forces are currently busy organizing and recruiting guerrilla forces from the forests and deep mountains of Manchuria. To date, they have gathered two hundred thousand people, organized into ten "armies." Most of these guerrilla forces are Manchurian people who joined the volunteer army and fought against the Japanese army since the Mukden Incident in 1931. They were later dispersed by the Japanese army and are now being reorganized into an army to carry out guerrilla warfare in their homeland. These newly organized guerrilla forces are under the jurisdiction of the "Northeast Anti-Japanese Association," which is under the control of Chongqing. The reorganization of the Chinese guerrilla forces in the Northeast is the result of a government decision to restore China's legitimate administrative power in the Northeast. The location of the headquarters of the Chinese guerrilla forces in the Northeast is a military secret and will not be disclosed. (Dispatch from the 10th, Associated Press)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Re-Examining the Question of Amending the Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this year, when the 76th US Congress reconvened, President Roosevelt sent a message to Congress advocating for the amendment of the existing Neutrality Act. The editorial of this newspaper on January 7 pointed out that the existing Neutrality Act is not only insufficient to protect the United States from being drawn into the vortex of war, but also passively contributes to the atrocities of aggressors, causing her own legitimate interests to be repeatedly violated. If the United States wants to maintain its legitimate interests, it can only actively adopt effective sanctions against aggressors. President Roosevelt's request to amend the Neutrality Act is a preliminary step in sanctioning aggressors. Therefore, we hope that the isolationists in the US Congress can realize their previous mistakes and amend the indiscriminate Neutrality Act that they created, in order to stop the atrocities of the aggressors. Unfortunately, at that time, the isolationists in the Senate were still infatuated with outdated and backward concepts and postponed the issue again.</p>
<p>The isolationists in the United States still believe that the United States can be separated from Europe, Africa, and the Far East by the floods of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Despite the war clouds spreading there, the United States can always avoid being drawn into the vortex, so the current Neutrality Act does not need to be amended. When the views of these isolationists prevailed, the aggressors knew that as long as they did not directly infringe on the United States, the United States would not take any action other than verbally supporting the maintenance of peace. As a result, they became even more unscrupulous and engaged in more aggressive aggression. After Britain and France recognized Franco's regime in Spain, Italy actively promoted anti-French propaganda, increased troops in North Africa, and prepared to make unreasonable demands on France. Germany also formulated a plan to pressure Britain and France, preparing to issue an ultimatum to Britain and France when Italy made demands on France, and even to seize the Netherlands and Switzerland by lightning means, forcing Britain and France to submit. On the other hand, taking advantage of the opportunity that Britain and France were busy in the Mediterranean and unable to take care of the Pacific, they instigated Japan to launch a southward policy, creating a "September 18th Incident" in the Pacific, threatening the interests of the United States in the Pacific. This is the result of the isolationists' insistence on implementing the current Neutrality Act.</p>
<p>Recently, the issue of amending the Neutrality Act has once again become a central issue in the US Congress. Originally, the effective period of the "cash and carry" clause in the current Neutrality Act will expire on May 1, so it has to be discussed again. The so-called "cash and carry" means that third countries must trade with the United States in "cash" and transport the military supplies themselves. This provision treats aggressor and victim countries equally. Therefore, the implementation of this bill in fact completely facilitates the aggressor countries. The production of military supplies in aggressor countries must be greater than that of the victim countries. If the victim countries want to resist the aggressors, they must purchase a large number of military supplies from third countries, but the economic status of the victim countries is mostly relatively backward. Therefore, under the "cash and carry" provisions, it is difficult to obtain a large supply of munitions. Secondly, the military equipment of the aggressor countries is also more complete. After purchasing military supplies, they have their own merchant ships to load and a strong navy to protect transportation, while the victim countries have neither merchant ships nor warships. Therefore, after the implementation of this Neutrality Act, the aggressors are not unable to buy military supplies in the United States because of this, but the victim countries are instead blockaded. It is no wonder that President Roosevelt shouted loudly that the current Neutrality Act not only does not help peace, but also promotes war.</p>
<p>According to a Havas dispatch from Washington on the 9th, if the US Congress can expand the scope of implementation of "cash and carry," then the two naval powers of Britain and France will be able to control maritime transportation and have sufficient financial resources to pay for goods in cash, and will be able to obtain various necessities from the United States, which will be more advantageous than the totalitarian countries. If the US Congress really passes and implements this method, then it can be an ally of Britain and France in Europe, but it will inevitably be an ally of Japan in Asia. We believe that far-sighted members of Congress who are committed to world peace will never agree to this approach. We hope that Congress will pass the suggestion of Representative Thomas: authorizing the President and Congress to determine any country that violates international treaties signed by the United States as an aggressor country, and at the same time provide military supplies to the victim. This is the only way to effectively stop the atrocities of the aggressors, maintain world peace, and protect the legitimate interests of the United States.</p>

In addition, the Central Daily News commented on Chinese-British relations, stating that only China's independence and strength can ensure France's position in the Far East. In addition, the Saodang Daily suggested in its commentary that France should create a "Pacific Mutual Assistance Agreement" between Britain, the United States, France, and the Soviet Union to resist Japanese aggression. At the same time, France should allow foreign munitions to be freely transported to China via Annam. (Dispatch from the 10th, Associated Press)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Yichang Madly; Civilian Casualties Exceed One Thousand Five Hundred; Although British and American Churches Flew Large Flags, Japanese Planes Still Bombed Indiscriminately</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Detailed reports from foreign sources in Yichang regarding the fierce Japanese bombing of Yichang on the 7th and 8th of this month stated that a bomb fell in the courtyard of the children's school run by the Scottish Church, and another seven bombs fell in the courtyard of the American Church. In total, two foreign residences were destroyed, and all other buildings were damaged. Two large American flags laid on the ground in the courtyard were damaged by rubble and were almost unrecognizable. Deaconess Lai Bai narrowly escaped death when a bomb fell within fifteen feet of where she was standing. It was fortunate that she survived. Six bombs fell on the American-Chinese School. The American Episcopal Church flew American flags high, and American flags were also laid on the ground. The Scottish Church Children's School also flew large flags, which were easily identifiable, but Japanese planes still dropped bombs. The exact number of deaths and injuries has not yet been ascertained, but it is now believed to be over one thousand five hundred people. (Dispatch from the 10th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, twenty-seven Japanese planes attacked Yichang again yesterday. Eighteen planes bombed in the morning, and another nine planes dropped bombs in the afternoon. The central and southeastern districts of Yichang were the targets of the Japanese bombing. Although seven bombs fell on a foreign residence and one bomb hit a Scottish school, there were no foreign casualties. It is reported that after the Japanese bombing of Yichang on March 8, over three hundred bodies have been unearthed from the rubble. (Dispatch from the 10th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Yichang) When Japanese planes bombed Yichang madly on the 8th, they deliberately bombed a part of the American church buildings on Er Ma Road and Kangzhuangmen. The bishops of the two churches believe that the Japanese are acting so recklessly and intentionally harming the interests of third countries. They have cabled their consulates-general in China to lodge a serious protest with the Japanese. (Special dispatch on the 10th)</p>
<h3>The Issue of the Residence of Jewish Refugees in China; The Location Has Not Yet Been Decided</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) It is reported that the Chinese government is currently giving careful consideration to the proposal to allow Jewish refugees to reside in China. The issue of location has not yet been decided. Kong Xiangxi, President of the Executive Yuan, originally had a proposal to provide Hainan Island for Jewish people to reside in, but the Japanese army is currently fighting on Hainan Island, causing the proposal to stall. It has now been suggested that Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, and Xikang be considered as places for Jewish people to reside. (Dispatch from the 10th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Wartime Children's Care Association Anniversary</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, the 10th, is the anniversary of the Wartime Children's Care Association. The General Association and the Sichuan Branch will hold a commemorative meeting today. Chairperson Madame Chiang personally attended and delivered a speech, stating that the association's past work has focused on rescue, and more attention should be paid to education in the future. To make these children excellent and eternal successors of the nation, it is necessary to establish a foundation of education and upbringing. She then thanked those at home and abroad who are enthusiastic about children's care and the directors of the association, and encouraged them to continue their efforts to serve the children in distress. The association also decided to send a telegram to thank those who donated money at home and abroad. The original telegram stated, "The general assembly has been established for a year, and its work has a rough outline. Fortunately, with the enthusiasm of people from all walks of life, they have generously donated money and provided food to raise and nurture [the children], completing a righteous cause together. All the children are bathed in virtue and grace. On the occasion of this general assembly, we deeply appreciate your friendship. We are grateful for your assistance in the past, and we hope for your encouragement in the future. We hereby send this telegram to express our gratitude. The Wartime Children's Care Association Anniversary Meeting respectfully kowtows." (10th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Dalai Lama to Reincarnate Soon, Three Incarnates Found, One a Five-Year-Old Child</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Reuters today, responsible sources report that as of now, there are five possible candidates for the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama. However, only three have been recognized by the Lhasa authorities. It is reported that the Tibetan authorities are currently trying to bring these three to Lhasa and will hold a drawing of lots to determine who is the true Dalai Lama. It is said that one of the three is a five-year-old child who is currently in Qinghai. The other two reside in Tibet. The Lhasa authorities are currently negotiating with the Qinghai authorities to send this child to Lhasa for the drawing of lots ceremony. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Xi'an, Destroying British Property, Japanese Army Disregards Special Markings, British Foreign Office Decides to Issue Strong Protest</h3>
<p>(London) The British Foreign Office announced today that the Liebertzuhn (transliteration) Memorial Hospital and the Baptist Church in Xi'an are British property. Although they have special markings to distinguish them, the Japanese army disregarded everything and bombed the two British-owned properties during the air raid on Xi'an on Wednesday, completely destroying the two buildings. Moreover, at that time, British flags were specially placed on the ground of the two buildings so that the air force could see them clearly from above. Furthermore, several months ago, the British side notified the Japanese authorities of the location of British property. The Foreign Office further stated that it would immediately issue a strong protest against the Japanese army's deliberate destruction of British property. (Associated Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Eighteen Japanese planes wantonly bombed Weinan, west of the county seat, at 11:35 a.m. on the 9th, dropping more than 50 bombs, causing more than a dozen deaths and injuries.

<h3>National Education Conference Declaration: Embracing the Guidance of the Supreme Leader and Creating a New Force for a Modern Nation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) At this education conference, Chairman Chiang personally presided over the meeting and interacted with sincerity. The members deeply admire and appreciate this spirit. We believe that the national education cause will surely achieve unified steps in will and universal improvement through mutual cooperation. The future of our education cause is infinitely bright. We in the education community pay our highest respect to our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang. His great spirit of leading the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction with unwavering determination has long been admired by our national education community. We are honored to receive his personal instructions this time. What he told us is not only far-sighted, but he also revealed to us "that the Three Principles of the People, which are based on revolution and saving the country, should be the highest standard of education in our country, to implement the program of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction, and to create a new life for a modern nation. The new life force of a modern nation is composed of three elements: education, economy, and military force. Education is the foundation of all undertakings." He further revealed to us, "We must create a modern country that has vitality and a promising future for China from all kinds of hardships and difficulties." We unanimously and sincerely use the guidance of the supreme national leader and the enlightenment of the supreme leader to encourage our colleagues in the national education community. We must have a strong will, and our education community must fulfill its responsibility to save the country and build the nation. Indeed, we still need to intensify our efforts, but we absolutely oppose the saying of some people that education has gone bankrupt, and we cannot admit the training that casually negates the value of education. We have been fighting in the War of Resistance for more than twenty months, and we are getting stronger as we fight. We do not know how much of this is due to the education we have received in the past thirty years. Since the War of Resistance, the national consciousness of the whole country has been universally promoted, and the heroic bravery of the soldiers at the front, especially the young officers, who have shed blood in the war, is a manifestation of the power of education. From now on, in order to win the victory of the War of Resistance and achieve the success of national reconstruction, and to increase the efficiency of education, our education community urgently needs to redouble its efforts. Chairman Chiang often says, "We should treat peacetime as wartime, and wartime as peacetime." He also said, "We must not forget the basics for the sake of emergency." These are truly wise words. Only by treating wartime as peacetime can we move forward calmly and persevere. Only by treating peacetime as wartime can we engage in our work with tension and take the initiative. We cannot forget that we not only want to resist the war, but also want to build the country. We must review our past shortcomings and strive to improve in order to comfort our own conscience. Our previous education has had many undeniable shortcomings in knowledge. We must train young people to be national educators, and we must have well-rounded and healthy intellectuals who are also healthy national teachers. Training young people must be given equal importance to training the masses. Training young people to establish themselves and be human is fundamental, and young people should be familiar with the history and geography of their country in order to inspire national concepts. However, the difficulties and pains of the future may be a hundred times greater than today. All our colleagues in the national education community must further recognize their extraordinary responsibility in the country, their hardship, and their example in order to set an example, change the atmosphere, rectify discipline, sacrifice generously, save honestly, and fight together for life and death. Furthermore, with healthy citizens, there must be a common faith to achieve unity of talent, and the people will be of one mind, and the strength will not be wasted. The Three Principles of the People has become the creed of the whole people, uniting the nation and consolidating the country. There is only this way. We hope that our colleagues in the national education community will take the realization of the Three Principles of the People as their own responsibility, deeply study it, and make it a common belief in general knowledge and a common political consciousness of the people, which are indispensable conditions for a modern unified country. For several years, because young people lacked a common political consciousness, the country did not know how many sacrifices it had gone through. The whole country has a unified consciousness of upholding the Three Principles of the People, which is the beginning of national rejuvenation. Colleagues in the education community should have a unified and sincere belief in this and use it to train young people. This is not only a passive way to avoid future disasters for the country, but also a proactive way to lead the nation to independence, equality, wealth, strength, and happiness. The supreme leader has shown us that education cannot be separated from politics, and the education community cannot abandon the country and society and not ask about it. We respect this meaning and are willing to embrace the common belief in the Three Principles of the People to train the spirit of the whole people in our country. (9th dispatch)</p>

In addition to killing more than a hundred people on the spot, the remaining three hundred Japanese and puppet troops were all captured. Hua's troops won a complete victory. Among the captured Japanese troops, there was also a Japanese commander. In addition, more than ten light machine guns, more than three hundred rifles and carbines, and many other military supplies were seized. (10th dispatch)</p>

It is now said that the recent military goal of the Japanese army is to advance towards Huaiyin and Siyang. However, the Chinese army in the area has strong defenses and is sufficient to inflict a major blow on the Japanese army. (Fast News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>

<h3>Tianjin-Hankou American Chamber of Commerce Demands Sanctions Against Japan, British Ambassador Negotiates with Japanese Foreign Ministry, Puppet Currency in North China Unable to Circulate in Various Regions</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to the U.S. Department of Commerce today, the American Chamber of Commerce in North China has asked the U.S. government to take further action to protect American interests in Japanese-occupied areas. According to American businessmen in North China, the North China exchange and trade control measures to be implemented by the Japanese tomorrow are aimed at excluding American commerce in North China. The Japanese are using their puppets to implement restrictions on exports and exchange controls, apparently to deprive American industries of the Chinese raw materials they need, while at the same time preventing American goods from entering the North China market. Moreover, judging from the accumulated actions of the Japanese in North China, the Japanese purpose is clearly to drive out American commerce in North China. The American Chamber of Commerce in Hankou also expressed great dissatisfaction with the Japanese infringement of American rights and interests in China, especially the Japanese restrictions on foreign ships and the movement of foreign nationals in the Yangtze River. The passes presented by American nationals in Hankou are often not recognized by the Japanese. Nationals of any third country must obtain a pass from the Japanese. At the same time, according to a report from the American Chamber of Commerce in Hankou, in the one month since the Japanese army occupied Hankou, as many as three thousand Japanese ships have arrived in Hankou. American and other foreign businesses have been subjected to various difficulties by the Japanese, but Japanese goods can be freely sold in Hankou. At the same time, the Japanese are also freely transporting Chinese products to Japan. Finally, the American Chamber of Commerce in Hankou also asked the U.S. government to take strong retaliatory measures against Japan. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The newspapers here have praised the proposal of foreign businessmen in Tianjin asking their national governments to take retaliatory actions against Japan's control of trade in North China. The newspapers all stated that the interests of Britain and the United States and Japan are completely in contradictory conflict, and there is no possibility of reconciliation. Therefore, they expressed surprise that Britain and the United States have not yet taken retaliatory measures. As for the trade control and exchange control currently implemented by Japan in North China, the purpose is clearly to intensify its economic war against Britain, the United States, and other countries. Therefore, if Britain and the United States want to protect their interests in China, in addition to providing more economic assistance to China, they must also take retaliatory actions against Japan. The Chinese Army's organ newspaper, *Sweeping Away*, published an article today praising the letter from former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson to the *New York Times*. The newspaper stated that although Stimson is a Republican leader, he not only fully supported President Roosevelt's advocacy of cooperation with Britain and France to confront the dictatorial countries, but also went on to advocate that the United States should seek naval cooperation with Britain and France once they were attacked. This spirit of discussing matters on their merits, without bias, is due to Stimson's far-sighted vision and broad mind. At the same time, it is also because Stimson has a full understanding of the indivisibility of peace. In short, Stimson's remarks can be said to be a head-on blow to the American isolationists. (Associated Press dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The plan to abolish legal tender in the entire North China region from the 11th of this month has been temporarily changed. According to the "Provisional Government" announcement today, from March 11th, North China will be divided into two regions in terms of currency circulation, namely the "United Reserve Zone" and the "Bandit Zone." The so-called "United Reserve Zone" is limited to eleven cities in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Tianjin, Qingdao, Yantai, and other places are not included. People in this area will be punished if they are found carrying legal tender after March 11th, and their property will be confiscated. The order also stated that the circulation of "United Reserve Bank" banknotes will be promoted to other places as the Japanese army expands its occupation. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Although there is no official confirmation of the news that Beiping, Tianjin, and other places are not included in the North China "new currency" zone, it coincides with what the London financial community expected. It is said that Japanese businessmen also do not think the original plan is correct. Political and financial figures believe that Japan does not intend to make Anglo-Japanese relations excessively worse. Therefore, the recent order is actually a face-saving measure, not including the truly important central points in the order, but instead applying the order to other places that are not very important. At the same time, the impact of the Sino-British Exchange Stabilization Fund on Chinese currency prices is now attracting attention. *Financial News* said that the exchange rate of legal tender will be around eight and a half pence, while others believe it can reach nine pence. According to Reuters, the actual price of the exchange stabilization has not yet been determined. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Exchange Stabilization Fund Management Committee will be established in Hong Kong. The committee will have five members. HSBC and Mercantile Bank of England, and the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, each from China, will send one person. The other person will be a British person recommended by the Chinese government and confirmed by the British government. From now on, China's economic and financial policies will adopt the value of stabilizing the exchange rate of legal tender against the British pound. The purchase of foreign exchange must be traded with one of the banks of the management committee. (Special dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) The *Financial Times* editorial said that the announcement of the establishment of a Chinese Exchange Stabilization Fund loan in the British Parliament on Wednesday, and the development of the Japanese currency plan in North China came one after another, the coincidence of which is very noteworthy. This loan is undoubtedly beneficial to commerce, but what is expected of British taxpayers and the officialdom is not only to stop at guaranteeing finances. Britain's policy in this regard has also greatly developed, as can be proved by the expansion of export credit loans. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) In the British House of Commons today, a member asked Under-Secretary Butler whether he knew that British commerce in Yantai and Weihaiwei was completely paralyzed because the Japanese did not allow the export of goods that were not purchased with bills of exchange from the Yokohama Specie Bank. Butler replied that he was aware of this. Foreign Secretary Halifax is currently discussing the entire issue of trade and exchange control laws in North China ports with the British ambassador to Japan, Craigie. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<h3>Britain Helps China's Finances, Japan Has No Choice, Domestic Currency Once Tended to Inflate, Still Hopes Britain Will Change Its Policy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Minister of Finance Taro Ishiwatari declared in the Lower House Budget Committee yesterday afternoon that Japan has inevitably experienced currency inflation to a certain extent, but this matter is not worth worrying about. Political figures interpreted this statement as meaning that as a result of the war against China, the purchasing power of the Japanese yen has been reduced. The Tokyo government is now actively using restrictive methods to prevent the devaluation of the currency. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A Foreign Ministry spokesman criticized Britain's financial loan to China at a reception for foreign correspondents today, saying that it was not worthy of serious attention. If the British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon stated that the stability of the Chinese currency system is an element in Britain's economic policy towards China, which can greatly help British businessmen in China, then the British government should grasp the general trend of the East Asia incident by various methods and abandon its policy of assisting Chinese legal tender and assisting the new currency to promote its stability, then it will be seen that the old currency will be converted to the new currency without any difficulty. It is hoped that British politicians with a broad vision will soon realize the mistakes of their policy. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) *Asahi Shimbun* reported that after British Ambassador to Japan Craigie explained Britain's new loan to China to Foreign Minister Arita yesterday, the Japanese Foreign Ministry immediately convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures and decided that it was necessary to warn Britain. It was also decided to carefully study the Japanese reaction. The newspaper continued, "We can say that Britain's attempt to maintain Chinese legal tender has inadvertently joined China's economic guerrilla warfare. Japan may not be without ways to counter it, such as delaying the solution to the Yangtze River navigation issue." Japanese newspapers all carried criticisms authorized by the authorities, and most of them strongly attacked this new currency loan. *Hochi Shimbun* also stated that the Japanese cabinet convened an emergency meeting in the Diet building on Thursday evening to discuss the government's attitude towards this new loan. It was heard that the cabinet had decided to issue a strong protest against this unfriendly act and adopt active countermeasures to resist the new Sino-British agreement. If Britain continues this unfriendly action, Japan should take retaliatory action against British interests in China. (Reuters dispatch, 9th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Britain's lending of huge sums of money to China has aroused extreme indignation throughout Japan. Political figures are speculating whether the Japanese government will lodge a protest with London. According to a Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman this morning, British Ambassador to Japan Sir Craigie has formally notified Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Sawada of the nature and certain details of this loan, stating that Britain had no choice but to lend money to China in order to protect its interests in China and maintain the stability of the Chinese currency. Sawada immediately protested on behalf of the Japanese government. According to the spokesman, Britain's attitude completely disregards the recent developments in the Far East and is intent on maintaining the status quo. (Haitong dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) After Japanese Foreign Minister Arita issued a statement in the Japanese House of Representatives on the 6th of this month (the content of which roughly stated that the "China Incident" was launched by the Communist International, and although Japan is dealing with the Communist International with all its strength, it is not an omnipotent country and does not need to adopt a hostile attitude towards the United States, Britain and France), the *Times* of London correspondent in Tokyo recently sent a telegram to explain it, saying, "This statement implicitly indicates that although Japan has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, it will not endanger Japan's relationship with the United States, Britain and France because of the other signatory countries, namely Germany and Italy. Because although this pact can facilitate Japanese policy at certain points, at other points, it must obtain the approval of the democratic countries, or at least their understanding, before it can achieve anything. Based on this, since Japan has not unconditionally joined the anti-democratic bloc, plans for further and closer cooperation between the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact will be rejected by the Japanese authorities no matter where they come from." (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) After Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon announced in the House of Commons yesterday that he would lend the remaining funds to China, the *Yorkshire Post* (formerly known as the organ of former Foreign Secretary Eden) recently commented, "The British government's decision to help China establish a £10 million exchange stabilization fund is tantamount to a head-on blow to Japan. These negotiations have been going on for some time, and the intention is less to deal with Japan and more to strengthen China's financial foundation to develop trade between China and Britain. Since the Chinese authorities cannot control legal tender, their trade will be adversely affected. The British government has previously granted China credit loans (totaling £500,000), and now it has helped establish an exchange stabilization fund. From then on, Britain's policy of protecting and developing its trade with China will always be effectively promoted." The *Manchester Guardian* stated, "This financial loan has been criticized by Japan as a political move. We will not discuss it for the time being, but it is a real situation that this move has significant meaning and will have far-reaching effects. In short, the financial loan is enough to maintain China's economic health, so Japan cannot have this major condition to subdue China. Based on this, it is undeniable that the influence that this move can cause has a political nature. In the UK's view, this is an unavoidable duty. If the British authorities are afraid that these political influences will be unfavorable to the country because Japan is suspicious, they will be afraid and not help China's finances with concrete methods, that is, the UK will abandon its responsibility to protect its trade with China in order to be wary of Japan's suspicions, that is certainly not the reason."

<h3>Observations from London: The European Situation Has Improved; Italy Will Not Be Overly Demanding of France; Disarmament Will Be Revisited</h3>
<p>(London) Responsible figures here recently stated that the international situation has improved in the past two months. Once the Spanish Civil War ends and the Franco-Italian dispute is peacefully resolved, all involved nations can further discuss the issue of arms limitation. It is reported that when Prime Minister Chamberlain approached Italy in January of this year, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini stated that as long as the Spanish problem and the Franco-Italian dispute remained unresolved, the international situation could not be stabilized. Now that the Spanish Civil War is nearing its end, and the Franco-Italian dispute is likely to be resolved peacefully, the various demands put forward by Italian newspapers and irresponsible individuals should not be given undue weight. In general, the main issues to be discussed when France and Italy negotiate in the future will be the following three: (1) the issue of French Somaliland's Djibouti port; (2) the issue of the Djibouti port railway to Addis Ababa; (3) the issue of the legal status of Italian nationals in French Tunisia in North Africa. Although there is currently no information on the content of the demands that the Italian government plans to make, it is expected that the country will make many demands to create room for bargaining, and it can be asserted that a compromise solution will eventually be found. Once the Spanish problem and the Franco-Italian dispute are resolved successively, all nations can negotiate on the issue of arms limitation. Even if only a small-scale arms reduction agreement can be reached, it will be of great benefit to restoring confidence and boosting world trade. As for the articles still appearing in German newspapers criticizing democratic nations, and the aggressive remarks made by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels at the Leipzig city market recently, their purpose is only for domestic propaganda and should not be given too much weight. The claim that many key German figures have anti-British sentiments is also considered an exaggeration. For example, although Labor Front leader Robert Ley is a radical figure in the National Socialist Party, he also sincerely expressed sympathy and goodwill towards Britain during his meeting with Prime Minister Chamberlain. In addition, Overseas Trade Minister Hudson will soon go to Berlin to conduct economic negotiations with German government officials. This trip is also of great importance, and based on the recent informal contacts between Britain and Germany, the prospects for economic negotiations are optimistic. This is another factor in easing the situation. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) British officials recently made statements that the international situation has improved in the past two months and that the future is relatively optimistic. German political figures, upon hearing this, offered commentary, expressing doubt, and stating, "As long as the spiritual disarmament of totalitarian nations by Britain and the United States is not achieved," there is no need to talk about arms reduction. The urgent priority is that Britain and the United States should first advise the Soviet Union to reduce its armaments. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The French newspaper "L'Ere Nouvelle" reported yesterday that Führer Hitler plans to seize the Netherlands and Switzerland within this year by surprise means, thereby coercing the democratic nations of Western Europe into submission. Semi-official circles here recently denied this, saying, "This is nonsense, not worth laughing at." (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Foreign Secretary Announces Policy on Spain: Does Not Recognize Nationalists' Blockade But Trusts Their Guarantee of Independence</h3>
<p>(London) The House of Lords discussed the Spanish issue this afternoon. After the members spoke, Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax explained the government's position, which included two points: (1) Regarding the Spanish Nationalist government's plan to blockade the coast controlled by the Republican government, the British government has instructed its warships that whenever they encounter submarines attempting to sink British ships, they should retaliate, even within Spanish territorial waters. (2) Expressing trust in the guarantee provided by the Spanish Nationalist government authorities to maintain the territorial integrity of the country, while also stating that if this guarantee cannot be kept, an extremely serious situation will develop as a result. The following is a summary of Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech. The Foreign Secretary first stated that after the Spanish Nationalist government decided to blockade the coast controlled by the Republican government, the British Admiralty had already notified British ships that "the government believes that the Nationalist authorities have no intention of taking any action outside territorial waters, but I must make it clear that if the Nationalists take any action outside territorial waters, the British government will have no choice but to take appropriate measures, following past practice, to retaliate. If any submarine attacks a British ship without issuing a warning or ensuring the safety of the crew in an appropriate manner, the British government will consider it a most serious event and has instructed its warships to take the necessary measures to protect British ships and retaliate against such submarines, even within Spanish territorial waters. As for the general situation in Spain, maintaining the territorial integrity of the country is extremely important to the British government. Regarding this matter, the Nationalist government has repeatedly provided guarantees. Some may fear that this guarantee may not be worth anything, but the British government believes that this guarantee has been accepted in good faith, and others must also keep it in good faith. If not, an extremely serious situation will ensue. It can be asserted that regarding the request for the Nationalist government to issue an amnesty decree, some advocate that the British government should do its best for the Republican government authorities. It should be known that the British government is exchanging views with the Nationalist authorities, and there is a possibility of reaching a peaceful solution. If Britain openly sides with the Madrid government, it will only spoil things. If the Nationalist government and the Republican government can reach an agreement in the future, the British government will do its best to help implement it. This has been mentioned repeatedly, and I emphasize it again." (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The House of Lords discussed the Spanish issue this afternoon. First, opposition Labor Party member Lord Snell proposed a motion, stating that since the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War, the British government's policies have failed and national interests have been greatly damaged. Now, all attention should be focused on the situation in Spain to ensure that the promise of maintaining territorial integrity can be realized. As for the relief of refugees and the safety of Republican government personnel, these are secondary matters. He then gave a speech, stating that the government had pressured France to recognize the Spanish Nationalist government and had allowed Spanish Republican government personnel to be disposed of by General Franco, which was inappropriate. "Now there is a person who has brazenly betrayed his own government, how can it be guaranteed that he will not betray our country?" Former Air Minister Lord Swinton then spoke, expressing his support for the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government, and stated that the Soviet Union was the first to interfere in the Spanish Civil War. Lord Cecil stated that the non-intervention policy was a shameful farce. Finally, Foreign Secretary Halifax delivered an important speech, ending the debate. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>Madrid: All Communists Surrender; 1,400 Captured, Nationalists Say They Will Attack</h3>
<p>Madrid: An official communiqué recently announced that the Communist headquarters has surrendered and that a total of 1,400 party members have been captured.</p>
<p>(Paris) News has just arrived from Madrid, stating that the Communist headquarters surrendered to Prime Minister Miaja this evening. Earlier, Mr. Walter Garcia volunteered to mediate, but to no avail. Until 8:00 a.m. this morning, government forces resumed their attack. For a time, the sound of cannons boomed, mixed with the sound of machine guns. The intensity subsided slightly until noon. The central district of the city was extremely chaotic. Soon, the government dispatched fresh troops to suppress the Communists, who finally succumbed. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Burgos: According to news received here, the Communists in Madrid, Valencia, and other cities are now clearly determined to overthrow the Defense Committee. It is reported that the Defense Committee is dominant in all cities. People here believe that the current chaos in Madrid can only be stopped by a large-scale Nationalist offensive. It appears that the date of the Nationalist offensive is not far off. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Communist Party: Congress Opens Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The 18th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party will open at 5:00 p.m. on March 10 in the Kremlin Palace. Representatives from all over are arriving here one after another, including party workers, commanders of the Red Army, Navy, and Air Force, political instructors, economic organization staff, scientists, Stakhanovite workers, and outstanding collective farmers. Stalin and the members of the Politburo have been elected as delegates to the Congress by the national party departments and the party congresses of the various ethnic republics. (TASS, 9th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The 18th National Congress of the Soviet Communist Party is scheduled to open today in the Kremlin Palace. Approximately 2,000 delegates, elected by 2 million members of the National Communist Party, will attend. It is noted that the previous Congress was held five years ago, after which the anti-Party elements were purged. Only now is this Congress being convened. There are many proposals to be discussed, the most important of which include: (1) Large-scale denunciations should be condemned; (2) Party members should have the right to criticize and the right to appoint lawyers in court for defense; (3) The conditions for joining the Party should be standardized. In other words, the current conditions for joining the Party, which are convenient for workers, should be extended to all citizens. Because lower-level officials who have not obtained Party membership and are well aware that joining the Party is very difficult and takes a long time are often dispirited, it is necessary to encourage them. Regarding this matter, the Soviet government authorities plan to reduce the conditions for joining the Party. All citizens need only accept the Party's principles without thoroughly studying them, and they will be allowed to obtain Party membership. Informed sources here commented that what the Soviet government is emphasizing now is to stimulate the people's patriotism and make them obey discipline, and no longer focuses on theoretical exploration.

<h3>US to Build Two Giant Warships: 45,000 Tons Each, Costing $200 Million</h3>
<p>(Washington) Chief of Naval Operations Rear Admiral Leahy recently told the press that the Navy Department will begin constructing two battleships with a tonnage of 45,000 tons in the short term. Once the House Appropriations Committee discusses the 1939-40 fiscal year Navy budget (totaling $700,000,000) this month, it will be submitted for discussion. The cost of each ship will be approximately $100 million. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The European edition of the New York Herald Tribune recently carried a cable from New York, stating, "Informed sources in naval circles here say that the Navy Department is planning to build a 45,000-ton battleship, to be named the 'New York,' costing approximately $100 million, and will submit a bill to Congress." (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Middletown, Connecticut: Senator Nye, a Republican from North Dakota and one of the original proposers of the current Neutrality Act, recently gave a speech here, stating that if the United States joins an international collective security plan, it would be tantamount to suicide. The situation in Europe may evolve to a certain stage that would force the United States to participate in the European war for a second time. I am not unaware of this, but before deciding on the mode of participation, we must thoroughly understand the content of this situation in order to better safeguard American interests. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Baltimore, Maryland: Senator Thomas, a Democrat from Utah and a member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, recently gave a speech here, opposing the current Neutrality Act, saying, "This law is enough to prevent the United States from taking effective action in the world. President Roosevelt is also bound by it when a state of war exists, unable to adapt to circumstances and handle international events, and must be amended. For the present, Congress should pass a bill authorizing the President to include various raw materials in addition to munitions in the list of prohibited exports, and after obtaining the consent of Congress, prohibit any country that violates international treaties signed by the United States from purchasing munitions and various raw materials in the United States.

<h3>US and Brazil: Conclude Financial Agreement, US Lends $50 Million to Brazil, Credit Loan of $9.2 Million</h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau recently concluded a financial agreement with Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha, the main points of which are as follows: (1) The United States lends Brazil $50,000,000 in gold to organize a central bank; (2) The US Export-Import Bank provides Brazil with a credit loan to promote bilateral trade, with interest limited to below 5%; (3) The Export-Import Bank provides an additional credit loan of $9,200,000 to the "Bank of Brazil" to maintain exchange rate freedom, to be repaid with principal and interest before June 24, 1941; (4) Brazil's foreign debt denominated in US dollars and with suspended principal and interest payments shall continue to be repaid with principal and interest from August 1 of this year. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The financial agreement concluded between the United States and Brazil is in the form of an exchange of notes, the main points of which are as follows: (1) The Brazilian government promises to take necessary measures on exchange rates to remit cash in order to pay for the value of US imports and the principal and interest of Brazilian bonds issued in US dollars. The principal and interest of these bonds were once suspended, and it is agreed that they will continue to be repaid from August 1 of this year. (2) Brazil shall organize a central bank so that the international pastoral situation can correspond to the regular financial resources held by foreign exchange, but Brazil must be given a credit loan by the United States before holding sufficient gold reserves. (3) The US government agrees to request Congress to approve the loan of gold to the Brazilian government for application under fair conditions, the amount of which is limited to $50,000,000, and when necessary, it can be used as a supplementary gold reserve. Brazil will repay the principal and interest with its gold production. In addition, the United States will send several consultants to assist Brazil in organizing a central bank. Regarding the loan, Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, stating that Brazil currently has 30 tons of gold, valued at $35,000,000, and produces approximately 8 tons of gold annually. The total of both can hold 70 tons of gold after five years, valued at $80,000,000, which is approximately 32% of the total amount of banknotes currently issued in the country. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After the financial agreement between Brazil and the United States was concluded, Undersecretary of State Welles gave a statement to the press, expressing his happiness, saying, "If this agreement can be used well, the trade relationship between Brazil and the United States can have a significant and positive impact." Responsible officials in the United States also stated that the totalitarian nations would conclude barter agreements with Brazil and add certain interests to realize their economic aggression attempts. Now that the Ba-Mei financial agreement has been concluded, the crisis of economic aggression that offsets it can also be eliminated. In the future, the United States and Brazil can also exchange US wheat for Brazilian manganese in the same way as this agreement. As for Brazil's US dollar-denominated foreign debt, the agreement to continue repaying principal and interest can also be satisfied. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Another Internal Change in Czechoslovakia: Slovakia Demands Independence, Key Figures Arrested, Government Reorganized</h3>
<p>Czech Capital: A large-scale disturbance has occurred in Slovakia. The central government army has surrounded the public institutions of the province's capital and has declared martial law.

As for Szedar, the assistant to the central government cabinet and minister of Slovak affairs, he was ordered to remain in his original post. The dispute between the Czech and Slovak peoples has come to an end. Informed sources here recently interpreted it, stating that this measure is to preserve the unity of the Czech and Slovak peoples and has no impact on the agreement previously concluded between the two peoples and the autonomous status of the Slovak people.

<h3>UK's Current Air Force Budget: 12 Times Higher Than Any Previous Year, A Huge Sum of Over £220 Million, 1,750 First-Line Aircraft</h3>
<p>(London) Air Minister Wood detailed the large-scale expansion of the air force in the House of Commons today to meet the defense needs of the British Empire, saying that the current figure is 12 times higher than any year from 1929 to 1934. Wood presented the air force budget, saying that this budget is approximately double the total defense budget for the sea, land, and air forces from 1932 to 1933. This year's air force budget has increased by £74,000,000, which is equal to the entire national defense budget in 1913. Around April 1 this year, there will be 1,750 first-line aircraft. Britain is spending £250,000 per day on aircraft manufacturing this year, and the cost will be even higher thereafter. The largest item in this year's air force budget is the cost of aircraft and anti-aircraft balloons, totaling £93,000,000. The local women's auxiliary corps is currently forming 35 detachments. Wood said that Britain is blocking balloon defenses, and this equipment in London can now be used when needed. He hopes that this equipment can be completed throughout the country by the end of this year. The civilian air defense team currently has more than 1,400 members, all of whom have obtained flight licenses. In addition, there are 3,800 people undergoing flight training. The standard for pilots is now higher than before. There are currently 30 squadrons of the Imperial Air Force stationed overseas, and 7 more squadrons will be formed to meet the goal of increasing overseas air force to 500 first-line aircraft. Britain has always regarded counter-attack as an important factor in its strategy and still attaches importance to its value. A powerful offensive force is not only a tool to prevent enemy attacks, but also a necessary component in enriching air defense. Recent developments have indeed reduced the advantage of attack and focused on sky defense, but this does not mean that we can rely solely on fighter jets and ground defenses to defend against the enemy. Eleven aircraft manufacturing plants established according to the concealment plan have now started construction, and aircraft production has also made great progress. Plants in a group of three or four will manufacture the same aircraft to avoid production interruption due to the shutdown of one plant. In this way, large-scale design and ordering can be facilitated, and the disruption caused by war can be reduced. Aircraft drawings will also be reduced to speed up production. Last November, he estimated that by the end of next year, British aircraft production could increase by 400% compared to the 1938 production. Today, he dares to hope that this goal can be achieved by the end of this year. Although today's air force budget is unprecedented, it is necessary. He firmly believes that this is the best way to prevent war and hopes that the world will realize this and change its course. Wood announced that the current air force budget is £220,626,700, which is unprecedented in the history of the British Air Force. It is noted that the British Air Force budget in 1934 was only around £18,000,000. Wood explained that the huge amount of this year's funding is mostly due to (1) the Air Force's adoption of a large number of new aircraft, (2) the expansion of aircraft manufacturing capacity, (3) the construction of new air stations, (4) the sudden increase in aircraft production, and (5) the unusually enthusiastic response from the people, resulting in the increase of air force personnel to 102,000. The large-scale delivery of fuselages and engines, the accelerated progress of the construction of air stations and aircraft factories, and the implementation of the balloon obstruction plan have all increased the air force budget. This not only indicates the success of Britain's efforts to expand its air force, but also shows that the British people have a full understanding of air defense and the determination to be fully prepared. Aircraft production has increased by 150% compared to last year. Aircraft purchased in the United States are now arriving in Britain one after another, and aircraft ordered in Canada will also begin delivery next year. A British air force delegation is currently in Australia to study the possibility of manufacturing aircraft. The number of workers employed in the British aircraft manufacturing industry has increased by 40% in the past six months. All new aircraft submitted for inspection are extremely qualified, indicating that Britain now has the best aircraft in the world. Last June, he asked the people to apply for pilots, scouts, etc., totaling 31,600 people. This number has already been exceeded last week. There are 1,400 applicants who are physically qualified. He will need 20,000 more people in the coming year. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Britain, Australia, and New Zealand: To Discuss Strengthening Defense</h3>
<p>(London) Informed sources here recently stated that the British government will hold a "Pacific Conference" in the Far East with representatives from the Commonwealth of Australia and the Dominion of New Zealand in the short term. The agenda includes (1) the sea, land, and air defense of the British Dominions in the Pacific, (2) the opening of civil aviation routes, and (3) the issue of army officer training. The British government's attendees will mainly be representatives from the sea, land, and air forces. Among them, General Squires, the representative of the War Office, and Rear Admiral Colvin, the representative of the Admiralty, have already arrived in the Commonwealth of Australia. Since the Dominion of Canada can supply aircraft manufactured by them to the Dominions in the Pacific in the future, just as they supply the British mainland, they may also send personnel to participate in the meeting at that time. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Aviation Minister Wood stated in the House of Commons today that Hong Kong is a part of the British Empire, and Britain hopes that an air force reserve team will be trained there, as well as in Malaya and East Africa. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Last Year’s Purchases from England by China Reached Over £180,000; Committee Holds Annual Meeting</h3>
<p>(London) The Chinese Government Purchasing Commission held its annual meeting this afternoon at the Chinese Embassy. Ambassador Guo Taiqi chaired the meeting, with Chinese Commissioner Wang Jingchun, British Commissioner Weiji Hood, and others in attendance. The atmosphere at the meeting was optimistic. Ambassador Guo congratulated the establishment of the national currency stabilization fund. Although the volume of purchases by the committee decreased significantly due to the war over the past year, it was reported that a total of 74 purchases were made, with a value of £182,034. Of particular interest was the order for £35,000 worth of telephone and telegraph equipment for the development of Southwest China. In the second half of the year, £30,000 worth of railway materials were purchased. The purchase of railway materials needed for the Yunnan-Burma Railway has now begun. Since the committee began purchasing materials in England in 1931, it has purchased a total of £5,266,783. The total operating expenses were £48,439, which translates to operating expenses of 18 shillings and 9 pence per £100 of purchases. The interest income is approximately four times greater than the operating expenses. At the end of the year, the committee had a total of £788,963 in fixed deposits and current accounts. In the past year, the committee has sent Chinese students to British machinery factories and shipyards for internships. (Reuter, 9th)</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops Counterattack Fuyang; Only Over a Hundred Residents Remain in the City</h3>
<p>Fuyang Correspondence: Fuyang City was once recovered by General Liu Jianxu's troops of the Chinese army. Subsequently, a large unit of Japanese troops from Hangzhou reinforced the area, and the Chinese troops withdrew from Fuyang City and defended Zhongzhou, Zhujialing, and other positions. After the Japanese troops occupied Fuyang City, they sent their troops to harass the Yingzhen area. The houses in Fuyang City were reduced to ashes by a large fire. About 1,000 innocent civilians who did not have time to escape were arbitrarily killed and raped by the Japanese troops, and the roads were filled with corpses. Currently, apart from the Japanese troops and puppet officials, only over a hundred residents remain in the entire city, living in extreme misery. Recently, Chinese troops have advanced to Fusha, Zhoujiapu, Dayuanzhen, and the Japanese troops at Huozi Mountain have also been cleared by the Chinese army. The Chinese army's positions have added many air defense works, and County Magistrate Wang has convened various agencies to allocate civilian laborers to actively construct them. The county government's funds are also sufficient, and a joint office system is adopted, with all accounting personnel managed by Director Qin Wenjiang. Hu Jiaxiang was appointed by the provincial government as the director of the county treasury. All political work is proceeding as usual. It is rumored that the vanguard of the Chinese army has reached the suburbs of Fuyang City and is advancing towards the city. The Japanese troops in the city are retreating along the Hangzhou-Fuyang Road towards Yuhang.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shanzi's Works Open at Paris Exhibition</h3>
<p>(Paris) The famous Chinese painter Zhang Shanzi came to France at the invitation of Bishop Yu Bin of the Nanjing Diocese to exhibit his works, in order to raise funds for the relief of refugees in the Chinese war zone. The exhibition opened at the Foreign Art Museum at 3:00 PM today. French Minister of Education Thiaut Johann, Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun, and Archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Verdier, represented the attendees and jointly presided over the opening ceremony. The appreciation of the works is truly rare in the Parisian art world this year. Mr. Zhang is a Catholic and has worked in the Chinese judicial system for many years. His painting style is different from that of ordinary modern Chinese painters. In essence, Mr. Zhang still adheres to the traditional spirit of Chinese painting, unlike other painters who focus on integrating Chinese and Western painting techniques. His painting "Lotus" was once exhibited here in 1933 and has now been purchased by the French government. Mr. Zhang has become particularly famous in recent years for painting tigers. He usually keeps several fierce tigers at home, carefully studies them, and then depicts them on paper, all with lifelike accuracy. His being admired by Parisians is well-deserved. After the end of the art exhibition here, Mr. Zhang will also cross over to America to hold an exhibition in New York. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>Beiping Postal Chief Detained for Over a Month; Platt Returned Safely to Beiping; Ransom of 10,000 Yuan Fully Returned; Platt Praises Guerrilla Discipline</h3>
<p>The "China Press" Beiping correspondent reports: The Beiping Postal Chief, Platt, was detained in the Western Hills for forty days, and suddenly returned to Beiping before the lunar New Year. Platt was arrested on January 8th while picnicking at the Ming Tombs with a friend. On the way to the Ming Tombs, they passed through a small town. The Japanese garrison soldiers there heard that Mr. Platt was going to the Ming Tombs and said that the area around the Ming Tombs was quite safe, but when they arrived and were dining, they were surrounded by armed Chinese, who called Mr. Platt a hateful Japanese who was plundering their country. They blindfolded Mr. Platt and quickly dragged him and his driver into the mountains. Mr. Platt's friend was sent back soon after. That night, Mr. Platt and several other Chinese prisoners were held in a small room. Soon, a man in civilian clothes entered the room to visit Mr. Platt. The man's surname was Liu (transliteration), and he seemed to have some authority. Mr. Platt explained to him that he was not Japanese but Italian. Mr. Liu angrily said that the Italians were also their enemies because they were helping Japan. Mr. Platt further explained that he was a postal worker who had been working for the Chinese government for over thirty years. Mr. Liu slowly said, "If that's the case, you must be a traitor. You were appointed by the National Government, but now you are working for the Japanese." This conversation at least prevented Mr. Platt from being killed as a hateful Japanese. Mr. Platt was then forced to write a note to a friend in Beiping, stating that if a ransom was delivered to a certain village, he would be freed. Mr. Platt's driver was immediately released and returned to Beiping with the note. However, after they directly delivered 10,000 yuan on Tuesday, Mr. Platt was still not released. These guerrillas changed locations every night on the mountain, either living in isolated farmhouses on the hillside or in herdsmen's huts, so the accommodations were very simple. But if possible, they would let Mr. Platt live in a room alone. On the mountain, the sky was already dark by 4:00 PM, and the weather was cold at night. The food was also very poor, only hard-to-swallow porridge and salted vegetables, but this was not because the guerrillas were treating Mr. Platt badly, but because they themselves often had difficulty obtaining supplies. They shared what they ate with the detainees. Once or twice, they treated Mr. Platt with skinny chicks, which he also received from the food sent from Beiping. The Chinese prisoners who were detained were arrested on the plains and accused of being traitors because they or their relatives were indeed working for the Japanese. Those who were proven to be directly traitors were shot. Those who were not directly traitors were released after strict guarantees and the payment of a ransom. The prisoners were interrogated by a special court, presided over by the aforementioned Mr. Liu. Messengers traveled back and forth between the various camps of these guerrillas day and night, so they seemed to have a lot of contact and cooperation with other guerrillas. The clothing of the guerrillas who detained Mr. Platt was quite inconsistent, but many of them wore Japanese army coats, military caps, and were equipped with Japanese army rifles, battlefield telescopes, and trench periscopes. They also maintained a small degree of military discipline, especially when on sentry duty. The sentries' on-duty time was determined by burning a stick of incense. Mr. Platt also heard gunshots not far away several times. On one occasion, the Japanese army came within about a mile, but during the forty days he spent with the guerrillas, he did not see them suffer any casualties. Mr. Platt believes that the people who captured him were not affiliated with the Eighth Route Army, because he did not hear them mention this name. What he heard was that they called themselves guerrillas. After Mr. Platt returned to Beiping, the local newspapers published it in a special and prominent position, and said that the guerrillas had mistreated local residents, but the reporter had met Mr. Platt, and he could not confirm this statement, because the guerrillas had never passed through or stayed in any villages. Furthermore, although the guerrillas lightly demanded food from the farmhouses on the mountain, they definitely paid for it, or would repay it later when they found food elsewhere, and they would repay any surplus. The mountain people also delivered messages for the guerrillas. Finally, the guerrillas suddenly told Mr. Platt that he was free and could leave at will, but Mr. Platt did not leave immediately, but waited for the guerrillas to escort him to Nankou. Before Mr. Platt set off, the guerrillas returned the 10,000 yuan ransom and the camera. When they arrived at Nankou, Mr. Platt said goodbye to the guerrillas and immediately hired a donkey and his loyal groom to rush back to Beiping. For three days on the way, they passed through guerrilla areas and Japanese army defense lines. Because he was carrying a large sum of money, he was afraid of encountering unexpected events again or being considered a spy by the Japanese army, so it was quite dangerous, but he avoided the main roads, highways, and military posts, and managed to return to a safe place. Mr. Platt replied to reporters' inquiries that he did not understand the reason for the return of the ransom. Some say that Wu Peifu intervened to prove his power to the Japanese side. If so, this matter should have been vigorously promoted, but it was kept strictly secret, and this statement was transmitted from a very suspicious source. Some say that the guerrillas acted on the direct orders of the Chinese government. Everyone here knows that the Beixiao Post Office and the Italian Association appealed to the Chinese government to release Mr. Platt several weeks ago, which can be used as supporting evidence for this view. Furthermore, about two weeks before Mr. Platt's release, several parties who had close contact with the Chinese government beforehand claimed that the Chinese government had ordered the release of Mr. Platt, which seems to be the most reasonable explanation.</p>
<h3>Feng Yuxiang Proposes Eliminating the Malpractices of Conscription; Ministry of Military Administration Issues Circular for Compliance</h3>
<p>Ningbo Correspondence: The Ministry of Military Administration recently issued a circular to all division management areas, relaying it to the headquarters of all regimental management areas, stating: "Having received a telegram from Chairman Chiang of the Military Committee, stating that according to a letter from Feng Huanzhang, the malpractices of conscription have not yet been eliminated, and there are many instances of substitution and bribery, which greatly affects the implementation of military service. Many new recruits desert after enlisting, and cannot be recovered. In this situation, on the one hand, local authorities should be instructed to quickly improve the Baojia organization and military service administration, thoroughly investigate, seriously punish, improve the treatment of soldiers, and reduce the suffering of soldiers. On the other hand, efforts should be made to strengthen propaganda work, so that the people understand the importance of today's war of resistance and its relationship to themselves. It is hoped that these instructions will be followed." It is noted that in order to eliminate the malpractices of conscription, prevent desertion of new recruits, improve the treatment of soldiers, and strengthen propaganda work, the Ministry has previously promulgated the "Methods for Drawing Lots for National Conscription," "Methods for Preventing and Handling Desertions in Various Units," "Methods for Soldier Care," and "Outlines for Implementing Conscription During Wartime," etc., and has issued circulars for compliance. Now, in accordance with the aforementioned reasons, in addition to sending a separate letter to the Political Department, it is hoped that these instructions will be followed and relayed to subordinates for strict compliance.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Land at Qixu Port; Both Sides in Stalemate</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: At around 6:00 AM on the 27th of last month, over 200 Japanese troops landed at Qixu Port, which belongs to Taixing County, in small motorboats, with unclear intentions. Chinese troops are closely deployed in the Sixianzhen area, preparing to resist. Both sides are in a stalemate. As of the time the reporter was writing, there had been no contact. However, at 12:30 PM on the same morning, nine Japanese bombers were spotted over the port, flying from the southeast to the northwest. Taixing and Taixian both issued emergency reports, which were lifted at 12:55 PM. At around 1:00 PM in the afternoon, five Japanese transport ships were spotted at Longwokou, heading upstream from downstream. At the same time, there was also a Japanese transport ship and a large motorboat heading downstream from upstream, but neither stopped.</p>
<p>The fort built in front of the Japanese army headquarters in Xiannvmiao, Yangzhou, has not yet been completed. On the morning of the 27th, they continued to forcibly conscript civilian laborers and dismantle the brick walls of the houses north of Tongshi Bridge, transporting them to build the fort. Also, in the Gaomotou area, at around 5:00 AM on the 27th, about 80 to 90 Japanese troops from Shizhuang, together with Japanese troops who arrived from Rugao, came into contact with the Chinese Self-Defense Forces. It stopped at 11:00 AM. As a result, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Northern Jiangsu Fiercely Attack Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: At present, the urban area of Jiangyin has entered a state of terror and chaos, and the Japanese troops are wantonly harassing the vicinity of the city under the guise of "searching," causing innocent people to suffer injustice. The recent guerrilla activities and the suffering of the people in the county are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Fiercely Attack</p>
<p>The total number of the Chinese Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army is no less than 30,000, and they are equipped with some heavy weapons, posing a serious threat to the Japanese troops in the Chengxi area. Commander Yuan Yacheng's unit of over 300 men used light machine guns and rifles to fiercely attack the city under the eastern, southern, and northern walls at around 9:00 PM the day before yesterday. The gunfire was dense for about half an hour, and then they withdrew to their original defenses in formation. At that time, there were about 100 Japanese troops in the city, who lay down at the foot of the walls of the four city gates to avoid being hit by stray bullets. All the major and minor traitors, fearing that the city would be broken and they would be slaughtered, hid in the homes of relatives and friends, and dared not sleep soundly.</p>
<p>Fierce Battle at Zhouzhuang</p>
<p>Zhouzhuang Town, more than ten miles southeast of Jiangyin City, is famous for its cloth production. During the late Ming Dynasty, Yan Yingyuan, the national hero who led the county residents to resist the Qing soldiers for eighty-one days and nights, once lived in seclusion on Shasha Mountain south of the town. The place is known for its spiritual energy and outstanding talents. This time, the Japanese army felt that the strong morale of the people and the loyal and brave guerrillas in Jiangyin were particularly difficult to deal with. In late February, more than 30 Japanese troops went to the town to search, but were detected by the guerrillas, who surrounded Zhouzhuang Town on all sides and advanced to the vicinity of the street, resulting in fierce street fighting. All the guerrilla soldiers fought bravely, bombing forward with hand-held grenades. As a result, several guerrillas were killed in action, and more than ten civilians were wounded or killed, while no more than ten of the Japanese troops survived. Two days later, more than 100 Japanese troops, with several small steel cannons, set out from Jiangyin and planned to search Zhouzhuang again. When they approached the town, they came into direct contact with the guerrillas, and a fierce battle lasted for about five hours. At around 9:00 PM, the guerrillas surrounded the Japanese troops. Then Japanese reinforcements arrived and broke through the encirclement, retreating to the Caojia Village area, about six or seven miles from the city. Both sides suffered casualties. At the end of last month, more than 100 Japanese troops again took 13 small boats from Lujia Bridge, copied the back of Zhouzhuang, and landed on the top of Shasha Mountain, hoping to spy on the guerrillas' situation. After half a day, they gained nothing and left dejectedly.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Harass</p>
<p>Regarding the situation of Japanese troops disturbing the people, according to investigations: (1) On February 20, at around 3:00 AM, several Japanese military policemen went to the Chen family near the Xiaochenghuang Temple in Dongmen, broke into the house, and set it on fire without asking why. They also pushed a lacquer worker (over 50 years old) living in the house into the flames and burned him to death. As a result, two houses were destroyed. It is said that this action of the Japanese army was based on a traitor's false report. (2) On February 22, more than ten Japanese naval soldiers, with small boats, went to the Duanshan Port of Quandong Township along the river. When the Jianglun rowing boats were unloading goods, they boarded the ship and forcibly robbed a cage of live chickens sold by vendors, totaling 120. As a result, merchants were frightened, and travelers were afraid to proceed.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Qingpu Attack the County Seat; Puppet Official Lu Shoupeng Killed</h3>
<p>Qingpu Correspondence: On the morning of the 7th, Qingpu was attacked by more than 100 Japanese and puppet troops from Baihejiang Town in northern Qingpu, led by Lu Shoupeng, the captain of the puppet police brigade, carrying small bronze cannons and light and heavy machine guns, traveling along the Dayingpu River in motorboats. The guerrilla unit of Fei Yiming stationed in the town received the report in advance, and together with Ling's unit from Zhaotun Bridge, cut off their retreat. The Japanese and puppet troops were unprepared and suffered heavy casualties. Seeing the situation was critical, the Japanese troops retreated in motorboats towards the Anqing Highway. Lu Shoupeng, the captain of the puppet police brigade, was also killed by the Chinese army. Fei's unit took advantage of the victory to advance towards the county seat, and engaged in a fierce battle with the Japanese troops stationed there near the Cha'an area, about three Chinese miles outside the north gate. For a time, gunfire erupted. The Japanese troops stationed in Qingpu heard the alarm and immediately set up steel cannons on the city towers to bombard, and after a fierce battle until dusk, two ocean bridges on the Qing'an Highway were destroyed, and they safely withdrew to their original defenses. The Japanese troops immediately conducted house-to-house searches in nearby villages, and many villagers were killed. Young women were all raped. The next morning, Fei Yiming's unit of the Chinese army again rushed into Cha'an. In addition to hastily fighting back, the Japanese troops fled into the city.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attack Haiyan, Use Poison Gas; Chinese Troops Await Opportunity to Counterattack</h3>
<p>Haiyan Correspondence: Since the Haiyan Chinese army base area was attacked by the Japanese troops on three routes on the 24th of last month, the Japanese army has not succeeded and has suffered heavy casualties. Therefore, in the mornings of the day before yesterday and yesterday, a large number of troops were transferred from Shanghai and began a full-scale offensive, with aircraft support. At this time, the officers and soldiers of the various units of the Chinese army were not afraid of the fierce artillery fire and continued to resist, so the positions did not move. Later, because the Japanese army could not win, they indiscriminately used poison gas. Almost all of the advance units of the Chinese army smelled the gas, were poisoned, and shed tears, so the first defense line was broken by the Japanese. The officers and soldiers of the Chinese army then defended the second defense line and continued to fight, eliminating many enemies, but due to the heavy casualties, they abandoned all the strongholds at the same time. Now the Chinese army has retreated to a certain place to concentrate, awaiting the opportunity to counterattack. According to a person who just came from that place, after the Japanese troops occupied Shendang, Ganpu, and Haiyan, they carried out large-scale burning and killing, and forcibly pulled farmers to find women. Then they forcibly forced the people who had not left to help build defensive works at various key points, dig trenches, and build artillery positions and set up sandbags overnight on the Changchuan area, an important road for the Chinese army to source supplies.</p>

<h3>Chen Lijiang Discusses China's Education in the Past Year (Part Two): The Calamities of the Cultural World, Though Unbearable to Recall, Offer Hope for the Revival of New Education in the Future</h3>
<p>Regarding educational theory and thought, regardless of the person, faction, or publication, all consider the Three Principles of the People education as the highest category, with nationalism as the center. This is not merely a verbal assertion; in the practical implementation of education in China over the past year, there have been various innovations and advancements. The government's measures have shown significant reform and progress, and the dynamics of society have also exhibited substantial innovation and progress. Considering the government's measures, we can examine them in several aspects: higher education, secondary education, primary education, social education, frontier education, and others.</p>
<p>(A) Looking at higher education, there have been the following innovations and advancements: (1) "The Establishment of Normal Colleges": The Ministry of Education planned to establish six national normal colleges this year. This is an important measure to cultivate qualified teachers for secondary schools. Last October, the Ministry of Education also convened a National Higher Normal Education Conference, which involved important discussions and decisions on normal education issues. (2) "Adjustment of Departments in Colleges and Universities": Based on the needs of various industries nationwide, the Ministry of Education has made significant adjustments to the departments in various universities. For example, the National Northwest Institute of Technology was established through the merger and reorganization of the engineering colleges of Northwest Associated University, Northeast University, and Jiaozuo Institute of Technology. Yunnan Provincial University was changed to National University, etc. The list is not exhaustive. (3) "Relocation of Colleges and Universities to the Interior": This will have a positive effect on the development of culture in the interior. (4) "Organization of University Courses": Last September, the Ministry of Education published a list of compulsory courses for the colleges of liberal arts, science, and law. The compulsory courses for the colleges of agriculture, industry, and commerce have also been announced. (5) "Implementation of Unified Enrollment for National Colleges and Universities": In the past, each university recruited new students independently, without a rational plan for cultivating talents. Candidates often had to travel long distances, suffering losses in physical health, finances, and mental well-being. Last year, national colleges and universities implemented unified enrollment. (6) Planning for Employment of University Graduates and Relief for Unemployed Secondary School Graduates: In the past, university graduates faced the cry of "graduation equals unemployment." Last year, the Ministry of Education had comprehensive plans for the employment of university graduates, either introducing them to jobs or providing training to ensure that everyone can use their talents to the fullest. Recently, to provide relief to secondary school graduates who applied to universities but were not admitted, or who were unable to participate in entrance examinations for various reasons, the Ministry of Education has also established various specialized courses and university preparatory classes to seek relief. (B) Looking at secondary education, there have been the following innovations and advancements: (1) "The Establishment of Youth Training Outline": This is the most concrete plan for promoting youth training. From now on, there will be a definite basis for training youth. (2) "Continued Establishment and Improvement of National Secondary Schools": For example, adding National Anhui Secondary School, abolishing the school affairs committee of National Secondary Schools, implementing the principal system, etc. (3) "Curriculum Reform": Reducing the original curriculum, improving military training, enriching political education, and implementing wartime rear service are all significant improvements to meet wartime needs. (4) "Pilot Implementation of Student Camps": This is an experiment in new educational methods. (5) "Promotion of Advanced Studies and Training for Secondary School Teachers": For example, the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou all held summer workshops for teachers of various subjects in secondary schools last summer. (6) "Revision of Textbooks": The Textbook Editorial Committee of the Ministry of Education is actively editing or revising supplementary teaching materials for middle schools in extraordinary times, as well as textbooks for junior and senior high school Chinese, history, and geography. (7) "Implementation of the Tutor System": In March of last year, the Ministry of Education promulgated the outline and implementation guidelines for the tutor system in secondary and higher education institutions. All secondary and higher education institutions are making efforts to implement this system, which is an important system for implementing moral education. (8) "Promotion of Vocational Education": Last summer, the Ministry of Education convened teachers from agricultural schools in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces to conduct workshops. More importantly, in order to meet the needs of the Anti-Japanese War, the Ministry of Education also established a mechanical worker training class in Chongqing to train technical personnel.</p>
<p>(C) Looking at primary education, there have been the following innovations and advancements: (1) "Editing of Special Teaching Materials, Supplementary Teaching Materials, and Local Teaching Materials." (2) Holding experimental education training classes. (3) "Editing of Experimental Education Teaching Materials": The Ministry of Education selected special personnel to be responsible for editing. In addition to determining unit activities and selecting new characters and words, they are also editing study guides for existing children's books to facilitate children's free reading.

The provinces of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Guizhou all complied. (5) "Subsidies for Free Education Funds": Last year, the Ministry of Education not only continued to provide subsidies for free education funds but also gave special preference to remote and impoverished provinces. (6) Progress of Compulsory Education: Although compulsory education was in a difficult environment last year, it still progressed greatly according to the original plan.</p>
<p>(D) Looking at social education, there have been the following innovations and advancements: (1) "The Creation of a Social Education Supervision System": In the past, there was no one specifically responsible for social education supervision. Starting this year, the Ministry of Education has set up social education supervisors in the ministry, held social education supervisor training classes, and formulated social education supervision methods, which were circulated to all provinces for compliance. (2) "Promotion of Remedial Education for the Illiterate Masses in Wartime": In addition to issuing notices to all provinces to comply, the Ministry of Education has successively carried out large-scale promotions in Wuhan, Chongqing, Chengdu, Guiyang, Kunming, Lanzhou, and other places, mobilizing intellectuals and implementing compulsory enrollment. (3) "Improving and Editing Mass Readings" to meet the needs of civilian schools in wartime. At the same time, they are very active in editing popular series for the masses during extraordinary times. (4) "Advancement of Library Undertakings": Such as preparing to build a central library branch in Chongqing to develop library undertakings in the southwest. (5) "Promotion of Film Education": In addition to supplying films to national screening areas as usual, they also ordered itinerant teaching groups to go deep into the countryside to show anti-Japanese films. At the same time, they also produced educational films, reduced-scale anti-Japanese films, and opened training classes for electro-educational personnel to promote film education. (6) "Promotion of Broadcasting Education": This year, in addition to broadcasting lectures on the "Central Radio Station" in Sichuan Province, personnel were also sent to broadcast on the "Changsha Radio Station." In addition to uniformly changing the content of broadcasting to wartime materials, youth self-study broadcasting lectures were also added. (7) "Promotion of Art Education": Drama is most touching. In addition to adding training classes to the National Drama School this year, the Ministry of Education organized three itinerant drama teams to perform in the countryside. Music is also deeply touching. The Ministry of Education specially established a Music Education Committee to compile and review songs and organized experimental itinerant singing groups to tour the southwestern provinces, organizing music groups on the spot. (8) "Promotion of Schools Running Social Education Concurrently": Last year, the Ministry of Education specially formulated measures for schools to run social education concurrently and issued notices to all levels of schools in the country to comply. (9) Promotion of Family Education: Recently, the Ministry of Education has also formulated measures for secondary and primary schools to promote family education and issued notices to all secondary and primary schools across the country to comply with.</p>
<p>(E) Looking at frontier education, there have also been the following innovations and advancements: (1) "Improvement of Mongolian and Hui Schools": In June and July of last year, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to Gansu and Qinghai provinces for inspection. In September, they sent personnel to Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai provinces for inspection to guide the improvement of Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan schools on the ground. (2) "Designating Schools to Add Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan Languages": The Ministry of Education has issued a notice to border provinces to designate several secondary schools to add Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan languages and plans to designate Central University, Zhongshan University, and other universities to add elective courses in Mongolian, Hui, and Tibetan languages. (3) "Increasing Frontier Education Subsidies": In order to develop frontier education, the Ministry of Education has specially allocated surplus funds from previous years to Xinjiang, Xikang, and other provinces and plans to increase them again in the future. (4) "Training Frontier Teachers": The Tibetan and Hui Normal Class attached to the Lanzhou Rural Normal School in Gansu was reorganized into a special normal school, and the Tibetan Teacher Class of the Kangding Normal School in Xikang was reorganized into a special teacher training class to actively train frontier teachers. (5) "Convening a Frontier Education Conference": Recently, the Ministry of Education convened a Frontier Education Conference to discuss issues related to promoting frontier education.

Both sides went all out to compete. After the contact, Paramount took the lead with seven to two. After that, Paramount's score rose sharply, and Mailingjin only regained three goals. In the first half, Paramount led remotely with 23 to 9. After switching sides, Mailingjin suddenly increased by nine points, chasing to 20 to 27. Mailingjin was only seven points behind.

<h3>Charity Football: Tung Wah vs. Portugal, Held Tomorrow Morning Rain or Shine, Chen Hongguang Will Play as Defender, French Army Band Will Perform to Help</h3>
<p>The third charity football match, organized by the Shanghai International Relief Association and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, will be held by the Portuguese team against Tung Wah at Yiyuan at 10:30 tomorrow morning. Because it is related to disaster relief, even if it rains, it will not be postponed and will still be played on time. At that time, more than 30 members of the French Army Band will participate in the performance to help. After the game, the third football will be auctioned off. It is found that the first one was auctioned off by Mr. Gao Huaide for 400 yuan, and the second one was auctioned off by Mr. Pu Zaiyuan for 500 yuan. I don't know who the third ball will fall into the hands of. The lineup of Tung Wah will be slightly changed tomorrow, and Chen Hongguang will play as a defender. The record is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Dayun Zhuang Youren Chen Hongguang Xu Chengdong Ji Shengsen Jiang Zhaoxiang Wan Jin Wan Xianghua Sun Huizhang Dai Linjing Shen Shiyan Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Public Announcement of Second Game Revenue and Expenditure: The revenue and expenditure of the previous second charity game (British Army United vs. Lido) of the Association has been calculated and announced by the International Relief Association and the Western Football Association as follows:</p>
<p>Revenue: 1,147 tickets of 1 yuan each, totaling 1,147 yuan, 2,121 tickets of 50 cents each, totaling 1,103 yuan, proceeds from the football auction (auctioned by Mr. Pu Zaiyuan), totaling 500 yuan, totaling 2,752 yuan in national currency</p>
<p>Expenditure: 10% donation to the French Concession Bureau, totaling 225 yuan and 20 cents</p>
<p>Miscellaneous expenses of Yiyuan (six items), totaling 252 yuan and 10 cents, police duty expenses, totaling 72 yuan</p>
<p>Expenses for Jewish refugees (25%), totaling 550 yuan and 70 cents</p>
<p>Expenses for Chinese refugees (75%), totaling 1,652 yuan</p>
<p>Totaling 2,752 yuan in national currency, the net expenses for Chinese refugees were 1,652 yuan, and the expenses for Jewish refugees were 550 yuan and 70 cents. The income from the second game was far less than that of the first game, partly due to the rain and partly because the game time was on Sunday morning, so only 3,357 tickets of 50 cents and 1 yuan were sold (according to the March 2nd edition of this newspaper, the first game was 9,365 tickets). This third game will also encounter rainy days, so enthusiastic relief workers are quite worried, but I hope that people from all walks of life can bravely watch the game to help the refugees.

<h3>Chinese and Western Cross-Country Race Held Tomorrow Morning, Starting in Front of French Park with a Total of Eight Teams Participating</h3>
<p>The first ten-mile Chinese and Western Open Group Cross-Country Championship, initiated and organized by the Sports Association of the British and French Army stationed in Shanghai, will be held in front of the French Park on Luban Road at 8:00 tomorrow morning, rain or shine. A total of eight teams will participate in the competition, with ten people on each team. The top eight will be selected. There are four individual participants, including athletes from China, Britain, and France. Participating athletes must register at 7:30. As for the strongest teams, Lido should be recommended. It has Wang Zhenglin, Zhang Liang, Ling Xuewen, Cao Shizhang, etc. The second is Huizhen, which also has Liu Guangfa, Li Duan, Xu Peishun, Lin Guoyou, etc. It is expected that the championship will be contested by Lido and Huizhen. According to the generals of Huizhen, taking advantage of the double championship in the Chinese and Western seven-mile race, they are ambitious and will definitely be able to compete with Lido. However, both team lists have the name of Li Duan, and I don't know how Li will divide himself. Dongsailai's strength is slightly inferior and can win the third place, but its experience is rich, and there may be upsets at that time. As for the fourth place, the French Army and Hongkou and Xifusi are vying for it. Other teams such as Youqiang and Hualian have mediocre talents and may be difficult to achieve anything. The full list of athletes is as follows:</p>
<p>(Lido) Wang Zhenglin, Zhang Liang, Ling Xuewen, Ai Youwen, Li Duan, Guan Shizhang Zhou Ruquan, Shen Jishun, Wu Xuecheng, Jing Qiangshi, (Hongkou) Wan Jinsheng, Chen Zixiang, Huang Cangguan, Jiang Jun, Chen Sihao, Tian Shuitang, Huang Wuyuan, Gu Qiming, Zhang Quanfa, Shen Cilin,</p>

<h3>After Successfully Securing a Loan of £10 Million: Establishment of a Management Committee, Designated Use to Stabilize the Value of Legal Tender, Subscription of the Loan by the Four Banks, Funds Deposited in the UK</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the credit of legal tender, stabilize foreign exchange, facilitate commercial transactions, and make exchange rates reasonable and stable, our government has secured a loan of £10 million from four banks, HSBC, McCallum, China, and Jiaotong, to serve as an exchange rate stabilization fund. A fund management committee has been established. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Distribution Method: The distribution method for the £10 million loan from the four banks is as follows: (1) HSBC, £3 million; (2) McCallum Bank, £2 million; (3) China and Jiaotong Banks, jointly responsible for £5 million. The term is temporarily set at twelve months, with an annual interest rate of 5.5%. The designated use of the loan is to maintain the stability of the value of legal tender and shall not be used for other purposes. The funds are deposited in the British banking industry.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Committee: It has been decided to establish a fund management committee for this loan. HSBC, McCallum, China, and Jiaotong Banks will each send one representative to be a member of the committee. The Ministry of Finance of our government and the Ministry of Finance of the British government will each send one representative to be a member of the committee. It is heard that the general headquarters will be established in London, England, and an office will be established in Hong Kong. The committee will be announced after the representatives of each bank and the government are appointed.</p>
<h3>Negotiations for the Return of Dredging Bureau Vessels Seized; It is Heard That the Two Sides are Close to Reaching a Conclusion Soon</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dredging Bureau's various dredgers, survey vessels, and passenger launches, totaling more than twenty vessels of all sizes, were forcibly seized by the Japanese side.  More than a year has passed since then, and they have not yet been returned. Consequently, dredging operations in various sections of the Huangpu River, the lower reaches of the Wusong River, and the Shentan sandbar outside the Wusong estuary have all been suspended.  Silt and sand drift with the currents, causing previous dredging work to be completely undone, and the degree of siltation is even worse than before dredging. This poses a significant hazard to navigation. As for the seized vessels, except for the "Jianshe" dredger, which remains moored on the Huangpu River near Yangshupu after being seized, all other vessels have been forcibly requisitioned for use in places such as Gaoqiao. Furthermore, Japanese puppet (Manchukuo) personnel have been dispatched to carry out dredging, usurping authority, which is extremely dissatisfying to various foreign shipping companies. Because the nature of the Dredging Bureau is international, its shipbuilding and all related expenses are derived from the dredging fees levied by the Customs from various foreign ships. Once dredging stops, the waterway is bound to be obstructed, and the rights and interests of third-country shipping merchants will be harmed.  For this reason, the Inspector General of Customs and the Commissioner of Customs of the Jianghai Customs have repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side for the return of the seized vessels and the resumption of dredging.  However, these negotiations have been ineffective. The crux of the matter is that the Japanese side also uses the Customs' employment of Japanese staff as an example, and demands that the Dredging Bureau must add Japanese staff as a condition. This matter is extremely unacceptable to the Bureau. However, it is now heard that negotiations are being re-initiated and are closer than before. It is generally believed that a conclusion can be reached soon.</p>
<h3>The "Hiliotomo" Has Not Yet Been Returned; The Greek Consul Is Determined to Negotiate Forcefully</h3>
<p>The Greek merchant ship "Hiliotomo," chartered by the Norwegian trading company "Hua Lun Yang Hang" at Wuma Road and Sichuan Road in this city, arrived in Shanghai on the 2nd of this month, carrying general merchandise from Tianjin.  Just as it was about to dock at the Longmao Warehouse in Pudong after entering the port, it was suddenly seized by the Japanese Navy and forced to sail to the center of the river at the Yangshupu Bridge and anchor, and was not allowed to unload cargo.  After the incident, the Greek Consul General in Shanghai lodged a protest with the Japanese side, demanding its immediate release.  However, the Japanese side falsely claimed that the ship's nationality was unclear and that it would be returned only after verifying that it was indeed a Greek merchant ship.  According to news from shipping circles, the "Hiliotomo" is indeed owned by Greek merchants, and the consulate has records to prove it. Since the Japanese side seized the ship, although they have falsely claimed to be investigating its nationality, they have not done so. The ship is still being detained and has not been released. It is heard that the Greek Consul is determined to make another forceful negotiation to protect the interests of Greek merchants.</p>
<h3>Five Types of Government Bonds Including "Unified" Were Drawn Yesterday for Principal Redemption; Payment Methods for Principal and Interest Will Be Announced by the Ministry Upon Maturity; Payment for "Unified" by the End of July, the Rest by the End of March</h3>
<p>Although the Ministry of Finance has announced the method of repaying debts with customs duties in the future, in order to maintain creditworthiness, it has decided to continue making advance payments for principal and interest on domestic debts. Five types of government bonds, including "Unified Class B," "Long-Term Financial," "Telecommunications," "Reorganization of Guangdong Finance," and "Dredging of Guangdong Port and River Projects," were drawn yesterday morning at 10:00 AM at the Bankers' Association on Hong Kong Road for principal redemption.

<h3>1939 Shanghai Municipal Council Budget; Revenue Falls Short by More Than Two Million; Special Expenditures Exceed Last Year; Additional Donations Can Yield More Than One Million Within Half a Year</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's total budget for this year, along with the opinion letter from the Council's Director of Finance, has been reviewed and completed by the Finance Committee at its meeting on the 3rd of this month. According to the draft budget, the total regular income is 27,246,750 yuan, of which 2,272,370 yuan has been allocated to the education budget. The remaining amount, due to the estimated increase in various taxes and fees, is 335,450 yuan, leaving a net surplus of 25,309,830 yuan after deducting the education expenses. The initial draft budget for various regular expenditures (excluding education expenses) totaled 28,901,237 yuan. Before the various committees considered the budget, this number was reduced to 28,827,450 yuan. Subsequently, as a result of discussions among the heads of various departments, it was further reduced by 290,770 yuan. The surplus of 280,000 yuan from the Shanghai account for the purchase and sale of foreign rice was reallocated as funds for refugee relief. Thus, the total expenditures, excluding education expenses, amounted to 28,256,680 yuan. The above-mentioned income and expenditures offset each other, resulting in a net deficit of 2,946,850 yuan. In order to make up for this deficit, the Director of Finance suggested that, starting from July 1 of this year, the general municipal tax and the special municipal tax should each be increased by 2%, and the land tax should also be increased by the same proportion from the same date. The increased taxes and fees could generate approximately 1,250,000 yuan within half a year. As for the remaining deficit in the budget, it could be carried over to the next year's budget or made up for by other methods. The Director of Finance said that the amount of donations and subsidies given by the Council had not yet been determined when the budget was being prepared, and the effects of the recommendations made by the committee discussing the salaries and benefits of the staff had not been taken into account. Due to these two reasons, the budget still needed to be adjusted further. The Director also said that the calculation of foreign exchange rates was based on a ratio of 1 yuan in national currency to 8.5 pence in British gold. As for the special expenditures of various departments, the initial draft totaled 2,547,630 yuan. Some of these expenditures were deemed unnecessary by the various committees during the discussion of the draft and were removed. However, a supplementary budget was used to replace them. The total expenditures removed amounted to 755,600 yuan, and the supplementary budget totaled 32,500 yuan. Thus, the total special expenditures were 1,824,530 yuan, exceeding the expenditures of the previous year by 347,260 yuan. The Director of Finance said that a separate report would be made on the balancing of the special expenditure budget in due course.</p>
<p>The tax schedule applicable to this year was also considered by the Finance Committee on the 3rd of this month. The committee's recommendations are as follows: (1) Land Tax: From January 1 to June 30 of this year, land in the Public Concession will be taxed at a rate of 8 per thousand based on the assessed value. From July 1 of this year until the next annual meeting of taxpayers, the tax rate will be changed to 9 per thousand. This land tax will be prepaid by the land renter every six months. (2) General Municipal Tax: For houses in the Public Concession, a tax of 16% will be levied on the assessed rental value from April 1 to June 30 of this year. From July 1 of this year until the next annual meeting of taxpayers, a tax of 18% will be levied. This house tax will be prepaid by the resident every quarter. (3) Special Tax: For houses outside the Public Concession whose residents enjoy the convenience of various facilities and public services in the Concession, a tax of 14% will be levied on the assessed rental value from April 1 to June 30 of this year. From July 1 of this year until the next annual meeting of taxpayers, a tax of 16% will be levied, prepaid by the resident every quarter. On the 8th of this month, the Council Board of Directors resolved to approve the above-mentioned regular expenditure budget and tax schedule as proposed by the Finance Committee, but the additional donation provision was changed to take effect from October 1. The Director of Finance of the Municipal Council reported that the Council's accounts for the year 1938 were being audited. In summary, the total income (before deducting education expenses) was actually 24,742,403 yuan, an increase of 2,542,723 yuan compared to the budgeted income. The total expenditures were 26,602,647 yuan, exceeding the budget by 1,760,027 yuan. The two offset each other, resulting in a net deficit of 1,860,244 yuan, a reduction of 782,696 yuan compared to the budgeted deficit. According to the Director of Finance, the main reason for the increase in income was that the tax collection performance in the Northeast and Northwest districts was better than budgeted, and the number of vacant houses south of the Suzhou River was fewer than expected, and various licensed businesses were expanding. The difference between the budgeted and actual income for each item is listed below: Land Tax (more than budgeted, same below) 107,407 yuan, General Municipal Tax 1,222,119 yuan, Special Tax 179,862 yuan, License Fees 395,881 yuan, Public and Municipal Enterprise Income 338,979 yuan, Other Income 280,759 yuan, Education Fee Miscellaneous Income 17,716 yuan. As for the expenditures of various departments, except for donations, subsidies, and the expenses of the Public Works Department, they all exceeded the budget by a considerable amount. The main reason was the sharp drop in exchange rates in the second half of last year (the exchange rate when the budget was prepared last year was 1 shilling and 2 and 3/8 pence). Observing the exchange subsidies for pensions, retirement savings, and other retirement benefits, which accounted for almost all of the additional expenditures in the general category of 1,109,238 yuan, the impact of the soaring exchange rates is evident.</p>
<h3>More Than 10,000 Japanese Soldiers in China Mutiny Against War; They Destroyed Weapons and Refused to Land; They Were Detained at Tanggu and Sent Back to Their Home Country</h3>
<p>According to a businessman from Tianjin who spoke to a reporter from the Modern News Agency yesterday, at the end of February, three Japanese transport ships carrying approximately 10,000 Japanese soldiers departed from Dalian. When they arrived at the Tanggu port, the Japanese soldiers on board refused to disembark and destroyed some of the weapons they were carrying. The order was chaotic. Although suppressed by high-ranking Japanese officers, the Japanese soldiers disobeyed orders, acted freely, and chanted anti-war slogans. Later, nearby Japanese warships arrived after hearing the news to suppress the situation and escorted the Japanese soldiers on the three ships back to their home country under surveillance. According to the businessman, he was in Tanggu at the time to purchase goods and witnessed the incident. The local people were panicked, and every household closed their doors. However, all newspapers in North China are run by the Japanese puppets, so there was not a single word about this unfavorable news, and people were forbidden to discuss it. Furthermore, incidents of Japanese soldiers stationed in various regions of North China committing suicide out of war-weariness also occurred from time to time.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Express Grief Over the Municipal Council's Tax Increase; The Increased Revenue is Only Enough for Salary Increases; The Public Does Not Benefit from the Prosperity of the Market</h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily" stated that, regarding the resolution of the Municipal Council to increase the tax rate from 16% to 18%, taxpayers in the Public Concession will not mount an organized resistance to this. The reporter conducted a wide-ranging investigation yesterday (the 9th) and learned that although the majority of taxpayers do not approve of the tax increase, they also have no intention of opposing it. Foreigners in the Public Concession pay little attention to this news. However, Chinese taxpayers in the Public Concession, who are most affected, lament the tax increase. Furthermore, Japanese residents north of the Suzhou River also severely criticized this resolution. However, it is certain that Chinese taxpayers will not take any action to argue with the tax increase. A spokesperson for the association claimed that the Municipal Council is finding it difficult to balance its income and expenditures, so Chinese residents do not want to make things more difficult for the authorities. However, Chinese taxpayers also mentioned the salary increases for senior Municipal Council staff, firmly asserting that the senior staff of the Municipal Council should bear some responsibility for the necessity of the tax increase. This time, the tax increase will increase the Municipal Council's revenue by 1.25 million yuan per year, while the salary increases for senior staff will increase the Council's expenditures by 1 million yuan per year. Therefore, the tax increase is tantamount to filling the private pockets of the salaried employees. Furthermore, according to criticisms from various Chinese circles, the Municipal Council must have believed that the increased income of stores due to the prosperity of Shanghai's commerce would offset the tax increase. However, the Council does not know that the so-called prosperity does not benefit the public, especially the majority of Chinese taxpayers. Only large merchants and property owners benefit.</p>
<h3>The Bean and Rice Industry Holds a Management Meeting; Earnest Admonishment Not to Hoard or Speculate; Hoping That Merchants Will Resume Transportation</h3>
<p>Regarding the city's food supply problem, since rice and grain from producing areas have been transported elsewhere by the Japanese puppets, the amount coming to Shanghai has decreased, causing prices to rise steadily and affecting the people's food supply. The Bean and Rice Industry Association has already resolved to strictly enforce price limits and not exceed them. The association believes that the prevailing trend of large households absorbing grain is seriously affecting the future of the people's food supply. Therefore, at 9:00 AM yesterday, it resumed holding the Market Management Committee meeting, chaired by Fu Qian'geng. It was resolved that each bean and rice firm should be earnestly admonished to share the difficulties of the times, not to hoard, not to speculate, not to manipulate, and to unanimously implement the association's resolution to maintain the price limit of 14 yuan, and to hope that merchants will purchase and transport grain from the producing areas as usual in order to enrich the source of food for the people.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Compatriot Association Decides to Purchase Foreign Rice; A Total of 100,000 Stones; Telegram Sent to the Ministry Requesting Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Shanghai Compatriot Association planned to purchase rice in Shanghai and transport it to Ningbo in preparation for the spring famine. However, it failed because the Shanghai Jianghai Customs prohibited the export of rice. Recently, according to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, the Ningbo Compatriot Association has now sent a letter to the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce, soliciting a joint request to the Ministry of Finance for foreign exchange to purchase 100,000 stones of foreign rice, and will submit a joint request to the Ministry of Finance as soon as the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce agrees, in order to alleviate the people's food supply.</p>
<h3>New Terrorist Incidents Occur in the Hongkou Area; Terrorists Change Tactics, Committing Arson Everywhere in the Quiet of the Night</h3>
<p>The "terrorist" incidents in the Concession area have subsided as a result of the Municipal Council's efforts. However, new "terrorist" incidents are becoming active again in the Hudong area of the Hongkou district. Recently, terrorists in the Yangshupu district have been spreading throughout the back streets and alleys, and even hiding in empty houses. Every night, when people are sound asleep, they sneak out and commit arson, almost every night. These so-called "terrorist" incidents occur in areas governed by the Japanese side, making it difficult for the Japanese side to prevent them.</p>

<h3>The Prohibition of Using Legal Tender in North China Does Not Harm the Financial Market; Exchange Rates Are Smooth; All Inter-Bank Transfers Are in Legal Tender; All Banks Refuse to Accept "Lianquan"</h3>
<p>Since the puppet government of North China prohibited the use of legal tender starting today, the issuance of legal tender in North China has increased unabated because the people deeply believe in legal tender and are happy to collect it. Shanghai banks have long been prepared and the financial market is unaffected. Exchange rates are smooth, and all inter-bank transfers are in legal tender. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Promoting Lianquan by Prohibiting Legal Tender: After the "United Reserve Bank" of puppet North China failed to exchange legal tender and obtain foreign exchange by issuing banknotes, it forced the devaluation of legal tender in North China, and the puppet "North China Government" ordered the prohibition of legal tender circulation starting from March 11, all to promote the issuance of its "Lianquan". It also stipulated two zones: the "Lianquan Zone" and the "War Zone". The "Lianquan Zone" includes Beijing, Tianjin, Qingdao, Jinan, Taiyuan, Yantai, Shanhaiguan, Shijiazhuang, Tangshan, Linfen, Xinxiang, and other places, where the use of legal tender is prohibited and the use of "Lianquan" is forced. The "War Zone," which is controlled by guerrillas and cannot be reached by Japanese puppet troops, still uses legal tender as usual and cannot be prohibited.</p>
<p>People Collect More Legal Tender: Although the circulation of legal tender in North China has been repeatedly sabotaged by the Japanese puppets, such as forcibly devaluing it and prohibiting its use, the people of North China are happy to collect it because the legal tender is well-prepared. As for the puppet banknotes, they are paid out as soon as they are received. Thus, in places like Tianjin in North China, not only is it not used at a discount, but there is also an additional 20 to 30 yuan per thousand yuan, which proves that the value of legal tender is above "Lianquan." The issuance of legal tender in North China has increased unabated. As of February 18 this year, the Bank of China had 162,233,100 yuan, the Bank of Communications had 78,500,000 yuan, the Central Bank had 36,559,905 yuan, and the China South Bank, China Industrial Bank, Agricultural and Industrial Bank, Reclamation Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, etc., had 4,860,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai Finance Unaffected: A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the prohibition of legal tender circulation in North China has absolutely no impact on the Shanghai financial market, because Shanghai banks have long been prepared. After that, legal tender will still circulate as usual in the concessions of Tianjin in North China and in the guerrilla areas, and all receipts and payments will be in legal tender. Therefore, the puppet "North China Government's" prohibition of legal tender circulation is of no help in fact. The exchange between banks and various places in North China is still smooth, and inter-bank transfers are still in legal tender. Shanghai banks uniformly refuse to accept "Lianquan." However, Chinese banks in North China, Beijing, and other places are facing sharp declines in business due to the oppression of the Japanese puppets.</p>
<p>Full Exercise Without Doubt: Even if the legal tender issued by our Tianjin Bank of China and Bank of Communications is forcibly stopped from circulating in the occupied areas after March 11, it will still be able to fully exercise in the embassy circles in Beijing, the Tianjin concession area, and the inland villages, because the exchange rate with foreign currency remains stable and the people's confidence is increasing day by day. Moreover, all international commercial payments and receipts, and the buying and selling of agricultural and industrial products, use our legal tender as the means of payment and receipt. The successful loan of 10 million pounds this time has made the value of legal tender more stable and consolidated, and Chinese and foreign people have increased their belief in our country's legal tender, so the financial community does not pay attention to the prohibition of legal tender in North China.</p>
<h3>Unemployment Statistics for Shanghai Workers; The Total is Approximately 300,000; People from All Regions are Included</h3>
<p>The Shanghai "Times" stated yesterday (the 9th) that, according to statistics from the China Section of the International Labor Office in Geneva, there are currently 300,000 unemployed male and female workers in Shanghai. Unemployment is a common occurrence in any major city, but before the outbreak of the Shanghai War in 1937, Shanghai was known as the "colony of the unemployed." Shanghai has a total number of White Russian immigrants, which has increased due to the arrival of new White Russians from Harbin. The Hongkou district also has Japanese, and their unemployment rate is also high. In addition, there are countless unemployed Chinese who previously worked around the Shanghai concessions. Recently, several thousand unfortunate European Jews have arrived with their families, so the number of unemployed of various nationalities has increased again. The Chicken People's District in Nanshi also accommodates thousands of refugees, and it is heard that many Chinese who have withdrawn from Hankou, Guangzhou, and other places have gone to Shanghai. Some of them stay in Shanghai, while others, seeing that it is difficult to make a living and that the cost of living in Shanghai is quite high, immediately go elsewhere to seek a livelihood. This situation has reached a focal point, and Chinese and foreign stores have resumed large-scale cost-cutting, and many people will lose their jobs as a result. Although everyone agrees that times are bad, at the end of last year, the local commercial and trade situation was still fairly satisfactory. Many major department stores made substantial profits, and it is heard that one or two of them earned as much as 6 million yuan. The majority of Chinese banks and money shops also made substantial profits. Although a small number of Chinese stores voluntarily liquidated, very few were forced to close. However, well-informed business circles in Shanghai expect that the local commercial situation will not return to its pre-war state without a long period of time. Of the 800,000 unemployed male and female workers in 1937, approximately 500,000 have found work in Chinese factories that have recently opened in the Public Concession. If this statistic of reduced unemployment is indeed true, then the status of the local industry seems to be better than before.</p>
<h3>Foreign Shipments of Rice and Grain Refused Visas by Japanese Authorities: Inland River Companies Exclusively Control Yangtze River Shipping; Ports Such as Baimao and Yanglin to be Blockaded</h3>
<p>Regarding the Japanese control of Yangtze River shipping and the squeezing of foreign business interests, active progress has been made and is gradually becoming concrete. The existing foreign ships operating at various ports are being subjected to extreme difficulties, and the issuance of procurement certificates is being refused. It is reported that ports such as Liuhe, Qiyakou, Hupu, and Changyinsha will be served by vessels of inland river companies, which are essentially disguised subsidiaries of the Nisshin Shipping Company. Other ports are being blockaded. The following is a report from a reporter of the Xiandai News Agency on the situation:</p>
<p>Foreign Ships Loading Cargo Refused Visas: The Japanese are extremely hostile towards foreign ships operating on the Yangtze River. They are using special violence to arbitrarily inspect passengers and goods at various ports, causing significant losses to foreign businesses. Unexpectedly, since March, the Japanese authorities have implemented a goods import and export procurement certificate system, resorting to extreme obstructionist tactics. The British firm Jardine Matheson's Tonghe Shipping Company, which was scheduled to sail to Hupu last week to load rice and grain for Shanghai, was refused a procurement certificate by the Japanese authorities. Therefore, the vessel remains anchored outside the port, and negotiations are underway with the local garrison. Similarly, the German firm Reiss &amp; Co.'s Jiangding, the Qianxin Shipping Company's Kaisteng, and the Changfeng Shipping Company's Xin Jiangnan are only permitted to carry passengers and a small amount of cargo but are not allowed to load rice and grain, cotton, etc. In addition, the Yita Shipping Company's Alexander, which operates to Changyinsha, Hupu, and other ports, is also prohibited from loading cargo.</p>
<p>Inland River Companies Take Over Navigation: Regarding the future of shipping on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, it will be served by vessels of the Jiangzhe Inland River Shipping Company, an affiliated organization of the Nisshin Shipping Company. Earlier this month, Asano, a Japanese representative of the company, visited various ports on the southern bank of the Yangtze River and, after visiting Takahashi, the garrison commander of Changshu, Taicang, and Jiangyin, began consulting with the puppet organizations of each county to discuss navigation methods. It is expected that this will be realized within this month. It is also understood that the company has made arrangements for inland river shipping (operating in the Suzhou Creek area), establishing a transport hub in Kunshan. Subsequently, foreign small ships will be excluded by the company. It is reported that foreign firms have decided to strive together to protect their interests in China.</p>
<p>Jiangnan Ports to be Blockaded: According to sources in the shipping industry contacted by the Xiandai reporter, the Japanese authorities will implement a blockade of various ports on the southern bank of the Yangtze River, such as Xiaochuansha (under Baoshan County), Yanglin and Dangqi (under Taicang County), and Baimao and Fushan (under Changshu County). In the future, only the four ports of Liuhe, Qiyakou, Hupu, and Changyinsha will be open.</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Solely Resumes Navigation on Lower Yangtze River: Japanese Merchant Ships with Blackened Funnels Operated by Yuyun Shipping Company</h3>
<p>The shipping rights of foreign shipping companies on the Yangtze River have not been restored since the Japanese authorities forcibly closed the river under the pretext of military operations. Despite repeated strong protests, no results have been achieved, causing significant losses to the various companies. It is reported that the Japanese have now independently resumed navigation from Jiangyin upstream to Hankou, sending vessels to carry passengers and goods, and the business is quite developed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Initially Reopened Jiangyin Route: On the Yangtze River, the Japanese authorities first independently reopened the Shanghai-Jiangyin route last year, deploying the Japanese vessel Haimen Maru, which travels back and forth. The funnel has been painted black, ostensibly acting as a transport ship, making a round trip every four days, with one sailing from Shanghai every four days, docking at the Weisaigong Wharf in Pudong. Each trip is mostly passengers, with fewer goods.</p>
<p>Then Reopened Wuhan Route: After the opening of Wuhan, the Japanese authorities have further independently opened the Shanghai-Hankou route, dispatching the Rokuchi Maru and Naruto Maru (both owned by the Osaka Company), with blackened funnels, still resembling transport ships in appearance, but actually carrying both passengers and goods. They also call at Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Datong, Anqing, Jiujiang, Wuxue, Huangshi Port, and other ports. Passenger traffic is also dominant, as inland traffic has not yet recovered, so there are very few goods. The vessels dock at the Osaka Wharf in Pudong, Shanghai, departing approximately every seven days (because navigation is not possible at night in several sections of the river, each round trip takes fourteen days).</p>
<h3>Commander of the 17th Army Corps Commends Boy Scouts: Du Yuesheng and Wang Xiaolai Also Send Telegrams of Condolence</h3>
<p>The Boy Scouts of the 50th Regiment of this city have been handling rescue work with the army and have achieved remarkable results. Recently, the headquarters of the 7th Army Corps specially issued a commendation order, stating, "After investigating, this regiment has worked diligently and its records are detailed, which is highly commendable and should be commended by order. Let this be known." In addition, the regimental affairs committee also sent a telegram of condolence, stating, "Your telegram and winter letter are received. We are deeply saddened by the death of troop member Cang Chengquan in Guizhou due to illness contracted in the line of duty. We are also deeply concerned about the injuries and illnesses of troop members Zhang Desun, Xu Defu, Li Bingkui, and Wang Shouchun due to overwork. Please convey our condolences to the family of troop member Cang, and extend our condolences to each of the other members. Upon the final victory, this committee will submit a request for awards to be conferred separately to commend their efforts." Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Jin Runyang, sincerely.</p>

<h3>Guerrilla Unit of Fan Min Recovers Key Town of Nanqiao: More Than 40 Japanese Officers and Soldiers Killed; Both Sides are Deploying for Fierce Fighting</h3>
<p>The Fan Min guerrilla unit, which is lying low in the Qianjiaqiao area of Songjiang, received a tip-off that a large contingent of Japanese troops had arrived in Nanqiao. Fan led all his warriors in a surprise attack the night before last (the 7th), taking the Japanese troops completely by surprise. The Japanese troops scrambled to prepare for battle. After less than an hour of fighting, the Japanese troops were unable to withstand the assault and fled in disarray. The guerrillas killed one Japanese unit commander, Nakajima, and more than 40 soldiers. The Fan unit suffered two warrior deaths and three wounded, with no other losses. The unit captured many light and heavy machine guns, ammunition, and weapons, and Nanqiao was recovered by Fan. It is now reported that the Japanese troops are mobilizing reinforcements, and the Fan unit has also made comprehensive deployments, preparing to fight the Japanese troops to the death.</p>
<p>Fighting at Bailianjing: Since the restoration of smooth passage through various ferry crossings such as Zhoujiadu and Nantoutou in the South Huangpu area, as well as Bailianjing and Liuliqiao, the Bailianjing-Liuliqiao ferry service was suspended again starting on the 10th. It is reported that the guerrilla forces in the Punan area have been quite active in recent days. A guerrilla battle once occurred in Bailianjing on the 9th. After completing their mission, the guerrillas left, resulting in tightened security in the area, and the various ferry crossings have been blockaded again. Although the Nantoutou-Zhoujiadu ferry service is operating as usual, inspections are quite strict, and there are very few travelers.</p>
<p>Beijing-Shanghai Railway Under Control: The Wang Jinshan special forces unit, operating in the western suburbs of Shanghai, is active on the border of the extraterritorial road construction area. Wang's regular forces, as well as the Fifth Column and First Detachment concurrently commanded by Wang, crossed the Punan area, passed through Minhang, and reached the western suburbs of Shanghai. The Third Detachment, led by Bao Yunting, and the Sixth Detachment, led by Chen Yi, went directly from the western suburbs of Shanghai to the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, controlling and destroying the railway line in the Weiting area between Kunshan and Suzhou.

<h3>Old Zhabei Police Search Two Hotels: Oriental and Far Eastern Suddenly Searched; Two People Arrested, Both Drug Offenders</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reports that the Old Zhabei Police search team and patrol reserve team, accompanied by the White Russian Business Corps, conducted a large-scale search of the Oriental and Far Eastern hotels on Yu Qiaqing Road last night (the 9th). Within minutes of their arrival, the White Russian Business Corps, wearing steel helmets, surrounded both hotels, sealing off all possible escape routes. The police officers, divided into several teams, each carrying a handgun, first entered the Oriental Hotel to search. A number of reserve Indian police and plainclothes detectives wearing steel-wire vests were stationed in the lobby at the entrance. A number of Chinese men and women in the lobby were also prohibited from entering or leaving. Within minutes, two people were arrested and escorted out of the hotel. They were found to be carrying drug paraphernalia and a white powder, presumably heroin. The two men were arrested on the roof after they were seen fleeing up to the roof with the drug paraphernalia upon hearing the search team enter the building. Other search teams thoroughly searched each room, checking everything from shoes and hats to bedding. They even inspected the hot water in the bathtub of a guest who was in the middle of bathing. After half an hour, they found nothing else. At 10 p.m., the search team immediately entered the Far Eastern Hotel and carried out the same procedure. A few minutes later, they also seized some drug paraphernalia, but the drug users had already escaped, so no one was arrested. The reporter accompanied the search team to both hotels and saw the detectives' thorough search, leaving no corner or crevice unchecked. At 10:30 p.m., the inspection was completed, and the detectives left the hotel together, boarding the police cars waiting outside and returning to the police station. The White Russian Business Corps also returned in trucks. Those who had been standing by watching since the beginning of the search then swarmed to the two hotels to inquire, and the scene was filled with noise. The search was directed by Assistant Commissioner of Police Robertson and others.</p>
<h3>Opium Found Under a Seat on a Public Bus: The Owner Could Not Be Found, and the Court Ordered Confiscation</h3>
<p>The police authorities of the International Settlement have always maintained strict security in the western district. Since the Japanese authorities have repeatedly protested under the pretext of terrorist incidents, the security and searches have been particularly strict. The search teams in armed security vehicles patrol the various areas of the western suburbs almost every day, inspecting pedestrians and vehicles. At 4:30 p.m. the day before yesterday, while a large team of detectives was searching on Connaught Road and Yanping Road, a No. 10 public bus passed by. The detectives boarded the bus and searched it, finding a package of opium weighing more than 17.5 taels under one of the seats. All of the passengers on the bus at the time denied being the owner of the package, and the seat was also vacant, so the opium owner could not be found. The opium was taken back to the Gordon Road police station and sent to the First Special District Court yesterday. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the circumstances of the opium seizure. Judge Meng then ordered confiscation.</p>
<h3>Son of TASS Chief Missing: Search Continues Without Success; Family Uses Radio to Inquire</h3>
<p>Sixteen-year-old Russian boy Sterlyaikov, the son of the Shanghai branch chief of the TASS News Agency, has been missing since the morning of February 14. Some say he has gone to Chongqing to join the army, but inquiries have been made domestically using radio and other methods, without a trace. Others suspect he has boarded a ship to the United States, so the Sterlyaikov family has asked the radio stations in San Francisco and Manila to send out calls to inquire on overseas ships. The United Press International has also agreed to widely publicize his disappearance in order to find out his whereabouts.</p>
<h3>Korean Drug Trafficker and Chinese and Russian Accomplices to Be Sentenced</h3>
<p>Koreans established a morphine-selling operation at No. 8, Lane 164, Avenue du Dépôt, in the French Concession. The operation was busted by the French Concession police on January 28. The main culprit, a Korean, escaped, but his accomplices, White Russian Magorov (transliteration) and Chinese Huang Zhanglin, were arrested on the spot, and the seized morphine was taken to the police station. They were ordered to be detained for investigation. Yesterday, they were sent to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special District Court and charged with drug trafficking. Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated them in court. The defendant, Huang Zhanglin, stated that the morphine operation was established by a Korean, and he was a servant, earning a monthly salary of 14 yuan. As for the task of entertaining morphine customers, it was the responsibility of Magorov. The court then questioned Magorov about this, but Magorov repeatedly denied responsibility. The court informed them that arguments had been heard, declared the trial concluded, and scheduled sentencing for March 17. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Gathering for Mahjong, Taking the Opportunity to Steal: 100 Yuan in Legal Tender Stolen; Two Suspects Detained Pending Interrogation</h3>
<p>Chen Bosan, the owner of a small cigarette and paper shop at No. 732 Tiantong Road, was a habitual gambler. During the Lunar New Year, his gambling enthusiasm increased. He often invited friends and relatives who visited his shop to play mahjong in the bedroom upstairs. Yao Niansheng, from Zhenjiang, was also a frequent guest. On the Lantern Festival, Chen suddenly discovered that 100 yuan in new legal tender hidden on top of the cabinet in the room had disappeared. After carefully considering the relationship of those who had entered his room, Yao was the only suspect. Chen reported the information to the Huisi police station in charge, which sent detectives to investigate. Yao denied the theft, and there was no corroborating evidence, so the matter was temporarily put aside. Chen's seven-year-old daughter, Xin, only told her father the day before yesterday that she had seen Yao standing on a chair in the room after 10 a.m. on the Lantern Festival, with his hand reaching towards the top of the cabinet. Chen then took his daughter back to the police station to accuse Yao of theft. Yao was arrested a second time and admitted to the theft without hesitation. However, he said that 54 yuan of the stolen money had been lost gambling, 26 yuan had been used to repay a debt to the cigarette and paper shop at No. 102 Kaifeng Road, and the remaining money was given to Liu Kunming, a local shoemaker living at No. 21 Gaoshou Lane, Elgin Road, to help cover things up for fear of being discovered. He had borrowed 50 yuan from someone and gave it to Liu along with his remaining funds. The police chief immediately ordered the detectives in charge to arrest Liu. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special District Court for investigation. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated the case, saying that Yao had already confessed to the theft and should be punished according to the law. As for Liu's acceptance of Yao's money, saying that it was for mediation to avoid being detained, it seemed that there was a suspicion of intimidation and fraud, so Liu's part still needed to be investigated. Yao Niansheng confessed to the theft and admitted to giving Liu 70 yuan to help with the matter. Liu Kunming said that Yao entrusted him to settle the matter with the original owner and gave him 70 yuan, which he then transferred to Shen Agen, instructing him to return it to the original owner. However, Chen Bosan said that he did not know Liu at all, and no one had returned the money. Judge Dai reviewed the confessions and ordered that Yao and Liu both be returned to custody and that the hearing be rescheduled.</p>
<h3>Two British Soldiers Commit Suicide: One Died in the Home of a Russian Woman, One Died in Camp; Both Used Official Handguns to Shoot Themselves</h3>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening Post reports that two British soldiers stationed in the city died last night (the 9th). According to all appearances, they both committed suicide using official firearms. The two men were soldiers of the Royal Marines from the British warship Theseus, one being Clemont, age 20, and the other being Sergeant Hawkins of the British Royal Army Regiment, age 40. Clemont died in a lodging in the French Concession. The firearm used was a .45 caliber official handgun. Hawkins died in the barracks on Avenue Haig. The firearm used was an official rifle. Clemont landed yesterday evening and went to the home of a Russian woman he knew at No. 207, Lane 613, Avenue Joffre, around midnight. The woman had gone to a tavern. Clemont apparently entered the Russian woman's room through the balcony and window. At around 12:30 a.m., the host and hostess of the lodging were awakened by a loud noise and, along with another lodger, went upstairs to tell the person in the room not to make noise and disturb others. They then went downstairs. Five minutes later, they heard a light knock on the floor and a moan coming from upstairs. The lodging owner went back upstairs to investigate and found the door locked. With the help of the servant, he broke down the door and saw Clemont lying in a pool of blood, blood flowing from his right chest. There was a British official handgun next to him, and he was still breathing. He drank tap water. It was heard that Clemont fired the shot himself after drinking the water. The gun was not his own but belonged to the ship. The lodging owner summoned an ambulance and the police, but he died in the hospital after the ambulance arrived. Hawkins died in the barracks bedroom. This morning, other British soldiers found him lying stiff on the ground, with a gunshot wound near his right eye. An official rifle was next to him. It was discovered that he had died. Other British soldiers had last seen him at 8:30 p.m. last night. The reasons for the suicides remain a mystery. Hawkins had served in the military for 20 years.</p>
<h3>Small Clerk in Customs Brokerage Firm Embezzles Funds: Sentencing Scheduled for 17th</h3>
<p>Mao Zhenyu, a 23-year-old from Taicang, was introduced by Lu Songwu, the deputy manager of the Tongfa Customs Brokerage Firm at No. 78 Rue des Pères, in the French Concession, and entered the Tongfa Customs Brokerage Firm as a small clerk, earning only seven yuan a month. Unexpectedly, Mao had a fanciful idea of ​​falsifying the receipts issued by Taikoo and other shipping companies, adding hundreds of yuan to the amount on the receipts, and deceiving the company's accounting department into claiming the money for his own use. Over the course of a year, the amount reached a total of 3,163 yuan and 30 cents. He used 2,000 yuan to marry a wife and rent a house at No. 78 Yuli, Route des Soeurs. Recently, Xiao Zheming, the Cantonese general manager of the firm, discovered Mao's deceitful scheme and hired lawyer Qian Zheng to report it to the French police station, which detained Mao for interrogation and investigation at the Second Special Court, scheduling another hearing. All the details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Minsheng resumed the hearing in Criminal Division 1. The French Concession Administrative Authority's lawyer, Xi Zhen, filed a charge of occupational embezzlement. The plaintiff was represented by lawyer Qian, who also filed a civil suit, seeking to recover the embezzled funds. Mao Zhenyu admitted that he had worked at the Tongfa Customs Brokerage Firm for seven years, earning a monthly salary of seven yuan, and had resigned on December 18 of the previous year. He admitted to falsifying the receipts of the Taikoo Company, adding hundreds of yuan to the amounts, and deceiving the company into claiming the money, embezzling a total of about 2,000 yuan in just three months. The court reviewed the confessions and ordered the trial concluded, scheduling sentencing for the 17th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping and Selling a Nephew: Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Zou Qinshi, a 34-year-old woman from Pudong, already has a five-year-old son. She recently became pregnant and was due to give birth at the end of last year. Because there was no one to take care of her five-year-old son, Zhou Maotou, she entrusted Maotou to the care of her cousin, Zhou Zou (who lives at No. 54 Yuchang Lane, Rue du Marché, in the French Concession). Unexpectedly, on January 27 of this year, Zou Baisheng, Zou Qinshi's husband's younger brother, went to Zhou Zou's house, ostensibly to visit the child, but instead kidnapped Maotou and sold him to Zhao Xushi (age 30, of Shanghai County), at No. 16 Avenue Bugeaud, for 33 yuan. After Zou Qinshi gave birth and left the hospital a month later, she learned that her son had been kidnapped and began searching everywhere. It was only recently that she learned that her son had been kidnapped by her husband's younger brother, Zou Baisheng, and sold to Zhao Xushi as a son. She reported the matter to the French police station the day before yesterday, and Zou Baisheng and Zhao Xushi were arrested. The child was also retrieved and returned to the mother. Zou and Xu were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhang Minsheng presided over the hearing in Criminal Division 1. The French Concession Administrative Authority's lawyer filed charges of disrupting the family. Zou Baisheng confessed that he had kidnapped and sold his nephew because he was in dire financial straits. Zhao Xushi confessed that she did not know that the child had been kidnapped, so she dared to buy him and begged for leniency. The court reviewed the confessions, declared the trial concluded, and scheduled sentencing. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Draw for the First Series of Life Vouchers for Samsung Toothpaste</h3>
<p>The China Chemical Industry Society on Henan Road in this city is renowned for selling various products under the Samsung brand. Today (the 10th) was the date for the draw for the first series of life vouchers for its famous product, Samsung toothpaste. The draw was held at the Ningbo Road Cigarette and Tobacco Trade Association, and Mr. Ba Lingyun, chairman of the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign General Merchandise Trade Association, was invited to supervise the draw. Three cylinders of life voucher number beads and one cylinder of prize level beads were drawn by four gentlemen selected from the guests as representatives: Jia Junshan, Shen Guanbao, Jiang Xiangqing, and Lu Zhenjia. It is reported that the number drawn for the first prize was 052732, which was exchanged at the Yi He Socks Factory on Wuma Road.</p>
<h3>Bank Director He Gusheng Actually Converts Private Property into Gambling Dens, Which is Extremely Harmful to Society</h3>
<p>He Gusheng, a director of a certain bank, purchased a large piece of real estate at No. 864 Avenue du Roi Albert, in the western suburbs of Shanghai. In the center of the property, there is a magnificent mansion, surrounded by a large amount of open space. It is reported that He recently rented out the open space to a large gambling den for a term of three years, for a total rent of 72,000 yuan. The designs have now been completed, and the gambling houses will be built soon. From then on, in addition to the Hollywood Paradise Casino, another large-scale gambling den will be discovered on Avenue du Roi Albert. However, the most frustrating thing is that He Gusheng, who holds an important position in the financial world, is now only interested in making profits and actually leases his own land to gambling dens, which are harmful to society and full of evil, which is extremely regrettable.</p>
<h3>Many Bandits Arrested, Large Quantities of Guns and Bullets Confiscated</h3>
<p>The Xinzha Police Station and the Jing'an Temple Police Station cracked down on several bandit gang hideouts on the 9th, seizing military fire-arms and other items. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Xinzha Police Station Chinese Detective Pi Bingzhang received a tip at 5:20 AM on the 9th and went to No. 31, Lane 161, Xiamen Road, where he arrested two suspected bandits, Li Yutang and a woman named Wang Zhoushi. After interrogation, they confessed and led police to No. 572 Fujian Road, where six more accomplices were arrested: Zhang Yixian, Tong Ada, Chen Liugen, and women Zhang Shenshi, Li Zhushi, and Li Yindi. They further confessed to hiding a large number of firearms at No. 64 Guling Road. Police then arrested Tang Abao and a woman named Guo Xiuying. The following items were confiscated: three Mauser pistols, forty rounds of ammunition, one Unique pistol, nine rounds of ammunition, 36 yuan in legal tender, one Yong'an Savings Department passbook, one six-and-a-half tael silver ingot, and gold and silver ornaments. Investigations revealed that the suspects had committed numerous crimes.</p>
<p>(2) Jing'an Temple Police Station Chinese Detective Wang Jinsheng arrested a bandit named Li Jinshan at the intersection of Guangdong Road and Hubei Road at 10:15 AM on the 9th. One pistol and seven rounds of ammunition were confiscated. According to Li's confession, he was addicted to heroin. A few days prior, at a heroin consumption den, he met a man surnamed Ma. Ma invited him to rob a large quantity of heroin, so they went to Pudong to obtain a pistol. However, upon crossing the river to Puxi, he was arrested. Detectives then went to Room 309 of the Zhongnan Hotel but failed to apprehend the accomplices, only arresting two Koreans selling heroin. They were handed over to the Japanese consulate for interrogation.</p>
<p>(3) Xinzha Police Station Chinese Detective Xu Zhenting learned that a bandit named Yan Ayu from Ningbo had committed numerous thefts in the concession and Hong Kong. On the afternoon of the 9th, he went to No. 101 Lanwei Road and arrested Yan. It was found that Yan had been sentenced to one year and six months in prison for theft in 1931. Yan also confessed to committing two robberies involving "red pills" (opium pills) in Hong Kong a year prior.</p>
<p>(4) The Zhu Zhengheng Machine Shop at No. 26, Lane 1050, Chengdu Road, was robbed on December 22nd of last year. At 8:10 PM on the 9th, five more bandits broke in and robbed Zhu Jiachun and others of cash, gold ornaments, and other items before fleeing. The Zhu family immediately followed one of the bandits and reported to patrolling Chinese constables Nos. 278 and 3340, who arrested the bandit and took him back to the Xinzha Police Station. After questioning by Chinese Detective Jin Haibo, the bandit identified himself as Lu Zhisheng (also known as Lu Ming). Lu also confessed that he was invited to commit the robbery by Shi Cuilin, who is still at large.</p>
<p>All of the above cases were sent to the First Special Court Criminal Division yesterday morning. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, explained the details of the cases and requested detention for further investigation. Judge Xiao Peishen conducted a brief interrogation and then ordered detention, postponing the hearing for one week.</p>
<h3>X-ray Treatment Room at the Universal Building</h3>
<p>The fourth floor of the Universal Building on Fuzhou Road is entirely dedicated to doctors' offices. Because famous doctors of various specialties are concentrated there, it is convenient for patients. The Universal Pharmacy, in order to serve the doctors, has established an X-ray treatment room. The equipment is the latest model and extremely valuable. Doctors refer patients with difficult or X-ray treatment-requiring ailments to the room, with excellent results. As a result, the number of patients seeking treatment is increasing daily. Doctors from other locations in Shanghai can refer patients with lung disease, gastrointestinal imaging needs, orthopedic diagnoses, and stubborn skin diseases to the room for treatment. The charges are reasonable, and the service is dedicated.</p>
<h3>Students from Shanghai Medical College's Pharmacy Department Visit Zhengde Pharmaceutical Factory</h3>

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Fluctuates Uncertainly; Gold Price Plummets and Briefly Rebounds; Lowest Point Reached 2044 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market in this city was extremely volatile. Because of the sharp easing of foreign exchange, followed by a sudden return to equilibrium, the gold price rose sharply amidst the downward trend. After suffering four consecutive days of decline and hearing of a sharp easing of foreign exchange, with British gold reaching eight and a half pence, gold dealers first sold aggressively. Securities brokers and northern brokers also began selling after making slight advances. For a time, buyers were at a loss, causing prices to plummet by more than 40 yuan, successively breaking through the four major levels of 2090 to 2050 yuan, falling to a low of 2044 yuan. Compared with the unprecedented high of 2200 yuan last Saturday, it fell by more than 156 yuan. Upon hearing that foreign exchange was tightening again, the northern brokers temporarily stopped selling. Therefore, with the double buying pressure from money changers and gold shops, it rebounded to outside the 2060 yuan level. In the early afternoon, the northern brokers resumed selling, causing it to fall to 2050 yuan. However, foreign exchange remained tight, and money changers increased their purchases, eventually leading to a surge to 2075 yuan. However, this was still a sharp drop of 23 yuan compared to the previous day's closing, although the fluctuations were quite large and there were no major waves. Everyone was uneasy, and trading was very active, with 1,220 taels changing hands. Gold jewelry also fluctuated unusually, rising and falling, changing five times throughout the day, and eventually falling by 3 yuan. Customs gold remained stable, but British pure gold and other items rose slightly.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Plunges Heavily, Down Another 23 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially heard that foreign exchange was easing, so most buyers waited and watched. The selling price was reduced from 2100 yuan to 90 yuan before any trading occurred. Initially, a spot gold dealer sold 50 taels each to gold dealers and securities brokers at 2090 yuan, which was the opening price, 8 yuan lower than the previous close. After the opening, because there was a greater lack of buyers, the downward trend was quite severe. The spot gold dealer sold another 50 taels to money changers at 80 yuan, and a gold shop sold 50 taels to money changers at 68 yuan. At that time, securities brokers continued to purchase, so it rose slightly. The securities brokers vigorously purchased 100 taels at 68 yuan and 75 yuan (all sold by a certain Hong of a gold shop). Before long, the securities brokers suddenly stopped buying and sold aggressively, selling 50 taels to money changers at 75 yuan. During this time, it was heard that the easing of foreign exchange was intensifying, buyers cautiously waited and watched, and the securities brokers did not hesitate to sell cheaply, so the downward trend intensified again. The securities brokers sold 50 taels to money changers at 65 yuan, and another 50 taels to money changers, falling to 45 yuan. Subsequently, a certain gold shop also sold 50 taels to money changers at 44 yuan, which was the lowest price. Afterwards, it was heard that the easing of foreign exchange had stopped and turned tight, so it triggered buying. The money changers and local brokers purchased 100 taels from their peers at 50 yuan (the sellers were the ones who had previously purchased and profited from the liquidation). Later, a certain gold shop sold 50 taels to gold dealers at 47 yuan, a gold shop purchased 20 taels from money changers at 90 yuan, money changers purchased 50 taels from gold shops at 55 yuan, and gold shops traded 50 taels among themselves, with the price jumping to 65 yuan, and then another 50 taels traded between them at 63 yuan. It was already noon. In the afternoon, money changers first traded 50 taels among themselves at 60 yuan. Later, the securities brokers came to sell again, continuing the decline. The securities brokers sold 50 taels to gold shops at 50 yuan. At that time, foreign exchange was softening again, and a certain money changer suddenly developed a buying interest, causing it to repeat the rise, purchasing 50 taels from securities brokers at 54 yuan. Afterwards, the securities brokers stopped selling, so the upward trend intensified again, raising it directly to outside the 70 yuan level. Gold dealers purchased 50 taels from money changers at 74 yuan, and a certain money changer purchased 200 taels at 75 yuan (supplied by securities brokers, gold shops, and their peers). Afterwards, another money changer slightly sold off, but buyers remained on the sidelines, so although the price was shouted down to 72 yuan, it was still difficult to find a counterpart, so the closing price was still set at 2075 yuan. As a result, it fell by 23 yuan compared to the previous day's closing (already falling for five days, totaling 115 yuan). The selling price of the spot gold dealer's own brand of gold was 2085 yuan, and the buying price was 2070 yuan. The current margin gold is hanging at 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is no trading.</p>
<p>Gold Jewelry Changes Five Times, Ultimately Falling a Small 3 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of gold jewelry per tael was not changed. Then, at 9:52 AM, because the spot gold had opened weakly, it was also lowered by a small 1 yuan. At 10:05 AM, spot gold continued to soften, so it was lowered by another small 2 yuan. Later, at 10:55 AM, the potential of spot gold became more weak, so it was lowered by another small 2 yuan. At noon at 12:00 PM, because the spot gold had slightly rebounded, it was also raised by 1 yuan. At 3:55 PM in the afternoon, because the spot gold continued to rebound, it also followed with another 1 yuan. As a result, it fell by 3 yuan compared to the previous day's close. Datongxing and Laoqingyun suspended at 210 yuan, and Xintongxing was 208 yuan, purchasing at 202 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Briefly Tightens in the Afternoon; British Gold Reaches Eight and a Half Pence</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was filled with the selling by the pseudo-"North China Reserve Bank," the Chinese cotton yarn dealers, and speculators, so the potential was quite loose. It is estimated that British gold reached as high as eight and a half pence, and the US exchange rate also rose to 16.5625 yuan. Later, because the "North China Reserve Bank" resumed purchasing, combined with the Hong Kong Telegraph Company's continued buying, the potential turned soft. However, the result was still slightly loose, with significant fluctuations and brisk trading. The Hong Kong exchange rate followed the fluctuations of the British and American exchange rates, initially easing to 56.875 yuan, then slightly tightening, with the result continuing to ease.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London large bills were short 0.0625 in the near term and long 0.0625 in the far term. The New York spot price was unchanged. The London raw gold rose by half a penny. The British exchange rate against the US exchange rate was up 6 mao, unchanged against the French, and up 0.125 against Hong Kong. The US exchange rate was flat against the British, up 0.0625 against the French, and up 0.25 yuan against Shanghai. The central listing for each exchange rate remained unchanged. The bank's opening selling price in the morning was 8.34375 pence for the British exchange rate and 16.3125 yuan for the US exchange rate, with no changes compared to the previous close. After the opening, the pseudo-"North China Reserve Bank" first sold aggressively, and Chinese speculators also followed suit, so the potential stepped loose. The North China pseudo-bank and Chinese speculators successively sold British exchange rates to HSBC, Anda, Youli, and a certain bank, from 8.390625 pence to 8.4375 pence, and the US exchange rate also rose from 16.40625 yuan to half a yuan. The HSBC listing was unchanged. The silver balance tax fell 0.025 yuan, calculated at 7.75 percent. Subsequently, Chinese cotton yarn dealers also came to sell, so the easing trend continued. The cotton yarn dealers sold British exchange rates to HSBC at 8.5 pence and sold US exchange rates to a certain bank at 16.5625 yuan. At that time, the "North China Reserve Bank" suddenly resumed purchasing, causing the easing trend to immediately tighten. The North China pseudo-bank purchased British exchange rates from foreign banks at 8.4375 pence. Near noon, various money changers frequently sold Hong Kong exchange rates, and foreign banks were not enthusiastic, so the situation was quite tight. The money changers sold Hong Kong exchange rates to Anda, Holland, and Huayi from 56.75 yuan to 56.875 yuan. The noon closing bank selling price was 8.390625 pence for the British exchange rate and 16.40625 yuan for the US exchange rate.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, a sudden surge in buying from Hong Kong via foreign telegraph, and the supply from foreign banks was not smooth, so the situation turned tight and soft. Hong Kong Telegraph purchased British exchange rates from HSBC and foreign banks at 8.34375 pence. Subsequently, a father purchased US exchange rates from a certain bank at 16.3125 yuan. After that, the market became quiet, with only slight Hong Kong exchange transactions. The various money changers forcefully sold Hong Kong exchange rates to foreign banks Huabi at 56.25 yuan, and the situation also turned soft. By the evening closing, the bank's selling price was 8.359375 pence for the British exchange rate and 16.34375 yuan for the US exchange rate. As a result, compared to the previous close, the British exchange rate eased by 0.015625 yuan, the US exchange rate tightened by 0.03125 yuan, and the Hong Kong exchange rate also declined by half a yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the London pure gold rose by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate was unchanged. The foreign exchange market in this city took advantage of the overnight downward trend, and Western merchants Sassoon and others frequently sold. Tianjin Telegraph liquidated many positions. The supply from Hong Kong Telegraph was continuous. Market prices eased all the way, with no room for review. In the afternoon, Western merchants stopped selling, the supply from foreign telegraph became scarce, and foreign firms were suddenly busy closing accounts. Banks' willingness to sell faded, and market prices tightened. Sassoon, the cotton yarn dealers, and others came to replenish their positions, and sellers were scarce. The result was a very slight easing. The initial follow-up to the easing of exchange rates by spot gold led to a frantic sell-off by all parties, and the market price was extremely weak. However, gold dealers, money changers, and others still held bullish psychology, occasionally absorbing. Later, upon hearing that exchange rates were tightening, retail investors added to their positions even more fiercely, and Tianjin brokers stepped in to purchase, with a strong rebound. The result was still a decline. Foreign currencies were affected by the easing of exchange rates and the decline in spot gold. Wealthy individuals were still selling in large numbers. Money changers' absorption was not smooth, and market prices continued to decline. However, the downward trend turned moderate, and most currencies were stable and unchanged. The Australian gold note has rebounded, and the decline is observed to have stopped. Overall trading was not smooth. The association's transactions were extremely rare, with only Huitong selling to Changtai, purchasing British gold notes for 75 pounds. Yesterday's market prices: British pound down 4 jiao, British gold note down 0.05 yuan, US gold pound down 3 jiao, Hong Kong note down 0.01 yuan, French franc note down 0.5 yuan, Singapore note down 0.02 yuan, Canadian note down 0.04 yuan, Italian note down 0.01 yuan, and Australian gold note was the only one to rise by 0.1 yuan. The others were all unchanged.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Up Half a Penny; Customs Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>According to an 8th London telegram, British pure gold rose by half a penny per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 3 pence. As a result, the China cash purchase price of the Central Bank also rose to 1210.03 yuan. The listed customs gold was unchanged, remaining at 2.392 yuan. The Shanghai standard margin gold price also rose by 4 jiao, calculated at 1205.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Exchange Fund Loan</h3>
<p>— Sheng Mujie</p>
<p>(1) From Goods Loans to Monetary Loans In mid-December 1938, the US Export-Import Bank granted China a credit line of US$25 million. At that time, the author commented on the economic significance of this loan, explaining that it was a goods loan and inferring that British loans to China would definitely materialize. As expected, after the amendment of the Export Credits Guarantee Act on December 15 last year, a loan of 500,000 pounds was granted to China, and it was also stipulated that several batches of commercial credit loans would be granted to China at the end of last year to purchase goods other than trains and munitions to develop the economic construction of the southwestern provinces. At that time, the British side argued that China's needs were very large, and if this meager sum of 500,000 pounds were distributed equally according to the Chinese population, each person could only get one Farthing—equal to one-quarter of a penny, which would not be of any benefit in reality; moreover, the British government not only failed to allow China to borrow softly, but also designated this meager sum for the purpose of purchasing heavy-duty vehicles and transportation materials, which was really not perfect. Although China received this 500,000 pounds when it established a US$25 million credit loan with the United States, it did not feel it was insufficient, and only hoped that Britain could provide stronger assistance in finance and monetary affairs. Therefore, only three months have passed from last year to now, and China and Britain have established a monetary loan of 5 million pounds.</p>
<p>(2) Establishment of Sino-British Monetary Loan</p>
<p>According to the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Simon, who declared in the House of Commons on March 8, the establishment of this Sino-British monetary loan is a loan to China's foreign exchange stabilization fund, which is used to consolidate China's legal tender system. We can analyze the content, nature, and use of this loan decision based on Simon's reply to Councilor Lawrence's request to publish words to assist China in maintaining the stability of the true value of legal tender as follows:</p>
<p>Name: China Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Loan;</p>
<p>Amount: British commitment of 5 million pounds;</p>
<p>Purpose: To consolidate legal tender;</p>
<p>Lending Banks: HSBC and Chartered Bank;</p>
<p>Guarantee: If the fund suffers losses at the end, the British Treasury guarantees compensation; if it obtains profits, it will be transferred to the British Treasury:</p>
<p>Term: The term of use is limited to twelve months, which can be extended upon expiry, and can be terminated early if necessary.</p>
<p>Britain's plan to loan to China was considered by the cabinet in July last year. At that time, it was not approved due to insufficient reasons, and it was feared that it would be inconvenient to adopt an active plan in the Far East when the European crisis was progressing. However, the Japanese cut off commerce in North China, prohibited navigation on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers under the pretext of military affairs, organized a Japanese yen group, excluded foreigners' interests in China, and even provoked Britain by bombing Kowloon and occupying Hainan Island, threatening Hong Kong, forcing Britain to take necessary measures to protect its interests in China. Therefore, in fact, Britain on the one hand granted China credit to purchase British goods, and on the other hand loaned funds to China to help it maintain the legal tender system. Now that the Spanish issue is about to end, Britain can concentrate its attention on the Far East issue and confront Japan economically. Then, this monetary loan is undoubtedly a diplomatic gesture, no less than a warning to Japan that although Britain does not want to use war to maintain the open door in China, it will never allow its interests in China to be eliminated due to the lack of practical assistance. Under this reason, the recent Sino-British monetary loan of 5 million pounds was established.</p>
<p>(3) New China's Wartime Financial Policy</p>
<p>Based on the previous analysis of this Sino-British loan, it can be known that this is the latest type of financial policy in China's wartime financial policy. According to the news revealed by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir John Simon, the Chinese government has notified the British government that it intends to continue the current monetary policy, and in addition to the legal tender reserve, it will also set up a foreign exchange stabilization fund of 10 million pounds to stabilize the legal tender as part of this policy. It is obvious that this foreign exchange stabilization fund policy is a new type of financial policy in China. According to China's implementation of the silver export equalization tax system in October 1934, in order to stabilize foreign exchange, the three government banks of the Central Bank of China Transportation raised a fund of 100 million yuan and handed it over to the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee for use. However, strengthening the use of this policy now is of course a new financial policy during wartime.</p>
<p>China's current monetary policy, from the point of view of maintaining the legal tender exchange rate, is nothing more than the control of foreign exchange, the collection of gold and silver, and the exploitation of gold sand. However, at present, taking the collection of gold and silver and the mining of gold sand as the only way to solve the foreign exchange problem is really too slow to solve the urgent need. Now that China naturally has a strong power to maintain the legal exchange rate of legal tender, in fact, the legal exchange rate of legal tender has always been stable after nearly 20 months of war, but the current foreign exchange control method is not said to be completely appropriate and without drawbacks (refer to Kong Xiangxi's speech at the 14th annual meeting of the China Economic Society in Chongqing). Therefore, it is now conceived from the foreign exchange stabilization fund in order to make the legal tender system more and more consolidated. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the British government sent economic adviser Sir Otto Niemeyer to vigorously assist China in stabilizing its currency and establishing the legal tender system. Could it be that after the Sino-Japanese War, it would be indifferent to the stabilization of legal tender, which is most important to British finance and economy? Now that China is making its best efforts to continue its current monetary policy and implement a new financial policy to establish a foreign exchange stabilization fund in order to stabilize the legal tender, it has a great relationship with Britain's trade in China, and Britain is happy to lend money to help the success of this new policy.

<h3>Securities Domestic and Foreign Bonds Continue to Rise Sharply Railway Stocks Already Showing Discrepancies</h3>
<p>The securities black market continued to soar yesterday. Types C and E have both broken through the 50 yuan mark. As predicted by this newspaper, this kind of rising trend has changed from slow to rapid and lasted for more than half a month. The market price has risen by about six yuan in total. The main reason is this major loan decision. However, the rapid rise of public bonds is bound to cause a reversal, because the buying power of many parties is gradually feeling satisfied. Yesterday, only No. 20 was strongly absorbing, and the rest were only sporadic purchases. The bulls are looking for an opportunity to sell, and this must also be guarded against.</p>
<p>Yesterday's process: At the beginning of the morning, type C immediately broke through the 50 yuan mark. Gan Hao vigorously absorbed a very large number. Yongkang and No. 5 followed. Although there were sales from Qiaofeng Tianxing and Runli, the price was very firm, so the market price rose straight up. Retail investors entered and exited frequently, and the market was even more lively. The market rose by six to eight cents in one session. Because type B held a lottery, the market price excluded the right to win the lottery, but it still rose by one and a half cents. In the afternoon, No. 20 continued to pull up, and Nos. 15 and 52 both had replenishment. Maoda Hao also had considerable buying power. Type E broke through the 50 yuan mark again. Type C saw 51 yuan and 4 cents. The highest price of type A also broke through 8 yuan. The sellers were Tongkang and Zhenkang selling. Lianhe and Hengfu also sold off. Nos. 11 and 35 all sold off, but the market price was still pulled up very firmly. The strength of the rising trend was only seen this year. In total, the market price rose sharply by 1 yuan and 1 cent to 1 yuan and 4 cents. Type B only rose by 7 and a half cents due to the lottery. The total number of transactions was more than 1.67 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>The stock exchange or yarn cloth exchange stock of 50 shares was priced at 37 yuan and 5 cents.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Currency Bonds On the 9th of this month (Thursday), the market price of various bonds continued to rise and the rising trend has not stopped. There was still an increase of half a pound to one and a half pounds. However, railway bonds showed discrepancies and the steps were not consistent. There was also a fluctuation of one pound. Vickers Aircraft Bonds rose sharply by one and a half pounds, priced at 16 pounds. The Sino-French US 5% public bonds with stamped bonds and the Qing Dynasty British-issued bonds continued to rise by one pound. The former was priced at 69 pounds, and the latter was priced at 52 pounds. Crisp Bonds continued to rise by half a pound, priced at 37 and a half pounds. Railway bonds: Daoging Railway Bonds rose by one pound, priced at 23 pounds. Longhai and Guangjiu Railway Bonds also rose angrily by one pound. The former was priced at 16 pounds, and the latter was priced at 21 pounds. However, the Jinghu and Jinpu Railway Bonds fell back by one pound. The former fell to 24 pounds, and the latter both returned to the original price of 16 pounds. London physical supply: There were 2,000 pounds of Qing Dynasty British-issued bonds, priced at 53 pounds, one pound higher than the market. There were 2,000 pounds of Sino-French US 5% public bonds with stamped bonds (i.e., US$10,000), priced at 69 and a half pounds, half a pound higher than the market. Vickers Aircraft Bonds were 500 pounds, priced at 16 pounds, all at the same price as the market. Jinghu Railway Bonds were 2,000 pounds, priced at 24 pounds, all at the same price as the market. Huguang Railway Bonds were 5,000 pounds of non-German issued bonds, priced at 24 pounds, one pound higher than the market.</p>
<p>London British East Asian Companies Stocks On the 9th of this month (Thursday), the market price also tracked Chinese foreign debt and sparked a rising trend. Chartered Bank shares rose by half a pound, priced at 9 and a half pounds. HSBC shares rose sharply by 4 pounds, with market prices of 91 pounds each. Kaiping Coal Mine unregistered shares continued to rise by one shilling, priced at 19 shillings.

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Limited Freight Between China and India Indian Cotton Unable to be Shipped to Shanghai on Time US Cotton Industry Proposal Passed</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: New York's Smith proposal, which had been long awaited in Washington (as reported in this newspaper on February 16), was approved by the Senate Agriculture Committee, causing short sellers to violently cover their positions, and industry players also had huge transactions. As a result, the cotton market rose sharply by 13 to 4 pound notes. India, including forecasts, rose by one and a half rupees. Egypt fell by more than 20 pound notes. It was still loose yesterday. Converted into legal tender, US cotton rose slightly by six cents, Indian cotton rose by four cents, and Egypt fell by more than three cents.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Indian cotton was sold too much, and the shipments to the Far East were very crowded. The freight between China and India that can be assigned to cotton transporters is limited. As a result, Indian cotton is fully stocked in the Indian wharf warehouses, and the Shanghai factories have purchased cotton due to needs, and it has already been used as a credit. Due to the fact that Indian cotton cannot be shipped on time, all are deeply worried, fearing that the raw cotton will be interrupted. Temporary observation of the handling of Indian cotton, so the foreign cotton transaction turned quiet. Yesterday, Xinyu imported 1,000 bales of US cotton, priced at 75 yuan and 5 cents. No other factory has any transactions. The cotton prices yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>Native cotton business is still quiet, because the goods are too scarce, the price is difficult to loosen, and the foreign exchange conversion price is cheap, and the exchange draft is prolonged endlessly. The factory of course chooses the cheap over the expensive, so the foreign cotton business is unusually lively, and the native cotton transactions are very few. 180 bales of Xiasahua arrived at the dock, and 1,080 bales of Yaohua also arrived. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Hoarders Buy and Sell to Each Other It is Not Easy to Sell 20-Count Double Horse Japanese Yarn Fell Sharply and There is Even More Lack of Acceptance</h3>
<p>The yarn market turned weak. The reason is that our army in Hubei Province strongly resisted, and the Japanese planes bombed even more fiercely. People's minds were slightly delayed in purchasing, and transactions were therefore lacking. At the same time, the general hoarding of goods was very thick, so the daily market transactions were all mutual buying and selling. Actual transactions basically did not move, and the market did not get rid of the wandering path. However, because 32-count and 42-count yarns were produced less, and merchants hoarded goods and were willing to sell, the market outlook was still stable.</p>
<p>The current yarn business was not moving at the beginning of the morning. Although people's minds were bullish, they held the good goods in their hands and waited for the price to rise and sell them. Therefore, the opening price of 20-count Bianma yarn was 399 yuan, down 1 yuan and 5 cents. There were no major ups and downs after that. It rose slightly in the middle, but soon returned. The lowest price was 398 yuan, and the dock receipt was 396 yuan. Due to the rain in the afternoon, the transaction was even more weak. 20-count Shuangma 398 yuan was not easy to sell. The dock receipt price was 395 yuan. As a result, the entire day's transaction was only 805 bales. The market price of 20-count Bianma Tiannu was the same as the remaining 10-count coarse yarn and 32-count 42 moves. Today, 255 pieces of yarn were shipped to Tianjin, and 42 pieces were shipped to Yantai. Yesterday, 2,500 pieces of yarn came from Tianjin. The amount bought by each bank is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>In the Japanese yarn market, the falling trend suddenly started. It is said that the war in the Subei area is fierce, the sales channel is blocked, people's minds are panic, and the market price has fallen sharply. However, large households are still in a bullish position. The current yarn price of 20-count Shuiyue is 334 yuan to 32 yuan. The current yarn price of 20-count Lanfeng is 328 yuan, suddenly falling to 324 yuan, and there are very few acceptors.</p>
<p>Piece Goods Summer Goods Should Sell Well Eastern Piece Goods Are Weak Due to Rumors of Tianjin Exchange Suspension Woolen Fabrics Show a Rush</p>
<p>Domestic cloth bleached mercerized light-colored piece goods: Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Shantou banks continue to purchase vigorously. However, dark-colored cotton cloths are restricted by the season. Remote customers and local streets only have a little embellishment. The prices offered by various factories are also relatively cheap. Wen Yonggang handled more than 200 bales of coarse cloth from factories such as Yih Da and Dasheng, and nearly 100 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill from various brands such as Cannon Cart, Dapeng, and Three Rabbits. Guangdong banks handled 50 or 60 bales of fine twill and fine cloth. Fine yarn fabrics are most in demand on local streets. Yefu silk, which is about one yuan per yard for upper body goods, foreign yarn above 16 or 7 yuan, and bleached cloth are vigorously searched for. The prices of printed hemp yarn from Lun Chang Factory are all above 14 yuan. The prices of non-fading flower cloths of various grades are all above 11 yuan. Summer sales have been good in this city for many years, so the local street wholesale shops have advanced hundreds of boxes of inventory from the factories early, because the new goods will definitely be expensive when they are launched. High-end foreign yarn is more popular. Even local streets, Sichuan, Shantou, and Yong banks have added to their purchases. However, the demand for mid-to-low-end goods is more sluggish. The Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Shantou banks and local street wholesale shops have smooth transactions for low-end Qingshui bleached cloth, totaling more than 200 boxes yesterday, priced at about 11 or 12 yuan and 5 cents.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods White Goods Fine Cloth Fine Twill Was Soft Yesterday Because There Were Rumors of Tianjin Exchange Suspension Hand Goods Were Resold Market Dumpers Seized the Opportunity The More Sellers of 12-Pound Dragon Head Fine Cloth Were The Most Falling One Time Dumped to 11 Yuan and 8 Cents But Soon Rose Back 8 and a Half Cents Which Was Another 1 Cent Lower Than the Previous Day's Sales Plate While Other Rainbow Ball and Flying Fish Only Had a Fluctuation of 5 Cents In the Aftermarket Local Street Industry Took Advantage of Cheap Purchases and Transacted More Than 700 Pieces of Fine Cloth and Fine Twill of Various Brands Therefore When the Market Closed People's Spirits Turned Firm Again</p>

<h3>Silk and Tea Japanese Silk Enters the 1,000 Yuan Mark Silk Prices Expected to Fall</h3>
<p>In the foreign silk market, since the Japanese authorities ordered the crackdown on speculation last Sunday, the silk prices in the eastern market have been trending downstream. Yokohama spot fell to 1,000 yuan yesterday, opening at 995 yuan, and opening at 985 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of 20 yuan. The forward opened at 967 yuan and closed at 928 yuan in the afternoon, a decrease of 39 yuan compared to the previous day. Therefore, the trend of the silk market has fundamentally changed. It is predicted that ports such as New York will follow suit and shrink. Yesterday, spot silk in New York, Shanghai silk, each fell by one to three points. Lyon Shanghai silk fell by half a franc.</p>
<p>The local silk market was quite quiet yesterday. Export sales fell by one because Yokohama reported a fall, and the success of the Sino-British loan lengthened the exchange rate, which made the distance between domestic and foreign market prices farther. The price of White Factory B was 1,800 yuan, which has fallen by 150 yuan compared to the peak. However, the foreign firm's eating price still needs to be reduced by more than 50 yuan. The domestic market's sentiment turned weak, and all turned from waiting and watching to expecting a fall, so the intention to enter was very weak, and transactions were few. Yesterday, only six loads were opened.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes Speculation Controls Raw Oil Actual Delivery Hesitant Soybean Oil is Also Just a Game of Football</h3>
<p>Recently, the oil market situation has completely changed into exchange trading, resulting in hesitation in actual sales. The entire transaction is controlled by speculators. Yesterday, the market situation of raw soybean oil generally rose after being flat in the front. Due to the soaring price of blue peanut oil by 4 yuan the day before yesterday, the foreign yards in the market were frequently short, resulting in small buyers taking cautious steps. Moreover, because the Qingdao control procedures have not yet been clearly announced, the potential trend is hovering. It is estimated that 120 pieces of Jiaozhou oil and 600 cans of Yantai canned oil were opened. The market sentiment of soybean oil was also resting on the Japanese side. There was only a game of football on the market. It is estimated that 70 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were delivered at the end of March, priced at 30 yuan, 4 cents and a half, 200 barrels in the lower part of March, priced at 30 yuan, 4 cents and a half, and 3 cents, and 400 barrels in April, priced at 30 yuan, 2 cents to 5 and a half cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 480 pieces of imported goods arrived, soybean oil came from Yantai, and 150 pieces of Peiyou came from Ningbo. Today, 1,200 barrels of machine oil are exported to Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Grain Japonica and Indica Rice Have Both Reached the Price Limit Bian Yuan Opened at 19 Yuan and 4 Cents Foreign Wheat Continues to Arrive and Local Wheat is Stagnant</h3>
<p>Dumi River has arrived at No. 5, and more than 2,000 bags of steamed buns have been transported by car. Since the price limit, high-priced goods have disappeared from the market. Both buyers and sellers only exchange medium-priced goods, and the opening prices are all at the price limit line of 14 yuan, except for the He Xia goods. The highest price of Bian Yuan has opened at 19 yuan and 4 cents, which is more than 5 or 6 cents higher than the previous market.</p>
<p>There were 6,000 to 7,000 bags of Hakka Indica rice transactions. The market price increased by 3 or 4 cents. However, the market strictly limited the price and decided that the highest price limit for Hakka Indica rice was 13 yuan and a half. It was only adjusted by returning bags and handling the goods in the middle. In terms of the quality of the goods, the highest Hakka Indica rice should reach 14 yuan. Check the rice grain import and export. Today, 3,400 bags of rice were transferred from the port to Tianjin.</p>
<p>Because the price of rice rose and the current flour was insufficient, the local street wholesale price of flour still needed 4 yuan and 7 cents and 5 cents. The customer plate was slightly different, so the flour price continued to have three market prices. The Tong Market was jointly organized by the North and South banks. The No. 2 flour car boat, Tianzhu, Fisherman, and other brands totaled more than 50,000 bags, priced at 4 yuan, 7 cents, and 4 yuan, 6 cents and a half. The combined price of high-brand foreign flour continued to be equal to that of local flour. Futures were cheaper than local flour. Check that 8,000 bags of flour were shipped to Yantai today, and 1,000 bags came from Hong Kong and were transferred to Tianjin. However, the sales of local wheat were still sluggish.</p>
<p>Foreign wheat arrived one after another. The German ship Gantzee Fritzen, which transported wheat from Australia to Shanghai last time, lacked coal and went to Yokohama to load coal. Later, the machinery suddenly suffered damage, which caused the delay to Shanghai. Yesterday, according to the agent of the ship, the ship has now been repaired and left Yokohama yesterday. It is expected to arrive at the port on the 15th. Now there is another Rothley, which is loaded with 8,818 tons of wheat from Australia and is already on its way. It is scheduled to be moored at various docks and floating pontoons on the Xingqi River. There is no space, so it is first anchored outside the port. When the dock or pontoon is empty, it will enter the port and unload. (Zu)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Dutch Coarse White Thrown Price Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market gradually stabilized. The guild allocated 24 Dutch coarse white discs. The transfer cargo called 16 yuan and 7 cents. The spot goods were not moving. Taikoo Sugar B Mark traded dozens of bags at 24 yuan, 3 cents, 7 points and a half. Because the production price of Dutch coarse white continued to rise by 2 cents, it recently threw over 9 yuan and 5 cents. Yesterday, it was called 5 yuan, 1 cent and a half. The Chao Bank of Chinese Sugar opened more than 100 bags of Mianbai, Shangbingbai was 24 yuan and 2 cents to 24 yuan. It was decided to be 23 yuan and 7 cents. Chaoqing Shangtizhuang was 15 yuan, 4 and 5 cents, and Shanghuanggang was 15 yuan and 2 cents, totaling more than 200 bags. Longgang Qing was 136 bags, 13 yuan and 5 cents. Shan Chi was more than 400 bags, 15 yuan and a half, and the second one was 15 yuan, 3 cents to 15 yuan. The Min Bank opened 120 bags of Dagongfen, 23 yuan, and more than 40 bags of miscellaneous sub-whites, 19 yuan. Because the arrival of Diaoging increased slightly, although the bid was scored, there was no chance to trade.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials New Citrus Fruit Sales Turn Active</h3>
<p>New citrus fruit is also named Paoken, (ie raw material for small green peel). In the winter, sales were mediocre, and the middle Zhuang only sold 8 yuan per load. Until recently, the removal turned active. The day before yesterday, a certain number sold 60 to 70 pieces of the same one, and the price was 11 yuan, which was completely sold. Now there is another batch, which has been called 14 yuan. It is found that the accumulation in the producing area is gradually thinning, and there is a rising trend.</p>

<h3>Maintaining Discipline</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>I really don't know how many heartless and sick people, acting like ghosts, are taking advantage of the chaos of war to do things that are harmful to nature and reason! Not long ago, we saw the case of the Hu bandits, father and son, killing their mother and forcibly marrying their daughter. Recently, we saw the case of the director of a refugee camp beating a refugee to death. These two cases are currently being tried. We cannot prejudge or interfere with the future judgments. There will be fair laws in place. But we cannot but express our loyalty to uphold the law and maintain discipline. We hope that the main culprits in these two cases will receive their due punishment; and during this national crisis, their actions are even more unforgivable. Therefore, we especially hope that our judges will "increase the punishment."</p>
<p>However, these are all obvious criminal cases. The law is easy to impose sentences, and society is easy to distinguish clearly and know that the crimes deserve their due punishment. Only one word is subtle, and the law has no explicit provisions, so it cannot be said that he is guilty. A line of detail is that society regards it as a bad habit and often tolerates it. Such people have gained extra-legal freedom and a paradise in corruption. This is very harmful to the world's morality, people's hearts, the country, and the nation. We should not let them go lightly.</p>
<p>A certain lawyer actually called stolen goods "spoils of war." What is this! Perhaps his words do not violate the law, but he admits that the things looted by the enemy are "spoils of war" and argues that those who buy these "spoils of war" from the enemy "do not constitute the crime of receiving stolen goods." May I ask which country's people do he and the parties he represents consider themselves to be! If everyone recognizes and argues like that lawyer and deals with our enemies, what resistance war do we need? Isn't it just to cooperate with them! Therefore, we must also shout out the slogan of "Maintaining Discipline" and denounce it!</p>
<p>The notice issued by the President of the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the President of the Shanghai Second Special District Court, "prohibiting clerks from soliciting money from litigants," is doing what should be done on the positive side of "Maintaining Discipline," then we should sing the praises of our wise officials.</p>
<p>"People must insult themselves before others insult them." During this period when the whole country is united and strengthening the power of resistance, we must of course uphold our national laws, and we must especially maintain the social discipline that the law cannot reach!</p>
<h3>Spanish Refugee School</h3>
<p>— Yun Translation</p>
<p>In a monastery with a garden, there is a refugee school. Inside, seventy children, struggling with hunger, are studying. These children have all escaped from bombed areas. There is a female teacher teaching them. They don't have a single piece of paper, a needle, or a piece of chalk.</p>
<p>A soldier past his draft age serves in the school, and two wounded young men also volunteer to teach under the teacher's direction. They are all like older brothers to the children. Some children, like many soldiers, have become disabled.</p>
<p>The teacher does not have the power of punishment or reward; this is handled by a student council organized by the children themselves.</p>
<p>Every Sunday afternoon, the hospital sends a driver in a car to take them there for baths and haircuts. This is a day of exceptional joy for them, and they often sing triumphant anti-fascist songs.</p>
<p>On Monday afternoons, a doctor and a nurse come to their school to give them a thorough physical examination. Large tables are set up in the room, and medical record cards are prepared for each child. A representative sorts the cards and lines up the children in the hallway. Another helps the children undress. The doctor calls out things like, "Teeth need treatment," "Elbow joint pain," etc., while the nurse records them on the cards. Another health representative listens nearby and records the doctor's words to report to the children's parents, so that the parents can properly care for the children.</p>
<p>When they get some paper, they write short articles and post them on the walls of the hallway as a bulletin board. The compositions are all spontaneous. The writing is done in red ink because they have nothing else to use. As soon as they entered the monastery, they started raising rabbits, raising chicks, and gardening. The teacher also makes diagrams to teach the girls how to sew clothes and the boys how to do carpentry. Although they still lack many things, such as needles, spinning wheels, and hammers, children elsewhere will help them and send them pencils, paper, colored chalk, tools, cloth, balls, and everything else that children love.</p>
<p>The students' lunch is provided by the school. Each child receives a cup of cocoa and a piece of bread per meal. The expenses are donated by the hospital staff and wounded soldiers. (Translated from "New Masses")</p>
<h3>The Emergence of New Realist Literature</h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>In literature, works of new realism emerged after works of new idealism. The advantage of the original realist school lies in its ability to write nakedly, realistically, vividly, and thoroughly, in accordance with reason and logic, which is why it is deeply moving and powerful. Because the romantic school before the realist school, starting from ideals, fell into fantasy, and passion flowed into delusion, becoming broad, superficial, and weak, it was overwhelmed by the realist school. —The romantic school's attitude was close to playfulness, and it could not satisfy the desires of serious readers, which is why the solemn and rigorous realist school arose. From this, it can be seen that realism is better than relying on ideals in deeply exploring problems and carefully studying the use of life. However, the realist school focuses on the reproduction of facts, which inevitably leads to restraint; when society is extremely chaotic, there are too many ugly things, and revolutionary means are needed to rapidly improve the situation, it is not enough to rely on the realist school to expose the inherent bad phenomena in a satirical way as an attack on the dark side, treating a headache when it hurts, and treating a foot pain when it hurts, to save the entire society with serious illnesses. Moreover, later naturalists neglected the bright side and always focused on the description of the dark side, and too many sad hints inevitably made people feel depressed. Readers in a dim environment are already depressed enough, and it is even more depressing to see dim works, feeling hopeless and disappointed.</p>
<p>The remedy is to focus on the description of the bright side, to make people optimistic, to actively represent exemplary figures who are active and capable, and to encourage them, so that after readers understand what they should do, they will naturally and unconsciously put it into practice, thereby fundamentally transforming the bad environment. Such active and capable exemplary figures do not have ready-made models available in the existing facts, so the author has to fabricate them, which is the characteristic of new idealism. For example, in the past, there were no figures who could effectively resist the aggression and ruthless oppression of the Japanese invaders that could be used as ready-made models; but resistance must be prepared, and resistance must be advocated in literature, so the so-called nationalist literature at that time was a propaganda tool to prepare for resistance, and in addition to using stories of ancient national heroes to inspire, it had to adopt the means of new idealism to fabricate exemplary figures. From this, it can be seen that the fabrication of characters is a necessary thing in non-aesthetic life literature; if there are ready-made models available, it is not only easier, but also more realistic and easier to move people.</p>
<p>Now it's great, for more than a year and a half since the official start of the War of Resistance, in the fierce struggle of national revolution, many loyal and brave soldiers who charged forward in the front, bathed in blood and fought the enemy, are models for the youth in the rear. The stories of generous and passionate martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the country are good materials to encourage future generations. Moreover, the activities of the guerrillas who struggle hard everywhere, and the various experiences of their victories and failures, can all be used as reference materials for the general public, as their role models, inspiring them to participate in the war, or to prepare practically to prevent enemy invasion. These facts, although they are already past, are ideal things that people who have not been involved in them are eager to obtain. To adopt themes from ideals is nothing more than because the existing facts are not enough; with so many vivid facts, why not use them?</p>
<p>Works that record these new facts are new realist works; although they are "reproductions," they have the same "expression" function as general new idealist works. Not only can it be used as an exemplary propaganda tool among the majority of people in our country, but it can also be promoted to various oppressed and weak nations for active use. Because these facts are all exemplary acts of unity, struggle, resistance to the strong, and self-defense.</p>
<p>The so-called new realist literature is not new in the writing method, but new in the nature of the theme. Moreover, this "new" is not just "recent," but focuses on resisting tyranny and supporting the weak, and jointly maintaining justice and humanity. New realist works were rarely seen before, except for Soviet literature, because such facts were only abundant in the Great Revolution in the Soviet Union. Later, we can also have many new realist literature, although the nature is slightly different, but the function of realism that can demonstrate and inspire is the same. Whether it is the firm and resilient spirit in "The Iron Flood," or the spirit of not being afraid of sacrifice in "The Rout" and "The Forty-First," we have it all. Not to mention the experience of fighting hard for ten years and marching ten thousand miles; the facts of the Eight Hundred Heroes and the Lushan Lone Army fighting in distress, as well as the selfless heroic deeds of loyal and brave soldiers on various battlefields, can all be written into moving masterpieces.</p>
<p>The large number of new realist literature appearing in our country will become a by-product of the War of Resistance Against Japan.</p>
<h3>In the Rear (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Wu Yi</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>A nurse leads the way, and a group of children bounces in, chattering and laughing. They are the children's choir from a nearby elementary school. They come every day to sing a few songs to relieve our boredom.</p>
<p>After singing three group songs, (1) Party Song; (2) Salute to the Warriors; (3) Long Live China. Miss Peng, as usual, holding the medicine tray in one hand and the child named Jiji in the other, walks over to our side.</p>
<p>I say, "Jiji, come and sing a nice song for old Niu."</p>
<p>So Jiji runs over familiarly, leans his little body on my bed rail, and sings:</p>
<p>Tell your mother not to grieve, not to grieve,</p>
<p>When we win,</p>
<p>We will return to our hometown in triumph——</p>
<p>"Jiji, don't you know how to dance? The old folks will love you if you dance, they will catch the ×× Japanese devils for you. Dance again, be good." Miss Peng says with a smile.</p>
<p>Jiji is really good. He rolls his little black eyes, then raises his little voice and continues to sing:</p>
<p>"Rush over, …snatch over, don't look back, don't linger…"</p>
<p>While thrusting his white, chubby little fist forward again and again. We all forget the pain and turn over to laugh. Miss Peng claps her hands and says Jiji dances well! I also say:</p>
<p>"Good! Don't look back, don't linger…"</p>
<p>But Jiji climbs on my bedside and says that he can sing a song that no one else can sing. Miss Peng asks him to sing, but Jiji refuses. I ask Miss Peng to take out an empty bullet casing from my pocket and give it to him. Only then does a dimple appear on Jiji's red face, and he sings:</p>
<p>Fight ××, fight ××,</p>
<p>Take back Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang,</p>
<p>Drive the ×× one by one into the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>Jiji, remember, Jilin is our country, our hometown</p>
<p>"Jiji, who taught you this song?" I ask as if I have a strange feeling.</p>
<p>"Daddy taught it, Mommy wanted me to memorize it." Jiji says.</p>
<p>"What does your daddy do?" I ask very kindly, reaching out my good hand to pull Jiji.</p>
<p>"Um," unexpectedly, Jiji raises his little head and reveals a puzzled look; but then he says: "Mommy told me that Daddy went home because no one was taking care of the house and bandits were going to rob things." He also says, "Daddy is like old Niu, I remember Daddy also has a big scar on his face."</p>
<p>Really, Jiji loves to play with the old bruises on my face, and Miss Peng is always anxious because she is afraid of hurting my wound. I say:</p>
<p>"Jiji, I also have a big boy at home, just like you, white and chubby. He also hides a lot of bullet casings that I brought back for him."</p>
<p>So Jiji says to me very affectionately:</p>
<p>"Dad also kept bullet casings for me. When we defeat the dwarfs, you bring him over to compare with me, and we'll make friends, and I'll call Dad back to be an old friend for you." He also tells me not to forget.</p>
<p>Amidst the suppressed groans of laughter from the old folks, Miss Peng takes Jiji back to his team. After that, every time Jiji comes, he always mentions making friends with the dwarf and Xiao Niu, and also tells me: he has already learned "shoulder arms" and "order arms." And asks if Xiao Niu knows them, and if he does, in the future, we can join the army together to fight the dwarfs, and we can抢(qiang, lit: grab, but implied to "get a hold of") a real foreign gun like everyone else.</p>
<h3>Bubbles</h3>
<p>A novella</p>
<h3>Amidst the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>However, the people in Hupuzhen, who were accustomed to a comfortable life, did not take it seriously. Moreover, Tu Dong, Yang Yue, and Liang were secretly undermining them, saying that Regiment Commander Ye was intentionally exaggerating to scare them, and that his purpose was just to use this topic to solicit money from the people in the town, so the people did not take Regiment Commander Ye's words to heart even more. Regiment Commander Ye saw that those who spoke earnestly were ignored, and he could only sigh silently. He had already controlled all the ships on the shore of Taihu Lake, but at this time, he hired a civilian boat to move food and some household items onto the boat. When Old Mr. Ye asked him what this meant, he said with a sigh:</p>
<p>"People are not good for a thousand days, and flowers are not red for a hundred days. I can't say that I will always be able to protect this hometown. If the situation is critical, and my parents are already old, they can't endure the suffering of retreating with the army, so I can only ask you to take refuge in Taihu Lake for a while. There are our guerrilla teams in the East and West Dongting Mountains and Maji Mountain in Taihu Lake. Going there, there will always be some small care."</p>
<p>Old Mr. Ye did not quite understand the situation outside. He even felt that Regiment Commander Ye's actions were a bit too neurotic.</p>
<p>However, the facts proved that Regiment Commander Ye's actions were prophetic. Time quickly arrived at the Lunar New Year, and the people in Hupuzhen were celebrating wildly because each store had a surplus at the end of the year, so everyone voluntarily pooled money to build a solid stage in the Baoen Temple in the town, and hired a traveling performing troupe to perform a grand opera for five days and five nights to thank the gods. On the third day of the New Year. Just when everyone was watching the opera with great concentration in the Baoen Temple, shoulder to shoulder and back to back, suddenly, the air raid alarm bell on the observation tower began to ring wildly, "Dang dang."</p>
<p>However, the sound of the alarm was drowned out by the sound of the New Year gongs and drums from each household, and the sound of the big gongs and drums on the stage. Regiment Commander Ye was more attentive after all. When he heard the bell, he knew that something was wrong, and when he heard the sound of the gongs and drums on the stage still ringing loudly, he hurriedly took the megaphone himself to disperse the people in Baoen Temple.</p>
<p>The opera "Baishuitan" was being performed on the stage, with Shi Yi Lang fighting Qingmianhu, and the gongs and drums were pounding loudly, and the audience under the stage were cheering loudly, completely unaware that danger was approaching. Regiment Commander Ye squeezed through the crowd for a long time, and finally managed to squeeze to the front of the stage. He hurriedly shouted to stop the gongs on the stage, jumped onto the stage, and held the megaphone to say to everyone:</p>
<p>"Enemy planes are coming! Everyone go home and hide in the air raid shelter." (30)</p>

<h3>Starting from the Price Increase of Public Utilities</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>Hoping that the public utility authorities adopt fewer passive remedial measures, hoping that the bosses hoarding daily necessities can weigh the pros and cons, and hoping that people who cannot maintain their livelihoods go to the interior as much as possible</p>
<p>In recent years, Shanghai's public utilities seem to be living in a recession amidst prosperity; tap water and electricity have both successively increased in price due to unbalanced revenues and expenditures. The power company also implemented a 10% increase from this month, which was a gradual increase among the 32.5% increase previously requested. Amidst this wave of increases, the Municipal Council's municipal general tax, land tax, etc. also followed suit, increasing by 2%.</p>
<p>In reality, the income of various businesses has been better than in the past due to the concentration of population and increased consumption in the concession; however, what are the reasons and justifications for the price increase of various public utilities? To sum it up in one sentence: "Tightening of foreign exchange." Because Shanghai's public utilities in various departments are operated by Westerners, and most of the raw materials they use are transported from abroad, and most of the middle and upper-level employees they hire are also Westerners. At present, the cost of materials transported from abroad is high, and the salaries earned by Western employees and remitted back to their hometowns have been reduced by a certain amount compared to normal times. In order to stabilize the lives of employees, the authorities have created "exchange subsidies" and "cost of living subsidies." Under these circumstances, its own expenditures naturally exceed income, and it needs to increase prices to make up for it.</p>
<p>However, the price increase of public utilities is not the same as the price increase of goods. The impact it gives to society is to raise the overall standard of living in the city, making it impossible for various departments such as industry and commerce to maintain the original price due to huge expenditures. In recent months, the price of imported goods has indeed risen a lot, and the price of domestic goods has also risen again and again. Daily necessities rise, and non-daily necessities also rise. The newly purchased raw materials or goods rise, and the raw materials or goods stockpiled several years ago also rise: coupled with manipulation, hoarding, speculation, and other abnormal states and methods, so that in addition to "rising," there is also a "shortage." The bosses who hoard goods are all smiling, and last year became a prosperous year for the industrial and commercial circles, and part of the reason lies in this.</p>
<p>However, from the perspective of the internal situation of the lives of ordinary citizens, the price increase of non-essential high-priced imported goods and luxury goods does not have a very serious impact on the lives of most citizens, because non-daily essential imported goods do not hinder life; only after the price of daily essential things rises, the pressure given to citizens is really deep and huge! Although the clothing, food, and housing in the three items of clothing, food, and housing are flexible in terms of quality, they must always be maintained to the degree of warmth and satiety in terms of quantity. Tightening the belt to live is, after all, a joke. However, now the price of coarse cloth is higher than the price of fine cloth in the past, and vegetables have also increased by an unknown number of times compared to the past (the price of rice has also soared in recent days), not to mention chicken, duck, fish, meat, silk, and rent, etc.</p>
<p>The standard of living has gradually risen, but the income of ordinary small citizens and salaried classes has been just the opposite. What we hear is "layoffs and salary cuts" in the east and "leave of absence" in the west; those who served in the war zone in the past and are now trapped in the circle of unemployment are really countless, living in a state where production and consumption go against each other.</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported in the newspaper that our government is currently in consultation with HSBC Bank to crack down on the black market for foreign exchange in Shanghai. We naturally look forward to its success, and at the same time, we also hope that the public utility authorities adopt fewer passive remedial measures, and hope that the bosses who hoard daily necessities weigh the pros and cons, and stop at the right time, and do not just have a distorted idea of "making more money" in their minds, then the lives of the general public will not be affected by fluctuations.</p>
<p>In addition, we also hope that people who cannot maintain the minimum standard of living go to the interior as much as possible to seek a living, because the prices of everything in the interior are regular, unlike Shanghai, which is so unrestricted; as long as you are determined to wear and use local products, you will not live in a daze and fear rising prices every day.</p>
<h3>Feng Yumei (2)</h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>Scene Three</p>
<p>(The leader and four henchmen escort Dan onstage, Dan cries. Xiao Sheng Heng comes onstage, looks at Dan, speaks to the leader, says) Hey, you bold slaves, how dare you rob women from the people? (The leader whispers) I originally wanted to dedicate her to King Fan. Who knew that Fan Xizhou this kid wanted to get a piece of the action! Okay, let him take this advantage, it can be considered a personal favor! (Says to Xiao Sheng) I say, Master Fan, since you like her, I'll give her to you. (Xiao Sheng) Nonsense! Hurry up and retreat! (The leader) Yes! It is truly: Wasted my life fighting with swords, carrying water with a bamboo basket, all for naught. (The leader and henchmen all leave) (Xiao Sheng) I will personally untie her! (Dan turns her back to the right and ignores him) Young lady, you've been frightened! Xiao Sheng greets you here! (Xiao Sheng goes to the right and bows, Dan turns her back to the left again) Miss,喏喏喏, Xiao Sheng greets you here too! (Dan) Kill me if you want, no need for more words. (Xiao Sheng) Miss, allow Xiao Sheng to say a word. (Dan) Who would talk to you, a bandit! (Xiao Sheng) I, Xiao Sheng, am not willing to be a bandit…… (Dan) Hmph, now that the Jin are invading the south, the country is in a time of crisis. Since you are not willing to be a bandit, you should surrender to the Song Dynasty, work together to resist foreign aggression. Fine words and pretty phrases, who would believe you. I hate it so! (Sings) Now that the country is at war with foreign enemies, how can we bear internal worries; although you are not a Jin dog, you are actually helping the Jin chief. The country is harmed by your hands, still uttering flowery words. Saying you are not willing to be a bandit, not even a three-year-old child would fall for it. (Xiao Sheng) Miss! Miss, calm down, listen to me! (Sings) It's all because of the famine, the people fled; therefore, my uncle gathered people in the mountains. My family was forced to follow, all surnamed Fan, determined to escape the net, harder than hard. I will also use great righteousness to encourage him; acting as bandits, harming the people, committing all kinds of evil; it is better to wash your hands, disperse the henchmen; surrender to the Song Dynasty to resist foreign aggression, and vow to sweep away the stench. (Dan turns around, lowers her head towards Xiao Sheng) If that's the case, you haven't lost your conscience. (Raises her neck, looking at Xiao Sheng very heroic, with an expression of admiration and joy) You want to persuade Fan Ruwei to surrender to the Song Dynasty, if he doesn't listen, what will you do…? (Xiao Sheng) Then I…… (Dan waits for his reply) um… (Xiao Sheng) Then I…… there's nothing I can do! (Dan) Alas, in my opinion, if he doesn't listen, you should take the opportunity with your confidant generals to escape and join Yue Fei's army to attack the Jin! (Xiao Sheng) I'm afraid that won't work! (Dan) What won't work? (Xiao Sheng) If I'm caught by King Fan, wouldn't there be a risk to my life? (Dan) Then there's no need to say anything, I'll know you for who you are! (Dan turns her head slightly, angry) (Xiao Sheng) Wait, wait, but you must be discreet, or you may be lucky enough to escape. (Dan turns around towards Xiao Sheng) That is true. As a person, one must do what is right, and life and death can be put aside. Those who are not afraid of death will not necessarily die, the more you are afraid of death, the more you cannot escape! (Xiao Sheng) Miss's words have enlightened me. I will definitely plan and act, and live up to your expectations. (Dan raises her head towards Xiao Sheng, grasping his sleeve in gratitude) Is this true? (Xiao Sheng) It's true. (Dan) Really? (Xiao Sheng) Really. (Dan) Then accept my bow! Xiao Sheng helps her up) You mustn't, you mustn't! (Dan) I'm not bowing to you, I'm bowing to the fact that our country has another loyal and devoted man, the Great Song Dynasty is saved! (Xiao Sheng) I'm ashamed, I'm ashamed! Miss, please sit! (Dan) Have a seat, please sit! (Xiao Sheng) Have a seat! Xiao Sheng and Miss met by chance, it's truly a blessing in three lifetimes. It seems that Miss is a daughter of an official family, may I ask your name? (Dan) My surname is Feng, my given name is Yumei. Passing through Jianzhou with my father, I didn't expect to be forcibly taken here by bandits, I don't know when I'll see my father again, hehehe! (Cries) (Xiao Sheng) Miss, there's no need to cry. Xiao Sheng Fan Xizhou is also from a scholarly family, I haven't achieved fame yet, I'm staying here temporarily. I didn't expect to meet Miss, it can be said to be a match made in heaven. If you don't dislike me, I'm willing to be together, I'll slowly find your father. (Dan whispers) Things have come to this, it seems that this person is also a kind person, young and handsome, forced to be here; moreover, he has great ambitions to serve the country, it's better to follow him, so that I can encourage him at any time, and I won't waste my Feng Yumei's patriotic heart! (Says to Xiao Sheng) I am lucky to be alive, I will rely on you to protect me. (Xiao Sheng) Since you agree, I am overjoyed! Xiao Sheng has an ancestral treasure mirror, which is a mirror that opens and closes, clear and bright, with two characters, "鸳鸯" (Yuanyang, Mandarin Duck, a symbol of lovers), cast in it, called the Yuanyang Treasure Mirror. I'll cut off one side and give the other side to Miss as a betrothal gift. (Takes out the mirror and gives it to her, Dan accepts the mirror) Let's go home. Truly: We met by chance like old friends, (Dan) The Mandarin Duck together. (Xiao Sheng) If I can fulfill my lifelong wish, I'll kill the barbarian with ten thousand knives! (Together they leave)</p>
<h3>Night University</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Wealthy families have the financial means to send their children to university, even abroad to study, returning with a gilded reputation. However, these children often lack ambition, using studying as a facade for idleness, failing to even obtain a high school diploma. On the other hand, children from poor families are often intelligent and ambitious, eager to graduate from university, but their families' financial resources are insufficient, forcing them to drop out midway. At best, they graduate from high school and must leave school to find work. This seems to have become a set formula, making one feel the unfairness of creation and question why humanity must have rich and poor.</p>
<p>A young person, due to circumstances, cannot receive an ideal education. Once they leave school and enter society, they often encounter difficulties in handling matters due to insufficient knowledge. Sometimes, due to qualifications, they perform the same work but have a lower status and receive less pay than others. The pain and resentment felt when encountering such situations are unknown to those who have not experienced them.</p>
<p>Any ambitious young person in such an environment, driven by determination, can only resolve to improve their education by studying in their spare time. However, most tutoring schools are at the secondary level. Many working young people already have a secondary education and wish to study in the evenings while working during the day. They often find that tutoring schools lack university-level subjects, and despite their ambition, they have nowhere to study.</p>
<p>Indeed, all universities originally held classes during the day. However, perhaps educators have also recognized the frustration of working young people feeling inadequate in their academic abilities and having nowhere to study. In the city of Shanghai, there are several universities that offer classes at night, which is what this article refers to as night universities. This allows you to serve society while simultaneously seeking progress, using your spare time to work during the day and study at night.</p>
<p>Speaking of night universities, the oldest and most established in Shanghai is probably Soochow University. However, Soochow only offers law courses, and the qualifications are very strict, requiring a university preparatory school diploma to be eligible for the entrance exam. After graduation, the qualifications are exactly the same as those for daytime university students. Due to the qualification requirements, many working young people who have graduated from secondary schools may sigh in despair, unable to apply. However, historically, Soochow's night university has provided a great opportunity for many working young people who had attended university but dropped out midway and entered society. Over the years, Soochow has indeed produced many great lawyers.</p>
<p>Following Soochow, Chih Tze Law School, Shanghai Law College, and Political Science College also offered evening classes, naturally producing many legal talents. In addition to law, the National School of Commerce once offered evening classes, but later, due to the Ministry of Education's revision of university regulations, evening classes were severely restricted, so the School of Commerce canceled its evening courses. After the "January 28th Incident," the late President Liu Zhan'en of Shanghai University, in order to provide a place for good young people to study in their spare time and receive a university education, founded the Shanghai University Downtown Business School on Yuemingyuan Road, focusing on commerce and offering specialized journalism courses and special courses. Classes started at 5 p.m. every day. At one point, five or six hundred ambitious young people used their spare time to attend Shanghai University's night university. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the Ministry of Education's regulations, the night school was not officially registered, which inevitably made the students feel dissatisfied.</p>
<p>I myself attended night university for two years, going to class every evening. I saw many working young people who served in government agencies or foreign firms, leaving their offices at 5 p.m., carrying their books, and hurrying to school for classes. Everyone was in a rush, entering the school gate one after another, afraid of being late. If there were several nights with three or four classes in a row, they would study on an empty stomach, only returning home to eat dinner at nine or ten o'clock. In the classroom, everyone quietly buried their heads listening to the professor's lecture. This spirit is not found in students attending daytime schools.</p>
<p>After the "August 13th Incident," several universities in Nanshi and Zhabei were unable to hold classes. Some moved inland, while others moved into the concessions. However, due to the overcrowding in the concessions, school buildings became a problem. Several universities could not find school buildings, so they borrowed school buildings from secondary schools for classes. However, those secondary schools also needed to hold their own classes, so they could only lend out their school buildings after their own classes, forcing the universities temporarily borrowing school buildings to start classes only after 4 p.m. Many courses were scheduled in the evening. In this way, daytime universities temporarily seemed to have become night universities as well.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Spring Arrives in the Emerald Green, Fragrance Floats on the Snowy Sea; Flowers Fly from Tiger Hill, the Moon Fills Li Lake</p>
<p>He Liyu asked, "Where are your two cousins now?" Wu Junsu said, "The elder one is a pilot, and the younger one graduated from artillery school. These two cousins are the most able to endure hardship and the most hard-working people. If it weren't for this war, I'm afraid they would have just become two idle friends, developing into spoiled young masters. So this great war has created many useful people." Wu Junsu was a talkative person, and once she opened the floodgates, she could talk for hours. They sat in the "Idly Clouds" pavilion, watching the white clouds on the lake, freely rolling and unfurling, truly feeling the leisurely atmosphere. He Shuangyu held a cup of tea in her hand, the green color appearing lovely in the glass cup. She asked, "Does Suzhou also produce tea?" Wu Junsu said, "It does produce some, but very little. The largest two peaks of the seventy-two peaks of Taihu Lake in Suzhou are also called Dongting Mountain. They produce a kind of tea called Biluochun, which has a very elegant name. The annual production is not much, but recently the tea farmers there have been promoting trial planting, and the production is already more than before." He Shuangyu said, "Ah! What a lovely name. The three characters 'Biluochun' already make one's mouth water. Is there anywhere to buy Biluochun?" Wu Junsu said, "It's just that the name sounds nice, but the tea itself is just so-so. I'm not particular about drinking tea. People who are particular don't call it drinking tea, but 'tasting tea.' I heard that people in your hometown are very particular about tasting tea. They not only pay attention to the tea leaves, but also to the water. The most particular is using snow water collected from plum blossoms to brew tea. That's really something that idle people and carefree friends do." Wei Airen said, "That's right! It reminds me! This Stone Lake is very close to Guangfu Xuanmu. If the two elder sisters come here when the lunar year ends and spring returns, we can go to Xuanmu together to see the plum blossoms. That place is full of white plum blossoms. When they are in full bloom, from a distance, it looks like a vast expanse of white, forming a sea of flowers. When you get closer, standing under tens of thousands of plum blossoms, it's as if you're immersed in a sea of fragrance, truly feeling the subtle and inconceivable. That's why someone gave that place a name, calling it Fragrant Snow Sea." Wu Junsu said, "Dr. Zhu, when have you ever been there? Your description is so wonderful, full of poetic sense." Zhu Airen smiled and said, "Are only you literary people allowed to have a pen that can convey the essence and wonder? Anyone can feel the beautiful scenery." Wu Junsu said, "Don't worry! I know that the two He sisters won't be returning to Guangdong anytime soon. We can just accompany them on trips." (57)</p>

<h3>International Film News</h3>
<p>— (Zhang Peiying)</p>
<p>Italian Films Banned Everywhere, Japanese Stars Rejected, Soviet Film Industry Advances Rapidly, New Changes in British Film Industry, Patriotic Films of Overseas Chinese in the Netherlands, Lin Yutang Writes Screenplays in America, Film City Resists Fascism</p>
<p>(1) Sorini, the former founder of "Film Village" in the Italian capital, specializes in producing films publicizing the dynamics of Italy's dictatorial state. Last year, a total of 184 such films were produced and shipped abroad for screening. Only 18 were screened in the United States, 44 in Britain, and the most, of course, were screened in his comrade's country—Germany, with 72. The rest were banned.</p>
<p>(2) Japanese actress Uemura Yae, who has been with Paramount Pictures in the United States for seven or eight years, was recently abruptly dismissed by the company. The reason is that after the Sino-Japanese War, her films suffered a disastrous drop in box office revenue, which displeased the company. It is said to be unprecedented for foreign actors in Hollywood to be rejected.</p>
<p>(3) Since the completion of the Soviet Union's second Five-Year Plan, its film industry has also advanced rapidly. It is currently producing over 40,000 reels of new films for screening at the 1939 New York World's Fair. These short films will allow foreign audiences to understand the Soviet Union's overview and its national strength.</p>
<p>(4) There has recently been a significant change in the British film industry. An enterprise group called Philips Joint Enterprise Company is preparing to acquire 600 to 700 cinemas throughout Britain. At the same time, an Odeon company is also preparing to acquire 300 cinemas belonging to Gaumont Film Company. It is speculated that there are some wealthy Jewish tycoons who fled from Germany supporting this organization behind the scenes, which is why it has such strong capital.</p>
<p>(5) There are many overseas Chinese in the Netherlands, so domestically produced films originally occupied a considerable position in the Netherlands. After the outbreak of the war, Cantonese films monopolized the entire market, which reduced the enthusiasm of overseas Chinese for believing in their motherland. Therefore, everyone hopes that Shanghai's Mandarin films can be shipped there as soon as possible.</p>
<p>(6) The famous Chinese humorist Lin Yutang is traveling in the United States, engaged in writing and screenwriting, which is popular for a time and well-received by foreigners. Recently, he also wrote a new script for child star Shirley Temple, titled "The Little Craftsman," which is about to begin filming. This is the first time a Chinese person has written a screenplay in Hollywood.</p>
<p>(7) Hollywood filmmakers have recently been vigorously producing films about war to cater to the psychology of people around the world.</p>
<p>(8) Anti-fascist activities in the United States are also clearly expressed and strongly supported in Hollywood. According to statistics, 15,000 film workers have joined the Anti-Fascist Committee (including stars such as Paul Muni and Louise Rainer, who starred in "The Good Earth"). The call for aid to China and Spain has shaken the entire silver city.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City's Liyuan (116)</h3>
<p>Sun Laoyuan Can Snuff While Playing the Erhu</p>
<p>First, his fingering is good, his voice is rounded, the sound of the erhu is bright, the decorations are pleasant, the connection is seamless like a coat, and the break is like chopping nails and cutting iron. As for playing the erhu in the lower position, it is his specialty. These advantages aside, just his skill in tuning the strings is that two "ga ga" sounds are enough. When the singer opens his mouth, it just matches the tune he needs, without making any mistakes. This is a hundred times better than the situation where ordinary people cannot tune the instrument properly, no matter how hard they try, and stare blankly at the stage when the singer opens his mouth. In addition, his quickness in connecting the strings is also difficult for others to match.</p>
<p>One day, Shu Yan sang the complete "Empty City Stratagem." That day, the seats were full, and Shu Yan's voice was particularly good. I and several friends got middle seats in the first three rows, and we could hear it particularly clearly. Sun Lao wore an old-fashioned velvet mandarin jacket, kept a yellow beard in the style of Yang Xiang Wu, and carried a black erhu. As soon as he sat down facing the stage, he heard applause throughout the hall. He expected that among the people who came today, there must be some connoisseurs. In "Losing Jieting," apart from the "Two Countries Battle Dragons and Tigers" segment, the other segments that are played fast and sung slowly are difficult to show his strengths. But when the slow beat on the city tower began, he truly had a place to use his skills. The singing was good and had not stopped, and the good erhu playing followed. Sun Lao became happier and happier. When Shu Yan sang the seventh sentence, "King Wen of Zhou visited Jiang Shang and the Zhou Dynasty greatly prospered," he took advantage of the moment when the "prosper" character needed a long tone, and suddenly used his right middle finger to rub some snuff on the ivory snuff dish placed on his left knee. At the moment when he lifted the bow upward, he quickly inhaled the snuff on his right middle finger into both nostrils. It was quick and natural, without affecting Shu Yan's singing and his accompaniment at all. At this time, I saw it very clearly at the stage entrance, and I couldn't help but yelled "Bravo" several times. Of course, it wasn't just me who saw it, and everyone else also started cheering. His trick can be considered divine. Now, twenty years later, when I close my eyes and think about it, it's as if it's right in front of me.</p>
<p>Writing Shadows of the Dance Troupe (13)</p>
<p>— Xiaotian</p>
<h3>Dance Girl Sketches, Section 5</h3>
<p>Among dance girls, there is a common psychology regarding the issue of their future destination. This psychology cannot be considered improper. As the saying goes, "A tree grows to a thousand feet, but the leaves fall back to their roots." It can also be said that it is a common psychology among people in general, not just dance girls.</p>
<p>Speaking of the backgrounds of dance girls, it can be said that they are complex. There are daughters of ordinary families, and there are also daughters of noble families; there are female students who have attended school; and there are also kiln transformations of prostitutes; some are families who cannot afford food and clothing, and have no choice but to let their children do this career; and some are abducted by bandits, sold around and forced to make this living; there are all kinds of people, and it is difficult to describe them all. Because their knowledge is uneven, their wishes are also different. Some say: "I would rather be a blade of grass in the courtyard than a small person in someone else's house." Some say: "Whether you do big or small is your own destiny. If you have good luck, you marry into someone's house and are a small person, but soon the big person in their house dies. If you have bad luck, the man marries you and you are the big person, but soon the second and third wives come in one after another. As the saying goes, 'To marry a husband, you must be of one heart; there is no need to be a lady in the hall.'" This is the difference between wanting to be a wife or a concubine. Some believe that marrying a man is for enjoying glory and wealth, so they don't ask about the other person's character or appearance. Even if they are seventy or eighty years old, as long as they have money to support my enjoyment, I can marry them. Some believe that marrying someone is a matter of a lifetime, and they must be handsome in appearance and gentle in nature to be considered qualified. As for the issue of whether they have money or not, that is a small matter. This is the difference between pursuing material enjoyment and spiritual enjoyment. There is another view, which is the most common among dance girls, that the dance guests' visit to the dance hall is just for entertainment purposes. For the dance girls, it is just playing around. When they are tired of playing, they will change to another one. There is no question of a lifelong commitment at all. Therefore, the dance girls should adopt a money-first and pleasure-seeking attitude towards the dance guests. When they see someone with money, they should squeeze some money out of them. When they meet someone beautiful, they should seek pleasure. If they meet someone who is both rich and beautiful, then they might as well seek pleasure and squeeze money at the same time. If they encounter someone who is stingy and ugly, they might as well be straightforward and kick them away. Pimp around today, whore around tomorrow, and just seek immediate happiness. As for the issue of the future, we'll talk about it in the future. This kind of doctrine, it cannot be said that she is wrong, nor can it be said that she is right. In short, the ending is still mostly bitter. There is another view, which can be said to be extremely rare among dance girls, that they were born at the wrong time, which led them to fall into the dust. How can they abandon themselves again? What I sell is a pair of feet, and I definitely don't want my soul and body. Holding on to this principle, they protect their chastity like jade. Every day, the dance hall is filled with people, a sea of people. How can there not be a single person to entrust their whole life to? Whenever a dance guest's solicitation gradually becomes frequent and they are not stingy or ugly, they will question them thoroughly. They will not sacrifice their chastity until they have carefully examined their character and have agreed on marriage. However, I have seen this kind of person but have not heard her speak. I have heard her speak but have not distinguished the truth from the falsehood. I will write about it here, so that it can be classified as one of the types.</p>
<p>He Tianjian Lecturing on Traditional Chinese Painting The traditional Chinese painter He Tianjian, in view of the decline of painting theory and practice, founded the Chinese Painting Association with his colleagues within ten years, and edited the Chinese Painting Monthly and Painting Studies Monthly, exhausting his efforts in the hope of reversing the situation. The atmosphere in the country gradually changed. He realized that it was still difficult to implement his ideas without practical work, so he began to personally teach students. It is heard that He Tianjian, in response to the demands of those who are interested in learning to paint, will officially teach students this spring. They can also learn all subjects, regardless of gender, and is limited to ten students. The application period is from March 10th to April 10th. The address is No. 29, Paris New Village, Luban Road, 3rd Floor. Detailed information can be obtained at any time.</p>

<p>According to this game, after the first competition of the Cultural and Educational Center in the past, Mr. Xie Junxun requested Mr. Chen and Mr. Lian to perform. At that time, there were about 3,000 spectators. By the 48th move, when Rook 6 retreated 1, the audience applauded like thunder. Mr. Lian's 52nd move, Rook 6 to 4, was particularly brilliant, making it impossible for Mr. Chen to cope. It was not easy. Mr. Lian is a veteran of the chess world, having been diligently engaged in this field for more than 30 years. He is experienced. This game also shows a glimpse of it.</p>
