<p>社評</p>
<h3>醞釀中之國際</h3>
<p>中日戰事，遠東大局，乃至一般國際之禍福安危，胥以、今後之短時期爲重要之醖釀時期。</p>
<p>吾人不欲奢言吾人所信之醖釀結局，抑且醖釀之後，或以一方面或數方面之倒行逆施而如水益深，如火益熱；然目前所醞釀，確有產生良好結果之可能，亦爲追求良好結果之機會；究將如何趨歸，端視理智之倫如何努力。而吾人所欲大聲疾呼者，務望世界各國理智之倫，聲應氣求，就共通而公道之原則，協力邁進！</p>
<p>云何共通而公道之原則？或以爲主義，以爲但求一種主義之行遍寰宇，寰宇自成一家，此實永遠絕不可能之痴想。姑莫謂共產主義國社主義法西主義之各有所宗，祇能任其自生自滅於其部落之內，充極其量，使部落之四周略受沾染；姑莫謂共產與國社法西之若水火，即國社法西亦豈能使德義兩國化合一統；若民治主義者，吾人所宗信，吾人衷誠擁戴之爲文明人類政制思想之正統，然欲以民治主義消滅『異端』，則又何必！故以主義爲號召，或以『反』某主義爲號召，皆不足爲共通而公道之原則；此其一。或以爲和平，以爲和平乃人類共通之企求，和平之下，公道伸焉；此非無政府主義之假定極則，即爲黷武主義之假定極則。蓋和平有其必不可缺之條件，無政府主義者以不和平之原因業已完全消滅爲條件，黷武主義者以對抗之勢力終歸完全消滅爲條件，是可得乎？和平條件，厥惟公道。舍公道而求和平，祇有捷克徒爲和平之犧牲，未見英國乃爲公道之護法。日本作不公道之侵略，遂毀和平；中國爲不屈服於不公道而抗戰，遂不苟於和平。可知不顧一切而漫言和平，決非人類共通而公道之原則；此其二。二者爲國際之狡黠者，昏憒者，凶暴者，卑怯者，各就所方便而取爲標榜，皆非也。</p>
<p>國際共通而公道之原則惟何？卑之無論：各自把握其主權領土行政之完整，尊重他國主權領土行政之完整，援助他國保持主權領土行政之完整；如此而已，如此而已」，一切國際舉措，適合此目標者，極是極正，觸牴此目標者，極曲極謬；爲極是極正而協力努力，爲糾正極曲極謬而協力努力；此爲世界各國理智之倫所應排除萬難，準備犧牲與痛苦，而惟力是視以赴之。抑吾人何爲好整以暇，作此老生常談？則以此共通而公道之原則，理所應爾而顚撲不破；然蓄意破壞者有之，　頇而忽視者有之，顧近利小利而姑息放任者有之，懾於强暴，習於逸樂而不敢正視此目標者亦有之；復有人焉，或以人口爲言，或以經濟為言，或以歷史中之某一頁某一片段爲言，誇妄之某一種傳統神話爲言，謂他國主權領土行政應予毀滅，應予减縮，應予變更改造；此非詭辯，即是錯覺，蓋主權領土行政有必然之界說，有確然之事實，有昭然之範圍；而彼藉以爲言者，沒無標準，徒以掩其野心而已。謂人口經濟等等，自成問題，有待解決，則亦應公道解決之於完整之主權領土行政之下。錯覺自誤誤人，詭辯自欺欺人，顧國際糾紛方與之相映焉。老生常談蓋可已乎？</p>
<p>察之今日國際之現象：除中日兩國戰爭，爲決定前途之確實行動，中國允屬義無返顧，是無待論；此外，（一）美國鮮明强毅，近作適合上述共通而公道之原則之初步表示；吾人深信美國之必循是而進，使上述原則發揚光大，奠定之爲國際永久且堅强之基礎。然祗此初步表示，決非止境；自初步以迄完成、其問甚有距離；求短縮空間之距離，要在繼以有效之行動；求短縮時間之距離，要在行動之敏捷果敢。美國固將何如行動乎？將何時行動乎？盛傳美國當局方靜觀時變，再定步驟；觀國內輿情者一，觀日本反應者二，觀歐局演進者三；夫謀國之須鄭重沉着，是所應爾，然位置領導國際，而勢居舉足重輕之國家，必以醖釀主動作爲爲貴；若多遷延，或且誤解之猶疑而無決心，誤解初步表示爲虛聲恫嚇，則靜觀之過矣。（二）英國方有爲於東京莫斯科；以莫斯科談判而論，吾人甯同情於英國之委屈求全，但若彼前首相勞合喬治對此猶攻訐張伯倫，則其間殆有不可諒之內情歟？是何內情，久於醞釀！以東京談判而論，前作初步協定，其情容有可原，其跡絕無可恕；國際事，動關現實，必著利害，故必論跡而不論情；夫誰有恩怨成見，是則譽之友之，非則斥之棄之，故必絲毫無所假借；彼初步協定所受舉世責難，自屬咎由自取；然一一三日來所傳英國態度頗能硬朗，行見爲舉世所稱許；雖然，至目前爲止，諸未確定，英國在東京之外交步哨，固將爲遠東權益以及國際共通而公道之原則作不屈不撓之戰鬥乎？抑將捐權益，違原則，自絕於四萬五千萬之友好民族而退至新加坡乎？此則短時期內必見分曉，在此未分曉之日，雖與英國最友善者，亦惟有以客觀論證之曰，取捨從違在醖釀中也、（三）日本之於遠東，志切主宰而理有所虧，力有未逮，然在今日糾紛之中，其進退機樞固得自爲操持運用，非若中國之迫不得已而惟抗戰圖存者也。以國際共通而公道之原則衡之，日本無是處，事屬應退；然日本式之思想理論，以敎育關係，以傳統之態度關係，似爲夙昔未嘗理解此項原則。中國毅然抗戰，既未能啟發其理解；各國在道德上雖示以僧惡，而經濟上政治上往還周旋之不已，於彼暴行忍受忍耐之不已，此允蔽塞其應有之理解：是以日本之深入歧途，實力消損，雖彼自誤，亦各國誤之也。及至今日，日本能吾虛衷接受上述原則而幡然改圖，吾人猶無論證之新資料；然美國鮮明强毅之初步表示，至少亦足使日本恍然於美國非能優容日本之所作爲；日前路透社東京電謂日本歷來對美國之誤解，至是而打碎無遺云云，必紀實也。繼美國之初步表示者，美國輿情超越黨爭而稱頌政府矣，是舉國一致也，世界輿情異口同聲而稱頌美國矣，是舉世一致也，英國態度以强硬聞矣，是英美一致也；是數年來各國對日本經濟上政治上往還周旋者，自此必非舊觀也。日本之進退機樞固得自爲操持運用者也，及此不應幡然改圖，以保全所剩之餘力，保全國際之地位歟？不應恝然引退，與四萬五千萬之民族，在國際共通而公道之原則之下，言歸於好歟？抑期待國際他種惡化之機會而圖僥倖歟？抑一意孤行，甯與各國相搏，而終於盡毀其餘力，自陷於萬刧不復之絕境歟？吾人未敢遽望日本之能迅合常情常理，然以今日日本之環境，在日本理智之倫，固應取爲收斂鋒芒，改弦易轍之機會，而努力醖釀新政策之轉變；蓋日本究非中國被迫抗戰，不得不戰之比者也。</p>

<h3>紀念中國的摯友　韓寗鎬博士</h3>
<p>— 趨兩</p>
<p>宗敎與敎育是互相爲用，彼此有聯鎖關係，無敎育則理智不能充分的發展，則人之所以異於禽獸者幾希，無宗敎則精神的寳藏，缺乏啟發的可能，生活受本性的操縱，不能踏人超性的門限。韓寧　主敎努力於宗敎和敎育事業者近半世紀以上，所過者化，所存者神，還邇敷敎，影響實深。循循善誘，感格人羣的力量，旣然如此偉大，則本人的造詣高深，可以想象。韓氏的性的精神的生活，誠然是諱莫如深，吾人無由知悉，但是他豐富的生命，呈現於吾人眼前者，總是內生活的點滴和流露，吾人不妨做一個簡的的研究。</p>
<p>韓　鎬傳士生於一八六二年，是德國戚斯特法侖省曼教城（Men,Westphalen人），卒於一九三十九年，時爲山東兗州主敎，享年雖僅七十有七，而消磨於中國的光陰，竟達五十三年之久，其間有三十二年，充任主敎。他精通中國的語文，善操齊魯土語，假使只聞其聲而未見其人，您一定以爲是山東『老鄉』和您對白，絲毫聽不出外國人的氣息來。用國語演說，氣派很大，茶爲動聽，是一位天生的演說家。幷且中文寫得很好，所著的『問答釋義』，業已風行中土，近已印到第十二版。他明瞭中國情形，了解中國文化，體會中國人的心理，深切的覺到中國和中國人的可愛。丸年以前，因公重臨歐土，匆忙急迫中又返中國，人問其故，他說『我願意死在中國人當中」，他深怕死在歐洲，不得身返故國。』</p>
<p>韓寧鎬博士不但是一位宗敎家，幷且也是學者，他早年文藝敎育的根底打得極深，故對於希臘及拉丁文學，均能探本窮源，自入聖言會后，精心硏究神學，遂於一八八五年晋陞神品而爲司鐸，其后復人英慈白魯克及彭勒兩大學，專攻哲學和自然科學，然後方來中國傳敎，於此可以知道他的學養極深，對於現代的知識和思潮，均能把握得住而有極深的認識，所以他的言論及著述，均甚正確而切合時宜，深爲德國人士所歡迎，故明興的德國通儒學院邀爲特級榮譽會員，以獎勵其有功於宗敎及文化。</p>
<p>頻年以來，山東在天災人禍的交迫下，水火刀兵，民不聊生，韓主敎屢盡其所有，竭其所能，以拯救貧苦流離，切實的做到愛人如己的地步。中日戰爭，在時間上超過兩載，在空間上不知有多少人在鋒火征塵中及流亡的錢上度其悲慘無告的生活，我在這裏紀念韓寧鎬博士，因爲他是宗敎家。敎育家。特別是一個完人，同時也要喚起德國正義之士對於中國的同情。（完）</p>

<p>北江西路南起自來水橋北堍、北迄老靶子路至東首一埭店鋪住屋、以及里弄、前日午後三時餘起、已被日方突施封鎖、據記者昨日巡歷新見、日方雖在該路東端、均用木桿及有刺鐵絲攔架、致有不少商店、被圍而無法營業、惟如北江西路天潼路口·七浦路口·交監師路口·海寗路口·等若干交叉處、其東端鐵絲網封鎖處、均開有缺口、聽住居該區域內之商店住戶進出、並聽自動遷徙；尚不需通行證、第若干日後、是項缺口、顯將重事堵塞、爾時住於該區域居民、其欲進入租界中區、須具居住虹口者之同樣手續、以致北江西路上、停駐搬塲車輛頗多、自被封鎖區向租界搬遷者、粉紛不絕、允以靠近鐵馬路小菜塲、位於北江西路東端若干商店、平日營業頗盛、一旦遭受封鎖、其業務上之損失、有難於形容者、至該路各缺口處、均有日兵站崗、情勢相當緊張、</p>
<p>英日兵士　衝突經過</p>
<p>字林報云、昨日（二十九日）午後、西福資高地隊英兵四名、乘卡車一輛、前往北江西路旁衖確在一九三七年戰事時日軍防區內撤除所架之鐵絲網障礙物、而易以新鐵絲網架時、被日本陸戰隊包圍扣留、不得返北江西路、時爲午後三時四十五分、局勢甚形緊張、至晚七時、四英兵及卡車始經釋出、得返自已防區、</p>
<p>英兵被扣後、立即有日陸戰隊士兵而二百五十名、携帶木椿與鐵絲網到塲、日哨兵若干、駐守確在英軍區中之北江西路中央、保護其他日兵移除北江西路東側英軍所置鐵網架、而代以日兵之鐵絲網障礙物、並迫令少數西福資英兵退出所居北江西路東側相近靶子路之防舍、而將該合封斷、此等英兵、則竚立蓬路西側注視之、然昨夜日哨兵</p>
<p>已撤盡時美兵切斷日兵所架陣礙物、而重入彼等之肪舍、當日兵在路東側英軍防區內架高達六呎之障礙物時、居住北江西路以東之數千華人頗爲驚惶、紛紛携箱負篋、而入英軍防區、同時執槍上槍刺之日哨兵駐守英軍防區以內五碼處之北江西路中、雖不阻撓華人出該路以東之虹口區、但至少有一决日哨兵向沿途經過之</p>
<p>華藉老婦摑頰、昨日之事、似確屬英兵不直、因英軍防區至北江西路東側爲止、而東側之人行道、則爲日軍防區之西端、但已往對此點、並不大加注意、北江西路以西十碼處蓬路與武昌路上、昨日仍見英軍前年所建之鐵絲網障礙物、英兵四名、諒認日軍不致反對其在日軍防區</p>
<p>新障礙物內衡中更換故入衖工作、英日軍官與警務處人員於午後六時左右、在日軍防區內之武昌路上、開始磋商、旋聞日兵雖尚未撤除已架之障礙物、退回其防區、然各方認爲此事已解決、而日兵則將於深夜或今（三十日）晨撤除障礙物、回其防區、近數星期來、</p>
<p>盛謠日兵擬在北江西路完全架障碍物、並已在各地點造防舍、而令該區中華人居民登記、然英兵仍能居於路東日軍防區內之防舍中、表示日當局並不反對英兵駐守該地、直至昨日、英兵僅在靶子路與海寗路間架有鐵絲網、俾華人能自由而入西虹口區域、然日兵昨日已將整個北江西路架置障碍物、直至蘇州河爲止、僅</p>
<p>在各路口留小隙、准行人經過、當各軍官進行磋商時、武裝日陸戰隊士兵數卡車停駐於後待令、然入夜日兵架就障碍物、顯無其他行動、今日侵晨、華籍居民繼續粉粉撤退、惟昨日傍晚後、日哨兵已撤退、而至夜間十時、該地附近已絕無日陸戰隊士兵、同時、西福資英兵則分</p>
<p>二處切斷日兵之障碍物、復入靶子路附近之防舍、與北江西路海寗路轉角電話公司房屋之底層、昨日深夜、北江西路以東各街、人跡罕見、而路西則熙　如峰　、日兵之障礙物擴展至天潼路、作業聞郵政總局附近之突兵障礙物、已經</p>
<p>日兵易去並謠傳日兵將通電流於鐵絲網、但昨日深夜並無可證實此項謠諑之象、據日海軍發言人昨夜聲稱、日兵爲劃定防區界限起見、而架障碍物、並準備自八月一日起、調查陸戰隊防區中之一切居民、</p>

<p>位於吳淞口外寳山與高橋兩海塘、自戰事以來、即告失修、去年秋間、雖經同鄉團體設法修堵、無如工程浩大、經費不易籌集、故僅就坍壞之堤岸、加以塡築而已、未免囚陋就簡、雖期鞏固、現沿　塘於本年第一决颶風時、曾遭襲擊、致又傾圯多處、所幸尚未至秋汎旺潮時期、故未生危險、旅滬浦東寳山兩同鄉會爲預防水災起見、將傾坍之堤岸、正在進行鳩工搶修、以免將來秋季發生危險、</p>

<h3>京滬車遭襲擊　橫林附近地雷轟炸鐵軌四濺　機車貨車出軌交通昨已停頓</h3>
<p>大陸報云、沿京滬鐵路一帶作戰之游擊隊、咋（二十九日）晨七時左右、在無錫附近復向該綫襲擊、用機關槍向貨客混合車一列掃射、炸毀路軌數段、機車與貨車八節均出軌、關於傷亡人數、雖未得消息、惟聞搭客死數人、傷若干、日籍鐵路衛兵亦有若干喪折、日軍發言人昨日答覆詢問、承認</p>
<p>有此襲擊事、並稱、自去年二月以來、游擊隊向京滬綫實行成功的襲擊者、此爲第三决、該貨客混合車一列、昨晨七時駛至常州與無錫間、遭游擊隊的四百人襲擊、共地在距一橋樑三百公尺處、該橋雖無恙、惟鐵軌數段被炸毀、機車貨車數節出軌、</p>
<p>該車所載爲農民與貨物、甫駛離常州、即遭游擊隊包圍、發言人答覆另一問話云、除火車衛兵外、車上並無日兵、傷亡詳情不悉云、但聞諸他方面、火車被機關槍掃射、致有死傷、此决襲擊結果之一、昨晨由北站駛出之</p>
<p>京滬快車昨晚已折返、因上海車站未接消息、故駛京快車於昨晨八時照規定時間駛出、比抵出事地點、日兵令司機駕車返滬、據搭該班快車之旅客語記者、車抵該地、仍聞沉重之機關槍與步槍聲、彼等不知肇事之確實性質、亦</p>

<h3>徐家匯　聖母院育嬰工作</h3>
<p>— 陳徵帆</p>
<p>徐家匯聖母院成立於一八六九年，爲天主敎在上海之宏偉樣構，於育嬰工作方面，業建樹不少優異成績，頗値得吾人注意與贊許。帆因考察慈幼事業，曾參觀並硏究該院之育嬰情形，特誌其概略如下：</p>
<p>徐家匯聖母院成立於亡淸同治八年（公曆一八六九年），迄今已有七十年之歷史（註一），其發起人爲天主敎薛孔昭司鐸，賴於首任院長多敏悟姆姆之沉毅多才，與三十年長期之努力（註二），該院務蒸蒸日上，乃得有今日之宏大規模。現在院內芬爲育嬰堂，幼稚園，聾啞學校，啟明女校，聖誕女校，徐匯女中，施醫處，浣衣廠，刺繡所，花邊間，裁縫作等部份，現任院長爲戴步賢會長（拯亡會會長），司育嬰堂事務者，爲奧斯定姆姆。</p>
<p>聖母院一切事務，現由天主敎拯亡會修女（一百五十餘位），與獻堂會貞女（二十餘位）等分別担任，完全以犧牲服務，並不接受絲毫報酬。至於在育嬰堂方面服務者，有姆姆十二名，敎員十四名，保姆職工等三十餘名。</p>
<p>聖母院育嬰堂收容初生至五歲之無靠嬰兒，自成立以來，前後共收容嬰兒二萬五千餘名，目前有嬰兒六百五十名。據謂，在八一三戰事後，每年平均收容三千名，在過去，某日一日間會收容二十二名。在一週間收容八十名，乃慣常而非例外之事。</p>
<p>聖母院育嬰堂有相當完善之醫藥設備，同時，所有姆姆皆具有豐富之醫藥智識，（註三），更有名醫何理中醫師常川義務負責，故能儘量收容患病之嬰兒，與以適當及時之治療。據該堂司事者言，上海其他育嬰堂（如仁濟育嬰堂），亦每將病嬰送往，轉請治療與收容。聖母院育嬰堂爲供給嬰兒以新鮮淸潔之牛奶起見，特自蓄養乳牛二十四頭，每日由專門技師擠乳，並加以消毒之手續，此則不僅爲上海慈幼界之創舉，即在全中國亦屬罕聞也</p>
<p>聖母院育嬰堂之男嬰，至滿一週歲後，即寄養於天主敎人家，由堂方每月予以四元至九元之津貼費。寄養人家，於每月初一日，必須將嬰兒抱至堂中，由司事者加以檢查，如發現有待遇不妥處，即剴切指明，嚴囑其力圖改善。</p>
<p>聖母院育嬰堂之辦理方針，每收進一嬰兒，即對其全部生活（物質的與精神的）肩負完全責任，企圖貫澈努力，將嬰兒栽培成人，予以敎養，授以技藝，並協助選擇配偶，建立虔誠而美滿之家庭。基於此種特有之方針，該堂對於普通育嬰堂所通行之允許領養制度，並無採取與倣行之意。</p>
<p>聖母院育嬰堂之嬰兒，在六歲以上，即受幼稚園敎育，每日學習識字，聽講，遊戲，唱歌等。其每日生活狀况如下：（一）上午六時起身，並晨禱，（二）七時早餐，（三）七時半散步，（四）八時半識字並聽講，（五）九時半吃點心，（六）十時唱歌並遊戲，（七）十一時午餐，（八）十二時午睡，（九）下午三時吃點心，（十）三時半散步並遊戲，（十一）五時半晚餐，（十二）六時晚禱並陲覺。</p>
<p>聖母院育嬰堂之嬰兒，日漸長大，男嬰滿六足歲者，送入土山灣孤兒院，繼續修業。女嬰滿六足歲者，即授以初小課程，並指導學習縫紉（爲必修科），刺繡，花邊，編織，暨其他家庭工作。</p>
<p>聖母院育嬰堂之女嬰，待長至成人時，堂方即協助擇配，建立家庭。依據堂例，入堂者盡奉天主敎，僅可與奉敎男子結婚，而該堂主持者認爲惟有孤兒乃能深切憐愛孤女，故極力協助該堂之成年孤女，與土山灣孤兒院出身之成年孤兒相配婚，藉謀永久而可靠之幸福。孤女於結婚後，如仍願工作者，堂方則負責爲之支配工作，（刺繡，花邊，編織等工作）；吾則，孤女與堂方。永維持密切接觸，感情之挈合，正不啻親母女也。</p>
<p>聖母院育嬰堂因自有房屋，畜養乳牛，職員屬於犧牲服務性質等關係，故每名嬰兒之每月平均費用僅爲八元，此與其他育嬰機關相較，自不可同日語矣。（按仁濟育嬰堂之每孤每月平均費用爲二十一元，上海戰區嬰孩收容所之每孩每月平均費用，爲十九元二角。</p>
<p>聖母院育嬰堂之經費，賴於中外敎民之捐輸，以及該院舉辦各種生產事業之贏餘，其主持者從不向社會舉行勸　，蓋因無此需要也。</p>
<p>（註一）薛孔昭司鐸於亡　淸咸豐五年（一八五五年），即創設聖母院於靑浦之橫塘，同治三年（一八六四年）遷至王家堂，同治八年（一八六九年）復遷徐家匯。徐家匯聖母院辦理之歷程，如運同其前身計，迄今已有八十四年之歷史矣。</p>
<p>（註二）多敏悟姆姆爲法人，在中國共傳敎五十六年，在聖母院之擘劃經營共爲三十年。</p>
<p>（註三）天主敎之姆姆皆具有醫藥與看護智識，不僅傳敎，且醫療人之疾苦也。煤球價格、自外匯緊縮後、廠家因原料上漲、成本昂貴、售價一漲再漲、每噸售價五十二元至五十六元、零售同一貨物、高低亦有三四角、最高價每担三元二三角、最低價爲二元六七角、分量亦不一致、情形紊亂、堪稱已臻極點、茲悉上海市機製煤球同業公會、爲統一市價、特通告於八月一日起煤球零售價目、規定每百市斤國幣三元、不得隨意加减、現在國煤來源絕跡、全賴外煤運滬供給、允以印度煤最旺、雖煤價高漲、但來源仍暢、連日印度煤仍有大量運到、本市存貨充足、存貨俱裕、燃料絕無匱乏之虞、售價可望漸趨穩定、但自外匯一再縮小、洋煤售價隨之上漲、每噸較前提高十餘元後、日方趁機由山東等處運到煤炭、混銷市塲、售價較外煤减低十餘元、銷路甚暢、據傳日方將由華北等處、大量運滬傾銷、攫奪市塲、</p>
<h3>米糧堆棧徹查　嚴懲囤戶操縱　米業今開聯席會議　蕪米開禁早稻出新</h3>
<p>本市豆米行業公會、鑒於上海米價高漲、與平民生計攸關、爲設法調節來源、穩定市價起見、因茲事體大、單獨進行、恐難收效、故特函邀本市米號業公會·碾米業公會·經售米糧公會·常熟米業公所·南帮公所·運米客商聯益會·等七團體、舉行聯席會議、茲錄原函如下、逕啟者、茲敝會定於本月三十一日（星期一）下午四時、假愛多亞路雜糧交易所二樓、邀集本市各米業團體代表、舉行聯席會席、討論重要事項、至希貴（會）（所）推派代表、屆時出席與議爲荷、</p>
<h3>執行限價　徹查囤積</h3>
<p>租界當局除嚴格執行食米限價、竭力疏通國米來源外、並澈查各米糧堆棧存米數量及貨主姓名、業已開始澈查、計有七十七個棧房、屬於法租界者九個、屬於公共租界者六十八個、凡經查明之棧房、由調查者簽字證明、如查出有私自囤積以圖厚利者、決予嚴懲、並限令在限價以下出售、此外並准市民舉發超越限價事件、以憑取締究辦、</p>
<h3>通知應查　米糧堆棧</h3>
<p>通知應查之米糧堆棧如下、中國銀行。浙江興業銀行·交通銀行·上海第一·上海第二·江蘇銀行·金城銀行·新華銀行·中一信託·滋康·地方銀行·中實銀行·東萊銀行·萬盛興·恒豐·隆茂·裕成·生記·永生·泰康·禾豐元·正豐·大豐昌·德大·大有餘·德和潤·公記·潤記·大德新·新裕·生和隆·咸茂·恒達·聯益·大德新南·聚泰和·江南·恒興義·義興豐南·義興豐東·久大·萬昌·新業·平和·萬森盛·章協記·洽大·大同·萬盛泰·協昌德·元茂·同慎·茂泰·安愼二·安愼三·太古·羅斯福·長義恒·鼎泰德·協大·廣和·滬豐·信源·鼎裕·源通·鼎與·黃長盛·鼎和·和記·恒新順·同盛恒·恒興公·鄧仁泰·悅來·大興·萬泰祥、</p>
<h3>東新登塲　蕪湖弛禁</h3>
<p>新聲社記者昨唔市場主任管理委員符前耕據談、浦東新粳業已登塲、往年產額的有三五萬石、樣米業已到滬、品質極優、行將分批裝運來滬、至於嘉興一帶之羊尖、上市在即、但樣米尚未到滬、關於蕪湖之禁米出境、據聞凡持有老搬出證者、仍可裝運出境、新搬出證有於八月一日發給之說、並又苛增「出口稅」每担二角、其次如無錫常熟蘇州杭州平湖等處禁運米糧、亦較前鬆動、當可輾轉運銷來滬、</p>
<h3>華董主張　嚴懲操縱</h3>
<p>關於米糧限價、前經當局邀集米商代表、商定最高米價每石二十一元、並規定於每週中按照市况、用漸决方法减低、每决一元、故本市米價、自兩星期前改低至二十元最高限價後、原擬再設法改至十九元、不料外匯緊縮事件發生、一般投機囤戶、乘機操縱、致米價又復　漲增高、且　暗盤交易、幾達二十三元、幸經當局管制得宜、始告穩定、現悉工部局全體華董委虞洽聊、袁履登。鑒於米價高漲、影響民食至鉅、其所以致此高漲原因、顯係投梭囤戶從中操縱、欲求壓平市價、安定民生、主張非嚴厲懲處投機囤戶及抬價米商不可、如是方能懲一儆百、則米市前途、得期穩定、</p>
<h3>德籍猶太人來華　具體計劃　負責人柏格拉期稱　移民機關經濟協助</h3>

<h3>敎部高敎司科長陳東原談　如何選擇院系及學校　政府限制文科就是加以整理　任何學科祇要學好都有出頭</h3>
<p>（重慶通訊）敎育部高等敎育司科長東陳原氏發表關於靑年升學如何選擇院系及學校、內容頗爲扼要、茲特分誌如次、</p>
<p>原則討論</p>
<p>要想升學的靑年、在投考學校的時候、必須選定學校和院系、而且他們的選採、大都有相當原則、可惜普通所用的原則、未必十分合理、値得加以討論、舉例言之、（一）國家需要的原則、這是很普通的原則、每個升學靑年、都抱負着服務國家的思想、在人材缺乏的今日、這也是很應當的、不過、究竟何種人材是國家所需要、何種人材不是國家的需要呢、這就是非常難說了、大學有八種不同的學院、文·理·法·農·工·商·醫·與師範、沒有一種不是國家的需要、胡適之氏是大家曉得的、他到美國去讀書的時候、立志學農、因爲農是實科、中國現在還是農業國家、農業學好、可以實際救國、誰知他讀了兩年、感覺不是自己性之所近、遂由實科中很重實際的農學、改學文科中最重理論的哲學、當他改科的時候、寫了一首詩、中有「救國於萬事、何事不可爲」之句、果然他回國後、以他哲學上的素養、掀起了五四時期的文化運動、使中國的思想界、有了很大的覺醒、這就足以證明、文學也是可以救圈的、且其影響、甚至比實科還大、國家的需要、萬緒千頭、非常複雜、任何學問技能、都有需要、近十年來、政府有限制文法科的政策、遂有人以爲文法科是不値得學習的了、但細繹政府限制文法科之意、並非不再造就文法科人材、只因文法科之設立、不一定要怎樣設備、一班濫竽充數的大學、遂至隨便開課、又因爲無需實騐、各級所收學生、每比理工科多出一兩倍、故不免粗製濫造、程度降低、所以政府才出而限制、換句話說、實在是加以整理、希望各校留下的文法科、充實起來、能造出眞正的人材、以應國家需要的、抗戰以來、大家都以爲從事建國、工科的需要、一定大增、所以去年統一招生、百分之三三·九的學生、都投考工學院人數佔全考生三分之一强其中允以投考航空工程這系者爲多、這雖足以證明靑年志爲國用的然忱、但是這種覜念、究竟不大正確、倘使所有靑年、都想學習工科、認爲是救國的途經、試問建國大業、除工程外、所有文化事業、社會工作、政治工作、豈不都要停頓、農業商業也都不能改進了麽、果眞那樣又如何建國、故我以爲以國家的需要爲選擇院系的原則、雖然很好、但僅能作一種較高的理想，實際上至少在最近二十年內、國家楚各種人材都需要的、（二）個人出路的原則、這是更普通的原通、每個升學學生、都在考慮着何種學科、學成後出路較廣、去年投考航空工程系的人數最多、也正是這種原因、求學本在於致用、所以這也是很應當的、不過這種原因、也不絕對正確、在各種事業都已上了軌道的國家、求學與出路的關係、誠然比較密切、例是美國、就是這樣、鐵路公路、已經四通八達土木工程茶畢業的學生、簡直不易找到飯碗、其他各科如想學習、也値得注意到社會一各種人材，何者不足、何者過剩、但在中國、一個開始建國的新興國家、百端待舉、需要廣大、已成的人材、旣沒有精確的統計、未來的事業、又沒有詳密的籌劃、簡直無法斷定各種學科需要上的差別、你若追問何種學科出路好、我覺得到不如追問你對於何種學科是不是學的到地、任何學科、只要學的眞好、都有出路、工農商醫果然是職業、文學哲學、也可以當作職業、法律政治與敎育、更不用說、都是職業了、而且對於現社會都有需要、就怕這學的不好、中國老話說的、「行行出狀元」、這句話到現在還有便値、</p>

<h3>美國廢止對日商約與日德成立商約</h3>
<p>— 鮑樂蒂</p>
<p>在東京談判中，美國突然廢止一九一一年成立的美日商業與航運條的。此舉不發生在美國國會中討論此案的今春，而在英日正進行所謂東京談判的現在付諸實行，這已顯出其政治上的重耍性。此訊外傳，東京談判立即陷於停頓。東京談判，雖無美國廢的此舉，結果原也必然失敗的；但停頓在美國恰把美日商的撕去之後，更顯出民治國對於遠東問題的陣綫，絲毫未受英國接受東京談判而有所變化。這都是美國廢止對日商的的政治意義之所在。</p>
<p>然而從經濟觀點上說，美國廢止對日商的的結果，或許較國際外交舞台上給予日木的打擊更耍厲害。</p>
<p>先從兩國貿易關係在各該國的國民經濟之利害上說：不消說：日本對外貿易上的主要目一的，除了取得原料與消納他國內過剩商品於國外市塲之外，現在還有一個更重要的目的，那就是取得外匯來購買軍需資材。日本的對美貿易雖常年入超，但貿易額却佔其所謂「對第三國貿易類」中的首席，維持他出口產業以及軍需產業的主要原料和工具，幾乎全部或大部都仰給於美國，在戰前大量輸入美產的棉花，木材，機械工具之類；現在則大量輸入美產的鋼鐵，機械，石油，銅等等，今日日本絕對必需的軍用原料和器具，百分之九十以上仰給美國的有銅和汽車；百分之六十以上仰給美國的有各種燃燒油；百分之四十二至五十左右仰給於美國的有機器，生鐵。唯其如此，所以日本必需維持在美國的出口市塲，同時以維持其由美購入軍需資材和出口產業必需的原料，對美貿易便在日本「對第三國貿易」中佔絕對的多數。日本對美英法德意五强之貿易額（單位日金百萬圓）</p>
<p>（註）印係本年一至四月累計額</p>
<p>這裏明白指出：日美貿易，非特有如日本侵華戰爭的經濟基礎，同時又如維持他整個國民經濟的條件。所以名記者傑納威氏曾認爲「侵華戰爭是美國的嬰孩」。沒有美國的供給，日本簡直無法侵略中國。而且還有許多專家指出日本工業設備上最大的缺點，在於什九都用的是美國機器。這種高度機械化的生產設備，連一隻螺旋釘都非向原廠配購不可。如果美國一旦停止供給，日木的工業活動，即有淪入全部停頓的可能。</p>
<p>第二點指出的：英美法三大民治國的對日貿易，幾佔着日本對外貿易的全體；所謂他的德意盟弟兄，在日本的戰爭經濟以至國民經濟上，絲毫無法援助，何况他們自己也都仰仗着英美等的供給。所以這决美國突然廢止對日商的，日本朝野便大爲震動。不僅日本如此，連德意朝野也都如此。這就是談判快要兩年的日德商的，所以竟能迅速成立的理由所在。然而從上表所示，日德間的貿易關係，實在渺乎其小，東京和柏林，雖以爲簽訂德日商的是對於美國廢除美日商的的一個答覆，然而也實在太可憐見地了。</p>
<p>日德的商的談判，早在去春於柏林開始了的。常時日本企圖完成一種日「滿」對德的聯合商的，但是因爲德「滿」間的貿易關係，利害上的衝突，遠不如德日貿易上的厲害，所以德「滿」商的還是個別成立，並在去年九月即正式調印，日德商的談判便一直沒有接近。</p>
<p>日「滿」第一次成立貿易協定還是一九三六年四月間的事，這是組成德意日防共軸心的初度演出，在經濟上，僅因日本企圖利用東北的特產輸出來維持他國內對德的購買力罷了。去年計劃簽訂「日滿」一體的對德商的，也就只有這一個作用。因爲日本希望把東北的出超額來抵消他本國對德的貿易入超，自然希望德國對滿」的輸出愈少愈好，這就是德日間貿易利害上根本衝突的理由之一。</p>
<p>再者，德國對「滿」的輸出品，大半是日用工業品和德國國內供給過剩的低級機器之類；日本希望德國輸入的，以軍需資材爲主；這正是德國自給尚嫌不足的產品。當然不願供給他人，這貿易品上的需要不同，也是注定了日德貿易間不易洽調的運命。同時，也就是德「滿」商的所以終於首先成立與個別存在的理由。對這德「滿」商的，吾人亦應有所明瞭。</p>
<p>第一次成立的德「滿」貿易協定的主要內容，是規定德「滿」間每年的貿易額以一萬萬日圓爲度。但德國自「滿」輸入，僅須以四分之三（即七千五百萬日圓）的外匯現貨付給「滿洲」；此外四分之一（即二千五百萬日圓），只須由橫濱正金銀行記入德國的債務名下，而由德國以對日的出超額來軋平。</p>
<p>以東北的輸出力言，這一億日圓的貿易總額，實在只有束縛「滿洲」對德的輸出，並無半點利益可言。但日本爲了政治上的陰謀，便不惜犧牲「滿洲」產業而簽字，「滿洲」的出口商當然反對，日本的進口商也一致反對，因爲限制東北的貿易額，就是限制東北的出超可能，也就是削减日本進口商利用東北出超而得的外滙，去向德購貨的可能。所以去秋成立的新協定，日「滿」一致要求擴大貿易額，德國因內需至亟，對出口限制殊嚴；故勉强允將日「滿」間貿易額擴大爲一億六千三百萬日圓，於是昨年六月以後，「滿洲」便爲了日本需要外匯，大量的增加對德輸出，德國則力謀殺减其對「滿」的入超，也相當的增大其對「滿」（實即日本的變相進口）的輸出。然而日德間的貿易關係，則愈無調整的餘地。因爲德國對「滿洲」所需的輸入品，不過限於大豆，豆油，花生等原料而已，對日本　所需的輸入品是紡織，絲織，水產，玩具之類。這些需要，在德國皆有一定的限度。但日「滿」對德所需的輸入，却都是機器，鐵鍋，化學產品等；這在德國本國，也是極端需要，不能無限地輸出。反之，在德國過剩的攝影機，藥品等，曾要求日本不限制其進口，維持戰前的進口紀錄，但這在外滙恐慌的日本，正視爲不要不急之品，而嚴格限制其進口的，外加日本因對華作戰的結果，國內勞力大缺，一般產業活動皆被軍需工業壓倒：因此非特生產激减，而且有關軍需的出口又是一律限制。職是之故，在日「滿」貿易勉强增加的同時，日德間的貿易則一落千丈，這種根本術突所造成的貿易矛盾，現在非特無絲毫進步，且正益見惡化；試看下表，可知端的（單位日金千圓）</p>
<p>（註）第一年度係自德「滿」第一次貿易協定成立之一九三六年六月至一九三七年五月；第二年度係三七年六月至三八年五月，第三年度係三八年六月至三九年四月。</p>
<p>不特德日兩國間的貿易之根本關係，已如是對立；何况在中國市塲上，德日間的利害衝空，更難於弭平。彼此間的利害旣不易洽調，即使洽調，在日本戰爭經濟以至國民經濟上的關係，還是渺小到不足列舉。所以今次的操切簽成新約，定屬不了了之而已，作用至多略壯聲勢，然在此微小的貿易紀錄上所反映來的聲勢」，只使人更爲之可憐。</p>
<h3>關於我的演講辭</h3>
<p>— 姚慶三</p>
<p>編者言　戰爭國家最可寳貴的力量，是精神一致。上海各界的精神，迄今是吾始終一致？輿論界實負有嚴厲監督的責任。</p>
<p>在最近一星期裏，留在上海的所有Ecouomist羣問，對於上週一出版的經濟評論半月刊所揭發的事件，無不同聲歎息。允其曉得該評論所揭發的，似乎以姚慶三先生爲對象的人，因爲姚先生是國內優秀的經濟藥者之一，所以更令人特別關切。編者也是其中之一，而且又和姚先生是朋友；讀了那詞嚴義正的評論，更覺得難過。</p>
<p>然而在編者讀到姚先生的演講原稿之後，已釋心頭重負，不過大家尚急急希望讀讀姚先生的演講原稿，以明究竟；而姚先生更願公開他的演講原稿，來證明他立塲的光明，以釋羣疑。因爲經濟評論不就出版，承姚先生將該演講稿摘要（因爲原稿長達一萬餘字，本刊地位不能盡量登完）後交本刊發表。想必爲讀者所樂聞。</p>
<p>不過編者個人對於這决事件，有幾點感想：</p>
<p>第一：在學術硏究上最重要的，態度必需純正，立塲且絕對不容分歧。至於學術思想的不一致，這是無可避免的事。像姚先生這裹所談的，就與鄙見頗多出入。孰是孰非？祇有歷史事實的判斷最有力量。</p>
<p>第二：言論固應自山，確又不應諱疾忌醫；但也得在時空間方面加以考量；吾則，不單易滋誤會，且會釀成惡果；不過在書生本色的學者們是往往很難辦到的事。所以與論界的監督，決不是多餘的，而且有其絕對的必耍。但也得力謀防止發生不幸的誤會。如有誤會，便該力謀消除，避免起分化作用。</p>
<p>第三：這决事件，在上海Ecouomist以至智識份子開，是具有破題兒第一遭的「肅正」意味的。且以全國最優秀的學者做對象；關係非常嚴重；性質上與普通的論爭，或許完全不同。但結果却是可喜的：因爲上海的Ecouomist羣的嚴正精神，並未有所損失，反因此而更强調了。</p>
<p>第四：學術論爭，固爲闡發眞理上所必要的過程。但在這非常時期非常環境之下的上海，却尚以力避發生爲妙。鑒於經濟評論的編者說明對於收到的那兩封讀者來函，曾經長期的考慮，並請專家加以硏究；態度之鄭重，由可想見。而姚先生作此演詞提要時，正當讀到那篇評論之後；亦可謂正蒙不白之寃的時期；情緒之惡劣，自在意中，但行文上尚節制其感情，除公佈其演辭之要點外，絲毫不採取論戰方式以辯護其理論。可見雙方都能關懷大局，不作意氣之爭，所以一團疑雲，定可以此文之發表，而即烟消雲散，世問常有「文人相輕」之譏，今已證明其不復存在，此實爲中國學術界空氣上之一大進步，或亦爲非常環境下之非常收獲歟？（張一凡）</p>
<p>鄙人曾於二月之前應東吳大學政治學會及主席的胡文耀校長及讀過演講原稿的孫瑞璜，震旦大學法學院之邀，前往演講，不料時隔二唐文愷，張一凡諸先生作設，原可不必費辭糾月，某報經濟評論攔忽載有似乎涉及上項演講正，惟深恐引起各方誤會，故仍將當時演講結之文稿，該文係以「讀者來函」爲根據，然「讀論，摘要披露，以明眞相，者來函」中所云各節，鄙人絕對不能承認，演　（一）鄙人在東吳震旦二校講演　純屬學術討講內容與「讀者來函」所述相反，至少可由東　論性質，而且立論完全以經濟爲對象，絕對不吳方面約我演講的張素民敎授，震旦方面現任　涉政治，在演講之初，即經鄭重聲明，且鄙人對於政治素無關係，故對政治問題鄙人就根本沒有意見。</p>
<p>（二）人口間題與「滿洲」問題鄙人對於中日兩國人口問題的結論，認爲日本固然有人口過剩之患，而中國之人口過剩，實尤爲嚴重，日本想以「滿洲」爲移民的尾間，但「滿洲」爲中國領土，且亦爲中國的生命，至於「滿洲」綫問題的解決途徑，則根據嚴格的邏輯，以爲不外下列三途，就是（一）中國自然希望收復失土，（二）日本欲淪爲日本的殖民地，（三）類似國際聯盟會李頓調查團所建議的折衷方案，至於究將怎樣解決，則以問題超出經濟領域之外，且事關國策，鄙人豈敢發表任何的主張。</p>
<p>（三）日圓集團問題鄙人對於「日圓集團」素持懷疑態度，詳細意見，可以最近在「財政評論一上所發表的「從英鎊集團談到日圓集團」一文爲證，叉鄙人對該問題在交通暨南大夏各大學亦均曾發表演辭，有各該大學學生之紀錄爲憑。</p>
<p>（四）自由與統制　鄙人對於戰後的經濟建設，鑒於有利用外資的必要，主張應採比較自由的政策，而不贊成絕對的統制政策，原有理論上的根據，至於戰爭時期內，任何國家均應採取嚴格的計畫經濟，自屬事所當然，母庸置論</p>
<p>（五）工業與農業鄙人認爲工業化是中國人口問題的一個解決途徑，只有這樣，中國人民的生活程度，才可希望提高，任何勢力如欲對中國的工業化加以壓迫，必爲中國人民所堅決反對，但因中國的經濟機構目前仍以農業爲主，所以就最近的將來言，中國固應加速工業化的過程，但事實上農業暫時仍將佔着重要的地位，</p>
<p>（六）貿易問題，自由貿易與保護貿易久爲泰西各國經濟學者聚訟紛紜的問題，鄙人主張在戰後中國應採比較自由的貿易政策以利必需品的輸入，而便土產的輪出，再者鄙人所主張的比較自由的貿易政策，係泛指一切友邦而言，而且是需以平等互惠的貿易協定爲基礎的，這樣的意見，原爲個人的思想自由，與政治問題毫無關係，而且除却國社主義的德國及法西斯帝的意大利以外，近年以來，差不多已經成爲歐美各民主國經濟學者—連社會主義經濟學者在內—的一致要求，認爲解決世界經濟問題的重要步驟了。</p>
<p>（七）投資問題利用外資原爲國策之一，中央政治會議曾有三個原則的決定，至於開放內地，則必需以各國放棄治外法權，外人眞能遵守中國法律爲條件，（實際上國民政府於一九二八年與比意丹葡西五國所訂的新約亦曾有同樣的規定），再各國如果能够放棄治外法權，而外人亦眞能遵守中國法律，中國雖可開放內地，但是依據文明各國的成規，覺得以下各種權利，還需加以保留，（一）移民取締權，（二）農地權，（三）交通權，（四）公用權，（五）礦業權，（六）漁業權，（七）軍火製造權，（八）其他特種事業取締權，鄙人以上意見本來完全是以國際條的的慣例爲立論的根據，目前雖非討論時機，但未始不可作學術上的硏究。評論者不察，加以誤解，實爲遺憾。</p>
<p>以上幾點就是我在東吳震旦二校講演的眞相，而我所要披露的亦就是這些眞相而已，至於其他借題發揮的話則事實勝於雄辯，我又何必多說？學術，道德，最可珍貴，意氣之語，均非教所願言也！</p>
<h3>日本經濟之前途</h3>
<p>— 馮美齊女士譯</p>
<p>Japan's　Economic　Outlook　by　T．A．Bisson　FroeignPoliy　Report　Vol．XV，No．7　Jun．15，1939．</p>
<p>最近厦門與上海局勢之發展，足見列强對日本侵略遠東之態度已轉强硬。日軍之侵佔鼓浪嶼租界，英美法三國巡洋艦之海軍即於五月十七至十八日登陸保護。美國且通牒日本，對日人之上海租界行政權之要求致强硬抗議。過去八個月來，日本對歐美利益之打擊繼長增高；自廣州海南島之佔領，以至對租界之攻擊，至此已達頂點。</p>
<p>自歐洲危機日迫，日人之行動倍見重要。雖其重力尚足左右世界二大勢力，惟已大减於二年以前。其行動之範圍已被中國持久戰所限制。第一决世界大戰時日人得在遠東自由行動，奪取歐美之利益。今日則不然，日人所能得者將視其在中國軍政經濟上之成就，及其國內之經濟力爲定。</p>
<p>日人在中國之行動，雖得若干軍事上之勝利，然並非日本之眞正勝利。當一九三七年七月蘆溝橋事變發生以後，不久戰事即蔓延全國，結束之期尚遙遙無日，淪陷區域內之游擊隊頗爲活動。蔣介石領導下之正規軍亦絕未搖動，戰事旣形擴大，日人之欲擊破中國主力亦愈難，而華軍之退至內地，對日人亦愈見不利。</p>
<p>在軍事未澈底解決以前，日人在中國之政治經濟僅能得局部之成就。其所迭成之傀儡政府即日人亦不願正式承認之，經濟之開發，必待政治穩定以後始得順利進行。現日人尚未獲勝，如第二决大戰發生，必因中國戰事之延長而大受妨礙。</p>
<p>戰事對日本經濟財政上之影響，頗難估計。一九三七年夏日本國會通過軍費預算時，以爲在上海南京淪陷後，戰事即能終止而作和平談判。結果未見實現。其後日本國會復通過空前鉅大之軍事預算一項。軍需進口之鉅大，使日本商業及滙兌上亦遭受嚴重之壓迫。如大戰發生，而日本又與西方民主國家相對立，其進出口市塲勢皆斷絕，結果必加重國內之經濟危險無疑。</p>
<p>日本國內經濟</p>
<p>在戰時需要之壓迫下，日本國內經濟上發生若干種錯綜複雜之問題：膨脹之預算使賦稅增高，內債亦有空前之增加，紙幣之增發更影響通貨穩固，物價亦上升不淺。日本之能吾免除通貨膨脹之威脅，全視其能吾提高農工生產以應付巨大之戰時財政需要爲定。</p>
<p>表（一）明示戰事發生以來，日木財政負擔之增加情形。一九三一至一九三三年之預算基於Miseits政府之「免除膨脹」政策。其經費大半得自稅收及他種收入，借款佔殺小數。其後五年之預算由藏相Takahashi所擬定。借款數已較增加，惟從未超過七五三百萬日元，此五年中商業頗見繁榮，政府經費之增加使游惰勞工及資本皆得充分利用。通常稅收持續增加，一九三五至三六年復實施營業贏利稅，是年得二六百萬，翌年得四二百萬。其時國債由六，一八八百萬增至一〇，五七五百萬，凡增加四，三八七百萬，或百分之七〇。</p>
<p>表（二）之最後三年預算與Takahashi時代之日本財政成尖銳化之對照。一九三七至一九三八年之數字包括半年之戰事經費。其後二年包括全年戰事預算。一九三九至一九四〇年之經費幾叫倍於戰事發生以前。一九三八至一九三九與一九三九至一九四〇年之借款幾叫倍於一九三六至一九三七年。賦稅之增加亦同等顯著。賦稅收入每三年約增加半兆，一九三九年到四〇年之估計爲一，五三二百萬日元，較戰前一年增加百分之一五〇。該年除增加賦稅以外，公債尚需發行五，六五二百萬日元，始能補足預算之虧短。</p>
<p>如何使此鉅額公債發行不影響其經濟動作，爲日本戰時財政上之重要問題。實際售出之公債常低於預算之估計。一九三七至三八會計年所發公債共二，二三〇百萬日元。一九三八至三九會計年所發公債，至一九三九年二月共售出四，三〇〇百萬日元。戰事發生初十八個月內預算當發行公債八，叫九四百萬日元，而實際售出僅六，五四〇百萬日元。</p>
<p>銷售公債之困難可於日本銀行所握數額之增加見之。過去三年間其所握數字見表（二）。第二項爲銀行所承受而未消化之公債數。東方經濟學報言：「一九三八年發行公債爲四，三五〇百萬日元，而日本銀行所提者增加五叫〇百萬日元以上。即未消化者佔百分之一五·七，其情勢似未可樂觀。」除國家借款以外，一九三八年私人團體所需借款的四，〇〇〇百萬日元。雖一九三八年國民儲蓄達八，〇〇〇百萬日元，而終不能完全消受政府之公債。且生產量增加極微，則國民儲蓄之增加或由於貨幣價値之跌落，前時之積儲自亦其一部份也（未完）</p>

<p>建菇於六七兩月之間、以香港帮不斷搜辦套滙、致市價節節上漲、查其間最低僅二百二十元、逐升至四百元、迄至最近竟開過四百六十元、如斯飛黃騰達、可謂空前創見、</p>
<h3>廣幫動辦海蜇</h3>
<p>海蜇旣以夏令銷路甚活、近日廣帮又復動辦、於是售盤堅挺、刻市蜇皮爲二十元、蜇頭十七元、較之前市、漲起四五元之譜、其勢穩定、</p>
<h3>黑白椒堅挺</h3>
<p>黑白椒自外匯暴縮後、未有到貨、乃近日交易尚不寞寂、蓋以現市滙率劃之成本、將來已難抵進、故一股人買意甚濃、近市黑大椒已開六十七元、比升二元、汶島白椒一百二十元、續升十五元、俱爲現鈔、</p>
<h3>變相的外幣</h3>
<p>— 慕翁</p>
<p>昨日木報本埠新聞載：有人建議發行一種新滬幣，以英金爲基礎，價値爲八辨士，聞洋商頗多贊同云云。查上海爲我國唯一通商口岸，自開埠以來，中外交易，均以我國通貨爲本位。雖洋商銀行嘗利用淸末民初之「崇洋」心理，發行鈔票，但自中國等銀行發行鈔票以還，經過民三袁世凱私心自用，停止中交鈔票兌現，時上海中國銀行行長宋漢章氏不受亂命，照常兌現，頓使中國銀行鈔票之信用，以迄於今，同一鈔票，似乎中國銀行鈔票爲可貴，足見此舉功效偉大，印象深刻也。及國民革命軍到達上海以後，民族經濟之意識轉强，洋銀行鈔票使用之範圍愈狹，而終歸於消滅。至推行法幣之後，發鈔集中，各業稱便，流通更利。現外商常因外滙暗市猛縮，只顧自己目前之利益，不顧上海占絕對大多數中國人士之困難，一再增價，即如公用事業，旣已享有獨占之待遇，煤價雖漲，並非突增，而漲價頻頻，貨幣觀念，利己主義太强遂不顧公衆之負担，並此不饜其所欲，又欲利用中國少數進口業及少數殷富資金逃避之心理，惟恐法幣續跌，惟恐物價不漲，惟恐其生意保障不個，而只可在上海一市行使其性質等於外幣之建議，若果採納此說，竟至實行則破壞我國幣制，勢必使法幣在滬流通大受阻礙，並發生法幣與新貨幣之投機賣買。使已統一之幣制變成不統一，亦破壞英國當局維持法幣之諾言。上海旣爲我國地方，法幣爲世界公認之我國通貨，在我國境內，應用我國貨幣，不應另發新貨幣，中外商人固欲謀貿易發展，常合作穩定外滙，鞏固法幣基礎，而弗助紂爲虐，有間接摧殘法幣之舉動是利之久遠者也</p>

<h3>中外砲製</h3>
<p>中國古用石砲，今用火砲。石砲之制，始於軒轅，而范蠡用蜚石之法，李密用廣雲砲之攻，以及延壽以手投石，郝昭以繩運石，諸葛亮以衝車破陣，皆後世用石砲之最著者也。至火砲之制，始於元世祖得西域火砲，用以攻蔡州城，有明更廣求其制，遂爲一代火砲之祖。永樂中得神機砲，特置於神機營內，而大將軍砲用車，翼虎砲及百子砲用架。正統十四年御善請鑄兩頭銅砲，各藏彈子十枚。景泰年間師翔製銑有機，頃刻三發，能及三百步外。天順三年參將房庸言破敵用火器，名九龍筒，一燒而九箭齊發。至嘉靖八年右都御史汪鋐稱佛郞機之利，正德末廣園得其制，以銅爲之，長五六尺，大者重千斤，小者重百五十斤，巨腹長頸，腹有脩孔，以子銃五枚，載藥置其腹發之，又利於水戰，駕以蜈蚣船，所向無不靡者。白沙巡檢何需得其法，遂令造之，發於各邊疆，謂之將軍砲。萬歷十九年故都督黃應用謂大將軍砲，重數百斤，但用之甚難，後人倣而製之，　空其中，用麻索貫以藥彈，輕而可舉，費亦省。後大西洋番船至，復得巨銃曰紅夷，長可二丈餘，重至三千斤，發之洞裂石城，震驚數十里。按鐵砲之用，就中國言之，古不如今，以西國較之，則中國不及西國之精。今觀普國之砲，月見而月異，日出而日新，究其故，蓋舍舊謀新，無日不在研究也。我國人昔知法國砲之精，今悉普國砲之更精也。</p>

<h3>到張店</h3>
<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>——戰地追記</p>
<p>大別山在武漢外圍戰發動　之前，似乎海很生疎，正如大洪，太行，中條山一樣，沒有引起人們普遍的生意；而且它從來未曾獲得什麽詩人的揄揚，所以祇好讓匡廬等山去出足風頭。然而這位無名英雄，却凖備着吞噬一切的姿態，複雜的路徑，重疊的岡巒，以及深遂的山谷，都會使人家頭痛起來，而發出「行不得也」的浩歎；要不然，武漢已經淪陷了九個多月，何以至今沒有損壞它一草一木，這不是很明顯的證據？</p>
<p>它的全貌，是這樣的：從桐柏山起，蜿蜒東南，經豫鄂兩省而入安徽，一直跟皖山脈接聯，成爲長江與淮河的分水嶺。東部伸人安徽英山縣境，再由霍山折向東北，盤結於潛山，主峯高六千五百尺，各爲天柱山。北支從合肥東出，到張八嶺爲止。如果說得象徵些，它彷彿是蹂伏着的一位勇士，兩條像鋼鍊一樣的臂膊分入豫鄂，而一副生鐵鑄成的驅幹便屼立皖西。並不是我們有意誇張，在從前「圍剿」」時期，曾經分三路進兵，從商城經蘇仙石挺進的一路，便被遏於狗脊嶺，其餘兩路，一阻於松子關，一挫於楊柳店，都不能越過雷池一步，那麽以今例昔，即使走得進去，也是休想出來。</p>
<p>那天，我們到了皂靴河，遠遠的望去，狗春嶺在雲層中出現了，便趕着早凉，一口氣跑到了張店。</p>
<p>卜卜卜……，</p>
<p>步槍的聲音，突然從山坳裹響起來，因爲在環繞着的深山中，聲音就覺得特別響，而且繼續不斷地開放着。</p>
<p>「幹麼？」小沈驚奇了。</p>
<p>「也許他們打進了大別山！」老姚嘲笑地說。</p>
<p>接着，就是一陣哄笑。當我們越過山岡，出現在松樹林子對面的兩隊鬥士，正在演習野戰，一塊石頭，一株大樹，以及一堆泥土，都是進行突擊時掩護物，他們臥倒在草地上，擺出瞄凖的姿勢，同時矯掩地探視着，活動着，追逐着。的摸經過了半個鐘頭，才始收隊。看了他們的袖章番號，知是屬於馮治安將軍的部隊，由於彼此的歌詠介紹，我們跟隊長開始談話，從北平淪陷起，一直到調皖西防爲止。</p>
<h3>文藝的建設</h3>
<p>— 楊彥岐</p>
<p>不必下什麽定義立什麽解說，文藝不是技術，該是懂得文藝者所共曉的吧、既　技術，就應該無所謂建設，亦無所謂破壞了。但是，文藝卻自有其建設性，亦有其破壞的能力。因為誰都不能否認：文藝，在人手裏，可以作為工具，亦可以作為武器。而實際上天下一切所謂「工具」者，也正是「武器」的另一種說法。</p>
<p>譬如戰時的文藝，不問是否直接的反映或暴漏。至少應該在建設的黃石上能夠站得住、戰爭固然是物質上的戰爭，可是在心理上卻是積極的建設。戰場上一片灰燼，儘管死傷精兵逾萬，而在我們心裏，卻留下一個深刻的鬥爭的觀念。戰爭愈久，物質損失愈大，而作戰的決心愈鑒定。這不是建設嗎？這種建設在促進中，是要求助於文藝的。</p>
<p>反過來看，有建設則必破壞。要建設十幾層的大樓，先得把原來地上的泥土剷平，還要深深打入基層。要在文藝上建設新的紀元，亦先得革除舊的殘渣。這原是有理由的話，誰也不能吾認。然而，事實上往往有人會忘記新的產物是需要舊的肥料來培養。，新的建設是需要舊的園地來供奉。同時，我們也不能削足適履的割除一切不是自己的建設。我們的建設在我們建設中，而他人的建設亦應該滋長。好花園裏止只種一種花，允其是文藝園地裏，只要不是害蟲，並沒有不能容納的道理。</p>
<p>談到文藝當然會涉及思想。　到思想，也許不是切合建設的目標。建設自然不落伍，不退後，而也不一定大聲呼喚，惟求十里百里之外皆聞其聲。建設是在產生新的形式，而不是在互投陳套。在建設中，固無排斥他人之理，而亦不必與別具用心者引人同途。文藝有思想，思想自有其主覜。有時主觀的尖端是一把利刃；這把利刃應該用在對立陣地的敵人，不是用來壓制同在生產，同在建設的弟兄。不問是個人，抑且集團，只要「個人得不忘記自己崗位，或「集團」得不自私，都是建設。萬一巴不得要爲人之首，想壓服別人的成功，阻止別人的行進，那末非但自己不是在建設，甚至是積極的破壞了。</p>
<p>在文藝的領域中也是如此。</p>
<p>要開築荒蕪的園地，要建設莊嚴的王宮，或者要產生一部份偉大的作品，都有一個共同的目標：就是貨眞價實。空喊不成，空手搖旗也不成。喉嚨喊破，鼓面擊穿，建設的成績又何在呢？理想歟？幻夢歟？魯迅先生會經在遺囑裏告誠其子，說空頭的文學家不要做。何者是空頭文學家呢？不事建設的文藝作家罷了。</p>
<p>建設是建設。天下沒有永遠成功的紙面老虎。我們應該把文藝帶到戰爭的山原，來繪　時代的面具；但是不能把戰爭的形式帶進文藝的領域，來作爭奪陷害的爭鬥。文藝領域中需要的是建設，不是把建設來加以毀壞。敞人在面前，正亟待建設起新的戰器和新的糧物。</p>
<p>超然，與人無爭，淡然越世，種種態度是我們不需要的；而破壞後方，搬弄口舌的文藝更是我們今日的大敵。</p>
<p>國家在積極的行進中，且等着文藝園地裏的建設發揚光大吧。</p>
<p>山多宜久戰　地闊耐長征　勝利誰能得　終同白日明</p>

<h3>散文詩二首</h3>
<p>— 舛艮</p>
<p>幻影</p>
<p>森林中描繪出一個影子，像雲？像薄暝？像一泓止水？像朦朧的暮靄？像春天的太陽？……然而牠什麼都不像，牠是世界上最殘酷的荒凉。</p>
<p>我伸手去摸探，不料，我雙手埋入了憂鬱的，虛無的黑暗，恍惚間，我消逝了一生的夢幻。</p>
<p>山林中，仍然是一片迷濛。</p>
<p>風，颺遍了塵土，吹斷了麥莖，吹枯了小草，吹動了春水，吹盡了陰凛的荒塚，然而吹不透幻影一般的人生。</p>
<p>寂寞的樹影，你問我：『是什麼時候了？』</p>
<p>『……』我抬頭向你看看。</p>
<p>我想說：『總之是晴天。』</p>
<p>然而我却這樣說了：『現實的太陽已經不發光了。』</p>
<p>『那麼，盡是黑暗的嗎？』你又問我。；』我告訴你：『人生的幻影原是埋葬在黑暗裏的啊古怪的音樂</p>
<p>靜夜中，我戴着星斗，踏着露痕，尋找一些遺失了的聲音。</p>
<p>可是荒漠的大地上什麽也沒有。</p>
<p>於是我裹着失望的靈魂，悠悠然越過小橋。</p>
<p>遠處却飄來一陣音樂：</p>
<p>夜雖然長，</p>
<p>却不能埋掉我們的白日，</p>
<p>南風帶給我們</p>
<p>黎明的消息：</p>
<p>孤僻的路人喲，</p>
<p>莫再在失望裏徘徊了！</p>
<p>哦，我尋着了，這親切的聲音，這縈廻於心壁之上的古怪的音樂呵。</p>
<p>雲上已微微昇起曙色，我向前走着，踏着興奮的勝利的步武，而緊跟着我足後的就是黎明。</p>
<h3>簷溜</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>熱情</p>
<p>年靑的人誰不充溢着過多的熱情呢？倘缺少了它，那是病態。</p>
<p>熱情如同一篝野火，熊熊地燃熾，蒼茫中照澈道路；在這寒冷的世界上輸給人們以生命的熱力，生活的勇氣。</p>
<p>對於熱情也該愛惜，好好地使用，不能白白地浪費。要把它反洩在神聖的事業上。仗了年靑多幹點年靑人該幹的事吧，自由畢竟是更可貴的。</p>
<p>「南苑的犧牲實在太大了！」我說。</p>
<p>「可不是，允其是剛在訓練的學生們，」他惋惜地說，「他們沸騰着的熱血，都沒有索取到相當的代價！」</p>
<p>「那麽你怎樣脫險的呢？」小沈止不住揷問了一句。</p>
<p>「不，不，」隊長答道，「我是防守永定門的，跟着大隊撤退到南口。」</p>
<p>在他們繼續演習的軍笛聲中，我們便離開了張店。</p>
<h3>送君蕃</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>水連天，天連水，一片遼闊的在洋。一艘輪船像把鋒利的刀子切出一綫水路，海，痛苦地吐着白沫子，沿着傷口。粗大的烟突得意洋洋地噴出縷縷的煤烟，衝着藍藍的天（瑪德里般的天空）。</p>
<p>坐在餞行的席匕，我有遼遠的想像。我面前有裊娜的烟圈。</p>
<p>「密歇根州密歇根湖傍密歇根大學。」他說着這惹人發笑的地址。於是，有人記下來了，「是湖，不是河，湖畔詩人的湖。」他改正說，「要寫英文的。」</p>
<p>「湖畔詩人」，我抓住了這四個字。咱們的朋友也是位詩人呢。但，我不知道他是不是歡喜華茨華斯。聽說他的詩都是對於生命的禮讚，可惜我讀過的很少，而我的印象是織巧和精緻。我的意見是該寫得粗魯些，質樸些。藝術的良心應當而且必需是正直的，對於時</p>
<p>活題就如同湖水乏監以的，任意流開去，東一句，西一句，一個哈哈接着一聲笑。我沉默，沉默得古怪。「你怎麽不言語？」我微笑，望着裊娜的烟圈。</p>
<p>「四年後你還會愛好文藝嗎？——現在你所熱愛的」</p>
<p>「我想會的。但也許我將多多地寫做散文。」</p>
<p>「好是好的，怕是很難吧？」我知道他是去讀實業管理</p>
<p>「你還會記住我們嗎？祖國呢？」</p>
<p>「自然會的，更會記住祖國。在那邊，我將做我所能做的事。」</p>
<p>我們都笑了，年靑人的笑，明朗地。</p>
<p>於是，我們說着自己的年齡和生日，我是三哥，他是四弟。我們有哥哥，有弟弟，還有一個六妹。握着手，緊緊地。我們又大聲的笑了。椅子也格格地笑了。</p>

<h3>敬告讀者</h3>
<p>本年勞工節，本會應中報當局之的，主編「法律」，創刊之初，適爲本會創立十周紀念之前夕，回溯十年以還，本會對於法律僅限於同仁之間，商兌切磋，雖間或以研究所得，獻替於立法當局，而未能普遍服務於社會大衆，申報旣以輯務見委，深喜有以自効，故毅然應命，且以會員十數人，專司其事，所以示不苟也。</p>
<p>「法律」發刊之際，曾揭　數事，曰扶植法律正義，日間揚法治精神，並隨時蒐集足供硏究之材料，液輸民衆法律之常識，迄今方三閱月，同人黽勉從事，讀者熱誠贊助，無不以此爲其共同之目標，悉力以赴，期達最後之標的。庸知事態之演變，有未能逆料者：現今經濟情形，瞬息萬變，動盪靡定，此次金融風潮，雖造因於牟利者之投機，而結果所及，物價高漲，紙價之昂，倍於曩昔，申報當局，處此艱難之會，猶一本以往之精神，爲民喉舌，第周刊旣多，耗費自巨，旣無國貨供應，乃不得不謀挽回漏巵之道，乃將各種周刊，暫行停頓，此誕生甫三月之「法律」，亦隨與讀者諸君暫別矣，在申報有難乎爲繼之苦况，在本會有迫不獲已之衷懷，吾知讀者諸君，亦當具有同感也。</p>
<p>抑允有言者，「法律誕生，雖閱時至暫，然我人耕耘灌溉，未嘗稍懈，硏究言論諸作，無不把握時代中心，發爲至誠之言論；即判解公牘各欄，亦嘗盡力廣事蒐求，期爲實用之助；至如質疑之解答，準據法令，酌情度理，不厭求詳，均爲讀者諸君所共鑒。雖於今日遽與諸君告別，爲時未免過促，然正以其爲時短促，反堪回味。申報當局，自不願此種現象之永存，本會同人，亦亟欲再有機會以獻曝，是讀者諸君，不妨稍减其依依惜別之情緒，重見之日，想不在遠也。</p>
<p>今當暫別，爰進一言，願讀者諸君，鑒而諒之！</p>
<p>研究與批評</p>
<h3>公司董事競業禁止之研討</h3>
<p>— 周鯤</p>
<p>我民法公司法規定商號之經理人以及無限公司之無限責任股東，如不得商號之允許，（民法第五六二條）或無限公司其他股東之全體同意，（公司法弟六條第一項）均不得爲自已或他人經營公司同類之事業，亦不得爲同類公司之無限責任股東，吾則，商號（民法第五六三條）或無限公司其他過半數之股東，（公司法第二八條第二項）得爲其爲自己或他人所爲之行爲，視爲公司所爲，法條規定甚明，毫無疑義，惟股份有限公司之董事，是吾亦受競業禁止之拘束，則頗有硏討之價値。</p>
<p>夫投份有限公司之董事者，乃代表公司以及執行業務之股東也，故不論其爲特定對外代表公司之董事，抑爲對內執行業務之董事，均屬權限廣大，職責綦重，深悉公司一切業務內幕，設利用之爲自己或他人爲同類之營業，而與公司競爭，或爲他公司之無限責任股東，則公司必受重大之影響，而全體股束將蒙受不利，故爲防止利害衝突及克盡職責起見，均應受競業禁止之拘束。</p>
<p>在我國舊公司條例第一五八條，定爲董事得各自代表公司，而競業禁止之規定，置於該條第二項，故凡係董事，皆應適用，自無問題，惟查我國公司法第一四五條第一項規定，「公司得依章程或股東會之决議，特定董事中之一人或數人代表公司」，而第二項規定，「第二十八條第三十一條至三十三條之規定於董事準用之，」以競業禁止之法文，置於特定代表公司董事之後，則一似特定代表公司之董事，始應準用競業禁止之規定，其他執行業務之董事，即可不受拘束，竊以爲若作如此解釋，則衡之法理人情，均朱免失當，蓋執行業務之董事，乃公司對內之最高行政機關，即經理人之任免，亦有權决定，（公司法第一四四條）如可不受限制，則設或營私舞弊，爲所欲爲，則流弊所驅，貽害無窮，不僅失保障其他各股東之道，亦非商業社會之福，且與公司法第二十八條，不論是吾執行業務之股東，皆一律受競業禁止規定之嚴格立法意旨，顯相違背，况經理人爲董事所選任，尚須受競業禁止之拘束，而權力高於經理人之執行業務董事，反可不受限制，事理上亦殊屬矛盾，恐立法常時對於法條結構之技術，容有疏忽，杜絕爭執，唯有待於司法院之解釋矣</p>
<p>董事之應受競業禁止之拘東，已如上述，至董事如何始得爲同類營業，以及違反競業禁止時，如何行使制裁，在法律上亦有說明之必要，特分言之如下：</p>
<p>（甲）董事如何始得爲同類營業，我國公司法第二十八條第一項規定，「股東非經其他股東全體之同意，不得爲自己或他人爲與公司同類營業之行爲及爲他公司之無限責任股東，然該條文所規定者，係指無限公司股東而言，故曰「其他股東全體之同意」，若股份有限公司與無限公司，組織旣不相同，援用時常然不能一致，蓋股份有限公司，如非發起設立，其股東人數，必甚衆多，如必須經「其他股東全體合意」，事實上殊不可能，故股份有限公司董事，如欲爲同類營業，「非經其他股東全體同意」一語，筆者以爲當解釋爲「非經股東會之决議」即應有股東過半數代表股份總數過半數者之出席，以出席表决權之過半數之决議，方爲合法有效，（公司法第一〇〇條第二項第一二八條第二項）</p>
<p>（乙）違反競業禁止時，如何行使制裁，我國公司法第二十八條第二項規定，「股東違反前項規定時，其他股東得以過半數之决議，將其爲自己或他人所爲之行爲，認爲公司所有，但自行爲後逾一年者，不在此限」，按「其他股東過半數之决議」一語，亦係指制裁無限公司股東而言，筆者以爲制裁股份有限公司董事時，除股東會之决議爲當然有效外，尚可援用公司法其他之規定，即一，監察人，（公司法第一六〇條）二，股份總數十分之一以上之股東，（公司法第一五○條）皆可直接行使，以免召集股東會及必經股東會之决議種種手續，藉收運用敏捷之效力，惟是吾有當，尚希海內碩學，有以敎之。所有權之研究</p>
<h3>所有權之研究</h3>
<p>— 鄭保華</p>
<p>讀五月一日本刊之發刊辭，謂硏究法律之方法有四：一，哲學的方法，一，分析的方法，三，歷史的方法，四，社會學的方法，四者之中，凡以哲學，分析，及歷史等方法硏究法律，均有缺點可言，欲求完美眞確者，捨適用社會學方法外，其道無由，言頗警闢，實足爲一般硏究法律而對方法未知取捨者之指路明燈，蓋以社會學之眼光，而觀察法律種種現象或探求其結果，其所得者自與憑哲學，分析，歷史等方法而獲得者不同，且因共由社會學方法而獲得，必能與實際社會溶成一片，無閉戶造車，削足適廢之誚，茲即本上述意見，而論所有權理論之基礎</p>
<p>最初之所有權，究因何而成立？所有權原則上不受任何人侵犯，其理由爲何？對此，因歷來學者對法律硏究方法之不同，故其主張亦各殊，有主張先占說者，有主張勞動說者，有主張法定說者，有主張需要說者，有主張經濟說者，有主張人性說者，最後尚有主張進化說者，聚訟紛紜，莫衷一是，如憫人對研究方法，非先有一確定之見解，定將目眩神迷，有莫知適從之苦，今將其各種學說之大要列舉如左：</p>
<p>先占說謂最先本物各無主，凡最初以意力體力加於無主物之上而占有之者，即取得物之所有權，且得排除他人之干涉，此認先占爲原始取得動產或不動產所有權之論據也。</p>
<p>勞動說認原始取得物之所有權，全藉人類之勞動，此則以所有權全由生產而得，如無主荒地因開墾而取得土地所有權，礦物因開採而取得礦物所有權，及其他以勞力變化原料作成新生產之物者均屬之。</p>
<p>法定說認所有權之能原始取得及其不可侵犯性，均屬法律所賦予，倘法律對所有權不加保護，則所有權即有難以繼續存在之虞。</p>
<p>需要說以爲所有權根本發生之原因，乃因人民有種種欲望需要滿足，此種欲望之欲求滿足，必藉物之所有權方式以塡補之，此即所有權之作用也</p>
<p>經濟說認所有權因有益於社會經濟，始有其地位，而得以存在，最初所有權發生之原因，亦不外因其有益於社會經濟之一點也。此說與上述需要說均爲屬於經濟學方面之主張。</p>
<p>人性說認所有權乃出於人類之天性，蓋人類非資外物爲養，則不能保其生命而圖肉體及精神之發達，故所有權之存在之最初事實，乃全出於人性，認物體不應以力爭而得，人與人間，應對任何人勤勞而得之物，互尊其所有權，實爲人類生存發達之必要條件，此人性說所認爲所有權之起源也。</p>
<p>至於主張進化說者，則認所有權乃因事實上適應社會生活狀况變遷進化而存在。</p>
<p>各種學說之大旨旣明，吾人今即秉最新社會學之見地以批評上述學說之得失，惟本文之作，其目的全在證明適用社會學的方法較其他方法爲優，至於吾人批評學說之是否得當，上述數學說中究以何種最爲妥適，此固仍不能謂毫無見仁見智之餘地也。如以社會學眼光而論，先占之意見，實欠明晰，究限於體力所及之範圍乎？抑以心力所及之任何範圍乎？又先占不過爲一種事實，不足說明所有權之起源，如製木爲舟，鑄　爲輪，溶銅成鉢，釀葡萄爲酒，而獲得舟，輪，鉢，酒所有權，實勞力之結果，而非藉先占也，况依現行民法第八一四條規定：「加工於他人之動產者，其加工物之所有權屬於材料所有人，但因加工所增之價値，顯逾材料之價値者，其加工物之所有權屬於加工人」，則加工人依本條而取得所有權時，更與先占無關，反之若以勞動爲所有權取得唯一之泉源，亦有非是，蓋世間儘多不勞而獲，或以些微之勞力而得鉅大之所有者，因加工於他人之物除上述民法第八一四條情形外，多不能取得所有權，况土地根本非人勞力所造成，不過徒藉地面　上之開墾而耕種，然對土地所有權之本身，固非全與勞動有關者也，至於法定說則忽視所有權實先法律而存在，因其有正當不可侵犯之理由，法律方從而保護之，如以所有權爲法律所造成，未免拘泥法律形式，忽略法律精神，捨本而逐末也。如依需要說，則人類慾望，多難滿足，貪婪之徒，將藉此爲護符，紛爭攘奪以起，秩序尚何能保，且忽視勞力對所有權構成之職能，故亦有未妥，經濟說認社會經濟因所有權存在而發達，亦似是而非之論，蓋個人所有權之存在，亦頗有妨社會經濟之處也，如大地主使佃戶耕其田而已收其利，即其一例，進化論以進化而說明所有權之本源，而忽視普遍不易之人性原則，蓋所有權隨時代而變化，固爲事實，然此不過爲一種變遷，仍非所有權創始之原因，然則所有權究因何而發生，其木源究何在？苟以社會學硏究法而推論之，似以人性說爲最適當，蓋所有權木隨團體生活之必要，或利益而變遷，而團體生活原有人類本性，則所有權自亦出於人類本性，亞里士多德曰：「人爲社會生活之動物」，霍布士曰：「人人相鬥，乃人之本性」，可知人類本有親愛之心，又有憎惡之情，尊重他人所有權，此親愛之心使之也；排斥他人對本人所有權之干涉，此憎惡之情使之也，苟無上述自然之人性，所有權即難發生也。吾人旣本人性而定所有權之起源，則更就社會學而硏究之，雖知所有權爲各人生存發達之必要條件，而各人須有取得所有權之自由，但行使此自由時，須限於不侵害他人所有權之範圍，且以正當之手段出之，此即各國進步民法，對所有權之行使，均類有限制是也。權利久不行使，如任令土地荒蕪，不加墾植，固認爲反社會之行爲，由法律加以干涉，强制行使，至於濫用權利，各國法律，更多明文加以限制，財產處分，亦因社會關係，在某種塲合，不能任令有所有權者之自由，如雖爲夫完全所有之產業，但當其所有權轉讓他人時，必須有其妻之同意及加入等，我國現行民法對所有權行使之限制，亦有明文規定，如民法物權第七六五條規定、「所有人於法令限制之範圍內，得自由使用處分其所有物，並排除他人之千涉」，及第七七三條規定「土地所有權，除法令有限制外，於其行使有利益之範圍內及於土地之上下，如他人之干涉，無碍其所有樣之行使者，不得排除之」，又第七九三條規定，「土地所有人於他人之土地有煤氣，蒸氣，臭氣，烟氣，熱氣，灰層，喧囂，攝動，及其他與此相類者侵入時，得禁止之，但其侵入輕微，或認土地形狀地方習慣認爲相當者，不在此限」，及第七九〇條規定「土地所有人得禁止他人侵入其地內，但有左列情形之一者，不在此限：一，他人有通行權者，二，依地方習慣，任他人入其未設圍障之田地牧塲山林刈取雜草，採取枯枝，枯幹，或採集野生物，或放牧牲畜者」，叉第七九一條第一項規定「土地所有人遇他人之物品或動物，偶至其地者，應許孩物品或動物之占有人或所有人入其內尋查取回」等，均爲屬於所有權限制之規定也，凡此規定之立法理由，亦不外認法律乃以社會爲本位，認今之社會實多數人之融合體，即人人相與，有密切互助不可分離之關係，各個人間旣互相連繫，因之遂有社會連帶主義之產生，上述所有權之種種限制，亦所以本社會連帶主義而認公共利益爲重，而以個人利益爲輕也，故吾人如能以社會學之方法而硏究現代所有權之法律，則其貫通也自易，吾則如適用其他哲學，分析，歷史等方法，即仍難免有扞格之虞也，木文之作，乃藉所有權一點以證明硏究法律之方法實以社會學的方法最爲可靠，推而廣之，則處法律處處帶有社會化之現代，硏究任何法律，實均不能捨社會學之硏究方法者也。</p>

<h3>中學敎員的煩惱</h3>
<p>— （周庸）</p>
<p>人人都說敎育是淸高的事業，的確，那些夥計式的敎員，是當得起「淸高」兩個字，這意思是說：「淸」得貧苦，「高」得吊空。至於某些老闆式的校長，身邊麥克麥克，可不能說是「淸高」了。</p>
<p>最近孤島上的物價，一再高漲，生活程度較之戰前，幾乎高上一倍；但是薪水階級的工作，能有多少漲價？允其是做敎員的，非但沒有漲價，而且還要跌價。即以中學敎員而說，從前在公立中學裹，每小時敎薪有一元二角半，一元七角半，現在能得八角，一元的，已很難得；有的還把本來的六個月計薪制改作五個月計薪，讓敎員在每年的收入中落空了兩個月。至於私立中學，每小時敎薪三，四角是平常的事。但要知道，做敎員的，並不只是在課堂裏常着學生賣氣力；並且在課後還得費許多功夫去預備功課，批閱文卷……。所以，在今日的孤島上，做一個夥計式的敎員，即使終日忙得不亦苦乎，難免仍要爲家庭生活貼去一筆老本。</p>
<p>不過，能够拿到薪俸的，還算勝人一籌；更有些私立中學，每個月只發敎員幾塊錢的「車馬費」；你即使將它全部省下來，也只够自己吃一口苦飯。這事情自然並不普遍，可是的確也有。</p>
<p>敎員工資的跌價，說是因爲學校開支增加，也似乎不無理由。不過，有些學校是把學費提高了，大部份學校是增加了許多學生，至於原爲公立的學校也大都照舊領着津貼；而設備却是因陋就簡，不用破鈔。可見儘有不少學校的收入耍多於戰前；然而敎員的薪工，非但不隨之提高，倒反而减少。其甚者，學生增多而敎員裁减，以便實行包工制度；這種怪事，竟也會有。</p>
<p>以上只就敎員的物質景况而說，至於精神方面，也是煩惱。</p>
<p>敎育界如政界一樣，也常有什麼派系之爭。如果一個學校裹有兩個派系，那就甲派拉攏學生，乙派拉攏敎員，不免要發生明爭暗鬥。一個眞心辦敎育而能得學生信仰的敎員，或則被他們拉來拉去，而費掉許多寃枉功夫；或則被他們生疑猜忌，而嘗受種種攻訐指摘。在這樣的氛圍下，敎風掃地，學風自然無從整頓，更那裹談得到師道？</p>
<p>即在並無派系之爭的學校裹，做敎員的也未必愉快；攏絡老闆，敷衍同事，已經是够麻煩的事，而中學生又不像小學生那般馴服，因之還得賣好學生。一個敎員，倘想嚴格執行訓導，而不幸給一些放縱慣的學生所噓聲驅逐，那非特在精神上感到難堪，並且也眞有打破飯碗之虞。因爲有些學校的主持者，是不肯得罪顧客而寗可請夥計受屈的。</p>
<p>至於做一個敎員，而想請學校當局破費一點，添加設備；用力一點，促進敎學；以及經濟行政公開，師長學生合作等等；那不但人微言輕，並且忠言逆耳，疑心你是別有用心了。</p>
<p>尤其是現今的一般學校，對於敎職員的去留，直到放假以後，還不表示態度；聘書往往要到將近開學的時候這才發出。因此，做敎員的，每到學期終了，總要憂悶交集：下學期的職業好似吊在半空；而即使續聘，敎課是吾减少，這都成了做敎員的生活上的大問題</p>
<p>呵，淸高的敎員，在這樣的景况下，在良心上是要覺得痛苦，在精神上是要不免顫抖的。要使敎員的生活能得愉快，敎育的事業眞正「淸高」，我請求中國的敎育當局厲行後列幾個原則：</p>
<p>（一）採用人才主義：打破一切門戶之見，嚴禁一切派系之爭。</p>
<p>（二）抱定認眞態度：取締營業性質之學校；改革各校的設施；執行嚴格的敎學訓導。</p>
<p>（三）改良敎員待遇：提高敎員的薪酬，至低限度須能維持其家庭生活；並延長聘的的期限，使其生活安定。</p>
<p>（四）貫澈敎育精神：整個學校自校長，主任，敎員以至學生，校工，必須融合協作，破除隔閡，而向中國的敎育宗旨一致努力推進。</p>
<h3>「來源不足」！</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>暑期服務難童運動</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>中華基督敎靑年會，自衛生敎育運動週圓滿結束而後，接着少年部就發起一種暑期服務難童運動。這個運動的目標，是使少年部會員，利用暑期，得有服務的機會，使他們更明瞭服務的意義。而主要的一種工作，就是先從服務難童入手，帮助各收容所的敎員，推進難童的敎育工作，用意不可謂不善。</p>
<p>就筆者所知道的，上海的中華基督敎靑年會，所有會員的裏面，除了成人之外，更有少年，所以有成人部和少年部的分野；而未滿十六歲以下的兒童，都可加入靑年會爲少年會員。所收的會費，比成人耍低得多，但各種運動，圖書，浴室等設備，少年會友也得同樣享受。靑年會附設的日校，夜校，全體的同學，都是少年會員，而同時職業界方面，也有不少年輕的人加入爲少年會員，利用業餘的時間來進修的。一般的少年會員，除了實行集團生活，努力進修外，同時更時常利用時機，服務社會，和組織劇團，演講團，及設立義務夜校等。</p>
<p>這一次靑年會少年部開始作暑期服務難童運動而後，先從訓練入手，由該會愼重的選擇優秀會友若干人，加以特殊的訓練。經過了十天左右的訓練，便派往愚園路第十二收容所服務。爲求工作完善起見，開初的四星期，爲試辦時期，將來是吾繼續，要看服務的成績而定。每日服務的時間是下午二時至五時。採取小先生制度。敎材方面，分（一）唱歌，（二）團體遊戲，（三）名人故事，（四）公民敎育等，這樣在會友可獲得實習的機會，在難童可獲得知識的增進，眞兩得其益呢！</p>
<p>然而目前上海的難童很多，不但在收容所內，流浪在街頭尾巷的，數字怕不一定比在收容所的少。一般的難童，陷在失學的情狀之下，是正急切的需要人們去作義務敎導，使他們不致成爲文盲，而將來無論在自己的生活方面，對社會國象的貢獻方面，都可因識些字而增進效能，可知這種工作是多麼重要。另一面，有許多中等以上的識字的靑年，與其把兩個月假期光陰虛費掉，不若實行爲難童服務。所以我以爲暑期難童服務運動，要推廣到每一個角落裏的靑年身上，而推行到上海所有的收容所內的難童和街頭的流浪難童方面，才會有確切的效果。進一步，更不限暑期，就是暑假之後，要繼續推廣這種服務難童運動。</p>
<h3>鐵漢末路</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Ex-Champ”</p>
<p>看過了「海上煉獄」，覺得一個庸俗的導演對於演員是很大的損失。在「鐵漢末路」中，維克多麥克勞倫同樣被埋沒了。譬如麥克勞倫喝酒那縐戲，他是在多末沉痛的情緒下，借酒以澆愁，但是在導演者加了噱頭以後，使觀衆在轟笑之餘，直覺麥克勞倫在這塲戲中彷彿是一個丑角。</p>
<p>整個戲也同樣用一些細小的噱頭堆砌起來，父子間的不融洽，和麥克勞倫訓練鮑勃，並沒有適當地聯繫起來，以致整僩戲祗見許多瑣碎的塲面。就是最後的拳擊，也不能把拳塲上緊張的空氣抓住。</p>
<p>祗是麥克勞倫暗中在水中放了迷藥以後，他茫然地走出拳擊塲，到拳擊員休息室裏才注視手掌上的藥水，於是懷然地坐了下來。這里導演在把拳擊塲上的喊聲和低沉的音樂，陪襯麥克勞倫當時矛盾的情緒，處理得很好，可是在馬西進來以後，導演者又是把麥克勞倫的暈倒來博取觀衆的笑聲。</p>
<p>一個會榮任拳擊冠軍的拳師，因爲年老不能稱雄於拳塲，致淪爲看門者。兒子却熱戀着富家女而鄙視自己的父親，可是在兒子揮霍無度，濫用公款的時候，他還是舐犢情深，冀用非法的手段來博取巨款。這樣的故事而導演者把它寫成一個喜劇，自然無法挽回它的命運了。</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　烟火千家鄉村合作　波濤萬里瀛海飛行</p>
<p>第二件是買機器的事。貿機器與造房子，可以同時進行，方不虛糜光陰。但機器中有的中國已能自已製造了，有的却還不能自己製造。何家兩位小姐，在美國學的是紡綠工業，她們對於紡織機械，也粗知一點門徑。大槪留學在那一國的，都是信仰那一國的一切。她們留學在美國的，自然也信仰美國的一切了。所以她們的心中，倘然貿機器，一定要買美國機器。這事實在也是很合理的，她們學於美國，對於美國紡織界有些經騐，要是再換了別一國的機械，更是茫無頭緒了。不過現在世界上的物質文明，進步得很快，常常在那裏變動。俗語說得好：「眼睛一愛，老哺鷄變鴨。」她們雖然回國得不過兩三年，但是外國的情形，又變換了。她們覺得到美國要去定造機器，而定造機器，又非自己到美國去一趟不可。她們前兩天已經商議過了，她們說：『不願意當經理，却願意當工程師。』關於到美國去的事，她們也商量過。倒不專是爲了機器的事，她們爲了這織綢廠，預備做國外貿易，要把旣成織品，銷到國外去，因此非預先去考察一决不可。考察不必兩個人都去，只要去一個人就得了。或者兩人輪流出去，今年儷玉出去，明年雙玉出去，也無不可。因爲她們這兩個人，儷玉好動，雙玉好靜，當然儷玉願意先出去。雙玉也知道她的願望，所以倘然兩人之中，出去一人，她也情願讓儷玉先出去。前兩天晚上，她們姊妹就商量到這件事。儷玉道：『這件事，我們請命於父親。倘然父親答應我們兩人之中出去一人的，便請父親指派。父親指派誰出去的，誰就出去。』雙玉道：『我想不必請父親指派。回頭父親就說：你們自已商量定妥就是了，何必要我來指派？倘然決定出去了以後，簡直你先出去，這是有理由的，合該是你先出去。』儷玉道「：什麼理由呢？』雙玉道：『貴有自知之明，你比我好動，對於交際一切，你比我强。此番第一决出去，不無有酬酢宴會等事，還是你較爲合宜。還有的，是你曾經習過繪畫，紡織對於繪畫等等，有極密切的關係，這一件，也是你較爲相宜。』（一六五）</p>

<p>Observations by Foreign Affairs Observers</p>
<h3>Japan Plans a New General Offensive on Various Fronts in China, Xi'an, Yichang, and Nanning to be the Target of the Offensive, Fresh Army Divisions Gathered, Success or Failure Depends on This One Move</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to foreign military observers speaking to the Associated Press, the Japanese army seems to be planning another decisive offensive against various Chinese fronts in September, in an attempt to end the war. The primary targets of the offensive are Xi'an in Shaanxi, Yichang in Hubei, and Nanning in Guangxi. The scale of the offensive will be comparable to the Japanese army's previous offensives against Nanjing, Xuzhou, and Wuhan. To carry out this new general offensive, the Japanese plan to transfer seven to ten fresh army divisions from Japan to China. It is also reported that since the start of the Japanese invasion of China, the Japanese army in China has lost 60% of its strength. According to the foreign military observer, the success or failure of the Japanese military depends on this one move. (30th Associated Press telegram)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Denies Using Poison Gas</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a spokesman for the General Headquarters Military Affairs Department today, Tokyo's broadcast on July 27 claiming that the Chinese army used poison gas is a baseless fabrication and not worthy of laughter. The so-called document obtained by the Japanese as evidence is nothing more than a document abandoned by Japanese soldiers. Furthermore, China's current war of resistance against Japan is purely for justice, so why should we adopt such brutal and cruel war methods? (30th Associated Press telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Attempt to Invade Westward in Xinyang and Minggang Area Foiled, Japanese Troops in Guxian Town Have Already Retreated, Chinese Army is Searching and Advancing</h3>
<p>Nanyang The Japanese army's westward invasion of the Xinyang and Minggang area has been shattered by the Chinese army. The area north of Minggang has been cleared, and the area west of the Shige River has also been repelled by the Chinese army. The Japanese troops in Guxian Town and other places, under the pressure of the fresh Chinese forces, have also retreated. Currently, the Chinese army is searching and advancing, while a unit of the Japanese army is still entrenched at Huaihe Dian on the Nanxin Highway. (29th telegram)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The situation in southern Henan is still undergoing intense fighting. Observing the Japanese operational plan, it belongs to a three-pronged westward invasion: one from northwest of Minggang towards Biyang, one from San Guan Miao west through Wang Gang Maoji towards Huanggang Biyang, and one directly from Xinyang towards Tongbai, with the intention of capturing Guxian and Maoji southwest of Gu Xian as strongholds to support the two-pronged war. After the Chinese forces intercepted on all routes, the Japanese only occupied Wang Gang (west of Minggang) in the first route, and have been unable to advance to this day. The Japanese army in the second route once captured Huanggang, but was ambushed by the Chinese army from both sides, and most of them retreated to Maoji. On the evening of the 28th, more than 600 Japanese soldiers returned to Minggang. The Japanese army in the third route captured Ganhe Dian (east of Tongbai) on the 28th and is now engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. The Japanese troops that invaded north once captured Li Xin Dian, but were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army and have retreated back to Minggang. Currently, the main Chinese forces are advancing and counterattacking in separate routes, and a new situation is expected to unfold within the next few days. (29th telegram)</p>
<p>Nanyang A phone call from Tongbai this morning stated that the Japanese troops in the Minggang and Xinyang area have invaded westward in two groups. The Japanese troops along the Xin-Nan Highway are invading villages such as Liuzhuang in Guxian Town, setting fires and destroying a large number of houses. The Japanese troops invading west from Minggang consist of 3,000 infantry, 3,000 cavalry, more than 100 trucks, and over 10 tanks, have crossed the Huai River and invaded Wucheng Town. The county troops from Hua, Biyang and Tongbai have gathered to prepare for a fierce battle. (28th telegram)</p>
<p>Fancheng The more than 2,000 Japanese troops invading west from Minggang were forced to retreat to Minggang on the 29th after being attacked by the Chinese army in multiple directions. Currently, Maoji Lantang near the front of Guxian Town, southwest of Minggang, are controlled by the Chinese side. At the same time, the Chinese army is advancing step by step, forming a pincer-shaped encirclement to compress the Japanese army. (30th telegram)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The Chinese army has been counterattacking in southern Henan for days and has been gaining ground. The main forces have been reporting frequent victories everywhere. In summary, the Japanese troops who invaded west in three routes have suffered serious blows. The Japanese troops who captured Wagang in the north have already returned to Minggang. The Japanese troops in Maoji in the central route have been desperately intercepted by the Chinese and have also collapsed eastward in a sorry state. There are no traces of the Japanese west of Landian (west of Minggang). The Japanese troops in Yuehe Dian (east of Tongbai) in the south were more rampant, but after the Chinese troops and local forces led by Hua forces surrounded and attacked from all sides, most of them also collapsed. The brave soldiers from various Chinese routes in Wujia Dian (west of Xinyang) are pursuing their victory. (30th telegram)</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Chen Yong Solely Donates Huge Sum of Money</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang Commends Him</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang, according to a report from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, received a telegram from the Consulate in Kuala Lumpur stating that Chen Yong, a leader of the overseas Chinese community in that city, had solely donated 250,000 yuan to support the war of resistance. He deeply appreciated the patriotism of this overseas Chinese compatriot, which is enough to set an example and serve as a model. He sent a special telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to be forwarded to the Consulate in Kuala Lumpur, conveying his commendation. (30th telegram)</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander Heroically Sacrifices His Life</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) On the 21st of last month, Yuan Zhizhong, Liu Deshan, Li Kun, and Li Xuanting, company commanders of a certain unit in the ×th War Zone, were ordered to rush to support the troops amidst heavy rain and muddy conditions. At Xiajiashan, they engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese army all day long. Although Yuan and others were seriously injured, they still held their positions and launched brave attacks, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese army. The next morning, the Japanese army reinforced and counterattacked, and they continued to engage in hand-to-hand combat, leading to their heroic sacrifice. Among them, Liu Deshan was the most heroic. During hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army, he was shot seven times but still stood up and fought bravely, taking on ten men at once. When his bodyguard, Hou Qingshan, went to rescue him, Liu firmly refused to retreat, saying, "I am seriously injured and cannot survive even if I retreat." He then heroically sacrificed himself in this battle. After receiving the report, the commander of the unit stated that the sacrifice of the company commanders was heroic and could serve as an example for the entire army. He specially reported it to the Ministry and requested posthumous compensation in accordance with the law. It is said that the highest authorities will commend him to publicize his heroism.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>International Developments Underway</h3>
<p>The Sino-Japanese war, the situation in the Far East, and even the general international welfare and security, are all entering a critical period of development in the short term.</p>
<p>We do not want to speak presumptuously about the conclusion of the developments we believe in. Moreover, after these developments, the situation may become even more dire on one or more fronts due to retrograde actions. However, the current developments do have the potential to produce good results, and provide an opportunity to pursue good results. How things ultimately turn out depends on the efforts of rational individuals around the world. What we want to emphasize is that we hope that rational individuals from all countries in the world will respond to each other's calls and work together on the basis of common and fair principles!</p>
<p>What are these common and fair principles? Some may think it is a particular ideology, believing that the world will be united as one family if a single ideology is practiced everywhere. This is a foolish fantasy that will never come true. Let's not talk about the different doctrines of communism, national socialism, and fascism, which can only be allowed to live and die within their own tribes, and at most, slightly influence the surrounding areas. Let's not talk about the incompatibility of communism with national socialism and fascism. Even national socialism and fascism cannot unite Germany and Italy into one country. As for democracy, we adhere to it and sincerely support it as the orthodox political system and thought of civilized mankind. However, why should we eliminate "heresy" with democracy? Therefore, using ideology as a rallying cry, or using "anti-" a certain ideology as a rallying cry, are not common and fair principles. This is one point. Others believe it is peace, arguing that peace is a common aspiration of mankind, and justice will prevail under peace. This is either a hypothetical ideal of anarchism or a hypothetical ideal of militarism. Because peace has its indispensable conditions. Anarchists assume that the causes of non-peace have been completely eliminated, while militarists assume that the opposing forces will eventually be completely eliminated. Is this possible? The key condition for peace is justice. Seeking peace without justice only results in the sacrifice of Czechoslovakia for peace, without seeing the protection of justice by the United Kingdom. Japan's unjust aggression destroyed peace. China's resistance to injustice and war is not reckless for peace. Therefore, to speak of peace without regard for everything is by no means a common and fair principle of mankind. This is the second point. These two are used by the cunning, confused, violent, and cowardly elements of the international community, each taking what is convenient for them as a banner, and they are all wrong.</p>
<p>What are the common and fair principles of the international community? To put it simply: Each country should uphold the integrity of its sovereignty, territory, and administration, respect the integrity of other countries' sovereignty, territory, and administration, and assist other countries in maintaining the integrity of their sovereignty, territory, and administration. That's all, that's all. All international actions that conform to this goal are extremely right and proper, and those that violate this goal are extremely wrong and absurd. Cooperate and strive for what is extremely right and proper, and cooperate and strive to correct what is extremely wrong and absurd. This is what rational individuals from all countries in the world should overcome all difficulties, prepare for sacrifice and pain, and devote all their efforts to achieve. Why are we so leisurely discussing these old sayings? Because these common and fair principles are inherently reasonable and indestructible. However, some people deliberately destroy them, some people ignore them because of their ignorance, some people condone and indulge them for the sake of short-term and petty gains, and some people are intimidated by violence and accustomed to pleasure and dare not face this goal squarely. There are also those who, based on population, economy, or a certain page or fragment of history, or a certain exaggerated traditional myth, claim that the sovereignty, territory, and administration of other countries should be destroyed, reduced, or changed. This is either sophistry or delusion, because sovereignty, territory, and administration have a definite definition, a clear fact, and a clear scope. What they use as a basis has no standards and only serves to cover up their ambitions. If population, economy, etc., are problems in themselves that need to be solved, then they should also be solved fairly under the integrity of sovereignty, territory, and administration. Delusions deceive oneself and others, and sophistry deceives oneself and others, while international disputes are reflected in them. Can old sayings be stopped?</p>
<p>Observing today's international phenomena: Apart from the war between China and Japan, which is a concrete action that determines the future and which China is irretrievably committed to, which needs no discussion, in addition, (1) the United States is clear, strong, and resolute, and has recently made a preliminary expression that conforms to the aforementioned common and fair principles. We firmly believe that the United States will follow this path and develop and strengthen the aforementioned principles, establishing them as a permanent and solid foundation for the international community. However, this preliminary expression is by no means the end. There is a great distance between the preliminary stage and the completion of the process. To shorten the distance in space, it is necessary to follow up with effective actions. To shorten the distance in time, it is necessary to act swiftly and decisively. How will the United States act? When will the United States act? There are rumors that the U.S. authorities are observing the changing times and will decide on the next steps. One is to observe domestic public opinion, the second is to observe the Japanese reaction, and the third is to observe the evolution of the European situation. It is necessary to be prudent and deliberate in planning the country, but a country that is in a leading position in the international community and has the power to influence the situation must attach importance to taking the initiative in developing strategies. If it delays too much, or if its hesitation and lack of resolve are misunderstood, or if its preliminary expression is misunderstood as empty threats, then its observation will be excessive. (2) The United Kingdom is making efforts in Tokyo and Moscow. Regarding the negotiations in Moscow, we sympathize with the United Kingdom's efforts to compromise, but if the former Prime Minister Lloyd George is still attacking Chamberlain for this, then there must be some incomprehensible inside story? What is this inside story that has been developing for so long! As for the negotiations in Tokyo, the previous preliminary agreement may have had justifiable circumstances, but its actions were absolutely unforgivable. International affairs are related to reality and must involve interests, so one must discuss actions and not emotions. Whoever has grudges and prejudices will be praised as a friend, otherwise they will be rejected and abandoned. Therefore, one must not make any concessions. The worldwide condemnation of the preliminary agreement was self-inflicted. However, the British attitude that has been reported over the past 113 days has been quite tough and will be praised by the world. However, as of now, things are not yet certain. Will the British diplomatic outpost in Tokyo fight unyieldingly for Far Eastern interests and the common and fair principles of the international community? Or will it give up its interests, violate principles, cut itself off from 450 million friendly people, and retreat to Singapore? This will become clear in the short term. Before this is clear, even the friendliest countries to the United Kingdom can only objectively argue that the choice of action is still developing. (3) Japan aspires to dominate the Far East, but lacks justification and power. However, in today's disputes, its decision-making mechanism can still be manipulated and utilized, unlike China, which is forced to resist and strive for survival. From the perspective of common and fair international principles, Japan has no justification and should retreat. However, Japanese-style thought and theory, due to education and traditional attitudes, seem to have never understood this principle. China's resolute resistance has failed to enlighten their understanding. Although countries have shown moral aversion, they have not stopped economic and political exchanges, and they have not stopped tolerating and enduring their violence. This has blocked their due understanding. Therefore, Japan's deep-rooted deviance is not only their own fault but also the fault of other countries. Even today, we would still present new evidence if Japan could humbly accept the above principles and change its course. However, the clear and strong preliminary expression of the United States is at least enough to make Japan realize that the United States cannot tolerate Japan's actions. It is said that Reuters' Tokyo dispatch recently stated that Japan's long-standing misunderstanding of the United States has been shattered by this, which must be true. Following the preliminary expression of the United States, American public opinion has transcended partisan disputes and praised the government, which shows national unity. World public opinion has praised the United States in unison, which shows global unity. The British attitude is said to be hardening, which shows Anglo-American unity. The economic and political exchanges that countries have had with Japan for years will no longer be the same. Japan's decision-making mechanism can still be manipulated and utilized. Should it not take this opportunity to change course and preserve its remaining strength and its international standing? Should it not graciously withdraw and reconcile with 450 million people under the common and fair principles of the international community? Or should it wait for other opportunities for international deterioration and seek good fortune? Or should it go its own way, be willing to fight against all countries, and ultimately destroy its remaining strength and plunge itself into an irrecoverable abyss? We dare not expect Japan to quickly conform to common sense and reason, but in today's environment, rational individuals in Japan should take this as an opportunity to restrain their sharp edges, change their course, and strive to develop a new policy shift. After all, Japan is not comparable to China, which is forced to resist and has no choice but to fight.</p>
<h3>Encouraged by the US Abolishing Treaty, the UK Adopts a Stronger Stance Towards Japan: Demands the Lifting of the Blockade and the Cessation of Anti-British Activities; Tianjin Case Round Table Conference Continues Today</h3>
<p>(London) News from here last night: British Foreign Secretary Halifax has issued new instructions to the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, questioning Japan's instigation of anti-British movements in the Far East, and demanding that the Japanese authorities lift the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. When representatives from both sides resume negotiations on the Tianjin case tomorrow, the British Ambassador will, in accordance with the new instructions, demand that the Japanese side cease anti-British movements and lift the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin. As for the new instructions issued by Foreign Secretary Halifax, there was speculation last night regarding whether it included a threat of breaking off negotiations with Japan. However, at a minimum, the British Ambassador will inform the Japanese side that the continuation of anti-British movements and the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin will affect subsequent negotiations in Tokyo. Diplomatic circles here believe that the UK's new move is due to the US's tougher stance towards Japan. It is reported that the Washington government announced last week the abolition of the 1911 US-Japan commercial treaty. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Arita met with the Japanese Emperor yesterday afternoon to report on the progress of the Tokyo Conference. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prior to the sixth UK-Japan talks to be held tomorrow, the "Economic Situation Investigation Committee" will meet at 9:00 am at the official residence of the Foreign Affairs Ministry. Those attending include Mr. Tanaka, Mr. Asami, and Mr. Aoki, all three ministry officials, as well as Mr. Macrae, the British Commercial Counselor to Japan, and Mr. Harvard, a consul. They will discuss the issue of transferring legal tender and silver based on concrete facts. The Japanese side will do its utmost to explain that if this issue cannot be resolved in reality, the maintenance of public order in North China and the survival of the Japanese army will not be secured, in order to promote British recognition. The sixth talks will begin at 4:00 pm. Furthermore, Mr. Dinnis, the Chief of the Tianjin Municipal Police Department, arrived in Tokyo yesterday evening after being summoned by Ambassador Craigie, bringing with him local data regarding the details of decisions reserved in the public order issue. Therefore, before discussing economic issues, the details of the security and police issues may be reviewed first in order to finalize the issue. If the discussion involves economic issues, it will likely be based on the deliberations of the morning subcommittee to find a way to resolve the theoretical conflicts in the previous talks.

<h3>Canada's Trade Surplus with Japan; Willing to Sacrifice Interests if UK Declares Abolition of Treaty</h3>
<p>Ottawa: While local newspapers fully support the US's announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, business figures deeply fear that if the Tokyo talks between the UK and Japan are unsuccessful, the UK may follow the US and declare the abolition of the UK-Japan commercial treaty, which is not without concern. In the past three years, Canada has sold goods worth 80 million Canadian dollars to Japan, mainly metals used for manufacturing armaments, while its imports from Japan are only worth 25 million Canadian dollars, resulting in a large trade surplus. The Canadian government is under pressure from public opinion to refuse to prohibit the shipment of raw materials for manufacturing armaments to Japan, which is also the reason. The government argues that prohibiting the shipment of raw materials to Japan will be ineffective without cooperation from other countries, especially the US. However, according to the Montreal Daily News, if the UK-Japan commercial treaty is abolished, Canada's trade with Japan will automatically cease. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<h3>Sassoon Arrives in America</h3>
<p>Newark, New Jersey: Sir Victor Sassoon, a Shanghai tycoon, arrived here yesterday from San Francisco, refusing to reveal his mission and purpose in coming to the US, and refusing to talk about the situation in China. Sir Sassoon is travelling to New York from here. Sir Victor Sassoon's decision to come to the US has aroused much speculation here, as he only said he was going to Honolulu when he left Shanghai.

<p>Three Chinese Organizations Cable British Prime Minister, Urging Him to Stop Tokyo Talks; Also Cable US President, Congratulating Him on Abolishing the US-Japan Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to sources in charge here today, seven organizations, including the Sino-British Cultural Association, the Sino-American Cultural Association, the Sino-French-Belgian and Swiss Cultural Association, the Sino-Soviet Cultural Association, the China League of Nations Association, the Chinese People's Foreign Affairs Association, and the Chinese Branch of the International Peace Movement, held a joint meeting yesterday to discuss the UK-Japan conference and the US's abolition of the commercial treaty with Japan. As a result, it was decided to cable British Prime Minister Chamberlain, urging him to (1) stop the Tokyo talks, and (2) take action parallel to that of the US. At the same time, it was planned to cable President Roosevelt, congratulating him on his decision to abolish the US-Japan Commercial and Navigation Treaty. All the above cables were drafted at the meeting and are now being sent to the leaders of each organization for signature. It is expected that they will be sent to London and Washington today. The British chairman of the Sino-British Cultural Association is the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, and the Chinese chairman is former Minister of Education Wang Shijie. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Currently, due to concerns from various parties regarding the involvement of cultural associations in political events, according to reliable sources, the cables to Chamberlain and Roosevelt will only be signed by three organizations, including the Chinese Branch of the International Peace Movement, and the four cultural associations will not participate. The Chinese Branch of the International Peace Movement has approximately 200,000 members. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) This morning, Chinese-language newspapers here expressed great concern about the future of the UK-Japan Conference. It is said that Chinese people, in view of the past friendship and cooperation between China and the UK, cannot help but feel disappointed with this Tokyo plan. Although the British side has repeatedly stated that the Tokyo plan does not contain any changes in the UK's policy towards China, the Chinese people still feel deeply concerned about the progress of the Tokyo talks. The newspaper also stated that Japan is currently promoting the smooth progress of the Tokyo Conference on the one hand, while expanding anti-British riots on the other. Therefore, the Tokyo Conference will have no compromise solution except for complete surrender by the UK. The Chinese authorities and public organizations are now considering how to advise the UK to stop the Tokyo talks immediately, not to mediate with Japan, and to adopt parallel actions with the US, as well as a strict and resolute policy to deal with Japan. This matter is under thorough consideration by the Chinese authorities and public organizations, and its final decision will be noteworthy. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The United Daily News here published an article today entitled "Prospects After the Abolition of the US-Japan Treaty," stating that the US's position in the Far East is very different from that of the UK and France, because the UK and France are both located in Europe, while the US is a Pacific nation. The US occupies the position of leader of the Pacific nations, and no one has ever argued with it due to historical and geographical relations. The article concluded by saying that now is a good opportunity for the US to take active measures to prevent Japan's aggression in the Far East. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Utilizing Economic Weapons Sufficient to Force Japan to Submit; British Newspaper Praises Roosevelt's Great Achievements; Urges UK, US, and Soviet Union to Cooperate Effectively</h3>
<p>(London) The Times commented on the US's announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, stating, "American public opinion has always sympathized with China's resistance and has been hostile to Japanese aggression. However, in the past two years, it has strictly adhered to a policy of non-intervention. This sudden change in attitude is probably due to the fact that American residents in North China have also been insulted by Japanese soldiers. The US has always attached great importance to attacks on its own people, and is not constrained by the threat of war like European countries, so it can calmly take action. This shows that the US is unwilling to sit idly by and watch the power of Western countries in China be completely excluded. The UK may be able to follow suit under certain circumstances, but it is not certain that the US is willing to cooperate with the UK to protect the common interests of both sides and prevent Japan from harming them." The Observer enthusiastically praised President Roosevelt, saying that the abolition of the treaty "is one of the greatest achievements of the President's life. His decision was well-thought-out and supported by the public, which has shown Japan that the US's patience also has its limits. The President is not only courageous, but also tactful, and did not notify the UK and France in advance, which is sufficient to prove his spirit of observing the Constitution. It is imaginable that Tokyo heard it like thunder." In our country, for the Far East issue, we should follow the US in both commercial and political aspects, and then find ways to make the negotiations between the UK, France, and the Soviet Union successful. If our country cooperates effectively with the US and the Soviet Union, it will be able to contain Japan and prevent China from being conquered. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The Observer's diplomatic correspondent wrote an editorial yesterday, saying that the British diplomatic community today recognizes that the US's abolition of the commercial treaty with Japan is not only crucial in US-Japan relations, but also has a great impact on the possibility of the UK deciding to take the same step, and acknowledges that the economic weapons of the two countries have immeasurable value compared to what one country alone can hope for. While the meeting on the Tianjin incident is in progress, there cannot immediately be a question of the UK following the US, but the possibility of the UK taking such a step in the future is now a factor in the Far Eastern situation, and it is expected to have an impact on the Tokyo Conference itself.

<h3>Japanese University Professors Worry About National Fate; Jointly Appeal to US; Ask Them to Consider Old Friendship</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Federation of Japanese University Professors held a meeting here yesterday and passed a resolution asking the US government to carefully consider its abrupt unilateral action of abolishing the US-Japan commercial treaty. The resolution was delivered to the US authorities in Tokyo by Professor Negishi of St. Paul's University and Professor Komatsu of Nihon University, representing the Federation. The resolution stated: "In view of the friendly relations between Japan and the US in the past eighty years, the unilateral act of your government announcing the abolition of the commercial treaty is regrettable. The Federation of Japanese University Professors hereby requests your country to give this matter careful consideration." (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Attaché to Soviet Union Declines Invitation to Farewell Banquet; Briefly Vents Resentment</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Diplomatic circles here are commenting today on the fact that five Japanese army attachés refused to attend a farewell reception for Major Shea, the US army attaché, last night. However, according to the Japanese army attaché, there was "another meeting" when they accepted the invitation. Diplomatic circles here pointed out that last night's incident was related to the Washington government's abolition of the 1911 US-Japan commercial treaty last week. Others believed that the Japanese army attaché was retaliating for an incident a few weeks ago, when Major Shea and British air force attaché Howell left the Japanese embassy without waiting for the screening of a newsreel showing Japanese planes bombing Chinese cities to finish. (Associated Press, 30th)</p>
<h3>British and American Strategies Towards Japan; Must Have Been Contacted in Advance; Observations of Roman Newspaper</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian newspapers have been commenting on the US government's announcement of the abolition of the US-Japan commercial treaty, mostly following the line of argument held by the Italian Daily yesterday, accusing the UK and the US of colluding, saying that President Roosevelt had subtly consulted the British government before abolishing the treaty, and that the UK's submission to Japan a few days ago was only superficial. The Fascist Labor News stated, "The UK has been encouraged by the US's abolition of the treaty and is preparing to participate in anti-Japanese economic measures. This is actually a crusade against totalitarian states, led by President Roosevelt. The UK has now discarded its mask, so it is not an exaggeration to say that the country is not sincere in holding talks with Japan." The Evening Post stated, "The US's move is a political expression and clearly has hostile intentions towards Japan, but the major democracies may not benefit from it. President Roosevelt probably wants to show the UK how to take a tough stance in the Far East. However, the will of the totalitarian countries is strong and their understanding is firm and unparalleled. President Roosevelt's family and several confidants want to see him step down, so they are using this kind of provocative strategy, hoping that he will cling to power because of it, but it will only harm himself. This is what President Roosevelt should know." (Havas, 29th)</p>

<h3>Defending Against Aggression is Interdependent; Soviet Union Decides to Continue Aiding China; Promises Large Loan for Purchase of Armaments; Sun Ke Negotiates in Moscow</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the Soviet Union's granting of a commercial credit loan of 750 million rubles to China, informed sources here said they had no knowledge of it, but the Soviet Union is currently continuing to provide China with substantial assistance, which is beyond doubt after the visit of Sun Ke, President of the Chinese Legislative Yuan. This is also evident from the statement made by Soviet People's Commissar and Foreign Minister Molotov in the Soviet Supreme Soviet. Authoritative observers say that China's heroic resistance has achieved unexpected results, and Japan has therefore failed to attack the Soviet Far Eastern border in the autumn of 1937. The Soviet Union considers it beneficial to continue to aid China, and its financial assistance will take the form of credit loans to enable China to purchase armaments from the Soviet Union.

<h3>Important Changes to Commanders of Far Eastern Red Army; Rumors of Blücher's Reinstatement</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government recently issued an order stating that General Stern, Commander-in-Chief of the Far Eastern Red Army, has been assigned to another post, and the vacancy will be filled by Chief of Staff General Popov. General Stern was originally Chief of Staff to General Blücher, and had made outstanding contributions in the Changkufeng Incident last year, and had been awarded the Order of Lenin. Observers are surprised by the reason for his dismissal. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: According to reliable sources from Moscow in the "Warsaw Times," a Soviet-Japanese war is likely to break out in the near future. The recent major changes in the commanding generals of the Soviet Far Eastern Red Army, as well as the issue of General Blücher's reinstatement, are related to the development of this matter. The newspaper continued to say that after the dismissal of General Stern, commander of the First Special Army of the Soviet Far East, many of his subordinates and personnel from the political department of the Far Eastern Red Army were arrested by the authorities because they had falsely accused General Blücher of baseless crimes, which weakened the combat effectiveness of the Far Eastern Red Army. It is said that the Soviet administrative authorities are now trying to exonerate General Blücher, restore his position, and revitalize the military discipline and war spirit of the Far Eastern Army.

<h3>North Sakhalin Island Oil Rights Dispute; Soviet Union Has Not Enforced Seizure; Negotiations are in Progress</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government notified the Japanese Embassy last night that if the Japanese side concludes an agreement with the Soviet Union recognizing that the Japanese side must be subject to Soviet law, then the Soviet Union will not enforce the judgment of a 500,000 ruble fine. (Associated Press, 30th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to reliable sources, the Soviet authorities in North Sakhalin Island have notified those on the Japanese side who enjoy oil and coal concession rights that if a satisfactory solution is obtained, the fine of 500,000 rubles recently ruled by the court may not be paid under seizure procedures. At the same time, a Soviet newspaper published an article stating that we believe the Japanese side's claim that the Soviet Union intends to end the Japanese concession rights. The Soviet authorities recently earnestly stated that the Japanese people can still operate their concession rights, but they must strictly abide by the contract obligations and Soviet law. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Sakhalin Island Japanese commercial oil and coal mining companies have been fined 374,000 rubles by the Soviet court for violating their contracts with the Soviet trade union, and the companies were ordered to pay the full amount by the 19th of this month, otherwise their assets would be seized. The Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Tōgō Shigenori, protested to the Soviet government, and at the same time, the Japanese commercial companies conducted negotiations with the Soviet side. This was the situation a few days ago. According to news from Aleksandrovsk-Sakhalinsky, Sakhalin Island, the Soviet authorities have notified the Japanese commercial companies that they do not intend to implement the seizure, so the supervisors say that although the negotiations between the two sides may be delayed, a compromise solution can ultimately be reached.

<h3>Chinese Guerrillas Active in Northern Jiangxi; Japanese Suffers Severe Blows; De Rui Road Base Completely Destroyed; Ruiwu Road Outposts Also Recaptured</h3>
<p>Zhangshu: After the Japanese occupied Nanchang, their forces were insufficient, and the rear of northern Jiangxi was very empty. As a result, Chinese guerrillas launched long-term mobile attacks. The Japanese army's strategy of defending strongholds and lines in northern Jiangxi has recently suffered severe blows from the Chinese military. For example, the De Rui and Ruiwu Roads are the transportation hubs of the Japanese in northern Jiangxi. After the Chinese guerrillas continuously attacked the outposts along the De Rui Road, the Japanese army felt extremely threatened and was forced to abandon them automatically last month. After the Chinese completely destroyed the De Rui Road base, they recently continued to attack the Ruiwu Road. After more than thirty battles, the Japanese suffered heavy losses. The Chinese then recaptured Yejiaxiang, Dawenhe, Da'ao, Xiao'ao, Fengjiapu, and Henggang Village on the Ruiwu Road and sent troops to garrison them. At the same time, they also completely destroyed the 50 li-long highway, turning the road base into a pond. Currently, the Japanese's road transportation on the Ruiwu Road can only reach Fanjiapu from Ruichang, which is only more than 30 li long. In order to force the Japanese to completely abandon the road, fierce battles are being waged near Fanjiapu. (Telegraph, 29th)</p>
<h3>One Week of War Situation: 23rd to 29th</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Spokesperson of the Military Committee said, since this week, the Japanese army has been moving troops frequently on all fronts, especially the so-called "mopping-up" battle in southeastern Shanxi, which is more intense. However, after our continuous attacks, they have suffered heavy losses and are now gradually entering a state of silence. Regarding the course of the battle, the important ones are described below:</p>
<p>Shanxi: On the southeastern Shanxi front, after our army successively recaptured Yangcheng and Qinshui on the 25th and 26th, the Japanese offensive has recently stalled and the battle situation has turned to silence. Since the beginning of this month, the Japanese army has moved out in six routes, one route from Xiyang and Heshun to the south, one route from Bo'ai to the north, one route from Wu'an to the west, and three routes from Taigu, Anze, Yicheng, etc., to invade westward, attempting to "clear" our army in the area in one fell swoop. However, they suffered from our soldiers' continuous attacks, the continuous rain on the battlefield, and our people's firm policy of clearing the fields, so the Japanese army that invaded southward along the Baijin Highway, although repeatedly attacked our strongholds such as Xiangyuan, Tunliu, and Lucheng, were decisively able to recapture Yushe and Wuxiang after our army reinforced and pursued them. The Japanese army that invaded eastward from Yicheng, captured our Yangcheng, Jincheng, and Huguan, and we intercepted them midway, successively recapturing Zhongcun, Dongfeng, Yangcheng, Qinshui, and other strongholds, and killed nearly a thousand Japanese in the two battles of Lanche and Zhen. In the victory of Dongfeng, the Yamazaki Regiment infantry artillery unit, known for its elite, was almost completely wiped out by the Japanese. Now Qincheng has been surrounded by us, and the Japanese are actively reinforcing and preparing to counterattack. As for the triangular area of southern Shanxi, our two armies have also had fierce battles for days, and Dongcun Station east of Yuxiang and Qinghua Town have been recovered, and the Datong-Pukou Railway traffic has been cut off. The key points southeast of Xiaxian City are also all in our hands, and the siege is in progress.</p>
<p>Henan and Hubei: On the southern Henan front, our army launched a fierce attack on Xinyang and Changtaiguan in separate routes last week, breaking into the north and south gates of Xinyang again, occupying the station, and recapturing the outposts northwest of Changtaiguan. Since the 23rd, the Japanese have been constantly reinforcing and counterattacking. More than 3,000 Japanese troops invading northward from Changtaiguan, combined with tanks and aircraft assistance, captured our Minggang on the 24th. Our army fought fiercely and once recaptured it. More than 2,000 Japanese troops invading westward from Xinyang, part of which bypassed Minggang to the north, were met with our separate attacks, and fierce battles took place in Sanguanmiao, Yangmiao, Yaomen, Guxianzhen, and other places. In this battle, the number of Japanese casualties, including Minggang and Yaomen, has exceeded 1,000. The battle is still going on fiercely. As for the various routes in western Hubei, our army has launched attacks on the Japanese army for days, recovering many places. On the northern Hubei front, Leigutang, an outpost near Suixian County, was captured on the 25th, and the county seat has been surrounded. On the central Hubei front, Yangzi, Zhujiamiao, and Yangji northeast of Zhongxiang were stormed on the 23rd, and Lejiatan was recaptured. On the same day, Baoshuan, Yingjialing, and Duoxianghe near Qianjiang were recaptured, and they are now advancing towards the county seat. On the southern Hubei front, Mushigang was captured once on the 23rd, Chongyang was stormed on the 25th, and Tingsiqiao and Daxian were captured on the 26th, cutting off the northern section of the Yuehan Railway.</p>
<p>Guangdong: The Japanese army occupying Chao'an, after our fierce counterattack, broke into the city again on the 17th and 22nd, fighting fiercely for several days and nights. A part of the main force of the Japanese Maori Regiment was wiped out by us. We have continued to mop up the area for days, and there is no Japanese trace in Yunli Kongqiuchi Anbu in the west, Guanchao Gulou Jinshi Shaxi in the northwest, and Dahao in the east. At the same time, the Japanese army that occupied Chenghai on the 17th also retreated to the Waishe area south of the city to wait for reinforcements due to the threat. Also, the Japanese army that landed in Shanwei has all retreated after our army bravely welcomed them. The battle situation has now become calm. As for the northwest Liangjiang area, the Japanese army in Sanshui, Xinhui, and Shengang have been attacking Yangmei, Liantang, Yinxidong, and other places for days, and have fought with our army in Xinyu, Fenshui, and Shitanling. The Japanese have not succeeded and have retreated to their original positions. On the 25th, our army once stormed the Japanese positions in Xinyu and seized many spoils. At the Hengmen estuary in Zhongshan, Japanese warships took the opportunity to provide artillery cover on the morning of the 24th, and infantry landed. Our army gave them a head-on blow, and the Japanese did not succeed. In addition, Jizhong regained Jiuzhou and other places along the Beining line and approached Langfang, stormed Wangguanzhuang south of Qinghe, besieged the counties of Lingxian, Linqing, and Chiping, burned the munitions warehouse in Gaomi, recovered Ma'anshan in northern Hunan, once captured Yanglousi, surrounded Linxiang, recaptured Huafang and other outposts in northern Jiangxi, forced the outskirts of Ruichang and Jing'an counties, and defeated the Japanese army that invaded Lizhuang from Nanchang. In northern Anhui, Huaiyuan was recaptured, and a large Japanese ship near Dongliu was destroyed. In western Zhejiang, Xingu Town in Tongxiang was stormed, and the Japanese captain Yamada was killed.

<h3>Anti-British Movement Takes Another Step</h3>
<p>(Beijing) Sixteen British missionaries from the Taiyuan Baptist Hospital, who were expelled by the local anti-British movement and came to Beijing, are currently being blocked in Shijiazhuang due to the severe floods that have completely disrupted traffic on the Pinghan Railway. Almost all British missionaries in Shanxi Province have been expelled, but the fate of the few who live in southern Shanxi, whose news has been cut off for a long time, is still unknown. The anti-British movement in Beijing has now taken another step. The police have gone to various Chinese shops, instructing them to remove all British goods and transport them elsewhere, because British goods are not allowed to be sold here. It is now known that Chinese business groups held a secret meeting this week and passed a resolution opposing the exclusion of British goods, saying that the current business is already depressed and should not be disturbed again. It is said that this resolution has been notified to the leaders of the anti-British movement. (Reuters, 30th)</p>

<h3>Garrison Troops in Hong Kong to be Rotated</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The British Army's 2nd Battalion, King's Own Scottish Borderers, will soon be transferred to Hong Kong to relieve the current garrison. The Scottish troops of the Middlesex Regiment stationed in Hong Kong will be transferred to the Mediterranean, including Malta, and British troops from Essex, England, will also be transferred to Hong Kong to strengthen the garrison. The defense of Shanghai may be taken over by the Tyneside Scottish, with troops transferred from elsewhere to Tianjin. Furthermore, the Hong Kong government has approved the construction of an air defense headquarters in Happy Valley, with construction commencing in August and expected to be completed by the end of the year. The Compulsory Service Ordinance and the Naval Volunteer Ordinance will come into effect on August 1st. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>American Church School Bombed in Wuzhou</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Eighteen Japanese bombers bombed densely populated areas within Wuzhou city, Guangxi, on the 26th. The Red Cross Hospital was hit by two bombs, and the Bible school run by the American Baptist Church was destroyed by eight incendiary bombs. Sixty civilians were killed and thirty wounded. (30th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to official reports, eighteen Japanese aircraft yesterday indiscriminately dropped bombs on densely populated residential areas of Wuzhou. Even the Red Cross Hospital was hit by two bombs, and the Bible school run by the American Baptist Church was struck by eight incendiary bombs. The Japanese aircraft dropped over a hundred bombs in total, resulting in sixty civilian deaths and three hundred and thirty injuries. It is a tragedy. (30th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bank of Communications and Bank of China in Chongqing Provide Loans to Refugees</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news from here today, four hundred refugees here have already obtained 20,000 yuan in loans from the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China, enabling them to re-establish small shops, small workshops, and small businesses such as miscellaneous goods stalls. The two banks have prepared a total of 600,000 yuan in loans for refugees, but due to a lack of guarantors, the loans have not been issued. It is reported that the method of providing loans to refugees by the two banks is for the refugees to provide mutual guarantees, in other words, a refugee who wants to obtain a loan must have three other refugees act as guarantors. The amount of the loan ranges from five to eight hundred yuan, depending on the refugee's ability to repay the debt and the profitability of their business. Most of the loans are given to refugees currently living outside the city, and small workshops outside the city are allowed to obtain the most loans because they are less likely to be attacked by airplanes.

<h3>Excerpts from French Press Commentaries on the Far Eastern Situation</h3>
<p>(Paris) The revocation of the US-Japan Commercial Treaty by the American government continues to receive positive reviews from local morning newspapers. A right-wing newspaper stated, "The revocation is a serious warning to Japan, and this is also the view in Tokyo. The United States, in recent events, has deliberately not expressed solidarity with other countries. This decision came suddenly, and the Japanese side is even more surprised. According to the commercial situation between the United States and Japan, the United States sells twice as many goods to Japan as it purchases from Japan, which is extremely beneficial to the United States. Now, by revoking the existing commercial treaty, President Roosevelt, in addition to achieving a political victory, probably also wants to make a good deal. The so-called political victory is because the issue of amending the Neutrality Act suffered a setback, so he took this opportunity, with public opinion as his backing, to wipe out the previous humiliation. The so-called good deal is to force Japan to return to a sensible attitude. Although Germany has signed a commercial agreement with Japan at this time, the raw materials needed by Japan cannot be supplied by Germany at all, so it will have no choice but to conclude a new commercial treaty with the United States, and give the necessary guarantees to the interests that the United States maintains in the Far East, as a condition for exchange." The right-wing "Echo de Paris" published a dispatch from its London correspondent, stating, "The two demands put forward by Japan, (1) the silver deposited by Chinese banks in British and French banks in Tianjin should be handed over to the Japanese side, (2) the paper money issued by banks controlled by the Japanese side in the occupied areas should be recognized, the above two items are actually related to the interests of Britain and France, which is very different from limiting the scope of the original negotiations to the Tianjin incident. In Britain and France, they do not intend to recognize the currency system forcibly implemented by Japan." "Le Temps" reported, "After the initial Anglo-Japanese agreement was reached, only our newspaper expressed disapproval. At that time, we explained two things: (1) Britain could have organized an anti-aggression front in the Far East, and this is confirmed by the current attitude of the United States, which is increasingly credible; (2) Britain's concessions to Japan cannot satisfy its desires, but will only invite new demands and new threats. Regarding this point, the news from the Far East is sufficient to prove it. The British newspapers have also changed their tone. The Tokyo initial agreement may not be respected by Japan, which is almost identical to Germany's disrespect for the Munich Agreement." "Le Republicain" stated, "The anti-British movement in North China is intensifying, and it can be seen that the Japanese side is determined to pursue an anti-British policy. Judging by its attitude, it is hypocritical. As such, it is difficult to conclude a final agreement with Britain. Fortunately, London still has a weapon that has not been used, namely economic sanctions. However, if Japan can purchase goods from the American market one day, then even if Britain implements economic sanctions, it may be detrimental and unprofitable. If the United States can come forward to cooperate, the effect will be significant." "L'Humanité" stated, "For the governments of Britain and France, if they want to pursue a wise and reasonable policy, they should take the warning constituted by the US revocation of the treaty as a starting point, and revive the prestige of the democratic countries in the Far East. Both Britain and France have commercial treaties with Japan, and they can be used as economic weapons to issue warnings to it, or even as a tool for retaliation. This issue is serious in nature and should be discussed jointly by the countries concerned to determine their attitude." (30th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>German-Japanese Commercial Agreement Will Not Affect Sino-German Trade - German Diplomacy is Exhausted - Difficult Progress on the Danzig Issue</h3>
<p>(Berlin) After the conclusion of the German-Japanese commercial agreement, economic circles here have commented that the trade relations between Germany and China will not be affected as a result. This agreement does not apply to the occupied areas of China. As for German credit loans to Japan, they will be handled by a German banking syndicate, which is entirely of a normal commercial nature. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to foreign observers here, German diplomatic policy is gradually becoming exhausted. Since the US government announced the revocation of the US-Japan commercial treaty, the German side has been extremely disappointed. It is difficult to conclude a commercial treaty with Japan to respond, which is not of much significance. Yesterday, Führer Hitler and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop suddenly returned to Berlin, and it was thought that Germany might take some political action, but there was no indication as a result. Generally speaking, the leaders of the Nazi Party originally had this intention, but after careful study, they have already abandoned it. As for the fact that Führer Hitler and other important figures have left the capital for other places, although the German official said that the country is powerful, the government is relaxed and has no worries, in fact, the new developments in the international political situation have made the German authorities feel deeply troubled and have to make excuses to comfort themselves. For example, although Spain has been persuaded by Germany and Italy in many ways, its attitude remains cold. Japan has so far refused to join the German-Italian military alliance treaty. In addition, the anti-German sentiment in the protectorates of Bohemia and Moravia is also increasing day by day. As for the issue of the Free City of Danzig, the leaders of the Nazi Party also believe that Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's insistence that the Free City of Danzig and the Polish Corridor should be unconditionally merged into Germany is too hasty. In short, as a result of the evolution of the current situation, Germany must either resort to war or surrender. If it surrenders, it will be defeated, and the Nazi regime will inevitably suffer a fatal blow. As for declaring surrender, the position of the Nazi government will also be greatly shaken. The future situation is not optimistic. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Saarbrücken Führer Hitler, accompanied by the Commander-in-Chief of the German Army, arrived here yesterday to inspect the Saar defenses. He expressed satisfaction with the new defense works and praised the effectiveness of the special forces protecting the defense line. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop accompanied Hitler. Hitler then returned to Beirut by plane. (30th Haitong News Agency)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times has continued to comment on the US government's abrogation of the Treaty of Commerce and Navigation between the United States and Japan, saying, "As far as German Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini are concerned, this move by the US government can make them understand two facts: first, all provocative actions that harm US interests will be dealt with by the US with strong resolve; second, if such provocative actions continue, the political unity of the United States will be strengthened as a result. It is a pity that the authorities of Germany and Italy have apparently failed to understand these facts due to a misunderstanding of the issue of amending the US Neutrality Act. We can see from the comments made by the newspapers controlled by these countries that German Propaganda Minister Goebbels and Italian government spokesman Gayda have not understood this."

<h3>British Navy, Army and Air Force Prepare for Major Exercises - Home Fleet Concentrates on Scottish Coast - 12,000 Naval Reservists Enlist</h3>
<p>(London) The British Home Fleet's summer leave ended yesterday and has sailed from the south to the Scottish coast. 55,000 local troops have also entered camp. 12,000 naval reservists have been conscripted due to the impending "crisis months" of August and September and will report tomorrow. On the evenings of August 8th and 9th, half of England will conduct the largest air defense exercise since the German Air Force attacked London in May 1918. At that time, all lights will be extinguished, and more than 1,000 aircraft will participate in the air defense exercise. King George will inspect the reserve fleet on August 9th. The fleet will conduct its first joint exercise with the Home Fleet since July 1914. The reserve fleet includes 130 warships. After the 12,000 reservists report, the fleet can set sail within a few hours. (30th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Portsmouth Several warships belonging to the British Home Fleet, including the aircraft carrier "Ark Royal", cruisers "Aurora", "Glasgow", and "Somali", have recently departed from this port for Loch Ewe in northern Scotland to prepare for exercises. However, the flagship, the battleship "Nelson", will remain here for several days before departing.

<h3>Spanish Minister of the Interior Denies Internal Strife</h3>
<p>Burgos Spanish Minister of the Interior Suñer met exclusively with a Reuters correspondent today and stated that there are no rifts in Spanish politics and no internal strife. However, at this time, the new nation is groping forward, and unexpected events may be unavoidable. The case of General Lano (the dismissed commander-in-chief of the Second Military Region) has been resolved simply and smoothly. General Yagüe (commander of the Madrid garrison) has never been arrested and is on very good terms with me. According to recent rumors of internal strife among Spanish government officials, it is said that General Lano was dismissed for making indiscreet remarks during a speech in Seville. Parisian newspapers also reported that General Yagüe was arrested for opposing cooperation with the Axis powers, and that other generals are also out of favor. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

The slogans lamented the lack of bread and called on all Spaniards to prepare for a counter-revolution. (30th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italian Air Force Exercise Completed</h3>

According to an official statement, a total of 480 aircraft participated in the exercise, flying in formation from various bases in Italian Sardinia, North Africa, Libya, the Aegean Sea, and the Province of Friuli in mainland Italy. They were fully loaded with military supplies, and some had a range of up to 1,500 kilometers. Some bombers also conducted night bombing exercises hundreds of kilometers away from their bases. It is said that all aircraft flew a total of 300,000 kilometers in the Mediterranean airspace and never had an accident. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Air Force conducted a large-scale exercise in the central Mediterranean for four days from July 25th to 28th. A total of 408 aircraft from the air force bases of Sardinia, Sicily, Puglia, and Libya participated in the exercise. Yesterday, it was announced in the official gazette that "the exercise was a test of the special tactics of the air force in the high seas, and the result was satisfactory, proving that Italy has built an excellent air force."

<h3>Lloyd George Says Situation is Serious, Never More So Than Today</h3>
<p>(London) Former Prime Minister Lloyd George, leader of the Liberal Party, recently gave a speech in Wales, broadly discussing the international situation. He said, "The international situation is more serious now than at any time since 1914. If you ask me, an old man of seventy-six, why I have not retired to the countryside but still travel around the country giving speeches at political gatherings, my answer is very simple: the international situation is more serious than at any time since 1914. I feel that my duty is not to abandon myself to idleness. I still remember that four years ago, when the League of Nations had not yet collapsed, its 58 members were all behind Britain. But now, only France and Poland have close ties with us. Therefore, it is necessary to try to unite with the Soviet Union. When the Nationalist government first came to power, the national defense budget was £117,000,000, and this year it will reach a huge £800,000,000." This increase in the budget is enough to prove the seriousness of the international situation, and the guarantee that our country has given to Poland is a willingness to provide assistance to that country if it is invaded. But it is impossible to send warships to provide assistance. Therefore, "without obtaining the cooperation of the Soviet Union, how can assistance be implemented? It must be known that the Soviet Union is the strongest land power in the world. We are now negotiating with this friendly country, asking it to come to our aid when necessary. This is not comparable to plotting peace with the enemy. However, Prime Minister Chamberlain would rather go to Germany himself in September last year to meet with Führer Hitler, and visit Rome in January this year to inquire about Mussolini's health and praise him as a good man, but now, in conducting negotiations with the Soviet Union, not only does the Prime Minister not deign to go in person, but even a cabinet member is not sent, but only a secretary of the Foreign Office is sent to Moscow. Is this reasonable? It should be known that at this time Führer Hitler is deploying defenses in the Free City of Danzig, and before the mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union is established, the city of Danzig will belong to Germany. In short, the policies pursued by the current government are all wrong. Even in terms of domestic land production, if war breaks out, domestic land production will inevitably be inferior to that of 1914. The reason for this is that those who call themselves the Nationalist government do not have a deep understanding of the livelihood of the people. The planting of food is also an important part of national defense, no less important than the manufacturing of aircraft and other armaments. In the previous European War, Germany succumbed to food panic, which can serve as a lesson for the future." (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Brief News from Various Countries</h3>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent of "Sunday Dispatch" recently declared that Britain is preparing to be actively involved in diplomacy, urging the countries of the Balkan Peninsula to improve their relations. In addition, after Prince Paul, the Regent of Yugoslavia, recently came to London for an unofficial visit, the British government will grant credit loans to the country and increase its purchases of various products, mainly timber. At the same time, it also plans to grant credit loans to Bulgaria. (29th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw News has recently been received here that the Senate of the Free City of Danzig will issue an order within days to implement compulsory military service to replace the current method, that is, all citizens between the ages of eighteen and twenty are obliged to be conscripted into the police. However, young people in the city who have not served as police officers have already joined various organizations of the Nazi Party, which is actually equivalent to compulsory military service. Therefore, if the Senate issues an order, it will only be recognizing the actual situation. In addition, military supplies from Germany are still being transported to the city of Danzig in a steady stream. Today, another 5,000 tons of gasoline, 2,000 tons of lubricating oil, and a large number of heavy trucks (mostly owned by the former Czech army) were transported to the city.

<p>(Paris) The Council of State decided today to extend the term of office of the members of the current Chamber of Deputies from four years to six years. In this way, the re-election in 1940 will be postponed to 1942. This matter arose from the intention of Prime Minister Daladier, because the government has recently received reports from all sides, learning that the international situation is extremely serious and that it is necessary to be cautious and prepared in order to maintain peace. If necessary, it will fulfill its various obligations without the slightest retreat. Under these circumstances, it is essential that all parties in the country eliminate prejudices, unite, and strengthen national defense. Therefore, it was decided to extend the term of office of the members of the Chamber of Deputies so that the political passion caused by the election campaign can be avoided. (29th Havas)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Repeatedly Bomb, Guilin Begins Evacuation Work - Various Agencies Meet to Formulate Measures</h3>
<p>Guilin Correspondence, since the establishment of the Southwest Military Headquarters, Guilin has suddenly become the center of military and political affairs, its importance in terms of its position no less than Chongqing. Therefore, Japanese aircraft frequently patronize. In the past two months, after the Japanese army suffered repeated defeats in Zhongtiao Mountain in southern Shanxi and Dahong Mountain in northern Hubei, the Japanese army, in order to cover up its military setbacks, took advantage of its air superiority to destroy the materials of important cities in the rear of the Chinese army. Chongqing and Guilin were subjected to inhumane bombing. At the beginning of this month, the Southwest Military Headquarters convened a meeting of military, political, and party authorities in Guangxi Province to discuss air defense measures. They all said that in order to preserve strength, it is necessary to have a precise set of passive air defense plans. Therefore, the Guilin Pacification Commissioner's Office and the Guangxi Provincial Government were ordered to be responsible for the preparation. Subsequently, Cao Qingbiao, Deputy Director of the Military Headquarters, Sun Renlin, Director of the Provincial Government, Chen Gui, Director of the Mobilization Committee, Tang Ji, Deputy Director of the Air Defense Headquarters, Xie Zongkeng, Director of the Pacification Commissioner's Office, Wu Yu, Section Chief, and others jointly met to draft a plan for evacuating the population and materials in Guilin, and urged the relevant agencies, bureaus, groups, and organizations to step up their work.</p>
<p>Evacuation work is planned as follows: (1) It was decided to first evacuate the agencies, schools, and groups in the Guilin urban area. (2) and (3) are confidential. (4) Evacuation areas were designated and locations were assigned for separate transfers. (5) Personnel were assigned to survey the evacuation areas and proceed separately. Cao Qingbiao was dispatched by the Southwest Military Headquarters, Xie Zongkeng was dispatched by the Pacification Commissioner's Office, Sun Renlin was dispatched by the Provincial Government, and Tang Ji was dispatched by the Air Defense Headquarters. (6) The evacuation of all materials from the various agencies and schools shall be based on the evacuation area designated by the original agency. (7) The evacuation of materials from the various mass organizations shall be based on the original designated evacuation area. (8)</p>
<p>The following matters should be noted in each evacuation area: (A) sanitary facilities, (B) transportation facilities, (C) air raid warning, air raid shelter or air raid room facilities, (D) identification and post office box facilities, (E) housing or shed construction facilities, (F) evacuation area market facilities. The above facilities shall be planned and properly handled by the original competent agency. (9) The prices of mud, water, carpentry, and carpentry work required for the construction of each evacuation area shall be determined by the Provincial Government and the Provincial Party Department in consultation with the various trade unions in order to avoid manipulation and hoarding. (10) When surveying the evacuation area, engineering and sanitation personnel should be brought along for design purposes</p>
<p>Various buildings (11) First, the Provincial Police Department is responsible for investigating the exact number of people in the city and the number of agencies, schools, and groups to determine the need for the width of the evacuation area. At the same time, the Air Defense Headquarters is responsible for adjusting the air raid shelters for citizens. (12) After the survey of the evacuation area is completed and locations are assigned, separate evacuation measures will be determined. It is found that the above items were discussed and carried out separately on the 15th. It is heard that at the latest by the end of this month, all agencies, schools, and groups in the city will be able to begin the evacuation work. According to the opinions of various military and political officials, the first step is to evacuate the elderly, the weak, women, and children in the urban area, then the agencies, schools, bureaus, and offices, and then the materials and merchants in the urban area. After all plans are completed, the entire implementation will be carried out.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Shantou, Also Send Planes to Bomb Lufeng Hetian</h3>
<p>Shantou Dispatch: The supreme commander of the Japanese Navy in South China, Kondo Akira, led a fleet to invade Shantou on the 18th. It is reported that his sole purpose is (1) to intensify the blockade of the Chinese coast, cutting off China's overseas supply lines; (2) to establish a military base in Shantou, echoing the Japanese troops in Chaoshan and Dongguan Shilong, and forming an outer encirclement of Hong Kong, cutting off Sino-British commercial and economic relations. On the morning of that day, six Japanese warships and twelve aircraft, covered by more than twenty speedboats, bombarded and bombed Magong, launching an invasion. The Chinese military and civilians calmly fought back, sinking two Japanese boats and killing or wounding dozens of Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese troops retreated to their ships. However, thirty shops and houses in Shantou city were destroyed by bombing. On the same day, two Japanese planes flew from Shenquan sea area, under the jurisdiction of Huilai County, into Lufeng Hetian and dropped three bombs. Two bombs landed on the main street, and one bomb landed on Fish Street, collapsing eight houses and killing or wounding more than ten civilians. The planes then flew over Daan, Dawu, Fenhe, Hepo, and Jieyang areas for reconnaissance. On the 20th, more than ten seaplanes flew to the eighteen villages near Shantou for reconnaissance, bombing and strafing the people with machine guns in Magong, Xiayang, Dongchong, Zhuyuan, and Lun. In Honghai Bay, seven or eight Japanese warships were anchored, covering four or five hundred marines, who took more than seventy speedboats and rubber boats and rushed into Xingang. The Chinese military and civilians rose up to resist, repelling the landing Japanese troops twice. At 10:00 AM, the Chinese army's cover was bombed and destroyed, and Shantou city was struck by forty or fifty bombs, turning it into scorched earth. The army then retreated with pain to Miwei, a small hill about twenty-five *li* from Shantou, which is a necessary passage to Haifeng City. The highway bridges along the way had been destroyed by the Chinese army in advance, so the Japanese armored vehicles and engineering corps could not operate. In the evening, the Japanese troops reached the vicinity of Miwei with their morale already weakened. The Japanese troops invading Shantou landed in several places. On the same day, four or five Japanese electric boats were sunk by the Chinese army, killing or wounding more than two hundred people. Finally, one thousand soldiers who landed were attacked by the Chinese army stationed in Chaijin, Huiyang, on the 21st, under orders to prevent the Japanese army from advancing further.</p>
<p>In the Chaoshan area, the Chinese army once again rushed into Chaoan City on the evening of the 19th, besieging Jinshan and Hulu Mountains. The Japanese troops in the city were quite empty because they had been transferred to Chenghai City and Shantou. The battle on Zhugao Mountain and Hulu Mountain was extremely fierce. The Japanese army even used poison gas bombs. The Chinese military and civilians were unable to prevent it, and more than one hundred people died from poisoning. The Chinese army on Anjie Road occupied Fuyang, Gezhou, Yunbu, and Jinshi, defeating the Japanese army and seizing many tanks, cannons, ammunition, and weapons. At present, there are only four Japanese warships in Shantou. In the sea area outside Mayukou and near Chaoyang and Tatou Mountain, the Japanese army has laid mines to prevent foreign ships from entering Shantou.</p>
<h3>Fujian Authorities Actively Seek Ways to Evacuate Overseas Chinese Families, Relieve Refugee Overseas Chinese, Send Personnel to Comfort and Investigate Living Conditions</h3>
<p>The Fujian provincial authorities, considering that the families of overseas Chinese mostly live in coastal areas and rely solely on remittances from Nanyang to maintain their livelihoods, realize that their difficulties are more serious than those of the general public at a time when the Japanese are blockading the ports. Therefore, evacuating overseas Chinese families and relieving refugee overseas Chinese is a matter of great urgency. Thus, last month, the Fourth Section of the Provincial Government sent a letter to various overseas Chinese associations, requesting them to immediately provide their opinions on the above issues for reference. Recently, the Fuqing Overseas Chinese Association replied in a letter: "After investigation, the number of overseas Chinese in our county is very large, and most of their families are in China. In this time of tension and serious situation, our association pays great attention to the safety of overseas Chinese families. We have sent personnel to various coastal towns to advise overseas Chinese to evacuate women and children as much as possible to ensure their safety. We have also sent our chairman, Zai Xiangzi, to various hometown associations in Nanyang to promote the government's policies and seek funds to actively support overseas Chinese families. As for relief, we have convened rice merchants and wealthy overseas Chinese to organize a food adjustment committee, raising funds to purchase large quantities of rice and storing it in safe areas, implementing price controls to prevent unscrupulous merchants from hoarding. Furthermore, our association believes that the responsibility of relieving wartime refugee overseas Chinese is heavy and that a sound organization is essential to cope with it. We have held a meeting and decided to establish a refugee overseas Chinese relief committee." It is reported that the Provincial Government has deeply appreciated the above opinions, and it is also reported that the overseas Chinese associations of various counties are also paying close attention to the evacuation of overseas Chinese families and the relief of refugee overseas Chinese and have successively started preparations in accordance with the organization of their counties. The purpose of the association is to provide relief to overseas Chinese families who are victims of the war and cannot be evacuated.</p>
<p>The source of relief funds is from donations from overseas Chinese from various Nanyang territories. In addition to the Standing Committee, the organization is divided into seven sections: Accounting, Documentation, Evaluation, Fundraising, Investigation, Relief, and Audit. It is also reported that the association holds two meetings every month to handle routine matters and holds meetings at any time when necessary. With this relief organization in the county, overseas Chinese families who are victims of the war and cannot be evacuated can all find a place to live, allowing overseas Chinese struggling overseas to avoid worries about their families. It is also reported that the Provincial Government, for the sake of comforting overseas Chinese families and providing relief, will send those who are familiar with the situation of overseas Chinese in southern Fujian</p>
<p>to guide everything. Provincial Councilor Lin Qingshan was sent to Dehua and Yongchun areas to comfort overseas Chinese families, investigate their living conditions, and discuss relief measures for refugee overseas Chinese. From this, we can see the government's attention to evacuating overseas Chinese families and relieving refugee overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Commemorating a Sincere Friend of China: Dr. Han Ninghao</h3>
<p>— Qu Liang</p>
<p>Religion and education complement each other and are interlinked. Without education, reason cannot be fully developed, and the difference between humans and animals is negligible. Without religion, the treasures of the spirit lack the possibility of inspiration, life is controlled by instinct, and one cannot step into the threshold of transcendence. Bishop Han Ninghao has devoted himself to religious and educational undertakings for nearly half a century. What has passed has been transformed, what remains is divine. His influence is profound. His power to gently guide and inspire people is so great that one can imagine his own profound attainments. Dr. Han's spiritual life is indeed deeply hidden, and we have no way of knowing it. However, his rich life, presented before our eyes, is always the bits and pieces of his inner life and its expression. We might as well do a brief study.</p>
<p>Han Ninghao was born in 1862 in Men, Westphalia, Germany, and died in 1939 as the Bishop of Yanzhou, Shandong. Although he lived only seventy-seven years, he spent as many as fifty-three years in China, including thirty-two years as a bishop. He was proficient in Chinese language and spoke the Shandong dialect fluently. If you only heard his voice and did not see him, you would definitely think that he was a Shandong "fellow villager" speaking to you, and you would not hear a trace of a foreigner's accent. He spoke Mandarin with great style and was a natural speaker. Moreover, he wrote Chinese very well. His book "Questions and Answers Explained" has been popular in China and has recently been printed in its twelfth edition. He understood the situation in China, understood Chinese culture, appreciated the psychology of the Chinese people, and deeply felt the lovableness of China and the Chinese people. Years ago, he returned to Europe on official business. In a hurry, he returned to China. When people asked him why, he said, "I want to die among the Chinese people." He was afraid of dying in Europe and not being able to return to his homeland.</p>
<p>Dr. Han Ninghao was not only a religious figure but also a scholar. He had a very deep foundation in early literary education. Therefore, he was able to delve into the roots of Greek and Latin literature. After joining the Society of the Divine Word, he carefully studied theology and was ordained as a priest in 1885. Later, he studied philosophy and natural science at two universities, Engzig and Penler, before coming to China to preach. From this, it can be seen that his academic attainments were very deep and that he was able to grasp and have a very deep understanding of modern knowledge and trends of thought. Therefore, his speeches and writings were very correct and appropriate, and they were well received by the German people. Therefore, the Mingxing German Academy of Sinology invited him as a special honorary member to reward his contributions to religion and culture.</p>
<p>Over the years, Shandong has been plagued by natural disasters and man-made disasters. Under the pressure of floods, fires, and wars, people have been unable to live. Bishop Han has repeatedly exhausted all his possessions and done his best to save the poor and displaced, truly practicing loving others as himself. The Sino-Japanese War has lasted for more than two years, and countless people have spent their tragic and helpless lives in the flames of war and on the road of exile. I commemorate Dr. Han Ninghao here because he was a religious figure, an educator, and especially a complete person. At the same time, I also want to awaken the sympathy of righteous Germans for China. (End)</p>
<h3>Training Financial Personnel</h3>
<p>Continuing to Recruit Third Term Students; Lishui Also Can Apply</p>
<p>Lishui Dispatch: The Ministry of Finance, in order to comply with the regulations of the Program of Armed Resistance and National Reconstruction regarding the reform of financial administration and to standardize the appointment of financial personnel, established a Financial Personnel Training Institute. The director of the institute is concurrently held by the Minister of Finance. Previously, it had recruited and trained financial personnel for a total of two terms, who were assigned to various places for employment.

Furthermore, Director Zhang Sen of the office will, in accordance with regulations, hire many experts to organize an examination committee to be responsible for handling the examination.</p>
<h3>Typhoon Hits Xinghua, Damage to Seedlings</h3>
<p>Yuhua Dispatch: At around 12 o'clock on the night of the 23rd of this month, a hurricane suddenly arose, and houses and reed sheds in various places along the river were blown down. Then, there was heavy rain for an hour. Rice seedlings that had flowered but not yet fruited were broken off, and the harvest loss would be significant. The next day, various villages attached to the city reported disasters.</p>
<h3>Nantong Yuxi: Puppet Police Chief Shot</h3>
<p>Nantong Dispatch: More than thirty Japanese troops are stationed in Yuxi. Because of their weak strength, they recruited more than ten puppet police officers on the spot, with Cao Nai as the puppet head. On the evening of the 22nd of this month, Cao and his friend went to the Ri Xin Pond to bathe. While dozing on a chair, three strong men suddenly attacked Cao with box guns. Cao was shot three times, and blood and flesh flew everywhere. Seeing that their goal had been achieved, the strong men left with a roar.</p>

<h3>Japanese Troops Erect Obstacles on the Eastern Section of North Jiangxi Road; Rumors Say This Move Is to Delimit Defense Zones; Residents Are Moving Out, Situation Is Very Tense</h3>
<p>North Jiangxi Road, starting from the northern end of the Waterworks Bridge in the south and ending at the old shooting range road to the east end of a row of shops and houses, as well as alleys, has been suddenly blocked by the Japanese side since more than 3:00 PM the day before yesterday. According to the reporter's new observations from yesterday's patrol, the Japanese side is using wooden poles and barbed wire to block the eastern end of the road, causing many shops to be surrounded and unable to operate. However, at several intersections such as the intersection of North Jiangxi Road and Tiantong Road, the intersection of Qipu Road, the intersection of Jiaojianshi Road, and the intersection of Haining Road, there are gaps in the barbed wire blockade at the eastern end, allowing shops and residents in the area to enter and exit, and to move freely without the need for passes. However, it is obvious that these gaps will be blocked again in a few days. At that time, residents living in the area who want to enter the central area of the concession will need the same procedures as those living in Hongkou, resulting in many moving vehicles parked on North Jiangxi Road. Those moving from the blocked area to the concession are constantly increasing. It is said that some shops near the Iron Horse Road Small Vegetable Market, located at the eastern end of North Jiangxi Road, have been doing well in business on weekdays. Once blocked, the losses in their business are difficult to describe. At each gap on the road, there are Japanese soldiers on guard, and the situation is quite tense.</p>
<p>The Incident of Conflict Between British and Japanese Soldiers</p>
<p>The *North China Daily News* reported that yesterday (the 29th) in the afternoon, four British soldiers from the West Yorkshire Regiment, traveling in a truck, went to a lane next to North Jiangxi Road to remove the barbed wire obstacles erected by the Japanese army during the 1937 war in the Japanese defense zone. When they were replacing it with new barbed wire, they were surrounded and detained by the Japanese marines and were unable to return to North Jiangxi Road. The time was 3:45 PM, and the situation was very tense. At 7:00 PM, the four British soldiers and the truck were released and returned to their own defense zone.</p>
<p>After the British soldiers were detained, 250 Japanese marines, carrying wooden stakes and barbed wire, arrived at the scene. Some Japanese sentries stationed themselves in the middle of North Jiangxi Road, which is in the British military zone, to protect other Japanese soldiers removing the British-placed wire mesh on the east side of North Jiangxi Road and replacing it with Japanese barbed wire obstacles. They also forced the few West Yorkshire British soldiers to withdraw from their defense houses on the east side of North Jiangxi Road near the firing range and sealed off the houses. These British soldiers stood on the west side of Peng Road and watched. However, when the Japanese sentries had completely withdrawn last night, American soldiers cut off the obstacles erected by the Japanese soldiers and re-entered their defense houses. When the Japanese soldiers erected obstacles as high as six feet in the British defense zone on the east side of the road, thousands of Chinese residents living east of North Jiangxi Road were quite alarmed and carried boxes and baskets into the British defense zone. At the same time, Japanese sentries with guns and bayonets stationed themselves on the center of North Jiangxi Road, five yards inside the British defense zone. Although they did not prevent the Chinese from leaving the Hongkou district east of the road, at least one Japanese sentry slapped an elderly Chinese woman who was passing by on the cheek. Yesterday's incident seems to confirm that the British soldiers were in the wrong because the British defense zone extends to the east side of North Jiangxi Road, and the sidewalk on the east side is the western end of the Japanese defense zone. However, in the past, little attention has been paid to this point. The barbed wire obstacles built by the British army the year before last can still be seen on Peng Road and Wuchang Road, ten yards west of North Jiangxi Road. The four British soldiers thought that the Japanese army would not object to their entering the Japanese defense zone to replace the new obstacles in the middle, so they went to work in the lane. British and Japanese military officers and police officers began consultations on Wuchang Road in the Japanese defense zone around 6:00 PM. It was then heard that although the Japanese soldiers had not yet removed the obstacles they had erected, they had retreated to their defense zone. However, all parties believed that the matter had been resolved, and the Japanese soldiers would remove the obstacles in the late night or this morning (30th) and return to their defense zone. In recent weeks,</p>
<p>rumors have been rampant that the Japanese soldiers intend to completely erect obstacles on North Jiangxi Road and have built defense houses in various locations, requiring Chinese residents in the area to register. However, the British soldiers have still been able to live in the defense houses in the Japanese defense zone on the east side of the road, indicating that the Japanese authorities do not object to the British soldiers stationing there until yesterday. The British soldiers had only erected barbed wire between Bazi Road and Haining Road so that the Chinese could freely enter the Xihongkou area. However, yesterday, the Japanese soldiers erected obstacles throughout North Jiangxi Road all the way to the Suzhou River, leaving only small gaps at each intersection to allow pedestrians to pass through. While the officers were conducting consultations, several truckloads of armed Japanese marines were stationed behind them waiting for orders. However, after the Japanese soldiers erected the obstacles in the evening, there were no other actions. Early this morning, Chinese residents continued to withdraw in droves. However, after yesterday evening, the Japanese sentries had withdrawn, and by 10:00 PM, there were no Japanese marines to be seen in the vicinity. At the same time, the West Yorkshire British soldiers divided</p>
<p>into two groups, cut off the Japanese soldiers' obstacles, and re-entered the defense houses near Bazi Road and the bottom floor of the telephone company building at the corner of North Jiangxi Road and Haining Road. Late last night, there were few people to be seen on the streets east of North Jiangxi Road, while the west side was as bustling as a hive. The Japanese soldiers' obstacles extended to Tiantong Road. There were rumors that the Japanese soldiers' obstacles near the post office headquarters had already been</p>
<p>removed by the Japanese soldiers and that the Japanese soldiers would electrify the barbed wire. However, there was no sign to confirm these rumors late yesterday night. According to a Japanese naval spokesperson last night, the Japanese soldiers erected obstacles in order to delimit the defense zone boundaries and are preparing to investigate all residents in the Marine Corps defense zone starting from August 1.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Subsidiary Coin Panic, Expected to Be Thoroughly Resolved; 500,000 Subsidiary Coin Notes Printed in Hong Kong; Lead Coins Also Being Minted by Bank of China</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance approved the request of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and ordered the Issuing Bureau of the Central Bank to issue 1-cent and 5-cent subsidiary coin notes to circulate in Shanghai to regulate the situation, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency obtained reliable information from the Central Bank yesterday regarding the issuance of 1-cent and 5-cent subsidiary coin notes. The bank has signed a printing contract with the Hong Kong Yongning Printing Company, totaling 300,000 yuan for 1-cent notes and 200,000 yuan for 5-cent notes, for a total of 500,000 yuan. According to the contract, delivery will be made within 20 days from the date of signing the contract, and they will be issued by the Central Bank. The bank, considering that the 1-cent notes are inconvenient to count and easily damaged, plans to issue "aluminum" coins, also in 1-cent and 5-cent denominations. It has also actively consulted with the Ministry of Finance to proceed. The cost of the aluminum coins is quite expensive, similar to the tokens of the former Shanghai China General Omnibus Company. The decision to first issue 500,000 yuan in subsidiary coin notes is a temporary relief measure during the transition period, and aluminum coins will be issued in the future. Regarding the 500,000 yuan in subsidiary coin notes, they are expected to be shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai by mid-August and officially issued.</p>
<h3>Uniform Public Bond Principal and Interest Payments to Begin Today; Bank of China Receives Official Notice from Headquarters; Shanghai to Handle Discount Payments in Six Installments</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance suspended the payment of principal and interest on various bonds guaranteed by customs duties due to the interception of customs duties, the National Debt Fund Management Committee, in order to maintain credit and stabilize the market, consulted with the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank to agree to discount and pay the uniform principal and interest due at the end of the month. The Shanghai branches of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Communications Bank have now received notice from their headquarters that they are authorized to handle discount payments starting today. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Installment Discount Method</p>
<p>After the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank discounted and paid the uniform public bond seventh installment principal and interest due at the end of July, the four banks and the National Debt Fund Management Committee agreed on a discount method, stipulating that Shanghai will pay it off in six installments, each lasting one month. The "discount certificates" and installment payment forms have all been printed, stipulating the amount to be received per installment based on the certificate. If there is a fraction of less than one cent in Shanghai, it should be included in the sixth installment for combined calculation. The discount certificate is based on the account name, with one form filled out per household, and the five types of bonds (A, B, C, D, and E) do not need to be listed separately.</p>
<p>Official Notice from Headquarters Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the Central Bank was closed as usual. The reporter from the New Voice News Agency paid a special visit to a deputy director at his private residence. According to him, the principal and interest of the uniform public bond due at the end of this month will be discounted and paid by the Central Bank, Bank of China, Communications Bank, and Farmers Bank. However, Shanghai will handle it in six installments, paying with remittances. The paying agencies are the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Communications Bank. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has now received notice from its headquarters that it is authorized to start payments on the 31st, and all procedures are ready. The discount is the result of the National Debt Fund Management Committee consulting with the four banks and reaching an agreement.</p>
<p>Eighth Principal Repayment Lottery Date</p>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee has determined the lottery date for the eighth principal repayment of the uniform public bond: (1) Type A, August 10, 25 winning numbers will be drawn, repaying 3.75 million yuan; (2) Type B, September 10, 10 winning numbers will be drawn, repaying 1.5 million yuan; (3) Type C, October 9, 8 winning numbers will be drawn, repaying 2.8 million yuan; (4) Type D, November 10, 8 winning numbers will be drawn, repaying 4.4 million yuan; (5) Type E, December 9, 8 winning numbers will be drawn, repaying 2.08 million yuan. The payment date is January 31 of next year.</p>
<p>Maintaining Credit Always Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's policy of maintaining credit remains unchanged. After the war, the central bank overdrawn the accounts for payments, totaling over 17 million yuan, which is enough to prove the government's determination to maintain credit. As for the notice on January 15 to stop financing overdrafts, it is a common sense of world affairs, explaining that "when the customs duties of the war zones that have already been deposited and owed are submitted to the General Customs Department in accordance with the old regulations, the funds for debt compensation will still be allocated," so this measure has been deeply understood by both Chinese and foreigners. The Ministry of Finance does not oppose the decision of the four banks to handle uniform public bond discounting.</p>
<h3>Compatriots from Gaogiao, Baoshan Repair Sea Dikes; Typhoon Direction Changed Yesterday Afternoon; Gale Warning Signal Hoisted Outside Wusong Port</h3>
<p>The sea dikes of Baoshan and Gaogiao outside Wusong Port have been out of repair since the war. Although the compatriots' associations managed to repair them last autumn, the project was so large that it was not easy to raise funds. Therefore, only the collapsed embankments were filled in, which was inevitably crude and simple. Although it was hoped to consolidate them, the dikes were attacked during the first typhoon this year, causing more collapses. Fortunately, it is not yet the peak tide season in autumn, so there was no danger. In order to prevent floods, the Shanghai Pudong and Baoshan Compatriots' Associations are carrying out repairs to the collapsing embankments to avoid danger in the coming autumn.</p>
<p>Second Typhoon Direction Changes</p>
<p>The two new typhoons that originated in the Pacific Ocean on the 26th have been declared: The first typhoon has been extinguished. According to the report from the Xujiahui Observatory at 2:00 PM yesterday, the typhoon is still at 131 degrees east longitude and 24 degrees north latitude. According to yesterday morning's report, its direction was north-northeast, staying southeast of the Ryukyu Islands without change. By the 2:00 PM report, the direction had changed from north-northeast to northwest and was advancing, but the speed was very slow. The wind range was 120 nautical miles, 600 nautical miles from Shanghai. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the typhoon's future path.</p>
<p>Wind Signal Flags Added in Wusong</p>
<p>In order to facilitate ships outside Wusong Port, the Jianghai Customs Port Authority Director Tebek has temporarily issued Gale Warning Signal flags to indicate wind conditions in Wusong in the Sixth Bulletin, stating: "The regulations of the Ranlu Signal Station on indicating typhoons and wind conditions were announced in the eighth bulletin of this department on August 24, 1932. Now, in order to facilitate ships anchoring outside Wusong Port, it is specifically stipulated that the same wind signal flags will be hoisted on the Wusong large wind signal mast or on the flagpole on the top of the Wusong Quarantine Sub-station near the Wusong Lighthouse. If there are any changes in the future, they will be announced by this station. Only one or two black balls will be hoisted temporarily at the above signal locations during the daytime. All merchants and sailors are hereby notified. This bulletin is specially issued."</p>
<h3>京滬車遭襲擊　橫林附近地雷轟炸鐵軌四濺　機車貨車出軌交通昨已停頓</h3>
<p>Mainland newspapers report that guerrillas fighting along the Shanghai-Nanjing railway line launched another attack near Wuxi around 7:00 AM yesterday (the 29th), using machine guns to strafe a mixed passenger and freight train and blowing up several sections of the track. The locomotive and eight freight cars were derailed. While the number of casualties is unknown, it is reported that several passengers were killed and some injured. Several Japanese railway guards also died. A Japanese military spokesperson acknowledged the attack yesterday in response to inquiries, stating that this was the third successful attack on the Shanghai-Nanjing line by guerrillas since February of last year. The mixed passenger and freight train was attacked by about 400 guerrillas yesterday morning at 7:00 AM between Changzhou and Wuxi. The bombing occurred 300 meters from a bridge. Although the bridge was unharmed, several sections of the track were destroyed, and the locomotive and several freight cars were derailed.</p>
<p>The train was carrying farmers and goods. It was ambushed by guerrillas shortly after leaving Changzhou. The spokesperson said in response to another question that there were no Japanese soldiers on the train other than the train guards. Details of casualties are unknown. However, it is reported from other sources that the train was strafed with machine guns, resulting in deaths and injuries. This was one result of the attack. The</p>
<p>Shanghai-Nanjing express train that departed from the North Station yesterday morning returned last night. Because the Shanghai station did not receive the news, the Shanghai-Nanjing express train departed as scheduled at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. Upon reaching the scene of the incident, Japanese soldiers ordered the driver to drive the train back to Shanghai. According to a passenger on that express train, heavy machine gun and rifle fire could still be heard when the train arrived at the scene. They did not know the exact nature of the incident, nor were they</p>
<p>allowed to leave the train, only hearing that the track had been destroyed. However, due to the gunfire nearby, they believed that the guerrillas were involved. Furthermore, the news agency reported that a train derailment occurred between Changzhou and Wuxi on the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway on the morning of the 29th. The incident occurred at 7:00 AM when a train of 3rd and 4th class carriages, Train No. 10, traveling from Nanjing to Shanghai,</p>
<p>reached a section 350 meters west of Bridge No. 6185 between Henglin Station and Luoshe Station in Wujin. A landmine pre-positioned there by guerrillas was triggered with a deafening explosion, sending sleepers flying and rails scattering. The locomotive and the eight freight cars in front immediately derailed and overturned. At that time, the guerrillas who had been lying in ambush there,</p>
<p>numbering about three hundred, immediately surrounded the train and opened fire. After receiving the news, Japanese troops stationed in Changzhou rushed to the rescue, but the guerrillas had already retreated. At the same time, the Shanghai Railway Bureau also immediately dispatched an ambulance and vehicles loaded with sleepers. However, due to the extensive damage, it was not easy to repair immediately, resulting in the suspension of traffic on the Shanghai-Nanjing line yesterday. It is reported that many passengers were injured in this incident.</p>

<h3>法幣準備充足　中外一致擁護　現金準備較各國為高　發行新滬幣難成事實</h3>
<p>With the Ministry of Finance's determination to maintain the value of the legal tender (fapi), the issuance of fapi is particularly cautious, and reserves remain adequate. As of the end of June this year, the total amount of fapi issued by the four banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) was 2,626,929,300 yuan. Cash reserves (including gold, silver, and foreign exchange) accounted for more than 44% of the total issuance. Although slightly lower than before, it is higher than in most countries in the world.</p>
<p>Since the implementation of the fapi policy, domestic and foreign individuals have found it convenient. The banknotes previously issued by foreign banks have been gradually withdrawn and are now nowhere to be found on the market. The statutory foreign exchange policy of the Central Bank of China remains unchanged. To date, the British exchange rate remains at one shilling and two and a half pence, and the US exchange rate remains at 30 US dollars. It is now heard that some people are suggesting that the authorities in the concession issue a new Shanghai currency. Although it has not been confirmed whether this news is true, it is important to know that</p>
<p>Chinese fapi is the only currency of China recognized by all countries. Shanghai is a part of China. Legal currency should be used within China, and new currencies should not be issued separately, thereby undermining</p>
<p>the currency system and hindering the circulation of fapi. Domestic and foreign individuals who seek to develop trade should all maintain the fapi so that the foundation of the fapi becomes increasingly consolidated.</p>
<h3>徐家匯　聖母院育嬰工作</h3>
<p>— Chen Zhengfan</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Orphanage of the Holy Mother was established in 1869 as a magnificent structure of Catholicism in Shanghai. It has made many outstanding achievements in infant care, which is worthy of our attention and praise. Because of my investigation of childcare, I visited and studied the orphanage's infant care situation. I have written down an outline of it as follows:</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Orphanage of the Holy Mother was established in the eighth year of the reign of Emperor Tongzhi of the late Qing Dynasty (1869 AD), and has a history of seventy years to date (Note 1). Its founder was Father Xue Kongzhao of the Catholic Church. Thanks to the resolute talent of the first director, Mother Duominwu, and her thirty years of long-term efforts (Note 2), the orphanage is booming and has the grand scale of today. The hospital is now divided into an infant care center, kindergarten, school for the deaf and dumb, Qiming Girls' School, Christmas Girls' School, Xuhui Girls' Middle School, medical clinic, laundry, embroidery shop, lace room, sewing workshop and other departments. The current director is Dai Bu Xian President (President of the Rescue Association), and those in charge of infant care affairs are Mother Augustine.</p>
<p>All affairs of the Holy Mother's Hospital are now handled separately by the Sisters of the Rescue Society (more than 150) and the Virgins of the Dedication Society (more than 20), completely on the basis of sacrifice and service, without receiving any compensation. As for those serving in the infant care center, there are 12 Mothers, 14 teachers, and more than 30 nannies and workers.</p>
<p>The Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care accepts helpless infants from birth to five years old. Since its establishment, it has accepted more than 25,000 infants. There are currently 650 infants. It is said that after the August 13th Incident, an average of 3,000 infants are admitted each year. In the past, 22 infants would be admitted on one day, and 80 infants would be admitted in one week, which was common and not an exception.</p>
<p>The Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care has considerable and complete medical equipment. At the same time, all the Mothers have rich medical knowledge (Note 3), and the famous doctor He Lizhong is often responsible for his voluntary work, so he can accommodate as many sick infants as possible and give them appropriate and timely treatment. According to the person in charge of the hospital, other infant care centers in Shanghai (such as Renji Infant Care Center) also send sick infants to the hospital for treatment and accommodation. In order to provide infants with fresh and clean milk, the Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care has specially raised 24 dairy cows. Dairy milk is milked daily by specialized technicians and disinfected. This is not only a pioneering initiative in the childcare industry in Shanghai, but also rare in China.</p>
<p>Male infants in the Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care are fostered in Catholic families after they are one year old, and the hospital provides a subsidy of four to nine yuan per month. On the first day of each month, the foster families must bring the infants to the hospital, where they are examined by the person in charge. If any improper treatment is found, they will be explicitly pointed out and strictly ordered to make improvements.</p>
<p>The Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care follows the policy of assuming full responsibility for the entire life (material and spiritual) of each infant admitted, attempting to cultivate and educate the infant into adulthood, teach him/her skills, and assist in choosing a spouse to establish a devout and happy family. Based on this unique policy, the hospital has no intention of adopting or imitating the common adoption system used by ordinary infant care centers.</p>
<p>Infants in the Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care receive kindergarten education from the age of six, learning to read, listen, play, sing, etc. every day.

<p>Infants at the Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care who are growing up are sent to the Tushanwan Orphanage to continue their studies when they are six years old. Girls who are six years old are taught elementary school courses and are instructed to learn sewing (a required subject), embroidery, lace, weaving, and other household work.</p>
<p>When girls at the Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care grow up to be adults, the hospital will help them choose a spouse and establish a family. According to the hospital's rules, those who enter the hospital are dedicated to Catholicism and can only marry Catholic men. The heads of the hospital believe that only orphans can deeply love orphans, so they strive to help adult orphans from the hospital marry adult orphans from the Tushanwan Orphanage to seek permanent and reliable happiness. If the orphans are willing to work after marriage, the hospital will be responsible for arranging work for them (embroidery, lace, weaving, etc.); otherwise, the orphans and the hospital will maintain close contact and emotional harmony forever, just like biological mothers and daughters.</p>
<p>Because the Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care has its own houses, raises dairy cows, and the staff are sacrificial, the average monthly cost for each infant is only eight yuan. This is very different from other infant care institutions. (According to Renji Infant Care Center, the average monthly cost per orphan is 21 yuan, and the average monthly cost per child in the Shanghai War Zone Infant Shelter is 19.2 yuan).</p>
<p>The Holy Mother's Hospital for Infant Care relies on donations from Chinese and foreign believers and the surplus from various production projects organized by the hospital. The hospital's leaders never solicit donations from the public because there is no need to do so.</p>
<p>(Note 1) Father Xue Kongzhao founded the Holy Mother's Hospital in Hengtang, Qingpu in the fifth year of Xianfeng of the late Qing Dynasty (1855), moved to Wangjiatang in the third year of Tongzhi (1864), and moved to Xujiahui in the eighth year of Tongzhi (1869). If the history of the Xujiahui Holy Mother's Hospital is calculated along with its predecessor, it has a history of 84 years.</p>
<p>(Note 2) Mother Duominwu was a French national who preached in China for a total of 56 years and devoted 30 years to the planning and management of the Holy Mother's Hospital.</p>
<p>(Note 3) The Mothers of the Catholic Church have medical and nursing knowledge. They not only preach but also heal people's suffering. After the foreign exchange was tightened, the price of coal balls increased again and again due to rising raw material costs and high costs. The price per ton was 52 yuan to 56 yuan. The retail price of the same goods also varied by three to four corners. The highest price was 3.23 yuan per tan, and the lowest price was 2.67 yuan per tan. The quantities were also inconsistent. The situation was chaotic and can be said to have reached its extreme. It is reported that the Shanghai Machine-Made Coal Ball Industry Association has issued a notice on the retail price of coal balls from August 1 in order to unify the market price, stipulating that the retail price of each 100 city catties of national currency is 3 yuan, and no arbitrary increases or decreases are allowed. At present, the source of domestic coal has disappeared. All of it depends on the supply of foreign coal in Shanghai. It is said that Indian coal is the most popular. Although the price of coal is high, the source is still smooth. Indian coal has been shipped in large quantities in recent days. The city's inventory is sufficient, and there is no shortage of fuel. The selling price is expected to gradually stabilize, but since foreign exchange has been repeatedly reduced, the price of foreign coal has risen accordingly. After each ton has increased by more than 10 yuan, the Japanese side has taken the opportunity to ship coal from Shandong and other places to Shanghai for mixed sales. The selling price is more than 10 yuan lower than that of foreign coal, and sales are very smooth. It is rumored that the Japanese side will ship large quantities of coal from North China and other places to Shanghai for dumping in order to seize the market.</p>
<h3>米糧堆棧徹查　嚴懲囤戶操縱　米業今開聯席會議　蕪米開禁早稻出新</h3>
<p>There will be a thorough investigation of rice warehouses, and severe punishment for hoarders and manipulators. The rice industry will hold a joint meeting today, the ban on Wuhu rice will be lifted, and early rice will be released.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Association, in view of the rising rice prices in Shanghai, which is related to the livelihood of ordinary people, in order to find ways to adjust the sources and stabilize market prices, because this matter is of great importance, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve results if carried out alone, so it has specially invited the Shanghai Rice Business Association, the Rice Milling Industry Association, the Rice Grain Sales Association, the Changshu Rice Industry Office, the Nanbang Office, and the Rice Transportation Merchants United Association. And other seven groups held a joint meeting. The original letter is recorded as follows: Dear Sir/Madam, Our Association is scheduled to hold a joint meeting at 4:00 pm on the 31st of this month (Monday) on the second floor of the Grain Exchange on Avenue Edward VII to invite representatives of various rice industry groups in the city to discuss important matters. It is hoped that your (association) (office) will send representatives to attend the meeting at that time.</p>
<h3>執行限價　徹查囤積</h3>
<p>Enforce price limits and thoroughly investigate hoarding</p>
<p>In addition to strictly enforcing food rice price limits and making every effort to dredge up the source of domestic rice, the concession authorities will thoroughly investigate the number of rice stored in each rice warehouse and the names of the owners, and have already begun a thorough investigation. There are 77 warehouses, 9 belonging to the French Concession and 68 belonging to the International Settlement. All the warehouses that have been investigated shall be certified by the investigators. If it is found that someone is hoarding privately for huge profits, they will be severely punished and ordered to be sold below the price limit. In addition, citizens are allowed to report incidents that exceed the price limit in order to investigate and deal with them.</p>
<h3>通知應查　米糧堆棧</h3>
<p>Notice of rice warehouses to be investigated is as follows: Bank of China, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Bank of Communications, Shanghai First, Shanghai Second, Jiangsu Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, New China Bank, China One Trust, Zikang, Local Bank, China Real Bank, Donglai Bank, Wan Shen Xing, Hengfeng, Longmao, Yucheng, Shengji, Yongsheng, Taikang, Hefeng Yuan, Zhengfeng, Dafeng Chang, Deda, Dayouyu, Deherun, Gongji, Runji, Dade Xin, Xin Yu, Shenghe Long, Xian Mao, Hengda, Lianyi, Dade Xin Nan, Jutai He, Jiangnan, Heng Xing Yi, Yi Xing Feng Nan, Yi Xing Feng Dong, Jiuda, Wan Chang, Xinye, Pinghe, Wan Sen Sheng, Zhang Xieji, Qiada, Datong, Wan Sheng Tai, Xie Chang De, Yuan Mao, Tong Shen, Mao Tai, An Shen Er, An Shen San, Taikoo, Roosevelt, Chang Yi Heng, Ding Tai De, Xie Da, Guang He, Hu Feng, Xin Yuan, Ding Yu, Yuantong, Ding Yu, Huang Changsheng, Ding He, Heji, Heng Xin Shun, Tong Sheng Heng, Heng Xing Gong, Deng Rentai, Yuelai, Daxing, Wan Tai Xiang,</p>
<h3>東新登塲　蕪湖弛禁</h3>
<p>Dongxin rice has entered the market, and the ban on Wuhu rice has been lifted.</p>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency reporter's interview with Fu Qian Geng, Director of the Market Management Committee, the Pudong new japonica rice has entered the market, with an annual output of 30,000 to 50,000 shih. Sample rice has arrived in Shanghai and is of excellent quality. It will be shipped to Shanghai in batches. As for the Yangjian rice in Jiaxing, it will be on the market soon, but sample rice has not yet arrived in Shanghai. Regarding the ban on rice from Wuhu, it is heard that those who hold old removal permits can still ship it out of the country. It is said that new removal permits will be issued on August 1, and a "export tax" of 20 cents per tan will be added. Secondly, the ban on rice and grains from Wuxi, Changshu, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Pinghu and other places is also more relaxed than before, and they can be transported and sold to Shanghai through transit.</p>
<h3>華董主張　嚴懲操縱</h3>
<p>Chinese directors advocate severe punishment for manipulation</p>
<p>Regarding the price limit on rice and grains, the authorities previously invited representatives of rice merchants to agree on a maximum rice price of 21 yuan per shih, and stipulated that the price should be gradually reduced every week according to market conditions by one yuan per turn. Therefore, after the rice price in the city was lowered to the maximum price limit of 20 yuan two weeks ago, it was originally planned to find a way to change it to 19 yuan. Unexpectedly, the foreign exchange tightening incident occurred, and a group of speculative hoarders took the opportunity to manipulate the price, causing the rice price to rise again and almost reach 23 yuan in the dark market. Fortunately, it was stabilized thanks to the proper control of the authorities. It is now learned that all Chinese directors of the Public Works Department, namely Yu Qiaqia, Yuan Ludeng, in view of the soaring rice prices, which has a great impact on people's food, the reason for this surge is obviously the manipulation of shuttle hoarders, in order to suppress market prices and stabilize people's livelihood, they advocate that speculative hoarders and rice merchants who raise prices should be severely punished, so as to punish one hundred, and the future of the rice market can be expected to be stable.</p>

<p>German Jews come to China with concrete plans. Person in charge, Berglas, said that immigration agencies will provide economic assistance.</p>
<p>According to the Mainland Daily, Berglas, who was in charge of discussing the matter of German Jews immigrating to China two months ago, issued a statement yesterday (29th) stating that the central government and the Yunnan Provincial Government are prepared to allow 100,000 German Jewish immigrants to enter China under certain circumstances, with the right to reside and work, enjoy government protection, and have the rights and obligations of Chinese citizens. Jewish refugees must bring sufficient funds to cover the cost of food and accommodation for one year, estimated at 50 pounds sterling per person, which will be allocated as follows: 14 pounds for one year's food, 12 pounds for building houses, and the remaining 14 pounds for start-up capital. The organizing committee of the world's leading immigration agencies has also established a cooperative bank to handle accommodation and business issues in the first one or two years according to the planned economic model, and to provide immigrants with special training in physical and intellectual education. After one or two years, they should be self-sufficient. However, this plan is purely economic and has no political nature, which will benefit China and all parties involved.</p>

<h3>百老匯大廈內賭場　停業敬告　日海軍發言人　咋巳發表聲明</h3>
<p>The casino in the Broadway Mansion is closed for business. The Japanese Navy spokesperson issued a statement yesterday.</p>
<p>According to the Mainland Daily, the Japanese Navy spokesperson told reporters last night (29th) that the casino named "Temple", which opened on the 18th floor of the Broadway Mansion last week, was warned to close on Friday night. The Mainland Daily published this news on Tuesday. That night, the Japanese Navy spokesperson claimed that the authorities "did not know" about the casino. If there was one, it would have been ordered to close. According to the Mainland Daily on Tuesday, the casino was operated by an American and three White Russian Jews. After this news was published, the Mainland Daily editorial department received an anonymous phone call. The person spoke with an American accent and contained threats. He asked who belonged to this manuscript. He wanted to know the name of the reporter of this manuscript in order to provide information about the casino.</p>
<h3>夫妻仳離後　婦忽請求廢約　前日傳審諭令退候核辦</h3>
<p>After the couple divorced, the woman suddenly requested the revocation of the contract. The trial on the previous day ordered the case to be returned for review.</p>
<p>Xiao Junhou, a graduate of Fudan University, had an unusually harmonious relationship with his wife, Zhang Qin, after they were married, because they both had considerable knowledge. They had been married for several years and had one child each. It can be said that it was a happy marriage. However, on January 15 of this year, they both went to lawyer Zhang Danping to ask him to certify the divorce agreement that they had already negotiated on their own. Zhang, who did not know either party, asked them if they had no objections to the divorce terms after seeing the unexpected parties, and then went through the procedures for certification and publication. However, only ten days later, Zhang Qin suddenly visited Zhang alone, saying that the previous incident was suddenly forced by her husband, and she could not agree to it. Since then, the existence or abolition of the divorce contract has become the focus of the dispute between the two parties. It has been several months and has not been resolved. Recently, Zhang Qin filed a lawsuit against Xiao Junhou in the First Special District District Court, requesting the cancellation of the contract. The head of the civil court, Li Hu, held a hearing on the previous day. Neither of the original defendants appeared in court. Only lawyer Zhang, who was the certified person of the contract, appeared in court in accordance with the summons. After describing the circumstances of the certification for both parties on that day, the court ordered the case to be returned for review.</p>
<h3>某方卡車肇禍　撞斃老嫗</h3>
<p>A foreign truck caused an accident and killed an old woman.</p>
<p>Liu Xu, an old woman from Hubei, was fifty-two years old this year and lived at No. 36 Zhoujia Lane, Pudong. She made a living as a vegetable vendor. Yesterday morning, she sold a load of cowpeas. She crossed the Huangpu River to Shanghai. She landed at around seven o'clock, carrying her load on her shoulder, and then went to the small vegetable market on Fourth Ma Road to sell them. In front of No. 107 Avenue Edward VII, she was crossing the road from south to north, walking to the center of the south half of the road. A truck No. 20366, driven by a foreigner, was speeding from east to west. Old woman Liu could not avoid it and was knocked down, injuring her head. The truck continued to drive straight ahead. It was seen by Russian constables at No. 119, who rushed forward to chase the truck and was finally caught and brought to the police station to report the situation. On the one hand, the police sent Liu to Renji Hospital, but she died of her injuries. The police were notified to send the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch mortuary to be examined. The Second Special District Court will be requested to send personnel to inspect the body today. The driver of the accident truck was reportedly escorted by the police to the consular office in Shanghai under the jurisdiction of the case for investigation.</p>
<h3>生活艱難　路有棄孩</h3>
<p>Life is difficult and children are abandoned on the road.</p>
<p>In these extraordinary times, with serious national crises, combined with foreign exchange shortages and soaring gold prices, everything is expensive, causing ordinary people to feel the pressure of life and the pain of hardship. Recently, some lower-class people have given birth to children and felt unable to raise them, so they abandon their children everywhere. The police have found them and sent them to charitable organizations for adoption. This has been seen many times in the newspapers. The other day, a blue cloth package was found on the side of Rue Grosse in the French Concession, containing a female infant who had been born for more than ten days. She was crying loudly. The police saw her and took her to the police station. The Second Special District Court was asked to arrange for her. The judge ruled that she should be sent to a charitable organization for foster care. Also, recently, there have been girls aged three or four to five or six who have gotten lost. The police have seen them, taken them to the police station, and transferred them to the Second Special District Court for instructions. They have all been ruled to be sent to charitable organizations for foster care pending collection. When the reporter asked the girls, they said that they were out playing with their families and got separated and lost. However, there are very few family members who report to the police station asking for an investigation. It is speculated that the reason for this is also that they are too poor to make a living, so they are abandoned on the road. The situation is very pitiful.</p>

<h3>National Physician Qi Linsheng Accused of Indecent Assault Case, Judge Reassigned for New Trial, Witness Testifies All Fabricated False Accusations</h3>
<p>A Suzhou woman, Chen Wangshi, residing at No. 1 Wufeng Lane, at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Rue Lubin, previously appointed lawyer Hu Yongsheng as her representative, filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, accusing Qi Linsheng, a Henan national physician who runs a business in Yongyu Lane, Route Lafayette, of enticing her 19-year-old daughter, Chen Sanyuan, on October 7th of last year,</p>
<p>Leaving Home</p>
<p>Hiding and sexually assaulting her at No. 522 Rue Péreire until April 12th of this year, when she was finally found on the street and brought back. She requested Qi to be punished for crimes such as disrupting family ethics. The case was previously concluded by Judge Liao Yuan, but because the judge was reassigned to the Civil Court, the conclusion of the debate was revoked. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Until yesterday, Judge Sun Pengxian opened the Criminal Court</p>
<p>For a New Trial</p>
<p>Both parties and their lawyers were present. Chen Wangshi and Chen Sanyuan successively testified about the above-mentioned events. When questioned, the defendant Qi Linsheng denied the indecent assault. Then, witness Zhang Shucheng testified that the defendant was his friend and that the plaintiff was initially introduced to the defendant by him to prescribe medicine to quit opium. This was entirely a fabricated fact with the intention of extortion. He also said that her mother ran a brothel and her</p>
<p>Daughter a Prostitute</p>
<p>The co-tenant He Gongdu also knew about it. At this point, the plaintiff's lawyer immediately stated that the witness's insults to the plaintiff were excessive and requested the clerk to record it for a separate lawsuit. After verifying the statements, the court ordered that the co-tenant He Gongdu be summoned to court for questioning and rescheduled the trial for August 2nd. The defendant was released on the original bail.</p>
<h3>Refugee Lottery Committee Scheduled to Host Press</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Charity Lottery Committee is organized by enthusiastic people from friendly nations with the aim of relieving refugees. It has the same nature as other charitable organizations. The Lottery Committee, in view of the fact that the previous lottery sales system involved multiple intermediaries, resulting in huge expenses and inability to sell smoothly, has now directly commissioned Fengxing Company to handle it. It is learned that Mr. Ou Nong, the general manager of the company, has been in charge of charitable causes such as floods, droughts, and military disasters in various provinces for more than ten years and has considerable experience. Since the start of the August 13th Shanghai Battle, he has assisted Father Jacquinot in handling relief work in the Nanshi refugee area and has made remarkable achievements and is admired by all walks of life. This decision to take over the lottery business is bound to be optimistic for the future of promotion. Also, the Western name of the association is Lotovie de Bienfaisance pour Les Refugies S.A. The official Chinese translation is the Refugee Relief Lottery Committee. The current lottery tickets have already been printed and cannot be changed. The official translation will be used for all future issues. The association, fearing misunderstandings from all sectors of society, plans to periodically invite the press and lottery merchants in the city, hosted by Father Jacquinot and others, within the month to report on the distribution of relief funds and the process of distributing them to various shelters, so that all sectors can understand the truth and facilitate sales for the benefit of refugees. It is heard that Mr. Blancart, the transport chief of the International Red Cross, has come to Shanghai from the United States to help Chinese refugees. He has contacted overseas Chinese in the Philippines and Indonesia along the way to promote refugee lotteries. The overseas Chinese there are enthusiastically subscribing because it concerns the relief of fellow refugees. It is expected that the sales of this issue will exceed previous records.</p>

<h3>Chen Dongyuan, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, Talks About How to Choose Departments and Schools Government Limits Liberal Arts to Reorganize Them Any Subject Can Lead to Success as Long as It Is Studied Well</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) Chen Dongyuan, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, published an article on how young people should choose departments and schools when applying to schools. The content is very concise. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Principles Discussion</p>
<p>Young people who want to go to school must choose schools and departments when applying to schools, and their choices generally have certain principles. Unfortunately, the principles commonly used may not be very reasonable and are worth discussing. For example, (1) the principle of national needs. This is a very common principle. Every young person applying to school has the idea of ​​serving the country. In today's lack of talent, this is also very appropriate. However, it is very difficult to say what kind of talent the country needs and what kind of talent the country does not need. There are eight different colleges in universities: liberal arts, science, law, agriculture, engineering, commerce, medicine, and teacher training. None of them are not needed by the country. Hu Shih is known to everyone. When he went to the United States to study, he was determined to study agriculture because agriculture is a practical subject and China is still an agricultural country. Studying agriculture well can practically save the country. Who knew that after studying for two years, he felt that it was not close to his nature, so he changed from agriculture, a very practical subject, to philosophy, the most theoretical subject in liberal arts. When he changed departments, he wrote a poem containing the line "Saving the country in everything, what can't be done." Sure enough, after returning to China, he used his philosophical cultivation to launch the cultural movement of the May Fourth period, which greatly awakened China's ideological circles. This is enough to prove that literature can also save the country, and its influence is even greater than that of practical subjects. The needs of the country are very complex with thousands of threads. Any academic skill is needed. In the past ten years, the government has had a policy of restricting liberal arts and law, so some people think that liberal arts and law are not worth studying. However, after carefully studying the government's intention to restrict liberal arts and law, it does not mean that it will no longer train talents in liberal arts and law. It is only because the establishment of liberal arts and law does not necessarily require how to equip them. A group of universities filled with incompetent people simply opened courses casually, and because no experiments are required, the number of students admitted at all levels is one or two times more than in science and engineering, so it is inevitable to produce rough and shoddy products and reduce the degree. Therefore, the government came out to restrict them. In other words, it is actually reorganizing them, hoping that the liberal arts and law schools left behind by various schools will be enriched and can create real talents to meet the needs of the country. Since the Anti-Japanese War, everyone has thought that the need for engineering will definitely increase in the construction of the country, so last year, in the unified enrollment, 33.9% of the students applied to the engineering college. The number of students who applied to the aeronautical engineering department was the largest, which is enough to prove the young people's enthusiasm for serving the country, but this view is not very correct. If all young people want to study engineering, thinking that it is the way to save the country, then all cultural undertakings, social work, and political work other than engineering will have to stop. Agriculture and commerce cannot be improved either. How can the country be built then? Therefore, I think that the principle of choosing departments based on the needs of the country is very good, but it can only be used as a higher ideal. In fact, at least in the next 20 years, the country needs all kinds of talents. (2) The principle of personal career prospects. This is a more common principle. Every student applying to school is considering which subject will have broader career prospects after graduation. The number of people applying to the aeronautical engineering department was the largest last year, which is also the reason. Studying is originally to put knowledge into use, so this is also very appropriate. However, this reason is not absolutely correct. In countries where various industries are on track, the relationship between studying and career prospects is indeed closer. For example, the United States is like this. Railways and highways have already been built in all directions. It is simply not easy for students graduating from civil engineering to find jobs. Other subjects that you want to study are also worth paying attention to the social needs. Which talents are insufficient and which are surplus, but in China, a new country that is starting to build, everything is waiting to be done, and the needs are huge. There are no accurate statistics on existing talents, and there are no detailed plans for future careers. It is simply impossible to determine the differences in the needs of various subjects. If you ask which subject has good career prospects, I think it is better to ask you whether you can study any subject well. Any subject, as long as you study it really well, has career prospects. Engineering, agriculture, commerce, and medicine are indeed professions. Literature and philosophy can also be used as professions. Law, politics, and education are even more so. They are all professions, and they are all needed by the current society. The only thing to fear is not studying well. As the old Chinese saying goes, "Every profession produces an expert." This sentence still has merit to this day.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council's Expenditure on Chinese Education Over the Past Eight Years Totals Over 1.487 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has always attached great importance to Chinese education. It is true that Chinese education has been promoted and developed rapidly in the past ten years. The number of high schools and junior high schools established in the concession area has increased year by year. Therefore, in addition to the original Chinese primary schools established by the bureau, the bureau also provides a large amount of funding each year to subsidize the education expenses of private Chinese schools. The amount of funding increases according to the situation of the school's request. The reporter recently investigated at the Education Department of the Municipal Council. From 1932 to 1939, in the past eight years, the Municipal Council has subsidized Chinese school expenses totaling 1,487,425 yuan.</p>

<h3>United States Abrogates Trade Treaty with Japan, Japan and Germany Establish Trade Treaty</h3>
<p>— Bao Le Di</p>
<p>In Tokyo negotiations, the United States abruptly abrogated the U.S.-Japan Commercial and Navigation Treaty established in 1911. This move did not occur during the U.S. Congressional discussion of this case this spring, but is now being implemented while the Anglo-Japanese so-called Tokyo negotiations are underway, revealing its political significance. As soon as this news spread, the Tokyo negotiations immediately stalled. Even without the U.S. abrogation, the Tokyo negotiations were inevitably doomed to fail; but the halt after the U.S. ripped up the U.S.-Japan trade treaty shows that the alignment of democratic countries on the Far East issue has not changed in the slightest due to Britain accepting the Tokyo negotiations. This is where the political significance of the U.S. abrogation of the trade treaty with Japan lies.</p>
<p>However, from an economic point of view, the consequences of the U.S. abrogating the trade treaty with Japan may be more severe than the blow it has given Japan on the international diplomatic stage.</p>
<p>First, from the perspective of the interests of the national economies of the two countries in their trade relations: Needless to say, Japan's main objectives in foreign trade, apart from obtaining raw materials and absorbing excess commodities from other countries in foreign markets, now include a more important objective, which is to obtain foreign exchange to purchase military supplies. Although Japan's trade with the United States has consistently been in deficit, the trade volume accounts for the top spot in its so-called "trade with third countries." Maintaining the main raw materials and tools for its export industries and military industries almost entirely relies on the United States. Before the war, large quantities of U.S. cotton, timber, and machine tools were imported; now, large quantities of U.S. steel, machinery, oil, copper, etc. are imported. Today, more than 90% of Japan's absolutely essential military raw materials and equipment rely on the United States, including copper and automobiles; more than 60% rely on the United States, including various fuels; and about 42% to 50% rely on the United States, including machinery and pig iron. Therefore, Japan must maintain its export market in the United States and maintain its purchase of military supplies from the United States and the necessary raw materials for export industries. Trade with the United States accounts for an absolute majority of Japan's "trade with third countries." Japan's trade volume with the five major powers of the United States, Britain, France, Germany, and Italy (unit: million Japanese yen)</p>
<p>(Note) Figures are cumulative for January to April of this year</p>
<p>This clearly points out that U.S.-Japan trade is not only the economic foundation for Japan's invasion of China, but also the condition for maintaining its entire national economy. Therefore, renowned journalist Gernway believed that "the invasion of China is the baby of the United States." Without U.S. supplies, Japan simply cannot invade China. Moreover, many experts have pointed out that the biggest shortcoming in Japan's industrial equipment is that it mostly uses American machinery. This highly mechanized production equipment requires even a single screw to be purchased from the original manufacturer. If the United States were to stop supplying, Japan's industrial activities could grind to a halt.</p>
<p>The second point to note: the trade of the three major democratic countries, Britain, the United States, and France, accounts for almost all of Japan's foreign trade. Its so-called German and Italian allies cannot provide any assistance to Japan's war economy or national economy, especially since they themselves rely on supplies from Britain, the United States, and others. Therefore, the U.S.'s sudden abrogation of the trade treaty with Japan has greatly shocked the Japanese government and public. Not only Japan, but also the German and Italian governments and public. This is why the Japanese-German trade treaty, which has been negotiated for almost two years, was able to be concluded so quickly. However, as shown in the table above, the trade relationship between Japan and Germany is really insignificant. Although Tokyo and Berlin believe that signing the German-Japanese trade treaty is a response to the U.S. abrogation of the U.S.-Japanese trade treaty, it is really too pathetic.</p>
<p>Negotiations for the Japanese-German trade treaty began in Berlin as early as last spring. At that time, Japan attempted to complete a joint Japanese-Manchurian treaty with Germany, but because the conflicts of interest in trade relations between Germany and Manchuria were not as severe as those in German-Japanese trade, the German-Manchurian trade treaty was established separately and was formally signed last September. Negotiations for the Japanese-German trade treaty have not been close ever since.</p>
<p>The first trade agreement between Japan and Manchuria was in April 1936. This was the initial performance of the anti-communist axis composed of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Economically, it was only because Japan attempted to use the export of special products from Northeast China to maintain its domestic purchasing power for Germany. Last year's plan to sign an integrated Japanese-Manchurian treaty with Germany had only this effect. Because Japan hoped to offset its own trade deficit with Germany with the trade surplus of Northeast China, it naturally hoped that Germany's exports to Manchuria would be as small as possible. This is one of the fundamental reasons for the conflicts of interest in trade between Germany and Japan.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Germany's exports to Manchuria are mostly daily industrial products and low-grade machinery that are in surplus in Germany; Japan hopes that Germany will import mainly military supplies, which are products that Germany itself has insufficient supply of. Of course, it is unwilling to supply others. This difference in the needs of trade products also determined the fate that trade between Germany and Japan is not easy to reconcile. At the same time, it is also the reason why the German-Manchurian trade treaty was finally established first and existed separately. We should also understand this German-Manchurian trade treaty.</p>
<p>The main content of the first German-Manchurian trade agreement was to stipulate that the annual trade volume between Germany and Manchuria should be 100 million Japanese yen. However, Germany only needs to pay three-quarters (75 million Japanese yen) of the foreign exchange in cash to Manchuria for imports from Manchuria; the remaining one-quarter (25 million Japanese yen) only needs to be recorded under Germany's debt to the Yokohama Specie Bank, which is offset by Germany's trade surplus with Japan.</p>
<p>In terms of Northeast China's export capacity, this total trade volume of 100 million Japanese yen only restricts Manchuria's exports to Germany and does not provide any benefits. However, in order to achieve its political conspiracy, Japan did not hesitate to sacrifice Manchuria's industries to sign the agreement. Manchurian exporters naturally opposed it, and Japanese importers also unanimously opposed it. Because restricting the trade volume of Northeast China means restricting the possibility of Northeast China's trade surplus, which also reduces the possibility of Japanese importers using the foreign exchange obtained from the Northeast China trade surplus to purchase goods from Germany. Therefore, in the new agreement established last autumn, Japan and Manchuria unanimously requested to expand the trade volume. Germany, due to the urgent need for internal demand, had strict restrictions on exports; therefore, it reluctantly agreed to expand the trade volume between Japan and Manchuria to 163 million Japanese yen. Since June of last year, Manchuria has greatly increased its exports to Germany in order to meet Japan's need for foreign exchange, and Germany has also tried to reduce its trade deficit with Manchuria and has also greatly increased its exports to Manchuria (which is actually Japan's disguised import). However, there is no room for adjustment in the trade relationship between Japan and Germany. Because Germany's required imports from Manchuria are limited to raw materials such as soybeans, soybean oil, and peanuts, and Japan's required imports are textiles, silk fabrics, aquatic products, and toys. These needs all have certain limits in Germany. However, Japan and Manchuria's required imports from Germany are machines, iron pots, and chemical products, which are also in extreme need in Germany itself and cannot be exported indefinitely. On the contrary, Germany has requested that Japan not restrict the import of surplus products such as cameras and medicines and maintain the import records before the war, but in Japan, which is suffering from a foreign exchange panic, these are regarded as unnecessary and non-urgent products and are strictly restricted from import. In addition, as a result of Japan's war against China, there is a large shortage of domestic labor, and general industrial activities are overwhelmed by military industry. Therefore, not only has production been drastically reduced, but exports related to military needs are also uniformly restricted. For this reason, while trade between Japan and Manchuria has勉强 increased, trade between Japan and Germany has plummeted. The trade contradictions caused by this fundamental conflict not only have not improved at all, but are becoming increasingly worse. Take a look at the table below to see the details (unit: 1,000 Japanese yen)</p>
<p>(Note) The first year is from June 1936 to May 1937, when the first German-Manchurian trade agreement was established; the second year is from June 1937 to May 1938, and the third year is from June 1938 to April 1939.</p>
<p>The fundamental relationship between the trade of Germany and Japan is already so opposed; not to mention that the conflicts of interest between Germany and Japan in the Chinese market are even more difficult to bridge. Since their interests are not easy to reconcile with each other, even if they are reconciled, their relationship in Japan's war economy and even national economy is still too small to enumerate. Therefore, the hasty signing of the new agreement this time will definitely end in failure, and its effect will be at most to slightly strengthen its momentum. However, the "momentum" reflected in this small trade record only makes people feel more pathetic.</p>
<h3>Regarding My Speech</h3>
<p>— Yao Qingsan</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The most precious strength of a nation at war is unity of spirit. Has the spirit of all circles in Shanghai remained consistent from beginning to end? The public opinion circles bear a responsibility of rigorous oversight.</p>
<p>In the past week, all the economists staying in Shanghai unanimously sighed about the events revealed in the bi-monthly Economic Review published last Monday. It is understood that the target of the review seems to be Mr. Yao Qingsan, which is especially concerning because Mr. Yao is one of the outstanding economists in the country. The editor is one of them, and also a friend of Mr. Yao. Reading that rigorous and righteous review, I felt even more distressed.</p>
<p>However, after the editor read Mr. Yao's original manuscript of the speech, the heavy burden in my heart was relieved. However, everyone is still eager to read Mr. Yao's original manuscript of the speech to understand the truth; and Mr. Yao is even more willing to make his original manuscript of the speech public to prove the brightness of his position and to dispel doubts. Because the Economic Review could not be published immediately, Mr. Yao handed over a summary of the speech (because the original manuscript was more than 10,000 words long, and the position of this journal could not be fully published) to this journal for publication. I believe it will be welcomed by readers.</p>
<p>However, the editor personally has a few thoughts on this matter:</p>
<p>First: The most important thing in academic research is that the attitude must be pure, and the position must not allow any divergence. As for the inconsistency of academic ideas, this is unavoidable. What Mr. Yao talked about here is quite different from my humble opinion. Who is right and who is wrong? Only the judgment of historical facts has the most power.</p>
<p>Second: Freedom of speech should be promoted, but one should not avoid treatment for one's faults; but it must also be considered in terms of time and space; otherwise, it will not only easily cause misunderstandings, but also lead to bad consequences; however, this is often difficult for scholars who are bookish in nature. Therefore, the supervision of the public opinion circles is by no means superfluous, and it is absolutely necessary. But it must also strive to prevent unfortunate misunderstandings from occurring. If there is a misunderstanding, it should strive to eliminate it and avoid causing division.</p>
<p>Third: This event, in Shanghai Ecouomist and even among intellectuals, has the "rectification" significance of being the first of its kind. And it takes the nation's most outstanding scholars as the target; the relationship is very serious; the nature is perhaps completely different from ordinary debates. But the result is gratifying: because the solemn spirit of Shanghai's Ecouomist group has not been lost, but has been further emphasized because of this.</p>
<p>Fourth: Academic debate is indeed a necessary process for elucidating the truth. However, in Shanghai during this extraordinary period and environment, it is best to avoid its occurrence. In view of the Economic Review's editor's explanation that they had long considered the two letters from readers they received, and asked experts to study them; the seriousness of the attitude is conceivable. And when Mr. Yao made this summary of his speech, it was just after reading that review; it can also be said to be a period of being wronged; the bad mood is naturally in mind, but the writing still restrains his emotions, and in addition to publishing the main points of his speech, he does not adopt a debate method to defend his theory. It can be seen that both sides can care about the overall situation and do not engage in emotional disputes, so a cloud of doubt will surely disappear with the publication of this article. There is often the criticism of "scholars despising each other" in the world, but it has now proved that it no longer exists. This is indeed a great progress in the atmosphere of China's academic circles, or perhaps an extraordinary harvest under an extraordinary environment? (Zhang Yifan)</p>
<p>Two months ago, I was invited to give a speech at the Political Science Association of Soochow University and by President Hu Wenyao and Sun Ruihuang, who had read the original manuscript of the speech, and by the Law School of Aurora University. Unexpectedly, after a lapse of time, Mr. Tang Wenkai and Zhang Yifan made arrangements. It was originally unnecessary to spend words on corrections, but I was deeply afraid of causing misunderstandings from all parties, so I still published the manuscript of the speech at that time in summary to clarify the truth. This article is based on "Readers' Letters," but I absolutely cannot admit the various points mentioned in the "Readers' Letters."</p>
<p>(1) My lectures at Soochow and Aurora Universities were purely academic discussions, and their content was the opposite of what was described in the "Readers' Letters." At the very least, this can be confirmed by Professor Zhang Sumin, who invited me to lecture at Soochow, and the current Mr. Tang, Mr. Wenkai, and Mr. Zhang Yifan at Aurora University. Moreover, the arguments were entirely focused on economics, and absolutely did not involve politics. I made a solemn statement at the beginning of the lecture, and I have never had any relationship with politics, so I have no opinion on political issues at all.</p>
<p>(2) The Population Issue and the "Manchuria" Issue. My conclusion on the population issues of China and Japan is that while Japan does have a problem of overpopulation, China's overpopulation is even more serious. Japan wants to use "Manchuria" as an emigration destination, but "Manchuria" is Chinese territory and also China's lifeline. As for the solution to the "Manchuria" issue, according to strict logic, there are only three ways: (1) China naturally hopes to recover its lost territory, (2) Japan wants to turn it into a Japanese colony, (3) A compromise plan similar to the Lytton Investigation Team of the League of Nations. As for how it will be resolved, since the issue is beyond the realm of economics and concerns national policy, how dare I express any opinions.</p>
<p>(3) The Yen Bloc Issue. I have always been skeptical of the "Yen Bloc." For detailed opinions, please refer to my recent article "From the Sterling Bloc to the Yen Bloc" published in the "Financial Review." I have also given speeches on this issue at Jiaotong University, Jinan University, and Daxia University, with records from the students of each university as proof.</p>
<p>(4) Freedom and Control. Regarding post-war economic construction, given the necessity of using foreign capital, I advocate adopting a more liberal policy and do not approve of an absolute control policy. There is an original theoretical basis, and it goes without saying that any country should adopt a strict planned economy during wartime.</p>
<p>(5) Industry and Agriculture. I believe that industrialization is a solution to China's population problem. Only in this way can the living standards of the Chinese people be expected to improve. Any force that attempts to suppress China's industrialization will be resolutely opposed by the Chinese people. However, because China's economic structure is still dominated by agriculture, in the immediate future, China should accelerate the process of industrialization, but in fact, agriculture will still occupy an important position temporarily.</p>
<p>(6) Trade Issues. Free trade and protectionist trade have long been a contentious issue among economists in the West. I advocate that China should adopt a more liberal trade policy after the war to facilitate the import of necessities and the export of local products. Furthermore, the relatively free trade policy I advocate refers to all friendly countries and is based on equal and reciprocal trade agreements. Such opinions were originally individual freedom of thought and have nothing to do with political issues. Moreover, except for Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, in recent years, it has almost become a unanimous demand of economists in European and American democracies—including socialist economists—who believe it is an important step in solving the world's economic problems.</p>
<p>(7) Investment Issues. Utilizing foreign capital was originally one of the national policies. The Central Political Conference had a decision on three principles. As for opening up the interior, it must be conditional on all countries abandoning extraterritoriality and foreigners truly abiding by Chinese laws (in fact, the National Government had the same provisions in the new treaties signed with Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Portugal, and Spain in 1928). Furthermore, if all countries can abandon extraterritoriality, and foreigners can truly abide by Chinese laws, although China can open up the interior, according to the established rules of civilized countries, the following rights should still be reserved: (1) Immigration Control Rights, (2) Agricultural Land Rights, (3) Transportation Rights, (4) Public Utility Rights, (5) Mining Rights, (6) Fishing Rights, (7) Munitions Manufacturing Rights, (8) Other Special Industry Control Rights. My above opinions were originally based entirely on the conventions of international treaties. Although it is not the time to discuss them, it is not impossible to conduct academic research on them. It is regrettable that the reviewer did not observe this and misunderstood.</p>
<p>The above are the truths of my lectures at Soochow and Aurora Universities, and what I want to disclose is these truths only. As for other words that are used as excuses to make an issue, facts speak louder than words, so why should I say more? Scholarship and morality are the most precious, and emotional words are not what I want to say!</p>
<h3>The Future of the Japanese Economy</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ms. Feng Meiqi</p>
<p>Japan's Economic Outlook by T.A. Bisson Froeign Poliy Report Vol. XV, No. 7 Jun. 15, 1939.</p>
<p>The recent developments in Xiamen and Shanghai show that the attitude of the great powers towards Japan's aggression in the Far East has become tougher. When the Japanese army occupied the Gulangyu concession, the navies of the British, American, and French cruisers landed on May 17th and 18th to protect it. The United States also sent a note to Japan, strongly protesting the Japanese demands for administrative power in the Shanghai concession. Over the past eight months, Japan's attacks on European and American interests have continued to increase; from the occupation of Guangzhou and Hainan Island to the attacks on concessions, it has now reached its peak.</p>
<p>As the European crisis is approaching, the actions of the Japanese are becoming more important. Although their strength is still sufficient to influence the two major forces in the world, it has been greatly reduced compared to two years ago. The scope of its actions has been limited by China's protracted war. During the First World War, the Japanese were able to act freely in the Far East and seize the interests of Europe and the United States. Today it is not the same. What the Japanese can obtain will depend on their military, political, and economic achievements in China, and their domestic economic strength.</p>
<p>Although the Japanese have achieved some military victories in China, they are not true victories for Japan. After the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident in 1937, the war soon spread throughout the country, and there is no end in sight. Guerrillas in the occupied areas are quite active. The regular army under the leadership of Chiang Kai-shek has never wavered. As the war has expanded, it has become more difficult for the Japanese to defeat the main force of the Chinese army, and the retreat of the Chinese army to the interior is becoming more and more unfavorable to the Japanese.</p>
<p>Before a thorough military solution is achieved, the Japanese can only achieve partial political and economic success in China. Even the Japanese are unwilling to formally recognize the puppet governments they have repeatedly established. Economic development can only proceed smoothly after political stability is achieved. Now that the Japanese have not yet won, if a Second World War breaks out, it will inevitably be greatly hindered by the prolongation of the war in China.</p>
<p>The impact of the war on Japan's economy and finance is difficult to estimate. When the Japanese Diet passed the military budget in the summer of 1937, it believed that the war would end and peace talks would be held after the fall of Shanghai and Nanjing. The result was not realized. Later, the Japanese Diet passed an unprecedented huge military budget. The huge amount of military supplies imported has also put serious pressure on Japanese commerce and exchange rates. If war breaks out and Japan is opposed to the Western democracies, its import and export markets will inevitably be cut off, and the result will undoubtedly aggravate the domestic economic crisis.</p>
<p>Japan's Domestic Economy</p>
<p>Under the pressure of wartime needs, several complex problems have arisen in Japan's domestic economy: the expansion of the budget has increased taxes, domestic debt has also increased unprecedentedly, the increase in paper money issuance has affected currency stability, and prices have also risen considerably. Japan's ability to avoid the threat of inflation depends entirely on its ability to increase agricultural and industrial production to meet the huge wartime financial needs.</p>
<p>Table (1) shows the increase in Japan's financial burden since the outbreak of the war. The budgets for 1931 to 1933 were based on the Miseits government's "inflation relief" policy. Most of its expenses came from taxes and other income, and borrowing accounted for a small number. The budgets for the next five years were drafted by Minister of Finance Takahashi. The amount of borrowing has increased, but has never exceeded 75.3 million yen. Commerce has been quite prosperous during these five years, and the increase in government spending has allowed idle labor and capital to be fully utilized. Normal tax revenues continued to increase, and a business profit tax was re-imposed from 1935 to 1936, earning 2.6 million in that year and 4.2 million in the following year. At that time, the national debt increased from 61.88 million to 105.75 million, an increase of 43.87 million, or 70 percent.</p>
<p>The last three years of the budget in Table (2) are in sharp contrast to the Japanese finance in the Takahashi era. The figures for 1937 to 1938 include half a year of war expenses. The following two years include the full year's war budget. The expenses for 1939 to 1940 are almost double those before the outbreak of the war. The borrowings for 1938 to 1939 and 1939 to 1940 are almost double those for 1936 to 1937. The increase in taxes is equally significant. Tax revenues increase by about half a trillion every three years. The estimate for 1939 to 1940 is 153.2 million yen, an increase of 150 percent compared to the year before the war. In that year, in addition to increasing taxes, it was still necessary to issue 565.2 million yen in public bonds to make up for the budget deficit.</p>
<p>How to issue this huge amount of public bonds without affecting its economic operations is an important issue for Japan's wartime finance. The actual public bonds sold are often lower than the budget estimates. Public bonds issued in the 1937 to 1938 fiscal year totaled 22.30 million yen. Public bonds issued in the 1938 to 1939 fiscal year, to February 1939, totaled 43.00 million yen. The budget for the first eighteen months after the outbreak of the war should have issued 89.4 million yen in public bonds, but only 65.4 million yen were actually sold.</p>
<p>The difficulty in selling public bonds can be seen in the increase in the amount held by the Bank of Japan. The numbers held in the past three years are shown in Table (2). The second item is the amount of public bonds that the bank has undertaken but not digested. The Oriental Economic Journal said: "In 1938, public bonds were issued for 43.50 million yen, while the Bank of Japan's holdings increased by more than 50 million yen. That is, 15.7 percent were not digested, and the situation does not seem to be optimistic." In addition to national borrowing, private groups needed to borrow 40.00 million yen in 1938. Although national savings reached 80.00 million yen in 1938, they were not enough to fully consume the government's public bonds. And the increase in production is extremely small, then the increase in national savings may be due to the depreciation of the currency value, and the previous savings are also part of it (to be continued).</p>

<h3>Disguised Foreign Currency</h3>
<p>— Mu Weng</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper's local news reported: Someone suggested issuing a new Shanghai currency based on British gold, with a value of eight pence, and it is said that many foreign businessmen agree. Shanghai is my country's only trading port. Since the opening of the port, Chinese and foreign transactions have been based on my country's currency. Although foreign banks have taken advantage of the "worship of foreign countries" mentality in the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China to issue banknotes, since the issuance of banknotes by Chinese banks, after Yuan Shikai's selfishness in the third year of the Republic of China, the exchange of Chinese banknotes was stopped. At that time, Mr. Song Hanzhang, the president of the Bank of China in Shanghai, did not accept the chaotic order and continued to exchange normally, which made the credit of the Bank of China's banknotes last until today. The same banknote seems to be valuable for the Bank of China's banknotes, which shows the great effect of this move and the deep impression. After the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, the awareness of national economy became stronger, and the scope of use of foreign bank banknotes became narrower and eventually disappeared. After the implementation of legal tender, the issuance of banknotes was centralized, which was convenient for all industries and made circulation more convenient. Now foreign merchants often shrink sharply because of the foreign exchange black market, only care about their current interests, regardless of the difficulties of the absolute majority of Chinese people in Shanghai, and increase prices again and again, such as public utilities, has enjoyed a monopoly treatment, although coal prices have risen, but not suddenly increased, and price increases frequently, monetary concepts, egoism is too strong, so regardless of the burden of the public, and this does not meet their desires, but also want to use China's few import industry and a few wealthy funds to escape the mentality, afraid that the legal tender will continue to fall, afraid that prices will not rise, afraid that their business security is not individual, and can only exercise its nature equal to the foreign currency in the Shanghai market suggestions, if adopted this statement, even to implement it will destroy my country's monetary system, It will inevitably make the circulation of legal tender in Shanghai greatly hindered, and speculation will occur between legal tender and new currency. Making the already unified monetary system become non-unified also undermines the British authorities' promise to maintain legal tender. Since Shanghai is a local place in my country, and legal tender is the world-recognized currency of my country, we should use my country's currency in my country's territory, and we should not issue a new currency separately. Chinese and foreign merchants want to seek trade development, and often cooperate to stabilize foreign exchange and consolidate the foundation of legal tender, and not help the tyrant to do evil, and there is an indirect action to destroy legal tender is the long-term benefit.</p>

<h3>Chinese and Foreign Artillery</h3>
<p>China used stone artillery in ancient times, and now uses fire artillery. The system of stone artillery began with Xuanyuan, and Fan Li used the method of flying stones, Li Mi used the attack of Guangyun artillery, and Yanshou threw stones by hand, Hao Zhao used ropes to transport stones, and Zhuge Liang used siege vehicles to break through the formation. All of them were the most famous users of stone artillery in later generations. The system of fire artillery began with Yuan Shizu obtaining Western Regions fire artillery and using it to attack Caizhou city. Ming Dynasty sought its system more widely and became the ancestor of a generation of fire artillery. In the Yongle period, the Shenji artillery was obtained and specially placed in the Shenji camp, while the General Cannon used carts, and the Yihu artillery and Baizi artillery used frames. In the fourteenth year of Zhengtong, Yu Shan asked to cast two-headed copper artillery, each containing ten bullets. During the Jingtai period, Shi Xiang made a machine with milling, which fired three times in a moment and could reach three hundred steps away. In the third year of Tianshun, Canjiang Fang Yongyan said that he used firearms to break the enemy, named Jiulong Tong, which fired nine arrows simultaneously in one burning. In the eighth year of Jiajing, Youdu Yushi Wang Hong praised the benefits of the Folangji. At the end of Zhengde, Guangyuan obtained its system and made it of copper, five or six feet long, with the larger ones weighing a thousand catties and the smaller ones weighing one hundred and fifty catties. It had a huge belly and a long neck, with a Xiu hole in the belly, with five sub-cannons, loaded with medicine and placed in its belly for firing. It was also beneficial for naval battles and was driven by centipede boats. It was invincible wherever it went. Bai Sha's patrol inspector He Xu obtained its method and ordered it to be made and sent to various borders, calling it the General Cannon. In the nineteenth year of Wanli, the late Governor Huang Yingyong said that the General Cannon weighed hundreds of catties, but it was very difficult to use. Later people imitated it and made it empty, using hemp ropes to string it with medicine bullets. It was light and easy to lift, and the cost was also saved. Later, when Western ships arrived, they obtained a huge cannon called Hongyi, which was more than two feet long and weighed up to three thousand catties. When fired, it could crack stone walls and shock dozens of miles. According to the use of iron cannons, as far as China is concerned, ancient times are not as good as today. Compared with Western countries, China is not as precise as Western countries. Now, observing the artillery of Prussia, it changes monthly and innovates daily. The reason is that they abandon the old and seek the new, and they are constantly researching. The Chinese people used to know the precision of French artillery, but now they know that Prussian artillery is even more precise.</p>

<h3>To Zhangdian</h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>——War Zone Reminiscence</p>
<p>Before the Battle of Wuhan’s Outskirts was launched, Dabie Mountain seemed very unfamiliar, just like Dahong Mountain, Taihang Mountain, and Zhongtiao Mountain, not arousing people's universal interest; moreover, it had never received praise from any poet, so it had to let Mount Lu and other mountains steal the limelight. However, this nameless hero was preparing with a posture of devouring everything, complex paths, overlapping ridges, and deep valleys that would make people's heads ache, and cause them to sigh, "It's impossible to go!"; otherwise, Wuhan has been occupied for more than nine months, why hasn't a single grass or tree been damaged, isn't this obvious evidence?</p>
<p>Its overall appearance is like this: Starting from Tongbai Mountain, it meanders southeast, passing through Henan and Hubei provinces and entering Anhui, directly connected to the Anhui Mountains, becoming the watershed between the Yangtze River and the Huai River. The eastern part extends into Yingshan County, Anhui Province, and then turns northeast from Huoshan, entwined in Qianshan, with the main peak reaching 6,500 feet, each being Tianzhu Mountain. The northern branch extends eastward from Hefei, ending at Zhangbaling. If we put it symbolically, it resembles a crouching warrior, with two arms like steel chains extending into Henan and Hubei, and a torso cast from pig iron standing tall in western Anhui. It's not that we intentionally exaggerate; during the previous "encirclement" period, three routes were taken to advance, and the route that advanced from Shangcheng through Suxianshi was blocked at Gouji Ridge, the other two routes were blocked at Songzi Pass and frustrated at Yangliudian, neither able to cross the Lei Pool even a step. So, using the past as an example for the present, even if one could enter, it would be hopeless to get out.</p>
<p>That day, we arrived at Zaoxie River, and looking from afar, Gouji Ridge appeared in the clouds, so we rushed to Zhangdian in the early coolness in one breath.</p>
<p>Bu, bu, bu...,</p>
<p>The sound of rifles suddenly echoed from the mountain hollow, because in the surrounding deep mountains, the sound seemed particularly loud, and it continued to fire.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" Little Shen asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"Maybe they've attacked Dabie Mountain!" Old Yao said mockingly.</p>
<p>Then, there was a burst of laughter. When we crossed the ridge and appeared opposite the pine forest, two teams of warriors were practicing field combat, a stone, a tree, and a pile of dirt were all used as cover for assault. They lay prone on the grass, assumed aiming poses, and simultaneously surveyed, moved, and chased cautiously. After half an hour, they began to withdraw. Looking at the insignia on their sleeves, we knew they belonged to General Feng Zhi'an's troops. Through mutual singing and introductions, we began talking to the captain, from the fall of Beiping to the transfer to western Anhui for defense.</p>

<p>There is no need to give any definitions or explanations. Literature and art are not technology. This should be universally known to those who understand literature and art. Since it is technology, there should be no such thing as construction or destruction. However, literature and art have their own constructiveness and also have the ability to destroy. Because no one can deny: literature and art, in the hands of people, can be used as tools, and can also be used as weapons. And in fact, everything so-called "tool" in the world is precisely another way of saying "weapon."</p>
<p>For example, wartime literature and art, regardless of whether it directly reflects or exposes, should at least be able to stand on the foundation of construction. War is of course a material war, but psychologically it is an active construction. The battlefield is a scene of ashes, and although more than ten thousand elite soldiers are killed or wounded, we are left with a profound concept of struggle. The longer the war lasts, the greater the material losses, and the more determined the resolve to fight. Isn't this construction? This construction, in its promotion, requires the help of literature and art.</p>
<p>Conversely, construction necessarily involves destruction. To build a building of more than ten stories, one must first level the soil on the ground, and also deeply penetrate the foundation. To build a new era in literature and art, one must first eliminate the old dregs. This is originally a reasonable statement, and no one can deny it. However, in reality, people often forget that new products need old fertilizers to cultivate, and new construction needs old gardens to serve. At the same time, we cannot cut our feet to fit the shoes and remove everything that is not our own construction. Our construction is in our construction, and the construction of others should also grow. A good garden only grows one kind of flower, especially in the literary and artistic garden, as long as it is not a pest, there is no reason why it cannot be accommodated.</p>
<p>Talking about literature and art will naturally involve thought. When thought is involved, it may not be in line with the goal of construction. Construction is naturally not backward, not regressive, and does not necessarily shout loudly, only seeking that its voice be heard ten or a hundred miles away. Construction is in the production of new forms, not in the mutual exchange of clichés. In construction, there is no reason to exclude others, and there is no need to lead those with ulterior motives down the same path. Literature and art have thought, and thought has its own subjectivity. Sometimes the tip of subjectivity is a sharp blade; this sharp blade should be used on the enemies of the opposing camp, not to suppress brothers who are also in production and construction. Whether it is an individual or a group, as long as the "individual" does not forget their position, or the "group" is not selfish, they are all construction. If one can't wait to be the leader and wants to suppress the success of others and prevent the progress of others, then not only is one not building, but even actively destroying.</p>
<p>The same is true in the realm of literature and art.</p>
<p>To open up barren gardens, to build solemn palaces, or to produce a great work, there is a common goal: that is, authenticity. Empty shouting will not work, and waving flags empty-handed will not work either. If the throat is shouted hoarse and the drum surface is pierced, where is the achievement of construction? Ideal? Illusion? Mr. Lu Xun once admonished his son in his will, saying not to be an empty-headed literary artist. What is an empty-headed literary artist? Simply put, it is a literary artist who does not engage in construction.</p>
<p>Construction is construction. There is no paper tiger that is successful forever. We should bring literature and art to the mountains and plains of war to depict the mask of the times; but we cannot bring the form of war into the realm of literature and art to engage in struggles of contention and harm. What is needed in the realm of literature and art is construction, not the destruction of construction. The masses are in front of us, urgently awaiting the construction of new war weapons and new food supplies.</p>
<p>Being detached, not fighting with others, indifferently transcending the world, all kinds of attitudes are what we do not need; and literature and art that undermine the rear and stir up trouble with words are even greater enemies of ours today.</p>
<p>The country is in active progress, and is waiting for the construction in the literary and artistic garden to flourish.</p>
<p>Many mountains are suitable for prolonged battles; a vast land can endure a long march. Who can achieve victory? It will ultimately be as clear as the sun.</p>

<h3>Two Prose Poems</h3>
<p>— Chuan Gen</p>
<p>Phantom</p>
<p>A shadow is depicted in the forest, like a cloud? Like twilight? Like a pool of still water? Like hazy twilight? Like the spring sun? ... But it looks like nothing, it is the most cruel desolation in the world.</p>
<p>I reached out to touch it, but unexpectedly, my hands were buried in the melancholy, empty darkness, and in a daze, I lost the dream of a lifetime.</p>
<p>In the mountains and forests, there is still a haze.</p>
<p>The wind spread the dust, blew off the wheat stalks, withered the grass, stirred the spring water, and blew away the gloomy wilderness, but it could not penetrate the phantom-like life.</p>
<p>Lonely tree shadow, you ask me: "What time is it?"</p>
<p>"..." I looked up at you.</p>
<p>I wanted to say: "Anyway, it's a sunny day."</p>
<p>But I said this instead: "The real sun no longer shines."</p>
<p>"Then, is it all darkness?" you asked again. ';I tell you: "The phantom of life is originally buried in darkness. Strange music</p>
<p>In the quiet night, I wore starlight and stepped on dew, looking for some lost sounds.</p>
<p>But there was nothing on the desolate land.</p>
<p>So I wrapped my disappointed soul and leisurely crossed the small bridge.</p>
<p>In the distance, a burst of music floated:</p>
<p>Although the night is long,</p>
<p>It cannot bury our daytime,</p>
<p>The south wind brings us</p>
<p>The news of dawn:</p>
<p>Lonely passerby,</p>
<p>Don't linger in disappointment anymore!</p>
<p>Oh, I found it, this kind voice, this strange music lingering on the walls of my heart.</p>
<p>The dawn has risen slightly in the clouds, I am walking forward, stepping on the exciting and victorious footsteps, and closely following my feet is the dawn.</p>

<p>Enthusiasm</p>
<p>Who among young people is not filled with excessive enthusiasm? If it is lacking, it is a morbid state.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm is like a bonfire, burning fiercely, illuminating the road in the vastness; in this cold world, it gives people the heat of life and the courage of life.</p>
<p>Enthusiasm should also be cherished, used well, and not wasted in vain. It should be vented on sacred causes. Rely on youth to do more of what young people should do, after all, freedom is more precious.</p>
<p>"The sacrifice at Nanyuan was really too great!" I said.</p>
<p>"That's right, especially the students who were just training," he said with regret, "their boiling blood did not demand a corresponding price!"</p>
<p>"Then how did you escape?" Little Shen couldn't help but interject.</p>
<p>"No, no," the captain replied, "I was defending Yongdingmen and retreated to Nankou with the main force."</p>
<p>In the sound of the military flute as they continued to practice, we left Zhangdian.</p>
<h3>Farewell to You Fan</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Water connects to the sky, the sky connects to the water, a vast ocean. A ship cuts out a line of waterway like a sharp knife, the sea spitting out white foam painfully along the wound. The thick chimney proudly spews out wisps of smoke, heading towards the blue sky (Madeli-like sky).</p>
<p>Sitting at the farewell banquet, I have distant imaginations. There are graceful smoke rings in front of me.</p>
<p>"University of Michigan by Lake Michigan, Michigan." He said this amusing address. So, someone wrote it down, "It's a lake, not a river, the lake of the lakeside poets." He corrected, "You have to write in English."</p>
<p>"Lakeside Poets," I grabbed these four words. Our friend is also a poet. But, I don't know if he likes Wordsworth. I heard that his poems are all praises of life, but unfortunately I have read very few, and my impression is weaving skill and delicacy. My opinion is that it should be written more rudely and simply. The conscience of art should and must be upright, regarding the current</p>
<p>Current topics are like lake water, flowing arbitrarily, one sentence here, one sentence there, one laugh followed by another. I am silent, strangely silent. "Why don't you speak?" I smiled, looking at the graceful smoke rings.</p>
<p>"Will you still love literature and art in four years? - What you love now"</p>
<p>"I think so. But maybe I will write more prose."</p>
<p>"That's good, but I'm afraid it's difficult?" I knew he was going to study business administration</p>
<p>"Will you still remember us? What about the motherland?"</p>
<p>"Of course I will, and I will remember the motherland even more. Over there, I will do what I can do."</p>
<p>We all laughed, young people's laughter, brightly.</p>
<p>So, we talked about our ages and birthdays, I am the third brother, he is the fourth brother. We have older brothers, younger brothers, and a sixth sister. Holding hands, tightly. We laughed loudly again. The chairs also laughed creakily.</p>

<p>Law</p>
<h3>Notice to Readers</h3>
<p>This year's Labor Day, at the request of the Central Daily News, this association will edit "Law." The beginning of its publication coincides with the eve of the 10th anniversary of the establishment of this association. Looking back over the past ten years, this association's focus on law has been limited to discussions and exchanges among colleagues. Although occasional research results have been offered to the legislative authorities, it has not been able to universally serve the general public. Since Shen Bao has entrusted the editorial duties, we are deeply pleased to have the opportunity to serve, so we resolutely accepted the task, and assigned more than ten members to specialize in it, so as to show that we are not perfunctory.</p>
<p>When "Law" was published, several matters were announced, namely, to support legal justice, promote the spirit of the rule of law, collect materials for research at any time, and popularize legal common sense to the public. It has only been three months since then. Colleagues have worked diligently and readers have enthusiastically supported, all taking this as their common goal, and striving to reach the final goal. However, the evolution of events is something that cannot be predicted. The current economic situation is changing rapidly, turbulent and unstable. Although the current financial turmoil was caused by speculators seeking profit, the result has been rising prices, with paper prices doubling compared to the past. The Shen Bao authorities, in this difficult situation, still uphold their past spirit as a mouthpiece for the people. However, with so many weekly publications, the cost is naturally huge. Since there is no supply of domestic goods, they have to seek ways to remedy the situation. Therefore, various weekly publications will be temporarily suspended. This "Law," which was born just three months ago, will also be temporarily separated from the readers. Shen Bao is in a difficult situation to continue, and this association has a heart full of helplessness. We know that readers will also have the same feeling.</p>
<p>It is also fair to say that, although "Law" has only been published for a short time, we have never slacked in our cultivation and irrigation. All research and commentary works have grasped the center of the times and expressed sincere opinions. Even the columns of judgments and official documents have tried their best to collect widely, hoping to provide practical help. As for the answers to questions, based on laws and regulations, considering the circumstances and reasoning, without being tired of seeking details, all have been witnessed by readers. Although we are suddenly saying goodbye to you today, the time is inevitably too short, but precisely because the time is short, it is worth savoring. The Shen Bao authorities certainly do not want this phenomenon to last forever, and the members of this association also urgently want to have another opportunity to contribute their efforts. Therefore, readers may wish to slightly reduce their reluctance to say goodbye, and the day of reunion is not far away.</p>
<p>Now, as we temporarily part ways, we offer a word, hoping that readers will understand and appreciate it!</p>
<p>Research and Criticism</p>
<h3>A Study on the Non-Competition Obligation of Company Directors</h3>
<p>— Zhou Kun</p>
<p>Our Civil Code and Company Law stipulate that the manager of a firm and the unlimitedly liable shareholder of an unlimited company may not, without the permission of the firm (Article 562 of the Civil Code) or the unanimous consent of the other shareholders of the unlimited company (Article 6, Paragraph 1 of the Company Law), operate a business of the same kind as the company themselves or for others, nor may they be an unlimitedly liable shareholder of a company of the same kind. However, the firm (Article 563 of the Civil Code) or more than half of the other shareholders of the unlimited company (Article 28, Paragraph 2 of the Company Law) may regard the actions they have taken for themselves or others as actions taken by the company. The legal provisions are very clear and unambiguous. However, whether the director of a limited company is also subject to the non-competition obligation is a matter that is worthy of study.</p>
<p>The director of a limited company is the shareholder who represents the company and executes its business. Therefore, whether they are a director specifically representing the company externally or a director executing business internally, they all have extensive powers and heavy responsibilities. They are deeply familiar with all the internal details of the company's business. If they use this knowledge to operate the same kind of business for themselves or others, and compete with the company, or become an unlimitedly liable shareholder of another company, then the company will inevitably be significantly affected, and all shareholders will suffer disadvantages. Therefore, in order to prevent conflicts of interest and fulfill their responsibilities, they should all be subject to the non-competition obligation.</p>
<p>Article 158 of our old company regulations stipulated that directors may each represent the company, and the provisions on non-competition obligation were placed in paragraph 2 of that article. Therefore, all directors should be subject to it, and there is no problem. However, after examining Article 145, Paragraph 1 of our Company Law, it stipulates that "the company may, in accordance with the articles of association or the resolution of the shareholders' meeting, designate one or more directors to represent the company," and Paragraph 2 stipulates that "the provisions of Articles 28 and 31 to 33 shall apply mutatis mutandis to directors." The legal text on non-competition obligation is placed after the directors specifically representing the company, so it seems that only the directors specifically representing the company should be subject to the provisions on non-competition obligation. Other directors executing business can be unrestricted. I believe that if such an interpretation is made, it will be inappropriate in terms of legal principles and human feelings. The director executing business is the highest administrative organ of the company internally. Even the appointment and dismissal of managers is within their power (Article 144 of the Company Law). If they can be unrestricted, then if they engage in private fraud and do whatever they want, the abuses will be endless and the harm will be immeasurable. Not only will they fail to protect the interests of other shareholders, but it will also not be a blessing for the commercial society. Moreover, it clearly violates the strict legislative intention of Article 28 of the Company Law, which stipulates that all shareholders executing business are uniformly subject to the non-competition obligation. Furthermore, managers are selected and appointed by directors and are still subject to the non-competition obligation, while directors executing business, whose powers are higher than those of managers, can be unrestricted. This is also quite contradictory in terms of reason. I am afraid that the legislation often has negligence regarding the technique of legal provision structure. To prevent disputes, we can only wait for the interpretation of the Judicial Yuan.</p>
<p>The fact that directors should be subject to the non-competition obligation has been stated above. As for how directors can engage in the same kind of business, and how to exercise sanctions when the non-competition obligation is violated, there is also a need for explanation in law. I will divide them into the following:</p>
<p>(A) How can directors engage in the same kind of business? Article 28, Paragraph 1 of our Company Law stipulates that "shareholders may not, without the consent of all other shareholders, engage in acts of operating a business of the same kind as the company for themselves or others, or be an unlimitedly liable shareholder of another company." However, what is stipulated in that article refers to the shareholders of an unlimited company. Therefore, it says "the consent of all other shareholders." If a limited company and an unlimited company have different structures, the application will often be inconsistent. Since the number of shareholders of a limited company is certainly very large unless it is established by promoters, it is factually impossible to obtain "the consent of all other shareholders." Therefore, if a director of a limited company wants to engage in the same kind of business, the phrase "without the consent of all other shareholders" should, in the author's opinion, be interpreted as "without the resolution of the shareholders' meeting." That is, more than half of the shareholders representing more than half of the total number of shares must be present, and the resolution must be passed by more than half of the voting rights of those present (Article 100, Paragraph 2 and Article 128, Paragraph 2 of the Company Law).</p>
<p>(B) How to exercise sanctions when the non-competition obligation is violated? Article 28, Paragraph 2 of our Company Law stipulates that "when a shareholder violates the provisions of the preceding paragraph, the other shareholders may, by a resolution of more than half, regard the acts they have taken for themselves or others as belonging to the company, but this shall not apply after one year from the act." The phrase "a resolution of more than half of the other shareholders" also refers to the sanctions against shareholders of an unlimited company. In the author's opinion, when sanctioning directors of a limited company, in addition to the resolution of the shareholders' meeting being naturally valid, other provisions of the Company Law can also be invoked, namely: First, the supervisor (Article 160 of the Company Law); Second, shareholders holding more than one-tenth of the total number of shares (Article 150 of the Company Law) can all directly exercise their rights, so as to avoid the various procedures of convening a shareholders' meeting and requiring a resolution of the shareholders' meeting, thereby achieving the effect of quick use of power. However, I have something that is inappropriate, and I hope that scholars at home will teach me. Research on ownership</p>
<h3>Study of Ownership</h3>
<p>— Zheng Baohua</p>
<p>Reading the inaugural address in the first issue of this publication on May 1st, it stated that there are four methods for studying law: first, the philosophical method; second, the analytical method; third, the historical method; and fourth, the sociological method. Among these four, using philosophical, analytical, and historical methods to study law all have their shortcomings. If one seeks perfection and accuracy, there is no other way than to apply the sociological method. This statement is quite insightful and serves as a guiding light for those studying law who are unsure of which method to choose. Observing legal phenomena or exploring their results from a sociological perspective yields different results than those obtained through philosophical, analytical, or historical methods. Moreover, because it is obtained through the sociological method, it can be integrated with actual society, avoiding the criticism of "building a cart behind closed doors" or "cutting the feet to fit the shoes." This article will discuss the foundation of ownership theory based on the above opinions.</p>
<p>What is the basis for the establishment of initial ownership? Why is ownership in principle inviolable? On this, scholars have different views due to their different methods of studying law. Some advocate the "first occupancy theory," some the "labor theory," some the "legal definition theory," some the "needs theory," some the "economic theory," some the "human nature theory," and finally, some the "evolutionary theory." There is much debate and no consensus. It is lamentable that without a clear understanding of research methods, one will inevitably be dizzy and confused, not knowing what to do. Now, the main points of these various theories are listed below:</p>
<p>The first occupancy theory states that originally, all objects were unowned. Whoever first applies their intention and physical strength to an unowned object and occupies it acquires ownership of the object and can exclude the interference of others. This recognizes first occupancy as the basis for originally acquiring ownership of movable or immovable property.</p>
<p>The labor theory recognizes that the original acquisition of ownership of an object is entirely due to human labor. This means that ownership is entirely derived from production. For example, unowned wasteland is acquired through reclamation, minerals are acquired through mining, and other newly produced objects created by labor changing raw materials all belong to this category.</p>
<p>The legal definition theory recognizes that the original acquisition of ownership and its inviolability are both granted by law. If the law does not protect ownership, then ownership may be difficult to continue to exist.</p>
<p>The needs theory believes that the fundamental reason for the occurrence of ownership is that people have various desires that need to be satisfied. The desire to satisfy these desires must be filled through the method of ownership of things. This is the function of ownership.</p>
<p>The economic theory recognizes that ownership has its place and can exist because it is beneficial to the social economy. The initial cause of ownership is also due to its benefit to the social economy. This theory and the aforementioned needs theory both belong to the economic aspect of the argument.</p>
<p>The human nature theory recognizes that ownership arises from human nature. Humans cannot maintain their lives and develop physically and mentally without using external objects to support themselves. Therefore, the initial fact of the existence of ownership is entirely due to human nature, recognizing that objects should not be obtained by force, and that people should respect each other's ownership of things obtained through labor, which is a necessary condition for human survival and development. This is what the human nature theory considers to be the origin of ownership.</p>
<p>As for those who advocate the evolutionary theory, they believe that ownership exists because it actually adapts to the changing evolution of social life.</p>
<p>Now that the main points of the various theories have been clarified, we will now criticize the merits and demerits of the above theories from the perspective of the latest sociology. However, the purpose of this article is to prove that applying the sociological method is superior to other methods. As for whether our criticism of the theories is appropriate and which of the above theories is most appropriate, it cannot be said that there is no room for different opinions. From a sociological perspective, the idea of first occupancy is not clear enough. Is it limited to the scope of physical strength? Or any scope within the reach of mental strength? Moreover, first occupancy is only a fact and is not enough to explain the origin of ownership. For example, making wood into a boat, casting iron into wheels, melting copper into a bowl, or fermenting grapes into wine to obtain ownership of the boat, wheels, bowl, and wine is the result of labor, not through first occupancy. Moreover, according to Article 814 of the current Civil Code, "If a person processes movable property of another, the ownership of the processed object belongs to the owner of the materials, but if the value added by the processing clearly exceeds the value of the materials, the ownership of the processed object belongs to the processor." Therefore, when the processor obtains ownership according to this article, it has nothing to do with first occupancy. Conversely, if labor is regarded as the only source of acquiring ownership, it is also not correct. There are many cases in the world where people gain without labor or obtain huge ownership with minimal labor. Because processing the property of others, except in the circumstances of Article 814 of the aforementioned Civil Code, generally cannot obtain ownership. Moreover, land is not fundamentally created by human labor, but merely by cultivating and farming on the surface of the land. Therefore, the ownership of the land itself is not entirely related to labor. As for the legal definition theory, it ignores that ownership actually exists before the law. Because it has legitimate and inviolable reasons, the law then protects it. If ownership is created by law, it is inevitable to stick to legal formalities and ignore the spirit of the law, abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the superficial. According to the needs theory, human desires are difficult to satisfy, and greedy people will use this as a talisman to start disputes and robberies, and how can order be maintained? Moreover, it ignores the function of labor in the composition of ownership, so it is also inappropriate. The economic theory recognizes that the social economy develops due to the existence of ownership, which also seems to be a specious argument. The existence of individual ownership also hinders the social economy, such as large landowners having tenants cultivate their land and only collecting their profits. The evolutionary theory uses evolution to explain the origin of ownership, while ignoring the universal and unchanging principles of human nature. It is a fact that ownership changes with the times, but this is only a change and not the cause of the creation of ownership. So how does ownership occur and where is its source? If we infer it by the sociological research method, the human nature theory seems to be the most appropriate. Ownership changes with the necessities or interests of group life, and group life originates from human nature, so ownership also arises from human nature. Aristotle said, "Man is a social animal." Hobbes said, "Everyone fights each other, which is human nature." It can be seen that human beings inherently have a heart of love and a feeling of hatred. Respecting the ownership of others is caused by this heart of love; repelling the interference of others with one's own ownership is caused by this feeling of hatred. Without the above-mentioned natural human nature, ownership would be difficult to occur. Since we determine the origin of ownership based on human nature, we will further study it from the perspective of sociology. Although we know that ownership is a necessary condition for the survival and development of each individual, and each individual must have the freedom to acquire ownership, when exercising this freedom, it must be limited to the scope of not infringing on the ownership of others, and it must be done through legitimate means. This is why the exercise of ownership is generally limited in the progressive civil laws of various countries. If rights are not exercised for a long time, such as allowing land to be barren and not cultivating it, it is recognized as anti-social behavior, and the law intervenes to force its exercise. As for the abuse of rights, the laws of various countries have more express provisions to restrict it. The disposal of property, due to social relations, in certain circumstances, cannot allow the freedom of the owner, such as even if it is the industry completely owned by the husband, when his ownership is transferred to others, the consent and participation of his wife must be obtained. The current civil law of our country also has express provisions on the restrictions on the exercise of ownership, such as Article 765 of the Civil Law of Property Rights stipulates, "Within the scope of legal restrictions, the owner may freely use and dispose of his property and exclude the interference of others," and Article 773 stipulates, "The ownership of land, unless otherwise restricted by law, extends to the upper and lower parts of the land within the scope of its beneficial exercise. Interference by others that does not hinder the exercise of its ownership may not be excluded." Also, Article 793 stipulates, "When the owner of land has gas, steam, odor, smoke, heat, ash, noise, agitation, and other similar intrusions into the land of others, he may prohibit it, but this does not apply if the intrusion is minor, or if the land shape and local customs deem it appropriate," and Article 790 stipulates, "The owner of land may prohibit others from entering his land, but this does not apply in the following circumstances: 1. Others have the right of passage. 2. According to local customs, others are allowed to enter unfenced fields, pastures, and mountains to cut weeds, collect dead branches, or collect wild animals, or graze livestock." Article 791, paragraph 1 stipulates, "When the owner of land encounters the articles or animals of others occasionally entering his land, he shall allow the possessor or owner of the articles or animals to enter it to search for and retrieve it." These are all provisions belonging to the restriction of ownership. The legislative reasons for all these provisions are nothing more than recognizing that the law is based on society, recognizing that today's society is a fusion of many people, that is, people are closely related and inseparable, and that there is a close relationship of mutual assistance between individuals, resulting in the emergence of social solidarity. The above-mentioned various restrictions on ownership are also based on social solidarity and recognize public interest as more important and individual interest as less important. Therefore, if we can study the law of modern ownership by the method of sociology, it will be easier to understand. If we apply other philosophical, analytical, historical, and other methods, it is still difficult to avoid discrepancies. The purpose of this article is to prove through the point of ownership that the method of studying law is most reliably the sociological method. Extending it, in today's modern society where the law is everywhere socialized, it is impossible to abandon the sociological research method when studying any law.</p>

<h3>The Troubles of Middle School Teachers</h3>
<p>— (Zhou Yong)</p>
<p>Everyone says that education is a noble undertaking. Indeed, those clerk-like teachers deserve the two words "noble," which means "noble" in poverty and "high" in emptiness. As for some boss-like principals, with money around them, they cannot be said to be "noble."</p>
<p>Recently, prices on the isolated island have repeatedly risen, and the cost of living is almost twice as high as before the war; but how much can the work of the salaried class increase? Especially those who are teachers, not only have not increased their prices, but also have to depreciate. Taking middle school teachers as an example, in the past, in public middle schools, the salary per hour of teaching was 1.25 yuan, 1.75 yuan, and now it is very difficult to get 8 jiao, 1 yuan; some also changed the original six-month salary system to a five-month salary system, leaving teachers with two months of income empty each year. As for private middle schools, a salary of 3 or 4 jiao per hour of teaching is commonplace. But you must know that being a teacher is not just selling energy to students in the classroom; and after class, you have to spend a lot of effort to prepare lessons, grade papers... Therefore, on today's isolated island, being a clerk-like teacher, even if you are busy all day long, you will inevitably have to pay a bit of your old capital for family life.</p>
<p>However, being able to get a salary is still better than others; some private middle schools only give teachers a few yuan of "travel allowance" each month; even if you save all of it, it is only enough for yourself to eat a hard meal. This kind of thing is naturally not common, but it does exist.</p>
<p>The depreciation of teachers' salaries is said to be because school expenses have increased, which seems to be reasonable. However, some schools have raised tuition fees, and most schools have increased the number of students. As for the schools that were originally public, most of them still receive subsidies; and the equipment is simple and does not require spending money. It can be seen that the income of many schools is higher than before the war; however, teachers' salaries have not only not increased, but have decreased instead. In severe cases, the number of students increases and the number of teachers is reduced in order to implement a contracting system; this strange thing also happens.</p>
<p>The above only talks about the material situation of teachers. As for the spiritual aspect, it is also troubling.</p>
<p>The education sector, like the political sector, often has factional disputes. If there are two factions in a school, then faction A will win over students, and faction B will win over teachers, which will inevitably lead to open and secret struggles. A teacher who sincerely runs education and can gain the belief of students will either be pulled around by them and waste a lot of unjust effort; or they will be suspected and distrusted by them and suffer all kinds of attacks and criticisms. In such an atmosphere, the style of teaching is swept away, and the style of learning is naturally impossible to rectify, let alone talk about the way of teachers?</p>
<p>Even in schools where there is no factional dispute, being a teacher is not necessarily pleasant; ingratiating oneself with the boss and perfunctorily dealing with colleagues is already troublesome enough, and middle school students are not as docile as elementary school students, so you have to please students. If a teacher wants to strictly enforce discipline and is unfortunately booed and driven away by some spoiled students, it is not only spiritually embarrassing, but also has the risk of losing their job. Because some school leaders are unwilling to offend customers and would rather let the clerks suffer injustice.</p>
<p>As for being a teacher and wanting the school authorities to spend a little money, add equipment; work a little harder, promote teaching; and make economic administration public, and have cooperation between teachers and students, etc.; that is not only a small voice, but also a faithful word is unpleasant to the ear, and you are suspected of having ulterior motives.</p>
<p>Especially now, the general schools do not express their attitude towards the departure and retention of teachers and staff until after the holidays; appointment letters are often issued only when the school is about to start. Therefore, teachers are always worried at the end of each semester: the occupation of the next semester seems to be hanging in the air; and even if they are rehired, the teaching is reduced, which has become a major problem in the lives of teachers.</p>
<p>Ah, noble teachers, in such circumstances, they will feel pain in their conscience and tremble in their spirit. To make the lives of teachers pleasant and the cause of education truly "noble," I request that the Chinese education authorities strictly implement the following principles:</p>
<p>(1) Adopt talentism: Break all prejudices and strictly prohibit all factional disputes.</p>
<p>(2) Hold a serious attitude: Ban schools with business properties; reform the facilities of various schools; implement strict teaching and discipline.</p>
<p>(3) Improve teachers' treatment: Increase teachers' salaries, to at least be able to maintain their family life; and extend the term of employment to stabilize their lives.</p>
<p>(4) Implement the spirit of education: The entire school, from the principal, director, teachers to students, and school workers, must be integrated and cooperate, eliminate barriers, and work together towards the educational goals of China.</p>
<h3>"Insufficient Sources"!</h3>

<h3>Summer Service for Refugee Children Movement</h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>The Chinese YMCA, after the successful conclusion of the Health Education Movement Week, the Boys' Division launched a summer service for refugee children movement. The goal of this movement is to allow members of the Boys' Division to have the opportunity to serve during the summer vacation and to make them more aware of the meaning of service. And the main task is to start by serving refugee children, helping teachers in various shelters, and promoting the education of refugee children. The intention is not to be unkind.</p>
<p>As far as I know, among all the members of the Chinese YMCA in Shanghai, in addition to adults, there are also boys, so there is a distinction between the adult department and the boys' department; and children under the age of sixteen can join the YMCA as boy members. The membership fees are much lower than those for adults, but boy members can also enjoy the same sports, library, bathroom and other facilities. The day schools and night schools attached to the YMCA, all the students are boy members, and at the same time, many young people from the vocational sector also join as boy members and use their spare time to study. In addition to implementing group life and working hard to study, general boy members also often use opportunities to serve the community, organize drama troupes, lecture groups, and establish voluntary night schools, etc.</p>
<p>After the YMCA Boys' Division began the summer service for refugee children movement, it started with training, and the association carefully selected several outstanding members for special training. After about ten days of training, they were sent to the No. 12 shelter on Yuyuan Road to serve. In order to perfect the work, the first four weeks were a trial period, and whether it would continue in the future would depend on the service performance. The service time is from 2 pm to 5 pm every day. The little teacher system is adopted. In terms of teaching materials, they are divided into (1) singing, (2) group games, (3) celebrity stories, (4) civic education, etc. In this way, members can get practical opportunities, and refugee children can get increased knowledge, which is really beneficial to both!</p>
<p>However, there are currently many refugee children in Shanghai, not only in shelters, but also wandering in the streets and alleys, the numbers may not necessarily be less than those in shelters. General refugee children are in a state of being out of school, and they are urgently in need of people to provide volunteer education, so that they will not become illiterate, and in the future, whether in their own lives or in their contribution to the society, they can increase their effectiveness by knowing some characters. It can be seen how important this work is. On the other hand, many literate youths with secondary education or above, instead of wasting two months of vacation time, it is better to serve refugee children. Therefore, I think the summer refugee children service movement should be promoted to the bodies of youths in every corner, and promoted to all refugee children in all shelters and street wandering refugee children in Shanghai, so that there will be a definite effect. Furthermore, it is not limited to the summer vacation, but after the summer vacation, this service for refugee children movement should continue to be promoted.</p>
<h3>The Iron Man's Last Road</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>“Ex-Champ”</p>
<p>After watching "Maritime Purgatory", I feel that a mediocre director is a great loss to the actors. In "The Iron Man's Last Road", Victor McLaglen was also buried. For example, in the drinking scene of McLaglen, he borrowed wine to relieve his sorrows under a very painful mood, but after the director added a gimmick, the audience laughed loudly, and intuitively felt that McLaglen seemed to be a clown in this scene.</p>
<p>The whole play is also piled up with some small gimmicks. The discord between father and son, and McLaglen's training of Bob, are not properly connected, so that the whole play only sees many trivial scenes. Even the final boxing match could not capture the tense air in the boxing ring.</p>
<p>Only after McLaglen secretly put the sleeping pill in the water, he walked out of the boxing ring blankly, and only when he got to the boxing room did he look at the medicine on his palm, and then sat down in fear. Here, the director handled the shouts in the boxing ring and the low music to accompany McLaglen's contradictory mood very well, but after Massey came in, the director used McLaglen's fainting to win the laughter of the audience.</p>
<p>A boxer who will win the boxing championship, because he is too old to dominate the boxing ring, is reduced to a gatekeeper. The son is in love with a rich woman and despises his father, but when the son spends money wastefully and misuses public funds, he is still deep in love with his son and wants to use illegal means to earn a huge sum of money. The director wrote such a story into a comedy, and naturally could not save its fate.</p>
<h3>Clear Skies After the Rain</h3>

<p>The second thing is the purchase of machines. Trading machines and building houses can be carried out at the same time, so as not to waste time. However, some of the machines can already be manufactured in China, while others cannot. The two Misses He studied the spinning green industry in the United States, and they also knew a little bit about textile machinery. In general, those who study abroad in a certain country believe in everything in that country. They studied in the United States, so they naturally believed in everything in the United States. Therefore, in their minds, if they trade machines, they must buy American machines. This is actually very reasonable. They learned in the United States and have some experience in the American textile industry. If they change to the machinery of another country, they will be at a loss. However, the material civilization of the world is progressing very quickly now, and it is often changing there. As the saying goes, "With a blink of an eye, the old hen becomes a duck." Although they have only returned to China for two or three years, the situation abroad has changed again. They feel that they have to go to the United States to order machines, and to order machines, they have to go to the United States themselves. They have already discussed it the day before yesterday. They said: "I don't want to be a manager, but I want to be an engineer." They have also discussed going to the United States. It is not only for the machine, they are preparing to do foreign trade for this silk weaving factory, to sell the finished fabrics abroad, so they must go to inspect in advance. There is no need for two people to go to inspect, only one person is enough. Or two people can take turns to go out, Liyu this year, Shuangyu next year, it is also possible. Because they are two people, Liyu is active, Shuangyu is quiet, of course Liyu is willing to go out first. Shuangyu also knows her wish, so if one of the two people goes out, she is also willing to let Liyu go out first. The night before last, they had already discussed this matter. Liyu said: "We will ask our father about this matter. If our father agrees that one of us two people will go out, please ask our father to appoint. Whoever our father appoints will go out." Shuangyu said: "I think there is no need to ask our father to appoint. When we go back, our father will say: You have already discussed and settled it yourself, why do you need me to appoint? If you decide to go out, it is reasonable for you to go out first, you should go out first." Liyu said: "What is the reason?" Shuangyu said: "You have the knowledge of yourself, you are more active than me, and you are better than me in everything in communication. There will be some banquets and other things when you go out for the first time, it is still more appropriate for you. What's more, you have studied painting, and weaving has a very close relationship with painting, etc., this is also more suitable for you." (165)</p>
