<p>重慶　日軍在北海以西欽州灣登岸後、瞬已數日、日軍進攻之目的、未能確定、南甯似為日軍進攻之目的、該地為桂省交通之中心、日軍由欽縣北進、桂粵兩省沿山分界、日軍距離山麓不遠、但該軍入內地益深、所遭遇華軍之抵抗益烈、欲團長驅直入、殊不可能、（廿日海通社電）</p>

<h3 id="c3">義大利對巴爾幹的態度 <a href="#c3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>長久已沒有聽到墨索里尼的吼聲，墨索里尼在二次大戰發生後，保持中立，不爲左右袒；德國方面的解釋，說義國這樣行動，使英法對義的態度捉摸不定，對德更爲有利；這不過是德國一種飾辭，其實義國與德國早已脫輻，不再受德國拘束；這當然不能說是義大利轉而親英法，但是他乘歐洲戰爭，想做一筆好的交易。義大利在地中海居於重要地位，不但德國有借重他的必要，即英法兩國，也一再向之討好，義大利也就居奇自重。當然義大利目前對英法的關係，已經不像以前那樣牴牾。義國邊防軍的自法國邊境撒退，重派巴斯湘甯尼爲英國大使，這都表示他的對英法友好的態度，然而這並不是放棄他對英法的要求。義大利對於地中海北菲法國領土的不能忘情，仍可於義大利日報蓋達的言論中，窺見一斑。蓋達最近曾說：「義大利期望殖民地問題的解決，義國爲凡爾賽和約所賣，該約未曾以殖民地給予義國，義國目的爲巴爾幹諸國政治上與經濟上的和諧，及殖民地之自由平等的解決。義相墨索里尼的鎭靜而武裝和平的政策，乃以等待與提防爲基礎」「等待與提防」，實可代表目前義大利的基本政策。這話的內容，自然不僅爲對英法而發，同時也爲對德蘇而發。向前者要求的，自然是殖民地問題，尼斯科西加，突尼斯的口號，早已給法國一個極大的印象。這次墨索里尼在羅馬威尼斯宮陽台向數萬羣衆發表武裝和平演說的時候，學生又喊出這口號，縱未得羣衆響應，然義國某觀察家聲明，對於地中海與北菲法國領的願望，迄未予以放棄，可見義國所待者，唯時機耳。至於目前更樂得觀望，因爲在西綫雙方對壘而未分勝負期間，就義大利的立塲講，自不便輕舉妄動，而把它可以左右全局的中立地位輕輕放棄；這是一。以中立國的地位，向雙方發展牠的國外貿易，自戰爭開始以來，已見蒸蒸日上，他新闢的航空綫，也由義境的尼泊勒港而經過荷屬印度抵達澳洲，他航行東方的商輪，每次開出，都擠滿了乘客，票價增加了百分之五十。無疑，義大利如果不從事戰爭，在貿易上可以獲得不少利益而使它有一時期的繁榮；這是二。</p>
<p>不過義大利對巴爾幹半島並不觀望，他一再聲明「義國不允許布爾雪維克的蘇聯，越過喀爾巴阡山（在前捷克邊境），而入多腦河流域，或巴爾幹進窺地中海，又說「共產黨希望利用他國之革命，而擴張其勢力於巴爾幹，則勢必與墨索里尼之主義與義國之軍隊衝突，」這就是表明巴爾幹半島是不許蘇聯染指的。這種論調，說是對蘇，不如說對德。德義兩國雖形成爲一軸心，可是過去在中歐在巴爾幹的利益，是互相衝突的。匈牙利的形成德國的附庸，奧國的被置入德國版圖，這些國家，義國歷來視爲勢力範圍，自從防共協定簽訂後，德國儼然盟主地位，義國外交遂隨着柏林而轉移，義國一切在中歐的利益，無形中都被德國剝奪侵攘，這是墨索里尼認爲怨苦無處伸訴的事。現在德國與蘇聯接近，把它全部的力量，對付英法，無暇顧及巴爾幹，墨索里尼自然認爲這是恢復義國在巴爾幹地位的極好機會，所以借反赤的名義，以遂其目的。墨索里尼的高呼防止蘇聯侵入巴爾幹，就是這種作用。至於義國在巴爾幹如何具體的發動，大約有待歐戰到了第二堦段，纔見切實開展！</p>

<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業　楊道南醫師著</p>
<p>自凟之惡癖起源於兒童之說，經醫學家的努力硏究，確已證明無訛。當兒童染此惡習之初，大部是無意識的；如因生殖器癢，他人撫摩其局部，或由他人之傳習，或模仿他人而發生之類似自凍的行動，並不感何等精神上的愉快，此後隨年齡之增長，神精之發育，一旦於無意中發生精神的愉快，生理的滿足；於是愛而爲有意識作用的自凟。同樣，少年人於看淫書淫畫的時，使色情的感覺異常興奮，於是不自主的以手撫摩之；因此而洩精，經此奇異的發現，勢必爲第二决第三次之嘗試，遂迭成有意意識的自凟。據此可知當兒童發生自凟之初，無論爲人所傳習，或自發現，大半均爲無精神作用的衝動行爲，後乃成有意識的行爲，所以自凟的事實，愈在幼年發生，其爲害亦愈大，因薄弱的神經，驟遇此强大的刺激，宛如細嫩的幼芽經遇暴風雨的摧殘，鮮有不衰頹萎地者。</p>
<p>至於女性的自凟，其害雖不若男子之烈，然久犯之後能使陰唇肥大，子宮發生障碍，其在精神上可說完全失却了處女精神之美，故此種女子大都將來難免墮落，總之，自凟不論任何時期，或男或女，犯此者能致神經衰弱，男性腎虧早洩，遺精滑精，面色蒼白，手足酸軟，耳鳴頭痛，百病叢生，故於兒童春機發動時，應善自檢束，母自放蕩，如自凟已釀成上述各症，應服以德國靑春腺素製劑男用「補體康」，經過廿四小時之後，即能生精補血，健腦固腎。蓋「補體康」之成分，完全採自雄壯動物之睪丸，用科學方法提出其精素，並摻入有益於人體之礦植物成分複製而成，具有補腦，補腎，補血之功，年老人在冬令服此，有返老還童之功，其女用「補體康」功能調經種子，爲婦科之良藥。</p>

<p>值茲寒季，稍一怠忽，卽易傷風，然傷風人多目爲小病，不足介意，多以普通正嗽之藥以爲敷衍之，豈知大錯，卽已種於此。及其症狀劇烈時，則取杏仁及糖漿服之，其症依然不减，此等藥品亦仍戀戀不捨，如此延長治愈之時日，卒使誘起病變，急性者成爲肺炎，病勢危殆，而處置一有不愼，卽喪厥生，卽幸得苟保生命，而體氣衰憊，遂爲結核菌所乘，發生肺癆，縱不至於死，顧療養須時，少亦三四年始能全愈，且來日能免復發與吾，尙在不能預知之數。至於症狀篤重之時，則雖幸而治愈，至少要費五年八年之久，而其金錢之損失，更不能數計，實不可不預爲處理者也。</p>
<p>再以余多年來臨床之經驗，因傷風咳嗽，而誘起險惡之肺病者，其例甚多。可勝浩嘆，蓋咳嗽一症，最易震動肺臟，此種動作，因爲使肺不得安寧，如其素有肺癆質之人，十九有爆發癆病之可能。有金壇翁希年君，共兩兄均以肺病死，死之年均在二十至三十歲之間。去秋彼於淴浴受寒，咳嗽頻頻，服止嗽鎭咳之藥，非但咳嗽未止，反而痰色轉黃，聲音嘶嗄，夜出盜汗，其家懼其成癆，而陷二兄覆輙。乞余治療，急投以肺病聖藥『補肺拿爾』，服後咳嗽於三小時內，卽行停止，而同時對於食慾亦大加振奮，不二星期，咳嗽已平愈，而身體昂壯，絕無病容，於是『補肺拿爾』一藥，翁君始信爲救命之恩物，從此，其家人凡一遇有咳嗽之人，即服『補肺拿爾』，無不獲全愈云。合於理想的</p>

<p>診所：甯波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>淋病有一種極使人感到不快的印象，厥爲淋病轉入慢性期中之淋系。但同時病家對淋系又有一種錯誤之感覺，卽以爲淋系已去，作爲本身淋病，業已全愈之微。不知此種觀念，亦同樣不足靠。因爲淋病並不以尿液潦淸，卽可視爲根治之理由。原來淋菌一物，體積至小，非目力所能視察而得之。大抵淋菌一過急性，共分泌液卽漸减少。但不可視爲淋病漸愈之微。蓋語其實際，此爲淋病的一種轉變，卽淋苗乘吾人忽略之際潛伏深入，待機而動，凡是患者此時一　動，或偶涉房事，尿液又轉溷濁，淋系則由滴而如浮絮，如此輾轉，病態由淺而深，　　性攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，精阜炎，膀胱炎，　　山患者蹉跎而來。</p>
<p>今欲肅淸此等頑强之淋病，自非徹底加以治療不可；必須實行除毒務盡之政策，若仍心存姑息，隨發隨治，與迷惑」般局部手術治療，絕對不能動搖淋菌之根蒂。因一般局部手術治療，僅及於尿道間，而一般市上劣藥，更無根治之功。余以二十年來之經驗，知要求肅淸淋系淋菌者，只有用德國感應靜電療法，WettererX療法，抗淋血淸。一方內服淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，使在廣汽而深處之淋菌，根本消滅；如此由淋菌而發生之可厭的淋系，自亦可以絕迹，而且一經治愈永遠可以不復再發　診時上午十時至下午六時。自卽日起每天送診廿號，每號僅取號金贈價値一元之「性病全書」一冊</p>

<p>又據大中社記者詢諸米業鉅子某某二君、據稱、米價連日在漲、除有人從中投機漁利外、實無其他理由、足資說明、若謂來源阻塞、存底不足、及因日本米慌而致、均屬混淆黑白之談、現每日到滬之米、至少七八千包、而上海每日所需米糧、七千包即足、存底又甚充足、至日人向內地吸收糧食、則大部份購辦蕪秈（即蕪湖一帶之秈米、）京滬路一帶運滬者、均爲粳米、自不受其影響、何以粳米竟在漲如此、原因不難明瞭、記者詢以傳聞投機份子集資合組公司、以圖大規模操縱米市、有否此事、則答以未悉詳情、惟米業團體則連日正在縝密調查、會商制止辦法、以期根絕未來隱患、</p>
<p>囤戶計敗　米價下跌</p>
<p>米價飛漲後、因幕後顯然有奸商操縱、故社會輿論、羣起貴難、而米市塲管委會、亦於前日决議制正掮客在市塲上任意抬高價格、使一般奷惡之徒、不得不稍歛形迹、昨日米市、水陸到貨、約共七千餘包、貨主至米市塲管委會登記承銷之米、較前增多四百餘包、爲一千九百包、米市塲開市後、情形較昨穩定、結果因來源通輰、而價格下降、各種粳米、每石下跌二元左右、秈米各貨、亦均下跌一元二三角、預計囤戶必因不能維持原價、急於拋售、而米價更趨下跌云、</p>

<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開承上週末午後之餘威、且匯市開後帶軟、再以某錢兌業與證券帮互相放盤收買、致開市即抬高至三千穴百六十元、乃錢兌業互做三十兩、詎料此時某銀樓忽代客傾吐二百餘兩、趨勢頓挫、立回落十五元、某銀樓售予金號二十兩、爲三千六百四十五元、此後匯市繼續軟化、且某銀樓已止塞觀望、故復見上升、證券帮進銀樓帮四十兩、爲三千六百六十元、嗣因外匯突然轉硬、銀樓帮與錢兌業等趁高競相吐塞、不久又回小二十元、銀樓帮售予錢兌業二十兩、爲三千六百四十元、其時某錢兌業復來吸收百兩光景、遂提高十元、某錢兌業進證券帮三十兩、爲三千六百五十元、後某金號與另一錢兌業前來求售、又撳低至三千六百四十元、將近午刻、某錢兌業復興買風、且晨初傾售之某銀樓、忽代港帮猛進、加以匯市已止鬆轉平、重向上升、未幾步高十七元、錢兌業進證券帮三十兩、爲三千六百五十七元作午收價、聞收後某某銀樓等買意仍濃、又抬三千六百六十元、午後曾由證券帮塞予銀樓帮三十兩、仍爲三千六百六十元、後因某錢兌業重振餘威、力進二百餘兩、且外匯穩中帶軟、致遂抬起十二元、某錢兌業進金號三十兩、爲三千六百七十二元、時證券帮猛售三百餘兩、遂回小七元、證券帮賣予銀樓帮二十兩、爲三千六百六十五元、入後證券帮賣意稍淡、且某錢兌業及散戶等頗有吃胃、遂又步高十五元、錢兌業進金號二十兩、爲三千六百八十元、將近收盤時稍形回下、證券帮賣予錢兌業二十兩、爲三千六百七十七元、結果比上週六午收軋漲四十七元、全日四十元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價、照烚赤高十元、收進的减小二十餘元、現標金照掛牌金低五六十元光景、</p>
<p>首飾金掛大五元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸三百七十元、迨至午後三時五十分掛大五元、結果大同行改懸三百七十五元、新同行與上價相同、收進約减低十五元至二十元之譜、</p>

<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、揭曉仍平、英美滙暗市、雖値週初、但仍無重大變化、蓋因最近塲內空氣沉寂、買賣不暢、昨日過程始終徘徊、初開港電首塞、而滙豐則力吸、繼之某美行扒入英金、同時一般華商買意復萌、故此刻及呈緊軟、一度曾緊至五便士二八一二五及八元五六二五、不久買方知足、美行復售美匯、更有港電亦重行吐出、遂見回平、延至午收、爲狀稍現微軟、計英金五便士三一二五美匯八元六二五、午後局勢常處於平穩中、日商銀行及投機家稍扒遠期、進口商有烟草結款、但未受影響、交易亦稀、結果收盤英金仍爲五便士三一二五、美匯稍軟達八元五九三七五、較上週末、英緊〇三一二五、美軟〇六二五、期貨做開趨勢與現貨相同、</p>
<p>美商港帮仍賣出</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條、及美銀價均休假無電、倫教生金呆定、滙兌英對美·對法俱平、對滬長〇六二五、美對英續縮二五、對滬大五分、對法小一二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金五便士三四三七五、美匯八元六五六二五、較之上週六、未分榮辱、開後雖港電前來吐出、但因匯豐頗有吃胃、且某美行亦吸收英金、故華商亦稍來扒結、致爲狀反見步軟、一度英金軟至五便士二八一二五、美匯亦緊達八元五六二五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後不久某美行突來賣出美匯、且港電復來拋塞、故市勢即見回平、計港電與某行售予大通有利等外行現貨英金五便士三一二五及三四三七五、並現貨美滙八元六二五及六五六二五、嗣後成交漸少、狀况亦平、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金五便士三一二五、美匯八元六二五、比晨開英美兩滙均微緊〇三一二五、</p>
<p>洋行結進現美滙</p>
<p>後市狀態極形平靜、雖日行與投機家稍來扒進遠期、及進口商吸進現貨美匯、但外行供意尙佳、致市面所緊極微計日行結進外行十二月份英金五便士二五、及投機商扒進某行十二月份美滙八元四三七五、兼進口商結入外行現貨美匯八元五九三七五、入後市象更靜、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金五便士三一二五、美匯八元五九三七五、十二月份英金五便士二五、美匯八元四六八七五、結果比上週六、現期英均微緊〇三一二五、美供略軟〇六二五、</p>

<p>證劵暗盤、昨日市況、其疲軟無神之狀況、依然未减、人心恍惚、一時殊難振作、昨日上午開盤多空雙方仍屬觀望者多、檯面交易大都爲搶帽子買賣、覓此蠅頭、聊資點綴、市價仍浮沉於五分一角之間、但比週六價仍屬微疲、午後交易已淸、多數完全無上落、少數仍升降於五分一角間、一種閒散情形、使集會人逐日减少、市價結果、多數小一二角、祗丁種因上週六下午未曾做開故獨好四角、成交總數共計的五十萬元之譜、茲列簡表於左、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交國貨銀行股三十股、價爲四十五元正、</p>
<p>昨日衆業公所下午股市開盤、極度活潑、在狂烈漲風下、向爲大衆注意各股、幾俱有新價出現、經一度岑寂後、會德豐股飛騰至六十八元半、較上週末收盤價高達三元之多、鋼業股亦曾升至十五元一角高價、嗣後各股、因獲利了結衆多、俱有相當回風、此點顯示市塲潛勢所至、消長實無定向也、</p>
<h3 id="c83">紗花　印棉大漲中　棉紗帶起甚微 <a href="#c83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>紗市平而靜、趨勢略見穏定、此因印棉大漲、致棉紗成本提高、於是一般執貨者心意安定、大都對於前途看有好面、脚地當可鞏固、賣風减縮、無奈實需依然呆木勿動、各路運輸殊感艱難、所以人心雖則振奮、漲風未起、實緣現貨消費與生產尙不能平衡也、待等生意一來、市面可望發展、</p>
<p>現紗晨初開盤、大家相聚言論、謂棉紗有脚地看升、因外棉漲力殊强、故人氣雖堅挺、然廣帮納胃不暢、實際交易、寥寥無幾、未免美中不足、開價漲二元、爲六百三十二元、中途做至六百三十四元、旋以吃客不旺、略回二元、查半日成交統計九百三十九包、上日成交四百十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲二元、天女漲四元、雙地球漲五元、今日出口棉紗有二百十件運香港、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<p>本棉交易尙堪支持、惟廠需又見沉寂良以紗銷旣滯、而各廠存積又見增高、故對於原料採辦意態鬆懈、至於日廠亦有同樣情形、所以日廠交易、愈形凋零、然海外印棉漲風猛烈、本擬有上升之望、詎上海市面不佳、同時內地到頭擁擠因之暫受牽制、未克前進、不過大衆心理、預料前途看樂觀也、蘇北來源、前昨兩日共到通花一萬包以外、大都販運商佔多數、一時各堆棧、塞得滿坑滿谷、大有容納不了之苦也、茲將現棉做開之價錄左、</p>
<p>另訊外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初開盤殊為堅定、投機殊形活躍、孟買帮在市搜購甚力、並引起一部份空頭抵補、現貨繼續異常良好、收槃價格較之上日漲五六磅音、印度棉市亦因苧蔴價格之猛漲、及投機者之猛烈拖買、猛漲九羅比餘、又接昨晨來電、昨晨開盤又漲十羅比、埃及漲三十餘磅音</p>

<p>邇來一路上漲之米市、自前午因一轟太足、亦感棘手、突見回軟、昨則更兼各路來源湧到、計有蘇嘉崑太靑楓等貨三四十車、人心愈餒、前者漲風旣烈、一遇挫折、回跌亦厲、內地帮旣多停手、本鄉店胃除應需略事添購外、亦皆觀望、全市銷塲與前者轟動之現象適成反比例、囤戶方面見已無利可圖、手中執有極多數之貴貨、當此出新正旺市面、變化劇烈之際、不無凛冰淵之戒、亦有謀擺脫之計、人心一虛、作風頓變反進爲出、羣相拋售、無如頹勢已成、挽回乏力、相率觀望、收受無人、乃不得不甩價忍痛割脫、致霎時跌風飇起、一般客販、有貨未售者、亦競相出樣、孰料作客見市面愈劣、購意更衰、所以各貨價節節下瀉、結果暴落達一二元至三元之巨、統計全市成數多不過四五千包、而若常特粳收盤行情爲三十八元、市三十七元、中三十六元、崑蘇白粳爲三十七元至三十四五元、靑沙菉種三十四五元、楓嘉菉種三十二三元、較前市貶落一三元不等、蘆羊尖開三十五元半、三十五元、因缺貨格價獨乏榮辱、客尖較降一元有奇、計江北尖三十四五元、京蕪尖三十五元、次至三十三元、陰變元小二元半左右、陳元三十七元、新三十六元、陰元三十五元半、三十三四元、總之此次在豐登湧旺之期、米價突然暴漲、全爲囤戶所激成、國難時期、生活艱難、囤戶等祇顧私人利益、剝削大衆、戾氣所鍾、豈能倖免、</p>
<p>另訊、客秈昨晨又被囤戶及收、市面繼續向上、投機操縱、浮戶搶風、更爲旺暢、終以存到兩少、供不敷求、市價逐步高升、晨市抬高近元、然價高後實銷早經袖手、獲利紛紛求脫、又値洋米再度成交、而皖蘇客秈早經聞風趕運、邇日漸有一二百包與三五百包之小批抵埠、途貨尙又絡繹到滬、人心頓軟、市面立呈反動、猛落　元左右、比之前日反小近元、全日實際則不逾三千包、</p>
<p>洋米定貨前後成交已有二千四百噸、五百噸、一千噸三批外、昨日續有二批定妥其中一千噸接洽較早、乃係三十五元關之即裝貨、月初可到、另一批四千八百噸一說四千七百噸則係下月中裝船、須下月下旬方到、價寫三十五元零二分、共計五批九千七百噸、包子約有十萬包之譜、統係達孚洋行經售、由糧米商行號聯合訂買云、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、印棉售價與美棉較、每擔貴上二十元左右、故無人問津已久、近日亦因美棉價日漲、交易轉鬆、廠方亦以紗銷呆滯、中止進辦、惟對於售價特廉者、則稍有採購也，茲將美棉以即期美滙八元六二五、計算棧交價於下、（碼頭交貨稅另加）</p>

<h3 id="c102">略輪「色情文學」 <a href="#c102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— 聖旦</p>
<p>如果說「淸談足以誤國，那麽，「色情文學」何嘗不會滅族！</p>
<p>也許是「危詞聳聽」吧？「色情文學」所含的毒素成分，決沒有海洛因那麼厲害，因爲大家知道，這不過是「紙上談兵」而已；何况眼前所流行的色情作品，不惟及不來曾經風靡一時的「戀愛創作」之類，即使鼓足氣力，拚命想承受舊衣鉢，也顯然望塵莫及；因此，「色情文學」除掉吸引少數墮落靑年之外，它是無法擴展其領域的。嚴格地說，現在所製造的色情作品，壓根兒就不配入於文學之林；假如承認這末流有文學價値，即無異承認「春畫」爲藝術作品；把它戴上文學的金冠，便糟塌聖潔的名詞。這種見解，自然不錯，但祇是屬於性質上的辨別，而未會理會到所生的作用和影響。</p>
<p>爲色情作品辯護者，一定要說，在冷酷與苦悶的現狀之下，當作家提筆在手的時候，似乎就有人在身邊警戒你，「當心點！」於是，大量的色情作品，便「應運而生」，其實，「當心點」固然是事實，却沒有硬勁捉牢誰的手腕，寫自己毀滅自己的東西。</p>
<p>然而辯護之道多端，也可以說，現狀下的人們正需要刺激，尤其是血氣方剛的靑年；那麼，問題的重心，就在這里了。我想刺激挺有效力的物品，莫過於雅片或嗎啡，在不斷地打呵欠時候，祇要注射一些些到血液裏去馬上會精神百倍的；而一些些雖則微乎其微，有時也能够匯爲洪流，而使人們遭滅頂之禍。間接呢？不容伸說，無形中會創弱尙待鬥爭的勇氣，泯滅靑年純潔的性靈，如了人家祈求不得的心願。</p>
<p>我們絕對不是道學家，要打起什麼衛道的旗幟，但對加緊趕造色情作品的「洋場的才子」，們最好不必以「當心點」或「刺激」爲掩護的理由，傳播毀滅社會的毒素。　這里，我還須增加一句：「色情文學」何嘗不會滅族！</p>
<h3 id="c103">路工 <a href="#c103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>夜霧凝潤的原野，被朝陽剝蝕了它迷濛的外衣。山路間，土壩上，都淸晰的顯現出一片泥濘。我移動步子，脚音猶如淺草中的蟲鳴。</p>
<p>旭輝如紗幔。層次的鱗雲，拖延到遼遠的天邊；那紫羅蘭色的溫和光影，染出了週遭的淸麗與幽靜。荒郊外，深沉而肅穆，不見村莊，也不見耕蹄，攪動空曠寂寞的，祇有晨風送來公路上的陣陣謳歌。謳歌着那粗壯而激昂的調子，是冶煉大地的一羣。</p>
<p>黝黑的面龐，光亮的眸子，紫紅的臂膊，堅硬的手掌，魁梧的身胚上，都表露出經風雨化成的活力。他們揮着鋤頭，鈀子，扁担滑上肩頭，有的在塡塞小浜，有的在鏟除高丘，有的在鑿開挺屹的岩石。兩臂像鳥翼，輕蕩於高空，腿子　　地前進。那些狹窄的田路，破落的荒村，濃密的森林，巉巖和峭壁，都在烈火似的活力裏被熔化成了流液，凝結出漫長的路面。</p>
<p>爬上山坡，路面隨着盤展上去，逐漸，逐漸，放寬那彎曲的小徑，鏟平那像蛇身起伏的山路。泥土翻滾如浪濤，飛起許多墨花。</p>
<p>我混雜於路工羣中，心田裏暗自驚嘆地勢險峻，越山開路工程的艱偉。對着段工頭想問，然而我理會：他們是路工，他們曾攀登高過雲端的峯巒：他們曾跳進千丈的深淵；　也會跋涉萬里，飽覽江南的早春，和塞北的寒冬；猛獸，冰雪，奔流，鮮花，……一切我認爲奇罕的，他們也許看得平淡了。我終於抑壓下幼稚的想念，掉轉了話題：</p>
<p>「瀑布瀉下，恍若天際銀河似的皎潔，藤蔓叢生的巖崖，猶如新婚者披上彩紗。做路工不但對祖國有貢獻，自己也頗多奇遇的啊。可惜我沒有臂力。」</p>
<p>「哈…哈……他話沒出口，一陣笑聲又引動了後面兩個路工來追問。</p>
<p>「笑什麽？是不是有酒喝？」</p>
<p>「不，他笑你們的氣力大哩。喂！朋友：我問你，你築了多少路？你走過多少路？」我以這樣打趣的笑臉搶着回答，又以這樣嚴正的態度搶先發問·</p>
<p>「我築了兩年四個月，經過八行省。掘過戰壕，也挖過坦克車的陷阱。」</p>
<p>「你的功績真不小，你可比得上陣衝鋒肉搏的戰士。」我笑着說。</p>
<p>「別太恭維人，到了潮旺莊，再請你喝酒罷。哈……」</p>
<p>他拖着幽長的笑聲，回轉身，挑着泥担走上山坡，又一鏟一鏟地揮舞着。</p>
<p>汗珠撒上泥土，空曠裏又揚起了謳歌：——</p>
<p>一根扁担挑呀，不分寒和暑；</p>
<p>一把鋤頭鏟呀，不論雨和晴；</p>
<p>嗨唷呵喲……呵喲嗨唷！</p>
<p>築了一程又一程，努力完成民族復興的使命！</p>
<p>我望着他們的背影，我聽着他們自由謳歌，像沉醉於初春的園圃裏，四面都是蓬勃的生氣和淸香！喜悅湧上心頭，興奮地又奔上了一座山峯。</p>
<h3 id="c104">逸翮 <a href="#c104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— 蘆荻</p>
<p>雨點停駐在長空，陰霾遂吞沒了一些日子。動盪的大地上有人嘆息着生活飄颺，一如浮雲，說是會把希冀底手緊握着每一個新鮮的黎晨，又復在黃昏里嘆一口氣悄悄地鬆開，像是喜悅，又復悲哀！</p>
<p>當我偶而帶着幼稚的心憂鬱地思索淸人生的時候，這滴難以褪色的痕跡縈繞在我的想像中很久，一個喟然是輕微地落在我的心頭上，然而，在眼瞳裏我終於織出了另一幅美麗的圖畫。。誰又不呢，在寒風蕭蕭，雨絲斜落中，會見陽光閃爍而跳躍歡呼，如我們童年時的嘹亮的聲浪：「歐啊，白日鳴角，風雨敗北，嘆啊……」</p>
<p>有一天，風雨是會猛烈地來臨的，風雨中，號角亦將聲聲高鳴……</p>
<p>而此刻正如在歧路上，我恍惚又聽見秋風的低訴。想着：歹土下，路旁的梧桐消瘦了呢，跟着消瘦的該是「旅人底心」，……</p>
<p>歧路上，我的脚步是艱澀地停滯了的；　一縷零雜的思潮搗混了我如水中投石，我會渴慕着遠方歡笑的生活，爲了一個鐵的信念，而一絲懦怯的心情又復纏繞着我，掀起了我眷戀此地風土之情；　陰霾的日子眞使我亦竟有一個憧憬，一點羞愧了！而幾日前，從那被稱爲王冠的角落里，一個友人却寄來這樣的話：</p>
<p>「……在這兒，日子陰霏，飄搖正是依然，一縷悔意如幽靈永遠在我面前幌動，我懊惱着離開你們匍伏在這裏，看幾日來，又是「山雨欲來風滿樓之概』，而我却仍像蔓籐般無聲息地渾噩着，你說，誰能忘記痛苦像忘記快樂那樣呢？我眞想歸去，回到你身邊和你踏着同一的步伐……</p>
<p>我開始感到了茫然，我底模糊的足跡竟還有人追羨，一縷傷感深深地指摘了我－那友人的希望該還是寫在水上的……然而，一聲鬥響，遙遠的關山外，却飄來了另一天地的鴻聲。</p>
<p>呵，我剖開了。－</p>
<p>「…藍天裏，浩刧在這裏是不時看到的，但濛烟中，我們的眼並不潤濕。知不？自由是要用血肉換來的，沒有什麼便宜可塌。說是關山萬里的阻隔吧，你總還當聽到我們胸間的跳動如樹根在夏夜裏震動泥土：看濂亦將雄姿英發，飛馳長空，這裏一切悠傷壯麗如貫虹，你當該奮翼躍起，像騰般飛來和我們呼吸着同一的呼吸，我們正帶着祝福的心懷念着你呢……』</p>
<p>看着信，又推開窗遙望着遼遠的雲山，一個想像多深啊：「逸翮凌雲漢，高姿傲雪霜。」那情景是迅速地會見到的。拿出白紙，我激動地提起了筆！……」</p>
<p>「…像你我，這裏是同樣地沒有留戀的，然而，你却願和我踏着同一步伐了，—好，飛起來吧！到濂那沒有寂寞的地方去…馳驅，衝擊，永遠都應當這樣的…捧着鐵底信念的心，朝着那血的標幟。祝福我們，讓我們亦和他們呼吸着同一的呼吸吧……」</p>
<h3 id="c105">黎明 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 品品</p>
<p>在我的一生中，使我最感動的一個景象，是黎明。我差不多只有見過這麼一個黎明，我很貪睡，黎明常常等不了我。</p>
<p>昨夜去看宿在校舍裏的一個朋友。留下，過了一宵，眞不慣，四點半醒了，一個人走到校園裏去。</p>
<p>夢裏依稀聽見的鷄聲，現在更淸脆了。鷄啼是好朕兆，概是一個晴天。平靜，然而不是黑夜的死寂。有兩三片早落的葉子在泥地上醒了，輕輕跳動，逢到露珠不走了。想洗浴？正好，天上已射下薄薄的熱氣，不會受冷的。草一定做着了快樂的夢，不然那有這樣起勁？大樹還是挺神氣似地站着，原來是一隊儀仗兵，等候黎明的駕到。</p>
<p>盡頭是一條河，河中可以瞧得見黎明。水不帶一點混濁，反而閃閃發光，還非常幽靜地響着。鳥陪着水唱，唧唧喳喳：「這人啊，一定在等黎明。」</p>
<p>我憶起了華茲華斯五句小詩：</p>
<p>鷄在啼，水在流，小鳥啁啾，湖閃閃，綠野光下未醒。</p>
<p>光！我看見黎明了！雲翳中紛紛穿出光，金色的，淺紅的，蛋白的，織成一條錦，通上天門。太空展開了像巨人的胸，眞嚇壞了小鳥啾啾，飛了。一切蓋着光彩，明亮，像新琢的寳石。雄偉，敞大，浩瀚，新鮮，光！無比的光！我用什麽贊美你？我張臂在奔，眼裏燃火，我覺得我的靈魂一同與陽光昇了起來。</p>
<p>黎明，光的創造者，你才是人類的福音！多少人在黑暗裏受苦，這一來，魔影逃散，人得救了。黎明，至尊的黎明，你是解放者，你是我們的。</p>
<p>漫漫長夜總要過去，醒吧，睡着的人，我們的黎明已把光明裝上飛車要來了！</p>
<h3 id="c106">害人之大敵 <a href="#c106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— （M.Chin.15）</p>
<p>荷屬東印度政府醫師Van　der　Heyden之報告書中有言曰：「勞動羣衆之在南洋，其中多數一若染有懶惰病者，其故安在？曰染有瘴毒氣Mal'aria也。此實為一重要問題，政府應有以改善之。」誠然，當瘴氣之侵入一苦力時，則其工作効率，當不及其身體健全時之高也。然不僅荷屬東印度一地之苦力如此，卽如熱帶之地英屬東印度與南美洲等地苦力，亦皆莫不如此也。</p>
<p>印度Dr.Hariharam醫生有言：「在一種植園內，平時須用二百工人者，若一旦有瘴毒發生，則必須增用三百工人而後可。」又據Dr.H.G.S.Morin醫生言：「卽法屬之越南，亦須如此。」兩位醫生，同一結論，然則瘴毒之烈，於此可知矣！</p>
<p>故在熱帶之地經營，若不常預防瘴毒於事前，敢信其營業興旺，必非別地敵手。</p>
<p>當一九二三年時，俄境嘗發生瘴毒症甚烈，全國工人，因染是症而不能工作者，竟達一一二·五〇〇·〇〇〇日工。在意大利而言，工人每年因染瘴毒而不能工作者，平均達一〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇日工，因瘴毒而輟耕之地達二千萬英畝；職是之故，意政府乃於各通衢遍貼警語，令民防範，謂瘴毒之害人，一若章魚（百爪魚）之吮人膏血，貪求無厭者，其喻亦可謂恰切易。</p>
<p>國聯防疫會自根據各方之報吿書後，以瘴毒實為霄人之大敵，曾勸告居民，謂防範之法，欲簡便而經濟者，莫若服以金雞納Quinine矣。蓋患是症者，若服金雞納以後，其病自必不能延長也。服之之法，患病時每日須服十五至十八厘左右，如是越五日或一星期後，病必痊可。若不幸將來再染是症時，則又如前法服之，其病必退，固無須徒事顧慮也。然平時欲防範于未然，或當天氣惡劣時，欲保持其身體健康者，則須服以金雞納六厘；如是，則瘴毒雖烈，亦不能為害也。</p>

<p>— 王其</p>
<p>葛璐琪安Gloria　Jean，（编者按：如譯作葛麗琴，喚起來不更順口麼？）這名字對于上海人的印象，可以說毫無，因爲僅有一面之緣而已。但是在好萊塢的光芒，却駕乎任何童星之上。當她處女作「乳鶯出谷」（南京將映）在Strand大戲院作世界獻映時的盛况，可說是空前，戲院的客滿，不用提起：就是當她在戲院門口時，竟有三部汽車的頂被人踏壞，爲的是爭看她的廬山眞面呀！</p>
<p>葛璐麗琪安，這是她的芳名，姓史可瑙佛，生在紐的省的白佛羅地方。至于她的歌喉，即使狄娜竇萍也有些望塵莫及，雖然同是唱高音的，但是狄的歌是高音的小調，而她的歌却是高音的正宗。</p>
<p>至于她的歌唱歷史，却也不短，在十五個月大的時候，她已經能唱「Little　AnnieRooney」全曲了，三歲半已是無綫電的歌唱明星了，五歲時她的歌喉已足够演舞台歌劇了。這種歌唱的天才，眞是得天獨厚。</p>
<p>她今年十一歲，身高四呎十一吋，體重六十五磅，碧眼棕髮。至于「乳鶯出谷」，除了這位小歌后外，有「柔腸九迥」的導演李却華電史導演，由「三朶花」的主角羅勃脫克明與南葛蘭主演，環球公司出品。</p>

<p>— 鄒嘯</p>
<p>我在六七年前就認識石靈了。那時我正在編輯一種刊物，石靈投來一篇小說是寫農民生活的，寫得很深刻，嚴肅而且凄苦。</p>
<p>去年石靈在文藝寫作方面更加努力，一方面用筆名寫通俗小說，刊登譯報，一方面大量地閱覽通俗文學作品和理論</p>
<p>但是他最努力的却是戲劇。他創作了獨幕劇，「我們放開恩怨」，他編成了「第一年的戲劇部份，他翻譯了易卜生的「鮑志遠」在文藝新潮上發表最近他又有五幕劇「桃花夢」在辣斐劇塲上演此劇原名「當他們夢醒的時候」，（這題日使人聯想到易卜生的「常死人復活的時候」劇本由世界書局出版</p>
<p>今天我在大街上看見石靈，他問起我對於「桃花夢」的意見。</p>
<p>「雷雨型的戲劇，在陳西禾的沉淵以後，又有你這一種了」。我說。</p>
<p>「不，我的主要目的不在家庭方面，而是在於牠的背景。就是說二十年前的靑島。也就是說，誰造成這種罪惡的。」他說。</p>
<p>「對了」，我說：「你的含義很微妙，大的一個時代有一個時代的文體，你也只能這樣寫了。我常想到俄國陀羅雪微支的東方寓言集，大的現在的上海文藝也許要漸漸地走向寓言的路上去了吧？你的獨幕劇就是與你的近作手法不同的」。</p>
<p>我們會心地微笑，握手分別，我遙望着一個頎長而堅實的身軀在鬧市中消失。</p>

<p>吳素秋二次登壹，大受滬地人仕歡迎，加以臨別紀念，賣座之盛，雖王玉蓉以老供奉相護，猶未必能駕而上之，素秋容貌秀麗，身段適中，爲近今坤角之允。余連觀兩日，皆應友人之的，非爲捧塲而去，區區小卒，本亦不够捧人，即欲一捧，而人亦不我識也。然兩日得觀三齣，正自慶幸，惜戲碼如紡棉花，盤絲洞，人面桃花，皆介於新舊之間，不能顯其眞實功夫，是爲憾事。紡棉花得見本來面目，唱詞中以仿四大名旦之五花洞及小翠花之大補缸最爲精彩，自拉自唱，琴音略覺生澀，或係初學；歌唱，則委婉動聽，故始終彩聲不絕。盤絲洞舞態輕盈，唱句頂眞，尙稱滿意。總之素秋之表情神韻，無一不合上海人之胃口，宜其一唱而紅也。李多奎爲當今老旦僅有之材，惟唱不及龔之厚，做不及龔之重，是亦限於天賦，所恨觀衆聲音嘈雜，有如茶室，以李之充沛，猶不能淸聽，豈觀衆程度不齊，一至於此。梁慧超可以手足敏捷，身段活潑八字概之，觀其路數，宜專從短打加工，他日不難獨樹一幟。陳少霖祗唱盜魂鈴，出塲數句，再加自拉自唱兩折，最後寫臨別紀念四字，將四字橫倒起筆，及堅起一看，則成左手反字，可謂別開生面，唱既不多，出臺只此一塲，未免太便宜。昨晚唱烏盆計，自服毒搖板及抓一把數句，頗見精彩，大段二簧平穩無疵，孫盛武之張別古，演來恰到好處。壓軸爲素秋之人面桃花，頗能表出女兒之內心私情，唱詞十段，頗多新腔，惟病中所唱之四平調，不能纏綿悱惻，如畹華生死恨中之哀感動人也。素秋宜飾小家碧玉，玲瓏活潑，人面桃花正合身分，故演來自成傑作。演至第三塲時，常衆畫「籬畔秋色」著色菊花一枝，疎落有致，由虞洽卿氏登臺演說開始競賣，由七十五元而一百二百，最後爲張君以四百元最高價得標。又胡耀庭君曾出價至一百十元，雖未得標，亦自願助入難民救濟會，（編者按：素秋凝繪扇一把贈胡，表示謝意。）素秋及張胡二君為難民造福，誠不淺矣。余對更新當局供獻意見兩點：（一）女招待之領示坐位及加開水等招待，應格外周到，（二）呌賣食品等，在休息五分鐘外，應絕對禁止，庶不至妨看客之視聽耳。</p>

<p>Declaration of the Conference</p>

Regarding the relief and resettlement of the affected compatriots and the education and care of the families of military personnel, proposals have been made to urge the government to implement them. At the opening of the conference, the President gave detailed instructions, which further confirmed the principle that the War of Resistance is consistent with world security. The discussions of the conference over the past week have focused on accelerating the laying of the foundation for national reconstruction, and it is hoped that the compatriots will wholeheartedly consider from the long-term foundation of national establishment, and exert all the thoughts and talents of the country to promote the work of national reconstruction. Secondly, the declaration discusses the current priorities: (1) The revolutionary mission of our party is to save the country and build the nation, in order to seek national independence and equality. The national policy of resistance was determined at the Fifth National Congress in the twenty-fourth year, with ten declarations, which are the political program of our party and the goals of resistance and nation-building. The first is to promote morality to invigorate the people's hearts; the second is to promote practical learning to lay the foundation of the country; the third is to promote education to cultivate the people's strength; the fourth is to enrich the economy to benefit the people's livelihood; the fifth is to carefully examine personnel and strictly evaluate performance to establish the foundation of the state's employment and administration; the sixth is to respect the judiciary and lighten litigation to protect the people's lives and property rights; the seventh is to emphasize supervision and encourage censors to rectify officialdom and extend public opinion; the eighth is to value border administration and promote education to strengthen the nation and achieve unification; the ninth is to open constitutional rule and reform internal affairs to establish the foundation of the country; the tenth is to strictly abide by the late Premier's teachings, restore national self-reliance, establish proper foreign relations, maintain the dignity of national equality and independence, and achieve the goal of world harmony. This meeting specifically mentioned this article to remind the entire party to pay attention. This general draft has already been determined, and it is hoped that all compatriots across the country will abide by it. (2) The most important resolution of this meeting internally is to schedule the convocation of the National Assembly and to accelerate the promotion of county-level construction. This conference has resolved to convene the National Assembly in 1940 in order to formulate a constitution as soon as possible. During this period, it is hoped that the people of the country will work together to achieve victory in the War of Resistance, to protect the country's independence, freedom, and equality, and to protect the freedom and interests of all individuals. This year, in February, the Central Government promulgated the Outline of Organizations at All Levels of the County, and this conference believes that this bill is a true guarantee for the implementation of constitutional government and a necessary path for China to become a modern country. It is hoped that the entire country will promote it. (3) Regarding the War of Resistance, the President has clearly indicated in his opening speech that it has been unanimously accepted by the whole country. Finally, he expressed gratitude for the assistance and relief of refugees from various countries, and hoped that all peace-loving forces in the world will work together to establish a collective security organization. He ended by mentioning the increasing difficulties and responsibilities in the future, which must be bravely shouldered. Materials should be contributed in unison, and intelligence and skills should be used well to increase production. Everyone must adhere to the creed of the nation above all and the nation above all, and the people themselves must cultivate morality, righteousness, integrity, and shame, in order to clarify the distinction between right and wrong. The people must be responsible to the country and abide by discipline. All my compatriots, may you be diligent and courageous in fulfilling your duties. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese Troops Advancing North from Qinzhou Encounter Increasingly Fierce Resistance from Chinese Forces; Front-Line Positions of Chinese Forces are Solid; Reports of Japanese Troops Reaching Datang are Inaccurate <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – Several days have passed since the Japanese troops landed in Qinzhou Bay west of Beihai. The purpose of the Japanese offensive has not been determined. Nanning seems to be the objective of the Japanese offensive, as it is the transportation hub of Guangxi Province. The Japanese troops advancing north from Qinzhou, along the mountainous border between Guangxi and Guangdong provinces, are not far from the foothills. However, the deeper the troops penetrate inland, the fiercer the resistance they encounter from Chinese forces. It is impossible for them to make a swift advance. (20th Huitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to a Central News Agency report today, two squadrons of Japanese aircraft attacked Nanning yesterday. Japanese planes appeared over Nanning at 3:00 PM yesterday, dropping several tons of heavy bombs and incendiary bombs. According to Chinese reports, the Japanese army currently has 2,000 troops stationed in Fangcheng and Qinzhou, while the main force is advancing along the highway to Nanning. During the heavy rains of the past two days, the military position of the Chinese Southern Front has been solidified. (20th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to sources here today, Japanese troops landed again yesterday at several locations near Beihai, a few miles away. However, details are currently unknown. According to a South China correspondent for the Ta Kung Pao, Japanese troops have not reached Datang, which is fifty miles away from Nanning. The Japanese propaganda is completely inaccurate, and the Japanese advance is not from Qinzhou, but directly from Fangcheng, bypassing the shortcut north. (20th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing – According to the latest military news from Guangxi, the Japanese troops invading from Qinzhou are now not far from Nanning. Military sources here say this was expected, as Nanning is only a hundred miles from Beihai. It is reported that after the Japanese troops occupied Fangcheng and Qinzhou, they launched several routes north on the morning of the 18th of this month. Their vanguard seems to have crossed the border of Guangxi Province, as there were reports last night that Japanese troops were only eight miles from the border. Thirteen Japanese planes bombed Nanning in two groups yesterday afternoon, dropping multiple strong explosive and incendiary bombs. General Bai Chongxi, Chief of the General Staff and Director of the Southwest Headquarters, is currently in Chongqing attending the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee meeting and will not return to Guilin immediately, indicating that the Chinese military commander is confident in the war situation in Guangxi Province. (20th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin – At around 8:00 AM on the 18th, the Japanese troops advancing north from Qinzhou encountered Chinese troops at Jiulongxu ("northeast of Qinzhou"), and a fierce battle ensued. Chinese troops fought bravely, and the Japanese troops abandoned corpses all over the field and retreated to Qinzhou. By noon, there were no traces of the Japanese troops around Jiulong and Niufan. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sihui – More than 300 Japanese troops from Xinping in the southwest raided Minle City at dawn on the 18th. Chinese local forces bravely fought back. After a fierce battle until noon, the Japanese troops could not withstand the attack and retreated along their original route. (20th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sihui – A squadron of Japanese troops from Sanshui scouted Huangtang and Xiaotang on the 16th, but were detected by Chinese troops who ambushed them at a certain location. When the Japanese troops approached, they suddenly attacked, killing or wounding more than a hundred Japanese soldiers and seizing many guns. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e3">Italy's Attitude Towards the Balkans <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>It has been a long time since we heard Mussolini's roar. Since the outbreak of World War II, Mussolini has remained neutral and impartial. The German explanation is that Italy's actions make it difficult for Britain and France to understand Italy's attitude, which is more beneficial to Germany. This is just a German excuse. In fact, Italy and Germany have long been out of alignment and are no longer bound by Germany. Of course, it cannot be said that Italy has turned to be pro-British and pro-French, but it wants to make a good deal out of the European war. Italy occupies an important position in the Mediterranean. Not only Germany has a need to rely on it, but Britain and France have also repeatedly tried to please it, so Italy takes advantage of its rarity and values itself. Of course, Italy's current relationship with Britain and France is no longer as contradictory as before. The withdrawal of Italian border troops from the French border and the re-appointment of Bascianini as the British ambassador indicate his friendly attitude towards Britain and France. However, this does not mean that he has given up his demands on Britain and France. Italy's inability to forget the French territories in the Mediterranean and North Africa can still be seen in the Italian newspaper Gazzetta del Popolo. Gazzetta recently said: "Italy expects the colonial problem to be resolved. Italy was sold by the Treaty of Versailles. The treaty did not give Italy any colonies. Italy's goal is the political and economic harmony of the Balkan countries, and the free and equal resolution of colonial issues. Prime Minister Mussolini's calm but armed peaceful policy is based on waiting and guarding." "Waiting and guarding" can really represent Italy's basic policy at present. The content of this statement is naturally not only addressed to Britain and France, but also to Germany and the Soviet Union. What is demanded from the former is naturally the colonial issue. The slogans of Nice, Corsica, and Tunisia have already given France a great impression. When Mussolini delivered an armed peace speech to tens of thousands of people on the balcony of the Palazzo Venezia in Rome this time, students shouted this slogan again. Even if it did not get a response from the crowd, an Italian observer stated that he has not given up his desire for French territories in the Mediterranean and North Africa, which shows that Italy is only waiting for an opportunity. As for now, he prefers to wait and see, because during the period when the two sides on the Western Front are facing each other without a clear winner, from Italy's standpoint, it is inconvenient to act rashly and lightly give up its neutral position that can influence the overall situation. This is one. With the status of a neutral country, it develops its foreign trade with both sides. Since the beginning of the war, it has been flourishing. Its newly opened air route has also passed through the Italian port of Naples and reached Australia via Dutch India. His commercial ships sailing to the East are crowded with passengers every time they depart, and the fare has increased by 50%. Undoubtedly, if Italy does not engage in war, it can gain a lot of benefits in trade and make it prosperous for a period of time. This is two.</p>
<p>However, Italy does not wait and see regarding the Balkan Peninsula. It has repeatedly stated that "Italy will not allow the Bolshevik Soviet Union to cross the Carpathian Mountains (on the former Czech border) and enter the Danube River basin, or sneak into the Mediterranean from the Balkans," and said that "The Communist Party hopes to use the revolutions of other countries to expand its power in the Balkans, then it is bound to conflict with Mussolini's doctrine and the Italian army." This shows that the Soviet Union is not allowed to interfere in the Balkan Peninsula. This kind of argument is better aimed at Germany than at the Soviet Union. Although Germany and Italy form an axis, their past interests in Central Europe and the Balkans have been conflicting. The formation of Hungary as a German vassal state and the inclusion of Austria into German territory are countries that Italy has historically regarded as its sphere of influence. Since the signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact, Germany has become the nominal leader, and Italian diplomacy has followed Berlin's lead. All of Italy's interests in Central Europe have been invisibly deprived and encroached upon by Germany. This is something that Mussolini feels aggrieved and has no way to complain about. Now that Germany is close to the Soviet Union and is using all its strength to deal with Britain and France, it has no time to take care of the Balkans. Mussolini naturally believes that this is an excellent opportunity to restore Italy's position in the Balkans, so he uses the name of anti-communism to achieve his goal. Mussolini's loud call to prevent the Soviet Union from invading the Balkans is this kind of effect. As for how Italy will concretely launch its efforts in the Balkans, it probably has to wait until the European war reaches the second stage before it can be seen in real development!</p>

<p>Luoyang – (Delayed) The Japanese Abe Independent Mixed Brigade sent troops from the Qiancun, Lüchuan, and Morita units, totaling 5,000-6,000, to attack south from Laiyuan in northwestern Hebei on the 3rd of this month. The Chinese army utilized the terrain, resolutely resisting on one side and sending strong forces to flank the Japanese from behind. After a day of fierce fighting, with dozens of hand-to-hand combats, the Japanese Qiancun units were almost completely annihilated. On the 4th, Japanese Brigade Commander Lieutenant General Abe Norihide personally led a portion of his troops to reinforce, but was again lured into the deep mountains by the Chinese army, heavily surrounded, and fiercely attacked. By noon, most of the Japanese troops had been annihilated, and Japanese General Abe was killed on the spot. Except for a portion of the remaining Japanese troops fleeing, the rest were annihilated. Japanese corpses were scattered throughout the valleys, and blood flowed like a river. The Chinese seized countless weapons, ammunition, and military supplies, which are being inventoried. Hirata Shun, the Japanese commander stationed in Beiping, upon hearing the news, urgently dispatched the Sangmu Division's Xinmei and Liuchuan infantry regiments, and the cavalry regiment of Tanabe from Yixian, Juxian, and Tangxian to Laiyuan to reinforce. Two of the regiments were intercepted by the Chinese army in Dafenggou, Jifang, and other places. The fighting continued until the morning of the 9th. By the time all of the Japanese troops arrived, the Chinese army had safely retreated. Lieutenant General Abe Norihide was from Aomori Prefecture, Japan, and graduated from the 19th class of the Military Academy. He served as a regimental commander, brigade commander, and independent brigade commander. He was known as a tactical expert and was one of the outstanding Japanese military commanders. He was promoted to lieutenant general on the 2nd of last month, and was killed by Chinese soldiers just over a month later. The Japanese army was shocked upon hearing the news. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Japanese Army's Attack on Northern Hubei and Northern Hunan Fails: Circumstances of the Failure; Strategic Errors Lead to Incomplete Success; Greater Losses Expected Afterwards; Interview of a Foreign Advisor with an American Reporter <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing – A certain foreign advisor to the Chinese Central Army recently stated in an interview with an Associated Press reporter that the Japanese army’s recent offensives in China were akin to “forcing ignorant children to perform the work of adults,” causing the two Japanese invasions (of Northern Hubei and Northern Hunan) this year to end in incomplete success. Observing the future, the Japanese army will clearly suffer even heavier losses. This foreign advisor explained the Japanese army's strategy during the invasion of Changsha, saying that the Japanese army used a force of five divisions, but without the support of artillery regiments and tanks. Their front line stretched from east of Dongting Lake to Nanchang, a total of 250 miles. At the same time, the Japanese army dispatched four teams to advance on separate routes, attempting to converge in the Changsha area. At that time, the Chinese army defending against the Japanese advance consisted of sixteen divisions, their numbers equal to the Japanese army, and they finally repelled the invading Japanese army. Also, in April of that year, when the Japanese army attempted to encircle the Chinese army in the Northern Hubei and Southern Henan areas, the Japanese army used most of four divisions and one cavalry brigade. At that time, the Chinese forces responsible for defending against the Japanese invasion were five elite divisions of the Guangxi Army, commanded by General Li Zongren, supplemented by well-trained mobile units and guerrillas. They also defeated the Japanese army, achieving an unprecedented victory. In these two battles, the Japanese army initially made good progress. The Japanese army advancing on Southern Henan and Northern Hubei reached Tongbai in Southern Henan at one point, which was one of the Japanese army's objectives. However, two days later, these Japanese troops finally collapsed in two directions, retreating to the south and east. At that time, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, with thousands of people abandoned on the battlefield because they could not be transported away. A Japanese regiment was trapped in the Dabie Mountain area and almost failed to break through. When the Japanese army attacked Northern Hunan, it started on September 18. Initially, three Japanese divisions, under the cover of heavy artillery and air force, tried to cross the Xinqiang River, intending to head south to Changsha. At that time, the battle was fierce. According to General Guan Linzheng, commander-in-chief of a certain Chinese army group, although the Chinese army suffered heavy attacks from the Japanese army for six days, it still stood firm. Later, because the Japanese army landed in Yingtian on the south bank of Dongting Lake, the left flank of the Chinese army felt threatened. Also, if the Japanese army's roundabout movement succeeded, the retreat route of the Chinese army fighting along the Xinqiang River would be cut off. Therefore, the Chinese army then obeyed the order of Chairman Chiang and retreated south at night, but at the same time dispatched two Chinese divisions to outflank both sides of the Japanese army's advance route. In this battle, by September 30, the Japanese army was about 20 miles away from Changsha. On October 2, after a large-scale encirclement by the Chinese army, the Japanese army finally began to collapse and retreat north. On October 7, the right flank of the Japanese army fighting along the Yuehan Railway and the left flank of the Japanese army advancing southwest from Fengxin in Northern Jiangxi were also forced to collapse. According to General Li Zongren's post-war statement, when the Japanese army entered the Chinese army's position in Northern Hubei, the Chinese army implemented a scorched earth policy, leaving only houses and trees, which finally caused the Japanese army to collapse. Also, according to foreign residents living in Changsha, when the Japanese army attacked the area, the civilians in the city had already evacuated by September 25, and the Chinese army was prepared to set fire to the remaining houses if necessary, but the Japanese army collapsed before reaching Changsha. In both of the above two major battles, when the Japanese army had its target in sight, it immediately implemented an "about face" and retreated to its original position. According to the foreign advisor, the Japanese army's situation at that time was that it had to withdraw, otherwise it was in danger of being annihilated by the Chinese army. At that time, the Chinese regular army had surrounded the forward columns of the Japanese army, and the guerrillas were attacking the Japanese army's supply base and transportation lines, causing the advancing Japanese army to lose contact and fall into a state of fighting on its own. Furthermore, because of the difficult transportation in the mountainous area and the cutoff of reinforcements, it suffered a disastrous defeat. The foreign advisor jokingly said to the reporter, "How can an ignorant child be competent for the work of an adult? When they realize that they are not competent, they have no choice but to go home." The foreign advisor's comment on the reason why the Chinese army failed to expand its original front line after winning the victory was said to be "mainly because the Chinese army lacked war materials. When the Japanese army retreated to its original position, the Japanese army defended the fortresses built last year to block the Chinese army's advance. These fortresses were Chinese old cities. Rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades can stop the Japanese army from attacking without heavy artillery, but these light weapons are not enough to destroy the fortresses. Although the Chinese army currently has 1.5 million front-line troops that can be driven, they are unwilling to make meaningless sacrifices of great manpower. Therefore, the 800,000 Japanese troops south of the Great Wall can hold a front line of 2,000 miles, occupying an area of 650,000 square miles. Although the Chinese army has cut off the Japanese army's front line in many places, the Japanese army can still continue to occupy its walled cities and continue to transport supplies and munitions to Central China via the Yangtze River, and from Tianjin and Qingdao to various parts of North China. This is because the Japanese army often relies on superior weapons." According to reports from the Chinese side, the Japanese army's recruitment of Chinese people to fight against the Chinese army together with the Japanese army has not been successful. The number of puppet troops participating in the Battle of Changsha was 18,000, and the same was true for those participating in the Battle of Northern Hubei. However, the Japanese army did not allow the puppet troops to fight independently, but only as auxiliary troops of the Japanese army. At that time, Chongqing received almost daily news of puppet troops defecting. If one-tenth of the reports received were true, then the Japanese army's attempt to use Chinese to control Chinese would undoubtedly fail. General Li Zongren once told reporters that the Chinese army's recapture of Lanfeng in Eastern Henan was due to the defection of the puppet troops. The puppet troops opened the city gates wide and invited the Chinese army into the city. Under the same circumstances, the Chinese army was able to successfully recapture cities in various places due to the defection of the puppet troops. However, the Chinese army retreated to its original position after inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese army or when Japanese reinforcements arrived, in order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices. The highest Chinese military authorities also admitted that if the Japanese army was willing to concentrate a large number of divisions in one position, the Japanese army would be quite capable of occupying any stronghold they wanted to occupy. When the Japanese army rushed from Nanchang along the Xianggan Highway to Changsha, and cooperated with the Japanese army advancing along the Xiang River to attack, the situation was particularly difficult for the Chinese army defending Changsha to hold on to. However, the Japanese army failed as a result of strategic errors. Also, the Japanese army could attack Shaanxi from Henan, and the Japanese army in the southwest could attack Nanning in Guangxi Province from Beihai, but the Japanese army's strength could not realize this hope. Minister of Military Administration He Yingqin told reporters that although the Japanese army could advance, "it would encounter extreme danger due to the insecurity of the transportation lines." He explained that the difficulties in strategy and tactics, including the mountainous terrain and the increased activity of guerrillas, were the main factors hindering the Japanese army. According to the opinions of most military observers, if Japan cannot dispatch several divisions of elite Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria and make efforts to mobilize all its troops in Japan, it will never be able to inflict a fatal blow on the Chinese army, and the Sino-Japanese war cannot be ended. This is because the Japanese army must crush the main force of the Chinese army before it can end the Sino-Japanese war. They also believe that Japan cannot implement the above steps unless Japan can sign an agreement with the Soviet Union, but even so, the Japanese Kwantung Army is still skeptical of the Soviet Union's actions and will certainly not risk dispatching the Kwantung Army to take action against China. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese war has now fallen into the stalemate that military observers had predicted a year ago. Although the Chinese army currently lacks military equipment to drive out the Japanese army in the fortress area, the Japanese army also lacks the strength to end the war of aggression against China. The sudden changes in the current international situation or the increase in anti-war sentiment in the Japanese army seem to be the only way to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute. Otherwise, unless the two countries are willing to stop the war in the current conflict and convene a conference to resolve the disputes between the two countries, Japan's so-called end to the war of aggression against China is just a dream.

Among our group, there are many veterans of the last European war. Recalling the situation 20 years ago, I can't help but be fascinated. When we visited France this time, we saw people everywhere, regardless of men, women, old or young, who were calm and determined. Since the outbreak of this war, France has not been as excited as it was during the last European war. We do not see people holding demonstrations or marching in groups, and we do not see soldiers decorating their bayonets with flowers. However, this is precisely the evidence that we know what war is based on experience. After all, fighting is not a matter of luck, and it must be dealt with calmly and practically in order to be successful. The French people have now made a decision to ensure that repeated wars of aggression never happen again. We can feel this determination everywhere we go. In short, the French people are deeply convinced that the Anglo-French Allied Forces will achieve final victory. The expeditionary force in our country is also high-spirited, and the overall morale of the officers and soldiers is very good. Their numbers are increasing day by day and will continue to be replenished in the future. Our troops have made significant progress in reinforcing defenses and improving military equipment in the defense zone. In addition, we have also visited the Maginot Line. This line is currently being defended by the most elite army in the world. Their calmness, bravery, and fully effective training cannot be matched by any country's army. The world knows that the French nation has made heavy sacrifices in finances and materials to complete this line. Today, all nations that love freedom deeply appreciate France's unbreakable line of defense and the French troops stationed there. If France had not shown a determined spirit to complete its national defense organization in recent years, it is not difficult for us to imagine what the situation of the war would be today. All civilized countries in the world have once again benefited from France's generosity. This should be written and highlighted in human history." (Havas cable on the 19th)</p>

The Don Province, as the birthplace of the army and the hometown of many of its participating soldiers, is particularly enthusiastic in its celebrations. There are liaison meetings of veterans personally led by Budyonny, mass rallies, and equestrian competitions. Today, national newspapers have published special editions commemorating the anniversary, publishing articles and photos related to the First Army. Pravda published Stalin's congratulatory message to the officers and soldiers of the army, and the order to the army from the National Defense Commissar Marshal Voroshilov on that day. Voroshilov's order stated, "The First Cavalry Army has extremely high organizational and political consciousness. The entire army is unanimously loyal to the people and the cause of the socialist revolution. It has also been forged into an excellent discipline and order in the revolutionary war, so it is invincible and has repeatedly achieved combat feats. Lenin himself paid very close attention to and valued it. The army was entirely under the command of Stalin himself from its establishment to the end of the civil war, so Stalin attached great importance to it during the civil war and still does now. The traditional spirit of the First Army permeates the entire Red Army cavalry. This point has been confirmed by the campaign to liberate the fellow countrymen oppressed by the Polish landlords in Western Ukraine and Western Belarus. In this campaign, our mechanized cavalry used lightning-fast marches, marching 100 kilometers a day, to implement raid and encirclement maneuvers to oppress and destroy the enemy, leaving them no time to rest and reorganize. This kind of initiative, along with the sophisticated cooperation of infantry and other mechanized units, as well as the spirit of bravery and boldness, is the tradition of the First Cavalry Army and the main reason why our entire Red Army is powerful and invincible."

<p>Amsterdam – Local newspapers report that a diplomatic correspondent states that Swiss-British trade negotiations in London are progressing very slowly. The issue of pre-war delivery contracts remains unresolved. The British argue that, due to changing circumstances, they cannot accept goods ordered by Britain in Switzerland before September 2nd, as Britain has placed many orders in other countries as well. Opening this precedent would be difficult for Britain to manage. The correspondent believes that Britain's refusal to accept pre-war orders will inflict a severe economic blow on Switzerland. The value of British pre-war orders from Switzerland amounts to a substantial 1.5 million pounds. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e27">British Economist Keynes Advocates Compulsory Savings System: Intended to Prevent Continued Wartime Price Increases <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>London – To cope with war expenses, the British government must make great efforts in finance. As a result, the domestic economy is bound to fall into an abnormal state. Therefore, economic experts generally believe that the government should not only raise war funds at this time, but also look ahead and consider the post-war economic situation. After all, price increases are inevitable during wartime (according to reports, British prices have risen by 6% in the first month of the war, and are expected to rise by 20% soon). Wage increases due to high prices are also unavoidable. In this vicious cycle, the government will ultimately have to implement an inflationary policy to meet urgent needs. However, the result of implementing an inflationary policy during wartime will inevitably lead to a forced contraction policy after the war. If so, all the adverse consequences will erupt after the war, just as after the last European war. Regarding this point, the famous economist Keynes recently proposed a plan advocating the implementation of a "compulsory savings system" during wartime to remedy the situation. In his view, after the implementation of this plan, it can prevent continued price increases at present and protect the national economy after the war from falling rapidly. The method is to still pay the wages of workers across the country according to the increased standard, but not to pay all of them in cash. Part of it should be transferred to the Post Office Savings Bureau, so as not to be completely spent, and at the same time, various items will not continue to rise in price due to excessive demand. In other words, although workers across the country will receive the benefit of increased wages during the war, they must not spend all of them, so that they can save part of their savings for spending after the war. In this way, after the military industry stops production after the war, various non-wartime industries can gradually recover, and because people still have savings to use, there is no need to worry that no one will buy the products of various industries at that time, and there is no need to be forced to implement a contraction policy immediately after the war. The main significance of the "compulsory savings system" lies in this. The amount of compulsory savings should be determined based on the amount of each person's income. Those with income below the minimum level are exempt from this obligation, and for those with higher incomes, the percentage should be increased proportionally. This savings should be interest-bearing at half a percent per annum, and depositors should not be allowed to withdraw this deposit before the end of the war, except for special reasons.

<p>London – According to naval sources here today, six ships were sunk in the past week, indicating that Germany's maritime offensive is beginning to become active again. The sinking of these ships is mostly due to mines, but these mines were definitely not drifting randomly into the ships' routes, but were carefully arranged beforehand. According to survivors, these mines seem to be connected in pairs by iron wires, so after one side of the ship hits a mine, the other side will inevitably hit a mine as well. In addition, there are a large number of these mines drifting at sea, some of which have drifted to the British coast. According to the British Navy, these mines are definitely not British mines, because the structure of British mines automatically loses their explosive power once they break free and drift. According to reports, six ships were sunk last week: (1) the Dutch ship Simon Bolivar; (2) the Swedish ship Borejesson; (3) the British ship Blackhill; (4) the Italian ship Grazia; (5) the Yugoslav ship Galiga Milica; (6) the Lithuanian ship Donas.

The U.S. plan is to support the various territories so that they can reach an equal status with the states of the United States. The United States has no intention of expanding colonies and will never oppress the various territories. All regions under the American flag have some degree of autonomy, such as the Philippines, which is an autonomous state, and Hawaii, which is a dependent state. As for when these regions can advance to an equal status with the Federation, this is a question that should be decided by Congress. At the same time, citizens under the American flag should enjoy the rights enjoyed by other citizens. If some regions are temporarily difficult to advance to the same status as "states," then we will also enable the people of these regions to obtain the full rights of American citizens.

Today, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in response to a reporter's question, stated that the rumor carried by the "Jiji Shinpo" newspaper regarding a Rome dispatch, claiming that Germany and the Soviet Union had concluded a secret agreement allowing German raiding ships to freely use Vladivostok, could not be confirmed at present.

<h3 id="e41">From Children's Masturbation to Adult and Female Masturbation <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>The theory that the bad habit of masturbation originates in childhood has been proven to be true by the diligent research of medical experts. When children first acquire this bad habit, it is mostly unconscious. For example, if their genitals itch, someone else touches them, or it is passed on by others, or they imitate others and engage in actions similar to masturbation, they do not feel any spiritual pleasure. Thereafter, with the increase in age and the development of the nervous system, spiritual pleasure and physiological satisfaction occur unintentionally; thus, they love and engage in conscious masturbation. Similarly, when young people read pornographic books or look at erotic pictures, their erotic feelings are unusually excited, and they involuntarily touch themselves. As a result, they ejaculate. After this strange discovery, they are bound to try a second or third time, and thus repeatedly engage in intentional masturbation. According to this, it can be known that when children first engage in masturbation, whether it is taught by others or self-discovered, it is mostly an impulsive behavior without any spiritual effect, and later becomes a conscious behavior. Therefore, the earlier masturbation occurs in childhood, the greater the harm, because the weak nerves suddenly encounter this powerful stimulation, just like tender young buds encountering the devastation of a storm, and few do not decline and wither.</p>
<p>As for female masturbation, although its harm is not as severe as that of men, prolonged indulgence can cause hypertrophy of the labia and problems with the uterus. Spiritually, it can be said that they completely lose the beauty of virginity. Therefore, most of these women will inevitably become depraved in the future. In short, masturbation, regardless of the period, or male or female, can cause neurasthenia. In men, it can cause kidney deficiency, premature ejaculation, nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, pale complexion, weak limbs, tinnitus, headache, and a variety of diseases. Therefore, when children's puberty begins, they should be properly restrained and not allowed to be licentious. If masturbation has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, they should take the German "Biokosmetika" preparation for men, "Körperkraft," which can produce semen, replenish blood, strengthen the brain, and strengthen the kidneys after 24 hours. The ingredients of "Körperkraft" are entirely extracted from the testicles of strong animals, using scientific methods to extract its essence, and mixed with mineral and plant ingredients that are beneficial to the human body. It has the functions of nourishing the brain, nourishing the kidneys, and replenishing blood. Elderly people who take this in winter have the effect of returning to youth. The female "Körperkraft" functions to regulate menstruation and promote fertility, and is a good medicine for gynecology.</p>

<p>— Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>At this time of year, when it is cold, it is easy to catch a cold with the slightest negligence. However, many people regard colds as a minor illness, not worth mentioning, and mostly use ordinary cough medicine as a perfunctory treatment, not knowing that a big mistake has already been made here. When the symptoms become severe, they take apricot kernels and syrup, but the symptoms still do not subside. They are still reluctant to part with these medicines, thus prolonging the time to heal, and ultimately inducing disease. Acute cases become pneumonia, and the disease is critical. If the treatment is not careful, they will lose their lives. Even if they are lucky enough to survive, their bodies become weak and susceptible to tuberculosis, resulting in pulmonary tuberculosis. Even if they do not die, the recuperation takes time, at least three or four years to fully recover, and whether they can avoid recurrence in the future is still unknown. As for cases with severe symptoms, even if they are lucky enough to be cured, it will take at least five to eight years, and the loss of money is even incalculable. It is essential to deal with this in advance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, based on my many years of clinical experience, there are many cases where dangerous lung diseases are induced by colds and coughs, which is very regrettable. Coughing is most likely to shake the lungs. This action makes the lungs uneasy. If a person has a history of tuberculosis, there is a nineteen out of ten chance of developing tuberculosis. There was a Mr. Weng Xinian from Jintan, whose two elder brothers both died of lung disease, at the ages of twenty to thirty. Last fall, he caught a cold while bathing, and coughed frequently. He took cough suppressants, but not only did the cough not stop, but the sputum turned yellow, his voice became hoarse, and he had night sweats. His family feared that he would develop tuberculosis, repeating the fate of his two brothers. He asked me for treatment, and I quickly prescribed the sacred medicine for lung disease, "Pulmotone." After taking it, the cough stopped within three hours, and at the same time, his appetite was greatly stimulated. In less than two weeks, the cough had subsided, and his body was strong, with no signs of illness. Since then, Mr. Weng has regarded "Pulmotone" as a life-saving treasure. From then on, whenever anyone in his family had a cough, they would take "Pulmotone," and all would recover completely. An ideal</p>

<p>From the new trends in gonorrhea treatment in modern Europe and the United States, European countries, in view of the increasing prevalence of gonorrhea, have launched a general mobilization of the European medical community, organizing anti-gonorrhea groups. According to news from the Science News Service, they have established more than sixty groups in two years, re-examining the failures of past general chemical therapies and transmembrane sterilization therapies, and realizing that these therapies have failed to meet the necessary conditions for killing gonococcus. Finally, the drug "Klimanon," invented by Dr. Peter in Germany, can be described as a completely effective drug for gonorrhea, and the problem of gonorrhea being difficult to treat can also be solved! After taking "Klimanon," the sterilization is extremely powerful, without any adverse reactions. Therefore, for all gonorrhea, regardless of whether it is acute or chronic, the sterilization occurs precisely at the site of the disease, without the shortcomings of being excessive or insufficient. In my decades of experience, among oral medications, "Klimanon" is the most outstanding. Therefore, all major venereal disease hospitals in Europe and the United States regard "Klimanon" as the only ideal and effective drug for conquering gonorrhea.</p>
<h3 id="e44">Case of Cured Nocturnal Emission <a href="#e44" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c44" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">44</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine, Germany</p>
<p>Treatment of spermatorrhea</p>
<p>Patient Tang Lianqing, from Wuxi, age 23. (Complaint) - In childhood, he was harmed by his companions, often playing with his genitals for pleasure. At the age of seventeen, he had nocturnal emissions. Due to financial difficulties, he did not seek treatment. However, at this time, he had stopped masturbating, but the nocturnal emissions became more frequent day by day, and he suffered from insomnia, forgetfulness, weakened brain, headaches, etc. His memory was greatly reduced and he often felt mentally exhausted. Although he took tonics, they had no effect. Last spring, he was stimulated and visited a prostitute once. A few days later, he suddenly developed gonorrhea, but fortunately he sought treatment quickly and recovered. After that, he developed spermatorrhea. He ejaculated unconsciously at night, and during the day, if he was close to women, semen would leak out naturally. I was very panicked and didn't know what to do. Fortunately, I saw a report and came to seek treatment. (Treatment process) - I ordered him to strictly observe hygiene and prescribed "Nervosan Emission Pills" to stop his emissions and spermatorrhea, and also gave him a large amount of "Körperkraft" to replenish his deficiencies. Mr. Tang followed my advice, and after a week, he had no more emissions. After taking it for two months, he felt much better, slept soundly at night, his mind became clear, and he gained twelve pounds.</p>

<h3 id="e45">Gonorrhea's Disgusting Symptoms <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>— Selected by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Gonorrhea has a particularly unpleasant impression, which is the discharge in the chronic stage of gonorrhea. However, patients also have a misconception about the discharge, thinking that the discharge has stopped, indicating that their gonorrhea has been completely cured. Little do they know that this view is also unreliable. Because gonorrhea cannot be considered cured simply because the urine becomes clear. Originally, gonococcus is extremely small, and cannot be observed with the naked eye. Generally, after gonorrhea has passed the acute phase, the secretions gradually decrease. But this cannot be regarded as a sign that gonorrhea is gradually healing. In fact, this is a change in gonorrhea, that is, the gonococcus takes advantage of our negligence to lurk deep inside, waiting for an opportunity to move. Whenever the patient moves, or occasionally has sexual intercourse, the urine turns turbid again, and the discharge changes from dripping to floating flocs. In this way, the disease progresses from shallow to deep, causing chronic prostatitis, orchitis, seminal vesiculitis, and cystitis. Patients waste their time and opportunities.</p>
<p>Now, to eliminate this stubborn gonorrhea, it must be thoroughly treated. The policy of eliminating all toxins must be implemented. If we still harbor complacency and treat it as it flares up, or rely on localized surgical treatments that are as confusing as a "maze," we will absolutely not be able to shake the roots of the gonococcus. Because general localized surgical treatments only reach the urethra, and inferior drugs on the market have no curative effect at all. Based on my twenty years of experience, I know that to eliminate discharge and gonococcus, one must use German electrotherapy, WettererX therapy, and anti-gonorrhea serum. Internally, one must take the gonorrhea-specific drug "Klimanon" to fundamentally eliminate the gonococcus in the wide and deep areas. In this way, the disgusting discharge caused by the gonococcus can naturally disappear, and once cured, it will never recur. Clinic hours are from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Starting today, 20 patients will be seen each day. Each number will only receive a "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e46">Despite His Arduous Journey, the US Ambassador Still Looked Refreshed; Arrived in Shanghai Last Night; After Disembarking, He Took a Speedboat Directly to the Flagship; Visited Huddle for Two Hours; The Ambassador Only Went Ashore at Midnight This Morning <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>After returning to China to resume his post, US Ambassador to China Johnson went directly to Chongqing to meet with the central authorities, including Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Foreign Minister Wang. After that, he flew to Hong Kong and boarded the President Coolidge on the 18th, arriving in Shanghai at 9 p.m. last night. The ship docked at buoys 11 and 12. The ambassador then transferred to the naval speedboat "USS Isabel" and boarded the US flagship "USS Augusta" to meet with Admiral Huddle for a conversation lasting more than two hours. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>US Consulate Took a Ship to Greet Him</p>
<p>A reporter from this newspaper went to the Customs Wharf at 9 p.m. last night. At that time, US Consul General to Shanghai Gauss and Lockhart were taking a speedboat to the President Coolidge to greet Ambassador Johnson. After Gauss and Lockhart boarded the ship to meet with the ambassador, they accompanied the ambassador on the USS Isabel directly to the USS Augusta in the Huangpu River to meet with Admiral Huddle, Commander-in-Chief of the US Far East Naval Forces.</p>
<p>Accompanied to the Flagship to Visit Huddle</p>
<p>Admiral Huddle personally welcomed him on deck. After shaking hands with the ambassador, they entered the cabin and began their conversation. Only Ambassador Johnson, Admiral Huddle, and Consul General Gauss participated. The content of the conversation is unknown, but it is widely believed that, in addition to exchanging pleasantries, it must have been related to the US strengthening its power in the Far East and recent developments in the Far East. The conversation lasted until midnight.</p>
<p>Went Ashore This Morning and Lodged at the Cathay Hotel</p>
<p>After the important conversation between the ambassador and Admiral Huddle ended, he took the USS Isabel speedboat away from the flagship and went directly to the Customs Wharf. At that time, Chinese police officers sent by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department were on duty at the wharf. The ambassador, accompanied by Consul General Gauss, went ashore in the light rain at 12:10 a.m. this morning, without any attendants. The ambassador was as refreshed as ever and in high spirits, wearing a light-colored coat and holding a cane. His short beard showed a slight white color. He then boarded special car number 4 and went to the Cathay Hotel with Mr. Gauss for a rest.</p>
<p>Consulate Arranged a Special Room</p>
<p>The US Consulate General prepared a special room for the ambassador's use during his stay in Shanghai, which was completed yesterday morning. The ambassador had been staying in Chongqing, the wartime capital of China, for five months after returning to China from Washington. It is not known how long he will stay in Shanghai this time.</p>
<p>Met with the French Ambassador in Hong Kong</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 16th, the ambassador, accompanied by Deputy Consul Lai Fang, flew from Chongqing to Hong Kong on a China National Aviation Corporation Douglas DC-3 aircraft. He then stayed at a friend's house. It is said that the ambassador met with French Ambassador Cosme at the Guomin Hotel in Causeway Bay on the 17th.</p>
<p>Deeply Sympathetic to China's Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>Ambassador Johnson arrived in Shanghai on the morning of May 24 this year, with his family, aboard the President Coolidge from San Francisco, USA, and then transferred to Chongqing to resume his post. He stayed in Shanghai for a week, meeting with British Ambassador Kerr and French Ambassador Cosme to reminisce about the past. He then left Shanghai on the Canadian Empress on June 1 and went to Hong Kong and Chongqing to meet with Chairman Lin, Chairman Chiang, and Foreign Minister Wang to report on his resumption of duty. During his stay in Chongqing, the ambassador expressed great concern about China's resistance against Japan. At a reception hosted by Madame Chiang Kai-shek, he donated 180 yuan in national currency to fund winter clothing for the soldiers at the front. The ambassador stayed in Chongqing for about five months.</p>
<p>No News of Peace Issues</p>
<p>According to the ambassador, during his stay in Chongqing, he had never heard of any peace issues. The ambassador praised the construction of the Burma Road and the Kunming Highway, saying that the completion of the road would be an important route for China to the outside world, and praised it as a modern highway. He himself was very comfortable living in Chongqing and did not feel short of food.</p>
<p>Considers China His Second Home</p>
<p>The ambassador has been in China for nearly 30 years. His first visit to China was when he was nearly 20 years old. According to the ambassador, before returning to China on May 5 this year, he stated on a shortwave radio broadcast near the Golden Gate Exposition on Treasure Island in San Francisco, "I regard China as my second home, a place where my life and spirit are entrusted." And he shouted loudly, "Hey, tell my friends in , that the ambassador used the power of broadcasting to specifically inform Dr. Pike, a key US diplomatic official in China, Goss, the US Consul in Shanghai, and Raukhtut, the US Consul in Beiping. He hoped to use the time to China. The ambassador further stated that he hoped to stay in China forever. He loved China because China was the oldest and most civilized country in the Far East."</p>

<p>In recent times, the power of the Chinese Air Force has not only been evident on the front lines and at important locations in the Japanese rear, but also poses a serious threat to Japanese warships and merchant ships along the Yangtze River. The sudden and unpredictable Chinese mobile artillery units also strike fear into the hearts of the Japanese warships and merchant ships. It is learned that the Japanese shipping company Fuju has received orders to paint all ships sailing in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River a light black color in an attempt to evade attacks by the Chinese Air Force and mobile artillery units.</p>

<p>US Consul General to Shanghai Gauss will take advantage of his vacation to meet with US High Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre. Because US Ambassador to China Johnson arrived in Shanghai last night, Mr. Gauss reported everything, and after thinking about it, he would meet with Admiral Huddle after the meeting with US Ambassador to China Johnson last night, and then depart for the Philippines with Admiral Huddle on the flagship Augusta this morning.</p>
<p>Discussing the Maintenance of Far East Interests</p>
<p>A meeting is scheduled to be held this week in Baguio, Philippines, to discuss the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty, which the US government insists on, to protect American interests in the Far East, and to decide on future policies. In addition to participating in Sayre and Gauss, the location of Baguio in the southern part of the island and the composition of the Asian Fleet will be thoroughly inspected and studied.</p>
<p>Commissioner Sayre to Come to Shanghai Next Spring</p>
<p>Huddle will stay in the Philippines for a long period of time and will not come north for a while. Commissioner Sayre, after meeting with Gauss and Admiral Huddle, will tour the southern countries before the end of this year, and may come to Shanghai next spring to meet with Ambassador Johnson to discuss everything. If time permits, he plans to visit Ambassador Grew in Japan.</p>
<p>Philippine Defense Greatly Strengthened</p>
<p>The US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Navigation will expire on January 26, and the US will implement economic action, so Far East defense will become tighter. Therefore, the defense of the Philippines, which controls the Pacific entrance, has been greatly strengthened. In addition to 14 naval bombers and 7 submarines sailing to the Philippines to join the defense, new ships will continue to be sent to the Philippines. The US government has decided to entrust Admiral Huddle with the responsibility for commanding everything in the Far East defense. The upcoming Philippines conference, concerning US interests in the Far East, deserves special attention.</p>
<p>Gauss's Vacation Lasts Six Weeks</p>
<p>Consul General Gauss will meet with his wife and eldest son Charles, who are returning from the US to the Far East. The date of his return to Shanghai will be next spring. The duties of the consulate in Shanghai will be assumed by Lockhart of the US Embassy in Beiping. Mr. Lockhart arrived here from Beiping on the 10th. In addition, the Municipal Council recently received a notice stating that the US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, had been approved to take a six-week vacation starting on the 18th of this month. During all vacation periods, the affairs of the consulate will be temporarily handled by Lockhart (Fraut P. Locklart), Counselor and Consul General of the Embassy.</p>
<p>Western Newspapers Describe the Nature of the Meeting</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated, "It was learned this morning (the 20th) that the US destroyer Augusta is scheduled to leave Shanghai early tomorrow morning (the 21st). US Consul General Gauss will take the opportunity to travel to Manila as a guest of Admiral Huddle, Commander-in-Chief of the US Asiatic Fleet. On the surface, Gauss is going to Manila to meet his wife and son, who are flying across the Pacific from the United States on the Clipper flying boat.</p>
<p>The Plane Departs</p>
<p>It will arrive in the Philippines in a few days. However, it is said that Gauss will stay in the Philippines until the end of this year, during which time he will hold several meetings with US Commissioner to the Philippines Sayre and Admiral Huddle. Admiral Huddle will also be stationed in Philippine waters until next spring. Reporters expect that the three US officials will hold</p>
<p>The Nature of the Meeting</p>
<p>When asked about this at the local consulate, they did not give a definite answer. However, reliable sources say that, given the recent movements of British troops in China, the discussion among the three officials may center on the US's military strategy in the Far East, both naval and land forces. It is also generally believed that the three officials will also</p>
<p>Conduct Research</p>
<p>Gauss will meet with US Ambassador to China Johnson, who arrived in Shanghai tonight, before leaving Shanghai tomorrow morning. Gauss will also report the details of the recent discussions held with Japanese envoy Kato to US Ambassador and Sayre. Gauss will be away from Shanghai until early next year. During his absence, Lockhart, Counselor of the US Embassy in Beiping, will be in charge of the affairs of the US Consulate in this city."</p>
<h3 id="e49">Faced with Public Criticism, the Japanese Release a Batch of Eggs; Eggs Shipped to Shanghai Still Need to Be Inspected; Very Few Are Allowed to Enter the Concession <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>After the Japanese government controlled the egg trade, it initially decided not to allow the free transport of eggs into the Concession for sale. However, recently, due to the overwhelming public criticism, in order to cover up public opinion, it agreed to allow some eggs to be transported into the Concession, but the number was very small. Eggs transported to Shanghai from the suburbs must be gathered at the so-called "New Huishan Wharf" in Pudong (near the Yangtze Wharf), and after Japanese personnel are sent to inspect them by small motorboat, they are allowed to be transported into the Concession if they are deemed acceptable. Otherwise, the eggs are forcibly loaded onto the motorboat and transported to the "Livestock Market" where they are bought at a reduced price. Yesterday, 100 from Tianshenggang, about 80,000 eggs, were brought by Nantong Maru, purchased by the British firm Moo Chong. When it docked at the Yangtze Wharf, it was inspected by Japanese personnel. Because it was owned by a British firm, it was allowed to be released and transported in.</p>

<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated that yesterday (the 19th), Japanese military police arrested Western Police Chief Aygerburg and two Chinese police officers, and a female inspector, on a road in the Public Concession within the Italian military defense zone. After a strong protest from the Italian Marines, Western Police Chief Ayer and the female inspector were released last night, but the two Chinese police officers are still being held in detention by the Japanese military police today (the 20th). It is not clear why. Officer Ayger led a search party on Rue Robert生 to carry out</p>
<p>Routine Duties</p>
<p>At that time, he attempted to search a suspicious man. The man shouted to a street police officer standing on the road in the Concession. The officer fired a shot aimlessly. The search party heard the sound and drew their guns, loaded with live ammunition. A shot was accidentally fired. The search party then chased the suspicious man along the road when the Japanese military police arrived on the scene and</p>
<p>Arrested Everyone</p>
<p>Later, after protests from the Italian Marines and Danish Consul General Hill, Western Police Chief Ayger was released after being held for five hours, and the female inspector was released at the same time, but the two Chinese police officers are still being detained by the Japanese at No. 94 Jessfield Road. The reason is unknown. In recent days, street police have used</p>
<p>Rifles to Shoot</p>
<p>This is the second time that street police have fired rifles on the roads of the Concession in the rogue territory. The first time was at the intersection of Thibet Road and Avenue Road, when a street police officer who usurped the police authority of the Police Department fired a shot at a British expatriate driving a car. It is said that it was because the British expatriate did not obey the "traffic signals" issued by the police officer.</p>
<p>French Army Officer Shot</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury" stated that French Army Corporal Mandolini was shot in the leg by a Chinese man at the corner of Hongqiao Road and Columbia Road just after midnight yesterday. At the time, Corporal Mann was off duty and on his way back to the barracks. It is widely believed that he had an argument with the Chinese man at the scene, which led to the shooting.</p>

<p>According to intelligence statistics from various agencies in Zhejiang Province, as compiled by the Zhejiang Provincial Political Work Guidance Office, there were a total of 175 Japanese air raids in the province in the four months from July to October of this year, with 578 bombs dropped, destroying 1,345 houses, injuring 99 people, and killing 63 people. On average, each bomb destroyed two houses, six bombs injured one person, and nine bombs killed one person. Among these, the bombing of Lishui, Linhai, and Qingtian counties in August was the most devastating. However, those harmed and killed were all innocent civilians with little to no military value. As the Japanese are aware of their weak bombing capabilities, they have recently intensified their efforts, even deploying air-burst bombs with the aim of killing civilians dispersed in open areas outside the city. These types of bombs have been discovered in various locations, and their effectiveness in harming the population is greater. The Zhejiang Provincial Government, recognizing the large population of the province and fearing that existing air raid shelters will be insufficient, has reportedly instructed the Air Defense Headquarters to expedite the construction of more air raid shelters in proportion to the population to minimize unnecessary sacrifices.</p>

<p>The Neihe steamship Guohua, operated by a Japanese company, arrived at the wharf yesterday morning with five Chinese passengers who had been severely injured. They were taken to Renji Hospital by an ambulance from the Shanghai Municipal Council. It is reported that the injuries of the five men were extremely severe, with some having broken leg bones. According to them, they recently boarded the ship from Xingang to Shanghai. Before departure, fearing that they would not have enough food en route, they bought a small amount of flour on the shore to stave off hunger. Unexpectedly, this was seen by the Japanese soldiers stationed there, who suspected them of transporting food for export. Without explanation, they were beaten with gun butts and wooden sticks. Although they quickly discarded the flour, they had already suffered bloodshed and fractures.</p>

<h3 id="e58">The Authorities Are Determined to Subdue Those Manipulating Rice Prices; Speculators Attempting to Form a Group; Strict Punishment Will Be Imposed Upon Confirmation; Hoarders Weaving Their Own Doom, Rice Prices Fell Yesterday <a href="#e58" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c58" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">58</a></h3>
<p>The recent food issue in Shanghai, with the unreasonable surge in rice prices, is about to trigger a severe situation like that a month ago. However, this time, the turmoil is clearly due to someone speculating and manipulating the market again, which should be thoroughly investigated and punished. The reporter from Dazhong News Agency has learned the following information:</p>
<p>Various Parties Proceeding to Stop Manipulation</p>
<p>At this time of new grain harvest and abundant autumn harvest, all sectors of this city, aware of the severity of the food issue in Shanghai two months ago, the Shanghai Municipal Council and various powerful groups are planning to set up grain storage groups and operate rice businesses as a precautionary measure to prevent panic next spring. Unexpectedly, in the past three or four days, the peak of japonica rice has suddenly risen to the 40 yuan mark. The reason for this is definitely not due to blocked sources or meager reserves. The rice sources in the suburbs are continuously being imported into the concession, and according to the Shanghai Municipal Council's investigation, the current rice reserves in Shanghai are similar to when rice prices were stable, and the amount is immeasurably different from the amount when rice prices rose in September. Therefore, it is obvious that this increase is being manipulated by speculators behind the scenes in order to make huge profits. In order to prevent food panic and maintain social order, it is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council is now thoroughly investigating the truth behind the increase. Once the facts are verified, it will proceed to impose strict punishment. In addition to the City Federation presenting a close watch to the concession authorities, powerful groups such as the silver and money industries and various factory industries have recently jointly requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Rice Industry Association to take effective measures to stop speculation and manipulation and stabilize people's hearts. The pressure of social justice should somewhat reduce the insatiable desires of unscrupulous merchants.</p>
<p>Fundraising for Manipulation, Under Investigation</p>
<p>Moreover, according to the Dazhong News Agency reporter's inquiry to two rice industry giants, the continuous rise in rice prices is due to someone speculating and profiting from it, and there is no other reason to explain it. To say that it is due to blocked sources, insufficient reserves, or the Japanese rice panic is all a confusion of black and white. At least seven or eight thousand bags of rice arrive in Shanghai every day, and Shanghai only needs 7,000 bags of rice per day, and the reserves are very sufficient. As for the Japanese absorbing grain from the inland, most of them purchase Wuhu indica rice (i.e., indica rice from the Wuhu area). Those transported from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway area to Shanghai are all japonica rice, so they are not affected by it. Why is japonica rice rising so much? The reason is not difficult to understand. When the reporter asked whether there was any truth to the rumors that speculators were raising funds to form a company in order to manipulate the rice market on a large scale, the answer was that they did not know the details. However, the rice industry groups have been conducting thorough investigations and discussing countermeasures in recent days in order to eradicate future hidden dangers.</p>
<p>Hoarders' Plans Fail, Rice Prices Fall</p>
<p>After the soaring rice prices, due to the obvious manipulation by unscrupulous merchants behind the scenes, public opinion was rife with complaints, and the Rice Market Management Committee also resolved the day before yesterday to rectify brokers arbitrarily raising prices in the market, forcing the generally treacherous elements to restrain themselves slightly. Yesterday, the arrival of rice in the rice market by land and water totaled more than 7,000 bags. The amount of rice registered by cargo owners with the Rice Market Management Committee for consignment increased by more than 400 bags compared to the previous day, to 1,900 bags. The situation in the rice market after the opening was more stable than yesterday. As a result, due to smooth sources, prices fell, with various japonica rice varieties falling by about two yuan per picul. Indica rice varieties also fell by one yuan and two or three jiao. It is predicted that hoarders will have to sell urgently because they cannot maintain the original price, and rice prices will fall further.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Inquires About Two Rice Stores</p>
<p>The Xiechangde Rice Store at 206 Avenue Road, Shanghai, had 125 bags of rice consigned by a Wuxi merchant through the Yongxing Transportation Company to the store for retail sales. Unexpectedly, the day after the rice was transported to Shanghai, three Japanese personnel went to the store to investigate the transportation passport, claiming that the passport was forged, and prohibiting its sale. They planned to take the rice away completely. The store argued that the passport issue was the responsibility of the Yongxing Transportation Company and had nothing to do with the consignee. It immediately rejected the Japanese side's request and notified the police. Upon receiving the news, the police immediately sent three Chinese officers to protect the store. Upon hearing the news, the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai also sent troops to assist in the protection, as the area was part of the U.S. military defense zone. As the police have not yet clarified the facts of the case, the store has been ordered to temporarily stop withdrawing the 75 bags of rice stored in the Shanghai Bank warehouse, and the store has been instructed that if there are any further disputes due to this matter in the future, they can notify the police at any time. A similar situation occurred at the Yuanmao Rice Store at 13, Lane 344, Baker Road, which was also given protection by the U.S. military and the police.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury reports that the Panama-flagged freighter Bolivar, managed by Wah Lun Company, has been released this morning (the 20th) after being detained by the Japanese Special Service Department for nearly three weeks. The Japanese authorities have verbally notified the U.S. Consul, the representative of the Panamanian government in Shanghai, about the release of the ship. However, no news has been issued as to whether a Chinese, the second officer of the ship, who was detained shortly after the Bolivar was seized, has been released.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chicken People Relief Association, Citizens Group Solicitation Committee, issued an announcement to all sectors for raising funds for refugee cotton clothing, stating that as winter approaches and the weather gets colder day by day, the refugees in the shelters and on the streets still do not have cotton clothing for the winter, especially those poor children who are so cold that their faces are colorless, which is really very pitiful. In order to help them, the association has scheduled to hold a carnival at the Gengxin Stage on Niuzhuang Road from the 27th to the 30th of this month. The program includes a grand show with famous amateurs, famous actors, movie stars, Shanghai opera, comedy, storytelling, Kunqu opera, and drama, which is extremely exciting and intense. Tickets are divided into three types: Honorary Tickets (10 yuan), Fortune Fruit Tickets (5 yuan), and Philanthropic Tickets (2 yuan). Sales have already begun. All ticket proceeds will be used for refugee cotton clothing expenses. It is hoped that all sectors will participate enthusiastically. It is truly immeasurable merit to both feast the eyes and help the refugees. Ticket sales locations: (1) Room 414, Xingye Building, Jiangxi Road and Beijing Road, the association's office. To purchase tickets by phone, please dial 18533, and we will send someone to deliver them. (2) Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, and Dah Sun department stores on Nanjing Road.

<p>Factory registration matters in this city were previously managed by the Social Affairs Bureau of the Municipal Government. After the Social Affairs Bureau temporarily ceased to exercise its functions, the Ministry of Economic Affairs recently stipulated that all factory registrations can be directly applied for with the Ministry of Economic Affairs in Chongqing, still in accordance with the original method, by filling out Forms A and B. It is learned that the two forms have now been printed and distributed by the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Form A should include: (1) Factory name and address; (2) Factory manager; (3) Chief technician; (4) Company or business capital; (5) Factory organization; (6) Registration license number; (7) Date of commencement of operations; (8) Products and raw materials; (9) Motive power; (10) Machinery and important tools; (11) Factory address and building; (12) Product sales area and sales volume; (13) Manufacturing process description; (14) Cost accounting; (15) Whether there are branch factories. Form B should include: (1) Number of staff; (2) Number of workers; (3) Highest and lowest wages; (4) Working hours; (5) Whether there is a labor contract; (6) Worker reward and punishment methods; (7) Types of worker welfare programs; (8) Factory safety and health facilities, etc.</p>

<p>The Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Society remitted funds to Tianjin, and recently entrusted churches in 21 counties including Jing County and Shen County to organize branch associations for relief distribution. Funds have also been remitted to Anhui Province, such as Bengbu, Wuhu, Anqing, Bo County, Fuyang, Shou County, Huaiyuan, and Huaian in northern Jiangsu, for relief. It is learned that the Society's Secretary-General Ou Yongkang is raising funds in Hong Kong and will return to Shanghai soon. If various sectors in this city can also provide a steady stream of donations, a large-scale relief distribution plan will still need to be planned.</p>

<p>The Chongqing Trade Commission, according to the request of the Haimen settlement agent Dong, that coastal sailing vessels from the port are transporting goods for export without documents that can be ordered to be submitted to the bank. If the settlement amount is handed over locally, the Haimen Bank of China cannot settle the account due to the fluctuating black market price, and the foreign exchange settled under the newly promulgated settlement method must be registered, certified, and paid in Hong Kong, which is difficult to hand over in the interior. If merchants are required to pay a security deposit, it would cost two or three times as much and be difficult to bear. Moreover, this type of sailing vessel sails to Shanghai rather than Hong Kong, and the seaports of Wenzhou and Fuzhou also have this situation. In addition to temporarily requiring merchants to pay a security deposit, it is requested to instruct what to do to be appropriate. After receiving the report, the Commission believes that under this settlement method, it is possible to negotiate with the bank to reduce the security deposit amount according to the actual situation or add a credit guarantee to prevent emergencies, and immediately instructed the branch to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e64">Fire at Shanghai River Primary School, One Student Fell and Was Injured <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>At about 1:21 PM yesterday, a fire broke out upstairs at the Shanghai River Primary School at 19, Nanyang Lane, North Zhejiang Road, because incense sticks lit upstairs fell onto the window awning. At that time, there were a total of more than 400 students in the school, and when they suddenly heard the fire alarm while classes were in session in the classrooms, the students fled in panic. A male student, Qin Meiyou, aged eleven, jumped from the window upstairs, fracturing his left foot. He was subsequently taken to the Tibetan Road Refugee Hospital by the Fire Brigade ambulance. The fire was extinguished quickly due to the large number of people, and fortunately did not burn down the buildings, only scorching the doors and windows, and the loss was still small.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Legal Tender Circulation in Shanghai Will Definitely Not Be Lacking, Foreign Banks Providing Assistance at Any Time, Large Quantities of Small Denomination Notes Will Soon Be Shipped to Shanghai, Speculators Make Trouble and Profit, Harming Public Security <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>After Li Jiannan, the puppet "Jianghai Customs Superintendent," attempted to obstruct the import of Chinese legal tender, various foreign banks firmly opposed and ignored it. For the needs of legitimate trade, they are shipping legal tender from Hong Kong to Shanghai for assistance. The four banks, namely the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank of China, have already temporarily stopped shipping legal tender to Shanghai due to their forced environment. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the circulation of legal tender in Shanghai is sufficient to meet the needs of the market. All industries unanimously refuse to use "Huaxing notes." Foreign banks often ship legal tender to Shanghai, so there will definitely not be a lack of legal tender in Shanghai, causing panic. Regarding subsidiary coins and small denomination notes, which are issued by the Central Bank of China and other banks, those circulating on the market include the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the Jiangsu Farmers Bank, and the Zhejiang Local Bank, etc., in large numbers. Recently, the Central Bank of China has temporarily suspended issuance because the existing notes have been issued. This has led to speculators making trouble and profiting in the market. It is learned that foreign banks have reached an agreement with the Central Bank's head office and will ship large quantities of subsidiary coins to Shanghai, so there will be no problem with subsidiary coins. It is also learned that the first batch of 500,000 yuan in fractional currency notes has been issued, and the second batch is being rushed to print by the American company Yongning, and will be officially announced and issued as soon as it is delivered to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank.</p>
<h3 id="e66">Chen Zhanxiong's Bribery Case in Prison: Obvious Criminal Circumstances; Prosecutor's Arguments Stated; Yu Qiaqing and Others Attended Yesterday; Court Orders Conclusion of Trial Pending Judgment; Bail Denied <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Chen Zhanxiong, a native of Fenghua, age 44, residing at Lane 1316, No. 14, Xin Zha Road, owner of the Anle Palace Hotel dance hall and manager of the Ivanhoe Club on Yuyuan Road, Hongqiao, was arrested by the French police on the night of the second day of last month for smoking opium in the Anle Palace. The next day, he was transferred to the Special No. 2 Court and prosecuted according to law, sentenced to six months in prison, which could be commuted to a fine of three yuan per day. He was first sent to the detention center, with a deadline of one month to:</p>
<p>Quit Opium Addiction</p>
<p>This led to prisoners Qin Jiaqi, Tao Yongchang, Chen Jusheng, and others colluding with guards Jiang Ding, Tu Gang, Luo Zhiyi, and others to extort one hundred and fifty yuan, which they divided among themselves. They also provided Chen Zhanxiong with cigarettes, tea, and other items. This was discovered by the head guard of the detention center, who found evidence and sent all the above-mentioned individuals to the Prosecutor's Office of the Special No. 1 Court for investigation and prosecution. In the meantime, the two guards, Jiang Ding and Tu Gang, feeling guilty and fearing punishment, escaped. After the prosecutor concluded the investigation, because Chen Zhanxiong had completed his detoxification, he was released on a 3,000-yuan bail bond, to be available for questioning. The prosecutor's office then filed a public lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the same court on charges of:</p>
<p>Dereliction of Duty and Bribery</p>
<p>At the same time, Shen Tianhe and Lu Daming, the guarantors of the two guards Jiang and Tu, were strictly ordered to find and hand over Jiang and Tu to be investigated and prosecuted. When the case was heard by Judge Zhang Minsheng of the Criminal Court of the Special No. 2 Court on the afternoon of the sixth of this month, Chen Zhanxiong claimed illness and appointed lawyer Jiang Pingfan to appear in court. After a brief interrogation of the other defendants, the hearing was adjourned due to the absence of all the accused. Chen Zhanxiong presented a doctor's certificate claiming illness, but it was found that Chen was not being treated in a hospital, and police sent to apprehend him were unsuccessful. Due to Chen's:</p>
<p>Escape Attempt</p>
<p>His guarantor, Xia Dajin, was arrested on suspicion of concealing a criminal and facilitating his escape and transferred to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation and handling. At this point, Chen Zhanxiong, unwilling to implicate his guarantor, surrendered to the Prosecutor's Office on the afternoon of the eighth, reported in, and was detained, and transferred to the Criminal Court. Meanwhile, the Prosecutor's Office found no evidence that Chen's guarantor had concealed or assisted in his escape and ordered his release. All these details have been reported in this newspaper. The Criminal Court scheduled a public hearing for 2:00 PM yesterday. Because this case had attracted public attention, yesterday,</p>
<p>Prominent Figures in Shanghai</p>
<p>Including Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, and over ten others, all fellow villagers of Chen Zhanxiong, as well as Chen's relatives and friends, all attended the court hearing. The gallery of the Second Criminal Court was packed, leaving almost no room to stand. In addition to lawyer Jiang Pingfan, Chen Zhanxiong also appointed lawyer Jiang Yiping to participate in the defense. The other two defendants, Zhou Zhiyi and Tao Yongchang, also appointed lawyers Ge Zhijun and Zhou Lianze for their defense. At the third stroke of the clock, Judge Zhang Minsheng, together with the prosecutor, arrived at the Second Criminal Court for the hearing. According to:</p>
<p>Chen Zhanxiong's Testimony</p>
<p>Because of the opium case, I was arrested on the second day of last month and sent to the detention center to detoxify after being interrogated by the court on the third day. I was detained in cell number six. On the fourth day, I asked Tao Yongchang, a prisoner assigned to do errands, for hot water. Tao replied, "This is a prison, not a hotel." Then prisoner Qin Jiaqi said to me, "To win a lawsuit, you have to treat people." Because I couldn't understand his Shandong dialect clearly, I asked Chen Jusheng, a prisoner in the same cell, to translate. Later, it was agreed upon that the amount would be 150 yuan. On the fifth and ninth days, I wrote notes to the guard surnamed Jiang, asking him to send someone to the Anle Palace to get the money. But they took the money, didn't give it to me, and I didn't see it, so I don't know</p>
<p>How it was Divided</p>
<p>Later, Qin Jiaqi gave me cigarettes, tea, and food. The amount of 150 yuan was discussed between the guard surnamed Jiang and Qin, etc. When Zhou, Qin, Tao, and Chen Jusheng were questioned, they all denied asking Chen Zhanxiong for money and blamed it all on the two guards, Jiang and Tu, who were at large. The guarantors of Jiang and Tu, Shen Tianhe and his master Shen Cangyuan, and Lu Daming, all stated that they did not know the individuals personally and that friends had introduced them to act as guarantors. They really didn't know where they had escaped. At this point, the court, considering the case clear, ordered arguments to be made. The prosecutor's opinion was as follows: "The defendants all</p>
<p>Admitted Unreservedly</p>
<p>During the investigation and in court, but now they are recanting. However, the circumstances of the crime are obvious and should be punished according to the crime of bribery and dereliction of duty." After the defendants' lawyers made their defenses one by one, the court ordered the conclusion of the debate and scheduled the verdict to be announced at 2:00 PM on the twenty-seventh. The defendants were returned to custody. Chen Zhanxiong's lawyers, Jiang and Jiang, earnestly requested the court to grant bail, but the judge stated that the defendant's crime was serious and denied bail.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning at around 7:00 AM, detectives Shen Jinshu, Dai Rongji, Jiang Zhongjia, and others from the Criminal Division of the French Concession Police Station rushed to a certain foreign cloth store at No. 1225 Haig Road, Hongqiao, and arrested the store's local manager, Qu, taking him back to the police station for detention. The case originated on the afternoon of September 20th of this year at around 7:00 PM, when Shen Chengyu, a local resident and owner of a leather glove factory at No. 10 Renhe Lane, Hongqiao Road, was passing by the entrance of Xiaoyou Lane on Avenue Petain when several local ruffians, including Qin Haixiang and Shen Huixing, blocked Shen and threatened him with handguns and other weapons to extort 3,000 yuan. Shen was outnumbered and pleaded that he didn't have the money with him. Qin and the others then gave Shen a week to reply. Subsequently, Qu's seventh younger brother stepped forward to mediate, and the two parties negotiated at the Samsung Teahouse on Rue Remy on the 26th of the same month, agreeing on 800 yuan as "longevity money," with 300 yuan to be paid first. A person named Wu Tianming was also present. On the afternoon of the 18th at around 5:00 PM, the two parties agreed to pay the remaining amount at the Yile Teahouse in Xujiahui, but Shen, unwilling to comply, secretly reported to the French police beforehand, who dispatched disguised detectives to the scene and arrested Qin Haixiang and Shen Huixing (nicknamed "Little Iron Plate") on the spot. After interrogating them at the police station, they confessed that Qu had mediated the matter. The police, believing that Qu was involved in the extortion case, secretly went to arrest him yesterday morning.</p>

<h3 id="e77">Letter <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>November 20th, The news item "Drunkard Creates Trouble in Hotel" in your newspaper's news column on the 20th of this month is inconsistent with the facts. It is not true that I and Inspector Wang of the Far East Hotel were drinking that evening and quarreled over a hostess. The dispute was caused by the rude and insulting remarks made by the hotel owner, Yan Yongxiao, towards his patrons, which led to an argument. The hotel owner then called the police, and Chinese police officer No. 3048 arrived. After investigating the truth, it was confirmed that the hotel owner had insulted the customer, and the Chinese police officer was present, Yan was still very arrogant. All the facts are there, how can one smear someone's reputation? The hotel owner later realized that he was wrong and asked the Chinese police officer to leave. We are all honest businessmen and do not want to argue with the hotel owner. However, since it concerns the reputation of myself and Inspector Wang of the Far East Hotel, and since it is inconsistent with the facts, I hereby request your newspaper to correct it to avoid rumors and misunderstandings. Sincerely, Zhang Jiale, November 20th</p>

<h3 id="e79">Finance: Tianjin Banks Buy Heavily; Gold Market Flourishes Again <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold secret market situation, inheriting the improved and potentially solid momentum of the previous weekend, the situation entered a favorable state early on. Because the Tianjin exchange rate market was tight, the gold price in that area rose, so Tianjin banks put a lot of effort into covering short positions in this city. At the same time, this caused local retail investors to follow suit and search for positions, and there was no shortage of positive rumors among them. Although the buying trend was strong, the securities companies continued to push out a considerable amount in the afternoon session, so the final closing result was only more than forty yuan higher. Early in the morning, the exchange rate market was softening, and a certain money exchange and a certain securities company took the lead in releasing their positions, and the price rose to 3,660 yuan. Unexpectedly, a certain gold shop suddenly poured out more than two hundred taels, and the rising momentum was immediately frustrated, immediately returning fifteen yuan. At that time, the sellers also stopped selling, but the foreign exchange was still firm and did not release, and a certain money exchange and a certain securities company absorbed each other, causing the price to rise again to 3,660 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange returned to parity, and money exchanges and gold shops came out to release, and for a time there were few takers, so it had fallen to a low of 3,640 yuan. Until before the closing in the afternoon, the exchange rate market was stable, and a certain gold shop pulled up on behalf of Hong Kong banks, and the closing price rose again to 3,657 yuan. In the afternoon, people's hearts became more excited. A certain money exchange continued to scoop up more than 300 taels, although a certain securities company also vigorously sold as many as 500 taels, but retail investors were bullish and followed suit, and the market was firm. The highest price was once 3,680 yuan, and the final closing price was still 3,677 yuan, which was 47 yuan higher than the closing price on the previous weekend. The entire day's transactions were brisk, with approximately 2,800 taels traded. Gold jewelry in gold shops was marked up by five yuan, while customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Rose 47 Yuan</p>
<p>From the beginning of the morning, each tael (ten taels) carried the remaining prestige of the previous Saturday afternoon, and the exchange rate market opened slightly soft, and then a certain money exchange and a securities company mutually released and bought, causing the market to open high at 3,660 yuan. Then the money exchanges did thirty taels of mutual business. Unexpectedly, at this time, a certain gold shop suddenly poured out more than two hundred taels on behalf of a customer, the trend was frustrated, and it immediately fell back fifteen yuan. A certain gold shop sold twenty taels to a gold number for 3,645 yuan. After that, the exchange rate market continued to soften, and a certain gold shop had stopped selling and was watching, so it rose again. A securities company bought forty taels from a gold shop for 3,660 yuan. Subsequently, because the foreign exchange suddenly turned hard, gold shops and money exchanges took the opportunity to compete to sell, and soon they fell back a little twenty yuan. A gold shop sold twenty taels to a money exchange for 3,640 yuan. At that time, a certain money exchange came to absorb a hundred taels, so it raised the price by ten yuan. A certain money exchange bought thirty taels from a securities company for 3,650 yuan. Later, a certain gold number and another money exchange came to sell, and the price was pushed down to 3,640 yuan. Near noon, a certain money exchange revived the buying trend, and the certain gold shop that had dumped in the early morning suddenly bought on behalf of a Hong Kong bank, and the exchange rate market had stopped loosening and turned flat, rising again. Before long, it rose seventeen yuan. A money exchange bought thirty taels from a securities company, for 3,657 yuan as the closing price at noon. It was heard that a certain gold shop still had strong buying intentions after the closing, and the price was raised to 3,660 yuan. In the afternoon, a securities company sold thirty taels to a gold shop, still for 3,660 yuan. Later, because a certain money exchange revitalized the remaining power and vigorously bought more than two hundred taels, and the foreign exchange was stable and slightly soft, the price was raised by twelve yuan. A certain money exchange bought thirty taels from a gold number for 3,672 yuan. At that time, a securities company vigorously sold more than three hundred taels, so it fell back a little seven yuan. A securities company sold twenty taels to a gold shop for 3,665 yuan. Afterwards, the selling intention of the securities company was slightly weaker, and a certain money exchange and retail investors had some appetite, so the price rose again by fifteen yuan. A money exchange bought twenty taels from a gold number for 3,680 yuan. Near the closing, the market was slightly weak. A securities company sold twenty taels to a money exchange for 3,677 yuan. As a result, it rose forty-seven yuan compared to the previous Saturday's closing price, with a fluctuation of forty yuan throughout the day. The selling price of spot gold numbers was ten yuan higher than the spot gold, and the buying price was reduced by more than twenty yuan. The current bid price for gold is five to sixty yuan lower than the listed price.</p>

<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market, HSBC listing, the announcement was still flat. Although the British and American exchange secret market was at the beginning of the week, there were still no major changes. This was because the atmosphere in the market has been silent recently, and buying and selling have been slow. Yesterday's process hovered from beginning to end. At the beginning, Hong Kong Telegraph put out its positions first, while HSBC vigorously absorbed. Then, a certain American bank bought British gold, and at the same time, general Chinese merchants' buying intentions revived, so at this moment it was tight and soft. It was once tight to five pennies, two eight one two five and eight yuan five six two five. Soon the buyers were satisfied, and the American bank resold American exchange, and even Hong Kong Telegraph re-released its positions, so it returned to parity. Extended to the afternoon closing, the appearance was slightly soft, with British gold at five pennies three one two five and American exchange at eight yuan six two five. In the afternoon, the situation was often in a stable state, and Japanese merchant banks and speculators slightly bought forward contracts.

As a result, British gold still closed at five pennies three one two five, and American exchange slightly softened to eight yuan five nine three seven five, compared to the previous weekend, British was tight at zero three one two five and American was soft at zero six two five. The trend of futures opening was the same as that of spot.</p>
<p>American and Hong Kong Banks Still Sell</p>
<p>In the early morning, due to the London big market and the American bank price were on holiday and there was no electricity, the London raw gold was fixed. The exchange rate of British to American and to France were all flat, to Shanghai was long zero six two five. The American to British continued to shrink two five, to Shanghai was big five points, to France was small one two five. The central listing of all exchanges was as before. The banks opened the spot selling price in the morning, British gold five pennies three four three seven five, American exchange eight yuan six five six two five, compared to the previous Saturday, there was no honor or disgrace. After the opening, although Hong Kong Telegraph came to release, because HSBC had a lot of appetite, and a certain American bank also absorbed British gold, Chinese merchants also came to buy, so the appearance was soft. Once British gold softened to five pennies two eight one two five, and American exchange was also tight to eight yuan five six two five. HSBC listing announced that it would not move, and the silver balance tax announcement also had no increase or decrease. Not long after, a certain American bank suddenly came to sell American exchange, and Hong Kong Telegraph came to throw and sell, so the market immediately returned to parity. Hong Kong Telegraph and a certain bank sold spot British gold to Datong Youli and other foreign firms for five pennies three one two five and three four three seven five, and spot American exchange for eight yuan six two five and six five six two five.

<p>The off-exchange securities market continued its weak and lifeless state yesterday. Investor sentiment remained uncertain, making a rebound difficult in the short term. At the opening of trading yesterday morning, both bulls and bears remained largely on the sidelines. Most of the trading on the exchange floor consisted of scalping activities, seeking minor profits. Market prices fluctuated between 5 and 10 cents, showing a slight decline compared to Saturday. Afternoon trading was quiet, with most issues remaining unchanged, and a few rising or falling within a 5 to 10 cent range. The resulting atmosphere of inactivity led to a daily decrease in the number of attendees. Most stock prices ended the day down by a cent or two, with only Ding-type stocks performing well, up by four cents, due to not having traded on Saturday afternoon. The total trading volume was approximately 500,000 yuan. A brief summary is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: 30 shares of Guohuo Bank stock were traded at a price of 45 yuan each.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce's stock market opened in the afternoon yesterday with extreme activity. Amid a surge, various stocks that had been attracting public attention experienced new price levels. After a period of lull, Jardine Matheson shares soared to 68.5 yuan, a substantial increase of more than 3 yuan from the previous weekend's closing price. Steel industry shares also rose to a high of 15.1 yuan. Subsequently, many stocks experienced a considerable retracement as investors took profits, highlighting the underlying potential of the market and the unpredictable nature of its fluctuations.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Cotton Yarn and Raw Cotton: Indian Cotton Soars; Cotton Yarn Shows Only Slight Gain <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market was calm and quiet, with a slightly stabilizing trend. This was due to the sharp rise in the price of Indian cotton, which increased the cost of cotton yarn. As a result, general holders of yarn felt more secure, with most taking a positive view of the future and expecting a consolidation of the floor. Selling pressure eased, but actual demand remained stagnant. Transportation on various routes was difficult, preventing the rise of prices despite the renewed confidence. This was because current consumption and production were not yet in balance. It is expected that once business picks up, the market will develop.</p>
<p>At the opening of the raw yarn market this morning, people gathered to discuss the upward trend of cotton yarn, given the strong surge in the price of foreign cotton. Investor sentiment was strong, but sales were slow. Actual transactions were few, creating a slight disappointment. The opening price increased by 2 yuan to 632 yuan, and rose to 634 yuan during the day. Later on, the price retreated 2 yuan because of weak demand. According to half-day statistics, 939 bales were traded. Yesterday's transactions involved 415 bales. In terms of price, Shuangma brand 20-count yarn rose by 2 yuan, Tiannv by 4 yuan, and Shuangdiqiu by 5 yuan. 210 pieces of cotton yarn were exported to Hong Kong today. The amount purchased by each group is listed below.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Cotton from the Interior Arrives in Quantity; Fails to Keep Pace with Indian Cotton's Rise <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Trading in local cotton was still supportable. However, factory demand was again subdued, because yarn sales were sluggish and factory inventories were again rising. As a result, intentions to purchase raw materials were relaxed. Japanese factories were in a similar situation, making trading increasingly depressed. Despite the sharp rise in the price of Indian cotton overseas, it was hoped that local cotton would also rise. However, the Shanghai market was poor, and at the same time, cotton from the interior was arriving in crowded conditions, creating a temporary constraint and preventing upward momentum. Nevertheless, most people were optimistic about the future. Over 10,000 bales of cotton from Subei arrived in the past two days. A large number were held by brokers, causing warehouses to be filled to capacity and creating a shortage of storage space. The prices at which raw cotton has been trading are recorded below.</p>
<p>In other news, in terms of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market opened very strong this morning, with active speculation. Buyers in Bombay were actively purchasing, causing some short covering. Spot goods remained exceptionally good. Closing prices rose five to six points from the previous day. The Indian cotton market also rose sharply by more than nine rupees due to the sharp rise in the price of jute and aggressive buying by speculators. A telegram received this morning reported that the market opened up another 10 rupees. Egyptian cotton rose by more than 30 points.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Grains: Rice Speculation Slightly Eases; Japonica Rice Retraces a Little... Kexian Rice Relatively Firm; Foreign Rice Orders Approaching 10,000 Tons... Some Replenishment <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The rice market, which had been rising steadily, suddenly softened yesterday afternoon after prices had gone up too much. Sources from various areas, including Sujia, Kuntai, and Qingfeng, arrived with 30 to 40 cartloads of goods, further dampening market sentiment. The previous rise had been too rapid, so when the market faltered, the decline was also sharp. Dealers from the interior mostly stopped trading, and local stores were also watching, only making minor purchases to meet immediate needs. The market's trading volume was the opposite of the previous frenzy. Hoarders, seeing that there was no more profit to be made and holding large quantities of high-priced goods, took precautions against the dangers of the market’s current volatility with the arrival of the new crop. Some sought to unload, and with a drop in confidence, their strategy suddenly changed from buying to selling, causing them to dump their inventory in a stampede. However, the downward trend was already in place, and it was difficult to reverse. All watched and no one was taking delivery, so they had to cut prices and sell at a loss, causing the drop to accelerate. Many brokers with unsold goods also rushed to offer samples. However, seeing that the market was deteriorating, potential customers' willingness to buy declined further, causing prices to fall further. As a result, prices plummeted by one to three yuan. According to statistics, total city trade volume was no more than 4,000 to 5,000 bags. The closing prices for Changte Jing were 38 yuan, for City brand 37 yuan, for Medium brand 36 yuan, Kunsu white Japonica 37 yuan to 34.5 yuan, Qing Sha Luzhong 34.5 yuan, and Feng Jia Luzhong 32 to 33 yuan, a decrease of 1 to 3 yuan compared to the previous market. Lu Yang Jian opened at 35.5 yuan and 35 yuan. Because of the shortage, the price remained unchanged, Kexian dropped more than a yuan. Jiangbei Jian sold for 34 to 35 yuan, Jing Wu Jian for 35 yuan, and second grade to 33 yuan, Yin Bian Yuan dropped about 2.5 yuan, Chen Yuan 37 yuan, Xin 36 yuan, Yin Yuan 35.5 yuan, 33 to 34 yuan. In conclusion, the sudden rise in rice prices during this time of abundant harvests and rising tide was entirely driven by hoarders. In this time of national crisis and difficult living conditions, hoarders only care about their own private interests and exploit the public. Such avarice cannot be tolerated.</p>
<p>In other news, Kexian rice was once again acquired by hoarders yesterday morning, and the market continued to move upward. Speculation and manipulation were rampant, and speculators were taking advantage of the upward trend. Due to limited supply and strong demand, market prices gradually rose. The morning market was raised by nearly a yuan, but after the high price, actual sales had long since stopped. Profit-taking was prevalent. As more foreign rice was being traded again, and Anhui and Jiangsu Kexian rice had already been shipped after hearing the news, small batches of 100 to 200 and 300 to 500 bags were gradually arriving in port. Goods on the way were also arriving in Shanghai in a continuous stream, softening market sentiment and causing the market to experience a reversal, plunging roughly 2 yuan. This was nearly a yuan less than the previous day. The actual trade volume for the day did not exceed 3,000 bags.</p>
<p>In addition to previous orders of 2,400 tons, 500 tons, and 1,000 tons of foreign rice, two more batches were confirmed yesterday. One batch of 1,000 tons was negotiated earlier and is goods ready to load at 35 yuan. Expected arrival is at the beginning of the month. Another batch of 4,800 tons, or some say 4,700 tons, will be shipped in the middle of next month and will not arrive until the second half of the month. The price is 35.02 yuan. There are a total of five batches of 9,700 tons, which is roughly 100,000 bags. The shipments are handled by Daufu Foreign Firm, and the order was placed by a joint organization of grain merchants.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton trade saw Indian cotton priced about 20 yuan higher per picul than American cotton, so it has long been neglected. Recently, as the price of American cotton has risen daily, trading has eased. Factories have also stopped purchasing because yarn sales are sluggish. However, they are making some purchases of goods that are especially cheap. Below is the market price of American cotton, calculated at a spot exchange rate of 8.625 yuan to the dollar (excluding dock delivery tax):</p>

<p>Yesterday morning, the oil market was relatively stable. Afterwards, buying interest increased, and barreled oil chased after the barreled oil, first soaring. The barrel oil company, formed by 18 companies cooperating, was again active in the market. As a result, barrel and barrel oil both reached new highs.

<h3 id="e87">Piece Goods: Cloth Sales Slightly Increase; Guerrilla Areas Vigorously Purchase Domestic Cloth; Dongpi Fine Twill Shipped to Tianjin and Yantai <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>The rise of Dongpi cloth has led to a gradual turnaround in business for Yunnanese gangs and guerrilla areas in Jiangsu and Anhui. Additionally, the market has been weak for many days, and merchants' inventories are gradually dwindling. Many people are taking a positive view. At this time, when market prices are low, there is a lot of absorption. Factories are taking the opportunity to sell some of their inventory in order to generate cash flow. As a result, trading has increased slightly, and the market has stabilized, with little difference from the previous week. The main street saw sales of 10,000 odd pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, coarse cloth, satin, and grey cloth. Over 5,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, printed cloth, and velvet were sold, mostly for dyeing and for resale in guerrilla areas. Yunnanese gangs have added 100 odd pieces of Dapeng, Fugui, fine cloth, fine twill, shilin cloth, and crepe de chine.

Cantonese gangs have purchased over 2,000 pieces of blue cloth, colored twill, and floral patterns. 62 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong on the 20th.</p>
<p>The Tianjin and Yantai gangs of the northern route were all purchasing Dong cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill yesterday, and merchants on this street were also eager to buy. The market continued to rise, with each piece surging 3 to 4 cents. The high price for Dragon Head Fine Cloth has already been bid for 18 yuan per piece, and Fine Twill 17 yuan. Colored goods, such as Four Gentlemen Serge and Zhigong, have also risen by more than one point per yard from Saturday.

Quite a few new hoarders have been absorbing stock, and the whole day saw sales of over 1,000 pieces of white goods.</p>

Please ask the Education Department to submit it to the provincial government meeting for decision.</p>

<p>Football star Wan Xianghua, the left winger "Dwarf Tiger" of the current Donghua football team, recently (on the 18th) left Shanghai on a Jardine Matheson ship to Hong Kong.

During this departure from Shanghai, friends and colleagues in the sports community were not able to bid him farewell, which he deeply regrets. He plans to see them again in the future.</p>

<p>Of the five West China League soccer cup competitions this season, the Zilin Cup already started the week before last. The International Cup has not yet been held. The Scott, Reserve, and Junior Cups all begin their first week of matches at the end of this week. A total of 14 teams are participating in the Scott Cup. The two giants, Donghua and Lido, are idle in the first week. Therefore, no Chinese Group A teams will play this week. Ten teams are participating in the Reserve Cup. Six teams are idle in the first week, namely Lido, Donghua, Dongseile, St. Francis, Lex and North West Children. Thirteen teams are participating in the Junior Cup. The teams idle in the first week are Mai Kaiping, Austin Meng and Hertzburg. In addition to the Group A teams, the participants in this year's Scott Cup include Jewish, Rowing, Socoer and Survey. Jewish has strong strength because it has added famous European refugees who came to Shanghai. Along with the rising Survey team, in addition to competing for the Group B championship, they also want to get involved in the Scott Cup. Their ambition cannot be said to be small. Lido, the champion of the last Scott Cup, hopes to win the title in Group A this year. Of course, they will not allow others to sleep soundly beside their bed. The Reserve Cup is a new product this season, and Lido will certainly not give it up. Lido was also the champion of the Junior Cup last season and will give it to others this season. In addition to the 13 cup matches this week, there are only two league matches in Group B. The schedule is as follows:</p>

However, because Donghua's generals were scattered, after discussion last night, it was changed to Lido and Donghua working together to fight against the West China League or the Military League. Personnel have been sent to contact the West China League, and it can only be determined after the West China League meets tomorrow to discuss it.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3 id="e102">A Brief Discussion on "Pornographic Literature" <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Dan</p>
<p>If "empty talk is enough to ruin the country," then why wouldn't "pornographic literature" exterminate the race!</p>
<p>Perhaps this is "alarmist talk"? The toxic ingredients contained in "pornographic literature" are definitely not as potent as heroin, because everyone knows that this is just "armchair strategy"; moreover, the currently popular erotic works not only cannot compare to the once popular "romance creations," even if they muster all their strength and desperately want to inherit the old mantle, they are obviously beyond their reach. Therefore, apart from attracting a few degenerate youths, "pornographic literature" is unable to expand its domain. Strictly speaking, the erotic works being produced now are simply not worthy of entering the literary world; if we acknowledge that this inferior current has literary value, it is tantamount to acknowledging that "erotic paintings" are works of art; crowning it with the golden crown of literature would be an insult to the sacred term. This view is naturally correct, but it only belongs to a distinction in nature, and has not taken into account the resulting effects and influence.</p>
<p>Those who defend erotic works must say that under the cold and depressing status quo, when a writer takes up a pen, it seems that someone is warning you, "Be careful!" Thus, a large number of erotic works are "born in response to the times." In fact, "be careful" is indeed a fact, but no one is forcibly grabbing anyone's wrist, writing things that destroy themselves.</p>
<p>However, there are many ways to defend it. It can also be said that people under the current situation need stimulation, especially high-spirited youths; then, the focus of the problem lies here. I think that there is nothing more effective for stimulation than opium or morphine. When you are constantly yawning, just inject a little into the bloodstream and you will immediately be refreshed; and a little bit, though insignificant, can sometimes converge into a torrent and cause people to suffer the disaster of drowning. Indirectly? There is no need to elaborate. It will invisibly weaken the courage to fight, obliterate the pure spirit of youth, and fulfill the wishes of those who pray for it.</p>
<p>We are definitely not moralists who want to raise any banner of defending morality, but the "talents of the foreign field" who are stepping up the creation of erotic works should not use "be careful" or "stimulation" as a reason to spread the poison that destroys society. Here, I must add another sentence: "Pornographic literature" cannot but exterminate the race!</p>
<h3 id="e103">Road Worker <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>The misty and moist wilderness was stripped of its hazy coat by the morning sun. The mountain roads and earthen dams all clearly showed a patch of mud. I moved my steps, and the sound of my footsteps was like the chirping of insects in the shallow grass.</p>
<p>The morning glow is like a gauze curtain. The layered scales of clouds stretched to the distant sky; the violet-colored and gentle light and shadow dyed the surroundings with clarity and tranquility. Outside the desolate suburbs, deep and solemn, no villages, no plowing hooves were seen, stirring the open and lonely space, only the bursts of singing brought by the morning wind from the highway. Singing that rough and passionate tune, they are a group that refines the earth.</p>
<p>Dark faces, bright eyes, crimson arms, hard palms, and robust bodies all reveal the vitality transformed by wind and rain. They wield hoes and harrows, and shoulder carrying poles. Some are filling small ponds, some are shoveling away high hills, and some are chiseling open upright rocks. Their arms are like bird wings, gently swinging in the high sky, and their legs advance steadily. Those narrow field roads, dilapidated villages, dense forests, rugged rocks, and cliffs are all melted into flowing liquid in the fiery vitality and condensed into a long road surface.</p>
<p>Climbing up the hillside, the road surface followed and spread upward, gradually, gradually widening the winding path and leveling the undulating mountain road like a snake's body. The soil rolled like waves, flying up many ink flowers.</p>
<p>I mingled among the road workers, secretly marveling at the steep terrain and the greatness of the project of opening roads across the mountains in my heart. I wanted to ask Section Chief Duan, but I understood: they are road workers, they have climbed peaks higher than the clouds: they have jumped into abysses thousands of feet deep; they have also traveled thousands of miles, enjoying the early spring in Jiangnan and the cold winter in the north; wild beasts, ice and snow, torrents, flowers... everything I think is rare, they may have seen it plainly. I finally suppressed my childish thoughts and changed the subject:</p>
<p>"The waterfall pours down, as clear as the Milky Way in the sky. The vine-covered cliffs are like a bride wearing a colorful veil. Being a road worker not only contributes to the motherland, but also has many wonderful encounters. It's a pity I don't have the strength."</p>
<p>"Ha... ha..." Before he could speak, a burst of laughter attracted two road workers behind him to ask.</p>
<p>"What are you laughing at? Is there wine to drink?"</p>
<p>"No, he's laughing at your strength. Hey! Friend: I ask you, how much road have you built? How much road have you traveled?" I replied with such a playful smile, and then took the lead in asking with such a serious attitude.</p>
<p>"I built for two years and four months, passing through eight provinces. I dug trenches and also dug tank traps."</p>
<p>"Your achievements are truly not small. You are comparable to soldiers who charge into battle." I said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Don't flatter people too much. When we get to Chaowangzhuang, I'll treat you to a drink. Ha..."</p>
<p>He dragged out a long laugh, turned around, carried the mud pole up the hillside, and waved it shovel by shovel.</p>
<p>Sweat sprinkled on the soil, and singing rose again in the open space:—</p>
<p>A carrying pole on the shoulder, regardless of cold or heat;</p>
<p>A hoe shoveling, regardless of rain or shine;</p>
<p>Hey yo ho yo... Ho yo hey yo!</p>
<p>Building one journey after another, striving to complete the mission of national revival!</p>
<p>I looked at their backs, and I listened to their free singing, as if I was intoxicated in an early spring garden, surrounded by vigorous vitality and fragrance! Joy surged into my heart, and I excitedly rushed to another mountain peak.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Yi He <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Di</p>
<p>The raindrops lingered in the long sky, and the haze swallowed some days. On the turbulent earth, some people sighed that life was drifting, like floating clouds, saying that they would hold on tightly to the hand of hope every fresh dawn, and then secretly let go with a sigh in the evening, as if joyful, and then sad!</p>
<p>When I occasionally thought about the Qing life melancholically with a naive heart, this drop of indelible trace lingered in my imagination for a long time, and a sigh fell lightly on my heart, but in my pupils I finally wove another beautiful picture. Who doesn't, in the cold wind and slanting rain, see the sunshine flickering and jumping for joy, like the loud sound waves of our childhood: "Oh, the bugle sounds in the daytime, the wind and rain are defeated, sigh..."</p>
<p>One day, the wind and rain will come violently, and in the wind and rain, the bugle will also sound loudly...</p>
<p>And at this moment, just like at a fork in the road, I vaguely heard the low whisper of the autumn wind again. Thinking: Under the bad soil, the plane trees by the road have become thinner, and what should be thinner is the "traveler's heart"...</p>
<p>At the fork in the road, my footsteps were stuck and stagnant; a mixed stream of thoughts messed me up like a stone thrown into the water, I would yearn for a happy life in the distance, for an iron belief, and a trace of cowardice entangled me again, stirring up my nostalgia for the local customs; the hazy days really made me have a longing, a little ashamed! And a few days ago, from the corner known as the crown, a friend sent me these words:</p>
<p>"...Here, the days are cloudy and the sway is still the same. A wisp of regret, like a ghost, is always waving in front of me. I am annoyed that I left you and crawled here. Looking at it for a few days, it is again 'the mountain rain is about to come, the wind is filling the building', and I am still like a vine, silently muddled. You say, who can forget pain like forgetting happiness? I really want to go back, to your side and walk in the same steps with you..."</p>
<p>I began to feel lost, and my vague footprints were still admired by someone. A wisp of sadness deeply criticized me—that friend's hope should still be written on the water... However, a resounding sound, beyond the distant Guanshan, drifted from another world's loud sound.</p>
<p>Ah, I dissected it.—</p>
<p>"...In the blue sky,浩刧 is often seen here, but in the misty smoke, our eyes are not moist. Do you know? Freedom is to be exchanged for flesh and blood, there is nothing cheap to fall. It is said that the Guanshan Mountains are thousands of miles apart, you should always hear our chest beating like tree roots shaking the soil in the summer night: See Lian will also be heroic and spirited, flying through the long sky, everything here is so beautiful like a rainbow, you should spread your wings and leap up, fly like Teng and breathe the same breath as us, we are thinking of you with a heart of blessing..."</p>
<p>Looking at the letter, and pushing open the window to look at the distant clouds and mountains, what a deep imagination: "Yi He soars to the Milky Way, with a proud posture and snowy frost." That scene will be seen quickly. Taking out white paper, I excitedly picked up the pen!...</p>
<p>"...Like you and me, there is equally nothing to miss here, but you are willing to take the same steps with me—good, fly up! Go to Lian's place where there is no loneliness... gallop, impact, it should always be like this... holding a heart of iron belief, towards that blood's banner. Bless us, let us also breathe the same breath as them..."</p>
<h3 id="e105">Dawn <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Pinpin</p>
<p>In my life, one of the sights that moved me the most was dawn. I have almost only seen such a dawn, I am very sleepy, and dawn often can't wait for me.</p>
<p>Last night, I went to see a friend who was staying in the school dormitory. I stayed and spent the night. I was really not used to it. I woke up at four and a half and walked to the campus alone.</p>
<p>The sound of the rooster that I vaguely heard in my dream is now even crisper. The crowing of a rooster is a good omen, probably a sunny day. Calm, but not the dead silence of the night. Two or three early-fallen leaves woke up on the muddy ground, gently jumping, and when they encountered dew, they stopped. Want to take a bath? Just right, a thin layer of heat has been shot down from the sky, and you won't get cold. The grass must be having a happy dream, otherwise why would it be so energetic? The big trees still stood upright and spirited, originally a team of honor guards, waiting for the arrival of dawn.</p>
<p>At the end is a river, and dawn can be seen in the river. The water is not turbid at all, but shines brightly, and still sounds very quietly. Birds accompanied the water to sing, chirping: "This person must be waiting for dawn."</p>
<p>I remembered Wordsworth's five-line poem:</p>
<p>The cock is crowing, the stream is flowing, The small birds twitter, The lake glitters, The green field is still unawakened under the light.</p>
<p>Light! I saw dawn! Light poured out from the clouds, golden, light red, egg white, woven into a brocade, leading to the gates of heaven. The sky unfolded like the chest of a giant, scaring the little birds into chirping and flying away. Everything was covered with light, bright, like newly carved gems. Majestic, open, vast, fresh, light! Unparalleled light! What can I use to praise you? I am running with open arms, my eyes burning with fire, and I feel that my soul is rising with the sunlight.</p>
<p>Dawn, creator of light, you are the gospel of mankind! How many people suffer in the darkness, and now, the shadows of demons flee, and people are saved. Dawn, the supreme dawn, you are the liberator, you are ours.</p>
<p>The long night will always pass, wake up, you who are sleeping, our dawn has loaded the light onto the flying car and is coming!</p>
<h3 id="e106">The Great Enemy of Harm to People <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>— (M.Chin.15)</p>
<p>In the report of Dr. Van der Heyden, a physician of the Dutch East Indies government, it is said: "Among the laboring masses in Southeast Asia, most of them seem to be infected with laziness. What is the reason for this? It is infection with malaria. This is indeed an important issue, and the government should have a way to improve it." Indeed, when malaria invades a coolie, his work efficiency will not be as high as when his body is healthy. However, not only coolies in the Dutch East Indies are like this, but also coolies in tropical areas such as British India and South America are all like this.</p>
<p>Indian Dr. Hariharam said: "In a plantation, if 200 workers are usually needed, if malaria occurs, it is necessary to increase the number of workers to 300 before it is possible." According to Dr. H.G.S. Morin: "Even in French Vietnam, it is necessary to do so." The two doctors have the same conclusion, so the intensity of malaria can be known from this!</p>
<p>Therefore, if you do not often prevent malaria in advance when operating in tropical areas, dare to believe that your business is prosperous, you must not be an opponent in other places.</p>
<p>In 1923, a severe malaria epidemic occurred in Russia. As many as 112,500,000 man-days were lost nationwide due to workers being unable to work due to the infection. In Italy, workers lose an average of 10,000,000 man-days per year due to malaria, and 20 million acres of land are taken out of cultivation due to malaria; for this reason, the Italian government posted warnings everywhere, ordering people to take precautions, saying that the harm of malaria to people is like an octopus (centipede) sucking people's marrow and blood, with insatiable greed. The metaphor can also be said to be appropriate and easy.</p>
<p>After collecting reports from all parties, the League of Nations Health Organization considered malaria to be a major enemy of mankind and advised residents that the simplest and most economical method of prevention is to take quinine. Those who suffer from this disease, if they take quinine, the disease will definitely not be prolonged. The method of taking it is to take about 15 to 18 centigrams per day when you are sick. After five days or a week, the disease will definitely heal. If you are unfortunately infected with this disease again in the future, then take it as before, and the disease will definitely go away, so there is no need to worry in vain. However, if you want to prevent it before it happens, or if you want to maintain your health when the weather is bad, you must take 6 centigrams of quinine; if you do this, malaria, no matter how strong it is, cannot harm you.</p>

<h3 id="e107">Introducing the Eleven-Year-Old Little Singer, Gloria Jean <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Qi</p>
<p>Gloria Jean (Editor's note: Wouldn't it be smoother to translate it as Gretchen?) This name may not ring a bell for people in Shanghai, as she's only made a single appearance. However, in the spotlight of Hollywood, she surpasses any child star. When her debut film, "The Little Tease" (to be shown in Nanjing), premiered at the Strand Theater, it was an unprecedented event. The theater was packed, needless to say. When she was at the theater entrance, the roofs of three cars were trampled on, all to get a glimpse of her true face!</p>
<p>Gloria Jean, this is her beautiful name, her last name is Schoonover, born in Buffalo, New York. As for her singing voice, even Deanna Durbin is a bit inferior. Although they both sing high notes, Deanna's songs are high-pitched ditties, while hers are high-pitched classics.</p>
<p>As for her singing history, it's not short either. At fifteen months old, she could already sing the entire song "Little Annie Rooney." At three and a half, she was already a radio singing star, and at five, her singing voice was enough to perform stage operas. This singing talent is truly a gift from heaven.</p>
<p>She is eleven years old this year, four feet eleven inches tall, weighs sixty-five pounds, with blue eyes and brown hair. As for "The Little Tease," in addition to this little singer, there is the director Richard Wallace, known for "Woman Chases Man," directed by Robert Cummings and Nan Grey, the protagonists of "Three Smart Girls," produced by Universal Studios.</p>

<h3 id="e108">Stone Spirit and His Peach Blossom Dream <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Xiao</p>
<p>I knew Stone Spirit six or seven years ago. At that time, I was editing a publication, and Stone Spirit submitted a novel about peasant life, which was very profound, serious, and melancholic.</p>
<p>Last year, Stone Spirit worked even harder in literary writing. On the one hand, he used a pen name to write popular novels, which were published in translation newspapers. On the other hand, he read a large number of popular literature works and theories.</p>
<p>But his most earnest effort was in drama. He created a one-act play, "Let Go of Our Grievances," he compiled the "Drama Section of the First Year," and he translated Ibsen's "John Gabriel Borkman," which was published in "Literary New Tide." Recently, he has a five-act play, "Peach Blossom Dream," being staged at the Lafayette Theater. The original name of this play was "When They Awake," (This title reminds one of Ibsen's "When We Dead Awaken.") The script is published by the World Book Company.</p>
<p>Today, I saw Stone Spirit on the street, and he asked me for my opinion on "Peach Blossom Dream."</p>
<p>"A thunderstorm-type drama, after Chen Xihe's 'Deep Abyss,' now there's another one from you," I said.</p>
<p>"No, my main purpose is not in the family aspect, but in its background. That is, Qingdao twenty years ago. That is to say, who caused this sin?" he said.</p>
<p>"That's right," I said. "Your meaning is very subtle. A great era has a literary style of its own, and you can only write like this. I often think of Dostoevsky's 'Eastern Fables.' Perhaps the current Shanghai literature will gradually move towards fables? Your one-act play is different in technique from your recent works."</p>
<p>We smiled knowingly, shook hands, and parted. I watched a tall and sturdy figure disappear in the bustling city.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Miscellany of Recent Days, Two Items <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Wei Xuan</p>
<p>Wu Suqiu's second performance in Shanghai was greatly welcomed by the local people. Coupled with farewell commemorations, the box office was booming. Even though Wang Yurong provided support as an old patron, she might not be able to surpass it. Suqiu has a beautiful appearance and a moderate figure, making her a top female performer of late. I watched the performance for two consecutive days, both at the invitation of friends, not to promote the show. I am just a humble soldier, not qualified to promote anyone, and even if I wanted to, people wouldn't recognize me. However, I am fortunate to have seen three excerpts over two days. It's a pity that the excerpts, such as "Spinning Cotton," "The Spider Cave," and "The Peach Blossom Smile," are all between the old and the new, and cannot fully demonstrate her true skills, which is regrettable. "Spinning Cotton" allowed us to see her original face. The lyrics imitating the "Five Flower Cave" of the four famous Dan performers and Xiao Cuihua's "Large Patching Jar" were the most brilliant. She played and sang herself, and the piano music felt slightly jerky, perhaps because she was a beginner. Her singing was gentle and pleasant, so the applause never stopped. "The Spider Cave" had graceful dancing and accurate singing, which was quite satisfactory. In short, Suqiu's expressions and charm all suit the tastes of Shanghai people, so it is no wonder that she became popular with just one performance. Li Duokui is the only talented Laodan (old female role) performer of today, but her singing is not as thick as Gong's, and her acting is not as substantial as Gong's. This is also limited by natural talent. It is regrettable that the audience was noisy, like a tea room, so even with Li's abundant energy, it was difficult to hear clearly. Could it be that the audience's level is so uneven? Liang Huichao can be summarized with eight characters: "nimble hands and feet, lively figure." Judging from her style, she should specialize in short combat scenes, and it will not be difficult for her to establish her own unique style in the future. Chen Shaolin only sang "Stealing the Soul Bell," appearing on stage for a few lines, plus two solo performances. Finally, he wrote the four characters "Farewell Commemoration," writing them upside down horizontally, and when you stand them up to look at them, they become reversed characters, which can be said to be unique. Since he didn't sing much, and only appeared on stage for this one performance, it was a bit too cheap. Last night, he sang "The Charcoal Basin," and the scenes of poisoning himself with medicine and grabbing a handful of dirt were quite brilliant. The long Erhuang aria was smooth and flawless. Sun Shengwu's performance as Zhang Biegu was just right. The closing act was Suqiu's "The Peach Blossom Smile," which was quite capable of expressing the inner feelings of the daughter. The ten sections of lyrics had many new tunes, but the Sipin tune sung in her illness was not as lingering and touching as Wan Hua's "Life and Death Hate." Suqiu is suitable for playing the role of a small, exquisite, and lively daughter from a modest family, and "The Peach Blossom Smile" fits her well, so her performance became a masterpiece. During the third act, Mr. Chang painted "Autumn Colors by the Fence," a branch of colored chrysanthemums, sparse and elegant. Mr. Yu Qiaqing took the stage to give a speech and start the auction, starting from 75 yuan to 100 yuan and 200 yuan. Finally, Mr. Zhang won the bid with the highest price of 400 yuan. Also, Mr. Hu Yaoting bid up to 110 yuan, and although he did not win the bid, he was willing to donate to the refugee relief association. (Editor's note: Suqiu painted a fan and gave it to Hu to express her gratitude.) Suqiu and Messrs. Zhang and Hu have done no small service to the refugees. I would like to offer two suggestions to the management of the Xinsheng Theater: (1) The female attendants should be extra attentive in showing people to their seats and serving water. (2) Shouting and selling food should be absolutely prohibited except during the five-minute breaks, so as not to disturb the audience's viewing and listening.</p>

<p>— Tian Ma</p>
<p>Since "August 13th," the Shanghai art movement has largely come to a standstill. Recently, drama and literature seem to have gradually come to life, and the music scene is also growing under this "revival movement."</p>
<p>Amateur musicians Chen Gexin, Zhang Hao, Zheng Shouyan, Qin Pengzhang, etc. recently jointly initiated the holding of a "Joint Music Concert," scheduled for 8:00 pm on the 22nd in the auditorium of the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge. This news is not only a major event in the music scene this year, but also the beginning of a new era of music and singing art after the war.</p>
<p>The performance program includes the Aippolo Harmonica Team; "Song of Shanghai," with male and female movie stars participating in the singing; Hawaiian music, played by Hu Jing, Jiang Maoshi, Xie Youqian, etc.; Qin Pengzhang's pipa. There will also be a large chorus of more than 100 people, conducted by Zheng Shouyan, with Chen Gexin personally accompanying. There will be a national music performance by the Yinyuan Silk and Bamboo Orchestra, a violin solo by Mai Xia, a solo by Ms. Qian Qi, and a soprano solo by Ms. Xu Ping.</p>
<p>The growth of music and singing is undeniably a part of the "isolated island" art revival movement. Let us wish it a bright future!</p>
<h3 id="e111">Unofficial History of the Pear Garden <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Old Actors Rely on Skill for Food; New Performers Rely on Pumping Up Ticket Sales to Make Money</p>
<p>Who knew that fate would not go as planned? Old Tan was an extremely intelligent man, and he immediately changed the "Yan Qian" rhyme to the "Miao Tiao" rhyme, singing, "One day passes after another, my heart is like boiling oil, a three-foot knife hangs empty at my waist, I can't watch my enemy be killed." It was seamless, and he didn't reveal any signs of shock or error. On the contrary, he received a full house of applause because of it, and his reputation was not damaged at all. From this, we can see even more the true skill of the old actors. Nowadays, when acting, even ten-year-old children have to bring their own ticket sales personnel, partners, and followers, all of whom are hired by themselves. All the major supporting roles in a play are brought along, and the high and low notes are completely under their own control. Not only is there no one on stage who competes with you or causes trouble, but even the stage manager can't mess with you. What's so difficult about acting like this? When Wang Yurong came south this time, in addition to the above-mentioned conditions that new performers should have (i.e., bringing their own supporting roles, stage settings, partners, costumes, etc.), she also had the old patron Wang Yaoqing helping her, and there were also prominent figures in Shanghai promoting her, so of course she could become a big hit. In recent times, performers want to earn a monthly salary of 18,000 as soon as they come on stage, but in reality, they don't have much amazing skill, so they have to rely on people to promote them. Sun Juxian once had someone offer him a monthly salary of 2,000 yuan, and he was so shocked that he said, "I, Sun, don't have much skill. I'm afraid I won't be able to sell many tickets after I go on stage, and I'll make you lose money. I'll return the 2,000 yuan in full, and we'll talk about it after the tickets are sold." (145)</p>
