<p>社評</p>
<h3>轟炸的功效</h3>
<p>以一般戰略而論，空軍轟炸敵方，除了軍事的直接功效，如毀滅據點，遮斷後援等等，此外選定若干城市為目標，亦不是前無先例的舉動。他的唯一理由，是破壞敵方的資力，以制敵方於死命，而自求勝利；故所選的城市，必是敵方工商鑛業命脈所繫的要害。。中國是農業國，資力蘊蓄於廣漠的田野，絕對不在一城一市；故日本空軍轟炸中國城市，是違反一般戰略原則的；至少亦是不能以一般戰略上的理由為論據的。但是事實不如此。旬日以來，日本空軍在炸重慶市區之後，又續在汕頭·福州·溫州·髯波·莫干山等不設防地域濫施轟炸·荼毒生靈。觀察日方的目的，無非以炸彈為工具，用以威脅中國民衆，沮喪中國士氣，動搖人民對抗戰必勝的信念，使抗戰的根基因此分化，實力因此削弱，以求完成其征服中國的野心。</p>
<p>我們深信這種觀察的準確，同時深知這種策略的無效。不但無效，並且收穫恰與期望相反。美國駐華大使詹森最近在舊金山對當地記者說：「日機恣意轟炸中國民衆居住中心點·徒使中國人民對日的敵愾愈益增高。」這是一針見血之談。而美國重要官員對於中國國民性。能如此明暸透澈，即是中美邦交輯睦的重要因素吧！中國人的同仇敵愾，由抗戰鍛鍊而成；日本炸彈的隆隆轟炸，却無異於帮助鍛鍊，更重重的加了無數鎚！</p>
<p>靜觀戰局，華軍自始採取「消耗戰」策略，最近又以「流動戰」為策略，使日軍「疲於奔命」，在各戰塲上，已取得主動地位，獲得了初期的勝利。這證明了華軍的作戰能，運用無窮，漸决增强。反之，日軍則已更進一步暴露力量的薄弱和軍事上進展的困難。這種新形勢的展開，當然使日本感覺恐慌，祗因為野心未戢，乃竭力挣扎；對利用政治上的權力，把總動員法，全部實施，以作孤注一擲；對外則以比較優越的空軍，向中國各地濫施轟炸作為宣傳戰績的資料，用以代替勝利的消息。</p>
<p>在最近幾决的轟炸中，列强在華的利益，也遭受了極大的損失，甚至領館使館，亦成了轟炸的目標。雖日本海軍少將金澤，於轟炸重慶之後。發表聲明，略謂日本空軍，僅以中國的軍事設備為轟炸目標，但彈片的波及是不能避免的。然而重慶英領事館花園中炸有一個二十四呎周圍的巨洞，這豈得謂彈片波及的結果。不但如此，日本陸軍喉舌國民新聞，竟發表恫嚇英國駐華大使寇爾爵士個人安全的言論；對於毫無軍事設備的莫干山上的美國敎會財產，亦不免於被炸。於此我們不能不回想抗戰初期，英國駐華大使許閣森，在京滬國道上被日機掃射；美國軍艦泊於長江，被日機轟炸；事後日本對英美兩國，提供了以後不再發生同樣事件的保　。但最近轟炸重慶，轟炸莫干山，又把他自己保證的信用炸毀了。　中國抗戰是世界各民治國家的前衛，凡同情於中國的國家，對於日本的這種暴行，是萬不會漠視的；利害所關，公道所在，終必拿出更切實的力量，來制裁這種暴行；促成制裁。這又是轟炸的收穫吧！</p>

<p>戰後沿海都市相繼淪陷、戰區紗廠大部已燬於砲火、即能倖免者、則內部機件、亦已不全、同時日方企圖武力接管、所以決無恢復之可能、惟楊樹浦之振華紗廠紗錠一萬三千九百二十八枚、因「市民協會」尤菊孫之關係、經日方核准由合記承租、照常開工紡織、戰區以內各廠已為日方接管開工者、有申新、永安等廠、但與原有各廠毫無關係、全由日方之非法接收開工、且其中有若干廠有外商關係、日方亦予不顧、雖經交涉無效、</p>
<p>租界新廠　十家開工</p>
<p>淪陷區域內各紗廠一律堅決拒絕日方之合作、情願犧牲營業、另在上海租界區域內　設新廠、惟多係以英美等外商名義設立、業已開工者、據新聲社記者調查所得、（一）信和二萬五千紗錠、（二）協記二千六百紗錠、（三）安達一萬五千紗錠、（四）台豐一萬五千紗錠（五）新生一萬六千紗錠、（六）肇興六千紗錠、（七）榮豐一萬五千紗錠、（八）中紡二萬紗錠、（九）德豐八千三百紗錠、（十）寳豐一寓紗錠、以上總計十家、其中新生協記、</p>
<p>原有開工　各廠紗錠</p>
<p>全係華資、已開工各廠、在戰前原有之紗錠、（一）申新第二紡織廠五萬六千紗錠、（二）申新第九紡織廠八萬九千紗錠、（三）新裕第一廠二萬五千紗錠、（四）新裕二廠二萬四千紗錠、（五）鴻章二萬四千紗錠、（六）永安第三廠六萬三千紗錠、（七）大同紗廠四千七百紗錠、（八）統益紡織廠四萬七千紗錠、（九）動豐紡織廠四千三百紗錠、（十）崇信紡織廠三萬四千紗錠、以上總共十家、崇信·統益·兩家、係英商註册、申新二廠、已歸美商企業公司管理、</p>
<p>日商在滬　所有紗廠</p>
<p>日商在滬之紗廠已開工者、（一）日華紡織廠第三第四第五第六第七、紗錠共十七萬四千八百十六枚、綫錠四萬二千二百九十六枚、（一）內外棉株式會社第一至第九、紗錠共二十八萬零五百三十六枚、綫錠十一萬一千八百八十枚、布機三千八百台、（三）上海紡織公司第一第二第三、紗錠共十一萬九千零二十四枚、綫錠二萬三千三百二十枚、布機二千三百零四台、（四）同興紡織會社紗錠九萬七千枚、綫錠二萬零二百四十枚、布機一千四百十二台、（五）公大東華大康豐申裕豐、紗錠共四十四萬一千九百四十枚、綫錠共八千二百枚、布機七千台、</p>
<p>英商怡和　綸昌各廠</p>
<p>英商在滬原有各廠、今已完全恢復開工、（一）怡和紡織公司、怡和公益楊樹浦紗錠四萬零九百七十六枚、布機二千一百三十五台、（二）綸昌紡織漂染印花有限公司綫錠三千六百四十枚、布機一千一百三十台、英商出紗之廠僅公益一家、共所產之紗、尙不足其他三廠織布之用、而須購買中日紗廠之紗綫、至於綸昌紡織公司、聞已裝有紗錠四萬四千枚、竭力設法擴充、以求實行自紡自織自染之政策、但目前英紗之流動市塲上者、為崇信統益及新設之信和安達等廠所產之紗、</p>
<p>壟斷原料　訂購外棉</p>
<p>日本以其全力、搜集我國淪陷區域棉花、運日充作工業及軍火原料後、於是運日棉花數量激增、去年出口棉花値國幣一萬零一百萬零零三千二百二十四元、今年第一季棉花出口値國幣三百五十二萬七千零二十一元、上海各紗廠因棉花為日方所壟斷、以致發半原料缺乏恐慌、不得已向印度埃及美國巴西等處、訂購外棉運滬接濟、去年全年棉花進口為一千二百七十三萬五千零四十四元、今年第一季棉花進口竟增至二千六百五十七萬九千一百十三元、</p>
<p>日商企圖　壟斷紗業</p>
<p>上海於戰後因紗廠新設者激增、依然成為中外紗廠萃會之處、各地紗價、均依上海市塲為標準、今華商紗布交易所、迫於環境、迄無恢復開拍之希望、惟日商已組織一棉業取引所一、地址二馬路金業交易所舊址、有定七月一日開業之說、至於紗銷、江浙皖以及華北各省、淪鵈區域以內、已為日紗所壟斷、華紗幾已絕跡、惟華紗之銷地為西周六各省以及非淪陷區域、關於上海市之紗銷、亦為日紗刦奪、因日紗價格、在華紗之下故也、</p>

<p>主管機關　倡導監督</p>
<p>各米業團體僅處協助地位、故人心易於折服、限價不難維持、今則時異勢遷、情形特殊、各米業團體不自量力、組織敝委員會、以為社會服務、然二月以來、力竭聲嘶、來日方長、前途可虞、實有非敝委員會所能勝任者、補救之策、惟有懇請鈞局派員參加、隨時指示機宜、俾米業有所遵循、市况得以安定、且米價之穩定與吾、直接有關民食、間接影響治安、諒鈞局必能允予參加也、其二、欲求米價之平準、限價·調查·登記等、均係治標辦法、至治本之策、端在謀來源之豐富、若來源阻滯、而僅賴現有存米、雖嚴訂限價、終難維持於不敝、處今日情形之下、欲使來源豐富、僅有二途可循、一為擬請鈞局仿照前年成例、訂購大宗洋米、運滬儲備、則民食自可無虞、米價即易壓平、二為擬請鈞局設法疏通內地來源、蓋蘇省米糧、以無錫地方為集中點、皖省以蕪湖地方為集中點、向來滬地食糧、粳秈二種、大批取給於該二地、今此二地業已先後禁阻米糧運出、近日滬地來源之稀、市價之漲、其主因即在於是、販米客商、尙有薄利可圖、無不竭力購運、而乃格於情勢、徒喚奈何、惟有</p>
<p>仰賴鈞局　設法疏通</p>
<p>務使大宗產米無錫·蕪湖·二地、每日或每月、各有相當數量、運輸至滬、源源不絕、則其效果亦與訂購洋米相等、務懇鈞局於此二者、擇一施行、則勝於各項治標方法多多矣、以上所陳、一為懇請參加評價委員會之組織、二為懇請訂購洋米、或疏通內地來源、皆為目前急要之務、至祈鈞局准予所請、允予照辦、迫切陳詞、無任企禱、又</p>
<p>存米登記　昨日開始</p>
<p>定期一週、至十八日結束、據悉本市米號業·豆米行業·碾米業·經售米糧業·等同業公會、及常熟米公所·南帮米公所·滬北運米客商聯益會·等米業團體、均已分別轉知所屬同業、於限期內逕至愛多亞路　五號豆米行業公會塡表登記、否則即陳報租界當局、昨日首日前去領表者頗為踴躍、至於豆米市塲自切實執行限價後、市塲情形、漸趨穩定、並推委員四人負責遂日評定河下早稻價格、再行出售、各帮販運客商、亦竭力向產地採購、疏通來源、以便穩定滬市民食、又米糧評價委員會除建議兩租界當局採購洋米運滬接濟外、並擬於今日再行致函市商會、請派員參加指導、</p>

<h3>大戰爆發後　上海將如何　似將轉變為工業城市　日或保護德意之財產　金融評論家阿勒斯之推測</h3>
<p>大陸報云，本埠金融評論家阿勒斯、撰文刋本期密勒氏評論週報、題名「大戰如爆發上海如何」、略稱、如歐洲發生戰事、民治國與全能國各處一營壘中、結果、上海之外國商業、將停頓甚久、而蒙受損失、但亦將予本埠工業家以刺　、</p>
<p>歐戰發生</p>
<p>後、上海似將轉變為工業城市、又戰起後、上海之航運便利、將立見奇缺、蓋大多數外輪將被本國徵用也、大戰之其他影響、為（一）民治國輸滬貨物减少、（二）全能國輸滬貨物、完全停止、（三）物價高漲、（四）歐幣跌價、最後為本埠證券交易暴跌、及宣佈</p>
<p>延期還債</p>
<p>阿氏評論敵對國在滬之地位云、雖預料日本將擴張保護此間之德意財產、但大致將保守中立、同時民治國在此間亦不致企圖沒收德意之商業利益、蓋恐</p>
<p>此種行動</p>
<p>、或將予日本以對公共租界及法租界有所行動之必要藉口也、阿氏末言、中國資本家自中日戰起後集中上海、亟欲投資於獲利之事業、因而促進上海之工業化、</p>

<h3>西區盜案多起　一盜生擒</h3>
<p>滬西檳榔路第三五九至三六一號某工廠內、於昨午十一時半左右、突遭匪徒三名闖入行刦、若輩均持有手槍、直闖入該廠帳房間、將所有職員悉予看禁、並打開銀櫃、將內貯鈔洋四百餘元、悉行搶去、奪鬥逃逸、不料斯時適有華捕經過經廠方吿以所遇、乃亟拔槍追趕、當殿後一盜生擒、帶入捕房覊押、並兜捕同黨、</p>

<h3>毒販王天新　判罪不服上訴　昨開合議庭十八日宣判</h3>
<p>海門人王天新，當八一三戰事發生之前、在閘北虬江路與人夥開協鑫隆公記玩具廠、營業頗不惡、略有儲積、嗣因該廠燬於砲火、遂爾失業、爰乃另謀出路、以年來獲利最優之事業莫過於販賣毒品、王與其妻向住靑島路四十五弄四號、其姘婦沈氏、則住同弄三十三號、為保持</p>
<p>販毒秘密</p>
<p>計、所有海洛英嗎啡精等各種毒品、概藏於沈氏之處、如有買主向購、須先到四號交付價款、然後引往卅三號取貨、且須躉批、而不零售、故自販賣以來、從未敗露、所賺金錢、亦屬不貲、直至本年三月間、該瞥新閘捕房葉融探長始有所聞、特遣人將法幣五元、往四號購買、王初以其數微拒之當經其人詭言所買者僅作樣子、如經</p>
<p>試驗貨品</p>
<p>果佳、尙須陸續大量採辦、王纔售給、翌日、葉副探長即率同中西探捕馳至三十三號沈氏臥室、搜查之下、共獲海洛英一百二十四兩、嗎啡精二十四兩、估値一萬餘金、並抄出售毒所得現鈔一千五百餘元、及販毒簿據等物、繼往四號將王天新王沈氏拘獲、解由第一特區地方法院、初審終結、判決王處</p>
<p>無期徒刑</p>
<p>沈氏處徒刑十二年、毒品及售毒之資、分別沒收在案、詎該毒販猶自妄冀逃罪、具狀高二分院、强辯該項毒品、係顧渭城寄存、而非彼所有要求廢　原判、並欲發還沒收之款、昨日下午由郁庭長開合議庭飭提該兩男婦到案、訊以上訴理由、沈氏僅稱物係顧所寄存、伊由鄉間來申不久、且不明所存為毒品王天新則一味推諉、郁庭長旋將全案卷宗審核之下、深以該犯前後</p>
<p>供詞矛盾</p>
<p>百出、顯係諱飾狡賴、即命開始辯論、於是捕房律師甘鏡先首以該犯販毒之事實物證充足、罪無可逭、應請依法懲治、將其上訴駁斥、旣而王與其姘婦之律師范剛俞恩良鄥鵬相繼辯護一過、末由林檢察官起而論吿後、庭諭定期本月十八日下午宣判、王天新王沈氏分別還押、</p>
<h3>偽「局長」盧英汽車　與火車相撞　劉祥雲孔才福均重傷</h3>
<p>社聞社云、前日下午五時二十五分左右、有偽「市警察局長」盧英之汽車、在江灣路與火車猛撞、致當時有二人遭受重傷、緣是日下午四時許、盧乘坐四穴一二號黑牌自備汽車，由「局」回狄思威路寓所、由汽車夫孔才福駕駛、惟盧自回寓後、因有其他要務、特派隨盧之劉鮮雲者赴閘北警所一接洽、仍命孔駕駛前往、甫目狄思威路折向江灣路之際、遙見有日方之軍用火車、由吳淞開回上海、此時孔雖見火車到來、但仍欲竄過軌道、並開足速率、向前直衝、不料火車之速率、亦甚急快、致猛撞於該汽車之援車廂、砰然一聲、該汽車向天翻身、幸遠拋全數丈之遠、惟劉坐於開車之旁、被汽車之玻璃及鐵片擦傷頗重、面部幾無完膚當即昏厥、而開車之孔才福、亦氣息奄奄、當經日海軍所派江灣路之哨兵聞悉、乃將受傷之劉孔二人、從車中拖出、急電召救護車到來、送往福民醫院救治後、經該院醫生、連打數决强心針、始得獲救、現仍在暈迷中、生命殊危、而孔傷勢稍輕、但醫治亦頗費時日云、</p>
<h3>日機低飛偵察</h3>
<p>滬西虹橋路中山路斜土路一帶上空、近數日來、時常發覺日機一兩架、低飛偵察、或上下盤旋、形同練習、詎咋日上午又有日機一架、在滬西犬空往來飛舞、嗡嗡之聲、不絕於耳、約一時許、去而復來者數决、至下午二時許、又有雙翼轟炸機三架、在龍華漕河涇一帶上空、往來追逐、上下飛舞、環繞數匝後、始向西南方面飛去、然證諸連日浦南中日軍之激戰、則日機之出動、或為偵察華軍之動靜、</p>

<h3>家庭細故何必涉訟　翁訴寡媳返家　庭諭兩造和解免傷感情</h3>
<p>現住滬西海格路融和里八號江蘇海門人董滌靑、今年五十六歲、延施霖律師代理、具狀向特二法院民庭、對於寡媳董王徵蘭（二十九歲）與孫董永麟（八歲）母子二人、（現住海格路衛樂園九號母家）提起回家共同生活之訴、據原告訴狀略稱、原吿之長子董實權、娶第一被吿為室、生有一子、即第二被吿、不幸實權於二十三年八月初六日病故後、原吿對被吿母子</p>
<p>加意愛護</p>
<p>此次因被難來滬、同住一處、不料第一被吿於六個月之前、携同其子即第二被吿歸寗母家、一去不回、屢决派人去接、置之不理、惟第二被吿正在學齡時間、原吿已為繳付學費、因由被吿携去、不能入校求學、迫不得已、訴請判令被吿等回家、共同生活云云、法院據狀、於昨日午後由陳推事開民七庭傳訊、原吿董滌靑偕代理律師到案、</p>
<p>聲述前情</p>
<p>被吿董王徵蘭董永麟母女、委趙勛肅律師出庭稱、第一被吿之挈子住在娘家、係極平常之事、據第一被吿董王徵蘭吿本律師云、彼於十八年嫁與原吿長子董寳權為室、生有一子、名永麟、即第二被吿、不幸丈夫於二十一二年故世、被告矢志撫孤、無如翁姑不加憐愛、對被吿之患病醫藥及小孩費用</p>
<p>均不顧問</p>
<p>而對其餘小叔等、咸非常照顧、迨戰事發生、鄕間淪陷、原吿率同家人等悉行來滬避難、對被吿母子棄之不顧、被吿因在鄕間、不能居住、携子到母家居住、對小孩之讀書、已請一位張芝芳先生敎讀、現在被吿並非絕不肯回家、而原吿方面亦不能令被吿</p>
<p>絕對不許</p>
<p>到母家云云、至此、庭上勸諭原告本案為家庭間極細小之事、何必涉訟、相見法庭、還是託人勸導、免傷情感、且本案如經過審判之後、將來家庭間之情感、愈更惡劣、遂諭知雙方代理雜師出外向兩造勸導和解、本案改期再訊、</p>

<p>上海特輯</p>
<h3>上海公共租界之犬政（上）</h3>
<p>— 陳斌棠</p>
<p>關於這個問題我們可由三方面着想：</p>
<p>公共租界對於路犬之處置及關於狗所得財務之概况</p>
<p>上海護畜會之與犬</p>
<p>上海公共租界對於瘋狗治療之設施</p>
<p>（一）關於公共租界對於路犬之處置可分述如决：租界當局，因鑒於無主之路狗，可釀成界內最危險之瘋狗病，以是每日由捕房派出二捕犬車，往各馬路巡查，凡狗未戴口罩或無執照者，均在被捕之例，逕載赴戈登路捕房之狗獄內共六十八室，（楊樹浦捕房內亦有狗獄設置，現以戰事關係，故未能使用），待十日，如該狗無人領取，則此狗即山捕房另覓新主，（狗費五元，執照五元半）或窒滅之。昔時，窒滅之狗，常為附近鄕人購食，後為捕房所悉，禁止購買，於是工部局乃將狗皮售於的定商人，而另備機器煉出狗油，以作製白一之原料，凡狗之疑有瘋狗病者，則由捕房送赴虹口（Sawgin　Rd.）（此番戰事由戈登路捕房暫理）之診察獄（Obdervation　Kennel）（見附表三）如逾二十天後，無瘋狗現象者，則送還原主，如驗有瘋狗病者則火焚之。至若戈登路之狗獄，內有拘禁所共六十八個，因拘於該所之狹小，故祗能適合狗貓之用，其他如馬類等，大型動物，均不在此例，而每年狗類之因無主認領而窒死者，數以千記，（見附表二）其收入當甚可觀，至若執照價目，向有規定，每具售洋五元五角，不計大小及種類。平均每年所發執照數目，的二三千張之譜，其收入平均的一萬左右，凡該部開支，如狗之食料，職員之薪水等，每年均有盈餘。</p>
<p>（甲）歷史—該會創自一九零四年，當時工都局藉會審公廨之力，得將保護牲畜，列為捐照時條件之一，故畜主凡有抵觸保護牲畜之條件者，由會審公廨執行罰款，此類罰款，即作該會經費之一部，但自會審公廨廢止後，而中國法律於維護牲畜，又無明文規定，於是罰款之執行等等，漸見困難而各方於該會之興趣，亦漸减少，其間一度之會員祗二十人，而辦事員亦惟一人而已，常時該會所受經濟壓力，可稱已極，旣無一定辦公地址，又乏年常報吿書，若是相持有年，迄一九三二年，一二八上海事變，該會循社會需要，即行復辦，蓋當時工部局等於極力救濟難民外，復從事於牲畜之救濟，然以人力有限勢難兼顧，故該會即於救濟聲中，重新組織矣。時逾一載，該會事務，日見增加，於是臨時書記等職員，亦照常復員，而年報亦刊印如舊，此後，其會員一躍自二十人至八百人，進步之速，實堪欽佩，不唯各市塲之檢查員，相繼復行，而一藍十字年刊」亦於一九三六年，開始印</p>
<p>（乙）宗旨及入會之手續—該會宗旨為改少牲畜之痛苦，而於可能範圍中，覓取保護之方法，一方面固特各職員及社會人士努力之勸化，及當局法律上之援助，而普遍敎育，猶所計及也，至於入會手續甚簡，該會會員亚無國籍限制，亦無男女之別，入會年費國幣五元，永久會員則為二十元，附送「藍十字一年刊（今歲每月刋行），該會現正努力使成為國際化，內有職員，至少屬十五國家。</p>
<p>（丙）工作情形之一斑（一）工作情形，因拘性質關係，而處處對於社會改良，有未便公佈之艱，恐有礙於未來與各界之合作，然有極普通之工作若動物在運輸時之保護，可略述之。該會每遺檢查員數人，於車站或碼頭上，考察所運牲畜，如吾相當安全，若牽牛之繩，不可縛於鼻上而須縛於角上，父如麥根路車站，經該會之請求，由車站裝置水櫃一個，再供牲畜解渴之用，叉裝載豕類之卡車過重時，須科罰鍰，上述等等，自經各糾察員努力訓導之下，已大見成效矣</p>
<p>（二）無主路犬之辦理凡屬無主之路犬或病犬經該會捕得後，即由該會獸醫，加以治理，遇病情之重者，醫師認為無治療之必要，即窒滅之，（自一九三二年迄今計共二二七八頭）其他路犬，則由該會另覓新主，時日經久，而仍未獲新主者，則與重疾狗同樣處理，各糾察員除擔任巡查外且時赴各醫院，參與各動物之檢驗，凡　與動物生活有關者，當盡力提出以供研究。</p>
<p>（三）敎育上之宣傳　鑒於敎育於維　牲畜之重要，該會常赴各學校，分發徵章及廣吿，且於一九三三年，有校際關於護畜之論文比賽，一九三五年，又有幼童招貼比賽，該時賴各社國之合作，參加比賽之華童學校，竟達七百之多，其成績可想而知，嗣後關於預防及各類敎育工作均將施　學校，如經濟豐裕，或將略備獎品，以資鼓勵。</p>
<p>（丁）該會今後之希望（A）中國護夣法律之產生—吾國之法律迄今尙無「人道法」之審定，因此該會工作，頗多礙滯，蓋法律不能予以相當之援助與實力，回顧此類徘徊態度，影響於社會道德者如何，其於一國文化之進展又當如何，譬若一人猛將貓頭砍下或將一犬擊死等，因無法律規定，可吿無罪，凡此種種，如不加以制止，他日流弊，誠不堪設想，故該會現正極力設法，使中國法規亦有護畜之規定。（按八一三事變前，吾國佛敎會，亦有護畜會之發起，且於大塲設立之放生院，其時該兩會互相合作，後以八一三事發，大塲之放生院不幸燬於砲火）</p>
<p>（B）經濟上之援助該會現在所租會址，係由跑馬廳免費租借，（馬霍路一八四號）惟其他如糾察員及書記之薪水等等，均須開支，按一九三六年所捐及會費收入的共七·二八九元，而支出獸翳及薪水等，共八·六五四元，計透支一千三百餘元，但該會並不以此停頓，因社會道德正待提倡流傳各地，設上海該會停止，則內地響應者，勢必失所憑依矣。深願同胞中，能慷慨解囊，則諸畜　甚矣。</p>
<p>狂犬病之大槪情形——在犬病原為狗類之一種疾病，雖其他獸類，如猫與馬及牛等，亦有傳染者，目豺狼　設被咬傷，即能有在犬病傳染之可能，但中國動物中所當畏懼者，通常僅為貓與犬，但馬類亦曾有染此病者，其他牲畜絕少傳染此病，至若在犬病之傳染極簡，患在犬病之牲畜之涎沫即可傳佈此病，在病狀未發現一星期之前，涎沫已含有毒質，倘為此種牲畜所咬，或使其涎沫觸及皮膚傷破之處，均可傳染狂犬病，人在整理狗之口套，或拔出狗喉間之骨，或給狗服藥時，皆有傳染在犬病之危險，而狗類最易感染此病，有時其破裂之爪，偶或觸及患在犬病者涎沫，即可染此病，甚至在追尋其他在犬時，亦能經由鼻孔而傳染，犬類之得有在犬病，大概以貓傳染者最為常見，蓋花園之普通圍籬，不足防阻瘋貓之入。</p>
<p>狂犬病之普通徵象（甲）患狂犬病之狗，先不進食，精神萎靡，且發熱，繼則不安靜而起臥不停，平素極熟之人，當可見其性情驟變，時或懇摯可親，時則乖戾易怒，凡此現象，固為前所未有者。（乙）患狂犬病之狗，無論病勢深淺，其吠聲可比平時為低，而類似銅響，頗為特別。試以言語形容之，可稱為一種短促之怒　，而隨以數聲參差不一之吠聲</p>
<p>狂犬病之種類（甲）狂暴性之狂犬病——患此類病之狗，輒向空亂咬，或離家出外，歷一二日之久，歸時形容憔悴，身受創傷，性情盡改，而且咬人，然人之被咬，則大都由於誤會「在暴性」之名稱，以為旣經稱為在暴，其狀態當然如此，詎所見者乃一病狗，沿途奔走時垂頭喪氣，間或步能蹣跚，並時或咬嚙途中所遇之物，致不防為瘋狗，行路者其愼　。</p>
<p>戰前之上海市建設　（三）　琳琅</p>
<p>河道海塘上海市河道錯綜，大都通潮，極易淤塞。十年來疏浚之河道，總長一〇四·〇三一公尺，挖出土方二，八〇六，八一四立方公尺，共用工程費六十八萬七千七百二十五元一角。主要工程為疏浚吳淞江，蒲滙塘，及滬南碼頭區挖泥等。上海市所轄東西衣周三塘，共的長二十四公里有奇，年久失修，險象環生。市工務局於十八年六月接管塘工，至二十一年六月及二十三年九月，先將最危險之部份，加以修築。共用工程費六十八萬六千餘元。</p>
<p>自來水經營上海市自來水事業者，共計四處。其中市辦者兩處，卽上海市公用局之給水處，及市興業信託社之浦東水廠（見另條）；屬於商辦者為內地自來水公司，與閘北水电司。其初—民國十六年時，內地閘北兩水廠，每日出水總數僅達七六，八〇〇立方公尺，水質亦極汚濁，歷經市公用局督飭改善，添置設備。至二十六年夏，內地公司每日出水達九七，〇〇〇立方公尺；閘北公司每日出水量增至六八，二〇〇立方公尺。以之供給各該營業區域之用，水量頗為充足。至水質方面，亦經市公用局與市衛生局規定淸潔標準，經化驗結果，均在標準之內，頗為純净。該兩公司於戰前尙有舉辦添建水廠等設備工程，當時預計擴充之後，可增加出水量，內地公司為六八，〇〇〇立方公尺，閘北公司為三五，八〇〇立方公尺。市公用局所辦之給水處，於二十二年七月成立，轉　自來水於徐家滙海格路一帶，及停泊滬南碼頭輪船之用水。二十四年二月，市公川局又與閘北水電公司訂的，由該公司承辦吳淞區之自來水供給。擴充內地及閘北水廠之經過情形，大致如次：民國十六年時，兩廠出水數量，均不足以供給各該公司營業區域之需要，以致閘北徐家滙等處，均會由外商自來水公司越界供給。市公用局成立後，一再督促兩廠擴充設備，增加水量，以應市民需要。至二十一年六月，內地公司新建之快瀝池，混凝沉澱池等工程完成，於是每日出水量即大增。至二十四年，內地閘北兩公司營業區內，户口增加頗速，於是再添建混凝沉澱池，快瀝池及水塔等工程。預計全部工程完竣後，內地公司可增加出水量至一六五，〇〇〇立方公尺，閘北公司可增加至一〇四，〇〇〇立方公尺。若以平均每人每日用水量，內地公司一一五公升，閘北公司八五公升計算，則內地司霄當可供給人口一百五十萬，閘北公司亦可供給一百二十萬人。若以近十年該兩公司營業區域內人口增加率推算，則以該兩公司之出水量計，均可維持供給至十年以上也。收回越界給水，亦為公用局成立後所辦主要事務之一。上海市區各處，曾為外商越界給水者，有滬北，滬西，及徐家匯等處。除滬西方面，二十六年時，由公用局依照中央所定原則，與上海滬西自來水公司籌備委員會，籌商組織中外合資之滬西自來水公司外，所有滬北及徐家滙兩處，已經分別收回。滬北方面向由英商上海自來水公司越界給水，其範圍已由閘北而及於引翔鄕。公用局一面制止該公司推廣路綫，一面督促閘北水電公司擴充設備，以資替代。二十年七月，又經閘北公司與上海公司簽訂合同，由閘北公司收買上海公司在華界道路上所佔設之全部水管，其越界築路兩旁上海公司原有用戶，以閘北公司名義給水。徐家滙一帶給水，原由法商電車電燈公司越界供給，其後雖有收回之意，祇以內地水公司能力不足而未實行。二十二年間，公用局成立給水處，先行籌備徐家滙及滬南碼頭船舶用水。二十二年九月底，法商與內地公司辦理交替手續；二十三年二月間，公用局又與法商公司辦理改接手續，於是徐家匯一帶之給水，先後收回；均由公用局之給水處，轉饋內地公司之水，以資應用。</p>
<p>電氣上海市電氣事業由華商電氣公司，閘北水電公司，浦東電氣公司，翔華電氣公司，眞如電氣公司，及滬西電力公司等六家，各就該公司營業區域，分別經營。除滬西電力公司為中外合資所經營，不自發電，饋用上海電力公司電流外，其餘各公司均為國人所經營。二十六年時，華商電氣公司之發電總容量為一六，〇〇瓩，閘北水電公司為二二，五〇〇瓩，浦東公司為六〇〇瓩，以之供給市內五個電氣公司用戶之川，尙嫌不足。曾經市公用局督促閘北華商兩公司擴充設備。閘北水電公司添置之一二，五〇〇　發電機一具，戰前已完工發電；後以發電量尙感不敷，續訂同樣之一二，五〇〇瓩發電機一具。華商電氣公司添置之一五，〇〇〇瓩汽輪發電機兩部，截至戰事發勸時，尙在建設之中。其時浦東電氣公司亦在建設一〇，〇〇〇瓩之發電廠一所。滬西滬北之電氣，向由租界方面越界供給，由來已久。迭經市公用局與上海電力公司交涉，並經上峯核准，遂於二十四年一月間簽訂合的，成立滬西電力股份有限公司。該公司股份之分配，計華股佔百分之四十九，外股佔百分之五十一，完全受上海市政府之監督。至於滬北方面，自經滬西電力公司成立後，上海電力公司即將滬北越界供電部份，分批交出；惟因種種關係，閘北水電公司，截至二十六年夏，尙未能完全收回耳。</p>
<p>電話　上海市電話事業，除租界區域由美商上海電話公司經營外，所有滬南，閘北，江灣，浦東等處，均由交通部上海電話局經營。數年以前，市區內電話頗不為市民所滿意，其後該局力謀擴充，並將人工接綫機改為自動電話機，通話靈敏，用戶大增。截至二十六年夏，計有用戶四，七二七家，自動電話機四，九五〇鬥，人工接綫電話機一，〇五〇門。市區內用戶之使美商上海電話公司服務者，為數亦頗不鮮，迭經市公用局會同交通部上海電話局，與該公司交涉，於二十二年四月問，簽訂電話臨時合的，規定上海電話公司營業區域，及其應盡應享之權利義務，以為收回市區及越界築路區之電話裝置權之先聲。　（未完）</p>

<p>洋粉仍見平靜、北洋幫前會一度動辦、今已觀望不前、蓋天津方面、洋粉充盈，市價已受重大打擊故也、惟申市人心尙佳、乃國外產價頻昂、期貨早難合劃、且與新麥上市軋脚、故亦無人問津、市上存到之現洋粉、大都待價而沽、不顧輕脫、故市面續居　持、中檔牌子價為四元五角至四角半、與本粉相仿、而交易頗為淸閑、</p>
<h3>高客秈與　本尖一樣賣　北粳高貨暗盤　有超過十六元</h3>
<p>昨日杜梗各帮來源、河下未到、而車輪包子、祇蘇同帮來一千三四百包、聞因內地糙價繼　飛漲、又以搬運被阻等情、致北粳糙價已至十叫元、而薄稻糙價若松泗等區、已至十三元半、滬市貨主、聞得此訊、大都叉在扳守、北粳高貨、全未出樣、而南粳及薄稻亦屬少數、市塲情形、因又混亂、雖經公會竭力、嚴限、及評價會從事登記、然市上盛傳暗盤、復有超越十六元者、但以此輩顧忌殊深、交易異常秘密、故無從調查證實、惟客尖除决貨續提二三角外、高貨悉充本尖出售、故雖在限價、實則暗升多多矣、此種情形、豈非市塲畸形狀態乎、杜埠尖仍開十五元、　元以洋糯充塞、猶守原盤、香港糯米開十九元半至十九元三角、</p>
<h3>產地裝運受阻　客秈行清又抬　高貨升一二角　中决升二三角</h3>
<p>客秈自得產地裝運被阻消息後、市氣逐見緊張、而進戶亦以盤面較低、劉於拼搭、故昨日去胃依然活潑、中决貨行情乃又被抬高二三角、高貨升一二角、高蕪秈乃與京秈隨至停止出樣、中檔已到十四元、砶米亦開十三元五六角、新到京蕪餘州等糙米允見活潑、價開十二元五角半至十二元三角十一元七八角不等、洋米仍開原盤、但貨主已不肯暢出、西貢定貨已有數起在電洽中、能吾成為事實、尙待後證、洋元米續有到下、售價未有出人、</p>

<h3>珍眉售盤績秀</h3>
<p>本埠洋莊茶市、自日前湖州新貨、首批開盤後、各廠均已先後開工趕製、惟因到貨尙稀、成交仍少、咋市僅富華公司購進公利高莊珍眉十一件、價開二百二十二元、又永興洋行成交吉祥草珍眉十四件、價開二百四十元、行情允為挺秀云、昨由溫州裝來茶葉二十二件</p>
<h3>五金　新鉛絲稍見軟化</h3>
<p>前市上流通貨最尠而售價步步高漲之新鉛絲市面、近日來因天津靑島諸帮去路稍减、而行情仍能站住不跌、昨日二十一號至二十五號統花色售五十元、二十五號單吊貨仍開七十元、比前無上落、惟巳不及一星期前之堅硬、本街方面、略有採辦標準賴以不跌、</p>
<h3>煤炭　甌江復航　溫炭到滬</h3>
<p>售價因之續跌木炭來源、向靠浙東及長江之九江、自中日軍興、長江封鎖、九江炭之來源斷絕、故全賴浙東、然亦祇永嘉一路、上月中、因日艦在浙東沿海肆虐、華方軍事當局、為鞏固防務起見、將甫江·椒江·甌江·等口、相　禁止船隻出入、故本市與浙東之航運、頓吿斷絕、木炭之來源、因之絕跡、近日浙東沿海、巳略見鬆她、故舟山·溫州。業已通航、木炭來源已見活躍、咋日巳有一批到滬、計二萬零六百八十四簍之鉅、聞今日又有一萬　進口、故市塲消息傳來、人心黑定、售盤乃有續洛之勢、日昨某行開出甲種木炭七百擔、價做每擔三元三角、較上週巳見遜巴、</p>

<h3>南北貨　金菜高貨居奇</h3>
<p>金菜目各海口决第封鎖後、各方去路、大受打擊、價乃頻跌、其中尤以中下檔為甚、惟以來源吿斷、未致暴跌、惟市面常處於呆滯之中、茲港地霉汎已過、且前高價貨都已斬脫、故近日續有動辦、數亦可觀、市呈回蘇之象、前開淦字菜二十六元半、現照此色同等之斗字菜、已開至二十八元、而客心甚堅、且存貨均已復晒、可以久擱、故頂莊貨允覺居奇、惟中下檔以福建廈汕溫台等處、均之去　許過於樂觀、後市有抬高殺低之象、</p>
<h3>黑木耳有到　開價步鬆</h3>
<p>黑木耳前因交通不便、外費極昂、故市勢雖軟、尙無過甚上落、邇來漢口以有某方直輪運來、到數漸湧、合價較廉、致隨市步鬆、兼之連日華北「偽票」暴跌、去化大受打擊、人心更虛、昨市僅開一百六十元、受手不多、</p>

<h3>由香港到菲律賓</h3>
<p>— 來德</p>
<p>菲律濱羣島，是美國的屬地，位於香港的東南，它的京都岷尼拉（Manika）就是我們常聽到的小呂宋，距離香港不過六百二十六海里，最快的海輪，在三十小時裏頭就可以到達，飛機不過六小時的行程而已。該地風景美麗，地域富庶，實在是旅行和經商極好的目的地。現在我把自香港動身到菲律濱應備的手續和行程，分別寫在下面：</p>
<p>手績因為菲島是美國的屬地，所以遊客或者是商人，可以不必向我國政府請求護照祇要請求第六節證明書（Section　Six　Certifificate）就行了。遊客請求此項證明書，手續很是便利，商人要比較困難些。因為請求這種證明書的人很多，所以請領人第一先要到當地的美國領事館護照科請求指定請求（Applicatiin）的時間，得到美國領館指定時閒後，就在指定的時問內再到領事館繳納：（一）請求書，書內要述明請求人的姓名，年歲，國籍，職務，赴菲的目的，和經濟狀况等等，（二）當地名人，商人或機關（頂好是銀行）的介紹書，內容要和請求書相同；（三）二寸半身照片六張；將上面三種繳上後，該科的職員要向請求人詳細詢問的，一面問，一面就記錄在第六節證明書上，所以回答務必符合。美領館審查認為合格後，就寫信給我國政府的當地外交部辦事處，交給請求人自己去遞送，外交部職員也作同樣的詢問，並記錄在我國所發的第六節證明書上，請求人再繳證畫費十元，二寸半身照片三張，經過該處調查後就可發給了。得到第六節證明書後再拿它交給美國領事館換取預定船位證，再將該證交給中國旅行社，他們就可以代你定赴菲的船位了，同時他們還給你一張定妥船位證。拿着定妥船位證，和簽證費美金二元五角，同時交給美國領事館，扌能够換回我國政府所發的第六節證明書和美國領事館的第六節證明書。以上種種手續，大的要費一個禮拜到十天的功夫。</p>
<p>路程至於乘輪船赴菲呢，三四等的客人，在上岸的時候，困難非常之多，甚至不能上岸，所以還是乘頭二等好。定艙位時要繳美領館的定船位證，和當地著名醫生或醫院所出的種痘證明書，其票價錢如下：</p>

<h3>上海航業之動態</h3>
<p>— 景</p>
<p>上海自一八三四年（淸道光二十三年），闢埠通商以還，迄今僅足百年有零，即形成我國與世界交通之唯一中樞，不獨為全國最大都市，抑亦為世界最大都市之一，握國內經濟文化之重心，稱遠東貿易之耍港：其繁榮滋長，發展迅速，固無論已，交通事業之邁進，允可驚人。自戰事發生以來，陸空交通，相繼停滯，航業一項，仍見暢通，惟與戰前逈異，今就最近航業動態，的略作概括之闡述；</p>

<h3>美術界義賣救難</h3>
<p>— 蘭燕</p>
<p>陳列各種藝術作品三千種</p>
<p>有國晝西畫彫塑攝影古玩</p>
<p>昨日上午開幕售去一千元</p>
<p>歡迎各界選購並實行競賣</p>
<p>在「族第一，國家第一」這一口號之下，展開熱烈的戲賣運動，運　是孤島的好現像。</p>
<p>上海新聞界各報副刋正舉行着文章義賣，這一運動，各報正熱烈地推行着，其次，上海戲劇界也將舉行　合公演的義賣，據說，他們希望能籌得兩萬塊錢。至於昨天上午十時，在大新四樓舉行，由上海工商業美術作家協會主辦的「上海市美術界義賣救難」，情况非常熱鬧。會塲中陳列的作品，作家們的心血之作很多，而且也很精彩·一進門口，那裏是蜚聲畫壇的，以粉筆畫畫美女顧廷康的各種美女寫生畫，其中有好多幅，不單色調很柔和美麗，同時在光彩上，似乎比一般市上月份牌的美女圖也高上幾倍。顧君作品，以前工商業美術展覽會裏，我們已經領略過，他的確是別具一格的。</p>
<p>在作品中，有一幅花木蘭的畫像，騎在馬上，側手射箭，臉蛋有點像陳雲裳。標價在所有繪畫中聞也算最高了，那是一千元。其决我們看見一向以好萊塢女郎風姿，出現漫畫界的張英超，他在這决出品中，竟改變了作風，　了好多幅西畫式的中國畫，看上去到也別緻得了。</p>
<p>都錦生的織錦，陳列的東西很多，如畫屏，坐墊，彩色傘，佛像織屏等等，在會塲中表現了另一種特色。</p>
<p>和都錦生相映成美的，那是「蓓開蒂」的臘染，作品有坐墊等專，圖畫及風格，十分古雅，歡喜古典派風味臘染坐墊的，可以去選購幾種。</p>
<p>再進去，便是各種國畫及西畫了。</p>
<p>這一部份，水彩畫以最近舉行過個展的冉熙作品佔了一部份，他的畫喜歡用灰顏色，遠看在一片烟霧中，現出詩樣的輪廓，我個人到是愛這種活潑的錢條及他的氣氛的。</p>
<p>國畫中間，好的作品很多，但値得特別提出來的，是一位年靑的畫家孟安蘭君，他畫了一幅打破國畫不畫現實題材的舊路，他的作品，是呌「秋林行軍」，畫的是一列中國武裝軍隊，和一尊大砲的行列，在原野森林中前進，這是多麼使人驚喜的作呵。</p>
<p>在古玩中，　廷康君不少磁碗及古石器的彫塑等，中閒有兩種如「小石刻漢畫屏」及「大唐木刻像，統統標價二千元。這見這古玩的珍貴了。</p>
<p>其决有盧斯福，郎靜山等的攝影等，都有很好的作品，顧廷康君在這裏又有兩幅畫値得提出的，一幅是「萌芽」，畫的兩個軍裝的兒童，對面舉着手，上面題着：「國力的泉源，民族的靈魂，十年後，踏着血的足跡，邁進！」還有一幅，題字是「難」，母親是瞎子，女兒扶着她走，這和孟君作品併合起來，是　是而三的具有抗戰意義的警惕的作品。</p>
<p>上午一開幕，就被定去了一千元作品，據會中人說：他們希望有人競賣，即你出二十元，如有人出四十元，那麼出得最多的得到作品。</p>
<p>作者作品，可分為兩種：一種除去會塲開支，完全義賣的；一種是開支以外，作者及義賣各半。會塲中完全義賣的作品，有顏文樑圖畫及盧斯福，郎靜山等皆全部獻作義賣。</p>
<p>會期有十天，而且作品時常更換，即使不買東西，也大可去看看：如使能慷慨解護，那自然為難胞們造福無窮了。（義賣獻金）</p>
<h3>「翠堤春曉」觀感</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“The　Great　Wnliz”</p>
<p>「翠堤春曉」是寫華爾滋的創始人約翰史屈勞斯的一生從他醉心音樂開始，及他和愛妻波蒂，女伶卡拉的一段如火荼的羅曼斯，而以奧國革命為挿曲。這正如「絕代豔后」一樣，寫曼麗安東妮的一生，而忽略了法國革命的因果，「翠堤春曉」的奧國革命也衹淡的一個影子而已。本片的導演是法人裘林杜凡維，他是歐洲著名的電影導演。演約翰晚屈勞斯的是被稱為希佛莱第二」的　　拉凡（好像他和卡洛郎白合演過「游龍戲　）。演波蒂的是露意絲　納。演卡拉的是波　歌后密麗莎高姬絲。還有一位俄籍音樂師担任了收集史屈勞斯的音樂。</p>
<p>對於這位第一决出現在我們面前的法國導演裘林杜凡維，他的卓越的手腕是値得我們推崇的。他在每一塲戲中，都能把情緒氣象緊緊地控制住；允其是「特寫」和「特寫」的跟鏡頭的運用，更增强感人的力量</p>
<p>如：（一）約翰史屈勞斯初銀行僻退之後，第一次演奏於杜爾美咖啡館的時候，鏡顛從音樂台上拉開，整個咖啡館中除了波蒂和她的父母，約翰的母親之外，沒有另行一個賓客。但是當卡拉和她的隨從官員進來後，約翰又奏起了第二個曲子，於是整個咖啡館騷然了。這裏導演者運用了傾巷來歸的各個特寫，樂隊的特寫，約翰的特寫，波　的特寫，人午歡狂的特寫，非常冗長的一場戱處理得那樣激動而活潑。（二）從狂歡的華爾滋舞化到賀漢福履德伯爵府邸的宴會，道塲戲中他又運用了約翰奏琴，卡拉　唱他的新曲的特寫，在每一個特寫中，襯出了即使被高貴的人們認為野蠻音樂的華蘭滋也激動了他們的興趣。（三）約翰和波蒂的結婚。在一間狹，小的屋子中，也因為運用特寫的得當而　得熱鬧無比。　特別可愛的，是約翰和卡拉避居在維也馬蹄聲中，一輛馬車在晨曦初吐的森林中前進，那羊羣，那烏鳴，車夫的小口琴獨奏，郵車上的號聲，在這樣幽靜的環境中的翰和波拉合作「翠堤春曉的新曲」這是本片中精彩的一塲戲，無論鏡頭的角度，音樂和昔響的配合，情緒氣象，都達於頂點，其他的例子，不勝枚舉，如的翰和卡拉在飯店中的那塲華爾滋舞：卡拉告訴約翰皇家劇院聘請的消息，當時三個人——的翰，波蒂，卡拉的不同的情緒分析；賀漢福履德的伯爵的勸說波蒂去破壤的翰和卡拉的愛戀；波蒂趕到戲院去會見的翰和卡拉；及最後的翰送走了卡拉在多瑙河上痴痴過了一夜，而創造出了永傳不朽的一藍色多瑙河」的曲子等等，每塲戲中，導演者都運用了多量的特寫來加强每塲戲的氣氛。</p>
<p>關於演員：茀那葛拉凡和密麗莎高姬絲都演得很好。前者在「遊龍戲鳳」後不知演過其他的戲沒有，如果就以這兩部作品來比較起來，眞是不可同日而語了。後者的高音似乎是勝過格雷絲摩亞和珍妮麥唐納的。露薏絲蕾納的波蒂。我想舉出兩塲戲來，以見她的優越的演技：在卡拉來報吿皇家劇院聘請的消息的時候，她能以停滯的眼珠來傳達出心中憂怨和憤怒；她到後台去的時候，在極沉痛的情緒下犧牲了自已，而又强作笑容和每個人道晚安，走出門後扌黯然地倚到盤梯的欄杆上。她的含淚的微笑眞是太感動人了。</p>
<p>總之，「翠堤春曉」在技術上的成功，是遠超出「樂府滄桑」的。</p>

<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第九回　含悲茹苦淚灑四廂崇儉習勞體勤十畝</p>
<p>這些農業上的器械，並不是怎樣複雜的，中國的機器廠，都能自已製造的。加着近年來，吾國的農業機械家，很能自出心裁，製造了不少種田機器。朱村長那時和別處幾個村的村長聯合了，設立了好多的農業機械站。怎麼呌做農業機械站呢？每一個站中，安放着不少的農業機器，如播種機啊，戽水機啊，翻泥機啊，種種的機器。倘然有那個村子裏，買不起機器，而又是需要用那種機器時，可以向這個站中去借用。也有的：是由那個村子裏置備了，作為公有的。也有的。。先借用了，以後慢慢的再由各家攤還。不過這不許私家置備了那種機器，以為　之具。像戰前有種人，備了一副　水的機器馬一達，裝在一隻小船上。搖到東村，給人家車水；搖到西村，給人家車水。反正水是到處有的。他要給人家車滿一畝田水，就得要多少餞。還有給人家　穀打米的，也是把機器一裝在船上，出來兜那種生　。朱村長可不是要獲取私人之利利，他是為各處的農村，謀取一公益的。但是到集體農塲組織成了，每一個集體農塲，都能自辦機器。還有的，力量要超出乎農業機械化之上的，　如一地方的水利，或是農業電氣化，關於有很大的工程的。這不是一個集體農塲所能為力，他們就集合了幾個集體農塲的力量來舉辦。這個力量就非常之厚，再有什麼不能辦到呢？因為用了機械，便可以减少人工，省下來的勞力，便可以辦別樣事。而省下來的時間，還可以求知識，求學問。現在朱村長所辦的自由村小學校，仍舊和他十幾年前，做鄉下先生一般，還是不放暑假寒假，在農忙的時節放學，依然稱之為放一農忙假一·這個風氣，連別村也有學樣的。不但別付，連別省的農村，也有學樣的。這個農忙假，已流行於全中國的農村了，而風氣倒是那位獨臂校長朱老源開的。此外，他因為許多鄕下人，失學的很多。有的本來就失學的，有的是為了戰時而失學的，因比他就投立了很多的袖習學校。無論是男是女，他以為能够袖習一點兒，總歸為公為私，都是有益的。正是</p>

<h3>上海的猪肉市場</h3>
<p>— 雁</p>
<p>猪肉，是我們中國人主要食料之一，所以上海的肉店，是遍及着全市的任何一個菜塲，和任何一條街衢。這裏，筆者就把猪肉市塲的現狀，記誌如下：</p>
<p>猪的來源上海鮮猪的來源，最大多數係來自江北的天生靑龍兩港，决之係來自溫台州，再次是浦東和蘇錫區域，但這在「八一三」以前的惰形是如此；滬戰以後，因着滬浙交通若斷若續，貨運困難，這一路的來源便告斷絕；而浦東和蘇錫地帶，則因時有游擊戰爭，民衆生活不安，副業生產减少，故滬上到貨已寥寥無幾。因此，目前上海猪的來源，事實上已只限於江北方面了。</p>
<p>銷食數額在戰前的食肉狂盛時期，上海每日猪肉的銷食數量，大概自五千至八九千頭左右：清淡時期（即大伏季和重陽季等），每日僅有四五百頭：長年相扯，每日為二千三百頭。滬戰以後，因着鮮豬來源减少，需要量却增大，故價格一再遞漲；不過，肉價既然高漲，當然除了一部的有錢市民，和婚喪宴會必需以外，最大部份的小市民階級，是不會再把猪肉常做家常的菜餚了。所以，戰後上海鮮猪到貨，每天雖僅有二三千頭，但因多數市民無力食肉，在這所謂「在盛時期」倒也並不見發生恐慌要是除了這幾天的特殊情形以外。</p>
<p>鮮猪絕跡自從猪隻被「統制」以來，　起全市鮮肉業的堅決反對，以致鮮猪的來源都被壟斷和剝　奪；這樣，市上的鮮猪便絕跡了。據調查：這幾天市上最少數的鮮肉，係由浦東方面運來，每天到貨僅二十餘頭至四十頭，試問怎樣够產市主顧的需求呢？不過，全市鮮豬和全體的屠去們，他們對這殊勢力的　迫，決定堅持反對，堅持不合作主義到底。他們——每一個經營鮮肉莊和猪行的人們都感覺到：他們被剝削得太利害了，太痛苦了，每頭猪由南通經天生港運到上海，某方在過去本要徵收岸上水上的種種苛捐達九元五角之鉅，現在在上海進口時，某方又要加徵每頭三元的統稅，並且控制全市鮮肉市塲的營業樞紐；因此，他們如果忍受下來，則不僅某方會得寸進尺，步步進逼，而且他們的生命錢，將完奎被扼住了！也因此，他們寗願暫停營業，這受奇大的損失，而奮鬭到底！</p>

<p>上海的舞塲，眞是愈設愈多了，而且很少門庭冷落的，難道說這些逃難而來的難民，還有閑情逸致麼？難道說國事如此，還有心腸尋歡作樂麼？時常會想起了這問題來問朋友，朋友却反問我道，你不是常熟逃難來此的嗎？你不是自命有志之士嗎？敎我拿什麽話來回答，就是自己捫心自問，也不知道什麽緣故，總而言之，無可排愁，聊以解悶而已。</p>

<p>大華也去過兩次，龍裝已取銷了，臨街開窗，尚稍涼爽，　得仍　甚變更，表演已取銷，賣座尚算不壞。夜舞到過好莱　隔壁的夜總會，地點很幽靜，音樂　衹三人隧，却非常清　動聽，　說要午夜方上座，我們去的時候，約在九十點鐘，大有獨佔舞坐一桌，皆係外籍，據侍者言，須喚其坐檯，方可伴舞，但坐檯並不須舞票，祇給酒賬而巳。</p>

<p>軍閥慘殺優伶的殘暴行為</p>
<p>所以老褚到了那裏　撲了個空兒，不過事情已被他知曉，似他那種毛包性子，還管什麼眞不眞呢；登時發個命令，派出一排人，跑到高劉出演的劇院裏前去捕人，可憐漢臣三魁兩人，都還正在台上演戲，這一般如狼似虎的軍士們，奔到台上，就把他們綑綁了去，高劉兩家，忙做一團，一面急急托人營救，一面電知梅大王，請他代懇魯張解救，誰知老褚未等張氏電到，早已加了個赤化的罪名，把兩人給槍斃了，自己的太太起意，勾引人家上了圈套，不但令罪魁禍首，逍遙法外，反倒把被動的人無故慘殺，這種事惟有以前的軍閥們扌能做得出來，未幾直魯失敗，褚氏被劉珍年活活的埋入土堆裹，這也是他殘忍好殺的報應呢。</p>
<p>老褚本來就不大贊成伶人，這事說來也很可笑，原來他因為自己是綠林出身，而中國的戲劇裹總好把綠林人扮的不像個人樣，所勾的臉譜，也都同妖怪相似，並且凡是强盜的頭領，結果總是被人殺掉，所以他最不愛看的就是「八大拿」這一類戲，自從他槍斃了劉高二人之後，更是對於伶人深惡痛絕，有時在張長腿跟前遇到了這般人，他總是不理不睬，倘若有人想討好於他，同他攀談幾句，他頓時扳起面孔說道：「這裏就顯着你們些唱戲的」。弄得後來大家都不敢同他講話，由此可見他雖是出身與長腿一樣，然而兩人的性情可大不相同，一則大捧伶人，一則慘殺優伶，這更是大相逕庭的了。（一〇）</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army on All Fronts Is Currently Unable to Advance; The Battle Situation in Jiangxi Is Under Chinese Control; Japanese Attempts to Invade Xiangyang Along the Hanshui River are Met with Strong Defense by Chinese Troops; Yichang Is Fully Prepared Militarily, the Chinese Side Is Determined to Defend It; Major Battle Erupts in the Sui County-Zaoyang Area, Making it Difficult for the Japanese to Advance Westward</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yu telegram, the Japanese army on all fronts is now in a difficult situation, the Chinese army is constantly dividing and attacking the Japanese army with an active posture, and the entire battle situation in Jiangxi is under Chinese control. The Japanese army near Nanchang has repeatedly concentrated small units to counterattack in an attempt to lift the threat, but all have been repelled by the Chinese side. The Chinese army in Henan has strengthened its lineup, and the Japanese army in northeastern Henan was attacked by the Chinese army during troop movements and changes of guard. (Special dispatch on the 12th) In Fengcheng, the Japanese air force has been assisting in the battle on the front lines of northern Jiangxi for several days, but its bombing is often inaccurate, and many bombs mistakenly fall within the Japanese positions. According to reconnaissance reports, three incidents have been discovered. The first incident was on May 4, when dozens of bombs were mistakenly dropped near Fotoucheng in the southeastern suburbs of Nanchang. The second incident was on the 6th, near Dacheng. The third incident was on the 10th, in Xihucun, west of Gao'an. (Telegram on the 11th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A Reuters reporter asked a high-ranking Chinese military officer about the Xiangyang battle situation today. According to the officer, the situation in northern Hubei is tense because a Japanese force is advancing north towards Xiangyang from the south. However, reports of "major Japanese victories" or "150,000 Chinese troops being trapped" are simply untrue. The Chinese army is currently resisting the Japanese westward advance in the vicinity of Sui County. The Chinese front east of Xiangyang is intact. The only noteworthy point is that a Japanese force of fewer than 10,000 men has broken into Xiangyang from the south. According to recent intelligence, this Japanese force has appeared in the southeast of Xiangyang. Whether this risky move by the Japanese is a clever maneuver or a suicidal act remains to be seen. After receiving news of the Japanese advance north, the Chinese commander immediately ordered the Chinese army east of Xiangyang to be on high alert, to prevent the Japanese from advancing from the east and west, while the Chinese army south of Xiangyang would cross the Hanshui River and attack the rear of the Japanese force. The Chinese army is now planning to encircle this Japanese force that has penetrated deep into the rear of the Chinese lines. The fate of Xiangyang will likely be decided within the next few days, at which point it will be known whether the Chinese army will be able to annihilate the Japanese force behind its lines, or will be forced to retreat to points west of the Hanshui River. (Reuters telegram on the 12th) Judging from the situation, if the Japanese attempt to invade Yichang, the Chinese army will resolutely defend the city. The Chinese here believe that the Japanese may wait for the Yangtze River to rise, making it possible to use their gunboats, before taking rash action. The navigation markers between Yichang and Shashi have recently been removed, and it is expected that water barriers will soon be set up between the two ports. Neutral observers also say that extensive military preparations are being made east of Yichang, with strong field artillery units and mechanized units with tanks moving forward in a steady stream. A Chinese businessman told a Reuters reporter that if the Japanese attempt to invade Yichang, it will not be easy to win, and what they will get will be an empty city or a scorched earth. Yichang is like other towns easily reached by Japanese bombers. Shortly after dawn, residents leave the city and return only in the evening. Restaurants, shops, and most businesses start operating at that time. The authorities have accomplished great feats in Yichang. Before the fall of Hankou, a large number of machines and various goods were transported upstream to this port. In the early winter of last year, large quantities of metal machines and items needed by China were piled up in the suburbs of Yichang. If they had been occupied by the Japanese, they would have been most useful to the Japanese. However, with the exception of a large quantity of cotton and other flammable materials destroyed by air raids, all of these items have now been safely transported upstream along the river. (Reuters telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A military observer told an Associated Press reporter today that, judging from recent military news, the Japanese strategy is to take advantage of the Chinese army stationed on the left bank of the Hanshui River being unprepared, to advance rapidly along the Hanshui River towards Xiangyang, forcing the left flank of the Chinese army stationed in northern Hubei to retreat towards Henan, thereby eliminating the threat felt by the Japanese right flank. Only in this way can the large Chinese forces east of Xiangyang and even in Xinyang, Henan, be unable to move. At the same time, the Japanese can be said to have fully controlled the area east of the Hanshui River. After this, the Japanese may cross the Hanshui River again to take Shashi and Yichang. However, according to the observer, the Japanese have repeatedly attempted to cross the river in the past, but all have been repelled by the Chinese side and ended in failure. Therefore, whether they can succeed in crossing the river in the future is still a question. It is also said that if the Japanese cross the Hanshui River, it should be in the Jingmen area, but unless the Japanese transfer a large army from the south bank of the Yangtze River to reinforce the area, it will be difficult to achieve their goal. According to foreign observers, if the Japanese can seize Xiangyang, it can eliminate the threat to the Japanese flank, because the Chinese army in Henan has repeatedly launched large-scale counterattacks from the flank when the Japanese attempted to cross the river. At the same time, after the Japanese seize Xiangyang, they can further advance to Laohekou to attack Nanyang in Henan, attacking the rear of the Chinese army on the Pinghan Railway, in order to echo the Japanese army on the Yellow River. According to Chinese military news, the fighting between the Chinese and Japanese armies is extremely fierce in Tongbai in southwestern Henan. The Japanese army, under the cover of aircraft and artillery, is fiercely attacking Tongbai from Wujiadian, east of Tongbai. The Chinese army there is fighting bravely, and the Japanese offensive has begun to stall. At the same time, a major battle has also erupted in the Sui County-Zaoyang area. The Japanese advancing on Zaoyang are cavalry, and clear artillery fire can be heard in Zaoyang city. As for the towns and cities in the Nanyang area, they have been subjected to indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft, and countless lives and houses have been damaged and destroyed. (Associated Press telegram on the 11th) The Japanese army in Tianmen Yuekou is very panicked because a certain Chinese unit is advancing towards Wamiaoji. They are now transporting heavy goods to the rear. The Japanese army in Tianmen has moved outside the city, and the Bailuoji Japanese airfield has been shut down, and the equipment for building the airfield has been transported by steamboats along the Han River. Several hundred members of a certain Chinese unit's dare-to-die corps crossed the river near the Tuochuan wharf in Yonglong on the 10th and attacked the Japanese army in Yanmenkou Wamiaoji.

<p>(Chongqing) At 7:00 tonight, 21 Japanese aircraft suddenly attacked Chongqing, and the north bank of the Jialing River across from Chongqing was clearly given special attention by the Japanese aircraft. Many bombs were dropped, causing several fires. When the alarm first sounded at 6:30, Chinese aircraft immediately took off and repeatedly attacked the Japanese aircraft that came in formation. The air combat today was undoubtedly fierce. Chinese fighter planes tumbled up and down, fighting fiercely. After the Japanese aircraft entered the urban area, Chinese anti-aircraft artillery immediately opened fire, and the artillery fire was very fierce. The Japanese aircraft bombed the north bank for two minutes, and the explosive force was extremely strong. Even the deep underground shelters were shaken, like an earthquake. Those taking refuge in the shelters had their eardrums ache from the shock. The all-clear was given one hour later, and it has now been confirmed that three Japanese aircraft were shot down. (Reuters telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The wreckage of the three Japanese bombers shot down by Chinese fighter planes in the Chongqing air battle on May 3 has now been found, and today hundreds of Chinese soldiers transported it into the city. Crowds lined the streets to watch it pass. It is said that the wreckage of the Japanese aircraft will be publicly displayed for several days. (Reuters telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) This morning, the front page of the Chongqing United Daily News printed the following slogans in large characters: (1) All the people of Chongqing express sympathy for the bombing of foreign consulates. (2) All the people of Chongqing express gratitude for the sympathy of foreigners for those in the city who were bombed. (3) We will demand the repayment of the blood debt of May with fresh blood; we will further strengthen our determination to win.

<p>(Chongqing) At around 7:00 on the evening of the 12th, Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing City wildly again. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Twenty-seven Japanese aircraft entered the airspace of this city from northern Sichuan at 7:00 PM on the 12th and engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese air force. After being fired upon by the Chinese anti-aircraft units, the Japanese aircraft dropped dozens of bombs on civilian residential areas in the suburbs and fled. The Chinese side gave the all-clear at 7:53 PM. Casualties and losses have not yet been determined. When the Japanese aircraft dropped bombs, three were shot down by the Chinese anti-aircraft artillery units, and they are now searching for the wreckage in different directions. (Telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) This area, which was devastated after being bombed by Japanese aircraft for several days since last Tuesday, is now showing signs of recovery. This evening, more than 20 Japanese aircraft attacked again, causing several fires. Chinese anti-aircraft artillery displayed its power and shot down two Japanese aircraft. The alarm was issued in the evening, and thirty minutes later, Japanese aircraft were spotted in the sky. When the Japanese bombers flew over the north bank of the Jialing River, they dropped dozens of incendiary bombs, causing fires to break out everywhere. The Chinese anti-aircraft artillery then concentrated its fire and fired intensely. The Japanese aircraft then flew to the south bank of the Yangtze River and dropped several bombs, causing fires to break out in two places. According to investigations, the city was not affected, presumably due to the intensive firing of anti-aircraft artillery. After the Japanese aircraft dropped bombs, they immediately left. There are conflicting reports on the number of Japanese aircraft shot down. According to the Associated Press, two Japanese aircraft were shot down, while the Chinese report said three. There are no official statistics on the number of casualties in today's air raid, but it is said to be very small, because most of the bombs dropped by the Japanese were incendiary bombs. Although many people were injured, they were only skin wounds and not serious. At the same time, because the alarm was issued early, residents were able to calmly take refuge in air raid shelters. Today, the Chinese anti-aircraft gunners were exceptionally effective, and the searchlights illuminated the sky, searching for Japanese aircraft, so the Japanese aircraft did not dare to stay for long.

<p>The British Protested the Japanese Bombing of Chongqing</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie protested to Foreign Minister Arita this morning about the Japanese aircraft bombing Chongqing in a way that endangered the lives of British embassy and consulate staff, and strongly stated that the Japanese air raids were generally inhumane.

<h3>Last Minute News</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) A spokesman for the Military Affairs Commission said that recently, Japanese broadcasts have repeatedly stated that a certain unit of theirs has surrounded more than 20 divisions of the Chinese army in the area east of a certain place and is staging a second annihilation campaign, causing general concern among friendly countries sympathetic to China's resistance. In fact, this kind of malicious propaganda is a common trick of the Japanese and does not require refutation or explanation. Regarding the military plans of Japan and us, the focus is different, and it cannot be determined which side is in an advantageous position until the final victory or defeat is clear. Military actions during combat or while planning a certain battle are military secrets and cannot be arbitrarily disclosed. However, there are two points that can comfort friendly countries. First, the area they claim to have surrounded our army is a continuous mountainous area, more than 100 kilometers from east to west and more than 170 kilometers from north to south, with high mountains, steep ridges, deep valleys, and secluded forests. What the current situation is is another matter. Even according to the Japanese propaganda, the surrounded troops are so large, the area of the mountainous area is so vast, and the terrain is so dangerous, may I ask what number of troops they will need to complete the encirclement? How will the tens of thousands of people currently there achieve their encirclement goal? Anyone with a little military common sense can know this. Their intention is really to deceive foreign people who do not understand the terrain of China, which is very childish and ridiculous. Second, the encirclement operation they claim is extremely weak. Its right wing has only more than 2,000 people. After being severely attacked by our XX unit, more than 1,000 were killed, and the remaining can only barely maintain XX and other places and cannot advance. The XX Division, which attacked from the front, was also eliminated by our XX unit. The Gongjing Regiment, which boasted of being a strong right wing, is now being severely attacked by a certain unit of ours, and the chief of staff of a certain division on its flank has also been killed. The so-called encirclement battle is actually only the reality of this. There have been many examples of battles in the war where overly adventurous actions have ultimately led to failure. Perhaps the Japanese army will repeat the mistakes of history, but it is not yet known. (Telegram on the 12th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Effectiveness of Bombing</h3>
<p>From a general strategic point of view, in addition to the direct military effectiveness of air force bombing of the enemy, such as destroying strongholds and cutting off reinforcements, it is not unprecedented to select certain cities as targets. Its only reason is to destroy the enemy's resources in order to control the enemy and seek victory for oneself. Therefore, the selected cities must be the key areas to which the enemy's industrial, commercial, and mining lifeline is tied. China is an agricultural country, and its resources are accumulated in the vast fields, and are absolutely not in one city. Therefore, the Japanese air force bombing of Chinese cities violates general strategic principles; at least, it cannot be argued on the basis of general strategic reasons. But the facts are not so. In recent days, after the Japanese air force bombed the urban area of Chongqing, it continued to indiscriminately bomb undefended areas such as Shantou, Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Ningbo, and Moganshan, poisoning living beings. Observing the Japanese side's purpose, it is nothing more than using bombs as tools to threaten the Chinese people, discourage Chinese morale, and shake the people's belief in the inevitable victory of the war of resistance, so that the foundation of the war of resistance will be divided and its strength will be weakened, in order to complete its ambition to conquer China.</p>
<p>We are deeply convinced of the accuracy of this observation, and at the same time we know the ineffectiveness of this strategy. Not only is it ineffective, but it also reaps the opposite of what is expected. US Ambassador to China Johnson recently told reporters in San Francisco, "The Japanese aircraft's wanton bombing of Chinese civilian residential centers only makes the Chinese people's hatred of Japan even higher." This is a penetrating remark. And the fact that important American officials can be so clear and thorough about the Chinese national character is an important factor in the harmony of Sino-American relations! The Chinese people's shared hatred of the enemy has been forged by the War of Resistance; the Japanese bombs' rumbling bombing, however, is no different from helping to forge it, and has added countless hammers!</p>
<p>Observing the war situation calmly, the Chinese army has adopted the "war of attrition" strategy from the beginning, and recently it has used the "mobile warfare" strategy to make the Japanese army "run around" and has taken the initiative on various battlefields, gaining initial victories. This proves that the Chinese army's combat ability is infinite and gradually increasing. On the other hand, the Japanese army has further exposed the weakness of its strength and the difficulty of military progress. The unfolding of this new situation has naturally made Japan feel panicked. Because its ambition has not been fulfilled, it is struggling desperately; it is making every effort to use political power to fully implement the General Mobilization Law as a last resort; externally, it is using its relatively superior air force to wantonly bomb various parts of China as a source of propaganda for war achievements, in order to replace the news of victory.</p>
<p>In the recent bombings, the interests of the great powers in China have also suffered great losses, and even consulates and embassies have become targets of bombing. Although Japanese Navy Rear Admiral Kanazawa issued a statement after the bombing of Chongqing, stating that the Japanese air force only targeted Chinese military facilities, but the impact of shrapnel could not be avoided. However, a huge crater with a circumference of twenty-four feet was bombed in the garden of the British Consulate in Chongqing. How can this be said to be the result of shrapnel impact? Not only that, but the Japanese army's mouthpiece, the Kokumin Shimbun, even published remarks threatening the personal safety of Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China; and the American church property on Moganshan, which has no military facilities, was also bombed. Here, we cannot help but recall that at the beginning of the War of Resistance, British Ambassador to China Sir Hughe Knatchbull-Hugessen was strafed by Japanese aircraft on the Shanghai-Nanjing Road; and American warships anchored in the Yangtze River were bombed by Japanese aircraft. Afterwards, Japan provided assurances to the United Kingdom and the United States that the same incidents would not happen again. But the recent bombing of Chongqing and Moganshan has blown up its own guaranteed credibility. China's War of Resistance is the vanguard of all democratic countries in the world. All countries that sympathize with China will never ignore this Japanese atrocity. Where interests are concerned and justice lies, they will eventually bring out more concrete forces to sanction this atrocity and promote sanctions. This is another harvest of bombing!</p>
<h3>Using Terrorist Incidents as an Excuse to Encourage Landing by Japanese Troops; Blaming Gulangyu Authorities for Lacking Sincerity; Warning Citizens Not to Flee; An American Warship Has Already Sailed</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Because the chairman of the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce, Hong Lixun, was seriously injured in an assassination in Gulangyu, the Japanese Marine Corps landed in Gulangyu this morning, using it as an excuse. The Japanese naval commander in Xiamen issued a statement on the matter, expressing concern about this "terrorist act." It is reported that the Japanese consulate had notified the Gulangyu authorities in advance that the Japanese Marine Corps intended to land in Gulangyu for a "inspection tour." The Japanese side believed that the Gulangyu authorities had not taken effective steps to prevent the incident from occurring, and their attitude was "insincere." The Japanese side also warned the citizens to "live and work in peace" and not to flee, so as not to be mistaken for dangerous elements. There are currently seven American citizens and 23 Filipino citizens in Gulangyu. It is expected that the American warship USS Bulmer will arrive in Gulangyu tomorrow for a routine visit (Associated Press telegram on the 12th). Gulangyu: After a pro-Japanese person was assassinated yesterday, about 200 Japanese sailors have landed in the international settlement here. According to a statement issued by the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps in Xiamen, when the commander-in-chief of the Japanese fleet and his staff officers were inspecting Gulangyu, this unexpected incident occurred. Therefore, a part of the sailors immediately landed to protect the Japanese commander-in-chief and to search for the criminals of this terrorist act. It is said that Gulangyu is an island between Xiamen and the mainland, and its international settlement enjoys roughly the same status as the Shanghai International Settlement. There are no foreign troops stationed here, but there is usually at least one foreign warship anchored in the port to protect the interests of foreigners. Hong Lixun, the chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Xiamen under Japanese rule, who was attacked yesterday, was reportedly shot with a pistol, injuring his left lung. According to Japanese sources, his injuries are quite critical. The statement from the commander of the Japanese Marine Corps in Xiamen stated that Hong was attacked when the commander-in-chief of the Japanese fleet was touring Gulangyu. It also said that although the Japanese side had repeatedly requested the international settlement authorities to control the terrorists who sneaked into Gulangyu from the mainland, this terrorist act still occurred, which is regrettable. This is because the visit of the Japanese commander-in-chief to Gulangyu had already been notified to the international settlement authorities by the Japanese consul general. After the Japanese sailors landed here, their commander issued a notice, stating that the Japanese action was only to suppress anti-Japanese terrorists, and hoped that the residents of the international settlement would not be misled by baseless rumors and would continue to do business as usual. He also warned residents that if they attempted to flee Gulangyu, they would be in danger of being mistaken for anti-Japanese elements. (Reuters telegram on the 12th). Gulangyu: The Japanese side conducted a major search this morning, and there have been arrests. The entrances and exits of Gulangyu are now guarded by Japanese soldiers, attempting to prevent Chinese people from fleeing into the hinterland under Chinese control. The British destroyer HMS Dicot (1,375 tons) is currently docked in the port, but there are no American warships stationed here. (Reuters telegram on the 12th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese Marine Corps landed in Gulangyu, using the sniping incident as an excuse, and the situation on the island is quite serious. The island is similar to the Shanghai International Settlement, located between Siming Island and the Fujian mainland, with an area of ​​four and a half square miles and a population of 5,000, including 400 foreigners. Half of the residents are refugees who have fled from various places. Among the foreigners, there are seven American citizens and 23 Filipino citizens. The American warship USS Parrott is scheduled to sail to the island tomorrow. (Special dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Bombs Used to Bomb Chinese Civilians are Mainly from China's Allies; National Diplomacy Association Cables the US, Calling for Stimson's Attention</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Japanese warlords are carrying out unprecedentedly barbaric bombings in various parts of China, and their weapons mainly come from China's ally, the United States. The National Diplomacy Association of China recently cabled Mr. Stimson, chairman of the American Committee Against Japanese Aggression, expressing China's determination to resist and deeply hoping that the United States would strengthen its efforts to boycott the actions of aggressor countries. The original telegram translated as follows: Japan is carrying out unprecedentedly barbaric bombings of Chinese cities and residents, and its weapons mainly come from China's ally, the United States. This kind of cowardly murder is only enough to strengthen China's determination to resist, and at the same time, it is deeply believed that this will also make our friends strengthen their efforts to boycott the aggressors.

<h3>Japanese Troops Withdraw from Xinhui; Chinese Troops Pursue Victory; Leizhou Peninsula Highways Destroyed; Chinese Troops Gather Downstream of the West River</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) A Zhongshan telegram reports that Chinese troops under Deng Longguang, Gu Dinghua, and others launched a counter-offensive towards Jiangmen Huicheng on the morning of the 11th amidst rain. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and completely withdrew from Huicheng in the afternoon. Chinese troops are in pursuit, and Chinese troops on the Xinhe and Jiangfo routes are also pressing towards Jiangmen. Wu Fei, secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Committee, arrived in Shiqi, Zhongshan, on the afternoon of the 12th, and immediately assumed command of the guerrilla column, unifying command of the entire Zhongshan county. Chinese troops in the Leizhou Peninsula have thoroughly destroyed the highways, deployed a large army, and are strictly guarding against Japanese invasion. A large Chinese army is gathering downstream of the West River, and the Japanese army has also been making frequent movements recently, indicating a major battle is brewing. (12th Dispatch) Confirmed news: Chinese troops fiercely attacked Jiangmen Xinhui on the morning of the 11th amidst rain, and recaptured Huicheng in the afternoon. The Japanese army suffered extremely heavy casualties. (12th Dispatch) Zhaoqing: At approximately 9:00 AM on the 12th, a Japanese plane flew over this area and scattered absurd leaflets. Subsequently, seven Japanese planes arrived to reconnoiter, then flew to the opposite bank and carried out fierce bombing. Many civilian houses and boats along the river were destroyed. (12th Dispatch) Guilin: The Japanese army from the Zengcheng and Conghua areas transported an observation balloon. Chinese raiding troops attacked Fuhe on the morning of the 8th, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers, burning the Japanese barracks, and capturing the puppet maintenance association head, Chen Guiquan. (12th Dispatch) Qingyuan: In the past week, the naval battles in Guangdong have become quiet. The Japanese have decided to adopt an offensive posture on the southwestern route, concentrating their forces to attack Jiangmen and Xinhui on the right flank of the Chinese western front, attempting to sweep through Zhaoqing and Nanyang and seize the southern route. The Chinese military authorities, aware of the Japanese plan, have not only strictly ordered the defending troops in that area to fiercely resist but have also ordered troops from the southeast to launch an attack at the opportune moment. Chinese troops in the Sanshui area recaptured Makou, Old Sanshui, and other places, and advanced directly to the outskirts of Sanshui city. The Japanese were forced to recall the Japanese troops attacking Jiangmen, and retreated to defend the original positions under Japanese surveillance in Xialegang. On the left flank of the western front, after Chinese troops on the Lubao-Southwest highway line captured Yangmei and Baorutang, the Japanese army repeatedly counterattacked, but ultimately failed. Chinese troops on the Foshan-Tanbu highway captured Guanyao and Fengyong and advanced to Songgangxu, posing a serious threat to the Japanese troops on the Guangzhou-Sanshui route. The Japanese troops who had set out from Foshan to Jiangmen were forced to return to fight. The Chinese troops then moved from Guanyao to Tanbu Sanjiang to hold firm. Subsequently, the Japanese army increased its forces by more than a thousand infantry and artillery soldiers to attack. The Chinese troops defended their positions and resisted, and the Japanese army ultimately failed. Tanbu Sanjiang is the connecting point between the northwest routes of the Chinese army. The Japanese army attempted to cut off this line, not only to deal with the guerrillas in the Nanhai-Sanshui-Huaxian border area of the Chinese army, and relieve the threat to the left flank of the Japanese army on the southern section of the Yuehan Railway in Guogang, but also to advance and seize Lubao Qingyuan, approaching Yingde. On the right flank of the western front, on the Gaoyao-Gaoyi highway, the Japanese sent motorboats and rubber boats to attack Sanzhou. Due to the fierce resistance of the Chinese army, they were also unable to land. The Japanese army on the Jiangmen-Foshan highway, on the Pilu section, invaded Gu Bu Xiechu and Shaxu to the west. The Chinese army gathered its troops and fought with the Japanese army five times. The Japanese were all defeated and routed eastward. The Chinese troops on the front of the Ningyang Railway were able to calmly resist the Japanese and launched a protracted war in the Xinhui area for more than ten days. The Japanese were ultimately unable to cross the Chinese Quanze. Later, the Japanese detoured to attack Huadan Shuikou, attempting to outflank the Chinese. The Chinese army launched a head-on fierce attack for a day and night, and that place was immediately recaptured. A large Chinese army also arrived at the front line in a timely manner, and the Siyi area was turned from danger to safety. At this point, the Japanese army's plan to invade the southwestern route was completely shattered by the Chinese. (11th Dispatch) Macau: The Chinese troops in the Zhongshan area, due to the concentration of Japanese warships and troop transport ships at various points along the coast, expect that they will attack Zhongshan in the next few days, so they are currently deploying everything to prepare for resistance. The Japanese are scheduled to hold a military conference in Guangzhou today. It is generally believed that after this conference is held, the Japanese army may begin to invade.

Zhao was originally stationed at a observation post. In the afternoon of the 21st, more than twenty Japanese soldiers were crawling south from the high ground west of Guyi. Zhao immediately sneaked around to the rear of the Japanese army, utilizing the terrain to conceal himself, and suddenly threw grenades to bombard them. The Japanese army was caught off guard and six were killed. After dusk, a fierce battle broke out. The Japanese army advanced westward under the cover of intense artillery fire. Zhao carried five grenades and bravely charged into the Japanese army's formation. More than twenty Japanese soldiers surrounded Zhao. The soldier calmly responded, unhurriedly unloading the grenades, and with three loud explosions, fifteen Japanese soldiers were lying in pools of blood. As the Japanese army, thinking that Chinese troops had entered their position, panicked and retreated eastward, Zhao's left arm was injured, and he fell into a mountain ditch. On the morning of the 22nd, he returned to his unit with pain, still regretting that he had not annihilated all of the surrounding Japanese soldiers. After receiving the report, a certain commander praised the soldier for his loyalty, bravery, and determination to sacrifice himself, deeming him worthy of being a role model for the entire army. In addition to giving him encouragement, he was also ordered to be sent to the Genius Military Officer Training Class for further training. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Chamberlain Warns: Do Not Misunderstand the Resolve of Britain and France; The Status of Danzig Will Not Be Altered by Force; However, Efforts Should Be Made to Restore International Trust</h3>
<p>(London) This afternoon, Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech to 8,000 female members of the Conservative Party at Albert Hall, earnestly stating that it is now imperative to make people feel that Britain and France both have the zeal to fulfill their vows to guarantee their allied countries. He first mentioned that he had the opportunity yesterday to exchange a few words with former French Prime Minister and Socialist leader Blum. Blum said that he and his Socialist friends all believe that the only danger of war in Europe lies in the general impression that Britain and France both lack the zeal and cannot be trusted to carry out their vows. Chamberlain replied that if that were the case, then there could be no more tragic misunderstanding. Would it not be appalling if Europe fell into war because of such a misunderstanding? The Prime Minister then mentioned the Danzig problem, earnestly stating that altering the status of that place by force and endangering the independence of Poland would inevitably cause a single spark to ignite a prairie fire, and Britain would be drawn into it. The Prime Minister said: "Many people believe that the danger point in Europe today lies in Danzig, and we feel that the guarantee we have given to Poland regarding that place is very clear. We would certainly be pleased to see the dispute between Germany and Poland resolved peacefully through discussion. Although we believe that the dispute can and should be resolved in this way, if Germany attempts to alter the current situation in Danzig by force and endanger the independence of Poland, it will inevitably cause a single spark to ignite a prairie fire, and Britain will also be drawn into it."</p>
<h3>Britain is Still Willing to Negotiate with Germany; However, Hitler Must Prove His Sincerity</h3>
<p>Nations Cannot Stand By and Watch Prime Minister Chamberlain went on to speak of the general international situation, saying that the British people have confidence in the strength of their country, and they have a clear conscience that their government has done and is doing everything possible to maintain peace. Therefore, they are calmly and resolutely determined. Britain is ready to listen to the opinions of other countries, as always, but it will not yield to dictatorship. Britain has never had the desire to isolate Germany or encircle Germany, nor has it obstructed Germany's natural and legitimate expansion of trade. Britain does not want to compete with Germany in armaments and economics without limits. We certainly do not want to refuse to discuss with Germany ways to increase mutual trade or improve economic conditions, but only after Germany gives us a genuine proof that it has the willingness to restore the trust that has been severely shaken. It is also very clear that we cannot stand by and watch the independence of other countries being destroyed one by one. The reason why we guarantee Poland, Romania, and Greece is because there will never be peace and security in Europe until all countries believe that no one dares to attempt to destroy independence. Our negotiations with the Soviet Union and Turkey are also for the sake of stabilizing the overall situation. While these discussions are underway, all I can say now is that I sincerely hope that these discussions will be completed soon, so that peace can be further consolidated. The Prime Minister then mentioned the heavy burden of armaments of various countries in the world, saying that now all that is needed is for the world and all countries to have a little rest from international tensions, and then there will be a guarantee of great progress in trade and prosperity, which will benefit everyone in the world. The Prime Minister then mentioned the conscription issue, requesting several European countries to feel doubtful about the seriousness of Britain's will. We believe that this kind of emotion is too strong and certainly hinders the success of the policy of trying to establish a peace front. If Europe falls into war because of misunderstandings, the terror of it goes without saying. The Labor Party's attitude towards the conscription issue is very regrettable, but the Labor Party's remarks on this matter are not enough to represent the people whom it claims to represent. This is what I am satisfied with. We now only need to obtain a slight reduction in the burden of international tensions, and then there are many signs that we can expect great progress in trade and prosperity, which will benefit everyone in the world. The Prime Minister concluded by saying that the power to restore trust is not entirely in our hands, but as long as I am in office, I will continue to work to restore trust without the slightest懈云. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Conservative Party Women's Association held a meeting in Albert Hall today, and Prime Minister Chamberlain personally attended and delivered a speech, briefly saying, "Nothing can draw us into the vortex of war, but if we absolutely believe that war cannot be avoided unless we sacrifice freedom and honor, then it is another matter. We resolve disputes by always adopting negotiation methods. If others want to replace negotiation with force, we will inevitably correct it with all necessary measures. At that time, I deeply believe that you will definitely support me." Germany need not fear Britain unless it intends to control the entire world. Although Germany has now abolished the 1935 Anglo-German Naval Agreement, Britain still views it as an emblem of the fact that the two nations do not want to resort to arms. German leader Hitler once said that Britain and Germany could very well avoid an arms race and that Germany was willing to negotiate with Britain on the naval issue. Britain should carefully consider this statement and should immediately provide Germany with an answer. In short, the government has prepared everything militarily, but this does not mean that war is imminent. It is the government's intention that the more powerful Britain becomes, the more thorough the preparation to resist the attacker and destroy the attacker will be, and the less likely the peaceful situation will be to be destroyed. This is all that we believe." (11th Havas Dispatch)</p>

She also said that the President has continuously appealed to all countries in the world to discuss ways to maintain peace. (12th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Speeches of British and French Authorities Are Valued by Various Newspapers; German Political Circles Express Indifference</h3>
<p>(London) The speeches delivered yesterday by Prime Minister Chamberlain of Britain and Premier Daladier of France have been commented on unanimously by the newspapers here, which all say that the opinions of Britain and France are completely consistent and that this is a warning, hoping that countries with aggressive intentions will not ignore it. The Times stated that Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy has won the support of the entire British nation, and that Premier Daladier's statement that "there is now a new tactic that attempts to destroy the moral force with false threats without fighting, and the French people will resist it with one heart and one mind" is pleasing to the ear and will also be supported by the entire nation. The "Daily Telegraph" stated, "The foreign policies adopted by the two great free democratic nations are the same goal, the same method, and the two countries are completely united. This is unprecedented." (12th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The people in political circles here have expressed calmness towards the speech delivered by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in London yesterday, believing that this speech was made specifically for the British domestic audience and that its purpose was to prove the necessity of Britain's huge military spending. As for the Danzig issue, people in political circles in Berlin strongly stated that the Danzig issue does not need to be discussed at all, because it is a German city without a doubt, and it has nothing to do with Poland's sovereignty and independence. If Britain wants to come out and interfere in the Danzig issue, then Germany can announce that this kind of interference will neither contribute to peace nor be a manifestation of British neutrality. (12th Haitong Dispatch) Warsaw: The speech delivered yesterday by French Premier Daladier in the National Assembly has been translated into Polish and broadcast here, so the political bigwigs of Poland have had the opportunity to listen to it. The newspapers here have unanimously praised it. The Warsaw Post stated, "Premier Daladier's speech is of great significance for maintaining peace in Europe, and it will definitely have a decisive impact on the development of the situation in the future. His wording and intention are firm and clear, and he has thoroughly explained where France's true confidence lies. In other words, France is willing to maintain peace, but it must be based on justice and mutual respect for rights, and it is prepared to deal with all eventualities. Any attempt to extort or use pressure will undoubtedly cause a major war." The "Morning Express" compared Premier Daladier's speech with the speech delivered yesterday by British Prime Minister Chamberlain in the House of Commons, briefly saying that "The politicians of Britain and France have clearly explained their attitude towards the peaceful situation. Those who are still harboring fantasies should know to be vigilant." The people in political circles here are very gratified for the guarantee provided by Britain and France to maintain Poland's independence. (12th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Decides to Postpone Meeting</h3>
<p>(Geneva) People in the League of Nations have just announced that the Soviet government plans to postpone the date of the regular meeting of the Administrative Council from the 15th of this month to the 22nd so that the Soviet Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Potemkin, can come here to participate in it as Chairman.

<h3>Britain and Turkey Agree on a Long-Term Mutual Assistance Agreement; The Two Sides Decide to Cooperate in the Mediterranean and Seek to Guarantee the Security of the Balkans</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain reported to the House of Commons at 3:00 PM today on the negotiations between Britain and Turkey, briefly saying, "After a close exchange of views between the governments of Britain and Turkey, followed by negotiations, the consistency of the views of both sides was seen. These negotiations are now continuing, and it has been agreed to conclude a long-term agreement of a mutual nature to ensure the security of both countries. Before the agreement is completed, the two governments also declare in advance that in the event of an act of aggression that could cause war on the Mediterranean coast, both parties should cooperate effectively and implement mutual assistance. Our conclusion of this agreement is not aimed at any country. Our intention is that Britain and Turkey can assist each other when necessary, and the governments of both countries recognize that certain issues should be carefully studied before the completion of the agreement, allowing it to be about the definition of the terms of implementing mutual assistance. This issue is currently being studied. In addition, the two governments also recognize that the security of the entire Balkan Peninsula must also be urgently established and are also exchanging views so that this goal can be achieved as soon as possible. One thing that must be stated is that after the above-mentioned agreement is established, the signing parties are not prohibited from concluding agreements with other countries for the general interest of consolidating peace." Prime Minister Chamberlain also said that the Turkish side made the same statement today about the negotiations. When the Prime Minister spoke, all members of parliament applauded enthusiastically to express their approval and welcomed his statement that the security of the entire Balkan Peninsula also needs to be defended.

<p>(Berlin) The semi-official political and diplomatic correspondence newspaper recently published an article warning Turkey not to join the encirclement of Germany, saying, "Britain and France often say that the German-Italian axis is trying to reduce the countries of Southeastern Europe to vassals, and they intimidate Turkey with this. All that they say can only be regarded as historical relics, not as current facts, because Germany and Italy will respect the interests and independence of each of those countries. All they ask for is harmonious cooperation with those countries in their geographical and economic space for survival and reproduction. But if a certain country intends to use this space as a base to infringe upon the interests of Germany and Italy, then Germany and Italy will naturally have to respond accordingly." (12th Havas)</p>

<h3>Germany's Annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia Further Weakens its Economic Status</h3>
<p>Chicago: According to Dr. Georgi, former advisor to the German National Bank, speaking to the U.S. Trade Association today, "As a result of Germany's aggression, its economic position and military crisis have become more profound. As a result, Germany has no choice but to take even more risks and continue to invade elsewhere. And in terms of the land that Germany has currently obtained, it not only does not provide any benefits in terms of raw materials and food, but it is also even more unfavorable, because Germany itself is a highly developed industrial country, but most of the land that it has recently acquired is also an industrial area, and its nature is mostly similar to that of Germany, so the result is only to disperse and reduce the supply of raw materials." Hitler's annexation of Austria did capture 60 million yuan of Austrian gold, but this amount is not enough to cover the military expenditure of the occupying Austrian forces. The gold captured in Czechoslovakia is only enough to support Germany's international trade for half a year to offset losses from imports, "Therefore, from the surface, Germany's annexation of Austria and Czechoslovakia seems to have increased a lot in terms of raw materials, foreign exchange, gold reserves, armaments, and manpower, but in reality, it is like taking meat to heal sores."

<h3>American Concern: Situation in Shanghai Concessions, Cooperation with Britain to Address Japanese Demands, Report from Consul-General in Shanghai Under Study</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to reports last night, Britain and the United States are now cooperating to prepare a formal response to Japan's demands regarding the Shanghai International Settlement. State Department officials are reportedly studying the situation in Shanghai based on a detailed report submitted by the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss. It is expected that the State Department will exchange views with the British Foreign Office before taking action. Furthermore, according to well-informed sources, the situation in Shanghai is now the most serious since the start of the Sino-Japanese War. Unofficial predictions suggest that if Japan does not resolve all issues with a compromising attitude, particularly regarding foreign rights and interests in Shanghai, the favorable impact on U.S.-Japan relations resulting from Japan's refusal to sign a military alliance with Germany and Italy will be completely lost. Several observers firmly believe that any drastic action taken by Japan would be sufficient to promote the passage of the Pittman Act by Congress. Once this act is implemented, it would prohibit the transportation of American goods to Japan, cutting off the majority of the military supplies upon which Japan relies for its aggression against China.

<h3>U.S. Coal Miners' Strike Soon to be Resolved</h3>
<p>(New York) Following the strike by 320,000 miners in the Appalachian coal region, another 126,000 miners in the Midwest and Southern mines have followed suit. To end the strike as soon as possible, President Roosevelt has personally assumed the role of mediator and issued an appeal, advising both labor and management to negotiate a solution. John L. Lewis, chairman of the Committee for Industrial Organization, responded today and telegraphed representatives of the United Mine Workers of America in mining areas outside the Appalachian region, instructing them to sign an agreement with management on behalf of the union, extending the current work contract for two years until March 31, 1941, so that the 126,000 striking workers in those mining areas can resume work first, but with two conditions: (1) Management must recognize the United Mine Workers of America as the sole representative of the workers; (2) All miners in each mining area must join the United Mine Workers of America. Responsible individuals here have commented that if the striking workers in the Midwest and South can resume work as soon as possible, the strike situation should ease. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(New York) Steelman, the government mediator in the Appalachian coal miners' strike, issued a statement today saying that the deadlock no longer exists. John L. Lewis, president of the United Mine Workers, has authorized 150,000 miners to sign contracts separately with employers willing to comply, so the strike is not far from resolution. The aforementioned miners are not in the Appalachian region where the strike occurred. Employers and union representatives in that region are still in discussions, and both sides say a settlement can be reached by Friday afternoon. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Newspaper Explains Attitude Towards Negotiations with Britain, Mutual Assistance Agreement on Equal Footing Needed to Cope with European Situation</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Izvestia newspaper published an editorial today stating, "Events in recent weeks have fundamentally changed the situation in Europe. We refer primarily to Hitler's speech in the German Reichstag, and secondly to the conclusion of the Italo-German military and political alliance. Western European political leaders mostly claim that these two events have not changed the situation in Europe. This is not true; on the contrary, the purpose of such arguments is to deceive public opinion. In fact, these two events have certainly made the overall political situation worse. First, as a result of Hitler's speech in the Reichstag, two important agreements have been abolished. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement has been cancelled since Hitler's speech, and the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact has also ceased to exist due to Hitler's speech. Can the sudden cancellation of two such important treaties not be said to have caused a change in the international situation? As for the establishment of the Italo-German political and military alliance, it has undoubtedly dealt a major blow to the European situation before the event. Certain countries have hoped and attempted to break up Italo-German relations and isolate Germany. These hopes and attempts are now completely futile. The Soviet people have repeatedly declared that the Anti-Comintern Pact of Germany, Italy, and Japan is a mask to conceal the aggressive bloc against Britain and France. In the past, many people did not believe it or even condemned it, but now the facts fully prove it. This environment has prompted democratic countries to intensify their efforts to form a united front for peace to resist developing aggression. As for the negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union, various politicians and the press have recently spread malicious rumors about the Soviet attitude regarding these negotiations, falsely claiming that the Soviet Union demands that even if it does not immediately take hostile action against aggressors, it should conclude a direct military alliance with Britain and France. This fallacy, which is completely different from the Soviet attitude, is not worth refuting. The Soviet Union's past and future claim is that if Britain and France truly want to create a bulwark against aggression in Europe, they must form a united front of mutual assistance, which should include Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and Poland, or at least Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. We must point out that this frank, fundamentally defensive, and peaceful Soviet attitude, which is based on mutual principles and equal obligations, has not been sympathetically echoed by Britain and France. As is well known, Britain, with the consent of France, has put forward a counterproposal, in which Britain avoids discussing the issue of a mutual assistance pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and instead suggests that the Soviet Union should provide immediate assistance when Britain and France are drawn into hostile actions as a result of implementing guarantees for Poland and Romania. However, there is no mention of the assistance that the Soviet Union should receive from Britain and France in accordance with the principle of reciprocity when it is drawn into hostile action as a result of fulfilling obligations to guarantee any country in Eastern Europe or that it will give. Thus, under this arrangement, the Soviet Union undertakes exactly the same obligations as Britain and France, but its position is not equal. At the same time, the following highly significant fact is even more self-evident, namely that under this arrangement, the power to decide the actual resistance to aggression, when and how to start resistance, is entirely in the hands of Britain and France, although the task of resistance, due to geographical reasons, should mainly be borne by the Soviet Union. Some say that Britain and France's defense of Poland and Romania is actually equal to defending the Soviet Union's western border. This statement is absolutely untrue. First, the Soviet Union's western border is not limited to the two Baltic countries. Second, and also the main point, Britain and France's defense of the two Baltic countries is actually defending their own countries, not the Soviet Union's western border, because they have mutual assistance pacts with Poland. Poland must in turn defend Britain and France against aggression. As for Romania, because it has a treaty of alliance with Poland, it must follow Poland's lead, and Romania will in fact also be an indirect ally of Britain and France. The Soviet Union's position is completely different. It has no mutual assistance pacts with Britain, France, and Poland, and now it should promise to assist the aforementioned three countries without receiving any assistance from the three countries, and when the Soviet Union is directly invaded, it can only rely on its own strength. Thus, the Soviet Union is obviously in an unequal position again." (TASS dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Newspaper Brags About Itself</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, the Asahi Shimbun prominently published news of Japan's mediation efforts in the German-Polish issue. It is claimed that a few days ago, Japan informally mediated between Germany and Poland to ease tensions between the two countries. Japan reportedly suggested that Germany and Poland hold candid talks to eliminate friction between the two countries and restore friendly relations. It is reported that neither the German nor Polish governments have responded, but the Japanese government is prepared to have the Japanese ambassadors to Germany and Poland initiate negotiations immediately when this suggestion is accepted.

Political figures here have denied this, saying that it is absurd and that they would never want to see "Runciman" come to Warsaw.

<h3>Daladier's Speech Welcomes British Conscription, Franco-Russian Assistance Agreement Still Valid, Determined to Resist Aggression Hereafter</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies resumed this afternoon. Premier Daladier immediately delivered an important speech, the main points of which have been seen in yesterday's telegrams. The original text is as follows: Premier Daladier first stated that the key to the European situation is actually only one question: control by force or peaceful cooperation. In other words, whether the outstanding issues of conflicting interests among nations should be resolved through peaceful cooperation or liquidated through violent means is the crux of the problem. Recently, certain countries have been insincere, providing promises on the surface while harboring ulterior motives, and acts of breaking commitments, tearing up agreements, annexing neighboring countries, and conquering foreign races have emerged one after another. All of these are recent events that need no further elaboration. Or, under the pretext of economic needs, political demands are made, which are also clearly visible to all. The means used by these countries are nothing more than a few: infringing on the territory of other countries; making insatiable demands that may lead to war; constantly expanding armaments, forcing the people to bear huge expenditures, leading to popular discontent, and even if other countries offer cooperative suggestions, it will be in vain. Looking back at our country, we have never threatened any country and treat all countries equally, willing to cooperate with them. Our country's current policy focuses on calling on peace-loving people and countries to unite with each other to maintain peace. As far as Britain is concerned, the close relationship between Britain and France has never been so close as it is today. This is the cornerstone of our country's policy and will never allow any despicable conspiracies or false propaganda to destroy it. To this day, the British people have realized the difficulties of the times, broken with traditional habits, and voluntarily accepted compulsory military service. The French people are delighted and express their friendly respect to them." As far as the United States is concerned, President Roosevelt's telegram is deeply admired by us and immediately expressed full support. Our country has always advocated the conclusion of universal agreements with countries that are determined to protect their own security, but the more universal the nature of the agreement, the more difficult it is to detail the terms. "For this reason, our country will conclude simple and clear agreements with all countries that are willing to cooperate with France to safeguard their vital interests and has obtained agreement with Britain, and in other parts of Europe, it voluntarily provides unilateral guarantees to certain countries, and until now, it still takes into account the actual situation and conducts negotiations with other countries. All of this is nothing more than wanting to cooperate with all peace-loving countries." At this point, Premier Daladier reviewed France's commitments to Romania, Greece, and Poland, and said, "At a time when Poland is safeguarding its vital interests, our country's commitments to that country are increasingly important. In addition, our country is negotiating an agreement with Turkey to safeguard peace in the eastern Mediterranean, where the interests of France and Turkey complement each other, and the outstanding issues between the two sides should also be resolved in a spirit of friendship. As for the Soviet Union, we hope that country will participate in mutual organizations. The 1935 Franco-Soviet mutual assistance agreement is still valid. In order to see that our country's consistent foreign policy program is still based on equal status and mutual principles, it is cooperating with the Soviet Union. Although there are differences of opinion on the form of the agreement negotiated by the British, French, and Soviet governments, the key point of the agreement, which is to cooperate to safeguard peace, has been obvious since the beginning of the negotiations." In short, Britain and France have accepted the same obligations in Central Europe and the Near East, which is a pioneering move. "The policy it is pursuing is to maintain the freedom and independence of all nations. The peace we desire is a peace based on respect for all rights. Violence and threats can bring great disasters to Europe. Our country should cooperate with all countries that want to live in honor to resist them." Our country's people must make efforts internally in order to implement a firm policy externally. We have taken various military measures to strengthen national defense and do not intend to reduce them for the time being. If large-scale mobilizations outside the border continue unabated, then these measures must be strengthened. Our country's will is firm, unyielding, and will never allow others to alienate it and fall into division.

"If others want to lay the foundation for peace based on justice and equality, we are happy to hear it. On the contrary, if others want to disrupt peace, then please ask them to take on our sharp edge. As for those who seek to exhaust our country's strength with a situation of neither war nor peace, our country will thoroughly deal with it. We are not afraid of both force and cunning."

<h3>Disputes in Danzig Emerge Constantly, National Socialist Party Leader Speaks</h3>
<p>Says They Will Achieve Their Ultimate Goal Warsaw: Two more incidents occurred in recent days at the borders between Poland and Germany, and between the Free City of Danzig and Germany. The semi-official Pat Communications Agency reported that on the evening of the 9th of this month, two Polish-German individuals were piloting a small boat to secretly cross the Obra River to escape to Germany when they were spotted by border guards. The guards fired warning shots that were ineffective, so they fired, killing one and wounding one. It is said that these individuals wanted to go to Germany to enlist in the army. In addition, in the town of Kargow on the border between the Free City of Danzig and the East Prussian Province of Germany, a number of rioters in cars threw bombs at the tax card, destroying its buildings and fleeing without a trace. (Havas dispatch, 11th) Warsaw: Yesterday, an incident occurred on the border between Danzig and Poland that fortunately did not lead to disaster. Two Danzig residents were traveling from Danzig to Polish territory. When they reached the bridge to the border, five Polish police officers ordered them to stop. The two Danzig residents did not obey the order because they were still 80 yards away from the border bridge. As a result, the Polish police fired three shots at them, fortunately all of which missed. It is expected that the Danzig Senate will discuss this matter. (Haitong dispatch, 12th) Danzig: According to the Danziger Zeitung, yesterday, two artillery units in Poland strengthened the defenses of the port of Gdynia, 10 miles from Danzig. Due to the tense international political situation, Poles in the port have been particularly anxious recently, so Poland's move may be aimed at stabilizing morale. (Haitong dispatch, 12th) Danzig: Danzig Free City Senate President Greiser met with German labor leaders today and said, "All the rumors in foreign newspapers and the mobilization measures outside our borders cannot make us lose our minds. Our destiny will be decided by Führer Hitler. Once the areas inhabited by Germans in Eastern Europe are resolved, our destiny can be decided. The Danzig people's fighting spirit and ability to know themselves and their enemies are their strengths, so the unrest near the border of the Free City will never make the Danzig people abandon their traditional calmness. This is the spirit of National Socialism and the best guarantee that the Danzig people will sooner or later achieve the historical demands explained by Hitler in his speech to parliament."

<h3>Southwest Provinces Still Plagued by Opium, Chairman Chiang Reiterates Prohibition Order, Absolutely Prohibiting Planting Within This Year, No Further Discoveries Allowed, Instructing All Responsible Personnel to Fully Cooperate and Conscientiously Execute, Anyone Found in Violation Will Be Punished for Disobeying Orders and Breaking the Law</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang issued an order to the southwestern provinces on the 9th, strictly prohibiting the planting of opium. (Omitted honorifics) Investigating and banning opium is a crucial political task, and getting to the root of the problem requires focusing on prohibiting planting. Sichuan and Guizhou provinces reported last year that planting would be eradicated by the end of the year, and I sent separate telegrams of commendation. Kang province, according to opium prohibition laws, is an absolutely prohibited area for planting. Since I came to Sichuan, I have repeatedly emphasized strict investigation and eradication. However, the actual situation this year is that there is a lot of clandestine planting in various areas, and the area is vast, making the situation serious. Until recently, with the harvest approaching, knowing that eradication would be too late and the planting households valuing the high profits, they reported and dispatched personnel for eradication. Considering the reality, how can this be effective? This situation not only borders on perfunctory, accepting reports but failing to implement them, disobeying orders and failing to comply, but also involves a major error of self-deception. How can we accomplish the mission of the revolution? It is truly regrettable! I hereby issue another handwritten order of admonishment, requiring all provinces under your jurisdiction, as well as border areas, to absolutely prohibit planting within this year. No reason shall be allowed to tolerate even a single sprout. All responsible officials of the Party, government, and military in each province must be deeply vigilant, make a firm resolution, and immediately after receiving the order, jointly discuss effective measures, take full responsibility, and supervise all levels of agencies and responsible personnel to cooperate and conscientiously implement. Regarding all publicity, investigation, and eradication efforts, they must be strictly enforced before planting and at the beginning of germination, to avoid the disadvantages of being caught unprepared and to achieve the success of planning ahead. You must know that the southwestern provinces are the base for the War of Resistance and national revival, and the scourge of opium is a major threat to the War of Resistance in these provinces. We must do everything we can to eradicate it and never allow it to spread. Anyone who shelters, connives, or takes advantage of it for personal gain is a public enemy of the Party and the nation. No matter what position they hold or what connections they have, they must be resolutely punished according to the law, without any leniency. I sincerely hope that you will carefully follow these instructions and work together. If I find any violations again, the responsible officials of the Party, government, and military will be held accountable and punished for disobeying orders and breaking the law. Do not treat this as a mere formality. Report the progress of your compliance at any time. Chiang Kai-shek's handwritten order, for your confidential service. Printed in Chongqing.

<h3>Hebei South China Army Recovers Linqing</h3>
<p>(Zhengzhou) A certain unit of the Hebei South China Army launched a fierce attack on Linqing at 10 PM on the 8th. They entered the city and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese army, fighting fiercely day and night. The Japanese army could not withstand the attack and retreated in defeat towards the west gate. Linqing was recovered by the Chinese army. It is estimated that over 40 Japanese soldiers were killed, over 10 drowned, and one Japanese pacification official, Mimura, one Japanese soldier, and one Chinese traitor leader were captured. Over 10 rifles and one pistol were seized. (Telegraph of the 12th)</p>
<h3>Financial Chaos in Beijing and Tianjin Under Japanese Control, "United Reserve" Counterfeit Notes Plunge in Value, Chinese and Foreign Merchants Do Not Trust Them, Clearly Showing the Failure of the Japanese Strategy</h3>
<p>A Beijing dispatch in the *North-China Daily News* on May 2nd stated: The *North-China Daily News* recently published an article by a Tokyo correspondent, stating that the Japanese authorities are currently drafting a grand plan to develop gold mines in the border area of Rehe and Manchuria. It also stated that the gold obtained would be used to increase the resources of the newly established "United Reserve Bank" in Beijing and help establish control over North China's finance and expand the region's foreign trade. If the bank's hope of increasing its resources depends solely on this, then such assistance will be long in coming. Currently, due to the continued sharp decline in the value of "United Reserve" banknotes, North China is facing a severe monetary crisis. At the time of writing, "United Reserve" currency was being exchanged for legal tender at a discount of over 35%. The decline continues day after day. The currency problem has become the sole topic of discussion here in recent days, even eclipsing discussions of the war situation. The residents of Beijing are now looking worried, whispering to each other, "The new currency is going to be worthless." They seem quite shocked. This has particularly reduced the credibility of those so-called financiers, because those who know the contents of the "United Reserve" have from the beginning asserted that this kind of currency without any reserve cannot possibly gain value, no matter how the Japanese can use their pronouncements and bayonets to make it valuable. The public's panic has some justification, because we are now seeing some of the symptoms of financial chaos, such as the rising cost of living. Stores are raising the prices of various goods every day. Necessities such as flour and kerosene, and all imported goods, are rising in price. A 40-pound bag of American flour that could be bought for six yuan three weeks ago now costs seven yuan and twenty cents. Railway ticket prices have almost doubled, and return tickets cannot be purchased. Even local taxes have been increased several times. Some foreign stores have recently begun to set prices in pounds or gold dollars. The free exchange of "United Reserve" currency for Japanese yen at par has been restricted, and the restrictions are now even tighter. Only specially permitted Japanese stores can obtain a limited amount of Japanese yen at the Yokohama Specie Bank. There are various reasons given for the devaluation of the "United Reserve" currency. One explanation is that a large amount of foreign flour is imported into North China, and importers have to pay for it in foreign exchange, which can only be obtained with legal tender. However, the Japanese have issued regulations to search for and confiscate legal tender, forcing it out of formal circulation. Therefore, a large amount of legal tender can only be obtained with a very high premium. This is one reason, but not all the reasons. While this can explain the price increase of a few commodities and the relatively high premium on legal tender, it does not account for the sudden and severe drop in the value of "United Reserve" currency and the widespread distrust. It is widely rumored that Japanese residents in North China are willing to pay any price to buy legal tender. This is one example. Many believe this is the cause of the continuous decline in the value of "United Reserve" currency. There are also rumors outside that the Japanese yen will soon be devalued, which makes the general public even more uneasy. The "United Reserve" currency, currently worth about six pence and five farthings, can be exchanged for a limited amount of Japanese yen, which is officially priced at one shilling and two pence. This fact alone makes the financial chaos here clear. Observers who coldly observe similar financial oddities in other parts of the world will now find that Chinese merchants who only a few months ago insisted on being paid in "United Reserve" currency are now eagerly requesting customers to pay in legal tender instead. Or they will see stores that previously firmly announced that they only accept "United Reserve" currency are now reissuing notices stating that they will set their prices in some kind of gold coin in the future. This should not cause any surprise. There are many on the Japanese side who are talking about taking "drastic measures" now, but even Japan's military and financial resources cannot explain what kind of bold measures can make a worthless currency valuable. There are also suggestions to stop all imports into North China. This measure might temporarily prevent the "United Reserve" currency from continuing to fall, but it would only be temporary and would further increase financial chaos. The implementation of this measure would cut off the source of some essential goods that cannot be obtained from Japan. The cost of living would therefore continue to rise, which would have an adverse effect on the Japanese yen and would lead to widespread smuggling. The exchange rate of the "United Reserve" currency would still not be resolved. Products from most of the inland areas, such as cotton, peanuts, and eggs, still have to be paid for in legal tender, and legal tender is scarce, so it is gradually rising in value. Finally, it is doubtful that restricting imports today will restore trust in the unprepared "United Reserve" currency. The only sound way is to admit failure and gradually withdraw the new currency, just as a large amount of Japanese yen flowed into China last year. But this is just a piece of advice that the Japanese will certainly not adopt. Seeing that the Japanese monetary experiment in North China has suffered a disastrous failure, and that Japanese military and financial experts are now determined to use another "independent" new currency in Central China, it is even more evident that they will not accept advice.</p>
<h3>The Story of the Chinese Army in Danshui Estuary Luring the Enemy Into an Empty Fort, The Japanese Army Only Occupied Danshui Estuary for Two Days, and Had Already Withdrawn Before the Chinese Army Launched a Counterattack</h3>
<p>A Hong Kong dispatch stated that Danshui Estuary, which belongs to Kaiping County, is located at the center of transportation for the five counties of Xin, Kai, Tai, En, and Chi, and is also the rear guard of Heshan, making it of great military importance. On the 28th of last month, the town was once invaded by the Japanese army, who were stationed there for two days. On May 1st, they suddenly withdrew. At that time, all ferry services to Sanbu from Macau were suspended, and transportation was blocked. The situation in that area could not be detailed. According to Mr. So-and-so, a manager of a certain shipping company, the situation of the Japanese army's occupation of Danshui Estuary on that day is as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. So-and-so said that after the fall of Jiangmen and Xinhui, the Japanese army planned to advance into Danshui Estuary and sent planes to scout multiple times. It was heard that the Japanese army's initial plan was to occupy the front of the Ningyang Railway, suddenly pass through Daze Siqian, and attack Danshui Estuary. However, the railway there had long been dismantled by the Chinese army, all bridges had been blown up, and the roads along the villages had been thoroughly destroyed. Guerrillas were scattered throughout the villages and deep in the mountain valleys and palm groves, appearing and disappearing unpredictably, and constantly intercepting the Japanese army. At the same time, a regular army unit was guarding the Daze Siqian and Fenshui River Estuary areas. The Japanese army was blocked by the Chinese army and was afraid of penetrating deep into the land, extending the battle line, and not being able to connect the front and rear. Therefore, the plan to attack Danshui Estuary by land was stopped, and defensive fortifications were set up in the Fenshui River Estuary and Daze areas, adopting a defensive posture. For more than 20 days, the two armies were in a stalemate at Daze Siqian, engaging in small-scale, seesaw-like contact. However, Danshui Estuary was a stronghold that the Japanese army wanted to seize. Since it was difficult to advance by land, they changed to using their superior navy to invade by water. Until the 27th of last month, three shallow-draft small warships, accompanied by two armored motorboats and rubber boats, sailed upstream from Xinhui. On the morning of the 28th, they broke into the Danshui Estuary Yigong River defense line. At around 8 AM, the Japanese warships approached Danshui Estuary and first fired four shots, bombing Danshui Estuary, followed by two or three hundred rounds of machine gun fire. At that time, the Chinese army guarding Danshui Estuary only had more than 200 local self-defense troops and more than 100 guerrilla soldiers. When they discovered that the Japanese warships were sailing to Niowan waters, they made a planned retreat. When the Japanese warships sailed to the Danshui Estuary River surface and fired, there was not a single Chinese soldier stationed in the market town. Therefore, when the Japanese warships fired, they did not see the Chinese army return fire. The Japanese warships patrolled the river surface for an hour before putting down rubber boats to disembark more than 200 Japanese soldiers. They first occupied the Shuikou Township Office and the elementary school. Later, the Japanese army captain Yoshimizu led soldiers and divided into three groups to search the shops and houses in the market town to investigate whether there were any hidden guns or guerrilla soldiers. The search lasted for three or four hours, and they distributed leaflets door-to-door. The wording was all kinds of fallacies to lure the people to surrender peacefully. However, most of the goods in the entire market town had been moved elsewhere, and the people had also been evacuated. Only the elderly, weak men and women, and the poor who had no one to turn to were unable to move and still lived in the market town. The Japanese army captain then ordered the arrest of dozens of elderly men and took them back to the team headquarters, asking for the names of the district and township chiefs and forcing them to hand over the district and township chiefs. However, the district and township chiefs had long since fled, and in fact, there was no way to find them. Later, the Japanese army re-arrested the elderly men as guides, ordering them to lead dozens of Japanese soldiers to nearby small villages to capture pigs, chickens, geese, and ducks, and search for rice for a communal meal. However, because the language was not understood, a certain sergeant who knew a little Chinese entered the village and ordered the villagers to hand over pigs and chickens to be slaughtered and cooked. He gestured by making a fist with his left hand and using his right hand to open his palm in the shape of a knife, frequently waving his palm to make a head-chopping motion. The villagers, seeing this, thought that the Japanese army was indicating that they wanted to kill the villagers, and were greatly angered. They hurriedly beat gongs to warn and gathered hundreds of strong men to drive away the Japanese soldiers who had gone down to the village. The Japanese soldiers, seeing that the situation was not good and that they were outnumbered, hurriedly fled back to Danshui Estuary and regrouped to dispatch a large number of troops to the village. The villagers, seeing the large Japanese army covering up, knew that their strength was weak and could not resist, so they supported the old and carried the young, and the whole family escaped into the mountains. The Japanese army then plundered all the livestock and miscellaneous items in the village. The next day, the regular army of a certain division of the Chinese army, together with the guerrillas and self-defense forces, totaling three or four thousand people, launched a counterattack on Danshui Estuary in three routes. One route moved out from Zhaiwu, one route traveled down the Hai Shun River from Kai Niu Biao, and one route moved out from Baisha on the south bank, preparing to completely encircle and annihilate the Japanese army that had invaded Danshui Estuary. Unexpectedly, a traitor leaked the news to the Japanese army several hours in advance. At 4 PM on the 29th, a Japanese plane suddenly flew from the Yamen area to Danshui Estuary, circling low several times. After a while, a bundle of leaflet-style orders was dropped from the plane and distributed in the market town. The leaflets were purely in Japanese, explaining that the Chinese army was luring their army to penetrate deep and encircling them, and urgently ordered all Japanese troops stationed in the market town to withdraw back to the ship, not to stay in the market town for long. The Japanese army received this urgent message and took advantage of the dusk to withdraw their troops to the ship and leave the Danshui Estuary River surface. One hour after the Japanese army had just withdrawn, the Chinese army arrived in three routes, encircling and recovering the market town, but unexpectedly, the Japanese warships had already fully loaded the Japanese troops and retreated from the Danshui Estuary River surface. After the Japanese army withdrew, the situation in Tai Kai and other areas had turned from danger to safety. Since May 1st, the ships and ferries traveling between Macau and Xinchang, Dihai, Changsha, and Sanbu have resumed normal operations. As of the 6th, the Chinese land forces were still guarding Daze Siqian, with no fierce contact.</p>
<h3>Terror in Jiangyin Repeatedly Occurs, Japanese Puppets Rush to Organize Baos and Jias, Residents Must Obtain "Good Citizen Certificates"</h3>
<p>A Jiangyin dispatch stated that before the war, there were more than 20,000 households and more than 53,000 men and women in the urban area of Chengyi. Household registration statistics were meticulously conducted. After the fall of Jiangcheng, some people lived in other towns for a long time. Driven by the need for livelihood, although they returned one after another, the population is still only about half of what it was originally. After two incidents occurred in the city a month ago in which brave men shot and killed the puppet detectives Yang Hanqing and Xiao Huangmao, the Japanese puppets tried their best to organize baos and jias, dividing the city into eight wards (i.e., eight baos) and 203 jias. Residents, regardless of gender, must obtain "Good Citizen Certificates." On the 8th of this month, the puppet magistrate He Peixuan convened a meeting of all bao and jia chiefs. What was most ridiculous was that most of the attendees were wives and daughters of the chiefs, while the men dared not come out. He Peixuan made a first and foremost point, paying attention to the population in the city, and that each jia chief was responsible for ten households. The women who attended all replied with "yes, yes."</p>
<h3>Puppet Regime Plans to Levy Cocoon Tax, Six Yuan Per Dan</h3>
<p>A Wuxi dispatch stated that the weather has been warm recently, and silkworms in the counties of Xi and Chang are developing very rapidly, having begun their first molt and leaf emergence. The price of mulberry leaves is three yuan per dan. The "Central China Company," organized by the Japanese puppets, has abandoned control due to the difficulty of extending its power to the countryside, and allows Chinese merchants to freely collect cocoons. However, puppet checkpoints have been set up at key points in the occupied areas to levy taxes. The method has been formulated by the Puppet Provincial Construction Department. All Chinese merchants who collect cocoons should fill out a form and register before May 20th, paying a deposit of three yuan per city dan (50 kilograms) of dry cocoons, calculated at fifteen dan of dry cocoons per single stove in each business. The deposit will be refunded after the cocoon market closes. Another six yuan per city dan of dry cocoons will be levied as a "silkworm industry improvement fee." If cocoons are dried for farmers, the limited price for each dan of drying fee is eleven yuan. If cocoon merchants want to transport the cocoons they have collected, they should fill out a "Dry Cocoon Transportation Request Form" and a "Dry Cocoon Weighing Report Form," and send them to the local puppet county government. They must also pay an improvement fee to obtain a "Dry Cocoon Fee Payment Certificate" and paste it on the cocoon bag before they can be transported away. Otherwise, if the puppet checkpoints discover it, in addition to confiscating the dry cocoons, a fine of up to 200 yuan will be imposed. In this situation, they are actually still manipulated by the Japanese puppets, because the transport of dry cocoons for export cannot escape their difficulties.</p>

<h3>New Factories Surge After the War, Yarn Factories Gather in Shanghai, Factories in Occupied Areas Illegally Taken Over by the Japanese, Chinese Yarn Sells Well in the Southwestern Provinces and Guerrilla Areas</h3>
<p>After the coastal cities fell one after another, the yarn factory industry suffered severe damage. The factories refused to cooperate with the Japanese and established new yarn factories in the Shanghai concession area. Ten factories, including Xinsheng, have been completed and put into operation. However, the raw materials are monopolized by the Japanese, so they had to order foreign cotton to supplement their needs. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai is the Gathering Place for Yarn Factories</p>
<p>The distribution area of ​​textile factories in our country was concentrated in coastal cities before the war, especially Jiangsu, which has a long history. This is because of the suitability of the terrain and climate, the convenience of transportation, the activity of finance, and the excellence of the market. Therefore, its progress is more than comparable to other provinces. There are a total of 148 factories in the country, and Jiangsu Province has 88 factories, accounting for 59.5% of the total. Shanghai is the most developed, ranking in the leading position of yarn factories in the country, with 65 factories, accounting for 73.9% of the total number of factories in the province. Among them, 31 are Chinese-owned, 30 are Japanese-owned, and 4 are British-owned. Therefore, Shanghai is not only the gathering place for Chinese-owned yarn factories, but also the center of gravity for foreign-owned yarn factories.</p>
<p>Wartime Yarn Factories Taken Over by the Japanese</p>
<p>After the coastal cities fell one after another, most of the wartime yarn factories were destroyed by artillery fire. Even those that were spared were incomplete in their internal components. At the same time, the Japanese attempted to take over by force, so there was no possibility of recovery. However, Zhenhua Yarn Factory in Yangshupu, with 13,928 spindles, was leased by Heji with the approval of the Japanese through the relationship of You Jusun of the "Citizens Association" and started spinning as usual. Among the factories within the war zone that have been taken over and put into operation by the Japanese, there are Shenxin and Yong'an factories. But it has nothing to do with the original factories. All are illegally taken over and put into operation by the Japanese, and some of them have foreign connections, which the Japanese also ignore, even after unsuccessful negotiations.</p>
<p>Ten New Factories in Concessions Put Into Operation</p>
<p>All yarn factories in the occupied areas firmly refused to cooperate with the Japanese. They were willing to sacrifice business and set up new factories in the Shanghai concession area. However, most of them were established in the name of foreign merchants such as British and American companies. According to the investigation by the reporter of Xinsheng News Agency, the factories that have already started operations are: (1) Xinhe 25,000 spindles, (2) Xieji 2,600 spindles, (3) Anda 15,000 spindles, (4) Taifeng 15,000 spindles, (5) Xinsheng 16,000 spindles, (6) Zhaoxing 6,000 spindles, (7) Rongfeng 15,000 spindles, (8) Zhongfang 20,000 spindles, (9) Defeng 8,300 spindles, (10) Baofeng 1 yarn spindles. The total number of the above ten factories is one yarn spindles. Among them, Xinsheng Xieji,</p>
<p>Original Opening, Number of Spindles in Each Factory</p>
<p>All are Chinese capital. The original spindles of each factory that started operation before the war were: (1) Shenxin No. 2 Textile Factory 56,000 spindles, (2) Shenxin No. 9 Textile Factory 89,000 spindles, (3) Xinyu No. 1 Factory 25,000 spindles, (4) Xinyu No. 2 Factory 24,000 spindles, (5) Hongzhang 24,000 spindles, (6) Yong'an No. 3 Factory 63,000 spindles, (7) Datong Yarn Factory 4,700 spindles, (8) Tongyi Textile Factory 47,000 spindles, (9) Dongfeng Textile Factory 4,300 spindles, (10) Chongxin Textile Factory 34,000 spindles. The total number of the above ten factories is Chongxin Tongyi. Both are registered by British merchants, and Shenxin No. 2 Factory has been managed by American business enterprises.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Own All Yarn Factories in Shanghai</p>
<p>The Japanese-owned yarn factories in Shanghai that have started operations are: (1) Nihua Textile Factory No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, No. 6, No. 7, with a total of 174,816 spindles and 42,296 thread spindles. (1) The First to Ninth of Naigaimen Co., Ltd., with a total of 280,536 spindles, 111,880 thread spindles, and 3,800 looms. (3) Shanghai Textile Company No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, with a total of 119,024 spindles, 23,320 thread spindles, and 2,304 looms. (4) Tongxing Textile Company with 97,000 spindles, 20,240 thread spindles, and 1,412 looms. (5) Gongda Donghua Dakang Feng Shenyu Feng, with a total of 441,940 spindles, 8,200 thread spindles, and 7,000 looms.</p>
<p>British Ewo, Lun Chang Each Factory</p>
<p>The original factories in Shanghai owned by British merchants have now fully resumed operation. (1) Ewo Textile Company, Ewo Gongyi Yangshupu, with 40,976 yarn spindles and 2,135 looms. (2) Lun Chang Textile Dyeing and Printing Co., Ltd. with 3,640 thread spindles and 1,130 looms. The only factory that produces yarn is Gongyi, and the yarn it produces is not enough for the other three factories to weave cloth. They must purchase yarn from Chinese and Japanese yarn factories. As for Lun Chang Textile Company, it is heard that it has installed 44,000 spindles and is trying to expand in order to implement a self-spinning, self-weaving, and self-dyeing policy. However, the British yarn currently circulating on the market is the yarn produced by Chongxin, Tongyi, and the newly established Xinhe Anda factories.</p>
<p>Monopolizing Raw Materials, Ordering Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>Japan is using all its strength to collect cotton from the occupied areas of our country and transport it to Japan as raw materials for industry and military supplies. As a result, the amount of cotton exported to Japan has increased sharply. Last year, the value of cotton exports was 10,100,003,224 yuan in national currency. The value of cotton exports in the first quarter of this year was 3,527,021 yuan in national currency. Because cotton is monopolized by the Japanese, Shanghai yarn factories are in a state of panic due to lack of raw materials. They have no choice but to order foreign cotton from India, Egypt, the United States, Brazil, and other places to be transported to Shanghai to supplement their needs. The total value of cotton imports last year was 12,735,044 yuan. The value of cotton imports in the first quarter of this year has increased to 26,579,113 yuan.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Attempt to Monopolize the Yarn Industry</p>
<p>After the war, Shanghai has become the gathering place of Chinese and foreign yarn factories due to the sharp increase in the number of newly established yarn factories. Yarn prices in various places are based on the Shanghai market. However, the Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange is forced by the environment and has no hope of resuming auctions. However, Japanese merchants have organized a Cotton Industry Trading Exchange. The address is the old site of the Gold Industry Exchange on Er Ma Road. There is a saying that it will open on July 1. As for the sale of yarn, within the occupied areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hebei provinces, it has been monopolized by Japanese yarn, and Chinese yarn has almost disappeared. However, the sales areas of Chinese yarn are the six provinces of the West and the non-occupied areas. The sale of yarn in Shanghai City has also been plundered by Japanese yarn because the price of Japanese yarn is lower than that of Chinese yarn.</p>
<h3>US Navy Soldiers Go to Qinhuangdao</h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reported that ten officers and two hundred soldiers from the US Navy Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai are scheduled to board the American ship *Chaumont* on the 15th to go to Qinhuangdao for training. It is expected that they will return to Shanghai on the American ship *Henderson*.</p>
<h3>Appraisal Committee Suggests Purchasing Foreign Rice and Transporting it to Shanghai for Relief, and Requests Efforts to Dredge Inland Sources; Registration of Rice Stock Owners Began Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Rice Appraisal Committee, since its third committee meeting on the 9th of this month, resolved to suggest that the two concession authorities purchase foreign rice and transport it to Shanghai for relief, in order to maintain the food supply of Shanghai citizens. According to a report from a New Voice News Agency reporter, the text of the recommendation is as follows: Respected Sirs, Since the establishment of our committee, almost two months have passed. The achievements that can be mentioned include: Firstly, working with various rice industry organizations to stabilize rice prices; secondly, advising various trade associations to do their best to dredge sources; thirdly, investigating the amount of rice in storage and compiling statistics on a regular basis; and fourthly, recently handling the registration of rice stock owners, in order to</p>
<p>Benefit the People's Food Supply</p>
<p>We have done our best to do everything within our power. However, we ultimately feel that the results are not significant and the future is worrying. The reasons for this can be traced back to two points. Please allow me to elaborate. First, the purpose of the Appraisal Committee is to seek the equalization of rice prices. However, its organization is generated by various rice industry groups. With people from the industry in charge of this matter, no matter how loyal or fair they are, those outside who do not understand the true situation often criticize them. Although our committee does not hesitate to work hard and bear grievances, there are indeed inherent difficulties in reality. For example, the joint meeting of rice industry groups changed the price limit and strictly stipulated penalties, in order to stabilize the market price and prevent another surge. However, the owners have not accepted the advice to sell as much as possible, and the citizens have rushed to pre-purchase, resulting in a supply and demand mismatch and a chaotic market situation. Although our committee strives to stabilize the situation, it feels deeply troubled. Due to the lack of authority, there are few proper solutions. In the past, whenever rice was expensive, there were also price limits, which were</p>
<p>Initiated and Supervised by the Competent Authorities</p>
<p>The various rice industry groups were only in an assisting position, so people were more easily convinced and the price limit was not difficult to maintain. Now, times have changed and the situation is special. The various rice industry groups have overestimated their capabilities and organized our committee to serve society. However, for two months, we have exhausted our efforts. The future is long, and the future is worrying. There are indeed things that our committee cannot handle. The only remedy is to earnestly request your bureau to send personnel to participate and provide instructions at any time, so that the rice industry has something to follow and the market situation can be stabilized. Moreover, the stability of rice prices is directly related to the people's food supply and indirectly affects public security. We believe that your bureau will certainly agree to participate. Second, in order to seek the equalization of rice prices, price limits, investigations, registration, etc., are all stopgap measures. The fundamental solution lies in seeking an abundance of sources. If the sources are blocked and we only rely on existing rice stocks, even if we strictly stipulate price limits, it will be difficult to maintain without collapse. Under today's circumstances, if we want to enrich the sources, there are only two ways to go. One is to propose that your bureau follow the precedent of the previous year and order a large amount of foreign rice to be transported to Shanghai for storage, so that the people's food supply can be secured and rice prices can be easily suppressed. The second is to propose that your bureau find ways to dredge inland sources. The rice and grain of Jiangsu Province are concentrated in Wuxi, and the rice and grain of Anhui Province are concentrated in Wuhu. In the past, Shanghai's food supply, both indica and japonica, was largely obtained from these two places. Now, these two places have successively banned the transportation of rice and grain. The main reason for the recent scarcity of sources in Shanghai and the rise in market prices lies in this. Rice traders still have a small profit to be made and are doing their best to purchase and transport, but they are restricted by the situation and can only sigh helplessly. We can only</p>
<p>Rely on Your Bureau to Find Ways to Dredge</p>
<p>Be sure to ensure that a considerable amount of rice from Wuxi and Wuhu, the two major rice-producing areas, is transported to Shanghai every day or every month, continuously and uninterruptedly, so that the effect is equal to ordering foreign rice. We earnestly request your bureau to choose one of these two to implement, which is much better than various stopgap methods. The above is a request to participate in the organization of the Appraisal Committee and a request to order foreign rice or dredge inland sources, all of which are urgent matters at present. We earnestly pray that your bureau will approve our request and allow us to act accordingly. We express our urgent words and pray without end. Also,</p>
<p>Rice Stock Registration Began Yesterday</p>
<p>The deadline is one week, ending on the 18th. It is learned that the Rice Industry Association, Bean and Rice Industry Association, Rice Milling Industry, Rice Grain Sales Industry, and other trade associations in this city, as well as the Changshu Rice Association, Nanbang Rice Association, Shanghai North Rice Transporters United Association, and other rice industry groups, have all separately notified their affiliated industries to go directly to the Bean and Rice Industry Association at 5 Avenue Edward VII within the deadline to fill out the registration form. Otherwise, they will be reported to the concession authorities. Those who went to collect the form yesterday, the first day, were quite enthusiastic. As for the bean and rice market, after the price limit was strictly implemented, the market situation gradually stabilized, and four committee members were appointed to be responsible for assessing the price of early indica rice from the river every day before selling it again. Various trade associations are also doing their best to purchase from the producing areas and dredge sources in order to stabilize the food supply of Shanghai citizens. In addition to suggesting that the two concession authorities purchase foreign rice and transport it to Shanghai for relief, the Rice Appraisal Committee also plans to send another letter to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce today, requesting it to send personnel to participate in guidance.</p>
<h3>Dock Workers' Association Cables Request for Arrest of Wang Jingwei</h3>
<p>Daguang News Agency reports that the Dock Workers' Association of this city, because the traitor Jingwei and his gang rebelled against the country and sold out the nation, and recently ordered their henchmen to come to Shanghai to engage in activities, the whole country is deeply angry and resentful. They have specially telegraphed the National Government, requesting the arrest and punishment according to law. The original text is as follows: (Omitted titles) Wang Zhaoming previously made absurd remarks lightly. The central government was lenient and did not investigate. Recently, he has become even more intensified, not hesitating to betray the party and the country, sell out the nation, and lead the way for ×× to attack China. The people of the country are indignant and cannot tolerate him. All the workers of our association are clenching their fists and gnashing their teeth, vowing not to coexist with him. We earnestly request that an arrest warrant be issued quickly to purify party discipline and satisfy the people's hearts. (Omitted below)</p>
<h3>National Government Cables Relief Organizations to Assist Victims of Air Raids; Displaced People from Other Regions Should be Settled as Much as Possible Regardless of Boundaries; Relief Funds Allocated to this City Have Been Properly Distributed</h3>
<p>The National Government is extremely concerned about the people who have suffered disasters for the country. The situation is extremely serious in various important cities and towns that are frequently subjected to air raids and where victims are fleeing. In addition to the National Relief Commission engaging in relief work, it has recently telegraphed charitable organizations in various places, stating that they must find ways to accommodate displaced people from various places who have been forced to flee to other regions. Local organizations should, regardless of boundaries, try their best to settle them, in order to fulfill the obligations that citizens should fulfill. Various charitable organizations in this city have recently received this telegram. In addition, the Central Relief Commission has allocated 100,000 yuan per month for relief expenses in this city. The current allocation is temporarily 35,000 yuan for the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, 30,000 yuan for the Cilian Relief Association, 15,000 yuan for the Cilian Relief Branch, and 20,000 yuan for the Nanshi Refugee Area, totaling 100,000 yuan per month.</p>

<h3>What Will Happen to Shanghai After the Outbreak of the War? It Seems that it Will Transform into an Industrial City; Japan May Protect German and Italian Property; Speculation by Financial Commentator Allers</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Allers, a financial commentator in this city, wrote an article in the current issue of Millard's Review Weekly, titled "What Will Happen to Shanghai if the War Breaks Out?". It roughly states that if war occurs in Europe, with democratic countries and totalitarian countries on opposite sides, the result will be that Shanghai's foreign commerce will stagnate for a long time and suffer losses, but it will also stimulate the industrialists of this city.</p>
<p>After the Outbreak of the European War</p>
<p>Shanghai seems to be transforming into an industrial city. Also, after the war breaks out, Shanghai's shipping facilities will see a sudden shortage, as most foreign vessels will be requisitioned by their home countries. Other effects of the war include: (1) a decrease in goods imported to Shanghai from democratic countries, (2) a complete halt to goods imported to Shanghai from totalitarian countries, (3) rising prices, (4) a devaluation of European currencies, and finally a sharp drop in securities trading in this city and the announcement of</p>
<p>Postponement of Debt Repayment</p>
<p>Allers commented on the position of enemy countries in Shanghai, saying that although it is expected that Japan will expand its protection of German and Italian property here, it will generally remain neutral. At the same time, democratic countries here will not attempt to confiscate German and Italian commercial interests, fearing that</p>
<p>This Kind of Action</p>
<p>may give Japan a pretext for taking action against the International Settlement and the French Concession. Allers concluded by saying that Chinese capitalists have concentrated in Shanghai since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War and are eager to invest in profitable businesses, thereby promoting Shanghai's industrialization.</p>

<h3>Suixian, Hubei Province, Suffers Two Air Raids</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that information was received here yesterday (the 11th) that Suixian, Hubei Province, suffered air raids by Japanese planes on May 5th and 6th, resulting in about 100 deaths. Four-fifths of the remaining houses were either destroyed by bombs or set on fire by incendiary bombs. The British Methodist Church hospital was also hit by a bomb, which caused a 40-foot wall to collapse upon explosion. Patients, doctors, and nurses were fortunate enough to be sheltering in air-raid shelters, and there were no casualties. After the bombing, thousands of people immediately carried their belongings and retreated to the countryside, away from towns and roads. Since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the Suixian hospital is the thirty-eighth church hospital to be bombed. In March, three church hospitals in Xi'an, Zhengzhou, and Pingjiang were destroyed by Japanese planes. According to estimates from those involved in church medical work, the property loss of church hospitals has reached 1.5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Remnants of the Puppet Army Zhang Miaogen Unsuccessfully Attack Chenxing; Repelled by Fan's Troops Weng Tangming and Captured a Japanese Instructor, Murata</h3>
<p>Since Zhang Miaogen, the puppet self-defense force of Pudong, colluded with Xu Xingzhou a few weeks ago to attack Fan Gencai, the loyal and righteous army, Xu himself was captured on the spot by Fan's troops, and five-color flags and puppet self-defense force armbands, etc., were seized. Fan's troops sent Xu and the seized items to Ding Xueshan's headquarters for interrogation. At this time, Wang, the battalion commander of Xu's troops, upon receiving the news, colluded with Zhang Miaogen, the traitor, and detained Fan Gencai's elderly mother as collateral. Wang of Xu's troops came to Shanghai and secretly discussed a retaliatory plan with Zhou, a person in charge in Shanghai County. Under Zhou's instigation, it was decided to collude with Zhang Miaogen again last night (the 10th) to attack Fan's troops. Weng Tangming of the reserve brigade under Fan's command, upon receiving the news, reported to Fan and personally led the brigade to launch a head-on attack. They encountered each other in the western suburbs of Chenxing, Pudong, and a fierce battle ensued throughout the night. The gunfire was dense, and the situation was serious. Both sides engaged in repeated hand-to-hand combat for as long as four hours. The Japanese puppet troops were defeated and routed. They captured a Japanese military instructor, Murata, and seized more than 100 rifles and two light and heavy machine guns, killing more than 80 puppet soldiers.</p>

<p>According to shipping news, a Japanese warship arrived off Longshan, Zhenhai, on the 10th and is currently moored at Qilishizhou without any unusual movements. As for Ningbo, which was bombed for the sixth time on the 10th, the area where the most bombs were dropped was the Ningchuan Automobile Company garage on Dahe Road, Jiangdong, with as many as twelve bombs dropped, resulting in heavy losses, which can be imagined. However, the materials and tools in the garage had already been moved out, and only the garage building was destroyed. Although other bombs landed in bustling areas, because residents had been evacuated early and most business hours had been changed to night markets, the casualties were very minor. Although Ningbo has suffered six bombings, all local administration is still proceeding as usual, and order is gradually being restored.</p>
<h3>Slaughterhouses in the Two Concessions Will Stop Slaughtering Pigs Starting Tomorrow Morning; All Butcher Shops Have Unanimously Decided Not to Sell; Pork Will Disappear After the 15th</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Fresh Pork Industry Association declared its position and vowed not to participate in illegal organizations, the fresh pork that came to Shanghai was detained and looted by the "Livestock Market," resulting in a scarcity of fresh pork sources, which affected the entire Shanghai meat supply. After the fresh meat industry and the slaughterhouses decided not to sell or slaughter from today, reporters from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from the fresh meat industry and the slaughterhouses yesterday that: (1) The slaughterhouses in Suzhou, Wuxi, Ninghai, and other places, as well as the slaughterhouse in the French Concession, have decided to stop slaughtering pigs starting tomorrow (the 14th) morning.

<h3>Florence Nightingale, Founder of Nursing, Birth Anniversary; Hospitals and Nursing Organizations Held Commemorative Ceremonies</h3>
<p>Yesterday was World Hospital Day, and also the anniversary of the birth of Florence Nightingale, the founder of nursing.

Ms. Nightingale was saddened by this and united with female comrades to cross the sea to carry out on-site rescue work, experiencing all kinds of hardships. She also fell ill. Some people advised her to return home, but Ms. Nightingale did not listen and continued to work as usual. After the war ended, inspired by Ms. Nightingale's enthusiasm, various countries established the Red Cross Society, dedicated to rescue and other charitable undertakings.</p>

<h3>Miss ×× Exceptionally Intelligent, Only Due to a Difference in Thought with Her Sister, Almost Led to a Quarrel!</h3>
<p>Miss ×× is exceptionally thoughtful. Every night, she reviews books and newspapers and studies her lessons. She must sleep on the Double Horse Peach Wood Bed or the Singapore Spring Bed exclusively sold by the Siemens Bed Factory on Avenue Edward VII. Because its springs are comfortable and there is no problem of bedbugs infesting it, she can concentrate on her studies and strive for progress. She always ranks among the top in school exams and has both fame and fortune. Her sister ×× is not like this. Although she is virtuous, her thinking is old-fashioned. She still uses the old-fashioned iron bed, and bedbugs are infested in it, which cannot be cleaned up. Therefore, although the weather has not been very hot recently, she has already been plagued by bedbugs and cannot sleep well every night, suffering unspeakable pain. Her sister is now also advising her to change to a peach wood bed. Looking at this situation, just because of a difference in thought, the difference in material enjoyment is so great that it cannot but be regretted. Therefore, today, people of insight are happy to use products from Siemens Bed Factory.</p>
<p>The two Hebei traffickers who were escorting the opium, a Japanese on board, and the captain, chief engineer, and sailor of the small boat are all detained in the Japanese Gendarmerie Water Branch at the Floating Hotel. The small boat that transported the opium has no Chinese name and it is unknown to which company it belongs. It is still detained by the puppet "Water Police Team." It is heard that because the boat flew the Japanese flag, the inside story is complicated. It is believed that the Japanese authorities will thoroughly investigate it.</p>
<h3>Sir Victor Sassoon Appeals for Jews; Receives Reporters, Saying Another 20,000 Jews Are Coming to Shanghai; Hopes All Parties Will Assist So That They Can Find Shelter</h3>
<p>——Silberman Goes to England, America, and France for Aid——</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that Sir Victor Sassoon received newspaper reporters yesterday (the 11th) afternoon for a discussion lasting two hours. He stated that 800 Jewish refugees are scheduled to arrive here on Sunday, and another 1,295 are scheduled to arrive within the month. If a place is not found for them to live, they will be forced to sleep on the streets. The shelters are already full of refugees. Given that it is expected that another 20,000 people will come to Shanghai before the end of the year, we do not know how to deal with this problem.</p>
<p>Sassoon Appeals</p>
<p>to foreigners in Shanghai to help find housing to accommodate these refugees. He stated that the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation has handed over its Hongkou branch building to the committee for allocation, which will accommodate 150 to 200 people. Currently, the shelters accommodate 1,000 people, and the daily cost of providing food for 4,800 people is 33 cents per person. Although the price is cheap,</p>
<p>The Food is Still Plentiful</p>
<p>However, it may lack certain vitamins. As for the kitchens, the one in the Riverside Apartments can be taken as an example. That kitchen can provide food for 600 to 1,300 people every day. Sassoon mentioned economic issues, saying that everything is done according to a monthly budget of 90,000 yuan. This amount is sent regularly from London, New York, and Egypt. Other</p>
<p>Donations from Various Places</p>
<p>can amount to 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. To date, 7,219 refugees arriving in Shanghai have registered with the committee, but there are probably 800 independent people who have not registered. A few months ago, the committee established a special fund to help refugees do business. Now there are about 200 people who have established shops as a result, and have enabled another 500 refugees to work. Before refugees apply for loans to do business, the committee must conduct a</p>
<p>Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Now some people have completely repaid their loans, and some are repaying part of them on schedule, so that the committee can help other refugees. The shops established by the refugees do not hinder other long-established shops. On the contrary, competition can enable the original shops to improve their goods, and these shops employ many Chinese laborers, which really helps to alleviate the</p>
<p>Unemployment Problem</p>
<p>in this city. Sassoon also mentioned the refugee housing problem, saying that the committee has obtained 240 mu of land in Yangshupu and is currently studying the possibility of building a shelter there. Sassoon then appealed to the Japanese authorities, hoping that the Japanese authorities would allocate one or several houses that are currently occupied for military purposes to the committee for allocation. There is nothing else to ask for. Those who are about to arrive must be given shelter. It is hoped that all parties will help with this</p>
<p>Difficult Work</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that Mr. Silberman, Chairman of the Shanghai Jewish Refugee Committee, is scheduled to travel to the United States by ship on Sunday morning, and then to England and France, to discuss the Jewish refugee problem here. This trip will last approximately six months. Although he is not traveling as a dedicated representative of Shanghai refugees, he will take this vacation to personally appeal to all sectors overseas for assistance. Silberman will</p>
<p>First Go to New York</p>
<p>to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, then to Paris to visit the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, and then to England to the London German Jewish Advisory Committee to present the difficulties in dealing with the refugee problem in Shanghai, and to discuss the situation in this city with these three major world aid centers for refugees.</p>

<h3>Chief of Receiving and Dispatching at the Great Northern Telegraph Company, Pan Chengjing, Assassinated Yesterday - Killed in Front of the YMCA on Avenue Edward VII, Succumbing to Three Knife Wounds; Perpetrator Apprehended</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 5:00 PM, in front of the Chinese YMCA at 123 Avenue du Maréchal Joffre in the French Concession, a man in a Western suit, approximately forty years old, was violently stabbed three times by a man dressed in a blue long robe. Two of the wounds were to the chest, and one to the neck. Blood gushed forth immediately. The assailant, seeing that his objective was achieved, fled eastward towards the vegetable market. However, the stabbed man, despite his severe injuries, managed to struggle and give chase. When the pursuit reached the intersection of Rue de l'Arbre-Sec and Route Paul Henry, the assailant was about to turn south when he was intercepted by Chinese Constable No. 961 in front of the Da Dong Lai Nanyang Goods Store at the corner. The constable seized the murder weapon and several flyers. At this time, the stabbed man had arrived, but due to his injuries and exhaustion, he immediately collapsed in front of Da Dong Lai. Constable No. 961 immediately reported to the police station. The police chief dispatched both Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the scene for investigation. It was found that the murdered man was named Pan Chengjing, courtesy name Muzhong, 45 years old, from Suzhou, residing at No. 16 Datongfang on Route Mgr. Maresca in the French Concession. He was currently the chief of receiving and dispatching at the Great Northern Telegraph Company at 34 Avenue Edward VII. The assailant was named Wang Chenggong, 21 years old, from Shandong. After the detectives completed their investigation, Pan was taken to the Hopital Sainte Marie on Route du Père Robert by car. However, due to excessive blood loss and the severity of the wounds, he died in the hospital at 9:35 PM. The hospital notified the police station to report to the court for an autopsy. The apprehended assailant is currently under strict interrogation by the police.</p>

<h3>Husband Leaves Home, Wife Becomes Pregnant - Husband Accuses, Wife Hangs Herself in Shame - Wife's Family Demolishes House and Sets It on Fire to Vent Anger</h3>
<p>Gu Miaofu, a local resident of Wangjiazhai in Pudong, 29 years old, made a living by rowing a boat. His wife, Xie Jinmei, of the same age as Gu, had marital discord with Gu after their marriage. Gu took a concubine outside and lived with her on the boat. He abandoned Xie for eight years, treating her as if she were discarded. Recently, Gu learned that Xie was pregnant for seven or eight months, with a large belly, and would soon give birth. Therefore, he believed that she was having an affair without any doubt. Feeling that it damaged his reputation, he returned home the day before yesterday (the 11th) to interrogate her and called Xie's family to judge and agree on a divorce. The two sides argued without reaching an agreement and broke up unhappily. Unexpectedly, at 3:00 PM that day, it was discovered that Xie, due to shame and anger, had hanged herself in the room and died. Soon after, Xie's family, upon hearing the news, gathered dozens of women and went to Gu's house to demand justice. Gu had already gone to work on the boat and was not at home. They completely destroyed the stove, pots, pans, doors, windows, walls, and miscellaneous items in the house. They also tore down the roof and moved the bed, chest, dressing table, wardrobe, and other furniture from the bedroom, piled them up on the open space, and set them on fire. They also reported to the local Japanese military police. Unable to arrest Gu Miaofu, they arrested five neighbors. After the case occurred, it caused a sensation throughout Pudong. Yesterday, hundreds of people went to watch. The deceased's body remained on the bed until last night, and no one had yet collected it.</p>
<h3>Plot to Harm a Monk - Five Years and Six Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Zhao Kong (34 years old), a monk from Taizhou residing at Fuguo Temple at 4725 Route Robert, harbored resentment towards Kong Ci, a fellow monk from the same hometown, because he failed to obtain a loan of 80 yuan. On the afternoon of the 12th of this month, he secretly took a glass tube of oxalic acid, a poisonous powder left behind by a surgeon named Meng who had practiced medicine at the temple before returning to Taizhou, and poured it into the bottle of yellow wine that Kong Ci drank every night before going to bed, attempting to murder him. The case was discovered and reported to the Putuo Road police station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Zhao Kong and sent him to the First Special District Court. The details of his confession have been reported in this newspaper.

<h3>Drug Trafficker Wang Tianxin - Appeals Against Conviction - Joint Hearing Held Yesterday, Verdict to be Announced on the 18th</h3>
<p>Wang Tianxin, from Haimen, opened a toy factory named Xie Xinlong Gong Ji with partners on Qiujiang Road in Zhabei before the August 13th Incident. The business was quite good, and he had accumulated some savings. However, after the factory was destroyed by artillery fire, he lost his job and sought another way out. He believed that the most profitable business in recent years was drug trafficking. Wang and his wife lived at No. 4, Lane 45, Qingdao Road, while his mistress, Shen, lived at No. 33 of the same lane.</p>
<p>To maintain</p>
<p>the secrecy of his drug trafficking, all kinds of drugs such as heroin and morphine were hidden in Shen's residence. If a buyer wanted to purchase drugs, they had to first pay the price at No. 4 and then be led to No. 33 to pick up the goods. He only sold in bulk and not retail. Therefore, he had never been exposed since he started trafficking. The money he earned was also considerable. It was not until March of this year that Detective Ye Rong of the New Zhabei Police Station heard about it and sent someone with 5 yuan in legal tender to purchase drugs at No. 4. Wang initially refused because the amount was too small, but the person cunningly said that what he was buying was only a sample. If the</p>
<p>tested goods</p>
<p>were good, he would continue to purchase in large quantities. Wang then sold the drugs. The next day, Deputy Detective Ye led Chinese and Western detectives to Shen's bedroom at No. 33 and searched it. They found a total of 124 taels of heroin and 24 taels of morphine, estimated to be worth over 10,000 yuan, and confiscated over 1,500 yuan in cash obtained from drug sales and drug trafficking records. They then went to No. 4 and arrested Wang Tianxin and Shen, and handed them over to the First Special District Court. The initial trial concluded, and Wang was sentenced to</p>
<p>life imprisonment</p>
<p>while Shen was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment. The drugs and proceeds from drug sales were confiscated. However, the drug trafficker still hoped to escape punishment and filed an appeal with the High Court Second Branch, strongly arguing that the drugs were deposited by Gu Weicheng and did not belong to him. He requested the revocation of the original verdict and the return of the confiscated funds. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu opened a joint hearing and ordered the two men and women to be brought to court to question them about the reasons for the appeal. Shen only claimed that the goods were deposited by Gu and that she had only recently come to Shanghai from the countryside and did not know that the deposited items were drugs. Wang Tianxin simply denied everything. Judge Yu then reviewed the entire case file and concluded that the defendant's</p>
<p>statements were contradictory</p>
<p>and full of evasions and denials. He immediately ordered the start of the debate. Police lawyer Gan Jingxian first stated that the defendant's drug trafficking facts were supported by sufficient physical evidence and that his crime was undeniable. He requested that the appeal be rejected and that he be punished according to law. Then, the lawyers for Wang and his mistress, Fan Gang, Yu Enliang, and Qiu Peng, successively presented their defense. Finally, Prosecutor Lin rose to speak, and after the arguments, the court ordered that the verdict be announced on the afternoon of the 18th of this month. Wang Tianxin and Shen were returned to custody.</p>

It is reported that at around 4:00 PM that afternoon, Lu was riding in his private car with a black license plate, No. 4-1-2, from the "Bureau" back to his residence on Route Frelupt. The car was driven by the chauffeur, Kong Caifu. However, after Lu returned to his residence, due to other important matters, he specially sent Liu Xiangyun, who accompanied Lu, to the Zhabei police station to discuss matters, and still ordered Kong to drive there. Just as they turned from Route Frelupt onto Jiangwan Road, they saw a Japanese military train approaching from Wusong back to Shanghai. Although Kong saw the train coming at this time, he still wanted to cross the tracks and accelerated forward. Unexpectedly, the speed of the train was also very fast, causing it to violently collide with the car. With a loud bang, the car flipped over. Fortunately, it was thrown a dozen feet away. However, Liu, who was sitting next to the driver, was severely injured by the car's glass and metal fragments. Almost his entire face was disfigured, and he immediately lost consciousness. Kong Caifu, the driver, was also barely breathing. The sentries from the Japanese Navy stationed on Jiangwan Road heard about it and dragged the injured Liu and Kong out of the car. They urgently called an ambulance and sent them to Fumin Hospital for treatment. After the hospital doctors administered several strong heart injections, they were rescued. They are still unconscious and their lives are in danger. Kong's injuries are slightly lighter, but his treatment will also take quite some time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Reconnoiter at Low Altitude</h3>
<p>In the area above Hongqiao Road, Zhongshan Road, and Xietu Road in the Western District of Shanghai, Japanese planes, one or two at a time, have frequently been spotted flying low to conduct reconnaissance or circling up and down, as if practicing. Yesterday morning, another Japanese plane flew back and forth in the skies above the Western District of Shanghai, making a constant buzzing sound. It left and returned several times in about an hour. At around 2:00 PM, three twin-engine bombers chased each other back and forth in the skies above Longhua and Caohejing, flying up and down and circling several times before flying towards the southwest. Considering the fierce battles between Chinese and Japanese forces in Punan in recent days, the deployment of Japanese planes may be to reconnoiter the movements of the Chinese army.</p>

<h3>Why Involve in Lawsuits Over Family Matters? - Father Sues Widow Daughter-in-Law to Return Home - Court Advises Both Parties to Reconcile to Avoid Hurting Feelings</h3>
<p>Dong Diqing, 56 years old, from Haimen, Jiangsu, currently residing at No. 8 Rongheli, Route Haig, in the Western District of Shanghai, retained lawyer Shi Lin to file a lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special District against his widowed daughter-in-law, Dong Wang Zhenglan (29 years old), and her son, Dong Yonglin (8 years old), residing with her mother's family at No. 9 Weileyuan, Route Haig, seeking their return home to live together. According to the plaintiff's statement, the plaintiff's eldest son, Dong Shiquan, married the first defendant and had a son, the second defendant. Unfortunately, Shiquan died of illness on the sixth day of the eighth month of the 23rd year of the Republic. The plaintiff treated the defendant and her son with</p>
<p>great care.</p>
<p>This time, due to the disaster, they came to Shanghai together and lived in one place. Unexpectedly, six months ago, the first defendant took her son, the second defendant, back to her mother's family in Ning and never returned. He repeatedly sent people to pick them up, but they ignored him. However, the second defendant is of school age, and the plaintiff has already paid the tuition. Because they were taken away by the defendant, he cannot attend school. He has no choice but to sue, requesting that the defendants be ordered to return home and live together. Upon receiving the statement, the court, yesterday afternoon, through Judge Chen, opened the Seventh Civil Court to summon the plaintiff Dong Diqing and his attorney.</p>
<p>To state the previous circumstances.</p>
<p>The defendants Dong Wang Zhenglan and Dong Yonglin, mother and son, commissioned lawyer Zhao Xunsu to appear in court, stating that it is very common for the first defendant to take her son to live with her mother's family. According to the first defendant, Dong Wang Zhenglan, she told this lawyer that she married the plaintiff's eldest son, Dong Baoquan, in the 18th year of the Republic and had a son named Yonglin, the second defendant. Unfortunately, her husband passed away in the 21nd year of the Republic. The defendant vowed to raise her son alone, but her parents-in-law showed no love or care. They did not care about the defendant's medical expenses or the child's expenses.</p>
<p>Did not take care of them</p>
<p>While they took very good care of their other younger sons, etc. When the war broke out and the countryside fell, the plaintiff led his family to Shanghai to take refuge, abandoning the defendant and her son. Because the defendant could not live in the countryside, she took her son to live with her mother's family. For the child's education, she has already hired a Mr. Zhang Zhifang to teach him. Now the defendant is not absolutely unwilling to go home, but the plaintiff cannot order the defendant to</p>
<p>Absolutely Not Allowed</p>
<p>to go to her mother's family. At this point, the court advised the plaintiff that this case is a very small matter between families. Why involve the courts and meet in court? It is better to ask someone to persuade them to avoid hurting feelings. Moreover, if this case goes through trial, the family's feelings will become even worse in the future. The court then instructed the lawyers of both parties to go outside and persuade both parties to reconcile. The case was adjourned for another hearing.</p>

<h3>Cao Jiazhen Kidnapping Case - Original Verdict Upheld on Appeal</h3>
<p>(Shanghai Guangshe) Cao Jiazhen, an employee of the Datong Company on Jiangxi Road and a native of Shaoxing, was kidnapped by his classmate Lin Xucen on the 2nd of last month, intending to demand a ransom of 10,000 yuan. The case was solved by the French Concession police, and the kidnapped victim was rescued.

<h3>Jewish Refugees Stealing Watches - Father and Son Both Imprisoned</h3>
<p>Germany has now become the chopping block of Europe. In recent years, the weak and small ethnic groups in that country, those without the will to resist, have mostly been slaughtered. The Jews are even more incompatible there, wandering around like homeless dogs. In recent months, the Jewish refugees who have come to Shanghai have been fortunate enough to be properly accommodated by the concession authorities. Many of them are happy to be home. However, there are also good and bad among them. Some of the bad ones, because they have no worries about food and lodging, have developed unreasonable ideas. A man named Hengsheng, together with his son, sneaked out of the reception center the other day and mingled with people at a certain watch company, stealing watches. They were discovered and reported to the police and arrested. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special Court for questioning, and it was confirmed that the charges were true. The father was sentenced to two months of imprisonment, and the son was sentenced to twice as much. The father and son both pleaded guilty in court and immediately exchanged their wandering lives for the taste of iron bars.</p>
<h3>6,000 Squatters on Canongate Road Request to Stop Forced Eviction - Otherwise, Allow Time to Compensate for Losses</h3>
<p>The vacant land with deed No. 533 in the British Registry on Canongate Road in the Public Settlement belongs to the Yiyuan Qianzhuang. After the war, more than 6,000 refugees from Yangshupu built straw sheds to live there, totaling 500 rooms. In January of this year, the owner requested the court to mediate because he wanted to build houses, ordering a quarter of the straw sheds, more than 130 households, to move out. Last month, he ordered the remaining straw sheds to be demolished. The squatters, Chen Derong, Zhu Zheng, Wang Adu, Zhu Zhenglin, Yuan Dexi, and others, petitioned the court for mediation. Because the owner did not appear, mediation failed. Now, in addition to jointly petitioning the Citizen's Association of the First Special District, the Refugee Relief Association, the International Relief Association, etc., for assistance, they have also asked lawyer Zhang Zuo Liu to file a statement with the First Special District Court, requesting that the owner be stopped from forcing the eviction to avoid becoming refugees. He also asked for a preliminary injunction and referred to the Municipal Council's previous order to force the Salt Mountain Road squatters to move, which also had a two-month deadline and a subsidy of 14 yuan per household for losses, saying that if the owner must force the eviction, he should also allow time to compensate for the losses.</p>

<h3>Women's Agent Sues for Child Confirmation: Concubine Ousted After Master's Death</h3>
<p>Li Jinfeng, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 2, Sanyu Lane, at the intersection of La Fayette Road and the vegetable market in the French Concession, is thirty-seven years old this year. Ten years ago, she cohabited with Chen Lansheng, an elderly Jiangxi man who opened the Lanji Tobacco Shop in the South City, and had five children with him: the eldest, Damao, is nine years old; the second, Ermao, is eight years old; the third, Maomao, is eight years old (these two are twins); the fourth, Xiaomao, is four years old; and the fifth, Meimei, is two years old. Unfortunately, Chen Lansheng passed away from illness in his own residence (No. 281, Route Edouard VII, west of Zhengjia Wood Bridge) in December of last year. Li Jinfeng learned of this and took her children to mourn, but was rejected by Chen's eldest son, Chen Weixian (also known as Weigong), and his son, Chen Weishan. They were also excluded from inheritance. Therefore, Li Jinfeng, acting as the legal representative, along with her children, retained lawyers Jiang Yiping, Li Gengxiang, Yang Yunshi, and Ge Bangren, and filed a lawsuit with the Civil Division of the Second Special Court against Chen Weixian, Chen Weishan, and others to confirm that Li Damao and his siblings are Chen Lansheng's biological children. The court, upon receiving the petition, held a hearing yesterday morning presided over by Judge Li Liang. First, the plaintiff's lawyer presented the case and submitted photographs. The defendants also retained a lawyer, who argued that the plaintiffs should file a paternity suit against Chen Lansheng himself, not against the defendants, as there was an error in the subject of the lawsuit. Furthermore, the Civil Code stipulates that confirmation of illegitimate children is only valid within five years, and the statute of limitations has now expired. Moreover, Chen Lansheng and the plaintiff only had a romantic relationship and cannot be considered family members. According to the law, there must be permanent cohabitation to be considered family members. The defendants requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The court examined the situation and adjourned the hearing to the 23rd for further inquiry.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Dear Editor, With respect, I am writing regarding the "Young Men and Women Commit Suicide by Taking Poison in a Closed Room" event published in your newspaper on May 12. It stated, "Afterwards, it was learned that the woman was surnamed Fan, from Wuxi, and her brother was a clerk in the Wangfu Nail Factory on Yichang Road." I have worked in the Wangfu Nail Factory for many years, and I am the only one with the surname Fan. Moreover, my sister has been married for many years, with a deep love between husband and wife, and has children. How can there be such unfounded words? The person with the surname Fan may be someone else. Your newspaper has published an error, so I am writing to request a correction. With best wishes, Fan Yichen, May 12.</p>

<h3>Liuzhou, Guangxi Promotes Adult Education: Eliminating 18,000 Illiterate People This Year, Emphasizing Adult Education for Women</h3>
<p>(Guilin Correspondence) Liujiang is a rather important county among the nineteen counties in Guangxi. The total area of the county is 7,182 square miles, divided into five towns, thirty townships, 429 villages and streets, and a population of more than 238,800 people. Among them, there are 18,767 adults who have dropped out of school (according to the statistics of March 27th). After the Liujiang County Government was ordered to carry out adult education, it decided on the following seven measures:</p>
<p>Establish a Promotion Committee</p>
<p>(1) Establish a committee to promote adult education. The committee was officially established on the first of this month, and is specifically responsible for promoting adult education, with the aim of eliminating illiteracy, popularizing mass education, strengthening mass mobilization, and giving full play to the power of the War of Resistance and National Reconstruction within this year. (2) Publicity: The importance of adult education will be vigorously publicized by village and street chiefs, school teachers, and enthusiastic educationists at village and street people's congresses or other gatherings. The Liuzhou Daily has published a "Special Issue on Adult Education" to expand publicity and encourage the masses to actively participate.</p>
<p>Training Adult Education Teachers</p>
<p>(3) Teacher Training: There are 420 villages and streets in the county. Each village and street must have one full-time adult education teacher, requiring a total of 429 adult education teachers. Furthermore, because this year's adult education is different from the narrow literacy movement and remedial education of the past, it is necessary to establish a teacher training class for all teachers for short-term training. In the first phase, in addition to separately drawing teachers from primary schools in various townships for training, an examination system will be implemented to select real talent. A total of more than 160 teachers will be trained in this phase. The class has already started, and after ten days of training, they will be sent to various townships, villages, and streets to take on adult education work. (4) Establish Adult Education Classes: There are 429 villages and streets in the county. Each village and street is expected to establish one or two adult classes, with one full-time teacher, who will be given a monthly living allowance of 10 yuan in national currency. After the completion of the two classes, an additional 5 yuan in national currency will be subsidized. The enrollment is stipulated to be at least 30 people per class and not more than 60 people. (5) Establish Demonstration Adult Classes: This is stipulated in Article 8 of the adult education program in this province. Each county should use special secondary schools or central schools with excellent grades to organize demonstration adult classes. The county has now decided that the Liuzhou Provincial Junior High School and the Private Longcheng Junior High School will each establish a demonstration adult class to serve as a demonstration for other schools.</p>
<p>Promoting Prostitute Education</p>
<p>(6) Promote Adult Education for Prostitutes: Recently, there have been reports of prostitutes saving the country, so it is necessary to promote education for them and increase their belief in resisting the enemy. There are currently 133 prostitutes in Liuzhou Special District. It is planned to divide them into three classes and send personnel to teach them. (7) Performance Evaluation: In each village and street, all out-of-school adults, both men and women, who are at least 18 years old and under 15 years old, should attend classes for two hours a day without hindering their daily work (men and women will be taught in separate classes). They will graduate in two months. After graduation, the government will issue graduation certificates. The required textbooks will be provided by the government. Those who graduate with excellent results will be selected by the county government, from five to twenty people, and given bonuses or certificates to encourage them at the end of this year's adult class. Those who refuse to enroll or who are not effectively supervised will be punished according to the provincial regulations. According to the above steps, the county government urges the various townships, the townships urge the various villages and streets, and the villages and streets persuade the people to enroll actively.

<h3>Aurora University Cultivates Construction Talents: Sino-French Cooperation to Develop the Southwest</h3>
<p>Aurora University is the oldest and most famous institution of higher learning among the private universities in this city. This year, because other universities have moved to the interior or had to temporarily suspend classes due to the fall of school buildings into the war zone, Aurora University has been able to maintain its pre-war status in the current environment. Therefore, students who register for admission to the school have flocked to it. According to the school authorities, since the Chinese government and France jointly invested in the development of the southwest, the school has repeatedly been entrusted by the responsible authorities in the area to find specialized technical talents. The students who are about to graduate this semester have all been hired. However, the southwestern provinces still need engineers and economic specialists, and there is a great demand for them. The reason is that the various enterprises in Sino-French cooperation, such as railway bureaus, banks, factories, etc., need personnel who are proficient in French. In the past, Chinese students believed that French could only be used in diplomacy and politics, so there were not many scholars. Now, they are aware of the needs of the emerging construction industry in the southwest, and the number of new students enrolling in Aurora and studying engineering and economics has increased compared with previous years, which can be said to be a good phenomenon in China's War of Resistance and National Reconstruction.</p>

<h3>Dog Administration in the Shanghai International Settlement (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Chen Bintang</p>
<p>Regarding this issue, we can consider it from three aspects:</p>
<p>The International Settlement's handling of stray dogs and an overview of the finances obtained from dogs.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Society for the Protection of Animals and Dogs.</p>
<p>The facilities of the Shanghai International Settlement for the treatment of rabid dogs.</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the International Settlement's handling of stray dogs, it can be described as follows: The Settlement authorities, recognizing that ownerless street dogs could cause the most dangerous rabies within the Settlement, dispatched two dog-catching vehicles from the police every day to patrol the roads. All dogs without muzzles or licenses were subject to being caught and taken directly to the dog prison with sixty-eight rooms at the Gordon Road police station (a dog prison was also set up in the Yangshupu police station, but it is currently unavailable due to the war). After ten days, if the dog was unclaimed, the police would find a new owner for the dog (dog fee five yuan, license five and a half yuan) or suffocate it. In the past, the suffocated dogs were often bought and eaten by nearby villagers, but this was discovered by the police, and the purchase was prohibited. Therefore, the Public Works Department sold the dog skins to designated merchants and prepared machines to refine dog oil to make raw materials for white one. Any dog suspected of having rabies was sent by the police to the examination prison (Observation Kennel) in Hongkou (Sawgin Rd.) (temporarily handled by the Gordon Road police station during this war) (see attached table three). If there were no rabies symptoms after more than twenty days, it would be returned to the original owner. If rabies was confirmed, it would be burned. As for the dog prison on Gordon Road, there were sixty-eight confinement rooms in total. Because of the narrowness of the prison, it was only suitable for dogs and cats, and other large animals, such as horses, were not included. The number of dogs suffocated each year due to being unclaimed numbered in the thousands (see attached table two). Its income must be considerable. As for the license price, there has always been a regulation that each one is sold for five yuan and fifty cents, regardless of size or type. The average number of licenses issued each year is around two to three thousand, with an average income of around ten thousand. As for the department's expenses, such as dog food and staff salaries, there is an annual surplus.</p>
<p>(A) History—The society was founded in 1904. At that time, the Public Works Department, with the power of the Mixed Court, was able to list the protection of livestock as one of the conditions for donation certificates. Therefore, livestock owners who violated the conditions for protecting livestock were fined by the Mixed Court. These fines were used as part of the society's expenses. However, since the abolition of the Mixed Court, and there are no explicit provisions in Chinese law for the protection of livestock, the enforcement of fines and so on gradually became difficult, and the interest of all parties in the society gradually decreased. At one point, there were only twenty members and only one clerk. The economic pressure on the society at that time can be said to have been extreme. It had no fixed office address and lacked annual reports. It maintained this situation for many years until the January 28th Incident in Shanghai in 1932. The society resumed operations in response to social needs. At that time, the Public Works Department was not only doing its best to help refugees, but also engaged in the rescue of livestock. However, due to limited manpower, it was difficult to take care of everything. Therefore, the society reorganized in the midst of calls for relief. After more than a year, the society's affairs increased day by day. Therefore, temporary secretaries and other staff members were also restored as usual, and annual reports were also printed as before. Since then, its membership has jumped from twenty to eight hundred. The speed of progress is truly admirable. Not only have inspectors from various markets resumed their duties one after another, but a "Blue Cross Annual" was also started to be printed in 1936.</p>
<p>(B) Purpose and Procedures for Joining—The purpose of the society is to reduce the suffering of livestock and to find methods of protection within the realm of possibility. On the one hand, the society specially seeks the efforts of various staff members and people from all walks of life to persuade, as well as the assistance of the authorities' laws. However, general education is still being considered. As for the procedures for joining the society, they are very simple. The society's members have no nationality restrictions, nor is there a distinction between men and women. The annual membership fee is five yuan in national currency, and permanent membership is twenty yuan, with a free "Blue Cross Annual" (published monthly this year). The society is currently working hard to become internationalized, with staff members from at least fifteen countries.</p>
<p>(C) A Glimpse of the Work Situation (1) Due to the nature of the work, there are difficulties in making public everywhere regarding social improvement, for fear of hindering future cooperation with all sectors of society. However, very common work, such as the protection of animals during transportation, can be briefly described. The society sends several inspectors to stations or docks to inspect the livestock being transported. If it is not sufficiently safe, for example, the rope for leading cattle should not be tied to the nose but to the horns. Also, at the McGon Road station, at the request of the society, the station installed a water tank for livestock to quench their thirst. Furthermore, when trucks carrying pigs are overloaded, they must be fined. The above, and so on, have been greatly effective under the efforts of the inspectors.</p>
<p>(2) Handling of Ownerless Street Dogs—All ownerless street dogs or sick dogs that have been captured by the society are treated by the society's veterinarian. If the condition is serious and the doctor believes that treatment is unnecessary, they will be suffocated (a total of 2,278 heads since 1932). Other street dogs will be found new owners by the society. Those who have not found new owners after a long time will be treated the same as seriously ill dogs. In addition to their duties of patrolling, the inspectors also go to various hospitals to participate in the inspection of various animals. All those related to animal life will do their best to submit for research.</p>
<p>(3) Educational Publicity—Recognizing the importance of education in protecting livestock, the society often goes to various schools to distribute badges and advertisements. In 1933, there was an inter-school essay competition on livestock protection. In 1935, there was also a poster competition for young children. At that time, thanks to the cooperation of various social groups, as many as 700 Chinese schools participated in the competition. The results can be imagined. In the future, all kinds of preventive and educational work will be carried out in schools. If the economy is abundant, prizes will be prepared to encourage them.</p>
<p>(D) The Society's Hopes for the Future (A) The Enactment of Chinese Livestock Protection Laws—To this day, our country's laws have not yet finalized a "Humanitarian Law." Therefore, the society's work is greatly hindered. If the law cannot provide adequate assistance and strength, what will be the impact on social morality? What should be the progress of a country's culture? For example, if a person violently cuts off a cat's head or beats a dog to death, they are not guilty because there are no legal provisions. If all of these are not stopped, the abuses in the future will be unimaginable. Therefore, the society is now working hard to ensure that Chinese regulations also have provisions for livestock protection. (According to the Buddhist Association of our country, before the August 13th Incident, a livestock protection society was also initiated, and a life release center was established in Dachang. At that time, the two societies cooperated with each other. Later, after the August 13th Incident, the life release center in Dachang was unfortunately destroyed by artillery fire.)</p>
<p>(B) Economic Assistance—The society's current rented address is rented free of charge by the Race Club (184 Maho Road). However, other expenses, such as the salaries of inspectors and secretaries, must be paid. According to the donations and membership fees received in 1936, the total income was 7,289 yuan, while the expenses for veterinarians and salaries, etc., totaled 8,654 yuan, resulting in an overdraft of more than 1,300 yuan. However, the society will not stop because of this, because social morality is waiting to be promoted and spread throughout the country. If the Shanghai society stops, the respondents in the interior will inevitably lose their support. I sincerely hope that compatriots can generously donate, and the livestock will be greatly benefited.</p>
<p>General Information on Rabies—Rabies is originally a disease of dogs, although other animals, such as cats, horses, and cattle, are also infected. Even if jackals and wolves are bitten, they can be infected with rabies. However, among the animals in China, the ones that should be feared are usually only cats and dogs, but horses have also been infected with this disease. Other livestock are rarely infected with this disease. As for the transmission of rabies, it is extremely simple. The saliva of animals suffering from rabies can spread the disease. The saliva already contains toxic substances one week before the symptoms are discovered. If bitten by such an animal, or if its saliva touches a broken area of the skin, rabies can be transmitted. People are at risk of contracting rabies when cleaning a dog's muzzle, pulling out a bone from a dog's throat, or giving a dog medicine. Dogs are most likely to contract this disease. Sometimes, their broken claws may accidentally touch the saliva of a rabies patient and become infected. Even when chasing other rabies patients, it can be transmitted through the nostrils. The most common way for dogs to get rabies is from cats, because ordinary garden fences are not enough to prevent rabid cats from entering.</p>
<p>Common Symptoms of Rabies (A) Dogs suffering from rabies first do not eat, are mentally depressed, and have a fever. Then they become restless and keep getting up and lying down. People who are usually very familiar with them can see that their temperament has changed suddenly. Sometimes they are sincere and friendly, and sometimes they are perverse and irritable. All of these phenomena are unprecedented. (B) Dogs suffering from rabies, regardless of the depth of the disease, have a lower bark than usual, and it sounds like a brass ring, which is quite special. To describe it in words, it can be called a kind of short, angry bark, followed by several barks of varying lengths.</p>
<p>Types of Rabies (A) Furious Rabies—Dogs suffering from this type of disease often bite randomly into the air, or leave home and go out for one or two days. When they return, they look haggard, are injured, and their temperament is completely changed. And they bite people, but people are bitten mostly because of a misunderstanding of the name "furious," thinking that since it is called furious, its state should be like this. What you see is a sick dog, walking along the road with its head drooping, sometimes staggering, and sometimes biting the objects it encounters along the way, so that people are caught off guard by the rabid dog. Pedestrians should be careful.</p>
<p>Wartime Shanghai Construction (3) Lin Lang</p>
<p>Rivers and Seawalls Shanghai's rivers are intricate and mostly tidal, making them extremely prone to silting. Over the past decade, the total length of dredged rivers has been 104,031 meters, with 2,806,814 cubic meters of earth excavated, costing a total of 687,725.1 yuan in engineering fees. The main projects were the dredging of the Wusong River, Puhui Pond, and mud dredging in the Shanghai South Wharf area. The Shanghai Municipality's three east-west dikes, Zhou Santang, are more than 24 kilometers long and have been neglected for many years, posing a dangerous situation. The Municipal Bureau of Public Works took over the dike project in June of the eighteenth year, and by June of the twenty-first year and September of the twenty-third year, the most dangerous parts were first repaired. The total engineering cost was more than 686,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Water Supply Management There are a total of four water supply operators in Shanghai. Among them, two are municipal, namely the Water Supply Department of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and the Pudong Water Plant of the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company (see separate article); the commercial operators are the Inland Water Company and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. Initially—in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China—the total daily water output of the Inland and Zhabei water plants was only 76,800 cubic meters, and the water quality was extremely turbid. After the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities supervised and improved the facilities, by the summer of the twenty-sixth year, the Inland Company's daily water output reached 97,000 cubic meters; the Zhabei Company's daily water output increased to 68,200 cubic meters. Supplying to the respective business areas, the water volume was quite sufficient. As for water quality, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and the Municipal Health Bureau stipulated cleanliness standards, and the test results were within the standards and quite pure. The two companies also planned to add water plants and other equipment before the war. At that time, it was estimated that after the expansion, the water output could be increased to 68,000 cubic meters for the Inland Company and 35,800 cubic meters for the Zhabei Company. The Water Supply Department of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities was established in July of the twenty-second year, transferring water supply to the Xujiahui Hager Road area and the water used by ships berthed at the Shanghai South Wharf. In February of the twenty-fourth year, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works also contracted with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to undertake the water supply in the Wusong area. The process of expanding the Inland and Zhabei water plants is roughly as follows: In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the water output of both plants was insufficient to meet the needs of the respective company's business area, so that Xujiahui and other places in Zhabei were supplied across the border by foreign water companies. After the establishment of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, the bureau repeatedly urged the two plants to expand their equipment and increase the water volume to meet the needs of the citizens. By June of the twenty-first year, the Inland Company's newly built rapid filtration ponds and coagulation sedimentation ponds and other projects were completed, and the daily water output increased greatly. By the twenty-fourth year, the population in the business areas of the Inland and Zhabei companies had increased rapidly, so coagulation sedimentation ponds, rapid filtration ponds, and water towers and other projects were added. It is estimated that after the completion of all the projects, the Inland Company can increase the water output to 165,000 cubic meters, and the Zhabei Company can increase it to 104,000 cubic meters. If the average daily water consumption per person is calculated at 115 liters for the Inland Company and 85 liters for the Zhabei Company, then the Inland Company can supply a population of 1.5 million, and the Zhabei Company can also supply 1.2 million people. If the population growth rate in the business areas of the two companies in the past ten years is estimated, the water output of the two companies can maintain the supply for more than ten years. Recovering the cross-border water supply is also one of the main tasks undertaken after the establishment of the Bureau of Public Utilities. In various areas of Shanghai, the cross-border water supply by foreign companies has occurred in the areas of North Shanghai, West Shanghai, and Xujiahui. Except for West Shanghai, in the twenty-sixth year, the Bureau of Public Utilities, in accordance with the principles set by the central government, discussed with the Shanghai West Shanghai Water Company Preparatory Committee to form a Sino-foreign joint venture West Shanghai Water Company. All of the areas of North Shanghai and Xujiahui have been recovered separately. In the North Shanghai area, the British Shanghai Water Company has been supplying water across the border, and its scope has extended from Zhabei to Yinxiang Township. The Bureau of Public Utilities first stopped the company from promoting routes and then urged the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to expand its equipment to replace it. In July of the twentieth year, the Zhabei Company and the Shanghai Company signed a contract, in which the Zhabei Company purchased all the water pipes occupied by the Shanghai Company on the roads of the Chinese界. The original users of the Shanghai Company on both sides of the road built across the border were supplied with water in the name of the Zhabei Company. The water supply in the Xujiahui area was originally supplied across the border by the French Electric Tramway Company. Later, although there was an intention to recover it, it was not implemented due to the insufficient capacity of the Inland Water Company. In the twenty-second year, the Bureau of Public Utilities established a water supply department and first prepared water for Xujiahui and ships at the Shanghai South Wharf. At the end of September of the twenty-second year, the French company and the Inland Company went through the handover procedures; in February of the twenty-third year, the Bureau of Public Utilities also went through the replacement procedures with the French company. Therefore, the water supply in the Xujiahui area was recovered one after another; all of the water from the water supply department of the Bureau of Public Utilities was transferred to the Inland Company for application.</p>
<p>Electricity In Shanghai, the electricity business is operated separately by six companies, including the Huashang Electric Company, Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, Pudong Electric Company, Xianghua Electric Company, Zhenru Electric Company, and Husi Electric Company, each in their respective business areas. Except for the Husi Electric Company, which is operated by a Sino-foreign joint venture and does not generate its own electricity, relying on the current from the Shanghai Electric Power Company, all other companies are operated by Chinese. In the twenty-sixth year, the total generating capacity of the Huashang Electric Company was 16,000 kilowatts, and the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company was 22,500 kilowatts, which was still insufficient to supply the five electric companies in the city. The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities urged the Zhabei and Huashang companies to expand their equipment. The Zhabei Water and Electricity Company added a 12,500-kilowatt generator, which was completed and generating power before the war; later, because the power generation was still insufficient, it continued to order the same 12,500-kilowatt generator. The Huashang Electric Company added two 15,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators, which were still under construction as of the start of the war. At that time, the Pudong Electric Company was also building a 10,000-kilowatt power plant. The electricity in Husi and North Shanghai has been supplied across the border by the settlement for a long time. After repeated negotiations between the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and the Shanghai Electric Power Company, and with the approval of the higher authorities, a contract was signed in January of the twenty-fourth year to establish the Husi Electric Power Co., Ltd. The distribution of the company's shares was 49% for Chinese shares and 51% for foreign shares, and it was completely under the supervision of the Shanghai Municipal Government. As for the North Shanghai area, after the establishment of the Husi Electric Power Company, the Shanghai Electric Power Company handed over the cross-border power supply portion of North Shanghai in batches; however, due to various reasons, the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company had not been able to completely recover it as of the summer of the twenty-sixth year.</p>
<p>Telephone The telephone business in Shanghai, except for the settlement area operated by the American Shanghai Telephone Company, all of South Shanghai, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Pudong, and other places are operated by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation. Several years ago, the telephone in the urban area was not very satisfactory to the citizens. Later, the bureau worked hard to expand and changed the manual switchboard to an automatic telephone, which was sensitive to calls and greatly increased the number of users. As of the summer of the twenty-sixth year, there were 4,727 users, 4,950 automatic telephone exchanges, and 1,050 manual switchboard exchanges. Many users in the urban area were served by the American Shanghai Telephone Company. After repeated negotiations between the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, a temporary telephone contract was signed in April of the twenty-second year, stipulating the business area of the Shanghai Telephone Company and its rights and obligations, as a prelude to the recovery of the telephone installation rights in the urban area and the cross-border road construction area.

<h3>Yarn Flower Snatching Hats Trend Moves to the Spot Yarn Market The Difference Between Double Horse and Shepherd is More Than Sixty Yuan The Disparity Between Popular and Unpopular Goods is So Great</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to advance into a better state. Although the demand from the Hong Kong and Chaozhou gangs is not very strong, sporadic purchases continue uninterrupted. Therefore, operators and practitioners unanimously purchase, so that the market is brisk and the market transaction is very lively. In addition, the operators in the former general exchanges are currently in the above-isolated islands, with no work to do, and most of them are engaged in the spot yarn market, entering and exiting from time to time. According to this situation, the complexity of the business and the speed of changes are inevitable. The afternoon floating households' hat-snatching transactions increased significantly, the atmosphere was active, and the target was still focused on the Tiannv and Shuangma brands. Other unpopular yarns were still dull and motionless. The price difference between 20-count Shepherd and Shuangma yarn was as high as more than sixty yuan. At present, the transaction is stagnant and small. Once the actual sales are active, the rise of unpopular goods will also be unstoppable.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened very tightly in the morning, and the shouts of colleagues were loud, and it was lively for a while. The opening price increased by two yuan, and the unit price of 20-count Shuangma was 426 yuan. Forty bales were transacted by colleagues, and the Guangbang Wanxing had no father to change, and the spot demand was clear. It has been delayed for a long time and has not been made. It is said that the spot business is relatively short. After a while, the Hong Kong gang entered eighty bales, the price was 435 yuan, and the market was slightly calmed down because the spot sales were still small and enthusiastic. By the time of the closing, the price of 20-count Shuangma foreign warehouse goods was 432 yuan, and the warehouse unit price was 423 yuan. The opening of the platform after the dry was more expensive than in the morning, and scattered households came to throw in ten or five bales, which was very crowded. Judging by its nature, it is probably the principle of snatching hats. Adding one yuan to the warehouse unit price made it 425 yuan, and the foreign warehouse price was 435 yuan. The closing warehouse unit price was 423.5 yuan, and the spot price was 434 yuan. It was found that 1,205 bales were traded in the morning, and 980 bales were traded in the afternoon, for a total of 2,205 bales. The market was sluggish, Shuangma rose by 1.5 yuan, Tiannv was flat, Shepherd rose by 1 yuan, and the price of a few earth globes, especially Jincheng, rose by 6 yuan. 32-count Danv Shuangma rose by 8 yuan. The factory opened 250 bales of 20-count Flying Tiger from Anda Factory, the price was 415 yuan, and it will open in May and June. The cloth factory bought it, and collected 40 foreign yuan per bale. Today, 650 pieces of cotton yarn are transported to Tianjin, 888,885 pieces are transported to Shantou, 755 pieces are transported to Hong Kong, 300 pieces are transported to Guangzhou Tao, 380 pieces are transported to Beihai, and 25 pieces are transported to Haiphong. The amount purchased by the guest gang is listed on the left: Hong Kong 170 colleagues 1,245 Shantou 550 Yunnan 30 Mainland 0 Fuzhou 40 Statistics 2,205</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is exceptionally calm. Judging from its trend, there is a risk of decline because the selling prices of yarn and cloth in Qingdao, Dalian, and the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are lower than the market prices in Shanghai, and there are no sales. However, the good quality of this yarn will bring it one step better. The closing price of 20-count Yueqin yarn was 371 yuan, which was about the same as the previous day.</p>
<h3>U.S. Cotton Subsidy Bill Was Rejected Yesterday The Transaction of Local Cotton is Like Stagnation 5,000 Bales of Brazilian Cotton Were Ordered Again</h3>
<p>The spot price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, showed a weak state yesterday. At the opening, due to some head-covering purchases and long closures, it fell by four to six pounds of sound. Later, due to public forecasts, the passage of the export subsidy bill was rare, and most colleagues waited and watched, waiting for the final development in Washington. Yesterday, Washington also held a meeting to discuss the export subsidy draft proposed by Hai. As a result, it was not passed with only 37 to 36 votes, but it will be discussed again within days. Yesterday, India remained unchanged from the forecast, and Egypt rose by more than ten pounds of sound. Converted into legal currency, American cotton and Brazilian cotton each fell by one corner, Indian cotton remained unchanged, and Egypt rose by eight corners.</p>
<p>The transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has not been moved by the factory in recent days, but the colleagues have been progressing quite strongly. It is acceptable that the most spinnable is 32-count Brazilian cotton. The total number of Brazilian cotton ordered by the colleagues in the past few days has reached as high as tens of thousands of bales. 5,000 bales were ordered again yesterday, most of which will be shipped in July, and the arrival date in Shanghai will be in mid-September. The factory price of yesterday's cotton market is listed below. Raw material category, factory delivery including tax 60-count Egyptian cotton, premium 1,04.9, secondary, 101.9 80-count, premium 35.35, secondary 24.9 20-count, Metering 90.40, inferior 77.25 22-count, 99.25, inferior 90.30 43-count, 101.10, inferior 89.05, South American Brazilian cotton, premium 88.65, secondary 86.45, inferior 83.10 10-count Indian Apple 65.05 16-count Indian Muller 71.40 20-count Indian Brock 77.00 24-count Indian Compo Di 83.00 32-count American Kindt 86.60 32-count American Penga Pu 91.15</p>
<p>The dullness of the local cotton business is completely in a state of stagnation. The respective businesses have not been acting, and in fact the goods are scarce. There is a great risk of not having goods to buy, so the transaction is decreasing day by day. According to this situation, the future of local cotton is very worrying. Fortunately, the spot price of foreign cotton is in a stable state, and the factories can purchase and order at any time for remedy, so there is absolutely no problem with the factory's work. No pack from the source of Northern Jiangsu has arrived, and only two spot trades of foreign cotton have been transacted by colleagues. As for the selling price, the future freight is a few yuan higher than that of the previous day. Today, 30 pieces of cotton are transported to Hong Kong. The current spot situation is as follows: Brazilian cotton 88.00 Colleagues entered, 329 pieces, spot cash exchange Brazilian cotton 87.50 Colleagues entered, 400 pieces, spot cash exchange</p>
<h3>Finance 北帮 Stops Selling, Spot Silver Initially Drops then Recovers, Trading Reaches Over a Thousand Taels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai spot silver market, though still relatively quiet, showed some activity, with prices initially dropping sharply before suddenly rebounding. After breaking the 2,120 yuan mark, it bounced back. Although a certain gold firm (acting for a certain client) continued to purchase, and some banks were also buying, the market was inherently weak due to the easing of the US dollar exchange rate. Furthermore, the stockbrokers (acting for the Tianjin clique) continued to sell, and money changers also switched from buying to selling. The price plummeted from 2,125 yuan straight to a low of 2,116 yuan. In the afternoon, a sudden rebound occurred. The North clique stopped selling, and the Hong Kong clique only released 100 taels. Meanwhile, the money changers became increasingly aggressive in buying (reportedly acting for wealthy Shanghai residents), and the price was eventually raised.</p>
<p>The closing price was 2,122 yuan, but still slightly lower by three yuan. Sentiment among various parties was somewhat uncertain. Trading was quite active, with a total of over a thousand taels changing hands in the morning and afternoon. Gold ornaments were priced one yuan lower. Customs gold, Sino-British pure gold, etc., all fell.</p>
<p>Spot Silver Drops Slightly by Three Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) was initially stable, with a slight softening. The market opened half a yuan lower, with gold firms trading 50 taels back and forth at a price of 2,124.5 yuan. It quickly returned to the previous level, rising half a yuan. Jewelry stores, money changers, and a certain bank each released 50 taels to another money changer, all at a price of 2,125 yuan. The stockbrokers suddenly began selling, and the market immediately turned from stable to weak. The stockbrokers sold 50 taels to a gold firm, priced at 2,124 yuan, but there were even fewer buyers, and the decline intensified. They sold another 100 taels to a gold firm, then released 50 taels each to a bank and a money changer, all at a price of 2,120 yuan. At noon, the stockbrokers vigorously sold over a hundred taels, dropping another four yuan. Money changers traded 50 taels back and forth. The market closed at noon, retreating to 2,116 yuan. In the afternoon, because the North clique did not continue selling, sentiment immediately strengthened. The market opened two yuan higher, with money changers trading 50 taels back and forth at a price of 2,118 yuan. Then, a gold firm bought 50 taels at 2,118.5 yuan. The Hong Kong clique suddenly released another 100 taels, and the price dropped by 1.5 yuan. A jewelry store sold 50 taels to a money changer for 2,117 yuan. Later, the Hong Kong clique also stopped selling, and buyers were still enthusiastic. The market initially rose five yuan, then rebounded twenty yuan. Money changers traded 50 taels back and forth, and the closing price was 2,122 yuan, but still slightly lower by three yuan compared to the previous day. The entire day had a nine-yuan difference between high and low. The selling price of spot gold from cash shops was 2,125 yuan, with a buying price of 2,115 yuan. The buying and selling prices for spot gold were still 50 yuan lower than the above price, and there were no reports of any activity.</p>
<p>Gold Ornaments Priced One Yuan Lower</p>
<p>The exchange price for gold jewelry in jewelry stores remained unchanged initially. Upon hearing that spot silver had fallen below 2,120 yuan, they uniformly lowered prices by one yuan at 10:30 AM. Ta Tung Hang was selling at 215 yuan, and Hsin Tung Hang was selling at 213 yuan, with a buying price of 207 yuan for both.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Falls Half a Penny</p>
<p>London, November 11th - British pure gold continued to fall by half a penny, retreating to 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5 pence per ounce. Customs gold, which is listed by central banks and had not changed for a long time, suddenly dropped slightly by 0.02, equivalent to 2.394 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price dropped slightly by 0.03, equivalent to 1,206.9 yuan. The buying price for Chinese pure gold retreated to 1,211.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Dollar Exchange Supply Quite Plentiful, Initially Eases then Returns to Level</h3>
<p>Although the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank was active in the exchange market yesterday (acting for the Tianjin clique), and major foreign firms were also collaborating, the supply of US dollars from various foreign banks, including British and American banks, was quite good, allowing the US dollar exchange rate to rise. This was mainly because the British-American exchange rate was strong. Midway, the American Express Bank sold spot US dollars to foreign firms at 16.0625 and 16.09375 yuan, so the situation was slightly firm within stability. However, there were few changes in futures contracts, and transactions were mainly between Chinese and foreign banks. Trading was still active. Because Chinese banks were aggressively buying Hong Kong dollars, the exchange rate eased slightly.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the difference between London's large bars, both near and far, was 0.0125. The silver price in New York was unchanged. The price of raw gold in London was down by half a penny. The British-US exchange rate rose by 0.03, while the rates against Shanghai and France remained unchanged. The US dollar rate against the British pound was unchanged, while it was down 0.01 against Shanghai and up 0.000625 against France. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices for spot exchanges in the morning were 8.0025 for the British pound and 16.0625 yuan for the US dollar, both the same as the previous close. Although the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank was active after the opening (again acting for the Tianjin clique) and collaborated with foreign firms, there was no change because the foreign banks' supply was very good. It was estimated that the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank was buying spot British pounds at 8.0025 yuan. Following this, foreign firms also bought spot British pounds from the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank at 8.0025 yuan. Until the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank's listed prices were announced, there were no movements, and the silver ox tax was announced to have returned to 2.5%, with a calculated tax rate of 5.50%. After this, foreign firms bought spot US dollars from a certain bank at 16.0625 yuan. Then, American Express Bank sold spot US dollars to foreign firms at 16.0625 and 16.09375 yuan, so the market was stable with a slight firmness. Soon, Banque Belge pour l'Etranger traded British pounds for this month at 8.0021875, and also traded US dollars for June at 15.9375, so the situation turned to level. At noon, foreign firms, including the Asia Development Bank, sold spot Hong Kong dollars to money changers and foreign firms at 95.5 and 95.375 yuan, and the situation was also level. Until the banks' spot selling prices closed at noon, the British and US exchange rates were no different from the morning, with the Hong Kong dollar at 55.375 yuan.</p>
<p>Although foreign firms continued to buy in the afternoon, the foreign banks' supply was still strong, so it was difficult for any changes to occur. First, foreign firms bought spot British pounds from the Hong Kong &amp; Shanghai Bank at 8.0025 yuan, and also bought spot US dollars from Chase Bank at 16.0625 yuan. Later, American Express Bank sold June US dollars to Banque Belge pour l'Etranger at 15.9375 yuan, so the process was stable. After entering the market, Banque Belge pour l'Etranger forcefully sold spot Hong Kong dollars to foreign firms and money changers at 55.5 yuan, and the situation eased slightly. Until the banks' spot selling prices closed in the evening, the British pound was at 8.0025, the US dollar was at 16.0625, and the Hong Kong dollar was at 55.5 yuan. As a result, compared to the closing prices the night before last, the British pound and the US dollar saw no gains or losses, while the Hong Kong dollar strengthened by 0.0125.</p>

Later, jewelry stores and money changers sold off, and the price plummeted. The market closed at noon with a significant drop.

<h3>Securities When Will the Bond Market Stop Fluctuating?</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the securities black market continued to fluctuate, with weak sentiment and sluggish market prices. This situation has persisted for a long time, and there are still no signs of a breakthrough. Discussions of peace have become a fantasy, and the environment can be described as eventful. However, various parties have consistently adhered to their approach, and although there are signs of being in a dilemma, they are still unwilling to show weakness. The shorts, on the other hand, are seeking to sell at high prices and are also unwilling to sacrifice unnecessarily. Therefore, the longer the mutual holding continues, the more rigid it becomes, ultimately leading to a situation of dense clouds but no rain. The future is not easy to activate. As for yesterday's events, Gan Hao was still buying in the morning, and Xie Da and Yong Feng were also buying. Sellers such as Yong Kang, Hong Da, No. 4, Lian He, and others sought to sell a small number of shares. At noon, various bonds were slightly higher by 0.05 or 0.1. In the afternoon, Nos. 49 and 42 and Tong Kang sold, and the buyer Gan Hao had a slight appetite, returning 0.05. As a result, only Category A and D bonds rose by 0.05, while the rest remained unchanged. The trading volume was about 400,000 yuan.</p>

The price of the Ruirong stock did not fluctuate much, hovering between 7.80 and 7.85 yuan.

<h3>Piece Goods The Austrian Clique Remains Active, Cotton Mill Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>The cloth market has recently seen a sharp increase in demand from the Guangdong clique, so the prices of white goods and dyed cloth are stable. The factory prices of goods from Chinese and British factories, such as Jardine Manufacturing's coarse cloth, are as high as 0.70 or 0.80 yuan per piece more than the market prices of goods in hand. Recently, the factories have also lacked large-scale production of fine cloth and fine twill, as they have mostly taken good orders in recent months. Yesterday, the Guangdong clique continued to purchase over 2,000 pieces of colored twill, colored cloth, and poplin, and hundreds of cases of fine cloth and coarse cloth. Purchases from Shantou and Hong Kong also improved, with 50 or 60 bales of fine cloth and fine twill, and nearly 100 boxes of poplin, bleached cloth, standard cloth, and colored twill. Recently, the Wenzhou clique has been shipping returned goods in batches, and there has been a lack of new goods for the time being. 20 or 30 cases of natural-colored cotton cloth, coarse cloth, and woven cloth were also traded from Wenzhou to Anhui Province. Customer groups entrusted to purchase and stock 50 or 60 cases of fine cloth and fine twill. Purchases from northern Jiangsu Province remained strong, adding over 50 bales of Peacock and Artillery brands of fine cloth and Jardine coarse cloth, and over 2,000 pieces of light and dark-colored cloth, poplin, bleached cloth, linen yarn, and printed goods. Wholesale trading of poplin, linen, standard cloth, canvas, and khaki cloth continued to be strong among clothing firms on this street, reaching 3,000 or 4,000 pieces. Orders for colored twill, colored cloth, cotton yarn, and poplin from Tianjin, Sichuan, and Yunnan cliques in the northwest were very numerous, with few new spot transactions. The Tianjin clique was most interested in velvet and wool fabrics for the autumn season of July, August, and September. The market for white goods turned stable yesterday, and large households in the bedding industry continued to purchase good cloth, and there were few goods in the hands of retail investors. Those who were short felt that the benefits were small and the harm was great, and speculation subsided, and the market has gradually entered the right track. High-end fine cloth of various brands hovered around 13.70 or 13.80 yuan throughout the day, with the leading market price being 13.85 yuan, up 0.10 yuan per piece. Yanghe fine twill was still sold for 13 yuan. Qingdao buyers purchased over 200 cases of fine cloth and fine twill, and local industry peers and distributors continued to purchase 800 or 900 cases. Foreign firms still did not open for business.</p>
<p>Exports 112 cases of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin, 110 cases to Yantai, 290 cases to Shantou, 150 cases to Hong Kong, 60 cases to Guangzhou Bay, 10 cases to Beihai, and 650 cases to Haiphong on the 13th.</p>
<h3>Grains Demand for Flour is Weak, Market is Clearly Stable, but Secretly Relaxed</h3>
<p>The flour market is trending toward being clearly stable, but secretly relaxed. Transactions by local customers have not been active for many days, as the Northern clique's demand for Shanghai flour has been very weak due to the falling flour prices in the local area and the impact of foreign flour dumping. The Southern clique is also only making sporadic purchases. However, the factory prices have not been lowered, as they fear that lowering prices now would not stimulate sales, so they are unwilling to make too many concessions and are waiting for the market to be determined at the beginning of next week. The total market transaction volume for various brands of flour was only slightly less than 30,000 bags. No. 2 flour is still priced at 4.55 yuan in cash, but there are reports of reclaimed goods being lowered by 0.05, and the market has entered a state of being clearly stable, but secretly relaxed.</p>
<p>22,000 bags of flour were exported to Tianjin, 4,000 bags to Weihaiwei, and 1,000 bags to Shantou on the 13th.</p>
<p>Foreign flour remains quiet. The Northern clique once began to make purchases, but is now waiting and seeing, as Tianjin is flooded with foreign flour, and market prices have been severely impacted. However, sentiment in the Shanghai market is still good, as foreign production prices are frequently rising, and futures contracts are difficult to match, and they conflict with the new wheat coming onto the market, so no one is interested. Most of the foreign flour currently in stock on the market is waiting for prices to rise before being sold, regardless of whether it is a quick sale, so the market continues to hold. The price of mid-range brands is 4.50 to 4.55 yuan, similar to local flour, and trading is quite quiet.</p>
<h3>Superior Customer Rice Sells at the Same Price as Local Pointed Rice, Premium Northern Japonica Rice Exceeds 16 Yuan on the Black Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of various Tu Geng rices did not arrive from Hsia Ho, and only 1,300 or 1,400 bags of Che Lun Baozi rice came from the Su Tong clique. Due to the continued soaring prices of rough rice in the interior and the obstruction of transportation, the price of Northern Japonica rough rice has reached 10 yuan, and the price of Bo Dao rough rice in districts such as Songsi has reached 13.50 yuan. Shanghai merchants, upon hearing this news, have mostly been holding their ground, and no samples of premium Northern Japonica rice have been released. Southern Japonica and Bo Dao rice are also in short supply, and the market situation is chaotic. Although the association has made every effort to strictly limit prices, and the appraisal committee has engaged in registration, there are widespread rumors on the market of black market prices exceeding 16 yuan, but because these people are very wary and transactions are extremely secretive, it is impossible to investigate and verify. However, except for those who are determined to continue taking delivery of their Customer Pointed rice at a premium of 0.20 or 0.30 yuan, premium goods are all sold as local pointed rice. Therefore, although there is a price limit, the actual price is secretly raised a lot. Is this not an abnormal state of the market? Du Bu Pointed rice is still priced at 15 yuan, and rice merchants are still filling it with foreign glutinous rice and holding their ground. Hong Kong glutinous rice is priced at 19.50 to 19.30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Blocked Transportation from Producing Areas, Customer Indica Rice is Sold Quickly and Prices Rise Again, Premium Goods Rise 0.10 or 0.20, Medium Quality Goods Rise 0.20 or 0.30</h3>
<p>Since news of the blocked transportation of Customer Indica rice from the producing areas, the market atmosphere has gradually become tense, and those who have entered the market are also keen on buying due to the lower prices, so the demand yesterday was still active. The price of medium quality goods was raised by 0.20 or 0.30 again, and the price of premium goods rose by 0.10 or 0.20. Premium Wu Indica rice and Jing Indica rice also stopped releasing samples. The price of medium quality goods has reached 14 yuan, and polished rice is priced at 13.50 or 13.60 yuan. Newly arrived Jing, Wu, Yu, and other rough rices were actively traded, with prices ranging from 12.55 to 12.30 or 11.78 yuan. Foreign rice is still priced at the original levels, but merchants are unwilling to release goods readily. There have been several orders from Saigon that are being negotiated by telegram, and whether or not they will become a reality remains to be seen. Foreign round grain rice continues to arrive, but the selling price has not been surprising.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Foreign Sugar Plummets Continuously</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was extremely weak as a result of the sharp drop in London telegraphic dispatches. Yesterday's telegraphic dispatch indicated a price of 0.035 lower for the August contract and a price of 0.01 lower for the longer-term December contract and the March contract of the following year. As a result, the sugar association's prices were extremely soft. Current No. 24 coarse white sugar plummeted by 0.70 yuan to 27.10 yuan at local godowns and 26.90 yuan at foreign godowns. Merchants holding stocks at customs godowns were still releasing their goods. The initial market price was 18.90 yuan, which then dropped to 18.85 or 18.80 yuan, with 1,200 bags traded. Prices dropped by 0.60 or 0.70 yuan overall. Taikoo Crystal White sugar also dropped by 0.50 or 0.60 yuan. B-marked West godown prices started at 27.05 yuan, then dropped to 27.00 yuan and 26.90 yuan, with 400 bags traded. Dutch red sugar did not fluctuate much. The price of local refined white sugar dropped by 0.50 yuan: Zhenji No. 1 was at 27 yuan, No. 2 was at 26.50 yuan, No. 3 was at 26 yuan, and No. 4 was at 25.50 yuan. Chinese sugar merchants were unwilling to lower prices, and trading was sluggish. 1,620 pieces of sugar were shipped from Shantou to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cake Soybean Oil Being Manipulated Again, Afternoon Market Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean oil market situation, with both arrivals and inventories being plentiful, was still weak. At the start of the morning, Dalian oil prices fell by 1.5 yuan, with over 100 barrels traded at a price of 36.50 yuan. Yantai Zhifu settled 110 cases at a price of 27.50 to 27.30 yuan. Lian Zhifu oil settled 50 cases at a price of 34 yuan. In the afternoon, rumors spread in the market that a certain foreign firm was buying again, and it was said that foreign firms were bullish and hoarding the arriving spot goods, causing the atmosphere to suddenly tighten. Speculators believed that there was no smoke without fire and saw an opportunity to take advantage, and the market was raised both openly and secretly, and prices rose back to the original levels of the previous day. It was estimated that Dalian oil was priced at 38 yuan, but only two barrels were traded. Lian Zhifu was at 35.50 yuan, with 30 cases traded.</p>
<p>Today, 330 bags of soybeans were shipped to Hong Kong, and 1,070 cases of sesame oil were also shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Silk Prices Remained Unchanged All Day</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk market saw weak prices overseas and calm prices locally, with no trading occurring throughout the day. Yokohama spot and forward prices opened at the same levels as the previous day. New York spot prices fell by 0.02, and forward prices rose by 0.015. Japanese silk was at 83.75 cents, down 0.07 in both cases. Shanghai silk was down 0.06. The prices of Li silk fluctuated slightly, with a difference of only about half a franc. Observing the current silk market overseas, it seems that the prices have risen enough and are now retreating, and buyers and sellers are waiting and seeing. The local market situation is similar. Foreign firms are showing little interest in buying, and manufacturers are unwilling to make concessions. Therefore, there has been no trading in the UK, France, India, etc. However, silk prices seem to be stable, and the development of the silk market still needs to wait until next week.</p>
<h3>Excellent Mei Tea Sells Well</h3>
<p>Since the first batch of new Huzhou teas opened the market a few days ago, various factories in the local foreign tea market have started production one after another. However, because the arrivals are still scarce, transactions are still small. Yesterday, only Fuhua Company purchased 11 cases of premium Gongli Gao Zhuang Zhen Mei tea, priced at 222 yuan, and Yongxing Foreign Firm traded 14 cases of Jixiang Cao Zhen Mei tea, priced at 240 yuan, and the market is said to be doing well. 22 cases of tea were shipped from Wenzhou yesterday.</p>
<h3>Hardware New Lead Wire Slightly Softens</h3>
<p>The new lead wire market, where the circulation of goods was previously very scarce and prices were rising steadily, has seen a slight decrease in sales in Tianjin and Qingdao recently. However, prices have been able to hold steady and have not fallen. Yesterday, No. 21 to No. 25 mixed colors were sold for 50 yuan, and No. 25 single coil goods were still priced at 70 yuan, with no change from before. However, it is not as strong as it was a week ago. Local businesses are making some purchases, which is helping to keep prices from falling.</p>
<h3>Coal The Ou River Resumes Navigation, Wenzhou Coal Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Selling prices continue to fall as a result. The source of charcoal has traditionally been eastern Zhejiang and Jiujiang in the Yangtze River. Since the Sino-Japanese War began and the Yangtze River was blockaded, the source of Jiujiang charcoal has been cut off. Therefore, we rely entirely on eastern Zhejiang, but only the Yongjia route. In the middle of last month, due to the ravages of Japanese warships along the coast of eastern Zhejiang, the Chinese military authorities, in order to strengthen defense, prohibited ships from entering and leaving ports such as Fu River, Jiao River, and Ou River. Therefore, shipping between Shanghai and eastern Zhejiang was cut off, and the source of charcoal was cut off. Recently, the coastal areas of eastern Zhejiang have relaxed slightly, so Zhoushan and Wenzhou have been opened to navigation, and the source of charcoal has become active. Yesterday, a batch arrived in Shanghai, totaling 20,684 baskets. It is said that another 10,000 baskets will be imported today, so the market news has spread, and people's hearts are calmed, and selling prices are continuing to fall. Yesterday, a certain firm offered 700 dan of Grade A charcoal, priced at 3.30 yuan per dan, which is lower than last week.</p>
<p>Indian bituminous coal is being purchased by customer groups and local businesses. The inventory in the market is thin, and market prices are about one yuan higher, with Indian mixed coal priced at 38 yuan per ton, screened lumps at 40 yuan, premium lumps at 42 yuan, and Kalkatha dust at 41 yuan. Deliveries from godowns in Pudong, with spot sales in Shanghai, add 2 yuan.</p>
<p>Indian coal continues to arrive in Shanghai. The Harmattan, managed by Jardine Matheson, recently arrived from Kalkatha with coal lumps and coal dust, totaling 7,485 tons. The ship arrived at 6 PM the day before yesterday and docked at the Qichang godown in Pudong for unloading, and the selling prices may fall back.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods Premium Golden Vegetables are Hoarded</h3>
<p>Since the closure of various sea ports for gold vegetables, the outlets in all directions have been greatly affected, and prices have frequently fallen, especially for mid- to low-end goods. However, due to the cut-off of sources, there has been no sharp drop. However, the market is often in a state of stagnation. Now that the season of mold in Hong Kong has passed and the previous high-priced goods have been cut off, purchases have been made in recent days, and the number is considerable. The market is showing signs of recovery. The previously opened Qian character vegetable at 26.50 yuan has now been opened to 28 yuan for the same quality Dou character vegetable, and merchants are very firm. Moreover, the inventories have all been re-dried and can be stored for a long time, so premium goods are being hoarded. However, there are concerns about over-optimism about shipments from Fujian, Xiamen, Shantou, Wenzhou, and Taiwan for mid- to low-end goods, and there may be a situation of raising prices and then cutting them later.</p>
<h3>Black Fungus Arrives, Asking Prices Gradually Ease</h3>
<p>Previously, due to inconvenient transportation and extremely high foreign fees, the market for black fungus, although soft, did not fluctuate excessively. Recently, a certain direct ship from Hankou has been transporting it, and the number of arrivals has gradually increased, and the price has become cheaper, so the market has gradually eased. In addition, the recent plunge in counterfeit tickets in North China has greatly impacted sales, and people are even more nervous. Yesterday, the market was only opened at 160 yuan, with few buyers.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports Goods Arrived from Wenzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Since the port of Wenzhou was closed, local paper, tobacco, tea oil, leather oil, milk, and fresh eggs were transported yesterday for the first time by British ships, totaling 20,620 cases of local paper, 256 cases of tobacco, 40 cases of tea oil, 1,100 cases of leather oil, 200 boxes of milk, and 5,090 cases of fresh eggs.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Fresh Eggs Arrive from Tianjin, Pottery Enters with 6,000 Pieces</h3>
<p>6,000 pieces of pottery were shipped from Shantou on the 10th. There were also 6,000 pieces of fresh eggs, 101 cases of egg yolk and egg white, 17 cases of wool, and 76 pieces of tin from Tianjin.</p>
<h3>Woolen Fabrics High-End Ballet Cloth is Selling Well</h3>
<p>Ballet cloth is selling well. Upscale Western clothing stores are all stocking it, mostly the high-end type priced at over 8 yuan per yard. Pure white and beige colors are popular, and gray also sells well. Small checks and chrysanthemum patterns are fashionable. Lower-end old-style crepe and striped Ballet cloth, priced at 4 or 5 yuan per yard, are less in demand. However, old-goods merchants in the Xiafei Road area, such as Dalu, Gongxing, Zhenan, Zhang Huaxing, and others, are purchasing from each other, catering to the tastes of customers and taking advantage of the low prices.</p>

<p>Traffic and Transportation Weekly</p>
<h3>From Hong Kong to the Philippines</h3>
<p>— Lai De</p>
<p>The Philippine Islands are a territory of the United States, located southeast of Hong Kong. Its capital, Manila (Manika), is what we often hear referred to as "Little Luzon." It is only 626 nautical miles from Hong Kong, and the fastest ships can reach it in 30 hours. By plane, the journey is only six hours. The scenery there is beautiful, and the land is rich and fertile, making it an excellent destination for travel and business. I will now write down the procedures and itinerary required to depart from Hong Kong to the Philippines:</p>
<p>Procedures: Because the Philippines are a territory of the United States, tourists or merchants do not need to apply to our government for a passport. It is sufficient to apply for a Section Six Certificate. The procedures for tourists to apply for this certificate are very convenient, but it is more difficult for merchants. Because many people apply for this type of certificate, applicants must first go to the Passport Section of the local U.S. Consulate to request a designated application time. After receiving the designated time from the U.S. Consulate, they must then go to the Consulate within the designated time to submit: (1) an application form, which must state the applicant's name, age, nationality, occupation, purpose of going to the Philippines, and economic status, etc.; (2) a letter of introduction from a local celebrity, merchant, or organization (preferably a bank), with content similar to the application form; (3) six 2.5-inch half-length photos. After submitting the above three items, the staff of the department will ask the applicant detailed questions. They will record the answers on the Section Six Certificate, so the answers must be accurate. After the U.S. Consulate reviews and deems the application qualified, they will write a letter to the local office of our government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which the applicant will deliver themselves. The officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will also ask the same questions and record them on the Section Six Certificate issued by our country. The applicant must then pay a certificate fee of ten yuan and submit three 2.5-inch half-length photos. After the office investigates, the certificate can be issued. After obtaining the Section Six Certificate, present it to the U.S. Consulate to exchange for a reserved berth certificate. Then, present that certificate to the China Travel Service, and they can reserve a berth for you to the Philippines. At the same time, they will also give you a confirmed berth certificate. Take the confirmed berth certificate and a visa fee of US$2.50 to the U.S. Consulate to exchange for the Section Six Certificate issued by our government and the Section Six Certificate from the U.S. Consulate. All of the above procedures take about a week to ten days.</p>
<p>Route: As for taking a ship to the Philippines, it is very difficult for third- and fourth-class passengers to disembark, and they may even be unable to disembark. Therefore, it is best to travel in first or second class. When booking a cabin, you must submit the berth certificate from the U.S. Consulate and a vaccination certificate issued by a local reputable doctor or hospital. The ticket prices are as follows:</p>
<h3>Xiang-Gui Railway – Extension of the Route</h3>
<p>— Que</p>
<p>The Xiang-Gui Railway starts from Hengyang, Hunan, and passes through Santang, Baihepu, Fengshiyan, Baidishi, Lijiaping, Qiyang, Lengshuitan, Lanjiacun, Dong'an, Huangshahe, Quanxian, Shaoshui, Xing'an, Dajunjiang, and Lingchuan, to reach Guilin, Guangxi, with a total length of 357 kilometers. It is the main transportation line connecting Hunan and Guangxi provinces. The track-laying project began in June of last year, and by August, the construction train was able to reach Lengshuitan. In September, it reached Quanxian, more than 230 kilometers from Hengyang, and then Xing'an, and sold passenger tickets, showing its rapid progress. By October, it had achieved the goal of full line operation. At the same time, it joined forces with the Yue-Han and Zhe-Gan Railways to implement joint transportation, which could run from Jinhua to Nanchang, Zhuzhou, Hengyang to Guilin, becoming a transportation line connecting the five provinces of Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Guangdong, Hunan, and Guangxi. After Nanchang was lost, the joint transportation was suspended. However, as of last month, the Xiang-Gui Railway itself still operates normally, and the joint transportation can still reach Yichun County, 241 kilometers from Nanchang, and has not abandoned its transportation mission due to the war.</p>
<p>The Xiang-Gui Railway has two types of trains: special express trains and mixed trains. The former has first, second, and third-class carriages and sleeping cars, while the latter only has second and third-class carriages. The special express train departs from Hengyang Fourth Station at 7:00 PM every day and arrives at Guilin North Station at 2:05 PM the next day, a journey of only 19 hours. The third-class fare between Hengyang and Guilin is 5.25 national currency, second class is double, first class is double again, first-class upper berth is 3.5 yuan, lower berth is 4.5 yuan, second-class upper berth is 2.5 yuan, lower berth is 3 yuan, third-class upper berth is 1 yuan, middle berth is 1.2 yuan, and lower berth is 1.5 yuan. According to reliable news, the railway has extended the route from Guilin to Liuzhou, and it will soon be open to Yongfu. The full line opening should not be far away.</p>
<h3>Southwest Highway Passengers – Ticket Purchase Registration Method</h3>
<p>— Jie</p>
<p>In order to maintain order in ticket sales at various stations and to facilitate passenger ticket purchases, the Southwest Highway Transportation Administration has stipulated the following passenger registration procedures:</p>
<p>(1) Each station shall be equipped with a "Passenger Ticket Purchase Registration Form," and all passengers purchasing tickets must register in order.</p>
<p>(2) When passengers apply to register to purchase tickets, in addition to registering on the registration form, they must also prepay a ticket fee of five yuan in legal tender. The station will issue a "Ticket Exchange Certificate," specifying the date and time of ticket purchase and travel, and give it to the passenger as proof of purchase and prepayment of the ticket price.</p>
<p>(3) Stations designated for registration shall, according to the bus schedule, take one bus per route per day as the standard. In addition to the tickets sold on behalf of the China Travel Service and three tickets for emergency official travel by the Bureau, registration shall be limited to twelve tickets per day and shall cease after fourteen days. Subsequent registration shall be based on the quantity of passengers already transported and replenished accordingly.</p>
<p>(4) The station master shall extract the registration forms daily in order and hand them over to the ticket seller for proper safekeeping, so that they can compare them with the ticket exchange certificates held by the passengers when selling tickets, collect the unpaid ticket fees, and issue tickets. The ticket exchange certificates must be taken back as proof. (5) Registered passengers must arrive at the station to purchase tickets before 2:00 PM on the day before the date specified on the ticket exchange certificate. Failure to do so will be considered a voluntary abandonment. The vacated seats will be filled by passengers on the waiting list, who will be notified with a ticket purchase notice signed by the station. Passengers who fail to arrive at the station to exchange their tickets on time can take their ticket exchange certificate to the station ticket office and claim a refund of the prepaid ticket fee of five yuan.</p>
<h3>Ford Gan Five-Seater Bus</h3>
<p>As shown in the picture, this is a public bus manufactured by the Meifeng Foreign Firm, the Tianjin Ford Management Office. It can seat 25 people and is mounted on a Ford chassis. It is beautiful, fast, and efficient.</p>
<h3>Dynamics of the Shanghai Shipping Industry</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>Shanghai, since its opening as a treaty port in 1843 (the 23rd year of the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing Dynasty), has formed the only transportation hub in China connecting to the world in just over a century. It is not only the largest city in the country but also one of the largest cities in the world, holding the center of the country's economy and culture and known as the key port for Far East trade. Its prosperity, growth, and rapid development are undeniable. The advancement of the transportation industry is truly astonishing. Since the outbreak of the war, land and air transportation have been successively suspended, but the shipping industry remains smooth. However, it is very different from before the war. Now, I will briefly describe the latest developments in the shipping industry:</p>
<p>Overseas shipping routes include European, American, African, Australian, Japanese, and Southeast Asian routes. The shipping conditions of each route are described below:</p>
<p>(A) European Route: Ships departing from Shanghai to Europe have destinations such as Brindisi, Venice, and Trieste (all in Italy), Marseille (France), London or Liverpool (England), Rotterdam (Netherlands), and Hamburg or Bremen (Germany). These are mostly operated by foreign companies. The names of the shipping companies, ship lineups, and ports of call are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Lloyd Triestino (Italian Shipping Company): The route starts from Shanghai, via Hong Kong (sometimes also Little Luzon), Singapore, Colombo, Mumbai, Suez, and Marseille, to Brindisi, Venice, and Trieste or Naples and Genoa in Italy. The ships include Conte Biancamano, Victoria (destination Genoa), Conte Verde, and Conte Rosso (destination Venice). Each ship is around 20,000 tons and the entire journey takes only 15 days. Departures from Shanghai are once every two weeks. Cabins are divided into first, second, economic second, and third class. It is recently reported that the company will add the giant ship "Rex" to the Far East route, further strengthening the lineup. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Travel Inquiries</h3>
<p>Mr. Feng Zhaoyi asks about traveling to Weixian, Shandong:</p>
<p>(Answer) First, take a Taikoo or Jardine Matheson company ship from Shanghai to Qingdao. Ticket prices are divided into 30, 20, and 12 yuan. After arriving in Qingdao, you can take the Jiaoji Railway to Weixian and arrive on the same day. The third-class fare is 2.8 yuan. Messrs. Mo Sijiang, Min Qingquan, Qian Yaoguang, Xu Chenbi, Ye Genxiang, Wang Jianjun, Wang Zhengyu, Wang Changmin, Ding Zhen, Li Bingyan, Zhu Renjie, Shi Enming, Wang Zi'ang, Yun Kejun, Cao Guoquan, Gu Fengjing, and Zai Jiemei ask about traveling to the interior via Vietnam:</p>
<p>(Answer) 1. A transit passport can be requested from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Chongqing through the China Travel Service, which takes three weeks and costs eight yuan. Then, after the French Consulate affixes a transit visa, you are allowed to depart. 2. An identity certificate must be issued by the school or organization and store where you are employed to be valid. 3. When passing through Vietnam, you must have a certificate of epidemic prevention and smallpox vaccination, issued by the health department of the British and French Municipal Council to be valid. 4. All daily necessities, if newly purchased, must be taxed according to regulations. 5. You can take a Taikoo or Jardine Matheson company ship from Shanghai to Fangcheng, which takes several days. The fares are 94 yuan for official cabins, 68 yuan for room cabins, and 37 yuan for steerage. 6. From Haiphong to Kunming, take the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The express train takes one day, and the slow train takes three days. The express and slow train fares are the same, 30.54 Vietnamese dollars for third class (equivalent to 51.92 national currency) and 10.14 Vietnamese dollars for fourth class (equivalent to 18.09 national currency). The express train runs every Tuesday and Thursday, and because there are very few seats, it is extremely difficult to buy tickets. You can bring 30 kilograms of luggage for free. The Michelin express train has no second or fourth class. 7. Kunming to Guiyang, the highway bus takes three days. The fare is 33.1 yuan. Guiyang to Chongqing takes two and a half days, and the fare is 24.4 yuan. Chongqing to Chengdu, the car takes two days, and the fare is 21.6 yuan. Chongqing to Yichang can be taken by boat, passing through Wanxian, which takes three days. The fares are divided into 60, 40, and 20 yuan. 8. A husband and wife can jointly apply for a passport, and children under 16 can also be included. In Haiphong, only French and Cantonese are commonly spoken.</p>
<p>Messrs. Liang Jieping, Yang Quan, Zhang Zikun, Hu Fuchu, Song Zhenyu, and Shi Shengda ask about the route from Shanghai to Hunan. (Answer) 1. To go to Hunan from Shanghai, if you take the route through the coastal ports of eastern Zhejiang, this route is no longer smooth. Although the Shanghai-Wenzhou route has now resumed, ticket buyers must have a guarantee from a local shop in Wenzhou, and restrictions are very strict, making it difficult to buy tickets. From Wenzhou, you can now travel to Dongxiang. Although there is a highway from Dongxiang to Ji'an, it is impossible to know whether it is open to traffic. From Ji'an to Hengyang, traffic is still normal, and it can be reached every other day, with a fare of over 21 yuan. 2. You can also take a route through Shantou, then Chaoyang, and transfer to Qujiang. From Qujiang, take the Yue-Han Railway train to Hengyang. It is now heard that this section of the highway is no longer smooth, travel is quite difficult and dangerous, but some travelers going to the interior still take this route to Hunan, so this newspaper does not recommend it. For the sake of safety and propriety, it is better to take the route through Vietnam. 3. For details of traveling to Hunan via Vietnam, please refer to the third issue of this publication. 4. To go to Shaoyang, you can take a highway bus from Guilin, which takes two days and costs about 18 yuan.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Yan of Pudong asks about the route to Luoyang and Nanyang in Henan Province:</p>
<p>(Answer) There are two routes to Henan Province: 1. Via Vietnam to Kunming, then follow the highway via Guiyang and Chengdu to Xi'an, then take the Longhai Railway train to Luoyang. The total cost is more than 210 yuan, and the fastest time to reach is 25 days. 2. Also, take the route through Vietnam, and after arriving in Vietnam, you can take a train via Hanoi to Dongdang on the Vietnamese border, then follow the highway via Zhennanguan, Nanning, and Liulin to Guilin. From Guilin, take the Xiang-Gui Railway to Hengyang, then transfer to the Yue-Han Railway train to Changsha, and then follow the highway via Changde, Xiangyang, and Nanyang to Luoyang. The total cost is more than 170 yuan, but the highway traffic between Changde and Luoyang is not smooth, and the date is difficult to predict. It takes about 20 days to reach.</p>
<p>Mr. Shen Wangguan asks about traveling to Yanping, Fujian:</p>
<p>(Answer) 1. First, take a ship from Shanghai to Fuzhou. The fares are 30 yuan for official cabins, 20 yuan for room cabins, and 12 yuan for steerage. After arriving in Fujian, you can take a small steamer or follow the highway to Nanping (i.e., Yanping). The steamer takes two days, and the fare is about five yuan. To take the car, you can first go to Jianzhen, the fare is more than six yuan, from Jianzhen to Nanping, the fare is 1.2 yuan.</p>
<p>For Mr. Qi Wang Mingde (inquiring about the route to Tunxi). A letter from a reader is available for you, entrusted to this newspaper for delivery. Please come and collect it! — Editor</p>

<h3>Art World Charity Sale for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— Lan Yan</p>
<p>3,000 Kinds of Various Art Works on Display</p>
<p>Including Chinese Painting, Western Painting, Sculpture, Photography, and Antiques</p>
<p>Opened Yesterday Morning, Selling 1,000 Yuan Worth</p>
<p>Welcome From All Walks of Life to Purchase and Implement Auctions</p>
<p>Under the slogan of "Nation First, Country First," a heated charity sale movement has begun. This movement is a good phenomenon on an isolated island.</p>
<p>The supplement of various newspapers in Shanghai news circles are holding article charity sales. Each newspaper is passionately promoting this movement. Next, the Shanghai theater circles will also hold a joint performance charity sale. It is said that they hope to raise 20,000 yuan. As for the "Shanghai Art World Charity Sale for Disaster Relief," held at 10:00 AM yesterday on the fourth floor of the Great New World, hosted by the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Art Writers Association, the situation was very lively. In the venue, there were many masterpieces created with the hard work of the artists, and they were also very wonderful. At the entrance, there were various beautiful women sketches by Gu Tingkang, who is famous in the art world for drawing beautiful women with crayons. Among them, many are not only soft and beautiful in color but also seem to be several times higher than the beauty pictures on general market calendars in terms of brilliance. We have already experienced Mr. Gu's works in previous industrial and commercial art exhibitions, and he is indeed unique.</p>
<p>Among the works, there is a portrait of Hua Mulan riding on a horse, shooting arrows sideways, with a face somewhat resembling Chen Yunshang. The listed price is also considered the highest among all the paintings, which is 1,000 yuan. Furthermore, we saw Zhang Yingchao, who has always appeared in the comics world with the style of Hollywood actresses. In this exhibition, he actually changed his style and created many Western-style Chinese paintings, which looked quite unique.</p>
<p>Du Jinsheng's brocade, a lot of items are displayed, such as painted screens, cushions, colored umbrellas, Buddha statue brocade screens, etc., which showed another feature in the venue.</p>
<p>Complementing Du Jinsheng's beauty is "Pei Kaidi" batik. The works include seat cushions and other specials. The pictures and styles are very elegant. Those who like classical-style batik seat cushions can go and purchase several kinds.</p>
<p>Going further inside, there are various Chinese and Western paintings.</p>
<p>In this part, watercolor paintings are mostly from the works of Ran Xi, who recently held a solo exhibition. His paintings like to use gray colors. From a distance, silhouettes that resemble a poem appear in a misty atmosphere. I personally love this lively style of Qian Tiao and his atmosphere.</p>
<p>Among the Chinese paintings, there are many good works, but one that is worth special mentioning is a young painter, Mr. Meng Anlan. He painted a painting that broke the old path of Chinese painting not painting realistic themes. His work is called "Autumn Forest Marching." It depicts a column of Chinese armed forces and a row of large cannons advancing in the wilderness and forests. How surprising this is!</p>
<p>Among the antiques, there are quite a few porcelain bowls and sculptures of ancient stone tools, etc., by Gu Tingkang. Among them, there are two types, such as "Small Stone Carved Han Painting Screen" and "Large Tang Dynasty Wood Carved Statue," all priced at 2,000 yuan. This shows the preciousness of these antiques.</p>
<p>In addition, there are photos by Roosevelt, Lang Jingshan, etc., all of which are very good works. Gu Tingkang also has two paintings here that are worth mentioning. One is "Sprout," which depicts two children in military uniforms holding hands opposite each other, with the inscription: "The source of national strength, the soul of the nation, ten years later, stepping on bloody footprints, move forward!" Another inscription is "Difficulty." The mother is blind, and the daughter is helping her walk. This, combined with Mr. Meng's work, is truly a thought-provoking work with anti-Japanese war significance.</p>
<p>As soon as it opened in the morning, 1,000 yuan worth of works were sold. According to people in the exhibition: they hope that someone will bid, that is, if you bid 20 yuan, and someone else bids 40 yuan, then the highest bidder gets the work.</p>
<p>The author's works can be divided into two types: one is that all proceeds are donated to charity after deducting the exhibition expenses; the other is that the author and the charity each receive half after deducting the expenses. The works in the venue that are completely for charity include Yan Wenliang's paintings and Roosevelt's, Lang Jingshan's, etc., which are all completely donated for charity.</p>
<p>The exhibition period is ten days, and the works are often changed. Even if you don't buy anything, you can go and take a look: if you can be generous and help, it will naturally create infinite benefits for the compatriots in distress. (Charity donation)</p>
<h3>Thoughts on "The Great Waltz"</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"The Great Waltz"</p>
<p>"The Great Waltz" is about the life of Johann Strauss, the founder of the waltz, starting from his fascination with music, his fiery romance with his beloved wife Poldi, and the female singer Carla, with the Austrian Revolution as an interlude. This is just like "Marie Antoinette," which writes about the life of Marie Antoinette and ignores the cause and effect of the French Revolution. The Austrian Revolution in "The Great Waltz" is just a faint shadow. The director of this film is the French director Julien Duvivier, who is a famous European film director. Johann Strauss is played by Miliza Korjus, known as "Schwarzkopf II." Poldi is played by Louise Rainer. Carla is played by opera diva Miliza Korjus. There is also a Russian musician who is responsible for collecting Strauss's music.</p>
<p>For this French director Julien Duvivier, who is appearing before us for the first time, his excellent skills are worth our praise. In every scene, he can tightly control the emotions and atmosphere; especially the use of "close-ups" and "close-up" following shots, which further enhance the touching power.</p>
<p>For example: (1) When Johann Strauss first performs at the Dulmay Cafe after being dismissed from the bank, the camera pulls away from the music stage. The entire cafe has no other guests except Poldi and her parents and Johann's mother. But when Carla and her entourage of officials enter, Johann plays a second piece, and the entire cafe is in an uproar. Here, the director used various close-ups of people flocking to the music, close-ups of the band, close-ups of Johann, close-ups of Poldi, close-ups of people cheering wildly, and the extremely long scene was handled so excitingly and vividly. (2) From the carnival waltz to the banquet at Count賀漢福履德's mansion, in this scene, he also used close-ups of Johann playing the piano and Carla singing his new song, and each close-up highlighted that even the waltz, which was considered barbaric music by noble people, aroused their interest. (3) Johann and Poldi's wedding. In a narrow and small room, it was also because of the proper use of close-ups that it was extremely lively. What is particularly lovely is that Johann and Carla took refuge in the hoofbeats of Vienna. A carriage advances in the forest at dawn. The sheep, the birds, the coachman's small harmonica solo, and the horn on the mail coach. In such a quiet environment, Johann and Poldi collaborated on the new song "Tales from the Vienna Woods." This is a wonderful scene in the film. Regardless of the angle of the camera, the coordination of music and past sounds, emotions and atmosphere, it has reached the peak. There are countless other examples, such as the waltz that Johann and Carla danced in the hotel; Carla told Johann the news of the Royal Theater's invitation, and the different emotional analysis of the three people – Johann, Poldi, and Carla; 賀漢福履德's Count persuaded Poldi to sabotage Johann and Carla's love; Poldi rushed to the theater to meet Johann and Carla; and finally Johann sent Carla away and spent a night obsessively on the Danube River, creating the eternally immortal song "The Blue Danube." In each scene, the director used a large number of close-ups to strengthen the atmosphere of each scene.</p>
<p>About the actors: Vina Graff and Miliza Korjus both performed very well. I don't know if the former has performed in other plays after "The Lady and the Tramp." If compared with these two works, it is really incomparable. The latter's high notes seem to surpass Grace Moore and Jeanette MacDonald. Louise Rainer's Poldi. I would like to cite two scenes to show her superior acting skills: When Carla came to report the news of the Royal Theatre's invitation, she was able to convey the sadness and anger in her heart with stagnant eyeballs; when she went to the backstage, she sacrificed herself with extremely painful emotions and smiled forcibly to say good night to everyone. After walking out the door, she leaned sadly on the railing of the staircase. Her smiling through tears was truly too touching.</p>
<p>In short, "The Great Waltz" is far more successful technically than "Cangsang Le Fu".</p>
<h3>Amu Lin Takes the Lead</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Taking the lead, sacrificing the most, and suffering the most, so no one wants to take the lead. Taking the lead is Amu Lin.</p>
<p>Lao Tzu, who is familiar with the art of living, said, "Do not be the first for others." Therefore, clever and sensible friends are mostly unwilling to be "the protruding nail," which is easy to offend others and easy to suffer. It is best for others to charge forward, and you stand behind to be a cheerleader.</p>
<p>But if no one dares to take the lead, the play cannot be sung. So, you push me, and I push you. This attitude of you pushing me is human intelligence, but individuals are like this, and so are international relations.</p>
<h3>Clear Skies After the Rain</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Bearing Sorrow and Suffering, Tears洒 the Four Walls, Practicing Thrift and Diligence, Tilling Ten Acres</p>
<p>These agricultural implements were not particularly complex. Chinese machinery factories were fully capable of manufacturing them themselves. Moreover, in recent years, our country's agricultural mechanization experts had been very innovative and had created many kinds of farming machines. At that time, Village Head Zhu, in conjunction with the village heads of several other villages, established many agricultural machinery stations. What did they call agricultural machinery stations? Each station housed a considerable number of agricultural machines, such as seeders, water pumps, tillers, and various other machines. If a village could not afford to purchase a machine but needed to use it, they could borrow it from the station. Some villages chose to purchase the machines collectively and make them public property. Others borrowed the machines first and then gradually reimbursed the station from each household. However, private individuals were not allowed to own such machines for the purpose of profiting from them. Like those who, before the war, owned a water-pumping machine called "Yimada" and installed it on a small boat. They rowed to the eastern village to pump water for people and rowed to the western village to pump water for people. Anyway, water was available everywhere. They would charge a certain amount for each acre of land they watered. There were also those who hulled rice and ground grain, also mounting machines on boats to solicit business. Village Head Zhu, however, was not seeking personal gain; he was working for the common good of the rural areas. But when collective farms were organized, each collective farm was able to operate its own machinery. Moreover, some had capabilities that went beyond agricultural mechanization, such as local water conservancy projects or agricultural electrification, involving large-scale engineering. This was something that a single collective farm could not accomplish alone, so they combined the resources of several collective farms to undertake these projects. This made their resources very substantial, and what could they not achieve? Because machines could reduce labor, the labor saved could be used for other tasks. And the time saved could be used to seek knowledge and learning. Now, the Free Village Elementary School run by Village Head Zhu still operated like he did as a village teacher more than a decade ago, still not having summer or winter vacations, but rather having school holidays during the busy farming seasons, still called "agricultural vacation." This practice was imitated by other villages as well. Not only other villages, but even rural areas in other provinces imitated this. This agricultural vacation has become popular in rural areas throughout China, and the trend was started by the one-armed principal, Zhu Laoyuan. In addition, because many rural people had lost the opportunity to study, some who had never studied and others who had lost their education during the war, he established many supplementary schools. Whether male or female, he believed that being able to learn a little would always be beneficial, both publicly and privately. It is precisely that:</p>
<p>Only through diligent practice does one overcome clumsiness; one must know that learning can make up for wasted time. (108)</p>
<h3>The Pork Market in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Pork is one of the main food sources for us Chinese, so butcher shops in Shanghai are prevalent in every vegetable market and on every street throughout the city. Here, I, the author, will record the current state of the pork market as follows:</p>
<p>Sources of Pork in Shanghai: The vast majority of Shanghai's fresh pork comes from the two ports of Tiansheng and Qinglong in northern Jiangsu. The next largest source is from Wenzhou and Taizhou, followed by Pudong and the Suzhou-Wuxi area. However, this was the case before the "August 13th" incident. After the Shanghai Battle, due to the intermittent disruption of transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang, and the difficulty of freight transport, this source of supply was cut off. Furthermore, the Pudong and Suzhou-Wuxi areas experienced frequent guerrilla warfare, causing unrest among the people and reducing sideline production, so very little cargo arrived in Shanghai. Therefore, the current source of pork in Shanghai is, in fact, limited to northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>Sales Volume: During the peak period of meat consumption before the war, the daily sales volume of pork in Shanghai was approximately 5,000 to 8,000 or 9,000 head. During the lean periods (i.e., the hot summer months and the Double Ninth Festival), it was only 400 or 500 head per day. On average, it was 2,300 head per day. After the Shanghai Battle, due to the decrease in the supply of fresh pork and the increase in demand, prices rose repeatedly. However, since pork prices were so high, naturally, except for a portion of wealthy citizens and for essential weddings and funerals, the vast majority of the petty bourgeoisie would no longer make pork a regular dish at home. Therefore, even though only 2,000 or 3,000 head of fresh pork arrive in Shanghai daily after the war, due to the inability of most citizens to afford meat, this so-called "peak period" has not seen panic buying, except for the special circumstances of these past few days.</p>
<p>Disappearance of Fresh Pork: Since the "control" of pigs began, it has aroused strong opposition from the entire city's fresh meat industry, leading to the monopoly and exploitation of fresh pork sources. As a result, fresh pork has disappeared from the market. According to investigations, the minimal amount of fresh pork on the market these days is transported from the Pudong area, with only twenty to forty head arriving daily. How can this possibly meet the needs of customers in the city? However, all the fresh pork merchants and butchers in the city are determined to resist the oppression of this special force and adhere to a policy of non-cooperation to the end. They—everyone who runs a fresh meat shop and a pig brokerage—feels that they have been exploited too severely, and are in too much pain. For each pig transported from Nantong to Shanghai via Tiansheng Port, a certain party used to collect as much as 9.5 yuan in various levies on land and water. Now, when entering Shanghai, that certain party wants to add a unified tax of three yuan per head, and also control the business hub of the city's fresh meat market. Therefore, if they were to endure this, not only would that certain party take an inch and then a mile, pressing on step by step, but their livelihood would be completely strangled! Therefore, they would rather temporarily suspend business and suffer this huge loss, and fight to the end!</p>

<h3>Casual Musings of a Hat-Wearing Guest</h3>
<p>— Xiao Cang</p>
<p>Huang Runfu Unexpectedly Wins Applause</p>
<p>Huang Runfu, a famous Jing (painted face) actor in the late Qing Dynasty, was called "Huang San" by the people of the capital. He was able to perform a wide variety of operas and was highly regarded for his portrayal of Cao Cao, earning him the title of "Living Cao Cao." His performances in plays such as "Yangping Pass," "Battle of Wancheng," "Changban Slope," and "Catching and Releasing Cao Cao" were all outstanding. Tan Xinpei and Yang Xiaolou, who had long been leading figures in the opera world, both relied on Huang Runfu as their right and left hand. In the early years of the Republic, I had the opportunity to see Huang Runfu perform in the opera "Stealing the Imperial Horse" with Yang Xiaolou in the old capital. Yang Xiaolou's Tianba and Huang Runfu's Chief Dou of the Village were undoubtedly unmatched at the time. With Wang Changlin as Zhu Guangzu, Qian Jinfu as Guan Tai, Bao Jixiang as Peng Gong, Xu Deyi as the Big Boss, and Liu Yanting as Xiang Lutong, the performance was even more splendid. However, at that time, Huang San was already old and frail, and his front teeth had fallen out, so his lines were inevitably airy. The audience, however, thought his painted face was excellent and his bearing and presence were extraordinary, so they greeted his every move with applause, which was enough to show his charm in old age. That day, the performance started with Dou Erdun setting up his village and stealing the horse. The boots that Huang San was wearing were old items that had been used for many years and were in very poor condition. Due to the force he exerted in the scene of stealing the horse, his sole suddenly separated from the boot surface when he struck a pose. The sole fell to the ground with a loud thud. The audience was not at all surprised and greeted it with a round of applause, knowing that the costumes he used were all items from twenty or thirty years ago, and they would not despise him because his sole had fallen off. If this situation were seen in Shanghai, it would probably lead to heckling or derisive laughter.</p>
<p>Yang Xiaolou Quite Willing to Admit Excellence</p>
<p>Yang Xiaolou created a generation of masters in the field of Wu Sheng (martial male) roles. Although his Wu Sheng style followed the tradition of Lao Yu (Yu Shuting), his singing, dialogue, and expressions also drew from his father, Yuelou. He was able to extract the essence of both the Yu and Yang styles and incorporate his own ideas. When he performed on stage, he was neither lukewarm nor overly enthusiastic, striving for naturalness and being extraordinary. My friend Mr. Yang and Xiaolou are very close friends, and they talk about everything. According to Mr. Yang, Xiaolou, although he sings Wu Sheng roles, is quite willing to admit excellence in the performing arts. After the Republic, in plays such as "Golden Money Leopard" and "Yan Yangqi," Yu Zhenting was able to excel with his fierce bravery, which perfectly matched the characters in the plays. He usually said that these two plays were Xiaoyu's (Yu Zhenting) forte, and he would not perform them unless the theater owner specifically requested it. Also, Shang Heyu's "Siping Mountain" was extremely famous. Although Xiaolou had this play, he only performed "Jinyang Palace" and was unwilling to lightly perform "Siping Mountain." Also, Xiaolou's "Five Righteous Men" was truly a good performance, but because Wang Changlin was highly regarded for this play in the old capital, he was also unwilling to often perform "Five Righteous Men." All of these are clear evidence of his willingness to admit excellence and hide his own strengths. Also, Xiaolou heard in the eleventh year of the Republic that Mei Lanfang, Yu Shuyan, and Yang Xiaolou each occupied a stage, competing with each other. But during a certain period, Xiaolou's audience attendance was not as good as Lanfang's and Shuyan's. Some people backstage were criticizing Xiaolou, which Xiaolou happened to overhear. Xiaolou then instructed the backstage to announce "Lin Chong Flees at Night." Once the posters were out, it caused a sensation in the nine cities. When the performance came, the whole city turned out, with a grand scene of tens of thousands of people emptying their houses. The public opinion began to believe that Xiaolou's performing arts were indeed extraordinary, and the theater owner was also overjoyed.</p>
<p>Yu and Zhou Co-star in "Eight Great Hammers"</p>
<p>When Yu Shuyan was invited to Shanghai's Dan Gui First Stage in the eighth year of the Republic, he co-starred in the opera "Eight Great Hammers." Because the stage did not have a famous Wu Sheng to play the role of Lu Wenlong, the first part of Lu Wenlong, fighting four generals, was played by Jin Lianshou from the company, and when telling the story, Lu Wenlong was played by Qilin Tong. I personally listened to it, and Jin Lianshou's fighting four generals was indeed not good, and Qilin Tong's Lu Wenlong in the storytelling scene also slipped up three times, presumably due to temporary cramming.</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng Quite Knows How to Remember the Past</p>
<p>Liu Hongsheng came from a humble background, but when performing operas, he quite knows how to remember the past. The supporting actors he brought, the painted face Mei Rongzhai, the Qingyi Wu Caixia, and the old Dan Chen Wenqi, he never changed his supporting actors. Compared to today's leading actors who often throw tantrums and have conflicts with their supporting actors, leading to their departure, Hongsheng's personality is truly commendable.</p>
<p>Wang Qichang—a pillar of the Daxin Grand Theater. He is skilled in civil and martial roles, and also performs Hong Sheng (red face) roles. Plays such as "Zhou Yu Returns to Heaven," "Royal Stele Pavilion," "Marquis of Hanshou Pavilion," and "Golden Money Leopard" are all his masterpieces. The play "Golden Money Leopard" is especially praised. Now I have found a photo of him in the play "Shui Lian Dong," and I am submitting it to the "Entertainment World" of the Shen Bao for the enjoyment of fellow enthusiasts. Recognized by the Master of Fuyun Pavilion.</p>
<h3>"Shanghai Drama Arts Society" to Become a Professional Theater Group</h3>
<p>Location—Xuangong Ballroom</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drama Arts Society is going to become a professional theater group. Do you find it strange? There's no need to be surprised. If there can be strict management and a reasonable organization, a professional theater group is no worse than an amateur one. You can see this by looking at the past amateur experimental theater groups.</p>
<p>This decision for the Drama Arts Society to become a professional theater group has been planned for a long time, and now it has finally been mostly determined.</p>
<p>The location of the theater has been decided as the Xuangong Ballroom. They only need to flatten the floor and widen the stage.</p>
<p>The current Xuangong will move to Lafayette Garden, because there is a garden there that is much better than Xuangong. The investors are now working to proceed, and it can be realized with roughly a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p>This plan can be completely resolved by the end of this month at the latest, and performances can begin at Xuangong from the first of next month. Initially, they only plan to perform daytime shows, not evening shows. When the weather cools down, they will perform both morning and evening shows.</p>
<p>The professionalized Shanghai Drama Arts Society will certainly meet us with a newer appearance. Fortunately, the time is not far off, and we will wait and see.</p>
<p>A Snapshot of the Dance World (22)</p>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<h3>Trace</h3>
<p>There are truly more and more dance halls being established in Shanghai, and few are sparsely attended. Could it be that these refugees who have fled here have the leisure and inclination to do so? Could it be that with the country in such a state, they still have the heart to seek pleasure and enjoyment? I often think of these questions and ask my friends, but my friends retort, "Aren't you a refugee who fled from Changshu to here? Don't you claim to be an ambitious person?" I don't know what to say in response. Even if I ask myself, I don't know the reason. In short, it's just to relieve boredom and ease the troubles.</p>
<p>In recent months, I have visited the Great World twice, and both times it was packed to the rafters. Two rows of tables have been added in front of the music stage. One time, Gong Qiuxia and her group sang all the songs from the film "Song and Tears of a Singer." When a line of stars sang the final song on the music stage, it did indeed attract the attention of all the dancers and dance hostesses. Apart from the singing and musical accompaniment, no other noise was heard. Mei Lanfang once told me that whether a drama is wonderful or not cannot be judged by the cheers and applause from the audience. The most important thing for a famous actor is to hold the audience, making them silent and without noise, which is called "镇场" (zhengchang - holding the stage). That day, these young ladies, wearing the same homespun clothes, gently parted their pearly lips and softly sang new songs, so they were also able to "镇场." As soon as one song ended, a beautiful young lady suddenly ran to my seat. After a long greeting, I, clumsy as I am, really couldn't remember her name, but listening to her voice, Qian Tang's Su Xiao is a fellow villager, I can definitely say with no doubt. Another time, it was a dance competition, but I dare not compliment it, and according to several dance stars, although there were many people, business was rather slow. Although the hall reaped the benefits of the late hours (桑榆之效), whether it could compensate for the losses of the day (东隅之失) seemed to require some calculation.</p>
<p>I've also been to Dahua twice. The Dragon Outfit has been cancelled. Opening the windows facing the street is still a bit cool. It seems that there is not much change. The performances have been cancelled, and the box office is still not bad. I went to the nightclub next door to Hollywood for the night dance. The location is very quiet, and the music stand only has three performers, but it is very clear and pleasant to listen to. It is said that it only gets crowded after midnight. When we went, it was around nine or ten o'clock, and we almost monopolized a table. All the dancers were foreigners. According to the waiters, you have to call them to sit at your table before you can dance with them, but sitting at the table doesn't require a dance ticket, just pay for the drinks.</p>
<p>Hui Deng is also on the western section of Yu Yuan Road. We went there around 11 o'clock, and there were not many customers yet. The Pingguo game (fruit machine) area was very crowded. I met my old friend Mr. Jianfei, and learned that he was also a shareholder. I played four yuan and won once, getting three yuan, so it was still worth it. The music was not very good, and the dance hostesses were not very selected.</p>
<p>Another day, I went to Dadu and Paramount with accountant Pan and Mr. Zhang Guyu, and they were both as before. Lu Mei, etc., were already dancing at Paramount. Lu Mei said that because Dadu inevitably suffers disasters in the summer, Paramount has air conditioning, so that's why she's here. The leader of the Paramount orchestra always felt very lacking to me, so I asked Guyu, "What's the good of going to dance halls anyway?" He said, "If you don't go, what's good?" This is just going with the flow.</p>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Brutal Act of Warlords Killing Actors</p>
<p>Therefore, Lao Chu arrived there only to find nothing. However, he had already learned about the matter, and with his impetuous temperament, he didn't care whether it was true or not. He immediately issued an order and sent a platoon of men to the theater where Gao and Liu were performing to arrest them. Pity the two men, Han Chen and San Kui, who were still performing on stage when these wolf-like soldiers rushed onto the stage and tied them up. The Gao and Liu families were in a flurry, urgently asking people to rescue them and telegraphing King Mei, asking him to plead with Lu Zhang for help. Who knew that Lao Chu, before Zhang's telegram arrived, had already added the charge of being "reds" and shot the two men. His own wife initiated the affair, luring someone into a trap, but not only did he let the culprit go unpunished, but he also brutally killed the passive participants for no reason. Only warlords of the past could have done such a thing. Before long, the Zhili-Lu armies failed, and Chu was buried alive in a pile of earth by Liu Zhennian, which was also the retribution for his cruelty and bloodthirstiness.</p>
<p>Lao Chu originally did not much approve of actors. The reason for this is quite ridiculous. Originally, he was from a bandit background, and Chinese dramas always portray bandits in a manner that does not resemble human beings. The painted faces they use are also similar to monsters, and the leaders of the bandits always end up being killed. Therefore, he disliked the "Eight Great Captures" and similar plays the most. Since he shot Liu and Gao, he hated actors even more. Sometimes when he met these people in front of Zhang Changtui, he always ignored them. If someone wanted to ingratiate himself with him and chat with him, he would immediately put on a sullen face and say, "Here you are showing off, you actors." In the end, no one dared to talk to him. From this, it can be seen that although he came from the same background as Changtui, the two men's temperaments were vastly different. One greatly supported actors, while the other brutally killed them. This was even more diametrically opposed. (10)</p>

<p>Horse Eight Advances Seven Cannon Eight Advances Four Cannon Eight Advances Two Elephant Three Advances Five Pawn Three Advances One Explanation From Cannon Two Moves to Five and Horse Two Moves to Three, this remains a Screen Horse against Central Cannon configuration. However, with the Red side's imminent attacking position, the Black side does not immediately advance Rook Two to Six, but first advances Pawn Seven to One, a slow-advancing strategy focused not on direct attack. The advance of Pawn Seven to One is solely to prevent the opponent from further advancing Pawn Three to One, restricting the Black horse's path, and thus remains a critical move.</p>
<p>Horse Eight Advances Seven This black advances not the rook as there is no clear path of advancement, there is no need to act rashly, the raising of the horse indicating the intent to move the ninth rank rook, the cannon advances eight and four to raise the cannon with the intent of pressuring the rook.

<p>Rehashing Old News (27)</p>
<h3>British Envoy Observes the Japanese Emperor</h3>
<p>(See this newspaper from May of the 11th year of the Xuantong Emperor of the late Qing Dynasty) When a subject meets his ruler, the etiquette must be fixed. Speaking of bowing and scraping, the solemnity of the ancient ruler and subject meeting between the Yin steps can be known. Although heaven and earth are determined in Western countries, the etiquette is very simple. When they perform grand ceremonies, they kneel on one knee to the ruler, and the ruler raises them with his hand. If it is an ordinary audience, the ruler sits while the subject stands. When meeting envoys from other countries, they rise from their seats to show humility; because the envoy originally represents the ruler of the country, so-called "completely and minutely." The custom of Western countries has always been like this, and recently they also want to implement it in Japan. Initially, when the King of Japan received the American envoy, he received him sitting high. When he was about to meet the British envoy Watson, he also wanted to use this as an example, but the British envoy debated and clarified repeatedly, saying that if Japan did this to the British envoy, Britain would also do this to the Japanese envoy, so the King of Japan followed his advice. Watson's insistence on maintaining the general situation can also be said to be not disgracing his mission.</p>
<h3>French Envoy Arrives in Tianjin</h3>
<p>The newly appointed French Envoy Extraordinary to the Capital, Adult Qi Afei, arrived at Tianjin on the 22nd of last month. Duke Li met him with a dignified demeanor and clear speech. He is truly a world-saving talent and a choice for the flourishing of China.</p>
<h3>Throwing Birds</h3>
<p>The other day, I happened to go out of the north city and passed through the Simaoge Bridge to Caishi Street, and saw a servant in a chicken and duck shop with a murderous face, holding live quail and turtledoves, throwing them hard on the ground. There were definitely one or two hundred of them being thrown, but none of them died immediately. Their eyes rolled, and their wings and feet contracted. I learned that they were all for the needs of restaurants, and the price was only dozens to hundreds of copper coins per bird. I couldn't help but feel sad! It was a pity that I didn't have any money and couldn't buy them to save them. I returned home and had restless dreams for several nights!</p>
