<p>該負担的財政支出，實在九十億以上。</p>
<p>日本從七，七以來，到本年度爲止，其消耗的戰費，除</p>
<p>普通會計不計，總額已達七十四億之鉅，此數字，幾乎是</p>
<p>全靠着公債來彌補的。因此，要估量明年日本財政的破落</p>
<p>情形，只要估量過去的籌劃公債情形，就可以見到大概。</p>
<p>日本的發行公債方法，到現在爲止，可以說已經是增發</p>
<p>紙幣的另一方式。本年度日本應發的公債，爲六十餘億，</p>
<p>但是到了去年十一月底爲止、已消化的公債，只有三十六</p>
<p>億，而其中，經各銀行保險公司等買去的又有二十八億</p>
<p>，其餘都在日本銀行的手中。各銀行保險公司的購買公債</p>
<p>，也不是因爲日本富力的增加。統計數字上指出，日本最</p>
<p>近存欵總額，因通貨膨脹的結果、雖然比以前增多，但是</p>
<p>其放欵的數字、却相對的激减，可見日本各銀行與保險公</p>
<p>司購買公債的力量，全是從放欽部份移過來的。換言之，</p>
<p>日本各銀行與保險公司的承購公偵己侵入到其可運用的力</p>
<p>量以內，不過是在政府的强迫下，沒有方法拒購吧了。</p>
<p>縱然在强迫的情勢下，日本應發的公債，也只發行了一</p>
<p>部份，而日本國家銀行所保有的公債額，還是一天天增加</p>
<p>起來。日本銀行這時應付的方法，單純的是增加紙幣。這</p>
<p>從日本最近紙幣的發行收攬形上看，就可以知道。</p>
<p>日本紙幣的發行方法，向來分兩部份，一部份是是金準備</p>
<p>，一部份是保證準備。在戰前，日本銀行保有的黃金是五</p>
<p>億圓，而保證準備名下的發行限度爲十億圓，因此日本銀</p>
<p>行的紙幣發行額，大的爲十五億圓左右。開戰以後，日本</p>
<p>不久即舉行黃金估值，把日本銀行所有的黃金，因提高估</p>
<p>價之故，從五億圓擴大到十餘億圓。在此項估值之後，日</p>
<p>本紙幣發行下所有的黃金，虛僞地擴大到八億圓，其大部</p>
<p>份的黃金，則借了「特別會計」的名義，輸到海外去作購買</p>
<p>原料之用，實際上這是增加發行的另一套戲法。</p>
<p>一方面用偸天換日的手段，把黃金估價提高，來擴大金</p>
<p>準備名下的紙幣發行，另一方面又把保證準備發行的公債</p>
<p>，從十億圓擴大到十七億圓，使日本銀行可以多買一些公</p>
<p>債。從這時候起，日本銀行的發行額，已從過去十七億，</p>
<p>擴大到二十五億了。</p>
<p>因了公債消化的困難，日本紙幣的發行，日益膨脹，同</p>
<p>時因了國內物資的恐慌，不能不再輸出黃金！於是日本銀</p>
<p>行所保有的黃金，不能不再輪出，這就是去年六月間以外</p>
<p>匯基金名義而輪出的三億圓黃金。從那時候起，黃金準備</p>
<p>是减下了，可是紙幣的發行並不减少。</p>
<p>到了去年年末，因了財政上用度擴大等種種因素，日本</p>
<p>的紙幣曾經擴大到二十八億。依照日本現有的保證準備，</p>
<p>只允許十七億，而黃金準備只有五億，那末，日本銀行的</p>
<p>總發行限度，總計是二十二億，現在發行到二十八億，不</p>
<p>是超出限度有六億圓之多嗎？不就是等於日本銀行發不出</p>
<p>去的公債數額嗎？</p>
<p>實際上日本國內的黃金，有無早成問題，我們就使相信</p>
<p>其有，但照上面所說，日本的增發公債，已到了強迫購買</p>
<p>的最高限度，今後的趨勢，不過是直截增加紙幣的發行吧</p>
<p>了。濫發紙幣，就是用白紙來掠奪民力，也就是表示財政</p>
<p>上的最末一條路！</p>
<h3>津市民四百八十二人　聯名向英大使呼籲</h3>

<p>甘願忍受一切艱苦支持神聖抗戰</p>
<p>英大使已自津抵平</p>
<p>香港　津訊、天津市民</p>
<p>四百八十二人、四日聯名</p>
<p>致函英大使卡爾、對此决</p>
<p>北來、致歡迎詞與敬意、幷</p>
<p>表示華北民衆之意志、與</p>
<p>對英國之願望、原函云、卡</p>
<p>爾先生、我們是天津的市</p>
<p>民、對于友邦英國大使、不</p>
<p>辭辛勞、遠道光臨天津視</p>
<p>察、謹申最誠摯的歡迎與</p>
<p>敬意、先生來到天津、已經</p>
<p>踏入華北第一步、我們很</p>
<p>覺幸慰、因爲先生可以代</p>
<p>表友邦英國政府與人民對</p>
<p>于日本發動武力侵略戰爭</p>
<p>以後的華北觀察、認識更</p>
<p>可眞切、關于日本自從蘆</p>
<p>溝橋事變、直到今日、在華</p>
<p>北怎樣蹂躪我們的領土、</p>
<p>殺戮我們的同胞、破壞我</p>
<p>們的建設、驅逐歐美的商</p>
<p>業、這一切事實、先生平時</p>
<p>一定可從貴國領事署與駐</p>
<p>軍方而得到許多報吿、最</p>
<p>近日本口口聲聲呌囂、要</p>
<p>取消租界、進而己經實施、</p>
<p>把天津租界封鎖了、只要</p>
<p>先生到租界周圍巡視一决</p>
<p>、就可知道英國租界以內</p>
<p>的數十萬中外居民、一千</p>
<p>餘貴國駐軍的嚴重遭遇、</p>
<p>我們今天不再向先生貢獻</p>
<p>任何資料、只對先生簡單</p>
<p>提供幾點、表示華北民衆</p>
<p>的態度、與對先生的願望、</p>
<p>第一、我們擁護我們的政</p>
<p>府、擁護最高領袖蔣委員</p>
<p>長、我們甘願忍受一切艱</p>
<p>苦、支持神聖抗戰、直到中</p>
<p>國驅盡敵人、獲得最後勝</p>
<p>利、華北民衆决不向日本</p>
<p>投降、更不承認日本所卵</p>
<p>翼的一切漢奸紐織、日本</p>
<p>軍閥爲要掩飾强盜行爲、</p>
<p>麻醉中國人心、僱了少數</p>
<p>漢奸、担任僞官名義、但是</p>
<p>這些漢好、都是我們政府</p>
<p>與人民平日共棄的敗類、</p>
<p>所以一舉一動、决不能代</p>
<p>表中國人民的意志、先生</p>
<p>可以知道、只短短的本年</p>
<p>的第一個月內、華北民衆</p>
<p>由天津秘密匯往內地轉匯</p>
<p>重慶的國民獻金、已有一</p>
<p>百二十批之多、自從開戰</p>
<p>以後、華北民衆、每月內</p>
<p>都有獻金匯給我們的政府</p>
<p>、這些獻金、是華北貧富</p>
<p>居民商家工人學生婦孺苦</p>
<p>力零整凑集起來的、我</p>
<p>們僅爲說明我們擁護政府</p>
<p>擁護蔣委員長擁護抗戰、</p>
<p>自然可以說明我們意志的</p>
<p>事實、還有極多、這不過</p>
<p>其一而已、關於最近日方</p>
<p>所宣傳之「和平運動」、</p>
<p>我們願有聲明、中國自古</p>
<p>卽爲愛好和平之民族、愛</p>
<p>好和平、爲我國之美德、</p>
<p>「九一八」以後、日本佔</p>
<p>我東北四省、繼而迫我簽</p>
<p>訂塘沽協定、侵略察北冀</p>
<p>東、製造河北事件、凡中國</p>
<p>政府所能容讓者、一再忍</p>
<p>辱呑聲、今茲戰事爆發、實</p>
<p>乃日本迫我起而抵抗、爲</p>
<p>求生存而抗戰、故人民甘</p>
<p>願忍受一切艱難痛苦、擁</p>
<p>護政府抗戰到底、至勝利</p>
<p>爲止、此可證明最近之所</p>
<p>謂「和平運動」、並無絲毫</p>
<p>民意、完全乃日本嗾使僞</p>
<p>組織所導演、第二、我們要</p>
<p>請先生相信日本在一年零</p>
<p>七個月以來、費盡人力財</p>
<p>力火力、在華北僅佔據鐵</p>
<p>道錢上的九個都市縣鎭、</p>
<p>換言之、日本沒有能力佔</p>
<p>領交通錢以外的城鄉、這</p>
<p>些一城鄕、華北頒土的大部</p>
<p>份、仍在我們政府統轄之</p>
<p>下、我們有力量防禦、並未</p>
<p>陷入敵手、而且這些區域、</p>
<p>已經逐漸擴至交通錢上、</p>
<p>到最近爲止北平□□的□</p>
<p>已有我們武裝完備之軍</p>
<p>隊　萬人、熱察邊境及□</p>
<p>□□一帶、有口萬人、河北</p>
<p>省津浦平漢兩綫之間的□</p>
<p>□□□□□□□有□萬人</p>
<p>、晋冀察邊區的□□□□</p>
<p>□□有□萬人、共餘冀東</p>
<p>冀南魯北魯西、無一縣是</p>
<p>被日軍完全佔領的、至於</p>
<p>山西全省·河南北部、更無</p>
<p>一處不是布滿我們有组織</p>
<p>的英勇的國軍、另一事實、</p>
<p>更足證明日本無力統治任</p>
<p>何佔領區、日方發行之「聯</p>
<p>合準備銀行」之偽鈔、行使</p>
<p>之範圍、祇爲鐵道錢上之</p>
<p>少數城市、鐵道錢十里以</p>
<p>外之地方、偽鈔卽成廢紙、</p>
<p>凡此亦證明華北民衆對日</p>
<p>本與僞組織之决不屈服、</p>
<p>第三、我們希望友邦英國、</p>
<p>爲正義、爲人道、爲世界和</p>
<p>平、爲英國在遠東權益、對</p>
<p>中國的抗戰、給我們以更</p>
<p>多的同情、我們相信中國</p>
<p>本身的國力、可以單獨戰</p>
<p>勝日本、我們的信念、與我</p>
<p>們戰塲官兵、及後方民衆</p>
<p>相同、與先生在重慶昆明</p>
<p>所見的中國朝野無異、便</p>
<p>是日本頑暴的侵略、必遭</p>
<p>失敗、中國的正義抗戰、總</p>
<p>獲勝利、但是我們自知、中</p>
<p>國獨力對日作戰、最後勝</p>
<p>利、雖必屬中國、而過程將</p>
<p>極慘苦、若要等到完全用</p>
<p>我們本身力量擊敗日本、</p>
<p>英國在遠東的商業、恐怕</p>
<p>也被日本先破壞無餘了、</p>
<p>先生是中國之友、是英國</p>
<p>最同情中國的人士之一、</p>
<p>我們敢請先生在這决視察</p>
<p>華北之後、更熱心的代中</p>
<p>國向貴國呼籲、使用貴國</p>
<p>一切可以給我們的廣大的</p>
<p>同情、這不僅是爲帮忙中</p>
<p>國、也爲維謢貴國在遠東</p>
<p>的利權、最後我們覺得慚</p>
<p>愧、先生首次來律、我們却</p>
<p>不能看到我們的政府機關</p>
<p>來對先生作盛大的歡迎、</p>
<p>但是我們相信、兩年以後、</p>
<p>至多三年、先生重遊天津</p>
<p>時、應可隨處看到靑天白</p>
<p>日的中國國旗、並且接受</p>
<p>我們政府的隆重招待了、</p>
<p>敬祝先生旅途健康、天津</p>

<h3>夫婦知識</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚祟培　性病專科醫師詹念曾　合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時　星期日休息</p>
<p>一歲之計在於春</p>
<p>爲腎虧男子作終生打算</p>
<p>立春了！春確已偷偷地來到了人間，這不特時序是這樣的推移，就是在人們受暖和的陽光照在因寒冷而已民萎縮了的面皮上露出了笑容該可以看到。呀！春眞的來了！的確可以使人驚喜！可是春來了，一年之計在於春，關於你的前途與幸福，就應得在這時作一翻打算。健康是我們前途與幸福的基礎，我們遠大的前程，更必須以此爲出發，如果健康喪失，所謂皮之不存，毛將焉附？這實是我們唯一要緊的事。可是做了一個男子在當今動亂的充滿色情的社會裏，對於健康常發生了問題。最普遍而也最痛苦的就是男子於婚後發現腎虧與性弱等毛病。我們試想一個女郎嫁了一個丈夫，她是爲什麽的？不過性的問題須由夫婦之道來解決，這是正規。誰不願意正正堂堂的來要求人生應有的幸福？所以一個健壯男子娶了這種憧憬社會的女郎，沒有不愛情濃厚，夫婦生活纏綣而甜蜜，享受著人生正規的幸福的。要是男子於早年犯了自凟與遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，那主宰人體健康的生死腺液勢必枯竭，即暴發腎虧無能，精力渙散，久婚不育，局部萎縮，神經衰弱等症，是以時覺頭昏腦脹，健忘失眠，耳鳴眼花，腰酸背痛，四肢無力，如稍一操作，即覺疲憊不堪！年齡尚輕，已呈衰邁狀態。此種男子，雖終日安坐而食，猶奄奄一息，將如何能與人爭雄逐勝？在學術與事業上謀有所成就？即在夫婦生活上，亦不能盡丈夫應有之職責，所以常爲妻痛恨，造成家庭的悲慘！甚或子女無出，貽終生之大憾！如此人生，尚有何意義！所以時屆立春，爲一歲之計，也是爲終生打算，必須謀求方法，務期速即治愈此種惡疾才好。此據世界名醫及余個人經騐，均公認以服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」最爲對症而特效。誠以此藥於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，病勢即可減輕，如繼續服用，必可於短期內使上述各症根本痊愈，惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以鞏固精關，解除腎虧神經過敏狀態，則遺精方可澈底治愈，並標本兼治，收效更可神速！上述藥品均經多數中外醫師臨床診實騐，證明其功效確切偉大，所以早已風行全球，各藥房均售了。但患者能親來本診所就專家醫師診斷後，施用電療，注射與其他對症療法，則更可保證根治。</p>
<p>青年通病</p>
<h3>春日的遺精影響如何</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>『斬草不除根，逢春必發青』，春天雖然是一個美麗溫馨的季節，可是有了宿疾的人，一到了這個時候，卻每每容易舊病復發，或甚至加劇起來。</p>
<p>現在姑以遺精一症來說罷，遺精在冬天，因爲氣候寒冷，夜間雖擁重要，還覺得畏畏縮縮，兩隻腳　不肯向下直伸，蜷曲著似一隻刺蝟（睡時灣曲，亦能減少遺精，）這時的夢幻既少，誘發的機會自然不多，故遺洩的次數，便也相當減少，可是一到了春季，這就大不相同了，因爲春天是萬物萌芽的時候，也可以說由潛伏而蠢蠢思動的時候，這時的天氣既逐漸的溫暖了，春夢也特別的多，更兼生理上也有著相當轉變，於是觸景生情，隨時都有誘發青年思凟而更增劇其遺精，</p>
<p>遺精的次數既頻，生理上所產生的精血，當然不專營新陳代謝之用，於是頭暈目眩，耳鳴心悸，腰痠背痛，記憶薄弱，思想不能集中等症相繼叢生，如果當此時期而猶不急謀補救，那麽症勢必益見惡化，遂影響及於性神經，而爆發局部的麻痺，或過敏，或竟至於完全無能，如此青年，不特於自身的健康學業，毫無保障，即於將來的夫婦生活上，亦必無法履行其天職，而致發生種種不幸的慘劇！</p>
<p>總之，遺精的弊害，一言難盡，故當此春到人間之初，患有斯疾者，應迅即施以挽救，挽救之法，一方可服『希米脫氏固精片』，鞏固其精關，消滅射精中樞神經的過敏狀態，一方尤須提高意志，避免不良的接觸，勤運動，臨睡前以冷水摩擦局部，注意排尿，誠能照此實行，則春夢無論怎樣多，也不致再有遺洩，若因遺洩過久而已有各種衰弱症象者，那可同時以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』爲培補，則一日夜間自能生精强腎，健腦益髓，如果連續服用，擔保可以在最短期內，恢復健壯，</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>多情女郎（必然乳峯）聳起</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚祟培</p>
<p>美國婦女生理學大家Dimkarss苗卡斯博士說：「多情女郎必然乳峯聳起」。在初頗引起許多人的懷疑，後來他著作了一篇「乳峯與愛情」刊在著名的雜誌中，說明婦女乳峯的發育是完全根據於卵巢機能的健全，因爲卵巢機能主濁婦女性機能的總樞。這種性機能旺盛，在體內就產生多量的內分泌。這種內分泌能促進女性特徵的發達，是以在體態方面，最顯著的就是乳峯高聳起來。乳頭呈紫檀色，猶如椎形山峯上的塔頂，因此，在胸際雙峯雙峙，中間是幽深的凹處，這是多麽健美而引人心醉！在感情方面，亦因內分泌的刺激之故，常致感情豐富而呈優柔，溫和，快樂，敏感與多情等現象。這種女郎，才是男性典型的心目中的愛人，家庭中的賢妻良母。……自這種原理闡發之後，大家始相信女性乳峯，不特在健美上有價值，即在內心的感情上亦大有關係。因此，歐美婦女，爲欲表明其健美與多情，對於乳峯發育，常加意維護。如有不甚滿意之處，即服卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」。以爲培補，務使其充分發育。可是我們回顧中國婦女，對於乳峯一項不特不注意其發育，甚至用束胸方法使其萎癟，此實不合理而愚蠢之至！至於因月經不調，白帶不感，及其他暗疾，致摧殘了卵巢機能，而乳癟顏衰，未老先衰者，那更比比皆是。是以在家庭裏即不免夫婦感情淡薄，貌合神雛，竟有夫妻而如寃家者。雖或一樣的也生男育女，這不過謬種流傳而已！如此情形，不特他們的自身痛苦之至，且於這會國家亦蒙莫大之害——唯一補救辦法，據世界名醫及余多年經騐，均以服用卵巢製劑女用「生殖素」，最爲對症而特效，因此劑於服後一日夜間即能培補卵巢機能，增進新陳代謝作用，如繼續服用，則於短期內即可將上述隱疾完全治愈。並可使乳峯聳起，面頰紅潤，增進健美與多情。</p>
<p>性病診療實錄</p>
<p>性病專科醫師詹念曾輯</p>
<p>（一）早婚戕傷幸獲根愈</p>
<p>患華龍泉，江蘇南通人，現年二十五，金融機關會計員，（主訴）——早婚之後，房勞過甚，致發育不全，腎虧腦弱，咳嗽咯血，（病歷）——華君先天本弱，更以父母溺愛，十六歲時即爲完婚，夫婦情愛彌篤，致房勞過甚，發育大受障礙，三四年後，自覺疲弱不堪，身體衰頽無力，記憶力銳減，然尚不知戒懼，未能即時清心寡慾，逐漸成腎虧之病，且咳嗽咯血，嗣續乃成絕望，去歲冬初，經同事鮑君之介紹，始投余處求治，（治療方法）——余以華君之病，在於發育尚未成熟之前，即縱慾無度，故生殖腺大受損傷，發育不全，身體虛弱，貧血早衰等症相繼發生，非服大量「生殖素」，不足以挽回頽勢，乃囑華君自向藥房購服。華君連服二月，各種症狀即一掃而空，萎靡不振之青年，竟一變而爲壯健逾恒的丈夫，今則神采飛逸，且其夫人已占夢蘭之兆云。</p>
<p>（二）性神經過敏的治愈</p>
<p>患韓國清，浙江寧波人，現年二十三，始於廿六年來滬經商，（主訴）—犯手淫多年，雖知其害，但因慾念過熾，不能戒絕，最近性神經愈見過敏，頗以爲苦，遺精滑精，性促疲勞，頭暈目眩，淫夢纏繞，（現在症狀）—局部發育不全，反射機能亢進，後尿道充血，又有高度神經衰弱症狀，（治療方法）—囑戒絕惡癖，行陰部陰外灌注法，末行後部尿道冷卻法，每日由余電療一次，並以『希米脫氏固精片』鞏固其精關，過敏性逐漸除去，同時以生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』消滅其高度神經衰弱症，經過極良好，約各服三盒，完全治愈，</p>

<h3>日軍厭戰</h3>
<p>江南造船所內　遍貼反戰標語</p>
<p>南市高昌廟江南造船所、爲日</p>
<p>淸公司佔據後、現改作日海軍</p>
<p>造船廠、已招工七八百名、而其</p>
<p>中領班、則盡爲日人、凡一百餘</p>
<p>人、此一百餘人、皆在本國應徵</p>
<p>兵役、因不願在前綫作戰、乃運</p>
<p>動此兵工職務、但有時因閒駐</p>
<p>已滿六月、或有過失、仍須調出</p>
<p>、無不痛哭、不料最近、該廠中</p>
<p>遍貼反戰及反軍閥之標語與傳</p>
<p>單、允以工廠中爲最多、經其上</p>
<p>級軍官到廠視察、發現此項情</p>
<p>事、乃大事所謂思想檢舉、故廠</p>
<p>內多數日兵及工八、均調往前</p>
<p>綫、</p>
<h3>日兵骨灰十三卡車　裝運回國</h3>

<p>公署』時代、上下開支、月需二</p>
<p>十八萬自改組爲僞『市府』後、</p>
<p>因傳筱庵亟圖擴張勢力、增至</p>
<p>四十八萬、本年度竟增至六十</p>
<p>萬、其遽增原因、係因僞「府『上</p>
<p>下、舞弊之風、日趨熾烈之故、</p>
<p>此决僞『維新政府』忍痛取消各</p>
<p>處僞『稅』對僞『府』方面、曾允</p>
<p>月貼四十萬元、但此項口頭敷</p>
<p>衍、將成泡影、因『維新』本身、</p>
<p>自顧尙不遑也、傳聞失望之訊、</p>
<p>猶圖開徵僞『地地稅』僞『營業</p>
<p>稅』、以資補救、但威嚇三月之』</p>
<p>土地呈報』、無人理會、僞『營業</p>
<p>稅』、因四郊工商、多未復業、亦</p>
<p>無把握、故二月份僞「經費』、（</p>
<p>大部爲僞員薪水）尙無着落、往</p>
<p>日僞『府』ｖ　餉亦有先後之爭、</p>
<p>僞財政局每月二十叫號首先發</p>
<p>給、僞『市府』爲二十五號、僞公</p>
<p>用局二十六號、其他偽『警局』</p>
<p>等爲二十八號、而附屬僞機關『</p>
<p>警察大隊』等、須至下月二三日</p>
<p>左有、向不公平、一般僞員、嘖</p>
<p>有煩言、幾將引起內江、今以本</p>
<p>月份僞餉均無着落、故大小傀</p>
<p>儡、焦急萬狀、</p>

<p>始將眞情吐露、並在身上抄出</p>
<p>秘密地址、及日人所出之運輸</p>
<p>公司通行證一紙、該隊士得供</p>
<p>後大爲憤怒、常塲將該犯顧正</p>
<p>華一名就地槍决、</p>

<p>續、蓋皆由於法租界住民激增</p>

<h3>金融　買氣益形逢勃　美匯破入十六元關　平津外行力吸不懈日商亦在暗中活動</h3>
<p>滙市昨以有利銀行仍代平津外商銀行界力吸不懈、兼日銀行亦暗中活動吸收、加以沙遜暨各大洋行等亦追隨扒結、故雖有港電與滙豐供塞維持、但以頭寸終屬扒過於售、致潛勢遂吿猛緊、英金最緊曾喊過八辦士一五六二五、美匯亦破入十六元大關、最軟亦曾呌過十五元九零六二五、港滙因銀行界買興蓬勃、狀况續軟、全天成交極旺、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠續漲、紐約銀價仍平、倫敦生金縮半辦士、匯兌英對美。對法。對滬均未更動、美對英升〇六二五、對法亦長〇二五、對滬平平、中央掛牌各滙呆定如故、銀行早開、現貨賣價、英滙八辦士二五、美匯十六元〇九三七五、較上週六午收英平、美硬〇三一二五、開後有利美行麥加利等爭先猛吸滙直與港電英金由八辦士二一八七五縮至二○三一二五、及美滙從十六元六二五緊至十六元、故狀况頗軟、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉大二五、計徵百分之五。二五、此後西商及美行亦來競結、兼銀行供意呆淡、致潛勢更緊、沙遜吸進有利·華比英滙八辦士二〇三一二五、權之再與美行結進安達。華比·荷蘭美滙十六元、近午美滙突破入十六元關口、緊至十五元九六八七五、至港滙因外行吃胃頗健、故亦趨緊、華義·荷蘭吸收錢兌業港滙五十四元八七五、</p>

<h3>津港幫紛起爭購　現金價復轉昂騰　最高又逹二零五七元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市重複轉漲、蓋歐洲局勢益見緩和、致外滙暗市緊勢頗厲、各方人心重見向榮津港兩帮暗中託某錢兌業力購不懈、加以本市殷富暨證券帮等追隨猛進、致雖有現金號與銀樓帮及錢兌業等吐售、然供求頭寸依然懸殊、故價格一度曾昂達二千〇五十七元高峯、結果軋漲九元、唯中途頗多盤旋、但尙無過大波瀾、交易尙旺、銀樓飾金亦隨之掛大一元、海關金暨中英純金等徵降、</p>
<p>烚赤抬漲九元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開賣價二千〇四十元、但未見做開、迨至九時五十分、首見某錢兌業進現金號五十兩、價二千〇三十九元、繼之證券帮進現金號五十兩、價四十元、後某錢兌業又進現金號五十兩、價則相同、（聞大致代本市殷富吸購）、此後因聞外匯受半津外銀行暗中傾扒、致潛勢頓見緊軟、乃引起另一錢兌業代津港兩帮猛進、故價亦隨之上升、另一錢兌業進現金號五十兩、價四十二元、其間賣戶均已束手旁觀、故另一錢兌業再進金號五十兩、價一躍爲四十六元、幸其時某銀樓忽代多戶獲利出籠、致漲風頓戢、另一錢兌業進某銀樓百兩、價四十五元及四十六元、此後某錢兌業亦代客帮出籠、故乃逐步回挫、售予金號五十兩、價四十六元、再售予另一錢兌業五十兩、價四十四元五角、又見某銀樓售予另一錢兌業五十兩、價四十四元、此後曾一度站定、至十一時光景、又見另一錢兌業進現金號五十兩、價四十二兀、最後又進現金號五十兩、價四十五元爲午收價、午後一時三刻、先見某錢兌業進同業五十兩、價四十七元、此後外滙受有利及洋行猛扒下、潛勢又見軟化、故塲中人心益加向榮、且津港兩帮暗中吸收頗力、加以售者多呈旁觀、故市價卽衝出五十元關、銀樓帮互做五十兩、價五十三元、金號進錢兌業五十兩、價五十五元、某錢兌業又進同業五十兩、五十七元爲最高價、此後因稍有多戶趁高了結、後乃回挫、銀樓帮售予錢兌業五十兩、價五十五元、及錢兌業互做五十兩、價五十三元、最後錢兌業又互做五十兩、二千〇五十四元爲晚收價、較上週六軋漲九元、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇六元、收進二千〇四十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金加大一元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初均未更動、迨至午後二時三十分、因烚赤又將逼近六十元關、故而隨之掛大一元、大同行老慶雲等改縣二百零八元、新同行懸二百〇六元、收逃二百元、</p>
<p>關金帶小一厘</p>
<p>中央銀行之中國現金收買價、近遠一千二百十二元八角、掛牌海關金亦低一厘、計二元三角九分六厘、上海標準標金價亦隨降四角、計達一千二百〇八元二角、乃四日倫敦電、英純金每盎司突縮半辦士所致云、</p>
<h3>殷富又向外幣進取　英美金鎊票激漲</h3>
<p>上週六英純金跌半辨士、英美匯兌未動、外歷暗市、縮風劇烈、勢甚虛弱、一時似難遏止、緣華北當局、破壞法幣、不遺餘力、今已定三月十日起、禁止流通、華北人民處威力之下、勢難反抗、殷富除將法幣輸送滬港外、紛將法幣兌取外滙或現金、是以外匯及現金需要激增、銀行及客帮向　購求不絕、本埠銀行賣意淡弱、供給困難、且洋行結款甚殷、雖港電供給尙旺、究難應浩大需索、故勢甚盧劇、給赤因滙票虛弱、天津帮吸胃健旺、市價逐步上漲、雖不乏獲利出籠、而金號錢兌業投機商力吸不懈、推波助瀾、藉圖漁利、誠令人心裂、外幣遇外滙虛弱烚赤高漲之助、闊步上升、復經殷富搜羅、昂貴愈甚、獲利售出者甚旺、不惜高價追求者更盛、勢甚鋒利、全日交易甚旺、公會交易亦盛、鼎元出永泰進英金票五十鎊、又出勤泰進英金票五十鎊、寶泰出同豐進英金票三十鎊、又出森泰進新加坡票五十元、永盛出勤泰進美金鎊二十個、寶祥出鴻昌進英金鎊六十個、鴻昌出晋大進美金鎊十個、昨日市價、英金鎊升三角、英金票升二角二分、美金鎊升六角、美金票升五分半、香港票升一分八厘、法郞票升一厘、新加坡票升三分、荷蘭票升二分、羅比票升二分半、坎拿大票升七分、斐律濱票升三分、澳金票升二角、僅安南票義大利票德金票還邏票未更、</p>
<h3>貼現步跌</h3>
<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率、跌勢漸銳、每千元初仍徘徊於三十五六元之間、正午爲三十五元半、至下午三十五元二角半、比上週六又低七角半云、</p>
<h3>證券　謠傳新借款成立　債市波動</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况起伏甚鉅、午前萎靡不振、午後忽有美國新借款成立之傳說、不營一服强心劑、頓轉激昂、所謂美國新借款雖有可能、但去事實尙遠、惟市上買氣頓盛、亦不可諱言、全日買賣雙方之可注意者、仍爲十號一本賣出初旨、繼續拋賣不絕、以及某銀行由五號代出現貨甚湧、漲風受其阻力不少、大戶賣出不止、漲風終屢有限也、</p>
<p>昨日龍過波動甚速、初以十五號代大戶補空、權以天生及樂茂號獨進甲種、趨勢甚堅、旋以價高、又引起十號之拋賣、勢已不振、五號再代金融界有現貨流出、回漲之勢、頓轉跌風、同時同康號雖吸收甚猛、惟以散戶亦有多頭出籠、終覺拉抬不起、多者回小一元之鉅、午後中美借款有新的成立之說、瀰漫市塲、漲風突起、二十號大戶補空、天生號多頭加碼、十號等賣出亦止、市氣蓬勃、多方驟佔優勢、各債均回高五六角、多日未有成交之丁種、祇有極少數成交、故比前獨漲</p>
<p>一元半、九六交易亦頗熱鬧、跌風即此而止、結果甲種尙微小一角半、餘大都回上三五角、丁種例外漲一元半、成交總數的計九十餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易又　沉悶、華商電氣股有極少數成交、價尙堅定、餘均在商討中、</p>
<p>本埠美商華美地產公司曾於一九三四年開發六厘公司債票國幣五十萬元、定期十年至三十年還淸、每年六月底及十二月底、各付利息一决、由本埠外灘廿六號揚子水火保險公司承募經理、茲悉該項債票、木月）二月）十四日起、發還債本百分之九十、並隨同給付還本部份之到期利息、計自本年一月一日起至還本開始日期止、共計四十五日、此項價票、去年十二月八日、曾按七折成交、最近曾有人出價九十九元二角五分買進云、</p>
<h3>紗花　實銷起色　棉紗漲風復熾　各紗昻起五六七元廠商又有大批開出</h3>
<p>紗市漲勢益劇、蓋以潮汕閩滇等處辦胃暢健、購買踴躍、一般同業鑒於環境好轉、亦跟踪而來、於是籌碼緊張、幸廠方趁漲時復來開售應付需求、市氣尙能抑平一步、然實需活潑、國戶得此扶植、意態更挺、二十支雙馬天女兩牌漲風獨熾、售價復至四百零三四元、比一月二十五日之頂高峯四百零六元、尙差二元、前途是否穿過前决之價、仍須恃客銷來推助也、</p>
<p>現紗市塲、晨開市氣尙平、变马开介漲二元、為四百元、然賣額殊微、成交三十包、係同業進、少頃福建帮實需起色、而買胃甚强、額量允宏、同時香港汕頭雲南內地江西等帮採辦甚擁、市價步步前進、越做越好、最後價天女做至四百零四元、雙馬四百零三元、收市後仍緊俏、上午成交統計二千零四十二包、同行成交减少、實需生意占多數、上日成交四百六十包、共計二千五百零二包、行情二十支雙馬比上日漲價五元、天女漲七元、雙地球漲四元半、特金城平、八仙漲五元、三鼎漲二元、十支粗紗允昂、廠方開出又見增進、申新廠開出十支童子軍九百五十包、價爲二百九十六元、榮豐廠開出金橋五十包、價爲三百九十七元半、新裕廠開出十支變地球五十包、價爲二百九十九元、永安廠開出二十支特金城二百包、價爲四百元打棧單均現出、昨天津來紗八十件、今日將有五十五件運津、茲將各帮成交額錄左、</p>
<p>同業　六三五　汕頭　六六五</p>
<p>福州　一七〇　香港　五○</p>
<p>寗波　二　雲南　一四○</p>
<p>厦門　二〇　內地　二二〇</p>

<p>統計风格、〇四二</p>
<p>上日成交補紀如左　　同行</p>
<p>一一〇　雲南　四六〇</p>
<p>統計　四六〇</p>
<p>兩日成交合計二、五〇二</p>
<p>日紗市塲、實際需要依然岑寂、但市價堅穩如故、因多頭意態堅定、且價格如跌、决不輕易晚卸、市面因之立定、二十支水月現貨價爲三百二十八元、二月停頓無交易、二十支藍鳳現紗價爲三百二十三元、三四月現貨價爲三百二十八元半、</p>
<p>目下二十支棉紗如雙馬現紗價已爲三百九十五元、頗有讀者欲一明成本之究竟、迭來要求、本報爲副讀者求知欲起見、姑舉二十支棉紗和花成分配合實例、以資硏究</p>
<p>以上係以製紗一包、用棉三百五十斤（司碼秤）計算、則一包紗所費之棉價為二百七十八元二角五分、再加製造費及營業費雜項開銷連統稅總計五十五元、成本凈數爲三百三十三元二角五分、如此可計算每包紗利益爲如何矣、</p>
<p>395－（278.25+55.00）＝61.75即一包紗獲利六十一元七角五分、</p>
<p>但此不過舉例、實際如何、尙觀各紗廠內部之情形而定、（A）</p>
<p>蠶絲事業</p>
<h3>最近的絲價（續四日）為什麼會過度飛漲（小禾）</h3>
<p>上述國外一方面之原因是偏重在一般性的、原則性上的理由、關于說明絲價過度的騰漲、所以要在最近間爆發起來、它還需要有一種時間上的遇合的理山來補充、還統是上月、紐的生絲之數字、——市塲上臨時原因所造成的一種反應—能够吿訴我們。</p>
<p>據Sillc　Associationof　America所報吿一月份紐的生絲市塲、確乎有一種可以激發絲價上升之原因在、就是一月份美國生絲寔銷增加五六一二担、進口减少六一七二担、這使一月底紐的存　額下减了四七二四担、不僅如此、在二月中、各地生絲輸美在送之總額、又較上月下减一二七〇〇担之巨、這下减之差額、幾達平時紐約生絲消費總額三分之一弱、這種情形、激發着絲價在上月中逐步上升、這種統計之數字、更促成了絲價在這一週來的突飛猛進、</p>
<p>第二方面，就是要說到本埠情形</p>
<p>在抗戰的國內產絲區域，產絲量的無法維持戰後產額，是意中事，所以戰後的上海絲市，每每脫離了世界絲市的趨向。同時，本埠的絲業經營者，因爲過份的忽視了國外情形，於是在這牛年來，國外正在急迫吸收和尋找二〇—二二條紋之白廠經時，是給國外搭了便宜去。這事情，在一位有經騐的絲業中人口中，承認了數月前自己的疏忽，同時由於這位先生的提醒，多數絲業者，也記起了下列這麼一回現象。即去年九月起，所有上海拍發紐的，倫敦，里勗的絲電，不論仟何時候，任何市價，國外的回音，往往是無條件的接受了二〇—二二條紋的廠絲，把絲價略爲捺低了些而接受了一六—一八條紋之廠絲，第三，就是完全把一三—一五條紋之廠絲原璧奉還，不予理會。在這種現象的疏忽之下，上海的絲廠商，是把所有的近期貨完全拗罄，在白廠絲價挺進到一一〇〇元的時候，十二月份的期貨，差不多早已空空如也了。於是接下去就是絲價的暴漲，一直一帆風順漲到了一三五〇元關。這時候，上海白廠絲的二三月期的解貨，也早已花有主了。</p>
<p>這一方面的第二點，我們就須來想想上海綢廠的需要了。本埠綢廠，向來是以洋行退貨之白廠絲，作爲主要的原料來源，因爲這種品質上比較决一點的生絲，在洋行中碰壁出來價格較廉，同時比之一般漫無標準之决等生絲，則可靠得多。一般綢廠均樂於購買，但在這上述幾點原因下，因爲國外要求的迫切絲價的步步上升，洋行中就絕少發現退貨，而絲價却極度刺激着用戶市塲，於是綢廠方面，便不得不以高價來爭取自己的原料來源了。這結果使絲市的重心反了常，用戶的絲價高出了洋行進價的百元左右。使綢廠對原料如許迫切的原故，當然還是因了季候的關係：冬李是春夏綢料的織製時期，是用眞絲最多的時期，這是我們不該忘記的。這不但在中國是這樣，在世界各處，也都是這樣的。</p>
<p>綜合上面兩部份原因，這近月餘來的絲價的高騰，實在是盲目的經營之結果，而像這樣地來騰漲絲價，也不僅不是絲業本身樂親的寄託所在，相反的，受到這秤騰漲的壓力的，還是自己人，結果連絲業的本身也受不到好處。</p>
<p>「本是同根生，相煎何太急」這句話，原誠懇地奉獻給絲蘭商，及絲廠商。</p>
<h3>本棉銷路亦微</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市因華盛頓方面封於政府之貨款棉出售問題、討論已有多日、而迄未解决、因之棉價頗受拘束、市上交易、大都係屬掉期及套買、各廠對現棉進胃、已不若前之盛、昨日漲二磅音、印度停市、預測不動、埃及漲一二磅音、昨日滙兌又趨疲軟、折合法幣、棉價俱漲計美棉及巴西棉每担漲二角、即度漲一角、埃及漲三角餘、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易殊爲靜寂、即各日廠商近亦無臃辦外棉之意、華廠方面、申新停購已將一週、年內亦已無採辦意、素以產棉著稱之天津區內各華廠因存棉缺乏、亦擬在滬採購外棉、現已分頭在滬接洽、華北日廠、需棉亦甚孔殷、日商已有多量外棉運津、咋日交易寂然、茲將外棉價格分列於後、</p>
<p>本棉生意、寥似晨星、廠胃不健、日廠意態疎懈、對於本棉絕端無染指之念、蓋以邇日抵滬之印　、異常擁擠、各棧皆有滿坑滿谷之勢、各廠原料需用、目前充足、掉綽有餘、所以紗布銷路雖復興，現棉仍屬黯無生色、祗新生新開車稍有消費、然爲額微乎其微也、蘇北來貨、通州花五日到一千四百九十四包、六日到八百三十四包、新港來棉花二百九十件、茲將現棉售開市盤及成交額量、分誌如左、</p>

<h3>絲價仍向　高峯進　輯里售開九百元絲繭均有運歐洲</h3>
<p>昨日絲市、紐的停市、橫濱現貨九一三元、收盤九三〇元、遠期九〇三元、下午收盤九一二元、但英法洋行對白廠經之進價、則爲一四六○兀、因廠商持價甚堅、故並無成交、印莊輯里絲黑星等級、已售開九百元、絲市仍向高峯邁進中、故交易並未旺盛、昨內外計成交三十担、</p>
<p>前日（五日）有湖絲三百五十二件、絲頭一百六十二件運歐洲、並有繭子五十五件運法國、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷糖在廈門　又有不能轉口說國糖開出殊寥寥</h3>
<p>昨荷糖復有厦門不能轉口之傳說、故趨勞仍緊、公會劃盤、二四荷粗白外棧貨二十四元、本棧貨二十四元一角半、大金錢嘜二十四元二爲半、轉口荷粗白、出戶呌十六元、進戶還十五元九角、擯持未成、荷赤現貨小五分、以十六元五角半、成交二百包、轉口貨仍十一元、太古車白B嘜、東棧交貨二十三元三角、西棧交貨二十三元四角半、成交五百餘包、CX嘜東棧二十三元一角半、CW嘜二十三元二角、DY嘜二十三元一角、HX嘜二十三元、本廠綿白無更動、振記一號二十五元餘照退、本廠一號氷三十二元二角、號盤有潮帮開出枝洋一批、較高者十六元半至十六元、决之十五元八角至十五元三角、陳汕赤十四元一角至十三元半共成交六百餘包、</p>
<p>咋有糖自北海來一百二十件、海口來一百三十件、汕頭來二百包、</p>
<p>糧食</p>
<h3>洋麥接續到滬　前後逹二萬五千噸本麥昻貴粉銷不暢</h3>
<p>粉昨现销比前略增、因値週初、買賣雙方興緻較濃、南洋帮二號粉零星交易絡繹、北洋帮則以當地洋粉充斥、申粉需要不暢、下脚粉反爲注意、統市成交二號四號粉各有二三萬包、車船牌二號粉悉照四元八角之原盤、四號紅財神粉售開四元二角、比前已見鬆動、市面已入高定次疲之局、今日出口、麵粉有五千五百包、運往天津、又二千包、運往烟台、又一萬三千包、運往威海衛、</p>
<p>麥市稍見上展、因來源前昨兩天到貨的僅四五千包、新到貨售主均以成本昂大、不願輕易脫手、而廠方則以前定洋麥、續到一船、對於國麥需要、亦屬怠懈、故交易雛暢、統市僅開江北及蕪湖麥兩種共計三千包、江北麥六元六角、蕪湖麥價六元二角至五元九角、由福新廠辦去二千包、阜豐廠辦去一千包、市因存到兩少、提漲數分、</p>
<p>近日美麥陸續運來、除賑濟者外、即廠家自辦者亦甚多、怡泰公司Rile.v輪裝來八千三百八十三噸、原定昨日抵滬、現聞改於今晨進口、停泊十四。十五號浮筒過駁、該公司之Jantze　Fritzen號、裝有八千八百九十三噸的十九日可到、並有天祥洋行之Harmatris輪、裝來七千七百五十噸、已於前日（五日）抵滬、停泊十七·十八號浮筒、上述各輪所裝美麥、開均係達孚洋行、代廠家所訂購、</p>
<h3>客秈新有囤積　杜粳銷場轉淡</h3>
<p>秈米零囤两活、行情續見上砌、高貨以南京一帶來源不繼、蕪湖特高秈昨日提至十元零八角半、大市貨以下一律跟起、比上週末已步漲二角許、昨交易有囤戶問津、頗形熱鬧、全日成交數加至二干五百包之譜、</p>
<p>國米來源共到河下二號、車輪包子則有六七千包、到貨一多、人心即軟、兼之一度暢銷後、本街及囤戶胃口飽滿、致昨銷路轉淸、惟市面因貨主心思尙堅、價呈定局、結果　薄粳行情悉守原盤、杜洋尖及埠尖站定、變元去路亦淡、致價乏上落、</p>
<h3>疋頭　甬棉織業雖有呼籲　東疋交易不减毫末</h3>
<p>國布川·滇·汕及本街漂梁坯布去化仍佳、本市囤户亦頗努力吸納、現期貨俱有躉額成交、紗素府綢本街大小襯杉帮均已發動、逐日成交的二三千疋、川帮亦有躉批裝出、本年開價每碼三角六七分、而去秋售盤祗二角二三分、四十二支紗綫素府綢現市每碼四角六七分、按去秋市盤爲三角四五分、漲起均達十分之三、聞主要原因、乃以東洋細紗錢坯布、戰後缺乏進口、本埠日廠紐紗綫原料猛漲之故、聞在戰前此項細紗綫坯布運來一年達二萬件以上、川滇帮現銷仍旺、現期貨續購三百餘件、汕頭帮辦細斜細布府綢色布綸昌等廠藍布花布一百餘箱、浙贛沿綫廣豐等內地向本市批發號添購雜類棉布二千餘疋、本市國户購申新永安廠出品細布細斜怡和粗布一百數十件、</p>
<p>東布昨白貨細布市盤微昂、每疋喊高二分半、天津帮進十二磅龍頭彩球飛魚喇叭各牌細布的三百包、本街批發號添辦細布亦有三百餘件、而行開二三四月份期貨細布綜計拋出達一千五六百件、伊藤洋行開額敢多、的九百件、東棉的四百件、日信江商各開二三百包、價列如下、能頭細布每疋十二元、飛魚細布十二元一角、喇叭細布十一元七角、藍雙魚細布十一元六角、龍頭細斜期貨索價須十一元七角半、故無售開、</p>
<p>寗波織造業公會前以「該會會員棉織針織工廠受政令之限制、及上海各工廠變相日貨之傾銷—上海棉織針織染織各業採用日紗日布者當在百分之九十以上、其出品美其名爲國產、實爲日貨之改製品、若任其暢銷內地、財源外流、不但內地工廠倒閉無遺、抑且戰時經濟無法維持、」請政府禁止其運銷內地、但因空言不能見諸事實、故上海發「國難財一之棉織各業、毫不感動興趣、依然我行我素、</p>
<p>今日疋頭出口運天津七十件、又運烟台二百十件</p>
<h3>海味　黑白椒存底不充</h3>
<p>胡椒邇來到源極稀、銷路頗形活躍、致存底枯竭、刻市一號椒須售六十一二元、黑大椒五十八九元、汶島白椒九十五元、比前升起三五元不等、今日山東輪入口、運到海參三十件、</p>
<h3>南北貨　靑餅續鬆</h3>
<p>靑餅近市號幣續見鬆落、普通包莊又小數角、開十二元三角、箱莊排餅亦降四五角、較上者開十三元、决之十二元五角、聞內地去胃稍懈云、</p>
<h3>油餅　內地添辦年貨　豆油驟升三角</h3>
<p>昨日豆油交易、忽呈熱鬧、行情驟升二三角、蓋因內地添辦年貨、而市塲則以結束期中、售手稀少、以致市氣昂騰、統市共成交大連現豆油四五百桶、晨初即爲二十八元二角開盤、入後每盤步砌、結果二十八元三角五分收盤、花生油前自一批雨淋簍油甩跌以來、人心一度遭受打擊、近日潛勢轉定、行情亦守原盤、昨計做開膠州油五十件、價仍爲二十一元、</p>
<h3>五金　黃鋼絲交易繁　黑鐵壞子津銷盛</h3>
<p>黃鋼絲　近因環境良好、步趨漲風、但彈簧廠。熱水瓶廠·鐵床廠等、需辦孔亟、致市上之佾檔花色被搜一空、而烟津諸帮因作魚鈞之用、亦在辦不已、故運日市交頻繁、綜計開出達六七百担之多、因此市上流通貨異常薄弱、行淸紛紛提漲、如組花每市担沽十七元、中檔花色售十八元五角、細花色則開二十元左右、至於一種混亂貨、則每担開十五元光景、惟連日實交暢達、人心奇好、</p>
<p>黑鐵坯子　連日天津帮在辦、如、永記萬　泰等辦去達三百餘噸、（約計六千餘担）、致市上現貨被拽殆盡、但行情一節、因歲暮關係、執貨者急圖脫手、故有每况愈下之嘆、最初開二十九元、（每二百磅算）、陸續回至二十八元四角半、開遠期拋貨售出爲三十八元三角、但本街零戶開價每箱仍爲二十九元至二十九二角半云、</p>
<h3>紙張　錫箔加價應年銷</h3>
<p>錫箔近以年節需要、消化日旺、來源以產地人工缺乏、製造量不能如預期之多、故原料之錫價雖已回鬆、而工費開支反見加增、各店門市塊銷均以雜費昂大難以沾利、故批發每條售價仍持原盤外、其門市零售每塊價則續加二分云、</p>
<h3>煤炭　堅炭到存俱缺</h3>
<p>溫州大簍堅炭、邇來到存俱缺、號盤堅定逾恒、查目前號方由甌江運到一批統共僅一千餘担、聞開價四十磅大簍每担五元二角、三十磅四兀四角、平簍七靑三兀八角、小簍禾炭一元八角、同行洋涇浜碼頭排車、送到每担另加車力五分、</p>
<h3>進出口　大宗貨物運歐　藥材亦有進口</h3>
<p>前日（五日）有大宗貨物運往歐洲、計紗頭一百七十件、皮十件、葉二百零九箱、腸二十件、頭髮十五件、蛋黃二十五件、大黃八件、烟葉八百四十四件、又有紙一萬四千三百件運往靑島、</p>
<p>昨日進口計自寗波來烟葉八百三十件、紙九百八十件、天津來毛冷八件、汕頭來　貨二千六百件、</p>
<p>又本期廣東輪到埠、由海防運來藥材三十二件、香港來砂仁五件、果皮七十七件、</p>

<h3>九曲嶺上</h3>
<p>— 紹光</p>
<p>臘月裏，天空飄著雪，</p>
<p>九曲嶺上的梅花，</p>
<p>朶朶的開放了，</p>
<p>冷寂的花影間，</p>
<p>隱藏著小鋼砲的口徑。</p>
<p>山腰裏挖築好堅固的壕溝，</p>
<p>閃動著守衛的人影。</p>
<p>「來送死吧，山腳下的敵人！」</p>
<p>一個忠勇的機關槍手，</p>
<p>興奮而又鎭靜的說著，</p>
<p>滿臉露出必勝的笑容。</p>
<p>拍，拍，拍，……</p>
<p>打擊敵人的槍聲響了，</p>
<p>緊張的一剎那，</p>
<p>雪地上斜躺著幾十個屍身，</p>
<p>殷紅的血，刻畫著</p>
<p>侵略者的罪行和殘忍！</p>
<p>可憐的死鬼呀，</p>
<p>誰呌你們遠離家國，拋棄妻兒，</p>
<p>來到這兒幹自殺殺人的勾當？</p>
<p>你們究竟爲的什麽呢？</p>
<p>青天白日的旗子，</p>
<p>在高嶺上微笑，</p>
<p>抗戰勝利的呼聲，</p>
<p>在雪花裏奔騰。</p>
<p>朶朶的梅花，</p>
<p>送出縷縷的馨香，</p>
<p>好像慰勉戰士的忠勇。</p>
<p>茫茫的原野看不見敵人的影蹤，</p>
<p>他們敗退了，—</p>
<p>逃進十里外的一座死城。</p>
<p>呵，這次英勇的戰鬥，</p>
<p>又給敵人一個嚴重的敎訓！</p>
<h3>滿園春色關不住</h3>
<p>— 金振雄作</p>
<h3>寫</h3>
<p>— 熾强</p>
<p>寫，寫，寫，……。</p>
<p>不斷地儘管寫，究竟寫點什麽東西出來呢？</p>
<p>是的，壯烈性的英雄氣魄，最要緊；相機勾他一兩筆，不久會產生一個雄赳赳的典型人物來；多動。</p>
<p>但，吃不消，梁山泊上那氣的造像？苗頭不對，弄斧不可靠近班門，大家心裏明白。而且一個聰明人常常非笑傻子，爲的是劈頭亂撞，幹著一件吃力不討好的事情。</p>
<p>『兒女情長』，寫點嗚咽味，好麽？</p>
<p>不行！這是一個什麽年代呵！朋友，誰還答應你這麽『抽抽噎噎』，『彈琴復長嘯』呢？</p>
<p>無已，寫不出，完啦！什麽也寫不出。閉門推出油膩腥氣，斬斷『得兒飄是飄』—飄忽的游絲。</p>
<p>然而，『有爲者亦若是』，一不做，二不休，文飯小件，雜品傢財，抖擻著精神，來！來！來！思想上或意境上慣常翔而不集的小鳥，不可隨便讓牠飛開。重開既閉的茅塞罷，不妨雕琢句把。抗戰勝利，與有榮焉！</p>
<p>光幌一點的，咳！踏破枯腸，無『句』可『覓』，大概『妙手』，不『覓』也溜出來，而且『骨拉鬆脆』：</p>
<p>『月照千潭，大映西湖冷翡翠之夜，……』</p>
<p>別有心腸的，又來了。你看，醒醒罷，時代轉向那邊了。還不該掉過頭來趕上去？</p>
<p>標準化的，哪，在這裏：</p>
<p>筆下留神，當心！寫你曉得的東西，舊夢少重溫，還應該隨時考究客觀環境上的接受和唾棄，能夠『神』而『化』之，這才上乘。眞的有點要嗚呼了。</p>
<p>立刻，有許多裝成曉得或熟悉現實的模樣者輩出，寫罷！橫豎寫出來給那引起不曉得的人去讀，也許大家在這個不曉得的當口，神面明之，自然而然會得拚湊成功一種『想當然耳』的輿論，這輿論不久就會『翕然』起來，因此，『抗戰八股』（作興少幾股也說不定，手頭沒有欽定本，無從考核）立刻成功文壇上第一把『敝帚』。</p>
<p>提起『敝帚』，老實不客氣都會得『自珍』起來，雖然摧枯拉朽，不　力量；就是廓清門庭，也還吃力。然而要是說它不配稱掃帚，踢開去，一定是眼巴巴的盯著，而且這其間作與就是仇視。最搪不牢的便是有『分化抗戰力量』的嫌疑。因此，文壇上擠得水泄不通的，都是這一流派。一年多了，我們看到深入人心，藝術的精品，究竟有多少？</p>
<p>『毋爲仇者快』，遮蓋些，將就點。據說『槍口朝外』之後，隱惡揚善之風，立刻無孔不入，變成麻痺，能夠不做漢奸，夠心滿意足了。一百二十個同胞，誤盡蒼生，『愛』之，能勿『勞』乎？有筆階級，在『勞』字上究竟做出多少成績來？</p>
<p>我將謝罪於彥達之前：恕我又來撥舌頭，弄是非了。同胞呀！都是同胞，一條戰綫的啦。</p>
<p>然而我看到的，就是同胞，又是同胞。</p>
<p>避塵囂，祛熱血，開冷門，燒冷　，三五朋輩，儼然『吾道不孤』，發揚光大『豐腴之臀』，搜羅海內色情照片，寫來優哉游哉的文章。</p>
<p>一個熱血青年，也是同胞，說他毋離開現實的時代太遠，並且曉以大義，那個微妙的辯解聽說是這樣的：</p>
<p>『只消不曾把豐腴之臀，寫成乾癟的肚皮，也就　現實了！』這才使我明白了當前的一切，並且所謂『統一』也者，『聯合陣綫』云云，原來都要飯吃飽來　說的。於是拿起筆來。</p>
<h3>獨裁者的側面（上）</h3>
<p>— 哲非譯</p>
<p>史太林</p>
<p>晚上在家裏，在蘇維埃城中心一所私人公寓的客室裏，一盞有罩的電燈放射出和樂溫暖的光芒。燈光落在一架鋼琴上，落在一個彈鋼琴的身材苗條，頭髪烏黑的小女郎身上。在一隻角隅裏，一位身材魁梧的偉人，灰白色頭髪朝後梳著，嘴邊一簇沉垂的鬍鬚，前額滿是心事的線紋，他靜靜坐著傾聽，他的深思的眼光望著前面。</p>
<p>這女郎呌斯維拉娜，年紀只有十二歲，是那位一萬六千五百萬俄人獨裁者的女兒，那聽琴的就是她的父親。</p>
<p>只有在他女兒在黃昏彈著鋼琴的時候，史太林才暫時忘掉一下他的責任，他周圍的種種陰謀，他的疾病和對暗殺的戒心。</p>
<p>斯維拉娜是史太林繼室娜第希達·亞勒羅依伐的女兒，這位繼室已於六年前死了。史太林在他的女兒身上看到了他之妻的小影，爲了她的母親他以一種人性的熱忱愛撫著他的女兒，這和他的獨裁者的冷酷，是一個驚人的對照。</p>
<p>他也特別寵愛她，斯維拉伐是他的三個孩子中最活潑可人的一個，其中一個是他前妻的兒子，現在已經二十一歲，另一個是十七歲的伐斯耶，是婦第希達所生的兒子。有位忠心的保姆常和她在一起，二三個特別偵探在暗中保衛著她。</p>
<p>她像別的俄國兒童一樣，在一所國立學校中讀書，但在家裏有一個專敎英文的敎師。她喜歡聽神仙故事，愛玩綱球和滑冰，但她最大的愛是對她的父親，她的願望對於他，就好像是命令。</p>
<p>她受蘇維埃共和國觀念的敎養，將來她也得盡蘇維埃公僕的任務。不過史太林最近甚至妒忌她的功課時間。他曉得他也許晚年無多，所以更渴想他這小女兒能在身邊，因爲只有她才能使他泰然自若，心裏感到平和。</p>
<h3>生日</h3>
<p>— 萍痕</p>
<p>傍晚。</p>
<p>東方圓圓的月兒，靜悄悄地爬上樹梢，淡淡地，苦笑著臉。誰呢？會有失意的事。</p>
<p>……賢弟提起望家鄉，不由子卿兩淚汪，一同且把望鄉臺上，不知家鄉在何方……</p>
<p>一陣京胡嘹亮的聲音接著傳了過來，這又何嘗會有失意的事，歌聲，琴聲，眞是傍晚最雅緻動人的樂調。</p>
<p>面前走過來一個老人，彷彿是我的祖父，白的頭髪，折的鬍鬚，癟著嘴唇，輕輕地問：『剛才這段搖板唱的如何？』</p>
<p>『不錯。』</p>
<p>『孩子！你忘記了吧？在你週歲，十歲，廿歲，以致於現在，都有人唱著好聽的戲給你聽，你也不會忘記的，現在他們又唱著戲慶賀你的生日。』</p>
<p>『怎麼？慶賀我的生日？』</p>
<p>那裏有我的祖父，淡淡地地上印著我的影子，我望著影子發癡，怎麼，我的生日就在今朝。</p>
<p>我低下頭來想一：</p>
<p>慈母撫慰著我的頭髪，也輕輕地說：『孩子！今天是你的生日，你一人漂泊在外，還不回到家裏來嗎？』</p>
<p>『怎麼？我還有家？』</p>
<p>『癡孩子！你看。』</p>
<p>那裏有我的慈母，還不是我一個人，這個又太奇了，我的生日爲什麽要在今天。我抬頭再看看月亮；圓圓的，又爬高了不少，大概今天是我的生日，記得我的生日總在月亮圓的時候。</p>
<p>『媽！我今天又過生日了。』一個小孩子向他的母親說。</p>
<p>『發霉，過生日，你的命不知是那一個的哩？』狠狠的聲音。</p>
<p>孩子的哭聲，衝破了惡的氣氛，清醒的我，癡呆地站在月光底下，什麽也忘記了，忘記了剛才想的事情。</p>
<p>隻身子影，天涯何入沒有一個棲所，生日，忘記它，祗要有我的生命，就有我的生日。</p>
<p>家鄉，到處就是我的家鄉，我的生日都忘記它，家鄉也跟著生日一樣地忘記，等我到了家鄉再想我的生日。</p>
<p>天空飛的一剎，銀光刺眼，還有流星。是一個憨笨的人，頭腦受了刺激，或思或想，或觸景思物，在一綫銀光下徬徨。迅速的追上銀光吧！謀一綫生機。</p>
<p>月亮又在微笑了。</p>
<p>晚。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>二　逃難與赴難</p>
<p>葉老先生的家，是在市梢頭靠近田野的地方，離開鄉公所還有好一段路。葉團長攙著他父親走回家去，那一張古銅色的國字臉，好像蒙著一層陰雲一般，顯得非常沉鬱。</p>
<p>他們一路行走著，來時很熱鬧的路上，經過這一番轟炸，突然變得非常冷落了，店家都上起了排門，不再做生意，有幾家門裏有人在喊喊喳喳的談論，隱約好像說炸彈落在萬春醬園裏，炸死了七個人，醬缸都被炸得粉碎，還震坍了前後左右八間房屋，壓傷了不少人。葉老先生震了一震，但並不說什麽話。葉團長不住咬著嘴唇皮，眼裏射著堅決而憤怒的光。就這樣他們一直來到了家。</p>
<p>葉老先生住的是一幢三開門前後兩進三樓三底的房屋，他們到家時門並沒有關，推門進去，裏面竟闊無一人，家裏人都不知到那里去了，直到葉團長在天井裏呌了一聲，纔看見他弟弟方英，從後門口扶梯腳下跑出來說：</p>
<p>『大哥，我們都在這里。』</p>
<p>葉團長推開了後面的屏門，向裏看了一看，不禁失笑了起來。他看見扶梯腳下鋪著稻草，母親葉太太，妹妹方慧，最小的弟弟方文，和家裏用的傭人僕婦，都擁做一團，坐在地下，葉太太頸上還蒙碰上一件濕布衫。這滑稽的模樣，使他好久不能忍住笑聲，只是用手指點著他們說：</p>
<p>『快出來！你們簡直連一些防空常識都沒有！這樣一個脆弱的扶梯，怎樣能避炸彈？像這樣緊擠在一塊，要是上面眞的落下一顆炸彈來，那豈不是大家都完結了。』</p>
<p>葉太太撩開了蒙在頭上的濕布衫，從地下站起來，臉上慘白沒有血色，她一面走出屏門，一面把手連連拍著胸口說：</p>
<p>『哎唷唷！嚇煞快！××飛機已經去了沒有？剛才那轟隆一響，眞嚇死人了！』</p>
<p>『已經去得遠了，媽放心，不要緊的。』葉團長安慰他母親說。</p>
<p>『方俊，』葉老先生聲音很沉著的在東廂房裏喊，一壁抱著白銅水煙袋在房裏踱來踱去，直到葉團長走進房來，他纔坐下了，又把手裏的紙煤指了指對面的椅子說：『你坐下，我有話和你談。』</p>
<p>這時，葉太太也帶著子女們進房來了，在家的眼光都集中在葉團長臉上，好像各人的命運都在等他作最後判決似的。葉老先生抽了一筒煙，把煙灰吹落在地上，才開始對葉團長說：（六）</p>

<h3>醫師之職業道德</h3>
<p>— 馮志寅</p>
<p>昔賢有言「不爲良相當爲良醫一。夫醫之與相，分位懸殊，相提並論，似乎不倫；然推其用心，固皆以利濟爲的，仁心仁術是也，廣義言之，道德是也。言有高尙之道德，始可居阿衡之位，稱良相而無慚；亦惟有高尙之道德，始可操醫藥之權，稱良醫而無愧。醫人醫國，初無二致，醫之爲昔賢所推崇着在是，爲社會所景仰者亦在是；吾則問其頭銜非不高貴也：其學問非不深遠也；攷其技術非不熟練也；觀其器械非不精良也；然心術不純，不以服務爲的，而以牟利爲亟，已難造福人羣，有愧良醫之目。况學無　長，以術行詐，其貽害於社會更屢何堪設想，無怪世人對於醫師，多良莠不齊之感，漸生輕蔑鄙視之心，與昔賢之以良相並稱者，觀念逈殊，此無他：乏職業道德故耳。所謂「人必自侮而後人侮之」也。以言職業，則萬有不同，雖各有其應守之道德，而醫界實居首要；蓋人或不幸而罹疾病，當呻吟轉側之時，欲求醫師之治療，無異嬰兒之投慈母，衷心之期望何等急切；苟爲醫師者徒以對方階級之或殊，酬報之稍異而於治療上，上下其手，掉以輕心，已負此神聖之使命。况專以牟利爲的，置人命於度外者乎？若而人者實自忘其職業之高尙，而甘儕於巫覡　祝，江湖下賤之流矣，可勝慨嘆！夫爲醫師者學問技術，固不可不精；器械用具，固不可不備，特是道德觀念，允不可不重，良以醫之爲業，屬於慈善性質之職業也，本以利人爲最高目的。倘乏慈祥惻怛之懷，痌　在抱之念，則目標旣誤，其變遷所屆，有不可究詰者矣。在本人何貴有此職業？在社會何貴有此醫師？不佞自開業問世以來，瞬已十餘載矣，深愧業未加精，名未稍顯；惟對於職業之道德，自問差能恪守，未敢須臾或志，卑之無甚高論，道德云者：並無深奧之理解，即人人同具之天良，能問心無愧而已，書此以自勉，並以質諸吾醫界先進。</p>
<p>疾病常職</p>
<h3>胃病（二）</h3>
<p>— 莊畏仲</p>
<p>上述普通型慢性胃炎之外，另有因梅毒或結核而起的慢性胃炎，以後當再詳述。</p>
<p>胃炎爲器質的疾病，自有相當的病理變化，這不在常識範圍之內，所以只有把大略情形，概括地一說。大概急性胃炎，黏膜必有相當變化，甚至侵及深層（胃組織分三層，一爲黏膜，二爲肌層，三爲漿膜），其變化爲糜爛，進而成爲潰瘍，甚至漿膜穿孔。腺分泌方面，當然也受影響。慢性胃炎。則其病理上分爲二型，一爲萎縮型，一爲肥大型。凡此病理變化，均與臨證上有重大關係。</p>
<p>丟開病理變化不談，而論胃炎的症狀。胃炎旣有急性和慢性的分別，所示症狀，無論爲主觀的（自覺）爲客觀的（他覺）方面，總有不同，但二者頗有類似的地方，不過輕重不同罷了。</p>
<p>現在先說急性胃炎的症狀，的要講來，有胃部劇痛，嘔吐，腹瀉或便秘，發熱，舌被厚苔等數種。胃痛幾爲急性胃炎必有的症狀，但痛的性質，並不如潰瘍之有一定。嘔吐非爲必現的症狀，然多數急性胃炎病人，在天然的防病機構上，要把有害的胃內容物排除，或由胃內容物刺激反射之結果，常見此症，如頻回嘔吐時，病人殊覺不耐，其初雖爲胃內容物，後則爲黏液，如有糜爛潰瘍，或不免吐血，但此爲極少見之例。普通胃內容嘔出後，病人自覺爽快，治療得當，可不至再吐。若干病入，則但有噯氣惡心而不至嘔吐。又普通胃炎多合併腸炎，合併腸炎者，多見泄瀉，但亦未必盡然。若干急性胃炎病人，則常見便秘。急性胃炎，通例發熱不至過高，或完全無熱，惟小兒的患本病者，多數有攝氏表三十九度左右之熱。至於舌被厚苔，則凡急性胃炎病人皆難逃此例，病人食慾，已經减少，加以舌部被苔，味覺受阻，更厭飲食。急性胃炎之由於腐蝕藥而來者（卽中毒性胃炎），則疼痛較劇，且吐物中每含有血液，甚至嘔血。</p>
<p>决述慢性胃炎的症狀，病人食慾减退，消化不良，胃部時感脹悶，口渴口臭，惡心，噯氣，有時嘔吐，舌亦有苔，同時病人時苦便秘。以上各種症狀，爲慢性胃疾病所共有，初非一般所謂普通型慢性胃炎的獨特症狀。在一般醫界習慣上遇病入有上述各症，姑名以慢性胃炎，但餒格言之，上述各症，僅爲一症候羣，除下以「慢性胃炎」一假定病名之外；仍宜注意體察，以求其癓結所在。純粹無別種疾病而單爲普通型慢性胃炎者，實際上並不多見。依科學的說法，卽胃並無炎症的變化，也許有此症狀。故欲確下「慢性胃炎」之診斷，必須於炎症變化上有相當之證明方可，尤宜參考旣往症狀，檢查胃液，診察全體之後，始可决定。更宜注意本病每爲他病的一分症，需仔細查察其有無他病。疾病常識</p>
<h3>正在流行之天花（續）</h3>
<p>— 聶傳賢</p>
<p>天花之病原與症狀大概：天化之病原，乃一種濾過性病毒，亦云由某種菌所致，但至今未有人能確定其說，天花病程進行概况，普通的分四期，第一爲潛伏期，乃病毒自侵入至病發時期爲止，的爲十二日至十四日，在此時期，息者並無異感，第二乃發病期，此時忽然感覺惡寒，戰慄，體溫驟升至三十九度至四十度，同時發生劇烈頭痛，背痛，嘔吐，食慾不振，面現潮紅等，三四日後，進入第三期，是爲發疹期，乃先現鮮紅凸起之丘疹，自面部擴及全身，續成水皰，最後成膿皰，而至結痂，第四期爲脫痂期，常遺永久之瘢痕，即俗呼爲「麻子」。</p>
<p>天花之危險：天花一症，至今醫學上尙未有特效療法，死亡率亦復不低，允其在兒童未曾種痘而感染天花者，極多死亡，天花之變型病例甚多，如出血性型，疹皰融合型等，皆十九死亡，在病程中合併症狀亦多，有因眼結膜炎，角膜潰瘍等，而致終身殘疾，有因肺枝氣管炎肺炎等，柱往成爲致命之因，據知某隔離醫院中今年已有很多險惡病例，允以出血性型，已連見不少，同時成人息者，亦復不少，並非若吾人平日所想像，天花傳染祇多屬於小兒，是應特則別注意者也。（未完）</p>

<h3>傳梁病家消毒之簡法（下）</h3>
<p>— 朱仰高</p>
<p>（二）結束消毒</p>
<p>結束消毒，是施行於病者已愈，或死亡之後，所有病者所住之病房，及其所含之一切器具或物件，作一决大大的消毒，而期望所有的病菌，悉數消滅，以免貽害他人。</p>
<p>病室及其臨近而疑有被傳染之可能性之房間，均須用百分之三之石炭酸液抹擦之。凡室中地板，桌子，椅，床，凳，以及一切傢具，均須行極週密之揩抹·所有縫隙之處，亦須設法將消毒劑注入·窒中墻壁，如系粉壁，則須重新粉刷一决，如素板壁，則亦用石炭酸稀液抹揩之，用消毒劑洗濯手續完畢後，然後冉用熱水及肥皂與刷子洗濯一决。衣服床帳以及其他布件，可聚而煮沸之，床墊則用消毒劑，如石炭酸稀液，或百分之一之福美林稀液，噴濕後，入日光曬乾之。書報紙類玩具等件，可直接焚燒。病室之可緊閉者，可於上項手續做畢後，則用下法消毒一决，以期消毒之周到，其法亦甚易而不費。惟在施行之前，須先將室中一切漏氣之縫隙，用紙及漿糊貼密，然後用下列之氣體滅菌劑消毒之·惟所用藥品之多少，須視房間地位之大小而定，故先須將房間容積量算出，即高度乘闊度，再乘長度是也，例如一室高爲四公尺，闊三公尺，一及長六公尺，則其乘出之容積量計七十一一立方公尺。茲將一每一立方公尺所需之藥品簡述於左：</p>
<p>Paraform　10.0格蘭姆</p>
<p>Natrium　bicardonicum　5.0格蘭姆</p>
<p>水量　50.0西西</p>
<p>以上三物和合一起，入一大型搪磁鍋內，再將Kalium　Permanganicum　25.0格蘭姆，漸漸加入於上液之中。惟加入時須小量，漸漸倒入（切不可悉數一氣倒進），不然，則易發生過熱，噴發而可傷及四週人物·再用木棒勻和，置於窒中，室中人畜則即離開，緊閉門户，聽其發汽，消毒七小時後，方可開門·惟因剩餘之汽體，尙有刺激作用，故即須開窗開門，流動空氣而散去之。</p>

<h3>諱言與諱疾</h3>
<p>— 桑子</p>
<p>中國人有種通病，便是「諱言與諱疾」，因此，一切工作，一切疾病，都在這「諱言與諱疾」的心理和精神下葬送了，犧牲了。我們認爲：工作要有改善或進展，疾病要有轉機或根除，必需要將一切工作的現象加以一番檢討和批判，從這種檢討和批判中，我們可以發現工作現象中的缺點；一切疾病的癥結，加以一番審察和診斷。從這審察和診斷中，我們可以發現疾病的眞象；而後纔得計畫開展或對症下藥。但這重要的關鍵，卻在工作者或病家的忠實的，坦白供述。然而一般病家，因爲心存羞惡，從來不肯吐露私隱，於是工作永遠不得進展，疾病永遠不得祛除，而形成了今日的政治病態和生理缺憾。</p>
<p>最近，中央執行委員會認爲現在國事艱危，百端待治，正嘗膽臥薪之日，非晏安豫逸之時，工作人員，宜如何憂勤惕勵，克盡厥職，以報黨國。乃近來仍有酒食微逐，恣意娛樂等情事，長此不振，將何以建事業而資表率。爲整飭紀綱，挽回風氣，以振起抗戰建國之精神起見，特通令所屬，凡工作人員，應絕對禁止賭博，跳舞，冶遊，及其他不正當之娛樂，這便是不諱言的措置，和抗戰時期中必要的設施，是值得我們稱頌的。</p>
<p>關於賭博，跳舞，冶遊及其他不正當的娛樂，各處都有，而以滬港兩地爲烈；一般工作人員犯此錯誤的爲數固屬不少，而一般民衆浸淫其中的，其數尤多。賭窟中呼慮喝雉，妓院中燈紅酒綠，舞榭中摟抱翩翩，所在都是，不僅浪費精神，抑且空耗外滙，這在抗戰中的中國，是個危險的現象，也是種嚴重的損失。我們希望，一般工作人員奉到這項命令後，知所警惕，一般同胞看到這項新聞，也該憬然覺悟。同時，將這種不諱言的精神，能夠再擴而充之，運用到一般工作方面去！</p>
<h3>「花濺淚」女性談</h3>
<p>— 于伶</p>
<p>—答某小姐問—</p>
<p>（一）一個笑話</p>
<p>—先生我告訴你一個笑話，一個關於你的笑話。—某小姐坐定之後，懷疑地端詳著我，矜持而又帶點羞澀地嬌笑。</p>
<p>—一個笑話？關於我的？</p>
<p>—是的，過去有一位尤競常有劇本在「婦女生活」上發戈，到「夜光杯」發戈之後，有許多小型報就把尤競列在女作家之羣中去了，現在你寫了「女子公寓」，又寫了「花濺淚」，那不是也……</p>
<p>—哈哈，笑話。其實我是非常之不了解女人的。這，ＳＹ知道得很清楚……。</p>
<p>她只是笑，可呌我有點窘了！</p>
<p>（二）請勿拷問我的模特兒</p>
<p>—先生，我知道你是不會跳舞的，可是……</p>
<p>—可是我認識幾位可敬的舞女。她們的理解與身世……</p>
<p>—聽說你「花濺淚」里的幾位舞女，是眞有模特兒的……我想……</p>
<p>—呵，不，某小姐，請你千萬別拷問我的模特兒，因爲我只是認識她們，說不上了解他們，更說不上……</p>
<p>聽說「女子公寓」里的人物，就有模特兒，眞有這樣的人，而且……</p>
<p>—呵，不，某小姐……「女子公寓」更是無中生有的創作，先說背景，上海就根本沒有這樣的「女子公寓」，致於人物更是……</p>
<p>—不是有幾位女主角很像我們熟識的友人麽？</p>
<p>—呵，那末只能說是巧合了，我倒眞的不曾居心寫誰。魯迅先生說得好，他的阿Q，就不是寫一兩個人……</p>
<p>—是的，我也讀過魯迅先生關於阿Q模特兒的話了。</p>
<p>（三）我同情她們</p>
<p>—先生：你同情你「花濺淚」中間的舞女麽？</p>
<p>—同情：不同情她們我怎麼會寫她們呢？</p>
<p>—你最同情誰？舞女中間……</p>
<p>—我同情米米，更同情顧小妹，連曼麗我也同情！</p>
<h3>一個希望的實現</h3>
<p>— 吳永剛</p>
<p>在沒有接受上海劇藝社要我導演「花濺淚」的職務以有，我是希望留在孤島上的電影從業員們和戲劇界的朋友們應更親密地攜手起來，合作而團結我們的精神，交流而堅强我們的力量。當我從復回到攝影塲中，我私人所得的結論便是，我們過去培養的力量，在這大時代轉變著的暴風雨中，顯得太薄弱了，雖然這力時是因戰鬥的需要而不斷地生長著。</p>
<p>幾個月的緊張生活，必然的使我得到了一個可貴的敎訓，同時也使我看清楚了暴露出來的我們自己的弱點。這是不能否認的事實，中國電影界是一個多災多難，百發育不健全的嬰孩，因了歷史的淺短，營養的不良，如今要負起澀重大的責任來，自然是相當困難的事，許多弱點便因此而暴露，這是在我們意料之中；但是弱點的暴露也正是腐敗的淘汰，接著，我們目前所最急要的是如何補充這殘缺不全的疲健的隊伍的問題便產生了。</p>
<p>這個問題，不僅僅發生在電影界，任何部門都是如此，和電影最接近的戲劇也如此。雖然戲劇是以陌生的眼視我，然而我卻是非常關切地，時時找機會，欲傾我潛伏著的滿腔熱情呈獻給戲劇，因爲我明白戲劇和電影是分不開的弟兄，由於彼此的互助和合作，燦爛的花朶將會開放得更多些，更而就話劇演員在銀幕上的成就的事實，我覺得我們更需要親密地攜手起來，不但使我們彼此藉以相互地督促和規勉，我們必然的因了力量的集中而能迅速地建立起新的隊伍。</p>
<p>所以，我便大膽地，毫不加以思慮地擔任了「花濺淚」的導演職，作爲我第一次導演舞臺劇的嘗試，我是希求從學習中取得研究的方法，並且我還預備再次三次的積許多次的學習而希望獲得一些經騐。同時這也是我的一個希望的實現，我是很欣喜地。不過我也是很憂慮地，我老是懷疑著我的工作的不能勝任。我知道爲了大家更重要的事情，大家都會予我批評和指示。</p>
<h3>給一位舞國裏的友人</h3>
<p>— 藍蘭</p>
<p>××：</p>
<p>我們雖祗在一個偶然的機緣裏會見了一次，但是你的曼妙的倩影伴著你的良善的靈魂卻永遠在縈繞著我的心底。</p>
<p>××，請你原諒我，在往昔，我因未嘗依據一般淺見者的眼光來估量你和其他的姊妹們，特別因爲我自己也是個女人，我能夠很清楚地瞭解生存在這個男姓中心社會裏的女人們的一切痛苦和不幸，但是說老實話，在沒有遇見你之先，我卻未曾料想到，在這樣黑暗污穢的環境裏，居然也會產生聖潔如你的白蓮，成長在渾濁的泥中。</p>
<p>你可記得，當你坦白地向我娓娓訴說你的可歌可泣的遭遇時，我也在陪著你偷偷的擦眼淚？××，我要告訴你，當我在扮演著「花濺淚」中的米米，聽信著卑鄙的男子花言巧語而服毒自殺的時候，我再也抑制不住自己，失聲的哭了！</p>
<p>那個我所扮演著的米米，無論在個性，舉動，思想等方面不十分和你相同，然而××你知道，她的遭遇卻正和你的相彷。</p>
<p>是的，正如你所說，在初期，你和其他姊妹們裏被「物質享受」所麻醉了，想一想，在家裏是侷處在又小又髒的亭子間裏，終日受著後母的打罵，而忽然處身在輝煌的華麗的舞臺裏，那音樂，那燈光，那幾回，更有，那客人所帶你去游賞，或則說得透澈些，那些，所謂「上流」舞客把他們的奢侈生活，汽車，酒樓，旅館，百貨公司，高樓大廈帶一點驕傲地炫耀給你時，你麻醉了，再加上「上流」舞客的白亮亮的金錢夾著哄騙，你更麻醉了，麻醉得把你的貞操葬送掉。</p>
<p>我很瞭解你，××，當你說男人可以玩弄女人，女人也未嘗不可以玩弄男人，利用男人，但是隨即你又說，然而，女人卻遭首先天的限制，生產，和容易衰老，你曾親眼看見某一個同伴爲打胎而死掉了，你曾親眼看見某一個同們爲了色衰而被人拋棄。</p>
<p>對的，爲什麽，同樣的人，你卻要來充當舞女呢？爲什麽在這個社會裏，舞女要被人玩弄，蹂躪，同時被輕視呢？××，你自己很快地回答了這個問題，是誰把你的家毀滅了？是誰把你的父兄殺死了？是誰逼得你，逼得許多姊妹充當舞女？是誰？</p>
<p>「花濺淚」雖限於客觀環境，不能暢所欲言，但是如果我所扮演的米米能夠影響或覺醒許多在舞國裏的姊妹，去怎樣度一個有意義，有價值的生活，那麽不僅是我自己會欣喜，我想你也將感到慶幸了！敬祝努力！</p>
<h3>關於「花濺淚」</h3>
<p>— 夏霞</p>
<p>記得那是在一個晚上，我排完了「花濺淚」回到家來，一個朋友找我來閑談，外邊是下著細雨，那雨點打在涼台上是很清楚的，讓我們聽見，我的朋友問我：『你對於「花濺淚」這個劇本有什麽感想呢？我低著頭輕輕的回答他，我覺得太好了。』</p>
<p>是的，我覺得這是一個好戲，不，不，我簡直覺得這不是一個戲，—是事實，是眞實的暴露，你們看好了在每天的報紙上，類似這種事太多了，我想—請原諒我這個不懂藝術的人亂說—藝術的作品是不應該離開事實太遠的，尤其是在現在這種大時代中，藝術的作品越是接近事實越是富於眞實的感情，而牠的價值也越高。想起杜甫（花濺淚原是杜甫的一首詩的名字）這位詩聖，爲什麽他的詩讓人那麽祟拜呢？不就是因爲他的詩完全是把握住了眞實的事實，完全是眞情的流露嗎？—請再原諒我也不懂詩文在胡說。</p>
<p>「花濺淚」中一共有四個舞女，四個不同典型的舞女，我替小妹哭，我爲曼麗愁，我同情米米，我敬佩丁香。我雖演的是丁香，但是其輿三個人的影子，也時常在我腦子裏旋轉，我常常心裏想，是誰造成這會中這些不平的悲劇呢？</p>
<p>說到劇本，不由得想到于伶先生這位熱情的劇作家，很榮幸的我已經飾演過不少次他筆下的人物了，雖然我不配，也不敢說我了解他，但卻禁不住我欽佩他：我欽佩他那爲大衆落淚的情感，爲大衆流汗的精神，他每每的暴露了社會中那些黑暗醜惡的角落，他永遠的是爲那些被壓迫者呐喊呼號，我們都知道他還藏了一肚子沒有說出來的話—見花濺淚序—那麽爲了他，也是爲了我們自己，希望他能將話盡量說出的日子快快的來臨吧！</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第三回　仰遺容追思老義士　開文盲問字小先生</p>
<p>金澹雲等送了何家兩位小姐到旅館裏，她們就留這一對未婚夫婦，用了夜飯，方讓他們回去。那旅館裏就不同白天那個陵村餐室，便要華奢得多了。而且這又是一家很大的旅館，色色都全，因爲外國人在那旅館裏，也住得很多。他們有好幾個餐室，有中餐室，有西餐室。中餐有中國各處的菜，烹調不同。西餐有世界各國之菜，也是口味各別。就因爲這個旅館，有中國各處以及世界各國的人，常常住在那裏的。今天何家兩位小姐，是請他們吃西餐，走到第四層的西餐室來。那也是一間大廣間，足可容五六百人。每客西餐也並不算貴，只有一元五角，小賬是現在全中國都沒有的了。不過通常都不備酒，要是吃酒，那就貴得可怕，這便是因爲國家對於酒稅澀重的緣故。大約住居這旅館的人，吃西餐的也分幾個階級，自每客一元起至每客三元半止。普通的就是每客一元，菜也頗爲豐富。三元半的除非是外國人纔吃這樣的西餐，或者是中國人宴享貴賓，纔能用此。今天何家小姐請金澹雲吃一元半的西餐，已經是很豐美的了。他們坐定了以後，金澹雲就問：『明天一定動身到自由村嗎？』何雙玉道：『明天一定去了。本該是早去的，因爲父親沒有動身，這裏有許多事，我們要幫著父親。愛人也寫過信來，問了我們幾次，我們今天早晨，已經打了個電報給她了。』金澹雲道：『那末你們明天坐什麽車子去呢？火車也可以去，汽車也可以去，你們決定了嗎？』何儷玉道：『我們已經問過的了，倘是坐汽車去，可以直達自由村，無須換車。倘是坐火車去，我們先到了蘇州，然後再到自由村。從蘇州到自由村，有汽車也有汽船，那是便當得很的。我們因爲沒有坐過這裏的火車，藉以觀光一下，所以想坐了火車到蘇州，再作計較。也許愛人姊到蘇州來，迎接我們，也論不定。不過她事情很忙，我們卻敎她不要來。』金澹雲道：『原來如此！可惜我也爲職務所限，不然，我也就陪了你們，也到自由村去游玩一番了。不過你們什麽時候因到上海來呢？』說著，她望了林建成笑了一笑。　（三三）</p>

<h3>一九三八年度之十大鉅片錄</h3>
<p>— 華全生</p>
<p>每年的鉅片選舉，在美國是視爲非常重要的大事的。所以每至歲春暮，各電影機關及電影雜誌，便都亟亟從事於所謂「十大鉅片」的選舉。不過，選舉的目的雖相同，而選舉的方式，卻各有不同。有的自己開會審查而選出，有的公開徵求讀者們的意見而決定；這裏就是紐約National　Board　of　Review年會選舉的結果，且已揭示於去年十二月三十日出版的Motion　Picture　Herald雜誌上了。</p>
<p>該會的選舉方法，卻和別人不同。它是分三種方式的：（一）選出十部純粹英語對白的影片。（二）再選出六部用各國方言對白的影片。（三）因爲由以上二種方式選出的片子，不能完全是本國（美國）的出品，所以再選出完全好萊塢的影片十部。現在先說第一種及第三種的結果如下：</p>
<p>（甲）純粹英語對白之十大鉅片。</p>
<p>（一）The　Citadel.（米高梅）—係山勞勃杜奈及羅絲玲璐珊兒主演。尚未上映。</p>
<p>（二）白雪公主，（雷電華）全部卡通。</p>
<p>（三）The　Beachcomber.（派拉蒙）—尚未開映。</p>
<p>（四）To　the　Victor（高蒙）—尚未上映。</p>
<p>（五）駒影歌聲，（派拉蒙）。</p>
<p>（六）Edge　of　the　World.（Pax公司出品）—尚未上映。（註）</p>
<p>（七）敎子，（米高梅）。</p>
<p>（八）紅衫淚痕，（華納第一國家）。</p>
<p>（九）South　Riding.（倫敦公司出品，聯美發行）—由Ralph　Richardson及Edna　Best主演。尚未上映。</p>
<p>（十）生死同心，（米高梅）。</p>
<p>（乙）完全是美國出品的十大鉅片：</p>
<p>（一）白雪公主，（雷電華）—全部卡通。</p>
<p>（二）The　Citadel.（米高梅），尚未上映。</p>
<p>（三）浮生若夢，（哥倫比亞）</p>
<p>（四）Boys　Town（米高梅）—由史本塞屈賽及秘蓋羅納主演。尚未開映。</p>
<p>（五）絕代艷后，（米高梅）。</p>
<p>（六）樂府滄桑，（二十世紀福斯）。</p>
<p>（七）羅賓漢，（華納第一國家）。</p>
<p>（八）海角游魂，（聯美）。</p>
<p>（九）芝加哥大火記，（二十世紀福斯）。</p>
<p>（十）四千金（華納第一國家。）</p>
<p>在這張黃榜式的名單裏，去年的四部加價獻映的鉅片—即第五，六，七，九等四部—卻都在其中，這倒是很難得的巧遇了。</p>
<p>至於第二種方式的六大鉅片，其中有的是法國片，有的是俄國片（因爲所謂「各國方言」者，其實即係外國片之謂。）而且大都是不會到上海來開映的，所以從略不錄。不過去年在國泰開映轟動一時的蘇聯鉅處「彼得大帝」“Peter　the　Great”在這次選舉中，被選爲第二種方式的六大鉅片中的第五名。這卻是值得向讀者們報告的。</p>
<p>—註—Pax公司之名，從未聽見；恐係好萊塢一小公司之流。</p>
<h3>余叔岩王牠林之「問樵」</h3>
<h3>藝林三次公演中咖啡店之一夜</h3>
<p>— 冰獨</p>
<p>藝林劇社在星期日上午，假卡爾登作第三次公演，一共有三個獨幕劇：糕與餅「除夕」和「咖啡店之一夜」，而其中則以第三個戲成績最佳。</p>
<p>「咖啡店之一夜」是田漢先生早期的劇本，由胡旭東先生擔任導演，這個戲在目前「抗戰八股」的時代裏也許顯得欠現實一點，但劇作者是並不爲了這個時代而寫，它是反映那時候年青人侈談戀愛與封建環境之悲慘情形，特別是「咖啡店之一夜」的寫出，還在話劇事業開始萌芽的時候，話成果的對象的確祗限於一部分，較之現在更要少上十倍的年青男女們，當倡導婚姻自由打破賣買制度的新思想流入這個古老的社會中時，田漢先生非常憤慨，財情那些被犧牲著的無辜者，於是窮秀才的女兒白秋英就因了爭求自己終身的幸福而背家出走，在咖啡店中作侍女，用她的汗血掙錢生活；而且希望在自立以後把積蓄再去讀書，以求維持她和富家子錢少爺的戀愛，那正是田漢先生的理想而且指示給青年們的新戀愛典型，一方面把錢少爺—一個封建自私的廢物也予以忠實的剝露，當兩人在咖啡店中割愛時，他就說出：</p>
<p>「請你原諒，我是個弱者，」「我的父親是個紳宦，怎好把一個咖啡店的侍女作媳婦，就是我也……」相反地他又風趣地把自己化成了一個林澤奇，先用白秋英處女神聖天眞的熱情救甦了這麽個頽廢感傷的藝術家，而後又相反的在白秋英失戀以後用同樣的詞語熱情去規勸：「人生是一片沙漠，行旅者是需要甘泉的」，我幾乎爲他底熱情所興奮了。</p>
<p>全劇效果甚佳，因了一個成功的劇本，人物性格把握的明顯，導演和演員也盡了相當的努力，這個戲便成了第三次演出中最可愛的一個，雖然我也明白在目前這個戲的範圍，未免太狹小了些，但在藝術的立塲上，鬧著劇本荒的狀態下，我是不是惜予以鼓勵的。</p>
<h3>銀壇列車</h3>
<p>— 薏</p>
<p>留滬編導二十輿人，近聯席議決，於必要時全體入川，且已有數人，將先行啟程矣。</p>
<p>路明自云決於今年生辰之宴席上，確定彼之心上人，據傳內定者有導演，錄音師，影評人，男明星，音樂家，和一個已有妻子的劇作者。</p>
<p>吳村近爲國華公司編製獻金濟難劇本，暫名「花聲淚痕」，並選定　秋霞·洪逗·舒適及由昆明返滬之　稼農任主角。　秋霞特爲此劇就美容院施手術，姿首較前愈嫵媚較好，亦一九三九年頭之銀壇大事也</p>
<p>愚國路底之「夜花圈」有不少明星在那邊遊玩「蘋草木」戲。</p>
<p>顧梅君顧蘭君，昨同至梅蘭花店小憩，一時顧客雲集，售去梅花六十輿盆。</p>
<p>黃嘉謨爲陳雲裳寫「雲裳仙子」，已脫稿，聞將繼續與韓蘭根·殷秀岑·劉繼羣寫「三劍客」，此君噱頭軟性，前途光明。</p>
<p>夏霞·周起·陳歌辛·參加懷久師範話劇，出演於寗波同鄉會。</p>
<p>百代公司最新電影歌曲「花一秀的夢」「春風野草」「玫瑰花開」已出售，成績甚佳。該公司灌音部主任，現爲傅祥巽，待人接物，澀和藹可親。</p>
<p>王引與袁美雲將合演「隋宮春色」，由張善琨自任編導，亦新華之刺激新聞也。</p>
<p>藝華公司努力搜羅新人運動，某大導演及南國新星與大批技術人員，均在秘密接洽中</p>
<p>明星公司準備恢復自己製片，但不在上海發行。傳胡蝶將爲第一片主角云。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（九八）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>老譚問劉鴻聲怎麼死法</p>
<p>今天見他前來聽戲，就料定是來「摘毛」的啦。（摘毛即挑剔找毛病的意思）當時就有人跑進後台向管事的一說，不多時劉跛到來，也知道譚老板在前台啦，他心裏想道：這個老棒子（即老東西）今天前來，必定不懷好意。所以他自始至終，都是鄭重其事的唱作。老譚聽了，有時搖頭，有時點頭，即令有一兩位熟朋友問他怎樣？他也不加批評。及至最後楊六郎歸天時所唱「無常到萬事休去見先人」時，老譚忽然把桌子一拍說：「我看你怎麼死法？」說罷站起就走。後來有人問他此話怎講？他才說道：「別的戲可以賣賣嗓子，這齣戲是病人要死時所唱，不想他最末一句，還使高音，拉牠腔，當然是死不了啦。照情理說這一句唱到「萬事休」攝像機字時簡直要同臨死的人提氣一樣，向裏吸的氣就不如向外抽的氣多，當然氣息奄奄，聲音細微，等到唱「去見先人」四字時，只能一個字一個字的斷續唸出，也無所謂行腔使調了。再者說凡是戲裏臨死的唱作，都澀不容易，所以作工裏也是「作死」鼓難，況且死與死的情形，又各有不同。譬如說「南天門」是凍死，「李陵碑」是碰死，射死，和毒發而死，都是急遽的羹，倒還容易，「烏盆記」最末一句「陰曹地府走一番」，有時也可用個「掃頭」就此截斷，不唱下去，「焚綿山」不唱光作，況有松香煙火幫助表作，也不覺甚難。獨是「南天門」「洪羊洞」這兩齣戲，須得唱著死，並且最後這一句，又不能刪去，所以唱的高啦快啦全不合適。劉跛只曉得賣嗓子，豈知道齣戲就根本不是用乙字調的高嗓門能唱得好的。我們唱戲，最要緊的就是不對工的戲，千萬不要硬學硬唱。他唱這齣「洪羊洞」，就是犯了這個不對工的毛病，故而我要問他怎樣死法？」這段話後來傳到鴻聲耳裏，他也非常佩服，從此也就不唱這戲。</p>

<h3>Containing the Japanese Army's Attempt to Invade Westward from Heshan: Chinese Forces Deploy a Strong Defensive Formation. Remaining Japanese Troops Near Ge Wei (阁尾) in Sanshui Have Been Annihilated. Japanese Troops are Concentrating on Weizhou Island, Intending to Use it as a Key Base.</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: The war situation in the West River area has been relatively quiet for the past two days. However, Japanese troops near Jiujiang seem to be making suspicious movements. Major Chinese forces have arrived at a certain location and</p>
<p>have deployed a strong defensive formation to control the Japanese army's attempt to invade westward from Heshan along the Gaoyao-Gaoming highway. After the Sanshui position was attacked by Chinese guerrillas,</p>
<p>a large fire broke out. Furthermore, Japanese troops are concentrating forces from the Guang-San (Guangzhou-Sanshui) and Jiang-Fo (Jiangmen-Foshan) roads to the areas of Makou and Yangmei in Sanshui, seemingly planning to first attack Sihui</p>
<p>and then advance westward towards Zhaoqing. According to reports received by Chinese authorities, the Japanese army's advance along the West River is aimed at concealing their conspiracy to invade Guilin from the south.</p>
<p>It is reported that there are over 20,000 Japanese troops on Weizhou Island, using the island as a base for invading southern Guangdong. (Sixth Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Sihui: According to reports, the remaining Japanese troops near Ge Wei (阁尾) in Sanshui have been annihilated by Chinese forces. Currently, there are no traces of Japanese troops on the opposite bank of Sanshui. (Fifth Day)</p>
<p>Guangzhou: The situation here is</p>
<p>slightly better than before. Therefore,</p>
<p>the restrictions on Chinese people entering</p>
<p>Shamian (沙面) have been partially lifted.</p>
<p>Chinese people can now enter and exit</p>
<p>the Shamian concession between 9:00 AM and 4:00 PM</p>
<p>without having to show a pass. However,</p>
<p>restrictions are still in place in the city.</p>
<p>Japanese sentries continue</p>
<p>to be stationed at the intersections of certain streets,</p>
<p>searching passing Chinese people</p>
<p>and checking the passes of foreigners. The "Maintenance Committee" here</p>
<p>has started organizing a new police force, as there has been no "police" since</p>
<p>Guangzhou fell. The committee recently issued</p>
<p>a notice, summoning all former police officers</p>
<p>to register for possible employment. (</p>

<p>for the Central Daily News reports that,</p>
<p>according to reliable sources,</p>
<p>although Japan recently declared</p>
<p>a large-scale offensive from Beihai,</p>
<p>hoping for peace, this offensive</p>
<p>seems unlikely to materialize temporarily. Japan</p>
<p>feels deeply isolated diplomatically and has therefore decided to adopt</p>
<p>a neutral policy, relying on Germany and Italy</p>
<p>for support. On February 3, Japanese Foreign Minister</p>
<p>Arita, in response to a question in the Diet</p>
<p>regarding the convening of an</p>
<p>international conference, stated that if the</p>
<p>international situation continues to deteriorate and other</p>
<p>countries still fail to understand Japan's policies,</p>
<p>then Japan will have to reconsider its</p>
<p>attitude. If any country other than the Soviet Union</p>
<p>attacks Japan, then Japan will</p>
<p>rise to the challenge. (Fifth Day Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<p>Xi'an: The Japanese army attacking Zhongtiao Mountain suffered a major setback after being resisted by Chinese forces for several days. The Chinese Air Force also cooperated with the ground forces in the battle. On the 5th,</p>
<p>in the afternoon, several Chinese aircraft flew to bombard Japanese positions in southern Shanxi, dropping dozens of bombs on Japanese positions on both sides of the Tongpu (Datong-Puzhou) Railway, all of which hit their targets.</p>

<p>Chongqing: When the Japanese army occupied Liaoxian,</p>
<p>they expressed optimism about the success</p>
<p>of their operation to suppress guerrillas in southeastern Shanxi. The Communist Party's</p>

<p>too optimistic too early. Liaoxian, located seventy li</p>
<p>southeast of Taiyuan, fell into the hands</p>
<p>of the Japanese army on January 30.</p>
<p>On February 3, after the Eighth Route Army</p>
<p>adopted a strategy of cutting off the flanks and ambushing the rear,</p>
<p>it had already been retaken by the Chinese army.</p>
<p>The Japanese army in Liaoxian had already retreated twenty</p>
<p>li north towards Heshun. After two short</p>
<p>hours of fierce fighting, the Eighth Route Army completely</p>
<p>annihilated the left flank of the Japanese army with</p>
<p>ambush tactics. At the end of last month, when the Japanese army occupied</p>
<p>Heshun and Liaoxian, they first used</p>
<p>poison gas. In the last week</p>
<p>of January, the use of poison gas by the Japanese army</p>
<p>resulted in 500 casualties for the Eighth Route Army.</p>
<p>Currently, the Eighth Route Army has Heshun surrounded.</p>
<p>The Japanese army's initial plan for operations in southeastern Shanxi</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Inflation of the Japanese Paper Currency Under Expanding War Expenditure</h3>
<p>News reports indicate that Japan's special military budget for the next fiscal year will be 5.4 billion yen. If</p>
<p>this is combined with the general accounting budget for the next fiscal year, then the financial expenditure that the Japanese people should</p>
<p>bear in the coming year will exceed 9 billion.</p>
<p>Since the July 7th Incident, up to this fiscal year, the war expenditure consumed by Japan, excluding</p>
<p>the ordinary accounting, has totaled a staggering 7.4 billion, which is almost</p>
<p>entirely made up for by public bonds. Therefore, to estimate the state of Japan's financial collapse next year,</p>
<p>one only needs to estimate the situation of public bond planning in the past to get a rough idea.</p>
<p>Japan's method of issuing public bonds has, up to now, arguably become just another way of increasing</p>
<p>paper currency issuance. The public bonds that Japan should issue this fiscal year amount to over 6 billion,</p>
<p>but by the end of November last year, only 3.6 billion had been absorbed.</p>
<p>Of this, 2.8 billion had been bought by various banks and insurance companies,</p>
<p>while the rest was in the hands of the Bank of Japan. The purchase of public bonds by banks and insurance companies</p>
<p>is not due to an increase in Japan's wealth. Statistics show that Japan's total</p>
<p>savings recently, due to the effects of currency inflation, have increased compared to before, but</p>
<p>the number of loans granted has relatively decreased sharply, showing that the power of Japanese banks and insurance companies</p>
<p>to purchase public bonds has all been transferred from the loaning sector. In other words,</p>
<p>the underwriting of public bonds by Japanese banks and insurance companies has already encroached upon their usable</p>
<p>capacity; they are simply unable to refuse to purchase under the compulsion of the government.</p>
<p>Even under these compulsory circumstances, Japan has only issued</p>
<p>a portion of the public bonds it should have issued, and the amount of public bonds held by the Bank of Japan</p>
<p>is still increasing day by day. The Bank of Japan's method of coping with this is simply to increase the amount of paper currency. This</p>
<p>can be seen from Japan's recent issuance and absorption of paper currency.</p>
<p>The issuance of Japanese paper currency has always been divided into two parts: one part is gold reserves,</p>
<p>and the other part is security reserves. Before the war, the Bank of Japan held 500 million</p>
<p>yen in gold, and the issuance limit under the name of security reserves was 1 billion yen. Therefore, the Bank of Japan's</p>
<p>paper currency issuance was about 1.5 billion yen at most. After the outbreak of the war, Japan</p>
<p>soon revalued its gold reserves, expanding the gold held by the Bank of Japan from 500 million</p>
<p>to over 1 billion yen due to the increased valuation. After this valuation,</p>
<p>the gold under the Japanese paper currency issuance was falsely expanded to 800 million yen, most of</p>
<p>which was used for the purchase of raw materials overseas under the name of "special accounting."</p>
<p>In reality, this was another trick to increase issuance.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the value of gold was raised by surreptitious means to expand the paper currency issuance</p>
<p>under the name of gold reserves. On the other hand, the public bonds issued for security reserves</p>
<p>were expanded from 1 billion yen to 1.7 billion yen, allowing the Bank of Japan to buy more public bonds.</p>
<p>From this time on, the Bank of Japan's issuance amount had expanded from 1.7 billion</p>
<p>in the past to 2.5 billion.</p>
<p>Due to the difficulty in absorbing public bonds, the issuance of Japanese paper currency has been increasingly inflated, and</p>
<p>at the same time, due to the panic of domestic resources, it is impossible not to export gold again! Thus, the gold held</p>
<p>by the Bank of Japan must be turned over again, which is the 300 million yen in gold turned over in June last year under the name of a foreign exchange fund.</p>
<p>From that time on, gold reserves decreased, but the issuance of paper currency did not decrease.</p>
<p>By the end of last year, due to various factors such as the expansion of financial expenses, Japan's</p>
<p>paper currency had expanded to 2.8 billion. According to Japan's existing security reserves,</p>
<p>only 1.7 billion are allowed, and the gold reserves are only 500 million. Then, the Bank of Japan's</p>
<p>total issuance limit is 2.2 billion. Now, the issuance has reached 2.8 billion,</p>
<p>which is more than 600 million yen beyond the limit, isn't it? Isn't that equal to the amount of public bonds that the Bank of Japan cannot issue?</p>
<p>In reality, the existence of gold in Japan has long been a question. Even if we believe</p>
<p>it exists, but as said above, Japan's increase in public bonds has reached the highest limit of compulsory purchase.</p>
<p>The future trend will be nothing more than directly increasing the issuance of paper currency. The over-issuance of paper currency</p>
<p>is to use blank paper to plunder the people's strength, which means the last path on the financial</p>
<h3>No Different Than Engaging in War with Two Countries Simultaneously: The Opinion of American Mr. Fitch</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, Mr. Fitch, Secretary of the Chinese Youth Association here, stated in a speech to over 400 people that although American manufacturers have indeed stopped supplying Japan with munitions, they are still transporting large quantities of cotton, iron, gasoline, and other war necessities to Japan. This is no different from China fighting both Japan and the United States simultaneously. He expressed his hope that the U.S. Congress would pass legislation to prohibit the shipment of the aforementioned goods to Japan. He stated that the reason American merchants sell these goods to Japan is solely due to ignorance and profit-seeking. It is noted that Mr. Fitch is an American born in China, has dedicated himself to social work for many years, and has a considerable reputation. He previously served as a director of the refugee zone when Nanjing fell. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Washington Air Mail</p>
<p>President Roosevelt submitted a national defense message to Congress, advocating the appropriation of a huge sum of $2,000,000,000 to expand military preparedness. This is also clear evidence that the U.S. foreign policy is becoming increasingly active. As a result, China will be the first to benefit, and the path of its development will be that the United Kingdom and the United States have, in fact, established a consultative relationship in the Far East. To give a recent example, the U.S. government issued a strong note to Japan on December 31 of last year, opposing the so-called "New Order in East Asia." The United Kingdom followed suit, issuing a similar note on the 14th of last month. At the same time, the U.S. has lent China a large sum of $25,000,000, and the United Kingdom has also granted China a credit loan of £500,000. The American Berranca Aircraft Corporation has also signed a contract with the Chinese government to manufacture 200 bombers. In addition, Secretary of State Hull exerted strong pressure last summer to dissuade American aircraft companies from supplying aircraft to Japan, and all but United Aircraft Corporation have complied. According to the Bureau of Munitions Control, United Aircraft Corporation sold Japan components in December of last year, including 600 propellers, worth $102,000. In this report, it is clearly stated that United Aircraft Corporation is the only merchant that disregards the State Department's admonition. This is also a moral sanction, unprecedented in the past. (Note: United Aircraft Corporation has recently declared that it will accept the State Department's admonition and no longer sell aircraft to Japan.) The U.S. government hopes that aircraft companies will no longer supply aircraft to Japan. This policy was announced by Secretary of State Hull to reporters on June 11 of last year. At the time, it was not considered unusual. It was not until July 1 that the Bureau of Munitions Control issued a report stating that the State Department had also issued a public letter to "all manufacturers and exporters of aircraft and aircraft parts, stating that in accordance with the policy announced on June 11, the State Department does not wish to authorize the export of various aircraft, military equipment installed on aircraft, aircraft engines, medical accessories, aircraft bombs, and aerial torpedoes, which are sold to foreign countries and used by the military to bomb civilians." All of these measures are worthy of attention. In addition, the report also stated that the total value of U.S. arms exports last year was $94,209,432, more than double the $45,076,316 in 1937. The majority of these were aircraft. Buyers included not only China and Japan, but also the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland, the Dutch East Indies, and Argentina. The main exporters and the value of the goods they sold are roughly as follows: (1) Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, sold $24,048,639; (2) Glenn Martin Company, sold $11,339,339; Curtiss-Wright Corporation, sold $10,880,567; North American Aviation, sold $9,927,014. What is particularly noteworthy is that the aircraft companies are planning to double their manufacturing output this year, in accordance with the needs of President Roosevelt's military preparedness plan, in order to increase the total number of aircraft to 9,000. According to a survey by Rogers, President of the Aircraft Industries Association, existing U.S. aircraft factories only need to hire more workers and add more tools to increase production to 5,500 aircraft per year. In terms of last year's situation, the U.S. manufactured a total of 3,675 aircraft of various types, of which 1,800 were military aircraft, including those exported. According to Rogers, "Some say that the manufacturing capacity of U.S. aircraft factories has reached its maximum limit, but in fact, it is far from it, because some factories have not actually started production. Therefore, in the early part of last year, the average monthly production of military aircraft was 150, which gradually increased, and has now reached 200 per month. If the number of existing employees is doubled, it is not difficult to manufacture 500 aircraft per month." (Havas)</p>

<p>(London) Well-informed diplomatic circles here believe that after the fall of Catalonia, another stage has clearly been demarcated. It is expected that Italy and Germany will exert diplomatic pressure on Britain and France, requesting them to make concessions. Although the Fascist Supreme Council's meeting on Saturday and Sunday did not mention Italy's demands on France, observers in diplomatic circles here believe that the Supreme Council decided at its meeting on Friday that Italy may begin activities, attempting to make demands regarding the administration of Djibouti, Tunisia, and the Suez.

<p>(London) Reuters has learned that the Spanish Republican government has contacted the British government to mediate the civil war. Although no official note has been sent to General Franco, the Nationalist Army has rejected mediation. The United Kingdom is working closely with France to take steps to stop the senseless bloodshed in Spain. As for the nature of these steps, it is currently unknown. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After the sudden turn of events in the Spanish civil war, it is reported that the Republican government proposed peace to the Nationalist government. According to the right-wing "Le Temps," "General Franco, the Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army, immediately rejected the peace proposal and opposed taking a referendum, demanding that the government army surrender completely. This reply was conveyed to the Republican government by the British Embassy on the afternoon of the 4th of this month. The Cabinet then held an important meeting, with divergent attitudes. Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Del Vayo both opposed surrender. As a result, rifts emerged within the Republican government. Yesterday, Foreign Minister Del Vayo went to Perpignan in southern France to have contacts with diplomats from the United Kingdom and France, and repeatedly spoke with officials from the foreign ministries of the United Kingdom and France by long-distance telephone."

It is said that Prime Minister Negrín will meet today with the country's Foreign Minister Del Vayo, French Ambassador to the Republican government Henri, and British Chargé d'Affaires to the Republican government Womack to discuss matters.

<p>(London) Informed sources have stated that Sir Walter Hodgson, the British Commercial Representative in Burgos, will return to his post in Burgos next week. He has a clear mission: to propose to the Spanish Nationalist government that the United Kingdom provide loans to carry out reconstruction work, such as building houses and purchasing railway materials and tractors, but with political and economic guarantees, namely: (1) this loan will be secured by Spanish customs revenue; (2) the Nationalist government should agree to send foreign combatants back to their countries and recognize the United Kingdom's position in Gibraltar; (3) British ships destroyed by Nationalist aircraft in ports under the jurisdiction of the Spanish Republican government should be compensated by the Nationalist Army; (4) most of the goods needed by Spain should be ordered from the United Kingdom; (5) Spanish industries that employ technicians from Italy and Germany should not be allowed to use British loans to develop. In short, the purpose of the above-mentioned loan is to enable the Spanish Nationalist Army to repay its debts to Italy, so as to eliminate Italian labor and replace it with British influence.

<p>French Moderate Senator Peral recently told a reporter from Havas News Agency, "I came here only to fully understand the recent situation in Spain. Although I have had contact with the Nationalist authorities, I have not been tasked with discussing any issues. Once I have observed the situation, I will return home and report to Foreign Minister Bonnet to report on my mission. If my country and the Nationalist government do have contacts in the future, I may come to Spain again. I am scheduled to meet again with General Jordana, the Foreign Minister of the Nationalist government, at noon today, or I may call Foreign Minister Bonnet by long-distance telephone from Saint-Jean-de-Luz in southern France afterwards."

<p>Professor Chen Yinque of Tsinghua University Appointed as Professor of Chinese at Oxford University</p>
<p>(London) Oxford University has recently appointed Chen Yinque as Professor of Chinese. Chen is the first Chinese person to become a professor at a British university. The Great Britain China Committee has long advocated for the appointment of Chinese people as professors of Chinese at universities. Hu Shi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, strongly recommended Mr. Chen for this position. Therefore, Oxford University made this decision. Chen, who is from Shaanxi and Gansu, is 47 years old and has studied at Harvard and various universities in Berlin and Paris. Chen has served as a history professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing for the past ten years. He is scheduled to come to Oxford in October to take office, with an annual salary of £850. Currently, the Chinese professorship at Oxford is temporarily held by Hughes. After Chen arrives, Hughes will become a Chinese teaching assistant. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Spanish Government Authorities: The Entirety Fleeing to France</p>
<p>Troops Contacted, Armed Retreat into French Territory: The Nationalist Army 20 Kilometers from the French Border</p>
<p>Perpignan</p>
<p>According to information coming from the border, all personnel of the Spanish Republican government are currently in French territory. It is estimated that 13,000 members of the Republican army have crossed the border. Many tanks and aircraft have already entered the country. It is expected that another 100,000 to 140,000 members of the Republican army will enter French territory successively and will be detained in concentration camps. Once the border obstacles are removed, refugees and defeated soldiers will enter the country in droves. All refugees must be inspected, and any concealed weapons will be confiscated. A total of 27 Republican army aircraft have now landed in French territory. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Argelès-sur-Mer</p>
<p>After the President of the Republican government went to France, Prime Minister Negrín and most of the cabinet members withdrew from Figueres on the evening of the 4th. The next day, they held a meeting a few kilometers from this town (that is, 15 kilometers from the French border) and decided to take all necessary measures to order the government army to retreat completely and to designate several troops to be transferred to the central region. In the future, the Republican government will choose one of Valencia, Murcia, and Cartagena as the temporary capital. (Havas, 6th)</p>

<p>President Azaña of the Spanish Republican government, Speaker of the House of Representatives Barrio, President of the Autonomous Region of Catalonia Companys, and President of the Autonomous Region of the Basque Country Aguirre crossed the French border in the department of Pyrénées-Orientales today and went to Paris. The Spanish Republican government authorities announced this evening that all government agencies had moved back to Valencia. President Azaña will stay in Paris for some time. In addition, officers and soldiers of the frontline government army in Catalonia are constantly fleeing to the French border and requesting entry. French border authorities are making arrangements to accommodate them and have agreed to accommodate 100,000 personnel. Once these officers and soldiers enter the country, they will be disarmed and sent to the detention camp in Argelès-sur-Mer. There are also many ordinary refugees from Spain fleeing into France. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republican government has established an office in this city specifically to handle registration procedures for these refugees and to help them find places to live in France. In addition, there are still thousands of refugees waiting to enter the country at the border. The French authorities will open the border and allow them to enter the country. (Havas, 5th)</p>
<p>Le Perthus</p>
<p>It was rumored that Negrín, the Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican government, had taken a plane from Figueres in northern Spain to Valencia. It has been learned that this is not true. He entered the French border at 3:15 this morning, along with ministers without portfolio Hoz, Juste, Taylor, Minister of Education Blanco, Minister of Justice Bena, and Minister of Interior Gómez, in eight cars. The roofs of the cars were covered with mattresses and leather bags to prevent air raids. The guards they brought were disarmed upon entry. The first group of soldiers of the government army also crossed the border at 4:35. Afterwards, a large number of soldiers came one after another. After being disarmed by the French border guards, they were sent to the detention camp in Brouilla for temporary accommodation. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Difficult Mediation by Britain and France: Divergent Opinions Within the Spanish Government</p>
<p>(London) French Ambassador Corbin visited Foreign Secretary Halifax this morning to discuss the recent situation in Spain. According to British diplomatic circles, the British and French governments have maintained close contact and are willing to do everything in their power to promote the cessation of senseless bloodshed in Spain. The large number of Spanish refugees and soldiers seeking refuge in France has placed a heavy burden on the country, which was also discussed with the Foreign Secretary. However, he declined to specify whether a concrete plan for mediating the civil war had been formulated. According to well-informed sources, although the proposal to end the civil war in Spain has been put forward, the Spanish Nationalist Army has won a complete victory on the Catalan front, and many of the Spanish Republican government authorities have sought refuge in France. Under these circumstances, attempts at "mediation" are bound to be difficult. For example, the terms of peace proposed yesterday by Negrín, the Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican government, are rumored to have been rejected by General Franco, the Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army. Although this has not been officially confirmed, it is to be expected. Generally speaking, the British government is willing to contact both parties involved in the Spanish civil war as soon as an opportunity arises, in order to study the future situation in that country. This is foreseeable. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) French Ambassador Corbin visited the Foreign Office this morning. The discussion was mainly about mediating the civil war in Spain. According to well-informed sources, Del Vayo, the Foreign Minister of the Spanish Republican government, had a meeting with Henri, the French Ambassador to Spain, and Stephenson, the British Chargé d'Affaires to Spain, yesterday. It is reported that Foreign Minister Del Vayo requested that the United Kingdom and France propose peace to General Franco, the Commander-in-Chief of the Nationalist Army. The conditions are: (1) both sides should cease hostilities; (2) the territorial integrity of Spain should be maintained; (3) the Nationalist Army should abandon all means of retaliation. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The British and French governments are constantly consulting on the issue of ending the Spanish civil war, but they have encountered considerable difficulties. Since France has no representative stationed in Burgos, Spain, and has recently sent the moderate senator Peral, it can only be regarded as the starting point for establishing relations between France and the Spanish Nationalist government. Therefore, it is very difficult for France to mediate between the two parties in the Spanish civil war. Moreover, the opinions among the authorities of the Spanish Republican government are quite inconsistent, which is also one of the reasons why the United Kingdom and France have failed to respond quickly to the situation. Originally, Azaña, the President of the Republican government, who has always been known as a representative of the bourgeoisie, advocated ending the war. However, Negrín, the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, insisted on continuing the war. President Azaña has now taken refuge in France and will come to Paris in a short period of time. However, it is unknown what plans Prime Minister Negrín has. In addition, people from the Spanish Nationalist Army here claim that General Miaja, the commander of the central region of the government army (whose headquarters are in Madrid), is negotiating with a certain general of the Nationalist Army. However, people from the Republican government have denied this. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>Chamberlain Warns: Britain and France Cooperate Closely</p>
<p>If France's Vital Interests are Threatened, the United Kingdom Will Defend Them with All its Strength</p>
<p>(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Henderson, a member of the opposition Labour Party, asked Prime Minister Chamberlain about the relationship between the United Kingdom and France. French Foreign Minister Bonnet recently stated in the House of Deputies, "If a war breaks out in the future, the United Kingdom will assist France with all its forces, just as France will assist the United Kingdom with all its forces. This statement is in line with the views of the British government." Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "As far as I know, Foreign Minister Bonnet said that if the United Kingdom and France are both involved in a war in the future, the United Kingdom will assist France with all its forces, just as France will assist the United Kingdom with all its forces. This is completely consistent with the views of the British government. Although it is difficult to predict all the events that may occur in the future, since the interests of the United Kingdom and France are the same, if the vital interests of France are threatened, no matter where this threat comes from, the United Kingdom must cooperate with France immediately. This is what I should make clear." All the members applauded in approval. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Italian Extortion Again on the Issue of Withdrawing Volunteers: The Nationalist Army's Intention is Still Insufficient, Saying That Political Victory Must Be Obtained First</p>
<p>(London) The Balearic Islands in the Spanish Mediterranean, which are centered on Mallorca and Menorca, have been controlled by Italy on Mallorca, which is now in the hands of the Nationalist Army, for more than a day. Menorca, however, is still held by the Spanish Republican government. According to a dispatch from the Rome correspondent of The Times, "According to recent signs, Menorca is likely to become Italy's second target. The Italian Air Force stationed in Mallorca flew over Menorca yesterday, dropping leaflets advising residents to surrender to the Nationalist Army. The Italian newspapers' correspondents in Spain are quite optimistic about this, believing that the Nationalist Army will not encounter major resistance if it attacks Menorca. However, the actual situation is not so simple. Menorca's defenses are very strong. If the Nationalist Army's fleet blockades the island from the sea, it is also difficult to enter the island's territorial waters within three nautical miles. However, French ships, under the cover of their warships, can easily sail to the island to refuel. Therefore, Menorca not only has the potential to resist stubbornly, but also can cause new disputes between France and Italy. The impact of this delicate situation is unimaginable."

<p>Rome</p>
<p>After a two-hour meeting on Saturday night, the Fascist Supreme Council issued a communiqué stating that Italian volunteers would not withdraw from Spain until the Nationalist Army had achieved complete victory. Yesterday, all Italian newspapers unanimously praised this communiqué. "Il Popolo d'Italia" published an article by Mr. Gayda, stating that the Fascist Supreme Council discussed diplomatic events on Saturday night. At that time, the world was waiting for the remarks of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to end the forum started by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and German leader Hitler. At that time, there was indeed a speech, but it was only for the reference of those attending the Supreme Council and not for public criticism. In this article, Gayda attacked President Roosevelt extensively, saying that since the omnipotent state has been repeatedly attacked, it can only reorganize its army and prepare to defend itself. Italy is prepared to defend itself with all the power of itself and its comrade state, Germany. German leader Hitler has repeatedly stated in his recent speeches that Germany and Italy are united not only in ideology and politics, but also militarily. Gayda also published an article in "Il Giornale d'Italia," stating that the Italian troops fighting in Spain will not withdraw until the Red Army and its friends have completely eliminated their destructive forces. The Red Army is currently engaged in reorganization in the area bordering Spain and is receiving shelter and assistance. Therefore, the victory of General Franco cannot be said to be complete until the final work of eliminating the Red Army in Spain and the bordering area has been implemented. Now, new diplomatic pressure and interference are in progress in order to harm the Spanish Nationalist Army. Therefore, Germany and Italy cannot withdraw their assistance to Franco. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Mr. Geyda, a famous Italian reporter who has always been regarded as the mouthpiece of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, commented on the communiqué issued by the Fascist Party's Supreme Council in an article published in "Il Popolo d'Italia" yesterday, stating that Italian volunteers in Spain must obtain a political victory in addition to a military victory for the Spanish Nationalist Army before they can be withdrawn. British politicians have paid close attention to this and said that when Prime Minister Chamberlain visited Rome last month, Prime Minister Mussolini assured him that Italian volunteers would be completely withdrawn as soon as the Spanish civil war ended. Mr. Geyda's words are in contradiction with this assurance. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Mr. Geyda, a famous Italian reporter, published an article in "Il Popolo d'Italia" yesterday, which has had a reaction in Britain. Geyda's comments on the communiqué issued by the Fascist Party's Supreme Council, stating that Italian volunteers in Spain must obtain a political victory in addition to a military victory for the Spanish Nationalist Army before they can be withdrawn, etc., have been commented on by "The Daily Telegraph" (formerly known as the organ of former Foreign Secretary Eden), stating, "The political victory that Geyda is talking about refers to eradicating all 'inappropriate forces' within Spain and eliminating the 'Red Army' in the neighboring area (meaning France). However, it is impossible to predict when this kind of political victory will be achieved. Isn't it the case that Italian volunteers will occupy Spain for a long time? Based on this, what we have said before about the dictators' intervention in the Spanish civil war is not so much due to ideological reasons, but rather to strategic reasons for opposing France. The main goal is to weaken France's position in the Mediterranean in order to realize what Hitler wrote in his book 'Mein Kampf' about destroying French military power. Now, Geyda's words make us feel more convinced. However, Foreign Secretary Halifax said in the House of Commons yesterday, while acknowledging the tension in relations between France and Italy, that the relationship between Britain and Italy is still optimistic. It is difficult to understand this. The interests of France are largely consistent with those of Britain. The loss of lips and teeth is painful and related. Now that Italy is openly threatening France, how can the British government be complacent and say that it is on good terms with Italy? The dictators aim to separate Britain and France. It should be known that after France declines, Britain will immediately lose its natural ally. If that is the case, then those dictators will make the same harsh demands on Britain. This can be asserted." (Havas, 7th)</p>

Outsiders are surprised by the large number of sailors on Japanese submarines, because submarines in other countries do not have so many people. However, Japanese submarines often have many trainees on the deck, so the number of people is naturally higher than in other countries. (United Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Indian National Congress: Increasingly Left-Leaning, with a Strong Attitude Towards Britain</p>

<p>The political conference of the Bengal National Congress yesterday passed a resolution asking the All-India Congress to submit an aide-mémoire to the British government, limiting the British government to provide a substantial response to the demands of the Indian people within six months. If no response is received within six months or no satisfactory results are obtained, then the National Congress can freely take any action. The resolution also stated that India has the right to create its own constitution through a constitutional conference, and reiterated its firm opposition to the federal system. Since the election of left-leaning leader Bose as chairman of the Indian National Congress Party, the left-leaning forces have become increasingly strong. Now that this resolution has been passed, the National Congress's opposition to the federation is even stronger. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>After the resignation of the cabinet of Yugoslavian Prime Minister Stojadinović, Prince Paul, the Regent, ordered Dr. Cvijović, a member of the Radical Union and former Minister of Social Affairs, to form a new cabinet. It has now been established and the list is as follows:</p>

Politicians believe that the new cabinet will maintain the old diplomatic policy, while seeking good cooperation with the Croats in internal affairs, because the resignation of the previous cabinet was caused by the opposition of that ethnic group.

<h3>Four Hundred and Eighty-Two Tianjin Citizens Jointly Appeal to the British Ambassador</h3>
<p>Expressing Their Determination to Support the Government and Supreme Leader</p>
<p>Willing to Endure All Hardships to Support the Sacred War of Resistance</p>
<p>The British Ambassador Has Arrived in Ping from Tianjin</p>
<p>Hong Kong, Tianjin News. Four hundred and eighty-two Tianjin citizens, on the 4th, jointly sent a letter to British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr to welcome him and express their respect for his decision to come north. The letter also expressed the will of the people of North China and their hopes for Britain. The original letter reads: "Mr. Clark Kerr, we are citizens of Tianjin. We sincerely welcome and pay our respects to the British Ambassador, who has taken the trouble to travel far to Tianjin for inspection. Mr. Ambassador, you have taken the first step into North China, and we are very pleased because you can represent the British government and people in observing North China after Japan launched its war of aggression. Your understanding can be more accurate. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Japan has been trampling on our territory, killing our compatriots, destroying our construction, and expelling European and American businesses. You must have received many reports on all these facts from your country's consulates and garrisons. Recently, Japan has been clamoring to abolish the concessions, and has even implemented a blockade of the Tianjin concessions. A visit to the surrounding areas of the concessions will reveal the serious plight of hundreds of thousands of Chinese and foreign residents, and over a thousand of your country's troops within the British concession. Today, we will no longer provide you with any further information, but simply offer a few points to express the attitude of the people of North China and our hopes for you.</p>
<p>First, we support our government and our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. We are willing to endure all hardships to support the sacred War of Resistance until China drives out the enemy and achieves final victory. The people of North China will never surrender to Japan, nor will they recognize any puppet organizations fostered by Japan. In order to cover up their robber behavior and numb the hearts of the Chinese people, the Japanese warlords have hired a small number of traitors to serve as puppet officials. However, these traitors are all dregs that our government and people have long abandoned. Therefore, their actions can never represent the will of the Chinese people. You may know that in the first month of this year alone, the people of North China secretly remitted national donations through Tianjin to the interior, ultimately going to Chongqing. There have already been 120 batches. Since the start of the war, the people of North China have been remitting donations to our government every month. These donations are collected from the poor and the rich, residents, merchants, workers, students, women, and laborers of North China. We are only explaining the fact that we support the government, support Chairman Chiang, and support the War of Resistance. There are many more facts that can naturally illustrate our will, but this is just one of them. Regarding the recent 'peace movement' promoted by the Japanese side, we would like to make a statement. China has always been a peace-loving nation, and love of peace is our virtue. After the September 18th Incident, Japan occupied our four northeastern provinces, and then forced us to sign the Tanggu Truce, invading Chahar, northern Hebei and eastern Hebei, and creating the Hebei Incident. The Chinese government has repeatedly endured humiliation and swallowed its anger to the extent that it could tolerate. Now, the war has broken out, and it is Japan that has forced us to rise up and resist, and to fight for survival. Therefore, the people are willing to endure all the hardships and pain to support the government in fighting to the end, until victory. This proves that the recent so-called 'peace movement' has no popular support whatsoever and is entirely directed by puppet organizations instigated by Japan. Second, we would like to ask you to believe that in the past year and seven months, Japan has spent all its manpower, resources, and firepower, only to occupy nine cities and towns on the railways in North China. In other words, Japan does not have the ability to occupy the cities and villages outside the transportation lines. The majority of North China's territory, these villages and countryside, is still under the jurisdiction of our government. We have the strength to defend and have not fallen into enemy hands. Moreover, these areas have gradually expanded to the transportation lines. Until recently, in Beiping, there are already 10,000 fully armed soldiers of our army. On the border of Rehe and Chahar, there are 10,000 people. Between the Jinpu and Pinghan lines in Hebei Province, there are tens of thousands of people. In the Jin-Ji-Cha border area, there are tens of thousands of people. Throughout Ji Dong, Ji Nan, Lu Bei, and Lu Xi, there is not a single county that is completely occupied by the Japanese army. As for the entire Shanxi Province and northern Henan, there is no place that is not covered with our organized and heroic national army. Another fact further proves that Japan is unable to govern any occupied area. The "United Reserve Bank" counterfeit currency issued by the Japanese side is only used in a small number of cities on the railway lines. Ten miles outside the railway lines, the counterfeit currency becomes waste paper. All this also proves that the people of North China will never submit to Japan and the puppet organizations. Third, we hope that our friendly country, Britain, for the sake of justice, humanity, world peace, and British interests in the Far East, will give us more sympathy for China's War of Resistance. We believe that China's own national strength can defeat Japan alone. Our belief is the same as that of our officers and soldiers on the battlefield, and the people in the rear, and is no different from what you have seen in Chongqing and Kunming: Japan's stubborn invasion will inevitably fail, and China's just War of Resistance will ultimately be victorious. However, we know that if China fights Japan alone, the final victory will certainly belong to China, but the process will be extremely painful. If we have to wait until we completely defeat Japan with our own strength, Britain's commerce in the Far East will probably be completely destroyed by Japan first. Mr. Ambassador, you are a friend of China, and one of the British people most sympathetic to China. We dare to ask you, after this visit to North China, to more enthusiastically appeal to your country on behalf of China, and to use all the great sympathy that your country can give us. This is not only to help China, but also to safeguard your country's interests in the Far East. Finally, we feel ashamed that this is your first visit to Tianjin, but we cannot see our government agencies to give you a grand welcome. However, we believe that in two or three years at most, when you revisit Tianjin, you should be able to see the Chinese national flag with the blue sky and white sun everywhere, and receive a grand reception from our government. We wish you a healthy journey. Four hundred and eighty-two Tianjin citizens (signatures) (6th dispatch)"</p>
<p>(Beiping) Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, the British Ambassador to China, arrived here yesterday from Tianjin for a non-official visit. This is the first time Sir Archibald Clark Kerr has visited Beiping since his arrival in China. (6th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Anti-War Sentiment Rises in Japan</h3>
<p>Small Groups Established in the Invading Chinese Troops, Mutiny Once Occurred in Dagu</p>
<p>Tunxi: Recently, among Japanese officers and soldiers in the Jinghu area, anti-war sentiment has become increasingly strong. A few days ago, more than 500 Japanese soldiers in Jiangyin mutinied due to their anti-war sentiments, killing the Japanese commander and setting fire to the headquarters, causing great shock to the Japanese military headquarters. They considered transferring the Japanese garrison in Wuxi to encircle and suppress the mutiny. A sudden clash occurred, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. Currently, all the leaders of the anti-war officers and soldiers have been arrested and executed, and the remaining officers and soldiers have been ordered to disband completely. (6th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The situation of a mutiny by more than 3,000 Japanese soldiers in Dagu. On the 21st of last month, two Japanese warships transported more than 3,000 Japanese army soldiers from the front lines of Central and Southern China from Shanghai and arrived at Dagu Port. The next day, the troops suddenly mutinied. According to the investigation, the Japanese troops departed from Shanghai by ship. When they departed, the Japanese military commander gave a speech, saying that they were ordered by the "General Headquarters" to return home for rest and reorganization. The Japanese troops initially felt fortunate to have survived, but who knew that the Japanese warship they were on did not sail to Japan but arrived at Dagu Port. At this point, they began to suspect and sent representatives to question the captain of the ship about why they did not sail directly back to their country. The captain of the ship replied that he had received a secret order from "General Headquarters," stating that the guerrillas in Shanxi Province were active, and this part of the army had to be temporarily delayed in returning home and transferred to Shanxi Province for reinforcement. The Japanese soldiers were in uproar upon hearing this. Some said that the captain's words were not credible, and some said that the Japanese authorities had clearly deceived the soldiers. Despite the captain's repeated appeasement and telegraphing to Tokyo for instructions, they soon received a reply from "General Headquarters," still strongly ordering them to land at Dagu Port and proceed to Jin-Sui. On the 22nd, the Japanese captain, together with the Japanese army officer, announced the "General Headquarters" reply and gently exhorted the soldiers to obey the order of the "Grand Marshal." The Japanese soldiers all turned angry and clashed, opening fire. The order was in great chaos for a time. Previously, the Japanese captain had transferred four surveillance ships near the pier for vigilance. Hearing the sound, they were greatly alarmed and immediately opened fire to suppress the mutinous ships. It is not known that the Japanese army was stationed at the Dagu pier. Seeing the Japanese warship firing at the pier, they thought that the Japanese navy intended to provoke the army and also returned fire at the attacking Japanese warship. For a time, the sound of artillery rumbled, and the Chinese guerrillas thought that the Japanese army and the Chinese army were in fierce battle and sent many people to support them. At this point, a mixed battle occurred for a long time, and there were casualties on both sides. Afterwards, the Japanese military officer transferred the gendarmerie and another unit to Dagu Port to suppress the rebellion, and still forcibly ordered the mutinous troops to land and transported them to the front lines of Jin-Sui in two batches. This shows the intensity of the Japanese army's anti-war sentiment. (5th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Red Star Newspaper reported: "A crisis has now occurred in the Japanese army. The anti-war sentiment of its soldiers is generally high, and the combat effectiveness of the army has been weakened. Heavy losses have been suffered on the front line. This anti-war sentiment has become more and more obvious after the Japanese soldiers realized that the occupation of Guangzhou and Wuhan cannot determine the outcome of the war, and the so-called 'China Incident' has become a protracted war. Recently, leaflets urging them to surrender to the Chinese army have been found on the bodies of Japanese soldiers who died in battle and were captured. The Japanese Anti-War League has established small groups everywhere in the invading Chinese army. Although anti-war acts will be severely punished, soldiers are still happy to join these small groups and other anti-war organizations. Many desperate soldiers who have no way out commit suicide. The anti-war acts in the Japanese army are part of the increasingly high anti-war movement in Japan. Japanese soldiers, like all the people, realize that war only leads them to poverty and bankruptcy. In the past year, more than 300,000 people have been arrested in Japan for anti-war activities, which is enough to prove the size of this movement. The rear of the Japanese warlords has become increasingly shaken, Japan's national strength has become increasingly exhausted, and the Japanese army is in a dangerous situation, while China is becoming stronger and more united as it fights, and will resolutely counterattack the invaders."

<p>The United States Ships War Necessities to Japan</p>
<h3>The Financial Market Remains Stable, Various Industries Concluding Their Annual Accounts; Decisive Ability to Weather the Year Due to Abnormal Post-War Development; No Interest Paid on Deposits in Various Native Banks after the Thirteenth</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Native Bankers' Association resolved that February 18th would be the closing date for the 27th fiscal year; thereafter, various industries began to handle the final closing of accounts. The collection and settlement of funds by silver and native banks is gradually becoming busy. Because of the abnormal development of various industries in the Shanghai market after the war, there is no question about weathering the end of the year. The financial market remains as stable as ever. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Native Banks Begin to Handle the Final Closing of Accounts; Members of the Native Bankers' Association</p>
<p>43 native banks</p>
<p>have all been ordered to handle the final closing of accounts. Settlements have been handled separately with various client accounts, and interest on deposits will be calculated up to February 13th, and in accordance with the resolution of the Association, at the rate of 3.1%. No interest will be paid on deposits after the 13th, but overdue interest will continue to accrue. The market call money rate will be calculated up to the 17th. From today, various banks will extend their office hours according to the busyness of their business, and will take a four-day holiday starting from February 19th to organize everything, and will open for business on the 23rd.</p>
<p>Various Industries Prepare to Weather the End of the Year; Because the final closing date for the 27th fiscal year</p>
<p>is approaching in an instant,</p>
<p>various industries have separately begun to handle the final closing of accounts. They have separately sent personnel to collect outstanding accounts, so that they can be recovered in full before the final closing of accounts. The managers of various companies, firms, and factories have separately allocated funds in order to weather the end of the year safely. If goods are mortgaged to banks for cash to repay debts owed to various native banks, various native banks will suspend all new loans because the final closing of accounts is approaching. From yesterday, due to the final closing of accounts, the collection and settlement of funds by silver and native banks is gradually becoming busy.</p>
<h3>Remittances from Various Locations are Paid Out by the General Office</h3>
<p>Designated Counters for Payment; Recipients of Remittances Should Pay Attention</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, various industries and factories have moved to the interior, and the center of trade has also shifted from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Moreover, because various places have successively fallen into war zones, many people have taken refuge in Shanghai. However, remittances from various places to Shanghai have not decreased. However, the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittances Bureau stipulates that all remittances to Shanghai from various places must be presented to the General Office on North Suzhou Road with the ticket for collection, and no branch offices will make payments. However, because people from all walks of life are not familiar with the situation in the Bureau, even if they go to the post office, they are still clueless, which is inconvenient for both parties. The counters for payment of remittances from various places to Shanghai and the office hours are listed below: (A) Payment Counters, (1) No. 21 Zhejiang, Shaanxi, Hunan, (2) No. 13 Henan, Hebei (excluding Tianjin), Beiping area, Beiping General Branch (excluding), Hankou, Wuchang, and Hubei telegraphic transfers, (3) No. 24 Anhui, Jiangxi, Xinjiang, Hubei (excluding Hankou, Wuchang, and Hubei telegraphic transfers), (4) No. 15 Shandong, Shanxi, Gansu, Guizhou, Tianjin, Nanjing Branch, (5) No. 26 Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Yunnan, Nanjing, Badong, Dongchuan, (6) No. 28 Jiang Office (excluding Nanjing General Branch), Shanghai.

<h3>The Hua Army in Northern Jiangsu Has Completed Its Equipment; Will Besiege the Japanese Army Along the Coast; Japanese Warships Shelling, Japanese Aircraft Exerting Efforts to Reconnoiter</h3>
<p>The Hua Army guerrillas in four counties in northern Jiangsu, including Nantong, Haimen, Qidong, and Chongming, have been ordered by Gu Zhutong, commander of the Third War Zone of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, to be reorganized by Li Mingyang of the 24th Army Group. Sun Xinfu, the commander of the 5th Banner Brigade, has reorganized the original guerrilla leaders of the counties, including Ding Jutang, Yan Xiuwu, and Zhang Nengren, into a regular Hua Army, which is being trained day and night and has become a strong force. The troops in each county have been fully equipped, and ammunition has been replenished. The hundreds of Japanese troops entrenched in Qinglonggang and inside and outside the ×× three factories and along the coast of Nantong City have been heavily surrounded by the Hua Army. The battle has already taken place in Qinglonggang a few days ago. Because the Japanese army's reinforcements were insufficient, they retreated immediately. Japanese warships constantly shelled various villages along the coast, and three or four Japanese naval reconnaissance aircraft flew around the coastal ports every day to reconnoiter the location of the Hua Army, and the situation was quite tense. According to people from Haimen, the troops of Yan Xiuwu, commander of the 10th Regiment of the 5th Brigade of the 24th Army Group, have arrived at Daxin Port, only seven or eight miles away from Qinglonggang. Zhang Nengren is advancing towards ×× three factories in the Songji Port area, forming a siege. The battle is about to break out.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Arbitrarily Search Merchant Vessels; Business of Various Ships on the Yangtze River Sharply Reduced; Temporary Suspension of Procurement and Transportation of Merchant Loans in Various Industries in the Interior; Tourists are Sparse and the Market is Depressed in Various Towns Along the Coast</h3>
<p>Recently, several Japanese warships have been arbitrarily searching merchant vessels on the Yangtze River's downstream ports and shores, looting goods, and obstructing them in every possible way. After the business of various foreign merchant ships has been sharply reduced, the Japanese puppets have again greatly squeezed and increased taxes. Merchants have stopped procurement and transportation, and the market is extremely depressed in various towns along the coast. The various situations are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Searching Foreign Ships; The Japanese side, because the war in southern Guangdong is tight, has transferred the Japanese troops stationed in the interior to the front lines for reinforcements, so the troops are becoming increasingly thin. They are deeply afraid that the Chinese army will take the opportunity to attack, and they are implementing rear pacification work. From the 1st of this month, several Japanese warships have been dispatched to anchor in various ports in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River to conduct searches. All foreign merchant ships, regardless of nationality, are checked. In addition to questioning tourists about their origins, the goods loaded in the bottom of the cabin are also inspected one by one. Therefore, after various foreign ships have been obstructed by the Japanese army, the cargo and passengers have been reduced, and each shift is losing heavily.</p>
<p>Suspension of Procurement and Transportation; According to the Modern News Agency reporter's inquiry yesterday to various transportation companies stationed in Shanghai, since the Japanese puppets have implemented increased taxes, the "business tax" is 4% of the value, the "county affairs" tax is 2 to 4% of the value, and in addition, there is another 20% of the handling fee and 20% of the customs loss. Therefore, various industries and merchants, suffering from this illegal squeeze, are mostly unwilling to procure goods. Now, the branch companies in various ports in the interior have successively notified the Shanghai company to postpone the shipment of goods from Shanghai to the interior, and jointly negotiate with the Japanese puppet tax "agencies" to reduce the tax.</p>
<p>Depressed Ports; Yesterday, according to merchants from the interior who came to Shanghai, the markets of various ports along the Yangtze River, such as Hudu, Changyinsha, and Xingang, have been abnormally developed in the past. Merchants from all over the world gathered, and the value of goods entering and leaving each port every day was tens of millions of yuan. The Japanese puppet taxes were already considerable, but they were still not satisfied, and they even increased the exorbitant taxes. The burden on merchants' goods has increased, and the economy of the people in the interior has been exhausted after being searched by the Japanese, and the purchasing power is weak. The business of various industries is light, so the markets of various towns along the Yangtze River have been depressed recently, and are no longer as prosperous as before.</p>
<p>British Army Commander</p>
<p>Scheduled to Leave Shanghai</p>
<p>The English-language "Ta Mei Evening News" stated that Major General Smallett, commander of the British Army stationed in Shanghai, will officially leave Shanghai on the 11th of this month and end his command of the British Army in Shanghai. The military honor guards of various countries stationed in Shanghai and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will review Major General Smallett at the Luma Hall baseball exercise on that day, and then leave by car. Smallett's friends will also be present to see him off. Also, tomorrow (7th) morning at 10:45, Smallett will call on the chairman of the Public Works Department, Fan Keling, to bid farewell.</p>
<h3>China's Finances Have Laid the Foundation for Victory in the War of Resistance; China's Debt Per Person is Approximately Ten Yuan; Japan's Debt Per Person is Nearly Three Hundred Yuan</h3>
<p>According to a foreign economist, since the Lugouqiao Incident, China's full-scale War of Resistance has lasted for more than eighteen months, and its financial position has always been stable and consolidated. The economist highly praised the Chinese authorities' efforts to handle finances, adjust taxes, promote international trade, and stabilize the currency system since the War of Resistance, saying that the economic adjustments have laid the foundation for victory in the War of Resistance. The economist compared the current debts of China and Japan, with China's total debt being 600 billion yuan and Japan's total debt being 1.8 trillion yen. Based on these figures, China's debt per person is 13 yuan, and Japan's debt per person is 260 yen.</p>
<h3>The Leading Position of the Hardware Market Has Shifted from Shanghai to Hong Kong; Shanghai's Transportation with the Interior is Blocked; Copper for the Interior is Obtained from Hong Kong; The Resources Committee is Making Every Effort to Mine Copper Mines</h3>
<p>Shanghai has always been the concentration market for hardware trading in our country. Moreover, because most of the required copper is imported from foreign countries, domestic copper prices often rise and fall with Shanghai, and Shanghai depends on the London market. However, since the outbreak of the war, Shanghai's industrial foundation has been severely damaged, resulting in a sharp reduction in copper consumption. At the same time, Shanghai's transportation with the interior is blocked. The copper required for domestic industrial and military purposes will be mostly procured in Hong Kong. Shanghai has almost lost its leading position in the hardware market, and Shanghai's prices can no longer represent the trend of the copper market in our country. At the same time, because transportation to the interior is difficult and the import of foreign copper is inconvenient, the supply of copper is insufficient, and copper prices are not as stable as in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Copper Producing Areas in Various Provinces of the Country</p>
<p>Copper is the most</p>
<p>important</p>
<p>material in the</p>
<p>electrical industry,</p>
<p>and its application is extremely wide. Pure copper can be used to make electric wires for trams, telephones, and telegraphs, and other industrial machinery. An alloy of copper and zinc is called brass, which is used to manufacture screws, round rods, clock parts, and cartridge shells. The copper producing areas in the country are Hubei, Yunnan, Sichuan, and other provinces, with a total area of 4.76 million acres. Yunnan, Sichuan, and Guizhou produce 500 tons per year, with Yunnan producing the most copper. Sichuan and Guizhou produce less, and the remaining provinces such as Hubei, Gansu, and Shanxi produce less.</p>
<p>Jointly Forming the Dianbei</p>
<p>Mining Bureau</p>
<p>Dongchuan</p>
<p>Copper Mine is</p>
<p>currently our country's</p>
<p>largest copper</p>
<p>producing area.</p>
<p>The mining area is located in the northwest of Dongchuan County, divided into five major factories: Tangdan, Luoxue, Dashui, Maolu, and Tiezhang. The first four factories are all located in the northeast of the Jinsha River, while Tiezhang is located in the west of the Jinsha River, adjacent to Huali, Sichuan. The mine has always been government-run. Since its establishment, it has been more than 300 years. It is now managed by the Yunnan Provincial Government and named Dongchuan Mining Co., Ltd. Until September of last year, the Resources Committee and Yunnan Province jointly established the Dianbei Mining Bureau to handle the mining, smelting, transportation, and sales of copper mines and other mineral products in the northern part of the province, and used all the assets of Dongchuan as part of the government's investment.</p>
<p>Organizing Sichuan</p>
<p>Peng County Copper Mine</p>
<p>Sichuan Peng</p>
<p>County Copper</p>
<p>Mine is</p>
<p>the largest producer</p>
<p>in Sichuan,</p>
<p>and the second largest copper producing area in our country. The mining area is located in the northwest of Baishuihe Village. Since the Republic of China, it has still been government-run. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, it was changed to government supervision and commercial operation. In the twenty-second year, it was completely shut down due to financial difficulties and poor production. Now, the Resources Committee has sent personnel to organize and prepare for construction. According to the estimates of the Beiping Geological Survey Institute, the copper mine has reserves of more than 100,000 tons. The current organization method is to first unify the organization and rectify its internal affairs in terms of management. In terms of mining and smelting, light railways or aerial tramways are built between the mining area and the factory to solve the difficulty of transporting.</p>
<p>Taking Over Hubei</p>
<p>Daxin Xianfeng</p>
<p>Hubei's important</p>
<p>copper mines are</p>
<p>Daxin and</p>
<p>Xianfeng.</p>
<p>Daxin Copper Mine refers to the copper mines in Daye and Yangxin counties. The ore veins are widely distributed. Those in Daye are Longjia Mountain and Hongshankou, 40 miles southwest of the county, and those in Yangxin are Ouyang Mountain and Niushou Mountain, all 50 miles northwest of the county. After being closed down since the ninth year of the Republic of China, it is now state-owned, and the Resources Committee is trying to take over. Xianfeng Copper Mine starts from Yangti, which is adjacent to the border of Sichuan in the west, and ends at Dashanping in Xuansi County in the east, totaling 200 miles in length. It is currently being mined by locals using indigenous methods. A company has been organized, but unfortunately, it was terminated due to banditry.</p>
<h3>Lao Binsheng Silver Shop Responds to the One-Yuan Debt Repayment Movement</h3>
<p>The colleagues of Lao Baosheng Silver Shop at Taiping Bridge on Rier Road, considering the profound significance of the "One-Yuan Movement," specially raised 31 yuan in national currency and remitted it to Chongqing on the 6th to express their patriotic enthusiasm. The list of donations is as follows: Zhang Jingmao 10 yuan, Zhang Jinglan 4 yuan, Zhang Yuzhen 3 yuan, Mao Zuhua 2 yuan, Hu Yaoting 2 yuan, Chen Ziqing, Zhou Juquan, Hu Xialiang, Zhang Zhengao, Xu Binglin, Zhang Chenlian, Zhang Shicai, Zhang Shihua, Wang Ruilin, Chuan Rende, 1 yuan each.</p>
<h3>Direct Shanghai-Ningbo Passenger Shipping Implements Guarantee System; Strictly Prevent Strong Men from Leaving the Country and Spies from Infiltrating; Zhejiang Provincial Government Orders the Formation of a Japanese Goods Inspection Team</h3>
<p>Eastern Zhejiang's Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and other ports have already implemented defense,</p>
<p>Strictly restricting the entry and exit of ships; Ningbo, Jiao, Ou,</p>
<p>Various rivers and counties have formed Japanese goods inspection teams to strictly</p>
<p>Prevent Japanese goods from infiltrating. After direct Shanghai-Ningbo shipping is permitted,</p>
<p>Passengers are subject to a guarantee system, and measures are taken to prevent strong men</p>
<p>From fleeing. However, the inspection and prohibition affect local goods, and exports</p>
<p>Decline sharply. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Passenger Hall Provides Guarantees</p>
<p>Ningbo Garrison</p>
<p>Headquarters</p>
<p>Notifies all shipping</p>
<p>Companies that</p>
<p>Specially approved ships operating direct Shanghai-Ningbo routes may</p>
<p>Carry passengers, but passengers traveling from Shanghai to Ningbo</p>
<p>Must have a guarantee from a reputable merchant and attach</p>
<p>Two half-length photos of themselves. The Sino-Italian Company's De</p>
<p>Ping vessel is scheduled to sail from Shanghai to Ningbo on the 8th, initially implementing</p>
<p>A passenger guarantee system. Other vessels operating direct Shanghai-Ningbo routes</p>
<p>Include the American Company's Metta vessel, Jardine Matheson's Moufu vessel, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Tangsai vessel, Weir &amp; Han Company's Xin'an</p>
<p>Na vessel, and Butterfield &amp; Swire Company's New Beijing vessel,</p>
<p>Strictly Prevent Strong Men from Fleeing</p>
<p>Wenzhou, Taizhou, Ningbo, and other</p>
<p>Places strictly prevent</p>
<p>Strong men from leaving the country,</p>
<p>Therefore, for export</p>
<p>Passengers, those of draftable age must</p>
<p>Possess a certificate to be allowed to export; otherwise, they will</p>
<p>Be prohibited. It is also stipulated that ships operating Shanghai,</p>
<p>Taizhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, etc., are not allowed to dock at</p>
<p>Chumen, Shipu, Xiangshan, Dinghai, Ninghai.</p>
<p>Small ships operating Chumen, Dinghai, Shipu, Xiangshan, Ninghai</p>
<p>Are not allowed to sail to other ports, aiming to</p>
<p>Prevent strong men from leaving the country privately. Those traveling from Shanghai to</p>
<p>Zhejiang to purchase goods and collect customer accounts</p>
<p>Must obtain a certificate from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>Establish Japanese Goods Inspection Teams</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial</p>
<p>Government orders various</p>
<p>Counties to establish</p>
<p>Japanese goods inspection teams</p>
<p>To prevent Japanese goods from being disguised and dumped. They will be</p>
<p>Organized by each county government, county party headquarters, water police, anti-enemy</p>
<p>Association, police bureau, and county chamber of commerce, with each of these six institutions</p>
<p>And organizations assigning one to three people.</p>
<p>If it is discovered that Japanese goods are being used to impersonate domestic or foreign goods,</p>
<p>The goods will be confiscated, and the merchants who transport them</p>
<p>Will be severely punished. Currently, Dinghai, Haimen, Ning</p>
<p>Bo, Wenzhou, and other counties have successively established</p>
<p>Japanese goods inspection teams, formulating specific</p>
<p>Measures for punishing the seizure of Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Cargo Exports Sharply Decline</p>
<p>Since the Zhejiang Customs</p>
<p>Received orders to prohibit</p>
<p>Pomelos, timber,</p>
<p>Tea,</p>
<p>Cotton, native paper, fresh eggs, hemp, silk,</p>
<p>And 54 other items from being exported to Shanghai,</p>
<p>The local goods from the three places of Wenzhou, Taizhou, and Ningbo in eastern Zhejiang are</p>
<p>Piling up and unable to be transported to Shanghai for sale. Although various industries have sent telegrams to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>And the Ministry of Economic Affairs to provide accommodation and assistance,</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have not yet approved the transportation to Shanghai. Therefore,</p>
<p>Ships operating between Shanghai and eastern Zhejiang are affected by the prohibition, and</p>
<p>Cargo transportation has declined sharply. As a last resort, they have reduced</p>
<p>The number of ships operating.</p>
<p>Strictly Prohibit Smuggling by Sailing Vessels</p>
<p>The Ningbo Garrison</p>
<p>Headquarters</p>
<p>Believes that recently</p>
<p>Sailing vessels have often</p>
<p>Smuggled goods in and out, and strong men also</p>
<p>Use sailing vessels as a refuge to escape. Therefore, it has specifically</p>
<p>Ordered the coastal county governments under Ningbo's jurisdiction to thoroughly</p>
<p>Suppress and investigate and strictly order inspection teams to</p>
<p>Comply with the prescribed methods and earnestly handle matters.</p>

<p>A Year's Plan Starts in Spring</p>
<p>Making Lifelong Plans for Men Suffering from Kidney Deficiency</p>
<p>Spring has arrived! Spring has indeed stealthily come to the human world. Not only is this the sequence of the seasons, but it can also be seen in the smiles on people's faces, which have been warmed by the sunshine on skin shrunken by the cold. Ah! Spring has truly come! It is indeed cause for surprise! But with the arrival of spring, the year's plan starts in spring, and you should make some plans for your future and happiness at this time. Health is the foundation of our future and happiness. Our grand future must start from this foundation. If health is lost, what is left? This is truly the only important thing for us. But for a man in today's turbulent and erotic society, problems often arise with health. The most common and painful problem is that men discover problems such as kidney deficiency and sexual weakness after marriage. Let us imagine a girl marrying a husband. What is she marrying for? Sexual issues must be resolved through the marital path. This is the proper way. Who does not want to legitimately demand the happiness that life should offer? Therefore, a strong man who marries a girl with such aspirations will have deep love, and their married life will be intimate and sweet, enjoying the legitimate happiness of life. If a man has committed self-abuse and nocturnal emission in his youth or has been dissolute and unrestrained after marriage, the life-and-death glandular fluid that governs the health of the human body will inevitably be depleted, resulting in kidney deficiency and impotence, scattered energy, infertility after prolonged marriage, local atrophy, neurasthenia, etc., so that he often feels dizzy, lightheaded, forgetful, insomniac, has tinnitus and blurred vision, aching back, weak limbs, and feels exhausted after even the slightest effort! Although still young, he already presents a state of decline. Such a man, even if he sits all day and eats, is still dying. How can he compete with others? How can he achieve success in academia and career? Even in marital life, he cannot fulfill the duties that a husband should have, so he is often hated by his wife, creating family tragedies! He may even have no children, leaving a lifelong regret! What meaning does such a life have! Therefore, as the vernal equinox arrives, making a plan for the year is also making a plan for life. Methods must be sought to ensure that this disease is cured as soon as possible. According to world-renowned doctors and my personal experience, it is generally recognized that taking the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Substance" is the most effective and specific treatment. This medicine can generate semen and replenish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood circulation within one day and night after taking it, and the disease can be alleviated. With continued use, it is sure to cure the above-mentioned symptoms completely in a short period of time. However, those who have nocturnal emissions must also take "Hemetts' Semen-Strengthening Tablets" to consolidate the seminal vesicle and relieve the state of kidney deficiency and nerve hypersensitivity, so that nocturnal emission can be completely cured, and both the symptoms and the root cause can be treated, resulting in even more rapid results! The above-mentioned medicines have all been clinically verified by numerous Chinese and foreign doctors, proving their effectiveness is indeed certain and great, so they have long been popular around the world and are sold in all pharmacies. However, if patients can come to this clinic to be diagnosed by expert doctors and receive electrotherapy, injections, and other targeted therapies, a complete cure can be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Common Youth Diseases</p>
<h3>How Does Nocturnal Emission in Spring Affect You?</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>"If the grass is not uprooted, it will sprout again in spring." Although spring is a beautiful and warm season, people with chronic diseases often find that their old diseases recur or even worsen at this time.</p>
<p>Now, let's take nocturnal emission as an example. In winter, because the climate is cold, even if you have an important job at night, you still feel timid. Your feet refuse to stretch straight down, curling up like a hedgehog (sleeping curled up can also reduce nocturnal emissions). At this time, there are fewer dreams, and the chances of temptation are naturally fewer, so the number of emissions is also considerably reduced. But in spring, this is very different. Because spring is the time when all things sprout, it can also be said to be the time when things move from dormancy to stirring. At this time, the weather gradually warms up, there are more spring dreams, and there are also considerable physiological changes, so touching the scene produces emotions, and the youth are tempted at any time, further aggravating their nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>Since nocturnal emissions are frequent, the essence and blood produced physiologically are naturally not dedicated to metabolism, so dizziness, blurred vision, tinnitus, palpitations, aching back, weak memory, and inability to concentrate occur one after another. If one does not seek to remedy the situation urgently at this time, the condition will inevitably worsen, affecting the sexual nerves and causing local paralysis or hypersensitivity, or even complete impotence. Such a youth not only has no guarantee for his own health and studies, but also will not be able to fulfill his duties in future married life, resulting in all kinds of tragic incidents!</p>
<p>In short, the disadvantages of nocturnal emission are endless. Therefore, at the beginning of spring, those who suffer from this disease should quickly take remedial action. One way is to take "Hemetts' Semen-Strengthening Tablets" to consolidate the seminal vesicle and eliminate the hypersensitivity of the ejaculation center nerve. The other is to raise one's willpower, avoid bad contact, exercise diligently, rub the local area with cold water before going to bed, and pay attention to urination. If one can follow this, then no matter how many spring dreams there are, there will be no more emissions. If one has had various symptoms of weakness due to prolonged emission, then one can simultaneously use the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Substance" for tonification, which can generate semen and strengthen the kidneys, strengthen the brain and benefit the marrow within one day and night. If you continue to take it, you are guaranteed to regain your health in the shortest possible time.</p>
<p>Beauty and Health</p>
<h3>Passionate Woman (Must Have High Breast)</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Dr. Dimkarss, a great American expert in female physiology, said, "Passionate women must have high breasts." This initially caused many people to doubt. Later, he wrote an article "Breasts and Love" published in a famous magazine, explaining that the development of women's breasts is entirely based on the health of the ovaries, because the ovaries are the total hub for controlling female sexual function. When this sexual function is vigorous, it produces a large amount of internal secretions in the body. These internal secretions can promote the development of female characteristics, so in terms of body shape, the most obvious is that the breasts rise high. The nipples are sandalwood-colored, like the top of a cone-shaped mountain peak. Therefore, there are twin peaks in the chest, with a deep recess in the middle. How beautiful and intoxicating this is! In terms of emotions, it is also due to the stimulation of internal secretions that emotions are often rich and exhibit phenomena such as gentleness, warmth, happiness, sensitivity, and passion. Such a woman is the typical lover in the minds of men, a virtuous wife and loving mother in the family. …After this principle was explained, everyone began to believe that women's breasts not only have value in beauty and health but are also greatly related to inner emotions. Therefore, European and American women, in order to show their beauty, health, and passion, often pay attention to maintaining the development of their breasts. If there is anything unsatisfactory, they take the ovarian preparation "Female Germinal Substance" for tonification, so as to fully develop them. But when we look back at Chinese women, they not only do not pay attention to the development of their breasts but even use the method of breast binding to make them shriveled, which is really unreasonable and extremely foolish! As for those who have menstrual irregularities, leucorrhea, and other hidden diseases that damage the function of the ovaries, resulting in shriveled breasts, faded faces, and premature aging, these are even more common. Therefore, in the family, the feelings between husband and wife are inevitably weak, and they are like strangers, even though they are husband and wife! Even if they have children, this is just a flawed inheritance! Such a situation is not only extremely painful for them but also causes great harm to the country - the only remedy, according to world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, is to take the ovarian preparation "Female Germinal Substance," which is the most effective and specific treatment. This agent can tonify the ovarian function and promote metabolism within one day and night after taking it. If you continue to take it, you can completely cure the above-mentioned hidden diseases in a short period of time. It can also make the breasts rise high, the cheeks rosy, and increase beauty, health, and passion.</p>
<p>Cases in Venereal Disease Treatment</p>
<p>Compiled by Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>(I) Early Marriage Hurts, Fortunately Cured</p>
<p>Patient Hua Longquan, from Nantong, Jiangsu, is now 25 years old and works as an accountant in a financial institution. (Chief complaint) - After early marriage, excessive sexual activity led to incomplete development, kidney deficiency and brain weakness, coughing up blood (Medical history) - Hua was inherently weak. Furthermore, due to his parents' doting, he married at the age of sixteen. The couple's love was very deep, leading to excessive sexual activity, greatly hindering his development. After three or four years, he felt extremely weak, his body was declining, and his memory was greatly reduced, but he still did not know to be afraid. He did not abstain from lust in time, gradually developing kidney deficiency. He also coughed up blood, eventually becoming hopeless. In the early winter of last year, he was introduced by his colleague Bao to seek treatment from me. (Treatment method) - I believe that Hua's illness was due to indulgence before his development was mature, causing great damage to the reproductive glands and incomplete development. Symptoms such as physical weakness, anemia, and premature aging occurred one after another. Taking a large amount of "Germinal Substance" was not enough to reverse the decline. So, I instructed Hua to buy and take it from the pharmacy. Hua took it for two consecutive months, and all kinds of symptoms were swept away. The decadent youth was transformed into a healthy husband, and now he is radiant and vigorous, and his wife is pregnant with a child.</p>
<p>(II) Cure of Sexual Nerve Hypersensitivity</p>
<p>Patient Han Guoqing, from Ningbo, Zhejiang, is now 23 years old. He came to Shanghai in 1937 to do business. (Chief complaint) - He has been masturbating for many years. Although he knows the harm, he cannot quit due to excessive lust. Recently, his sexual nerves have become increasingly sensitive, causing him great pain. Nocturnal emissions, spermatorrhea, sexual fatigue, dizziness, and erotic dreams plague him. (Current symptoms) - Local development is incomplete, reflexes are hyperactive, the posterior urethra is congested, and he also has severe neurasthenia. (Treatment method) - I instructed him to quit his bad habits, perform vaginal irrigation, and then cool the posterior urethra. I gave him electrotherapy once a day and used "Hemetts' Semen-Strengthening Tablets" to consolidate his seminal vesicle. The hypersensitivity gradually disappeared. At the same time, I used the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal Substance" to eliminate his severe neurasthenia. The results were very good. After taking about three boxes each, he was completely cured.</p>
<h3>Our Newspaper Reporter Qian Hua was Assassinated and Died Yesterday; He Suddenly Encountered Thugs on Rue de la Course; He Died Before Reaching the Hospital for Treatment — Leaving Behind a Widow and Orphans, a Most Tragic Scene</h3>
<p>Qian Hua, a reporter for this newspaper, was assassinated at around 9:45 a.m. yesterday while passing through the intersection of Rue de la Course and Rue du Dragon. The details are as follows: Qian's courtesy name is Ruifu, and he is 38 years old. He is a native of Ningbo, Zhejiang, and a graduate of Yanjing University in Beijing. He worked for the Tianjin Yongbao newspaper. Afterwards he became a reporter for this newspaper. He also served as the main staff member of the Jingbao newspaper. He lived at No. 77, Mingde Lane, Rue Foch. Since the resumption of this newspaper last year, because of his foundation in English, he was assigned to the translation department. However, later he claimed illness and took leave of absence, which was approved by this newspaper, instructing him to rest. Yesterday morning at around 9:00 a.m., he was wearing a gray silk cotton robe, a Melton cloth overcoat, a felt hat, and glasses. He left his residence and hired a rickshaw (license number 5795) pulled by a man from Jiangbei named Zhang Jinshu, intending to go to the Jingbao newspaper office at the intersection of Shandong Road and Hankou Road. Unexpectedly, when the rickshaw reached the intersection of Rue du Dragon and Rue de la Course, a thin man about 30 years old, wearing a black long gown and a black felt hat, suddenly stopped his rickshaw and quickly pulled out a pistol, firing four shots at him. One bullet hit Qian's abdomen, and one hit his right hand. Seeing that things were not good, Qian jumped out of the rickshaw and ran forward. The shooter then fired several more shots, one bullet hitting the abdomen again and one hitting Qian's right temple. Wounded in vital areas, he fell to the ground. The murderer fled towards Rue de la Course, through the Western Temple (No. 63 Lane), and turned into Rue Yu Qiaqing to escape. By the time police officer No. 2383 from that area arrived, it was impossible to chase after him. He immediately reported to the Chengdu Road Police Station, which dispatched Western Detective Hui Gengsheng and Chinese Detective Shao JinFan to lead detectives to the scene of the incident to search and investigate. At the same time, an ambulance was summoned to rush Qian to the Renji Hospital for treatment. By this time, Qian could not speak. Soon his family also received the news and arrived. However, because the wounds were all in vital areas and he had lost too much blood, he could not be cured. He died at noon at around 12:00 p.m.. The body was sent from the hospital to the temporary autopsy office of the Shanghai Municipal Council on Jiaozhou Road at around 2:00 p.m., pending a report to the court prosecutor's office for inspection at 10:00 a.m. this morning. He is survived by his widow, Ms. Hu, who is 34 years old, and two sons and one daughter. The eldest daughter, Minyi, is currently 10 years old, and the eldest son, Dingxiong, is eight years old. Both are studying at Guangxia Primary School. The youngest son, Dingbang, is three years old and still in infancy. This unfortunate event is deeply grieved.</p>
<h3>The Portuguese Ship "San Threm" Was Searched by Japanese Warships; Lasted One and a Half Hours with Nothing Found; Took the Passenger and Cargo Manifests and Left the Ship</h3>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reported that the Portuguese-flagged small ship "San Threm" (transliteration) was sailing along the coast. Last Friday (the 3rd) at 1:00 p.m., it sailed from Haimen to Shanghai. Among the passengers were foreigners such as Blanc of the U.S. Consulate in Shanghai and Watson, the chief detective of the Central Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Council. After sailing out of Haimen for some distance, it encountered</p>
<p>A Japanese destroyer. When the Portuguese ship's crew saw the warship sending the signal "Stop or we will fire," the Portuguese ship immediately stopped. The Japanese warship then sent the signal "Sail close to this ship and drop anchor." Soon, a Japanese officer led some sailors to board the ship. Captain Aika wore his uniform, but the radio operator did not. The Japanese military thought Mr. Aika was the radio operator, so they confined him in the cabin, with an armed sailor guarding the cabin door, and inspected the ship's passenger and cargo manifests.</p>
<p>They also searched the entire ship for one and a half hours. Whatever the Japanese military was searching for, they apparently found nothing, because the Chinese authorities in Haimen did not allow anyone under the age of 40 to leave the country. According to the Japanese officer's words to the passengers of the Portuguese ship, the ship was lucky to be detained for one hour and 45 minutes. Recently, the warship detained a German ship for 28 hours. Afterwards, the Japanese officer took the cargo and passenger manifests and led the river soldiers away from the ship. The Portuguese ship continued to sail to Shanghai, encountering no further obstruction, and returned to Shanghai at 1:00 p.m. on Saturday (the 4th).</p>
<h3>The Central Gengkuan (Boxer Indemnity) Committee Assists Our Development of the Border Areas; Organizes Border Resources Survey Team; and Assists in Cultivating Technical Talents</h3>
<p>The Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Administration Commission has always spared no effort in supporting China's cultural undertakings. Recently, in view of China's active development of wartime economy, it has decided to allocate funds to organize a border economic resources survey team to assist the Chinese government in completing the border development plan and to do its best to assist in cultivating technical talents to meet the needs of construction work. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Organizing a Survey Team to Investigate Resources. The committee has decided to organize the following three major teams to investigate border resources: The first team will investigate the economic resources of Sichuan and Xikang. The second team will investigate the provinces in the Northwest (including Qinghai, Ningxia, Gansu, etc.). The third team will investigate the provinces in the Southwest (including Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangxi, etc.). It is now actively preparing for the establishment. The survey work of each team is tentatively scheduled for one year, with three months for preparation, six months for conducting on-site survey work, and another three months for completing the work.</p>
<p>Each Team is Divided into Five Working Groups. The committee has decided to establish five groups under the captain and vice-captain for the purpose of cooperation in public works. Each group will have one group leader and a number of members, all of whom will be experts. (1) The Geology Group will be responsible for the investigation of geology and geographical environment. (2) The Physics Group will be responsible for studying physical chemistry and engineering problems. (3) The Economics Group will be responsible for investigating the local economy, industry, commerce, and local political situation. (4) The Social Sciences Group will be responsible for investigating the local history, education, social situation, and archaeological research. (5) The Agriculture and Forestry Group will be responsible for investigating the local agriculture, forestry, biology, and animal husbandry. The annual working expenses of each team are set at 50,000 yuan. University students and staff are very enthusiastic about applying to join. It is said that the Sichuan-Xikang team will be able to start work in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Allocating Funds to Cultivate Technical Talents. In addition, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Administration Commission spares no effort in selecting and cultivating technical talents, either by assigning them to work or by providing them with continued training. Starting this year, it will allocate funds to subsidize 125 researchers in universities to engage in research institute laboratory work. Among them, 80 are planned to be selected from graduates of national and private universities. In the first year, a temporary monthly subsidy of 40 yuan will be provided. If the results are excellent within one year, a formal job will be assigned afterwards. Since the outbreak of the war, many universities in various places have been destroyed, and various research works have been interrupted. However, there are still more than 200 people continuing to study natural and social sciences with the support of Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Benevolent Association for Child Welfare Distributes Winter Clothing: Over 4,300 Pieces Have Been Distributed; Nantong Natives Form a Fundraising Team</h3>
<p>The Chinese Benevolent Association for Child Welfare has been distributing winter clothing to children in various Shanghai shelters since January 30th of this year. The winter clothing is transported by Red Cross vehicles, which has greatly facilitated the process. As of February 3rd, a total of 4,376 pieces have been distributed. The shelters that have received children's winter clothing include Jiangning, Weixing, the Fifth Yi Primary School, the Eleventh, Fifteenth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth, Thirty-third, Thirty-fourth, and Forty-third shelters.</p>
<p>New Asia Sponsorship: A letter from Xu Guanqun, head of the fundraising team approved by the citizens' fundraising committee, states that New Asia Chemical Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. has agreed to sponsor 50 refugees for one year, totaling 1,200 yuan in national currency, to be collected monthly by representatives of the association.</p>
<p>Nantong Natives: The Nantong Natives Association in Shanghai issues a notice to Nantong natives residing in Shanghai regarding fundraising for relief efforts, stating, "Those who have suffered the most from the devastating war are our fellow Nantong natives in Shanghai. Historically, the majority of Nantong residents in Shanghai have resided in Hongkou and Zhabei, and these areas have suffered the greatest losses in the recent conflict. Under the leadership of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, various charitable organizations in the city are currently sheltering many refugees. Most of our afflicted fellow Nantong natives, except for a few who have returned home, are now living in these refugee shelters. Consider this: should our afflicted fellow natives only rely on assistance from people from other regions, while we stand idly by? 'Helping those in distress can dispel calamities and accumulate blessings.' Whether this saying is true or superstitious, from the perspective of human mutual aid, we should, without hesitation, open our purses to help refugees suffering from hunger and cold, especially since our afflicted fellow Nantong natives are among the Shanghai refugee population. Therefore, our association has now organized a fundraising team, hoping that our fellow Nantong natives in Shanghai will enthusiastically donate according to their means, whether as a one-time donation or a monthly contribution. If you are willing to generously contribute, please send your donations to No. 24, Furun Lane, Guizhou Road (behind the Jincheng Cinema), to be forwarded by our association to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, to fulfill the responsibilities of us Nantong natives residing in Shanghai."</p>
<p>Native Place Associations: After promoting the organization of fundraising teams by various native place associations, the donations submitted by these associations have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the Pudong Native Place Association's entertainment and other donations total more than 5,150 yuan, the Hubei Native Place Association has donated 2,000 yuan, the Shaoxing Seven Counties Native Place Association donates 1,000 yuan per month, the Changzhou Native Place Association donates 1,200 yuan, team leader Xu Guanqun has personally donated 1,000 yuan, and employees of the Jiangyin Native Place Association donate 6 yuan per month, for a total of over 10,000 yuan in donations.</p>
<p>Donations to Refugees: Mr. Zhu Weichu, a philanthropist, recently celebrated his and his wife's fortieth birthdays and donated 100 yuan in national currency, saved from reducing the cost of the banquet, through Ge Futian to the citizens' group to be used for refugee relief funds. In addition, the citizens' group received additional donations yesterday, including 15 yuan from the Juxing Friendship Association's dinner savings and 180 yuan from the Shanghai branch of the Chinese Red Cross for sponsoring 15 refugees for six months by Lü Huan and others.</p>
<h3>Reports of Reorganization at Chang Fang Sheng Are Inaccurate; No Changes to Customs Administration; Employment of Japanese Customs Officers Still Under Negotiation; Reorganization of the Entire Administrative System Is Impossible</h3>
<p>Japanese sources have claimed that the Shanghai Jianghai Customs has been reorganized and that 70 Japanese customs officers have joined the service. All parties are paying serious attention to this rumor. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the Xiandai News Agency to the Jianghai Customs, the above claim is completely inaccurate. There have been absolutely no changes to the reorganization of the Jianghai Customs administration. Everything is being handled in accordance with the regulations promulgated by the National Government. The Japanese side is deliberately spreading this rumor, apparently to confuse the public. As for the employment of a large number of Japanese customs officers, although the Japanese side has made this request, Deputy Commissioner Luo Fude has no authority to accept it, so negotiations are still ongoing and no decision has been made. Although Shanghai's special environment often leads to unwarranted interference in the exercise of its powers, it would be extremely difficult to reorganize the entire administrative system of the Jianghai Customs without the permission of the situation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Postal Workers' Debt Repayment Movement: Over 2,000 Yuan Has Been Confirmed; Has Been Remitted to the National Government in Chongqing</h3>
<p>In response to the "One Yuan Debt Repayment Movement," all postal workers at the Shanghai Post Office previously agreed to contribute 2% of their salaries to the National Government to repay our national debt. This was unanimously approved by all postal workers, who signed up to donate. It has now been learned that the funds have been collected, totaling 2,538.60 yuan in national currency, and have been remitted to the National Government in Chongqing by the Central Bank. This action by the postal workers is commendable for its enthusiasm and can serve as a model for the labor community. It is hoped that all workers in the city will follow suit and achieve complete success.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Prohibits the Export of Local Goods, Causing Prices to Rise; Shanghai and Ningbo Industrial Circles Telegraph Requests for Opening</h3>
<p>Daily consumer goods in this city, such as local paper, charcoal, firewood, and domestically sold tea leaves, have traditionally relied on transportation from various ports in eastern Zhejiang for sale in Shanghai. Since the Zhejiang Customs was ordered to prohibit the export of 53 types of local products to Shanghai, the source of the above goods has been cut off, and market prices have also risen by 10-20%. In order to maintain the market, the Shanghai and Ningbo industrial and commercial circles have telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs, requesting that they quickly order the release. At the same time, it is reported that the Wenzhou industries' sales offices have also sent a similar request to the Ministry of Finance, as the Ouhai Customs has also been ordered to prohibit the export of local products.</p>
<h3>Customs Patrol Vessels Set Sail to Supply Lighthouse Keepers: Sailing to the Waters of Yushan and Dajishan to Transport Food and Fuel</h3>
<p>The patrol vessels "Liuxing" and "Haiguang" belonging to the Maritime Affairs Bureau of Jianghai Customs sailed to the waters of Yushan and Dajishan yesterday to transport food and coal to supply the lighthouse keepers. After completing their mission, they set sail back to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Shanghai to Establish a National Goods Review Subcommittee: Specializing in Review and Certification Matters</h3>
<p>The government has established a review committee to promote national goods, and this city will also establish a subcommittee. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese General Federation of Industry, and the Federation of Machine-Made National Goods Factories have jointly nominated more than 30 representatives and telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs for selection. It is reported that once the candidates have been selected, the subcommittee will be established to specifically handle the review of Shanghai's national goods and the issuance of certificates when they are exported to the mainland.</p>
<h3>Post Office Extends Time for Issuing and Receiving Postal Money Orders</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration, because it is the period for commercial account settlements, and the accounts of domestic and foreign industrial and commercial businesses are settled during this period, and because some counties and towns have fallen into war zones, and banks and money shops have either closed down or been destroyed by artillery fire, in order to facilitate the remittance of funds for the industrial and commercial sectors, has extended the time for issuing and receiving postal money orders from yesterday (usually until 4:00 PM, now extended to 6:00 PM, all offices implement this simultaneously).</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Local Bank Manages Zhejiang Province Matches: Implementing a Monopoly Can Increase Revenue by 2 Million Yuan Annually; Stipulating Prices to Strictly Prohibit Merchant Manipulation</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government is implementing a match monopoly, and in order to facilitate sales, it has entered into a contract with the Zhejiang Local Bank, which will be the sole manager, stipulating the prices of various goods, with each package affixed with a 5-cent monopoly stamp, which can increase revenue by 2 million yuan annually. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Local Bank Manages Public Sales: The Zhejiang Match Monopoly Office has not only sent personnel to be stationed in various match factories to handle special management matters, but also, in the locations of the Yongjia, Lishui, Yin County, Shaoxing, and other match companies, the monopoly is managed by the monopoly branch offices. In the remaining counties, a contract has been signed with the Zhejiang Local Bank, which will be the sole manager, establishing wholesale and retail outlets to sell at stipulated prices and suppress market prices. According to Huang Zupei, Director of the Zhejiang Department of Finance, the implementation of the monopoly can increase revenue by 2 million yuan annually.</p>
<p>Stipulating Prices and Strictly Prohibiting Manipulation: In order to strictly prohibit merchants from manipulating prices, the Monopoly Office has stipulated the following standard selling prices for the products of various factories: Yiwu Chang Company's "Fisherman" and "Zhongli" brands: 6 copper coins per box; Kuocang, Shenzhou, Yiben Wanli, Wudi, Liyang, Meiren, and other brands: 6.5 copper coins; Yandang Mountain: 7 copper coins; Guangming Company's Wenzhou, Lion Ball, Old Copper Coin, New Copper Coin, Congratulations, Shunfeng, and other brands: 6.5 copper coins; Cai Baizi, Wenzhou, Haojing, and other brands: 7 copper coins; Beautiful Wenzhou (enlarged): 7.5 copper coins; Zhengda Company's Republic of China (small box), Wudi, and other brands: 5 copper coins; Gun Cat: 6 copper coins; Zhejiang, Wudi, Flying Bear: 6.5 copper coins; Boy Scout, Picking Mulberry, Republic of China, New Picking Mulberry, Chang'e: 7 copper coins; Republic of China (enlarged): 7.5 copper coins; Bianmin Company's Shaoxing, Lion Cat, Bianmin: 7 copper coins; Leshen: 7.5 copper coins.</p>
<h3>The Cold and Shivering Prisoners in Various Prisons Deserve Pity: Please Donate Old Clothes and Quilts</h3>
<p>The prisoners in various prisons in this city are currently suffering and shivering due to the severe winter weather, which is pitiful. Yesterday, the wardens of various prisons urgently requested charitable organizations to donate old clothes and cotton quilts to prevent the prisoners from freezing to death and to promote generosity.</p>

<h3>At the Dance Hall: Student Steals Overcoat: Three Conspire to Steal, One Arrested: Pawn Ticket for 46 Yuan Discovered</h3>
<p>Ha Jiaxiang, a 19-year-old from Nanjing residing at No. 6, Pingjiang Lane, Lanweiai Road, French Concession, formerly a student at a certain middle school, went shopping at the Great New Company on the afternoon of the 4th of this month. At the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Qiaqing Road, he suddenly ran into his former classmate Wu Jiasheng. After greeting each other, Wu had a friend named Chen Aqi with him, whom Wu introduced to Ha as a student from a certain university. Since they were old classmates who had not seen each other for a long time, they went to Dadong Teahouse for refreshments. At that time, Wu had another friend named Weng Huaxiao (from Ningbo, 22 years old), who was already at the teahouse. Wu also introduced him. After eating, Wu and the others suggested going to the Cathay Dance Hall on Yu Qiaqing Road for tea and dancing, which was unanimously agreed upon. The four of them went to Cathay together, but Ha had other matters, so he placed his overcoat, worth 90 yuan, and a scarf, which he was wearing, on the sofa next to him instead of checking them in the cloakroom. Before long, Wu suddenly invited Ha out for a private conversation. Ha followed him out to the Great New Company across the street. Wu asked Ha for a loan, but Ha refused. Wu then falsely claimed that he needed to visit a friend at the Great New Dance Hall and told Ha to go back to Cathay first. Unexpectedly, when Ha entered the Cathay Dance Hall, his overcoat and scarf, as well as Chen and Weng, were gone.</p>
<p>Knowing He Had Been Conspired Against, He Urgently Reported to the New Gate Police: Not until 5 p.m. on the 5th did Ha Jiaxiang run into Weng Huaqing in front of the Great New Company. He grabbed him and handed him over to Detective Weng Peiyu, who took him to the police station. A pawn ticket for the overcoat was found on Weng. Weng admitted that he had pawned the overcoat at Xie Feng Pawnshop on Xiafei Road for 46 yuan. He and Wu and Chen had each received 15 yuan, and one yuan had already been spent. He was ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Special Court No. 1. Attorney Li Zhishan of the police station presented the case. After questioning by Judge Xiao, he was ordered to be detained pending further investigation in seven days.</p>
<h3>Bringing His Wife to Shanghai to Seek Refuge: Distant Cousin Gangs Up to Extort: Reported to the Police, Apprehended and Detained</h3>
<p>Zhang Guowen, from Fengxian, Pudong, recently brought his wife, Ms. Wu, to Shanghai to seek refuge and is temporarily staying at Room 129, Qinghe Inn, Qinghe Lane, Zhejiang Road. On the 3rd of this month, Xu Shanchu, a distant cousin of Zhang, suddenly came to Zhang's room and claimed that he was a guerrilla fighter who was now stranded in Shanghai and could not return home. Therefore, he asked for financial assistance of 200 yuan, saying, "Otherwise, something unfavorable will happen to you." Intimidated by this threat, Zhang immediately borrowed 50 yuan in silver dollars from the Qinghe Inn front desk and gave it to Xu. The next day, Xu's younger brother came to demand money again. Zhang could not pay, and he forcibly seized two gold rings (worth over 30 yuan) that Zhang and his wife were wearing on their hands. As soon as Xu's younger brother left, Xu came again and, with several thugs, surrounded Zhang and demanded a large sum of money. Zhang could not bear the harassment and escaped under the pretext of going out to raise money, hiding at a friend Mr. Lin's house. He did not dare to go home that night. On the 5th, he instructed Mr. Lin to go to the Qinghe Inn to check on the situation. Xu Shanchu and seven or eight others were still occupying Zhang's room. Lin returned to report to Zhang, and they went to the Old Gate Police Station together. Detective Sun Dafa rushed there, but the room No. 129 of Qinghe was already empty. After investigation, it was learned that Xu and others had taken Zhang's wife to Room 11, Lane 118, Zhejiang Road. He immediately went there and arrested Xu and his accomplices, Lu Maofu, Gu Ziming, Wang Bingming, You Genfu, Jin Agen, Yang Zhengxing, Ma Fugen, and a total of eight people. Yesterday, they were sent to Criminal Division 1 of the Special Court No. 1. Attorney Ru Baoyi of the police station said that the case was complicated and the police were conducting a detailed investigation. Therefore, he requested permission to temporarily detain the defendants in order to investigate the matter, etc. After questioning by Judge Xiao Xiefen, he ordered them to be detained and remanded for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Gang of Thieves Disagree on Division: Stabbed an Accomplice</h3>
<p>Several thieves were apprehended, and many weapons were seized.</p>
<p>On the night of the 31st of last month, at about 10 p.m., an incident occurred in Room 20 of the Haitongchun Inn on Yunnan Road, where a guest, Chang Dewu (aka Tang Dejiu), was stabbed with a knife. When the Old Gate Police Station heard the alarm, they ordered detectives to investigate. The assailant had already fled, leaving only the injured man to be transported to the Hager Road Refugee Hospital. Chang was very secretive about the reason for being stabbed.</p>

<h3>Tragic Truck Accident: Driver Was Negligent and Failed to Brake in Time: The Fang Sisters Died Together</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 4th of this month, at about 5 p.m., a tragic accident occurred at the intersection of Fuxu Road and Seymour Road, where a military truck crashed, resulting in fatalities. It was the most unfortunate of all traffic accidents. The brief details were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Now, according to the results of the investigation, the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Fang's Brief Biography: The deceased Fang sisters were pioneers in the women's circles of Jiaxing. Fang Ying, whose given name was Jingzhao, was over 60 years old and had been the principal of Jiaxing Fanlihu County Girls' Middle School for more than 20 years, achieving considerable accomplishments. After the outbreak of the war, school affairs were suspended. Fang transited from eastern Zhejiang to Shanghai, where she pawned a house on Gondon Road, Aiwuyi Road. Those living with her were her aunt and her brother's wife (her husband, Mr. Gu, had died early). Fang Yinchuan was her younger sister, over 50 years old, and was the wife of Jiang Zhixin, the director of Jiaxing Dexin Hospital. She was skilled in obstetrics and surgery and assisted her husband in managing the hospital affairs, also known for her abilities. The hospital now has a branch clinic inside the Ying Primary School at the east end of Yapei Road, Fuxu Road, and a separate residence in Kangle Village.</p>
<p>Going Out to Visit Friends: On the afternoon of the 4th, the Fang sisters went to Yuyuan Road to visit friends. At about 5 o'clock, they took a bus on Route 9 to return. At that time, the traffic was heavy and continuous, and it was very difficult to cross the road. The Fang sisters walked side by side, and for the sake of caution, they detoured to the corner of Seymour Road in order to cross over. The advertising sign for the Dexin Hospital branch clinic was already in sight.</p>
<p>The Driver Was Careless: At this moment, a cargo truck (permit number 1617) sped from the west and suddenly made a sharp turn to the left. Pedestrians in the middle of Seymour Road were caught off guard, and the Fang sisters were the first to be hit, knocked down by the giant wheels, injuring their ribs and dying on the spot. According to eyewitnesses at the time, two other people were thrown several feet away, but they did not suffer fatal injuries. The disaster can be described as tragic.</p>
<p>After the Accident: The driver of the truck that caused the accident was immediately taken to the police station for questioning. The deceased were taken to Guangren Hospital, but there was no way to revive them. The accident scene was only a few dozen steps away from the Dexin Hospital branch clinic. A staff member informed the director of the news of the death of two pedestrians. The director initially did not investigate further until dinner time, when he wondered why his wife had not returned. He thought that she was having dinner at her friend's house, so he was relieved and returned to his private residence in Kangle Village to rest. It was not until after 8 o'clock that he received the terrible news. The whole family was shocked. After the incident, the police made great efforts to investigate the family of the deceased, searching the friend's contact address in the notebook found on the deceased, and finally reached their destination. However, three hours had already passed.</p>
<p>Funeral Arrangements: After the families of the deceased heard the news, the bodies had been transferred to the Feilun Road morgue for examination. It was a Sunday, so there was no office. It was not until 9 a.m. yesterday that the examination was completed. Funeral arrangements were made at the Central and Dazhong Funeral Homes. There are not a few natives of Jiaxing in Shanghai, and they are initiating a meeting to mourn and pay respects in the coming days.</p>
<h3>Extremely Cold Weather</h3>
<p>Today's Weather May Turn Slightly Warmer</p>
<p>The weather in this city this winter has been very mild, like spring, unlike the severe winter. It wasn't until the 5th (the Beginning of Spring Festival) that it suddenly turned cold. Yesterday's weather was even colder, with the lowest temperature dropping to 24.8 degrees (below freezing), the first severe cold this year. Residents reported that they were shivering. It is said that the astronomical observatory has learned that the dramatic changes in the weather in recent days are due to the changes caused by the meeting of low and high pressure. Therefore, wind and snowflakes are caused by this kind of action. However, now the low pressure has been driven back by the high pressure, so the weather is returning to normal, and it may be slightly warmer today.</p>

<h3>Collecting Scrap Metal to Sell to the Japanese and Sending Threatening Letters to Extort Money</h3>
<p>Three Defendants Confess to Using the Proceeds for Military Expenses; Debate Concludes, Sentencing on the 13th</p>
<p>Huang Peng, resident at No. 9, Henry Apartments, Henry Road, French Concession,</p>
<p>formerly operated an iron factory in the Nanshi area.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the war, he collected scrap metal and sold it</p>
<p>to the Japanese for profit. In early October of last year,</p>
<p>Zhu Zhongsheng, a native of Chuansha, claiming to be the commander of a guerrilla</p>
<p>force, residing at No. 312, Route Lartigue, learned of this.</p>
<p>He sent a letter to Huang Peng threatening extortion. As a result of negotiations between the two parties at the</p>
<p>Weida Hotel on Rue Foch, Huang Peng paid</p>
<p>6,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in government bonds,</p>
<p>to settle the matter. Subsequently, Zhu sent another letter to Huang Jisheng at No. 358, Route du Consulat, demanding money,</p>
<p>enclosing three bullets in the letter. He was soon discovered by the French</p>
<p>police. Zhu set up a blackmail and extortion</p>
<p>operation at the Dalai Hotel at</p>
<p>No. 15, Gansdong Road.</p>
<p>Therefore, detectives arrested Zhu Zhongsheng and his accomplices,</p>
<p>Bao Chongzhen, Zhou Junmei, Zhang Yaozhong, Zhang Guojun,</p>
<p>Zhang Amao, and Zhang Fengxiang, seven people in total, one after another on the afternoon of December 30 last year,</p>
<p>and seized a pistol,</p>
<p>two hand grenades, and a large leather suitcase containing threatening letters, drafts, envelopes, symbols, and other items from the Dalai Hotel. They were escorted to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention.</p>
<p>Repeated requests were made to extend the investigation.</p>
<p>The details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. This case is now being handled by the Police Department.</p>
<p>The investigation has concluded. Yesterday morning,</p>
<p>Judge Zhang Minsheng of the Second Special Court</p>
<p>presided over the trial in the First Criminal Court. Yuan Jiahong, a lawyer from the French Concession administration, explained the case</p>
<p>and the investigation process, prosecuting Zhu Zhongsheng, Zhou Junmei, Zhang Yaozhong, and Zhang Guojun</p>
<p>for the crime under Article 346 of the Criminal Code. He also stated that there was</p>
<p>no connection with Bao Chongzhen, Zhang Amao, and Zhang Fengxiang, and they would not be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Huang Peng then recounted the extortion he suffered. When questioned, Zhu Zhongsheng confessed that, upon receiving a report that</p>
<p>Huang Peng was providing</p>
<p>scrap metal to the enemy to make a profit,</p>
<p>he sent three letters.</p>
<p>In the current environment, sending letters was nothing more than a warning to him. Huang voluntarily negotiated with him and gave him</p>
<p>the money, agreeing on 6,000 yuan. On October 5th, he first received cash and 1,000 yuan in government bonds at the Weida Hotel.</p>
<p>On the 7th of the same month, he received 540 yuan at Room 315 of the Great China Hotel.</p>
<p>Of this amount, 1,700 yuan was allocated to Pei Dong for military expenses, and the remaining funds were used by various branch offices in Shanghai. Apart from receiving money from Huang Peng's office at No. 531, Zhonghui Building, he also contacted</p>
<p>Huang Jisheng at No. 385, Fulili Road, Yuyuanxiang Foreign Goods Store on Gansdong Road, and Fuchang Wood Firm at No. 35, Jules Plass Road, but did not receive any money. Zhou Junmei admitted to writing the letters, and Zhang Yaozhong admitted</p>
<p>to sending the letters</p>
<p>on the orders of the commander. Zhang Guojun confessed to obtaining over 190 yuan, 100 yuan of which was used for travel expenses to Taicang, and over 90 yuan was distributed among the families of comrades.</p>
<p>At this point in the interrogation, the court, considering the case to be clear, ordered the opening of the debate. After mutual arguments between the lawyer of the French Concession administration and the defense lawyers of the defendants, the court announced the conclusion of the trial and set the sentencing for the 13th. The defendants were remanded into custody.</p>
<p>Robbery Case on Rue du Marché</p>
<p>Police Continue Investigation</p>
<p>At 6:50 AM on the 4th of this month,</p>
<p>a struggle between Chinese and Western police and robbers occurred on Rue du Marché, near the intersection of Rue Montauban, French Concession.</p>
<p>As a result, the robber Wang Fuyun, also known as Zhang Agen, was killed.</p>
<p>A fellow robber, Fan Xiaomao, was arrested by detectives at the entrance of Lane 23, Route des Pères, and taken back to the police station for investigation. The robber's body was sent to the morgue of the Tou-Se-We Orphanage for examination. The details have been reported in detail.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the French police reported the case to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic doctor went to the scene to examine the body and then sat in court.</p>
<p>First, detectives reported the situation of the investigation after the incident.</p>
<p>Then, the victim, Hou Arong (a tea boy at Wing On Company), testified that the deceased, his escaped accomplices, and the arrested Fan Xiaomao, impersonated detectives</p>
<p>and came to search for morphine as a pretext for robbery.</p>
<p>The robber Fan Xiaomao was sent to court by the police.</p>
<p>According to his confession, Zhang Ada, who is still at large, instigated him, along with the deceased Zhang Agen, and Wang Er and</p>
<p>Wang San, who are also at large, to commit the robbery.</p>
<p>Previously, they had robbed a coat and a gold ring in Xinxinli, Dapu Bridge.</p>
<p>No family members of the deceased have come forward. The official autopsy confirmed that Wang Fuyun,</p>
<p>also known as Zhang Agen, died from gunshot wounds. The body was handed over to the mortuary for burial. The remaining criminals were handed over to the police department for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>At 3 PM, the police sent Fan Xiaomao to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court.</p>
<p>Yuan Jiahong, a lawyer from the French Concession administration, stated that the Police Department's investigation of the defendant's robbery case was not yet concluded and requested a postponement of the interrogation. After Judge Zhang Minsheng verified and questioned the defendant, he ruled that the case would be re-examined on the 15th, and the defendant was remanded into custody.</p>
<p>Demanding Protection Money Leads to Murder Case</p>
<p>The Murderer Sentenced to Five Years</p>
<p>The Civil Portion of the Case Transferred to the Civil Court</p>
<p>The rogue Xu Bingsheng, (nicknamed "Blind Afu,"</p>
<p>previously convicted of selling morphine and sentenced to one year and four months by the First Special Court after being arrested by the Municipal Police),</p>
<p>engaged in drug trafficking in the middle room of No. 66, Ruifuli, Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, after being released upon completion of his sentence.</p>
<p>At 8 PM on December 27 last year, the hooligan Chen Along</p>
<p>and four or five of his accomplices came to Xu to demand protection money.</p>
<p>When Xu refused, they argued and quarreled. Xu blew out the candle</p>
<p>and stabbed Chen in a vital spot in the dark, killing him on the spot.</p>
<p>Xu and Chen's accomplices fled in a panic. Later, the police arrested Xu</p>
<p>and sent him to the Second Special Court for prosecution on the charge of murder.</p>
<p>The deceased's mother, Li Zhang, also filed an incidental civil lawsuit. After Judge Zhang Minsheng held several hearings and</p>
<p>appointed lawyer Wang Shizong to defend Xu, he declared the</p>
<p>trial concluded and set a date for sentencing. The details have been reported in the newspapers.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang presided over the sentencing in the First Criminal Court.</p>
<p>Xu Bingsheng was sentenced to five years in prison for murder.</p>
<p>The incidental civil lawsuit was transferred to the Civil Court. During the appeal period,</p>
<p>the defendant was held in custody.</p>
<p>Shameless Men and Women</p>
<p>Peddling Obscene Photos</p>
<p>Large-Scale Manufacturing Operation Uncovered; Machines, Pornographic Films, Negatives, etc., Seized</p>
<p>Wang Jinfeng (20 years old, from Suzhou, resident at No. 242, Caishi Street), Xu Yunfeng (40 years old,</p>
<p>resident at No. 3, Lane 19, Route des Soeurs), Ma Shuangsheng (56 years old), and others,</p>
<p>were found in possession of a</p>
<p>large number of obscene</p>
<p>photos near Shansi Road on Fuzhou Road at around 8 PM on January</p>
<p>31. They were arrested by Chinese detective Qian Xianning of the Central Police Department</p>
<p>and sent to the First Special Court for prosecution on charges of undermining public morals. They had been interrogated once, and the case was scheduled for a later date.</p>
<p>During the postponement, based on the defendants' confessions, the police,</p>
<p>together with personnel from the French Police Department, uncovered a</p>
<p>huge filming and manufacturing operation at No. 89, Lane 276, Caishi Road on the morning of the 4th of this month.</p>
<p>Two manufacturing machines, over one hundred types of romantic and shameless pornographic photos of men and women of a certain nationality, and dozens of boxes of inferior negatives were seized.</p>
<p>A female suspect, Xu Li (43 years old, from Suzhou), and her son,</p>
<p>Xu Guoliang, were arrested. The main suspect, Xu Damao (Xu Li's husband), is at large.</p>
<p>They were sent to the First Special Court yesterday morning</p>
<p>for prosecution according to the law. A request was made to postpone the case and merge it with the case of Gongjinshu and others for trial.</p>
<p>After hearing the case, the court briefly questioned the defendants and then ruled that the case would be postponed until the morning of the 8th for further examination.</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Tired of War</h3>
<p>Anti-War Slogans Posted Everywhere Inside the Jiangnan Shipyard</p>
<p>The Jiangnan Shipyard in Gaochangmiao, Nanshi,</p>
<p>which was occupied by the Japanese Qing Company, is now converted to a Japanese naval</p>
<p>shipyard. It has recruited seven or eight hundred workers, and all</p>
<p>the foremen, over a hundred people, are Japanese.</p>
<p>All of these hundred or so people were conscripted into military service in their home country.</p>
<p>Because they were unwilling to fight on the front lines, they maneuvered to obtain this military factory job.</p>
<p>However, sometimes because they have been stationed idly for six months, or because of misconduct, they still have to be transferred out,</p>
<p>which causes them great distress. Unexpectedly, recently,</p>
<p>anti-war and anti-warlord slogans and leaflets have been posted throughout the factory,</p>
<p>more than in any other factory. After their superiors came to the factory for inspection and discovered this situation,</p>
<p>they launched a major "ideological review." Therefore,</p>
<p>most of the Japanese soldiers and workers in the factory were transferred to the front lines.</p>
<h3>Thirteen Truckloads of Japanese Soldiers' Ashes Shipped Back Home</h3>
<p>The Heavy Losses of the Japanese Army Can Be Seen From This</p>
<p>According to a source from Hongkou yesterday, thirteen truckloads of Japanese</p>
<p>soldiers' ashes were witnessed being loaded onto ships and transported back to Japan.</p>
<p>The ashes of the Japanese soldiers were placed in iron cans,</p>
<p>with their names, ages, and dates of death written on the outside.</p>
<p>It is unknown where they came from. Each</p>
<p>truck had a large wreath hung in front of it.</p>
<p>This shows the large number of Japanese soldiers who have died.</p>
<h3>The Puppet "City Government" Suffers Financial Panic and is on the Brink of Collapse</h3>
<p>Since this month, the puppet "City Government"</p>
<p>has been forced by the puppet "Renovation Government" to abolish various puppet "consumption</p>
<p>taxes," which has caused a major financial panic for February.</p>
<p>During the puppet "Office" era, the monthly expenses for both the upper and lower levels were 280,000.</p>
<p>After the reorganization into the puppet "City Government,"</p>
<p>Chuan Xiaoyan eagerly sought to expand his power, increasing the expenses to 480,000. This year, it has increased to 600,000.</p>
<p>The reason for the rapid increase is due to the increasingly rampant corruption</p>
<p>within the puppet "Government."</p>
<p>Although the puppet "Renovation Government" reluctantly abolished the puppet "taxes" in various places,</p>
<p>it promised to subsidize the puppet "Government" with 400,000 yuan per month. However, this verbal assurance</p>
<p>will become a mere illusion, as the "Renovation Government" itself</p>
<p>is already struggling to take care of its own affairs. Hearing this disappointing news,</p>
<p>it is still planning to levy a puppet "land tax" and a puppet "business</p>
<p>tax" to make up for the shortfall. However, after threatening for three months to enforce</p>
<p>the "land reporting," no one paid attention. The puppet "business</p>
<p>tax" is also uncertain, as most of the businesses in the suburbs have not resumed operations.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no prospect of being able to fund the puppet government in February (</p>
<p>most of which is puppet staff salaries).</p>
<p>In the past, there were disputes over the order in which the puppet "Government"</p>
<p>paid salaries. The puppet Finance Bureau was the first to pay, on the 24th of each month.</p>
<p>The puppet "City Government" paid on the 25th,</p>
<p>the puppet Public Utilities Bureau on the 26th, and other puppet "Police Bureaus"</p>
<p>on the 28th. However, the affiliated puppet "organizations," such as the</p>
<p>"Police Brigade," would not be paid until the second or third day of the following month.</p>
<p>This was unfair, and the puppet staff generally complained.</p>
<p>This almost caused internal conflict. Now that there is no prospect of paying any salaries for this month,</p>
<p>both the big and small puppets are extremely anxious.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Executes Spy</h3>
<p>Gu Zhenghua, a local man aged 29,</p>
<p>worked as a clerk in the Xinhua Transportation Company organized under the protection of the Japanese. He specialized in patrolling</p>
<p>goods in the area of West Hongqiao Road, Great West Road, and Zhongshan Road.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of his position, Gu shamelessly</p>
<p>acted as a spy for the Japanese army. His agency was located in</p>
<p>Room 1 of a certain hotel on Avenue Edward VII.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, Gu was instructed by the Japanese to go to the countryside to inquire about the whereabouts of the guerrillas.</p>
<p>When he reached the Hongqiao Road and</p>
<p>Bintingtou areas in West Shanghai, he encountered a guerrilla patrol</p>
<p>passing by. They noticed that Gu's behavior was suspicious and went forward to question him.</p>
<p>Gu was evasive. After repeated interrogation,</p>
<p>he revealed the truth and a secret address</p>
<p>and a transportation pass issued by the Japanese</p>
<p>company were found on his person. The soldiers of the team were furious after hearing his confession.</p>
<p>They executed the criminal Gu Zhenghua on the spot.</p>
<h3>Shenxin No. 6 Factory Suffers an Accident</h3>
<p>The storeroom of the Shenxin No. 6 Factory at No. 22, West Lake Road, Yangshupu, East Shanghai,</p>
<p>suddenly caught fire at 6:30 PM yesterday. Thick smoke spread immediately,</p>
<p>and the fire was very fierce. Subsequently, the fire brigade arrived on the scene</p>
<p>and tried their best to put out the fire. The fire was extinguished after an hour.</p>
<p>As a result, a corner of the storeroom and dozens of bales of cotton</p>
<p>were burned, but the loss was slight.</p>
<h3>Young Man Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>Pan Jiaxing, 25 years old, lived at No. 8, Kangjia Village, Connaught Road, West Shanghai.</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Pan, due to economic pressure,</p>
<p>suddenly became despondent and swallowed poisonous liquid</p>
<p>behind people's backs to commit suicide. Later, he was discovered</p>
<p>and immediately taken by car to the Red Cross Hospital on Route Haig for treatment.</p>
<p>He had taken a large amount of poison, and his life was in extreme danger.</p>

<p>the epidemic prevention vehicle team is conducting</p>
<p>widespread vaccinations in various shelters,</p>
<p>schools, shops, factories, and shantytowns, disinfecting houses, bedding, and clothing.</p>

<h3>Effective Medicine for Frostbite</h3>
<p>Swelling Disappears on the Day It Hasn't Broken</p>
<p>Recovery in Days for Ones That Have Already Festered</p>
<p>Frostbite is caused by the stagnation of blood. It starts with redness and</p>
<p>intense pain. After it ulcerates, the pus drips, and the pain is even more severe.</p>
<p>This disease is particularly common in winter, and there is a lack of effective remedies. Patients suffer greatly.</p>
<p>This year, the Zhenwei Pharmacy (corner of Yinhua Street, Second Malu) has invented two effective medicines:</p>
<p>(1) Frostbite Ruyi Water is specially for treating unbroken frostbite.</p>
<p>Once used, the pain and itching stop immediately, and the redness and swelling disappear.</p>
<p>(2) Pearl White Jade Cream is specially for treating festered frostbite. Once used, it removes decay and promotes new growth,</p>
<p>leading to recovery in a matter of days. The price is 0.25 yuan per bottle for Ruyi Water and 0.4 yuan per box for White Jade Cream. Telephone: 92525. No delivery is provided.</p>

<p>the quality is excellent, and the effectiveness is great. Furthermore, it is purchased in bulk, and the</p>
<p>cost is relatively low. Now that new stock has arrived and it is the season for tonics,</p>
<p>Zhenwei Pharmacy is lowering prices to the lowest possible level. A carton of high-quality</p>

<h3>Finance - Buying Activity Intensifies - US Dollar Breaks Through 16 Yuan Mark - Tientsin and Peking Exchange Banks Actively Accumulating - Japanese Merchants Also Secretly Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw banks acting on behalf of foreign exchange banks in Tientsin and Peking continuing their relentless accumulation, with Japanese banks also secretly active in acquiring currency. Additionally, Sassoon and other major foreign firms were also aggressively buying, so even with Hong Kong Electric and HSBC supplying to maintain the market, the overall position was still short. The underlying trend became increasingly tight. Sterling was at its tightest, quoted at 8 1/8 pence at 15.625. The US dollar also broke through the 16 yuan mark, with the softest quote at 15.90625 yuan. The Hong Kong dollar weakened further due to strong buying interest from banks. Trading volume was extremely high throughout the day.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large denominations continued to rise, New York silver prices remained flat, London spot gold contracted by half a penny, and exchange rates between Sterling and the US dollar, the French franc, and the Shanghai dollar remained unchanged. The US dollar rose by 0.0625 against the Sterling and 0.025 against the French franc, remaining flat against the Shanghai dollar. The official rates of the Central Bank remained unchanged. Banks opened early with spot selling prices: Sterling at 8 1/8 pence and 25, the US dollar at 16.09375 yuan, Sterling being flat and the US dollar being up 0.03125 yuan compared to last Saturday afternoon closing. After the opening, favorable US banks like McCallie and others raced to aggressively acquire currency, and the premium between Hong Kong Electric, Sterling and gold narrowed from 8 1/8 pence at 21875 to 203125, and the US dollar tightened from 16.0625 to 16.0 yuan. So the situation was quite weak. HSBC's announced rates were unchanged, and the silver balancing tax was announced at 0.025, calculated as 5.25%. Afterwards, Western and US banks also came in to compete for settlement, and the banks' willingness to supply was weak, further tightening the underlying trend. Sassoon aggressively bought, with favorable banks Huabi and Sterling at 8 1/8 pence at 203125, then settled with American banks, Indosuez, Huabi, and Holland for the US dollar at 16.0 yuan. Near noon, the US dollar broke through the 16 yuan mark, tightening to 15.96875 yuan. The Hong Kong dollar also tightened because of strong buying appetite from foreign exchange banks. Huayi and Holland bought Hong Kong dollars from money changers at 54.875 yuan.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, favorable banks and foreign firms competed to aggressively acquire currency. HSBC's Sterling was only 8 1/8 pence at 1875, and the US dollar was 15.9375 yuan. Sterling was at its tightest, quoted at 8 1/8 pence at 15.625. The US dollar was also quoted at 15.9025 at its tightest. Afterwards, Indosuez bought Hong Kong dollars from money changers at 54.875 and 75, making the market price more expensive. Extended to late closing, banks' selling prices were: Sterling at 8 1/8 pence at 171875, US dollar at 15.90625 yuan. As a result, compared to last Saturday afternoon closing, Sterling contracted by 0.078125, and the US dollar tightened by 156.</p>
<h3>Tientsin and Hong Kong Syndicates Compete to Purchase - Cash Prices Rise Again - Highest Reaching 2057 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold black market prices rose again. Easing European tensions led to tight conditions in the foreign exchange black market. With renewed confidence in the market, Tientsin and Hong Kong syndicates secretly instructed certain money changers to actively buy, and local wealthy individuals and securities firms followed suit, pushing prices higher. Although cash dealers, silver shops, and money changers sold, the imbalance between supply and demand remained significant. Prices once reached a peak of 2057 yuan, an increase of 9 yuan. There were several fluctuations along the way, but no major disturbances. Trading activity was high. Silver jewelry prices also increased by one yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold prices decreased.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Up 9 Yuan</p>
<p>The opening selling price for each bar (10 taels) was 2040 yuan, but no transactions were seen. At 9:50 AM, a money changer first bought 50 taels from a cash dealer at 2039 yuan. Subsequently, a securities firm bought 50 taels from a cash dealer at 40 yuan. Later, the money changer bought another 50 taels from a cash dealer at the same price (reportedly on behalf of wealthy individuals in the city). After hearing that foreign exchange was being secretly purchased by Tientsin foreign exchange banks, the underlying trend immediately tightened, leading another money changer to aggressively buy on behalf of Tientsin and Hong Kong syndicates. The price also rose accordingly. Another money changer bought 50 taels from a cash dealer at 42 yuan. With sellers mostly standing aside, the money changer further bought 50 taels from a gold dealer at a jump of 46 yuan. Fortunately, a silver shop suddenly sold on behalf of many profit-taking clients, curbing the upward trend. Another money changer bought 100 taels from a silver shop at 45 yuan and 46 yuan. Later, a money changer also sold on behalf of clients, gradually pushing the price down, selling 50 taels to a gold dealer at 46 yuan, then selling 50 taels to another money changer at 44.5 yuan. Another silver shop sold 50 taels to another money changer at 44 yuan. After a period of stabilization, another money changer bought 50 taels from a cash dealer at 42 yuan at 11:00 AM. Finally, another money changer bought 50 taels from a cash dealer at 45 yuan as the noon closing price. At 1:45 PM, the money changer bought 50 taels from a colleague at 47 yuan. Afterwards, the foreign exchange market, affected by aggressive purchases by foreign firms, saw its underlying trend soften, boosting confidence in the market. Tientsin and Hong Kong syndicates continued to absorb currency aggressively, while sellers mostly stood aside. The market price then broke through the 50 yuan mark. Silver shops made 50 tael transactions with each other at 53 yuan. A gold dealer bought 50 taels from a money changer at 55 yuan. The money changer then bought 50 taels from a colleague at 57 yuan as the highest price. Afterwards, due to some clients taking profits, the price fell back. Silver shops sold 50 taels to money changers at 55 yuan, and money changers made 50 tael transactions with each other at 53 yuan. Finally, money changers made 50 tael transactions with each other at 2054 yuan as the late closing price, up 9 yuan from last Saturday. The selling price of cash gold dealer's current brand gold was 206 yuan, and the buying price was 2045 yuan. The current benchmark gold price was 50 yuan lower than the posted gold price.</p>
<p>Jewelry Up 1 Yuan</p>
<p>The price of silver jewelry per tael initially remained unchanged. At 2:30 PM, spot gold was approaching the 60 yuan mark, leading to a 1 yuan increase in jewelry prices. Da Tong Hang and Lao Qingyun raised the price to 208 yuan, while Xin Tong Hang quoted 206 yuan and bought back at 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Customs Gold Down Slightly</p>
<p>The Central Bank's purchase price for Chinese cash was 1212.8 yuan for both spot and future. The posted Customs gold price was also down slightly by 0.001 yuan, calculated at 2.396 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also fell by 0.4 yuan to 1208.2 yuan, due to the sudden contraction of British pure gold by half a penny per ounce in the London telegraph report on the 4th.</p>
<h3>Wealthy Individuals Buy Foreign Currencies Again - British and American Gold Pounds Surge</h3>
<p>Last Saturday, British pure gold fell by half a penny, British and American exchange rates remained unchanged, and the foreign currency black market contracted sharply. The trend seemed difficult to contain for a while, due to the North China authorities' relentless efforts to destroy the legal tender. They have now decided to ban its circulation starting from March 10. Under pressure, the people of North China have little resistance. Wealthy individuals are not only transferring legal tender to Shanghai and Hong Kong, but also exchanging it for foreign currency or cash, leading to a sharp increase in demand for foreign exchange and cash. Banks and brokerage firms are constantly purchasing, but local banks' willingness to sell is weak, and supply is difficult. Moreover, foreign firms' settlements are very strong. Although Hong Kong Electric's supply is still strong, it is difficult to meet the huge demand, resulting in a very tense situation. Spot gold is weak due to exchange rates, and Tientsin syndicates' buying appetite is strong. Market prices are rising gradually, although profit-taking is not lacking. Gold dealers, money changers, and speculators are actively accumulating, fueling the trend to profit, which is truly heart-wrenching. Foreign currencies, boosted by weak foreign exchange and high spot gold prices, are rising rapidly, and the acquisition by wealthy individuals is making them even more expensive. Profit-taking sales are strong, and the pursuit of high prices is even stronger, making the situation very sharp. Trading volume was very high throughout the day. Public Association trading was also strong. Dingyuan sold to Yongtai for British gold pounds 50, also sold to Qintai for British gold pounds 50. Baotai sold to Tongfeng for British gold pounds 30, also sold to Sen Tai for Singapore dollars 50. Yongsheng sold to Qintai for American gold pounds 20, Baoxiang sold to Hongchang for British gold pounds 60, Hongchang sold to Jinda for American gold pounds 10. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pound up 0.3 yuan, British gold note up 0.22 yuan, American gold pound up 0.6 yuan, American gold note up 0.055 yuan, Hong Kong note up 0.018 yuan, French franc note up 0.001 yuan, Singapore note up 0.03 yuan, Dutch note up 0.02 yuan, Robi note up 0.025 yuan, Canadian note up 0.07 yuan, Philippine note up 0.03 yuan, Australian gold note up 0.2 yuan. Only Annam note, Italian note, German gold note, and Hallore note remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Declines</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange and draft bills gradually declined. It initially hovered between 35 and 36 yuan per thousand, then 35.5 yuan at noon, and 35.25 yuan in the afternoon, down 0.075 yuan compared to last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Securities - Rumors of New Loan Agreement - Bond Market Fluctuates</h3>
<p>Yesterday's security black market situation fluctuated greatly. In the morning, it was sluggish, but in the afternoon, the rumor of a new American loan agreement injected a strong stimulant, suddenly turning it into an upsurge. While there is the possibility of a new American loan, the reality is still far away. However, it cannot be denied that the market's buying sentiment has increased. The noticeable factors throughout the day were No. 10's initial intention to sell, which continued to sell without stopping, and the surge in physical goods represented by No. 5 on behalf of a certain bank, which hindered the rise. The major sellers did not stop, and the rise was limited in the end.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the long-term bonds fluctuated rapidly. Initially, No. 15 compensated for short positions on behalf of the major sellers, and then Tiansheng and Lemao exclusively bought Class A bonds, which strengthened the trend. However, the high prices then caused No. 10 to sell again, weakening the trend. No. 5's representation of financial circles resulted in a flow of physical goods, turning the rising trend into a falling trend. At the same time, although Tongkang absorbed aggressively, many retail investors also took profit, ultimately making it difficult to push the price up. Many bonds fell back by as much as one yuan. In the afternoon, rumors of a new Sino-American loan agreement spread throughout the market, causing a sudden rise. No. 20 compensated for short positions on behalf of the major sellers, Tiansheng increased long positions, and No. 10 and others stopped selling. Market sentiment was strong, and the buyers suddenly gained the upper hand. All bonds returned to high of 0.5 or 0.6 yuan. The Class D bonds, which had not been traded for many days, only had a small number of transactions, so they rose uniquely by 1.5 yuan compared to before. Trading in 96 was also quite lively, stopping the falling trend. As a result, Class A bonds only fell slightly by 0.15 yuan, while most others rose by 0.3 or 0.5 yuan, except for Class D bonds, which rose by 1.5 yuan. The total transaction volume was estimated to be over 900,000 yuan. The following is a brief table:</p>
<p>Stock trading was sluggish again. There were very few transactions in the China General Edison Company stock, and the price was still firm. The rest were all under discussion.</p>
<p>The American-owned China Land Company developed six-percent corporate bonds worth 500,000 yuan in 1934, with a fixed term of 10 to 30 years for repayment. Interest was paid at the end of June and December each year. The Yangtze Insurance Association underwrote the management of the bonds at No. 26, The Bund, this city.  It has been learned that these bonds will be redeemed at 90 percent of their face value starting from the 14th of this month (February), along with the payment of interest due on the principal, calculated from January 1 to the date of redemption, totaling 45 days.  These bonds were previously traded at 70 percent of their face value on December 8th of last year. Recently, someone offered to buy them at 99.25 yuan.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton - Sales Improve - Cotton Yarn Rise Resumes - Various Yarns Rise by 5, 6, or 7 Yuan - Manufacturers Open in Large Quantities Again</h3>
<p>The yarn market's rising trend is intensifying, with robust sales in areas such as Chaozhou, Shantou, Fujian, and Yunnan.  Generally, colleagues are also tracking the trend due to the improving environment, resulting in a tight supply.  Fortunately, factories are resuming sales during the rise to meet demand, and market sentiment is still able to stabilize.  However, with active actual demand, domestic customers are further boosted.  The prices of 20-count Double Horse and Angel brand yarns are rising sharply, with selling prices returning to 4034 yuan, only 2 yuan short of the highest peak of 406 yuan on January 25.  Whether the price will break through the previous high depends on customer sales.</p>
<p>In the current yarn market, market sentiment opened normally in the morning, with a rise of 2 yuan for 20-count Biema to 400 yuan, but the amount sold was very small, with 30 bales traded between colleagues.  Soon, actual demand from Fujian improved, with a very strong buying appetite and a large amount of orders.  At the same time, buyers from Hong Kong, Shantou, Yunnan, inland regions, and Jiangxi were actively purchasing.  Market prices advanced step by step, improving with each transaction.  Finally, the price of Tian Nu reached 404 yuan, and Double Horse reached 403 yuan.  The market remained tight after closing.  The total volume traded in the morning was 2,042 bales, with fewer transactions between colleagues and more actual business.  460 bales were traded the previous day, for a total of 2,502 bales.  In terms of prices, 20-count Double Horse was up 5 yuan from the previous day, Tian Nu was up 7 yuan, Double Globe was up 4.5 yuan, Tejincheng was flat, Eight Immortals was up 5 yuan, and San Ding was up 2 yuan.  10-count coarse yarns rose significantly.  Factories increased their sales again, with Shenxin Factory selling 950 bales of 10-count Boy Scout at a price of 296 yuan, Rongfeng Factory selling 50 bales of Golden Bridge at a price of 397.5 yuan, Xinyu Factory selling 50 bales of 10-count Biandiqiu at a price of 299 yuan, and Yongan Factory selling 200 bales of 20-count Tejincheng at a price of 400 yuan. The bills of lading were all current.  Yesterday, 80 pieces of yarn came from Tianjin, and today 55 pieces will be shipped to Tianjin.  The trading volume of each region is recorded below:</p>
<p>Colleagues 635 Shantou 665</p>
<p>Fuzhou 170 Hong Kong 50</p>
<p>Ningbo 2 Yunnan 140</p>
<p>Xiamen 20 Inland 220</p>
<p>Jiangxi 100 Wenzhou 40</p>
<p>Statistics -</p>
<p>The supplementary record of the previous day's transactions is as follows:</p>
<p>Colleagues 110 Yunnan 460</p>
<p>Statistics 460</p>
<p>Total transactions for two days: 2,502</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market: actual demand is still depressed, but market prices remain firm due to buyers' strong intention and unwillingness to sell easily if prices fall. The market is therefore stable. The current price for 20-count Shuiyue yarn is 328 yuan, but there are no transactions for February. The current price for 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 323 yuan, and the spot price for March and April is 328.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Currently, the spot price for 20-count cotton yarn, such as Double Horse, is already 395 yuan. Many readers want to know the actual cost and have requested this information. In order to satisfy readers' desire for knowledge, this newspaper will provide an example of the cost components of 20-count cotton yarn:</p>
<p>The above calculation is based on a yarn package using 350 catties of cotton (Sima weight). The cost of cotton per yarn package is 278.25 yuan. Adding manufacturing costs, operating expenses, miscellaneous expenses, and unified taxes totals 55 yuan. The net cost is 333.25 yuan. From this, the profit per yarn package can be calculated.</p>
<p>395 - (278.25 + 55.00) = 61.75</p>
<p>That is, the profit for each yarn package is 61.75 yuan.</p>
<p>However, this is just an example. The actual situation depends on the internal conditions of each yarn factory. (A)</p>
<p>Silk Industry</p>
<h3>Why Have Recent Silk Prices (Continued from 4th) Risen Excessively (Xiao He)</h3>
<p>The above-mentioned reasons from foreign markets are more focused on general and principled reasons. Regarding the explanation of the excessive rise in silk prices, it also needs a chronological coincidence to break out in recent times, and still summarizes the silk numbers from New York last month - a kind of reaction caused by temporary reasons in the market - to tell us.</p>
<p>According to the report of the Silk Association of America, there is indeed a reason that can stimulate the rise of silk prices in the New York silk market in January, that is, in January, the actual sales of raw silk in the United States increased by 5,612 dan, and imports decreased by 6,172 dan. This made the ending inventory in New York at the end of January decrease by 4,724 dan. Not only that, in mid-February, the total amount of raw silk shipped to the United States from various places also decreased by a huge 12,700 dan compared with the previous month. This amount is nearly one-third of the usual total consumption of raw silk in New York. This situation stimulated the gradual rise in silk prices in the middle of the month, and the statistical figures have further promoted the rapid rise in silk prices this week.</p>
<p>Secondly, we must talk about the situation in the city.</p>
<p>In the anti-Japanese war's domestic silk-producing areas, the inability to maintain post-war output is expected, so Shanghai's silk market after the war is often detached from the trend of the world's silk market. At the same time, the operators of the local silk industry excessively ignored the foreign situation. So in the past year, when foreign countries were urgently absorbing and looking for 20-22 denier white silk, it gave foreign countries a bargain. This matter was admitted by an experienced silk industry person who admitted his negligence a few months ago. At the same time, due to this gentleman's reminder, most silk merchants also remembered the following phenomenon: Since September last year, all silk telegrams from Shanghai to New York, London, and Lyon, regardless of when or what market price, the foreign response was often unconditional acceptance of 20-22 denier raw silk, slightly lowering the price of 16-18 denier raw silk and accepting it. Third, all 13-15 denier raw silk was completely returned, without any attention. Under the negligence of this phenomenon, Shanghai silk manufacturers have completely emptied all recent goods. When the price of white raw silk advanced to 1100 yuan, the futures for December were almost empty. Then followed the skyrocketing silk prices, which soared smoothly to 1350 yuan. At this time, Shanghai white silk's delivery in February and March also already had owners.</p>
<p>In the second point of this aspect, we must think about the needs of Shanghai silk factories. Local silk factories have always used white raw silk returned by foreign firms as the main source of raw materials, because this kind of raw silk with a relatively decisive quality is cheaper when it hits a wall in foreign firms, and it is much more reliable than ordinary raw silk with no standard. Generally, silk factories are happy to buy it, but under the above-mentioned reasons, because of the urgent demand from foreign countries and the rising silk prices, it is rarely found to be returned by foreign firms, but silk prices extremely stimulated the consumer market, so silk factories had to compete for their own raw material sources at high prices. This resulted in the shift of the center of gravity of the silk market, with the silk prices of users about a hundred yuan higher than the import prices of foreign firms. The reason why silk factories are so eager for raw materials is, of course, still due to seasonal relations: winter and March are the weaving season for spring and summer silk materials, which is the time when the most silk is used. We should not forget this. This is the case not only in China, but also throughout the world.</p>
<p>Combining the above two parts of the reasons, the recent soaring silk prices are really the result of blind operation, and such a soaring silk price is not only not a place for the silk industry itself to be happy, but on the contrary, those who are under the pressure of this rising price are still their own people, and as a result, even the silk industry itself does not benefit.</p>
<p>"We are originally born from the same root, why should we be so eager to fight each other?" This sentence is sincerely dedicated to the silk merchants and silk factories.</p>
<h3>Sales of Native Cotton Also Weak</h3>
<p>The price of foreign cotton, the New York cotton market, has been under discussion for many days due to the issue of Washington sealing the sale of government-funded cotton. It has not been resolved yet, so the cotton price is quite constrained. Most of the market transactions are spot and arbitrage. Factories' interest in current cotton is not as strong as before. Yesterday, it rose two pound coins. India stopped trading, and the forecast was unchanged. Egypt rose one or two pound coins. Yesterday, the exchange rate weakened again. Converted into legal currency, the price of cotton rose. US cotton and Brazilian cotton rose by 20 cents per dan, Indian cotton rose by 10 cents, and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 30 cents.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in Shanghai is very quiet. Even the Japanese manufacturers have no intention of importing foreign cotton recently. On the Chinese factory side, Shenxin has stopped purchasing for a week, and there is no intention to purchase within the year. The Chinese factories in the Tianjin area, which are known for cotton production, also plan to purchase foreign cotton in Shanghai due to the lack of cotton in stock. They are now contacting Shanghai separately. The Japanese factories in North China also need cotton very urgently. Japanese merchants have transported a large amount of foreign cotton to Tianjin. Yesterday's trading was silent. The prices of foreign cotton are listed below:</p>
<p>The native cotton business is as sparse as the morning stars. The factory's appetite is not healthy, and the Japanese factories are indifferent. They have absolutely no intention of getting involved in native cotton. This is because the Indian ships arriving in Shanghai these days are extremely crowded. All the warehouses are full. The factories have sufficient raw materials for current use, more than enough. Therefore, although the sales of yarn and cloth have recovered, the current cotton is still dull. Only the new Xin Sheng spinning factory has some consumption, but the amount is very small. Goods from Northern Jiangsu: Tongzhou flower arrived 1,494 bales on the 5th, and 834 bales on the 6th. New Port cotton 290 pieces. The opening quotation and transaction volume of current cotton are recorded as follows:</p>

<h3>Silk Prices Still Climbing to New Highs, Jili Silk Cocoons Sold for 900 Yuan, Some Shipped to Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market, New York stopped trading, Yokohama spot price 913 yuan, closing price 930 yuan, forward price 903 yuan, afternoon closing price 912 yuan. However, the purchase price of white factory silk by British and French foreign firms was 1,460 yuan. Because the manufacturers held the price firmly, there was no transaction. Yinzhuang Jili silk black star grade has been sold for 900 yuan. The silk market is still climbing to new highs, so trading is not prosperous. Yesterday, the total transaction volume was 30 dans.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (5th), 352 pieces of Lake silk and 162 pieces of silk waste were shipped to Europe, and 55 pieces of cocoons were shipped to France.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Rumor that Dutch Sugar Cannot be Re-exported in Xiamen, Few Offers for National Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was another rumor that Dutch sugar could not be re-exported in Xiamen, so the trend was still tight. The association quoted 24 yuan for foreign warehouse goods of No. 24 Dutch coarse white, 24 yuan 15 cents for local warehouse goods, and 24 yuan 25 cents for Da Jin Qian Mai. Re-exported Dutch coarse white, 16 yuan for outgoing, and 15 yuan 90 cents for incoming, without any agreement. No. 5 Dutch red spot, 200 bags traded at 16 yuan 55 cents. Re-exported goods were still 11 yuan. Taikoo car white B mark, 23 yuan 30 cents for delivery in the East Warehouse, and 23 yuan 45 cents for delivery in the West Warehouse, more than 500 bags traded. CX mark 23 yuan 15 cents in the East Warehouse, CW mark 23 yuan 20 cents, DY mark 23 yuan 10 cents, HX mark 23 yuan. The local factory's cotton white has not changed. Zhenji No. 1 is more than 25 yuan after tax refund. Local factory No. 1 ice 32 yuan 20 cents, the Chao Gang offered a batch of branch goods, the higher price was 16 yuan 50 cents to 16 yuan, and the final price was 15 yuan 80 cents to 15 yuan 30 cents, with a total transaction of more than 600 bags.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 120 pieces of sugar came from Beihai, 130 pieces from Haikou, and 200 bags from Shantou.</p>

<h3>Foreign Wheat Continues to Arrive in Shanghai, Reaching 25,000 Tons, Native Wheat Expensive and Flour Sales Not Smooth</h3>
<p>Flour sales yesterday were slightly better than before. Because it was the beginning of the week, both buyers and sellers were more interested. Nanyang Gang No. 2 flour had sporadic transactions. The Northern Gang was flooded with local foreign flour, and the demand for Shanghai flour was not smooth. The by-product flour was attracting attention. The total market transaction volume of No. 2 and No. 4 flour was 20,000 to 30,000 bags each. Che Chuan Pai No. 2 flour was sold at the original price of 4 yuan 80 cents. No. 4 Red God of Wealth flour was sold for 4 yuan 20 cents, which was looser than before. The market has entered a high-fixed and then weak situation. Today's export, 5,500 bags of flour are shipped to Tianjin, 2,000 bags are shipped to Yantai, and 13,000 bags are shipped to Weihaiwei.</p>
<p>The wheat market showed a slight increase, because only 4,000 to 5,000 bags arrived in the last two days. The sellers of the newly arrived goods were unwilling to sell easily because of the high cost. The factories had previously ordered foreign wheat, and another ship continued to arrive. Their demand for domestic wheat was also slack, so the transaction was not smooth. The total market only offered Jiangbei and Wuhu wheat, a total of 3,000 bags. Jiangbei wheat 6 yuan 60 cents, Wuhu wheat price 6 yuan 20 cents to 5 yuan 90 cents. Fuxin Factory bought 2,000 bags, and Fufeng Factory bought 1,000 bags. The market increased by several cents due to the small amount of inventory.</p>
<p>Recently, American wheat has been continuously transported. In addition to those for disaster relief, there are also many factories that handle it themselves. Yitai Company's Rile.v wheel carried 8,383 tons, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday. It is now reported that it will be imported this morning and berthed at No. 14. 15 floating pontoons for transshipment. The company's Jantze Fritzen, loaded with 8,893 tons, will arrive on the 19th. There is also Tianxiang Foreign Company's Harmatris wheel, loaded with 7,750 tons, which arrived the day before yesterday (5th) and is berthed at No. 17 and 18 floating pontoons. The American wheat loaded on the above-mentioned ships are all ordered by Da Fu Foreign Company on behalf of the factories.</p>
<h3>New Customer Xian Rice Stockpiled, Du Jing Sales Dim</h3>
<p>Xian rice is actively stockpiled, and the market continues to rise. High-quality goods are becoming increasingly unavailable from Nanjing and other areas. Wuhu special high-quality Xian was raised to 10 yuan 85 cents yesterday. The general market goods all followed suit, rising by about 20 cents compared to last weekend. There were merchants inquiring about stockpiling yesterday, which was quite lively. The total transaction volume for the day increased to about 2,500 bags.</p>
<p>The source of domestic rice totaled He Xia No. 2, and Che Lun Bao Zi had 6,000 to 7,000 bags. With the arrival of a large amount of goods, people's hearts softened. In addition, after a period of strong sales, the appetites of the local street and merchants were full, resulting in a downturn in sales yesterday. However, because the sellers in the market still had strong intentions, the price was stable. As a result, the market for Bo Jing rice remained at the original price. Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian were stable, and the path for Yuan's departure was also weak, resulting in a lack of price fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Although the Ningbo Cotton Weaving Industry Appealed, the Transaction Volume of Eastern Cloth Did Not Decrease</h3>
<p>Domestic cloth from Sichuan, Yunnan, Shantou, and the local street's bleached grey cloth are still selling well. Local merchants are also working hard to absorb them. Both spot and forward goods have wholesale transactions. Yarn su silk and cotton fabric, both large and small shirt merchants in the local street have been mobilized, with daily transactions of 2,000 to 3,000 pieces. Sichuan merchants also have wholesale shipments. The opening price this year is 36-37 cents per yard, while the sales price last autumn was only 22-23 cents. 42-count yarn silk cotton fabric currently sells for 46-47 cents per yard in the market, compared to 34-35 cents last autumn. The price has increased by 30%. It is said that the main reason is the lack of imports of fine yarn money grey cloth from Japan after the war, and the sharp rise in the raw materials of Japanese factory New yarn and thread in the local port. It is said that before the war, more than 20,000 pieces of this fine yarn and thread grey cloth were transported here annually. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants are still selling well. Spot and forward goods are continuing to purchase more than 300 pieces. Shantou merchants are handling more than 100 boxes of fine twill fine cloth cotton fabric, color cloth, and blue cloth from factories such as Lun Chang. Merchants in the interior along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line, such as Guangfeng, are adding more than 2,000 pieces of miscellaneous cotton cloth from wholesale stores in this city. Local merchants in this city are purchasing more than 100 pieces of fine cloth, fine twill, and Yihua coarse cloth produced by Shenxin Yong'an factories.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of white fine cloth from the East increased slightly, with the price of each piece increasing by 25 cents. Tianjin merchants imported 300 packages of 12-pound fine cloth of various brands such as Longtou Caiqiu Feiyu Labao. Wholesale stores in the local street also added more than 300 pieces of fine cloth. The total amount of fine cloth futures contracts for February, March, and April thrown out reached 1,500 to 1,600 pieces. Ito Foreign Company offered the most, 900 pieces, Dongmian 400 pieces, and Nissin Jiang Shang each offered 200 to 300 packages. The prices are listed below: Nengtou fine cloth 12 yuan per piece, Feiyu fine cloth 12 yuan 10 cents, Labao fine cloth 11 yuan 70 cents, Lan Shuangyu fine cloth 11 yuan 60 cents, Longtou fine twill futures are priced at 11 yuan 75 cents, so there were no sales.</p>
<p>The Ningbo Weaving Industry Association previously stated that "the cotton weaving and knitting factories of the association members are restricted by government orders, and the dumping of Japanese goods in Shanghai—more than 90% of the cotton weaving, knitting, and dyeing industries in Shanghai use Japanese yarn and Japanese cloth. Their products are called domestic products, but are actually modified products of Japanese goods. If they are allowed to sell well in the interior, the financial resources will flow out, not only will the factories in the interior collapse, but also the wartime economy will be unsustainable." They requested the government to prohibit their transportation and sale in the interior. However, because empty words cannot be realized, the cotton weaving industries in Shanghai, which are making a fortune from the national crisis, are not moved and continue to do their own thing.</p>
<p>Today, 70 pieces of piece goods are exported to Tianjin, and 210 pieces are exported to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Black and White Pepper Inventory Insufficient</h3>
<p>The source of pepper is extremely scarce recently, and sales are quite active, resulting in the depletion of inventory. The current market price of No. 1 pepper is 61-62 yuan, black large pepper is 58-59 yuan, and Wendao white pepper is 95 yuan, an increase of 3-5 yuan compared to before. Today, Shandong wheel imported 30 pieces of sea cucumber.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Green Cakes Continue to Loosen</h3>
<p>The price of green cakes in the recent market has continued to loosen. Ordinary packaged goods are slightly lower, opening at 12 yuan 30 cents. Boxed ranked cakes have also dropped by 40-50 cents, with the higher price opening at 13 yuan, and the final price at 12 yuan 50 cents. It is said that the demand from the interior has weakened slightly.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Interior Adding New Year Goods, Soybean Oil Rises Suddenly by 30 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean oil trading suddenly became lively, and the market rose suddenly by 20-30 cents. This is because the interior is adding New Year goods, and the market is in the process of closing, with few sellers, resulting in a soaring market atmosphere. The total market traded 400-500 barrels of Dalian spot soybean oil. It opened at 28 yuan 20 cents in the morning, and each transaction gradually increased, resulting in a closing price of 28 yuan 35 cents. Since a batch of peanut oil, which was rained on, was sold off, people's hearts were once hit. Recently, the potential trend has stabilized, and the market has also maintained the original price. It is estimated that 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded yesterday, and the price is still 21 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Yellow Steel Wire Trading Prosperous, Black Iron Billets Selling Well in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Yellow Steel Wire: Recently, due to the good environment, the trend is rising. However, spring factories, thermos bottle factories, and iron bed factories are in urgent need, resulting in the depletion of Ishtar-brand varieties on the market. The Yantai and Tianjin gangs are also constantly purchasing for fishing hooks, so the trading to the Japanese market is frequent. The total volume reached 600-700 dans. Therefore, the circulation of goods on the market is extremely weak, and the sellers have raised prices one after another. For example, Zu Hua is priced at 17 yuan per dan in the market, the middle-grade variety is sold at 18 yuan 50 cents, and the fine variety is priced at around 20 yuan. As for a kind of mixed goods, it is priced at around 15 yuan per dan. However, the actual transactions have been smooth for days, and people's hearts are very good.</p>
<p>Black Iron Billets: The Tianjin gang has been purchasing for days, such as Yongji and Wantai, purchasing more than 300 tons (estimated at more than 6,000 dans), resulting in the exhaustion of spot goods on the market. However, due to the end of the year, the holders are eager to sell, so there is a sigh of decline. The initial price was 29 yuan (calculated per 200 pounds), and it gradually returned to 28 yuan 45 cents. The price of forward goods sold was 38 yuan 30 cents. However, the retail price of each box in the local street is still 29 yuan to 29 yuan 25 cents.</p>
<h3>Paper: Tin Foil Prices Increase for Year-End Sales</h3>
<p>Tin Foil: Recently, due to the need for the New Year, the digestion is increasing day by day. The source is that the labor force in the place of origin is lacking, and the production volume cannot meet expectations. Therefore, although the price of tin, the raw material, has fallen back, the cost of labor has increased. The retail sales of each store are difficult to make a profit due to the high miscellaneous expenses. Therefore, the wholesale price of each piece still maintains the original price, and the retail price of each piece in the store continues to increase by 2 cents.</p>
<h3>Coal: Anthracite Coal is in Short Supply</h3>
<p>Wenzhou large basket anthracite coal has been in short supply recently, and the price is firm. It is found that the current number of units shipped from the Oujiang River is only more than 1,000 dans in total. It is said that the price is 5 yuan 20 cents per dan for a 40-pound large basket, 4 yuan 40 cents for a 30-pound basket, 3 yuan 80 cents for a flat basket of Qi Qing, and 1 yuan 80 cents for a small basket of He Tan. The same industry Yangjingbang wharf arranges car delivery, adding another 5 cents per dan for the car force.</p>
<h3>Import and Export: Bulk Goods Shipped to Europe, Medicinal Materials Also Imported</h3>
<p>The day before yesterday (5th), a large amount of goods was shipped to Europe, including 170 pieces of yarn waste, 10 pieces of leather, 209 boxes of leaves, 20 pieces of intestines, 15 pieces of hair, 25 pieces of egg yolk, 8 pieces of rhubarb, and 844 pieces of tobacco leaves. There were also 14,300 pieces of paper shipped to Qingdao.</p>
<p>Yesterday's imports included 830 pieces of tobacco leaves from Ningbo, 980 pieces of paper, 8 pieces of wool crepe from Tianjin, and 2,600 pieces of goods from Shantou.</p>
<p>Also, this issue's Guangdong wheel arrived at the port, carrying 32 pieces of medicinal materials from Haiphong, 5 pieces of galangal from Hong Kong, and 77 pieces of fruit peel.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Losses of National Colleges and Universities in Our Country Due to the War: 50 Killed, Injured, and Missing from 18 National Schools, Property Losses Exceeding 22.49 Million Yuan</h3>

<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Education Departments Promote Education in Guerrilla Areas: Private Schools Established in Jiangsu, and Education Groups Established in Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Since August 13th, due to the environmental conditions in various guerrilla areas, all primary schools have been suspended, except for a portion of secondary and above schools that have been relocated. This has caused a feeling that school-age children in various areas cannot attend school. The Ministry of Education has paid great attention to this point and has already formulated an entire implementation plan, which has been circulated to all provinces and cities for implementation. The implementation of education in the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is recorded below:</p>
<p>Private Village Schools Established in Jiangsu Province: Regarding the implementation of education in the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu Province, since the establishment of the various guerrilla area county governments, each county has been assigned a county education director, so the administrative structure of education in the guerrilla areas has been established. In addition to planning to restore primary schools at all levels, it has been decided to use the form of private schools in villages, secretly established in various villages. At the same time, a mobile approach is adopted, and the location is not fixed. The counties of Tong, Chong, Qi, and Hai have successively implemented this, and it has been quite effective.</p>
<p>Mobile Education Adopted in Zhejiang Province: The implementation of education in the guerrilla areas of Zhejiang Province has completely adopted a mobile approach. Last month, five mobile education groups were added to teach the people in the various guerrilla areas of Western Zhejiang. The locations are: the eleventh group in Pinghu, the twelfth group in Jiaxing and Jiashan, the thirteenth group in Chongde and Tongxiang, the fourteenth group in Anji and Changxing, and the fifteenth group in Yuhang and Wukang. Each group has one director and a varying number of staff members.</p>
<h3>School News</h3>
<p>Huiling Middle School: The original campus of the private Huiling Middle School was in Xinlonghua. During the August 13th Anti-Japanese War, the school was located in the war zone and the school buildings were bombed. Then it moved to the mansion at No. 336 Gordon Road (intersection of Xinzha Road) in the Shanghai Public Concession and continued to open. The principal is Wang Pengnian, and the director of studies is Liu Qihong. There are currently 300 high and junior high school students divided into seven groups, with full-day classes.

Registration will start, and classes will begin on the 12th of this month.</p>
<p>Second Zhonghua Vocational School: Due to the large increase in students, the Jiangxi Road school building of the Second Zhonghua Vocational Supplementary School is no longer sufficient. Recently, the entire third floor of No. 330 Henan Road, Beijing Road has been moved to as the new school address. In addition to hiring famous professors, the knowledge lectures have been expanded.</p>

<p>School Overview</p>
<h3>Dazhong Middle School</h3>
<p>Dazhong Middle School was originally located on Kunshan Road. The first principal was Zhang Zhirang. Since its establishment, eight years have passed in an instant. The academic subjects strive for practicality, and the education and management have always been strict. It won a first-class certificate in the third joint examination in this city. Later, Wu Ruinian and Li Shouhei took over as principals, and they devoted themselves to improving the academic subjects, expanding the equipment, and rectifying discipline to adapt to the current environment. The August 13th War broke out, and the school fell into the war zone. Except for important books and instruments, the rest were not moved out, and the losses were not small. Now the school has moved to the mansion at No. 115, opposite the Zhongnan Bank on Hankou Road (ie Sanma Road), and continues to open. Since this semester, it has been jointly run by the former Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Faculty and Staff Association. The principal is Wu Zonghan, who was formerly the executive chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Association. This time, he extensively recruited excellent teachers from provincial schools such as Shangzhong, Suzhouzhong, Xizhong, Songzhong, Tongzhong, Xishi, Taishi, and Huangshi to take charge of education and duties. The important educational staff include Li Chucai, Zhu Zaimin, Wu Ruinian, Zhu Huibo, Zhu Fenghao, Hua Zhiwen, Yang Fengting, Wei Jiguang, Lu Fuxia, Shen Zuifeng, Ren Zuti, Xu Jingqing, Zhou Jinglian, Wu Zaolu, Pu Shunqing, Li Yesan, Jiang Wenhua, Gu Zhongchao, etc. They are running the school in the spirit of running a provincial school.

Next semester, the number of classes will be expanded, and the number of places will be increased. In addition to recruiting transfer students from all grades of senior and junior high schools, new freshmen will also be recruited for the first grade of junior high school in the spring to relieve out-of-school youth.</p>

<h3>Sino-Foreign Middle School Football Tournament: American Children Win the Championship; Full Results Announced</h3>
<p>The first Sino-Foreign Middle School Football Tournament, organized by the American Children's Public Association, has been successfully completed. Only one match remains between North West Children and Nie Zhongcheng, but the outcome is irrelevant to the overall situation. West Fords has won all seven matches and ranks first.

<h3>On Jiuqu Ridge</h3>
<p>— Shao Guang</p>
<p>In the twelfth lunar month, snow is falling in the sky,</p>
<p>The plum blossoms on Jiuqu Ridge,</p>
<p>Are blooming in profusion.</p>
<p>Among the lonely flower shadows,</p>
<p>The muzzles of small cannons are hidden.</p>
<p>Solid trenches are dug on the mountainside,</p>
<p>Flickering with the shadows of guards.</p>
<p>"Come and die, you enemies at the foot of the mountain!"</p>
<p>A loyal and brave machine gunner,</p>
<p>Says excitedly and calmly,</p>
<p>His face full of a confident smile.</p>
<p>Clap, clap, clap...</p>
<p>The sound of guns striking the enemy rings out,</p>
<p>In a tense moment,</p>
<p>Dozens of corpses lie diagonally on the snowy ground,</p>
<p>Crimson blood, portraying</p>
<p>The crimes and cruelty of the invaders!</p>
<p>Poor dead ghosts,</p>
<p>Who told you to leave your homeland, abandon your wives and children,</p>
<p>And come here to commit suicide and murder?</p>
<p>What are you doing all this for?</p>
<p>The flag of the Blue Sky with a White Sun,</p>
<p>Smiles on the high ridge,</p>
<p>The cry of victory in the War of Resistance,</p>
<p>Surges in the snowflakes.</p>
<p>Plum blossoms in profusion,</p>
<p>Send out wisps of fragrance,</p>
<p>As if to commend the loyalty and bravery of the soldiers.</p>
<p>The vast wilderness shows no trace of the enemy,</p>
<p>They have been defeated—</p>
<p>And fled into a dead city ten miles away.</p>
<p>Ah, this heroic battle,</p>
<p>Has given the enemy another serious lesson!</p>
<h3>The Garden Full of Spring Cannot Be Contained</h3>
<p>— By Jin Zhenxiong</p>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<p>— Chi Qiang</p>
<p>Write, write, write...</p>
<p>Keep writing, but what exactly should one write about?</p>
<p>Yes, the most important thing is the heroic spirit of valor; sketch it out in a couple of strokes, and soon a magnificent and typical character will emerge; keep moving.</p>
<p>But, I can't handle the majestic images of Liangshan heroes? If the beginning is wrong, don't show off your ax near Lu Ban’s door; everyone understands this. Besides, a smart person often laughs at fools for blindly blundering and doing something thankless.</p>
<p>"Love between men and women," write something tearful, okay?</p>
<p>No! What era is this, friend? Who will accept your "sobbing" and "playing the qin and singing loudly"?</p>
<p>I can't write, that's it! Can't write anything. Close the door to get rid of greasy, fishy smells, cut off the gossamer threads of "drifting with ease"— the drifting filaments.</p>
<p>However, "Those who aspire can do likewise," either don't do it, or do it thoroughly. Small items of literary work, miscellaneous family possessions, rouse your spirits, come on! Don't casually let go of the little birds that habitually hover without landing in your thoughts or imagination. Reopen the mind that was closed; might as well carve out a few sentences. Be honored to contribute to the victory of the War of Resistance!</p>
<p>Something superficially flashy, alas! I've racked my brains, but can't find a single sentence. Probably a "skillful hand" would produce something even without "searching," and it would be "crisp and loose":</p>
<p>"The moon shines on a thousand pools, reflecting the cold emerald of West Lake on a big night..."</p>
<p>Another one with ulterior motives is here. Look, wake up; the era is turning that way. Shouldn't you turn around and catch up?</p>
<p>Here's something standardized:</p>
<p>Be careful what you write; write about what you know. Don't dwell on old dreams, and you should always study what the objective environment accepts and rejects. It is best to "transform" it with "spirit." I really feel like I'm about to give up.</p>
<p>Immediately, many people who pretend to know or are familiar with reality emerge. Write it out for those who don't know to read; perhaps everyone, in this moment of ignorance, will understand with a divine revelation and naturally piece together a kind of "of course" public opinion. This public opinion will soon "unite," so the "Eight-legged essay of the War of Resistance" (maybe a few legs short, since I don't have an authorized edition to verify) immediately becomes the number one "worn-out broom" in the literary world.</p>
<p>Speaking of "worn-out brooms," everyone would honestly and impolitely "cherish" them, even though they are decaying and powerless; even cleaning the house is difficult. However, if you say it doesn't deserve to be called a broom and kick it away, it will definitely stare at you, and there will be hatred between the creator and you. The most unbearable thing is the suspicion of "dividing the forces of resistance." Therefore, the literary world is crowded with this kind of person. For more than a year, how many works of art that deeply touched people's hearts have we seen?</p>
<p>"Don't please the enemy," cover up a bit, just accept it. It is said that after "aiming the gun outward," the wind of concealing evil and praising good immediately becomes pervasive and paralyzing. Being able to not be a traitor is enough to be content. A hundred and twenty million compatriots are misled; is it not "laborious" to "love" them? How much has the writing class achieved in terms of "labor"?</p>
<p>I will apologize to Yan Da in advance: I'm sorry I'm here again to stir up trouble and make mischief. Compatriots! We are all compatriots on the same front.</p>
<p>However, what I see are just compatriots, and more compatriots.</p>
<p>Avoiding the noise and dust, dispelling the hot blood, opening up cold doors, burning cold stoves, three or five friends, solemnly "our path is not lonely," promoting the "plump buttocks," collecting erotic photos from home and abroad, writing leisurely and contented articles.</p>
<p>A passionate young man, also a compatriot, said that he shouldn't be too far away from the reality of the times, and explained the meaning in a subtle way. The argument was said to be like this:</p>
<p>"As long as you don't write the plump buttocks as shriveled bellies, it's also reality!" Only then did I understand everything in front of me, and what is called "unity" and "united front" is all based on eating one’s fill. So I picked up my pen.</p>
<h3>Profile of a Dictator (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhe Fei</p>
<p>Stalin</p>
<p>At home in the evening, in the living room of a private apartment in the center of Soviet City, a shaded electric lamp emitted a harmonious and warm light. The light fell on a piano and on a slender young girl with black hair playing the piano. In a corner, a burly man with grayish-white hair combed back, a drooping mustache at the corner of his mouth, and a forehead full of thoughtful lines, sat quietly listening, his thoughtful gaze looking ahead.</p>
<p>The girl's name was Svetlana, only twelve years old, the daughter of the dictator of one hundred sixty-five million Russians, and the man listening to the piano was her father.</p>
<p>Only when his daughter was playing the piano in the evening could Stalin temporarily forget his responsibilities, the conspiracies around him, his illnesses, and his vigilance against assassination.</p>
<p>Svetlana was the daughter of Stalin's second wife, Nadezhda Alliluyeva, who had died six years earlier. Stalin saw a shadow of his wife in his daughter, and for her mother's sake, he caressed his daughter with a human warmth that was a striking contrast to his coldness as a dictator.</p>
<p>He also particularly doted on her. Svetlana was the most lively and lovable of his three children, one of whom was the son of his first wife, now twenty-one years old, and the other was seventeen-year-old Vasily, the son of Nadezhda. A loyal nanny was always with her, and two or three special detectives guarded her in secret.</p>
<p>Like other Russian children, she attended a national school, but had a tutor at home who specialized in English. She liked to listen to fairy tales and loved to play tennis and ice skate, but her greatest love was for her father, and her wishes were like commands to him.</p>
<p>She was raised with the ideals of the Soviet Republic, and she would have to fulfill the tasks of a Soviet public servant in the future. However, Stalin had recently even become jealous of her study time. He knew he might not have many years left, so he longed for his little daughter to be by his side, because only she could make him feel calm and at peace.</p>
<h3>Birthday</h3>
<p>— Ping Hen</p>
<p>Evening.</p>
<p>The round moon in the east quietly climbs up the treetops, faintly, with a wry smile on its face. Who is it? Someone must have had a frustrating experience.</p>
<p>…When my wise brother mentions his hometown, Ziqing can't help but shed tears. Let's go to the Looking-Hometown Terrace together; I wonder where our hometown is…</p>
<p>A bright sound of Jinghu (京胡) came over, so how could there be any frustration, the singing, the music, it truly is the most refined and moving music in the evening.</p>
<p>An old man walked over to me, as if he was my grandfather, with white hair, a bent beard, pursed lips, and gently asked: "How was the yaoban (搖板) section I just sang?"</p>
<p>"Not bad."</p>
<p>"Child! Have you forgotten? On your first, tenth, and twentieth birthdays, and even now, someone has been singing nice operas for you to listen to, and you won't forget it, now they are singing operas to celebrate your birthday."</p>
<p>"What? Celebrate my birthday?"</p>
<p>There was no grandfather there; my shadow was faintly printed on the ground. I stared at the shadow in a daze; how could it be, my birthday is today.</p>
<p>I lowered my head to think:</p>
<p>My loving mother caressed my hair and said softly: "Child! Today is your birthday, are you still wandering alone outside and not coming home?"</p>
<p>"What? I still have a home?"</p>
<p>"Silly child! Look."</p>
<p>There was no loving mother there, it was still just me alone, this is too strange, why is my birthday today. I looked up again at the moon; it was round and had climbed a lot higher, probably today is my birthday, I remember my birthday is always when the moon is round.</p>
<p>"Mom! I'm having a birthday again today," a child said to his mother.</p>
<p>"You jinx, having a birthday, whose life are you wasting?" a harsh voice said.</p>
<p>The child's cry broke through the evil atmosphere. The awakened me stood under the moonlight in a daze, forgetting everything, forgetting what I had just thought about.</p>
<p>Alone, without a place to settle down anywhere in the world, forget my birthday, as long as I have my life, I will have my birthday.</p>
<p>Hometown, everywhere is my hometown, my birthday, forget it, and forget hometown just like my birthday, I will think about my birthday again when I arrive in my hometown.</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>2.  Escaping and Going to the Disaster</p>
<p>Mr. Ye's house was located on the edge of the city near the fields, quite a distance from the township office. Commander Ye supported his father as they walked home, his bronze-colored square face seemed to be covered with a layer of dark clouds, appearing very gloomy.</p>
<p>As they walked along, the road that had been bustling when they came had suddenly become very deserted after the bombing. The shops had all closed their doors and were no longer doing business. In some houses, people were shouting and talking, vaguely saying that a bomb had fallen on the Wanchun Sauce Garden, killing seven people. The sauce jars had all been shattered, and eight houses had collapsed before and after, injuring many people. Mr. Ye shuddered, but didn't say anything. Commander Ye kept biting his lip, his eyes shooting out firm and angry light. And so they came to their house.</p>
<p>Mr. Ye lived in a three-bay, two-courtyard, three-story building. When they arrived, the door wasn't closed. They pushed the door open and went inside, but there was no one to be seen. No one knew where his family had gone. Commander Ye finally called out in the courtyard, and his younger brother Fang Ying ran out from under the back door staircase, saying:</p>
<p>"Big brother, we're all here."</p>
<p>Commander Ye pushed open the screen door at the back and looked inside, unable to help but burst into laughter. He saw straw spread under the staircase, and his mother Mrs. Ye, younger sister Fang Hui, youngest brother Fang Wen, and the servants were all huddled together sitting on the ground, with a wet cloth shirt covering Mrs. Ye's neck. This ridiculous sight made him unable to hold back his laughter for a long time, he just pointed at them and said:</p>
<p>"Come out quickly! You don't even have any basic air raid knowledge! How can such a fragile staircase protect you from bombs? If you are squeezed together like this, and a bomb really falls on you, wouldn't everyone be finished."</p>
<p>Mrs. Ye lifted the wet cloth shirt covering her head and stood up from the ground, her face pale and bloodless. As she walked out of the screen door, she repeatedly patted her chest, saying:</p>
<p>"Oh dear! So scary! Did the ×× plane leave already? That loud bang just now was really terrifying!"</p>
<p>"It's already gone far away, Mom, don't worry, it's okay," Commander Ye comforted his mother.</p>
<p>"Fang Jun," Mr. Ye called out in a very calm voice from the east wing, pacing back and forth in the room holding his white copper water pipe. When Commander Ye walked into the room, he sat down and pointed at the chair opposite him with the paper coal in his hand, saying: "Sit down, I have something to talk to you about."</p>
<p>At this time, Mrs. Ye also brought her children into the room, and everyone's eyes were focused on Commander Ye's face, as if everyone's fate was waiting for him to make the final decision. Mr. Ye took a puff of his pipe, blew the ashes onto the ground, and then began to speak to Commander Ye: (6)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>The Professional Ethics of a Doctor</h3>
<p>— Feng Zhiyin</p>
<p>The wise men of old said, "If one cannot be a good prime minister, then one should be a good doctor." The positions of doctor and prime minister are vastly different, and comparing them seems inappropriate. However, their intentions are the same: to benefit and assist others. Benevolence and skillful practice are essential, and in a broader sense, this is morality. It is said that only those with high moral character can hold the position of prime minister without shame. Similarly, only those with high moral character can wield the power of medicine without feeling unworthy of being called a good doctor. Treating people is akin to governing a country, and the ancients revered doctors for this reason, as does society today. However, I ask, even if their titles are noble, their knowledge profound, their skills proficient, and their instruments excellent, if their hearts are impure and they prioritize profit over service, it is difficult for them to truly benefit the people, and they are unworthy of being called good doctors. Furthermore, those who lack expertise and engage in deceit cause even greater harm to society, which is unimaginable. It is no wonder that the world feels that doctors are a mixed bag and gradually develops a sense of disdain and contempt, a stark contrast to the ancients who equated them with good prime ministers. This is simply due to a lack of professional ethics. As the saying goes, "People must first insult themselves before others will insult them." When it comes to professions, there are countless variations, and each has its own set of ethics to uphold, but the medical field is paramount. When people unfortunately suffer from illness and groan in pain, their desire for a doctor's treatment is akin to an infant reaching for its mother's loving embrace. How urgent is their expectation! If a doctor treats patients differently based on their social class or the level of compensation, and takes the treatment lightly, they have failed in their sacred mission. How much more so if they prioritize profit and disregard human life? Such people have forgotten the nobility of their profession and have descended to the level of shamans and sorcerers, a lowly and despicable group, which is truly lamentable! To be a doctor, one must not only have excellent knowledge and skills, and be equipped with the necessary instruments and tools, but also attach great importance to moral principles. Medicine is a charitable profession, with the highest goal being to benefit others. Without a compassionate and empathetic heart, and a sense of suffering alongside the patient, the goal is misguided, and the consequences are unpredictable. What value does such a profession hold for the individual? What value does such a doctor hold for society? Since I began practicing medicine more than a decade ago, I have deeply regretted my lack of expertise and the obscurity of my name. However, I have strived to uphold professional ethics and have never dared to waver in my commitment. I have no grand theories about morality; it is simply the innate goodness that everyone possesses, allowing one to act with a clear conscience. I write this to encourage myself and to share it with my fellow medical professionals.</p>

<h3>Stomach Ailments (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhuang Weizhong</p>
<p>In addition to the aforementioned common type of chronic gastritis, there is also chronic gastritis caused by syphilis or tuberculosis, which will be discussed in detail later.</p>
<p>Gastritis is an organic disease with corresponding pathological changes, which are beyond the scope of common knowledge. Therefore, I can only provide a general overview. In acute gastritis, the mucous membrane will definitely undergo significant changes, even affecting the deeper layers (the stomach tissue is divided into three layers: the mucous membrane, the muscle layer, and the serous membrane). These changes include erosion, which can develop into ulcers, and even perforation of the serous membrane. Glandular secretions are also affected. In chronic gastritis, there are two pathological types: atrophic and hypertrophic. All these pathological changes are closely related to clinical practice.</p>
<p>Leaving aside pathological changes, let's discuss the symptoms of gastritis. Since gastritis is divided into acute and chronic types, the symptoms, whether subjective (felt by the patient) or objective (observed by others), will differ, but there are also similarities, only varying in severity.</p>
<p>First, let's discuss the symptoms of acute gastritis. The key symptoms include severe stomach pain, vomiting, diarrhea or constipation, fever, and a thick coating on the tongue. Stomach pain is almost always present in acute gastritis, but the nature of the pain is not as specific as in ulcers. Vomiting is not always present, but in most patients with acute gastritis, the body's natural defense mechanism attempts to eliminate harmful stomach contents, or vomiting occurs as a result of stimulation reflexes caused by stomach contents. Frequent vomiting can be unbearable for the patient. Initially, the vomit consists of stomach contents, but later it may contain mucus. If there is erosion or ulceration, there may be blood in the vomit, but this is rare. After vomiting ordinary stomach contents, the patient feels refreshed. With proper treatment, vomiting can be prevented from recurring. Some patients only experience belching and nausea without vomiting. Furthermore, acute gastritis often occurs in conjunction with enteritis. When enteritis is present, diarrhea is common, but not always. Some patients with acute gastritis experience constipation. In acute gastritis, fever is usually not very high, or there may be no fever at all. However, children with the disease often have a fever of around 39 degrees Celsius. As for the thick coating on the tongue, it is almost always present in patients with acute gastritis. The patient's appetite is already reduced, and the coating on the tongue further impairs their sense of taste, making them even less inclined to eat. Acute gastritis caused by corrosive substances (i.e., toxic gastritis) causes more severe pain, and the vomit often contains blood, even vomiting blood.</p>
<p>Now, let's discuss the symptoms of chronic gastritis. Patients experience reduced appetite, indigestion, a frequent feeling of bloating in the stomach, thirst, bad breath, nausea, belching, and sometimes vomiting. The tongue may also have a coating, and the patient often suffers from constipation. These symptoms are common to all chronic stomach diseases and are not unique to the so-called common type of chronic gastritis. In general medical practice, when patients exhibit these symptoms, they are provisionally diagnosed with chronic gastritis. However, to be honest, these symptoms are merely a group of signs. In addition to tentatively labeling it as "chronic gastritis," it is important to carefully examine the patient to determine the underlying cause. Purely common type of chronic gastritis without other diseases is actually rare. Scientifically speaking, the stomach may not have inflammatory changes even if these symptoms are present. Therefore, to make a definite diagnosis of "chronic gastritis," there must be sufficient evidence of inflammatory changes. It is especially important to consider past symptoms, examine stomach fluids, and assess the overall condition before making a decision. Furthermore, it should be noted that this disease is often a symptom of other diseases, and careful examination is needed to determine if there are any other underlying conditions.

<h3>The Currently Spreading Smallpox (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Nie Chuanxian</p>
<p>The causes and symptoms of smallpox in general: The cause of smallpox is a filterable virus, or it is said to be caused by a certain bacterium, but no one has been able to confirm this theory so far. The general progression of smallpox is usually divided into four stages. The first is the incubation period, which is the period from the time the virus enters the body until the onset of the disease, usually twelve to fourteen days. During this period, the patient does not feel any different. The second is the onset period, during which the patient suddenly feels chills, shivering, and a rapid rise in body temperature to 39 to 40 degrees Celsius. At the same time, severe headaches, back pain, vomiting, loss of appetite, and a flushed face occur. After three or four days, the patient enters the third stage, which is the rash stage. Initially, bright red, raised papules appear, spreading from the face to the whole body. These develop into vesicles and finally into pustules, which eventually form scabs. The fourth stage is the desquamation stage, which often leaves permanent scars, commonly known as "pockmarks."</p>
<p>The dangers of smallpox: To date, there is no effective treatment for smallpox in medicine, and the mortality rate is also not low. In children who have not been vaccinated and contract smallpox, death is very common. There are many atypical cases of smallpox, such as hemorrhagic type and confluent type, which are almost always fatal. There are also many complications during the course of the disease, such as conjunctivitis and corneal ulcers, which can lead to lifelong disability, and bronchitis, tracheitis, and pneumonia, which often become the cause of death. It is known that there have been many dangerous cases in a certain isolation hospital this year, especially the hemorrhagic type, which has been seen frequently. At the same time, there are many adult patients, which is not what we usually imagine, that smallpox infection mostly occurs in children. This should be given special attention. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Simple Disinfection Methods for the Families of Patients with Infectious Diseases (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yanggao</p>
<p>(2) Concluding Disinfection</p>
<p>Concluding disinfection is performed after the patient has recovered or died. All the patient's rooms, as well as all the equipment or items they contained, are thoroughly disinfected to ensure that all germs are eliminated and do not harm others.</p>
<p>The patient's room and nearby rooms suspected of being contaminated should be wiped with a 3% carbolic acid solution. All floors, tables, chairs, beds, benches, and all furniture in the room must be wiped very thoroughly. All crevices must also be injected with disinfectant. If the walls are whitewashed, they must be repainted. If they are bare wooden walls, they should also be wiped with dilute carbolic acid solution. After washing with disinfectant, then wash them again with hot water and soap with a brush. Clothes, bed curtains, and other cloth items can be gathered and boiled. Mattresses should be sprayed with disinfectant, such as dilute carbolic acid solution or 1% formalin solution, and then dried in the sun. Books, newspapers, paper items, toys, and other items can be burned directly. If the patient's room can be tightly closed, after the above procedures are completed, the following method can be used for disinfection to ensure thorough disinfection. The method is also very easy and inexpensive. However, before implementation, all air leaks in the room must first be sealed with paper and paste. Then, use the following gaseous disinfectant for sterilization. However, the amount of chemicals used must be determined by the size of the room. Therefore, the volume of the room must first be calculated, i.e., height multiplied by width, and then multiplied by length. For example, if a room is 4 meters high, 3 meters wide, and 6 meters long, then its volume is 72 cubic meters. The amount of chemicals required for each cubic meter is briefly described below:</p>
<p>Paraform 10.0 grams</p>
<p>Natrium bicarbonate 5.0 grams</p>
<p>Water 50.0 cc</p>
<p>Mix the above three items together and place them in a large enamel pot. Then, gradually add 25.0 grams of Kalium Permanganicum to the above liquid. However, when adding it, add it in small amounts gradually (do not pour it all in at once), otherwise, it is easy to overheat, erupt, and injure people around. Then use a wooden stick to stir evenly, put it in the room, and the people and animals in the room should leave immediately, close the doors tightly, and let it evaporate to disinfect for seven hours before opening the door. However, because the remaining gas still has an irritating effect, the windows and doors must be opened immediately to circulate the air and dissipate the gas.</p>

<h3>Avoiding Talk and Avoiding Treatment</h3>
<p>— Sangzi</p>
<p>Chinese people have a common problem, which is "avoiding talk and avoiding treatment." Therefore, all work and all diseases are buried and sacrificed under this psychology and spirit of "avoiding talk and avoiding treatment." We believe that for work to improve or progress, and for diseases to turn around or be eradicated, it is necessary to thoroughly examine and critique all aspects of work, from which we can discover the shortcomings in the work; and to carefully examine and diagnose the crux of all diseases, from which we can discover the truth of the disease; and then we can plan the development or prescribe the right medicine. But the key to this is the honest and frank confession of the worker or the patient's family. However, in general, patients' families, because of shame and disgust, have never been willing to reveal private matters, so the work can never progress, the disease can never be eliminated, and today's political pathology and physiological defects have been formed.</p>
<p>Recently, the Central Executive Committee believes that the current national affairs are difficult and dangerous, and that there are many things to be done. It is a time to taste the gall and sleep on firewood, not a time of peace and comfort. Staff members should be diligent and cautious, and do their best to serve the Party and the country. However, recently there have still been incidents of drinking and feasting, and indulging in entertainment at will. If this continues, how can we establish a career and be a role model? In order to rectify discipline, reverse the trend, and arouse the spirit of resisting aggression and building the country, a special order has been issued to all subordinates to absolutely prohibit staff members from gambling, dancing, prostitution, and other improper entertainment. This is a measure of not avoiding talk, and a necessary facility during the War of Resistance, which is worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>Gambling, dancing, prostitution, and other improper entertainment exist everywhere, but are most prevalent in Shanghai and Hong Kong; the number of staff members who commit this error is not small, and the number of ordinary people who are immersed in it is even greater. In gambling dens, people shout and gamble; in brothels, the lights are red and the wine is green; in dance halls, people embrace and dance. These things not only waste energy, but also consume foreign exchange. This is a dangerous phenomenon and a serious loss in China during the War of Resistance. We hope that after receiving this order, staff members will be alert, and that compatriots will realize the situation after seeing this news. At the same time, this spirit of not avoiding talk can be expanded and applied to general work!</p>
<h3>Talking About Women in "Tears on the Flowers"</h3>
<p>— Yu Ling</p>
<p>—Answering a Question from a Miss—</p>
<p>(1) A Joke</p>
<p>—Mr., let me tell you a joke, a joke about you.—After Miss sat down, she looked at me suspiciously, smiling shyly and reservedly.</p>
<p>—A joke? About me?</p>
<p>—Yes, in the past, there was Yu Jing, who often had scripts published in "Women's Life." After publishing in "Night Light Cup," many small newspapers listed Yu Jing in the group of female writers. Now you have written "Women's Apartment" and "Tears on the Flowers," isn't that also...</p>
<p>—Haha, a joke. Actually, I don't understand women very well. SY knows that very well...</p>
<p>She just smiled, which made me a little embarrassed!</p>
<p>(2) Please Don't Torture My Models</p>
<p>—Mr., I know you can't dance, but...</p>
<p>—But I know some respectable dancers. Their understanding and background...</p>
<p>—I heard that the dancers in your "Tears on the Flowers" are based on real models... I want to...</p>
<p>—Oh, no, Miss, please don't torture my models, because I only know them, I can't say I understand them, let alone...</p>
<p>I heard that the characters in "Women's Apartment" have models, there are really such people, and...</p>
<p>—Oh, no, Miss... "Women's Apartment" is even more a completely fictitious creation. First of all, in terms of the background, there is no such "Women's Apartment" in Shanghai at all. As for the characters, it is even more...</p>
<p>—Aren't some of the heroines very similar to our familiar friends?</p>
<p>—Oh, then it can only be said to be a coincidence. I really didn't intend to write about anyone. Mr. Lu Xun said it well, his Ah Q is not about one or two people...</p>
<p>—Yes, I have also read Mr. Lu Xun's words about Ah Q's model.</p>
<p>(3) I Sympathize with Them</p>
<p>—Mr.: Do you sympathize with the dancers in your "Tears on the Flowers"?</p>
<p>—Sympathize: How could I write about them if I didn't sympathize with them?</p>
<p>—Who do you sympathize with the most? Among the dancers...</p>
<p>—I sympathize with Mimi, and even more with Gu Xiaomei, and even Manli!</p>
<h3>The Realization of a Hope</h3>
<p>— Wu Yonggang</p>
<p>Before accepting the position of directing "Tears on the Flowers" for the Shanghai Drama Society, I hoped that the film practitioners and theater friends who remained on the isolated island should join hands more closely, cooperate and unite our spirits, and exchange and strengthen our strength. When I returned to the film studio, my personal conclusion was that the strength we had cultivated in the past seemed too weak in this stormy era of great change, although this force was constantly growing due to the needs of the battle.</p>
<p>A few months of intense life inevitably gave me a valuable lesson, and at the same time made me see clearly the weaknesses of our own that were exposed. This is an undeniable fact. The Chinese film industry is an infant that has suffered many disasters and has not developed properly. Because of its short history and poor nutrition, it is naturally quite difficult to shoulder such a heavy responsibility today, and many weaknesses are therefore exposed. This is within our expectations; but the exposure of weaknesses is also the elimination of corruption. Next, what we urgently need to address is the issue of how to replenish this incomplete and tired team.</p>
<p>This issue is not only happening in the film industry, but in any department, and so is the theater, which is closest to the film industry. Although the theater views me with unfamiliar eyes, I am very concerned and always look for opportunities to present my latent enthusiasm to the theater, because I understand that theater and film are inseparable brothers. Because of mutual assistance and cooperation, more brilliant flowers will bloom. Considering the achievements of stage actors on the screen, I feel that we need to join hands more closely, not only to encourage and urge each other, but we will inevitably be able to quickly establish a new team due to the concentration of power.</p>
<p>Therefore, I boldly and without thinking took on the role of director of "Tears on the Flowers" as my first attempt to direct a stage play. I hope to obtain research methods from learning, and I also plan to accumulate many times of learning again and again in the hope of gaining some experience. At the same time, this is also the realization of one of my hopes, which makes me very happy. However, I am also very worried, and I always doubt my ability to do the job. I know that for more important things for everyone, everyone will give me criticism and guidance.</p>
<h3>To a Friend in the Dance World</h3>
<p>— Lan Lan</p>
<p>××:</p>
<p>Although we only met once in a chance encounter, your graceful figure accompanied by your kind soul is always lingering in my heart.</p>
<p>××, please forgive me, in the past, I have never judged you and other sisters based on the views of ordinary superficial people, especially because I am a woman myself, I can clearly understand all the pain and misfortune of women living in this male-centered society, but to be honest, before I met you, I never expected that in such a dark and dirty environment, a pure white lotus like you would actually be produced, growing in the turbid mud.</p>
<p>Do you remember when you frankly told me about your touching experiences, I was also secretly wiping tears with you? ××, I want to tell you, when I was playing Mimi in "Tears on the Flowers," listening to the flowery words of a despicable man and committing suicide by taking poison, I couldn't restrain myself anymore and cried out loud!</p>
<p>The Mimi I played, no matter in personality, behavior, or thought, is not exactly the same as you, but ×× you know, her experience is exactly the same as yours.</p>
<p>Yes, as you said, in the beginning, you and the other sisters were anesthetized by "material enjoyment." Think about it, at home, you are confined to a small and dirty room, and you are beaten and scolded by your stepmother all day long, but suddenly you are in a brilliant and gorgeous stage, the music, the lights, and several times more, the guests take you to tour, or to put it more clearly, those so-called "upper class" dance customers show off their luxurious lives, cars, restaurants, hotels, department stores, and tall buildings to you with a little pride, you are anesthetized, and with the white and bright money of the "upper class" dance customers deceiving you, you are even more anesthetized, so anesthetized that you bury your chastity.</p>
<p>I understand you very well, ××, when you said that men can play with women, and women can also play with men, and use men, but then you said again that women are subject to innate restrictions, childbirth, and easy aging. You have personally seen a companion die from an abortion, and you have personally seen a companion being abandoned because her beauty faded.</p>
<p>That's right, why, being the same people, do you have to be a dancer? Why in this society are dancers played with, trampled on, and despised at the same time? ××, you quickly answered this question yourself, who destroyed your home? Who killed your father and brothers? Who forced you, forced many sisters to be dancers? Who?</p>
<p>"Tears on the Flowers" is limited by objective conditions and cannot speak freely, but if the Mimi I play can influence or awaken many sisters in the dance world to live a meaningful and valuable life, then not only will I be happy myself, I think you will also feel fortunate! Best wishes for your efforts!</p>
<h3>About "Tears on the Flowers"</h3>
<p>— Xia Xia</p>
<p>I remember it was one night, I finished rehearsing "Tears on the Flowers" and returned home, a friend came to chat with me, it was raining lightly outside, and the raindrops hitting the balcony were very clear, so we could hear them, my friend asked me: "What do you think of the script of "Tears on the Flowers"? I lowered my head and gently answered him, I think it's great."</p>
<p>Yes, I think this is a good play, no, no, I simply feel that this is not a play—it is a fact, it is a real exposure. You can see on the newspapers every day, there are too many similar things, I think—please forgive me, a person who doesn't understand art, for talking nonsense—artistic works should not be too far away from facts, especially in this great era, the closer artistic works are to facts, the richer they are in true emotion, and the higher their value is. Thinking of Du Fu (the name "Tears on the Flowers" is originally the name of a poem by Du Fu), the sage of poetry, why are his poems so worshiped? Isn't it because his poems completely grasp the real facts and are completely the outpouring of true feelings?—Please forgive me again, I don't understand poetry and literature and I'm talking nonsense.</p>
<p>There are four dancers in "Tears on the Flowers," four different types of dancers, I cry for Xiaomei, I worry for Manli, I sympathize with Mimi, and I admire Dingxiang. Although I play Dingxiang, the shadows of the other three people often revolve in my mind, and I often think in my heart, who created these unequal tragedies in the society?</p>
<p>Speaking of the script, I can't help but think of Mr. Yu Ling, this passionate playwright. I am very honored to have played many characters under his pen. Although I am not worthy and dare not say that I understand him, I can't help but admire him: I admire his emotions for the tears of the masses, and his spirit for the sweat of the masses. He often exposes those dark and ugly corners of society. He is always shouting and calling for those who are oppressed. We all know that he still has a lot of things hidden in his stomach that he hasn't said—see the preface to Tears on the Flowers—so for him, and also for ourselves, I hope that the day when he can say everything as much as possible will come soon!</p>
<h3>Fine Weather After the Rain</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Three: Gazing Upon the Remains, Recalling the Old Patriot; Opening Literacy Class, Questioning Words to the Little Teacher</p>
<p>Jin Danyun and the others escorted the two Miss He's to the hotel. The ladies insisted that the engaged couple stay for supper before allowing them to return. The hotel was quite different from the Lingcun restaurant they had visited during the day, being much more luxurious. Moreover, this was a very large hotel, complete with all sorts of amenities, as many foreigners stayed there. It had several dining rooms, including Chinese and Western restaurants. The Chinese restaurant offered dishes from all over China, prepared in various styles. The Western restaurant offered cuisine from all over the world, each with its own unique flavor. Because of this, people from all over China and the world often stayed at this hotel. Today, the two Miss He's were treating them to Western food, leading them to the Western dining room on the fourth floor. It was a large hall, easily accommodating five or six hundred people. A Western meal wasn't particularly expensive, costing only one dollar and fifty cents, and tipping was unheard of anywhere in China at the time. However, drinks were not usually included, and if one wanted to drink, it would be terribly expensive, due to the heavy taxes on alcohol. Generally, the hotel guests who ate Western food fell into several classes, ranging from one dollar per person to three and a half dollars per person. The standard meal was one dollar per person, and the dishes were quite plentiful. Only foreigners or Chinese entertaining important guests would eat the three-and-a-half-dollar meal. Today, Miss He was treating Jin Danyun to a one-and-a-half-dollar Western meal, which was already quite lavish. After they were seated, Jin Danyun asked, "Are you definitely leaving for Freedom Village tomorrow?" He Shuangyu replied, "We are definitely going tomorrow. We should have gone sooner, but because Father hasn't left yet, there are many things here that we need to help him with. My love has also written several times, asking about us, so we sent her a telegram this morning." Jin Danyun said, "In that case, what kind of transportation will you be taking tomorrow? You can take the train or the car; have you decided?" He Liyu said, "We've already inquired about it. If we take the car, we can go directly to Freedom Village without changing vehicles. If we take the train, we'll first go to Suzhou, and then to Freedom Village. From Suzhou to Freedom Village, there are cars and steamships, which is very convenient. We haven't taken the train here before, so we thought we'd take the opportunity to see the sights, so we'd like to take the train to Suzhou and then decide from there. Perhaps my love will come to Suzhou to meet us; it's hard to say. However, she's very busy, so we told her not to come." Jin Danyun said, "I see! It's a pity that I'm also limited by my duties; otherwise, I would have accompanied you to Freedom Village for a visit. But when will you be coming to Shanghai?" As she spoke, she smiled at Lin Jiancheng. (33)</p>

<p>The annual selection of the best films is considered a very important event in the United States. Therefore, as the year draws to a close, various film organizations and film magazines are all eagerly engaged in selecting the so-called "Ten Best Films." However, although the purpose of the selection is the same, the methods of selection vary. Some organizations hold their own meetings to review and select the films, while others solicit the opinions of readers and decide based on that. Here are the results of the annual meeting of the New York National Board of Review, which were published in the Motion Picture Herald magazine on December 30th of last year.</p>
<p>The method of selection used by this board is different from others. It is divided into three categories: (1) selecting ten films with purely English dialogue; (2) selecting six films with dialogue in various foreign languages; and (3) because the films selected in the above two categories may not be entirely produced in the country (the United States), selecting ten purely Hollywood films. Now, let's first look at the results of the first and third categories:</p>
<p>(A) Ten Best Films with Purely English Dialogue:</p>
<p>(1) The Citadel (MGM) — starring Robert Donat and Rosalind Russell. Not yet released.</p>
<p>(2) Snow White (RKO) — entirely cartoon.</p>
<p>(3) The Beachcomber (Paramount) — not yet released.</p>
<p>(4) To the Victor (Gaumont) — not yet released.</p>
<p>(5) College Swing (Paramount).</p>
<p>(6) Edge of the World (produced by Pax Company) — not yet released. (Note)</p>
<p>(7) Lord Jeff (MGM).</p>
<p>(8) The Dawn Patrol (Warner Bros. First National).</p>
<p>(9) South Riding (produced by London Films, distributed by United Artists) — starring Ralph Richardson and Edna Best. Not yet released.</p>
<p>(10) Test Pilot (MGM).</p>
<p>(B) Ten Best Films Produced Entirely in the United States:</p>
<p>(1) Snow White (RKO) — entirely cartoon.</p>
<p>(2) The Citadel (MGM) — not yet released.</p>
<p>(3) You Can't Take It With You (Columbia)</p>
<p>(4) Boys Town (MGM) — starring Spencer Tracy and Mickey Rooney. Not yet released.</p>
<p>(5) Marie Antoinette (MGM).</p>
<p>(6) Alexander's Ragtime Band (20th Century Fox).</p>
<p>(7) The Adventures of Robin Hood (Warner Bros. First National).</p>
<p>(8) The Hurricane (United Artists).</p>
<p>(9) In Old Chicago (20th Century Fox).</p>
<p>(10) Four Daughters (Warner Bros. First National).</p>
<p>It is quite a rare coincidence that the four blockbuster films from last year that had increased ticket prices—namely, the fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth films—are all on this honor roll.</p>
<p>As for the six best films in the second category, some are French films and some are Russian films (because the so-called "various foreign languages" actually refers to foreign films). Moreover, most of them will not be released in Shanghai, so they will be omitted. However, "Peter the Great," the Soviet blockbuster that caused a sensation when it was released at the Cathay last year, was selected as the fifth of the six best films in the second category in this election. This is worth reporting to the readers.</p>
<p>—Note—The name "Pax Company" has never been heard of; it is likely a small Hollywood company.</p>
<h3>Yu Shuyan, Wang Yaoqing, and Lin Shutian's "Asking the Woodcutter"</h3>
<h3>One Night in a Coffee Shop at the Third Public Performance of the Yilin Drama Society</h3>
<p>— Bingdu</p>
<p>The Yilin Drama Society held its third public performance on Sunday morning at the Carlton Hotel. There were three one-act plays: "Cakes and Biscuits," "New Year's Eve," and "One Night in a Coffee Shop," and the third play was the most successful.</p>
<p>"One Night in a Coffee Shop" is an early play by Mr. Tian Han, directed by Mr. Hu Xudong. This play may seem a little unrealistic in the current era of "anti-Japanese clichés," but the playwright did not write it for this era. It reflects the tragic situation of young people talking about love and the feudal environment at that time. In particular, the writing of "One Night in a Coffee Shop" was at the beginning of the budding of the drama industry, and the object of the play was indeed limited to a portion, ten times smaller than now, of young men and women. When the new idea of advocating freedom of marriage and breaking the buying and selling system flowed into this ancient society, Mr. Tian Han was very indignant, and he felt sorry for those innocent people who were sacrificed. Therefore, the daughter of a poor scholar, Bai Qiuying, ran away from home in order to pursue her own lifelong happiness and worked as a waitress in a coffee shop, earning a living with her sweat and blood. Moreover, she hoped to save money after becoming independent and go back to school to maintain her love with Qian, the son of a wealthy family. This was precisely Mr. Tian Han's ideal and a new love model that he indicated to young people. On the one hand, he also faithfully exposed Qian, a feudal and selfish waste. When the two were breaking up in the coffee shop, he said:</p>
<p>"Please forgive me, I am a weakling," "My father is a gentry official, how can I marry a coffee shop waitress as my wife, even I..." On the contrary, he humorously transformed himself into Lin Zeqi, first using Bai Qiuying's virginal, sacred, and enthusiastic passion to save such a decadent and sentimental artist, and then, conversely, using the same words of enthusiasm to persuade Bai Qiuying after she was heartbroken: "Life is a desert, and travelers need sweet springs." I was almost excited by his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The whole play had a very good effect, because of a successful script, the characters were clearly grasped, and the director and actors also made considerable efforts. This play became the most lovely one in the third performance. Although I also understand that the scope of this play is inevitably too narrow in the current situation, I would like to encourage it from the standpoint of art, in the state of a shortage of scripts.</p>

<h3>Scheduled List of Female Yue Opera Performances</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Association and the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Hometown Group Fundraising Committee jointly organized a female Yue opera performance to raise donations. This was seen in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the scheduled list of plays is explored as follows.</p>
<p>First Day (13th): Tianxiang, Dalai, and Tongshang three troupes will perform together. The daytime play is the complete "Three Scholars Compete for a Wife," performed by Yuan Xuefen, Zhao Ruihua, Li Yanfang, Ma Zhanghua, Zhu Su'e, Yao Shuijuan, Lu Fukui, Lu Shengkui, Mao Peiqing, Xiao Shuijuan, Shang Fangchen, Yuan Jinxian, Qian Miaohua, Yao Yueming, Qian Hongmao, and Liu Peizhi. The evening play is "Joining the Army and Leaving the Kiln" by Yao Shuijuan's Tianxiang troupe, "Four Pan Jinlian" by Zhao Ruihua's Tongshang troupe, "Sending the Phoenix Crown" by Ma Zhanghua's Dalai troupe, and "Three Teasings of Bai Mudan" by Yao Shuijuan, Yao Yueming, and Yuan Jinxian. The grand finale is "Meng Lijun," performed by Yuan Xuefen, Qian Miaohua, Ma Zhanghua, Fu Quanxiang, Qian Hongmao, Zhao Ruihua, Yao Yueming, Li Yanfang, Sun Miaofeng, Xing Xianglin, Yao Shuijuan, Zhu Su'e, Shang Fangchen, Yuan Jinxian, and Xing Zhuqin.</p>

<p>Looking at the playbill for both days, it is extraordinarily wonderful, and it is a joint performance of all the famous female Yue opera stars in Shanghai. It is said that the plays and the roles played were all determined by drawing lots to show impartiality. The ticket price is five yuan, and it has been promoted by the fundraising committee members, and the results are very good. It is also heard that the association will host a banquet for the six troupes at the Da Jia Li Restaurant tomorrow (8th). Such a grand event is also related to good deeds. It is hoped that all philanthropists will have a heart for their own hunger and drowning, generously donate money, and go to see it. The merits are immeasurable.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City and the Pear Garden in the Old Capital (98)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Old Tan asks Liu Hongsheng how he will die</p>
<p>Today I saw him come to listen to the opera, and I expected that he was here to "pick hair" (meaning to nitpick and find fault). At that time, someone ran backstage to tell the manager, and soon Liu the Lame arrived. He also knew that Boss Tan was in the front hall, and he thought to himself: This old stick (i.e., old thing) is here today, he must have no good intentions. Therefore, from beginning to end, he sang and acted solemnly. Old Tan listened, sometimes shaking his head, sometimes nodding, even if one or two familiar friends asked him how it was, he did not criticize. Until the end, when Yang Liulang passed away and sang "Impermanence arrives, everything ends, I will go to see my ancestors," Old Tan suddenly slapped the table and said, "I see how you will die!" After saying that, he stood up and left. Later, someone asked him what he meant by this, and he said, "Other plays can sell their voices, but this play is sung when a patient is about to die. I didn't expect that in the last sentence, he still used a high note and pulled his voice. Of course, he won't die. Logically speaking, when singing this sentence to 'everything ends,' it's like a dying person taking a breath, the air inhaled is not as much as the air exhaled, of course, the breath is weak and the voice is subtle. When singing the four words 'go to see my ancestors,' he can only read one word at a time intermittently, and there is no such thing as singing. Furthermore, all the singing and acting of dying in the play are not easy, so 'acting death' is also difficult in the work. Moreover, the circumstances of death are different. For example, 'Nantianmen' is freezing to death, 'Li Ling Tablet' is hitting to death, shooting to death, and dying from poison, all of which are rapid, and it is easier. The last sentence of 'Wupenji,' 'Go to the underworld,' can sometimes be cut off with a 'sweeping head,' and not sung down. 'Burning Mianshan' does not sing, but only acts, and there is also the help of rosin fireworks to express the work, and it does not feel difficult. Only these two plays, 'Nantianmen' and 'Hongyang Cave,' must be sung to death, and this last sentence cannot be deleted, so singing high and fast is completely inappropriate. Liu the Lame only knows how to sell his voice, but he doesn't know that this play is not fundamentally sung well with the high voice of the B tune. When we sing opera, the most important thing is that we must never learn and sing hard for plays that are not suitable. His singing of this 'Hongyang Cave' is a mistake of this unsuitable problem, so I want to ask him how he will die." This passage was later heard by Hongsheng, and he was also very impressed. From then on, he stopped singing this play.</p>
