<h3>檢討主和論</h3>
<p>某國駐華大使前自重慶來上海，或叩以在渝如何印象，據述：國民政府主持抗戰，閱時二十餘月，其艱苦慘痛，史鮮倫比，乃依然朝氣蓬勃，制勝之信念彌堅；此乃最深刻之印象，誠始料所不及云。有往淪陷區掃墓而歸上海者，質以此行如何觀感·據述：奸宄狼狽，巧取豪奪；居民悲憤欲絕，呼籲無門，故夙昔不知國家爲何物，不知法紀之可珍者，及今皆能恍然於國運與利益之不可分，曉然於抗戰圖存之不可緩，但願天日重光。此二說者，可以覘知中國朝野之意態。乃於聞此二說之同時，偶見香港方面主和報紙之論調，則允深感於人心不同之甚。請檢討之：</p>
<p>檢討是非，或以爲無絕對，然眞理決不因是非之或不絕對而磨滅。見仁見智之殊，入主出奴之辨，或儼然對立，然薰猶決不因對立而中和。况有絕對而不足以對立者！或稱主和，或稱投降；在精衛以和平運動爲號召，國民政府斥之爲圖謀不軌而令通緝；此即不足以對立者也。何也？就彼主和論調，作客觀之檢討，縱不阿附國民政府，亦得如此判斷也。彼之言曰：主張和平之眞確性，乃在難民之流離失所，淪陷區中同胞之顚連困苦，失地日多；故就目前局勢而平心靜氣以思量之，惟有主和云。又曰：和之方式有二，曰國際調停，曰直接交涉；期待國際調停者，即以國家民族之命運，委諸他人處決，故宜直接交涉云。又曰：直接交涉先以雙方之聲明或宣言，互表誠意，然後停戰議和云。彼曰：此顚撲不破之眞理也。攷其根本觀念，乃在所謂「世無不和之戰」。</p>
<p>「世無不和之戰」，此其爲準確之眞理，亦猶「世無不死之人」；若以此爲眞理而不問時機，不問條件，惟和是求，惟死是求，以貫澈此眞理，則其爲謬誤，乃人人所能體認，無待辭費。以言時機，宜無定論；然主和者方以一難民流離失所，淪陷區同胞顚連困苦，失地日多」，形容軍事之不利；夫軍事不利之際，固投降之時機，而非議和之時機也。以言條件，抗戰者目的在乎對方之放棄侵略，主和者意在放棄抗戰；彼不放棄侵略而此先放棄抗戰，以此求和，固投降之條件，而非議和之條件也。即就難民流離失所言之，要在救濟難民，豈以求和爲結論；以淪陷區同胞顚連困苦言之，要在恢復主權行政，又豈以求和爲結論；以失地日多言之，耍在規復失地，如北平南京之現狀，非所謂規復失地也。主和者其亦平心靜氣以思量之乎；居今日而謂惟有主和，其得保全領土主權行政乎？凡此數端，主和論者旣喪其眞確性，則所謂和之方式，更所不必論。循彼論之，若以國際調停之方式，爲委棄國家民族之命運於他人，則今日之日本猶以戰勝者自居，謂中國應由直接交涉之方式，而將國家民族之命運，委諸日本乎？證之以國民政府之「朝氣蓬勃，抗戰之信念彌堅」，更證之以明令緝在，可知國民政府必繼續抗戰，旣未期待國際調停，亦未準備直接交涉，而日本方面，亦屢作不以國民政府爲對手之表示。然則主和者所謂直接交涉，若非先行毀棄中國之政治組織，必無以貫澈直接交涉之主張，若非先行取得日本承認之爲對手，亦必無以使直接交涉之實現；於是言之，主和者所憧憬之前途，固未能優於北平與南京，而主和論之內容，固亦無有是處也。</p>

<h3>莫洛托夫演說的影響　倫敎航訊　受安全威脅的小國同情蘇聯英蘇談判問題尙待適當方法</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>莫洛托夫的演說，在這裏是早已十分迫切地期待着了，在牠未發表之前，英法兩國的輿論，都異口同聲地宜稱着：這一决英法的提案，如果蘇聯眞想和英法聯合的話，是萬不能再不接受的了，可是實際上，你要是和較有眼光的觀察家們討論時，他們却定會悄悄地告訴你一句「老實話」：—「蘇聯要是這樣接受的話，那才怪哩！」</p>
<p>於是，五月三十一日的晚間，莫洛托夫在莫斯科發表了他的蘇聯外交政策的演說。蘇聯並沒有接受英法的提議：可是也沒有拒絕。這麼着，在英法當局們的面前，暫時就放下了一個悶葫蘆：在蘇聯政府正式答覆送到前，英法當局們，甚至是無法決定他們下一個步驟。</p>
<p>昨今兩天英法兩國的報紙，對於這個演說，一般地說印象似乎還是樂觀的。大多數的意見，都在斷定着；蘇聯的願意與英法聯合，是毫無疑問的一個大前提；目前的問題，僅僅是條件和方法。因而莫洛托夫的演說，在他們看起來，不過是蘇聯逼緊一步的外交運用而已；其目的，在於求得更有利的交換條件。</p>
<p>演辭中，最値得注意的，是在於那個强調蘇聯的遠東政策，及公開宣佈援助中國抗戰的處所。艾登辭職後的歐洲，集體安全制是崩潰了；那以後，在這一年多的過程中，一般人的大概印象，是：如果把蘇聯外交政策的歐洲部份和遠東部份，分在天秤上兩頭的，遠東部份的那一頭，是重些的。而這决莫洛托夫的演說，就是一個有力的證據。</p>
<p>不久前，叉有一般人說過這麼一句話，那是：今天的蘇聯，與其說牠是一個歐洲的列强，還不如說牠是一個亞洲的列强，來得確些。現在聽到了莫洛托夫的演說，對於那些以爲蘇聯或許會因爲歐洲德意脅迫加緊，而放鬆了她在遠東堅强立塲的疑慮，到現在，似乎更可以一掃而光的了。</p>
<p>至於英法蘇之間合作的談判呢，當然的，還是要進行下去的。主要的原因，是由於已經進行到了目前這階段而又棄去的話，那害處，對於英法是不堪設想的；比起根本沒有這回事來，還要壞得多。而在根本上，歐洲今天的環境，決定了不得不在這時產生英法蘇之間的合作，這些，上幾决的通訊裏，已先後地指陳過了。現在要指出來的，是莫洛托夫發表演說時這大的前後一個多禮拜之內的歐洲情勢中，兩項最主要的事。</p>
<p>張伯倫內閣」外交路綫的最後掙扎</p>
<p>英國張伯倫首相，在位將近三年了。自從去年英國的內政，因外交而時受波動以來，他打算退休的消息，曾一再地傳稱過。可是，在上一個禮拜，這一個消息，却證實了出來；他已經決定在今年十一月大選，新政府成立後，明年完全退休到鄕下去，不再過問政治。不過，在他沒有退休前的這幾個月內，他還要完成兩樁事：一樁，是怎麼保持在下一個政府裏的，保守黨現在固有的地位；另一，則是怎麽「維持歐洲的和平。」這些天來，英國內部的活動和佈置，已經非常緊張。雖然屬於純內政的，在這裏無談的必要；但那內政與外交關聯著的處所，却有兩點要指出來；第一，張伯倫左右內圈的人們，都認定，祇要歐洲另有一個危機，另有一個慕尼黑式的會議，那末，保守黨的地位，在大選裹，是非常危險的；第二，阻止新危機的唯一有效方法呢，毫無疑義的，是一個可伸可縮的英，法，蘇的「抵抗侵略同盟」。這兩點意見的着眼點，還是在於內政，外交僅僅是方法。這一點，也算是道一决英，法，蘇合作談判中，英國一般素來反對親近蘇聯人士忽然改變態度的原因之一·不過，「張伯倫內閣」的目的，却並不僅限於此的，牠另外，還有牠的外交路綫。</p>
<p>「張伯倫內閣」的外交路錢是什麽呢？第一步，澈底淸算英，法與德，意間的矛盾，第二步，簽定「四强公的」，第三步，改相國聯，把蘇聯踢開去，或甚至醞釀一個反共十牢軍。這一路錢的種種夢想，到目前，即使在英國，已經早巳被人嘲笑，或甚至忘記了。不過，在張伯倫這將要下台的前夜，作爲一個迴光返照，他還想作最後一决的嘗試。</p>
<p>所以，依照近來張伯倫左右親信們的計議，大概如果這個禮拜蘇聯已經接受了英法，這一决提議的話，那末，接着而立刻開始的，並不是具體地去制裁侵略，而反是和德，意開始「調整邦交。」</p>
<p>至於調整」的方法，照目前這一般人的打算，大概是由英，法，蘇（必要的加上美國）等爲基本主動，邀的德，意，開一個國際會議，從事各種商討，在這以前，却先由英，德間舉行接洽。</p>
<p>自然，這打算着的「接洽」，萬一順利時，會隨時隨地又轉了方向，走向「四强公的」之途，重行踏上「張伯倫內閣」的老路綫的。因爲，據張伯倫的主意，在這個「接洽」裏，英國無論如何，要告訴德國，而使她相信，英國對她，絕無「進攻」的企圖，一切爲的是「防禦」；換句話說，祇要德，意不妨碍英，法的主耍利益，一切仍然是可以商量，去滿足德，意「願望」的。從這引伸下去，當然過去的侵略結果，固然可以追認，連另一些其他小國的生存，也可以在商量的對象之內。</p>
<p>這决莫洛托夫演說裏，重行强調集體安全，擁護斯太林援助一切爲自己獨立而戰的國家的原則，那用意，就是在針對着一點。在歐洲一切安全受着威脅的小國眼裏，蘇聯的聲望和信用，比起英，法的來，是成爲相反的情形，在升降着</p>
<p>德國外長里本特洛甫的新計劃</p>
<p>自從去年慕尼黑會議以後，里本特洛甫，在德國的聲望，已經非常的高了：他的對英國情形估計的正確，竟然超過了希特拉本人！希特拉自認是在一切方面超過一切人的，但對於要求割讓穌台德區的問題，還始終爲了當的顧忌英國，而躊躇着。然而，一開頭起，里本特洛甫就勸告他，不妨再走得遠一點，乾脆要求割讓，因爲英國決不曾爲此作戰，相返的，却會怕戰爭爆發，自作調人，將牠　　德國的。聽到這話的希特拉，是在猶夷着的；然而，要不了幾天，代表英政府的太晤士報，就出現了一篇社論，公然主張割讓蘇台德。那以後，關涉到英國的事件的，希特拉都要問一問這一位一英國通」。所以，本年三月裏，希特拉敢於悍然佔領捷克，也就是因爲在事前，這位里本特洛甫對於英國的可能反應，完全預先推算淸楚的緣故。這樣幾决一來，於是，在今天的德國，他的地位，已經僅决於希特拉和戈林，而成爲第三位要人了。</p>
<p>這樣一位重耍的人物，在目前希特拉爲了英，法，蘇合作談判的結果未明，而暫時沉默着的時候，他却父爲他草成了將來的擴張計劃。</p>
<p>里本特洛甫這一决提出來的新計劃，牠的具體內容，現在還不知道。不過，那大槪主旨，據已經知道的去推論，是可以這樣的分成兩部份。最重要的，是關於立論根據部份，大概有三點：　任何大規模的德國擴張計劃，必須在英國現任內閣在位時，允其「和平使者」的張伯倫未退位時，提了出來：　未來的動作，不一定像上幾决調兵遣將：　一切準備，必須在九月裏紐倫堡國社黨大會以前，使牠完成。至於具體計劃部份，仍然是不外東南歐，地中海上，以及近東一帶，而並沒有蘇聯的烏克蘭在內。</p>
<p>現在莫洛托夫的演說，已經發表了。一等近幾天內蘇聯政府正式覆文送到，大概英法就當更一進步地有所動作。看情形，談判的根本廢棄，是不會的：成爲問題的，倒是未來談判的方法以及英法制裁侵略的決心。決心是根本問題，英法這一面，不下大決心是不成的，但彼此有了決心，而沒有適當的談判方法，也還是不行的。在目前的情形下，蘇聯與英法間，在決心上，固然的還有着相當的距離；而允其在英蘇現政府彼此不信仟的情形下，用什麽方法，方可以圓滿地達成諒解任務呢？這，也是橫在目前英蘇談判上的一個很可觀的阻碍。目前，英國有一部份人士，也已經注意到這一問題，而在紛紛地討論着補救的辦法。巳經提出來的新辦法，大概有兩種最爲一班人贊同；第一，是通過第三國，而達到談判的圓滿的諒解，如土耳其就是這種第三國家之一：第二，由英法當局和蘇聯當局間，更直接地私人接觸；以這爲目標，連哈立法克斯和龐萊覓求一個與波丹金談判機會的事，現在也都被大家討論着。不過，這一切的計劃，目前還沒有成熟而且其他的新方法，也在一一地層出不窮地被提出着，所以這的還沒有到下斷論的時候。</p>

<h3>環境惡劣無法復工　綸昌工人之呼籲　語重心長寗忍飢餓之苦　保全聲譽不願供人利用　希望各界予以救濟</h3>
<p>綸昌紡織廠此决因復工受意外干涉、致發生不幸事件、英籍職員丁格勤竟遭殞命、此事已引起各方關心、茲經探悉該廠此次事件經過、爰誌如决、</p>
<p>綸昌戰後復工經過</p>
<p>綸昌紡織廠白蓮涇老廠、開辦迄今、已有十六七年之歷史、八一三事變時、該廠因遭受烽火、無法繼續工作，乃暫時宣告停工、工人亦分別遣散回鄕、民國二十穴年戰事西移、該廠乃於九月間通告籌備復工、因工人四散、至二十七年二三月始陸續有工人來廠復工、該廠方面、因受戰事影響、對於原有獎賞金每千疋無論多色少色一律十五元之規定、當即分別酌减、徐圖恢復、</p>
<p>勞資協調糾紛已了</p>
<p>比來百物昂貴、工人生活、益感艱難、該廠工入愛護該廠、向極熱心、廠方對於工友、亦頗關心、此决工人乃請求廠方增加賞金、以補米貼、勞資雙方、本互助之義、經三星期之商討、廠方乃允增加米貼十分之三、賞金增加百分之五、工人方面以廠方答復圓滿、乃決定尅日繼續工作、</p>
<p>意外阻撓無法復工</p>
<p>不料於辦法既已商妥之後、工人相率到廠復工之際、突有南碼頭僞自衛團員受人指使出而干涉、竟阻止工人上工、以致該廠四週、密布僞隊、工人無法上工、當時並有工人兩名被僞團員擊傷、直至現時爲止、該廠準備上工之工人、仍被阻止、以致風餐露宿、備嘗艱苦、惟該廠工人、意志堅決、決不受人利用、並已分函各界籲請、設法救濟、</p>
<p>工人來函備述痛苦</p>
<p>申報編輯先生公鑒、茲啟者、事因貴報前日登載綸昌老廠復工一事內中罷工情形、未能明瞭一切、故此工人等今將一切情形、報告各界同胞、以明眞相、本廠自開辦至今、巳有十六七年之久、向來就印花　一部而言、別間不能盡述、原有獎賞金每千疋計算、無論多色少色、一律增加十五元之賞金、以至八一三、我國遭受侵略、</p>
<p>戰事發生</p>
<p>廠方無法開工、停止工作、工人造散、各回鄕避難、苦不堪言、只到民國二十六年上海戰事西移、浦東地方、稍見平靜、是年九月間、廠方有見及此、當即登報、招集各部工人、以備開工、當時因工人逃難各鄕、未能全廠開工、至二十七年春二三月、方有就近工人來廠復工、廠方於此時、將</p>
<p>賞金減少</p>
<p>以多色少色計算、以多色减至每千疋十元零五角計算、少色减至五元二角五分計算、照此數計算、已經减了半數有餘、工人等抗戰期中、各地人民、逃來上海、生活無法維持、只得忍痛承受、但以不能維持生活、不得已只得要求廠方增加賞金、以補米貼、談判三星期之久、方得廠方允許、</p>
<p>增加米貼</p>
<p>十分之三、賞金增加百分之五、工人等以爲答復圓滿、允許復工、不料是日復工、竟有南碼頭僞自衛團團員受某方指使、出而干涉、阻止工人上工、又有日軍在塲保護、仍是無效、以至每日淸晨五六點鐘、廠之四週、僞隊佈滿、壓迫工人無法上工、並擊傷工人兩名、又有衝進廠內之種種在言、工人等</p>
<p>手無寸鐵</p>
<p>廠方亦是無法保障、故工人等只得出廠、忍受暗無天日慘痛、飢餓之苦、懇求各界慈善人士大發慈悲、以設法救濟數百工人生命、勝造七級浮屠、工人等再生、當效犬馬之勞、是為盼切、工人等寗受飢餓之苦、不受賣身吶喊工具之財、以保全我中華民族之聲譽而已、以上各節、俱是實情、白蓮涇綸昌老廠全體工人叩請、</p>
<h3>日使館參事　森島返滬</h3>
<p>日使館參事森島、曾於週前爲向其本國政府有所報告、離滬返日、頃悉森島以任務已畢、復於昨日匆匆由日返滬、</p>
<h3>浦南渡輪停航</h3>
<p>浦南連日情形頗爲不安、據傳日軍在各渡口搜查、白蓮涇六里橋各渡口渡輪、咋日起又告停航、</p>
<h3>英向日抗議　牒文之內容　要求內容分為六款　請日當局予以注意</h3>
<p>大陸報云、昨（十日）悉英總領事斐利溥星期五日正式致牒日總領事三浦、證實斐氏星期三日所作之口頭交涉、牒文言及浦東白蓮涇綸昌印花廠鄰近有持械便衣日人數隊、對於罷工解決後希望復工之華工加以恫嚇、並向出廠鼓勵工人返廠之綸昌英籍職員兩人開槍射擊、致印花廠迫不得已暫行封閉、該</p>
<p>書面抗議</p>
<p>要求　遏制持械煽動者活動於印花廠附近、　日兵全力保護仍居印花廠與陸家嘴紡織廠中之英籍職員、　遏止陸家嘴紡織廠附近之煽動者、　遏止目前廣泛之反英煽動與宣傳、　防杜浦東之反英游行、與張貼反英性質之巨榜、暨分發</p>
<p>同樣性質</p>
<p>之印刷物、　遏止一大民會」等反英團體、其特饒興趣者、爲牒文中首次爰引日方控制下新申報之鼓動反英、正式請日當局加以注意、牒文中言及新申報上星期三日所刊一文、並指責該文實係鼓動破壞英國利益、該文適於釀成丁格勒慘案之翌日刊出、英總領事署認爲</p>
<p>尤屬不幸</p>
<p>英當局已作遏制此間英商華字報紙反日宣傳之努力、請三沛對於新巾報亦取相類行動、按新申報所刋　文稱英人來華有强盜之野心彼等旨在榨取工資、以實　　、又稱、綸昌紡織廠罷工不能解決、妥協即完全毀滅之謂、籲請工人追隨一力二七年廣州工人批翻在華英帝國主義之精神、</p>
<h3>受外匯緊縮影響　各業紛紛漲價　影響社會生活殊非淺鮮</h3>
<p>自外滙劇變後、洋貨輸華價格、益見增高、各業爲成本關係、多紛紛漲價、昨汽車出租業，製革業·螺旋釘業·均通告增價、茲分錄如下、</p>
<p>出租汽車增加車費</p>
<p>上海市出租汽車業爲增加車費事通告云、茲因外滙暴縮、汽油及車胎零件等項、價格飛漲、敝會各會員勢難支持、爰於六月十二日零點起（即十一夜十二時後）增加租車費、每二十分鐘起碼收取國幣一元四角、每小時四元二角、以資挹注、但所增加之數，尙不足以維持、因特登報敬告各界、諸希鑒原</p>
<p>製革同業通吿漲價</p>
<p>製革業同業公會通告云、茲因外滙劇變、原料高漲、兼之生皮來源稀少、若非亟圖漲價、殊難維持成本、現由同業聯合公議、自本日起、重磅底皮、每市斤定價法幣一元八角五分、中輕磅底皮每市斤定價法幣一元八角、恐未週知、用特通告、惟希公鑒、</p>
<p>螺旋釘加價二成半</p>
<p>民國螺旋釘公司公告云、邇以滙率驟緊、原　奇貴、敝廠出品之塔牌螺旋釘、批售價目、即日起按照價目單、增加二成半、（即百分之二十五）事非得已、詰希鑒諒、又五金業及五金零件業均議決增價、五金百分之三十、零件百分之二十、此外洋紙·火油·顏料·呢絨·疋頭·菸草·煤·糖等業、均亦先後增價、惟不一律、</p>
<p>無綫電材料亦增漲</p>
<p>本市無綫電材料所售之眞空管、以及裝置無綫電各項零件、除少數由廠方自製外、大部份均仰給美荷等國運來、近因外滙突變、成本增加、該同業等祇得增加售價、故日來此項眞空管及零件售價均漲起二三分鈿出售、以資維持血本、</p>
<h3>法大使夫人　由巴黎來滬　女公子兩人同來</h3>

<h3>日人在蘇州河南　又逮捕華人　於開釋時始通知捕房　因海洛因案拘往訊問</h3>
<p>大陸報云便衣日人兩名、未通知公共租界警務處、昨日（十日）午前、復在蘇州河南岸南京路外難捕人、旋決定開釋所捕華人時、始行知照公共租界當局、被捕者係華籍經紀人陳鳳山、（譯音）甫下其汽車時、即有兩便衣日人到塲、攫之曳入該兩日人之汽車中、駛越外白渡橋而入虹口、昨日午後、日人偕該經紀人入中央捕房、將其人交公共租界當局、日人語警方稱、彼等因欲向陳質訊關於販賣海洛因事故將其逮捕、日方疑其從事海洛因買賣、但所疑已證實無稽、故決將其人交公共租界警方云、陳旋經警務處釋出、</p>

<h3>外匯市價調整後　土貨輸出可望激增　西南各關管理成功變為出超　滬津各關入超此後或能减少</h3>
<p>中國政府調整外滬市價之後、上海線　市場外匯、雖告緊縮、但有益於中國國際收支、减少無益洋貨進口、消除入超、鼓勵輸出、惟外匯平準委員會、決以全力維持外匯之穩定、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>西南出超陷關入超竭力設法消除各關入超之後、今西南蒙自。思茅。騰越·龍州·北海男·瓊州·雷州·江門·以及溫州·汕頭、均已成爲出超之海關、惟淪陷區域各關、依然入超、且數字益見增加、允以上海·天津·膠州·烟台·秦皇島·厦門等關爲最多、如今年一月至四月、天津入超七千四百三十萬零七千元、上海入超七千二百三十一萬穴千元、膠州入超一千四百九十五萬一千元、烟台入超五百寓零零九千元、</p>
<p>四月入超創新紀錄關於全國對外貿易、當戰事初起之時、即民國二十六年九月至十二月、逐月均由入超改　為出超、叫個月共出超五千三百六十二萬七千元、二十七年六月至九月、逐月亦爲出超、四個月共出超二千零六十三萬八千元、惟自去年十月起、至今年四月止、均爲入超、總共入超一萬五千六百二十四萬二千元、允以今年之四月份創戰後之入超最高新紀錄、計五千六百五十四萬一千元、</p>
<p>洋貨進口價值驚人進口之洋貨、以今年一月至四月而言、第一爲雜糧及雜糧粉、値五千九百十九萬六千元、第二爲燭皂·油脂·蠟膠·松香、値四干二百一十四萬六千元、第三爲棉花·棉紗·棉綫、値四千零三十九萬元、第四爲雜貨、値二千二百四十一萬三千元、第五為金　及　砂值二千零六十五萬八千元、比較去年同期、除雜貨及金屬及礦砂减少外、棉花·棉紗·棉綫·一項、竟增加三千七百四十二萬七千元、</p>
<p>調整外滙鼓勵輸出自中國政府調整外滙市價、以及英商匯豐等銀行、限制供給黑市外匯後、上海黑市外匯緊縮、能使無益之洋貨、减少進口、及滬津各關之入超、自然消除、中國主耍土貨之輸出、得以增加、政府對於桐油。藥材·礦砂·蠶絲·棉花·等貨、除努力增加生產外、並指定貿易委員會等負責統制、集中香港等處出口、其結售外滙之土貨出口、除免征出口稅轉口稅外、並由中央信託局代保各險、</p>
<p>平準委會負責維持外匯平準基金委員會對於上海黑市塲之外匯、決以全力繼續維持、務使價格達到水平綫、同時英商匯豐銀行與該委員會通力合作、共同穩定上梅黑市塲之匯價、對正當需要之進口商、購買外匯、仍予儘量供給、其他麥加利。花旗。等銀行、亦探取同樣之行動、所以上海黑市之匯價、已告穩定、不致冉行暴縮、而中央銀行之法定外匯價格、始終如一、並無</p>
<h3>外滙交易頗少　今晨當稍活動　汽油價格已有稍見增漲　外國報章雜誌亦加價</h3>
<p>大陸報云，上海滙市、昨日（十日）全晨雖不活躍、但午刻收盤頗穩定、時滙豐銀行按照英匯六便士五三一二五、開始以外匯售予本埠各銀行、是項滙率、較各管理銀行維持至星期六日收盤前數分鐘之六便士五。高三一二五、此是吾中英平準基金正作</p>
<p>穩定市場的努力之意、昨晚本埠銀行家與經紀人亦不明瞭、關於此點、旣不能自上海各管理銀行獲得消息、故公衆與本埠金融界須待至星期一日、始得見此後之變化也、昨晨外滙頗少交易、若干活動、固屬必有、各管理銀行以六便士五出售外滙、至將近午刻收盤爲止、各銀行　績以</p>
<p>少量英鎊美元售予顧客、雖日方有未履行之成單、但經紀界無鉅額交易、昨日各種入口商與商人出售貨物、頗多漲價者、致匕海之生活程度、繼續增高、本埠中要油公司人員星期五日曾　、目前不擬漲價、但汽油每介侖已自一元四角而增至一元五角、自匯兌開始暴跌以來、進口</p>
<p>雜誌報紙價値已高漲百分之三十五至五十、又昨據宜露、按照現有地皮章程、規定工部局於緊急時有權採取其認爲適宜之行動、以「維持和平與秩序」、故局方有統制食物價格之權、昨晚聞諸可靠方面、目前之價格暴漲、工部局認爲尙非緊急、</p>

<p>本市節的運動委員會、前因滬西賭窟、爲害社會、曾通告全市市民、勿爲所迷、茲則鑒於賭風、較前更形猖獗、貽害正不知伊於胡底、昨特再發告市民書、致剴切之忠告、語重心長、亟爲照錄如下、竊上海自淪爲孤島以後、滬西越界築路地段、在日僞包庇之下、賭窟林立、賭風大熾、搖攤輪盤、觸目皆是、美其名曰「某某俱樂部」、實則</p>

<h3>租船加入日商組織　船主訴請還船　魚行主人租船頼　庭諭雙方試行和解</h3>
<p>住居法租界敏體尼蔭路同　里四十四號之本地人韓福南、（年四十九歲）在八一三前、曾購置輪船一艘、專航內河各地、自國軍西撤後、即離滬停泊於天生港、直至去年二月間、由開設小東門街瞿長順魚行之本地人瞿頌淸（年四十四歲）、及其叔父瞿九皋、挽出該船船老大蔡菊明、向韓承租、以作</p>
<p>運裝鮮魚</p>
<p>之用、當時除訂立合同外、並將船舶上應有之各項證件、分別交由瞿頌淸點收、並由瞿出立收據、嗣因租期三個月期滿後瞿之叔父、無意繼續、當將合同銷毀、但瞿頌淸個人、仍欲續租、遂不用瞿長順魚行名義、而由瞿另串出無錫人劉梧齋者、出面續租、其本人則居於保證人地位、因此</p>
<p>另立合同</p>
<p>續展兩月、故對於租船及其應有一切附件、亦未由瞿交還後、再行交付、藉省手續、詎料於二十七年七月十七日期滿後瞿竟將該船估價作股、技自加人日人所辦之『海內河輪船公司』、船名改爲『宜興丸』、事被船牛韓福南得悉、當委律師致函責問並催令還船、而瞿亦置若罔聞、故韓忍無可忍、爰延鄔鵬律師代理、具狀特二法院民庭、對劉梧齋瞿頌淸嚴珊洲等、提起</p>
<p>交還租船</p>
<p>賠價船價總計一萬九千二百元之訴、同時並聲請假執行，初審結果、判決原告之訴均駁回、韓奉判後、心不甘服、仍委鄔律師代理、向高三分院上訴、前日由童推事開庭傳訊、雙方均由律師代到、上訴代理人陳述不服原判及上訴理由、計四點、（一）初審對造所延之應時律師、係曾任地方法院院長、本案承審推事、係其舊屬、對於處斷本案、未免</p>
<p>有欠公允</p>
<p>（二）被上訢人將船加入日商經營之公司、反誣係屬上訴人方面自願、試問於二十七年七月二十三日、上訴人曾委由本律師去函責問、爲何未予駁覆反挽其友人王志良前來洽商調解、三謂該船旣已收回、何以合同保單、尙在上訴人之手、即退一步言之假上訴人當時未能檢出交還、應出立收據，以淸手續、（四）現檢出日商『上海內河輪船公司』華經理潘三省致瞿頌淸函內、述及將船已作股、訂立</p>
<p>合同期間</p>
<p>竟載『昭和、十三年三月十五日』等字樣、可見瞿頌淸早巳心懷叵測、串通潘某、依賴勢力、藉圖吞沒租船、旋由被上訴人代理律師唐瑛答辯各點、並請在下届續訊時、票傳日商『內河輪船公司』負責人潘三省到案作證、至此上訴代理人即起立表示反對、謂瞿與潘係同一聲氣、故庭上亦未予置理、遂即訊之證人蔡菊明（即　船老大）、供稱、該船停泊天生港時、係在日軍</p>
<p>封銷綫內</p>
<p>當時由瞿小開前來、與本人接洽、謂渠與日方熟悉、可負責拖出、惟須租與彼之魚行使用故遂介紹與船主、訂立租船合同、仍由本人充船老大、嗣後山日商將船拖去、係由瞿小開應許的、事後本人薪工、亦由瞿囑向該公司領取、瞿個人亦每天至該公司、惟本人雖屬鄕愚不願繼續服務、現已辭退、以上所說、都是實話我們吃船上飯不可說假話的、繼訊之證人王志良供稱、雙方都係朋友、自該船被</p>
<p>日人拖去</p>
<p>後、本人即出任調解、瞿頌淸先生係一大商家、此事完全做錯、但知利欲　心、竟謬然加入日商、設當時交還、亦不致興訟、最近聞得日商、『內河輪船公司』很是賺錢、據本人觀測、本案易於和解、將來本人仍願出仟調解等語、庭上核詞諭知雙方出外試行和解、改期再訊、</p>

<h3>外匯黑牌的前途</h3>
<p>— 鮑樂蒂</p>
<p>自動掛縮非被迫暴縮</p>
<p>現在冉也沒有比外匯黑牌的劇變，令人更驚心動魄的事了。但從道次劇變的經過看；起因顯然純由匯豐銀行自動掛縮滙價，乃至自動停止給售外滙。與被迫暴縮的情形，有主客之分，絕對不同。滙豐雖是英商銀行，因爲他是中英滙兌平準基金管理委員會的主要角色，所以無形中儼然做了中國財政部在外滙黑市塲上的代表人。他的這種舉動，是出於財部的授意，奉令而行。天下決無自己打擊自己之理。只憑普通常識來判斷，便知這决滙市激落，乃是中國政府對於管理外滙上的政策之變更，與法幣本身的安全絲毫無涉。</p>
<p>市場上幾種可笑的猜測</p>
<p>但當匯豐於七日晨初次掛縮對英匯價從八便士到七便七五後，市塲上便謠諑紛紜，流言四起。有的從政治上穿聲附會，惡意中傷，甚至謂這是歐美開始强制調停中日戰事的一種手段。有的從平準基金上妄加猜測，造謠破壞，甚至謂中國的外滙基金，經長期的貿易入超，與日僞的套買，已損失過半云云。有的放言中國政府已決定變更統制外匯的政策，實行貶抑幣値，甚至將供給外匯的機關，從上海搬到香港。叉因爲各方亟待財政部發表這决匯市劇變的善後辦法，而財部方面始終沉默，在過去二天半內並未透露絲毫意見，所以更令人疑神疑鬼，擔愁着法幣的本身是否將發生問題。外加上海流通界的銅輔幣積漸收縮，公用車輛公司方面又明白透露銅幣短少的消息。加强了各方窖藏銅幣的心理，甚而使用到各種代用貨以至用郵花印花找兌。更使人對於法幣的前途，不勝其杞憂。發行劃條，收縮五元十元法幣的風聲，又乘機復起。</p>
<p>財部發言人的聲明</p>
<p>直到現在，財政部方面對於外滙黑市塲的善後辦法，雖則尚無正式的令文發表。但財部發言人在十日那天答復新聞記者的問話時，已把上述的那些疑雲，一掃而空。並且從這决答問的內容上，從這决發生風潮的是黑市塲的非法性質上，可却財部也未必冉會有什麼正式的令文發表。</p>
<p>財部發言人在答問裹，正式指明這决滙豐的掛縮牌價和限售外匯，是先經財部的核准。同時又切實重申維持法幣的決心，並表明當局管理外匯今後的方針，該員的說明共分五點，大旨是；</p>
<p>（一）維持法幣，爲中國政府旣定政策，最近外滙平衡基金管理委員會對於調整外滙市價所運用之方法，旣未變更，政府之政策，亦係政府核准之措置。</p>
<p>（二）因進出口季節關係，目前進口增多，尤以非必需品之輸入爲甚，故調整外滙市價，以使之合於中國經濟有利之標準，維持國際收支平衡，庶更能鞏固外滙市况。</p>
<p>（三）政府維持法幣法價，抗戰前後，始終未變，自管理外滙以還，公私機關正當需要外滙，經財部核准者，均由中央銀行按照法價售給，事實昭著，至市價與法價發生差異，外滙旣經管理，此種現象，不特中國爲然。</p>
<p>（四）政府爲减少市面波動‘迭經飭由銀行維持，成績頗佳，迨外滙平衡基金委員會成立後，瞥埋機關，更臻完善，維持實力，尤見增加。</p>
<p>（五）邇來政府更力謀减少非必需品之進口，並多方設法鼓勵出口，同時節省外匯用途，冀以裨益中國之經濟而適應抗戰之需要，而平衡基金管理委員會之實力，儘足穩定市况，余固深信各方對於法幣之信心，更能增潗，絕不致因目前市面之波動而受影響也。</p>
<p>從中透露出來的消息</p>
<p>這個聲明的措詞，無可諱言的是相當暖昧的。雖則如此，但吾人至少已可從中發現出當局對於外匯統制上的積極見解。</p>
<p>不待言：當局的旣定政策是決不變更，這使是確立並維持一個適合於國家經濟，並能作爲合法貿易基礎的幣制。截至四月六日止：我國的外滙政策，顯然採取二元制度，也可以說是採取雙軌制度。這就是一方山中央銀行的操作，維持着一先令二　　滙率，俾政府所認爲合法的進口，不受匯率變動上的影響發生不利。凡經申請核准的進口，始終由中央銀行依一先令二便士的法價給售以外滙。但另一方面：由外滙平準基金管理委員會的操作，維持着外匯黑市塲上對英八便士的黑牌價。這種作用，顯有三端：一是防止投機份子利用外滙黑市塲來掀風作浪；一是俾不獲中央核准的各種决要進口，也不致受外滙黑市塲上的不斷波動而遭受更大的損失。三是認爲低於法定率在四成以上的這個黑牌滙率，至少已可無形中限制種種不必要的進口。總括一句話：這個二元制是在以貴於黑牌價四成以上的法定滙率，來維持合法的進口貿易，保護合法的進口貿易。同時以遠低於法定率四成以下的黑牌滙率，來限制無利於中國戰時經濟的進口，並從穩定這黑市塲來穩定法幣的對外信用。</p>
<p>這種二元的外滙統制方式，顯然並未經這决的變動而變動。換句話說：中央銀行將依舊維持着法定滙率，並繼續對核准的進口商給以外匯。而外滙平準基金管理委員會仍將繼續在黑市塲上操作，藉以穩定黑市塲上滙價。不過對於黑牌滙率，是否尚按四月六日止的水準加以穩定？已在重行考慮之中。而且考慮中的黑牌匯價，希望其能在足以無形限制不必要進口的水準上安定下來。</p>
<p>八便士與進出口貿易</p>
<p>外滙平準基金管理委員會沒有成立之前，上海外匯黑市場上，穩定於八便士的水準，已達九個多月。當時並無平衡機關的存在，當然沒有平衡的操作關係，這八便士的黑市率之出現，及其穩定，完全出於偶然之間，理論上是絲毫沒有任何根據的。</p>
<p>外滙平準基金管理委員會成立，並就這八便士的黑滙率，當做平衡操作的標準。除了假定其與貨幣購買力平價之外，也根本沒有絲毫理由的。但如前所述：外滙平準基金管理委員會的使命，除了杜絕投機活動的减免不獲中央核准的决耍的進口滙兌損失之外，還有藉以限制種種不必要的進口，促進土產的出口。</p>
<p>可是依最近進口貿易激增的趨勢來說：這個低於法定滙率的八便士黑牌滙價，顯已無力拘束一般的進口貿易，尤其像上海一地：本年首四個月的進口値達一億八千五百七十萬元，較去年同時的六千八百七十萬元，幾增二倍，而佔全國進口總値四六。八％之鉅。</p>
<p>然而與貶値又完全不同</p>
<p>當去歲統制外滙以後，黑市場上的匯率，激劇的距離了法價而下落的時期，以至於黑牌匯價自然穩定於對英八便士的水準之後；在國內學術界方面，頗有主張把法價也相當貶低的人。主張貶抑法價的理由：不外乎限制進口，與保護內地的出口，以至於促進出口，甚至於吸引華僑的匯款歸國爲最有力。然政府當局，除了堅決維持法幣的對外信用，絕不願對此有所舉動之外，同時在共他方面，事實上也已進行着種種達成上述目的的手段，並已取得了非常的成效。比如進口商購買外匯，只有極少數能够照法定價購，大部分皆在黑市塲上以高價購致，無形中已限制了進口。同時內地的運輸工具，大部分都操於國家的手中，國家對於進口貨，自然已依需要與否及其需要程度，而加以選擇。次要的以至不必要的進口貨，在運輸上也已受到嚴格的限制。至於從海外購買軍火，則大部份已實行以貨易貨的手段。彼此貨物價格的決定，用不着再用貶値政策來操縱。從而也並不再會影響到出口貿易的發展。至於華僑的匯款歸國，僅就共愛國心的發揚上已頗有收獲，而暗盤的存在事實上也够華僑的選擇了。</p>
<p>在這種種事實之前，政府旣沒有貶抑法價的必要，那末這决核准匯豐銀行掛縮黑牌匯價，常然和貶値的政策，完全不同。並且我們從上錄的財政部發言人的聲明之中第二條的內容來看：還可以獲得一個相反的明證。</p>
<p>如前所述：目前因爲季節關係，所以進口頗多，尤其非必需品的進口增加更甚。所以有根據有利於中國經濟的標準上，來調整外匯市價，維持國際的收支平衡。這裏經然透露出今後平準黑牌價的水準，在方法上和過去已有相當的不同。</p>
<p>（一）中央銀行始終維持着一先令二便士的法價，固然決不變更。但外匯平準委員會對於黑市塲上的平準操作，將放棄過去凍結於某一點（像釘住八便士者然）的政策，而將依有利於中國經濟的標準，並參酌進出口的季節關係，而隨機應變，因事制宜了。</p>
<p>（二）平準的標準，雖將因事制宜，他必以是否有利於中國經濟？作爲選擇標準的原則。這顯和過去的釘住政策，充全不同。因此今後出現的新水準，決非一成不變的水準。能够比八便士小，也能够比八便士大。</p>
<p>粉碎日僞套買的陰謀</p>
<p>雖都知道：日本靠濫發不兌現紙幣來掠取中國淪陷區內的原料和土產，除了把一部份運赴本國供給他工廠消費之外，同時也把不必要的另一部份，轉售於上海及中國其他各地，從而吸收法幣，以資套買外匯。不消說：他的這種計謀，必需以黑市塲的無限制供給為先決條件，同時又必幣有穩定着的黑牌匯率時可擭得充分的利益。尤其在近月來日圓對法幣激急跌値的塲合，同時法幣的黑牌滙率又長期穩定之中，他套買法幣外滙的必要及其利益，更來得鉅大。據最近報載：他現正用這種手段，在上海代他工廠向海外購買大宗棉麥：但因此决外滙暗市的掛縮，以致無法進口。由此可知這决的劇變，實與「抗戰國策」完全配合着的。</p>
<p>不過，僅僅從伸縮着黑牌滙率，來打擊日僞套買法幣外滙的陰謀，事實上是絕對不够。除非同時也能設法限制暗市塲上的外滙供給才行。雖則在滙市劇變之中，也曾一度喧傳有「將外滙供給的地點，從上海移至香港」之說，但從財部發言人的聲明裏，絕無這種表示。這雖是一大遺憾，但適足以反映政府當局體念在滬中外商人的方便，以及於反映中國外滙基金的實力之雄厚。</p>
<h3>法幣匯兌的新措施</h3>
<p>— 龔家麟</p>
<p>本月七日晨香港中英滙兌平準基余委員會電滬暫停出售外匯以來，上海匯市掀起了巨大的風波：兩天的工夫，就從八辨士二五跌到了六辨士半。市塲上五金洋貨價格抬高，而金價也受投機操縱，在漲不已。社會人心，對於法幣雖仍終保持信任，但一般見識較差者，難免受謠諑聳動，而露慌張之態。財政部對於此事，雖尚未有正式命令發表此項措置的詳細辦法，但薈集各方消息並依我人推測，政府似已決心穩定新匯率於六辨士半左右，俾使其適應於國際的收支平衡，並對此後公開市塲上外匯的供給，施以適當的限制。現在且將社會上對此新措置易生誤會之點作一闡明，並將其意義述之於後。</p>
<p>（一）政府變更匯率平準並非放棄維</p>
<p>持法幣匯價政策</p>
<p>我們首先要對大家指明，政府的支持市場法幣滙價，並非自本年三月間中英滙兌平準基金設立始；所以這次平準基金會的暫行停止供給外滙，決不是說政府此後將置市塲滙價於不顧。我們知道，政府在去年三月間施行外滙請核法時，便以漸减的核准額來緩和匯價的跌落，六月中旬以後，政府更與滙豐銀行合力維持滙價在八辨士以上的標準，以消殺投機的勢力。此項滙率，一直維持了十來個月的長久。到今年三月，爲加强滙率穩定運用的機構起見，遂與英國成立外匯平準基金，以置滙牽穩定於更堅强的基礎。不過我們須明白，設立此項滙兌平準基金以穩定滙價的政策，正好像我國抗戰的基本軍略一樣，並不是應當不惜任何代價去堅守任何地方的。政府斟酌市塲情形爲權宜的措置，非但是正當的。而且是必要的。今日政府鑒於非必需進口的突增而貶低黑市滙價以調整貿易，以後也許會因爲國際經濟情勢的　動而復提高滙價，這是同樣的可能，同樣的正當。</p>
<p>（二）政府此舉是自動的，積極的。</p>
<p>一個國家對於匯市的干涉，可分積極的與消極的兩種，中國政府現在穩定黑市滙價於新標準，係採取先發制人的積極手段。這就是說，此項新措施決非因外滙資金枯竭而被迫停售，乃是爲防患未然而加强準備。我們有幾個很有力的根據：</p>
<p>（一）自三月中旬匯兌平準基金設立以來迄本月初，總共還只不過兩個半月，就是依最極端的估計，一千萬鎊的平準基金至少也能維持八辨士的匯價在一年半載以上，決沒有兩個牛月就用光的道理。况且政府現在由出口統制所得的外滙，已有很可觀的數目，自可用以隨時補充，使滙兌基金益臻鞏固。</p>
<p>（二）南北兩種僞券雖想竭力套取外匯，但據外人可靠的估計「聯銀券」發行一年以來所調取到的法幣尚不及華北法幣流通額的十分之一（即約三千萬元），「華興券」發行以來，因爲流通上的阻礙，尚僅二十餘萬元。所以在這兩個半月內僞幣對於法幣外滙的壓力，亦不甚大。</p>
<p>（三）中國政府的在外存款與現金銀準備極充足，又不時有借款與僑民匯款來充實，開戰以後，只有增加，沒有减少，如果必要的話，儘可運用一部份來維持八辨士一五的匯率，這是輕而易舉的事。</p>
<p>（四）民國二十四年法幣政策施行以來，英美政府即竭力予中國以協助。法幣的穩定，是英美在華保有重大投資權益者莫大的利益，如果法幣不能保持穩定，他們焉有不加支持之理。顯見此舉爲中國與關係方面愼密商討的結果，完全是有計劃的積極的政策。</p>
<p>（三）新措施的意義</p>
<p>在管理通貨制之下，一國貨幣對外匯率原非一成不變。苟一項匯率已不適國情，則維持非特無益，抑且有害，尤其是在淪陷區經濟中心的上海，政府在政治上已失其管轄的能力，無限制供給黑市外匯，確有値得考慮的餘地。道種意見，我們早就說過；到最近僞「華興銀行」成立，又圖用華北「聯銀」的故技，在華中以僞鈔調換法幣套取外匯，更使我們覺得政府對外匯有作進一步統制的必要（見拙著「華興銀行的發行政策及其前途」）。現聞政府擬調幣匯價並規定以後正當商人因無法向中央銀行申請法定外匯得憑定貨單向外商銀行無限制購取外匯，此舉正合我人之意。分析起來，至少具有下列四點價値。</p>
<p>（一）調整貿易　近月來中國各　商口岸的貿易，有一點頗堪注意，就是政府統轄各口岸均有出超，而淪陷區各大商埠則因政府權力不及，致有巨額的入超。這種分劃是很明顯的：依據海關統計數字，本年首季政府統治主要各口岸計蒙自出超八、一二一千元，環州出超二八五千元，雷州出超二、四四八千元，汕頭出超五、〇三八千元，溫州出超四、〇三二千元，合計此五處出超約二千萬元；但淪陷區單　津兩埠，入超即達九千餘萬元。此種現象，政府雖不能以直接的方法加以校正，但在市塲上暫時撤消外滙平準基金的支持，然後再覓一適富的滙率以穩定之，實在不失爲一個聰明的辦法。在今日淪陷區政府不能用政治的力量以統制貿易，這恐怕也就是唯一有效的辦法。</p>
<p>（二）减少日貨進口日本鑒於日金準備的漸趨枯竭，爲吸收外滙計，將一部剩餘商品（即不能以善價在海外推銷者）竭力向中國淪陷區推銷。但他們並不願意收回在華的日圓與軍用票，於是以此等鈔券換取法幣，再調外滙。最近華北的出口統制限定某幾項土貨輸出以外幣結價，也就是這個道理。剩餘商品推銷的結果，是日貨輸華的激增：本年首季達七千數百萬元之巨，高踞各國輸華數値之首位。這巨額輸入的法幣準備，便都被日人吸取去了。如兌平準會均於法幣購買外匯予以限制，則日本對華的輸出勢將得不到外滙（指美元英鎊之類，），或將以更大的代價換成外滙，那末日貨輸華，無形中目可减少。</p>
<p>（三）防止僞幣套取外滙上月中旬華中僞「華興銀行」的成立發鈔，無疑的也是這次新措置要因之一。我們記得去年華北「聯銀」成立時，政府即施行外滙請核法，那末這次—華興—成立政府再度强化統制，也就無足驚異了。一華興銀行」鈔券現在的流通額雖尚有限，但我們有種種的理由，推測華興券一未來必趨膨脹，爲防患於未然起見，劉於以僞券吸收法幣套取外滙的故伎，目有預加防範的必要。</p>
<p>（四）使日僞計劃中的華中出口統制變爲無意義現在淪陷區的出口，是黑市外滙主要供給之一，若僞組織果出於統制出口外滙之途（能吾辦到姑且不論），那末黑市外滙的供給勢將史减，日方套取外滙的計劃，必將更難施行。是不管自食其果也。</p>
<p>（四）法幣强固與日圓荏弱</p>
<p>法幣匯率暴　後，日圓在滬市場格雖亦略趨堅挺，但遠不到其應逹的標準。六月七日外匯平準基金委員會限制供給黑市外匯的前一天，日圓在上海的價格是九角二分，法幣的價格是八辨士二五；到最近法幣跌到六辨士半，日金理應昇至一元一角七分，而實際上却仍在一元之內徘徊，未能衝出平價，似頗耐人玩味。其實，這倒也並不是很難解釋的。日圓在日本國內雖因政府强力的統制，表面上仍維持着一先令二辨士的官價，但因國家財政的困難，通貨的膨脹，準備金的枯竭，貿易的惡化，日圓對內對外用途的限制，以及對華戰事的漸趨失敗，就是愛國心很强的日本國民自已，也已對於日圓的前途表示悲觀。這在上海公開市上所表現的日圓跌價，便是最好的證據。反之，法幣準備金却依然豐富，對內可以自由購貿貨物，對外可以自由掉換外匯，日人也深信法幣的基礎，於是一等滙價稍稍有利，就拼命以日圓掉取法幣，結果市塲上日圓供過於求，滙價自然就又落回去。這種簡單的事實，已由日人自己向我們說明法幣强固的基礎，還用我們懷疑嗎？</p>

<h3>中日貨幣戰之回顧與展望</h3>
<p>— 安石</p>
<p>一，中日貨幣戰之嚴重性</p>
<p>近代戰爭，其勝敗可說是繫於經濟基礎之强弱，國民政府之所以主張長期抵抗者，也不外着眼於日本經濟基礎脆弱不堪一擊一點。然而資本家的生產方法，是以商品交換爲其存在條件的，而商交換，復須以貨幣為媒介，故在某意義上，經濟戰也可說是貨幣戰。在前綫有忠男將士之肉搏，在後方（允其是淪陷區和租界）法幣也不斷和日鈔偽幣作着激烈的鬬爭。假使將來有人作這决中日大戰記而把這位勇士（法幣）光榮的戰續付諸等閑，那部大戰記定</p>
<p>八一三以前各國的對華貨幣政策，現在無暇言及。不過我們要知道此决中日戰爭，在某意義上，中國的貨幣政策可說是己傳日本不得不冒險作孤注一擲要因之一。所以日本對於法幣所取政策，實具有很　重的意義和性實。因法幣其礎之鞏固和銀歸國有，日本在開戰的當初，就預料到對華貨幣戰之難關重重。就是他們滿以爲比較地沒有問題的華北，也嘗盡了不少的困苦！（未完）</p>

<h3>販賣銅元　對本對利　鎳幣分幣同遭刦</h3>
<p>近來銅元日見缺乏，分幣亦形稀少，零星交易之找付，頗感困難，乘電車或公共汽車，尤感不便，各報雖有記載，大都皮相之談，未能得其眞相，茲將彼方所以收買之故一述之。</p>
<p>銅元二百枚，約重市秤二斤半，可售法幣一元，利益佔百分之五十。前淸之龍紋銅元，成角最高，份量亦重，某方收集後，盛於酒甍中，裝輪出運。中國爲之收買販運者，多爲烟兌業及奸民，四出搜求，或赴鄉村收買，買價每元少二三十枚不等。收集後運往虹口。錢兌業販運者較少，只有四川路寗波路北某錢莊，曾見數十袋運往，誠宅羣之馬。其他收集而有組織者，如銅皮廠，翻砂廠等，私自鎔成銅塊，銷售於九金店，船廠，或出口商，利益更豐。今五金市價紫銅塊九九成色，每市担爲八十五元。又七折成色，每市担爲六十五元。翻砂銅料每市扣爲五十元。</p>
<p>與分幣原相輔而行，自舊當十銅元絕跡後，烟兌業已停止供給，或兌十角，由兌者找進一分分幣。需要旣殷，遂有暗市，法幣一元，兌分幣僅九十枚，尚不易兌得。某方收買分幣亦極殷切，法幣一元，僅收分幣八十枚，以無準備之紙幣，雖買十枚二十枚，尚是儻來物，何况所得不止此耶。</p>
<p>鎳幣流行未久，數量無多，華軍西移後，鎳幣改由香港運滬，近某方憑藉武力，搜查外輪數决，運滬之　幣，盡被沒收，民間被刦奪者，更　論及。鎳幣來源旣絕，流通數量日减，况鎳幣之材料，尤貴於銅鉛，自爲綑載而去矣。</p>
<p>銅元在民初與軍閥時代，以濫鑄之結果，湘鄂流通之大銅元（當制錢二十文），一元可兌三百餘枚，即單銅元六百餘枚。單銅元由湘鄂運滬者充斥市間，兌價放長，物價高漲，一二八後，一元曾兌三百八十餘枚，分幣初流行時，亦兌三百二十餘枚，近一二年間，立於法定價格，未嘗稍更。近則爲某方盡量收集作軍火原料矣。然某方收集銅元，私運出口，巳數年於茲。長江輪茶役水手，皆販運大銅元轉售於虹口各錢莊，更售於某方，私運出口、以販運者之衆，日積月累，損失不可以數計，沿海口岸與華北各地併計之，銅元走私，年達五千萬元之上。將數十年所鑄造，所積蓄，於最短期間滾滾東流，恐非至枯竭不止也。尤以民國二十五年二十六年八一三以前走私之盛，達於極點。華北浪人大規模走私外，本埠某國輪出口時，浪人結隊而行，金條銀幣銅元，悉載以去，明目張膽，拒絕干涉，此非可以走私爲言矣。及江南諸區淪陷，歐美市塲所售出之黃金白銀，皆爲我之國寳，近日金價飛漲，外匯暴跌，又未始非與金銀銅元同其原因也。（遠）</p>

<h3>縱慾的幾點害處　及其醫學上的補救</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南</p>
<p>動物爲欲延綿種族，故有其生殖之本能，性的衝動，就是此本能表現的一種徵象。但此性慾若過分放縱，則身體各部大蒙其害，尤其能縮短人類的生命一端，爲各國醫師所一致證實者。</p>
<p>所以要預防早衰，延長壽命，除注意平日的飲食起居之外，應調節其兩性生活，現在醫學已今非昔比，大爲進步，業證明縱慾之後，對於腦力之斵傷，性機能之减弱，及生育之障碍等等，愈爲明顯可攷。</p>
<p>身心各部尚未發育成熟，即有性行爲者，亦可目爲縱慾。再如身體素來孱弱，先天不足，雖每月祇作性交一次或兩次，而巳感覺身體萬分疲勞者，則此一兩次之性行為，不妨亦認爲過度，凡能减弱身體的健康之房事，求術生者，應避免爲是。</p>
<p>照現代最進步的醫學論斷，若長期禁慾，亦不是生長妙法，所以每個人之性行爲，須隨其人的健康狀態如何，而加以決定。靑年在十六七歲時，其一滴一點的精液，係屬奠定其將來健康所需之材料，此時若犯上自凟，或竟荒淫無度，結果，身體大爲斷傷，頭痛，頭重，耳嗚，心悸，健忘，失眠種種早衰腎虧毛病，叢集而來，故年未滿二十之靑年，不論環境如何相宜，以獨身爲是，然若頻頻自戕，則又當別論</p>
<p>縱慾過度之後，除發生上述各症之外，對於性力亦突然低弱，早洩，腎虧，絕嗣等疾，遂接踵爆發，治療時，則以內服德國畢丸精質製劑男用「補體康」最佳，因該劑之成分完全採取犢牛，及牡鹿，猩猩，海狗，山羊等舉丸，用科學方法，提出其精質，試想以雄壯動物之精質以補人體精質之不足，自當發揮其偉大之治效，余在臨床上證實其有補腦，補血，補腎之功，其女用者，爲調經種子良藥。</p>

<h3>淋病根治新理</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師</p>
<p>淋病一症，非眞不治者，其所以難於治愈者，因延宕誤治而成壞症，最佳須及早作正確之醫治，始可達到目的，吾則如果遷延時日。病毒日深。安能於短期內望其根治？不過此語指慢性淋病之難於最短期根治而已。並非說其不能根治也。因為淋毒一成慢性，其毒素已不集中於尿道，而散處於各部，故治療起來，共時間上無治療急性淋者之短也。故病家宜平心靜氣，信任醫家治療。</p>
<p>惟余恒見一般淋病患者，以其病之不能一時獲效。乃不免頻露焦窘之念。而市上一般成藥，乃投其所好，謂其種成藥，一定可在指顧間內可以斷根。於淋病患者袒擇目的，不擇手段，爭相服用。結果每不能得到預期之目的而招失望。或者較未病前爲尤劇，此蓋不知淋病之眞相。所以才錆成這樣的錯誤。因爲天下根本無那種神話上所說一二天可好之淋病內服藥。</p>
<p>以我實騐，最符吾人理想中之淋藥，以德國彼德博士所發明「克淋儂」為最。因此劑係根據非特異性療法，採用蛋白體黃色素混合製成。經過千百次之實地試騐，及各國著名之花柳病院試騐，逐步改良，以至盡善盡美之境。。與彼粗製濫造之市上成樂，迥不相同。凡一切新老白濁，經過各種市醫手術，針藥，以及服用各種市上成藥所不愈者，服「克淋儂」莫不在三五星期內完全根治。並可外用「抗淋水」女子淋毒白帶可外用！「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，尤易奏效。</p>
<h3>最新治肺良藥</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>對於肺病的治療，各國醫家雖有發明。而結核病之勢力，迄有增無已。良以藥治有特效者鮮，通常所習用之藥物，雖亦能奏功於一時，惟無絕對之功效，以是醫家病家。莫不苦之，惟有用沃度及石灰質等組成之藥，有改善體質與治療機轉之作用而具强大之殺菌力也「補肺拿爾」一藥，根據上述原理發明製成，本品對於肺病，奏功確實，凡咯血咯痰，咳嗽氣急，胸部隱痛，血痰混濁，食慾减退，潮熱盜汗，顏面蒼白，身體削瘦等，服之無不奇騐，以其能塡補石灰質，而使肺中空洞愈合，故不論一二三期肺病，服之皆有卓效。</p>
<h3>自凟遺精的青年　將來有否做丈夫的資格</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>自凟遺精的青年是這樣的多，我們醫學界雖不斷地向他們勸告，但真正能脫離歧途，改過自新的青年却占少數，而在社會的每個角落裏，尙有很多的青年，在進行他們性的罪惡，藉以滿足其慾望，久而久之，不僅其整個的意志為其消磨殆盡，而對於結婚，亦將成為嚴重之問題。</p>
<p>因為自凟是能迅速地摧殘性機能的，並能陷於過敏狀態，所以自凟的人婚後必有早洩現象，尤其在發育時期的青年，每因自凟而引起遺精，精血不斷流洩，發育亦受共阻碍而停止，致成陰萎腎虧之症，而早洩，陰萎，腎虧的青年，素為每個女子所憎惡，因其不能行美滿的性生活，及担負生男育女的責任，所以這樣種人是沒有做丈夫的資格的，但在醫學上，要恢復這種人的健康，其最新辦法，爲進服睪丸精質製劑「補體康」法了，有遺精者則應服「耐而斯遺精片」，方能奏效，故凡有患此種毛病的人，切宜早日省悟爲要。</p>

<h3>白濁易致性神經衰弱</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>……性神經是極爲脆弱而富于敏感之神經故易陷衰弱</p>
<p>……故佳在淋菌未入睪丸等深部內生殖器時即行治愈</p>
<p>淋濁之容易毁滅性機能，是由於淋菌多叢集於生殖器官之故。蓋因淋菌有善於逃竄的本領，及外生殖器與內生殖器有尿道等作爲溝通之道，最著者如由後尿道侵入攝護腺，睪丸等部分，而成爲攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，當然一成此等病變，極易傷害病家之性神經，所以對淋病療法，不可不極爲愼重治療，倘若偶一不愼，即有使攝護腺，睪丸等組織陷于崩潰之境。故吾人如一旦已知淋病患者已成攝護腺炎，即須迅速爲之設法負責根治，若是遷延一刻，誤治一着，則淋菌往往向內部侵略，而有併發睪丸炎之危險。</p>
<p>如何可以避免此等危險，則如能請求有經騐而富於責任心之醫師治療，始可免於此等不良之轉歸。患者在未續發睪丸炎之前，可用敏捷的按摩手術，及德國静電療法，與未淋病聖藥「克淋儂」等，加以迅速之挽救，撲滅淋菌，則攝護腺炎之症，既已完全治愈，而淋神經衰弱（如攝護腺漏，遺精，早洩）等症，亦可治愈，並恢復固有之健全性能。切勿因循自誤，致招將來夫婦愛情之不和諧而有噬臍之悔也　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角並贈價值一元之拙著「性病全書」一厚册。</p>

<h3>青年底舊嗜好從那裏來的？</h3>
<p>— 消人</p>
<p>幾年前，曾經有人把「五四運動」時代舊文學家嘴上的話抄下來指導靑年，那話是：「要新文學好，舊文學先得有根柢繞行!」這話在五四運動一時代，本是舊文學家底一條妙計。那時因為新文學勝利了，舊文學家感到了危險，便想出了這樣的一句話，要一面拉住舊文學，一面又向成了名的新文學家送一下「秋波」。可是現在，也有人在說這話，而他們却是「貨眞價實」的新文學家。那作用倒好像因爲有些靑年作家，寫得比他們高明，看得不耐煩，於是抬出舊文學來威嚇一下。意思是。：「你們不要得意，那樣寫法到底總是不行的！」自然，這也確把自己底地位給相當的穩住了，不過對於靑年可實在沒有好處。從前舊文學家用這句話引誘得一般新人物爬了上去，做了先賢，烏烟瘴氣地談了一通國故」，開了幾張所謂國學書的目錄。可是這回却只能使青年垂頭喪氣，不敢再寫。這呌作「一代不如一代」。結具呢，除了使靑年染上些連本人也莫明其妙的舊嗜好而外，却是甚麽花樣也沒有留下，</p>
<p>而同時也就來了方塊詩。那是新新，作者又多半是懂得外國文的人，並且還宣言是模做外國底甚麼體的。但讀者却很奇怪，不能賞識那種藝術，要讀下去就非打瞌睡不可。這便暗暗地應了從前舊文學家底預言。：「中國文學根本和外國文學不同，要模倣外國就會弄得不像樣！而目事實確是不錯的，詩既寫成了方塊，又沒有詩味！那麼，還不如五言，七言，爽快得多了。於是又有新文學家出來自已打了一通耳光，說新詩能吾成立，實在還是問題。這一來，舊詩便真的抬頭了，你一首，我一首，大家都挽起袖子做起來了。結果呢，除了使靑年染上些速本人也莫明其妙的舊嗜好而外，却是期甚麽花樣也沒有留下。</p>
<p>不知道怎麼弄的，忽然又來了「京派」和「海派」的吵架。吵出的結論是：「京派行，「海派」不行。於是「海派」奮抉而起，追隨了「京派」。從此大潮流產生了。「性靈文學，眞正的文學，「語錄文」是前進的文體。「性强」底祖宗本是明人底小品文，但不久却擴大到所謂「珍本」。自然，這是好的，但有些「本」却實在並不「珍」，後來竟連枼紹袁給自已老婆編的半真半假的詩集也成了青年必讀的寶貝了。「語錄文」不像「白話文的嚕哩一，這當然也是好的，可以省些紙張，但省下的紙張却印文言和舊詩、而最古怪的是「性靈」派大師却又捧出了個」野叟曝言。——這潮流可真把人衝得頭昏眼花起來了。結果呢，更加不用說，除了使青年染上些速本人也莫明其妙的舊嗜好而外，却是甚麼花樣也沒有留下。</p>
<p>在敎師方面，也是先由「京派」前輩發起了運動。考試的學生寫錯了一個字，考宮便動起筆來大大地挖苦一通，而挖苦的方法也是做舊詩，——打油的舊詩。這又使得「海派」的後輩羨慕了起來，於是主張靑年在古書裏專字彙。到底青年專出來了沒有，似乎還沒有人調查過，不過從主張者底口氣看來，要不去專，是會給他們扣分數的。而且事實上可也真怪不得，許多大學招考的國文試題都是在搬古書，不是「易經」，便是「修體」，好像越古越合式，其實出那些題目的人，也未必能夠不查書就都知道，要他們換作學生去投考，說不定還會交白卷吧。但總之結果呢，不用說越發是除了使青年染上些這本人也莫明其妙的舊嗜好而外，却是甚麼花樣也沒有留下。</p>
<p>這些都是我們名人底功績。算來自然也並不很多，但就是這幾件已經很可以把一些靑年拉到倒車上去了。我同意前幾天尚卿先生底主張，應該全體當敎師的人認眞給靑年一點好的指導。但是實際上是不是做得到呢？</p>
<h3>誓掃胡廛不顧身（木刻）</h3>
<p>— 李一山</p>
<h3>坑（下）</h3>
<p>— 電長</p>
<p>我平視着祇見前面兩隻腿在移動過來，於是叉俛下去掘掘；忽然拍的又轉了過去，脚步聲漸漸遠了我底耳朶，我才又透了一口氣，把泥都向後撥上了，地面上更堆得高高的。</p>
<p>我想，要是那傢伙從背後來，蹴上幾脚，把泥全掃下，我可整個都埋葬在這裏了。</p>
<p>我額上的汗汨汨地淌着：光景眞成爲掘你老子的墳？這是我底墳墓嗎？咳，越想越是，却越寒心……我便急急的回過頭，聳起脚尖望着，又忽忙地劃着坑壁，底下拚命的挖出幾步泥梯來。</p>
<p>一會，耳邊果然有上微細的脚步聲，我於是揑緊鏟，把右腳踏着坑壁，地向後轉了，却又站定。</p>
<p>我馬上踏上了一級，心口跳呀跳的跳個不停，却見那傢伙下舉著步槍瞄準前面一個跑</p>
<p>「砰——」槍聲劃破了長空，我忙着縮下，等了一會，再用鏟撑起一看，前面兩隻腿却抖呀抖的退了過來，那傢伙膝頭向兩邊左右一彎，一收，又站定了。</p>
<p>「砰——」我想跑來的人完了，便伏在坑壁邊靜聽，皮靴擦着地面的聲音很淸晰，我又點起脚尖，兩隻顫動的腿離開我底頭祗五六尺光景。突然，我下意識地與奮了起來，掣着鏟倏的從坑壁中爬出，伏在地上滾了過去；但那像伙却立刻很機敏的回過頭，對着我像瘋狗般地用步槍刺下。</p>
<p>「砰——」我眼前一黑，冒着槍聲猛勁地挺了起來，乘勢着鏟在他肩上劈個正着，他就僵直地倒了下去。</p>
<p>我拭拭額上的汗，很驕傲地對這段橫着的黃蠟燭笑了笑。我叉遠遠地一望，那個人正向這邊走來。</p>
<p>一「哈哈，是鷺鷥阿八嗎？」我看淸是他，便喊了起來，「我救了你底命了！」</p>
<p>他慢呑呑地走近了，手中提着駁壳，很從容地說：「我在那邊瞧着你挖掘墳墓已經好些時候了，現在你葬了他吧。」我便過去仔細看看，地上却滿淌着血，我看他肩上的創痕有多少深——這正是我底傑作呢，這麽有力的一劈。</p>
<p>但那傢伙肩上却連衣服也不曾破碎一些，血却汨汨地從背上流出。</p>
<p>我才明白了，很慚愧地向鷺鷥阿八打招呼：</p>
<p>「我給灰孫子掘墳掘了好半天，眞累死了：謝謝你，帮帮我扛到那坑裏去好嗎？」</p>
<h3>奔泉</h3>
<p>— 丁諦</p>
<p>『光榮的泉水！願我心如你的新群，持久，向上，生生不息。』——HewoI</p>
<p>奔泉，我愛他有力的激蕩。</p>
<p>不是黑水湫裏綠得發霉的死水，不是停瀦在一條狹狹的河內永遠那麼靜止的波流，不像湖水那末柔弱，輕佻而無力，也不那末平，祇向兩岸展開：牠向上，一股股力，朝上湧，不斷的開展，空氣壓一不了牠，奔騰，夭矯如遊遊龍。悠長的日月拖過一條灰色朦朧的影子，泉聲在一片朦朧中，奏出不斷的樂歌來。朦朧中，有金鱗閃爍。</p>
<p>沒有停止的時候，水永遠不會乾，山澗中，谿谷內，枯藤亂葉的離披間，你去尋找吧，那兒永遠激蕩着一泓翠碧的漣漪，幽杳無盡的小崖深處，懸掛下一幅匹練的銀光，閃耀着太陽，也混和着山間的紅花，小草和樹葉，嘩浪浪的奔騰，表示出這是自然的巨樂，蓬勃生命的高歌。</p>
<p>探視泉源的無盡，你所咸的不是失望，不是渺茫，你會因此更開拓生命的領域。</p>
<p>譬如說人生是一股奔流吧。人生該有一個核心，這猶如說，我們吃蘋果，梨子或胡桃，不都是有一個討厭的核心嗎？探討這核心，不比我們隨意撕去一個水果皮，或者敲碎一個乾果的硬殼。追逐那生命的眞理吧，這猶如說，探討那最後的泉源。</p>
<p>然而說眞理永遠沒有麼？我知道牠有一個核心。「追逐那眞理吧。」</p>
<p>我說，「我愛那泉源　。」</p>
<p>我記得兩年前看過的景物。</p>
<p>是虎跑泉山門外。新綠點染上山坡。浮起一陣淸香，山嵐撲眉，眉蒼然。在石縫中，靠土崖邊，崖上一排樹，有些不規律，又好像雜亂。樹陰蓋在泉水上，汨汨的微聲，一連片響，透開陰翳。像繫在耳朶上的繩，泉水聲跟着我走，走上石階……</p>
<p>也是在杭州，黯沈沈的楠木林中，去九溪十八澗，路上轉了幾個灣，我走入豁然的境地。湧着含蓄的力，流過狹窄的山崖，幾個盤旋，衝蕩着山石，濺開粒粒水珠。回頭時，我漸漸走遠，望望那白石，我想，該是什麽時候流起的呵？我給牠記算。</p>
<p>寒天著天，牠不停的在動，朝上湧，朝下流。現在我給牠記算吧，牠也還在流。流成曲曲灣灣的澗水，從山谷：低蔽於枯枝亂葉間，載落紅小舟，再流向不可知。也許重歸於山谷？</p>
<p>離開杭州時，給我自己計算一下，整整兩年了。舊日的泉水，已不知流往那兒去，連我家裏金魚盆中自製的一個小噴泉，也早已毁壞得無影無踪了。我失望嗎？不，我知道泉水仍然是在流，一分一秒地在流，不疲倦，也不休息。</p>
<p>拿石頭堵住了牠，也許你看到泉水有暫時停止的不幸，但這泉水的力量一衝開障碍時，你知道牠比以前更有力。把握住長期的生命，泉水永遠沒有死亡。</p>
<p>從沒有人制伏過泉水，我們知道有許多石頭已經腐爛了。</p>

<h3>舊金山華僑情形</h3>
<p>]</p>
<p>舊金山一埠約有華人十萬餘人，皆係自行操作，謀食餬口；其工値大小不等，少者一月亦可得廿餘金，多者則幾不下百金。其製造皮履者，操業雖微而贏利獨多·惟土人嫉害華人，已非一次，因奪其利藪也。時時思欲操戈相向，其人皆係來自英之威立士多，出自貧窮，無以爲生，金山開埠以來，已在此闢土地，長子孫，一旦爲華人攬其所業，以是銜憾切齒，必欲殺而甘心也。至花旗大之待華人頗善，地方官亦爲之時時保護，奈土人甚衆，其勢亦强，而花旗人少，不足以敷彈壓·近日自舊金山正埠至紐約，築成輪車鐵路，往來便捷，苟遇警調兵，七日可至，故殊不慮土人之肆其荼毒也。</p>
<h3>海軍駛燕臺</h3>
<p>國家先已傳令廣東派舊式兵船十六艘，又火輪兵船六艘，均於夏秋之間，駛赴燕臺，靜候調撥。由今揣測，疑爲臺灣之事，將有用兵之舉，故拘集鉅艇，所以載運兵士也。</p>
<h3>撫軍轎輿騰空</h3>
<p>吳中張撫軍，將欲拜客，轎傘旗幟，均已伺候齊集，突有軍門晋謁，撫軍不得已接晤之，乃客未去，而撫軍之轎已騰空矣。但聞忽刺一聲，烟焰蔽空，綠呢轎變爲赤火球，蓋火藥爆炸也。撫軍於驚駭之餘，傳齊差官訊詰，知爲斥退之巡捕官所爲。軍門之來，不先不後，使撫軍免於火厄，亦云巧矣。</p>

<h3>懲治貪汚之立法沿革</h3>
<p>— 靖</p>
<p>國民政府，於上年六月二十七日公布懲治貪汚暫行條例，全文都十一條，定自公布之日施行。</p>
<p>官吏犯賊，刑法瀆職罪章，原設有許細之規定，惟現値　國家危急存亡之秋，軍人，公務員，及辦理社會公益事務之人，丁茲　步阽危之際，宜如何　隅自守，勵精圖治，復何心肝，而萌貪汚之念，上為國蠢，下為民賊？此政府所以於刑法瀆職罪章之外，理頒布特別刑法，亦「治亂國用重典」之意也。</p>
<p>官吏犯賊，歷代刑法皆從重比，秦漢以前，無論已，李悝法經，以受財枉法，列諸首篇盜法，良以賄雖非盜事，而迹其貪心，與盜無殊，　惡之心，可以想見。　簘職制門，諸監臨　司受財枉法者，一杖一百；一疋，加一等；十五疋，絞。不枉法者，一尺，杖九十；二疋，加一等；三十疋，加役流。無祿者，各减一等。枉法者，二十疋，绞。不枉法者，四十疋，加役流。至明律處罰更峻，特設受賊一門，規定有祿人枉法賊，一貫以下，杖十七；以次　加，二十貫以上，加從；四法賊，一貫以下，杖十七；以次　加，二十貫以上，加從；四十五貫以上，加流；，至八十貫者，絞，不枉法賊，一貫以下，杖六十；五十貫以上，加徒；一百貫以上，加流。無祿人枉法賊，一百二十貫，絞。不枉法賊一百二十貫以上，罪止杖一百，流三千里。相沿迄清，未從輕减，即前清最後施行之现行刑律受贼門，官吏受財，亦規定有祿人枉賊一兩以一步步，處七等罰，以次遞加，二十兩以上，處徒刑，四十五兩處流刑；八上兩，絞。不枉法賊，一兩以上，處六等罪；五十兩以上，處徒刑，一百兩以上，處流刑；一百二十兩以上，絞。無祿人枉法賊，一百二十兩，絞；不枉法賊，一百二十兩以上，罪止流三千里。民國以來，自暫行新刑律以還。均有瀆職專章；惟民國三年曾頒布官司吏犯賊治罪法，雖條文寥寥可數，而處罰特嚴，有京兆尹王某，因收受賄賂，而為違背職務之行為，即適用該條例第二項，處以死刑，是為賄賂事件適用特別法濫觴。該法至民國五年七月，以明令廢止。民國十年三月又公布官司吏犯賊治罪條例，定施行期為三年。期滿並未延長。洎首國民政府成立以後，對於　廉潔，禁官司邪，三令五申，並於民國十五年九月，公布黨員背誓治罪條例，對黨員以職權操縱金融，圖利自己或他他者，或舞弊侵呑庫款，滿一千元者，處以死刑並沒收其財產。至民國十七年，最高法院又以解孚第二一一號，解釋例，擴充其適刖範圍，凡任官職而犯賊者，均許適用該條例處斷，更有主張特設懲治貪汚專庭者，一倡百和，雖未見諸事實，鮁懲治貪汚運動，一時雷厲風行。二十年二月十七日，黨員背誓條例廢止，此後關於賄賂事件，遂適用普通刑法處斷。按十七年九月施行之刑法瀆職罪章中，對於枉法賄賂之處刑，則以處無期徒刑或五年以上有期徒刑得併科一萬元以下罰金為期最高度，更帥舊律「計賊論罪」之遺意，許於所得利益範圍內加重。（刑法第五十八條）綜觀歷來關於懲治貪汚之立法體例，雖不盡同，然精神一貫，固相沿不替也。</p>
<p>方今時値非常，又復公布懲治貪汚暫行條例，在沿革上觀　，雖無可怪駭，然試就期內容一加探討，有足稱者：</p>
<p>一、施行期間　舉凡暫行之特別法規，其施行之期限多所限制，少所伸縮，懲治貪汚暫行條例，則以作戰期內為其施行期間，換言之；戰事期間，即本條例施行之期間，戰事一日不失效，蓋潦清官吏，為完成建國大衆之一端，而修養廉潔，係整飭官司方之肯務；本條例所定犯罪之客體，類皆屬於戰時之性質，如軍餉，軍工，軍用品，軍用舟車，航空機，馬匹，馱獸等是。故以作戰期內，為其施行之期間，所以謀法律適用之便宜，亦所以適應環境之需要一也。</p>
<p>二、主體範圍　普通刑法瀆職罪之主體，原則上以公力員為限，而軍人及辦理公益事務之人不與焉，即歷來之特別法，亦莫不如是。如官吏犯賊治罪法，其行為人以官司吏為限；黨員背誓治罪條例，其行為人以黨圓及非黨員而凡任官職為限。本條例之犯罪主人體，則包括軍人公務員及辦理社會公益事務之人三者，實為歷來懲治貪汚之立法例，放一異彩。</p>
<p>三、最高制度　按貪汚科鄉，向從嚴峻，暫行新刑律瀆職罪章中，關於貪汚處刑之最高度，為一等有期徒刑；舊刑法瀆職罪章中，關於貪汚之處刑，其最高度為三年以上七年以下有期徒刑，現行刑法瀆職罪章中，關於貪汚處刑之最高度，為無期徒刑，雖　輕不等，然罪止於徒，不至於死。在特別法中，如官司吏犯賊治罪條例第二條，第二項，黨員背誓治罪條例，第三條及第四條是雖最重之刑為死刑，但前者施行期限，早經屆滿，後者明令廢止，亦已七年，懲治貪汚，漸見寛弛，無可諱　。在此作戰期內，如　復　犯賊，影響所及，貽誤特甚，故本條例以死刑為最重刑。</p>
<p>四、犯罪態樣　按刑法瀆職罪章中，除第一二九條第三項對認新途徑務員違法征收租稅入款及抑留　扣慶發款項物品者之示遂犯，有處罰之特別規定外；其餘瀆職罪，皆無處罰未遂之明文。至若陰謀犯罪之處罰，僅於內亂與外患罪，設有特別規定，預備犯罪之處罰，僅於內亂，外患，公共危險及殺人，强盜，據人勒贖等罪，設有特別規定，關於瀆職罪之陰謀或預備。則均在不罰之列。是在平時，似已失諸寬弛，　作戰期內，懲治貪汚之範圍，萬有擴充之必要；蓋陰謀預備及未逐之三個犯罪態樣，一則屬於犯罪內部之意思，次則屬於犯罪內部之意思，次則屬於犯罪準備之行為，三則屬於犯罪實行之不遂，雖其犯罪程度，尚未完成，然以在作戰期內之貪汚犯罪而論，已皆足以認定犯人惡性之重大，本條例特設專條，併予罰，深俁誅必之旨。</p>
<p>五、財產沒收　本條例關於沒收之規定，立法體例，極盡完備。除　兇本條例之罪者，其所得賊款物，屬於公有者，應予追繳。　非屬於公有者，應依其情形，分別予以沒收或發還受害人者外。　凡賊款賊物之全部或一部，無法追繳，或不能沒收者，則追征其價額。　經追征而無力繳納，則又以沒收財產，為執行追征之方法。　其財立價値不及應追征之價額時，並許酌留家族必需之生活費，亦罪不及妻妤之意耳。抑又有言者；按沒收之物，依前大理院及司法院之解釋，向以動產為限。（參照司法院院字第五七四號，統字第一一四八號解釋）。然就刑法第三十八條而為擴充之解釋，則不動產亦非不可沒收，本條例列舉賊　賊物兩者，前者固專指動產，後者當係包括不動產在內，從而追片沒收之財產，依本條例規定，亦應從　　解釋。</p>
<p>六、管轄機關　本條例以作戰期內為施行期限，犯罪之主體，又係包括軍人在內，保護之客體，並多戰時之性質，旣如上述，則其管轄，自應以屬於軍事機關者為當。故犯本條例之罪者，無論軍人，公務員，或辦理社會公益事務之人，均由軍事機關審判及執行。至於指定管轄，亦由軍事機關為之，自不待言。</p>
<p>懲治貪汚暫行條例之沿革及其特點，旣如前述，然立法上之如何完善，施行上之如何順利，究非吾人所樂聞，必也無訟，始期於無刑，唯望舉國上下對於懲治貪汚暫行條例之施行，加以深切之認識，交相惕勵，「國家之敗，由官邪也，」願共勉之！</p>
<p>裁判輯要</p>
<p>（要高法院上海特區分庭）</p>
<p>以支標清償貨款之舊債務，該支票旣不獲兌現，即屬不履行票據之新債務，依民法第三二〇條規定，其舊債務仍不消滅。（民二十八年度滬上字第二十四號）</p>
<p>認定事實，取捨證據，屬於事實審法院之職　，茍其認定事實取捨證據於法無違，自不容當事人任意指摘其不當。（民二十八年度滬上字第二十六號）</p>
<p>法律質疑</p>
<p>（問）保險人破產時，除第七十九條另有規定外，何險契約於破產宣後，經過一個月後終止，為保險法第二十八條前半段所明定，何以人壽保險契約與其他保險契維異其終止時效？保險人旣已宣告皮產，是其財產顯不足清償債務，於其破產後一個月內尚屬有效，此時危險發生，保險人已無力賠償，即以其應得之保險金額，交付於債權人平均分派，所得亦屬有限，實非保護被保險人或受益人之道。立法理由何在？乞一度賜說明，以啟愚蒙！（向炯）</p>
<p>（答）保險人破產時，捐失保險契約與人壽保險契約，異其終止時效，確屬一値得研究之問題。愚於起草修止保險法時，亦曾注意及此，且思有以修正之。座因該項條文，係採自法國法例，意為必有特殊原因，未敢擅動，惟於立法院開審曾時將欲加以改正之理由對衆說明，希望於審查會中修改之，終因種種關係仍維原文，未予更動。此為保險法第二十八條及第七十九條修行訂之原委，而其立法理由如何，實有研討之必要也。</p>
<p>就愚見所及，人壽保險契約之訂立，其期限常較長，而保險費之計算，則視年齡之大小而定，契約一經訂立，則要何人每年應付之保險費即屬一律不變，故四十歲時訂立之人壽保險契約，其每年應付之保險費，即較四十一歲時訂立之人壽保險費為低，因此，人壽保險契約，於訂立後萬一因故終止，再向他保險人訂契約時，其契約之條件，即不能與前契維相同，縱使為保護要保人計，規定保險人破產時，使其契約終止時效，延長一個月，與　失保險契約相同，仍不能便要保人再與他保險人訂立同一條件之人壽保險契約，依然於事無補，不如使之於保險人破產時終止之為也截了當。至捐失保險契維期間，通常均以一年為度，為保護被保險人計，立法者規定延遲一月終止，使要保人得向　保險人重訂同一條件之保險契約，不致於即時終止後之短期間內受有捐失，或為該兩條立法之主要原因，亦未可知，因保險人之債務，不僅賠償責任之一種，其他尚有財產上抵押等等之欠款，法律規定特使損失保險契約終止時效遲延一月，亦即所以保護被保險人之利益也。（王效文）</p>

<p>（答）（一）甲乙既無和姦情形，應不為罪。（二）送禮亦非犯罪行為。（三）甲旣使君有婦？乙亦羅敷有夫，如果同居，觸犯刑法第二三九條之罪。（四）甲如有敎唆或帮助自殺之行為，應負刑法第二七五條之罪責。（五）婚書，並非結婚必備之方式，如乙與其夫，確曾結婚，則左婚姻關係存續中，其夫自非無權過問。（璜）</p>
<p>（問）乙死後，其弟丙，向乙妻甲誘姦，生子丁，丙因有妻室，遺棄甲丁母子於不顧。（一）甲與丙可自由脫離關係否？（二）丁歸甲扶養合法否？（三）丁待成年有何手續及結果？（游顧氏）</p>

<h3>父債子還</h3>
<p>— （无用）</p>
<p>「父債子還」，為幾千年來一般社會所承認的。可是同行的法律，為恐目暴自棄理沒人才，便有「限定繼承」「拋棄繼承權」的規定，那拋棄繼承的，無論父母的資產負債都不管，限定繼承的，父母的遺產不夠還債的時候，父母的債也不負責任了。</p>

<h3>一件簡而易行的工作</h3>
<p>— 剛尼</p>
<p>香烟畫片為一般下層勞苦大在衆們以及穩中有降識淺薄的孩子們所歡迎，所以牠是負着敎育大衆們的責任，無形之中，對他們的影響殊大，尤其是在這偉大的時代，祖國，民族，正在生死存亡的時候，而我們又處此逆境……</p>
<p>最近市上有一種呌大錨牌的香烟，牠的香烟畫片是一幅幅凄慘的流亡區，背面選有「流亡曲」，流亡曲（四）是這樣的：</p>
<p>——來到繁華的都市，</p>
<p>實指望託足相依；</p>
<p>那知道地生人不熱，貧苦實難醫，</p>
<p>乞食街頭，</p>
<p>寒缺衣，</p>
<p>家亡何處歸？</p>
<p>這樣的取材，是取諸血腥的現實，和週遭的親切的環境的，而且文字的形式是取「歌曲」體，昜淺　顯易懂，有些是大衆的「活的口語」，因之就愈接近大衆，適合大衆的口胃，是很有意思的，很値得推廣開，値得效法的。</p>
<p>但我們決不是說香烟畫片的取材，一定要取這時代的現實生活，環境，就是我們歷史上的故事，（例如岳傳，以及木蘭從軍等等富有民族意識敎育意味的。）是同　有價値。</p>
<p>總之，我們很盼望各國產烟公司能更切實的負起這責任——敎育大衆的責任。這是簡而易行的工作，但牠的影響牠的意義是如何重大在啊！</p>
<h3>敲小榔頭</h3>
<p>— 硃硯</p>
<p>—一個打字員的生活紀錄—</p>
<p>早晨踏時寫字間第一椿要務，就是小心翼翼地揭開打字機上的蓋罩。當我每次撫按着那十年來相依為命的吃飯傢伙－打字機，心中不禁悽搶欲絕</p>
<p>每天上午從九點鐘到十二點鐘，下午從一點鐘到五點鐘，十個指頭「搭搭」毫不停留在打字機掀捺。有人說打字機是機器，打字員不過是機器的機器罷了。一天到晚，公文啦，信件啦，發票啦，收條啦，鐵絲籃裏堆積幾寸高去了一批又一批，簡直不給你有換口氣的餘暇。有時餱要襯十廿張拷貝紙，輕了印不出，非狠命用勁打去不可，往往弄得指頭上的皮肉，和指甲脫離關係，張開嘴吧似的創傷，痛澈心肺。有時候打三十二時長機器，又大又重，幾乎不曾把手指折斷。有時候還要用青蓮拷貝色帶，兩長手弄得像開染坊作，洗也洗不乾凈。我們那位經理先生雖然不曾出過洋，鍍過什麼顏色，但管理屬下職員，却一部分採信洋化，尤其對於打字員，資勢是否正確—腰正背直？打字的聲音是否急促而合乎拍節？管理得格外週密。如果你想倫下子懶，擔根捲烟，歇一歇力，马上請你「吃大菜」，所以每天散寫字　以後，總覺得腰指前痛，頭暈眼花，但為了生活鞭子的驅策，這又有什麼辦法呢？</p>
<p>辛苦辛苦，月底到了，領薪水了，大家枯瘦的臉龐都掛上一絲的微笑，但一個月辛勞的代價，法幣三十元。十五元一月亭子間房租已佔去了二分之一（還便哩，二房東正在想法子加房租呢！）近來米價又飛漲，二號米買到十六元多一石，柴炭煤球汕鹽醬醋，那一樣不比從前昂貴？那十五元錢那裏能夠一家幾口子的生活？妻的肚子一天大一天，分娩期就在眼前，那筆生產費用還不知在那裏？孩子們天天　靯子破了，襪子破了，也該替他們換個新。自己那襲敝舊光腻大衫呢，還是將就將就吧　地想起下星期六主任的令媛子歸之喜，這二只洋是省不下的。下星其日是經　母親的六十。下星期日是經理母親的六十冥慶，這筆禮又那裏可以不送呢？想到這裏，眼前一陳昏黑，連個「唉」字都呑了進去嘆不出氣。</p>
<p>打字員通稱為敲小榔頭」的工人，大槪是自嘲之辭吧。</p>
<h3>今年的枇杷</h3>
<p>— 徐珍</p>
<p>內地運來沿途捐稅繁重　次貨又多小販賺錢不易</p>
<p>黃熱梅子呌遍了大街小巷，這時餱，你可以看見那長得一身混毛，身穿黃紅大袍的枇杷。</p>
<p>批杷在江南，算不了一件貴重的水菓，在初夏春尾，這東西便在街頭出現，價錢並不怎麼貴，但剛上市，却酸得難熬，因為是時鮮水菓，便作為酒席，宴席上的點綴品。</p>
<p>但這幾天，上海的枇杷，已到了全盛時期，滿街滿巷，已是一片枇杷來得很少。</p>
<p>上海枇杷的批發所，和鮮魚水菓一樣，都在十六舖，這時候，旁的水菓剛剛臨時接不上來，枇杷便作為十六舖一般水菓行大宗的營業。</p>
<p>只要你一到址六舖，你就可以看見每一家行家門口及小販攤上，擱着小簍小籃的枇杷，上面蓋着一張紅色的廣告紙，一塊木板上寫着「塘棲大红袍」每簍六角五分，一洞庭山白沙軟刁」每七角半。</p>
<p>所謂「大紅袍」就是紅皮紅肉的批杷，這一種枇杷來自塘棲，價錢便宜，雖鮁有甜的，但酸口的却多得很，一不小心，只能自认倒霉。</p>
<p>所謂白沙「軟刁」，是批杷中間最好，也最甜　批杷，他生昨並不怎麼大，却很坚实，水份又多，肉现白色，滋味极甜。这种枇恕难从命是由蘇州洞庭山來的，最高的討價是八毛錢一簍，（約五六十隻）最便宜的標價，也得要六毛多。</p>
<p>我和十六舖革水菓行談了一些今年枇杷行市的情形，他表示今年枇比翼雙飛利錢打得很輕，買賣的日子也很短。</p>
<p>據說：今年的枇杷，沒有往年多，一方面沿卡的捐稅太重，一船枇杷，往往要捐二十元，如若再經過其他的卡子，照選要捐。</p>
<p>他們派人到蘇州山上去採辦枇杷，照從前走旱路，由火車上走，兩天就飛快的送到上海人的嘴裏，但現在却不行，一船枇杷非得走水路，由蘇州轉嘉興，再到上海，牠的水程，至少得八天，比較生一點的枇杷還能經得起躭擱，有些枇杷比羅熟的，一到上海，早已爛了。</p>
<p>「現在生意是不能比從前了！一這位水菓行家現午煩燥而憂慮。</p>
<p>他們把枇杷運到上海，再批發給水菓店及小販，普通紅沙枇杷最好的，是賣四塊錢十　，白沙枇杷最好的，六塊錢十簍。</p>
<p>據說今年的枇杷日子很短。大約賣到月底，市上就看不見枇杷了。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十二回　紅粉殲仇難消孽障　綠窗談愛重締良緣</p>
<p>趙樂天天醫院裏，養了好久的傷，一個獨脚的人，勢不能再上前綫。他那時眞個一無　礙，把潘佩英的影子，也漸漸的澹下來了。可是趙樂天寄給潘　英　信，以後就永不能達她的妝閣，一對一對的都被她的父親截留下來了。自然潘佩英也不能獲到自由，是由她父新暗中監視着。知道這一次覆趙樂天的信，是强迫她写的，並非出於她的自願。难保以後不由她再写信给趙樂天，否認那天的回信，不是出於本意。但她那時行動已失自由，處處的監視着，就是要寄出信去，非經父新的手不可。佩英起初的確有此心，自從寫了那對强迫的回信後，連忙想，再寫一封信去，取消前信。誰知她父新監視　密，連她寫信的機會敢沒有了。而且前一封信，就把趙樂天的住址，不給她知道，同信全由她父新經手寄出去　是毫也不放鬆。後來趙樂天寄了兩次信給佩英，都由刀子父親　留拆視。第一土是實備佩英，並口罵到她的父親。他父親這時已經煉成了老面皮了，只是笑了一知，把信向自己書桌抽屜裏一銷。所謂「笑罵由他笑罵，好官司我自為之」，古人早已形容絕倒了　　　我　　總比你乾凈些一的那此話頭。她父親看了，以為：你死了，也是白死　不比我們死了，至少在偽政府裏，還呆以領到幾萬塊錢　撫卹金呢？不過你倘然眞個死了。　我們倒有些好處。因為佩英的父親，雖然前天强迫他的女儿，寫了回信，拒絕了趙　天，知道這事是勉强的，他的女兒還是戀戀於這個青年。一切神情詞色之間，都可以看得出。為什麼他要這樣的嚴密監視呢，就是怕梢有疏懈，他們依然通信，甚　約諆有相會，偕逃出奔，都論不　呢！只看牠連日雙蛾銷，長吁短嘆，什麼都數不起她的興趣呀！要是他眞個死了，死了趙系天的身，也不死了潘佩英的心。到那時，或時給她做媒，偽政府中也不乏漂亮的男子，或以藉此聯絡居於高位的人，她不至於堅拒我父新的主張了。（一三四）</p>

<h3>Results of the Fierce Battle of the Southern Jin Army: Pinglu and Maojindu Both Recaptured; Over a Thousand Japanese Soldiers Killed in Action; Large Quantities of Military Supplies Abandoned; Stable War Situation in Central Hubei; Japanese Troops Near Qianjiang Encircled</h3>
<p>Yuanqu (Front Line Telephone Report) After six days of fierce fighting in southern Jin, on the 8th, the Chinese army withdrew from Pinglu after inflicting heavy casualties on the Japanese. From the 9th to the 10th, multiple Japanese forces converged to attack Maojindu, with numerous Japanese aircraft repeatedly bombing the entire town of Maojin into scorched earth, and it was once captured. On the afternoon of the 10th, all units of the Chinese front line were ordered to launch a simultaneous counterattack with lightning speed. The Japanese were caught off guard, and due to their exhaustion and the Chinese army's fierce offensive, Maojindu was recaptured that evening. Subsequently, taking advantage of the victory, they advanced to attack Pinglu, and on the morning of the 11th, Pinglu was captured. The remaining Japanese troops fled in disarray, abandoning large quantities of military supplies and documents along the way. While pursuing, the Chinese army pacified the local population. In this battle, over a thousand Japanese soldiers were killed, and four mountain guns, one mortar, and hundreds of machine guns and rifles were captured, along with a large amount of other military supplies. After this major victory, the Chinese army's cheers echoed throughout the Zhongtiao Mountain valley. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The war situation in central Hubei has become stable. The Chinese army is exceptionally active. Japanese troops near Qianjiang have been encircled and will not be difficult to eliminate. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to reports, Japanese troops in Shandong have recently launched a large-scale invasion against the Chinese army, advancing from the south of the Jiaoji Railway, the east of the Jinpu Railway towards Linyi, and the north, with groups of three to five hundred to a thousand men. They aim to invade southeastern Shandong. It is reported that a certain unit of the Chinese regular army is cooperating with guerrillas, engaging in separate routes to meet the enemy. Fierce battles with the Japanese army are taking place in Feixian, Mengyin, northwest Linqu and north of Linyi. The Japanese army has suffered heavy casualties. Fighting was still ongoing as of the 10th. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese reports, Japanese troops in western Shanxi are advancing towards the Yellow River, but have not yet achieved their goal. For strategic reasons, the Chinese army withdrew from Liulin and Pinglu. However, before withdrawing from Pinglu, they fiercely resisted, causing two thousand Japanese casualties. (11th Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Fierce battles between the Chinese and Japanese armies took place between Pinglu and Macun (north of Pinglu) on the 8th and 9th, with extreme intensity. The Chinese army fought bravely, and the Japanese momentum has been thwarted. On the morning of the 10th, the Japanese army gradually moved north. Currently, the Chinese army is encircling and attacking the Japanese troops in Dalangmiao, Zhangyuzhen, Dongqicun and other places. The Japanese troops at Shangniushuntou have slightly increased. Chinese officers and soldiers are engaging in hand-to-hand combat, fighting valiantly and heroically, one falling as another charges forward.

<h3>Tianjin Japanese Authorities Prepare to Implement Blockade of Concessions; Japanese Merchants Have Completed Evacuation; Britain Unwilling to Extradite Suspects; Former Soviet Consulate Occupied by White Russians</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The local Chinese Association held an emergency meeting yesterday, resolving to urgently cable the British Foreign Office, explaining the importance of the Tianjin dispute, and urging the Foreign Office to continue to consider it. Responsible parties solemnly declared that the Japanese side has not delivered a final ultimatum to the British authorities. However, it is generally believed that unless some situation prevents it, the Japanese side is likely to implement a blockade of the British Concession on June 14th or 15th. Currently, all Japanese merchant firms in the British Concession have effectively completed their evacuation, and others are also rapidly evacuating. Judging from the current situation, there is no indication that the British side will soon agree to extradite the suspects in the Cheng assassination case to the Japanese side. The Tianjin branch of the Joint Reserve Bank is one of the major institutions ordered to evacuate completely as a final measure. At the same time, the Yokohama Specie Bank, which has moved into the Japanese Concession, is now asking foreign banks to settle and clear exchange bills with it, and has announced the temporary suspension of export and exchange business. It is reported that the bank has requested importing firms to guarantee that they will no longer unload goods in the British Concession after it is blockaded. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A Tianjin report states that the Tianjin British Concession authorities have transferred Wang Qi and another man, who were allegedly found in possession of bombs, to the Japanese side. However, the Japanese side believes that the two men are not related to the Cheng assassination case and remains dissatisfied, claiming that the British side lacks sincerity. The two men were arrested in Xingheli, Da Jingchan Road, a month ago, and are both 21 years old. The case is not serious. It is generally observed that the British side may be adopting this compromise measure due to the strong stance of the Chinese side. (10th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to semi-official Japanese sources, the Tianjin Japanese authorities have taken preliminary measures to isolate the British and French concessions. The branches of the Yokohama Specie Bank and the Joint Reserve Bank in the British Concession have both moved to the Japanese Concession. The Customs has also decided to take the same action. Forty-two Japanese residents in the British Concession and fifty-nine Japanese residents in the French Concession have completed their preparations for moving their businesses. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The empty building of the former Soviet Consulate in the former Russian Concession was occupied yesterday by the White Russian Anti-Communist Committee, which stated that it would not hand it over until a legitimate government is established in Russia. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The British Residents Association held a meeting here last night and passed a resolution urging the British government to take effective measures to protect the safety of British residents here when the Japanese block the British Concession here. The concession authorities here believe that the situation is extremely tense due to the strong stance of the Japanese side and the rapid evacuation of many Japanese residents from the British Concession.

<h3>American Observer States Chiang Kai-shek's Strategy: Adopt a Defensive Posture to Extend the Japanese Line; Seek to Strengthen Guerrilla Forces; Then Implement a Large-Scale Counteroffensive</h3>
<p>(New York) Mr. Mallory published an article in today's "Foreign Affairs" magazine, titled "Chiang Kai-shek's Strategy," discussing the outcome of the Sino-Japanese War. He stated that Chiang Kai-shek had formulated a detailed plan for the war of resistance before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. According to the article, his strategy is as follows: Adopt a defensive posture until the Japanese front line is extended to the extreme; During the period of reorganization of the Chinese army, strengthen the power of guerrillas to contain the enemy in the occupied areas; After the above two goals are achieved, implement a large-scale counteroffensive. The article claimed that the Sino-Japanese War has now entered its second stage and predicted that foreign aid should be obtained when implementing the large-scale counteroffensive. The article solemnly pointed out the necessity of China arousing the people to fight a long-term war. Mr. Mallory added that if Japan wants to rule China, it must occupy the concessions, but the article claimed that General Chiang Kai-shek also welcomes this move, as it will increase the opportunity for the powers to aid China.

<h3>Two Batches of Twenty-Seven Japanese Planes Each Attacked Chongqing and Chengdu; Numerous Heavy Explosive Bombs Dropped in Chongqing; Losses in Chengdu Still Under Investigation; Rumor Has It That Five Were Shot Down</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Two batches of Japanese planes, twenty-seven in each batch, attacked Chongqing and Chengdu at around 7 PM today. In Chongqing, the Japanese planes entered the city's airspace at 7:15 PM, and after being met by the Chinese Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery, they dropped dozens of heavy explosive bombs indiscriminately before fleeing. In Chengdu, Japanese planes dropped many incendiary bombs, and the losses are under investigation. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) At around 7 PM this afternoon, twenty-seven Japanese planes attacked Chongqing. When the Japanese planes approached Chongqing's airspace, they engaged in a dogfight with the Chinese Air Force. Immediately after, they entered the city's airspace, and the Chinese anti-aircraft artillery units bombarded them fiercely. The Japanese planes did not dare to linger and fled after dropping bombs. The Chinese planes followed and pursued them until a certain location before safely returning to base. According to eyewitnesses, two Japanese planes were shot down, but the wreckage is still being searched for. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) Twenty-seven Japanese planes attacked Chengdu at 7:30 PM on the afternoon of the 11th. The Chinese Air Force bravely took off and attacked the Japanese planes repeatedly.

Several places in the city caught fire from the incendiary bombs, but they were all extinguished by midnight. West China University, run by British and American churches outside the South Gate, was also hit by three bombs, and two foreign professors were injured. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>First American Member of the Chinese Kuomintang Appointed as Organization Minister of the U.S. Branch</h3>
<p>(New York) The first American to join the Chinese Kuomintang is American dentist Morris William. He is currently the Organization Minister of the U.S. Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang. In addition to his duties, he raises funds for medical supplies. In 1921, William wrote a book entitled "Historical Social Explanation," the theories of which were largely cited by Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China. Sun Yat-sen refuted the materialistic view of history in his Three Principles of the People, drawing heavily from William's book. William was admired by Sun Yat-sen, and therefore developed a strong interest in China's national movement. In 1936, William was introduced by Wang Zhengting, the Chinese Ambassador to the United States, and became a member of the Kuomintang. According to William, Japan will never be able to destroy China. He also said that all countries in the world must treat China equally for their own benefit. If there is no help from China, the economic problems of all countries in the world cannot be solved. Finally, he said that if countries despise China's position, they will suffer the consequences themselves. For example, in 1931, countries originally planned to sacrifice China, but as a result, they only sacrificed the League of Nations. Although William is a member of the Chinese Kuomintang, he has not yet set foot on Chinese soil. It is said that he wishes to visit China this summer. (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

When the Japanese army retreated east, more than 20 trucks loaded with wounded Japanese soldiers left. A certain brigade of the Chinese army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese in Xuejiawan, east of Liulin. The Japanese army still occupies most of the Liucun area, and the Chinese army is vigorously besieging them. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Government Decides to Implement Materials Mobilization Plan; Promote Consumption Savings and Increase Production; Intensify Control Over the People, Causing Hardship</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Cabinet has decided on the national materials mobilization plan for this year. Although the detailed procedures are currently kept secret, it is generally believed that its characteristics are to vigorously expand the production of materials necessary for manufacturing munitions and developing Japanese export trade, and to intensify the control of the Japanese public's consumption of materials. The Miyako Shimbun reported that "The China Incident has caused the Japanese people to suffer greatly and feel many inconveniences. Fortunately, there is no shortage of food, because Japan can be self-sufficient. According to the new mobilization procedures, the control of many materials will be intensified, but if implemented carefully, it may not threaten the people. The previous allocation of materials was not smooth, causing friction in all aspects." (11th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Reviewing the Arguments for Peace</h3>
<p>A certain country's ambassador to China recently came to Shanghai from Chongqing and was asked about his impressions of Chongqing. He said: The National Government has been in charge of the war of resistance for more than twenty months, and its hardships and sufferings are unparalleled in history, but it is still full of vitality and its belief in victory is unwavering. This is the most profound impression, which was completely unexpected. Someone who went to the occupied areas to sweep graves and returned to Shanghai was asked about his impressions of the trip. He said: Traitors are colluding and plundering, and the residents are filled with grief and indignation, with no way to appeal. Therefore, those who in the past did not know what the nation was, and did not know the value of law and order, are now all able to realize the indivisibility of national destiny and interests, and are aware that the war of resistance for survival cannot be delayed. They only hope for the restoration of light. These two accounts allow us to glimpse the attitude of the Chinese government and people. However, at the same time as hearing these two accounts, I happened to see the arguments for peace in a Hong Kong newspaper, which made me deeply feel the great difference in people's hearts. Please review them:</p>
<p>When reviewing right and wrong, some people think that there is no absolute. However, the truth will never be erased because right and wrong may not be absolute. The difference between seeing benevolence and seeing wisdom, and the distinction between entering as master and serving as slave, may seem to be in opposition. However, fragrance and stench will never be neutralized because of opposition. Moreover, there are things that are absolute and not enough to oppose! Some people call it promoting peace, others call it surrendering. When Wang Jingwei used the peace movement as a slogan, the National Government denounced him as plotting against the government and ordered his arrest. This is something that is not enough to oppose. Why? By objectively reviewing his arguments for peace, even without adhering to the National Government, one can make such a judgment. He said: The truth of advocating peace lies in the displacement of refugees, the suffering of compatriots in the occupied areas, and the increasing loss of territory. Therefore, considering the current situation calmly and peacefully, the only option is to promote peace. He also said: There are two ways to achieve peace, namely international mediation and direct negotiations. Those who expect international mediation are entrusting the fate of the nation and the people to others, so direct negotiations are appropriate. He also said: Direct negotiations should begin with declarations from both sides, expressing sincerity to each other, and then cease hostilities and negotiate peace. He said: This is an unbreakable truth. His fundamental idea is the so-called "There is no war that does not end in peace."</p>
<p>"There is no war that does not end in peace." This is as accurate a truth as "There is no one who does not die." If this is taken as a truth without asking about the timing or the conditions, only seeking peace and only seeking death, in order to implement this truth, then it is a fallacy that everyone can understand, without the need for much explanation. Speaking of timing, there should be no fixed conclusion. However, the advocate of peace is describing the military disadvantage by saying "refugees are displaced, compatriots in the occupied areas are suffering, and more and more territory is being lost." When the military is at a disadvantage, it is the time to surrender, not the time to negotiate peace. Speaking of conditions, the purpose of the war of resistance is to have the other party abandon its aggression, while the intention of the advocate of peace is to abandon the war of resistance. If the other party does not abandon its aggression and this side first abandons the war of resistance, then this is a condition for surrender, not a condition for negotiating peace. Even in terms of the displacement of refugees, the focus should be on rescuing the refugees, not concluding with seeking peace. In terms of the suffering of compatriots in the occupied areas, the focus should be on restoring sovereignty and administration, not concluding with seeking peace. In terms of the increasing loss of territory, the focus should be on recovering the lost territory, and the current situation in Peiping and Nanjing is not what is meant by recovering lost territory. Is the advocate of peace considering this calmly and peacefully? To say today that the only option is to promote peace, will it preserve territorial sovereignty and administration? Given these points, since the arguments for peace lack truth, then the so-called ways to achieve peace are even less worth discussing. Following his argument, if the way of international mediation is to entrust the fate of the nation and the people to others, then today's Japan still regards itself as the victor, saying that China should entrust the fate of the nation and the people to Japan through direct negotiations? This is proven by the National Government's "vitality, unshakeable belief in the war of resistance," and further proven by the explicit order for Wang Jingwei's arrest. It can be known that the National Government will continue the war of resistance, has neither expected international mediation nor prepared for direct negotiations. The Japanese side has also repeatedly expressed that it will not take the National Government as its opponent. In that case, if the direct negotiations advocated by the advocate of peace do not first destroy China's political organization, they will have no way to implement the advocacy of direct negotiations. If they do not first obtain Japan's recognition as an opponent, they will have no way to realize direct negotiations. Thus, it can be said that the future envisioned by the advocate of peace is certainly not better than Peiping and Nanjing, and the content of the arguments for peace is certainly not right either.</p>
<h3>Guilin Wounded Soldiers' Friendship Society Holds General Meeting; Sends Telegram to Wounded Soldiers</h3>
<p>Guilin The Guilin Wounded Soldiers' Friendship Society held its first general meeting of members on the 10th and passed a telegram to pay tribute to the wounded soldiers throughout the country, stating that since the beginning of the war of resistance, we have relied on our loyal and brave soldiers to defend our country, and the achievements of more than twenty months of war have laid the foundation for final victory.

<h3>Chinese Tea Sells Well in Foreign Markets; Ministry of Finance Implements Control</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, according to official claims, the China National Foreign Trade Commission purchased 800,000 boxes of tea in 1938, and sales to markets in various countries accounted for half of the total. Another 264,000 boxes were shipped overseas to exchange for war and construction materials. The value of China's tea exports in 1938 exceeded 33 million yuan. The Foreign Trade Commission, under the order of the Ministry of Finance, controls all of China's tea and cooperates with the China National Tea Corporation to be responsible for purchasing and exporting in domestic markets. The China National Tea Corporation was established in May 1937 by Chinese bankers and tea merchants, with a capital of 2 million yuan. The Tea Commission had ordered 96,000 boxes of black brick tea and 48,000 boxes of green brick tea to be shipped to the Soviet Union. In addition, it purchased 6,800 boxes of silk tea, 1,500 boxes of black brick tea, and 1,500 boxes of three-sided brick tea to be shipped to the Soviet Union. It is said that the Soviet Union has ordered 200,500 more boxes of brick tea, but the commission was unable to fulfill the order because the war was approaching the brick tea producing areas on the border of Hubei and Hunan.

<h3>Chinese Guerrillas Bomb Changzhou Puppet Police Station; Observations of a Foreigner Residing in Changzhou; Japanese Army Ordered Many Cremation Boxes; Bridges on Highways Near Suzhou Destroyed</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that a certain foreigner residing in Changzhou on the Beijing-Shanghai line told reporters yesterday (the 10th) about the incident last Sunday night when a Chinese guerrilla team surrounded and bombed the Changzhou puppet police station. He was still living in Changzhou City at the time and heard the explosions. According to the foreigner, last Sunday night, the guerrillas sneaked into the key road about a quarter of a mile outside Changzhou City in front of the puppet police station. There were no Japanese soldiers around at the time, as it was late and the Japanese soldiers had all entered the city walls for protection. None of the puppet police were armed, so the guerrillas could do whatever they wanted. They surrounded them, and the guerrilla leader summoned the puppet police and said, "It is pitiful that you work for the Japanese. We will not kill you now, but we warn you that if we meet again, you will not be allowed to escape with your lives." After speaking, they set fire to the police station and bombed it. At 1:45 AM that night, the foreigner personally heard several terrible explosions. At the same time, the countryside between Beijing and Shanghai is becoming increasingly uneasy, especially in the Taihu Lake area. He has observed many signs of this unease. He said that he was deeply impressed by two major changes in the attitude of the Japanese soldiers: one is that the invaders seem to be increasingly violent towards the Chinese people, and the other is that the Japanese army is undoubtedly suffering more casualties and property damage than in the previous one or two months. The Japanese army has ordered many cremation boxes from Chinese carpenters, which is a sure sign that many more Japanese soldiers have been killed. The foreigner spoke with three carpenters who said that Japanese soldiers often came to order cremation boxes. Usually, only Japanese officers are cremated in boxes, so many Japanese soldiers must have been killed. As for the soldiers, they are cremated in piles, and after burning, the ashes are divided into boxes. The boxes used for the cremation of officers are made of thin wooden boards, which are supplied by the Japanese soldiers themselves. Chinese carpenters get eight jiao for each box. The small boxes for holding the ashes are also made of thin boards and cost two jiao each. Currently, many of the bridges on the roads have been partially or completely destroyed, which is another sign that the guerrillas are becoming more active. The foreigner saw five bridges burned and two damaged within eighteen kilometers of Suzhou last week. The road's bus service was suspended for several days. Gunfire can always be heard clearly in Changzhou City. The foreigner also believes that the Japanese troops between Changzhou and Yixing are being harassed severely. The Japanese army has no strong foothold in that mountainous area.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army in Northern Jiangsu Briefly Recaptured Tianchang</h3>
<p>Gaoyou Dispatch: Over a hundred Japanese and puppet troops who had been dispatched from Yangzhou to Xishan as reinforcements on May 27th, returned to Yangzhou at 4:00 PM. All the Japanese and puppet troops withdrawn from Xian and Shao were also sent back to their original defenses. Currently, there is no further contact in the Xishan area.</p>
<p>On the 26th, Tianchang was once attacked and briefly recaptured by the Chinese army. Many Japanese and puppet soldiers entrenched in Tianchang were killed by the Chinese forces.</p>
<p>At dawn on the 28th, a certain unit of the Chinese army set off from their defense area in two routes, towards Henan and Hebei, to attack the Japanese army at the Xiannv Temple. The Japanese army immediately responded with artillery fire from the east end of the Xiannv Temple, and indiscriminately fired machine guns. The contact lasted for two hours before stopping. The Japanese side consumed a large amount of ammunition. The Chinese army, having achieved its mission, safely returned to its defenses. The Japanese army, greatly alarmed by this attack, declared martial law around 8:00 AM and dispatched four to five disguised Japanese and puppet soldiers to scout the San Yuan Bridge outside the public road, to probe the movements of the Chinese army.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of the Guangdong Provincial Government's Mobilization Committee; Five Design Committees Established; Wartime Finances Also Perfected</h3>
<p>Shaoguan Dispatch: To strengthen the forces of resistance against Japan, the Guangdong Provincial authorities have reorganized and established the Provincial Mobilization Committee, perfecting its internal structure. Provincial Chairman Li Han-hun concurrently serves as the chairman. The committee has already held its first meeting, agreeing that modern warfare relies not solely on military strength, but the total sum of the nation's manpower, financial resources, and material resources. Guangdong Province, known for its wealth, can contribute the greatest strength to the nation if it can mobilize effectively. After careful deliberation, the mobilization plans for the province's manpower, financial resources, and material resources, as well as their sequential steps, have been largely decided. The work of the committee is proceeding with exceptional urgency. The first steps are to mobilize in five areas: culture, people's movement, economy, transportation, and defense. These five are closely related to military affairs and are urgent tasks at present. To ensure separate responsibilities and swift action, five design committees have been established, officially formed, and experts in each field have been hired as design committee members to plan various programs and submit them to relevant agencies for implementation. The selection of committee members and executive directors has also been finalized, and plans are underway to publish small series of books and organize mobilization work teams to strengthen the organizational structure of mobilization committees in various counties. The committee also considers the economy to be of utmost importance during the war of resistance, and therefore attaches great importance to economic mobilization. The Economic Design Committee has decided to widely hire experts to conduct detailed planning and design for the economic mobilization of the entire province. It has also stipulated that future work will be divided into five major areas of research to provide information for the government's relevant agencies to implement: 1. financial and monetary countermeasures; 2. food management; 3. trade and commodity control; 4. rural economic revitalization; 5. production. After all the experts have been hired, detailed implementation rules will be drafted and mobilization will be accelerated.</p>
<p>Corrupt County Magistrates to Be Severely Punished</p>
<p>The Provincial Government recently sent a report from the Provisional Assembly to various assembly members, requesting that those local officials who are unworthy be punished accordingly. It was immediately decided that, in addition to County Magistrate Li Ling-gen of Conghua, who will be dealt with in accordance with the resolution of the Provincial Assembly, former County Magistrate Chen Zhuo-lin of Sanshui and County Magistrate Zhang Hui of Zhongshan will also be prosecuted.</p>
<p>Wartime Finance Extremely Stable</p>
<p>In order to stabilize the wartime financial economy of Guangdong Province, the Provincial Department of Finance has, in accordance with the wartime financial stabilization policy, formulated implementation measures for the province, promulgated them to all counties, and earnestly implemented them. Since its implementation, the finance has been extremely stable. As for the finance of this province, since the outbreak of the war until now, the situation has been unusually stable. It is worth mentioning that: 1. Branch treasuries have been established in most counties, and those that have not been established are actively preparing for them. All county branch treasuries can remit various tax revenues to the county on schedule. However, due to the war, a portion of the collection has been delayed due to environmental factors, and efforts are being made to improve the situation. 2. The promotion of the national currency is being actively promoted. In addition to ordering all counties to strictly prohibit discrimination against the national currency, the department and the provincial bank have also announced to all merchants that all trade must be based on the national currency. All merchants have complied with this order, so the national currency is very popular in the inland counties. 3. The province buys up silver and prevents it from flowing out. After the abolition of silver buying offices in various counties, the task was changed to be handled by the provincial bank branches in each county, and personnel were dispatched to strictly investigate and deal with private smuggling for export. Therefore, the recent amount of silver purchased and remitted by various counties has been quite successful. In addition, measures to prevent the Japanese side from undermining financial policies have also been distributed to all counties for strict implementation. Therefore, the finance of this province is unusually stable. The aspect of finance arrangement can be divided into the following items: 1. Implementation of unified financial management authority for each county, and ordered the organization of a finance committee to assist in the arrangement. Now, the county finance committees have all been established uniformly. 2. Excessive and miscellaneous taxes in various counties have been actively abolished. Provincial and national taxes have also been separately designated. Those belonging to the national treasury are remitted by the county government to the Finance Department, and remitted to the central government in installments. Those belonging to the provincial treasury are remitted by the county tax authorities to the branch treasury, and remitted to the general treasury on schedule. 3. Since the provincial government approved the province's wartime administrative expenses and the expenses of the armed self-defense groups in the guerrilla areas under its jurisdiction, the province's financial revenue and expenditure have been quite suitable. The provincial authorities are still striving to save government expenses and eliminate excessive spending in order to enhance wartime finance.</p>

<h3>Rampant National Socialist Party; Tense German-Polish Relations; New Disputes Arise in Silesia Province; Danzig's Demands Rejected by Poland</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Responsible authorities recently announced that a group of National Socialist Party members from Ratiborwitz in German Silesia province broke into the Polish Association of Overseas Residents in Germany last night, destroying furniture, tearing up a photo of former Polish Minister of Military Affairs and General Pilsudski, and taking away various documents. Afterwards, German authorities closed the association and allocated it as the office for the National Socialist Party Youth League. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The Senate of the Free City of Danzig previously sent a note to the Polish government on the 3rd of this month, requesting that the number of Polish customs officials in the city's customs office be reduced, and that all customs officials in office swear allegiance to the city senate. Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, recently sent a Polish reply to the Chairman of the City Senate, Gletzer, rejecting the request, stating that this matter is solely within the jurisdiction of the Polish government and cannot be interfered with by the city senate. Polish rights and interests are guaranteed by the existing agreements between Poland and Danzig, and Poland is determined to protect them. Should the city senate violate existing agreements, such as reducing the number of Polish customs officials or restricting their authority, economic retaliation will be taken. (Note: The appointment and removal of customs officials in the city of Danzig is determined by the Polish government, as stated in the Paris Agreement of November 9, 1920, but the number is not specified.) (Havas dispatch, 10th) The Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, recently rejected the note submitted by the city senate, and this has been fiercely criticized by newspapers here as evidence of Poland's deliberate threat to the city of Danzig. The semi-official German News Agency quoted a comment saying, "Poland is unwilling to settle the Danzig issue peacefully and wants to create incidents by various means, as can be seen from this reply." The local "Guidance Newspaper" stated, "Polish customs officials are all armed and are actually economic spies." (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>New Crisis Brewing in Europe; British Policy Encourages Aggression</h3>
<p>(London) British-German relations have recently been commented on by various newspapers. The "Sunday Express" reported that the British Cabinet believes that Germany's expressed wishes can be satisfied by peaceful means, and is planning to convene an international conference to discuss various outstanding issues, including colonial issues, which are often discussed. It is also planning to propose that major powers first limit their armaments in order to create a favorable environment for the success of the conference. However, Germany, based on past experiences, may be emboldened and take tough actions in the Free City of Danzig or elsewhere in response to Britain's peaceful overtures. The British authorities are aware of this and are taking various steps to inform Germany that if there are any further acts of aggression, they are determined to resist by force. Diplomatic circles here believe that the European situation may experience another crisis in the coming weeks. As for what constitutes a crisis, whether it is limited to issuing strong declarations or whether it will involve further actions, will depend on the circumstances. "Picture Weekly" reported that Prime Minister Chamberlain still believes that both Chancellor Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini can be persuaded to participate in an international conference with gentle words and economic benefits, and is prepared to make all sacrifices to maintain peace and plans to use the appeasement policy as a campaign platform in the upcoming general election. However, certain cabinet members are deeply afraid that the appeasement policy means continuing to make concessions to various dictatorships. Prime Minister Chamberlain may listen to Germany's control of Poland, or even make concessions to Germany on colonial issues in order to win over Chancellor Hitler, and therefore strongly oppose it. In addition, the leaders of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force all insisted on dissenting, saying that if Britain makes concessions to Germany on colonial issues, it would be tantamount to suicide from a military perspective.

<h3>Britain and France Plan Joint Proposal; Negotiations on Tripartite Agreement; Differences Not Difficult to Eliminate</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, French Ambassador to Britain Corbin met with Foreign Office official Sir Cadogan this morning to propose new suggestions on the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic states. Experts from the British Foreign Office immediately studied them, trying to reconcile the views of Britain and France in order to formulate a joint proposal and hand it over to Mr. Strang, the Director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, to bring to Moscow. The official arena is keeping the content of the French proposal a secret, but it is said to be very simple and clear, advocating that when the interests crucial to the Soviet Union's survival are threatened, the Soviet Union can decide for itself whether it is necessary to implement the mutual assistance agreement. If so, the objections raised by the Soviet Union to the original proposals of Britain and France would no longer be valid. (Havas dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Mr. Strang, Director of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, will travel to Moscow on the 12th of this month to assist Ambassador Seeds in negotiating with the Soviet authorities on the issue of a mutual assistance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Various newspapers here believe that Mr. Strang's main task on this trip is to earnestly explain the issue of guaranteeing the Baltic states and earnestly persuade the Soviet authorities to accept the proposals put forward by Britain and France. The "Observer" newspaper reported, "The French government submitted several methods to the British government yesterday that could solve the current difficulties, which will be brought to Moscow by Strang to study with the Soviet government one by one, in order to satisfy the country's wishes while allaying the doubts of the Baltic states. The most promising method is for Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to use the guarantee that Britain provides to Poland as a blueprint to conclude a treaty of alliance in which the three signatory countries mutually guarantee each other's territorial integrity and implement mutual assistance when threatened directly or indirectly. If this method is adopted, the Baltic states can maintain their neutrality in peacetime. If Germany seeks to pass through these countries to attack the Soviet Union, then its interests will be the same as those of the Soviet Union, and there will be a need for joint defense, and there is no need to explicitly mention the names of these countries in the tripartite agreement."

<h3>French Prime Minister Praises Russian Military Achievements; Statue of Joffre Unveiled; Presided Over the Unveiling Ceremony</h3>
<p>(Paris) The statue of General Joffre, who commanded the Allied forces in France at the beginning of the European War, was unveiled yesterday by French Prime Minister Daladier in Champoultry. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Prime Minister Daladier gave a speech yesterday at the unveiling ceremony of the monument to the late General Joffre, and expressed great appreciation for the actions of the Russian army during the European War. The French Prime Minister used theoretical methods to prove the necessity of signing a military alliance with the Soviet Union, and praised the assistance of the Russian army at a certain stage of the Great War. He said, "We can still recall that when the Battle of the Marne began, the Russian army restrained the main force of the German army on the plains of East Prussia." His criticism was highly valued because France has historically condemned Russia's "betrayal" at Brest-Litovsk. Daladier's criticism reflects the opinion of the French General Staff, which believes that it is necessary for the Soviet Union to deal with a large number of German troops in the East in the event of a major war.

<h3>Czech Bohemia and Moravia Provinces; Protection System Coming to an End; Will Be Formally Incorporated into German Territory; Slovak Independence is Just a Name</h3>
<p>(Paris) Newspapers here recently reported that Germany's protection system for the provinces of Bohemia and Moravia in the Czech Republic is coming to an end, and they will be directly incorporated into German territory. The "Radical Socialist Party Business Report" stated that the annexation date will be before the 15th of this month, at which time the provinces will become German provinces and be directly administered by the central government of Germany. Czech cultural autonomy will cease from then on. The current Czech courts will no longer exist, and all officials will be replaced by Germans. It is decided that the independent Slovak state will also encounter the same fate. Foreign observers in Berlin have already submitted reports to their respective governments.

<h3>Ethnic Hatred; Conflicts Frequently Heard</h3>
<p>Prague: Although every effort has been made to prevent conflicts between Czechs and Germans in various parts of the Czech Republic, they still occur frequently and increase the tension between the two ethnic groups. While the incident of the murder of a German police officer in the Klatno area is still under investigation, a fight between Czech and German police officers broke out in Nachod in northern Bohemia yesterday, resulting in the death of one Czech police officer. The German and Czech authorities are now jointly investigating. According to the announcement, this mutual fight is the result of an accumulation of regrettable events. German Protector Neurath has ordered a strict investigation, and all those involved have been arrested. The Czech Prime Minister visited German State Secretary Frank yesterday to express the Czech government's apology for the Klatno incident and stated that the Czech authorities will do their best to apprehend the murderers. As a result of this meeting, the German authorities decided not to temporarily implement the plan announced yesterday to deal with Klatno. Therefore, measures such as fining 500,000 crowns as discussed yesterday, prohibiting night travel from 8:00 PM to 5:00 AM, closing all cinemas, schools, and public places, and closing all doors and windows along the street, will not be implemented for the time being. Neurath has recently issued an announcement stating that in view of the results of the investigation into the attitude of the Czech people and the plans adopted by the Czech Protectorate government, the German Protector will temporarily not implement the special measures that had been planned earlier. The official arena believes that the rumors of hundreds of arrests are not accurate. (Reuters dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>Prague: Regarding the incident of the German policeman being shot and killed, 263 citizens of Klatno have been arrested. Neurath, the German Governor of Bohemia and Moravia, announced that all restrictions and precautions in the area have been lifted. Although the real murderer has not yet been found among those arrested, Neurath believes that the people of the area can maintain order, so there is no need for precautions. Although two German police officers were shot at yesterday, the tense situation has indeed eased. It is said that the German police officers retaliated at the time, but it is not known whether there were any casualties. It is reported that of the 163 people arrested, 110 were Czech police officers, whose crime was dereliction of duty. As for the other arrested people, they are communists and supporters of the former Czech president. (Associated Press dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>Countries Around the World Compete to Expand Their Air Forces; The United States Should Catch Up; Germany Currently Has the Greatest Strength; Colonel Lindbergh Calls Attention</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Air Force Colonel Lindbergh told friends that he believes a European war will not break out immediately. According to those close to Colonel Lindbergh, Lindbergh has been focusing on inspecting and investigating Army aviation affairs since returning to the United States from Europe. Colonel Lindbergh is promoting to influential people in the aviation industry that if the United States does not accelerate its aviation development program, the U.S. Air Force will lag behind Germany by at least five years. Colonel Lindbergh ranks Germany as number one in terms of the number of aircraft. He believes that once the U.S. aviation development program begins, the United States can use mass production methods to surpass Germany in the number of aircraft. As for France, it plans to increase the number of aircraft purchased in the United States to more than 1,200. France has already signed a contract to purchase 800 U.S. aircraft. France originally wanted to buy another 800, but currently can only add less than 500. A French military inspection team, currently led by Quartermaster General Major General Cavert, is traveling around the United States for the purpose of purchasing military supplies. According to unofficial but authoritative Army statistics, France ranks only fifth in the competition to build air forces in Europe. The number of first-line aircraft in the French Army does not exceed 2,200. The strength of the air forces of other European countries is as follows: Germany has 9,500 aircraft, the Soviet Union has 6,100, Italy has 4,800, and Britain has 3,300. Colonel Lindbergh ranks the strength of the European air forces as follows: Germany ranks first, Britain and France together rank second, and Italy ranks third. He said that he is not familiar with the aviation strength of the Soviet Union. (Associated Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) A report by the Foreign Policy Association recently stated that the large-scale manufacture of military aircraft in the United States may not necessarily be due to urgent national defense needs, but the policies of European democracies may be changed as a result. Mr. Popper, a researcher at the association, also stated that it would be a foolish attempt for European and Asian countries to launch an air raid on the Western Hemisphere, as the U.S. air defense capabilities have greatly increased.

<h3>Japanese Ships Use Fishing as a Cover; Spying on U.S. Warship Movements; Considered to Contain Espionage; U.S. Naval Authorities Order Them to Sail Away</h3>
<p>San Pedro: Seven Japanese fishing boats at the San Clemente Island naval training base were ordered by the U.S. Navy to leave the island and sail east today. After the U.S. fleet returned from the Atlantic to the Pacific, during the first exercise at sea, it was seen that the Japanese fishing boats were paying special attention to the movements of U.S. warships, so they were forced to return to Japan to fish. The fishing boats had been engaged in shrimping in the Gulf of California for three years. The actions taken by the Navy are part of the work of the U.S. federal government recently conducted on the west coast of the United States for national defense purposes to crack down on foreign espionage activities.

<h3>Axis Powers of Germany and Italy Covet Spain's Rich Resources, Hoping to Obtain Special Political and Economic Benefits as Compensation for Participating in the Spanish Civil War</h3>
<p>(London) Germany and Italy are each exerting their efforts, hoping to turn the assistance they provided to General Franco during the Spanish Civil War into special economic and political benefits. Hitler, with this aim in mind, has dispatched his Minister of Economics, Herr Huldtart, to Spain. Simultaneously, Italian Foreign Minister Ciano is also in Rome, holding talks with Spanish Interior Minister Suñer. It is said that the purpose of these talks is to arrange the preliminary conclusion of commercial, economic, and political agreements, with the aim of eventually drawing Spain into the Axis. It is expected that Ciano will travel to Madrid at the end of this month to sign such agreements. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini yesterday received Suñer and Spanish army personnel at the Palazzo Venezia. Subsequently, Mussolini and Franco exchanged telegrams, declaring eternal friendship between the two countries. Berlin believes that the mission of German Minister of Economics Huldtart is extremely important to German industry. It is said that Huldtart's mission to Madrid is to establish concrete commercial relations with Spain. Germany is most interested in Spain's minerals, especially its iron ore, hoping to obtain concessions from Spain for establishing steel mills and mining iron ore on the spot. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Spanish Interior Minister Suñer has been holding important talks with Italian authorities here for several days. As soon as Foreign Minister Ciano returns from his reciprocal visit to Leão, the two sides will sign a political and economic agreement. The Nationalist government owes Italy a debt amounting to 800 million lira. Italy will naturally seek to participate in the development of Spanish resources as a means of compensation. In addition, Spain will not sign a military agreement with Italy to avoid completely joining the German-Italian Axis, or it is possible that only secondary agreements will be concluded by the general staffs of both sides.

<h3>Copyright Lawsuit over "Mein Kampf": Hitler Wins</h3>
<p>(New York) "Mein Kampf," written by German leader Adolf Hitler, was recently translated into English and published by an American publishing company. Several thousand copies have already been sold, and the company has donated the royalties due to the German Government Relief Fund for Exiles. Because the translation was not authorized, Leader Hitler entrusted the Mifflin Publishing Company as its representative to file a lawsuit in this court. The defendant argued that Leader Hitler had lost his Austrian citizenship and could not invoke Austrian copyright. The presiding judge believed that if this precedent were set, all stateless authors would suffer, so he ruled that all unsold copies of the translation should be impounded. (Havas, 10th)</p>

In addition to 58 battalions of the Western University armed forces, there were also 2,000 National Guardsmen. The British King and Queen's car traveled at high speed (45 miles per hour). Later, because the British Queen complained that the car was traveling too fast and they could not see the crowds, Mayor La Guardia ordered the car to slow down to 20 miles per hour. Furthermore, the Roosevelt family had arrived here before the British King and Queen to make all welcome preparations. (Associated Press, 11th)</p>
<p>Four Million People Admired Their Grace</p>
<p>When the New York reached Manhattan Island on the USS Warrington destroyer, the welcome was far greater than that of Colonel Lindbergh's triumphal return to the country in 1927. It is estimated that no fewer than four million people in New York, in 90-degree weather, competed to see the King and Queen, etc. When New York State Governor Lehman introduced the members of the welcoming committee and New York City Mayor La Guardia shook hands with the King, the police band played the American and British anthems, and the 100,000+ onlookers near the docks cheered loudly, paying their respects to the King and Queen, etc. A total of 13 cars were in the motorcade, the King and Queen riding in the first car. 42 police officers rode motorcycles, acting as guides in front of the car. After passing through the never-ending crowds cheering along the 50-mile route, they went directly to the World's Fair. In addition to plainclothes policemen, 15,000 police officers took care of the crowds. One million+ children waved the British and American flags, cheering as if they were one family. The King raised his hand to thank them, and the Queen nodded and smiled in return. When the motorcade arrived at the World's Fair, a 21-gun salute was fired. The Fairgrounds had been crowded with spectators an hour earlier; there had never been such a grand occasion since the opening of the Fair. Police put up security lines everywhere. The King and Queen, etc., entered the elevator to the second-floor reception room to meet with the heads of the various pavilions and members of the city government. After lunch, they briefly visited the Irish and Canadian pavilions, then entered the British pavilion. At the entrance, fireworks were set off, and tens of thousands of British and American flags fell from the sky. Boy Scouts and others picked them up to commemorate the King and Queen's visit. After touring the British pavilion, the King and Queen appeared on the lawn and mingled with the invited guests. The King looked slightly tired, but the Queen showed no signs of fatigue. American, Canadian, and British veterans stood at attention to salute as the King, etc., left the pavilion. The King spoke a few words with one or two white-bearded old soldiers. By this time, the itinerary was already 40 minutes behind schedule. The King, etc., then drove off to Columbia University amid the cheers of the crowd. The president of the university gave a welcoming speech. According to Police Commissioner Valentine's estimate, there were often three million people who saw the motorcade pass by on the road from the Battery on Manhattan Island to the World's Fair.

<p>The Royal Carriage Enters the World's Fair Venue</p>
<p>King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England arrived in New York this morning on the USS Warrington destroyer from Le Havre, Maryland. The USS Warrington arrived offshore at 11:19 a.m., and the crowds on shore cheered loudly. The British flag was also raised at the same time. A few minutes later, the ship docked, and New York State Governor Lehman, Mayor La Guardia, and British Consul General Haggard here, each with his wife, stepped forward to greet them, presenting the Queen with huge bouquets of flowers and respectfully leading the King and Queen ashore to board specially prepared cars. At this time, the people shouted "Long live" and at 11:30, the motorcade set off, with 75 mounted police officers and 25 police officers on motorcycles escorting them on both sides. However, due to the crowds along the way, the car moved very slowly. People threw colored paper wherever it passed, and large groups of elementary school students waved British and American flags along the road. By the time they arrived at the World's Fair, it was 12:38 p.m., and a 21-gun salute was fired to pay respects. Then, a team of Indians from Kansas led the motorcade into the venue to the grand auditorium, where Fair President Whalen and his wife hosted a reception, introduced key Fair personnel, and met with the King and Queen, along with representatives from various countries. The Italian representative raised his hand in a Fascist salute, which drew criticism from many people in attendance. The motorcade then turned to tour various parts of the venue in light rain. The people cheered enthusiastically wherever they went, and the King and Queen smiled in response. Later, many young Scotsmen, dressed in their traditional attire, played Scottish folk songs to entertain the Queen (who is a Scottish aristocrat). The King and Queen then got out of the car in front of the American pavilion, where no fewer than 100,000 spectators were nearby, and 1,000 American soldiers and sailors lined up to welcome them and were inspected by the King and Queen. The outgoing couple of the American pavilion, the Frys, immediately cordially invited them to a purely American-style lunch. After the meal, the King and Queen went out onto the terrace, where 5,000 children sang the British national anthem. Then, they went to the Canadian pavilion, where they were accompanied by Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King on a tour. They also made brief stops at the South African, Australian, and New Zealand pavilions. Finally, they arrived at the British headquarters pavilion, where Sir Peel, the British representative of the Fair, welcomed them as usual. At 3:50 p.m., they left for Columbia University. The route of the motorcade was mostly through areas inhabited by black people, where they enthusiastically cheered and paid their respects wherever they went. The journey took about three quarters of an hour to reach Columbia University, where 5,000 students lined up at the school gate to welcome them. President Butler personally greeted them and asked the King and Queen to sign their names as a souvenir. It was not until 5:17 p.m. that they changed to a black sedan and drove to Hyde Park in the drizzling rain. At 7:41 p.m., they arrived at President Roosevelt's private residence and were entertained by the President and his wife. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>American Congressman Calls British King "Cousin"</p>

<h3>Scientific Exploration in Dutch New Guinea: Discovery of Stone Age Tribe</h3>
<p>Bandung, Java: A year ago, a team of eight Americans, six Dutch, and one Canadian, representing the New York Museum of Natural History, went to Dutch New Guinea for scientific research. The Dutch government sent a troop of soldiers to escort them along the way. They departed from Java to New Hollandia on the northern coast of New Guinea, and then entered the Wilhelmina Mountains and the Idan River area in the interior. They first used a giant plane that could hold more than 20 people to conduct a survey that lasted a whole year before returning here. It is said that they have discovered a large Stone Age tribe, which is the most interesting anthropological discovery. The tribe has 60,000 people, who had never seen white people before the arrival of the expedition. Their utensils are all made of stone, and the language they speak is unintelligible to others. They fight with neighboring tribes, and eating enemies raw is the reward for victory. However, they are quite friendly to explorers and are willing to exchange sweet potatoes and pigs for shells. When they first saw the expedition approaching, they hid in the forest. After gradually becoming familiar with them, they dared to return to the village. They live in round houses and engage in cultivation in their primitive way. The sweet potatoes they produce are enough to meet their needs. The expedition urgently wanted to obtain some stone tools and offered steel and axes in exchange, but they were not interested in them. In the first few weeks, the two sides mostly used gestures to communicate. Before long, the explorers gradually began to understand this strange language. The tribe has not yet been named, but the people of New Guinea all call them the Besqi. This expedition has collected previously unknown species of birds and mammals, and it is said that these specimens may indicate a close relationship between New Guinea and the Australian continent. The American member of the expedition may take a plane back to the United States via Europe. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<h3>The Impact of Molotov's Speech London Airmail: Small Countries Threatened with Security Sympathize with the Soviet Union; Anglo-Soviet Negotiations Still Awaiting a Suitable Method</h3>
<p>— Uncle Di</p>
<p>Molotov's speech was eagerly awaited here. Before its release, the public opinions of Britain and France unanimously declared that the Anglo-French proposal was one that the Soviet Union must accept if it sincerely wished to unite with Britain and France. However, in reality, if you were to discuss it with more insightful observers, they would quietly tell you the "truth": "It would be strange if the Soviet Union accepted it like that!"</p>
<p>Then, on the evening of May 31st, Molotov delivered his speech on Soviet foreign policy in Moscow. The Soviet Union did not accept the Anglo-French proposal, but neither did it reject it. Thus, the British and French authorities were temporarily left with a conundrum. Until the Soviet government's official reply arrived, the British and French authorities were unable to decide on their next step.</p>
<p>In the past two days, the British and French newspapers generally seem to have a rather optimistic impression of this speech. The majority of opinions asserted that the Soviet Union's willingness to unite with Britain and France was undoubtedly a major premise; the current problem was only the conditions and methods. Therefore, in their view, Molotov's speech was merely a tightening of the Soviet Union's diplomatic tactics, aimed at seeking more favorable terms of exchange.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy point in the speech was the emphasis on the Soviet Union's Far Eastern policy and the public declaration of support for China's war of resistance. After Eden's resignation, the collective security system in Europe collapsed. Over the past year or so, the general impression has been that if the European part and the Far Eastern part of the Soviet Union's foreign policy were placed on the two ends of a scale, the Far Eastern part would be heavier. And this Molotov speech is strong evidence of that.</p>
<p>Not long ago, some people said that the Soviet Union today is more accurately described as an Asian power than a European power. Now, after hearing Molotov's speech, the concerns of those who thought that the Soviet Union might relax its firm position in the Far East due to the increasing pressure from Germany and Italy in Europe seem to have been completely dispelled.</p>
<p>As for the negotiations on cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, of course, they will continue. The main reason is that if they were abandoned at this stage, the harm to Britain and France would be unimaginable, much worse than if it had never happened in the first place. Fundamentally, today's European environment dictates that cooperation between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union must arise at this time. These points have already been made in previous dispatches. What needs to be pointed out now are the two most important events in the European situation during the week or so surrounding Molotov's speech.</p>
<p>The Last Struggle of Chamberlain's Cabinet's Diplomatic Path</p>
<p>British Prime Minister Chamberlain has been in office for nearly three years. Since last year, when British domestic politics have been subject to fluctuations due to diplomacy, news of his intention to retire has been repeatedly reported. However, last week, this news was confirmed: he has decided to retire completely to the countryside next year after the formation of the new government following the general election in November this year, and no longer interfere in politics. However, in the months before his retirement, he still has two things to accomplish: one is how to maintain the Conservative Party's inherent position in the next government, and the other is how to "maintain peace in Europe." In recent days, internal activities and arrangements in Britain have been very tense. Although purely domestic affairs, there is no need to discuss them here; however, there are two points to be pointed out where domestic politics are related to diplomacy: first, those around Chamberlain's inner circle believe that as long as there is another crisis in Europe, another Munich-style conference, then the Conservative Party's position will be very dangerous in the general election; second, the only effective way to prevent a new crisis is undoubtedly a flexible Anglo-French-Soviet "alliance against aggression." The focus of these two points is still on domestic politics, with diplomacy being merely a means. This is also considered one of the reasons why people in Britain who have always opposed being close to the Soviet Union have suddenly changed their attitudes in this Anglo-French-Soviet cooperation negotiation. However, the purpose of the "Chamberlain Cabinet" is not limited to this. It also has its own diplomatic path.</p>
<p>What is the "Chamberlain Cabinet's" diplomatic path? The first step is to completely resolve the contradictions between Britain and France and Germany and Italy. The second step is to sign a "Four-Power Pact." The third step is to reorganize the League of Nations, kick out the Soviet Union, or even create an anti-communist army. The various dreams of this path, even in Britain, have long been ridiculed or even forgotten. However, on the eve of Chamberlain's departure, as a last gasp, he still wants to make a final attempt.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to the recent plans of Chamberlain's close confidants, if the Soviet Union had accepted the Anglo-French proposal this week, then what would have followed immediately would not have been concrete sanctions against aggression, but rather the start of "adjusting diplomatic relations" with Germany and Italy.</p>
<p>As for the method of "adjustment," according to the current plans of these people, it would probably be based on Britain, France, and the Soviet Union (with the necessary addition of the United States) as the main initiators, inviting Germany and Italy to hold an international conference to engage in various discussions, preceded by contacts between Britain and Germany.</p>
<p>Naturally, this planned "contact," if successful, could at any time change direction again, leading to the path of the "Four-Power Pact," and returning to the old path of the "Chamberlain Cabinet." Because, according to Chamberlain's idea, in this "contact," Britain must tell Germany, and make her believe, that Britain has absolutely no intention of "attacking" her, and that everything is for "defense"; in other words, as long as Germany and Italy do not hinder the main interests of Britain and France, everything can still be discussed to satisfy Germany and Italy's "desires." From this, it can be inferred that not only can the results of past aggression be recognized, but even the survival of some other small countries can also be within the scope of discussion.</p>
<p>The intention of this Molotov speech, which re-emphasized collective security and upheld Stalin's principle of aiding all countries fighting for their independence, was to address this point. In the eyes of all small countries in Europe whose security is threatened, the reputation and credibility of the Soviet Union, compared to those of Britain and France, are becoming the opposite, rising and falling.</p>
<p>German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's New Plan</p>
<p>Since the Munich Conference last year, Ribbentrop's reputation in Germany has been very high: his assessment of the British situation was even more accurate than Hitler himself! Hitler believed that he surpassed everyone in all aspects, but he was still hesitant about demanding the cession of the Sudetenland because he was worried about offending Britain. However, from the beginning, Ribbentrop advised him not to be afraid to go further and simply demand the cession, because Britain would never go to war for this, and on the contrary, would be afraid of the outbreak of war and act as a mediator to give it to Germany. Hearing this, Hitler was hesitating; however, within a few days, an editorial appeared in The Times, representing the British government, openly advocating the cession of the Sudetenland. After that, Hitler would ask this "expert on Britain" about events involving Britain. Therefore, Hitler dared to brazenly occupy Czechoslovakia in March this year because Ribbentrop had completely calculated the possible reaction of Britain in advance. After several such incidents, his position in Germany today is second only to Hitler and Göring, making him the third most important person.</p>
<p>Such an important figure, while Hitler is temporarily silent due to the uncertain outcome of the Anglo-French-Soviet cooperation negotiations, has drafted a future expansion plan for him.</p>
<p>The specific content of this new plan put forward by Ribbentrop is still unknown. However, its general gist, based on what is already known, can be divided into two parts. The most important is the part about the basis of the argument, which probably has three points: Any large-scale German expansion plan must be put forward when the current British cabinet is in power, while Chamberlain, its "peace envoy," has not yet stepped down; Future actions do not necessarily involve mobilizing troops and generals; All preparations must be completed before the Nuremberg Nazi Party Congress in September. As for the specific plan, it is still limited to Southeastern Europe, the Mediterranean, and the Near East, and does not include Ukraine in the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Now Molotov's speech has been delivered. Once the Soviet government's official reply arrives in the next few days, Britain and France will probably take further action. It seems that the fundamental abandonment of the negotiations is unlikely; the problem is the method of future negotiations and the determination of Britain and France to sanction aggression. Determination is the fundamental problem, and Britain and France must make a big decision, but even if they have determination, it will still not work without a suitable method of negotiation. In the current situation, there is still a considerable distance between the Soviet Union and Britain and France in terms of determination; and given the lack of trust between the current governments of Britain and the Soviet Union, what method can be used to satisfactorily achieve the task of understanding? This is also a considerable obstacle to the current Anglo-Soviet negotiations. At present, some people in Britain have also noticed this problem and are discussing remedies. There are probably two new methods that are most generally supported: first, to achieve a satisfactory understanding through a third country, such as Turkey; second, more direct private contact between British and French authorities and Soviet authorities. With this as the goal, even the matter of Halifax and Bonnets seeking an opportunity to negotiate with Potemkin is now being discussed by everyone. However, all these plans are not yet mature, and other new methods are also constantly being proposed, so it is not yet time to draw conclusions.</p>

<h3>Overview of Vocational Education in China (4): Promulgation of Regulations for Midwifery Nurse Schools; Compilation and Review of Teaching Materials for Various Subjects in Vocational Schools</h3>
<p>Achievements Exhibition</p>
<p>In order to examine the performance of vocational schools nationwide and to provide opportunities for mutual observation and improvement among the schools, the Ministry of Education held an exhibition of achievements of vocational schools and labor courses in primary and secondary schools in the capital in December of the 23rd year. The scope of solicited exhibits was divided into two categories, A and B. Category A was the main exhibits, including students' practical achievements, working drawings, and students' achievements and working drawings from labor courses in primary and secondary schools. Category B was the supplementary exhibits, including achievements of educational administrative organs, school achievements, and teaching achievements. A total of 1,513 schools from 30 provinces and cities participated in this exhibition. The types of schools exhibiting included 169 vocational schools, 337 middle schools, 139 normal schools, and 868 primary schools. The types of exhibits totaled 43 categories, with a total of 30,955 items. The Ministry invited experts to serve as judges, who believed that the overall achievements showed progress. The points that should be improved in the future have been communicated to the provinces and cities for them to follow and improve.</p>
<p>In December of the 23rd year, the Ministry of Education took the opportunity of holding the exhibition of achievements of vocational schools and labor courses in primary and secondary schools nationwide to convene vocational education personnel in charge of educational administrative organs in various provinces and cities, and also wrote to the National Economic Council, the Construction Committee, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Communications, and the National Academic Work Advisory Office, inviting them to send representatives to hold a national vocational education discussion meeting. Representatives from various ministries and commissions and provinces and cities raised issues based on the actual situation of vocational education and discussed them together to seek solutions. At the same time, the Ministry invited domestic experts with rich experience in vocational education to give lectures on various issues of vocational guidance. A total of 52 proposals were submitted by the provinces and cities, and 14 essential cases were resolved, all of which were the most important matters in vocational education administration. The Ministry of Education separately organized and selectively implemented them.</p>
<p>Consolidating Medical Education</p>
<p>Midwifery and nursing schools are related to the health of mothers and the general public. Previously, there were few dedicated schools. By the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education investigated privately established midwifery schools, of which there were more than 100. It then joined with the Ministry of Interior to form a midwifery education committee, responsible for planning and drafting temporary standards for the school system and curriculum of midwifery schools. By the 24th year of the Republic of China, there were a total of 367 midwifery and nursing schools in various places. Experts were hired to formulate and promulgate curriculum standards for the two types of schools, and two types of provisional regulations for senior midwifery and nursing vocational schools were promulgated, stipulating the level of students and the length of study. At the same time, a specialized committee on midwifery and nursing education was organized to plan everything, supervise and promote.</p>
<p>In the 25th year, in order to unify the graduation level of midwifery and nursing schools, the regulations for the screening examination and graduation examination of midwifery and nursing schools were specially announced, but they were temporarily suspended due to the outbreak of the War of Resistance.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Notifies Schools to Reduce Vaccination to Once</h3>
<p>The Health Department of the Public Concession Bureau, in order to prevent epidemics during the summer season, has publicly administered vaccinations. It has paid close attention to schools and has assigned specialists to be in charge. In previous years, it was customary for the department to give two vaccinations to each school. This year, due to the increase in the number of schools in the concession and the fact that the number of students has exceeded previous years by five or six times, the prepared vaccine is insufficient, so it has been decided to reduce the number of vaccinations per school to one. The Health Department has notified the schools in conjunction with the Education Department.</p>

<h3>Thirteen Mile Charity Marathon Race: Wang Zhenglin Wins Championship in 1 Hour, 6 Minutes, 34 Seconds</h3>
<p>The first Sino-Western Open Thirteen-Mile, One Hundred Ninety-Three Yard Charity Marathon Race, organized by the Hongkou Cross-Country Team, started at 6:30 yesterday morning at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road. A total of one hundred forty-seven people registered, but sixty people dropped out, so only eighty people actually showed up. Famous athletes such as Guan Youwen, Bi Si, Zhang Liang, and Ling Xuewen were absent, which reduced the excitement considerably. After the start, cars were dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department to lead the way, and the crowds of spectators along the route numbered over ten thousand, a scene of unprecedented splendor. In the end, Wang Zhenglin won first place with a time of 1 hour, 6 minutes, 34 seconds. After the race, Zhou Jiaqi presented the awards. Wang Zhenglin received the Yuan Ludeng Award for first place, Liu Guangfa received the Chen Jicheng Award for second place, Huang Jinfu received the Gao Huaide Award for third place, Lin Guoyou received the Gao Huailiang Award for fourth place, Li Duan received the Xu Xiaochu Award for fifth place, Ma Riji received the Zhou Bangjun Award for sixth place, and Geli Mengsi received the Yousheng Travel Group Award for seventh place. According to the above prizes, due to the charitable nature of the event, all were converted into cash donations and have been delivered to the Refugee Relief Association. Details of the event are as follows:</p>
<p>Start</p>
<p>At 6:30, participants gathered at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Tongfu Road for the start. Hua Xu gave the starting signal, and with the sound of a silver whistle, Wang Zhenglin, with his experienced skill, broke out first. Liu Guangfa, Huang Jinfu, Lin Guoyou, and Geli Mengsi followed closely behind. Ma Riji, Zhou Ruquan, and Wan Jinsheng lagged behind by ten meters. After running Jing'an Temple Road and turning into Yuyuan Road, Wang Zhenglin led from afar. Liu Guangfa suddenly accelerated at this time, darting through the crowd and gradually closing in on Wang Zhenglin. Wang Jinfu and Lin Guoyou remained in the middle of the pack, trailing by thirty meters. Wan Jinsheng and Geli Mengsi were another fifty meters behind. By the time they reached Zhaofeng Garden, the rankings remained the same.</p>
<p>Midway</p>
<p>On Triumph Road, Wang Zhenglin had already left Liu Guangfa forty meters behind. At this time, Huang Jinfu, Li Duan, Ma Riji, and Lin Guoyou were neck and neck. After passing Dunxin Road, Wang and Liu maintained their original positions. Upon reaching Daxilu, two-fifths of the entire journey had been completed. The racers were invigorated at this point. Wang Zhenglin still left Liu Guangfa forty meters behind, while Huang and Lin advanced shoulder to shoulder. Li was another forty meters behind, while Geli Mengsi and Wan Jinsheng competed fiercely. After traversing Difeng Road, crossing Jing'an Temple Road, and returning to Yuyuan Road, then Triumph Road, and Dunxin Road, the order of ranking remained the same as before.</p>
<p>Finish</p>
<p>Turning from Daxilu into Yidingpan Road, the finish line was just 0.5 miles away. On Haig Road, the rankings remained the same.

In front of Guangxia Middle School on Moore Road, Wang bravely surged forward. Liu Guangfa, Huang Jinfu, Lin Guoyou, Li Duan, Ma Riji, and Geli Mengsi were within three to four meters of each other. Turning onto Jing'an Temple Road, the finish line was in sight. Wang Zhenglin accelerated, dashing straight to Baker Road, and turning into Chengdu Road. At this time, over four thousand spectators stood on the roadside, applauding and cheering. Upon entering the athletic field of the Private Shanghai Middle School, he reached the finish line first with a time of 1 hour, 6 minutes, 34 seconds, winning the championship. Liu Guangfa, lagging behind by thirty meters, won second place. Huang Jinfu, another seventy meters behind Liu, came in third. Awards were presented after the race.

<h3>Unable to Resume Work Due to Poor Environment: The Appeal of the Lunchang Workers: Sincere Words of Suffering Hunger to Preserve Reputation and Unwillingness to be Exploited: Hope for Relief from All Sectors</h3>
<p>The Lunchang Textile Factory's decision to resume work was interfered with unexpectedly, resulting in an unfortunate incident in which the British employee, Ding Geqin, was killed. This matter has aroused concern from all parties. After investigation, the details of the incident at the factory are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Process of Resuming Work at Lunchang After the War</p>
<p>The Lunchang Textile Factory's old factory in Bailianjing has been in operation for sixteen or seventeen years. During the August 13th Incident, the factory was unable to continue working due to the war, and it was temporarily declared closed. The workers were also dismissed and returned to their hometowns. In the 26th year of the Republic of China, when the war shifted westward, the factory announced in September that it was preparing to resume work. Because the workers were scattered, it was not until February or March of the 27th year that workers gradually came to the factory to resume work. Due to the impact of the war, the factory reduced the original bonus of 15 yuan per thousand pieces, regardless of whether they were multicolored or not, and gradually sought to restore it.</p>
<p>Labor-Capital Coordination Resolves Disputes</p>
<p>Recently, prices of all goods have been expensive, and workers' lives have become more difficult. The workers of the factory loved the factory and were very enthusiastic. The factory also cared about the workers. The workers requested the factory to increase the bonus to subsidize rice. The labor and capital sides, based on the spirit of mutual assistance, negotiated for three weeks. The factory agreed to increase the rice subsidy by three tenths and the bonus by five percent. The workers believed that the factory's response was satisfactory and decided to continue working immediately.</p>
<p>Unexpected Obstruction Prevents Resumption of Work</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after the plan had been agreed upon, when the workers went to the factory to resume work, members of the South Wharf puppet self-defense corps, instigated by others, came out to interfere and prevented the workers from going to work. As a result, the factory was surrounded by puppet troops, and the workers could not go to work. At that time, two workers were injured by the puppet corps members. Until now, the workers preparing to work at the factory are still being prevented, and they have been exposed to the elements and have experienced hardship. However, the workers of the factory are determined and will not be exploited by others. They have also sent letters to all sectors, appealing for relief.</p>
<p>Workers' Letter Describes Suffering</p>
<p>To the Editor of Shenbao: We are writing because the previous report in your newspaper about the resumption of work at the old Lunchang factory failed to clarify all the circumstances of the strike. Therefore, we workers are now reporting all the circumstances to all sectors of society to clarify the truth. Our factory has been in operation for sixteen or seventeen years. In terms of printing alone, we cannot describe all the details. Originally, the bonus was calculated at 15 yuan per thousand pieces, regardless of whether they were multicolored or not. Until August 13th, our country was invaded,</p>
<p>The War Broke Out</p>
<p>The factory was unable to start work, work was stopped, and the workers were dispersed to their hometowns to avoid the disaster, suffering unspeakable hardships. It was not until the 26th year of the Republic of China that the war in Shanghai shifted westward, and the Pudong area was slightly calmer. In September of that year, the factory, seeing this, immediately published a notice to recruit workers from all departments in preparation for starting work. At that time, because the workers were scattered in various hometowns to escape the disaster, the factory could not start work in full. It was not until February or March of the 27th year that workers living nearby came to the factory to resume work. At this time, the factory</p>
<p>Reduced the Bonus</p>
<p>Calculated by multicolored or less colored, the multicolored was reduced to 10 yuan and 5 cents per thousand pieces, and the less colored was reduced to 5 yuan and 25 cents. According to this calculation, it has been reduced by more than half. During the War of Resistance, people from all over came to Shanghai to make a living. There was no way to maintain life, so they had to bear it painfully. However, because they could not maintain life, they had to ask the factory to increase the bonus to subsidize rice. After three weeks of negotiations, the factory finally agreed to</p>
<p>Increase Rice Subsidy</p>
<p>by three tenths, and the bonus was increased by five percent. The workers thought that the reply was satisfactory and allowed to resume work. Unexpectedly, on the day of resumption of work, members of the South Wharf puppet self-defense corps, instigated by a certain party, came out to interfere and prevented the workers from going to work. There were also Japanese soldiers protecting the scene, but it was still ineffective. As a result, every morning at five or six o'clock, the factory was surrounded by puppet troops, oppressing the workers and preventing them from going to work. Two workers were injured, and there were various kinds of intrusions into the factory. The workers were</p>
<p>Unarmed</p>
<p>The factory also had no way to guarantee their safety, so the workers had to leave the factory, enduring the pain of darkness and starvation. We earnestly request charitable people from all walks of life to have great compassion and find ways to relieve the lives of hundreds of workers, which is better than building a seven-story pagoda. The workers will be reborn and will do their best. The workers would rather endure the suffering of hunger than accept the money from selling themselves and shouting, in order to preserve the reputation of our Chinese nation. The above points are all facts. Sincerely requested by all the workers of the old Lunchang factory in Bailianjing,</p>
<h3>Japanese Embassy Counselor Morishima Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Morishima, the counselor of the Japanese Embassy, left Shanghai to return to Japan a week ago to report to his government. It is learned that Morishima, having completed his mission, returned to Shanghai from Japan yesterday in a hurry.</p>
<h3>Ferry Services Suspended in South Pudong</h3>
<p>The situation in South Pudong has been quite unsettling for several days. It is rumored that Japanese troops are searching at various ferry crossings. The ferries at Bailianjing and Liuliqiao have been suspended since yesterday.</p>
<h3>Britain Protests to Japan: Contents of the Note: The Requested Contents are Divided into Six Items, Requesting the Japanese Authorities to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reports that yesterday (the 10th), it was learned that the British Consul-General, Mr. Phelips, formally sent a note to the Japanese Consul-General, Mr. Miura, on Friday, confirming the oral negotiations made by Mr. Phelips on Wednesday. The note stated that there were several teams of armed plainclothes Japanese near the Lunchang Printing Factory in Bailianjing, Pudong, who were intimidating Chinese workers who hoped to resume work after the strike was resolved, and who shot at two British employees of Lunchang who were leaving the factory to encourage workers to return to the factory, forcing the printing factory to temporarily close. The</p>
<p>Written Protest</p>
<p>Requests: A. To restrain armed agitators from operating near the printing factory. B. Japanese soldiers should fully protect the British employees still residing in the printing factory and the Lujiazui Textile Factory. C. To restrain agitators near the Lujiazui Textile Factory. D. To restrain the current widespread anti-British agitation and propaganda. E. To prevent anti-British parades in Pudong and the posting of large anti-British banners, as well as the distribution of</p>
<p>Similar Nature</p>
<p>Printed materials. F. To restrain the "Great People's Assembly" and other anti-British groups. What is of particular interest is that the note for the first time cited the anti-British agitation in the Xin Shenbao, which is under Japanese control, and formally asked the Japanese authorities to pay attention. The note mentioned an article published in the Xin Shenbao last Wednesday and accused the article of actually inciting damage to British interests. The British Consulate-General considered it</p>
<p>Particularly Unfortunate</p>
<p>that the article was published the day after the Ding Geqin tragedy. The British authorities have made efforts to restrain the anti-Japanese propaganda in the Chinese newspapers of British merchants in this area, and asked Mr. Sanpu to take similar actions with regard to Xin Shenbao. According to the article published in the Xin Shenbao, it said that the British came to China with the ambition of robbers and that they aimed to extract wages to</p>
<p>And it also said that the strike at the Lunchang Textile Factory could not be resolved, and compromise meant complete destruction. It called on the workers to follow the spirit of the Guangzhou workers who overthrew British imperialism in China on January 27th.</p>
<h3>Affected by Foreign Exchange Contraction: Various Industries Raise Prices: The Impact on Social Life is Far from Superficial</h3>
<p>Since the drastic changes in foreign exchange rates, the prices of foreign goods imported into China have been increasing. Due to cost reasons, many industries have raised prices. Yesterday, the taxi industry, the leather industry, and the screw industry all announced price increases. The details are listed below:</p>
<p>Taxi Companies Increase Fares</p>
<p>The Shanghai Taxi Industry Association announced an increase in fares, stating: "Due to the sudden contraction of foreign exchange, the prices of gasoline and tire parts have soared. It is difficult for our members to support this. Therefore, from 00:00 on June 12 (i.e., after 12:00 on the night of the 11th), taxi fares will be increased. The minimum charge will be one yuan and forty cents in national currency every twenty minutes, and four yuan and twenty cents per hour, in order to supplement costs. However, the increased amount is still insufficient to maintain costs. Therefore, this notice is hereby published to inform all sectors of society, and we hope for your understanding."</p>
<p>Leather Industry Announces Price Increase</p>
<p>The Leather Industry Association announced: "Due to the drastic changes in foreign exchange rates, raw material prices have soared, and the source of raw hides is scarce. If we do not urgently increase prices, it will be difficult to maintain costs. It has now been jointly discussed by the industry that, starting from today, heavy-duty bottom leather will be priced at 1.85 yuan per kilogram in legal currency, and medium and light-duty bottom leather will be priced at 1.80 yuan per kilogram in legal currency. In order to inform all, this notice is hereby issued, and we hope for your understanding."</p>
<p>Screw Prices Increased by 25%</p>
<p>The Republic of China Screw Company announced: "Recently, due to the sudden tightening of exchange rates, raw materials have become extremely expensive. The wholesale prices of the Tapa Brand screws produced by our factory will be increased by 25% (i.e., 25 percent) from today, according to the price list. This is unavoidable, and we hope for your understanding." In addition, the hardware industry and the hardware parts industry have also decided to increase prices, with hardware increasing by 30% and parts increasing by 20%. In addition, foreign paper, kerosene, pigments, wool, piece goods, tobacco, coal, sugar, and other industries have also increased prices one after another, but not uniformly.</p>
<p>Wireless Materials Also Increased</p>
<p>The vacuum tubes and various parts for installing radios sold in the city's wireless materials stores, except for a few that are manufactured by the factory itself, are mostly shipped from the United States and the Netherlands. Recently, due to the sudden changes in foreign exchange rates, costs have increased. The industry has had to increase the selling price. Therefore, the selling prices of these vacuum tubes and parts have been increased by two to three cents each, in order to maintain costs.</p>
<h3>Wife of French Ambassador Arrives in Shanghai from Paris, with Two Daughters</h3>
<p>After the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Gosmart, left Shanghai for Chongqing, his wife and two children arrived in Shanghai on the 10th on the postal ship Ashah from Paris, France. After arriving in Shanghai, the Ambassador's wife immediately changed to a car and returned to the Ambassador's residence to rest. The Ambassador's eldest daughter, Alice, is eighteen years old this year, and the younger daughter, Saiyas, is only six years old this year.</p>
<h3>Japanese Arrest Chinese Again South of Suzhou Creek, Only Notifying the Police Department Upon Release: Detained for Interrogation in a Heroin Case</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reports that two plainclothes Japanese, without notifying the Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department, again arrested a Chinese person outside Nanjing Road on the south bank of Suzhou Creek yesterday morning (the 10th). It was only when they decided to release the arrested Chinese person that they notified the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities. The arrested person was a Chinese broker, Chen Fengshan (transliteration). As soon as he got out of his car, two plainclothes Japanese men arrived and dragged him into their car, driving across the Waibaidu Bridge and into Hongkou. Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese took the broker to the Central Police Station and handed him over to the Shanghai Municipal Council authorities. The Japanese told the police that they had arrested him because they wanted to question Chen about the sale of heroin. The Japanese suspected him of engaging in heroin trading, but the suspicion had been proven unfounded, so they decided to hand him over to the Shanghai Municipal Council police. Chen was then released by the Police Department.</p>

<h3>After the Foreign Exchange Market Price Adjustment: Hope for a Sharp Increase in Domestic Goods Exports: Southwest Customs' Successful Management Turns into Export Surplus: Shanghai and Tianjin Customs' Import Surplus May be Reduced Thereafter</h3>
<p>After the Chinese government adjusted foreign exchange market prices, the foreign exchange in the Shanghai market was tightened, but this was beneficial to China's international balance of payments, reducing the import of useless foreign goods, eliminating import surpluses, and encouraging exports. However, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee decided to do everything possible to maintain the stability of foreign exchange rates. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>After Southwest Customs' Export Surplus and the Shanghai Customs' Efforts to Eliminate Import Surplus, the men's customs of Mengzi, Simao, Tengyue, Longzhou, Beihai, Qiongzhou, Leizhou, Jiangmen, as well as Wenzhou and Shantou in the Southwest have now become export-surplus customs. However, the customs in the occupied areas are still in import surplus, and the numbers are increasing. The largest are Shanghai, Tianjin, Jiaozhou, Yantai, Qinhuangdao, and Xiamen. For example, from January to April this year, Tianjin's import surplus was 74.3007 million yuan, Shanghai's import surplus was 72.316 million yuan, Jiaozhou's import surplus was 14.9511 million yuan, and Yantai's import surplus was 5.09 million yuan.</p>
<p>The April Import Surplus Set a New Record. Regarding the country's foreign trade, at the beginning of the war, from September to December 1937, the monthly import surpluses were changed to export surpluses. The total export surplus for those four months was 53.627 million yuan. From June to September 1938, each month was also an export surplus, with a total export surplus of 20.638 million yuan for those four months. However, from October last year to April this year, there have been import surpluses, totaling 156.242 million yuan. The highest new record for the import surplus since the war was created in April of this year, amounting to 56.541 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Value of Imported Foreign Goods is Alarming. Taking the imports of foreign goods from January to April this year as an example, the first was miscellaneous grains and flours, valued at 59.196 million yuan. The second was candles, soaps, oils, fats, waxes, glues, and rosin, valued at 42.146 million yuan. The third was cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton thread, valued at 40.39 million yuan. The fourth was miscellaneous goods, valued at 22.413 million yuan. The fifth was gold ore and metal sand, valued at 20.658 million yuan. Compared with the same period last year, except for a decrease in miscellaneous goods, metals, and ores, the item of cotton, cotton yarn, and cotton thread increased by 37.427 million yuan.</p>
<p>Adjusting Foreign Exchange to Encourage Exports. Since the Chinese government adjusted foreign exchange market prices and the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation restricted the supply of foreign exchange in the black market, the foreign exchange in Shanghai's black market has tightened, which will reduce the import of useless foreign goods, and the import surpluses of Shanghai and Tianjin Customs will naturally be eliminated. The export of China's main domestic goods can be increased. The government, in addition to striving to increase the production of tung oil, medicinal materials, mineral sands, silk, and cotton, has also designated the Trade Commission to be responsible for control and centralized export to Hong Kong and other places. The export of domestic goods that are settled in foreign exchange is exempt from export taxes and transit taxes, and the Central Trust Bureau provides insurance for various risks.</p>
<p>The Stabilization Committee is Responsible for Maintaining Foreign Exchange. The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee will continue to do everything possible to maintain the foreign exchange in Shanghai's black market, ensuring that prices reach a horizontal line. At the same time, the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation is working closely with the committee to jointly stabilize the exchange rate in Shanghai's black market. Foreign exchange will still be supplied as much as possible to importers who have legitimate needs. Other banks, such as Maisley, Citibank, etc., are also taking the same action. Therefore, the exchange rate in Shanghai's black market has stabilized and will not shrink again, and the legal foreign exchange price of the Central Bank remains the same and unchanged.</p>
<h3>Little Foreign Exchange Trading; Slight Activity Expected This Morning; Gasoline Prices Slightly Increased; Foreign Newspapers and Magazines Also Increase Prices</h3>
<p>Mainland newspapers report that the Shanghai exchange market was not very active yesterday (the 10th) morning, but the closing at noon was quite stable. At that time, HSBC, according to the British exchange rate of six pence five three one two five, began to sell foreign exchange to local banks. This exchange rate is higher than the six pence five three one two five maintained by various managing banks until a few minutes before closing on Saturday and Sunday. This is the effort of our Sino-British Equalization Fund to</p>
<p>stabilize the market. Last night, local bankers and brokers were also unclear about this point, and could not obtain news from the managing banks in Shanghai. Therefore, the public and the local financial community will have to wait until Monday to see the changes after that. There was little foreign exchange trading yesterday morning. Some activity is certainly inevitable. The managing banks sold foreign exchange at six pence five until near the noon closing. Various banks continued to</p>
<p>sell small amounts of British pounds and US dollars to customers. Although there were unfulfilled orders from the Japanese side, there were no large transactions in the brokerage community. Yesterday, many importers and merchants increased the prices of goods, causing the cost of living in Shanghai to continue to rise. Personnel from major oil companies in the city stated on Friday that they currently do not intend to raise prices, but gasoline has already increased from one yuan four jiao per gallon to one yuan five jiao. Since the exchange rate began to plummet, the value of imported</p>
<p>magazines and newspapers has increased by 35% to 50%. Also, according to Yilu yesterday, according to the existing land regulations, the Public Works Department has the right to take actions it deems appropriate in an emergency to "maintain peace and order," so the bureau has the right to control food prices. Last night, it was heard from reliable sources that the current price surge is not considered an emergency by the Public Works Department.</p>
<h3>Xinghua and Quanzhou Shipping Suspended; Quietly Awaiting British Government Negotiations; Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Lundon and Keeler Companies Have All Temporarily Suspended Sending Ships to Xingquan Ports</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese naval authorities obstructed third-country ships from sailing to the nine ports of Neigang Haimen Qidong Quanzhou Xinghua, etc., except for the Haimen Qidong on the Beisha Line, where the ships changed the place names to clear customs and barely sailed, the Xinghua Quanzhou route was forced to suspend shipping. British companies Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, Yilung, and Keeler have all temporarily suspended sending ships to sail. They are now quietly awaiting negotiations between the British government and Japan.</p>
<h3>Thrift Movement Committee Earnestly Urges Citizens Not to Enter Gambling Dens, Providing Limited Money for Unreasonable Extortion is No Different from Moths Flying into a Fire and Throwing Themselves into a Net</h3>
<p>The Thrift Movement Committee of this city, previously because the gambling dens in West Shanghai harmed society, had issued a notice to all citizens, not to be bewitched by them. Now, considering that the gambling trend is more rampant than before, and the harm is unknown, yesterday it issued another letter to the citizens, giving earnest advice, with earnest words and a long heart, and it is urgently recorded as follows: Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the road sections beyond the boundary in West Shanghai, under the protection of the Japanese puppets, have been full of gambling dens, and the gambling trend is rampant. Shaking stalls and roulette are everywhere. It is beautifully named "Some Club", but in fact it is</p>
<p>a place to hide dirt, accommodate filth, commit adultery and commit crimes. Everything from prostitutes to drugs is available. The people in charge are mostly local ruffians, who use the protection of dark forces to implement their poisonous methods of sucking cream, sucking blood, and killing people without using knives. The harm to society is actually greater than floods and beasts. Recently, it has become even more intensified, and has conceived ingenious ideas, actually borrowing names, publishing advertisements, and luring citizens into it. However, some people who do not know how to love themselves have obliterated their conscience, been blinded by interests, and do not hesitate to fly moths into the fire,</p>
<p>throwing themselves into the net, calling Lu and drinking pheasant, enjoying it tirelessly, providing limited money for unlimited extortion, and even embezzling public funds, making all kinds of arrangements, indulging in momentary excitement, making a desperate bet, and eventually ruining their reputation and reaching the end of the road, or regretting it too late, and developing shortsightedness. All these facts have been published in newspapers, and they are often seen. Thinking of this, how can we not sigh? Looking back at those invaders, they are very strict with the overseas Chinese in Shanghai. Even those who gamble with slot machines must be severely punished. The Chinese people feel guilty about this, and can they not be aware and deeply repent? In particular, during extraordinary times, we are working hard on thrift, how can we recklessly engage in extravagant gambling, causing</p>
<p>the already thin to become fat and only satisfy the enemy? This association thinks it is dangerous and inconvenient to remain silent, so it dares to reveal its sincerity again and earnestly urge all citizens of the city, if they are trapped in gambling dens, they should extricate themselves from it as soon as possible, and not continue to be obsessed and go deep into the wrong path. Those who have not entered gambling dens should maintain purity, never go there, and hope that fathers will advise their sons, brothers will warn their younger brothers, teachers will monitor their students, and shop owners will be strict with their partners, and friends should also supervise each other and encourage each other, so that the treacherous people will have nowhere to use their tricks, which will not only be the blessing of society, but also the benefit of the country.</p>
<h3>Amidst Foreign Exchange Tightening, Rice Prices Rise Again; No. 1 White Rice Breaks 18 Yuan Mark; Fortunately, There is Sufficient Stockpile, and There is No Worry About People's Food</h3>
<p>Since various rice industry groups have tried their best to dredge the sources and the concession authorities have cracked down on speculation and manipulation, the market rice price has begun to fall back and stabilize. Now, due to the tightening of the black market foreign exchange and the increase in the cost of foreign rice, at the same time, there are rumors of prohibition of export in various places such as Kunshan, coupled with the rare arrival of goods in recent days, the market rice price has risen again. No. 1 white rice has broken the 18 yuan mark, and the price of other types of rice has exceeded 17 yuan. Speculators in the market deliberately release them, attempting to manipulate them. Rice prices have become serious. Fortunately, the existing stockpile is sufficient. Although prices have risen, there is no worry about people's food.</p>

<h3>People's Self-Defense Army Attacks Hongqiao Airport; Tax Collection Agency Also Attacked; Traffic Once Cut Off</h3>
<p>Since the Jiangzhe People's Self-Defense Army arrived and scattered in Qibao Sijing area of West Shanghai last month, they immediately destroyed the highway bridges to block the traffic of the Japanese puppet army and launched attacks from time to time. Therefore, the Japanese puppet army in that area was extremely panicked. According to people from that area, on the evening of the 7th of this month, Commander Wang of the First Detachment of the Self-Defense Army personally led Xue's Second Battalion to attack the Japanese puppet army stationed at Hongqiao Airport and the puppet tax collection agency. The Japanese puppet army fought in a hurry and was in a state of panic. After half an hour, they collapsed and fled to West Shanghai. It is said that more than 20 Japanese puppet soldiers were killed or injured in this battle, and the Self-Defense Army suffered 8 or 9 casualties. More than a dozen long and short guns were seized, as well as a lot of canned food. The army returned to its original defense, and traffic to Shanghai was once cut off at that time.</p>

<h3>Notice from the Chinese Consul-General in the Philippines; Measures for Refugees to Enter the Philippines; Ships Sailing from Shanghai and Hong Kong to the Philippines Can Carry Refugees; Holders of "Manchukuo" Passports, Etc. Are Refused Landing</h3>
<p>The Philippine government has reached an agreement with the Chinese Consul-General in the Philippines regarding the measures for Chinese war zone refugees to enter the Philippines, stipulating that ships sailing from Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shantou, Xiamen, and Fujian can carry 100 refugees per ship. However, those holding passports from "Manchukuo" and the "Shanghai Special Municipal Government" requesting to enter the Philippines have been refused landing by the Philippine government. The following is a record of the notice from the Chinese Consul-General in the Philippines regarding the measures for refugees to go to the Philippines:</p>
<p>In the case of refugees from our country coming to the Philippines, this consulate has already handled it properly. The following are the procedures that all refugees should go through: (1) For each batch of 100 refugees, this consulate will first fill out a letter of guarantee on their behalf and send it to the review committee for review, and publish the names, genders, and numbers of the 100 refugees in the newspapers. (2) After the refugees have been announced, their applicants should immediately go to the review committee with two guarantors to sign in person and pay a guarantee fee of five pesos per person (the review committee's office hours are from 5:00 pm to 6:00 pm, and it is closed on holidays). (3) After the review committee deems the refugee's guarantor qualified, it will send the letter of guarantee to this consulate. The applicant for each refugee will take the receipt for the stamp fee of six yuan and six jiao previously paid to this consulate and collect the refugee certificate from the consulate. (4) The applicant who obtains the refugee certificate can directly send the refugee certificate to the refugee, so that they can use it to purchase a ticket to the Philippines from the shipping company. (5) The representative of each refugee must report to the consulate two days before the refugee arrives in the Philippines. This consulate will send personnel to board the ship with personnel from the Philippine Immigration Office when the ship docks to verify the refugee's photos and issue another receipt (the receipt states that they should go to the consulate on a certain day to complete the procedures). At the same time, the refugee certificate will be collected, and then they will be released to disembark. (6) After the refugees disembark, they will go to the consulate on the date stated on the receipt issued by this consulate on the ship to complete the procedures, and then the refugee certificate will be returned to them, which will be held by each refugee as proof of staying in the Philippines. (7) The qualifications of the guarantor must have considerable property, shops, or cash. (8) Old refugees who stayed in the Philippines before, if they want to use credit guarantee, they must submit the receipt for six yuan and six jiao issued by this consulate for verification. (9) This consulate and the review committee will only continue to handle the next batch of procedures after one batch has been completed. The above detailed measures are hereby notified to all overseas Chinese for compliance. This announcement.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Bombed</h3>
<p>The shipping industry received a telegram yesterday stating that at around 9:00 am on the 10th, six Japanese aircraft invaded Mawei, Fuzhou, and bombed it. The losses were not reported in detail, but Fuzhou has suffered heavy losses since it was repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft. Commerce is depressed. Japanese warships anchored in Quanzhou Bay sometimes launch speedboats to patrol the coast, seemingly with some intentions. The local garrison is on high alert.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Daishan Have Not Yet Withdrawn</h3>
<p>Since Japanese troops landed on Daishan in Dinghai, they have not yet withdrawn. Recently, they have also forcibly collected fishing taxes and salt taxes, causing considerable unease among local residents. It has been found that the footprints of Japanese troops have spread to Gaoting in the south of the island and Dongsha Cape in the north. As for Changtu Island, the Japanese troops have withdrawn. It has been found that Changtu and Daishan are only separated by a body of water. The Japanese troops are stationed on Daishan and have not withdrawn, and Weitu feels uneasy.</p>
<h3>Litigation Procedures During Extraordinary Times; The Court Orders Efforts to Be Simple and Quick; Delay in Handling May Cause Accidents; A Special Order Is Issued to All Levels of Courts to Pay Attention</h3>
<p>For the convenience of the people during extraordinary times, the Judicial Yuan of the National Government specially ordered all levels of courts to simplify the litigation procedures. The original order stated that civil and criminal litigation procedures are cumbersome. During these extraordinary times, if the handling is delayed, not only will the criminal defendants in custody be at risk of accidents, but also the pain felt by both parties in civil cases will be more profound than usual. All levels of courts and prosecutors should understand this meaning and, within the scope permitted by laws and regulations, strive for quick litigation procedures, simple judgments and other documents, so as to save time and facilitate the people. They should be informed accordingly.</p>
<h3>Chartering a Ship to Join a Japanese Merchant Organization; Shipowner Sues for the Return of the Ship; Owner of Fish Market Relies on Chartering the Ship; The Court Orders Both Parties to Attempt Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Han Funan, a local resident residing at No. 44, Tongli, Mintini Yin Road, French Concession (49 years old), purchased a steamer before August 13, specializing in sailing to various inland rivers. After the withdrawal of the National Army, he left Shanghai and anchored in Tianshenggang. Until February of last year, Qu Songqing (44 years old), a local resident who opened the Quchangshun Fish Market on Xiaodongmen Street, and his uncle Qu Jiugao, brought out Cai Juming, the old captain of the ship, to charter the ship from Han for</p>
<p>transporting fresh fish</p>
<p>At that time, in addition to signing a contract, the various documents that the ship should have were handed over to Qu Songqing for counting, and Qu issued a receipt. Later, because Qu's uncle did not intend to continue after the three-month lease period expired, the contract was destroyed. However, Qu Songqing personally still wanted to continue the lease, so instead of using the name of Quchangshun Fish Market, Qu brought out Liu Wuzhai, a native of Wuxi, to continue the lease, and he himself was in the position of guarantor. Therefore,</p>
<p>another contract was signed</p>
<p>extending it for two months, so the chartering and all its accessories were not returned by Qu and then delivered again, saving procedures. Unexpectedly, after the expiration date of July 17, 1938, Qu actually estimated the value of the ship and made it a share, joining the "Hainei River Steamboat Company" run by the Japanese, and the ship's name was changed to "Yixing Maru." The shipowner Han Funan learned about this, and immediately entrusted a lawyer to send a letter to question and urge the return of the ship, but Qu ignored it. Therefore, Han could not bear it and hired lawyer Wu Peng to file a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Liu Wuzhai, Qu Songqing, Yan Shanzhou, etc., for</p>
<p>the return of the chartered ship</p>
<p>and compensation for the ship price totaling 19,200 yuan. At the same time, he applied for provisional execution. The initial trial resulted in the rejection of the plaintiff's claim. After Han received the judgment, he was unwilling to accept it and still hired lawyer Wu to appeal to the Third Branch of the Higher Court. The case was heard by Judge Tong the other day, and both parties were represented by lawyers. The appellate agent stated the reasons for not accepting the original judgment and the appeal in four points: (1) The Ying Shi lawyer hired by the opposing party in the first instance was the former president of the local court, and the judge in charge of the case was his former subordinate, which inevitably</p>
<p>lacked fairness</p>
<p>(2) The appellant transferred the ship to a company run by a Japanese merchant and falsely accused the appellant of being voluntary. If the appellant had entrusted this lawyer to send a letter of inquiry on July 23, 1938, why did he not reply and instead asked his friend Wang Zhiliang to come to discuss mediation? (3) It is said that the ship has been recovered. Why are the contract and insurance policy still in the hands of the appellant? Even if the appellant failed to retrieve and return them at that time, a receipt should be issued to clear the procedures. (4) The current letter from Pan Sansheng, the Chinese manager of the Japanese merchant "Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Company," to Qu Songqing mentions that the ship has been made a share and the</p>
<p>contract period</p>
<p>actually states "Showa, March 15, 1938," which shows that Qu Songqing had long been harboring evil intentions, colluding with Pan, relying on power, and trying to swallow the chartered ship. Later, the opposing lawyer Tang Ying responded to each point and requested that Pan Sansheng, the person in charge of the Japanese merchant "Inland River Steamboat Company," be summoned to court to testify at the next hearing. At this point, the appellate agent immediately stood up to express his opposition, saying that Qu and Pan were in the same voice, so the court ignored it. Then, the witness Cai Juming (the old captain of the ship) was questioned. He testified that when the ship was anchored in Tianshenggang, it was within the</p>
<p>Japanese blockade line</p>
<p>At that time, Qu Xiaokai came to contact me and said that he was familiar with the Japanese and could be responsible for dragging it out, but it had to be chartered to his fish market for use, so I introduced it to the shipowner and signed a charter contract, and I continued to be the captain of the ship. Later, the ship was dragged away by the Japanese merchant, which was agreed to by Qu Xiaokai. After that, my salary was also instructed by Qu to be collected from the company. Qu himself also went to the company every day, but although I am a villager, I am unwilling to continue serving and have now resigned. What I said above is all the truth. We who eat on the boat cannot tell lies. Then, the witness Wang Zhiliang was questioned and testified that both parties are friends. Since the ship was</p>
<p>dragged away by the Japanese</p>
<p>I have been serving as a mediator. Mr. Qu Songqing is a big businessman. This matter was completely wrong, but he knew the desire for profit and recklessly joined the Japanese merchant. If he had returned it at that time, there would not have been litigation. Recently, I heard that the Japanese merchant, "Inland River Steamboat Company," is making a lot of money. According to my observation, this case is easy to reconcile. In the future, I am still willing to mediate, etc. The court reviewed the words and instructed both parties to go out and attempt reconciliation, and adjourned the hearing to another date.</p>
<h3>Tenth Public Bus Runs Over an Old Man</h3>
<p>Near the Wuzhen Road Bridge on Xinzha Road, a certain number ten public bus, traveling east to west, sped past at around 10 pm last night. Coincidentally, an old man over the age of 50, wearing white old cloth trousers, was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked to the ground, injuring his head and vital parts, and was on the verge of death. When the patrolling police heard the alarm, they rushed to the scene, copied the driver's license number, and urgently transported the injured man to Baolong Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and he died soon after.</p>
<h3>Robbery of a Silk Weaving Factory</h3>
<p>The Hengfeng Silk Weaving Factory near the Yanjiachiao of Jixifei Road in West Shanghai has only eight looms, and is a small-scale silk weaving factory, employing a total of only 30 male and female workers. It was jointly opened by Cao of Hangzhou and others. The accountant is Bian Shaoqing of Jiaxing. At around 11 pm the night before (the 10th), more than a dozen bandits suddenly came. Three of the bandits broke into the accounting room with pistols. At that time, the accountant Bian Shaoqing had not yet fallen asleep and was held by the bandits, forcing him to hand over the key to the account box. They only searched for 23 yuan in cash and more than 5 yuan in corner tickets and auxiliary coins. The bandits were still not satisfied, and robbed 12 pieces of Huasi Ge, which had not yet been sorted on the shelf, worth more than 300 yuan, and fled. One</p>
<h3>Kidnapping of a Good Family's Daughter; Criminals Chen Bingwen and Sun Shiqi Arrested; Parents Meet in Court and Cry in Each Other's Arms</h3>
<p>The French Police Department of Lujiawan received a secret report the day before yesterday (the 10th) stating that there were criminals selling women in Room 33, Wuling Apartment, Guifu Lane, Bair Road. The West Detective Li immediately led Chinese Detective Wang Guancheng to Room 33 of the apartment and arrested Chen Bingwen (26 years old, residing at No. 8, Yejiazhai, Yanping Road), a native of Changshu, and Sun Shiqi (24 years old, residing at Kangnaot Road), a native of Haimen, and</p>
<p>the young woman Wen Xiu</p>
<p>He was also brought back to the police station. According to Chen's confession, Wei Wenxiu is the legal wife of the people, and she is 21 years old this year. Because of poverty, she had no choice but to sell his wife to others. The price was negotiated at 600 yuan, and there was no illegal behavior. However, when questioned, Wei Wenxiu was vague and seemed to want to say something but stopped, with infinite pain and laughter that were not laughter. The detectives in charge believed that Chen Bingwen was a rough man with a black face, while Wei was a beautiful woman,</p>
<p>a small jasper</p>
<p>With such a woman, it was definitely not Chen's spouse. It was thought that there must be something mysterious about them. Chen and Wei were interrogated separately, and only then did they know that Chen was a big bandit who kidnapped good women and sold them. It was also found that Wei was 17 years old this year, and her father Wei Fuxing was 44 years old this year. He worked as a carpenter in the Tanler Motor Company and lived at No. 34, Yejiazhai, Yanping Road. It was originally a happy little family.</p>
<p>Criminal Chen lives nearby</p>
<p>Specializes in forming gangs to rob in the area beyond the border roads of Yanping Road and Kangnao Road, committing numerous crimes. Seeing that Wei Wenxiu was beautiful, he had bad intentions. On the evening of the 5th of this month at 7 pm, he gathered a few of his party members and threatened to make a scene at Wei's house with a pistol, and then took Wei away and hid her in Wuling Apartment, intending to sell her at a price. The opportunity was not secret, and it was discovered by someone</p>
<p>reported to the police station</p>
<p>Arrested, Sun Shiqi is Chen's accomplice. Later, the detective summoned the woman's father to the case. The father and daughter met and cried in each other's arms. Since the location of the incident was in the public police station, the captain ordered the two criminals Chen and Sun and the woman to be transferred to the Public Concession Police Station for verification.</p>
<h3>Wanting a Divorce; Falsely Accusing the Man of Theft; Sentencing Today</h3>
<p>Gu Zhengong, a native of Huzhou, residing at No. 21, Songjiaben, Beijing Road, and running a throat clinic at the Tianshengtang National Medicine Store, No. 64, Xiafei Road, French Concession, is 23 years old this year. He healed the disease of Yin Rongqiu, a Muslim woman from Hubei residing at No. 3471, Yinghua Lane, Robert Road, West Shanghai. Through the introduction of Zhang Shuqiao and Jia Xuewen, they officially married on March 3 of last year, with the condition that Yin's parents would be supported by Gu, and Gu would also join Islam. It is known that not long after the engagement, the feelings of both parties changed,</p>
<p>and disagreements arose</p>
<p>and gradually became worse. Later, Yin Rongqiu sued Gu Zhenghong in the First Special Court for theft of rings, injury, and obstruction of freedom, but the results were all unsuccessful. The woman then filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Gu, requesting the dissolution of the marriage. The reasons given were that Gu's character had changed greatly and his actions were obscene. The case was repeatedly opened for trial by Judge Wu Xiaoke, but it was not concluded. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The case was opened for continued trial the other day. The plaintiff stated the reasons as before. The defendant Gu Zhenghong said, "Our legal marriage must have legal reasons before it can be dissolved. Now the plaintiff is completely falsely accusing me of bad behavior and absurd behavior,</p>
<p>completely false</p>
<p>There is no corresponding evidence to present. It is difficult to agree to the request for dissolution without reason. If the plaintiff has someone else in mind to marry, thinking that it will hinder her marriage, I can forgive the dissolution for the sake of her lifelong happiness and happy family. However, I have spent a lot of money for her. Now the plaintiff is completely instigated by her uncle Yin Zongquan to request dissolution. Please reject it so that we can get married early." Lawyer Wang Xintang also debated for him. The court reviewed the situation and announced the end of the debate, and scheduled the sentence for the 12th (today). However, it is expected that one of the parties in the initial trial judgment will find it difficult to accept and will inevitably appeal. It is not known when the litigation will end.</p>
<h3>Fake Trademarks - Over Seven Hundred Counterfeit Hats Seized - Approval Granted to Confiscate and Further Investigate</h3>
<p>The Huacheng Hat Factory at 669 Zhejiang Road, although producing its own goods, often engaged in trademark infringement, thereby gaining substantial profits and filling the pockets of its partners. Now, with the arrival of summer and the popularity of straw hats, they secretly manufactured fake imitations of two types of trademarked felt and straw hats from a famous British factory day and night, mixing them into the market. Unsuspecting buyers were often deceived. The agent of the original trademark hat company investigated and confirmed the counterfeiting, reporting it to the General Inspectorate, who then requested a search warrant from the First Special District Court. On Friday, Chinese Detective Zhu Shouling, along with Western Deputy Detective Breit, were dispatched to the factory address. They seized over seven hundred counterfeit hats. Their styles and English trademark names were entirely identical to the genuine ones, except that the inner brim of the "鼎" brand hats had the added Chinese characters "British Made." The factory owner and others are still under investigation. This morning, the Inspectorate's lawyer Qian Xunjiu went to court to report the search results, requesting the confiscation of the fake goods. Judge Dai Rongduo approved the request, ordering all the items to be confiscated for further investigation.</p>
<p>Major Fire in the Nanshi District</p>
<p>Around 10:15 PM on the night before last (the 10th), a woodpile at the Yang Hongji Construction Factory, located behind the Dongshan Guild Hall on Xiexu Branch Road (Liyuan Road) off Xieqiao Road in the Nanshi district, caught fire due to carelessness. The flames spread rapidly, destroying more than ten factory buildings and affecting the houses of Xie Changen, Zhang Changxing, and others at numbers 46 to 50 on the same street, resulting in eight completely burned down bungalow houses. Fire brigades from various districts in the Nanshi area rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire after an hour. The losses are reported to be substantial, but fortunately, no one was injured. Ms. Zhang Gu, a young woman from Ningbo, residing in room number 20 of the First Hotel in an alley next to the Grand Theater on Hankou Road, suddenly had a moment of despair at 10:30 PM last night. She secretly ingested poisonous liquid and attempted suicide. A hotel employee discovered her and immediately reported it to the police, who summoned an ambulance to transport her to Renji Hospital for treatment. It is said that she ingested too much poison, and her life is in danger. After investigation, it was found that she resided at 3 Deming Lane, Pushi Road in the French Concession. Her suicide was due to economic hardship. Around 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, a man, identified as A, was walking near Jiaozhou Road and Singapore Road in the western part of Shanghai. Suddenly, three thugs jumped out from the side of the road. Two of them drew sharp knives, surrounding the man and preventing him from making any noise. As a result, he was robbed of 25 French currency and the thugs fled with the loot.</p>

<h3>Xin'an Children's Touring Group - 30,000 Li Long March - Sending Representatives to Unite Overseas Chinese - And Hoping for the Efforts of Children on the Isolated Island</h3>
<p>The Xin'an Children's Touring Group, the only one of its kind in the country, consisting of sixteen members, with Zhang Jie as the head, Zai Dazhi as the advisor, and Tao Xingzhi as the teacher, set off from Huaian, Northern Jiangsu, on the Double Tenth Festival of 1935. Group leader Zhang Jie once came to Shanghai from the war zone. When he was in Shanghai, a reporter from the New Sound News Agency paid him a special visit and learned that the group, after departing from Northern Jiangsu, had passed through Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, and Shanghai, Nanjing, Beiping, Wuhan and other provinces and cities, as well as more than three hundred small county towns and villages, covering a journey of more than 30,000 li. Now it has a history of eight years. In the places where the group has walked, more than four million people have been awakened, they understand the meaning of the war of resistance, and actively participate in various front and rear tasks. More than five or six hundred thousand children, we have met and made the dearest friends, and have been doing various anti-war propaganda and services in various places. The youngest member of the working group is only eight years old, and the oldest is only seventeen or eighteen years old. Now there will be fifty people. Recently, the headquarters will go to the Northwest to work, but a part of the people will be left in Guilin to organize a new Southwest Working Team, which will work in the southwest and southeast provinces in the future. Recently, a twelve-year-old member was sent alone to foreign countries to promote and call on overseas Chinese children to unite and participate in the motherland's war of resistance. On the one hand, I am sent to meet with the war zone and forced children, hoping to establish a communication office and realize the union and unity of children across the country. At the same time, I also hope that the children on the isolated island will not be deceived by the corrupt.</p>
<h3>Sons of Party, Government, and Military Officials Enthusiastically Enlist - Many Women Also Voluntarily Receive Training - Overseas Chinese Technical Personnel Return to the Country</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the people of the whole country have contributed their material, financial and human resources to the best of their ability, and the conscription in various places has proceeded smoothly. Since the National Government advocated that the sons of party, government, and military officials should take the lead in serving in the military and set an example for the people, various provinces, cities, and counties have promoted this movement. The sons of party, government, and military officials who are of military age (18 to 45 years old) have enthusiastically enlisted. Those who are eligible for deferment have also voluntarily enlisted or entered military schools for training. Currently, many women in the interior have also voluntarily enlisted and received training, so the replenishment of soldiers is extremely abundant. Overseas Chinese have also voluntarily enlisted, and various technical personnel have returned to the country to serve, coming in an endless stream.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Bank Shanghai Branch - Opens Today</h3>
<p>Nanjing Commercial Savings Bank, initiated by Zhang Jingjiang, Chu Minyi, Zhang Jingqiu, and others, was established on March 1, 1935. The head office is located in Nanjing, with Zhang Jingjiang as chairman and Zhang Jingqiu as manager. The capital is set at one million national currency. After the fall of Nanjing, the head office moved to Chongqing. Now, a Shanghai branch has been established, located at 80 Jiujiang Road, and is scheduled to open today. The Shanghai branch manager will be concurrently held by General Manager Zhang Jingqiu, with Zhu Kaiguan as deputy manager and Zhuang Ruiwu as assistant manager.</p>
<h3>Xu Xingzhou - Has Regained Freedom</h3>
<p>Xu Xingzhou, commander of the 3rd Regiment of the 45th Independent Brigade in Puxi, has had all his subordinate units incorporated into the 8th Detachment of the Loyal Patriotic Salvation Army First Column since last month due to a conflict with a friendly army. He himself was once placed under house arrest by the 8th Detachment. Now, because Detachment Commander Ding Xisan felt that he had indeed worked hard and loyally for the country and the nation in the past, He Xingjian, the deputy column commander, approved his release. He regained his freedom on the 1st of this month.</p>
<h3>Copper Auxiliary Currency Notes - Market Urgently Needs - Copper Coins Have No Formal Market Price, Substitutes Are Used - Rumor That the Ministry of Finance's Auxiliary Currency Notes Are Being Printed in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued an order strictly prohibiting the private export of copper coins, those who violated the order would have all their goods confiscated and be punished according to the law of disrupting finance. Under special circumstances, Shanghai copper coins and coppers were almost completely collected and supplied to a certain party as military equipment. As a result, a serious shortage occurred, and transactions in various industries were greatly affected. Small vegetable markets were originally places where copper coins or coppers were collected. In the past, every time the market closed, vendors would exchange copper coins or coppers for national currency at a discounted price at stores. But this is no longer the case, because copper coins are rarely seen in the vegetable market, causing panic about giving change. Therefore, for purchases below five cents, the coins were refused to give the change. In order to make up for the difficulties, most shops currently use stamps as alternative chips, only those who have obtained stamps cannot use them in stores, so the accumulation of the stores is becoming too difficult. As the number becomes too large, there is no need to send a large number of letters, so the difficulty is also felt. The post office cannot sell more stamps to the stores, so this kind of the stores are creating an obvious pain to the citizens. Therefore, the issuance of one-cent and two-cent auxiliary currency notes is urgently needed. It is heard that these auxiliary currency notes will be issued by the Ministry of Finance and printed in Shanghai, and are currently being rushed to produce. It is rumored that five-cent notes will also be printed.</p>
<p>Profiteers Collect</p>
<p>The one-cent and half-cent copper coins and old coppers minted by the Central Mint that circulate in the Shanghai market were originally very numerous. After the war, profiteers bought them in large quantities and supplied them to a certain party as military equipment. First, they collected old Qing Guangxu coppers with thicker quality, and then, due to the soaring copper prices overseas, ordinary profiteers continued to collect Republic of China flag coppers and one-cent and half-cent copper coins. It is heard that 250 old coppers are worth 3 national currency, and 100 copper coins are worth 1.20 national currency. Therefore, profiteers seek profit and collect them in large quantities from the market, and transport them to a port, where they are loaded onto ships for export to a certain party.</p>
<p>Main Reason for Market Shortage</p>
<p>The Central Bank had previously signed a contract with the tram company and others to collect copper coins and was responsible for issuing new copper coins to circulate in the Shanghai market. After the war, it collected old copper coins and was forced to stop due to the environment. However, it continued to be responsible for issuing new copper coins to circulate in the market. Now, due to the large-scale purchase by profiteers and the government's inability to enforce the ban, it had to suspend the supply. At the same time, because profiteers still buy the coins and causing a shortage of copper coins in the Shanghai market, which has a great impact on all industries.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate No Longer Has Formal Market Price</p>
<p>Most tobacco shops on the market still refuse to exchange auxiliary paper currency for copper auxiliary coins. Occasionally, they exchange one corner of auxiliary paper currency for eight cents of copper auxiliary coins, or one yuan of national currency for eighty one-cent copper coins. Those who exchange feel that there is no difficulty in shopping without copper coins, so even though they know they are losing out, they are willing to do so and do not feel resentful. The Shanghai Tram Company has also issued a notice stating, "Please pay the appropriate fare to the ticket seller, and the ticket seller does not need to give change in copper coins." The public bus company has re-issued the coins that have been collected and replaced copper coins for circulation. The tobacco shops have removed the signs for exchanging copper coins, indicating that there is no formal market price, but they exchange them secretly. Old copper coins are exchanged at 2,500 cash coins per yuan, and new copper coins at 90 per yuan, but they do not allow large amounts to be exchanged. For zero transactions in various industries, stamps or revenue stamps are used instead. Copper coins are also rarely seen in transactions in small vegetable markets. It is heard that the export of Chinese copper coins is 7 million pieces per month, and the collectors are all Japanese military arms dealers, and it is said that most of them flow out of Shanghai.</p>
<h3>French Concession Board of Directors Promulgates - Regulations for the Prevention of Rabies</h3>
<p>The French Concession Board of Directors has now formulated seven articles of regulations for the prevention of rabies, which are transcribed as follows:</p>
<p>Chapter 1. General Provisions. Article 1. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to any animal that has one of the following conditions: (a) suffering from rabies; (b) suspected of suffering from rabies, that is, having been bitten or contacted by another animal suffering from rabies.</p>
<p>Chapter 2. Regulations Concerning People. Article 2. Any person who is bitten by an animal suspected of having rabies and is infected, or whose body has a newly received wound and is contaminated by the saliva of an animal suspected of having rabies, or who only has contact with an animal suspected of having rabies, and this animal dies or disappears after being found to be in a suspicious state, must undergo treatment at the Shanghai Pasteur Institute, and the cost shall be borne by the Board of Directors. This anti-rabies treatment is even more necessary in the following circumstances: (1) The animal that bit the person dies or is slaughtered within twelve days, regardless of whether the animal has been injected with the vaccine or not; (2) The animal that bit the person has not been identified or disappears within twelve days; (3) If the animal that bit the person is still alive, but its anti-rabies vaccination is over one year, the treatment of the bitten person shall be temporarily suspended on the sixth day when the animal is proven to have no suspicion of rabies. If the animal becomes mad, sick, or dies of disease during the inspection period on the sixth and twelfth days, the bitten person shall remain and continue treatment. If the animal that bit the person is still alive and under inspection, and has been vaccinated against rabies for less than one year, if the bitten person is in serious condition, it is advisable to start anti-rabies immediately. In other cases, wait for the results of the animal's examination.</p>
<p>Chapter 3. Regulations Concerning Animals. Article 3. When an animal that has bitten a person is encountered, it should not be slaughtered as far as possible. Regardless of whether it has been vaccinated against rabies or not, it should be captured and sent to a licensed veterinarian for examination for twelve days. (a) If the animal under examination dies during the examination period, the veterinarian shall immediately report to the Director of the Public Health Relief Department. Any animal that dies within twelve days after biting a person, regardless of the cause of death, shall be regarded as suspected of having rabies. (b) If the animal is still alive, the veterinarian shall issue a rabies-free certificate on the sixth and twelfth days of the examination and submit it to the Director of the Public Health Relief Department. The examination fee and certificate shall be borne by the animal owner. If it is a stray dog, the fee shall be borne by the Public Health Department. Article 4. Any animal that is proven to have rabies, regardless of its type and whether it has bitten a person or not, shall be immediately slaughtered. Any dog, cat, or other general animal that is bitten or contacted by a rabid animal shall also be slaughtered immediately. Article 5. If some animals are bitten or contacted by a rabid animal, the Director of the Public Health Department may direct and apply the following methods: (1) For dogs that have been vaccinated for the first time for more than twenty days and have been revaccinated for less than one year, the animal may be kept by its owner at its own risk, but should be vaccinated again within seven days after being bitten or contacted, otherwise it should be slaughtered immediately. The certificate of vaccination and revaccination shall be immediately submitted to the Director of the Public Health Department, and the dog shall be under the supervision of a veterinarian for a period of four months. During this period, it shall not walk on the road unless accompanied by someone. (2) For grass-eating animals or pigs, the animal shall be examined at the veterinarian's office for three months and shall be marked with a special mark. The animal owner shall not sell it during the examination period, but may slaughter it within eight days after being bitten with the consent of the Board of Directors' veterinarian, and all costs shall be borne by the animal owner. Article 6. Stray dogs. All stray dogs found on the road shall be captured and detained. If no owner claims them after three days, they shall be slaughtered. If they are suspected of being ill, the dogs claimed by their owners during the period shall be examined for a considerable period and shall only be returned when they are deemed to be free of disease, and the owner shall bear all costs.</p>

<h3>Playboy Swindler Jiang Qiu - Transferred to the Second Special Court - The First Special Court Sentenced Him to Five Years in Prison - Many Cases Were Also Committed in the French Concession - Stolen Goods Such as Decorations Were Dragged Out</h3>
<p>Jiang Jianqiu from Nanjing, also known as Ye Jianming, is 25 years old this year, of medium build, has an ordinary appearance, is good at talking, and has been jailed for committing crimes. In prison, he studied the magic of seducing women. After being released from prison, he used the means of deceiving women. The first person to be deceived was a prostitute. After sleeping with the prostitute, he pawned the prostitute's clothing and decorations. Then he used the same method to deceive the guides of various guide companies. He used the money he cheated to buy the most fashionable clothes, and went in and out of various parks and major cinemas, attacking young mistresses and aunts. Therefore, there were more than ten cases in the French Concession where young mistresses and aunts who loved the style of light were seduced and gave him gold ornaments or money. Last month, Jiang was arrested by the Public Concession Police Station and sent to the First Special Court for a sentence of five years in prison. The victims in the Public Concession were all prostitutes, dancers and female guides, but most of the 20 victims in the French Concession were mistresses and aunts.</p>
<p>Is the young mistress</p>
<p>and aunt, the French Concession authorities sent people to transfer Jiang to the case and ordered Detective Sui Wenzhi to investigate. Because most of the victims were unwilling to come forward to testify, the investigation procedures were more difficult. The French Concession authorities escorted Jiang Jianqiu to the Criminal Division VIII of the Second Special Court a few days ago, requesting remand for investigation. Magistrate Qiu Xiansheng sat in the chair and questioned him. The defendant Jiang Jianqiu confessed to committing many crimes in the French Concession. Sui Wenzhi, the detective in charge of the case, reported to the court that the defendant Jiang Jianqiu in this case</p>
<p>is a big swindler</p>
<p>and also a big thief, but the victims are all young mistresses and aunts from noble families. It can be said that the defendant is a romantic thief. Although gold ornaments and other objects have now been dragged out, it will take a long time to investigate. The court inquired and ordered the defendant Jiang to be remanded in custody for questioning again on June 21. It is heard that in addition to the young mistresses and aunts, there is also the wife of a Westerner, the manager of a large hotel. Jiang cheated them out of gold red envelopes and gold ornaments worth about tens of thousands of yuan in a few months.</p>

<h3>The Future of Black Market Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>— By Bao Leti</p>
<p>Automatic Adjustment, Not Forced Collapse</p>
<p>Nothing is more startling than the recent drastic changes in the black market exchange rates. However, looking at the course of these drastic changes, the cause was clearly the HSBC's automatic adjustment of exchange rates, and even the automatic cessation of selling foreign exchange. This is fundamentally different from a forced collapse, with a clear distinction between subject and object. Although HSBC is a British bank, because it is a major player in the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, it implicitly acted as the representative of the Chinese Ministry of Finance in the black market for foreign exchange. This action of theirs was based on the authorization of the Ministry of Finance, acting on orders. There is no reason to strike oneself. Based on common sense alone, one knows that this sharp drop in the exchange rate is a change in the Chinese government's policy on foreign exchange management, and has nothing to do with the security of the legal tender itself.</p>
<p>Several Ridiculous Speculations in the Market</p>
<p>However, when HSBC initially adjusted the exchange rate against the British pound from eight pence to seven point seven five pence on the morning of the seventh, rumors spread in the market, and all sorts of gossip arose. Some made far-fetched political connections, maliciously slandering, even saying that this was a means by which Europe and the United States were beginning to force mediation of the Sino-Japanese war. Some made reckless speculations about the Exchange Equalization Fund, creating rumors and undermining confidence, even saying that China's foreign exchange reserves had lost more than half due to long-term trade deficits and the illicit buying by the Japanese and puppet regimes. Some asserted that the Chinese government had decided to change its policy of controlling foreign exchange, implementing a devaluation of the currency, and even moving the agency supplying foreign exchange from Shanghai to Hong Kong. Furthermore, because various parties were eagerly awaiting the Ministry of Finance to announce measures to deal with the aftermath of this drastic change in the exchange rate, but the Ministry of Finance remained silent, not revealing any opinion in the past two and a half days, it made people even more suspicious and worried about whether there would be problems with the legal tender itself. In addition, the circulation of copper subsidiary coins in Shanghai gradually contracted, and public transport companies explicitly revealed news of a shortage of copper coins. This strengthened the public's psychology of hoarding copper coins, even to the point of using various substitutes, and even using postage stamps as change. This made people even more pessimistic about the future of the legal tender. Rumors of issuing "drawing slips" and withdrawing five-yuan and ten-yuan legal tender banknotes took the opportunity to resurface.</p>
<p>Statement by the Spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Until now, although the Ministry of Finance has not yet issued a formal order regarding the measures to deal with the aftermath of the black market for foreign exchange, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance, in answering questions from journalists on the tenth, swept away the above-mentioned doubts. Furthermore, from the content of this answer and the illegal nature of the black market where the turmoil occurred, it is likely that the Ministry of Finance will not issue any formal orders.</p>
<p>In answering questions, the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance formally pointed out that HSBC's adjustment of exchange rates and restriction of foreign exchange sales had been approved by the Ministry of Finance. At the same time, he earnestly reiterated the determination to maintain the legal tender and indicated the authorities' future policy for managing foreign exchange. The spokesperson's explanation was divided into five points, the main points being:</p>
<p>(1) Maintaining the legal tender is the established policy of the Chinese government. The methods used by the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee to adjust foreign exchange market prices recently have not been changed, and the government's policy is also a measure approved by the government.</p>
<p>(2) Due to seasonal factors in imports and exports, imports are currently increasing, especially the import of non-essential goods. Therefore, adjusting foreign exchange market prices to meet standards that are beneficial to the Chinese economy and maintain a balance of international payments will further consolidate the foreign exchange market.</p>
<p>(3) The government's maintenance of the legal tender's legal price has remained unchanged before and after the war of resistance. Since the management of foreign exchange, public and private institutions that have legitimate needs for foreign exchange, approved by the Ministry of Finance, have been sold foreign exchange by the Central Bank at the legal price. This fact is obvious. As for the difference between the market price and the legal price, since foreign exchange has been managed, this phenomenon is not unique to China.</p>
<p>(4) The government has repeatedly instructed banks to maintain the market in order to reduce market fluctuations, and the results have been quite good. After the establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee, the management mechanism has become even more perfect, and the strength of maintenance has been further increased.</p>
<p>(5) Recently, the government has been striving to reduce the import of non-essential goods and has been devising various methods to encourage exports, while also saving foreign exchange, hoping to benefit China's economy and adapt to the needs of the war of resistance. The strength of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee is sufficient to stabilize the market situation. I firmly believe that all parties' confidence in the legal tender will be further enhanced and will not be affected by current market fluctuations.</p>
<p>Information Revealed from This</p>
<p>The wording of this statement is undeniably ambiguous. However, we can at least discover the authorities' active views on foreign exchange control.</p>
<p>Needless to say: the authorities' established policy is to never change, which is to establish and maintain a monetary system suitable for the national economy and capable of serving as the basis for legitimate trade. Up to April 6, China's foreign exchange policy clearly adopted a dual system, or it can be said to have adopted a two-track system. This means that on the one hand, the Central Bank's operations maintained an exchange rate of one shilling and two pence, so that imports that the government considered legal were not adversely affected by exchange rate fluctuations. All imports that had been applied for and approved were always sold foreign exchange by the Central Bank at the legal price of one shilling and two pence. But on the other hand, the operations of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee maintained a black market price of eight pence against the British pound. This effect is clearly threefold: First, to prevent speculators from taking advantage of the black market for foreign exchange to stir up trouble; second, to ensure that various imports that have not been approved by the Central Bank are not subject to greater losses due to the constant fluctuations in the black market for foreign exchange; and third, to believe that this black market exchange rate, which is more than 40% lower than the legal rate, can at least implicitly restrict various unnecessary imports. In a nutshell: this dual system is to maintain legitimate import trade and protect legitimate import trade with a legal exchange rate that is more than 40% higher than the black market price. At the same time, it uses a black market exchange rate that is more than 40% lower than the legal rate to restrict imports that are not conducive to China's wartime economy, and stabilizes the foreign credit of the legal tender by stabilizing this black market.</p>
<p>This dual foreign exchange control method has clearly not been changed by this adjustment. In other words: the Central Bank will continue to maintain the legal exchange rate and continue to provide foreign exchange to approved importers. And the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee will continue to operate in the black market, thereby stabilizing exchange rates in the black market. However, whether the black market exchange rate will still be stabilized at the level of April 6 is being reconsidered. Moreover, the black market exchange rate under consideration is hoped to be stable at a level that can implicitly restrict unnecessary imports.</p>
<p>Eight Pence and Import and Export Trade</p>
<p>Before the establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, the black market exchange rate in Shanghai had been stable at the level of eight pence for more than nine months. At that time, there was no equalization mechanism in existence, and of course there was no equalization operation relationship. The emergence and stability of this eight-pence black market rate was entirely accidental, and there was no theoretical basis whatsoever.</p>
<p>The Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee was established and took this eight-pence black market exchange rate as the standard for equalization operations. There is no reason whatsoever, except to assume that it is in line with purchasing power parity. But as mentioned earlier: In addition to eliminating speculative activities and reducing the foreign exchange losses of unauthorized imports, the mission of the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee is also to restrict various unnecessary imports and promote the export of domestic products.</p>
<p>However, according to the recent trend of sharp increases in import trade, this eight-pence black market exchange rate, which is lower than the legal exchange rate, is obviously unable to restrain general import trade, especially in Shanghai: The value of imports in the first four months of this year reached 185.7 million yuan, nearly doubling from 68.7 million yuan in the same period last year, accounting for 46.8% of the total value of national imports.</p>
<p>However, It is Completely Different From Devaluation</p>
<p>After the foreign exchange control was implemented last year, there was a period when the exchange rate in the black market drastically diverged from the legal price and fell, until the black market exchange rate naturally stabilized at the level of eight pence against the British pound. In the domestic academic community, there were many people who advocated that the legal price should also be appropriately devalued. The reasons for advocating devaluation of the legal price were nothing more than restricting imports and protecting domestic exports, and even promoting exports, and even attracting remittances from overseas Chinese back to the country as the most powerful. However, in addition to firmly maintaining the foreign credit of the legal tender and refusing to take any action on this, the government authorities have also been carrying out various means to achieve the above-mentioned goals in other aspects, and have achieved extraordinary results. For example, importers can only purchase foreign exchange at the legal price in a very small number of cases. Most of them purchase it at high prices in the black market, which has implicitly restricted imports. At the same time, most of the domestic transportation tools are in the hands of the state, and the state naturally selects imported goods according to their needs and the degree of their need. Secondary and even unnecessary imported goods have also been subject to strict restrictions on transportation. As for the purchase of military supplies from overseas, most of them have already implemented barter trade. The determination of the prices of goods from each other does not require the use of devaluation policies to manipulate. Therefore, it will no longer affect the development of export trade. As for remittances from overseas Chinese back to the country, there have been considerable gains solely from the development of their patriotic hearts, and the existence of the black market is also sufficient for overseas Chinese to choose from.</p>
<p>In the face of these facts, the government has no need to devalue the legal price, so this approval of HSBC's reduction of the black market exchange rate is, of course, completely different from a devaluation policy. Furthermore, we can obtain an opposite proof from the content of the second article of the statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance recorded above.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier: Currently, because of seasonal factors, imports are quite high, especially the import of non-essential goods has increased even more. Therefore, it is necessary to adjust foreign exchange market prices based on standards that are beneficial to the Chinese economy and maintain a balance of international payments. It is clear that the future level of the equalization black market price will be quite different from the past in terms of method.</p>
<p>(1) The Central Bank will always maintain the legal price of one shilling and two pence, and will certainly not change it. However, the Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee will abandon the policy of freezing at a certain point (like pegging at eight pence) in its equalization operations in the black market, and will adapt to changing circumstances and take measures appropriate to the occasion based on standards that are beneficial to the Chinese economy and with reference to the seasonal factors of imports and exports.</p>
<p>(2) Although the equalization standard will be adapted to changing circumstances, it must take whether or not it is beneficial to the Chinese economy as the principle of selection. This is clearly completely different from the past pegging policy. Therefore, the new level that will appear in the future is by no means an immutable level. It can be smaller than eight pence, and it can be larger than eight pence.</p>
<p>Crushing the Japanese and Puppet Regimes' Conspiracy to Buy Up</p>
<p>Although everyone knows that Japan relies on the excessive issuance of inconvertible paper money to plunder raw materials and local products from Chinese occupied areas. Besides transporting a portion to its own country to supply its factories for consumption, it also resells another portion of unnecessary items to Shanghai and other parts of China, thereby absorbing legal tender in order to buy up foreign exchange. Needless to say, this scheme of theirs must take the unlimited supply of the black market as a prerequisite, and at the same time, it must have a stable black market exchange rate in order to obtain sufficient profits. Especially in recent months, when the Japanese yen has drastically depreciated against the legal tender and the black market exchange rate of the legal tender has been stable for a long time, the necessity and benefits of their buying up legal tender foreign exchange have become even greater. According to recent reports: they are currently using this method to purchase large quantities of cotton and wheat from overseas for their factories in Shanghai. However, due to this reduction in the foreign exchange black market, it is impossible to import. From this, it can be seen that this drastic change is completely in line with the "national policy of resistance."</p>
<p>However, merely reducing the black market exchange rate to combat the Japanese and puppet regimes' conspiracy to buy up legal tender foreign exchange is absolutely insufficient in reality. Unless it is possible to also devise methods to restrict the supply of foreign exchange in the black market at the same time. Although, during the drastic change in the exchange market, there was once a rumor that the "location of foreign exchange supply would be moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong," there is absolutely no such indication in the statement by the spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance. Although this is a major regret, it is sufficient to reflect the fact that the government authorities are mindful of the convenience of Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai, and to reflect the strength of China's foreign exchange reserves.</p>
<h3>New Measures for Legal Tender Exchange</h3>
<p>— By Gong Jialin</p>
<p>Since the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund Committee in Hong Kong telegraphed Shanghai on the morning of the seventh to temporarily suspend the sale of foreign exchange, a huge storm has been stirred up in the Shanghai exchange market: in two days, it has fallen from eight pence two five to six pence half. The prices of hardware and imported goods in the market have risen, and the price of gold has also been subject to speculative manipulation, rising endlessly. The public, although still ultimately maintaining trust in the legal tender, those with poorer judgment are inevitably agitated by rumors and show panic. Although the Ministry of Finance has not yet issued a formal order regarding the detailed measures for this action, based on the gathering of information from various parties and our own speculation, the government seems to have decided to stabilize the new exchange rate at around six pence half, so as to make it adapt to the balance of international payments, and to impose appropriate restrictions on the supply of foreign exchange in the open market thereafter. Now, we will clarify the points that are prone to misunderstanding by the public regarding these new measures, and describe their significance below.</p>
<p>(1) The Government's Change of Exchange Rate Equalization Does Not Mean Abandoning the Policy of Maintaining the Legal Tender Exchange Rate</p>
<p>We must first point out to everyone that the government's support for the market price of the legal tender did not begin with the establishment of the Sino-British Exchange Equalization Fund in March of this year; therefore, this temporary suspension of foreign exchange supply by the Equalization Fund is by no means saying that the government will henceforth disregard the market exchange rate. We know that when the government implemented the foreign exchange application and approval law in March of last year, it used gradually reducing approval amounts to ease the decline in the exchange rate. After mid-June, the government even joined forces with HSBC to maintain the exchange rate at a standard of more than eight pence, in order to eliminate the forces of speculation. This exchange rate has been maintained for a long time of ten or more months. In March of this year, in order to strengthen the operational mechanism for stabilizing the exchange rate, it was established with the United Kingdom an Exchange Equalization Fund, in order to place exchange rate stabilization on a stronger foundation. However, we must understand that the policy of establishing this Exchange Equalization Fund to stabilize exchange rates is just like our country's basic military strategy of resisting the war, it is not something that should spare no cost to defend any place. It is not only proper for the government to take expedient measures in consideration of market conditions, but it is also necessary. Today, the government, in view of the sudden increase in non-essential imports, devalues the black market exchange rate to adjust trade, and may raise the exchange rate again in the future due to the movement of the international economic situation. This is equally possible and equally proper.</p>
<p>(2) This Action by the Government is Automatic and Positive.</p>
<p>A country's intervention in the exchange market can be divided into two types: positive and passive. The Chinese government is now stabilizing the black market exchange rate at a new standard, adopting a preemptive positive means. This means that this new measure is by no means forced to suspend sales due to the depletion of foreign exchange funds, but is to strengthen preparations to prevent problems before they occur. We have several very strong bases:</p>
<p>(1) Since the establishment of the Exchange Equalization Fund in mid-March to the beginning of this month, it has only been two and a half months. Even according to the most extreme estimate, the 10 million pound Equalization Fund can at least maintain the exchange rate of eight pence for more than a year and a half. There is no reason to use it up in two and a half months. Moreover, the government now has a considerable amount of foreign exchange obtained from export control, which can be used to supplement it at any time, making the Exchange Fund even more consolidated.</p>
<p>(2) Although the two types of counterfeit banknotes in the north and south have tried their best to obtain foreign exchange, according to reliable estimates by foreigners, the legal tender obtained by the "United Bank Notes" in the year since their issuance is not even one-tenth of the amount of legal tender in circulation in North China (i.e., about 30 million yuan), and since the issuance of the "Hua Xing Notes", due to obstacles in circulation, it has only been more than 200,000 yuan. Therefore, the pressure of counterfeit banknotes on the legal tender foreign exchange in these two and a half months is not very great either.</p>
<p>(3) The Chinese government's deposits and cash silver reserves abroad are very sufficient, and there are also loans and remittances from overseas Chinese to replenish them from time to time. Since the start of the war, they have only increased and not decreased. If necessary, it is easy to use a portion of them to maintain the exchange rate of eight pence one five.</p>
<p>(4) Since the implementation of the legal tender policy in 1935, the British and American governments have been making every effort to assist China. The stability of the legal tender is of great benefit to British and American investors with significant vested interests in China. If the legal tender cannot maintain stability, how can they not provide support. It is clear that this action is the result of prudent discussions between China and the parties involved, and is a completely planned and positive policy.</p>
<p>(3) The Significance of the New Measures</p>
<p>Under a managed currency system, the exchange rate of a country's currency is not immutable. If an exchange rate is no longer suitable for national conditions, then maintaining it is not only useless, but also harmful. Especially in Shanghai, the economic center of the occupied area, the government has lost its ability to govern politically. There is indeed room for consideration in the unlimited supply of foreign exchange in the black market. We have said this opinion a long time ago; until recently, with the establishment of the counterfeit "Hua Xing Bank" and the attempt to use the old trick of the "United Bank" in North China to exchange legal tender for counterfeit money to obtain foreign exchange in Central China, we feel even more that the government needs to further control foreign exchange (see my article "The Issuance Policy of Hua Xing Bank and Its Future"). It is now heard that the government intends to adjust the currency exchange rate and stipulate that in the future, legitimate merchants who are unable to apply to the Central Bank for legal foreign exchange can purchase foreign exchange from foreign banks without restrictions with a fixed order form. This action is exactly what we want. Analyzed, it has at least the following four points of value.</p>
<p>(1) Adjusting Trade: One point in the trade of various commercial ports in China in recent months is quite noteworthy, that is, the ports under the government's jurisdiction all have a trade surplus, while the major commercial ports in the occupied areas have huge trade deficits due to the government's lack of power. This division is very obvious: According to customs statistics, in the first quarter of this year, the main ports under the government's control totaled Mengzi with a surplus of 8,121,000 yuan, Huanzhou with a surplus of 285,000 yuan, Leizhou with a surplus of 2,448,000 yuan, Shantou with a surplus of 5,038,000 yuan, and Wenzhou with a surplus of 4,032,000 yuan, totaling about 20 million yuan in surplus in these five places; but in the occupied areas, the two ports of Tianjin alone have a deficit of more than 90 million yuan. Although the government cannot correct this phenomenon by direct methods, it is indeed a smart way to temporarily withdraw the support of the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund in the market, and then find a suitable exchange rate to stabilize it. In today's occupied areas, the government cannot use political power to control trade, and this is probably the only effective way.</p>
<p>(2) Reducing Imports of Japanese Goods: In view of the gradual depletion of Japan's gold reserves, Japan has been striving to promote the sale of a portion of its surplus commodities (that is, those that cannot be sold overseas at a good price) to the Chinese occupied areas in order to absorb foreign exchange. However, they are not willing to recover the Japanese yen and military notes in China, so they exchange these banknotes for legal tender, and then transfer foreign exchange. Recently, the export control in North China limited the export of certain local goods to be settled in foreign currency, which is also the reason. The result of the sale of surplus commodities is a sharp increase in Japanese goods imported into China: in the first quarter of this year, it reached as high as 70 million to 80 million yuan, ranking first among the values of goods imported into China from various countries. The legal tender reserves for this huge amount of imports have all been absorbed by the Japanese. If the Equalization Committee restricts the purchase of foreign exchange by the legal tender, then Japan's exports to China will inevitably not be able to obtain foreign exchange (referring to US dollars, British pounds, etc.), or will be exchanged for foreign exchange at a greater cost, then the import of Japanese goods will be reduced invisibly.</p>
<p>(3) Preventing Counterfeit Money From Obtaining Foreign Exchange: The establishment and issuance of banknotes by the counterfeit "Hua Xing Bank" in Central China in the middle of last month is undoubtedly also one of the reasons for this new measure. We remember that when the "United Bank" in North China was established last year, the government implemented the foreign exchange application and approval law, so it is not surprising that the government once again strengthened control with the establishment of—Hua Xing—. Although the circulation amount of "Hua Xing Bank" banknotes is still limited now, we have various reasons to speculate that the Hua Xing Notes—will inevitably tend to expand in the future. In order to prevent problems before they occur, it is necessary to add prevention to the old trick of absorbing legal tender with counterfeit banknotes to obtain foreign exchange.</p>
<p>(4) Making the Planned Export Control in Central China by the Japanese and Puppet Regimes Meaningless: The export of occupied areas is one of the main supplies of foreign exchange in the black market. If the puppet organization really comes out of the way of controlling export foreign exchange (whether it can be done or not is another matter), then the supply of foreign exchange in the black market will inevitably decrease, and the Japanese side's plan to obtain foreign exchange will inevitably be more difficult to implement. It is eating its own fruit.</p>
<p>(4) The Strength of the Legal Tender and the Weakness of the Japanese Yen</p>
<p>After the violent decline of the legal tender exchange rate, the Japanese yen in the Shanghai market, although slightly stronger, is far from reaching the standard it should have reached. On June 7, the day before the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee restricted the supply of foreign exchange in the black market, the price of the Japanese yen in Shanghai was 92 cents, and the price of the legal tender was 8 pence 25; recently, when the legal tender fell to 6 pence half, the Japanese yen should have risen to 1 yuan 17 cents, but in reality it is still hovering within 1 yuan, unable to break through par, which seems quite intriguing. In fact, this is not very difficult to explain. Although the Japanese yen in Japan still maintains an official price of one shilling and two pence on the surface due to the government's strong control, due to the country's financial difficulties, currency inflation, depletion of reserves, deterioration of trade, restrictions on the domestic and foreign use of the Japanese yen, and the gradual failure of the war against China, even Japanese citizens with a strong sense of patriotism have expressed pessimism about the future of the Japanese yen. The depreciation of the Japanese yen shown in the open market in Shanghai is the best evidence. Conversely, the legal tender's reserves are still abundant, it can freely purchase and trade goods domestically, and it can freely exchange foreign exchange abroad. The Japanese also firmly believe in the foundation of the legal tender, so as soon as the exchange rate is slightly favorable, they desperately exchange Japanese yen for legal tender, and as a result, the supply of Japanese yen in the market exceeds demand, and the exchange rate naturally falls back again. This simple fact has already shown us the solid foundation of the legal tender by the Japanese themselves, so why should we doubt it?</p>

<h3>A Review and Outlook on the Sino-Japanese Currency War</h3>
<p>— Anshi</p>
<p>1. The Seriousness of the Sino-Japanese Currency War</p>
<p>In modern warfare, victory or defeat can be said to depend on the strength of the economic foundation. The reason why the National Government advocates long-term resistance is also based on the fact that Japan's economic foundation is fragile and cannot withstand a single blow. However, the production methods of capitalists take commodity exchange as a condition for their existence, and commercial exchange must take currency as a medium, so in a certain sense, economic warfare can also be said to be currency warfare. On the front line, there is the hand-to-hand combat of loyal men and soldiers, and in the rear (especially in the occupied areas and the concessions), the legal tender is also constantly engaged in fierce battles with Japanese banknotes and counterfeit coins. If in the future someone writes the record of this Sino-Japanese War and casually dismisses the glorious battle record of this warrior (legal tender), that war record must</p>
<p>I don't have time to talk about the monetary policies of various countries towards China before August 13. However, we must know that in a certain sense, China's monetary policy in this Sino-Japanese War can be said to be one of the reasons why Japan had to risk a desperate gamble. Therefore, Japan's policy towards the legal tender is actually of very important significance and practical nature. Because of the solid foundation of the legal tender and the nationalization of silver, Japan foresaw the difficulties and obstacles of the monetary war against China at the beginning of the war. Even in North China, which they were confident would be relatively problem-free, they tasted a lot of hardship! (To be continued)</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance   Hong Kong Dealers Continue to Inquire; Cash Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the unofficial market for current silver dollars remained stable.  Due to the Sunday holiday, few members were present.  Reportedly, the market was very strong. Although Hong Kong dealers had aggressively bought at the high price of $2,280 the day before, there was still a profit of $100 to be made by shipping to Hong Kong.  Therefore, there was continued interest.  Numerous inquiries were made at money exchange shops, with offers of $2,475.  However, sellers were asking for $2,485.  The exchange rate for gold jewelry remained unchanged.  Da Tong Hang was still quoting $250.  Xin Tong Hang was at $248 for selling and $242 for buying.  Furthermore, according to a London cable dated the 10th, the price of pure gold remained fixed at £7 8s 5d per ounce.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Prices Continue to Weaken</h3>
<p>According to London cables, Indian silver sales lacked support, and the market remained flat.  The spread between near and far term contracts narrowed by 0.0625.  A New York silver cable reported that spot prices remained unchanged.  A Bombay silver cable stated that Indian silver was weak, with spot prices down 5 annas, June futures down 6 annas, and July futures down 9 annas.</p>
<h3>Trading Copper Coins: Profit and Loss, Nickel Coins and Small Change Also Robbed</h3>
<p>Recently, copper coins have become increasingly scarce, and small coins are also rare. Making change in small transactions has become quite difficult.  Taking public transportation or streetcars is especially inconvenient. Although various newspapers have reported on this issue, they have mostly offered superficial commentary and have failed to uncover the truth.  Here, I will describe the reasons for these purchases.</p>
<p>Two hundred copper coins weigh approximately 2.5 "jin" (approximately 2.75 pounds) on the market scale and can be sold for one yuan in legal tender, yielding a profit of 50%. The dragon-patterned copper coins from the late Qing dynasty are valued the highest and weigh the most. Certain parties collect them, store them in wine jars, and transport them by wheelbarrow. Those who collect, trade and transport these coins in China are mostly opium dealers and unscrupulous citizens. They search everywhere, or go to the countryside to buy, where they can purchase them for 20 to 30 fewer coins per yuan. After collecting them, they transport them to Hongkou. Fewer money exchange businesses are involved in the trading and transport of these coins, only a certain money shop north of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road.  Dozens of bags of coins have been seen being transported there.  These are truly examples of people flocking together. Other organized collectors, such as copper skin factories and foundries, melt the coins into copper ingots and sell them to goldsmith shops, shipyards, or export merchants, making even greater profits. The current market price for copper ingots of 99% purity is 85 yuan per "dan" (approximately 110 pounds). Copper ingots of 70% purity sell for 65 yuan per "dan." Foundry copper material sells for 50 yuan per "dan."</p>
<p>Small change used to be closely related to copper coins. Since the old ten-cash copper coins disappeared, opium dealers have stopped supplying them. Some exchanges offer ten-cent pieces, with the exchangers finding small coins to provide as change. The demand has become so great that there is now a black market. One yuan in legal tender can only buy 90 small coins, and even then it is difficult to obtain them. Certain parties are also very eager to buy small coins, offering only 80 small coins for one yuan in legal tender. With unbacked paper money, even buying ten or twenty small coins is like finding something for nothing, let alone obtaining more than that.</p>
<p>Nickel coins have not been in circulation for long, and the quantity is not large. After the Nationalist army moved west, nickel coins were shipped from Hong Kong to Shanghai. Recently, certain parties, relying on military force, searched foreign ships repeatedly and confiscated all nickel coins being transported to Shanghai.  The looting of the public is even harder to describe. With the source of nickel coins cut off, the number in circulation is decreasing daily. Furthermore, the material of nickel coins is more valuable than copper or lead, so they are being bundled up and taken away.</p>
<p>During the early Republic of China and the warlord era, excessive minting of copper coins in Hunan and Hubei resulted in large copper coins (worth 20 cash) being exchanged at over 300 coins per yuan, or over 600 single copper coins per yuan. Single copper coins from Hunan and Hubei flooded the market in Shanghai, causing the exchange rate to fall and prices to rise. After the January 28th Incident, one yuan could be exchanged for over 380 coins. When small coins first came into circulation, they were also exchanged at over 320 coins per yuan. In the past year or two, the rate has been fixed at the legal price and has not changed. Recently, certain parties have been collecting them in large quantities for use as raw materials for munitions. However, certain parties have been collecting copper coins and smuggling them out of the country for several years. Stevedores and sailors on Yangtze River steamers transport large copper coins and resell them to money shops in Hongkou, who then sell them to certain parties for private export. With so many people involved in the smuggling, the accumulated losses are incalculable. Counting the coastal ports and North China, the annual smuggling of copper coins reaches over 50 million yuan. What has been cast and accumulated over decades is flowing eastward in a torrent in the shortest period of time, and it is feared that this will not stop until everything is exhausted. The smuggling was especially rampant before the August 13th Incident in 1937. In North China, Japanese adventurers were engaged in large-scale smuggling. In Shanghai, when certain foreign ships were leaving the port, Japanese adventurers would travel in groups, openly carrying away gold bars, silver coins, and copper coins, refusing any interference. This cannot simply be described as smuggling. As the Jiangnan regions fell, the gold and silver sold in European and American markets were all treasures of our country. The recent soaring gold prices and plummeting exchange rates may also stem from the same causes as the outflow of gold, silver, and copper coins. (Yuan)</p>
<h3>Food  Speculators Active, Rice Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, shipments from upriver were blocked, and no goods arrived. However, wheelbarrow and "baozi" (steamed bun) dealers from the Sikhs area brought 3,400 to 3,500 packages. The market is currently using the price of foreign rice as a benchmark. After the excitement, the momentum remained strong yesterday. From the opening of the market, speculators continued to actively buy, and other businesses followed suit, causing the market to tighten. Local merchants also took the opportunity to enter the market, so sales were brisk. Sellers raised their prices. High-quality "Chang Jing" rice was bid at $18.50, but ultimately sold for $18. The prices of other northern and southern "Jing" rice varieties also rose by 2 to 3 "jiao" (10 "jiao" = 1 yuan). The price of top-grade "Bo Dao" rice only increased by one "jiao," as its price was already high, while ordinary "Shi" grade rice increased by 2 to 3 "jiao." "Du Yang Jian" and "Bu Ke Jian" rice varieties were also very active, similar to the "Jing" rice market, and prices increased by 3 "jiao."</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods Raw Peanuts Tighten</h3>
<p>Raw peanuts had previously arrived in shipments of over 4,000 packages. Two attempts to clear these holdings failed to result in any sales. However, since the changes in foreign exchange rates, the market has tightened. This is because the transportation from Qingdao to Shanghai has been restricted by certain parties, and the foreign exchange rate is also a factor. Yesterday, it was reported that over one hundred small packages were traded at a price of $19. The market price may increase slightly in the future.</p>
<h3>Longkou Noodles Scarce and Expensive</h3>
<p>Fine noodles and dried noodles have become scarce recently, and market prices have risen repeatedly. Longkou noodles are selling for as high as $80. It is reported that stores that stocked up earlier at high prices have been selling at a loss. In addition, Qingdao noodles are scarce, while Jiangbei noodles are commanding a high price of $33.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Prices Fluctuate Then Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no telegrams from London regarding the sugar market. According to a telegram from Hong Kong, the cost of coarse white sugar to Shanghai is HK$10.60, which is difficult to reconcile. However, the Shanghai Sugar Association's prices, which had been rising for several days, have now stabilized. Spot prices for "E4" grade coarse white sugar from local warehouses are at $29.20, while outside warehouses are still asking $29. 100 bags of re-exported sugar were traded at $29.70. Local warehouses sold 70 bags of "Da Jin Qian Ma Ke" sugar at $29.60. Taikoo brand white sugar: "B Mark" at $29, "C Mark" at $28.80, "CX Mark" at $18.50, "DY Mark" at $27.40, "HX Mark" at $27.20. The other grades have not changed. Guangdong Sugar Company offered 100 bags of "Diao Qing" sugar at $11.10. Guangdong and Hong Kong dealers were asking $14 for Hainan red sugar, but no sales were made.</p>

<h3>Several Harms of Excessive Indulgence, and Their Medical Remedies</h3>
<p>— Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Department of a Russian Labor University</p>
<p>Animals have the instinct to reproduce to prolong the species. Sexual desire is a manifestation of this instinct. However, if this sexual desire is excessively indulged, it will greatly harm various parts of the body, especially shortening human life, which has been consistently verified by doctors in various countries.</p>
<p>Therefore, to prevent premature aging and prolong life, in addition to paying attention to daily diet and habits, one should regulate one's sexual life. Modern medicine has advanced greatly. It has been proven that the harm to brainpower, the weakening of sexual function, and the obstacles to fertility caused by excessive indulgence are becoming increasingly clear and verifiable.</p>
<p>Engaging in sexual behavior before the body and mind are fully developed can also be regarded as excessive indulgence. Furthermore, if the body is inherently weak and lacking, even engaging in sexual intercourse only once or twice a month causes extreme fatigue, then these one or two instances of sexual behavior may also be considered excessive. All activities that weaken the body's health should be avoided by those seeking offspring.</p>
<p>According to the most advanced medical judgment of modern times, long-term abstinence is also not a good way to maintain health. Therefore, a person's sexual behavior must be determined based on his or her health condition. For young people aged sixteen or seventeen, every drop of semen is material needed to lay the foundation for future health. At this time, if one commits self-abuse or becomes dissolute, the result will be great damage to the body. Headaches, head heaviness, tinnitus, palpitations, forgetfulness, insomnia, and various other symptoms of premature aging and kidney deficiency will appear. Therefore, young people under the age of twenty should remain celibate, regardless of how favorable the environment may be. However, if one frequently engages in self-abuse, then a different approach is needed.</p>
<p>In addition to the above symptoms, excessive indulgence can also cause a sudden decline in sexual ability. Premature ejaculation, kidney deficiency, and infertility may follow. The best treatment is to take the German "Bit Maru" essence preparation for men, "Bu Ti Kang." This agent is composed entirely of extracts from calf, deer, orangutan, seal, goat testicles using scientific methods to extract their essence. Imagine using the essence of robust animals to supplement the deficiency of human body essence. It will naturally exert its great therapeutic effect. I have clinically confirmed that it has the functions of tonifying the brain, blood, and kidneys. The female version is a good medicine for regulating menstruation and promoting fertility.</p>

<h3>New Principles for the Radical Cure of Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is not truly incurable. The reason why it is difficult to cure is that it becomes a chronic condition due to delayed or incorrect treatment. The best approach is to seek correct medical treatment as early as possible to achieve a cure. However, if the disease is prolonged, the virus will penetrate deeper. How can one expect a radical cure in a short period? However, this statement only refers to the difficulty of achieving a radical cure of chronic gonorrhea in the shortest time. It does not mean that it cannot be cured. Because once gonorrhea becomes chronic, the toxins are no longer concentrated in the urethra but are scattered throughout various parts of the body. Therefore, treatment takes longer than treating acute gonorrhea. Patients should be calm and trust the doctor's treatment.</p>
<p>However, I often see gonorrhea patients who, because their illness cannot be cured immediately, inevitably show anxiety. The general medicines on the market cater to this desire, claiming that their medicines can definitely eradicate the disease in a short time. Gonorrhea patients, regardless of their methods, compete to take these medicines. As a result, they often fail to achieve the desired results and are disappointed. Or their condition may be even worse than before they were ill. This is because they do not know the truth about gonorrhea and make such mistakes. Because there is no such thing in the world as a gonorrhea medicine that can cure the disease in one or two days as in mythology.</p>
<p>In my experience, the medicine that best meets my ideal is "Ke Lin Nong," invented by Dr. Peter of Germany. This medicine is based on non-specific therapy and is made from a mixture of protein and pigment. It has been gradually improved through thousands of field tests and tests in famous venereal disease hospitals in various countries, until it has reached a state of perfection. It is completely different from the crudely manufactured medicines on the market. All cases of new and old leukorrhea that have not been cured by various city doctors' surgeries, injections, and various over-the-counter medicines can be completely cured by taking "Ke Lin Nong" within three to five weeks. In addition, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" can be used externally! For female gonorrhea leukorrhea, "Ka Er Xue Di Vaginal Tablets" can be used as suppositories, which are especially effective.</p>
<h3>The Latest Good Medicine for Curing Lung Diseases</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Although doctors in various countries have made inventions for the treatment of lung diseases, the power of tuberculosis has continued to increase. There are few medicines with special effects. The commonly used medicines can also be effective for a while, but they are not absolutely effective. Therefore, both doctors and patients suffer. However, medicines composed of iodine and calcareous matter have the effect of improving physical fitness and the mechanism of treatment, and have a strong bactericidal power. The medicine "Bu Fei Na Er" was invented based on the above principle. This product is truly effective for lung diseases. All symptoms such as hemoptysis, sputum, coughing, dyspnea, chest pain, bloody sputum, loss of appetite, night sweats, pale face, and emaciation can be miraculously cured by taking it. Because it can fill calcareous matter and heal the cavities in the lungs, it has remarkable effects on all stages of lung disease.</p>
<h3>Do Young Men Who Masturbate and Have Nocturnal Emissions Have the Qualifications to Be Husbands in the Future?</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Doctor of Medicine</p>
<p>There are so many young men who masturbate and have nocturnal emissions. Although we in the medical community constantly advise them, only a few can truly break away from their evil ways and reform. In every corner of society, there are still many young men engaging in their sexual sins to satisfy their desires. Over time, not only will their entire will be exhausted, but marriage will also become a serious problem.</p>
<p>Because masturbation can quickly destroy sexual function and lead to a state of hypersensitivity, people who masturbate will inevitably experience premature ejaculation after marriage. Especially young men during puberty, often suffer from nocturnal emissions due to masturbation. Constant leakage of essence and blood will hinder and stop their development, leading to impotence and kidney deficiency. Young men with premature ejaculation, impotence, and kidney deficiency are hated by every woman because they cannot have a happy sexual life and bear the responsibility of giving birth to children. Therefore, such people are not qualified to be husbands. However, in medicine, the newest way to restore the health of such people is to take the testicular essence preparation "Bu Ti Kang." Those who have nocturnal emissions should take "Nai Er Si Nocturnal Emission Tablets" to be effective. Therefore, those who suffer from this kind of problem should wake up as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Leukorrhea Easily Leads to Sexual Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Narrated by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: Intersection of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road, No. 9</p>
<p>……Sexual nerves are extremely fragile and sensitive, so they are easily weakened.</p>
<p>……Therefore, it is best to cure it before the gonococci enter the deep internal reproductive organs such as the testicles.</p>
<p>The reason why gonorrhea easily destroys sexual function is that gonococci often cluster in the reproductive organs. This is because gonococci have the ability to escape, and the external reproductive organs and internal reproductive organs have the urethra as a channel of communication. The most obvious example is that they invade the prostate and testicles through the posterior urethra, causing prostatitis and orchitis. Of course, once these diseases occur, they are extremely likely to damage the patient's sexual nerves. Therefore, we must be extremely careful in treating gonorrhea. If we are careless, we may cause the prostate and testicles to collapse. Therefore, once we know that a gonorrhea patient has prostatitis, we must quickly find a way to cure it. If we delay for a moment or misdiagnose it, gonococci will often invade the inside, and there is a risk of complications of orchitis.</p>
<p>How can we avoid these dangers? If we can ask a doctor with experience and responsibility to treat us, we can avoid these adverse outcomes. Before orchitis occurs, we can use agile massage and German static electricity therapy, and the holy medicine "Ke Lin Nong" for gonorrhea, to quickly save the situation and eliminate gonococci. Then, the symptoms of prostatitis can be completely cured, and the symptoms of gonococcal neurasthenia (such as prostatic leakage, nocturnal emission, and premature ejaculation) can also be cured, and the original healthy performance can be restored. Do not delay and make mistakes, lest you cause disharmony in your future marital love and regret it. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. From today, 20 free consultation tickets will be given out every day. Each ticket will cost only five jiao and will include a complimentary copy of my book "Complete Book of Venereal Diseases" worth one yuan.</p>

<h3>Where Do Young People's Old Hobbies Come From?</h3>
<p>— Xiaoren</p>
<p>A few years ago, someone copied the words of old writers from the "May Fourth Movement" era to guide young people. These words were: "To make new literature good, old literature must have a foundation!" During the May Fourth Movement, this was a brilliant plan by old writers. At that time, because new literature had won, old writers felt the danger and came up with this sentence to both hold on to old literature and send a "flirtatious glance" to famous new writers. But now, some people are also saying this, but they are "genuine" new writers. The effect is like some young writers are writing better than them, and they can't stand it, so they bring out old literature to intimidate them. The meaning is: "Don't be smug, that kind of writing will never work!" Naturally, this does stabilize their position to a certain extent, but it really doesn't benefit young people. In the past, old writers used this sentence to lure a group of new people to climb up, become sages, talk nonsense about national affairs, and open several so-called national studies book catalogs. But this time, it can only make young people feel dejected and dare not write anymore. This is called "each generation is inferior to the previous one." In the end, apart from causing young people to develop old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, it doesn't leave anything behind.</p>
<p>And at the same time, came square poetry. That was super new, and the authors were mostly people who understood foreign languages and even declared that they were imitating some foreign style. But readers were very strange and couldn't appreciate that kind of art. They had to fall asleep to read it. This secretly responded to the old writers' prediction: "Chinese literature is fundamentally different from foreign literature. Imitating foreign literature will make it unrecognizable!" And the facts were indeed correct. The poems were written in squares and had no poetic flavor! Then, it's better to have five-character or seven-character poems, which are much more straightforward. So, some new writers came out and slapped themselves, saying that it was still questionable whether new poetry could stand on its own. As a result, old poetry really raised its head. You wrote one, I wrote one, and everyone rolled up their sleeves and started writing. In the end, apart from causing young people to develop old hobbies that even they themselves didn't understand, it didn't leave anything behind.</p>
<p>I don't know how it happened, but suddenly there was a quarrel between the "Beijing School" and the "Shanghai School." The conclusion of the quarrel was: "The Beijing School is good, the Shanghai School is not." So, the "Shanghai School" bravely rose up and followed the "Beijing School." From then on, a big trend was created. "Spirituality literature, real literature, and record literature are the advanced literary styles." The ancestor of "spirituality" was originally a prose style of the Ming Dynasty, but soon it expanded to the so-called "rare books." Naturally, this was good, but some "books" were really not "rare." Later, even Ye Shaoyuan's semi-true and semi-false poetry collection for his wife became a treasure that young people had to read. "Record literature" is not like the rambling of colloquial literature, which is of course also good because it can save paper. But the paper saved was used to print classical Chinese and old poems, and the strangest thing was that the masters of the "spirituality" school also brought out "A Rustic's Exposure." This trend really made people dizzy. In the end, needless to say, apart from causing young people to develop old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, it didn't leave anything behind.</p>
<p>On the teacher side, the movement was first initiated by the "Beijing School" elders. If a student wrote a wrong word on the exam, the examiner would pick up the pen and ridicule him greatly, and the method of ridicule was also to write old poems, oil-slang old poems. This made the younger generation of the "Shanghai School" envious, so they advocated that young people specialize in vocabulary in ancient books. Whether young people specialized in it or not, no one seems to have investigated, but judging from the tone of the advocates, if they didn't specialize, they would be deducted points. And in fact, it's really no wonder, many Chinese language test questions in universities are taken from ancient books, either the "Book of Changes" or "Rhetoric", as if the older the more suitable. In fact, the people who put out those questions may not be able to know them all without looking up the books. If they were to take the exam as students, they might even hand in a blank paper. But in short, the result is needless to say, the more so, it is besides causing young people to develop old hobbies that even they themselves don't understand, it didn't leave anything behind.</p>
<p>These are all the achievements of our celebrities. Counting them, naturally, there aren't many, but just these few are already enough to pull some young people back on the wrong track. I agree with Mr. Shang Qing's suggestion a few days ago that all teachers should seriously give young people some good guidance. But is it really possible to do it in practice?</p>

<p>I looked straight ahead and saw only two legs moving closer, so I bent down and dug; suddenly there was a clap and they turned away again, the sound of footsteps gradually faded from my ears, and I took a breath again, and pushed all the mud back, making the pile on the ground even higher.</p>
<p>I thought, if that guy came from behind and kicked me a few times, sweeping all the mud down, I would be buried here.</p>
<p>The sweat on my forehead was dripping: Was I really digging my own grave? Was this my tomb? Alas, the more I thought about it, the more I felt cold... so I hurriedly turned around, stood on tiptoes and looked around, and then hurriedly cut out a few steps of mud steps on the pit wall.</p>
<p>After a while, I did hear a faint sound of footsteps in my ears, so I squeezed the shovel, stepped on the pit wall with my right foot, turned backwards, and then stood still.</p>
<p>I immediately stepped up one step, my heart was jumping and jumping non-stop, but I saw that guy holding a rifle and aiming at a runner in front.</p>
<p>"Bang--" The gunshot pierced the sky, and I hurriedly shrank down, waited for a while, and then used the shovel to prop myself up to take a look, the two legs in front were shaking and shaking and retreating, the guy's knees bent left and right, and then he stood still.</p>
<p>"Bang--" I thought the person running was finished, so I lay on the side of the pit and listened quietly, the sound of leather boots rubbing the ground was very clear, I stood on tiptoes again, the two trembling legs were only five or six feet away from my head. Suddenly, I unconsciously mustered my strength and suddenly climbed out of the pit wall with the shovel, lay on the ground and rolled over; but that guy immediately turned his head very keenly and stabbed down with the rifle like a mad dog at me.</p>
<p>"Bang--" My eyes went dark, and I mustered my strength to stand up against the gunshot, and took advantage of the momentum to hit him squarely on the shoulder with the shovel, and he fell down stiffly.</p>
<p>I wiped the sweat on my forehead and smiled proudly at this horizontal yellow candle. I looked into the distance again, and that person was walking towards this side.</p>
<p>"Haha, is that you, Egret No. 8?" I saw clearly that it was him, so I shouted, "I saved your life!"</p>
<p>He walked closer slowly, holding a Mauser in his hand, and said calmly, "I've been watching you dig a grave over there for a long time, now bury him." I went over to take a closer look, but the ground was full of blood, and I looked at how deep the wound on his shoulder was - this was my masterpiece, such a powerful chop.</p>
<p>But that guy's shoulder wasn't even broken, and the blood was gurgling from his back.</p>
<p>I understood, and greeted Egret No. 8 shamefully:</p>
<p>"I've been digging a grave for this grandson for a long time, I'm really exhausted: Thank you, can you help me carry him into that pit?"</p>
<h3>Bēn Quán (Rushing Spring)</h3>
<p>— Dīng Dì (Ding Di)</p>
<p>"Glorious spring! May my heart be like your new flock, enduring, upward, and ever-renewing." ——HewoI</p>
<p>Rushing spring, I love its powerful surging.</p>
<p>Not the moldy, stagnant water in the dark pool, not the ever-still waves confined to a narrow river, not as soft, frivolous, and weak as lake water, nor as flat, merely spreading to both banks: it surges upward, with streams of force, constantly expanding upward, the air unable to suppress it, galloping, twisting like a swimming dragon. The long days and months drag a gray, hazy shadow, and in that haze, the spring's sound plays an unceasing song of joy. In the haze, there are glittering golden scales.</p>
<p>There is no stopping, the water will never run dry, in mountain streams, in valleys, amidst the scattered, withered vines and chaotic leaves, go search, there you will always find a pool of emerald green ripples, in the deep, secluded depths of small cliffs, hanging down a strip of silvery light, shimmering in the sun, also mixed with mountain red flowers, small grass and leaves, rushing and roaring, showing the great joy of nature, the high song of vibrant life.</p>
<p>Exploring the endlessness of the spring source, what you feel is not disappointment, not vagueness, you will therefore further expand the realm of life.</p>
<p>For example, let's say life is a rushing stream. Life should have a core, just like, when we eat apples, pears, or walnuts, don't they all have an annoying core? Exploring this core is no different from peeling a fruit at will or cracking the hard shell of a dried fruit. Pursue the truth of life, just like, exploring the ultimate source of the spring.</p>
<p>But is there no truth forever? I know it has a core. "Pursue that truth."</p>
<p>I say, "I love that spring source."</p>
<p>I remember the scenes I saw two years ago.</p>
<p>It was outside the mountain gate of Hupao Spring. New green tinged the mountain slopes. A burst of fragrance floated up, mountain mist struck my brow, my brow was pale. In the cracks of the rocks, leaning against the earthen cliffs, a row of trees on the cliffs, somewhat irregular, yet seemingly chaotic. The shade of the trees covered the spring water, the gurgling whispers, a continuous sound, penetrated the shadows. Like a rope tied to the ear, the sound of the spring followed me as I walked, walking up the stone steps…</p>
<p>Also in Hangzhou, in the dim and heavy Phoebe zhennan forest, going to Jiuxi Shiba Jian (Nine Creeks and Eighteen Gullies), turning a few bends on the road, I entered a suddenly open realm. Bubbling with latent force, flowing through the narrow cliffs, a few spirals, impacting the mountain rocks, splashing open grains of water droplets. Looking back, I gradually walked away, looking at the white stone, I thought, when did it start flowing? I calculated it for it.</p>
<p>In the cold weather, it keeps moving, surging upward, flowing downward. Now I'm calculating it for it, it's still flowing. Flowing into winding streams, from the valley: hidden among withered branches and chaotic leaves, carrying a fallen red small boat, and flowing again into the unknowable. Maybe returning to the valley?</p>
<p>When leaving Hangzhou, I calculated for myself, it's been exactly two years. The old spring water, I don't know where it has flowed, even a small homemade fountain in my goldfish bowl has long been destroyed without a trace. Am I disappointed? No, I know the spring is still flowing, flowing every second, tirelessly, without rest.</p>
<p>If you block it with stones, maybe you see the unfortunate temporary stopping of the spring, but when the power of this spring breaks through the obstacle, you know it is more powerful than before. Grasping the long-term life, the spring never dies.</p>
<p>No one has ever subdued the spring, we know that many stones have rotted.</p>
<h3>Xīng Huǒ (Spark)</h3>
<p>— Shǔguāng (Dawn)</p>
<p>In the hazy future,</p>
<p>A spark flashed out,</p>
<p>Bright!</p>
<p>Eyes, deeply buried in the dark earthen tomb,</p>
<p>Spent nineteen years of suffering,</p>
<p>Only now touched the torch of freedom.</p>
<p>Left hand propping up in the mud,</p>
<p>Right hand holding onto the mountain rocks beside me,</p>
<p>Stepping in one foot,</p>
<p>Then closely following the next step.</p>
<p>Who is it, that scattered this slippery layer,</p>
<p>Making me falter, unable to open my pace?</p>
<p>Looking back is a stretch of black with dancing ghosts,</p>
<p>Only ahead rises a spark.</p>
<p>Go!</p>

<h3>Jiùjīnshān Huáqiáo Qíngxíng (Situation of Overseas Chinese in San Francisco)</h3>
<p>In the port of San Francisco, there are approximately over one hundred thousand Chinese people, all independently operating, seeking food to make a living; the wages vary, the lower end being more than twenty gold per month, and the higher end approaching one hundred gold. Those manufacturing leather shoes, although engaged in a small business, are uniquely profitable. However, the locals are jealous and resentful of the Chinese, which has happened more than once, because they are seizing their lucrative businesses. They are constantly thinking of taking up arms against them, and these people are all from Willis, England, who are impoverished and unable to make a living. Since the opening of the port of San Francisco, they have been cultivating the land here, raising children and grandchildren. Once the Chinese take over their businesses, they hold a grudge and are determined to kill them to vent their anger. As for the Americans, they treat the Chinese quite well, and local officials protect them from time to time. However, the locals are numerous and powerful, while the Americans are few and insufficient to suppress them. Recently, a wheeled railway has been built from the main port of San Francisco to New York, making travel convenient. If there is an emergency and troops are dispatched, they can arrive in seven days, so there is no need to worry about the locals engaging in rampant cruelty.</p>
<h3>Hǎijūn Shǐ Yāntái (Navy Sails to Yantai)</h3>
<p>The nation has already ordered Guangdong to dispatch sixteen old-style warships and six steam-powered warships, all of which will sail to Yantai between summer and autumn, awaiting deployment. From current speculation, it is suspected that this is related to the situation in Taiwan, and that there will be military action. Therefore, large ships are being gathered to transport soldiers.</p>
<h3>Fǔjūn Jiàoyú Téngkōng (The Governor's Sedan Chair Soars into the Air)</h3>
<p>Governor Zhang of Wuzhong was about to visit a guest, and the sedan umbrella and flags were all waiting. Suddenly, a military officer came to pay his respects, and the Governor had no choice but to meet with him. Before the guest left, the Governor's sedan chair soared into the air. Only a sudden whooshing sound was heard, and smoke and flames filled the sky. The green felt sedan chair turned into a red fireball, as it was a gunpowder explosion. In shock, the Governor summoned all the officials and interrogated them, learning that it was done by a dismissed patrol officer. The arrival of the military officer, neither too early nor too late, saved the Governor from the fire disaster, which was quite a coincidence.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Chéngzhì Tānwū zhī Lìfǎ Yángé (Legislative Evolution of Punishing Corruption)</h3>
<p>— Jìng (Quiet)</p>
<p>The National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Corruption on June 27 of last year, consisting of eleven articles in full, effective from the date of promulgation.</p>
<p>Criminal officials, the chapter on dereliction of duty in the criminal law, originally had very detailed provisions. However, at this time, the nation is in a critical autumn of survival, soldiers, civil servants, and those handling public welfare affairs, at this dangerous juncture, should be careful and self-disciplined, and devote themselves to diligent governance. What heart and soul do they have to harbor thoughts of corruption, being traitors to the nation above and villains to the people below? This is why the government, in addition to the chapter on dereliction of duty in the criminal law, has specially promulgated special criminal laws, also in the spirit of "using heavy penalties to govern a chaotic country."</p>
<p>Criminal officials have been heavily punished in all dynasties' criminal laws. Before the Qin and Han dynasties, regardless, Li Kui's Legal Canon listed accepting bribes and perverting the law as the first chapter on theft of law, because although bribery is not theft, its greedy heart is no different from theft, the evil of which can be imagined. In the Xiao Code's section on official duties, those in charge who accepted bribes and perverted the law were given one hundred strokes of the cane; one bolt of silk added one degree; fifteen bolts of silk, strangulation. Those who did not pervert the law were given ninety strokes of the cane for one chi (unit of length); two bolts of silk added one degree; thirty bolts of silk, exile. Those without salary were reduced one degree each. Those who perverted the law, twenty bolts of silk, strangulation. Those who did not pervert the law, forty bolts of silk, exile. The punishment in the Ming Code was even more severe, with a special section on accepting bribes, stipulating that those with salary who perverted the law and accepted bribes, seventeen strokes of the cane for one guan (unit of currency) or less; increasing sequentially, adding exile for twenty guan or more; those accepting bribes in four instances of legal infractions, seventeen strokes of the cane for one guan or less; increasing sequentially, adding exile for twenty guan or more; over forty-five guan, exile; up to eighty guan, strangulation; those who did not pervert the law and accepted bribes, sixty strokes of the cane for one guan or less; over fifty guan, penal servitude; over one hundred guan, exile. Unsalaried individuals who perverted the law and accepted bribes, one hundred and twenty guan, strangulation. Unsalaried individuals who did not pervert the law and accepted bribes over one hundred and twenty guan, the crime was limited to one hundred strokes of the cane and exile of three thousand li. This continued until the Qing Dynasty, without being mitigated, that is, in the current criminal law of the late Qing Dynasty, accepting bribes, officials accepting money, also stipulated that salaried officials accepting one tael or more would be punished in seven degrees, increasing sequentially, penal servitude for over twenty taels, exile for forty-five taels; strangulation for eighty taels. Those who did not pervert the law and accepted bribes, six degrees of crime for one tael or more; penal servitude for over fifty taels, exile for over one hundred taels; strangulation for over one hundred and twenty taels. Unsalaried individuals who perverted the law and accepted bribes, one hundred and twenty taels, strangulation; Unsalaried individuals who did not pervert the law and accepted bribes over one hundred and twenty taels, the crime was limited to exile of three thousand li. Since the Republic of China, since the Provisional New Criminal Law, there have been special chapters on dereliction of duty; however, in the third year of the Republic, the Law for Punishing Officials and Clerks Who Commit Bribery was promulgated, although the provisions were few, the punishment was especially severe. A certain Wang, the magistrate of the capital, was sentenced to death under item two of that regulation for receiving bribes and engaging in conduct that violated his duties, marking the beginning of applying special laws to bribery cases. This law was repealed by decree in July of the fifth year of the Republic. In March of the tenth year of the Republic, the Regulations for Punishing Officials and Clerks Who Commit Bribery were promulgated again, with a fixed implementation period of three years. The term was not extended upon expiration. After the establishment of the National Government, orders and injunctions were repeatedly issued regarding honesty and prohibiting official misconduct. In September of the fifteenth year of the Republic, the Regulations for Punishing Party Members Who Break Oaths were promulgated, stipulating that party members who used their authority to manipulate finances for personal gain or the benefit of others, or who embezzled treasury funds, with an amount exceeding one thousand yuan, would be sentenced to death and their property confiscated. In the seventeenth year of the Republic, the Supreme Court, in Interpretation No. 211 of the Explanation, expanded its scope of application, allowing all officials who committed bribery to be punished under that regulation. There was even advocacy for the establishment of a special court for punishing corruption, which was widely supported. Although it did not materialize, the movement to punish corruption was vigorously pursued for a time. On February 17 of the twentieth year, the Regulations for Punishing Party Members Who Break Oaths were repealed, and thereafter, ordinary criminal law was applied to bribery cases. According to the chapter on dereliction of duty in the criminal law implemented in September of the seventeenth year, the punishment for perverting the law and bribery was imprisonment for life or imprisonment for more than five years but less than an indefinite term, and a fine of up to 10,000 yuan may be imposed concurrently, further inheriting the intention of the old law to "calculate the value of the bribe to determine the crime," allowing for an increase in punishment within the scope of the benefits obtained. (Article 58 of the Criminal Law) Looking at the legislative system for punishing corruption throughout history, although not entirely the same, the spirit is consistent and has not changed.</p>
<p>Now is a time of great crisis, and the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Corruption have been promulgated again. From a historical perspective, this is not surprising. However, after exploring its content, there are things worthy of praise:</p>
<p>1.  Implementation Period: Generally speaking, the implementation period of temporary special laws and regulations is mostly limited, with little room for flexibility. The Provisional Regulations for Punishing Corruption, however, take the duration of the war as its implementation period. In other words, the period of war is the period of implementation of these regulations. The regulations will not expire as long as the war continues. This is because cleaning up corrupt officials is an essential part of completing the great cause of national construction, and cultivating integrity is a crucial task in rectifying officialdom. The objects of crime stipulated in these regulations are mostly related to the nature of wartime, such as military salaries, military engineering, military supplies, military vehicles, aircraft, horses, pack animals, etc. Therefore, taking the duration of the war as its implementation period is to facilitate the application of the law and to adapt to the needs of the environment.</p>
<p>2.  Scope of Subject: The subject of ordinary criminal law's dereliction of duty crimes is, in principle, limited to civil servants, excluding soldiers and those who handle public welfare affairs. The same is true for special laws throughout history. For example, the Law for Punishing Officials and Clerks Who Commit Bribery limits its actors to officials and clerks; the Regulations for Punishing Party Members Who Break Oaths limit its actors to party members and non-party members who hold official positions. The subject of crime in these regulations includes soldiers, civil servants, and those who handle public welfare affairs, which is a unique feature in the legislative history of punishing corruption.</p>
<p>3.  Highest System: The penalty for corruption has always been severe. In the chapter on dereliction of duty in the Provisional New Criminal Law, the highest degree of punishment for corruption was first-degree imprisonment; in the chapter on dereliction of duty in the old criminal law, the highest degree of punishment for corruption was imprisonment for more than three years but less than seven years; in the chapter on dereliction of duty in the current criminal law, the highest degree of punishment for corruption is imprisonment for life. Although the severity varies, the crime is limited to imprisonment, not death. In special laws, such as Article 2, Item 2 of the Law for Punishing Officials and Clerks Who Commit Bribery, and Articles 3 and 4 of the Regulations for Punishing Party Members Who Break Oaths, although the most severe penalty is death, the former's implementation period has long expired, and the latter has been expressly repealed for seven years, making the punishment of corruption gradually more lenient, which cannot be denied. During this period of war, if corruption recurs, the impact will be particularly detrimental. Therefore, these regulations make the death penalty the most severe penalty.</p>
<p>4.  Types of Crimes: According to the chapter on dereliction of duty in the criminal law, except for Article 129, Paragraph 3, which has special provisions for punishing the attempted crime of public officials illegally collecting taxes and levies and suppressing or withholding the issuance of funds or items; the remaining crimes of dereliction of duty have no clear provisions for punishing attempted crimes. As for the punishment of conspiracy to commit crimes, special provisions are only provided for the crimes of internal rebellion and foreign aggression. The punishment for preparing to commit crimes is only provided for the crimes of internal rebellion, foreign aggression, public danger, murder, robbery, extortion, etc. Conspiracy or preparation for crimes of dereliction of duty are not punishable. It seems too lenient in peacetime, but during wartime, the scope of punishing corruption must be expanded. The three types of criminal conduct: conspiracy, preparation, and failure to complete, one belongs to the internal intent of the crime, the second belongs to the act of preparing for the crime, and the third belongs to the failure to complete the execution of the crime. Although the degree of crime has not been completed, in terms of corruption crimes during wartime, it is sufficient to recognize the serious evil of the criminal. These regulations specially set up special articles and punished them together, deeply understanding the meaning of punishing evil.</p>
<p>5.  Confiscation of Property: The provisions on confiscation in these regulations are extremely complete in legislative system. In addition to those who have committed crimes under these regulations, the illicit money and property obtained, if publicly owned, should be recovered. If it is not publicly owned, it should be confiscated or returned to the victims according to the circumstances. If all or part of the illicit money and property cannot be recovered or confiscated, its value should be recovered. If the recovered amount cannot be paid, the property may be confiscated as a way to execute the recovery. If the value of the property is less than the amount to be recovered, necessary living expenses for the family may be left, meaning that the guilt does not extend to the wife and children. There is also a saying that, according to the interpretation of the former Supreme Court and the Judicial Yuan, the confiscated items are limited to movable property. (Refer to Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 574 and Unified Character No. 1148). However, according to an expanded interpretation of Article 38 of the Criminal Law, immovable property is also not impossible to confiscate. These regulations list both "illicit money" and "illicit property," the former specifically referring to movable property, and the latter including immovable property. Therefore, the property confiscated in accordance with these regulations should also be interpreted broadly.</p>
<p>6.  Jurisdictional Organ: These regulations take the duration of the war as the implementation period, and the subject of the crime includes soldiers. The objects of protection are mostly of a wartime nature, as mentioned above. Therefore, its jurisdiction should belong to military organs. Therefore, those who commit crimes under these regulations, whether soldiers, civil servants, or those who handle public welfare affairs, are all tried and executed by military organs. As for the designation of jurisdiction, it is also done by military organs.</p>
<p>The evolution and characteristics of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Corruption are as described above. However, how perfect the legislation is and how smooth the implementation is are not what we want to hear. It is only when there is no litigation that we can achieve no punishment. We hope that the entire nation will have a deep understanding of the implementation of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Corruption and encourage each other, "The failure of the nation is due to the evil of officials." Let us encourage each other!</p>
<p>Judicial Compilation</p>
<p>(Excerpts from the Shanghai Special Zone Branch of the Supreme Court)</p>
<p>Using a check to pay off old debts for goods, if the check is not cashed, it constitutes a new debt of non-performance of the negotiable instrument. According to Article 320 of the Civil Code, the old debt is not extinguished. (Hushangzi No. 24 of the 28th year of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>Identifying facts, selecting and adopting evidence belongs to the duties of the fact-finding court. If its identification of facts and adoption of evidence is not contrary to the law, the parties are not allowed to arbitrarily accuse it of being inappropriate. (Hushangzi No. 26 of the 28th year of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>Legal Questions</p>
<p>(Question) When an insurer goes bankrupt, except as otherwise provided in Article 79, insurance contracts are terminated one month after the declaration of bankruptcy, as specified in the first half of Article 28 of the Insurance Law. Why is the termination period of life insurance contracts different from other insurance contracts? If the insurer has declared bankruptcy, it is clear that its assets are insufficient to pay off its debts. If the contract is still valid within one month after its bankruptcy, and a risk occurs at this time, the insurer is unable to compensate, and even if the insurance amount it should receive is delivered to the creditors for equal distribution, the amount obtained is also limited. It is not the way to protect the insured or the beneficiary. What is the legislative reason? Please explain it once to enlighten my ignorance! (Xiàng Jiǒng)</p>
<p>(Answer) When an insurer goes bankrupt, there is indeed a question worth studying as to why the termination period of casualty insurance contracts and life insurance contracts is different. When I was drafting the amended Insurance Law, I also paid attention to this and thought about amending it. Because this clause was adopted from French law, I thought there must be a special reason, so I did not dare to move it without authorization. However, during the first reading at the Legislative Yuan, I explained the reasons for wanting to amend it to the public, hoping to modify it in the review committee. In the end, due to various reasons, the original text was maintained and not changed. This is the original reason for amending Articles 28 and 79 of the Insurance Law, and its legislative reason really needs to be studied.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, life insurance contracts are often established for a longer period, and the calculation of insurance premiums depends on the size of the age. Once the contract is established, the insurance premium that the insured should pay each year is fixed and will not change. Therefore, the annual insurance premium for a life insurance contract established at the age of forty is lower than the life insurance premium established at the age of forty-one. Therefore, if a life insurance contract is terminated for any reason after it is established, and then a contract is established with another insurer, the conditions of the contract cannot be the same as the previous contract. Even if it is for the protection of the policyholder, stipulating that the termination period of his contract will be extended by one month when the insurer goes bankrupt, the same as for the loss insurance contract, it will still not allow the policyholder to establish a life insurance contract with the same conditions with another insurer, and it will still be of no help. It is better to terminate it when the insurer goes bankrupt. As for the loss insurance contract, the period is usually one year. For the protection of the insured, the legislator stipulates a one-month delay in termination, so that the policyholder can re-establish an insurance contract with the same conditions with other insurers, so as not to suffer losses in the short period of time after the immediate termination. This may also be the main reason for the legislation of the two articles, because the insurer's debts are not only one type of compensation liability, but there are other arrears such as property mortgages, etc. The law stipulates that the termination period of the loss insurance contract should be delayed by one month, which is also to protect the interests of the insured.

<p>(Question) A rents a part of his surplus house to B. Last year, when A intended to take it back for his own use due to an increase in population, B requested mediation from the Residential Problems Mediation Committee. As a result, B agreed to vacate the house by the end of April of this year. Both parties wrote mediation documents and held them as evidence. A sent a letter at the end of March to inform B of his performance, but B is still overdue and refuses to vacate. (1) Can Party A immediately request the court to execute it? (2) If it is necessary to first file a lawsuit for judgment, can a request be made to allow provisional execution? (3) Is it necessary to provide a guarantee when requesting provisional execution? (4) Can A request B to compensate for the losses caused by the delay (according to which articles of the Civil Code)? (Yáng Xiāngbō) (1) No. (2) Yes. (3) According to the law, the court should declare provisional execution ex officio, without the need for a guarantee. (4) Yes. (According to Article 231 of the Civil Code) (Ditto)</p>
<p>(Question) (1) A and B are both women, each with a husband, and although the two hosts are friendly, there is no improper relationship. If B's husband finds out, is A committing a crime? (2) Is A committing a crime if he gives something to B? (3) If A and B want to live together, what are the procedures? (4) If B commits suicide due to unrequited love, what crime does A commit? (5) B marries her husband without a certificate. If her husband later finds out about B's love affair with A, does he have the right to not care? (Chén Qí)</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) Since A and B did not have illicit intercourse, they should not be guilty. (2) Giving gifts is not a criminal act. (3) A is already married? B is also already married. If they live together, they will violate the crime in Article 239 of the Criminal Law. (4) If A has incited or assisted suicide, he should be held liable for the crime in Article 275 of the Criminal Law. (5) A marriage certificate is not a necessary form for marriage. If B and her husband have indeed married, then the husband is not without the right to care about her relationship while the left marital relationship continues. (Huáng)</p>
<p>(Question) After B's death, his younger brother C seduced B's wife A and gave birth to a son D. Because C has a wife, he abandoned A and D, mother and son. (1) Can A and C freely break away from the relationship? (2) Is it legal for D to be raised by A? (3) What procedures and results are there when D comes of age? (Yóu Gùshì)</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) Yes. (2) Legal. (3) None. (Wú Guāngdǐng)</p>
<p>(Answer) (Mǎi Xiānshēng) The question has been assigned to the "Legal Questions" column of the second issue of this publication on the eighth of this month (May). (Yi)</p>
<p>Brief Comments</p>
<h3>Fùzhài Zǐ Huán (Father's Debts Repaid by Son)</h3>
<p>— (Wúyòng) (Useless)</p>
<p>"Father's debts repaid by son" has been generally recognized by society for thousands of years. However, the accompanying laws, fearing that the violence would lead to self-abandonment and the lack of talent, have provisions for "limited inheritance" and "abandonment of inheritance rights." Those who abandon the inheritance do not care about the parents' assets and liabilities, and those who limit the inheritance are not responsible for the parents' debts when the parents' estate is not enough to pay off the debts.</p>

<p>Cigarette cards are popular among the general lower-class laborers and children with limited knowledge, so they bear the responsibility of educating the public. Their influence is significant, especially in this great era when the motherland and the nation are facing life and death, and we are in such adversity...</p>
<p>Recently, there is a cigarette called "Great Anchor Brand" on the market. Its cigarette cards depict miserable scenes of refugee areas, and the back is printed with "Refugee Song." Refugee Song (4) goes like this:</p>
<p>——Arriving in a bustling city,</p>
<p>Hoping to find a place to rely on;</p>
<p>Who knew that the land is inhospitable, and poverty is hard to cure,</p>
<p>Begging on the streets,</p>
<p>Suffering from cold and lack of clothing,</p>
<p>Where is home after the country is lost?</p>
<p>Such material is taken from the bloody reality and the familiar environment around us. Moreover, the form of the text is in the "song" style, which is easy to understand. Some are the "living spoken language" of the public, so they are closer to the public and suitable for the public's taste. It is very meaningful and worth promoting and emulating.</p>
<p>But we are by no means saying that the material for cigarette cards must be taken from the reality of this era and environment. Historical stories (such as the Biography of Yue Fei and Mulan Joining the Army, which are rich in national consciousness and educational significance) are equally valuable.</p>
<p>In short, we sincerely hope that domestic cigarette companies can more practically shoulder this responsibility—the responsibility of educating the public. This is an easy and simple task, but its impact and significance are so great!</p>
<h3>Tapping Little Hammers</h3>
<p>— Zhu Yan</p>
<p>—A Typist's Life Record—</p>
<p>The first important thing to do when arriving at the office in the morning is to carefully uncover the cover on the typewriter. Every time I stroke the typewriter, my means of livelihood for the past ten years, I can't help but feel sad.</p>
<p>Every morning from nine o'clock to twelve o'clock, and in the afternoon from one o'clock to five o'clock, my ten fingers "tap, tap" on the typewriter without stopping. Some say that the typewriter is a machine, and the typist is just a machine of the machine. All day long, official documents, letters, invoices, receipts, piles of them several inches high in the wire basket, one batch after another, barely giving you a chance to breathe. Sometimes you have to line up ten or twenty sheets of carbon paper. If you don't use enough force, the printing won't be clear, so you have to hit it hard, often causing the flesh on your fingers to separate from the nails, creating wounds that open like mouths, causing pain that pierces your heart. Sometimes you have to use a thirty-two-key typewriter, which is so big and heavy that you almost break your fingers. Sometimes you also have to use blue-green carbon ribbon, making your hands look like you work in a dye shop, and you can't wash them clean. Our manager, although he has never been abroad or gotten any fancy education, adopts some Westernized methods in managing his subordinates, especially for typists. He is particularly meticulous in managing whether the posture is correct—back straight? Is the sound of typing fast and rhythmic? If you want to slack off, light a cigarette, and take a break, you will immediately be "eating big dishes" (getting punished), so after leaving the office every day, I always feel pain in my waist and fingers, dizziness, and blurred vision. But what can I do in order to be driven by the whip of life?</p>
<p>Hard work, hard work, the end of the month arrives, and it's time to collect the salary. Everyone's withered faces are covered with a trace of a smile, but the price of a month's hard work is thirty yuan in legal tender. Fifteen yuan for a month's rent in a small attic has already taken up half of it (and that's a bargain, the sub-landlord is thinking of ways to increase the rent!). Recently, the price of rice has skyrocketed again, with second-grade rice selling for more than sixteen yuan per picul. Firewood, charcoal briquettes, oil, salt, soy sauce, and vinegar are all more expensive than before. How can that fifteen yuan support a family of several people? My wife's belly is getting bigger day by day, and the delivery date is just around the corner. I don't know where the delivery expenses will come from. The children's shoes are torn every day, and their socks are torn, and it's time to get them new ones. As for my worn-out, shiny gown, I'll just make do with it. I remember that next Saturday is the happy wedding of the director's daughter, and those two yuan can't be saved. Next Sunday is the 60th birthday of the manager's mother. This gift cannot be missed either. Thinking of this, I felt a burst of darkness in front of me, and even swallowed the "sigh" and couldn't breathe it out.</p>
<p>Typists are commonly known as "little hammer敲小榔頭" workers, probably a self-deprecating term.</p>
<h3>This Year's Loquats</h3>
<p>— Xu Zhen</p>
<p>Inland transportation involves heavy donations and taxes along the way, and there are many inferior goods, making it difficult for vendors to make money.</p>
<p>The cries of yellow hot plums fill the streets and alleys, and at this time, you can see the loquats with their mixed fur and wearing yellow and red robes.</p>
<p>Loquats are not considered a valuable fruit in Jiangnan. In the early summer and late spring, this thing appears on the streets, and the price is not very expensive. But when it first comes on the market, it is so sour that it is unbearable. Because it is a seasonal fruit, it is used as an embellishment on banquets.</p>
<p>But these days, Shanghai's loquats have reached their peak, filling the streets and alleys, but there are very few loquats coming.</p>
<p>The wholesale market for loquats in Shanghai, like fresh fish and fruits, is in the Sixteenth Settlement. At this time, other fruits cannot be temporarily connected, and loquats are used as a major business in the general fruit shops in the Sixteenth Settlement.</p>
<p>As long as you go to the Sixteenth Settlement, you can see small baskets of loquats placed in front of every store and vendor stall, covered with a red advertising paper, and a piece of wood with the words "Tangqi Big Red Robe" for 65 cents per basket, and "Dongting Mountain White Sand Soft Carving" for 75 cents per basket.</p>
<p>The so-called "Big Red Robe" is a loquat with red skin and red flesh. This kind of loquat comes from Tangqi and is cheap. Although some are sweet, many are sour. If you are not careful, you can only admit bad luck.</p>
<p>The so-called "White Sand Soft Carving" is the best and sweetest loquat in the middle. It is not very big when it is born, but it is very solid, has a lot of water, the flesh is white, and the taste is extremely sweet. This kind of loquat comes from Dongting Mountain in Suzhou. The highest price is 80 cents per basket (about fifty or sixty), and the cheapest price is more than 60 cents.</p>
<p>I talked to some fruit shops in the Sixteenth Settlement about the market conditions for loquats this year. He said that this year's loquat profit is very light, and the days of business are also very short.</p>
<p>It is said that there are not as many loquats this year as in previous years. On the one hand, the donations and taxes along the cards are too heavy. A boat of loquats often has to donate 20 yuan. If it passes through other cards, it will have to donate as well.</p>
<p>They sent people to the mountains of Suzhou to purchase loquats. In the past, they used to take the land route and take the train, and they would be quickly delivered to the mouths of Shanghai people in two days. But now it is not possible. A boat of loquats has to take the waterway, from Suzhou to Jiaxing, and then to Shanghai. Its waterway journey takes at least eight days. Some loquats that are a little greener can withstand the delay, but some loquats that are riper will rot as soon as they arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<p>"Business is not comparable to before!" said a fruit shop owner with anxiety.</p>
<p>They transport the loquats to Shanghai and then wholesale them to fruit stores and vendors. The best common red sand loquats sell for 4 yuan for ten, and the best white sand loquats sell for 6 yuan per ten.</p>
<p>It is said that the loquat season this year is very short. It will probably be sold until the end of the month, and loquats will not be seen on the market.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: Red Powder Eliminates Enmity but Fails to Dissipate Sin, Green Window Discusses Love and Remakes a Good Relationship</p>
<p>Zhao Letian was hospitalized for a long time, and a one-legged person could no longer go to the front line. At that time, he was truly unburdened and the shadow of Pan Peiying gradually faded away. However, the letters Zhao Letian sent to Pan Peiying could never reach her boudoir. All of them were intercepted by her father. Naturally, Pan Peiying could not obtain freedom and was secretly monitored by her father, Pan Xinxin. He knew that this reply to Zhao Letian was forced to write, not out of her own will. To guard against the future that she would write another letter to Zhao Letian, denying that the reply that day was not out of her own intentions. But at that time, her actions had lost freedom and she was monitored everywhere. Even if she wanted to send a letter, it had to go through her father's hands. Peiying initially had this intention. After writing that forced reply, she hurriedly thought of writing another letter to cancel the previous one. Who knew that her father's surveillance was so tight that she didn't even have the chance to write a letter. Moreover, the previous letter did not give her Zhao Letian's address. The whole letter was sent out by her father, Pan Xinxin, without any relaxation. Later, Zhao Letian sent two more letters to Peiying, which were all intercepted and viewed by her father. The first soil (letter) was actually prepared for Peiying, and he verbally abused her father. At this time, her father had already developed an old face. He just laughed and locked the letter in his desk drawer. The so-called "Let him laugh and scold, I will do my own good office," the ancients had already described it perfectly. "I am always cleaner than you!" Her father thought after reading it: "You die, you die in vain, not like us dying, at least we can receive tens of thousands of dollars in pension in the puppet government? But if you really die, we will have some benefits. Because Peiying's father, although he forced his daughter to write a reply yesterday, refusing Zhao Letian, knew that this matter was forced. His daughter still loved this young man. All the expressions and words showed it. Why did he want to monitor her so closely? It was just because he was afraid that if there was any slack, they would still communicate, or even have an agreement to meet and flee together! Just look at her frowning brows and long sighs every day, and she can't arouse her interest in anything! If he really died, Zhao Letian's body died, but Pan Peiying's heart did not die. At that time, or when giving her a match, there are also many beautiful men in the puppet government, or to use this to contact people in high positions, she will not firmly reject my father's New proposal."

<h3>"Secret Service of the Air"</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>“Secret Service of the Air”</p>
<p>Produced by Warner Bros. Shown at the Grand Light Theatre</p>
<p>The story of "Secret Service of the Air" is a copy of "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang" plus "G-Men."</p>
<p>"Gangster Hanlik is the ringleader of a group illegally smuggling people into the country," which is the same as George Aynes and his partners in crime in "G-Men," running a tight transportation company, except that the former is illegally smuggling people into the country and the latter is escorting criminals out of the country. The special agent who investigates this illegal smuggling of people into the country, Boss, "deliberately goes to jail for illegally smuggling counterfeit money, so that he can get close to Hanlik and find out the secrets," which is the same as the journalist in "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang," who deliberately commits a crime to go to jail in order to collect evidence.</p>
<p>"G-Men" and "I Am a Fugitive From a Chain Gang" are the only two examples I can remember, but there are many more stories like this.</p>
<p>"Secret Service of the Air" created a gangster Hanlik who trafficked people, and a special agent Boss who stood in opposition to him. Then Boss won the trust of Hanlik's party member Jim, and then revealed his true colors. At this critical moment, he finally turned danger into safety and wiped out all the party members in one fell swoop. The special agent established great merit, which is also a cliché.</p>
<p>This exposes the ferocity of the gangsters and the shrewdness of the special agents. Perhaps this contrast is the original intention of repeatedly making similar movies? However, because it is necessary to emphasize the wisdom and courage of the special agents, the various wrongdoings of the gangsters are used to set them off. After James Cagney's "The Public Enemy" was banned in Shanghai, I felt that the objective effect after the release of this type of film may be counterproductive. Even from a "business perspective," the dogfights in the planes and the model planes flying in the sky are not new or exciting after seeing them repeatedly.</p>
<h3>Mr. Zhang Feng's Recent Works</h3>
<p>(1) Son, from the War in Henan to Shandong</p>
<p>Ma Bai should pity your youth, who knows that you come from a scholarly family, poetry and books originally have the name of defending the city, and the beacon fire is remotely transmitted from Luoyang. A whistling arrow is good for displaying courage outside the body, and drawing the bow should remember the string in the heart. Your father composes a poem for you, counting the calluses on your shoulders when you return home in armor.</p>
<p>(2) Son, Shanzong, Served in Ba and Dian, Reduced to the Capital</p>
<p>Your son can return from the army to Shanxi, and the eldest son will go to Chongqing to do service. The old man's heart descends like a lion and tiger, and you show off the prestige of the Phoenix and Dragon. What is the use of reading the books of sages and sages? It is difficult to go home and show heroism. Heaven follows people's wishes and my years are reduced, and I can still shoot and control Xiao Rong.</p>
<p>(3) Daughter, Joyfully Defies Wind and Snow to Go to Yunnan to Engage in Industry</p>
<p>The eyebrows and headscarf show that there is no difference between women and men. A daughter goes west again to pack her bags, bidding farewell and returning several times, the journey is long and difficult. Suddenly it becomes easy to throw away home, and silently they are able to plan for the country for a long time. Since she left, there are no words of hardship in her letters, and she is busy raising silkworms by the Nu River.</p>
<p>(4) Brother, Again Goes to the Hunan-Guizhou Road</p>
<p>Building the Liuzhou Section</p>
<p>Younger brother, Xunxun is too thin, and treads the miasmic Jiang river again in the chaos of war. The dangerous car goes to the Ba and Qian roads, and shrinking the ground still builds the city. The fairy can be approached by piercing the fog and clouds, and the danger can be calmed by cooking. The cemetery is in the trap and grows into a long view, and going and staying are discussed by you, clumsy child. (Charity Sale Donation)</p>
