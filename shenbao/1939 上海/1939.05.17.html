<h3 id="c11">國際之誤會 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>是亦幽默之甚，抑且無獨有偶；近日國際·頻以所謂誤會相警惕，相鞭策。原外交辭令中之誤會，輒期以如是云云而諱過·而飾非·而卸責·而息爭，化小化無，趨嚮消極；乃近日所聞之誤會，則氣象萬千，似有大塊文章，繼誤會之後焉。例如本月十日，英國首相張伯倫，爲英蘇談判事，告彼下議院曰，蘇聯似有所誤會；見路透社電。又如本月十一日，蘇聯外交界宣稱，英首相所謂誤會，不知何自而來；見哈瓦斯社電。又如十五日英國外决白特勒，答復下議院議員關於上海前途之質問，謂日本政府對此，不能輕予誤會云；見路透電。張伯倫氏故意疑人以誤會，蘇聯方面佯稱不知所誤會，白特勒氏則誡人以幸母誤會；弦外餘音嫋嫋，皆外交辭令中之妙語也。</p>
<p>上舉三事，我人未欲代爲解釋，代爲說明。顧就國際之一般誤會言之，其虛虛實實，前因後果，常致毫釐千里之殊；而眞實之誤會，每爲當事者所深諉；眞實之破綻，則又每爲當事者所諉爲誤會。以近事而論；英國所誤會者最多，而所予人以誤會之可能亦獨甚。張伯倫氏有綏靖歐局之志，有蘄求和平之誠；乃對於侵略國家野心之有無止境，國際條的之是吾愈於廢紙，歷史的威望能吾控制現實的力量，吝不運用力量之何殊於絕無力量，口頭與書面之譴責可吾獲致懲儆之實效，凡此種種，張伯倫氏在經歷事寶，飽受創痛之前，無一而不誤會。慕尼黑協定卒如具文，而捷克卒不免於淪亡，則犧牲於誤會之著例也。至於國聯盟的之禾能秉公實施，實爲英國所沮；於是英國之是吾敝屣國聯，國聯之是吾自珍其盟的·頗予人以誤會。英國之國旗與使節以及種種條的上之利益，備遭橫逆，而無可如何；於是有無自維尊嚴之決心·頗予人以誤會。對於不合理之詭辯，不兌現之諾言，皆能休休有容；於是英國是吾不可欺，不可侮，頗予人以誤會。屢作辭嚴義正之言，屢示劍及屨及之勢，而卒無切實行動以繼其後；於是是吾虛張聲勢，虛聲恫嚇，頗予人以誤會。循此誤會之極，幾何不使人誤會於英國有海陸大砲，初無砲彈。</p>
<p>夫以英國頻年在國際之遭遇，則艱危萬狀，對國際之態度，則苦心孤詣，固至堪同情者也。去年九月，慕尼黑事誠屬受給。若果不受紿，則迄今數月之間，或旣有數百萬生靈，數萬萬資產，俱歸毀滅；是當時之委曲求全，亦未始無功於人羣。所未可定論者；若奧地利與捷克，其國則喪其獨立，其人則喪其自由；若今日世界全局之密雲不雨，各國麪包之移充軍備；戰禍雖展緩，而他日爆發之時，或更廣更烈更慘；凡此代價，無可估計，則造成此局勢者固未許遽言功罪；而當時之所以應付之者，又何得稱爲至善。試以英國改進其態度後之形勢，與往日比較之；英國夙己表示憎惡侵略，事實則侵略橫行；及倡議組織反侵略集團。於是空氣一變；慨然予波蘭羅馬尼亞以保障，空氣又一變；排除萬難而推進徵兵實施法案，空氣又一變；降格以結土耳其，空氣又爲之一變；是則世人無不承認國際形勢確因英國態度之轉變而稍稍減輕其凶險。易辭申言之，國際一部或全部之凶險，乃往日英國之態度所養成；而最易予人以誤會之種種行止，允非對於國際至善之應付也。誤會所在，罪惡踵之；殷鑒不遠，覆轍可虞；英國當局固將如何務求實效實際，袪除誤會，以制止因緣誤會之罪惡耶！</p>

<p>教部以現在中國外留學生之家在戰區者、為數甚多、應予救濟。愛訂標準。凡公費生其隸屬省份不能續發旅費者，先予塾發國幣七百元、作為三個月生活費，其留學已滿三年以上者。即作為回國旅費、令其回國、至自費生領有留學證書者、如經濟來源斷絕、一律發六百元、作為三個月生活費、或回國旅費之用、但以一次為限、其所習學科適合國家急切需要、留學生未滿三年、確有成績者、得請求救濟、至本年一月底止、接收此項救濟之學生、計二百六十七人、內給生活費者一百五十名、給予回國旅費者一百十七名、（英四九、美七八、法三八、德三八、比一二、義四、瑞士二、丹一、）教部為救濟回國留學生、特將籌畫回國留學生服務一節、列入本年度高教行政計劃之一、愛制定抗戰期間回國留學生登記辦法、自本年二月舉辦登記、如再國外專科以上畢業、或國內大學生畢業后、在國外研究院研究一年以上者、就可能範圍內、按照本人專門研究、分別介紹服務、並得指定相當工作、酌給生活費、如出國前在國內專科以上校尚未畢業、出國后在國外專科以上校亦未畢業者、按照所習學科期試驗及格、得編入正式學級、</p>
<p>今後計劃統制外匯、于留學加以限制、至為需要、惟我國大學研究所、因限於設備與師資、尚未能充分發展、致各種專門技術工作、與多數大學師資仍不能不取材於留學、因此留學政策、不能　然中止、今後教部一面對新生出國將嚴加限制、一面對國防建設需要之人才、將注意培養、其計劃約分數項、（一）修正規行限制留學暫行辦法、在抗戰起價、公費學生、凡非研習急切需要之學科者、一律暫緩派遣、自費留學生、除資格與規定相符、研習科學在核定之列、已得國外獎學金或補助金、無須講購外匯者外、一律暫緩出國、（二）留學生出國已滿三年以上者、一律節令回國、家在戰區經濟困難者、由部酌給回國旅費、其有特殊成績、確需繼續在國外研究者、得呈請延長留學期限、惟應規定名額以示限制、（三）設置留學補助資生學額、月給補助資、此項學額給予之標準、以成績優良、而經濟困難者、為其主要條件、由部組織考核委員會辦理之、（四）整頓留學務、擬在歐美設置管理留學務專員、或就駐外使館指派幹員兼辦、以上各項、限制之迫切需要、過去對於留學歐美學生、尚無切實管理、今后將指派專員主管其事、並對於成績優良之學生出國家予以資助、留學制度、當能較前貫澈而更著成效也、　（完）</p>
<h3 id="c50">美國中等職業教育之特點　指導周密教員隨同學生升級　根據差別設施還無機械趨向　何清儒考察報告歐姆哈城中內容 <a href="#c50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>中華職位教育社四清儒近赴美講學並考察、茲鐘報告錄下、美國中等職業教育、界限並不清楚、普通中學與職業學校多混合設立、專設職業學校者極少、但普通中學中多設職業科目、以為不能升學者之就業準備、故職業趨向極重、歐姆設職科目之最大者、學生約三千六百人、房舍之宏大、設備之周全、不必多所描述僅亂其內容之特點、略舉數端、或可為我國職業教育之參考、</p>
<p>新生探說討　學生在初入中學時、志向本難確定、若必分普通與職業難免分別普通錯誤、且職業眾多、及決定就業、亦難在入學時確定一種、該校一年級（美國中學仍多四年制）課程多係探討性質、不必選定一科、亦不必分別升學就業、除必修課目、如英文、社會學、體育外、選科甚多、均為嘗試性質、以確定個人之興趣、經一年之試後、在按個人知興趣才力、選修各種科目、學校之指導、亦即可在此發生效力、一年級可選修之課程如下、代數、食物、衣著、歐洲歷史鐵工、自由畫、初級科學、普通工廠工作、法文、拉丁、機械畫、印刷、無錢電、金屬板　西班牙文、木工、</p>
<p>科目衆多　中學生可就之職業、本極眾，本錢眾多、學生之興趣亦極複雜、學校雖不能回時訓練社會中所有職業、但就普通需要者設施、似較祗一二科教有選擇、目有多和科目基本訓練、大致相同、故如同設施、更為機構及、該校所社科目、共分三組、茲將各組科目例下、甲·普通及商業組、美術·簿記會計·食品服務·（食堂飯店）服裝·音樂·印刷·零傳術、乙·升學準備組、看護預備·工程·文科及文書、丙·工業組、汽車機械、箱廚工·木工·繪圖·電氣鐵工及模型·機器工廠工作·無綫電、金屬板、</p>
<p>科目伸縮</p>
<p>學生在一年級之尾、決定選入某科、每科中雖有必修課程、如習美術者必須修自由畫、但仍有選科之餘地、可修習別科課程準備升學者、亦可選修簿記·打字、以備萬一不能升學、尚可有一技之長、學生在學校四年中、可按照興趣之發展、環境之變化隨時修改程序、各科改科之可能、並非一人學校即固定途徑、永無更改之機會、</p>
<p>指導周密</p>
<p>關於學生之擇業選科及生活問題　、除由校中總指導員隨時商談指導外、每三十學生、由一級任教員指導該級任教員隨同生升級、故對於學生歷年之情形了解極深、此外每年級有男女教員各一人、專負責指導本年級課程問題、校長對於學生關　極切、常與學生個別談話、學生與學校之關係、有如子弟與家庭、凡事均可商討、絕非寄賴規章之約束、即為了事、</p>
<p>測驗利用</p>
<p>在一年級之尾、學生在決定科目之前、均受各種測驗、如智力測驗、興趣測驗、性向測驗等、指導員之指導、及學生之自審、均參照測驗之結束、故主導極為科學化、效力增大不少、</p>
<p>工讀合作</p>
<p>職業科目之高級生如木工、售買食物等均採取讀合作制、上午課、下午從事實際工作、木工者從事建築房舍、傳賣食物者在店服務、此項實際工作、均由各主任教員負責接洽、介紹各科主任教員、每日有規定時間與有關廠店機關等聯絡、一以明瞭實際需要、一以為學校宣傳、同事即可實行供求之聯絡、學校社會之打成一片、此法極有效力、教員之責任亦因而加重、</p>
<p>總之、美國之中等教育、承認個人之差別設施、極為有伸縮、富有試驗之精神、對於學生因尊重個人之人格、注重自決、注重商討、注重輔導、毫無機械之趨向、職業教育乃整個教育之一部、並非獨立部門、職業教育之目的、使學生有起始工作之能力、至特殊專細之訓練、則需由市級經驗中求之云、</p>

<h3 id="c76">在博物學者家中　鑒賞了一個上午（中）EL　—訪問蘇阿德先生的印象— <a href="#c76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>提要博物學家蘇阿德先生（Auther　De　C．　Sowerby）現任亞洲文會會長。前天上午我到他家裹去訪問他，同時倫敦泰晤士報的馬禮遜君亦在座。蘇先生引導我們參觀他所收藏的古物，親手製作的動物標本，和他的工作室，書室等。下面所記的是接着昨天的上文，那時我們三個人，四條犬正由樓上走下來後的情形。——記者　　有一間房子裏面完全用爪哇陳設佈置的裹面有一位女助手帮着他整理文稿，我沒有進屋子時所聽見的「答答……答」打字機聲，就是發源於此，這是蘇先生的工作塲所。</p>
<p>我們又看了他所藏着的書，關於遠東的旅行，動物，考古等佔大多數，他所最寳貴的，是十年以來的「中國科學雜誌」合訂本。他說：「當他担任編輯的時候，什麼事情都是一手辦理的」，他指着架子上厚厚的幾十巨帙，這是他心血的結晶，也是勞力的收成，好似「粒粒盤中餐」呢！</p>
<p>蘇先生的家，房子本來並不十分寬大，凡是他能利用的地方，差不多全都有東西放着。黑杉木的櫃，櫃，在扶梯轉灣的空隙間，很莊嚴的昂然的站立着，裏面不問而知的內容十分充實。他順手扯開一架書櫥的門給我們看，嘴裏說道：「這一部份全都是關於動物學的書籍。一他又隨手指着一排十多本的書道：一這是專講狗的……」那老是拌住脚跟不肯離開它們主人的幾條大哈叭犬，忽然也湊趣似的，爬起了前脚，在那幾本專講「狗」的書脊上面嗅了嗅，我們的笑聲，隨着脚步的聲音由上而下。　　在沒有下樓之前，蘇阿德先生又曾在他工作室的書櫥中，抽出他先人的一部博物學的著作。當然，他是十分珍視這書的。他鄭重的道：「這是他會祖手澤」，一面把手　動書葉，裏面有很精細的彩色揷圖，那顏色完全是人工所着上去的。我們經蘇先生解釋之後，才知道這些彩色的揷圖，是先有銅版的影底，然後由他的先人把彩色着上去，無怪他鄭重地給我們看，叉很當心的安置在原處了呢。</p>
<p>到了樓下，大家又坐在很安靜的環境中。園子裹綠色的草坪，室中雅適的佈置，東方式的陳設，一切的一切，呌人感覺和平和安靜。我的頭腦中，忽發奇想：假如這位蘇阿德先生所藏着的許多動物標本，都恢復了它們的生命，能够跳躍，飛翔，和鳴呌，那來道一座幽靜的屋子不知要變成什麼樣哩？至少要變成一個小規模的萬牲園，那是毫無疑義的。　　蘇先生招呼我們移坐在靠園子的窗下，那裏有一隻圓面的籘桌，幾把圈椅，我們很舒適的坐了下來。他又拿出啤酒來款待我們！起初他問我要不要用「茶」，我謝答不需，只才大家喝着酒。</p>
<p>我們三人圍着圓桌閒談，沒有什麽可記。我就趁此把我們的盛情主人他的身世經歷介紹在下面；</p>
<p>一八八五年蘇阿德生於中國山西的太原，他是英國傳教士的兒子。最初在芝罘念書，一八九九年，離開中國到英國去，後來進勃列斯多爾大學。一九〇四年，忽動遊歷世界的念頭，他離開英國，浪跡各地。他唯一的心願，就是要看看各地的異花奇草，飛禽走獸。這是他的愛好，在大學念書的時候，即已致力於博物學。</p>
<p>這决遊歷的終點爲坎拿大，他從「溫尼伯」上岸。這時候大家正向着北方移殖，他也被這個瀰天的高潮捲往了「撒喀其萬」地方。他這時　度着流浪的生活，什麼種田，築路，短工等，都要嘗試嘗試。</p>
<p>離了誕生之地日久，他忽動思鄉之念，一九〇五年重返太原。那時他在一位愛好動植物者的教士家中做些工作，他建設博物院的大工作，從這個時候起，就植了基礎。</p>
<p>後來他在天津的「華英書院」教了兩年書，教書教過以後，他決計拋棄那「冷板凳」的生活，而從事於他「夢寐以求」的博物學者生活——旅行狩獵及研究工作。</p>
<p>我寫到這里，可以確定的說，如果那時候蘇先生不立志去做實際工作的博物研究者，那末今天道屋子裹一定要比現在　空得多。除了爲陳設而陳設的幾件所謂「珍奇」的東西以外，家裹決不至於弄成像半爿古董舖和半爿皮貨店的樣子。不客氣的話，他從二十多歲起，就種下了這副研究式的「獃」氣了。</p>
<p>二十九歲上，他跑到山西的北部，那里高山峻嶺，森林極多。他在住在中國的外國人所沒有到過的地方，從事狩獵及採集標本的工作。一九〇七年又返東海濱，爲他曾經服務過的天津「華英書院」創設一所博物院，這在他個人已是「再度劉郎」的二决建設工作了。</p>
<p>有了兩决採集博物材料的經騐，翌年就加入了爲不列顚博物院自然史部採集動物標本的，「彼得福公爵東亞西亞探險隊，」這個探險隊係由已故之安得生氏所領導，由山西陝西直達「鄂多斯」沙漠。</p>
<p>我在上面已經提起過，蘇先生在這决探險工作中所獲得的沙漢鼠樣本，因爲是他所發現的，所以把他的姓繫於這鼠名之後。從前人視得以「附驥」爲榮，蘇先生竟是「附鼠亦可謂爲佳話罷。</p>
<p>第二次的探險，時期　着一年——由一九〇八年秋至一九〇九年夏，蘇阿德先生參加從美國來的百萬富翁克拉克氏的甘肅探險隊，他們爲了華盛頓的美國國民博物院採集了不少動植物標本。　　嗣後蘇先生專門在各處收集標本，寄往上述的博物院，直到一九一七年止。這許多年中，他足跡走遍了華北，華東，東三省和內蒙古。</p>

<p>南京人蔣劍秋（又名兪健明）、素來不務正業、前以偷竊爲生涯、曾經法院一再懲辦、年來彼於備嘗鐵窓風味之後、始悔鼠竊無聊、乃更易方針，以舞女爲目標、遂將所得不義之財、置辦衣履、加以修飾、爰乃涉足舞塲、施展獵艷手段、被惑而與發生關係之舞女、頗不乏人、但彼則</p>
<p>醉翁之意</p>
<p>不在酒、苟得其財、不戀其色、且即顧而之他、故凡失身喪資之舞女、竟無如彼何、茲又以詐騙愛多亞路大華舞塲舞女陸美麗之金飾。鈔幣。收音機等物、始於前日案發被捕、該舞女家住同孚路大中里一百四十號、上年冬間、與蔣相遇於大華舞塲、其時蔣自謂彼係南京路品珍首飾店之小主、陸女見彼</p>
<p>衣冠楚楚</p>
<p>且屬靑年、竟深信之、從此幾於無夜不會於大華、及至陸女舞罷歸去、蔣輙伴送、一種親暱形狀、不啻伉儷、故不久彼此俱願結爲終身伴侶、陸女益受迷惑、迨至上月十五日以後、蔣見時機業已成熟、遂開始施展其欺騙偷竊之慣技、初尙小試其端、僅騙收昔機一架、繼則僞造與其父母之</p>
<p>遺書一通</p>
<p>大致言彼矢志娶湯小姐（即陸美麗）爲妻、而遭父母反對、致使美滿婚姻、無從實現、故彼決計自殺、惟望父母勿予悲傷等語、乘間以該信先與陸女閱看、陸女固目不識丁者、當持挽同屋之人閱之、而蔣即於此一刹那間、將陸女室內所儲現鈔三百元及鑽戒等飾、竊取逃逸、迨陸女回房發覺</p>
<p>人財兩空</p>
<p>方悟被蔣愚弄、以往情愛、實屬虛偽、當開失單、報告捕房、請求查究、前日經成都路捕房中西幹探偵悉蔣之匿跡所在、馳往拿獲、吊出原贓收音機等物、惟現鈔祇剩十餘元矣、昨晨解送第一特區地方法院、由方推事開庭提審，捕房律師張師竹將被告所犯詐欺情形、陳述之下、並聲明據</p>
<p>該舞女稱</p>
<p>被告以此手段、許騙其他舞女財物、巳非一决、故請求改期、以便繼續調查、旋由陸美麗投案訴明被告欺騙偷竊之經過事實、質之蔣、供詞支吾、庭上遂諭被告收押、改期再訊、贓物贓款、先還原主領去、</p>

<p>吾人試翻開科學發達史，或科學名人之傳紀，所得最深印象，即科學中之偉人皆壽命甚長。如奈端，達爾文，巴思德等無不年逾古稀。然尚有不止於是，直享受至九十以上，而聰明猶強，著述不輟者。如英之沃來斯，德之安格勒與翁德等皆是。其餘凡在科學界有偉大成就，從不能人人克瑧遐齡，然以平均而論，其享長壽者要居百分之七十以上也。若就其平生事蹟以考究之，則知其所以能如此者誠非無因。蓋科學家盡終身之力，從事於格物致知之功，其思想乃極純潔，道德自然高尚，精神逐日形矍樂，此其一。所做之工作有一定之常規，其一切公休，起居，飲食，皆有條不絮，最合自然之定律，換言之，即最合乎衛生也，此其二。研究日深，窺見自然界之奧妙，功力既至，左右逢源，有極大之娛樂，此其三。科學之中，有無窮盡之問題，一問題得以解決，又有新現象連帶發生，既解決一問題，得相當之快慰；更進而研究新問題，朝朝暮暮，長有無限之希望，其與趣乃愈養愈濃，此其四。科學家最實貴其時間，愛惜其精力，一心從事於研究，不願妄費其力於無謂之事，凡社會上之足以　喪人生健康之娛樂，皆不能波及之，此其五。有此數原因，科學家工作愈入，成績愈宏。因研究科學而得長壽，亦唯因長壽而能成為大科學家，此乃互相為因果者。近世生物學發達，衛生營養之常識，尤治科學者所習聞，茲後科學家大家之登上壽者，將更指不勝屈矣。</p>

<p>— 禾士</p>
<p>其一</p>
<p>虎係食肉之動物，性最猛驚，中國中部各大山中有之，南方閩粵等處有之，東北各省亦有之，此其最近分佈之大略也。中西部如峨眉山，嵩山，太行山等處之虎，色較黃，體長而足稍短。華南之虎與孟家拉灣所產者相同。七八十年之前。上海不如今日之人煙稠密，城郊荒涼之處，會一次發見此處之蹤跡，是其分佈，直由孟加拉灣至閩粵而江浙矣。此虎色點黃，體較短而高，與印度之虎相近。惟印度虎色較淡白而體更高耳。東北各省之虎，西人呼為滿洲虎，其色白，偶有藍色者，此乃極少見者耳。吾國今日所有之虎不過如是。在動物分類學上皆係一種，其學名為Felistigris。上言各種，不過皆是變種，不得歌為一種也。傳聞虞山亦有虎之發見，然今日森林日少，人居日眾，必已絕跡矣。</p>
<p>其二</p>
<p>虎之所以為猛獸者，以其兇勁異常，然荀夫其爪牙，則英雄無所用武矣。嘗記有玩虎者，逢場作戲。余人觀之，果見一虎，體偉而神凜，一鐵鏈勢其項，涫於木椿之上。虎見觀眾，其眼閃耀，繞椿旋走，作欲噬之狀。一壯漢持棒與虎相搏，虎抓以爪，噬以口，壯漢無懼，而亦卒無所傷。最後舉棒而大赫之，虎蹲而怒之以目，無可如何。眾疑此漢有魔術焉，及審觀之，虎口中無牙，足上無爪，從有猛力，亦無所施耳。蓋玩者得此虎時，已將其爪牙斬錯以去，如此可用以營利。好事者以牛肉投之，虎一吞而下咽。玩者調此虎係來自峨眉，然其人由中州音，或係得之嵩山或太行山也。</p>
<h3 id="c105">炭烯氣 <a href="#c105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— 心君</p>
<p>安全的麻醉劑　水葉的催熟劑</p>
<p>看見卡內熏（Oaination）的人都知道它是一種很美豔的花。在1908年，有一個垂頭喪氣的賣花人請問芝加哥大學裏兩位博士南特（Krocker）：當冷天的時候，他將花房裏的通風器關閉，預防冷氣侵入，損害花卉。結果是接連三個年頭，花房裏卡內熏總是不興旺，在第三年以上，他發覺有一些煤氣的臭味。仔細尋查，才知道有一個漏氣的煤氣管。修好之後，卡內熏居然照常生長得好了。這是什麽道理呢？</p>
<p>原來卡內熏的苞和花，對於煤氣很有靈敏的感覺。空氣中有了煤氣二萬分之一，在十二小時內已經會市中等的花苞枯萎了；四萬分之一，會使將開的花苞萎謝；八萬分之一，會使已開放的花萎縮不能再開了。</p>
<p>煤氣是用煤放在鐵瓶裏干蒸出來的，裏面包含一氧化碳，氫氣，炭烯氣以及種種旁的氣，混合在一起。在這許多氣體中間，炭烯氣（Kchylene）對於最有關係。空氣之中有了二百萬分之一，在十二小時之內，可以使卡內熏萎謝。化學試驗卻沒有像這樣靈敏的方法，會在二百萬分之中試出這一份的炭烯氣的氣。經過研究之後，才知道卡內熏還不算靈敏，現有別的植物，像番茄丹參草，麻豆之類，過到一千分之一的炭烯氣氣，生長就受妨礙了，當然也有許多植物，對於煤氣或炭烯氣絲毫沒有什麽影響的。</p>
<p>植物的根在泥土里也會給煤氣所損傷。這又是炭烯氣鬧的亂子。在泥土裏雖然氣要相當的濃，才會傷根。但是泥土自會吸收煤氣到這樣的濃度的。煤氣可以積入泥土，達到樹根，在幾星期中間樹就死了。然而地面上毫不覺得有臭味。煤氣公司當然不歡迎植物學家來發見這種事實，但是因此而引人注意，則於公業是很有益處的。</p>
<p>炭烯氣對於植物有上面所說這種奇怪的影響。對於動物呢，要多到十分之八以上（80，85％）再和以氧氣，即成為很好的麻醉劑，要比醚，哥羅芳一氧化氮等麻醉劑都好。因為不致醉死，沒有發汗的作用，不會使病人嘔吐或感覺不適，並且醒得很快。所以有許多外科手術上，值得使用這新的麻醉劑。</p>
<p>無論什麽碳化合物燃燒的時候，要是氧氣不足，或是氧氣雖足而溫度太低，燃燒就不完全，就有一氧化碳和炭烯氣這兩種氣化成。譬如燒紙片，垃圾，火油爐，以及吸支煙，雪茄，煙斗等常發生這種情形的。</p>
<p>在美國，有些地方製藥水果，常用火油爐。後來知道並不是因為火油爐的熱，但是因為它燃燒不完全時候所發生的氣。就是汽車引擎所排出的氣也是一樣有效的。但是用火油爐很要小心，常會使果子受著煙灵變黑，並且使橘類變黃的結果沒有一定的把握，又有火災的危險。後來經美國化學家研究之後，知道如用炭烯氣很有效驗，從空氣一百萬分之中含一份炭烯氣到五千份中含一份炭烯氣為止；溫度亦可高可低。所以在美國加州現在普遍的應用這種簡單的方法使橘子變黃，比較從前，時間上可以減省到一半，管理上又準確得多。同樣的要促進難蜜的成熟，本來需要放在花房裏熏製，其實也是炭烯氣的效用。</p>
<p>古人說：「揠苗助長」是喻性急妄為有損無益的意思。到了化學發明之後，可以有助長的方法，不必「揠」了。這種方法就是用藥或助長劑，像謎和哥羅芳都有這種功用。但是這些東西的濃度要配得好，若是過濃了，也就弄成「揠苗助長」的結果。因為這些麻醉劑毒性是很高的。如用炭烯氣就沒有這種危險。譬如對於橘類果子，炭烯氣差不多可以隨便使用，不致於損害。將來或者發見別種氣體像炭烯氣之類，是更好的助長劑。科學一天一天的進步。人類的享用也跟著增加了。</p>

<p>— 茸人</p>
<p>羅萬（George　Roemmerr）博士去演在一滴水中的生活么魔世界將為紐約世界博覽會中成司饤霍斯電器公司展寛場上最引人至於的一件事情，博士把一滴水置在玻璃片上，用顯微映像器把這滴水中的微生物映在一幅直徑五尺的幕上。各種微生物均房大二千倍，形色完全和原物相同。這種單細胞動物的生產，戀愛，飲食，死亡等種種生活，通常肉眼所不能見者，無不形容畢露，人人可見。附圖為博士十二種顯微映像器所表演的一種。這種微生物活躍的狀態常顯著。但是如用威司玎霍斯所製的消毒燈把四光綫集中在這一滴水的世界上時，這班生物隨即發抖，縮　，破裂，以致滅亡。</p>
<h3 id="c108">兜圈子 <a href="#c108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— 橋下客</p>
<p>兜圈子就是認定一個方向繞園兒，結果還是接近出發點。可是圈子有兩種兜法，情形雖極相似而最後的成績裕相提並論。第一種好比城頭上出棺材。繞了一個整勸兒回來，仍舊到了老地方；用科學術語來講，就說這整圈兒是在一個平面裏邊繞的。第二種是螺旋式的圈子，雖然繞的時候方向一樣不變，但是回到出發處的時候，就會發見原來已高升了，老地方降到我的腳下去了；用科學術語來講，就說這種繞法得時時離開他固有的平面，用第一種繞法，繞完了一千次一萬次還是老地方，用第二種繞法，繞完了一千次一萬次後就入雲霄了，所以說，成績是不能相提並論的。</p>
<p>從前私塾裏的教書，老是那一套，同城頭上出棺材毫無二致，所以兜了二百年的圈子，繞來繞去仍在一個平面上。教授科學就不同了。大家都說科學總在進步，但是進步的形式是怎樣的呢？像風箏一樣，一陣風就吹上天嗎？像登峨眉一樣，上了又下，下了又上，雖後來終達金頂嗎？我很希望有時候放風箏，我不否認有時像登峨眉，但我現在要說的是螺旋式的進步，同一兜圈子，而結果與從前的私塾大不相同</p>
<p>引證的材料是村　都解的。四十年前，我們廚房裏邊用的鹽是灰黑色的，當然因為不純淨的緣故。除了食鹽本身（即純淨的氯化鈉）之外，尚有其他雜鹽在內，大概同海水內各種鹽質的比例差不多。該項雜鹽著於吸收水份。以後科學進步，廚房的鹽也受了提煉的洗禮，於是雪白的就代替了灰黑的。同時醫學方面，鼓吹鈉對於人身有如何如何的好處，而鈉的同件氯氣則被認為與水腫有關的壞蛋。不到三十年，一個圈子兒過來了。與水腫病（如水鼓漲等）有關的壞蛋是鈉而非氯，而且鈉必須與其他雜鹽（如鈣，如鉀）在相當比例之下，才於人體有益無損。這個比例就同海水內鹽質的比例差不多。啊喲，我們還是用灰黑色的鹽罷了。假使我們還買得到那樣的鹽，天天吃著，也許有人說，你們這些研究科學的鬧什麽鬼把戲，鬧了三十年又「復古」了，可見舊有的習慣是對的，青衣改動不得。罪過罪過，這類的現成話往往　惑民眾的耳目，不得不加以批判。三十年後吃的黑鹽，是知其所以然的吃，可說是明明白白的吃，從前我的祖老太太也吃黑鹽，她卻不知其所以然的吃？在糊糊塗塗的吃。同一吃黑鹽而發見祖老太太竟站在下邊，可見這個圈兒決不在一個平面上繞，是螺旋式的進步。無奈那些與祖老太太站在一起的人們，還沒有趕到上面的一個平面，就其喘吁吁，哼哼唧唧的抱怨起來　，所以我舉一例百的位置剖判如此。</p>

<h3 id="c129">口才 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>中國從古以來，便有游說之士，專以口才取卿相，可見口才的效用是很大的。蓋口才除了可以做官以外，還有下列各種效用：</p>
<p>不爲入屈。有些人往往能够出入萬馬千軍，却對了人吶吶不能措一辭，吃盡寃枉之苦。有口才的人便不然，仟憑有多少人和他辯難，他都可以應付裕如，佔盡勝利，諸葛亮的舌戰羣儒，便是道一例。</p>
<p>解人之危。一言九鼎，一諾千金，是說言語的力量。然而假使話很說得巧妙，一樣也可以爲人解圍，謝道韞的搭救「小郎」，便是這一例。</p>
<p>到了現在，口才的用處，更爲廣大，原因是國民人人都應該顧問國家大事，社會公務，處處都須演講或議論。孔門的「言語」一科，到如今已經成爲各校的必修科了，所謂「演講會」，「雄辯會等，都是操練口才的組織。而今當國家多事之秋，宣傳抗戰救國的種種事項，允非口才不可。</p>
<p>然而有利必有弊，固然是古今來的通例，而口才的弊多利少，似乎又是不可掩的事實：</p>
<p>說謊就是口才的不良作用。蓋說謊必須有口才，否則聽者便會不信。有口才的說謊，的確可以說得天花亂墜，寳雨繽紛，使死人都活起來；至於騙殺個把人而不必償命，允其是常事。今之所謂吹牛者，也可以歸入說謊這一欄，因爲所吹的原是不經之談，悠謬之言，與謊同一泉源。</p>
<p>諂媚是口才的另一種不良作用。蓋雖有拍馬屁之心，而無拍馬屁之口才，則馬屁必定拍在馬脚上，有如前淸某富翁那樣，稱頌某中堂時，却會說：「久仰大人老奸巨猾，爲朝野所畏。」善拍馬屁者，必對共人說，我知道你不吃馬屁，其人必大喜而去，許以爲知己。</p>
<p>因此，孔老夫子雖然在他的「杏壇大學」裹，設有「言語專修科」，却最恨道種會說會話的人，稱之爲「佞人」。他曾直直爽爽斥責過：「禦人以口給，屢憎於人，焉用佞！」他天動肝火而誅少正卯時，在少正卯的罪狀中，也有「言僞而辨」這一條。</p>
<p>此外，宋太祖的對付徐鉉，也實在是一大快事：據說，徐鉉代表南唐，來修貢例，爲了他的善於詞令，一時竟揀不出一個可以應付他的人來。後來宋太祖却親自揀了一個不識字的「侍中」官，便有了以下的結果：「始，鉉詞鋒如雲，旁觀駭愕，其人不能答，徒唯唯。鉉不測，强聒而與之言。居數日，旣無酬復，鉉亦倦且厭矣！」</p>
<p>不過口才這一「科」中，還包括着「罵」道一個「系」，我不曉得這算是正當的，還是不正常的。因爲一說起罵，人人心頸便有一種惡感，以爲至少這是不客氣的表示，是侮辱他人，是自墮人格的行爲，於是村婦罵鄰，醉漢罵座，便被列爲人生之惡德。然而我們一看到諸葛亮罵死王郎，心頭便是一陣痛快；焦大罵榮寗兩府，只是石獅子是乾凈的，也不免爲之存一大白。這如何不呌我們拍案　讚說；罵得好呀罵得好！</p>
<p>原來罵決不是無動於中而憑空生出來的；眞正的罵，也決不是上司的呵斥屬員，老板的呵斥夥計，不過發發脾氣擺擺威而已，總是心中實在按耐不住所以才傾筐倒篋，一發而不可收拾。這樣的罵，往往是絕妙的口頭文章，口才。古時有敲牙割舌，噀血爲賊至死的忠臣，也有裸體罵賊，以解城圍的老妓，其例很多。</p>
<p>歸結起來，假使我們的口才，不能善用之於正途，不爲人屈，解人之危，也不便惡用之於歪途，說謊，諂媚，我看，我們還是盡用之於不正不歪途，揀當今應罵之人，痛痛快快地罵到他上天無路，入地無門！</p>
<h3 id="c130">賣豆（下） <a href="#c130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— 明校</p>
<p>『哈哈，對了，我看見你的時候你還小呢。』她表示了他鄕遇故知的神情。『你一直在外面的吧？』</p>
<p>『是的，我一直在這繭行裹當差的。』</p>
<p>接着她問了他許多關於繭行裏的事情，他也問了她一些來這鎮上賣豆的經過。他們越說越親熱，果然像親戚一樣。所不像的，是他坐着，她還立着，表示一個是喝茶的，一個是作買賣的。</p>
<p>『你現在覺得很好吧？』她話鋒一轉，就低低地問出了這句話。</p>
<p>『這也難說，……』他的聲音也低了。</p>
<p>『金根！』在他們談得好久之後，對面底下有人在喊着，他就立起身來預備走，一面答應着『夾了，』一面就伸手到衣袋裹去掏錢。</p>
<p>『明天算吧，我還有幾天躭擱呢。』老奶奶連忙止住他</p>
<p>『好，明天算。』金根下去了。</p>
<p>明天，他果然又吃了她的豆，又和她談了好一會。他下樓去時，她還是不要他掏錢，仍說，『明天算吧。』</p>
<p>可是，到了這一個明天，他到這茶樓上來時，就找不到她的影踪了。他想她也許明天再會來，所以就不放在心上。</p>
<p>然而她到底沒有再到這個茶樓上來，因爲她已經回到她的家裹去了。</p>
<p>我們一看見她回來，沒有一個不大表歡迎的。</p>
<p>『有好消息帶回來了，大家聽着吧！』王明源首先就喊了出來。</p>
<p>『沒有什麼好消息，』老奶奶將眉上的布袋放到桌子上時說，『這裹還剩有一些豆，倒可以給你們吃吃』。</p>
<p>『什麼？那裹來這幾種豆？』倒在桌子上的豆，大家都看見了。</p>
<p>『賣剩的。』</p>
<p>『你去賣豆的？那末消息呢？』</p>
<p>『啊喲，忘了，』她故意失驚地說，『我只知道賣豆，却忘了大事。』</p>
<p>『說吧說吧。』大家知道她開玩笑。</p>
<p>『眞的忘了；你們將這些豆分別揀在一起，數一數，也許我就會記起來。』大家都不懂她的意思。但相信她總有道理，所以就依她的話，一一弄好。</p>
<p>『　沙豆有幾粒？』她問。</p>
<p>『最少，只有三粒。』</p>
<p>『那末告訴你們：小鋼砲最少，只有三尊。』</p>
<p>『哦！』大家這才明白過來，不的而同地透了這一口氣。</p>
<p>『臨浸豆呢？』</p>
<p>『六粒。』</p>
<p>『這是重機關槍。』</p>
<p>此後是五香豆十四粒，輕機關槍；發芽豆一百十八粒，步槍。</p>
<p>『還有濩酥豆一百八十二粒，是什麼呢？』末了，王明源等不及的問。</p>
<p>『這還嬰說麼，』老奶奶笑笑，『槍砲之外，還有什麽我們要曉得呢？』</p>
<p>『該死，』王明源也笑了起來，『我竟這樣的糊塗。』</p>
<p>老奶奶又在桌子上將各種豆另外分配了一下，指着一堆一堆的豆對大家說：</p>
<p>『這是駐在東栅口五龍園澡堂子裹的；道是駐在中市公大繭行的；這是……』</p>
<p>她口講指劃，非常淸楚，使大家的頭腦中留下了深刻的印象，就好像到靑鎭去親自看來的一樣。</p>
<p>『現在你們眞的將這些豆吃了吧。』她講完之後說。</p>
<p>『好，我吃機關槍！』</p>
<p>『我吃……』</p>
<p>在一陣歡笑的空氣中，桌上的豆吃得一粒都沒有。不過這些豆所代表的事情，却已經另外有人紀錄下來，豆也的確沒有用了。</p>
<p>過了幾天，上海的報紙上有靑鎭一度被克復的詳細紀載，也有着王明源等的名字，却沒有想到老奶奶。誰會相信賣豆的老奶奶會和這事有關係呢？就是李金根到現在還在詫異她不來向他算豆錢呢！</p>

<p>這是在囚獄內，牢籠中，雖然我們有着腿，能使我們離開這不願停留的地方，可是，沒有路，使我們躊躇了！</p>
<p>這是路，使入類能生存，不會陷入絕境中。這是路，使人類得到自由，不給鐵鍊束縛。</p>
<p>有了路，我們不怕一切的黑暗，一切的障礙，我們能進行，我們能遠離我們不利的所在！</p>
<p>世界上每一個人，都愛護着路，允其是光明之路，更有着無數的人在希望着，留戀着。</p>
<p>可是，路是人造的，牠不似高峯峻嶺，大江大海，以及一切草木蟲魚，鳥獸和人，是天然的，或是有着造物者的幻力！</p>
<p>我們的祖先，爲了生存，爲了自由解放，更爲了不願捨離這世界，他們造了無數的路，自己用，或是留給子孫。</p>
<p>時代巨輪給了我們，築成的路，已成了一個很大的「數」，使我們安逸地進行。</p>
<p>可是，這些路上，却有着無數的人類的敵人，他們會造出許多阻礙，更施行許多破壞，使我們陷入黑暗的深淵中。</p>
<p>這是我們施展力量的時侯，毫無猶疑地，向他們反抗，進攻，奪回這光明的路！</p>
<p>那無數未開拓的路，能使我們到達更光明的國土裏，我們該以全付的精神，威力，開關新路！</p>
<p>我們是一羣路工，也是」羣路人，在不久，我們將高歌，凱旋！</p>

<p>— 兪</p>
<p>我們領袖最近廣播演講「國民精神總動員，」其中有幾句十分警惕的敎訓，可作我們今後爲人的方針：他說：『我們要加強我們精神的堡壘。一個人要爲國家盡忠，爲民族盡孝，爲痛苦的同胞盡仁愛，對一切的人類盡信義，還要盡一切的奮鬥力量，在這個粉擾黯淡的世界中，求取眞實永久的和平。』這就是說，我們必須恢復固有的道德，發揮我們的精神力量，而後我們努力於可貴的失業，對國家和社會有所建樹。</p>
<p>我們要陶鑄我們的精神生活，發揮我們在精神力量，必須要有一位超絕古今的教主，做我們的精神後盾，這位到底是誰呢？便是捨身救世的耶稣基督！</p>
<p>耶稣基督在他一生的奮鬥過程中，無時不在喚醒他的同胞精神，以圖掙脫惡勢力的侵壓，光復自由的祖國。同時他更不分國族的要改造人類的罪惡生涯，而達到聖善的地步，終於盡其責任犧牲了自己的生命。所以耶穌眞的已經爲國家盡忠，爲民族盡孝，爲痛苦同胞盡仁愛，並對一切的人類盡信義。他那犧牲博愛的精神，與其崇高卓絕的人格，不但足爲我們的精神領袖而有餘，且可作萬世的表率而不替。親愛的同胞們！願你們能夠認識他！</p>

<p>今得柳攸先生來信，願以本刋在四月二十一日所登的「山峯上」和四月二十七日所登的「醉」，兩篇稿贊，充作義賣　金。柳攸先生這樣的熱心，是値得稱頌的，希望諸同文也能够一致奮起，竭盡文人報國的力量。</p>
<h3 id="c135">「義賣」和「義送」 <a href="#c135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— 丁三</p>
<p>最近，某校的同學，曾經縫繡了手帕，結紮了紙花，舉行「義賣獻金」。這是顯示出：靑年學生，救國並非無門。像這樣地去做小生產，小義賣，小獻金，也是救國的一個方法；不一定要上前錢去搖旗吶喊的。</p>
<p>在前，該校普「甲的一班同學（共四十餘人），募集了六十多元，買了十八打黑襪子，在某星期日下午，長途地步行到孤軍營中去慰勞。在買襪子時，襪廠老闆聽說他們去慰勞孤軍，而孤軍又正需用襪子（這是他們去信詢問而後知道的），就加贈了兩打，湊滿了二十打。這班同學掏腰包買襪子去慰勞，可以說是「義送」，而襪廠老闆加贈襪子，自然也是「義送」。爲何耍「義送」？是因爲那三百多孤軍，曾爲保衛國土而死戰，會爲愛護國旗而流血，而將來他們一定能够再度爲國戰鬥。總之，是爲了「救國」。</p>
<p>近兩月來，我會「義買」過，也曾「義送」過；但因瑣務紛繁，神思沉滯，加以寒熱，頭痛，不能好好地提起筆做賣買　，所以不會跟着「文化工作者義賣運動」，實在很覺慚愧。不過，我却曾爲同學們所辦的刊物壁報之類，來過四五决文章「義送一。這樣來幾决義賣」的「義送」，似乎與國無關，其實却有相常關係，——爲了特殊的影響，即使是很小的部份的影響！</p>
<p>「義賣」是完全「獻金」的，那末「義買」的也當存一點「默金」的心思，不要嫌那貨物的粗糙，應當慷慨地多挪出幾個錢來。</p>
<p>「義送」呢，送錢，送物，自然都好，但是送力，送精神，也未嘗不好。只要有利於抗戰建國，那末無論送什麼，無論送給誰，都是好的。像我這種入不敷出的人，老實說，雖然不能多多地送錢送物，不過，送力，送精神，當可以送下去的。</p>
<p>抗戰以來，許多的戰士，把血肉，把生命都送掉了，而貢獻給國家。沒有喪生的後死者，以及有着多餘的力，多餘的精神，多餘的錢者，以及洪運亨通而發着抗戰財者，若還不肯「義送」，那還算是中國的國民，豈不慚愧！</p>
<p>所以，我主張，「義賣」　金的運動，固應擴大而持續，但進一步，更應把「義送」獻金，獻物，獻力，獻精神的運動，加緊推行，擴大，而發揚之！</p>
<p>大家爲了抗戰建國而起來義賣呀，「義送」呀！（義賣獻金）</p>

<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>專為勞動大衆服務　設有職工補習學校</p>
<p>滬西的一角，勞勃生路的一段，一般的人稱謂「大自鳴鐘」的，那地方是非常的熱鬧。雖然是一個工人的區域，但以市況說來，有郵局，有銀樓，有此較規模大些的綢緞店，茶食店……總之，在滬西一帶的馬路之中，這地方可算唯我獨尊，挺熱鬧的了。不拘那一天，我們走去，總是可看見大廢價的彩色旗子在飄蕩，引誘顧客的洋銅鼓，洋喇叭在吹打。然而本文所要介紹的，並不是那邊的市況，而是為一個在勞工葉的隊伍中服務的團體—滬西公社。</p>
<p>滬西公社正和滬東公社遙遙抖對，同樣是為勞動大眾服務的機關，祗是一個在滬西，另一個在滬東而已。滬西公社右青年會設立的，因為青年會鑒於滬西一帶，特別是勞勃生路相近，工廠很多，到處是有著棚戶區域，好多勞工集中在那邊，缺少提倡正當的娛樂和普及勞工教育的機關，所以就在大自鳴鐘的鄰近，設立一個滬西公社。自從設立以來，到現在也有著相當悠久的歷史。</p>
<p>規模是很小的，場合也並不大，我們走到勞勃生路，經過了大自鳴鐘，再向西走了幾步，在商店林立的市房中，突然發現一例竹籬笆的門口掛著一方「滬西公社」四個大字的橫額，旁邊掛有「職工補習晨夜校」的牌子，那就是滬西公社。打籬笆裹望進去，一塊不很大的操場上面，樹有籃球架，小足球門，便是滬西公社的運動場。再裹面是一個木板釘成鵝蛋房子，像營房樣的成了長方形，便是滬西公社的辦公處，課室，閱報處等設備的場合。</p>
<p>滬西公社的工作範圍也是很廣，活動的中心，上面說過，以勞工為對象。德育方面：每個禮拜有牧師傳教；智育方面：設立職工補習學校，分晨班夜班，使滬西一帶的勞動大眾，得以利用業餘的時間，補習各種功課：體育方面：不拘兒童，成人，時常可在那裹踢球，及作各種運動。更備有各種日報，供人閱覽，和出借書籍。</p>
<p>除了這些經常的設備和工作以外，「八一三」之前，那邊更時常舉行各種展覽會。像衛生展覽：每年到了夏天，應是要舉行，喚起一般勞動大眾對夏令衛生的注意，並灌輸衛生常識。所以我們偶然打那邊走過時，特別是例假的日子，每會看見有許多人在裹面運動或看書閱報。滬西這樣的工人區域，滬西公社那樣的機關，的確是需要的，我以為。</p>

<p>— 李秋梧</p>
<p>退票罰款手續費簿子費等名目繁多</p>
<p>十三元幾角存了二年還需找進若于</p>
<p>過去，銀行錢莊對外往來放款，非常慎重，除掉殷實商行而外，普通店號，均要介紹人，和保證人。如果往來商號，或有錯誤事件發生，便要受到很厲害的指責。所以普通商店，對錢莊銀行，都有「老東家」的稱調。</p>
<p>近幾年來，市上忽然產生了許多銀號，在報上大登廣告，不但不要保證和介紹人，祗須五十或二十元，便可開戶。還有大贈品，額外奉送皮夾的饒頭。因著這樣的優待和宣傳，在八一三前，我有一位在兩北開雜貨店的朋友，便存入了五十元，和一家開設比較多年的某銀號往來。</p>
<p>八一三戰事爆發，朋友的店犧牲無餘，但是算算某銀號的往來摺子，還有十三元幾角錢多餘。於是拿著摺子，往某銀號支取餘款，預備作逃難的川資。銀號裹夥計說：奉政府命令，抗戰時期，禁止提存。（其實常時財部命令，須滿三百元以上存款，才有此項限制。）我的朋友，以為這是政府命令，應該服從，便東欠西借，逃回了江都故鄉。</p>
<p>今年二月間，我的朋友重由回到上海來，難民生活，非常可憐，於是重又拿著兩年前的存摺，想向某銀行拿出來。夥計先生翻了翻簿子，撥了撥算珠，把面孔一揚，向我的朋友道：存款沒有了，照算還要找我幾角錢，大家老交易，馬馬虎虎算了罷！</p>
<p>我的朋友聽了夥計這翻答簡直丈二金剛，摸不著頭腦，試想：天下那有存錢倒貼利息的事情咧！倒疑心夥計纏錯戶頭，於是軍行把摺子拿了出來，給夥計看了一下，又加耐煩的回答了，帳是不錯的，你這款子，還是八一三以前所多下來，我們這裹章程，存款要收手續費，簿子費和票貼費，你二三年不來提取，早給這些雜費沖銷了。我的朋友到底是老上海，知道上海社會的情形，知道魚落貓口，還有什麽話說，向他索了一份細帳，氣喘喘的跑出了。</p>
<p>朋友來如此這般的告訴我。但是我始終不相信。可是事有湊巧，無意中，遇到一位服務在錢莊裹的朋友，我便將上面這些事賞報告了他，他不假思索的笑著我道：上海會做生意的人多著哩！你看，無數沒有介紹和保證的拮据商人，那一個不感着沒有銀錢往來的痛苦，現在，忽然有無須保證，介紹，祗要三五十元開戶，便可領用支票往來的銀號，那一個不情願，那一個不歡迎哩？於是，存款付進，支票領來，一萬五千，聽你自由打出，何等寫意！等到支票到期，款項無法張羅，自然又免不了要退票。銀號老板，看準這個弱點，於是冠冕堂皇的說：為限制退票起見，每退票一張，罰銀三角。譬如這銀號平均每日退票數額，約三百張，每張罰款三角，每天退票收入，便有九十元，開支即綽有裕餘。其他，雖並未支用款項，亦須票貼，及手續費，更是名目繁多，不一而足。所以某銀號去年盈餘驚人，無怪要引起同業眼紅，所以，今年市上的銀號，又多出幾家了。</p>

<p>天下之事，有金錢所買得到者，亦有金錢所買不到者，即如英國願以以一萬萬美金，借貨西班牙，使其保持中立，此決不可能之事也。非特一萬萬美金，即幾個一萬萬美金，亦恐辦不到，何也？西班牙尚有後襄老關在也。反侵略集團組織，蘇聯向英提出相互保障的答案，即蘇聯向英國提供保障之後，英國亦須給予保障，此公道也。權利與義務，原是相對的，天下無無權利之義務，亦無無義務只權利，識破此點，其事好辦矣。</p>

<p>第十回　椎髻青裙賢良有母　銀髯翠袖矍鑠是翁</p>
<p>她們一齊到了朱村長的草堂前，朱村長也迎接到階前來。何家兩位小姐舉目瞧時，只見朱村長身穿一件藍布袍子，禿了個白鬢須的頭，臉上黑裹泛紅，慈祥之容可掬，胸前銀髯披拂，直垂至腹。一條膀子是沒有的了，但袖子還是有的，飄飄然空懸在那裹。一望而知是一位慈愛的老人了，何家兩位小姐，連忙翹前鞠躬致敬。朱村長笑吟吟的說道：『聽得愛人說：兩位小姐是她在美國時最要好的同學。難得到我們這裹來，不我們這個小村子，實在是荒陋不堪，不足一觀的。兩位小姐到敞村來，只是意慢得很，如何是好？』照江蘇一帶的習俗，對於同學的父母，稱之為伯父伯母。對於同學的祖父母，便稱之為太老伯，太伯母了。現在何家兩位小姐，對於朱村長，小了兩輩，也應稱呼為太老伯。又因為她們和愛人，親愛得如同手足一般，好似愛人的祖父，就是她們的祖父，因此她們也喚他為公公。對於朱太太應得呼她為伯母的，有時也呼她為媽媽，以見親熱之意。這時招待到朱村長的草堂坐下，朱太太就要到廚房下，安排留客吃飯的佳肴。愛人也要想來幫她媽媽的忙，朱太太笑著把她推開來道：『小姐，你是弄不來的。要是你來幫我的忙，那眞是越幫越忙了。你給我乖乖的去陪著客人去吧！』朱愛人也知道自己是的確幫不來忙的。煎一個荷包蛋，比了接一個難產的生，還要吃力。開一條鯽魚的肚皮，比了開一個人的肚皮，還要艱難。她只得仍舊去陪著何家姊妹和老阿爹，一同去闊談去了。談到了她們要尋覓廠址的問題，朱村長說：『地址是有的，自然要水隆交通便利的地方，吃過中飯，我們到那裹去看看。現在所有室地，都歸村有，誰要開廠的，尅向村中租借。和借的期限，二十年也好，三十年也好。大概普通是二十年，因為現在世界進步很快，徒前中國書上說：三十年為一世，」此刻三十年，便有大大的變遲了。進來到我們這裹自由村來相度地址，預備開工廠的很多。不過我們也很為慎重，有的可以答應，有的卻不能答應呢。』　（一一二）</p>

<p>— 雪影</p>
<p>香港亦將排演該劇　均為救亡日報籌款</p>
<p>「一年間」是夏衍新寫的四幕劇，這個戲是為金山王瑩等出國為第五集團軍募集傷兵工場等款而寫的。夏衍先生主持救亡日報，原已很忙，但爲了此事重大，金山等又愁沒有新的可演的劇本，一再情商催促，才忙裹偷閑趕寫了出來。</p>
<p>戲雖是忙裹偷閑趕出來的，可是「一年間」之為桀出的新寫實主義的劇本卻還是眾口一致承認的。戲裹沒有一隻公式的救亡面孔，可是卻揚溢著濃厚的對於抗戰勝利的自信和樂觀的氣氛，人物性格的刻畫和結束的聰明有動，更是使這部戲成為桀作的一大理由。預料這部戲在美國上演的時候，識美國人民更明瞭於中國的堅強不可屈服，將是毫無問題的。</p>
<p>卻說這部戲除金山王瑩等在美國演出之外，在重慶，資金也在國泰大戲院演過，配上堂堂之陳，生意好得不得了，榮譽座的票價是每席五十元，然而結果還是客滿，甚至連玻璃窗也給擠碎，管理前臺的王晉笙穿了他的上校制服，結果也依然不能把秩序維持得整然有序。</p>
<p>這次公演是為救亡日報募款的，結算下來盈餘了七千餘元。演出陳容，彈硬之至：導演是應蕓衛；演員趙丹飾那個堅強正義的老者劉愛虞，白楊飾新娘，舒秀文飾姑母綉笙，王為一飾失敗注意者明揚，英茵飾一個住亭子間的救亡份子喻志華，其他角色，如德方，阿澎等等，也均一時之選，這祗要看白楊祗飾一個戲不多的新嫁娘便可以看出來。至於戲的背景，則第一二幕是在沿滬杭路的某小站，第三四幕則是渝陷後的上海。</p>
<p>重慶之外，最近得到消息，聽說在香港也正有人在預備把它演出，所得之款，也將捐給救亡日報。（義賣獻金）</p>

<h3 id="c143">關於劉寳全 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 迂堂</p>
<p>假如說中國音樂在世界樂壇佔有地位的話，那無疑的劉寳全應該是天才音樂家之一。因爲他所唱的大鼓所應用的音律，已完全包括平均十二律，（即每「均」之內分爲十二平均的半音）與近代西洋音樂所採用之平均音律完全吻合，這是其他一切中國音樂所沒有的。而他以一人的歌喉，極巧妙的運用十二音律，在演唱某一故事時，兼作叙事，描寫，平章，抒情，插科之用，同時復以眼神，手法。，甚至內心表演出故事中各個不同人物的神情，對白。，不同事物的布局動態；這種把自己連聽衆整個地溶化在音樂和故事之中的神技，也是古今中外所無，而是這位大藝人所獨創的。</p>
<p>幾齣熟悉的大鼓，如寗武關，長板坡，華容道，遊武廟，烏龍院，鬧江州，馬鞍山，每齣都有他獨特的風格，和簡進美妙得無法形容的技術。就意識方面講，寗武關可說是他藝術的最高峯表現了。在這齣戲裹你可以聽這位老藝人怎樣在三根絲絃的襯托中，表說明末闖賊作亂，大將周遇吉敗陣失地，探母祝壽，强言歡笑，賢母窺破隱情，責以大義，別母從征，姣妻自經，愛兒撞斃，賢母自焚，義僕投火，周遇吉血戰闖賊，亂箭身亡，這段兼有忠臣，孝子，義僕，節婦的驚天地泣鬼紳的偉大民族故事。當他表演到故事中每一個人的神情，以及母子夫婦父子主僕之間的種種悲壯淋漓的情緒時，闔坐的人，沒有不深受感動，掩面泣下的；而台上的他，心眼身手，渾身上下，簡直無一處不合戲情，無一字不合節拍。他的歌譜，把音節細分到甚至十六分之一，他運用他那五音俱全，剛柔兼備的美妙歌喉，從這個音律很自然的滑到那個音律，同時有意無意的玩弄着那些繁複得驚人的音節，（在舊劇中稱爲耍板，然繁簡判若霄壤，）要不是，深受訓練的音樂家，簡直無法辨認出些音律所指，音節所在，藝術至此，已臻化境。</p>
<p>劉寳全這次登台的第二天，他向着台下感慨地說：「我來上海，第一决遠在十數年前，地點在新世界，第二决是三年前，地點在大中華，這是第三决，要說下一决呀，像我這樣歲數，怕是不能的了！」他說完這話，台下雖然齊聲報以會心的微笑，不過我想大多數人，一定和我一樣，在笑完之後，會感到一陣心酸。</p>
<p>劉寳全被稱爲敱王，再確常也沒有，因爲大鼓雖非他所始創，可是大鼓按這樣唱法，的確是他所首創的。每一藝術，惟有創造者，乃能空前，亦惟有創造者，乃能絕後，所以我和一切愛好他的藝術朋友，都稱許他爲空前絕後的尤音樂家。我國人之所以不重視他，因爲他們不曾聽過他的絕藝，他之所以未被世界重視，因爲他還未被世界所發現。我對於這位七十一歲的老藝人，爲了幾乎僅够開支的包銀，老遠的打北國來到孤島，在一個小型劇塲，每天僅僅擁有數百知昔，（事實上還有不少僅爲趕然鬧而非眞眞欣賞他藝術的，）感到異常凄楚。一月易過，迄位老音樂家，轉瞬又要回到已經淪陷的古城去了，我雖在這裹默祝他健康，可是一想到以後是吾能聽到這種盛世元昔，不覺萬分悵惘。</p>
<p>劉寳全的大鼓，以前雖然收了不少唱片，不過我認爲唱片是不够的。爲了要保存劉寳全的藝術—這些國寳，傳之後世，非要把他攝入鏡頭，製成電影不可。因爲他的唱，不過是他藝術的三分之一，還有三分之一，是眼神手法，也非攝入不可，其餘三分之一，則是內心表演，這是無法保存的了。我這裏希望電影製片商，容納我的請求，趁他老人家還未北返之前，完成此項偉業，我以爲即使爲了攝製是項影片，化費很大的代價，也是値得的。因爲這些攝成的影片，無異是傳國之貿，在不久的將來，是要價値連城的。</p>

<p>— 璐</p>
<p>說起郝小雲，也許有人要問，以爲她是一顆新進的童星；其賞她開始拍戲，遠在五年以前，早期的「大家庭」「紅運高照」和「自燕女郎」等，部有她的演出；不過都不佔重要的地位，有時差不多只露一露臉，連講話的機會也沒有，致被觀衆們所忽視了。他原名呌根雲，八歲時就開始拍戲，所以影圈裹的人，都呌她郝寳寳。她今年繼十一足歲，在尙賢堂小學校唸書，爹爹是北平人，會演戲，她得她父親的薰陶，講得一口流俐的國語；她會唱歌，也善舞蹈，更懂得皮簧，唱得好戲，據說打鼓　曹還是她的拿手。她的面龐像胡蝶，不過沒有酒渦，脫不了童年的稺氣，以前某電影雜誌曾刊過她的相片，並譽她是中國的秀蘭鄧波兒，論相貌，可算是中國童星的行列裏較美麗的一個了！</p>
<p>我以爲一個電影從業員的成功，一半固要靠自己的天才與努力，而一半也需要有人來識拔她。以小雲在此片的演出而言，無疑的更大的成功，就擺在她的面前，因爲以一個不被影壇及觀衆所重視的童星，一旦祖任起這重要的角色，而給予觀衆以不壞的印象，不得不使我們驚異的。所以我希望導演們，對於天才的童星，予以多多的開導和發掘，也許她們會給孤島的影壇，開上一朶美麗的奇葩呢！</p>

<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>大李五好惡作劇</p>
<p>大李五的惡作劇，實在是筆不勝述，最使人捧腹的就是戲弄某小生一事，據說有一回某鬚生唱「轅門斬子」，某小生去楊宗保，而飾八千歲的就是大李五，等到宗保犯了臨陣招親的罪名，被他父帥傳令推出轅門問斬的時候，一個人坐在台口的椅子上，兩手倒剪（即雙手反背過去，作出被縛的樣子。）不能動轉，這時候焦二爺（贊）搬請八賢王到來，原想他們元帥能將人情准下，饒恕了宗保的性命。不料白虎堂上楊趙二人頂了半天嘴，還是不赦，八千歲無法可想，才走到宗保跟前撫慰他一番。誰知大李五在上塲以前，避地裹先用些糖汁抹在掌心裏，這時他趁着撫摩悲泣的當兒，就將糖汁塗在宗保的臉上，那時正當暑熱天氣，舊日的茶園裹又不考究衛生，馬上一羣蒼蠅就都聚集在某小生的臉上，直把某小生釘得不痛不癢，難過異常，雖說他雙手並不會眞被綁純，但是依照唱戲的規短，無論如何是不得自行鬆綁的。坐在前台看戲的人，但見他擠眉咧嘴，搖頭幌腦，作出種種怪狀來，實在不明白究竟是怎麼回事兄，引得哄堂大笑。後來穆桂英出塲，與楊六郎對唱了半天，台下仍舊是大笑不止，去六郎及穆桂英的弄得莫明其妙，還當是自己出了什麽毛病，兩個人手足失措，幾乎不能終塲，直到桂英來替宗保鬆綁才知道個所以然來，大李五這人眞是缺德透啦</p>
<p>義伶羅葵舫生前有兩事足述</p>
<p>已故譚派鬚生羅小寳，字葵舫，論起他的嗓音，的確是雲遮月的味兄。可惜他因家庭環境太壞，夫人又是一位不賢慧的婦人，常常與他吵鬧，後來竟氣成個羊癎瘋的毛病。因此他就不敢過於勞動，在滬出演時，祇是拿些偏於唱工如「捉放」「武家坡」「空城計」「罵曹」「汾河灣」「碰碑」「探母」等這一類的譚派戲來敷衍觀衆。其實他所擅戲劇之　，雖不敢與叔岩相較，然而總比又宸小培等還要高出十倍。「定軍山」「珠簾寨」這類靠把戲，他無不能演，並且演來還眞邊式，不過就是壞在他那種不爭氣的毛病上，遂致對於以上諸劇竟不敢問鼎了。（一三）</p>

<h3 id="e1">After the Chinese Army in Hubei Recaptured Yuekou, They Split into Two Routes to Drive the Japanese Army into Tianmen; Japanese Troops in the City Have Been Surrounded; One Route of the Chinese Army is in Tianmen; Chinese Army on the Hanyi Road Advanced to Qingshuitang, Fierce Battles Occurred; Japanese Troops Southwest of Tanghe Were Flanked and Attacked, Collapsing South Towards Cangtai <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Yichang) In the Hubei Central War Situation, after the Chinese army successively recaptured Wamiaoji and Yuekou, the two routes continued to pursue the Tianyue Road, completely driving the remaining Japanese troops into Tianmen. At the moment, the Chinese army has advanced to the city of Tianmen, surrounding the Japanese troops. The Chinese army on the Hanyi Road advanced to Qingshuitang, encountering the Japanese army, and fierce battles broke out, destroying seven or eight Japanese vehicles, killing dozens of Japanese soldiers, including an important Japanese commander, and seizing a large amount of spoils of war. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) In the Henan Southern area, since the Chinese army launched attacks, victories have been achieved one after another. On the 14th, the Japanese troops who fled from Tanghe, except for a small part who built fortifications in the Shangtunzhen Xiaoqinghe area to resist stubbornly, the majority fled to Huyangzhen, Qiyizhen, south of Tanghe, and other places. The senior Chinese military commander immediately ordered a pursuit of the victory and dispatched elite troops to attack the rear of the Japanese troops in Cangtai (southwest of Tanghe) in multiple directions. The artillery fire was fierce, and the Japanese troops felt increasingly unable to hold on. Finally, on the afternoon of the 15th, they fled towards Yangjiadang (more than ten li south of Cangtai). (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The situation in eastern Henan has become calm. Except for more than 3,000 Japanese troops from Bian who marched towards Chenliu on the 15th, and more than 1,000 Japanese troops on the opposite bank of Huayuankou who marched northeast on the morning of the 15th, there have been no other activities. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fancheng) More than 1,000 Japanese troops south of Tanghe, after being fiercely counterattacked by the Chinese army, collapsed southeast on the 15th, in a very disheveled state. The Japanese troops in Suixian, after a long battle, were scattered like fallen leaves in the wind and are now regrouping. After the Chinese army cut off the Jingzhong Hanyi Road, one route advanced towards Changshou Shop on the 16th, and another route recaptured Yuekou on the 15th and besieged Zaoshi on the 16th. The war situation has improved. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changde) Front-line telephone report: (1) A certain unit of the Chinese army in Hubei attacked the Japanese troops on the Yonglong River the night before last, has approached the area, and is currently besieging it. (2) The Japanese troops near Zao Sui were also fiercely attacked by the Chinese army, killing more than 60 Japanese soldiers. (16th dispatch) A Chinese military spokesperson stated that Jiyuan and Mengxian on the north bank of the Yellow River are currently in the hands of the Chinese army. These two places are military strongholds, and since the Japanese army has not occupied them, it will definitely not be able to cross the Yellow River. (16th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A Chinese military spokesperson claimed that the Japanese army's attempt to encircle the Chinese army in the mountainous area east of Xiangyang in northern Hubei has now failed. Fierce battles are currently underway. The situation is as chaotic as the war in Shanxi Province. The main line of defense between China and Japan in northern Hubei and southern Henan extends from Tongbai in the north, through Suixian, to the Dahong Mountains, and then turns to Zhongxiang. The Japanese army attempted flanking maneuvers, with its right wing launched from Tongbai towards the northwest, attempting to invade Tanghe in southern Henan. Its left wing advanced north from Zhongxiang, attempting to invade Xinye east of Xiangyang. It is learned that the Japanese army's left wing was formed by a brigade of cavalry, advancing north along the east bank of the Hanshui River. After reaching Xinye, it turned north to Tanghe to connect with the Japanese army's right wing. At the same time, a team from the Japanese army's left wing advanced east from Xinye to spy on Zaoyang. The Japanese army captured Tanghe on May 12. The Chinese army, based in Nanyang in southern Henan, urgently departed south, attacking the Japanese army in Tanghe, and recaptured Xinye on the 11th and Tanghe on the 14th. The Japanese army then retreated to a new position southeast of Tanghe. The Japanese army's right wing immediately dispatched reinforcements to Tanghe to assist in the battle. Fierce battles are underway there. At the same time, the Chinese army on the west bank of the Hanshui River crossed the river near Shayang, advancing east along the Hanyi Highway to pressure the rear of the Japanese army. The Chinese army is currently holding positions in the Dabie and Dahong Mountains. The Japanese army's artillery, mechanized units, and aircraft cannot exert much effect there. The Chinese army can rely on the mountainous terrain in northern Hubei for long-term defense, like the mountainous areas of Shanxi Province. The situation in Xiangyang has now eased, and there are no traces of the Japanese army on the west bank of the Hanshui River. (16th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chongqing dispatch: The Japanese army's decision to invade from central Hubei and southern Henan has been repeatedly blocked by the Chinese army in the past two weeks, suffering heavy losses. Currently, the Chinese army is continuing to engage in fierce battles with the Japanese army in the areas south of Tanghe, north of Suixian and Zaoyang, and north of Zhongxiang and Changshou Shop. (16th special dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanyang On the afternoon of the 15th at 4 p.m., after the Chinese army recovered Tanghe County, all administrative agencies have moved back to the city to work. The fleeing Japanese army is being pursued by the Chinese army. It is determined that more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers were killed, and many were captured. There are no changes in other areas.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to reports, more than 1,000 Japanese infantry, cavalry, and artillery soldiers stormed into Xinhui last night. Currently, the Chinese army is continuing to resist in the west of the city. The Japanese troops in Jiangmen have also increased to 4,000 to defend against a Chinese counterattack and are advancing along the Xinhe, Jiang, and Fo roads. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing Chinese attacking troops completely cleared out the Japanese troops near Tangxia on the 15th and are currently advancing towards Jiangmen along the Jiangfo Highway. The Japanese are relying on dangerous terrain to resist stubbornly and are using a part of their forces to invade Jinggen, where they were severely beaten by the Chinese army and immediately collapsed.

<p>Xingji On the 11th at dawn, more than 400 Japanese troops from Jingle, with four cannons, advanced southwest of the city in three routes. A certain unit of the Chinese army engaged in several hand-to-hand combats with them. After more than three hours, another unit of the Chinese army attacked from Xihe Village. Fighting until about 8 a.m., the Japanese army finally could not hold on and fled back to Jingle along the original route. It is estimated that more than 60 Japanese soldiers were killed, and the Chinese army suffered 34 casualties. A certain company commander made a heroic sacrifice. (16th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Shaanxi dispatch: The war situation in Shanxi is calm. Chinese guerrillas along the Tongpu and Zhengtai lines have recently been constantly launching attacks on the Japanese, achieving small victories repeatedly. The Japanese troops in Shandong are still guarding various transportation strongholds. Guerrilla warfare in various places has killed more than 1,000 Japanese soldiers in the past half month. The Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways are frequently damaged by the Chinese army. (17th morning special dispatch)</p>

<p>Jinhua At 10 p.m. on the 13th, a certain unit of the Chinese army attacked Liuliba, south of Jiashan. The Japanese army opened fire on the Chinese army upon hearing the news. The Chinese army advanced while lying prone. When they reached a suitable distance, they suddenly launched a surprise attack and annihilated all the Japanese troops. Afterwards, the Chinese army took advantage of the victory to launch a fierce attack on Sanliqiao and recaptured the area. Another unit of the Chinese army attacked Jiutongwan, firing fierce artillery fire at the city of Jiashan. Several fires were seen, and the Japanese did not dare to retaliate. In this battle, more than 50 Japanese soldiers were killed, a bridge in Liuliba was destroyed, and 800 rails, telegraph poles, and sleepers were destroyed. (16th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) This place received a Chinese dispatch today stating that Japanese planes flew to Fuzhou again yesterday morning to bomb the city. The commercial district of the city has been bombed repeatedly in the past two weeks and has been reduced to ashes. In addition, six Japanese bombers attacked Ji'an in southern Jiangxi yesterday morning, dropping bombs inside and outside the city walls. On the same day, another team of six Japanese planes bombed the outskirts of Guangchang in southern Jiangxi. (16th dispatch, Reuters)</p>

As of the 14th, 147 people have died. Several cases have also occurred in Guangzhou and Henan Island. The Japanese authorities are now stationing doctors in various parts of the city to inject people with preventive fluid. At the same time, the authorities in Shamian are also implementing this measure. (16th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<h3 id="e7">British Decide to Ignore Japanese Demands Regarding Gulangyu; Any Further Weakness Towards Japan Will Inevitably Affect the Future of Shanghai <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(London) London today received official information regarding the demands made by Japan on Gulangyu. The content is essentially the same as reported. If recognized, the Municipal Council of the area will clearly become a Japanese institution. Reuters learned that it is expected that the General Secretary of the Gulangyu Municipal Council will reply to the Japanese side, stating that the demands must be submitted to the treaty powers for consideration. Thereupon, the British government will inform the Japanese side that Britain cannot condone interference with the administration of Gulangyu. Influential members of the House of Commons are currently secretly urging the government to order British sailors to land on Gulangyu to show Britain's concern for the current dangerous situation. The issue is currently under consideration and may have to wait until the report of Admiral Noble, Commander-in-Chief of the British Fleet in China, is received before a decision is made. It is commonly said in London that the British cruiser Birmingham (9,000 tons) and the small warship Scout (9,005 tons) are currently docked in Xiamen. If Admiral Noble wishes to send troops to land, there are sufficient troops available for dispatch. The British government may ask Noble to remain stationed in Xiamen for several days. Foreign Secretary Halifax discussed the overall situation in Gulangyu with Foreign Secretary Butler yesterday for a long time. Reuters learned that there is no doubt that Britain will resolutely reject Japan's demands. It is believed that the United States will take the same stand as Britain. At the same time, various newspapers continue to report in detail on the developments in Gulangyu. The Manchester Guardian clearly pointed out that the position of Gulangyu is exactly the same as the position of the Shanghai International Settlement, and said, "Therefore, the Japanese military occupation of Gulangyu and its far-reaching demands are a test of the policies of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and France. If the three democracies show any weakness in dealing with it, it can be predicted that the Japanese side will use the same methods in Shanghai. If the Japanese side were to do this in Shanghai, it would inevitably lead to a major crisis. It would be better for the three countries to take a firm stand on the Gulangyu case at the moment to deter the future. For this reason, the United Kingdom and the United States have protested against Japan's actions and have sent their naval commanders-in-chief stationed in China to Xiamen, which is encouraging." The newspaper concluded, "As with all other issues in the Far East, the best hope lies in the unity of the United Kingdom and the United States to deal with the Japanese side with resolute action." (16th dispatch, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) Sir Robert Craigie, the British ambassador to Japan, has protested against the Japanese Navy's search and arrest of foreigners when they landed on Gulangyu a few days ago. It is reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita has agreed to conduct an investigation, but nothing else is known. (16th dispatch, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) Admiral Noble, Commander of the British Fleet in China, has been ordered to travel from Hong Kong to Gulangyu on the cruiser Birmingham to inspect the local situation, examine the Japanese authorities' treatment of British expatriates, and submit a report to the government.

<p>(Chongqing) The Executive Yuan held its 414th meeting on the 16th, attended by President Kong, Vice President Zhang, and officials from various ministries and commissions. Chairman Kong Xiangxi made the following resolutions on important cases: (1) The Ministry of Communications submitted a proposal to coordinate the training of transportation technical personnel, proposing to change the Highway Technical Personnel Training Institute, which was previously approved for establishment, into a Transportation Technical Personnel Training Institute. In addition to training highway technical personnel, it will also train telecommunications and railway technical personnel. A request was made to comply with the organizational outline of the Transportation Technical Personnel Training Institute. The decision was to submit it for review. (2) The Ministry of Economic Affairs submitted a proposal, jointly reviewed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications, regarding measures to curb inflation. It stated that Chongqing is where the government is located, prices are soaring, and it has recently been bombed by Japanese planes. The supply of daily necessities in the urban area is particularly lacking. In order to urgently alleviate the shortage of goods and achieve the practical effect of suppressing prices, it is proposed to establish a wholesale department for people's livelihood necessities to regulate supply and demand and achieve the practical effect of suppressing prices. The decision was that the Chongqing Municipal Government would subsidize the Chamber of Commerce to implement it. (3) The Executive Yuan Extraordinary Period Service Group Committee submitted a request to revise the organizational charter of the Service Group Committee for review. The decision was to pass the revision. Also, on personnel appointments and removals: (1) The Executive Yuan proposed the appointment of Zong Zewei as the Secretary-General of the Yunnan Provincial Provisional Council. The decision was passed. (16th dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e11">International Misunderstandings <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>This is extremely humorous, and moreover, it is not unique; recently, international affairs have frequently used the so-called misunderstandings to warn and urge each other on. Originally, misunderstandings in diplomatic language were often used to cover up mistakes, embellish falsehoods, shirk responsibility, and quell disputes, turning big problems into small ones, and small ones into nothing, tending towards passivity; but the misunderstandings that have been heard recently are of myriad forms, seeming to have a grand design, following after the misunderstanding. For example, on the 10th of this month, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, regarding the Anglo-Soviet negotiations, told the House of Commons that the Soviet Union seemed to have some misunderstandings; see the Reuters dispatch. Also, on the 11th of this month, Soviet diplomatic circles declared that they did not know where the so-called misunderstandings mentioned by the British Prime Minister came from; see the Havas dispatch. Also, on the 15th, British Foreign Secretary Butler, answering questions from members of the House of Commons regarding the future of Shanghai, said that the Japanese government must not lightly misunderstand this; see the Reuters dispatch. Mr. Chamberlain deliberately suspects others of misunderstandings, the Soviet side pretends not to know what the misunderstanding is, and Mr. Butler warns others not to misunderstand; the subtle overtones are all wonderful words in diplomatic language.</p>
<p>The above three matters, we do not want to interpret or explain on their behalf. However, in terms of general international misunderstandings, their ins and outs, causes and effects, often lead to vastly different outcomes; and genuine misunderstandings are often deeply disavowed by the parties involved; and genuine flaws are often disavowed by the parties involved as misunderstandings. To take recent events as an example; Britain has the most misunderstandings, and the possibility of causing misunderstandings to others is also particularly great. Mr. Chamberlain has the ambition to appease the European situation, and the sincerity to seek peace; but regarding the existence of limitless ambition in aggressor nations, whether international treaties are superior to waste paper, whether historical prestige can control the power of reality, how not using power is no different from having no power at all, whether verbal and written condemnations can achieve the practical effect of punishment, all of these, Mr. Chamberlain misunderstood before experiencing reality and suffering pain. The Munich Agreement ultimately became a dead letter, and Czechoslovakia ultimately could not escape subjugation, which is a notable example of sacrifice to misunderstanding. As for the ability of the League of Nations covenants to be implemented impartially, it was obstructed by Britain; thus, Britain treats the League of Nations like discarded shoes, and the League of Nations cherishes its own covenants, quite causing misunderstanding. Britain's national flag, envoys, and all kinds of treaty benefits have been subjected to repeated violations and indignities, and there is nothing that can be done; thus, whether there is a determination to maintain dignity causes misunderstanding. For unreasonable sophistry and unfulfilled promises, all can be tolerated; thus, Britain is not to be deceived or insulted, quite causing misunderstanding. Making repeated statements of stern justice, repeatedly showing the posture of swift action, but ultimately failing to follow up with concrete actions; thus, there is bluster and intimidation, quite causing misunderstanding. Following this extreme of misunderstanding, how could it not make people misunderstand that Britain has naval and land cannons, but no shells at all.</p>
<p>Considering Britain's frequent international encounters in recent years, it is fraught with difficulties, and its attitude towards international affairs is full of painstaking effort, which is indeed worthy of sympathy. Last September, the Munich affair was indeed a forced acceptance. If it had not been deceived, then in the intervening months, perhaps millions of lives and trillions of assets would have been destroyed; thus, the compromise at that time was not without merit to mankind. What cannot be definitively concluded is; if Austria and Czechoslovakia, their countries lost their independence, and their people lost their freedom; if the dark clouds over the global situation today do not rain, and the bread of various countries is diverted to military equipment; although the scourge of war is delayed, when it erupts in the future, it may be wider, more intense, and more tragic; all of these costs are incalculable, then those who created this situation cannot be hastily judged for their merits and demerits; and how can those who coped with it at the time be called perfect. Comparing Britain's improved attitude with the situation in the past; Britain has always expressed its abhorrence of aggression, but in fact aggression has run rampant; and advocating the organization of an anti-aggression group. Thus, the atmosphere changes; readily providing guarantees to Poland and Romania, the atmosphere changes again; overcoming all difficulties and pushing forward the enactment of the conscription implementation bill, the atmosphere changes again; lowering its status to appease Turkey, the atmosphere changes again; thus, the world recognizes that the international situation has indeed been slightly relieved of its danger due to the change in Britain's attitude. To put it another way, the danger of part or all of the international situation was cultivated by Britain's past attitude; and the various actions that are most likely to cause misunderstanding are certainly not the best response to the international situation. Where there is misunderstanding, evil follows; the lessons of the past are not far away, and the same mistakes can be repeated; how will the British authorities strive for practical results and actual actions to dispel misunderstandings in order to curb the evils caused by misunderstandings?</p>
<h3 id="e12">Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Denounces the Japanese Planes' Massacre of Civilians; Three Purposes of the Reckless Bombing; Ultimate Victory Belongs to China <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Today, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek denounced the Japanese planes' massacre of innocent Chinese civilians, and accused Japan of attempting to destroy the people's livelihoods and discourage the Chinese people's morale through this kind of terroristic action. Chiang also ridiculed the Japanese military strength. He predicted that China will gain the final victory. The Japanese military strength can now be seen from the strong resistance of China. At present, the Chinese army has led the Japanese army deep into the interior. China has reached a position to control the future situation of the war. He pointed out that the purpose of the Japanese planes engaging in reckless bombing is nothing more than three points: First, to threaten the Chinese people's spirit of resistance through continuous bombing, hoping that the Chinese people will kneel and surrender to them; Second, to cut off the lives of the Chinese people through fierce bombing, attempting to reduce production and affect the future of China's resistance; Third, to harm the tranquility of Chinese society and disrupt the order of the Chinese rear through concentrated bombing. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek also stated that the enemy holds these three purposes, and also deeply knows that the foundation of China's salvation lies entirely in the people. Therefore, if they want to destroy the Chinese nation, they must first cut off the Chinese people's lives. This is why their bombing and burning must choose areas densely populated by Chinese civilians. Not only is this true in Chongqing, but it is also true in other places. Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the Chinese people's morale has been invigorated and their spirit has been united, surpassing the past. The enemy sees this and believes that if they do not display their ferocity, their invasion plan will be exhausted, and a collapse will be imminent. Therefore, within half a month, they have been blindly bombing, which is inhumane. However, the Chinese people can still remain steadfast as usual, doing what they need to do. This spirit is enough to deprive the enemy of their courage and counteract their poisonous schemes. Chinese compatriots should know that the enemy's bombing in the future will definitely not be limited to one city or one municipality, and their purpose is to target Chinese cities and the entire nation. As for the government and military equipment, although they have been bombed repeatedly, the losses are minimal, because they have something to fear. This can be proven by the fact that they have not dared to carry out low-altitude bombing in Chinese military equipment areas in the past. On the contrary, all places in China without military equipment are subjected to their indiscriminate bombing at any time and anywhere, without any restraint. From this, we can know that if China cannot actively replenish its military power and resist to the end, it will inevitably lead to the surrender of the entire country, and it will soon be slaughtered and wait for death. I deeply believe that the Chinese nation will be able to remember this deep hatred and great enemy, until the enemy is annihilated and the Chinese martyrs are avenged and the humiliation is washed away. Chiang then sternly instructed the citizens who enter the countryside to strictly abide by the regulations set by the government. Those with skills should assist in the development of rural areas, and those who are educated should educate the children of farmers, helping each other, sharing joys and sorrows. Sending evacuees to the countryside is not a temporary escape plan, but also a way to establish a permanent career. The foundation of nation-building lies entirely in the vast countryside. Enriching the countryside and developing production is the way to lay the foundation of the country and enhance national strength. The second purpose of the enemy will inevitably be shattered due to the development of the Chinese countryside. Chiang then discussed the air defense plans of various cities, stating that the provincial governments should strive to build fire lanes and prepare sandbags and water storage to prevent unexpected needs. He also instructed the people to obey the government's orders and advised them to remain calm while ordering officials to strictly enforce orders to defeat the Japanese people's third purpose. Chiang also spoke of the overall war plan, stating that from now on, the offense and defense, taking and giving of the important towns in the occupied areas will be under our control. This is a rare occurrence since the ethnic wars of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. Looking back at the current state of the enemy, not only are they deeply mired in the quagmire and subjected to our repeated waist attacks, they are also trapped in our major encirclement. The dangerous and embarrassing state is something that outsiders cannot know even a fraction of. This is also a rare occurrence in the war history of ancient and modern China and foreign countries. Chiang also predicted that the final victory of the Sino-Japanese War must belong to China. The enemy prides themselves on their army, which has been trained for many years, but once they encounter the resistance of the Chinese army, their resistance and their record is only like this. The total strength of their air force is only two thousand planes, so what is there to be proud of? Therefore, even if the enemy planes have the strength, they can only attack the cities of China's two to three thousand counties, but they cannot destroy the villages of China's ninety million households. They can only kill and injure lives that are caught off guard, but they cannot shake the spirit of China's four hundred and fifty million compatriots who share the same hatred for the enemy. Recently, the military arsenals and chemical plants in Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka, Fukui, Chiba, and Chiba and other places in Japan have been determined to be continuously and systematically destroyed by their war-weary military and civilians, and they are reaping what they have sown. Finally, he listed the atrocities of the Japanese in the occupied areas, urging the people of the whole country to swear to avenge this hatred and to be of one heart and one mind to wash away the shame of the nation. According to Chiang's telegram, it was sent to the people of the whole country and officials of various provinces and cities. (16th dispatch, AP)</p>

<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull stated that Japan has responded to the recent protest by the US Ambassador to Japan, promising to instruct its pilots to act as cautiously as possible to avoid harming civilians. According to a spokesperson for the Japanese Foreign Ministry yesterday, the British, French, and American Ambassadors to Japan have made representations to the Japanese government regarding the bombing of Chongqing, but stated that these were not protests in nature. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Butler, stated in the House of Commons today in response to a question from Labour MP Henderson that British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has made strong representations to the Japanese government, urging them, from a humanitarian perspective and for their own best interests, to strictly limit aerial attacks to recognized military targets. Henderson asked if the British government would, in order to bring the world's attention to the war method of massacring civilians, consider jointly approaching Japan with other governments to prevent future air raids like those carried out on Chongqing. Butler replied that Craigie, when making representations to the Japanese government, had mentioned that almost all of those killed and injured in Chongqing were civilians. To the best of Foreign Secretary Halifax's knowledge, other countries' ambassadors to Japan had also made similar representations to the Japanese government. Butler also stated that the detailed circumstances of the Japanese aircraft bombing of Chongqing are not yet fully known, but the British Ambassador has reported that the air raids on May 3rd and 4th resulted in 1,600 civilian deaths and an equal number of injuries. However, the total number of deaths may be higher when the excavation is completed. Fuzhou was subjected to air raids on April 25th and 28th, resulting in 180 deaths. There was slight damage to British property. Yichang was bombed by Japanese aircraft on May 8th, destroying 40 houses and killing 40 people. Henderson asked if the League of Nations Administrative Council could consider this matter and pass a resolution similar to the one passed by the League of Nations General Assembly last September. Butler replied that such an event could be considered, but it would require an initiative containing this intent. Labour MP Sorensen asked if a response had been received from the Japanese government. Butler stated that no response had been received regarding this matter. Conservative MP Boothby asked if special arrangements had been made to ensure the safety of the British Embassy in Chongqing. Butler replied that the British Ambassador to Japan had mentioned to the Japanese government that the British Embassy had almost been hit. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the matter of Japanese aircraft recklessly bombing unarmed Chinese civilians, the United States previously protested to Japan. In responding to the American protest, Japan promised the United States that it would again warn its air force in China to make every effort to avoid harming Chinese civilians and other non-combatants in China. The news about the Japanese response to the American protest made last Saturday and Sunday was announced by Secretary of State Hull. The American protest was made by US Ambassador to Tokyo, Grew, objecting to the bombing of cities such as Chongqing and Ningbo, as these cities are undefended. According to a report from Tokyo yesterday, Japan, based on the position that the aforementioned cities are indeed protected by Chinese anti-aircraft guns, will reject the American protest, holding the Chinese government responsible for the bombing of civilians and foreign property, as the Chinese government should keep its defense fortifications away from areas where civilians and foreign property are located to avoid being bombed. Furthermore, according to reports from Shanghai yesterday, a Japanese Navy spokesperson refused to comment on the American protest, as he "had not heard of it." This answer has made observers here feel perplexed. On the other hand, Hull announced that Tokyo has instructed Japanese forces in China to be extra cautious during air raids. Japanese aircraft are still continuing to bomb the cities mentioned in the American protest, with Ningbo being the most frequent target. (Associated Press, 16th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) A spokesperson for the National Relief Committee told reporters this afternoon that Japanese aircraft bombed Chongqing on May 3rd, 4th, and 11th, resulting in 10,000 deaths. On the 12th, the north bank of the Jialing River was bombed, killing 30 and injuring 51. The government has set up seven refugee camps to provide food and shelter. In the future, it plans to move the refugees inland to reclaim wasteland, providing them with land and loans. It is expected that the refugees reclaiming wasteland will be self-sufficient within three months. The government has allocated 1 million yuan to handle this matter, and if necessary, this funding can be increased to 3 million yuan. The Japanese aircraft bombings were definitely not directed at military installations or anti-aircraft gun positions. Such atrocities will not weaken the determination of the Chinese people to resist Japan or make them succumb. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3 id="e16">Differences in Opinions Between Britain and the Soviet Union on Forming an Anti-Aggression Bloc; Stalemate Not Difficult to Break; Soviets Still Insist on a Tripartite Alliance; French Authorities Willing to Mediate; Hoping for a Compromise Solution <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the formation of an anti-aggression bloc, the Soviet government recently sent a reply to Britain today. According to Soviet officials here, the content of this reply is critical of the British counter-proposal, stating that it lacks a reciprocal nature and insisting on the original position that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should first conclude a mutual assistance agreement. Only after this agreement is established can further discussions be held on other issues. In other words, in accordance with current British policy and taking into account the Soviet Union's concern for the security of the Baltic states, ways to protect small countries can be discussed. The British counter-proposal did not explain whether the Soviet Union would be guaranteed protection in the event of a future attack, which the Soviet Union cannot agree to. British officials, however, do not yet know the content of the Soviet reply, as it is being translated by Foreign Office staff. They only stated that if the Soviet position is as stated, then the British and French governments should hold talks to discuss how to respond. At that time, either the French proposal (which is closer to the Soviet position) could be used as the basis for continued negotiations with the Soviet Union, or the existing mutual assistance agreements between Turkey and the Soviet Union could be used to find a way for the Soviet Union to participate in the anti-aggression front. (Havas, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) The Soviet Union's reply to Britain's counter-proposal regarding Eastern European security arrangements has recently been delivered to London and is currently being translated. It will be studied today by Foreign Secretary Halifax and Foreign Office experts and is expected to be submitted to the Cabinet on Wednesday. The content of the reply is currently being kept absolutely secret by British officials, but it is rumored that the Soviet reply considers the British proposal unsatisfactory because it is not far-reaching enough. In addition to leaving a gap between Poland and Finland and disregarding border countries, it does not provide indirect guarantees for Soviet territory. Since Britain has not taken into account the possibility of a direct attack on Soviet territory, the reply urges the conclusion of a public mutual assistance agreement, which would not only guarantee national territory, but also include all direct or indirect attacks on the territory of the signatory countries. While the Soviet reply had not yet arrived, Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons in response to a question about the progress of British-Soviet negotiations that his side was awaiting the Soviet reply and therefore could not make a more detailed statement than before. Foreign Secretary Halifax hopes to have the opportunity to meet with Soviet representatives in Geneva. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that the British government will telegraph its reply to the Soviet Union's recent note to Moscow before the League of Nations Administrative Council meets in Geneva. The British government is currently carefully studying the Soviet proposals. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax is scheduled to travel to Paris on the 20th of this month to discuss the progress of current British-Soviet negotiations with French Premier Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet. It is rumored that the French authorities will propose a compromise plan at that time, advocating (1) that the Soviet Union should also guarantee all of the Soviet Union's neighboring countries that are guaranteed by Britain and France, and (2) that if the Soviet Union joins the war due to its obligations to the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia, which have not been guaranteed by Britain and France, then Britain and France should provide assistance. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) The newspapers continue to comment on the issue of forming an anti-aggression bloc today, all stating that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should compromise as soon as possible. They also stated that although the Soviet government's reply yesterday still insisted that Britain, France, and the Soviet Union should conclude an alliance treaty, it should not be difficult to find a practical solution when the foreign ministers of the three countries meet in Geneva on the 22nd of this month. The Daily Telegraph and The Times both stated that France and the Soviet Union had already concluded a mutual assistance agreement, so it would be possible to find a way to reconcile the differing proposals of the three countries. The Daily Mail stated, "Although British-Soviet diplomatic negotiations are at a standstill, it is rumored that the French authorities have proposed a different suggestion, which is sufficient to find a suitable solution to the current negotiations." In addition, the newspapers also stated that the main obstacle to the current negotiations is that Poland and Romania are unwilling to accept Soviet aid. In fact, this difficulty has already been resolved in practice. The Daily Telegraph reported, "Since German leader Hitler's speech in the Reichstag on the 28th of last month, Poland's attitude has undergone a real change, and it no longer firmly refuses to accept Soviet aid." (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union have recently been commented on by various newspapers, all stating that the Soviet Union's proposal for Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to conclude an alliance treaty has a greater chance of being accepted by Britain than it did several weeks ago. It is gratifying that British public opinion has changed. Le Parisien stated that, according to people in the lobby of the British House of Commons, public opinion in that country is more favorable to the Soviet viewpoint than before. Le Figaro stated that "Before the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union meet in Geneva, the British government will definitely propose a new plan to the Soviet Union as a basis for negotiations. Also, its mutual assistance agreement with Turkey can make it easier for Britain and the Soviet Union to approach each other." Le Matin stated, "It is rumored that the French government has long planned a plan to compromise between the British and Soviet positions. If future negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union still fail to reach a compromise, then the only way to break the deadlock is for France to mediate." L'Intransigeant stated, "According to news from London last night, negotiations between Britain and the Soviet Union are being personally presided over by Foreign Secretary Halifax, and he is prepared to accept it if the Soviet Union insists on concluding a tripartite alliance treaty."

<p>(London) Government party and opposition party parliamentarians in the House of Commons yesterday raised supplementary questions, all expressing hope that the British-Soviet talks would be concluded quickly. The Prime Minister replied that although Poland and Romania had not made a formal statement on their attitude towards these negotiations, it was already well known to the British government. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin recently visited the capitals of Poland and Romania, and has already had the opportunity to exchange views with the two governments, so it is not yet convenient for him to announce the attitude of the two countries. A certain parliamentarian then asked Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler what obligations the British government had to Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, and whether Britain would support the Soviet Union if it was drawn into war to defend these countries against aggression. Butler replied that apart from any obligations that the British government may have to these countries as members of the League of Nations, it has no other obligations. Regarding the progress of British-Soviet talks, the Prime Minister has already spoken about it, and he could not add anything. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The newspapers in Tokyo today unanimously declared that the British-Soviet agreement is aimed at resisting anti-communist countries. The newspapers believe that Britain and the Soviet Union will soon conclude a mutual assistance agreement. The newspapers pointed out that Japan is paying close attention to any steps taken by the Soviet Union. The Asahi Shimbun declared, "Foreign Minister Arita said in his speech on May 8th that Japan cannot ignore cooperation between Britain and the Soviet Union in the Far East or Europe. Based on past experience, Japan believes that it is essential to strengthen the Anti-Comintern Pact. The conclusion of the British-Turkish agreement is also an expression of Britain's encirclement of the Axis powers. Although Japan is neither a democratic country nor an omnipotent country, its attitude should be based on the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact." (Haitong, 16th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Foreign observers here recently declared that the Rome-Berlin Axis has now encountered two major failures: one is that Britain and Turkey have agreed on a mutual assistance agreement, and the other is Poland's change of attitude. The German authorities often distort the European situation in order to deceive the people, but their explanations are often inconsistent with the facts. For example, it was previously rumored that it would not be difficult for Germany and the Soviet Union to get closer, which has now been proven to be inaccurate, as is one example. As for the various newspapers, their distortions of various facts are too numerous to mention. For example, when French Premier Daladier recently gave a speech, he said that France and Poland maintained a full alliance, but the German newspapers pointed to this as "a warning to Poland." They also said that the mutual assistance agreement agreed upon by Britain and Turkey was aimed at the Soviet Union, and that Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Potemkin recently traveled from the Romanian capital to Warsaw because there was no other route between the Romanian capital and Moscow, not because of a dedicated visit. All of these explanations are one-sided fantasies, intended to cover up Berlin's unease. In addition, the Nazi Party's various publications stated on the eve of Italian Premier Mussolini's speech in Turin that the Anglo-Italian agreement of April 16th of last year should be declared invalid in response to the mutual assistance agreement agreed upon by Britain and Turkey. Who knew that the Italian Premier did not take this action, and his wording was more moderate, which greatly disappointed the Germans. The Hamburger Fremdenblatt also stated a few days ago, "The authorities in various countries that are promoting the encirclement policy now need a rest." In fact, this need is in the Axis countries, not in the various democracies. The Axis countries' diplomatic authorities had previously made repeated efforts to Japan and Spain, but apparently suffered setbacks due to those countries' cautious attitudes. In short, Germany, under the current circumstances, has no choice but to reconsider the European situation. Although the Danzig Free City issue is still as acute as ever, Germany may not act hastily and risk crisis. (Havas, 15th)</p>

Kissing a Japanese Woman in Broad Daylight Will Inevitably Be Punished. <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan implemented new regulations for foreign residents starting May 1. Some critics say that, according to these regulations, foreigners will not be able to live in Japan because the Japanese authorities often classify foreigners they do not welcome as violators of public morality. Many foreigners believe that the term "violating public morality" is too vague. Japanese police officers are unwilling to elaborate on this term, but briefly indicated its general meaning, saying that the so-called violation of public morality does not depend on the behavior itself, but on the circumstances. For example, if a foreigner seduces a Japanese woman, it is a private matter and will not be punished. However, if a foreigner kisses a Japanese woman publicly in the street in broad daylight, punishment is inevitable, but it will not lead to expulsion from Japan. If a foreigner kisses a woman in a dark alley at night, it is not a problem because it does not harm public morality. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

The island is located between Finland and Sweden, at the mouth of the Gulf of Bothnia, and is strategically important. In 1921, the League of Nations ruled that it belonged to Finland. In October of the same year, Finland signed a treaty with Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, the United Kingdom, France, Poland, Italy, and Latvia, promising not to fortify the island. In January of this year, the Finnish government, after obtaining the consent of the Swedish government, notified the other signatory countries, stating that the security system maintained by the League of Nations was weakening day by day, and Finland had no choice but to build fortifications on the island. Poland, France, Latvia, Estonia, and Denmark immediately agreed. The United Kingdom also expressed acceptance in principle. Only Germany and Italy stated that they valued the neutral status of the Åland Islands and would only allow the island to be fortified under certain conditions. (Havas, 15th)</p>

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Butler declared in the House of Commons today that the Spanish government had invited the British ambassador to attend the triumphal parade in Madrid on the 19th of this month, and the British ambassador had accepted the invitation. This statement caused Labor Party members to shout "Shameful!" and was ridiculed by Communist Party member Gallagher, who asked if the British government would consider giving Gibraltar to the Spanish government as a gift for its victory. Butler replied, refuting most of the members' supplementary questions, explaining that other appointed representatives stationed in Spain were also invited to participate in the parade, and that the acceptance of such invitations by foreign representatives was in accordance with international practice. Subsequently, Labor Party member Davidson attempted to propose a motion to adjourn the meeting, but the Speaker rejected the motion, stating that it was not a matter of urgency. (Reuters, 15th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Virginio Gayda, editor of the "Italian News," published an article in the newspaper yesterday entitled "War and Peace," clarifying the political background of Mussolini's speech. It stated, "The current world situation cannot be said to be peaceful. Italy desires peace and believes that peace is possible, but the current situation makes people doubtful. To achieve peace, it is necessary to abide by the following three major principles: (1) respect the needs related to the survival of countries and their national honor; (2) guarantee the independence and equality of the working classes of all countries; (3) countries should have their normal spheres of influence in the world to develop their industrial and commercial interests. International conflicts can also be said to be a class struggle between countries, arising from the unequal distribution of resources among countries." Although the idea of redistributing world resources has been widely discussed, there has been no actual action to date. For example, the recent speeches by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier did not mention the issue at all, nor did they intend to amend it, simply blaming others for aggression. It is certain that the distribution of resources will not be realized. The large amount of wealth they have accumulated did not come from legitimate means. Now they want to use force to oppose other countries' struggle for survival resources. This is enough to express their oppression and concealment of their true intentions. This is the ultimate goal of the containment policy implemented by Britain and France against Germany and Italy. (Haitong, 16th)</p>

<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Butler and others answered questions in the House of Commons yesterday regarding the China Incident, and they were almost overwhelmed. The questions included: (1) transportation convenience between Hankou and Shanghai; (2) anti-British propaganda in areas occupied by the Japanese army; (3) the Burma Road; (4) industrial development in the areas under the control of the Chinese government, etc.</p>
<p>Transportation Between Shanghai and Hankou.</p>
<p>Butler replied that British people who want to go between Shanghai and Hankou have not yet obtained normal convenience, and the United Kingdom is currently discussing this matter with the responsible Japanese authorities. Conservative Party member Major Milner stated that the restrictions on transportation on the Yangtze River have caused great distress to merchants and their families. He asked whether the government could continue to urge this matter and whether the government had discussed this matter with the commander of the British fleet stationed in China. Butler replied that the matter was still being discussed and that the government was well aware of the seriousness of the situation. The Under-Secretary of State replied regarding the question of anti-British propaganda in areas occupied by the Japanese army, stating that the British Consul-General in Shanghai had already contacted the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai about this matter at the beginning of last month. According to the report of the British Consul-General in Shanghai, the activities of this propaganda have decreased slightly compared to before, but the situation still needs to be watched, and if necessary, negotiations will be conducted with the Japanese side. Moorhead, a clerk of the Department of India and Burmese Affairs, answered the question about the</p>
<p>Yunnan-Burma Road</p>
<p>, stating that the funds used to improve the road are less than £28,000, and that no one other than Burma has donated funds for this road. A member asked whether serious consideration would be given to preventing unauthorized Chinese people from entering Burma. Moorhead replied that the government believed that the lasting consequences of this road were important.</p>
<p>Chinese Industry</p>
<p>Another member stated that although the Japanese army had occupied many cities in China, the Chinese government was still able to greatly increase the industrial potential within its controlled territory, and asked whether the British government had paid attention to this. Mr. Cross, a Secretary of the Board of Trade, who was present at the Congress, replied that the government had paid attention to this, and that the British government was now providing various appropriate assistance to any British merchants willing to cooperate in revitalizing China's development. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>British Ship Detained</p>
<p>Sir Milner, a Conservative Party member, inquired about the government's intention to take action regarding the detention of the British ship "Sagebrush No. 1" by the Japanese authorities, and asked the government authorities to issue a declaration. Foreign Under-Secretary Butler replied, "This matter has been raised with the Japanese government and we are now awaiting their reply." Lieutenant Colonel Flyntham, a member of the opposition Labor Party, continued to inquire, "Is this ship still under detention?" Butler replied, "Yes." Flyntham then asked, "Can the government not find a way to urge the Japanese authorities to release it?" The Foreign Under-Secretary replied, "It is currently under investigation."</p>
<p>Opium Atmosphere in West Shanghai</p>
<p>Sir Haslam, a Conservative Party member, raised a question stating that a Shanghai newspaper reported that British merchants had, on March 1, provided a list of 34 opium dens located outside the Public Concession where the authority of the Municipal Council did not extend, each of which had obtained a license from the Japanese authorities and paid 500 yuan in Chinese currency per month in dues. He asked whether the government authorities were aware of this matter and whether they had launched negotiations with the Japanese government, requesting that it immediately prohibit the sale of opium in the controlled areas. Foreign Under-Secretary Butler replied, "Foreign Secretary Halifax has received a report stating that as of March 1, there were 34 opium dens in the extra-settlement road area of the western district of Shanghai, that is, in the Japanese-controlled area, and that four more had been added since then. Each of these opium dens has obtained a license from the Opium Monopoly Bureau and pays approximately 500 yuan in dues per month. The matter should be raised with the Japanese government and is currently under consideration." (Havas, 15th)</p>

<h3 id="e47">Full Text of the Closing Address of the National Production Conference. <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The full text of President Chiang's address at the Production Conference is as follows: President, Vice President, distinguished guests. Today, agricultural, industrial, transportation, and economic experts from all over the country gather here to hold a production conference. I would like to take this opportunity to express my great hope. At present, there are two major tasks in the country: one is the war of resistance on the front lines, and the other is production in the rear. Today, production in the rear is doing the same sacred work as the soldiers fighting on the front lines. Without the bloodshed of the soldiers on the front lines, we cannot protect production in the rear. Without production in the rear, we cannot support the war of resistance on the front lines. Our production conference here is as important as a military conference. Since the start of the war of resistance, in addition to killing our compatriots, forcibly occupying our land, and burning our property, the enemy has also blockaded our seaports, plundered our resources, and bombed our cities in an attempt to destroy all our production undertakings. Under these difficult circumstances, our entrepreneurs have all done their best to support the government's war of resistance, fighting hard and supporting us with unwavering perseverance. This is the glory of our entrepreneurs. Many of you present here today have traveled far and wide to attend this conference. This patriotic spirit and spirit of self-improvement are truly commendable. At the same time, you all know that our material resources are not as good as the enemy's. We have a vast land and abundant resources. Why are our material resources not as good as the enemy's? Because although our material resources are limitless, they have not been subjected to human creation. In other words, it is because our wealth is buried in the ground that our material resources are not as good as others. It is because we have neglected production and unplanned production in the past that our material resources are not as good as others. Since we are not as good as others, we must train and build an army and establish our modern national defense military equipment. In terms of production, we must also adjust production, create and build production, and establish our modern national defense industry. During this production conference, I hope that you will carefully discuss and earnestly study, review the past, and plan for the future, and immediately adapt the discussed methods to the needs of the war of resistance and implement them effectively. This is the great significance and great task of this conference. I often say that economy, military, and education are the source of the country's three major vitalities and also the three major important policies of the country at present. The so-called modern country is an economically independent country and a country with modern production and armament. Our national crisis is multifaceted, but the fundamental reason lies in economic backwardness. You all know that the enemy's attack on our country has the ultimate goal of economic aggression. The enemy is now desperately carrying out economic aggression in North China. Although the enemy's poisonous scheme will never be realized, we must deeply recognize the enemy's hideous face. The submission of a nation's spirit is the beginning of national subjugation, and economic bankruptcy is the end of national subjugation. Today, we must mobilize our spirit and at the same time use the mobilization of our spirit to achieve the general mobilization of material resources. If we cannot do this simultaneously during the war of resistance, we cannot support the long-term war of resistance. Even if we win the war of resistance, if the national economy goes bankrupt, this country can still perish at any time. In the past few days, you have all witnessed the enemy's indiscriminate bombing of the urban area of Chongqing. This kind of senseless bombing and arson, of course, shows the enemy's despicable and shamelessness, but we must also recognize that the enemy is trying to use this to threaten our spirit and destroy our production. We are of course very sad and angry, but we should grit our teeth, step up our work, and overcome difficulties, and forge our spiritual weapons and build our material weapons in the blood and fire. We must not only drive out the enemy with a long-term bloody battle, but also establish a prosperous and strong new China based on the Three Principles of the People with long-term difficult management. Speaking of prosperity and strength, these are the two fundamental principles of establishing a country from ancient times to the present and at home and abroad. This is China's oldest principle of establishing a country, and it is also the world's newest principle of establishing a country. Unfortunately, many people still do not understand this. But we must keenly realize that only a prosperous and strong country can survive. In today's world, to be prosperous and strong, we must have sufficient food and sufficient troops. Today, the so-called sufficient food means developing production, and the so-called sufficient troops means training and building an army. We must have sufficient food and sufficient troops to carry out the long-term war of resistance and build a prosperous and strong country based on the Three Principles of the People. We must develop production to improve the people's lives and enable everyone to have ample food and clothing. We must develop production to protect the survival of the country. Modern warfare, whether in terms of equipment or supply, must rely on industry, so production is the central issue of the national economy and people's livelihood. Since our material resources are not as good as others, we must make up for the lack of material resources with spirit, and at the same time catch up and accelerate economic construction. Construction is the backing of the war of resistance and also the purpose of the war of resistance. The fundamental work of building a country based on the Three Principles of the People is production and construction. As Sun Yat-sen said, "The most important thing in construction is the people's livelihood," which means building a prosperous and strong country where the people's livelihood is secure. This is also the goal of the Kuomintang's revolution. Sun Yat-sen put forward a career plan 20 years ago. This great plan is still the fundamental policy of our economic construction today. At that time, Sun Yat-sen wanted to use international funds after the European War to develop China's industry. Although times have changed today and large-scale international investment may not be easy for a while, we must continue to work hard to attract foreign investment and at the same time do our best to build on our own. The National Economic Construction Movement that I proposed before is to promote the concerted efforts of all the people to use their own strength to develop production, exploit resources, and enrich the foundation of a modern country. The National Economic Construction Movement has been advocated for many years, but I must tell everyone that the National Economic Construction Movement is still far from being completed. This movement must continue. Today, during the war of resistance, we must make even greater efforts to quickly complete this movement. Regarding the National Economic Construction Movement during the war, I would like to put forward a few opinions for your reference. We must concentrate our manpower and resources, divide our work and cooperate, and march towards the grand goal of prosperity and strength. First, production must be disciplined. Today, whether entrepreneurs or workers, we are producing for the country and working for the country. The spirit of division of labor and cooperation is the basic principle of a career. Not only should there be absolute cooperation between labor and capital, but all the people, whether officials or entrepreneurs, whether technicians or the labor community, must advance in different ways and do their best under solemn self-awareness, and give full play to the spirit of cooperation and mutual assistance. At the same time, we must establish a spirit of discipline and a spirit of the rule of law in production undertakings, and thoroughly break the bad habits of favoritism, private control, monopoly, and perfunctory work. We must employ capable, talented, responsible, and hardworking solid elements, and establish a spirit of rapid, accurate, and capable pragmatism, a pure service spirit that is impartial, unpretentious, unhurried, and diligent. This spirit must penetrate into every state-owned or private enterprise, expressing a strict discipline and a good atmosphere. The above points can be summed up in eight characters: increase production and save consumption. This is the fundamental principle of the People's Livelihood during the war. We must enrich the military needs of the war of resistance based on these two major principles, establish..., and by advancing from this, we will be able to balance and rationalize public and private industries after the war, and achieve...national prosperity and...and fulfill the mission of building a country based on the Three Principles of the People. The glory of our country's future is already in sight, but for the success of all great undertakings, we must all make extraordinary efforts. We must drive out...the enemy and realize national prosperity. The two words... are diligence and frugality. Diligence and frugality are the inherent virtues of our nation and also the fundamental foundation of modern prosperity and strength. The ancients said, "The people's livelihood lies in movement, and movement does not lead to poverty." Movement means hard work. Whether entrepreneurs, the labor community, or technicians, we must not be afraid of difficulties, constantly strive, and constantly create. Movement also means hard work and frugality. The ancients said, "Those who produce are many, those who eat are few, those who do it quickly, and those who use it leisurely, then wealth will always be sufficient." A small number of us create wealth, and a large number of us share wealth. The use of the newest consumption with the oldest production is the root of national poverty and people's hardship and also the shame of our spirit. The country is in danger today because we have an unprecedented national crisis. During this war of survival, we must endure hardship beyond the ordinary to build a solid foundation for our descendants. Prosperity and strength are the goals of our ignorance. Diligence and frugality are the foundation of our spiritual mobilization. Spirit and matter complement each other and serve each other, so we can resist the war, build the country, and continue to move forward and complete the mission of building a great Three Principles of the People. I wish you all hard work and success. (15th dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e48">Director Kong's Opening Speech <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) (Continued from yesterday) From now on, regardless of public or private undertakings, their organization should strive for simplicity and rationality, commercialization, and popularization. It should not be tainted with the old bureaucratic habits of taking money and not doing anything, valuing empty talk over practical work. (2) The raising and allocation of production funds: Our country's production capital is inherently lacking. Furthermore, the situation during the war of resistance will be even more difficult. The supreme principle of national economic construction lies in self-reliance. Therefore, in addition to utilizing foreign capital as a last resort, we should strive to develop national capital on one hand and collect scattered private funds on the other, accumulating small amounts to make a large sum for our own use. We should pay close attention to things such as promoting rural cooperation and encouraging people to save. As for whether the allocation of production funds is reasonable, it is of utmost importance. The purpose of promoting production is to increase materials and strengthen the power of resistance. We must achieve greater production with the least amount of investment to comply with the methods of fund allocation. Whether it is appropriate, whether there are any corrupt practices, and whether we can further pursue economical methods should be reported in detail and carefully studied. The government advocates thrift, not only hoping to save on consumption, saving food, but also striving for economic rationality in production. It is hoped that everyone will pay close attention to this point. (3) Improvement of production methods: Striving for scientific and modern production methods is an immutable iron rule in the process of national construction. However, various production facilities before the war have either been damaged or are difficult to restore and apply for the time being due to traffic difficulties and lack of power equipment. Purchasing simple equipment will also not yield quick results in a short period of time. Therefore, we have no choice but to rely on existing production methods. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e49">Overview of Chinese Overseas Education: Overseas Study is Restricted During Wartime Exchange Controls. Overseas Research is Limited to Military, Engineering, Science and Medical Subjects. <a href="#e49" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c49" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">49</a></h3>
<p>Restricting and Aiding Overseas Study with Wartime Exchange Controls: In July of last year, the Ministry of Education formulated measures to restrict overseas study. The subjects of study for students abroad are temporarily limited to military, engineering, science, and medical subjects related to military defense and national defense, which are urgently needed at present. Qualification requirements are: (1) Graduates of public or private universities who have continued to research or serve for two years or more and have achieved results, or (2) Graduates of public or private vocational schools who have continued to research or serve for four years or more and have achieved results. Since the implementation of this measure, the number of students studying abroad has decreased significantly. Within half a year, only 59 public and private self-funded students have been approved to go abroad, which is insignificant compared to previous years.</p>
<p>After the announcement of the restrictive measures, those who were already studying abroad and had obtained overseas study certificates for more than three years were all required to return to China before September of last year. They were allowed to apply for purchasing foreign exchange for return travel expenses once. Those who did not return to China after the deadline would not be issued foreign exchange certificates. Those with special achievements who truly needed to continue research abroad, or whose studies were related to military, engineering, science, or medical subjects related to military defense, could be granted an extension with proof from the graduating school or the embassy abroad. Only those whose extension of study abroad has been approved may apply for purchasing foreign exchange for study expenses. Otherwise, only those applying to purchase travel expenses for returning home will be certified. Those who are willing to return home immediately, with certification from the embassy abroad, may apply to purchase three copies. The application should be reviewed by the embassy abroad, with added comments, and sent to the Ministry of Education for review, then forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for approval. From August of last year to January of this year, the number of students applying to purchase foreign exchange included 48 studying in the UK, 65 in the US, 96 in Germany, 80 in France, 13 in Belgium, 4 in Italy, 1 in Denmark, and 1 in Annam, totaling 208. Among them, 102 applied to purchase study expenses, and 106 were approved by the Ministry of Education to change their application to purchase travel expenses for returning home.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that many of the families of Chinese students studying abroad are in the war zone and should be given relief. Standards have been set. For publicly funded students whose affiliated provinces cannot continue to provide travel expenses, 700 yuan in national currency will be issued in advance as living expenses for three months. Those who have been studying abroad for more than three years will have the amount used as travel expenses for returning home, and will be ordered to return home. As for self-funded students with study abroad certificates, if their source of income is cut off, 600 yuan will be issued as living expenses for three months, or for travel expenses for returning home, but only once. Those whose studies are suitable for the country's urgent needs and who have achieved results in less than three years of study abroad may request relief. As of the end of January of this year, a total of 267 students have received this relief, with 150 receiving living expenses and 117 receiving travel expenses for returning home (49 in the UK, 78 in the US, 38 in France, 38 in Germany, 12 in Belgium, 4 in Italy, 2 in Switzerland, 1 in Denmark). In order to aid students returning from abroad, the Ministry of Education has included the planning of services for students returning from abroad as part of this year's higher education administrative plan, and has formulated measures for the registration of students returning from abroad during the war. Registration will be held from February of this year. Those who have graduated from specialized schools or above abroad, or those who have graduated from domestic universities and have studied in graduate schools abroad for more than one year, will be introduced to services within the scope of possibility, according to their specialized research, and will be assigned appropriate work and given living expenses. If they have not graduated from specialized schools or above in China before going abroad, and have not graduated from specialized schools or above abroad after going abroad, they may be enrolled in formal grades after passing the subject examination.</p>
<p>In the future, it is necessary to control foreign exchange and restrict overseas study. However, due to the limitations of equipment and teachers, university research institutes in our country have not been able to develop fully, so most of the specialized technical work and university teachers still have to be sourced from overseas study. Therefore, overseas study policies cannot be completely suspended. In the future, the Ministry of Education will strictly restrict new students from going abroad on one hand, and pay attention to cultivating talents needed for national defense construction on the other. The plan is roughly divided into several items: (1) Revising the provisional measures for restricting overseas study. During the period of resistance against Japan, publicly funded students who are not studying urgently needed subjects will be temporarily postponed from being sent abroad. Self-funded students, except those who meet the qualifications and regulations, study science within the approved list, and have obtained foreign scholarships or subsidies and do not need to purchase foreign exchange, will be temporarily postponed from going abroad. (2) Students who have been studying abroad for more than three years should be ordered to return home. Those whose families are in the war zone and have financial difficulties will be given travel expenses by the Ministry. Those who have special achievements and truly need to continue research abroad may apply for an extension of study abroad, but a quota should be set to show restrictions. (3) Establishing overseas study subsidy student positions, giving monthly subsidies. The standard for giving this student position is mainly based on excellent academic performance and financial difficulties, and will be handled by the Ministry's examination committee. (4) Reorganizing overseas study affairs, planning to set up overseas study affairs commissioners in Europe and the United States, or assigning staff from the embassies abroad to handle concurrently. The above items are urgently needed for restrictions. In the past, there was no effective management of students studying in Europe and the United States. In the future, specialists will be assigned to be in charge of their affairs, and students with excellent academic performance will be subsidized by the country. The overseas study system will be more thoroughly implemented and more effective than before. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e50">Characteristics of American Secondary Vocational Education: Thorough Guidance, Teachers Advance with Students, Facilities Based on Differences, No Mechanical Tendency: Mr. He Qingru's Investigation Report on Contents in Omaha City <a href="#e50" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c50" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">50</a></h3>
<p>He Qingru of the China Vocational Education Society recently went to the United States to lecture and investigate. The following is a record of the report. The boundary of secondary vocational education in the United States is not clear. Ordinary middle schools and vocational schools are mostly mixed. Very few vocational schools are exclusively set up. However, ordinary middle schools mostly set up vocational subjects to prepare those who cannot advance to higher education for employment. Therefore, vocational orientation is extremely important. The largest vocational subject setting in Omaha has about 3,600 students. The magnificence of the buildings and the completeness of the equipment need not be described in detail. Only the characteristics of its content are briefly listed, which may be a reference for vocational education in our country.</p>
<p>New Student Exploration: Students' ambitions are difficult to determine when they first enter middle school. If they must be divided into ordinary and vocational, it is inevitable that ordinary mistakes will be made. Moreover, there are many professions, and it is difficult to determine one when deciding on employment at the time of enrollment. The first-year (American middle school is still mostly a four-year system) curriculum of this school is mostly exploratory in nature. It is not necessary to choose a subject, nor is it necessary to distinguish between advancement and employment. In addition to required subjects such as English, social studies, and physical education, there are many elective subjects, all of which are experimental in nature to determine personal interests. After one year of testing, various subjects are selected according to personal interests and abilities. The school's guidance can also take effect here. The courses that can be selected in the first year are as follows: algebra, food, clothing, European history, ironwork, freehand drawing, elementary science, general factory work, French, Latin, mechanical drawing, printing, wireless, sheet metal, Spanish, woodworking.</p>
<p>Many Subjects: There are many professions available to middle school students, and students' interests are also very complicated. Although the school cannot train all professions in the society at the same time, it seems better to set up facilities for ordinary needs than to teach only one or two subjects. There are many basic trainings with subjects that are roughly the same. Therefore, the same facility is more institutionalized, and the subjects set up by the school are divided into three groups. The following are examples of subjects in each group: A. General and Commercial Group: Art, bookkeeping and accounting, food service (canteen and restaurant), clothing, music, printing, zero transmission technology. B. College Preparatory Group: Nursing Preparation, Engineering, Liberal Arts and Clerical. C. Industrial Group: Automobile Mechanics, Box and Kitchen Work, Carpentry, Drawing, Electrical Ironwork and Modeling, Machine Factory Work, Radio, Sheet Metal.</p>
<p>Flexible Subjects</p>
<p>At the end of the first year, students decide to enter a certain subject. Although there are required courses in each subject, such as those who study art must study freehand drawing, there is still room for elective courses. Those who are preparing to advance to higher education can also elect to study bookkeeping and typing in case they cannot advance to higher education, so they can have a skill. Students can modify their programs at any time during the four years in school according to the development of their interests and changes in the environment. The possibility of changing subjects in each subject does not mean that a person's school is a fixed path and there is no opportunity to change.</p>
<p>Thorough Guidance</p>
<p>Regarding students' career selection, subject selection and life problems, in addition to the school's general counselors who discuss and guide them at any time, every thirty students are guided by a class teacher. The class teacher advances with the students, so they have a deep understanding of the students' situation over the years. In addition, each year has a male and female teacher who are specifically responsible for guiding the curriculum issues of the current year. The principal is extremely concerned about the students and often talks to them individually. The relationship between the students and the school is like that between children and their families. Everything can be discussed. It is by no means dependent on the constraints of regulations, just to get things done.</p>
<p>Test Utilization</p>
<p>At the end of the first year, before students decide on their subjects, they all undergo various tests, such as intelligence tests, interest tests, and aptitude tests. The guidance of the counselors and the students' self-assessment all refer to the end of the tests, so the guidance is extremely scientific and the effectiveness is greatly increased.</p>
<p>Work-Study Cooperation</p>
<p>Advanced students in vocational subjects such as carpentry and food sales all adopt a work-study cooperation system. Classes are held in the morning, and practical work is done in the afternoon. Carpenters are engaged in building houses, and food sellers work in stores. The practical work is handled by the head teachers, who are responsible for contacting and introducing the head teachers of each subject, who have a set time every day to contact relevant factories, stores and institutions to understand the actual needs and to promote the school. At the same time, the connection between supply and demand can be realized, and the school and the society can be integrated into one. This method is extremely effective, and the responsibilities of teachers are also increased accordingly.</p>
<p>In short, American secondary education recognizes the individual's different facilities, is extremely flexible, and has a spirit of experimentation. It respects the individual's personality, emphasizes self-determination, emphasizes discussion, and emphasizes counseling. There is no tendency towards mechanization. Vocational education is a part of the entire education, not an independent department. The purpose of vocational education is to enable students to have the ability to start work. As for special and detailed training, it needs to be sought from city-level experience.</p>

<h3 id="e63">Five Chinese Arrested: The Municipal Council Disposes of it Appropriately, the Chairman of the Board Writes to the Consular Corps to Pay Attention, This Incident Has Obviously Broken the Agreement <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the case of five Chinese being arrested by Japanese military police at the Fulai Hotel on Guangxi Road on the 9th of this month, the Chairman of the Municipal Council has written to the Consular Corps, asking the Consular Corps to pay attention. The Chairman of the Board first stated that the entire power of the Municipal Council depends on the cooperation of the authorities of various countries and the Police Department of the Municipal Council, and will never infringe on the duties of the Police Department. He also stated that according to the recently concluded agreement, only the Police Department of the Municipal Council may independently exercise its powers within the Public Concession, and this incident has broken the above agreement. The Chairman of the Board continued, stating that the Police Department has never refused when the Japanese side has pointed out any terrorist activities and requested assistance in interrogation. The fact that the Japanese side carried out the arrest without notifying the Police Department in advance and without transferring the arrested persons to the Police Department afterwards should be brought to the attention of the Consular Corps.</p>
<p>Japanese Demand Not Answered</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that a Japanese spokesman claimed to reporters yesterday (the 15th) that the Hongkou Japanese authorities had not received a reply regarding the Japanese side's request to amend the Land Regulations to allow the Japanese side to have greater control over the Public Concession. As for the protests from various countries against the amendment of the Land Regulations, he had not officially been informed.</p>

<p>Moufu Returns to Shanghai</p>
<p>The Moufu vessel of the German Reiff and Co. conducted a trial voyage to Wenzhou on the morning of the 9th of this month. The vessel returned to Shanghai from Ou yesterday morning. According to the crew speaking to a reporter from the Daguan News Agency, the vessel was boarded by Japanese soldiers for inspection en route to Wenzhou, and was released after about an hour. There was no inspection when returning to Shanghai, and the situation along the way was very smooth. As for Wenzhou, after being bombed repeatedly by Japanese planes, most of the residents in the city voluntarily evacuated, and the market was quite deserted, but the local order has been restored and is as peaceful as ever. The vessel is scheduled to clear customs today, and plans to sail to Wenzhou tomorrow morning. In addition, the Debandent and Ende vessels of the Italian Sino-Italian Company sailed to Wenzhou at the same time yesterday morning.</p>

It is also learned that the vessel will return to Shanghai immediately, and will travel the Shanghai-Dinghai route regularly as a regular vessel from now on.</p>

<p>Damage Assessment</p>
<p>Ningbo was bombed for the eighth time on the 14th by Japanese aircraft. In addition to Dasha Mud Street and Xiaosha Mud Street, bombs also fell in Baishui Lane in the urban area (formerly known as Baishui Qingsong). The casualties have also been confirmed, with one civilian killed and five injured. A total of one hundred and four houses were destroyed.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Movements</p>
<p>The Japanese warships anchored in the Chuanshan waters outside Zhenhai Port sailed away on the 15th, and the situation along the coast is still stable. However, because Japanese warships are still anchored in the Daqushan waters and inspecting passing vessels, the schedules of shipping vessels are often delayed due to inspections.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council found that there were no restrictions on the loading of goods on public and private cargo trucks, which was very dangerous. Therefore, the license regulations have been revised and will be implemented from July 1.

<p>Shanghai is located on the west bank of the Huangpu River in the southeast of Jiangsu Province, where it meets the Wusong River. It is at the mouth of the Yangtze River, a major transportation hub between the north and south oceans and Europe and the United States, and the center of China's trade. At the beginning of the war, the center of trade shifted inland with finance, so Hong Kong in southern Guangdong replaced it and became an important hub for imports and exports in South China. All export commodity transactions were concentrated in Hong Kong, and the surge in import and export trade was rare in recent years. However, after the fall of Guangzhou, Hong Kong's trade suddenly shrank, and the center of trade returned to Shanghai. However, the import surplus has increased significantly. The following is a record of trade in Hong Kong and Shanghai from January to March this year:</p>
<p>Shanghai</p>
<p>January: Imports 40,162,838 yuan, exports 30,080,642 yuan. February: Imports 34,300,886 yuan, exports 29,172,584 yuan. March: Imports 54,444,523 yuan, exports 21,351,775 yuan. (The above are in national currency)</p>

<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, the Lianjiang Road was automatically destroyed. Goods transported from Shanghai and Hong Kong to southwestern China are concentrated in Haiphong. Therefore, the goods in the warehouses in Haiphong are extremely crowded. In addition, recently, it is the harvest season for agricultural products in Annam, and the supply of warehouses has become the most serious problem for transit goods. Taikoo and Jardine Matheson shipping companies because the Haiphong customs warehouse,</p>
<p>Almost No Space</p>
<p>They have already temporarily suspended the collection and transportation of transit goods to Haiphong. The remaining French Postboat Company and Far East Shipping Company are still reluctantly accepting cargo, but only limited to open-air warehouses. The supply and demand do not match, which is difficult to solve the problem. The relevant companies have repeatedly discussed the problem of cargo clearance between Shanghai and Hong Kong to</p>
<p>Remedial Measures</p>
<p>They consider it very difficult. Various transportation companies, customs brokers, and shipping companies have planned to build warehouses, but the guarantee issue for the customs in Haiphong is even more troublesome, resulting in a large invisible standstill in the transit of goods between Shanghai, Hong Kong and Haiphong. At the same time, after the Haiphong customs warehouse is full, not only the goods that arrive later, the shipping company</p>

<p>But also the goods that arrived earlier, are hard to take out and pay taxes even if they have a way to transport to Haiphong because the goods that arrived later piled up. Goods transported from Shanghai and Hong Kong to Haiphong in the past few days are all entering open-air warehouses. In this yellow plum season, the loss of goods is feared to be unavoidable. As for the warehouses built by the Xinsui Automobile Company and others in Haiphong, they have been approved by the customs authorities after repeated requests until recently.</p>

<p>The Yongjia County Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce regarding the issue of collecting public welfare fees from shipowners, saying, "Regarding the matter of collecting a public welfare fee of two yuan per net ton from imported shipowners by the Zhejiang Provincial Government, which is used for local funds, it has been officially notified that the shipowners themselves are responsible for it. According to reports from importers in various industries, the shipping companies all转xiang上海报关行转 Xiang Shanghai Customs Brokers, collect 20% under the item water freight, totaling four yuan per net ton, taking the opportunity to accumulate wealth, and public resentment is boiling. The shipowners intend to collect fees from the customs brokers in Shanghai, not from the importers in Wenzhou, and there is no conflict with the law. They do not know that the Shanghai customs brokers originally reported and transported goods on behalf of the Wenzhou importers, and the payment made on their behalf will of course be refunded in full. Now Wenzhou has telegraphed the provincial order to strictly prohibit it, but the shipowners are still collecting the fees. Please assist your association and immediately notify the Customs Broker Association to stop the payment in order to comply with the provincial order and avoid the Wenzhou merchants from suffering losses out of thin air."</p>

<p>More than 2,000 fresh meat shops and stalls in the city have been forced to shut down due to the illegal control and obstruction of sources by the "Livestock Market" organized by the Japanese puppets. On the 4th, in addition to ordering all shops to open as usual and strictly maintain order, the industry also sent three representatives with petitions to the French Concession authorities for help. The Director-General of the French Municipal Council, Faber, met with them and advised the representatives to inform their colleagues to resume business first. As for the dispute, they will then be forwarded to the higher authorities and wait for a reply. It is also heard that the Public Concession's Municipal Council will submit this case for discussion in a special meeting convened tomorrow (Thursday). Regarding the meat food of the various restaurants and food shops in Shanghai after the shutdown of the fresh meat industry, the authorities of the Health Department of the Municipal Council temporarily arranged to slaughter and distribute the pigs that were transported in. However, the industry unanimously refused to sell the pork that was slaughtered and transported into the concession by the puppet "market" in Hongkou, expressing their determination not to cooperate.</p>
<h3 id="e71">Strictly Prohibit Black Market Transactions; Rice Prices Have Stabilized Yesterday; Current Rice Stocks Total 550,000 Bags; The Food Supply for the Entire Shanghai City is Temporarily Not a Concern <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Due to the manipulation of hoarders in the bean and rice industry market, black market transactions have occurred. Rice shops have sent letters requesting prompt and effective measures to be taken to stop it. The Market Management Committee has now strictly implemented price limits and stopped black market transactions. The market situation has improved and rice prices are stabilizing. The food supply for the entire city is temporarily not a concern. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Rice Shops Send Letters; Stop Black Market</p>
<p>The Rice Shop Industry Association sent a letter to the Bean and Rice Industry Association yesterday, saying, "Recently, we have received reports from the rice shops in our association that the black market transactions in the market have reached 17 yuan, exceeding the price limit by 2 yuan, and the situation is very chaotic. The rice shop colleagues sell directly to supply the citizens, and for the sake of stabilizing people's hearts, if the rice price at the store exceeds the price limit, they will inevitably be criticized. If they fear losses and do not buy in, they will have no business to run after selling out, which is like giving up eating for fear of choking. If they purchase goods for the market, they will suffer too much loss and it will be difficult to maintain. We request that you promptly seek remedial measures, etc. We have checked that the statements of the colleagues in each industry are true. Fortunately, with your strong maintenance and efforts to limit the price, the market situation can be stabilized. Not only the common people have benefited greatly, but also the colleagues in our association are very grateful. However, in recent days, the rise has been more severe and the black market has reached 17 yuan. The Father Mong Gui Association has come forward to maintain it, showing that you have made great efforts to maintain the price limit. However, the chaotic market situation still exists. If strict sanctions are not added now, the future will be unimaginable. Therefore, we send this letter to you, hoping that you will quickly seek strict measures to stop black market transactions, warn the market, and strictly implement the price limit. This is our sincere request, and we hope to receive a reply."</p>
<p>Strict Implementation; Rice Prices Tend to Stabilize</p>
<p>After the Bean and Rice Industry Market Management Committee was ordered to strictly implement price limits and stop black market transactions, it stipulated that once discovered, the buyer, seller, and intermediary will each be punished, with each stone fined one yuan, with a minimum fine of 100 yuan. A second offense will be doubled, and a third offense will be doubled again. They also hope that anyone who reports will be given 30% of the fine as a reward. Since the implementation, although black market transactions in the mountain markets have not disappeared, the situation has indeed improved compared to before, and rice prices have gradually fallen back and stabilized. However, Zhong Jue rice is still at the top price of 15 yuan, and there are still no transactions for first-class white rice in the market. However, each market management committee hopes that the colleagues in the rice shop sales will not purchase rice that exceeds the price limit, because according to the law, they should also be included in the penalty, and the wind of black market is rampant.</p>
<p>The Food Supply for the Entire City is Not a Concern</p>
<p>According to the seventh survey released by the Rice Association, there are 553,248 bags of rice in the two concessions in Shanghai, which is enough for the Shanghai market for two months. Although the amount of rice transported from the producing areas to Shanghai every day has decreased sharply compared to before, this is a normal phenomenon during the time when the old harvest has ended and the new harvest has not yet begun, but the route has not been cut off, and the new rice will be available in just a few months. Therefore, the food supply for the entire Shanghai city is temporarily not a concern. As for the association's registration of rice owners with storage, because most hoarders are waiting and seeing and refuse to register, the results are negligible. According to the association, yesterday's registrants were: (1) Dacheng, Wushen 6,286 bags; (2) Shuntai, 5,905 bags, foreign rice 3,863 bags; (3) Yude, Wushen 4,027 bags, Changmi 196 bags; (4) Wanxingyu, Wushen 2,645 bags, Baigeng 154 bags, Baiwu 50 bags. In addition, this registration is scheduled to end tomorrow afternoon.</p>
<p>Doing Everything Possible; Open Up Sources</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency learned from rice industry groups yesterday that although the Bean and Rice Industry Association has suggested to the Concession authorities to order foreign rice, and the Rice Noodle Joint Management Committee is studying and considering it, the current order price is 20 yuan per bag, which is sure to lose money if it is transported to Shanghai for sale. Therefore, it may be difficult to achieve in reality. Therefore, to solve the food problem in the two concessions in Shanghai, it is best to find ways to open up sources. In addition to requesting the Concession authorities to provide assistance, rice industry groups have been working hard to open up domestic sources. Regarding the rumor of lifting the ban in Wuhu, according to its rice industry leader, Wuhu has not resumed issuing national rice removal certificates since it stopped issuing them. However, the old certificates that had been issued before are still valid after negotiations. Therefore, the rice transported from Wuhu to Shanghai recently is all due to the effectiveness of the old certificates. It is said that the rumor of lifting the ban is actually a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>After Mr. Gonis, the Western Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, resigned, the vacancy was filled by Mr. Greiner in accordance with Article 20 of the Land Regulations. Mr. Greiner has agreed to take office. Mr. Greiner also took over the positions of member of the Health, Public Works, Qualification, and Public Utilities Committees, which were held by Mr. Gonis.</p>

<p>The Nanhui guerrilla team, led by Yu Taosheng, now uses Datuan Town, 20 miles south of Nanyi City, as an important base. However, military institutions are located in the countryside, and only a few civil administration institutions are in the town. Because the local area is peaceful and the residents are concentrated, it still maintains its pre-war prosperity. Since last winter, the Japanese army has tried to invade the town with three-way troops, but all the attacks were repelled. At present, after the guerrillas have destroyed and blocked the water and land transportation routes, the defense is as solid as gold. According to a resident from the county who came to Shanghai yesterday, because the Japanese army could not successfully invade, they sent a bomber on the 14th to bomb and threaten the guerrillas. However, there is no confirmed detailed report yet.</p>
<h3 id="e74">"Huaxing Bank" Banknotes; Only for Use by Japanese Puppets; Will Circulate in Japanese-Controlled Areas; Suzhou Creek Unable to Accept <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The Dalu News reported that according to Chinese and Japanese sources last night (the 15th), the Huaxing Commercial Bank, a financial institution in Central China under the Nanjing "Reformed Government" under the wings of the Japanese army, will officially open in Shanghai this morning (the 16th). Although the organization of this bank was announced here on May 1, it has not yet engaged in routine financial business in this city. According to sources in the foreign financial community in this city last night, no agreement has been reached so far to accept the bank's banknotes south of Suzhou Creek.</p>
<p>Initially Announced</p>
<p>The bank's capital is 50 million yuan, with half supplied by the "Reformed Government" and half by six Japanese banks. The bank will issue banknotes and exchange them for legal tender at par to serve as reserves for the new puppet currency. The financial community here feels that most of the bank's banknotes will initially circulate in Japanese-controlled areas outside the foreign-managed areas, including Hongkou. However, according to</p>
<p>Local Business Circles</p>
<p>The opinion is that after the bank's local office officially starts, it will soon implement a control plan to restrict exports, which is similar to the current plan implemented in North China. This statement is widely circulated, but it could not be confirmed last night. It was previously rumored that Chen Jintao, the "Finance Minister" of the Nanjing regime, will serve as the "President" of the bank, and Washio Isoichi, the former president of the Manzhou Bank in Changchun, will serve as the "Vice President." Chinese sources said that when the bank's local office opens today, Shen Erchang will serve as the manager.</p>
<p>The English-language Great American Evening News reported that Washio Isoichi, Vice President of the Huaxing Commercial Bank, recently declared to Japanese reporters that the headquarters of the Huaxing Commercial Bank is located at 2 Duluo'an Road.</p>
<p>Opening Today</p>
<p>At the same time, the banknotes issued by the bank circulating in Shanghai are not intended to destroy the legal tender. In Huaxing Bank or any Japanese bank in Shanghai, the new currency can be exchanged for legal tender at par, and this new currency can also be used to "freely" purchase foreign exchange from Huaxing Bank. The bank will set up a branch in Nanjing around the 26th of this month.</p>

<p>More than 100 residents of Tiantong Road jointly submitted a petition to the United Association of Citizens in the First Special District yesterday, requesting a swift ban on the miscellaneous meat and vegetable stalls along the road, which obstruct traffic and harm hygiene, and earnestly requested the Public Works and Police departments of the Municipal Council to dispatch police officers to reiterate the ban, and strictly ordered the patrolmen to order the meat and vegetable stalls set up around Tiantong Road to move into the North Fujian Road Vegetable Market, and ordered the stall vendors around the public pit to move together. Violators will be punished according to the regulations in order to warn against imitators and safeguard public welfare and hygiene.</p>

<h3 id="e76">In the Home of a Naturalist - An Appreciation After Spending a Morning (Part 2) EL - Impressions from Visiting Mr. Arthur de Carle Sowerby <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Summary: Naturalist Mr. Arthur de Carle Sowerby is the current chairman of the North China Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. The day before yesterday morning, I visited him at his home, and Mr. George Ernest Morrison of the London Times was also present. Mr. Sowerby led us to see his collection of antiquities, the animal specimens he made himself, and his studio, study, etc. The following is a continuation from yesterday's article, depicting the scene after the three of us, along with four dogs, came down from upstairs. - Reporter</p>
<p>There was a room entirely decorated in the Javanese style. Inside, a female assistant was helping him organize manuscripts. The "tat-tat..." sound of the typewriter I heard before entering the room originated from there, and this was Mr. Sowerby's workspace.</p>
<p>We also looked at his collection of books, mostly about travels in the Far East, animals, and archaeology. His most prized possession was a bound compilation of the "China Journal of Science and Arts" from the past ten years. He said, "When he was the editor, he handled everything himself." He pointed to the dozens of thick volumes on the shelf, saying they were the crystallization of his hard work, like "every grain on the plate."</p>
<p>Mr. Sowerby's house was not particularly spacious. He utilized almost every available space, filling it with things. A cabinet made of dark fir wood stood solemnly and proudly in the gap at the turning of the staircase. The content inside, without asking, was known to be very substantial. He casually opened a bookshelf door for us to see, saying, "This section is all about zoology." He then pointed to a row of more than ten books and said, "These are specifically about dogs..." The several large Pekingese dogs, which always clung to their master's heels and refused to leave him, suddenly joined in the fun, raising their front paws and sniffing the spines of the books specifically about "dogs." Our laughter followed the sound of footsteps from above.</p>
<p>Before going downstairs, Mr. Sowerby also pulled out a natural history work by his ancestor from the bookshelf in his studio. Of course, he cherished this book very much. He solemnly said, "This is a handwritten work of his great-grandfather," and turned the pages, which contained very fine color illustrations. The colors were entirely applied by hand. After Mr. Sowerby's explanation, we realized that these color illustrations were first based on copperplate shadows, and then colored by his ancestor. No wonder he showed it to us so solemnly and carefully placed it back in its original place.</p>
<p>Downstairs, everyone sat in a very quiet environment. The green lawn in the garden, the elegant arrangement in the room, and the Eastern-style furnishings, everything gave people a feeling of peace and quiet. A strange thought suddenly occurred to me: if the many animal specimens that Mr. Sowerby had collected were to regain their lives and could jump, fly, and sing, what would this quiet house turn into? At least it would become a small-scale zoological garden, which is undoubtedly the case.</p>
<p>Mr. Sowerby invited us to sit under the window facing the garden, where there was a round rattan table and several armchairs. We sat down very comfortably. He also brought out beer to entertain us! At first, he asked if I wanted "tea," but I declined. So, everyone drank beer.</p>
<p>The three of us chatted casually around the round table, with nothing much to record. I will take this opportunity to introduce the life and experiences of our gracious host below:</p>
<p>Arthur de Carle Sowerby was born in 1885 in Taiyuan, Shanxi, China. He was the son of a British missionary. He first studied in Chefoo (present-day Yantai), and in 1899, he left China for England, later entering Bristol University. In 1904, he suddenly had the idea of traveling the world. He left England and wandered around. His only wish was to see the exotic flowers, plants, birds, and animals of various places. This was his hobby, and he had been dedicated to natural history since he was in university.</p>
<p>The end of this journey was Canada. He landed from "Winnipeg." At this time, everyone was migrating north, and he was also swept up in this massive tide to the "Saskatchewan" area. He lived a wandering life at this time, trying his hand at everything, such as farming, road construction, and odd jobs.</p>
<p>After being away from his birthplace for a long time, he suddenly had a homesick feeling. In 1905, he returned to Taiyuan. At that time, he did some work in the home of a missionary who loved animals and plants. His great work of building a museum was founded from this time onward.</p>
<p>Later, he taught at the "Anglo-Chinese College" in Tianjin for two years. After teaching, he decided to abandon the life of the "cold bench" and engage in the life of a naturalist he had "dreamed of" - traveling, hunting, and research.</p>
<p>I can say with certainty that if Mr. Sowerby had not been determined to become a practical naturalist at that time, then the house today would definitely be much emptier than it is now. Apart from a few so-called "rare" things that are displayed for display's sake, the home would never have been turned into half an antique shop and half a fur shop. Without being polite, he cultivated this research-oriented "stubbornness" from the age of twenty.</p>
<p>At the age of twenty-nine, he ran to the northern part of Shanxi, where there were many high mountains and forests. He engaged in hunting and specimen collection in places where no foreigners living in China had ever been. In 1907, he returned to the East China coast to establish a museum for the Tianjin "Anglo-Chinese College," where he had once served. This was his second construction work, like "Liu Ruan returning."</p>
<p>Having had two experiences in collecting natural history materials, the following year he joined the "Duke Peter of Bedford's East Asia and West Asia Expedition" to collect animal specimens for the Natural History Department of the British Museum. This expedition was led by the late Mr. Anderson and traveled from Shanxi and Shaanxi directly to the "Ordos" Desert.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned above that the sand hamster specimen that Mr. Sowerby obtained in this expedition was named after him because he discovered it. In the past, people regarded it as an honor to "attach themselves to a famous steed." Mr. Sowerby can be said to have "attached himself to a mouse," which can be regarded as a good story.</p>
<p>The second expedition lasted for a year - from the autumn of 1908 to the summer of 1909. Mr. Arthur de Carle Sowerby participated in the Gansu expedition of the American millionaire Mr. Clark. They collected many animal and plant specimens for the United States National Museum in Washington. After that, Mr. Sowerby specialized in collecting specimens everywhere and sending them to the aforementioned museum until 1917. During these many years, his footprints covered North China, East China, Northeast China, and Inner Mongolia.</p>
<h3 id="e77">The Fake "Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications" Actually Plans to Conduct Ship Registration, Attempting to Control and Manage and Increase Revenue, and All Foreign Shipowners Are Ignoring It <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The fake "Ministry of Communications of the Reformed Government" is attempting to seize the right to manage ships and is planning to implement control to increase revenue. Recently, it established a "Navigation Administration Bureau" in Shanghai, located at No. 55, North Sichuan Lane, North Sichuan Road. It is said that the director is a certain Zhou, who was originally a scum in the shipping industry. Recently, he has been sending notices to various shipping companies, trying to entice ships to go to the "Bureau" for registration and measurement. However, after the war, there are almost no Chinese-owned ships, and most of them have been sold to foreign merchants. Therefore, they have decided to ignore the "Bureau's" notices. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Fake "Bureau" Notifies Ships to Register</p>
<p>The fake "Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications of the Reformed Government" recently notified foreign shipping companies in this city, (details omitted) stating that the Bureau has been established in Shanghai and has begun operations. All ship owners and maritime operators should register with the Bureau and obtain certificates in accordance with the regulations, and pay attention to the following measures to protect their rights. The details are as follows: 1. For various maritime regulations, those that have not been re-formulated by the "Ministry of Communications" may use the regulations previously promulgated, as long as they do not conflict with the current "laws and regulations." 2. All ship owners must apply to the "Navigation Administration Bureau" for measurement and inspection and complete registration procedures in accordance with the regulations before June 30 of this year. Those who fail to do so within this deadline without proper reason, the "Bureau" may request approval from the "Ministry of Communications" to prohibit their navigation or revoke their ship ownership. 3. For ships of Chinese nationality that have changed their nationality after the outbreak of the war, unless they are submitted to the "Bureau" for submission to the "Ministry of Communications for supplementary approval, their change of nationality or change of circumstances will not be recognized.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Express Their Disregard</p>
<p>According to inquiries from the Daguang News Agency reporters to the shipping industry, since the "August 13th" incident, Chinese coastal areas have been blockaded by Japanese warships, and all Chinese merchant ships have been suspended. They have been sold to merchants from Germany, Italy, Portugal, and other countries. Therefore, all the ships on the lines now can be said to belong to foreign merchants. On the Chinese side, there are almost none. The transfer of property rights of each ship has been registered with the consulates of various countries in Shanghai, and licenses have been obtained. The governments of the respective countries have been notified by telegram and reported to the Tokyo government. Therefore, foreign merchants have no obligation to fulfill the registration notice of the "Navigation Administration Bureau." They can only ignore the notice. It is also learned that although there are still a few ships on the Chinese side, the merchants are also very aware of the righteousness and would rather sacrifice everything than go to register.</p>
<h3 id="e78">After Shantou Was Repeatedly Bombed, Japanese Planes Bombed Fuzhou Again. Incendiary Bombs in the Downtown Area, People Have Been Evacuated. Japanese Warships Gather at the Mouth of the Minjiang River, The Situation Has Not Relieved. <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>According to a telegram received by the shipping industry, Fuzhou was bombed by Japanese planes yesterday. Incendiary bombs were dropped in the downtown area, causing a major fire. The material losses were quite significant. Fortunately, the people had already been evacuated, and the residents who remained had all taken refuge in the countryside during the day, so there were few deaths and injuries. More than ten Japanese warships have gathered in the Minjiang Sea, and three more Japanese warships arrived outside the mouth of the Minjiang River on the 15th, including an aircraft carrier. The situation seems very tense. Shipping from Shanghai to Fujian Province has been virtually suspended. The ships sailing from Hong Kong and Shanghai to Fuzhou yesterday failed to load and unload passengers and cargo. At present, the military authorities of Fujian Province have ordered strict precautions to be taken to deal with all emergencies at any time.</p>
<p>Bombing Locations in Shantou The First Team of the World Red Cross Society's South China Relief Team is stationed in Shantou to provide medical treatment and to provide relief for the fires in the area, as well as to investigate and release the urgent needs of Nanao. According to the team's report, from April 27th to May 7th, the city's Wutou Bridge, Tongji Road, Huabu Tongji 123 and other roads, Ruiping Road, Xinma Road, Railway Station, Huilan Bridge, Zhongshan Road, Lian Road, Zhongshan Park, Qi, the old Sui Department's First Zhongbi, Huangjia Ancestral Hall, Donglong Beihai Jieyang Pier and other places were bombed for days, destroying houses and burning them. The deaths and injuries of the people were very tragic.</p>
<p>The Red Cross Provides Relief The team went to the disaster areas at any time to provide relief, with a total of more than fifty people killed and injured, and hundreds of houses destroyed. The team rescued more than 30 injured people and sent them to the Gospel Hospital for treatment. They also buried the dead with other charities. The injured were paid 6 yuan, 4 yuan, and 3 yuan for each, depending on the severity of the injury. At the beginning of the bombing, the team went to the affected areas to visit door-to-door, with a list of the number of injured people rescued, the injured parts, and the amount of money issued, and reported it to the general office of the association.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Scarlet Fever Among Jewish Refugees Has Passed, Only One Person Has Died Out of 180 People <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reported that, according to Mr. Weinstein, who is in charge of the Ward Road Jewish Refugee Shelter, the scarlet fever outbreak among Jewish refugees several weeks ago is now over. In the past nine days, there has been an average of one patient every two days. Most of the patients were not refugees living in the shelters with strict medical examinations, but those living outside the shelters. They were unaware of the disease until they infected others. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Health Department has done amazing work in this regard. Some of its staff members have been fighting this terrible disease in various shelters every day, returning home only at midnight. The shelter authorities have recently sent a letter to the director of the Health Department expressing their gratitude. Seventy scarlet fever patients in the temporary isolation hospital have recovered and been discharged. There are still a hundred people in the hospital rooms, all of whom are showing satisfactory improvement. So far, only one person has died, but his death was mostly due to his heart failure.</p>
<p>Newly Arrived Refugees Are Settled Separately According to the Shanghai Evening Post, 717 Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 15th) morning on the specially chartered Italian liner Caesar from Colombo. They landed at the customs pier in the afternoon. It is recalled that Sir Victor Sassoon appealed to all parties a few days ago to lend houses for these newcomers to live in. As a result, yesterday, 100 people lived in various shelters in the Hongshan District, 100 people lived in the Ward Road Shelter, 120 people lived in the former Hongkou branch of the HSBC Bank, which was allocated to the committee, 260 people entered the Zhaofeng Road Shelter, and the rest went to the Riverside Apartments. The committee expects 15,000 refugees to arrive this year, and fears that there will not be enough housing. They are currently studying the plan to build a large shelter. It is estimated that there are already 8,800 refugees in Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Japanese Side Actually Prohibits the Hanging of the Chinese Automobile Association Badge, Considering That It Is Now Worthless, But the Badge Is Worth Ten Dollars <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reported that when the Japanese side entertained reporters yesterday (the 15th), it revealed that Shanghai car owners who are members of the Chinese Automobile Association and have the association badge hanging on their cars will not be allowed to enter the Japanese-controlled areas around Shanghai unless they remove the badge. Because during yesterday's entertainment of reporters, an American reporter asked why the Japanese side stopped his car at the Waibaidu Bridge and ordered his driver to get out of the car and remove the badge before allowing him to drive on. A naval spokesman replied that the badge used by the association belongs to a regime that opposes Japan and is currently worthless. The Japanese authorities want car owners to remove this badge. The Japanese side's decision has not yet been notified to the secretary of the Chinese Automobile Association. When the spokesman was asked what the value of this badge is, he replied that it costs ten dollars to obtain it. It is very helpful to go to the countryside in various places. The spokesman continued that the badge has a blue sky and white sun background, which the Japanese side does not welcome very much. The reporter's car was stopped by a consular police officer and will now be investigated before notifying the general secretary or taking other steps.</p>

<p>Affixing stamps is a tax obligation that merchants should fulfill. Most stores in the concessions are now able to affix stamps as usual. However, there are also some who are trying to evade this statutory tax rule through various clever means. According to the law, anyone who attempts to evade this tax will be punished upon discovery at any time. Recently, some stores have even written the name, price, and recipient's name of the goods on the envelope in lieu of invoices and do not affix stamps. This kind of whimsical behavior is almost unheard of. A certain merchant that moved from Nanjing to the concession had a dispute with a customer due to issuing this kind of disguised invoice. In addition, there are also those who use the excuse that stamps cannot be purchased and do not affix them. It is understood that industry associations can now find ways to purchase them, so this kind of excuse is purely intended to evade taxes.</p>

<h3 id="e83">The Liaison Office for Employees of Two Railways Handles Charitable Affairs <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The total loss of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways during the August 13th Incident exceeded 40 million yuan. The Sino-British Bank, the agent of the creditors, whose investment accounted for 75% of the total assets of the railway, was unable to manage it well afterwards. More than 14,000 employees of the railway were evacuated. The railway employees formed a liaison office for employees of the two railways at No. 416 Sichuan Road to handle various charitable affairs and to negotiate with the authorities for funds to provide relief. There are still more than 7,000 employees of the two railways trapped on the isolated island, and their lives are extremely difficult. Although the authorities were responsible for negotiations through the office, they borrowed 300,000 yuan from the first savings fund last summer, and 200,000 yuan from the second savings fund in February this year to provide relief funds and repayments of debt to those who did not have savings funds. However, it was a drop in the bucket and difficult to sustain. The office has been handling various charitable affairs on its own, such as providing free clinics, sending poor employees and their families and children to shelters or orphanages, and providing free medical treatment for sick employees and their families from various hospitals and doctors. It also provides small credit loans, consumer cooperatives, medicine, vaccinations, smallpox vaccinations, free summer medicine, job introductions, employee communications, etc. Since its establishment, it has encountered many obstacles, but it has been able to maintain it until now. It is easy to say, but the funding is currently exhausted, and it is still doubtful whether it can continue for a long time. It is heard that the office is scheduled to administer vaccinations from May 18 (Monday to Friday, 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, Saturday only mornings). All employees of the two railways and their families can go for free injections.</p>

<p>Jiang Jianqiu (also known as Yu Jianming) from Nanjing has always been idle and has been making a living by stealing in the past. He has been punished by the court again and again. In recent years, after experiencing the taste of iron bars, he began to regret that the petty theft was boring, so he changed his policy and targeted dance hostesses. He used the ill-gotten wealth he had obtained to purchase clothing and dress himself up. Then he set foot in the dance halls and showed off his hunting skills. There were quite a few dance hostesses who were deceived and had relationships with him, but he</p>
<p>The Old Drunkard's Intention</p>
<p>is not in the wine, if he gets her property, he does not love her beauty, and then he takes care of others. Therefore, all the dance hostesses who lost their bodies and assets have nothing to do with him. Now he is defrauding Lu Meili, a dance hostess from the Dahua Dance Hall on Avenue Edward VII, of gold jewelry. Banknotes. Radios, etc., began when the case was exposed and arrested the day before yesterday. The dance hostess lives at No. 140, Dazhong Lane, Tongfu Road. She met Jiang in the Dahua Dance Hall last winter. At that time, Jiang claimed that he was the young owner of a jewelry store on Nanjing Road. Miss Lu saw that he was</p>
<p>Well Dressed</p>
<p>and belonged to Qingnian, and she deeply believed in him. From then on, she would meet him almost every night at Dahua. When Miss Lu finished dancing and returned, Jiang would accompany her. A kind of intimacy was no different from that of a married couple, so soon they both wanted to become lifelong partners. Miss Lu was more and more deceived. Until after the 15th of last month, Jiang saw that the opportunity had matured, so he began to show off his usual skills of deception and theft. At first, he only tried a small test, only defrauding her of a radio. Then he forged a</p>
<p>A Letter of Will</p>
<p>which roughly said that he was determined to marry Miss Tang (that is, Lu Meili) as his wife, but was opposed by his parents, so that a happy marriage could not be realized. Therefore, he decided to commit suicide and hoped that his parents would not be sad, etc. He took the opportunity to show the letter to Miss Lu first. Miss Lu was illiterate, so she asked someone in the same room to read it. Jiang, at this moment, stole 300 yuan in cash and diamond rings, etc. from Miss Lu's room and fled. When Miss Lu returned to the room, she found that</p>
<p>Both People and Wealth Were Lost</p>
<p>She realized that she had been fooled by Jiang. The previous love was false. She opened a loss list and reported it to the police station, requesting an investigation. The day before yesterday, detectives from the Chengdu Road Police Station learned of Jiang's hiding place and rushed to arrest him. The stolen radio and other items were taken out, but only a dozen yuan of cash remained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Fang opened the court to interrogate him. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the fraud committed by the defendant and stated that</p>
<p>According to the dance hostess</p>
<p>the defendant has used this method to defraud other dance hostesses of their property more than once. Therefore, he requested a postponement in order to continue the investigation. Then Lu Meili filed a case and explained the facts of the defendant's deception and theft. When asked Jiang, his confession was vague. The court ordered the defendant to be detained and adjourned the trial. The stolen goods and money were first returned to the original owner to take away.</p>

<p>Zhu Xiang, who lives at No. 11, Hongxiang Lane, Xinzha Road, and his eight-year-old son Fusheng went to see a play at the Shaoxing Theater attached to the Tongshang Hotel at No. 42 Avenue Haig on the evening of the 15th at 8:00 PM. He bought a ticket and entered the theater in accordance with the regulations. However, after a while, Zhu Hai went out because of something and then re-entered. However, the ticket collector Wang Hongshun from Shandong refused to let him enter again. Zhu Hai argued with him. Wang saw that the child was</p>
<p>Young and Deceivable</p>
<p>He slapped the child twice. After the child was insulted, he ran home and told his parents. Zhu Xiang accompanied his neighbor Xu Tairen to negotiate, but Wang and others not only refused to confess their guilt, but Wang gathered tea room staff Lu Debao, Xu Bingyu, Xu Songqiao, and monk Zhu and others, first scolded them, and then surrounded and beat Xu.</p>

<p>Qiu Yuting, a local young man residing at No. 763, Fahua West Town, Shanghai West, was twenty-two years old this year. He was a third-year student at the Education College of Da Xia University on Jing'an Temple Road and had also founded a small school in Fahua Town where he resided, acting as its principal. His father, Qiu Fengji, also known as Qiu Shusheng, was forty-eight years old this year and engaged in the coal business, operating his own coal company. At 8:15 a.m. yesterday, Qiu Yuting, wearing a brown plaid tweed suit and carrying a briefcase, was walking eastward along Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession when, upon reaching the sidewalk in front of the open space west of Zhengjia Wood Bridge (where the Nanyang Tobacco Company had erected a "Treasure Sword" cigarette advertisement), three young men in blue cloth short shirts and pants suddenly rushed out from the roadside and followed behind Qiu. One of the three men took out a gun and fired a shot at the back of Qiu's head. The bullet hit Qiu in the back of the head, and he fell to the ground instantly. Seeing that their purpose had been achieved, the three young men shouted and scattered into the crowd, disappearing in a moment. At the time of the incident, pedestrians on the road, upon hearing the sudden gunshot, initially suspected it was a rickshaw tire bursting. However, when they saw someone fall to the ground with blood gushing from their head, they realized a murder had occurred. Subsequently, the patrol officers stationed at the intersection of Zhengjia Wood Bridge arrived after being informed and immediately reported to the competent Mailan Police Station. An ambulance was summoned and rushed to the scene to transport Qiu to Guangci Hospital for treatment. At the same time, a report was made to the Lujiawan Central Police Station, which dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to investigate. The detectives searched Qiu's pockets and briefcase, finding a diary with an entry stating "Received 60,000 yuan from Yu Jishi," as well as a travel permit and documents for travel between Shanghai and Zhenjiang. However, because the injury was to a vital area, despite the doctors' best efforts, it was impossible to save him. At 2:15 p.m., he succumbed to his injuries and died. The police station immediately transported the body to the autopsy room attached to the Shanghai Municipal Council Hospital (small sick room) on Tauras Road and notified the family of the deceased, awaiting the dispatch of personnel from the Special No. 2 District Court Prosecutor's Office for an autopsy today to determine the cause of death. The police station is currently investigating the matter. It is said that the deceased had studied aviation piloting techniques, hence the rumor circulating after the incident yesterday that the aviation team was the victim.</p>

<p>He Xiaomei, a native of Ningbo, thirty-eight years old this year, with an unknown occupation and address, went to the attic room on the third floor of No. 50 Moulin Rouge Street in the French Concession at 2:00 p.m. on the 15th to visit his fellow townsman, Ping Ruigen. At the time, Shen Rusheng, a native of Shaoxing, forty-three years old this year, who was also friends with He, had arrived at Ping's place before He. However, He owed Shen one yuan and two jiao in legal tender. Shen demanded payment from He, leading to a conflict. Subsequently, He went to the stairwell and was pushed by Shen. He lost his balance, resulting in a fall that injured his waist. Shen then transported He to Renji Hospital. He died after ineffective medical treatment. The hospital reported to the French Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Shen. The body was then transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch of the autopsy room. Unable to locate the deceased's family, yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren from the Special No. 2 District Court arrived at the location to conduct an autopsy, confirming that the deceased had died from injuries sustained in the fall. The body was claimed by the mortuary. The defendant, Shen Rusheng, was transferred by the police station to the Special No. 2 District Court yesterday afternoon with a request for detention and investigation, with a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<p>There is a group in Shanghai known as the "White Tiger Gang," which is composed of influential individuals who raise young children and people involved in opium, scattering them at various docks. When cotton ships arrive in Shanghai, they seize the opportunity to steal cotton, which the masterminds then purchase at a low price and later sell at a good price. Gu Sandi, also known as Xiao Sandi, also known as Ma Zi, is known as the "Kingpin" in this gang. Police officers had been paying attention to their activities for some time but lacked evidence. It wasn't until the other day that Chinese Detective Wang Chengying from the General Police Station arrested Zhang and accomplices Wang Wanzhang, Zhou Guigui, Yao Damao, and others at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Chongqing Road. Gu was transporting 280 pounds of stolen cotton from East Chessboard Street, intending to transport it elsewhere. Detective Wang followed them to Avenue Edward VII and then requested the assistance of Chinese Constable No. 1202 to arrest the group. Yesterday morning, they were transferred to the Fourth Criminal Court of the Special No. 1 District Court. The police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the case, stating that a detailed investigation was still needed and requesting permission for temporary detention pending further investigation. After Judge Dai Rongduo reviewed the case and briefly questioned the defendants, he ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody, with a rescheduled hearing.</p>

<p>The British-owned Lun Chang Textile, Dyeing, and Printing Co., Ltd., is the largest and most modern textile factory in the Far East. The factory began construction in 1934 and was completed in 1935, immediately starting production. Since 1936, it has had 44,000 yarn spindles, 3,640 thread spindles, and 1,130 looms. Therefore, Lun Chang produces various guaranteed non-fading fabrics, from raw cotton to finished products. All spinning, weaving, dyeing, and printing are carried out under the supervision of British personnel at the factory by thousands of Chinese workers. On May 13, this newspaper reported that the British-owned Lun Chang Textile, Dyeing, and Printing Co., Ltd., planned to increase the number of yarn spindles to 44,000 to achieve the goal of self-spinning, self-weaving, self-dyeing, self-wetting, and self-printing. Due to hasty investigation, there was a slight misunderstanding. Lun Chang Textile, Dyeing, and Printing Co., Ltd., has had 44,000 yarn spindles since 1935 and has been operating at full capacity since 1936. Therefore, the yarn produced is sufficient to meet the needs of the factory's 1,130 looms without relying on external supply.</p>

<p>Chinese Established Wire Factory: Li Xinhui, Zhou Jiaogui, Zheng Xiongshu, Tong Zhikai, Wang Dehong, and others in the Shanghai electrical industry, seeing that the demand for wire is very high and that it has always been imported from abroad, resulting in significant leakage of wealth, raised funds to establish the Gongxin Wire and Electrical Appliance Factory, specializing in the manufacture of various wires and electrical appliances. It is now learned that the factory's machinery and factory buildings will be fully prepared and ready for production soon. The temporary office is temporarily located in the Qianyi Public Bank at No. 131, Jiangxi Road.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Letter <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I have read the news in your newspaper about the collapse of a foreign terrace. No. 352, Shangxianfang, Avenue Joffre, is a long-established business, and the house is still solid and not old. The news in your newspaper is completely inconsistent with the facts. An apprentice in our store, Zhang Aguangg, accidentally fell down the stairs the other day, resulting in a minor injury. After being treated at Nanyang Hospital, he returned to the store. The big landlord's patrol officer has investigated, and the cement terrace is still very solid. I am writing this letter to request that you make a correction to show the truth.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Junyimao Record Western Clothing Store</p>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>The news in your newspaper on May 14 about the cause of the fire at No. 70, Guling Road, is completely inconsistent with the facts. The house at No. 70, Guling Road, is not rented by me but by Chen Ruihua. Chen runs various waste paper businesses, so the house is piled with paper everywhere, even in the hallway. In a room next to the stairs, a large amount of burnt newsprint is piled up, and the pile of newspapers is only a door away from the stove, which is a hidden danger. My employed old steward, Shi Chenglang, is honest and reliable. Every morning at around 5:00 a.m., after cooking the rice porridge, he leaves his home to go to work in the warehouse. The fuel used on weekdays is all easy-to-extinguish materials such as straw bags and does not use items such as yarn balls or copper pipes as fuel. Therefore, there is no copper pipe in the ashes, and there is no need to place the ashes at the back door. Moreover, the old steward has always been in the habit of pouring the ashes into the trash can every morning. What the newspaper reported is not true. Also, after the incident that day, Shi stood next to the fire site all day without leaving for a moment. That night, he was allowed by the Fire Brigade to enter the house to guard the items, and the next day he helped me move the undamaged items. The so-called escape without a trace is also a misrepresentation and inconsistent with the facts. Please make a correction.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h3 id="e103">Longevity of Scientists <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>When we turn the pages of the history of scientific development or the biographies of famous scientists, the deepest impression we get is that the great figures in science all live long lives. Figures such as Newton, Darwin, and Pasteur all lived beyond the age of seventy. There are even those who lived beyond ninety while remaining intelligent and prolific, such as Wallace in England and Haeckel and Ostwald in Germany. Although not everyone in the scientific community with great achievements can achieve longevity, on average, those who enjoy longevity account for more than 70 percent. If we examine their life stories, we know that there is indeed a reason why they are able to do so. Scientists devote their lives to the pursuit of knowledge, their thoughts are extremely pure, their morals are naturally noble, and their spirits are rejuvenated daily. This is one reason. The work they do has a certain routine, and all their rest, living habits, and diet are well-organized, most in line with the laws of nature, or in other words, most in line with hygiene. This is another reason. The deeper their research, the more they see the mysteries of nature, and when their skills reach a certain level, they have great enjoyment. This is a third reason. There are endless problems in science. When one problem is solved, new phenomena arise. After solving a problem, they get considerable gratification; they go on to study new problems, morning and evening, with endless hope. Their interest becomes stronger and stronger. This is a fourth reason. Scientists value their time and cherish their energy the most. They devote themselves wholeheartedly to research and are unwilling to waste their efforts on meaningless things. All the entertainment in society that can damage human health cannot affect them. This is a fifth reason. With these reasons, the more scientists work, the more significant their achievements. Achieving longevity through the study of science and becoming a great scientist only because of longevity are mutually causal. With the development of modern biology and the common knowledge of hygiene and nutrition among scientists, the number of long-lived scientists will be countless in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Talking About Tigers <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>— He Shi</p>
<p>Part One</p>
<p>Tigers are carnivorous animals with the fiercest nature. They are found in the major mountains of central China, as well as in southern Fujian and Guangdong, and in the northeastern provinces. This is a rough outline of their recent distribution. Tigers in the central and western regions, such as Mount Emei, Mount Song, and Mount Taihang, are more yellow in color, longer in body, and shorter in legs. The tigers of South China are the same as those produced in the Bay of Bengal. Seventy or eighty years ago, Shanghai was not as densely populated as it is today. In the desolate areas on the outskirts of the city, traces of tigers were once found, indicating that their distribution extended directly from the Bay of Bengal to Fujian, Guangdong, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. These tigers are spotted yellow in color, shorter and taller in body, and similar to the tigers of India. However, Indian tigers are paler in color and taller in body. Tigers in the northeastern provinces are called Manchurian tigers by Westerners. They are white in color, and occasionally there are blue ones, but these are extremely rare. These are the only tigers that exist in our country today. In animal taxonomy, they are all one species, with the scientific name Felis tigris. The various types mentioned above are only variants and cannot be called a separate species. There are rumors that tigers have been discovered in Mount Yu, but today, forests are dwindling, and human habitation is increasing, so they must have become extinct.</p>
<p>Part Two</p>
<p>The reason why tigers are fierce beasts is because of their extraordinary ferocity. However, without their claws and teeth, even a hero would be useless. I once remembered seeing a tiger tamer performing on stage. Other people were watching. I saw a tiger that was magnificent and awe-inspiring. An iron chain was tied around its neck and secured to a wooden stake. The tiger saw the audience, its eyes flashing, and it walked around the stake, as if it wanted to devour them. A strong man held a stick and fought with the tiger. The tiger scratched with its claws and bit with its mouth, but the strong man was not afraid, and he was not hurt in the end. Finally, he raised the stick and roared at it. The tiger crouched and glared at him, but there was nothing it could do. Many people suspected that this man had magic, but when they examined the tiger closely, they found that it had no teeth in its mouth and no claws on its feet. Even with great strength, it could not use it. It turned out that when the tamer got this tiger, he had already cut off its claws and teeth, so it could be used for profit. An enthusiast threw a piece of beef at it, and the tiger swallowed it whole. The tamer claimed that this tiger came from Mount Emei, but his accent was from the Central Plains, so he probably got it from Mount Song or Mount Taihang.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Ethylene Gas <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Jun</p>
<p>A Safe Anesthetic - A Ripening Agent for Fruit Leaves</p>
<p>Anyone who has seen Carnations knows that they are very beautiful flowers. In 1908, a dispirited florist asked two doctors, Krocker, at the University of Chicago: when the weather is cold, he closes the ventilators in the greenhouse to prevent cold air from entering and damaging the flowers. As a result, for three consecutive years, the carnations in the greenhouse did not thrive. In the third year, he noticed a smell of gas. After careful investigation, he found a leaking gas pipe. After repairing it, the carnations grew normally. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>It turns out that the bracts and flowers of carnations are very sensitive to gas. If there is one part of gas in 20,000 parts of air, the medium-sized flower buds will wither within twelve hours; one part in 40,000 will cause the opening flower buds to wither; one part in 80,000 will cause the open flowers to shrink and not bloom again.</p>
<p>Gas is produced by dry-steaming coal in iron bottles, and it contains carbon monoxide, hydrogen, ethylene gas, and various other gases mixed together. Among these many gases, ethylene gas (Kchylene) is the most important. If there is one part in 2,000,000 parts of air, it can cause carnations to wither within twelve hours. However, chemical tests do not have such a sensitive method to test for this one part of ethylene gas in 2,000,000 parts. After research, it was found that carnations are not the most sensitive. Other plants, such as tomatoes, salvia, and lentils, are hindered in their growth by one part of ethylene gas in 1,000 parts. Of course, there are also many plants that are not affected by gas or ethylene gas at all.</p>
<p>The roots of plants can also be damaged by gas in the soil. This is another trouble caused by ethylene gas. Although the gas needs to be quite concentrated in the soil to damage the roots, the soil itself will absorb the gas to such a concentration. The gas can accumulate in the soil and reach the roots of the trees, and the trees will die in a few weeks. However, there is no odor on the ground. Gas companies certainly do not welcome botanists to discover this fact, but it is beneficial to the industry to draw attention to it.</p>
<p>Ethylene gas has the above-mentioned strange effect on plants. As for animals, if it is more than 80% (80, 85%) and mixed with oxygen, it becomes a very good anesthetic, better than ether, chloroform, and nitrous oxide. Because it does not cause death from intoxication, does not cause sweating, does not cause the patient to vomit or feel uncomfortable, and the patient wakes up quickly. Therefore, it is worth using this new anesthetic in many surgical operations.</p>
<p>When any carbon compound burns, if there is not enough oxygen, or if there is enough oxygen but the temperature is too low, the combustion is incomplete, and carbon monoxide and ethylene gas are formed. For example, burning paper, garbage, kerosene stoves, and smoking cigarettes, cigars, and pipes often cause this situation.</p>
<p>In the United States, some places use kerosene stoves to ripen fruits. Later, it was found that it was not because of the heat of the kerosene stove, but because of the gas generated when it burns incompletely. The gas emitted by car engines is also effective. However, it is very important to be careful when using kerosene stoves, as they often cause the fruit to turn black from smoke and make the citrus fruits turn yellow, with no certainty of the result, and there is also the risk of fire. Later, after research by American chemists, it was found that using ethylene gas is very effective, from one part of ethylene gas in one million parts of air to one part of ethylene gas in five thousand parts of air; the temperature can also be high or low. Therefore, in California, the United States, this simple method is now widely used to turn oranges yellow, which can save half the time compared to before, and the management is much more accurate. Similarly, to promote the ripening of difficult honeydew melons, it is necessary to put them in a greenhouse for fumigation, which is also the effect of ethylene gas.</p>
<p>The ancients said: "Pulling up seedlings to help them grow" is a metaphor for being impatient and acting recklessly, which is harmful and useless. After the invention of chemistry, there can be methods to help growth without "pulling" them. This method is to use drugs or growth promoters, such as ether and chloroform, which have this function. However, the concentration of these things must be well-matched. If it is too concentrated, it will also lead to "pulling up seedlings to help them grow" because these anesthetics are very toxic. There is no such danger when using ethylene gas. For example, for citrus fruits, ethylene gas can be used almost casually without causing damage. In the future, perhaps other gases like ethylene gas will be discovered that are even better growth promoters. Science is progressing day by day. The enjoyment of mankind is also increasing.</p>

<p>— Ye Ren</p>
<p>Radio can not only transmit sound to distant places for people to hear, but also transmit scenery to distant places for people to see. The method of transmitting moving scenes by radio is called television. Television is the latest invention in the scientific world, and it has progressed extremely rapidly in recent years, with a trend towards becoming as widespread as radios. The illustration shows a portable television receiving unit, just like a telephone extension, which can be placed anywhere in the home. Each extension has its own cathode ray tube and a lens that magnifies the image. The images transmitted from afar are received by a central unit in one location and then transmitted to the extensions. In addition to being portable, its screen can be tilted to the most convenient angle for the viewer.</p>
<h3 id="e107">The Microscopic World in a Drop of Water <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Ren</p>
<p>Dr. George Roemmerr's presentation of the microscopic world of life in a drop of water will be one of the most eye-catching events at the Westinghouse Electric Company exhibit at the New York World's Fair. The doctor places a drop of water on a glass slide and uses a microscopic projector to project the microorganisms in the drop of water onto a screen five feet in diameter. Various microorganisms are magnified 2,000 times, and their shapes and colors are exactly the same as the originals. The production, love, diet, death, and other aspects of life of these single-celled animals, which are usually invisible to the naked eye, are all vividly displayed and visible to everyone. The attached picture shows one of the performances of the doctor's twelve microscopic projectors. The active state of these microorganisms is often obvious. However, when Westinghouse-made sterilization lamps are used to concentrate the four rays of light on this drop of water world, these organisms immediately tremble, shrink, rupture, and eventually die.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Going in Circles <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>— Qiao Xia Ke</p>
<p>Going in circles means circling around a certain direction, and the result is still close to the starting point. But there are two ways to go in circles, and although the situations are very similar, the final achievements cannot be compared. The first type is like carrying a coffin over the city wall. After circling around, you still end up in the same old place; in scientific terms, it can be said that the whole circle is circling in a plane. The second type is a spiral circle. Although the direction remains unchanged when circling, when you return to the starting point, you will find that you have risen, and the old place has fallen beneath your feet; in scientific terms, it can be said that this type of circling must leave its original plane at all times. Using the first type of circling, you will still be in the same old place after circling a thousand or ten thousand times. Using the second type of circling, you will be in the clouds after circling a thousand or ten thousand times. Therefore, it can be said that the achievements cannot be compared.</p>
<p>In the past, teaching in private schools was always the same old thing, just like carrying a coffin over the city wall. So after circling for two hundred years, it was still circling in the same plane. Teaching science is different. Everyone says that science is always progressing, but what is the form of progress? Is it like a kite, blown into the sky by a gust of wind? Is it like climbing Mount Emei, going up and down, although eventually reaching the golden summit? I hope that sometimes it is like flying a kite, and I do not deny that sometimes it is like climbing Mount Emei, but what I want to say now is spiral progress, the same as going in circles, but the result is very different from the private schools of the past.</p>
<p>The material cited is understandable even in rural villages. Forty years ago, the salt used in our kitchen was grayish-black, of course because it was not pure. In addition to the salt itself (i.e., pure sodium chloride), there were other mixed salts, probably in the same proportion as the various salts in seawater. These mixed salts tend to absorb moisture. Later, with the progress of science, the salt in the kitchen also underwent the baptism of refining, and thus snowy white salt replaced grayish-black salt. At the same time, in medicine, it was advocated how good sodium is for the human body, while chlorine, the counterpart of sodium, was considered a villain related to edema. In less than thirty years, a circle has come around. The villain related to edema (such as dropsy) is sodium, not chlorine, and sodium must be in a certain proportion with other mixed salts (such as calcium and potassium) to be beneficial and harmless to the human body. This proportion is about the same as the proportion of salts in seawater. Oh dear, we still use grayish-black salt. If we can still buy such salt and eat it every day, perhaps some people will say, what tricks are you scientists playing? After thirty years, you have "returned to the old ways," which shows that the old habits are correct and cannot be changed. Forgive me, these ready-made words often confuse the public, and must be criticized. Eating black salt after thirty years is eating with knowledge of the reason, it can be said to be eating with clear understanding. In the past, my great-grandmother also ate black salt, but she ate without knowing the reason, eating in confusion. The same as eating black salt, but finding that great-grandmother is standing below, shows that this circle is definitely not circling in a plane, but is a spiral progress. Unfortunately, those who are standing together with great-grandmother have not yet caught up to the plane above, and are panting and groaning in complaint, so I cite an example to analyze the position in a hundred ways.</p>

<p>— Peisheng</p>
<p>Nitrogen consumption has increased sevenfold in the past thirty-five years. Today, the world's production is about 2.5 million tons per year, about the same as copper production, but the potential need is twice this, because every country has to ensure! Use nitrogen to make explosives.</p>
<p>However, most of the world's normal production must be consumed in various peaceful undertakings, such as the manufacture of cultivated fertilizers, opening explosives, industrial nitric acid, and dyes, photographic films, and other nitric acid machinery.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Finance: Tense Atmosphere Prevails, Cash Purchases Surge, Those Holding Goods Reluctant to Sell Easily <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's situation in the cash market for 烚赤 (a type of gold bar or gold-related investment) was still revolving around the opening price. Although securities firms, a certain gold firm, and a certain silver shop were mutually buying and selling, the gold and money exchange industries still had a strong intention to sell, and the situation changed little. In the afternoon, rumors of a certain tense atmosphere in the city suddenly spread, causing panic among the people, and floating investors flocked to buy, causing the market to tighten and the bullish trend to be strong. It broke out of the 30 yuan mark, and it was still difficult to find opponents, because those holding goods, seeing the tense situation, were reluctant to sell easily, hoping to raise the price to 38 yuan before selling and making a profit that day. However, there were very few transactions. As a result, the price rose by 10 yuan, and people's hearts were tight and high. Trading was not active, with only over 400 taels traded. Silver shop jewelry gold also rose by 1 yuan. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>烚赤 Rises by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar of 10 taels opened quite flat. First, the securities firm (Tianjin firm) purchased a total of 100 taels from the gold firm, with the opening price of 2,127 yuan, which was the same as the previous closing price. After opening, the silver shop firms mutually traded 50 taels, priced at 28 yuan. At that time, the buying momentum was slightly weak, and the money exchange industry forced 50 taels to the gold firm, and the price fell by 3 yuan to 25 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm came to buy again, and it immediately saw a rebound. A certain gold firm entered 50 taels from the same industry, priced at 27 yuan. Later, another 50 taels were entered into the money exchange industry, priced at 28 yuan. Later, the silver shop firms also entered 50 taels into the money exchange industry, and the price was the same. After that, there were buyers but no sellers, resulting in no transactions. The afternoon closing price was still 28 yuan. The afternoon opening was quiet, but after 2 pm, rumors of a certain atmosphere in the city suddenly spread, causing panic among the people. Those holding cash flocked to buy, and the market suddenly tightened. As for those holding goods, seeing the tense situation, they all adopted a reserved attitude. Although the price was raised to above 30 yuan, it was still difficult to find opponents. At around 3 pm, it was heard that a certain money exchange fruit market department outside the market had absorbed 50 taels from the securities firm, priced at 34 yuan. In the market, a transaction was not seen until 3:50 pm. First, the money exchange industry entered 50 taels from a certain gold firm, priced at 38 yuan. At 4 pm, a certain silver shop (acting for a gold firm) entered 50 taels from the money exchange industry (acting for a securities firm), priced at 2,137 yuan, as the late closing price. As a result, the price rose by 10 yuan compared to the previous closing price, with a daily difference of 13 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold firm's own brand gold was 2,145 yuan, and the purchase price was 2,130 yuan. The current standard gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Increases by Another 1 Yuan</p>
<p>The selling price of gold jewelry per tael in silver shops did not change at first. However, at around 4 pm in the evening, because 烚赤 suddenly soared by 10 yuan, it was also increased by 1 yuan. Da Tong Heng changed to 217 yuan, Xin Tong Heng 215 yuan, and the purchase price was 209 yuan.</p>
<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Unchanged</p>
<p>London, 15th, telegraph. British pure gold remained stable and unchanged, and the price per ounce remained at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 5 and a half pence. The Bank of China's cash purchase price for China also stood at 1,211 yuan and 9 jiao. The listed customs gold price was also flat, at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also did not change, at 1,207 yuan and 2 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Hong Kong and Dutch List Prices Narrow, British and American Exchange Rates Stable with Tightening <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market saw frequent settlements of spot goods by foreign firms, and the Bank of England's profits also came to be settled. In addition, the bank's supply was not smooth, resulting in an initial price of 8 and a half shillings and 25 yuan for British gold, and 16 yuan and 0.0625 yuan for American exchange, which were difficult to settle. However, soon after, the foreign firms' intention to sell re-emerged, resulting in a return to flatness. Futures also saw relentless settlements by the Bank of England's profits (acting for the Tianjin firm and the Japanese banking industry), and the bank's intention to supply also turned slightly weaker, resulting in a situation that was stable with a slight softening. As a result, swaps also opened up slightly, and trading was still active. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, HSBC's list price suddenly narrowed by half a yuan, and the dark market also tended to tighten slightly due to the efforts of money exchange industries to settle.</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London large bar was 0.0625 long for both near and far periods, the New York spot price was stable, and the London gold price was stable. The British exchange rate was up 1 li and 3 hao against the US dollar, and flat against Shanghai and France. The US dollar was up 1.25 against the British pound, and unchanged against Shanghai and France. The central list prices for various exchange rates were as before. The bank's opening spot selling prices in the morning were 8 and a half shillings and 25 yuan for British exchange, and 16 yuan and 0.0625 yuan for American exchange, which were both flat compared to the previous closing price. After opening, although foreign firms settled a lot, the bank's intention to supply was also strong, and there were few changes. It was estimated that the foreign firms settled HSBC and Dutch spot British gold at 8 and a half shillings and 25 yuan, and also settled a certain bank's spot American exchange at 16 yuan and 0.0625 yuan. When HSBC's list price was announced, the Dutch exchange rate narrowed by 0.375 yuan, the Hong Kong exchange rate also fell by half a yuan, and the rest remained at the original price. The silver balance tax was announced at 2 and a half li, estimated at 5.50%. At that time, profits (acting for the Tianjin firm and the Japanese banking industry) settled spot British gold with money exchange industries at 8 and a half shillings and 25 yuan, and the situation seemed slightly soft. Later, the profits' settlement intention became even stronger, and they also strongly purchased British and American gold futures. In addition, the bank's intention to supply was weak, resulting in a slight tightening. It was estimated that the profits settled Dutch July British gold at 8 and a half shillings and 25 yuan, and then purchased China Bank's June American exchange at 15 yuan and 0.875 yuan. At noon, the trading of British and American gold turned sparse, with only Hong Kong exchange trading. It was estimated that the money exchange industries strongly purchased Dutch and Anda spot prices at only 95 yuan and 0.375 yuan, and the situation was also slightly soft. At the noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 8 and a half shillings and 25 yuan for British exchange, and 16 yuan and 0.0625 yuan for American exchange, which were not much different from the morning opening. The Hong Kong exchange rate was 55 yuan and 0.375 yuan.</p>
<p>Although foreign firms and profits continued to settle in the afternoon, the bank's intention to supply turned bullish, and yarn and flower firms also came to sell slightly, so the situation was very flat. First, the foreign firms settled HSBC spot British gold at 8 and a half shillings and 25 yuan, and then settled Hua Bi spot American exchange at 16 yuan and 0.0625 yuan. Later, profits and Hua Bi absorbed the yarn and flower firms' June British gold at 8 and a half shillings and 0.1875 yuan, and June American exchange at 15 yuan and 0.9375 yuan. Soon after, profits also settled China Bank's July American exchange at 15 yuan and 0.8125 yuan. After entering, Hua Yi sold spot Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms at 55 yuan and 0.375 yuan, and the market situation was still flat. At the late closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 8 and a half shillings and 25 yuan for British exchange, 16 yuan and 0.0625 yuan for American exchange, and 55 yuan and 0.375 yuan for Hong Kong exchange. As a result, compared to the previous night's closing, the British and American exchange rates were neither honored nor disgraced, and the Hong Kong exchange rate softened by 0.125 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, British pure gold was unchanged, and the British and American exchange rates rose by 0.125 yuan. In the local exchange market, foreign firms settled their accounts very actively, and Tianjin firms and Japanese banks absorbed vigorously. Fortunately, the supply of foreign banks was smooth, and the market price was stable. The 烚赤 companies and silver shops had strong supply and demand, and retail investors also made good profits. In the afternoon, the gold firms' settlement trend was strong, and rumors were rampant in the market, causing panic among the people. The opening market price soared, and wealthy people absorbed it frequently, and money exchange industries and others took advantage of the high prices to sell aggressively, and the closing price was firm, resulting in a significant increase compared to the previous day. The future of gold prices seems to be promising. Foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds were actively absorbed by wealthy people, and British and American gold notes were in great demand. The supply of Hong Kong notes, Canadian notes, and Australian gold notes was not smooth, and the market situation was strong, all trending upward. Only the demand for Japanese gold notes was weak, and the price fell alone, already falling below legal tender. There were no transactions in the guild. Yesterday's market prices were: British gold pounds up 0.2 yuan, British gold notes up 0.04 yuan, American gold pounds up 0.3 yuan, American gold notes up 0.011 yuan, Hong Kong notes up 0.001 yuan, Canadian notes up 0.01 yuan, Australian gold notes up 0.05 yuan, and other currencies were unchanged.</p>

<p>The dark market for securities yesterday became increasingly chaotic, and the bearish trend gradually intensified. Rumors in the local area were rampant, and people's hearts were extremely panicked. It was said that there was financial sabotage and local issues. Small retail longs were rushing to sell. Large longs who had been buying continuously in the past had accumulated over 7 million, which was too big to fail. Therefore, they had reached a saturation point and had been taking a wait-and-see attitude in recent days. The longs from the 20th and Da Tong had both withdrawn. Da Feng, which had exited earlier, trended weak throughout the day. After A bonds broke through the 60 yuan mark, they had already retreated to within 59 yuan. B, D, and E bonds were all approaching the 50 yuan mark, and the situation was dire, and it seemed that they would inevitably break through the 50 yuan mark. However, the public should know that public bonds are not speculative products. A temporary phenomenon will eventually disappear. Why be so anxious? Yesterday, the selling pressure was high. Da Feng Hao took the lead in selling, and the opening price was down by 0.3 or 0.4 yuan. Those who followed included Lian He, Yong Feng, Song Mao, and the 25th and 35th, and the market price became increasingly unsustainable. Buyers were very scarce. Only Qia Feng, Tian Sheng, Heng Fu, Tong Kang, and the 18th had some short covering. In the morning, they were down by 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, or 0.7 yuan. A bonds broke through the 60 yuan mark. In the afternoon, the situation became even more chaotic. Da Feng Hao continued to sell aggressively, and Yu Ji's selling was also quite strong. The 8th and Yong Kang Hao also sold. The rest were small retail investors who were also eager to sell. Most of the buyers were small short covering, such as Tian Sheng, Lian He, and Heng Fu, which had a small amount of short covering. The 18th and 35th also recovered slightly, but the downward trend was extremely difficult to reverse. A bonds retreated further into the 59 yuan mark. B, D, and E bonds were all at the minimum market price. As a result, the closing market price fell by 0.85 yuan to 1.55 yuan. The total number of transactions was about 1.5 million yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 100 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity shares were traded, priced at 6 yuan, 3 jiao, and 0.375 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce Stock Market: The opening was visibly weak. Retail investors liquidated most of their stocks, and all stocks suffered minor losses. Jardine Matheson shares fell to 35 yuan and 0.25 jiao, and Ewo shares fell to 15 yuan and a half. The closing price of public transport shares was 29 yuan and a half, and the closing price of tram shares was 39 yuan. The price of Kailan shares was 27 yuan and 0.25 jiao, and the price of reclamation shares was 7 yuan and 0.85 jiao. These two stocks were more stable, and there were more buyers than sellers. In terms of the actual situation, the stock market should be good, but due to the political instability, the market sentiment seems to be fluctuating accordingly.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks continue to be in demand, with Rubber Trust shares being the most prominent, priced at 4 yuan and 0.2 jiao. British rubber raw material inventories decreased sharply by another 1,343 tons last week, and now total 65,977 tons.</p>
<p>London Far East British Far East companies' stocks: On the 15th of this month (Monday), the listed prices of the stocks were all unchanged. London Chinese foreign debts were stable on the 15th of this month (Monday), and the listed prices were all unchanged. London physical goods were offered for sale. Only one type of Jinpu Railway bond was a German-issued bond ticket with an original loan of 1,000 pounds, and a British-issued bond ticket with a continued loan of 5,000 pounds, and a German-issued bond ticket of 1,000 pounds, totaling 8,000 pounds. The selling price was 18 pounds and 5 shillings, a slight increase of 5 shillings from the market price. Within the enclosure, a certain party's troops are not allowed to cultivate sorghum or millet to avoid guerrilla attacks, and cotton must be planted. As for the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, most of them are in the hands of guerrillas, and the situation of new cotton is not too pessimistic.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Cotton Yarn　Small Stockpilers Suddenly Emerge　Yarn Prices Gradually Decline　Shenxin Continues to Release　Fine Yarn Transactions Still Strong <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, and the trend is showing slight weakness. Hong Kong merchants' purchases continue to be strong, but confidence has not been boosted. The market cannot follow suit and instead retreats. In reality, the environment is poor, and some small stockpilers have suddenly emerged, causing the market to loosen up. At the same time, the Chaoshan area has been severely bombed by Japanese planes, and telegrams for goods have been temporarily suspended for shipment. Therefore, those holding goods are unloading late according to the market price, leading to price softening. In the afternoon, a group from Shantou, tempted by the low prices, purchased 300 bales. It is noted that the main purchases by various groups are 32-count single yarn and 42-count double-ply yarn.</p>
<p>Current yarn situation: At the opening this morning, market sentiment was normal, and enthusiasm was lacking. At the same time, customer demand was not strong, and prices remained unchanged. 20-count Double Horse brand yarn from foreign warehouses was priced at 432 yuan, and warehouse receipts were 422.7 yuan. Shortly after, Hong Kong purchases were mostly 32-count single yarn, and interest in 20-count yarn was slack. The market then saw a gradual decline. In an instant, Double Horse spot goods fell to 426.5 yuan, and warehouse receipts were 419 yuan, a drop of 4 to 5 yuan from the opening price. It is said that a certain yarn firm deliberately lowered prices to sell off. In reality, speculative bulls, seeing the fatigue of Japanese yarn, were less interested and liquidated their positions. By the close, some later bargain hunters bought goods, causing a slight rebound of 0.5 to 1 yuan. The afternoon opening market was calm, with no major difference from the morning. Double Horse warehouse receipts were priced at 420 to 419 yuan, and foreign warehouse goods were 429 to 428.5 yuan. It is noted that the total purchases by various groups throughout the day amounted to 1,375 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 3.5 yuan, Tiannv (Celestial Maiden) by 1 yuan, and Muyang (Shepherd) by 2 yuan. 32-count single yarn rose by 2 to 3 yuan. It is also reported that the Shenxin factory released 1,000 bales of 20-count Tiannv yarn, priced at 425 yuan, with 30% paid by draft and 70% by remittance, with a term of 6 to 7 months. Today, 40 bales of cotton yarn were shipped to Xiamen, 55 bales to Shantou, and 15 bales to Hong Kong. The purchase volume of each group is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Sichuan 15 Hong Kong 565</p>
<p>Fellow Traders 280 Mainland 40</p>
<p>Yunnan 90 Tianjin 40</p>
<p>Shantou 345 Total 1,375</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market opened sharply lower and continued to decline, mainly due to a lack of spot sales. In the afternoon, profit-takers covered their short positions, causing a rebound, but the result was still 1 to 2 yuan weaker than the previous day. The price of 20-count Yueqin yarn was 360 to 361 yuan.</p>
<p>North China Forcibly Plants Cotton　Taicang Cotton Source Obstructed　Local Market Becomes a World of Foreign Cotton　Brazilian Cotton Continues to Be Ordered at 5,000 Bales　Margin Still Calculated at 20%</p>
<p>Recently, Chinese cotton has been completely stagnant, with various sources blocked and interrupted. Local inventories are dwindling daily. However, Changshu and Taicang still have 20 to 30% of cotton in stock, which could be transported to Shanghai for sale at a good price. However, the roads are unsafe, and traders regard it as a perilous undertaking, and they can only sell it to local Litai yarn factories at low prices. Pudong also has 20% of local-machine-processed cotton in stock, which occasionally comes to Shanghai, but various expenses are enormous, and the cost is not light. Cotton merchants are particularly worried about the situation of this year's new cotton. However, according to a certain source, within 15 li of the railway line in North China,</p>
<p>The local cotton business has been suspended for two days, and yesterday it was slightly active, but factories still show no sign of purchasing. This is because the Indian cotton ordered in the past has now arrived in Shanghai in large quantities, and the factories have more than enough for weft use. However, in the past two days, the price of Indian cotton blocks has risen, resulting in higher devalued prices. Therefore, although local cotton transactions are sluggish, the selling price tends to rise. Two transactions were made by fellow traders, totaling 200 bales of Xia Sha cotton, settled at 70 yuan with a draft, and 70 bales of Tongzhou cotton at 77.6 yuan settled with a draft. The supply from northern Jiangsu is still not strong, with 518 bales of Tongzhou cotton arriving.</p>
<p>Also, it is reported that yesterday, cotton firms and factories ordered a large amount of Brazilian cotton, all of which are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai in July and August. The reason is that the Indian cotton ordered by various parties in the past has already arrived, but it is said that they do not match the previous samples. Therefore, the move to purchase Brazilian cotton has suddenly become popular.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market opened higher due to purchases by spot merchants, favorable telegrams from Bombay, and firm prices for May contracts. However, it weakened later due to some reactionary selling, profit-taking by bulls, and falling telegrams from Liverpool. Washington has not yet made a clear statement on loan cotton, and fellow traders generally adopt a wait-and-see attitude. Sales of linen in April turned brisk, increasing to 547,000 bales, an increase of 135,000 bales compared to the same period last year. Yesterday, New York fell by about 10 points. India surged by 3 rupees, and Egypt rose by more than 30 points. Converted to legal tender, US cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 8 jiao per dan, while Indian cotton and Egyptian cotton rose by more than 1 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton transactions: Yesterday, various foreign cotton firms stated that factories could be flexible with the down payment for ordering foreign cotton. Fellow traders increased the margin to 30%. After arguing on reasonable grounds yesterday, it was decided that the margin for fellow traders' orders would still be calculated at 20%. Therefore, although there were no transactions by various factories yesterday, fellow traders ordered Brazilian cotton quite vigorously. Another 5,000 bales were transacted yesterday, priced at 86 to 87 yuan. The converted delivery prices to factories for yesterday's cotton market are as follows:</p>

<p>The market is sluggish, and the selling prices of various goods are difficult to standardize due to too many retailers and a chaotic market. The opening prices differ by 1 to 3 or 4 jiao per piece. Yesterday, spot sales to customers were clear, but some colored goods from Shantou, although shipments were postponed, colored twill fabrics were urged for shipment by telegram. More than 100 cases were purchased. Wenzhou continued to purchase 50 to 60 pieces of coarse cloth and fine cloth. Local dyeing factories purchased more than 100 bales of fine twill and more than 60 bales of coarse twill. The wholesale business of local wholesale houses to mainland customers is still continuous. Several thousand pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, poplin, linen gauze, and satin were transacted to various places in Anhui and northern Jiangsu. The futures transactions of grey fabrics and autumn goods by local wholesale houses and dyeing factories are even more sluggish due to the tense local situation and anxious hearts.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>Fine cloth and fine twill were sluggish yesterday due to poor customer sales, and large traders also started to sell off. Sentiment was depressed, and the price decline was rapid. In the morning market, the opening price of Longtou and Caiqiu brand fine cloth was 13.65 yuan. Later, local dyeing factories took advantage of the low prices to replenish their stock, purchasing 600 to 700 pieces of spot goods, causing the price to rise back to 13.75 yuan. 12-pound Feiyu fine cloth spot goods were particularly high, requiring 13.85 yuan, while warehouse receipts were only 13.7 yuan. Fine twill went down even further. Yanghe fine twill has fallen to 12.85 yuan, and Baobei is only 12.05 yuan.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>On the 16th, 64 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Hong Kong, and on the 17th, 80 pieces were shipped to Xiamen, 65 pieces to Shantou, and 35 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>

<p>Yesterday's spot flour market was completely unchanged at 4.55 yuan in cash. Northern merchants, observing the opening of "Huaxing" Bank, were somewhat hesitant, so purchases were even quieter. Southern merchants were also sluggish due to the impact of the war. Relying only on daily needs of local streets and sporadic additions from mainland merchants, total transactions were less than 30,000 bags. Although factories have seen increased production, customer sales are difficult to expand for the time being, so they can only maintain the original price and wait for an opportunity to change. However, mixed brands floating on the market continue to be sold at discounted prices, and the market is particularly scattered. 1,500 bags of flour were exported to Shantou today.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday's wheat market became quiet again. It is noted that recent supplies have gradually arrived in port, but the quantity is not large. Factories are less interested because foreign wheat orders will soon arrive in Shanghai. Sellers are unwilling to compromise too much because the sales market in North China is still good, so both sides seem to be holding their positions. As a result, there were few transactions in the formal market. It is heard that the delivery price to factories is only 6.1 to 6.2 yuan, and the market still shows a tired state.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat</p>
<p>Another shipment arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Ridley, managed by Jardine Matheson, from Australia, totaling 8,586 tons, of which 161 tons have been packed into 2,498 bags. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow. The berthing location has not yet been decided because there is no space in the wharves along the Huangpu River recently. (Ancestor)</p>

The annual sales volume is generally more than 20,000 tons. Fluctuations in market prices can greatly affect the wire nail market. Therefore, local nail manufacturers are paying close attention to the market situation of this commodity. Recently, due to the strong sales of wire nails in Tianjin, tens of thousands of barrels of futures have been released, which has also led to the development of wire rod sales. The standard price has risen from 15 yuan to 16 yuan, and there is no spot available recently. Therefore, the asking price in the market even requires 16.5 yuan.</p>

<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>Since ancient times, China has had persuaders who specialized in using their eloquence to obtain high positions. This shows that the effect of eloquence is very significant. In addition to being able to become an official, eloquence also has the following effects:</p>
<p>To avoid being wronged. Some people are often able to enter and exit vast armies, but when faced with others, they stutter and cannot say a word, suffering the bitterness of being wronged. People with eloquence are different. No matter how many people argue with them, they can handle it with ease and gain victory. Zhuge Liang's debate with the Confucian scholars is a good example.</p>
<p>To resolve people's crises. "One word is worth nine tripods," and "a promise is worth a thousand pieces of gold" speak of the power of language. However, if words are spoken skillfully, they can also help people out of trouble. Xie Daoyun's rescue of "Young Master" is another example.</p>
<p>Now, the use of eloquence is even more extensive. The reason is that all citizens should be concerned about national affairs and social affairs, and everywhere requires speeches or discussions. Confucius' "speech" subject has now become a required subject in various schools. The so-called "speech meetings" and "debating clubs" are all organizations for practicing eloquence. Now that the country is in a time of trouble, it is imperative to promote the various matters of resisting Japan and saving the country with eloquence.</p>
<p>However, where there is benefit, there must be harm, which is a common rule from ancient times to the present. But it seems undeniable that the disadvantages of eloquence outweigh the advantages:</p>
<p>Lying is the negative effect of eloquence. Lying requires eloquence, otherwise listeners will not believe it. An eloquent liar can indeed make it sound flowery and rain-like, bringing the dead back to life. As for deceiving and killing one or two people without having to pay with one's life, that is indeed a common occurrence. Today's so-called bragging can also be included in the category of lying, because what is being bragged about is unfounded and absurd, coming from the same source as lies.</p>
<p>Flattery is another negative effect of eloquence. Even if one has the heart to suck up, without the eloquence to do so, the flattery will surely be aimed at the horse's foot. Like a wealthy man in the late Qing Dynasty who praised a certain Grand Secretary by saying, "I have long admired your lord for being cunning and treacherous, feared by the court and the public." Those who are good at flattery must say to the person they are flattering, "I know you don't like flattery." The person will surely be overjoyed and leave, considering them a confidant.</p>
<p>Therefore, although Confucius established a "speech specialization department" in his "Apricot Altar University," he hated those who were good at speaking, calling them "sycophants." He bluntly rebuked, "Those who argue with others with their mouths are often hated by others. What use is there for sycophancy!" When he executed Shao Zhengmao in a fit of anger, one of Shao Zhengmao's crimes was "false and specious words."</p>
<p>In addition, Emperor Taizu of Song's handling of Xu Xuan was also a great delight. It is said that Xu Xuan represented the Southern Tang to negotiate tribute regulations. Because of his skill in rhetoric, no one could be found to deal with him for a time. Later, Emperor Taizu of Song personally chose an illiterate "attendant" official, and the following was the result: "At first, Xuan's rhetoric was like clouds, and the onlookers were shocked. The attendant could not answer and could only say yes. Xuan was perplexed, and insisted on speaking to him. After a few days, there was no reply, and Xuan was tired and bored!"</p>
<p>However, the "subject" of eloquence also includes the "cursing" system. I don't know if this is considered proper or improper. Because when it comes to cursing, everyone has a kind of aversion in their hearts, thinking that at least it is an impolite expression, an insult to others, and an act of self-degradation. Thus, village women cursing neighbors and drunkards cursing from their seats are listed as vices in life. However, when we see Zhuge Liang cursing Wang Lang to death, we feel a burst of joy in our hearts. When Jiao Da cursed the Rongning mansions, saying that only the stone lions were clean, we couldn't help but agree with him. How can this not make us slap the table and praise, "Well cursed! Well cursed!"</p>
<p>It turns out that cursing is by no means something that comes out of nowhere without any feeling. True cursing is by no means a superior scolding subordinates or a boss scolding employees, just venting their anger and showing off their power. It is always because the heart can't bear it that they pour out everything they have. Such cursing is often a brilliant piece of oral writing, eloquence. In ancient times, there were loyal officials who knocked out their teeth and cut off their tongues, spitting blood to their death for the sake of their country. There were also old prostitutes who cursed the bandits naked to relieve the siege of the city. There are many such examples.</p>
<p>In conclusion, if our eloquence cannot be used well for the right path, to avoid being wronged and to relieve people's crises, nor can it be misused for the wrong path, lying and flattering, I think we should still use it for the neither right nor wrong path, choosing those who deserve to be cursed today, and cursing them heartily until they have no way to go to heaven and no way to enter the earth!</p>
<h3 id="e130">Selling Soybeans (Part 2) <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>— Ming Xiao</p>
<p>"Haha, that's right, I saw you when you were little." She showed the expression of someone meeting an acquaintance in a foreign land. "You've always been outside, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I've always been working in this silk cocoon guild."</p>
<p>Then she asked him many questions about the cocoon guild, and he asked her some questions about coming to this town to sell soybeans. The more they talked, the warmer they became, just like relatives. The only difference was that he was sitting, and she was standing, indicating that one was drinking tea and the other was doing business.</p>
<p>"You feel very good now, right?" She changed the subject and asked this question in a low voice.</p>
<p>"That's hard to say..." His voice was also low.</p>
<p>"Jin Gen!" After they had been talking for a long time, someone was calling from downstairs. He stood up to prepare to leave, answering "Coming!" while reaching into his pocket to take out money.</p>
<p>"Let's settle it tomorrow, I still have a few days to stay." The old lady quickly stopped him.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's settle it tomorrow." Jin Gen went downstairs.</p>
<p>The next day, he did eat her soybeans again, and talked to her for a long time. When he went downstairs, she still didn't want him to take out money, still saying, "Let's settle it tomorrow."</p>
<p>However, when he came to this teahouse on this "tomorrow," he could not find her shadow. He thought that she might come again tomorrow, so he didn't take it to heart.</p>
<p>But she never came to this teahouse again, because she had already returned to her home.</p>
<p>When we saw her return, there was not one who did not express welcome.</p>
<p>"There's good news to bring back, everyone listen!" Wang Mingyuan shouted first.</p>
<p>"There's no good news," the old lady said as she placed the cloth bag from her eyebrow on the table. "There are still some soybeans left here, which you can eat."</p>
<p>"What? Where did these kinds of soybeans come from?" Everyone saw the soybeans that had been poured on the table.</p>
<p>"Leftover from selling."</p>
<p>"You went to sell soybeans? Then what about the news?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I forgot," she said in feigned surprise. "I only knew about selling soybeans, but I forgot the important matter."</p>
<p>"Tell us, tell us." Everyone knew she was joking.</p>
<p>"Really forgot. You separate these soybeans and count them, maybe I'll remember." Everyone didn't understand what she meant, but believed that she must have a reason, so they did as she said, sorting them one by one.</p>
<p>"How many grains of 'sand soybeans' are there?" she asked.</p>
<p>"The least, only three."</p>
<p>"Then I'll tell you: there are at least only three small cannons."</p>
<p>"Oh!" Everyone understood at this point, and exhaled in unison.</p>
<p>"What about 'soaked beans'?"</p>
<p>"Six grains."</p>
<p>"That's heavy machine guns."</p>
<p>After that, there were fourteen grains of "five-spice beans," light machine guns; one hundred and eighteen grains of "sprouted beans," rifles.</p>
<p>"And what are the one hundred and eighty-two grains of 'hu su beans'?" Finally, Wang Mingyuan couldn't wait to ask.</p>
<p>"Is that still necessary to say?" the old lady smiled. "What else do we need to know besides guns and cannons?"</p>
<p>"Damn it," Wang Mingyuan also laughed. "I was so confused."</p>
<p>The old lady rearranged the various soybeans on the table, pointing to the piles of soybeans and saying to everyone:</p>
<p>"This is stationed in the Wulongyuan bathhouse at the East Zhaikou; this is stationed in the Public Cocoon Guild in the city; this is..."</p>
<p>She spoke and pointed clearly, leaving a deep impression in everyone's minds, as if they had personally seen it in Qingzhen.</p>
<p>"Now you really eat these soybeans." she said after she finished speaking.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll eat the machine gun!"</p>
<p>"I'll eat..."</p>
<p>In an atmosphere of laughter, every last soybean on the table was eaten. However, the things these soybeans represented had already been recorded by someone else, and the soybeans were indeed useless.</p>
<p>A few days later, the Shanghai newspapers had detailed records of Qingzhen being recaptured once, and also had the names of Wang Mingyuan and others, but no one thought of the old lady. Who would believe that the old lady who sold soybeans would have anything to do with this matter? Even Li Jingen is still wondering why she doesn't come to settle the soybean money with him!</p>

<p>— Liu You</p>
<p>Here we are, inside a prison, in a cage. Although we have legs that could take us away from this place we don't want to stay, we hesitate because there's no road!</p>
<p>The road enables humans to survive, preventing them from falling into despair. The road grants humans freedom, freeing them from the shackles of chains.</p>
<p>With a road, we fear no darkness, no obstacles. We can advance, we can distance ourselves from unfavorable situations!</p>
<p>Everyone in the world cherishes roads, especially the path of light. Countless people hope for it, long for it.</p>
<p>However, roads are man-made. They are not like towering peaks, vast rivers, or all the plants, insects, fish, birds, beasts, and people that are natural, or possess the magical power of a creator!</p>
<p>Our ancestors, for the sake of survival, for the sake of freedom and liberation, and even more so for not wanting to abandon this world, created countless roads, for their own use or to leave for their descendants.</p>
<p>The giant wheel of time has given us roads that have been built into a vast "number," allowing us to proceed comfortably.</p>
<p>However, on these roads, there are countless enemies of humanity. They will create many obstacles and inflict much destruction, plunging us into the abyss of darkness.</p>
<p>Now is the time for us to exert our strength, without hesitation, to resist and attack them, to reclaim this path of light!</p>
<p>The countless roads yet to be explored can lead us to even brighter lands. We should use all our spirit and power to open up new roads!</p>
<p>We are a group of road workers, and also a group of travelers. Before long, we will sing songs of triumph!</p>
<h3 id="e133">(3) Our Spiritual Leader <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Our leader recently gave a broadcast speech on "General Mobilization of the National Spirit," in which there were several very alarming lessons that can serve as our guiding principles for life from now on. He said: "We must strengthen the fortress of our spirit. A person must be loyal to the country, filial to the nation, benevolent to suffering compatriots, faithful to all humanity, and strive with all their strength to seek true and lasting peace in this turbulent and dim world." This means that we must restore our inherent morality, unleash our spiritual strength, and then strive for valuable careers to make contributions to the country and society.</p>
<p>To mold our spiritual lives and unleash our spiritual strength, we must have a leader who transcends the past and present, serving as our spiritual backing. Who is this person? It is Jesus Christ, who sacrificed himself to save the world!</p>
<p>Throughout his life of struggle, Jesus Christ constantly awakened the spirit of his compatriots in order to break free from the oppression of evil forces and restore the freedom of his homeland. At the same time, regardless of nationality, he wanted to transform humanity's sinful life and achieve a state of holiness, ultimately fulfilling his responsibility by sacrificing his own life. Therefore, Jesus has truly been loyal to the country, filial to the nation, benevolent to suffering compatriots, and faithful to all humanity. His spirit of sacrifice and love, and his sublime and outstanding personality, are not only more than sufficient to be our spiritual leader, but can also serve as a model for all ages. Dear compatriots! May you be able to recognize him!</p>

<p>— Editor</p>
<p>We have now received a letter from Mr. Liu You, who wishes to donate the manuscript fees for the two articles, "On the Mountain Peak" published in this journal on April 21st and "Drunk" published on April 27th, as funds for a charity sale. Mr. Liu You's enthusiasm is worthy of praise. We hope that all fellow writers can also rise up together and do their utmost to contribute to the country with their literary power.</p>
<h3 id="e135">"Charity Sale" and "Charity Gift" <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>— Ding San</p>
<p>Recently, students from a certain school sewed handkerchiefs, tied paper flowers, and held a "charity sale to donate funds." This shows that young students are not without ways to serve the country. Doing small-scale production, small-scale charity sales, and small-scale donations like this is also a way to serve the country; it is not necessary to go to the front lines to wave flags and shout slogans.</p>
<p>Previously, the students of Class A of a certain school (a total of more than forty people) raised more than sixty yuan and bought eighteen dozen pairs of black socks. One Sunday afternoon, they walked a long distance to the Isolated Army camp to express their sympathy. When buying the socks, the sock factory owner heard that they were going to comfort the Isolated Army, and that the Isolated Army was in need of socks (which they knew after writing to inquire), so he added two dozen pairs as a gift, making a total of twenty dozen. These students who dug into their own pockets to buy socks to comfort the troops can be said to be making a "charity gift," and the sock factory owner who added socks as a gift is naturally also making a "charity gift." Why make a "charity gift"? It is because the three hundred or so Isolated Army soldiers fought to the death to defend the country's territory, bled to protect the national flag, and will certainly be able to fight for the country again in the future. In short, it is for the sake of "saving the country."</p>
<p>In the past two months, I have "charitably bought" and also "charitably gifted"; but because of trivial matters and mental stagnation, coupled with fever and headaches, I have not been able to properly pick up my pen to do business, so I have not followed the "Cultural Workers' Charity Sale Movement," and I feel very ashamed. However, I have made four or five article "charity gifts" to the publications and wall newspapers run by the students. Such a "charity gift" that doesn't seem to be related to the country actually has a considerable relationship—for the sake of a special influence, even if it is a very small part of the influence!</p>
<p>A "charity sale" is a complete "donation," then those who "charitably buy" should also have a "silent donation" mentality, and not dislike the roughness of the goods, but should generously spare a few more dollars.</p>
<p>As for "charity gifts," giving money and giving things are naturally good, but giving strength and giving spirit are also not bad. As long as it is beneficial to the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, then no matter what you give, no matter who you give it to, it is good. For people like me who can't make ends meet, to be honest, although I can't give a lot of money and things, I can certainly continue to give strength and spirit.</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, many soldiers have given away their flesh and blood, and their lives, and contributed them to the country. Those who have not died after them, as well as those who have extra strength, extra spirit, extra money, and those who are lucky enough to make a fortune in the War of Resistance, if they are still unwilling to make "charity gifts," then can they still be considered citizens of China? Wouldn't they be ashamed!</p>
<p>Therefore, I advocate that the "charity sale" and fund-raising movement should be expanded and continued, but further, we should intensify, expand, and promote the movement of "charity gifting" to donate funds, donate goods, donate strength, and donate spirit!</p>
<p>Everyone, let's rise up for the War of Resistance and national reconstruction, through charity sales and "charity gifts!" (Charity Sale Donation)</p>

<p>(Seen in the May issue of this newspaper during the Tongzhi era of Emperor Xunji)</p>
<p>Shanghai is located on the coast, near the riverbank, and the residents of the city benefit from the ebb and flow of the tide. However, the city river is shallow and narrow, especially with the excessive dumping of garbage along the riverbanks. When the tide comes in, the entire canal is filled with filth, forming toxic currents. Wealthy gentlemen and merchants are capable of hiring water carriers to fetch water from the source. The poorest are the impoverished residents in remote corners of the city. When the tide rises, they compete to draw what is almost like a few liters of black ink. Their illnesses, such as plague, epidemics, cholera, and poisoning, are all due to drinking this water. In the past, local officials were not without the intention to dredge the river, but it cost thousands of dollars, and within one or two years, the silt would still clog the river. Now, the honorable magistrate Ye has manufactured an iron-machine boat to transport the mud, which is both convenient and cost-effective. This is a good method and a good intention, unprecedented. Residents drink the water of his harmony and eat the fruit of his virtue; every drop is given by him. Therefore, today, the people of Shanghai unanimously praise him as a living Buddha for ten thousand families because of the river dredging.</p>

<p>I was leisurely walking towards the outside of the Xiaodongmen, when I reached the front of the Nandangui Tea Garden, and suddenly saw a crowd of people, noisy like people watching the tide on the riverbank or watching a play at the temple fair. I was curious and asked about it. I learned that an actor, a native of Tianjin, went to a pawnshop to redeem a blanket, and a dispute arose over changing a few dozen coins. The shop owner was a native of Chaoyang, Guangdong, and had a stubborn temperament, so he dared to act violently and throw a bowl, injuring the actor's head, causing blood to flow all over his face. They started fighting each other, like Lu Bu fighting three heroes. The destruction of property and the fight temporarily stopped. Then, the counterattack came, and the shop owner gathered his gang, acting like wolves and tigers, carrying double knives and dancing wildly in the street. The Tianjin people, seeing that they were no match, sent a message to invite their colleagues from the Beidangui Tea Garden, who also took short knives and soft sticks to confront them. The onlookers were horrified! Both sides were tall and strong, and neither side would give up, like a scene from "Havoc in Heaven." Although there were a dozen or so police officers, they could not suppress them. Everyone who fought each other bled, and they were all seriously injured. They were all taken to the police station to await trial.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Shanghai West Community Center <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>Dedicated to serving the working masses. Offers vocational supplementary schools.</p>
<p>A corner of western Shanghai, a section of Robison Road, a place commonly known as "Big Ben," is very lively. Although it is a working-class area, in terms of the market, there is a post office, a jewelry store, and some larger silk and satin shops, tea and snack shops... In short, among the roads in the western part of Shanghai, this place can be considered the most unique and lively. No matter what day we go there, we can always see colorful flags fluttering with huge price cuts, and foreign copper drums and foreign trumpets attracting customers. However, what I want to introduce in this article is not the market situation there, but an organization that serves the ranks of the working class - the Shanghai West Community Center.</p>
<p>The Shanghai West Community Center echoes the Shanghai East Community Center from afar, both being organizations that serve the working masses. One is in western Shanghai, and the other is in eastern Shanghai. The Shanghai West Community Center was established by the YMCA because the YMCA realized that the western part of Shanghai, especially the area near Robison Road, has many factories and many shantytown areas everywhere, with many workers concentrated there, lacking organizations to promote proper entertainment and popularize labor education, so it established a Shanghai West Community Center near Big Ben. Since its establishment, it has a considerable history now.</p>
<p>The scale is very small, and the venue is not very large. When we walk on Robison Road, pass Big Ben, and walk a few steps to the west, we suddenly find a bamboo fence at the entrance in a row of shops, with a horizontal plaque with the four large characters "Shanghai West Community Center," and a sign with "Vocational Supplementary Morning and Evening School" hanging next to it. That is the Shanghai West Community Center. Looking inside the bamboo fence, a not very large playground has basketball hoops and small football goals, which is the Shanghai West Community Center's sports field. Further inside is a rectangular, egg-shaped house nailed together with wooden boards, like a barracks, which serves as the Shanghai West Community Center's office, classrooms, reading room, and other facilities.</p>
<p>The Shanghai West Community Center's scope of work is also very broad, and the center of its activities, as mentioned above, is aimed at laborers. In terms of moral education: a pastor preaches every week; in terms of intellectual education: a vocational supplementary school is set up, divided into morning and evening classes, so that the working masses in the western part of Shanghai can use their spare time to take various lessons: in terms of physical education: regardless of children or adults, they can often be seen kicking balls and doing various sports there. Various daily newspapers are also available for people to read, and books are lent out.</p>
<p>In addition to these regular facilities and activities, before "August 13th," various exhibitions were often held there. Like the health exhibition: it should be held every year in the summer to arouse the attention of the general working masses to summer health and to impart health knowledge. Therefore, when we occasionally walked past there, especially on holidays, we would always see many people exercising or reading and reading newspapers inside. The Shanghai West Community Center in the western Shanghai working-class area is indeed needed, I think.</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Dark Side of Banks <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiuwu</p>
<p>Numerous items such as bounced check fines, handling fees, and book fees.</p>
<p>After depositing 13 yuan and some cents for two years, some money still needs to be returned.</p>
<p>In the past, banks and money houses were very careful with external loans, requiring introducers and guarantors for ordinary stores in addition to reliable merchants. If the trading firms had any errors or incidents, they would be severely reprimanded. Therefore, ordinary stores referred to money houses and banks as "old bosses."</p>
<p>In recent years, many banks have suddenly emerged in the market, advertising extensively in newspapers, not only not requiring guarantors and introducers, but only needing fifty or twenty yuan to open an account. There were also large gifts and extra wallets. Because of such preferential treatment and publicity, before August 13th, a friend of mine who opened a grocery store in Liangbei deposited fifty yuan and started doing business with a certain bank that had been established for a relatively long time.</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the August 13th incident, my friend's store was completely destroyed, but after calculating the ledger of the bank, there was still more than thirteen yuan and some cents left. So he took the ledger to the bank to withdraw the balance, preparing it as travel expenses for escaping. The bank clerk said: By government order, during the War of Resistance, withdrawals are prohibited. (In fact, the Ministry of Finance only ordered that this restriction applied to deposits of 300 yuan or more.) My friend thought this was a government order and should be obeyed, so he borrowed from the east and west and fled back to his hometown of Jiangdu.</p>
<p>In February of this year, my friend returned to Shanghai, and his life as a refugee was very miserable, so he took the two-year-old passbook again, wanting to withdraw the money from the bank. The clerk flipped through the ledger, moved the abacus beads, raised his face, and said to my friend: The deposit is gone, according to the calculation, I still need to find a few cents from you, everyone is old business, let's just muddle through!</p>
<p>My friend was completely confused when he heard the clerk's answer, wondering: how can there be such a thing as depositing money and paying interest instead! Suspecting that the clerk had made a mistake in the account, he took out the passbook and showed it to the clerk, who patiently replied again, the account is correct, your money was left over before August 13th, our regulations here require handling fees, book fees, and bill posting fees for deposits, you haven't come to withdraw it for two or three years, it has long been offset by these miscellaneous fees. My friend was, after all, an old Shanghainese, knew the situation in Shanghai society, knew that when fish fall into the cat's mouth, there is nothing to say, asked him for a detailed account, and ran out panting.</p>
<p>My friend told me this and that. But I didn't believe it at all. But as luck would have it, I accidentally met a friend who worked in a money house, so I reported these things to him. He laughed without thinking and said to me: There are many people in Shanghai who know how to do business! You see, countless frugal merchants who have no introduction and guarantee feel the pain of not having financial dealings, now, suddenly there are banks that do not require guarantee and introduction, only need thirty or fifty yuan to open an account, and can receive checks for business, who is not willing, who does not welcome it? So, deposits are paid in, checks are received, fifteen thousand, you can freely write out, how pleasant! When the check is due, the money cannot be raised, and it is naturally inevitable to have a bounced check. The bank owner saw this weakness, so he grandly said: In order to limit bounced checks, each bounced check will be fined three corners. For example, if the average daily bounced check amount of this bank is about 300, each check is fined three corners, and the daily bounced check income will be 90 yuan, which is more than enough to cover expenses. Others, although no money has been spent, still require bill posting and handling fees, and there are even more items, which are endless. Therefore, the profits of a certain bank last year were amazing, no wonder it aroused the envy of its peers, so, this year, there are several more banks in the market.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Impossible Things <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— Buddha</p>
<p>Of all things in the world, some can be bought with money, and some cannot be bought with money, such as England's willingness to lend Spain 100 million US dollars to keep it neutral, this is definitely impossible. Not only 100 million US dollars, but even several 100 million US dollars, I am afraid it cannot be done, why? Spain still has its backstage boss. The anti-aggression group organization, the Soviet Union gave England an answer of mutual guarantee, that is, after the Soviet Union provides guarantees to England, England must also provide guarantees, this is fair. Rights and obligations are relative, there is no obligation without rights, and no rights without obligations, if you see through this point, it will be easy to do.</p>

<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 10: A Mother with a Chignon and Blue Skirt is Virtuous and Good, An Old Man with Silver Whiskers and Green Sleeves is Robust.</p>
<p>They all arrived in front of the thatched cottage of the village head Zhu, and the village head Zhu also welcomed them to the steps. When the two Miss He looked up, they saw that the village head Zhu was wearing a blue cloth robe, with a bald head with white sideburns, his face red and black, his kind appearance was amiable, and his silver whiskers fluttered on his chest, hanging straight to his abdomen. One arm was gone, but the sleeve was still there, floating empty there. At a glance, one could tell that he was a kind old man, and the two Miss He hurriedly stepped forward to bow and pay their respects. The village head Zhu said with a smile: "I heard Ai Ren say that the two ladies were her best classmates in the United States. It is rare to come to our place. Our small village is really barren and humble, and not worth seeing. The two ladies come to our village, but they are very slow, what should I do?" According to the customs of Jiangsu, the parents of classmates are called uncle and aunt. The grandparents of classmates are called grandfather and grandmother. Now the two Miss He are two generations younger than the village head Zhu, and they should also be called grandfather. Also, because they and Ai Ren are as close as siblings, it is as if Ai Ren's grandfather is their grandfather, so they also call him grandfather. For Mrs. Zhu, they should call her aunt, and sometimes they also call her mother, to show their intimacy. At this time, they were invited to sit down at the thatched cottage of the village head Zhu, and Mrs. Zhu was about to go to the kitchen to arrange a good meal for the guests. Ai Ren also wanted to help her mother, but Mrs. Zhu pushed her away with a smile and said: "Miss, you can't do it. If you come to help me, it will really be more of a hindrance than a help. You be a good girl and go and accompany the guests!" Zhu Ai Ren also knew that she really couldn't help. Frying an egg was more difficult than delivering a difficult birth. Opening a carp's belly was more difficult than opening a person's belly. She had no choice but to go back to accompany the He sisters and her old father, and chat with them. Talking about their problem of looking for a factory site, the village head Zhu said: "There is a location, naturally it must be a place with convenient water and land transportation. After lunch, we will go there to take a look. Now all the land is owned by the village, and whoever wants to open a factory can rent it from the village. And the lease period, twenty years is fine, thirty years is fine. Generally, it is twenty years, because the world is progressing very fast now. The ancient Chinese book said: 'Thirty years is a generation,' at this moment, thirty years will have great changes. Many people have come to our free village to look for a location, ready to open a factory. But we are also very cautious, some can be agreed to, and some cannot be agreed to." (112)</p>
<h3 id="e142">"One Year" Performed in Chongqing <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Xueying</p>
<p>Hong Kong Will Also Stage the Play to Raise Funds for the National Salvation Daily</p>
<p>"One Year" is a new four-act play written by Xia Yan. This play was written for Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and others to go abroad to raise funds for the Fifth Army's wounded soldier factories and other purposes. Mr. Xia Yan, who presides over the National Salvation Daily, is already very busy, but because this matter was important, and Jin Shan and others were worried that there was no new script to perform, they repeatedly urged him to write it in his busy schedule.</p>
<p>Although the play was rushed out in his busy schedule, the fact that "One Year" is an outstanding new realistic play is still unanimously acknowledged. There is not a single formulaic national salvation face in the play, but it is overflowing with a strong atmosphere of confidence and optimism for the victory of the War of Resistance. The characterization and the clever and moving ending are even greater reasons why this play has become an outstanding work. It is expected that when this play is staged in the United States, it will make the American people understand more clearly that China is strong and unyielding, which will be no problem.</p>
<p>It is said that in addition to Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and others performing this play in the United States, in Chongqing, the funds were also performed at the Guotai Theater, and with Chen Rong's hall, the business was very good. The ticket price for the honorary seat was fifty yuan per seat, but the result was still full, and even the glass windows were broken. Wang Jinsheng, who was in charge of the front desk, wore his colonel's uniform, but the result was still unable to maintain order in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>This public performance was to raise funds for the National Salvation Daily, and the profit after settlement was more than 7,000 yuan. The performance of Chen Rong was extremely solid: the director was Ying Yunwei; the actor Zhao Dan played the strong and righteous old man Liu Aiyu, Bai Yang played the bride, Shu Xiuwen played the aunt Xiu Sheng, Wang Weiyi played the failure theorist Ming Yang, Ying Yin played a national salvation member Yu Zhihua who lived in a pavilion, and other roles, such as Defang, A Peng, etc., were also the best of the time, which can be seen from the fact that Bai Yang only played a newly married woman with few scenes. As for the background of the play, the first two acts are in a small station along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, and the third and fourth acts are in Shanghai after the fall of Chongqing.</p>
<p>In addition to Chongqing, I recently received news that someone in Hong Kong is preparing to perform it, and the proceeds will also be donated to the National Salvation Daily. (Charity Sale Donation)</p>

<h3 id="e143">About Liu Baoquan <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Tang</p>
<p>If Chinese music holds a position in the world music scene, then Liu Baoquan undoubtedly should be regarded as one of the genius musicians. Because the rhythm used in his storytelling performance has fully incorporated the twelve equal temperament (that is, each "jun" is divided into twelve equally tempered semitones), which is completely consistent with the equal temperament adopted by modern Western music. This is something that all other Chinese music does not possess. And he uses his singing voice to skillfully utilize the twelve temperaments, performing narration, description, commentary, lyricism, and jokes while singing a certain story. At the same time, he uses his eyes, gestures, and even inner emotions to express the expressions and dialogues of various characters in the story, as well as the arrangement and dynamics of different things. This kind of magical skill of melting himself and the audience completely into music and story is also unique throughout history, both in China and abroad, and is solely created by this great artist.</p>
<p>Several familiar story-telling pieces, such as "Ning Wu Guan," "Changban Slope," "Huarong Road," "Visiting the Wu Temple," "Wulong Courtyard," "Disturbing Jiangzhou," and "Ma'anshan," each has its own unique style and indescribably simple and beautiful techniques. In terms of consciousness, "Ning Wu Guan" can be said to be the highest peak of his artistic expression. In this play, you can hear how this old artist, with the accompaniment of three strings, tells the story of the turmoil caused by the rebel Li Zicheng at the end of the Ming Dynasty, the defeat of General Zhou Yuji, his visit to his mother to celebrate her birthday, forcing himself to laugh, his virtuous mother seeing through his hidden feelings, urging him to uphold righteousness, saying goodbye to his mother to go on the expedition, his beautiful wife committing suicide, his beloved son being knocked to death, his virtuous mother immolating herself, the righteous servant throwing himself into the fire, and Zhou Yuji fighting fiercely against Li Zicheng and dying from a rain of arrows. This is a great national story that combines loyal ministers, filial sons, righteous servants, and chaste women, shocking heaven and earth and moving gods. When he performs the emotions of each character in the story, as well as the tragic and intense emotions between mother and son, husband and wife, father and son, and master and servant, everyone in the audience is deeply moved and wipes away tears. On the stage, his heart, eyes, hands, and body are all in sync with the plot, and every word is in sync with the rhythm. His musical notation divides the notes into even sixteenths. He uses his beautiful singing voice, which is complete in the five tones and combines strength and tenderness, to glide naturally from one tone to another, while intentionally or unintentionally manipulating those complex and astonishing notes (called "shua ban" in old operas, but the difference between complexity and simplicity is like heaven and earth). If not for a highly trained musician, it would be simply impossible to identify where the notes and rhythms are. Art to this point has reached perfection.</p>
<p>On the second day of Liu Baoquan's performance, he said to the audience with emotion: "My first performance in Shanghai was more than ten years ago, at the New World. The second was three years ago, at the Great China. This is the third. As for the next time, I'm afraid I won't be able to do it at my age!" After he said this, although the audience responded with knowing smiles, I think most people, like me, would feel a pang of sadness after smiling.</p>
<p>Liu Baoquan is called the "King of Drum Storytelling," and it is very appropriate, because although drum storytelling was not created by him, this way of singing drum storytelling was indeed created by him. Every art is only made unprecedented by its creator, and only made unmatched by its creator. Therefore, I and all his art-loving friends praise him as an unprecedented and unmatched musician. The reason why our people do not value him is because they have not heard his unparalleled art. The reason why he has not been valued by the world is because he has not yet been discovered by the world. I feel extremely sad for this 71-year-old artist, who came all the way from the north to this isolated island for a meager performance fee that is barely enough to cover expenses, performing in a small theater and only having hundreds of knowledgeable listeners every day (in fact, there are still many who are just there for the excitement and do not truly appreciate his art). A month passes quickly, and this old musician will soon return to the ancient city that has already fallen into enemy hands. Although I silently wish him good health here, I can't help but feel extremely disappointed when I think that I will no longer be able to hear this kind of grand artistic sound.</p>
<p>Although many records of Liu Baoquan's drum storytelling have been collected before, I think records are not enough. In order to preserve Liu Baoquan's art—these national treasures—for future generations, it is necessary to film him and make a movie. Because his singing is only one-third of his art, and another third is his eyes and gestures, which must also be filmed. The remaining one-third is his inner performance, which cannot be preserved. I hope that film producers will accept my request and complete this great undertaking before the old man returns north. I believe that even if it costs a great price to make this film, it is worth it. Because these filmed films are no different from national treasures, and they will be priceless in the near future.</p>

<h3 id="e146">One of the Protagonists of the "Scandalous Tragedy" - Child Star Hao Xiaoyun <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>Speaking of Hao Xiaoyun, some people may ask, thinking that she is a newly emerging child star; in fact, she started acting as early as five years ago. She has appeared in early films such as "Big Family," "Good Luck," and "Zi Yan Girl," but none of them occupy an important position. Sometimes, she almost only shows her face, and doesn't even have the opportunity to speak, which is why she has been overlooked by the audience. Her original name is Genyun, and she started acting at the age of eight, so people in the film circle call her Hao Baobao. This year, she is a full eleven years old and studies at Shangxian Tang Primary School. Her father is from Beiping and can act. Influenced by her father, she speaks fluent Mandarin. She can sing, dance well, and also knows Beijing opera. She sings well, and it is said that playing the drums is also her specialty. Her face is like Hu Die, but without dimples, she cannot escape the immaturity of childhood. A certain film magazine once published her photo and praised her as the Shirley Temple of China. In terms of appearance, she can be regarded as one of the more beautiful child stars in China!</p>
<p>I believe that the success of a film worker depends half on their own talent and effort, and half on someone recognizing and promoting them. As far as Xiaoyun's performance in this film is concerned, undoubtedly a greater success lies before her, because as a child star who has not been valued by the film industry and the audience, once she takes on this important role and gives the audience a good impression, we cannot help but be surprised. Therefore, I hope that directors will give more guidance and exploration to talented child stars, perhaps they will bring a beautiful exotic flower to the film industry of this isolated island!</p>

<p>— Yan Yan</p>
<p>In recent years, Ma Lianliang has spared no effort in rehearsing old operas. The rehearsal of the play "Lintong Mountain" is almost complete and is expected to be performed publicly this month. "Lintong Mountain", "Qin Qiong's Merits", and "Striking Shi Lei with Lanterns" are all old operas that have been lost for a long time. Now that Lianliang has rehearsed them, his contribution to preserving old operas cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng is the one among the Four Great Dan actors who has created the most new operas. Recently, he has also expressed his desire to create an opera based on Qingwen and Xiren in "Dream of the Red Chamber." This year, he will temporarily bring the play "Qingwen" to the stage, and the rest will be worked on next year.</p>
<p>The Beijing Opera School has been working hard to rehearse new operas this year. After the public performance of "Three Women's Love," they re-staged "Maling Road" and "Flame Mountain." Last month, they premiered Gao (Qingkui)'s famous play "Yang Jiaoshan." They are currently engaged in the continued rehearsal of a good play, which is planned by Wu Fuqin, called "Marriage Robbery." The plot is very romantic and poignant, and the leading role has been determined to be played by the female student Hou Yulan.</p>
<p>Among the female Dan actors who imitate Xun (Huisheng) in Beiping, besides Liang Xiujuan, who has retired from the singing world, there is also Wu Suqiu. Wu performed Xun's play "Drifting Tears" at the Qing Le Theater on the evening of the 30th of last month, which was very popular with the audience. Li Yuru from the opera school has also made great progress in learning Xun recently, so a certain gentleman gave her the title of "Female White Peony".</p>
<p>In addition to using new monkey operas as a selling point in Ping, Li Wanchun also cooperates with Li Hongchun in singing Guan Gong operas, and sometimes even performs old male roles. He is truly a hard worker. Recently, he received an invitation from a theater in Shenyang, Liaoning, and led the Yongchun Society to set off on the 12th of this month. It is expected to be very popular.</p>
<p>Xu Lanyuan, Mei Lanfang's mentor, has long had the intention of organizing an opera troupe, but he has been unable to implement it for a long time. Recently, he has been working hard to prepare and has formed a small opera troupe. He teaches art privately, and the future path is to perform in various gardens with Lanyuan's son, Xu Zhendong.</p>
<p>Jin Shaoshan's voice has been gradually improving recently, and he will soon be able to officially take the stage to sing. He also plans to broadcast the play "Farewell My Concubine" with the famous female actress Xin Yanqiu on the radio. There is a possibility of it being realized.</p>
<p>The golden-voiced singing king "Little Caiwu" came to Ping from Tianjin and performed at the Ruiyuan Tea House, which was very popular among the people of Ping. The troupe includes Mei Hua Drum Jin Wanchang, Guo Rongshan, Gong Xiaoyun, Wang Peichen, and other miscellaneous talents. They will leave and return to Tianjin at the end of the month or so.</p>

<p>The Christian Service Corps of St. John's University, St. John's Middle School, and St. Mary's Girls' School originally planned to perform "Moon" day and night on the 20th and 21st of this month at the American Women's Association at 577 Jing'an Temple Road. Now, because the 21st is the Sabbath, the daytime performance on that day has been brought forward to 8:30 pm on the 18th, and the nighttime performance has been changed to 8:30 pm on the 19th, still at the original location.</p>
<h3 id="e150">"A Generation of Enchantresses" Special Issue <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Hong Kong Lianyi Film Company recently completed the Mandarin sound film "A Generation of Enchantresses," starring Li Li from Beiping. It is now approved to be screened at the Jincheng Grand Theater at the end of this month. Xia Weijiang is editing a special issue for it, with rich content in both text and pictures. Priced at 20 cents in national currency, it will be sold simultaneously at newspaper stands, cinemas, and bookstores on the 25th.</p>

<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Da Liwu's Mischief</p>
<p>Da Liwu's mischief is really too numerous to describe. The most amusing thing is his teasing of a certain young actor. It is said that once, a certain bearded actor was singing "Zhanzi at Yuanmen," and a certain young actor was playing Yang Zongbao, and Da Liwu was playing the Eighth Prince. When Zongbao was found guilty of proposing marriage without permission and was ordered by his father to be executed at Yuanmen, he sat on a chair at the edge of the stage with his hands tied behind his back (that is, his hands were reversed, making a gesture of being bound), unable to move. At this time, Jiao Erye (a supporting character) invited the Eighth Prince to come, hoping that their marshal would grant leniency and spare Zongbao's life. Unexpectedly, Yang and Zhao argued for a long time in Baihutang, but he was still not pardoned. The Eighth Prince had no choice but to walk up to Zongbao and comfort him. Who knew that Da Liwu had secretly smeared some sugar juice on his palms before going on stage. At this time, taking advantage of the moment of stroking and grieving, he smeared the sugar juice on Zongbao's face. It was the hot summer weather, and the old teahouse did not pay attention to hygiene. Immediately, a group of flies gathered on the young actor's face, stinging him so much that he was neither itchy nor painful, and it was extremely uncomfortable. Although his hands were not really tied, according to the rules of opera, he was not allowed to untie himself under any circumstances. The people watching the play in the front row saw him squinting, grimacing, shaking his head, and making all kinds of strange expressions, and they really didn't understand what was going on, which caused a burst of laughter. Later, Mu Guiying came on stage and sang with Yang Liulang for a long time, but the laughter from the audience continued. Yang Liulang and Mu Guiying were confused and thought they had made some mistake. They were at a loss, and they almost couldn't finish the performance. It was not until Guiying came to untie Zongbao that they realized what was going on. Da Liwu is really a scoundrel!</p>
<p>Two Notable Things About Righteous Actor Luo Kuifang Before His Death</p>
<p>The late Tan-style bearded actor Luo Xiaobao, courtesy name Kuifang, when it comes to his voice, it really had the taste of Yun Zhe Yue. Unfortunately, his family environment was too bad, and his wife was an unvirtuous woman, who often quarreled with him. Later, he even developed a disease of epilepsy. Therefore, he dared not overwork himself. When he performed in Shanghai, he only took some Tan-style operas that focused on singing, such as "Zhuofang," "Wujiapo," "Kongchengji," "Macao," "Fenhewan," "Pengbei," and "Tanmu," to perfunctorily entertain the audience. In fact, his specialty dramas, although he did not dare to compare with Shuyan, were always ten times higher than You Chen and Xiaopei. He could perform all kinds of operas that relied on fighting, such as "Dingjun Mountain" and "Zhulianzhai," and he performed them in a very proper manner, but it was just that he was ruined by his uncompetitive problem, which led to him not daring to ask about the above-mentioned plays.
