<h3>英日之東京談判</h3>
<p>英倫電訉頻傳：關於天津問題，將由英國駐日大使與日本外交當局，在東京圖謀解決。據未經正式證實之消息：日本要求於天津租界者，蓋有三要點，（一）搜索界內之中國反日份子，租界今後不復為反日根據地；（二）在華北金融上，租界務與日方合作，即界內不復支持中國之法幣，亦即接受偽鈔之流通；（三）界內存有中國各銀行現銀，計值華幣四千八百萬元，移交日方。至於所謂四嫌疑犯之引渡問題，原屬津案之近因，茲似存而不論；縱使在他日英日之解決案中，不致不予齒數，但今日雙方殊未以此為問題，固已不可掩矣。又封鎖時期內英僑備受淩辱，英國輿情憤激，實以此為焦點，似亦非東京談判所關切；此在英國當局，殆以為既往之淩辱，事屬「合該」，但求往後之淩辱，得邀豁免而已。</p>
<p>在此開始談判之前夕，據路透社所傳英國各報所取態度，大抵「以審慎之辭，表示歡迎，而含有強度之憂疑」；吾人觀感，亦復如此。誠以表面說來，英國自始主張天津問題作為地方事件而由談判求解決，故忍耐任何國族所不能忍之淩辱；迄今旬餘，談判可望開始矣，此謂張伯倫先生得意之作可也。彼當局之所以答復議員質問者，竟以此微示欣慰，其情可想而知。其實任何國際問題，本以談判為常軌；英國提議談判，自為日本所不拒絕；英國今若以日本應允談判而視為日本就範之徵，則太「誤會」矣。問題不在談判，而在歸宿；英國主要之見解尤在乎本問題之以地方事件為歸宿。抑何謂地方事件乎？以日本封鎖天津英法租界時，天津日軍當局之表示而論，如所謂在華租界問題焉，如所謂援助中國之抗戰政策問題焉，是誠超越地方事件之範圍，而為英國方面所曾表示絕不能接受者矣；然若上述日方所擬要求之三要點者，固皆曰天津租界應如何如何云云也，謂天津租界云云，豈非日本亦既承認地方範圍乎？英國固將以其為限於地方範圍而接受之乎？信若是，英國所謂地方事件，乃掩耳盜鈴之說也；何也。談判天津問題則限於天津地方而接受之，順流而下，上海地方也，鼓浪嶼地方也，甚至香港新加坡印度，無一而非地方也；舉凡武力封鎖之下，綏靖政策之中，豈但地方不路道，抑且天下太平矣。夫豈過甚之辭，日本應付疲軟之國家，以取得「地方」解決為最擅長；在九一八前後，彼在中國獲得地方解決之經騐亦最宏富；及中國發奮禦侮，首以「全面抗戰」詔告其人民者，即針對所謂「地方解決」者也。</p>
<p>茲作是說，吾人非敢菲薄英國疲軟至於斯極也，日前英國諾克斯少將在下議院質問曰：「首相其將於談判開始之際，堅主天津英僑所受干涉，今應絕對終止；其將聲明英國在兩星期以來之忍耐，實較有史以來，世界任何強國所忍而者為大乎？」可見憂疑於英國疲軟逾分者，初不僅吾人；而張伯倫氏對此質問，竟置不答，尤可見憂疑有由來矣。差可告慰者，英國對於東京談判，聞亦執持三端：（一）津案解決辦法，為效限於天津，此即所謂地方事件之說也是不足道，蓋日本本意，初未必以包圍天津而求囊括大英也；（二）津租界在中日國際保持中立性，在租界內保持事權之完整；（三）津事解決，務使不致虧捐英國之整個遠東政策。英國有權之當局是否如此執持，猶待事實為證明；信如所傳，則如二三兩端所指者，英國竟未毅然標舉為原則，而仍納之所謂「地方解決」之中，斯亦奇矣。</p>
<p>談判將始，或且早在談判中途，我人既憂英國當局之疲軟，復疑談判之未避孕必有何成就。蓋遠東前途，悉視中日戰爭之結果為轉移，故英日兩方，至少亦在日本方面，若非所求盡逐，未欲在戰爭終了之前，作何有關今後之決定，此其一。日本對於天津問題，所執雖小，所望則奢，彼所奢求，究與英國標榜之遠東政策相枘鑒糳，英國自未便公然自貶，此其二。日本內部之種種見解與策略，不相一致；軍人所不願接受者，東京所不敢妥協；軍人所希冀者，東京所未必能以外交貫澈之；此其三。英國之忍而與疲軟，究亦有其限度，而日本近年對英國之輕蔑，無不遠過英國之限度；此其四。英蘇談判之成敗，與日本對英之態度，根本息息相關；今英蘇談判成敗尚在未定之天，是為日本所視為觀望與要挾之絕好機會；而英國對蘇聯之一再讓步，尤使日本增進其對於英國之拗執；此其五。英國蘄求日本之中和派為對手，逐陷於策略上之根本謬誤；此在英國以為對日本中和派之示惠與結納，可以增進中和派在政治上之聲勢而便於英日談判之成功；此在日本極右派觀之，以為英國對中和派之委曲求全，即是英國忌憚極右派之明證，即是對英務取強硬準態度之理由，亦即是中和理論不足伸張日本威望之反證；故國際對日，每一退讓，每一妥協，則每次必使日本中和派啞口無言，而使極右派趾髙氣揚；今之東京談判，英國猶以為循外交途徑，走中和路綫，以摸索解決天津問題之鎖鑰，而不知計之左；此其六。惟此六者，行見談判之曠日持久，遷延不決。而英國當務之亟，還在使牛奶與麵包，如何繼續不斷輸入天津租界而已</p>
<h3>津英領赴日談判　天津局勢漸趨和緩　英方表示決不變更對華政策渝各團體電慰津租界內華人</h3>
<p>（天津）　此間對於外僑之搜身行動、已大見鬆動、但英租界內之英人商業與外人商業、則仍處於停頓之狀態中、據某英人言、日本因與蘇聯有發生大埁模戰爭之可能、故英日間之天津糾紛、易於了結、據此間某英國銀行家言、日方要求英方合作、並支持其「聯合準備銀行」之紙幣、此為不可能之事、（二十九日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（重慶）　日軍封鎖天津英法租界、已逾半月、重慶市各同業公會及婦女文化界等團體、以租界內同胞處水深火熱之中、至為繫念、特去電致慰、並勉以奮鬥到底、（二十八日電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　關於天津事件、此間接近外務部人士均謂、英國在遠東現行一般政策、尤其是關於中國貨幣之政策、不擬有所變更、中國各銀行在英租界存銀四千八百萬華幣、未便交予日方、蓋中國金融問題、不僅與英國有關、而英國對華政策、亦為英國整個外交政策之一部分、駐日大使克萊琦爵士與日本當局進行談話時、當將津案作為地方事件、設法予以解決、勿日本方面利用此案、而致其國對華政策為之變更、要之天津英租界保守中立一項原則、可為政府所接受、但英國在租界內之威權、則務當保持完整、（廿八日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）　英日兩國對於天津事件、即將進行談判事、頃由泰晤報加以評論、語氣之間、頗為樂觀、其詞略云、「英日兩國當局、昨曾宣佈、即當在東京進行談判、此誠吾人所樂聞、至以雙方所當討論之問題論、日本當局雖謂不以程錫庚案四華人引渡問題為限、但共範圍亦當限於華北日軍有關各項問題、關於此層、一俟談判開始之後、當可獲有分曉、至於日本所可提出之要求、其中有已被拒絕者、亦有難以接受者、將來如何解決、雖不可知、但就目前情形而論、談判地點、既由天津移至東京、足見日本外交當局、甚願覔取和平的合理的解決辦法、緣天津局勢極為緊張、若在該處談判、勢必失敗無疑、果爾、則由地方糾紛而引起極嚴重之發展、必且無法避免」、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（柏林）　德國政府前於四月二十八日向英國提出照會、將英德海軍協定宣告廢止之後、英國駐德大使漢德林爵士、頃以備忘錄一件送達外交部、加以答復、內容略謂、英國現行政策、並無包圍德國之意云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>英政府備忘錄內容</p>

<p>德報評論英備忘錄</p>
<p>（柏林）　德國報章對英國廢棄英德協定備忘錄之第一反應、並不認為英國之態度「含有進行談判之盛意與信心、」各報論調均謂、「關於德國之立場、元首希特勒已於四月二十八日發表演說、明白表示願意開談判之門、廓清誤解、反之、英國對此項建議、未能明白加以接受、今英國備忘錄、對主要題目避不涉及、對德國主張則重新限制、彼此海軍利益範圍一事、亦未加以明白答復、按此種利益範圍已為英國包圍政策所破壞、今英國備忘錄除給予含糊之答復外、復譴責德國對小國家有所陰謀、此誠對於廓清國際糾紛、毫無輔助」、（廿九日海通社電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　關於德國廢止英德海軍協定、英國政府所提出之備忘錄、頃由此間各報加以尖銳抨擊、國社黨機關報「人民觀察報」評曰、「英國備忘錄對元首希特勒之國會演說、表示德國雖廢止英德海軍協定、但仍願意與英國成立諒解、重新明白劃定彼此利益範圍一節、並未加以具體答復、此乃英國備忘錄弱點之表現、英國真欲仍以海軍協定為限制他國海軍軍備之工具乎」、「漢堡地方日報」評曰、「欲促進世界之和平與人民之福利、若英國仍抱定懷疑之心、則無從產生此種信仰」、「德意志總　報」評曰、「英國備忘錄對德國政策之事實、仍未瞭解、要知德國並不認為英國乃德國之仇敵、德國願意避不干涉英帝國、但以英國亦不干涉德國為條件、今則不然、英國一意推行包圍政策、存心阻撓德國肅清凡爾賽和約之努力、今英國備忘錄仍未表示從事談判之誠意、英國日謂所行政策乃對付侵略國定、實則此項定義未見精當、在未發生衝突前、何能決定誰為侵略者、誰為被侵略者、非於事後無從判定、今德國即以此語反質英國、英國其將何以自解、故德國詮定英國之政策為「包圍政策」、對英國陰謀甚相符合」、（二十九日海通電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）民主黨議員亞力山大、向以反日著稱、今日對於勃魯姆中立法草案大施攻擊、認此草案僅有利於英國與日本、其所以有利日本之故、即容許日本向美國購買軍火與軍用品、同時中國則以自國無船隻之故、反而無法購買、據亞氏言、美國之大患、並非德國、亦非義國、而為日本、日本之目的、在利用美國之軍火武器與軍用原料、以征服中國、獨覇東亞、然後進而攻擊美國、亞氏認勃魯姆草案、不獨親英親日、同時亦囿於成見、而昧於事實、殊無足取之處、（二十九日美聯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）關於中立法問題、衆議院外交委員會主席白魯姆所提修正案、（主張廢止關於禁運軍火之現行條款、並授權總統指定交戰國及戰區、）頃由衆議院賡續討論、民主黨議員珊、萊、會謂與其制定不完備之中立法、不如無之、共和黨各議員均鼓掌稱善、共和黨議員巴頓、則謂任何中立法、决難完備、吾人决不聽任美國一兵一卒往國外作戰、（各議員熱烈鼓掌）又謂、他日戰事發生之後、吾人若果禁止軍火運往英法兩國、則倫敦巴黎一旦遭受空襲、輿論對於禁運辦法、反應之烈、正恐難以抵抗云、觀於本日討論給果、大多數議員均主回復國際公法所規定之中立狀態、仍得以軍火邋往各交戰國、而將現行中立法完全予以廢止、僅將軍火出口之監察與領取許可證一項現行辦法、予以保持、此種重要的修正、倘由衆議院予以接受、則以信用放款給予各交戰國一層、將仍有實行之可能、而軍火禁運辦法、亦必歸於取消、衆議院茲定於明日提付表决、外交委員會民主黨各委員、將於衆院開會之前、先行隻會、决定熊度、（廿八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國抑低銀價　志在壓迫日本　倫敦人士觀察如是美方謂係防止拋售</h3>
<p>（倫敦）美國財政部將購買國外白銀所定價格一再抑低之後、此間銀價每盎斯又跌落四分之三便士、本日晚間美國財部當局是吾賡續抑低銀價、尙不可知、此間市場上一般人均引領以待消息之來、據金融界某某人士觀察、銀價每盎斯不致跌至十八便士以下、並以為銀價跌落、足以構成對付日本之有力的武器、美國當局或將予以利用、促使日本採取較為和緩之態度、亦未可知云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）財政部於昨日將國外白銀買價、自每盎斯四角三分减至四角後、本日又减至三角八分半、兩日來業已成低兩决、財部高級當局、拒不解釋貶價原因、但負責方面宣稱、此舉純係防止外國白銀於國會决定白銀政策之前、在美國市塲大量拋售云、（廿八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國政府與國會反對派、對於白銀政策之意見納鑿、倫敦銀市大受影響、銀價每盎斯跌去四分之三便士、關係方面現方靜待發展、並謂此後情形如何、須視美國當局之態度為斷云、（廿八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）衆議院本日開會時、議塲經過情形極為熱烈、共和黨議員費煦對於總統享有臃買國外白銀與變更美元成色之權力、表示反對、但民主黨議員蘇默斯、（即衆議院幣制委員會主席）則竭力加以反駁，略謂、總統向中國與墨西哥購買白銀之權、應聽其保持、以中國而倫、美國在華商務、因此可有發展之望、以墨西哥國而倫、該國幣價昨日巳因參議院之表决、而跌去百分之十、影響之大於此可見」云、討論結果、卒以二百零九對一百六十一票之多數、通過决議案、由衆院推定代表五人、會同參議院代表、組織聯席委員會、俾克擬定折衷方案、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>蘇聯的西窗　（繼）</h3>
<p>— 特也</p>
<p>這些資料，還未盡得其眞相，因爲北氷洋蘇聯艦隊的實力和組織，能够迅速地由克朗斯太特港（目下仍爲蘇聯最大的海軍根據地）取道波羅的海通白海的運河開到中型軍艦，把它增强，不過這條運河只有夏季可以通航。</p>
<p>蘇聯爲什麼這樣注重茂曼斯克區的軍事發展呢？這個問題却不能以純粹爲了防衛來作答的，因爲防守該地，不必用及這樣雄厚的兵力，那末，她是不是爲着進攻起見而出此呢？於是又發生了她準備攻誰的問題。芬蘭挪威兩國都目覩這些偉大的軍備，兩國的心念中，絕無攻擊蘇聯的一回事，那末，蘇聯會攫取芬挪兩國在北冰洋濱的土地麼？許多事件已表明蘇聯確有這種傾向，例如蘇聯神秘的飛機時常飛過芬蘭的北境，假使說蘇聯飛行家不是耍由天空窺測土地，用攝影機攝取地勢，叉何必多此麻煩呢？</p>
<p>吾們當憶及蘇聯通達北大海的孔道，只限於長五十哩的一段土地，甚至在那裏，氣候變化不定，或是降霧，或有風雨，而且和大海航錢相距太遠。芬蘭的海濱却有無數深海灣而爲終年不凍的天然大船港，由此進至大海，比在茂曼海岸出發，安穩得多。另有一個因素，那是挪威海濱的那爾維克港，Narvik一九三八年有世界最佳的礦砂八百萬噸，（都來自瑞典拉伯蘭）曾由該港運往世界各處。這些礦砂是歐洲最重要的供給，最近因爲各國競爭軍備，更見重要。遇到戰事發生，蘇聯若能控制這物的輸出，或用空襲方法，使諸礦停止開採，於是有關係的各國都要感覺不愉快了。挪威芬蘭兩國現日見不安，挪威的國防本來很爲單薄，挪威的專家鑒於蘇聯北冰洋的軍備，日見擴張，挪威的防務，相形見絀，因此大爲焦慮。</p>
<p>芬蘭在和俄國所訂的和約條款下，於北冰洋方面，大受妨碍。自一九二〇年起，她經過彼察摩走廓PersamoCroridor和北冰洋接界，她只可在彼察摩灣停泊幾艘巡還艇，却仍然不可建設任何防禦工程，或飛機根據地。不携武裝的蘇聯飛機得飛過該地，承平時芬蘭拉伯蘭不駐常備軍，只駐少數邊防隊和以志願兵組成的地方保衛團，實際上未作防空設備。但因爲彼察摩諸礦有豐富的鎳產，當地工業也日見發達，該地的價値，隨以增高，所以豫料不久將置相當的軍備。不過紅軍勢力雄厚，尤其由於持降落傘的軍隊最近發展驚人的技術，天空方面，更防不勝防，即使佈置相當的軍防，未必有多大的效果。從這些事實看來，吾們能够斷定</p>
<p>北冰洋海岸一帶，是絕易受蘇聯攻擊的。近來北歐諸國曾倡「武裝中立集團」之議，巳經過多時的討論，也許還能利用現在所有的防軍，担保北歐安全至某種程度。這一個防守聯盟使關心北歐完整的各國得到安全的感覺，德國也是其中之一啊。　（完）</p>

<p>豆米市場管理委員會、鑒於市場行號客商、對於市場章則、視若無睹、咸私行交易、致市場秩序混亂、價格軒　不定、影響民食、至鉅且大、且行客問時起糾紛、茲該管理委員會、為再行整理修訂章程起見、特於昨午十一時半、假座四馬路常熱山景圖、舉行行客、</p>
<p>聯席會議</p>
<p>公推符前耕為臨時主席、首由主席報告開會宗旨、旋即開始討論、修改市場章程、務使一零五家行號及客商、皆能遵守為原則、同時、商討市場</p>
<p>營業方針</p>
<p>使各行號交易得克趨正規、聞討論結果、頗為圓滿、新聲社記者昨向米市場方面探詢、昨晨市場九時開盤後、因囤戶紛紛脫售、並六七千包、車輛運滬米糧三四千包、工部局按日派員赴市場監督、對市場各貨交易價格、</p>
<p>一經發覺</p>
<p>有人提高市價、即將確實姓名行號等、抄送局內、按章處罰、並嚴厲執行限價、決不使米價上漲、有礙界內治安、況三千噸西貢洋米業已成交、故滬市整個民食</p>
<p>決可無虞</p>
<p>存底或將按日增加、據新新社記者探悉上海市現雖遵照、限價交易但不久勢將下跌、其</p>
<p>原因有六</p>
<p>滬市各堆內棧及市民存儲、至少可維持三個月以上之糧、　產地雖禁阻出境事件但按照其規定繳納捐稅、仍多放行、故水陸路來賓、每日平均至少有四五千石、　各地得雨秋收有望、　新米上市再過二月有餘即可實現　洋米訂購成交、下月中陸續運到、　盛傳工部局有</p>
<p>再度抑低</p>
<p>米價說、一般囤戶、均乘機脫售、市場將呈供過於求之現象、故基以上各種原因、米價勢必下跌、決無上漲可能云、</p>
<h3>登陸企圖不逞　日機轟炸北沙　新港靈甸被頭十餘彈　新炸死傷平民十餘人</h3>
<p>北沙航綫沿海各港、連日仍遭日艦炮轟、前日複有日機三架、前往複有日機三架、前往投彈、轟炸港口民舍、死傷平民十餘人、茲經大光社記者探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>日機轟炸　新港靈甸</p>
<p>日艦（三十二號）及武裝汽艇、昨仍續向各港岸上發炮轟擊、但登陸企圖、迄未得逞、日軍惱羞之下、為洩忿起見、派飛機三架、於前日（二十七日）上午十時、由崇明飛機場起飛、前往新港鎮靈甸鎮投彈十餘枚、濫肆轟炸、鎮上民舍起火焚燒、濃煙迷漫、</p>
<p>民房被毀　死傷十餘</p>
<p>新港鎮靈甸鎮距港口僅半里許、日軍疑華軍隱伏鎮上民房、以為掩蔽、搜案目標、至或困難、乃派飛機三架前往轟炸、一面則由日艦炮轟三和港萬家港、遙相呼應、是役被炸死傷平民十餘人、類多老弱婦孺、據大光社記者向北沙來人探悉、新港鎮居民因事先疏散、僅炸斃江姓等小孩二名、靈甸鎮死傷較重、西市落二彈、毀源盛泰治坊、死鄉人劉姓等三名、中市河東落三彈、毀蘇恰隆雜貨號、死顧七斤老夫婦及兩幼孫、北市落二彈、毀萬成昌店房、死方姓等四名、餘彈均落田野、日機慘殺無辜、其殘酷行為、可見一斑、</p>
<p>外商各輪　擬改夜班</p>
<p>北沙戰事雖在演進中、惟外為維持滬沙交通、仍照常航行、昨晨開出者、為英商怡和之義、和輪、進口者為德商遠東之海宜輪、福華之江定輪、於昨日下午四時三十分抵埠、泊外灘碼頭、各輪因航行終止點為日軍所指定之青龍港、客貨稀少、為維持營業起見、於昨晚特集議討論、擬改開夜班、當天來往、藉以減輕穿上開支、</p>
<h3>中美法三民主國　慶祝七月令節　七月一日四日及十四日　民眾均各懸旗以誌慶祝</h3>
<p>七月一日為中華民國國民政府成立紀念日、七月四日為美國獨立紀念日、七月十四日為法國民主紀念日、此三大民主國家之寶貴紀念日、適同在七月上半月之內、可謂一種極自然佳妙之象徵、茲問本市華市民·及美·法·兩國僑民、於個該紀念日均一律懸掛國旗一天、以誌慶祝、</p>
<p>旅客繞道　沿途滋擾</p>
<p>昨日輪船到埠時、旅滬海啟鄉人、群往碼頭探訊故鄉被炸消息、據大光社記者詢據由呂四方面冒險繞道青龍港、搭輪來滬之某君答稱、自各輪被阻不兼灣新港靈甸港三和港後、在餘東·包場·六甲·呂四·三陽·九隆·等處旅客、往來至感艱難、道途跋涉、行徑日軍警戒區、須遭日偽軍警搜索盤詰、百般刁難、故咸不敢冒險嘗試、行旅多為裏足、昨日繞道上述港口來滬者、為數極少、沿途開炮聲隆隆、知有戰爭、鄉間民眾則尚安定、</p>

<h3>花界勸募認養經費　贈獎大會　贈品「澤被災黎」名花答詞繼續努力</h3>
<p>上海難民救濟協會市民組勸募委員會昨舉行花界贈獎大會。播音勸銷金石古玩書畫贈獎券亦於昨日開始、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>主席報告</p>
<p>市民組花界贈獎大會、於昨日下午四時、假座四馬路大西洋茶社舉行、到處洽鄉等及花界公三百餘人、首由主席林康候致詞報告、略謂、本會於本年元旦、在新新電臺舉行不因勸募認養難民經費、承全市北里名花熱烈參加、一日之聞、得款兩萬餘元、成績卓著、今日舉行花界贈獎、一面代表難民向花界贈獎、一面代表難民向花界諸位小姐表示謝意、一面本會近受難民救濟協會委託、辦理勸銷金石古玩書畫券、此項贈獎券、計共八百張、凡捐款十元即贈送一張、券券有贈、已定七月九日在寧波同鄉會抽籤領獎、茲以為迫切、仍望花界本過去熱忱、繼續贊助、代為勸銷、不勝感企、此由袁履登·周邦俊·陶樂勤·等相繼致詞、語多激勵、</p>
<p>分組頒獎</p>
<p>旋由虞洽卿·林康侯·袁履登·三氏主持給獎、除齊贈謝狀、以留紀念外、其餘視勸募成績、分別加贈鏡框·銀杯·銀鼎·銀盾·等、上鍋「澤被災黎」四字、共謝狀文曰、「茲承某女史參加播音勸募認養難民經費、熱心慈善、無任感佩、僅此誌謝、並留紀念」、以人數眾多及成績不同、共分六組給獎、情況非常熱烈、贈獎畢、由冠軍蓮香小姐、亞軍蓉初·筱素蘭·等、分別致答詞、均謂非常時期、救難人人有責、花界仍當繼續努力、</p>
<p>播音勸募</p>
<p>該會播音勸銷金石古玩書畫贈送券、業於昨日假座大亞電臺開始、今日在天　電臺繼續舉行、花界亦定今日下午七時起至十二時止、參加播送節目、金石古玩書畫贈送辦法如下、　本券共計八百張、分為八百號、每張募捐十元、　每券贈品一件、多捐多贈、對好抽籤、　贈品於七月九日在寧波同鄉會陳列、任人參觀、隨到隨抽、　憑券抽籤、按號領獎、不得更換、　贈品須由受贈人自行領取、恕不致送、</p>
<h3>電政公債　本息暫停　抽籤照常舉行並不影響債信</h3>
<p>民國二十四年電政公債第十五次還本抽籤、已於六月十日由國債基金管理委員會在滬舉行、計抽三支應還本國幣三十萬元、依照條例及還本付息表規定、於今日由各地中中交三行開始付款、但據新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、此項電政公債、系屬於交通部發行、聞已由去年九月起本息暫行停付、又該項公債、並不流通市面、所以停服本息、並不影響整個償債、</p>
<h3>工部局市政銀行　收受活期存款</h3>
<p>工部局市政銀行定於七月三日值五日（星期一至星期三）止、收受活期存款、每年給息五釐、收款處在江西路二　九號、該局總辦公處財務處公債銀行股（地二五七號辦公室）、又該行在每日辦公時間內、依照工部局佈告第四九二號規定、收受定期六個月及十二個月之存款、定期六個月年息五釐、定期十二個月著年息六釐、凡欲探詢詳情、可向該局財務處接洽、</p>
<h3>矛盾的現象　日圓限制回國　每人每次以二百元為限日方規定所謂「新條例」</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、關於上海於日本見日元之往來、日方定七月一日起實施新條例、東京大藏省頃已修正日本外匯統制法制條款、俾限制由日本出口來滬之日元、同時減少自上海復回日本之日元、按照新條例、準許每一出國日人所攜有自由限制之匯款及旅費等等、將自日金千元減至僅伍佰元、凡貨幣、匯票於信用領款書、均包括在內、日人旅客攜價值較巨之款項出國者、須得日本銀行特許、日元自海外復回日本、此前未受任何合法限制者、將限制至每人每次僅二百元、如攜回日本之日元超過此數、則將悉被沒收、</p>
<h3>日本國內經濟已至山窮水盡階段　薙刀片鋼筆尖均溶造軍火東京已呈隍不安之氣氛</h3>
<p>據美國國務院記錄披露、四月份日本未向美國</p>
<p>購買戰具</p>
<p>此所言者、乃實在軍器之謂、日本向美所購物品、頗多間接用於戰爭者無疑、大藏省已近已頒佈下列之命令、凡具有黃金製成之下開物件者、均須於七月五日前將所有黃金數量呈報大藏省、計開、戒指·手飾、與其他私人飾物、錶殼、眼鏡邊、與其他個人所備物、紙煙管·紙煙盒·杯·壺、及其他</p>
<p>飲食器皿</p>
<p>蠟燭·香爐·紙鎮·削筆刀·裁紙刀·圖章、及其他家用物品、日當局已請珠寶公會佛用黃金製造任何物品、並請商店勿陳列任何黃金物品、由此推斷、日政府現已直入其人民家中、搜羅此寶貴之黃色金屬、以供購買物料、支持其軍隊在華作戰之用矣、同時</p>
<p>官方宣佈</p>
<p>不久將實行口糧製、是項制度適用於牛油·牛乳·蛋·茶·糖、及其他視頻、據日本報紙載稱、政府已決定此項步驟「從人民生活標準暫必因以降低、亦在所不顧云、日本擬將此等物品輸售於海外、至少將小補其整個外流之外幣、由此獲得每</p>
<p>一文外幣</p>
<p>盡將繼續用於戰事、此即日本在世界市場上所表露之景象也、經濟家謂日本顯擬竭力謀取外幣、購買必需品、以供軍隊之消耗、日政府任意穩定價格、惟成本劇漲、致售出物品、毫無盈餘、目前日本之多種產物、均須數錢之「經手費」、或「服務費」零售商</p>
<p>因而失敗</p>
<p>者、比比皆是、故借款利率、已自五分七減至四分八、盈千　萬之破產商人與職員、均已改操他業、金錢流轉日速、貨物缺乏、供不應求、此雖未必為通貨膨脹、惟經濟家稱去膨脹已不遠矣、此種國內局勢雖覺嚴重、然猶不若　資維持戰爭問題</p>
<p>嚴重之甚</p>
<p>而用資金維持和平、問題亦殊繁多、半載之前、日本金融領袖極信人本之經濟力能維持作戰與和平、今日東京已顯呈強烈的狐疑·躊躇·與杌　不安之氣氛、朝野雖尚未公然表示悲觀、但其濃厚之樂觀、必已消散矣、自戰爭爆發日其、中國領袖即堅稱中國龍繼續長期抗戰、足令日本</p>
<p>經濟崩潰</p>
<p>今中立觀察確將敗於此途、雖猶不懷疑、然戰爭陷入僵持之局、日本財政因在大陸無限期維持大軍之消耗、而　絕重之擔負、此與經紀機構之崩潰無殊已、東京謠傳日本刻　對華「有所措施」、將以當面提出若干之妥協云云、蓋眾知日本財政局勢今固甚形嚴重、而不得不出此也、（完）</p>

<h3>法公董局僱員加薪　日內正式宣佈　加薪以外另加津貼悉依職員家累而定</h3>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、昨（二十八日）悉法租界公董局將於一兩日內、正式宣佈增加僱員薪給、調査生活情况及修正薪金的必要之委員會所提建議、已經核准、加薪詳則將刋下期公董局公報、聞諸可靠方面、公董局僱員薪給、將按照高低之基本薪俸與國籍而分別大增、於是法。華。俄。越。僱員對於目前之生活程度高漲、與法幣價値低跌、所受之損失、可得償補矣、</p>
<p>寓滬僱員增薪標準</p>
<p>按一九三八年七月四日公董局給予僱員之特別津貼、自百分之七至二十二者、均已廢除、現建議對於寓居上海之僱員、按照一九三八年七月四日以前之基本薪俸、實行另增什三至什五、以代該項津貼、如匯率停留於五便士五、至七便士一二五之問、則將長此實行此等津貼、</p>
<p>低薪職員尤為優待</p>
<p>薪金在七百元以下之職員、最受實惠、計照基木薪給增什五、月薪七百元以上者、照薪最多增什三、此係已婚者所加之薪、獨身男子所加之薪較少什一、</p>
<p>華法僱員另加津貼</p>
<p>此外、公董局已婚法籍人員之孩童津貼、亦將增加、從前十八歲以下孩童月貼十四心者、將增至四十元、已婚人員　寓所津貼、亦將增加、華員除照百分比加　外、並將月給津貼一元、</p>
<p>補償目前生活費用</p>
<p>廿九日法文上海日報稱、按在一九三八年七月四日、法公董局會給與所屬職工以臨時津貼其範圍爲百分之七至百分之二十二、蓋所以補救生活程度之高漲、在當時、此項津貼、係與薪水之大小成反比例、即薪水小者津貼多、薪水大者津貼少是也、現聞此項臨時津貼已取銷、近因生活程度又高、故乃决定、另代以他種津貼、亦爲臨時性質、其範圍係爲百分之三十至百分之五十</p>
<p>加給辦法有效期間</p>
<p>此次津貼、亦與前同、係與薪俸之大小成反比、而未結婚者之津貼、則較之已結婚者、每級均少百分之十、聞此次津貼之有效期間、係儘在法幣偵英金五便士半至七便士半間、均當照給之、至於華員方面、則在一九三八年七月間、原得有平均加薪百分之七者、現當加薪至百分之廿、每月並另加米貼二元、又如法職員之家庭津貼、每一小孩、前僅按月可領有十四元者、現則增至每孩按月四十元、依此觀之、此次之新津貼辦法、係依職員家累而定、且對於低薪之職員、尤為比例的優待、</p>
<h3>英輪運廢鐵濟日　水陸均遭厄運　美碼頭工人阻止通過裝鐵英輪觸暗礁沉沒　國泰開映沉輪影片中外鼓掌</h3>
<p>密勒氏評論報云、英貨輪波寗登號、載有擬運往日本之廢鐵、六月二十五日被阻於美國華盛頓州之太柯馬、因碼頭工人拒不經過碼頭上所置糾察綫之故也、置該糾察錢者爲美國不參與日木侵略委員會之太柯馬分會、該團體之首腦、即美國前國務　史汀生、其目的在防杜軍火與作戰之基本物料山美運往日本、另一艘英輪丹波爾巴號、亦載接濟日本軍火廠之廢鐵者、四月九日在華盛頓州之奎拉育特以外觸暗礁而沉沒、輪員三十六人均經救起、但所載廢鐵八千噸、全部喪失、所攝該破輪之新聞短片、近在上海國泰戲院開映、滿院中外觀衆見之、無不鼓掌、歷數分鐘不絕、</p>
<h3>定海城失陷經過　日軍千四百人分三路登陸舟山中學校長被日方扣留縣長蘇本善現守孤島待援</h3>
<p>定海失陷情形、迄至咋日、始獲詳細之報告、蓋親歷事變之商人、昨已有逃避抵滬者、茲記述於后、</p>
<p>登陸情形</p>
<p>日軍之攫奪定海、計分三處登陸、即一爲縣城迤東距離約有八十里之沈家門鎭、一爲城偏南距離約十餘里之鹽倉村、一爲道頭與東嶽宮、自沈家門登陸日軍、抵城最後、餘從東門進城、自鹽倉登陸之日軍次之、係從西門進城、在道頭登陸日軍、則由南門首撲縣城、三路人數、約一千四百餘人、因有引導、故均抄曲折小徑、宛如熟路</p>
<p>校長被扣</p>
<p>當日軍在道頭登陸時、曾以機槍掃射、道頭江心、有日艦兩艘、向岸開砲、開設道頭之泉大醬園、當被擊燬、其時舟山巾學校長方向源、基督敎堂收師陳德宏、相偕登日艦、要求日軍撤退、並勿糜爛地方、常爲日軍扣留、似將利用之以組織所謂「維持會」也、</p>
<p>白泉轉戰</p>
<p>當時駐守北郊普慈寺駐軍、及定海所有自衛團隊、由蘇木善縣長率領抵抗、激戰四小時。以衆寡不敵、退向煩河嶺、現已轉戰至白泉。小展。大展。一帶、至定城居民、於發生事變時、即悉數撤退至山鄕、總計是役、祗死傷三四十人、惟存儲於東鄉白鶴廟等處之糧食、均被刦一空、故撤退山鄕軍民之食糧問題、殊堪憂慮、</p>
<p>悲壯一幕</p>
<p>定海蘇縣長、以事起倉卒、當時竟不及携其夫人同行、當其在煩河嶺率部抗戰時、其夫人始由僚屬伴送前來、蘇縣畏即與夫人執手嗚咽、激昂而言曰、當此强敵壓境、地方官吏、祗知盡忠殉職、不能再以家室爲念矣、夫人請自便、行矣勉之、　畢、即與夫人作別、情詞悲壯、</p>
<p>死守某島</p>
<p>現悉蘇縣長、除將都隊分散、以游擊戰略、困擾日軍外、其本人已渡海至某島、死守待援、隨從軍民尙有二百餘人、聞已斷糧一日矣、至其夫人當時與縣長泣別後、即由縣府僚屬、將其喬裝乘船、經護送抵甬、現已轉赴金華、向黃主席面陳事變經過、又當日軍在道頸登陸時、上空有日機三架掩護、至沈家門失陷情形、則未甚明瞭、第悉是日計來日艦四艘、會向岸開砲、鎭h濟源酒坊、被擊燬云、</p>

<p>海鹽澉婦人徐吳氏，在英租界河南路東棋盤衛兆泰洋貨號主王申夫家幫傭、忽於二十三日上午赴三茅隔橋亞洲飯店內開房間吞服安神藥片自殺，并遺書寃單兩紙、指被出任吞沒積存工資六百元、及販賣劣貨、被虐不堪，託店夥張福成出洋八元，買安神藥片等情、氏因救治無效身死、經捕房報請法院檢驗，各情已</p>
<p>詳誌昨報</p>
<p>茲悉此案業經法捕房派　向各方調查、對於死者寃單所紀、并不確認，而氏似患花癡病象、緣徐吳氏與兆泰洋貨號主王申夫係同鄉熟識、於七年前受雇，未　保人、每月辛工五元，其工資陸續支用外、積得二百元、金戒一隻、存在雇主處，上年四月間、氏有何姓姘夫在原籍病故後、即患</p>
<p>神經失常</p>
<p>至十一月間歇、并薦彼往北京路顧家弄史姓家雇工一月餘，亦因工作錯亂被歇、氏仍投舊主王申夫家、要求收留雇用、因見其病象較前更甚、拒絕雇用、即交還存儲工資二百元與金戒，去後、氏又在外置辦上等綢緞壽衣一套、再回王家聲音、不予雇用、死後亦要陷害、旋即他去、事隔數月、即在旅館</p>
<p>服毒自殺</p>
<p>又對託店夥張福成代購安神藥片、亦不確實、按氏於年前曾向張追求戀愛、被拒絕、現張回鄉間結婚已近兩月矣、而兆泰洋貨號經營呢絨　頭西洋各邦貨物、向與低劣貨品隔絕云云、由探據情報告捕頭核辦、</p>

<p>喬路易於第四回合未終了時、用其左手將勁敵茄倫吐、擊倒在地蟬聯其拳擊王座、費時僅兩分三十九秒、茄倫吐此番雖屬敗北、但一般人皆謂其可怖之攻擊、爲喬路易前所未遇者、喬雖勝、亦費盡九牛之力、第一會合內、雙方聚精會神、互相試探雙方、當茄倫吐出其左右手攻擊時、台下彩聲如雷、相持不久、茄出左手作一重擊、中喬之顎、而喬亦以牙還牙、第二會合、茄又施故技、再以左拳出擊、喬則以巧妙之方法襲擊其頭部、同時時又以左拳揮中茄顎、是時喬拳勢如狂風驟雨、茄忙於招架、後喬又施一可　之重擊、將茄打至繩邊、未幾鈴聲響、第二會合終、三合內茄倫吐之鼻已受創流血、但仍勇敢應戰、先攻喬左、然後亦還以足力之左拳中其顎、喬竟因而仆地、足徴其有力矣、但喬仍立即起立　將廝殺時第三會回又完、此後火併甚烈、喬路易因經騐足、在萬分緊張之局面下揮一極硬之左拳、擊倒茄倫吐保持其皇座　、</p>

<p>國醫與食養</p>
<h3>「疰夏」之食療品</h3>
<p>— 吳善慶</p>
<p>炎夏時節，海暑薰蒸，最普遍之疾病，厥惟「痊夏。」無論男女老幼，或輕或重，時有患者。如覺手足棉軟，懶於動作，食慾不振，昏昏欲睡，面黃肌瘦，神疲力乏，即為已患　夏之徵象·皆由於天時悶熱，地氣穢濕腸胃消化失常所致也。</p>
<p>疰夏之證，古稱夏痿，以其精神疲乏，四肢懶懈，猶如草木枯萎不振「邪之所湊，其氣必虛，」虛之所在，乃由腸消導不健，無力抵抗炎暑，遂成　夏。在未病之先，應預用培養食品，應常用黑棗，或紅棗，飯鍋上蒸之，或用水煮之，剝去皮核，每日用作點心常食，並飲其湯，功　健脾和胃，增進抵抗能力，蓋棗肉含有糖質與粘液質，能使血中氧化力增加，細胞繁殖力擴大，故多用緩和強壯之補品，　夏病前，宜常食之。</p>
<p>既病之後，宜祛濕熱，常食苡仁粥，即用生苡仁和水，煮作粥食，功能祛濕清熱，養胃和脾，利筋骨，舒經絡；且苡仁最富滋養，亦易消化，其所含之蛋白質，又多於他種穀類，既能祛濕熱，又可助榮養，用作　夏之食養品，實有一舉兩得之妙。</p>
<p>他如蔬菜水果等物，亦有同等功效，如綠豆粥、扁豆湯、蘿蔔乾，大頭菜，甜醬瓜，監豆豉、絲瓜、百合，榨菜，荸萕、甘蔗，西瓜等，俱為　夏者所宜食，以其有清暑化濕、利氣和血，調脾胃，益臟腑之效也·惟酸冷果物，甘肥肉食，以及不易消化或宿食變味之物，概當禁忌·否則積滯腸胃，難免因　夏二連帶發生變病，致成濕溫，吐瀉，瘧疾，諸癥·可不慎哉！</p>
<h3>「不多食」毋求飽</h3>
<p>— 金哲明</p>
<p>「不多食」這三個字，也是二千多年前孔子所說的，它的意義，分明是教導人們在飲食的時候，不可過飽；俗語說得好：「少吃多滋味，多吃填肚皮」，真是至理名言。因為漫無節制的恣飲飽食，結果使腸胃消化機能停滯，而且容易發生胸口氣悶，肚腹飽脹，吞腐反酸，胃口不開……許多病痛。我們要明瞭：飲食的作用，不過是增加體內的原動力罷了！所以採取食料的原則，應求其易於消化、富於營養，並不在乎質量的多少。在攝取飲食的時候，必須留有相當的餘地，就是運動家也要這樣實行（游泳家更不宜飽食）一般人常有一種抽象的見解，以為運動家必須多食，並且非多食肉類食物不可，實在這是錯誤的，往往有許多運動家，因此而鬧得害起胃病來。勞心的人，更不可多吃，而且應當減少食量，這是因為勞心的人，多用腦，少用力，體力沒有多大消耗，所以不必多食，多食反而有害，因為定量的血液，多食則消化管內循環作用旺盛，而且血液加多，四肢和腦髓的內的血液，同時減少，而是貧血的狀態，飽食後全身疲倦，怠惰，思眠，就是這個理由。尤其是人在飽食之後，思想遲鈍，肌肉鬆弛。所以吾們應當根據「君子食毋求飽」（不多食）的明訓，自知謹慎。</p>
<h3>温病小誌（二）</h3>
<p>— 楊彥和</p>
<p>余錢論溫病過程中，往往有汗多亡陽，及熱退病不退等　癥，茲猶未盡，特再補充：夫誤表傷津，誤下暴脫，勞倦內傷，而現神呆昏　，舌強苔黑，咽乾耳聾，心悸動，脈結代等徵象者，在醫學術語上，名之曰「壞證」。此時必須使氣充以卻病，俾正複而邪觸。願其法惟何？吳鞠通氏，特標榜之曰：「留人治病法。」其方本　於葉天士臨諧指兩鳳溫第八案，及溫熱第十六諸案，惜常人輕易放過，殊可慨耳！吳氏特將此法，定為「加減複脈湯」，而又鄭重叮嚀曰：「雖有他癥，後治之。」蓋此際神魂搖曳，不絕如縷，苟不願其存陰，徒知頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳，稍有　激。則搖曳之神魂，必脫離軀殼而飛越矣。吁！可不慎乎？此外尚有救逆及三甲等方，要在隨癥加減抉擇，又不可拘泥於一方也。（完）</p>
<h3>預防失眠</h3>
<p>— 徐林炎</p>
<p>失眠之癥，大都因肝旺而致：蓋肝火上升，則胸悶，心煩，頭疼，雖覺疲倦，苦難入夢，思潮起伏，煩悵交併，翌晨則精神萎靡，辦事無力。此外神經衰弱者，尤多患此：蓋神經衰弱，則感覺必特殊銳敏，故不特難於入眠，即能入眠，稍有聲響，亦極易驚醒。預防之法，端在力自攝生調理，下列諸端，依法試之，日久自效。一，宜清心寡欲，遇事勿動怒，勿氣憤。二，房事力求減少·三，勿食辛辣刺激之物。四，戒煙酒。五，多食滋陰之品。六，大便宜每日暢通。七，睡前用熱水洗足，並先小便。八，睡前勿講話，上床後宜略書報，以甯心神，但以稍覺倦意為度。九，忌夜遊，實行早眠早起。十，勤沐浴，十一，多作郊外散步，飽吸請鮮空氣。十二，臥室燈光勿宜太強，夏日窗簾及燈泡宜用綠色為佳。十三，食「棗仁」「蓮心」及蘆根茶等。</p>
<h3>告施茶者</h3>
<p>— 心仁</p>
<p>現在夏天將要到了，往往在十字路口電線杆旁，擺著一只涼茶缸，同時，馬路旁也有做一枚錢一碗茶的買賣的，但在這繁華的都市裏，終日塵土飛揚，假使茶缸沒有塵，那末灰塵和蒼蠅都要飛進茶缸裏去了。</p>
<p>苦力們在熱日下奔走得滿頭大汗，口渴得了不得，見了一茶缸現存的飲料，那是多麼的快樂，便把它飲入肚中，於是虎列拉，傷寒，霍亂等病源，也乘機侵入他們的腹中，識想，發作起來，所麼的危險啊</p>
<p>所以我要問設立茶缸的諸位先生提出一個建議，便是：「在茶缸上多配上一個蓋」，那末，越發功德無量了。</p>
<h3>濕令代茶妙品　橘皮</h3>
<p>— 缶鳴</p>
<p>「一杯為品，二杯為解渴的　物，三杯便是飲驢了。」賈寶玉在攏　庵里的話，但飲茶可以解渴，熱天增進人體的水份，一杯二杯，十杯八杯；只要生理上有此需要管他驢飲，牛飲又何妨呢？際此夏令，人體水份排出日增，加進飲料，亦爲勢所必然，現時代的飲料；如汽水果汁等，非一般平民所能享受，而物價高漲，就是茶葉，也不見得人人可以購用矣。我國習慣，客來奉茶，若用白開水，就以為寒酸。但現在不妨提倡一個折中辦法，改用橘皮替代茶葉。其法，取橘皮曬乾，用力切絲，（不問廣橋，福橘，　　密橘，只要是橘，其皮皆可用。）可以久藏不壞，取橘皮絲一撮，放入杯內，用開水沖入，數分鐘後即可取飲，其色澄綠，其味芬芳；若導入杯中敬客，誰也不曾相信是橘皮泡的。而它的功效，卻能理濕·導滯·開胃，久服有去口臭之效。</p>

<h3>夫婦之愛得進行曲</h3>
<p>因為社會進化的啟示，使我們相信：在最高等的社會裏，關於男女間的事，將特別注重愛情，夫婦之愛將被視為最可寶貴的生活經驗，而不再被人誹議而為人所羡慕了。不過，其間的事常自相矛盾。在真正可以自由戀愛的場合，男女們的心均將擴張，據心理學家的意見，一個浪漫的男子，他在隨時隨地渴求著像他祖先一樣能夠在新嫩的樹林裏發現那種自由，美　和奇遇。他的慾望張開了的一顆心，簡直可以容納一打以上的女人！女子雖沒有男子這樣的厲害，但她也會討厭夫婦間的永久關係，人家淫蕩的女人為水性楊花，如果不為禮教觀念所束縛，那個女子不水性楊花呢？</p>
<p>逃避是決不可以解決困難的。只有奮鬥才是解決困難最好方法。矛盾是進化中所必經的階段，有了矛盾，才有一致，正負相消，新個體即由此而生。愛情如果是我們所需要的，那就是竭力促其完成。男女們在愛情中慾望的張大，這正是他們在生命活力的表現。這種活力可以鼓勵他們勇敢，前進，使他們的生活快樂，安慰！假使夫婦而男健女美，又能懂得愛情的秘訣，使大家都能自由地把愛情情趣於一致，注意健康的增進來滿足他倆慾望張大時的要求而使愛情永恆，這是最甜蜜而幸福的！總之，夫婦之愛得增進與健康大有關係，著男子於早年犯有自瀆與遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱欲，把生命源泉的生殖腺液消耗過多，則凡滑精漏精，早洩陽痿，發育不全，精薄不育，神經衰弱等癥即相繼而起。此種病夫，不特因精力不濟，在職業與學術上毫無成就，為社會吐棄，就是在夫婦生活上，亦必不能美滿，為妻憎恨，致愛情破裂，接聽演出種種悲劇！這是男子咎由自取，何能怪妻子的水性楊花呢？欲嘗補救，必須根治此種暗疾。治法據世界名醫及余經驗，均以服生殖腺素製劑以服生殖腺素製劑[生殖素]最為對癥特效。因此劑品質貴重、功效確實、服後於一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，助長發育，繼續服用，必可於短期內根治上述各癥，並可使身體益臻健康。惟有遺精者須兼服[希米脫氏固精片]（五洲中西中法等大藥房有售）、以以固精關，制止遺洩則標本兼治，收效尤速！</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯在健美上的價值</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>靚裝畫眉學趨時，瘦骨嶙峋可恥！問響知否現代美？高乳肥臀逞嬌姿。</p>
<p>由於時局的動盪不安，所以現在孤島上很有許多從外鄉來滬避難的闊太太，闊小姐，她們一登十里洋場，正似劉姥姥初入大觀園，覺得目所見，耳所聞，都是千奇萬豔，蔚為大觀，而尤使她們歆羡不止，覺得急須模仿者。便是現代女性的新裝，她們認為既然做了上海人，必須學些上海腔，於是不管自己的身段如何，便燙是也，皮鞋也，錢袋也，短袖旗袍也。敷粉涂脂，畫面點唇，一朝改裝，居然出入交際場中，自鳴得意。豈知她們方在洋洋得意，而背後正有人嗤之以鼻呢！</p>
<p>這倒不是胡　，因為她們所注意者。僅是服裝，以為服裝一新，自然便好看了。其實不然，要知道現代人是所高唱的女性美，是高聳的乳峯，豐腴的臀部，以及織細腰身所構成的曲綫美，也就是健康美。而內地婦女對於乳峯發育素不在意，越是閥閱人家，束胸的越多，所以乳峯萎癟，臀部瘦削，健美喪失者，比比皆是，此等女性，即使穿上極華麗的新裝，總覺得瘦骨嶙峋，似乎套上一只燈籠殼子，寬大凌空，毫無肉感動人的美資，所以他們面貌無論怎樣嶄，裝飾無論怎樣考究，依然掩飾不了她們的醜！</p>
<p>要做新時代的女性們：請你們少費點無謂的裝飾之費，趕緊打從健美著想把，如乳峯萎癟，健美喪失的話，應立即以卵巢內分泌製劑女用均公認以服卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』，為彌補。蓋此劑係由美國聖醫斯丹那博士積三十餘年之艱辛實驗發明，複經歐美名醫多人之化驗證明，認為藥性和平，功效偉大，無論各種婦女隱病，均能在短期內統治全愈。如繼續服用，不特可使萎癟的乳峯，變成高聳，同時且能消減子宮疾患，促進妊娠代能，紅潤面頰，長駐青春。</p>
<h3>遺精日久何以會面黃肌瘦</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫生詹念曾</p>
<p>面黃肌瘦的青年人充斥在今日的社會上，他們並不爲了食不飽衣不暖的緣故，據我們的考察結果，大半是犯了自瀆與遺精。一個青年自十五六歲以後，因為生理的成熟，在生殖器官內由一種精液的產生，這是自然地現象。但此種精液平日　有於精裏，待營神聖的生殖作用的，豈可加以玩褻？不過，一般好奇而無知的青年，因為不能克制性的衝動或為惡劣環境所引誘，犯上自瀆者真不知有千千萬萬，更因自瀆的放縱，摧殘了性神經，馳鬆了精關，致繼起遺精者更不知凡幾。</p>
<p>患了遺精癥，有人醫喻為著了吸血魔，因為精液一滴等於血液八十滴的貴重，遺精一次等於失血一磅。那末、遺精日久致面黃肌瘦者，恐怕尚是一種較好的現象。精液是我們體內的生殖腺液，一部份由外道管而儲存於精囊，一部份就直接滲入血液、灌溉於全身·功能調整新陳代謝，旺盛發育機能，滋養各部神經。所以遺精日久新陳代謝必減退，在各組織中只有老細胞的死去，而甚少新細胞的產生，這怎能不使面黃肌瘦而呈未老先衰的現象呢？同時凡發育不全，神經衰弱，腎虧無能等癥亦難僥倖，所以說青年的自瀆與遺精等於慢性的自殺，這並不是過甚其詞。欲謀補救，必須服治遺特效藥服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，鎮靜神經，遺精可於當夜痊愈。因遺精已有上述徵象者，須兼服用生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以補腦補腎補神經並助長發育，調整新陳代謝，必可於短期內恢復美滿健康，患者能來本診所施用電療注射等法，則更可保證治愈。</p>

<h3>尿中忽然出血的淋病</h3>
<p>在吾輩醫家日常時所遭遇之淋病象中，有不少的病人，忽因尿中出血而莫名其驚恐。實則正亦不必作此大驚小怪，淋病而尿中出血，是淋毒性膀胱炎一症，恒所遇之也。而膀胱炎一症之成因，十之七八，由於行局部器械手術之結果，因爲不純練之手術，在行術時，淋菌往往自後尿道達於膀胱，因而侵蝕膀胱粘膜，遂發膀胱炎。此時之小便，全部溷濁，甚至有血尿迸出，最重者爲膀胱內出血淸。又因血管破裂口大時，則其所出之血淸，瀦留膀胱，而使尿液全作赤色。幸此種現象亦不恒見。而以一般而論，不過多在排尿時，因膀胱壁肌肉收縮的關係，而有少量之出血。至於膀胱中的出血情形，則　在　後。以其淋菌　　侵　膀胱頸部故也。此症之特徵爲下腹部，恥骨縫際感到刺痛，此刺痛在排尿時放散於陰莖之先端也。</p>
<p>治療此症，宜注意本症狀程度如何。有宜於膀胱洗滌法者，有宜於温罨法者，有宜於服用利尿劑者，而最新化學療法，對此症尤有特殊之功效。但是對於治療此症時所用之手術，仍須敏捷熟練，否則若更破壞創口，猶火上添河，變本加厲，故尿中見血之淋病患者，切勿胡亂擇醫，和濫服市上成藥，宜求有經騐而肯負責之醫師治之。</p>

<h3>金融　多頭趁髙出籠　金價大漲小回　頭盤出六百元關交易七百兩左右</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、變動範圍雖不若上日之大、而市勢則仍呈不定之象、蓋人心堅爲轉移、初時因國外銀行繼續猛跌、且外滙又報軟化、加以證券帮進意蓬勃、昂至二千六百零五元髙峯開盤、繼而因現金號趁髙吐售、兼某錢兌業將上日所進之多頭、悉數獲利出籠、致市象一度轉弱、會退達二千五百八十元低盤、入後終因人心向上、大戶提拉頗力、價重髙昂至二千五百九十六元、惟結果以二千五百九十元收盤、較上日續漲二十二元、交易尙旺、全天達七百兩左右、銀樓飾金亦先漲繼跌再漲、終則掛高二元、海關金仍平、中英純金等均略上升、</p>
<p>烚赤尙漲念二元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開承上日之餘風未息、且外匯報軟、及國外白銀銳落、加以證券帮忽止塞轉進、同時賣者奇缺、價因處於買風籠單下、狂抬三十七元開市、首由證券帮進現金號五十元、價二千六百零五元、繼而錢兌業賣予證券帮五十兩、價六百元、後現金號塞予錢兌業十兩、價六百零四元、時上日所進之某錢兌業忽趁髙獲利了結、市勢頓即向下、瞬跌九元、某銀號賣予證券帮五十兩、價為五百九十五元、繼又跌五元、某銀兌業賣予同業五十兩、及金號十兩、價均五百九十元、後又傾跌五元、某錢兌業賣予同業及銀樓帮五十兩、價均五百八十五元、時證券帮亦有賣意、故再降落五元、某錢兌業與證券帮各塞予某銀號五十兩、價均五百八十元、此後買風突又轉盛、且傳者均懷觀望、致市象重堅、未幾竟飛騰十五元、銀樓帮進現金號五十兩、價五百九十五元、繼而錢兌也互做十兩、價五百九十六元、後錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價五百九十四元、將近午刻、市勢轉平、金號進銀樓帮五十兩、及銀樓帮進某銀號五十兩、價均五百九十二元、爲午收價、午後交易突稀、趨勢平疲、開市即低二元、現金號賣予銀樓帮五十兩、價五百九十元、時散戶稍來供塞、續趨下游、錢兌業互做三十兩、價五百八十八元、俄再跌一元、金號互做二十兩、價五百八十七元、繼而散戶吐予錢兌業五十兩、價五百八十八元、時錢兌業吃胃頗佳、遂稍回髙、二時三刻金號塞予錢兌業三十兩、二千五百九十元爲晚收價。結果較上日續漲二十二元、全天二十五元上落、現金號之本牌金售出價二千五百九十五元、收進二千五百八十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢均鮮少做開、</p>
<p>首飾金更動三次</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初未更動、迨至九時五十二分、因烚赤開市堅挺、故均掛大三元、不久十時十五分、因烚赤突起回風、故亦回小三元、後至正午十二時、因烚赤潛勢重堅、故復掛高二元、此後未見變動、計大同行改懸二百六十三元、　同行爲二百六十一元、收進二百五十五元、</p>

<p>晨初以倫敦大條、近遠又猛跌七五、紐約銀價續慘落一分半、倫敦生金大半辦士、匯兌英對美小一釐三、對滬跌二五、對法未更、美對英小一二五、對滬降二角五分、對法縮〇六二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、</p>
<p>銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金爲六辦士六二五、美匯爲十二元九三七五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、乃英美開匯率回縮之故、開後油洋行等結款頻繁、且外行賣者淡薄、而吃胃則佳、致潛勢即緊、首由匯豐吸進日行與外電香港現貨英金爲六辦士六二五、繼而油洋行德士古與亞細亞等競相吸進匯豐現貨英金六辦士五九三七五及五六二五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉免徵、此後外行華大通某行又相繼吸購日行及華商現貨美匯爲十二元八七五及八一二五、時洋行結款仍繁、故潛勢愈緊、銀行會選過英金最緊爲六辦士五三一二五、美匯最軟爲十二元七五、將近午刻、日行又與西商沙遜相繼塞予孟買銀公司及外行等七月份英金爲六辦士二八一二五、並同月份美匯爲十二元二五、狀況亦緊、後洋行結進外行現貨港匯爲四十四元半、爲狀頗緊、延至午收、英美匯稍見回硬、銀行現貨賣價英金爲六辦士五九三七五、美匯爲十二元八七五、</p>
<p>午後市况稍轉平定</p>
<p>後市首由洋行續來扒結、匯豐現貨英金爲六辦士五九三七五、兼又結進大通現貨美匯十二元八四三七五、繼而銀公司賣予某行現貨美匯十二元八七五、市勢頗平、入後港電賣予外行七月份現貨英金六辦士三一二五、爲狀稍見回硬、後荷蘭塞予洋行現貨價仍爲四十四元半、狀况乏變、迨晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金六辦士五九三七五、美匯十二元八七五、結果較之隔昨午收、英緊〇三一二五、美軟〇九三七五、港匯照成交價軋過、亦賣六二五、</p>
<p>香港申匯上升三元</p>
<p>香港二十九日電、今日匯市晨開、市氣平穩、對英現貨縮〇三一二五、申匯上升三元五角、其餘均無榮辱、十一時三十分申匯縮五角、爲二百二十三元、午收行情軟緊、英匯現期各縮〇三一二五、現貨爲一先令二便士八一二五、遠期爲一先令二便士七八一二五、日匯亦縮一二五、爲一百零五圓七五、下午二時三十分開盤、市面轉平、各匯仍關午收原盤、至收盤亦無變動、</p>
<h3>封鎖津租界得經濟意味（續）</h3>
<p>— 顧孝</p>
<p>要挾外商銀行與偽鈔聯繋</p>
<p>華北「聯合準備銀行」成立后，發行「聯銀」鈔，但租界各外商銀行對於此銀行，均消極的拒絕合作，對「聯銀」鈔亦一致拒絕使用，雖有使用，對此項偽鈔，亦只能分別記帳，專用於對日貿易，而不能以此等聯鈔購買外匯，不但此也，同時在租界內外國商店三百餘家亦甯願犧牲營業。縮小範圍，而不用偽鈔，因此日方此次的封鎖，也有要挾租界外商銀行，和商店的使用聯鈔，和認聯鈔為通貨的成分的。惟事有適得其反者，津租界自封鎖後已下令在租界以內，一致不得再用偽鈔，以相報復，此諒為日方非初料所及的了。</p>
<p>掠奪租界內的五千萬白銀</p>
<p>存在華北的白銀，據估計在天津方面的，計有：</p>
<p>中國銀行　一八，三四九，九八一元</p>
<p>交通銀行　二〇，六一二，五九九元</p>
<p>計　三八，九六二，五八〇元</p>
<p>在北平的</p>
<p>中國銀行　六，五九二，三五九元</p>
<p>交通銀行　八，八六五，八六七元</p>
<p>中央銀行　一〇〇，三一五元</p>
<p>計　一五，五五八，五〇一元</p>
<p>平津共計　五四，五二一，一二一元</p>
<p>此項五千四百五十二萬一千一百卄一元的白銀，自平津淪陷以後，均存在天津英法租界內的中交兩銀行庫內，日方企圖掠奪，久存此心，在去年二月七日偽「臨時政府」希圖　取，組織所為京津兩市現銀保管委員會，」迫租界命兩行交出此項白銀，以為「接受，」英法租界當局，則堅持中立立塲，加以拒絕。三月間偽「聯合準備銀行」成立，又圖掠奪此項白銀，充發行偽鈔基金，然結果均不成，後日方又進而要求英法租界當局與日方共同組織委員會，封鎖該項白銀，但始終未為租界所接受，因此，日偽方面，迄今對於該項白銀，仍念念不忘，企圖掠奪以為快。</p>
<p>總之，以上四點，為日方封鎖天津租界的重大目的，因日本佔據華北將近兩年了，力量的不足，率不得完成其統治野心，竟因此而移怒於租界，其起因絕非起於偶然的，這次不過借了引渡人犯的問題為導火綫藉端起事，最終目的，係在完全擯除列强在華北整個的權益，此次的封鎖，不過彼實施計劃中的一步而已。（完）</p>
<h3>英美金鎊續昂</h3>
<p>昨日英純金漲半辦士、英美滙兌降一二五、本埠外滙洋行結款甚殷、外銀行供結暢達、市况先緊後鬆、結果英滙為六辦士五九三七五、計緊〇三一二五、美滙為十二元七八五、亦緊〇九三七五、烚赤開盤、承上日漲風、金號客戶吸納興奮、做二千六百零五元為最高價、入後錢兌業等趁高拋塞、浮多了結亦殷、且滙票回鬆、降達二千五百八十元為最低價、午收回堅、下午徘徊於九十元左右、交易旣稀、變動亦狹、晚收為兩千五百九十元、較上日高漲二十二元、外幣英美金鎊、需要尙殷、因烚赤高漲、市價俱升、英美金票供求頗盛、市價微降、香港票法郎票荷蘭票等、略有需要、微趨昂貴、日金票供給較增、市况鬆動、晚市為九角八分六厘、朝鮮票需要亦稀、價為九角、公會交易未盛、仁泰出勤泰進英金鎊十個、厚吉出承泰進美金票二百元、又出通源進美金票三百元、昨日市價、英金鎊升五角、美金票降一分、香港票升一分、法郎票升一厘、新加坡票升二分、荷蘭票升四分、澳金票升二角、其他各幣俱未更變、</p>
<h3>舊鈔漸少　多見新鈔</h3>
<p>連日市上盛傳各銀行所發出者、以舊時各商業銀行鈔票為多、但自近日來、則此種鈔票已屬罕見、不但如此、且多見新鈔票發出、足證雜鈔替代中中交鈔為無稽、而各銀行鈔票支付、力量充沛、不虞竭　、尤為明顯、蓋已數日於茲矣、惟小銀行固有不少困難也、</p>
<h3>餘風未息　銀價繼續猛跌</h3>
<p>二十八日倫敦電、銀市跌風加厲、印度及投機家競相塞出、市面不定、收盤後、照掛牌價高〇六二五有進出、大條銀、近遠期均又猛跌七五、紐約銀電、美現貨跌風仍熾、又暴落一分半、又孟買銀電、印銀市况愈疲、現貨猛跌二十五安那、七八月均暴落二十六安那、</p>
<h3>貼現步低</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、步跌未止、每千元上午為九十五元、下午退至九十二元、比前日再低三元、錢業公會之拆息、早午兩市均仍掛二角二分云、</p>
<h3>銀行今日辦理　半年決算　票據交換延至下午四點四十五分開始</h3>
<p>今日為銀行業依例辦理半年結帳之期、本市銀行業聯合準備委員會、為便利同業票據收解起見、特將票據交換時間、酌予延遲、規定自下午四時四十五分起開始、至於代收票據時間、仍照舊辦理、聞該會昨日已通函各行照理矣、（Y）</p>
<h3>證券　怡和股最活動</h3>
<p>衆業所股市、怡和股續為活動之股票、成交六千七百股、價在十九元與十八元七角之間、其他各項股票、市氣亦略有進展、見有多數買戶、出價亦略為平準、電車股成交四十元零七角五分、及會徳豐股略漲、價三十五元、大眾投資家及投機家似均採取觀望策略、以待天津事件之解決、但臆測歐洲局勢、最短期未見能吿結束、橡皮股市略見有需求、公司債券市面續呆滯、僅電力五釐半公債八十二元半、略有需求</p>
<p>倫敦英商遠東各公司股票本月二十八日（週三）掛牌行市、僅銀行股稍有上落、麥加利銀行股上升五先令、價為七鎊五先令、匯豐銀行香港註冊股跌落一鎊半、價為八十鎊半、餘無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債本月二十八日（週三）掛牌行市、善後借款英發債票回升一鎊半、價為三十二鎊半、其餘均無變動、買賣行市、善後英發買進三十一鎊半、賣出三十三鎊半、又法發有印買進二十九鎊、賣出三十一鎊、英倫實貨求售、計廣九路公債七千鎊、售價十五鎊半、照市抬一鎊半</p>
<h3>紗花　外匯復縮　現紗買風突起　雙馬地球狂漲念元之譜日紗交易亦已改收匯劃</h3>
<p>棉紗暗盤突趨上騰、漲風又見熱烈、而實際交易並未十分發達、蓋受運輸阻梗影響也、惟一般同業看漲觀念仍深、稍遇良好機會、即來拉提、於是抬力尤足、查上日二十支雙馬最低價曾達四百七十五元、昨則最高價見四百九十四元、相隔一日之間、狂漲二十元之譜、然客銷未暢、銀根亦不能立刻鬆懈、市場成交十包為單位占多數、查其上升之原因、謂外滙復縮至六辦士平、黃金稍昂、貿風復起、晨初開盤呌喊、買者為多、賣戶缺乏、開價即漲四元半、二十支雙馬外棧債為四百八十四元半、棧單價為四百七十八元、少頃氣勢又緊、以大戶之額、上日賣去不少、本日勿動、　商乾枯、多方聞消息稍好、紛紛收進、市盤步做步硬、迨至收盤、二十支雙馬儐為四百九十元、棧單四百八十五元、午後開盤再漲三四元、二十支雙馬現貨價為四百九十四元至三元半、棧單四百八十九元、查全日各幫買去統計七八百包、客帮僅廣東香港汕頭等帮、仍以同業成交佔多數、行情二十支雙馬漲十六元、雙地球漲十八元、牧羊漲六元、十支粗紗平堅、查棉紗昨有二百五十件、運香港、又四百五十件、運往海防、</p>
<p>現紗市塲因銀錢業辦理半年决算、市塲自七月一日起亦停市、至七月四日再開始營業云、</p>
<p>日紗市面稍露轉機之象、蓋以日廠鑒於貼現率旣昂、而市上現款尤缺、非順潮流不可、亦改收滙劃應用、以資推銷、於是走勢稍形活絡、市價略振、但銷塲仍平、二十支月琴紗現貨價為三百八十五元至八元</p>
<h3>本外棉交易　同人停頓之途　印棉大批到滬</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市晨初尙稱堅定、開盤時略漲二三鎊音、後因同業購買及孟買來電良好、而步入佳境、中途忽以白銀價格降落而人心因之頗為恐慌、且政府對於棉業新訂之立法、於同業交易頗多限制之處、而棉區氣候又傳良好、引起各方之了結及拋棄、收盤時棉價較日前跌十餘磅音而印度連間預測亦跌一羅比餘、埃及跌三五磅音</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、自二十二日政府限制提存以來、銀根日緊、交易日趨困難、而日來到貨日多、廠方均以籌款不易、日前暫無談新交易之可能、而洋行亦以滙票交割關係、本月與下月掉期損失過巨、莫不焦萬分、昨日某洋行竟派出全體職員、到各廠商檢收鈔票、同業中以籌款困難、將存貨賤價出售亦衆、</p>
<p>本棉交易完全陷入停頓之途、只包未嘗敞開、廠方在此法幣缺乏之際、亦不願有所舉動、且華廠方面大概皆有數月之需用之原棉儲藏、决無惶恐之象、至於同業成交之外棉、轉輾售於他廠、據多數行情稍見疲軟、蘇北來源亦不旺、碼頭到貨僅通州一百六十五包成交、同業進白洛去八百件、價八十八元五角、又進新特花二百件、價七十四元五角均現紗棧交、</p>
<p>印棉不斷輸華、昨又有大英公司「Rahore」號、自孟買裝來棉花二千七百零七噸、昨已抵滬、停靠浦東其昌棧起卸、又該公司之「Ghitral」號、自倫敦來滬、經過孟買時、亦裝來棉花八百八十二件。該輪原定二十五日到滬、因機件略有受損、乃在香港修理、業已工竣、於前日自港起椗來滬、約今晨可抵埠、預定停泊十一·十二號浮衝、起卸過駁（祖）</p>
<h3>疋頭　布廠多家　實行減工　匯劃票另加貼水內外廠已允出貨</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨布市現銷暗淡、售盤繼續下挫、客路川滇粵帮僅各有小額千餘疋成交、本街營業雖亦遜色、然還較客帮為佳、門市及江浙內路蚌埠等區零疋、雜類拆貨交易、續而不斷、本街批發號購進白貨粗布府綢綫呢色布色　洋紗印花貨一百餘件、各染織廠以出品銷路日蹙、咸謀停工或减工、已有多家實行、存貨亦頗願鬆價求售、藉冀减輕重負、以是引起同業及客帮乘廉購囤之意、惟銀根緊急、成交不旺、計成交嗶嘰直賣呢細布粗布等貨二百餘件、均現墊轉棧、市價混亂、白貨參差較少、比上日有跌無漲、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>白貨市場、因無實銷、交易冷落、惟一般賣空買空之流、迫於月底、勢難再延、大都相互結價、前日龍頭細布市盤一度壓小至十三元五角、但至昨日內外廠可以匯劃票出貨、雖需貼水、而照市得減少一二十元、售盤又復轉堅、多頭心思又來拖進、龍頭細布本月現貨增漲至十四元、下月份須十四元四角、成交達二三百包、二十九日運烟台布疋七十五件、</p>
<h3>糧食　小麥稍形轉機　麵粉尙難活動</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨現粉客帮交易、仍以廠盤堅售現鈔、一時尙難活動、除須要者少數指染外、迄無大額之成交、即本街方面、亦以六月底銀行半年結賬期、銀根現鈔俱緊、零批交易不多、二號粉廠盤暫無變化、大致須待下週銀行開關、再為决定、麵粉昨日有三萬包運天津、</p>
<p>小麥　昨新小麥來源、逐有零星抵埠、到貨以車麥為大宗、因船麥交易、不如車麥之便也、銷塲方面、廠冒岑寂、幸恃本街與國戶之垂青、市面已漸回蘇、蓋因貨主成本高昂、大都堅執上棧、以待善價而沽。不願再事賤脫、昨市回昂三五分、統計售開丹陽·太倉·崑山·南京·等共八百餘包、價為六元六角八分至六元五角半云、</p>
<h3>天熱易變　米價愈跌愈烈　銷塲祗本街一路</h3>
<p>杜粳　國米市自租界當局嚴令限價、及金融關係、一路回小後、昨則跌風尤熾、誠以囤戶覩市面祗有向下、而時屆夏令、米難久持、更以明後銀錢業從事結束封關三天、不約而同均相湧出、而經售方亦以急脫為快、相互追逐、但銷塲方面、僅本街一路冒口、致市面愈跌愈烈、結果厚薄粳續落二三角至四角不等、</p>
<p>客秞　昨日到頭須有二三千包、囤戶仍有售出、市面本居軟象、乃內地帮等聞杭州一帶米價猛落四五角、納冒轉淡、統市祗辦去砶米四五百包、本街各戶亦無暢　、總計成交不過三千包、行情立小二三角、其宿次發熱者會有較小三四角、惟杜羊尖及埠尖、市貨雖少、亦受粳米而步低二角餘、</p>
<p>洋米　新定西黃一二號米業經證實後、市塲空氣早見轉變、惟現洋米市上浮存不多、高西貢仍討價二十三元運費送到、但進戶以客秞價低頗少問津、</p>
<p>糯米　昨日變元米市情、因其銷路淡欓、故亦小去二角、香港糯米亦不振、小去三四角、現祗開十九元六角至八角、</p>
<h3>雜糧　各種豆米　各有銷路</h3>
<p>昨日雜糧交易大都仍是實在銷塲、其間有七月一日起銀錢業半年度結賬休假關係、良以各帮辦胃略見增加、致各種市况依然平穩、昨統計做開大連黃豆二百包、（行情詳市價欄）、漢口乍豆五十包、　定白皮　豆三百包、蕪湖白皮　二六十包、崇明潤片白皮　豆一百包、蕪湖毛豌豆三十包、張家口　豆一百餘包、崇明赤豆八十包、崇明苞米九十餘包、</p>
<p>豆子昨日由天津來四百九十包</p>
<h3>糖市　惠州白　開二十九元弱</h3>
<p>至糖市據外電、　蘭香港均乏更動、惟倫敦續　、八月份升七五、為八先令一辦士半、十二月份不動、　年三月份升二五、為六先令　辦士七五、本市公會劇盤、　二角、現貨四粗白本　十九元二角、外棧二十　元、轉口新到貨升至二十　元、太古軍白上檔升一二角、西棧B嘜二十九元、成交二百包、CW嘜二十八元八角、CX嘜二十八元半、DY及HX嘜均無上落、其餘車赤荷赤及本綿白等仍為原價、國糖有裕豐恒號開出惠州白二百餘包、較高者為二十七元八角至四角、次之二十七元一二角、昨日進口糖有一百包由天津來、又三百四十包由北海來、</p>

<h3>報紙·輿論·記者</h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>有人說新聞記者是無冕之王，這也許是太　恭維了。不過這句話正反映着輿論力量在近代社會的重要性，從而執掌着這一重要任務的新聞記者的責任，是不能僅僅視作一種單純的文化事業加以衡量的。報紙這一種東西，已經成了一般社會的精神生活品。一個近代人，不論他受的是怎樣程度的教育，在他離開學校之後，也許因職務上其他的原因而不再多看書，但却絕少補看報的——不管他關心的是社論或戲廣告，是政治電訊或桃色新聞。就是被認為文育或準文盲的下層階級人物，也不乏要聽聽「報士講些什麽？」（據我個人的經驗，前進的勞動者，比了一般人更熱心於看報。）</p>
<p>報紙在今日業已成了一般人民的教育工具——比了學校教育意義遠為廣大的教育。一個近代組織的國家，都有所謂新聞政策。一個政治運動或社會運動，沒有輿論的推動，根本不會成功一個運動。在平時報紙的重要性已經舉不勝舉，在一個戰時的國家，報紙的重要性是益發大了——換句話說，記者的責任是益發重大了。近代戰爭是所謂國力戰，不論是物質的或者精神的力量，都得動員參加戰爭。輿論就是一種不可小視的精神力量。交戰國間的宣傳戰，也就以輿論戰為主體。這種戰爭的範圍，反較實際戰爭的砲火為大。這裹表現了筆的力量，有時不但「如刀」，而且具有淩駕刀以上的影響。最好的明證，就是國軍離滬後一年半來上海的情形。四百萬上海市民的能始終為中華民國的忠義公民，我們是不能不估計輿論的力量的。</p>
<p>記者的職務，雖有其榮譽的地位，但我們曉得中國記者的一般生活情況，是並不優異的，有時且反不如較高級的普通職業。記得不久前申報上曾刊過一篇「馮炳南先生訪問記」，末了有一段馮先生對於記者生活的關懷，他說他晚年有二個志願，一即是建立一為平民謀福利的機關；另一就是想為記者設一遺族照拂的組織。這里可見記者的生活是很苦的，但職務却相當繁重。正唯因此，除了技術的條件以外，沒有較高精神修養的人，是不能勝任這種任務的。</p>
<p>寫到這裹，迴顧上海新聞界的內部現狀，值得歡喜之處固多，但　人皺眉的地方也是不少。把專門誨淫誨盜的下流小報（因小型報中也有好的，故特曰下流小報）除外，在一流二三流的大報中，實在也找不出幾張令人滿意的。經濟條件固然是一個重要原因，但從業記者的對於本身任務缺乏正確認識，也是不少的原因。據我個人的意見，記者本身的缺乏精神修養與學識修養，是造成報紙內容貧乏的一大原因。但這種現象並不足悲觀，中國是在變遷中，上海又是一個畸形的社會。任何正當事業，都有寄生蟲在，一時欲加剷盡，是社會條件所不許可的。我們僅希望新聞界的正式領導者和從業員，互相巖行監督和合作，以防止目前黑暗勢力日益向新聞界的進迫。</p>
<p>最後聲明一句，本文僅是夾雜一些建議的感想，絕無半點人的用意和作用——雖然感想是不無根據的。</p>
<h3>趕</h3>
<p>— 徐青</p>
<p>「老凌！振作起來呵！一個山灣就有村莊了。」</p>
<p>兩隻多毛的臂胳扶着我，我是頭昏，出汗，汗是冷的。我頭顫抖着，雖然這是個酷熱的夏天。</p>
<p>白雲躲在西天的角裹，原野是一片靜。</p>
<p>爬一個低崗，翻一個山嶺，沒有一道人烟，沒有一滴水。</p>
<p>「老劉！我快要倒了！」我喘着氣，像一隻打傷的野犬。</p>
<p>「老凌！不要急，你看那邊發光的水源，有水流的地方就有人家了！」</p>
<p>我睜着半昏迷的眼望了望，那邊羅列着兩個青翠的山峰，一道水銀樣的清流迎着高空的烈日，閃閃地發着光。</p>
<p>「那末，我們有希望了！」我笑了笑，精神也提起了，雖然這不過是個渺茫的希望。</p>
<p>老劉是我兩年來患難的同志，他的身材比我高過一個頭，闊肩膀與馬蜂腰差不多要成一個三角形，渾身的紫黑色皮膚，裹面包藏着個潔白的靈魂。他能負着受創的朋友走幾十里路，忍着飢餓分應饃饃給人家吃，而自己却裝得很安靜地說：「不！我儘夠！」</p>
<p>這次使命叫我們趕一段長距離的路，路是夠荒涼的，睜開眼，只一個老劉與一個我。在酷熱的太陽下，在北斗星的指示下，我們走着走着儘走着，腳底下起了不知多少泡。</p>
<p>「老劉！我頭昏得利害！」終於我昏厥在坡上了。</p>
<p>水，拍上了我的胸膛，拍上了額角，我又醒了。</p>
<p>就大量低飲起水來，飲完了我的水，飲完了老劉的水。</p>
<p>「老凌！振作起來呵！過一個山灣就有村莊了！」</p>
<p>我是頭昏，出汗，汗是冷的。</p>
<p>太陽御着山角，路上加上一重陰暗，暮熏中一批藍販子走下了山崗。</p>
<p>「譮！老鄉！借光！可有宿兒？」</p>
<p>那個為頭的漢子指了指說：「那邊不就是要嫁集！」</p>
<p>「好了！希望終於實現了！」</p>
<p>晚烟，在崗子後面冒了起來。</p>
<h3>願大家立定脚跟</h3>
<p>— 綸亭</p>
<p>暴風雨來了之後，至今還沒有去，反在加甚其惡勢力。在這時期，一不小心，便有跌倒的危險，或者誤入歧途，走到陷穽裹去。</p>
<p>惡勢力的所以為惡勢力，連三尺童子都是知道得明明白白的。除非是喪心病狂者，或者熱中富貴，不需要過過寵的，才會認賊作父，跟着惡勢力跑，不但跟着他跑，並且來推波助瀾，加增他的勢力。對於這種自甘墮落的人，我們自然仍舊希望他們會革面洗心，痛改前非，否則，國法和道德，自然也會來制裁他們的。</p>
<p>自甘墮落的人當然是少數。可是我們也不能否認，除了這樣的少數人以外，正還有許多人在這惡勢力日加其甚的當口，心頭發生了恐慌，腳跟隨之有些搖動起來。我不惜冒老生常談之嫌，要大聲疾呼說，願大家立定腳跟！</p>
<p>青年人大都是有血氣的。他們車費認事不眞，一認眞了，就會決然堅持到底，決不妥洽。現在，他們都已認清何者為惡勢力，他們決不會被他所屈，這樣，我除了稱讚他們勖他們以外，我完全放心，不要說別的話。</p>
<p>中年人我就有些不大放心。他們的認事當然也很眞的，可是他們大都担負着家庭的生活責任，在這生活艱難的過程中，他們不能力自掙扎，以求生路，爲了求生活，就不免要走上飲酖止渴的絕路。道眞是危險，我願他們麾下一個決心，不去上當，將要上當的，會懸崖勒馬，速即回頭才！最為難的是老年人。有些是一生不得意，要想藉此機會吐吐氣：有些是忘了「戒之在得」的古訓，要想來填滿他的慾壑。當然此外也有為着生活壓逼，而不得不然的。我要對他們說，這是死路，非但不能吐氣，反將遺臭萬年。這絕不能發財，挬入一定要挬出！</p>
<p>暴風雨的惡勢力在平明打擊我們，我們只有立定腳跟，拼命抵抗。短時期的不能勝利，終能獲得最後的勝利；一二個人的盡力而死，終能保全大多數人的挺然而生。我們不必擔憂，只要立定腳跟！似乎新的打擊在逐逐而來，某種意料中的壓逼也許果然就要出現，我們假使要做人，做一個仰不愧於天，俯不怍於人的人，我們立定我們的腳跟，不投降，不妥洽！</p>

<p>白天玄子唱着蓮花落：「要訪救國保民的英雄。」我給他看一張戰士的照片，他並不感覺興趣，好像有點失望似的。因為，沒有想像中的神奇。</p>
<p>自從我了解「一將成名萬骨枯」一語中的悲哀，對於英雄我便失去了驚異。喪火了幸業的英雄，遭遇總是不幸的。窮途末路祗能長聲太息，徒呼「天亡我也」而已。那位蓋世的英雄不也終於寂寞地死在聖勒那海島上嗎？</p>
<p>我們歌頌遺體，褒獎集體，孤立的個人永遠是渺小。投入集體，現身給集體，我們都是民族的英雄。</p>
<p>現在是集體的時代。</p>
<h3>無題</h3>
<p>— 恝栔</p>
<p>聽不見時鐘滴答，看不到日頭馳聘，天黑了，天又亮了。</p>
<p>草草地吞下食料，東西僕僕地奔走，額上汗珠怖得滿滿地；於是路在腳底下溜過，各式各樣的事情從手裹腦海裹逃掉，忘了，模糊了，勝下來只是些汗的斑痕，忙碌的喘息。</p>
<p>有時，生活也能像攀上高山，翻過峻嶺，涉越闊河，渡遍大洋那班深刻奧妙，理應永銘在心頭，但平鏡古井的意識，竟將奇幻輕輕地帶走！</p>
<p>終於逍遙自在地吞食，奔走，流汗！</p>
<p>於是時光的疾馳，茫然地送往迎來着。</p>
<p>無論什麽人都會有覺悟，越是模糊，終有一朝會感到清醒，憎惡過去的生命。</p>
<p>我不能例外，我也會很清醒，前途是牛角尖，繼續走下去，將狹窄得容身不下了。</p>
<p>汗的斑痕積得厚厚地，忙碌的喘息幾乎要透不轉氣來；人生漸漸地加老了，眼光，腦海一日日地遲鈍下來，結果將是極其可悲的命運，而且路也根本行不通。</p>
<p>我舉一舉自己的雙手，抬一抬自己的兩足，覺得它們還有些力量，足夠有別的行動。</p>
<p>趁腦海還可以磨練，眼光還看得見遠方，覓一條新的道路，思索一下如何前進！</p>
<p>仿佛又有人向我招手，不錯，光明大道正需要無數清醒的青年，是明證，是領導，只要自己的腳向前進！</p>
<p>聽見了時鐘的滴答，看見了日頭的馳聘，天黑了，天亮了，無論在任何一分一秒鐘內，都有了生命的價值！</p>

<h3>訪問舌畫專家黃二南</h3>
<p>— 蘭燕</p>
<p>明日在震旦大學舉行畫展　五時至六時當塲表演舌畫</p>
<p>舌畫專家黃二南到上海來了，而且已經住了半個月。昨天下午四時上海美術界特地假南京路新雅茶室歡迎他，我才有機會和他暢談了半小時。</p>
<p>我和他會見的地點是在中國飯店三〇四號，在座的還有他的二位女弟子。</p>
<p>他說着一口流利的北平話嘴唇上留着短短的　髭，臉色很紅潤，發音很宏亮，他自己說今年已經五十六歲的人了，精神比以前差得多，一幅八尺長的畫，從前兩小時內可以繳卷，現在却非得分兩天畫成，實在，這玩意兒太累人了。</p>
<p>黃先生呌他的女弟子放開一幅八尺長的舌畫給我們看，上面畫的一片竹石，是用三寸不爛之舌畫成的竹葉石塊，這的確是件艱苦的工作。</p>
<p>現在我且把黃先生發表的談話，詳細的寫在這裹。</p>
<p>舌畫三件困難</p>
<p>關於「舌畫」這一專門的技術，據黃先生說不是一件輕而易舉的工作，對於國畫沒有深刻研究的人，是無從畫起的。</p>
<p>第一：畫的時候，　靠一陣氣，嘴裹含的一口氣，如若沒有這股氣，是不能畫出什　東西來的。</p>
<p>第二：舌頭作畫的時候，眼睛離開紙不過一寸，眼睛已經失丟效用，這時你作畫只能自己先在畫幅上留着一個腹稿，不然你自己都不知道從何畫起。</p>
<p>第三：畫的時候，頭都不單要上下移動，同時還得左右搖擺，精神稍為不好一點，馬上就要感覺頭暈。</p>
<p>根據這幾點，你就可以知道「舌畫」的困難。</p>
<p>怎樣畫舌畫？</p>
<p>舌畫的畫法及事先的預備，據黃先生說很簡單，就是，先用白蘭地酒漱了口，然後飽含一口墨汁，在預備好的紙幅或綢絹上用三寸舌尖揮武起來</p>
<p>我問黃先生，關於彩色畫怎麼辦法，黃先生表示，他用的顏色都是中國顏料，所以畫的時候可以不成問題。就是一種黃顏色（膝黃）是有毒質的，所以不能入口，他在北平的時候，協和醫院有位醫生送他一種無毒的黃顏色，可惜現在這種顏料已經用完了，一時還找不到代替的顏料。</p>
<p>當過騎兵旅長</p>
<p>黃先生是「七七」事變以後離開北平的，他的家屬現在還在北平。當事變以後，他倉惶的離開北平的時候，身邊只帶了六十塊錢的旅費，但他沿路經過的地方，如大同，晋南，西安，成都，一直到昆明，再到香港，然後再到上海來。這一路上，他在西安成都為難胞災童及各學校獎學金作畫的數目，總數總在四千元以上，而他自己所用的旅費費用，則有六千元。</p>
<p>黃先生是主張為災童難胞多畫一點力的，不過在內地，實際說在猛烈的空襲之下，誰還有意思買畫？但為了各地的朋友藝術家，美術家，戲劇家的　塲，介紹總算也為國家畫一分力量。</p>
<p>兩個展覽畫會</p>
<p>黃先生是十一年以前在上海的，由表面看，上海似乎還沒有多大的改變。上海的老朋友，如從前南社的柳亞子等還沒有會見。昨天會見的上海中西畫家的很多，他很高興。</p>
<p>他到上海雖然有半個月，但很少出去，主要的他正趕着為震旦大學畫了五十幅畫，那是預備在七月一日舉行展覽會用的。黃先生還預備親自表演「舌畫」，時間是五時至六時。門劵的收入及畫買下來的錢，準備做震旦大學煌「獎學金」。</p>
<p>等震旦的展覽會期滿了以後，處洽卿及袁履登諸先生，預備假寗波同鄕會為黃先生舉行一個展覽會，收入的半數，將撥給災童。可是日期還沒有決定。</p>
<p>關於他自己學舌畫的經過，已經有十幾個年頭，開始學的時候是民國十七年，初期畫的題材是竹石，後來才畫由水，花卉，雀鳥。</p>
<p>他自己從前一向是在軍隊裹的過着戎馬生活的，他曾經當過騎兵旅長，以一個軍人資格，而轉變成為一個「舌畫」的專家，這似乎是很有趣味的事</p>
<p>兩幅新奇的畫</p>
<p>他昨天在旅舍裹又畫了兩幅很新奇的畫，畫法是用花卉的花瓣及枝葉的顏色畫原來的花卉，（是用手指畫的）比如畫玫瑰花，就用玫瑰花瓣及玫瑰枝葉來畫，不必用旁的顏色，畫出來的玫瑰花還是紫紅玫瑰，青綠的枝葉還是原來的顏色</p>
<p>好在明天黃先生的展覽會就得開幕，歡喜瞻仰黃先生舌畫的，不妨到震旦去參觀一下</p>
<h3>黄二南先生之「舌畫」</h3>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十三回　勸學務晨儲材為國　留強汰弱選種有塲</p>
<p>這時朱愛人問道：『阿爹！（蘇人哆種父之稱）你說我們今天來看地開設工廠，是第三起了。那末第三起是誰，我們倒沒有知道。』朱村長道：『你一天到晚，忙於醫院裹事，自然不知道。第一　，在半年前已經簽定了租地契約，此刻廠屋也已經造成　了。那是一個造紙廠，這個造紙廠，並不是大規模的。倘要造什麼　報紙的那種捲筒紙等等，那是要大規模，大資本的，這裹區區小地方，也不够使用。我們在浙江蘭裕那邊，不是有一家紙廠，專造捲筒報紙的嗎？這裹的一家是小規模的，他們的資本，聽說也只有五十萬元。他們是半機　，半手工的，專造日用所　的紙品，以竹木破　為原料，銷行到，內地去的。現在中國的用紙愈多，從前有許多都是用的外國紙，每年進口實在不少。此刻我們有許多的紙品，都出自造，挽回　　很多。最可笑的，以前我們見那舶來品太多了，也是嚷着要抵制外貨，　　國貨。寫標語，發傳單，紛紛擾擾。但是仔細一看，這寫標語　發傳單的　　，就是外國貨，這可　　　呢？現在他們那個廠，注　於日用品所需的紙，一半是用手工的。我很贊成，因為中國有如許多的人口，手工葉是要極力提倡呀。』何家兩位小姐聽得很有興味，便說道：『那末自由村將來要開設許多工廠咧，因為這裹水陸交通，很為便利呀！』朱村長搖着頭道：『這也不能！為了這件事，我們村中，也開了好幾次會議。有一件議決案：在十年之內，這個自由村，不許建築工廠，超出了十個數目。而且這些工廠，都要是屬於輕工業的，每一個工廠的設立，也都要由我們村中審查過，是否有害於本村。因為近來有許多工廠，雖是輕工業，也是以妨害地方上的。譬如說：他們是化學工業，這化學材料，是否有毒質。他們怎樣的排　法，倘然那個排　的澱質，是有毒的，而流入水流中去，是不是有害於村民嗎？又如烟　裹的烟，漲漫在天空，如何使村民不覺得討厭？又如機器的聲音，一天到晚，隆隆然不絕於耳。更有生意好了，廠裹開夜工，是否有妨村民睡眠，都要想到。』（一四九）</p>
<h3>懲罰另一種罪犯</h3>
<p>— 美喬</p>
<p>一個搶刦的盜犯是會受到懲治的，然而現在有許多人的刦掠行為却沒有受到懲罰。</p>
<p>一個房屋業主當租出房子的時候，要開門錢；一個二房東轉讓房屋的時候，串通大房東賬房，要一大筆頂費；尤其是一個二房東，以五十元租來的房子，一層統樓就要六十元的租金。租界當局會限制房租高漲，但受限制的只是大房東，二房東們却公然勒索，驅逐房客，強迫加租，好像他們住在一個毫無法紀的社會上一樣，因為他們還沒有受到懲罰。</p>
<p>應當指出的，是受他們剝削的都是中下層的人物。他們有一半甚至大半的收入要用作房租，且問那一個社會有這種畸形的形象？房東們犯了詐欺取財之罪，但他們不惟沒有受到處罰，反而他們本身彷彿就是法官，得以任意強迫加租或驅逐。</p>
<p>現在有誰替上海這無數三四房客伸冤呢？　然，這責任是兩租界當局應當負起的。目前應當創立一個組織，專門解決房租問題，讓房客們的痛苦得以伸　，讓社會的　賊，那些公開的刦犯得以懲治。我們已看到許多關於房租事件而打架，兇殺，涉訟的案件了，現在生活程度已愈見提高，而房東們亦跟着更加毒辣起來，我們在這方面應當也來一次「安全第一」的運動，我們相信這「安全」較之馬路上的「安全」更加要緊，更為多數人所關心，更有裨益兩租界的治安和秩序。</p>
<h3>「我愛水手」</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>“Give　me　a　sailor”</p>
<p>這位環黛維絲第二瑪莎蘭，好像去年會榮膺美腿比賽的冠軍，所以，在「我愛水手」中，這位「十三點」小姐不但能唱會鬧，導演者也穿　了「榮膺全國美腿比賽會冠軍」，特　腿部特寫等。從這樣生發點而攝製的「我愛水手」，其內容就可以想知了。</p>
<p>我們會看過不少關於「軍棱」的電影，雖然千篇一例，都是崇掦軍校的威嚴，和鼓勵青年為國效勞，但是這嚴正的主題終究是值得稱崇的，如「赤子丹心」，寫一個戰事中逃避的軍醫官，他後來慚愧去見他在軍校肄業的兒子，這種對比的寫法，正足以鼓勵人心，而使鼻子上抹着白粉的人們，感到慚羞的吧？</p>
<p>可是一寫到「水手」生活的電影，不是「歌舞」，便是「胡鬧」，這張「我愛水手」，就是從海軍大砲口徑下滑下來而展開一對兄弟和一對　妹的滑稽戀愛。其實瑪莎蘭是個能演戲的演員，如果編劇和導演能放棄這種不是「生意眼」的「生意眼」，而給予她一個能充分演戲的機會。</p>
<h3>「兒女債」</h3>
<p>“Boy　Trouble”</p>
<p>兒女成羣的父母常常被人羨慕為「有福氣」，而做父母的也謙遜地表示「都是討債鬼」！從這里可以看出中國人都是把兒女當作一種私有的「財產」。</p>
<p>「兒女債」雖然並不針對着這問題，但或多或少把兒女當作私有財產如以諷刺的。荷馬和溫迪發生衝突以後，溫迪就認為荷馬是思子心切的緣故。而荷馬太太到孤兒院去領了佐意回來，恰恰給予荷馬更多的麻煩；然而最後荷馬終於把他們認領下來。</p>
<p>因為却利羅吉士這一角色的決定，導濱者是把「兒女債」純粹寫成一個喜劇的；可是平舖直叙，使全劇　得非常鬆懈</p>
<p>却利羅吉士的荷馬，不能說壞。兩個孩子也都能演戲。</p>

<h3>史太林看過我們的戲麽</h3>
<p>— 李斐叔</p>
<p>梅邊雜憶之四　（二）</p>
<p>在進膳時，我們在什麽需要，便這位招待員作翻譯。關於海參　的風土人情，他也不厭求許的告訴我們。趕到飯罷，越談越有精神！由選座旅館的命名（且尼司金是只探險船的名字）面談到北極探險，由探險面談到西北利亞的森林，由森林而談到集體農場與工業的發展，進而至於五年計劃，又進而至於世界大勢，由世界大勢突然轉過舵來談到中國的問題，特別是中日的問題，歷歷如數家珍！滔滔如決江河！足足談到十一點多鍾。這才興盡而散。想不到抵俄的第一晚，便上了「蘇維埃的第一課」。團員郭君建英，他以爲蘇聯的教育太發達了！一個普通的雇員，竟認識　　至如此！但是我疑心，疑心他是國際警察局的一位秘密偵探，而且恐慎還是一位宣傳員呢！于右任先生也爲說過：「俄人招待游客與新聞記者，皆其黨中經專門訓練之能者任之。」所以我們打定主意，把我們的自身，作爲收音機，耳聽可，口頭呼諭則不可。</p>
<p>梅先生自到蘇聯趕到出境止，有蘇聯對外文化委員會的派員招待，在梅先生的汽車上，更派有一位「保　大漢」，那人的身體魁梧，沈默寡言，他祇會說他本國的評議，至於英語，德語，中國語，據他說一概不懂，讀者！他真不會說外國語言嗎？不！他非但能英，法，德，各國評議，中國的官話　語，也無一不能，無一不精呢！我們如何發現的呢？在梅先生離開莫斯科之先，因爲他終日隨從左右，保護週密，梅先生穎給以若幹金錢，作爲他精神的酬勞，他卻拒絕不受！同時他卻要求第先生送給他簽名的像片，以及關於中國戲劇的書籍，在這時人，他所說的卻是很流利的中國話，什麽「謝謝！」謝謝儂呀！說來極是暢順！梅先生大爲驚異！問他：「你到過中國嗎？爲什麽說得一口很好的中國話呢？」他，這神秘的保鏢者的回答，卻是「笑而不言」。</p>
<p>當我們在蘇聯的時候，（一九三五春）托派份子以及所謂「紅蘿葡」尚未完全肅清，（紅蘿葡外皮是紅色，內裏是白色，用以代表「白俄之表面服從蘇維埃者」，這種人在西比利亞最多，都是放逐到那邊去的，當我們列車經過西比利亞的時候，一到日薄崦嵫，車窗的絨幕，必須掩起來，以防襲擊，但是在一去一來的過程中，還是未能免俗，受到兩次磚石的光顧，險些將大琴師徐蘭沅又光雙亮的腦袋打出血來，自前年嚴厲清黨之後，這種情形也許沒有了。）所以梅先生的車上，不能不有保鏢，以免危及上賓。同時也許寓有監視之意，再探視探視外人對於社會主義的起初評論究竟如何？（蘇聯深切瞭解「當面的評論」是虛僞成分居多，「背後的評論」才是真實的。）其實我們平時所得的印象，（以民劇爲主要）背後的評論，可議者十之一二，可譽者十之八九，所以以對於他們所派偵探，不問如何的嚴密？自問祠堂無疚於心。</p>
<h3>如是我聞之言菊朋</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>今之言禮派　生者，叔宕病嗓，雙　特故，祇　有言菊朋譚富英二人，富英好固好矣，以經驗功候論，似不及菊朋，是故菊朋賞爲晚近唯一譚派　生矣，菊朋爲票友下海，藝有今日，良昇易易，茲略記其小史，以補簡文「送乇迎吉」之不足。</p>
<p>言菊朋原名㚌，爲前清松文清公筠之嫡曾孫，兄弟三人，菊朋最幼，自幼即好皮簧，民二供職於　　院，當與侗互　（博西園）遊。時向侗五請益，旋乃拜侗五爲師，其間蒙第一齣戲，爲戰蒲關，是爲菊朋學藝之初，時老譚（鑫培）方出演故都，每逢譚有戲，菊朋必到，風雨無阻，設無聽戲之資，難向友人借貸，亦並聽過明白不可，其人迷譚之深，概可想見，菊朋聆老譚戲，用心非凡，凡聆一戲，唱詞身段，皆堅記不忘，歸而向侗五請益，侗有時則轉請錢多福，王長林，王瑤卿等，對菊朋加以指點，以二王一錢，皆嘗與老譚配戲故，菊朋得錢等之指點，實得益不秒，民六七間，陳彥銜旅居舊京，與菊朋成莫逆，陳問研究譚藝最有心得者，菊朋之藝，本已有相當根底，加以彥衡爲之說戲，藝乃大進，當時菊朋偶以票友姿態（海報貼言菊朋君）客串一二日，輒哄九城，蓋當時北國人仕，對菊朋多以「老譚第二」曰之也。菊朋初次來滬，遠在十年以前，是年梅（蘭芳）程（硯秋）同時海上。菊朋則隨蘭芳同來也。當進菊朋雖仍貼，言菊朋君。」實際上則已拿包銀正式下海矣。</p>
<p>菊朋有一時期，紅得不可閒交，但正因菊朋之紅，中間嗓間竟起變化，至於起因，一則是公債投機失敗，財與命相運，菊朋受刺戟過人，一則是從於嗜慾，把嗓子弄得一塌糊塗，再加上他家庭一度發生許多事故，大好一條嗓子，就　起變化。菊朋在不得已情形之下才有所謂「言腔」之發明「言腔」雖亦能受一部份人士之歡迎，但終久不及「譚派正宗」值錢，以致近十年來，菊朋悶不得志，聲譽地位反不及譚實英馬連良輩。</p>
<p>今則菊朋早已戒除一切嗜好，嗓間恢復十年以前之有氣味，菊朋學譚，垂三十年，可謂晚近黎園中學譚最具心得之一人，雖扮相難看，武工稍欠根底，但手眼身法步，無一不佳，尤以口　之清澈，咬字之凖確，爲餘子所不及，菊朋將於今夕登台黃金，愚作斯文，以爲愛護菊朋者告，更期菊朋能真傳譚氏之衣缽，則不但傳譚有人，實亦觀衆之佳音也。</p>
<h3>時代劇塲坤伶台柱汪夢蘭便裝小影</h3>
<p>— （榮甫）</p>
<h3>書塲近訊</h3>
<p>— 津脩</p>
<p>營業一般不景氣，夏令對於書場，原是一個「淡月」的季節，所以有許多書場，例有「歇夏」的辦法。因爲書場取資低廉，一切設備，類多因陋就簡，少有什麽冷氣電扇（就是有，裝置的數目，亦決不能多）等設備。聽客不而枯坐在悶熱的斗　中，因此每到夏冷，營業例有一度的衰落，現在上海各書場，七成座者，已不多儭，夜場賣座更清。「湖園」夜場，已續停　「怡苑」且被迫改唱「女子文戲，即書場　領袖之　泉　，亦不得不減少檔數，縮短時間，但今夏書場營業之特別蕭條，還有一個極大的原因，就是物價　貴，生活程度　　提高，而進出書場的，十九是中下階級的人物，他們感當生活困難，不得不從事節約。　　書場就少跑了。</p>
<p>黃異庵行踪之　，黃異庵以善唱西廂，馳聘書場，自虞山朱蘭庵附道　夥誅後，西　一　，只有異庵一人，物以稀爲貴，黃遂得大走紅運，名噪一時，近忽　地向所做各場子「剪書」，且行踪詭秘，消息紛紜，有說臥病，有說開碼頭到當熱，甚至有聯想到桃色方面者，老聽客因重視西廂，遂不免愛屋及烏，對黃之去向，倍極關心。</p>
<p>文素臣悄然離滬，文素臣迫上海游藝界，原是個大紅物紫的人物，無論在平劇或越劇的場子上，到處都受觀衆熱烈的歡迎；某影片公司且有進而攝製爲影片的計劃，可謂盛極一時，保有書場上唐再良在「湖園」「怡苑」開講的文素臣，卻到處碰壁，不大受聽衆的歡迎民，甚至且　以「抽　」的倒採，文素臣不堪此種侮辱，遂不得不悄然離滬，別謀出路。</p>
<h3>袁美雲再顯身手</h3>
<p>袁美雲在電影界的歷史很長久，然而她主演的那一部片子最受人歡迎，不消說大家都知道是一九三六年的「化身姑娘」，因為袁美雲在這部片子裏反串小生，把頭髪剪掉，穿了西裝，以致閙得滿城風雨，真是別開生面的　劇，何况又加上了韓　根關安達這一對寶貝，於是　頭格外出色。而觀眾也就格外歡迎，所以第二年袁美雲又拍「續集化身姑娘」，不　情形還要熱烈，簡直人人都知，個個喜看，弄得袁美雲欲罷不能，今年不得不再顯身手，以　眾望。如今「三集化身姑娘」已在新光上映，並且「三集」的材料特別豐富，如此說來，真是不能不看了。</p>
<p>袁美雲（左）王乃東（中）汪洋之表情</p>
<p>— （逸）</p>
<h3>阿英重寫「不夜城」</h3>
<p>阿英，編寫的「不夜城」，逼去曾經由青島劇社在新光止演，賣座成績相當好，不過，阿英覺得這個劇本有許多地方還需要充實和修改，現在，應上海市保險業業餘聯誼會保聯劇團之請，決定重寫一遍，預備在上海職業界話劇義賣公演中由保聯演出</p>
<p>保聯劇團上次因爲一部份團員沒有時間在晚上排戲，退出阿Q正傳，而擬單獨排一多若蟲劇參加義賣公演以後，劇本幾經揀選，始決定排演「不夜城」，商請阿英同意，重新編寫，寫演也由阿英負責聘請，大概不是於伶就是陳西禾也許將由他自己擔任，劇本日來正在趕寫中，月底可以脫稿。</p>

<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>這個原因，就是因爲他們都是皮黄的底子，所會的戲大約百分之九十全爲皮黄，附帶研習三五齣崐劇，只算是應應門市，藉眩其博學而已。那能像西園先生他所揀的崑劇不下百齣以上，當然對於字音都異常凖確。也有人説：溥老固然崑劇兼擅，但比較言之，還是崑曲高於亂彈，此話究否有當，不佞因爲所見溥先生釁演的機會很少，那就不敢下定論了。現在梨園界的老伶工可算凋零始盡，老淚典型已不可再見，西園先生不但算是環寳，並且也稱得起是內外行裏的唯一導師；因爲他是得多，會得多，而况文武崑劇無所不能，倘使真想下苦工未研習劇藝以備將來出人頭地的話，捨掉這位好導師又有誰可請教呢。</p>
<p>電影公司宜請尚和玉攝製影片</p>
<p>在七七事變以前，中央文化會曾有約請武生泰斗楊小樓攝製影片的提議，當蒙一致通過，倘使戰事未起，中央攝影場必已派大北上與楊接洽進行的辦法了。當時提議人的理由，就是因爲近來國産的古裝片頗能得到中外人士的贊許，同時楊氏的長靠戲如「長板坡」「覇王别姬」「挑華車」「鐵龍山」等，都是代表吾國古代英雄大將的作品，攝成影片之後，不但可以留爲後學的楷模，並且還可以運往國外及南洋諸地映演，俾友邦仕女也能在銀幕上覘知中國戲劇藝術一斑；至於中國古代大將的風度，尤非由小樓扮演，不足以表現出來。可惜這個計劃尚未實現，楊氏已經作古，這未免是件很大的遺憾。所幸與楊並駕的尚和玉老闆，現仍健在，論起他的藝術，除嗓音·扮相·略遜於小樓外，要講他的武工功架，恐較楊氏還要嫻熟老鍊。他雖是年歳較長，但他並無嗜好，故而老當益壯。——（四九）——</p>

<h3>The Anglo-Japanese Negotiations in Tokyo</h3>
<p>London dispatches frequently report: Regarding the Tianjin issue, the British Ambassador to Japan and Japanese diplomatic authorities will seek a solution in Tokyo. According to unconfirmed reports, Japan's demands on the Tianjin Concession include three key points: (1) to search for Chinese anti-Japanese elements within the concession, so that the concession will no longer be a base for anti-Japanese activities in the future; (2) in North China finance, the concession must cooperate with the Japanese side, that is, the concession will no longer support Chinese legal tender, and will accept the circulation of counterfeit currency; (3) existing silver in Chinese banks within the concession, valued at 48 million Chinese currency, will be handed over to the Japanese side. As for the extradition of the so-called four suspects, which was the immediate cause of the Tianjin case, it seems to be set aside for the time being; even if it is not mentioned in other Anglo-Japanese solutions, it is already undeniable that the two sides do not regard this as a problem today. Moreover, the British public is indignant about the humiliation suffered by British nationals during the blockade, and this is indeed the focus, which also does not seem to be of concern to the Tokyo negotiations; the British authorities probably believe that the past humiliation was "deserved," and only seek to be exempted from future humiliation.</p>
<p>On the eve of the start of these negotiations, according to the attitude taken by the British newspapers, as reported by Reuters, they are generally "welcoming with cautious words, but with strong suspicion"; our feelings are the same. In fact, on the surface, the United Kingdom has always advocated that the Tianjin issue be resolved through negotiations as a local incident, so it has endured humiliation that no nation can tolerate; now, after more than ten days, negotiations are expected to begin, which can be said to be a masterpiece of Mr. Chamberlain. The authorities' response to the questions from the members of parliament was to show a slight pleasure, and their feelings can be imagined. In fact, any international issue should be resolved through negotiations; the UK's proposal for negotiations has naturally not been rejected by Japan; if the UK now regards Japan's agreement to negotiations as a sign of Japan's compliance, it is too much of a "misunderstanding." The problem is not in the negotiations, but in the outcome; the UK's main view lies in the outcome of the problem as a local incident. What is a local incident? In terms of the statement made by the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin when they blockaded the British and French concessions in Tianjin, such as the so-called issue of concessions in China, and the so-called issue of aiding China's war of resistance, these truly exceed the scope of local incidents, and the British side has stated that they can never be accepted; however, if the above-mentioned three key points of the Japanese demands all state that the Tianjin concession should be how it should be, does the mention of the Tianjin concession not mean that Japan has also recognized the local scope? Will the United Kingdom accept it because it is limited to the local scope? If so, the United Kingdom's so-called local incident is a case of self-deception; why? If the negotiation of the Tianjin issue is limited to the Tianjin locality and accepted, flowing down the stream, Shanghai is also a local issue, Gulangyu is also a local issue, and even Hong Kong, Singapore, and India, none are not local issues; under the blockade of force, in the policy of appeasement, not only will local ways be unblocked, but the world will be at peace. This is by no means an exaggeration, Japan is most adept at dealing with weak countries to obtain "local" solutions; before and after the September 18th Incident, it also had the most extensive experience in obtaining local solutions in China; when China was determined to resist aggression, it first announced a "full-scale war of resistance" to its people, which was aimed at the so-called "local solutions."</p>
<p>In making this statement, we do not dare to belittle the United Kingdom for being so weak; the other day, British Major General Knowles questioned in the House of Commons: "Will the Prime Minister insist, at the beginning of the negotiations, that the interference suffered by the British nationals in Tianjin should be absolutely terminated; will he declare that the patience of the United Kingdom in the past two weeks has been greater than that endured by any great power in the world in history?" It can be seen that it is not only we who are worried about the UK's excessive weakness; and Mr. Chamberlain's failure to answer this question shows that the worry has a source. What is somewhat comforting is that the United Kingdom also adheres to three points in the Tokyo negotiations, we are told: (1) The solution to the Tianjin case is limited to Tianjin, which is the so-called local incident theory is not worth mentioning, because Japan's original intention was not necessarily to encircle Tianjin in order to encompass Great Britain; (2) The Tianjin concession maintains neutrality in Sino-Japanese relations and maintains the integrity of its authority within the concession; (3) The solution to the Tianjin incident must not harm the United Kingdom's entire Far Eastern policy. Whether the authorities in power in the United Kingdom are adhering to this remains to be proven by the facts; if what is said is true, then it is strange that the United Kingdom has not resolutely raised the second and third points as principles, but still included them in the so-called "local solution."</p>
<p>Negotiations are about to begin, or perhaps even in the middle of negotiations, we are both worried about the weakness of the British authorities and suspect that the negotiations will inevitably have no achievements. The future of the Far East depends entirely on the outcome of the Sino-Japanese war, so the Anglo-Japanese parties, at least on the Japanese side, do not want to make any decisions about the future before the end of the war, unless all their demands are met; this is one reason. Japan's demands on the Tianjin issue may be small, but its hopes are extravagant. What it extravagantly hopes for is in conflict with the United Kingdom's vaunted Far Eastern policy, and the United Kingdom is naturally unwilling to openly belittle itself; this is a second reason. Various views and strategies within Japan are inconsistent; what the military does not want to accept, Tokyo does not dare to compromise; what the military hopes for, Tokyo may not be able to implement through diplomacy; this is a third reason. The United Kingdom's patience and weakness do have their limits, and Japan's contempt for the United Kingdom in recent years has far exceeded the limits of the United Kingdom; this is a fourth reason. The success or failure of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations is fundamentally related to Japan's attitude towards the United Kingdom; now the success or failure of the Anglo-Soviet negotiations is still uncertain, which is seen by Japan as an excellent opportunity to wait and see and to extort concessions; and the United Kingdom's repeated concessions to the Soviet Union have further increased Japan's obstinacy towards the United Kingdom; this is a fifth reason. The United Kingdom is trying to find the moderate faction in Japan as its opponent, thus falling into a fundamental error in strategy; the United Kingdom believes that showing favor and enlisting the moderate faction in Japan can increase the political influence of the moderate faction and facilitate the success of Anglo-Japanese negotiations; in the eyes of the Japanese extreme right, the United Kingdom's attempts to appease the moderate faction are a clear sign that the United Kingdom is afraid of the extreme right, which is a reason to adopt a tough attitude towards the United Kingdom, and also a counter-evidence that the moderate theory is insufficient to promote Japan's prestige; therefore, every concession, every compromise, will inevitably make the Japanese moderate faction speechless and make the extreme right elated; now, the United Kingdom still believes that it is following the diplomatic path, taking the moderate route, to explore the key to solving the Tianjin issue, but it does not know that its plan is wrong; this is the sixth reason. Only these six reasons will lead to protracted negotiations and delays in reaching a decision. And what the United Kingdom must do urgently is to ensure that milk and bread continue to be imported into the Tianjin Concession without interruption.</p>
<h3>British Consul to Japan for Negotiations; Situation in Tianjin Gradually Easing; Chongqing Groups Send Telegrams to Comfort Chinese in the Tianjin Concession</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The body searches of foreigners here have been greatly relaxed, but the businesses of British nationals and foreigners within the British Concession are still at a standstill. According to a certain British national, Japan may have a large-scale war with the Soviet Union, so the Tianjin dispute between Britain and Japan is easy to resolve. According to a certain British banker here, Japan's demand for the British side to cooperate and support its "United Reserve Bank" banknotes is impossible. (Reuter's telegram, 29th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Japanese army has blockaded the British and French Concessions in Tianjin for more than half a month. The various trade associations and women's cultural circles in Chongqing City are greatly concerned about the fact that compatriots in the concessions are in dire straits, and have sent telegrams of condolence and encouragement to fight to the end. (Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Tianjin incident, people close to the Foreign Office here said that the United Kingdom does not intend to change its current general policy in the Far East, especially its policy on Chinese currency. The 48 million Chinese currency in Chinese banks in the British Concession should not be handed over to the Japanese side, because Chinese financial issues are not only related to the United Kingdom, but the United Kingdom's policy towards China is also part of the United Kingdom's entire foreign policy. When Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie holds talks with the Japanese authorities, he will treat the Tianjin case as a local incident and try to resolve it, so that the Japanese side does not use this case to change its policy towards China. In short, the principle of maintaining the neutrality of the British Concession in Tianjin can be accepted by the government, but the United Kingdom must maintain the integrity of its authority in the concession. (Havas telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times has commented on the upcoming negotiations between the United Kingdom and Japan on the Tianjin incident, with a rather optimistic tone. Its words are as follows: "The British and Japanese authorities announced yesterday that negotiations will be held in Tokyo, which is indeed what we are pleased to hear. As for the issues to be discussed by both parties, although the Japanese authorities said that they will not be limited to the extradition issue of the four Chinese in the Cheng Xigeng case, the scope should also be limited to the various issues related to the Japanese army in North China. Regarding this level, it should be clarified after the negotiations begin. As for the demands that Japan may make, some of them have been rejected, and some are difficult to accept. Although it is impossible to know how it will be resolved in the future, judging from the current situation, the fact that the negotiation venue has been moved from Tianjin to Tokyo shows that the Japanese diplomatic authorities are very willing to seek a peaceful and reasonable solution, because the situation in Tianjin is extremely tense. If negotiations were held there, they would inevitably fail. If so, the extremely serious development caused by the local dispute would be unavoidable." (Havas telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops of the Baizhen Company Fail to Invade Southward</h3>
<p>Xingji: The Japanese troops who invaded southward on the Baizhen Highway have recently been moving in and out of Zouzhen. The Japanese troops who retreated to Henglingguan were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army along the way. Japanese corpses are piled up like mountains in the Majiashan, Yanjiashan, and Liulinli areas, and a large number of baggage and military equipment have been abandoned, all of which have been seized by the Chinese army and are currently being inventoried. The remnants of the Japanese army are relying on the stronghold of Henglingguan and artillery fire to cover their retreat northward in disarray. The Chinese army is pursuing in several directions.

<p>(Chongqing) According to today's Chinese military dispatch, 10,000 Japanese troops in the Jiangxian area of ​​southern Shanxi are currently attacking Jicheng in three routes, attempting to encircle Yicheng. The Chinese side has formulated countermeasures according to the predetermined plan. In Jiangxi, because the rise in the water level of the Fu River hinders the construction of Japanese defensive works, the Japanese troops in Maqiushi (transliteration) have withdrawn to the west of Maqiushi after being fiercely attacked by the Chinese side, and Maqiushi has been recaptured by the Chinese army. The Japanese have suffered heavy casualties. (Reuter's telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Over a Thousand Trucks Delivered to China Last Month</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to reliable Chinese sources, more than 1,000 trucks arrived in China last month. The second batch of trucks this month, with more than 500 vehicles, is expected to arrive in China this week. These trucks are mostly purchased by China from the United States, including products from "Dodge," "Ford," and "GMC." According to people in the transportation industry, it will take at least two years for all the trucks purchased by China to arrive completely. (Reuter's telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Japanese "Manchukuo" Planes Repeatedly Invade Outer Mongolian Territory; Soviet Deputy in Japan Recalled Home; Japanese Newspapers Claim Diplomatic Relations Severed</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Fifteen Japanese "Manchukuo" air force bombers, escorted by fighter planes, again flew back across the border yesterday, invading Outer Mongolian territory in the Lake Buir area. The Mongolian-Soviet defense forces immediately responded with anti-aircraft artillery and fighter planes. The Japanese "Manchukuo" bombers then indiscriminately dropped several bombs without clear targets and fled without engaging, hastily retreating to "Manchukuo" territory. (TASS dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Fifteen Japanese "Manchukuo" bombers, under the protection of several escort fighters, again invaded Outer Mongolian territory in the Lake Buir area today. The Soviet-Mongolian air defense forces immediately responded with anti-aircraft artillery. The Japanese "Manchukuo" planes indiscriminately dropped many bombs. When Soviet-Mongolian planes took to the air, they dared not engage and immediately fled towards Manchuria. As a result, the Soviet-Mongolian anti-aircraft artillery teams shot down two Japanese planes, both of which crashed in Outer Mongolian territory. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Deputy Representative to Japan, Smetanin, has been recalled to the country for consultations. Responsible figures here recently stated that this matter is purely for ordinary official reasons and has no special significance. Deputy Representative Smetanin has been stationed in Tokyo for a long time, exceeding two years since leaving the country, and it is only natural that he should return for a visit. Furthermore, it is not clear to most people here why air battles have been constantly occurring recently in the Lake Buir area on the border between Mongolia and "Manchukuo." The area is desolate and uninhabited, and airplanes seem to be the most suitable combat tool. There is no official information on the number of Soviet troops in Outer Mongolia that can be considered credible, but there is at least one infantry division and one motorized brigade, totaling about 25,000 personnel. The population of Outer Mongolia is 900,000, which can supply 100,000 combatants. As for the transportation situation on the "Manchukuo"-Mongolian border, a railway has been built within the "Manchukuo" territory, running from Changchun to the Heilongjiang Jiashan (transliteration) area on the border. On the Outer Mongolian side, there is only a highway running directly from the Lanut area to the border. Up to now, Japan and the Soviet Union have been taking diplomatic actions. However, Soviet People's Commissar Chairman and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov recently made a speech, saying that the Soviet Union is prepared to "stop Japan's provocative actions against Outer Mongolia," which is extremely noteworthy. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, Japanese newspapers reported that Soviet Russia has effectively severed diplomatic relations with Japan in Tokyo. Since Soviet Ambassador to Japan Slavutsky was recalled home, Soviet Deputy Representative Smetanin has been acting as head of the embassy and has now also been recalled, leaving the Soviet Union with no diplomatic representative in Tokyo. Only a few lower-level staff members remain. The Yomiuri Shimbun reported that the Soviet embassy's nameplate, written in both Japanese and Russian, has now been removed. Smetanin plans to leave Tokyo for Dunka on July 5th and Dunka for Vladivostok on July 7th. (Associated Press dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Reuters Special Correspondent's Dispatch from the Manchukuo-Outer Mongolia Border, 28th: This reporter traveled to the front line today, traversing the area previously attacked by Soviet and Outer Mongolian planes. I neither saw Outer Mongolian planes crossing the Manchukuo border nor heard any news of this. However, news from the Lake Buir area stated that several small air battles occurred today. Last night, a Soviet fighter plane was shot down and burst into flames upon crashing. The pilot ejected with a parachute and was captured. I then met with him, but he was badly burned and severely concussed, making it impossible to obtain any answers through questioning. I only learned that his name was Traminski, and he was 23 years old. There is currently an atmosphere of unease here, and a land conflict may be imminent.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to information obtained by the Associated Press, the fighter planes currently engaged in combat with Soviet planes on the "Manchukuo" border are a new type of aircraft developed by the Japanese army through painstaking efforts. Although these planes may still be difficult to compare with the latest European and American models, they are unprecedented in Japan. Although these planes underwent a combat trial in the Changsha area this spring, they were then moved to "Manchukuo" to determine the victor. This led to the news of the Japanese shooting down 42 Soviet planes on May 28th and the news of 56 Soviet planes being shot down again on June 22nd. Although this news may be exaggerated, there must be some truth to it. It is said that the model for this new type of aircraft was supplied by Italy and incorporates features of American planes. Although its speed and combat efficiency are not as good as the latest European and American models, it marks a new era in Japanese aircraft manufacturing history. It is said that at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War, the planes used by Japan were mostly of the 1935 model, which had been discarded by European and American countries. Later, although Japan formed an anti-communist alliance with Germany and Italy, Germany and Italy were unwilling to share their exclusive secrets with Japan. Therefore, Japan's new planes this time were still developed by itself. As for the planes currently used by Outer Mongolia, they are mostly of the 1936 model and have become outdated, making them inevitably inferior in comparison. (Associated Press dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>British Foreign Office Sends Memorandum to Germany: Naval Agreement to Be Scrapped If Germany Does Not Abide by Naval Construction Ratios; Denies Pursuing a Policy of Encirclement Against Germany; Ready to Revise Agreement with Germany Openly</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The British Embassy delivered to the German Foreign Office last night a memorandum from its government regarding Germany's announcement of its abandonment of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and other leaders, upon learning of this matter, immediately convened a meeting to carefully study the document and distribute its contents to various newspapers. The first critical report published today by the Völkischer Beobachter adopted a completely negative attitude, stating that the British communication contributed nothing to peace and only proved the justification for abandoning the agreement. The newspapers pointed out that the memorandum was drafted in a "provocative manner," only denying the policy of encirclement and mentioning the willingness to negotiate with Germany in a single, unfriendly sentence. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the German government presented a note to Britain on April 28 declaring the Anglo-German Naval Agreement terminated, British Ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, recently delivered a memorandum to the Foreign Office in response, stating that Britain's current policy has no intention of encircling Germany. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>Contents of the British Government Memorandum</p>
<p>(London) After the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was declared terminated by Germany on April 28 of this year, the British government recently instructed its ambassador to Germany, Sir Nevile Henderson, to send a memorandum to the German Foreign Office, stating: "If Germany becomes involved in a conflict of a warlike nature in any part of Europe, Britain will initially not necessarily adopt a hostile attitude towards Germany, but if it is not Germany invading another country, then it is a different matter. Germany's note of April 28, pointing to the guarantees provided by Britain to certain countries as a political decision, should know that these guarantees can only be implemented when the countries concerned are attacked by Germany. It is evident that Germany's note, referring to Britain's current policy as a policy of encircling Germany, has no basis and is a misunderstanding of Britain's intentions, which must be urgently corrected. The matter of a certain place being incorporated into Germany, no matter what reasons the German government gives to explain it, has already caused significant anxiety in all aspects. The actions taken by the British government after the occurrence of this kind of situation are only aimed at assisting small countries so that they feel safe and enjoy independence, as a means of dispelling anxiety. The right of these small countries to enjoy independence is no different from that of Britain or Germany. Britain is willing to accept certain constraints in order to achieve this goal, but its nature is limited to the day the country is invaded. To say that the British government intends to restrict the development of German trade is also not true. On the contrary, the current Anglo-German commercial payment agreement is actually beneficial to Germany, and the British government is willing to engage in further discussions with Germany to improve its economic situation if the main prerequisites can be realized. What are the prerequisites? That is, establishing mutual trust and goodwill. This is a necessary condition for conducting fair negotiations with careful thought and calmness. In short, what the British government is constantly thinking about is not to promote a war against Germany, but to lay the foundation for relations between Britain and Germany on the basis of mutual recognition of each other's needs and respect for the rights of other countries. The British government's adoption of this policy and attitude has always been the case in the past, and there have been no changes recently that would justify Germany's termination of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement. As the British government sees it, the main goal of the establishment of this agreement was to find a way to stabilize the naval situation in order to avoid unnecessary competition. If the German government says that the agreement has other purposes, then there is nothing to be found in the text of the agreement. It is a pity that the German government did not ask the British government to jointly study the actual situation and abruptly terminated the British naval agreement. Even if the German note only wants to express the German government's views and not as a notice of termination, it should not have been issued before the exchange of views between the two parties. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement is enough to dispel useless competition and avoid military expenses. Even if the relationship between Britain and Germany is not good, it is not enough to constitute a reason for terminating the agreement." The British government hereby declares its readiness to hold consultations with the German government in order to establish a "clear and practical understanding" on a solid foundation. [If Germany is no longer bound by the ratio stated in the agreement (the ratio of German naval tonnage to British tonnage is 35 to 100), then the British government's previous planning for its own required naval power will also be difficult to continue to use this as a standard and will no longer declare it invalid. On the contrary, if Germany intends to negotiate another agreement to replace the Anglo-German Naval Agreement after terminating it, then how the German government considers the scope and goals of the new agreement to be appropriate, the British government is eager to know one or two things. What is particularly important is the following two points: First, when does the German government think it is appropriate to conduct discussions? Second, what kind of suggestions does the German government intend to make so that the effective period of the new agreement, whether revised or declared terminated, will only be done after both parties agree.] (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>
<p>German Newspapers Comment on the British Memorandum</p>
<p>(Berlin) The first reaction of the German newspapers to the British memorandum on the termination of the Anglo-German Agreement does not believe that the British attitude "contains a strong intention and confidence in conducting negotiations." The newspapers all said, "Regarding Germany's position, Führer Hitler made a speech on April 28, clearly expressing his willingness to open the door to negotiations and clarify misunderstandings. On the contrary, Britain has failed to clearly accept this proposal. Today's British memorandum avoids mentioning the main topic, and re-restricts Germany's claims. It also does not clearly answer the issue of the scope of each other's naval interests. According to this scope of interests, it has been damaged by Britain's policy of encirclement. Today's British memorandum, in addition to giving a vague answer, also condemns Germany for plotting against small countries. This is truly of no help to clarifying international disputes." (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the British government's memorandum on Germany's termination of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, it has recently been sharply criticized by newspapers here. The National Socialist Party's organ, the Völkischer Beobachter, commented, "The British memorandum did not give a concrete answer to Führer Hitler's parliamentary speech, stating that although Germany terminated the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, it is still willing to establish an understanding with Britain and clearly redefine each other's scope of interests. This is a manifestation of the weakness of the British memorandum. Does Britain really want to continue to use the naval agreement as a tool to restrict the naval armaments of other countries?" The Hamburger Fremdenblatt commented, "If Britain still holds a skeptical attitude, it will be impossible to generate this kind of belief in order to promote world peace and the welfare of the people." The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung commented, "The British memorandum still does not understand the facts of German policy. It is important to know that Germany does not consider Britain to be Germany's enemy. Germany is willing to avoid interfering in the British Empire, but on the condition that Britain also does not interfere in Germany. Now it is not the case. Britain is intent on pursuing a policy of encirclement, with the intention of obstructing Germany's efforts to eliminate the Treaty of Versailles. Today's British memorandum still does not express the sincerity of engaging in negotiations. Britain claims that its policy is aimed at dealing with aggressor countries, but in fact, this definition is not precise. Before a conflict occurs, how can it be determined who is the aggressor and who is the aggressed? It is impossible to judge until after the fact. Now Germany uses these words to question Britain, how will Britain explain itself? Therefore, Germany interprets Britain's policy as a 'policy of encirclement,' which is very consistent with Britain's conspiracy." (Haitong dispatch, 29th)</p>

The geographical location occupied by the town of Kemi is of utmost importance in military strategy. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>German and Italian Air Forces Agree on Joint Operational Methods; Organizational and Technical Issues All Settled; Italian Undersecretary for Aviation Valle Returns to Rome</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Italian Undersecretary of the Air Force General Valle came here for a visit and held talks with the German authorities. He has recently completed his business and flew back to Rome today. German figures here all said that the nature of the talks was important and the process was extremely friendly. A cooperative style has been formulated for the air forces of Germany and Italy. The semi-official German News Agency also commented on General Valle's talks with General Göring yesterday, saying that the two sides conducted talks in an extremely friendly atmosphere for two hours. General Valle, based on the agreement previously negotiated by German Air Force Chief General Milch with the Italian authorities in Rome, continued discussions with General Göring. Immediately after, it was decided that various organizational and technical issues of the air forces of Germany and Italy should be thoroughly resolved jointly by both sides. From now on, the close cooperation between the air forces of the two countries has been completely determined. (Havas dispatch, 28th)</p>

<h3>Italian Prime Minister and German Führer Meet Secretly; Somewhere on the German-Italian Border</h3>
<p>(London) The London Times correspondent in Rome recently reported that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler met some days ago at some place on the German-Italian border.

<h3>Churchill Advocates Anglo-Soviet Alliance; European Situation Will Stabilize, Japan Will Be Respectful</h3>
<p>(London) Churchill said in a speech at the Carlton Club in London today, "I see that Italian propagandist Gayda is supporting the German propaganda minister and is extremely sarcastic about us because we have not gone to war with Japan because of the humiliation suffered by British expatriates in Tianjin. What I am pleased about is that the government has not hastily shifted its goals due to provocation. Japan has always prided itself on being polite, but now it has this public insult, which is probably a trap to induce us to lightly leave the location where the main problem can be resolved. We should not lightly send a fleet to the Far East until we are certain of our position in the Mediterranean, and there is hardly any need to send a fleet to the Far East until the position in the Mediterranean is stable. Because once the position in the Mediterranean is stable, we will see the Japanese being respectful. The Japanese are now deeply mired in thorns in China, bleeding all over, and their strength is greatly reduced in this wrong and impossible task, and the entire gravity of the Soviet Union is pressing down on North China. At this time, to say that Japan is willing to go to war with the British Empire before it is sure how European events will proceed, I do not believe it. Therefore, we should support the government's patience and firmness on the troublesome issue of the Far East." Churchill continued that he attached great importance to the situation that Europe will encounter in the next three months, because Germany may not yet understand its position properly to this day. What we must tell the world is that Germany's attack on Poland will be a decisive and irreversible event. Any act of violence against Poland, whether it comes from within Danzig or from outside, will create important problems that will affect the whole world. Foreign Secretary Halifax has announced the use of force against force. He feels that the meaning of this statement should be carefully considered by Germany. If the misunderstanding of its attitude towards Britain is not dispelled, the crisis is worrying, but he does not believe that war is inevitable. Although examining Germany's preparations, the tone of the German newspapers, and the remarks of the National Socialist leaders, it seems difficult to escape the conclusion that war is about to happen and will happen soon, there is still hope, that is, if Hitler knows that Britain and the British Empire have reached the extreme of patience, he may change his mind. Finally, Churchill advocated an alliance with the Soviet Union and warned the audience that the next three months would be the most tense period in Europe. (Reuters dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>Dangerous Situation in Danzig; Poland Intensifies Defense; Danzig City Prepares for Wartime; Polish Border Builds Tank Defenses; Polish Navy Gdynia Harbor Crowded; Demonstrations; President Mościcki Speaks, Determined to Defend Territory</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Today is Polish Navy Day. Government officials have all delivered speeches, saying that Poland is determined to defend its territory. President Mościcki delivered a speech in the capital, saying that Poland must defend the sea route and must use all its strength to prevent the seizure of the Free City of Danzig. General Kwaciszewski, chairman of the Maritime and Colonial League, also delivered a speech to the crowd at Piłsudski Square here, saying that Poland is determined to defend its interests in the Baltic Sea. Afterwards, the military band played anti-German songs, and the crowds marched in formation, holding flags with slogans such as "The ocean is the space on which our lives depend" and "We will never withdraw from the Baltic Sea." When passing through the streets, the residents gathered along the way and cheered loudly. They then participated in a Mass on the banks of the Vistula River and swore an oath: "We swear to defend Poland's sea route with all our strength and will never withdraw from the Baltic Sea." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The issue of the Free City of Danzig has recently been commented on by political figures here, saying that this issue, from whatever point of view, is of extreme importance to Poland. If Germany can occupy the city of Danzig, it will not only have a significant impact on land strategy, but the Baltic Sea will also become a German lake, and the country can further colonize the entire central Europe. But at this moment, if Germany intends to change the current system in Danzig, the Polish army will resolutely resist it. This is what German Führer Hitler is aware of, and he will continue to pursue his usual policy in the hope of managing the land without war. The method it adopts in Danzig is a gradual means of encroaching on Polish rights in all aspects in secret. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: It has recently been learned here that 4,000 Germans secretly entered the Free City of Danzig last night from the province of East Prussia in many heavy trucks to join the volunteer corps organized by the National Socialist Party in the city. In view of the seriousness of the situation, the Polish government is rushing to build fortifications in the area connecting the city of Danzig. A tank defense line about 20 kilometers long has been built from the port of Gdynia to the city of Danzig. In addition, most of the Polish navy's warships, including several torpedo boats, have also been concentrated on the sea off the port of Gdynia. However, the general public believes that German Führer Hitler may not act rashly and use force to annex the Free City of Danzig, so as to cause war. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Polish Port of Gdynia: Today is Polish Navy Day, and a celebration ceremony was held here. Cabinet Councillor and Finance Minister General Kwiatkowski, Minister of Industry and Commerce Roman, and many other cabinet members participated. More than 50,000 people participated. Minister Roman immediately delivered a speech, saying, "At present, our country's economy is developing day by day. Therefore, the ports of Gdynia and Danzig must be expanded. Our country's activities on the ocean have no intention of threatening other countries, but only [to maintain] the position it deserves." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: After the news of the National Socialist Party's military preparations in Danzig came, there was no sign of any surprise among the people here. The Polish press all asked whether an incident would occur there. Although there are various rumors in Warsaw that an incident will occur, the attitude of the general public can be summarized in the two words "vigilance." Polish President Mościcki gave a radio speech yesterday, saying that the two seaports of Danzig and Gdynia have a very important relationship with Poland's national economy. This is why Danzig has had many important connections with Poland for centuries. Mościcki concluded by saying that the above two seaports are freely open for merchant ships of all countries to come and go. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Singapore Conference Results Satisfactory; Lieutenant General Tai Ho Speaks</h3>

He hopes to meet on time to review the overall situation. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons this afternoon that the results of the meeting between the British and French army generals stationed in the Far East in Singapore some days ago were very satisfactory. "Its content is the same as the talks with the British and related countries' general staff and is not suitable for announcement." What can be said is that the methods for the complete cooperation between the British and French navies, armies, and palaces in the Far East have been decided. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Canada Youth Conference</h3>
<p>Winnipeg, Canada - Five hundred representatives of 500,000 Canadian youth are scheduled to hold the fourth annual Canadian Youth Conference here tomorrow to study the world and its future. The conference symbolizes a miniature League of Nations, as the four-day event will include most religious groups, all classes, and dozens of ethnic groups. The Governor-General of Canada, Lord Tweedsmuir, declared at the pre-conference meeting that universal youth had never encountered such serious problems before. However, he believed that Canadian youth possessed the courage, perseverance, and adventurous spirit necessary to cope with these problems. He warmly praised their endeavors and extended his most sincere congratulations. The only major organization not affiliated with the conference is the Catholic Youth League, which withdrew from the conference in 1938 when the Young Communist League joined. The Canadian Youth Conference will divide into five groups to consider youth work in agriculture, industry, citizenship, Canadian unity, and Canadian peace policy. (Reuter, 29th)</p>

<h3>New British Proposal: Revising the Conditions for Mutual Assistance Among the Three Nations; Soviet Legislators Accuse Britain and France of Deliberate Delay</h3>
<p>(London) French Ambassador Corbin met with Sir Alexander Cadogan of the Foreign Office. French Foreign Minister Bonnet received British Ambassador Sir Eric Phipps in Paris. Both discussed the content of the instructions telegraphed by the British government to Ambassador Seeds yesterday. The French government reportedly suggested that the new British proposal should be slightly revised in wording so that the British position could be thoroughly explained and to dispel any doubts on the Soviet side. As a result of the discussions, opinions on both sides converged. The final instructions will be telegraphed separately to the two countries' ambassadors to the Soviet Union tomorrow, so that they can jointly continue negotiations with the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs. According to general knowledge here, the British proposal advocates that (1) if one of the three signatory countries—Britain, France, and the Soviet Union—is attacked, (2) if any European country that one of the three countries deems necessary to protect is attacked, then the three signatory countries should automatically implement mutual assistance. If the Soviet side still considers this proposal unsatisfactory, Britain would not object to explicitly naming the countries to be protected. However, they should still declare to the Soviet authorities that this is largely inconvenient and may only weaken the strength of the European peace front. In short, if the names of the Baltic countries are explicitly stated in the tripartite mutual assistance agreement, then the names of Switzerland and the Netherlands should also be included. Regarding this, the Soviet side may raise objections because these countries do not have normal diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet legislator Zhdanov published an article in today's Pravda, criticizing Britain and France, especially Britain, for the slow progress of negotiations on the anti-aggression agreement among Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Zhdanov stated that although the Soviet government has strived to achieve the early realization of the agreement, there has been no practical progress. The current state of negotiations shows that Britain and France do not want to conclude a treaty with the Soviet Union based on the principle of equality but only want to establish a treaty that would make the Soviet Union bear all the obligations alone. Any self-respecting country that does not want to be driven by others and pull chestnuts out of the fire for others will never accept such a treaty, let alone the Soviet Union, whose power and reputation are known throughout the world. In his view, Britain and France do not want to establish a genuine treaty acceptable to the Soviet Union but are merely making empty talk of negotiation to blame the Soviet Union in front of their domestic public opinion for being unwilling to compromise.

<h3>Foreign Minister Wang's Broadcast to Europe: Japan Actively Promoting Anti-Foreign Movement, Will Eliminate European and American Interests in China</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui broadcasted in English to Europe at 6:15 AM on the 29th from the Central Shortwave Radio Station, titled "Japan's Policy and the Future of the Interests of the Powers in China." The gist was that the Sino-Japanese War is approaching two years, and China is becoming stronger as it fights, which has plunged Japan into a quagmire. In order to eliminate European and American interests and fulfill its ambition to monopolize East Asia, Japan has recently been actively promoting an anti-foreign movement in the occupied areas. Currently, Britain is the main target, hoping to divide the countries and defeat them individually. Japan's long-standing policy of dominating the Asian continent has been fully exposed in the Tanaka Memorial and other diplomatic documents. It has now begun to implement its southward advance policy, successively occupying Hainan and the Spratly Islands as bases for its southward advance. Therefore, the territories of Britain, France, the Netherlands, the United States, and other countries in the Pacific are all threatened. Recently, it has also been actively pressuring the concessions of various powers in China, hoping to achieve its goal of encroachment. Westerners should clearly understand that Japan's aggression against China is also aimed at the countries of Europe and the West. The Japanese army has now announced the complete blockade of China's coastline, restricting joint ventures and trade with China by the powers, and the Yangtze River has been blockaded for more than a year, with no hope of opening. The current problem facing the powers, in short, is whether to maintain or abandon all treaty interests in China. Past experience has fully proven that the Japanese warlords, based on their traditional aggressive policy, will never tolerate the existence of the rights and interests of third countries in China, and attempting to compromise with Japan is tantamount to seeking skin from a tiger, which will not only fail to resolve the Far East crisis but will also lead to further demands from Japan. (29th Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui issued a special broadcast to Europe this morning, stating that the powers are now faced with the important question of either maintaining or abandoning their treaty rights in China. In his view, compromise is not a lasting solution because the aggressor's established policy is to monopolize Asia as its exclusive possession. The facts of the past two years have proven that accepting one of Japan's demands only leads to new demands on a larger scale. The undeclared war has now become a movement to seize foreign concessions and drive out Western interests. Foreign Minister Wang continued that Britain is currently being singled out by the Japanese side as a target of attack, hoping to use this strategy to alienate the powers involved in the Far East. However, the flames of the anti-foreign movement instigated by the Japanese will sooner or later spread to the doorsteps of other powers. It is very clear that destroying foreign property and investment is part of the goal of Japan's "New Order in East Asia." The Chinese people are extremely resentful of the insults and atrocities suffered by the British and are grateful for the sympathy given by the world and the material assistance provided by peace-loving countries. Foreign Minister Wang appealed to the people of Europe to assist China in maintaining the principles of democracy, freedom, and the rights of others. Foreign Minister Wang further strongly advocated boycotting all Japanese goods, refusing all Japanese commercial orders, terminating all Japanese financial transactions, and prohibiting the shipment of military supplies to Japan, all of which would help curb aggression.

<h3>Strive to Reduce National Memorial Days</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Reuters' sources in responsible quarters, the rumor that the Chinese government intends to issue a nationwide order to hang the national flag on July 1st, the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government in Nanjing, is incorrect. It is said that although that day was previously designated as a national memorial day, the government has now decided to make May 5th the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's assumption of the presidency, and at the same time, it will also be the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government. Because the country is currently in dire straits, the government is willing to reduce the number of national memorial days as much as possible. Therefore, it recently issued an order to the entire country that in the future, for all national memorial days, the people of the country only need to observe the memorial days promulgated by the government.

<h3>American Democratic Congressman Criticizes Neutrality Law; Majority of Congressmen Tend to Restore Neutral Status in International Law</h3>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Congressman Alexander, known for his anti-Japanese stance, launched a strong attack today on Bloom's Neutrality Law bill, believing that the bill only benefits Britain and Japan. It benefits Japan because it allows Japan to purchase arms and military supplies from the United States, while China, because it has no ships, is unable to purchase them. According to Alexander, the great threat to the United States is not Germany or Italy, but Japan. Japan's goal is to use American arms, weapons, and military raw materials to conquer China, dominate East Asia, and then attack the United States. Alexander believes that the Bloom bill is not only pro-British and pro-Japanese but also biased and oblivious to the facts, and is not worth taking. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the Neutrality Law issue, the amendment proposed by Bloom, Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, (advocating the abolition of the current provisions on the embargo of arms and authorizing the President to designate belligerent countries and war zones) was continued to be discussed by the House of Representatives. Democratic Congressmen Shane and Leahy said that it would be better to have no Neutrality Law than to have an incomplete one. Republican Congressmen applauded in approval. Republican Congressman Barton said that any Neutrality Law is difficult to perfect. We will never allow a single American soldier to go abroad to fight. (Congressmen applauded enthusiastically.) He also said that if we prohibit the transportation of arms to Britain and France after a war breaks out, the public opinion's reaction to the embargo will be difficult to resist once London and Paris are subjected to air raids. Judging from today's discussion, the majority of Congressmen advocate restoring the neutral status prescribed by international law, still allowing arms to be transported to the belligerent countries, and completely abolishing the current Neutrality Law, only retaining the current methods of monitoring and obtaining licenses for arms exports. If this important amendment is accepted by the House of Representatives, it will still be possible to extend credit loans to the belligerent countries, and the arms embargo will inevitably be cancelled. The House of Representatives is scheduled to submit it for a vote tomorrow. Democratic members of the Foreign Affairs Committee will hold a meeting before the House of Representatives convenes to decide on their stance. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>US Lowers Silver Prices, Aiming to Suppress Japan; London Observers View it as Such, US Says it is to Prevent Dumping</h3>
<p>(London) After the US Treasury Department repeatedly lowered the price it sets for purchasing foreign silver, the price of silver here fell another three-quarters of a penny per ounce. It is not yet known whether the US Treasury Department will continue to lower silver prices tonight. Generally, people in the market here are eagerly awaiting the arrival of news. According to the observation of certain figures in the financial community, the price of silver will not fall below eighteen pence per ounce, and it is believed that the fall in silver prices is enough to constitute a powerful weapon against Japan. The US authorities may use it to induce Japan to adopt a more moderate attitude. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After the Treasury Department reduced the purchase price of foreign silver yesterday from 43 cents per ounce to 40 cents, it was reduced again today to 38.5 cents. In two days, it has been lowered by two jiaos. Senior officials of the Treasury Department refused to explain the reason for the devaluation, but responsible parties claimed that this move was purely to prevent foreign silver from being massively dumped on the American market before Congress decides on silver policy. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) The disagreement between the US government and the opposition in Congress regarding silver policy has greatly affected the London silver market. The price of silver has fallen by three-quarters of a penny per ounce. Relevant parties are now waiting quietly for developments and say that how the situation develops in the future will depend on the attitude of the US authorities. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>US Monetary Law: Joint Discussion by the Senate and House of Representatives</h3>
<p>(Washington) The US Treasury Department has again lowered its purchase price for foreign silver in New York from 40 cents per ounce to 38.5 cents. The official price of silver bars at Handy &amp; Harman in New York has also been reduced from 39.75 cents per ounce to 38.25 cents. (Reuter, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) When the House of Representatives met today, the scene in the chamber was extremely heated. Republican Congressman Fish expressed opposition to the President's power to purchase foreign silver and change the fineness of the dollar, but Democratic Congressman Somers (Chairman of the House Committee on Coinage, Weights, and Measures) vigorously refuted it, stating that the President should be allowed to maintain the right to purchase silver from China and Mexico so that American commerce in China could be expected to develop. Taking Mexico as an example, the country's currency price fell by 10% yesterday due to the Senate's vote, and the impact of this can be seen. As a result of the discussion, a resolution was finally passed by a majority of 209 to 161 votes, by which the House of Representatives appointed five representatives to form a joint committee with representatives of the Senate to draft a compromise plan.

<h3>Soviet Chargé d'Affaires in Japan Recalled to Country</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the recall of Soviet Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Smetanin, it has been verified today by the Information Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is said that Mr. Smetanin has not returned to the Soviet Union for two years, so he has made a special trip home to visit old friends. However, neutral observers believe that Mr. Smetanin's trip must be related to the border dispute between Mongolia and "Manchukuo." In other words, it is to report to Molotov and at the same time to seek instructions and conduct negotiations with the Tokyo side. (Associated Press, 29th)</p>

<h3>The Soviet Window to the West (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Te Ye</p>
<p>These data have not yet been fully verified because the strength and organization of the Soviet fleet in the Arctic Ocean can be quickly enhanced by medium-sized warships sailing from Kronstadt (still the largest naval base in the Soviet Union) through the canal connecting the Baltic Sea and the White Sea. However, this canal is only navigable in summer.</p>
<p>Why does the Soviet Union pay so much attention to the military development of the Murmansk region? This question cannot be answered purely in terms of defense because defending the area does not require such a strong force. Then, is she doing this for offensive purposes? This raises the question of who she is preparing to attack. Finland and Norway have both witnessed these great military preparations, and neither country has any intention of attacking the Soviet Union. Then, will the Soviet Union seize Finnish and Norwegian territory on the Arctic Ocean coast? Many events have shown that the Soviet Union does have this tendency. For example, mysterious Soviet planes often fly over the northern border of Finland. If Soviet aviators are not spying on the land from the sky and using cameras to photograph the terrain, why bother with this trouble?</p>
<p>We must remember that the Soviet Union's access to the Arctic Ocean is limited to a 50-mile stretch of land, and even there, the climate is volatile, with fog or rain, and it is too far from the open sea. Finland's coast, on the other hand, has countless deep-sea bays that are natural ice-free harbors all year round, from which access to the sea is much safer than starting from the Murmansk coast. Another factor is the Norwegian port of Narvik, which in 1938 had 8 million tons of the world's best ore (all from Swedish Lapland) that were transported to various parts of the world. These ores are the most important supplies in Europe and have become even more important recently due to the competition among countries for military equipment. In the event of war, if the Soviet Union can control the export of this material or use air raids to stop mining, the countries involved will feel unhappy. Norway and Finland are now increasingly uneasy. Norway's national defense was originally very weak. Seeing the Soviet Union's military preparations in the Arctic Ocean expanding day by day, Norwegian experts are increasingly worried that Norway's defense is inadequate.</p>
<p>Finland is greatly hindered in the Arctic Ocean area under the terms of its peace treaty with Russia. Since 1920, she has bordered the Arctic Ocean through the Petsamo Corridor. She can only dock a few patrol boats in the Petsamo Bay, but is still not allowed to build any defensive works or aircraft bases. Unarmed Soviet planes can fly over the area. In peacetime, Finnish Lapland does not station regular troops, only a small number of border guards and a local defense force composed of volunteers. In fact, no air defense equipment has been made. However, because the Petsamo mines have rich nickel production and local industry is also developing rapidly, the value of the area is increasing, so it is expected that considerable military equipment will be deployed soon. However, the Red Army is powerful, especially due to the recent development of amazing techniques by parachute troops, and the sky is even more difficult to defend. Even if considerable military defense is deployed, it may not have much effect. From these facts, we can determine that</p>
<p>the Arctic Ocean coast is extremely vulnerable to Soviet attack. Recently, the Nordic countries proposed the establishment of an "armed neutrality group," which has been under discussion for a long time and may still be able to use the existing defense forces to guarantee the security of Northern Europe to a certain extent. This defense alliance gives countries concerned about the integrity of Northern Europe a sense of security, and Germany is one of them. (End)</p>
<h3>Central Important Political News Compilation: Commemorating Fallen Soldiers on the Double Seventh Festival; Four Banks Establish Branches in the Northwest</h3>
<p>Tax Reduction on Steel Imports</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: The Ministry of Finance, to facilitate industrial construction in the rear, has telegraphed customs offices in all provinces, permitting a two-thirds reduction in import taxes for steel, hardware, and machinery. It stipulates that when steel and other metal products and machinery are declared for import, they shall generally be allowed to pay two-thirds less than the current tax rate. For imports of machinery and metals, a detailed list of items, quantities, values, place of origin, and purchaser (factory, mine, or importer), along with the customs office and destination, must be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for review. The Ministry of Economic Affairs will then forward the list to the Ministry of Finance, which will instruct the customs office to reduce the tax. Before obtaining approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to forward to the Ministry of Finance, importers may apply to the customs office to pay a deposit based on the current tax rate for immediate release. However, the deposit period shall not exceed three months. After this period, the customs office will deposit the tax and no refunds will be given. This measure is now in effect and will be valid for six months. (Lists of metal and machinery items are available in two categories, A and B, details omitted.)</p>
<p>Double Seventh Anti-Japanese Construction Commemoration</p>
<p>With the approval of the Military Affairs Commission, the National Government has ordered the Executive Yuan to issue a circular to the entire country (including occupied areas), designating July 7th (Double Seventh Festival) as the Anti-Japanese War and National Construction Memorial Day. On this day, tributes will be paid to all soldiers and civilian victims. Public memorial sites will be established in all provinces, cities, counties, and towns nationwide, and provisions will be made for "the spiritual tablets of nameless heroes and civilian victims who died for the Anti-Japanese War and National Construction."

Apart from those participating in the ceremony, all citizens, whether indoors or outdoors, must stand solemnly, remove their hats, and bow their heads in silent remembrance for five minutes. Subsequently, pedestrians passing by the foundations of the memorials and cemeteries must remove their hats to pay respects. All provinces, cities, counties, and towns nationwide will also be ordered to mobilize the entire population on this day to express condolences to the families of fallen soldiers and soldiers on active duty, and to offer comfort to wounded soldiers.</p>

The Northwest Health Commissioner's Office will be responsible for handling health affairs in Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Suiyuan, and Henan provinces. Long Yuying, the original Health Department technician and chief of the Health Care Division, has been appointed as the commissioner. The annual funding is set at 240,000 yuan, and the initial operating expenses are 174,000 yuan. It is approved that on June 15, he will lead more than 100 technical personnel to organize and establish the office. The Xikang Health Institute will be responsible for handling health affairs in the entire province of Xikang. Weng Zhilong, the former president of Tongji University, has been appointed as the director. He is scheduled to depart for Xikang soon to arrange everything. (June 14)</p>
<h3>Taicang Guerrilla Squad Kills Puppet Deputy Commander; Wang Shilan's Troops Capture Xintang Market; Fifteen-Year-Old Bravely Kills a Notorious Traitor</h3>
<p>Taicang Correspondence: Since the fall of Taicang, the guerrilla squads scattered in the surrounding villages have been very active under the leadership of Wang Shilan. Last winter, they fought more than ten battles. Wang's younger brother, Shikui, died for his country. Wang, remembering the national hatred and the hatred for his brother, became even more resentful. He hired guerrilla military and political specialists to assist in training the troops, thus strengthening his forces. Last year in October, the Jiangsu Provincial Government appointed Wang as the commander of the Second Administrative District Security Regiment, ordering him to station his troops in Taicang and Kunshan. In recent months, Hong Jinping, the puppet Taicang County Magistrate, and Geng Chao, the puppet Deputy Commander of the Security Regiment, have committed many evils, imposing exorbitant taxes, extorting the people, kidnapping and falsely accusing, using every means possible. The people, unable to bear the oppression, pleaded with Wang to swiftly eliminate them. Wang then authorized Tang Namin and Qiu Yangshan to plan the elimination of Hong and Geng. Tang, upon receiving the order, immediately trained a suicide squad to enter the puppet Security Regiment headquarters in Xintang Market, waiting for an opportunity to act. At the same time, he mobilized troops, launching the attack at 11:00 AM on the 24th of this month. First, Mao Jingao, a member of the suicide squad, sneaked into the puppet headquarters and reported to Geng that the New Fourth Army troops had entered the territory. As Geng Chao was about to stand up, Mao immediately drew his pistol and fired six shots at Geng, killing him instantly. Another member of the suicide squad, Shen Fu, stood at the staircase entrance. Upon hearing the gunshots, he opened fire on the Japanese and puppet soldiers, killing five more. Shen Fu, wounded by three bullets, rushed out, leading other team members into the melee. At the same time, Tang led soldiers from the Third Battalion to provide support, surrounding the Japanese and puppet troops. Seeing that Geng had been eliminated, the Japanese and puppet soldiers scattered in panic. Simultaneously, there were no troops that could be mobilized within Taicang City. By 4:00 PM, the Japanese and puppet troops were completely wiped out by the Chinese Fourth Regiment, with 52 Japanese and puppet soldiers killed, more than 100 wounded, and 120 captured alive. The people cheered. The suicide squad consisted of only 74 people. Mao Jingao, who killed Geng Chao, was only 15 years old. Geng was originally a guerrilla commander under Xiong Jiandong, but recently defected. People who heard of his death expressed their joy. Commander Wang, seeing that the operation was very effective, instructed Tang and Qiu to intensify troop training and organize the people, striving for military-civilian cooperation. At the same time, he joined forces with the Jiangnan Advance Army, planning to attack the county seat in separate groups on a set date. Currently, the Advance Army has 3,200 people entering Taicang territory, and has made contact with Wang's troops.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department Proceeds with Reinforcing and Repairing Canal Dikes After Consulting with the Canal Works Bureau to Determine Measures</h3>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence: Han Deqin, Chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, recently, due to the unrepaired breach of the Yellow River in Henan, instructed that the project of reinforcing and repairing canal dikes should be started early before this year's flood season, in order to reduce flood damage and avoid major disasters. However, due to the large project and insufficient funds, he had previously telegraphed the Central Ministry of Economic Affairs to allocate funds for the project. It is now learned that before the funds are remitted, the situation is urgent and cannot be delayed for long. He specially instructed Xu Mojia, Chief Secretary of the Construction Department, to telegraph Shen, the Director of the Canal Works Bureau, the day before yesterday, to come to the province immediately to discuss the implementation measures in person, in order to start construction. Director Shen, after receiving the telegram, was delayed by important matters in Hai'an and could not come in person. He appointed Wang Zizun, the Section Chief of the Bureau, Wang Yuanyi, the Technician, Xue Zhankui, the Inspector, and Yuan Guiguan, the Technician, to go to the provincial capital for consultation. After the matter is completed, Shen will still come to the province to request instructions in person. It is reported that the officials appointed by the Canal Works Bureau held a meeting with Secretary Xu in the Construction Department on the 18th of this month, and discussed and decided on various measures for reinforcing and repairing the east and west dikes of the canal and preparing for flood prevention. The decision is as follows: (1) How to handle the reinforcement and repair of the east and west dikes of the canal? It was decided that if the Ministry of Economic Affairs replies and allocates funds before the end of June, it will be handled according to the survey plan of the Canal Works Bureau. If there is still no reply, the dangerous sections will be selected, reinforced and heightened separately, and workers will be recruited to build a sub-dike with a top width of 1.2 meters, to be prepared and implemented by the Canal Works Bureau. (2) Missing planks in the various sluice gates along the canal should be urgently replaced. It was decided that the Canal Works Bureau should order the Huaipi and Jiangbao sections to complete the work within a limited time. (3) Water level records in Jiangba and Yangzhuang and other places should be restored and reported daily. It was decided to be handled by the Canal Works Bureau. (4) The Huai-Pi and Jiang stations should be strictly ordered to fully open all culverts and sluice gates along the canal, in order to discharge the water of Shengkong Lake and provide irrigation for farmland. It was decided to be handled and reported by the Canal Works Bureau. (5) How should the five ports of Guihu be dredged? It was decided that the Department and Bureau should each send a person to conduct an on-site inspection and prepare a concise plan. (6) It is proposed to appropriately narrow the entrances of the Jia and Chen ports on the west dike of the canal. It was decided that the Canal Works Bureau should prepare a plan and submit it to the province for approval and implementation in advance. (7) The spring repair project of the canal was decided to be re-estimated by the province and the most urgent work should be carried out first. (8) Accumulation of soil and materials on the canal dikes. It was decided that the Canal Works Bureau should submit a request to the province, asking the relevant counties to recruit workers to accumulate soil separately and report for commissioning. Regarding the accumulation of materials, the provincial government ordered Yancheng and Baoying counties to investigate the current quantity of firewood stored and report to the province for future reference.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Attack Sijing Town; Chinese Army Zhou Fuquan Killed in Action; Japanese and Puppet Troops Leave Over Sixty Corpses Behind</h3>

<h3>The Coastal Defenses of Zhejiang and Fujian are Strong; The Gap in Zhenhai Has Been Blocked; A German Ship Arriving in Ningbo Parks Outside the Blockade Line; Three British Ships Unload Cargo at Chuanshi in Minjiang River</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Dinghai and the tension in Ningbo, the Ningbo Defense Command has prohibited foreign ships from sailing in order to strengthen coastal defenses. The Sino-Italian Shipping Company has received a telegram from Ningbo stating that the gap in the blockade line at Zhenhai has been ordered to be blocked the night before. The German Rehe Shipping Company's ship "Mofu" sailed to Ningbo yesterday morning. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, it arrived outside Zhenhai Port but was unable to enter. Japanese warships are gathered outside the mouth of the Oujiang River, and the situation is tense. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Gap in Zhenhai Is Blocked</p>
<p>The Sino-Italian Shipping Company in this city received a telegram from its Ningbo branch the day before yesterday, stating, "Top secret, Ningbo Airlines was notified by the Defense Department that the opening for navigation in the Zhenhai blockade line is to be blocked immediately to strengthen coastal defenses. Please inform all shipping companies to take notice." Yesterday afternoon, a follow-up telegram stated that the "Old Taiping" ship had sunk at 9:00 PM on the 28th, and the gap had been completely blocked. Furthermore, the Ningbo Hometown Association also received a telegram from Ningbo yesterday morning, confirming the blockade. This shows that the situation in Zhejiang is tense, and the authorities have taken this emergency measure. However, it is understood that the situation in Ningbo is still calm and stable, and the people are quite calm.</p>
<p>"Mofu" Arrives in Ningbo but Cannot Enter</p>
<p>The German Rehe Shipping Company's ship "Mofu," having been specially approved by the Ningbo authorities, continued to sail to Ningbo. The ship set sail from Shanghai at 4:00 AM yesterday morning. At 4:00 PM that afternoon, the company received a telegram from Captain Berge stating that the ship had arrived and anchored outside Zhenhai Port. However, it did not mention whether the gap had been blocked. The company then telegraphed to inquire about the situation, but had not received a reply by the time of publication. Therefore, the whereabouts of the ship will be clarified after receiving a telegram today.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Attack Chinese Troops Unsuccessfully</p>
<p>According to a passenger who recently arrived in Shanghai from Wenzhou on the German "Hana" ship, when the "Hana" ship sailed from Wenzhou to Shanghai on the morning of the 27th, as it passed Huanghua Customs, the military police inspection station at the customs, as usual, sent troops on a speedboat to board the ship for inspection. Unexpectedly, as the Chinese military police were about to board the ship, they were suddenly discovered by the Japanese navy. Immediately, a Japanese aircraft circled above the ship, strafing it with machine guns and throwing small hand grenades. At that time, the Huanghua Customs Fortress immediately fired heavy anti-aircraft guns. The Japanese aircraft did not dare to fly low, and the Chinese troops were able to safely retreat without any casualties. Fortunately, the ship was not affected. The ship did not undergo inspection and sailed directly to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Gather Outside the Mouth of the Oujiang River</p>
<p>Three Japanese warships are anchored outside the mouth of the Oujiang River, along with one aircraft carrier, which is carrying many Japanese aircraft. In addition, there are six transport ships converted from merchant ships. The Japanese soldiers on the ships are very busy. Furthermore, when the ship sailed to a certain sea area, another Japanese warship sailed towards Wenzhou, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers. It is assumed that they have some plan for Wenzhou. It is also learned that the Italian Sino-Italian Shipping Company's "Kangshayi" ship, which departed from Wenzhou for the last time on the morning of the 28th, will also arrive in Shanghai today.</p>
<p>British Ships at Chuanshi Report Situation: A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the British Jardine Matheson Shipping Company yesterday that the company's "Shenguang," "Shenfu," and "Shenai" ships are all anchored at Chuanshi Island outside the blockade line of Mawei in the Minjiang River, Fuzhou, and are unloading cargo. "Shenai" will sail from Chuanshi to Sandu'ao today. On the evening of the day before yesterday at 5:00 PM, a telegram was received from the ships at Chuanshi, reporting on the unloading situation, and stating that three Japanese warships are anchored in the waters of Chuanshi, and the situation is tense, but the local area is peaceful. Furthermore, the British Swire Shipping Company's "New Beijing" ship, which sails on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo the day before yesterday, and is scheduled to load cargo and sail directly to Quanzhou, Fujian on July 1st (Saturday).</p>
<p>Mawei's Blockade Has Strong Booms</p>
<p>Japanese troops landed at Jianfeng in Fuzhou Port, and are still entrenched there. It is confirmed by the shipping industry that six Japanese aircraft bombed Mawei and Changmen on the morning of the 28th, with unspecified losses. Currently, Mawei Port has been closed to all ships since the 28th, but the gap in the blockade line has not been completely blocked. The Mawei blockade line has strong booms, and it is difficult to destroy them. The Chinese military authorities have deployed heavy troops in Changmen, Guantou, and the Luoxing Pagoda area. If the Japanese troops attempt to land in Fuzhou, they will face strong resistance.</p>
<p>Ships Gather in the Huangpu River</p>
<p>After the war, shipping between Shanghai and Fujian is entirely maintained by foreign shipping companies. The ports of call include Ningbo, Wenzhou, Dinghai, Haimen in Zhejiang Province, and Fuzhou, Xinghua Quanzhou in Fujian Province. With the exception of Haimen, Quanzhou, and Xinghua, which were previously banned from sailing, Wenzhou and Fuzhou have also been notified by the Japanese naval authorities that third-country ships are prohibited from sailing to the ports of Min and Ou, affecting the suspension of flights. All ships of various foreign shipping companies are currently unable to operate any lines, and are mostly anchored in Shanghai. Therefore, more than 20 ships are gathered near the Roosevelt Wharf in the Huangpu River.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Bombard Fuzhou and Wenzhou: According to telegrams received by the shipping industry yesterday afternoon, (1) Five Japanese warships arrived at the mouth of the Oujiang River in Wenzhou on the morning of the 29th and fired more than 20 shells at the shore. The local defense forces also returned fire. (2) Six Japanese warships sailed to Changmen at the mouth of the Minjiang River yesterday and anchored there, firing shells at the shore and launching several speedboats filled with Japanese troops, attempting to land. They were met with a head-on attack by the Chinese army and failed to succeed.</p>
<p>Reports of Some Foreigners Evacuating</p>
<p>The Japanese have announced that they will take military action against Fuzhou in Fujian Province and Wenzhou in Zhejiang Province, and have notified the consular corps through the Japanese consulate, requesting third-country ships and foreigners to leave the two places before noon on the 29th to avoid danger. Yesterday was the deadline. According to a reporter from the New News Agency, British citizens in Fuzhou and Wenzhou began to evacuate yesterday, but there was no news about American citizens. To avoid danger, various foreign shipping companies have suspended sailing on the Fuzhou and Wenzhou lines.</p>

It is considered that this suggestion involves the entire monetary system, and it is inconvenient to make a claim lightly, and how to ensure that the turnover of funds of industrial and commercial enterprises is not short of funds should be coordinated. It immediately formulated relief opinions with the Silver and Money Industries Association and telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance, and the Banking Association sent the agreed-upon Silver and Money Industry Adjustment Interbank Remittance Measures, Interbank Remittance Requisition Measures, and the Interbank Remittance Preparation Inspection Committee Rules for review. The full text of the said measures and rules has been reported in the newspaper and will not be repeated here.

<h3>In the Case of Ding Geller's Tragic Murder, Britain Urges Japan to Reply Quickly; Instructions Have Been Issued to the Ambassador to Japan to Handle the Retaliation Plan Proposed by British Members of Parliament</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 28th: British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler stated in the House of Commons today that the government has issued an urgent instruction to its ambassador to Japan, Craigie, urging the Japanese government to reply quickly to the British protest regarding the murder of Ding Geller, an employee of the Lun Chang Company in Shanghai. The Labor Party member of parliament, Noel-Baker, asked whether the government would consider effective methods to stop Japanese trade within the United Kingdom. Butler replied that it would be better to wait for the reply to the Ding Geller case, and that all the facts about this tragic case have now been notified to the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Labor Party Members Raise Questions</p>
<p>Havas, London, 28th: At a meeting of the House of Commons today, Beck, a Labor Party member of parliament in the opposition, asked, "Regarding the murder of Ding Geller, a British employee of the British-owned Lun Chang Yarn Factory in Shanghai, the government previously lodged a protest. Has it received a reply from the Japanese government?"</p>
<p>Britain Urges Japan to Reply Strictly</p>
<p>Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied immediately, "Not yet, but the government has continued to order Sir Craigie, the ambassador to Japan, to urge the government to reply as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Whether to Take Retaliatory Measures</p>
<p>Beck also asked whether the Japanese side is currently pursuing a movement that attempts to destroy our country's forces and commerce in the Far East, and the Ding Geller case is only one aspect of it.

<h3>Joint Meeting of Rice Industry Revises Market Regulations; The Principle is to Make Sure That Merchants and Customers Comply; Rice Prices Continue to Fall Back, Sales Turn Tired; It is Widely Believed That the Bureau Will Lower Rice Prices Again</h3>
<p>The Bean and Rice Market Management Committee, in view of the fact that the market firms and customers disregard market regulations, conduct private transactions, resulting in a chaotic market order and unstable prices, which has a major impact on the people's food, and disputes often arise between merchants and customers, the Management Committee, in order to reorganize and revise the regulations, held a</p>
<p>Joint Meeting of Merchants and Customers</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM yesterday, at the Changre Shanjing Map on Sima Road. Fu Qian'geng was publicly elected as the temporary chairman. First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, and then began to discuss and revise the market regulations, so that all 105 firms and customers could comply as a principle, and at the same time, discussed the market's</p>
<p>Business Policy</p>
<p>In order to make the transactions of all firms more regular, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired from the rice market yesterday. After the market opened at 9:00 AM yesterday morning, because hoarders sold off one after another, and 6,000 to 7,000 bags of rice, 3,000 to 4,000 bags of rice were transported to Shanghai by vehicles. The Municipal Council sends personnel to the market every day to supervise the prices of transactions of various goods in the market.</p>
<p>Once Discovered</p>
<p>If someone raises the market price, the accurate name and firm will be copied and sent to the bureau for punishment in accordance with the regulations, and the price limit will be strictly enforced, so that the rice price will not rise and hinder the security of the concession. In addition, 3,000 tons of Saigon rice have been traded, so the entire food supply of Shanghai</p>
<p>Can Definitely Be Worry-Free</p>
<p>The bottom storage may increase daily. According to a reporter from the New News Agency, although Shanghai is now following price-limited transactions, it will soon fall, and its</p>
<p>There Are Six Reasons</p>
<p>The stocks of various stacks in Shanghai and the stocks of citizens can be maintained for at least three months or more, Although the place of origin prohibits incidents of leaving the country, but according to its regulations, taxes are still released, so the number of guests coming by land and water averages at least four to five thousand shi per day, it is hoped that the autumn harvest will be promising in various places, the new rice will be on the market in more than two months, Foreign rice orders are completed, and they will be shipped in succession in the middle of next month. It is widely believed that the Municipal Council has</p>

<p>Rice prices, general hoarders, are taking the opportunity to sell off, and the market will show a phenomenon of oversupply. Therefore, based on the above reasons, rice prices will inevitably fall, and there is no possibility of rising, it is said.</p>

<p>Butler replied, "As far as this case is concerned, I think it is better to wait for the Japanese reply. After the government telegraphed Ambassador Craigie to urge him, the reply may be sent out immediately, which is not necessarily impossible.</p>
<h3>Landing Attempt Foiled, Japanese Planes Bomb Beisha: Over Ten Bombs on Xingang, Lingdian, Beitou, Over Ten Civilians Killed and Wounded in New Bombings</h3>
<p>The coastal ports along the Beisha shipping route have continued to be bombarded by Japanese warships in recent days. Three Japanese planes again flew to the area on the previous day to drop bombs, bombing portside civilian houses, resulting in over ten civilian casualties. Our Dagang News Agency reporter has investigated and reported the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Xingang, Lingdian</p>
<p>Japanese warships (No. 32) and armed motorboats continued to shell the shore at various ports yesterday, but their landing attempt has not yet succeeded. In frustration and to vent their anger, the Japanese army dispatched three planes which took off from Chongming Airport at 10:00 AM on the previous day (the 27th) to drop over ten bombs on Xingang Town and Lingdian Town, indiscriminately bombing. The town's civilian houses caught fire and burned, with thick smoke filling the air.</p>
<p>Civilian Houses Destroyed, Over Ten Killed and Wounded</p>
<p>Xingang Town and Lingdian Town are only about half a mile from the port. The Japanese army suspected that Chinese troops were hiding in the civilian houses in the towns, using them as cover, making it difficult to find targets. Therefore, they dispatched three planes to bomb them, while the Japanese warships shelled Sanhe Port and Wanjia Port, coordinating with the air raid. In this attack, over ten civilians were killed and wounded, mostly the elderly, weak, women, and children. According to the Dagang News Agency reporter's inquiries with people coming from Beisha, residents of Xingang Town had been evacuated in advance, and only two children, surnamed Jiang and others, were killed. The casualties were heavier in Lingdian Town. Two bombs landed in the West Market, destroying the Yuanshengtai Dyeing Shop, killing three villagers, including one surnamed Liu. Three bombs landed in the Hedong area of the Central Market, destroying the Su Qialong General Goods Store, killing the elderly couple Gu Qijin and his wife, and their two young grandchildren. Two bombs landed in the North Market, destroying the Wanchengchang Store, killing four people, including one surnamed Fang. The remaining bombs all landed in the fields. The Japanese planes brutally murdered innocent people, and their cruel actions are evident.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchant Ships Plan to Change to Night Shifts</p>
<p>Although the Beisha battles are ongoing, foreign vessels continue to operate as usual to maintain traffic between Shanghai and Beisha. The Yiyi and Helun of British firm Jardine Matheson departed yesterday morning, and the Haiyilun of German firm Far East and the Jiangdinglun of Fuhua arrived and berthed at the Bund wharf at 4:30 PM yesterday. Since the final destination of the ships is Qinglong Port, designated by the Japanese army, there are few passengers and goods. To maintain operations, they held a special meeting last night to discuss changing to night shifts, traveling back and forth on the same day, in order to reduce costs.</p>
<h3>Three Democratic Nations Celebrate July Festivals: Citizens of China, America and France All Fly Flags on July 1st, 4th and 14th to Commemorate</h3>
<p>July 1st is the anniversary of the establishment of the National Government of the Republic of China, July 4th is the Independence Day of the United States, and July 14th is the Democratic Day of France. These valuable anniversaries of the three major democratic countries all fall within the first half of July, which can be said to be a naturally wonderful symbol. Therefore, the Chinese citizens of this city and the expatriates of the United States and France will all fly their national flags for one day each on the respective anniversaries to commemorate.</p>
<p>Travelers Detour, Disturbances Along the Way</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the ships arrived, people from Haiqi Township in Shanghai went to the wharf to inquire about the news of their hometown being bombed. According to the Dagang News Agency reporter's inquiry with a gentleman who took a ship to Shanghai from Lusi after venturing to detour through Qinglong Port, since the ships were prevented from stopping at Wan, Xingang, Lingdian Port, and Sanhe Port, travelers in Yudong, Baochang, Liujia, Lusi, Sanyang, Jiulong, and other places have found it very difficult to travel. On the way, they have to pass through the Japanese military警戒area, and are subject to searches and interrogations by Japanese and puppet military police, and all kinds of difficulties, so they dare not try to take the risk. Most of the travelers are locals. Yesterday, very few detoured through the above-mentioned ports to Shanghai. The sound of cannons rumbled along the way, indicating there was a war, but the people in the countryside were still stable.</p>
<h3>Moved by the Warmth for Refugees, the French Ambassador's Wife Shed Tears: Visited the International First Refugee Camp Yesterday and Was Deeply Satisfied with All Kinds of Work</h3>
<p>Madame Cosme, wife of the French Ambassador to China, heard that the International First Refugee Camp on Route Massenet was well-managed, and especially praised the education, production, sanitation work. Therefore, at 10:00 AM yesterday, accompanied by Madame Yudan, Madame Gongsang, and others, she took the embassy car to visit the camp. At that time, flags were hung high at the gate of the camp, fluttering in the wind.</p>
<p>Along Both Sides of the Avenue Inside the Camp</p>
<p>Five hundred male and female refugee children lined up in a singing honor guard. When the Ambassador's wife and others arrived at the camp, they were led in by Camp Director Pan Da, Father Mumu, and all the faculty and staff of the camp. Five hundred children stood at attention and saluted in unison. Under the direction of Zheng Yaonan, a nine-year-old child, they sang Chinese and French songs and other majestic songs. The Madam was very moved and inspected them one by one, touching them and shaking hands with the refugees to express sympathy.</p>
<p>Even Shed Tears</p>
<p>Afterwards, she visited the labor exhibition of refugee children in the junior high school class and the radio telecommunications training class. She expressed surprise and sympathy for the refugee children who were in a pitiful situation, living in hardship, but still able to immerse themselves in their studies and achieve remarkable results. Later, she received a formal welcome in the French classroom of the junior high school from over a thousand refugees, primary and secondary school students, and faculty and staff of the camp. Refugee Bao Junzhang delivered a welcome speech, and the Madam was deeply moved and expressed her sympathy in a thank-you speech. Afterwards, she visited the "Refugee Daycare Center Participating in Production," the hospital, the sock factory, the egg-knocking factory, and the ice-carrying work, tirelessly seeking out the group. Every old and weak patient was</p>
<p>Personally Comforted</p>
<p>The Madam toured the entire camp, and everywhere she went, she only heard the refugee children singing welcome songs and welcome sounds. The entire atmosphere fully demonstrated the increase in the close cooperation between China and France, and their peoples. Before leaving, she wished all the refugees in the camp good health, and expressed her satisfaction with the efforts of the French expatriates in serving the Chinese refugees.</p>

<h3>Suspension of Principal and Interest Payments on the Telecommunications Government Bonds: Lottery Will Still Be Held as Scheduled and Will Not Affect Credit</h3>
<p>The fifteenth principal redemption lottery for the 24th Year of the Republic of China Telecommunications Government Bonds was held in Shanghai on June 10 by the National Debt Fund Management Committee. Three branches were drawn, with a total redemption of 300,000 yuan in national currency. According to the regulations and the principal and interest payment schedule, payments will begin today by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the National Industrial Bank in various locations. However, according to the New Life News Agency reporter's inquiry with the banking community yesterday, this telecommunications government bond is issued by the Ministry of Transportation. It is said that the principal and interest payments have been temporarily suspended since September of last year. Moreover, this government bond is not circulated in the market, so the suspension of principal and interest payments will not affect the overall debt repayment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Municipal Bank Accepts Demand Deposits</h3>

<h3>A Contradictory Phenomenon: Restrictions on the Repatriation of Japanese Yen: Limited to 200 Yuan Per Person Per Trip, Japanese Regulations, So-Called "New Regulations"</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening Post" reports that, regarding the exchange of Japanese yen between Shanghai and Japan, the Japanese side has decided to implement new regulations starting from July 1st. The Tokyo Ministry of Finance has recently revised the articles of the Japanese Foreign Exchange Control Law to restrict the Japanese yen exported from Japan to Shanghai, and at the same time reduce the Japanese yen returning from Shanghai to Japan. According to the new regulations, the remittance and travel expenses, etc., allowed for each Japanese leaving the country will be reduced from 1,000 Japanese yen to only 500 Japanese yen, including currency, drafts and credit letters. Japanese tourists carrying larger amounts of money out of the country must obtain special permission from the Bank of Japan. The Japanese yen returning from overseas, which was not previously subject to any legal restrictions, will be limited to only 200 yuan per person per trip. If the Japanese yen carried back to Japan exceeds this amount, it will all be confiscated.</p>
<h3>Japan's Domestic Economy Has Reached a Desperate Stage: Naginata Blades and Pen Nibs Are Melted Down to Make Munitions, Tokyo Has an Atmosphere of Unease</h3>
<p>According to the records disclosed by the U.S. Department of State, Japan did not purchase war materiel from the U.S. in April.</p>
<p>What is referred to here is actual armaments. There is no doubt that many of the items purchased by Japan from the United States are indirectly used for war. The Ministry of Finance has recently issued the following order, requiring that all gold-made items listed below must be reported to the Ministry of Finance by July 5, including: rings, jewelry, and other personal ornaments, watch cases, eyeglass rims, and other personal items, cigarette holders, cigarette cases, cups, pots, and other</p>
<p>Food and Drink Utensils</p>
<p>Candles, incense burners, paperweights, pencil sharpeners, paper knives, seals, and other household items, Japanese authorities have asked the Jewelry Association to refrain from using gold to make any items, and have asked stores not to display any gold items. From this, it can be inferred that the Japanese government is now directly entering people's homes to search for this valuable yellow metal for the purpose of purchasing materials to support its troops in fighting in China. At the same time,</p>
<p>Official Announcement</p>
<p>A rationing system will soon be implemented. This system will apply to butter, milk, eggs, tea, sugar, and other videos. According to Japanese newspapers, the government has decided on this measure, "Even if the people's living standards will be temporarily lowered as a result, it will not care." Japan intends to sell these goods overseas, at least to make up for its overall outflow of foreign currency. The Every</p>
<p>Foreign Currency</p>
<p>obtained will continue to be used for war. This is the scene Japan presents in the world market. Economists say that Japan is clearly trying its best to obtain foreign currency to purchase necessities to supply its troops' consumption. The Japanese government arbitrarily stabilizes prices, but costs have risen sharply, so that the sale of goods is not profitable. Currently, many of Japan's products require "handling fees" or "service fees" of several yuan. Retailers</p>
<p>Therefore Fail</p>
<p>are commonplace. Therefore, the interest rate on loans has been reduced from 5.7% to 4.8%. Bankrupt merchants and employees who have lost tens of thousands of dollars have changed to other industries. The circulation of money is accelerating, and there is a shortage of goods, with supply falling short of demand. Although this may not be inflation, economists say that deflation is not far away. Although this kind of domestic situation seems serious, it is still not as serious as the</p>
<p>Serious Issue</p>
<p>of using funds to maintain the war. The problem of using funds to maintain peace is also particularly complicated. Six months ago, Japanese financial leaders were very confident that the economic strength of the Japanese people could maintain both war and peace. Today, Tokyo has shown a strong atmosphere of suspicion, hesitation, and uneasiness. Although the government and the public have not yet openly expressed pessimism, their strong optimism must have dissipated. Since the outbreak of the war, Chinese leaders have insisted that the Chinese dragon will continue the long-term resistance, which will cause Japan to</p>
<p>Economic Collapse</p>
<p>Today, neutral observers, while still not doubting that the ultimate result will be defeat, are now acknowledging that the war has reached a stalemate, and that Japan's finances are burdened with the heavy expense of maintaining a large army on the mainland indefinitely. This is no different from the collapse of economic institutions. There are rumors in Tokyo that Japan is currently "taking measures" against China, and will present some compromises in person, etc., because everyone knows that Japan's financial situation is now very serious, and it has to do this.

<h3>Salary Increase for Employees of the French Municipal Council: Officially Announced Within Days; In addition to the salary increase, a subsidy will be added, depending on the family burden of the employees</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times said: "It was learned yesterday (the 28th) that the French Concession Municipal Council will officially announce an increase in employees' salaries within a day or two. The recommendations of the committee that investigated living conditions and revised salaries have been approved. Details of the salary increase will be published in the next issue of the Municipal Council Gazette. According to reliable sources, the salaries of the employees of the Municipal Council will be greatly increased according to the level of basic salaries and nationality. Thus, the French, Chinese, Russian, and Vietnamese employees will be compensated for the losses they have suffered due to the current high cost of living and the low value of the French currency."</p>
<p>Salary Increase Standards for Employees Residing in Shanghai</p>
<p>The special subsidies given to employees by the Municipal Council on July 4, 1938, ranging from 7% to 22%, have all been abolished. It is now proposed to increase the employees residing in Shanghai by 13% to 15% based on their basic salaries before July 4, 1938, to replace the subsidy. If the exchange rate remains between 5.5 pence and 7.125 pence, these subsidies will be implemented for a long time.</p>
<p>Low-Salary Employees Are Particularly Favored</p>
<p>Employees with salaries below 700 yuan receive the most benefits, with a 15% increase in basic salaries. Those with monthly salaries above 700 yuan receive a maximum increase of 13%. This is the salary increase for married people, and the salary increase for single men is 11% less.</p>
<p>Additional Subsidies for Chinese and French Employees</p>
<p>In addition, the child subsidy for married French personnel of the Municipal Council will also be increased. The monthly allowance of 14 yuan for children under 18 will be increased to 40 yuan. The housing subsidy for married personnel will also be increased. In addition to the percentage increase, Chinese employees will also receive a monthly subsidy of one yuan.</p>
<p>Compensation for Current Living Expenses</p>
<p>The French Shanghai Daily reported on the 29th that the French Municipal Council gave its employees temporary subsidies ranging from 7% to 22% on July 4, 1938, in order to compensate for the high cost of living. At that time, this subsidy was inversely proportional to the size of the salary, that is, those with small salaries received more subsidies, and those with large salaries received less subsidies. It is now said that the temporary subsidy has been cancelled. Recently, due to the high cost of living, it has been decided to replace it with other subsidies, which are also temporary in nature, ranging from 30% to 50%.</p>
<p>Effective Period of the Salary Increase Method</p>
<p>This subsidy is also inversely proportional to the size of the salary, as before, and the subsidy for unmarried people is 10% less than that of married people in each grade. It is said that the effective period of this subsidy is as long as the French currency is between 5.5 pence and 7.5 pence in sterling, it should be paid. As for the Chinese employees, those who originally received an average salary increase of 7% in July 1938 will now receive a salary increase to 20%, and a rice subsidy of 2 yuan per month will be added. Also, as for the family subsidy for French employees, each child was only able to receive 14 yuan per month, but now it has been increased to 40 yuan per child per month. From this point of view, this new subsidy method is based on the family burden of the employees, and it is proportionally more favorable to low-salary employees.</p>
<h3>British Ships Transport Scrap Iron to Aid Japan: They Suffer Misfortune Both on Land and Sea; American Dockworkers Prevented British Ships Loaded with Iron from Passing Through; British Ship Struck a Reef and Sank; Cathay Cinema Screens Film of the Sunken Ship, Chinese and Foreign Audiences Applaud</h3>
<p>The Millard's Review reports that the British freighter "Bonnie" was carrying scrap iron destined for Japan. On June 25, it was prevented from passing through Tacoma, Washington in the United States because dockworkers refused to cross the picket line set up on the dock. The picket line was set up by the Tacoma branch of the American Committee for Non-Participation in Japanese Aggression. The head of the group is former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson, whose goal is to prevent the shipment of munitions and basic war materials from the U.S. to Japan. Another British ship, the "Tambourbar," which was also carrying scrap iron to supply Japanese munitions factories, struck a reef and sank off the coast of Quillaute, Washington on April 9. All 36 crew members were rescued, but all 8,000 tons of scrap iron were lost. News footage of the wrecked ship was recently shown at the Cathay Cinema in Shanghai, and the entire audience, both Chinese and foreign, applauded for several minutes.</p>
<h3>The Course of the Fall of Dinghai City: 1,400 Japanese Troops Landed in Three Routes; Principal of Zhoushan High School Detained by the Japanese; County Magistrate Su Benshan Is Now Defending an Isolated Island, Awaiting Reinforcements</h3>
<p>The details of the fall of Dinghai were not available until yesterday. A businessman who personally experienced the incident managed to escape and arrive in Shanghai yesterday. The account is as follows:</p>
<p>Landing Situation</p>
<p>The Japanese army's seizure of Dinghai was divided into three landing sites, namely, Shenjiamen Town, about 80 miles east of the county seat, Yancang Village, about 10 miles south of the city, and Daotou and Dongyue Temple. The Japanese troops who landed at Shenjiamen Town arrived in the city last and entered the city through the East Gate. The Japanese troops who landed at Yancang Village were second and entered the city through the West Gate. The Japanese troops who landed at Daotou first attacked the county seat through the South Gate. The number of troops on the three routes was about 1,400, and because they had guides, they all took winding paths, as if they were familiar with the roads.</p>
<p>Principal Detained</p>
<p>When the Japanese troops landed at Daotou, they used machine guns to strafe. Two Japanese warships in Jiangxin, Daotou, fired at the shore. The Quanda Soy Garden, located in Daotou, was destroyed. At that time, Fang Xiangyuan, Principal of Zhoushan Jin High School, and Chen Dehong, teacher from the Christian Church, went on board the Japanese warship to demand that the Japanese troops withdraw and not ruin the local area. However, they were detained by the Japanese army, who seemed to be using them to organize a so-called "Maintenance Association."</p>
<p>Transfer to Baiquan to Fight</p>
<p>At that time, the troops stationed at Puji Temple in the northern suburbs and all the self-defense teams in Dinghai resisted under the leadership of County Magistrate Su Mubenshan. After four hours of fierce fighting, they retreated to Fanhe Ridge due to being outnumbered, and have now transferred to fight in the Baiquan, Xiaozhan, and Dazhan areas. As for the residents of Dingcheng, they all evacuated to the mountain countryside when the incident occurred. In total, only 30 to 40 people were killed or injured in this battle, but the food stored in Baihe Temple and other places in Dongxiang was looted. Therefore, the food problem for the military and civilians who evacuated to the mountain countryside is a cause for concern.</p>
<p>A Tragic Scene</p>
<p>County Magistrate Su of Dinghai, because the incident happened suddenly, was unable to bring his wife with him at the time. When he led his troops to resist at Fanhe Ridge, his wife was escorted to him by his subordinates. County Magistrate Su immediately held his wife's hand and sobbed, saying emotionally, "When a powerful enemy is pressing on the border, local officials only know to be loyal and sacrifice their lives, and can no longer think of their families. Please do as you wish, madam, go and encourage each other!" After saying goodbye, he parted ways with his wife, with tragic words and expressions.</p>
<p>Defending a Certain Island to the Death</p>
<p>It is now known that County Magistrate Su, in addition to dispersing his troops to harass the Japanese army with guerrilla tactics, has crossed the sea to a certain island to defend it to the death while awaiting reinforcements. There are still more than 200 soldiers and civilians following him, and it is said that they have been out of food for a day. As for his wife, after saying goodbye to the county magistrate at that time, she was disguised by the county government officials, taken on a boat, and escorted to Ningbo. She has now transferred to Jinhua to report the incident to Chairman Huang. Also, when the Japanese troops landed at Daotou neck, there were three Japanese planes in the sky providing cover. As for the details of the fall of Shenjiamen, it is not very clear. All that is known is that four Japanese warships came on that day and fired at the shore, and the Zhenh濟源 Wine Shop was destroyed, it is said.</p>

<h3>地產商迭接恐嚇信　緝獲大批匪黨　冒稱游擊隊名義索詐經事主報捕設計擒獲</h3>
<p>A real estate businessman, Tang Shujian, a local resident living at No. 2, Lane 1124, Xinzha Road, who is of modest means, was targeted by bandits. In February of this year, he received three anonymous threatening letters demanding hundreds of yuan, otherwise, they would resort to extreme measures. Tang ignored them and did not report them to the police. Afterward, the bandits did not take any action, and he remained safe until, unexpectedly, between the 24th and 26th of this month, he received two threatening letters in the name of</p>
<p>Loyal and Patriotic National Salvation Corps</p>
<p>Military Committee Headquarters Guerrilla Force, with two bullets attached, demanding 850 yuan. The letters stated that if he continued to ignore them as he did in the spring, his life would be in danger. After receiving the letters, Tang Shujian secretly reported to the Gordon Road Police Station in charge of the area and arranged for the bandits to</p>
<p>Collect the Money at Tang's Residence</p>
<p>At the appointed time, Zhuang Meichu from Pudong and Zhang Guoying from Suzhou arrived, still carrying a letter from the Loyal and Patriotic National Salvation Corps to collect the money. They were captured by the police detectives Wang Chengying, Xu Decheng, Gao Huixian, Lu Gendi, Tao Aifu, and Li Baichuan, who were lying in ambush around Tang's residence.

The other defendants all gave vague answers. Judge Jiang Shuzhi ordered them to be remanded to custody separately for further investigation at a later date.</p>
<h3>賭負上吊畢命</h3>
<p>Due to Gambling Debts, He Hanged Himself.</p>
<p>Yin Maodi (29 years old) from Wusong, whose family lives at No. 25, Hongxing Lane, Bailinan Road, West Shanghai, had been gambling in Hollywood gambling dens recently. However, he lost every time, resulting in heavy debts that he could not repay. At around 6 PM yesterday, he suddenly had the idea of dying and tried to hang himself in his room. He was discovered and cut down by his family and rushed to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. He died before arriving at the hospital.</p>
<h3>明和紡織廠經理　被控侵占詐欺　要求返還存紗定洋等款被吿身份不明爭辯甚烈</h3>
<p>The manager and shareholder of Minghe Textile Factory, Wang Zuolin (59 years old, from Wuxi), located at No. 3, Xiangyu Lane, Tiantang Street, outside the New North Gate, near Fada Road, was recently sued for business embezzlement and fraud by Liang Yongaao (24 years old, from Shangchu), the shareholder and manager of Yunhua and Xinfeng Yarn and Cloth Shops at No. 24, Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road. Liang hired three lawyers, Zhu Gaorong, Li Qingmu, and Sun Zhongyao, to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court, along with a civil suit.</p>
<p>The complaint stated that</p>
<p>The plaintiff's Yunhua Yarn and Cloth Shop ordered 100 bales of 6-count Lantianma yarn from the defendant's Minghe Yarn Factory on April 18, 26, for delivery in June, July, and August, at a price of 170 yuan per bale. The Minghe Factory's order form serves as proof. After delivering 64 bales, on June 30 of the same year, a Anyuzhuang promissory note for 2,550 yuan was delivered for 15 bales of yarn. After taking out 5 bales, the remaining 10 bales were stored in Minghe Factory's warehouse, as evidenced by two Minghe Factory warehouse receipts. On July 10 of the same year, another</p>
<p>Anyuzhuang Promissory Note</p>
<p>for 1,665 yuan and 34 yuan and 1 jiao and 6 fen in cash were delivered. Ten bales of yarn were taken out and stored in Minghe Factory's warehouse. Also, in May of the same year, nine bales of Minghe Factory's 6-count Lantianma yarn were transferred from Zhengjihao at a price of 177 yuan per bale. After payment was made, the goods were stored in Minghe Factory's warehouse. A total of 29 bales of yarn were stored, all with warehouse receipts. In early August of the 26th year, when the goods were to be taken out, the defendant claimed that the situation was tense and that they were moving to a safe area in the Public Concession and told the plaintiff to come back after the move was completed. Unexpectedly, the August 13th Incident broke out, and Shanghai was in chaos. In the spring of the 27th year, when the plaintiff asked for the goods, the defendant</p>
<p>Claimed that the Goods had been Destroyed</p>
<p>as an excuse to avoid responsibility. The plaintiff originally wanted to file a lawsuit, but refrained due to friendship. Later, in another case, it was discovered that the defendant had stated in the court that Minghe Factory still had 200 bales of yarn in storage in the Jiangsu Bank warehouse and that they were sold in the autumn of the 27th year. The defendant's actions clearly constitute fraud and business embezzlement. The plaintiff requests an investigation and a civil suit, requesting the court to order the defendant to return 8,700 yuan, the value of the 29 bales of yarn in storage, and to return the deposit of 5,980 yuan for the fraud.</p>
<p>Also, Damages</p>
<p>of 31,250 yuan are requested. The court accepted the complaint and held a hearing yesterday afternoon presided over by Judge Miao Qingbang. The plaintiff and his lawyers arrived in court to state the grounds for the lawsuit. The defendant and his lawyers also arrived in court and raised a procedural objection, questioning whether the plaintiff was indeed a shareholder and manager of Yunhua Yarn Shop. Because Liang had testified in a previous case that he was an accountant, it was requested that this point be investigated first. The lawyers for both sides exchanged opinions and argued fiercely. As a result, the court adjourned the hearing and rescheduled it for 3 PM on July 4th.</p>

<h3>傭妇留書服毒案　患有神經病癥　所謂寃單所載虐待等情　依據捕房調查完全不確</h3>
<p>The Case of the Maid Who Left a Note and Took Poison. She Suffered from Nervous Disorders. According to Police Investigation, the Allegations of Abuse in the So-Called Grievance Letter Were Completely Untrue.</p>
<p>Xu Wu, a woman from Haiyan Gan, worked as a maid in the house of Wang Shenfu, the owner of Zhao Tai Foreign Goods Shop on Henan Road, British Concession. On the morning of the 23rd, she suddenly went to the Asian Hotel at Sanmao Bridge, rented a room, and committed suicide by swallowing tranquilizer pills. She also left behind a grievance letter accusing her employer of embezzling 600 yuan of her accumulated wages, selling inferior goods, and subjecting her to unbearable abuse. She entrusted Zhang Fucheng, a shop employee, with 8 yuan to buy tranquilizer pills, etc. She died after failed treatment. The police reported to the court for an examination. All the details have been</p>
<p>Detailed in Yesterday's Newspaper</p>
<p>It is now known that the French Concession Police Department dispatched officers to investigate the case and found that the claims in the deceased's grievance letter could not be confirmed. It appears that she suffered from a form of hysteria. Xu Wu and Wang Shenfu, the owner of Zhao Tai Foreign Goods Shop, were acquaintances from the same hometown. She was hired seven years ago without a guarantor, earning 5 yuan per month. In addition to using her wages gradually, she accumulated 200 yuan and a gold ring, which were stored with her employer. After her lover surnamed He died in her hometown in April of last year, she suffered</p>
<p>Nervous Breakdown</p>
<p>She took a break until November and was recommended to work for a month or so at the Shi family in Gujia Lane, Beijing Road. She was dismissed due to her erratic work. She returned to her former employer, Wang Shenfu, requesting to be rehired. Seeing that her condition was even worse than before, he refused to hire her, returned her stored wages of 200 yuan and the gold ring. After she left, she bought a set of high-quality silk funeral clothes and returned to the Wang family, hoping to be rehired. He refused and told her that if she died, she would try to frame him. Then she left and</p>
<p>Committed Suicide by Taking Poison</p>
<p>in a hotel after several months. It is also untrue that she entrusted Zhang Fucheng, a shop employee, to buy tranquilizer pills. She had pursued Zhang romantically before, but was rejected. Zhang has been back in his hometown for nearly two months to get married. Zhao Tai Foreign Goods Shop deals in woolen fabrics and goods from various Western countries and has always avoided inferior goods. The police officers reported the information to the police chief for review.</p>
<h3>小孩搶吃楊梅　輾碎腦殼　當場斃死車夫拘案</h3>
<p>A Child Tried to Grab Yangmei Plums, Had His Head Crushed, and Died on the Spot. The Driver Was Arrested.</p>
<p>At around 6 PM yesterday, a truck loaded with yangmei plums was passing in front of a fruit shop near Beijing Road and Shilu Road and was about to stop when a group of children climbed onto the truck to grab the yangmei plums. The truck suddenly reversed, and one of the children, Chen Xiaomaotou, 14 years old, from Jiangbei, lost his footing, was shaken off the truck, and had his head crushed by the rear wheel of the truck. His brains and blood flowed all over the place, and he died on the spot. A nearby Chinese police officer saw this and quickly called an ambulance to take him to Tongren Hospital. After examination by the doctor, it was determined that he could not be saved, and the body was sent to the morgue for examination. The driver of the vehicle was taken to the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3>律師被控通姦案　法院不受理　捕房是否上訴尚須考慮</h3>
<p>Lawyer Accused of Adultery. The Court Refused to Hear the Case. Whether the Police Will Appeal Is Still Under Consideration.</p>
<p>Lawyer Li (also known as Li Shude) had disagreements with his legal wife, Shen Qiwen. After Shen took their son, Bing'er, and returned to her mother's house, Li lived with his mistress, Wang Liming (originally named Lin Lizhen), in the attic at No. 15, Lane 546, Tiantong Road, enjoying their sweet life. Recently, Shen reported the matter to the Huishi Police Station, which sent detectives to arrest the couple and prosecute them for adultery in the First Special District Court. Shen also filed an accompanying civil lawsuit against Li, seeking compensation of one yuan in national currency for damages. The case has been heard and investigated twice. Details were reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday morning was the date for the verdict in the case, but both parties did not appear in person. At 9 AM, Judge Fang Qinghuan of the Criminal Division No. 8 announced the verdict: This case is not accepted. The plaintiff's accompanying civil lawsuit is dismissed. Zhang Shizhu, the lawyer prosecuting for the police station, heard the verdict and immediately stated that whether the police station would appeal the verdict was still under consideration. Therefore, the case cannot yet be considered as finally decided.</p>
<h3>萬琛醬園糾紛　被告宣告無罪　附帶民訴亦駁回</h3>
<p>Dispute at Wan Chen Soy Sauce Garden. The Defendant Was Declared Not Guilty. The Accompanying Civil Lawsuit Was Also Dismissed.</p>
<p>Wan Chen Medical Garden, located at the entrance of Lujia Lane, Xujiahui, French Concession, has been operating for more than 30 years as a partnership. In recent years, due to the poor economic situation, business has declined. On April 22 of this year, the shareholders decided at a meeting to cease operations and appointed accountant Fei Zuyi as a representative to declare liquidation. Li Yunsun, Li Yongsund, Li Runquan, Li Jimin, and others, in their capacity as shareholders, jointly hired lawyer Wu Huatai to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Division of the Special Second Court against Zhang Qiuhua, Chu Wenhan, Wu Yuanyou, Bei Peisen, Qiu Shiying, and others, shareholders of the medical garden, for joint embezzlement and theft, along with an accompanying civil lawsuit seeking compensation for damages. The defendants hired lawyer Li Wenjie and others to defend them, detailing the reasons for the closure and liquidation, and denying embezzlement and theft. The case was tried and concluded by Judge Wu Kechou. Yesterday morning, the verdict was announced: Zhang Qiuhua, Chu Wenhan, Chu Baojian, Wu Wenmo, Chu Peisen, Qiu Shiying, and others are all not guilty. The plaintiff's lawsuit in the accompanying civil lawsuit is dismissed.</p>

<p>Yang Quangen and Hou Ashun, from Wuxi, and others, were running a flower club gambling den in Room 208 of the Jue Lu Hotel on Yuqiaqing Road at around 12 PM on the 28th when they were discovered by Chinese detective Chen Ruisheng of the Lao Zha Police Station. Yang and others were arrested and 37 yuan in gambling money, 1 yuan in stamps, and 21 flower club cards were confiscated. Yesterday morning, they were taken to the Special First Court where Judge Dai sentenced Yang Quangen to eight months in prison for running an illegal gambling den for profit. Hou Ashun, Chen Wenjin, Wang Xingen, Shi Shunshan, Luo Bairong, and Xu Rongqing were each fined 30 yuan. If they were unable to pay, they would be required to perform labor service at a rate of one yuan per day. The gambling money and gambling paraphernalia were confiscated.</p>
<h3>徐家匯　折屋風潮平息</h3>
<p>Xujiahui Housing Demolition Uproar Subsided</p>
<p>Along the riverbank on the east side of Li Zongjing, Xujiahui Town, West Shanghai, facing Haige Road, from the Su Xin Bookstore at No. 1986 Hongqiao Road to the Xianghe Fried Goods Shop at No. 2182 to the south, there are more than a hundred houses, all of which have shops. However, the back doors of each house have had sheds built over them for many years. Now, the river sheds are ordered to be demolished voluntarily. At around 4 PM the day before yesterday, the French Concession Police Department sent Chinese and Western patrol officers to the scene to forcibly demolish the sheds, which aroused public outrage and led to a market strike. Fortunately, Zhou Chengxiang, chairman of the South Association, rushed to the scene to persuade them, and they all resumed business as usual. At around 9 AM yesterday morning, the French Concession Police Department summoned the shopkeepers for questioning. More than 80 people arrived. The business representatives, Hu Xiangxi, Wang Qingxiang, Jin Yongxiang, Zhuang Amao, Liu Ganchen, and Zhang Xiaodi, and others, all said that the people living in the sheds were mostly refugees who would have nowhere to live if the sheds were demolished. Also, the wood from the demolished sheds could not be reused, resulting in considerable losses. Therefore, they requested a temporary suspension of the demolition to avoid displacement. After repeated consultations, the request was approved by the Western Police Chief. As a result, the sheds will be temporarily preserved, but the space under the sheds must be filled with soil and the shopkeepers must dig up the floorboards and fill them themselves to prevent water accumulation. The shopkeepers were very satisfied upon hearing this, and the uproar subsided.</p>
<h3>僞虹橋小學校長　髮妻訴請離異　被告住址不明改期再訊</h3>
<p>The Legal Wife of the Pretended Principal of Hongqiao Primary School Sues for Divorce. The Defendant's Address is Unknown, and the Hearing is Rescheduled.</p>
<p>Kang Zuyao, a local resident who used to teach at Zhengmeng Primary School, is 36 years old and resides at No. 10, Xin Kang Lane, Rue Massenet, French Concession. He is currently the principal of Hongqiao Primary School, which is run by the puppet organization. His legal wife, Gu Runyi (35 years old, local resident, residing at No. 38, Baxianfang), recently hired lawyer Feng Song to file a lawsuit in the Civil Division of the Special Second Court,</p>
<p>Requesting a Divorce</p>
<p>It is claimed that the defendant committed adultery, malicious abandonment, and that it is unbearable to live with him. The plaintiff married the defendant in the 15th year of the Republic through a matchmaker. At first, they were on good terms, but in the 19th year, the defendant listened to malicious rumors and filed a lawsuit for divorce against the plaintiff. Later, they reconciled. In the year of the Republic of China, the defendant taught at Zhengmeng Primary School and often stayed out late on various pretexts, leading to an opium addiction and seeking pleasure with prostitutes, treating his legal wife like worn-out shoes. In February of the 24th year, the defendant intentionally abandoned her and falsely accused the plaintiff of</p>
<p>Adultery</p>
<p>After investigation by the prosecutor, it was determined that the accusation was false and the case was not prosecuted. In March of this year, the defendant cohabitated with another woman at No. 10, Xin Kang Lane, which was reported by the plaintiff to the police, resulting in their arrest. There is a record of this. At that time, the defendant begged for reconciliation and was not prosecuted. Recently, the defendant has joined the puppet organization, living a shameless life and neglecting the living expenses of his legal wife. Therefore, she earnestly requests a divorce to avoid being implicated. Yesterday, Judge Ma of the Civil Division No. 7 convened a hearing, but because the defendant's whereabouts were unknown and the summons could not be delivered, the plaintiff requested public notice of the summons. The court then decided to reschedule the hearing.</p>

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>Having read in your newspaper on June 26, on page 3, in the news column, "[...] at midnight the other day, more than a dozen short-sleeved thugs suddenly came to the Shentai Lumber Company in Xuejiawan, Shiliupu, Nanshi, each holding pistols, hatchets, iron rulers, and other weapons, broke in and robbed a [machine] and two thick copper coins, 20 zhang in length, worth approximately 4,000-5,000 yuan in total, and severely injured an elderly operator [...]"</p>
<p>We hereby inform you that our company is located at No. 1190, Nanshi Outer Ma Road, and all [plank] machines have long been moved to the North City, and none remain in Nanshi.

<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>We hereby inform you that our clients, Li Yunsun, Li Yongsund, Li Runquan, Li Jimin, shareholders of Wan Chen Soy Sauce Garden, have stated to us that, upon reading the article published in your newspaper on the 28th of this month regarding the liquidation dispute of our garden, many of the facts do not correspond to the truth. Our garden has historically had surpluses, and there is no way Runquan could have reported a loss and difficulty in sustaining operations at the shareholders' meeting on April 22nd. The claim that the appointment of Fei Zuyi for liquidation was based on a conference is even more erroneous. Furthermore, the claim that Li Yunsun and Li Yongsund do not have shareholder status and cannot be plaintiffs is incorrect. Yunsun and Yongsund are heirs of Li Boji and legally have shared ownership rights. Fearing that the outside world is unaware of the truth, which could lead to misunderstandings, we should send a letter on behalf of the representatives to correct the errors. Therefore, we respectfully request that the letter be published to serve as a correction.</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Actively Promotes Educational Films in Provinces and Cities, Adding New Areas in Various Provinces This Year</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Chongqing) Since 1936, the Ministry of Education has started organizing film education. Various provinces and cities have established mobile film education areas, which have achieved significant results. Since the start of the War of Resistance, the ministry's work on implementing film education has continued as normal. Recently, to adapt to the current needs, on the one hand, it has entrusted the Central Trust Bureau to purchase 24 sets each of generators, projectors, and slide projectors for distribution to various provinces to add new educational areas. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the number of educational areas nationwide will increase to 134. On the other hand, it has produced and purchased a large number of educational films. It has entrusted Hong Kong Yin Guang Company and Kodak Company to reprint the third and fifth series of "War of Resistance," "Defending Our Land," "Hot Blood," "Loyal Souls," "Air Force War Records," "The Battle of Shanghai and Air Defense," and "Gas Defense," among other films. It has also independently produced educational films related to wartime educational facilities. Furthermore, it has sent personnel to participate in the Southwest Border Education Inspection Group, traveling to Guiyang, Bijie, Weining, Zhaotong, Kunming, Dali, and Mengzi to film geographical customs and produce educational films. In addition, the ministry has assigned specialized personnel to be responsible for compiling and drawing slides, and several types have been completed. When the National Education Conference opens, the ministry will include the newly produced slides in the exhibition, which has received high praise. This year, in addition to actively adding new areas in various provinces, the ministry will also restore film education work in Jiangsu, Hebei, and Shanghai. Educational films in small demand for Zhejiang and Fujian, etc., are regularly sent by the ministry from Hong Kong. Therefore, the film education work in various provinces and cities has not been affected by transportation difficulties. Currently, to facilitate the promotion of film education, the ministry has specially compiled a "Film Education Handbook," which will be distributed to film education workers in various provinces to understand the storage and use of equipment and the procedures for implementation, in order to improve work efficiency.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Central Vocational School: Five Departments Currently Running, Aquaculture Department Temporarily Postponed</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) The National Central Vocational School of Technology was established in late January of this year, after the Ministry of Education hired Liu Yiyan, the former director of the Anhui Construction Department and special commissioner of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, to prepare for its establishment in Chongqing. It was initially planned to establish six departments: Agricultural Product Manufacturing, Papermaking, Leather, Textile Dyeing, Sericulture, and Aquaculture. In order to cooperate with relevant production business organizations in the establishment of each department, the school selected a certain location in Sichuan as the location of the main campus, establishing the three departments of Agricultural Product Manufacturing, Papermaking, and Textile Dyeing. The Sericulture Department was established near the Sichuan Provincial Sericulture Improvement Farm in northern Sichuan, and the Leather Department was established in another location, with detailed measures agreed upon with Huazhong University and the Sichuan Provincial Construction and Education Departments for cooperative management. The Aquaculture Department, due to equipment reasons, was approved by the Ministry of Education to be temporarily postponed. Later, in mid-February, experts were hired to serve as teachers, and curriculum standards and guidance outlines were formulated according to the goals of each department. School buildings were repaired and located in Chongqing, Chengdu, Guilin, Zhucheng, and other places to recruit students. On March 28, the list of admitted students was announced in the newspaper. Registration took place on April 18 and 23, and classes began on the 24th. Students from remote areas who were unable to report on time due to transportation difficulties were also allowed to enter the school later. Currently, the number of students who have registered in each department is 32 in Agricultural Product Manufacturing, 40 in Papermaking, 45 in Textile Dyeing, 36 in Leather, and 33 in Sericulture. Those who have been granted leave for special circumstances are not included. It is expected that the number will not differ greatly from the ministry's quota of 50 students per department. The funds for the construction of practice workshops for each department have been increased by the Ministry of Education. Recently, a construction committee has been established, and plans are being made and actively carried out.</p>
<h3>Elementary and Middle School Labor and Art Exhibition, Displayed on July 2, More Than Ten Schools Participated Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Citywide Elementary and Middle School Labor and Art Exhibition Relief Association, with the event scheduled for July 4, is working intensely these days. The association has also published a special publication for publicity. Yesterday, more than ten schools, including Lide, Quanzhang, Huacheng, Fu, International Relief Association, and Refugee Children's Middle School, registered to participate. All exhibits from each school are expected to be sent by the schools themselves to the private Shanghai High School on Chengdu Road, Jing'an Temple Road, on the afternoon of July 2 and 3, for self-design and arrangement. If there are still schools that have not reported their participation, it is hoped that they will send their exhibits to the venue for display before July 2, so that all proceeds from the charity sale can be donated to relieve the refugees. In addition, several companies, such as Wanru Architectural Model Factory, Songyun Industrial Society, and Oriental Model Paper Company, are also participating in the exhibition, donating the proceeds from sales to relief efforts. Wanru Architectural Model Paper Company has specially donated 800 sets of art model paper, entrusting students from Peicheng Elementary School to make them, which shows great enthusiasm. Hongxing Partridge Vegetable Shop will also exhibit and display at the venue and show movies to entertain guests. After the opening, it is hoped that people from all walks of life will visit, purchase the labor and art works of elementary and middle school students in the city, one to relieve the refugees, and the other to keep as a souvenir, which is truly the best.</p>

<p>Since Dongya Middle School moved from Nanshi to the Chinese Vocational Education Society on Hualong Road in the French Concession, the number of students has increased from dozens to more than 300, and the high school department has been added to the junior high school. The principal of the school, Chen Mengyu, has a deep knowledge and rich experience in running a school. The teachers he hires must be academically excellent and enthusiastic about teaching. Therefore, the school affairs are becoming increasingly prosperous. The school's tuition fees are particularly low, with tuition and miscellaneous fees of only 20 yuan per semester. In addition, no other fees are charged. Enrollment has already begun, and those who go to register are coming in an endless stream.</p>
<h3>Various Schools Hold Graduation Ceremonies</h3>

<h3>Fading Explosive Machine Joe Louis Retains World Boxing Throne Ticket Sales Exceed US$350,000 in Four Rounds Without Knockout</h3>
<p>(Urgent telegram from New York, United Press, 29th) American black Joe Louis, known as the fading explosive machine, knocked down his opponent Karen Touret in the fourth round last night, retaining the world heavyweight boxing title. At that time, there were 40,000 spectators gathered at the Yankee Stadium in the United States, and the total value of the tickets was about US$350,000. According to Joe Louis' movements, he is quite agile and swift, and both his left and right arms have great power. Although Karen Touret tried his best to resist, he finally fainted and fell to the ground. The weight of the two people was officially weighed today. Karen Touret weighed 233 and three-quarters pounds, while Joe Louis weighed 200 and three-quarters pounds. When they met by the scales, they only exchanged a very cold "Hello."</p>
<p>Course of the Fierce Battle</p>
<p>Joe Louis knocked down his strong opponent Karen Touret to the ground with his left hand before the end of the fourth round, retaining his boxing throne, taking only two minutes and thirty-nine seconds. Although Karen Touret was defeated this time, everyone said that his terrifying attack was something Joe Louis had never encountered before. Although Joe won, he also spent a lot of effort. In the first round, both sides concentrated and probed each other. When Karen Touret attacked with his left and right hands, the audience cheered. After a stalemate for a while, Karen Touret made a heavy blow with his left hand, hitting Joe's jaw, and Joe also retaliated. In the second round, Karen Touret used the same trick again, attacking with his left fist, and Joe attacked his head with a clever method, while at the same time hitting Karen Touret's jaw with his left fist. At this time, Joe's fist was like a storm, and Karen Touret was busy parrying. Later, Joe made another terrifying heavy blow, knocking Karen Touret to the ropes. Before long, the bell rang, and the second round ended. Karen Touret's nose had been injured and bleeding within three rounds, but he still fought bravely. He first attacked Joe's left, and then also returned with a powerful left fist to the jaw, causing Joe to fall to the ground, which shows his strength. But Joe immediately stood up. When the third round of fighting was about to begin, it ended. After that, the fierce fight was very intense. Joe Louis, because he had enough experience, waved a very hard left fist in a very tense situation, knocking down Karen Touret and retaining his throne.</p>

<p>National Medicine and Dietary Therapy</p>
<h3>Dietary Therapy for "Summer Heat"</h3>
<p>— Wu Shanqing</p>
<p>In the sweltering heat of summer, the most common disease is "summer heat." Regardless of gender, age, or severity, patients are not uncommon. If you feel that your hands and feet are soft, you are lazy to move, your appetite is poor, you are drowsy, your face is sallow and thin, and you are tired, then you have already suffered from summer heat. This is all caused by the hot weather and the dirty and humid environment, which leads to abnormal digestion in the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>The symptoms of summer heat were called summer withering in ancient times, because the spirit is tired, the limbs are lazy, just like the withered and unthriving plants. "Where evil gathers, its qi must be deficient." The deficiency lies in the weak intestinal digestion, which is unable to resist the hot summer, resulting in summer heat. Before getting sick, you should use nourishing foods in advance, and you should often use black dates or red dates, steaming them on the rice cooker, or boiling them in water, peeling off the skin and pits, and using them as a snack to eat often, and drinking the soup, which can strengthen the spleen and stomach, and increase resistance. The date meat contains sugar and mucilage, which can increase the oxidation power in the blood and expand the cell proliferation power, so it is often used as a mild tonic. It is advisable to eat it often before the onset of summer heat.</p>
<p>After getting sick, it is advisable to remove dampness and heat. Often eat coix seed porridge, that is, cook raw coix seed with water into porridge. It can remove dampness and heat, nourish the stomach and spleen, benefit the muscles and bones, and relax the meridians. Moreover, coix seed is the most nutritious and easily digested. The protein it contains is more than other grains. It can not only remove dampness and heat, but also help to nourish. It is a good choice to use it as a dietary therapy for summer heat.</p>
<p>Other vegetables and fruits also have the same effects, such as mung bean porridge, lentil soup, dried radish, kohlrabi, sweet pickled cucumber, salted tempeh, loofah, lily, pickled mustard tuber, water chestnut, sugar cane, watermelon, etc., which are suitable for those with summer heat to eat, because they have the effect of clearing heat and resolving dampness, benefiting qi and harmonizing blood, regulating the spleen and stomach, and benefiting the viscera. However, sour and cold fruits, sweet and fatty meats, and things that are not easily digested or stale, should all be avoided. Otherwise, if they accumulate in the gastrointestinal tract, it is inevitable that the summer heat will be accompanied by other diseases, leading to damp heat, vomiting and diarrhea, malaria, and other symptoms. Can we not be careful!</p>
<h3>"Don't Eat Too Much" Don't Seek to Be Full</h3>
<p>— Jin Zheming</p>
<p>The three words "don't eat too much" were also said by Confucius more than 2,000 years ago. Its meaning is clearly to teach people not to overeat when eating. As the saying goes, "Eat less and taste more, eat more and fill your stomach," which is a true saying. Because unrestricted indulgence in eating and drinking results in stagnation of the digestive function of the stomach and intestines, and is prone to chest tightness, abdominal distension, belching and acid reflux, loss of appetite... and many other ailments. We must understand: the effect of diet is only to increase the driving force in the body! Therefore, the principle of adopting food should be to seek its ease of digestion, richness in nutrition, and not to care about the quantity. When ingesting food, we must leave considerable room, that is, athletes must also do this (swimmers should not eat too much). People often have an abstract view that athletes must eat more, and that they must eat more meat, which is really wrong. Often many athletes suffer from stomach problems as a result. People who use their minds too much should not eat too much, and should reduce their food intake. This is because people who use their minds too much use their brains more and use their strength less. There is not much physical exertion, so there is no need to eat too much. Eating too much is harmful, because if there is a fixed amount of blood, eating too much will make the circulation in the digestive tract more vigorous, and the amount of blood will increase. At the same time, the amount of blood in the limbs and brain will decrease, resulting in anemia. The reason why you feel tired, lazy, and sleepy after eating too much is this. Especially after eating too much, people become slow in thinking and relaxed in muscles. Therefore, we should be careful and prudent according to the clear instructions of "The gentleman eats without seeking to be full" (don't eat too much).</p>
<h3>温病小誌（二）</h3>
<p>— 楊彥和</p>
<p>In discussing warm diseases, Yu Qian often mentions conditions like excessive sweating leading to Yang collapse, and fever receding while the disease remains.  These are not exhaustive, so I add further details:  Mistakenly inducing sweating injures fluids, mistaken purgation causes sudden depletion, fatigue and internal injury manifest as dazedness, coma, stiff tongue with black coating, dry throat, deafness, palpitations, and irregular pulse.  In medical terminology, these are called "grave signs". At this time, it is imperative to invigorate the Qi to dispel the disease, and to allow the righteous Qi to recover and resist the pathogenic influence. What is the method to achieve this? Wu Jutong specifically advocated the "method of preserving vitality to treat the disease". His formula is based on Ye Tianshi's eighth case of warm disease and the sixteenth case of warm heat, but ordinary people often overlook it, which is a pity! Wu specially defined this method as "Modified Fuling Mai Tang Decoction", and solemnly warned: "Even if there are other symptoms, treat them later." At this critical moment, the spirit is wavering, hanging by a thread. If we do not focus on preserving Yin and only treat the symptoms superficially, any aggravation may cause the wavering spirit to leave the body. Alas! Can one not be careful? In addition, there are formulas for rescuing Yang and Erjia (three-shell) Decoction, but one must choose and modify them according to the symptoms, and not adhere rigidly to one formula. (The end)</p>
<h3>預防失眠</h3>
<p>— 徐林炎</p>
<p>Insomnia is mostly caused by Liver Qi excess. When Liver fire rises, it leads to chest tightness, irritability, headache. Although feeling tired, it is difficult to fall asleep. Thoughts surge, and anxiety intertwines. The next morning, one feels listless and unable to concentrate. Furthermore, those with neurasthenia are particularly prone to this. With neurasthenia, sensations are exceptionally acute. Therefore, it is not only difficult to fall asleep, but even if one does, any slight noise can easily awaken them. The way to prevent it lies in self-cultivation and regulation. Try the following points according to the law, and it will be effective over time. One, cultivate a pure heart and few desires, and do not get angry or agitated. Two, reduce sexual activity. Three, avoid spicy and stimulating foods. Four, quit smoking and alcohol. Five, eat more Yin-nourishing foods. Six, ensure smooth bowel movements every day. Seven, wash feet with hot water before bed and urinate. Eight, do not talk before bed. Read briefly in bed to calm the mind, but only to the point of slight fatigue. Nine, avoid going out at night, and practice going to bed early and waking up early. Ten, bathe frequently. Eleven, take walks in the countryside to breathe fresh air. Twelve, the bedroom light should not be too bright. In summer, green curtains and light bulbs are best. Thirteen, consume Suanzaoren (Ziziphus jujuba var. spinosa seed), Lianxin (Nelumbo nucifera seed embryo), and reed root tea.</p>
<h3>告施茶者</h3>
<p>— 心仁</p>
<p>A word to those providing tea:</p>
<p>Now that summer is approaching, it is common to see a pot of cool tea placed at intersections and beside telephone poles. At the same time, there are vendors selling tea for one copper coin a bowl by the roadside. However, in this bustling city, dust flies everywhere. Even if the tea pot is free of dust, dust and flies will fly into the tea pot.</p>
<p>Coolies, sweating profusely and unbearably thirsty after working hard in the hot sun, are overjoyed to see a pot of ready-made drink. They drink it into their stomachs. As a result, the sources of diseases such as cholera, typhoid fever, and cholera also take the opportunity to invade their abdomens. Imagine the danger if they break out!</p>
<p>Therefore, I would like to make a suggestion to all the gentlemen who set up tea pots: "Please put a lid on the tea pot." This will be an immeasurable act of merit.</p>
<h3>濕令代茶妙品　橘皮</h3>
<p>— 缶鳴</p>
<p>A wonderful tea substitute for humid weather: Orange Peel</p>
<p>"One cup is tasting, two cups is quenching thirst, three cups is drinking like a donkey." This is what Jia Baoyu said in Longcui Nunnery. But drinking tea can quench thirst, and in hot weather, it increases the body's water content. One cup, two cups, ten cups, eight cups; as long as there is a physiological need, what does it matter if you drink like a donkey or an ox? In this summer season, the body's water loss increases daily, and adding beverages is inevitable. Modern beverages such as soda and fruit juice are not affordable for ordinary people. With rising prices, even tea leaves are not necessarily affordable for everyone. In our country's custom, when guests come, tea is served. If plain water is used, it is considered stingy. But now, we might as well advocate a compromise: use orange peel instead of tea leaves. The method is to take orange peel and dry it in the sun, then cut it into thin strips with force. (Regardless of Guangqiao, Fuju, or honey oranges, as long as it is an orange, its peel can be used.) It can be stored for a long time without spoiling. Take a handful of orange peel strips, put them in a cup, and pour in boiling water. After a few minutes, it can be drunk. The color is clear and green, and the taste is fragrant. If you pour it into a cup to serve guests, no one will believe it is orange peel brewed. And its effect is to regulate dampness, guide stagnation, and invigorate the stomach. Long-term use has the effect of removing bad breath.</p>

<h3>夫婦之愛得進行曲</h3>
<p>The Love of Couples Must Advance</p>
<p>Because the enlightenment of social evolution makes us believe that in the highest society, matters between men and women will especially emphasize love, and the love of couples will be regarded as the most precious life experience, and will no longer be defamed but will be envied. However, the things in between are often contradictory. In occasions where genuine free love is possible, the hearts of both men and women will expand. According to psychologists, a romantic man is constantly seeking, at any time and any place, the freedom, beauty, and adventure that his ancestors were able to find in the young forest. The heart of his desire is opened, and can simply accommodate more than a dozen women! Although women are not as intense as men, they also dislike the permanent relationship between couples. Lascivious women are fickle. If they were not bound by moral concepts, which woman would not be fickle?</p>
<p>Escape is never a way to solve difficulties. Only struggle is the best way to solve difficulties. Contradiction is a necessary stage in evolution. With contradiction, there is consensus. Positive and negative cancel each other out, and a new individual is born from this. If love is what we need, then we should strive to make it complete. The expansion of desire in men and women in love is precisely their expression of vitality in life. This vitality can encourage them to be brave, move forward, and make their lives happy and comforting! If the husband and wife are healthy and beautiful, and also understand the secrets of love, so that everyone can freely bring the love and interest into unity, pay attention to the promotion of health to meet the requirements of his and her desire when it expands, and make love eternal, this is the sweetest and happiest! In short, the promotion of the love of couples is greatly related to health. If a man suffers from masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or indulges in debauchery after marriage, consuming too much of the life source of the reproductive gland fluid, then symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, asthenospermia, infertility, and neurasthenia will follow. Such a sick husband, not only because of lack of energy, has no achievement in his career and academics, and is rejected by society, but also cannot have a happy life in his married life, is hated by his wife, leading to the breakdown of love, and staging all kinds of tragedies! This is the man's own fault, how can he blame his wife for being fickle? To try to remedy it, it is necessary to cure this kind of hidden disease. According to world-renowned doctors and my experience, taking reproductive gland hormone preparations [Reproductin] is the most effective treatment. Because this agent is of precious quality and has definite efficacy, it can produce sperm, nourish the kidney, strengthen the brain, activate blood, nourish nerves, and promote development within one day and night after taking it. Continued use will surely cure the above symptoms in a short period of time, and can make the body healthier. Only those with spermatorrhea need to also take [Hemet's Spermacrasia Tablets] (available in large pharmacies such as Wuzhou Chinese and Western Medicine Pharmacy, etc.) to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage, so that the treatment addresses both the root and the branches, and the effect is even faster!</p>
<p>健美</p>
<p>Physical Beauty</p>
<h3>乳峯在健美上的價值</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>The Value of the Breast Mound in Physical Beauty</p>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Trendy makeup and eyebrow painting, skeletal thinness is shameful! Do you know the modern beauty? Tall breasts and fat hips show off their charm.</p>
<p>Due to the turbulent situation, there are now many wealthy wives and young ladies who have come to Shanghai from other places to seek refuge on this isolated island. As soon as they set foot on the Bund, it is as if Grandma Liu has entered the Grand View Garden for the first time. They feel that everything they see and hear is wonderful and spectacular. What they especially admire and feel the need to imitate is the new clothes of modern women. They think that since they have become Shanghainese, they must learn to speak the Shanghai dialect. Therefore, regardless of their figure, they get perms, leather shoes, purses, and short-sleeved qipaos. Applying powder and rouge, painting their faces and dabbing their lips, they are transformed in one day and dare to enter social circles, complacent with themselves. How would they know that while they are feeling smug, people are sneering at them behind their backs!</p>
<p>This is not nonsense, because what they pay attention to is only clothing, thinking that as long as the clothing is new, they will naturally look good. Actually, it is not like that. You must know that what modern people are advocating for female beauty is the curve beauty composed of towering breasts, plump buttocks, and fine waist, which is also healthy beauty. However, inland women do not pay attention to breast development. The more aristocratic the family, the more they bind their breasts. Therefore, women with atrophied breasts, thin hips, and loss of health and beauty are everywhere. Even if such women put on extremely gorgeous new clothes, they still feel skinny, as if they are wearing a lantern case, wide and empty, with no fleshy, touching beauty. Therefore, no matter how new their faces are, or how sophisticated their decorations are, they still cannot hide their ugliness!</p>
<p>To be a new age woman, please spend less money on unnecessary decorations, and quickly think about health and beauty. If the breasts are atrophied and health and beauty are lost, they should immediately use ovarian endocrine preparations, which are generally recognized for women as taking ovarian preparations for women. The [Reproductin] is used to compensate. This agent was invented by American physician Dr. Dana after more than 30 years of arduous experiments, and has been verified by many European and American doctors, who believe that the medicinal properties are mild and the efficacy is great.

<p>Why Does Long-Term Spermatorrhea Cause a Sallow Complexion and Skinny Appearance?</p>
<p>— Zhan Nianceng, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>Young people with sallow complexions and skinny appearances are prevalent in today's society. They are not in that state due to not being able to get enough food or clothing. According to our investigation, most of them have committed masturbation and spermatorrhea. After a young person reaches the age of fifteen or sixteen, it is a natural phenomenon for semen to be produced in the reproductive organs due to physiological maturity. But this semen is usually stored in the seminal vesicles and is intended for the sacred function of reproduction. How can it be trifled with? However, most curious and ignorant young people cannot restrain their sexual impulses or are tempted by bad environments, and commit masturbation. There are truly countless people who commit masturbation, and because the indulgence of masturbation destroys the sexual nerves and relaxes the sperm gate, even more people suffer from spermatorrhea.</p>
<p>Those who suffer from spermatorrhea are described by doctors as being possessed by a blood-sucking demon, because one drop of semen is as precious as eighty drops of blood, and one instance of spermatorrhea is equivalent to one pound of blood loss. Then, it is probably a better phenomenon to have a sallow complexion and skinny appearance due to long-term spermatorrhea. Semen is the reproductive gland fluid in our body. Part of it is stored in the seminal vesicles through the vas deferens, and part of it directly seeps into the blood, irrigates the whole body, and functions to adjust metabolism, invigorate development, and nourish all nerves. Therefore, long-term spermatorrhea will inevitably reduce metabolism. In various tissues, only old cells die, and few new cells are produced. How can this not cause a sallow complexion, a skinny appearance, and premature aging? At the same time, it is difficult to escape symptoms such as incomplete development, neurasthenia, and kidney deficiency. Therefore, it is not an exaggeration to say that masturbation and spermatorrhea in young people is equivalent to chronic suicide. To seek remedy, one must take the special medicine for treating spermatorrhea, take "Hemet's Spermacrasia Tablets", to strengthen the sperm gate and calm the nerves, and spermatorrhea can be cured that night. Those who already have the above-mentioned symptoms due to spermatorrhea must also take the reproductive gland hormone preparation "Reproductin" to nourish the brain, kidney, and nerves, promote development, and adjust metabolism. It will surely restore perfect health in a short period of time. If patients can come to this clinic for electrotherapy and injections, a cure can be guaranteed.</p>

<h3>尿中忽然出血的淋病</h3>
<p>Gonorrhea with Sudden Bleeding in the Urine</p>
<p>In the daily cases of gonorrhea that we doctors encounter, there are many patients who are inexplicably frightened by the sudden bleeding in their urine. In fact, there is no need to be so alarmed. Gonorrhea with bleeding in the urine is a symptom of gonorrheal cystitis, which is often encountered. The cause of cystitis is, in seven or eight out of ten cases, due to the result of local instrument surgery, because impure surgery often causes gonococci to reach the bladder from the posterior urethra during the procedure, thus eroding the bladder mucosa and causing cystitis. At this time, the urine is completely turbid, and even bloody urine may erupt. The most serious case is bleeding inside the bladder. When the rupture of blood vessels is large, the blood serum accumulates in the bladder, making the urine completely red. Fortunately, this kind of phenomenon is not always seen. Generally speaking, it is only during urination that a small amount of bleeding occurs due to the contraction of the bladder wall muscles. As for the bleeding in the bladder, it is often in the posterior part, because gonococci often invade the bladder neck. The characteristic of this symptom is that the lower abdomen and the pubic joint feel tingling, and this tingling radiates to the tip of the penis during urination.</p>
<p>When treating this symptom, attention should be paid to the severity of the symptom. Some are suitable for bladder irrigation, some are suitable for warm compresses, some are suitable for taking diuretics, and the latest chemotherapy has a special effect on this symptom. However, the surgery used in treating this symptom must still be quick and skilled. Otherwise, if the wound is further damaged, it will be like adding fire to the river, and the situation will become even worse. Therefore, patients with gonorrhea who see blood in their urine must not choose a doctor indiscriminately or take over-the-counter drugs indiscriminately. They should seek a doctor with experience who is willing to take responsibility.</p>

<p>Finance: Bulls Take Advantage of High Prices to Exit, Gold Prices Rise Sharply and Slightly Rebound, First Trade Exceeds 600 Yuan Mark, Transaction Volume Around 700 Taels</p>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold price in the black market, although the range of change was not as large as the previous day, the market trend was still uncertain. The reason is that people's hearts are hard to change. Initially, due to the continued sharp drop in foreign banks and the weakening of foreign exchange, coupled with the vigorous buying intention of the securities firms, the market opened at a high of 2,605 yuan. Then, due to the spot gold traders taking advantage of the high prices to sell, and a certain money exchange firm selling all the bull positions it had entered the previous day to take profits, the market situation once turned weak and fell back to a low of 2,580 yuan. Afterwards, due to the upward sentiment and the strong pull by major players, the price rose again to 2,596 yuan. However, it finally closed at 2,590 yuan, an increase of 22 yuan compared with the previous day. Trading was still active, reaching about 700 taels for the whole day. The price of gold ornaments in jewelry stores also rose first, then fell, and then rose again, finally increasing by 2 yuan. The customs gold price remained flat, while the price of Chinese-British pure gold slightly increased.</p>
<p>烚赤尙漲念二元</p>
<p>Spot Gold Still Increased by 22 Yuan</p>
<p>Since this morning, each bar (ten taels), initially carrying on the remaining momentum from the previous day, and with the weakening of foreign exchange and the sharp drop in foreign silver, coupled with the sudden stop of congestion and the turn to buying by the securities firms, and with sellers extremely scarce, the price was under the pressure of buying orders, and soared by 37 yuan at the opening. First, the securities firms bought 50 taels from the spot gold traders, at a price of 2,605 yuan. Then, the money exchange firm sold 50 taels to the securities firms, at a price of 600 yuan. Later, the spot gold traders sold 10 taels to the money exchange firm, at a price of 604 yuan. At this time, the money exchange firm that had entered the market the previous day suddenly took advantage of the high prices to take profits, and the market situation immediately turned downwards, falling by 9 yuan in an instant. A certain silver firm sold 50 taels to the securities firms, at a price of 595 yuan. Then it fell another 5 yuan. A certain silver exchange firm sold 50 taels to its peers and 10 taels to the gold firms, all at a price of 590 yuan. Then it fell another 5 yuan. A certain money exchange firm sold 50 taels to its peers and jewelry stores, all at a price of 585 yuan. At this time, the securities firms also had selling intentions, so the price fell again by 5 yuan. A certain money exchange firm and securities firm each sold 50 taels to a certain silver firm, all at a price of 580 yuan. After this, the buying sentiment suddenly turned strong again, and the news was that everyone was holding a wait-and-see attitude, which caused the market to strengthen again. Before long, it soared by 15 yuan. The jewelry stores bought 50 taels from the spot gold traders, at a price of 595 yuan. Then the money exchange firms did some inter-trading for 10 taels, at a price of 596 yuan. Later, the money exchange firms bought 50 taels from the jewelry stores, at a price of 594 yuan. Approaching noon, the market situation turned flat. The gold firms bought 50 taels from the jewelry stores, and the jewelry stores bought 50 taels from a certain silver firm, all at a price of 592 yuan, which was the closing price for the noon session. In the afternoon, the transaction volume suddenly became sparse and the trend was flat and sluggish. The market opened 2 yuan lower. The spot gold traders sold 50 taels to the jewelry stores, at a price of 590 yuan. At this time, retail investors came to sell a little, and the trend continued downwards. The money exchange firms did some inter-trading for 30 taels, at a price of 588 yuan. Then it fell another 1 yuan. The gold firms did some inter-trading for 20 taels, at a price of 587 yuan. Then the retail investors sold 50 taels to the money exchange firms, at a price of 588 yuan. At this time, the money exchange firms had a good appetite, so the price rebounded slightly. At 2:45 PM, the gold firms sold 30 taels to the money exchange firms, at 2,590 yuan, which was the closing price for the evening session. As a result, it increased by 22 yuan compared with the previous day, with a fluctuation of 25 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the spot gold traders' own brand gold was 2,595 yuan, and the buying price was 2,585 yuan. The current bid gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, very few short sales were done.</p>
<p>首飾金更動三次</p>
<p>The Price of Gold Ornaments Changed Three Times</p>
<p>The selling price of gold ornaments in jewelry stores per tael, initially did not change. But at 9:52 AM, because the spot gold price at the opening was strong, they all raised the price to 263 yuan. Shortly after, at 10:15 AM, because the spot gold price suddenly rebounded, they also lowered the price to 261 yuan. Later, at 12:00 noon, because the spot gold price secretly strengthened again, they raised the price by 2 yuan again. After that, there was no change. It is estimated that the major firms changed the price to 263 yuan, while the small firms changed the price to 261 yuan, and the buying price was 255 yuan.</p>

<h3>月杪結款浩繁　外匯續見緊縮　掉期合息又在四分光景</h3>
<p>At the End of the Month, Settlements Are Numerous, Foreign Exchange Continues to Tighten, Swap Interest Rate Is Again Around 4 Points</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation, the HSBC listed price, no changes. Black market conditions, initially carrying on the remaining momentum from the previous day, coupled with the end of the month approaching, the oil companies such as Asia and Texaco and other foreign firms, settlements are even more frequent. Although the day banks and Hong Kong Electric and Chinese textile firms (bulls exiting) successively sold, and Sassoon also turned to selling for the month, but foreign banks' appetite suddenly strengthened, which caused the market to continue to tighten. The British gold was once the tightest at 6 points 53125, and the US exchange rate also weakened to 12.75 yuan. Afterwards, because silver companies and foreign banks' selling intention was slightly stronger, the situation turned flat. As a result, the US exchange rate was weaker than the British, because the British-US inter-exchange rate shrunk. The futures market also once tightened at first, but later the congestion of the Hong Kong Electric returned to flat. Currently, the distance between the spot and July British gold is 28125, and the US exchange rate also differs by 5625. The bank's deposit interest rate is about 4.5 points, while the actual monthly interest rate for arbitragers is only 3.78 points. However, it is not easy for Chinese merchants to deposit and there is no legal currency, so the transaction was not completed. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, it continued to tighten because foreign firms settled frequently, and finally shrunk by 625 again.</p>
<p>沙遜日商尚有賣出</p>
<p>Sassoon and Japanese Merchants Still Had Selling</p>
<p>In the early morning, the London large bars, near and far, fell sharply by 75, the New York silver price continued to fall miserably by 1.5 points, the London raw gold by half a point, the exchange rate British to US small by 1 point 3, to Shanghai down by 25, to France no change, US to British small by 125, to Shanghai down by 2 jiao 5 fen, to France shrunk by 0625. The central listing of various exchanges remained the same.</p>
<p>The bank's morning opening spot selling price, British gold was 6 points 625, US exchange rate was 12 yuan 9375, compared to the previous close, British flat US tight 03125, is the reason for the British-US opening exchange rate shrinkage. After opening, oil companies and other settlements were frequent, and foreign firms' sellers were thin, while the appetite was good, so the potential immediately tightened. First, HSBC absorbed the spot British gold of Japanese banks and foreign electricity in Hong Kong for 6 points 625, then the oil companies Texaco and Asia competed to absorb the HSBC spot British gold 6 points 59375 and 5625, until the HSBC listing was announced without moving, and the white silver balance tax was announced exempt, after this, the foreign China Datong certain banks successively absorbed the spot US exchange rate of Japanese banks and Chinese merchants for 12 yuan 875 and 8125, at which time foreign companies' settlements were still frequent, so the potential became tighter. The bank selected the tightest British gold as 6 points 53125, the weakest US exchange rate as 12 yuan 75. Approaching noon, Japanese banks and Western merchants Sassoon successively sold to Bombay Silver Company and foreign banks the July British gold for 6 points 28125, and the same month US exchange rate for 12 yuan 25, the situation was also tight. Later, foreign companies settled the Hong Kong exchange rate for 44 yuan and a half, the situation was quite tight. Extended to noon closing, the British-US exchange rate slightly hardened, the bank's spot selling price British gold was 6 points 59375, US exchange rate was 12 yuan 875.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the market situation turned slightly stable</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the foreign companies continued to settle, HSBC's spot British gold was 6 points 59375, and it also settled Datong's spot US exchange rate of 12 yuan 84375, then the silver company sold the spot US exchange rate of 12 yuan 875 to a certain bank, the market situation was quite stable. Later, Hong Kong Electric sold the July spot British gold of 6 points 3125 to foreign firms, the situation saw a slight hardening, later the Netherlands sold the spot price of 44 yuan and a half to foreign firms, the situation lacked change, until the evening close, the bank's spot selling price, British gold 6 points 59375, US exchange rate 12 yuan 875.

<h3>Economic Implications of the Blockade of the Tianjin Concessions (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Gu Xiao</p>
<p>Coercing Foreign Banks into Connection with Counterfeit Currency</p>
<p>After the establishment of the "United Reserve Bank" in North China, it issued "United Reserve Bank" notes. However, foreign banks in the concessions generally adopted a passive attitude and refused to cooperate with this bank, unanimously refusing to use the "United Reserve Bank" notes. Even if they were used, these counterfeit notes could only be recorded separately and used exclusively for trade with Japan. They could not be used to purchase foreign exchange. Moreover, more than 300 foreign stores inside and outside the concessions preferred to sacrifice business and reduce their scope rather than use counterfeit currency. Therefore, this blockade by the Japanese also aimed to coerce foreign banks and stores in the concessions to use the "United Reserve Bank" notes and recognize them as currency. However, things backfired. After the blockade of Tianjin Concessions, an order was issued within the concessions to completely ban the use of counterfeit currency as retaliation. This was something that the Japanese had not anticipated.</p>
<p>Looting 50 Million Silver Dollars within the Concessions</p>
<p>It is estimated that the silver stored in North China, specifically in Tianjin, includes:</p>
<p>Bank of China: 18,349,981 yuan</p>
<p>Bank of Communications: 20,612,599 yuan</p>
<p>Total: 38,962,580 yuan</p>
<p>In Beiping:</p>
<p>Bank of China: 6,592,359 yuan</p>
<p>Bank of Communications: 8,865,867 yuan</p>
<p>Central Bank: 100,315 yuan</p>
<p>Total: 15,558,501 yuan</p>
<p>Total for Beiping and Tianjin: 54,521,121 yuan</p>
<p>Since the fall of Beiping and Tianjin, this sum of 54,521,121 silver dollars has been stored in the vaults of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications within the British and French Concessions of Tianjin. The Japanese have long harbored the intention to loot it. On February 7th of last year, the puppet "Provisional Government" attempted to seize it and organized the so-called "Cash Custody Committee of the Two Cities of Beijing and Tianjin," forcing the two banks in the concessions to hand over the silver for "acceptance." The British and French Concession authorities insisted on their neutral stance and refused. In March, when the puppet "United Reserve Bank" was established, it again attempted to loot the silver to use as a foundation for issuing counterfeit currency. However, both attempts failed. Later, the Japanese further demanded that the British and French Concession authorities jointly form a committee with the Japanese to seal off the silver, but this was never accepted by the concessions. Therefore, the Japanese and their puppets have been constantly thinking about the silver, intending to loot it to satisfy their desires.</p>
<p>In summary, the above four points are the major objectives of the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin Concessions. Because Japan has occupied North China for nearly two years, its strength is insufficient to fully realize its ambition of domination. As a result, it has shifted its anger to the concessions. The cause was by no means accidental. This time, it merely used the issue of extraditing criminals as a fuse to create trouble. The ultimate goal is to completely eliminate the rights and interests of the powers in the entire North China region. This blockade is just one step in their implementation plan. (The End)</p>
<h3>British and American Gold Pounds Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, pure British gold rose by half an ounce; British-American exchange rates fell by 0.125; local foreign exchange banks had substantial settlements; foreign banks provided smooth settlements; the market condition was tight at first and then eased. As a result, the British exchange rate was 6 ounces and 59.375, a rise of 0.03125. The American exchange rate was 12.785 yuan, also a rise of 0.09375. The Shanghai gold market opened high, continuing the upward trend of the previous day. Gold shop customers were excited to buy, pushing the price to a high of 2,605 yuan. Later, money exchange businesses took advantage of the high prices to sell and settle profits. Furthermore, exchange rates eased, falling to a low of 2,580 yuan. The market recovered in the afternoon, fluctuating around 2,590 yuan. Trading was sparse, and fluctuations were narrow. The evening closing price was 2,590 yuan, a rise of 22 yuan compared to the previous day. Foreign currency, British and American gold pounds, remained in high demand. Due to the high rise in the Shanghai gold market, market prices all increased. British and American gold notes were in high demand, and market prices slightly decreased. Hong Kong notes, French francs, Dutch guilders, etc., were in slight demand, trending slightly higher. The supply of Japanese gold notes increased relatively, and the market condition eased. The evening market price was 9 jiao, 8 fen, and 6 li. Korean notes were also rarely needed, and the price was 9 jiao. Transactions by the association were not active. Ren Tai offered 10 British gold pounds to Qin Tai, and Hou Ji offered 200 American gold notes to Cheng Tai, and also offered 300 American gold notes to Tong Yuan.

<h3>Old Banknotes Gradually Decreasing, More New Banknotes Seen</h3>
<p>In recent days, it has been widely rumored in the market that the banknotes issued by various banks are mostly old banknotes from various commercial banks. However, since recently, these banknotes have become rare. Not only that, but more new banknotes are being issued, which proves that the substitution of miscellaneous banknotes for the banknotes of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications is groundless, and that the payment capabilities of various bank notes are abundant and not expected to be exhausted, which is particularly obvious. This has been the case for several days. However, small banks do have considerable difficulties.</p>
<h3>Lingering Impact: Silver Prices Continue to Plunge</h3>
<p>A London dispatch on the 28th reported that the silver market's downward trend intensified, with India and speculators rushing to sell. The market was unstable. After the closing, there were inflows and outflows at a price 0.0625 higher than the listed price. Large bars of silver, both near-term and far-term, plunged again by 0.75. A New York silver dispatch reported that the spot price in the US continued to fall sharply, plummeting by another 1.5 fen. A Bombay silver dispatch reported that the Indian silver market was increasingly weak, with spot prices plummeting by 25 annas, and prices for July and August both plummeting by 26 annas.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Steps Lower</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange drafts continued to fall, at 95 yuan per thousand in the morning and retreating to 92 yuan in the afternoon, a further decrease of 3 yuan compared to the previous day. The interest rate for interbank loans from the Money Trade Association remained at 0.22 yuan for both the morning and afternoon sessions, it is said.</p>
<h3>Banks to Conduct Semi-Annual Settlements Today; Check Clearing Extended to 4:45 PM</h3>
<p>Today is the day when banks customarily conduct their semi-annual settlements. The Joint Reserve Committee of the banking industry in this city has specially extended the check clearing time to facilitate interbank check collection and delivery, scheduling it to begin from 4:45 PM. The time for collecting checks on behalf of others will remain the same. It is reported that the committee has already sent circulars to all banks to follow suit. (Y)</p>
<h3>Securities: Jardine Matheson Shares Most Active</h3>
<p>In the stock market of the exchanges, Jardine Matheson shares continued to be the most active, with 6,700 shares changing hands at prices between 19 yuan and 18.70 yuan. Other stocks also showed slight progress in market sentiment, with a large number of buyers appearing and prices becoming slightly more leveled. Tramway shares changed hands at 40.075 yuan, and Wheelock Marden shares rose slightly to a price of 35 yuan. It seems that both the general public and speculators are adopting a wait-and-see strategy to await the resolution of the Tianjin Incident. However, it is speculated that the European situation is unlikely to conclude in the very short term. Rubber stocks showed slight demand. The corporate bond market remained sluggish, with only the 5.5% power utility bond showing slight demand at 82.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The listed prices of Far East companies' stocks traded in London for British merchants on the 28th of this month (Wednesday) showed only slight fluctuations in bank stocks. Mercantile Bank shares rose by 5 shillings, with a price of 7 pounds and 5 shillings. HSBC Hong Kong-registered shares fell by 1.5 pounds, with a price of 80.5 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The listed prices of Chinese foreign debts traded in London on the 28th of this month (Wednesday) showed that the Rehabilitation Loan's British and French bond notes rose by 1.5 pounds, with a price of 32.5 pounds. The rest remained unchanged. Trading prices: Rehabilitation Loan, British issue, buying in at 31.5 pounds, selling out at 33.5 pounds; French issue with stamp, buying in at 29 pounds, selling out at 31 pounds. Spot goods for sale in England, including 7,000 pounds of Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway bonds, are priced at 15.5 pounds, 1.5 pounds above the market.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Foreign Exchange Shrinks Again; Spot Yarn Buying Spree Erupts; Double Horse and Earth Brands Soar by Around 20 Yuan; Japanese Yarn Transactions Also Convert to Exchange Clearing</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn black market suddenly trended upward, and the upward trend became heated again, but actual transactions were not very developed, due to the impact of transportation obstructions. However, the general perception of rising prices among those in the trade remained deep. As soon as a good opportunity arose, they rushed to lift prices, and the lifting force was especially strong. It was found that the lowest price of 20-count Double Horse yarn had reached 475 yuan on the previous day. Yesterday, the highest price reached 494 yuan, a surge of around 20 yuan in the space of one day. However, customer sales were not smooth, and financial conditions could not be relaxed immediately. Most market transactions were in units of ten bales. Upon investigation, the reasons for the rise were that foreign exchange had shrunk again to 6 ounces flat, gold had risen slightly, and the trend of trade had rebounded. There were more buyers than sellers at the opening call in the morning, and the opening price immediately rose by 4.5 yuan. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn at foreign godowns was 484.5 yuan, and the godown receipt price was 478 yuan. After a short while, the momentum tightened again. Some major customers had sold a lot on the previous day, and they took no action today. Merchants were dried up and rushed to buy in after hearing some good news. The market gradually hardened step by step. By the time of closing, 20-count Double Horse yarn was priced at 490 yuan, and the godown receipt was 485 yuan. The market reopened in the afternoon and rose another 3 to 4 yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 494 yuan to 493.5 yuan, and the godown receipt was 489 yuan. It was found that the total purchases by various groups throughout the day were about 700 to 800 bales. Only the Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shantou groups of customers made purchases, with most transactions still being among those in the trade. The market price for 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 16 yuan, Double Earth yarn rose by 18 yuan, and Shepherd yarn rose by 6 yuan. 10-count coarse yarn was flat and firm. It was found that 250 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Hong Kong yesterday, and another 450 pieces were shipped to Haiphong.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market will be closed from July 1st due to the financial industry's semi-annual settlements, and will reopen on July 4th, it is said.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market showed slight signs of a turnaround, because Japanese factories, aware that the discount rate was high and that spot cash was especially scarce on the market, had no choice but to follow the trend and converted to using exchange clearing in order to promote sales. As a result, the trend became slightly more flexible, and market prices rebounded slightly. However, sales were still flat. The spot price of 20-count Yueqin yarn was 385 yuan to 388 yuan.</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign Cotton Transactions Are on the Verge of Stagnation; Large Batches of Indian Cotton Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: The New York cotton market was still considered firm in the early morning, rising slightly by 2 to 3 points. Later, due to purchases by those in the trade and favorable telegrams from Bombay, it entered a good phase. In the middle, the price of silver suddenly fell, causing panic among the people. Furthermore, the government's newly drafted legislation for the cotton industry placed many restrictions on transactions among those in the trade, and the weather in the cotton-growing areas was reported to be good, triggering settlements and abandonments from all sides. At the close, cotton prices fell by more than 10 points compared to the previous day, and Indian futures also predicted a drop of more than 1 rupee, and Egyptian cotton fell by 3 to 5 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai's foreign cotton transactions: Since the government restricted withdrawals on the 22nd, financial conditions have tightened daily, and transactions have become increasingly difficult. Meanwhile, the number of arrivals is increasing daily, and factories are finding it difficult to raise funds and have temporarily stated that new transactions are impossible. Furthermore, foreign firms are suffering excessive losses due to the swap of exchange bills between this month and next month, and are extremely anxious. Yesterday, a certain foreign firm even sent its entire staff to collect banknotes from various manufacturers. Many in the trade, facing difficulties in raising funds, are also selling off their inventories at low prices.</p>
<p>Domestic cotton transactions have completely fallen into a state of stagnation. Only packages that have not been opened are left untouched. Factories, in the face of a lack of legal tender, are also unwilling to take any action. Furthermore, most Chinese factories have reserves of raw cotton for several months of use, and there is no sign of panic. As for foreign cotton transacted among those in the trade and resold to other factories, most market conditions appear slightly weak. Sources from northern Jiangsu are also not strong. Dock arrivals only included 165 bales from Tongzhou, which were transacted. Those in the trade took 800 pieces of Bairoke cotton, priced at 88.5 yuan, and also took 200 pieces of New Special Flower cotton, priced at 74.5 yuan, both delivered to godowns on a spot yarn basis.</p>
<p>Indian cotton continues to be shipped to China. Yesterday, the British company "Rahore" arrived in Shanghai with 2,707 tons of cotton loaded from Bombay. Yesterday, it docked at Qichang Godown in Pudong for unloading. Furthermore, the company's "Ghitral" came to Shanghai from London, and also loaded 882 pieces of cotton when passing through Bombay. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 25th. However, due to slight damage to its machinery, it was repaired in Hong Kong. The work has been completed, and it set sail from Hong Kong to Shanghai the day before yesterday, and is expected to arrive in port this morning. It is scheduled to dock at floating docks 11 and 12 for unloading and transshipment (Zu).</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Many Cloth Factories Implement Reduced Working Hours; Exchange Clearing Notes Require Additional Premiums; Domestic and Foreign Factories Have Agreed to Ship Goods</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the spot sales market for cloth was dismal, and sales prices continued to decline. Only small amounts of about a thousand pieces were transacted by the Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong customer groups. Business on this street was also lackluster, but still better than the customer groups. Transactions in retail pieces and assorted goods in Jiangzhe inland areas such as Bengbu continued without interruption. Wholesale shops on this street purchased more than 100 pieces of white cloth, coarse cloth, crepe de chine, thread fabrics, colored cloth, colored foreign yarn, and printed goods. Various dyeing and weaving factories, due to the shrinking sales of their products, are considering stopping work or reducing working hours, and many have already implemented this. They are also willing to relax prices on their inventory in an attempt to reduce heavy burdens, which has led those in the trade and customer groups to intend to purchase and hoard at low prices. However, due to tight financial conditions, transactions were not active. About 200 pieces of goods such as broadcloth, straight-sell flannel, fine cloth, and coarse cloth were transacted, all transferred to godowns for spot collateral. Market prices were chaotic, with less difference in white goods. Prices were generally lower than on the previous day, with no increases.</p>
<p>Eastern Cloth</p>
<p>In the white goods market, transactions were sluggish due to a lack of actual sales. However, most of those who sold short and bought short were forced to settle prices at the end of the month, as they could not delay any longer. The market price of Dragon Head fine cloth was once reduced to 13.5 yuan the day before yesterday, but yesterday, both domestic and foreign factories could ship goods with exchange clearing notes. Although premiums were required, the selling prices were again strengthened, and bullish sentiment returned to drag prices up. The spot price of Dragon Head fine cloth for this month increased to 14 yuan, and the price for the next month was 14.4 yuan. Transactions reached 200 to 300 bales. 75 pieces of cloth were shipped to Yantai on the 29th.</p>
<h3>Grains: Wheat Shows Slight Turnaround; Flour Still Difficult to Activate</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, spot flour transactions with customer groups were still limited by factories' firm sales for cash, and it was difficult to activate them. Except for a few who needed to touch the market, there were no large transactions. Even on this street, due to the banking semi-annual settlement period at the end of June, both financial conditions and cash were tight, and retail transactions were not high. The factory prices for No. 2 flour have not changed temporarily, and a decision will generally be made after the banks reopen next week. 30,000 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin yesterday.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the source of new wheat gradually reached the port in scattered quantities. Arrivals were mostly cart wheat, because ship wheat transactions are not as convenient as cart wheat. On the sales side, the factories were silent, but fortunately, with the patronage of those on this street and domestic customers, the market has gradually recovered. Because the freight owners' costs are high, they mostly firmly insist on storage in godowns, waiting for good prices to sell. They are unwilling to sell off cheaply again. Yesterday, the market rebounded by 3 to 5 fen, and it is estimated that a total of more than 800 bags were sold to Danyang, Taicang, Kunshan, Nanjing, etc., at prices of 6.68 yuan to 6.55 yuan.</p>
<h3>The Hot Weather Makes It Easy for the Rice to Spoil; Rice Prices Fall More and More Sharply; Sales Are Limited to This Street</h3>
<p>Du Geng: Since the concession authorities strictly ordered price limits and financial relations, the domestic rice market has been declining all the way. Yesterday, the downward trend was even stronger. In fact, hoarders saw that the market was only heading downward, and it was the summer season, so rice was difficult to hold for long. Furthermore, the banking industry would be closed for three days for settlements. The marketers were eager to sell quickly, mutually chasing each other, but sales were limited to this street, causing the market to fall more and more sharply. As a result, both thick and thin geng rice continued to fall by 2 to 3 jiao to 4 jiao.</p>
<p>Ke Geng: Yesterday, 2,000 to 3,000 bags of heads arrived. Hoarders still had sales. The market was originally soft, but inland groups, etc., heard that rice prices in the Hangzhou area had fallen sharply by 4 to 5 jiao, and their purchases became weak. In total, only 400 to 500 bags of rough rice were sold. There was no smooth movement among various households on this street. In total, no more than 3,000 bags were transacted, and market prices fell by 2 to 3 jiao. Those that had been stored for a long time and were generating heat fell by 3 to 4 jiao. However, Du Yangjian and Bu Jian rice, although scarce in the market, were also affected by geng rice and fell by more than 2 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: After the new Dingxi Huang No. 1 and No. 2 rice was verified, the atmosphere in the market had already changed. However, there is not much foreign rice floating on the current market. Gao Saigon is still asking for 23 yuan for delivery including freight, but buyers find the price low.</p>
<p>Glutinous Rice: Yesterday, the sentiment in the rice market changed, because its sales were weak, so it also fell by 2 jiao. Hong Kong glutinous rice was also weak, falling by 3 to 4 jiao, now opening at 19.6 yuan to 19.8 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Various Beans and Rice Each Have Their Own Sales Channels</h3>
<p>Yesterday, most miscellaneous grain transactions were still in the real sales market. There was a slight increase in purchases by various groups due to the fact that the banking industry would be on holiday from July 1st for semi-annual settlements, so the market conditions for various grains remained stable. It is estimated that 200 bags of Dalian soybeans were sold (market prices are detailed in the market price section), 50 bags of Hankou Zha beans, 300 bags of Dingbai Pi beans, 260 bags of Wuhu Bai Pi beans, 100 bags of Chongming Runpian Bai Pi beans, 30 bags of Wuhu Mao peas, over 100 bags of Zhangjiakou beans, 80 bags of Chongming red beans, and over 90 bags of Chongming corn.</p>
<p>490 bags of beans arrived from Tianjin yesterday.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Huizhou White Opening at a Weak 29 Yuan</h3>
<p>According to foreign reports, there were no changes in the sugar markets of the Netherlands and Hong Kong. However, the London market continued to rise, with August rising by 0.75 to 8 shillings and 1.5 pence, December unchanged, and March of next year rising by 0.25 to 6 shillings and 3.75 pence. In the local Sugar Merchants Association's spot market, August fell by 0.2 jiao. Spot goods: Four Coarse White were originally priced at 19.2 yuan, 20.6 yuan at foreign warehouses, and the transshipment price for newly arrived goods rose to 20.8 yuan. Taikoo Armed White of the upper grade rose by 0.1 to 0.2 jiao, West Warehouse B Mark at 29 yuan, 200 bags were transacted, CW Mark at 28.8 yuan, CX Mark at 28.5 yuan, and DY and HX Marks were unchanged. The original prices were maintained for other Che Chi, He Chi, and local cotton white sugars. Yufeng Henghao opened trading on about 200 bags of Huizhou white sugar, with the higher price at 27.8 yuan to 27.4 yuan, and the next highest at 27.1 to 27.2 yuan. Yesterday, 100 bags of imported sugar came from Tianjin and 340 bags came from Beihai.</p>

<h3>Newspapers, Public Opinion, and Journalists</h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>Some say that newspaper reporters are uncrowned kings, which may be too much flattery. However, this statement accurately reflects the importance of public opinion in modern society, and therefore the responsibility of newspaper reporters, who wield this important task, cannot be regarded as simply a cultural endeavor. Newspapers have become spiritual necessities for general society. A modern person, regardless of the degree of education they have received, may no longer read many books after leaving school due to their occupation or other reasons, but they rarely stop reading newspapers—regardless of whether they are interested in editorials or theater advertisements, political news or scandalous news. Even lower-class figures who are considered illiterate or semi-literate often want to hear "what the newspaper man is saying." (Based on my personal experience, progressive laborers are more enthusiastic about reading newspapers than the average person.)</p>
<p>Newspapers have become educational tools for the general public today—education that is far more meaningful than school education. A modern organized country has what is called a press policy. A political or social movement cannot succeed without the promotion of public opinion. The importance of newspapers in peacetime cannot be overstated, and the importance of newspapers in a wartime country is even greater—in other words, the responsibility of reporters is even greater. Modern warfare is so-called national power warfare. Whether it is material or spiritual power, all must be mobilized to participate in the war. Public opinion is a spiritual force that cannot be underestimated. The propaganda war between belligerent countries is mainly based on the war of public opinion. The scope of this war is even greater than the actual war's cannons and fire. This demonstrates the power of the pen, which is sometimes not only "like a knife" but also has influence surpassing a knife. The best evidence is the situation in Shanghai for the year and a half since the National Army left Shanghai. The fact that four million Shanghai citizens have always been loyal and righteous citizens of the Republic of China is attributable to the power of public opinion.</p>
<p>Although the job of a reporter has its position of honor, we know that the general living conditions of Chinese reporters are not good, and sometimes even inferior to ordinary occupations. I remember that Shen Bao published a "Visit to Mr. Feng Bingnan" not long ago, at the end of which there was a paragraph about Mr. Feng's concern for the life of reporters. He said that he had two wishes in his later years: one was to establish an organization to benefit the common people; the other was to set up an organization to care for the bereaved families of reporters. This shows that the life of a reporter is very hard, but the job is quite heavy. Precisely because of this, people without higher spiritual cultivation than technical qualifications cannot fulfill this task.</p>
<p>Writing this, looking back at the internal status of the Shanghai journalism world, there are many things to be happy about, but there are also many things that make people frown. Apart from the vulgar tabloids that specialize in teaching prostitution and theft (because there are also good small newspapers, so I specifically say vulgar tabloids), it is really hard to find a few satisfactory ones among the first-rate, second-rate, and third-rate major newspapers. Economic conditions are certainly an important reason, but the lack of correct understanding of the task itself by journalists is also a major reason. In my personal opinion, the lack of spiritual and academic cultivation of the reporters themselves is a major cause of the poverty of newspaper content. But this phenomenon is not enough to be pessimistic about. China is in transition, and Shanghai is a distorted society. Any legitimate undertaking has parasites. It is impossible to eradicate them all at once because of social conditions. We only hope that the official leaders and practitioners of the journalism world will mutually supervise and cooperate to prevent the dark forces from increasingly encroaching on the journalism world.</p>
<p>Finally, let me declare that this article is just a mix of suggestions and feelings and has absolutely no intention or effect of offending anyone—although the feelings are not without basis.</p>
<h3>Hurry</h3>
<p>— Xu Qing</p>
<p>"Old Ling! Buck up! There's a village just beyond the bend!"</p>
<p>Two hairy arms were supporting me. I was dizzy and sweating, and the sweat was cold. My head was shaking, even though it was a hot summer.</p>
<p>White clouds were hiding in the corner of the western sky, and the fields were silent.</p>
<p>Climbing a low hill, crossing a mountain ridge, there was no sign of human habitation, not a drop of water.</p>
<p>"Old Liu! I'm about to fall!" I gasped, like a wounded wild dog.</p>
<p>"Old Ling! Don't worry, look at the source of light over there! There are houses where there's flowing water!"</p>
<p>I opened my half-unconscious eyes and looked. Two verdant peaks were lined up over there, and a silvery stream greeted the sun's high rays, sparkling.</p>
<p>"Then we have hope!" I smiled, and my spirits lifted, even though it was just a vague hope.</p>
<p>Old Liu was my comrade-in-arms of the last two years. He was a head taller than me, with broad shoulders and a wasp waist that almost formed a triangle. His whole body of purplish-black skin concealed a pure white soul. He could carry a wounded friend for dozens of miles, endure hunger to give the steamed bun to others, but he would pretend to be very calm and say, "No! I have enough!"</p>
<p>This mission asked us to hurry a long distance. The road was desolate enough. When I opened my eyes, there was only Old Liu and me. Under the blazing sun, under the guidance of the Big Dipper, we walked and walked and walked. We got countless blisters under our feet.</p>
<p>"Old Liu! I'm dizzy!" Finally, I fainted on the slope.</p>
<p>Water lapped at my chest and forehead, and I woke up again.</p>
<p>I drank a lot of water, drinking all of my water, and all of Old Liu's water.</p>
<p>"Old Ling! Buck up! There's a village just beyond the bend!"</p>
<p>I was dizzy and sweating, and the sweat was cold.</p>
<p>The sun was setting over the mountain corner, and the road was getting darker. A group of indigo traders came down the hill.</p>
<p>"Hey! Folks! Excuse me! Is there an inn?"</p>
<p>The leading man pointed and said, "Isn't that a collection of houses?"</p>
<p>"Great! Hope has finally been realized!"</p>
<p>Evening smoke rose behind the ridge.</p>
<h3>Wishing Everyone a Firm Footing</h3>
<p>— Lun Ting</p>
<p>After the storm came, it hasn't left yet, on the contrary, its evil power is increasing. During this period, one careless move could lead to the danger of falling, or straying into a wrong path, walking into a trap.</p>
<p>The reason why evil forces are evil is something even a three-year-old child knows clearly. Unless someone is insane, or obsessed with wealth and doesn't care about excessive pampering, they would recognize the thief as their father, follow the evil forces, not only follow them but also fuel the flames and increase their power. For these people who willingly degenerate, we still hope that they will turn over a new leaf and correct their past mistakes. Otherwise, the law of the land and morality will naturally punish them.</p>
<p>Those who willingly degenerate are, of course, a minority. But we cannot deny that besides this minority, there are still many people who are panicked and whose footing is starting to shake as the evil forces intensify. I will risk being considered a bore and loudly proclaim: I wish everyone would stand firm!</p>
<p>Most young people are full of vigor. They may not recognize things truly at first, but once they do, they will resolutely persist to the end and never compromise. Now that they have recognized what the evil forces are, they will never be subdued by them. Therefore, besides praising and encouraging them, I am completely at ease and have nothing else to say.</p>
<p>I am somewhat less at ease about middle-aged people. Their understanding of things is certainly genuine, but most of them bear the responsibility of supporting their families. In the midst of this difficult life, they cannot rely on their own efforts to earn a living. In order to survive, they inevitably have to resort to drinking poison to quench their thirst. The path is truly dangerous. I wish they would make a firm decision not to be fooled, and if they are about to be fooled, they would pull back from the brink and turn back immediately! The most difficult are the elderly. Some have been frustrated all their lives and want to use this opportunity to vent their anger; others have forgotten the ancient teaching of "be wary of getting," and want to fill their insatiable desires. Of course, there are also those who are forced by the pressure of life. I want to tell them that this is a dead end. Not only will they not be able to vent their anger, but they will also leave behind a bad name for ten thousand years. They will absolutely not get rich this way; what is taken in must be taken out!</p>
<p>The evil forces of the storm are openly attacking us. We can only stand firm and resist desperately. Even if we cannot win in the short term, we will eventually achieve the final victory. Even if one or two people die trying, they will ultimately preserve the upright existence of the majority. We don't need to worry, as long as we stand firm! It seems that new blows are gradually coming, and some expected pressures may indeed appear. If we want to be human beings, people who are not ashamed before Heaven and not ashamed before others, we will stand firm, not surrender, and not compromise!</p>
<h3>Impelling Attack</h3>
<h3>A Bundle of Messy Grass</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Heroes</p>
<p>In the stories children read, the emphasized and glorified figures are always deified heroes. The young minds are filled with a colossal shadow. Truly flesh-and-blood warriors, on the other hand, seem rather blurred.</p>
<p>During the day, Xuanzi sang the lotus drop song: "Seeking heroes who save the country and protect the people." I showed him a photo of a warrior, but he wasn't interested, looking somewhat disappointed, as if it lacked the magic he had imagined.</p>
<p>Ever since I understood the sadness in the saying "One general achieves fame on ten thousand bones," I lost my wonder for heroes. Heroes who have lost their cause often meet with misfortune. At the end of the road, they can only sigh deeply, vainly crying out "Heaven is destroying me!" Didn't that unparalleled hero eventually die lonely on the island of Saint Helena?</p>
<p>We sing praises of the collective body, award the collective, the isolated individual is always insignificant. Join the collective, dedicate yourself to the collective, we are all heroes of the nation.</p>
<p>Now is the era of the collective.</p>
<h3>Untitled</h3>
<p>— Jie Qi</p>
<p>Cannot hear the ticking of the clock, cannot see the sun racing by, the sky darkens, the sky brightens again.</p>
<p>Swallowing food hastily, rushing east and west, sweat beads covering the forehead; thus the road slips under the feet, all kinds of things escape from hands and minds, forgotten, blurred, leaving behind only sweat stains, and hurried breaths.</p>
<p>Sometimes, life can be as profound and mysterious as climbing high mountains, crossing steep ridges, wading through wide rivers, and traversing vast oceans, things that should be eternally engraved in the heart, but the still waters of consciousness gently carry away the wonders!</p>
<p>Finally, eating, rushing, and sweating in carefree ease!</p>
<p>Thus the rapid passage of time is welcomed and seen off in a daze.</p>
<p>Everyone will eventually awaken, and the more blurred things are, the sooner one will feel clear-headed and despise the past life.</p>
<p>I am no exception; I will also be very clear-headed. The future is a dead end; continuing to walk down it will become so narrow that there will be no room to stand.</p>
<p>The sweat stains have accumulated thickly, and the hurried breaths are almost suffocating; life is gradually growing old, and vision and mind are becoming duller day by day. The result will be an extremely tragic fate, and the road will be completely impassable.</p>
<p>I raise my hands and lift my feet, feeling that they still have some strength, enough for other actions.</p>
<p>While my mind can still be sharpened and my eyes can still see the distance, I will seek a new path and ponder how to move forward!</p>
<p>It seems that someone is waving to me again. Indeed, the bright road needs countless clear-headed young people to be witnesses and leaders, as long as their feet move forward!</p>
<p>Hearing the ticking of the clock, seeing the sun racing by, the sky darkens, the sky brightens. Every minute and every second has the value of life!</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Visiting Tongue Painting Expert Huang Ernan</h3>
<p>— Lan Yan</p>
<p>Tomorrow at Aurora University, Painting Exhibition Held, 5 to 6 PM On-Site Tongue Painting Performance</p>
<p>Tongue painting expert Huang Ernan has arrived in Shanghai and has been staying for half a month. Yesterday afternoon at 4 PM, the Shanghai art community specially welcomed him at the Xin Ya Tea Room on Nanjing Road, and I had the opportunity to chat with him for half an hour.</p>
<p>The location where I met him was Room 304 of the China Hotel. Also present were his two female disciples.</p>
<p>Speaking with a fluent Beijing accent and sporting a short mustache on his lips, his face was very ruddy and his voice was loud. He said that he was already 56 years old this year, and his spirit was much worse than before. A painting eight feet long used to be completed within two hours, but now it must be painted in two days. Indeed, this thing is too tiring.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang asked his female disciples to unfold an eight-foot-long tongue painting for us to see. The bamboo and rocks painted on it were created using three inches of an imperishable tongue to paint the bamboo leaves and stones. This is indeed an arduous task.</p>
<p>Now, I will write down the details of Mr. Huang's speech here.</p>
<p>Three Difficulties of Tongue Painting</p>
<p>Regarding the specialized technique of "tongue painting," Mr. Huang said that it is not an easy task. Those who do not have a deep understanding of traditional Chinese painting cannot start.</p>
<p>First: When painting, one relies on a burst of energy, a mouthful of air held in the mouth. Without this air, one cannot paint anything.</p>
<p>Second: When the tongue is painting, the eyes are only an inch away from the paper, and the eyes are no longer effective. At this time, you can only keep a rough draft on the painting surface, otherwise you won't know where to start.</p>
<p>Third: When painting, the head must not only move up and down, but also swing left and right. If the spirit is not good, you will immediately feel dizzy.</p>
<p>Based on these points, you can know the difficulty of "tongue painting."</p>
<p>How to Paint Tongue Painting?</p>
<p>The method of tongue painting and the prior preparations are very simple, according to Mr. Huang. First, rinse your mouth with brandy, then fill your mouth with ink, and wave the three-inch tongue tip on the prepared paper or silk.</p>
<p>I asked Mr. Huang how to handle colored paintings. Mr. Huang said that the colors he uses are all Chinese pigments, so there is no problem when painting. Only one yellow color (knee yellow) is toxic, so it cannot be ingested. When he was in Beijing, a doctor at Peking Union Medical College gave him a non-toxic yellow color, but unfortunately this pigment has been used up and a substitute pigment cannot be found for the time being.</p>
<p>Served as Cavalry Brigade Commander</p>
<p>Mr. Huang left Beijing after the "July 7th" incident. His family is still in Beijing. When he left Beijing in a hurry after the incident, he only carried sixty yuan for travel expenses. But along the way, in places such as Datong, Southern Jin, Xi'an, Chengdu, all the way to Kunming, then to Hong Kong, and then to Shanghai, the amount he painted in Xi'an and Chengdu for disaster relief children and various school scholarships totaled more than four thousand yuan, while his own travel expenses totaled six thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang advocates painting more for disaster relief children, but in the inland, especially under the fierce air raids, who is still interested in buying paintings? But for the sake of friends, artists, art and drama in various places, the introduction is considered to contribute a bit of strength to the country.</p>
<p>Two Exhibition Painting Societies</p>
<p>Mr. Huang was in Shanghai eleven years ago. On the surface, Shanghai does not seem to have changed much. Old friends in Shanghai, such as Liu Yazi from the former Southern Society, have not yet met. Many Chinese and Western painters in Shanghai met yesterday, and he was very happy.</p>
<p>Although he has been in Shanghai for half a month, he rarely goes out. Mainly, he is rushing to paint fifty paintings for Aurora University, which are to be used for an exhibition to be held on July 1st. Mr. Huang is also preparing to personally perform "tongue painting," with the time being from 5 to 6 PM. The income from the ticket sales and the purchase of paintings will be used for the Aurora University "Scholarship."</p>
<p>After the Aurora exhibition ends, Mr. Chu Qiaqing and Mr. Yuan Ludeng are preparing to hold an exhibition for Mr. Huang at the Ningbo Fellow Association, and half of the income will be allocated to disaster relief children. However, the date has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Regarding his own experience in learning tongue painting, it has been more than ten years. He began learning in 1928. In the early days, the subjects he painted were bamboo and rocks, and later he painted flowing water, flowers, and birds.</p>
<p>He himself had always lived a military life in the army, and he once served as a cavalry brigade commander. It seems very interesting that a soldier transformed into an expert in "tongue painting."</p>
<p>Two Novel Paintings</p>
<p>Yesterday, he painted two very novel paintings in the hotel. The painting method is to use the colors of the petals and branches of flowers to paint the original flowers (using fingers). For example, when painting roses, use rose petals and rose branches and leaves to paint, without using other colors. The painted roses are still purple-red roses, and the green branches and leaves are still the original colors.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mr. Huang's exhibition will open tomorrow. Those who like to admire Mr. Huang's tongue paintings may wish to visit Aurora University.</p>
<h3>Mr. Huang Ernan's "Tongue Painting"</h3>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 13: Encouraging Learning, Storing Talent for the Country; Retaining the Strong, Eliminating the Weak, Selecting Seeds with a Field.</p>
<p>At this time, Zhu Ai'ren asked: "Father! (The Suzhou people's term for 'village head') You said that our visit today to open a factory is the third one. Who are the other two? We don't know." Village head Zhu said: "You are busy with hospital matters all day long, so naturally you don't know. The first one was already signed for a land lease half a year ago, and the factory building has already been built. That is a paper mill, but it is not large-scale. If it were to produce the kind of paper for newspapers, such as web paper, it would require a large scale and large capital. This small place is not enough to use. Don't we have a paper mill in Lan Yu, Zhejiang, that specializes in making web paper? This one here is small-scale. I heard that their capital is only 500,000 yuan. They are semi-mechanized and semi-manual, specializing in making daily-use paper products, using bamboo and wood waste as raw materials, and selling them to the inland. Now China uses more and more paper. In the past, much of it was foreign paper, and imports were really high every year. Now many of our paper products are made domestically, which recovers a lot. The most ridiculous thing is that we used to see too many imported goods, and we also clamored to boycott foreign goods and promote domestic goods. We wrote slogans and distributed leaflets, making a lot of noise. But on closer inspection, the pens and paper used for writing slogans and distributing leaflets were foreign goods, wasn't that ridiculous? Now that factory focuses on daily-use paper, half of which is made by hand. I very much agree, because China has so many people, and manual labor must be vigorously promoted." The two Miss He listened with great interest and said: "Then Freedom Village will open many factories in the future, because the water and land transportation here is very convenient!" Village head Zhu shook his head and said: "That's not possible! For this matter, we have held several meetings in the village. One resolution was that within ten years, Freedom Village is not allowed to build more than ten factories. Moreover, these factories must all belong to light industry, and the establishment of each factory must be reviewed by our village to see if it is harmful to the village. Because recently, many factories, even though they are light industry, still harm the local area. For example, they are chemical industries. Are these chemical materials toxic? How do they discharge waste? If the discharged waste is toxic and flows into the water, is it harmful to the villagers? Also, how can the villagers not find the smoke from the chimneys annoying? And the sound of the machines, rumbling all day long. And if business is good, and the factory works overnight, will it disturb the villagers' sleep? All of these must be considered." (149)</p>
<h3>Punishing Another Kind of Criminal</h3>
<p>— Mei Qiao</p>
<p>A robber who steals is punished, but now there are many people whose acts of robbery go unpunished.</p>
<p>When a landlord rents out a house, they charge a key money; when a sub-landlord transfers a house, they collude with the big landlord's accounting office and demand a large transfer fee; especially a sub-landlord, who rents a house for fifty yuan, charges sixty yuan for the entire floor. The concession authorities restrict rent increases, but the restrictions only apply to the big landlords, while the sub-landlords openly extort, evict tenants, and force rent increases, as if they live in a society without any laws, because they have not been punished.</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that those who are exploited by them are all from the middle and lower classes. Half or even most of their income is used for rent. Which society has such a distorted image? The landlords are guilty of obtaining property by fraud, but not only are they not punished, but they themselves seem to be the judges, able to arbitrarily force rent increases or evict tenants.</p>
<p>Now, who will speak for the countless tenants in Shanghai who rent three or four rooms? Of course, this responsibility should be borne by the authorities of the two concessions. At present, an organization should be established to specifically solve the rent problem, so that the suffering of the tenants can be redressed, and the social thieves, those open robbers, can be punished. We have seen many cases of fighting, murder, and litigation over rent issues. Now that the standard of living is becoming higher and higher, the landlords are becoming more and more ruthless. We should also have a "safety first" campaign in this regard. We believe that this "safety" is more important than "safety" on the road, more concerning to the majority of people, and more beneficial to the security and order of the two concessions.</p>
<h3>"I Love Sailors"</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>"Give me a sailor"</p>
<p>This Diane Davis, second only to Martha Lambeth, seems to have won the Miss Legs competition last year. Therefore, in "I Love Sailors," this "Thirteen O'Clock" Miss is not only able to sing and make noise, but the director also wears "Won the National Miss Legs Competition," special leg close-ups, etc. From this starting point, the content of "I Love Sailors" can be imagined.</p>
<p>We have seen many films about "military discipline," although they are all the same, praising the solemnity of military schools and encouraging young people to serve the country, this solemn theme is still worthy of praise, such as "A Patriot's Heart," which writes about a military doctor who fled during a war, and later felt ashamed to see his son who was studying at a military school. This contrasting writing is enough to encourage people's hearts, and make people with white powder on their noses feel ashamed, right?</p>
<p>But when it comes to movies about "sailor" life, it's either "song and dance" or "fooling around." This "I Love Sailors" is a comical love affair between a pair of brothers and a pair of sisters that unfolds from sliding down the muzzle of a navy gun. In fact, Martha Lambeth is an actress who can act. If the screenwriter and director can abandon this "business eye" that is not a "business eye," and give her an opportunity to fully act.</p>
<h3>"Children's Debt"</h3>
<p>"Boy Trouble"</p>
<p>Parents with many children are often envied as "blessed," while parents humbly say "they are all debt collectors"! From this, it can be seen that Chinese people all regard their children as a kind of private "property."</p>
<p>Although "Children's Debt" does not directly address this issue, it satirizes treating children as private property to some extent. After Homer and Wendy had a conflict, Wendy believed that Homer was anxious about his son. And Homer's wife went to the orphanage to bring Zoe back, which gave Homer even more trouble; however, Homer finally adopted them.</p>
<p>Because of the decision of the role of Chili Rogers, the director purely wrote "Children's Debt" as a comedy; however, the plain narration makes the whole play seem very loose.</p>
<p>Chili Rogers' Homer cannot be said to be bad. Both children can also act.</p>

<h3>Has Stalin Seen Our Play?</h3>
<p>— Li Feishu</p>
<p>Random Memories of Mei Bian, Part Four (II)</p>
<p>During the meal, whatever we needed, this waiter would translate for us. He also told us about the local customs and conditions of Vladivostok without hesitation. After the meal, we became more and more spirited! From the naming of the selected hotel (Chelyuskin is the name of an exploration ship) to talk about Arctic exploration, from exploration to talk about the forests of Northwest Siberia, from the forests to talk about the development of collective farms and industry, and then to the Five-Year Plan, and then to the world situation, from the world situation to suddenly change course and talk about China's problems, especially the problems between China and Japan, as if counting family treasures! Talking eloquently like a river bursting its banks! We talked for more than eleven hours. Only then did we disperse in high spirits. Unexpectedly, on the first night of arriving in Russia, we had "the first lesson of the Soviet." Group member Guo Jun Jianying thought that Soviet education was too developed! An ordinary employee actually knew so much! But I suspect, I suspect that he is a secret detective from the International Police Agency, and I am afraid he is also a propagandist! Mr. Yu Youren also said: "The Russians appoint those who are specially trained in their party to entertain tourists and journalists." So we decided to treat ourselves as radios, listening with our ears, but not uttering a word.</p>
<p>From the time Mr. Mei arrived in the Soviet Union until he left, a staff member of the Soviet Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries was dispatched to entertain him. In Mr. Mei's car, there was even a "bodyguard," a burly and taciturn man who only spoke his native language. As for English, German, and Chinese, he said he did not understand any of them. Readers! Did he really not speak foreign languages? No! He not only spoke English, French, and German, but also spoke Chinese and Mandarin perfectly! How did we discover this? Before Mr. Mei left Moscow, because he had been following him day and night, protecting him closely, Mr. Mei wanted to give him some money as a reward for his spirit, but he refused to accept it! At the same time, he asked Mr. Mei to give him a signed photo and books about Chinese drama. At this time, he spoke very fluent Chinese, saying "Thank you!" very smoothly! Mr. Mei was greatly surprised! He asked him: "Have you been to China? Why do you speak such good Chinese?" He, this mysterious bodyguard, replied "smiling without saying a word."</p>
<p>When we were in the Soviet Union (spring of 1935), the Trotskyites and the so-called "red turnips" had not yet been completely purged (the red turnip has a red skin and a white inside, used to represent "the White Russians who superficially obey the Soviets." These people were mostly in Siberia, all exiled there. When our train passed through Siberia, the curtains had to be drawn to prevent attacks. But in the process of going back and forth, we were still unable to avoid being greeted by bricks twice, almost hitting the bright head of the great musician Xu Lanyuan. Since the strict purge last year, this situation may no longer exist.) Therefore, Mr. Mei's car had to have a bodyguard to avoid endangering the distinguished guest. At the same time, it may have also been intended to monitor, to see what the initial comments of foreigners on socialism were. (The Soviets deeply understand that "comments in front of the face" are mostly false, and "comments behind the back" are the truth.) In fact, the impression we got at ordinary times (mainly with Minju drama) was that one or two out of ten were debatable, and eight or nine out of ten were commendable. Therefore, no matter how strict their dispatched detectives were, we asked ourselves that we had nothing to feel guilty about.</p>
<h3>As I Heard It: Yan Jupeng</h3>
<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>Of today's "Laosheng" performers of the Li school, only Yan Jupeng and Tan Fuying remain, as Shu Dang's voice is ailing, and Shuang Kui is deceased. While Tan Fuying is undoubtedly good, judging by experience and skill, he seems inferior to Yan Jupeng. Therefore, Yan Jupeng is esteemed as the sole authentic Tan school Laosheng of recent times. Yan Jupeng transitioned from an amateur to a professional, achieving his current level of artistry through diligent effort. Here, I briefly recount his early history to supplement the lacking details in the article "Farewell to Poverty, Welcome to Prosperity."</p>
<p>Yan Jupeng's original name was [blank], and he was the direct great-grandson of Song Wenqing Gong Jun of the late Qing Dynasty. He had two brothers, and Yan Jupeng was the youngest. From a young age, he was fond of Peking Opera. In the second year of the Republic, he worked at [blank], where he befriended Tong Hu'ai (Bo Xiyuan). He sought advice from Tong Wu, eventually becoming his student. The first play he learned was "Battle of Puguan," marking the beginning of Yan Jupeng's artistic training. At the time, Lao Tan (Xinpei) was performing in the old capital, and Yan Jupeng never missed a performance, regardless of the weather. If he lacked the money for a ticket, he would borrow from friends, determined to understand everything. His deep fascination with Lao Tan is evident. Yan Jupeng listened to Lao Tan's performances with extraordinary focus, memorizing the lyrics and gestures of each play. He would then seek advice from Tong Wu, who sometimes consulted Qian Duofu, Wang Changlin, and Wang Yaoqing to provide guidance, as these two Wangs and Qian had all previously performed with Lao Tan. Yan Jupeng greatly benefited from the guidance of Qian and the Wangs. Around 1917 or 1918, Chen Yanheng lived in old Beijing and became close friends with Yan Jupeng. Chen asked about the most insightful studies of Tan's art, and Yan Jupeng's skills were already quite developed. With Chen Yanheng's explanations of the plays, his artistry greatly improved. At that time, Yan Jupeng occasionally made guest appearances as an amateur (the posters would say "Mr. Yan Jupeng"), which caused a sensation in the nine cities of Beijing. The northerners often referred to Yan Jupeng as "the second Lao Tan." Yan Jupeng first came to Shanghai more than ten years ago, the same year Mei (Lanfang) and Cheng (Yanqiu) were both performing there. Yan Jupeng came with Lanfang. Although the posters still read "Mr. Yan Jupeng," he had actually been officially hired.</p>
<p>There was a time when Yan Jupeng was incredibly popular, but his popularity led to a change in his voice. The reasons for this were twofold: first, failed speculation in public bonds, where wealth and fate intertwined, causing Yan Jupeng excessive stress; second, indulgence in vices, which ruined his voice. In addition, he experienced many family problems, causing his once-great voice to deteriorate. Yan Jupeng, out of necessity, developed what became known as the "Yan style." While the "Yan style" was welcomed by some, it was ultimately less valuable than the "authentic Tan school," leading to Yan Jupeng's disappointment in recent years, with his reputation and status falling behind Tan Shiying, Ma Lianliang, and others.</p>
<p>Now, Yan Jupeng has long abandoned all vices, and his voice has regained the quality it had ten years ago. Yan Jupeng has studied Tan's style for nearly thirty years and can be considered one of the most insightful students of Tan's school in recent times. Although his appearance is not ideal and his martial arts skills are somewhat lacking, his hand gestures, eye movements, body postures, and footwork are all excellent. In particular, his clear enunciation and precise pronunciation are unmatched by others. Yan Jupeng will perform at the Golden Stage tonight. I write this article as a message to those who support Yan Jupeng, hoping he can truly inherit the mantle of the Tan school, which would not only ensure the continuation of Tan's legacy but also be good news for the audience.</p>

<h3>Recent News from the Storytelling Theaters</h3>
<p>— Jin Xiu</p>
<p>Business in general is sluggish. Summer is traditionally a "slow month" for storytelling theaters, so many of them have a practice of "summer closure." Because the costs of running a storytelling theater are low, and the facilities are generally simple and inadequate, there is little air conditioning or electric fans (and even if there are, the number of installations is definitely not large). Listeners are reluctant to sit in the stuffy, hot stalls. Therefore, business declines to some extent every summer. Currently, in Shanghai's storytelling theaters, it is rare to see even seventy percent of the seats filled, and the evening performances are even emptier. The "Huyuan" evening performances have been suspended, and "Yiyuan" has been forced to switch to performing "Women's Literary Drama." Even the leader of the storytelling theaters, Quan Quan, has had to reduce the number of performances and shorten the time. However, there is another major reason for the particularly bleak business in the storytelling theaters this summer, and that is the high cost of goods and the rising cost of living. Most of those who frequent storytelling theaters are from the lower and middle classes, and they feel the financial strain and have to economize. As a result, they visit storytelling theaters less often.</p>
<p>The whereabouts of Huang Yian: Huang Yian is famous for singing "Romance of the West Chamber" in storytelling theaters. Since the suicide of Zhu Lan'an of Yushan, who was also involved in the [blank] affair, Yi'an is the only one left who performs "Romance of the West Chamber." Because something rare is valuable, Huang has had great success and became famous for a time. Recently, he suddenly "cut his shows" at all the venues where he was performing, and his whereabouts are mysterious, with conflicting reports. Some say he is ill, some say he has opened a gambling den and become rich, and some even suspect he is involved in a romantic affair. Old listeners, because they value "Romance of the West Chamber," cannot help but be concerned about Huang's whereabouts.</p>
<p>Wen Suchen quietly leaves Shanghai: Wen Suchen, who was active in the entertainment circles of Shanghai, was originally a popular figure. Whether in Peking Opera or Yue Opera venues, he was warmly welcomed by audiences everywhere. A film company even planned to adapt his stories into films, making him extremely popular for a time. However, Tang Zailiang's storytelling performances of "Wen Suchen" at the "Huyuan" and "Yiyuan" storytelling theaters have been met with resistance everywhere, and they are not well-received by the audience. He was even met with boos and jeers. Wen Suchen could not bear this humiliation and had to quietly leave Shanghai to seek other opportunities.</p>
<h3>Yuan Meiyun Resurfaces</h3>
<p>Yuan Meiyun has a long history in the film industry. However, the film she starred in that was most popular, needless to say, everyone knows was "The Girl Incarnate" in 1936. Because Yuan Meiyun played the role of a young man, cutting off her hair and wearing a suit, it caused a sensation in the city. It was truly a unique play, especially with the addition of the treasures Han Lan'gen and Guan Anda. The film was particularly outstanding, and the audience welcomed it even more. So, the following year, Yuan Meiyun filmed "The Girl Incarnate Sequel," and the situation was even more enthusiastic. Everyone knew about it, and everyone enjoyed watching it. Yuan Meiyun could not stop. This year, she had to resurface to meet everyone's expectations. Now, "The Girl Incarnate Part 3" is being screened at the New Light Theater, and the materials in "Part 3" are particularly rich. So it's really a must-see.</p>

<h3>A Ying Rewrites "Sleepless City"</h3>
<p>"Sleepless City," written by A Ying, was previously performed by the Qingdao Theater Company at the New Light Theater, and the box office results were quite good. However, A Ying felt that there were many places in the script that still needed to be enriched and revised. Now, at the invitation of the Shanghai Insurance Industry Amateur Association's "Bao Lian" drama troupe, he has decided to rewrite it, preparing for the Bao Lian troupe to perform it in the Shanghai vocational industry's drama charity performance.</p>
<p>The Bao Lian troupe, because some members did not have time to rehearse in the evenings, withdrew from "The True Story of Ah Q" and planned to stage another play to participate in the charity performance. After selecting several scripts, they finally decided to perform "Sleepless City," and asked A Ying for his consent to rewrite it. The directing will also be the responsibility of A Ying, who will hire [someone] or perhaps Chen Xihe, or maybe he will do it himself. The script is currently being rushed, and it can be completed by the end of the month.</p>

<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The reason is that they all have a foundation in Peking Opera, and about 90 percent of the plays they know are Peking Opera. Studying three or five Kunqu operas is just a way to show off their broad knowledge. How can they compare to Mr. Xiyuan, who has studied no less than a hundred Kunqu operas, so of course his pronunciation is exceptionally accurate. Some people say: "Although Elder Pu is proficient in both Kunqu and Peking Opera, Kunqu is superior to Peking Opera." Whether this is true or not, I dare not say, because I have rarely seen Mr. Pu perform. Now, the old actors in the Pear Garden are almost gone. The old masters are no longer to be seen. Mr. Xiyuan is not only a precious treasure, but also a unique mentor for both insiders and outsiders. Because he knows so much and is proficient in so much, and he is capable in both civil and martial roles in Kunqu and Peking Opera. If you really want to work hard to study opera in order to succeed in the future, who else can you ask for guidance if you abandon this good mentor?</p>
<p>Film Companies Should Invite Shang Heyu to Make a Film</p>
<p>Before the July 7th Incident, the Central Cultural Association had a proposal to invite the martial arts master Yang Xiaolou to make a film. The proposal was unanimously approved. If the war had not broken out, the Central Film Studio would have sent people north to contact Yang and implement the plan. The reason for the proposal was that the domestic costume dramas have been praised by Chinese and foreign audiences in recent years. At the same time, Yang's long-robe plays, such as "Changban Slope," "Farewell My Concubine," "Picking the Carriage," and "Iron Dragon Mountain," are all works that represent the ancient Chinese heroes and generals. After filming, they can not only be kept as models for future students, but also be transported to foreign countries and Southeast Asia for screening, so that foreign ladies can also learn about Chinese drama art on the screen. As for the demeanor of the ancient Chinese generals, only Yang Xiaolou can perform it well enough to express it. Unfortunately, this plan was not realized, and Yang has already passed away, which is a great regret. Fortunately, Mr. Shang Heyu, who is on par with Yang, is still alive. In terms of his art, apart from his voice and appearance being slightly inferior to Xiaolou, his martial arts skills are likely to be more skillful and refined than Yang's. Although he is older, he has no vices, so he is getting stronger in his old age. —— (Forty-nine) ——</p>

<h3>Completion of Renji Hospital</h3>
<p>Renji Hospital has been rebuilt on its old site with a large compound that has been completed. This hospital is elaborately arranged, with a large hall downstairs, 39 feet long and 29 feet wide, to accommodate the many outsiders who come to seek treatment. There is a reception hall, a consultation room, a fire pit, and three wards, each with twelve beds, upstairs, altogether accommodating seventy patients. The rooms are tall and spacious, the walls are strong and thick, and the orientation is south-facing, warm in winter and cool in summer, which is much better than Chinese houses. The construction cost a total of 5,500 taels of silver, which was raised from Chinese and Western merchants. By the end of last year, 4,597 taels of silver had been donated. After including the costs of purchasing equipment, there is still a shortage of 2,000 taels of silver. The list will be presented to Western benefactors, as well as Chinese benefactors, such as Supervisor Shen and Mr. Feng, the director of the Shanghai Manufacturing Bureau, silver firms, and silk and tea guilds, each of whom will receive a copy. Dr. Joanneson, the Western doctor in the hospital, contributed the most to this project, and his earnest efforts helped to make this great undertaking a success, which is admirable! Dr. Joanneson does not take credit for his success, but praises his Chinese physician, Chunfu, saying that he is skilled in Western medicine, does not refuse hard work, and has greatly assisted in the hospital's affairs.</p>
<h3>New Western Theater</h3>
<p>A new theater built by Westerners is located on Macau Road, not far from Suzhou Creek, and is now completed. This theater is larger than both the Jinkui and Dangkui theaters, and is very clean. It has two floors of seating, and the chairs are comfortable. Behind the stage, the area is large, and under the stage is the place for the musicians. In Western theaters, no one is seen on stage except the actors. And there are several screens on the stage to block the back of the stage, so when acting, whether a house or a street scene, it is made by pulling the screens with ropes, and the scene is like a painting. The new theater is complete and well-equipped, which is pleasing to the eye.</p>
