<h3>法幣本相與前途之認識</h3>
<p>觀輓近上海人心，富有之家，惟虞日用物品之來源不繼，中人以决，惟虞凡百貨價之繼漲增高，絕大多數心理若此。而若干喪心病在者，或處心積慮惟謀資金逃避，或居積商貨惟求善價而沽，或掀風作浪惟事投機操縱。上海誠有其不安之根本因素，然一般社會之不安，固由心理造成之也。心理不安，映射而為黑滙市塲之動盪；黑滙動盪，復增進社會心理之不安；因果如環，初非事實之本相，然無定識定力者，遂如盲人瞎馬而為之目眩心悸矣。</p>
<p>夫上海黑滙市塲之行市，能代表法幣之眞價値乎？即投機者亦知其不然，蓋法幣自有其價値在，上海人之所見，僅在黑滙，僅在上海一隅之表面。彼極端利己主義者，以為惟購買黃金外幣，方可策財產之安全，獨不念今日黃金外幣之似乎貴，非以法幣計算其價値之故乎。如果法幣喪其為計算之標準，則所擁有之黃金外幣，勢必另以貨幣計算，此其為貴為賤，為益為損，雖有巧計，亦不能預卜之也。吾人應知幣本無値，人寄以値，値之高昂，基於供求，生於信任，信任而專，金紙何擇。不予信任，未見黃金能療飢渴也。法幣自有眞價値，然則追隨黑市而蹂躪法幣，徒為投機者造機會，不其傎歟！</p>
<p>雖然，此决黑滙在縮，獲益亦有可得而言者：進口貨價之昂貴，使大衆生活，不期而自趨於節的，一也；因進口貨自然减縮之結果，而使淪陷之關稅收入，大為减少，二也；復因用以納稅之關金，仍根據法定滙率計算，而彼以此換算為黑滙，無形中使稅收打一大折扣，三也；滙價高昂，外貨自貴，使彼壟斷之工商貨品，成本加重，不易傾銷，四也；减少其套買外滙之數量與利益，五也。所惜黑滙市塲一日不停止，則其套取外滙一日不能杜絕；黑滙期貨買賣長此不變，則投機套利之徒因緣為利；黃金外幣追求無止境，則法幣之値亦動搖不定；故今日之黑滙市塲，徒亂人意，而妨礙正常工商業，此本報所以歷决主張根本改革也。</p>
<p>要知「中國有無窮盡之寳藏與資源，故法幣實有無窮盡之準備與信用。」上海黑滙市塲所見之法幣價値，乃為視程所生之幻影，而非法幣之眞値本相。故若自墮法幣之信用，則乘問蹈隙而入者，並法幣之不如；熟權利害，屛息靜思，用法幣作孤注者，亦可廢然思返矣。彼不安於法幣而競向黑市討生活者，固無損於法幣之眞價，徒自損其持有之資產，固彰彰明甚；即以法幣現象而論，亦決不永為黑市所貶，蓋操縱之力量有限，而實際之運用無窮。黑市之暴縮，影響上海一隅者最烈，其决亦即損及各國之對華貿易。各國為保全其權益計，維持此市塲計，終不坐視法幣之竟厄於黑市。例如日前英國增信用放款額五十萬鎊為三百萬鎊，美國又收購中國白銀五百萬美金，蘇聯由中蘇商的成立而許予信用放款允鉅，此外，適用物物交換方法者，範圍正在推擴之中；凡此種種，皆中國抗戰時期充實經濟力量之法門，問接加强法幣之基礎；大勢若斯，則法幣之欣欣向榮，自有其確鑿之因素在焉。動盪之黑市，盲目之心理，固決不能久於盲目動盪也。</p>
<h3>英美決定切實合作　穩定中國法幣　英提高對華信用放款　充實平準基金商討中</h3>
<p>倫敦此問各觀察家咸謂、英美兩國均已決定賡續支持中國法幣、中國財政部决長徐堪正在香港、會同中國銀行家與外國銀行家相接洽、經過情形極為機密、據聞英國各銀行準備添撥款項、用以充實匯兌平準基金、防止法幣繼續跌價、査法幣跌價原因、乃由中國購進大批外國貨物與各種原料品所致、茲英國旣允提高對華信用放款至三百萬鎊之數、自足以减輕法幣所受之壓力、至以美國而論、似不擬撥款加入平準基金、該國業以信用放款二千五百萬美元給予中國、又復陸續購進中國白銀、新近購入之數、的有五百萬美元之多、自於中國有所裨補、此間中國人并謂其他各國姑置不論、只須英美兩國有所盡力、卽足以保持法幣之穩定、一俟平準基金充實之後、自可應一切可能的操縱云、（十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓此間政府及財政界、昨晚對淤中國幣制情形，懸念殊深、彼等聲稱、美國對於目前中國幣制、究將採取何項行動、彼等一無所知、美國政府所能採取之唯一有效辦法、即為直接參加中國匯兌平準基金、但消息靈通方面人士聲稱、彼等獲悉未嘗在此間或在巴黎徵求美法兩國參加此事之舉云、（十八日美聯社電）</p>
<p>倫敦哈瓦斯社訪員頃探悉、英國業與中國簽訂協定、允將商務信用放款、自五寸萬鎊加至三百萬鎊、俾中國用以向英國購買運輸工具與共他各種貨物、據消息靈通人士所知，此項信用放款一部份業由中國動用、租賃輪船以便裝載所購貨物、經由仰光港運入中國、此問政界人士聞訊之餘、咸表歡迎、並謂値茲日本政府正謀攫取天津存銀之際、英國政府乃有此項決定、可為欣慰、（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦據今日此間消息、關於英國對華輪出放款三百萬鎊一事、雖談判巳吿就緖、惟尙有若干技術問題、猶未商決、故尙未正式簽字、聞此項放款、利息為五厘、分十四年歸還、由英格蘭銀行發行債券、及各私人銀行承銷、（十八日美聯電）</p>

<h3>是否囤積米糧　各銀行自請澈查　停市期內盼勿乘機脫售　訂購洋米說尙未能證實</h3>
<p>本市米價、自有暗盤以後、即無軌道可循、價格高漲、民不聊生、當局雖深籌熟慮、一時尙未有確定辦法、外傳雖有訂購洋米、及辦理平糶之說、但多係未證實之消息、茲分誌如後、</p>
<p>購辦洋米　並未證實</p>
<p>米業方盛稱工部局訂洋米十萬包、第一批為一萬八千包，但此說並未認為定案、工部局對民食問題、籌劃已久、糧食委員會雖有無法疏通來源、祗有訂購洋米之議論、但並未經董事會正式通過、即使運抵上海、辦理平糶、亦如杯水車薪、此各方所以盼工部局有確切之救濟辦法公布全巿者也、昨有人稱、所謂一萬八千包洋米、僅內中一小部分、由虞洽卿氏以私人名義採辦、備為救濟貧民之需、似較為可靠、</p>
<p>市塲停業　乘機整理</p>
<p>上海豆米行業公會巿塲管理委員會、昨晨在市塲公吿、「因市况超越限價、暗盤紊亂、茲經巿塲管理委員會議決、即日起暫行停巿兩天、二十一日（星期一）仍照常營業、」擬乘休假期內、乘機將市塲情形、予以整理、該會復於昨晨上午十時、在北巿辦事處召集四十二决委員會議、議決自廿一日起市塲營業、均須切實登記、貨主及承銷號、當詳記之、俾運銷符合、便於呈報</p>
<p>請求再予　澈查存米</p>
<p>本埠各堆棧存米確數前曾由工部局糧食管理委員會調査發表、惟連日市上流言紛起、有疑銀行囤積者、現本埠各銀行特函請工部局糧食管理委會再予一次詳細調查、而正式公布、以明眞相、據又一消息、調査存米一事、手續極煩、非灼知囤積內容者、不易辦到、各銀行請求詳查、亦屬現狀下應有之事、殊屬正當、但望囤戶一切公開、市民儘可原諒、而最宜注意者、在米業停市之三天內、有無大戶將米乘機脫手、分散出售、圖以最高價了結卸除責任之企圖、此則不可不注意者、記者極望全市民和衷共濟、互維生活、自二十一日米市重開之日起、米價迅速恢復原限價、則一般人猶有喘息之餘地也、</p>
<p>暗抬米價　被處罰金</p>
<p>前天辣斐德路附近某米舖、來一顧客、購米四石、暗中言明每石三十元、但某祗帶國幣五十元、計差七十元、因囑開發票一紙、連同食米、送到某家、隨將餘款帶轉、但店夥向某言明、發票上祗能開每石廿元、四石共計八十元、當收五十元字據、否則未便、某唯唯、待米送到其家、某找以國幣三十元、（照發票開價）、店夥不允、定須七十元、由是雙方爭執、某即持發票扭往對質、結果以該店暗抬米價、罰國幣五十元了事、望貪利而不顧民食者其鑒諸、</p>
<p>貧民飢不　擇食可慮</p>
<p>公菜租界梅白格路新閘路北沿河一帶、多江北貧民、近來該處有某米店、因巳糶空、店夥等皆袖手觀望、另一米店、緣資木充足、所售白米、皆買進之糙粳自碾、該貧民因恐無米可糴、爭向該米店購買黃糙米、每石廿四元、且至多每人五斗、不許多買、自晨至暮、戶限為穿云、</p>
<h3>中英借款成功　金融市塲趨穩　新貨幣已證實無稽　外滙轉鬆證劵回漲</h3>
<p>上海金融巿塲、前因謠傳新貨幣發行、以致投機者作祟、外匯黑巿暴縮、黃金飛漲、公債回跌、貼水高漲、今發行新貨幣之說、經財政部說明無稽、同時中國向英國之商務信用借款、三百萬鎊成功、協的已簽訂、於是金融巿塲、為之一振、並轉趨穩定、新聲社記者昨向巿塲探悉、（一）外匯黑市、英商匯豐銀行掛牌、依然不動、實際行市、已轉鬆趨穩、（二）黃金暗市、巳趨穩定、上下不若過去之鉅、上午收盤為四千五百七十元、下午收盤為四千五百六十元、（三）證券暗市、統一甲種漲六角、乙種漲八角、丙種漲七角、丁種漲四角半、戊種漲五角、（四）匯劃貼水微降、的在一百九十元至一百九十五元之間、</p>
<h3>中央銀行滬分行　點收新輔幣券　發行及支配權由該行專辦　不再交由烟兌兩公會支配</h3>
<p>代幣郵票繳回極困難</p>
<p>中央銀行滬分行現運到之新輔幣券、業經點騐完竣、刻正擬各業領換限額辦法、一俟決定、即於下週正式發行、流市面、至於郵票問題善後辦法有待籌商、各情如决，</p>
<p>新到分券　點騐竣事</p>
<p>該行前因滬埠銅輔幣缺乏、曾呈准重慶　總行、以法幣五十萬元之十足準備、擬發行一分五分新輔幣券五十萬元、經香港美商永寗公司承印完竣、業於前日中午、全數運滬、據悉該新券係由永寗滬公司負責交點淸楚、共分裝一百餘箱、前昨兩日該行已派員施行複點手續、交由國庫局保管、大致下週一二、可交由發行局遵照指示辦法、正式公吿、妥愼發行、</p>
<p>中央滬行　專司發行</p>
<p>該行前於發行鎳銅輔幣時、為澈底調劑平均分配起見、曾准巿商會轉錢兌烟兌兩業公會之請、將該兩種新幣、酌予交由該兩公會支配掉換、流通市面、今該行以滬市情形特殊、對於此决新券之發行及支配權、擬决定專司其事、將來於必要時、再行准由各業領換、叉聞錢兌·烟兌·兩業得悉此券到滬發行期近、即擬派員向商會及該行接洽、請仍沿以前領換辦法、領換新發行之新券、</p>
<p>擬訂領換　限額辦法</p>
<p>滬地銅輔幣缺乏原因、各界因早洞悉、所幸各業應付得法、隨以郵票及代價券補救零數、週轉困難、該行於新券未發行前、已積極起草各界領換此新券限額辦法、視各業各自應有之需要、予以極週詳之便利、譬如有超越反常領換之鉅數、當予考慮或逕予拒絕、査此項措置、純係愼防今後奸人不良之企圖、預計俟此限額辦法訂定後、隨時可定期正式發行云云、</p>
<p>電汽車劵　應即收回</p>
<p>據金融界方面探悉、本埠公共租界及法租界電車及公共汽車公司，於輔幣缺乏時、會印製各種代價券及銅鋁等輔幣、以便找淸各乘客之買票尾數、但所找之券幣、僅能於電車汽車上使用、對於一般平民方面、頗多不便、今中行旣有新券到滬、該兩公司應即將以前所發之券幣如數收回、俾幣制方面、臻於一致、關於南京路各大公司之代價券、聞巳早經收回、靜待中行新券流通市面、</p>
<p>郵票問題　善後有待</p>
<p>中行新券旣已軍滬發行期近、對於四十萬元郵票收回問題、郵局方面發言人云、各業購用四十萬郵票、原係自動調劑業務上需要、一經往返使用、不無染有汚蹟、或有奸人利用肥皂水洗淸用過舊郵票、紛起混用、郵局方面根本無收回之可能、又據滬郵局乍配林氏左右談稱、市面購用之郵票、按照郵局定章、殊難收回、但如有淸潔無汚之郵票、於寄信時可准照常使用云云、惟該項辦法、影響平民甚鉅、切望有關團體向郵局方面籌商解决、以恤民艱、</p>

<p>哈瓦斯社十七日倫敦電　關於天津四華籍嫌疑犯問題、耶路撒冷大學敎授邊德威·英國廣播公司董事費萊女士·日前耍求上海英國領事法庭援引人身保護法、但遭駁斥不准、頃有此間艾爾威與平福律師事務所、接受邊德威敎授·費萊女士·曁英國援華運動委員會主席李斯多威勛爵之委託、向此間法庭提出同樣請求、法官凱塞爾斯當即准予受理、定於下星期四日（八月二十四日）聆取律師方面之意見、屆時　果核准此項請求、即常咨行外務大臣、轉飭天津總領事·工部局總董·與典獄官、着其將各該嫌疑犯、解至英國法庭受審、或即予以釋放、</p>

<p>路透社十七日倫敦電、最高法院法官凱塞爾斯、今日在其辦公室對代表現遭天津英租界覊禁之華籍四嫌疑犯所提出之片面的呈請聽訟後、巳准發保護人身法令狀之傳達書、該令狀可於星期二日發表、而送達外相哈立法克斯勳爵·駐天津英總領事詹姆森·天津英租界工部局總董鐵伯·及天津英監獄獄吏、</p>
<p>上海方面　另提呈請</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、關於天津英租界所扣四華籍嫌疑犯案件、倫敦方面已有艾爾惠與平福律師事務所向法院提出保護人身法令狀之呈請、此與上海所提呈請完全相同、上海方面之呈請、昨日（十七日）已遭英國駐華按察使署推事瓊思在辦公室中駁回、但駁回並非不能復提呈請之謂、事實上本埠愛理思律師公館刻正向英按察使莫肅爵士另提保護人身法令狀之呈請、</p>
<p>即在深夜　亦可請求</p>
<p>據語者稱、人民之在危險中、即可隨時隨地向任何推事呈請此令狀、例如他人向推事瓊思另提呈請、無可阻其不提者、律師且可在深夜二時請推事起床呈請令狀、而不受阻碍云、倫敦發出傳達書、其意義為接得傳達書之四人、須於星期二日提出保護人身法令狀何以不適用於彼等之理由、倫敦因法院休假、故在辦公室中聽訟、向例每年委休假法官一人、以處理緊急呈請、故本年度似由法官凱塞爾斯任休假法官之職、</p>

<p>大量軍器</p>
<p>軍火、事前會嚴令不得破壞官昌四週之第三國產業、是日轟炸兩决、首决轟炸亞細亞火油棧東南偏東之軍火與軍器、遇宜昌近郊發出之猛烈高射砲火、若干飛機受砲彈爆裂之震蕩、而飛機機身為彈片貫穿、惟據飛機隊指揮官、及隨同觀察之參謀軍官報吿、顯無炸彈墜於亞細亞公司油棧、或擊中</p>
<p>第三國輪</p>
<p>船、但該油棧東南角所泊輪船附近、墜下三彈、故輪員有為彈片所傷之可能、第二次轟炸、指揮官與參謀軍官未見有何炸彈擊中第三國產業、亦有見停泊之船隻被炸起火、若果英輪焚燬、諒在其他待間、且因他故所致、如有炸彈墜於亞細亞火油公司或使</p>
<p>英籍輪員</p>
<p>受傷、實屬遺憾、苟有其事，則係華方軍事建築都近英國產業之故、此等不幸事件、必屬不可避免者、若謂英輪因轟炸結果而起火、則請向日軍當局提出證據、</p>

<h3>金融　現金局勢稍稍澄清</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗槃市况、因外滙變動轉小、現金巿混亂局面、亦逐漸泯滅、當日高低差度、巳不滿百元、若此後外滙趨定、不久定可恢復常軌、初時因外滙報硬、且報載英國業將經濟援華、致賣風頗盛、允以某金號力代投機商出籠、晨開即退達四千五百三十元、後叉續降低至四千五百十元、十時許聞外匯趨勢轉軟、一時售者觀望、加以香港帮委託塲中流動之掮客、四起搜購、兼外行亦有吃胃、故市勢轉堅、立飛漲至四千五百九十元高峯、嗣後某金號賣意復萌、且銀樓帮亦來頻塞、再以外匯趨穩、致漲勢頓挫、午後一度又撳低至四千五百二十元、入後因散戶趁低價時吸胃尙佳、遂回高至四千五百六十元收盤、結果較上日軋跌五元、交易尙旺、的千兩有餘、銀樓飾金先漲後回、終無榮辱、海關金與中英純金等仍均無變動、</p>
<p>洪帮搜買一度激漲</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開、因聞外滙帶硬、買者寥寥、銀樓帮與錢兌業均來塞出、致開市即撳小三十五元、銀樓帮賣予錢兌業二十兩、價四千五百三十元、嗣證券帮進金號三十兩、價抬高十元為四千五百四十元、此後賣方因聞外匯續硬、故復來拋塞、不久又步落三十元、錢兌業互做十兩、價四千五百十元、十時二十分、聞外匯因日行扒吸、潛勢轉緊、故激動買風、某余號與證券帮等競相吸收、兼某錢兌業亦頻來購買、是以情勢反動向上、未幾即漲起七十元、銀樓帮互做五十兩價四千五百四十元、後一度回小至四千五百六十五元、但不旋踵某銀號及錢兌業復來收買、遂再飛升二十五元、錢兌業進現金號二十兩、價四千五百九十元、後聞外匯趨穩、賣風叉起、錢兌業與證券帮均反進為出、立回降三十五元、錢兌業吐予某金號三十兩、價四千五百五十五元、將近午刻、復銷向上、證券帮進現金號十兩、為四千五百七十元作午收價、午後初開、某金號續來出籠、且外滙極穩、致開巿即做小二十元、某金號賣予錢兌業二十兩、價四千五百五十元、後因銀樓帮亦來塞出、加以進者觀望、故價又疲落三十元、錢兌業互做二十兩、價四千五百二十元、時某銀號代外行力吸、兼散戶亦來復進、故價又轉上漲、不久即飛躍五十元、錢兌業進某　號三十兩、價四千五百七十元、入後某金號又塞錢兌業三十兩、為四千五百六十元、作晚收價、結果比上日軋跌五元、聞收後、錢兌業進銀樓帮與現金號共五十兩、價四千五百六十五兀、全天八十元差度、現金號之本牌金照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛脾金低六十五元、均鮮做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金未有榮辱</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出、初時大同行仍懸四百六十元、迨至十一時十五分掛高五元、下午二時二十分、回落五元、結果無榮辱、大同行仍懸原價四百六十元、新同行為四百五十八元、收進的减小二十元光景、</p>
<p>中英純金仍無變動</p>
<p>十七日倫敦電、英純金每盎斯仍為七鎊八先令七便士、致中央銀行之各行市價、仍均呆而不動、</p>
<h3>外匯平庸</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市況、匯豐掛牌揭曉、仍無上落、英美匯暗巿情勢殊穩、起伏亦轉狹小、盤旋於隔昨晚收價之上、初時因華商棉紗帮曁其他投機家等頻來拋塞現期英美滙、故情况穩中帶硬、但其時滙鹽稍有吃胃、十時許日行正金突趁賤扒結、市象轉軟、午刻日行已止扒觀望、為狀更平、午後趨勢愈形平庸、但西商沙遜則曾來稍扒九月期貨美匯、結果現貨以英金三辦士四三七五、美滙六元六八七五收盤、而八九月期貨亦趨同一步驟、終則英微長〇三一二五、美略硬〇六二五、全天交易因經營者多數觀望、甚形平淡、</p>
<p>棉紗帮塞日行進</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均縮〇六二五、紐約銀價未更、倫敦生金仍平、滙兌英對美對法均平、對滬小二五、美對英法俱平、對滬跌一角五分、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨一賣價、英金三辦士四〇六五、美匯六元六二五、較之前收、均無榮辱、開後首由洋行結進某行現貨美滙六元六二五、後華商吐予外行現貨英金三辦士四三七五、迨滙豐掛牌揭曉、悉無上落、及白銀平衡稅揭曉、依然免徵、此後棉紗帮賣予滙豐現貨英金三辦士四六八七五、繼又售予某行現貨美滙六元六八七五及七五、時某行又吸納華商本月份美滙六元五六二五、及本月份英金三辦士四〇六二五、是以過程穩中帶硬、十時二十分日行突來扒進外行現貨美滙六元六八七五、並九月份美匯五元七五、故為狀回平、時外行賣價英金祗三辦士西〇六二五、美滙僅六元六二五、將近午刻、外行賣意似稍轉濃、延至午收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三辨士四三七五、美滙六元六八七五、</p>
<p>結果期現均微鬆</p>
<p>後市為狀呆滯、初時投機商賣予外行現貨英金三辦士六八七五、入後西商沙遜突來吸進外行九月份美滙五元八七五、延至晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金三辦士四三七五、美滙六元六八七五、本月份英金三辦士三七五、美滙六元五六二五、九月份英金三辦士、美滙五元八一二五、結果比上日英金現期均微長〇三一二五、美滙俱略硬〇六二五、</p>
<p>香港匯市變動小</p>
<p>香港十八日電、今日滙巿開盤平穩、英美日各滙無變動、申滙降二元、為四百二十三元、九時五十五分、申滙降六元、為四百十七元、十時五十分、申滙回升八元、為西百二十五元、十一時三十分及下午二時三十分開盤、市面平靜、行情均無榮辱、全日申滙比升二元、</p>

<h3>貼現回挫</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率，反動回低、每千元初仍二百元、繼稍下低、午刻為一百九十七元、下午更不支、續低至最後為一百九十二元半、比前日回跌七元五角、錢業公會拆息、早午兩市均掛一角八分、</p>
<h3>金鎊堅挺　美金元升三元</h3>
<p>昨外幣英美金鎊、供給不暢、市况堅挺、允以美金鎊為最俏、英美金票、供求甚盛、惟以外匯趨鬆關係、市况稍軟、香港票法郞票、供求較稀、巿况穩定、新加坡票荷蘭票、流通稀少、市價微昂、安南票頗多供塞、市况回鬆、日金票需要較衰、巿况稍軟、晚市為一元一角七分五厘、朝鮮票供給見殷、市價略降、晚市為九角八分五厘、其他各幣、頗呈穩定、未有更動、公會交易未盛、恒茂出長泰進美金票五百元、勤泰出長泰進美金鎊五十個、仁泰出永泰進香港票一千元、昨日市價、英金鎊升一元、英金票降八角、美金鎊鎊升三元、美金票降二角四分、新加坡票升五分、荷蘭票升一角、安南票降二角、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>證券　內債稍漲　外股轉疲</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況趨勞忽轉、人氣似較興奮、惟形勢茶覺無力、根脚仍覺不堅、因祇補空而無新多、其轉漲原因、謂為中英借款之成立、實際其漲因仍為檯面補空所致、傳言金子帮略有買進、恐非事實、散戶臨時做多、事或有之、浮空抵補、始將行巿稍稍抬高、故開盤即好起半元、樂茂鼎康以及聯和等均有進胃、惟鴻康及大康兩家始終賣出、漲風乃為之一挫、結果回好四角半至八角不等、成交總數的有四五十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交國華銀行股五十股、價為三十九元二角五分、</p>
<p>衆業公所報告、外滙趨鬆、世界各處所傳消息、紛歧欠穩、為昨日股市趨跌之有力因素、各股甚少有能維持其前日所漲之價而不動搖、即橡皮巿、亦吿不支、交易圾普遍者、為英爪華股至二十八元二角半與七角牟之價、頗有做開、市况趨軟現象、在實業股中、以公共汽車與電車股為甚、前者所成交為二十元之新低價、債券中以電力公債為較顯著、其成交價仍係七十三元、收盤時於同價下有賣戶、</p>
<p>本埠怡和洋行經理英商公和祥碼頭有限公司、昨經董事會議決、定於八月三十日起、開派一九三九年份中期股息、每股國幣十元、股票過戶、亦自八月二十三日起至三十日止、暫停辦理、</p>
<p>倫教英商速東各公司股票本月十七日（週四）掛牌行市、滙豐銀行股稍見跌落計英倫註冊股降半鎊、為七十二鎊半、香港註冊股降一鎊、為七十五鎊、其餘均無變動、</p>
<p>倫敦中國外債本月十七日（週四）掛牌行市上下檔各種公債仍吿平穩無變動、</p>
<h3>紗花　港帮獨辦廿支雙馬　現貨被其搜羅一盡　高價再見七七三元</h3>
<p>紗市漲風復熾、蓋實需發展、華南港滇兩帮、對於粗細紗採辦允殷、以致人心活潑、査港帮對於二十支雙馬進胃獨健、且有來者不拒之慨、市上所有現貨、被其搜羅一盡、於是買價愈高、漲力獨强、其他牌子受銷路落後、仍在穩中帶軟之境、二十支雙馬高價迭出、再見七百七十三元之新紀錄、照此情况、二十支雙地球及天女相形、較為便宜矣、</p>
<p>現紗晨開、因客帮銷場發展、滇港兩帮皆有辦胃、巿象又緊，開盤即漲五元，二十支雙馬價為七百五十七元、廠單價為六百九十五元、少頃聞廣帮專買雙馬、人心又振、呌價步步提高、最好價為七百七十三元、比開價漲十六元、但其他無大去路、較為和緩、收盤平平、查半日成交、各帮買去統計一千四百〇五包、十九日有紗六十件運香港、十件運西貢、二十七件運暹羅、行情二十支雙馬好二十一元、特金城漲五元、牧羊漲七元、廠方無動靜、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、</p>
<p>香港　六七五　同行　一七五</p>
<p>內地　一二五　雲南　四一〇</p>
<p>汕頭　二〇　統計一、四〇五</p>
<h3>有擬提高棉價　同業售意棉價　同業售意淡薄</h3>
<p>中外棉花交易、轉趨然鬧、昨成交仍以印美棉居多、申新廠進美棉米特林三百件、價二百元至二百零八元、（現鈔送廠）、鴻章廠進粗紗原料一百件、日廠進胃略展、其餘同業貿賣允繁、以致售價堅定、蘇北未見到貨、茲將現棉售盤錄左、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、市上盛傳下月起、海關稅收均將增加、况日來滙兌未能放長、現貨存底微薄、各同業售棉之意、殊為淡薄、因之交易較靜、然據某方盛傳、對於滬埠之現貨價格擬將加以提高、俾使同業能向洋行方面訂購定貨、藉此則可將滬上棉額、得以調劑也、蓋因某方以經濟枯凋、自身實無力定購也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約開盤即呈堅定之象、因棉區氣候報吿惡劣，且棉收悄形不佳、中途投機者套買、收盤較上日尙漲叫五磅音、印度連同預測不動、埃及棉價漲六七磅音、</p>
<h3>疋頭　同業交易大盛　一面應付實銷　一面補囤額</h3>
<p>國布</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>小事</h3>
<p>— 消人</p>
<p>從前有一位學者講錯了典故，被人指摘出來了，他便說：「那不過是小事！」</p>
<p>眞的，講錯一個典故，怎麼不是「小事」呢？奇怪的是竟有人注意那樣的小事，而允其奇怪的是連那樣的小事也竟會弄錯。</p>
<p>我就是愛注意那樣的小事的一個人。為了這層，常使注意大事的大人物看得煩躁，恨不得把我擠出文化圈子去。然而老脾氣改不掉，在沒有被擠出以前，總還是愛注意小事。</p>
<p>在文壇上會經流行過一句譁過來的洋話：「舊瓶不能裝新酒」。文士們為了這句話，曾經爭論過，大家都想說通「舊瓶」和「新酒」衝突的道理。到最近，「自由談」底編者纔說明了原文並不是「瓶」而是「皮袋」，文士們實在是白費了一番氣力。自然，這是小事，但這小事却也費了文士們底一些小氣力了。</p>
<p>然而這實在由於大家眞的不明白，却總還沒有騙人的意思。可是像下面的兩件事，就未免多少有些「自欺欺人」的嫌疑。</p>
<p>第一件，已經相當的久了。不知道誰弄了幾盆曇華到上海來，登了廣吿，要人買票去見識。於是有博物家出來做文章了，說那花上海從來沒有過，而特別應該見識的是：那便是佛經上所說的曇華。花的照像在一種畫報上印出來了，不錯，確是曇華。那花種在上海沒有來過，也或者是事實，但有一種西洋種，上海却是有的。而且佛家底曇華，是根據「法華經」上的話來的，但那說的却實在是優曇缽花，說明白一點，便是無花果，和這個草本的曇華却簡直不相干。自然，這是小事，但為甚麼在這小事上也要騙人呢？</p>
<p>第二件，也巳經相當的久了。依然是一位博物家發的議論，——是給中國舊書上所說的馬櫻花做的一篇攷據。博物家說：馬櫻花便是日本底櫻花，古詩中的那首「門前一樹馬櫻花」的情詩，便表明櫻花在中國古時也是和「冷遊」有關係的。這說得似乎是好聽，但可惜却是胡說。日本底櫻花雖然出名，但我們却無須爭這體面。櫻花其實只是櫻（Prunus　PseudoCerasus）底變種，到頭還是屬於薔薇科的植物。馬櫻花却屬於荳科，學名呌作合歡（Albizzia　jullbrissin）牠所以能得這個名字，大槪因爲葉子到夜即合的緣故。把這樹放在情詩中，那纔算是適當了。自然，這是小事</p>
<p>但這都隨牠去好了。因爲這兩件事，實在是專門了一點，雖然瞎扯的倒不妨是專家。可是最近我却在文士們底文章中發見了兩條小事。</p>
<p>一條是關於中國古人吳梅村的。那位作家說吳梅村是：「晚年降淸，終其身居京中作淸廷底重臣，許多文字獄都出於他底計劃。」這眞不知道是那裏得來的消息。吳梅村底「降淸」是千眞萬眞的，這不但他自己在詩文中悔恨得不得了，而且還被淸廷把名字寫到了「貳臣傅」裏面。但他却並沒有作「重臣」，「終其身」也只在家鄉吃老米飯，——自然，官俸是有的。至於文字獄的「計劃」却還輪不到他。他是該駡的，但也不必硬把他拉到淸朝皇帝底身旁，呌他良心喪盡。</p>
<p>一條是關於外國今人鄧南遮的。那位作家說鄧南遮雖是愛國者，實在無賴，說他現在「說不定正在造作詩句打算恭維墨索里尼向法國討還殖民地的事業」。說鄧南遮是無賴，一點也不錯的，但他現在却實在不見得會「造作詩句」。因為：他在去年春天便已經死掉了。他生前是該駡的，倘是還活着，我相信是可以做這樣的事，但我却不相信他會從墓中爬出來去「恭維墨索里尼」。</p>
<p>說來說去，都是小事。但目前言路是這樣的窄，好在還沒有被擠出文化圈子，就來說一說也不要緊。</p>
<h3>影子</h3>
<p>— 黃肅秋</p>
<p>一切天神皆已死，</p>
<p>如今我們希望超人長生。</p>
<p>——尼采蘇魯友語錄</p>
<p>凝起無數層灰黑的雲朶，看徵候，天又要下雨了！</p>
<p>窗外的空氣，流動着遠處硝烟的臭味。雷不再怒吼了，道死一般的闃靜，正昭示了暴風雨前夜的嚴肅。</p>
<p>『打開窗子吧，放一點新的空氣進來。」</p>
<p>當想到這普希金的名句時、，我意識地啟開窗子，然後將眼掃在那羣如火燄似的年靑人身上，在這麽多流動的行列中，我發覺了一個孩子沒有來。</p>
<p>立刻，一個細長的影子在我面前幌動，嚴肅的臉上，那兩隻剛毅的眼睛，似乎在逼視我，漸漸地向我發出一串串的問題。從她有點嘎喑的聲音中我知道她在過分焦急的等待着答覆。我却為她的堅强逼得消息了。找想，我該說得多些，關於人與魔鬼之戰——在這血與血交流，肉與肉相迸的塲合，應該開放賦有的喉嚨。</p>
<p>於是我開始說了：</p>
<p>『鐵的意志應該表現鐵的行動中，在目前這民族抗爭的時代中，只有奮鬥才能談到生存，只有流血才能獲得自由。……』</p>
<p>跟着來的是沉默，那孩子的臉上開始浮上憂鬱，一種過分的衝突煎熬着她的意志，她不再將笑容描在臉上。</p>
<p>這以後，她也從不把問題噙在口裏。常見她獨自一個人沉默在一隅的書本裹，有時也和三兩個談得來的入馳逐在校園路上。她的眉常為心緖擰成千百結，然而也常在思想裏蕩出一層欣慰。沒有笑，她的高興織在明快的興奮中；而這內心的隱秘，常為像她這樣靑年所保藏着的。</p>
<p>從此，時間携着發芽的思想邁進，由春徂夏，那孩子開始成熟了她的夢想。聽說大考沒完的時候，她便跨入另一個生活的血海裏，想像着她的血會洗去新中國的恥辱，想像着她健全的雄姿會勇壯踏在抗爭的浪潮前。——為立地起來的祖國，祝福那孩子的健康吧！</p>
<p>然而窗外正凝着雨，灰黑的雲朶，壓得人透不過氣來。入夜的時候，四周潛伏着猛獸和屠夫。期待着天明吧，我們渴慕着暴風雨的照臨。</p>

<h3>伙夫班長　（下）</h3>
<p>— 矞華</p>
<p>他還當過六年的戰鬥兵，那是在北伐前後的幾年，他是個長年手提機槍的射擊手，後來因為目力减退，還是幹伙夫。後來在「一二八」上海那回戰爭中間，他又意外地打了一仗，那是他在八十七師王敬久將軍統率，他在正接戰的得很激烈的火綫上，他眼見前面的一班同志死多了，機槍手也實在受了傷，發在似的日軍正躲在裝甲車後面在衝過來，於是班長發急了，奔到機槍旁邊，架起來就打，日軍迫得倉皇地敗退下去，這回他認為倒是生來打仗空前痛快的一决。這一回抗戰以來，勇敢的卜班長可還沒有再顯身手的機會。</p>
<p>卜班長累積多年的經騐，燒菜煮飯委實到了最純熟的程度，他能憑着水汽知道飯的生熟，而且燒多少米飯，他可以估計得出正確的時間，他手裏最多燒過四千人吃的飯。</p>
<p>這回長沙十一月十二日大火，兪濟時將軍派卜班長領着十九人到難民收容所煮飯，所里一千七百多難民的飯和菜每天總共要十二担米，一千二百斤菜，二百斤猪肉，他們用了十付行軍鍋逵，每餐需燒十二鍋菜，二十五鍋飯，分作五批開飯，所以早飯開過，接着就開夜飯，每天要煮那麽多的飯和菜，班長和十九個同志半夜兩點鍊就得起身，直到晚上十點鐘才睡，整天在繁忙中。班長一個月來，他沒有呌過苦；他說小時家境困苦，挨餓時很多，這痛苦他是知道的，他很樂意地給難民們燒呢。</p>
<p>不單是燒飯菜，他還給千多難民燒洗臉水，自己却給煤烟熏得滿面黑灰。</p>
<p>「卜老板，』人家指着他的臉說：『你黑得像印度人了，幹麼不洗個臉啦，軍團長來參觀像什麼樣子！』</p>
<p>『哈哈，軍團長準不認識我了。』他用衣袖去抹了抹臉</p>
<p>『卜老板你要燒火災難民的飯，下次可再不能幹了。』長沙的弟兄警吿他。</p>
<p>『好吧，別開玩笑，下决也不能再來個大火了！』</p>
<p>這次新長沙報把勤勞的卜班長介紹一次說：「卜班長燒飯不多不少，不生不硬，委實能幹！」他見了報趕忙吾認說：『這可不是我一個人的功勞，全是同志們大家的事兒。」於是他把報紙唸給他的同伴聽去。</p>
<p>這些伙夫可眞辛勞呢，收容所的當局特地慰勞了他們一决，大吃一頓，還預備送他們一個紀念章。</p>
<h3>夜行船</h3>
<p>— 狂瘋</p>
<p>夕陽撤下紫銅色的網，</p>
<p>暮霧裏倒掛一鈎淡月；</p>
<p>夜行船蠕着沉重的步武，</p>
<p>浪花哮破了江水的靜穆。</p>
<p>拉呀前面快近急潮頭，</p>
<p>心跟船身轆轆地顚轉；</p>
<p>伸向黃昏去的一片路途，</p>
<p>滔滔地捲起萬里銀波。</p>
<p>夜輕輕溜過縴夫的脚，</p>
<p>生命的流跟江水上昇。</p>
<p>撇一身疲憊，翻下了山坡</p>
<p>逮處閃爍着江燈一弧。</p>
<h3>迷途</h3>
<p>— 古丁</p>
<p>過去是一段迷途，現在又何嘗不是呢？就是將來，也還是的，祇不過人人不敢想，不能想，也不必想罷了。</p>
<p>從這個迷途落到另一個迷途，人生是一段旅程，旅程兩畔是叢密的森林，森林裏是黑的，黑得沒有一點光。所以，記得你曾經吶喊需要光明，其實這種吶喊是自擾的笨事。人生旅途上，沒有路燈：如果有，那便是太陽，或者月亮，在雲縫裏偷偷的露一下，讓你不致於太難摸索。</p>
<p>但是摸索依舊是太難的事。</p>
<p>這裏是迷途，那邊也是迷途。這裏荊棘叢生，那邊叢生荊棘。玫瑰薔薇都長着小刺，路畔的野花野草還會光滑嗎？行路難，到處都是迷途呢！</p>
<p>也許會有一顆明潔的星，能引領一個迷途的人；可是也有作惡的鬼火，專作陷害的工作。</p>
<p>怎末呌幸運的人生？也許所謂幸運，就是糊塗的遮掩而已。在迷途上徘徊的人會看不淸自己面前的路，如果自以為坦平大道，放心踏下脚步，就有陷落的危險。</p>
<p>危險，人生到處是危險。眼珠子永遠看不明白，除了意志的力量之外，我想，就沒有東西能解决迷途的了。</p>

<h3>紐約博覽會中　冰模特兒惡作劇</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>世界博覽會在紐約舉行，已歷三月，會塲時有糾粉，尤以游藝部份爲甚。因紐的市商曾投資一千七百萬元其中，故一切力求商業氣味與色情化。前者中央會塲表演猥褻裸舞，由常局嚴厲制止，將爲首諸舞女驅逐出塲，氣象頓時一新。但近又恢復舊觀，頗有想人非非。有所謂「冰模特兒示威」（Frozen　Alive　Death　Defying），即由舞女當衆裸身臥入如棺材形之冰匣中，受寒氣侵凌，互爭時間久暫，取悅觀衆。冰凍舞台入口處佈置甚精，懸掛著名舞星之照片及其冰凍時間，好奇者入塲欣賞，納門票費若干。表演手續甚簡。演者先以冷水擦身，即由助手羿之仰臥於一長方形透明冰匣中，凍摩可四寸，高二尺，於是自踵至頂漸决覆以冰瓦，肌膚熨貼冰中，熱氣奔騰，至殭硬程度，始抬出，用酒精擦身，即能恢復常態。事雖平淡，但每日趨觀者，不下萬人。有安妮泰者，肌肉耐寒特甚，會臥冰棺中歷二十一分鐘之久，獲得冠軍，頃向記者發表談片，略謂：「這是舞界失業同志最新發明的賺錢方法，每日臥冰三次，維持生計。這種表演毫無虛假，我們入棺的時候，全身旣不塗油，也不敷膏，下身僅塡毛巾兩塊，何等吃苦耐勞，這當然絕對不傷風化。現在冰棺中的持久記錄。暫由敝人保持，望姊妹們竭力擁護。」她的話雖冠冕堂皇，但警察常局曉得她們是一種惡作劇，企圖利用「苦肉計」博得社會同情，破壞法紀，牟圖厚利。現在專家正硏究制裁的方法。</p>
<p>藝人漫記</p>
<h3>從舞台到銀幕（中）</h3>
<p>— 銀笛筆錄</p>
<p>—袁美雲女士口述—</p>
<p>就在我出演天蟾舞台的時候，天一影片公司主人邵醉翁先生，到天蟾來看我的戲，其時天一正籌備攝製「游藝大會」有聲片，邵先生就來與我商量，要我加入客串，我答應了，在「游藝大會」一片中，有許多歌舞及平劇的穿挿，我參加了一齣「游龍戲鳳」，這便是我開始踏上銀幕的階梯。</p>
<p>此後，邵先生就和我商量，請我担仟天一的基本演員，那時我還沒有決定完全放棄舞台生活，以僅答應訂一年的合同，並規定一年中祇拍三部戲，這樣，我在天一便陸續演了「小女伶」「飛絮」「生機」三部片子，其中「小女伶」是我正式担任女主角的第一部作品，那時我是十五歲。</p>
<p>翌年，我由天一轉入藝華，這時我已漸漸感覺到電影藝術的重要，於是我也開始從事於第八藝術的硏討與觀摩。我在藝華，主演的片子先後達十部以上，第一部是岳楓導演的「中國海的怒潮」，此外有「人間仙子」「逃亡」「花燭之夜」「碧玉雄心」「海天情侶」「三〇三大血案」「化身姑娘」「花開花落」等等，其中最使我不願意演的便是「化身姑娘」，最近還拍了兩本續集，爲了情面的關係，使我無法拒絕，這苦衷也許在觀衆們是不諒解的，但我實在是出於無奈。</p>
<p>戰事發生了，各影片公司停頓，於是我又意外地踏上了平劇舞台，在卡爾登戲院唱了半個月；卡爾登的邀請我，是有一點淵源的，因爲過去我曾在華安影業公司的「斬經堂」一片中客串，與周價芳先生在銀幕上合作過，而卡爾登的主持者即是以前華安的幾位鉅頭，最初是陶伯遜吳邦藩兩光生，代表卡爾登與我談判，翌日即邀同周信芳先生，在大光明咖啡室邀我吃飯，周信芳先生表示希望我冉在舞台上合作的意思，使我對舊時的舞台生涯勾起一個美妙的幻想，我欣然接受了他們的要求，但這時因爲我另有到重慶去的計劃，所以僅允演唱半個月，卡爾登方面表示半個月也好，因此祇訂了半個月的合同，半個月期滿之後，卡爾登也就暫時停鑼了。</p>
<p>章遏雲自上次黄金輟演後，戴譽北返，現在津法租界作寓公，暑期內不再出演。前有信來滬，據云重陽節後將重來滬，在黄金出演，大約係接譚富英張君秋之後塲，同來者爲楊寳林葉盛蘭馬富禄等原班云。</p>

<h3>星六星紀之八—？</h3>
<p>下面一篇小說，就是這位？小姐的大作，她從前在麗都伴舞，現在喬遷到大都會去了。有一次她在路上無意遇着我，備致仰慕的意思，過一天便把這篇佳著送來，請我改正。我看她年紀不過廿上下，居然有有</p>
<p>（三六）這樣的才調，實在是値得獎掖的後進，又因原文篇幅太長，所以特地破工夫替她剪縮一下，以實本刊。諸位如能猜着她的姓名，她和我都當略具薄酬，奉答雅意。她容貌很美麗，舞藝也很好，現在，也算是我的學生了。下期當將她的姓名發表，您等着罷。</p>
<p>『滬西的一條馬路，西半段是最好的住宅區，環境極優美，要乘電車得向東走一段路。</p>
<p>已是中夏的季節了，夏夜是最悅人心意的。這條幽靜的馬路上，除了營營遂逐的人們外，又多添了一批漫無心事的夏夜享樂者，邊行邊談或輕歌低唱。</p>
<p>這裏面有一對靑年的行人，男的的二十三四歲，穿着白西裝，黑領結，白鷄皮鞋。女的上身披着一件樹綠色的披肩，下半截露出了紅條子的麥綢旗袍，脚上穿着一雙藍白相問的京洋皮高跟鞋。他倆年齡相仿，並肩地走着。</p>
<p>「你這樣走過去覺得太吃力嗎？」男的說。</p>
<p>「不，還走得動，」女的微笑着回答</p>
<p>「記得上次我們同着八哥等到蜀腴去也是走的，再上一决便是和你表姊夫婦到晋隆去的一决了。」女的繼續着說。</p>
<p>男的忽然感覺着悲慨似的道：「但是，沒有一次不是吃完夜飯之後，你便坐着車去了，我便獨自回家，幾時纔能同出同歸呢」（未完）</p>
<h3>怪猩猩</h3>
<p>— 企華</p>
<p>李滋三兄弟的一貫胡鬧作風，在和唐阿曼契合演的「三劍客」後，可以說是打出了一路新的路綫。因爲一味的胡鬧，是不能作爲一張電影的主體的，但作爲部份的輔助，那尙不失爲滑稽要角。這部「怪猩猩」是繼着「三劍客一而來的，這里有着專演恐怖片的里昂安德威和羅哥西，李滋三兄弟同樣是退居於輔助地位的。然而以「怪猩猩」和「三劍客」比較起來，李滋的新嘗試似乎又失敗了。因爲，「怪猩猩」的導演，對於恐怖片的處理，如光綫，音響，鏡頭的角度，情緖氣氛，他的超越的手法是獲得了相等的成功；可是，由於李滋三兄弟的演戲機會較多，反損害了整個戲的統一。</p>
<p>影片開塲，寫怪猩猩出現後的恐怖情形，從疊印而拉出女僕的驚呌，再介紹這整個屋子完全籠罩在陰沉的情况之下，以及里昂亞德威和羅哥西的出塲；及午夜逼近，怪猩猩預吿的時間將到的剎那，屋外的雷雨交加；瑙瑪的焦慮；女俟的驚恐；鐘擺的特寫；里昂亞德威的而部特寫；樓上傳來的沉重脚步聲；…一秤窒息，驚恐萬狀的氣氛，把握得强固極了。可是李滋三兄弟的戲，—在遇到猩猩的幾塲戲，（有一個觀衆在喊爲什麽不拿出槍來打）。這太多的胡鬧，是破壞了整個戲的緊張空氣。</p>
<p>柯立蒂的出塲，太奇突；和對羅哥西這人物太少伏錢，所以，最後柯立蒂宣佈他是探員，而破獲里昂亞德威藏匿所在的時候，大家以爲是破案了；但羅哥西的追待於後，雖然是驚人之筆，却是更兀突了。</p>
<p>里昂亞德威，羅哥西，潘茜凱蘭的沉着，陰險，慌亂，都演得不壞。</p>

<h3>Japanese Occupation of Shatoujiao Threatens Hong Kong; A Serious Situation Created Between Britain and Japan; Japanese Planes Fly Over Hong Kong in Formation, British Issue Strict Warning; Chinese Troops Actively Deploy Defenses, Preparing for a Major Battle; Japan Attempts to Invade the Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River Again, Targeting Yichang</h3>
<p>Hong Kong - The Japanese troops invading Shenzhen continued their westward advance yesterday evening, occupying Wenxidu and Shatoujiao. The number of Japanese troops is three hundred. Japanese troops had already been stationed at these two locations on the 18th, blocking the transportation routes between China and Britain. Judging from the Japanese intentions, they still plan to invade Huiyang and Lunshui. Chinese military authorities have ordered the troops stationed in these two areas to be on strict alert, and are actively deploying defenses, preparing to inflict heavy losses on the Japanese troops. A certain Chinese unit has also arrived at a certain location, and a major battle is about to unfold. At around 9:00 am this morning, twelve Japanese aircraft in four formations flew at high altitude over Stanley in the southern part of Hong Kong, heading towards Tai O. British border defenses are on even higher alert. (18th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - According to a Guiyang dispatch, a meeting of Japanese naval officers decided to resume patrols on the Yangtze River, transfering the shallow-water gunboats that had been containing eastern Zhejiang to Wuhan, and preparing to invade the Chinese base in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River in mid-September, with Yichang as the target. (18th, Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - According to official sources, it is confirmed that at 8:30 am on the 18th, fifteen Japanese aircraft invaded Hong Kong's territorial airspace, flew near Chek Lap Kok, and advanced towards Ma Wan at high speed. At that time, the British defense forces did not fire at them. Also, after the Japanese troops occupied Shenzhen, they further occupied Shatoujiao on the evening of the 17th. (18th, Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan - More than 2,000 Japanese troops landed at Nantou on the 16th and occupied the Nanshen Highway. Currently, there are only more than 500 Japanese troops in Shenzhen, distributed along key points of the highway. Chinese local troops launched nightly attacks on the Japanese troops along both sides of the road overnight, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers. The Japanese troops were very panicked. With Hong Kong under serious threat, the British side has dispatched a unit of troops to Luotian to maintain alert. (18th, Dispatch) The Japanese troops at Anbu in the Chao-Shan area of Wengyuan have dispatched teams to invade Sangpu Mountain for several days, but they have all been repelled by the Chinese troops, suffering heavy casualties. (18th, Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - At 8:00 am today, eighteen Japanese bombers flew over British territorial waters near the Stanley Peninsula in Hong Kong. The coastal batteries did not open fire with warning shots, but it is reported that the British authorities will lodge a strong protest. (18th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Japanese troops occupied Shatoujiao in Shen Wan, located between Nantou and Shenzhen, at 8:00 pm yesterday. With this, the Japanese troops have expanded their operations to the entire border area of Hong Kong. At the same time, the British gunboats HMS Gnat and HMS Cricket have each been joined by a state-of-the-art motor torpedo boat. These torpedo boats have extremely high speeds and are easy to maneuver. (18th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - American officials here declared that fifteen Japanese aircraft flew over the skies of Stanley Peninsula in southwestern Hong Kong at 8:30 am this morning. The presence of Japanese aircraft in the skies there confirms the activities of Japanese troops in the Mayavan (transliteration) area. It is reported that Japanese troops occupied Shatoujiao near Hong Kong last night. (18th, Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan - Three Japanese warships suddenly arrived in the waters off Shayuchong in Bishuhuitai County, northeast of Kowloon, on the morning of the 18th, attempting to threaten British merchant ships traveling between the area and Hong Kong. (18th, Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to a special report from "Ta Kung Pao," the regular Japanese troops in China are now gradually being withdrawn back to the country for training, and replaced by reserve troops. This report has attracted great attention, as it is seen as an indication that Japan is preparing for large-scale military operations. It is claimed that the Japanese troops in Central and Northern China have recently been moving from the railway lines towards the coastal areas, also for the same motive. (18th, Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - The local newspapers here are paying close attention to the news of Japanese troop activities near Hong Kong, saying that the Japanese troops' landing in Shenzhen has created a serious situation with the British military. (18th, Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - The newspapers here today published reports from Guilin and Shaoguan with large headlines, stating that Japanese troops are currently planning large-scale operations in South China. The Japanese Navy has transferred warships from the north to the south, and the Taiwan Fleet has concentrated in Beihai. The long-rumored Japanese operations against Beihai may be realized. According to visitors from Beihai, the Japanese military authorities have already requested foreign ships and expatriates in Beihai to leave quickly. (18th, Haitong News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to observations by local Chinese here, the Japanese occupation of Shenzhen is intended to threaten the commercial shipping and air routes between Hong Kong and Chongqing. However, China National Aviation Corporation, which is 40% American-owned, has decided to continue its flights, but the departure and arrival dates may be known to the Japanese, increasing the risk of being attacked, and have become secret. (18th, Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing - According to an editorial in the English-language "Chou Pao" published here today, the Japanese occupation of Shenzhen is intended to demonstrate to Britain, so that it will accept Japan's demands. The position of Shenzhen is not important at all in terms of military operations against China. However, the Japanese occupation of this place allows the Japanese to cut off Hong Kong's food supply. But this move by the Japanese is still intimidation, and its purpose is nothing more than to have Britain fully accept all the demands it has made in the Tokyo conference. The newspaper also stated that in the past few months, Britain has made several mistakes in dealing with Japan. First, the attitude it expressed when the Japanese blockaded the British and French concessions in Tianjin was too weak. Second, Britain should not have held the Tokyo conference with Japan. Third, Britain should not have concluded a preliminary agreement with Japan. Fourth, it should not have unilaterally declared its willingness to hand over the four Chinese suspects. The Japanese intimidation policy has been effective in the past, so it is now trying to continue to use this policy. As for the Japanese claim that the occupation of Shenzhen is aimed at cutting off the supply of military supplies to the Chinese army, it is completely deceptive. Its purpose is clearly to prepare for a blockade of Hong Kong. In the future, the British warships transporting food will probably also be interfered with by the Japanese. If that is the case, a public conflict between Britain and Japan will certainly be unavoidable. In short, if Britain does not show a tough attitude, we firmly believe that Japan will take such a risky action. Therefore, the key for Britain in the future is to declare its own tough attitude, and Britain has the assistance of other democratic countries and dominions, and it is more than capable of dealing with Japan.

<h3>Chinese Troops in Southern Hubei Occupy Lukou</h3>
<p>Pingjiang - The Lukou intersection between Bainiqiao South and Linqiao in Southern Hubei was occupied by Chinese troops on the 15th. The supplies and ammunition stored by the Japanese in the area were also burned by the Chinese. At noon, the Japanese troops at Bainiqiao attempted to reinforce Lukou, engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese troops until 4:00 pm, but were still unable to withstand and retreated. (17th, Dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo - Three Japanese warships and more than twenty motorboats are currently anchored on the surface of Yueyang Lake. There have been no abnormal movements in the past two days. The Chinese and Japanese troops on the north bank of the Xinqiang River are still in a state of confrontation. A Chinese unit operating behind Japanese lines in Yueyang once attacked the Lukou railway station, fifteen miles west of Linhu, on the morning of the 15th. In the afternoon, more than 300 Japanese infantry and artillery launched a joint counterattack against the Chinese. The two sides fought fiercely for the Lukou railway station. The fierce battle lasted until 4:00 pm, when the Japanese retreated towards Linhu. The Chinese troops then destroyed the Lukou railway station and the tracks at both ends. It will be difficult for the Japanese to repair and reopen the line in the short term. (17th, Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops Encircle Pinghu County Town</h3>
<p>Jinhua - On the night of the 17th, a certain unit of Chinese troops advanced to the vicinity of Pinghu to monitor the Japanese troops on the Pinghu-Zhapu Highway, and deployed to attack Pinghu. The attack was launched simultaneously at noon on the 13th, and they encircled Pinghu County Town. The Japanese resisted stubbornly with strong fortifications, and fierce fighting is still underway. (17th, Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The War Situation in Henan Becomes Quiet; Japanese Troops Withdraw from Changtaiguan to Xinyang</h3>
<p>Luoyang - The war situation in Henan has been quiet for a long time. In southern Henan, since the Chinese army recovered Minggang and attacked Changtaiguan, the Japanese were extremely panicked. In addition to holding Changtaiguan, Xinyang and other strongholds, they have not taken any action, and have set up wire fences outside the fortifications to prevent the Chinese army from engaging in hand-to-hand combat. There has been no change in recent days due to heavy rains and mountain torrents. The Japanese troops at Chihu in eastern Henan were previously besieged by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. The Japanese troops in Chenliu, in retaliation, once launched a night attack on Da Guantou, but were also defeated by the Chinese army. In recent months, there have been continuous heavy rains. In addition to the Shaxin Road being washed away and unable to be open to traffic, the Chinese guerrilla teams have been extremely active, destroying the railway bridges near Luowangzhai and other places along the Longhai Line, and damaging many sections of the road between Shachen and Tongqi. The Japanese are extremely anxious about the difficulty of transportation. Nearly 700 engineers and Chinese laborers have been transferred from Haizhou to rush to repair the wooden bridges on the Shaxin Road. The Chinese are trying to attack. The main force of the Japanese troops in northern Henan was originally in the Bo'ai Xinxiang area. The majority of them were taken east by train. On the 9th and 10th, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese troops in the Baixiang Chongyi area, and several times pressed into the village gates, but were unsuccessful due to heavy rain and flooding. Only more than a hundred Japanese soldiers were eliminated on the major roads. Observing the current situation as a whole, the Japanese troops in southern and eastern Henan seem to be securing the occupied strongholds and attempting to improve transportation. The Japanese troops in northern Henan are also attempting to echo the Japanese troops in southeastern Shandong in order to suppress the base areas of the Taihang Mountain guerrilla forces. (17th, Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanyang - The Japanese troops in Changtaiguan have withdrawn to Xintai, and a regiment of a certain Chinese unit has advanced to Changtaiguan. The Japanese troops in Xinyang are stationed in Wushengguan. (16th, Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Yunnan Has Become the Center of Domestic and Foreign Trade; The Customs Revenue of Mengzi Has Increased Significantly; Tengyue and Simao Are Also Better Than Before</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to news here today, since the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, Yunnan has become the center of domestic and foreign trade. The trade entering and leaving through the Mengzi Customs alone reached 73,165,025 yuan last year, not counting the import of munitions. According to the Mengzi Customs, the tax revenue in 1937 was only 1,415,764 yuan, but it increased to 4,424,197 yuan in 1938. The main goods exported from the Mengzi Customs are tin and Yunnan marble, with exports reaching 28,810,629 yuan last year. The main imports are cotton, totaling 12,479,768 yuan. According to the Chinese side, if the transportation capacity of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway can be increased, imports and exports will definitely increase further. Currently, 150,000 tons of goods are transported from Haiphong to Yunnan every month, of which only 10,000 tons come via the railway. The authorities of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway are now trying to increase the transportation capacity of the line, and it is expected that it can be increased to 30,000 tons per month by the end of the year. It is reported that the goods exported through the Customs last year reached 41,849,454 yuan, and imports reached 31,315,571 yuan. Now that the government is making every effort to encourage the export of tin, pig bristles, and tung oil, and the import of gasoline, machinery, tools, and automobiles, the trade volume of Mengzi is bound to increase significantly. In addition, the trade volume of Tengyue, Simao, and other customs has also increased compared to before. The tax revenue of the Longzhou Customs on the Guangxi-Annam border was only 80,000 yuan in 1937, but it increased to 800,000 yuan in 1938. In other words, it increased tenfold in one year. (18th, Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Four Provinces of Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi Have a Bumper Harvest</h3>
<p>Chongqing - According to a report from the Central Agricultural Research Institute today, the agricultural harvest in Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Guangxi this summer has increased by 25% compared to 1938. Due to the drought in western Sichuan, the harvest has decreased separately. This year, the government has controlled the increase in harvests in various provinces for the following reasons: (1) The cultivated land has increased by 10% compared to before. (2) The weather has been favorable. (3) Under the guidance of the government, the farming methods have been greatly improved. The government is now planning to organize refugee rural work teams to assist farmers in free work without taking any fees. However, the lives of the refugees will be maintained by the government. For the autumn harvest in Sichuan, it is planned to use these refugees. According to Chinese sources, 283,000 refugees fled from the Yellow River breach in Henan last summer. Currently, 274,000 of them have obtained new farmland in the rear and established new colonies to continue farming and living. As for the other 9,000, they are now engaged in gold mining in the Jinling Mountains in southern Shaanxi. According to reports, the gold mine there has been operating for three years and has always used refugees fleeing famine to work. These refugees are currently subsidized by the government with two yuan per month, plus a daily wage of 2.5 jiao. As for rural women, they are mostly engaged in handicrafts to improve the living conditions of the new colonies. (18th, Associated Press Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Understanding the True Nature and Future of the Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Looking at the recent mindset of the people in Shanghai, the wealthy families are only worried about the unsustainable sources of daily necessities. The middle class is only worried about the continued rise in the prices of all goods. This is the psychological state of the vast majority. And some who have lost their conscience are either scheming to evade funds, or hoarding goods to seek a good price, or stirring up trouble to engage in speculation and manipulation. Shanghai indeed has its underlying factors of unrest, but the general unrest of society is caused by psychology. Psychological unrest is reflected in the volatility of the black market exchange rate. The volatility of the black market exchange rate further increases the psychological unrest of society. Cause and effect form a cycle. This is not the true nature of the facts, but those who lack a firm understanding and determination are like blind men on blind horses, feeling dizzy and frightened.</p>
<p>Can the market price of the black market exchange rate in Shanghai represent the true value of the legal tender? Even speculators know that this is not the case. The legal tender has its own value. What the people of Shanghai see is only the black market, only the surface of a corner of Shanghai. Those extreme egoists believe that only by purchasing gold and foreign currency can the safety of their property be ensured. But do they not realize that the seemingly high value of gold and foreign currency today is not because their value is calculated in legal tender? If the legal tender loses its standard for calculation, then the gold and foreign currency they possess will inevitably be calculated in another currency. Whether this is expensive or cheap, beneficial or harmful, even with clever plans, cannot be predicted. We should know that currency has no inherent value. People give it value. The high value is based on supply and demand, born of trust. With trust and dedication, what difference does it make whether it is gold or paper? Without trust, gold cannot cure hunger or thirst. The legal tender has its own true value. Therefore, is it not foolish to follow the black market and trample on the legal tender, merely creating opportunities for speculators?</p>
<p>However, reducing the black market has its benefits: the high price of imported goods makes the public's life trend towards thrift, unintentionally. Secondly, as a result of the natural reduction of imported goods, the tariff revenue of the occupied areas is greatly reduced. Thirdly, because the tariffs paid are still calculated based on the legal exchange rate, and they convert this into black market exchange rates, the tax revenue is invisibly discounted greatly. Fourthly, high exchange rates and expensive foreign goods make it difficult for them to dump their monopolized industrial and commercial goods, and the cost is heavier. Fifthly, it reduces the amount and profit of their buying foreign exchange. It is a pity that as long as the black market exchange rate does not stop for a day, its foreign exchange trading cannot be stopped for a day. If the black market futures trading remains unchanged for a long time, then speculators will take advantage of the opportunity. If the pursuit of gold and foreign currency is endless, then the value of the legal tender will also fluctuate. Therefore, today's black market exchange rate only confuses people and hinders normal industry and commerce. This is why this newspaper has repeatedly advocated fundamental reforms.</p>
<p>It is important to know that "China has endless treasures and resources, so the legal tender has endless reserves and credit." The value of the legal tender seen in the Shanghai black market exchange rate is an illusion caused by the field of vision, and not the true nature of the legal tender. Therefore, if you give up the credit of the legal tender, then those who take advantage of the opportunity to enter will be worse than the legal tender. Weighing the pros and cons, calming down and thinking quietly, those who use the legal tender as a desperate bet can also repent and return. Those who are uneasy about the legal tender and compete to make a living in the black market not only do not harm the true value of the legal tender, but only harm their own assets. This is very clear. Even in terms of the phenomenon of the legal tender, it will definitely not be depreciated by the black market forever. The power of manipulation is limited, and the actual application is endless. The sharp reduction of the black market has the most severe impact on a corner of Shanghai, and it also damages the trade of various countries with China. In order to protect their rights and interests, and to maintain this market, countries will not sit idly by and watch the legal tender be trapped in the black market. For example, the British recently increased the credit loan amount from 500,000 pounds to 3 million pounds, and the United States purchased 5 million US dollars of Chinese silver. The Soviet Union has agreed to a large credit loan through the establishment of the Sino-Soviet Chamber of Commerce. In addition, the scope of applying barter trade methods is expanding. All of these are ways to enrich China's economic strength during the war of resistance and indirectly strengthen the foundation of the legal tender. With such a trend, the flourishing of the legal tender has its own reliable factors. The volatile black market and the blind psychology will definitely not last long in blindness and volatility.</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Decide to Cooperate Effectively to Stabilize China's Legal Tender; Britain Increases Credit Loans to China; Discussions Underway to Replenish the Equalization Fund</h3>
<p>Observers in London here all said that Britain and the United States have decided to continue to support China's legal tender. Xu Kan, Director-General of the Chinese Ministry of Finance, is currently in Hong Kong, in contact with Chinese and foreign bankers. The details are highly confidential. It is heard that British banks are preparing to add funds to replenish the exchange equalization fund to prevent the legal tender from continuing to depreciate. The reason for the depreciation of the legal tender is that China has purchased a large number of foreign goods and various raw materials. Now that Britain has agreed to increase credit loans to China to 3 million pounds, it will naturally reduce the pressure on the legal tender. As for the United States, it does not seem to intend to allocate funds to join the equalization fund. The country has already given China a credit loan of 25 million US dollars, and has also continued to purchase Chinese silver, recently purchasing as much as 5 million US dollars, which will naturally benefit China. The Chinese here also said that not to mention other countries, as long as Britain and the United States do their best, it will be enough to maintain the stability of the legal tender. Once the equalization fund is replenished, it can respond to all possible manipulations. (18th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>The government and financial circles in Washington here were deeply concerned last night about the situation of China's currency system. They claimed that they knew nothing about what actions the United States would take on the current Chinese currency system. The only effective measure the United States government can take is to directly participate in China's exchange equalization fund. However, well-informed sources claimed that they learned that there was no request made here or in Paris for the United States and France to participate in this matter. (18th, Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>A reporter from Havas News Agency in London recently learned that Britain has signed an agreement with China to increase commercial credit loans from 500,000 pounds to 3 million pounds, so that China can use it to purchase transportation tools and other goods from Britain. According to well-informed sources, part of this credit loan has already been used by China to lease ships to load the purchased goods and transport them to China through the port of Yangon. Politicians here expressed their welcome after hearing the news, and said that it is gratifying that the British government has made this decision at a time when the Japanese government is seeking to seize the silver reserves in Tianjin. (17th, Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>London - According to news here today, although negotiations on the British loan of 3 million pounds to China for export have been completed, there are still some technical issues that have not been resolved, so it has not been formally signed. It is heard that the interest on this loan is 5%, to be repaid in 14 years, with bonds issued by the Bank of England and underwritten by various private banks. (18th, Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hong Kong - Some foreign newspapers here yesterday published news about currency negotiations being held in Hong Kong, claiming that HSBC Manager Glynne participated in the discussions. Glynne resolutely denied in the "China Mail" today that he had negotiated or discussed currency matters with the Chinese and British Equalization Fund Committee members Rogers, Soong Tzu-wen, or Xu Kan. (18th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Currency and Silver Reserves Issues Cannot Be Resolved by Britain and Japan Alone; The Opinions and Interests of Relevant Countries Must Be Considered; Japan's Resentment Makes the Prospects for the Tokyo Talks Bleak</h3>
<p>London - Reuters' diplomatic reporter said that the British government has now decided that the currency and silver reserves issues raised by Japan to the British government cannot be regarded as purely local issues, and are obviously events that affect the interests of other countries. Therefore, it believes that conducting this matter on a purely British-Japanese basis cannot achieve beneficial results. If such economic proposals are to be discussed further, efforts must be made to consider the opinions and interests of third parties. It is heard that this British government opinion has been sent to the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, in the form of instructions. It is expected that Craigie will now discuss it with the Japanese authorities. The British government has always acknowledged that in the final discussion of the current situation in China, economic issues cannot be excluded. However, when making this discussion, the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty and other relevant treaties must have the opportunity to express their opinions. Britain has fully informed each relevant country of the progress of the British-Japanese talks. However, this decision was made entirely by the British government itself, and each relevant country has now been notified separately. Reuters' diplomatic reporter also learned that much progress has been made in the Tokyo discussions on cooperating with Japan to maintain order and policing in Tianjin, and that an agreement is trending in that direction. (18th, Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Craigie and Kato Met Twice Yesterday</h3>
<p>Tokyo - According to the Japanese political side, since British Ambassador Craigie requested a postponement of the continuation of the British-Japanese conference, the satisfactory outcome of the British-Japanese talks has become increasingly bleak. Craigie met with Japanese representative Kato yesterday, and met with Kato twice again today. According to the British Ambassador, the reason why the meeting must be postponed is the economic problem in Tianjin. The British government must seek the opinions of various autonomous regions and other third countries, because this problem has a great relationship with the interests of third countries. It is heard that Kato has asked Craigie to urge the London government not to deliberately delay. (18th, Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Accusing Britain of Deliberately Delaying, the Japanese Side Expresses Resentment</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Minister Kato's feelings about the British reply are as follows: Regarding the issue of handing over cash, Japan may have room for consideration. However, Japan has already repeatedly stated that it absolutely cannot separate negotiations on economic issues and security issues. Further prohibiting the circulation of legal tender is also on the agenda. The British side said that if Japan has a good plan, it might as well hold another meeting. I think these words are really the British side deliberately fooling Japan. After meeting with Craigie, Minister Kato immediately visited Foreign Minister Hata, making an important agreement for an hour and a half. Afterwards, he further summoned Colonel Zhezhi from the Army Department and Director Sawada in the director's office to negotiate. The result is that the British side's attitude is extremely insincere, which really makes the Japanese side feel indignant. Therefore, the Japanese side has decided to permanently adhere to the previous policy towards Britain to deal with its cunning strategy, and has issued a final warning to urge it to realize.

<h3>The Danzig Question: Countries Intensify Intellectual Competition; Britain and France Say Peace Plan is Divisive; Germany and Italy Promote Imminent Crisis</h3>
<p>London - Although various British newspapers have reported on the so-called peace plan from European capitals, according to official sources obtained by Reuters' diplomatic correspondent, there is no truth to the claim of a four-power conference involving Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. This rumor is merely another smokescreen in the "war of nerves," aimed at sowing doubt in Poland about the true intentions of the British government and creating an opportunity to blame countries that reject this plan. Observers generally agree that convening a conference cannot resolve the Danzig issue. The first essential point is that if a conference is to be convened, Poland must be a major participant, and the Soviet Union cannot be excluded. As for whether such a conference is needed, London sources believe that this is not a matter for the British government to decide, nor should it express any opinion. London deeply admires the Polish government's calm and patient approach to the situation. British circles do not feel overly nervous about the current situation. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris - The French remain calm in the face of what is generally regarded as a joint military and diplomatic exercise by the dictatorial states. Newspapers report that Germany has two million men and Italy has one million men ready to fight. Efforts are being made to spread rumors of a four-power conference in various ways, but the newspapers all say that these efforts to weaken the morale of democratic countries are doomed to failure. The newspaper "Le Temps" reported that the Holy See would not convene a four-power conference unless it had a guarantee of success, which is not currently expected. This clamor and these spectacular measures do not mean that Hitler has already decided to wage war, regardless of the danger. It may be a new way to weaken the resistance strategy of democratic countries and push intimidation to a certain point, which may have been decided, but there are good reasons why it cannot be reached. If so, then Germany's calculations will soon be proven false by events. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>Berlin - Newspaper readers are now paying attention to the renewed propaganda of shocking news about Polish mistreatment of Germans, which was carried out last year. People are tense, expecting an imminent crisis. Germans generally believe that Hitler has a plan in mind, but they cannot guess its nature. Unofficial circles generally believe that when the time comes, Hitler will take swift and decisive action to catch his opponents off guard. Political circles are eager for the German people not to panic excessively, but foreigners who have been living here for a long time feel that people are becoming increasingly uneasy. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Rome - Here, there is a continued feeling of hesitation about the Danzig situation. Italian newspaper editorials are almost unanimous in saying that this situation requires a drastic solution and that compromise is not allowed. The Italian newspaper "Il Popolo d'Italia" stated that Britain knows that the serious situation cannot be resolved unless Poland and Germany conclude an agreement within hours. If Britain resorts to force and opposes fair compensation, it will prove that its policy is not fair but supports Poland's rights, which is a policy of aggression and occupation. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>The Situation in Danzig is Complex; Military and Diplomatic Measures are Combined; Polish Commissioner Meets Again with City Council Chairman; Over a Thousand National Socialist Party Soldiers Parade</h3>
<p>Warsaw - Political figures here are mostly pessimistic about the situation, saying that the combustible elements of the German-Polish dispute are in danger of exploding. However, this mood has greatly eased today. It is reported that both sides are now negotiating various outstanding issues. The Polish Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, has been ordered to do his best to promote these talks. Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck yesterday received the French Ambassador, Noel, and the Romanian Ambassador, Franasovici. The British Embassy is maintaining very close contact with the Polish Foreign Ministry. The Polish public generally feels that anti-German sentiment in Poland should not be excessively激昂, so many serious accidents have fortunately been avoided. Poland believes that German journalists were shot near the Vistula Bridge yesterday, as reported by Danzig. Polish residents in Germany, in view of the current tense situation, have fled from the Torun area of the Polish Corridor into Poland, most carrying only personal belongings. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Danzig - Signs of military activity here are becoming increasingly evident. Motorcade convoys, artillery units, and heavy trucks carrying steel-helmeted soldiers with bayonets are constantly passing through the streets. At night, the sound of heavy artillery drills is incessant. After dusk, large quantities of military supplies are continuously transported in. Military aircraft are often seen soaring in the sky. Gray air force uniforms have appeared on the streets. The Polish Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, returned here today after going to Warsaw to report to Foreign Minister Beck on his meeting with the Danzig German leader, Greiser. Negotiations between Chodacki and Greiser are expected to resume soon. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Danzig - After returning here from Warsaw yesterday, the Polish High Commissioner to Danzig, Chodacki, discussed with City Council Chairman Greiser the issue of the authority of Polish customs officers at the Danzig city customs. According to an announcement by the National Socialist Party, four infantry companies, one machine gun company, two tank defense companies, and two engineering teams belonging to the party's stormtroopers, totaling 1,500 personnel, are scheduled to parade in the city tonight. Thirty-five barracks required by these teams have been completed, and ten more are under construction. Near the barracks, shelters built of steel and concrete have been built on the hillside, trenches have been dug, and a garage has been built that can accommodate one hundred military trucks. There is also a gasoline depot with a capacity of 60,000 liters. Several open spaces in the forest near Danzig have been built as shooting ranges. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<h3>Dozens of French Aircraft Fly in British Exercise; Air Raid Situation Realistic</h3>
<p>London - London experienced its first "air raid" since the Great War today. A squadron of French bombers rumbled over the British capital in a defense exercise, startling millions of citizens, most of whom were working in offices in the bright sunshine or had already taken off their coats. As the French bombers and reconnaissance planes soared over London in succession, hundreds of thousands of people on the streets stared at the sky, and heads were moving in the windows. Many people looked from the roof and had a clear view of the "invading" aircraft. The first squadron of bombers was very high, followed by those flying less than a thousand feet, passing only one barrage balloon, and the rest of the balloons had been taken down to reduce the risk of accidents. At 2:30 p.m., seventeen fierce-looking heavy bombers (with square wingtips, in contrast to the elliptical wings of British fighters) approached and flew over St. Paul's Cathedral at a very low altitude, and the markings on each aircraft were clearly visible. Several bombers made a daring "attack" on the British air force station at Hornchurch at an altitude of 5,000 feet. First, six fighters took off from the air force station to patrol. Within five minutes of the appearance of the bombers, thirty "Spitfire" aircraft took off, and an exciting air battle ensued. The "Spitfire" aircraft charged in and out of the bomber formation. These "Spitfire" aircraft were the fastest of their kind. The bombers crossed the coast between Newhaven and Selsey at about noon, and several were attacked by British Air Force coastal guard aircraft and pursued as the bombers dispersed to attack various towns. Although the dense fog in the English Channel rose to an altitude of 5,000 feet to hide the "enemy" bombers, the interception by the guard aircraft was quite satisfactory. At about 3:00 p.m., several "enemy aircraft" flew around London again, indicating that the "attack" was over, and then flew back to their country. The British Air Force Department soon received a message from the French authorities saying that all aircraft had returned safely to their original bases in France. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<h3>British Sailors Suddenly Return to Duty</h3>

<h3>Britain and Poland Will Conclude a Formal Military Alliance; The Treaty of Alliance Between Britain and Turkey Has Also Been Submitted to the Turkish Government</h3>
<p>London - The diplomatic correspondent of the Daily Mail claims that the British-Polish treaty is now ready for signature, all points have been agreed upon, and only technical work remains. The treaty stipulates the method of Polish assistance and makes the assistance clear, unambiguous, and unlimited, that is, to immediately fight the aggressor and carry it through to the end. Although the drafting work has not yet been completed, both governments regard the constraints of the treaty as already in effect. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>London - Britain and Poland signed a declaration of mutual assistance on April 6 this year, which was of a temporary nature. Recently, the two sides have been negotiating to conclude a mutual assistance agreement of a permanent nature, which has been agreed upon. The legal advisor to the Polish government, Gorski, has recently arrived here and will work with experts from the British Foreign Office to sort out the clauses of the treaty. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>London - Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax are scheduled to return to the capital from their respective vacations on the 21st of this month to jointly study the international situation. If the situation becomes serious during this period, other cabinet members may also return to the capital for talks. The intention of the Axis powers' recent diplomatic moves is still unknown. The British government is closely monitoring them and claims that the British government has not received any proposals regarding the holding of a meeting between Britain, France, Germany, and Italy to find a solution to the Danzig issue. However, such a meeting would not be considered without the participation of Poland and the Soviet Union. At the same time, Germany is actively preparing militarily, the situation in Danzig is still tense, and the German and Italian authorities have declared that they maintain a joint relationship. The only way for Britain to deal with all this is to reiterate that Britain is determined to fulfill its guarantee obligations to Poland and to unite and act jointly with the countries participating in the peace front. This is being developed in many ways. For example, the exercise of French aircraft flying to Britain for bombing is actually important. Furthermore, the declarations of mutual assistance signed between Britain and Poland and Turkey are of a temporary nature, and negotiations are underway to replace them with formal treaties of alliance. A Polish legal expert is scheduled to arrive in London within days to sort out the clauses of the British-Polish alliance. As for the draft British-Turkish alliance, it was sent to the Turkish capital yesterday. It is heard that the validity period is limited to five years and may be extended by mutual consent of both parties. However, because the Turkish government is eager to establish a financial agreement stipulating the amount of British credit, and then sign the treaty of alliance, the establishment of the British-Turkish alliance may still have to wait a few days.

<h3>The Soviet Air Force is Incomparably Powerful; If the Enemy Ventures to Invade, They Will be Met with a Head-on Blow</h3>
<p>Moscow - Lieutenant General Ptukhin, Commander of the Air Force of the Leningrad Military District, recently wrote an article commemorating the Aviation Day on the 18th. His words said, "In recent years, the Red Air Force has made great progress in both quality and quantity. It has countless of the latest type of aircraft armed with sophisticated weapons, and they are piloted by excellent pilots. The skills and military training of these personnel are also reaching their peak. On the holiday of Aviation Day, which is welcomed by the people of the whole country, the air force personnel will contribute countless new achievements to the country. They are now able to ascend to any altitude at any time to fight the enemy and drop bombs. Here we can assert that at the same time, our air force is also constantly paying attention to the defense of the borders of the motherland of the working masses. If the enemy dares to attack our country, these eagles cultivated by Stalin himself will immediately take off to fight and destroy the enemy with deadly artillery fire." (TASS dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>Hungary is Also at a Critical Juncture; Has Germany Made Harsh Demands? The Hungarian Foreign Minister Flew to Rome from Germany Yesterday</h3>
<p>Munich - Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky arrived here today from Salzburg and immediately took a special plane to Rome to visit the Italian authorities. Rumors say that Germany had made several demands on Hungary. German newspapers have denounced them as nonsense. (Havas dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>The Hungarian Capital - The rumors circulating today about a meeting between Hitler and Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky have attracted special attention, because the Hungarian political and financial circles are now facing a crisis that is related to the life and death of Hungary. Unofficial reports from Berlin said that Germany had made a treaty to Hungary, which contains twenty-two articles. Foreign Minister Csáky told a reporter from a newspaper today that he was staying in Berlin in a personal capacity and was not negotiating with anyone. However, people here generally believe that Germany wants Hungary to join the Axis military alliance, so that Hungary will be bound militarily, politically, and financially. Hungary has been working hard to improve national defense and the army within the budget in the past 18 months. According to unofficial observers, if Hungary is used by Germany as a tool to fight against Poland, Yugoslavia, or Romania, then Hungary's independence will in fact no longer exist in the slightest. However, officials said that Hungary has not received a similar ultimatum. Hungary generally follows the Axis policy, but in any case, it must preserve its independence, and friendly countries must respect its independence. Reports quoted the words of the leader of the Agrarian Party, Eckhardt, saying that Hungary must fight for its independence. Officials said that the publication of these remarks is very meaningful, because it implicitly rejects Germany's willingness to help Hungary demand land from Yugoslavia and Romania in exchange for Hungary's complete obedience to German policy. (Reuters dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Berlin - People here are confused by the conflicting news about the activities of Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky in Germany, which is rumored by unofficial sources. Although it is rumored that the Hungarian Foreign Minister visited the German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop this afternoon, this has been denied by officials. According to highly reliable sources in Munich and Salzburg, the Foreign Minister had a long conversation with Hitler in Berchtesgaden this afternoon. Germany has not publicly announced the above-mentioned meeting. A statement from Berchtesgaden denied that Herr Hitler had met with the Hungarian Foreign Minister. (Reuters dispatch, 17th)</p>
<p>Paris - French newspapers are quite concerned about the news of German pressure on Hungary.

<h3>Another Incident on the Romanian-Hungarian Border; Romania Lodges a Protest</h3>
<p>The Hungarian Capital - Officials announced a short time ago that a dispute occurred on the border between Hungary and Romania at 11:00 a.m. today. The common location was between the towns of Nachishalongda and Meso強 in Carpathian Ukraine Province. The incident was caused by five Romanian border soldiers who crossed the border into Hungarian territory and attacked border defense soldiers. The soldiers immediately fired their guns in self-defense, killing two Romanian soldiers and capturing one. The other two fled back to Romania. After this incident occurred, the authorities sent personnel to conduct an investigation. (Havas dispatch, 17th)</p>

<h3>The North China Anti-British Tide Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Tianjin - This morning, British residents here all received letters from a group calling themselves the "Chinese Patriotic Youth League," warning them to leave Tianjin as soon as possible. A Reuters reporter also received such a letter, which openly stated the names and addresses of the recipients. The letters were sent through ordinary mailboxes and delivered by the post office. The letters stated that if the British did not leave Tianjin, they risked losing their lives and property at any time. If they hesitated, they would suffer the same fate as the Hutchison Company some time ago, which was destroyed by the Chinese to express the intense anti-British sentiment. The letters also blamed the Sino-Japanese war on the conspiracy of the Communist Party and stated that Britain was responsible for the prolongation of the Sino-Japanese war. This is why there is an anti-British sentiment throughout China. This tide is now surging and making the police unable to guarantee the absolute safety of the lives and property of the British residents. The letter was mimeographed on wax paper. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Tianjin - According to foreigners returning to Tianjin from Beidaihe, English leaflets have been posted in front of Chinese shops there, asking the British not to enter, as they will not sell anything to British residents. These leaflets were mostly posted by those who are leading the anti-British movement and have a considerable influence on the general shop owners. Even long-time customers who have been doing business for many years are politely but firmly asked to leave the shop and are even afraid to entertain them. Although the long-publicized three-day anti-British rally last weekend did not materialize, the anti-British movement continues unabated. Currently, those leading this movement have shifted their focus and are threatening foreign residents in the British Concession. (Reuters dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<h3>The Truth About the Japanese Bombing in Yichang</h3>
<p>Local News - The British naval authorities in Shanghai have asked Reuters to distribute the following text to various newspapers: The Japanese authorities have issued an article on the Yichang air raid on August 6, stating that no bombs fell on the premises of the Asiatic Petroleum Company or hit any third-country ships at the time. This is clearly inconsistent with the facts. Now, an excerpt of the report from the British naval officer in charge in Yichang, who witnessed the bombing that day, is announced to the public to clarify the truth. According to this report, the actual situation is as follows: (All times are Shanghai time) At 6:58 a.m., three light bombers dropped two bombs 250 yards from the British gunboat HMS Gnat and the river steamer Jianghua, and 100 yards from the gunboats Zhongshan and Changning, and several barges, killing one Chinese and injuring two Chinese, all barge workers. The barges suffered minor damage. The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. riverfront property was severely damaged. A large area 300 yards downstream from the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. was set on fire. The Japanese planes were bombing from an altitude of 5,000 feet, and the bombs all passed in a straight line over the Jianghua, Gnat, and Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. buildings. At 6:59 a.m., three light bombers dropped eight bombs, six of which landed on the Asiatic Petroleum Company's buildings, one hit a warehouse, and two landed outside the warehouse, but parallel to the buildings. The bomb lines were parallel to the riverside of the buildings and fell from an altitude of 4,000 feet. At 7:09 a.m., three light bombers flew in from downstream at an altitude of 4,000 feet, then dispersed, turned half left, and dropped three bombs at an altitude of 2,000 feet, one of which landed on the Asiatic Petroleum Company's riverside, and two landed in the water, 25 yards from the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s lighter, but one was less than 30 feet from the Xinchanghe, injuring the ship's chief mate and killing two and injuring three Chinese crew members. The ship suffered minor damage. At 9:33 a.m., the Gnat and the Minghua moved to moor in front of the Asiatic Petroleum Company's buildings. At 12:23 p.m., six planes bombed several sheds half a mile downstream from the company. After that, five planes flew away, and one plane soared over the ships moored in front of the company's buildings, then dropped what appeared to be an incendiary bomb from an altitude of 1,500 feet. The bomb passed over the Gnat and hit the stern of the Jiahe, and then flew away. The Gnat was moored 100 yards upstream from the Jiahe at the time, and the lighter Hankou and two barges were moored 100 yards downstream. The fire then spread to the Xinchanghe, and the upper parts of both ships' decks were burned. The photographs in the report, which claim that the British ship Jiahe was not damaged, are completely unbelievable. These photos seem to have been taken before the ship was hit.

<h3>Japanese Planes Attack Hunan</h3>

<h3>Over 600 Cases of Atrocities by Japanese Troops Against American Nationals in China in Two Years; Compiling a Register as a Basis for Future Negotiations; Japan Apologizes to the United States for the Case of an American Woman Being Slapped</h3>
<p>Washington - U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles yesterday confirmed the news that U.S. consular officials are compiling registers of cases of Americans in China being abused by Japanese troops since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War. Observers speculate that the registers will be used to express the U.S. position when presenting new protests to Japan or beginning to conclude new treaties with Japan. According to newspaper reports, although the compilation of the registers is not yet complete, more than 600 cases have been listed. Welles stated that the Japanese Embassy in Peiping has expressed its apology to the U.S. Embassy for the incident in Tianjin in which an American woman, Mrs. Little, was slapped by a Japanese sentry. The Japanese military authorities are continuing to investigate the case. Welles said that he had only received a preliminary report of the Japanese apology and had not heard the Japanese side's explanation that Mrs. Little was using too many Japanese "friendship certificates". (Associated Press dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Washington - Regarding the case of Mrs. Little, an American resident of Tianjin, being slapped by a Japanese sentry, the State Department recently received a preliminary report from the American Embassy in China, stating that the Japanese representative in Peiping has verbally stated to senior officials of the American Embassy that the Japanese government is very sorry and is conducting an investigation to clarify where the responsibility lies. The State Department is waiting to receive a more detailed report in order to handle it appropriately. (Havas dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<h3>Further News on the Anti-British Actions of Japanese Troops in Shantou; The British Consulate Accepts Japanese Demands Regarding the Incident of Ronin Surrounding the British Consulate</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence - After the fall of Shantou, all foreign firms and businesses have ceased operations. Foreign ships cannot enter the port, and more than 100 foreigners are living in Jiaoshi, waiting for the situation to become clear. There are British and American warships in the port, and foreign residents rely entirely on foreign warships for communication with the outside world and food supplies. British and American missionaries are working hard on charitable relief efforts, and various churches and hospitals are trusted by those in distress. As for the anti-British sentiment stirred up by the Japanese, which led to ronin surrounding the foreign merchants' club and the British Consulate on the 7th, the ronin shouted loudly and tried to rush into the British Consulate, but were stopped by British sailors. The mob was in chaos and trampled on each other, seriously injuring three or four people. On the 8th, the Japanese army captain Moriya made representations to the British Consulate. The British Consulate immediately telegraphed the British Naval Headquarters in Hong Kong for instructions and promised to reply on the 10th. On the morning of the 9th, the British destroyer HMS Duncannon arrived in Shantou from Hong Kong. Captain Pickering, the ship's captain, was ordered by the British naval commander to handle the above negotiations. At that time, the anti-British situation in Shantou was extremely dangerous. Thugs and ronin carried weapons and specifically provoked the employees of foreign firms. Anyone who had contact with foreigners on weekdays hid at home, closed their doors tightly, and dared not go out. At 10:00 a.m. on the 9th, British Consul Brian, accompanied by HMS Duncannon Captain Pickering and HMS Teignmouth Captain Barry, went to the Gakusei Hospital in Sakilok to see Consul Takai. At that time, Takai said that the five conditions were the minimum requirements. If the British Consulate did not recognize the first condition, it would fundamentally deny the facts. The British Consulate expressed that it could not accept it, and Takai refused to negotiate sternly. The British Consulate then left with the two captains and went to the customs inspection factory to meet with the Japanese military police captain Moriya. Then they went to the Zhongyuan Hotel to meet with the chief of the Japanese special affairs department, Oomoto, but were unable to meet him. At 3:00 p.m., the British Consul returned to Jiaoshi. The anti-British rumors outside became more intense. Dozens of Japanese troops were stationed in the two customs residences and the tax commissioner's residence on the top of Jiaoshi Mountain, changing into civilian clothes and looking around everywhere, as if they were plotting something. The whole Jiaoshi was in turmoil. HMS Duncannon urgently dispatched thirty or forty sailors, armed, to protect the British Consulate, and to guard the entrances of the roads by the sea to protect the residence of the head of the Taikoo and the foreign club. On the morning of the 10th, the British Consulate had received a reply from Hong Kong and was willing to compromise with the Japanese. At 10:00 a.m., they negotiated with Takai. The British Consulate was willing to investigate and punish the perpetrators, pay compensation for condolences and medical expenses, and also agreed to pay as required. As for the guarantee that such incidents would not occur in the future, the British side hoped that the Japanese army would stop the mob from deliberately infringing. The Japanese side also did not want to expand the matter, so they agreed to do so. On the evening of the 10th, the British sailors living in the British Consulate had withdrawn back to the ship, and the traffic cordon between the British Consulate and the outside world was completely lifted. It is heard that the Japanese army is planning to attack Jieyang and does not want to cause more trouble in the rear, so the Japanese side temporarily stopped the incident at the British Consulate.</p>
<h3>Recent Situation in Guangzhou; Refugees Return Home Due to the Pressure of Life; But Most Shops Are Unable to Operate</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence - The current shipping between Guangzhou and Hong Kong is being operated by the Taikoo Steamship Company's Fooshan and one Japanese ship, each sailing once a week. According to a visitor from Guangzhou, there are currently more residents in Guangzhou, and these people are returning from various places. Some of them are refugees who previously fled to the foreign concessions. Recently, their bags have been emptied, and they have no way to borrow money, so they are forced to return. There are also some who still have surplus funds, but recently the exchange rate between the national currency and the Hong Kong dollar is too far apart (currently, one yuan of the national currency is only worth 26 cents of the Hong Kong dollar). Enough food for a year has suddenly become enough for only three months. Therefore, those who are generally affected by the depreciation of the national currency are also eager to leave Hong Kong and return to their hometowns. In addition, some citizens previously fled to the countryside in the interior to take temporary shelter. At first, they thought they would be able to return home after a few months, but unexpectedly it lasted for a long time, and all their money was gone. Moreover, the villages were not peaceful, so they were forced to return to Guangzhou in despair. The above reasons are the actual reasons for the recent slight increase in the population of Guangzhou.</p>
<p>The Guangzhou occupied area was previously blockaded by the Chinese army, cutting off transportation, and there was a food shortage. Occasionally, citizens smuggled food into the city from various villages, but due to the inconvenience of the roundabout routes, the price of local rice transported to Guangzhou was very high. One Cantonese dollar could only buy a little over three catties of mixed coarse rice. In the past, ships from various villages were slightly accessible, and more late-harvested local rice entered the market. In the past week, it has been possible to buy five catties per dollar. As for daily necessities such as oil and salt, the price has fallen slightly due to the slightly smoother sales. Currently, soybean oil is valued at eight Cantonese cents per catty. The city's finances are currently maintained with the Cantonese mill coupons as the standard. All buying and selling transactions are calculated in mill coupons. As for the national currency (silver dollars), it has depreciated in the city. Not only has it broken the previous exchange rate of 144 between Cantonese dollars and national currency (that is, one national dollar is equal to one dollar and forty-four cents Cantonese), but it is even lower than Cantonese dollars. Currently, one national dollar is only worth about 80 cents Cantonese in Guangzhou, which is a reversal of the normal phenomenon. Most of the shops in the city are not open for business. After the great burning and looting, there are many people whose property has been completely destroyed. Shops that are unable to resume business account for six or seven out of ten. Currently, those that are open are food shops and grain shops, but they are all small capital sales. The merchants in the city are only seeking to make a small profit and have not yet had large enterprises with multiple assets and good business acumen to invest and operate together.</p>
<h3>Constant Fierce Fighting Near Xuzhou; The Tongshan Standing Army Destroys the Jinpu Train; The Pei County Assault Team Eliminates the Puppet Organization</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence - The Standing Armies of various counties, the People's Self-Defense Forces, and the guerrillas are constantly striking at the Japanese army, destroying transportation, and eradicating traitors. At 8:00 p.m. on the 1st of this month, Wang Huamin, the second company commander of the fifth detachment of the Tongshan Standing Army, led more than 50 troops to destroy the Bridge No. 144 east of Erbao Station, north of Sanbao Station on the Jinpu Railway. The bridge was completely torn down, and the rails were suspended in the air. Soldiers were ambushed nearby. When a train heading north arrived at the bridge at 12:00 p.m. that night, with a roar, the locomotive fell under the bridge. Some of the trains attached to the locomotive overturned on the side of the road, and some derailed. The Chinese ambush troops immediately swept the train with machine guns. The sound of machine guns was like a continuous burst. The Japanese soldiers who were not killed dared not fight back, and immediately climbed out of the train, covered their heads, and fled. After the event, Captain Wang led his team to carry out an inspection and counted that two drivers were killed, and a total of 13 Japanese soldiers were killed due to being hit, and 5 were injured. More than 30 passengers were injured or killed. The Chinese side only consumed bullets and suffered no damage. They also obtained a large number of long and short guns and other military supplies. When the Xuzhou Japanese military headquarters learned of this, they sent a military vehicle to assist, but the Chinese army had already safely withdrawn.</p>
<p>Also, the Chinese and Japanese armies near Xuzhou are in contact from time to time. The summary of the recent battles is as follows: (1) More than 30 Japanese soldiers stationed in Chu, attached with two cannons and a machine gun, searched the area of Baoguang Temple and were ambushed by the 5th Brigade of the Chinese army in Baozhuang, killing 5 Japanese soldiers and injuring more than a dozen. The Japanese army retreated to its original location. (2) More than 20 Japanese soldiers stationed in Chulan set out to search Tieying and were chased by the 5th Brigade again. The Japanese army suffered four casualties, and the Chinese army also suffered minor injuries to two soldiers. (3) The 5th Brigade supervised the 7th District Self-Defense Forces to completely destroy more than ten miles of power poles erected by the Japanese from Liuji to Pantang on the Haizheng Highway. (4) At 9:00 p.m. on the 1st of this month, Zhang Baoxue's department of the Chinese Independent Company attacked Liuquan Station and killed two Japanese soldiers. Since then, Feng Zigü, the magistrate of Pei County, has been effective in eradicating traitors and resisting the enemy. The number of puppet organization personnel killed has reached more than 20. Other puppet members in various places have also recently revolted. The county magistrate has telegraphed the province to report, saying, "Since the enemy occupied the county seat and the strongholds of various towns, the villains have colluded with the enemy to create chaos and have done all kinds of evil. I am unable to annihilate them in one fell swoop due to weak military force, so I changed my plan and selected the elite of the guerrillas and compiled them into several assault teams to lurk in various places to snipe and kill, and stipulate the incentive methods for striking the enemy and eradicating traitors. In less than ten days, Yan Weisän, the health section chief of the county puppet maintenance association and the puppet chief of the first district, and Han Ni's department, the commander of the 10th regiment, and the puppet chief intelligence station chief Ni Zunyi and other more than 20 people, were successively executed. The enemy officers and soldiers stationed in Zhangzhai are now also being sniped and two short guns have been obtained. In recent days, those who have even a little connection with the enemy and puppets have come to revolt and are allowed to start anew and are allowed to serve and surrender. The thieves' power has been slightly curbed. Regarding the reward money for eradicating traitors, I am willing to save on food and clothing and will never default. It is true that there will be brave men under heavy rewards."</p>
<h3>Huai'bei Salt Stocks Are Seized and Shipped South for Sale; The Lianghuai Salt Affairs Office Formulates Three Methods for Seizing and Shipping</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government of the Lusu War Zone Deputy Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters yesterday issued an order to the county governments, saying, "According to the letter from the Lianghuai Salt Affairs Office of the Ministry of Finance, the salt production of Lianghuai is the highest in Huaibei. Since the incident, a large number of salt stocks have been taken by the enemy, which is extremely regrettable. Although Huainan is also a salt area, there are no salt stocks in the warehouses to meet the market, and there are no new products waiting to be taxed in the market. Only the name remains. In this period of resistance, the people's food and the state's tax revenues in the interior are all worrisome. For the sake of the present, one is to reduce the enemy's material and financial resources, and the other is to seek to increase our income and enrich the strength of resistance. Therefore, the following three points are proposed to remedy this situation: (1) Select and dispatch cadres to sneak into the salt stock locations in the area and try to seize and ship them to Jinan for sale, so as to kill the enemy's momentum. (2) Broadly recruit private salt vendors to make them go deep into the enemy's rear and sneak in their strength. They should be able to use agile actions to move the salt stocks and transfer them to our area. They should also be given preferential treatment, pay taxes and be released. Implement the method of turning private into public. (3) All areas north of Chenjiayang in Funing and outside the ports are designated as salt activity zones without tickets. Once imported, they must first go to the nearest salt affairs agency to report for inspection and verification, and issue a cabin transportation manifest, and send people in batches to escort them to the tax collection zone to pay taxes and issue tickets. Anyone who crosses this inspection and verification zone without the above procedures will be charged with smuggling salt. The above measures have been decided and will be implemented immediately. I hope that the government will inform the local agencies of all counties to assist them uniformly and not to obstruct them, so as to remove commercial difficulties and speed up the ships. They should also be announced to the public so that merchants are happy to invest and salt workers are brave to seize and ship. The national economy and people's food will depend on it. The deputy headquarters and the provincial government believe that the three methods for seizing and shipping the salt stocks in Huaibei to Jinan for sale are all urgent tasks. I hope that the county magistrates of each county will be informed and will also inform their subordinates."</p>
<h3>The Jinghu Railway Is Greatly Threatened by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Wujin Correspondence - Guerrilla teams on the Jinghu Railway, jointly with the New Fourth Army, are constantly attacking the Japanese-occupied areas. Since the beginning of this month, the attackers have included Kunshan Bacheng Town, Shipai Town, and the vicinity of Chenmu in Suzhou. On the 1st and 2nd of this month, there were fierce battles with the Japanese army. There were also night attacks on Xiaxi Town and Hudi Town in Wuxi County. On the afternoon of the 6th, guerrillas repeatedly struck the Japanese army.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Editor,</p>
<p>I recently saw in today's newspaper that the Jiangsu Provincial Government announced the news about the county magistrates of various counties, which included the words "Cai Renbao, Commissioner of Pudong." However, I serve in the business community and have never participated in politics. It is possible that there is someone with the same humble name as me. I recently received inquiries from concerned relatives and friends, so I am writing to ask your newspaper to clarify this matter, to whom I am grateful. Sincerely, Cai Renbao. August 18.</p>

<h3>Whether Grain Is Being Hoarded; Banks Voluntarily Request Thorough Investigation; Hope Not to Take the Opportunity to Sell Off During the Suspension of the Market; The Saying That Foreign Rice Is Being Ordered Has Not Been Confirmed</h3>
<p>Since there has been an after-hours market, the rice price in this city has been out of control. The price has soared, and the people cannot make a living. Although the authorities have deliberated deeply, there is no definite solution for a while. It is rumored that foreign rice has been ordered and that the sale of rice at a fixed price is being handled, but these are mostly unconfirmed news. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Purchase of Foreign Rice Has Not Been Confirmed</p>
<p>Rice traders claim that the Municipal Council has ordered 100,000 bags of foreign rice, the first batch being 18,000 bags, but this saying has not been recognized as a final decision. The Municipal Council has been planning for a long time to address the issue of people's food. Although the Foodstuffs Committee has no way to dredge the source, there is only discussion of ordering foreign rice, but it has not been formally approved by the board of directors. Even if it is transported to Shanghai and sold at a fixed price, it is like a drop in the bucket. Therefore, all parties hope that the Municipal Council will announce a concrete relief measure to the whole city. Yesterday, someone claimed that the so-called 18,000 bags of foreign rice are only a small part of them, and that Yu Qiaqing procured them in his private name to provide relief to the poor, which seems to be more reliable.</p>
<p>The Market Is Closed to Take the Opportunity to Organize</p>
<p>The Market Management Committee of the Shanghai Soybean and Rice Trade Association posted a notice in the market yesterday morning: "Due to the market situation exceeding the limit price and the after-hours market being in chaos, it has been decided by the Market Management Committee to temporarily suspend the market for two days from today. Normal business will resume on the 21st (Monday)." It is planned to take advantage of the holiday period to organize the market situation. The association also convened a 42-resolution committee meeting at the office in the North Market at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, which resolved that from the 21st onwards, all market operations must be registered in a practical manner, and the consignor and the sales outlet must be recorded in detail, so that transportation and sales are consistent and convenient for reporting.</p>
<p>Request to Re-investigate the Rice Stocks</p>
<p>The exact number of rice stocks in the godowns in this port was previously investigated and published by the Foodstuffs Management Committee of the Municipal Council. However, rumors have been rising in the market in recent days, with some suspecting that banks are hoarding them. Now, the banks in this port have specifically sent a letter to the Foodstuffs Management Committee of the Municipal Council requesting another detailed investigation and formal announcement to clarify the truth. According to another source, the procedure for investigating the stocks of rice is extremely cumbersome and is not easy to accomplish unless one is well aware of the contents of the hoarding. The banks' request for a detailed investigation is also something that should be done under the current situation and is very proper. However, it is hoped that all hoarders will disclose everything publicly, and the citizens can forgive them. The most important thing to pay attention to is whether there are large households who take the opportunity to sell off the rice and distribute it for sale during the three days of the rice market's closure, in an attempt to conclude at the highest price to unload their responsibility. This cannot but be paid attention to. The reporter sincerely hopes that all citizens will work together in harmony to maintain their livelihoods. From the day the rice market reopens on the 21st, the rice price will quickly return to its original limit price, so that the general public still has room to breathe.</p>
<p>Secretly Raising Rice Prices Is Punishable by Fine</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, a customer came to a rice shop near Lafayette Road to buy four stones of rice and secretly stated that it would be 30 yuan per stone. However, someone only brought 50 yuan in national currency, which was 70 yuan short, so they asked for an invoice and the rice to be delivered to someone's house, and they would bring the remaining money. However, the shop assistant stated that the invoice could only be opened at 20 yuan per stone, totaling 80 yuan for four stones, and a receipt for 50 yuan would be collected, otherwise it would be inconvenient. Someone said yes, and waited for the rice to be delivered to their house. Someone found 30 yuan in national currency (according to the price on the invoice), but the shop assistant refused and insisted on 70 yuan. As a result, the two parties argued, and someone took the invoice to confront them. As a result, the shop was fined 50 yuan in national currency for secretly raising rice prices. It is hoped that those who are greedy for profit and disregard the people's food will take this as a warning.</p>
<p>The Poor's Hunger Does Not Choose Food Is Worrying</p>
<p>In the public concession, the area along the river north of Meibai Ge Road and Xin Zha Road is home to many poor people from Jiangbei. Recently, a certain rice shop there has run out of rice, and the shop assistants are watching with folded arms. Another rice shop, due to sufficient capital, sells white rice that is purchased as brown rice and milled by itself. The poor people, fearing that there will be no rice to buy, are competing to buy yellow brown rice from the rice shop at 24 yuan per stone, and at most five dou per person, and not allowed to buy more. From morning to dusk, the threshold is worn through.</p>
<h3>Successful Sino-British Loan Stabilizes Financial Market, New Currency Proven Baseless, Foreign Exchange Eases, Securities Rise</h3>
<p>The Shanghai financial market previously suffered from speculative activity due to rumors of a new currency issuance, leading to a sharp contraction in the black market for foreign exchange, soaring gold prices, declining public bonds, and rising swap premiums. Now, the Ministry of Finance has clarified that the rumors of a new currency issuance are baseless. Simultaneously, China has successfully secured a £3 million commercial credit loan from the United Kingdom, and the agreement has been signed. As a result, the financial market has been invigorated and is trending towards stability. A Xin Sheng News Agency reporter learned from the market yesterday: (1) The official exchange rate at HSBC for the black market for foreign exchange remains unchanged, but the actual market rate has eased and is trending towards stability; (2) The gold black market has stabilized, with smaller fluctuations than in the past. The morning closing price was 4,570 yuan, and the afternoon closing price was 4,560 yuan; (3) In the securities black market, Category A unified bonds rose by 60 cents, Category B by 80 cents, Category C by 70 cents, Category D by 45 cents, and Category E by 50 cents; (4) Swap premiums have slightly decreased, fluctuating between 190 and 195 yuan.</p>
<h3>Central Bank Shanghai Branch Counts New Subsidiary Currency Notes; Issuance and Distribution Exclusively Handled by the Bank, No Longer Distributed by the Tobacco and Money Exchange Associations.</h3>
<p>Returning Substitute Currency Stamps Extremely Difficult</p>
<p>The new subsidiary currency notes that have been delivered to the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank have been counted and verified. The bank is currently drafting regulations on the quota for various industries to exchange the notes. Once decided, the notes will be officially issued and circulated next week. The post-issue management of the stamp issue is pending further discussion.</p>
<p>Newly Arrived Subsidiary Currency Notes Counted and Verified</p>
<p>The bank had previously requested approval from the Chongqing headquarters to issue 500,000 yuan of new subsidiary currency notes in denominations of one fen and five fen, fully backed by 500,000 yuan of legal tender, due to a shortage of copper subsidiary currency in Shanghai. The printing was completed by the American-owned Wing On Company in Hong Kong, and the notes were delivered to Shanghai in full the day before yesterday. It is understood that the Shanghai branch of Wing On Company was responsible for delivering the notes clearly, which were packed in over one hundred boxes. The bank has dispatched personnel to perform a second count over the past two days and handed them over to the National Treasury Bureau for safekeeping. It is expected that the issuance bureau will be able to formally announce and carefully issue the notes in accordance with the instructions next Monday or Tuesday.</p>
<p>Central Bank Shanghai Branch Exclusively Handles Issuance</p>
<p>When the bank issued nickel-copper subsidiary currency in the past, it approved a request from the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, forwarded by the money and tobacco exchange associations, to distribute and exchange the two types of new currency through the two associations in order to thoroughly regulate and evenly distribute them and allow their circulation in the market. Now, the bank considers the situation in Shanghai to be special and has decided to exclusively handle the issuance and distribution rights of the new notes. In the future, it will allow various industries to exchange the notes when necessary. It is also rumored that the money and tobacco exchange associations, having learned that the notes are arriving in Shanghai and will be issued soon, are planning to send personnel to contact the Chamber of Commerce and the bank to request that they continue to use the previous method of exchanging the newly issued notes.</p>
<p>Drafting Quota Regulations for Exchange</p>
<p>The reason for the shortage of copper subsidiary currency in Shanghai is well known to all. Fortunately, various industries have coped effectively, using stamps and substitute currency vouchers to make up for small amounts and resolve the difficulties of circulation. Before the new notes are issued, the bank has been actively drafting quota regulations for various sectors to exchange the new notes, providing them with the most comprehensive convenience based on their respective needs. For example, abnormally large exchange requests will be considered or directly rejected. It is understood that this measure is purely to prevent malicious attempts by unscrupulous individuals in the future. It is expected that once these quota regulations are established, a formal issuance date can be set at any time.</p>
<p>Electric Tram and Bus Vouchers Should Be Immediately Recalled</p>
<p>According to sources in the financial community, when there was a shortage of subsidiary currency, the public tram and bus companies in the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession printed various substitute currency vouchers and copper-aluminum subsidiary currency to pay the change for passengers' tickets. However, the vouchers and coins issued could only be used on trams and buses, which was inconvenient for the general public. Now that the Central Bank has new notes arriving in Shanghai, the two companies should immediately recall all the vouchers and coins they issued previously, so that the currency system can be unified. It is said that the major companies on Nanjing Road have already recalled their substitute currency vouchers and are waiting for the new notes from the Central Bank to circulate in the market.</p>
<p>Post-Issue Management of the Stamp Issue Still Pending</p>
<p>Now that the Central Bank's new notes have arrived in Shanghai and are about to be issued, a spokesperson for the postal service said regarding the issue of recalling 400,000 yuan of stamps: the purchase and use of 400,000 yuan of stamps by various industries was originally a voluntary measure to regulate business needs. Once used and returned, they would inevitably be stained, or unscrupulous individuals might use soapy water to clean used old stamps and mix them in. The postal service has no possibility of recalling them at all. Also, according to Mr. Zha Peilin of the Shanghai Postal Service, stamps purchased for use in the market are difficult to recall according to postal regulations. However, clean and unstained stamps can be used as usual when mailing letters. However, this method has a significant impact on ordinary people, and it is hoped that relevant organizations will consult with the postal service to find a solution to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>
<h3>British People of Justice Once Again Advocate for Four Chinese; Apply for Habeas Corpus in London Court; Judge Approved and Scheduled Interrogation</h3>
<p>(Reuters, Tianjin, 18th) American lawyer Eissan, representing the Ellis &amp; Hays law firm of Shanghai, who was yesterday rejected by the Shanghai British Assize Court in his application for a writ of habeas corpus for four Chinese in Tianjin, visited the four suspects in the assassination case of Cheng today afternoon. The purpose was to seek the four men's commission and affidavits. The meeting lasted forty minutes. Eissan allowed police chief Greenslade to monitor the meeting. Eissan later told people that the four men in custody seemed to be treated appropriately, with two men sharing a cell.</p>
<p>(Havas, London, 18th) Regarding the extradition of the four Chinese suspects in the British Concession in Tianjin, the law firm of Elwell and Flack is asking the High Court for a writ of habeas corpus after Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Halifax recently instructed the Treasury Counsel to state to the court that they accept this procedure.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 17th Regarding the matter of the four Chinese suspects in Tianjin, Professor Benderley of the University of Jerusalem and Ms. Flay, director of the BBC, previously requested the British Consular Court in Shanghai to invoke habeas corpus, but were rejected. Recently, the law firm of Elwell and Flack accepted the commission of Professor Benderley, Ms. Flay, and Lord Lisdowne, chairman of the China Campaign Committee in the United Kingdom, and filed the same request with the court here. Judge Cassels immediately agreed to hear the case and set it for next Thursday (August 24) to hear the lawyers' opinions. If the request is approved, the Foreign Secretary will be informed, who will in turn instruct the Consul General in Tianjin, the Director-General of the Tianjin Municipal Council, and the prison warden to bring the suspects to the British court for trial or release them immediately.</p>
<p>Writ to Be Issued Next Week</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 17th Judge Cassels of the High Court, after hearing the one-sided petition presented in his office today on behalf of the four Chinese suspects currently detained in the British Concession in Tianjin, has approved the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus. The writ will be published on Tuesday and served on Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, British Consul General Jameson in Tianjin, the Director-General of the Tianjin British Concession Municipal Council Thebald, and the Tianjin prison warden.</p>
<p>Separate Petition Filed in Shanghai</p>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reports that regarding the case of the four Chinese suspects detained in the British Concession in Tianjin, the law firm of Elwell and Flack in London has filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus with the court, which is completely identical to the petition filed in Shanghai. The petition filed in Shanghai was rejected in his office yesterday (17th) by Justice Jones of the British Supreme Court for China, but the rejection does not mean that a petition cannot be refiled. In fact, the Ellis &amp; Hays law firm in Shanghai is currently filing another petition for a writ of habeas corpus with Chief Justice Sir Moseley.</p>
<p>Request Can Be Made Even Late at Night</p>
<p>According to speakers, people in danger can apply for this writ at any time and place to any magistrate. For example, nothing can prevent others from filing another petition with Magistrate Jones. Lawyers can even ask a magistrate to get up at two o'clock in the morning to apply for a writ without being hindered. The issuance of a writ in London means that the four people who receive the writ must present their reasons on Tuesday why the writ of habeas corpus does not apply to them. Because the court is on vacation in London, the hearing is held in the office. Traditionally, one vacation judge is appointed each year to handle emergency petitions, so Judge Cassels seems to be serving as the vacation judge this year.</p>
<h3>Difficult Refugee Donations for July</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lodging Industry Association's refugee donations for July ended on the 16th of this month. A total of 208 hotels were assessed according to the 1.5% method, totaling 23,551.20 yuan in national currency. A total of 75 rooming houses donated 2 yuan each per month, totaling 150 yuan. The grand total is 23,701.20 yuan in national currency. The funds have now been paid to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Telegram to the Four Banks: Prohibition of Exchange Rate Discount, Exchange Rate Was Originally Provided for Commercial Collection and Payment, and There is No Need for Exchange Rate Discount</h3>
<p>Because of the surge in exchange rate discounts in this city, affecting legitimate businesses, after a joint letter from various industries was sent to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to forward to the Ministry of Finance for prohibition, the Ministry of Finance has responded to the joint office of the four banks of Zhongzhongjiaonong by telegram, stating that the exchange rate was originally for legitimate commercial collection and payment and there is no need for conversion. As for the exchange rate discount, the headquarters has previously investigated and prohibited it and should be banned. The office should find out the actual situation and take remedial action and prohibit it.</p>

<h3>Handling of Jewish Refugees: Agreement Reached; Those Who Have Already Departed for Shanghai Are Allowed to Land; Restrictions Hereafter; Various Parties Negotiate Detailed Regulations</h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that after a meeting yesterday (17th) between Japanese Consul General Miura, French Consul General Baudic, and Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council Fessenden, a complete agreement has been reached on the procedures to be adopted for the recent announcement that Jewish refugees will no longer be allowed to come to Shanghai. Fessenden stated when he received news reporters yesterday afternoon that the views of the three authorities are all that the refugees who</p>
<p>Land Ban</p>
<p>Had already boarded ships for Shanghai at the time of the announcement should be allowed to land, and that those who left Europe within a reasonable period after the announcement should also be allowed to reside here. Therefore, Jewish refugees who boarded ships in Genoa, Marseille, and Hamburg on the 15th, 16th, and 18th of this month will be allowed to land and reside in Hongkou, or any part of the Public or French Concessions. Fessenden continued that our decision will determine</p>
<p>Who Can Come</p>
<p>To Shanghai, or who cannot. Therefore, representatives of the three authorities have formed a committee that will draft detailed regulations that clearly distinguish who will be considered refugees and who will not. The committee will hold its first meeting today (18th), or</p>
<p>Refuse Bookings</p>
<p>Ship tickets. The work of drafting detailed regulations will begin as quickly as possible. All three parties are aware that many of the refugees already in Shanghai are hoping that members of their families will come to Shanghai in the future, and we can assure them that the authorities will give this the most sympathetic consideration.</p>
<h3>Anti-British Leaflets Issued Again in the Western District</h3>
<p>The English-language *China Press* reports that today (18th) morning, Japanese soldiers distributed anti-British leaflets outside the Western District. Anti-British posters were also pasted on the walls and fences of houses along Hongqiao Road.</p>
<h3>Japan Firmly Denies Bombing of British Property in Yichang, Claims Chinese Military Buildings Are Near British Property; Demands Evidence that British Ship Was Bombed</h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that Yichang was bombed twice on the 6th of this month, and the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s *Hsinchanghwa* was hit by a shell, which immediately caught fire and was destroyed along with *Kiaohwa*. The Asiatic Petroleum Company's property was also severely damaged. Mr. Tang Yat, the first mate of *Hsinchanghwa*, was injured, and two Chinese crew members were killed and three injured. Rear Admiral Holt, commander of the British Yangtze Fleet, lodged two protests that day. According to a statement made by the Japanese side at a press conference yesterday (17th), the Japanese military authorities</p>
<p>Received the Protest, and after completing the investigation, Consul General Miura in Shanghai sent a letter to Consul General Phillips in Shanghai for transfer to the British Consul General in Hankou. The letter denies that Japanese aircraft bombed Yichang twice on the 6th of this month and destroyed two ships of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and the property of Asiatic Petroleum Co. It also claims that on the 6th of this month, the Japanese Air Force bombed</p>
<p>Large Quantities of Military Equipment</p>
<p>and ammunition stored by the Chinese army approximately four kilometers southeast of Yichang. Prior notice was given to strictly avoid damaging the property of third countries around Guanchang. On the day of the two bombings, the first bombing targeted the military equipment and ammunition southeast by east of the Asiatic Petroleum Company's storage depot. Heavy anti-aircraft fire from the vicinity of Yichang was encountered, and some aircraft were shaken by the explosions of shells, and the fuselage of the aircraft was penetrated by shrapnel. However, according to the report of the commander of the air force and the staff officers who accompanied the observation, it is clear that no bombs fell on the Asiatic Petroleum Company's oil storage depot or hit</p>
<p>Third-Country Ships</p>
<p>However, three shells fell near the ship berthed at the southeast corner of the oil depot, so it is possible that crew members were injured by shrapnel. During the second bombing, the commander and staff officers did not see any bombs hitting the property of third countries, nor did they see any ships being bombed and catching fire. If a British ship was burned, it must have been at other times and for other reasons. It is regrettable if bombs fell on the Asiatic Petroleum Company or caused</p>
<p>British Crew Members</p>
<p>to be injured. If this happened, it was because the Chinese military buildings were close to British property. Such unfortunate incidents must be unavoidable. If it is said that the British ship caught fire as a result of the bombing, please provide evidence to the Japanese military authorities.</p>
<h3>Japanese *Izumo* Shifts Berth, Intention Unclear; Originally Moored at Mitsubishi Wharf on the Riverfront, Now Moored at China Merchants Wharf</h3>
<p>The flagship *Izumo* of the Japanese Navy's Third Fleet, after returning to Shanghai on the 14th, remained moored at the Mitsubishi Wharf next to the Japanese Consulate north of the Garden Bridge. Yesterday morning, it suddenly shifted berth to the China Merchants Wharf to the north. It is not known what the intention is.</p>
<h3>Steel Rails of the South Railway Station Actually Removed by the Japanese Side; A Total of Seven Kilometers to Laolonghua; All Dismantled Section by Section and Loaded to Hongkou</h3>
<p>The buildings of the Shanghai South Railway Station of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway were almost completely destroyed after being bombed. Recently, the Japanese side hired a large number of ignorant workers to dismantle all the steel rails of the railway, including the main and branch lines, from the Shanghai Military Camp Chaozhou Wuyi Shanzhuang coal and fuel depot branch line, the cargo depot branch lines on both sides of the north and south sides of the station, and the main line from the South Station, directly to Hangzhou, along Xizha, Dapuqiao, Guonei Wai Rihui Port, to Laolonghua Station. The dismantled rails were transported to Hongkou by truck. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway South Station extends seven kilometers west to Laolonghua, which is equivalent to eleven Chinese miles.</p>
<h3>Rumor that Chang Yuqing Was Shot and Killed in Nanjing</h3>
<p>The *North-China Daily News* reports that a Nanjing native spoke to a certain Chinese news agency that Chang Yuqing, a pro-Japanese rogue, was shot and killed by seven Chinese in Nanjing on the eve of August 13. The seven men fought with Chang's bodyguards and were also killed. The Japanese puppet government is keeping the shooting a secret, so the details are unknown. However, the Nanjing native is certain that Chang is dead. According to reports, many of the terrorists under Chang's direction have been sentenced to heavy penalties by the Special Court. The targets of these attacks were mostly government agencies and pro-Chinese government newspapers, radio stations, and individuals. After being arrested, they admitted that they were instructed by Chang and paid to commit acts of terrorism. The Public Security Bureau of the Public Concession issued an arrest warrant, but Chang could not gain a foothold in Shanghai and fled to Nanjing. It is rumored that he has formed another gang and came to Shanghai a few months ago to recruit disciples.</p>
<h3>Inspection of Exchange Rate Preparation; Committee Begins Inspection; Announcement Will Be Made After Completion</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silver and Money Exchange Association, in order to regulate the funds of fellow traders and assist industry and commerce, has been handling the acquisition of exchange rate since July 4. All firms and banks have provided assets as preparation to be presented at the bank exchange rate in order to obtain circulation in the market. Since the implementation, industry and commerce</p>
<p>Gradually Becoming More Flexible</p>
<p>The association has established an evaluation committee, which assigns groups to evaluate the value at any time, stipulating that it must not exceed 70% of the value of the collateral. If the market price falls,</p>
<p>Collateral Will Be Pursued</p>
<p>At the same time, the Exchange Rate Preparation Inspection Committee for the Money and Silver Industry Association was established. The association has held its first committee meeting to implement the inspection of exchange rate preparation by fellow traders. Commissioners Xu Jilao, Wu Yunzhai, Qin Runqing, Hu Meian, and He Bosi</p>
<p>Designated Personnel</p>
<p>Started the inspection yesterday. Once the inspection is completed, the number of acquisitions and the type and number of collateral will be announced separately in order to show credibility.</p>
<h3>British Ship Requests Armed Protection; British Troops May Board Ship; To Be Implemented When Necessary</h3>
<p>The *Continental Times* reports that it was learned yesterday (17th) from responsible parties that several ships here have requested to increase the armed guards on British coastal ships. Although there have been no reports of pirate activity for a long time, the request for guards is mostly to protect ships and deal with pirates. It is heard that some people have requested the British Consulate in Shanghai to allow an increase in protection, but inquiries at the shipping department of the British Consulate failed to obtain any information. According to a spokesperson for a certain shipping company, British commercial companies hire their own guards. If the British Consul approves the request, the only way to help is to send British troops to board the ship. However, this kind of action will not be taken unless there is an unusually serious danger. Both Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire currently hire their own armed guards, stationed on all coastal ships. Jardine Matheson's ships sailing between Shanghai and the ports of South China each carry six armed Chinese and one Russian. Ships sailing north along the coast each have four Russian guards.</p>
<h3>Newly Recruited Postal Workers to Be Assigned to Various Provinces in Southwest China; Service Location Can Be Designated; Branch Offices to Be Added to New Transportation Lines</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Ministry of Communications authorities have been actively promoting transportation construction in various provinces in Southwest China, sparing no effort. At present, the aviation and highway network has been largely completed. In order to meet the needs of the interior and develop postal services in various provinces and cities, the Shanghai Postal Administration was ordered to recruit new postal workers. The Shanghai Bureau held an examination after receiving the order and recruited more than 200 people. A six-month internship period is planned. According to inquiries with the postal service, men account for 70% and women account for 30% of the newly recruited personnel, all of whom are educated. The personnel have been assigned by Mr. Zha Peilin to rotate through the designated post offices in this city for internships to observe the necessary work in postal services. After the six-month internship period is over, the newly recruited postal workers will be assigned by the Shanghai Bureau to serve in the postal bureaus of Yunnan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Hunan, Sichuan, and other provinces. According to a postal service spokesperson speaking to the Da Guang News Agency yesterday, many of the newly recruited personnel are postal assistants who have served in the postal service. After being recruited, the cost of travel to the places they will be assigned to in the future will be provided by the government. The location of service can be designated by the postal workers in advance. Most of the newly organized bureaus are on newly built highways or newly opened airline routes, handling all domestic and foreign postal services.</p>

<h3>Why Are Married Female Employees Being Dismissed?</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has always employed many female employees, whether married or unmarried, who have been able to perform their duties diligently. Recently, the bureau suddenly wanted to follow the customs practice of dismissing married female employees. The entire female staff of the bureau was panicked after hearing the news, because if this method were implemented, not only would the lives of the female employees of the bureau be greatly threatened, but the future of women's careers would also be greatly hindered. They have now jointly requested the bureau to withdraw its order. All sectors are paying close attention to this matter, and various women's organizations have agreed to be concerned and are planning to provide assistance.</p>
<h3>Columbia Restricts Delivery of Plant Seedlings; Must Have Certificate from Country of Origin; Otherwise, All Mail Will Be Destroyed</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1565 states that "Pursuant to a letter from the International Postal Union stating that 'Pursuant to a letter from the Postal Service of the Republic of Colombia stating that 'Any plant seedlings, etc., used for propagation, such as seeds, bulbs, scions, rhizomes, grafts, etc., sent to that country must be accompanied by a certificate of disease-free from the health authority of the country of origin, and a permit from the Ministry of Economy of that country. If the above certificates, etc., are not attached, the relevant mail will be destroyed. Please check accordingly, etc.'", This is hereby notified to the public.</p>
<h3>When Speakers Refer to Leaders, Gathering Participants Must Sit Still; All Sectors at Home and Abroad Should Pay Attention; No Need to Stand Up to Avoid Disparities</h3>
<p>It is already well known and has been practiced for a long time that every time a speaker first refers to the Premier or the President in various gatherings or classrooms, those at ease must stand at attention. For groups sitting in classrooms listening to lectures or sitting in auditoriums holding meetings, whether they should all stand up every time a speaker first refers to the Premier, President, or Chairman, or whether they should only sit still, has not been clearly stipulated, resulting in inconsistent sitting and standing and disparate order. The Central Executive Committee, based on the request of the Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters, has stipulated that "Whenever speakers refer to the Premier, President or Chairman, or Chief of the military, the gathering of party members must stand at attention instead of sitting down, so as to show the party's great respect to the leaders". It has been notified that "All groups sitting in classrooms listening to lectures or sitting in auditoriums holding meetings should, as in the case of party and government training classes, sit still instead of standing up every time the first speaker refers to the Premier, President, or Chairman." All levels of party headquarters at home and abroad are hereby notified to inform their subordinates to pay attention.</p>

<h3>Danish Man Krogh Assassinated by Thugs; Dies from Three Gunshot Wounds; Public Believes Case is of Great Importance</h3>
<p>Peter Krogh, a Danish man who was the business manager of the Great Northern Telegraph Company and the captain of Company A of the Shanghai International Settlement Volunteer Corps, was suddenly shot and assassinated yesterday morning by thugs. Krogh was 39 years old, born in 1900 in Jutland, Denmark. He was transferred to Shanghai by the Great Northern Telegraph Company in 1928. Krogh's wife is British, and they have a 12-year-old son who is currently on summer vacation with his mother in Beidaihe. Krogh's residence in Shanghai was No. 91 Anhe Temple Road, where he owned a car that he drove himself. At around 8:20 AM yesterday morning, Krogh drove the car out of the garage. As he was turning the car around, two Chinese men wearing Western suits, glasses, and permed hair walked up to the right side of the car and appeared to be asking Krogh a question, inquiring if he was indeed Krogh. Krogh responded, but immediately after he finished speaking, the two Chinese men pulled out handguns and fired several shots at Krogh. At the time, Krogh was sitting in the car, holding the steering wheel, unable to evade. He was hit by three bullets in the chest and arm, and collapsed in the car. The two thugs, seeing their objective had been achieved, calmly fled. At this moment, Krogh's servant heard the noise and came out to investigate, witnessing his master's attack. He immediately reported to the nearby police station and telegraphed the Jing'an Temple Police Station, ordering them to dispatch a large number of detectives. By the time they arrived, Krogh was barely breathing and the perpetrators were long gone. They rushed Krogh to Hong'en Hospital for treatment, but by the time they arrived at the hospital, he was already dead. The body was then transferred to the International Funeral Parlor on Jiaozhou Road. The police thoroughly investigated the scene of the incident, but found no clues. At the same time, the police authorities have paid close attention since receiving this report. According to the English-language "North China Daily News," Krogh, Holper Peter Krogh, a 39-year-old employee of the Great Northern Telegraph Company, was assassinated by two Chinese men at Anhe Temple Road at 8:20 AM this morning (the 18th).</p>
<p>Assassination</p>
<p>It has been found that Krogh was the person identified in the Japanese press as the one who tore down the Five-Colored Flag of the "Avenue Police Station" near Great Western Road and Columbia Road early one morning. Many believe that this matter may be related to the murder case. The details are as follows: Krogh left his residence at No. 91 Anhe Temple Road at 8:20 AM this morning. As soon as he got into his car, two Chinese men came forward and spoke to him. Krogh got out of the car to</p>
<p>Inquire</p>
<p>One of the two Chinese men, speaking in English, asked, "Are you Mr. Krogh?" Krogh answered yes. The two Chinese men said nothing more and immediately pulled out their guns and shot directly at Krogh. Krogh was hit by three bullets, one entering his chest from his right armpit, and two hitting his arm, causing him to fall to the ground. The two thugs immediately fled. A Chinese police officer a short distance away heard the gunshots and rushed to the scene, but the thugs had already escaped. He then</p>
<p>Reported to the Police</p>
<p>To the Jing'an Temple Police Station. A large number of police officers rushed to the scene. By the time they arrived, Krogh had lost consciousness. They summoned an ambulance and transported him to Hong'en Hospital, but he died en route. The body was then moved to the International Funeral Parlor. Detectives searched the area near the scene for witnesses and clues, but found very little. They are currently thoroughly investigating this matter, but feel it will be difficult. It is said that Krogh had no enemies in Shanghai. No further information is available, but this assassination case may possibly be traced to</p>
<p>Flag</p>
<p>Incident. Several weeks ago, a Japanese newspaper reported that at 4:00 AM one morning, Krogh drove his car to the newly reopened "Avenue Police Station" near Great Western Road and Columbia Road, took down the Five-Colored Flag and trampled on it. Krogh, the Great Northern Telegraph Company, and the Danish Consul all strongly denied this. Later, signs indicated that someone else may have</p>
<p>Cut</p>
<p>The flagpole rope, but it was not done by Krogh, and there was no evidence of trampling on the flag. However, many believe that a "bad element" from a terrorist group used this incident as an excuse to assassinate Krogh, hoping to intimidate foreigners in Shanghai in general. Krogh previously worked at the Great Northern Telegraph Company in Denmark. He came to Shanghai in 1928. Before his assassination, he was the</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>Of the business department of Great Northern Telegraph Company and the captain of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps "A" Team. His wife and 12-year-old son are currently residing in Beidaihe. Funeral arrangements have not yet been finalized, but it is believed that the Danish Consul in Shanghai will request a military funeral.</p>
<h3>Case of Robbing a Police Detective's Gun: Court Receives Anonymous Letter Claiming Bribery of Judge and Detectives; Defendant Denies and Court Orders Verdict to be Announced Later</h3>
<p>Tong Longhua, a native of Zhenjiang who is the owner of the Fu Tai Egg Shop at No. 285 Caishi Street in the French Concession, detained Lu Axiang's bicycle on the 7th of this month for failure to pay off the debt. Lu had to pay off the debt before the bicycle will be returned. Lu reported this to the police station, who dispatched Detective Wu Wengang to the Fu Tai Egg Shop to order the return of the bicycle. The shop assistant Ni Baosheng mistakenly thought that Lu Axiang had colluded with thugs to make trouble. Ni ordered the shop's accountant and old staff to surround and beat Detective Wu, and stole Wu's official handgun. Wu reported this to the police chief, who dispatched detectives to arrest the shop owner Tong Longhua, Ni Baosheng, the old staff Tang Amao, Qiu Runan, Yang Sanlang, and the accountant Yang Shangzhen, a total of six people, and sent them to the First Special Court. Judge Qiu ordered Ni Baosheng to be detained for further investigation and interrogation, and the others were each released on bail of 300 yuan with a shop as guarantor. Later, Ni was also granted bail of 500 yuan with a shop as guarantor. Yesterday morning, Judge Qiu opened the court for continued hearing. The defendants hired lawyer Wu Peng to defend them. The police lawyer Chen Ming presented the case and prosecuted according to the law. Detective Wu Wengang testified about being beaten and his gun stolen. When questioned, the defendants all denied the allegations. The court reviewed the testimonies and ordered a debate. The hearing was adjourned and the verdict was set to be announced on the 25th. The defendants remained on their original bail. The court also said to the defendants, "This court has received a letter stating that you spent 2,500 yuan, 1,000 yuan to this court, 1,000 yuan to the police detectives, and 500 yuan to the police lawyer. This court handles matters impartially and does not need money. If you were foolish and spent money, you should get it back immediately, or else I will prosecute according to the law." After the judge finished speaking, the court was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Judgment Against the Romantic Thief Jiang Jianqiu; Jiang Prepares to Appeal</h3>
<p>The romantic thief Jiang Jianqiu was sentenced to five years in prison by the First Special Court and nine years in prison by the Second Special Court for several dozen cases of enticing prostitutes, dancers, female guides, female opera singers, and wealthy mistresses to steal their property, as well as theft and robbery of other people's money and clothing. Jiang expressed his willingness to accept the judgment of the First Special Court, but was unwilling to accept the judgment of the Second Special Court. On the 10th of this month, he sent a letter from the Second Special Court Detention Center to his defending lawyer Zhang Danping, asking him to</p>
<p>Draft a Petition</p>
<p>To file an appeal to the Third Branch of the High Court. The written judgment of the Second Special Court sentencing Jiang to nine years in prison has already been delivered. Jiang has received the written judgment and has given it to lawyer Zhang for review. The original text of the written judgment is recorded below: "Defendant Jiang Jianqiu, male, 26 years old, from Nanchang, unemployed, residing at No. 12 Lafayete Road, Lafayete Fang. The right defendant has been prosecuted by the French Concession authorities for crimes such as robbery, and this court has ruled as follows: Judgment: Jiang Jianqiu is a recidivist for robbery committed by a group of three or more persons and is sentenced to</p>
<p>Nine years of imprisonment. Other parts are dismissed. Facts: On March 7th of this year at 8:30 AM, Jiang Jianqiu, together with fugitives Wang Ziming and Ding San, robbed Shen Tao of a rectangular gold-plated watch on Fada Road. On March 9th at 9:20 PM, they again robbed Huang Chen of a gold rectangular watch on Min體尼蔭 Road. On March 29th at 8:00 PM, they again robbed Sun Chen of a gold watch on Weiermeng Road, Ailaige Road. In addition, there are more than ten other criminal cases, one for fraud and one for theft. Later, due to</p>
<p>Committing another crime</p>
<p>He was arrested by the Public Concession Police Station. The Shanghai First Special District Local Court punished him for continuous theft and continuous fraud. After his judgment, the French Concession authorities requested that he be transferred back to their custody for investigation and prosecution. Reasons: The case is discussed as follows: (1) Robbery Part The defendant Jiang Jianqiu does not admit to robbing Shen Tao, Huang Chen, and Sun Chen's watches. Huang Chen has also come to court to clearly identify him. Considering the facts, they are consistent and can be identified. According to the defense, one person robbed and his friends kept watch. The so-called friends refer to Ding San and Wang Ziming.</p>
<p>The so-called keeping watch means sharing a part of the crime. Later, they firmly claimed that they did not know that I was robbing, avoiding the serious and emphasizing the light, so they want to be released. The circumstances are obvious. His actions constitute robbery committed by a group of three or more persons with the intention of illegally possessing other people's movable property, and should be punished severely for robbery. As far as his repeated implementation of robbery is concerned, it is based on a single intentional activity, repeated several times, and constitutes the same nature of crime, and should be treated as a continuous crime. It has been found that the defendant has been sentenced to imprisonment for theft</p>
<p>Execution Completed</p>
<p>For not more than five years, he has now committed another crime punishable by imprisonment for more than five years and should be given an additional one-half of the sentence. (2) Theft and Fraud Parts, according to the provisions of Article 56 of the Criminal Law, the former paragraph, it is clearly stated that those who repeatedly commit the same crime in several acts are treated as one crime. In this case, the defendant Jiang Jianqiu, within the jurisdiction of the First Special District and the Second Special District, continuously stole other people's movable property and continuously used fraud to make people hand over property based on a single intentional activity. The Shanghai First Special District Local Court has already made a final judgment in accordance with the law. Considering the continuous crimes</p>
<p>Treated as One Crime</p>
<p>Regulations, the continuous theft and continuous fraud committed in the area under the jurisdiction of this court are of course included, and it is not appropriate to impose another crime. Regarding this part, an acquittal should be announced. Based on the above conclusions, the judgment should be made in accordance with Article 291, former paragraph, of the Criminal Procedure Law, Article 56, former paragraph, Article 326, paragraph 1, Article 325, paragraph 1, Article 321, paragraph 1, item 4, Article 47, Article 294, paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, as per the main text. July 27, 28th year of the Republic of China, Jiangsu Shanghai Second Special District Local Court Criminal Tribunal Judge Qiu Huan Ying (seal). After reviewing the written judgment, lawyer Zhang, in addition to first declaring an appeal in accordance with the law, is now drafting the grounds for appeal on behalf of Jiang.

<h3>Two Chinese Police Officers Falsely Claim Loot</h3>
<p>Two Chinese police officers, No. 143 from the Avenue Joffre Police Station and No. 173 from the Xiaodongmen Police Station, used a pawn ticket for a straw hat from the Tongfu Pawn Shop on Avenue Ailaige the other day, posing as French Police Detective Wang Dongwan, claiming to be collecting stolen goods from the pawn shop. When the shop clerk checked the ticket, he found that the ticket had already been reported lost and redeemed. The two police officers then started yelling and threatening to take the shop clerk to the police station unless they were given a considerable reward. The pawn shop felt that detectives never behaved this way when collecting stolen goods, so they secretly reported to the police station, which sent detectives to investigate. They found that the two police officers were falsely claiming to be detectives for fraudulent purposes and took them both to the police station. After being interrogated by the police chief, they were ordered to be detained for further investigation.</p>

Afterwards, the local Western newspapers all reported on the firefighter's bravery and praised him highly. Just the other day, a certain Western woman, under her own name, sent a letter to the French Concession Fire Department to thank the firefighter for the raccoon cat. The letter included five yuan in French currency as a reward and requested that if the raccoon cat was kept at the Fire Department, she would personally come to collect it and raise it carefully, as she had deep sympathy for this pitiful animal.</p>

However, a rascal named Liu Shande, a native of Anhui, 30 years old, saw the newspaper report and forged business cards of Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Pan Gongzhan, the director of the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs. On the 10th, he visited Zhou Junxian's home, claiming that he was currently working in the interior for the government and had recently been sent to Shanghai from Hong Kong on official business. He claimed that he had run out of travel expenses and could not return to Hong Kong, so he came to ask for a loan for travel expenses. He also showed the business cards of Wang and Pan, which also stated that Liu was in Shanghai on official business, had run out of travel expenses, and had come to ask for a loan. After listening to Liu's words, Zhou asked about the whereabouts and recent situation of Wang and Pan. Liu stared blankly and could not answer. Zhou knew that Liu was impersonating and defrauding, so he reported to the French Police Station to arrest Liu. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the Second Special Court, requesting</p>
<p>Detention Pending Further Investigation</p>
<p>To investigate whether he had committed other crimes and request an interrogation. After Judge Qiu's interrogation, it was approved to postpone the investigation and interrogation. Liu Shande was detained.</p>

<p>Walking towards him</p>
<p>They greeted each other, talked, and walked together, crossing the wooden bridge over Xiaobeihang and reaching the north of the creek. Unexpectedly, Jin Dama Pi pulled out a gun and fired three shots at Guo, hitting him in the head, neck, and lungs. Guo Jingen was severely wounded and tried to escape, but he was too weak from his injuries. He ran to the front of No. 158 Caojiazhai, and</p>
<p>Fell Dead</p>
<p>The murderer escaped. Later, after the deceased's family received the news, they went to collect the body.

<h3>Henan Wartime Education Facilities (Part 1)</h3>
<p>(Nanyang Correspondence) Concerning the relocation and facilities of secondary schools during wartime education in Henan, as previously reported, the situation regarding educational facilities at all levels in the province during wartime is detailed below:</p>
<p>Primary and Secondary Education</p>
<p>In addition to encouraging middle school students to join the military and recommending them to the Central Military Academy in seven batches, totaling 753 students, two batches of aviation students, totaling 185, and one batch of aerial survey students, totaling 178, for a total of 1,116 people. Assisting various units in recruiting over 1,300 cadre personnel, organizing and training secondary and higher education students for wartime service, totaling over 1,600 high school and above students. Provincial and county primary schools uniformly established Boy Scout troops, implemented scout training, and held drills to promote children's health and group spirit. Regarding student loans in the war zone, "8 yuan per month for university students (one-third from the Ministry of Education, two-thirds from the province), 5 yuan per month for provincial middle school students, 2 yuan and 5 jiao per month for private middle school students (the remaining half issued by the school)," the amount requested reached 2,000 people, with an annual expenditure of 120,000 yuan. This loan is only enough for food; there is no source for books and uniforms. It is further stipulated that 60% of the neediest students in the entire war zone will be selected, with 10 yuan per term for senior high school and 8 yuan for junior high school, averaging an annual need of 24,000 yuan. As for the "Registration of Students in the War Zone," since September 1937 to the present, 564 students from Beiping and Tianjin have been registered, and 763 students from the province's war zone have been registered. All have been properly placed. The "Registration of Educators Withdrawing from the War Zone," the first batch, based on the Ministry's order in January 1938, handled the registration of educators from various provinces, including Beiping, Tianjin, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi, totaling 79 qualified primary and secondary school educators. The second batch, in April 1938, handled the registration of educators in the province's war zone, totaling 135 qualified individuals. The third time, in June, registration of educators continued in Wan, totaling 429 arrivals. The fourth batch, in December, registration offices were established in Wan, Luo, and Changchuan. By the end of April of this year, a total of 19 qualified middle school teachers and 40 primary school teachers had been registered. All personnel registered in the four batches have been given relief or placement.</p>
<p>Social Education</p>
<p>Supplementary education for out-of-school citizens, as stipulated by the Central Government, is to be completed from 1936 to December 1941. Due to lack of funds, this province did not begin implementation until November 1937. The implementation details are as follows: (1) "Funding": In 1937, the Central Government subsidized textbooks with 19,000 yuan from provincial special education funds, 53,200 yuan from county funds, and 345,600 yuan raised by the people. In the second half of 1938, the budget was extended according to the 1937 budget. In 1939, each county uniformly increased its budget by 1,200 yuan compared to the previous year. (2) "Establishing Schools": It is stipulated that first-class counties have 40 schools, second-class counties have 30 schools, and third-class counties have 20 schools, with half being independent private schools and half being jointly established private schools, totaling 2,880 schools throughout the province. Each school can run four classes per year, with 50 people per class, totaling 576,000 illiterate people to be eliminated from November 1937 to December 1938. According to the original plan, each county was to uniformly increase by 20 schools in 1939. Due to the impact of the war and the Yellow River disaster, it was decided that non-war zone counties would uniformly increase by 10 schools, while counties close to the war zone would continue to operate according to the number of schools established in 1937. If there are real difficulties, appropriate reductions may be made. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Finance Cash Situation Slightly Clarified</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash market was turbulent, but as foreign exchange fluctuations decreased, the chaotic cash market situation gradually disappeared. The high-low difference on the day was less than 100 yuan. If foreign exchange stabilizes in the future, it will soon return to normal. Initially, due to strong foreign exchange quotes and reports that Britain would provide economic aid to China, there was a strong selling trend. A certain gold firm acted on behalf of speculators to sell off, and the market opened down to 4,530 yuan. Later, it continued to fall to 4,510 yuan. Around 10 AM, it was heard that the foreign exchange trend was weakening. Sellers were temporarily waiting, and Hong Kong brokers, who were operating in the market, bought up prices. Outsiders were also interested in buying. Therefore, the market turned strong and rose sharply to a high of 4,590 yuan. Afterwards, the selling intentions of a certain gold firm revived, and silver firms also frequently sold. In addition, foreign exchange stabilized, causing the rising trend to stagnate. In the afternoon, it once again fell to 4,520 yuan. Afterwards, as retail investors were good at buying low prices, the market rebounded to close at 4,560 yuan. As a result, it fell by 5 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was still active, with more than 1,000 taels changing hands. Gold ornaments in silver firms first rose and then fell, with no net change. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold remained unchanged.</p>

Afterwards, securities firms bought 30 taels from gold firms at a price that was raised by 10 yuan to 4,540 yuan. After that, sellers came to sell again because they heard that foreign exchange was continuing to strengthen. Soon, it fell by 30 yuan again. Money changers traded 10 taels with each other at a price of 4,510 yuan. At 10:20 AM, it was heard that foreign exchange was becoming tighter due to the daily buying.

Therefore, the situation reversed and rose. Before long, it rose by 70 yuan. Silver firms traded 50 taels with each other at a price of 4,540 yuan. Later, it once fell slightly to 4,565 yuan, but soon a certain silver firm and money changer came to buy again, and it rose by 25 yuan again. Money changers bought 20 taels from cash gold firms at a price of 4,590 yuan. Later, it was heard that foreign exchange was stabilizing, and selling sentiment arose again.

Near noon, it rebounded again. Securities firms bought 10 taels from cash gold firms at 4,570 yuan as the noon closing price.

Money changers traded 20 taels with each other at a price of 4,520 yuan. At that time, a certain silver firm was actively buying on behalf of outsiders, and retail investors also came to buy again, so the price turned up again. Before long, it soared by 50 yuan. Money changers bought 30 taels from a certain firm at a price of 4,570 yuan. Afterwards, a certain gold firm sold 30 taels to money changers again for 4,560 yuan as the evening closing price.

<p>Sino-British Pure Gold Remained Unchanged</p>
<p>London, 17th The price of British pure gold remained at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 7 pence per ounce. As a result, the market prices of the Central Bank remained stagnant.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Mediocre</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market situation. The HSBC listing was announced, and there was no change. The situation in the unofficial British and American exchange markets was very stable, and the fluctuations also narrowed, hovering above the closing price of the previous night. Initially, because Chinese cotton yarn firms and other speculators frequently sold off British and American exchange, the situation was stable and strong. But at that time, remittances were slightly interested in buying. Around 10 AM, the Japanese Zhengjin suddenly took advantage of the cheap prices to buy, and the market situation turned weak. At noon, the Japanese bank had stopped buying and was waiting, and the situation was even more flat. In the afternoon, the trend became increasingly mediocre, but the Western firm Sassoon came to buy the September futures of the American exchange. As a result, the spot market closed at 3 shillings, 4375 British pounds and 6 yuan, 6875 American dollars. The August and September futures also followed the same step, finally British slightly longer .03125, American slightly stronger .0625. The day's trading was very flat due to the majority of operators waiting.</p>

After that, cotton yarn firms sold spot British pounds to HSBC at 3 shillings, 46875. Then, they sold spot American exchange to a certain bank at 6 yuan, 6875 and 75. At that time, a certain bank absorbed 6 yuan, 5625 American dollars and 3 shillings, 40625 British pounds of this month's American dollars from Chinese merchants. The process was stable and strong. At 10:20 AM, the Japanese bank suddenly came to buy spot American exchange from foreign firms at 6 yuan, 6875 and September American exchange at 5 yuan, 75. Therefore, the situation returned to flat. At that time, the selling price of British pounds by foreign firms was only 3 shillings, 3 shillings and .0625, and the selling price of American exchange was only 6 yuan, 625. Near noon, the selling intention of foreign firms seemed to be slightly stronger.

<h3>Gold Pounds Strong, American Dollar Rises by 3 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the supply of foreign British and American gold pounds was not smooth, and the market was strong. It was said that American gold pounds were the most popular. The supply and demand of British and American gold bills were very strong. However, due to the easing of foreign exchange, the market was slightly soft. The supply and demand of Hong Kong and French tickets were relatively rare, and the market was stable. The circulation of Singapore and Dutch tickets was rare, and the market price was slightly high. There was a lot of supply of Annam tickets, and the market was soft. The demand for Japanese gold tickets was relatively weak, and the market was slightly soft, with the evening market at 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 7 fen and 5 li. The supply of Korean tickets was abundant, and the market price decreased slightly, with the evening market at 9 jiao and 8 fen and 5 li. Other currencies were relatively stable and did not change.

<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Slightly Rises, Foreign Stocks Turn Weak</h3>
<p>Securities grey market: Yesterday's market trend, which had been weak, suddenly reversed, and sentiment seemed more excited. However, the situation felt weak, and the foundation still felt unstable, as it was only covering short positions and there were no new long positions. The reason for the rise was said to be the establishment of the Sino-British loan, but in reality, the rise was still due to the covering of short positions on the surface. Rumors that the gold traders were buying slightly were probably not true. It may be that retail investors temporarily went long, and the covering of short positions initially slightly raised the market price. Therefore, the opening price immediately rose by half a yuan. Yue Mao Ding Kang and Lian He and others all had buying interest, but Hong Kang and Da Kang both continued to sell, and the rising trend was immediately frustrated. As a result, prices recovered by 4.5 to 8 jiao. The total transaction volume was 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below:</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Guohua Bank were traded at a price of 39 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<p>The Public Exchange reported that foreign exchange trends were easing, and news from around the world was divergent and unstable, which was a powerful factor in the stock market decline yesterday. Few stocks were able to maintain their previous day's rise without wavering. Even the rubber market gave way. The most common trade was in British-Java shares at prices ranging from 28 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen to 28 yuan and 7 jiao and 5 fen, which were quite actively traded, indicating a softening market. Among industrial stocks, public transport and tram stocks were the most affected. The former traded at a new low of 20 yuan. Among bonds, the electricity bond was more prominent, and the transaction price was still 73 yuan. At the close, there were sellers at the same price.</p>
<p>The British manager of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and the Gonghexiang Wharf Co., Ltd., decided at yesterday's board meeting to pay an interim dividend of 10 yuan per share in national currency for 1939, starting on August 30. Stock transfers will also be suspended from August 23 to August 30.</p>
<p>The London Eastern companies' stock market prices for the 17th of this month (Thursday) saw a slight decline in HSBC shares. Shares registered in England fell by half a pound to 72 pounds and 50 pence, and shares registered in Hong Kong fell by one pound to 75 pounds. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>London Chinese foreign debt market prices for the 17th of this month (Thursday): Various government bonds at the high and low ends remained stable and unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Fabric: Hong Kong Traders Exclusively Handle 20-Count Double Horse Yarn, Spot Goods All Bought Up, High Price Seen Again at 773 Yuan</h3>
<p>The rising trend in the yarn market has reignited, driven by real demand development. Traders from South China, Hong Kong, and Yunnan are actively purchasing coarse and fine yarns, which has boosted market sentiment. Hong Kong traders are particularly keen on 20-count Double Horse yarn, and are willing to buy all that is available. As a result, buying prices are rising, and the upward momentum is particularly strong. Other brands are suffering from lagging sales and remain in a stable to soft position. The high price of 20-count Double Horse yarn has repeatedly broken records, and a new record of 773 yuan has been seen. In this situation, 20-count Double Earth and Angel yarns seem relatively cheap.</p>
<p>The opening price of yarn this morning rose by five yuan because of the development of customer sales channels and the buying interest from Yunnan and Hong Kong traders. The market looked tight. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 757 yuan, and the factory price was 695 yuan. Soon after, it was heard that Guangdong traders were specifically buying Double Horse yarn, which further boosted market sentiment, and prices were raised step by step. The best price was 773 yuan, up 16 yuan from the opening price. However, there was no major activity for other yarns, and the prices were more moderate. The closing price was flat. It is estimated that a total of 1,405 bales were bought by various traders in the first half of the day. On the 19th, 60 pieces of yarn were shipped to Hong Kong, 10 pieces to Saigon, and 27 pieces to Siam. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was good at 21 yuan, Special Golden City rose 5 yuan, Shepherd rose 7 yuan, and the factories remained inactive. The amount of yarn bought by various traders is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 675 Fellow Traders 175</p>
<p>Mainland 125 Yunnan 410</p>

<h3>Proposed Increase in Cotton Prices, Industry Reluctant to Sell Cotton</h3>
<p>The trading of Chinese and foreign cotton has become more active. Yesterday, the majority of transactions were still in Indian and American cotton. Shenxin Factory purchased 300 bales of American cotton mitering, at a price of 200 to 208 yuan (cash delivered to the factory). Hongzhang Factory purchased 100 bales of raw materials for coarse yarn. Japanese factories showed slight buying interest. Other traders were actively trading, which led to firm selling prices. No shipments from northern Jiangsu have been seen. The current selling prices of cotton are recorded on the left.</p>
<p>In other news, the Shanghai foreign cotton market is rife with rumors that customs duties will increase next month, and that exchange rates have not been extended recently. Spot inventories are low, and the industry is reluctant to sell cotton, which has led to quieter trading. However, according to some sources, there are widespread rumors of a proposed increase in spot prices in Shanghai, so that the industry can order fixed goods from foreign firms, thereby regulating the amount of cotton in Shanghai, because some parties are economically depleted and unable to order on their own.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: New York opened with a firm tone due to adverse weather reports in the cotton-growing areas and poor cotton harvest conditions. Speculators bought in the middle, and the closing price rose by about five pounds compared to the previous day. Indian cotton remained unchanged including forecasts. Egyptian cotton prices rose six or seven pounds.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Thriving Industry Trade, Simultaneously Meeting Actual Sales and Replenishing Stock</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Cotton cloth prices have risen again, and factories are planning to deliver futures. Spot goods have been slightly released, and selling prices are surprisingly high. Recently, after Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang merchants purchased in bulk, powerful traders in the market are simultaneously meeting actual sales and replenishing stock, so the industry trade is thriving. Floating short positions are gradually being cleared. Yesterday, colored cloth, bleached cloth, line cloth, and woolen cloth each rose by two or three jiao per piece. Fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse twill rose by one or two jiao. 13-pound and 14-pound coarse cloth also rose by one jiao. Over 300 pieces of fine twill, coarse cloth, and fine cloth were traded on this street, and over 300 boxes of bleached, dyed, printed, and woolen cloth were traded. Speculative business accounted for the majority. Demand from Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang continues to be strong. Retail sales on this street and wholesale to the interior remain sluggish.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>White goods sales to domestic customers have revived, with transactions in fine cloth and fine twill reaching nearly 1,000 pieces. Market sentiment continues to rise. Buying interest from northern traders is strong. Fine cloth continues to rise by one to five jiao per piece. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth for September futures was offered by Dongmian Ito &amp; Co. for over 100 bales at a price of 20 yuan per piece. Spot goods in the market have also risen to 19 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen. High-grade fine twill is flat, while low-grade Bao Bei is shouting for another 2 jiao, making it 16 yuan and 2 jiao and 5 fen.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>Piece goods exports on the 19th: 24 pieces shipped to Yantai, 14 pieces to Tianjin, 45 pieces to Hong Kong, 90 pieces to Tu Le, and 140 pieces to Saigon.</p>
<h3>Grain: Flour Mills Only Supply Local Needs, Wheat Prices Rise by Another Two or Three Jiao</h3>
<p>Current flour prices have not changed much. Domestic customers are buying, but the factories are only supplying local needs and are not accepting bulk sales to customers. It is heard that domestic traders continue to offer small amounts of returned goods, so every day four or five thousand bags are shipped from Tianjin. The market price is still around 6 yuan and 1 jiao and 5 fen, while the factory price is 6 yuan cash at the original price. The market situation is firm, and the ups and downs are probably related to rice prices.</p>
<p>Flour exports on the 19th: 5,000 bags shipped to Tanggu, 7,000 bags to Tianjin, and 500 bags to Siam.</p>
<p>A total of 4,000 to 5,000 bags of wheat arrived, and trading was also brisk. Because flour sales are quite good, factories have a great need for raw materials, so they have raised prices by two or three jiao to buy in. Fuxin and Fufeng factories purchased over 30 carts combined. Speculators are also actively buying, but the buying price is only one jiao higher. Transactions also included over 20 carts, with a maximum price of 9 yuan and 8 fen, settling at 8 yuan and 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Rice Industry Suspends Trading for Reorganization, Two Batches of Foreign Rice Awaiting Loading</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market publicly announced a suspension of trading until next Monday. Since the prevalence of grey market trading, most transactions have been done in hotel rooms to avoid attention, so the suspension of the rice market has little actual impact on the rice market. Rice shops are selling high-quality white japonica rice for 32 yuan, and some are offering it for 31 yuan and 5 jiao in the French Concession. The quality of the rice varies, and so does the price, but rice at 27 or 28 yuan is of very poor quality. At this time of soaring rice prices, it seems inappropriate for the rice market to suspend trading for two days in the name of reorganization. Let's see if they have the determination to stabilize rice prices after resuming business on the 21st.</p>
<p>Yesterday, due to the rice market closure, there were no transactions in domestic indica rice from morning to afternoon. In the afternoon, there were a few sales, and the market price was slightly higher than the previous market. Wuhu market machine indica rice also reached 28 yuan, broken rice 25 yuan, and brown rice 21 yuan. A total of over 1,000 bags were traded. In addition to a few shipments that were transferred to the port, 8,000 new bags arrived at Hongkou, and they are alongside the wharf at the Hongjiang Pier, not yet transferred to the inner harbor.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: According to reports, two batches of orders are scheduled to be loaded. The first batch of 18,000 bags scheduled to be loaded within days will arrive in Shanghai as late as the 2nd of next month. Another batch of 18,000 bags is under negotiation for shipping space. One batch is part of a total of 100,000 bags, and the other batch is a separate purchase by the Relief Association. Both are expected to alleviate the Shanghai market.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Soybean Prices Frequently Reaching New Highs</h3>
<p>In the recent soybean market, in an environment of increasingly expensive commodity prices, prices are also moving upwards. Market prices are reaching new peaks. Yesterday, the market rose another four or five jiao. Sales are mainly driven by the local market, with exports only playing a minor role. Supply is continuous, and new and old beans are currently trending in the same direction. The market situation has not yet differentiated between them. Yesterday, a total of three carts of Dalian Sipingjie beans were traded, priced at 13 yuan. 200 bags of Hankou June white beans were traded, priced at 11 yuan and 5 jiao. 350 bags of Changzhou Niupi beans were traded, priced at 11 yuan and 5 jiao to 11 yuan and 3 jiao. Over 100 bags of Wuhu beans were traded, priced at 12 yuan to 11 yuan and 7 jiao. 50 bags of Hankou Zha beans were traded, priced at 11 yuan and 5 jiao. 30 bags of Pudong Du beans were traded, priced at 12 yuan and 8 jiao.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Cotton Sugar Opens at 37 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, London sugar futures continued to decline. December was down half a penny at 6 shillings, March next year was down 0.25 at 6 shillings and 1 penny, and June was down 0.75 at 6 shillings and 2.5 pence. The Shanghai Association's price chart showed that the upward trend has not weakened. No. 24 coarse white sugar rose by about one yuan, with warehouse goods at 41 yuan and 3 jiao, foreign warehouse goods at 41 yuan, and transit goods initially at 33 yuan and 1 jiao, later easing slightly to 32 yuan and 8 jiao. Taikoo granulated white sugar rose four or five jiao, East Warehouse B mark was 44 yuan and 8 jiao, West Warehouse was 45 yuan, CW mark was 44 yuan and 7 jiao, CX mark was 4 jiao, DY mark was 44 yuan, HX mark was 43 yuan and 8 jiao, H mark granulated red sugar was 27 yuan, and Dutch red sugar spot goods rose five jiao, with transit goods at 27 yuan and 8 jiao. Domestic refined white sugar rose one yuan to 41 yuan and 5 jiao for Zhenji, domestic No. 1 rock sugar rose one yuan to 45 yuan and 5 jiao, Jingming was another 47 yuan. Domestic sugar Huizhou white high-grade sugar rose two yuan to 47 yuan and 8 jiao, settling at 47 yuan and 4 jiao, with dozens of bags traded. Dongxiang red sugar rose one yuan, at 28 yuan to 27 yuan and 4 jiao, with 200 bags traded. Cotton red sugar saw a new high price, opening at 37 yuan to 36 yuan and 5 jiao for 80 bags. Yesterday, 450 bags of sugar arrived from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Fish Skin and Shark Fin Rise Together</h3>
<p>Fish skin stocks are not lacking here, but transactions are only sporadic. However, due to foreign exchange rates, the cost of replenishing stocks will be high. The current market price for white fish skin is 200 yuan, and public fish skin is 130 yuan, up 20 or 30 yuan. Shark fin prices have also risen by one-third. For example, Luzon king fin previously sold for 1,000 yuan, but now costs 1,300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Sundry Goods: Hainan Longan Offers New Crop</h3>
<p>The source of dried longan meat is now only Guangdong and Hong Kong without obstruction, while the rest have been cut off. It is heard that this year's Hainan longan harvest is good. The first batch of goods has already arrived by Sichuan wheel transport, with over 2,000 pieces yesterday, which can be exchanged immediately.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Exports, Rumors of Hongkou Inspection</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market: International conditions were weak, and Japanese and American silk prices fell. However, the fluctuations were very small. New York spot Japanese silk fell by one fen, Shanghai silk fell by two fen, Lyon Shanghai silk B fell by one franc, New York standard silk fell by one and a half fen in the near term, and remained unchanged in the long term. Yokohama spot was a small five yuan, and long-term a small four yuan.</p>
<p>The local silk market has been in a wait-and-see mode recently. Since rumors emerged that a counterfeit unified raw silk agency was about to appear in the local area, silk traders and export firms have been suspicious, and silk delivery and silk industry operations in various aspects have been sluggish or suspended as a result. This news first came from customs brokers, who said that after a certain day in August, raw silk exports must obtain a certificate from the "Raw Silk Inspection Bureau" in Hongkou and an export permit before customs can declare and load the goods. Recently, people in the silk industry have felt uneasy, but accurate news and methods have not been confirmed, so silk sales have also been sluggish.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Black Steel Billets Difficult to Develop</h3>
<p>Although the trading of black steel billets is not sluggish, the opening prices are not as firm as tinplate and Huisi iron. Before the price increase, black steel billets were sold for 45 yuan per box, but now the opening price is only around 60 yuan, or around 65 yuan. The increase is only between 30% and 40%. This is not the case with tinplate and Huisi iron. Before the price increase, tinplate was sold for about 70 yuan per box, and Huisi iron was about 60 yuan per box. Now tinplate is sold for between 150 yuan and 160 yuan per box, which is more than 50% higher than before. Huisi iron is sold for about 120 yuan per box, which is also more than 50% higher than before. Black steel billets can be considered sluggish, and the only outlets are local thermos factories, mirror factories, and speculators.</p>

<h3>Trivialities</h3>
<p>— Xiaoren</p>
<p>In the past, a scholar made a mistake in a literary allusion, and when someone pointed it out, he said, "That's just a triviality!"</p>
<p>Indeed, what's wrong with making a mistake in a literary allusion? The strange thing is that some people pay attention to such trivial matters, and the even stranger thing is that even such trivial matters can be made a mistake.</p>
<p>I am one of those people who love to pay attention to such trivial matters. Because of this, I often annoy the big shots who pay attention to important matters, and they can't wait to squeeze me out of the cultural circle. However, I can't change my old temper, and until I am squeezed out, I will always love to pay attention to trivial matters.</p>
<p>In the literary world, a popular Western saying used to be popular: "Old bottles cannot hold new wine." Writers have debated this sentence, and everyone has tried to explain the conflict between "old bottles" and "new wine." Recently, the editor of "Free Talk" clarified that the original text was not "bottle" but "leather bag," and the writers had wasted their energy. Naturally, this is a trivial matter, but this trivial matter has also cost the writers some small effort.</p>
<p>However, this is really because everyone doesn't understand, but there is no intention to deceive people. But the following two things are somewhat suspicious of "self-deception."</p>
<p>The first thing happened quite a long time ago. I don't know who brought a few pots of epiphyllum to Shanghai, posted an advertisement, and wanted people to buy tickets to see it. So a naturalist came out to write an article, saying that Shanghai had never had that flower before, and what should be seen in particular was: that it was the epiphyllum mentioned in the Buddhist scriptures. A picture of the flower was printed in a pictorial, and it was indeed an epiphyllum. It may be true that the flower had never been grown in Shanghai, but there is a Western species in Shanghai. Moreover, the Buddhist epiphyllum is based on the words in the "Lotus Sutra," but what it says is actually the udumbara flower, to put it plainly, it is a fig, and it has nothing to do with this herbaceous epiphyllum. Naturally, this is a trivial matter, but why do you have to deceive people on this trivial matter?</p>
<p>The second thing also happened quite a long time ago. It was still a naturalist's opinion - an investigation into the horse cherry blossom mentioned in Chinese old books. The naturalist said: The horse cherry blossom is the Japanese cherry blossom, and the love poem "A tree of horse cherry blossoms in front of the door" shows that cherry blossoms in ancient China were also related to "cold travel." This sounds good, but unfortunately it's nonsense. Although Japanese cherry blossoms are famous, we don't need to compete for this honor. Cherry blossoms are actually just a variant of cherry (Prunus PseudoCerasus), and in the end, they are still plants belonging to the rose family. Horse cherry blossoms belong to the legume family, and the scientific name is Albizzia jullbrissin. It is probably called this name because the leaves close at night. It would be appropriate to put this tree in a love poem. Naturally, this is a trivial matter.</p>
<p>But let it all go. Because these two things are really a bit specialized, although those who are talking nonsense may be experts. But recently I have discovered two trivial matters in the articles of writers.</p>
<p>One is about the ancient Chinese Wu Meicun. The writer said that Wu Meicun was: "He surrendered to the Qing Dynasty in his later years and spent his life living in Beijing as an important minister of the Qing court. Many literary inquisitions came from his plans." I really don't know where this news came from. Wu Meicun's "surrender to the Qing Dynasty" is absolutely true. Not only did he regret it in his poems and articles, but his name was also written in the "Records of Second Ministers" by the Qing court. But he did not become an "important minister," and he "spent his life" only eating old rice at home - of course, there was an official salary. As for the "planning" of literary inquisitions, it was not his turn. He should be scolded, but there is no need to forcibly pull him to the side of the Qing Dynasty emperor and call him conscienceless.</p>
<p>One is about the modern foreign writer D'Annunzio. The writer said that although D'Annunzio was a patriot, he was really a rascal, saying that he is now "perhaps composing poems to praise Mussolini's cause of demanding colonies back from France." It is not wrong to say that D'Annunzio is a rascal, but he is really unlikely to be "composing poems" now. Because: he died last spring. He should be scolded when he was alive, and if he were still alive, I believe he could do such a thing, but I don't believe he would crawl out of the grave to "praise Mussolini."</p>
<p>In the end, they are all trivial matters. But the channels for expressing opinions are so narrow at the moment, and I am glad that I have not been squeezed out of the cultural circle, so it doesn't matter if I talk about them.</p>
<h3>Shadow</h3>
<p>— Huang Suqiu</p>
<p>All the gods are dead,</p>
<p>Now we hope that the superman will live forever.</p>
<p>— Nietzsche's words to Sulu</p>
<p>Countless layers of gray-black clouds are condensing, and judging from the signs, it's going to rain again!</p>
<p>The air outside the window is filled with the stench of distant gunpowder smoke. The thunder no longer roars, and the deathly silence is heralding the solemnity of the night before the storm.</p>
<p>"Open the window, let some fresh air in."</p>
<p>When I thought of this famous quote from Pushkin, I consciously opened the window, and then swept my eyes over that group of flame-like young people. In so many flowing ranks, I found that a child had not come.</p>
<p>Immediately, a slender shadow flickered in front of me. On her solemn face, those two resolute eyes seemed to be staring at me, gradually sending me a series of questions. From her slightly hoarse voice, I knew she was waiting for a reply with excessive anxiety. I was silenced by her firmness. I thought I should say more about the battle between man and the devil - in this arena of blood exchanging with blood and flesh colliding with flesh, the endowed throat should be opened.</p>
<p>So I began to say:</p>
<p>"Iron will should be expressed in iron actions. In the current era of national struggle, only struggle can be talked about survival, and only bloodshed can obtain freedom..."</p>
<p>What followed was silence. A kind of excessive conflict was tormenting her will, and she no longer painted a smile on her face.</p>
<p>After this, she never kept questions in her mouth again. She was often seen silently immersed in a book in a corner alone, and sometimes she would chase and run with two or three friends on the campus road. Her eyebrows were often knitted into thousands of knots by her thoughts, but she often swayed a layer of comfort in her thoughts. Without laughter, her happiness was woven into bright excitement; and this inner secret was often kept by young people like her.</p>
<p>From then on, time advanced with sprouting thoughts. From spring to summer, the child began to mature her dreams. It was said that when the big exam was not over, she stepped into another sea of blood in life, imagining that her blood would wash away the shame of the new China, and imagining that her sound and heroic figure would bravely step in front of the tide of resistance. - Bless the child's health for a country that is standing up!</p>
<p>However, rain is gathering outside the window, and the gray-black clouds are pressing down so that people can't breathe. At night, beasts and butchers lurk all around. Let's look forward to dawn, we thirst for the advent of the storm.</p>
<p>Dressed in military uniform, she is as beautiful as a flower. Make-up is better than the times, do not return home early.</p>

<h3>Cook Squad Leader (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yuhua</p>
<p>He had also been a combat soldier for six years, during the years before and after the Northern Expedition. He was a machine gunner who carried a machine gun all year round. Later, because his eyesight deteriorated, he still worked as a cook. Later, during the "January 28th" Shanghai war, he unexpectedly fought another battle. That was when he was under the command of General Wang Jingjiu of the 87th Division. On the front line where the battle was very fierce, he saw that many of his comrades in front had died, and the machine gunner was also seriously injured. The Japanese troops, like madmen, were hiding behind armored vehicles and rushing over. So the squad leader became anxious, ran to the machine gun, set it up and fired. The Japanese troops were forced to retreat in a panic. This time he thought it was the most enjoyable battle of his life. Since the War of Resistance this time, the brave Squad Leader Bu has not had a chance to show his skills again.</p>
<p>Squad Leader Bu has accumulated many years of experience, and his cooking skills have really reached the most proficient level. He can tell whether the rice is cooked by the steam, and he can estimate the correct time for how much rice to cook. He has cooked meals for up to 4,000 people.</p>
<p>During the Changsha fire on November 12, General Yu Jishi sent Squad Leader Bu to lead nineteen people to cook for the refugees in the refugee shelter. The meals and vegetables for the more than 1,700 refugees in the shelter required a total of twelve dan of rice, 1,200 jin of vegetables, and 200 jin of pork every day. They used ten sets of military stoves. Each meal required cooking twelve pots of vegetables and twenty-five pots of rice, divided into five batches. So after breakfast was over, dinner was started. The squad leader and nineteen comrades had to get up as early as two o'clock in the morning and not sleep until ten o'clock in the evening, busy all day long. The squad leader has not complained in the past month; he said that his family was poor when he was a child and he was often hungry. He knew this pain, and he was happy to cook for the refugees.</p>
<p>Not only did he cook meals, but he also boiled water for more than a thousand refugees to wash their faces, while he himself was covered in black ash from the coal smoke.</p>
<p>"Boss Bu," people pointed to his face and said, "You're as black as an Indian, why don't you wash your face? What will it look like when the corps commander comes to visit!"</p>
<p>"Haha, the corps commander probably won't recognize me." He wiped his face with his sleeve.</p>
<p>"Boss Bu, you can't cook for the fire refugees again next time." The brothers in Changsha warned him.</p>
<p>"Okay, don't joke, there must never be another big fire!"</p>
<p>This time, the New Changsha newspaper introduced the hardworking Squad Leader Bu once, saying: "Squad Leader Bu cooks just the right amount of rice, neither raw nor hard, he is really capable!" When he saw the newspaper, he quickly denied it and said: "This is not my merit alone, it is all the matter of everyone." So he read the newspaper to his companions.</p>
<p>These cooks are really hardworking. The authorities of the shelter specially慰劳 them once, had a big meal, and prepared to send them a commemorative medal.</p>
<h3>Night Boat</h3>
<p>— Crazy Wind</p>
<p>The setting sun cast a purple-copper net,</p>
<p>A faint moon hangs upside down in the evening mist;</p>
<p>The night boat crawls with heavy steps,</p>
<p>Waves roar and break the stillness of the river.</p>
<p>Pull, the rapid tide is coming near ahead,</p>
<p>The heart rolls and turns with the boat;</p>
<p>A road stretching into the dusk,</p>
<p>Rolls up thousands of miles of silver waves.</p>
<p>The night lightly slips past the boatmen's feet,</p>
<p>The stream of life rises with the river.</p>
<p>Throwing off a body of fatigue, tumbling down the hillside</p>
<p>Catching a glimmer of river lights.</p>
<h3>Lost</h3>
<p>— Gu Ding</p>
<p>The past was a period of being lost, and what about the present? Isn't it still the same? As for the future, it will still be like this, only everyone dares not think about it, cannot think about it, and need not think about it.</p>
<p>Falling from one state of being lost into another, life is a journey. On both sides of the journey are dense forests, and inside the forests, it is dark, so dark that there is not a single ray of light. Therefore, remember that you once shouted for light, but in fact, this kind of shouting is a self-disturbing foolish thing. There are no streetlights on the journey of life: if there are, they are the sun, or the moon, secretly revealing themselves through the gaps in the clouds, so that you won't fumble around too much.</p>
<p>But fumbling is still too difficult.</p>
<p>Here is being lost, and there is also being lost. Here, thorns grow densely, and there, thorns grow densely. Even roses and sweetbrier have small thorns, so how can the wild flowers and grasses along the roadside be smooth? It is difficult to walk, and everywhere is being lost!</p>
<p>Perhaps there will be a bright and pure star that can guide a lost person, but there are also mischievous will-o'-the-wisps, dedicated to doing harmful work.</p>
<p>What is called a fortunate life? Perhaps what is so-called fortune is just a muddled covering up. People wandering in a lost state will not be able to see clearly the road in front of them, and if they think it is a flat and smooth avenue and confidently take a step, there is a danger of falling.</p>
<p>Danger, life is full of danger. Eyeballs will never see clearly, and other than the power of will, I think there is nothing that can solve being lost.</p>

<p>Arts and Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Ice Model Prank in New York World's Fair</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The World's Fair has been held in New York for three months. There are often disputes in the venue, especially in the entertainment section. Because New York City merchants have invested $17 million in it, they try their best to pursue a commercial atmosphere and sexualization. The former had an obscene nude dance performance in the central venue, which was severely stopped by the Changju Bureau. The leading dancers were expelled from the venue, and the atmosphere was immediately refreshed. But recently, it has returned to its old appearance, which is quite imaginative. There is a so-called "Frozen Alive Death Defying" performance, in which dancers publicly lie naked in a coffin-shaped ice box, enduring the cold to compete for how long they can last, to please the audience. The entrance to the frozen stage is very well decorated, with photos of famous dance stars and their frozen times hanging, curious people enter the venue to admire and pay a certain ticket fee. The performance procedure is very simple. The performer first wipes her body with cold water, and then an assistant helps her to lie supine in a rectangular transparent ice box, which is four inches thick, two feet high. Then, from heel to head, she is gradually covered with ice tiles. Her skin is snugly attached to the ice, and the heat surges until it reaches the point of stiffness, then she is lifted out, and rubbed with alcohol, which can restore her to normal. Although the matter is ordinary, no less than 10,000 people come to see it every day. There is one Annie Thai, whose muscles are particularly resistant to cold. She can lie in the ice coffin for as long as twenty-one minutes, winning the championship. Recently, she released a short interview to reporters, roughly saying: "This is the latest money-making method invented by unemployed comrades in the dance world. We lie in ice three times a day to maintain our livelihoods. This performance is not fake at all. When we enter the coffin, we do not apply oil or ointment to our whole body. We only fill two towels under our lower body. How hard-working and enduring is this? Of course, this absolutely does not harm public morals. The current endurance record in the ice coffin is temporarily maintained by me, and I hope that my sisters will do their best to support me." Although her words are high-sounding, the police often know that they are a kind of prank, trying to use "bitter tactics" to win social sympathy, undermine the law, and seek huge profits. Experts are now studying methods of sanctions.</p>

<h3>From Stage to Screen (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Yin Di</p>
<p>— As narrated by Ms. Yuan Meiyun —</p>
<p>When I was performing on the Tianchan stage, Mr. Shao Zuiweng, the owner of Tianyi Film Company, came to Tianchan to see my play. At that time, Tianyi was preparing to produce the sound film "Entertainment Conference", and Mr. Shao came to discuss with me, wanting me to join as a guest star. I agreed. In the film "Entertainment Conference", there are many songs, dances, and Peking opera inserts. I participated in a performance of "You Long Xi Feng", which was my first step onto the screen.</p>
<p>After that, Mr. Shao discussed with me and asked me to be a basic actress for Tianyi. At that time, I had not yet decided to completely give up stage life, so I only agreed to sign a one-year contract, and stipulated that I would only shoot three films a year. In this way, I successively starred in the three films "Little Actress", "Flying Catkins", and "Vitality" at Tianyi. Among them, "Little Actress" was my first work to officially play the female lead, and I was fifteen years old at that time.</p>
<p>The following year, I transferred from Tianyi to Yihua. At this time, I gradually felt the importance of film art, so I also began to engage in research and observation of the eighth art. At Yihua, I starred in more than ten films one after another. The first film was "The Angry Tide of the Chinese Sea" directed by Yue Feng, and there were also "Human Fairy", "Escape", "Wedding Night", "Bi Yu's Ambition", "Love in the Sea and Sky", "Bloody Case of 303", "Incarnation Girl", "Flowers Bloom and Fall", etc. Among them, the one I least wanted to act in was "Incarnation Girl". Recently, two sequels have been made. For the sake of face, I couldn't refuse, and this difficulty may not be understood by the audience, but I really had no choice.</p>
<p>When the war broke out, all film companies stopped, so I unexpectedly stepped onto the Peking opera stage again, singing at the Carlton Theater for half a month. Carlton's invitation to me had a bit of origin, because in the past I had guest starred in the film "Zhan Jing Tang" of Huaan Film Company, and collaborated with Mr. Zhou Jiafang on the screen, and the hosts of Carlton were the former giants of Huaan. Initially, Tao Bosun, Wu Bangfan, and Liang Guangsheng represented Carlton and negotiated with me. The next day, they invited Mr. Zhou Xinfang to have dinner with me at the Da Guangming Cafe. Mr. Zhou Xinfang expressed his hope that I would cooperate on the stage again, which evoked a wonderful fantasy of my old stage career. I gladly accepted their request, but at this time, because I had another plan to go to Chongqing, I only agreed to sing for half a month. Carlton said that half a month was fine, so I only signed a half-month contract, and after half a month, Carlton also temporarily stopped performing.</p>
<p>After Zhang Eyun's last performance at Golden, she returned north with praise. She is now living as a recluse in the Tianjin French Concession and will no longer perform during the summer. There was a letter to Shanghai saying that she will come to Shanghai after the Double Ninth Festival to perform at Golden, probably following Tan Fuying and Zhang Junqiu. The group will include Yang Baolin, Ye Shengdan, Ma Fulu, etc.</p>

<h3>Star Six Star Chronicle 8—?</h3>
<p>The following novel is the masterpiece of this Miss ?. She used to dance at Lido and has now moved to the Metropolis. Once she met me on the road and expressed her admiration. The next day, she sent me this masterpiece and asked me to correct it. I think she is only around twenty years old, and she actually has such talent, which is really a promising junior worthy of encouragement. Also, because the original article was too long, I specially made an effort to cut it down to fill this publication. If you can guess her name, she and I will give a small reward to answer your elegant intention. She is very beautiful and dances very well. Now, she is also considered my student. I will announce her name in the next issue, so wait for it.</p>
<p>"A road in western Shanghai. The western half is the best residential area, with excellent environment. To take the tram, you have to walk east for a while.</p>
<p>It is already the middle of summer, and summer nights are the most pleasing. On this quiet road, in addition to the people who are busy pursuing their goals, there are also a group of carefree summer night enjoyers, walking and talking or singing softly.</p>
<p>Among them is a pair of young pedestrians. The man is twenty-three or four years old, wearing a white suit, black bow tie, and white buckskin shoes. The woman is wearing a tree-green shawl on her upper body, and the lower half is revealing a red striped silk cheongsam, and she is wearing a pair of blue and white checkered Jingyang leather high heels. They are about the same age and are walking side by side.</p>
<p>"Do you feel too tired walking like this?" the man said.</p>
<p>"No, I can still walk," the woman replied with a smile.</p>
<p>"Remember the last time we walked to Shuyu with Bage and others, and the time before that was when we went to Jinlong with your cousin and her husband," the woman continued.</p>
<p>The man suddenly felt a sense of sorrow and said: "But, not once have you not taken a car after dinner and left, and I have to go home alone. When will we be able to go out and come back together?" (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Strange Gorilla</h3>
<p>— Qi Hua</p>
<p>The consistent nonsensical style of the Li Zi three brothers, after their collaboration with Tang Amman in "The Three Musketeers", can be said to have opened up a new path. Because purely nonsensical behavior cannot be the main body of a movie, but as a partial auxiliary, it is still a comical role. This "Strange Gorilla" is a follow-up to "The Three Musketeers." Here, there are Leon Andrews and Logosi, who specialize in horror films, and the Li Zi three brothers are also relegated to auxiliary positions. However, compared with "The Three Musketeers," the new attempt of the Li Zi seems to have failed again. Because the director of "Strange Gorilla" has achieved equal success in dealing with horror films, such as light, sound, camera angles, and emotional atmosphere, with his surpassing techniques; however, because the Li Zi three brothers have more acting opportunities, it damages the unity of the entire play.</p>
<p>The film opens by writing about the terrifying situation after the appearance of the strange gorilla, from the superimposed printing to pulling out the maid's scream, and then introducing that the entire house is completely shrouded in a gloomy situation, as well as the appearance of Leon Andrews and Logosi; and as midnight approaches, at the moment when the time of the strange gorilla's warning is about to arrive, the thunder and rain outside the house are intertwined; Naoma's anxiety; the maid's horror; the close-up of the pendulum; the close-up of Leon Andrews' face; the heavy footsteps from upstairs... the suffocating, horrified atmosphere is grasped extremely firmly. But the Li Zi three brothers' play—in several scenes where they encounter the gorilla (one audience member shouted why not take out a gun to shoot). This too much nonsense destroys the tense air of the entire play.</p>
<p>The appearance of柯立蒂is too abrupt; and there is too little foreshadowing for the character of羅哥西, so when 柯立蒂announces that he is an agent and uncovers Leon Andrews' hiding place at the end, everyone thinks that the case is solved; but羅哥西's pursuit is an amazing stroke, but it is even more abrupt.</p>
<p>Leon Andrews,羅哥西,潘茜凱蘭's composure, insidiousness, and panic are all well acted.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Long-legged General is busy hanging and splitting plaques at the hall performance.</p>
<p>He looked up and saw me, and also saw the car beside me, and was overjoyed. I let him sit in my car, and he was able to enter the city safely. After a short rest, everyone was busy paying their respects and attending the banquet. I said to Huisheng: Why don't you ask Boss Yang to convey a message for you, you don't have to go to pay your respects right away, and you can't go to the banquet especially. It's better for me to take you to take a bath first, ask someone to hammer and pound the joints on your body, and sleep soundly for two or three hours. When you wake up, eat a little thin porridge, and then go to the backstage to put on your makeup. This way, you won't miss anything. Otherwise, you will definitely get sick. It's a small matter that you can't go on stage and don't get money, but if the play doesn't have anyone to accompany it, it will delay big things. After hearing this, he agreed very much, and we went to Canglang Pond to take a bath and rest. Sure enough, most of his illness was gone, and there were no mistakes in the three days of the play. After the play, he returned to Ping and performed Xinying with Yang, Yu, Chen德霖, Gong云甫, Qian, Wang, and others. With so many famous actors, the ticket price was only one yuan and two jiao. Unfortunately, it did not last long, and the hospital suddenly burned down, and the whole class scattered. Uncle Yan no longer partnered, and looking at Ping, Tianjin, Ningbo, Shanghai, there was no longer the盛况of Xinying Theater with Yang, Yu, Xun, Chen, and others on the same stage. Also, Wang Zuo and Tang Jiao in the play are both extremely loyal and remember old kindness. Zhang Chen and his companion, when watching the two plays, of course all expressed a kind of envy, but it was not long before they fought each other. The birthday plaque was hung quickly, but the knife was also very sharp. World affairs are like child's play. Since the Republic of China, the Northern Warlords have often fought fiercely for private interests, hurting both sides. Only Chen was able to maintain his position forever, which is also strange (84) ! (End of this section)</p>
