<h3 id="c14">上海外匯問題的［癓結］ <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>自中國財政部馬電實行以來，已近十天了，從過去十天的經過來觀察，在某一意義上，不能不認為有相當成就，如物價的回跌，外商股票的暴降，外匯的放長，（英匯曾到七便士，美匯亦到十三元六二五），並且在接近上月底的幾天裘，日商銀行的售出外匯，更反映着他們內心的苦悶，不過，從又方面看起來，限制提現的辦法，還不脫「頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚」的性質，「治標有餘，治本不足。」在目前，因為法幣頭寸的緊縮，造成了市面反動的跌落，但是資本逃避旣不因此而杜絕，華商銀行亦不免因此而付過於存。所幸黑市塲的外匯根本沒有大量供給，而洋商銀行亦能拒絕開立新存戶；不然，很可能的造成為淵敺魚之局。競事窖藏，要非大數，亦無大害。且待「風頭」漸過，行見法幣的頭寸，依然會逐漸鬆動；而物價的跌風却也不會持久，甚至還有步漲的可能；變本加厲，造成更高紀錄，也不是意外事。即就日商銀行套取外匯而論，目前確能予以相當的打擊，但將來法幣的頭寸稍寬，他們不免還要活動吧！</p>
<p>再說到這一次提款限制的內容，我們也曾指出對於工商界存款的不利，除了工資的發放，可以向公司行號特別提款審査委員會申請之外，其餘工商業上的正當需要，至今沒有補救的辦法。長此和普通存戶一體辦理的話，工商業當然繼續受其影響。所應注意的，目前的環境，比不得八一三的時候。那時候本來是工商淸閒的季節、所以戰事爆發，全市工商業都停頓起來，儘管你只許每星期提百分之五，最高額以一百五十元為限．那也沒有多大關係。可是現在怎樣呢？一來是工商業活躍的節令，二來又是絲蠶豆麥的登場；因此之故，十天以來，大家期待者補充的辦法，簡直是嗷嗷待哺一般。雖然發行新匯劃五千萬元的事，不日成為事實，那也不過是銀錢業內部籌碼上的調節；即使對工商業發生一些間接的關係，亦微細得很。就說再能夠發行一種「匯劃證」，可以流通市面，同時我們也假定它的流通，並不防碍法幣的統一國策，然亦不是短期所能實現的。</p>
<p>至於這一次提現再限制的辦法，財政當局的表示，也說是暫時的措施，日後市面稍定，，就可以取消。這在根本說、來，性質原是如此；但以我們的管見，以為國民政府當局，具有決心，要消除法幣所受的威脅，關鍵不在乎通貨的張弛；即使為了對付風狂雨暴，不得不着眼於通貨，而厲行通貨收縮，也得確認為治標的策略。治標是一時的，救急的；若使估量治標策略的功效太高，而任使治標期間過於延長，則一面使法幣窖藏與外流的風氣積重難返，一面使上海金融反而受其威脅。因為限制提現原來並非禁止提現，時間與空問相積之結果，將使限制完全失效。這就以限制提現為治標策略的本身言之，事理必然如此。要知道目前的癥結，還在外匯。外匯的病態，在於上海的黑市。控制上海的黑市外匯無辦法，則限制上海提現豈有實效；逃避者依然逃避，投機者依然投機，徒然使一般正當的工商業者為所犧牲。癥結在此，治本大難；這在我們不應空言高論，在當局也無可空手成功；但是當局對於黑市的現行政策，至少還有相機修正的餘地。例如對於黑市外匯，在某種方式之下，採用申請制度，母使太阿倒持。如此辦法，當然不能做到外匯的理想境界；但直接可以限制外匯的無度消耗，間接可以防止資金逃避與日方套購。理想而不能支配現實，不如使現實接近理想！</p>

<p>（柏林）　英外相哈裏法克斯昨晚發表演說後、柏林各報各自鹹加以攻擊「金融報」宣稱、英國閣員所推行之宣似運動、有兩種錯誤、（一）彼等相信重複理由不充分之嘗論、可惟使其國量加强、（二）彼等對於國外人士之常識及觀察能力、估計太低、以為可惟掩蓋天下人耳目其實哈氏演說、何常非舊話翻、一言惟蔽之、仍企圖達到勢力均衡之英國一貫政策而已、「德意志總彙報」宣稱德國自陷孤立、實為錯誤、德國固絕未孤立、蓋與中立鄰邦、均保有良好陸誼、即英國劃入危險區域強迫予惟保證之各國、其生存攸關之利益、亦固德國所承認雲、（三十日海通社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）　今晨各報皆載英外相哈立法克斯演詞之節略、羅馬人民報稱之為冠冕堂皇、而缺乏建設性、並謂其言辛辣而含威脅、但不若前一日邱吉爾所發演說之具外交的方式、又曰、英人未能覺悟豪富之不列顛、今方在不可避免的墮落中矣、（三十日路透社電）</p>

<p>銀錢公吿半年決算</p>
<p>上海銀行業同業公會曁錢業同業公會昨日公吿云「、査七月一二日為銀行錢莊半年決算假期、惟二日本屬星期例假、照章應於次日補足一日、故本兩公會各銀行錢莊、均於七月一·二·三日休假三天、特此公吿、」各行莊准七月四日起開市營業、惟七月一日至三日、對外雖休假、對內視各行莊之業務、照常辦公、趕辦半年決算事宜、</p>

<p>錢業通過辦理結賬</p>
<p>新聲社記者咋向錢業探悉、錢業結賬、向為農曆之年終、其長期信用放款、為四月底及十月底、所以每逢銀行辦理半年決算時、錢業則仍照常營業、錢業聯合準備庫亦照常辦公、所以錢業公會之休假表上、並無休假規定、惟今年經公會通過、與銀行業共同辦理半年決算、故已與銀行公會聯合通吿、辦理半年決算、</p>
<p>金融巿塲依然穩定</p>
<p>昨日雖為六月底、銀錢業辦理決算之日、上海金融市塲、自財部馬電限制提存後、依然穩定如恒、錢業市塲拆息、反自一一角二分降為二角、四行貼放會及銀行準備庫、各種貼放利率、並無變動、惟票據交換所為便利同業票據收解起見、特將票據交換時間、酌予延遲、規定自下午四時四十五分開始、至於代收票據時間仍照舊、</p>
<p>銀行盈餘各業安渡</p>
<p>又據新聲者向各業探悉、戰後上海租界內各業、因人口增加、需要激增、以致均畸形發展、此次端節結賬、均有盈餘、所以各銀行六月底到期之放款、均能如期收回、半年決算之結果、因此能獲相當盈餘、市塲上絕無不幸事件之發生、情形反較戰前為佳、各業均吿安謐渡過、此實為政府銀行調劑之功也、</p>

<p>工部局總裁費信惇、於本年六月底任滿退休、六月二十八日、該局董事會開會時、總董樊克令曾致詞略稱、今日為本局各董事與總栽費信惇相聚之最後一次會議、上次本局副總董已在舉行歡送宴會時、表示各僚董惜別之情、鄰人茲欲再向費君表示、局方對於其服務之成績、感佩良深、費君自一九二七年起、任總裁之職、以至於今、其間勞績卓著、本埠居民、莫不同聲敬仰、此次費君退休、在局方固為損失、然在鄙人方面、得一臂助、蓋費君將與鄙人合作執行律務等語、會中各董事一致鼓掌歡送、</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、工部局總裁費信惇今（三十日）午最後一次以工部局僱員資格而離其辦公室、多年服務、至是吿畢、但欲獲其忠吿、仍可得之、記者今晨訪晤費氏、據稱、余無異感、亦無特殊可奉吿者、余尙無離滬意、惟切欲休憇、數月內或將買棹赴美國之太平洋沿海一遊么、按費氏並不退休、而將重操律業、</p>

<p>自財政部馬電實施限制提成辦法後、因其性質旨在對滬市套取外匯者加以取締、故經銀錢業根據馬電、商訂七項辦法、俾於取締外匯投機之外、對於正當商業、仍予竭力維護、本報記者昨向金融界探悉、銀錢業公會會將議定之七項辦法、及商定同業匯劃辦法、電財政部報吿、茲悉財部頃已電復、關於調劑法幣籌碼、已令中中交各行酌量辦理、其他各點、亦准照辦、至於各方關心之匯劃貼水問題、昨據銀行公會消息、因銀行聯合準備委員會已商定將原有匯劃存款、分期掉換法幣、故七月四日以後、匯劃貼水即自然趨於消滅、一面實行新規定之同業匯劃制度、期使外商銀行對於此項匯劃票據、獲得確實聯絡、至此後工商各界向內地採辦原料、即可以此項匯劃向各行轉匯、而由內地銀行撥付現鈔、據金融界消息、此項辦法、已獲財政部之許可、並已由財部轉令各行照辦、故日來市上關心之內地辦貨匯款問題、業已獲得妥善解决、咋日金融界方面復有傳述財部將於月初對，於匯劃部份有所說明一節、此說經記者昨晚向銀行界權威方面探詢、不能證實、據云、截至目前為止、迄無所聞、預料財部對於滬市銀錢業最近所擬定限制提存後各項辦法、現已分別准予照辦及備案、此後滬市金融、旣吿安定、則此次安定金融之措施、當已吿一段落矣、</p>
<p>領用登記</p>
<p>銀行聯合準備委員會辦理同業領用匯劃、總額暫定為國幣五千萬元、自辦理領用匯劃後、準七月四日實行、凡行莊均得以提供財產為準備、向該會領用、並各行莊提供之財產準備、經該會評定價値後。收人匯劃往來戶、並發給支票簿、以憑支用、該支票簿所簽出之支票、由銀行準備會劃付、此項支票即為同業匯劃、凡如持此同業匯劃者、得向銀行準備會掉取匯劃證、</p>
<p>洋商贊同</p>
<p>關於外商銀行收受匯劃票據、自經銀行業公會與洋商銀行公會磋商後、洋商各銀行對於領用匯劃制度原則、表示贊同、已允同業匯劃、准予抵作軋頭寸之用、具體辦法、尙在接洽之中、並允派員參加上海市銀錢業同業匯劃準備檢査委員會、所以此後匯劃票據制度經改良後、市塲上已能普遍流通、因此流通效力、與現款無殊、足能供應本市工商業資令之用、</p>

<p>銀行準備委員會為評定各行莊領月同業匯劃之担保品價値起見、決聘請專家組織評價委員會、分　房地產股、　證券股票股、　貨物股、每股設主席委員一名、執行委員若干名、並設同業匯劃準備檢査委員會、委員人數為五人、俟各團體推定後、即行宣吿成立、此後每月至少舉行檢査一次、並將領用數額及担保品種類數額、分別公吿、</p>
<p>轉滙內地</p>
<p>同業滙劃、得轉滙內地、供採辨土貨之用、已在銀行聯合準備會領用滙劃辦法內第十二條規定、據新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、凡上海市各工廠行號需要土貨原料、欲向內地採辦、過去必須現鈔、此後可持此滙劃向各銀行轉滙內地、與法幣完全相同、所以將來如持滙劃者、毋庸再向小錢莊申請貼現、故滙劃貼水確有自動消滅之可能、萬一不能完全消滅、決不致如過去之猖獗、</p>
<p>掉換法幣</p>
<p>銀錢業為集中各行莊原有存放銀行凖備會及錢業凖備庫之滙劃存款、決自半年決算後、分十二星期、按百分之九十五掉換法幣，該項法幣、係由中中交農四行所供給、所以以後市塲、除增加有確實担保之滙劃新籌碼外、並增加法幣籌碼二千萬元、同時銀行聯合準備會、此後每日公佈同業滙劃之利率、及滙劃存款利率、至於滙劃票據能普遍流通後、滙劃貼水、或將自動消滅、</p>

<p>人物高蘭生、其人除花會外、兼營其它賭博、六月十六日晚、渠離汕頭路某妓院時、被人槍擊而受重傷、高渾名「麻皮阿根」、其妻於已往數年中、曾一再被烟賭案仇敵所恐嚇、最受花會流毒者、為苦力階級、最小賭法僅銅元一枚、中則賠二十九倍、在公共租界警務處治區以外之西區各部份、現在花會分筒約二百處、亦僱持械守衛者、徒手者兼仃航船與望風、花會總筒僱有持械守衛者三十人、分筒各有一人、</p>
<p>終日守衛</p>
<p>然後護送一日所得、前往勞勃生路旁之總筒、本文所述各賭窟與花會筒、均向「大道」當局領有執照、聞此係「大道」政府之坡大收入、因此可確言、直接藉上海日軍侵佔區內此種罪惡而謀生之地痞、總數約在三千人左右、內持械者佔三分之一、在浦東者尚不計在內、近數月來浦東之烟賭業、亦大熾矣、</p>

<p>雲飛汽車公司創業二十週年紀念特刊</p>
<h3 id="c78">二十年來與時邁進之　雲飛汽車公司槪况 <a href="#c78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>雲飛汽車公司，創辦於民國八年七月，迄今已歷二十週年，以資本充實，人才超越，設備完美，管理嚴密，馳譽全埠，雲飛現有汽車數百輛，分站十餘處，司機經騐豐富，車輛悉經檢騐，本服務社會之精神，以乘客之便利與安全為前提，全力以赴，罔或稍懈，故甚營業年來蒸蒸日上，而出租汽車之為交通利賴之必需工具，亦於是乎為社會所公認，而不復視為徒供馳騁作樂之奢侈品，雲飛提倡之功誠不可沒，其前途之發展，尤未可限量，茲者欣逢該公司二十週年紀念，爰特略述雲飛之概況：</p>
<p>創業時代　雲飛汽車公司，開始營業於民國八年之七月一日，行址在法租界環龍路七十七號，當時所置出差汽車僅十輛，均蓬式，內部職員祗九人，司機及銅匠合計亦不過廿餘人，電話號碼最初為「西一八九」，因彼時電話公司，尚採用分區編號制也，及改裝自動機後，雲飛號碼亦即更換，蓋即現在盡人皆知之「三〇一八九」是也。</p>
<p>添設分站　雲飛開業為幾，商業區方面營業漸形發達，為適應需要起見，遂首先設立分站於仁記路，自後營業益盛，需要愈殷，雲飛分站亦遂遍設於各處，如仁記路愛多亞路及外灘三處分站，係專為便利上落寫字間之乘客而設立，派克路站滿石路站及南京戲院分站，對於觀戲顧客，租車代步尤為便利，其他如環龍路站，靜安寺站及憶定盤路站等，則為供應車輛之大本營，車輛進出，日夜不停，支配分派，便捷異常，因此雲飛顧客，無論何時喚車，均可隨喚即至，彌感便利，雲飛各分站內，並附設招待室，置有舒適之座位，以便乘客小憩片刻，而無須鵠立以待，雲飛除設有分站多處外，並首先創辦代叫處，委託各區商店代為喚車，以便乘客，同時更率先採用，美國最新式電鐘，時間準確，字碼簡明，各站一律採用，時間不爽分秒，對於計算乘車時間，自不致有錯誤，凡此種種，蓋皆為乘客謀便利者。</p>
<p>續購新車　雲飛汽車公司以營業發達，原有車輛不敷支配，已多次添辦新車，現更為謀顧客乘車享受極度舒適起見，際此外匯緊縮，車價飛漲之時，復訂購一九三九年式八汽缸轎車數十輛，於本年二月份起，絡續加入出差，約在最近期內，即可全部到齊，屆時雲飛所有出差車輛，泰半為最新式之八汽缸轎車，舒適穩快，兼而有之，自顧客方面言之，其所享受者，與自備汽車無異，斯蓋具有自備汽車之便利，而無自備汽車之耗費者也。</p>
<p>總行概況　雲飛以營業突飛猛進，原有總站不敷展佈，爰於民國廿三年雙十節，遷入大西路七十六號新址，該處所佔面積達十七畝以上，地基之廣闊，規模之宏偉，實為滬上車行所僅見，至於組織及設施，尤為完備之至，總行內設總管理處，賬務處，機務處，車務處及機件棧房車胎部，油漆部，號衣間，木匠間，電池間，騐車間，車床間，汽油間，裁縫間，寄宿舍，圖書室，餐室，浴室，理髮室，及廚房等，此外並設有醫藥領證處，聘請海上中西名醫十餘位，為各級員工及司機人常年免費診治，因人數眾多，公司方面每年支出之醫藥費一項，為數頗鉅，其待遇職工及司機人之優厚，即此可見。</p>
<p>檢騐車輛　雲飛汽車公司特斥鉅資購備最新水壓式昇車機以為檢騐車輛之用所有各車輛規定每隔十天，即須進塢檢騐，並施以各種小修理，至隔十個月，則將車完全拆卸，分別修整，如底盤由底盤間修理之，引擎則由機器間修理之，藉使其完善無疵，與新無異，他如拐軸及變速機等，胥經最後檢騐，然後重新裝配而成車，至所備各種零件，多至不可勝數，如彈簧及火星塞等，亦皆陳列井然，以備隨時換用，再凡應用於車身之各件，如門鎖等，以及機器間所用之各種工具，均係自製，無須外求，則其規模之恢弘，設備之完善，技術之精巧，即此可見，至如見及當時工作情狀，尤可深信雲飛汽車之安然疾駛通　，予乘客以便利與安全，固不知經過幾許繁重工作也。</p>
<p>司機訓練，雲飛公司，對於選用司機，極為慎重，故其限制　嚴，雲飛車務處，深知司機之訓練問題，洵宜極端重視，爰常召集司機人於總公司內，教以關於彼輩工作方面之一切智識，反復解說，不嚴求詳，至其訓練要旨，當然以安全為最高原則，故凡關於機件之必要智識，以及交通規則，及急救須知等，均為着重之點，至於熟悉路徑，及對待顧客，和藹謙恭，尤為充任雲飛司機所必備之條件，要而言之，安全與服務，乃雲飛對於司機孜孜訓練之二大主旨也。注意車胎　車胎損壞洩氣或爆裂等，不僅為公司之損失，抑且予乘客以不便，蓋或因此延誤要公也，雲飛全部出差車輛，鮮有中途發生車胎洩氣或爆破等情事者，此蓋由於雲飛不惜高價，採用特優車胎，並特別注意於車胎氣壓是否恰得其宜故也，關於安然舒適與時間經濟等方面，雲飛為乘客設想者，洵無微不至也。</p>
<p>車身油漆　雲飛汽車，於每年大修時，概行拆卸，分別刷洗修理，然後重新裝配成車，由噴漆間加以漆飾，其一切油漆手續，蓋與新車無稍異，雲飛總行內有噴漆間三處，一律燃用特殊強光燈，以利工作之進行，至於漆料，係選用最名貴之特種汽車漆，漆成兩種椶黃色別，熠熠生輝，光彩照人，彌壯觀瞻，雲飛汽車二百餘輛，每隔十一個月，每輛均須重新油漆，故每年所用漆之數量，殊可驚也。</p>
<p>保存失物　成以為僱乘汽車，如或遺失物件於車內，當無珠還之望，但此種見解，殊不　由於雲飛汽車，試參觀雲飛總行，則失物待領部，即赫然呈現於眼簾，該部特製擱架，並加封鎖，所有平時於各車內檢獲遺失物件，無論鉅細貴賤，概行收藏其中，並編列檢藏日期，及汽車號數等，以待失主認領。</p>
<p>贈電話牌　雲飛為各界打電話時免除檢查號碼之麻煩起見，首先分贈電話牌二種，一為住宅用，一為商店用，自民國廿二年起，每逢歲首，分贈一次，從未間斷。</p>
<p>電話諧音　「三〇一八九」，固已為盡人皆知之電話號碼，雲飛為助各界雅興，並使顧客易於永久記憶，特創作諧音成句「歲臨宴杯酒」，及俚句「三拳一杯酒」云。</p>

<p>最新話機科學管理　指派車輛應接電話　井然有序迅速無比</p>
<p>三〇一八九　三〇一八九，殆已為滬市盡人皆知之電話號碼，推原其故。蓋雲飛歷年來盡美盡善之服務有以致之，而其服務所以有此美滿成績，則其電話組織之優良，實與有莫大之關係，茲特以雲飛總接線間之概况略述如次，儻亦讀者所樂聞歟。</p>
<p>最新話機　雲飛總接線間，位於該公司靜安寺站之二樓。其中所裝置之話機，為美國名廠定造之最新出品，其結構之精巧，組織之縝密。與夫管理運用之靈便。滬上殆無出其右者。其代價固昂，然而雲飛為服務於全埠人士計，殊樂於購備之也</p>
<p>紅色電珠　此機計有紅色綠色及白色電珠共三排，紅珠計九顆、代表九線、如某一紅珠發光，即係有電話打來之表示，假定有九處電話，同時打來，所有紅珠，亦即同時發光，雲飛電話三〇一八九號碼雖祇一個，其實却有九線，况接線員訓練有素，應對敏捷，顧客自可隨時接通電話，决無屢接不通之虞。</p>
<p>綠色電珠紅　珠發光，接線員隨即接聽，於是綠珠繼之發光，而該紅珠又可於接得另一電話時發光，以發揮其功用矣，接線員接聽甫畢、立即轉知距離最近之站、放車前往，其靈便迅速，確有鈴聲未斷車已開到之概，雲飛總接線問全部採用科學隔音裝置，故無任何煩囂聲浪足以擾及接線員之視聽，接線員旣可專心壹志於工作，而話機復若斯之精良，宜其對於電話之應接，車輛之指派，無不井然有序，迅速異常也。</p>
<p>白色電珠　白珠裝於對講線上，當分站與總接線間相互通話時，聽筒甫經携取，白珠立即發光，及至對方答話，綠色電珠隨即繼白珠而發光，庶因以發光代替鈴聲，故通話聲浪，非常清晰</p>
<p>專員接線　雲飛總接線問，聘有接線員十二人，分作三班，每班四人，常川駐守，日夜工作，故不論何時致電喚車，靡不如響斯應，隨呌隨到，且極少纏誤或等候接話等情事。</p>
<p>尤足述者，雲飛總管理處盡可於其辦事宅中，隨時以轉話機接通總接線間，而靜聆接線員之應答是否克盡厥職，其一切管理，蓋已完全科學化矣。</p>

<p>衡陽居湘江上流，據粵漢鐵路之中心，為湘桂鐵路之起點。公路四達，輸船通駛，實為四通八達之交通要地。共公路東經江西以達福建；西至貴陽轉入川滇；南通粵桂，北達湖北。水路交通，則以水勢為轉移，冬季水涸，停止航行，其餘三季，均能通航于柏坊長沙衡陽間。然自漢，粵，贛相繼淪陷，此交通要地之與各地交通情形，亦受其影響。鐵路，公路，雖路線仍舊，但已不能暢通，茲就最近情形述之：</p>
<p>（甲）鐵路：（一）粵漢鐵路，現已縮短其路線，南僅通至樂昌，北僅通至株州，中為萊陽，郴縣，衡山等站。票價自衡陽南至萊陽，快車頭等三元六角，二等二元三角，三等一元一角五分。慢車頭等三元，二等二元，三等一元。至郴縣快車，頭等八元二角五分，二等五元三角，三等二元六角五分，慢車頭等七元零五分，二等四元七角，三等二元三角五分。至樂昌快車，頭等十四元五角五分，二等九元四角，三等四元七角；慢車頭等十二元七角，二等八元五角，三等四元二角五分。自衡陽北至衡山，快車頭等三元三角，二等二元一角，三等一元零五分；慢車頭等二元七角，二等一元八角，三等九角。至株州快車頭等七元八角，二等五元，三等二元五角；慢車頭等六元，二等四元四角，三等二元二角。行李運費，逾限每十公斤每公里，收費一厘。班次往返各有快車及慢車一次；快車自衡陽至樂昌約行十一小時，至株洲約行五小時。慢車自衡陽至樂昌約行十五小時；至株州約行五小時半。（二）湘桂線，自衡陽直達桂林北站，中途經黎家坪，冷水灘，興安等站，票價自衡陽至黎家坪頭等五元五角五分，二等三元七角，三等一元八角五分，至冷水灘頭等七元九角五分，二等五元三角，三等二元六角五分。至興安頭等十六元八角，二等十一元二角，三等五元六角，至桂林北站頭等十九元九角五分，二等十元三角，三等六元六角五分。自衡至桂約行十六時半。行李逾重十公斤每公里一厘計算</p>
<p>（乙）公路：（一）衡陽至長沙，長一八四公里，票價九元二角，約行七小時半。（二）衡陽至湘潭，長一三四公里，票價六元七角，約行四小時。（三）衡陽至寶慶，長一三六公里，票價六元八角，行程五小時零十分，（四）經祁陽至零陵，長一五七公里，票價至祁陽五元二角，至零陵七元八角五分。行程到祁陽三小時半，至零陵五小時零十五分。（五）自衡陽東站經萊陽至宜章，長一九三公里，票價至萊陽三元一角，至宜章，九元六角五分，行程至萊陽二小時，至宜章六小時。（六）自衡陽東站至界化隴長二三五公里，票價十一元七角五分。各路免費行李均為二十公斤，逾此以十公斤為單位，每超過十公斤，每公里由負責者，收費六厘五毫，旅客自理六厘。</p>
<p>（三）水路：（一）衡陽至湘潭，由小輪船航行，每晨六時開，票價一元六角，（二）衡陽至祁陽，亦由小輪船航駛，每晨七時開，票價二元，（三）至零陵，輿往祁陽者同船，票價三元。</p>
<p>（四）湘贛聯運通車：除上述水路交通雙外湘南公路局複與江西公路局合辦湘贛聯運通車，自衡陽當日可達江西吉安。每日雙方各開客車三輛，均於晨間五時開行，票價每人二十元四角四分，行程一日，中途在界化隴進膳全程四四〇裏。</p>

<p>八一三戰爭爆發後，長江末，如有維多利亞輪（該輪二百餘噸，並非意國郵船公司行駛外洋之郵船。）行駛於上海浮橋（七丫口）間。該地位於太倉及常熟之間，客貨由此可東至太倉，西轉常熟而轉運至蘇錫各地。當時上海以民食恐慌，內地則日用品異常缺之，故一般商家，往復販運，莫不利市數倍，而輪船公司以極力提高水腳，（米每包運費約一元二角，戰前約僅二角。牛每只運價約需二十餘元。）獲利亦钜，此為戰後小長江航業之最盛時期。去年春，航業界以有利可圖，小公司之成立者，及如雨後春筍，航輪大量增加，航線亦延長至白茆口常陰沙一帶。同時北沙線滸通，樹積，牛洪，靈甸，三和等港，亦相繼開航。在此時期，航輪雖多，以港口亦增，故無論客運貨運，尚不寂寞。當時行駛各輪，有維多利亞，密尼馬勒，亨熙，海德，海宜，常德，福祿，德耀，海康，及怡和太古公司之數輪，共計十餘艘。</p>
<p>迄夏秋之間，新　登場，滸浦口以地利上獨佔優勢，按該地距常熟縣城，僅十餘裏，交通便利，且常熟與鄰縣崑山，均為產米之區，當時陸路阻塞食糧運申，莫不取道滸浦。）貨運驟形發達。每日由該處出口之包子，日有七八千包，斯時直放滸浦口之正班船，有江定，新江南，凱司登，沃勒夫等輪，其他各輪，亦均兼靠該口，總計不下三十餘艘。但航輪既多，竟爭遂烈，水腳因此極度低落，（米每包運價最低時降至三角以下，牛每只運費降至七八元。）始至冬季，客貨改少，且當地禁運米糧出口，以無貨可運，遂至無形停頓。不過新生及張黃兩港（在江北如皋　之南），次第通航，兼之歲暮，大批醃肉豬牛花生等豬油等，紛紛運滬，該港航運，亦會煊赫一時。（即目前本埠所食之豬，大多仍由該港運來。）今春以來，火車汽車，相率通行，且際此青黃接之時，貨運稀少，至各輪相繼停航，目前　行駛者，僅德耀，常德，海宜，海康，凱司登，新江南，及怡太公司之數輪而已。</p>
<h3 id="c91">福特貢獻 <a href="#c91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>本年五種福特車輛，其大小式樣。動力，價格悉合尊意，而其價值則常與福特名字為緣者也，其中福特與林肯判然不同，今社會人士于福特及林肯二者外，對於介乎二者間之各種汽車，亦頗感需要。福特公司麥特陸續製成各種高貴價值寂寞派車，以彌補此種缺陷；而首先問世則為林肯賽飛，此車已將址二汽缸之運用，導入中價車類之車。同時在構造與式樣方面複應用新的原理，令其常居於時代之先，次則有特等福特V八之問世。及今年加入高貴福特集團之新車，即謀克利汽車是，謀克利八汽缸車在較低中價車類中，地位介乎特等福特林肯賽飛二者之間。而其所具之價值，惟有採用特殊方法與資源之廠家如福特公司者始能制之。上述五種汽車均較其他廠家出品為五佳，值得購置。</p>
<p>福特修理之服務，為世界最火修車組織之一。吾人任到何處，均有福特修車之服務，而此種服務又非常周到滿意。今者福特之修車服務，在美國　即已有數千處，此外可靠之停車所及修理站，又有數千之多，一律憑有真正福特零件之標識。各地福特經理處均備有特定之福特修車工具及設備，精准異常，極為可靠，即省時間，又省金錢，所用零件均系真正福特出品，其品質之優越，尺寸之精密，與原車中所用者毫無二致，而福特廠方所　定之方法，則又使修理之費用至為輕微。</p>

<p>沙遜又起扒結</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠再降二五、紐約銀價亦再縮半分、倫敦生金未更、匯況英美勿動、對滬大〇六二五、對法長二生丁、美對英無亦、對滬小一角五分、對法降〇六二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金六便士五九三七五、美匯十二元八四三七五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、開後某銀公司突來拋塞、是以市勢穩定、計銀公司賣予美行大通某行現貨美匯十二元八七五、治滙豐掛牌揭曉、仍無變化、及白銀平衡稅揭曉免微，時因各大洋行結款頗繁，且西商沙遜扒意亦濃，加之英美等各外銀行扳價不肯廉賣，至　勢步緊，計外行滙豐麥加利及華行等塞予洋行沙遜現貨英金六便士五六二五，繼而美行大通某行及華行等亦售予洋行沙遜現貨美匯為十二元八一二五，將近午刻，僅有港匯買賣，經洋行扒結東方現貨價只四十四元二五，為狀亦軟，迨午收銀行現貨賣價英金六便士五六二五，美匯十二元七八一二五。</p>

<p>昨日現金　赤暗盤市況，僅有上午半天行市，盡下午所做交易，照例須在隔夜交割，因交割逢封關期內，故經同業議決，停市三天半，至七月四日（即下週二）照常開市，唯昨上午變動，雖只有十三元差度，但情況仍難脫恍惚，初開因北幫複起賣風，一度曾退達二千五百四十元低盤，嗣以某銀號代外行頻來吸收，且外匯內盤緊俏，市勢反動向上，曾激昂至二千五百九十三元高峰，延至午刻因現金號等吐售，再回挫至二千五百八十八元收盤，午後場外　開又回高至二千五百九十五元左右，結果照午後收軋跌二元，而實際上則反軋漲五元光景，半天交易尚旺，約四百餘兩，銀樓飾金未見變動，海關金與中英純金等一致未更。</p>
<p>赤無大出入</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開北幫賣意殷濃，且散戶納胃不健，致開市即做低五元，計證券幫代北幫塞予銀樓幫五十兩，價二千五百八十五元，嗣進者更缺，傾疲五元，某錢兌業亦代北幫賣予銀樓幫及某銀號各五十兩，價則相同，時某銀號吸力仍強，而北幫已止塞觀望，且關外匯　　市勢頻轉向上，某銀號又進銀樓幫及錢兌業各五十兩價八十三元，此後賣方供意殊淡，瞬即飛　七元，某銀號進銀樓幫二十兩，價為九十元，時散戶進意亦濃，價又價又抬高三元，錢兌業進金號十兩，價為九十三元，此後某現金號突然來吐售，　勢轉平，現金號　予錢兌業五十兩，價九十元，後某銀號又進現金號三十兩，價九十二元（開某銀號所進大致代外行吸收），將近午刻，忽稍下疲，掀低四元，某銀號代客售予錢兌業二十兩，價二千五百八十八無，為午收價，午後因交割適值對開期內，故經同業議決休業無市，然開場外已步高至二千五百九十五元左右，藍外匯續緊之故，若照午收之二千五百八十八元，結果則較上日疲落二元，而實際上則軋漲四五元，半天十三元上落，現金號之本牌金售出價二千六百元，收逾二千五百八十五元，現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景，據詢均鮮做關。</p>
<p>飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出，因　赤鮮少變幻，故均未更動，計大同行仍懸原價二百六十三元，新同行為二百六十一元，收進二百五十五元。</p>
<p>中英純金不動</p>
<p>二十九日倫敦電，英純金每盎斯未更，計仍為七鎊八先令六辦士半，致中央銀行之中國現金收買價亦仍屬一千二百十二元六角，掛牌海關金仍平，計二元三角九分六厘，上海標準金價亦呆定於一千二百〇七元九角。</p>

<p>昨匯劃票據貼現率，猛烈下落，因銀行上半年度結算已屆，有需現鈔者早於上數日已貼出收進，故昨市反形從過於求，每千元之貼率，由九十元光景，步低至七十五元，下午更不支，退至七十二元半，比前日竟傾跌十九元半，更詢七月四日起銀行開市，銀錢業將施用同業匯劃，整數取現鈔需要當少。貼水下跌亦一影響，錢業公會之拆息亦見掛低二分，早午兩市均掛二角雲。</p>

<p>昨日英純金與英美匯兌俱未更動，本埠外匯，因銀行辦理決算，洋行結款甚殷，日銀行及西商納胃亦健，外銀行供給不暢，市況軟弱，結果英匯為六辦士五三一二五，較上日緊〇六二五，美匯為十二元七角五分，亦緊一二五，　赤開盤因銀行結帳期屆，明日起休業三天，浮多紛起了結，匯票雖緊　赤反松，只做二千五百八十五元低盤，錢兌業等納胃呆鈍，降達八十元最低價，金號等趁低吸收，盤旋於九十元左右，午收為二千五百八十八元，較上日下跌二元，下午交易未做開，惟買意活躍者吸納頗殷，暗盤成交價漲達九十六元，外幣英美金鎊需要頗殷，英美金票，銀錢業補充頭寸，需要更暢，市價高抬頗多，香港法郎等票需要亦殷，多上漲由金票亦　，晚市九角九分，朝鮮票升為九角一分，公會交易未盛，勤泰出鎮與進美金票五百元，祥泰出鎮與進美金票五百元，仁泰出鎮與進美金票一百元，昨日市價，英金鎊升二角，英金票升四角，美金鎊升五角，美金票升一角八分，香港票升一分，法郎票升二厘，坎拿大及菲律賓票各升一角，其他各帶俱未更動。</p>

<h3 id="c129">敎員十九人來函　迫切的呼籲 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>希望投資者設立消費合作社　並舉辦平民食堂與平民宿舍</p>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我們都是中學的敎員，每月大多有七十元左右的收入，依社會地位和月薪數額來說，雖然比上不足，却還比下有餘。我們大多是有父母妻子的，自從戰後，上海的生活程度是日趨高漲了，這七十元左右的收入，要對付一家四五口人的生活費用，實在感到萬分困難，單就房租一項說，我們十九個中每月房租平均數是二十五元四角，其中有一個人是二房東，有三個人住的倒還是戰前租來的房子，但這數目已呑去了我們全部收入的三分之一以上。然而我們知道這是一個非常的時期，國家多難，正要我們節約，有三位還每月出三元錢養一個難民，大家依然刻苦擔起這家庭的擔子。但比這更不幸的事接着來了，馬電一到上海，隔天醒來，彷彿到了另一個世界，物價飛漲了。我們十九個人在五天後的一個晚上，開了一次談話會，討論應付今後生活的方策：算盤一撥，大家都瞪着眼睛，今後的生活起碼比過去的要提高二成半！這呌我們怎麼辦？到內地去，我們願意，但一家老小如何應付呢？（有二個單身人已決定走了。）經過我們大家討論之後，想出一個辦法，這辦法並不是專為我們而設，牠還可以裨益大多數人，於是決定寫下來，送給r春秋」，讓大家共同討論，共同推進。</p>
<p>消費合作社　我們想到創辦生活必需品的消費合作社。再沒有一種辦法能比合作社對我們更有好處了。依我們最老實的估計，我們每月七十元的收入，被奸商和二房東剝削的，起碼要達五分之一，甚至還在五分之一以上。同時還有一種痛苦，就是物價變動無定，米貴了，多費五塊錢買米，於是沒有零錢化，別的東西更買不起。有誰曉得米店奸商究竟賺了我們多少血汗錢！假如有人創辦一個合作社，販了米來，因為大批買，價錢便宜，同時又因為合作社是為自己社員的利益設立，不會操縱價格，頂多收那麼一點辦事人的手續費，那麼我們實在可以得到許多的便宜。這只是一例。柴，炭，煤，油，鹽，等等亦全可設立消費合作社。而這種組織的成立還可以養成互助互濟廉潔奉公的精神，而這精神在目前孤島上正是最最缺乏的。</p>
<p>自然經費的來源是一個問題，但我們可以要求富裕同胞或是銀行界來投資。有錢人因為覺有得錢無處化。拚命做投機生意，銀行界尤其如此，假如我們有正當用途，要求他們投資，並不是不可能的。同時我們社員們還可以人股，每人繳納的數目雖然不多，但集起來却是一個整數。我們覺得限制米價，只是消極的辦法，設立消費合作社，才是積極的辦法。我們應該靠自己的力量，來維護我們自己的生活！</p>
<p>我們相信每一大街堂，每一家大公司，每一家大學校，甚至像你們貴報館，都可以作為一個單位，都可以成立這種消費合作社。只要是有利的，那怕別人不加入呢？那怕會辦不成呢？我們不大懂得合作社的原理，上面只是一個簡略的原則，甚至母寗說是一個迫切的要求。我們希望大家中下層的人們，能多多加以考慮，參加討論，這是為着我們自身的利益呀！</p>
<p>除這之外，我們還有兩個建議，一個是平民食堂，一個是平民宿舍。</p>
<p>平民食學堂與平民</p>
<p>宿舍假如在目前來一個大規模的平民食堂和平民宿舍，我們相信，一定小會虧本的。我們希望有餘錢的人，起來設立平民食堂和平民宿舍，而最好是兩租界當局自己來籌辦。我們只要清潔衛生，並不要求可口舒服。如果這種食堂與宿舍能廣汎設立起來，一定能够生意興隆，而且增加社會福利，此所謂一舉兩得。</p>

<p>以上就是我們迫切的呼籲。上海民生問題是越來越嚴重了，這是應當馬上加以解决的。許多人已為了生活的壓迫。做了國家民族的罪人，許多人為了生活的壓迫，正被迫做着搶刦掠奪的非法勾當，更有許多人正在無望的掙扎中。編者先生，你願意把我們這篇信發表出來嗎？如果能引起一塲討諭，推動社會人士和負責當局的注意，起而創辦實行，不是大有帮助於人羣社會，甚至國家的麼？專此，謹致敬禮！</p>

<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Little　Princess”　二十世紀福斯出品</p>
<p>上海自從淪為「孤島」以來，神聖的敎育界竟然發生了光怪陸離的現象，而且繼續着有向更壞的途徑上發展的趨勢。這種不良的現象，自然是跟隨着戰事而來的，不過以負着重大使命的敎育界，而與操縱米價，抬高房租的奸商們競爭，這實在是抗戰中最大的損失。</p>
<p>再看看遷移到後方去的許多大中小學，他們不怕空襲，他們自己建造房屋，在讀書之外，積極地參加後方工作，每一個學校，每一個學生，都繼做了抗戰中最有力量的一個單位。上海的敎育界是應該和後方響應的，至少，它應該做到為敎育而敎育的程度，「救救　學生！」這樣的呼聲總不致充耳不聞的。</p>
<p>「小公主」的故事，雖然是擊於秀蘭鄧波兒父女的悲歡離合。，但是它抨擊腐敗的敎育和校長的以學校為斂錢工具，是頗有力量的。如因為秀蘭鄧波兒是陸軍大尉的女兒，進校的時候，十分優待，及至聽到大尉陣亡的消息，校長馬上暴露了木來的勢利面目，將秀蘭鄧波兒打入廚房。</p>
<p>同時，學校對於軍人遺族予以特別優待，我們也已看到這樣的命令，可是得鄭重聲明的，以現中國的情形來和「小公主」比，自然是失之毫厘，差以千里的，因為英軍的奉命出征，和中國的抗戰，恰是一個反比例。不過這史可以使「孤島」敎育界猛省，許多生命為國家犧牲了，你們所負的任務呢？</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒在這戲里盡量發揮了她的演技，尤其和父親分別及最後遇見父親兩塲戲，都能控制悲劇的情緖，由淡而濃，而達於頂點，就是整個戲中，也一掃過去的「積習」，恢復了孩子的天眞爛漫。</p>
<p>導演者的成就，可以分以下四點來說。（一）寫秀蘭鄧波兒的從優待到執僕役，他是用着對比的手法的：如進來時校長領到一間華美的屋子裏去，吃版趕走了另一個女生讓秀蘭坐在她的旁邊；知道了大尉死耗，校長馬上驅散慶視秀蘭生辰的同伴，移居到小樓上，並罰使執役，這樣不但加强觀衆對秀蘭的同情，而更暴露校長的勢利。（二）秀蘭父女分別，和最後見面的兩塲戲，前者他用秀蘭突然從窗前跑回來抱住大尉，及臨走時候，秀蘭對着窗而祇聽見關門的聲音和馬蹄聲：後者，秀蘭兩次和父親失之交臂，而突然相逢，導演者把情緒氣氛是抓得十分强固的。（三）秀蘭的夢境果然是弱者的洩氣，但這樣能使印僕和秀蘭鄧波兒聯結起來，未始沒有理由的，被侮辱和被損害的人們聯結起來，才是最有力量的集團。（四）因為秀蘭鄧波兒的能歌善舞，這裏也穿揷了兩節短短的歌舞，但是都很適當，尤其是在傷兵醫院中秀蘭尋不着父親的時候。</p>

<p>— 沈宥</p>
<p>女彈詞人物誌（一）</p>
<p>按：紀載女彈詞最早典籍，可考的，有雲閒不覊生之「詞媛姓氏錄」。此書約成於淸光緖五年（一八七九）左右，申報館刋。縷愁僊史蔡爾康，在「申報館書目續集」（一八七九）中，曾說明其內容：</p>
<p>「是錄專採海上女彈詞之姓氏彙而錄之，並採歷年所載詩詞評語，分隸於下。夫自海舶通市以後，滬上貿易之盛，甲於天下，而脂圍粉藪，亦天下莫之與京，其中有所謂書寓，長三，么二諸名目。等妓也，而書寓身分，自謂略高大，有鄙夷一切之槪。故風雅中人，猶津津樂道之。……」</p>
<p>惜此書雖見「續目」，迄無法訪求。據畹淸香留夢室主「淞南夢影錄」所云：此書似未會刊行。「夢影錄卷三云：「朱子美茂才之詞媛姓氏錄，則第叙靑樓，梨棗未謀，難傳久遠。「夢影錄」成於光緖九年（一八八三），在「續目」後四年出，其言當可信。「姓氏錄一而外，別無其他專紀女彈詞書籍，故欲考當時女彈詞全部人物，在今日殊有難能。</p>
<p>王弢瀛壖雜誌」（一八七四）卷五，於當時女彈詞，會有簡略叙述，可謂為今日所能獲得之最早的關於女彈詞及其人物之文獻。</p>
<p>其詞云：</p>
<p>平話始於柳敬亭，然皆鬚眉男子為之，近時如曹春江，馬如飛，皆其矯矯傑出者。道咸以來，始尙女子，珠喉玉貌，脆管么絃，能令聽者魂銷。向時多在城中土地堂羅神殿。日午宵初，聊為消遣。徐月娥，汪雪卿，皆以艷名噪一時。兵燹以後，皆在城外。推為此中翹楚者，則如袁雲仙，吳素卿，朱幼香，兪翠娥，吳麗琴，並皆佳妙。今時繼起者，則又有朱麗卿，陸岑仙，陳芝香，金玉珍，張翠霞，吐屬雅雋，頡頑前秀。每一登塲，滿座傾倒。其聲如百囀春鶯，醉心蕩魄，曲終人遠，猶覺餘音繞標，此又於裙釵中別開生面者矣。或為集句贈之云：「玉台閒詠新詩句，金屋難藏沒字碑」，是猶不失為閏閣風雅歟？其有盲女彈詞，則所不取，雙瞳旣失，而猶以聲藝售此，則地獄之變相也</p>
<p>此處之所謂「肓女」，雖為王弢所「不取」，然在乾隆以前，實為「女彈詞」之主體。故事實上，女彈詞之發軔，實在乾隆以前，特聚族而居，成為「正規職業，」在乾嘉而後耳。李家瑞「說詞彈」，曾考之云：</p>
<p>：從來以彈詞為職業者，亦以女子為多。明朝時就已有這風氣。三風十愆記記常熟丐戶中有草頭娘者，喜吹簫鼓琴，工博戲，能誧詩，更熟二十一史，精彈詞。……淸初崑曲中有女彈詞一齣，叙述彈詞女郞故事，是必先有女子彈詞流行，然後產生此種故事也。</p>

<p>— 顧蘭君</p>
<p>寫一些從業的經歷與感想</p>
<p>電影演員們的拍戲生活，在一般人的理想中，大概都以為是很愉快，也是最優開不過的。有些影迷同志，更多懷着熱烈的心願，為此不勝企幕地把它當做唯一的生活對象。不錯，只須遵從導演指揮，演出怎樣怎樣的動作表情，這還不是易事嗎？其實這只是不知道個中甘苦的浮面觀察，實際上的情形，正是一言難盡的一種極難苦的工作。</p>
<p>我從十五歲那年開始從業電影以後，到現在已歷近七年了。在此近七年的過程中，片子既經演得不少，種種甜酸苦辣的況味，也早有過了較多的體驗；簡括一句話，可說是甜的成分委實極少，而苦的情味，却來得太多了</p>
<p>這裏，我想約略寫一些這類拍戲的經歷感想。但又感這工作較拍戲更難，因為自己難得動筆，向來未敢輕試。好在即使要是一再易稿的話，那却比較攝影場　的多拍NG鏡頭是容易不少了！</p>
<p>攝影場好像是大戲櫃，攝影場上的工作是眞夠苦惱的，尤其在這炎威逼人的夏天裏。這地方就像一個龐大的鐵櫃，為要隔絕外聲響，免至妨擾收音工作起見，場子的週邊，除似鋼墻鐵壁那樣業得又堅又厚之外，還得另加隔音板與張滿了用以減少回生反響的許多布毯。當在導演先生的「開麥拉」號令喊起之前，更將幾處進出的門戶，全都閉得密勿通風，而上下左右的燈光，亦即放出極強烈的光芒，全集中在演員身上，猛力照射。「試一遍」「再試一遍」。在導演指揮下經過了迭番演習，才能正式開拍。處於這樣悶熱難忍的情形下澈夜工作着，週身的汗珠子像雨一般的親瀉，燈光在皮膚上灼得發燙作痛；這苦楚只有自己知道而無從訴說的。至於在銀幕上的收視；平均算來，這麼整夜天，苦幹結果，所能映現於觀眾眼旋的，也許是映不到二十分鐘！</p>
<p>前幾天，家姊梅君買了一個淡灰色的手提皮夾。我們姊妹倆一起在拍演「蘭蘭飛屍」。她將這皮夾帶上攝影場去，誰知道不上兩天工夫，就給那燈光逼射得面目全非，原來的淡灰色竟會很快地變成了淺紅的色澤。梅君姊姊在有此驚奇發現時，忙著給我察視而表示深深的惋惜，我更不禁引起了「物猶如此」的悲感，儘在默默呆想，險些兒眞的掉下淚來。</p>

<p>我麼全體團員，也有一位少女派來做嚮導。我們單獨行動的時候，或者去購買物件因語言的隔膜而發生困難之時，常常在身旁人葉中，會走出一位善說中國話的俄國人來，他來替你當義務翻譯，解除困難，他是誰呢？怎麼遇得這樣的巧呢？</p>
<p>有一次我在一家商店購物，一個女店員她指着我手上所御的金戒指，她操着純碎的英語問無：『這是什麽？有什麽用場？』我回答：『這是我結婚的戒指，紀念我夫人的。』想不到他竟向我要求：『請你立刻把他棄掉罷！』我很詫異的問她：『爲什麽理由呢？』她說：『男與女的愛情，是「自然的」，「純潔」的，兩情的結合，祗要情意相投。有一方面認為在結婚之初，先要仗著這齷齪的黃金，作為兩人愛情的聯繫，已經是不自然，不純潔了！而且事先已存了破裂之象，所以我勸你把他棄掉！』我聽完這小店員的言論，倒也覺得頗有見地。無奈我終未能割愛，把約指棄掉！並非我吝嗇不捨這區區的黃金，因為這約指，並非紀念結婚的，乃是我平生第一個情人，自法國巴黎給我帶來的紀念，她雖然已離敷有夫，我却如見其人，永遠帶在指間，直到我寫這篇文章的時候。</p>
<p>蘇聯的少女，既具有健美的體格，更富於真摯的熱情。當梅先生舞台上表演的時候，觀眾中的婦女，常常發出「梅蘭芳！我愛你！」熱烈的呼聲！（在美國也曾有過）尤其是在莫斯科國家劉院公演最後的一夕，劇畢，觀眾不肯離座，幕起幕落十餘此，有一位少女在高呼「梅蘭芳我愛你！」之後，懷抱鮮花一束，登台贈與梅氏，他是誰呢？他就是御任不久蘇聯外交委員長李維諾夫氏的令愛。</p>
<p>我們在莫斯科裏演完畢，再到列甯格勒公演，演畢於四月十二日晨，複返莫斯科，將由此登車回國，而蘇聯國家劇院Bolshoi　Theatre的經歷忽要求：務必在國家劇院再作最後一次之公演，據說是因為政府一部份高級人員，要看一看中國戲的變術。</p>

<p>鬧得烏煙瘴氣的天津事件發生以後，有許多人，都從那裏逃向上海來了。本文所說的這個人，昨天也有信給她的同夥，說不久就要回來。其實，天津的英法租界，固然已被封鎖，至於上海是否安全，恐怕也不過五十步與百步之比，她又何必回來呢。然而，（廿九）　不然，據她信上說，她在天津，是在一家仙樂舞場伴舞，如今那舞場業已停閉了，不用你個說，她的舞票取入也沒有了，再說，她的爹媽現在都在上海，所以天津租界就是不被封鎖，她也應該回來。話又說得回來，要是天津租界不被封鎖，仙樂舞場也不會停業，所以她的回來，也可算是受天津事件的簡介影響。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Japanese troops from Chaoan are secretly reinforcing westward from Fuyang, pressing forward. Simultaneously, multiple Japanese shallow-draft vessels have gathered at Guanbu, sailing upstream along the tributaries of the Han River, attempting to invade Jieyang. Large Chinese forces have deployed to intercept them. The Fourth War Zone Military Law Enforcement Supervisory Department has also dispatched senior inspectors to the front lines to supervise the execution of combat orders by various units. Furthermore, it is reported that 2,000 Japanese troops from Taiping have been transferred to reinforce Chao Shan. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) A Chongqing telegram states that the Japanese army is now adopting a new strategy: a main offensive against Shaanxi, a supporting offensive in central Hubei, a feigned offensive in Hunan and Jiangxi, naval harassment in southern China, and continued efforts to eliminate guerrillas in southern Jiangsu, northern Jiangsu, and central China. It is also rumored that they have set a deadline of early July to occupy Zhejiang. The Japanese troops who landed on Chuanshi Island outside the Okou River have retreated. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to today's Japanese sources, the Japanese side has delayed its blockade of Fuzhou at the request of the British Navy. It has now decided to postpone the blockade for several days to allow British ships to return to Fuzhou to evacuate British nationals. Once the British evacuation is complete, Fuzhou will be completely blockaded. As for the Okou River estuary, it is already completely under blockade. (30th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) At noon on the 29th, multiple Japanese motorboats carrying 200 to 300 Japanese soldiers suddenly attacked Yidouwu (between Changmen and Chuanshi Island) off the Min River estuary, attempting to land. The Chinese garrison waited until they approached the shore before launching a head-on attack. The Japanese soldiers, unable to escape, were killed in significant numbers, and several Japanese boats were also destroyed. The Japanese soldiers, realizing the difficulty of success, retreated. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Fuzhou) After being repelled by Chinese forces, Japanese troops attacking Dongyang Island, part of Pingtan County, again launched an attack on Guanyin'ao in Pingtan on the afternoon of the 29th, under the cover of Japanese warships and aircraft, attempting a forced landing. They were again repelled by Chinese forces and fled back to Japanese warships. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) A report from the Chinese front lines in Shantou states that a Chinese detachment, ordered to conduct a rearguard action in Chaozhou to cover the retreat of the main force, is now likely in dire straits, as their retreat route has been cut off by the appearance of Japanese troops northwest of Chaozhou. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuhuang: The units tenaciously defending Chaoan County City launched several sorties from the city on the 28th, killing many Japanese soldiers on the spot. The Japanese continuously launched fierce attacks, with intense artillery bombardment. The Chinese defenders still braved death to fight back, engaging in hand-to-hand combat as the Japanese approached. Casualties mounted on both sides. By the afternoon, Japanese aircraft swarmed in, dropping bombs and strafing, turning most of the city into ashes. The Chinese army still used the broken walls and ruins for cover, demanding the greatest possible price from the Japanese with a spirit of certain death. By evening, the number of Japanese troops increased, and a large part of them rushed into the city. The isolated Chinese forces withdrew from Chaozhou City in street-to-street fighting, moving to the Yixi North District area north of the city to await reinforcements and launch a counterattack. Chaoan thus fell completely into Japanese hands. (29th dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to a news report from Hong Kong this morning, a British naval detachment has landed in Fuzhou at the request of the British Consul in Fuzhou to protect British nationals. (30th Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a Chinese spokesman, the Japanese occupation of Chaozhou is purely aimed at protecting Shantou and is definitely not a preparation for attacking Shaoguan. If the Japanese army wanted to attack Shaoguan, they should attack from Zengcheng and Conghua to avoid the intervening mountainous areas. As for the current Japanese military actions in the Shantou area, they are nothing more than an attempt to consolidate their position in that area but will definitely not penetrate deep inland. First, the Japanese army will not go deep, so that they can use naval guns as protection. Second, outside Chaozhou, the terrain is favorable to the defenders and unfavorable to the Japanese mechanized units. According to the Chinese side, the silver stored in the Shantou branch of the Guangdong Provincial Bank was transported out in advance without any loss. However, there are silver mines near Shantou, so the Japanese occupation of Shantou can also be regarded as Mitsui's attempt to seize this silver mine. (30th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Guangzhou) This morning, Japanese troops on Chuanshi Island fired artillery at the Chinese coast. Many Chinese fishermen, women, and children on the island were abducted onto Japanese warships. (30th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news received here, a small number of British naval personnel have landed in Fuzhou from the British gunboat "Grasshopper" and are stationed at the British Consulate to protect the lives and property of British nationals. It is reported that the "Grasshopper" gunboat was recently transferred from the Yangtze River because of its light weight, it can navigate shallow waters. It is known that there are currently 26 Japanese warships in Fuzhou. (30th Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Military sources here confirm that Chaozhou has fallen. Chinese forces are now near Chaozhou, awaiting reinforcements and preparing for a counterattack. It is said that the Japanese side paid a high price in this battle of Chaozhou, with heavy casualties. (30th Huitong dispatch)</p>

The reason for the rapid progress of the Chinese counteroffensive against Guangzhou this time is purely that most of the Japanese troops in Guangzhou have been transferred to attack Shantou.

<p>(Hong Kong) According to official US sources here, Japanese aircraft bombed Fuzhou yesterday and destroyed Xiehe Middle School, which is run by American missionaries. Fortunately, no Americans were injured or killed. The US side has lodged a strong protest with the Japanese side. Xiehe Middle School is a school run by Americans. The US side had previously notified the Japanese side of its location and had painted two large American flags on the roof, which the Japanese aircraft should have been able to see. Furthermore, the Japanese aircraft flew very low during the bombing, so there was no possibility of misunderstanding. However, one bomb struck the west side of the school building and immediately started a fire, causing the entire school to be burned to the ground. Mr. and Mrs. Biling, who were in charge of the school, fortunately took refuge in an air-raid shelter and were unharmed. (30th Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">The Knotty Problem of Foreign Exchange in Shanghai <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>It has been nearly ten days since the Chinese Ministry of Finance implemented the Ma policy. Observing the past ten days, one cannot help but recognize that there has been considerable achievement in some respects, such as the decline in commodity prices, the sharp drop in foreign merchant stocks, and the long position of foreign exchange (the British exchange rate once reached seven pence, and the US exchange rate also reached thirteen yuan six two five). Moreover, the sale of foreign exchange by Japanese merchant banks in the days approaching the end of last month further reflects their inner distress. However, looking at it from another perspective, the method of limiting cash withdrawals still does not escape the nature of "treating the head when it hurts, and the foot when it aches," and is "more than enough to treat the symptoms, but not enough to treat the root cause." Currently, the contraction of legal tender has caused a reactionary decline in the market, but capital flight is not prevented by this, and Chinese merchant banks inevitably pay more than they receive in deposits. Fortunately, the black market for foreign exchange does not have a large supply at all, and foreign banks can also refuse to open new accounts; otherwise, it is very likely to create a situation of driving fish into deep water. Although hoarding of cash is not a great harm unless it involves large sums, waiting for the "storm" to gradually pass, it will be seen that the position of legal tender will still gradually loosen; and the trend of falling commodity prices will not last, and there is even the possibility of rising; it is not unexpected that this will be intensified, creating a higher record. Even regarding the Japanese merchant banks' obtaining foreign exchange, it can indeed be given a considerable blow at present, but in the future, when the position of legal tender is slightly wider, they will inevitably still be active!</p>
<p>Furthermore, speaking of the content of this withdrawal restriction, we have also pointed out the disadvantage of it to industrial and commercial deposits. Apart from the payment of wages, which can be applied to the company for a special withdrawal review committee, there is still no remedy for the rest of the legitimate needs of industry and commerce. If this continues to be handled in the same way as ordinary depositors, industry and commerce will naturally continue to be affected. What should be noted is that the current environment is different from that of August 13th. At that time, it was originally a slack season for industry and commerce, so when the war broke out, the entire city's industry and commerce were at a standstill. Even if you only allow 5% of withdrawals per week, with a maximum amount of 150 yuan, it did not matter much. But what is it like now? First, it is the active season for industry and commerce, and second, it is the appearance of silk, silkworms, beans, and wheat; therefore, in the past ten days, everyone has been expecting supplementary measures, almost like birds waiting to be fed. Although the issuance of a new transfer of 50 million yuan will soon become a reality, it is only an adjustment of chips within the banking industry; even if it has some indirect relationship with industry and commerce, it is very small. Even if another "transfer certificate" can be issued, which can circulate in the market, and at the same time we also assume that its circulation does not hinder the unified national policy of legal tender, it cannot be realized in the short term.</p>
<p>As for the measures for restricting cash withdrawals this time, the financial authorities also said that it is a temporary measure, which can be cancelled after the market stabilizes slightly in the future. In essence, the nature is originally like this; but in our humble opinion, if the National Government authorities have the determination to eliminate the threat to legal tender, the key does not lie in the tightening or loosening of currency; even if it is necessary to focus on currency in order to deal with storms, and to implement currency contraction, it must also be recognized as a tactical strategy. Treating the symptoms is temporary, for emergency; if the effect of the tactical strategy is estimated to be too high, and the period of treating the symptoms is allowed to be too long, then on the one hand, the habit of legal tender hoarding and outflow will become irreversible, and on the other hand, Shanghai's finances will be threatened instead. Because restricting cash withdrawals is not originally a prohibition of cash withdrawals, the result of the accumulation of time and space will make the restriction completely ineffective. This is the inevitable thing in principle, even speaking of the tactical strategy of restricting cash withdrawals itself. It must be known that the current problem still lies in foreign exchange. The morbidity of foreign exchange lies in Shanghai's black market. Without a way to control Shanghai's black market for foreign exchange, how can restricting cash withdrawals in Shanghai be effective; those who evade will still evade, those who speculate will still speculate, and only the general legitimate industrial and commercial operators will be sacrificed. The key lies here, and treating the root cause is very difficult; we should not just talk about high-sounding words, and the authorities cannot succeed empty-handed either; but the authorities' current policy on the black market, at least, still has room for modification depending on the circumstances. For example, for the black market for foreign exchange, under a certain method, adopt an application system, so that the great power is not held upside down. Of course, this method cannot achieve the ideal state of foreign exchange; but it can directly limit the excessive consumption of foreign exchange, and indirectly prevent capital flight and Japanese purchase. It is better to make reality close to the ideal than to have an ideal that cannot dominate reality!</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army Ministry stated today that Britain has adopted a hostile policy towards Japan since the Great War. Therefore, in the Tianjin incident, unless Britain changes its policy of hostility towards Japan and supports Japan's goals in China, no resolution can be expected, whether in Tokyo or locally. The spokesman also said that if the Tianjin issue is not resolved, incidents similar to Tianjin will continue to emerge in China. "We cannot forget Britain's attempts to weaken Japan's power, oppose Japan's past actions in 'Manchuria,' and its current actions in China." At the same time, the British side often arbitrarily fabricates news and confuses rumors regarding Japan's current actions in China, deliberately increasing Japan's difficulties. Therefore, it is extremely difficult to distinguish whether the current anti-Japanese propaganda in China is initiated by Chongqing or instigated by the British. According to the spokesman, the current Tianjin incident was also caused by the British. "Since the British continue to expand their assistance to Chongqing, the Japanese army has no choice but to take such measures to thoroughly promote British introspection." As for the British assistance to the Chongqing government in North China, intending to disrupt the peace and economic situation in North China, the facts are countless. The spokesman concluded that Japan's patience has now reached the extreme of unbearable. (30th Associated Press dispatch)</p>

The securities market anticipated the suspension, so the price of the 1913 Reorganization Loan has fallen by sixteen pounds in the past month. The Chinese government has always had a clear reputation for creditworthiness with creditors, but is now suspending payments due to unavoidable circumstances. Most of the customs and salt taxes have now been seized by Japan, and foreign exchange problems have arisen recently, so it is currently difficult to predict whether there will be a way to continue payments.

<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax delivered a very important speech at the Foreign Affairs Association this evening. He said, "The rule of law and order must be preserved and defended, and we must be prepared to fight if necessary. Therefore, if there is any further aggression, we will resolutely fulfill our commitments and resist with all our might." He also stated that Britain would not succumb to slander and force, and that the determination to resist aggression was paramount. To this day, Germany has isolated itself. Economically, it pursues a policy of self-sufficiency; politically, its policies make other countries uneasy; and culturally, it adheres to racial extremism. Because of all this, Germany has reached a state of complete isolation. Whether this situation can be changed depends on the attitude of the German government in the future. If it can change course, a policy of cooperation can be substituted at any time. As far as economic issues are concerned, they cannot be solved by a policy of isolation. This is true for other countries, and it is also true for Germany. It is futile to shout for peace when peace is being lost. If we want to change course and find a solution to the current problems, we must reduce the preparations for war and promise that all countries will have the freedom to enjoy their independence. Otherwise, talking about solutions will be empty words and will not help in reality. British policy is based on two basic goals: one is the determination to resist force, and the other is the recognition that all countries in the world are willing to lay the foundation for peace. If we can be sure that other countries share the same sentiment and have the sincerity to find a peaceful solution, then I can say that all the problems that make the world restless can be submitted for discussion."

But today, the threat of force makes the world restless, so Britain's current task is to resist aggression. There are things that the British people recognize but that are not fully understood by the people of other countries, such as the fact that if there is another aggression, the British people are determined to immediately exert all their efforts to fulfill their promises to resist aggression. Some countries whose people hold international views that differ from ours often try to distort our actions and motives. We are filled with anger and desire when we read their malicious misunderstandings, knowing that they are false and knowing that those who make these statements also know that their statements are untrue. We do not turn a blind eye to such events, and we are not indifferent to the provocative insults to our people in distant places. I can tell you immediately that Britain is not prepared to succumb to defamation or force. All kinds of provocations against what our people value and are determined to uphold only unite us, increase our determination, and strengthen the ties between us and those who share the same sentiments and desires. A large part of the world has abandoned the old principles of conduct and the norms of humanity. We are all amazed by what they are doing. The rules of conduct between countries are like the rules of conduct between people, regarded as nothing and almost completely destroyed. Since our goals are often misunderstood, we should reiterate them in bold and clear terms. Our first interest is to stop aggression. For this reason, we are in contact with other countries to defend against common dangers. This arrangement has no other intention than defense. Those who say that this is intended to isolate or surround Germany and Italy, and to attempt to prevent these two countries from having the living space necessary for their national existence, what is the truth? Germany is isolating itself economically with its self-sufficiency policy, politically with its policy of constantly conflicting with other countries, and culturally with its racialist ideology, and is far from a completely isolated position. If a person deliberately isolates himself, then the responsibility cannot be blamed on others. If this isolation continues, its inevitable consequences will inevitably become stronger and more obvious. We do not want to see any men, women, or children suffer from exploitation. If this phenomenon exists, it is not our fault. Those who can end this policy of cooperation depend on whether the German government continues to use its own isolation methods.</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary spoke of "living space," saying, "This policy cannot be solved by getting more land." The only solution is to handle domestic affairs wisely and adjust and improve foreign relations. A country can expand its national wealth and raise its standard of living by gaining the trust of its neighbors. Then, international goods can circulate easily. If a country is determined to destroy the independent existence of its weak neighbors, the result will be counterproductive. As for the so-called "living space," if it means destroying the existence of neighboring countries, then Huang Guo will reject it. Belgium, the Netherlands, and England have all proven that the so-called overpopulation can be prevented by productive work. Economically speaking, the world is closely organized, and no country can hope to harm others and benefit itself. Germany cannot hope to solve its economic problems by isolation. There is plenty of room for cooperation to include the space required for a larger economic life, making it accessible to all countries. As far as Britain is concerned, Britain is prepared to cooperate. If the world is organized according to this outline, then Germany or Italy need not worry about their security. However, this kind of national society cannot be built on force, because people live in fear of violence and have to waste their resources preparing to resist violence. It is useless to shout for peace without peace, and it is useless to talk about solutions without reducing military affairs and acknowledging the protection of national independence. At this time, militarism is blocking the road to a solution and filling the world with a spirit of hostility and harm. But if we abandon militarism and eliminate all war fears in the world, then all pending cases will be easier to resolve, and all countries can discuss political and economic issues, whether international or colonial, in a truly successful atmosphere. Whether it is colonial or other issues, if there are any difficulties, I feel that since all parties have the will to resolve them, they can eventually find a solution. But if the countries do not really want to solve them, then the discussion will do more harm than good. If a responsible spokesperson for a country denounces Britain as a thief and bandit, and spreads words defaming British policy throughout the world every day, how can we negotiate with this government? But if we change this spirit, which is clearly contrary to the will for a peaceful solution, then the British government has never been unprepared to contribute its best advice and adopt the advice of others in order to end the political and economic instability. If we can proceed in this way, then the world will make great progress, and we will be able to restore an atmosphere of mutual trust between countries. After that, the second step will be to rebuild the international order on a broader and more solid foundation. The Foreign Secretary went on to speak of the League of Nations and the Covenant of the League of Nations, saying, "It is an imperfect method to merely prevent the use of force to change the current situation without setting up an agency to promote peaceful change. Today, the countries of Europe are forgetting their common civilization, preparing to kill each other. At this time, we should especially regard Europe as our own, so our foreign policy must always keep the current situation and the future in mind. British policy is based on two points: the determination to resist violence and the recognition of the world's willingness to carry out peaceful work. However, today, the threat of force is making the world restless, so our current task is to resist aggression with all our strength. I dare say that no one can misunderstand us. If we want to dispel all misunderstandings and obtain a solution that the world can trust, then what it is based on must be more practical than verbal responsibilities. There is a saying that what is needed is action, not words. Our view is the same. There must be a practical form of giving and taking on both sides. If you give people real things in exchange for empty promises, then there will never be solid achievements on this basis."</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, the Foreign Secretary spoke of Britain's agreements with Poland, Turkey, Greece, and Romania, and said that negotiations with the Soviet Union would soon be successful. He said, "We assume this obligation with a full understanding of its causes and consequences. We know that if the security and independence of other countries are destroyed, then our own security and independence will also be seriously threatened. We also know that if we want to preserve international law and order, then we must be prepared to fight to defend it. Our country's efforts to build up its military are now being strengthened at any time, and all aspects of political administration and industrial life now have this effort, which has the full support of the people. The confirmation that it is being carried out earnestly is because after the military effort, there is a more united British people, with their service, financial resources, and industrial power."

<p>(Berlin) According to an official statement today, the German government will reply to the British government's memorandum on naval issues to Germany within a considerable period of time. The reply will be made through diplomatic channels. It is almost certain that because the British memorandum is highly technical, it cannot be addressed by Hitler's speech. Today, political circles expressed their opinion, saying that if Hitler speaks in Bremen on Saturday, it will not be of great political significance. British Ambassador to Germany Sir Henderson is scheduled to take a week's leave on Tuesday to return home. Germany's reply may not be ready by then. At the same time, according to political officials, there is deep suspicion between Britain and Germany. Germany cannot now believe in Britain's advocacy of reconciliation. Germany is unwilling to speak until Britain changes its policy. (Reuter's Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to information obtained by Reuters, Hitler is unlikely to go to Bremen tomorrow to attend the launch and ceremony of the new German ship and deliver the speech that everyone expects, as it is believed that he should try to get as much rest as possible before the busy period in the coming autumn, so he will avoid participating in all matters that are not absolutely necessary. According to the German people here, Hitler also realizes that his speech is now valued by the whole world, so he must be extremely cautious about the time and place of publication. It would be difficult for Hitler to deliver a speech at the naval ceremony without mentioning the British naval memorandum. It is said that Hitler is unwilling to anticipate the contents of Germany's formal reply. (Reuter's Dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(London) Greenwell, the acting leader of the Labor Party in the House of Commons, said in a speech in London last night, "I have heard rumors that war will break out sooner or later.

I have never thought that I would use these words, but life is precious, and there is something greater than life: freedom." (Reuter's Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3 id="e29">Halifax's Remarks Are Highly Valued by All Countries; The Most Important Speech Since 1914; German and Italian Newspapers Call It Old Hat <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech has declared to Germany Britain's determination to participate in war at any time to resist aggression. Political figures here expressed their approval after hearing about it. It is reported that the speech had been approved by Prime Minister Chamberlain in advance. Because this afternoon, shocking news was received here about the free city of Danzig, and it was learned that the city's parliament would formally announce its merger into the German territory. If Poland intervenes, Germany will regard it as an act of aggression, and war will begin from this. Foreign Secretary Halifax gave this speech to express Britain's position. His speech was also translated into various languages and broadcast to the world, so that everyone could hear it. Among conservative figures, it is advocated that the government should immediately establish a mutual assistance agreement with the Soviet government to strengthen the anti-aggression front and make all aggressors retreat in the face of difficulties. In addition, the economic talks conducted by the Ministry of Finance with the Polish economic delegation also have the potential to quickly conclude an agreement, allowing Britain to lend a large sum of money to Poland to help it expand its military equipment. (Havas Dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) The British newspapers in London today published British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech in large letters, believing that it represented correct public opinion. The Daily Guide's diplomatic correspondent called the speech "the most serious speech by a British cabinet member since 1914." The Daily Telegraph called Halifax a diplomatic reformer, like Martin Luther of the church. The Daily Express said that Halifax's speech represented the public opinion of the people. (Haitong Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers here today reported that British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech has removed the doubts of the general public about British policy, analyzing that Berlin and Rome should know the valuable results of non-aggression. Polish President Mosicki and German leaders now know that if Poland or Danzig suffers a direct or disguised attack, then this is not a simple local event. The People's Newspaper said that the British Foreign Secretary has expressed a great and beautiful pacifism in respecting the law and international cooperation. We hope that the German people can understand this speech and pay attention to its warning. (Reuter's Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A German government spokesman today criticized British Foreign Secretary Halifax's constant remarks, saying that it would be better if Britain did not repeatedly reiterate its non-aggression and unwillingness to surround Germany. This is because the remarks only make Germany more suspicious. It is childish to think that Britain's constant reiteration of these promises can convince Germany. The German people have a very clear impression of Britain's policy. Germany is not engaged in war preparations, but Britain is giving Poland a blank check and making these preparations. According to the German official opinion, Halifax's speech did not contain new elements. (Reuter's Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German News Agency, which has close ties with the German Foreign Ministry, strongly criticized British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech, saying that most of it was directed at Germany, and was obviously caused by the alarming news about Danzig published in the newspapers of Britain and France. What Berlin is most indignant about is that Halifax still said that Britain is pursuing a policy of peace, but in fact, none of London's recent measures are a manifestation of preparing for war. (Haitong Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After British Foreign Secretary Halifax delivered his speech last night, the newspapers in Berlin attacked it. The Financial Times declared that the propaganda campaign promoted by British cabinet members had two mistakes: (1) They believed that repeating constant remarks with insufficient reasons could strengthen their country's power; (2) They underestimated the common sense and observation ability of foreign people, thinking that they could cover up the eyes and ears of the world. In fact, Halifax's speech was just a repetition of old words. In a word, it still tried to achieve the consistent British policy of balance of power. The German General Bulletin declared that it was a mistake to say that Germany was isolated. Germany was never isolated, and it maintained good land friendship with neutral neighbors. Even the countries that Britain had forced to guarantee them in the dangerous zone recognized Germany's interests related to their survival. (Haitong News Agency Dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) This morning, all newspapers carried excerpts from British Foreign Secretary Halifax's speech, which the Roman People's Newspaper called grand and lacking in constructiveness, saying that his words were spicy and contained threats, but not as diplomatic as the speech delivered by Churchill the day before. It also said that the British people had failed to realize that the wealthy Britain was now in an inevitable decline. (Reuter's Dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) According to the most reliable sources, the Associated Press reporter stated that the Danzig issue is unlikely to worsen in the coming weeks. However, the German side will continue to plan to annex the Free City into Germany. A Paris telegram reported that Germany would deploy troops to seize Danzig at the end of this week, but this is unlikely to materialize. (Associated Press, 30th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Two shocking pieces of news are circulating here: (1) Army officers and most military assistants and soldiers have had their leave cancelled since the end of July; (2) Certain ranks of conscripted soldiers whose service period expires at the end of August will not be discharged but will be required to remain in the camp until the end of September.

<p>Warsaw: According to semi-official news from Danzig today, military supplies and troops have been continuously transported from East Prussia to Danzig in recent days. Yesterday, sixteen artillery pieces were unloaded in a bay east of Danzig and transferred by fishing boats to Bischofsberg. The Danzig authorities are now rushing to build steel-reinforced concrete gun emplacements on the mountain there, with police and stormtroopers guarding the perimeter, prohibiting people from climbing the mountain. The barracks on the mountain have been converted into an armory. It is reported that hundreds of stormtroopers have arrived in Danzig from East Prussia to provide military service to members of the National Socialist Party organization. They are currently living in pre-war underground fortresses. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The German National Socialist Party's organization of volunteer corps in the Free City of Danzig has recently been exposed by various newspapers here. It is reported that yesterday, four artillery pieces were transported by waterway to Danzig and hauled up the Pischkenberg mountain by thirty-two horses, after which anyone was strictly prohibited from climbing the mountain. In addition, the city authorities are employing 3,000 workers to rush the construction of barracks to house the members of the volunteer corps. These members are German youths, aged between nineteen and twenty-three, who have come from the province of East Prussia. The city authorities have also ordered 4,000 sets of uniforms and 4,000 pairs of leather boots from clothing stores and shoe shops within the territory. The required wool and leather are all supplied by the National Socialist Party. The Warsaw Evening News reported that the German side now has two options: one is violent action, and the other is to threaten with war. The latter is more likely, but it is still sufficient to cause a crisis. As for the Danzig authorities, they are also preparing for the mobilization of residents. Among all the phenomena, one point deserves attention: before Germany took action to annex Austria and Czechoslovakia, all preparations were extremely secret; now, in Danzig, there is no attempt to conceal anything. Inferring from this, this is also a strategy, intending to make Poland anxious. (Havas, 30th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Official circles here today vigorously denied that German troops or other personnel have entered Danzig, or that irregular troops are being organized. However, they admitted that Danzig is now strengthening its peaceful forces within legal limits, and only using Danzig citizens. They also said that this is due to the rash and irresponsible behavior of Polish officials in the corridor. An unofficial source in Danzig reported that big events are underway there, and the situation is gradually deteriorating. The rumors of German military deployment are still as usual, and cannot be verified. (Reuters, 30th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Mussolini and Hitler secretly conferred last Sunday. Political circles are now refusing to discuss this matter, and Roman newspapers have not published anything about it. Only a limited number of political figures are aware of this news. Political circles are highly suspicious of this meeting. If it did indeed take place, it must have been initiated by Mussolini, in the hope of advising Hitler not to be too hasty on the Danzig issue. All newspapers here with a peaceful inclination believe that Mussolini will not take straightforward and irreversible steps, thereby plunging Italy into war. This hope has never wavered. Although the general public views Danzig as the main point of contention today, they do not believe that it will threaten the common interests of Italy and Germany, or threaten the security and vital interests of either country. However, after visits between the army, navy, and air force authorities of the two countries, everything must have been agreed upon, so that the army, navy, and air force of the two countries can become a single unit in wartime.

<p>(Washington) The Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Oumansky, paid a special visit to Secretary of State Hull this morning.

According to the Soviet Ambassador, this visit was merely to express goodwill and to say farewell, as the Ambassador will be returning home for a two-month vacation starting next Wednesday. However, the two spoke for as long as fifty minutes, so the nature must be very important. According to external reports, the Soviet Ambassador and Hull not only discussed the recent changes in Europe, but also focused on the Far East issue. It is also said that Oumansky's purpose was to inquire whether the United States' policy towards the East would continue. It is said that Hull replied that if the US and the Soviet Union could cooperate diplomatically, they would be able to stop any acts of aggression. (Associated Press, 30th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) Soviet Supreme Soviet member Zhdanov recently published an article in Pravda, stating that the negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union to conclude a mutual assistance pact have reached a deadlock. Although the Soviet government's position is very clear and it will do its utmost to promote the early signing of a mutual assistance pact, there has been no progress in the negotiations to date. Under the current international situation, this fact is of course extremely important. From this, aggressors and all enemies of peace will devote more effort to undermining the establishment of an anti-aggression agreement among democratic countries and further expand their acts of aggression. This negotiation, which is anticipated by all peace-loving countries and peoples, is now so delayed. What is the reason? I will now express my personal opinion. People have hitherto believed that the British and French governments were truly sincere in establishing a European anti-aggression bulwark when negotiating a mutual assistance pact with the Soviet Union. However, I believe that the British and French governments are actually unwilling to conclude an equal treaty with the Soviet Union, that is, any treaty that a self-respecting country can agree to. This point is precisely the reason for the deadlock in the negotiations. I will try to prove this with facts. What are the facts? First of all, the so-called British-Soviet negotiations, in the proper sense, have been underway for seventy-five days from the time we received the first British proposal on April 15 to the present. During this period, the Soviet government spent only sixteen days preparing replies to the British proposals and suggestions, while the British and French governments spent fifty-nine days on delays and discussions. Does this fact not prove that the responsibility for the slowness of the negotiations should be borne by the British and French sides? Furthermore, past experience in concluding international agreements similar to those currently being negotiated by Britain, France, and the Soviet Union proves that Britain only needed a very short period to establish mutual assistance agreements with Turkey and Poland. This proves that if there is a genuine desire to sign a treaty, Britain can proceed with the necessary speed. The British and French governments' extremely tolerant delays and endless discussions during the negotiations with the Soviet Union are sufficient to make us suspect the true intentions of Britain and France, and force us to raise the following question: what is the basis of this policy? Is it truly intended to safeguard the peace front, or is it merely to use the negotiations and the delay of the negotiations to achieve other goals that have nothing in common with the establishment of a front of peace-loving countries? The British and French governments have repeatedly raised various artificial difficulties in the negotiations. Among the issues that Britain and France could have quickly resolved if they were sincere, it seems that there are serious differences of opinion between Britain and France and the Soviet Union. This fact further deepens the above question. For example, the joint guarantee by the three parties that Latvia, Estonia, and Finland would receive immediate assistance if their neutrality was violated by aggressors is one of the artificial "obstacles" in the negotiations. It is claimed that the aforementioned Baltic countries are unwilling to accept this guarantee, and this is the reason why Britain and France cannot accept the Soviet proposal. In fact, this is clearly not a problem, and it is only brought up for the sole purpose of hindering the progress of the negotiations and thereby undermining them. In short, the facts we know are sufficient to prove that when Britain believes that safeguarding a certain country is in its own interests, it can find normal methods to achieve its goal without waiting for the country to ask for protection. For example, the British Sunday Times reported on June 4 this year: "Poland has agreed that when Britain is drawn into war due to the invasion of Holland, it will send troops to help Britain, and Britain has agreed that when Poland is drawn into war due to the invasion of Danzig or Lithuania, it will also provide Poland with assistance." In this way, Poland and Britain have simultaneously given guarantees to Lithuania and Holland. I do not know whether the opinions of Lithuania and Holland have been consulted regarding this double guarantee, but the newspapers have never carried this news. Furthermore, as far as I know, Holland and Lithuania have both denied the existence of such a guarantee. However, the Sunday Times claimed that the treaty guaranteeing the two countries has been signed, and this news has not been denied by any party. Not long ago, Polish Foreign Minister Beck, in a conversation with a French reporter, stated definitively, among other things, that Poland does not request or solicit any guarantee from the Soviet Union and is completely satisfied with this fact. The above points prove that although Britain and France constantly swear to uphold "equality," they are actually unwilling to sign a treaty with the Soviet Union based on the principle of equality and reciprocity. What they want is a treaty in which the Soviet Union alone bears all the obligations. Of course, any self-respecting country that does not want to "pull chestnuts out of the fire for others" cannot agree to this kind of treaty, and the Soviet Union, whose reputation is already known throughout the world, cannot agree to it either. In my view, Britain and France seem to have no intention of signing an acceptable treaty with the Soviet Union, and are only talking about the so-called treaty in order to speculate on the exaggerated attitude of the Soviet Union in their own domestic public opinion. To be frank, the developments of recent days will be able to prove whether this is true. (TASS, 29th)</p>
<h3 id="e34">Guangdong Military Authorities Establish Guerrilla Zone Command Post: Unifying Command, Dispatch, and Other Powers and Responsibilities; Significant Results Achieved Since the Launch of Guerrilla Warfare <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Shaoguan Correspondence: The strength of the Guangdong Province guerrilla forces is growing daily. The ×th War Zone Command Headquarters is consolidating guerrilla forces in various places to promote the power of guerrilla warfare. For those guerrillas with a shallow understanding of politics, special improvements are being made. The specific measures are: (A) Current guerrilla members will be given a qualitative screening, the names and command powers of the guerrilla forces will be strictly defined, and any self-organized combinations will be banned to avoid disturbing the people and affecting their faith in the country and the spirit of cooperation between the military and the people. (B) Each district guerrilla command headquarters will immediately establish cadre training classes to strictly implement training in order to cultivate good cadres and assign them to various departments to undertake basic work, so as to instill political understanding in each member. In the future, newly recruited members must undergo strict training to enrich their national and ethnic ideology in order to strengthen their will. The ×th War Zone Command Headquarters, together with the headquarters of the ×× Group Army, has compiled "The Essentials of Guerrilla Warfare" and distributed it to each district guerrilla command headquarters for compliance, striving to exert the most effective strategy to realize the purpose and mission of guerrilla warfare. After this reorganization, the guerrilla forces in each department are more determined, and the strategy and tactics in combat have become more flexible. Regarding the powers and responsibilities of unified command and dispatch of guerrilla forces, the ×th War Zone Command Headquarters has recently established a guerrilla zone command post, and Xiang Hanping, Deputy Commander of the ×× Group Army, has been appointed as the director of the post. After receiving the order, Xiang went to inspect Huizhou, Yangbo, Dongguan, Baoan, and other counties in eastern Guangdong, inspected the local situation, and established the post in a certain place in eastern Guangdong to command the guerrilla forces in all parts of the province. The organization of the post, under the director, is divided into staff, adjutant, secretary, and manager, as well as a training and political office. The chiefs of each department were also appointed at the same time. Zhang Wen is the chief of staff, Lin Zhuliang is the adjutant, Deng Tan is the secretary, and Wang Xianting is the manager. The director of the political training office is being selected by the Military Affairs Commission. In addition, Xiong Lue was hired as a senior advisor. The guerrilla commanders of each war zone of the ×th War Zone have also been reappointed. The commander of the first district is Lu Ling, whose jurisdiction covers Nanhai, Sanshui, and Huaxian. The second district is Wu Guanqi, whose jurisdiction covers Panyu, Conghua, Zengcheng, and other counties. The third district is Luo Fengxiang, whose jurisdiction covers Huiyang, Boluo, Zijin, Heyuan, and other counties. The fourth district is Wang Ruozhou, whose jurisdiction covers Dongguan, Baoan, and other counties. The fifth district is Ma Shaoping, whose jurisdiction covers Xinhui, Kaiping, Heshan, Chixi, Enping, Taishan, and other counties. The sixth district is Wu Fei, whose jurisdiction covers Zhongshan County. Since the launch of large-scale guerrilla warfare, the guerrilla forces have achieved great results. The guerrilla war records of each county are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Nanhai</p>
<p>The Nanhai and Sanshui area guerrilla forces, at about 8:00 p.m. on the 6th, sneaked to the section between Shizishan and Xiaotang, secretly dug up fifteen pairs of Guangsan Railway tracks, and disguised wooden tracks on the roadbed to conceal the Japanese military's movements. On the morning of the 7th, a train carrying military supplies to supply the Japanese army in Sanshui drove eastward from the southwest and returned to Foshan, carrying a small team of thirty people. At 7:00 a.m., it drove to the wooden track section between Xiaotang and Shizishan. Unable to withstand the pressure, it crashed loudly, and the train derailed and overturned. The Japanese soldiers in the carriage could not escape and were crushed to death. At about 8:00 a.m., the Japanese soldiers in Foshan heard the news and sent more than thirty engineers in a car to Xiaotang to rescue and transport the wounded and killed Japanese soldiers back to Foshan for treatment. They also vented their anger on the villagers. On the same day, they sent more than a hundred Japanese soldiers to Shishan, claiming that the villagers had destroyed the tracks. They ignored everything and opened fire on anyone they saw, and set fire to more than twenty civilian houses in the village before retreating at 2:00 p.m.</p>
<p>Panyu</p>
<p>The guerrilla forces in Panyu County constantly launch surprise attacks on the Japanese army. The Japanese army constantly uses the Shixin Road (from Shiqiao to Xinzhao) and Xinshi Road (from Xinzhao to Shilou) highways for military transport. The guerrilla forces have been constantly sabotaging these roads in the past week. The Japanese army repairs and sabotages them repeatedly, making it impossible to maintain them, and is extremely angry. From the 12th, they specially sent more than a hundred Japanese soldiers to patrol and guard the two roads all day long. However, the guerrilla forces appear and disappear frequently, and the Japanese army cannot stop them. On the 15th, they burned down the Xinzhao Road railway station and killed two Japanese special police officers. Also, at noon on the 12th, a Japanese wooden boat was searching for a large amount of food in various villages and was sailing through Dongpu. The guerrilla forces of Li Datong's unit detected it, disguised as fishermen, driving five small boats on the sea, fishing. Several earth cannons were ambushed on the shore. When the Japanese boat arrived, they suddenly jumped onto the Japanese boat, first killing fifteen Japanese soldiers, and then capturing the boat and driving it to a certain place, where all the rice and grain were unloaded. At about 3:00 a.m., the Japanese side realized it and sent five electric boats to search, but the guerrilla forces had already safely withdrawn. It was not until that evening that the Japanese soldiers, seeing no clues, left in frustration. In addition, the Japanese army is extremely fearful because the guerrilla forces launch surprise attacks from time to time. Recently, they forced the Panyu puppet county government to be responsible for suppressing them. After receiving the order, the puppet county government forcibly pulled people from various villages to organize so-called commando teams. However, most of the people are very aware of the righteousness and are unwilling to be used by the Japanese side. Therefore, the county magistrate sent the puppet security chief on the 9th to lure the village chiefs of the Shitou and Xixu villages to conscript strong men. The villagers of Shitou Village, Chen Jian and Gao Laochao, were outraged and shot the chief to death on the way. The two Japanese soldiers who were protecting him were also killed. The people were very happy.</p>

<p>At about 10:00 a.m. on the 10th, Peng, the chairman of the puppet maintenance association of Rongqi Wufang, was drinking tea and reading the newspaper at the Yichang Tea House on the upper street market. He was shot dead by the guerrilla forces on the way home, and Peng's head was chopped off, placed in a bamboo basket, and taken back to the guerrilla headquarters to receive a reward. Afterwards, Peng's henchmen ran to report to the Japanese army in Rongqi. The Japanese army commander, Harada, arrived at the scene to inspect and blamed Peng's accomplices, saying, "Why didn't you resist? You are useless." He laughed and left. Since this incident, the Rongqi puppets have been living in fear all day long.</p>
<p>Dongguan</p>
<p>The Ye Tieliang unit guerrilla force, which is active on the Wanzhang Highway (Luozhen to Zhangmutou), attacked the puppet maintenance association in front of the Wancheng County Government on the night of the 10th. More than a hundred members of the team first broke through the main gate of the county government at about 11:00 p.m. At that time, the puppet self-defense team was suddenly attacked and urgently telegraphed the Japanese army headquarters at Mingsheng Middle School for assistance. However, the guerrilla members had been prepared and had surrounded the Japanese camp beforehand. When the Japanese army rushed in, they blocked the key points and prevented them from advancing and attacking a part of the puppet maintenance association, so they were able to proceed smoothly, rushing into the association and killing more than twenty puppet self-defense team members and puppet maintenance association officials. They also found important documents on the bodies of the two puppets, Li and Chen, and seized the puppet self-defense team leader's short and long guns and remaining poles. Also, Lun, a wealthy merchant in Shilong Town, was very successful in distributing medicines for an agency Western pharmacy. When the Japanese planes bombed Sanshilong last year, he had moved his family to Hong Kong. Later, he returned from Hong Kong. At that time, the Japanese army lured various offices in Shilong to organize a puppet autonomous maintenance association and instructed the association to elect Lun as the puppet chairman. However, Lun excused himself, saying that he had private affairs in Hong Kong and needed to clear them up before returning to Shilong to take up the puppet position. The Japanese army approved this. This matter was detected by the guerrilla force, so they sent a team to lie in ambush on the way. When Lun was traveling from Shilong to Hong Kong and arrived at Pinghu Station on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway, they suddenly arrested Lun and found a lot of Hong Kong dollars on his body. He was taken to the Huizhou headquarters. During the court hearing, Lun requested that the matter be investigated and handled. It is said that the headquarters has executed Lun by firing squad.</p>

<p>Suzhou Correspondence: On the 23rd, dozens of soldiers from the Japanese army's Guangye unit suddenly entered the city in armed formation, together with more than a hundred puppet police officers, and guarded key traffic arteries. They forcibly seized pedestrians, regardless of class. At that time, the people were in great panic and fled in droves. The shops were also closed and the market was suspended, and the order was greatly disrupted for a time. Finally, because there were many Japanese puppets, the three thousand plus abducted were forced to load on trains that night by a Japanese unit and sent to Wuxi to await transfer work. After this incident, the residents of Suzhou were panicked. The pedestrians on the road during the day were sparse. Some shops could not open because their staff were seized, and there was a sense of storm all over the city. According to the news released by the puppet police station recently, the Japanese army needed to conscript a large number of people to assist in the battle because of the war in the Yixing area. Similar incidents also occurred in other counties.</p>

<p>Taicang Correspondence: On the night of the 19th, Zong Boliang, the commander of a certain independent regiment of the Chinese army guerrilla force, led squadron leader Wu Jianping and more than sixty members to attack the Japanese and puppet troops stationed in Huangjing Town, Taicang. First, he used fifteen daredevils disguised as villagers to hide box guns, penetrating into the Japanese and puppet camp, capturing the guarding puppet troops, cutting off the military telephone line set up inside, and destroying its defensive works. Then, he used members to ambush all around for external attacks, rushing straight into the camp. At that time, the Japanese and puppet troops were in sweet dreams, and upon hearing the alarm, they responded in a panic, with gunshots gathering for a time. The Japanese and puppet troops immediately suffered more than forty casualties. The team leader then led the team to rush and kill across the bridge, and the Japanese and puppet troops withdrew from the camp, retreating to Jiuqu Township. The team captured a Japanese Lieutenant Sugi and seven puppet troops alive, as well as a large number of military supplies, including twenty-four Type 38 rifles, forty-three boxes of ammunition, and one machine gun.

<h3 id="e38">Semiannual Settlement of Silver and Banking Businesses: All Expected to Obtain Considerable Profits; Financial Market Stable and All Businesses Passing Through Peacefully; Banking Business Association Convenes Meeting to Publicly Decide Interbank Lending Rate <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the end of June, the semiannual settlement period for silver and banking businesses. The financial market remained stable, and all businesses passed through peacefully. Today will be the start of a three-day holiday, with business operations resuming on the 4th. The Banking Business Association convened a meeting and publicly decided on the interbank lending rate. All firms are expected to obtain considerable profits. Detailed information is recorded below:</p>
<p>Semiannual Settlement Announcement by Silver and Banking Businesses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association and the Silver Business Association jointly announced yesterday: "It is hereby announced that the banking and money businesses' semiannual settlement holiday falls on July 1st and 2nd. However, since the 2nd is a regular Sunday holiday, in accordance with regulations, an additional day should be added the following day. Therefore, all banks and money businesses under these two associations will be closed for three days, from July 1st, 2nd, and 3rd. This announcement is made for public awareness." All banks and firms are permitted to resume business operations starting July 4th. However, although outwardly closed from July 1st to 3rd, internally, depending on the business of each bank and firm, normal office work will continue to process semiannual settlement matters.</p>
<p>Regular Meeting of Silver Business Association Members</p>
<p>The Silver Business Association held its 45th regular meeting of member representatives of the third session on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 2 PM. Representatives from over forty firms, including Fuyuan, Shunkang, Baofeng, Tongrun, and Yida, such as Lu Shuchen, Shen Jingliang, Yan Dayou, and Zhang Wenbo, attended. Zhang Yezhou chaired the meeting, with Secretary Ge Huaiqing taking minutes. They resolved that the interbank lending rate for June would be 5 yuan and 5 jiao. In addition, five measures, including interest rates for receiving and remitting funds, and methods for exchanging centralized check clearing into legal tender, were discussed.</p>
<p>Silver Businesses Pass Resolution to Handle Settlement</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned that silver businesses typically handle settlement at the end of the lunar year. Their long-term credit loans are due at the end of April and October. Therefore, whenever banks handle their semiannual settlement, silver businesses continue to operate as usual. The Silver Business Joint Reserve also operates as usual. Consequently, the Silver Business Association's holiday schedule does not include holiday provisions. However, this year, after approval by the association, they will jointly handle the semiannual settlement with the banking industry. Therefore, a joint announcement has been issued with the Banking Association to handle the semiannual settlement.</p>
<p>Financial Market Remains Stable</p>
<p>Although yesterday was the end of June, the day for silver and banking businesses to handle settlements, the Shanghai financial market, since the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram restricting withdrawals, has remained as stable as ever. The interbank lending rate in the silver market, on the contrary, has decreased from 1 jiao 2 fen to 2 jiao. The various discount rates of the Four Banks Discount Meeting and the Bank Reserve have not changed. However, the check clearing house, to facilitate check collection and settlement for its members, has specifically extended the check clearing time, stipulating that it will begin at 4:45 PM. As for the time for collecting checks, it remains the same as before.</p>
<p>Bank Profits, All Businesses Pass Through Peacefully</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to inquiries made by reporters from the New Voice to various industries, various businesses within the Shanghai Concession have experienced abnormal growth due to increased population and surging demand after the war. All had surpluses during this Dragon Boat Festival settlement. Therefore, loans from various banks due at the end of June were all recovered as scheduled. As a result of the semiannual settlement, they were able to obtain considerable profits. No unfortunate events occurred in the market. The situation was better than before the war, and all industries reported peacefully passing through. This is truly due to the government's and banks' regulatory efforts.</p>

<p>Mail from Shanghai to Eastern Zhejiang and various cities and counties along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line is a concern for Zhejiang residents in Shanghai due to the interruption of shipping between Shanghai and Zhejiang. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the New Voice News Agency yesterday to the Transportation Division of the Shanghai Postal Administration, regarding Eastern Zhejiang mail, in addition to the temporary suspension of accepting parcels and heavy items, ordinary, registered, and express mail is now being routed through Jinjiang, Fujian. Therefore, mail delivery between Shanghai and Zhejiang will not be delayed as a result of this. However, the time will be slightly longer. Remittances are still processed normally, and remittances can be made without restrictions. Regarding insured mail to various locations in the Fujian postal area, the Postal Administration has decided to temporarily suspend accepting it starting today due to recent bombings and instability in Fujian. However, Xiamen is an exception and can still accept insured mail as usual. A formal announcement will be issued to inform the public. It was also learned that since the resumption of postal services in Jiujiang, the Jiujiang First-Class Post Office's Shanghai office would have some key personnel leave Shanghai for Jiujiang. Now, due to the development of postal affairs in Jiujiang, the postal staff is unable to cope. Therefore, the Shanghai office will be closed, and over twenty postal workers will be recalled to Jiujiang to take on important tasks.</p>

<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports that the U.S. Navy transport ship USS Henderson is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at noon on Sunday, carrying replacement troops. Two detachments of the U.S. 4th Marine Regiment stationed in Shanghai will depart on the ship on Monday morning at 11:00 AM, bound for Qinhuangdao for summer training. After these two detachments leave Shanghai, the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai will have only about 500 personnel remaining. However, the two detachments of the U.S. Marine Corps that went to Qinhuangdao last month aboard the USS Chaumont will return to Shanghai on the USS Henderson. It is expected that the ship will dock for ten days upon its second arrival in Shanghai before carrying Marine Corps and Navy personnel whose Far East service has expired back to the United States.</p>

<p>Mr. Stirling Fessenden, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, retired at the end of June this year upon completion of his term. During the Council meeting on June 28th, Chairman Mr. Fessenden addressed the Council, stating roughly that today was the last meeting of the Council members and Secretary-General Fessenden. The Vice-Chairman of the Council had previously expressed the regret of all Council members at a farewell banquet. He now wished to reiterate to Mr. Fessenden that the Council deeply appreciated his service. Mr. Fessenden had served as Secretary-General since 1927, during which time his contributions were remarkable. The residents of this city universally respected him. Mr. Fessenden's retirement was undoubtedly a loss to the Council. However, on a personal level, it was a gain, as Mr. Fessenden would be cooperating with him in the practice of law, etc. The Council members unanimously applauded in farewell.</p>
<p>The English-language "Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury" reports that Mr. Stirling Fessenden, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, left his office for the last time as an employee of the Council this afternoon (the 30th), marking the end of many years of service. But his advice is still available. When interviewed by reporters this morning, Mr. Fessenden stated that he had no different feelings and nothing special to report. He also mentioned that he had no intention of leaving Shanghai but wished to rest. In a few months, he may travel to the Pacific coast of the United States. It is noted that Mr. Fessenden is not retiring but will return to practicing law.</p>
<h3 id="e42">Interbank Clearing System Scheduled to Begin on the 4th; Transfers to the Interior Immediately Payable in Cash; Ministry of Finance Has Telegraphed Approval to Proceed <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance's Ma telegram implementing restrictions on withdrawals, due to its nature aimed at cracking down on those speculating in foreign exchange in Shanghai, the banking and silver industries have, based on the Ma telegram, negotiated seven measures to vigorously safeguard legitimate commerce while suppressing foreign exchange speculation. A reporter from this newspaper learned from financial circles that the banking and silver associations have telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to report the agreed-upon seven measures and the negotiated interbank clearing system. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has recently telegraphed a reply, stating that regarding the adjustment of legal tender funds, the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications have been instructed to handle it as appropriate. The other points have also been approved. As for the issue of clearing surcharges, which everyone is concerned about, according to news from the Banking Association, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee has negotiated to exchange the original clearing deposits for legal tender in installments. Therefore, after July 4th, clearing surcharges will naturally tend to disappear. At the same time, the new interbank clearing system will be implemented, hoping to provide foreign banks with reliable connections for these clearing notes. From now on, industrial and commercial enterprises can use this clearing system to transfer funds to various banks for the purchase of raw materials in the interior, and interior banks will pay in cash. According to financial circles, this measure has been approved by the Ministry of Finance and has been relayed to various banks for implementation. Therefore, the issue of remittances to the interior for purchasing goods, which the market has been concerned about recently, has been properly resolved. Yesterday, financial circles also relayed that the Ministry of Finance would make a statement on the clearing portion at the beginning of the month. This statement could not be confirmed by reporters last night when inquiring with authoritative sources in the banking industry. It was said that, as of now, nothing had been heard. It is expected that the Ministry of Finance has now approved and filed the various measures recently formulated by the Shanghai silver and banking industries after restricting withdrawals. Now that Shanghai's finance is stable, the measures to stabilize finance have come to an end.</p>
<p>Withdrawal Registration</p>
<p>The Bank Joint Reserve Committee is handling interbank withdrawals and clearings, with the total amount provisionally set at 50 million national currency. It is scheduled to be implemented starting July 4th after handling withdrawals and clearings. All banks and firms can provide property as collateral to withdraw funds from the committee. After the committee assesses the value of the property provided by each bank and firm, it will be included in the clearing current account and a checkbook will be issued for withdrawals. The checks issued from this checkbook will be paid by the Bank Reserve. This check is the interbank clearing. Anyone holding this interbank clearing can exchange it for a clearing certificate from the Bank Reserve.</p>
<p>Foreign Merchants Agree</p>
<p>Regarding foreign banks accepting clearing notes, after consultations between the Banking Association and the Foreign Banks Association, the foreign banks have expressed their agreement in principle with the interbank clearing system and have agreed that interbank clearings can be used as collateral for overdrafts. The specific measures are still being negotiated, and they have agreed to send representatives to participate in the Shanghai Banking and Silver Industry Interbank Clearing Reserve Inspection Committee. Therefore, after the clearing note system is improved, it can be widely circulated in the market. Therefore, its circulation effect is no different from cash, which is sufficient to supply the capital needs of the city's industry and commerce.</p>
<p>Establish Assessment Committee</p>
<p>In order to assess the value of the collateral provided by each bank and firm for the interbank clearing, the Bank Reserve Committee has decided to hire experts to form an assessment committee, divided into: Real Estate Section, Securities and Stock Section, and Goods Section. Each section will have a chairman and several executive members. An Interbank Clearing Reserve Inspection Committee will also be established, with five members. It will be announced after each group nominates members. It will then be established. It will then hold at least one inspection per month and announce the amount withdrawn and the types and amounts of collateral separately.</p>
<p>Transfer to the Interior</p>
<p>Interbank clearings can be transferred to the interior for purchasing local goods. This is stipulated in Article 12 of the Bank Joint Reserve Committee's Interbank Withdrawal Method. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the New Voice News Agency to the banking industry, all factories and firms in Shanghai that need local raw materials and want to purchase them in the interior previously required cash. From now on, they can use this clearing to transfer funds to banks in the interior, which is completely the same as legal tender. Therefore, in the future, those holding clearings will no longer need to apply for discounts from small money shops, so clearing surcharges are certain to disappear automatically. If they cannot be completely eliminated, they will definitely not be as rampant as in the past.</p>
<p>Exchange for Legal Tender</p>
<p>In order to centralize the original clearing deposits of various banks and firms in the Bank Reserve Committee and the Silver Business Reserve, it has been decided to exchange them for legal tender at 95 percent over twelve weeks after the semiannual settlement. The legal tender will be provided by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank. Therefore, in the future, in addition to increasing the number of new clearing funds with reliable collateral, the market will also increase the number of legal tender funds by 20 million yuan. At the same time, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee will announce the interest rate of interbank clearing and the interest rate of clearing deposits daily. As for the widespread circulation of clearing notes, clearing surcharges may disappear automatically.</p>

<p>Due to the Japanese Navy's attempted landings in recent days, the situation along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian has suddenly become tense. The gap in the Zhenhai blockade line, after the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters Commander-in-Chief General Liu telegraphed to sink the old Taiping wheel on the evening of the 28th to formally block it, the German merchant ship Moufu wheel, which was sailing to Ningbo, was unable to enter the port and temporarily anchored outside the blockade line. According to inquiries made by a reporter from the Daguan News Agency to the Lihe Foreign Firm, the ship was still anchored outside the port yesterday and will discharge passengers and goods into the port there before returning directly to Shanghai. As for whether the Taiping wheel had actually sunk, no telegrams had been received as of 7:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<p>Preparing to Blockade the Coast of Zhejiang and Fujian</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency has learned from the shipping industry that since the Japanese army forcibly occupied the Zhoushan Islands and attempted to land in Kanmen, Yuhuan County, Zhejiang, and Chuanshi Island, Fuzhou, Fujian, the situation along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian has become tense. The military authorities of Zhejiang and Fujian have ordered the garrisons to be on strict alert in order to strengthen coastal defenses. In addition to blocking the gap in the Zhenhai blockade line in Ningbo, the gaps in the Oujiang River in Wenzhou and the Mawei blockade line in Fuzhou will be blocked if necessary.</p>
<p>Concentration of Japanese Warships, Intentions Unclear</p>
<p>Three Japanese warships are cruising outside the mouth of the Oujiang River in Wenzhou, and there have been no unusual movements. Japanese warships frequently come and go off the coast of Yueqing. In addition to passing through without stopping, there are currently nine Japanese warships anchored. Near Yanpan and Wengyang, there are also more than ten small motorboats and more than twenty captured civilian ships, seemingly with the intention of landing. Off Guanyin Mountain in Yuhuan, there is one Japanese-type warship anchored. In the waters off Chawu and Shengbei, there are more than ten Japanese warships of various sizes, with unclear intentions. Off Chuanshi in Fujian, there are currently three Japanese warships anchored, with unclear intentions.</p>
<p>Reports of Shelling at Zhenhai Inaccurate</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, it was widely rumored in the city that fierce shelling had occurred outside Zhenhai, and that the news had been telegraphed to Shanghai by the Moufu wheel. However, according to inquiries made by reporters to the Lihe Foreign Firm, the firm stated that it had not received any telegrams of shelling, so it considered the news to be inaccurate. Reporters inquired with the Zhongyi Company and was also informed that no reports had been received. However, Ningbo was learned to be peaceful, so the rumors were clearly not true.</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Bombing Fuzhou and Wenzhou</p>
<p>According to telegrams received by the shipping industry: Three Japanese aircraft invaded and bombed Wenzhou at around 9:00 AM on the 29th, and dropped five or six bombs in Yueqing, with unknown losses. Six Japanese aircraft invaded and dropped bombs in Fuzhou at around 7:00 AM on the 29th, and bombed Changmen and Mawei, with minor losses. However, the above news has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>Chinese Troops Counterattack Ships in Wenzhou</p>
<p>After the Japanese army landed in Yuhuan off the coast of Wenzhou, a large number of fresh Chinese troops arrived and launched a counterattack. Currently, six Japanese warships are anchored off Yuhuan, with continued intentions. According to telegrams received by the shipping industry yesterday afternoon, three Japanese warships shelled the shore from Huanghuaguan off the coast of Wenzhou on the morning of the 30th, firing more than thirty rounds. The Chinese defense forces also returned fire.</p>
<p>Japanese Army Fails to Land at Chuanshan</p>
<p>After the Japanese army landed on Dinghai Island in the Zhoushan Islands, they have remained there and have not left. Although Chuanshan, which is separated from Dinghai by a body of water, is threatened, the military authorities of Zhejiang Province have stepped up security. According to reports received in Shanghai, two Japanese warships shelled Chuanshan on the morning of the 29th and launched six motorboats filled with Japanese troops, attempting to land under the cover of artillery fire. They were met with a head-on counterattack by the defense forces and failed to succeed.</p>
<p>Kangshu Arrives at Songjiang, Shenhua Oujiang</p>
<p>After the Wenzhou-Taizhou Garrison Commander forbade all ships from sailing to Wenzhou, preparations were also made to block the gap in the Oujiang blockade line. The Zhongyi Company's Kangsha Yilun, the last ship to leave Wenzhou for Shanghai, arrived at the mouth of the Wusong River at 12:00 PM yesterday. Because there were no vacancies at the Huangpu River Customs pontoons, it had to temporarily anchor at the mouth of the Songjiang River and is scheduled to sail into the Huangpu River again this morning. In addition, the British Yilong Company's Shenhua wheel, which loaded cargo in Shanghai and sailed to Wenzhou this time, telegraphed Shanghai yesterday, reporting that it had arrived outside the mouth of the Oujiang River and would sail into Wenzhou after being approved by the Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>Shenfu Sails to Shanghai, Shenguang Leaves Chuanshi</p>
<p>The British Yilong Company's Shenfu telegraphed Shanghai, reporting that it had loaded cargo and more than 70 refugees from Chuanshi, Fujian, the day before yesterday and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 7:00 AM this morning, docking at pontoons 26 and 27. Also, the Shenguang wheel telegraphed Shanghai last night, reporting that two-thirds of the ship's cargo had been unloaded. Today, due to the tense situation, unloading has been temporarily suspended. It was ordered to temporarily leave the Chuanshi pier and anchor in the waters near Chuanshi. The Mawei blockade is heavily guarded, which has caused obstacles to barge transportation.</p>
<p>Fujian-Zhejiang Shipping Lines Temporarily Interrupted</p>
<p>Since the situation along the coast of Zhejiang and Fujian has become tense and Zhenhai has announced a blockade, all ships sailing on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, such as Feikang, Haifu, Baoli, Hana, Ende, and Kangsha Yi, and the Shanghai-Ningbo line, such as Moufu and Deping, have all been suspended. As for Swire's Xinbeijing Lun, it has changed its route to Xiudu in Fuzhou. Xiliangzhou, Yingzhou, Luzhou, and Jinan have changed their route to Hong Kong. Currently, the Shanghai-Ningbo-Wenzhou line is almost completely suspended, and transportation is interrupted.</p>

<p>North Jiangsu's Chongming Island's Beihai Gate, Qidong's Xingang, Lingdian Port, and Sanhe Port, which belong to the two counties, have experienced battles since the 24th of this month. Japanese warships and aircraft have indiscriminately bombed them, and this is still continuing as of yesterday. Jardine Matheson's Yihe Lun sailed to Northern Jiangsu on the day before yesterday, escorted by a British warship, because of</p>
<p>Grim Situation</p>
<p>Without docking in Xingang Lingdian Port, it sailed straight to Sanhe Port and docked that night. After unloading passengers and goods, it was fully loaded with passengers and goods at 2:30 PM yesterday and sailed back to Shanghai, docking at the Bund Garden Pier. It is scheduled to set sail for Northern Jiangsu again at 7:00 AM this morning. At the same time, the German Haibi Company's Lisha Lun has also joined the voyage. The terminal is said to be Qinglong Port. The German shipping companies all received a notification from the German consulate yesterday, stating that they had been</p>
<p>Notified by Japanese Authorities</p>
<p>That there are military operations in the ports of the Northern Jiangsu shipping lines, which have been blockaded. All ships must only sail up to Qinglong Port as their terminal. If they do not follow the above methods, the Japanese side will not be responsible for any dangerous events that occur to the ships. The German shipping companies, considering this matter to be related to the future of the company's business, once convened a meeting and collectively decided to request the German consulate to</p>
<p>Raise an Objection</p>
<p>To the Japanese side to restore the shipping lines of the ports on the Northern Jiangsu line in order to maintain the interests of shipping merchants. They also decided that if it were absolutely necessary, all ships would change to sailing at night, operating back and forth on shifts in order to save expenses and maintain business.</p>

<p>Shanghai citizens' food problems have been greatly affected by the speculation of speculators, which has caused market prices to fluctuate unpredictably. After the authorities set a maximum price limit of 21 yuan for high-quality rice, the city's food supply was able to safely pass. The rising trend in the market has been eliminated, and hoarders have also sold off in large quantities. The available funds in the market have suddenly increased, showing a trend of supply exceeding demand. Rice prices have gradually declined. The Shanghai rice mills still have 436,427 bags of rice in storage. Together with the spot goods in the rice shops' sales departments and the rice accumulated by citizens, the rice industry estimates that</p>
<p>The Total Rice in Shanghai</p>
<p>Is around one million bags, so the market's confidence is becoming more stable. Also, 3,000 tons of Saigon rice have been traded, and the source of rice from various countries is continuous. More than 4,000 to 5,000 bags are shipped to Shanghai every day. This number can slightly offset the daily consumption. It is heard that the Shanghai Municipal Council will further lower rice prices to benefit the citizens. Yesterday, the rice market became active again due to the hoarders, purchasing more than 4,000 bags. The purchases from each road were smooth, and each item</p>

<h3 id="e48">Shanghai Still Hopes for the Issuance of Small Denomination Notes; Stamps Are Too Light and Small, and Users Often Lose Them <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>The copper coin shortage and panic in this city were quite serious when the trend first occurred last month. However, the difficulty was gradually removed by the use of stamps as a substitute by various sectors. After the tram and public transport companies of the two concessions issued temporary token notes, the situation became even more eased. Now, it is rare to see various merchants issuing their own substitute notes. Even if they do issue them, they are limited to their own business scope. As for the various merchants' groups' plan to issue joint substitute notes to remedy the difficulties in transactions, they have all voluntarily abandoned it. However, the use of stamps as small denominations is still practiced in the market. Because they are too light and small, users often lose them, and it is easy to damage them in the process of handover, which often leads to disputes. Various industries, especially small businesses, still hope that the Ministry of Finance will issue small denomination notes to transport to Shanghai to remedy the situation. It is generally believed that the use of stamps on the market is permissible as a temporary transition. However, over time, difficulties will inevitably arise, which will affect merchants' business.</p>

<p>According to the "North-China Daily News," Mrs. Renshaw, a British woman residing at No. 79 Suzhou Road, narrowly escaped harm yesterday (the 29th) at nearly 8 PM. About fifteen Japanese soldiers were chasing guerrillas along the fields beside Avenue Haig, reaching the vicinity of the intersection of Zhongshan Road. They used Mrs. Renshaw's car as cover to fire at an unidentified target from behind. A reporter interviewed Mrs. Renshaw last night. She stated that the Japanese soldiers sped across the road, firing as they went. They first ordered her to stop, but upon seeing she was a foreigner, they desisted. Not wanting to be involved in any disturbances, she quickly drove to Great Western Road. While she was there, there were twenty gunshots. Although other parts of the car were not hit, both rear tires were punctured by Japanese bullets. At the time, another foreigner was driving from the opposite direction. He slowed down first, but upon seeing what was happening, he sped away. The reporter asked Mrs. Renshaw if she saw anyone shooting at the Japanese soldiers. She replied that she did not. She only intended to drive forward as quickly as possible and enter the British military zone, then stopped by the roadside to report to a British officer on duty there. It was said that Mrs. Renshaw's car was still parked there late last night, with the left rear tire severely damaged. Both tires were punctured and further damaged due to the hasty escape from the gunfire. Yesterday morning and between 8 and 9 PM last night, British troops in the area heard rifle and machine-gun fire from Hongqiao. To prevent unforeseen events, they parked a British military truck equipped with a searchlight behind the British sentry post by the roadside. According to several residents in the western district, they heard intense machine-gun fire mixed with rifle fire every few minutes between 8 and 9:15 PM. Just after 9 PM, they also heard artillery fire. The reporter drove through the area around 10 PM last night and found it completely quiet. From the looks of it, nothing abnormal seemed to have happened.</p>

<p>At 3:30 AM yesterday morning, a junior officer of the British Defense Force's East Surrey Regiment, A.J. Hughes, dressed in plain clothes, was walking near the Ewo Bakery factory at No. 1423 Yu Yuan Road in Western Shanghai. Suddenly, several robbers jumped out from the side of the road, drew their pistols, and blocked his path, robbing Hughes of more than 60 yuan in cash he was carrying. They also shot and wounded him in the arm before fleeing. Afterward, Hughes reported the incident to the British military authorities and the Jing'an Temple Police Station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e56">According to Western Newspapers: The Truth about Gambling Dens in Western Shanghai; Twenty-Two Gambling Dens Protected by Organized Gangs; Total Number of Local Thugs Reaches Around Three Thousand; Flower Lottery Gambling is Particularly Rampant <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The "North-China Daily News" reports that, according to investigations conducted by reporters over the past two weeks, there are a total of twenty-two licensed gambling dens on roads outside the settlement in the western district. They are protected by gangs organized by low-level members of society, estimated to include 660 armed men and 1,300 unarmed men. These numbers do not include the armed and unarmed "bodyguards" hired by well-known thugs running flower lottery gambling. The headquarters of the flower lottery is located in a lane on Robison Road, with about 200 branch offices set up in various areas on roads outside the settlement. Assuming that each branch office only hires one armed person and three unarmed persons, it is estimated that this city's</p>
<p>this kind of evil</p>
<p>employs a total of 2,760 local thugs. Each gambling den employs 10 to 15 armed guards, depending on its size and level, with one and a half times as many unarmed men, who are engaged in driving away idlers and keeping watch, and selecting some of them to inquire about the total turnover of competing gambling dens. In fact, the gambling dens only nominally compete with each other, as most are set up by the same group of people. These guards and their auxiliary unarmed "colleagues" receive about 35 yuan per month, plus allowances, and the allowances are always larger than the monthly salary. This group is</p>
<p>fully armed</p>
<p>with pistols, rifles, machine guns, and grenades. They meticulously observe each gambler who comes, know the names of most gamblers, and meticulously investigate their financial resources. Armed guards are not seen by people, as they all live in rooms at key points, working day and night. Each gambling den is equipped with a sophisticated alarm system, and protecting the large sums of money inside the gambling den is one of the guards' main tasks. Large gambling dens have about 300,000 yuan, with about 20,000 yuan placed on the gambling tables, and the remainder in meticulously guarded safes.</p>
<p>Unarmed thugs</p>
<p>wait near the gambling den, so that they can report if the gambling den is about to be attacked. Most of the guards are from Jiangbei and Ningbo, with the majority being former armed bandits or assassins. In addition to monthly salary and allowances, food and accommodation are provided by the gambling den. They also get a chance to gamble when off duty, so most of their income returns to the silver chests of the gambling den operators. There have been reports of these thugs robbing gamblers of their winnings, which they vehemently deny. However, it is a well-known fact that if someone who does not gamble often wins more than 3,000 or 4,000 yuan in one go, they will be "taken care of" by thugs when they leave the gambling den. The most recent incident occurred at a gambling den on Rue Remi. The mastermind behind the flower lottery is the famous</p>
<p>underworld</p>
<p>figure Gao Lansheng. In addition to the flower lottery, he also runs other gambling operations. On the evening of June 16, he was shot and seriously injured when he left a brothel on Shantou Road. Gao is nicknamed "Pockmarked Ah Gen." His wife has been repeatedly threatened by enemies in the opium and gambling business in recent years. The most affected by the scourge of the flower lottery are the coolie class. The smallest bet is only one copper coin, which pays 29 times if it wins. In parts of the western district outside the Public Settlement Police District, there are now about 200 flower lottery branch offices, which also employ armed guards, with unarmed persons serving as scouts and lookouts. The headquarters of the flower lottery employs 30 armed guards, with one at each branch office,</p>
<p>guarding all day long</p>
<p>and then escorting the day's earnings to the headquarters on Robison Road. The gambling dens and flower lottery offices described in this article are all licensed by the "Da Dao" authorities. It is said that this is a large source of income for the "Da Dao" government, so it can be stated with certainty that the total number of local thugs who directly live off this kind of evil in the Japanese-occupied areas of Shanghai is about 3,000, with armed thugs accounting for one-third. This does not include those in Pudong. In recent months, the opium and gambling business in Pudong has also flourished.</p>

<p>The military discipline inspection groups of the National Government's military regions recently received an order from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, stipulating that front-line combat troops in all war zones, regardless of officers or soldiers, are strictly prohibited from bringing dependents. Those who dare to disobey will be punished according to military law and will not be leniently treated. Starting from July 1, if it is found that front-line combat troops in any war zone are still carrying dependents and moving with the army, or using military vehicles to transport dependents' personal belongings, in addition to ordering the vehicles and occupants to be impounded and severely punished, the responsible officers should also be jointly held accountable. In addition to issuing separate orders, a special telegram was sent to those responsible for inspection to maintain military discipline.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Lao Zha Police Station's Chinese head detective Bai Fumin and detective Song Wenqing were ordered to search various hotels. When they searched Room 26 of the Zhongxing Hotel at No. 11, Lane 513, Hankou Road, they found that the occupants, Ding Haiyang, Xu Yunyan, and a woman named Ding Li, were behaving suspiciously. They searched the room and seized several notebooks, several seals, and blank epidemic prevention certificates. The detectives suspected that Ding was selling counterfeit epidemic prevention certificates and passes, so they were detained and taken back to the police station. Subsequently, more notebooks, seals, and blank epidemic prevention certificates bearing the name of Dr. Yuan Xingfu (No. 459 Elgin Road), as well as many blank temporary permits from the Japanese Navy, were seized from Room 9 of the Yongan Inn at No. 10, Lane 127, Fujian Road. They were all taken to the police station and yesterday handed over to the Fourth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Meng Tingke opened the court for interrogation. Police lawyer Qian Zhijiu explained the process, stating that the matter had not yet been thoroughly investigated, so he requested permission for the suspects to be temporarily detained for a week for detailed investigation to determine whether or not to prosecute them. After questioning by Judge Meng, they were ordered to be returned to custody and re-examined in a week.</p>

<p>The Lao Xie Da Xiang Silk and Cloth Shop in the French Concession's Great World is owned by Sun Zhaoming and others from Nanhui. Over the years, they have made tens of thousands of dollars in profits due to their agile sales tactics. Last month, they were bombed twice, shocking society. The owner of the shop, Sun Zhaoming, was sentenced to life imprisonment by the local court four years ago for murdering two relatives, Zhu Ah Lan and his nephew, from Nanhui. After being released from prison, Sun stayed at home, residing at No. 20, Zhenping Lane, Rue Cardinal Foch all day long,</p>
<p>smoking opium.</p>
<p>Sun has a large opium addiction and needs to smoke about 30 yuan worth of opium every day, so he buys a large amount each time. To avoid attracting attention, Sun changed his name from Sun Zhaoming to Sun Zhiting and lived with his wife, Sun Chen (25 years old, from Changshu), and his younger brother, Sun Zhiyao, in the same house, spending their days smoking opium. This was learned by the anti-narcotics section of the French Police Department's criminal division. The police believed that Sun was committing a crime by buying and openly smoking large quantities of opium within the concession, so they went to the address to arrest him at 2 PM on the 24th of last month. Sun, who was sleeping upstairs, was shocked upon hearing the news and quickly</p>
<p>escaped over the roof to hide temporarily.</p>
<p>His younger brother, Sun Zhiyao, and his wife, Sun Chen, were arrested because they did not have time to escape. More than 100 taels of opium were seized on the spot. After Sun Zhiyao and others were arrested, the police paid close attention to Sun Zhiting's whereabouts and worked hard to investigate. Sun Zhiyao was released on the 27th because he was not suspected of smoking opium. His wife, Sun Chen, was sent to the Second Special District Court because the evidence of her possession of opium was conclusive. Sun Chen was sentenced to three months in prison for possessing opium, but considering that it was her first offense, she was allowed to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, calculated at three yuan per day. More than 100 taels of opium seized were confiscated.</p>

<p>According to the French newspaper "Journal de Shanghai" on the 30th, the Japanese military spokesman stated at the Japanese news briefing yesterday that there have been incidents of peeping at telephone lines in the Hongqiao district for some time. In order to eliminate this, the Japanese army has set up sentries at certain distances along the railway line. These sentries, being isolated and helpless in the dark, pay more attention to movements from all directions. This is different from patrol soldiers in teams. It is recalled that on Tuesday (27th) night, a sentry suddenly saw a dark shape approaching the railway line. He flashed his flashlight to ask for the route, but suspecting that it was a thief, he fired a warning shot, without actually aiming. Afterwards, the other side also fired, so he fired back in response, resulting in a gun battle. According to the Japanese investigation, the French police officer, Russian police officer Kott, was wounded and killed by the first shot. Therefore, without waiting for the French authorities to protest, they sent liaison officers and the Hongqiao District Commander to the French Defense Forces Headquarters yesterday afternoon to explain and express their condolences. It is recently heard that the French military authorities are satisfied with the Japanese explanation, so according to the spokesman, this case has been settled. The spokesman also said that two thieves had been captured in that area before, one was executed by firing squad, and the other was sentenced to two years in prison.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that Russian police officer Kott No. 49 of the French Police Station was suddenly shot by thugs at around 11:40 PM on the 27th of last month while on duty in Panjiazhai, Tushanwan. The bullet entered from the upper left waist and exited from the right waist, causing him to die from serious injuries. It is learned that the police officer's funeral will be held on the 3rd of this month (Monday). The funeral service will be held at 9:45 AM on the same morning at the morgue at No. 300, Rue Talas. The body of the police officer will be buried in the Xujiahui Cemetery.</p>

<p>Hu Chichang, nicknamed "Jiangbei Little Tycoon" from Yancheng, currently living in Jing'an Villa in Western Shanghai, had his parents and two younger brothers living in his hometown. After the August 13th Incident in 1937, they all came to Shanghai to live with Hu. On the night of the third day of the eighth lunar month of that year, Hu's father, Zhenxue, suddenly jumped off a building and was injured and died. It has been two years since then. Now his two younger brothers, Yuanchang and Shunchang, hired attorney Shi Jiutang to file a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Local Court against Chichang for</p>
<p>plotting to murder their father,</p>
<p>embezzling his estate, and abandoning his younger brothers. They claimed that their father brought important items with him when he came, but the defendant made things difficult for him day and night, extorting money, and even beating him, causing their father to commit suicide. After the 64 mu of farmland in Yancheng left by their father was taken care of by the defendant in his capacity as the eldest brother, he privately mortgaged it to Jin Hantai to obtain funds to go to another port and even drove out his younger brother, Shunchang. They also filed a civil lawsuit, demanding the return of the land deeds. However, Hu Chichang also hired a lawyer to argue that his father suffered from mental illness and fell and injured himself when he jumped off the building. It had been investigated</p>
<p>and verified by the police and the court.</p>
<p>The ancestral property was kept by the mother and had not been mortgaged. As for supporting his younger brother, his mother was still alive, and the defendant was not responsible for this. Yesterday, Judge Jiang summoned both the plaintiffs and the defendant and witnesses for questioning. Hu Chichang had his paralyzed old mother brought to the court to prove that her father was not murdered and that the property had not been mortgaged. After questioning in court, the defendant Hu Chichang was declared not guilty, and the civil lawsuit filed by the plaintiffs was dismissed.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Pinghu route, which had just resumed operation recently, was suspended again yesterday. It is said that there has been fighting in Pinghu for several days. Currently, of the inland waterway routes from Shanghai to various guerrilla areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, only those to Suzhou, Wuxi, and Minhang and Ye Xie in the suburbs of Shanghai can barely operate. Routes to other places are still suspended.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that Shanghai-inland passenger and cargo transport has always used Jiangyin Zhangjiagang as a key transshipment point. After the area was occupied by the Japanese army, the routes were suspended and switched to Yangtan Port for transshipment. However, there has been fighting at Yangtan Port from time to time, and the routes have been opening and closing intermittently. Having just recently reopened, they were suspended again yesterday. It is reported that guerrillas rushed into Yangtan Port and launched an attack on the evening of the 29th, resulting in fighting and chaos.</p>

<p>The Japanese puppets are actively implementing control over vegetables and food.

Since the announcement of this measure on the 27th, Japanese troops in Minhang have intercepted unregistered cargo ships on the river surface, totaling more than 300 ships in the past three days. They have not been released as of yesterday. The puppet authorities will also set up puppet "vegetable markets" in Pudong Dongchang Road and Xujiahui Caojiadu in July to control the import of vegetables into the concession and collect a disguised "likin tax."</p>

After being bewitched, Yang's affection for his wife, Wang Shuxia, waned, and he often abused her. Wang initially did not understand the reason for her husband's change of heart until Xu Maochang exposed the affair last winter and reported it to the police, who arrested Qin and Yang together in the Cangzhou Hotel. During the interrogation by the First Special District Local Court, the truth was revealed. Later, Xu</p>
<p>settled out of court</p>
<p>by withdrawing the charges. It was difficult to agree with him, so the police were requested to file a lawsuit against Qin and Yang for adultery. After investigation, Xu, Qin, and Yang Jinglun were sentenced to imprisonment. Therefore, Wang Shuxia recently filed a lawsuit with the Civil Court for divorce from Yang based on the facts that her husband had committed adultery with others and abused her, and demanded compensation for losses. The</p>
<p>court hearing</p>
<p>has been reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that, after repeated mediation and persuasion by the relatives of both plaintiffs and defendants and the plaintiff's attorneys Jiang Yiping and Yang Yunshi, they reconciled. Yang Jinglun also admitted his previous mistakes and was willing to write a letter of repentance to reassure his wife of his future intentions. Therefore, Wang Shuxia has forgiven him and abandoned the divorce claim. Yesterday morning, when the continuation hearing was due, Judge Gui repeatedly enlightened both parties in court, and they reached</p>
<p>settlement terms</p>
<p>(1) The plaintiff and defendant will continue to live together in the future and be reconciled as before. (2) The defendant will pay the plaintiff 3,000 national currency, of which 1,000 yuan will be paid within two months, and the remaining amount will be paid in twelve months. (3) The 100 mu of farmland in Wuxi will be managed by the plaintiff. (4) If the defendant abuses the plaintiff again in the future to the point of being unable to live together and commits adultery again, the plaintiff may request a divorce and the defendant must pay 50,000 yuan. The couple signed the settlement record and returned home hand in hand. A storm has been settled.</p>

<p>Yunfei Automobile Company 20th Anniversary Special Issue</p>
<h3 id="e78">An Overview of Yunfei Automobile Company's Progress Over the Past 20 Years <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Yunfei Automobile Company was founded in July of the eighth year of the Republic of China (1919), and it has been 20 years since then. It is famous throughout the city for its substantial capital, outstanding talent, perfect equipment, and strict management. Yunfei currently has hundreds of cars, more than a dozen branch stations, experienced drivers, and carefully inspected vehicles. Based on the spirit of serving society and with the convenience and safety of passengers as the premise, it goes all out without the slightest懈怠. Therefore, its business has been booming over the years, and the taxi as a necessary tool for transportation has also been generally recognized by the society, no longer regarded as a luxury item for pleasure. Yunfei's contribution to this is truly undeniable, and its future development is immeasurable. Now, on the occasion of the company's 20th anniversary, we will briefly describe Yunfei's overview:</p>
<p>Founding Era Yunfei Automobile Company began operations on July 1, 1919, with its address at No. 77 Huanlong Road in the French Concession. At that time, there were only ten taxis, all with open tops. There were only nine internal employees, and the total number of drivers and coppersmiths was no more than 20. The telephone number was initially "West 189," because the telephone company still used a regional numbering system at that time. After the automatic machine was modified, Yunfei's number was also changed, which is now the well-known "30189."</p>
<p>Adding Branch Stations Yunfei opened for a few years, and business in the commercial area gradually developed. In order to meet the needs, it first established a branch station on Renji Road. Since then, business has become more prosperous and the needs have become more urgent. Yunfei's branch stations have also been established everywhere, such as the three branch stations on Renji Road, Edward Road, and the Bund, which are specially established to facilitate passengers getting on and off the writing room. The Park Road Station, Manshi Road Station, and Nanjing Theater Branch Station are especially convenient for theatergoers to rent a car for transportation. Other stations, such as Huanlong Road Station, Jing'an Temple Station, and Yidingpan Road Station, are the main bases for supplying vehicles. Vehicles enter and exit, day and night, and the distribution is extremely convenient. Therefore, Yunfei customers can call a car at any time and arrive immediately, which is very convenient. Yunfei's branch stations are also equipped with reception rooms with comfortable seats, so that passengers can rest for a while without having to wait on the spot. In addition to having many branch stations, Yunfei also pioneered the establishment of proxy call offices, entrusting stores in various districts to call cars on their behalf to facilitate passengers. At the same time, it also took the lead in adopting the latest American electric clocks, which are accurate in time and simple in code. All stations adopt them uniformly, and the time is accurate to the second, so there will be no errors in calculating the travel time. All these are for the convenience of passengers.</p>
<p>Continuing to Purchase New Cars Yunfei Automobile Company has expanded its business, and the original vehicles are not enough to be distributed. It has added new cars many times. Now, in order to ensure that customers enjoy the ultimate comfort of riding, and at a time when foreign exchange is tight and car prices are soaring, it has ordered dozens of 1939 eight-cylinder sedans, which have been added to the dispatch starting in February of this year. It is expected that all of them will arrive in the near future. At that time, most of Yunfei's dispatch vehicles will be the latest eight-cylinder sedans, which are comfortable, stable, and fast. From the customer's point of view, what they enjoy is no different from having their own car, which has the convenience of having their own car without the expense of owning one.</p>
<p>General Situation of the Head Office Yunfei's business has advanced by leaps and bounds, and the original head office was not enough to expand. Therefore, on the Double Tenth Festival in the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934), it moved to the new site at No. 76 Daxi Road, which covers an area of more than 17 acres. The vastness of the foundation and the grandeur of the scale are the only ones seen in Shanghai's car dealership. As for the organization and facilities, they are even more complete. The head office has a general management office, an accounting office, a mechanical office, a vehicle office, and a mechanical parts warehouse, a tire department, a paint department, a uniform room, a carpenter's room, a battery room, a vehicle inspection room, a lathe room, a gasoline room, a tailor's room, a dormitory, a library, a dining room, a bathroom, a barber shop, and a kitchen. In addition, there is also a medical certificate office, which hires more than a dozen famous Chinese and Western doctors at sea to provide free diagnosis and treatment for employees and drivers all year round. Because of the large number of people, the company spends a considerable amount of money each year on medical expenses, which shows the generous treatment of employees and drivers.</p>
<p>Inspecting Vehicles Yunfei Automobile Company has spent huge sums of money to purchase the latest hydraulic lift to inspect vehicles. All vehicles are required to enter the dock for inspection every ten days and be given various small repairs. Every ten months, the car is completely disassembled and repaired separately. For example, the chassis is repaired by the chassis room, and the engine is repaired by the machine room, so that it is perfect and no different from a new one. Other parts such as crankshafts and transmissions are all subject to final inspection and then reassembled into a car. The various parts prepared are too numerous to count. Springs, spark plugs, etc. are also displayed in an orderly manner for replacement at any time. In addition, all parts used in the car body, such as door locks, etc., and various tools used in the machine room are all self-made and do not need to be sought outside. This shows the magnificence of its scale, the perfection of its equipment, and the sophistication of its technology. As for seeing the working conditions at that time, it can be deeply believed that Yunfei Automobile's safe and fast ride, giving passengers convenience and safety, has gone through a lot of heavy work.</p>
<p>Driver Training Yunfei Company is extremely cautious in selecting drivers, so its restrictions are strict. The Yunfei Vehicle Office knows that the issue of driver training should be given extreme attention. Therefore, it often convenes drivers at the general company to teach them all the knowledge about their work, explaining it repeatedly and seeking detailed information. The main point of its training is, of course, safety as the highest principle. Therefore, the necessary knowledge about machinery, as well as traffic regulations and first aid knowledge, are all emphasized. As for being familiar with the route and treating customers kindly and humbly, they are essential conditions for serving as a Yunfei driver. In short, safety and service are the two major goals that Yunfei strives to train drivers in. Pay Attention to Tires Tire damage, deflation, or bursting are not only a loss for the company, but also inconvenience passengers, as they may delay important matters. Yunfei's entire dispatch vehicle has rarely had tire deflation or bursts in the middle of the road. This is because Yunfei does not hesitate to use high prices to use particularly good tires and pays special attention to whether the tire pressure is appropriate. Yunfei is considerate of passengers in terms of safety, comfort, and time economy.</p>
<p>Car Body Paint Yunfei cars are generally disassembled, washed, and repaired separately during annual overhauls, and then reassembled into a car. The painting room applies paint, and all painting procedures are no different from those of a new car. Yunfei's head office has three painting rooms, all of which use special strong lights to facilitate the progress of the work. As for the paint, the most expensive special car paint is selected, and two types of brown-yellow colors are painted, shining brightly and shiningly, adding to the spectacle. Yunfei has more than 200 cars, and each car must be repainted every eleven months, so the amount of paint used each year is amazing.</p>
<p>Preserving Lost Items It is generally believed that if you lose an item in a taxi, there is no hope of it being returned, but this view is not true of Yunfei cars. Try visiting Yunfei's head office, and the lost and found department is clearly presented to the eyes. The department has specially made shelves and sealed them. All lost items found in each car at ordinary times, regardless of size or value, are generally collected in it and the date of collection and the car number are listed to await the owner's claim.</p>
<p>Giving Telephone Signs In order to eliminate the trouble of checking the number when calling, Yunfei first gave out two types of telephone signs, one for residential use and one for shop use. Since the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), they have been given out once every year without interruption.</p>
<p>Telephone Homophones "30189" is a well-known telephone number, and Yunfei has created homophones into sentences "Sui Lin Banquet Wine Cup" and slang "Three Fists One Cup of Wine" in order to help people in all walks of life to be elegant and to make it easier for customers to remember it forever.</p>

<h3 id="e82">A Glimpse of the Yunfei Main Switchboard <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Latest Telephone Scientific Management Dispatching Vehicles Answering Calls Well-Organized Extremely Fast</p>
<p>30189 30189, has almost become a well-known telephone number in Shanghai. The reason for this is that Yunfei's perfect and excellent service over the years has led to it, and the reason why its service has achieved such satisfactory results is that its excellent telephone organization has a great relationship with it. Now, we will briefly describe the general situation of the Yunfei main switchboard, which may also be something that readers would like to hear.</p>
<p>Latest Telephone The Yunfei main switchboard is located on the second floor of the company's Jing'an Temple Station. The telephones installed in it are the latest products custom-made by famous American manufacturers. The sophistication of its structure, the density of its organization, and the convenience of its management and operation are unmatched in Shanghai. Its price is high, but Yunfei is happy to purchase it for the sake of serving people throughout the city.</p>
<p>Red Light The machine has three rows of red, green, and white lights. The red light has nine lights, representing nine lines. If a red light is on, it means that a telephone is calling. If there are nine telephones calling at the same time, all the red lights will light up at the same time. Yunfei telephone number 30189 has only one number, but in fact it has nine lines. In addition, the operators are well-trained and responsive, so customers can connect to the telephone at any time and will never have to wait repeatedly.</p>
<p>Green Light The red light is on, and the operator immediately answers the call. Then the green light lights up, and the red light can light up again when another telephone is received to exert its function. After the operator answers, they immediately inform the nearest station to send a car. Its flexibility and speed are indeed such that the car arrives as soon as the bell rings. The Yunfei main switchboard is fully equipped with scientific soundproofing equipment, so there are no noisy sounds that can disturb the operator's hearing. The operator can concentrate on the work, and the telephone is so sophisticated, so the answering of telephones and the dispatching of vehicles are well-organized and extremely fast.</p>
<p>White Light The white light is installed on the intercom line. When the branch station and the main switchboard are talking to each other, the white light lights up as soon as the handset is picked up. When the other party answers, the green light immediately follows the white light. Because lighting is used instead of ringing, the sound of the conversation is very clear.</p>
<p>Dedicated Operator The Yunfei main switchboard has twelve operators, divided into three shifts, with four people in each shift, stationed full-time, working day and night, so no matter when you call a car, you will respond quickly and arrive as soon as you call, and there are very few delays or waiting for a connection.</p>
<p>What is especially worth mentioning is that the Yunfei general management office can connect to the main switchboard with a transfer machine at any time in its office to listen to whether the operator's response is fulfilling its duties, and all its management has been completely scientific.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Yunfei Trademark <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The taxi company uses the car as a tool for business, and the wheel is the most important part of the car. The reason why Yunfei Automobile Company's trademark is shaped like a wheel is that it takes its meaning from this. Ordinary stores operate mainly in stores, while Yunfei uses the telephone as the hub of its business. This well-known Yunfei telephone number 30189 is so clearly located in the center of the trademark. Yunfei's main station is like the axle of a wheel, and the branch station is the spoke of a car. The ratio is appropriate and the meaning is even more pertinent. As for the eight characters "Yunfei Automobile Service Citywide" on the wheel surface, it is the principle that Yunfei adheres to, and it has indeed reached the point of being consistent in name and reality. Yunfei Trademark participated in the trademark competition organized by the Shishi Xinbao and won the first prize.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Yunfei Car Badge <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>The picture shows the car badge of Yunfei Automobile, which is triangular in shape, with the name Yunfei and the telephone number in the center. Yunfei has two hundred and several dozen cars, and each car has this triangular mark painted on the top and rear. It is simple and clear. Even if the customer is on several floors, they can know for sure that Yunfei Automobile is waiting outdoors as soon as they see this sign. Yunfei's facilities are all based on the convenience and safety of customers, and the use of triangular car badges is one example.</p>

<p>Metong Automobile Company (as shown in the picture) at the intersection of Myers Road and Route Foch in this city has complete equipment and a grand scale, and can be called one of the largest automobile companies in the world. General Manager Mr. Biers has been managing Ford products for a very early time. The history is long, and the development of Shanghai complements each other. Auto parts are necessary for Ford car owners and car dealerships. Mr. Clifforo Rockger, director of the company's parts department, has 21 years of professional experience in auto parts. He has been working with Manager Bi since 1921. Under his management, the company can continuously supply a large number of Ford parts to meet the needs of thousands of Ford car owners and those who own a large number of Ford vehicles. The company's repair department is newly equipped with ten hydraulic lifts to facilitate workers standing for repairs, and the light is also very bright. In addition, the battery room, wheel alignment station, and test room are all available. Mr. Cheli John, director of the repair department, is shrewd and capable, and has a wealth of experience. He has a high reputation in the auto service industry. The repair workers are specially trained. Sometimes, after the work is completed, they must gather and listen quietly to the director or Ford Motor Company engineering experts lecturing on the repair project and the usage of new-style machines. The company's paint shop is brightly lit, and in addition to ordinary paint, it is also equipped with the latest invented baking enamel machine for painting new-style Fords, Mavericks, Lincoln Safire, etc. Other equipment, such as the repair tool room, tire repair department, and car body manufacturing department, are all perfectly equipped with excellent workmanship and materials.

<h3 id="e89">Overview of Traffic Regulations in Hengyang <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>— Quechang</p>
<p>Hengyang is located on the upper reaches of the Xiang River and is the center of the Yuehan Railway and the starting point of the Xianggui Railway. Highways extend in all directions, and transport ships can navigate, making it a major transportation hub with access to all directions. The highways extend east through Jiangxi to Fujian, west to Guiyang and then into Sichuan and Yunnan, south to Guangdong and Guangxi, and north to Hubei. Water transportation depends on the water conditions. In winter, the water dries up, and navigation is suspended. In the other three seasons, navigation is possible between Baifang, Changsha, and Hengyang. However, since the fall of Han, Yue, and Gan, the traffic situation in this transportation hub has also been affected. Although the railway and highway routes remain the same, they are no longer smooth. The current situation is described below:</p>
<p>(A) Railway: (1) The Yuehan Railway has now shortened its route, only reaching Lechang to the south and Zhuzhou to the north, with Laiyang, Chen County, and Hengshan as stations in between. The ticket prices from Hengyang to Laiyang are: express train, first class 3.6 yuan, second class 2.3 yuan, third class 1.15 yuan; slow train, first class 3 yuan, second class 2 yuan, third class 1 yuan. To Chen County by express train, first class 8.25 yuan, second class 5.3 yuan, third class 2.65 yuan; slow train, first class 7.05 yuan, second class 4.7 yuan, third class 2.35 yuan. To Lechang by express train, first class 14.55 yuan, second class 9.4 yuan, third class 4.7 yuan; slow train, first class 12.7 yuan, second class 8.5 yuan, third class 4.25 yuan. From Hengyang north to Hengshan, express train, first class 3.3 yuan, second class 2.1 yuan, third class 1.05 yuan; slow train, first class 2.7 yuan, second class 1.8 yuan, third class 0.9 yuan. To Zhuzhou by express train, first class 7.8 yuan, second class 5 yuan, third class 2.5 yuan; slow train, first class 6 yuan, second class 4.4 yuan, third class 2.2 yuan. For luggage, a fee of 0.01 yuan per kilogram per kilometer is charged for exceeding the limit. There is one express train and one slow train each way. The express train takes about 11 hours from Hengyang to Lechang and about 5 hours to Zhuzhou. The slow train takes about 15 hours from Hengyang to Lechang and about 5.5 hours to Zhuzhou. (2) The Xianggui Railway runs directly from Hengyang to Guilin North Station, passing through Lijiaping, Lengshuitan, Xing'an, and other stations. The ticket prices from Hengyang to Lijiaping are: first class 5.55 yuan, second class 3.7 yuan, third class 1.85 yuan; to Lengshuitan, first class 7.95 yuan, second class 5.3 yuan, third class 2.65 yuan; to Xing'an, first class 16.8 yuan, second class 11.2 yuan, third class 5.6 yuan; to Guilin North Station, first class 19.95 yuan, second class 10.3 yuan, third class 6.65 yuan. The journey from Hengyang to Guilin takes about 16.5 hours. For luggage exceeding the weight limit, the fee is calculated at 0.01 yuan per kilogram per kilometer.</p>
<p>(B) Highway: (1) Hengyang to Changsha, 184 kilometers, ticket price 9.2 yuan, about 7.5 hours. (2) Hengyang to Xiangtan, 134 kilometers, ticket price 6.7 yuan, about 4 hours. (3) Hengyang to Baoqing, 136 kilometers, ticket price 6.8 yuan, journey 5 hours and 10 minutes. (4) Via Qiyang to Lingling, 157 kilometers, ticket price to Qiyang 5.2 yuan, to Lingling 7.85 yuan. Journey to Qiyang 3.5 hours, to Lingling 5 hours and 15 minutes. (5) From Hengyang East Station via Laiyang to Yizhang, 193 kilometers, ticket price to Laiyang 3.1 yuan, to Yizhang 9.65 yuan, journey to Laiyang 2 hours, to Yizhang 6 hours. (6) From Hengyang East Station to Jiehualong, 235 kilometers, ticket price 11.75 yuan. The free luggage allowance for each route is 20 kilograms. For each additional 10 kilograms, the responsible party charges 0.065 yuan per kilometer, and the passenger pays 0.06 yuan.</p>
<p>(C) Waterway: (1) Hengyang to Xiangtan, small steamboats operate, departing at 6:00 AM daily, ticket price 1.6 yuan. (2) Hengyang to Qiyang, also small steamboats operate, departing at 7:00 AM daily, ticket price 2 yuan. (3) To Lingling, passengers share the same boat as those going to Qiyang, ticket price 3 yuan.</p>
<p>(D) Joint Transportation between Hunan and Jiangxi: In addition to the above waterway transportation, the Hunan South Highway Bureau and the Jiangxi Highway Bureau jointly operate a joint transportation service between Hunan and Jiangxi, allowing passengers to reach Ji'an, Jiangxi from Hengyang on the same day. Each day, each side operates three passenger cars, all departing at 5:00 AM, ticket price 20.44 yuan per person, journey of one day, with meals in Jiehualong, total distance 440 li.</p>
<h3 id="e90">Post-War Shipping on the Lesser Yangtze River <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, at the end of the Yangtze River, there was a ship like the Victoria (over 200 tons, not the ocean-going mail ship operated by the Italian Postal Shipping Company) traveling between the Shanghai pontoon bridge (Qiyakou). This location is between Taicang and Changshu, and passengers and goods could travel east to Taicang, west to Changshu, and then transferred to various places in Suxi. At that time, Shanghai was facing a food crisis, and the interior was experiencing a severe shortage of daily necessities, so merchants were engaged in round-trip trading, and everyone made several times the profit. Shipping companies also greatly increased freight rates (rice freight was about 1.2 yuan per bag, compared to only 0.2 yuan before the war; cattle freight required more than 20 yuan per head), and also made huge profits. This was the most prosperous period of the Lesser Yangtze River shipping industry after the war. In the spring of last year, the shipping industry saw profits, and small companies sprang up like mushrooms after rain, with a large increase in the number of ships, and the routes were also extended to the area of Baimao Kou Changyinsha. At the same time, the Beisha routes to ports such as Hutong, Shuji, Niuhong, Lingdian, and Sanhe also opened one after another. During this period, although there were many ships, the number of ports also increased, so both passenger and freight transport were still busy. At that time, the ships operating included Victoria, Mini Maller, Henry, Hyde, Haiyi, Changde, Fulu, Deyao, Haikang, and several ships from Jardine Matheson and Taikoo, totaling more than a dozen ships.</p>
<p>By summer and autumn, new ports appeared one after another, with Hupukou taking a unique advantage due to its geographical location. This place is only a dozen li from Changshu County, with convenient transportation. Changshu and neighboring Kunshan are both rice-producing areas. At that time, land routes were blocked and food could only be transported through Hupu.) Freight transport suddenly became developed. Every day, 7,000 to 8,000 bags of rice were exported from there. At this time, the regular ships that went directly to Hupukou included Jiangding, Xin Jiangnan, Kaishi Deng, and Wo Leif, etc. Other ships also stopped at this port, totaling no less than thirty ships. However, with so many ships, competition became fierce, and freight rates dropped sharply (the lowest rice freight rate dropped to below 0.3 yuan per bag, and cattle freight dropped to 7 or 8 yuan per head.) By winter, passenger and freight traffic decreased, and local bans on rice exports led to a de facto standstill due to lack of goods to transport. However, the two ports of Xinsheng and Zhanghuang (south of Rugao in Jiangbei) successively opened, and at the end of the year, a large number of marinated meat, cattle, peanuts, and lard were transported to Shanghai, and shipping in these ports was also temporarily booming. (That is, most of the pigs eaten in this city are still transported from that port.) Since this spring, trains and cars have been passing through, and now that it is the time of year when the old and new crops meet, freight transport is scarce, so the ships have stopped operating one after another. Currently, only Deyao, Changde, Haiyi, Haikang, Kaishi Deng, Xin Jiangnan, and several ships from Yi Tai are still operating.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Ford's Contribution <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>This year's five Ford vehicles, in their size, style, power, and price, all meet your needs, and their value is always associated with the Ford name. Among them, Ford and Lincoln are distinctly different. Today, people in society feel the need for various cars between Ford and Lincoln. The Ford Motor Company has continuously produced various noble and valuable unique cars to fill this gap; and the first to be launched is the Lincoln Zephyr, which has introduced the use of the 12-cylinder engine into the medium-priced car category. At the same time, new principles are applied in terms of structure and style, so that it always stays ahead of the times. The next is the introduction of the special Ford V8. And the new car that joined the noble Ford Group this year is the Mercury car, the Mercury eight-cylinder car, in the lower medium-priced car category, its position is between the special Ford Lincoln Zephyr. And its value, only factories that use special methods and resources, such as Ford, can produce it. The above five cars are better than the products of other factories and are worth buying.</p>
<p>Ford's repair service is one of the most popular car repair organizations in the world. Wherever we go, there are Ford repair services, and this service is very attentive and satisfactory. Today, Ford's repair services in the United States have thousands of locations, and there are thousands more reliable parking lots and repair stations, all with the genuine Ford parts logo. Ford dealerships everywhere are equipped with specific Ford repair tools and equipment, which are extremely accurate and reliable, saving time and money. The parts used are all genuine Ford products, and their excellent quality and precise dimensions are exactly the same as those used in the original car, and the methods set by the Ford factory make the repair costs very low.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Routes from Shanghai to the Interior <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>— Xun</p>
<p>Recently, the traffic situation from Shanghai to the interior has changed greatly. Originally, one could take the eastern Zhejiang ports such as Wenzhou or Ningbo and then pass through Jinhua and Nanchang to reach the interior. In addition, there are the ports of Fuzhou, Shantou, Guangzhou Bay, and Beihai, all of which are gateways to the interior. Now, the various shipping companies in Wenzhou, Ningbo, Fuzhou, and Beihai have successively suspended their services. Since the outbreak of war in Shantou, passenger transport has also been cut off. Although Guangzhou Bay is a French concession, the highway between the bay and Canglin has been destroyed, making travel very difficult. Therefore, taking the route through Vietnam is the only safe way. Regarding the detailed situation of this route, this publication has repeatedly recorded it.

Please see the description below for details. (2) If you want to find travel companions, please ask China Travel Service to introduce you.</p>
<p>Answer: Yingjun (1) The safest way to go to Yiwu, Zhejiang from Shanghai is to go through Wenzhou. However, it is extremely difficult to buy tickets to Wenzhou. You must have a Wenzhou local guarantor before you can go from Wenzhou through Qingtian Lishui to Jinhua, and then take the train from Jinhua to Yiwu. The total cost is about 30 yuan.</p>
<p>Answer: Luo Chongmin (1) The only safe route from Nanning, Guangxi to Shanghai is as follows: Nanning - Longzhou (bus) - Lang Son (bus) - Hanoi (train) - Haiphong (train) - Shanghai (ship). The minimum total travel cost is more than 90 yuan national currency. However, before departure, you should apply to the Guangxi government authorities for a transit passport, which takes about seventeen days.</p>
<p>Answer: Shen Baochang, Chen Yunxiang, Jin Ge, Chen Qiyu (1) The safest way to go from Shanghai to Guiyang is to take the route through Haiphong. After arriving in Haiphong by boat, one can go to Guiyang via Hanoi Lang Son Longzhou Nanning Liuzhou, which takes about six days. The lowest cost is more than 50 yuan national currency (excluding Shanghai-Haiphong boat ticket). The second is to take the train from Haiphong to Kunming, and then take the highway bus from Yunnan to Guiyang, which takes six days and costs more than 60 yuan. (2) Whether you go to Guizhou through Guangxi or Yunnan, you must have your identity certificate, which can be issued by the school or business. If not, it can be certified by a familiar shop. (3) If you do not have a substantial guarantor when requesting a signature from the French consulate, you need to pay a deposit of 200 Vietnamese dollars. (4) From Guiyang to Renhuai, you can go to Renhuai from Guiyang via Zhenqian Qianxi Jinsha. Although there is a highway in this section, there is a lack of passenger cars, making travel difficult.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Recent Developments in Universities Around the Country New School Buildings of Xiamen University in Changting Bombed Again Tsinghua University's Five Research Institutes Ready <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Xiamen University</p>
<p>(Changting Correspondent) The school buildings of Xiamen University in Xiamen were destroyed during the war. After the school moved to Changting, it was bombed by aircraft on April 7 this year. Except for student Liu Xiheng who was injured in the eye, all teachers and students were safe. Yingxuezhai and the dormitory for visiting students were completely destroyed. The office, auditorium, science laboratories, Tongan Hall, the third-grade dormitory, and the commissioner's office in Zone 4 were also partially collapsed, with an estimated loss of more than 3,000 yuan. Since the bombing, the school has designated evacuation locations and revised class schedules, and classes have resumed on May 1.</p>
<p>Peking University</p>
<p>(Kunming Correspondent) The Institute of Liberal Arts of Peking University was suspended during the war. It is now scheduled to resume in the next academic year and recruit ten graduate students. The subjects are divided into five departments: history, linguistics, Chinese literature, archeology, and anthropology. The salary is 50 yuan per month for living expenses. The examination is divided into two phases. The first time to receive papers is July 15, and the examination is on August 5. The second time to receive papers is August 30, and the examination is on September 15. Candidates who pass the preliminary review of their documents and papers will be notified separately to take the exam in Kunming or Chongqing. The registration location is No. 2, Caisheng Lane, Kunming.</p>
<p>Tsinghua University</p>
<p>(Kunming Correspondent) All the school buildings of Tsinghua University in Beiping and the South Courtyard where the members of the Management Committee lived are now stationed by troops. This spring, someone came from Beiping and said that the library was used as a hospital for wounded soldiers, and the new gymnasium and biology museum were used as stables. The loss of equipment, books, and instruments in the new South Courtyard Club and various museums is difficult to describe. The school moved to Yunnan and was renamed Southwest Associated University. In April last year, there were more than 600 students, and more than 200 students graduated in July. There were more than 200 faculty members. The school buildings were rented. The organization is divided into four colleges of liberal arts, law, science, and engineering, and eighteen departments (Chinese literature, foreign languages, history and society, philosophy and psychology, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, geology, geography and meteorology, law, politics, economics, commerce, civil engineering, mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, chemical engineering, aviation). A normal college was established last summer. In February this year, a telecommunications training course was attached to the Department of Electrical Engineering, with a study period of half a year, to train technical talents. The source of funds for the Associated University is 40% of the original funds of Peking University and Tsinghua University, and 40% of the subsidy that Nankai should receive from the Ministry of Education, totaling less than 80,000 yuan per month. Fortunately, the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund and the China Cultural Foundation subsidized books and instruments at the beginning of the school, and slightly replenished them. As for the construction costs, about 200,000 yuan was collected from a part of the subsidy from the China Foundation and the remaining funds of the three schools. Last summer and autumn, the number of students increased sharply. In the 28th academic year, with the approval of the Ministry of Education, the remaining funds of Tsinghua in the first half of the year were allocated to increase 15,000 yuan per month. In terms of research work, in addition to the original three research institutes of agriculture, aviation, and radio, two institutes of national conditions census and metallurgy were added last autumn. These five institutes are ready and the work has made considerable progress. Tsinghua's public-funded students studying in the United States were temporarily suspended from taking the examination last summer. There are still 40 to 50 people who have studied in Europe and the United States before, and the living expenses of these two items have been reduced to save money.</p>
<p>Zhejiang University</p>
<p>(Yishan Correspondent) After Zhejiang University moved to Yishan, the second, third, and fourth grades started classes on November 1 last year. The first-grade freshmen started classes two months later because the unified enrollment was announced later. In the first semester of the 27th academic year, there were a total of 362 first-grade students, 188 second-grade students, 154 third-grade students, and 88 fourth-grade students. Due to the increase in the number of normal colleges and students, teachers have also been slightly added. The normal college has 81 first-grade freshmen. A preparatory class was added this spring, and more than 50 people have arrived. In order to help poor students and students who have withdrawn from the war zone, in addition to the quotas for public-funded students and free students, the school has recently implemented a loan system on a wider scale. Some students earn a living by serving in the military. From the president to the faculty, most of them have moved their salaries and wedding and funeral gifts to scholarships and donations to comfort the wounded and killed soldiers. The school was bombed once on February 5, but fortunately no one was injured. A part of the office and dormitory was destroyed, with a loss of 30,000 yuan. The faculty and staff then donated 4,000 yuan to help the students. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, classes have been evacuated to a safe area.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Hua Dong Christian Nine Middle Schools Held Joint Graduation Ceremony Yesterday. A Total of 573 Senior and Junior High School Graduates. Speeches by Gu Huiren, Luo Peide, and Jiang Guiyun <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Hua Dong Christian Nine Middle Schools held a joint graduation ceremony at the Great Shanghai Theater at 9:30 AM on the 30th. Over 1,400 students, parents, guests, faculty, and graduates attended. The Chinese national flag was hung in the auditorium, flanked by the British and American flags. The stage was decorated with more than a dozen flower baskets prepared by various schools. The meeting started on time, with the Chiang Hwa &amp; Company providing a sound system, broadcasting each item clearly and loudly. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Participating Schools</p>
<p>In terms of units, there were nine schools: Mingde Jian Shi, Qingxin Girls' Middle School, Qingxin Middle School, McLaren Middle School, Jinghai Girls' Normal School, Hujun Girls' Middle School, Biwen Girls' Middle School, Hua Dong United Middle School, and the Methodist Joint Girls' Junior Middle School. Hua Dong United Middle School included fourteen schools: Zhijiang, Trinity, Zhonghua, Hongdao, Xiuzhou, Jinling, Yuqun, Zhensheng, Chongying, Cuiying, Huiwen, Fushi, Lishi, and Huilan. The Methodist United Middle School included four schools: Yinghua, Jinghai, Hujun, and Muwei, totaling twenty-five schools.</p>
<p>Order of Proceedings</p>
<p>The meeting began with music at 9:30 AM. Guests, faculty, and students took their seats. Everyone stood at attention to listen to the national anthem and sang "O Beautiful China." Dr. Bao Zheqing offered a prayer. Principal Gu Huiren delivered the opening address. Bishop Luo Peide gave a speech. Tian Ming'en, Cao Cen, Huang Feiran, and Huang Shicheng sang a quartet. Principal Jiang Guiyun delivered a speech on behalf of the participating school principals. Diplomas were presented by individual principals. The meeting adjourned at noon.</p>
<p>Summary of Speeches</p>
<p>(1) Principal Gu Huiren stated in his opening address that he had two feelings about today's ceremony. First, all schools have school buildings and auditoriums that cannot be lived in and had to come here to borrow space for the ceremony, which is not an honor but a disgrace that everyone should remember and not forget. Second, during this time of national crisis, many have suffered directly or indirectly. You are fortunate to have received education peacefully and to have graduated, enjoying special privileges. Since you enjoy special treatment, you should strive harder to contribute and repay. (2) Bishop Luo Peide, who has been in China for over forty years, spoke fluent Chinese and quoted classical allusions from both Chinese and Western cultures, saying that even after graduation, you have only gained a superficial understanding. The path of learning is extremely profound. Even if you read a lot, entering a library and seeing the shelves full of books will make you feel inadequate. Therefore, you should continue to study hard and, most importantly, have confidence so that you do not give up halfway. (3) Principal Jiang Guiyun, on behalf of the participating principals, hoped that those who want to pursue further education will continue to do so, studying various specialized technologies to meet the needs of the times. He hoped that normal school students would lead by example, be role models for teachers, and establish a foundation for national education. He hoped that those seeking employment would maintain high moral character, develop strong physiques, cultivate a passion for research, emphasize the spirit of cooperation, and strive forward with the spirit of sacrifice and service to the public in the spirit of Christianity.</p>
<p>Issuance of Certificates</p>

<h3 id="e110">Buying Trend Unabated, Foreign Exchange Continuously Tightening <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions showed no changes in the listed prices. However, the situation in the unofficial market continued to be tight due to the continued strong demand for settlement from foreign firms. In addition, Sassoon, a Western merchant, was aggressively buying, and Youli on behalf of Tianjin gangs and a certain party followed suit. Furthermore, it was difficult for both Chinese and foreign banks to obtain foreign exchange, especially US dollars. As a result, under the triple pressure of buying, the market rarely looked back. Although they were unwilling to supply US dollars at 6.15625 pence per dollar or 12.75 yuan per dollar, they required cash payment on the spot. Other banks were unwilling to sell cheaply, and the gangs had softened to above-market prices, approaching the HSBC's maintained supply price (6.5 pence and 12.625 yuan). The market closed at the tightest price of the day, with most transactions settled by clearing accounts. The Hong Kong dollar also softened to 44 yuan. From today until July 3rd, the market will be closed for two days due to the banks' semi-annual settlement, for a total of three days including Sunday. The market will reopen as usual on July 4th.</p>
<p>Sassoon Resumes Aggressive Buying</p>
<p>In the early morning, the price of London large silver bars for both near and far dates fell by 0.25, and the price of silver in New York also fell by 0.5%. The price of gold in London remained unchanged. The exchange rates of British and American currencies remained unchanged. The exchange rate against Shanghai was 0.0625 higher, and the exchange rate against France was 0.02 higher. The US dollar was unchanged against the British pound, 0.015 lower against Shanghai, and 0.00625 lower against France. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained the same. The opening selling prices of spot currencies at banks in the morning were 6.59375 pence per British pound and 12.84375 yuan per US dollar, unchanged for the British pound and 0.03125 tighter for the US dollar compared to the previous close. After opening, a certain bank suddenly dumped currencies, stabilizing the market. It was reported that the bank sold spot US dollars to the American Bank of China at 12.875 yuan. When HSBC announced its listed prices, there were no changes. When the balance tax on silver was announced to be exempted, the major foreign firms were settling accounts frequently, and Sassoon, a Western merchant, was also aggressively buying. In addition, foreign banks such as British and American banks were unwilling to sell cheaply, so the market gradually tightened. It was reported that foreign banks such as HSBC and Standard Chartered and Chinese banks sold spot British pounds to Sassoon at 6.5625 pence. Subsequently, American Bank of China and Chinese banks also sold spot US dollars to Sassoon at 12.8125 yuan. Near noon, only the Hong Kong dollar was traded, and the spot price was only 44.25 yuan due to aggressive buying by foreign firms. It also showed signs of softening. By the noon close, the selling prices of spot currencies at banks were 6.5625 pence per British pound and 12.78125 yuan per US dollar.</p>
<p>The Tianjin Gang Also Showed Strong Absorption</p>
<p>The volume of transactions in the afternoon suddenly decreased, but the market continued to tighten because Youli, acting on behalf of the Tianjin gang and a certain party, suddenly began aggressively buying. It was reported that Youli settled with its counterparts for spot British pounds at 6.5625 pence and spot US dollars at 12.75 yuan. Afterwards, the Hong Kong dollar also softened to 44 yuan, but no transactions were reported. A foreign firm then made a purchase agreement from a foreign bank for British pounds at 6.5 pence after customs clearance (i.e., delivery on July 4th) and US dollars at only 12.625 yuan. By the late close, the selling prices of spot currencies at banks were 6.53125 pence per British pound and 12.6875 yuan per US dollar. As a result, the British pound continued to tighten by 0.0625, and the US dollar tightened by 0.1875. The Hong Kong dollar was also sold at 0.5 yuan at the final price.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Half-Day Gold Market: Volatility Decreasing, Transactions of 400 Taels <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold dark market conditions only had morning trading. All transactions made in the afternoon must be settled overnight. Because settlement fell within the customs closure period, the industry decided to suspend trading for three and a half days until July 4th (i.e., next Tuesday), when trading will resume as usual. Although yesterday morning's fluctuation was only 13 yuan, the situation remained vague. At the opening, the market once fell to a low of 2,540 yuan due to the resurgence of selling pressure from the northern gangs. Later, a certain bank frequently absorbed gold on behalf of foreign firms, and the domestic foreign exchange market tightened, causing the market to rebound and rise to a peak of 2,593 yuan. Near noon, cash gold firms sold gold, causing the price to fall back to 2,588 yuan at the close. In the afternoon, the off-floor market opened and rose to around 2,595 yuan, resulting in a closing price that was 2 yuan lower but actually 5 yuan higher. Trading was active in the half-day, with approximately 400 taels traded. The price of gold jewelry in silver shops did not change. The price of customs gold and pure gold remained unchanged.</p>
<p>No Major Changes in Gold</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the day, the northern gangs have been eager to sell gold (10 taels per bar), and retail investors were also weak, causing the opening price to fall by 5 yuan. It was reported that a securities gang sold 50 taels to a silver shop gang at a price of 2,585 yuan on behalf of a northern gang. Later, there was a shortage of buyers, and the price fell by another 5 yuan. A money exchange firm also sold 50 taels to a silver shop gang and a certain bank on behalf of a northern gang at the same price. At this time, the buying pressure from a certain bank remained strong, and the northern gangs had stopped selling and were observing. The exchange rate in Guanwai frequently turned upwards. The bank bought 50 taels from a silver shop gang and a money exchange firm each at 83 yuan. Afterwards, the supply of sellers was very weak, and the price rose rapidly by 7 yuan. The bank bought 20 taels from the silver shop gang at 90 yuan. At this time, retail investors also showed strong buying interest, and the price rose by another 3 yuan. The money exchange firm bought 10 taels from a gold shop at 93 yuan. Afterwards, a cash gold firm suddenly started selling, and the market stabilized. The cash gold firm sold 50 taels to the money exchange firm at 90 yuan. Later, the bank bought 30 taels from the cash gold firm at 92 yuan (the bank's purchases were mainly on behalf of foreign firms). Near noon, the market suddenly weakened slightly, falling by 4 yuan. The bank sold 20 taels to a money exchange firm on behalf of a customer at 2,588 yuan, which was the closing price for noon. In the afternoon, trading was suspended due to the settlement period. However, the off-floor market had risen to around 2,595 yuan, due to the continued tightening of the foreign exchange market. Compared to the noon closing price of 2,588 yuan, the result was a 2 yuan fall compared to the previous day, but in reality, it was a rise of 4-5 yuan. The selling price of the cash gold firm's own brand was 2,600 yuan, and the receipt was over 2,585 yuan. The spot gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. It was reported that few people were doing customs clearance.</p>
<p>The Price of Gold Jewelry Remained Unchanged</p>
<p>The price of gold jewelry in silver shops remained unchanged because the price of gold was rarely changing. Dà Tóng Hang still suspended gold jewlery for sales at its original price of 263 yuan, and Xīn Tóng Hang sold for 261 yuan, repurchasing at 255 yuan.</p>
<p>The Price of Pure Gold Remained Unchanged</p>
<p>According to a London cable on the 29th, the price of pure gold remained unchanged at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6.5 pence per ounce. As a result, the Central Bank of China's cash purchase price also remained at 1,212.6 yuan. The listed price of customs gold also remained unchanged at 2.396 yuan, and the standard gold price in Shanghai also remained fixed at 1,207.9 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Settlement Arrived, Discount Rate on Drafts Plunged by About 20 Yuan, Interbank Lending Rate Also Low at 0.2 <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate on exchange drafts and notes plummeted. Because banks' semi-annual settlement has arrived, those who needed cash had already discounted them several days ago. As a result, yesterday's market saw excess supply over demand. The discount rate per 1,000 yuan fell from around 90 yuan to 75 yuan. In the afternoon, it fell further to 72.5 yuan, a drop of 19.5 yuan compared to the previous day. It was reported that when banks reopen on July 4th, the silver and money industries will use interbank transfers, reducing the need for cash. The decline in the premium also had an impact, and the interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association was also lowered by 0.2, with both morning and afternoon rates at 0.2.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Large Silver Bars Entered the 18-Pence Mark <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>

India bought silver at the listed price. The prices of large silver bars for both near and far dates fell by another 0.25, entering the 18-pence mark.

<p>Yesterday, both British sovereign gold and British-American exchange rates remained unchanged. Due to banks settling accounts and foreign firms engaging in heavy payments, coupled with strong demand from Japanese banks and Western merchants, the supply of foreign exchange in the local market was sluggish. As a result, the British exchange rate was 6.625.53125, up by 0.0625 from the previous day. The American exchange rate was 12.75, also up by 0.125. The red market opened low because the bank account settlement period had arrived, and will be closed for three days starting tomorrow. Many speculators closed out their positions, and although exchange rates were tight, the red market relaxed, with transactions only reaching a low of 2,585 yuan. Money exchange businesses were sluggish, falling to a low of 80 yuan. Gold shops took the opportunity to buy low, hovering around 90 yuan. The noon closing price was 2,588 yuan, down two yuan from the previous day. No transactions were made in the afternoon, but active buyers absorbed a considerable amount, and the after-hours trading price rose to 96 yuan. The demand for foreign currencies such as British and American gold pounds was quite strong. Banks and money houses supplementing their positions further boosted the need for British and American gold notes, causing the market price to rise significantly. The demand for Hong Kong francs and other notes was also strong, with prices also rising. The evening market saw 9.90 for gold notes and 9.10 for Korean notes. There was not much trading at the guild. Qin Tai sold 500 yuan of American gold notes, Xiang Tai sold 500 yuan of American gold notes, and Ren Tai sold 100 yuan of American gold notes. Yesterday's market prices saw British gold pounds rise by 0.20, British gold notes rise by 0.40, American gold pounds rise by 0.50, American gold notes rise by 0.18, Hong Kong notes rise by 0.01, French franc notes rise by 0.002, and Canadian and Philippine notes each rise by 0.10.

<p>The stock market at the exchange was unsettled due to European news, which affected the New York stock market, causing prices to fall. The local stock market was also sluggish as a result, with few buyers. Throughout the day, only Jardine Matheson shares had transactions, with 9,300 shares traded at prices ranging from 18.60 to 18.90 yuan, with the closing bid price at 18.60 yuan. The rubber market was particularly stable. Although the European situation was tense and the American market was weak, speculators believed that rubber's position would remain strong regardless of war or peace. Furthermore, with the foreign exchange market tight, the market anticipated good results from purchasing local rubber stocks. The exchange will be closed for the summer holidays on the 1st and 3rd of this month, as usual.</p>
<p>The London market prices for Far Eastern companies' stocks on the 29th of this month (Thursday) saw a slight decline. Mercantile Bank fell by five shillings to seven pounds. Kaiping Mines shares fell by three pence to seventeen shillings and nine pence. Kulim Rubber Estates shares fell by seven and a half pence to seventeen shillings and six pence. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<p>The London market prices for Chinese foreign debt on the 29th of this month (Thursday) saw continued rises in customs-secured bonds. The British-German continuation issue and the British-French issue rose by two pounds to fifty pounds. The Reorganization British-French issue rose by one and a half pounds to thirty-four pounds. The rest remained unchanged. The Reorganization market prices were thirty-four pounds for the British-French issue, thirty-two pounds for the French issue with stamps, and twenty-nine pounds for the German issue with stamps. There was a request to sell physical goods in London, totaling 1,500 pounds of the Reorganization German issue with stamps, with a selling price of twenty-nine and a half pounds. Another 1,500 pounds were transacted, with an opening price of twenty-nine pounds. The principal and interest due on the Reorganization bonds today, totaling 1,003,737 pounds, remain temporarily unpaid.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Yarn and Cotton: Cotton Yarn Trading Dominated by Speculation; Prices Rise Again by Four to Five Yuan; Japanese Yarn Adds Water to the Exchange Rate <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The after-hours trading of cotton yarn remains ordinary, mostly speculative, and the market situation is still good. However, except for the continued purchases from Hong Kong and Yunnan merchants, there is little activity, mainly because transportation on all routes is blocked and delivery is extremely difficult. The spot market is calm, while general speculators are tight and unwilling to loosen their grip. The market opened this morning, continuing the momentum of the previous day and moving forward, but the rise was slow, with opening prices up by one or two yuan. The price of 20-count Behar yarn was 496 yuan, and the godown receipt price was 491 yuan. Shortly after, it rose by two yuan. At the same time, Hong Kong merchants had some demand, and those who profited from the high prices sold off, causing it to fall back by three yuan. The spot price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 495 yuan, and the closing godown receipt price was 488 yuan. The afternoon opening saw a significant reduction in gatherings because the market would be closed for three days starting tomorrow along with the silver houses, reopening on July 4th. As a result, everyone was hesitant, but some still expected prices to rise, and the godown receipt price of Double Horse yarn was transacted at 491 yuan. The opening price for Behar Double Horse yarn was 498 yuan, also for immediate delivery, all belonging to speculative transactions. Only 20-count Shepherd yarn was transacted at 383 yuan, with a few dozen bales purchased by Guangbang merchants for immediate delivery. It is estimated that the total purchases by famous merchants throughout the day were less than 1,000 bales, with transactions among peers being the largest number. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by four yuan, Double Globe yarn rose by four yuan, Shepherd yarn rose by five yuan, and Five Blessings yarn rose by three yuan. Today, 240 bales of 10-count Ping Jian Yun export cotton yarn were shipped to Yantai, 100 bales to Tianjin, 1,140 bales to Hong Kong, 320 bales to Guangzhou Bay, 952 bales to Beihai, and 412 bales to Haiphong.</p>
<p>Japanese cotton yarn has always been difficult to purchase. Since the Ministry of Finance issued restrictions on withdrawals, the market is short of spot yarn. Most merchants dealing in Japanese yarn are in dire straits. According to the market, they have been negotiating with Japanese trading houses. Initially, the trading houses did not agree, but the Japanese factories, both domestic and foreign, recognizing the trend, changed their approach to avoid hindering sales. They now accept drafts with a premium. It is also said that these two factories will allow half of the yarn previously offered to be delivered through drafts and half through exchanges, a special offer that merchants are happy to accept. As a result, the Japanese yarn market was more active yesterday, but actual transactions were still flat. The spot price of 20-count Gekkin yarn was 392 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Foreign Cotton Payment Issues: Trading Houses Agree to Handle Discretionally; Transactions Still Not Occurring <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The foreign cotton market was weak from the start in New York due to the deteriorating European situation, leading to overseas selling. Many traders also closed out their positions. Washington has yet to announce definite plans for export subsidies, and silver has fallen by another cent, causing extreme discouragement. The cotton district's weather reports are quite good. As a result, New York fell by 23 points yesterday, while Indian cotton futures rose by one and a half rupees, and Egyptian cotton rose by five to six pounds.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton trade in Shanghai has been quiet for many days. Yesterday was the last day for foreign exchange settlements in June. Demand for funds was quite tight in the morning. Although the critical time had passed by noon, credit conditions gradually eased. The Yarn Millers Association had convened a meeting the day before to listen to the trading houses' responses regarding payment issues for future arrivals, but no concrete and satisfactory answers were received. However, the trading houses agreed to handle the matter with discretion, which was a sign of concession.</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign cotton trade has completely stalled, but there are many disputes among the same traders buying and selling Indian cotton that was purchased earlier from trading houses. All of these issues stem from the Ministry of Finance's implementation of withdrawal restrictions. Previously, they had purchased from trading houses with a deposit of 20%, and if they could profit slightly, they would transfer it to another company, which in turn would sell it to another company. Recently, goods have arrived in Shanghai, but banks and money houses have no cash to provide, leading to numerous complications. Only 88 bales of Xasha cotton arrived at the dock. Today, 800 bales of export cotton are being shipped to Tianjin.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Piece Goods: June Futures Being Settled <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The cloth market is stable, and retailers continue to show willingness to sell off goods at lower prices, but traders' attitudes are still mostly calm. Yesterday, due to the end of the month, goods due for delivery this month were being settled, and shipments were very busy, but there was still no turnaround in sales, with only small amounts being transacted. Sichuan and Yunnan merchants purchased nearly 2,000 bolts of colored cloth, dyed materials, satin, printed cloth, and fine twill. Guangdong merchants from Mazhang purchased over 1,500 bolts of pongee, colored cloth, dyed materials, and printed cloth. Fujian and Quanzhou merchants purchased over thirty boxes of colored twill and colored cloth. Local wholesalers replenished their inventories with pongee, bleached cloth, and foreign yarn by over 1,000 bolts. There is still demand for autumn goods and woolens among various wholesalers, but there is selectivity. About twenty to thirty boxes of products from factories such as XXX were transacted. There was slight activity in Singapore for exports, with purchases of over 1,000 bolts of bleached cloth, colored cloth, and colored twill.</p>
<p>On July 1st, 60 bolts of piece goods were shipped to Yantai, 80 bolts to Hong Kong, 31 bolts to Guangzhou Bay, 11 bolts to Beihai, 310 bolts to Haiphong, and 140 bolts of native cloth came from Beisha on the 3rd.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Wanliding Sells Well <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the actual sales of woolens have increased, and prices have continued to rise sharply. Wanliding woolens are selling particularly well this summer, especially in sand and evergreen colors, which are very popular. Demand from Western tailors is extremely strong, and most of the inventories held by traders have been sold out. Gray and white are also in short supply, causing prices to rise sharply. Currently, the only available spot goods are inferior products from the Shin Weaving mill. First-grade Universal wool is being sold for 6.50 yuan, second-grade for 5.25 yuan, and third-grade for 4.40 yuan. British-made brands such as Changtai, Trade, Mason, and Xiankang are in high demand, and it is difficult to find them even at prices above 9 yuan. The original cost of Wanliding woolens was 3 shillings and 8 pence, which, based on the previous exchange rate of 8.25, would cost 6.30 yuan per yard. At the time, the selling price was 7.75 yuan, but now, based on the recent rate of 6.625, the cost is already 7.67 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Grains: Wheat Market Prosperous; Factories Not Accepting Exchange Drafts; Flour Market Still Needs to Develop <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The current flour market situation remains unchanged. Factories continue to offer 4.65 yuan in cash but have not accepted exchange drafts. Therefore, bulk sales are not expected to be active for the time being. However, local retail transactions have increased slightly due to slight stockpiling during the bank account closing holiday. Approximately 10,000 bags have been transacted, with a few scattered purchases from Northern and Southern merchants. It is rumored that returned goods have been sold at 5 yuan in exchange drafts, and miscellaneous brands have even been reduced, but these are not considered to be true market prices. Foreign flour trading has also been quiet. Holders believe that future supplies will be cut off and are unwilling to lower prices excessively, so they are maintaining their positions.</p>
<p>The new wheat market continues to improve. In terms of supply, besides carloads of wheat arriving daily from the Nanjing area, boatloads of wheat from Jiading are also continuing to arrive. Although the current demand from Chinese factories is weak, Japanese factories and local trading houses continue to purchase. The market is experiencing a limited supply, and trading houses are actively selling. Jiading wheat has reached 6.60 yuan, and Nanjing wheat is priced at 6.55 yuan. Over 400 bags have been transacted. Currently, production prices are firm and high, and the market is expected to continue to thrive.</p>
<p>In terms of exports, 37,000 bags of flour will be shipped to Tianjin, 1,800 bags to Xiangyu, and 13,000 bags to Quanzhou on July 1st. Additionally, 300 bags of wheat bran will be shipped to Xiangyu.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Closing Accounts and Suspending Sales for Two Days: Japonica and Indica Rice Sales Active <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>The rice market announced yesterday that due to the closing of silver houses for account settlement for three days, the rice market will also suspend sales for two days on July 1st and 2nd. Afterwards, sales will be suspended every Sunday during the summer. Local shops are preparing in advance, so sales have suddenly become active. Furthermore, supplies from various sources are scarce, with only 1,600 to 1,700 bags of Changzhou car rice arriving. Sellers are raising prices, and major buyers are also taking the opportunity to increase their holdings, causing the market to rebound. As a result, prices of both thick and thin Japonica rice have increased by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan.</p>
<p>Interior Indica: Yesterday, purchases from interior villages and Funo increased because prices had fallen for several consecutive days, and transportation costs were reasonable. Additionally, sales would be suspended for two days, so merchants rushed to make purchases, with 2,600 to 2,700 bags being sent to interior villages and over 1,000 bags being sold locally. Market prices immediately rebounded by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan, especially for white rice and Zhongguan rice. The prices of Du Yangjian and Bu Jian rice also followed suit, increasing by 0.20 yuan.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Both spot trading and new purchase contracts are quiet. However, foreign merchants continue to offer rice for sale. No. 1 Half rice is priced at 21.23 yuan, and No. 2 rice is priced at 20.034 yuan. However, grain merchants are uninterested because the price of rice shipped to Japan has fallen.</p>
<p>Glutinous Rice: Yesterday, Kui Yuan rice saw lackluster sales due to poor distribution channels and abundant foreign glutinous rice. The market atmosphere was ordinary, without significant gains or losses.</p>

<p>The momentum of crude soybean oil remains weak. Because today is Government Establishment Day and tomorrow is Sunday, there are two days of market closure, making transactions difficult. Prices have repeatedly fallen. However, the soybean oil market rebounded sharply in the afternoon due to sudden inquiries from Hankou in the Yangtze River region. The market sentiment soared, and soybean oil shipped from Kobe rose sharply from 40.60 yuan to 47 yuan, but only a small number of transactions occurred. The total market transactions were only 80 barrels. Overall, the market is constrained by the need to liquidate cash positions, but observing the underlying trend, there may be a rebound on Monday. Other transactions included 200 pieces of Yanjii soybean oil priced at 23.50 yuan, 100 pieces of Qingqi soybean oil at 32.90 yuan, 300 pieces of Jiaozhou soybean oil at 32.50 yuan, and 500 pieces of Jiaozhou peanut oil at 33 yuan.</p>
<p>In terms of exports, 100 bags of soybeans will be shipped to Xiangyu, 200 bags to Quanzhou, and 620 bags to Hong Kong. Soybean oil will be shipped to Quanzhou, and 200 catties of oilseed cakes will be shipped to Xiangyu, all on July 1st.</p>

<h3 id="e130">A Letter from Nineteen Teachers: A Desperate Plea <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Hoping investors establish consumer cooperatives and organize people's dining halls and people's dormitories</p>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>We are all middle school teachers, and most of us have a monthly income of about 70 yuan. In terms of social status and monthly salary, although we are not as good as those above, we are still better off than those below. Most of us have parents, wives, and children. Since the war, the cost of living in Shanghai has been rising day by day, and it is really difficult to cope with the living expenses of a family of four or five people with an income of about 70 yuan. Just taking rent as an example, the average rent of our nineteen people is 25.4 yuan per month. Among them, one person is a sub-landlord, and three people still live in houses rented before the war. However, this amount has swallowed up more than one-third of our total income. However, we know that this is a very special period. The country is in trouble, and it is up to us to economize. Three of us still spend 3 yuan a month to support a refugee, and everyone still works hard to shoulder the burden of the family. But even more unfortunate things followed. As soon as the horses arrived in Shanghai, when we woke up the next day, it felt like we were in another world, and prices soared. Five days later, nineteen of us held a discussion meeting to discuss how to cope with future life: after calculating, everyone stared at each other, and future life would have to increase by at least 25% compared to the past! What should we do? We are willing to go to the interior, but how can we cope with our family? (Two single people have already decided to leave.) After everyone's discussion, we came up with a way. This method is not only for us, but it can also benefit most people, so we decided to write it down and send it to "Spring and Autumn" for everyone to discuss and promote together.</p>
<p>Consumer Cooperative: We thought of establishing a consumer cooperative for daily necessities. There is no better way to benefit us than a cooperative. According to our most honest estimates, at least one-fifth, or even more than one-fifth, of our monthly income of 70 yuan is exploited by profiteers and sub-landlords. At the same time, there is also a kind of pain, that is, prices change indefinitely. If rice is expensive, we spend five more yuan to buy rice, so there is no change left, and we can't afford to buy anything else. Who knows how much blood and sweat money the rice shop profiteers have earned from us! If someone establishes a cooperative and sells rice, because it is bought in bulk, the price is cheaper. At the same time, because the cooperative is established for the benefit of its own members, it will not manipulate prices, and at most it will charge a little handling fee for the staff, then we can really get a lot of discounts. This is just one example. Consumer cooperatives can also be established for firewood, charcoal, coal, oil, salt, etc. The establishment of this kind of organization can also cultivate the spirit of mutual assistance, mutual help, honesty, and dedication, and this spirit is precisely what is most lacking on the current isolated island.</p>
<p>Naturally, the source of funds is a problem, but we can ask wealthy compatriots or the banking community to invest. Rich people feel that they have money but nowhere to spend it, and they desperately do speculative business, especially the banking community. If we have legitimate uses and ask them to invest, it is not impossible. At the same time, our members can also invest shares. Although the amount paid by each person is not much, it is an integer when collected. We feel that restricting rice prices is only a passive way, and establishing consumer cooperatives is a proactive way. We should rely on our own strength to maintain our own lives!</p>
<p>We believe that every street hall, every large company, every university, and even your newspaper, can be used as a unit to establish this consumer cooperative. As long as it is beneficial, why should we be afraid that others will not join? Why should we be afraid that it will not be successful? We don't know much about the principles of cooperatives. The above is just a brief principle, or even a desperate request. We hope that people in the middle and lower classes can consider it more, participate in discussions, this is for our own benefit!</p>
<p>In addition to this, we have two more suggestions, one is a people's dining hall, and the other is a people's dormitory.</p>
<p>People's Dining Hall and People's Dormitory: If we have a large-scale people's dining hall and people's dormitory at present, we believe that we will definitely not lose money. We hope that people with spare money will set up people's dining halls and people's dormitories, and it is best for the two concession authorities to organize it themselves. We only need cleanliness and hygiene, and we don't ask for deliciousness and comfort. If this kind of dining hall and dormitory can be widely established, it will definitely be able to thrive and increase social welfare, which is called killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>We hope that speculative merchants whose conscience has not been obliterated will do less speculation that harms people, the country, and ultimately themselves. Don't just want to earn more. Earning more will be fatal and will cause suffering to many people. It is better to use the money for legitimate social undertakings so that everyone can share his kindness!</p>
<p>The above is our urgent appeal. The problem of people's livelihood in Shanghai is becoming more and more serious. This should be resolved immediately. Many people have become criminals of the country and nation due to the oppression of life. Many people are being forced to do illegal activities of robbery and plunder due to the oppression of life, and even more people are struggling hopelessly. Editor, are you willing to publish this letter of ours? If it can arouse a discussion and promote the attention of social figures and responsible authorities, and then start to establish and implement it, wouldn't it be of great help to the people, society, and even the country? Specially, I respectfully extend my greetings!</p>
<p>From Nineteen People</p>
<h3 id="e131">"Little Princess" Impressions <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>“Little Princess” A Twentieth Century Fox Production</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an "isolated island," bizarre phenomena have occurred in the sacred field of education, and these trends are continuing to worsen. This undesirable situation naturally arose with the war. However, for the education sector, which bears a significant mission, to compete with unscrupulous merchants who manipulate rice prices and raise rents is truly the greatest loss during the war.</p>
<p>Consider the many large, medium, and small schools that have relocated to the rear areas. They are unafraid of air raids; they build their own houses; and, in addition to studying, they actively participate in work in the rear. Each school and each student has become a powerful unit in the war of resistance. Shanghai's education sector should echo the rear areas. At the very least, it should educate for the sake of education. The cry of "Save the students!" should not fall on deaf ears.</p>
<p>Although the story of "Little Princess" revolves around the joys and sorrows of Shirley Temple and her father, it powerfully criticizes the corruption in education and the principal's use of the school as a tool for making money. For instance, because Shirley Temple is the daughter of an army captain, she receives preferential treatment upon entering the school. However, when the news of the captain's death arrives, the principal immediately reveals her snobbish face and throws Shirley Temple into the kitchen.</p>
<p>At the same time, we have seen orders to give special treatment to the families of soldiers. However, it must be solemnly stated that comparing the current situation in China with "Little Princess" is like missing by a hair and being off by a thousand miles because the British army's ordered expedition and China's war of resistance are inversely proportional. Nevertheless, this story can serve as a stark reminder to the "isolated island" education sector: many lives have been sacrificed for the country. What is your responsibility?</p>
<p>Shirley Temple fully displays her acting skills in this play. Especially in the two scenes of parting with her father and finally meeting him again, she can control the emotions of the tragedy, gradually building from faint to intense, reaching a climax. In the entire play, she also sweeps away the "accumulated habits" of the past and restores the innocence and liveliness of a child.</p>
<p>The director's achievements can be divided into the following four points: (1) In depicting Shirley Temple's transition from preferential treatment to servitude, he uses contrast: for example, when she arrives, the principal leads her to a magnificent room and forces another girl to leave so that Shirley can sit next to her; upon learning of the captain's death, the principal immediately disperses the companions celebrating Shirley's birthday, moves her to a small building, and punishes her with servitude. This not only strengthens the audience's sympathy for Shirley but also exposes the principal's snobbery. (2) In the two scenes of Shirley and her father parting and finally meeting, in the former, he uses Shirley suddenly running back from the window to hug the captain, and when he leaves, Shirley faces the window and only hears the sound of the door closing and the sound of horses' hooves. In the latter, Shirley misses her father twice and then suddenly meets him. The director has grasped the emotional atmosphere very firmly. (3) Shirley's dream is indeed a venting of the weak, but it can connect the Indian servant and Shirley Temple. There is reason for this. The union of the insulted and the injured is the most powerful group. (4) Because Shirley Temple can sing and dance, two short song and dance segments are inserted here, but they are all appropriate, especially when Shirley cannot find her father in the wounded soldier hospital.</p>

<h3 id="e132">Female Storytellers <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>Biographies of Female Storytellers (1)</p>
<p>Note: The earliest verifiable records of female storytellers can be found in Yunxian Bujisheng's "Record of Surnames of Lyric Talents." This book was completed around the fifth year of the Guangxu reign (1879) and published by the Shenbao Publishing House. Cai Erkan, the historian of melancholy, stated in "Supplement to the Shenbao Publishing House Catalog" (1879) regarding its content:</p>
<p>"This record specifically collects and records the surnames of female storytellers in Shanghai and includes poems, lyrics, and commentaries recorded over the years, which are categorized below. Since the opening of ports by sea, Shanghai's trade has flourished, surpassing all others in the world, and the realm of beauty and elegance is unparalleled. Among them are so-called writing rooms, long threes, and small twos, which are all types of prostitutes. The writing rooms consider themselves slightly superior, despising everything else. Therefore, refined gentlemen still enjoy talking about them...."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, although this book is mentioned in the "Supplement," it has not been found. According to the Master of the Wanqingxiang Liumengshi Studio's "Record of Dreams South of the Song," this book seems never to have been published. Volume Three of "Record of Dreams" states: "The 'Record of Surnames of Lyric Talents' by Zhu Zimei only describes brothels and has not been printed, making it difficult to pass down for long." The "Record of Dreams" was completed in the ninth year of the Guangxu reign (1883), four years after the "Supplement," so its statement is credible. Apart from the "Record of Surnames," there are no other books specifically recording female storytellers. Therefore, it is very difficult to investigate all the figures of female storytellers at that time today.</p>
<p>Wang Tao's "Ying Ruan Miscellany" (1874), Volume Five, contains a brief description of female storytellers at the time, which can be said to be the earliest available document about female storytellers and their characters today.</p>
<p>Its text says:</p>
<p>Pinghua (plain talk) began with Liu Jingting, but it was all done by men. In recent times, Cao Chunjiang and Ma Rufei are outstanding examples. Since the Daoguang and Xianfeng reigns, women have been admired for their beautiful voices and appearances, delicate flutes, and slender strings, capable of captivating listeners. In the past, they mostly performed in the Land God temples and Luo God temples in the city. At midday and early evening, they provided entertainment. Xu Yue'e and Wang Xueqing were famous for their beauty. After the war, they all moved outside the city. The best among them were Yuan Yunxian, Wu Suqing, Zhu Youxiang, Yu Cuie, Wu Liqin, all excellent. Those who have emerged since then include Zhu Liqing, Lu Cenxian, Chen Zhixiang, Jin Yuzhen, and Zhang Cuixia, whose language is elegant and surpasses their predecessors. Every time they appear on stage, the audience is captivated. Their voices are like a hundred warbling spring orioles, intoxicating and captivating the soul. When the song ends and the person leaves, one still feels the lingering sound around the marker. This is another new realm in the world of women. Someone composed a verse to give to them: "Jade desk leisurely chants new poems, golden house cannot hide the unwritten stele," is this still not the elegance of the boudoir? As for blind female storytellers, they are not accepted. With the loss of both eyes, they still sell their talent, which is a transformed image of hell.</p>
<p>Although the so-called "blind women" here were "not accepted" by Wang Tao, they were actually the main body of "female storytellers" before the Qianlong era. Historically, female storytelling started before the Qianlong era, especially when they lived in groups and became a "regular profession" after the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras. Li Jiarui's "On Storytelling" examined this and said:</p>
<p>From ancient times, those who have made a profession of storytelling have mostly been women. This trend already existed in the Ming Dynasty. The "Three Customs and Ten Faults" records that among the beggars in Changshu, there was a "grass head woman" who loved to play the flute, drums, and zither, was skilled in gambling, could compose poetry, was familiar with the Twenty-One Histories, and was proficient in storytelling. In the early Qing Dynasty, there was a Kunqu opera called "Female Storyteller," which narrated the story of a female storyteller. This must have been preceded by the popularity of female storytellers before such a story could be created.</p>

<p>In the southern part of Japan, military activity is rampant, causing the court to be anxious. The reason is that the gentlemen and people of the country have accumulated hatred with the country of Goryeo (Korea), and they request that the state send troops to punish them in order to quell the anger. The court fears that once military action is taken, it will be difficult to stop, and does not want to act lightly. The rebellious people are taking the opportunity to stir up trouble. What is worrying is that the rebels also have soldiers among their supporters. According to telegrams transmitted on Saturday, the rebels are leading a large army to Nagasaki, which is only twenty miles away. The Westerners residing in that port are all alarmed and are preparing to move. Officials such as consuls are also moving all their belongings into military ships because the rebels also hate Westerners. A British warship stationed in Shanghai has set sail and sped to Nagasaki. Later, those in Nagasaki who harbored secret intentions and acted as internal support were suppressed by local officials, and twenty-nine people were captured and immediately beheaded, so they have not yet reached the city.</p>

<p>The area of northern Shanghai originally belonged to graveyards. Since opening up to trade, it has been leased to foreign merchants, and it has gradually transformed from hills and huts to a prosperity that surpasses all others in the world. Not only is it difficult for various provinces and counties to catch up quickly, but also no other ports can compare. The sales of opium are calculated in the hundreds of millions every day. Even calculating the lamp oil in the opium dens, it requires fifteen baskets a day, each basket containing 360 catties, totaling 5,400 catties. And this does not include foreign candles, kerosene, and matches. Furthermore, considering watermelon seeds, the daily sales in tea houses, restaurants, brothels, and opium dens reach more than thirty stones (a unit of dry measure). During the first month of the year, sales reach as high as fifty stones. Who would have expected this? In addition, there is the practice of drinking with prostitutes, watching operas in carriages, and the numerous odd and useless items sold in the markets, with daily sales exceeding millions. The rumor that Shanghai is a pit of consumption is indeed true. Looking back at the past, one feels the vicissitudes of the world even more!</p>

<p>— Gu Lanjun</p>
<p>Writing about the experiences and feelings of working in the industry</p>
<p>In the minds of ordinary people, the filming life of movie actors is probably considered very pleasant and the most carefree. Some movie fans even harbor ardent wishes, yearning to make it their sole object in life. True, you only need to follow the director's instructions and act out certain actions and expressions. Isn't that easy? In reality, this is just a superficial observation without knowing the joys and sorrows involved. The actual situation is a very difficult job that is hard to put into words.</p>
<p>I started working in the film industry at the age of fifteen, and it has been almost seven years now. In these nearly seven years, I have acted in many films and experienced many tastes of sweetness, sourness, bitterness, and spiciness. In short, the sweet component is indeed extremely small, while the bitter taste comes too often.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to write briefly about some of these filming experiences and feelings. But I also feel that this writing is even more difficult than filming because I rarely write and have never dared to try lightly. Fortunately, even if I have to revise it repeatedly, it is much easier than filming many NG shots on the set!</p>
<p>The film set is like a big opera cabinet, and working on the film set is really troublesome, especially in this scorching summer heat. This place is like a huge iron cabinet. To isolate external noise and avoid interfering with the sound recording work, the periphery of the set is built as strong and thick as steel walls and iron walls, and soundproofing boards are added, and many blankets are hung to reduce reverberation and echo. Before the director's command to "Camera!" is shouted, all the doors in and out are closed tightly to prevent ventilation, and the lights above, below, left, and right emit extremely strong light, all focused on the actors, intensely illuminating them. "Try it once," "Try it again." After repeated practice under the director's command, formal filming can begin. Working all night in such a hot and unbearable situation, the sweat beads on the body pour down like rain, and the light burns and hurts the skin. Only oneself knows and cannot tell this suffering. As for the viewing on the screen, on average, after working hard all night, the result that can be shown to the audience is probably less than twenty minutes!</p>
<p>A few days ago, my older sister, Meijun, bought a light gray handbag. My sisters and I were filming "Lan Lan's Flying Corpse." She took this handbag to the film set. Who knew that in less than two days, it was completely disfigured by the light, and the original light gray color quickly turned into a light red hue. When my older sister Meijun made this surprising discovery, she rushed to show it to me and expressed deep regret. I couldn't help but feel a sense of sorrow that "even objects are like this," and I was almost in a daze and almost shed tears.</p>

<p>Our entire group also had a girl sent to be our guide. When we acted alone, or when we had difficulty buying things due to language barriers, often among the passers-by, a Russian who spoke Chinese well would step out. He would act as a volunteer translator to solve our difficulties. Who was he? How could we encounter such a coincidence?</p>
<p>Once, I was shopping in a store. A female clerk pointed to the gold ring I was wearing and asked me in fluent English: "What is this? What is it for?" I replied: "This is my wedding ring, in memory of my wife." Unexpectedly, she asked me: "Please discard it immediately!" I asked her in surprise: "What is the reason?" She said: "The love between a man and a woman is 'natural' and 'pure.' The union of two hearts only requires mutual affection. To think that at the beginning of a marriage, one must rely on this dirty gold as a connection for the love between two people is already unnatural and impure! Moreover, it already implies a sign of rupture in advance, so I advise you to discard it!" After hearing this little clerk's remarks, I felt that they were quite insightful. Unfortunately, I still failed to part with the ring and discard it! It wasn't because I was stingy and reluctant to give up this mere gold, because this ring was not a memorial to my marriage, but a souvenir brought to me from Paris, France, by my first lover. Although she has already left and has a husband, I see her in my mind and always wear it on my finger, until the time I write this article.</p>
<p>Soviet girls possess both a healthy physique and a sincere passion. When Mr. Mei performed on stage, women in the audience often shouted, "Mei Lanfang! I love you!" (This has also happened in the United States.) Especially on the last night of the public performance at the Moscow National Academy, after the play ended, the audience refused to leave their seats, and the curtain rose and fell more than ten times. After a girl shouted, "Mei Lanfang, I love you!" she presented a bouquet of flowers on stage to Mr. Mei. Who was she? She was the daughter of Litvinov, the Soviet Foreign Minister who had recently been dismissed.</p>
<p>After our performance in Moscow, we went to Leningrad for a public performance, which ended on the morning of April 12. We returned to Moscow to board the train back to China, but the experience of the Soviet National Theatre Bolshoi Theatre suddenly requested: Be sure to give a final performance at the National Theatre. It is said that it was because some senior government officials wanted to see the magic of Chinese opera.</p>

<p>— Lianlu</p>
<p>The Pu Yu Society's male and female storytellers, who have been absent for a long time, will be performing day and night at the Zhongnan Storytelling Theater again starting on July 4. What good news this is for Shanghai storytelling fans! Speaking of the Pu Yu Society, we cannot help but think of the Zhongnan Storytelling Theater, which has a historical connection with the society. The Pu Yu Society has its current status, on the one hand, it is certainly due to the efforts of the members to cater to the needs of the audience, and on the other hand, it can also be said that it was because of the support of the theater in the past that they were able to succeed today.</p>
<p>This time, the performance time of the Pu Yu Society at the Zhongnan Storytelling Theater is 2:30 p.m. for the day performance and 8:15 p.m. to 11:15 p.m. for the night performance. At the same time, the theater manager, Mr. Li Wencai, has requested the opening piece writer, Mr. Ni Gaofeng, to perform his new work, "Duet Opening Piece," at the theater successively. The thousands of listeners who have heard Mr. Ni's opening pieces such as "Farewell My Concubine" and "Lady Sun's Sacrifice to the River"... on this day, I think there will be an even bigger sensation. As for the performers, there are Chen Rong: Wang Jiayu, Wang Lanyun, Wang Meiyun, "Gold-Plated Phoenix," Zhou Juxian "Double Continuous Evasion," He Yunfang, He Qinfang, "Double Pearl Ball," Chen Yaxian, Chen Meixian, "Mao Family Book," Xie Letian, Xie Xiaotian, Xie Fengtian, "Jade Dragonfly," "White Snake Legend." The seat price is popular, only selling for one and a half corners, and it also includes fragrant tea.</p>
<p>Today's manuscript is crowded, "Outside Records of the Pear Garden" will be suspended for one day, and will be continued in the next issue.</p>

<p>Not meaning to beat a dead horse, mentioning "comedy," one cannot help but think of Wang Wu Neng and the feeling of "the dead are gone, who will follow?" He is broad in the stomach, has many plays, is familiar with dialects from all over the place, and singing comedy is like driving a light car on a familiar road.</p>
<p>Although the way of "comedy" is small, there are also "skills" in it, and it cannot be said that "indiscriminately releasing low-level gags" is the extent of its ability!</p>

<p>After the Tianjin incident, which caused a great uproar, many people fled from there to Shanghai. The person mentioned in this article also sent a letter to her companions yesterday, saying that she would be back soon. In fact, although the British and French concessions in Tianjin have been blockaded, as for whether Shanghai is safe, I am afraid it is only a difference of fifty steps compared to a hundred. Why does she need to come back? However, (29) that is not the case. According to her letter, she was a dance partner at a Xianle Dance Hall in Tianjin. Now that the dance hall has been closed, without saying, her dance ticket income is gone. Besides, her parents are now in Shanghai, so even if the Tianjin concession is not blockaded, she should come back. Then again, if the Tianjin concession were not blockaded, the Xianle Dance Hall would not have closed down. So her return can also be regarded as affected by the Tianjin incident.</p>
<p>She is a sixteen-year-old girl, and she is quite tall. She has a round face, like the Mid-Autumn Festival moon, a pair of black and bright eyes, like two stars, a very straight nose, a mouth that is neither too big nor too small, and teeth like shattered jade. When she speaks, she reveals two shallow dimples. Her breasts are well-developed, and her muscles are also very strong. Although her skin is not very delicate, overall, she can be called healthy and beautiful. I think this is very much to the liking of northerners. She usually doesn't talk much, and when she sees strangers, she doesn't say a word. Some people say that she is innocent, but unfortunately, she lacks liveliness. Don't say that. If you are familiar with her, she will also talk and laugh like everyone else, and her liveliness will be great. She used to be a dance partner at the Metropolis for a long time, sitting opposite Li Mingzhu. Whether she will go to the dance hall again this time, which dance hall she will go to, we will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>When she was going to Tianjin, a companion wanted to give her a farewell party and pulled me to be the escort. Needless to say, the escort was a formality, and the real thing was to collect money. Coincidentally, a friend wanted to invite me to dinner that day, so I explained the farewell party to him and dipped some tea on the table with my finger and wrote "Willing" and "Unwilling" in two lines. I said, if you are willing to treat, then erase "Unwilling." If you are unwilling, then erase "Willing." He said, "You are really something. You are committing a play from the dancing hall. Since you are going to He Yupai, why should I temporarily play Zhang Jinfeng? But today, the male becomes female, and the female becomes male." Saying that, he casually wiped away the word "Un" and it became "Willing" "Willing." I said, why do you need two "Willing"? He said, "In principle, you need four "Willing." Peishan has someone to give her a farewell party, of course, she is "Willing." Her companion has you doing errands for her, naturally she is also "Willing." As for you, you found this scapegoat, and you occupy two spots in face. Needless to mention Miss Geng, of course, she is "Willing." As for me, usually buying a dance ticket of ten or twenty yuan and inviting them to have dinner with me, I may not be able to invite them. Today, I don't spend a penny, and after they finish eating, they have to thank me, wouldn't that be even more "Willing"? But it's too cheap for you." After dinner, we sent Ye Peishan home, upstairs in a newly opened paper shop, the place is small, the people are noisy, and the weather is so hot, young girl, how can you live here?</p>
