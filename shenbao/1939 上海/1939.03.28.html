<h3>蘇日漁業談判的敎訓</h3>
<p>蘇日兩國的漁業談判，自去年十月間，由日本駐蘇大使東鄉與李維諾夫進行談判，遷延已近半年，會晤無慮數十决，始終沒有結果。按蘇日兩國漁業爭執的地帶，是在蘇聯領海日本海白林海鄂霍次克海一帶的漁業區。依照一九〇五年日俄戰後的樸資茅斯條的中，帝俄允許日本得在沿海上述地點捕漁。這是日本口口聲聲所謂「條的」權利的來源，也是日本所謂願以國運賭博漁權的唯一根據。三十年來，日本藉口於條的規定，隨時乘機發展其野心。當蘇聯十月革命的時候，日本就曾經把北海漁區用武力佔據過來的。其後是項侵佔的漁區雖為蘇聯奪回，但日本的侵漁事實差不多是每年發生的。</p>
<p>蘇日的漁業協定的初步成立是在一九〇五年，一九二八年加以補充，到了一九三六年業已期滿。到期之前，日本就要求續行修訂，結果蘇聯准予延期一年，暫時允許日本得在規定的三百數十區漁塲捕漁，並得不受蘇聯的標賣辦法的拘束。到了去年年底，已到了再决延期屆滿的日子，日本當然還希望蘇聯再予繼續，可是蘇聯在最近，不但看穿了日本貪得無厭的野心，同時發覺日本利用了上述漁塲的便利，在蘇聯領海內，有妨害蘇聯國防的舉動，因此堅決主張收回有關國防的漁塲四十餘區。同時，鑒於日本對於中東路欠欵的愆期，並以日本償還六百萬元的中東路欠欵為先決條件。</p>
<p>從去年開始談判以來，日本當局雖一再發布恐嚇性的談話，蘇聯堅持原來的主張，不為動搖。到了本月十五日，在雙方談判停頓中，蘇聯且毅然把三百數十處漁塲實行標賣，其中四處業已拍賣，均為蘇聯商人所得。並決定在四月三日舉行二决拍賣。在初决拍賣消息傳出之後，日本外相有田，曾發表談話，表示日本沒有參加此項標賣，對於此决標賣的四區漁塲中，如果牽涉及日本利益，不能承認，並聲明蘇聯應該負此事件所生的責任。但是全世界輿論界都認為日本此種主張，純然是一種虛張聲勢而已，在對華戰爭二十個月的今日，日本已沒有方法維持現局，那裏還敢向休養生息二十年的蘇聯挑戰呢！</p>
<p>果然，在有田談話之後二日，因為蘇聯方面不為所動，就接着發表談話，表示日本願意自動參加第二决漁塲的標賣，今日本報電訉中，且報道兩國談判的結束，或者不遠。我們雖沒有知道日本此决參加標賣的內容，但是由於日本的內餒，則此次必由日本的屈服，已經是很明顯的事實了。</p>
<p>在此一事實的經過，實在使抗戰中的中國，得到重大的敎訓。第一，日本的屈服，是表示中國的抗戰，確實已把日本實力消鑠得外强中乾，只要中國能夠繼續抗戰，勝利的日期就在眼前了。第二，日本對蘇的屈服，是表示惟有嚴正與强硬的外交政策，才是侵略者唯一的當頭棒擊。因此，要摧敗日本，要安定遠東秩序，在中國是堅決的抗戰，各國是用切實有效的制裁方法！</p>

<p>（巴黎）義相墨索里尼所發表之演說、頃由此間負責人士加以評論、僉謂義法兩國之爭、茲已正式成為外交問題、義國所提出之要求、亦以直布底港·都尼西亞保護地·蘇彝士運河、三者為限、但是吾屬于領土性質、尙未可必、此層一日不能明瞭、則法義兩國是吾有進行談判之可能、即一日無從斷定，此外、各報均謂法國從未拒絕與義國進行談判、特在領土上決不願有所讓步、時報載稱、「國際間不論舉行何種談判、法國從未拒絕參加、但某某國所提要求、竟欲侵犯法蘭西殖民帝國主權與領土完整、允其是關於都尼西亞保護地之要求、則法國必答之曰吾、巴黎晚報載稱、「法從未拒絕與任何人進行談判、但決不聽仟尺土寸地為人攘奪」云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）義相墨索里尼昨日所發表之演說、此間各報原以為措詞必甚切實、面具有挑　性質、茲見其平穩如此、亦即不甚引為焦慮、日報載稱、「義相演詞若于段、雖由聽衆發出表示、加以贊同但其所言幷未火上加汕、反以保存和平自期、該報又據拍林訪員來電稱、義相對于德國兼併捷克收回米美爾區之舉幷無道賀之語、德人對於此層、佯作不甚關切、「其對於墨索里尼所謂義國在亞德里亞海沿岸保有優越利益一節、亦避不言及之、」小巴黎人報載稱、「法國對於義國無所要求、義國政府倘認為法義兩國有進行談判之可能、曷不以其願望、通吿法國駐義大使龐賽、」右派斐伽洛報載稱、「義國旣有所求、苟欲明瞭法國政府意見、自應經由外交正常途徑以求之」、時代報載稱、「德國力量大增之後義相墨索里尼當已感覺德國終有一日、必向亞德里亞海推進、特渠受外長齊亞諾法西斯黨秘書長史達拉斯之慫恿、一至于是、恐亦鮮能自拔、」急進社會黨事業報載稱、「義相墨索里尼所望于吾人者、未知何事、亦未知能吾予以接受、加以討論、或認為不可容忍、或謂義相代言人蓋達、業巳有所表示、其奈法國政府不能與蓋達輩談判何、」社會黨人民報載稱、羅索里尼洵為希特勒之及門弟子、其摹仿希特勒也、可謂無微不至、茶至向羣衆發言方式、亦以希特勒為法、吾人若欲在其演詞中探知何項詳細情形、或探知其意圖所在、實屬徒勞無益、惟是義相代言人蓋達已于義相發言之日、在義大利人民報發表一文、謂法國境內尙有日耳曼人三百五十萬人、弦外之音、可以見矣一云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）今日各報載官塲授意之文、略謂、義國今已以其政治領袖之言論、說明其對都尼斯·吉布蒂·與蘇彝士歷史上權利之要求、而解決爭端之問題、今乃公開、不能再有置之不答之可能矣云（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）關於義相　案里尼·昨日在羅馬所發表之演說、柏林政界人士認為、又係廓淸德義軸心政策之重要貢獻、因之表示完全贊許，關於學氏提出、突尼斯·吉勃蒂·蘇彝士三點、柏林認為、墨氏於此已表示其願意談判之意念、今後如何、當視法國之答覆為斷、今日報章亦咸著文評論墨氏演說、「柏林地方日報申稱、墨氏上次在熱內亞發表演說中所提及法義兩國間之障碍、現因西班牙局勢之轉變、已經消除、特此種裂痕、尙未完全平復耳、（二十七日海通社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）義相學索里尼日昨發表演說之後、英國各報頃加以評論、一致認為有與法國進行談判之意、至法國與之談判是吾有利一層，則各報所見不同、泰晤士報載有羅馬訪員來電稱一義相演詞雖以羅馬柏林軸心為言、但已為法義兩國造成息爭之機會、法國倘能以合理的讓步給予義國、則墨索里尼即準備且深願與法國為友、但仍不忘情于義德兩國之聯繫、」該報外交記者則謂、「英國政府現正縝密研究義相演詞、一般人初步印象、或謂歐洲時局幷未因而愈益緊張」云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英是否行徵兵制　意見仍甚紛歧　張伯倫一再接見反對派要求合作充實國防計畫</h3>
<p>（倫敦）張伯倫首相於本日午前在道寗街十號、接見反對派工黨領袖格林伍德、相與進行談話、政界人士聞悉之後、均極注意、僉謂一星期以來、政府與反對派工黨、屢决交換意見、其用意乃欲勸請各黨與政府合作、俾充實國防計劃、得以加緊推進、其事仍將由張伯倫首相主持、而由反對派參加其間、故非改組內閣之謂、此外、張伯倫首相曾於數閱月前、在下議院宣稱、承平時代、決不實施徵兵制、茲或要求下議院、准其於必要時、收回前言、果爾、則軍事性質之義務服役制、或先實行之於國內、亦未可必云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於實施徵兵制問題、此問半官方面頃由官方授意、發表文吿、聲明政府無意採取徵兵制、亦不擬實施國民義務登記辦法、其言略調、義相墨索里尼今晨發表演說之後、國際時局匪特幷未惡化、反已趨於緩和、國際間他日若果發生重大變化、意外事變因而有立即爆發之處時、政府或將實施徵兵制問題、從新加以考慮、屆時甚或邀請反對派各黨參加國民內閣、亦未可必、但以目前情形而論、此種擬議、距離實現之期尙遠、政府派各黨議員、對於實施微兵制之議、大多表示反對、保守黨多數黨員、某日舉行集會時、雖就推行「義務訓練辦法」、加以考慮、幷認為此項辦法實與徵兵制不同、但在討論辦法內容時、各方意見未能趨於一致、要而言之、各大陸國因在陸地與他國毘連之故、不得不保有大量陸軍此在吾國則情形原有不同其所當注意者、厥乃他日發生意外事變時、或當會同他國、出以共同行動、似此吾若澈首澈尾不施行微兵制而欲履行所負義務是吾有其可能、殊屬疑問云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間消息靈通人士頃宜稱、實施徵兵制問題、仍為內閣最關心之事、各閣員見解並不一致、哈里法克斯外相完全表示贊同、且已在某種程度之內、徵得張伯倫首相同意、特霍爾內相西門財相堅決加以反對、咸謂政府若延長兵後期限、或實施徵兵制、而欲　總選舉時獲得勝利、乃從來米見之事、此在帝國國防委員會、聞贊成設立一種義務服役制但與徵兵制度有別至反對派工黨對於各種義務服役制、不問其形式若何、均所反對、最低限度亦不願在張伯倫首相領導之下、予以實施、要之、本問題如何決定、當以戰事危機之消長為轉移云（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據路透社國會訪員聲稱、某數報及他處所傳、首相張伯倫或將辭職、實毫無根據、據稱、內閣分裂之傳說、大的係因實施微兵制問題而起、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>蘇格蘭斯德林　反對派工黨下議員莊思敦、曾任掌璽大臣之職、頃在此間發表演說、對於微兵制表示反對之意、略謂、國民應徵入伍、自應知其原因何在、凡屬吾黨黨員、決不為帝國全義作戰、義法兩國若因直布底港而發生衝突、吾黨亦即不願牽入漩渦、茲為誘令墨索里尼與德國分離計、蘇彝士運河與直布羅陀港、允宜使其國際化云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>杜白林　愛爾蘭共和邦行政院主席凡勒拉昨自瑞士國返國、道出倫敦、曾在近郊迄葛斯鎭、與張伯倫首相商談歐洲時局、此事頗為共和邦政界人士所重視、咸以歐洲發生戰事時、共和邦態度若何為問、關於此層、衆議院近頃討論國防問題時、反對派愛爾蘭統一黨內部、即已發現兩種不同之意見、一部份主張嚴守中立、一部份則　為中立不可能、議論紛紜、未易決定、此在消息靈通人士則謂、共和邦在歐洲未來戰事中、態度若何、對於英國關係重要、自可乘機向之從新提出南北愛爾蘭統一問題、北愛爾蘭財政部畏安德魯斯、近作倫敦之遊、聞會就北愛爾蘭所可應允讓步之事、通吿英國政府、藉以便利解決方案之成立云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>格林斯貝　前任外相艾登、頃於本日午後、在此間發表演說、主張各黨應立即組成舉國一致內閣、聯合歐洲愛好和平各國、以遏止德國元首希特勒之盲進、其言有曰、「時至此日、吾人唯有團結與努力而已、吾人已不能再虛擲一小時之光陰必須積極努力、俾全世界均知英國業巳覺悟、其態度且甚懇摯、各政黨問、必須立即休戰、幷依據最廣大之基礎、組成新內閣、以對外而論、哈里法克斯外相曾於本月二士日發出表示、願聯合歐洲愛好和平各國、以抵抗德國未來侵略、余意政府須當加緊推行此項政策、倘能代表全國各黨發言、必更有成功之望、余深信之、以對內而論、政府務當在工業資源上人力上、立即採取必要措置、俾能於最短期間內、在軍事上完成最大限度之努力、要之、對內對外政府倘能推行此種政策、必能促成全國團結、毫無疑義」云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>新四軍一年來　抗戰經驗與敎訓</h3>
<p>— 項英</p>
<p>本軍抗戰經過</p>
<p>新四軍的成立時間很短，眞是在抗戰中產生出來的，這是與其他軍隊不同的。可以說本軍的成立一直到今天，經過了四個階段。</p>
<p>第一階段：改編。我們軍隊的前身是散佈在南方的江西，湖南，福建，廣東，浙江，安徽，湖北等這些省分的紅色游擊隊與紅軍改編而成的。自從七，七，八，一三，事變以來，南方各省的紅軍，及紅色游擊隊為了保衛中華民國，為了爭取中華民族的解放，在民國二十六年十月二日，奉軍事委員會命令改編為國民革命軍陸軍新編第叫軍。實際上我們部隊改編為新四軍是在二十七年一月間開始的，也可以說在二十七年才正式進行正式完成的。雖然我們部隊散佈在南方七八省地區，有很遼遠的範圍，很多的單位，但能在這一命令和中國共產黨決定下面，一致的把部隊改編完成。從二十七年一月到二月中是本軍改編的時期。</p>
<p>第二階段：集中。改編後一月，奉蔣委員長命令新編第叫軍分兩地集中，江北向ＸＸ集中，江南向ＸＸ集中，二月十日以後，是第二階段的開始，改編了的部隊依着指定地區集中，首先是第一支隊二月十日由各駐地向前開動，接着第二支隊和第三支隊繼續開進，江北也陸續的向ＸＸ地區集中，我們的軍部是四月十日自南昌向皖南移動，雖然我們極大多數部隊相距有二千多里，而且最大部分是徒步行軍，但終於在四月十日集中完成。集中完舉以後，戰區司令長官派員到ＸＸ點騐集中部隊。自二月十日至叫月十日是第二個階段。</p>
<p>第三階段：部隊的開進與展開。常着我們部隊集中完畢的時候，又奉着司令長官的命令，要我們迅速的開進，開到作戰地區進行戰鬥，這是叫月十五日的命令，我記得在侖令上給我們的任務是要我們到指定地區構成游擊網，襲擊敵人，破壞敵人的交通，並在指定的地區構築游擊根據地。</p>
<p>等着我們部隊檢騐完畢，於四月二十八日開始向指定地區與作戰地區前進。這是本軍先遣隊向前開進的日子，這先遣隊是我們在江南的部隊抽出一部份組織的，它的任務是要了解與偵察前進的路綫與作戰的情況，以便於部隊的開進。先遣隊出發以後，接着主力部隊陸續跟進，隨着先遣隊開入江南作戰地區，同時我們司令部亦於五月間移至南段，指揮全軍作戰。由四月二十日起，一直至五月，一方面是我們部隊開進，一方面是開入作戰地區以後，進行作戰。這是本軍抗戰的第三階段。</p>
<p>第四階段：作戰，我們的部隊前進到作戰地區與正式展開以後，便正　作戰。（Ａ）第一，江北部隊到達指定作戰地區之時（五月十六日）正是敵人向合肥進攻，企圖在巢湖東岸渡過西岸，在蔣家河口上開始本軍第一次的戰鬥，戰鬥結果把巢湖登陸敵人，完全擊潰，他們繳獲了十一支槍，一面日軍旗子，這是本軍在江北第一次作戰的勝利。（Ｂ）第二，江南六月十八日在鎭江以南衛崗地方開始江南第一次戰鬥，也可說是江南第一决的勝利，這次是截擊由鎭江南下的汽車，除了逃脫一輛以外，全部都被擊燬，並擊斃了日本土井少佐一名，和梅崗武郎大尉一名，繳獲了長短槍十枝，以及其他軍用品，還有七千多元日金，這是江南第一次戰鬥的勝利，自從江北五月十六，江南六月十八以後，開始進行戰鬥，由此江南，江北進行了最激烈的戰鬥。這種戰鬥是根據司令長官給我們的任務，由戰鬥達到任務的完成，而這種戰鬥任務，還是游擊戰的任務。一直到九月底，我們又接着司令長官的命令，要我們部隊接受靑弋江友軍陣地，十月七日一個支隊到靑弋江沿河一帶，接受陣地，這就是本軍開始担負了局部的陣地戰。在這一階段上說大部份是游擊戰小部份是陣地戰。按照軍隊的火力來講，本軍火力很弱，沒有强有力的火力，是不能够祖任陣地戰進行陣地戰的。但為了抗戰的需要，為了便利在同一戰錢上友軍的作戰，不得不勉力接受這個任務，並且完成了這個任務。有人說八路軍新叫軍不打陣地戰的，他們是拒絕陣地戰的，講這些話的人，他們是不了解或者誤解，我們可以說我們火力比任何軍隊差，火力弱的軍隊，是不能祖任陣地戰，是不能完成陣地戰任務的，但是我們為了抗戰，只要對抗戰有利，雖然在犧牲更大的任務下面，我們是要接受這個任務，並且努力去完成這個任務的。</p>
<p>這是說明本軍抗戰的四個階段，第一個階段改編，第二個階段集中，第三個階段開進與展開，第四個階段作戰。這四個階段是本軍民國二十七年一年的經過。（未完）</p>

<h3>十四世達賴喇嘛　由金瓶抽籤產生</h3>
<p>預定今年冬季舉行</p>
<p>由吳忠信熱振主持</p>
<p>車慶航訊、從邊疆傅來的消息、第十三世達賴喇嘛自從民國廿二年十二月十七日圓寂後、他的轉身業已找到、第十四世達賴喇嘛、即將產生出來了、記者特走訪蒙藏委員會、西藏辦事處以及在渝藏人、盡一日之奔定、獲得了一大串富有興趣的新聞、</p>
<p>據說、這次達賴轉身的發現地點、是在青海、如何發現的呢、即是依據觀海時所乞得的靈異的指示、這種觀海典禮、是在拉　附近的騰格里海舉行的、由　攝藏政的熱振呼圖克圖主持舉行的時候、海面會發生一種類似海市蜃樓的现象、就是</p>
<p>靈異　從這現象測出來的、但這種現象、並非觀海一次、即可獲得、自達賴圓寂後、會由熱振呼圖克圖舉行了幾白回，最後、始於二十五年冬季獲得結果、這次所顯出者，隱隱約約有青海字樣、於是断定未來的達賴喇嘛、定在青海．經年餘之尋覓、達賴轉世者、遂於去年秋季在青海西甯的地方被人找到、而且生期與達賴死期同時、完全符合西藏教規、在西藏生期與達賴的死期同時、也是備定為達賴轉世的一個必要條件、</p>
<p>但據另一方面消息、前年春季之拉薩東北漢人地、也找到了雨個被認為達賴問世的、依照西藏的教規、除觀海外、達賴喇嘛的遺言，也可作為尋覓達賴轉世的根據、例如達賴圓寂時、遺言將轉世於何處、後來在那個地方找到的生期與達賴死期同時的、便得被認為達賴轉世、據說、在拉薩找到的、即是以此為依據的、</p>
<p>截至現在達賴的轉世、總共找到三位、大約不會再有新的發現了、至於在這幾個中、如何確定那一位是真的達賴轉世呢、則將舉行一</p>
<p>隆重的抽籤</p>
<p>典禮、來決定他、此項典禮、係根據前清乾隆五十七年（一七五二）藏人所制定的金瓶抽籤定律而舉、據聞過去喇嘛之衣缽傅受、一向由「吹忠」（即喇嘛圓寂後暫攝藏政作法降神、秉公指認、乾隆五十七年時儿制定這金瓶抽籤的定律、在拉薩大認寺中、置一余製之瓶．而將尋獲的被認為達賴轉世的小孩姓名各寫一籤、放入瓶中、由「吹忠」對眾拈定、拈着誰、誰就承繼第十四世達賴喇嘛、未拈着的、也都給予重要職位、而認為這些小孩、雖不是達賴轉世、但亦屬於天神之流、此次金瓶抽籤、典禮的主持人、國府現已明令現任蒙藏委員會委員長吳忠信氏會同現攝藏政之熱振呼圖克圖主持、至日期則尚未決定、須待在青海所尋獲的送赴拉薩後方能舉行、但由於青藏交通的困難預計行期至早亦當在今年冬季、</p>
<h3>韶汕之行</h3>
<p>沿公路各縣氣象蓬勃</p>
<p>與甯工商業突飛猛進</p>
<p>汕頭通訊、韶潮公路不特溝通者粤省東北兩江的流域、而且因為有韶連公路的銜接、就是長江上流各屬也可走通、牠的起點和終點、一則是粤省抗戰後防的重心、為戰區司令與省治所在、一則是瀕海區域、為廣州淪陷、和海口失守以後、華南唯一商埠汕頭所在的地方、在華南抗戰的現階段中、這條作為貫通粤省東北的動脈一般的公路、其被人注意並不是偶然的、記者此次由內地來歸、會以三日的時間、將全段公路走過、以時間短促、車行所見、當然是走馬看花、但沿途歷程、亦有多少不可磨滅的印象、行装卸後、因急行寫出、以備關切內地交通的人們參考。</p>
<h3>春到曲江朝氣蓬勃</h3>
<p>東下時、剛是舊曆新年過後、堅定的人心、活潑的市面、隨處都表現着蓬勃的景色、曲江已負起抗戰重心的使命來了、尤其是一般公務人員、雖然在物質生活極端缺乏之下。却個個刻苦奮發、這種情形此廣州未淪陷時確進步得許多、、交通也不致因為鐵路已經破壞而發生無可補救的困難、現在各地的長途汽車已多數暢通、雖然是車輛缺乏，但在公路上行走着的脚夫、也可能補助機械之不足、目前湘．贛.和西北江大部份的出入口貨、巳在曲江集散了、除了作為軍事，政治的重心以外、想不到曲江又成為華南的經濟重心、</p>
<h3>韶潮車運客貨激增</h3>
<p>這因為在華南抗戰的現階段中、湘.贛.和西北江的出入口貨、大都要靠這韶潮公路來運輸、所以車運一通、各地的客貨便如潮湧至了、現在曲江的旅舍中、住着的各數是候車東下的客商、商店的堆棧中。積着的多數是候車東運的土產、由內地東下的客商、非在曲江候上三四天是不容易買到車票的、甚至有時因票少客多關係、竟然用拈鬮的方法來　決定誰個買票、雖然不過是國幣二十五元。但也有人不惜出了兩三倍多的價錢來搭各商號的自備貨車的、目前在罷潮路上運貨出入的公司已有三四家、他們都自己備着新式的輕便貨車、多者有十餘輛、少者有兩三輛、多數把布疋、捲姻等日用品運入內地去、又把内地的土產運出來、聽說他們最近擭利也不少、這確是國難期中的一椿很投機的事業、</p>
<h3>翁源連平印象甚好</h3>
<p>記者在曲江候了幾天客車之後、知道短期間也買不到車票了、费了很大的麻煩、終於搭了運貨汽車東下、汽車由上月二十三日上午七時起程、同行的貨車一共有五輛之多、車上盡是從西北汀來的水菓之類的土物、走了半天、路上除了延綿的山　以外、真是什麼也看不到的、正午十二時、我們來到了翁源縣屬的一個圩鎮、名字叫做龍仙圩。這個圩因為適當芙蓉江和　江匯合的方、又因有公路可以直通河源、所以商業也此較整盛、在坪裏吃過午飯後、我們又繼續趕程了、車漸漸駛到了連平縣境、兩旁的山嶽也漸漸峻峭起來、走過了幾度危險的斜坡、又過了幾度迂迴的山麓、看看天色已迫近黄昏的時候了、而採柴的村婦、和放牧的黄牛、依然掩映於沿途荒烟蔓草之中、山嶺地帶生活之艱難、和當地人民工作之刻苦、思之令人感喟不止、下午五時、我們抵達了連平縣屬的忠信　、當晚因為行車不便、大家便分頭在圩裹找客寓　宿了、忠信圩也有公路可通河源和惠陽、附近出產的草菰和京柿、都是經山這個圩運出的、韶湖通車以後、這裏的商業尤見暢旺、因為牠接近峻嶺層巖的九連山、形势也極其險要、這確是粤省抗戰東綫後防的一個重要地方、聞說這裏的九連山、千蹊萬徑、環通九縣、足為粤省後防樹立堅强的堡壘、</p>
<h3>興甯工業高度發達</h3>
<p>在忠信圩宿了一宵、第二天清早、我們又向着老隆進發、因為行的是山地和荒郊、沿途也沒有什麼可留的印象、十一時經老隆、公路已逐漸向低地進展、下午五時車已行抵興甯了我們一到那高度繁榮的興甯城內，猛然見到這裏　現代都市的設備、　　進入了另一世界、興甯平日的布業本來是很發達的、七七以後、沿海都市陸續破壞、牠便憑藉了這種工業基礎、突然突飛櫺進地發展起來　韶潮通車以後、牠的繁榮更達到白熱的程度了、整萬的客商鎮日地在街上擁擠着、工廠的烟突、無論日夜都冒着濃烟、除了布業以外、共他工商業也漸漸成立、修理汽車的工場、製造金屬用品的工廠、甚至製造捲烟的工廠、這裏也應有盡有、出品一面山惠陽公路東運、一面由韶潮公路北輸、無疑地興甯的工商業、已替代了過去廣州應嫵内地的義務了、記者從揭陽繼續前行、下午到達潮安、住了一夜、出了潮汕鐵路的火車到汕頭韶潮公路的行程便這樣終結了、</p>

<h3>吳稚暉講　門外漢意中之教育問題（一）</h3>
<p>嚴格管理教育方不致失敗</p>
<p>國難當頭節約要以身作則</p>
<p>（重慶通訊）黨國元老吳稚暉先生、最近在渝應中國教育學術團體聯合辦事處之學術演講、講題為「門外漢意中之教育問題」於教育之管理方面，引經發典、多所闡明、極言教育非嚴格管理．不能發生功效、又以國難方殷、節約要以身作則、切實履行、語重心長，足以箴砭時俗、特錄其原文於下、</p>
<p>各位先生</p>
<p>今天承中國教育學術團體聯合辦事處容許對教育問題作一次講話、因為自己對於敦育、是一個十足的門外漢、所以今天講題、是「門外漢意中的教育問題」拿一個門外漢來講諸位所研究的教育問題、也許是太胡鬧了、然而今天是星期休息日、請諸位發笑亦好、况且對於門外漢就是胡闹、也可以做一個胡鬧的參考、</p>
<p>近幾年來、我們的領袖將總裁他的訓示中、常提到一管教養衛一四個字、最近教育部陳部長對於這四個字的意義、也有很精要的闡明、在我外行說起來、「管」就是叫人必定要加此、而且不許不如此、「教」是告訴他應當如此、所以不可不如比、育「養」也、養成功他的能力、「衛」是有了能力、足以自衛、也就能够衛國衛民、俗語常說管教管教、教就不可不管、養衛都屬於育的部份、所以管教養衛四字、歸納了、也就是教育兩字、現在用我門外漢的見解、把管教養衛再來瞎講一陣什麼是管、现在一般人常常誤解管的意義、好像管是專去管人、忘却管人的人、必先管束自己，因而人們聽到管字、心裏就不大樂意、比如說我在街上走路、有時要聽警察的指揮管理、如果我誤解了管的意義、以為我是有身分的人、來受你區區的警察的管理、其實這句話是不對的、管的事第一個條件、是能自己管自己、因為自己管自己，是最高貴、一個人等人來管、已經是下焉者了、還要不受管、簡直便丢了身分、所以最好要做到不必有人管、而能自己反省、自己知道凡是利己害人的事、決決不做、人人如此、社會當然做到不管而治、談到要不要管的問題、不由不談到性的善惡問題、討論性的善惡問題古今來已有不少的學者講過、有人說性是善的、有人說性是惡的、也有人說性是有善有惡的、以我個人的看法、性不性且不去問他、我可以妄斷一下、人是一半好、一半填的、世界人類、決不會全是好的、也不會全是壞的、你想一棵橘子樹、樹上的橘、決不會全是大個兒、其中必是好的大的有多少、小的壞的也有多少、總而言之、「人的權利是可以平等的、人的智慧、是不能平等的」、我們的孔夫子也說「中人以上、可以語上也、中人以下、不可以語上也、」什麼人才算是中人、漢書上有九等人格的分別、我想九等中四五六是中人、　一二三是中人以上、七八九是中人以下、根據這一個分等法來分別人的善惡、我們可以說、一百人中間、在善的方面有一個最好的好人，另外在善惡方面、還有四個好的、是不容易巒壞的、還有十五個好的、偶爾亦會變壞、在惡的方面、也有叫個壞的不容易變好的、也有十五個壞的、偶爾亦會變好、兩頭各去了一千個餘下來的六十個、我們叫他為中人、因為他們可以做好人、也可以做壞人、如果我們細心考察社會各界人士的行動、可以證明這一個說法是不大錯的、這個理論、用政治上的事業來說明、也可以見得、歐美是政黨政治、他們常分什麼保守自由的兩大政黨、何以兩黨的黨員、會或多或少呢、因為或多或少的緣故、有時保守黨執政、有時又變自由黨執政、照黨德講起來一個人一經入黨、應該就不能叛黨、那末一次分了多少、就應該永遠不動、何以會或多或少、這就是中人以上的決不會叛黨，那中人以下的就多是動搖份子容易改變、常有忽爾保守、忽爾自由、隨着他們的好惡、轉移着擁護、因此執政的跟着上台、跟着下台、我還幹說、無論那一個文化進步、教育發達的國家，一百人中、頂多止有六十五個是好人、至少有三十五個是壞人、反轉來說、無論那文化教育落伍的國家二百人中、終有三十万個是好人、最多也不過六十五個壞人、民國元年、有位丁福保先生、以為我會組在教育界混過、和我開玩笑、說道、「我願意出一百萬吧一天、請你把天下人全教好他、」我搖頭沒有辦法、他又說「既然教好不容易、」那末我還出一百萬元一天、請你把天下的人都教壞他、」我還是搖頭、當時聽笑話的人，也個份搖頭，現在想大家必以為嫖賭吃着、是人人喜歡的、拿嫖賭吃着來勸人、是一定中意的、那裏知道、你試試看、站在十丰街頭去教人嫖賭吃着、保護會有許多人、給耳光你吃、這是証明我到底好人終有三十五個的斷言也是不大錯的（未完）</p>

<h3>金融　大戶觀望　現金價起伏平談　結果下挫四元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、過程依然平淡、交易亦仍呆滯、結果稍向下挫、蓋各路行販路有到貨吐售所致、故雖某銀樓一度曾吸購百兩、但未蒙治何影響價則終見回跌叫元、人心尙穩、全日交易上午祇二百兩、下午一無做開、銀樓飾金亦始終乏變、海關金曁中英純金等呆定如故、</p>
<p>烚赤午後無做開</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初開多方喊二千〇八十五元賣出、但進者均袖手旁觀、致久未做開、直至十時後、某銀樓忽與買意、購進錢兌業五十兩、二千〇八十五元為開盤價、較之上週末未分榮辱、開後某銀樓又進同業五十兩八十叫元、繼之金號吐售予銀樓帮五十兩、八十三元後銀樓帮互做五十兩、價則相同、此後余號仍喊八十三元賣出、但買者巳止進旁觀、故難做開、迨至十一時光景、金號賣予錢兌業五十兩、七十八元、後某金號忽趁低吸購、致稍回平、某金號進同業五十兩、八十一元、此後供求更稀、價亦呆定、延至午時未見做開、故午收仍為八十一元、下午更形呆寂、然某金號限價八十二元買進、而售者須八十二元方肯供給、雙方擯持、至晚收時仍未做開、（據聞某錢兌業門市亦鮮少進出）、若照午收價二千〇八十一元、結果較上週末　跌四元、全天僅六元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千〇九十元、收進二千〇七十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金懸二一一元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金、每兩兌出囚烚赤無甚變幻、故亦未見更動、大同行仍懸二百十一元、新同行為二百〇九元、收進二百〇三元、</p>
<p>關純金呆立不動</p>
<p>中央銀行之中國現金收買價、仍屬一千二百十一元六角、掛牌海關金亦仍為二元三角九分四厘、上海標準標金價亦呆定於一千二百〇六元九角、乃二十五日倫敦電、英純金每盎斯仍為七鎊八先令五便士所致云</p>
<p>天津申匯漲一元</p>

<h3>外匯供求平衡</h3>
<p>涯市昨英匯雖洋行與電力公司一度扒結、但以英行滙豐對於八辦士二五、竭力維持、故為狀始終乏變、而美滙因英美滙兌已連跌二天、本應略軟、無如港電續來吐售、故結果亦未分榮辱、交易平平、至港滙因雙方供求平衡、故形勢亦頗穩定、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均平、紐的銀價依然呆定、倫敦生金亦無升降、滙兌英對美縮三毫、對法·對滬仍平、美對英降〇六二五、對法對　均未更動、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開賣價、英匯八辦士二五、美滙十六元〇九三七五、較之上週末午收、英美兩滙、均無軒輊、開後英商電力公司首來扒結滙豐英滙八辦士二五、為狀甚鮮變幻、迨滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉亦平、仍徵百分之五·〇〇、此後洋行亦來結進某行美滙十六元〇九三七五、繼之港電忽來塞予華比美滙十六元一二五、港勢略硬、近午華僑賣予洋行港滙五十五元三七五、是以過程轉平、迨午收、銀行賣價、與晨開無異、</p>
<p>後市首由洋行結進滙豐英滙八辦士二五、不久港電續來吐售、賣予有利美滙十六元一二五、入後洋行吸進廣東港滙五十五元三七五、是以狀况仍鮮變幻、迨晚收銀行賣價、英滙八辦士二五、美滙十六元〇九三七五、結果較之上週末、英美兩滙均平、港滙亦無上落、茲將一天做開交易錄後、</p>

<h3>證券　公債後市轉堅穩</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况、本有續漲之趨勢、祇以一般浮空、故意在市塲散佈向壁虛構之謠言、一般以耳代目者、從事賣出、而造謠者反乘低吸收、市價居然隨之波動不巳、至於孔財長之談話、乃係對外債而言、故市塲收市後暗中巳形趨長、揣測前途、今日當有反動、昨晨初開、鴻大承康協大及大豐等號、對於丙種頗有吸收、三十八號吸進戊種、祇以聯和潤利天生及震康等號多頭脫手、市價乃始不振、浮多出　、午前即小去三五角、午後市况淸閑、市價堅穩、五號買進甲種二十號及大豐號買進戊種、同康及七號稍有售出、市價乃有參差、高低互見、結果計小去二角半至五角半、成交總數共計的五十餘萬元、九六未有交易、茲列簡明表於後、類別　最高　最低　收盤　比前日統甲　五七四〇　五七二五　五七四〇　跌〇·二五統乙　五一五五　五一二〇　五一二五　又〇·四五統丙　五一三〇　五〇七五　五〇八〇　又〇·五五統丁　五〇〇五　四九六〇　四九七〇　又〇·五〇統戊　五〇二五　四九七五　四九九〇　又〇·四五</p>
<p>股票交易、叉成交紗布交＼易所股一百股、價仍為三十八元云、</p>
<h3>外幣盤旋帶堅</h3>
<p>上週六英純金未動、英美滙兌降零六二五、昨日本埠外滙、電力公司及洋行等、結款甚旺、港電及銀行供給尙暢、市價穩定、與前無分榮辱、烚赤開盤頗堅、銀樓幫及散戶紛起吸納、市價冉冉上升、但金號及錢兌業趁高拋塞、價復回降、續呈盤旋狀態、下午人心恍惚、市况呆鈍、交易甚稀、外幣英美金鎊、需耍未殷、英美金票、殷富出籠尙盛、外銀行吸納甚暢、趨勢堅定、公會交易甚稀、僅恒茂出祥康進美金鎊二十個、昨日市價、英金票升一分、美金票升三厘、新加坡票升一分、荷蘭票降五分、加拿大票升二分、其他各幣、俱無更動、</p>
<h3>貼現不變</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、依然呆定、每千元仍為五十元零二角五分，與上週六價相彷、</p>
<h3>紗花　存貨日積月增　紗價直綫下降　念支雙馬跌落十元許華日紗有軋平可能性</h3>
<p>紗市續挫、且跌風愈演愈熾、蓋以實需不暢各方運輸艱難、致現貨存積日見增厚、至於囤戶鑒於環境不良、將以前囤藏之貨、忍痛斬結、銀行方面、亦圖出卸，市塲益呈供過於求之勢、市價乃直綫下鎢矣、市上掮客委託賣出者居多數、因之市勢驟形紊亂、且顯見惶恐之象、市盤步步下降、二十支雙馬紗、一般投機者作其標準看待、多空籌碼充濫、所以跌風最厲、外棧價已敲破三百七十元關口、午後最低價曾做到三百六十七元、比上日價已落十元之譜、然吃客寥寥、皆不敢嘗試、可想恐懼之心、達於極點矣</p>
<p>現紗情形、晨初開盤、同業大家相聚談論樂觀者占少數、都言實需太淸、市面難立脚、多方心緒亦見闌珊、二十支雙馬紗開價微跌一元、為三百七十六元、同行成交、十五包、少頃聞現銷不旺、市價步步下跌、市上只聞賣聲不見自戶、越做越小、最低做到三百七十一元半、棧單價為三百七十元、其後某多稍提、回上二元、現貨價為三百七十三元半、午後開盤、市上人頭稀少、冷落不堪、市價須臾即跌三叫元、目賣風突起、形勢衰弱更甚、因有某種謠言之故、二十支雙馬收盤價為三百六十七元、棧單祇做三百六十六元半、結果上午各帮成交統計一千六百零五包、行情二十支變馬紗跌十元零五角、天女跌八元半、牧羊跌六元、其餘亦跌四五元之譜、十支粗紗因津帮銷路未斷、跌勢和緩、小二三元、申新廠開出十支童子軍二百五十包、價為二百八十九元、昨有棉紗三十件川溫州運來、今日尙有紗十件運香港、二百件運汕頭、茲將各帮口買去之額　列左、同行　七六〇　福建　二五汕頭　三五　天津　五四五雲南　一一五　香港　一〇五溫州　一〇　內地　一〇統計一·六〇五</p>
<p>日紗市面、仍在穩靜之境、蓋以人心看好、貝大戶頭皆在多頭地位、故華紗頻頻下降、未受影響、有人說將後華日紗價或有軋平可能性、故下月份紗價堅昂萬狀也、二十支水月現貨價又三百叫十元，二十支藍鳳現紗價為三百三十一元、</p>
<h3>花亦為紗帶落　各廠採辦停頓</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市初因利牧浦電吿良好、及華爾街略有進購而漲、唯大部同業均對棉市抱觀望態度、靜候華盛頓方面之發展也、然華盛頓各項消息之傳出、均異常矛盾、時傳施密斯提案即將執行、忽又盛傳美政府棉花出口津貼之議案、即將在國會通過云云、殊使人心異常恍惚、昨日紐的漲二磅音、印度白洛區四五月份、因有投機者操縱，昨日連同預測、猛漲二羅比半、埃及漲十磅音、昨日滙市略緊、折合法幣、棉價計美棉及巴西每祖漲五角、印棉漲一元、埃及漲一元</p>
<p>滬市外棉交易、因紗價步跌、已將五日、昨日又盛傳南昌消息不佳、紗價又跌十元、故各廠對於原棉之採辦形同停頓、唯自前各廠之存棉均甚微薄、前訂之印棉又未能尅日運到、殊為焦慮、今後之目光、巳轉移於美棉矣、茲將昨日之外棉價格分列於後、原料　類　別　送廠連稅</p>
<p>六十支埃及棉高級　一〇七·一〇　又　又　中級　一〇四·二〇八十支　又　高級　一三一·〇〇</p>

<p>四二支美種彭加浦　八九·八五</p>
<p>本棉生意益覺沉悶、惟組絨棉需要尙稱不弱市價因紗市連朝狂瀉、人氣稍形鬆懈、但存棉脆弱、故下落程度甚微、火機比週末跌二角半、通花跌五角、蘇北一路來源漸見爽暢、昨今兩日、到通州下沙花一千三百七十二包、茲將現棉成交情形如左、浙棉到五千八百包、</p>
<p>通州花　七九·五〇　同業中進　一七〇包　滙劃棧交火機花　七一·二五　又　一、〇〇〇包　現鈔又火機花　七二·〇〇　又　一、〇〇〇包　現鈔又</p>

<h3>疋頭　色漂布料紋　新加坡採辦獨健</h3>
<p>國布浙東局勢已趨穩定、遺甬各口航遝照常、當地以湘贛客戶停止採辦、銷售區域縮小、且巾甬滙兌最近已由每千元二十三元猛升至每千元六十九元、故多數訂定之貨、均留存滬埠、祇小部份急待應銷各貨、昨日仍有裝往、粵帮續辦富貴·地球·叫平蓮·人鐘·各牌細布細斜一百五六十件、色布·色斜·府綢等貨一百餘箱、本街染廠辦染坯細斜一百五十餘件、租布細布售盤勢均疲軟、散戶手貨及囤戶連日均有廉價五分至一角轉售者、川滇帮辦胃仍强、成交漂布漂斜色布印花布一百餘箱、國外新加坡採辦色布漂布色斜一千餘疋、色布漂染布疋售盤殊尠變動、而漂白細斜因上檔坯布價格提高、售盤亦加起每疋一角之譜、</p>
<p>東布白貨市面平疲、細布細斜售盤每疋回降五分左右、十二磅龍照細布與細斜、市上售開俱為　十二元、客帮殊無交易、本街染業仍續採納各牌布疋有八百餘件、</p>
<p>進口疋頭、昨有一百六十八件、由天津來滬、今（二十八日）出口、有三百五十件、運往汕頭、又五十五件、裝往香港、</p>
<h3>春大衣料缺乏　非中非西忽不行</h3>
<p>昨日呢絨零躉交易仍盛、春大衣料、市上頗見缺乏、因是而造成海律斯火姆四本等之暢銷機會矣、昨英製火姆四本普通齊書八元五角、英製海律斯頭號批沽十元、國產天津仁立貨素色售五元五角、格子為六元五角、</p>
<p>非中非西貨最近買賣均缺、除小數零剪外、　少大肚成交、聞為受有吿誡前往捐助救濟費如紅藍十字會與難民者甚夥、因之胆寒也、</p>
<h3>糧食　受洋粉傾銷影響　本粉廠盤再度減低　北洋客盤僅四元四洋粉北銷為數亦鉅</h3>
<p>現粉廠盤、續見猛跌、因本客方面、自洋粉傾銷以來、對於廠粉需耍日淡、各廠為環境所迫、惟有忍痛貶價、藉與洋粉競爭、故昨市二號粉廠盤、除本街批價較上週修小五分、减為四元五角半外、客盤僅售四元五角、又聞北洋帮更有特價叫元四角之砲車粉成交一批、市面情勢、頗為混沌、統市成交本客併計十餘萬包、市因洋粉定到不絕、廠粉前途、一時恐難發展、今日有麵粉一萬七千五百包、麩皮八千五百包運往汕頭、</p>
<p>洋粉市情、現定而期挺、因連日產價堅穩、五月份期洋粉合價每包須叫元六角、購戶方面、深恐與新麥登塲時軋脚、故亦哲無新成交、至市上現貨供給、日見充盈、而北洋帮在滬採辦洋粉者、近亦頗多、咋聞振興公司售予北洋帮蝙蝠牌標準二號洋粉二三萬包、價由四元四角漲至叫元叫角半、（滙劃票價）、而現洋粉零星去化、反覺平淡、蓋本粉台價、已較洋粉為低也、</p>
<p>麥市停頓如故、難有零星到貨、大都直接送廠與配客、其正式市面、在粉價步跌聲中、恐尙有一度擯持云、</p>
<h3>客秈步漲角外</h3>
<p>客秈咋客囤兩活、本街零化亦以客秈價盤較宜、進胃極香、故全日成交數又加至三千六七百包、高决各檔一致提高、南京秈價開十三元一角半至十二兀八九角、蕪秈十二元八九角至十二元三五角不等、比之前市校昂一角至角半不等、西貢米上週一度甩開低價後、零化漸决轉活、昨以本客秈步漲不已、貨方喊價又高至十七元一二角</p>
<h3>粳米街銷平常</h3>
<p>昨日各帮來源、河下共到八號、車來包子一千餘包、早市人心尙佳、行家都有拉進、故形勢續緊、厚薄粳價見秀幾分至一角、惟終因本街實銷平常、致晚市即轉懈淡、勢星軟態、杜洋尖埠尖情形與粳市相仿、變陰元依然供求相均、守原盤、</p>
<h3>澳麥續有裝到　美粉廿六萬包到滬本月未有此數進口</h3>
<p>澳麥不斷運來已迭誌本報、前日保利洋行Barbara　Marie號、裝來洋麥七千五百噸、停泊十三十叫號浮筒、現正在起卸中、聞該公司下月五日、又有Solvus號運麥來滬、數量尙無確報、至近日傳說有美國麥粉二十六萬包之到滬、各方探詢結果、本月內過去未有此大量麥粉進口、或者尙在途中、據航業界云、一船裝此鉅大數量者、於事實上恐不可能、（祖）</p>
<h3>油餅　生油大漲小回　豆油為日商牽制豆餅餅交易尙熱閙</h3>
<p>生油　市態因靑島方面有表示可放出前成妥之油、故人心見疲、但該油成本在統制之苛稅下、恐其售價不易過賤耳、咋祇成交膠州油一百五十件、價為二十九元及二十八元八角、此週末跌去二角、</p>
<p>豆油　市况全受大連市之支配、晨初連市微軟、人心因之忐忑、後得連電頻傳好音、市氣頓見開展、買風蓬勃、拉抬甚力、行情步步上砌、結果較上週末跳漲三四五角不等、但在收盤時由專營日商之信泰甩出五月份交三四叫百桶、價為三十二元三角、比較全日之最高價相差達六角、故今日潛勢恐呈不穩之局昨統市成交大有廠聽裝油二百聽、價為二十六元八角、豐年油一百件、烟歧油五十件、連歧大小　共叫十件、現大連油二百桶、期汕共妥開二千餘桶、</p>

<h3>雜糧　黃豆暢銷陡漲　期連豆市面僵持</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆期現、一致轉漲、四月份大連期豆因連市報升、日商無拋售之意、市面僵持、僅成交一車、價為八元三角三分、比上週六漲三分、現豆廣厦本街辦胃見活、市氣在貨稀之情形中、行情陡漲七八分、成交大連豆一車、價為八元四角四分、崇明沙黃一千三四百包、價自八元三角至八元五角七分、</p>
<p>咋由天津來豆子八百八十五包、今日則有六百包運往香港、</p>
<h3>糖市　潮糖產價　依然平穩</h3>
<p>咋糖市上落無幾、公會劃盤、二四荷粗白現貨二十四元六角半、本棧貨七角半、轉口貨四月二日、可到之貨拋出二百包、十六元五角、現轉口貨呌十六元六角、大金錢嘜高粗白本棧廿五元〇五分、太ＸＡ嘜二十四元六角、太古車白Ｂ嘜東棧交二十叫元五角半、西棧交二十四元六角七分半、成交七十餘包、振肥一號綿白二十叫元半、二號二角、三號二十三元九角、四號六角、國糖有潮帮開出上冰白二十三元五六角至二十三元三角、共百二十包、决冰花白二十二元、計三十五包、普通枝赤六十包、十叫元八角、片靑數十包、開潮規十一元三角、據汕頭電訊、車站確有被炸、但與市區無關、故市價無甚影響、查汕頭昨日來糖、有九百九十包、又二千五百八十五包、由香港運來、</p>
<h3>絲茶　雙宮廠經　昻達一零四零元</h3>
<p>國外絲市、橫濱開價略降、現貨及近期各跌十餘元、遠期小二元、紐的星期無市、滬絲市仍乏轉機、廠經及土絲外商均無問詢、昨僅法莊成交山東黃廠經十担、一四一六條紋開一五四〇元、價穩定、雙宮廠經菲商眞有相當進胃、日來採辦不下四五十担、美女牌叫〇六〇條紋昂達一〇四〇元、誠開雙宮經之新紀錄、蓋供不敷求、有以致之、又昨有湖絲五件運歐洲、茶葉本埠出口者、昨日有八百八十五箱、運往歐洲、今（二十八日）有二件、運往香港、</p>
<h3>煤炭　太平洋烟煤　新到一千餘噸</h3>
<p>烟煤市况、近甚俏俐、各工廠銷胃浩繁、客帮進意亦濃、故市上流通貨又感缺乏、日前某洋行父有太平洋烟煤新貨裝到、塊屑兩共一千餘噸、在浦東上棧、託某某等號經理售出、計開飾塊每噸三十七元、統煤三十五元、煤屑三十四元、棧房出貨、行橫另加、</p>
<h3>五金　本釘缺乏原料廠家出品奇少</h3>
<p>本廠元釘因原料缺乏、（盤元及元絲、）故廠方出品奇少、且行情允俏、每桶開十六元七角半（倍司）、唯十六元五角亦略有售出、但客帮絕少採辦、祗散戶方面略有點級、昨日成交祇百餘担而已、</p>
<h3>進出口　貨物往來頻繁</h3>

<h3>浙東沿海華軍　堅守原有防地　杭市日商準備撤退浙西將發動游擊戰</h3>
<p>自日軍在浙東有所企圖、並在富春江畔之東沙洲聞家堰地方偷渡登陸後、經駐軍痛擊、業已全部殲滅、華軍方面、為牽制日方兵力、故已調集大軍、準備向杭州總攻、發動大規模之進擊、據本市關係方面接得電吿、華軍某部、已秘密渡過錢塘江、進至北岸、對杭市採取大包圍形勢、至於浙東沿海、黃紹竑·劉建緒·兩將軍之部隊、及浙東保安大隊、均分紮各要區、實力雄厚、贛省軍情雖緊、不受影響、</p>
<p>杭市日商準備撤退</p>
<p>據甫於昨晨由杭到滬之某客談、杭州自淪陷後、日方即經建立傀儡政權、積極設法繁榮市面、但華人居民稀少、住留者純係貧苦階級、多數居民、則均為日僑、杭州旗下營·延齡路·一帶、向為熱鬧區域、現多由日人强佔店基、闢作商店、自浙東戰事揭開、沉靜之東戰塲、又復趨緊張、華軍已渡江向杭州作總進攻、故杭市日軍極為恐慌、一般日僑商人、已摒擋行囊、準備於必耍時撤離、留居閘口等處之華人、亦多相率逃避情形頗為紊亂、</p>
<p>日機壟姚炸羊光山</p>
<p>又據航業界接得甬方電吿、二十六日下午叫時、有日機三架、飛至餘姚上空、當在羊光山地方投彈十二枚、聞多數落荒郊、損害情形不大、叉悉杭州灣方面、現仍有大批日艦集結、對浙東有所企圖、並於二十四日晚、向餘姚南岸姚北鄕臨山庵等處發砲轟擊、華駐軍沉着以待、未予還擊、</p>
<p>浙西將發動游擊戰</p>
<p>軍事委員會政治部副部長周恩來、連日在浙偕黃主席紹竑巡視防務、甚為忙碌、迨日內返原籍省親後、即將赴皖南視察、並赴南昌晤贛主席熊式輝、周刻已擬就調派皖南新Ｘ軍一部、開浙省發動游擊戰工作計劃、現正與顧司令長官·劉建緒總司令·等會商、不日即可實現、今後浙省軍防、將益見强固、至現在所軍防務之分配、（一）沿海由溫台及寗波兩防守司令部隊、及浙保安處長宣鐵吾保安隊駐紮、（二）錢塘江南岸已築有防禦工程、由浙省主席黃紹竑部隊駐紮、（三）沿富春江等處、由湘軍劉建緒部隊駐紮、日軍進犯、決非得遑、</p>
<p>鎭海口外擊傷日艦</p>
<p>鎭海口外瀝港洋面、二十四日晚、有日艦數艘停泊、鎭海要塞砲台、奉令開砲轟擊日艦、聞有一艘為砲彈擊中受傷、現鎭海口外之日艦、業已他駛、惟浙東洋面、時有日艦弋巡、集中杭州灣之日艦、達十餘艘迄未他駛、普陀洛伽山洋面、前晨由東北駛來日艦一艘、在附近下鐺停泊、當晚卽啟椗他駛、又溫州杵門洋面停泊之日航空母艦、亦已他駛、</p>
<h3>江南造船所　被便衣隊擊燬　日軍封鎖滬杭公路楊林口日艦遭掃射</h3>
<p>前日（二十六日）南市突然戒嚴、而十六舖上游江面、水陸交通、亦被日軍封鎖、後據調查、係前晚（二十五日）有華方便衣隊百餘名、包圍日軍盤踞下之江南造船所、並向該所猛烈襲擊、駐防日軍雖拚力抵抗、未能將便衣隊擊走、結果日軍被擊斃十餘名、便衣隊即飄然逸去、而該所已被擊燬大半、事後日方即宣佈戒嚴、搜查行人、惟一無所獲、因「體面」攸關、故未外洩</p>
<p>掃射運輸艦</p>
<p>日軍一號運輸艦、載軍火食糧等、由滙山碼頭駛往江北接濟日軍、前日（二十五日）駛至楊林口時、被游擊隊用密集之機關槍掃射、溺斃日兵數十名、損失極鉅、</p>
<p>封鎖滬杭路</p>
<p>自中央正規軍聯合游擊隊向江南一帶迂迴推進後、日方極為慌張、杭州方面日軍、當將滬杭公路交通封鎖、企圖切斷正規軍與游擊隊之聯絡、並堆置大量障碍物、距滬二百餘里在浙江海面之積沙島、現為中國有力之游擊隊伍駐守、並聯合當地民團、擴大組織結集巳有</p>

<p>一併徵調</p>
<p>附搭輪船、前赴該島攻擊、且恐該島四週淺灘不易進襲、同時運去橡皮汽艇四十艘、復自各處抽調日語譯員及新組織之偽憲佐」等、以免言語上之隔閡、此輩偽員出發時、除譯員外、餘均被迫携帶短槍及手溜彈、但未言明此去任務、二十五展運輸輪巳抵橫沙島外、並將橡皮艇逐一吊下、以便</p>
<p>運兵進攻</p>
<p>且囑偽「靑年團員」為前驅、是時島上之游擊隊、瞥見日方此項動作、均在海灘嚴陣以待、適値風雨交作、恐上島不成、反遭巨大損失、乃下令退回上海、各返原防、取消攻島一舉、而被迫作戰之偽「靑年團員」、駭極而歸、均額手稱農、復恐日軍二次征調、故前昨兩日間、逃亡多名、</p>

<p>訂購外棉運滬接濟</p>
<p>滬市各華商紗廠、因淪陷區域棉花受日偽統制影響、無法運滬、同時政府因棉花係軍火原料、禁止運滬、以致各廠原料缺乏、不得已向印度等處訂購外棉、本年一二兩月進口棉花、計十六萬七千七百八十五公擔、價値國幣一千一百八十萬零三千零二十元、以印度為最多、計八萬二千七百十四公擔、巴西决之、計二萬一千二百七十一公擔、埃及再决之、計一萬八千一百九十三公擔、</p>

<h3>愛情是夫婦的基礎</h3>
<p>夫婦愛情深，是一好家庭；</p>
<p>丈夫體衰弱，晴天起愁雲！</p>
<p>家庭是人們的歸宿，是社會的基礎，家庭的主幹是夫婦，這是誰都知道的。但夫婦的甚礎是什麼呢？昧於此的人恐怕不在少數。因為社會上在金錢魔力下買賣式的婚姻，以及為封建勢力所支配，祇憑媒灼之言父母之命的男女結合，或竟指腹成婚，紅顏白髮..種種的奇形怪狀，尚不一而足。此外一般愚蠢的男女，或昧於虚榮，或惑於外表，草草成就了他們的好事，就此斷送了他們終聲的幸福者，也是比比皆是。男女同居，而無愛情，所謂同床異夢，徒令青春之蹉跎，豈不大可衰乎？</p>
<p>然則夫婦的基礎究竟是什麼呢？無疑是爱情，一對恩愛的夫婦，不特他们昕夕相處時，心心相印，脈脈相連，生育着伶俐的子女，組織着快樂的家庭，生活是何等的幸福！就是一且別離，遠隔千里，也是情絲繚繞，夢魂相叙，大有不能分離之概！他們愛情何以如此深切？這在我們醫學上的研究，不外為女性身體特徵的發達，具有一種强烈的美感力吸引着男子；以及男子精力的雄健，能適應女性的要求。此外關於男女的思想，道德，人格等部分，固然亦有關係，但並不主要。因為這個緣故，女子對於美所以特別的講究，婚後男子的對于精力，尤須特別保重。真的能够男健女美，他們必然會情深如海，樂勝于飛。要是男子如果於早年犯有自瀆遺精，或婚後的荒淫縱慾，以及其他憂勞　傷之故，爆發着滑精漏精，早洩陽萎，發育不全，神經衰弱，精薄不育等症，則夫婦生活即不能圆滿，愛情因以破碎無遺，若延不速冶，更將夫婦反目演出家庭間之種種悲劇！關於治療之法，據世界名醫及余經驗，均以服生殖腺業製劑「生殖素」最為對症特效，因此劑於服後一日夜間即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，若能繼續服用，必可於短期內將上述各症完全治愈，並可收延年益壽返老還童之效·惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，制此遺洩，則收效尤速。</p>
<p>健美</p>
<h3>乳峯萎癟的悲慘！</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>自從女子須有健康美的聲浪，遍佈到各個都市以後。我想凡是乳癟顏我的醜陋的女子。都應該憬然覺悟了！因為女性的畢生幸福，可以說完全操縱於一對乳峯，如果乳峯蒌癟了，健美喪失了，那麼她的環境無論怎樣好，也逃不了惡魔的宰割，玆試舉最近來函詢問的一例如下：「……要說我的環境，家里僱有許多傭僕，出入有汽車代步，服裝的講究，享用的精良，可說極盡人間富貴，但我因為自小多病多痛，現在更是月經不凋咧，白带咧，腹病啊，腦脹咧，使得我身體上沒有一天健爽，而尤其覺得抱憾的，因疾病的不時侵襲，竟至容顏憔悴，臀部瘦削，而乳峯尤其萎癟碍可憐，我無論怎麼樣的打扮，可是走出去，人們看到我，不知怎的，終是竊竊私議，有一位快嘴的親戚，背地里竟稱我[老槍寡老]我聽到了這種稱呼，真真氣得發昏，然而發昏有什麼用呢：唉!……我今年是二十五歲均人了，可是我還沒有對像，青春虛度，能不……」以×小姐的環境，其遭遇猶如此，其他環境不如她的人，則其命運的悲慘：也就可想而知了。不過時至今日，科學萬能，此種缺陷，也是很易彌補，蓋乳癟颜衰的主要原因，完全為卵巢機能失健而影響新陳代謝作用所致，如此時服以對症良藥卵巢製劑「女用生殖素」，則不難於短期的消滅婦科各症，使身體日臻强健，則乳峯·自然高聳，面色自潤，如果繼續服用，且能却病延年，青春長駐，</p>
<h3>白凟遺精等於自掘墳墓</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>也許我们的吶喊太微弱了吧，然而已聲嘶力竭了，我們看着大批大批的青年往墳墓裏去跑，真是不安之至；這果是時代的厄運，但也是我人的責職所在，搥胸自問，負疚良深！不過，時代的青年呀，你們也得自如保重，要是一點也不自覺悟，那旁人的努力也是徒然的。青年人應得覺悟自身責任的重大，尤其在這大時代裏，差不多一切的一切，都要等待着你們的起來，可是要負荷此種責任，準備未來的奮起，都非有堅强的體格，聰明的頭腦不辦。我們固知兢兢業業克苦鍛煉以期為國效勞的青年也不在少。但大都沉湎於酒也，或於春情發動期犯上自漬或早年縱慾等原因，致斷傷了性機能，精關失司，繼起遺精。或更由遗精的次數頻繁，造成滑精漏精，腎虧無能，發育不全，神經衰弱等症，則終日困頓在萎糜病苦之中，不特不能負菏時代的巨艱，則在傅宗接代的夫婦生活，亦每不能履行，而為妻痛恨，演出家庭間之種種悲劇，所以此病不除，直猶置身於墳墓之中，雖奄奄一息，生於人間，亦有何意義？</p>
<p>關於遺精的特效療法，據世界名醫及余經驗，均以為必須清心寡慾。戒絕自凟，並服「希米脫氏固精片」，以固精關，鎮靜精神，遺精即可痊愈。如因遺精已引起上述症象者，须兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補精血，增强腦腎，若能繼續服用，必可早日康復，并可收延年益壽之效。</p>

<p>義務送診僅收　號金四角</p>
<h3>破壞生殖組織之淋病</h3>
<p>淋病一物，以其繁殖力甚速，破壞力甚大，故患淋病之人，無不終身視為莫大之累。且其破壞之處，恒不離其生殖器組織的部分，拟攝獲腺炎也，精囊炎也，輸精管炎也，睾丸炎也等，無不有毀滅生殖機能之可怖。故因淋病而失孕，百分之八九十，是每個白濁患者，不可不加注意之事。宜細心偵察病象，確實證明屬於淋病種症狀狀。所以在診斷方面之醫械，必須求其齊備。如尿道鏡，膀胱鏡，高倍顯微鏡，載物玻璃等，俱不可少，蓋診斷明白，猶如在戰爭上對敵方偵察敵情虛實、及其匿藏之所在地，此等情形既明，然後出奇致勝，庶幾敵為我擒。治療琳病，亦猶是也。先用科學方法，診断病情所在，然後用科學方法，作徹底之根治，於是雖極其頑固而難治之白濁，亦不足畏矣，在根的種種能使生殖毁滅之白濁，則德國希氏血清，共殺菌能深入組織，並可增强抗淋禦毒之能力，其效力優於一切血清及色素针劑。可以代替一切手術。而一方更用德國藥根納博士最新發明之濾淋平流電療法，以導子插入尿道内，則雖頑强之淋菌，決難抵抗此種投射之電力，故尤能發揮希氏血清殺菌之功效。更能濾清由淋菌所產生之毒素，故濾琳電療，為最進步之電療，並世無二。已為泰西各大花柳病院所採用。凡各種破壞生殖組織之淋毒，可短期治愈，並保證恢復生殖能力。</p>

<p>言論</p>
<h3>勉新藥業並告醫師公會</h3>
<p>— 劉以祥</p>
<p>余素來愛用國產新藥，最初因恐品質不純，用時頗覺不安，然經過愼重檢查與選擇後，結果尙稱滿意，竊以為慰。然近來藥廠增多，新藥種類亦日增，甲廠出一新藥，乙廠丙廠必起而傚允之，甚至不惜偷工减料互相競爭，使愛用者十分失望。試觀一二八以前之橡皮業，因某廠獲利頗豐，大家急起直追，粗製濫造，跌價傾銷，結果無利可獲，或破產，或倒閉，兩敗俱傷，此所謂自殺政策是也。今新藥業所採之途徑頗類於此，前車可鑒，吾不能不為之危。彼歐美各國藥廠出品質料純一，且時加改良，然我國藥廠只貪目前小利，銷路好即减其品質者有之。吾盼新藥業者有遠大之眼光，以振興國貨為己責，精益求精，勿因競爭而使品質低下也。例如酵母製劑競爭最劇，價雖减低而品質遠不如前矣。醫界所希望者，為可以代替洋貨之優良品，而非粗製之廉價品。各廠應有互助合作之精神，不宜减質競爭，二三家用補品關係尙輕，若一切醫用針藥均照此辦法，則新藥業前途十分可悲，結果使愛用國貨者不得不轉購高價之外國貨矣。彼瑞士汽巴藥廠，羅氏藥廠，出品不多而件件精良，吾意我國新藥業者，應以彼等為標本，勿粗製濫造，幸甚幸甚。</p>
<p>最後對於醫師公會有一提議，耶醫師公會居領導之地位，應聯合兩租界衛生局，對於新藥舉行登記，合格者與以證書，如登記後發覺品質不良或不符標準者當處分之。如此則不正當營業者有所戒懼，正當營業者有所保障，醫師對於合格之藥品可以安心使用，一舉而有數利，望當局諸公努力圖之。</p>

<p>洗浴是清潔衛生的第一步，這事盡人皆知，不須說明。可是除掉設備完美的學校，高尙的團體機關，自備浴室外，都會中人還可以向大旅社開有浴室的房間洗浴，其他人們的洗浴問題，只好完全寄托在公共浴室，——俗稱混堂，這是男人洗浴的專利塲所，女人的洗浴只好等待夏神到臨，才可以便宜行事。關於跑進公共浴室的浴客的化費繁重，浴巾的通用，大湯的骯髒，這些關於浴室的根本改良問題，此刻都拋開不談，現在先來討論兩個問題。這兩個問題是公共浴室的特殊風光，便是「擦背」和「揑脚」，我須申明不批評職業的價値，單從衛生的觀點上貢獻一點意見，做浴客的參考。每一處公</p>
<p>擦背問題</p>
<p>每一處公共浴室，都預備着一大批裸體的擦背司務，供浴客們使喚。假如浴客不要擦背，在他們極不歡迎，浴室內伺候你像似非常冷淡了。所以浴客們踏進公共浴室大半是受擦背的，有些肥胖的老客人，還要指定一二能手，重重的渾身按擦，輕擦不止癢，有些老浴客是每天洗浴，每天要擦，不浴不擦，便要發癢難熬，有些還要用滾湯的浴水，隨湯隨擦，這些跟着公共浴室造成的習慣。若就醫學衛生的觀點來論斷，就頗有疵議了。何以呢？在擦背的時候，皮膚部分一時充血，換言之，便是人體內大部分血液都趕到皮膚部分來了。因此上在浴室過久，容易發生昏暈，像是急性腦貧血等急變病症，面色蒼白，人事不知，累得大衆驚惶不知所措，這類新聞是常常可以聽得的。皮膚充血，內臟一定貧血，因為人體血液量有限，不會因洗浴而增加。若然照俗語說的餓肚裏剪髮，飽肚裏洗浴，那就更不合理，因為內臟貧血，消化器管也跟隨貧血，消化力一定减退，所以飽食之後去洗浴擦背，極容易引起消化障礙，極不相宜的·假如每天洗浴擦背，在浴室中時間久常，在冬季裏引起感冒的機會加多，每天用滾湯浴水洗擦，皮膚淺層神經常常受着滾水的麻醉，皮膚的營養會變壞，抵抗會减退，皮膚寬鬆，容易感染皮膚病或發生濕疹。我們很容易看見許多常常洗浴擦背的人，頗多是患着皮膚病的，大概與擦背的習慣，着實有些因果關係吧！還有要附帶提出警吿的一件事，許多初患疥瘡的，總是跑進浴室去擦背，雖然擦背之後，可以一時止癢，却是皮膚因此充血而抵抗薄弱，滾湯的浴水並不能把病蟲湯死，却是第二天疥瘡的蔓延便更快而更多，這是一定的經過。我不是說患疥瘡的不好一洗浴，洗浴確是極好，只是不要擦背，因為是利弊相乘，並且是弊多利少。</p>
<p>揑腳問題</p>
<p>許多人離開學校生活，踏進社會做事，跑進公共浴室洗浴之後，漸漸傳染了揑脚的習慣，被揑的人又痛又殺癢，有說不出的痛快淋漓的感覺。初揑時有半推半就又歡喜又恐怕的情况，一决兩决揑過之後，便會像吸烟上癮似的，欲罷不能之勢。又些有老癮頭的，還要挑選熟手，重重按揑，揑到皮破水流，方肯罷休。可是浴室中所用的捏脚布老是那一塊，那些老浴客老揑腳的朋友，多半是患有慢性濕疹或者腳癬（香港腳）的，在左揑右揑一揑再揑的當兒，全般浴客便個個染着腳濕氣或者香港腳。著者有幾個接近的朋友，個個親嘗這種况味，有幾决還被揑脚人揑破大塊皮膚，因此上血膿纏綿，好多時不肯收口，有幾位便立意永不揑脚，結果舊日的脚濕氣香港脚竟爾完全吿痊，這都是極確實的事實。社會上還流行着一種不切實的套語，說是脚濕氣治好了，濕熱內攻，會變內病。此話切莫相信。腳濕氣在繼續不斷揑腳的人實在難治，所謂治好後變內病的流行成語，可莫是醫生卸責任的說法，在息着內病的時候，身體上各種皮膚濕疹等等委實可以减輕些。這是因為內病時皮膚營養不良，寄生於皮膚層病菌類多萎枯而死，且皮膚分泌物亦大為减少之故，所以揑脚的習慣可以說是一無是處。脚部本來容易害濕疹，不能保證不揑脚的人永不患濕疹，可是揑脚實在是推波助瀾，帮助傳染的最好方法，顧不得浴室掌倌着惱，無從討好浴客，勸衆浴客痛下決心，趕快戒除揑脚，這種習慣是有損無益的。</p>

<h3>科學化之中藥（續第六期）</h3>
<p>— 周夢白</p>
<p>（解熱藥二）黃苓　Scutellaria　baicalinsis,Georg.</p>
<p>形態</p>
<p>本品乃於十一月至翌年二月間，採集黃苓之根而乾燥之者，其植物為脣形科多年生草木，吾國北省均產之，地下之根，為深黃色，性堅硬，莖高一公尺左右，葉對生，無柄，作披針形，其端尖銳，葉腋間抽出穗狀花序，夏日開淡紫色脣形花，花後結小球形之瘦果。</p>
<p>氣味與禁忌</p>
<p>味微苦，故性為苦平，畏丹砂，牡丹皮，及藜蘆。</p>
<p>品質</p>
<p>茶褐色而堅實者為上品，稱條苓，老根及中虛者為下品，稱枯苓，現以山西熱河產者為佳，高麗日本產者其品下。</p>
<p>成分</p>
<p>含有黃色針狀或板狀晶之　Scutellarin，據近時之報吿，稱其根中含有WoogoninC16　H12　05及Baicalin　C21　H18　O11二種誘導體。</p>
<p>效用</p>
<p>為解熱强壯藥，又治流行性感冒，破傷風，嘔吐，及下痢有效。一日量，三至十公分，為煎劑應用。古方黃芩湯者，是以黃苓九公分，大棗九公分，甘草六公分，芍藥六公分，水六〇〇公分，煎成二〇〇公分，一日三决分服，適應於熱性下痢症，大腸加答兒及赤痢。</p>
<p>舊說</p>
<p>苓，說文作荃，謂其色黃也。又苓者，黔也，乃黃黑之色也，故因以名之曰黃苓。陳修園論黃苓曰，黃芩與黃連黃蘗皆氣味苦，而色黃，主治大略相似。大抵氣塞皆能治熱，味苦皆能燥濕，色黃皆屬於土，黃而明亮者則屬於金，金借土之色以為色，故五金以黃金為貴。古時無科學原理論藥，有如此苦難，何今之謂藥者，尙喜從古也，缺科學知識乎？抑有意尊舊乎？</p>
<h3>談風濕痛</h3>
<p>— 汪于岡</p>
<p>風濕痛這箇病名是舊俗通稱，他的涵義如何？從命名上是指出因風因濕。但風濕二因大的是誘因，他的病原恐怕別有所在，照這病的症狀，在新醫病類裹面找去，我覺得和僂麻梯司Rheumatismus一症最為類似，所以我嘗把他譯做風濕痛。不過新醫所謂神經痛，舊俗也可認為風濕痛，梅毒性肌炎，關節炎，骨膜炎等，也可誤為風濕痛。反之，眞正風濕痛，也可誤為梅毒，這種錯誤，同樣地是舊俗不認識診斷學價値的緣故。風濕痛的病原，經多數舉者竭力追求，確實至今尙未發見，不過多數人都從傳染性方面去探討，科學上底　埴索途，原是一種艱辛的工作。風濕痛的病人是很多底，我國南方人較北方人為多，這恐怕是南方空氣中濕度較高的緣故吧。他所侵體部，分為肌肉和關節二種，他的症狀分為急性和慢性兩種，肌肉風濕痛的急性症狀，為較大肌肉底疼痛腫脹，例如背部的僧㡌肌，頸部的胸鎖乳頭肌，肩部的三角肌，胸肌，肋肌，腰肌等等，或侵犯一肌，或同時侵犯數肌，疼痛劇烈，每發高熱，苟無心臟病變，豫後大抵良好。慢性者無熱，疼痛亦輕，帶有痠性，時發時止，不易斷根，關節風濕痛急性症狀，和前者相同，惟侵犯在關節，或一箇或數箇不等，每每併發心內外膜炎或肋膜炎底危險。慢性者大都限於一關節，時發時止，以致妨碍運動·本病的療法，急性雖是危險，但易於奏效，其法須內服外用和注射三種並施。內服劑中，當然用撒酸劑為主，副以强心劑，倘熱度過高，再加以解熱劑，外用藥以鎭痛消炎為主，如冷菴法，塗布魚石脂，莨菪軟膏等，注射藥中，以Atophanyl靜脈注射奏效最速，惟須注意病人的心臟是吾健全·慢性者，內服撒酸劑及碘劑，外用熱水浴及溫巴布劑，或人工太陽燈，但奏效都慢。至於注射藥現認防己劑為有良效，我屢用亦不能滿意，要之本病病原尙未發明，宜其治法允難特效也。</p>
<p>食養常識</p>
<h3>食養之科學研究</h3>
<p>— 周振禹</p>
<p>引言</p>
<p>飢則求食，渴則求飲，故飲食者，生命之所繫也。惟知求食求飮，而不知飮食之效力若何，小則逐漸損害健康，大則足以致病，食養之道，豈可輕忽乎。</p>
<p>查吾國醫籍，尚有淮南王之食經，孟詵之食療本草，孫思邈之古今食治，古人注重食養之道，可見一斑矣。惟於廿世紀中，科學進步，日新月異，而對於食養之智識，亦有新的發展。故作者以食養常識之所及為經，以科學研究之所得為緯，願以質諸常世君子。</p>
<p>（一）食養之重要性</p>
<p>事業之成功與吾，以有無健康體魄為歸，有健全之身體，方能有健全之精神，有健全之精神，事業則無往而不利。欲保持體魄健康，非有適當之食養不為功。</p>
<p>食養之新學識，實乃現代科學之主要發現，此種學識，其顯著之特性，乃常識所可及，人人所可實施者也。如遵循其道，畢生之幸福與愉快無窮矣。（未完）</p>

<h3>贊助「抵制吐痰運動」</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>似乎有人說，在現在舉國忙着抗戰的當口，有些與抗戰並無直接關係的事情，竟可以省省，並且就將辦這些事情的力量，移過來專作抗戰的用塲。於是「抵制吐痰運動」，也就被一部份人視為這些事情之一，以為發起這運動的上海婦女團體聯合會，儘可以放下這事不幹，而幹些更為急需的事情。</p>
<p>這話當然是對的。然而我以為在這時期發起這一個運勁，也並沒有什麽不對之處。抗戰為第一，不錯；但是為第一而已，並非說除抗戰之外，什麽事情，允其是公益事情，都不要做。所以只要仟何團體，發起任何正當運動，在不忘抗戰為第一的條件下，分工合作，或行有餘力而為之，誰又能說是不應該的呢？何况這個運動，的確與民族的健康大有關係，我們本來是應該隨時隨地，與以注意的·世界文明的進步，只有健康的民族才能担任；而抵禦外侮的成功，也只有健康的民族優為之。我們要健康，也就不得不抵制吐痰！</p>
<p>似乎還有人說，這一運動在上海發起，竟有些像做給歐美人看，來維持我們體面的意思。假使果眞如此，則認為大可不必多此一舉。這話，我也認為有相當的理由，因為我們自有我們的習慣，例如他們在相見時握手，我們則拱手，何必一定要遷就他們，學他們的樣，給他們稱讚一聲呢。然而吐痰，這不良的習慣，究竟是什麼一會事？我以為不吐痰，至少不亂吐痰，實是每一個現代人所應該辦到的事，管什麼給歐美人看不給歐美人看呢！正如歐美人喜歡競技運動，我們也應該提倡競技運動一樣，不能說我們在學時髦。</p>
<p>此外，我以為這一運動在上海或任何大都市發起，允其比了內地小城市或鄉村來得迫切。因為人多的地方，癆菌更加能够肆其猖獗。我希望就我們目前而論，這運動現在在上海發起了，我們上海的居民，都會起來一致贊助，實行抵制。</p>
<p>老實說，我們釗一處地方，咳吐之聲，不絕於耳，走一步路，遣漿薄液，不絕於目，這畢竟是一個什麽現象！在我個人，眞是深惡而痛絕之！為什麽我們要放任不管，而不予以根本剷除呢！</p>
<h3>晨操</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>——壯丁生活的片段</p>
<p>曙光割開了暗夜的天。原野，就漸漸的變了顏色；樹葉，野草，都透露着淸晨的溫柔氣息；捲疊的行雲，也隨着朝陽上昇，競放着綺麗瑰華的色彩，——幾朶金黃，幾朵靑紫，幾朶乳白。</p>
<p>號音由晨風巾播送開來，在沉靜的太空裏，更莊嚴而嘹喨！每一個壯了都被振奮得雄心勃然了。</p>
<p>我們冒衝着濛濛的朝氣，跑進操塲，奔向那迎風飄動的隊旗下。一夥兒跑步，脚底下都發出：「刺沙…刺沙…」的聲響，煤渣路上被激起了黑灰，瀰瀰漫漫的，把傍路的草地，滬上了一層黑粉。</p>
<p>「噓噓——噓——」又突然響起了一陣集合的口哨。</p>
<p>站立在隊旗下，一夥兒排列成一條長的隊伍：立正，看齊，…隨着敎練官的雄壯的聲調，開始動作。循環式的行進，一次，二次，三次……然後，更與奪地，更緊張地，跑步，疾奔，臥倒，衝擊；再進而化整為零，集零為整。</p>
<p>這些動作操練過後，就開始分成兩個敵對的集團，演習陣地戰，佈置游擊網，擾亂敵人的後方，和輔助正規軍反攻。一切智和力的運用，好像就是一個現實的戰况！</p>
<p>一夥兒雖然都出了汗，頭上像個蒸籠，熱氣騰騰的，汗珠由頭上流到面頰，滴到衣襟；但誰都沒察覺到這些。</p>
<p>稍息的時候，敎練官收束了嚴肅，非常和藹地，對我們說話：</p>
<p>「你們一羣中，雖然有不少養尊處優的少爺，公子，但你們的紀律和動作的成續，幾乎可以等於正規軍隊；不過，我們不能自滿，因為我們都是現階段抗戰的預備隊，我們正有着復興民族，造成新中國的職責！要：更勇毅，更堅定，向着民族解放的標的去奮鬥！……」</p>
<p>當他說完了話時，臉上還浮起一陣慈祥的微笑：繼着，就命令歌唱，散隊。</p>
<p>興奮的一夥兒，於是更興奮了；揚起雄壯的歌喉，高唱着：「我們為了民族生存的自由，不惜用我們的熱血，不惜用我們的　顱，向着侵略者去搏鬥！……」</p>
<p>這時候，隊伍帶着歌聲，莊嚴地走出操塲，每個人看淸那麼美麗的原野，浴在朝陽裏；心版上，又加厚了驅寇的熱望。</p>
<h3>讀書看報心得（下）</h3>
<p>— 吐老</p>
<p>某報載：某藝術家到某方「服務」去了。可不知道「服」的是甚麽「務」？照情理想來，大概總不外是書畫去的。</p>
<p>然而我却想起趙子昂來了。</p>
<p>趙子昂書馬，據說先要伏地自作一個馬姿勢，然後動筆。這傳說雖然在表面上是恭維趙子昂寫實的本領，但在實際上，我看還是暗暗地在駡着趙子昂的。趙子昂的畫馬，若照我來解釋，那恰是當時北方外放（金人和元人）侵入中國的現實所給的材料。塞外的馬是當時戰爭最好的工具，中國底歷史家早已感歡過了。趙子昂的畫馬，是由於羨慕，敬畏，驚異，現在都無從考察。但到了他「忠赤保皇元」以後，他會給「皇元」底將軍們書幾幅他們養的馬底「肖像」，却是萬分可能的。藝術家到這時候已經成獻媚家了。所以我以為那個傳說實在是一個諷喻。</p>
<p>但現在的藝術家要去給優入者獻媚，却有點困難。汽車，坦克車，飛機，自然也可以畫的，不過那就是盡得像，也沒有甚麽生氣。只有畫大砲還較為有意思，但也須得畫正在轟人的大砲。然而畫家又不能够帶着筆到戰塲上去畫的。學趙子昂罷，自已先讓大砲轟一下，但又難免要送掉性命。——這眞是沒有法子想。</p>
<p>然而我忽然父想起了芥川龍之介底小說「地獄變相」中所描寫的那位畫家底命運…啊，還是不要說下去罷。</p>
<p>我愛看廣吿，但意思只是為懂得一點社會上的新鮮花樣。目前的廣吿眞是比從前精彩得多了。</p>
<p>「應付國難，需身體活潑。」是跳舞廳的廣吿。「為來客易於顧念難民，菜價大犧牲。」是菜館底廣吿。「耍抗戰，第一須身體强壯，酒即能生血補神。」是酒店底廣吿…</p>
<p>然而最精彩的是：「國難時期，須求健康」，而要「健康」則須吃藥，而吃藥的功效則是「定使尊夫人滿意」。</p>
<p>我們提倡了「幽默」好幾年，到現在纔眞的有了「幽默」。但可惜「幽默」家又不來留心了。</p>
<p>然而最足以表示孤島上的盛况的，却還是到處在翻印着禁書」，眞像我們現在住在了一個革命政府的治下似的。但一看名目，「禁書」倒是「禁書」，却都是為了該書的實在誨淫而「禁」了的。現在我們底眼福倒眞不淺，可以看到道樣許多的好寶貝。照這樣下去，我看「肉蒲團」「杏花天」一類的「禁書」，也都快要被鄭重地翻印出來了，亞門！</p>
<h3>「春」</h3>
<p>— 劉蘭</p>
<p>有人愛黃葉飄零，落花滿地的季節。秋陽夕照中躑躅於古徑間，伴着自己孤獨的影子；或是庭院小坐，凝視黃葉，閒數落花，而人們却說：「這未免太蒼老遲暮了，年靑的人不應如此撇棄紅塵·」然而據說，詩人的慧眼却仍能從秋裏看出「生」。</p>
<p>還有人愛冷酷的嚴冬，一片白茫茫的雪，琉瑙世界。據說道也是詩人的氣質，更是勇士的性格。我的思想遂馳騁於莽原，大野，冰天雪地中了。幹着偉大工作的鬥士們的心境又是如何呢？咒詛抑是欣賞？道答案且讓事實來塡補吧！</p>
<p>而我，凡俗的庸人，却渴望着春天，活躍而富有生命力的季節呵！</p>
<p>耳邊響起了一陣話語：「春天來了！」不知是誰向我輕悄悄的可嚀。聲調是那麼溫柔，和諧。推波助瀾，定將成為一曲動人的戀歌。但我却淡淡的說：「我們這兒沒有春天。」大的是憤慨於這漢然的態度吧，並無回話，來客的足音漸漸的消失於遠方。</p>
<p>推開窗，抬頭仰望。穹蒼是灰黯的，塞滿烏雲。遠天吹來一陣風。難道是帶來春的信息？我疑問着。迎面送來一口刺鼻的血腥，並非春的氣息。「我們這兒沒有春天，」我又默念着這句子。隨手關緊了窗戶。</p>
<p>駕一葉回想的輕舟，蕩漾於記憶的海面：整個冬天，我背誦着雪萊的名句：「如果冬天到了，春天還會遠嗎？」是呵，春天緊跟着就將來的·但如今，冬天去了，而我們這兒仍沒有春天。</p>
<p>「雜花生樹，羣鶯亂飛。」一派和煦的氣象，媚人的景致，也眞易使人嚮往。但江南的原野，不，整個的大地，再也不是寗靜，肅穆的了。惡魔帶來了大騷動。平原上點綴着荒凉：破垣斷屋，血淋淋的屍身，被侮的少女，受難的童穉。朋友，這難道是春天的象徵？</p>
<p>吿訴你：「我們這兒沒有春天！」</p>
<p>然而呵，我還要吿訴你：「春天是會來的。」經過了汗的栽培，血的灌溉，大地便將回春，原野上蕩漾着醉人的春風。</p>
<p>可是，末了，我却要問你了：「你將如何的來為大地——我們的母親出汗，流血呢？」</p>
<p>「喂，你說，你說啊！」</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>『今天你做丈人，我沒有什麽東西奉敬，現在就敬你這一杯，請你不要推却。』</p>
<p>陳鎭長推了一會，見推不掉，便舉起他自己面前的杯子說：『遵命！遵命！我喝就是。』</p>
<p>『不行！要喝一定得喝我面前這杯，這纔像個禮數。』獨眼李搶過陳鎭長的酒杯，換上他自己的杯子說。</p>
<p>陳鎭長情知巳被獨眼李識破機關，要推拒不喝，反而敗事。他把心一橫，反而仰天大笑說</p>
<p>『哈！哈！你疑心我會在這大喜的日子毒死你們嗎？旣然不相信我，我喝給你看就是。』</p>
<p>說罷，仰起脖子來，把那杯有毒的酒一飮而盡，順手再給獨眼李斟上杯有毒的酒，慇懃地勸大家乾杯。獨眼李見陳鎮長把酒喝乾，便不再疑心，Ｘ軍官和宣撫班長當然更不疑有他，同時父因陳鎭長慇懃苦勸，情不可却，不知不覺都把杯裹的酒喝乾了。</p>
<p>酒落歡腸，談笑便放縱了起來，Ｘ軍官和獨眼李兩人不住把話來尋宣撫班長的開心，樂得個宣撫班長嘻開了嘴只是笑。獨眼李又向陳鎭長說：</p>
<p>『你們秀月小姐和宣撫班長眞是天造地設的一對。』</p>
<p>陳鎭長這時已經腹痛如絞，但他仍舊强笑着說：</p>
<p>『那里話！只恐小女不才，不足以奉箕帚！』</p>
<p>『這是東亞協……協……』宣撫班長「協」不下去了，他兩手捧着肚子說：『怎麽我的肚子忽然痛了起來！』</p>
<p>經他這樣一說，Ｘ軍官和獨眼李也都覺得肚子作痛，非常難過，忍不住都瞋月向陳鎭長喝問說：</p>
<p>『這是怎麼的？』</p>
<p>陳鎭長痛得再也忍耐不住，他離開了座位，亂蹦亂跳，一面却還在哈哈大笑。</p>
<p>『哈！哈！哈！什麽在歡大會，分明是送死大會，正是天堂有路你不走，地獄無門闖進來……』</p>
<p>Ｘ軍官怒不可遏，抜出手槍來，對準陳鎭長頭部，就是砰的一槍·隨着這一槍的發出，他自己和宣撫班長獨眼李也都七孔流血的倒下地來了。</p>
<p>這一幕驚人的活劇，聞動了正在醉生夢死歡呼痛飮的Ｘ偽軍，紛紛圍攏來探望·也就在這當兒，猛可裏，「蓬」的一聲號砲，葉團長的軍隊，巳從東西北三路反攻進合浦鎭來·（四四）</p>

<h3>戰時的日本</h3>
<p>— 公懷</p>
<p>日軍自從在盧溝橋畔放了把侵略野火後，到現在，已二十一個月了。當戰事初起時，日本的軍人，滿望可以「旗開得勝，馬到功成」，用「少量的兵力」來僥取「大量的利益」，他們以為在飛機，大砲，兵艦的新型戰具上再加上有計劃的政治陰謀，不難使我國「屈膝」。但在我軍堅強抗戰下，「速戰速決」已成一場春夢，這當然非　武主義者始料所及。</p>
<p>那末，戰時的日本，究竟呈露着什麼景象呢？請看下面的消息，雖然都是些「瑣碎」的社會動態，似乎「無關宏旨」，但以「小」喻「大」，從這裏不難想見侵略者所稱得的結果了。</p>
<p>教授飢荒</p>
<p>據日本文部省消息，最近全國各大學，因有大批教授，助教，參加人民陣綫集團，或涉有反戰思想，被人舉發，而遭受停職處分或逮捕者，已很不少，於是，各大學莫不痛感教授飢荒，弄得荒木文相應付為難。現東京帝大等六大學，合計教授不足一六九名，助教還不足一六二名，真是開日本教育界空前未有的現象。</p>
<p>無法出嫁</p>
<p>日本的女性，仍沒有脫離封建社會的束縛性，仍沒有脫離封建社會的束縛，「良妻賢母」，是她們最高的道德指標，大多女子，是以「結婚」為解決生活的捷徑，但最近，因對華戰事的延宕不決，年青的男子，紛紛被從發到中國前綫來，而且傷亡數又那末的多，無形中，奪去了不少日本少女的丈夫，使已届結婚年齡的少女，無法找得結婚的對象。據最近東京市社會局的調查，光是東京市内，就有二十萬名。這些妙齡的少女，因無法出嫁，祇得流浪街頭，找尋職業，但那有許多現成的位置來安插這些待嫁女郎呢？</p>
<p>馬車複現</p>
<p>汽油，是戰時的重要燃料，貧乏的日本，自然視為珍品，不肯再有點滴的浪费了。所以最近的東京市上汽車已很寥落，並且大多用木炭來做代用品，而在東京市上絕跡了數十年的馬車，却重又出現了，用以替代汽車和運貨車，彷彿已回復到明治初年時代。假使戰事不停，馬車將氾濫於日本國內，倒是必然的事實。</p>
<p>革除領袖</p>
<p>紡織品缺乏的結果，將使日本的服裝，來一次改變。不久，日本婦女的新裝，須一律加以剪短，這是政府的命令。以後，日本少女將穿起沒有「領」和「袖」的時裝，她們的內衣，將剪短刀驚人的程度。這樣「別緻」的裝束，到時東京市上的一種特殊點綴。</p>
<p>嬰兒減少</p>
<p>在日本眾議院會議席上，政友會議員伊東岩男對廣瀨厚生大臣的質問中，有一條是對日本嬰兒生產率減少，表示焦慮，要求政府說明對策。據廣瀨的答復，在這一次的侵略戰中，嬰兒的生產率，的確「相當」減少。平時「每年近二百萬的生產，恐怕減少了三四十萬」。這還是所謂官廳的報告，實際數目，當不至此。並且，人民因生活艱難，乳兒和幼兒死亡率，也較平時為大，這倒是個嚴重的社會問題。</p>
<p>「快樂的，櫻花一樣的日本，是消逝了，悲哀的暗影，籠罩着每一寸土地，每個人心上滴下了憂　的淚痕」！佐野碩這幾句話，正式確切的描寫。</p>
<h3>安全運動</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>不斷的因不小心而引起的車輛肇禍事件，正是全美國現在最嚴重的一個問题。為减少其數目計，余已仟命秘書羅柏與參議員摩亞，共同組織一委員會，以從事保障全國生命與財產的研究。</p>
<p>很幸運，由於廣大的用文字與他種方法來散播因駕駛卤莽而造成的各種恐怖的緣故，無數汽車夫，现在都很知道這一個事實了；對他們．余希望甚殷，蓋欲解決此項嚴重問題，務必依賴全體駕駛員之力量也。</p>
<p>但願吾們的生命，自今以後，將因此而比較安全。要光我們每一個人，每一個家庭都在走路，或者駕駛車子的時候小心，留意，不鹵莽，則成千成萬的人，是準不會枉死在車輪底下的。</p>
<p>美國總統羅斯福，在一九三八年的兀旦日，因鑒於車輛肇禍事件的日增，所以，特地發表了上面這一段談話；其用意，當然就是要想促引每一個人民的注意與小心，用集體的力量來减少此項不幸的死亡的人數。當時候，並且還在一本名叫「讀者文摘」的雜誌上，刊載了一篇「-而暴卒」的文章，文中對造成「車輛肇禍」這一個嚴重的問題的各項原因，分析得極詳細而透澈，果真，全個美國的民眾的注意方向，就都因此而集中到「車輛肇禍事件」上来。不消說得，由於以往的事實的證明，美國的這一個安全運動是得到了成功的。</p>
<p>現在，上海工部局的車務處處長培格E．O.Baker，有見於上海去年度車禍肇事事件的突然增加（據報載，死傷共計有八千七百二十九人之多，打破了歷來的紀祿）也想發起一種安全運動，定名為「安全週」；其目的，其用意，與上面所說到的羅斯福總統進行的一種，正可謂是事出一轍，無獨有偶。無論從每個上海市民的生命上看來，或者從整個社會的福利的觀點卜看，這一個安全運動，的確是值得我们來提倡，來竭力推行的。為什麼由於他人的不小心的緣故，我們竟要枉死在車輪底下呢，又為什麼因為一時偶然不留意，我們竞要將一個無怨無仇的親爱的同胞，無緣無故地來碾死呢？</p>
<p>在事實上，現在的問題，倒並不是在於我們的不知道對「車輛肇禍事件」應該怎樣做，而是在我們的能不能够集中了我們的精神心思，去做我們所知道的一切方法與預防策。美國的國民安全院ational　Safety　Cuoncil,就謂;「假使我們每一個人都應用所知的一切來阻止車輛肇事，則此種枉的命案，将準可以减低百分之五十。「所以，每一個上海市的市民呵，如果你要想你的生命可以安全，你就得努力做各項能够阻止車輛肇禍的方法，也就是，你必須要來盡全力地去贊助，去推行這一個安全運動。</p>
<p>其次，在教育方面，我們也一定要儘量地去宣傳「小心」的主要，碾死的恐怖，以及各種「安全」的觀念，那末，安全運動的收效，也將随着宏大，是毫無疑地的。此外，如組織「安全巡查隊」，嚴厲執行交通規律，嚴格舉行車輛駕駛員的考試，改進紅綠燈，增設路燈.....等等，也都是值得我們注意的。總之，以全體市民力量來舉行這個安全運動，我們是一定會使我們的生命得到「安全」的保障的。</p>
<h3>「紅粉飄零」觀感</h3>
<p>— 思敬</p>
<p>「紅粉飄零」是一個非常熟稔的故事，這故事或許正發生在我們的身邊：一個嬌養成性的千金小姐，因為家庭的突變，她被逼着定向墮落之路，最後，彷彿池子裏冒起的一個泡沫那樣，悄悄地結束了她的生命，和她沒有來到這個世界一樣。你能否認這不是正發生在我們身邊的故事嗎？但是當這些可憐的生命脫離這世界的時後，我們試看一看屹立在她周遭的人們，（連殺她的劊子手也在裏面）有的喟嘆着，有的作怕人的冷笑，而那殺人的劊子手呢，他是頭也不回一回地走了，於是，其他的人都像看完了什麼热鬧一樣，走了，他們是跟在先走的人的後面，去看第二的「熱鬧」發生，以至於無數次。看完了「紅粉飄零」以後，我有加上面同樣的感覺，它祇是概念地告訴觀眾是這樣一個故事，而沒有指出造成這樣故事的黑暗面，讓人們看一看他們所從来沒有看到的東西，而使喟嘆的人感到自己的懦弱：使冷笑的感到自己的殘酷，而憤怒：那劊子手呢，至少是以後再不能看見他们的影子了。</p>
<p>所以，「紅粉飄零」最大的缺點是缺乏積極性。第一：如趙珍妮這角色，她是無疑的是代表着進步女性的，但是在學校裏見了他一面之後，一直到路明做舞女以後才出現，而這僅僅的一露面，又是那樣地脆弱啊！</p>
<p>第二：　稼農的摧殘華紗市場，祗用一封信來表明是不够的。從他參與路明生日宴會出場起，我們更多意識到他是個對路明有非分之想的僞紳士。</p>
<p>真的，如果一方面能强調一下代表前准女性的趙珍妮，對比的地去襯托路明的墜落：一方面能够更清楚寫出外來資本的壓迫民族資本，那麼，這個劇本一定會很有意義的。</p>
<h3>黃花崗（大鼓書）</h3>
<p>— 貽白</p>
<p>大鼓書本有兩種：一種是長篇，叫「蔓子活」，一種是短幅，叫「段兒書」，又叫「唱片」。今之落子館所唱者皆為「唱片」，亦即從長篇摘取下來。如紅樓夢原有十三段，千金全德原有八段，費宫人刺虎原有四段，皆其顯例。本篇雖未分段，但以　生才事為引子，黄花崗事為正文，篇幅較長，即職是故。至於史料方面，承阿英兄借給我粤亂彙編一書，使我不至今逞臆測，附此感謝。雖然人世有滄桑，天道由來沒準常，肯為蒼生謀幸福，不妨一已受災殃。憂時漫揾英雄淚，幾句俚詞弔國殤，喪的是清代末年朝政腐敗，太后垂簾亂了主張，眾朝臣奴顏婢膝忘廉恥，全不想三百年來民族淪亡。有四個明理之士略加大體，也只是懷疑帝制要把維新侣，人心不皆主見更不一，一面維新一面要保皇。事機不密塌不密太后知道了，一道諭旨六君子遭了殃。內政不修內政不發生了外侮，義和拳依勢凌人氣燄張。八國。八圃聯軍把北京攻破，頤和園做了他人的牧馬場。中華民族聚奇恥，這才使爱國英雄燃起無名火地名火一腔。</p>
<p>在那時提起此人皆喪胆，與中會的首領孫中山。中山。多年來奔走革命無成就，因遭追捕在外流亡。目擊時艱　能袖手，急忙忙召集同志作商量。他說：「清空君臣早已是神遊墟墓，趁這屍居道烧居餘氣同心光復漢河山」。會議畢，史堅　奉派如珍汲潛入廣東省，惠州城起事派了鄭士良。又誰知後援不繼俱遭失敗，史堅如喪命鄭氏逃亡。孫中山再接再厲之不氣餒，因此上演出這悲壯的史劇黄花崗。</p>
<p>那時候保皇勢力還存在，維新黨碩果猶存唐才常。最可嘆武漢舉兵遭擒被戮，在安徽連累了一個秦力山。從此後革命黨人犧牲越大，犧牲越大意志也越強。看看到了辛亥歲，革命的努力漸漸仲張。春光明媚正是三月初十，廣州城出了驚人事一樁。孚琦將軍兼任廣州都統一，為着看飛大排隊伍到燕塘，看罷飛機回督署，剛走到　議局前正待轉灣。只聽得人　裏面一聲大喊，說：「狗官往那裏走」！衝出一人身體不長，手執短槍朝橋裏追放，砰然幾響孚琦受了傷，護衛的兵士雖有數十，槍聲一響大家都着了忙，不顧將軍各自走避，抬轎的丢了轎子走他娘。那好漢横衝直撞如入無人境，又朝孚琦放了一槍，請他見閻王。紛亂中　了短槍揚長而去，又誰知一個巡士暗跟隨，永勝街遇了河南偵探隊，這才拿獲了好漢押在營房。三司大審把口供逼拷，那好漢身　鐵鍊態度安詳。他說：「我叫　生才順德人也。你們這班衣冠禽獸問什麼短和長。我初意本想打死一隻虎，那知道錯認鹵簿宰了一條羊。也罷，我為民族復仇殺了此賊，做一戒百你們都得把公當。你問我黨徒有多少，那真是成千累萬人海茫茫。我瞧你們也都是黄帝子孫堂堂華胄，為什麼甘心媚敵為虎作倀？殺了我罷！讓你們邀功得赏升官職。哈哈！往後的日子你們可要小心提防」。溫生才慷慨赴義毫無懼色，受刑不把別人攀。三月十六奉諭旨，十七日毅然就戮赴刑場。在中途一面呵呵張口笑，神色自若容止如常；一而還把同胞勸，勸同胞要替漢族來爭光。大砲一聲人頭落地，溫烈士，今日傳來姓字香。（上）</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第六回　誇人瑞一苗挺三秀　敘友情二士會羣英</p>
<p>有些幼稚生，離開已經八九年了，他們所種的樹，不但長過了人，而且蔚然成林。有的却還是纔種的樹，剛發出嫩芽幼枝，可是童年的性情，自巳種的樹，都願意自己來看看。章院長因此每年在五六月樹木茂盛的時節，她要開一個聯歡會。召集在本院出去的幼稚生，和他們的家長，到院中歡叙一天。備了各種茶點，就在園中樹蔭之下，或是唱歌，或是遊戲。將已出院的老幼稚生，和未出院的新幼稚生，大家親愛的如同哥弟姊妹一般。對於自己所植的樹，看了它欣欣向榮，真覺得依依不忍別咧。今年開聯歡會時，也是一位所謂老幼稚生者，他是產生於，這裏婦孺醫院的。他是一個孤兒，父親早故世了，母親也身體不大健全，因此他也是寄養在育婴院，在幼稚園當過幼稚生的。如今他已是初中二年級生了，種的是一棵梧，也非常之高。大家公推他演說。他演說中，有幾句话，雖然有點稚氣，却非常感動人。他說：「我今年十四歲，似乎已脫離幼稚園的生活了。但我還是很羨慕小弟弟小妹妹們的快樂，可惜我不能縮小身體，和他們一樣大。這聯歡會可惜只有一天，要育一星期多好。但我今後無論如何，每年必來。我要到我產生的房子裏去坐坐，我要到我種的樹底下夫望望。我每年必來，一直到我的頭髮白了，我還是本院一個老幼稚生，我算是小弟弟小妹妹中的一位老哥哥「老章醫師聽了，也非常感動，握了他的手，只是不放咧。如今因為是秋高氣爽的時候，不宜戶外運動。雖然他們是分為四組，却仍在一宅中，有時唱歌游戲，又併在一起。這屋子中，都是特製的小桌子，小椅子．每一個保姆，管理一組。衣服也是一樣的，小弟弟穿的衣服是黑的，男小孩子的衣服；小妹妹穿的衣服是白的，女小孩子的衣服。今天童海嬰女士，聽得何宗兩位小妞跟了朱愛人同來參觀幼稚園，她們親來招待．她要那些幼稚生向何家兩位小姐鞠躬行禮，她又自己彈着風琴，選擇小妹妹中，有趣位唱歌唱得好的，唱得兩位小姐聽。正是</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>在整個火藥氣瀰漫的世界中　好萊塢戰事片白熱化——出租軍器者大發其財——</h3>
<p>— 呆子</p>
<p>西班牙戰事沒有結束，中日的戰事還在進展着，捷克這歐洲的火藥庫又要爆裂了。整個世界充滿了火藥氣味的環境之中，好萊塢的影片公司，最近正在競攝戰事鉅片。</p>
<p>在影城之中，近來多數的攝影塲裏，有着刀槍的聲響，呈現出軍事緊張的情狀。女明星，服睛上塗了薄荷腦，這樣，男主角出征的時候，在笑容之中，眼淚會很自然的流落下來，每一部戰事片，都是這樣</p>
<p>現在，好萊塢是在攝製所有能攝的戰片。等到派拉蒙的Invasion一片攝成之後，甚至可使我們發現一種暴露掠奪的影片。</p>
<p>當葛列斐斯拍攝The　Birth　of　a　Nation　一片時，為了戰事的鏡頭，會耗去不少費用。但現在各公司所攝的戰片，比那時所付的費用還要多。臨時的軍人，每天拍戲的代價，是美金十元五角，租借槍械，每千枝租費五十元。</p>
<p>在柴納克的攝影塲裏，「乘風歸去」（Gone　WithThe　Wind）一片的黑夜戰爭的鏡頭，早已在開拍了·火燒亞特蘭特的一幕，是非常偉大。而這些戰爭的鏡頭，都是用導演的手法拍攝，內中有一部分，是非常壯麗的。</p>
<p>好萊塢有一位斯丹保琪，藏有不少軍械，就在派拉蒙影片公司裏面，他也收藏着不少所有自古以來的軍器。各影片公司攝製戰事片需要軍器時，就向他出租金租借。最近需要激增，他就大發其財·</p>
<p>因為最近各公司的競攝戰事片，斯丹保琪的出租軍器，就大忙而特忙起來。HotelImperial　一片中，需要二百五十校奧國式來福槍，而所需的俄國式步槍，也同樣的多。他同時還在這些槍裹，裝好無彈火藥，彈壳的裹面，裝着黑色而發火的彈藥，它們在白天或夜晚拍戲應用是不同的·</p>
<p>甚至在Union　Pacifi　c一片中，雖然並不是眞正的戰事片，佐麥蓋和他所率領的人抵擋印第安人的暴動時，用了二百十枝來福槍；而那些暴徒，為的拿着一八六三年時的舊式步檢而蒙不利。同樣，在Heritage　of　the　Desert　一片中，有一個鏡頭，用五十枝步槍。</p>
<p>斯丹保琪最大的一筆生意，那是要供給幾百枝斯賓斐爾特式新槍和所有收藏的機關槍。但高射砲和重砲發生了問題，政府方面，或可帮忙；可是一部分軍器，至少要由影片公司設計，雖然不是正式作戰，也要使人獲得深刻的印象。華納開拍Juarez一片時，戰爭的鏡頭，將在勃爾彭地方拍攝，他們有四百枝老式步槍，和若干新式槍，已够作此片的背景了。</p>
<p>由埃洛弗林主演的「道奇城」（Dodge　City）一片，需要一百枝笨重的舊式槍，和若干短口徑手槍。但所有的不到此數，所以一般臨時演員的不是實地作戰者，都拿橡膠製的假槍。</p>
<p>斯丹保琪的軍械庫中，所有英國製李曼爾福式槍，一共有叫百六十枝，最近每天在用卡車裝到雷電華去，為的要開拍Gunga　Din一片。從今而後，同樣的槍，還要忙着修理好，預備供給The　Light　That　Failed一片中所有戰爭的鏡頭拍攝時取用。</p>
<h3>卓別林五十歲小誌</h3>
<p>— 陸德綱</p>
<p>銀幕幽默大師卓別林今年已是五十歲了。他生於一八八九年四月十六日別士頓（Brixton）地方，父親是常地一個略具小名的舞台歌唱員，死時很早，身後很蕭條，全靠卓別林的母親辛勤過日，縐把卓別林和他的一個小兄弟扶養長大。到了十四歲那年，卓別林便在「福爾摩斯」一劇中擔任一個起　角色，十七歲時，他加入加爾拿劇團中任丑角，後來經人介紹，轉入另一戲班中，往新大陸去演戲。到了美國不久，他便被開士頓電影公司聘去充演員，從此以後，他便靑雲直上，身名一天響如一天。總計他成名後的片子，幾乎無一張不賣滿座，卓別林所以能如此吸收觀衆，並不是他的命運好，也不是靠他的破靴和手杖而是完全靠他出類抜萃的藝術天才和刻苦的訓練。</p>
<p>為了紀念這位大藝人五十壽辰，全美國都將舉行宴會以誌慶祝，同時各地電影院都將專映一星期關於卓氏一生所攝的片子，所以近來各製片公司都日夜拷貝卓氏的舊片以便運往各地放映，卓氏有此光榮，也足以自豪了！</p>
<h3>王獻齋夫婦同進新華</h3>
<p>— 銀絲</p>
<p>明星一度情商發生波折　新華仍許今後隨時借用</p>
<p>王獻齊，近自川滇回滬未久，便似成為電影界的新獵物一般，頓時引起各公司競謀羅致，爭聘不下。因為，他是反派角色特一無二的優特人才，眞是「物稀為貴」，大家都很需要。新華公司當由韓蘭根代表往洽，首即談妥合同條件。同時，明星公司方面，則以多年老賓主關係，又非堅請仍回老家不可。以致王獻齋左右為難，為之大感躊躇。明星鑒此僵持情形，因即挽請華成公司營業主任卞毓英氏代向新華情商，請予讓歸明星聘用。新華亦經接受要求，用以表示顧全同業情誼的了。後來，明星方面得知王獻齋彼時已將合同簽就，送交新華；因而不欲於此已成事實，使其毀棄，終於仍向新華表示自願讓與新華公司。新華當局至此始與王獻齋簽定合同作為解決。而王亦即確定出路，就此隸於新華陣營了。惟在明星方面，今後如果需用王獻齊拍戲，新華仍可隨時借用，藉重友誼。因是得此結果，大家都覺甚為滿意。同時，王夫人袁竹如，現亦簽定長的，和他同進新華了。</p>

<p>閣世善剛健婀娜　楊寳森歌喉嘹亮</p>
<p>避秦孤島，悶損萬端，偶入歌塲，亦借酒澆愁長歌當哭之意耳，日前荷友人邀作黃金之遊，至則寶森之罵曹正出塲，引子定塲白，平妥無疵，咬字勁潔，流水及二方味純路正，擊鼓堪稱一絕，寳森寳忠均以擊鼓為現時老生行之瑜亮，腕子之靈活，點子之乾脆，雖叔岩富英恐亦自嘆弗如，前觀管紹華演此，誠自鄶以下不足論矣，寳森若能對於面部表情，及扎靠戲多加揣摩，則繼叔岩之後，識者可勿作第二人想矣，嘗一度觀共與章遏雲演探母，於哭堂別家，延輝仲起左足作出門狀，照例應由六郎（貫盛習飾）跪而托其足，以示不忍其去，方顯手足情緒，乃寳森仲足，六郎望望然却之，似欲理而不理，實森只得伸而旋縮，不獨親此者心中為之不快，即演者本身，亦定有異感也，盛習碩大聲洪，裏子老生之翹楚，希勿染有驕氣，致礙進步，駡曹後即金山寺，閻世善飾水漫之白蛇，水戰之唱念及開打出手，無一不令人呌絕，聞此戲係由其大伯九陣風親授，興蘭芳所演者同一路，而扮相之英媚，身段之矯捷，蹺工之穩健，今日之旦行中，殆無出其右者矣，世善能戲甚多，如扈家莊女殺四門等，者番尙米見其露演，希黃金當軸，能逐一為之排演，而飽滬人眼福也。遏雲接演斷橋祭塔，按斷橋原屬崑戲，而遏雲以亂彈出之，未免减色，盛蘭能崑，是夕竟不能展共長，殊令人失望矣。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一三一）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>華容道釋曹的主因</p>
<p>華容道是在派（大頭）名劇，亦為紅生與凈角對唱對白的重頭戲，大頭故後，王鳳卿亦時常貼演。海上唱紅臉戲的，多宗三麻子（王鴻壽）一派。二十年前，上海有一個人以演關劇出名的，除王以活關公享盛名外，尙有夏月潤與趙如泉二人。趙氏演劇，有時太覺隨便，遂致有滑頭關公之稱。三麻子因係徽班出身，無論唱作，俱有深切研究，其絕唱如「斬經堂」，「掃松下書」，「徐災跑城」，「雪擁藍關」等，至今留為後人楷模，如麒麟寓，林樹森諸人，都是以王為法的。王氏天生鳳眼，扮裝後先有幾分威嚴，况他平時祀奉關帝甚虔，每逢貼演關劇之前夕，必齋戒沐浴，焚香叩拜·翌日至後臺扮戲，亦於室中焚檀香，頂禮後，開始扮戲，從此時起，即不復與任何人談話，結束登塲之前，高坐椅上，凡該劇中各配角如周倉，關平等均向其叩拜，自視即為劇中人矣。因他以十分精誠揣摹關羽的為人，用全副精神灌注在表，作，唸，唱，所以他演出關戲來，自然是高於一切而無愧於這個活關公的綽號了。他故世以後，林樹森金少山曾合演過「華容道」的唱片，二人對唱的流水板，備極動聽，因此遂把這齣戲宣揚開啦。</p>
<p>很奇怪的一個問題，就是孔明旣然明知曹操兵敗後要走華容小道，隨便差遣一員將官就好把漏網之魚的阿瞞擒來，然而他却偏要讓英勇無敵的關雲長自討令箭，立下軍狀，去將强敵放走，致使後來有逼宮謀纂的種種怪劇演出，炎漢四百年基業，卒被曹氏攘奪了去，這不是顯見得諸葛先生太拿着劉氏江山開玩笑麼？其實這裏面却有個大道理存乎其間，多少年來不但是看「華容道」這齣戲的人，沒有猜透，就是熟讀三國的人，也不曾料到，不妄也是聽一位老戲迷說的，究竟對與不對，待我寫了出來，再請高明批評指示吧。</p>

<h3>Fierce Fighting Near Nanchang; Chinese Troops Counterattack Anyi with Smooth Progress; Advancing Towards the County Seat After Occupying Phoenix Mountain, Tiger Mountain, and Chenjia; Japanese Led by a Large Number of Armored Vehicles, Many of Which Were Destroyed</h3>
<p>Tung Hsiang: The Chinese troops counterattacking Anyi are making smooth progress. On the 26th, they occupied the line of Phoenix Mountain (4 kilometers east of Anyi), Tiger Mountain (19 kilometers southeast of Anyi), and Chenjia (13 kilometers southeast of Anyi), and are now advancing towards Anyi County. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the main force of the Japanese army on the left flank of the Chinese army, led by 20 tanks, launched an offensive from Fengxin towards the southeast of Nanchang. Its vanguard has cut off the highway west of Nanchang and reached Wanshougong and Wubu. The Chinese defenders of Nanchang launched a desperate attack on the Japanese positions, so there is fierce fighting in the western suburbs of Nanchang. In this battle, the Chinese army destroyed 6 Japanese tanks and shot down 1 Japanese aircraft. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xiushui: Fierce fighting, the only one comparable to the Wuhan campaign since then, has broken out between Chinese and Japanese forces in the area of Wanjiabu, Lehua, and Wanshougong outside Nanchang. Two Japanese regiments, led by more than 20 tanks and under the cover of 40 to 50 Japanese aircraft bombing in separate directions, advanced in two routes. One route was along the ancient road from Fengxin, and the other route was from Wanjiabu, attempting to converge on Nanchang. They were resolutely resisted by Chinese troops under the command of a certain commander. As of the evening of the 27th, Chinese and Japanese forces were still engaged in fierce fighting in places like Dianqiangjie and Songbu. The Japanese themselves admitted that the battle outside Nanchang was comparable to the Battle of the 森堡 in the European war, with heavy casualties, which is already generally apparent. In addition, the offensive of the Japanese troops who attacked Luopingdongkou east of Wuning was weakened after being blocked by the Chinese army. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tung Hsiang: On the morning of the 26th, 3 Japanese tanks and more than 1,000 infantrymen advanced towards Nanchang from the southern urban area of Tujiabu. One tank fell into the river en route, and two tanks rushed to Niuhang Station, exchanging artillery fire with the Chinese army across the river. By noon, the number of Japanese tanks had increased to 13. After the Chinese artillery aimed and fired, 6 of them were destroyed. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: On the 24th, the Japanese army from Nanxun launched a fierce attack on Malukou (50 li northwest of Nanchang), engaging in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. The main force of the Japanese army arrived in Anyi on the 24th and infiltrated Fengxin. About 300 to 400 Japanese soldiers and 4 tanks are currently showing no unusual movements. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tung Hsiang: After the Japanese tanks that rushed to Niuhang Station this afternoon were repelled by the Chinese army, the Japanese sent 13 more tanks, accompanied by more than 1,000 infantry and cavalry, to attack Niuhang Station again. The Chinese defenders on the south bank used dense artillery fire to bombard the Japanese army. Six or seven Japanese tanks were hit and set on fire. The Japanese army also returned fire with artillery. Both sides are still engaged in fierce artillery fire across the Gan River. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to a Tung Hsiang dispatch of the 26th, a major battle is unfolding around Nanchang. On the night of the 25th, 500 to 600 Japanese soldiers from Wucheng advanced to Lao Quegong (50 kilometers northeast of Nanchang). At the same time, Japanese troops were spotted in Zigu (33 kilometers north of Nanchang), but in very small numbers. More than 1,000 Japanese soldiers and more than 20 tanks were also spotted in Wanshougong and Wushanpu (30 kilometers from Nanchang). There were also more than 1,000 Japanese troops near Songbu (10 kilometers south of Anyi), who are currently being intercepted by Chinese troops in separate locations. (Special dispatch, 10:00 PM on the 27th)</p>
<p>Fengcheng: The Japanese troops who rushed from Wanshougong and Wushanpu to the north bank of the Gan River engaged in fierce artillery fire with the Chinese defenders of Nanchang in the afternoon of the 26th. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>Tung Hsiang: A unit of Japanese troops from Wushan Town infiltrated Shengmi Street (13 kilometers west of Nanchang), and another unit infiltrated Xinzhou (17 kilometers southwest of Nanchang), attempting to forcibly cross the Gan River. They are currently facing off against the Chinese army. (27th dispatch)</p>
<p>Guilin: At 9:00 PM on the 25th, Japanese company commander Lieutenant Urujima Takeo and deputy company commander Lieutenant Minamoto Sachio were killed by the Chinese army in Chenzhuang, northeast of Wuning. (27th dispatch) The Japanese troops advancing east along the Xianggan Highway used a large amount of poison gas against the Chinese defenders, and many Chinese soldiers were poisoned. This afternoon, the Japanese troops took the opportunity to invade Wushiqiao and continued to rush forward using tanks, advancing to Niuhang Station at one point. The Chinese army bravely fought back and repelled the Japanese army. Fierce fighting is currently underway in the Wushiqiao area. (26th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Since the 20th, Tujiabu has been subjected to day and night bombing by Japanese aircraft and artillery. The Chinese army fought bravely and inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army repeatedly. However, due to the complete destruction of the fortifications, it was transferred to the south bank of the Xiu River yesterday morning to firmly defend Fengxin. Yesterday afternoon, a unit of about 300 Japanese soldiers and 13 tanks once sneaked to the west bank of the Gan River. After a fierce counterattack by the Chinese army, 6 Japanese tanks were destroyed and many Japanese soldiers were killed. The remaining Japanese troops fled westward.

<h3>Lessons from the Soviet-Japanese Fishery Negotiations</h3>
<p>The fishery negotiations between the Soviet Union and Japan have been dragging on for nearly half a year since they were initiated by Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union Togo and Litvinov in October last year. Dozens of meetings have been held without any result. The area of fishery dispute between the Soviet Union and Japan is the fishery area in the Soviet territorial waters of the Sea of Japan, the Bering Sea, and the Sea of Okhotsk. According to the Treaty of Portsmouth after the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, Imperial Russia allowed Japan to fish in the aforementioned locations along the coast. This is the source of Japan's so-called "treaty-based" rights, and the only basis for Japan's so-called willingness to gamble its national fortune on fishing rights. For thirty years, Japan has taken the opportunity to develop its ambitions under the pretext of treaty provisions. During the October Revolution in the Soviet Union, Japan once occupied the northern sea fishing area by force. Although the occupied fishing area was later taken back by the Soviet Union, Japan's fishing encroachment has occurred almost every year.</p>
<p>The initial establishment of the Soviet-Japanese fishery agreement was in 1905, and it was supplemented in 1928. It expired in 1936. Before the expiration, Japan requested a renewal and revision. As a result, the Soviet Union allowed a one-year extension, temporarily allowing Japan to fish in the specified three hundred and several fishing grounds and to be exempt from the Soviet bidding methods. By the end of last year, the date of the expiration of the extension had arrived again, and Japan of course still hoped that the Soviet Union would continue to grant it. However, the Soviet Union recently not only saw through Japan's insatiable ambitions, but also discovered that Japan had taken advantage of the convenience of the aforementioned fishing grounds to engage in activities within Soviet territorial waters that were detrimental to Soviet national defense. Therefore, the Soviet Union resolutely advocated the recovery of more than 40 fishing grounds related to national defense. At the same time, in view of Japan's overdue payment of the Chinese Eastern Railway debt, the Soviet Union made Japan's repayment of the 6 million yuan Chinese Eastern Railway debt a prerequisite.</p>
<p>Since the start of negotiations last year, the Japanese authorities have repeatedly issued threatening remarks, but the Soviet Union has insisted on its original position and has not been shaken. On the 15th of this month, during the suspension of negotiations between the two sides, the Soviet Union resolutely auctioned off 300 and several fishing grounds. Four of them have already been auctioned, all of which were obtained by Soviet businessmen. It was also decided to hold the second auction on April 3. After the news of the initial auction was released, Japanese Foreign Minister Arita made a statement, stating that Japan did not participate in this auction and could not recognize the Japanese interests if any of the four auctioned fishing areas were involved, and declared that the Soviet Union should bear the responsibility for the incident. However, the world's public opinion believes that this claim by Japan is purely a bluff. In the 20th month of the war against China, Japan has no way to maintain the current situation, so how dare it challenge the Soviet Union, which has been recuperating for 20 years!</p>
<p>Sure enough, two days after Arita's statement, because the Soviet Union was unmoved, he then made a statement, stating that Japan was willing to automatically participate in the second auction of fishing grounds. In today's newspaper dispatch, it is also reported that the end of negotiations between the two countries may not be far away. Although we do not know the details of Japan's participation in this auction, it is already very clear that this time Japan must yield due to its internal weakness.</p>
<p>The course of this fact has indeed given China, which is in the war of resistance, a major lesson. First, Japan's yielding shows that China's war of resistance has indeed weakened Japan's strength, making it outwardly strong but inwardly weak. As long as China can continue the war of resistance, the date of victory is in sight. Second, Japan's yielding to the Soviet Union shows that only a firm and tough foreign policy can deliver a head-on blow to the aggressor. Therefore, to defeat Japan and stabilize the order in the Far East, China must resolutely resist, and other countries must use effective sanctions!</p>

After offsetting the two, the inflow of foreign capital into the United States totaled $26,758,000. In that year, deposits from South American countries in U.S. banks totaled $18,005,000, and deposits from Far Eastern countries totaled $77,082,000. Further analysis of the funds flowing into the United States still shows that the most came from Europe, totaling $388,655,000, but this is far less than in previous years. In 1935, the inflow totaled $1,200,598,000; in 1936, the inflow totaled $850,714,000; in 1937, the inflow totaled $601,727,000; and last year it dropped to $388,655,000. Year after year, the inflow of funds from various countries into the United States has been as regular as the tide. Since the global economic panic, from January 1, 1935, the total amount of foreign capital flowing into the United States has reached a huge $3,779,225,000. (26th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Continued Fighting in the Donghai Area of Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: The focus of the war in Northern Jiangsu has gradually shifted to the Donghai and Shuyang areas. Although County Magistrate Zhu Aizhou led his team to resist in Shuyang County, Japanese reinforcements continued to arrive at Fangshan, southwest of Donghai. Fierce fighting has broken out in the Fangshan area. At the same time, 200 Japanese soldiers attempted to surround the Chinese army in Cangmafang, Shuyang. Both sides fought fiercely all day. The brave Chinese soldiers repeatedly charged and fought heroically, eventually annihilating all the Japanese soldiers. The houses in the western street of Cangmafang were completely reduced to ashes after being continuously bombarded by the Japanese army with artillery.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Recaptures Shangxingbu; the Entire City Has Been Burned Down by the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Lishui Correspondence: On the 20th, the Central Jiangsu guerrillas advanced into Lishui County. A fierce battle took place between Lishui and Tianwang Temple with the Japanese Morita unit. As a result, the Japanese army was defeated and fled back to Tianwang Temple. All bridges on the highway five miles west of Lishui were destroyed by the Chinese mobile team. Shangxingbu has been recovered by the Chinese army. Shangxingbu was originally the most prosperous commercial area in Liyi. Lishui was lost and suffered no losses. Since it was occupied by the Japanese army, it has been wantonly ravaged, and the tragic scene can be seen everywhere. Before leaving, the Japanese army set fire to Shangxingbu, and all the houses in the city were reduced to ashes. All villages, large and small, within five miles of the highway were also burned down. As many as 40 innocent men and women were killed. The guerrillas have attacked Huangchi Town, which belongs to Gaochun County, and are fiercely fighting with the Japanese army there.</p>

<h3>Poland's Ambition Towards Germany Still on Military Alert; Germany Denies Making Demands on Poland; Switzerland Also Increases Defense on Border</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Military preparations here are still actively underway, but in great secrecy. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw: The rumor that Germany has made demands on Poland cannot be confirmed. However, it is generally believed that Poland has made military preparations because it believes that Germany may exert pressure to modify the Danzig situation. It is said that Poland is determined to take precautions to avoid being caught off guard. It is also said that Poland firmly opposes any concessions in the Polish Corridor. Recently, someone said that Germany may propose building a German highway through the Polish Corridor. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the right-wing newspaper London News, Germany sent a note to the Polish government on the 24th of this month, asserting that the issue of the Free City of Danzig should be resolved directly by Germany and Poland, without regard to the solution proposed by the League of Nations: (1) Germany should be allowed to enjoy certain rights in the city of Danzig; (2) The position of Polish High Commissioner should be abolished immediately; (3) The port of Danzig should still be used by Poland. (27th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) According to the News Chronicle, Hitler presented a note to Poland, containing three points, demanding the virtual restoration of all German rights in the Free City of Danzig. The three points he requested are as follows: (1) Abolish the position of League of Nations Commissioner in Danzig; (2) Germany and Poland should effectively resolve the Danzig issue; (3) All rights in Danzig, except for certain port rights of the Polish side, should belong to Germany. (26th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Yesterday, it was widely rumored that Germany had sent three notes to Poland one after another last week, demanding the return of the Free City of Danzig and the city of Otterburg, and allowing Germany to build a highway through the Polish Corridor to connect the German province of West Silesia with East Prussia. Germany will gather troops on the southern Swiss border. All these rumors have been dismissed as inaccurate by people who are unable to obtain reliable information here. (27th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital: In order to be prepared, Switzerland has strengthened its border defenses and has issued orders to lay landmines to protect important locations such as highway bridges on the border. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Swiss Capital: The Federal Council held a meeting this morning to discuss the international situation. It unanimously believed that the international situation has eased considerably, but it is regrettable that there are still rumors of German troops concentrating on the Swiss border. However, it was still decided that the training period for border troops and reservists (a portion of which was mobilized in January this year) and staff should be extended by two weeks, and officers and junior officers should also be retrained.

<p>(London) Undersecretary Butler stated in the House of Commons today, guaranteeing that the recent changes in the international situation do not involve economic retaliation measures against Germany. (27th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Britain Still Attaches Great Importance to Romania; Trade Mission to Depart Soon</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons this afternoon, "After the Romanian government signed a supplementary commercial agreement with Germany, it notified the British government of the content and stated that the agreement did not contain any provisions of a political nature or sacrifice Romania's economic independence. In addition, the British government has always attached importance to promoting trade between Britain and Romania and promoting bilateral economic relations. What I should state is that the British government had already decided to send a trade mission to that country. Since the Romanian government has expressed its hope that the trade mission can depart as soon as possible, the British government is willing to comply." (27th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) Romanian Prime Minister Calinescu made a statement to a Paris Evening Post interviewer yesterday, stating, "One thing has been determined, that is, if Romania is attacked, no matter which country the aggressor belongs to, it should rise up to defend itself and use all its strength to maintain its territorial integrity. The commercial agreement recently concluded between Romania and Germany began negotiations in February of this year and is not related to the recent events in the international community. Romania's existing or future commercial relations with other countries will not be affected as a result." (26th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany Also Has Intentions Towards Yugoslavia; Seeks Commercial Rights</h3>
<p>(Paris) The fact that three German deputies in the Yugoslav parliament were summoned to Berlin has sparked much discussion among political and diplomatic circles here. It is said that Germany has made commercial proposals to Yugoslavia, seeking to include the Yugoslav market within Germany's "area of vital concern." This measure directly conflicts with Italy's interests. Back when the Rome-Berlin Axis was formed (October 1936), the two sides divided their spheres of influence in the Danube region. Austria and Czechoslovakia were assigned to German control, while Romania and Yugoslavia were assigned to Italian control. Hungary was a joint sphere of influence of both Italy and Germany. The outline of this division was confirmed during Prime Minister Mussolini's visit to Germany in 1937. Subsequently, Austria and Czechoslovakia were either incorporated into Germany as provinces or became German protectorates. Romania was also forced to sign a commercial agreement with Germany, granting it huge economic benefits. As a result, Italy had to buy oil from the Soviet Union and, in order to recover the price, disregarded the fact that the Soviet Union was the target of the Anti-Comintern Pact and built warships for it. Now that Germany is expanding its influence to Yugoslavia, Prime Minister Mussolini must have realized this and, finding it unbearable, clearly declared in his speech yesterday that Italy's interests in the Adriatic Sea should be in a superior position. Until 1932, Italy regarded Yugoslavia as a formidable neighbor, with a coastline that was winding and everywhere a natural barrier for the navy, which could not be compared with Italy's flat and unsheltered coastline. In 1937, it signed a treaty of friendship with Yugoslavia, and the crisis posed by Yugoslavia disappeared. But if German forces now enter Yugoslavia, it will form a new crisis for Italy.

<h3>German Army Occupies Seven Army Corps in Czechoslovakia</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Lt. Col. Weidel, a German military officer who accompanied the occupation of Moravia and Bohemia, published an article in a newspaper today, stating that on March 15, the German troops that crossed the German-Czech border to occupy the provinces of Moravia and Bohemia consisted of seven army corps, drawn from the provinces of Silesia, Saxony, North Bavaria, and Austria, which entered Czechoslovakia in an encirclement from all directions.

<h3>Spain: Negotiations Broken Off; Nationalist Forces Issue Final Warning Demanding Immediate Surrender or City Will Be Attacked</h3>
<p>Madrid: As of now, there are no signs of an attack by the Nationalist forces. The city remains calm, save for the sound of anti-aircraft guns firing at twelve Nationalist bombers in the sky. The enemy aircraft did not drop any bombs. The police headquarters is crowded with people applying for passports. The road from Madrid to Valencia is filled with refugees. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Burgos: General Franco issued an ultimatum at 2:10 PM yesterday to the people in the areas controlled by the government forces, demanding an immediate cessation of resistance. He emphatically stated that since the Catalan campaign, the victory of the Nationalist forces has been universally recognized. Even the leaders of the government forces acknowledge the Nationalist's superiority. The outcome of the war is as clear as day. If the people in the government-controlled areas repent and cease resistance, the Nationalist government will be magnanimous, except for criminal offenders who will be tried by the courts. All military personnel and leftist party members will be given a chance to reform. (Haitong Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news received here, the surrender of the Madrid government forces may occur within 24 hours. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, a government aircraft flew to Burgos and returned at 5:45 PM. The Nationalist authorities declined to disclose the identity of the government representative and the purpose of his mission, but it is widely believed to be for discussing surrender terms. According to sources in Madrid, when the Secretary of the National Defense Council, Rio, gave a speech yesterday, he read out a telegram sent by the government forces to Burgos the day before, stating, "A plane will be sent tomorrow as a symbol of surrender. Please inform us in advance when your forces will enter." (Haitong Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Burgos: Regarding the ongoing peace talks between the two sides in the Spanish Civil War, after the representative of the Republican government brought back the conditions proposed by General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Nationalist forces, to Madrid, he arrived here again by plane at 3:00 PM this afternoon. He immediately continued negotiations with the plenipotentiaries appointed by General Franco, namely Police Chief Colonel Engel Ria and Intelligence Chief Colonel Gonzalo. They continued until 5:00 PM this afternoon, when he returned to Madrid on the same plane. According to general knowledge, General Franco demanded the immediate surrender of the Republican government and refused to continue negotiations. It is rumored that the Nationalist government has decided to launch a general offensive against Madrid, but due to heavy snow in recent days and blocked roads, it had to postpone the advance. Considering that the Nationalist forces launched an offensive on the central Cordoba front at dawn today, it is evident that the war may not be avoided. It is generally expected that although Madrid may fall without a fight, the other territories under the Republican government are not actually controlled by the National Defense Council. Unless force is used, it will be difficult to make them submit. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Madrid: After the breakdown of the peace talks between the two sides in the Spanish Civil War, Secretary of the National Defense Council, Rio, delivered a broadcast speech, explaining the course of events. He stated that the peace delegation sent by the National Defense Council to Burgos had presented eight conditions for peace to the Nationalist government authorities: (1) The Nationalist government should respect the territorial integrity of Spain; (2) The Nationalist government should respect the combatants of the Republican government and should not treat them harshly; (3) Republican government combatants arrested by the Nationalist forces should be brought before ordinary courts for trial and should not be subjected to retaliatory measures; (4) The lives, freedom, and interests of government military officers and soldiers should be protected; (5) The lives, freedom, and interests of militia members should be protected; (6) The lives, freedom, and interests of Republican government civil servants should be protected; (7) Republican government personnel who wish to leave the country should be given a 25-day preparation period; (8) Italian troops and indigenous troops from Morocco in North Africa should withdraw from Spain. After receiving these conditions, the Nationalist government put forward two points in response: (1) The Nationalist government will not only not interfere with Republican government personnel who voluntarily leave the country, but will also guarantee their safety before leaving the country; (2) As a show of sincerity, the Republican government should transfer all military aircraft to the Nationalist government between 3:00 PM and 6:00 PM on the 25th of this month. The National Defense Council believed that the conditions attached to this answer could not be immediately implemented in practice, and therefore requested an extension of time. Unexpectedly, the Nationalist government suddenly ordered its plenipotentiaries to cease negotiations at 6:00 PM this afternoon and demanded that the peace delegation sent by the National Defense Council return to the government forces' positions. "Since our compatriots have been killing each other for over two years, this tragedy has no possibility of ending now. The responsibility for this should be borne by the Nationalist government. Although the main policy of the National Defense Council was to conduct peace talks, it will continue to work towards this in the future." (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The peace talks between the two sides of the civil war have been declared broken. A broadcast message released here explained the breakdown, stating that after the National Defense Council presented eight conditions for peace to the Nationalist government, the Nationalist authorities had made a response, four of which were unacceptable to the National Defense Council: (1) Government military officers and soldiers who obeyed orders to defend the country were considered criminals; (2) Anyone who participated in the war to uphold their ideals was also considered a criminal; (3) Anyone who participated in political party activities and did not support the Nationalist uprising on July 17, 1936, in other words, members of all parties from the Republican Union Party to the Anarchist Federation, the Nationalist government would not guarantee their safety; (4) The Nationalist government would not guarantee the length of detention for criminals and stated, "They must be detained for a considerable period to encourage them to reflect." (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The National Defense Council here has dispatched peace delegates to Burgos to negotiate with representatives of the Nationalist government for many days. The Secretary of the National Defense Council, Teodoro, announced in a radio speech today that the Nationalist government authorities have suddenly terminated the negotiations, and the peace talks have therefore broken down. The Nationalist forces are preparing to launch a general offensive in the near future, and the National Defense Council has no choice but to take defensive measures. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>

<h3>Japan-Soviet Fishery Negotiations Reportedly Shift; A Compromise Can Be Reached</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to Japanese sources, the prospects for resolving the Soviet-Japanese fishery dispute have improved. It is reported that the Japanese side is now willing to accept a temporary agreement and abandon its fishing rights in 37 fishing grounds. It is also reported that the Japanese side is willing to participate in the auction of fishing grounds in Vladivostok, provided that the Soviet Union guarantees that Japanese fishermen can obtain more than 200 fishing grounds and avoid competition from Soviet fishermen. Japanese representatives have stated that a solution may be reached within a few days so that Japanese fishing boats can sail into Soviet territorial waters before the start of the fishing season on April 10th. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to a Japanese announcement tonight, after two hours of talks between the Soviet People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Maxim Litvinov, and the Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Shigenori Togo, the Far Eastern fishery issue has shown signs of compromise. Litvinov and Togo will meet again on Tuesday. Japanese sources here hope that this dispute can be resolved as soon as possible so that they can participate in the second unofficial auction of fishing grounds in Vladivostok on April 3rd. If this matter is not resolved, the Japanese hope that the second auction date can be postponed for several days, as they expect that if the second round of talks between Litvinov and Togo fails to resolve the fishery issue, it will at least be resolved in the third round. The main point of contention between the two countries is that 37 fishing grounds previously fished by the Japanese have been closed by the Soviet authorities for strategic reasons. The Soviet side intends to replace these 37 fishing grounds with other fishing grounds. (Associated Press, 26th)</p>
<h3>France Ready to Negotiate with Italy, but Needs Clarification on Three Demands</h3>
<p>(Paris) After Italian Premier Mussolini's speech, the most important thing for the French side is that Italy publicly announced its demands regarding Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal, but did not mention Nice, Savoy, and Corsica. Many believe that France will take this opportunity to diplomatically explore the possibility of reopening negotiations. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Italian Premier Mussolini's speech has been commented on by responsible sources here, who all say that the dispute between Italy and France has now officially become a diplomatic issue. The demands put forward by Italy are limited to Djibouti Port, the Tunisian protectorate, and the Suez Canal, but it is not yet certain whether they are territorial in nature. Until this point is clarified, it is impossible to determine whether France and Italy have the possibility of negotiating, and it cannot be determined for even a single day. In addition, all newspapers say that France has never refused to negotiate with Italy, but is unwilling to make any concessions on territory. Le Temps reported, "France has never refused to participate in any international negotiations, but if a certain country makes demands that infringe on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the French colonial empire, especially regarding the Tunisian protectorate, France will answer no." Le Parisien reported, "France has never refused to negotiate with anyone, but will never allow anyone to seize an inch of its land." (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Local newspapers originally thought that Italian Premier Mussolini's speech yesterday would be very emphatic and provocative in nature. Now that they see it is so calm, they are not too worried. Le Journal reported, "Although the audience expressed their approval with applause in several sections of the Italian premier's speech, what he said did not add fuel to the fire, but rather aimed to preserve peace." The newspaper also quoted its Berlin correspondent as saying that the Italian premier did not congratulate Germany on its annexation of Czechoslovakia and the recovery of the Memel region. The Germans pretended not to care much about this. "They also avoided mentioning Mussolini's statement that Italy has superior interests along the Adriatic coast." Le Petit Parisien reported, "France has no demands on Italy. If the Italian government believes that France and Italy have the possibility of negotiating, why not communicate its wishes to the French ambassador to Italy, Ponte?" The right-wing Le Figaro reported, "Since Italy has demands, if it wants to know the French government's opinion, it should seek it through normal diplomatic channels." Le Temps reported, "After Germany's power increased greatly, Italian Premier Mussolini must have felt that Germany would one day advance towards the Adriatic Sea. However, he was encouraged by Foreign Minister Ciano and Fascist Party Secretary-General Starace to the point where he could hardly extricate himself." L'Oeuvre, the newspaper of the Radical Socialist Party, reported, "We do not know what Italian Premier Mussolini wants from us, nor do we know whether we can accept it, discuss it, or consider it intolerable. It is said that Mussolini's spokesman, Gayda, has made some statements, but what can the French government do if it cannot negotiate with the likes of Gayda?" Le Populaire, the newspaper of the Socialist Party, reported, "Mussolini is truly a disciple of Hitler, and his imitation of Hitler can be said to be meticulous, even down to the way he speaks to the masses. It is futile for us to try to find out any detailed information or his intentions in his speech. However, Mussolini's spokesman, Gayda, published an article in Il Popolo d'Italia on the day of Mussolini's speech, saying that there are still 3.5 million Germans in France, and the implication is clear." (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today's newspapers carried articles authorized by official circles, stating, "Italy has now explained its historical rights to Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal through the words of its political leader, and the issue of resolving the dispute is now public and cannot be ignored." (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding Italian Premier Mussolini's speech in Rome yesterday, Berlin political circles believe that it is an important contribution to clarifying the policies of the Rome-Berlin Axis and therefore express their complete approval. Regarding the three points raised by Mussolini: Tunisia, Djibouti, and the Suez Canal, Berlin believes that Mussolini has expressed his willingness to negotiate. How things will proceed in the future depends on France's response. Today's newspapers also published articles commenting on Mussolini's speech. "The Berliner Lokalanzeiger stated that the obstacles between France and Italy mentioned by Mussolini in his previous speech in Genoa have now been eliminated due to the change in the situation in Spain. However, this rift has not yet been completely healed." (Haitong Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) After Italian Premier Mussolini's speech yesterday, British newspapers have commented on it, unanimously believing that he intends to negotiate with France. As to whether it is beneficial for France to negotiate with him, opinions differ. The Times carried a dispatch from its Rome correspondent stating, "Although the Italian premier's speech mentioned the Rome-Berlin Axis, it has created an opportunity for France and Italy to resolve their disputes. If France can give Italy reasonable concessions, Mussolini is prepared and willing to be friends with France, but he will not forget his ties with Germany." The newspaper's diplomatic correspondent said, "The British government is currently studying the Italian premier's speech carefully. The initial impression of the general public is that the European situation has not become more tense as a result." (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>
<h3>Whether Britain Will Implement Conscription Still Divides Opinions; Chamberlain Repeatedly Meets with Opposition to Request Cooperation in Strengthening National Defense Plan</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain met with the leader of the opposition Labour Party, Greenwood, at 10 Downing Street this morning for talks. People in political circles are paying close attention, saying that the government and the opposition Labour Party have been exchanging views repeatedly for a week. The purpose is to persuade the parties to cooperate with the government to strengthen the national defense plan so that it can be promoted more quickly. The matter will still be presided over by Prime Minister Chamberlain and participated in by the opposition, so it is not a cabinet reshuffle. In addition, Prime Minister Chamberlain stated in the House of Commons several months ago that he would never implement conscription in peacetime. Now he may ask the House of Commons to allow him to retract his previous statement when necessary. If so, a military conscription system may be implemented domestically first. (Havas Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the issue of implementing conscription, semi-official circles here have released a communique authorized by the government, stating that the government has no intention of adopting conscription and does not intend to implement national mandatory registration. It stated that after Italian Premier Mussolini's speech this morning, the international situation has not only not deteriorated but has become more relaxed. If major changes occur in the international situation in the future and unexpected events cause it to erupt immediately, the government may reconsider the issue of implementing conscription. At that time, it may even invite the opposition parties to participate in a national cabinet. However, as far as the current situation is concerned, the realization of this proposal is still far away. Members of various parties in the government mostly oppose the proposal to implement conscription. When most members of the Conservative Party held a meeting one day, they considered promoting a "mandatory training plan" and believed that this plan was different from conscription. However, when discussing the content of the plan, opinions failed to converge. In short, because continental countries border other countries on land, they have to maintain large armies. The situation is different in our country. What we should pay attention to is that in the event of unexpected events in the future, we may take joint action with other countries. In this case, it is questionable whether we can fulfill our obligations without implementing conscription from beginning to end. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources here recently stated that the issue of implementing conscription is still of the greatest concern to the cabinet. The views of the cabinet members are not the same. Foreign Secretary Halifax fully supports it and has obtained Prime Minister Chamberlain's consent to some extent. However, Home Secretary Hall Nay and Chancellor Simon strongly oppose it. They all say that if the government extends the term of military service or implements conscription, it will never win the general election. It is said that the Imperial Defense Committee supports the establishment of a mandatory service system that is different from conscription. However, the opposition Labour Party opposes all kinds of mandatory service systems, regardless of their form. At the very least, they are unwilling to implement it under the leadership of Prime Minister Chamberlain. In short, how to decide on this issue depends on the rise and fall of the war crisis. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a Reuters parliamentary correspondent, there is no basis for the rumors circulating in some newspapers and elsewhere that Prime Minister Chamberlain will resign. It is said that the rumors of a cabinet split are mainly due to the issue of implementing conscription. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Stirling, Scotland: Opposition Labour MP Johnston, who once served as Lord Privy Seal, gave a speech here, expressing his opposition to conscription. He stated that the people should know why they are being conscripted. Members of our party will never fight for the cause of the empire. If France and Italy clash over Djibouti Port, our party will not want to be drawn into the vortex. To induce Mussolini to separate from Germany, the Suez Canal and Gibraltar should be internationalized. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Dublin: Irish Republican President Eamon de Valera returned from Switzerland yesterday. He passed through London and met with Prime Minister Chamberlain in the suburbs of Coates Town to discuss the European situation. This matter is highly valued by Republican political circles, who are asking what the Republican attitude will be in the event of a European war. Regarding this, two different opinions have already emerged within the opposition Irish Unity Party when the House of Representatives recently discussed national defense issues. One part advocates strict neutrality, while the other believes that neutrality is impossible. The debate is fierce and difficult to resolve. Well-informed sources say that the Republican attitude in the future European war is important to the United Kingdom. It can take the opportunity to re-propose the issue of the unification of Northern and Southern Ireland. The Northern Irish Minister of Finance, Andrews, recently visited London and is said to have informed the British government of the concessions that Northern Ireland can agree to in order to facilitate the establishment of a settlement plan. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Grimsby: Former Foreign Secretary Eden gave a speech here this afternoon, advocating that all parties should immediately form a united national cabinet and unite all peace-loving countries in Europe to curb German leader Hitler's blind advance. He said, "At this point, all we can do is unite and work hard. We cannot waste another hour. We must work actively so that the whole world knows that Britain has woken up and is very sincere. There must be an immediate ceasefire between the parties and a new cabinet must be formed on the broadest basis. As for foreign affairs, Foreign Secretary Halifax issued a statement on the 22nd of this month expressing his willingness to unite all peace-loving countries in Europe to resist future German aggression. I believe that the government should step up the promotion of this policy, and it will be more likely to succeed if it can speak on behalf of all parties in the country. I firmly believe it. As for domestic affairs, the government must immediately take necessary measures on industrial resources and human resources to complete the maximum effort in military affairs in the shortest possible time. In short, if the government can promote this policy both domestically and abroad, it will undoubtedly promote national unity." (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3>The New Fourth Army's Year of Anti-Japanese War: Experiences and Lessons</h3>
<p>— Xiang Ying</p>
<p>Our Army's Course in the Anti-Japanese War</p>
<p>The New Fourth Army was established in a very short time, truly emerging from the midst of the Anti-Japanese War, which distinguishes it from other armies. It can be said that the establishment of our army has gone through four stages until today.</p>
<p>First Stage: Reorganization. The predecessors of our army were the Red Guerrilla forces and Red Army units scattered across the southern provinces of Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Hubei. Since the July 7th, August 13th Incidents, the Red Army and Red Guerrilla forces in the southern provinces, in order to defend the Republic of China and strive for the liberation of the Chinese nation, were reorganized into the New Fourth Army of the National Revolutionary Army on October 2nd of the 26th year of the Republic [1937], according to the order of the Military Commission. In reality, the reorganization of our troops into the New Fourth Army began in January of the 27th year [1938], and it can be said that the formal completion of the reorganization took place in the 27th year. Although our troops were scattered across seven or eight provinces in the south, covering a vast area and consisting of many units, they were able to unanimously complete the reorganization of the troops under this order and the decision of the Chinese Communist Party. From January to mid-February of the 27th year was the period of reorganization for our army.</p>
<p>Second Stage: Concentration. One month after the reorganization, the New Fourth Army was ordered by Chairman Chiang [Kai-shek] to concentrate in two locations, north of the river to concentrate towards XX, and south of the river to concentrate towards XX. After February 10th, the second stage began, with the reorganized troops concentrating according to the designated areas. First, the First Detachment moved out from various garrisons on February 10th, followed by the Second Detachment and the Third Detachment continuing to advance. North of the river also gradually concentrated towards the XX area. Our military headquarters moved from Nanchang to southern Anhui on April 10th. Although the vast majority of our troops were more than two thousand li apart, and most of them marched on foot, they finally completed the concentration on April 10th. After the concentration was completed, the commander-in-chief of the war zone sent personnel to XX to inspect the concentrated troops. From February 10th to April 10th was the second stage.</p>
<p>Third Stage: The Advance and Deployment of Troops. When our troops had finished concentrating, we received an order from the commander-in-chief, instructing us to quickly advance and move to the combat areas to engage in battle. This was the order of April 15th. I remember that the mission assigned to us in the order was to form a guerrilla network in the designated areas, attack the enemy, disrupt their transportation, and build guerrilla base areas in the designated areas.</p>
<p>After our troops completed the inspection, they began to advance towards the designated areas and combat areas on April 28th. This was the day the vanguard of our army advanced. This vanguard was organized from a portion of our troops in the south of the river. Its mission was to understand and scout the advance routes and combat situations in order to facilitate the advance of the troops. After the vanguard set off, the main force troops followed in succession, advancing into the combat areas south of the river along with the vanguard. At the same time, our headquarters also moved to the southern section in May to command the entire army in combat. From April 20th to May, on the one hand, our troops advanced, and on the other hand, they engaged in combat after entering the combat areas. This was the third stage of our army's Anti-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Fourth Stage: Combat. After our troops advanced to the combat areas and formally deployed, they officially engaged in combat. (A) First, when the troops north of the river arrived at the designated combat area (May 16th), the enemy was attacking Hefei, attempting to cross the west bank on the east bank of Chaohu Lake. The first battle of our army began at Jiangjiahekoun. The result of the battle was the complete defeat of the enemy landing at Chaohu Lake. They captured eleven guns and one Japanese flag. This was the victory of our army's first battle north of the river. (B) Second, on June 18th south of the river, the first battle south of the river began at Weigang, south of Zhenjiang. It can also be said that it was the first decisive victory south of the river. This time, it was an interception of cars traveling south from Zhenjiang. Except for one that escaped, all were destroyed, and one Japanese Major Doi and one Captain Umeoka Takero were killed, and ten long and short guns, as well as other military supplies, and more than 7,000 Japanese yen were captured. This was the victory of the first battle south of the river. Since May 16th north of the river and June 18th south of the river, battles began, and the most intense battles were conducted south and north of the river. This type of combat was based on the mission given to us by the commander-in-chief, and the mission was completed through combat. This combat mission was still a guerrilla warfare mission. Until the end of September, we then received an order from the commander-in-chief, instructing our troops to take over the friendly forces' positions on the Qingyi River. On October 7th, one detachment went to the area along the Qingyi River to take over the positions. This was the beginning of our army assuming local positional warfare. In this stage, most of it was guerrilla warfare and a small part was positional warfare. In terms of the army's firepower, our army's firepower was very weak. Without strong firepower, it was impossible to assume positional warfare and conduct positional warfare. However, for the needs of the Anti-Japanese War, and to facilitate the operations of friendly forces on the same front, we had to reluctantly accept this mission and complete this mission. Some people say that the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army do not fight positional warfare, and that they refuse positional warfare. People who say these things do not understand or misunderstand. We can say that our firepower is worse than any army. An army with weak firepower cannot assume positional warfare and cannot complete positional warfare missions. But for the sake of the Anti-Japanese War, as long as it is beneficial to the Anti-Japanese War, even if it means greater sacrifices, we must accept this mission and strive to complete it.</p>
<p>This explains the four stages of our army's Anti-Japanese War: the first stage, reorganization; the second stage, concentration; the third stage, advance and deployment; and the fourth stage, combat. These four stages are the experiences of our army in the 27th year of the Republic [1938]. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Renewed Fighting Between Hungarian and Slovak Forces</h3>
<p>Bratislava – According to news received here, although Hungary and Slovakia have declared a ceasefire, fighting has now resumed on the border. The artillery fire is quite intense, and there have been many casualties. Although the authorities hope to stop the war, they have been unsuccessful. Slovak political circles claim that the Hungarian side wants to occupy more territory in order to pressure Slovakia during negotiations to demarcate the boundary line. According to reports, border demarcation negotiations are scheduled to begin today in the Hungarian capital. (Reuter, 27th)</p>

<h3>The Fourteenth Dalai Lama Will Be Chosen by Drawing Lots from the Golden Urn</h3>
<p>Scheduled to be Held This Winter</p>
<p>Presided Over by Wu Zhongxin and Reting</p>
<p>Chongqing Telegram – News from the frontier states that the reincarnation of the Thirteenth Dalai Lama, who passed away on December 17th of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], has already been found, and the Fourteenth Dalai Lama is about to emerge. This reporter made a special visit to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, the Tibetan Affairs Office, and Tibetans in Chongqing, spending an entire day in order to obtain a great deal of interesting news.</p>
<p>It is said that the location where the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama was discovered this time was in Qinghai. How was it discovered? It was based on the spiritual instructions obtained during sea gazing. This sea-gazing ceremony is held at Tengri Lake near Lhasa, presided over by Reting Hutuktu, the regent of Tibet. During the ceremony, a phenomenon similar to a mirage will occur on the surface of the sea.</p>
<p>Spiritual Manifestations. This phenomenon is used to make predictions. However, this phenomenon is not obtained by gazing at the sea only once. Since the Dalai Lama's passing, Reting Hutuktu has held the ceremony hundreds of times. Finally, results were obtained in the winter of the 25th year [1936]. What was revealed this time faintly contained the characters for Qinghai, so it was determined that the future Dalai Lama would be in Qinghai. After more than a year of searching, the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama was found in Xining, Qinghai, last autumn. Moreover, his birth date coincided with the Dalai Lama's death date, which fully complies with Tibetan religious regulations. In Tibet, the birth date coinciding with the Dalai Lama's death date is also a necessary condition for being designated as the Dalai Lama's reincarnation.</p>
<p>However, according to other sources, two children believed to be the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama were also found in the area northeast of Lhasa inhabited by Han Chinese in the spring of the year before last. According to Tibetan religious regulations, in addition to sea gazing, the Dalai Lama's last words can also serve as a basis for searching for the Dalai Lama's reincarnation. For example, if the Dalai Lama stated in his last words where he would be reincarnated, and a child whose birth date coincided with the Dalai Lama's death date is later found in that place, then that child can be considered the Dalai Lama's reincarnation. It is said that the children found in Lhasa were found based on this.</p>
<p>As of now, a total of three reincarnations of the Dalai Lama have been found. It is unlikely that there will be any new discoveries. As for how to determine which one of these is the true reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, a</p>
<p>Solemn Lottery</p>
<p>Ceremony will be held to determine him. This ceremony is conducted according to the Golden Urn Lottery Law established by the Tibetans in the 57th year of the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing Dynasty (1752). It is said that in the past, the transmission of the robes and bowl of the lamas was always done by the "Chui Zhong" (i.e., after the lama's death, temporarily acting as the regent of Tibet, performing rituals to descend the gods and impartially designating the successor). The Golden Urn Lottery Law was established in the 57th year of the Qianlong Emperor. A jade urn is placed in the Jokhang Temple in Lhasa, and the names of the children found to be reincarnations of the Dalai Lama are written on separate slips, which are then placed in the urn. The "Chui Zhong" then publicly draws a slip. Whoever's name is drawn will inherit the Fourteenth Dalai Lama. Those whose names are not drawn will also be given important positions, as it is believed that these children, although not the Dalai Lama's reincarnation, are also of divine origin. The host of this Golden Urn Lottery ceremony is Wu Zhongxin, the current chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, who has been ordered by the National Government to preside over the ceremony together with Reting Hutuktu, the current regent of Tibet. The date has not yet been determined, and it will have to wait until the child found in Qinghai is sent to Lhasa before it can be held. However, due to the difficulties of transportation between Qinghai and Tibet, it is estimated that the journey will take place in the winter of this year at the earliest.</p>
<h3>A Trip to Shao and Shan</h3>
<p>A Prosperous Atmosphere in Counties Along the Highway</p>
<p>Rapid Advances in Industrial and Commercial Enterprises in Xingning</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence – The Shao-Chao Highway not only connects the river basins of northeastern and eastern Guangdong Province but, because of its connection with the Shao-Lian Highway, can also be used to reach the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. Its starting and ending points are, on the one hand, the center of Guangdong Province's rear defense during the Anti-Japanese War, the location of the war zone command and the provincial government, and on the other hand, the coastal area, the only commercial port in southern China after the fall of Guangzhou and the loss of Haikou, Shantou. In the current stage of the Anti-Japanese War in southern China, it is no accident that this highway, which serves as the artery connecting northeastern Guangdong Province, has attracted attention. This reporter returned from the interior and spent three days traveling the entire length of the highway. Due to the short time and the fact that I was traveling by car, what I saw was of course a cursory glance, but the journey along the way left some indelible impressions. After unloading my luggage, I rushed to write this for the reference of those who are concerned about transportation in the interior.</p>
<h3>Spring Arrives in Qujiang, Full of Vigor</h3>
<p>When traveling east, it was just after the Lunar New Year. Firmly resolute people and a lively market, everywhere expressing a vigorous scene. Qujiang has taken on the mission of being the center of the Anti-Japanese War. In particular, the general civil servants, although living in extreme material deprivation, are all working hard and striving forward. This situation is indeed much improved compared to before the fall of Guangzhou. Transportation has also not encountered irreparable difficulties because the railway has been destroyed. Now, long-distance buses from various places are mostly running smoothly. Although there is a shortage of vehicles, the porters walking on the highway can also supplement the lack of machinery. Currently, most of the import and export goods from Hunan, Jiangxi, and northwestern Guangdong are gathered and distributed in Qujiang. In addition to being a military and political center, it is unexpected that Qujiang has also become the economic center of southern China.</p>
<h3>The Volume of Passenger and Freight Traffic on the Shao-Chao Highway Has Increased Sharply</h3>
<p>This is because, in the current stage of the Anti-Japanese War in southern China, the import and export goods from Hunan, Jiangxi, and northwestern Guangdong mostly rely on this Shao-Chao Highway for transportation. Therefore, as soon as the vehicle transport opened, passengers and goods from various places poured in like a tide. Currently, the majority of people staying in the inns in Qujiang are merchants waiting for buses to travel east, and most of the goods piled up in the stores' warehouses are local products waiting to be transported east by bus. Merchants traveling east from the interior find it difficult to buy a bus ticket even after waiting in Qujiang for three or four days. Sometimes, due to the small number of tickets and the large number of passengers, they even use the method of drawing lots to decide who gets to buy a ticket. Although the fare is only 25 national currency dollars, some people are willing to pay two or three times more to ride on the freight trucks owned by various commercial firms. Currently, there are three or four companies on the Chao-Shao Road that transport goods in and out. They all have their own new-style light trucks, some with more than ten vehicles, others with two or three. They mostly transport daily necessities such as cloth and cigarettes to the interior, and transport local products from the interior. It is said that they have made a lot of profit recently. This is indeed a very speculative business in a time of national crisis.</p>
<h3>Very Good Impressions of Wengyuan and Lianping</h3>
<p>After waiting for a few days for a passenger bus in Qujiang, the reporter knew that it would be impossible to buy a ticket in the short term. After much trouble, I finally boarded a freight truck traveling east. The freight truck departed at 7 a.m. on the 23rd of last month. There were a total of five freight trucks traveling together. The trucks were full of local products such as fruits from northwestern Fujian. After traveling for half a day, there was really nothing to see on the road except for the continuous mountains. At noon, we arrived at a market town under the jurisdiction of Wengyuan County, named Longxian Market. This market town is relatively prosperous in commerce because it is located at the confluence of the Furong River and the Zhen River, and because there is a highway that can directly reach Heyuan. After eating lunch in Pingli, we continued our journey. The car gradually drove into the territory of Lianping County, and the mountains on both sides gradually became steeper. After passing several dangerous slopes and several winding mountain foothills, we saw that the sky was approaching dusk. The village women gathering firewood and the yellow cows grazing still loomed among the weeds and wild smoke along the way. Thinking of the hardships of life in the mountainous areas and the hard work of the local people, one could not help but sigh. At 5 p.m., we arrived at Zhongxin Market under the jurisdiction of Lianping County. That night, because of the inconvenience of traveling, everyone split up and found inns in the market to stay overnight. Zhongxin Market also has highways that can reach Heyuan and Huiyang. The mushrooms and Jingpersimmons produced nearby are all transported out through this market. Since the Shao-Lake Highway opened to traffic, the commerce here has become even more prosperous. Because it is close to the Jiulian Mountains with steep ridges and layers of rocks, the terrain is also extremely dangerous. This is indeed an important place for the rear defense of the eastern front of Guangdong's Anti-Japanese War. It is said that the Jiulian Mountains here have thousands of paths and connect nine counties, which is enough to establish a strong fortress for Guangdong's rear defense.</p>
<h3>Xingning's Industry is Highly Developed</h3>
<p>After spending the night in Zhongxin Market, we set off towards Laolong early the next morning. Because we were traveling through mountainous areas and remote suburbs, there was nothing along the way that was worth remembering. At 11 a.m., we passed Laolong, and the highway gradually progressed towards the lowlands. At 5 p.m., the car had arrived in Xingning. As soon as we arrived in the highly prosperous city of Xingning, we suddenly saw the modern urban facilities here and entered another world. Xingning's cloth industry was originally very developed. After the coastal cities were successively destroyed after the July 7th Incident, it relied on this industrial base to suddenly and rapidly develop. After the Shao-Chao Highway opened to traffic, its prosperity reached a fever pitch. Tens of thousands of merchants thronged the streets all day long. The chimneys of the factories spewed thick smoke day and night. In addition to the cloth industry, other industrial and commercial enterprises gradually established themselves. Factories for repairing automobiles, factories for manufacturing metal products, and even factories for manufacturing cigarettes could all be found here. The products were transported east along the Huiyang Highway and north along the Shao-Chao Highway. Undoubtedly, Xingning's industrial and commercial enterprises have replaced Guangzhou's past obligation to comfort the interior. The reporter continued on from Jieyang and arrived in Chaoan in the afternoon. After staying overnight, I took the train on the Chao-Shan Railway to Shantou, thus ending the journey on the Shao-Chao Highway.</p>
<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Social Education Facilities in Zhejiang Province Since the Anti-Japanese War</h3>
<p>Running People's Schools and Promoting Electrification Education</p>
<p>Organizing Wartime Service Mobile Teaching Groups</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Education Authorities regard social education as an urgent task for the Anti-Japanese War and national reconstruction. Mobilizing the people's grassroots work is an urgent matter. Therefore, since the war, they have spared no effort to promote the establishment of social education facilities. The following is a summary of the attitudes and facilities of Zhejiang Province in social education during the year after the war.</p>
<h3>Running Wartime People's Schools</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education has been promoting supplementary education for out-of-school people in peacetime, and the need for it is even more urgent after the war. In addition to the 19 counties and cities, including Hangzhou and Hangxian, that have fallen into the war zone, which have been handled with separate measures, the "Provisional Measures for Running Wartime People's Schools in Various Counties and Cities of Zhejiang Province" have been specially formulated and promulgated, ordering various counties to uniformly run them. Wartime people's schools have now been planned one after another, and those that have been completed separately include 2,100 schools, 2,930 classes, and 118,668 students.</p>
<h3>Establishing the Bihu Implementation Area</h3>
<p>Since western Zhejiang became a war zone, the social education agencies of the province suffered a disastrous fate, which greatly affected their work. Eastern Zhejiang is located in the rear, and the population has increased sharply. In order to meet the needs of the actual situation, the Bihu Social Education Implementation Area was established in Bihu Town, Lishui, in September of last year. The area has two groups, general affairs and teaching, which are engaged in promoting library reading, sports activities, and people's schools. After several months of operation, it has taken on a rough shape. This year, it was decided to increase personnel to conduct more concrete experiments.</p>
<h3>Promoting Electrification Education</h3>
<p>Electrification education is a powerful tool for promoting culture and awakening the people. During the war, in order to expand its promotion, the "Zhejiang Province Implementation Plan for Broadcasting Education Network and Film Education Network" was specially formulated and implemented step by step. All electrification education personnel in the province were also summoned to hold a discussion meeting on electrification education work. Definite decisions were made on the production of anti-Japanese war films, the preparation of electrification education funds, and the improvement of film touring teams, in order to make long-term progress in electrification education work in the future.</p>
<h3>Supervising and Concurrently Running Social Education</h3>
<p>The Zhejiang Province primary and secondary schools have been concurrently running social education for many years, and the results have been remarkable. In May of last year, the Ministry of Education ordered various schools at all levels to concurrently run social education, in order to eliminate the boundaries between schools and society, and to socialize schools and schoolize society. The Zhejiang Department of Education specially drafted a plan and issued a notice to all schools at all levels to strictly implement it. In addition, wartime service groups and mobile teaching groups were organized, which have seen rapid development compared to the promotion of social education before the war.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihui Speaks on the Educational Problems in the Mind of an Outsider (1)</h3>
<p>Strict Management in Education is Necessary to Avoid Failure</p>
<p>With National Crisis at Hand, Practice Economy by Setting an Example</p>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) Mr. Wu Zhihui, a veteran of the Party and the State, recently gave an academic lecture in Yu, responding to the joint office of Chinese Educational Academic Groups. The topic was "Educational Problems in the Mind of an Outsider." In terms of educational management, he quoted classics and elaborated extensively, emphasizing that education cannot be effective without strict management. Furthermore, with the country facing a crisis, he stressed the importance of practicing economy by setting an example and earnestly implementing it. His earnest words were enough to admonish current customs. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Gentlemen,</p>
<p>Today, I am grateful to the joint office of Chinese Educational Academic Groups for allowing me to give a speech on educational issues. Because I am a complete outsider when it comes to education, today's topic is "Educational Problems in the Mind of an Outsider." It may be too absurd to have an outsider speak to you about the educational problems you are studying. However, today is a holiday, so please feel free to laugh. Moreover, for an outsider, even nonsense can serve as a reference.</p>
<p>In recent years, our leader, the President, has often mentioned the four words "guan, jiao, yang, wei" (管教養衛 – manage, teach, nurture, protect) in his instructions. Recently, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education also provided a very concise explanation of the meaning of these four words. In my layman's terms, "guan" (manage) means to make people do something and not allow them not to do it. "Jiao" (teach) is to tell them what they should do, so they must not fail to do it. "Yang" (nurture) means to cultivate their abilities. "Wei" (protect) means that once they have the ability to protect themselves, they can also protect the country and the people. As the saying goes, "guan jiao, guan jiao" (manage and teach), teaching cannot be without management. Nurturing and protecting both belong to the part of education. Therefore, the four words "guan, jiao, yang, wei" can be summarized as the two words "jiao yu" (教育 – education). Now, using my outsider's perspective, let me talk nonsense about "guan, jiao, yang, wei." What is "guan" (manage)? Nowadays, people often misunderstand the meaning of "guan," as if it is only to manage others, forgetting that those who manage others must first manage themselves. Therefore, when people hear the word "guan," they are not very happy. For example, when I walk on the street, I sometimes have to listen to the police's command and management. If I misunderstand the meaning of "guan" and think that I am a person of status and should not be managed by a mere policeman, then this is not right. The first condition of "guan" is to be able to manage oneself. Because managing oneself is the noblest thing. A person who waits for others to manage them is already inferior. If they still refuse to be managed, they simply lose their status. Therefore, it is best to be able to do it without anyone managing you, but to be able to reflect on yourself and know that you will never do anything that benefits yourself but harms others. If everyone does this, society will naturally achieve governance without management. When it comes to the question of whether or not to manage, one cannot help but talk about the goodness or evil of human nature. Many scholars throughout history have discussed the issue of the goodness or evil of human nature. Some say that human nature is good, some say that human nature is evil, and some say that human nature is both good and evil. In my personal opinion, let's not ask about human nature. I can presume that people are half good and half bad. The world's population will never be all good, nor will it be all bad. Think of an orange tree. The oranges on the tree will never all be big. Some will be good and big, and some will be small and bad. In short, "people's rights can be equal, but people's wisdom cannot be equal." Our Confucius also said, "Those above average can be told about higher things; those below average cannot be told about higher things." Who is considered an average person? The Book of Han has a distinction of nine levels of personality. I think four, five, and six are average people, one, two, and three are above average, and seven, eight, and nine are below average. Based on this classification method to distinguish people's goodness and evil, we can say that among a hundred people, there is one best good person in terms of goodness. In addition, there are four good people in terms of good and evil who are not easily corrupted. There are also fifteen good people who occasionally become bad. In terms of evil, there are also five bad people who are not easily turned good, and there are fifteen bad people who occasionally become good. Removing the ten at each end, the remaining sixty are what we call average people, because they can be good people or bad people. If we carefully examine the actions of people from all walks of life, we can prove that this statement is not very wrong. This theory can also be seen in political endeavors. Europe and the United States have party politics. They often divide into two major parties, conservative and liberal. Why do the members of the two parties have varying numbers? Because of the varying numbers, sometimes the Conservative Party is in power, and sometimes the Liberal Party is in power. According to party loyalty, once a person joins a party, they should not betray it. Then, however many are divided at once should remain unchanged forever. Why do they vary? This is because those above average will never betray the party, while those below average are mostly wavering elements who easily change, often suddenly conservative, suddenly liberal, shifting their support according to their likes and dislikes. Therefore, the ruling party follows them to power and follows them down. I dare say that no matter how culturally advanced or educationally developed a country is, at most only sixty-five out of a hundred people are good, and at least thirty-five are bad. Conversely, no matter how culturally and educationally backward a country is, there are always thirty-five good people out of a hundred, and at most only sixty-five bad people. In the first year of the Republic of China, Mr. Ding Fubao thought that I had worked in the education field and joked with me, saying, "I am willing to give one million yuan a day and ask you to teach all the people in the world to be good." I shook my head and said I couldn't do it. He then said, "Since it is not easy to teach them to be good, then I will give one million yuan a day and ask you to teach all the people in the world to be bad." I still shook my head. At that time, everyone who heard the joke also shook their heads. Now everyone must think that prostitution, gambling, and eating are things that everyone likes, and persuading people with prostitution, gambling, and eating will surely be pleasing to them. How would you know? You try standing on the streets of Shilihong to teach people prostitution, gambling, and eating. I guarantee that many people will slap you. This proves that my assertion that there are ultimately thirty-five good people is not very wrong. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Specialist Schools Above the Xiang and E Provinces Are Being Relocated Again</h3>
<p>Seven Schools including Tangshan Engineering College</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently ordered the schools originally relocated in Hunan and Hubei to find new locations for relocation. These include: (1) National Jiaotong University Tangshan Engineering College relocated from Hunan to Kunming, (2) National Jiangsu Medical College relocated from Hunan to Guiyang, (3) Private Wuchang Zhonghua University relocated from Yichang to Chongqing, (4) National Zhongshan University relocated from Luobao to Longmen, Guangxi, (5) Private Lingnan University relocated to Hong Kong, (6) Jiangsu Provincial Bank Specialist School relocated from Taoyuan to Qiancheng, (7) National Art Specialist School relocated to Yunnan. The remaining Guangdong Provincial Education Institute and Private Wuxi Guoxue Training School have also been relocated from Wuzhou and Guilin in Guangxi to the countryside for classes.</p>
<h3>Fudan University Renamed National Xikang University</h3>
<p>To be Relocated to Xikang from Chongqing</p>
<p>Shanghai Private Fudan University was completely destroyed by fire. Therefore, in addition to a part of the school remaining in Shanghai to start classes, it has also relocated to Chongqing to start classes. All school affairs are still the responsibility of President Qian Yongming and Vice President Wu Nanxuan. Considering the school's long history and satisfactory management, the Ministry of Education has ordered the school to relocate to Xikang and be renamed National Xikang University to cultivate talents for the border region. After receiving the order, the school is currently preparing for the relocation.</p>
<h3>Children's Welfare Association Extends Education for Newsboys</h3>
<p>Fourteen Newsboy Schools Have Been Opened</p>
<p>Sports Meet to be Held After Children's Day</p>
<p>The Children's Welfare Association of this city has already established ten newsboy schools and has now increased the number to twenty-one. Fourteen schools have opened. The funds are raised by Chairman Chen Heqin and total more than 800 yuan. The Shen Bao donates 300 yuan per month. The original trial period was for six months and was scheduled to end at the end of April. It is now known that it has been decided to continue the funding. It is also heard that Cao Jingyuan, the principal of Peicheng Girls' Middle School in this city, donates 20 yuan per month and provides a classroom free of charge to run the newsboy school. Furthermore, the Association plans to hold a newsboy sports meet after Children's Day to promote newsboy sports.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Pays Attention to Elementary School Physical Education</h3>
<p>Daily Morning Exercises to be Implemented</p>
<p>Implementation Guidelines Determined</p>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) The Ministry of Education believes that physical education is a basic necessity for self-defense. However, training cannot be effective if applied to adults or the elderly. It must first be applied to elementary school children to be effective. The importance of elementary school physical education is based on whether a person is healthy or not, which is developed in childhood. Especially during this period of intense resistance against Japan, it is even more important to vigorously promote it. The Ministry of Education has now ordered all public or registered private elementary schools in all provinces and cities to actively implement it in accordance with the Ministry's regulations. Morning exercises must be implemented every day before class. The implementation guidelines for elementary school physical education are recorded below:</p>
<p>A. Based on the school environment: (1) Venue, (2) Equipment, (3) Economy. B. Based on the student's level: (1) Exercise ability, (2) Knowledge ability. C. Based on local conditions: (1) Nature, (2) Habits. D. Based on the value of teaching materials: (1) Exercise can be done anytime and anywhere, (2) Inspire good behavior in children, (3) Others.</p>
<h3>Huaijiu Girls' Middle School Screens Students</h3>
<p>Huaijiu Girls' Middle School has recently been holding student screening registration.

In addition, there are several students in the senior high school grades 1 and 2 and the junior high school 2nd Grade B class. All students who are to be screened have been notified by the school to their parents by special letter, requiring them to fill out a guarantee letter and send it back to the school by registered mail before the 30th of this month, or ask the parents to bring the students to Weihaiwei Road for contact. Those who fail to comply by the deadline will be considered as voluntarily withdrawing from school.</p>

As a result, the situation remained unchanged. The US exchange rate should have softened slightly due to the continuous decline in the British-American exchange rate for two days. However, as Hong Kong Electric continued to sell, the final result was evenly matched, with flat trading. The Hong Kong exchange rate was relatively stable due to the equilibrium between supply and demand.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's long-term and short-term interest rates were flat. New York silver prices remained unchanged, and London gold prices did not fluctuate. The exchange rate of the British pound against the US dollar decreased by three cents, while remaining flat against the French franc and the Shanghai dollar.

<h3>Securities: Government Bonds Turn Steady in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>In the unofficial securities market yesterday, there was a tendency for continued gains. However, some speculators deliberately spread fabricated rumors in the market. Those who relied on hearsay for information sold off their holdings, while the rumor-mongers took advantage of the low prices to absorb. Market prices fluctuated accordingly. Finance Minister Kung's speech was related to foreign debt. Therefore, the market had already secretly turned towards gains after the market closed. Speculating on the future, there should be a rebound today. In the early morning, Hongda, Chengkang, Xie Da, and Dafeng, among others, were actively absorbing Class C shares. No. 38 absorbed Class E shares. However, the market price began to decline as Lianhe, Runli, Tiansheng, and Zhenkang, among other bulls, sold off their holdings. Excess longs emerged, and the price fell by 3 to 5 cents before noon. The market was quiet in the afternoon, and prices were stable. No. 5 bought Class A shares, and No. 20 and Dafeng bought Class E shares. Tongkang and No. 7 sold off slightly. Market prices varied, with highs and lows alternating. In the end, the total value of transactions was over 500,000 yuan, with a small decrease ranging from 2.5 cents to 5.5 cents. There were no transactions for the 96 shares. A summary table is listed below: Category - Highest, Lowest, Closing Price, Compared to the Previous Day; Unified A - 57.40, 57.25, 57.40, Down 0.25; Unified B - 51.55, 51.20, 51.25, Down 0.45; Unified C - 51.30, 50.75, 50.80, Down 0.55; Unified D - 50.05, 49.60, 49.70, Down 0.50; Unified E - 50.25, 49.75, 49.90, Down 0.45</p>

<h3>Foreign Currencies Fluctuate with an Upward Trend</h3>
<p>Last Saturday, the price of pure British gold remained unchanged, and the British-American exchange rate decreased by 0.0625. Yesterday, foreign exchange transactions in Shanghai were very active among electricity companies and foreign firms. The supply from Hong Kong Electric and banks was smooth, and market prices were stable, with no clear winners or losers. The opening price was quite firm, and bullion shops and retail investors actively bought, causing market prices to rise gradually. However, gold shops and money changers sold off at high prices, causing prices to fall again. The market continued to fluctuate. In the afternoon, investor sentiment was uncertain, the market was sluggish, and transactions were very rare. The demand for British and American gold pounds was not high. The flow of British and American gold notes was still active, and foreign banks actively absorbed them, leading to a firm trend. There were very few transactions at the association. Only Hengmao sold and Xiangkang bought 20 American gold pounds. Yesterday's market prices showed an increase of 1 cent for British gold notes, 3 cents for American gold notes, 1 cent for Singapore notes, and a decrease of 5 cents for Dutch notes. Canadian notes increased by 2 cents. There were no changes in other currencies.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Unchanged</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bank drafts remained unchanged, still at 50 yuan and 2.25 cents per thousand yuan, similar to the price last Saturday.</p>
<h3>Yarn &amp; Cotton: Inventory Accumulates Daily, Yarn Prices Decline Sharply, 20-Count Shuangma Falls Below 10 Yuan, Potential for Equalization of Chinese and Japanese Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline, and the downward trend intensified. This was due to sluggish demand and difficult transportation, leading to a daily increase in existing stock. Furthermore, warehouse owners, recognizing the unfavorable environment, were reluctantly selling off previously stored goods. Banks were also trying to unload their holdings, further exacerbating the oversupply situation in the market. As a result, market prices declined sharply. Most market brokers were entrusted to sell, causing the market to become chaotic and exhibiting clear signs of panic. Market prices declined steadily. 20-count Shuangma yarn was generally regarded as the standard by speculators, and the large number of long and short positions amplified the downward trend. The prices at the foreign warehouses had broken through the 370 yuan mark, with the lowest price reaching 367 yuan in the afternoon, a drop of 10 yuan compared to the previous day. However, buyers were scarce and hesitant to try, reflecting the extreme level of fear.</p>
<p>Regarding the current yarn situation, few industry insiders expressed optimism at the opening of the market this morning. Most stated that the demand was too weak and that it was difficult to maintain a foothold in the market. Most were also disheartened. The opening price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was slightly lower at 376 yuan, with 15 bales traded among peers. Shortly after, reports of weak sales caused market prices to decline steadily. The market only heard selling voices and saw no buyers. The price kept going lower. The lowest price reached 371.5 yuan, with warehouse prices at 370 yuan. Afterwards, some bulls bought, pushing the price back up by 2 yuan. The current price was 373.5 yuan. In the afternoon, the market was deserted, with few people around. Market prices immediately fell by 3-4 yuan, and selling pressure suddenly increased, further weakening the situation. Due to certain rumors, the closing price for 20-count Shuangma yarn was 367 yuan, with warehouse prices at only 366.5 yuan. In the end, the total trading volume for various syndicates in the morning was 1,605 bales. The price of 20-count Shuangma yarn fell by 10.05 yuan, Tiannv by 8.5 yuan, Muyang by 6 yuan, and others by 4-5 yuan. The decline in 10-count coarse yarn was more moderate, only 2-3 yuan, due to uninterrupted sales in Tianjin. Shenxin Factory opened with 250 bales of 10-count Tongzijun yarn at a price of 289 yuan. Yesterday, 30 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped from Sichuan to Wenzhou, and today 10 pieces of yarn will be shipped to Hong Kong and 200 pieces to Shantou. The volume of yarn purchased by various syndicates is listed on the left: Peers: 760; Fujian: 25; Shantou: 35; Tianjin: 545; Yunnan: 115; Hong Kong: 105; Wenzhou: 10; Inland: 10; Total: 1,605</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market remained stable, as investors were optimistic and large players were mostly in long positions. As a result, the frequent declines in Chinese yarn did not affect Japanese yarn. Some said that Chinese and Japanese yarn prices may equalize in the future, so the price of yarn for the following month is expected to remain strong. The current price for 20-count Shuiyue yarn is 390 yuan, and the current price for 20-count Lanfeng yarn is 331 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Also Falls with Yarn, Factory Purchases Halt</h3>
<p>Regarding the external cotton market, New York cotton prices initially rose due to positive livestock feed reports and slight purchases from Wall Street. However, most industry players adopted a wait-and-see attitude towards the cotton market, awaiting developments in Washington. However, the information coming out of Washington was extremely contradictory, with reports of the Smith proposal being implemented and rumors of the US government's cotton export subsidy bill being passed by Congress, causing considerable uncertainty. Yesterday, New York rose 2 points per pound, and Indian White Baloch rose sharply by 2.5 rupees in April and May due to speculative manipulation. Egyptian rose 10 points per pound. Yesterday, the foreign exchange market was slightly tight. Converted to legal currency, cotton prices increased by 0.5 yuan per bale for American and Brazilian cotton, 1 yuan for Indian cotton, and 1 yuan for Egyptian cotton.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai cotton market, as yarn prices have been falling for five consecutive days, and rumors of negative news from Nanchang spread yesterday, causing yarn prices to fall another 10 yuan, most factories have halted their purchases of raw cotton. However, the cotton inventory of each factory is very low, and the Indian cotton ordered earlier has not been delivered on time, causing considerable anxiety. In the future, attention will be shifted to American cotton. Yesterday's prices of external cotton are listed below: Raw Material - Grade - Delivered to Factory Including Tax; 60-count Egyptian Cotton, High Grade - 107.10; Also, Medium Grade - 104.20; 80-count, High Grade - 131.00; Also, Medium Grade - 120.85; 20-count American Mitterlin - 84.30; Also, Low Grade - 71.20; 32-count, 93.00; Also, Low Grade - 82.15; 42-count, 94.85; Also, Low Grade - 83.05; Also, South American Brazilian Cotton, High Grade - 88.60; Also, Medium Grade - 85.30; Also, Low Grade - 76.15; 50-count, Indian Pingguoer - 62.50; 16-count, Indian Omala - 65.10; 20-count, 72.85; 24-count, Indian White Baloch - 80.25; 32-count, American Xinter - 85.45; 32-count, American Pengjiapu - 89.85; 42-count, American Pengjiapu - 89.85</p>
<p>The business of domestic cotton is increasingly sluggish. However, the demand for velvet cotton is still relatively strong. Market sentiment has slightly eased due to the continuous sharp decline in the yarn market, but cotton inventories are weak, so the decline is minimal. Huoji fell by 2.5 cents compared to the weekend, and Tonghua fell by 5 cents. The source of supply from Subei is gradually becoming smoother. Yesterday and today, 1,372 bales of Tongzhou Xiasha cotton arrived. The current cotton trading situation is as follows: 5,800 bales of Zhejiang cotton arrived; Tongzhou cotton, 79.50 yuan, purchased by peers, 170 bales, bank transfer, warehouse delivery; Huoji cotton, 71.25 yuan, also, 1,000 bales, cash; Also Huoji cotton, 72.00 yuan, also, 1,000 bales, cash; Te Yao Yi, 67.00 yuan, purchased by Yong'an Factory, 1,000 bales, bank transfer, delivered to factory.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Singapore Purchases of Colored Bleached Cloth are Strong</h3>
<p>The situation in Zhejiang and Eastern China has stabilized. Shipping to Ningbo and other ports has returned to normal. Local sales have been reduced because buyers from Hunan and Jiangxi have stopped purchasing, and the sales area has shrunk. Furthermore, the exchange rate between Shanghai and Ningbo has recently risen sharply from 23 yuan per thousand to 69 yuan per thousand. As a result, most of the ordered goods have been retained in Shanghai. Only a small portion of the goods that are urgently needed for sales are still being shipped. Guangdong merchants continued to purchase 150-160 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill of various brands, including Fugui, Diqiu, Jiaopinglian, and Renzhong, and over 100 cases of colored cloth, colored twill, and poplin. Dyeing factories in this street purchased 150 pieces of undyed fine twill. The sales of woven cloth and fine cloth are weak. Retailers and warehouse owners have been selling off their holdings at reduced prices of 5-10 cents in recent days. Merchants from Sichuan and Yunnan are still actively purchasing over 100 cases of bleached cloth, bleached twill, colored cloth, and printed cloth. Singapore purchased over 1,000 pieces of colored cloth, bleached cloth, and colored twill from overseas. The sales of colored cloth and bleached dyed cloth have remained largely unchanged, while the sales of bleached fine twill have increased by 10 cents per piece due to the rising prices of undyed cloth.</p>
<p>The market for white cloth from Eastern China is weak. The sales of fine cloth and fine twill have decreased by about 5 cents per piece. 12-pound Longzhao fine cloth and fine twill are both selling for 12 yuan in the market. There is little trading with foreign merchants. Dyeing businesses in this street continued to purchase over 800 pieces of various brands of cloth.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 168 pieces of imported piece goods arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin. Today (28th), 350 pieces will be exported to Shantou, and 55 pieces will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Lack of Spring Overcoat Materials, Non-Chinese and Non-Western Styles Suddenly Unpopular</h3>
<p>The retail and wholesale trade of woolens and fabrics remained strong yesterday. There is a shortage of spring overcoat materials in the market, creating opportunities for the sale of Harris Homespun and other materials. Yesterday, ordinary Harris Homespun from England was selling for 8.5 yuan, and No. 1 Harris from England was selling for 10 yuan wholesale. Domestic Tianjin Renli plain-colored fabrics were selling for 5.5 yuan, and plaid fabrics were selling for 6.5 yuan.</p>
<p>The sales of non-Chinese and non-Western fabrics have been lacking recently. There have been few large transactions, except for a small number of retail sales. It is rumored that many merchants have been warned to donate to relief organizations such as the Red Cross and refugee organizations, which has caused them to become fearful.</p>
<h3>Food: Affected by Dumping of Foreign Flour, Local Flour Mills Reduce Prices Again, Northern Merchants' Prices Only 4.40 Yuan, Large Quantities of Foreign Flour Sold to the North</h3>
<p>The prices of flour mills continued to fall sharply. Because of foreign flour dumping, local merchants' demand for local flour has decreased daily. Forced by the environment, each factory had no choice but to cut prices to compete with foreign flour. Therefore, yesterday's factory price for No. 2 flour, except the wholesale price which decreased by 5 cents to 4.55 yuan, was only 4.5 yuan for merchants' prices. It was also heard that Northern merchants had a special price of 4.4 yuan for Pao Che flour. The market situation was quite chaotic. The total volume of transactions was over 100,000 bags including those from local and Northern merchants. Because of continuous arrivals of foreign flour, the future of local flour may be difficult to develop for the time being. Today, 17,500 bags of flour and 8,500 bags of bran will be shipped to Shantou.</p>
<p>The market situation for foreign flour is that existing orders remain strong, because the production price has remained steady these days. The price of May delivery foreign flour needs to be 4.6 yuan per bag. Buyers are afraid of being crowded out when the new wheat arrives, so there have not been any new transactions. As for the existing supply in the market, it is becoming increasingly abundant. Recently, many Northern merchants have been buying foreign flour in Shanghai. Yesterday, Zhenxing Company sold 20,000-30,000 bags of Bat Brand Standard No. 2 foreign flour to Northern merchants. The price increased from 4.4 yuan to 4.5 yuan (bank transfer price). The retail sales of existing foreign flour are relatively flat because the price of local flour is already lower than foreign flour.</p>
<p>The wheat market remains stagnant. There are very few retail arrivals. Most of it is directly sent to factories and assigned customers. In the official market, amid the falling price of flour, there may still be a fight.</p>
<h3>Locally Produced Xian Rice Rises</h3>
<p>The purchases of locally produced Xian rice are active by both merchants and hoarders. Retail sales in this street are also very fragrant because the price of locally produced Xian rice is more suitable and tastes extremely delicious. Therefore, the total daily transaction volume increased to 3,600-3,700 bags. The high and decided prices from each stall unanimously increased. Nanjing Xian rice opened at 13.15 yuan to 12.89 yuan. Wu Xian ranged from 12.89 yuan to 12.35 yuan. Prices were 10-15 cents higher than the previous day's prices. Saigon rice, after opening at a low price last week, retail sales gradually became active. Yesterday, as locally produced Xian rice continued to rise, the seller's asking price increased to 17.12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japonica Rice Sales in Street are Normal</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sources of supply from each syndicate, He Xia, arrived with over 1,000 bags of rice. The market sentiment was still good in the early morning. Traders were actively buying, so the situation continued to be tight. The prices of thick and thin Japonica rice were slightly higher by a few cents to 10 cents. However, because local sales were normal, the evening market became flat. The situation of Du Yang Jian Pu Jian was similar to that of the Japonica rice market. The price still remained in equilibrium between supply and demand, maintaining the original price.</p>
<h3>Australian Wheat Continues to Arrive, 260,000 Bags of American Flour Arrive in Shanghai, The Highest Import This Month</h3>
<p>The continuous arrival of Australian wheat has already been noted in this newspaper. The Barbara Marie of Paulie Foreign Firm arrived with 7,500 tons of foreign wheat. It is berthed at the 13th or 14th buoy, and unloading is underway. It is heard that the company will have the Solvus ship with wheat arriving in Shanghai on the 5th of next month. The quantity has not been confirmed. Regarding the recent rumor that 260,000 bags of American wheat flour have arrived in Shanghai, after inquiring with each party, there has not been such a large volume of wheat flour imported this month. Perhaps it is still en route. According to the shipping industry, it is probably impossible for a ship to carry such a large quantity (of bags).</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Crude Oil Rises Sharply with a Slight Decline, Soybean Oil is Controlled by Japanese Merchants, Soybean Cake Trading is Still Lively</h3>
<p>Crude Oil: The market situation has weakened because Qingdao has indicated that it can release the previously agreed-upon oil, so people's hearts are tired. However, under the heavy taxation of the unified system, the selling price is probably not easy to be too cheap. Yesterday, only 150 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were sold at a price of 29 yuan and 28.8 yuan. This fell 2 cents from the weekend.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil: The market situation is entirely controlled by Dalian. The market was slightly soft in the early morning, causing people to be uneasy. Later, positive news was frequently transmitted from Dalian, and the market atmosphere improved, with strong buying enthusiasm and strong price increases. The final price increased by 30-50 cents compared to last weekend. However, at the close of the market, Xintai, operated by a Japanese merchant, sold 300-400 barrels for May delivery at a price of 32.3 yuan, which was 6 cents different from the highest price of the day. Therefore, the underlying trend today may be unstable. Yesterday, the total market traded 200 cans of factory-canned oil at a price of 26.8 yuan, 100 pieces of Fengnian oil, 50 pieces of Yanqi oil, and 50 pieces of Da Xiao oil. The total amount of existing Dalian oil agreed to be opened for delivery was over 2,000 barrels.</p>
<p>Soybean Cake: For existing stock, Quanzhou merchants purchased 1,500 pieces of Changzhou Sipai cake at a price of 3.39 yuan, and 2,000 pieces of Da You brand cake at a price of 3.47 yuan and 3.48 yuan. A batch of Jiangbei Xiaobing was traded on Sunday, with the price being the original price of 6 cents. Both the spot price and the futures transaction were lively, and the market was slightly tighter. Transactions for April delivery were 3,000 pieces at a price of 3.13 yuan. Transactions for May delivery were 3,000 pieces at a price of 3.15 yuan. Transactions for June delivery were over 20,000 pieces at a price of 3.17 yuan and 3.18 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Yellow Soybeans Sell Well and Rise Sharply, Futures Dalian Soybeans Market Stalls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, both futures and spot yellow soybeans turned to rise. The Dalian futures soybeans for April delivery rose due to the rise in the Dalian market. Japanese merchants had no intention to sell, and the market stalled. Only one car was traded at a price of 8.33 yuan, which was 3 cents higher than last Saturday. Guangxia local merchants actively purchased existing soybeans. In a situation with few goods, the market rose sharply by 7-8 cents. One car of Dalian soybeans was traded at a price of 8.44 yuan, and 1,300-1,400 bags of Chongming Sha Huang were sold at a price ranging from 8.3 yuan to 8.57 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 885 bags of soybeans arrived from Tianjin, and today 600 bags will be shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaozhou Sugar Production Prices Remain Stable</h3>

A few bags of Qing slices were offered at 11.3 yuan, based on Chaozhou standards. According to Shantou telegrams, the train station was indeed bombed, but it was not related to the city, so the market price was not greatly affected. It was found that 990 bags of sugar arrived in Shantou yesterday, and another 2,585 bags were transported from Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Silk &amp; Tea: Double Palace Factory Silk Rises to 1,040 Yuan</h3>
<p>The overseas silk market, the opening price in Yokohama has slightly decreased, spot and near-term futures each fell by over ten yuan, long-term futures are slightly two yuan, New York Saturday no market, the Shanghai silk market still lacks turning points, factory silk and native silk foreign merchants are not asking. Only French banks traded ten bundles of Shandong yellow factory silk. The 1416 patterned opened at 1540 yuan, the price is stable, Non-Chinese merchants have a considerable appetite for Shuang Gong factory silk, in recent days, the number of purchases is no less than forty or fifty bundles, the Beauty brand of 6060 pattern rose to 1040 yuan, a new record opened for Shuang Gong silk, because supply is not sufficient for demand. Again, yesterday five pieces of Hu silk were transported to Europe, of which, the tea exported by this place yesterday were 885 boxes, transported to Europe, today (28th) two pieces were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Coal: Pacific Bituminous Coal Newly Arrived with Over 1,000 Tons</h3>
<p>The situation in the coal market is very clever, the volume of sales to each factory is vast, the purchasing intention of merchants is also thick, therefore, the circulating goods in the market feel lacking again. Some time ago, a foreign firm had Pacific bituminous coal newly arrived, lumps and powder together were over 1,000 tons, at the wharf in Pudong, entrusted to a certain business to manage the sale, the price per ton, was 37 yuan for the face lumps, 35 yuan for the general coal, 34 yuan for the coal powder, delivery from the warehouse, and other fees were added.</p>
<h3>Metals: Raw Material is Lacking in 本釘, Production From Domestic Factories is Extremely Little</h3>
<p>Due to the raw material shortage for 本廠元釘 (盘元及元丝, coiled steel and round steel), the factory's output is extremely little, and the market price is indeed good, each barrel opened for 16.75 yuan (蓓司, Bes), only 16.5 yuan were also slightly sold, but merchants hardly buy, only retailers are buying a little, and only about 100担 were traded yesterday.</p>

<h3>Hua Army in Eastern Zhejiang Firmly Defends Original Positions; Japanese Merchants in Hangzhou Prepare to Withdraw; Guerrilla Warfare to be Launched in Western Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army attempted something in Eastern Zhejiang and secretly landed at Wenjia Yan, Dongsha Zhou, on the banks of the Fuchun River, they have been completely annihilated after a fierce counterattack by the garrison. To contain Japanese forces, the Chinese army has gathered a large force to launch a general offensive towards Hangzhou, preparing for a large-scale attack. According to a telegram received by sources in this city, a certain unit of the Chinese army has secretly crossed the Qiantang River and advanced to the north bank, adopting a large encirclement strategy against Hangzhou. As for the coastal areas of Eastern Zhejiang, the troops of Generals Huang Shaohong and Liu Jianxu, as well as the Eastern Zhejiang Security Brigade, are stationed in various key areas with substantial strength. Although the military situation in Jiangxi Province is tense, it is not affected.</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants in Hangzhou Prepare to Withdraw</p>
<p>According to a certain passenger who arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou yesterday morning, after Hangzhou fell, the Japanese established a puppet regime and actively tried to revitalize the city. However, there are few Chinese residents, and those who remain are mostly from the poor class. The majority of residents are Japanese. The Qixiaying and Yanling Road areas of Hangzhou, which used to be bustling, are now mostly occupied by Japanese who have forcibly seized shop bases to open stores. Since the outbreak of the Eastern Zhejiang war, the previously quiet Eastern Front has become tense again. The Chinese army has crossed the river to launch a general offensive against Hangzhou, so the Japanese army in Hangzhou is extremely frightened. Most Japanese merchants have packed their bags and are preparing to evacuate when necessary. Many Chinese residents living in Zha Kou and other places are also fleeing, creating a rather chaotic situation.</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Bomb Yangguang Mountain in Yuyao</p>
<p>Furthermore, according to a telegram received by the aviation industry from Ningbo, at 4 PM on the 26th, three Japanese planes flew over Yuyao and dropped twelve bombs on Yangguang Mountain. It is reported that most of them landed in the wilderness, causing little damage. It is also learned that a large number of Japanese warships are still gathering in Hangzhou Bay, attempting something in Eastern Zhejiang. On the evening of the 24th, they shelled Linshan An and other places in Yaobei Township on the south bank of Yuyao. The Chinese garrison calmly awaited and did not retaliate.</p>
<p>Guerrilla Warfare to be Launched in Western Zhejiang</p>
<p>Zhou Enlai, Deputy Minister of the Political Department of the Military Affairs Commission, has been inspecting defenses in Zhejiang with Chairman Huang Shaohong for several days and is very busy. After returning to his hometown province within days to visit relatives, he will go to southern Anhui for inspection and meet with Chairman Xiong Shihui of Jiangxi in Nanchang. Zhou has already drafted a work plan to dispatch a part of the New Fourth Army of southern Anhui to Zhejiang Province to launch guerrilla warfare. He is currently discussing it with Commander Gu and Commander-in-Chief Liu Jianxu, and it will be implemented soon. The military defenses of Zhejiang Province will become more solid in the future. As for the current allocation of military defense duties: (1) The coast is garrisoned by the troops of the Wenzhou-Taizhou and Ningbo defense command headquarters, and the security team of Xuan Tiewu, director of the Zhejiang Security Department; (2) Defensive works have been built on the south bank of the Qiantang River, garrisoned by the troops of Zhejiang Provincial Chairman Huang Shaohong; (3) The troops of Xiang Army's Liu Jianxu are garrisoned along the Fuchun River and other places. A Japanese invasion is definitely out of the question.</p>
<p>Japanese Warship Damaged Outside Zhenhai Port</p>
<p>On the evening of the 24th, several Japanese warships were anchored in the waters off Ligang outside Zhenhai Port. The Zhenhai Fortress artillery was ordered to open fire and bombard the Japanese warships. It is reported that one ship was hit by artillery shells and damaged. The Japanese warships outside Zhenhai Port have now sailed elsewhere, but Japanese warships frequently patrol the waters off Eastern Zhejiang. More than ten Japanese warships are concentrated in Hangzhou Bay and have not sailed elsewhere. A Japanese warship sailed from the northeast to the waters off Mount Putuo Luojia in the early morning and anchored near Xiadang. It set sail that night. The Japanese aircraft carrier anchored off Chumen in Wenzhou has also sailed elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Jiangnan Shipyard Destroyed by Plainclothes Team; Japanese Army Blockades Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway; Japanese Warship at Yanglinkou Attacked by Gunfire</h3>
<p>The Nanshi area was suddenly under martial law the day before yesterday (the 26th), and water and land transportation on the Jiangmian River above the 16th Pier was also blockaded by the Japanese army. According to investigations, the night before last (the 25th), a Chinese plainclothes team of over a hundred people surrounded the Jiangnan Shipyard, which was occupied by the Japanese army, and launched a fierce attack on the shipyard. Although the Japanese troops stationed there resisted with all their might, they failed to drive away the plainclothes team. As a result, more than ten Japanese soldiers were killed, and the plainclothes team left unscathed. Most of the shipyard was destroyed. Afterwards, the Japanese announced martial law and searched pedestrians, but found nothing. Because "face" was at stake, the incident was not disclosed.</p>
<p>Strafing a Transport Ship</p>
<p>The Japanese No. 1 transport ship, carrying military supplies and food, sailed from the Huishan Wharf to Jiangbei to resupply the Japanese army. The day before yesterday (the 25th), when it sailed to Yanglinkou, it was strafed by guerrillas using dense machine-gun fire. Dozens of Japanese soldiers drowned, and the losses were enormous.</p>
<p>Blockading the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road</p>
<p>Since the Central Regular Army and guerrillas have advanced in a roundabout way towards the Jiangnan area, the Japanese are extremely alarmed. The Japanese army in Hangzhou has blockaded the traffic on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, attempting to cut off the connection between the Regular Army and the guerrillas, and has piled up a large number of obstacles. Jisha Island, which is more than 200 miles away from Shanghai in the Zhejiang sea, is now garrisoned by a powerful Chinese guerrilla force, which has expanded its organization and gathered over</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Attacks Hengsha Island; Suddenly Retreats Before Battle; Gale and Rain Rendered Effort Fruitless; Forced Puppet Troops Rejoice</h3>
<p>Two Hundred</p>
<p>Strong, with substantial strength. It also has a large marine sailing fleet engaged in maritime guerrilla warfare, operating from time to time outside the mouth of the Yangtze River, posing a major threat to the Japanese. The commander of the Shanghai Japanese Naval Landing Forces, Totsudo, suddenly drew 2,000 naval personnel on the evening of the 24th, bringing small steel cannons, light and heavy machine guns, and other weapons, and also</p>
<p>Conscripted En Masse</p>
<p>A hundred and fifty pseudo "members" of the pseudo-Greater Shanghai Youth Corps, which the pseudo-"municipal government" had organized last year, were attached to the ship to attack the island. Fearing that the shoals around the island would make it difficult to attack, they also transported 40 rubber dinghies. They also drew Japanese translators and newly organized pseudo-"Constitutional Police" from various places to avoid language barriers. When these pseudo-personnel departed, except for the translators, the rest were forced to carry short guns and grenades, but the mission was not specified. On the 25th, the transport ship had already arrived outside Hengsha Island and was lowering the rubber boats one by one in order to</p>
<p>Transport Troops to Attack</p>
<p>They also instructed the pseudo-"Youth Corps members" to be the vanguard. At that time, the guerrillas on the island, seeing the Japanese action, were all waiting in strict array on the beach. Just as a gale and rain were raging, fearing that landing on the island would result in huge losses, they ordered a retreat to Shanghai, each returning to their original defense, canceling the attack on the island. The pseudo-"Youth Corps members" who were forced to fight were extremely frightened and returned, all rejoicing and congratulating each other. Fearing that the Japanese army would conscript them a second time, many fled in the previous two days.</p>
<h3>More Than 30,000 Wounded Japanese Soldiers Remain in Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to someone from Hongkou, the Gongda Spinning Factory has been converted into a storage depot for aircraft materials and ammunition. But since the start of the Yangtze River war, Japanese military hospitals everywhere have been overflowing, unable to accommodate them. Even in Shanghai, the hospitals in Longhua and other places in Nanshi, and one place in Wusong, were already full. Therefore, the Gongda Spinning Factory, the largest building in Hongkou, was converted into a Japanese military hospital. In the months since, it has accommodated wounded soldiers. Excluding deaths, there are currently over 35,000 people.</p>
<h3>Italian Ambassador Left Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>The English-language "North China Daily News" reported that the Italian Ambassador to China, Marcucci, who had not yet presented his credentials to Chongqing, suddenly left Shanghai on the cruiser "Eritrea" at 1:30 PM today (the 27th). His destination has not been announced.</p>
<h3>Chinese Cotton Mills Lack Raw Materials; Order Foreign Cotton for Supply; Foreign Cotton Imports Have Increased Sharply Since January; Domestic Cotton Exported to Japan for Manufacturing Ammunition</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese puppet regime controlled cotton in its occupied areas, the amount of cotton exported to Japan has increased sharply. Cotton mills in Shanghai were forced to order foreign cotton, which has been shipped to Shanghai in batches since January of this year. Domestic cotton exported to Japan is used for manufacturing ammunition and as textile raw materials. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Ordering Foreign Cotton to Transport to Shanghai for Supply</p>
<p>Due to the Japanese puppet regime's control over cotton in the occupied areas, the various Chinese cotton mills in Shanghai could not transport it to Shanghai. At the same time, the government banned the transportation of cotton to Shanghai because it is a raw material for ammunition, resulting in a shortage of raw materials for the mills. They had no choice but to order foreign cotton from India and other places. In January and February of this year, imported cotton totaled 167,785 metric tons, valued at 11,800,302 yuan in national currency. India accounted for the most, with 82,714 metric tons, followed by Brazil with 21,271 metric tons, and then Egypt with 18,193 metric tons.</p>
<p>Japanese Puppet Regime Controls Large Quantities to be Transported to Japan</p>
<p>The Japanese puppet regime controlled cotton in its occupied areas and loaded it onto Japanese ships to be transported to Japan to supply textile raw materials and manufacture ammunition. In 1938, the total amount exported to Japan, the Kwantung Leased Territory, Korea, and Taiwan was 1,217,471 metric tons, valued at 89,897,717 yuan in national currency. From January to February of this year, the total was 36,768 metric tons, valued at 2,926,606 yuan in national currency. Japanese merchants have established cotton management agencies in Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, Jinan, Shanghai, and other places to control transportation and sales.</p>
<h3>Flags to be Lowered at Half-Mast Tomorrow by All Sectors to Commemorate Huanghuagang Martyrs; The Seventy-Two Martyrs Bravely Sacrificed Their Lives, Their Spirit is Great; All Sectors Determined to Carry on Their Legacy to Complete the National Reconstruction</h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the Memorial Day of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang. All sectors of the city have decided to mourn in unison. The entire city will automatically lower flags to half-mast, suspend entertainment, and promote the relief donation movement and the national spiritual mobilization. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Brief History of the Sacrifice of Revolutionary Martyrs</p>
<p>The Huanghuagang Uprising was a sequel to the uprising of the Guangdong New Army two years before the founding of the Republic of China. The location of the uprising was in Guangzhou, and the general headquarters for planning the uprising was set up in Hong Kong, with the martyr Huang Xing as the commander-in-chief. Xie Liangmu raised tens of thousands of dollars from overseas Chinese in Nanyang as funding. At the time of the uprising, Mr. Huang Xing led more than a hundred comrades to attack the Governor-General's Office. Later, because the Governor-General of Guangdong, Zhang Mingqi, transferred troops to encircle and suppress them, the revolutionaries were ultimately defeated due to numerical inferiority. Afterwards, the Governor-General of Guangdong implemented even more terrifying policies, and party members and civilians with shaved hair were killed. After the event, seventy-two bodies were recovered and buried in Huanghuagang. However, because of the Huanghuagang Uprising, the tide of revolutionary anger among the Chinese people was further aroused, and the belief in the Three People's Principles penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people, finally leading to the Wuchang Uprising on October 10th and the founding of the Republic of China. Therefore, the sacrifice of the Seventy-Two Martyrs of Huanghuagang occupies a glorious and great page in the history of the Chinese Revolution.</p>
<p>Flags Lowered, Entertainment Suspended by All Sectors</p>
<p>All sectors of this city believe that the revolutionary martyrs of Huanghuagang bravely sacrificed their lives to complete a great mission, and their spirit will last forever. During this period of the War of Resistance against Japan, when the national crisis is severe, remembering the martyrs inspires infinite admiration and worship. Therefore, all groups, schools, shops, and households in the city have decided to automatically lower flags to half-mast tomorrow and suspend the entertainment industry. The Jianghai Customs, the Post Office, and the courts of the two special districts will all be closed as usual. Schools will also hold memorial ceremonies to express condolences and mourn.</p>
<p>Thrifty Relief, Spiritual Mobilization</p>
<p>It is also learned that the citizens of this city, although living on an isolated island, deeply feel the suffocation of the atmosphere and the harshness of the environment. However, they have spared no effort in advocating and implementing thrift and relief for refugees. The total amount of monthly donations reaches more than 100,000 yuan. Due to the large number of refugees, the economy is still tight, so fundraising work continues to reduce the burden on the government. At the same time, in order to uphold the government's policy of resistance to Japan and inherit the revolutionary legacy of the martyrs to complete the great cause of national reconstruction, all groups in agriculture, industry, commerce, and education have decided to actively promote national spiritual mobilization to concentrate their strength and strive for final victory.</p>
<h3>After Stipulating Methods for Repaying Debts with Customs Duties, Ministry of Finance Strives to Maintain Creditworthiness; Outstanding British and French Debts Still to be Repaid; Central Bank Requests Instructions from Ministry Regarding Gold Standard Payment Method</h3>
<p>In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has always fulfilled its debt repayments on schedule. Since announcing the methods for repaying debts with customs duties on January 15th, it has now been decided to handle the matter in the same way due to the interception of salt taxes in various places by the Japanese, and to formulate an appropriate method that conforms to reality in order to maintain creditworthiness. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Foreign Debts Guaranteed by Salt Tax Revenue</p>
<p>As of June 1937, the foreign debts guaranteed by salt tax revenue included: (1) the 1908 Anglo-French loan of £500,000; (2) the 1912 Crisp Loan of £3,930,837; (3) the 1911 Hukuang Railway Loan of £5,656,000; (4) the Vickers Marconi Loan of £2,403,200; and (5) the 1919 Chicago Bank Loan of $5,500,000. The total was £12,490,037 and $5,500,000.</p>
<p>Government Strives to Maintain Creditworthiness</p>
<p>Although the Ministry of Finance has stipulated methods for repaying various debts guaranteed by customs duties and salt tax revenue, in order to maintain creditworthiness, the debts guaranteed by surplus customs duties that were due at the end of January, as well as the Fuxing Loan due at the end of February and the Jinlong Loan due at the end of March, will still be subsidized by the central government and repaid as usual. As for the Anglo-French loan guaranteed by salt tax revenue that is due on April 15th and the Crisp Loan due at the end of March, they will still be repaid as usual. As for the measures taken for various debts guaranteed by customs duties and salt tax revenue, they were actually due to environmental circumstances. The Ministry is now formulating an appropriate method that conforms to reality to maintain China's creditworthiness.</p>
<p>Gold Standard Payment for Jinlong Loan, Instructions Requested from Chongqing by Telegram</p>
<p>A "New Voices" reporter learned from banking circles yesterday that the eleventh repayment of principal and interest on the financial long-term public debt guaranteed by surplus customs duties, which is scheduled to be paid at the end of March, was drawn by the National Debt Fund Management Committee in Shanghai on March 10th. In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has decided to fully repay it upon maturity. Regarding the payment method, it has not yet been issued. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank has already telegraphed the head office to request instructions on the payment method and has decided to start payment on March 31st after receiving the order. It is reported that the principal and interest due for the Jinlong Loan are originally 1,125,000 yuan for the principal and 421,875 yuan for the interest.</p>
<p>Uniform Periodic Lottery for Category C Bonds</p>
<p>The seventh repayment of the principal of the Category C bonds of the 1936 Unification Public Bonds will be drawn in Shanghai on April 10th under the order of the National Debt Fund Management Committee. The date of repayment of principal and interest is July 31st. The payments will be made by the Central Bank and its commissioned Bank of China and Bank of Communications, as well as the Central Trust. The amount of the seventh repayment of principal and interest for various Unified Bonds is: (1) Category A: principal of 3,600,000 yuan, interest of 4,252,500 yuan; (2) Category B: principal of 1,350,000 yuan, interest of 4,365,000 yuan; (3) Category C: principal of 2,800,000 yuan, interest of 10,290,000 yuan; (4) Category D: principal of 4,400,000 yuan, interest of 16,005,000 yuan; (5) Category E: principal of 2,080,000 yuan, interest of 7,566,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Misfortune of Japanese Banks: Overt Profits, Covert Losses</h3>
<p>According to a report in the French "Peiping Political and Economic News," based on the latest statistics released by the Japanese, the total profits of various privately owned Japanese banks, such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi, in 1938 were 5,866,600 Japanese yen. However, it is reported that the total amount of their bad debts reached 8,504,000 Japanese yen. Because of this, all Japanese banks are overtly profitable but covertly losing money, and almost all of their reserve funds have been converted into public bonds.</p>
<h3>Post Office Holiday Notice</h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Notice No. 1534: "It has been determined that the 29th of this month is a regular holiday for this Bureau. The office hours of all sections and branches of this Bureau shall follow the established Sunday schedule. This notice is hereby given for general information.

<h3>Japanese Traffic Regulations Ineffective; Fail to Prevent Accidents; Jewish Car Badly Damaged, Japanese Public Bus Should Be Responsible</h3>
<p>The "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that the strict traffic regulations recently implemented by the Japanese authorities in Hongkou and Huishan, as well as other areas under their control, have failed to prevent traffic accidents. Shortly after 2 PM yesterday (the 26th), two public buses collided at the intersection of Broadway Road and Minhang Road. One of the buses was operated by the Japanese, running on a circular route through the main roads of the areas north of the Suzhou Creek. The other bus was carrying Jewish refugees living in the northern district to and from the Waibaidu Bridge. According to witnesses, the Japanese bus was stopped at the station on Broadway Road almost directly opposite Minhang Road, while the Jewish bus was driving down Broadway Road towards the Waibaidu Bridge. Then the Japanese bus started to move, and without paying attention to the Jewish bus, attempted to turn into Minhang Road, colliding with the Jewish bus, causing significant damage to the protective structures and the left side panel. Fortunately, no one was injured. If the two vehicles had not been moving slower, there might have been more serious consequences. There are 3,000 Jewish refugees living in the northern district. Because they often go to the south of the bridge, the committee in charge of their welfare decided some time ago to purchase a bus themselves to save money. It is said that the bus travels several fixed routes every day. It is reported that yesterday's accident is being investigated today by the Public Concession Police Department and the Japanese Consulate's General Affairs Section.</p>
<h3>Bean and Rice Industry Plans to Organize a Brokerage Friendship Association</h3>

<h3>Commissioned Relief; Group Ancestral Worship; Puan Taoist Temple Held at the Jueyuan in Hart Road</h3>
<p>This year's Puan Taoist Temple, because of the current Qingming Festival this spring, realized that it would be very inconvenient for people from all walks of life to go to various places to sweep tombs or worship ancestors at home. Therefore, it is permitted to hold a large-scale group ancestral worship on April 6th (Qingming) at the Buddhist Pure Land Society in the Jueyuan on Hart Road. The ceremony is solemn and grand. High monks chant scriptures day and night and provide vegetarian lunches. A percentage of the proceeds will be donated to help refugees.

The fee for righteous recommendations is only 5 yuan in national currency per lotus seat, and the fee for supplementary recommendations is only 2 yuan. There are no other charges. However, because Qingming is near, those who wish to participate must first register at the Puan Taoist Temple at 422 Hart Road. If it is inconvenient to travel far, call 30738, and a staff member will be sent to contact you. The charter will be sent upon request.</p>
<p>Refugee Egg-Cracking Work</p>
<p>There are still many refugees in the shelters of Shanghai, most of whom come from the countryside or are industrial and commercial people who have lost their jobs due to the war. If the able-bodied do not work, they will easily develop laziness. If relief is stopped, they will not be accustomed to the labor of the past and indulge in pleasure, which will harm society. The International Relief Committee of this city, in view of this, has expanded the original craft group, with Mr. Li Guiyong as the chairman and Mr. Zheng Wenhan as the director of the group, urging the various shelters to carry out various crafts. In addition to expanding the original embroidery, sock weaving, grass rope weaving, sewing, knitting, rattan, and straw mat crafts, recently, in view of the importance of training refugee skills, a radio training class and a soap-making training class have been held. Yesterday, cooperation was obtained from the Yumin Egg Factory to select male and female refugees in the first shelter on Masnan Road for egg-cracking work. It is said that each refugee earns 20 to 30 cents a day.</p>

<h3>Visiting the Refugee Camp Before Departure: French Commander Inspects Refugee Children, Believing China Will Ultimately Triumph – One of the Most Meaningful Days of His Service in China</h3>
<p>Colonel Bo Wenjie, commander of the French garrison in Shanghai, has served in China for many years with the French defense forces. He has a deep understanding of the Chinese people and has expressed his sympathy for China's resistance against Japan. During the "August 13th" Shanghai Battle, he led the French garrison in rescuing Chinese refugees with all his strength, for which he was deeply grateful by the Chinese government and people. Recently, as Colonel Bo's term of office neared its end and his return home approached, he made a special visit to express his concern for Chinese refugees. A few days ago, he went by a command vehicle to the International Relief Committee's First Refugee Camp on Route Massenet to observe the living conditions of the refugees. He was warmly received by Mrs. Pan Dayu, the director of the camp, and Father Mumu. Six hundred refugee children stood in two neat rows on both sides of the main road inside the camp, standing at attention and saluting with spirited bravery. Colonel Bo was deeply moved. He patted the refugee children and said, "Good chests, you will all be good soldiers!" He then handed his movie camera to Director Pan and, acting as the reviewing officer, inspected the refugee children, asking Director Pan to take photos of him as a memento. Afterwards, Director Pan led him on a tour of the entire camp. He highly praised the dedication of the camp staff and expressed to the refugees his absolute belief that China would ultimately be victorious. He bid farewell at a little after eleven o'clock. Upon leaving, he said to Director Pan, "This is the most meaningful day of my service in China!" He then sealed a check in an envelope and handed it to Mrs. Yu Gidan, asking her to purchase supplies to reward the refugee children on Easter.</p>

<h3>More Jade and Precious Stones Shipped to the United States for Exhibition – A Total of 7,200 Pieces Valued at Two Million Yuan</h3>
<p>The first and second batches of exhibits from Shanghai manufacturers for the U.S. World's Fair were shipped in January. The remaining jade and precious stones, etc., that could not be packed in time, after the efforts of the Shanghai Managers' Association and Mr. Lu Shou Lian, were shipped to the United States on the Changxing Company's Empress of Japan on the 19th of this month. A reporter from the New Voice News met with Mr. Lu at the International Hotel yesterday, who gave the following details:</p>
<p>Jade and Precious Stones Valued at Two Million</p>
<p>This third batch of jade and precious stones shipped to the United States for exhibition consists of 20 boxes, with more than 300 styles, totaling 7,200 pieces, including jade incense burners, crystals, jade artifacts, etc., valued at more than two million yuan.</p>
<p>Jade Manufacturer Sends Personnel to Oversee</p>
<p>Among them is a pair of antique jade palace lanterns, valued at more than 150,000 yuan. There is also a small jade pendant two inches high that can be worn on the chest, valued at US$15,000. All of the above jade and precious stones were handled by three major Shanghai companies: Gu Xianji, Jin Changhou, and Cui Huaxuan. The companies also sent four people, including Zhang Zitian, at their own expense to oversee everything.</p>
<p>Admission Tickets Collected for Viewing</p>
<p>The manufacturers participating in the U.S. World's Fair, along with the countries along the Pacific Ocean, are attending under the name of their countries. Only China, due to the wartime situation, is attending under the name of manufacturers. Therefore, there are some funding problems. Chinese merchants in the Americas must collect an additional 25 cents for entrance to "China Village" to help with expenses, but it was recently reduced to 10 cents to make it more accessible.</p>
<p>Tiantu MSG Sets Up Separate Exhibition</p>
<p>The owner of Tiantu MSG Factory took the Clipper to the United States specifically to exhibit the MSG business.

<p>Chinese Native Products Sold Out</p>
<p>After being designed and improved by the Shanghai Managers' Association, native products such as figurines and landscapes have also been shipped to the United States. It is said that Americans are very fond of Chinese art. Chinese landscape figurines have been sold out. This is due to the appropriate design of the Shanghai Managers' Association, which gave Americans a very good impression. In the future, if Chinese domestic products can sell well in the United States, the Shanghai Managers' Association will have played a significant role. It is said that the scale of the U.S. World's Fair is much larger than the past Chicago World's Fair. The Chinese domestic products shipped to the United States by Chinese manufacturers are guaranteed by the Shanghai Customs, with reduced export taxes. All jade and precious stones will be displayed in the "Emerald Heaven" room inside the pagoda of "China Village."</p>

<h3>Workers in Lost Timber Case Released</h3>
<p>Ye Linji, a Jiangbei carpenter foreman, recently built employee dormitories for the Rihua Yarn Factory on Rue Robert and Route de Say Zoong in Shanghai West. On the 19th of this month, Ye, because a large number of wooden boards were lost from his work site, suspected that they were stolen by workers from the Tongli Transportation Company who were sent to transport soil to the site.

<h3>Bank Clerk Hu Shoutian Embezzles Public Funds to Support a Prostitute; Arrested and Handed Over to the Court for Trial</h3>
<p>Hu Shoutian, a native of Ningbo (21 years old, residing at No. 96 Rue des Soeurs), was a clerk at the Bank of China branch at No. 624 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. He was fond of gambling and debauchery. He met and became acquainted with Wang Xiaoluan, an 18-year-old Yangzhou prostitute at No. 18, Lane 150, Route Bo ক্লark. Hu's meager salary was insufficient for her expenses. Hu then took advantage of the bank's procurement of official supplies and miscellaneous items, inflated expenses, submitted false accounts, and embezzled public funds to cover his expenses. From February 16th of this year to the present, he successively embezzled a huge sum of over 1,700 national currency. It was not until the 18th of this month that the manager of the branch discovered the situation and reported it to the French police, requesting an investigation. After receiving the report, the police sent detective Zhang Xiaofa to Wang Xiaoying's brothel on Route Bo ক্লark and arrested Hu Shoutian. He was taken to the police station, where he confessed that all the embezzled funds had been swindled away by Auntie Bian Er, the brothel madam, and squandered. The detective then went to the address, but the madam had already fled upon hearing the news. Yesterday, the police transferred Hu to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District. The police lawyer stated that the case still required the arrest of madam Bian Er and the recovery of the stolen goods, requesting an extension for the investigation. When questioned, the defendant Hu Shoutian confessed to successively submitting false accounts and embezzling public funds. After verifying the statements in court, the judge ordered a postponement of the trial to April 3rd. The defendant was remanded in custody.</p>
<h3>Opium Public Sales in Western Shanghai: Internal Strife Erupts; 50,000 Yuan in "Entertainment Expenses" End Up in the Pockets of the Handlers</h3>
<p>The public sale of opium in western Shanghai was very profitable for the "soil firms." Initially, there were only five firms, as an experiment. Seeing the business flourish, the number of firms continued to increase to as many as fifteen. According to reliable sources, the estimated total profit each month reached a huge sum of over 200,000 yuan. Recently, due to increased attention from the concession authorities, for safety, the owners of the "soil firms" decided to allocate 50,000 yuan each month from their surplus as "entertainment expenses." These funds were entrusted to Lan Jizhi, the owner of Yu Chang "soil firm" and the most active in promoting the public sale of opium in western Shanghai, and a man named Zheng Fuying for management and distribution. Unexpectedly, Lan and Zheng, driven by insatiable greed, pocketed most of the 50,000 yuan in "entertainment expenses," causing internal disputes within the Shanghai Western "Soil Firm" Association. However, according to those familiar with the details, the allocation of 50,000 yuan each month by each "soil firm" as "entertainment expenses" was indeed true. Ostensibly, the funds were managed and distributed by a Zhu Shunlin on behalf of Zheng and Lan, but in reality, the entire amount was embezzled by Zheng, Lan, and Zhu. Therefore, there have been intense undercurrents within the Shanghai Western "Soil Firm" Association recently.</p>
<h3>Another Accomplice Apprehended in the Plot to Kidnap Sheng Yupeng</h3>
<p>Sheng Zecheng (also known as Lao Si), a descendant of Sheng Xingsun, a former Qing Dynasty Grand Guardian of the Heir Apparent, lived at No. 75 Yuyuan Road. His nine-year-old son, Yupeng, attended the Western District School of the Municipal Council at No. 48 Avenue du Parc. At 3:15 PM on the 20th of this month, Chen Jin'du, the son of Chen Fu, an old servant of the Sheng family, suddenly conceived an evil plan. He hired accomplices and rented a car, driving to the school with the intention of luring Yupeng out and kidnapping him for ransom. The plot was thwarted when Detective Wu Chengmo of the Jing'an Temple Police Station arrested Chen Jin'du and his accomplice, Zhang Zhixiong, and sent them to the First Special District Court for trial and detention. Yesterday, the Chinese and foreign detectives in charge of this case apprehended another accomplice, Zhang Jinqing, a native of Jiangbei, at No. 12 Miaolong Lane on Jing'an Temple Road. He was taken to the police station and then sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case and requested permission to detain him for joint trial. After a brief interrogation by Judge Xiao, he ordered him to be remanded in custody pending a joint trial with Chen Jin'du on April 3rd.</p>
<h3>Divorce Suit Rejected</h3>
<p>Chen Shiru, a native of Shaoxing and an employee of the China National Products Company on Nanjing Road, residing at No. 300 Qipu Road, married a woman from the same hometown, Tong Qiaoxian. They had several children. In recent years, Tong became influenced by modern trends, and her clothing and lifestyle became extravagant. As a result, the 20 yuan monthly allowance Chen provided was insufficient for her expenses. She became dissatisfied with her husband and often ridiculed him, causing their love to deteriorate and leading to frequent arguments and fights. Recently, Tong hired lawyer Zhang Fukang to file a suit for separation of three years against her husband, Chen Shiru, in the District Court of the First Special District, requesting a court order for the defendant to continue paying a monthly allowance of 20 yuan during the separation period. However, Chen hired lawyer Yan Hongxiang to file a counterclaim against Tong Qiaoxian, requesting a court order for her to cohabitate with him. He argued that her sudden lawsuit was instigated by someone behind the scenes and requested that the original suit be rejected to prevent the couple from divorcing. Judge Peng summoned both parties for questioning and rendered a judgment yesterday. The main points of the judgment were that the plaintiff's suit was rejected and the plaintiff, Tong Qiaoxian, should cohabitate with the defendant, Chen Shiru. However, Tong had already moved elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Teenager Run Over and Killed by Tram</h3>
<p>At 3:45 AM yesterday, Tram No. 152 of the French Tramway Company, Route 18, traveling between the North Railway Station and the Xieqiao area, was driven by driver Tang Jingmei (No. 13). As it was traveling south in front of the Slaughterhouse Company on Avenue Doumer in the French Concession, Guan Zairong, a 16-year-old local resident of Huacheng Road, suddenly crossed the road westward from the pedestrian crossing at the entrance of the Xin Wanxiang Sauce Shop on Huacheng Road. Driver Tang inadvertently knocked Guan down, and the wheels ran over his lower body and legs, causing severe injuries to his hips, legs, and abdomen. He was immediately taken to Guangci Hospital but died before treatment could be administered.</p>

It is heard that the pharmacy's general manager, Yuan Yaoqing, and manager, Yuan Hesong, brothers, considering that the current business premises are too cramped, have decided to build a five-story mansion on the original site to meet their needs. They commissioned architect Xi Fuquan of Gongli Business Company for the design, and the construction is being undertaken by the United Construction Company. It has been over four months, and the project will be completed soon.</p>

<h3>Love is the Foundation of Marriage</h3>
<p>Deep love between couples makes a good family;</p>
<p>A husband's weakness casts a shadow on a sunny day!</p>
<p>The family is people's home and the foundation of society. The backbone of the family is the couple, which everyone knows. But what is the foundation of a couple? Probably not a few people are ignorant of this. Because in society, there are marriages bought and sold under the magic of money, as well as combinations of men and women dominated by feudal forces, relying solely on the words of matchmakers and the orders of parents, or even betrothals in the womb, and strange shapes such as red faces and white hair are not uncommon. In addition, ordinary stupid men and women, either blinded by vanity or confused by appearances, hastily consummate their good deeds, thus ruining their life's happiness, which is also very common. Men and women live together without love, which is called sleeping in the same bed with different dreams, and only wastes their youth. Isn't it very sad?</p>
<p>Then what is the foundation of a couple? Undoubtedly it is love. A loving couple, not only when they spend time together day and night, their hearts are connected, their pulses are connected, giving birth to clever children, organizing a happy family, how happy is their life! Even if they are separated, thousands of miles away, their love is still entangled, their dreams are intertwined, and they have a great sense of being unable to separate! Why is their love so deep? In our medical research, it is nothing more than the development of the unique physical characteristics of women, which have a strong aesthetic power to attract men; and the strength of men's energy, which can meet the needs of women. In addition, of course, aspects such as men and women's thoughts, morals, and personality are also related, but they are not the main thing. Because of this reason, women are particularly particular about beauty, and after marriage, men must pay special attention to maintaining their energy. If they can truly be healthy men and beautiful women, they will surely have a love as deep as the sea and be happier than flying. If a man has committed masturbation and nocturnal emission in his early years, or has been promiscuous after marriage, or has been injured by other worries, resulting in spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, neurasthenia, thin sperm and infertility, then the married life cannot be complete, and love will be shattered without a trace. If it is not treated quickly, it will lead to a tragedy of the couple turning against each other and the family! Regarding the method of treatment, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, the most effective treatment is to take the reproductive gland preparation "Reproductive Hormone", because this agent can produce sperm and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate blood, and nourish nerves within one day and night after taking it. If you can continue to take it, you will be able to completely cure the above-mentioned symptoms in a short period of time, and you can also achieve the effect of prolonging life and rejuvenating yourself. However, those with nocturnal emission must also take "Hymito's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gates and control this leakage, so the effect is even faster.</p>

<h3>The Misery of Shrunken Breasts!</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>Since the wave of women needing health and beauty has spread to various cities, I think all women who are ugly with shrunken breasts should be aware of it! Because a woman's lifelong happiness can be said to be completely controlled by a pair of breasts. If the breasts are shrunken and beauty is lost, then no matter how good her environment is, she cannot escape the slaughter of the devil. Let me give an example of a recent inquiry: "...To say my environment, there are many servants at home, I have a car to go in and out, I pay attention to clothing, and the enjoyment is excellent, which can be said to be the extreme of human wealth, but because I have been sick and in pain since I was a child, now I have irregular menstruation, leucorrhea, abdominal pain, and brain swelling, which makes my body uncomfortable every day. What I regret most is that due to the constant invasion of diseases, I have become haggard, my buttocks are thin, and my breasts are especially shrunken and pitiful. No matter how I dress up, when I go out, people see me, I don't know why, they always whisper about me. A quick-tongued relative even called me [old gun widow] behind my back. When I heard this title, I was really angry and dizzy, but what's the use of being dizzy? Alas!...I am twenty-five years old this year, but I don't have a partner yet, and my youth is wasted, can I not..." In the environment of Miss ×, her experience is like this, and the miserable fate of others whose environment is not as good as her can be imagined. However, in this day and age, science is omnipotent, and this kind of defect is also very easy to make up for. The main reason for shrunken breasts and aging is entirely due to the dysfunction of the ovaries, which affects metabolism. If you take the right medicine at this time, the ovarian preparation "Female Reproductive Hormone", it is not difficult to eliminate various gynecological diseases in a short period of time, make the body healthier day by day, and then the breasts will naturally be tall and the complexion will naturally be smooth. If you continue to take it, you can also prevent disease and prolong life and maintain youth.</p>
<h3>Spermatorrhea is Like Digging Your Own Grave</h3>
<p>— Sexually Transmitted Diseases Specialist Doctor Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Perhaps our shouts are too weak, but we have exhausted our voices. We are very uneasy seeing large numbers of young people running into the grave. This is indeed the misfortune of the times, but it is also our responsibility. We beat our chests and ask ourselves, feeling deeply guilty! However, young people of the times, you must also take care of yourselves. If you are not aware of it at all, then the efforts of others are in vain. Young people should be aware of the importance of their own responsibilities, especially in this great era, almost everything is waiting for you to rise up. But to shoulder this responsibility and prepare for the future struggle, you must have a strong physique and a smart brain. We know that there are not a few young people who are conscientious and hardworking to serve the country. But most are addicted to alcohol, or cause damage to their sexual function due to masturbation or early indulgence during the period of spring passion. Lack of sperm control, followed by nocturnal emission. Or, more frequently, nocturnal emission can cause spermatorrhea, kidney deficiency, incomplete development, neurasthenia and other symptoms. Then they are trapped in weakness and pain all day long. Not only can they not bear the heavy burden of the times, but they can not even perform the marital life of passing on the family, and they are hated by their wives, leading to all kinds of tragedies in the family. Therefore, if this disease is not removed, it is like being in a tomb. Although you are breathing, what is the meaning of being alive?</p>
<p>Regarding the effective treatment of nocturnal emission, according to world-renowned doctors and my experience, we all believe that we must purify the heart and reduce desires, abstain from masturbation, and take "Hymito's Sperm-Consolidating Tablets" to consolidate the sperm gates and calm the mind, and nocturnal emission can be cured. If the above-mentioned symptoms have been caused by nocturnal emission, you must also take the reproductive gland preparation "Reproductive Hormone" to nourish essence and blood, strengthen the brain and kidneys. If you can continue to take it, you will be able to recover soon, and you can also achieve the effect of prolonging life.</p>
<p>Leucorrhea Forum</p>

<p>Obligatory free diagnosis only costs 4 jiao</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Destroys Reproductive Tissues</h3>
<p>Gonorrhea is very fast in reproduction and very destructive, so people who suffer from gonorrhea are burdened by it for life. And the place where it destroys is always inseparable from the reproductive organ tissue. Like prostate inflammation, seminal vesiculitis, vasitis, orchitis, etc., all have the terrible possibility of destroying reproductive function. Therefore, infertility due to gonorrhea is 80-90%, which is something that every leucorrhea patient must pay attention to. It is advisable to carefully detect the symptoms and confirm that they belong to gonorrhea. Therefore, the medical equipment for diagnosis must be complete. Such as urethroscope, cystoscope, high-power microscope, slide glass, etc., are all indispensable. A clear diagnosis is like reconnaissance of the enemy's strength and location in war. With such information, you can win by surprise and capture the enemy. Treatment of Lin disease is also the same. First use scientific methods to diagnose the location of the disease, and then use scientific methods to completely cure it. Therefore, even stubborn and difficult to treat leucorrhea is not to be feared. All kinds of leucorrhea that can destroy reproduction can be treated with German Hershey's serum. Its bactericidal power penetrates deep into the tissues and can enhance the ability to resist gonorrhea. Its effectiveness is superior to all serums and pigment injections. It can replace all surgery. And on the one hand, use the latest invented filter-level electrotherapy by Dr. Genna, a German pharmacist, to insert the catheter into the urethra, so even strong gonococci will find it difficult to resist this type of projected electricity, so it can especially exert the bactericidal effect of Hershey's serum. It can also filter out the toxins produced by gonococci, so filter electrotherapy is the most advanced electrotherapy and is unparalleled in the world. It has been adopted by major venereal disease hospitals in the West. Various gonorrhea that destroy reproductive tissues can be cured in a short period of time and guaranteed to restore reproductive ability.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, according to the statement from the party concerned, Wenlan Joint Rental Agency, in the news column of your newspaper, there was a report of a rental dispute between the landlord and tenants of Wenlan Fang on Route Cardinal Foch in the French Concession, which is inconsistent with the facts. We request a correction. After checking, before the transfer of property rights of the Wenlan Fang houses, each building originally rented for seventy yuan. After the property rights were transferred to our agency in November of the 26th year, the rent was only thirty-five to forty-two yuan. At the same time, all tenants were notified to come to sign contracts. The house tickets and contracts all clearly stated that water and electricity costs were to be borne by the tenants themselves. At that time, the water and electricity company did not have this type of water meter, so it was delayed until February of this year that the installation was completed. However, a small number of tenants have been making trouble, refusing to pay rent, speaking disrespectfully to collectors, and ignoring repeated demands for contract signing. Their intentions are self-evident. Furthermore, the Wenlan Fang managed by our agency consists of a total of thirty-three buildings, while your newspaper reported more than twenty, which is also inaccurate. Therefore, we specially request your great lawyer to send a letter requesting a correction, and hope you will handle it accordingly. Sincerely, To the News Editors of Shen Bao, Lawyer Lu Shidao, March 27th.</p>

<h3>Encouraging the New Pharmaceutical Industry and Addressing the Physicians' Association</h3>
<p>— Liu Yixiang</p>
<p>I have always loved using domestically produced new drugs. Initially, I was worried about the impurity of the quality and felt uneasy when using them. However, after careful inspection and selection, the results were satisfactory, which I found comforting. However, recently, the number of pharmaceutical factories has increased, and the types of new drugs have also increased. When Factory A releases a new drug, Factories B and C are sure to follow suit, even resorting to cutting corners and reducing materials to compete with each other, which greatly disappoints users. Looking at the rubber industry before January 28th, because a certain factory made a significant profit, everyone rushed to catch up, manufacturing crudely and recklessly, and selling at low prices. As a result, no profit was made, or they went bankrupt or closed down, resulting in a lose-lose situation. This is what is called a suicidal policy. The path taken by the new pharmaceutical industry is quite similar to this. With the lessons of the past, I cannot help but feel concerned. Pharmaceutical factories in Europe and the United States all produce products of uniform quality and constantly improve them. However, pharmaceutical factories in our country only greedily seek immediate small profits, reducing the quality when sales are good. I hope that the new pharmaceutical industry will have a long-term vision, taking revitalizing national products as its responsibility, striving for excellence, and not lowering quality due to competition. For example, the competition for yeast preparations is the most intense. Although the price has decreased, the quality is far from what it used to be. What the medical community hopes for are excellent products that can replace foreign goods, not cheaply made products. Each factory should have a spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation and should not compete by reducing quality. Minor quality differences are fine for two or three nutritional supplements, but if all medical injectable drugs are handled in this way, the future of the new pharmaceutical industry will be very bleak. As a result, those who love national products will have to turn to high-priced foreign goods. The Swiss Ciba Pharmaceutical Factory and Roche Pharmaceutical Factory do not produce many products, but each one is of excellent quality. I believe that the new pharmaceutical industry in our country should take them as a model, not producing crudely and recklessly. It is most fortunate.</p>
<p>Finally, I have a suggestion for the Physicians' Association. The Physicians' Association, occupying a leading position, should unite with the health bureaus of the two concessions to register new drugs. Those that meet the standards should be issued certificates, and those that are found to be of poor quality or do not meet the standards after registration should be punished. In this way, unscrupulous operators will be deterred, and legitimate operators will be protected. Doctors can use qualified drugs with peace of mind, achieving multiple benefits in one fell swoop. I hope that the officials of the authorities will work hard to achieve this.</p>
<h3>Regarding Public Bathhouses</h3>
<p>— Jiang Shao Song</p>
<p>Bathing is the first step in cleanliness and hygiene, which everyone knows and does not need explanation. However, aside from schools with perfect facilities, and noble organizations and institutions with their own bathrooms, people in the metropolis can also go to hotels that have rooms with bathrooms to bathe. The bathing problem for other people can only be completely entrusted to public bathhouses - commonly known as "mixed baths". This is a place exclusively for men to bathe. Women can only wait for the arrival of the God of Summer to make things easier. The heavy cost of running into a public bathhouse, the common use of bath towels, and the dirtiness of the large pool - these fundamental improvement problems of the bathhouse will not be discussed at the moment. Let us first discuss two problems. These two problems are the special scenery of the public bathhouse, namely "back scrubbing" and "foot massage". I must state that I am not criticizing the value of the profession, but rather contributing some opinions from a hygienic point of view for the reference of bathers. Every public</p>
<p>The Problem of Back Scrubbing</p>
<p>Every public bathhouse is prepared with a large batch of naked back scrubbing staff for the bathers to use. If the bathers do not want back scrubbing, they are very unwelcome, and the service in the bathhouse seems very indifferent. So most of the bathers who step into the public bathhouse receive back scrubbing. Some fat old patrons even specify one or two experts to give a heavy full-body massage. Light scrubbing is not satisfying. Some old bathers bathe every day and scrub every day. Without bathing and scrubbing, they feel itchy and unbearable. Some even use boiling hot bath water, scrubbing as they pour the water on themselves. These are habits formed along with the public bathhouse. From a medical and hygienic point of view, there are quite a few flaws. Why? During back scrubbing, the skin temporarily becomes congested. In other words, most of the blood in the body rushes to the skin. Therefore, staying in the bathroom for too long easily causes fainting, such as acute cerebral anemia and other acute diseases. The face turns pale, and the person becomes unconscious, causing panic and confusion. This kind of news is often heard. Skin congestion causes internal organ anemia because the amount of blood in the human body is limited and will not increase due to bathing. If you follow the saying "do not get a haircut on an empty stomach, and do not bathe on a full stomach," it is even more unreasonable because internal organ anemia also leads to digestive organ anemia. Digestive power will definitely decrease, so going to bathe and scrub after a full meal is very likely to cause digestive disorders and is very inappropriate. If you bathe and scrub every day, spending a long time in the bathroom, the chance of catching a cold increases in the winter. Daily washing and scrubbing with boiling hot bath water often anesthetizes the superficial nerves of the skin, and the skin's nutrition will deteriorate, and its resistance will decrease. The skin becomes loose and easily infected with skin diseases or eczema. It is easy for us to see that many people who often bathe and scrub suffer from skin diseases, probably due to the habit of scrubbing. There must be some causal relationship. There is also one thing that needs to be added as a warning. Many people who initially suffer from scabies always run to the bathhouse to scrub their backs. Although scrubbing can temporarily relieve itching, the skin becomes congested and its resistance weakens. Boiling hot bath water cannot kill the mites, but the spread of scabies becomes faster and more extensive the next day. This is a definite course. I am not saying that people with scabies should not bathe. Bathing is indeed excellent, but do not scrub your back because the disadvantages outweigh the advantages.</p>
<p>The Problem of Foot Massage</p>
<p>Many people leave school life and enter society to work. After going to public bathhouses to bathe, they gradually develop the habit of foot massage. The person being massaged feels both pain and itch, with an indescribable feeling of pleasure. Initially, there is a situation of half-acceptance and half-rejection, both happy and afraid. After deciding and trying it a few times, it becomes like a smoking addiction, impossible to stop. Some with long-term addiction even choose skilled masseuses for heavy massage, not stopping until the skin breaks and water flows out. However, the foot massage cloths used in the bathhouse are always the same ones. Many of those old bathers and old friends who massage feet often suffer from chronic eczema or athlete's foot (Hong Kong foot). While massaging left and right, again and again, all the bathers become infected with foot dampness or athlete's foot. The author has several close friends who have personally experienced this situation. Some even had large areas of skin broken by the foot massage, resulting in prolonged pus and blood that took a long time to heal. Several people decided to never massage their feet again. As a result, their old foot dampness and athlete's foot completely healed. These are all very true facts. There is also an unrealistic saying circulating in society that if foot dampness is cured, the damp heat will attack internally and turn into internal diseases. Do not believe this. Foot dampness is indeed difficult to treat in people who continue to massage their feet. The popular saying that it turns into internal diseases after being cured may be a way for doctors to shirk responsibility. When internal diseases subside, various skin eczema and so on on the body can indeed be alleviated somewhat. This is because during internal diseases, the skin is malnourished, and the bacteria parasitic in the skin layer wither and die, and skin secretions are also greatly reduced. Therefore, the habit of foot massage can be said to be entirely without merit. The feet are originally prone to eczema. We cannot guarantee that people who do not massage their feet will never suffer from eczema, but foot massage is indeed the best way to push the boat along and help spread the infection. Regardless of the bathhouse managers being annoyed and unable to please the bathers, I urge all bathers to make up their minds and quickly quit the habit of foot massage. This habit is harmful and useless.</p>

<h3>The Scientification of Traditional Chinese Medicine (Continued from Issue 6)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>(Antipyretics II) Scutellaria baicalinsis, Georg.</p>
<p>Morphology</p>
<p>This product is collected from the roots of Scutellaria baicalinsis and dried between November and February of the following year. The plant is a perennial herb of the Lamiaceae family, produced in the northern provinces of our country. The underground roots are deep yellow and hard. The stems are about one meter tall, the leaves are opposite, without stalks, lanceolate, with sharp ends. Spiked inflorescences emerge from the leaf axils, with pale purple labiate flowers blooming in summer, after which small spherical achenes are formed.</p>
<p>Taste and Contraindications</p>
<p>The taste is slightly bitter, so its nature is bitter and neutral. It is contraindicated with cinnabar, peony bark, and Veratrum nigrum.</p>
<p>Quality</p>
<p>Dark brown and solid is the best quality, called Tiao Ling. Old roots and those that are hollow in the middle are inferior, called Ku Ling. Currently, those produced in Shanxi and Rehe are considered the best. Those produced in Korea and Japan are of lower quality.</p>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<p>Contains yellow needle-shaped or plate-shaped crystals of Scutellarin. According to recent reports, its roots contain two derivatives: Woogonin C16 H12 05 and Baicalin C21 H18 O11.</p>
<p>Effect</p>
<p>It is an antipyretic and tonic drug, effective in treating influenza, tetanus, vomiting, and diarrhea. Daily dose: 3 to 10 grams, used as a decoction. The ancient prescription Huang Qin Tang is made with Scutellaria baicalinsis 9 grams, jujube 9 grams, licorice 6 grams, peony 6 grams, and water 600 grams, decocted to 200 grams, and taken in three divided doses daily, suitable for feverish diarrhea, large intestine catarrh, and bacillary dysentery.</p>
<p>Old Saying</p>
<p>Ling, said Wen, is written as Quan, referring to its yellow color. Ling also means Qian, which is a yellow-black color, hence the name Huang Ling. Chen Xiuyuan commented on Huang Ling: "Huang Qin, Huang Lian, and Huang Bo all have a bitter taste and yellow color, and their main treatments are roughly similar. Generally speaking, stagnation can treat heat, bitterness can dry dampness, and yellow belongs to earth. Yellow and bright belongs to metal. Metal borrows the color of earth to become its color, so gold is the most valuable of the five metals." In ancient times, there was no scientific theory to discuss medicine. It was so difficult. Why do those who talk about medicine today still like to follow the ancients? Are they lacking scientific knowledge, or are they intentionally respecting the old?</p>
<h3>Talking about Rheumatic Pain</h3>
<p>— Wang Yu Gang</p>
<p>The name rheumatic pain is a common term in the old customs. What is its meaning? From the name, it indicates due to wind and dampness. However, the two factors of wind and dampness are mostly inducing factors. Its pathogens are probably elsewhere. According to the symptoms of this disease, when looking for it in the categories of new medicine, I feel that it is most similar to the disease Rheumatismus, so I have translated it as rheumatic pain. However, what new medicine calls neuralgia can also be considered rheumatic pain by the old customs. Syphilitic myositis, arthritis, periostitis, etc. can also be mistaken for rheumatic pain. Conversely, true rheumatic pain can also be mistaken for syphilis. This kind of mistake is also due to the old customs not recognizing the value of diagnostics. The pathogens of rheumatic pain, after many efforts by many researchers, have indeed not been discovered to this day. However, most people explore from the aspect of infectious diseases. The scientific journey is originally an arduous task. There are many patients with rheumatic pain. There are more people in the South of our country than in the North. This is probably because the humidity in the air in the South is higher. The body parts it invades are divided into muscles and joints. Its symptoms are divided into acute and chronic. The acute symptoms of muscle rheumatic pain are pain and swelling of the larger muscles, such as the trapezius muscle in the back, the sternocleidomastoid muscle in the neck, the deltoid muscle in the shoulder, the pectoral muscle, the intercostal muscle, the lumbar muscle, etc., either invading one muscle or invading several muscles at the same time. The pain is severe, and high fever often occurs. If there is no heart disease, the prognosis is generally good. Chronic patients have no fever, the pain is also mild, with a sour nature, occurring and stopping from time to time, and it is not easy to completely cure. The acute symptoms of joint rheumatic pain are the same as the former, but the invasion is in the joints, either one or several, often accompanied by the danger of endocarditis or pleurisy. Chronic patients are mostly limited to one joint, occurring and stopping from time to time, hindering movement. The treatment of this disease, although acute is dangerous, is easy to be effective. The method must be a combination of internal medicine, external application, and injection. In internal medicine, of course, salicylic acid is the main component, supplemented by cardiac stimulants. If the fever is too high, antipyretics are added. External medicine focuses on relieving pain and reducing inflammation, such as cold compresses, applying ichthammol, scopolamine ointment, etc. Among the injectable drugs, intravenous injection of Atophanyl has the fastest effect, but attention must be paid to whether the patient's heart is healthy. For chronic patients, internal medicine is salicylic acid and iodide, and external application is hot water baths and warm poultices, or artificial sun lamps, but the effect is slow. As for the injectable drugs, the current understanding is that Fangji preparations are effective. I have used them repeatedly but have not been satisfied. In short, the pathogens of this disease have not yet been discovered, so it is reasonable that the treatment is difficult to be effective.</p>
<p>Food and Nutrition Knowledge</p>
<h3>Scientific Research on Food and Nutrition</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zhenyu</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>When hungry, seek food; when thirsty, seek drink. Therefore, eating and drinking are the basis of life. Only knowing how to seek food and drink without knowing the effects of eating and drinking will gradually damage health in the small way and can cause disease in the large way. How can the way of food and nutrition be neglected?</p>
<p>Checking our country's medical books, there are also the Food Scripture of the King of Huainan, the Food Therapy Materia Medica of Meng Shen, and the Ancient and Modern Food Treatment of Sun Simiao. The ancients' emphasis on the way of food and nutrition can be seen in these. However, in the 20th century, science has progressed with each passing day, and there have also been new developments in the knowledge of food and nutrition. Therefore, the author takes the knowledge of food and nutrition as the warp and the results of scientific research as the weft, willing to ask the gentlemen of the world for their quality.</p>
<p>(1) The Importance of Food and Nutrition</p>
<p>The success of one's career is based on having a healthy body. With a sound body, one can have a sound spirit. With a sound spirit, one's career will be successful in everything. To maintain a healthy body, appropriate food and nutrition are essential.</p>
<p>The new knowledge of food and nutrition is indeed the main discovery of modern science. The remarkable characteristics of this knowledge are that it is accessible to common sense and can be implemented by everyone. If you follow its path, the happiness and joy of a lifetime will be endless. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Supporting the "Anti-Spitting Campaign"</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>It seems that some people say that at a time when the whole country is busy resisting the war, some things that are not directly related to the war can be reduced, and the strength to do these things can be transferred to special use for the war. Therefore, the "Anti-Spitting Campaign" is regarded by some people as one of these things, thinking that the Shanghai Women's Association, which initiated this campaign, can put this matter aside and do something more urgently needed.</p>
<p>This statement is certainly correct. However, I think that there is nothing wrong with launching this campaign at this time. Resistance to the war is the top priority, that's right; but it is only the top priority, it does not mean that in addition to resistance to the war, nothing else, especially public welfare matters, should be done. Therefore, as long as any organization launches any legitimate campaign, under the condition of not forgetting resistance to the war as the top priority, dividing labor and cooperating, or doing what they can with the remaining strength, who can say that it is not right? Moreover, this campaign is indeed closely related to the health of the nation, and we should pay attention to it at any time and any place. Only a healthy nation can undertake the progress of world civilization; and only a healthy nation can better achieve the success of resisting foreign insults. If we want to be healthy, we have no choice but to resist spitting!</p>
<p>It seems that some people also say that launching this campaign in Shanghai is somewhat like doing it for the Europeans and Americans to see, in order to maintain our dignity. If this is really the case, it is considered unnecessary to make this extra effort. I also think that this statement has considerable reason, because we have our own habits, such as they shake hands when they meet, and we clasp hands, why must we accommodate them and learn their ways to get a compliment from them? However, what is spitting, this bad habit, all about? I think that not spitting, at least not spitting randomly, is something that every modern person should be able to do, regardless of whether Europeans and Americans see it or not! Just as Europeans and Americans like competitive sports, we should also promote competitive sports, and we cannot say that we are learning the fashion.</p>
<p>In addition, I think that launching this campaign in Shanghai or any large city is more urgent than in small cities or villages in the inland. Because in places with many people, tubercle bacilli can be even more rampant. I hope that as far as our current situation is concerned, now that this campaign has been launched in Shanghai, the residents of our Shanghai will all rise up to support and implement it.</p>
<p>To be honest, in every place we go, the sound of coughing and spitting is endless, and with every step we take, phlegm and spittle are constantly in our sight. What kind of phenomenon is this after all! As an individual, I truly hate and detest it! Why should we let it go and not eradicate it completely!</p>
<h3>Morning Exercise</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>——A Fragment of a Strong Man's Life</p>
<p>The dawn sliced through the darkness of the night. The wilderness gradually changed its colors; the leaves and wild grass all exuded the gentle breath of the morning; the rolling clouds, as they rose with the morning sun, competed in a display of beautiful and magnificent colors—some golden yellow, some cyan and purple, some milky white.</p>
<p>The bugle call, carried by the morning breeze, spread out, even more solemn and clear in the silent sky! Every strong man was stirred with burgeoning ambition.</p>
<p>We braved the misty morning air, ran into the drill ground, and rushed towards the fluttering flag of our company. As a group, we ran, our feet making a "stab-sh, stab-sh" sound. The cinder road stirred up black dust, spreading and covering the nearby grass with a layer of black powder.</p>
<p>"Whistle-whistle—whistle—" suddenly another whistle blast signaled assembly.</p>
<p>Standing under the company flag, we formed a long line: attention, alignment…following the instructor's strong voice, we began to move. Circular movements, once, twice, three times…then, more fiercely, more tensely, running, sprinting, lying down, charging; then breaking down into smaller units, and reassembling.</p>
<p>After these exercises, we began to divide into two opposing groups, practicing positional warfare, setting up guerrilla networks, disrupting the enemy's rear, and assisting the regular army in counterattacks. The use of intelligence and strength seemed like a real battle situation!</p>
<p>Although we were all sweating, our heads like steaming baskets, hot air rising, sweat dripping from our heads to our cheeks, soaking our collars, no one noticed.</p>
<p>During the break, the instructor relaxed his sternness and said to us very kindly:</p>
<p>"Among you, there are quite a few pampered young masters, but your discipline and performance are almost equal to that of a regular army; however, we cannot be complacent, because we are the reserve force for the current stage of the War of Resistance, and we have the responsibility to revitalize the nation and create a new China! Be more courageous, more determined, and strive towards the goal of national liberation!…"</p>
<p>When he finished speaking, a kind smile appeared on his face: then, he ordered us to sing and dismissed the company.</p>
<p>The excited group became even more excited; raising our strong voices, we sang loudly: "For the freedom of national survival, we will not hesitate to use our hot blood, we will not hesitate to use our skulls, to fight against the invaders!…"</p>
<p>At this time, the company, with songs, solemnly walked out of the drill ground, each person seeing clearly the beautiful wilderness bathed in the morning sun; on our hearts, the desire to expel the enemy was further strengthened.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on Reading Books and Newspapers (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Tu Lao</p>
<p>A certain newspaper reported: a certain artist went to a certain place to "serve." But it is unknown what "service" he "serves"? Judging from the circumstances, it is probably nothing more than painting and calligraphy.</p>
<p>However, I thought of Zhao Mengfu.</p>
<p>It is said that when Zhao Mengfu painted horses, he first had to lie on the ground and make a horse posture himself, and then start writing. Although this legend ostensibly compliments Zhao Mengfu's realistic skills, in reality, I think it is secretly scolding Zhao Mengfu. If I were to interpret Zhao Mengfu's horse paintings, it would precisely be the material given by the reality of the northern foreign (Jin and Yuan) invasion of China at that time. The horses of the border were the best tools for war at that time, and Chinese historians had long been grateful for them. Whether Zhao Mengfu's horse paintings were due to admiration, awe, or surprise is now impossible to investigate. But after he "loyally protected the Yuan Dynasty," it is entirely possible that he would paint several "portraits" of the horses raised by the "Yuan" generals. At this time, the artist had become a flatterer. So I think that legend is actually a satire.</p>
<p>But now it is a bit difficult for artists to flatter invaders. Cars, tanks, and airplanes can naturally be painted, but even if they are exactly alike, they have no vitality. Only painting cannons is more interesting, but they must be painted as cannons that are currently shelling people. However, painters cannot bring their pens to the battlefield to paint. Learning from Zhao Mengfu, let a cannon shell you first, but you will inevitably lose your life. -- This is really impossible to think of.</p>
<p>However, I suddenly remembered the fate of the painter depicted in Ryunosuke Akutagawa's novel "Hell Screen"... Ah, let's not continue.</p>
<p>I like to read advertisements, but only to understand some new social tricks. Current advertisements are really much more exciting than before.</p>
<p>"To cope with the national crisis, you need a lively body." is an advertisement for a dance hall. "To make it easier for guests to care for refugees, the price of dishes has been greatly sacrificed." is an advertisement for a restaurant. "To fight the war of resistance, the first thing you need is a strong body, and wine can generate blood and nourish the mind." is an advertisement for a hotel...</p>
<p>However, the most brilliant is: "In times of national crisis, you must seek health", and to be "healthy" you must take medicine, and the effect of taking medicine is to "definitely satisfy your wife".</p>
<p>We have been advocating "humor" for several years, and now we really have "humor". But unfortunately, the "humorists" are not paying attention.</p>
<p>However, what best shows the prosperity of the isolated island is that "forbidden books" are being reprinted everywhere", as if we are now living under the rule of a revolutionary government. But looking at the titles, the "forbidden books" are indeed "forbidden books", but they are all "forbidden" because the books are really obscene. Now our eyes are really blessed, and we can see so many good treasures. If this continues, I think "The Carnal Prayer Mat" and "Apricot Flower Heaven" and other "forbidden books" will soon be reprinted solemnly, Amen!</p>
<h3>"Spring"</h3>
<p>— Liu Lan</p>
<p>Some people love the season when yellow leaves flutter and fallen flowers cover the ground. They wander in ancient paths in the setting sun of autumn, accompanied by their lonely shadows; or sit in the courtyard, gazing at yellow leaves, idly counting fallen flowers, but people say: "This is too old and late in life, young people should not abandon the world like this." However, it is said that the poet's wise eyes can still see "life" in autumn.</p>
<p>Some people also love the cold and severe winter, a vast expanse of white snow, a crystal world. It is said that this is also the temperament of a poet, and even more the character of a warrior. My thoughts then galloped in the wilderness, the open fields, and the icy and snowy lands. What is the state of mind of the fighters doing great work? Cursing or appreciating? Let the facts fill in the answer!</p>
<p>But I, an ordinary and mediocre person, long for spring, a vibrant and energetic season!</p>
<p>A voice rang in my ears: "Spring is here!" I don't know who whispered to me. The tone was so gentle and harmonious. Like adding fuel to the flame, it will become a moving love song. But I said faintly: "There is no spring here." Perhaps angered by this indifferent attitude, there was no reply, and the footsteps of the visitor gradually disappeared into the distance.</p>
<p>I opened the window and looked up. The sky was gray and gloomy, filled with dark clouds. A gust of wind blew from the distant sky. Could it be bringing the message of spring? I wondered. A pungent smell of blood rushed towards me, not the breath of spring. "There is no spring here," I muttered the sentence again. I closed the window tightly.</p>
<p>Driving a light boat of recollection, I swayed on the sea of memory: throughout the winter, I recited Shelley's famous line: "If winter comes, can spring be far behind?" Yes, spring will come soon. But now, winter is gone, and there is still no spring here.</p>
<p>"Miscellaneous flowers grow on trees, and warblers fly in confusion." A scene of warmth and harmony, a charming scenery, is really easy to make people yearn for. But the fields of Jiangnan, no, the entire earth, are no longer tranquil and solemn. Demons have brought great turmoil. The plains are dotted with desolation: broken walls and dilapidated houses, bloody corpses, violated girls, and suffering children. Friends, is this a symbol of spring?</p>
<p>I tell you: "There is no spring here!"</p>
<p>But ah, I also want to tell you: "Spring will come." After the cultivation of sweat and the irrigation of blood, the earth will return to spring, and the intoxicating spring breeze will ripple in the fields.</p>
<p>But, in the end, I want to ask you: "How will you sweat and bleed for the earth—our mother?"</p>
<p>"Hey, you say, you say!"</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>"Today you are the father-in-law, I have nothing to offer, so I respect you with this cup, please don't refuse."</p>
<p>Town Chief Chen declined for a while, and seeing that he couldn't refuse, he raised the cup in front of him and said, "As you wish! As you wish! I'll drink it."</p>
<p>"No! You must drink this cup in front of me, that's the proper etiquette." One-eyed Li snatched Town Chief Chen's wine glass and replaced it with his own cup.</p>
<p>Town Chief Chen knew that One-eyed Li had seen through his plan, and refusing to drink would be self-defeating. He hardened his heart and laughed loudly.</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! Do you suspect that I would poison you on this happy day? Since you don't believe me, I'll drink it to show you."</p>
<p>After saying that, he raised his neck and drank the poisoned wine in one gulp, then poured a glass of poisoned wine for One-eyed Li and earnestly urged everyone to toast. One-eyed Li saw that Town Chief Chen had finished the wine and no longer suspected him. The X army officer and the Pacification Squad leader certainly did not suspect anything either. At the same time, Town Chief Chen earnestly and bitterly persuaded them, and they couldn't refuse, so they unknowingly drank the wine in the cup.</p>
<p>With the wine in their stomachs, the talk and laughter became uninhibited. The X army officer and One-eyed Li kept teasing the Pacification Squad leader, who was so happy that he grinned and just laughed. One-eyed Li said to Town Chief Chen again:</p>
<p>"Your Miss Xiuyue and the Pacification Squad leader are really a match made in heaven."</p>
<p>Town Chief Chen was already suffering from abdominal pain, but he still forced a smile and said:</p>
<p>"Don't say that! I'm just afraid that my little girl is incompetent and not worthy to serve him!"</p>
<p>"This is East Asia Co... co..." The Pacification Squad leader couldn't finish the "co", he held his stomach with both hands and said, "Why does my stomach suddenly hurt!"</p>
<p>After he said that, the X army officer and One-eyed Li also felt abdominal pain, very uncomfortable, and couldn't help but glare at Town Chief Chen and asked:</p>
<p>"What's going on?"</p>
<p>Town Chief Chen couldn't bear the pain any longer. He left his seat, jumping and leaping, while still laughing loudly.</p>
<p>"Ha! Ha! Ha! What a celebration meeting, it's clearly a death meeting. You're taking the road to hell when there's a path to heaven..."</p>
<p>The X army officer was furious, pulled out his pistol, aimed it at Town Chief Chen's head, and fired a shot. With the firing of this shot, he himself, the Pacification Squad leader, and One-eyed Li all fell to the ground bleeding from all seven orifices.</p>
<p>This shocking live drama startled the X puppet troops who were indulging in pleasure and drinking, and they all gathered around to see what was happening. At this moment, suddenly, with a "boom" of a signal cannon, Commander Ye's troops had launched a counterattack from the east, west, and north roads into Hepu Town. (44)</p>

<h3>Japan in Wartime</h3>
<p>— Gong Huai</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army lit the fire of aggression on the Lugou Bridge, twenty-one months have passed. When the war first started, the Japanese soldiers were full of hope that they could "win a quick victory" and seize "a large amount of benefit" with "a small amount of force." They thought that adding planned political conspiracies to new weapons such as airplanes, cannons, and warships would easily make our country "kneel". But under the strong resistance of our army, "quick war and quick decision" has become a daydream, which was of course beyond the expectations of those who advocated militarism.</p>
<p>So, what is Japan like in wartime? Please see the following news, although they are all "trivial" social trends that seem "unimportant", but using the "small" to represent the "big", it is not difficult to imagine the results that the invaders deserve from here.</p>
<p>Professor Famine</p>
<p>According to news from the Japanese Ministry of Education, recently, in universities across the country, a large number of professors and assistant professors have been arrested or suspended for participating in People's Front groups or being reported for having anti-war thoughts. As a result, all universities deeply feel the professor famine, making it difficult for Minister of Education Araki to cope. Currently, six universities, including Tokyo Imperial University, have a total shortage of 169 professors and 162 assistant professors, which is truly an unprecedented phenomenon in the Japanese education sector.</p>
<p>Unable to Marry</p>
<p>Japanese women have not yet broken away from the constraints of feudal society. "Good wife and wise mother" is their highest moral standard. Most women take "marriage" as a shortcut to solve their lives, but recently, due to the protracted war against China, young men have been sent to the front lines in China in large numbers, and the number of casualties is so high. Invisibly, it has taken away the husbands of many Japanese girls, making it impossible for girls of marriageable age to find a marriage partner. According to a recent survey by the Tokyo Municipal Social Bureau, there are 200,000 in Tokyo alone. These young girls, unable to marry, have to wander the streets in search of jobs, but where are there so many ready-made positions to place these marriageable girls?</p>
<p>Horse-drawn Carriages Reappear</p>
<p>Gasoline is an important fuel in wartime, and Japan, which is poor, naturally regards it as a treasure and is unwilling to waste any more of it. Therefore, cars have become very rare in Tokyo recently, and most of them use charcoal as a substitute. Horse-drawn carriages, which have disappeared from Tokyo for decades, have reappeared to replace cars and freight trucks, as if returning to the early Meiji era. If the war does not stop, horse-drawn carriages will inevitably flood Japan.</p>
<p>Dismissal of Leaders</p>
<p>The result of the shortage of textiles will bring about a change in Japanese clothing. Soon, the new clothes of Japanese women must be shortened uniformly, which is a government order. In the future, Japanese girls will wear fashionable clothes without "collars" and "sleeves", and their underwear will be shortened to an alarming extent. Such a "chic" dress will be a special decoration in Tokyo at that time.</p>
<p>Fewer Babies</p>
<p>In a meeting of the Japanese House of Representatives, Ito Iwao, a member of the Seiyukai, asked Minister of Health Hirose about the decline in Japan's birth rate, expressing anxiety and asking the government to explain its countermeasures. According to Hirose's reply, the birth rate has indeed "significantly" decreased in this war of aggression. "The usual production of nearly two million per year is probably reduced by three to four hundred thousand." This is still the so-called official report, and the actual number should not be limited to this. Moreover, because people's lives are difficult, the mortality rate of infants and young children is also higher than usual, which is a serious social problem.</p>
<p>"The happy, cherry-blossom-like Japan has disappeared, and a shadow of sorrow covers every inch of land, and tears of sadness drip on everyone's heart"! These words of Sano Seki accurately describe the situation.</p>
<h3>Safety Movement</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>The continuous vehicle accidents caused by carelessness are currently the most serious problem in the United States. In order to reduce their number, I have appointed Secretary Robert and Senator Moore to jointly form a committee to conduct research on protecting national life and property.</p>
<p>Fortunately, due to the widespread dissemination of the various terrors caused by reckless driving through writing and other methods, countless drivers are now well aware of this fact; I have high hopes for them, because the solution to this serious problem must rely on the strength of all drivers.</p>
<p>May our lives be safer from now on. If only each of us, each family, is careful and mindful when walking or driving, and not reckless, then thousands upon thousands of people will certainly not die in vain under the wheels.</p>
<p>U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, on the first day of 1938, in view of the increasing number of vehicle accidents, specially issued the above remarks; his intention, of course, was to promote the attention and caution of every citizen, and to use collective strength to reduce the number of these unfortunate deaths. At that time, an article entitled "- And Sudden Death" was also published in a magazine called "Reader's Digest." The article analyzed the various causes of the serious problem of "vehicle accidents" in great detail and thoroughly. As expected, the attention of the entire American public was focused on "vehicle accidents." Needless to say, as proven by past facts, this safety movement in the United States was successful.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Baker, the head of the Transportation Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, seeing the sudden increase in traffic accidents in Shanghai last year (it is reported that the death toll totaled 8,729 people, breaking all previous records), also wants to launch a safety movement, named "Safety Week"; its purpose and intention are exactly the same as the one conducted by President Roosevelt mentioned above, which can be said to be a coincidence. Whether viewed from the perspective of the life of every Shanghai citizen or from the perspective of the welfare of the entire society, this safety movement is indeed worthy of our advocacy and vigorous promotion. Why should we die in vain under the wheels due to the carelessness of others, and why should we accidentally crush a beloved compatriot who has no grievances or enmity?</p>
<p>In fact, the problem now is not that we do not know what to do about "vehicle accidents", but whether we can concentrate our minds and spirits to do everything we know about methods and precautions. The National Safety Council of the United States says: "If each of us applies everything we know to prevent vehicle accidents, then the number of these accidental deaths can be reduced by 50 percent." Therefore, every citizen of Shanghai, if you want your life to be safe, you must work hard to do everything that can prevent vehicle accidents, that is, you must do your best to support and promote this safety movement.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of education, we must also do our best to promote the importance of "caution", the terror of being crushed to death, and various "safety" concepts. Then, the effectiveness of the safety movement will also increase greatly, without a doubt. In addition, such as organizing "safety patrol teams", strictly enforcing traffic regulations, strictly holding examinations for vehicle drivers, improving traffic lights, and adding street lights...etc., are also worthy of our attention. In short, by holding this safety movement with the strength of all citizens, we will definitely ensure that our lives are "safe".</p>
<h3>Thoughts on "Fallen Rouge"</h3>
<p>— Si Jing</p>
<p>"Fallen Rouge" is a very familiar story, and this story may be happening around us: a pampered young lady, because of the sudden change in her family, is forced onto a path of inevitable depravity, and finally, like a bubble rising from a pond, quietly ends her life, as if she had never come into this world. Can you deny that this is not a story happening around us? But when these poor lives leave this world, let's take a look at the people standing around her (including the executioners who killed her). Some sigh, some make terrifying cold laughter, and what about the executioners who killed her? He left without looking back. Then, other people left as if they had finished watching some excitement. They followed the people who left first to watch the second "excitement" happen, and so on countless times. After watching "Fallen Rouge", I had the same feeling as above. It only conceptually tells the audience such a story, but does not point out the dark side that created such a story, letting people see things they have never seen before, so that those who sigh feel their own weakness: those who laugh coldly feel their own cruelty, and are angry: as for those executioners, at least they can never be seen again.</p>
<p>Therefore, the biggest shortcoming of "Fallen Rouge" is its lack of proactiveness. First: Like the character Zhao Zhenni, she undoubtedly represents progressive women, but after seeing her once at school, she did not appear again until Lu Ming became a dancer, and this only appearance was so fragile!</p>
<p>Second: It is not enough to use a letter to show Jia Nong's destruction of the Huasha market. From the time he participated in Lu Ming's birthday party, we were more aware that he was a pseudo-gentleman who had ulterior motives for Lu Ming.</p>
<p>Really, if on the one hand, the progressive woman Zhao Zhenni can be emphasized, and the fall of Lu Ming can be contrasted on the other hand, and on the one hand, the oppression of national capital by foreign capital can be written more clearly, then this script will definitely be very meaningful.</p>
<h3>Huang Hua Gang (Ballad Singing)</h3>
<p>— Yi Bai</p>
<p>There are two types of ballad singing: one is long-form, called "Manzi Huo," and the other is short-form, called "Duan'er Shu," also known as "Chang Pian." What is sung in today's "Luozi Guan" (entertainment venues) are all "Chang Pian," which are excerpts from long-form pieces. For example, "Dream of the Red Chamber" originally had thirteen sections, "Qianjin Quande" originally had eight sections, and "Fei Gongren Assassinating the Tiger" originally had four sections, all of which are obvious examples. Although this piece is not divided into sections, it uses Wen Shengcai's deeds as an introduction and the Huang Hua Gang event as the main text, making it a relatively long piece. As for the historical materials, I thank Brother A Ying for lending me the "Guangdong Uprising Compilation," which prevented me from indulging in speculation. Although the human world is ever-changing, the way of heaven is unpredictable. If you are willing to seek happiness for the people, you should not be afraid of suffering yourself. Grieving at the times, I wipe away heroic tears and use a few rustic words to mourn the country's demise, lamenting the corruption of the Qing Dynasty's late reign, the Empress Dowager's interference, and the court officials' servile and shameless behavior, completely forgetting the three hundred years of national subjugation. Four enlightened people tried to do what they could, only suspecting that the imperial system was going to abandon the reformists, and people's hearts were not of one mind, and they would support the emperor as well as reform. The secret was not kept, and the Empress Dowager found out, and an edict caused the Six Gentlemen to suffer. Internal affairs were neglected, leading to foreign insults, and the Boxers relied on their power and became arrogant. The Eight-Nation Alliance broke through Beijing, and the Summer Palace became their horse pasture. The Chinese nation suffered a collective humiliation, which ignited the nameless and uncontrollable fire in the hearts of patriotic heroes.</p>
<p>At that time, everyone was terrified at the mention of this person, Sun Yat-sen, the leader of the Tongmenghui. For many years, Sun Yat-sen had been running around for the revolution without success, and had been exiled abroad due to being pursued. Seeing the difficulties of the times, he could not sit idly by, and hurriedly gathered comrades to discuss. He said, "The Qing emperor and his ministers have long been spiritually dead and buried in the grave. Let's take advantage of the last breath of life to restore the Han rivers and mountains with one heart." After the meeting, Shi Jianru was sent to sneak into Guangdong Province, and Zheng Shiliang was sent to start an uprising in Huizhou City. Who knew that support was lacking and both failed, Shi Jianru lost his life and Zheng Shiliang fled. Sun Yat-sen persevered without being discouraged, and thus staged this tragic historical drama, the Huang Hua Gang Uprising.</p>
<p>At that time, the forces supporting the emperor still existed, and the reformist party still had Tang Caichang as a survivor. Sadly, he was captured and executed for launching an uprising in Wuhan, and Qin Lishan was implicated in Anhui. From then on, the more the revolutionaries sacrificed, the stronger their will became. As the Xinhai year approached, the efforts of the revolution gradually intensified. The spring sunshine was bright on the tenth day of the third lunar month when a shocking event occurred in Guangzhou City. General Fu Qi, who also served as the Guangzhou General Commander, went to Yantang to watch the air force drills. After watching the planes, he returned to the governor's office, and as he passed by the Provincial Assembly, he was about to turn a corner. Suddenly, a loud shout came from the crowd, "Where are you going, you dog official!" A man with a short stature rushed out, holding a short gun and firing at Fu Qi, several shots rang out, and Fu Qi was wounded. Although there were dozens of guards, everyone was in a panic at the sound of the gunshots, and they abandoned the general and fled. The brave man charged back and forth as if he were in an empty realm, and fired another shot at Fu Qi, sending him to meet the King of Hell. In the chaos, he discarded the short gun and left. Who knew that a patrolman secretly followed him and encountered a Henan detective team on Yongsheng Street, which captured the brave man and sent him to the barracks. The three judicial offices interrogated him, but the brave man, with iron chains on his body, remained calm. He said, "My name is Wen Shengcai, and I am from Shunde. What are you beasts in official robes asking about? My original intention was to kill a tiger, but I mistakenly identified the imperial entourage and killed a sheep. So be it, I killed this thief to avenge the nation, as a warning to all of you, you must be fair. You ask me how many party members there are, there are truly thousands upon thousands, an endless sea of people. I see that you are all descendants of the Yellow Emperor, honorable Chinese, why are you willing to flatter the enemy and act as accomplices? Kill me! Let you claim credit and receive rewards, and get promoted. Haha! You must be careful in the days to come." Wen Shengcai faced death bravely without any fear, and did not implicate others during the interrogation. On March 16th, he received an edict, and on the 17th, he resolutely went to the execution ground. On the way, he kept laughing loudly, his expression calm and composed. He even advised his compatriots to fight for the Han people. With the sound of a cannon, his head fell to the ground. Martyr Wen, his name is still fragrant today. (End of Part 1)</p>
<h3>Clear Skies After the Rain</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Praising Renrui's One Seed with Three Blossoms; Recounting Friendship, Two Gentlemen Meet Heroes</p>
<p>Some kindergarten students, who had left for eight or nine years, had trees that had not only grown taller than people but had also become lush forests. Some had just planted trees, just sprouting tender buds and branches, but they all wanted to see the trees they had planted themselves with their childhood feelings. Therefore, Principal Zhang would hold a reunion every year in May or June, when the trees were lush, inviting kindergarten students who had left the kindergarten and their parents to the kindergarten for a day of pleasant conversation. Various refreshments would be prepared, and they would sing or play games under the shade of the trees in the garden. The old kindergarten students who had graduated and the new kindergarten students who had not graduated were as loving as brothers and sisters. Seeing their own trees thriving, they really felt reluctant to leave. This year, at the reunion, one of the so-called old kindergarten students, who had been born in the women's and children's hospital here. He was an orphan, his father had died early, and his mother was not in good health, so he was also raised in the orphanage and had been a kindergarten student in the kindergarten. Now he was a second-year junior high school student, and the tung tree he planted was also very tall. Everyone elected him to give a speech. In his speech, there were a few words that, although somewhat childish, were very touching. He said, "I am fourteen years old this year, and it seems that I have already left the kindergarten life. But I still envy the happiness of the younger brothers and sisters. It's a pity that I can't shrink my body and be as big as them. It's a pity that this reunion is only one day. It would be great if it lasted for more than a week. But no matter what happens in the future, I will definitely come every year. I want to sit in the house where I was born, and I want to look at the tree I planted. I will definitely come every year, until my hair turns white, I am still an old kindergarten student of this kindergarten, I am considered an old brother among the younger brothers and sisters." Dr. Zhang Ting was also very touched when she heard this, and held his hand and just wouldn't let go. Now, because it was a clear autumn day, it was not suitable for outdoor activities. Although they were divided into four groups, they were still in one house, sometimes singing and playing games, and sometimes together. In this house, there were specially made small tables and small chairs. Each nanny managed a group. The clothes were also the same. The younger brothers wore black clothes, which were the clothes for the young boys. The younger sisters wore white clothes, which were the clothes for the young girls. Today, Ms. Tong Haiying heard that the two young girls, He Zong, had come to visit the kindergarten with Zhu Ai, and she personally came to entertain them. She asked the kindergarten students to bow to the two young ladies of the He family, and she herself played the organ, selecting the interesting little sisters who sang well, and sang for the two young ladies to listen to. It is exactly:</p>
<p>Several lines of ranks, new phoenix shadows, a song heard, the sound of farewell wind.</p>

<h3>In a World Filled with Gunpowder, Hollywood War Films are in a Frenzy—Arms Rental Businesses are Booming</h3>
<p>— Daizi (Fool)</p>
<p>The Spanish war has not ended, the Sino-Japanese war is still in progress, and the powder keg of Europe, Czechoslovakia, is about to explode. In a world filled with the smell of gunpowder, Hollywood film companies have recently been competing to produce war epics.</p>
<p>In the film city, many studios have recently been filled with the sounds of swords and guns, presenting a tense military situation. Female stars apply menthol to their eyelids, so that when the male lead goes off to war, tears will naturally flow in their smiles. Every war film is like this.</p>
<p>Currently, Hollywood is producing all the war films it can. After Paramount's "Invasion" is completed, it may even allow us to discover a film that exposes plunder.</p>
<p>When Griffith was filming "The Birth of a Nation," a lot of money was spent on the war scenes. But now, the war films produced by various companies cost even more than back then. Temporary soldiers are paid $10.50 per day, and the rental fee for guns is $50 per thousand.</p>
<p>At Selznick's studio, the nighttime war scenes for "Gone With the Wind" have already begun filming. The burning of Atlanta scene is very grand. And these war scenes are all filmed using directorial techniques, and some of them are very magnificent.</p>
<p>There is a man named Stanbridge in Hollywood who has a large collection of weapons. He also keeps a lot of ancient weapons at Paramount Pictures. When film companies need weapons for war films, they rent them from him. Recently, the demand has surged, and he has made a fortune.</p>
<p>Because of the recent competition among companies to produce war films, Stanbridge's arms rental business has become very busy. "Hotel Imperial" needed 250 Austrian-style rifles, and the number of Russian-style rifles needed was equally large. At the same time, he also loaded these guns with smokeless powder, and the cartridges were filled with black gunpowder, which were used differently for daytime and nighttime filming.</p>
<p>Even in "Union Pacific," although it is not a true war film, when McCrea and his men resisted the Indian uprising, they used 210 rifles; and those rioters were at a disadvantage because they were holding old-fashioned rifles from 1863. Similarly, in "Heritage of the Desert," there is a scene that uses 50 rifles.</p>
<p>Stanbridge's biggest deal was to supply hundreds of new Spencer rifles and all the machine guns in his collection. But the problem of anti-aircraft guns and heavy artillery arose. The government may be able to help; but some of the weapons must be designed by the film company, so that people can get a deep impression, even though it is not a formal battle. When Warner began filming "Juarez," the war scenes would be filmed in Burr Place, and they had 400 old-fashioned rifles and some new guns, which was enough for the background of the film.</p>
<p>"Dodge City," starring Errol Flynn, needed 100 bulky old-fashioned guns and some small-caliber pistols. But there were not enough of them, so the extras who were not actually fighting all used fake guns made of rubber.</p>
<p>In Stanbridge's armory, there are a total of 660 British-made Lee-Enfield rifles. Recently, they have been transported to RKO every day in trucks, for the purpose of filming "Gunga Din." From now on, the same guns will have to be repaired and prepared for use in the war scenes of "The Light That Failed."</p>
<h3>Charlie Chaplin's Fiftieth Birthday</h3>
<p>— Lu Degang</p>
<p>The silver screen humor master Charlie Chaplin is fifty years old this year. He was born on April 16, 1889, in Brixton. His father was a stage singer of some local renown, who died early, leaving behind a poor family. Chaplin's mother worked hard to raise Chaplin and his younger brother. At the age of fourteen, Chaplin played a supporting role in the play "Sherlock Holmes." At the age of seventeen, he joined the Karno Troupe as a clown. Later, through an introduction, he transferred to another theater troupe and went to perform in the New World. Soon after arriving in the United States, he was hired by Keystone Film Company as an actor. From then on, he rose rapidly, and his fame grew day by day. In total, almost every film he made after becoming famous was a sell-out. Chaplin's ability to attract audiences was not due to good fortune, nor was it due to his tattered boots and cane, but entirely due to his outstanding artistic talent and diligent training.</p>
<p>To commemorate the 50th birthday of this great artist, the entire United States will hold banquets to celebrate. At the same time, movie theaters across the country will exclusively screen films about Chaplin's life for a week. Therefore, recently, various production companies have been copying Chaplin's old films day and night in order to transport them to various places for screening. Chaplin has this honor, which is enough to be proud of!</p>
<h3>Wang Xianzai and His Wife Join Xinhua Together</h3>
<p>— Yin Si</p>
<p>Star's Previous Negotiation Encountered Twists and Turns Xinhua Still Permits Future Borrowing at Any Time</p>
<p>Wang Xianzai, recently returned to Shanghai from Sichuan and Yunnan not long ago, has become a new prey in the film industry, immediately arousing competition among various companies to recruit him. Because he is a unique and outstanding talent for villain roles, he is truly "rare and valuable," and everyone needs him. Xinhua Film Company was represented by Han Langen to negotiate, and they first agreed on the contract terms. At the same time, Star Film Company, based on the long-term relationship between old hosts and guests, insisted that he must return to his old home. As a result, Wang Xianzai was in a dilemma and felt very hesitant. Seeing this stalemate, Star Film Company immediately asked Bian Yuying, the business director of Huacheng Film Company, to negotiate with Xinhua, requesting that he be allowed to return to Star Film Company for employment. Xinhua also accepted the request, in order to show consideration for the friendship of the industry. Later, Star Film Company learned that Wang Xianzai had already signed the contract and sent it to Xinhua; therefore, they did not want to destroy this accomplished fact and make him break the contract, and finally expressed their willingness to give way to Xinhua Film Company. At this point, the Xinhua authorities signed a contract with Wang Xianzai as a solution. Wang also determined his way out and joined the Xinhua camp. However, if Star Film Company needs Wang Xianzai for filming in the future, Xinhua can still borrow him at any time, relying on friendship. As a result of this outcome, everyone felt very satisfied. At the same time, Wang's wife, Yuan Zhu-ru, also signed a long-term contract and joined Xinhua with him.</p>
<h3>Jizi's Drama Talk</h3>
<p>— Baochu</p>
<p>Ge Shishan is both vigorous and graceful, Yang Baosen's singing is melodious</p>
<p>Hiding from Qin on an isolated island, suffering a lot, occasionally entering the singing arena, also to borrow wine to dispel sorrow and long songs for crying. A few days ago, I was invited by a friend to visit the Golden Theater. When I arrived, Baosen's "Scolding Cao" was just coming on stage. The introduction, the setting, and the dialogue were all smooth and flawless, and the enunciation was strong and clean. The "flowing water" and "two sides" were pure and correct. The drumming can be called a masterpiece. Baosen and Baozhong both regard drumming as the standard for the current old student actors. The flexibility of the wrist and the crispness of the strikes, even Shu Yan and Fu Ying may sigh in admiration. I watched Guan Shaohua perform this before, and honestly, everything from Kuai downward is not worth mentioning. If Baosen can put more effort into facial expressions and costume plays, then he can be considered the successor to Shu Yan. There is no need to imagine a second person. Once, I watched him perform "Visiting Mother" with Zhang Eyun. During the crying scene and parting, Yan Hui raised his left foot as if to leave, and according to the routine, Liu Lang (played by Guan Shengxi) should kneel and hold his foot to show that he could not bear to let him go, which would show the emotions of the brothers. But Baosen raised his foot, and Liu Lang looked at it and rejected it, as if he wanted to reason but didn't. In reality, Sen had to stretch out and then withdraw. Not only those who watched felt uncomfortable, but the performer himself must have had strange feelings. Shengxi's voice is loud and the inside acting of an old man is outstanding. I hope he does not become arrogant, which would hinder his progress. After "Scolding Cao" was "Jinshan Temple," in which Yan Shishan played the White Snake in "Flooding Jinshan." The singing and speaking in the water battle and the fighting were all amazing. It is said that this play was personally taught by his uncle, "Nine Whirlwinds," and is the same as what Mei Lanfang performed. His makeup is charming, his posture is agile, and his balance on the stilts is steady. Among today's female roles, there is probably no one who surpasses him. Shishan is capable of many plays, such as "Hu Family Village," "Female Killing Four Doors," etc. This time, I have not yet seen him perform. I hope the authorities of the Golden Theater can arrange for him to perform them one by one and satisfy the eyes of the Shanghai people. Eyun then performed "Broken Bridge Offering Pagoda." According to the original "Broken Bridge" belongs to Kunqu Opera, but Eyun performed it in Luan Tan, which is inevitably inferior. Sheng Lan is capable in Kunqu, but that night he could not show his strength, which is really disappointing.</p>
<h3>Entertainment News</h3>
<p>The 30th collection of "Honglian Temple" new play at the Gongwu Stage will be staged next Friday (31st). If rehearsals are not ready, it may be postponed to around April 3rd.</p>
<p>The Yifeng Drama Society at the Carlton Theater rehearsed two versions of "Wen Su Chen" last night, but the performance date has not yet been determined, possibly in a week or so.</p>

Cade General Manager Dong Yong telegraphed to the Gengxin authorities to speak for her.</p>
<p>Female Dan Wang Xichun and Jin Suwen were sent by Chen Shaopeng from the United Film Company to the backstage of the Carlton Theater the night before to discuss the costume issues for the film "Wen Su Chen."</p>
<p>The Yin Xing Dance Troupe was hired by the Suzhou Grand Theater in Suzhou and is scheduled to depart on April 1st and take the stage on the 6th. The main actors are Xu Xu, Jin Liwa, and Chuan Ruiying.</p>
<p>The female actor who plays male roles, Yu Guifen, has had a recurrence of her stomach illness and is currently taking agarwood painkillers, which is very painful for her.</p>
<p>Another portrait of a certain lady: Since this lady's photograph was published in this journal, many readers have written to inquire about her background, current situation, ... and even several people have requested to meet her; I have already forwarded all the letters. According to her, "I am currently working hard to learn Mandarin, dance, music, and performing arts, etc., and it is not yet time for public presentation, please readers look forward to it."</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City's Palace and the Pear Garden in the Old Capital (131)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Main Reason for Releasing Cao at Huarong Road</p>
<p>"Huarong Road" is a famous play by Da Tou (Big Head), and also an important show for Hongsheng (red-faced role) and Jing (painted-face role) to sing and dialogue. After Da Tou's death, Wang Fengqing also often performed it. Those in Shanghai who sing red-face plays mostly follow the San Mazi (Wang Hongshou) school. Twenty years ago, there was a person in Shanghai famous for performing Guan plays. In addition to Wang, who enjoyed the reputation of living Guan Gong, there were also Xia Yuerun and Zhao Ruquan. Zhao's performance was sometimes too casual, which led to the nickname of "slippery Guan Gong." San Mazi, being a member of the Anhui opera troupe, had a deep understanding of both singing and acting. His masterpieces, such as "Zhan Jing Tang," "Sao Song Xia Shu," "Xu Zai Pao Cheng," and "Xue Yong Lan Guan," are still models for later generations. People like Qi Lin Tong and Lin Shusen all took Wang as their model. Wang was born with phoenix eyes, which gave him a bit of majesty after dressing up. Moreover, he was very pious in worshiping Guan Di. Before each Guan play, he would fast and bathe, burn incense and kowtow. The next day, when he went to the backstage to dress up, he would also burn sandalwood in the room, kowtow, and then begin to dress up. From this time on, he would no longer talk to anyone. Before going on stage, he would sit high on a chair, and all the supporting characters in the play, such as Zhou Cang and Guan Ping, would kowtow to him, considering himself as a character in the play. Because he meticulously studied Guan Yu's character with great sincerity, and poured all his energy into performance, acting, recitation, and singing, his performance of Guan plays was naturally superior to everything else and worthy of the nickname of living Guan Gong. After his death, Lin Shusen and Jin Shaoshan jointly recorded a record of "Huarong Road." The flowing water sections they sang were extremely moving, and therefore publicized this play.</p>
<p>A very strange question is that since Kongming clearly knew that Cao Cao would take the Huarong Path after being defeated, he could have easily sent a general to capture Aman, who slipped through the net. However, he insisted on letting the brave and invincible Guan Yunchang take the military order, establish a military pledge, and let the powerful enemy go. This led to the various strange dramas of palace coups and usurpation. The four hundred years of the Yan Han Dynasty were eventually plundered by the Cao family. Isn't this clearly showing that Mr. Zhuge was taking Liu's dynasty too lightly? In fact, there is a great truth in this. For many years, not only the people who watched the play "Huarong Road" did not guess it, but also the people who read the Three Kingdoms thoroughly did not expect it. Bu Wang also heard it from an old opera fan. I will write it out and ask the experts for criticism and instruction.</p>
