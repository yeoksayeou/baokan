<p>社評</p>
<h3>紀念「三一八」</h3>
<p>今天是北平天安門慘案的十三週年紀念日。天安門慘案是日本假手中國所謂執政政府屠殺北平革命民衆，以遂其「以華制華」的陰謀毒計的一幕。當時中國的革命運動，雖很普遍，但主觀方面未能動員廣大農工羣衆參加，革命力量異常脆弱，客觀方面所謂執政政府有日本扶助，鎭壓革命的力量，相當强固；所以這一决的革命運動，終於被鎭壓下去。可是這碧血的敎訓，已播下了抗戰建國的種子了。時至今日，他們為爭取生存和自由起見，已聯合一致，抵抗着日本的侵略。現在戰爭已進入第二階段，日軍在華已陷入進退維谷的境地，而國內經濟又不堪負荷這巨大的戰費，於是她就更積極地行使其「以華制華」的陰謀毒計，廣事收買地痞流氓土匪，冀圖充實傀儡政權，分散中國抗戰實力，以遂其侵略的目的。在這種情形之下，中國重又逢到這天安門慘案的紀念日，鑑往勵來，是有深切的意義的。</p>
<p>天安門慘案是在這樣的政治背景之下產生的：民國十三年，奉直戰爭之後，日本的工具奉系軍閥就乘機入關，伸張其勢力於華北華中，奉系地盤的擴大，實際上就是日本在華勢力的伸張。翌年十月，浙江軍閥孫傳芳組織浙閩蘇皖贛五省聯軍，發動反奉戰爭。那時適値五卅運動之後，中國民衆已淸楚地認識奉系軍閥是日本鎮壓革命運動的工具。所以孫傳芳就利用羣衆的反奉情緖，以反對奉系軍閥壓迫愛國運動相號召。在這種號召之下，獲得了一部份民衆的同情與援助，所以聯軍不但連戰連捷，而且影響了一部份奉系軍閥也傾向於反奉。郭松齡的倒戈由此而起。奉系軍閥大有迅速崩潰之勢。日本眼看她的工具，行將失其效用，於是便直接帮忙，消滅了郭松齡的武力，替他解除了後顧之患。</p>
<p>在反奉戰爭中，中國民衆就利用這個機會，把革命運動一天一天地展開。另一方面，又影響了一部份前進的軍人，使他們也轉向到革命的隊伍中來。馮玉祥將軍領導的國民軍便是在這個時候轉向過來的。這種武力，因為接近民衆，有民衆的擁護，所以勢力也一天一天地擴大起來，不久就奄有平津冀察綏豫等地了。</p>
<p>革命勢力的進佔，對於日本的侵華運動是有相當的打擊的，於是她便進而號召直奉的聯合，供直系以巨欽，供奉系以軍械子彈及軍事人才，以圖消滅國民軍。在另一方面，又扶助李景林張宗昌所統率的直魯聯軍進攻河北的國民軍。十五年三月，國民軍在津南連敗直魯聯軍，聲勢大振，日本艦隊就砲轟大沽砲台，勾引奉艦襲取天津，以為張李的應援，並且運用公使團的嚴重通牒，施行威嚇。但中國民衆絕不妥恊，堅决反對日艦砲轟大沽與直奉聯合。北平民衆特於十八日召開國民大會，向執政政府請願。而那時的執政政府竟執行了日本的指示，開槍射擊請願民衆，造成了這天安門的慘案。</p>
<p>從這些事實看來，過去日本在中國，是一再扶助反動勢力，出面打擊革命力量，以遂其侵略的企圖的。所以中國這一决的抗戰，就歷史的意義上說，並不是只在淸算「九一八」或「七七」事變以後的血賬，而是在淸算歷史上累積下來的血賬。現在抗戰進入第二階段，中國民衆，看到日本侵華軍事上沒有辦法，積極利用昔日屠殺民衆的手段來充實傀儡政權，加重其「以華制華」的陰謀毒計的時候。來紀念這慘案的十三週年紀念，更有重大意義。惟有踏着「三一八」諸先烈的血路前進，於軍事動員之外，更從事政治的動員，粉碎日本一切狠毒的陰謀，來爭取獨立和自由！</p>
<h3>羅斯福敦促　通過關島設防案　所用方式或當變更　蘇聯實行拍賣漁塲　日曬古巴在僞國增兵</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）關島建造航空根據地一案、前經衆議院吾决之後、卽有擱置之說、羅斯福總統頃與參議院海軍委員會主席華爾許、（其人原持反對態度）談話後、又决定予以提出、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯當局已在海參崴為各漁塲投標、日本漁業並未參加一事、茲已證實此項漁塲，共有二百九十三處其中四處、投標結果、頃已揭曉、均為蘇聯漁業公司所得、共餘二百八十九處、當在兩星期之後、再度投標、日蘇兩國、在此期間、或可成立折衷方案、而由日本漁業參加投標、亦未可知、此間主管人士頃宣稱、蘇聯當局僅欲將日本向所經營之漁塲、收回四十處、不擬進一步採取他項措置云、（十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省發言人頃稱、柬京巳接得正式情報、內稱、本月十五日蘇聯政府已在海參崴片面的舉行拍賣漁區、但未接關於拍賣結果之情報、故日本漁區向來免被拍賣者、今是吾已被拍賣、尙未知之云、聞外務省刻待拍賣結果之詳細情報到後、再定此後步驟、（十七日路透電）</p>

<p>陽朔通訊，在陽朔縣政府抄到了本城十九位出征人的姓名，决心去找幾位衛國健兒的家屬談談。</p>
<p>縣前街的一條小巷底的拐角處，對着沿離江的矮矮的城墻，有一家門前有六七級整齊的石階的屋子。在這家書香門第裏，找到了出征人陳錫偉的大哥錫鑫，和正在縣立中學初中讀書的三弟錫誥。錫偉今年二十八歲，先後在幹訓班和無錢電學校畢業，蘆溝橋事變後，便自勁投廖磊部參加抗戰。看到他最近由安微立煌縣寄來的家書，大意說：「……前寄兩函勉弟，時切懸念。現身體如恒，勿念。聞桂（林）柳（州）平（樂）等處亦受損失，望鑫兄及諸弟，於我縣雙灘地方早結茅舍暫居，一則免受驚恐，二則有餘地可以耕食。……」云云。雖然簡單地只寫了一張信紙，却可灼見他攘外安內，衛國愛家的熱忱。</p>
<p>他的妻子帶着幼子回娘家賀年去了。我看到他兩個在中心小學讀書的兒子，據說最小的一個也已進幼稚園，廣西省原定出征人家屬每年可得優待米穀三百斤。從去年冬季開始，分四期按季發放。他們已收到七十五斤穀子的代金桂幣九元（法幣四元五角）。他的兄弟和兒子，都認自己的兄弟和父親的出征是件光榮的事。</p>
<p>我所訪問的第二個出征人的家屬，是鄭橋橋的老父和大哥。他們的屋子在市街外面，被包裹在一片片綠油油的菜圃中間。一條已經被走得發滑的亂石小徑，在他家屋邊穿過，他們有塊菜園，現在由老父耕種着。他的大哥是屠夫，沒有農夫的氣分。</p>
<p>橋橋行二，今年二十七歲，受過後備訓練，妻已故，兩個小兄弟免費在縣立小學讀書，出征後，家庭並沒有受多大影響。他的老父把我常做一個熟朋友地對我說：一橋橋是二十六年八月初四日，第一决應徵出征的。我直送他到桂林北門才回來，後來他在全縣編隊，再開拔到北邊去，我們曾接到從漢口發來的一封信，記得大意是說，「我們不打到上海，就要打出山海關。」呌我們不要掛念。道孩子倒是有志氣的，聽說現在升當排長了。」他一面指着在他屋子東面的另一個菜圃裏的屋子說：「那邊謝四九的兒子謝七金，就在橋橋的一排裏面。」</p>
<p>「政府優待出征人家屬，我們已收到幾塊桂幣。縣長叉賞了我們五毫子（法幣二角五分），還拿到幾個粑粑和兩包餅食。」這位快六十歲的老園丁，很樂意地講給我聽。我乘機恭維了他幾句，他忽然記起要請我喝茶，我謝謝他說：「我還想到謝七金家去呢！」他才一面仍呌大兒子燒茶，一面帶着笑把我送出園門。</p>
<p>謝七金的父親雖也在挿菜園，家境就不像有一個殺猪的兒子的老園丁家那麽好。兩間屋子，一間是堂屋，也是灶房，一間是臥室和猪欄，他似乎不大和外邊人講話，不懂我的話，我也難懂他的話，說了好久，我才知道七金是十八歲，還沒有娶婦，前年八月初出征，已收過九塊桂幣，其他的東西據說沒有拿到。</p>
<p>眼睛有些糢糊的謝四九，又從懷裏掏出他兒子的來信給我看，　　：二他身體很好，請家裹不要掛念一類的話。</p>
<p>當我跨出謝四九的菜圃時，陽朔城郊的山峯都沒在雲海裏，霧氣很濃，吹在面上有些像小雨點。遍野葱蘢，觸目成趣，我看時間還早，就順着亂石小徑，穿出那像石橋洞似的，一手可以攀到的古城門，向着一個圓錐體的獨秀峯走去，謝四九吿訴我，李橋生家，就在獨秀峯下。</p>
<p>繞過一帶水田，漸聽到潺潺的水聲，路一轉，就看見分做三疊，每疊的一尺多的澗水從高處瀉入一個澄碧的水潭。再從一塊浮在水面上的大岩石下流過，灣一灣，就是一座圓孔的小橋。橋石上的靑苔和石縫裹的小花草，似乎在對我報吿它的古老的歷史，水流過橋，便又發着細細的水聲，走向我所不知道的地方去了。踏過岩石，李橋生的三間瓦屋和兩間茅房的獨家村，就在松竹和一些熱帶樹的後面露了出來。這小橋流水人家，把我引進了一個靈妙的詩境。同時又像看到一幅王　的「溪山烟雨」圖，那種超凡絕俗的景色，送來了出塵之想。</p>
<p>我看到一個少婦，戴着竹笠，排着桶子向另一方向去。雖然不能斷定她是李橋生的妻子，却知道是這獨家村中的一員，跨進籬門，任一頭小白狗在我身後低低的吠，走過小小的晒坪，向着瓦屋裏走去。</p>
<p>一位白髮的老婦對我這位不速之客表示驚奇的歡迎，她承認是李橋生的外婆，她正用松柴在堂屋裏着地生火取暖，松柴還是濕的，發出刺人眼鼻的白烟，我就在火堆邊拉了一張矮凳坐下，問起李橋生的家屬，於是她吿訴我：橋生的母親到市上賣菜去了，橋生的老婆，為着家裏養了兩頭猪，才出去挑猪食。</p>
<p>她就急忙的以大步跑出屋去，站在籬門外面，用一種像中年婦人那麼響脆的聲音呌着，接着又聽到另一陣洪大的聲音也在呌着，感謝四山的廻音，這位可親愛的老婆婆只呌了三聲，就把她的外孫媳婦呌了回來。</p>
<p>李橋生的妻子把担子擱在晒坪上，像一個靑年的農夫似的，隨着老外婆走進堂屋裏來，她去掉那頂又大又圓，油得又黃又亮的竹笠，探出用藍花布裹着的頭，白凈的臉，細長的眉毛，一對凝重的大眼睛，是一個廣西少見的美麗農婦，寬大的胸部說明她正有一個要哺乳的孩子，露着小腿的靑布單褲，赤着雙大脚，表示和其他廣西的農婦一樣的健强和勤苦。問起她的丈夫，她囁嚅地說不出口，幸虧那位老婆婆在代我一句句轉問她，只才慢慢地回答我。</p>
<p>李橋生是她的贅婿，今年二十七歲，結婚後就應徵入伍，到今年巳足足五年。前年六月間，蘆溝橋事變，本省的軍隊都開到北方去，　過陽朔，回家住了三天，現在家裏有母親妹妹外婆和一個生出來就別離父親的男孩子。</p>
<p>走進一間黑暗的房裏去拿了兩封已經碎爛了的信，給我說：「最近的一封，送到縣政府去了，（後來知道，廣西省政府會令各縣微集出征人的可以做模範的家書。）這是前年和去年七月間的來信。」我看第一封上寫着「李橋生的母收」，裏面講起「出征人有證，可免一切民工小費，若是鄕公所要你去的民工，拿證去看，身體强壯，不必掛念。」第二封信是從「江西萍鄕安源六十二後方醫院」發的。無疑是「掛彩一了；但信裏沒有提起，只說身體很好。看他的妻子，也還沒有知道。</p>
<p>我問起「優待的事，李橋生的妻子就興奮起來。她吿訴我：「去年底，收到九塊桂幣。縣長還親自送粑粑和餅食到這裏來。」又指着堂屋正中門板上的為國爭光一的紅紙條說：「他還為我們貼上這一張好光彩的字條呢！」</p>
<p>看看門前的山色漸漸的暗下來，就和她們吿辭了，黑暗的戾裹傳來一陣嬰兒的啼聲，我請這位年靑的母親快去照護孩子，但推却不了那位老婆婆的盛情，把我送出籬落，當我走過那塊浮在澗水上的大岩石，回頭向獨秀峯下的獨家村作最後的瞥視時，她還站在那裏，李橋生的妻子抱了一個肥胖的兒子靠近她，那頭小白狗在她們的脚邊搖着短尾巴，我揮揮手請她們進去，亂石小徑一拐灣，就給帶雨的林樹給隔斷了。</p>

<p>字林報云、江蘇北部因有軍事行動、而局勢緊張、該地人民千餘人、分乘數船、於昨日（十六日）逃來上海、先經駐守十二號碼頭之公共租界巡捕縝密檢查、然後登陸、據其中搭英輪克力斯丁馬勒輪來滬者談、彼等因蘇北局勢緊張而來此云、</p>
<p>携帶被褥　等雜物者、佔大多數、可見彼等欲在此勾留若干時日也、該英輪亦自江北載來豕鷄與其他貨物、華方消息前傳江北沿江區域戰雲密佈、華方正規軍與游擊隊達九萬人之多、兼程馳往各衝要地點、準備進攻日軍云、昨據此等來滬者談、尚未正式開始反攻、泰州迤北與邵伯之戰事、已在進行中、彼等來滬前數日</p>
<p>曾有戰事　至彼等起程時、已趨沉寂、泰州以北某村已陷落、至於前傳華軍已準備進攻之如　·南通·啟東·等區之情況、彼等均不知悉、又傳日軍企圖進攻此等區域、因欲切斷該區中作戰華軍之給養、並圖對鎖此等區域、不准航運、俾任日本航業商獨佔其利云、</p>
<h3>甬紳請購洋米　濟甬民食</h3>
<p>電浙省府轉財部核准</p>
<p>寗波旅滬紳商虞洽卿·金廷蓀等、因甬地本非產米區域、戰後滬埠復又統制米糧轉口、故民食時處不給、曾函寗波縣政府、徵求聯名向浙江省政府請轉呈財部、准予購買外匯、訂購西貢·暹邏·洋米五萬至十萬石、藉以調節浙省民食、業已獲得甬縣府同意、故虞氏等聯名電浙省黃主席請求矣、</p>
<h3>捷克在滬使館　遭德使館接收</h3>

<p>上海捷克僑民、自接得歐洲傳來之最近消息後、頗爲焦慮、彼等對星期三日希特勒突施侵略後所起之發展、表示憤怒、惟大多數捷僑受驚之餘、已不能加以批評矣、該國駐華公使賽巴等曾於十五日前、逐日照常赴本埠海格路七二七號使館內辦公、但外界則頗注視其動態、據前日該公使對外表示、則稱正在等待訓令、比至十六日、該使館大門、忽然緊閉、於是旅滬捷僑、更因此而顯露焦慮、及至昨日（十七日）、據悉該使館已被德使館館派員前往實行接收、而捷克公使賽巴、且已自使館遷出、與其夫人等暫時寄寓某旅館內、自經此項消息傳出後、一般捷僑、甚爲悲憤、但若顰今後之命運與乎在滬經營之商業財產等管轄問題、是否須向德使館辦理移轉管轄手續、或須領取「保護」護照、則尚待事實之開展而決定之矣、上海捷克僑民頗多、昨日尚未能知其確數、在上海社交與商界均佔顯著地位、拔佳鞋公司爲世界最偉大鞋公司之一、即係捷商、僅在上海已有分店不下七家、平時在杭州·漢口·蘇州·天津·與青島、均設有分店、</p>
<h3>外調郵員　即將出發</h3>
<p>局方接受四項要求</p>
<p>最近交通部郵政總局、因湘桂黔三省郵件積　如山、亟待整理、而內地郵員工作效能、較爲遲鈍、故令由上海郵政管理局遴派幹練郵員六十五人、分赴各該省工作、郵局奉令後、即經就幹練郵員中遴派六十五人、並以局令發表、限期本月十六日須一律出發、各被調人員得訊後、以事出倉卒、不及佈置行裝、且待遇菲薄、尤感困難叢多、當經呈由郵務工會向局方交涉、要求取消上項命令、改由自願者報名外調、但未獲當局允可、於是引起各郵員不滿、</p>

<h3>評價委員會　調查米棧存糧</h3>
<p>到貨頗旺米價續跌嚴重情勢漸成過去</p>
<h3>函當局妥籌善策以維永久</h3>
<p>上海米業團體評價委員會、昨致函兩租界當局、陳報成立經過、並將評定米價單送請備查、以後滬市存米、規定隨時調查辦法、連日到貨甚旺、米價益趨穩定、茲探錄詳情於後、</p>
<p>派員隨時調查存糧　米業團體評價委員會鑒於存糧盈虛、所關米價甚大、爰已派定專員、隨時向各米棧進行調查、並編定調查表格一種、內分棧名·經理姓名·容量·米棧地址·等項目、頗爲詳盡、該項調查表、於調查完竣後、除分送七米業團體外、並報告兩租界當局備查、此項手續、該會昨已分函各米棧予以協助矣、</p>
<p>到貨頗旺米價續跌　自荳米業公會剴勸販商復運、並繼續採辦後、連日到貨頗旺、米價繼續趨跌、白粳每石已回跌至十三元四五角、或七八角不等、皆在評定限價之下、聞各販運客商、遵荳米業公會勸告、均在繼續採辦之中、來源將益見轉旺、故本市米糧嚴重情勢、漸成過去、</p>
<p>評定米價陳報備查　昨分函公共租界工部局、暨法租界公董局函云「敬啟者、查近來滬市民食、因受內地米糧直接裝輪他運影響、以致來源稀少、米價步漲、曾由豆米行業公會議決、維持原定限價、最高白米每石不得超過十四元、並將經過情形、於本月八日函報貴局備案、嗣後市塲限價、雖幸未踰越、而中次各米、一致騰漲、市面微覺混亂、各米業團體認爲米價不能平準、所關民食甚巨、爰於本月十三日、復由豆米行業公會邀集米號業公會·經售米糧業公會·滬北運米客商聯益會·碾米業公會·常熟公所·南幫公所·各團體代表共同議決、組織評價委員會、依據豆米行業公會規定限價、隨時評定價格、中次照別、期以行客號三方之合作、共維米價之平準、當由各團體推定委員十五人、於本月十五日召集第一次委員會議、訂定簡章、宣告成立、此敝委員會之組織緣由也、惟當此存糧雖未感缺少、而來源仍不克暢旺之際、欲求米價之始終平準、深恐棉力不勝重任、尚祈貴局妥籌善策、共維民食、此尤敝委員會所深切企禱者也、茲謹檢同委員會簡章、委員名單、及評定米價單、備函陳報、至希詧照存查、無任公感」、</p>
<h3>日方阻撓外輪航運　海門又遭砲轟</h3>
<p>各公司將請求領事交涉復航辦法勢必暫緩實行</p>
<p>浙江海門、十五日復遭日艦發砲轟擊、損失甚微、當地情形安謐如常、甬台綫準備復航、滬台綫復航尚有待、滬定航綫、准許專輪裝魚、哈納輪將於二十日首次由定復航來滬、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>日艦一再砲轟海門　日艦向浙東海門迭次發砲轟擊、大肆騷擾、均告失敗後、頃據航業界接得報告、本月十五日下午四時、復有日艦四艘、由大門山方面駛至椒江口封鎖綫附近、先放下汽艇游弋窺伺、旋向海門市區發砲轟擊達八九十發、傷九人、毀民房數十間、餘無損失、其中日艦二艘、於下午五時許、擄去民船三艘、即他駛、其餘二艘、停泊一宵、亦已他駛、</p>
<p>軍民鎮靜情形安謐　自日方對海門有所企圖後、我軍事當局、即加緊防範、沿海派有重兵駐守、一面並疏散居民、查緝奸徒造謠、日艦雖數度進擾、終因我防務鞏固、未能得逞、十五日再度發砲轟擊時、我軍沉着應付、日艦見我有備、除發砲作無目標之濫轟外、別無異動、故目下海門情形、極爲安謐、商店照常營業、居民對日艦發砲轟擊、均已司空見慣、極爲鎮靜、</p>
<p>用意顯屬阻撓通航　海門椒江實施封鎖、航班停頓已久、當局爲疏通運輸、整理椒江水道、重行舉辦航輪登記、準備復航、詎料日方藉口軍事未了、橫加阻撓、未能實現、最近當局准航商之請求、特許已登記航輪、在離海門二十餘里之三江口停泊、起卸客貨、而十五日日艦復向海門發砲轟擊、其用意顯屬阻撓外輪航行、各外輪公司、將請求各該國領事提出交涉、以維航運、</p>
<p>滬台航綫復航有待　溫台防守司令、自准航商之請、准許航輪在三江口停泊起卸客貨後、寗紹公司經理之馬勒輪、曾試航一次、頗爲圓滿、而行駛甬台綫之高登輪、亦準備復航、故滬台綫復航問題頗爲各界所關注、三江口地處偏僻、客貨運清淡、各輪暫不擬復航、故滬台復航、尚將有待、至於甬台綫將先行復航、</p>
<p>定海裝魚臨時復航　浙當局爲鞏固沿海各小港口防務、禁止航輪停靠定海、滬定航綫停頓以來、爲時已久、現當地漁商、爲疏洩魚鮮、已呈准當局、僱定哈納海福爲裝運魚類專輪、直放來滬、惟由滬開往、則須由寗波兼灣、並嚴禁搭客、茲悉哈納輪已定二十日（星期一）由定首次裝魚直放來滬、惟此次復航、仍係臨時性質、</p>

<h3>日新訂交通章程　工部局不重視　似將命巡捕予以遵守　除日僑外不受其約束</h3>
<p>大陸報云、關於日方在蘇州河北屋實行交通新章程、公共租界工部局方面、雖仍在進行正式行動中、官方昨日（十六日）雖亦承認、實行日本海軍陸戰隊所訂定之交通章程、稍已破壞公共租界之行政完整、惟據昨晚現象察之、局方似將命令公共租界巡捕遵守此等規則、記者昨以此事叩詢工部局數人員、彼等</p>
<p>企圖減小　此事之重大關係、據稱、某外國駐軍區之司令官、如認為保障該區內生命財產之更為安全、必須擴大其規則、則似屬正當之舉動云、惟官方迄未發表言論或意向、工部局僅於星期二日接得日方所交送之是項新章程、日本陸戰隊當局</p>
<p>未待局方　答覆、即於次日宣佈是項規則業巳自星期二日即本月十四日起實行、聞工部局今對此交通新章程、仍在考慮中、據局方某員語記者云、局方將考慮此等條例不由工部局實施、而由其他當局實行、是吾為妨害公共租界之完整云、又據他方面聲稱、未得公共租界警務處與外國領事館當局之核准、而實行此新章程、除</p>
<p>日僑以外　他國僑民不致受其影響、例如除日人以外之任何外人、享有領判權者、若違背此新章程之一、則將向其領事館當局控以違背交通章程、惟該領事法庭如不承認日本陸戰隊有增訂規則之合法權者、則向該外人控訴之罪、將自動撤銷、華人與未享領判權之外人違背章程者、將由特一法院受理、蓋特一法院為公共租界內</p>
<p>有權管轄　彼等之唯一法院也、除非特一法院承認日方章程、吾則對違章者、亦不致加以懲罰也、有謂工部局或將向特一法院施加壓力、但局方决無左右外國領事館法庭之權、是以苟特一法院為某數種理由而履行此等章程、其結果必生不公允之歧視、而袒護享有領判權之外人云、據日方之規則、與警務處定章尙無任何逈然相異之處、僅加訂禁止駕車時吸烟·車行速度·停車地點·等</p>
<h3>戰區營利事業所得稅　徵課臨時補充辦法　先就未淪戰區之分支店課徵　但損失甚鉅者經證明得緩徵</h3>

<h3>第二期抗戰宣傳週　今日婦女界宣傳日　指示女同胞工作八項　各婦女團體發表吿女界同胞書</h3>
<p>今日為上海特別市黨部領導下之抗戰宜傳週婦女界宣傳日、上海市婦女團體特聯合發表一吿本市女界同胞書、對於抗建工作、與婦女解放關係之密切、指陳甚詳、並列舉女界同胞今後應努力之工作八項、茲照錄如次、</p>
<p>本市女界同胞們、現在是我們女子眞正求解放爭平等的機會到了、蔣夫人宋美齡女士指示我們、「我們要認識女子解放、不能單單當作一種權利看待、應該當作一種責任看、我們為什麽要求婦女解放、為的是負起我們女子的責任、換一句話說、我們要眞正求得女子的解放、首先就要我們能負起責任、」這眞是至理名言、婦女解放運動中的指針、</p>
<p>在蔣夫人的幾句話當中、把我們過去婦女解放運動中的錯誤、無形的指示了出來、就是我們過去僅在權利上與男十爭平等、如女子經濟獨立、敎育平等、女子參政權等、無非着眼在奪回被男子所一手操縱的應享的權利吧了、這種運動、經過長時期奮鬥的結果、所得的是什麽呢、還不是僅僅一點表面上的勝利嗎、雖然現在女子與男子一樣的可以參加社會活動、繼承遺產、謀業求生、讀書從政等等、實際上根本的權力、仍同過去一樣的在男子的掌握之中、我們所得的、這一點表面上的勝利、反而成為男性中心社會一的一種點綴品和裝飾品吧了、這也不能怪我們女子的不知努力、不肯向上、實在因為歷史的社會的力量太大了、男性中心的社會、不特在我國、即在整個世界上、都有他根深蒂固的長時期的傳統勢力、我們女子以草創的脆弱的力量、與之奮鬥、不論怎樣努力、要想根本推翻有史以來所逐步造成的社會機構、而獲得眞正的男女平等地位、眞是談何容易、惟一的希望、就是把握歷史的機會、在整個民族國家發生大革命的時候、我們就該奮不顧身地起來努力、造成我們在歷史上的偉大功績、表現我們所能貢獻於國家的雄厚力量、不使男子專美於前、那末我們的婦女解放運動、自然在時代的躍進中、而澈底的成功了、實現了、</p>
<p>目前這個階段、正是我們婦女求解放爭平等的千載難逢的良機、我們的國家、我們的民族、在强暴敵寇的侵略進攻之下、正在生死存亡的關頭、經過了二十個月的浴血抗戰、我們國家民族的命運、已由危險的境地而轉向復興的大道、而我們婦女求解放爭平等的願望、也就在這個神聖偉大的時代中可促共實現的、所以蔣夫人指示我們說、「要用我們婦女的力量、來達到全民族同胞的解放、孑算盡了我們的責任、」這就是吿訴我們、在現在求整個民族解放的工作、我們婦女同胞、應該同男子一樣的負起責任來、等到整個民族解放成功的時候、當然我們婦女的解放、也隨之達到了、親愛的諸姑姊妹們、在這第二期抗戰中、我們應該不讓男子獨負艱鉅的責任、我們應該秉承蔣夫人的訓示、負起下面的幾種使命來、（一）提倡節的、（二）勸導生產、（三）推進社會敎育、（四）主持救濟事業、（五）鼓勵壯丁入伍、（六）協助抗戰宣傳、（七）安慰並協助出征軍人家屬、（八）援助出征軍人家屬、舉辦小工藝·傳授農產技術·組亟合作社等、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>「苦悶的象徵」</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>廚川白村說，藝術是苦悶的象徵；我說，戰爭也是苦悶的象徵。</p>
<p>藝術家心有所感，無從發洩，苦悶不堪，只好將他的一腔熱情，寄之於藝術，於是胸中的積鬱，乃得暢洩無遺，從此冉行生活下去。至於他的藝術能吾為當世人所重，能吾傳之後世，他是不問的。然而道樣的藝術，却往往能為當世人所重，允其能傳之後世。</p>
<p>同樣，被壓逼的人民，旣已委曲求全，一再退讓，心中苦悶不堪，而壓逼者還是慾壑難塡，壓福不已，於是他們沒有別的辦法，也就只有起而抗戰，與打擊者以打擊。當時憤激之餘，甚至有以出氣為主，不顧成敗的危險。然而這樣的戰爭，却也往往能够博得勝利，從此擺脫覊軛，達到獨立自由的地步。</p>
<p>於前說，就是所謂「窮而後工」，於後說，當然是「多難興邦」。窮而後工的藝術家，不勝枚舉，而多難興邦的國家，也一一可以指證出來。最近，我國遭遇敵人的壓逼，於是全國團結起來；第二期抗戰開始，於是勝利有了一定的把握，在在都是多難興邦的明證，也就是苦悶的象徵，和藝術一般形，成了為人欣賞的美果。</p>
<p>然而我們知道，苦悶不單見之於藝術家，也見之於熱中名利者；不單見之於被壓這者，也見之於壓逼者，為什麼藝術家與被壓逼者終得有所成就，而熱中名利者與壓逼者，若不是無所成就，那便是有所成就而為人所輕視，為後世所唾駡呢？這沒有別的原故，前者的動機是純潔的，和平的，合乎正義的，所謂得道者多助，後者的動機則是卑汚的，强暴的，反乎正義的，所謂失道者寡助。在情緒上的苦悶雖一樣，其前因後果却大不相同。</p>
<p>我們的敵人就有着壓逼者的苦悶。其苦悶的象徵，常然也是戰爭。可是自從發動戰爭以來，他們的苦悶，不但未能减除，反而有加無已。現在，進旣不能，退又不可，正是深深陷在泥淖裏，其苦悶的流露，在在都可以見得出來．當然他們是絕對不能有所成就的了，而為後世所唾駡，則巳經成了如山的鐵案。</p>
<p>他們在蘇北和鄂中的戰事，以及各地的濫炸與砲轟，我會說牠們是無聊的舉動，名之為「報銷戰」；現在，我也可以說，這是他們的「苦悶的象徵」！</p>
<h3>渡江</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>傍晚，天上漸漸的展開了夜幕，向大地籠罩著，像一層黑的紗幔。又像在風掀起的灰塵，那麽瀰瀰漫漫的，遮掩了田野和村落，朦朧了遼闊的江面。</p>
<p>黃濁的江水上，經過暮色的美化，竟從朦朧中，給了我們許多的便利。朦朧渡過江，就踏進了魔羣盤據的境界呵，腦海中突然浮起迫切的顧望：——驅寇保江！</p>
<p>一隊弟兄，從堤岸上往下斜奔，迅捷地，爬上小船，解開纜，撑起篙；江水被船身激動，就突然湧起了波浪，一浪跟一浪的打起來，震蕩，濺躍，伸縮，水面上像開出了無敬朶野花，搖搖擺擺。</p>
<p>互相連接着的小船，離開堤岸，向江心推進，一切的叢林和草屋都在縮小，那一片斜伏在江邊的軟泥上的脚印，看上去，也祇呈現着許多糢糊的黑點。</p>
<p>暮色漸漸地深沉，把僅有的一綫微光也吞噬了。站立在船頭上，分不出天和水，看不淸遠和近；僅從水波摩擦船身的響聲上，意會着船與岸的距離，從江風的呼刮中，斷定前進的動向。</p>
<p>江面上的夜風，愈刮愈大，一陣一陣地橫掠過我們的船身；又掀起了速續不息的波浪，使我們的船身搖撼得更劇烈，船頭和給尾，顚簸起伏，打着江水，汨汨作響。</p>
<p>「江面上的夜風，竟也有這樣厲害，眞可算是大助！」兩個弟兄突然笑起來。</p>
<p>「哈哈！風愈大，我們愈起勁，天愈暗，我們也愈便利；上决麒麟河一仗，不也是在這樣的天氣和時間裏，殲滅了六百鬼子嗎？今天又是這樣的天氣和時間，哈哈哈！……」在後梢把舵的老强也笑起來說話。</p>
<p>「老强！給你一說，我的手又癢起來了。調回後方去休息了三個星期，就隔了三個星期沒聽到敵人的慘呼，我恨不得立刻跳過江去……。」</p>
<p>「划呀，快些！差不多近岸。別着急，豐富的收穫就在眼前！」他們的談話於是停止了，在寂靜裏，努力向前搖，飛快的，接近着大江北岸。</p>
<p>船和水的衝激，也漸漸地靜止了；夜色雖然深沉，但在黑暗中，也能望到一排長長的岸形。喜悅，然望，欣幸，堅毅，驟然充塞在各人的心中；緊張的情緒，鼓起了更大的勇敢。幾十隻船，像奪錦標似的，向江岸缺口處靠攏來。</p>
<p>「嘩——噓——隊長吹起了堅急口哨，一隊弟兄就迅速地攀登江岸。</p>
<p>前進！攻！火花在空中爆裂，火燄在草叢中燃燒，天空，山腰，田野，立刻漫散着許多紅的星粒。江岸附近的鬼營中似乎也出動了，槍彈，砲花，像流星似的飛射，縱橫交織地，佈滿了黑暗的天空。一隊渡過江的弟兄，就這樣勇毅地，划開腿，冒着敵人的砲火前進！</p>
<h3>回憶的手</h3>
<p>— 柳攸</p>
<p>耳邊，聽不見什麼，心裏想不到什麼，目前又是茫茫的一片。我祇有靜坐了下來，閉上了眼，嘴角邊皺出一個無故的微笑。</p>
<p>這時候，回憶的手伸出來了！牠飛了！又遠又高地飛。</p>
<p>啊！牠在飛，在我過來的道路上飛；牠很快地飛翔，尋覓着我的已往的事蹟，開始抓取！</p>
<p>昨日的辛酸，過去的快慰，被牠抓取了！</p>
<p>已往的罪惡，在昔的光榮，也被牠抓着了！</p>
<p>抓着了！什麼都抓着了！</p>
<p>可是，牠還向前飛，更高更遠，抓到了我的童年！</p>
<p>——住在古舊的故屋中，在故鄉的大地上嬉戲。</p>
<p>——一個無知的嬰孩，在母親懷中哭嚷着。</p>
<p>突然，牠飛回了，牠獻給我所抓着的，沒有半點兒遺留。</p>
<p>我感激地接受了！我很愛牠的禮物，我讚揚牠的功績。</p>
<p>我正在欣賞牠的賜予，忽然找到了無限的餘哀。</p>

<h3>雜說『好奇』</h3>
<p>— 蘇菲亞</p>
<p>『好奇，』—就如一個未到上海的人驚異上海的繁華而沉醉那樣。—在「君子」們底眼中雖然覺得有點「鄉曲」氣，然而在人的慾望中說來，這總是一種「追求」心的表現。</p>
<p>譬如吧，舊曆的新年到了，馬路邊又有賣月份牌美女畫的人，在一個靜僻點的空牆上，敲了幾個釘，張好了繩，於是就掛上了什麽人物洋畫，如蔣委員長玉照啦，林森主席玉照啦，再次就是裸體美女，以及畫得花花綠綠，然熱鬧鬧，上面是飛機飛艇，下面是輪船兵艦，中間是汽車等等的「風景晝」。這裹有上海大馬路外灘，以及美國的什麽，法國的什麽之類。蟭瞧這些畫得紙管熱鬧的東西，上等階級因為到過了，或是因為怕難堪，自然不高興劑到那一大堆滿滿的人中間去看個明白，但是却另有一批人看來怪起勁地談論着，眼睛出神地瞧着美國的大橋，嘴尖着偈個聽童話的孩子。</p>
<p>這樣是人們知道的，他們沒有看見過，在「好奇」。</p>
<p>自然啦，接着「好奇」之後，是像實地看一看的，但是他們的「福份」祇限於此了。到美國沒「福份」，就是進電影院也得算處，不得已，在這寒風的街頭，祇有來一個「書餅充飢」。至多，看來愛不釋手的，也不過慷慨地買牠回來，掛到自己家裏去點綴新年。</p>
<p>這樣慷概地買一張回去的人的舉動，也許是要被一般人所竊笑的，目為一個『曲死』，但是，愈是有這决心來買他回去的人，倒愈對新的東西追求得利害。這追求並不是可恥的。這「好奇」的動作倒正是反證這人的心中，極希望着一個新的將來。</p>
<p>『畫餅充飢』，雖屬無聊無益，然而至少是渴望這「餅」是眞的可吃呀！</p>
<p>如此的「好奇」情形，在中國只怕表現得最多；而這類的畫圖銷到農村裏去的遠勝於銷在都市裏。中國人的性格雖自稱是保守的，但由於鄉村中猶如此的渴望着新的一切，中國人的性格到並不保守的；反過來說，倘是這新的一切果眞是適於人類所需要的，那麽保守者也不會反對的。人究寬懂得好壞的呀。若是飛機可以轟炸平民，那麽，還是「保守一地說，這些東西不要吧。</p>
<p>中國是因為天災人禍弄得比世界進步的速率落後了，看着新的束西一件件地在別人家發明，自己感到的，祇有「好奇」，這由人進步的慾望的表現，是非常覺得悲劇性的。但願在這次民族的革新以，讓他們不再看着這塊牆上的「畫餅」垂涎吧。</p>
<p>讓他們也弄一塊眞餅嘗嘗！</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>『這里離開合浦鎭很近，×軍說不定會乘黑夜到這里來搜索，大家必須加倍留意，時時刻刻警覺着，槍要放在身邊，衣服千萬不可脫卸。」</p>
<p>她雖然這樣可囑，可是大家經過了一天的辛苦，此刻倒下頭來，早都沉酣地睡去了，就連那軍醫處長也不能例外，甚至還有人發出很響亮的鼾聲來。只有方慧一人不敢入睡，她張開了眼，望着黑暗裹，並且側耳傾聽外面的聲息。</p>
<p>半夜裏，外面忽然發出了一陣很急促的狗呌聲，接着又有兩三處的狗呌了起來。方慧正朦朦朧朧的要睡去，聽了這聲昔，睡意不知飛到那里去了，疾忙跳起身，把耳朶伏在泥地上細聽。外面除了狗呌聲外，還隱的有皮靴聲，又好像有隻狗被踢了一脚，發出慘厲的哀鳴。她悄悄把門打開了一扇，只見外面手電筒的光閃閃爍爍的，有幾條黑影在光後面蠕動，冷不防那光直向她射來，她的全身便全無掩蔽的顯露在光裏了。三個面目猙獰的×軍，迎着她走來，當先的一個執着盒子砲，後面的兩個把三八式步槍放平，作着瞄準的姿勢。</p>
<p>這眞是非常危急緊張的局面，方慧的身邊並沒有武器，要回身進內去取已來不及，倘若她的身體動一動，那麼彈丸立刻就可以打中她身上。她深知當前的情勢已不容她趨避，憑着她平時卓越的膽識，索性一動不動的挺立在那他們面前，看他們作什麼舉動。</p>
<p>那三個×軍走到離方慧的五碼處，便立住了脚步，常先執着盒子砲的一個，居然會說中國話，操着流利的上海白，涎着險向方慧呌：</p>
<p>『嘰！姑娘。』</p>
<p>『做什麼？』方慧惟恐露出了破綻，假意裝做恐怖的模樣。</p>
<p>『姑娘，我給你看一樣好末事。」那×軍一面說，一而仲手到懷裹去掏，掏出一張照片來，借着手電筒的光，向方慧揚了一揚，很得意的說：『這是我的妻千代子，你看她美不美？漂亮不漂亮？』</p>
<p>方慧其實沒有看淸，但她故意讚不絕口的說：</p>
<p>『果然很美，很漂亮！你有這樣美麗漂亮的妻，為什麽不厮守在家裏，過快樂幸福的日子？反而拋下了她，遠遠跑到我們中國來？』</p>
<p>『沒有法子呀！』那×軍似乎被方慧的話所感動，說話時的樣子不勝欷歔了。</p>
<p>方慧又故意問：</p>
<p>『現在你們跑到這里來，打算作什麼？』</p>
<p>那×軍又恢復了原來嘻皮涎臉的樣子，把身體凑近一步說：（三六）</p>

<h3>談國際賭博</h3>
<p>— 佛</p>
<p>捷克亡了！德國的軍隊，巳浩浩蕩藩殺進捷克京城去了，哈嘉總統牽羊肉袒，巳向希特勒獻了「投降書」，民洽陣錢國家養育的這個兒子，可憐夭折，不知作若何感想。說者謂，慕尼黑協定，紙墨未乾，希特勒先生面孔巳變，得寸進尺，貪得無厭，未免太不够交情了，其實此種局勢，全係張伯倫先生一手所造成，而捷克的滅亡，還不是最後的一幕，而眞正的好戲，還在其後。</p>
<p>我不懂國家的策略，與國際的形勢，我祇曉得打牌，打牌祇有一個順逆，倘然鬥錯一只脾，牌便要奄下去，或挺了三六九筒，或一四七萬不和，反被挺了邊張或嵌張的和了去，此種霉頭，眞是觸釗印度國。蘇台德區的牌，張伯倫先生當碰而不碰，被希特勒頭家吃了一張嵌張，便連和了三付，何等寫意，三連必有東，說不定還要和付三台辣子，也未可知，眞是一只偶差，全局俱敗。</p>
<p>歐美人士，不大打麻雀，而善鬭撲克，前日美國參議院外交委昌會主席華德曼，向報界談話『謂希特勒誠歐洲各國鬭撲克牌的「國手」，各國手中之牌，均較德國所持者為優，竟乃為德國所勝。』這話確是不差，反之，民治陣綫的國家，鬭撲克的本領，太覺繁脚，假定希特勒偷機，你們定要看看，希特勒一定會失敗，現在希特勒第一决偷機勝利，本錢既粗，胆氣亦壯，第二决偷機，他人自不敢看，第二次偷機勝利，第三第四决偷機，他人更不敢看了，於是希特勒便為無敵的「撲克國手」。</p>
<p>四人打牌，兩人吃瘟，希特勒和墨索里尼，還在抬轎子，我放你一只中風，你放我一只白板，你想和三番，我想和淸一色，弄得其餘二家，目定口呆，沒法擺布，張伯倫先生雖覺打錯了牌，但到了現在，牌情逾弄逾糟，本錢逾弄逾小。已是無法挽救，雖譴責希特勒擾亂大局，亦屬徒然，許多的籌碼，早被希特勒先生撈進去了。德義兩國，自稱為歐洲軸心，一個向陸路上發展，一個向水道上轉念頭，一搭一擋，一吹一唱，弄得各國手忙脚亂，無法應付，不是等於打牌抬轎子麼？到現在的情形之下，而和平陣綫的國家，還不覺悟，不肯澈底團結，所謂「阿元戴帽子，一定要完。」</p>
<h3>關於河北四存中學</h3>
<p>— 廷美</p>
<p>十三日本埠各報，全以顯著地位，載着冀四存中學與日軍作殊死戰的消息，由於這壯烈的事蹟，四存中學這陌生的名字才在人們的腦膜上烙上了深刻的印象，筆者會在四存執過敎鞭，為了加强我們抗戰的力量，寫一點關於四存中學的歷史，讓大家知道這壯烈的事蹟是並不是偶然得來的，同時也可以證明敎育對於國家，社會所有的責任，至巨且大了。</p>
<p>四存中學先前只是博野鄉下的一座小學，幾問土坯屋子，繞着籬牆：後由鄉紳張蔭梧氏斥資擴充，始更今名，由小學而中學，至七七戰幕揭啟時，校舍已靑樓連雲，學子亦近千矣！</p>
<p>四存之名，源淵於淸儒顏李學派。我在幼年，祖父曾吸着旱烟，晒着太陽，給我講過顏習齋的故事。他說：顏習齋是本邑大儒，家奇貧，三歲時，父親給韃子兵——按即滿洲兵——擄去，母親也改嫁了，他在鄰家乞食賸飯殘湯，有時在田裏幫人去苗拔草，到二十多歲的時候，他知道父親是給韃子兵擄去的，就决心出關尋父。但適値兵慌馬亂，一年一年的，所以直到五十多歲，他才出了關，顚連困苦，經過幾年的辛酸歲月，他才把父親的骨頭背回來葬到祖塋裏了。</p>
<p>顏習齋於治學方面，反宋儒空疏之弊，力倡實用之學。謂：「人之歲月精神有限，誦讀中度一日，便習行中錯一日，紙墨上多一分，便身世上少一分。」故其著書甚少，今常為人道者，僅「存學」，「存治」，「存人」，「存性」，四篇。</p>
<p>四存中學之名，很顯然的是基於此的。既批崇顏氏之學，故該校精神，樸實堅苦，躬行實踐，實非外人所可意想其萬一。張蔭梧氏深感近代靑年，浮囂矜持，耻回農村，故以四存倡導，力革斯弊，全校師長，咸以犧牲精神，從事敎育；志高行潔，堪為靑年楷校，學生不僅有軍訓課目；日常生活，實無不紀律化，軍事化，制服為土布，夏褐冬黑，繃腿紮腰，素好以國之干城自命。</p>
<p>余離四存，雖已九年，然當日情况，猶如昨日，號角一聲，開始了整日的工作，至夜深人靜時，號角聲父把全校送入夢鄉。我們的生活，無時不在緊張中，圖書館裏，埋頭研究，變做了書　；農塲裏澆水施肥，與農夫無異；到野外就又騎馬試劍，儼然是斬將塞旗的武士了。</p>
<p>在這抗戰緊急關頭，該校師生本其一貫之身體力行精神，將素來所習者，見諸實踐，以赤誠熱心，獻之國家，我還記得從前在校中最流行的歌，有這樣的字句：「……好男兒頭顱正，好男兒性命輕，大好男兒死在沙塲受令名……」現在該校師生是死在沙塲了，雖不是為了什麽生前死後名！</p>

<h3>「孤兒樂園」觀感</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>美國尼柏拉斯加省奥馬哈地方有一個別有洞天的小城市，這世界上最安靜最有意義的一角，是在孩子們的管理和工作下成功了一個非常明潔的小政府，那裹有二百七十五個公民，最大的十八歲，最小的只有六歲。二百個是男的，七十五個是女的。—那個小城市就是Boys　Town，是法蘭納根神父慘澹經營了二十一年的孤兒樂園。（見亞洲影訊）</p>
<p>「孤兒樂園」就是描述法蘭納根為那些孤苦無吿的孩子奮鬭的歷史。飾演法蘭納根神父的是去年榮膺藝術院獎章的史本塞屈賽，飾「與匪為伍，兇悍倔强」的懷德的是和史本塞屈賽合演「怒海餘生」的米蓋雜納。由於這兩位優秀演員的合作，和通過了導演者瑙鬥泰勒底卓越的藝術手腕，使「孤兒樂園」底內容和形式都達到了藝術的最高峯。</p>
<p>現把各方面的略分述如下</p>
<p>（一）演員：史本塞屈賽的法蘭納根神父—他從在牢獄中聽了一個臨刑的死囚的懺悔起，就堅决以敎導兒童為己任。他向各方捐款，收容兒童，建造房屋，感化懷德，受社會抨擊，而終於眞相大白，他的事業成功。史本塞屈賽都能從他冷靜的而部表情上透露了艱苦卓絕的精神，允其是感化懷德，比威的幾塲戲，演得更深刻，感動。米蓋羅納的懷德—他不但把一個倔强，毫不在乎的壤孩子演得淋漓盡致，（如：初决遇見法蘭納根神父時，故意含了捲烟，架了腿，活現出一付流氓孩子的神氣；進園後，領導他參觀各個工作室情形時，也是浮躁，滿不在乎的樣子。）而同時在比威被汽車碾傷後，他的純潔的天良發現，他聽了全院兒童的祈告，茫茫然信步大街間，及最後推舉他為樂園市長時，那欲哭無淚的情狀，而終於撲到神父的懷中，眞可以說是「感人沁脾」，使銀慕下的觀衆把他過去的劣行一掃而光，反而覺得他的天眞，可愛了。「世界上沒有一個壞孩子，」他的演技是更强有力地證明了法蘭納根神父的信念。飾比威的Bobs　Watson，也是不可多得的童星。</p>
<p>（二）導演：瑙門泰勒的圓熟的手法也證明了一寓敎育於娛樂」並不是一句口號。「孤兒樂園」雖然也是一部歷史電影，但他並不放縱不必要的橫的發展，他是緊緊地抓住了主錢，，去蕪存菁，一貫地發展下來，而且活潑而自然。如那個大衛的安揷，借款那塲戲是太可愛了，以一個鋼錶和一偭玩具作為一百元的抵押品，然而當神父說便每一個孩子都成將來良好的市民的話以後，就解决了這問題。全片情緒氣氛的把握，導演者更顯示了他的魄力。如開始時，法蘭納根會見臨刑的死囚那塲，幾個死囚和法蘭納根的特寫，都非常有力。更可愛的是懷德决心逃走，比威堅欲偕行，一直到匪徒搶刦銀行那塲戲，從輕快的情緒中跌到悲哀的深淵，再跳起來展開緊張的塲面，導演者是緊緊地拉着觀衆的心，幾乎使人喘不過氣來。其他畫面編識的簡潔，允是餘事。</p>
<p>看完了「孤兒樂園」，實在太使人感動了。「世界上沒有一個壞孩子」，但是世界的每一個角落裏，都在剝蝕兒童純潔的天良，使他們墮入不可救藥的環境中去，而感到像「孤兒樂園」那樣的工作是非常逼切的了。現在，上海正有關心兒童福利的人士，在注意這一工作，那就是「上海兒童保育會」，上星期的本刋登過一篇特寫，在一年多的努力下，它們已經樹立了很堅固的基礎，希望該會工作人員的更努力，更希望各界能予以物質，精神的援助，使它能有擴大到全中國，全世界，「使每個孩子都成將來良好的市民」。</p>

<p>第六回　誇人瑞一苗挺三秀　敘友情二士會羣英</p>
<p>何儷玉這：『眞的！從火車上下來，在車站上，我們見了一位髣髴似警官模樣的人，他還向你舉手為禮咧。以後我們從車站到石湖，再從石湖送君素姊到東吳大學，又從東吳大學出發，一路行來，也不會見一個警察呢。』朱愛人道：『剛纔在車站上所見的那位警察，是姓方，他是專派在車站上的。每决火車到，有什麼特別的客，或是外國人到蘇州來游歷的，他都要記起來，有的還耍報吿上級。說起那位姓方的警察來，還有一件珍聞，而且講給你們聽，更有意思。』何雙玉道：『到底是什麽珍聞呢？為什麼講給我們聽，却是更有意思呢？』朱愛人笑道：『慢慢地讓我來講給你們聽呀！我是在開車，你不要催促我呀。原來那位方警官，也是本地人，他住的地方，和我們的醫院，相距僅不過二三里之遙。他的夫人有孕了，預先到我們醫院裏來掛了號，也來查騐過身體。預備到臨產的時候，然後住到醫院裏來。可是到了臨盆期已過了，還不生產，而她的肚子，叉特別地大。連走路都不好走，我們用車子把她接到醫院裹來了。大家加以研究，我的義母老章醫師，說一定是個雙胞胎。因為她的肚子太大了，而且是個頭生，要非常當心。老章醫師父吩咐我要親自收生，這時那個方警官，聽得說要難產，急得不得了，因為他們的伉儷是很篤的。一直到了十個月又一星期，方始產生了，果然是難產。幸虧我們預先都　防備好了，還不至於有所失錯。及至產生時，不出老章醫師所料，生了一個，又是一個。我們以為是雙胞胎了，誰知產生了兩個以後，裏面還有一個，一連產生了三個。而且這三個都是男的，一時弄得兩個助產小姐，看護小姐，手忙脚亂起來。因為雙胞胎原是預備好的，三胞胎却不會預備好的。幸喜我們醫院裏人多，連老章醫師也親來帮忙。那時不但鬨動了全醫院，也鬨動了全市鎮。老章醫師說：『我們醫院裹，變胞胎是常有，不足為奇。三胞胎却是少有的，我們要好好的護養他們。從產婦以至嬰兒，都要盡心看護。』（六三）</p>

<h3>憶夏月珊之愛國思想</h3>
<p>— 孫雪泥</p>
<p>不侫酷嗜戲劇，尤好名山歷遊，吳，越，魯，燕，皖，鄂，閩，粵，以及日本，南洋，所至必以該地戲劇為入境問俗之旨，雖不完全了解，亦足以心領神會。蓋戲劇能代表一地之文化精神，而富有藝術的趣味，其轉栘風俗之力量，固不在宗敎宣傳之下也。二十年前，不佞主持春柳，始識薛壽齡，壽齡為堯卿丈之文郞，時新舞臺已遷九畝地，過從旣久，因識夏月珊氏，觀其風度，不類伶界中人，聽其言論，允足多者，因追憶記之。（一）有國家思想　夏氏富於愛國思想，新舞台自十六舖遷至九畝地，全以振興華界市面為宗甲，九畝地本來人口無多，自開明公司建築舞台店面以及開明里後，居戶日增，市容為之一變。當時猶以為未足，曾有東亞大劇塲之計劃，預備建築費一百二十萬兀由某工程師設計，四圍花園泉石之勝，舞台之搆造，允為特殊，面積絕鉅，可以應付背景，座位寬大舒服，視綫與燈光，處處合理化，對於聲浪因四週花園可與外界隔絕，其設想不可謂不新。惜夏氏身先作古，未竟其志，即以新茶花一劇而論，亦富於國防意味，其提倡戲劇之苦心，引起觀者發生愛國之與味，是誠未可厚非也。</p>
<p>（二）有社會意義　總觀夏氏一生，如提高伶人人格之伶界聯合會，有關公益之救火會，志在敎育之榛苓學校，及菁莪體育會，在在對於社會有益，不僅以藝術為能事。黑籍寃魂一劇，曾轟動一時，而其苦口婆心，令人可佩，常時有忌之者，於開演此劇之際，投彈二决，亦未輟演，其百折不撓之精神，洵屬難得。</p>
<p>（三）有革命立塲　明末遺恨，徽欽二帝，俱係夏氏編導之劇本，寫亡國之慘痛，與波蘭亡國慘有異曲同工之妙。新舞台在十六舖時代，經理室中時有革命先烈之過從，滿淸末葉，曾上書攝政王，歷述伶人之應平等待遇，不能列娼優為一途，其理直氣壯，大聲疾呼，眞難能可貴。</p>
<p>（四）有道德觀念　夏氏自奉甚儉，而待人不薄，濟公活佛雖係神話，然不外勸善之旨，對於世俗痛下針砭，有傳神阿堵之長，惜繼起無人，遂成絕唱。全本天雷報為老譚所擊節嘆服，餘子碌碌，更無論矣。考天雷報亦寓勸善懲惡之意，所謂生公說法，頑石點頭，其他舊劇，如陰陽河，梅龍鎭，黃鶴樓，獨木關，等亦有獨到之處。至改良新劇，係過渡時代每有扞格之虞，不能以非驢非馬數典忘祖相責難。總之夏氏不特有功於戲劇，且有功於社會，影響於國家甚深。惟其子小珊，從事電氣，留學歐洲，歸國後不能繼續父業，發揚光大其偉大之思想，以竟其未竟之志，為可惜耳！</p>

<h3>龍頭與拖車</h3>
<p>初進舞塲的人，聽見了「龍頭」「拖車」等名詞，未免要透着駭異，旣不是鐵路和車站，那裏來的龍頭與拖車呢。原來能頭是指舞女而言的，但並不是個個舞女都有道種稱呼，龍頭與拖車是相對的名詞，掛上了拖車，便稱龍頭，不掛拖車，豈不成為光幹龍頭，那便不稱龍頭了。</p>
<p>然則拖車又是一件什麼東西呢？此中人語曰。凡舞女與舞客落了相好在舞客方面，謂之接龍頭，這舞客就成為拖車了，有了拖車資格的舞客，可就麻煩大啦，因為舞女並不是與某一舞塲訂有終身合同的。而且茶舞夜舞午餐舞，又大都不在同一塲所應市，所以凡是和舞女落了相好的舞客，彷彿在法律上規定了一種隨駕捧塲的義務，今天舞女在東家做，舞客就得跟到東家去捧塲，明天在西家做，又得跟到西家去捧塲；如此一來，道舞女也就好像火車上的龍頭，這舞客自然像掛在龍頭上的一輛拖車了。</p>
<p>還有一層很微妙的解釋，火車龍頭的馬力越大，拖車也可以掛得越多，舞女龍頭的魔力越大，拖車也可以越掛得多，一個龍頭，如果能掛上幾十輛拖車，舞票就可以源源而來，她的身份也就彷彿舞今工一個紅角兒，大小舞塲，爭相邀聘，職員僕歐，侍應維周，你看又多麽威風呢。</p>
<p>還有一層，一個龍頭，能够同時拖幾十輛拖　。一輛拖車，却不能同時接幾十個龍頭，這也與火車實際情形，很有些彷彿相似的。你說當拖車的寃是不寃，但是仔細想來，當龍頭的，也是父母生養淸白身體，又何嘗不寃呢。</p>
<p>再講拖車之中，名目亦甚繁多，不過這類名目，就未免有些牽强附會，大凡王孫公子，西裝筆挺，汽車簇新，天天有一班淸客朋友，捧進捧出，至於鈔票舞票，那更予取予求，不必說了。掛上了此種拖車，旣占面子，又得實惠，名為藍鋼車，這是她們同行中所認為榮耀的。决如富紳巨賈，年事雖高，手面尙稱闊綽，皮氣也還不甚難弄，坐汽車買衣料等差事，也還辦得不錯，此為頭二等車。若商行小夥，買票不過三五元，取現稱是，倘然來個鄉頭，靴免推三捱四，還要今天也糾纏，明天也隨駕，眞如雞肋一般，食之無味，棄之可惜，那就以破鈔多寡之分，定為三四等車了。還有一種大學生，年紀輕，西裝挺，彷彿是兩件長處，洋錢少，皮氣壞，又彷彿是兩件短處，再耍講起眞愛情來，眞使人受不了，此種戶頭，祇可偶一利用，不能靠他營生，她們就稱謂黃包車。還有一種硬漢，有錢有勢，胆敢帶了另一相識，光降到龍頭的所在地去，龍頭還不敢不忍氣吞聲，與之周旋敷衍，這呌做鐵甲車。又有一種人，用錢說多不多，塲面說小不小，態度作為，說漂亮也好算漂亮，性情皮氣，說溫存也好算溫存，弗冷弗熱，好比一碗溫吞水，取名呌馬車，大概是因為弗快弗慢的綠故吧，最壞一種，名呌糞車，因為拖着了這種車，要絕對守着秘密，倘若宣揚出去，就雞免臭聲四溢再也沒有客人來光顧了，若要跟他家去，他又養不活她，眞是啞子吃黃連，說不出的苦，然而舞塲中拖糞車的，還小是絕對沒有，諒來總有別種好處，我也是道聽塗說，胡寫一陣罷了。</p>
<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一二三）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>諸葛亮斬馬謖時帶審李七</p>
<p>審李七」這齣戲，從前是黃潤甫的絕唱，以後郝壽臣也以此劇享名一時，每决夾滬總以李七長亭相號召，李七·長亭·就是說前段是審問李七的罪惡，後段長亭，注重王良求情。這齣戲還有個別名呌作」用鐐，演這戲的角兒，首先須把江洋大盜的舉動，言語等揣摹得相像，其次才能講到唱·作唸·白·這些部分。壽臣自命是黃三的傳人，所以演米也很有可取的地方，他期滿返平後，上海人都極力讚揚他奏演的佳妙，幾乎有人說這齣鐵除去郝壽臣外，南北的淨行裏就沒有第二個人能唱啦。這句話偏偏傳到金少山耳裹，他一睹氣馬上呌行頭店裹替他作了一身罪衣，（紅色襖袴，也有用紅綾作成單衣的。）定打一副鐐銬，等到一切預備齊全啦，又把道戲練了一練，即擇好　個日期，正式在大舞台出演了。他因為要與壽臣較一日短長，所以演時異常賣力，居然捧的人很多，也有說眞比壽臣好的，也有說不如壽臣熟鍊的。這兩人扮演此劇，我都曾看過，的確是各有所長，無分軒輊，可是除他二人以外，現存的淨角中就沒見別人貼演了。以上所談的是「審李七」一齣戲，與下面所叙述的「審李七」可完全不同了。從前北平戲班裏有位唱花面的李壽山，人極長大，因此同行裹就給他送個外號，呌大個李七，後來因四個字不好呌，遂就簡稱曰大李七，不知底細的人，還當他是大李五（李順亭）的胞弟，其實那可擰啦。他原與李鑫甫（李庫）是昆仲，這與大李五是絕不相干的。鑫甫演戲極守規矩，能耐又好，雖說是一生浚走紅運，常隨老譚等充硬裹子，然而內行人確非常賞識他。至於他這位寳貝兄弟大李七，可與他逈然不同了，他對於生·旦·浄·丑·樣樣都要唱。我曾見他同蘭芳配奇雙會　的李奇，（生）同尙小雲配「風箏誤」的醜丫頭，（彩旦　同小樓配「戰宛城」的曹操，（淨）最可笑的就是李七也常好貼演「審李七，一的確還很為觀衆所推許，居然與他那齣風箏誤一的丫頭，同稱為他的雙絕。現在有位賈多才，倘與小雲配丫頭，就是摩仿李七一派，並且博得台下熱烈歡迎。所以李七雖是淨行，而他死後所享名的，却是在彩旦這一行上，這也可算一件稀奇的事兒呢。</p>

<h3>首飾金連小兩次</h3>

<h3>中歐局勢杌隉　英美匯兌連跌三日</h3>
<p>本埠匯市遂亦英平美緊</p>
<p>滙市因中歐局勢杌隉、德又併捷、英美問互滙驟告猛跌、昨又各小二厘半、（查已連跌三天共小八厘一至八一二五、）致局勢遂告英平美緊、中途英滙、雖洋行略有結款、但以銀行頗肯供給、故爲狀殊平、然美滙則因操業者均看英美滙兌、有續疲之勢、故銀行界賣意淡薄、加以港電突來猛扒、致雖有天津投機商一度前來拋塞、但以頭寸終屬扒過於售、致潛勢卒告步軟、至港匯因外行與華行等頻塞不已、故爲狀反趨鬆動、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠仍平、紐約銀價亦仍呆定、倫敦生金續長半便士、匯兌英對美縮二厘半、對法降三生丁、對滬未更、美對英跌二五、對法小二五、對滬縮五分、中央掛牌各滙如舊、銀行晨開賣價英滙八便士二五、美滙十六元〇九三七五、較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、開後洋行雖來扒結、但以銀行供意尚佳、故未受影響、洋行結進匯豐英匯八便士二五、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉、亦無升降、仍徵百分之八·五〇、此後雖天津投機家傾向賣出、無如銀行趁賤則扒、故爲狀依然乏變、天津幫塞予有利荷蘭美滙十六元一二五、將近午時、外行華義與華行相繼賣予洋行港滙五十五元三七五、爲狀略硬、午收銀行賣價英匯八便士二五、美匯十六元〇九三七五、與晨開無異、</p>
<p>後市洋行又來扒進匯豐·有利英滙八便士二五、繼之外電香港突來猛吸美匯、故爲狀略軟、港電結進荷蘭·華比某行美滙由十六元〇九三七五、縮至〇六二五、最後外行安達與華行賣予洋行港匯五十五元二五與三七五、於是潛勢漸平、迨晚收銀行賣價、英匯八便士二五、美匯十六元〇六二五、結果較之前收、英平美緊〇三一二五、港滙則反長一二五、</p>

<h3>證券　又傳將發新公債　市塲所受影響甚微</h3>
<p>行市一度紊亂旋即回平遠東英商股票驟告猛落</p>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市況、因政府擬發行新公債十二萬萬元、市塲頓起無謂之紛擾、並有利用之而壓小行市、希圖乘低吸收、故初開行市、極爲紊亂、戊種開價衹四十九元二角、丙種開價五十元〇七角、相差有半元之多、嗣後驟即回上、按此種公債之發行、聞以其一部份爲中交行五百萬英鎊準備、餘爲開發西北之用、完全爲生產事業之需要、傳聞如此、尚待證實、惟此種公債、與市塲流動之統一各債無關、乃可斷言、且新公債之發行、無形對於舊公債加一層保障、但市塲浮多太多、故易起波瀾、經此一番淘汰後、散戶浮多、大都均已斬割了結、大戶多頭則堅壁清野、屹然不動、前之做空者、今反而做多、故前途因當有轉變趨勢之象、昨日經過、上午開盤、元大首先壓小行市、喊價紛亂、天生號及三十五號乘低奮勇吸收、戊種頓時回上一元、雖德孚同康及十五號賣出而承康貿大潤利等仍有吸收、價乃漸漸立定、上午小六八角、午後形勢安定、大豐號轉空爲多、協大永康以及五十二號均有買進、雖德孚及十一號仍有出籠、市塲已逐漸趨堅、回上四五角形勢已定、當有轉風、市價結果略小三四角而已、成交總數共計約七八十萬元之譜、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>紗花　現紗市塲　變成帽子交易</h3>
<p>市價之不能振作其原因亦在於此</p>
<p>紗市稍形回起、但漲勢極其迂緩、蓋以客銷依然清閑而無起色、市塲成交、仍以同業買來去之交易占多數、完全一種抱搶帽子主義、如能獲利一二元則甩出、所以市上人頭聚集異常興旺、然查其實際之生意、寥寥無幾、就此情況推測下去、勢必存貨愈積愈厚、日久現稍不起、深恐終難脫離需要腳地而趨上漲也、午後雲南汕頭兩幫採辦稍勁、市氣又緊、根本問題、仍在實銷上着想也、不過成交仍以同行占百分之五十以上、</p>
<p>現紗情況、晨初開盤依舊散漫無勁、二十支雙馬做三百九十二元、與上日無甚軒輊、但旋有某號在市搜羅十交支紗、湖南幫稍有三二支細紗綫生意、人氣略爲激昂一步、帶好一元、最後二十支雙馬紗價爲三百九十三元半、棧單價爲三百九十一元半、午後人氣稍昂、以南方一帶稍有需要而堅、雙馬現貨未有做開、棧單價爲三百九十二元、結果全日各幫買去統計一千四百七十包、行情平均漲一元至三元、惟細紗綫價漲力愈強、廠方由安達廠開出十支飛虎一百二十包、價爲二百八十九元半、天津幫去、今日尚有棉紗二百五十件運福州、又二百八十件運汕頭、二十五件運香港、茲將各幫口買去之額量列左</p>
<p>同行　八五〇　厦門　二〇　內地　一一五</p>
<p>（香港）二〇　汕頭　一〇五　湖南　五〇</p>
<p>溫州　二五　四川　三五　寗波　一〇</p>
<p>（天津）一二〇　雲南　一二〇</p>
<p>統計　一、四七〇</p>
<p>日紗市面、繼續上升、蓋以十六支紗銷路暢盛、北路買胃甚強也、於是影響到二十支紗亦帶上升、二十支水月現貨價爲三百三十八元、二十支藍鳳現貨價爲三百三十元至二十九元云、</p>
<h3>通州花再漲一元</h3>
<p>高峯價達七十九元美棉跌價成交略旺</p>
<p>本棉生意尚稱不弱、但比上日爲少、因其價繼漲增高、且貨物甚少、廠方無從下手、以致成交減縮、然通州花又見高峯、價爲七十九元、比上日漲一元、海火機花亦續昂七角半、在此鍾有漲無跌之下、廠方何能着手、然來源無望、市價殊難鬆懈、故中外各廠一律購訂外棉、以資補救、照此情況推測下去、購買外棉正在方興未艾之中、本日日廠進天津棉三百件、裕豐購美棉一千件、申新亦進美棉四百五十件、碼頭到貨、計下沙細絨花四百六十六包、茲將現棉情形錄左、</p>

<p>司屈郎米特令　九〇·七五　裕豐廠進　一、〇〇件　現鈔棧交</p>
<h3>十六分之十五</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、因盛傳美政府之貸款棉即將放出、獎勵出口、並發給運棉出口之棉花津貼、以便與世界棉市相競爭、故各同業深信貸款棉確有放出之必要、棉市轉呈疲軟之狀、利物浦電告下落、現貨商賣出及南方套賣頗烈、因之近期及現貨價猛跌十磅音、印度連同預測跌二羅比、埃及跌二十餘磅音、折合法幣、棉價俱跌、計美棉及巴西棉每担跌八角、印棉跌七角、埃及棉跌一元一角、</p>
<p>滬市外棉交易、因紐約跌價、美棉略有成交、計申新進阿根廷五百包、合送廠價爲九十一元、又進印棉一〇八件價七十六元、利泰進巴西棉五百包、價七十四元、日廠方面計上海廠進巴西棉一千件豐田進美棉五百件、公大及內外廠各五百件、餘廠均無交易聞、茲將昨日棉價分列於後、</p>

<h3>疋頭　漂煉廠出品慢緩　夏令貨售盤愈俏</h3>
<p>國布春夏令淺色布疋、以本埠漂煉整理廠最大規模新創之三家尚未能開工、致工作中之十餘廠在此本外埠春銷接踵而來之時期、即有顧此失彼之虞、坯布湧塞、而製成品各種大路貨、如府綢漂布洋紗絲光淺色布之類出品慢緩、客幫現需頗難呼應、故市氣殊形緊張、售盤先後提漲、尤以紗素府綢上身襯衫及素府綢爲最昂、浙贛幫去路仍占大宗、粵幫採辦色斜二千餘疋、色布府綢二十餘箱、富貴等牌細布細斜五六十包、溫甬幫辦白貨細布需要較濃、續成交各牌一百餘包、粗布細斜粗斜五十包之譜、售盤略定、津幫採辦府綢藍布漂布等貨一百數十箱、本街染廠辦下檔細斜一百餘包、</p>
<p>東布因連日色布·色斜走銷旺盛、本街各染廠需要坯布繼續不斷、故細布細斜售盤漸堅、以本街銷納爲最大出路、昨日訂開又達千件之譜、青島天津客幫衹進細布三百餘包、東棉行開出十一磅藍日細布及龍頭寶貝細斜共三四百件、藍日細布售價爲每疋十一元二角半、龍頭細斜下月份爲十一元七角、本月份十一元六角半、寶貝細斜十一元三角半云、</p>
<p>今日有疋頭一千四百件運天津、一百二十件運烟台、三百八十件運汕頭、二十件運香港、</p>
<h3>糧食　常錫等產地　有停發搬運證說</h3>
<p>本市杜粳銷路呆洋客尖日商問津</p>
<p>杜粳　昨日各幫來源河下共到十一號、車運包子一二千包、到貨忽稀、聞常錫等地自本月十五號起、某方停發搬運證所致、而售方心思遂堅、扳持極力、乃銷塲方面、反因呆木、故各貨大都未能做開、市面呈定中帶軟之局、若厚粳有定有小一二角者、薄稻有降角外者、杜洋尖埠失及變元供求相仿、無所榮辱、</p>
<p>客秈　昨本客消化仍活、行囤趁低吸收外、零戶納胃尤香、且有日商問津、故統市交易又開至四千包以上、行情站定、不被河下粳尖所影響、高米更呈穩定、南京秈開十二元七八角、蕪湖秈十二元五六角、中次照別不一、</p>

<h3>如何赴西南</h3>
<p>— 寳</p>
<p>照目下的情形，要由上海到西南去，可以走下面的幾條路：</p>
<p>（一）自上海乘船至寗波，然後坐小汽船至溪口，再乘公路汽車到金華，改乘浙贛粵漢湘桂三路火軍經南昌株州衡陽等地，就可以到桂林，轉往西南各地。</p>
<p>（二）自上海先乘船到溫州，然後乘船至靑田，再乘車經溫溪而達麗水，由麗水坐公路汽車至金華也可以。</p>
<p>（三）自上海到法屬海防，改乘滇越鐵路，就可以到昆明。要是往廣西去，則於到海防後，先到河內，然後由公路經過鎭南關逕入桂省。</p>
<p>（四）先乘船到香港，然後改乘輪船到海防也可，改乘港河綫飛機到河內亦可。</p>
<h3>海防至昆明滇越車情形</h3>
<p>— 景</p>
<p>從海防到昆明有中法合辦的滇越鐵路，直駛其間，旅客稱便。該路工程，甚為偉大，就是沿途較大的山洞，竟有一百六十餘個，由此可見一般了。但是該路的路軌較狹，載客載貨的數量，亦因此而較小。由防至滇，分為普通及特快車二種，現在分別簡述於後一、普通車每日由海防乘火車至河內，此段每日有快慢車各五班，祗需二小時可達。第二日上午九時二十分由河內開，當日下午七點十一分到老街，第三日上午六點二十二分由老街開，當日下午六點零七分至開遠，第四日上午六點三十六分由開遠開，當日下午四點四十七分就可到昆明。搭坐普通車者，車上並無臥舖設備，都耍旅客自己在沿途各地找尋旅館，好在河內，老街，開遠等地，都骨國人設立的旅館，亦無十分不便利之處。</p>
<p>二、特快車每星期僅有二决，日期為星期二，五，先由海防　車至河內，當日下午八點三十分，由河內乘快車至庸買，此段火車，係在夜間行駛，車上備有臥舖，但僅頭二等有臥鋪設備，三等則無。頭等分甲乙兩種，甲種每位越幣六元，乙種每位四元五角，二等每位三元。第二日上午五點三十九分到了庸買後，就要改乘米許林快車，所謂米許林車者，與公共汽車相倣，有橡皮輪十二只，循路軌行駛，駛行頗速，但車座頗少。星期三由庸買開出者，僅有頭等座十五位·星期五由庸買開出者，僅有頭等十八位，三等十九位，旅客應於出發前預在海防登記，否則不能得坐。該車於上午六時十九分由庸買開，同日下午六點四十二分即可抵達昆明矣。乘坐米許林車每人僅可携帶行李十五公斤，而免費准帶之行李，仍為三十公斤，可於出發前一二日，交普通車運出。</p>
<p>車票票價，因該鐵路為國內段與越南段二段的幣制各異，所以頗難計算，現在依照最近的滙兌率，仲合國幣計算，其票價職下：</p>
<p>頭等　約國幣一四九·〇〇元，二等的一〇四·六三元，三等約五四·六元。</p>
<p>（曾通車與特快車之價目相同）</p>
<p>關於其他詳細情形，尙請隨時向中國旅行社詢問。</p>

<h3>Counteroffensive by Jin South Chinese Army for Days; Japanese Troops in Wanquan and Linjin Completely Cleared; Fierce Fighting Between Pinglu and Pianguan, Chinese Army Recaptures Lougou Fort; Japanese Troops Completely Eliminated in Dawu Town, Surrounded on Three Sides of Lishi; Repeated Attempts by Japanese Troops in Central Hubei to Cross the Xiang River at Lundu are Repelled</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Xi'an Telegram: The Jin Chinese army has been counterattacking for days, and the war situation has stabilized. Most of the Japanese troops near Wanquan, Linjin, and other places in southwestern Shanxi have been cleared. Shenchi was invaded, and the Chinese army is counterattacking. Fierce fighting has continued for days between Pinglu and Pianguan, and the Chinese side has recaptured Lougou Fort, and fighting continues. Lishi is surrounded on three sides by the Chinese army, and nearby Lijiawan and Hejiaqiao have been recovered. The Japanese troops near Dawu Town have been completely eliminated. The Chinese army in northern Henan is counterattacking Jiyuan, and the Japanese troops are trying to repair the railway, but the Chinese side is sabotaging it with guerrillas, making it difficult to repair. Twenty to thirty Japanese planes have arrived in Hainan Island, with their main force still in Haikou. Japanese troops who landed at Pingfeng in northern Jiangxi have been severely attacked by the Chinese army, suffering heavy casualties. (Seventeenth Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Yu Telegram: According to reports, the Chinese army in southwestern Shanxi has been attacking Japanese troops in recent days, and has approached Wenxi and Xiaxian. The Tongpu Railway has been repeatedly damaged by the Chinese army. Japanese troops advancing from Anze to Fenyuan in eastern Shanxi were intercepted by the Chinese army at Dayang Village Jiaokou River and have made no progress, suffering four to five hundred casualties in the past two or three days. Only three to four hundred Japanese troops invaded Jiyuan in northern Henan, and the Chinese army is attacking on three sides, making it easy to eliminate them. After the Chinese army in eastern Shandong captured Zhaoyuan, they continued to attack the Japanese troops near Qixia. Japanese troops in Guangdong plan to increase three divisions to attack the southern route. Japanese troops attacking Qianshan from Conghua have been defeated. (Seventeenth Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) There were no major battles on the battlefields on the 16th. According to the observations of a senior military expert, considering the overall situation of the Japanese troops in various locations, they are still unable to launch a large-scale offensive in the short term. This is because the Japanese troops do not have enough troops to allocate, and they have no way to replenish them. Therefore, they have been focusing on consolidating the occupied areas. In Shayang, central Hubei, the Chinese and Japanese armies are still shelling each other across the Xiang River. The Japanese troops currently occupy the area east of the river and Jiukou, with a total of two thousand men. The Japanese troops in Yangzi, Zhongxiang, are adopting a defensive posture. The three thousand Japanese troops in Xihe are urgently trying to attack westward, and the Chinese side has taken strict precautions. Although the Japanese troops in northern Jiangxi are trying to attack Nanchang, the Chinese army has deployed heavy troops and it is extremely difficult for them to succeed. Japanese troops who landed in Duchang, Poyang Lake, have been annihilated by the Chinese army. Xiangbei is quiet. (Seventeenth Special Telegram)</p>
<p>Hequ: The reason for the decisive defeat of the Japanese troops invading northwestern Shanxi: 1. The Chinese army implemented a scorched earth policy, which was quite effective. 2. The Japanese troops lacked support, and all the troops numbered only three thousand, with more than a thousand killed or wounded, resulting in a disastrous defeat. The morale of the Chinese side has been boosted after this victory. (Fifteenth Telegram)</p>
<p>Hequ: The Chinese army recaptured Jiaokou, located four kilometers south of Lishi City, killing more than four hundred Japanese soldiers, including four Japanese officers, and countless wounded. They captured more than 70,000 rounds of ammunition, more than 100 rifles, seven light machine guns, two pistols, telephones, telescopes, gas masks, and other items. (Seventeenth Telegram)</p>
<p>Yicheng: Japanese troops in central Hubei have repeatedly attempted to cross the Xiang River, but all have failed. Yesterday, more than two hundred Japanese soldiers secretly crossed the river at Yuekou Xisi Port to Zhangjiachang, but were discovered by the Chinese army, and half were defeated and half were annihilated. Japanese troops in Luohansi Street transported forty canvas boats from Jiukou and forcibly requisitioned civilian boats in the surrounding area, attempting to cross the river. This morning, they were spotted by the Chinese army and shelled, hitting key areas. Japanese troops in Wujiaji, west of Jiukou, set fire to Chinese civilian houses. More than a thousand Japanese soldiers in Wamiaoji, including a small number of cavalry, were active in the Nanheji Taipingdian area yesterday. Japanese troops on the front line of Suixian launched a probing attack on the Chinese side yesterday, but were repelled by Chinese guerrillas. (Seventeenth Telegram)</p>

(Seventeenth Express News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, Cai Tingkai, a famous Chinese anti-Japanese general, has now taken office as the deputy commander of the Eighth Army Group, summoning the old troops of the Nineteenth Route Army to fight in Guangdong Province, taking the lead. Elite Chinese troops are now entering Guangdong Province from Guangxi and Guizhou according to a predetermined plan. It is expected that a major battle will occur again, and the Chinese army will annihilate the Japanese troops in Guangdong Province and recover the lost territories. (Seventeenth Express News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Chinese sources, the Japanese troops in Beijiang have been continuously reinforced in recent days, appearing to be preparing to attack north again. There was fierce fighting near Guanzhuang, Huaxian, yesterday, and the situation on the east and west rivers has become quiet again. (Seventeenth Express News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Commemorating the "March 18th" Incident</h3>
<p>Today is the 13th anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre in Beijing. The Tiananmen massacre was a scene in which Japan, through the so-called ruling government of China, slaughtered revolutionary civilians in Beijing to carry out its insidious plot of "using Chinese to control Chinese." At that time, although the Chinese revolutionary movement was widespread, it failed to mobilize the vast masses of peasants and workers to participate in the subjective aspect, and the revolutionary forces were extremely fragile. In the objective aspect, the so-called ruling government had the support of Japan, and the forces to suppress the revolution were quite strong. Therefore, this revolutionary movement was finally suppressed. However, the lesson of this bloodshed has sown the seeds of resistance and national construction. Today, in order to fight for survival and freedom, they have united to resist Japanese aggression. Now that the war has entered the second stage, the Japanese army in China has fallen into a dilemma, and the domestic economy cannot bear the huge war expenses. Therefore, it is more actively carrying out its insidious plot of "using Chinese to control Chinese," extensively buying off local bullies, ruffians, and bandits, in the hope of strengthening the puppet regime and dispersing China's resistance strength, so as to achieve its aggressive goals. Under these circumstances, China has once again come to the anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre, and learning from the past is of profound significance.</p>
<p>The Tiananmen massacre occurred against such a political background: In 1924, after the Fengzhi War, the Feng warlords, Japan's tools, took the opportunity to enter the customs and extend their influence in North China and Central China. The expansion of the Feng warlords' territory was actually the extension of Japan's power in China. In October of the following year, Zhejiang warlord Sun Chuanfang organized the Five-Province Allied Army of Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Jiangxi to launch an anti-Feng war. At that time, it was after the May Thirtieth Movement, and the Chinese people clearly realized that the Feng warlords were Japan's tools for suppressing the revolutionary movement. Therefore, Sun Chuanfang took advantage of the masses' anti-Feng sentiment to call for opposition to the Feng warlords' oppression of the patriotic movement. Under this call, he gained the sympathy and assistance of some of the masses. Therefore, the Allied Army not only won consecutive victories, but also influenced some of the Feng warlords to tend towards anti-Feng. Guo Songling's defection arose from this. The Feng warlords were about to collapse rapidly. Japan saw that its tools were about to lose their effectiveness, so it directly helped, eliminated Guo Songling's armed forces, and relieved him of his worries.</p>
<p>In the anti-Feng war, the Chinese people took advantage of this opportunity to expand the revolutionary movement day by day. On the other hand, it also influenced some advanced soldiers, causing them to turn to the ranks of the revolution. The National Army led by General Feng Yuxiang turned over at this time. Because this armed force was close to the masses and had the support of the masses, its strength also expanded day by day, and soon occupied Pingjin, Hebei, Chahar, Suiyuan, Henan, and other places.</p>
<p>The occupation of the revolutionary forces dealt a considerable blow to Japan's invasion of China. Therefore, it further called for the alliance of Zhi and Feng, providing the Zhi faction with huge sums and the Feng faction with arms, ammunition, and military talent, in order to eliminate the National Army. On the other hand, it also supported the Zhilu Allied Army led by Li Jinglin and Zhang Zongchang to attack the National Army in Hebei. In March 1926, the National Army repeatedly defeated the Zhilu Allied Army in Jinan, greatly boosting its prestige. The Japanese fleet bombarded Dagu Fort, colluding with the Feng fleet to attack Tianjin, in order to support Zhang and Li, and used the serious ultimatum of the diplomatic corps to exert pressure. However, the Chinese people resolutely refused to compromise, resolutely opposing the Japanese fleet's bombardment of Dagu and the alliance of Zhi and Feng. The people of Beijing specially convened a national assembly on the 18th to petition the ruling government. However, the ruling government at that time carried out Japan's instructions, opening fire on the petitioning masses, creating the Tiananmen massacre.</p>
<p>From these facts, in the past, Japan in China repeatedly supported reactionary forces and came forward to打击 the revolutionary forces in order to achieve its aggressive aims. Therefore, this war of resistance in China, in a historical sense, is not only settling the bloody accounts after the "September 18th" or "July 7th" Incident, but is settling the bloody accounts accumulated in history. Now that the War of Resistance has entered the second stage, the Chinese people see that the Japanese military has no way, actively using the means of killing civilians in the past to strengthen the puppet regime, intensifying its insidious plot of "using Chinese to control Chinese." To commemorate the 13th anniversary of this massacre is of greater significance. Only by advancing along the bloody path of the martyrs of "March 18th," in addition to military mobilization, can we engage in political mobilization to crush all of Japan's sinister plots and strive for independence and freedom!</p>

President Roosevelt recently spoke with Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Committee (who was originally opposed), and decided to raise it again. (Sixteenth Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Walsh, Chairman of the Senate Naval Committee, told people today after a White House meeting that President Roosevelt intended to resubmit the bill for $5 million in funding for the development of the harbor in Guam. It is said that the President does not oppose the deletion of the Guam defense plan from the naval and air base bill, but may suggest that it be submitted to Congress at a later date in a bill requesting funds to develop various rivers and harbors, and that the $5 million for developing the Guam harbor be included in it.

<p>(Moscow) It has now been confirmed that the Soviet authorities have held a tender for fishing grounds in Vladivostok, and Japanese fisheries did not participate. There are a total of 293 fishing grounds, and the results of the tender for four of them have recently been announced, all of which were won by the Soviet Fisheries Company. The remaining 289 will be tendered again in two weeks. During this period, the Soviet Union and Japan may reach a compromise, and it is not impossible for Japanese fisheries to participate in the tender. Local officials recently stated that the Soviet authorities only want to take back 40 of the fishing grounds that Japan has been operating, and do not intend to take further measures. (Sixteenth Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A Foreign Ministry spokesman recently stated that Tokyo has received official information stating that the Soviet government unilaterally held an auction of fishing areas in Vladivostok on the 15th of this month, but has not received information about the results of the auction. Therefore, it is not known whether the Japanese fishing areas that have always been exempt from auction have now been auctioned. It is said that the Foreign Ministry is waiting for detailed information on the results of the auction before deciding on future steps. (Seventeenth Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) It is said that the number of Japanese troops stationed in "Manchukuo" has increased, but political figures here do not attach too much importance to it. (Sixteenth Havas Telegram) According to foreign sources in this port, reliable foreign military reports indicate that new troops from Japan to "Manchukuo" and Korea have been continuously transferred to the Soviet-Manchu border within a week. The number of troops reaches as many as 40,000. The Japanese side recently suddenly ordered that all merchant ships, except for Japanese military transport vessels, are not allowed to enter Rajin Port in Korea near Zhanggufeng. The passenger transport has been completely disrupted due to frequent military transport. Separate news, four or five days ago, two Japanese divisions, about 40,000 men, landed in Kuye Bird, which is divided into two parts, half belonging to the Soviet Union and half belonging to Japan. According to foreign military experts, the Japanese troops in Korea and "Manchukuo" are usually transferred in March every year. About 40,000 to 50,000 troops originally stationed in Korea and "Manchukuo" are transferred back to the country every year. However, according to foreign reports received here, the Japanese troops originally in Korea and "Manchukuo" do not seem to be preparing to return to the country in large numbers. It can be seen that the purpose of the newly arrived troops is to strengthen the garrison strength in Korea and "Manchukuo," and at least until the Soviet-Japanese fishing dispute is resolved, the troops there will not be reduced.</p>
<h3>Sichuan-Xikang Inspection Team Prepares to Depart; Work Plan Drafted; No Acceptance of Any Supplies</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Sichuan-Xikang Construction Inspection Team is about to depart, and reporters interviewed the team leader to inquire about everything. According to the team spokesperson, (1) the departure date of the team has been decided. All groups, except for the eastern Sichuan and northern Sichuan routes, which will depart from Chongqing to inspect the counties nearby, will all depart from Chongqing by car to Chengdu on the morning of the 18th. They will not stop along the way and will stay in the province for only two or three days. They will then depart from the province separately according to the original routes of each group to inspect the counties. (2) The work plan of the inspection team has been drafted and is very detailed. Various survey forms have also been prepared for use, in order to provide accurate materials on the various administrative situations, construction overviews, and the hardships of the people in Sichuan and Xikang provinces, so as to formulate concrete plans for the construction of Sichuan and Xikang. (3) When the team departs to various counties, it will not accept any welcoming or supplies from any party. The restrictions on the words and deeds of the inspectors themselves are also very strict. Therefore, it is hoped that all agencies, organizations, or individuals will not hold banquets to entertain them. The team has collectively decided not to attend any banquets. (4) Various departments of the central government have assigned personnel to depart with the various groups of the team to assist in the inspection. However, due to traffic restrictions, the team resolved at a meeting on the 15th of this month that it would no longer accept other participating assistant personnel from now on. (5) The team's inspection of various counties in Sichuan and Xikang is only for two months, at most no more than seventy days, and the round trip of each group is more than five thousand Chinese miles. The team is very concerned that a long journey might make the inspection inadequate, which would be contrary to the original intention. Therefore, the team sincerely hopes that people from all walks of life will allow it to hope that the gentry in all counties can provide more assistance, notify in writing or immediately provide face-to-face consultation based on what they have seen and learned, which the team members eagerly anticipate.

<h3>From Hangzhou-Fu to Southern Anhui, a Frontline Inspection Report: The Japanese Army Employs Bluffing as a Cautious Tactic; Chinese Forces Will Inflict a Fatal Blow</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Over the past ten days, our reporter has traveled from the Hangzhou-Fu frontline to the southern Anhui frontline, compiling the following report based on integrated information from both the Japanese and Chinese sides: A. The Japanese army between Hangzhou and Fu maintains a force of approximately 2,000 to 3,000 soldiers, with minimal fluctuations. The Japanese have claimed to be constructing permanent fortifications along the lakes and hills between Wukang, Yuhang, and Fuyang. However, there has been no activity for over a month. From a distance, the reporter observed very few sentries at the Fuyang Japanese fortresses, and the situation remains unchanged, suggesting a mere bluff. There is more activity of the Japanese army between Jiaxing and Haining, reportedly a mixed brigade, intending to eliminate the Chinese guerrillas along the coast. There have been repeated encounters in recent days. B. Along the west bank of Tai Lake and the river to Wuhu, the two divisions of the Japanese army have concentrated their main forces in the suburbs of Shanghai and Wuhu-Wanzhi area. In case of emergency, they will utilize railways and highways to quickly transport troops. According to confirmed reports, the Japanese forces at various strongholds around Tai Lake range from two to three hundred to as few as forty or fifty soldiers. Besides day and night patrols, there are no aggressive actions. The large basin shaped like a bow, extending from the northwest of Tai Lake to the Yangtze River, is one of the weakest links in the Japanese defenses. Judging from the recent panicky situation within the puppet organizations, the Japanese are feeling increasingly challenged in their defense. C. In northern Jiangsu, a Japanese force of one and a half divisions is applying heavy pressure, advancing southward along the Longhai Railway in three routes, urgently seeking to break through the Huai River line to facilitate rapid transportation. Currently, the Chinese forces, after retreating eastward from Hanshui and Huaiyin, have reorganized into smaller units for comprehensive mobile surprise attacks. The area around Funing, Yancheng, and Dongtai will become the new focus of the war in northern Jiangsu. However, the Japanese offensive has weakened recently. D. Across the river from Anqing at D渡口 (D渡口), the Japanese army has slightly increased its presence. Japanese gunboats have been patrolling the river surface between 大流 (Daliu) and 香口 (Xiangkou) rigorously. On the dawn of the 3rd of this month, around three hundred Japanese and puppet troops attacked the second district of Dongliu. After being intercepted and defeated by the Chinese self-defense forces, the area has calmed down. Wangjiang city on the north bank of the Yangtze River, since its recapture on the 6th, has not been challenged by the Japanese army. There are no traces of the Japanese army in Shou County and Fengtai, and the local order has slightly stabilized. The Japanese claim to treat the eastern battlefield as an economic and political war zone. The Japanese and puppet newspapers repeatedly spread false peace rhetoric. Their intention is clearly to deceive the Chinese people with false peace, relaxing the Chinese side's will to fight. They are also infatuated with the abundant resources of the Tai Lake basin, striving to avoid direct battles to facilitate their predatory schemes. The Chinese side has initiated comprehensive countermeasures to inflict a fatal blow to the Japanese army. (16th dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Daily News Commentary: Austria and Czechoslovakia Were Conquered Due to a Policy of Non-Resistance</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Central Daily News editorial stated that the conquest of Austria and Czechoslovakia was the result of adopting a policy of non-resistance. Overseas events have proven that the Chinese government's determination to resist Japanese aggression with arms is the correct policy. Although Abyssinia is weak, it is still fighting. Austria and Czechoslovakia, however, did not offer any resistance, and within a day, they ceased to be independent nations. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Former Commander of the Sixteenth Army, Fan Shisheng, Assassinated: Suffered Sniper Attack While Practicing Medicine in Yunnan; Perpetrators, Two Brothers, Arrested; Motive for Assassination Possibly a Vendetta</h3>
<p>(Kunming) Fan Shisheng, former commander of the Sixteenth Army, returned to Yunnan last year and resided at No. 1 Pu Cao Tian (蒲草田). He hung up his shingle and practiced medicine. At 4:30 PM on the 17th, while riding a rickshaw to the front of the First Health Experiment Institute at the foot of the South City Wall, he was suddenly attacked by two assassins with handguns. Fan was hit by several bullets and immediately fell to the ground, dying on the spot. The rickshaw puller was also seriously injured. The assailants were arrested and identified as brothers Yang Weixiang (楊維襄) and Yang Weiqian (楊維騫). It is rumored that their father, Yang Zhen (楊蓁), was once Fan's chief of staff and was shot by Fan's troops. This assassination may have been motivated by revenge. (Dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<h3>Financial Conference Concludes: President Kong Delivers Closing Remarks</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) President Kong's closing remarks at the local financial conference on the 15th were as follows: "The Ministry of Finance convened this local financial conference. During the short five-day session, everyone was able to concentrate, report in detail, and discuss with precision. Moreover, during the review and discussion, you were all able to contribute your insights gained from experience and knowledge, as well as strategies for the benefit of the nation and society. This is of great significance. Today, the Supreme Leader instructed us that during the war of resistance, there are three essential tasks: first, military affairs; second, education; and third, the economy. The economy is closely related to finance, and finance is the mother of all undertakings. Without finance, everything is empty talk and impossible to realize. Therefore, to maintain the source of finance, we must develop the economy, and consolidating finance and seeking its development are of utmost importance. You are all from various regions, either in charge of local finance or managing local financial institutions. Your responsibilities are very significant. In this extraordinary period, being able to gather together and jointly discuss various major plans to contribute to the nation, so as to achieve the goal of winning the war of resistance and building the nation, is a rare opportunity. Throughout one's life, regardless of its length, one always hopes to fulfill one's responsibilities to the nation and make some contributions to society. The legacy of ancient sages and worthies, the so-called establishing virtue, establishing merit, and establishing words, carries the same meaning. Now, under the current situation of all-out resistance to seek survival and independence, people across the country are united in their efforts to save the nation. Looking back at our nation's history, whenever there has been foreign aggression, there have been examples of unity in resisting the enemy. However, never has there been such a gathering of national strength, united and resolute in confronting the enemy. We believe that after this war of resistance, we have shattered the enemy's dream of unifying East Asia, giving the enemy a profound lesson. From now on, the enemy will no longer dare to underestimate us. Our awakening this time is just like gold being refined in high heat, removing the impurities. From then on, we will break away from the status of a colony and forever become a first-class nation in the world. Our financial conference is convened during this epoch-making period, and its significance is self-evident. If we want to contribute to the nation and society, and establish a lasting reputation, now is a rare and valuable opportunity. There will probably never be such a great opportunity again. Recently, many people have criticized the government's meeting habits, saying that they 'meet but don't discuss, discuss but don't decide, decide but don't act, and act without strength.' This is probably because in general meetings, participants like to make proposals, and there are too many proposals to discuss in a short time. So, they have no choice but to send them to the government for review. Our conference may not have many proposals, but they are greatly related to the war of resistance, nation-building, and the revitalization of the nation. This can be said to be a historical conference, and its important nature is different from ordinary meetings. After detailed research and discussion, we have decided on a very good plan, which must be implemented one by one and never shelved. I hope that everyone understands the greatness of their responsibilities and missions. After returning to your local areas, follow the plan and put it into practice, correcting the past problems. This morning, the Supreme Leader instructed that finance has made great contributions to the country through various measures in the past. Our military strength is indeed inferior to others, but our financial system and economic organization are what the enemy fears. Although the enemy has tried every means to undermine our finance and destroy our economy, they have wasted their efforts and achieved nothing. Now, our legal currency (fapi) credit, even after a long period of war, is still very solid. Even internationally, it has gained extraordinary status and reputation. The report of the HSBC shareholders' meeting and the speech of British Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon have all praised the credibility of our legal currency. Not only is this the attitude of a third party, but even the scholars and experts on the enemy's side have to admit this fact in their treatises. From this, we can see that China's currency system and finance have gained a considerable position internationally. However, the acquisition of this achievement and reputation is by no means due to luck or accident, but the result of the hard work and efforts of many people in the past. This precious achievement is of great benefit to the war of resistance, nation-building, and the revitalization of the nation. We must not only maintain this situation, but also promote and expand it. Therefore, we still need to make painstaking efforts and continue to work hard in the future. Since this conference has a detailed plan, we must promote it step by step. In addition, we must unite and cooperate, and there must be an overall plan and an overall organization. We must not act independently and without principles. I have attended the education conference and told the participants that education is the mother of the nation. Our education in the future should cultivate talents who meet the following four conditions: (1) have a noble personality; (2) have a sound physique; (3) have applicable skills; and (4) have a spirit of cooperation. This is not only what education should do, but also what you should do in training talents in the future. In the past, on the one hand, the talents who graduated from schools felt that they had nothing to do, and on the other hand, the society felt that there were no talents available. The graduates of schools did not meet the needs of the society, and the society could not accommodate these talents. This is the shortcoming of education in the past. In the future, the financial sector should reward, cultivate, and promote talents who have the above four conditions. This is also a very important task for the financial sector in the future. Recently, transportation is not very convenient, and you all have your own tasks and cannot stay here for a long time. Therefore, this conference will end today. I hope that everyone can follow the plan of this conference, unite sincerely, implement it in all aspects, and select and explore talents who can help themselves and provide them with appropriate training. Helping oneself is helping the country. What I have said today is not without value for your reference. I hope you will make extra efforts and hope that this war can defeat the enemy and end soon. Under the Three Principles of the People, we will build China, not only to revitalize the Chinese nation, but also to achieve the supreme goal of the world being for all. (16th dispatch)"</p>

<p>Prague: German leader Hitler quietly left the Czech capital yesterday evening. The people of the Czech capital are united in their hatred of the German invasion, so there were no grand ceremonies when he left the capital. The Czech Jing (京) Daily declared that Germany's ambition to expand its territory is still not satisfied. According to eyewitnesses, members of the Sturmabteilung (SA) went to the Czech National Bank this afternoon and transported away sixteen cars of gold reserves. German secret police cut off the escape routes of Czech political fugitives and arrested many people. Hundreds of foreigners are also in a dilemma as a result. Since the implementation of anti-Semitism here, many Jews have committed suicide. (Associated Press on the 17th)</p>

Each household and shop has been ordered by the German military commander to fly flags. Several German planes have been circling at low altitude since morning.

<h3>British and French Public Opinion Turns Increasingly Hardline Against Germany: Condemning Hitler as Despicable and Shameful, Advocating Strengthening Capabilities</h3>
<p>(London) A Reuters diplomatic correspondent stated that after the Czech incident, British public opinion has gradually hardened. This trend can be seen in the sudden changes in the tone of The Times and the Daily Mail. Among British newspapers, these two newspapers have always advocated a rational solution to Germany. However, The Times now condemns the activities of the German secret police in the Czech capital as appalling and contrary to the behavior of civilized countries. The Daily Mail also stated, "Hitler's attitude towards the world is despicable and shameful." "Our security depends on our military strength." (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Newspaper commentary here has gradually become more hardline and direct. Le Journal de Paris expresses deep disgust at Germany's tyranny, calling the Germans a people of lies and plunder, regarding any oath as nothing. France has no other way than to prepare with threats. (Reuters dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Times, in a commentary titled "Military Action," stated, "Hitler's annexation of Bohemia and Moravia is nothing less than a blatant announcement to the world that Germany's future policies will not be guaranteed by morality in any way. The destruction of Bohemia and Moravia has no defense or plausible excuse to hide behind. On the contrary, the German leader himself has gone further and completely violated his promises. Since the National Socialist Party came to power, German policy has gradually become public, and the general public can better understand its content. In short, there is no room for moral debate on this brutal act of oppression. However, the German government does not conceal it, and its propaganda department continues to use its traditional tactics, making all kinds of base and general lies. Who believes that the efforts and military gains of this week can survive by luck? Except for the National Socialist Party, Germans, we believe, are questioning whether violating the firm lessons of history can make Germany more solid. Finally, we believe that time will always determine everything. Whether this week is a bright start for the new Czech leaders, we will wait and see." (Associated Press dispatch on the 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, the government has gradually become indignant at Hitler's recent actions, because the British government has repeatedly expressed trust in Hitler's guarantees, but now Hitler has gone back on his word. 克明斯 (Kemins) declared in the "News Chronicle" that Chamberlain's optimistic tone last weekend was not consulted with the Foreign Office, so the Foreign Office was very panicked about what he said. At that time, the government was sleeping sweetly, but now it must quickly rebuild a hardline foreign policy on the ruins of the appeasement policy to avoid the expulsion of Chamberlain.

<h3>Hitler's Whereabouts</h3>

<h3>Slovakia Has Become a German Protectorate: Poland Is Panicked and Uneasy, Surrounded by Germany on Two Sides</h3>
<p>Warsaw: The news that Hitler has placed Slovakia under his protection has caused panic here, because Poland hoped that Slovakia, which Poland recognized yesterday, would be independent, at least politically, even if not economically. Poland is now surrounded by Germany on two sides. Now that Slovakia has entered the German customs area, Poland's only direct non-German trade route to the Danube River basin has also been blocked.

<p>Bratislava: After Slovak Prime Minister 蒂梭 (Tiso) requested protection from Germany, Leader Hitler granted his request, and German troops began to occupy various border areas of Slovakia. The government office in 马拉基 (Malaki) had a dispute with the German military authorities, which was quickly resolved. Similar incidents have occurred in other places, but they are not of major nature. The head of the Slovak propaganda department recently gave a speech to the press, stating that German troops are occupying the borders of the country based on the following four reasons: (1) The border line between Moravia Province and Slovakia Province, which was drawn in 1921, is only temporary. (2) Hungarian terrorists are threatening the security of the country. (3) The Czech troops in Carpathian Ruthenia Province and the Ukrainian military groups have a tense relationship, which may endanger the country. (4) The internal situation of the country has not yet reached stability. (Havas dispatch on the 16th)</p>

<h3>Alas! Ha加达 (Hajada)'s Words: Voluntarily Destroying the Country: Violent Oppression</h3>
<p>Prague: President Ha加达 (Hajada) announced a book to the Czech people over radio last night, saying: "The worries I had 20 years ago have unfortunately come true. The solution for the nation that my colleagues thought of in the past has only become a page in our national history. This has been proven after experiencing many changes. As for the cause of the changes, who should be responsible for it and who should share the blame, there is no need to state it now. Leave it to future generations to judge fairly. The urgent task is to maintain a bright and calm attitude, accept the current changes, and realize that we must have a serious responsibility, that is, do our best to hand over this precious heritage to future generations. After the change occurred, I maintained until the last moment, and with the consent of the government ministers, I personally visited German leader Hitler, and with the courtesy of the leader, I discussed the situation thoroughly with Hitler for a long time and decided to announce that the Czech nation and its national destiny would be entrusted to Hitler, and gave him complete trust. Hitler also promised to protect the existence of our people and promised that our people would enjoy autonomy. Now he has fulfilled his promise and issued an order to place Bohemia and Moravia under German protection. From now on, the survival of our people will be guaranteed, and our lives will also be developed in accordance with the unique national character... Thanks to the power of Hitler, Germany has now become the largest country determining the fate of Central Europe. Our nation is now united with that country, thus restoring the relationship with the Holy Roman Empire. Hitler also told me that if the Czech people need German assistance in their lives, Germany will not hesitate to help. Now we must not fail the expectations of the leader of the great German nation. Although the leader trusts our people very much, I will do my best to protect the interests of our people, and if necessary, I will not hesitate to adopt the most severe methods to deal with it. I hope that our people can enjoy a peaceful and prosperous life under the new legal status and have great development." (Havas dispatch on the 17th)</p>

<p>From Bucharest, Romania: Carpatho-Ukrainian Prime Minister Volosin, after seeking refuge in Romania, has proposed to the Romanian government that it take over the province. The Romanian cabinet held a meeting this afternoon to discuss the matter. It is reported that the cabinet members are unwilling to accept this proposal because the province has already been completely occupied by Hungarian troops. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>From Warsaw: After Hungarian troops entered the Carpatho-Ukrainian province, their advance units, led by Colonel Bleid, reached the Polish border at 3:30 PM today, at the Dukla Pass. They met the Polish border guards led by Colonel Spychalski. The two military commanders then held a friendly gathering in the town of Khemique, with a very warm atmosphere. The Polish people were overjoyed to learn that Poland and Hungary now shared a border. When Speaker of the Senate, Mr. Medhingski, officially announced this news in the Senate this afternoon, all the senators stood up and cheered, "Long live Hungary!" At 8:00 PM in the evening, over two thousand people held a gathering near the Hungarian embassy to celebrate. The Hungarian ambassador appeared on the balcony and gave a speech, saying, "Now that Poland and Hungary share a border, the relations between the two countries will surely become stronger." He concluded by shouting, "Long live Poland!" The crowd responded with "Long live Hungary!" They then marched through the streets, singing patriotic songs. In addition, news from the border reports that Czech refugees are continuously fleeing into Poland. Some Czech soldiers have also fled to the border, where Polish border guards immediately disarmed them. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>(London) During today's House of Commons debate on the naval budget, former First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr. Duff Cooper, stated that the value of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement, and any agreements signed with Germany, is highly questionable. He stated that the head of Germany is a habitual oath-breaker and traitor, and therefore, any agreement signed by the German leader is not worth the paper it is written on. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

The report by the French news agency yesterday that the Lithuanian Foreign Minister is already in Berlin to discuss the Memel issue with German officials is unfounded. However, after the Foreign Minister arrives here the day after tomorrow, he will naturally visit the German Foreign Ministry. (17th)</p>

<h3>British Parliament Discusses Naval Budget: 200 Ships to Be Built This Year; Existing Fleet Can Challenge Any Combined Fleet; Tactics for Detecting and Sinking Submarines Also Superior to Other Countries</h3>
<p>(London) The Parliamentary Secretary to the Admiralty, Mr. Shakespeare, presented the naval budget to the House of Commons today, totaling £149,000,000, exceeding last year's record peacetime budget by £23,000,000. Mr. Shakespeare stated that no less than £61,000,000 of this total will be used for ships planned in 1939 and previous years, and for repair work on existing fleets. During the current fiscal year, the navy added 43 new warships, and another 60 warships will be added to the fleet in 1939. Members will surely feel the magnitude of the 1939 shipbuilding program, which includes: (1) Two high-speed battleships, each 40,000 tons, with 16-inch guns; (2) Four cruisers for protecting commerce; (3) One giant aircraft carrier; (4) Two destroyer flotillas; (5) Twenty new-style high-speed escort ships, each equipped with weapons to resist submarines and aircraft. Shipyards across the country will be engaged in building 200 warships this year, totaling 870,000 tons. This is a national plan for defense efforts, unprecedented in peacetime, exceeding the tonnage completed annually in the years before the last Great War by 30%. 220,000 tons will be completed within one year, compared to an average of 170,000 tons in the years 1912-1914. If we compare the construction work of one ton in the past with one ton today, battleships are three times larger and destroyers are six and a half times larger than before, because the design is more complex, the protection is more comprehensive, and the gun positions are more important. As an example, the cost of managing the gears of the battleship HMS George V, launched in 1912, was £11,000, while the cost of the gears of the recently launched battleship with the same name has increased to £213,000. The increase in construction work is not limited to shipbuilding. In the past three years, the construction work of heavy artillery has increased twentyfold, medium artillery fivefold, and light artillery eightfold. As for mines, torpedoes, depth charges, shells, and fuses, there are now sufficient supplies for at least one year of war. When Mr. Shakespeare spoke of the program to resist submarines and aircraft, members paid close attention. Mr. Shakespeare said that the danger of submarines is often exaggerated, forgetting that a total of 16,500 ships were sunk by enemy submarines in the last Great War, of which only 102 were sunk while being escorted by warships. After the escort method was adopted in 1917, the harm of submarines was greatly reduced. As a result of close cooperation between the Admiralty and shipbuilding industry leaders over the past two years, it can now be stated that Britain will be able to implement an escort organization on any route it deems necessary immediately after the outbreak of war. Sufficient anti-submarine guns have been stored to meet all expected needs. More than 9,000 merchant seamen have now learned transportation protection methods and gunnery. Appropriate weapons and equipment, available for the majority of merchant ships, have been stocked so that they can be distributed to each ship to resist submarines once war breaks out. Since the last Great War, science has made great progress in resisting submarine warfare. He certainly cannot announce the nature and extent of this progress, but he believes that Britain's methods of detecting, searching, and sinking submarines are superior to any country in the world. He had participated in the experiment of searching for the location of submarines, and the results were very good. Experts say that in suitable environments, the location of submarines can be detected with no doubt in nine out of ten cases, which is very credible. Mr. Shakespeare also mentioned the success of the "Niehong" patrol method in the Mediterranean, saying that this is clear proof that those driving submarines dare not ignore the British ships that can sink submarines in a certain area. Mr. Shakespeare also spoke of air raids, saying that the policy of the Admiralty is to install the latest anti-aircraft guns on warships, and the number of these anti-aircraft guns has now increased by 75%. The difficulty of air raids on warships with anti-aircraft guns and attacks on undefended merchant ships cannot be compared. This can be seen from recent events at sea in Spain. Moreover, in addition to anti-aircraft guns, there are also naval aircraft and the cooperation of the Imperial Air Force. Regarding the escort of armed self-defense merchant ships, when they enter narrow seas and approach the coast of their own country, the Imperial Air Force will provide very close cooperation. In general, the Admiralty is confident that the British Navy today is very strong and can accept the challenge of any combined enemy fleet. Mr. Shakespeare also spoke of the procedures for transferring naval aircraft from the command of the Imperial Air Force to the Navy and the recruitment of naval soldiers, saying that the recruitment results last year were very good. Since 1938, about 18,000 officers and soldiers have joined the Navy, selected from 70,000 applicants. The six new aircraft carriers will not be able to join the fleet until 1940. The required aircraft have already been ordered and are actively being constructed. The number of naval air force personnel has increased from 3,000 in 1938 to 6,000, and is expected to increase to 10,000 in 1942. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Britain Being Forced Out of the Yangtze River: Statement from the Admiralty</h3>
<p>(London) During today's House of Commons debate on the naval budget, the Admiralty spokesman, Mr. Lewellyn, concluded the debate by stating the naval position in the Far East, saying, "It is not true that Britain has been driven out of the Yangtze River. We are all aware of the various difficulties there, but of the fourteen gunboats permanently stationed on the Yangtze River, six have already returned to Shanghai, and eight are still stationed upstream. This situation is quite normal, as a certain number of gunboats are always stationed in Shanghai for repairs, etc." Regarding the reopening of the Yangtze River, Mr. Lewellyn replied that this matter belongs to diplomacy, but Britain still has gunboats stationed on the Yangtze River.

<h3>French Cabinet Passes Bill to Strengthen National Power: Large-Scale Preparations to Be Made; Submitted to Parliament for Discussion Today</h3>
<p>(Paris) After the State Council meeting held by the Cabinet at 10:00 AM today, a communiqué was issued stating, "Premier Daladier and Foreign Minister Bonnet presented reports on the international situation separately, and read out the draft statement that the government intends to issue to Parliament, which was passed by the meeting. Premier Daladier then submitted a bill, advocating that the government be given the necessary powers to consolidate and strengthen France's power. This bill was also unanimously passed by the State Council and will be submitted to the National Assembly for discussion tomorrow." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Well-informed sources have announced that Premier Daladier is scheduled to submit a bill on political, economic, and military powers to the State Council tomorrow, and then submit it to the National Assembly for discussion on the 18th. The main points are as follows: (1) The government may mobilize various industries related to national defense and maximize their production efficiency. The current 40-hour work week may also be changed. (2) When necessary, the government may requisition national defense-related factories and their workers as much as possible. (3) The implementation methods of the mobilization system may be revised to give it greater flexibility. (4) The term of the National Assembly (scheduled to expire in May 1940) may be extended by two years to avoid holding elections in the midst of unstable international conditions. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<h3>Switzerland Anxious</h3>
<p>From Bern, Switzerland: After Germany's changes in Central Europe, Switzerland is quite uneasy. All newspapers commented with anxious tones, criticizing Germany for disregarding the right of small countries to self-determination and for not keeping its promises. One newspaper stated that the most serious blow suffered by Switzerland was the shakeup of the trust that promises should have. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3>Italy Increases Troops in North Africa Again: Is It Planning to Take Advantage of the Situation? Britain Asks for an Explanation</h3>
<p>(London) In the wake of the dramatic changes in Central Europe, Italy has again increased the number of troops stationed in its North African colony of Libya. Regarding this matter, the British Ambassador to Italy, Lord Perth, has been instructed to express his regret to Italian Foreign Minister Ciano. Parliamentary sources here have stated that the number of troops stationed on the Italian island of Rhodes in the Mediterranean has also recently increased. The Italian side has not notified Britain in advance in accordance with the Anglo-Italian agreement, which the government is quite anxious about. In addition, Italy may take action against Albania, and the Croat ethnic group in Yugoslavia is also showing signs of unrest, due to German incitement. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The Counselor of the British Embassy in Italy, Mr. Charles, visited Italian Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday, and again requested an explanation regarding the Italian government's repeated decisions to increase troops in its North African territory of Libya. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Authoritative sources announced today that Mussolini will deliver an important speech on March 26 to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Party, mentioning Italy's demands.

<h3>Chamberlain's Resignation Untrue; Cabinet Inevitably to Be Reorganized; Labour Party Refuses Cooperation; Conscription to Be Implemented</h3>
<p>(London) A Reuters parliamentary reporter said that members are widely speculating that Foreign Secretary Halifax is now initiating the organization of a new national unity government based on a broader foundation. Many Conservative MPs support this. It is said that the new government will recruit Eden and Churchill, and conscription may be submitted to Parliament. The purpose is to create a line that will never yield to Germany. Key Conservative MPs have not shown any signs of disagreement. Prime Minister Chamberlain feels pained by the recent developments in Central Europe, but compulsory national service and compulsory military service cannot be carried out without considering the attitude of the other side. It is heard that Labour MPs will take a cold attitude towards the proposal to expand the government, but the Liberal Party will not. The government previously avoided compulsory national service because of strong opposition from the Labour Party and trade unions. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The rumors that British Prime Minister Chamberlain is about to resign are unfounded. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain is scheduled to deliver a speech in Birmingham tonight. According to informed sources here, the Prime Minister will issue a serious warning to Germany regarding the partition of Czechoslovakia, and it is even possible to announce the strengthening of the national voluntary service system, thereby implementing compulsory military service. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the situation in Central Europe, the newspapers here all say that political figures are extremely anxious. When the Conservative parliamentary group met last night, many advocated that Britain should implement conscription. According to The Times, "The Conservative Foreign Affairs Committee held a meeting yesterday to conduct a precise discussion on the European situation. Although many people attended, few criticized Prime Minister Chamberlain. It can be seen that although the Munich Agreement has produced bitter consequences, Prime Minister Chamberlain's position has not been damaged as a result. On the contrary, all the MPs clearly advocated the implementation of national service on a broad scale to be prepared for emergencies." (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) After the major changes in Central Europe, parliamentary figures here all said that the general staffs of Britain and France should conduct talks again to discuss cooperation methods, and the visit of French President Lebrun to Britain at the end of this month will be politically more important than expected as a result. The British and French governments have planned to jointly issue a declaration explaining the attitude that Britain and France should take when Switzerland or the Netherlands are invaded. Prime Minister Chamberlain will make an important declaration in Birmingham tonight and is currently deliberating the wording with a small cabinet meeting. In addition, all cabinet members said that the situation is evolving in such a way that the cabinet must make a strong and resolute statement in order to convince the majority of MPs and the people of the country. Among the MPs of all factions, some criticized the attitude expressed by Chancellor of the Exchequer Simon in the House of Commons yesterday as being too mild, and therefore were deeply dissatisfied. More than 200 Conservative MPs, at a meeting last night, although some criticized the current policy, still supported Prime Minister Chamberlain in the majority. Among them, Sir Knox said, "Now is not the time for official criticism, we must think about the future," and advocated changing the national voluntary service system to compulsory service. Those around Prime Minister Chamberlain said that the Prime Minister felt that he had been deceived by Hitler, but he should continue to work hard to save the situation and restore the reputation of the current policy. Foreign Secretary Halifax, due to the serious situation, advocated promoting conscription. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Someone proposed the implementation of conscription at the meeting of the Conservative Foreign Affairs Committee today. A large portion of the 120 attendees expressed their support. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) The rumours about the reorganization of the Cabinet are rife. Although the Conservative Party is eager to form a Cabinet of national unity, a key figure believes that as long as Prime Minister Chamberlain is in power, the opposition Labour Party will refuse to join the Cabinet for a single day. In other words, the Labour Party leaders regard the thorough change of the current domestic and foreign policies as a prerequisite for joining the Cabinet. In terms of foreign policy, the party advocates uniting all peaceful forces and maintaining frequent contact with the United States, France, the Soviet Union, and various small countries in Europe. In terms of domestic policy, the party absolutely does not want to promote conscription and compulsory service in peacetime. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) During today's meeting of the House of Commons, opposition Labour MP Macklum asked the government whether it intended to recall the ambassador to Germany. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "The government is still considering whether to instruct Ambassador Henderson to return home to report." The Prime Minister's decision statement was highly valued by the general public, who believed that the government was considering negotiating with Germany over the Czech issue, or that the government was indeed planning to recall Ambassador Henderson, thereby expressing its dissatisfaction with Germany's occupation of Czechoslovakia. In addition, the delegation of the Federation of British Industries, which is currently in Düsseldorf, Germany, negotiating with the German business community, originally planned to go to Berlin, but it is now learned that the plan has been abandoned and it has been decided to return directly to London tomorrow. Due to these various reasons, Parliament expects that the government may abandon its appeasement policy and work with the Soviet Union to promote friendship, replacing the understanding between Britain and Germany. Well-informed sources here have confirmed that the Cabinet will be reorganized immediately. Former Foreign Secretary Eden and former First Lord of the Admiralty Duff Cooper will enter the Cabinet, and even Churchill, the leader of the Conservative right wing, may also be in the list of cabinet members. Some even said that Prime Minister Chamberlain would resign within a short period of time. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The French business delegation, led by Mr. Arfan, Director of the Commercial Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been here for many days and returned to Paris today. The delegation signed an agreement with the German government authorities to revise the current commercial agreements between the two countries in order to adapt to the situation after Germany annexed the Sudetenland region. Then, they continued to conduct talks to discuss other economic issues. These talks have now been suspended for some reason, and the delegation has packed up and returned home. (Havas, 16th)</p>

<p>(London) Following Chancellor Hitler's announcement yesterday that Bohemia and Moravia were to become German protectorates, the Czech Embassy in London was taken over by officials from the German Embassy. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Czech Minister to France, Mr. Chvalkovský, refuses to hand over the embassy to German Embassy personnel, stating that he has only seen the events in his country reported in the newspapers and has not yet received any orders from his government. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) When German Embassy personnel attempted to take over the Czech Embassy, the Czech Minister, Mr. Hurban, refused, saying that he had not received instructions from his government and was not authorized to hand it over. Political and diplomatic circles here have expressed their sympathy, but believe that Minister Hurban will eventually receive such instructions, so the handover is only a matter of time.

<h3>Yan Xishan Discusses Military Affairs in Shanxi Province - Preparing for Long-Term Guerrilla Warfare - One Million Able-Bodied Men in Training - Over 10,000 Japanese Soldiers Annihilated in the Past Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Reuters Special Correspondent's dispatch, March 10th (from General Yan Xishan's headquarters in a certain location in Shaanxi Province): After a week-long journey on horseback and in cars, the Reuters reporter finally arrived at the secret headquarters of General Yan Xishan, Commander-in-Chief of the Second War Area of China, which includes the entire province of Shanxi and parts of the provinces of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. The headquarters is located in a</p>
<p>cave city in the mountainous region bordering Shaanxi. The geological structure of both Shaanxi and Shanxi provinces is ideally suited for excavating caves, and the Chinese army has made full use of this, as it can withstand air raids. The entire cliff face has been excavated into living quarters, offices, stables, etc. The reporter was invited to stay in a cave bedroom upon arrival, which was quite comfortable. The reporter was provided with a single-page daily newspaper published there to read. The next morning, I was informed that Mr. Yan was ready to receive me. I met Mr. Yan in another cave, the walls of which were covered with military maps, which was the location of the staff headquarters. Mr. Yan sat at the desk, wearing glasses on his nose, with</p>
<p>grey hair and a kind face, dressed in a blue provincial military uniform. To Mr. Yan's right was his Chief of Staff, Mr. Zhu, a burly man wearing a yellow woolen uniform of a central government officer. Mr. Yan said, "Japan is strong and China is weak, but we must deal with them. Therefore, we have reformed our strategy and will use our strength to attack the weaknesses of the Japanese. We have now begun to use the power of the entire people in the war and are training the military and civilians according to</p>
<p>three methods: (1) special training for officers, (2) training for the people, (3) training the army in guerrilla tactics. China is currently proceeding according to the following principles: (1) unity and cooperation between the military and civilians, (2) unity between officers and soldiers, (3) seizing opportunities to attack the enemy, (4) avoiding unnecessary losses. There are currently one million Shanxi people in training to assist the national army and destroy the Japanese. Most of their training is political. We must make them understand the meaning of this decisive battle, unite them, and</p>
<p>provide them with weapons. They have now made Japanese rule ineffective. Every time the Japanese occupy a place, the local government and post office move slightly backward and continue to perform their duties. In Shanxi Province, except for the three northern counties which have been merged and governed by one county magistrate, each of the remaining counties still has a county magistrate who performs his duties as usual. Even most of those called traitors are not truly traitors; many of them are serving us. Shanxi Province is now actively preparing for long-term guerrilla warfare. A large number of regular troops are moving behind Japanese lines to</p>
<p>encircle the Japanese and have established bases for self-sufficiency for the troops in the mountains. In addition to ammunition, these troops can rely on the villages for all their living needs, because the people's assistance is available at any time. Full attention is currently being paid to the issue of ammunition supply. It is estimated that there are more than fifty divisions in the occupied areas of Shanxi Province, two-thirds of which are regular troops. In the past two weeks, there have been a total of 240 battles within this war zone.</p>
<p>More than 10,000 Japanese soldiers were intercepted. The current new strategy is to avoid large-scale battles, so the above were only small skirmishes. Because the railways are often cut off, the Japanese have begun to build blockhouses along the railway lines. The Chinese army is preparing to attack them. In short, the Japanese will never gain true control of Shanxi Province," he said. When Mr. Yan left the mountain cave where we spoke, he rode a specially prepared healthy donkey back to his residence.</p>
<h3>Korean and Taiwanese Soldiers Unable to Endure Abuse - Mutiny Occurs in Foshan - Regiment Commander Araki Stabbed - Leading Soldiers Tragically Beheaded</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence. Recent months in the Guangdong war situation have seen no significant changes, except for the Japanese army's sudden landing on Hainan Island. The positions of the Chinese and Japanese armies remain unchanged in the East River, North River, and West River, with no further developments. Although the Japanese army has repeatedly claimed to launch a major advance on the upper reaches of the Gan River to threaten Guangxi, and has launched continuous attacks in the Sanshui area, they have all been in vain and lack the real strength to break through the Chinese army's defense lines. In the past month, they have fallen silent, indicating that the Japanese army invading Guangdong is outwardly strong but inwardly weak. The war situation and other conditions in various parts of Guangdong Province are recorded below.</p>
<p>Raid on Leizhou Foiled</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army attacked Hainan Island, the situation in the Leizhou Peninsula in southern Guangdong has been extremely tense. With the war situation in various parts of Guangdong Province stagnating, the Japanese army's invasion of Guangxi will obviously seek another route. There are two new routes into Guangxi: one is to land on the Leizhou Peninsula and attack the rear of the Chinese army's positions in the West River, and the other is to land in Beihai in southern Guangdong, directly attack Nanning to the north, attack Liuzhou, and take Guilin. Therefore, around the Lunar New Year, Japanese warships gathered and shelled various coastal areas of Beihai and the Leizhou Peninsula. Japanese planes constantly bombed the aforementioned areas, especially Leizhou. However, due to the strict defense of the Chinese army on the shore and the complete destruction of road traffic, if the Japanese army landed and invaded, not only would they encounter strong resistance from the brave soldiers of Guangxi, but also continuous attacks from the local people. The mechanized troops would completely lose their effectiveness, and it is feared that they would be embarrassed in the future advance and retreat, causing the strength of South China to be further dispersed. Therefore, they have never dared to act rashly. The Leizhou Peninsula, which protrudes into the sea, and Beihai, which is isolated on the edge of Guangzhou Bay, remain as they were, because of this. However, the Japanese army's intention to advance from Guangdong to Guangxi is the main strategy in its South China war situation and will not be easily abandoned. Therefore, everyone knows that the opening of the war on the Leizhou Peninsula is only a matter of time. Indeed, on the 3rd, 4th, and 5th of this month, Japanese planes bombed various important county towns along the coast of the Leizhou Peninsula, such as Haikang and Xuwen, causing heavy damage to civilian buildings. On the morning of the 6th, Japanese warships suddenly sailed into Shidao Port in Haikang, dispatching troops on more than a dozen motorboats, launching an attack and landing under the cover of fierce artillery fire. They engaged in a fierce battle with the Chinese defending forces. After about an hour, the Japanese army was defeated and retreated. The same thing happened in Xuwen, and the result was also unsuccessful. Therefore, the situation on the Leizhou Peninsula has been extremely tense in recent days. Residents in various places have retreated into the interior. The garrison is on strict alert. Traffic is cut off. The landscape is desolate, like a battlefield. However, this type of offensive is still exploratory. If the Japanese army is determined to land, the opening of the war will be extremely fierce.</p>
<p>Korean and Taiwanese Soldiers Mutiny in Guangdong</p>
<p>Most of the Japanese troops in various parts of Guangdong Province were transferred from Taiwan and the Northeast. Korean and Taiwanese soldiers account for half of them, and regular Japanese troops account for the other half. In the past, the Japanese troops who fought in China, whenever there were Korean and Taiwanese soldiers, they did not go to the front line to fight, because they were not only afraid that their fighting would be ineffective, which would harm the overall situation, but also strictly prevented them from defecting and mutiny. However, the Japanese troops invading Guangdong really had no soldiers to transfer from the country, and the front line was extended. Both the front and rear had to station heavy troops. They had no choice but to dig into their own flesh to make up for the sore, and transferred a large number of Korean and Taiwanese soldiers to join the war. However, it was because of this that mutinies often occurred in the Japanese army in Guangdong Province, whether in the front or rear. Recently, another mutiny occurred in Foshan. Because Foshan is close to Guangzhou, it made the Japanese army entrenched in the provincial capital extremely panicked. According to reports, the Japanese troops in Foshan have now been transferred to Hainan Island to fight. Most of the remaining troops are Korean and Taiwanese soldiers. Since the beginning of this year, a food shortage has occurred in various parts of Guangdong Province, which has also caused a serious famine in the Japanese army. They are still not full with one bowl of porridge and one bowl of rice a day. In addition, the Japanese treat Korean and Taiwanese soldiers worse. Salaries are not paid on a monthly basis. For these two reasons, more than a hundred Korean and Taiwanese soldiers stationed in Shiwanzhen, Foshan, mutinied at the beginning of the month. First, they demanded that Regiment Commander Araki pay off the arrears, and then stabbed him, scattering and harassing. When the Japanese artillery team stationed in Lanshi heard the news, they urgently telegraphed the Guangzhou Japanese Military Police Headquarters for help, and then came out to suppress them, arresting all the mutinying soldiers and escorting them to Guangzhou. On the morning of the 7th, more than a dozen leading mutinying soldiers were beheaded by the Japanese military police in Zhongshan Park in Guangzhou to show the public. The rest are still detained in the military police camp, waiting to be transported back to their country.</p>
<p>Food Problem in Various Parts of the Province</p>
<p>In addition to the war situation, there is a serious problem in the interior of Guangdong that needs to be rescued urgently, that is, the widespread and profound food panic. If there is no appropriate response to this question, the suffering of tens of millions of Guangdong people will become more and more serious. Guangdong Province is not a rice-producing area. Half of the province's food is supplied by Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. In the past, during the peaceful era, every early spring, when the old grain was exhausted and the new grain was not yet available, food panic would occur in the East River, Chaozhou-Shantou, and South Road areas. Since the outbreak of the war, the rice from Hunan and Jiangxi has been unable to be transported in, and the grain stored by farmers has been looted by the Japanese army. Moreover, spring plowing has been suspended, so the food panic has become more profound. Most of the people in the East River, West River, and North River have no rice to cook. The price of rice is soaring. One yuan is not enough to buy four catties of brown rice. Therefore, recently, local authorities have been extremely anxious. It is reported that the Guangdong authorities have jointly telegraphed the central government to approve the purchase of one million piculs of duty-free foreign rice for relief. However, this small amount is only enough to temporarily relieve the panic in the Chaozhou, Shantou, and Mei prefectures in eastern Guangdong and the vicinity of Beihai in northern Guangdong. Western and northern Guangdong still need to find ways to import domestic rice for relief. According to people from the interior, farmers in various parts of the West River and North River can still fill their stomachs with potatoes and other things. In the occupied areas of the East River, even miscellaneous grains have been exhausted. The suffering of the people is unspeakable and awaits the overall relief of the authorities. (March 12)</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Harassing Sanmen Bay Sea Area</h3>
<p>Ningbo Communication: Three small Japanese warships sailed into the waters off Jiantiao, Sanmen Bay, around 7:00 AM on the 14th, cruising back and forth, and put down small boats to strafe passing civilian ships with machine guns. At about 11:00 AM on the 15th, they put down a motorboat with more than a dozen soldiers, rushed to Maotou Mountain in Ninghai County, forcibly landed, and searched for civilian food, chickens, pigs, and other livestock. Later, the Chinese army arrived and, together with the people's team, fought hard to resist and drove the Japanese soldiers back to the ship. Currently, the three Japanese warships have retreated to the sea area more than fifty miles away from Jiantiao, harassing passing fishing boats.</p>
<h3>Banditry Rampant on Mount Putuo, Zhejiang</h3>
<p>Dinghai Communication: Since the bandit gang led by Pan Zhao Cai landed on Mount Putuo on the 27th of last month, they have been entrenched on the mountain, looting everywhere. Recently, they have recruited scattered bandits and local ruffians, hooligans, and fugitives from nearby islands. Their momentum is growing day by day. They are now selling drugs and gambling, and sending leaders, such as Miao, to entrench themselves on Hulu Island. The bandit leader, Lin, is traveling on the sea by boat, intercepting passing merchant ships. The order of the entire mountain is chaotic, and pilgrims are reluctant to come.</p>
<h3>Forming Mutual Aid Associations to Relieve Displaced Refugees - Initiated by Wang Kunlun and Others</h3>
<p>Chongqing Communication: Since the War of Resistance, more than tens of millions of people have fled from the provinces of North China, Central China, and Southeast China to the Northwest and Southwest to escape the chaos. They are displaced and miserable. Although they have received government relief, there is still much to be desired. The general refugees with meager assets have exhausted their resources in the past twenty months, and their future is very difficult. The general civil servants who have been evacuated are very difficult and their situation is pitiful. Now, Wang Kunlun and others have initiated a mutual aid association to gather members and sympathizers to carry out various social undertakings in the spirit of self-help and mutual assistance, improve the lives of refugees, and engage in production and construction. The general association is located on Shuncheng Street in Linjiang, Chongqing, and branch associations are set up throughout the Northwest and Southwest. It is heard that the association welcomes organizations from all over the country to establish branches in order to facilitate contact.</p>

<p>Yangshuo Communication: The Yangshuo County Government copied the names of nineteen soldiers from this city and decided to talk to the families of some of these patriotic soldiers.</p>
<p>At the end of a small alley on County Front Street, at the corner facing the low city wall along the Li River, there is a house with six or seven neat stone steps in front of the door. In this scholarly family, I found Chen Xiwei's eldest brother, Xixin, and his third younger brother, Xigao, who is studying in junior high school at the county high school. Xiwei is twenty-eight years old this year. He graduated from the cadre training class and the wireless electricity school. After the Lugouqiao Incident, he bravely joined Liao Lei's army to participate in the War of Resistance. I saw his recent letter from Li Huang County, Anhui, which said in essence: "... I sent two letters earlier to encourage my brother, and I am very worried about you. My body is as usual, don't worry. I heard that Guilin, Liuzhou, Pingle and other places have also suffered losses. I hope that brother Xin and brothers will build a thatched cottage in Shuangtan, our county, as soon as possible for temporary residence, so as to avoid panic and have extra land to cultivate. ..." Although it was simply written on a sheet of letter paper, it clearly shows his enthusiasm for protecting the country and loving his family.</p>
<p>His wife took his young son back to her mother's house to celebrate the New Year. I saw his two sons studying in the Central Elementary School. It is said that the youngest one has also entered kindergarten. The Guangxi Province originally stipulated that the families of soldiers on expeditions could receive 300 catties of preferential rice every year. Starting from last winter, it will be distributed quarterly in four installments. They have received nine yuan of Guangxi currency (four yuan and five jiao of legal tender) for the seventy-five catties of grain. His brothers and sons all believe that the expedition of their brothers and fathers is a glorious thing.</p>
<p>The second family member of a soldier I visited was Zheng Qiaoqiao's old father and elder brother. Their house is outside the city street, surrounded by patches of green vegetable gardens. A slippery and messy stone path runs through the side of his house. They have a vegetable garden, which is now cultivated by the old father. His elder brother is a butcher, and does not have the temperament of a farmer.</p>
<p>Qiaoqiao is the second child, twenty-seven years old this year. He has received reserve training. His wife has passed away. Two younger brothers are studying at the county elementary school for free. His family has not been greatly affected since the expedition. His old father said to me like a familiar friend: "Qiaoqiao was the first to enlist on the fourth day of August in the twenty-sixth year. I sent him to the North Gate of Guilin before I came back. Later, he formed a team in the county and then set off to the north. We received a letter from Hankou, which said in essence, "We will not fight until Shanghai, and then we will fight out of Shanhaiguan." He told us not to worry. The child is ambitious and I heard that he has been promoted to platoon leader." He pointed to another vegetable garden to the east of his house and said: "Xie Sijiu's son, Xie Qijin, is in Qiaoqiao's platoon."</p>
<p>"The government treats the families of soldiers on expeditions well. We have received a few Guangxi currency. The county magistrate has also rewarded us with five cents (two jiao and five fen of legal tender), and we have also received a few steamed buns and two packs of biscuits." The old gardener, who is almost sixty years old, happily told me. I took the opportunity to compliment him a few times. He suddenly remembered to invite me to drink tea. I thanked him and said: "I still want to go to Xie Qijin's house!" He still asked his eldest son to make tea while leading me out of the garden gate with a smile.</p>
<p>Although Xie Qijin's father was also planting a vegetable garden, his family was not as good as the old gardener who had a pig-killing son. Two rooms, one is the hall and the kitchen, and the other is the bedroom and pigsty. He seemed to talk to outsiders very little. He did not understand my words, and it was difficult for me to understand his words. After a long time, I learned that Qijin was eighteen years old and had not married a wife. He enlisted in early August two years ago and had received nine yuan of Guangxi currency. He said that he had not received anything else.</p>
<p>Xie Sijiu, whose eyes were a little blurred, took out his son's letter from his arms and showed it to me, saying: "His body is very good, please don't worry at home."</p>
<p>When I stepped out of Xie Sijiu's vegetable garden, the peaks of Yangshuo's suburbs were all covered in the sea of clouds. The fog was very thick and felt like light raindrops on my face. The fields were lush and green, which was pleasing to the eye. I saw that it was still early, so I followed the messy stone path, passed through the ancient city gate that looked like a stone bridge cave, which could be reached with one hand, and walked towards the cone-shaped Duxiu Peak. Xie Sijiu told me that Li Qiaosheng's house was under Duxiu Peak.</p>
<p>After bypassing an area of paddy fields, I gradually heard the sound of gurgling water. As the road turned, I saw that the stream water was divided into three layers, and each layer of more than one foot of stream water poured from a high place into a clear and green pool. It then flowed under a large rock floating on the surface of the water. A bend in the river, and there is a small round-hole bridge. The green moss on the bridge stones and the small flowers and plants in the stone cracks seemed to be reporting its ancient history to me. The water flowed across the bridge and made a small sound, heading towards a place I didn't know. Stepping over the rocks, Li Qiaosheng's three tile houses and two thatched houses in a secluded village were revealed behind the pine and bamboo and some tropical trees. This small bridge, flowing water, and family brought me into a wonderful poetic realm. At the same time, it was like seeing a painting by Wang Wei, "Streams and Mountains in Mist and Rain". That kind of extraordinary and refined scenery sent a thought of transcending the world.</p>
<p>I saw a young woman, wearing a bamboo hat, carrying buckets towards another direction. Although I couldn't determine whether she was Li Qiaosheng's wife, I knew that she was a member of this secluded village. Stepping into the fence gate, I let a small white dog bark softly behind me, walked across the small drying ground, and walked towards the tile house.</p>
<p>An old woman with white hair expressed a surprised welcome to me, the unexpected guest. She admitted that she was Li Qiaosheng's grandmother. She was warming herself by starting a fire on the ground in the hall with pine firewood. The pine firewood was still wet, emitting a stinging white smoke. I pulled a low stool and sat down by the fire and asked about Li Qiaosheng's family. She told me that Qiaosheng's mother had gone to the market to sell vegetables, and Qiaosheng's wife had gone out to collect pig feed because the family had two pigs.</p>
<p>She hurriedly ran out of the house, stood outside the fence gate, and shouted in a loud voice like a middle-aged woman. Then I heard another loud voice also shouting. Thanks to the echoes from the surrounding mountains, this lovable old woman only shouted three times and called her grandson's wife back.</p>
<p>Li Qiaosheng's wife put the pole on the drying ground, like a young farmer, and followed her old grandmother into the hall. She took off the big, round, yellow and shiny bamboo hat, revealing her head wrapped in blue floral cloth. Her fair face, slender eyebrows, and a pair of dignified eyes were a rare beauty for a Guangxi farmer. Her wide chest indicated that she had a child to breastfeed. Her blue cloth trousers, revealing her calves, and bare big feet indicated that she was as strong and hardworking as other Guangxi farmers. When asked about her husband, she was unable to say anything. Fortunately, the old grandmother asked her question by question on my behalf, and she only answered me slowly.</p>
<p>Li Qiaosheng is her son-in-law who lives in her family. He is twenty-seven years old this year. He enlisted in the army after marriage, and this year is the fifth year. In June two years ago, the Lugouqiao Incident occurred, and the troops in this province went to the north. He passed by Yangshuo and stayed at home for three days. Now there are his mother, sister, grandmother, and a son who has been separated from his father since birth in the family.</p>
<p>She went into a dark room to get two letters that had already been torn and showed them to me, saying: "The most recent one was sent to the county government. (Later I learned that the Guangxi Provincial Government would order each county to collect the soldier's family letters that can be used as a model.) These are letters from July of the year before last and last year." I saw "Li Qiaosheng's Mother Received" written on the first letter. Inside it said, "The soldiers on expeditions have certificates, which can exempt them from all civil engineering costs. If the village office wants you to go to civil engineering, take the certificate to see, you are strong, don't worry." The second letter was sent from the "An Yuan No. 62 Rear Hospital in Pingxiang, Jiangxi". It was undoubtedly "injured in battle", but it was not mentioned in the letter. It only said that his body was very good. Looking at his wife, she still didn't know.</p>
<p>When I asked about "preferential treatment", Li Qiaosheng's wife became excited. She told me: "At the end of last year, I received nine Guangxi currency. The county magistrate also personally sent steamed buns and biscuits here." She also pointed to the red paper strip with the words "Strive for Glory for the Country" in the center of the door panel in the hall and said: "He also put this glorious paper strip on for us!"</p>
<p>Seeing that the scenery in front of the door was gradually darkening, I said goodbye to them. A burst of baby's crying came from the dark back. I asked the young mother to take care of the child quickly, but I could not refuse the old woman's enthusiasm to send me out of the fence. When I walked over the big rock floating on the stream, I turned around and took a last glimpse of the secluded village under Duxiu Peak. She was still standing there. Li Qiaosheng's wife was holding a fat son close to her. The little white dog wagged its short tail at their feet. I waved my hand and asked them to go in. The messy stone path turned a bend, and the rain-covered trees cut it off.</p>

<h3>Northern Jiangsu Refugees Flee to Shanghai</h3>
<p>An estimated crowd of over a thousand people. Chinese troops will prepare a counter-offensive.</p>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, the situation in northern Jiangsu is tense due to military operations. Over a thousand people from the area, in several boats, fled to Shanghai yesterday (the 16th). They were thoroughly inspected by the public concession police stationed at Pier 12 before landing. According to those who arrived in Shanghai on the British ship "Kristin Maersk," they came here because of the tense situation in northern Jiangsu.</p>
<p>The majority are carrying bedding and other miscellaneous items, indicating that they intend to stay here for some time. The British ship also brought pigs, chickens, and other goods from northern Jiangsu. Chinese sources previously reported that war clouds were gathering in the Jiangbei area along the river. As many as 90,000 Chinese regular troops and guerrillas are rushing to various strategic locations to prepare for an offensive against the Japanese army. According to those who came to Shanghai yesterday, the counter-offensive has not officially begun. The battles north of Taizhou and Shaobo are already underway. The battles occurred several days before they came to Shanghai.</p>
<p>There had been fighting before they set off, but it had subsided. A village north of Taizhou has fallen. As for the situation in areas such as Nantong and Qidong, which were previously reported to be preparing for an offensive by the Chinese army, they did not know. It is also reported that the Japanese army is attempting to attack these areas in order to cut off the supplies of the Chinese army operating in the area and to monopolize the area by preventing shipping, allowing Japanese shipping companies to exclusively profit.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Gentry Petition to Purchase Foreign Rice to Aid Ningbo's Food Supply</h3>
<p>Telegraph to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to forward to the Ministry of Finance for approval.</p>
<p>Shanghai-based gentry and merchants from Ningbo, Yu Qiaqing and Jin Tingsun, etc., because Ningbo is not a rice-producing area, and after the war, Shanghai controlled the re-export of rice, so the food supply for the people was often inadequate. They sent a letter to the Ningbo County government, seeking a joint petition to the Zhejiang Provincial Government to forward to the Ministry of Finance, requesting approval to purchase foreign exchange to order 50,000 to 100,000 shi of Saigon and Siam foreign rice to regulate the food supply in Zhejiang Province. It has already been approved by the Ningbo County government, so Yu and others jointly telegraphed Chairman Huang of Zhejiang Province requesting it.</p>
<h3>The Czech Embassy in Shanghai Taken Over by the German Embassy</h3>
<p>The Czech Minister and his wife have moved. Czech expatriates are in a state of grief and indignation.</p>
<p>Czech expatriates in Shanghai have been quite anxious since receiving the latest news from Europe. They expressed anger at the developments following Hitler's sudden invasion on Wednesday. However, most Czech expatriates were too shocked to offer any criticism. The Czech Minister to China, Seba, etc., continued to work as usual at the embassy at 727 Haig Road in the city every day before the 15th, but the outside world paid close attention to their movements. According to the minister's statement to the outside world the day before yesterday, he was waiting for instructions. However, on the 16th, the embassy gate was suddenly closed, which made the Czech expatriates in Shanghai even more anxious. It was learned yesterday (the 17th) that the embassy had been taken over by personnel sent by the German Embassy, and the Czech Minister Seba had moved out of the embassy and temporarily resided in a hotel with his wife. After this news spread, the Czech expatriates were very sad and indignant. However, whether the future fate and the management of commercial property in Shanghai must be transferred to the German Embassy, or whether they must obtain "protection" passports, remains to be seen. There are many Czech expatriates in Shanghai, and the exact number is not yet known. They occupy a prominent position in Shanghai's social and business circles. Bata Shoe Company, one of the world's largest shoe companies, is a Czech business and has no fewer than seven branches in Shanghai alone. In peacetime, branches are also located in Hangzhou, Hankou, Suzhou, Tianjin, and Qingdao.</p>
<h3>External Transfer of Postal Workers Soon to Depart</h3>
<p>The Bureau Accepts Four Requests</p>
<p>Recently, the Directorate General of Posts of the Ministry of Communications, due to the accumulation of mail in Hunan, Guangxi, and Guizhou provinces, which urgently needs to be sorted out, and because the work efficiency of postal workers in the interior is relatively slow, ordered the Shanghai Postal Administration to select 65 capable postal workers to work in each of these provinces. After receiving the order, the post office selected 65 capable postal workers and issued a bureau order, requiring them to depart uniformly by the 16th of this month. After receiving the news, the transferred personnel felt that the matter was sudden and there was not enough time to arrange luggage, and that the treatment was meager, which caused many difficulties. The Postal Workers' Union submitted a request to the bureau to cancel the above order and change it to voluntary registration for external transfer, but the authorities did not approve it, which caused dissatisfaction among the postal workers.</p>
<p>The Bureau Accepts Four Conditions: The Postal Workers' Union and the Trade Union, in order to prevent disputes from occurring, convened a joint meeting to discuss countermeasures. The result was a resolution to obey the government's order and accept the external transfer, but to postpone the departure date and make four requests: (1) During the extraordinary period, the transferred personnel should receive a living allowance in addition to maintaining their original subsidies; (2) The deadline for travel expenses for the families of the transferred personnel should be specially extended; (3) The transferred personnel should be transferred back to the Shanghai Bureau for service as soon as possible when the following situations occur: A. When the service location evacuates bureau personnel, B. When the war is won, C. When the local business is not needed; (4) If the families of the transferred personnel need to mail necessities such as clothing to the transferred personnel themselves, they can send them free of charge. The representatives of the two associations then presented the requests to Postmaster General Chapellin and Postal Assistant Wang Weisheng, who sincerely accepted them. They have been submitted to the Directorate General for approval and are expected to be approved.</p>
<p>Preparing Luggage and Departing on Schedule: After the bureau accepted the four requests and agreed to postpone the departure date, the postal workers, in order to obey the order and take care of the overall situation, unanimously agreed to the external transfer and scheduled to leave Shanghai successively on April 1. These days they are arranging their families and preparing their luggage. They will first take a boat to Wenzhou, then transfer to the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway in Jinhua and go to various provinces. The bureau has already purchased boat tickets from the Audit Department. At the same time, the Postal Workers' Union purchased medicines and food for the trip. Letters were also sent to the Postal Workers' Unions along the way, asking them to take good care of the postal workers when they arrive. At that time, postal workers will also go to the dock to see them off.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Committee Investigates Rice Warehouse Stocks</h3>
<p>Arrivals are quite strong, rice prices continue to fall. The serious situation is gradually becoming a thing of the past.</p>
<h3>Write to the authorities to carefully plan good strategies to maintain this permanently.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Rice Industry Association Evaluation Committee sent a letter to the authorities of the two concessions yesterday, reporting on the establishment process and submitting the assessed rice price list for filing. In the future, the method of investigating the rice stocks in Shanghai will be stipulated at any time. Arrivals have been strong in recent days, and rice prices are becoming more stable. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Dispatch Personnel to Investigate Stocks at Any Time: The Rice Industry Association Evaluation Committee, considering that the stock levels are greatly related to rice prices, has dispatched specialists to conduct investigations of rice stocks in various rice warehouses at any time, and has compiled an investigation form, which is quite detailed, including items such as the name of the warehouse, the name of the manager, the capacity, and the address of the rice warehouse. After the investigation form is completed, it will be sent to the seven rice industry associations and reported to the authorities of the two concessions for filing. The association sent a letter to each rice warehouse yesterday to assist in this procedure.</p>
<p>Arrivals are Quite Strong, Rice Prices Continue to Fall: Since the Soybean and Rice Industry Association earnestly persuaded vendors to resume transportation and continue procurement, arrivals have been quite strong in recent days, and rice prices have continued to fall. White japonica rice has fallen back to 13.45 yuan or 78 cents per shi, which is below the assessed price limit. It is heard that various vendor merchants are following the advice of the Soybean and Rice Industry Association and are continuing to procure, and the sources will become more prosperous. Therefore, the serious situation of rice shortages in the city is gradually becoming a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Assessed Rice Prices Reported for Filing: The following letter was sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Concession Council yesterday: "Dear Sirs, Recently, the food supply for Shanghai residents has been affected by the direct loading and transportation of rice from the interior to other places, resulting in scarce sources and rising rice prices. The Soybean and Rice Industry Association decided to maintain the original price limit, with the highest price of white rice not exceeding 14 yuan per shi, and reported the situation to your council for filing on the 8th of this month. Subsequently, although the market price limit has fortunately not been exceeded, the prices of middle and inferior rice have risen uniformly, and the market has become slightly chaotic. The rice industry associations believe that the failure to stabilize rice prices is a major concern for the food supply, and on the 13th of this month, the Soybean and Rice Industry Association invited representatives from the Rice Store Association, the Rice Grain Retail Association, the Shanghai Northern Rice Merchant Association, the Rice Milling Association, the Changshu Guildhall, and the Southern Guildhall to jointly resolve to organize an Evaluation Committee. The committee will assess prices at any time based on the price limit set by the Soybean and Rice Industry Association, differentiating between middle and inferior grades, with the aim of cooperation between the shipping, vendor, and store parties to jointly maintain the stability of rice prices. Fifteen members were elected by the various organizations, and the first committee meeting was convened on the 15th of this month to formulate simple rules and announce the establishment. This is the origin of the organization of our committee. However, at a time when stocks are not lacking, but sources are still not prosperous, it is feared that our efforts will not be able to bear the heavy responsibility of stabilizing rice prices from beginning to end. We hope that your council will carefully plan good strategies to jointly maintain the food supply for the people. This is especially what our committee deeply prays for. We hereby enclose the committee's simple rules, the list of committee members, and the assessed rice price list for your review and filing. We are deeply grateful."</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Obstructs Foreign Shipping: Haimen Attacked by Cannon Fire Again</h3>
<p>Companies will request consuls to negotiate resumption of shipping methods. Resumption will inevitably be postponed.</p>
<p>Haimen, Zhejiang, was bombarded by Japanese warships again on the 15th, with minimal damage. The local situation is as peaceful as usual. The Ningbo-Taizhou route is preparing to resume. The Shanghai-Taizhou route still needs to be awaited. The Shanghai-Dinghai route allows dedicated ships to load fish. The Hana will depart from Dinghai for Shanghai for the first time on the 20th. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Repeatedly Bombard Haimen: After the Japanese warships repeatedly bombarded and harassed Haimen, Zhejiang, without success, it was recently reported by the shipping industry that at 4 p.m. on the 15th of this month, four Japanese warships sailed from the Damenshan area to the vicinity of the Jiaojiang Estuary blockade line, first launching speedboats to scout and then firing 80 to 90 shells at the urban area of Haimen, injuring nine people and destroying dozens of houses, with no other losses. Two of the Japanese warships seized three civilian ships around 5 p.m. and sailed away, while the other two remained anchored overnight and then sailed away.</p>
<p>The Military and Civilians are Calm and the Situation is Peaceful: Since the Japanese side had designs on Haimen, our military authorities have stepped up defenses and stationed heavy troops along the coast, while evacuating residents and investigating traitors who spread rumors. Although Japanese warships have repeatedly intruded, they have ultimately failed due to our strong defenses. When they fired again on the 15th, our troops calmly responded. Seeing that we were prepared, the Japanese warships did nothing but fire aimlessly. Therefore, the situation in Haimen is now extremely peaceful. Shops are open as usual, and residents are accustomed to the Japanese warships firing and are extremely calm.</p>
<p>The Intention is Clearly to Obstruct Navigation: Haimen and Jiaojiang have been blockaded, and shipping has been suspended for a long time. In order to facilitate transportation, the authorities are dredging the Jiaojiang waterway and re-registering ships to prepare for resumption of shipping. However, the Japanese side has made excuses for unfinished military affairs and has obstructed the effort, preventing it from being realized. Recently, the authorities approved the request of shipping companies to allow registered ships to anchor at Sanjiangkou, more than 20 li away from Haimen, to load and unload passengers and cargo. However, the Japanese warships bombarded Haimen again on the 15th, with the intention of obstructing foreign shipping. Various foreign shipping companies will request their respective consuls to negotiate in order to maintain shipping.</p>
<p>Resumption of the Shanghai-Taizhou Route Needs to be Awaited: After the Wenzhou-Taizhou Defense Commander approved the request of shipping companies to allow ships to anchor at Sanjiangkou to load and unload passengers and cargo, the Marler ship managed by the Ningbo-Shaoxing Company tried sailing once and was quite satisfied. The Golden ship, which operates on the Ningbo-Taizhou route, is also preparing to resume shipping. Therefore, the resumption of the Shanghai-Taizhou route is of great concern to all sectors. Sanjiangkou is located in a remote area, and passenger and cargo transportation is sluggish. The ships do not intend to resume shipping for the time being. Therefore, the resumption of the Shanghai-Taizhou route will have to be awaited. As for the Ningbo-Taizhou route, it will resume shipping first.</p>
<p>Dinghai Temporarily Resumes Shipping for Fish Loading: In order to consolidate the defenses of various small ports along the coast, the Zhejiang authorities prohibited ships from docking in Dinghai. The Shanghai-Dinghai route has been suspended for a long time. Now, local fishermen and merchants, in order to transport fresh fish, have submitted a request to the authorities to hire the Hana Hayford as a dedicated ship for transporting fish directly to Shanghai, but ships traveling from Shanghai must transit through Ningbo and Bay, and the carrying of passengers is strictly prohibited. It is learned that the Hana is scheduled to depart from Dinghai for Shanghai for the first time on the 20th (Monday) to load fish, but this resumption of shipping is still temporary in nature.</p>

<h3>The New Japanese Traffic Regulations, Not Valued By The Municipal Council, Seemingly Will Order Police To Obey, Except For Japanese Nationals, Not Bound By Them</h3>
<p>The "Continental Daily" reports that regarding the implementation of the new traffic regulations by the Japanese side in the area north of the Suzhou Creek, the Shanghai Municipal Council is still in the process of taking formal action. Although officials acknowledged yesterday (the 16th) that the implementation of the traffic regulations stipulated by the Japanese Naval Landing Force has slightly undermined the administrative integrity of the Public Concession, judging from the phenomena last night, the Council seemed to be ordering the Public Concession police to abide by these rules. When reporters asked several members of the Council about this matter yesterday, they</p>
<p>Attempted To Reduce The Importance Of This Matter. It was claimed that the commander of a certain foreign military district, if he believes that expanding its rules is necessary to better protect life and property in the district, it seems to be a legitimate action. However, officials have not yet issued any statements or intentions. The Council only received the new regulations submitted by the Japanese side on Tuesday. The Japanese Landing Force authorities</p>
<p>Did Not Await The Council's Reply, and announced the regulations the next day, stating that they would be implemented from Tuesday, the 14th of this month. It is said that the Council is still considering these new traffic regulations. According to one Council member, the Council will consider whether these regulations are implemented by the Council or by other authorities, as it would harm the integrity of the Public Concession. It is also claimed that without the approval of the Public Concession Police Department and the foreign consulates, the implementation of these new regulations, except for</p>
<p>Japanese Nationals, Will Not Affect Other Foreign Nationals. For example, any foreigner other than a Japanese national who enjoys extraterritoriality, if he violates one of these new regulations, will be accused of violating the traffic regulations to his consular authorities. However, if the consular court does not recognize the legal right of the Japanese Landing Force to amend the rules, the charges against the foreigner will be automatically dropped. Chinese and foreigners who do not enjoy extraterritoriality and violate the regulations will be dealt with by the Special Court No. 1, as the Special Court No. 1 is the only court in the Public Concession</p>
<p>With The Power To Govern Them. Unless the Special Court No. 1 recognizes the Japanese regulations, we will not punish violators. It is said that the Council may put pressure on the Special Court No. 1, but the Council has no power to influence the courts of foreign consulates. Therefore, if the Special Court No. 1 implements these regulations for some reason, the result will be unfair discrimination, favoring foreigners who enjoy extraterritoriality. According to the Japanese regulations, there is no significant difference from the regulations of the Police Department, except for the addition of prohibitions on smoking while driving, vehicle speed, parking locations, etc.</p>
<h3>Temporary Supplementary Measures for the Levy of Profit-Seeking Enterprise Income Tax in War Zones, First Levied on Branches in Non-Occupied War Zones, But Those with Huge Losses May Be Granted Deferred Levy After Proof</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has announced the following temporary supplementary measures for the levy of the first category (profit-seeking enterprise income tax): (1) For profit-seeking enterprises with branches in war zones, if the capital and the head office are not clearly separated and the income can actually be calculated together, it should still be calculated together. (2) If the above-mentioned profit-seeking enterprises cannot calculate their income together due to road obstruction, loss of books, etc., the income of the head office and branches not in war zones should be calculated together first. (3) If all the branches are in war zones and cannot be calculated together, the income of the head office not in war zones should be calculated separately first. (4) If the head office is in a war zone and cannot be calculated together, the income of each branch not in war zones should be calculated separately first. (5) According to the second and third items, the head office outside the war zone should deduct the funds allocated to the branches in the war zone from the original capital amount, and the remaining amount should be the capital amount, and the tax should be levied according to the tax rate in Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations. (6) According to the fourth item, the income of each branch outside the war zone calculated separately should be taxed according to the tax rate in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations. (7) According to the fourth item, the income of each branch outside the war zone calculated separately should be taxed according to the tax rate in Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations. (8) Even if the business calculated separately according to the previous third and fourth items has a surplus, but the branches or head office in the war zone have suffered substantial losses, they may submit sufficient proof to the competent tax collection authority for approval to defer the levy. (9) For those who calculate and levy taxes according to the previous second, third, and fourth items, after the war is over, they should be combined with the branches or head office that were in the war zone to calculate the tax, and refunds should be made separately. (10) Each office should prepare a separate registration book for profit-seeking enterprises that are levied taxes according to the previous second, third, and fourth items for future reference when handling tax refunds.</p>
<h3>The Pseudo "Reformed Government" Handles Transit Taxes: The Taxes are Very High, and Public Grievances are Boiling</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun, the "Reformed Government" established a transit tax earlier this month. This move can achieve two benefits: one is that various daily necessities will not be transported from the provinces under the jurisdiction of the "Reformed Government" to other places, and the other is that the "Reformed Government" can obtain a monthly tax revenue of 1.2 million yuan for relief purposes. Various goods, such as leather, livestock, rice, wheat, other cotton, eggs, and raw silk, are subject to a special price tax of 5% to 20%. Because the "Reformed Government" has a large shortage of daily necessities due to the transportation of goods produced in its jurisdiction to other ports, it has closed all ports along the Yangtze River except for 14 (including Jiangyin, Tianshenggang, Hupu, Fushan, and Bawugang), and dispatched "Pacification Teams," police, and the Japanese army to prevent smuggling in the ports.</p>
<h3>American Asiatic Fleet - Change of Command - Rear Admiral Hottle to Succeed</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Yarnell, commander of the American Asiatic Fleet, returned to the United States from Shanghai last month. His position had remained vacant until now.

Hottle is expected to arrive in Shanghai at the end of May or early June of this year. Hottle served as an adjutant in the American Asiatic Fleet from 1920 to 1922. He participated in the Spanish-American War, and also made distinguished contributions during World War I. He was promoted to his current position in 1929. This is Hottle's first time coming to China.</p>

<h3>Foreign Minister of the Puppet "Reformed Government" - Wang Yintai to Succeed - Wang Practiced Law in Shanghai for Years</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that after the assassination of Chen Lu at his residence in Shanghai, the position of Foreign Minister of the puppet "Reformed Government" was left vacant. It was learned yesterday (the 16th) that Wang Yintai, who until recently was a partner in a law firm in Shanghai, has been appointed as the Foreign Minister of the puppet "Reformed Government". Wang has been involved in politics for a long time. He studied law in Germany in 1909 and returned to China in 1913. He held important positions in the Beijing government and served as an advisor to Zhang Zuolin in 1922. In 1926, he served as Minister of Justice. From 1930, he practiced law in Shanghai, with his office located at 212 Jiangxi Road.</p>
<h3>Second Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week - Today is Women's Propaganda Day - Eight Instructions for Female Compatriots - Various Women's Organizations Issue Open Letter to Female Compatriots</h3>
<p>Today is the Women's Propaganda Day of the Anti-Japanese War Propaganda Week, led by the Shanghai Special City Party Headquarters. Shanghai women's organizations have jointly issued an open letter to female compatriots of this city, pointing out the close relationship between the anti-Japanese reconstruction effort and the liberation of women in detail, and listing eight tasks that female compatriots should strive for in the future. They are reproduced below:</p>
<p>Female compatriots of this city, now is the true opportunity for us women to seek liberation and fight for equality. Madame Chiang Soong Mei-ling instructs us, "We must recognize that women's liberation should not be viewed simply as a right, but as a responsibility. Why do we seek women's liberation? It is to fulfill our responsibilities as women. In other words, if we truly want to achieve women's liberation, we must first be able to shoulder responsibilities." This is truly a profound and insightful saying, a guiding principle for the women's liberation movement.</p>
<p>In Madame Chiang's words, the errors of our past women's liberation movement are implicitly pointed out. In the past, we only competed with men for equality in rights, such as women's economic independence, equal education, and women's suffrage. We focused on reclaiming the rights that men had solely controlled. What was the result of this movement after a long period of struggle? Wasn't it just a superficial victory? Although women can now participate in social activities, inherit property, seek employment, pursue education, and engage in politics just like men, the fundamental power remains in the hands of men, as in the past. The superficial victory we have achieved has only become an adornment and decoration for the male-dominated society. It is not that we women do not know how to strive or are unwilling to improve, but the forces of history and society are too strong. The male-dominated society has deep-rooted and long-standing traditions not only in our country but throughout the world. It is truly difficult to fundamentally overthrow the social structure that has been gradually built up since history and achieve true equality between men and women, no matter how hard we try, with our fragile and nascent power. The only hope is to seize the opportunity of history. When the entire nation and country undergo a great revolution, we should bravely rise up and strive to create great achievements in history, demonstrate the powerful strength we can contribute to the country, and not let men take all the credit. Then our women's liberation movement will naturally be thoroughly successful and realized in the leap forward of the times.</p>
<p>The current stage is a golden opportunity for us women to seek liberation and fight for equality. Our country and our nation are at a critical juncture of survival under the invasion and attack of violent enemies. After twenty months of bloody resistance, the fate of our country and nation has turned from a dangerous situation to the road of revival. Our desire for women's liberation and equality can be promoted and realized in this sacred and great era. Therefore, Madame Chiang instructs us, "We must use the power of our women to achieve the liberation of the entire nation and fulfill our responsibilities." This tells us that in the current work of seeking the liberation of the entire nation, our female compatriots should shoulder the same responsibilities as men. When the liberation of the entire nation is achieved, the liberation of our women will naturally follow. Dear sisters, in this second stage of the War of Resistance, we should not let men bear the arduous responsibilities alone. We should follow Madame Chiang's instructions and take on the following missions: (1) Promote thrift; (2) Encourage production; (3) Promote social education; (4) Manage relief efforts; (5) Encourage young men to enlist; (6) Assist in anti-Japanese propaganda; (7) Comfort and assist the families of soldiers going to war; (8) Assist the families of soldiers going to war, organize small crafts, impart agricultural technology, and establish cooperatives.</p>
<h3>Chinese Aircraft Bomb Japanese Ships in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River - Escorting Japanese Ship also Heavily Damaged - Remaining Ship Turns Back and Flees to Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to sources, two Japanese transport ships, the "Phoenix Sun Maru" and the "Daikichi Maru," loaded large quantities of provisions at the Mitsubishi Wharf and the China Merchants North Wharf in Hongkou on the 8th of this month. They sailed out of Songkou together, heading up the Yangtze River to Wuhan to resupply the Japanese troops trapped in central Hubei. A Japanese warship accompanied them for protection. Between the 12th and 13th, as they were sailing on the river between Nanjing and Jiujiang, they suddenly encountered two brave Chinese aircraft, which bombed them. The "Phoenix Sun Maru" was faster and carried more cargo than the "Daikichi Maru," so it was several tens of miles ahead. The Japanese warship followed closely. The Chinese aircraft engaged in a fierce air-sea battle. The Chinese pilots were skilled and maneuvered freely, accurately dropping bombs on the Japanese warship and the "Phoenix Sun Maru." The "Phoenix Sun Maru" was sunk to the bottom of the river. The Japanese warship was also heavily damaged. Seeing the situation was unfavorable, the "Daikichi Maru" quickly turned around and fled downstream, unloading the provisions in Nanjing. The empty ship returned to Shanghai on the 15th. It is reported that the sunk "Phoenix Sun Maru" was originally a Yangtze River liner of the Japanese Nisshin Company. After the war, it was requisitioned by the Japanese Navy and converted into a transport ship with a displacement of several thousand tons.</p>
<h3>Ding Xueshan's Troops Inflict Heavy Blow on Puppet Troops in Songjiang</h3>
<p>The puppet troops in Songjiang, belonging to Xu Pucheng's "Jiangsu-Zhejiang Pacification Army," were suddenly attacked by Ding Xueshan's guerrilla troops, who were ambushing along the railway line, the night before last (the 15th). During the fierce battle between the two sides, Xu Pucheng disguised himself and fled far away with his entourage. The puppet troops had no fighting spirit and were easily defeated after this major change. They all abandoned their weapons and fled. In this battle, Ding's troops captured a large number of light and heavy weapons and took control of the four suburbs of Songjiang.</p>
<h3>Li Zhiming's Troops Inflict Heavy Casualties on Japanese Troops in Fengxian - Fierce Battles at Tai Ri Bridge and Qingcun Port - Most Japanese Troops Retreat to Lujiahui</h3>
<p>Five days ago, when more than 200 Japanese and puppet troops invaded Qianjiaqiao in Pudong, they were bravely resisted by Li Zhiming's Fourth Brigade of the Loyal Salvation National Army, led personally by the battalion commander Chuan Shengchang, with a machine gun squad and the 10th, 11th, 12th, and 13th companies. After more than an hour of fierce fighting, the Fifth Brigade also arrived one after another and took up an encirclement formation, launching a fierce attack on the Japanese troops.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops were tied up front and back, and fearing their rear would be cut off, they retreated in defeat towards Nanqiao. In this battle, nine Japanese soldiers were killed and more than ten were wounded. At 9:15 AM the next morning, the Japanese troops mobilized more than 400 Japanese and puppet troops from Zhoupu and Xinchang and launched a fierce attack on the Tai Ri Bridge command post in three routes. Commander Li Zhiming personally led the Special Service Battalion to meet the enemy near Tai Ri Bridge. After two hours of fierce fighting, both sides</p>
<p>suffered casualties. Ultimately, due to the intense Japanese artillery fire, Li retreated to a new position to avoid excessive sacrifices. He then mobilized his strong forces to launch a counterattack on Tai Ri Bridge at noon. Fearing Li's miraculous use of troops, the Japanese troops set fire to more than a dozen civilian houses, killing and wounding more than a dozen civilians, and retreated towards Lujiahui. At 2 PM on the same afternoon, the Japanese troops again drew more than 200 troops from Nanqiao to</p>
<p>attack Qingcun Port. Li's First Brigade, led by Lu Zhiyang, bravely repelled them. The Japanese troops then fled to Fengxian city, where they were ambushed by Li's Third Brigade. In this battle, the enemy suffered heavy casualties and retreated towards Nanqiao.</p>

<h3>Raising Funds for Vocational Training Center - One Yuan Fund Campaign - Donations are Very Enthusiastic</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center has been in operation for over a year, establishing ten workshops including carpentry, toy making, embroidery, laundry, towel bleaching and dyeing, soap making, glove making, paper box making, and printing. According to the planned schedule, it is progressing step by step. It has been filed with the National Government Relief Committee and has been inspected and commended by special commissioners. However, due to the lack of a fixed fund, all expenses are stretched thin. Therefore, a One Yuan Fund Campaign Committee has been formed to request assistance from all sectors of society, hoping to pool the strength of the community and benefit the refugees. In recent days, copperplate engravings showing the current state of the center and donation forms with announcements from the One Yuan Fund Campaign Committee have been sent to major commercial firms. Since the start of the fundraising campaign, it has received strong support from all sectors, and donations have been very enthusiastic.</p>

<h3>Guerrillas Warn Gambling Dens - Gamblers Tread Carefully, Fearing Accidents</h3>
<p>The guerrillas are currently extremely disgusted with the depraved gambling dens and opium dens. All opium businesses have completely closed their doors. The delivery of opium, which used to be done regularly, has been temporarily suspended. As for well-known gambling dens such as Hollywood, Rongsheng Company, Liusheng Company, and Guangsheng Company, they have received warnings and bombs for several consecutive days, ordering them to close within three days, or they will be destroyed by a large number of bombs, regardless of the innocent. The gambling dens again received phone calls the day before yesterday, which were the guerrillas urging them to close down. Therefore, the owners have stopped going, and a group of gamblers are also treading carefully and refraining from going.</p>
<h3>Police Department Raids Bookstores</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Road in the Public Concession, between Fujian Road and Qipan Street (Henan Road), has always been a concentrated location for bookstores.

It was learned at the time that the Labour Bureau's Political Department, together with the Police Department, dispatched patrol officers to carry out the operation. All the bookstores were thoroughly searched, and all kinds of books and texts listed as suspected of being communist, anti-Japanese, or obscene were confiscated, leaving none behind.

<h3>White Russian Sentenced to Five Years for Helping Japanese Sell Drugs</h3>
<p>Huang Zhanglin Sentenced to Two and a Half Years</p>

The main criminals, Japanese and Korean people, all escaped. Only two accomplices, the White Russian Magoloff and the Chinese Huang Zhanglin, were arrested, along with the morphine, and taken back to the police station for investigation and sent to the Second Special Court for prosecution according to law. Judge Zhang Minsheng held a hearing and ordered them to be detained pending judgment. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Li Shengzuo took the bench in the First Criminal Court and sentenced Magoloff to five years of imprisonment for helping others sell drugs. Huang Zhanglin was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for helping others sell drugs. The confiscated drugs were confiscated according to the list.</p>
<h3>Two Thieves Arrested at Dahua Hotel Last Night</h3>

As a result, two thieves were arrested in the hotel and taken back to the Old Gate Police Station for interrogation and detention.</p>

He was shot by the guerrillas near Bridge No. 3 on the Shanghai-Minhang Road, severely</p>
<p>injured in a vital area, and died on the spot.</p>
<h3>Rampant Gambling in Caohejing</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese occupied the various towns and villages belonging to the Caohejing area in the western suburbs of Shanghai, such as Changqiao and Zhujiaxing, they have allowed and poisoned people with opium, gambling, and white powder. As a result, disputes and mutual</p>
<p>accusations have been frequently heard. Since the beginning of the lunar year, the Caohejing town maintenance association has communicated and contacted various parties, and has publicly engaged in rampant gambling. The sounds of shouting and cheering can be heard day and night. The amount of money won and lost is surprisingly large.</p>
<p>Local merchants and farmers, tempted by profit, have fallen into the trap, willing to spend their hard-earned money in a single gamble. Recently, those engaged in the gambling business and local ruffians have all become wealthy and live extravagantly, while the surrounding villagers who have failed are frowning, making the difference between the two sides like heaven and earth.</p>
<h3>Clerk of Customs Brokerage Sentenced for Embezzlement</h3>

<h3>Uncle Sentenced to One Year for Trafficking Nephew</h3>
<p>Zou Qinshi, a 34-year-old woman from Pudong, was admitted to the hospital to give birth in early January of this year. Because her five-year-old son, Mao Tou, was left unattended at home, she entrusted Mao Tou to her sister Zhou Zoushi at No. 54, Yuchang Lane, Caishi Road, French Concession. Unexpectedly, on the 27th of the same month, Qinshi's husband's younger brother, Zou Baisheng, abducted Mao Tou and sold him to Zhao Xushi (30 years old), a Shanghai woman at No. 16, Route Cardinal Mercier, as an adopted son, obtaining 33 yuan which he spent. After Qinshi was discharged from the hospital after her month of confinement, she repeatedly inquired and learned that her beloved son had been abducted and sold by her younger uncle. She reported to the French Police a few days ago, and Zou Baisheng was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation. The child was also retrieved and returned. All the details have been recorded in this newspaper.

<h3>Sales in the Interior Increasing Daily</h3>
<p>Eighth Issue, Prize Drawing on April 5th</p>
<p>The eighth issue of the French Merchant's Charity Lottery for Relief of Refugees will be drawn publicly at the Yiyuan in Shanghai on April 5th, rain or shine.

<h3>Wuzhou Pharmacy Specially Made Double-Concentrated Disinfectant</h3>
<p>Customers Must Order Early</p>
<p>As the weather turns warmer, epidemics are expected to become prevalent and should be prevented early. Yalin Disinfectant made by Wuzhou Pharmacy is a necessary product for epidemic prevention and protection. Large quantities are sold every year. Due to the shortage of raw materials and soaring freight costs, the company, in order to take care of the convenience of customers, has adopted the best raw materials and carefully manufactured double-concentrated disinfectant. The ingredients are extremely concentrated, the sterilization power is strong, and freight costs are saved. It can be used as one to two. The price is kept low. However, customers must order early to avoid being unable to produce in time.</p>
<h3>Rice Shops Secretly Raise Prices</h3>
<p>Argument Occurs and a Request is Made for Prevention</p>
<p>The price of rice in this city is gradually increasing. The seven rice and bean guilds have each elected representatives to form a Rice and Grain Evaluation Committee, limiting the price of top-quality white rice to no more than 14 yuan per stone. However, the rice shops still hoard their goods and secretly raise prices, selling second-class white rice as the highest-quality top-grade white japonica rice. Yesterday morning, the number one white japonica rice at the Santai Rice Shop on Avenue Joffre was sold for 14 yuan and 20 cents, exceeding the limited price. Customers questioned the shop, asking why it was violating the limited price. The shop insisted that the 14 yuan was a limit set by the industry, not by the shop. An argument ensued. The customer believes that while increasing the price by 20 cents per stone is a small matter, violating the resolution is a big matter. A letter has now been sent to the Rice and Bean Guild, asking for an investigation and prevention of the secret raising of market prices.</p>
<h3>Sino-British Pharmacy West District Branch</h3>
<p>Sino-British Pharmacy, in order to facilitate people in the west district, has established a branch at the corner of Bubbling Well Road and Hardoon Road, selling new European and American drugs, high-end tonics, various good medicines of this brand, as well as cosmetics and fragrances.

Customers from all walks of life are taking advantage of this rare opportunity to purchase, and business is booming.</p>
<h3>Driver Who Crushed Two to Death Appeals for Leniency</h3>
<p>Sentence Increased to Three Years Imprisonment and 300 Yuan Fine</p>
<p>Wang Jinfang, a 27-year-old from Yancheng, was a driver for the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, driving bus number 47. At 9:10 AM on December 16th of last year, he was driving a bus on Avenue Edward VII, heading west, at the corner of Rue de Baron Gros. The driver carelessly drove onto the sidewalk. In front of number 593, he knocked down a pedestrian, Zhang Miaorong, a 17-year-old from Tongzhou, and crushed him to death on the spot. In a panic, he did not brake and drove to number 607, where he knocked down a laborer, Zhang Guoren (42 years old), and crushed his head to death. The French Police arrested Wang Jinfang and sent him to the Second Special Court, where he was prosecuted for causing death due to negligence in his profession. As a result of the preliminary trial, Wang Jinfang was sentenced to two years of imprisonment. Wang was dissatisfied with the original verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. The collegiate bench has concluded its hearing and scheduled a date for sentencing. At 2:30 PM yesterday afternoon, the</p>
<p>presiding judge and the judges opened the court and sentenced Wang Jinfang to three years of imprisonment and</p>
<p>a fine of 300 yuan. If he is to commute his sentence by labor, it will be calculated at one</p>
<p>day for one</p>
<p>yuan.</p>
<p>The court ordered Wang to be returned to the detention center. It is said that Wang was dissatisfied with this heavier sentence and plans to appeal to the Supreme Court again.</p>

<h3>Gambling Den Traitors Assault and Insult Chinese Police Officer Sentenced to Seven Months Imprisonment Each</h3>
<p>Li Pinquan from Nanjing, formerly serving in the Municipal Public Security Bureau, after the fall of Shanghai, relied on the special forces in the western part of Shanghai, gathered his accomplices, and opened a "Guangsheng Company" gambling den in a lane on Bailinan Road outside the concession police jurisdiction. For several months, the profits from the commission, after deducting the protection fees, were substantial. On the 14th of this month, because a</p>
<p>sedan car temporarily stopped at the entrance of the lane, Li caught sight of it and, considering it an obstruction to the entry and exit of cars carrying gamblers to and from the gambling den, immediately summoned Wu Xiufeng, a bouncer in the den, to make trouble for the chauffeur. Chinese Police Officer No. 2549, stationed on Bailinan Road by the Jing'an Temple Police Station, saw this and tried to stop them. Unexpectedly, Li and Wu, relying on their protective charm, wanted to</p>
<p>forcibly drag the police officer into the lane to act violently. The police officer then fired a warning shot in self-defense. Officers from the neighboring post heard the sound and rushed over, cooperating to arrest Li and Wu. Although Chinese and Western detectives from the jurisdiction police station later found that Li had committed robbery and murder in the western district in recent years, the locations of the incidents were all outside the concession, and there was no need to overstep their authority. Therefore, only regarding the</p>
<p>assault and battery of the Chinese police officer, a public prosecution was filed with the First Special District Local Court. After Judge Dai Rongduo repeatedly investigated and clarified the matter, yesterday morning was the day for the verdict. The detectives escorted the two criminals, Li Pinquan (also known as Li Wu) and Wu Xiufeng, to the Eighth Criminal Court. Police station lawyer Qian Xunjiu and the defendants' defense lawyers also arrived in court one after another. Soon, Judge Dai took the bench and</p>
<p>sentenced Li and Wu to seven months of imprisonment. The defendants' lawyers immediately requested bail during the appeal period, but the court determined that the crimes committed by the two criminals were serious and difficult to approve, rejecting their request. They then ordered the detectives to escort them back to the police station for strict detention, pending final judgment and imprisonment.</p>

<p>Strict Security at the Conference Venue: The conference venue was newly whitewashed, and colorful slogans were posted around it. The educational purpose written on white silk was hung at the top of the conference stage, and the banner of the "Third National Education Conference" was hung under the white silk, with yellow background, black characters, and black borders, which was brilliant and dazzling. The security at the conference venue was strict. Only those wearing the "Education" badge of plum petals and blue silk badges were allowed to enter and exit freely. Guests used red badges to distinguish them.</p>
<p>Chairman's Opening Address and Officials' Instructions: After the rituals were performed, (1) Chen Lifu delivered the opening speech first; (2) after three minutes of silent prayer, Chen's speech mainly stated that this conference focused on discussing the implementation plan of today's education, and special attention should be paid to the spiritual aspect; (2) President Chiang delivered instructions on behalf of Zhang Qun. The words were sincere, and the main points were: 1. Education should be cultivated as a scientific foundation; 2. Education should assist politics; (3) Chairman Lin of the National Government sent instructions on behalf of Zhang Ji, and the entire speech was inseparable from the "respect for teachers"; (4) President Kong requested the education sector to do the following six things: first, the education of noble character; second, the education of healthy physique; third, the education of practical common sense; fourth, the education of production skills; fifth, the education of specialized knowledge; sixth, the education of the spirit of sacrifice. He especially advocated that teachers should set an example and advised educators to enrich the content first and not build magnificent school buildings first.

However, there were only two speakers, (1) Ju Zheng gave a speech praising the conference, (2) Zeng Qi advocated respecting teachers and the way of teachers, and lamented how education can save rampant individualism.</p>
<p>Photography and Visits After the Opening Ceremony: The bell rang at 11:00, and the conference announced the end of the ceremony. Everyone went to the head of the education department to take pictures, and then visited the Education Reference Room. The chairman took the lead, and the crowd followed. There were six reference rooms, (1) National Normal University Labor Practice Specialization Exhibition Room, (2) Elementary Education Room, (3) Vocational School Room, (4) Secondary School Normal School Room, (5) Higher Education Room, (6) Social Education and Sports Hygiene Room. Among them, the most admirable and valuable for research was Dr. Ai Wei, a professor at Central University, and his research on Chinese character psychology. One of his tables was named "Number of Characters Recognized by Primary and Secondary School Students." The results of Ai's research are as follows: (1) Elementary school (A) The number of characters recognized in the first semester of the fifth grade is 4070, 4571 in the second semester of the fifth grade, 5113 in the first semester of the sixth grade, and 5607 in the second semester of the sixth grade; (2) Junior high school, 6498 in the second semester of the first grade, 7023 in the second semester of the second grade, and 7376 in the second semester of the third grade; High school, 7616 in the second semester of the first grade, 7669 in the second semester of the second grade, and 7815 in the second semester of the third grade.

The directors and principals suddenly changed to student life. After lunch that day, there was a three-hour rest, followed by a preparatory meeting. Chairman Chen was unwell and had a fever in the afternoon, but he still worked hard and served as chairman while sick. First, Zhang Daofan (Deputy Minister of Education), Secretary-General of the Conference, read out the organizational regulations of the Third National Education Conference, the conference review rules, and the conference rules of procedure. All regulations were passed by the plenary meeting. The meeting was originally to have one chairman and two vice chairmen.

As a result of the vote, Jiang Menglin won 43 votes and was elected. Next, the candidates for the review committees were determined.

<h3>General Assembly Held on the Second Day</h3>
<p>March 2nd was the second day of the Third National Education Conference. Many newspapers in Chongqing had editorials and published news with special headlines. The morning from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM was for education reports, and the afternoon was for group review. This was the agenda for the second day.</p>
<p>First General Assembly Representatives Report: The first general assembly was an education report. The chairman was Vice Chairman Gu Yuxiu. Each report was limited to ten minutes. A bell rang to notify them at eight minutes. The materials brought by the representatives were very rich, and it was not easy to allocate the materials they wanted to say in ten minutes. However, there were a total of twelve institutions reporting, and each institution took ten minutes, which already took 720 minutes, a total of twelve hours. The time occupied by the meeting was already considerable. The first reporter was National Central University, the second was Nanjing Social Bureau, the third was Private Jinling University, the fourth was National Southwest Associated University, the fifth was Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education (because Zhou Fohai left with Wang Jingwei and did not attend, there was no report), the sixth was Private Fudan University, the seventh was National Zhongshan University, the eighth was Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, the ninth was Private Daxia University, the tenth was National Northwest Associated University, the eleventh was Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau, the twelfth was Private Lingnan University, the thirteenth was National Wuhan University, the fourteenth was Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, the fifteenth was Private Soochow University, the sixteenth was National Sichuan University, the seventeenth was Shandong Provincial Department of Education, the eighteenth was Private Guanghua University, the nineteenth was National Hunan University, the twentieth was Hubei Provincial Department of Education.

<p>200 Proposals Reviewed by Eight Groups: The group review was originally scheduled from 3:00 PM to 6:00 PM. There were more than 200 external proposals, and the Ministry of Education also proposed eight major proposals, which were two inches thick. In reality, the time was very limited. There were eight review groups in eight review rooms. Each room had simple and elegant arrangements. Chongqing peach blossoms had already bloomed, so each room was filled with peach blossoms, plum blossoms, and pear blossoms, with red and white colors complementing each other, which could greatly adjust the spirits of the reviewers and was conducive to mental health.

<p>The New Life Movement Exhibition is Meaningful: At dusk, with thousands of lights on, it was reported that it was past 6:00 PM. Each member took the cars of the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Education to visit the fifth anniversary exhibition of the New Life Movement. Concrete exhibitions of various aspects of life, such as diet and living, were presented. Various utensils such as kitchens and bathrooms were both hygienic and cost-effective, and were all made in China. There were also simple devices to prevent rats from gnawing on things, which were said to be excellent and wonderful, and could be applied in the inland areas of our country. The method is to add a movable hard board in the middle of the rope for hanging objects. Rats must pass through the hard board to get food, and the hard board moves, and the rat falls to the ground. Also, the food cabinet is nailed to the wall, about half a foot from the wall. The four corners leaning against the wall are made of lead skin into a liter shape to prevent rats from entering the cabinet. This can be called "home economics education" and can also be taught in conjunction with "labor practice."</p>
<p>The exhibition in the last room was "Songgui in the Construction of Economic Fortresses." In addition, the New Life Women's Guidance Committee ran production projects in Songgui Township, Chongqing. The person in charge was the social educator Ms. Yu Qingtang. The items displayed in the room were (1) improved silk industry. It is said that no waste is discarded from a silkworm pupa from beginning to end. It can still be used to make soap and soy sauce; (2) Angora rabbit wool products. A rabbit wool spinning wheel has also been invented, costing only ten foreign dollars per frame, and the villagers can use it within two weeks; (3) mass-produced gauze; (4) improved big oranges. This kind of orange is larger than American oranges; (5) improved orange juice; (6) valuable pig bristles; (7) improved eggs; (8) hemp-made artificial cotton; (9) military blankets woven from cow and sheep wool; (10) velvet ropes; (11) embroidered summer cloth. All of these make use of local products and are used domestically and abroad. Silk and pig bristles have reached export standards. From now on, Sichuan will have a large amount of export goods. According to Ms. Yu, the time is very short, and the foundation is all laid on mass education, so the villagers are willing to participate and run cooperatives and training courses to seek welfare for the people.</p>
<p>Kong and Zhang Host a Simple and Hygienic Feast: After visiting the New Life Movement Exhibition, the members attended a banquet hosted by President Kong Xiangxi and Vice President Zhang Qun of the Executive Yuan. The dinner was held at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 8:00 PM. This kind of banquet was different from usual, because it was a New Life banquet. Each person only had a bowl of soup and a bowl of vegetables. The vegetable bowl was divided into four compartments, containing (1) a slice of fish and an egg, (2) peas and fried meat slices, (3) bamboo shoots braised in meat, (4) vegetables. It was nutritious and hygienic, and the price was only four or five jiao. Compared with the extravagance of the past, the difference cannot be measured by distance.</p>
<p>Chiang's Reply Encourages Education and Resistance: After the meal, fruit was served. During the banquet, the two hosts, Kong and Zhang, gave humorous speeches. Jiang Menglin replied on behalf of all the members, mainly thanking the authorities for allocating funds to maintain education and said that Chinese education in the past has not failed, because today women and children in remote rural areas all know how to sing passionate songs, and the 400 million people in the country are of one mind. Extraordinary education is carried out by aviation schools and military academies, and ordinary education is carried out by us. Extraordinary education must be based on ordinary education. In short, there has never been a magical sudden change in education in the world, and it must come gradually. This meeting will not have any new tricks. Finally, Ma Shouyi performed ten sets of magic tricks, and then the meeting adjourned at 10:00 PM.</p>

<h3>Today's Grand Football Match: Lido vs. Western District Police Fight for the Scott Cup</h3>
<p>The showdown is at 2:30 PM at the Recreation Ground. Both sides have their strengths, making the outcome difficult to predict.</p>
<p>The Scott Cup football competition, featuring twelve strong Chinese and Western teams, has reached its final stage. Lido and the Western District Police will compete for the championship today at 2:30 PM at the Recreation Ground. Lido easily defeated Lox and powerfully overcame St. Francis. The Western District Police, on the other hand, consecutively defeated Portugal, the Jewish Association, and Eastern Selle, thus earning the right to the finals. With Zhang Xueyao leaving Shanghai, Lido's internal defense is weakened. They have decided to transfer Sun Jinshun to guard the rear, which should compensate for Zhang Lin'gen's absence. The forwards are talented, so the relocation of Sun will not diminish their sharpness. Western District Police's goalkeeper, Willie Walter, possesses excellent technique, unmatched in Shanghai. Defenders Turner and Victor are steady, and the center line boasts the fierce Huishute and the experienced Jebson. Therefore, in terms of strength, Lido excels in offense over defense, while the Western District Police excels in defense over offense. A fierce battle is expected. Since the cup's inception in 1902, Chinese teams have only won twice, both times by the Shandong Chinese Association. All other times, it has been won by foreign teams. This time, Lido will surely follow in the footsteps of the Donghua Association and win supreme glory for the Chinese people. The Zi Lin Cup final, featuring the French Army versus British American Tobacco, will take place at 3:00 PM at the Racecourse. In the Group A first round, Aurora University faces Eastern Selle, with little chance of success. The schedule for today is listed below:</p>

<h3>"Symbol of Melancholy"</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Kuwahara Shiroko says that art is a symbol of melancholy; I say that war is also a symbol of melancholy.</p>
<p>An artist has feelings but no way to vent them, suffering from melancholy. He has no choice but to entrust his passion to art. Thus, the pent-up feelings in his chest can be released without reservation, and he can continue to live. As for whether his art will be valued by contemporaries or passed on to future generations, he does not ask. However, such art is often valued by contemporaries and is indeed able to be passed on to future generations.</p>
<p>Similarly, an oppressed people, having already yielded and retreated repeatedly, suffers from unspeakable melancholy. But the oppressor is still insatiable and oppresses endlessly. Thus, they have no other choice but to rise up in resistance and strike back at the oppressors. In the heat of the moment, they may even focus on venting their anger, regardless of the risk of success or failure. However, such wars are often able to win victory, thus shaking off the shackles and achieving independence and freedom.</p>
<p>In the former case, it is what is called "poverty breeds art," and in the latter case, it is of course "adversity builds a nation." There are countless examples of artists who became skilled after experiencing poverty, and nations that were built through adversity can also be pointed out one by one. Recently, our country has encountered oppression from the enemy, and thus the whole country has united. The second phase of the war of resistance has begun, and thus victory has a certain chance of success. These are all clear proofs that adversity builds a nation, and they are also symbols of melancholy, which, like art, have become beautiful fruits for people to appreciate.</p>
<p>However, we know that melancholy is not only seen in artists but also in those who are keen on fame and gain; not only in the oppressed but also in the oppressors. Why is it that artists and the oppressed ultimately achieve something, while those who are keen on fame and gain and the oppressors, if they do not achieve nothing, then they achieve something but are despised by people and scolded by future generations? There is no other reason for this. The former's motivation is pure, peaceful, and in accordance with justice, so they are said to have the support of those who possess the Way. The latter's motivation is base, violent, and contrary to justice, so they are said to have little support from those who lose the Way. Although the melancholy in emotions is the same, the causes and consequences are very different.</p>
<p>Our enemies have the melancholy of the oppressors. The symbol of their melancholy is, of course, war. However, since launching the war, their melancholy has not only failed to be reduced but has instead increased. Now, they can neither advance nor retreat, and they are deeply trapped in the mire. The manifestation of their melancholy can be seen everywhere. Of course, they can absolutely not achieve anything, and being scolded by future generations has already become an ironclad case like a mountain.</p>
<p>Their battles in northern Jiangsu and central Hubei, as well as the indiscriminate bombing and shelling in various places, I once said were boring acts, calling them "reimbursement wars." Now, I can also say that these are their "symbols of melancholy"!</p>
<h3>Crossing the River</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>In the evening, the night gradually spread out in the sky, shrouding the earth like a layer of black gauze. It was also like dust stirred up by the wind, so vast and pervasive that it obscured the fields and villages and blurred the vast river surface.</p>
<p>The muddy yellow river water, beautified by the twilight, unexpectedly gave us many conveniences from the haze. Crossing the river in a haze, we stepped into the territory occupied by demons. A sudden and urgent hope floated in our minds: drive out the invaders and protect the river!</p>
<p>A team of brothers rushed down the embankment, quickly climbed onto a small boat, untied the cable, and pushed off with a pole. The river water was agitated by the boat, and waves suddenly surged up, one after another, hitting, shaking, splashing, stretching, and shrinking. The surface of the water was like countless wild flowers blooming, swaying back and forth.</p>
<p>The small boats, connected to each other, left the embankment and advanced towards the center of the river. All the jungles and thatched huts were shrinking, and the footprints sloping on the soft mud beside the river appeared as many vague black spots.</p>
<p>The twilight gradually deepened, swallowing the only remaining ray of light. Standing at the bow of the boat, it was impossible to distinguish between the sky and the water or to see clearly the distance. We could only infer the distance between the boat and the shore from the sound of the waves rubbing against the hull and determine the direction of progress from the whistling of the river wind.</p>
<p>The night wind on the river was getting stronger and stronger, sweeping across our boat in gusts, stirring up continuous waves and making our boat shake more violently. The bow and stern pitched and rolled, hitting the river water and making gurgling sounds.</p>
<p>"The night wind on the river is so strong. It can really be considered a great help!" two brothers suddenly laughed.</p>
<p>"Haha! The stronger the wind, the more energetic we become. The darker the sky, the more convenient we become. Wasn't the battle at Jilin River also fought in this kind of weather and at this time, annihilating six hundred Japanese devils? Today is the same weather and time, hahaha!..." The old strongman steering the boat at the stern also laughed and spoke.</p>
<p>"Old Strong! Just hearing you say that makes my hands itch again. I've been resting in the rear for three weeks, so I haven't heard the miserable cries of the enemy for three weeks. I can't wait to jump across the river..."</p>
<p>"Paddle, faster! Almost near the shore. Don't worry, a rich harvest is right in front of us!" Their conversation stopped, and in the silence, they worked hard to paddle forward, quickly approaching the north bank of the river.</p>
<p>The impact of the boat and the water gradually subsided. Although the night was deep, we could still see a long line of shoreline in the darkness. Joy, hope, happiness, and determination suddenly filled everyone's hearts. Tense emotions roused even greater courage. Dozens of boats, like fighting for a prize, approached the breach in the river bank.</p>
<p>"Wh——Hiss——" The captain blew a sharp whistle, and a team of brothers quickly climbed the river bank.</p>
<p>Advance! Attack! Sparks burst in the air, and flames burned in the grass. The sky, the hillside, and the fields were immediately scattered with many red stars. The devil's camp near the river bank also seemed to be mobilized. Bullets and shells flew like shooting stars, crisscrossing and covering the dark sky. A team of brothers who had crossed the river advanced bravely, spreading their legs and braving the enemy's artillery fire!</p>
<h3>The Hand of Memory</h3>
<p>— Liu You</p>
<p>I can't hear anything, I can't think of anything, and the present is a vast expanse. I can only sit quietly, close my eyes, and a smile emerges for no reason at the corner of my mouth.</p>
<p>At this moment, the hand of memory stretches out! It flies! It flies far and high.</p>
<p>Ah! It is flying, flying on the road I have come. It flies quickly, searching for my past deeds, and begins to seize them!</p>
<p>Yesterday's bitterness and past joy are seized by it!</p>
<p>Past sins and former glories are also seized by it!</p>
<p>Seized! Everything is seized!</p>
<p>But it flies forward, higher and farther, and catches my childhood!</p>
<p>——Living in the old house in my hometown, playing on the land of my hometown.</p>
<p>——An ignorant baby, crying in his mother's arms.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it flies back, and it presents to me what it has seized, without leaving anything behind.</p>
<p>I accept it gratefully! I love its gifts, and I praise its merits.</p>
<p>I was admiring its gifts when I suddenly found infinite sorrow.</p>
<p>I am like a lost traveler in the deep mountains, hesitating and wandering.</p>
<p>I can't find anything anymore, and I haven't gained anything.</p>
<p>I know that what it has given me is the "emptiness" it has seized!</p>
<h3>If Medicine is Ineffective, Why Not Pull it Out!</h3>
<p>— Shifang</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on "Curiosity"</h3>
<p>— Sophia</p>
<p>"Curiosity,"—just like someone who has never been to Shanghai is surprised by the prosperity of Shanghai and becomes intoxicated by it.—Although it may seem a bit "rustic" in the eyes of "gentlemen," it is, in terms of human desires, a manifestation of a "pursuing" heart.</p>
<p>For example, when the Lunar New Year arrives, there are people selling beauty paintings for the month on the side of the road. On a quiet empty wall, they hammer in a few nails, string up a rope, and then hang up portraits of famous people or Western paintings, such as photos of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman Lin Sen, and then nude beauties, as well as brightly colored and lively "scenery paintings" with airplanes and airships above, warships and battleships below, and cars in the middle. There are the Bund of Shanghai's main road, as well as something from America, something from France, and so on. Although the upper classes who have been there or are afraid of being embarrassed are naturally not happy to go to the crowd to see it clearly, there is another group of people who are very interested in discussing it, staring intently at the American bridge, like a child listening to fairy tales.</p>
<p>This is what people know, they haven't seen it, it's "curiosity."</p>
<p>Naturally, after "curiosity," comes the desire to see it in person, but their "good fortune" is limited to this. They don't have the "good fortune" to go to America, and even going to the cinema is considered extravagant. They have no choice but to "appease their hunger with a painting of a cake" on this cold street. At most, if they can't bear to part with it, they might generously buy it back to decorate their home for the New Year.</p>
<p>The actions of people who generously buy one to take home may be laughed at by the general public as "rustic," but the more determined they are to buy it back, the more fiercely they pursue new things. This pursuit is not shameful. This act of "curiosity" is proof of the person's heart, extremely hoping for a new future.</p>
<p>"Appeasing hunger with a painting of a cake" may be boring and useless, but at least it is yearning for this "cake" to be truly edible!</p>
<p>This kind of "curiosity" situation is probably most prevalent in China; and these kinds of paintings sell far better in the countryside than in the cities. Although the Chinese people claim to be conservative, because the countryside still has such a desire for all things new, the Chinese people are not conservative; conversely, if these new things are truly suitable for human needs, then the conservatives will not oppose them either. People ultimately know what is good and bad. If airplanes can bomb civilians, then it is better to "be conservative" and say, "Let's not have these things."</p>
<p>China has been made to lag behind the world's rate of progress due to natural disasters and man-made calamities. Watching new things being invented in other people's homes one by one, what they feel is only "curiosity." This manifestation of people's desire for progress is extremely tragic. I hope that in this national reform, they will no longer look at the "painting of a cake" on the wall and drool.</p>
<p>Let them also taste a real cake!</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>"This place is very close to Hepu Town, and the × army might come here to search in the dark of night. Everyone must pay extra attention, be vigilant at all times, keep your guns by your side, and never take off your clothes."</p>
<p>Although she exhorted them in this way, everyone had been working hard all day, and at this moment they had all fallen asleep soundly. Even the head of the military medical department was no exception, and some people even let out loud snores. Only Fang Hui dared not fall asleep. She opened her eyes, gazing into the darkness, and listening intently to the sounds outside.</p>
<p>In the middle of the night, there was suddenly a rapid burst of barking from outside, followed by barking from two or three other places. Fang Hui was just about to fall asleep when she heard this sound. Her drowsiness disappeared completely, and she quickly jumped up and pressed her ear to the mud floor to listen carefully. In addition to the barking of dogs, there was also the faint sound of leather boots, and it sounded like a dog had been kicked and was letting out a miserable whimper. She quietly opened a crack in the door and saw the light of a flashlight flickering outside. Several dark figures were wriggling behind the light, and suddenly the light shone directly at her, and her entire body was exposed without any cover in the light. Three ferocious × soldiers walked towards her. The one in front held a Mauser pistol, and the two behind him held Arisaka rifles level, in a aiming position.</p>
<p>This was a very critical and tense situation. Fang Hui had no weapons by her side, and there was no time to turn back and get them. If her body moved, the bullets could immediately hit her. She knew that the current situation did not allow her to evade. Relying on her usual outstanding courage, she simply stood motionless in front of them, watching what they would do.</p>
<p>The three × soldiers stopped about five yards away from Fang Hui. The one in front holding the Mauser pistol actually spoke Chinese, speaking fluent Shanghai dialect. He grinned lewdly and called out to Fang Hui:</p>
<p>"Hey! Miss."</p>
<p>"What do you want?" Fang Hui, fearing that she would reveal her secret, pretended to be terrified.</p>
<p>"Miss, I'll show you something good." As he spoke, the × soldier reached into his arms and took out a photo. Using the light of the flashlight, he waved it at Fang Hui and said proudly, "This is my wife, Chiyoko. Do you think she's beautiful? Pretty?"</p>
<p>Fang Hui actually hadn't seen it clearly, but she deliberately praised without reservation:</p>
<p>"She is indeed very beautiful and very pretty! Why don't you stay at home with such a beautiful and pretty wife, living a happy and blissful life? Instead, you abandoned her and ran all the way to our China?"</p>
<p>"There's no way!" The × soldier seemed to be moved by Fang Hui's words, and his expression was filled with emotion as he spoke.</p>
<p>Fang Hui deliberately asked again:</p>
<p>"Now that you've run here, what do you intend to do?"</p>
<p>The × soldier returned to his original lewd and shameless look, took a step closer, and said: (36)</p>

<h3>Talking About International Gambling</h3>
<p>— Fo</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia is gone! The German army has marched into the capital of Czechoslovakia in a mighty force. President Hácha, like a sheep, has presented a "surrender" to Hitler. This son nurtured by the democratic nations has died young, and I don't know what his feelings are. Some say that the Munich Agreement was barely dry, and Mr. Hitler's face has already changed. He is getting an inch and wanting a mile, and he is too unkind. In fact, this situation was entirely created by Mr. Chamberlain single-handedly. The demise of Czechoslovakia is not the last act, and the real good show is yet to come.</p>
<p>I don't understand national strategies or the international situation. I only know how to play mahjong. In playing mahjong, there is only good luck and bad luck. If you play the wrong tile, the hand will go down, or you挺 three, six, nine of Bamboo or one, four, seven of Wan but do not win, but are intercepted by a 挺 edge or embedded tile, this kind of bad luck is really touching India. Mr. Chamberlain should have "碰" the Sudetenland tile but did not, and Hitler was allowed to eat an embedded tile, and then won three times in a row. How comfortable! There must be East after three consecutive wins, and maybe he will win a hand of three-台辣子, who knows. It is really just one wrong move, and the whole game is defeated.</p>
<p>Westerners don't play much mahjong but are good at playing poker. The other day, the chairman of the US Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Wadman, said to the press, "Hitler is a 'national player' in playing poker with European countries. The cards in the hands of each country are better than those held by Germany, but they are still defeated by Germany." These words are indeed correct. On the other hand, the countries of the democratic front are too cumbersome in their poker skills. Assuming that Hitler cheats, you must look and see. Hitler will definitely fail. Now, Hitler's first cheating victory has given him a large capital and a strong courage. For the second cheating victory, others will not dare to look. The second cheating victory is followed by the third and fourth cheating victories, and others will be even more afraid to look. Thus, Hitler becomes an invincible "poker master."</p>
<p>Four people play cards, and two people suffer from the plague. Hitler and Mussolini are still carrying the sedan chair. I release a 中風 to you, and you release a 白板 to me. You want to win three 番, and I want to win 清一色, which makes the other two families stare blankly, unable to arrange. Although Mr. Chamberlain feels that he has played the wrong cards, the situation is getting worse and worse, and the capital is getting smaller and smaller. It is already impossible to save. Although condemning Hitler for disrupting the overall situation is in vain, many chips have already been taken away by Mr. Hitler. Germany and Italy call themselves the axis of Europe, one developing on land and the other thinking about water. One supports and one sings, causing all countries to be busy and unable to cope. Isn't this the same as carrying a sedan chair while playing cards? In the current situation, if the countries of the peaceful front do not wake up and are unwilling to unite thoroughly, it is the so-called "A Yuan wearing a hat, it must be over."</p>
<h3>Concerning Hebei Fourth Cun Middle School</h3>
<p>— Tingmei</p>
<p>On the 13th, various newspapers in this port published the news of the Fourth Cun Middle School in Hebei engaging in a desperate battle with the Japanese army in prominent positions. Because of this heroic deed, the unfamiliar name of Fourth Cun Middle School was deeply imprinted on people's minds. I once taught at Fourth Cun Middle School. To strengthen our resistance, I will write a bit about the history of Fourth Cun Middle School so that everyone knows that this heroic deed was not accidental. At the same time, it can also prove the great responsibility that education has to the country and society.</p>
<p>Fourth Cun Middle School was previously just a small rural elementary school in Boye, consisting of several adobe houses surrounded by a fence. Later, it was expanded with investment from the local gentleman Zhang Yinwu, and then it was renamed. From an elementary school to a middle school, by the time the July 7th Incident broke out, the school buildings were connected in a row, and there were nearly a thousand students!</p>
<p>The name Fourth Cun originates from the Yan-Li School of Qing Confucianism. In my childhood, my grandfather used to smoke his pipe, bask in the sun, and tell me the story of Yan Xizhai. He said: Yan Xizhai was a great Confucian of this county. His family was extremely poor. When he was three years old, his father was taken away by Tatar soldiers – referring to the Manchurian soldiers – and his mother remarried. He begged for leftover food and soup in the neighbor's house, and sometimes helped people weed in the fields. When he was in his twenties, he learned that his father had been taken away by Tatar soldiers, so he was determined to go beyond the border to find his father. But it happened to be a time of war and chaos, year after year, so it was not until he was in his fifties that he went beyond the border. After years of hardship and suffering, he finally carried his father's bones back and buried them in the ancestral graveyard.</p>
<p>In terms of academic studies, Yan Xizhai countered the empty and superficial practices of Song Confucianism and vigorously advocated practical learning. He said: "People's years and energy are limited. Spending a day reciting texts is like losing a day practicing; adding a point to paper and ink is like subtracting a point from one's own life." Therefore, he wrote very few books. The ones that people often talk about today are only the four essays: "Cun Xue" (Preserving Learning), "Cun Zhi" (Preserving Governance), "Cun Ren" (Preserving Humanity), and "Cun Xing" (Preserving Nature).</p>
<p>The name Fourth Cun Middle School is obviously based on this. Since it respects Yan's learning, the school's spirit is simple, steadfast, and diligent in practice, which outsiders cannot possibly imagine even a fraction of. Zhang Yinwu deeply felt that modern youth are frivolous, conceited, and ashamed to return to the countryside, so he advocated Fourth Cun to rectify these shortcomings. All the teachers and principals in the school engaged in education with a spirit of sacrifice; their lofty aspirations and pure conduct made them role models for young people. The students not only had military training courses; their daily lives were all disciplined and militarized. The uniform was made of coarse cloth, brown in summer and black in winter, with leggings and belts. They always considered themselves the pillars of the nation.</p>
<p>Although I left Fourth Cun nine years ago, the situation at that time is still like yesterday. The sound of the bugle marked the beginning of the day's work, and the sound of the bugle sent the whole school to dreamland when the night was quiet. Our lives were constantly under tension. Burying ourselves in research in the library turned us into bookworms; watering and fertilizing in the fields was no different from farmers; and when we went to the fields, we rode horses and tried our swords, looking like warriors who would capture generals and seize flags.</p>
<p>At this critical moment of the War of Resistance, the teachers and students of the school put what they had learned into practice based on their consistent spirit of physical exertion, and dedicated it to the country with sincere enthusiasm. I still remember the most popular song in the school, which had these words: "...Good men's heads are upright, good men's lives are light, good men die on the battlefield to receive fame..." Now the teachers and students of the school have died on the battlefield, though not for any fame before or after death!</p>

<p>(Young Man) C... can I say it? (Man) It doesn't matter, take your time! (Young Man) Then I ask for your forgiveness, Your Honor! (Sings) Before I speak, tears flow uncontrollably; Matters of the heart, I will tell Your Honor in detail. He Chengxin is a false name, pure fiction; I am originally from Jianzhou, Fan Shizhou of the Fan family. I only hate that Fan Ruwei, the bandit chief, is the source of trouble; He kills officials and soldiers, deceives good people, and occupies Jianzhou. I advised him to surrender to the Song Dynasty, but he ignored it; I advised the soldiers with righteousness to cooperate on the same boat. When the Han army came, I escaped with my confidants; In Yue's camp, I made meritorious service, ascending the city tower at night. Breaking Luzhou, I was the first to contribute, the marshal was very kind; Protecting the young general, I was promoted to envoy, rewarding my efforts. This matter has not been revealed for eight years; Your Honor asks, I can only tell the details. (Man) So it seems, you are a national hero, I have been disrespectful: (Young Man) I am ashamed, ashamed! (Man) Did your wife get married before or after being with the bandits? (Woman secretly enters and eavesdrops) (Young Man) Your Honor! (Sings) Among the bandits, I happened to meet a daughter of an official family; Because of shared aspirations and common interests, we became husband and wife. When the Han army arrived, we agreed that the husband would not remarry; The wife would not remarry, always remembering each other, our fates forever intertwined. Now, it has been eight years, with no news for a long time; I think my wife has passed away, how lonely I am! (Woman secretly wipes tears) (Man) When the envoy met your first wife, what was the token?

<h3>Impressions of "Boys Town"</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>In Omaha, Nebraska, USA, there is a unique small city, the quietest and most meaningful corner of the world, where a very bright and clean little government is successfully run by children. It has 275 citizens, the oldest being 18 and the youngest only six. Two hundred are boys, and seventy-five are girls. - That little city is Boys Town, an orphanage that Father Flanagan has painstakingly managed for twenty-one years. (See Asian Film News)</p>
<p>"Boys Town" describes the history of Father Flanagan's fight for those orphaned and helpless children. Spencer Tracy, who won the Academy Award last year, plays Father Flanagan, and Mickey Rooney, who co-starred with Spencer Tracy in "Captains Courageous," plays Whitey, who is "in league with bandits, fierce and stubborn." Due to the collaboration of these two excellent actors and the superb artistic skills of director Norman Taurog, the content and form of "Boys Town" have reached the pinnacle of art.</p>
<p>Now, I will briefly describe the various aspects as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Actors: Spencer Tracy as Father Flanagan - From listening to the confession of a condemned prisoner in jail, he was determined to take on the responsibility of educating children. He solicited donations from all parties, took in children, built houses, influenced Whitey, was criticized by society, and finally the truth came out, and his career was successful. Spencer Tracy was able to reveal a spirit of hardship and perseverance from his calm facial expressions. The scenes of influencing Whitey and Pee Wee were particularly profound and moving. Mickey Rooney as Whitey - He not only portrayed a stubborn and indifferent bad boy to the fullest extent (e.g., when he first met Father Flanagan, he deliberately held a cigarette in his mouth and crossed his legs, vividly showing the appearance of a hooligan child; when he led the tour of the various workshops after entering the orphanage, he was also impetuous and indifferent), but also when Pee Wee was run over by a car, his pure conscience was discovered. After listening to the prayers of all the children in the orphanage, he wandered aimlessly in the streets, and finally, when he was elected mayor of the orphanage, the emotion of wanting to cry but having no tears, and finally throwing himself into the Father's arms, can be said to be "touching the heart and spleen", sweeping away his past misdeeds from the audience's minds, and making them feel his innocence and loveliness instead. "There is no such thing as a bad boy in the world," his acting more powerfully proved Father Flanagan's belief. Bobs Watson, who played Pee Wee, is also a rare child star.</p>
<p>(2) Director: Norman Taurog's skillful technique also proves that "integrating education with entertainment" is not just a slogan. Although "Boys Town" is also a historical film, it does not indulge in unnecessary horizontal development. It tightly grasps the main thread, eliminates the dross, and develops consistently, and it is lively and natural. For example, the insertion of David and the loan scene is too cute. A steel watch and a toy are used as collateral for one hundred dollars. However, after the Father says that every child will become a good citizen in the future, the problem is solved. The director further demonstrated his courage in grasping the emotions and atmosphere of the entire film. For example, at the beginning, the scene where Father Flanagan meets the condemned prisoner, the close-ups of several prisoners and Father Flanagan are very powerful. Even more lovable is Whitey's determination to escape, Pee Wee's insistence on going with him, all the way to the scene where the bandits rob the bank. From the light mood to the abyss of sorrow, and then jumping up to unfold the tense scene, the director tightly pulls the audience's heart, almost making people breathless. The conciseness of other screenwriting is, of course, secondary.</p>
<p>After watching "Boys Town," I was really moved. "There is no such thing as a bad boy in the world," but in every corner of the world, the pure conscience of children is being eroded, causing them to fall into irredeemable environments. Therefore, it is felt that work like "Boys Town" is very urgent. Now, people in Shanghai who care about children's welfare are paying attention to this work, and that is the "Shanghai Children's Welfare Association." A feature article was published in this magazine last week. After more than a year of efforts, they have established a very solid foundation. It is hoped that the staff of the association will work harder, and it is hoped that all sectors of society can provide material and spiritual assistance so that it can be expanded to all of China and the world, "so that every child can become a good citizen in the future."</p>

<p>He Liyu said: "Really! When we got off the train, at the station, we saw someone who looked like a police officer. He even raised his hand to salute you. After that, we went from the station to Shih Lake, and then from Shih Lake we sent Sister Junsu to Soochow University, and then we set off from Soochow University. We didn't see a single policeman along the way." Zhu Airen said: "The policeman we saw at the station just now was named Fang. He is specially assigned to the station. Every time a train arrives, he has to remember any special guests or foreigners who come to Suzhou for sightseeing, and some even have to report to his superiors. Speaking of that policeman named Fang, there is also a special anecdote, and it would be even more interesting to tell you." He Shuangyu said: "What exactly is the anecdote? Why is it even more interesting to tell us?" Zhu Airen laughed: "Let me tell you slowly! I am driving, don't rush me! It turns out that the policeman Fang is also a local. The place where he lives is only two or three li away from our hospital. His wife was pregnant and had registered at our hospital in advance and had her body checked. She was preparing to stay in the hospital when she was about to give birth. But when the time for delivery had passed, she still didn't give birth, and her belly was particularly large. It was even difficult for her to walk, so we took her to the hospital in a car. Everyone studied her case, and my adoptive mother, the old doctor Zhang, said that it must be twins. Because her belly was too big, and it was her first birth, we had to be very careful. The old doctor Zhang ordered me to personally deliver the baby. At this time, the policeman Fang heard that she was going to have a difficult labor, and he was extremely anxious, because they were a very loving couple. It wasn't until ten months and a week that she finally gave birth, and it was indeed a difficult labor. Fortunately, we had all prepared in advance, so there were no mistakes. When she gave birth, just as the old doctor Zhang had expected, she gave birth to one, and then another. We thought it was twins, but who knew there was still one inside after giving birth to two. She gave birth to three in a row. And all three of them were boys. For a time, the two midwives and the nurse were in a flurry. Because we had only prepared for twins, we hadn't prepared for triplets. Fortunately, there were many people in our hospital, and even the old doctor Zhang came to help. At that time, not only the whole hospital was in an uproar, but the whole town was also in an uproar. The old doctor Zhang said: 'We often have twins in our hospital, which is not surprising. But triplets are rare, so we have to take good care of them. We have to take care of the mother and the babies with all our heart.'" (63)</p>

<p>The Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Remembering Xia Yueshan's Patriotic Thoughts</h3>
<p>— Sun Xueni</p>
<p>I have a strong passion for drama, and I especially enjoy traveling to famous mountains. Whether in Wu, Yue, Lu, Yan, Wan, E, Min, Yue, or Japan and Southeast Asia, I always take the local drama as the guiding principle for entering the country and asking about customs. Although I don't fully understand it, it is enough to comprehend it with my heart. Drama can represent the cultural spirit of a place and is full of artistic interest. Its power to transform customs is no less than that of religious propaganda. Twenty years ago, when I was in charge of Chunliu, I first met Xue Shouling. Shouling was the literary son of Lord Yaoqing. At that time, the New Stage had moved to the Nine-Mu Plot. After a long time of acquaintance, I met Xia Yueshan. Observing his demeanor, he did not resemble someone from the performing arts world. Listening to his words, he was indeed worthy of respect. Therefore, I recalled and recorded it. (1) He had national thoughts. Xia was rich in patriotic thoughts. The New Stage moved from the Sixteenth Bund to the Nine-Mu Plot, entirely to revitalize the Chinese business district. The Nine-Mu Plot originally had a small population. Since the Kaiming Company built the stage, shops, and Kaiming Lane, the number of residents increased daily, and the city appearance changed dramatically. At that time, it was still considered insufficient, and there was a plan for the East Asia Grand Theater, with a budget of 1.2 million yuan. An engineer was hired to design it. The surrounding gardens and rockeries were beautiful, and the structure of the stage was unique. The area was huge, enough to accommodate the background. The seats were wide and comfortable, and the sight lines and lighting were rationalized everywhere. Because the surrounding gardens could isolate sound waves from the outside world, the conception was undoubtedly novel. Unfortunately, Xia died early and did not achieve his ambition. Even with the play "New Camellia," it was full of national defense meaning. His hard work in promoting drama aroused the audience's patriotic interest, which is certainly not to be criticized.</p>
<p>(2) He had social significance. Looking at Xia's life as a whole, such as the Performing Arts Association, which raised the personality of actors, the Fire Brigade, which was related to public welfare, the Zhenling School and the Qing'e Sports Association, which were aimed at education, all were beneficial to society, not just artistic abilities. The play "Black Register of Wrongs" once caused a sensation, and his earnestness was admirable. There were often people who were jealous of him. When the play was being performed, two bombs were thrown, but he did not stop the performance. His indomitable spirit was truly rare.</p>
<p>(3) He had a revolutionary stance. "Regrets of the Late Ming Dynasty" and "Emperor Huizong and Emperor Qinzong" were all plays written and directed by Xia, depicting the tragic pain of national subjugation, which had the same subtle effect as the tragic national subjugation of Poland. During the Sixteen Bund era of the New Stage, there were often revolutionary martyrs in the manager's office. At the end of the Manchu Qing Dynasty, he once wrote to the Prince Regent, recounting that actors should be treated equally and should not be classified as prostitutes. His reasoning was righteous, and his loud cry was truly commendable.</p>
<p>(4) He had moral concepts. Xia himself was frugal, but he treated others generously. Although the "Living Buddha Jigong" was a myth, it was nothing more than an exhortation to goodness and a sharp criticism of the world. He had the skill of depicting the spirit of the subject. Unfortunately, no one succeeded him, and it became a swan song. The entire play "Heavenly Retribution" was admired by Lao Tan, and the mediocrity of the rest need not be mentioned. The test of "Heavenly Retribution" also contained the meaning of encouraging good and punishing evil, the so-called "Sheng Gong's preaching, stubborn stones nod," and other old plays, such as "Yin Yang River," "Meilong Town," "Yellow Crane Tower," "Dumu Pass," etc., also had unique features. As for the improved new drama, it was a transitional era and often had the danger of being incompatible. One cannot be blamed for being neither donkey nor horse, nor for forgetting one's ancestors. In short, Xia not only contributed to drama but also to society, and his influence on the country was profound. It is only a pity that his son, Xiaoshan, engaged in electricity, studied in Europe, and after returning to China, he could not continue his father's business, promote his great ideas, and complete his unfinished ambitions!</p>
<h3>Playwright Lu Xiaoting Reports: Inland Theater Industry Union Established in Guilin</h3>
<p>— Haisheng</p>
<p>Playwright Lu Xiaoting wrote a "Lin Chong" at the Tianchan Stage last year. His writing style could not cater to the tastes of the audience in the isolated island. With the scars of failure, he left Shanghai for Guilin, and later went to Liuzhou. When the Weixin Theater Troupe, funded by the Liuzhou County Party Department, was established, he joined the service, and he found a more meaningful outlet.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I received a letter from him from Guiyang, reporting an important news in the theater industry, that is, the Guilin Opera and Ping Opera groups in Guilin have organized and established an "Inland Theater Industry Union," with no less than 500 comrades joining. It is guided by Mr. Ma Yanxiang of the Political Department of the Guilin Camp, and Feng Yukun is the chairman. He is also one of the cadres. Recently, he wrote a "New Yue Fei," which has been submitted to the Political Department for review.</p>
<p>At the end of the letter, he said a few extremely excited words: Tian Han has sent a telegram to encourage us, not to disappoint us for our hard work in the mainland. You wait for our good news. In the near future, we will change to a new battle line.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Actresses</h3>
<p>— Henei Maiden</p>
<p>The leading actress Zhang Eyun, since coming to Shanghai, has had an excellent reputation. When she has no shows at home, she does not wear makeup and often wears a long black robe with a monk's collar, which is very elegant.</p>
<p>The rising star Wang Xichun gets up early to practice her voice very diligently. Every day when she goes to Carter Road, she must enter and exit a flower shop because her residence is also on the upper floor of the International Photo Studio.</p>
<p>The pillar of the Xinxin Grand Jing Troupe, Dong Mingyan, is skilled in both civil and military arts and is famous far and wide. Recently, she has been studying at the Chinese Vocational School on Avenue Edward every morning, resembling a female student.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang's disciple Mao Jianqiu will soon take a large number of stage photos to give to relatives and friends. When she meets familiar girlfriends backstage, she becomes very physical and seems to be making a ruckus.</p>
<p>One of the four famous female lead actresses in the South, Zhang Wenqin, has recently retired and is temporarily not joining any troupe. Besides writing a page of small regular script every day, her hands are constantly knitting wool sweaters.</p>
<p>The progressive actress Jin Suwen often goes to Avenue Joffre alone early in the morning to breathe fresh air. After returning, she reads a novel before eating and going to the courtyard.</p>
<p>The golden-voiced Yun Yanxia has exquisite artistic skills. She has been working hard day and night during the New Year, and her body is very weak. As soon as she finishes a show, she goes home to rest.</p>

<p>A Snapshot of the Dance World</p>
<p>— Xiaotian</p>
<h3>Dragon Heads and Trailers</h3>
<p>Newcomers to the dance hall, upon hearing the terms "dragon head" and "trailer," cannot help but be astonished. Since it's neither a railway nor a station, where do these dragon heads and trailers come from? It turns out that "dragon head" refers to a dancing girl, but not every dancing girl is called that. "Dragon head" and "trailer" are relative terms. Once a "trailer" is attached, she's called a "dragon head." Without a "trailer," wouldn't she just be a bare dragon head? Then she wouldn't be called a "dragon head."</p>
<p>So, what exactly is a "trailer"? Those in the know say that when a dancing girl and a dance partner hit it off, from the dance partner's perspective, it's called "catching a dragon head." This dance partner then becomes the "trailer." A dance partner with the qualification of being a "trailer" is in for big trouble because the dancing girl doesn't have a lifetime contract with any particular dance hall. Moreover, tea dances, night dances, and lunch dances are mostly not held at the same venue. Therefore, any dance partner who hits it off with a dancing girl seems to be legally obligated to support her wherever she goes. If the dancing girl is working at the East family's place today, the dance partner has to follow her to the East family's place to show support. If she's working at the West family's place tomorrow, he has to follow her there. In this way, the dancing girl is like the locomotive on a train, and the dance partner naturally becomes a trailer attached to the locomotive.</p>
<p>There's also a very subtle explanation. The more powerful the locomotive of a train, the more trailers it can pull. The more magical the "dragon head" dancing girl, the more trailers she can attach. If a "dragon head" can attach dozens of "trailers," dance tickets will flow in endlessly. Her status will then be like that of a celebrated actor in the dance hall world. Big and small dance halls will compete to hire her, and staff and servants will attend to her every need. See how impressive that is?</p>
<p>Furthermore, one "dragon head" can simultaneously pull dozens of "trailers," but one "trailer" cannot simultaneously connect to dozens of "dragon heads." This is also quite similar to the actual situation with trains. You might say that being a "trailer" is a raw deal, but if you think about it carefully, the "dragon head" was also born to parents and has a clean reputation. Isn't that also a raw deal?</p>
<p>Speaking of "trailers," there are also many different categories. However, these categories are somewhat far-fetched. Generally speaking, young masters and sons of wealthy families, impeccably dressed in Western suits, with brand new cars, have a group of hangers-on who constantly flatter them. As for cash and dance tickets, they can get whatever they want without asking. It goes without saying. Getting attached to this kind of "trailer" is both prestigious and profitable, so it's called a "blue steel car." This is considered an honor among their peers. Then there are wealthy merchants and tycoons, who, although advanced in age, are still quite generous and not too difficult to deal with. They also handle errands like driving and buying clothes well. This is a first- or second-class car. If it's a young clerk from a trading company, buying tickets for only three or five yuan, they pay on the spot. But if it's a country bumpkin who tries to get out of paying and insists on clinging to her every day, it's like chicken ribs – tasteless to eat but a pity to throw away. Then, depending on how much money they spend, they are classified as third- or fourth-class cars. There's also a type of university student who is young and wears a sharp suit, which seem to be two advantages, but they have little money and a bad temper, which seem to be two disadvantages. If they start talking about true love, it's truly unbearable. This type of customer can only be used occasionally and can't be relied upon for a living. They're called rickshaws. There's also a kind of tough guy who has money and power and dares to bring another acquaintance to the "dragon head's" location. The "dragon head" doesn't even dare to swallow her anger and has to deal with him and make small talk. This is called an armored car. Then there's a type of person who doesn't spend too much money, doesn't have a big presence, and whose attitude and behavior can be considered pretty good, and whose temperament and temper can be considered gentle. They're neither cold nor hot, like a bowl of lukewarm water, so they're called a horse-drawn carriage, probably because they're neither fast nor slow. The worst kind is called a manure truck because if you're attached to this kind of car, you have to keep it absolutely secret. If you publicize it, you'll be notorious, and no more customers will come to patronize you. If you go home with them, they can't support you. It's truly like a mute eating Coptis chinensis, an unspeakable suffering. However, there aren't absolutely no manure trucks in the dance hall world. Presumably, there are other benefits. I'm just repeating what I've heard and writing nonsense for a while.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and the Pear Garden in the Old Capital (123)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Zhuge Liang Brought to Trial Li Qi When He Executed Ma Su</p>
<p>The play "The Trial of Li Qi" was formerly Huang Runfu's signature piece. Later, Hao Shouchen also became famous for this play. Whenever people in Shanghai mentioned Hao Shouchen, they would always call him Li Qi Changting, meaning the first part is the trial of Li Qi's crimes, and the second part, Changting, focuses on Wang Liang's plea for mercy. This play also has another name, "Using Shackles." The actor performing this play must first imitate the actions and speech of a notorious bandit before he can talk about the singing, acting, reciting, and speaking parts. Shouchen claimed to be a successor of Huang San, so his performance also had many merits. After he returned to Beijing upon completing his term [in Shanghai], the people of Shanghai praised his performance, and some even said that in the net role, other than Hao Shouchen, there was no one else, north or south, who could sing this play. These words happened to reach Jin Shaoshan's ears. He immediately became angry and ordered a costume shop to make a criminal's outfit for him (a red jacket and pants, or sometimes a red silk single layer outfit). He ordered a set of shackles, and once everything was ready, he practiced the play and chose a good date to officially perform it at the Great Stage. Because he wanted to compete with Shouchen for a day's glory, he put in an extraordinary effort during the performance, and many people actually came to support him. Some said he was indeed better than Shouchen, while others said he was not as skilled as Shouchen. I have seen both of them perform this play, and they each had their own strengths, without clear superiority. However, other than these two, I haven't seen any other net roles currently performing it. The above discussion is about the play "The Trial of Li Qi," which is completely different from the "Trial of Li Qi" described below. In the past, there was a painted face actor in Beijing opera troupes named Li Shoushan. He was extremely tall, so his colleagues gave him a nickname, "Big Li Qi." Later, because the four characters were difficult to call, it was simplified to Big Li Qi. People who didn't know the details thought he was a brother of Big Li Wu (Li Shunting), but that was completely wrong. He was originally related to Li Xinfu (Li Ku), which had nothing to do with Big Li Wu. Xinfu performed strictly according to the rules and was very talented. Although he never became a major star, he often followed Old Tan and others as a supporting actor. However, connoisseurs greatly appreciated him. As for his precious brother, Big Li Qi, he was completely different from him. He wanted to sing every role – male, female, net, and clown. I once saw him paired with Lanfang in "The Odd Couple," playing Li Qi (male), and paired with Shang Xiaoyun in "The Kite Misunderstanding," playing the ugly maid (彩旦). He played Cao Cao in "Battle of Wancheng" (淨) with Xiaolou. The most laughable thing was that Li Qi also often liked to perform "The Trial of Li Qi," and he was indeed praised by the audience. His ugly maid in "The Kite Misunderstanding" was also called one of his masterpieces. There is a Jia Duocai today who, when paired with Xiaoyun as the ugly maid, imitates Li Qi's style and receives enthusiastic applause from the audience. So, although Li Qi was a net role, he was famous for the彩旦 role after his death. This can be considered a rare thing.</p>

<h3>Finance: Large Investors Sell Off, Cash Slump Intensifies, Lowest Plunges to 2076 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market situation for spot silver saw a gradually expanding range of fluctuations, with a daily difference of fifteen yuan. The situation initially experienced a sharp drop, followed by a rebound. This was initially due to the Qian-Dui banks leaning towards helping customers offload their holdings, coupled with the potential weakness of the US dollar. Additionally, bullion dealers shifted from selling to buying, leading to a reactive rise. Ultimately, the price fell by twelve yuan. Trading volume was similar to the previous day, at one thousand taels. Jewelry gold also dropped by two yuan, and Customs Gold remained unchanged. However, Sino-British pure gold continued to rise.</p>
<h3>Spot Silver Plunges by Twelve Yuan</h3>
<p>From the morning, a certain gold dealer immediately announced a selling price of 2092-3 yuan per bar (ten taels). However, buyers only offered 90 yuan, and it was not until 9:45 that the gold dealer sold 50 taels to the Qian-Dui banks at 2091 yuan, which was five yuan lower than the previous day's low. After the opening, most people adopted a wait-and-see attitude, with only a few buyers bidding prices aggressively, breaking into the 90 yuan range. A certain gold dealer then sold 50 taels to a jewelry shop gang at 86 yuan. Following this, the same jewelry shop gang sold 50 taels to a Qian-Dui bank at the same price. Later, the jewelry shop gang sold another 50 taels to a certain silver firm for 87 yuan. The jewelry shop gang then sold another 50 taels to a Qian-Dui bank for 86 yuan. A certain Qian-Dui bank, on behalf of its customers, sold 50 taels each to security firms and fellow Qian-Dui banks at 87 yuan each. After this, the jewelry shop gang stopped buying and began selling heavily, further weakening the underlying trend. Qian-Dui banks transacted 50 taels between themselves at 83 yuan. The jewelry shop gang sold 50 taels to a Qian-Dui bank at 82 yuan. Qian-Dui banks transacted 50 taels between themselves at 80 yuan. The jewelry shop gang sold 50 taels to a Qian-Dui bank at 77 yuan. Qian-Dui banks transacted 50 taels between themselves, with the lowest price reaching 76 yuan. After this, a wave of buyers suddenly took advantage of the low prices and aggressively bought, while sellers stopped selling and watched from the sidelines, leading to a rebound and a strengthening trend. The Qian-Dui bank bought 50 taels from a gold dealer at 81 yuan as the midday closing price. In the afternoon, the Qian-Dui bank first sold 50 taels to a gold dealer at 78 yuan. After this, due to news of a slight weakness in the US dollar, the price rebounded again. Qian-Dui banks transacted 50 taels between themselves at 80 yuan. A gold dealer bought 50 taels from a Qian-Dui bank at 81 yuan, and then bought another 50 taels from the Qian-Dui bank at 86 yuan. Finally, a securities firm bought 50 taels from a spot silver dealer at 2084 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price fell by twelve yuan compared to the previous closing price, with a daily difference of fifteen yuan. The spot silver dealer's own-brand gold was sold at 2095 yuan and bought back at 2080 yuan. The current margin gold, trading roughly fifty yuan below the listed price, saw no trading.</p>
<h3>Jewelry Gold Drops Twice</h3>
<p>The selling price of jewelry gold per tael initially remained unchanged. However, at 11 o'clock, due to the weakening of spot silver, the price was slightly reduced by one yuan. More than ten minutes later, hearing that spot silver was weakening further, the price was reduced by another yuan. The Dahang Tonghang (Big Bank Tonghang) revised their listed price to 211 yuan, and the Xinhang Tonghang (New Bank Tonghang) revised their price to 209 yuan, with a buying price of 203 yuan.</p>
<h3>Pure Gold Rises Again by Half a Penny</h3>
<p>A London telegram dated the 16th stated that, due to the continued weakness of the British pound, British pure gold rose again by half a penny per ounce, reaching seven pounds, eight shillings, and six pence. This caused the central bank's Chinese cash buying price to also rise to 1212 yuan and 3 jiao. The listed price of Customs Gold remained unchanged at 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 6 li. The Shanghai standard gold price also rose by 4 jiao, reaching 1207 yuan and 6 jiao.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold continued to rise by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate continued to decline by 0.0025. In the local foreign exchange market, foreign firms were eagerly closing positions, and banks were providing sufficient supply, so the prices remained stable. Only the US dollar showed slight weakness due to the continuous decline in the British-American cross rate. Spot silver investors were uncertain. The market opened weak, but small investors maintained their buying. Wealthy and Tianjin investors remained inactive and provided no support, leading to long-awaited position closings and a weakening market. Later, bullion dealers and Qian-Dui banks took advantage of the low prices to buy, slightly reversing the downward trend. Afternoon buying remained scarce, and trading volume decreased, resulting in a weak trend. Due to the weakness of spot silver, British and American gold pounds saw wealthy investors gradually emerge and sell, leading to a slight price decrease. British and American gold notes, and Hong Kong notes, were slightly more in demand, leading to a slight price increase. Recently, the trend of buying and selling has gradually decreased, and the market is extremely stable. Transactions at the Exchange Association were rare. Only Huitong sold 200 US gold notes to Yongtai. Yesterday's market prices: British gold pounds fell by 5 fen, British gold notes rose by 9 fen, American gold pounds fell by 1 jiao, American gold notes rose by 0.0013 yuan, Hong Kong notes rose by 0.0003 yuan, French franc notes fell by 5 hao, Dutch notes rose by 0.01 yuan, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Instability in Central European Situation, British-American Exchange Rates Fall for Three Consecutive Days</h3>
<p>Local Exchange Market Sees British Flatness and American Tightness</p>
<p>Due to the instability in the Central European situation and Germany's annexation of Czechoslovakia, the British-American exchange rate suddenly fell sharply. Yesterday, it fell another 0.00025 (investigation shows that it has fallen for three consecutive days, totaling 0.0008, to 8.125), leading to a situation of British flatness and American tightness. During the middle of the day, although foreign firms were slightly settling accounts, the market remained relatively flat due to the banks' willingness to supply. However, the American exchange rate saw weak selling interest from the banks due to operators expecting the British-American exchange rate to continue to weaken. In addition, a sudden surge in Hong Kong telegrams, despite some Tianjin speculators selling positions, ultimately saw more buying than selling, leading to a gradual weakening trend. The Hong Kong exchange rate, on the other hand, tended to ease due to frequent selling by foreign banks and Chinese banks.</p>
<p>In the morning, the London large order exchange rate remained flat, New York silver prices remained stagnant, London raw gold continued to rise by half a penny, the British-American exchange rate shrank by 0.00025, the British-French rate fell by 0.0003, the British-Shanghai rate remained unchanged, the American-British rate fell by 0.00025, the American-French rate fell by 0.00025, and the American-Shanghai rate shrank by 0.0005. The central bank's listed prices for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened in the morning with a selling price of 8.000825 pounds for the British exchange rate and 16.09375 yuan for the American exchange rate, with the British flat and the American tight by 0.0003125 compared to the previous close. After the opening, although foreign firms came to settle accounts, they were not affected due to the banks' willingness to supply. The announcement of the white silver equalization tax showed no increase or decrease, remaining at 8.50%. Later, although Tianjin speculators tended to sell, the market remained unchanged as banks took advantage of the low prices to buy. The Tianjin investors sold 16.125 yuan of American exchange to a favorable Dutch bank. Near noon, foreign banks Huayi and Chinese banks sold 55.375 yuan of Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms, and the market slightly strengthened. The midday closing bank selling price was 8.000825 pounds for the British exchange rate and 16.09375 yuan for the American exchange rate, unchanged from the morning opening.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, foreign firms came to buy British exchange from HSBC and favorable banks at 8.000825 pounds. Subsequently, a sudden surge in Hong Kong telegrams led to a slight weakening of the American exchange rate. The Hong Kong telegrams closed 16.09375 to 16.0625 yuan of American exchange with favorable Dutch Huabi bank. Finally, foreign bank Anda and Chinese bank sold 55.25 to 55.375 yuan of Hong Kong exchange to foreign firms, and the underlying trend gradually stabilized. By the evening closing bank selling price, the British exchange rate was 8.000825 pounds, and the American exchange rate was 16.0625 yuan. As a result, compared to the previous close, the British was flat, and the American was tight by 0.0003125, while the Hong Kong exchange rate conversely rose by 0.000125.</p>
<h3>Rediscount Rate Reaches 50 Yuan</h3>

At noon, it returned to 50 yuan and remained unchanged throughout the afternoon, which was 0.5 yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Tianjin and Hong Kong Exchange Market Telegrams</h3>

<p>British Exchange Rate: 7.6875 pence</p>

<h3>Securities: Rumors of New Government Bond Issuance, Minimal Impact on Market</h3>
<p>Market Once Chaotic, Quickly Recovered, Far East British Business Stocks Plunged</p>
<p>Yesterday, the security black market saw a situation where rumors of the government planning to issue 120 million yuan in new government bonds caused unnecessary confusion in the market. Some even used this opportunity to suppress prices, hoping to buy at low prices. Therefore, the opening market was extremely chaotic. Type E opened at only 49.2 yuan, and Type C opened at 50.07 yuan, a difference of as much as half a yuan. Subsequently, the prices quickly rebounded. According to rumors, a portion of this bond issuance is intended as a 5 million pound reserve for the Bank of Communications, while the remainder is for the development of the Northwest. The rumors state that it is entirely for production purposes and still needs to be confirmed. However, it can be said with certainty that this type of bond is unrelated to the unified national debt circulating in the market and that the issuance of new government bonds indirectly adds a layer of protection to the old government bonds. However, there is too much speculation in the market, which easily causes fluctuations. After this round of elimination, most of the small speculative investors have cut their losses, while the large bullish investors have remained steadfast and unmoved. Those who were shorting previously are now going long, so there are signs that the future trend will change. Yuan Da first suppressed the market in the morning, causing prices to become chaotic. Tiansheng Hao and Number 35 took the opportunity to aggressively buy, causing Type E to immediately rebound by one yuan. Although Defu Tongkang and Number 15 sold, Chen Kang Mao Da Runli and others continued to buy, and the price gradually stabilized. In the morning, it was slightly higher at 0.068 yuan. In the afternoon, the situation stabilized, Da Feng Hao switched from short to long, and Xie Da Yongkang and Number 52 all bought in. Although Defu and Number 11 continued to sell, the market gradually strengthened, and the rebound of 0.4 to 0.5 yuan was already determined, and the trend will likely change. The resulting market price was only slightly lower by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Bond Type | Highest | Lowest | Closing | Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>Unified A | 57.51 | 57.20 | 57.55 | Down 0.35</p>
<p>Unified B | 51.70 | 51.30 | 51.65 | Down 0.30</p>
<p>Unified C | 51.30 | 50.65 | 51.20 | Down 0.40</p>
<p>Unified D | 50.10 | 49.60 | 50.05 | Down 0.40</p>
<p>Unified E | 50.30 | 49.00 | 50.25 | Down 0.40</p>

Also, the aforementioned final dividend will be distributed starting after the shareholders' meeting on April 4.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Spot Yarn Market Becomes Hat Trading</h3>
<p>The reason for the market's inability to recover lies in this.</p>
<p>The yarn market has slightly recovered, but the increase is extremely slow. The reason is that customer sales remain slack and show no signs of improvement. Market transactions are still mostly occupied by transactions between the same industry, which is completely a kind of "grabbing the hat" mentality. If they can profit by one or two yuan, they will sell it off. Therefore, the market is unusually lively with people gathering, but upon investigation, the actual business is very little. If this situation continues, the inventory will inevitably become thicker and thicker. If the spot prices don't rise for a long time, there is a deep concern that it will ultimately be difficult to escape the need to stand firm and tend towards rising. In the afternoon, buyers from Yunnan and Shantou were slightly more active, and the market atmosphere tightened. The fundamental problem still lies in considering the actual sales. However, transactions still occupy more than 50% of the same industry.</p>
<p>The situation of spot yarn, the opening of the morning is still loose and weak, 20-count Double Horse sold for 392 yuan, with little difference from the previous day. However, there was a certain firm in the market searching for ten counts of yarn. The Hunan gang had a little business of 32-count fine yarn, and the atmosphere was slightly agitated, bringing it up one yuan. In the end, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 393.5 yuan, and the price of the warehouse receipt was 391.5 yuan. In the afternoon, the atmosphere was slightly higher, and the market was strong due to the slight needs of the southern region. No spot Double Horse was traded, and the price of the warehouse receipt was 392 yuan. As a result, the total amount of purchases from each gang throughout the day was 1,470 packages, and the average price rose by one to three yuan. However, the price increase of fine yarn was stronger. The factory opened up 120 packages of 10-count Flying Tiger from the Anda factory, with a price of 289.5 yuan. The Tianjin gang went there. Today, there are still 250 pieces of cotton yarn being transported to Fuzhou, another 280 pieces being transported to Shantou, and 25 pieces being transported to Hong Kong. The amounts bought by each gang are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Same Industry: 850; Xiamen: 20; Inland: 115</p>
<p>Hong Kong: 20; Shantou: 105; Hunan: 50</p>
<p>Wenzhou: 25; Sichuan: 35; Ningbo: 10</p>
<p>Tianjin: 120; Yunnan: 120</p>
<p>Total: 1,470</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market continues to rise, because the sales of 16-count yarn are smooth, and the northern buyers are very strong. Thus, it affects the 20-count yarn to also bring up the rise. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon is 338 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix is 330 to 329 yuan.</p>
<h3>Tongzhou Cotton Rises Again by One Yuan</h3>
<p>Peak Price Reaches Seventy-Nine Yuan, U.S. Cotton Price Drops, Transactions Slightly Active</p>
<p>The cotton business is still considered not weak, but less than the previous day. This is because the price continues to rise, and there is very little stock, making it difficult for factories to start, leading to a reduction in transactions. However, Tongzhou cotton has reached a new peak, with a price of seventy-nine yuan, an increase of one yuan from the previous day. Shanghai Fire Engine cotton also continues to rise by seven and a half jiao. With prices only rising and not falling, how can factories start? However, with no hope of supply, the market price is difficult to relax. Therefore, both Chinese and foreign factories are purchasing foreign cotton to compensate. Based on this situation, it is predicted that the purchase of foreign cotton is on the rise. Today, a Japanese factory imported 300 bales of Tianjin cotton, Yufeng purchased 1,000 bales of U.S. cotton, and Shenxin also imported 450 bales of U.S. cotton. Arrivals at the dock include 466 bales of Xiashe fine velvet cotton. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Tianjin Cotton 86.25 Imported by Dakang Factory 200 bales Cash to factory</p>
<p>Also 86.50 Also 100 bales Also</p>
<p>Chicken Feet Cotton 79.00 Imported by fellow traders 200 bales Wire transfer to warehouse</p>
<p>Shanghai Fire Engine 71.75 Also 200 bales Cash to warehouse factory</p>
<p>Argentina 90.00 Imported by Shenxin Factory 450 bales Cash to Factory No. 2</p>
<p>Xiashe Cotton 76.00 Imported by fellow traders 150 bales Wire transfer to warehouse</p>
<p>Squillamite 90.75 Imported by Yufeng Factory 1,000 bales Cash to warehouse</p>
<h3>Fifteen Sixteenths</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market price: New York cotton market is weak because of widespread rumors that the U.S. government's loan cotton will be released to encourage exports and provide cotton export subsidies to compete with the world cotton market. Therefore, the industry believes that it is necessary to release the loan cotton. Liverpool telegraphed a decline; spot merchants sold out and southern hedging was very strong, resulting in a sharp drop of ten pounds in recent and spot prices. India, including forecasts, fell two rupees; Egypt fell more than twenty pounds. Converted to legal currency, cotton prices have fallen: U.S. cotton and Brazilian cotton fell eight jiao per dan, Indian cotton fell seven jiao, and Egyptian cotton fell one yuan and one jiao.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading: due to the decline in New York prices, there were some transactions in U.S. cotton. Shenxin imported 500 bales of Argentine cotton at a delivered-to-factory price of 91 yuan. It also imported 108 bales of Indian cotton at a price of 76 yuan. Litai imported 500 bales of Brazilian cotton at a price of 74 yuan. On the Japanese factory side, the Shanghai factory imported 1,000 bales of Brazilian cotton, Toyota imported 500 bales of U.S. cotton, Gongda and domestic and foreign factories each imported 500 bales, and the remaining factories had no transactions. Yesterday's cotton prices are listed below:</p>

It was reported yesterday that the British company's Sumanli wheel will arrive in Shanghai tomorrow, carrying 3,106 bales of cotton from Mumbai. The ship will dock at Qichang Warehouse in Pudong for unloading.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Bleaching and Dyeing Factories' Output is Slow, Summer Goods Sales are Increasingly Popular</h3>
<p>Domestic cloth, spring and summer light-colored piece goods: the three largest new bleaching and dyeing factories in this city have not yet started operation, resulting in the dozen or so factories in operation having concerns about neglecting one thing while attending to another during this period when spring sales in this city and other cities are coming one after another. Grey cloth is congested, and the output of various mass-market finished products, such as poplin, bleached cloth, mercerized yarn, and light-colored cloth, is slow. It is difficult for customers to respond to the current demand, so the market atmosphere is particularly tense, and sales prices have been raised one after another, especially yarn-dyed poplin shirts and plain poplin. Zhejiang and Jiangxi merchants still account for the majority of sales. Guangdong merchants purchased more than 2,000 pieces of colored twill and more than 20 boxes of colored cloth poplin, and five or sixty packages of Fuguigui and other brands of fine cloth and fine twill. Wen and Yong merchants have a strong demand for white goods and fine cloth, with continued transactions of more than 100 packages of various brands, and about 50 packages of coarse cloth and fine and coarse twill. Sales prices are slightly fixed. Tianjin merchants purchased one hundred and several dozen boxes of goods such as poplin, blue cloth, and bleached cloth. The dye factory on this street purchased more than 100 packages of low-grade fine twill.</p>
<p>Due to the strong sales of colored cloth and colored twill in recent days, the dye factories on this street continue to need grey cloth, so the sales price of fine cloth and fine twill is gradually firm. The sales on this street are the largest outlet. Yesterday, orders reached another thousand pieces. Qingdao and Tianjin merchants only imported more than 300 packages of fine cloth. Dongmian Bank opened 3-400 pieces of 11-pound Blue Day fine cloth and Dragon Head Baby fine twill, the sales price of Blue Day fine cloth is 11.25 yuan per piece, Dragon Head fine twill is 11.7 yuan for next month, 11.65 yuan for this month, and Baby fine twill is 11.35 yuan.</p>
<p>Today, 1,400 pieces of piece goods were shipped to Tianjin, 120 pieces to Yantai, 380 pieces to Shantou, and 20 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Grains: It is Said That Changshu and Other Production Areas Have Stopped Issuing Transport Permits</h3>
<p>Shanghai's Du Geng Sales are Dull, Foreign Customers and Japanese Merchants are Inquiring</p>
<p>Du Geng: Yesterday, a total of eleven boats arrived from various sources in Heshui, and one to two thousand packages were transported by truck. The arrival of goods was suddenly scarce. It is said that a certain party has stopped issuing transport permits in Changshu and other places since the 15th of this month, so sellers' minds are firm and they hold on tightly. However, the sales market is dull, so most of the goods have not been sold. The market shows a situation of stability with softness. Hou Geng has fixed or small price changes of one or two jiao, Bo Dao has a price reduction of jiao, and Du Yangjiambu's supply and demand are similar and there is no change.</p>
<p>Ke Xian: Yesterday's Ke Xian digestion was still active. In addition to merchants and hoarders absorbing at low prices, retail customers also liked it very much, and Japanese merchants inquired about it, so the total market transaction opened to more than 4,000 packages, and the market price stabilized and was not affected by the Heshui Gengjian. Gao Mi is more stable. Nanjing Xian opened at 12.7-8 yuan, Wuhu Xian opened at 12.5-6 yuan, and the secondary grades varied.</p>
<p>Yang Mi: Fixed orders are not realized, and merchants and hoarders have always adhered to their position. Amidst the wild dumping of various rice prices in recent days, Yang Mi has not been affected. Yesterday, various households on this street handled 2-300 packages of Saigon No. 1, 198-jin original packages, which still opened at 17 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lack of Instant Powder, Factory Prices Hint at Higher Prices</h3>
<p>The flour market is gradually becoming firm. Sales to customers from the North and South are quite active. Due to the current shortage of instant powder and limited daily production, factories cannot fully supply it. They are insisting on the same price for local customers, and there are even hints of higher prices. Recently, the market price of foreign flour has also risen due to reports of rising prices abroad. Futures for March and April have been fully booked, and the price for May is 2.58 to 2.6 US dollars per barrel of four packages. Foreign firms have repeatedly made transactions, and the amount already ordered but not yet arrived is about 1 million packages. As for yesterday's local flour transactions, local customers totaled 3-40,000 packages. Supply and demand are still considered equal, and the market is brewing.</p>
<p>The wheat market is still stagnant. Recently, 2-300 packages arrive at the port in sporadic amounts every day, mostly directly sent to factories for pricing. Based on quality, they range from about 7 yuan to 6.7-8 yuan. Yesterday, it was reported that a flour factory in Hongkou Zhabei also purchased wheat directly from the production area because of a lack of wheat supply and no goods to receive.</p>
<p>Today, 2,500 packages of flour are exported to Tianjin, 7,000 packages to Fuzhou, 12,000 packages to Shantou, and 2,000 packages of bran are exported to Shantou.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Silk Initiates Second Price Increase</h3>
<p>If Shanghai Silk Can Handle Itself Well, Sales to the US May Be Possible</p>
<p>Yesterday's silk market saw another surge in Japan and the United States. New York spot Japanese silk rose by 7 cents each, Chinese silk rose by 5 cents each, and near and far futures rose by 4 to 5 cents. Yokohama spot prices rose by 35 yuan, and far futures rose by 40 yuan. In the afternoon, spot prices rose by another 5 yuan, but the far futures unanimously declined, such as a drop of 11 yuan in March, 18 yuan in April, 17 yuan in May, and 19 yuan in July. Lyon Shanghai Silk A rose by half a franc, and other Chinese and Japanese raw silk rose by one franc each.</p>
<p>The local silk market has no development in domestic or foreign sales. Foreign sales are still priced at 1,700 yuan. However, according to observation, if domestic silk prices do not rise blindly again, like the last time, then sales to the United States may be possible, because since the second price increase in foreign silk prices, the distance between Chinese and American silk prices has been greatly shortened. In terms of domestic sales, firstly, most silk factories have switched to using rayon, and they are indifferent to the rising wind of raw silk, which has made it impossible for hoarders to come out of their shells, and the number of transactions has decreased significantly. Yesterday, it was heard that the asking price for B-grade white silk has risen to 1,800 yuan. Although foreign firms have sent telegrams, they will have to see how the market goes today.</p>
<h3>Oilcake: Many Floaters Spit Out, Soybean Oil Falls Back, and Vegetable Oil and Bean Cake Also See Small Faces</h3>
<p>Soybean Oil: Yesterday's soybean oil market fell at the beginning of the morning, because general profit-taking floaters were eager to exit, spot oil fell 3-4 jiao, and futures oil fell 6-7 jiao. In the afternoon, Dalian all rose, and the market atmosphere tightened. According to statistics, 30 pieces of Lianqi Da were made, with a price of 29.8 yuan. 70 barrels of spot Dalian oil were priced at 32 yuan and 32.1 yuan. 200 barrels for delivery in 7 days were priced at 31.9 yuan. 100 barrels for next March were priced at 31.85 yuan. 500 barrels of Fengnian oil for April were priced at 31.5 to 7 jiao. According to the investigation, 400 packages of soybeans were exported to Fuzhou today, and another 1,000 packages were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Vegetable Oil: Yesterday's trading was sluggish. Only 20 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were traded, priced at 31 yuan, a small drop of half a yuan. This is because Yantai Ting-packed oil will arrive soon, causing the market atmosphere to ease slightly. In addition, there were 38 barrels of Dalian barrel vegetable oil, priced at 40 yuan. It is said that the oil was returned by merchants and hoarders to realize profits on contracts for the next March.</p>
<p>Bean Cake: Yesterday, the market was slightly frustrated because the Dalian market reported small losses. Futures cake fell by 5 fen, and 20,000 pieces of Lianguang cake were traded in May, priced at 3.15 yuan. However, spot cake continued to rise by 1 fen. 500 pieces of Dayou four-brand cake were sold by the Fuzhou merchants, priced at 3.47 yuan.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Jian Gu Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Fujian shiitake mushrooms have already arrived in Shanghai. Yesterday, they were immediately released, with thin mushrooms priced at 207.7 yuan, high thin mushrooms at 215.5 yuan to 222.8 yuan. Special Zhuangling mushrooms are in short supply, and ordinary mushrooms are priced at 233 yuan, and the situation is quite tight, rising more than 20 yuan compared to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Shantou Cotton White Transactions Still Strong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was stable. The association drew plates, and the spot price of 24 Dutch crude white was called 24.85 yuan, this warehouse's goods were 85 jiao, and transshipment was 16.55 yuan. Buyers are scarce. Taikoo Sugar B mark carmine has not changed. For domestic sugar, only Chao merchants opened more, and a batch of cotton white was traded, totaling more than 500 packages. The price of enough ice was 24.4 yuan, secondary grades were 3 jiao to 1 jiao, ice flower white was 23.5 yuan to 22.5 yuan, and the lowest was 21 yuan. As Jian merchants continue to increase arrivals of diaoqing, the original price is called, with no transactions. The future market should have a loosening hope. Two ships, Shandong Ganzhou, arrived in succession, carrying 600 packages of Taikoo car white, 100 pieces of boxed sugar, 2,143 packages of Qingchi sugar, 1,012 pieces of white sugar, and 71 pieces of Beihai red.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Tianjin Merchants Search for Black Iron Billets, Sales Prices Gradually Rise</h3>
<p>Black iron billets: due to year-end relations, holders were eager to sell, so the situation deteriorated. The previous market price had shrunk to 28 yuan (calculated per 200 pounds). However, since the new year, the standard has slightly improved, with each box selling for around 28.5 yuan. Recently, the market situation has become more bullish. It was found that yesterday's opening price has reached 29.5 yuan. In terms of actual sales, all are purchased by Tianjin merchants, so the spot goods on the market are unusually thin, and the market is difficult to loosen.</p>

<h3>How to Go to the Southwest</h3>
<p>— Bao</p>
<p>According to the current situation, if you want to go to the southwest from Shanghai, you can take the following routes:</p>
<p>(1) Take a boat from Shanghai to Ningbo, then take a small steamer to Xikou, then take a highway bus to Jinhua, and then take the fire army on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi, Guangdong-Han, Hunan-Guangxi three routes through Nanchang, Zhuzhou, Hengyang and other places to Guilin, and then transfer to various places in the southwest.</p>
<p>(2) Take a boat from Shanghai to Wenzhou first, then take a boat to Qingtian, and then take a car through Wenxi to Lishui, and take a highway bus from Lishui to Jinhua.</p>
<p>(3) Take a boat from Shanghai to French Haiphong, and then take the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway to Kunming. If you want to go to Guangxi, you can go to Hanoi first after arriving in Haiphong, and then enter the province of Gui via the highway through Zhennanguan.</p>
<p>(4) Take a boat to Hong Kong first, and then transfer to a boat to Haiphong, or take a Hong Kong-Hanoi flight to Hanoi.</p>
<h3>Haiphong to Kunming Yunnan-Vietnam Train Situation</h3>
<p>— Jing</p>
<p>From Haiphong to Kunming, there is the Sino-French joint venture Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, which runs directly between them, which is convenient for passengers. The engineering of this road is very great. There are more than 160 large mountain caves along the way, which shows the general situation. However, the track of this road is relatively narrow, and the number of passengers and cargo carried is also smaller due to this. From Defense to Yunnan, there are two types of vehicles: ordinary and express. Now I will briefly describe them separately. 1. Ordinary trains take a train from Haiphong to Hanoi every day. There are five fast and slow trains on this section every day, which only takes two hours to reach. The second train departs from Hanoi at 9:20 a.m., arrives in Lao Cai at 7:11 p.m. that day, departs from Lao Cai at 6:22 a.m. on the third morning, arrives in Kaiyuan at 6:07 p.m. that day, and departs from Kaiyuan at 6:36 a.m. on the fourth morning. You can arrive in Kunming at 4:47 p.m. that day. Passengers who take ordinary trains do not have sleeper facilities on the train. Passengers must find their own hotels in various places along the way. Fortunately, there are hotels established by the country in Hanoi, Lao Cai, Kaiyuan and other places, and there are no very inconvenient places.</p>
<p>2. Express trains only run twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. First, take a car from Haiphong to Hanoi. On the same day, take an express train from Hanoi to Yongmai at 8:30 p.m. This section of the train runs at night, and there are sleepers on the train, but only first and second class have sleeper facilities, and third class does not. The first class is divided into two types: A and B. Type A costs 6 Vietnamese dollars per person, and Type B costs 4.5 yuan per person. The second class costs 3 yuan per person. After arriving in Yongmai at 5:39 a.m. on the second day, you will have to transfer to the Michelin express train. The so-called Michelin train is similar to a public bus, with twelve rubber wheels running on the track. The speed is quite fast, but there are very few seats in the car. Those departing from Yongmai on Wednesdays only have 15 first-class seats. Those departing from Yongmai on Fridays only have 18 first-class seats and 19 third-class seats. Passengers should register in advance in Haiphong before departure, otherwise they will not be able to get a seat. The car departs from Yongmai at 6:19 a.m. and arrives in Kunming at 6:42 p.m. on the same day. Each person is only allowed to carry 15 kilograms of luggage on the Michelin train, and the free luggage allowance is still 30 kilograms, which can be delivered by ordinary train one or two days before departure.</p>
<p>The ticket price is difficult to calculate because the railway is divided into two sections, the domestic section and the Vietnamese section, and the currency system of each section is different. Now, according to the latest exchange rate, the ticket price is as follows in the combined Chinese currency:</p>
<p>First class: approximately 149.00 yuan in Chinese currency, second class: 104.63 yuan, and third class: approximately 54.6 yuan.</p>
<p>(The prices for through trains and express trains are the same)</p>
