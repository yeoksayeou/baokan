<p>社評</p>
<h3>美英法三國照會與日本</h3>
<p>十二月卅一日，美國對日本，提出有關遠東大局之照會；一月十四日。英國繼之；十七日，法國又繼之；氣求聲應，勢若聯珠。世界民治列强對於遠東之侵略者，將於外交上作平行舉動，盛傳已久，至是而始發其端。綜觀三國照會，措辭各殊，而其涵義則盡同；要點凡五；權益備受侵損，不能長此容忍，一也；日本歷來所提供之諾言，信用喪盡，二也；揭破所謂新秩序，僅爲關閉門戶之託辭，三也；武力變更之狀態，不能視爲有效，四也；九國公的等國際條的，不容片面廢棄而仍必予以尊重，五也。語氣堅决，辭意嚴重，爲國際文書所僅見；蓋視數年以來，各國假作痴聾，虛相委蛇，徒以冠冕而浮泛之外交辭令相應對者，信乎進一步矣。</p>
<p>日本對於三國照會，將如何答復，猶無從覘知。據彼言論界所透露，則謂日本政府將以三條件，爲對英美談判之基礎：一，東方各國之完全解放，包括消除中國殖民地地位，及東方人民旅行居住自由在內；二，全世界貿易之完全自由，包括取消現有之經濟集團，及廢除關稅壁壘，與輸入限額在內；三，原料之重行公允分配，包括自由購買國家生存所不可少之原料，及保全國防所必要之天然利源在內。謂必如是焉，一切紛爭自然消釋云。夫如是云云者，固爲日本當局之見解，以宣傳爲試探，乃談判之先聲乎？非也。何以言之？日本乃侵略之禍魁，决非弱小之護法，跡彼思想行動之途徑，邏輯上斷乎無此結論。且謂日本以侵略中國之不能成功而併將自動放棄其對於高麗台灣與太平洋代管諸島之控制；亦爲常情常理所不能置信。即以彼第一第二兩項所稱之自由與第三項所稱之支配，分析其意識所在，尤易發見其矛盾而反證其不誠。或日，窮則變，變則通；安知非日本之幡然改圖？或曰，放下屠刀，立地成佛；安知非日本之憬然省覺？是必大智大慧之政治家，始能有此大手筆；日本有智慧之文人，故有此說；日本無智慧之政家，故無此事。不然，自九一八發動武力侵略之後，處處可以證明其舉動之錯誤，即時時有勒馬懸崖之機會；即於七七之後，八一三之後，亦然；顧乃執迷不悟，自陷於欲罷不能之僵局，是固以事實暴露其國內之無一政家而有倒挽在瀾之仁勇者也。况放棄侵略而繫以夙不相涉之條件，是可視爲憬然省覺，幡然改圖乎？戲弄逆襲宣傳之技巧，猶視反唇相稽爲得計，則知三國所暗示之正常途徑，猶爲日本政家所不能善用也！</p>
<p>其實因緣於三國照會而遽望遠東局面之改觀，原屬奢望，前昨二日，美國國務卿赫爾氏之談話，以及倫敦泰晤士報之評論與其東京記者之電告，可謂洞察其隱矣。我人所不能釋然者：各國既深憾於日本之徒以空言搪塞，又明知日本當局亦能理解空言搪塞之不足以了事；顧乃猶不澈底確認空言搪塞乃爲空言抗議之必然報應，而不力行空言以外之有效辦法；此則無論在何觀點，要爲不經濟之甚。或以爲各國自分別對日抗議，進而爲分別對華援助，更進而對日作外交上之平行舉動，每一階段，皆經相當時間；則自外交上平行舉動之發端，以迄有效之實際辦法，亦必有其時間之距離焉。是屬誠然。於是而得以推想日本對於三國照會之反應者：乃爲充量利用其外交之時間，竭力擴展其侵略之空間。在中國則進行其軍事動作，以逞其覇佔與破壞之長；進行其政治動作，以盡其分化與麻醉之術；進行經濟動作，以償其搜刮與剝削之慾。在國際，則於外交與宣傳以及社會運動種種方面，利用國際之矛盾，各國國內區域間種族間之矛盾，政黨間階級間與農工業間以及新聞業間之矛盾，肆其威脅利誘，挑撥離間之伎倆，以分散國際平行舉動之力量。昨不聞日本有秘密團體名紫雲社者，在報紙刋登廣告，以恫嚇美國羅斯福總統乎；明知羅斯福總統决不爲恫嚇所屈而猶爲之，亦可見最近將來之日本，必無所不用其極矣。</p>

<h3>今年天花猖獗「發物」成問題</h3>
<p>— 尤學周</p>
<p>無論何種發疹之疾病當共疹子將透未透之時，輒覺中脘痞悶，煩躁懊憹，有莫可言宣之狀；及其旣透，卽覺稍舒，至完全透齊，方覺安適。故遇有發疹之疾病，如天花，痧子，水痘，猩紅熱等，皆以透發爲要事。天花一症，習俗有食發物者，其着眼點亦在促其速達：惟食物與用藥之透發法，其作用大不相同；而今歲流行之天痘，對於食發物一方，似不相宜，故特表而出之。</p>
<p>發物例分葷素二項，在天花見點之時，用素發；及其灌漿，則用葷發。素發之品，如冬筍·邊尖。香蕈·蔴菰之類：葷發之品，加魚湯。鷄湯·羊肉湯之類。素發之原理，不甚明瞭，大的取其鮮味，促進某種分泌，發生某種活動，疹子爲之加多：至於痘漿，全爲氣血所釀成，故氣血盛則漿足，氣血弱則漿薄，鷄湯之類，有滋補之效，能增益其氣血故也。</p>
<p>今歲流行之天花，其氣暴戾，其證屬實，以淸熱解毒爲要事，見點之際，不用發物，尚密佈無隙處，若再與以發物，無異抱薪救火矣。醫者於此時，例用荆芥。升麻。前胡等者，非盡以透發爲能事，蓋藥性中含有淸解之成分，與冬筍邊尖，道不同而不相爲侔，不可等量齊觀。在天花灌漿之時，以余之所見，多屬焦紫之形，漿之不足者，乃內熱壅滯所致，氣血虛弱之證，竟百不一見，淸解之不暇，尚敢囑病家飲以鷄湯羊肉湯等耶？卽病者有以可吾食發物見問者，亦必决然吾之，以防其生變。如屬氣血不足，漿淸不濁，庶可與以「葷發」之品，此則病家宜切切注意者！</p>
<h3>失眠症的治療</h3>
<p>— 葉勁秋</p>
<p>說起失眠，眞是很苦痛的，不曾經騐過的入簡直想像不出來。「寤寐求之，輾轉反側」，這是有所懷念，以致廢寢忘餐。此類失眠，將來自有甜蜜的境界作爲補償。况且有所思而思的失眠，事實上比較還不致於十分狼狽。祗有神經衰弱的失眠，那種失神落魄的情景，眞是天下第一苦事。神經衰弱乃是近世的時代病，眞要修身養性的人，應該歸眞返璞，速離都市。因爲聲光的刺戟，五色的奪目，淫邪的誘惑，生活的迫人；便是年富力强的人們，也必致頭昏腦脹，耳目不明了。</p>
<p>神經衰弱的失眠者，以用腦過度的人爲多：它的現象是：愈到晚上愈精神，解衣上床了，各種雜念自會立刻紛至沓來，愈欲息念，愈不可能。那末數數自己的呼吸數，一會兒便胡思亂想起來了，好像一隻野馬，受不住束縛。聽聽鐘擺的滴搭聲，更其煩躁，難安枕蓆。一忽兒口乾了，一忽兒小便了，直到東方發白，精神疲乏已極，才能合眼，迷迷糊糊，恍恍惚惚地睡去。起身之後，沒精打睬，懶言懶語，厭聞聲息，易於發怒。筆者也是過來人，所以此中况味是最淸楚的</p>
<p>至於失眠的原因也很多，我國的方藥，並不如專用鎭靜藥的來得一致，有各各不同的成法。關於這，我想另外寫篇專文。現在所要介紹的，是神經衰弱的失眠症，比較多數有效的成方。這個成方：說起它，來頭大，源流長，便是漢時張仲景的黃連阿膠鷄子黃湯。藥用黃連，黃芩，白芍，阿膠，鷄子黃。內有不少膠質。神經衰弱，用膠性的藥去治，是不會不合法的，同病的人們，請試試吧！</p>
<h3>體質有寒有熱飲食宜如何調節</h3>
<p>— 嚴蒼山</p>
<p>人身體質禀賦，各有不同，大要可分爲寒熱二種，苟無醫藥常識，飲食隨性所嗜，每致寒熱偏勝，釀疾病於不知不覺之間，茲分別說明之：</p>
<p>（一）熱體之辨別法及飲食所忌　凡屬素體偏熱者：必大便多秘，小便多黃，嗜水果，及飲茶，冬日不甚畏寒，脈搏較平人鼓指有力，常易患齒痛。目痛·咽腫·喉疼·痔瘡·便血·油耳·熱癤·頭暈·面熱·睡則齘齒·風疹塊·夢遺·失眠·痰中帶紅：在女人每多帶下崩中諸患。見一二症於此，卽屬熱象，不必俱見也磊忌多食辣椒。油煎·香燥·羊肉·高粱酒，各種野味。至於簡單補品，如桂圓·紅棗。荔枝·鹿角膠·虎骨膠·別直參等，亦所禁忌。</p>
<p>（二）寒體辨法及飮食所忌凡屬素體偏寒者，大便易溏，小便清長，口不渴，食生冷則腹痛，或嘔吐淸水，交冬則咳嗽多痰，共且氣急，舌苔白滑，脈搏較平人爲緩，且按之無力，，動則自汗，雖在夏日，不喜風扇，此皆臟寒多濕之象也。忌多食石膏豆腐。海蜇皮·蚶子·螃蟹·牡蠣肉·甲魚·鰻鯉·白菜·鮮萊菔。茶豆·水果·黃酒等寒冷之物，至於簡便補品，如燕窩·銀耳·龜膠·阿膠·西洋參等，亦不相宜。</p>
<p>如無以上諸現象者，卽屬平人，飲食可以不拘，至於兩湖·山東·及川閩等處，素性喜辣，風士習慣使然，又當別論耳。</p>
<h3>傷風喉啞</h3>
<p>— 張贊臣</p>
<p>傷風僡後，聲啞不揚。其原因固山於傷風未清，邪熱留戀於肺管，以致病灶蔓延及於喉頭聲帶而爲發炎也。故咳嗽雖愈，而聲啞一時不易恢復。治療之法，可用鷄蛋白一二個，加靑葱（連白）數莖，同煎，和以飴糖少許服之，聲音即能漸漸開朗。蓋蛋白之性質味甘氣腥，微寒無毒，能入肺經，可療咽喉之腫痛，聲音之暗啞。傷寒論治咽中生瘡，聲不出者，亦乃鷄白苦酒之方，以其消腫痛而發聲音也。和以飴糖，能止渴潤肺，再加靑葱，以通陽氣，三物合用，適能奏消炎通痺之功，而聲帶得潤，故能恢復其固有之聲朗。且三物爲日常食飲佐膳之品，視之似無足輕重，然失音者服之，確有殊效。</p>
<h3>傷風發散品神仙粥</h3>
<p>— 孫宗海</p>
<p>入冬以來，氣候洹寒，易患傷風感冒等症。蓋以海上居室辦公處所，多裝置水汀火爐，溫煖如春，屋內戶外，氣候判若霄壤，稍一不愼，即易遭罹是症矣。况孤島居室，狹隘如鴿棚，家人多數團集一起，一人害病，全家傳染，精神經濟，兩均受苦。今有神仙粥者，專治感冒風奉。頭痛。骨疼。四時疫氣流行諸症。煮法簡便，盡人可食。當初得病時，服此即解。法用糯米半合，生姜五大片，淸水二碗，於沙鍋內煮一二滾，决入帶鬚大葱白五七個，煮至米熟，再加胡椒少許和勻，乘熟吃粥，或只吃粥湯，即於無風處睡，以出汗爲度。此以糯米扶正爲君，姜葱發散爲助，一補一散，而又以胡椒宜透，甚有意義；且屢用屢騐，决非尋常發表之劑可比也。名之曰神仙粥，誰曰不宜？</p>
<h3>瓦楞子</h3>
<p>— 張懷霖</p>
<p>『瓦楞子』俗稱馬蚶千，寗波產者佳，有大小兩種：大者名馬蚶；小者寗蚶。由秋至春，市上均有出售。性微寒，體氣寒冷者不宜食：消化力薄弱者不宜食。惟功能平肝補血，爲女科柔肝養肝之食品，佐餐時食其肉，入藥時則用其殼，煆後煎服。一般陰虛肝旺之體，時有頭暈耳鳴之疾者，食之最宜。瓦楞子滋陰養血，肝陽素旺之體，此物旣戢肝陽，又養血液，至爲相宜。</p>
<p>又瓦楞子性寒，虛寒不育之體質忌食，食之每作腹痛，是性寒之徵也。婦女月事臨期，亦宜戒食。</p>

<p>產地天然燕窩，產於南洋婆羅洲蘇門答臘等海島。逸志云，海濱涯岸，石齒嵯峨多洞壑，海燕千百成羣巢於洞中，自萬丹，巴城，三寶壠，竭力石，南旺，馬辰，貓釐把，實不下數十處，皆荷蘭之有力者掌握焉。天然燕窩，營巢於海外斷崖絕壁，如暹邏燕，毛燕是也。近來南洋爪哇等處，以天然採取甚齦難，有築室培養營巢，如龍牙燕，大峙燕是也。其色白嫩質鬆，因不見天日故也。其產額以婆羅洲爲最多。後來由此地方輸入我國，據十年前之統計，每年運入値銀有三百五十萬兩之多云。</p>
<p>形態　金絲燕，體如夜鷹，形似雨燕，身材較小於普通之燕，此金絲燕之形態也，燕窩者乃其唾液所營之窩也。</p>
<p>效用　味甘平無毒。（逢原）味甘淡平，大養肺陰，化痰止嗽，補而能淸，爲調理虛損勞瘵之聖藥，一切病之由於肺虛，不能淸肅下行者，用此皆可治之。開胃氣，已勞痢，益小兒痘疹，可入煎藥，或單煮汁服。（茶餘客話）能止小便數。（物理小識）壯陽益氣，和中開胃，添精補髓，潤肺止久瘧久瀉化癆涎。（食物宜忌）紅色者治血痢。（嶺南雜記）秋白梨一個去心，入燕窩一錢，先用滾水泡，再入冰糖一錢，蒸熟，每日早晨服下勿間斷，治老年痰喘神效。（文堂氣騐方）白燕窩二錢，人參四分，水十分，隔湯頓熟。徐徐食之，治噤口痢立效。（救生苦海）燕窩二錢冰糖錢半頓食數决。治老年瘧疾及久瘧小兒虛瘧胎熱。（試騐方）翻胃久吐，服入乳，兼吃燕窩而愈。（文堂集騐方）燕窩二錢，生黃蓍錢半，煎濃汁服，治小兒氣液不足，痘頂凹陷。（經騐方）暴而咳嗽，吐血乍北，以白燕窩與冰糖同煮，連服，取其平補肺胃，而無止截之患，惟胃中有痰濕者。令人欲吐，以其甜膩戀膈故也。（逢原）（完）</p>

<h3>傷寒症之病情變化及食養程序（續完）</h3>
<p>— 陳存仁</p>
<p>（丙）第三時期證象，寒熱往來不退，高低似有定時，熱勢的在百零二三度，兩耳漸漸發聾，目微赤，口微苦，咽略乾，目略眩，胸脇苦悶，默默不欲欽食，心煩不適。</p>
<p>此一時期，除上期發厥變化之外，症勢較爲平凡，但寒熱久延不退，令人焦急不安，傷寒症見此現象，須知病須延長。傷寒症第二時期，第三時期之病證，往往混合發作，均以不見神昏發厥者爲上。</p>
<p>（丁）第四時期證象：此時漸入逆　，寒熱依然不解，大便溏泄，腹滿而吐，腹隱隱痛，此種現象，體力顯然不支。即俗名漏底傷寒楚也。</p>
<p>（戊）第五時期證象：體力極度不支，昏昏沉沉，但欲睡眠，手足不甚溫暖，氣從口中吐出，大便亦有瀉泄，此時如泄止，手足暖爲佳象。蜷臥自煩，欲去衣被者，亦尚可治，汗出頭眩者，大不佳，瀉泄見血者，易死。</p>
<p>（己）第六時期證象：此時亦爲最凶惡現象，舌頭蜷入，較平時爲短，睪丸陰囊縮入不見，發厥煩躁，嘔吐作呃，甚至吐出蛔蟲，四肢厥逆，面色淸白，大便溏泄或便堅作黑色。</p>
<p>傷寒病情轉變，似有一定步驟，旣如上述，治療得宜，往往經過一二期至三四期而霍然全愈，五六期症象見者極鮮，故死亡者百不得十。耍在病家預知病情，長期抵抗，對醫生治療方針不可早夕變更。所謂『信仰即是力量，對自己不可疑懼體力不支，煩慮不絕。所謂『自信即能生存』。傷寒病魔每經『長期抵抗』。而病勢自然消滅。故『最後之勝利必屬於我』。目即使病至骨瘦如柴，但祗須食養得宜，反能易瘦爲肥，體力倍增勝於前時也。醫國醫人，其彷彿乎？</p>
<h3>忌口問題</h3>
<p>— 秦丙乙</p>
<p>國醫有忌口之說。以是饕餮之徒，以爲逆耳之話。要知忌口與疾病，確有極密切之關係，本刋揭櫫食養，筆者不敏，深慨病家之忽視忌口，請爲諸君一詳論之：</p>
<p>飲食入口，悉歸於肖，胃乃行使其化物之權能，泌糟粕而取菁華，以營養血脈，補益臟腑，胃之作用如此：食品之關係於人體，不綦重夫？在平人自然，况病人乎？抑有進者今夫淸水一泓，雜以赤即赤，雜以黑即黑，其變化固甚速也，食物之響應於胃府，響應於人體，亦焉能外此；但常人消化力强，不至遽釀劇變，若患病者則一發不可收拾矣！此忌口之所以不容不講也。大抵外感病須忌口凈盡，即穀食亦弗能輕進；緣穀食助胃氣，外感熱勢方盛，多進穀食，邪易膠著，熱不卽退。如霍亂愈後，例必挨餓，是明證也。至內傷諸病，範圍較廣：心病忌炙辛辣，肝病忌糯麵腥羶，脾病忌黏滯厚膩，肺病忌烟酒興奮，腎病忌蝦蟹刺激，皆彰明而較著者。又如癰疽瘡瘍，以及大病未復，最宜注意，吾則輕病轉重，重病入危，事有必至，理有固然者。要之，忌口一事，在積極方面，所以助藥力之進行：在消極方面，所以防病灶之擴大。幸讀者察焉。</p>

<h3>金融　供求兩稀　現金價穩定逾恒</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、穩定逾恒、交易之淸淡、在本年中尚屬初見、良以大戶多懷觀望態度、惟市價在淸淡中、略有起仆、大致先平繼跌、而後回漲、初以某金號進意雖濃、然以齊戶不稀、供求頭寸相平、市况缺乏變幻、繼而忽聞外滙受港電猛塞後、略帶鬆硬、且某錢兌業脫售心切、故乃一度破人二十元關內、後因某金號忽來吸購、加以供者不湧、致乃復告衝出二十元關外、結果一無軒輊、各方人心尚形平穩、銀樓飾金、卒未見更動、海關金豐中英純金等則再度微降、</p>
<p>烚赤大戶觀望不動</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）初無做開、迨至九時五十分方見某金號進錢兌業及現金號各五十兩、均二千零三元爲開盤價、（進者乃補上日之所出）、此後買方因聞外滙受港電猛塞後、略帶鬆硬、故而多審愼旁觀、因之更難做開、價則退留於二十元之間、後直至十時三刻許、因某錢兌業脫售心切、故乃貶價、售予銀樓帮五十兩、十七元爲低盤價、後又延至十一時一刻、再見錢兌業售予銀樓帮五十兩、十九元爲午收價、午後交易益見淸淡、僅在二時半、見銀樓帮售予金號五十兩、價二十二元、此後某號忽興賣意、直喊低至二十元、然難找進者、致未做開、故晚收價作二千零二十二元、與上日晚收價、一無軒輊、全天六元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千零三十元、收進二千零十五元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>銀樓飾金仍懸原價</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出均無更動、大同行老慶雲等仍懸原價二百零五元、新同行仍懸二百零三元、收進一百九十七元、</p>
<p>英純金續縮一便士</p>
<p>十八日倫敦電、英純金每盎司叉續縮一辦士、計退達七鎊八先令七辦七半、中央銀行之中國純金烚赤收買價亦降低至一千二百十三元三角、掛脾海關金亦低二釐、計二元三角九分七釐、上海掛準標金價亦隨跌七角、計一千二百零八元六角、</p>
<h3>外幣交易少　價亦步降</h3>
<p>咋日英純金跌一辦士、英美滙兌升二五、外匯需要稍殷、供給未暢、過程穩靜、趨勢微弱、烚赤交易未旺、大戶觀望、散戶稍有出籠了結、投機者恍惚未定、市價盤旋趨軟、外幣交易甚稀少、英金鎊需要甚殷、由外商銀行搜去穴百餘鎊、荷蘭票斐律濱票、市上稀少、價稍高昂、其他各幣微呈下降、過程平靜、趣勢稍軟、公會交易未做開、昨日市價、美金票價一分、香港票降三釐、新加坡票降一分、荷蘭票升三分、斐律濱票升二分、　大利票降一分、其他各幣、俱未更動、</p>
<h3>英印銀價再度下降</h3>
<p>十八日倫敦電、投機家賣出、缺少維持、交易有限、銀市尚平、牧盤後平而帶呆、最後有少數成交、做開買戶知足、大條銀近遠期均繼續下降、近期縮一八七五還期縮一二五、紐約銀電、美銀價依然有行無市、又孟買銀電、印銀市况尚平、現貨嫂未更動、近遠期俱續跌一安那、</p>
<h3>現貼步高</h3>
<p>昨滙劃票據貼現率、仍在逐步高昂中、每千元初爲三十七元、午刻略高至三十七元二角半、下午續稍盤上至三十七元七角半、最後三十七元半、比前日再高半元云、</p>
<h3>外滙港方拋售不衰　匯兌續昂英平美鬆</h3>
<p>滙市昨雖洋行結款仍繁但因港電賣意依然殷濃、、華商投機家亦有出籠、故局勢漸見穩定、然軋過則英平美鬆、乃英美滙兌軋長故也、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠續縮紐約現貨不動、倫敦生金跌一辨士、匯兌英對美續長五厘六、對法未更、對滬仍平、美對英又升二五、對法漲三七五、對滬如舊。中央掛牌各匯呆定如故、銀行早開現貨賣價英匯八辨士二九六八七五、美滙十六元一八七五、較之前收英縮〇一五六二五、美則無上落、開後雖大通大英荷蘭美行等爭扒現貨美匯十六元一二八七五、及匯豐麥加利購納現貨先令八辨士三一二五、但以港電一再力塞、兼之華銀行亦起賣予有利正月份先令亦爲八辨士三一二五、故潛勢稍硬、滙豐掛牌揭曉勿動、白銀平衡稅揭曉續縮一分二五、此後洋行界扒進滙豐麥加利現貨先令僅八辨士二八一二五、並又購結荷蘭大通現貨美匯祗十穴元一八七五、加之華義·安達·荷蘭競相吸進錢兌業現貨港滙五十五元七五、於是形勢逐步轉平、午收英金八辨士三一二五、美金十六元二一八七五、</p>
<p>後市雖華比美行大通荷蘭吃胃仍健、繼續購進現貨先令八辨士三一二五及現貨美匯十六元二一八七五、無如因港電賣意始終不衰、故爲狀趨鬆、最後洋行又向大英扒進現貨先令八辨士二五、加之銀行供源不暢、而吃胃較健、華比荷蘭吃進現貨港匯五十五元七五、致趨勢復歸平穩、晚收銀行賣價英匯八辨士三乙二五、美滙爲十穴元二一八七五、結果較前收英平美長〇三一二五、港滙照上日成交價軋縮二五、</p>
<h3>銀錢業皆大發財　靠政府客戶逃難人之福惠　倒是絕大一筆戰時利得稅</h3>
<p>民國二十七年匯豐銀行固大發其財、即有利華比等銀行、亦無一不發其財、不但洋銀行發財、即華銀行亦無一家不發財、又不獨華銀行發財、即錢莊允其是四川路江西路一帶小錢莊、亦無一不發其財、多者千萬或數百萬元、少者數十萬元、銀行經理董事人人大笑、銀行職員則有哭有笑、亦有哭笑不得、在洋銀行行員、月月有盈餘可得、外匯可派、靠了洋東福、其實還是靠政府的福、故無一不笑逐顏開、華銀行行員在先以國難為名、裁員减薪、七折八扣、無一不感覺苦痛、然亦有得銀行當局的靑睞、暗中另有津貼、吃肉者吃肉、吃骨者吃骨、苦樂不勻、哭笑不得、亦比比有之、</p>
<p>此滾滾法幣從何而來、（一）是外匯、此「外匯」兩字中、是銀行</p>
<p>界發財的終南捷徑、只要將法定滙價與黑牌匯價一爲比較、就可知道、何况「得風氣之先」隨時買進賣出乎、（二）限制提存、推行匯劉、其用意原在維護金融、不料竟爲生財大道、買賣法幣、貼現奇昂、此中賺頭、難以勝計、（三）房地產交易、因逃難集中滬上、驟見活動、如某銀行一家六月一個月中做成此項交易六百萬元、其他可知矣、（四）買賣黃金、去年又是上山勢、做一筆賺一筆、只管買、只管賣、一出一入、一條金子不講盈餘、但問經手費已有十餘元矣、（五）做北方天津等處匯兌者、因「僞鈔」及法幣間之差、予以絕大牟利之機會、（六）存款激增、去年逃滬之難民、大都爲內地之富滬、狹巨款以俱來、皆以銀行爲存放之地、一面因人口激增、市面畸形繁榮、銀行藉此出納、以資利用、叨光匪細、</p>
<p>於是銀行錢莊發財矣、財從何而來、所靠者爲誰、政府維護法定匯率之賜、與往來客戶之助也、所爲益於國者有幾、僅爲一筆戰時利得稅、但需一秉至公、照額徵收、然而又將以戰時損失作帳面之遮眼法、爲其逃走也、</p>
<h3>紗花　囤戶收藏愈熱烈　紗價再漲六七元</h3>
<p>紗市愈堅、漲風尤熾、良以實需雖無躉批發展、但比上日爲增加、而各帮顯有活動之象、滇帮購辦續而不斷、贛帮買胃尤强、市態更形挺拔、至於同會及囤戶心意本屬觀高、得此實銷扶植、在市吸收倍蓰濃烈、因之市價力邁步前進、經記者再四調査所得、通來一般經濟富裕者、囤藏棉紗何以如此熱烈、據大衆意見、其（一）謂原料被某方壟斷、前途無下落希望、紡織二十支紗之原棉、每擔價須合八十元可馬秤、三擔半製造一句紗、成本方面須合二百八十元、再加各種開繳雜費等五十元、再加統稅十元、凈價共計三百四十元、照目前之紗價三百九十元、僅有四十元餘利、（二）則證券市况飄忽不定、放出公債、掉進棉紗者頗多、有此二大原因、市面堅持不鬆、前途是吾繼續前進、穿出上决四百零三元之高價、仍恃客銷來推動也、</p>
<p>查昨日現紗市場情形、晨初開盤因客帮實需有活動消息、雲南帮有電來辦貨、囤戶活動力愈見强盛、二十支雙馬開價即跳八元半、爲三百九十三元半、同行成交三十包、少頃汕頭帮亦來進二十包、再加五角、人氣緊悄、旋以價高之後、有一部份獲利者趁漲出檔、然大戶仍吸收、稍見回挫、雙馬做至三百九十一元、繼以同業依然收進、又復回昂、收盤一十支雙馬價三百九十二元、結果上午成交一千四百二十七包、行情雙馬價漲七元、特金城漲七元、雙地球漲六元、天女漲六元牛、十支粗紗漲三元、廠方由永安廠開出二十支持金城五十包、價為三百九十七元、鴻章廠開出十支實彝二百包、價爲二百八十五元、大生廠開出十支紅魁星一百包、價由二百七十七元至七十五元、午後消息、統益廠開出二十支金鷄三百九十三元、十支金鷄三百零二元、共計二百餘包、雲南辦去、茲將各帮買去額量誌後、</p>
<p>同行　九八七　江西　二三〇</p>
<p>雲南　一二五　內地　九〇</p>
<p>福州　一五　汕頭　二〇</p>
<p>合計　一、四二七</p>
<p>日紗市場跟踪華紗上騰、但　需依然不暢、本月份皮球交易較爲熱關、二十支水月現紗價爲三百十四元、本月份價爲三百十二三元、二十支藍鳳三百十一元、本月份三百十元至〇八元半、比上日漲二·三元不等、四二支·三二支·氣勢尤緊、</p>
<h3>細絨銷路驟起　白包花售價獨昂</h3>
<p>本棉生意轉趨暢盛、呆滯已久之天津細絨棉、昨則驟形發動、惟額量旣稀、而係花號購進、抵解拋空之廠額、日廠仍購訂印棉七百件、係三二支原料、價格僅八十八元外、華商　永安進打包花二百件、統一廠進姚衣一千包、其餘廠家依然沉悶如前、惟同業進出尚稱熱鬧行情平靜、與上日無甚軒輊、惟白包花售價仍挺秀、棉市就大勢測之、價格已達漲無再漲之境、然北路來源絕跡、所以中外各廠購辦美印棉有增無减、碼頭上到通花與細絨一千五百包、新港來三百九十件、北沙來二百五十件、未曾開出、茲將現棉成交額量並市盤列左、</p>
<h3>美棉產額難解决　擬召集世界棉產會議　美棉市價因之而呆滯</h3>
<p>外棉市價、在華盛頓舉行之國議會及前日起舉行之棉產區議員會議、殊爲世界棉業界人士所注意、棉產區議員會議因棉產過剩問題之嚴重、解決非易、故昨日起暫行停止會議、稍待數日後再行續開、美農部秘書亨利威爾斯、因觀及美棉過剩問題、絕非美政府自身所能解决、現擬試行召開世界各棉產國之國際性棉產會議、共同商討如何處置此項過剩之貸款存棉、及今後之棉業政策等諸問題、近日布疋仍屬暢銷、前昨二日共售出六百萬碼之多、故日來各廠進胃健旺異常、然國會所討論猶未解决、市價因之呆滯殊甚、昨紐的漲跌互見、印度連同預測跌半　比、埃及漲三五磅音、昨匯兌堅定、折合法幣棉價俱跌、計美棉及巴西棉每擔跌七角、埃及跌九角、印棉跌三角、</p>
<p>本市外棉交易、因火機價格之高昂、且來源稀少、包額不能多做、故連日各廠開進平果兒奧默拉甚多、咋日申新父進印棉白洛區七百包、可紡三十二支之用、送廠價爲八十八元二角半、茲錄成交額於後、</p>
<p>申新　進印棉　七百包</p>
<p>同興　又　五百包</p>
<p>公大　又　五百包</p>
<p>內外　進美棉　一千包</p>
<h3>疋頭　東疋漲風愈演愈烈　投機突起奇貨可居　行盤步騰添辦未已</h3>
<p>國布　昨以東疋漲風變本加厲、華廠坯布價亦騰漲、影響色布成本、售盤一致提升、人氣向昂、需胃益濃、遠近客路添單不絕、甬帮及浙東內地原件及白布拆件昨裝出五百餘件、甌帮及浙贛沿鐵路亦達四百件外、均以藍布雜色斜紋土布爲大宗、印花貨漂布原布購辦亦夥、川滇帮亦有進展、購內衣廠九磅粗布。八四原布。孔雀細布。等貨一百餘件、漂布·藍布·色斜·府綢·印花貨·三千餘疋、海口帮進色斜三十箱、細斜三十包、香港帮進十二磅三兔粗斜念包、十六磅粗斜九磅粗布·細斜·四十餘包、閩省洋口沙縣興化泉州各地辦元色雜色斜紋嗶嘰二千數百疋、汕頭帮辦細斜細布色布漂布二百餘件、售盤印染漂白布漲起每疋一角至三角、白貨惟八四布漲一角、粗細布粗細斜紋價價仍平平、走勢已稍活動、白貨繼續挺秀、</p>
<p>東布</p>
<p>銷路日盛、昨細布細斜售盤步騰、如龍頭與彩球兩牌細布、收市行情每疋須十一元四角、而行盤每疋猶高出一角外、全日訂開龍頭。彩球·飛魚·喇叭·雙魚·等細布綜計現期貨達二千件左右、又陽鶴·龍頭·寶貝。細斜開出亦有四五百件、雖由同業心思高昂、進胃濃厚所致、但尚有一部份業外囤戶、鑒於東疋之走勢活躍、進出便利、投機者亦不乏人、故除各洋行開售期貨外、市塲現貨買賣亦甚熱鬧、本街染銷及同行互售亦有一千五六百件之譜、天津帮進意更佳、續辦各牌細布細斜一千餘件、行廠咸拉緊盤子、奇貨可居、八四飛魚等牌原布昨亦提漲一二角、輸運出口、昨有中外疋頭四百五十四件運往天津、</p>
<h3>糧食　定麥到滬聲中　粉成互擯局面　麥呈不支之狀</h3>
<p>粉昨現銷客胃續减、南北兩帮、均以前辦之貨、尚未裝淸、更兼廠家定麥到滬後、原料漸充、購戶均思抑價辦進、廠方則思扳持原盤、尚不過於遷就、致雙方互擯、結果除本街以原盤打出各牌二號粉的七千餘包外、其餘客化僅二三百包與一二千包之零星點綴交易、外傳回籠貨售價、有修小之說、故市面已呈暗鬆之象、至現粉出口、昨有二萬一千包、運往天津、今日亦有一千包運津、七千包運往烟臺、</p>
<p>麥昨市已呈不支狀態、査車輪來源、各有二千來包、內由新港來一千二百包、廠方以洋麥定貨、踵接而至、對於國麥、雖尚　要、但吃盤已見重視、貨方則以販運困難成本依然高昂、尚圖掙扎、結果已修小三四分、計開江北浦鎭蕪湖等麥共五千包、福新廠辦去三千包、阜覽廠辦去二千包、最高價六元六角七分、洋麥定貨到滬聲中、國麥前途、已受相當影響云、</p>
<h3>客秈車輪到源旺　粳米人心亦餒</h3>
<p>客秈　有本客趁低收買、市面頗呈興旺氣象、然車輪到源均湧、除京蕪鎭江各秈外、又由滸浦來一千五百包、台州機秈亦新到三千包、因此中决貨續小近角、高貨亦帶軟數分、南京高秈喊十一元、而市上只開十元○九角、新到之台秈貨品雖比前到爲佳、行情亦祗十元〇三角、鎭江秈十允〇八角、蕪秈十元〇六角半至十元左右不等、統市成交二千多包、</p>
<p>粳米　來源河下未到、而輪車包子頗夥、共有一萬餘包”而前兩朝途中遭受雨漬者、數亦不少、售方未免心餒、都抱速脫之意、更以本街及囤戶見到源稍多、心思亦定、致市况與前市大相懸殊、形勢頓軟、市面立即向下、結果厚薄粳悉小角許、杜洋尖埠尖亦難立足、跌落幾分至一角、獨變元貨稀熱令、尚堅定</p>
<h3>雜項　麻袋缺貨　售價日昂</h3>
<p>本市糖米雜糧所需之麻袋、向恃印度運來、及滙兌緊縮、來源逐减、而本埠製袋工廠、規模較大者、僅有日商一家、但須供給該國軍需、而市存舊袋、曾先後被華軍日軍大量收買、因此商人需用常感不足、目下藍綫單嘜大市貨售價每千只已至七百五十元、單嘜冲新須每千只八百五十元、較之八一三前、每千只四五百元者、相差甚鉅、</p>
<h3>海味　螟蜅一批　新由港帮辦去</h3>
<p>螟蜅因到存兩缺、去路暢動、聞本期批亞士輪父裝去一批、爲港帮所辦、故市勢昂貴、如舟山蜅上莊須六十八元至六十五元、寗波蜅普通三十三元、新貨三十四五元、山東貨四十八元至五十元、比前各升三五元不一、</p>
<h3>雜糧　芝麻昂俏　隨到隨銷</h3>
<p>芝蔴暗盤市面仍挺秀、良以販運困難、來源日少、底積空虛、隨到隨銷、市况直上靑雲、昨市聞洋莊凈貨芝麻、會開至二十一元五角、因無貨供應、上騰之氣熖頗熾云、</p>
<h3>藥材　正杏仁去路零星</h3>
<p>正杏仁來自靑島、專銷藥業近以交易零星、市勢平疲、查前盤每擔爲八十元、昨某號開出、跌售七十五元、比前小去五元、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲經騰漲速率　不及乾繭</h3>
<p>昨日絲市、國外堅穩、紐的橫濱晨市各較前日略小、計紐的現貨跌一分、遠期小半分、橫濱現貨小四元、遠期跌二元、然至下午、橫濱收盤又飛躍一〇—一二元許、本埠交易淸堅、白廠經七八分新高價、仍未開出、蓋東市激漲、使申市改良乾繭躍升二十元、（三二〇—三三〇元）、如照此推算、白廠絲市應高漲八十元、（以繅折四〇〇斤計）、然絲市騰漲之速率、並未及此、故白廠交易暫告僵持、祇高級細條份絲、有英莊去路、價至昂貴、七星等級一三——一五售一五三〇元、即其例證、其他美莊及印莊輯里絲、邇日來深覺活躍、價亦隨漲一〇——二〇元、昨共成交五〇擔、</p>
<p>昨有絲頭一百桶、運往意國、</p>

<h3>倫敦中國債券　業已回漲　日本債券　一蹶不振</h3>
<p>快訊社訊、據本埠英商之權威方面消息、本星期一（即十六日）倫敦證券市塲開市時、因中國政府方面宜佈、日本刦持游擊區關稅、停止冉由中央銀行透支墊付、因之以關稅爲担保之外債債券、跌落五磅至一磅半之鉅、惟市塲上持有中國債券之持券人、均深信中國經濟基礎穩固、戰局亦趨好轉、故無一人拋出、英商於昨晨又接獲英倫電訊、本星二（十七日）市塲上並無上落、亦無交易、至昨日（十八日）終又回漲、計有英德四厘半借款（英發）飛漲二磅、善後五厘公債、回漲一磅半、至日本債券、於本星期一各跌落一磅半後、前昨二日均未回漲絲毫、此實足以證明中國政府此種對策、雖遭一時反動、但對於中國整個之國家經濟、實更有利也、</p>

<h3>財政部　决心維持債信　此次通告實為世理這常　統一復興照常十足付款</h3>
<p>財政部决心維持債信、國債基金管理委員會照常辦理抽籤還本、本月底到期之統一、二月底到期之復興、改在重慶十足付款、此决通告、關稅担保各債、不再透支、實爲世理之常、上海債市、已趨穩定、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>政府决心　维持债信</p>
<p>我國政府雖在戰時財政極度緊張之下、仍始終維持債信、故年來內外各債、時價均極堅挺、自財政部通告海關、担保各債務不再通融透支、市塲誤解、舉凡外滙·债市·金市·紗花·均呈激烈之反映、而本週一外滙與黃金價格之猛烈上升、允見市塲之虛驚妄動、政府對於償付債務、歷來按期履行、往昔雖因天災人禍與經濟恐慌、稅收偶有短絀、不敷撥償然政府必挪墊鉅款按期償付、中央銀行透支之數、達一萬七千五百萬元之鉅、則可知政府財政政策之健全、與維持債信之决心、</p>
<p>税收被刦　停止透支</p>
<p>過去一年、關稅收入、並未如何减少、已有專款而不繳解、政府仍然通融透支、其顧全債信、已超出一般世情之上、而與日本方面之刦持稅款、兩相映照、允見政府態度之偉大債券已有專款、與有担保而收入不足者不同、刻並有因担保而積成之鉅額專款、則政府最近之停止通融透支、實爲世理之常、自英日雙方公佈之海關協定、稅款移交日方、我政府曾向英提出抗議、所以造成今日一部分債息基金之無着、中外人士其亦有所覺悟而知其責任之所在歟、</p>
<p>國內公債　抽籤還本</p>
<p>政府應付此種事態、至爲確當、除通告海關担保各債務不再通融透支外、復聲明嗣後對於海關担保各項長期債務、凡在戰前訂借而尚未消償者、當就戰區外各關稅收比例應攤之類、按期撥交中央銀行、專款存儲、並謂戰區各關、將已存欠繳之應攤債賠款、嗣後稅收應攤照舊解交總稅務司時、仍舊撥付債賠各款基金、是叉可知政府維持債信之態度、關於內債之抽籤還本事宜、决由國債基金管理委員會照常舉行、二月十日應抽之公債、爲統一公債甲種債票、</p>
<p>統一復興　十足付款</p>
<p>一月三十一日到期統一公債甲乙丙丁戊五種債票及二月二十八日到期復興公債本息、中央銀行已奉總行令、准期由重慶中央總行十足付款、惟爲便利上海持券人起見、特准上海中中交三行代爲經付、惟分六期付淸、每期爲一個月、並頒佈上海分期付款之細則、聞中央上海分行將轉知中國。交通。兩地分行及中央信託局上海辦事處查照辦理、至於三月三十一日到期民國十七年金融長期公債息四二一·八七五元、本一·一二五·〇〇〇元、償付辦法、中央銀行尚未奉到部令、</p>
<p>人心已安　債市趨穩</p>
<p>自財政部决心維持債信後、上海之非正式交易市塲昨日之債市、已趨穩定、日改在重慶總行付款、證明並非愆期、此項行將到期之統一與復興兩種公債、均照常十足償付本息　於是市塲上人心已安、昨日收　甲種五十六元三角五分、乙種四十九元九角、丙種叫十八元八角五分、丁種四十八元一角、戊種四十八元三角五分、與前日比較漲起自一角五分至五角不等、</p>

<p>滬西形勢、近因華軍游擊隊之活躍、更形緊張、據昨日由滬西到滬之一般華人方面探悉、前日（十七日）上午、沿靑滬公路之徐涇鎭日軍四名、又爲華方游擊隊擊斃、日方乃於昨晨起、由滬派出日軍百餘名、大舉搜索、沿虹橋路之程家橋、曾有游擊隊前往、逮捕</p>
<p>漢奸一名</p>
<p>前日（十八日）在租界西區以外之虹橋路、日本同文書院以東之工部局花園附近、爲游擊隊擊斃便衣日人一名、據外人方面消息、十八日下午、有一台灣入、僱卡車一輛、爲日軍運米、行至虹橋路之</p>
<p>苗圃附近</p>
<p>處、忽遇華方游擊隊一隊、各坐脚踏車而來、當即喝令該卡車停駛、中國游擊隊、除將米及卡車取去外、幷將該台人槍傷、至於與該台人同車之華人、則並不加害、事後、日軍乃在虹橋戒嚴、但華軍遊擊隊、已從容退去、於此可信華方遊擊隊、顯</p>
<p>逼近租界</p>
<p>西區外之地域、是以滬西日軍、極形恐惶、乃於昨晨（十九日）八時、由市中心區調出日軍的四五百名、及坦克車鐵甲車並携小鋼砲多尊、在中山路·林肯路·白利南路·虹橋路一帶、作野戰演習示威、將繼續數日之久、其演習之地段、適在英國及法國防區附近之處、而其操演之時間、則爲自上午八時至十時、</p>

<h3>工部局納稅人　責難加薪事件　警務與消防力量薄弱　厚俸者加薪尤為不當　納況人等將有所行動</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、關於工部局加薪事、納稅人與其他居民交換各項意見、有建議工部局應撥若干款項、雇用巡捕消防員與公共事務人員、而不應對已得厚俸之主要職員、續加巨薪、致糜費款項、並已着手任公衆調査整個事件之籌備事宜、彼等復</p>
<p>詆責局方</p>
<p>之分職員成不同等級、乃欲使職員間無聯合行動、更恥笑工部局所奉「聯合一體」之格言、枇評局方减薪裁員等事、局方前曾設經濟委員會、將救火會之人員與設備兩方面减裁至安全標準以下、致去冬火警頻繁時、不得不招用訓練未純熟之人、</p>
<p>協助工作</p>
<p>局方猶自鳴得意、謂節省逾一百萬元、但其結果、公共租界西區工廠林立、其計劃均須經工部局檢査、公務處與救火會以人員减少、致甚忙碌、爲前所未見、待此等工廠建築時、復無</p>
<p>充量巡捕</p>
<p>監視或阻止其未經核准而添造房屋、但因未能阻止故未經核准之房屋、確有建造、一旦失愼、救火會灌救不易、上星期六、愛多亞路之火焚慘事、即其一例、至於警務處界外馬路之不能充量保護、已歷數年、該區中捕房之警力薄弱、至少已有七年，今則不得不自</p>
<p>其他捕房</p>
<p>借調大批人員、俾在滬西巡邏、如蘇州河北區果開放、則警務處之人員不足、將爲重大之障碍、但工部局或並不異常關心此事、因蘇州河以南區域、已得鉅大之收入也、故納稅人及其居民之意見、以爲少數厚俸者加薪、其所費六十萬元、應加予薪俸較少之職員、或添雇人員、今爲納稅人有所行動之時、彼等已成立一團體開始工作、定名爲工部局納稅人調査委員會、</p>

<h3>臺糖私運進口　已獲事實證明　經海關檢驗者僅二萬擔　日報謂有一百萬入滬</h3>
<p>大陸報云、由海關統制而輸入臺糖之數量、昨（十八日）向江海關統計處獲得確切情報、藉悉自一月一日至十七日、臺糖經海關而輸入者、僅十一萬公斤、的値七萬七千海關金單位、而於去歲全年、臺糖經江海關檢騐而輸入者、僅值二千零四十海關金單位的計三千公斤、兩者共計的十一萬五千公斤、合</p>
<p>二萬擔左右</p>
<p>但據一月十一日本埠日文大陸新報所載、臺糖之已輸入本埠者、的計一百萬担、則未經海關而輸入者、達九十八萬担之巨、此數即爲臺糖私運入滬之數額、今可無疑、而大陸新報所傳輸入臺糖一百萬担、當然絕對眞實、本月十三日、日方發言人在招待記者席上曾稱前文揭發私運臺糖入滬、非以正確計數爲根據、而</p>
<p>此大量臺糖</p>
<p>乃在上月下旬運滬云云、但上月份海關報告、並未載有臺糖輸入、日方發言人先謂加以調查、旋稱該糖行將由江海關檢騐、然此言與大陸新報所傳一百萬斤臺糖業已輸入上海之消息、顯相矛盾、大陸新報所載、固絕對眞實、毫無疑義、據本埠海關報告，去年十一月輸入臺糖極少、自一月一日起始較增多、但自去年二月起臺糖即</p>
<p>已在滬傾銷</p>
<p>日虹口以及京滬杭全區均有臺糖零躉批發、甚且私運入兩租界、數日前、記者曾晤運爪哇糖來滬銷售之荷蘭商行各人員彼等均稱臺糖私運來滬、已使本埠之爪哇糖貿易、一蹶不振、故毫糖</p>
<p>九十八萬擔</p>
<p>之私運至滬、已屬事實、此大量臺糖、的値一千六百萬元、其應付而未付之關稅、達數百萬元之鉅　本埠外國記者等有疑日方招待記者席上之舌人、未能確達其「主人」之言者、至此似可釋疑矣、</p>

<h3>節約獻金進言</h3>
<p>— 陳傑</p>
<p>國家民族已到生死存亡的關頭　不容有絲毫輕忽和人事的曠廢　吝惜錢財不獻金雞免陷子孫爲奴</p>
<p>親愛的患難的同胞們：</p>
<p>祖國神聖的民族自衛戰爭，已經轟轟烈烈地進行了十八個月，除了那些喪心病在與冷血的衣冠禽獸之外，凡是大中華民國的國民，沒有一個人不迫切地渴望着最後勝利的來臨，可是這個艱苦偉大的任務，决不是空談，或是依賴別人所能有濟於事的，必須每一個同胞，確切地爲着這個目標盡最大的力量，纔能達到成功的境地，完成歷史上空前的任務！</p>
<p>國家是由每一個同胞組織成功的，換句話說，國家是每個同胞都有份的，我們决不可徒責前綫將士去拼命　敵，而忘記了自己的責任，我們雖未能直接去執戈殺敵，捍衛國家，但是最低限度，必須要儘量一貢獻一點經濟力量，實行抗戰一建國過程中「有錢出錢，有力出力」的原則，去支持這决定国國家存亡的長期抗戰，我們明知處在目前的環境當中，我們這菲薄的收入，僅足湖口，但是我勻與更明白，現在確實是國家民族生死存亡的關頭，不容有一絲一毫的輕忽因循，更不容有一人一事的曠廢和遲緩，必須集中全國同胞的人力物力，共同去驅逐强暴的敵虜，所以我們雖是貧困，但一想到國家興亡匹夫匹婦與有責焉的明訓，而且個人事小，國家事大，就命很願意的在刻苦的生活中再從事刻苦節的，無論所得多少，完全奉獻予國家，略盡國民的天職！</p>
<p>我們切不要以爲僩人的力量很是微細，對於大局是無所裨益，這是一種諉卸責任的卑鄙藉口，誠不知出一分力量就有一分效果，我們四萬萬五千萬同胞，假使每人拿出一分錢就可換得五千六百餘發子彈，假設每人拿出一角就可換得一千餘輛坦克車，假設每人拿出一元就可換得二千餘架戰鬭飛機，這樣的力量還能算小嗎？所謂聚沙爲塔集腋成裘，就是積少可以成多的明訓·</p>
<p>我們切勿自作聰明，以爲抗戰救國，自有別人去幹，我可不必過問，且圖眼前的個人安逸與享受，此乃生就奴性最爲可恥的敗壞思想，誠不知國家若然滅亡，個人和子子孫孫只有過着奴隸牛馬般的生活，决無自由享受的生存餘地，猶太人不是世界上著名的富足民族嗎？但是猶太人不能因其富裕而能換得安定的生活，却相反地流亡異域，過着流離失所非人的生活，時常被人驅逐欺壓，非特不能享受安逸，甚至連生命都沒有保障呢！這不是很可證明亡國奴是絕對沒有自由與安逸的享受的嗎？猶太人，和其他亡了國的民族，未嘗不天天在呑聲飲泣的悽慘境遇之下掙扎，想作光復祖國的偉業，但是可憐他們已經被緊緊的束縛住了，當他們的國家在被侵略的時候，他們的祖先因爲沒有抵抗的决心，不肯犧牲個人的財資去維護國家的生存，以致子孫永陷在奴隸坑中，不能超生，追根究源，都是因爲他們的祖先貪圖暫時的安逸，鑄成大錯，親愛的同胞！他們爲了一念之差致貽子孫千古之恨，我們興念及此，能不令人毛骨悚然而不寒而慄嗎？現在我們還有衛國的機會，我們的最高領袖蔣委員長，正在領導全國的同胞，作長期的抗戰，予打擊者以打擊，且敵人的泥足已愈陷愈深，崩潰之日，指日可望，我們最後勝利的關鍵，已繫於千鈞一髮之際，難道忍願做亡國奴，而錯過這復興民族僅有的機會嗎？親愛的同胞們!富足的同胞呀!快點醒悟吧!不要只圖個人的安樂了，不要吝惜錢財勝過愛護國家了，吾則你們也應該替你們的子孫打算打算·</p>
<p>在前綫浴血抗戰視死如歸的將士，把他們血肉之軀·去抵擋敵人的槍砲！把他們最實貴的生命都貢獻給國家民族，爲的是什麽？不過爲了要捍衛祖宗所遺留下來的錦繡河山！我們也是國民的一份子，難道忍心袖手旁觀，諉棄對於國家應負的責任嗎？不！决不！爲了中華民族的獨立自由！爲了洗雪以往的恥辱，爲了濟算被殺同胞與捍衛祖國而犧牲的忠勇將士們的血賬，我們要拿出每個人汗血所凝成的力量，我們應該確立志願努力履行節的獻金，記着：多出一分力量，就能增强一分勝利的把握，我們要把我們四萬萬五千萬同胞的力量，凝成一個嶄新的獨立自由的新中國！</p>

<h3>上海特輯　抗戰中之上海學校　教育　崇淦</h3>
<p>上海爲中國第一大都會，面積四九，四六九方公里。據戰前統計，擁有三，二六四，二二九人口，不僅爲全國工商業及經濟之中心，敎育文化事業之發達，亦幾爲全國冠。抗戰開始後，因地處衝要，首陷戰區，敎育文化機關之遭受砲火摧殘者，損失雖尙無統計，堪稱空前浩刧，所幸敎育行政當局暨各級敎育人員，咸能公忠體國，艱苦支撑，其陷於戰區之學校，於可能範圍內已有一部份遷入租界開學，其原在租界者，則弦歌未輟，以迄於今，復以滬市戰後人口之激增，就學青年之衆多，應社會之需要而所設之學校亦屬不少。其他如由於戰區之擴大，隣境各省學校之遷滬復校者亦有多所，凡此種種，皆足以勉維敎育命脈於不替。茲就高等敎育，中等敎育，初等敎育，及義務敎育等各方面略述其抗戰中之槪况，以吿關心抗戰時期之上海敎育者。</p>
<p>一·高等敎育</p>
<p>上海全市專科以上學校，在戰前共有三十一所，茲表列於左：</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>抗戰與自由</h3>
<p>— 白櫻</p>
<p>美國的作家Roger　William　Ries，最近在美國「論壇」雜誌上發表了一篇題名「自由之理想」（The　Ideal　of　Liberty）的短文，他的開頭幾句話，頗堪我們玩味。他說美國哥倫比亞大學的一位教授，曾將下面的一段話引來問一輩羣眾：</p>
<p>國家及其機構，是屬於一國的國民的。無論在什麼時候，他們感到對現存的政府發生厭倦時，他們可以運用他們的憲法權來加以修改，或以他們的革命權來把政府推翻。</p>
<p>他問說，上面這段話是否「赤色」。聽眾中有人認為這話不出於列寗定出於史太林，他們並且表示非常憎惡。及至他告訴他們這段話原是林肯說的，聽眾才首肯，認為這是真理。　　美國是個現世界中人民得以自由思想，自由言論的少數民主國家之一。但我們在上述的例子中，可以看出美國的人民——至少一部分——還沒有獲得真正的自由，因為在他們的思想中，還有一種自由之敵的偏見觀念存在，如果這段話不是林肯說的，而是列寗或史太林說的，他們就表示憎惡，這種態度，就是表示他們無論在思想上，言論上尚不能獲得自由的真諦。</p>
<p>不過這並不是說美國沒有自由。美國是現世界中給與人民最充分自由的國家之一。原來自由這一概念，如果離開了實踐的認識論來理解，這自由是空的，是偽自由。美國的一小部分人（其他國家亦然），因為受法西斯蒂宣傳的毒害，致視斯太林和列寗的話是不可信的，他們在人事的偏見上來尋求真理，結果反糟蹋了他們能享受且應該享受的自由。</p>
<p>我們曉得美國是個高度資本主義的國家，這里所重視的自由，是個人的自由。他們相信民主主義的自由，是在盡量發展個人的自由。這如基督教的相信發展個人的善性的一面，就可造成人間世界為地上的樂園一樣。但這種太重個人的自由觀，是頗有批判的余地的。</p>
<p>唯物論的哲學告訴我們，自由的範疇，是和實踐的認識保持著相對的關係。我們的實踐認識愈深，我們的自由境界愈大。但所謂實踐的認識，是指循著真理而進的認識而言。認識與自由的關係，也同樣適用於認識和真理的關係。</p>
<p>若果脫離了一定程度的真理範疇，而僅偏重於個人自由的發展，則個人的自由，一定會得碰壁，如前述的美國情形，就是一例。</p>
<p>在抗戰中的中國情形，就恰好相反。在抗戰中的中國人民，個人的自由，好像頗受拘束。許多在戰場上犧牲生命的戰士，不獨是個人的自由，且連個人的生命都喪失了。國際間的一般偽和平主義的反對一切戰爭的論調，就是從這種個人的觀點出發的。</p>
<p>其實在抗戰中我們所失去的自由，只是偽的自由而已。而我們流著血在爭取中的，才是真正的自由——真理。一個民族在外敵侵略之下，整個民族就無自由可言，更那裏談得到個人的自由。但唯其抗戰是為真理的廝爭，為民族的真正自由和生存搏廝，是真理範疇的認識之實踐，所以在抗戰過程中及其最後所獲得的自由，才是人類的真正自由。</p>
<p>舉一個實例作本文的結論佐證：我們理知地自省一下，最重要的言論自由和思想自由，抗戰前與抗戰後，豈非有了驚人的進展？這就是抗戰給我們自由的一個鐵的保證。</p>
<h3>永不屈膝</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>一個平凡的故事</h3>
<p>— 胡侃</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>當戰爭的洪流，快蔓延到x莊的時候，全村曾大大地騷動了一次，大家企圖避免這支瀰漫著的洪流，巴望這一支洪流不要流到這兒來。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>——早！福根爹。</p>
<p>——早！小鴨。</p>
<p>一天的清晨，在八斤子的門口，福根爹與小鴨碰面了。</p>
<p>——昨天夜里你聽見嗎？啊！我嚇死了！</p>
<p>——哪里沒有聽見？恐怕城里早已打進了呢！</p>
<p>黃色的陽光，爬到他們的臉上，充分地流露出他倆底恐惶。</p>
<p>這時，人都從各方廣集攏來，漸漸地多起來了。依舊像昨天一樣，你一句他一句，七中級八舌地在漫談著昨夜恐懼的情況。</p>
<p>——以前的我們不必談了，如今最要緊的得派人走進城去打聽信息。</p>
<p>福根爹氛忿地說。</p>
<p>小鴨勇敢地站出來。</p>
<p>福根爹！就是我去。</p>
<p>——你去？……我們實在也沒有人，那末你去，千萬要小心。</p>
<p>小鴨邁步就走，一點也沒有留戀。眾人的目光也都遙遙地遠送著他，直到他的背影給高粱幹子遮去為止。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>時光是溜得很快的，……太陽都下山了還不見小鴨的影子，於是眾人開始恐慌起來。</p>
<p>——唉！到這個時候他還沒有來！</p>
<p>福根爹急得似熱鍋上的螞蟻，反背著手在群眾前踱來踱去。大家沒有聲音，默默地遙望著遠遠的田際。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>隆隆的砲聲，依然透過重疊的房屋，廣闊的田野，不停地送過來，有時還夾雜著幾陣拍拍的機槍聲。在八斤子的門口閃著星星的火光，從半滅的火光裡，可以看見一羣黑蜮蜮的人頭。</p>
<p>——福根爹！你看麥地那邊一閃一閃的是什麼東西？</p>
<p>果然麥田那邊的黑影漸漸地近了，直到燈籠的微光能夠照到的時候，才認出是大家伸長著脖子所盼望的小鴨。</p>
<p>——小鴨！</p>
<p>——怎麼樣？</p>
<p>——城里有沒有失掉？</p>
<p>人都哄了上去，把小鴨包得密不通風。</p>
<p>——城是昨天夜里失掉的……。</p>
<p>小鴨跑得氣噓噓地，一面說一面在抹額上的汗。</p>
<p>——差一點性命都不保，虧得榮生在那里。</p>
<p>——小癟三榮生怎樣？</p>
<p>——福根爹！說得輕一點，以後我們不可再呌他小癟三了！</p>
<p>提到榮生，眾人眼前恍惚現出那個平時專門搶刦東西的地痞。</p>
<p>——為什麼？</p>
<p>——現在他闊綽了。今天早晨我進城的時候，給鬼子瞧見了，他說我是什麼「油煎豆」。虧得榮生，他坐在鬼子旁邊，不知說些什麼，他們給我放出來了。……後來在城里聽人家說：因為榮生領鬼子進城，所以請他做什麼會長。他說得口沫亂飛，覺得很榮幸似地。</p>
<p>——誰稀罕他！這個漢奸，流氓會長！他放得掉你，可放不掉大家呀。</p>
<p>——……</p>
<p>小鴨縮緊了頭頸，真像只被抽的鴨子，說不出話來了。</p>
<p>——我早已知道他一定會這樣幹的，看他無法無天到那樣地步？</p>
<p>——這短命癟三倒……大家下意識說著。</p>
<p>可是有一部分人終於想到了自己底村子，不自覺的打到寒噤：</p>
<p>——榮生做了官，我們的村子會會……</p>
<p>年老的福根爹，非常惶惑。他卻無法給眾人出了個主意</p>
<p>——喂：明天我們上城去，請他在鬼子前說一聲，不要下鄉來騷擾，好嗎？</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>明天有人從城里帶來消息說：新任xx會長，給什麼「油煎豆」槍斃了。</p>
<h3>七峯遺編（下）</h3>
<p>— 勻君</p>
<p>——民族小說話</p>
<p>書中也曾指出當時抗戰失敗的諸因素，如官軍將領的毫無鬥志，擁兵自衛，一經失敗，便慌亂逃走，第四回的鄭總兵，第八回的胡來貢便是這一類的典型人物。甚至於仗養兵名義，虛張聲勢，專以搜刮錢糧，打刦民財為事，如二十，二十一，二十三諸回所記。而民軍方面除了嚴栻部下以外，大都是乘亂時借兵報仇，以致紀律毫無，甚至互相殘殺，（四十回至四十三回所記）；一遇戰事反而按兵不動，或紛紛散去，如胡龍光無心守城，坐視清兵攻城而一矢不發（二十八回），時子求部下，一聞城陷消息便全部星散（三十一回）。而主其事者或書生談兵，毫無準備，如金鑌援救江陰，事先既無聯絡，戰時又無計劃（十八回）；或乘機擁兵，並無國族認識，如二十六回所記時子求，四十二回所記之凌四。而當時官吏，縉紳又不惜　顏降敵，為虎作倀，如錢謙益，蕭世恩、馬縣丞之流，都先後為敵所用；即守土有責者，如曹元芳等在城陷之前便隻身先逃，民眾方面除茍全性命以外，對於國族安危也毫不關心。而最可痛心的是民軍中竟有甘心為敵作嚮導的漢奸趙伯韜，蓋亦當時的王八妹，徐鴻發之類。這些雖是歷史上的陳跡，但沉痛的教訓也會使生在二百餘年後的我們感憤的！</p>
<p>全書似嚴栻起鄉兵為主幹，但因人物眾多，頭緒紛繁，把把主要人物的地位削減了許多，記嚴氏的事僅不過五六回，寫他用兵的前後又只有兩次，顯然是失掉全書的統一性。又如閻典史的抗戰，和江陰全城人民的壯烈犧牲，都是極好的題材，作者全沒有好好地運用，祇有輕描淡寫的幾句敷衍過去，反而努力去寫鄉間人民的私鬥和死中逃生的故事，佔了全書四分之一（如二十二，二十八，三十，三十四至三十六，三十八，四十至四十三，五十，五十一，五十三，五十四，共十五回）不免輕重倒置了。作者是目睹清兵屠殺的，對於鄉兵起義按理應有一點好感纔對，然而他並不，反認為多事，如二十二回敘陳孟立遇事敢言謂：「常熟彈丸之地耳，清朝勢大，只宜著人到彼講和，觀其動靜。若遽起兵，是運螳臂當車也。」而三十七回作者本人也居然站出來說：「俱是竹槍木棍，白布裹頭。要與清朝廝殺，真螳臂當車也。」這和現在的「惟武器論」者真是一鼻孔出氣了。作者是明人，對於明之亡國，也應有故國禾黍之思，如五十五回記改滿裝的文字，至少要有一點感慨之類，可是除了「而風俗亦一大變更矣」，什麼也沒說。而最後又頌揚著異族的統治者及其功狗；「自此揚總兵之威名日盛，海上兵（指明義陽王兵）莫敢犯境，百姓重享太平之矣。」幾個月前瘋狂的大屠殺，被作者完全忘掉了！像七峯樵道人這樣茍安健忘的人，在現在未必很少，也許會拉他去認為二百多年前的知己吧。要避免這惡影響，是決定於讀者的分寸的，這書在同一叢書內，其價值要次於「痛史」好幾倍。</p>
<h3>請你—</h3>
<p>— 林之光</p>
<p>請你給我帶來那枝槍，伙伴！</p>
<p>這槍枝，這刺刀曾伴我黃昏。</p>
<p>再剎那，我就要和它離開，</p>
<p>讓我撫摸它一回吧，一回！</p>
<p>請你為我寫一封家信，</p>
<p>告訴我那年老的母親：</p>
<p>敵人的槍彈打中我胸膛，</p>
<p>請她不要為我悲傷，悲傷。</p>
<p>再請你為我唱一首歌，</p>
<p>像我們在出發前唱過：</p>
<p>跨過先烈的尸體前進，</p>
<p>踏著先列的鮮血前進！</p>
<p>請你不要再記起我，</p>
<p>記著一個死人，無用！</p>
<p>請你記住敵人的殘暴，</p>
<p>天大仇恨，在戰場上報！</p>
<p>現在我是在笑了，</p>
<p>你看，我是在笑呀！</p>

<h3>平劇「四大名旦」之比較（上）</h3>
<p>— 雪鴻齋主</p>
<p>平劇演員素來分為「生旦淨丑」四行，因為過去生行的人才濟濟，而且常以主角身份演出，所以無形中已造成了她的超然地位。但民國以來，生行已漸見衰落，前輩都已老的老，死的死，而後輩繼起的很少很少，加之旦行中的梅蘭芳的一鳴驚人，程現秋荀慧生尚小雲徐碧雲朱琴心輩的相繼而出，雖然名稱上依舊「生旦淨丑」的那樣稱呼著，但事實上旦行的地位已遠在生行之上了，其中尤以梅蘭芳程硯秋荀慧生尚小雲四人的造詣之深，造成了梨園界「四大名旦」的榮銜，至於他四人的藝術，究竟如何，各界早有定評，現在就筆者個人的見解，加以評論，是否之處，尚希諸戲劇專家予以指正焉。</p>

<p>過去有「伶界大王」的尊稱，遊美後更加上了一個「文學博士」的榮銜，這天之驕子，足以在戰劇界裏自豪了。論他的藝術呢，的確有許多獨到之處，加之天賦本錢之足，當然給予了他不少的幫助。現在就他的唱做各方面加以觀察：他的嗓音屬宮，寬亮甜潤，聽來非常悅耳，加之說唸清脆，京白流利，無怪他那樣吃香了。至於做工，落落大方，毫無拖泥帶水之弊，而且扮相娟秀，表情細膩，到處能體會劇情，一舉一動，都能恰到好處，榮據旦行盟主，當然不是一件偶然的事情哪！</p>
<p>程硯秋</p>
<p>嗓子唱戲人的本錢，硯秋就吃虧在這本錢上，但是聰敏人自有聰敏人的辦法，他竟丟過了沒有嗓子的死唱，而去往腔上用功夫，結果，就在這「程腔」上大大吃香，可見天下的事情全在人為的了。硯秋的嗓屬商，唱時高若猿啼，細如遊絲，凄楚動人，加之他的拌相清麗，做派端正，最合乎做悲旦的條件，而且他的台步，非常穩鍊，據說走的是丁字步，所以雙雙金蓮，從不會露出裙外，這種絕技，恐怕不是一般俗伶所能注意到的吧。此外他的跑園場的漂亮，水袖工夫及屁股墊子工夫的深，都不是他人所能及的，所以能與蘭芳相匹敵的，硯秋一人而已。</p>
<h3>銀壇近聞錄</h3>
<p>— （秋雯）</p>
<p>二十世紀公司在一九三九年新片程序中，已決定攝制一部全用兒童演出的五彩歷史片，劇本係採用法王路易十三的偉蹟。片名為「紅貂」。Minium　Mink公司方面已籌備用全力攝制，而參加今年秋季在巴黎舉行的國際電影展覽會，但童星秀蘭鄧波兒，在該片中並不參加。</p>
<p>德國與登堡影業公司在一九三六年因攝制反法西斯蒂影片，遭希特勒下令停閉後，去年春間即重行復業，攝制武俠片「紅騎士」。因賣座特盛，自一集攝至五集，十月中盈餘達五百萬馬克。最近遂又被德政府收為國有。現正從事攝制「鐵漢之子」，該片完成後將作為一年一度的同盟國（自然是意大利和日本）的國際宣傳交換品。</p>
<p>俄國托爾斯泰之遺作「侏儒」已被英國高蒙公司採為劇本，益徵得蘇聯政府之同意將赴俄實地攝制，一部分演員擬徵用俄籍電影演員。藉以號召，屆時將由蘇聯人民委員會予以切實援助。英俄電影業的握手，這還是破天荒的創例。</p>
<p>派拉蒙，環球，聯美三家聯合在西班牙攝制的戰事新聞片「馬德里與西班牙」。自開始攝制至今，已完成十二萬呎，在英美公映已達七月之久。最近決將該項新聞片加以修剪整理後，分上下二集，在今年春季可以運往遠東各國公映。三月間可由中國至印度等地。</p>
<p>去年十一月初旬美總統羅斯福在其總統府私邸召宴全國電影公司製片人，羅在這次宴席上向各製片人演說，希望在下年度起每家公司要多量攝制科學影片，以作學生的課外讀物，所有劇本，由教育部搜集後義務供給云。</p>
<h3>記「貂蟬」歌詠會</h3>
<p>— 辛人</p>
<p>許多文人與藝人們，前晚在貂蟬茶室集合歡宴，演出了一番盛大的歌詠會。這天係由範松風，盧一方兩君作東邀集。同時，也就是給坤旦周梅艷小姐廣為文友們介紹見面的歡宴會。</p>
<p>當晚盛宴宏開，裙屐紛臨，佳賓濟濟一堂，不下六十餘位。文藝界如丁慕琴，張肖傖，吳觀蠡，周鍊霞，何煮石，陳靈犀……等，胥屬一時俊流。女客：古寒，譚金霖姊妹，翁鴻聲玉瑛姊妹，劉琴心，王雪艷，潘雪琴，朱鈞培等，大都是歌壇上的名藝人。</p>
<p>席上觥籌交錯，春生一室，笑語如珠。老伶工尤雲卿吹起了聲韻悠揚的笛子，首由主人範松風君唱了一闋「琵琶記」的賞著。往時他在「暨大」掌教，會主崑劇學講席甚久；名家法曲，不同凡響，合座盡為擊節，名崑票葉養吾君，續歌「鬧學」一段，亦很不錯。平劇由名評劇家張肖傖君高歌「罵曹」原板四句，字正腔圓，極富譚味。劉琴心小姐的大段「別姬」，慕擬畹華，殊見工力。次及名崑曲家顧傳玠，張傅芳兩君，彼此交互擫笛，分唱「琵琶記」「思凡」一闋，並極珠聯璧合之妙。周梅艷小姐和範松風唐雲裳先後合唱「小宴」「別窰」各一折，京崑俱佳，的是美才。餘如唐雲裳君啟麒派作風，連唱帶做的「追韓信」，名票王雪塵君氣度雍容的「南天門」等等，亦復各有千秋，都曾博得不少熱烈的掌聲。</p>
<p>這次參加盛會的士女們，當時各備禮品一件，攜往致贈梅艷小姐，用示獎掖，兼助雅興。一時羅列滿案，各式俱備，美不勝收。周鍊霞女士特為繪制松梅圖鏡架，上題「自與蒼松作一家，玉爐香裏影橫斜，胭脂試染憐才筆，細寫東風第一花。」短句，詩書畫三藝兼長，更屬嚴見生色。</p>
<p>歌詠會這場面真夠熱鬧。</p>
<h3>王雪艷　周鍊霞</h3>

<h3>夏佩珍中止返滬</h3>
<p>— 睦睦</p>
<p>北平三家戲院在爭聘中</p>
<p>夏佩珍搭著「奎德社」話劇班，在天津北洋戲院出演，據說成績不大好，而夏佩珍也因為嬌軀孱弱，水土不服，向當局辭班，將買掉返滬，此事已誌十五日本報。昨據與夏佩珍接近之某君自天津返滬談及，說所謂水土不服等情都是假的，上座不佳是事實，起初好賣七八成賬，後來逐漸不振，最凄慘的一天，祗二十二張票，票價最高是七角，如何夠開銷呢？夏佩珍雖不是採取拆賬制而是按月取包銀的，但在這種情形之下，也有「難乎為繼」之嘆，祗好以水土不服及身體來推托而辭班了。同時北平有「慶樂」「三慶」「開明」三家戲院，聽到這個消息，認為夏佩珍從前隨著明星公司以北平來拍攝啼笑姻緣影片時，曾在北平某一個遊藝中串演過一次義務戲，魔力相當偉大，這一次聽說她要回上海，認為是機會不再，乃各自派員到天津向她接洽，約她在禹歷巳卯元旦登台演短期，天津下來，有充分時間可以休養，禹歷新年的賣座，是差不到那裏去的，何況又是短期性質呢。現正在分頭進行中，不知誰家「捷足先得」看將起來，夏佩珍暫時還不致重返上海呢。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（八〇）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>慈瑞泉受富英祖孫三輩打罵</p>
<p>扮演老師爺的，第一須將那種狗仗人勢（說句文話就是狐假虎威）欺壓鄉民的神情，摹仿得十分相像，纔能為是劇生色。王拴子一條細長的小辮子，在頭上盤成個圓圈兒，太陽穴貼了兩片頭痛膏藥，一件長袍半扣半掖，手掌心擺著一封鐵纖球兒滾來滾去，出場的時候，把頭兒揚得高高的，肚子挺得遠遠的，牌子皺著，嘴巴咧著，學著螃蟹的橫步，挪到台口，那副神情，誰瞧著都得樂個不住。何況此老又是文武丑兼全的角色，擺的拳架子固然邊式，就是背的那套大洪拳二洪拳同十八般兵刃的名稱，也是字字清晰，熟極而流。至於嗓門的脆而且亮，更是人所不及。</p>
<p>慈瑞泉的玩意，雖不很好，卻還算過得去，當年也同老譚配過戲，數年前富英在前外開明戲院演「打漁殺家」王幼卿為配桂英一角，那天不侫曾往一觀，茲瑞泉也快六十歲的人了，那時天氣很冷，當他扮教師爺被蕭恩連打罵，赤著上身的當兒，他就半真半假倚老賣老的向富英說道：「你們譚家爺們真把我姓慈的欺負透啦！從你爺爺起就揍我，這我都不惱，怎麼你對著我也稱起二大爺來啦！我同你們譚家越交，我的班輩倒越小啦」。他這句話還沒說完，接著就是桂英的板子打在屁股上頭，瑞泉又向幼卿道：「我的屁股是你爺爺打慣的，好，我去找王瑤卿算帳去」！（按幼卿承嗣瑤卿，瑤卿當為老譚配桂英一角）。</p>

<p>醫林逸話</p>
<h3>始終保持權威地位　其故何在？乃因：　從動物試難騐中證明　（此係廣吿）</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南著</p>
<h3>睾丸內分泌確能挽救早衰</h3>
<p>人類不能長生不老，這確是一件憾事。不過現在的學醫的進步一是千里，雖然對於不老長生術尙未硏究成熟，可是對於預防人類早衰的一法，已經有所發現了。</p>
<p>一切長生防衰劑中，最惹人注意的，便是梅倫博士所提倡的睾丸內分泌學爲最可信。梅倫博士先以白兎做實騐，白兎生至五年左右的時候，身體便要衰退，食慾減少，步行蹣跚，毛片稀脫，呈衰弱狀態。此時乃裝飾少壯動物睾丸提出其精質飼之，於是精神恢復而且活潑，食慾增加，毛色光澤而密，壯健亦重新表現，隨之達到重返靑春之目的了。</p>
<p>基其同樣道理，這種硏究呈迅速的發展，結果遂决定向猩猩，牛羊等睾丸中抽出大量的內分泌，並滲入礦植物等有益於人體的成分，製成PANticome（補體康）一藥。對治療早　具非常偉大的成績。</p>
<p>人體之所致早衰，完全因度　違反生理生活所致，如過度荒淫，如過度操勞，或染上手淫惡習，或遺精滑精所致。其症象，爲面色蒼白，精神萎頓，肌肉削瘦，時感頭重頭痛，心悸盜汗，失眠健忘等。</p>
<p>一個早衰的患者，若應用睾丸法內分泌劑「補體康」治之，固然能使患者吿痊，但倘不將生活導入常規，而仍荒淫自瀆，則依然無效。</p>
<p>「補體康」爲一種新陳代謝劑尤有益於年邁之人。久服之後，確有返老還童之功。至女子可服好用「補體康」。</p>
<p>上圖之白兎，本已毛片脫落，衰老不堪，經德國生理學家梅倫博士用睾丸內分泌飼之，於是精神活潑，食慾增進。其豐滿而光澤之毛片，一見足證其醫學之萬能也。</p>
<h3>遺精次數增密的險象</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>遺精雖說有害，但若次數不密，或僅一月有遺，雖不治亦無妨，萬一次數逐漸增密，則精血枯竭，新陳代謝的機能逐漸低落，結果，腦神經，性神經。及脊髓部分大受損傷，一切虛弱　象，隨之蜂起。</p>
<p>遺精次數增密之後，可速行局部冷水摩擦，服以法國「耐而斯遺精片」即可制止。而「耐而斯遺精片」尙有鎭靜大腦神經的功效，患失眠症服之頗有奇效。其藥力之週到，確爲同樣製劑所不及。萬一遺精已引起神經衰弱，及性機能障碍，與腰酸背痛等症。如每日服以動物睾丸精質製劑「補體康」頗有卓效，此外如電療，注射等亦係上述各症的有效療法，但其功效，反不若積極服以「補體康」爲宜。因「補體康」含有三種成分，確具補腦，補腎，補血的三大功能，故能得醫師的信任。推爲內分泌劑中的最佳者。</p>

<h3>患了白濁後的丈夫</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌</p>
<p>夫妻愛情往往爲白濁所破壞</p>
<p>已婚男女不可不速行治愈之</p>
<p>罹染白濁後，對於淋病發展，不可不具深切之注意。其故有兩，一爲確保本身之病的安全，二爲勿使妻子染到白濁。此兩條件，却有深刻的矛盾。因爲患了白濁如果沒有在短期內治愈，勢必轉入慢性，一入慢性，如依然得不到良好之治法，勢必須作長期之禁慾生活。而精神上不免萎頓係或過分興奮，但如已結婚者，往往因環境關，難於度其僧侶之禁慾生活。結果，妻子必然被其荼毒。</p>
<p>從各個醫學者的統計，知道花柳病的患者，以淋病爲最多，而患了花柳病以致絕嗣者，亦以淋病患者爲最多。此尤爲患了白濁後的丈夫所宜注意的。原來淋病治愈極爲不易，是若濫服市上三五天可以斷根，或者藥的成分依然極舊，而美其名稱爲新藥，所謂換湯不換藥者，指這一類的勾當耳。而結果不僅亳不獲效，而且淋菌由尿道的局部尿道粘膜上，深入內部組織，及血液　男子患了淋病，睾丸損壞，女子患了淋病卵巢旣行毀傷。因此男女的輸精管輸卵管，被毀而不能執行生育工作，而釀成夫婦之悲涼景况，要挽救此種痛苦，惟德國淋病學博士發明之「克淋儂」始能勝任，因「克淋儂」具有抗淋噬菌之作用，故其撲滅淋菌，係採用包圍方式，因之凡經服「克淋儂」治愈後之淋病，從無再發之例，此爲「克淋儂」治淋特具之功效。凡不論已結婚或未結婚之男子惟有服「克淋儂」始能毫末無憾也。</p>
<h3>患肺病者鑒！</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>肺病患者，忽起喀血症或痰中帶血，病人與其家族，必大爲驚愕，以爲命懸旦夕，實則危險雖多，然能使病人安靜，處之泰然，一方專心信賴醫師之診療與藥治，卽可化險爲夷。事實上肺病全賴處置之適當，及內服肺病特效藥「補肺拿爾」，則其結果必絕對良好</p>
<p>原來該劑係集合　於殺滅肺結核菌之主要成分製成。可根除一切肺癆病，促進食慾，旺盛全身新陳代謝機能，故用　傷風，百日咳，老年痰喘等，無不發揮偉效。</p>
<h3>胃病自療</h3>

<h3>膀胱炎何法可治？</h3>
<p>症狀之變動　淋病之炎症，最易由後尿道侵入內尿道口，而波及附近於膀胱粘膜，更進而侵入其餘之膀胱部分，因而遂發生膀胱炎。患者感到尿意頻數。放尿時疼痛而尿質　濁，身發高熱，食慾不振。全身違和。惟患純急性膀胱炎者，每隔一二小時，即排尿一次，甚至隔二三十分，卽小便一次者，故夜不安枕，而釀成失眠之患，痛苦不堪。此外恥骨上部與會陰亦感痛楚，尤其放苦散於尿道膀胱炎所經過這尿道肛門等部份。然膀胱炎之痛苦，並不止此。往往在小便之後，繼之以血滴，此血滴稱這爲終末性血液Terminale　　Haematurie，所以此症之療治，絕對不可行局部療法，如市上　　透臘　菌之三五天可愈之成藥，可得奏功，因此等膀胱炎範圍甚大，且淋菌已四散奔　，所以决難在一處可撲滅之。</p>
<p>特效之治療　對於膀胱炎之各種療法，經余多年來細心考索，知此症非用內服「克淋儂」，以振奮全身細胞，　產生一種抗淋毒素，以噬滅淋菌而　消炎，退腫，利尿等效。一方採用敏捷手術，而以德國靜電療法，及Ｘ線電療等，交相爲用，以發揮滅之威力。則急性淋時，二三星期可愈，慢性則五星期內，未有不完全功治者</p>
<p>診時上午十時至下午六時自卽日起每天送診二十號，每號僅取號金五角</p>

<h3>三毒</h3>
<p>— 彥公</p>
<p>有人說：「日本國旗所到之處，便緊隨着毒品的流行」。這所謂毒品，當然只就鴉片，嗎　，白面……等等而言。其實，掩蔽在太陽旗下的，那一處不是烟館林立，賭場　比，妓院遍設，可算得三毒齊　。</p>
<p>「烟館」「賭場」妓院三者代表着當地的繁榮，也是榨取財源最輕巧的辦法。而其實最大最高的成就，則是在毀滅一般人的民族意識，高尙志氣；與夫造成一般人的寡廉鮮恥的墮落觀念。充其極，可以使遍地魔鬼，遍地禽獸，那般自命的主子們，便將驅策役使，隨心所欲，再無一個人會反抗，再也無力反抗。計確是妙極！惡極！毒極！</p>
<p>爲了推行三毒政策，所謂僞政權者，也奉命唯謹，事實上且以此爲供養自己的不二法門。最近報載：「晉省文水縣公　訓令，　字第一號，令南賢村長副。爲訓令事，查城內賀家巷妓院，原爲維持良民而設，……頃奉皇軍　令，三日內務增加人數，事非得已，茲規定除由城關選送外，凡三百戶以上村莊，每村選送妓女一名，以年在二十歲左右，確無疾病，頗具姿色者爲標準，務於最　期內送縣，以憑騐收，所有待遇，每名每月由維持會供給麵粉五十斤，小米五升，煤油二斤，黑炭一百餘斤，並一人一次給洋一元，……事關急要，務須速辦，如有遲延，恐有未便，萬勿輕忽爲要，　　此令，知事宋育英」。這眞是空前絕妙的一紙訓令，也是僞政權下僞公署的不朽政績。</p>
<p>自然，不久的將來，僞政府還可創設若干公立的「烟館」「賭場」「妓院」，並訓令各村各鎮普遍推行，則「三毒」功成，魔鬼禽獸　皆大歡喜。</p>
<h3>舊郵票市塲</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>你如果在河南路這一條書店街上向南走去，經過了中華，商務這兩大書店，便會看見馬路旁邊許多舊郵票攤子，一個玻璃鏡框，裹面放着好多舊郵票，下面有若干郵票簿堆在地上。如果有顧客走去，擺郵票攤子的人，便會拿起郵票簿來，讓你揀選，等你揀中了，經過討　價還價，許是會成交的。</p>
<p>本來，在上海這都市裏面，擺郵票攤子的人，散處在各條馬路上面，並不集中，做這項生意的人也是不多。不知爲什麽，一八一三一的砲火，竟使這些擺郵票攤子的人集中到河南路上，人數也似乎加多了。大槪有許多失業的人，也以這項賣買舊郵票的生意，以維　時的生活。除了河南路之外，像靜安寺路，愛文義咱，霞飛路，也有幾家賣買舊郵票的商店，但多半由外人經營，而主顧當然也以碧眼黃　爲多了。</p>
<p>我們知道在歐美各國，歡喜收集舊郵票的人很多，就是國王和總統之中，也有好多有集郵之癖，　已過的英皇停喬治五世，最喜集郵，而現任美國總統羅斯福，在海德公園的寓所中，也集有不少郵票。此外不拘商學各界中，也有愛好集郵的。至於中國人，對於集郵一向不發生什麽興趣，可是近年來，在上海有好多人突然愛好收集郵票，這裹面更以靑年學生爲多，小學生也不少。結果集郵的人一多，賣買郵票的人也就日見加多起來。</p>
<p>就爲了集郵的人，以靑年學生爲多，所以郵票市塲集中在河南路吧，因爲多數的學生，常在河南路上進出，打商務，中華，或其他書店買了書籍文具回出來，順便在郵票攤子上看看，有中意的郵票，買幾個回去，貼在簿冊上面。有時我們可以看見有靑年學生或是小學生，拿了幾枚郵票，作爲樣子，在郵票攤上逐一巡行配取全套。不過在河南路上，所有可以見到的郵票，多半是普遍的，珍奇的不大有，售價每枚低者幾分，貴的幾角，幾元以上的不大有。想到海外的郵票市塲，珍奇的郵票，一枚要値千萬元，那眞可說好像小巫之遇大巫了。</p>
<p>郵票攤子旣這麽多，這許多舊郵票向那裹去收買得來？這也是一件使人發生興趣的事。據我所知道的，自有一班人，把信件上的郵票撕將下來，拿到這些攤子上去賣，這裹面，尤其是以洋行裏的西　，　歐爲多，因爲他們有機會到字紙麓裏去收集信封，把外國郵票逐一撕下去賣錢。擺郵票攤子的人，收買得來，經過一番整理，那一個値價，那一個不値錢，有同樣的更理成整套，貼在簿上，然後再以幾分或幾角一枚，幾元一套，售給顧客。整批進來，零個兒出去，祇要有人來買，當然可賺不少錢。祇是對於舊郵票的認識，也要相當的熟練，以免把珍奇的郵票，在不知不覺中以賤價出售了。</p>
<h3>淘舊書</h3>
<p>— 慈雲</p>
<p>八一三抗戰爆發後，書本子又遭了一個大「刦」，不但寳貴的文化遺產遭受到「親善」的恩惠，而且更可惜的是受到了火葬，其他整本巨冊也被東一本西一冊的星散開來，而因此失却了　原來的價値，這是多麽的可惜！因此假設懂一點古書的人，在舊書堆里也許可以偶然發現或多或少的珍本絕版，因而集　了一部或幾部的古書，那對於保存國粹的工作上，也盡了一點國民的義務，雖然國粹有質的優劣之分，但我們不能平白地讓人家私自的拿去撑門面。</p>
<p>砲火迷漫在這上海底天空，沿蘇州河底南邊，在盆湯弄橋和新閘路橋底馬路旁，東一堆西一堆的佈防了許許多多的舊書攤，舊貨担里裝滿了各種各樣的書籍，洋裝的，古裝的，紙裝的，書面子；十六開，三十二開，六十四開的大小；英文的，中文的，圖書的，文藝的，理論的，翻譯的各種類的內容，這些大多從各書店里偷出來的，所以價　還便宜。</p>
<p>近年來新興的舊書店和攤子開張了很多家，素以購買新書的文化街，自從抗戰開始後，書底銷路受了各種原因的影響，有幾家底書店不是縮小門面，也就　移內地求發展了，所以點綴在文化街上的，倒是新興的舊書攤代撑了塲面，有時期，文化街大有十步一攤之勢，近來大約爲了妨礙人行道而减少了，有幾家攤主集合了資本，合力經營半間或一間店面的書　了。</p>
<p>在卡德路愛文義路底四周，舊書攤散佈在馬路旁，這里自戰後就成了大中小學校的集中地，所以生意着實可以做一下，尤其在開學期間，各學校學生競相購買敎科書，自從敎科書因紙張昂貴而一律加三成之後，舊書攤上底敎科書大有不痙而走之勢。</p>
<p>淘舊書底人們底胃口，隨着一年年的變換了，抗戰後關於社會科學方面的書籍，銷路好得多了，這是應該有的好現象。年靑人對於求知的選擇，揀最迫切最有勁的一門而努力了。</p>
<p>有人願以七折的價格，購買一本「大衆政治經濟學」，一本封面撕破了的「政治經濟學講話」，討價八毛錢，還價不是生意經，像這些年靑人所流行愛讀的書籍，是不會便宜的。其他舊版子的「鐵流」「石炭王」，絕版的「士敏土」「鐵甲車」「毀滅」這些書，是照定價出售；一本魯迅譯　　卡而斯基著底「藝術論」，這本書據說當初是被査禁的，除了最近在「魯迅全集」中收羅之外，當初的單行本是不常見的有人以一毛幾分錢的代價買下來；一本恩格斯著底「私有財產及其國家之起源」，這本書要覓的人很多，可是市面上不容易發見。關於水　書店底書籍，在書堆里很容易發見，水　書店開在一九二九－三〇年之間，出版的書底　量方面是比較進步的。</p>
<p>有經營舊書　朋友，利用各報服務版底地位大做其不化錢底廣吿，登載他底書底目錄，這樣方便了淘書的人，免得浪費時間，並且可以打電話給他送來的，價格是差不多的，有了這樣的關係之後，他經常把書送上門來讓你選擇所愛的書本子，如果你委託他物色書籍，也可代爲效勞，這樣可以省力了</p>

<p>刺繡　刺繡者的主要出賣品，是用特製的綫與針刺繡出來的花樣，其次是針與綫那種特製的針，一端穿連着綫，一端又有一尖鈎，依照繪在布面上的花紋線條，順次穿過去，其有尖鈎的一端，因針被拔，就會發生勾帶作用，因此，布面上的綫可用針插下去，而同時又可由下面抽上來，相互交往而成花紋，據說大幅的中堂立軸都可刺繡；一天的收入也頗可觀。</p>
<p>剪花樣　這也是一種以婦女爲主顧的買賣。這種花樣大多是用於鞋頭，手帕，以及小兒之涎圍衣服上，它是用白紙剪成的各種花鳥圖案等，售價雖廉，但一天也有七八角之收入。技術純熟者剪此種花樣可不用印模，一把剪刀很輕捷地在白紙上扭幾扭就成功一張花樣，別出心裁者現在還有「航空救國」花樣出售。</p>
<p>此外，還有刻圖章，賣唱，吹糖泡等也都是在街頭以藝技換飯吃的玩意，不過，這些藝術不只限於街頭，故從略。失業的朋友！牢記着：　有一技之長，旣無　凍　。　的話罷，努力向前，去做一個失業狂潮中的幸運者罷！「完」</p>
<h3>六十年後上海灘</h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>新華影片公司出品　金城大戲院映</p>
<p>很久很久以前了，看過一張美國片「五十年後之新世界」（Just　　Imagine），那是和「六十年後上海灘」同樣的一張理想電影。故事已不能完全記憶了，彷彿說是五十年後的新世界，一切都發展到一個新的程度，如人類已經廢除姓名，稱爲No，A，或B……住宅都是數十層的高樓大夏，私人的小飛艇像現在的汽車一樣多，飲食已製成了丸片，……最後好像是到月球上去旅行，利用攝影技巧，把光怪陸離的新世界呈現在觀衆面前。</p>
<p>科學是在日新月異的進步，「五十年後之新世界」中的「設想」，有若干部份或許是可以做到的。不過因爲是趣味電影，不免隨劇作者的「設想」，又憑藉着優越的設備，攝製成了那樣一部獵奇性質的電影。</p>
<p>「六十年後上海灘」也有類似之處，如飛艇的來往自如，機械理髮，心理測騐器，甚至可以主宰大自然的風雨雷電。</p>
<p>中國攝影塲的一切設備，自然遠遜於好來塢的，所以，當然不能和「五十年後之新世界」相提並論。不過「六十年後上海灘」還是戰前攝竣的，否則連這樣較大的塲面都不可能了。</p>
<p>劇本的編製略嫌鬆懈，而韓　根和劉繼羣的怕老婆，是太落老調了。</p>
<p>總之，「六十年後上海灘」不過是張趣味電影罷了。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>

<p>第二回　林工師妙解標準化　金導員高談平等觀</p>
<p>金小姐道：「眞的有走錯房間的人嗎？」林建成道：「因爲他們每一層樓的裝置，是一樣的。從電梯裹踏出來，竟認不淸楚是第幾層樓。聽說有一位工人，是個單身漢，他住在五樓十四號。十四號離電梯很近，一拐灣便是。他那天放工以後，不知在那裹喝了一點酒回來。原想回到自己屋子裹去，不想電梯在四樓停的時候，他誤以爲到五樓了。踏出電梯，十四號的方向也是一樣，開進門去，裹面的陳設，也大同小異。他不管三七廿一，就在牀上一鑽，鼾聲大作。及至四樓十四號的主人回來，原來他們是一對新夫婦，到自己房中　看，却見臥榻之上，已有他人酣睡，大爲詫異。拉着他起來，他還糊裹糊塗，當了他的朋友夫婦來訪問他，說着囈語道：　請坐！請坐！你們從那裹好風吹來呀！　這豈不是太標準化的一個笑話嗎？」林建成的話，說得何家兩位小姐，笑不可仰。金小姐道：你的話兒，有一個漏洞。林建成問：什麽漏洞？金小姐道：「四樓十四號，和五樓的十四號，他們門上當然都有鎖，他們當然都是鎖了門出去。怎麽可以隨隨便便，推門進去呢？」林建成道：這不是我又多說一句話，那與標準化也有些關係。這房子是有四五百間，四五百間自然都有鎖，但鑰匙不能無相同者。四樓十四號與五樓十四號，鑰匙安知不相同呢？更有一說：現在的工人，道德都高尙了，不比從前。他們房門不鎖，也是常有　事。試觀他們，有住在大廣間的，許多人住在一處，如何鎖起門來呢？正說到　裹時，先　墓已經到了。老遠就望見　座白石的大牌坊，上面是「碧血丹心」四個綠字。從那個牌坊裹望進去，却見夾道兩傍都種着松柏，雖不甚高，已現出　葱的氣象。這　地方，在　爭的時候，曾經被人家一度　過飛機塲的。現在却有了一個小市集，那個小市集，便是靠着先烈墓而興旺起來的。因爲初到上海的人，往往都要到此地來瞻仰先烈墓，春秋往日，來此游玩的人尤其多。（一七）</p>

<h3>Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Telegram to the Nation: Hoping that Local Gentry and Elites Will Serve Their Hometowns to the Best of Their Abilities and Personally Lead the Way in Promoting Military Service and Developing the Economy</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the gentry, elites, and educators throughout the country on the 19th, hoping that they would serve their hometowns to the best of their abilities and personally lead the way in promoting military service and developing the local economy, to make up for the inadequacy of government decrees and to accelerate the completion of tasks. The original telegram is recorded below. All provincial governments, provincial party headquarters, municipal governments, and municipal party headquarters should forward it to the gentry, elites, and educators throughout the country for their consideration. The War of Resistance has entered its later stages. Success or failure, rise or fall, all depend on whether we can promote national integrity to strengthen the power of a protracted war. In particular, it depends on people of high reputation in counties, districts, townships, and villages throughout the country to bravely take on the responsibility for the fate of the nation. For thousands of years, our country</p>
<p>Has taken loyalty and filial piety as the foundation of the nation.</p>
<p>Cultivating oneself and benefiting the world is seen as the basis. It is known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. Those who conform to this are admired by the world, and those who violate it are despised by the nation. This is indeed what our ancestors and sages painstakingly promoted to form a social atmosphere, especially unifying the will of the nation as a whole to strive for survival. Books and famous theories expound on the morality of our nation, especially highlighting loyalty and filial piety. Today, when we are in a period of life-and-death struggle with violent enemies, everyone must vow to be loyal to the country and do their best to be loyal to the nation in order to revive our country and protect our nation. As the saying goes, "When the wind blows, the grass bends." From ancient times,</p>
<p>The success of implementation relies on the strength of the masses,</p>
<p>And the responsibility of promotion lies with local heroes and outstanding people. If we do not rise up in time today, personally practice and do our best for our hometowns, and exhaust our responsibility to defend the country and the nation, and preserve the heritage and undertakings painstakingly created by our ancestors, then we will inevitably sit idly by as our descendants are slaughtered and enslaved. Without loyalty or filial piety, we will not only have no face to face our ancestors, but we will also be despised by the people of the world.</p>
<p>Master or slave, honor or disgrace, is a matter of a moment.</p>
<p>This is what all our compatriots, especially the wise men in various places, should deeply and thoroughly reflect on. The Japanese pirates have invaded our country and committed atrocities to the extreme. From the four northeastern provinces to North China and Southeast China, wherever the Japanese pirates' blades reach, they slaughter, rape, burn, and plunder property, implement poison gas, and destroy production. Tracing their obvious evil intentions, they not only want to destroy our country, but they also want to eliminate our race. Fortunately, since the War of Resistance, relying on the military and civilians throughout the country, we have deeply understood the great meaning of loyalty and filial piety and vowed to fight to the death with the violent enemy. Some are racing to carry guns, fighting with flesh and blood on the front line, or donating wealth and destroying their homes without hesitation, or exhausting their labor and braving dangers to engage in increasing production and saving the destruction during the war.</p>
<p>Fighting for nineteen months,</p>
<p>Although the enemy's invasion is deep, the more deeply they fall into the quagmire, the more difficult it is for them to advance or retreat. The enemy country's international situation is deteriorating day by day, and domestic measures are exhausted. The whole country is in panic, filled with the terror of impending doom. All the changes will not be beyond our expectations. The final goal is getting closer and closer to us. On the other hand, it is precisely because the enemy knows that it is on the verge of danger that it will inevitably try its best to make a final attempt. If the compatriots throughout the country relax even a little at this time, then not only will all previous efforts be in vain, but the tragedy of defeat and destruction will be imminent. If we can</p>
<p>Clearly see the difficulties and increase our efforts,</p>
<p>Relying on our vast land and population, we can strive to replenish human and material resources, and the great task of overcoming the enemy and completing the national rejuvenation can also be achieved soon. This is truly the time for all of us, from top to bottom, including local sages, to serve our country in time, and it is also the fate of our country for thousands of years to come. Regarding ways to replenish human and material resources and strengthen the power of the War of Resistance, the central and local governments should step up their efforts to organize and promote them rapidly. I, Generalissimo, hope that the virtuous gentry, elites, and educators in various places will serve their hometowns to the best of their abilities, personally lead the way, to make up for the inadequacy of government decrees and to accelerate the completion of tasks. The main points are as follows: (Telegraph on the 19th) (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Fierce Fighting Between Two Armies in the Conghua and Huaxian Areas; Chinese Troops Near Taipingchang; Japanese Troops Reinforce with Four Divisions from the South</h3>
<p>Chinese Troops Determined to Defend Zhaoqing</p>

<p>(Chongqing) Observers of the Sino-Japanese War are now paying close attention to the development in the northwest and southwest. Although the Japanese army is currently on the offensive on the Beijiang front in Guangdong Province, well-informed Chinese sources still believe that the current Japanese offensive is only intended to consolidate the Japanese army's defenses in Guangzhou and then to attack Guangxi Province. The Chinese military authorities here have repeatedly received information that Japanese reinforcements have arrived in Guangdong Province. At the same time, Chinese people from all walks of life believe that the Japanese army's current attacks on several crossings of the Yellow River are intended to cross the river and invade Shaanxi. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Sihui: More than 1,000 Japanese troops attacked Chibaini on the 16th and were intercepted by Chinese troops. On the 17th, they fled to Xinjie.

(Dispatch on the 19th) A Chinese military spokesman announced today that the Japanese army has now resumed its offensive in Guangdong Province, especially with the most frequent movements in the Xijiang area. Military sources believe that the Japanese army will attack Zhaoqing, 70 kilometers west of Guangzhou, as the city is the most important military stronghold in western Guangdong. If the Japanese army occupies the city, it can launch an offensive towards Guangxi. The Chinese supreme commander attaches great importance to the status of Zhaoqing and has dispatched elite troops and taken various precautionary measures. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) The war in Guangdong Province is currently focused on the Beijiang and Xijiang areas. The Japanese army in Beijiang is currently advancing in three routes: one from the northeast of Huaxian, aiming at Fogang, one advancing north along the Yuehan Road, attempting to attack Bajiangkou, and the other heading northwest from Yinzhan'ao along the highway, with the intention of spying on Qingyuan. The Japanese army in the Xijiang area is currently concentrating its main force in Jiujiang, attempting to cross the river from here to attack Heshan and Gaoming, and then advance in a roundabout way to attack Zhaoqing and Wuzhou from the side, in order to fulfill its dream of invading Guangxi Province. Another Japanese column is currently attacking Lubao, northwest of Sanshui, with the intention of spying on Sihui from here. At present, the situation in Yangjiang Dianbai and Beihai in the south is also very tense. Japanese planes have been constantly flying over Dianbai and Beihai counties to reconnoiter and drop bombs, which also has a special purpose. It is expected that a major battle in South China will begin within days. (Express News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Notes of the United States, Britain, and France to Japan</h3>
<p>On December 31st, the United States presented a note to Japan regarding the overall situation in the Far East; on January 14th, Britain followed suit; and on the 17th, France followed suit again; their voices echoed each other, and their momentum was like a string of pearls. It has long been rumored that the world's democratic powers will take parallel diplomatic actions against the aggressor in the Far East, and it is only now that it has begun. Looking at the notes of the three countries, the wording is different, but their meanings are all the same; there are five main points: 1. Their rights and interests have been greatly infringed, and they can no longer tolerate this; 2. The promises that Japan has made in the past have lost all credibility; 3. The so-called new order is exposed as merely a pretext for closing the door; 4. The state of affairs changed by force cannot be regarded as valid; 5. The Nine-Power Treaty and other international treaties cannot be unilaterally abandoned and must still be respected. The tone is firm, and the meaning is serious, which is rarely seen in international documents; considering that for several years, countries have pretended to be deaf and dumb, and have responded to each other with superficial diplomatic rhetoric, it is indeed a step forward.</p>
<p>How Japan will respond to the notes of the three countries is still unknown. According to what has been revealed by their opinion leaders, the Japanese government will use three conditions as the basis for negotiations with Britain and the United States: 1. Complete liberation of the Eastern countries, including the elimination of China's colonial status and the freedom of Eastern people to travel and reside; 2. Complete freedom of trade in the world, including the cancellation of existing economic groups, the abolition of tariff barriers, and import quotas; 3. Fair redistribution of raw materials, including the freedom to purchase raw materials that are indispensable for national survival and the protection of natural resources necessary for national defense. It is said that only in this way can all disputes be naturally resolved. Is this what the Japanese authorities think, using propaganda as a probe, as a prelude to negotiations? No. Why? Japan is the culprit of aggression, definitely not the protector of the weak and small. Judging from the path of their thoughts and actions, there is absolutely no such conclusion in logic. Furthermore, it is said that Japan, because of its failure to invade China, will also automatically give up its control over Korea, Taiwan, and the Pacific mandated islands; this is also something that cannot be believed in terms of common sense and reason. Even if we analyze the meaning of the freedom mentioned in their first and second items and the dominance mentioned in the third item, it is easy to find their contradiction and prove their insincerity. Some say that when things are exhausted, they change, and when they change, they become unblocked; how can we know that Japan is not suddenly changing its plans? Some say that if you lay down the butcher's knife, you can become a Buddha on the spot; how can we know that Japan is not suddenly awakening? This must be a politician with great wisdom and insight to be able to have such a grand vision; Japan has intellectuals with wisdom, so there is this saying; Japan has no politicians with wisdom, so there is no such thing. Otherwise, after launching a military invasion since September 18th, it can be proved everywhere that their actions are wrong, and there are opportunities to rein in the horse and pull back from the precipice at any time; this is also the case after July 7th and August 13th; however, they are stubborn and have fallen into a stalemate where they cannot stop. This is固以以 the fact that there is no one politician in their country who has the benevolence and courage to reverse the situation. Moreover, giving up aggression and tying it to conditions that are not related to each other at all, can this be regarded as a sudden awakening or a change of plans? Playing with the tricks of counter-attack propaganda, still regarding answering back as a gain, then we know that the normal path implied by the three countries is still something that Japanese politicians cannot make good use of!</p>
<p>In fact, it is originally a luxury to suddenly expect a change in the Far Eastern situation due to the notes of the three countries. The talks by US Secretary of State Hull yesterday and the day before, as well as the commentary in the London Times and the telegram from its Tokyo reporter, can be said to have seen through its hidden meanings. What we cannot let go of is: since the countries deeply regret that Japan has only used empty words to perfunctory, and they also clearly know that the Japanese authorities can also understand that empty words are not enough to solve the problem; however, they still do not thoroughly confirm that empty words are the inevitable response to empty protests, and they do not vigorously implement effective methods other than empty words; this is extremely uneconomical from any point of view. Some believe that the countries have separately protested to Japan, then separately provided aid to China, and then taken parallel diplomatic actions against Japan. Each stage has taken a considerable amount of time; then, from the beginning of parallel diplomatic actions to effective practical methods, there must also be a distance of time. This is indeed true. Therefore, we can imagine Japan's response to the notes of the three countries: to fully utilize its diplomatic time and strive to expand its space for aggression. In China, it will carry out its military actions to show its strength in occupying and destroying; it will carry out its political actions to exhaust its skills in dividing and anesthetizing; it will carry out economic actions to satisfy its desires for plundering and exploitation. Internationally, it will use international contradictions, contradictions between regions, races, political parties, classes, and agriculture and industry within countries, and contradictions within the news industry in various aspects of diplomacy, propaganda, and social movements to carry out its tricks of threats and enticements, and sowing discord to disperse the power of international parallel actions. Didn't we hear yesterday that there is a secret organization in Japan called the Ziyun Society, which published advertisements in newspapers to threaten US President Roosevelt; knowing that President Roosevelt will never be intimidated by threats, yet they still do it, which also shows that Japan in the near future will definitely do everything possible.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Fiercely Attack Jingshan; Many Killed by Chinese Troops; Some Japanese Troops Once Rushed into the City; Chinese Reinforcements Arrive and Counterattack; Sanyangdian Has Been Recaptured by Chinese Troops</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) The Japanese troops who attacked Jingshan on the morning of the 16th were met by Chinese troops in a counterattack. After six hours of fierce fighting, many were wiped out. Later, more than a thousand Japanese reinforcements arrived from Jierling, Qujiachang, and Laohushan. Chinese troops then firmly defended the city walls and fought fiercely with Japanese troops on the high ground north of the city. Chinese reinforcements continued to arrive, and morale was boosted. Also, a unit of more than two hundred Japanese troops with three artillery pieces sneaked to the southeast of Xisunqiao, Jingshan, on the 16th and 17th. Another unit sneaked to the northwest of Jingshan and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops. The Japanese troops in Sanyangdian were counterattacked by Chinese troops on the evening of the 16th, suffering heavy casualties.

At dawn on the 15th, Japanese troops destroyed the north gate of Sanyangdian, but by evening, Chinese troops were still defending the city. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Yichang) The Japanese troops in central Hubei have been fiercely attacking Jingshan in several routes for days. Chinese officers and soldiers are fighting bloody battles, vowing not to retreat. The two sides have been fighting back and forth, vying for control several times, and street fighting has occurred. The Chinese defenders have suffered heavy casualties under the intense Japanese artillery fire. On the 18th, a unit of Japanese troops rushed into the city. Chinese reinforcements have now arrived to counterattack. The Japanese troops have also increased to more than 2,000 men, with seven or eight artillery pieces. The Japanese troops who collapsed from Sunqiao on the 17th joined forces to attack the Chinese side. Also, more than 2,000 Japanese troops in front of Zaoshi are also advancing towards Jingshan, including a unit of more than 400 men, with two artillery pieces, who have bypassed to the rear of Sunqiao and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese troops.

<h3>Guerrilla Forces in North China are Very Active; the Japanese Side Has Also Acknowledged This</h3>

<h3>The Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is Approaching; Party and Government Officials Arrive in Chongqing One After Another; The Agenda of the Conference Will Be Announced After the Opening; The Government Held Meetings to Exchange Views</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Although the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee is about to open, the time and place of the meeting are kept strictly secret. Special badges have been issued to the representatives attending the meeting and the staff of the venue. Leaders from the party, government, and military circles from all over the country are arriving in Chongqing daily, which is the only symbol that the session date of January 20 is approaching. It is believed that the resolutions of the conference will follow the precedent of the Kuomintang's temporary conference held in Hankou last April and will be announced only after the closing of the session. The authorities strictly keep all important meetings secret. This is a temporary measure to ensure the safety of national leaders and prevent Japanese air raids. It is reported that the government held an important meeting yesterday to exchange views on the proposals for the conference. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Spokesman of the Ministry of Finance Talks About the Issue of Interest Payments on Foreign Debt; People in London Expressed Welcome; Prices of Public Bonds Rose by One Pound</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a spokesman for the Chinese Ministry of Finance, the temporary suspension of interest payments on foreign debt by China is not a deferment of payment. As soon as China regains control of the customs revenue in the Japanese-occupied areas, it will immediately prepare to resume interest payments on foreign debt. The total amount of foreign debt owed by China is 2.5 billion yuan, and the monthly interest required is only 18 million yuan. If it were in peacetime, there would be no problem in paying this interest. Last year, the average monthly revenue of the customs was still 20 million yuan, four-fifths of which would be enough to pay the interest on foreign debt. But now, four-fifths of the ports are occupied by the Japanese army, so the Chinese government has to instruct the Central Bank to use the customs revenue from the ports still under Chinese rule to pay part of the interest on foreign debt. (Haitong Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The remarks made yesterday by the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Finance regarding public bonds secured by customs duties were welcomed by people in London today. The prices of Chinese public bonds all rose by one pound and there was a slight demand. Chinese people from all walks of life believe that the announcement that China cannot continue to pay is partly intended to draw the world's attention to the fact that China is still trying to raise funds separately to pay off debts even though it is engaged in the war of resistance against Japan. People here generally believe that the remarks of the spokesman of the Chinese Ministry of Finance are an indication that the Chinese government is now making efforts to seek a satisfactory solution.

<p>(Chongqing) Leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang are currently seeking closer political cooperation to consolidate the nation's united front. Regarding this matter, Zhou Enlai, the sole Communist Party official in the National Government, made a statement to an Associated Press reporter, stating that the current war of resistance has made the cooperation between the two parties closer. Although party members of the two parties may have different political views, their ultimate goal is the same: to fight in the united front and build a new China. To achieve this goal, the Communist Party wants to make two suggestions: First, it requests that the Kuomintang allow Communist Party members to join Kuomintang youth groups and other organizations. The Communist Party will submit a list of those who join to the Kuomintang authorities, and will prohibit Communist Party members from enticing Kuomintang members. Second, a joint committee should be organized between the two parties to promote cooperation between the two parties. These proposals will be submitted at the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee meeting to be held in the middle of this month. If the first point cannot be accepted, then the second point should be acceptable. Zhou believes that there is no major conflict between the Chinese Communist Party and capitalism. He said, "The most important land and capital issues have already been handled by the government, which may greatly satisfy Communist Party members. The method of handling it is not confiscation, but rather disposal in a legal manner. If disputes arise between landlords and tenants, the government will come forward to arbitrate and adjudicate. Therefore, before the Xi'an Incident, some land in northern Shanxi was confiscated, but it was immediately returned. Almost all large enterprises during the war are managed by the government. This experience can prevent major social and economic problems from occurring in China when it becomes a truly democratic country in the future. China's nationalization of major enterprises and undertakings is sufficient to avoid the social problems encountered by the United States, Belgium, and France." Regarding the point that Britain and the United States are unwilling to assist China because they fear China becoming communist, Zhou Enlai said, "The Soviet Union has no political ambitions towards China. If Britain and the United States assist China to protect the rights and interests of the South and Northeast, and the Soviet Union continues to help China in the Northwest, then China will surely win." If Britain and the United States abandon their aid to China, then we will definitely ask the Soviet Union to give us more assistance. Although the Soviet Union has given us the greatest assistance, we currently have two difficulties: First, to make Britain and the United States understand that the Soviet Union has no ambition to interfere in China's internal affairs, and its purpose is only to protect itself and prevent Japanese aggression. Second, maintaining Sino-Soviet transportation is quite difficult." Zhou said that arming farmers to continue the war of resistance will not lead to civil strife after the war of resistance is completed. He said, "Chinese farmers will not use their arms to confront the government, because in addition to implementing military education, we also implement political training. In the future, we will pay attention to land tenure, exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies, and usury problems, so that all difficulties between the government and the people can be permanently avoided."

<h3>League of Nations Appoints Subcommittee to Discuss Chinese Proposal; Gu Weijun Also Appeals to the United States, Hoping for Powerful Action Outside the League</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations held a secret meeting at 3:00 PM today. Gu Weijun, the chief Chinese representative and Ambassador to France, immediately submitted a draft resolution, the content of which included the various suggestions already listed in yesterday's speech. The most important of these include: (1) Member states of the League of Nations should provide financial and economic assistance to China; (2) Imports of Japanese goods should be prohibited; (3) The transport of aviation kerosene to Japan should be prohibited; (4) The Chinese government should be provided with all kinds of conveniences in the transportation of arms purchased from foreign countries; (5) The Council of the League of Nations should appoint an adjustment committee to handle everything, composed of representatives of countries with special relevance to the Far East issue. The Council has submitted this draft resolution for discussion, but has not made any decision, only appointing representatives from China, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, Yugoslavia, and Latvia to form a subcommittee to discuss it from a technical point of view and report to the Council tomorrow. According to well-informed sources, the Council may reject the various suggestions put forward by the Chinese representative and instead pass a resolution stating the League's connection with China, and reaffirming the resolutions previously passed in stronger terms, namely that member states should individually assist China, and that all actions sufficient to weaken China's resistance to aggression should be avoided. Some quarters here believe that the resolution put forward by Ambassador Gu Weijun has included China's maximum demands, and China may not expect the Council to accept them all. In addition, British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Foreign Minister Bonnet expressed sympathy for China when they met with Ambassador Gu a few days ago, which has satisfied Chinese people here. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, Gu Weijun, the chief Chinese representative, appealed to the United States to urge the European powers to implement joint action to boycott Japan. According to authoritative reports, Gu, citing President Roosevelt's message to Congress, stated to the US Minister to Switzerland, Harrison, that China could still win if various countries boycotted Japan. Rumor here is that Britain and France are hesitant to get involved in the Far East dispute due to the current situation in Europe. According to usually reliable sources, the secret meeting of the Council of the League of Nations has in fact rejected China's most important request to the Council - to organize an adjustment committee. Most observers here believe that France, due to Italy's ambitions, and Britain, due to Germany's development in Europe, are unwilling to interfere in the Far East. Gu believes that the United States is the most sympathetic country to China, so he hopes to obtain joint action outside the League of Nations to boycott Japan.

<h3>France Finds it Difficult to Recognize Unilateral Treaty Revision; Document Delivered to Japanese Foreign Ministry</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, an official from the French Embassy, representing French Ambassador Henry, delivered a document from the French government to the Japanese Foreign Ministry. The document was drafted by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is heard that it was transmitted to Tokyo at night. The document followed the precedents of the United States and Britain, stating that it was unwilling to endorse the unilateral amendment to the Nine-Power Treaty guaranteeing China's territorial integrity and administrative sovereignty. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Times recently published a dispatch from a visitor to Tokyo, stating that after the governments of the United States, Britain, and France successively submitted notes to the Japanese government regarding the need to respect the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, the reaction issued by the Japanese side was very subtle, and did not seem to be officially authorized. Although the Japanese government may not submit a reply quickly, some illusions have been shattered by the submission of such notes by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France. "Now, to transform China into a Japanese colony is not considered an easy task even on the Japanese side, but the country's army has already won victories, and the omnipotent countries have also achieved success in Europe, which is where Japan's bewilderment lies. The economic and military security that Japan wants to obtain today can only be obtained in a way that is less severe and more mitigating. It is impossible not to reconsider. Although this is a difficult task, how can Japan's plan to encompass East Asia to complete its self-sufficient group be reconciled with the demands put forward by various civilized countries? It is still difficult to say so far. It is expected that Japan's first step in the future will be to re-provide empty guarantees, stating that once the 'New Order in East Asia' is established, the trade interests retained by the countries concerned will not only not be damaged, but can also be expected to increase."

<h3>Prominent Figures From All Walks of Life in the United States Oppose Japanese Aggression; Stimson and Others Establish a New Association; Advocate for Embargoing War Materials to Japan</h3>
<p>(New York) American people who oppose Japanese aggression against China have recently organized an association called the "American Committee Not to Aid Japan in Violence," and elected former Secretary of State Stimson and former Consul-General in Hankou, Green, as chairmen. The purpose of the association is to absolutely prohibit the export of military equipment or raw materials that can be used for military needs from the United States to Japan. Not only metals such as steel and copper, but also large trucks for transporting goods are on the list of prohibited items. The members of the association are mostly well-known people in society, such as Harvard University President Lowell, former Ambassador to Germany Dodd, and others who are most well-known. In addition to directly contacting American exporters, the association will also conduct publicity work in newspapers to encourage members of Congress to propose legislation to ban the export of ships. (Haitong News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) New York State Republican Congressman Fishcher recently submitted a bill to the House of Representatives, advocating that all military equipment be prohibited from export, with offenders subject to imprisonment for no less than one year and no more than five years, and a fine of $6,000. The military equipment transported will also be confiscated. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<h3>Shigemitsu Aoi Promotes to Britain; Full of Goodwill and Peace</h3>
<p>(London) The Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Shigemitsu, delivered a tactful speech at a banquet held by the Japan Association last night, strongly stating that he firmly believed in open diplomacy, and that many propagandists who write about the situation in Japan mostly do not know Japanese or are not familiar with the Japanese language, which is a pity. This kind of lack of understanding will inevitably lead to unpleasant results, because the true facts are almost all arbitrarily distorted. If he could discuss recent events, he could make listeners understand the truth of the situation, but other places have not fully paid attention to this. Now, I only have one word to tell you, that is, we are now wholeheartedly following a path, wanting to create lasting peace and prosperity in one part of our world. Friendly relations with China are especially our wish. We earnestly try to eliminate all suspicions and doubts, and replace them with mutual understanding, in order to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, so as to introduce a new era of lasting cooperation and reconciliation. He meant that now is the time for the two island nations in the East and West to jointly form their increasing peace policy, because the friendship between Britain and Japan is the main pillar of world peace, and without this, peace is in danger. British-Japanese friendship is a major and inseparable part of the structure of peace and appeasement. There are certain elements who wish to see the British-Japanese relationship fall into hopeless tension. The two countries each have their extremist factions, but if we can understand and trust each other, these people will not be harmful. Therefore, the two countries should observe the situation with real sincerity, and no matter what happens, we should remain friendly as before. We must also deal with the current political situation calmly and rationally, and not allow temporary impulses to disrupt our ability to judge, because once the clouds clear and the sun appears, we will see our lasting friendship shining like the Alpine peaks in the sunlight."

Afterwards, he also made a statement to the newspapers, saying, "China's war of resistance continues as before. China and Japan will still continue to fight for a long time. One thing can be asserted: The essence of aerial bombardment is not enough to bring victory." The morale of the Chinese people is still very strong, and they are very optimistic about the future. Cities that have been bombed by airplanes can resume their daily lives as soon as the alarm is lifted. The vitality of the Chinese people is such that the entire territory of China has not been universally affected by the flames of war. Ambassador Johnson is scheduled to visit President Roosevelt tomorrow. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Council Meeting Discusses Spanish Events; Aerial Bombardment of Undefended Cities; The Actions of the Aggressor Country Are Inhumane; Spanish Foreign Minister Expresses Determination to Resist</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After holding a secret meeting this afternoon to discuss the Sino-Japanese dispute, the Council of the League of Nations immediately opened a public meeting to discuss the issue of the aerial bombardment of undefended cities in Spain. The representative of the Spanish Republican government, namely the country's Foreign Minister Del Vayo, immediately delivered a speech, stating that according to the report submitted by the British investigator, the incident of rebel planes bombing ordinary people in the territory under the jurisdiction of the Republican government was obviously intentional. I believe that these planes belong to Germany and Italy. If you ask the Spanish people to disregard this brazenly and even slaughter innocent compatriots in their own country, I really "cannot believe it." Seeing that the Italian newspapers often publish articles praising the achievements of the country's pilots, it is known that what I said is not false. Although the Spanish government army will never retaliate against ordinary people in the occupied areas, "The humanitarian policy pursued by the Republican government will never be changed." As far as the issue of the withdrawal of foreign volunteers is concerned, the Republican government has decided to withdraw all foreign combatants under its command, and some of them have already left Spain. On the Italian side, it is announced that aid to the rebels will be stepped up until final victory is obtained. The difference in attitude between the two is as such. At this point, Foreign Minister Del Vayo concluded, "The people of Spain have decided to resist aggression, and this determination will never waver." After Del Vayo finished speaking, the British representative, namely the Foreign Office official Butler, stated that the aerial bombardment had created a catastrophe in Spain, and hoped that it could be corrected. The Soviet representative, namely Ambassador to France Suritz, continued to speak, praising the heroic spirit of the Spanish nation in resisting "unprovoked aggression," and said that the League of Nations should take action to make international law respected. The Soviet government is prepared to participate in all measures to end the Spanish civil war. The Chinese representative, namely Ambassador to France Gu Weijun, also expressed sympathy for the Spanish people, and said that "Air warfare is not enough to destroy the determination of combatants. It is one of the most useless forms of warfare." It is necessary for all countries to ban the transportation of aviation fuel to Spain. The French representative, Chaflia, finally spoke, condemning various "barbaric warfare methods" and saying that France is prepared to participate in all actions aimed at stopping such acts.

<h3>Italy Openly Violates the Non-Intervention Agreement; The Spanish Government Protests to Britain; Fierce Fighting on the Catalan Front</h3>

The Spanish Ambassador requested that the document be forwarded to the Non-Intervention Committee. The document cited the "Jane's Fighting Ships Information" stating that the National Army government had purchased four destroyers and two submarines from Italy in 1937. The document stated at the end that the sale of warships was an open violation of the non-intervention agreement by the Italian government. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Barcelona: According to an official report released by the government army's Ministry of Defense last night, there was fierce fighting on all lines in Catalonia yesterday.

<h3>France's Non-Intervention Policy in the Spanish War Remains Unchanged; The Communist Party's Request to Open Border Restrictions Is Rejected by the House Committee</h3>
<p>(Paris) Responsible figures here recently announced that Foreign Minister Bonnet will attend the House of Representatives tomorrow or Friday to explain foreign policy, and will announce that the French government has decided to continue to implement its non-intervention policy in the Spanish civil war. Afterwards, the House of Representatives will submit a motion proposed by Radical Socialist Congressman Zschelle for a vote, which advocates maintaining the non-intervention policy, but also maintaining the freedom and security of France's communication with its territories. Although the Socialist Party and the Communist Party hold opposing views, the government can still win a large majority of votes. (Havas dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The House Army Committee yesterday overwhelmingly rejected the Communist Party's motion requesting the government to open the Spanish border and transport war materials into Spain. Although leftist newspapers are advocating opening the border, the French government seems to have no intention of changing its current policy. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>Report to the Cabinet by the British Prime Minister: The Course of the Talks in Rome. Attlee Requests Assistance with Arms for the Western Government; Prime Minister Chamberlain Replies That It Is Inexpedient to Comply.</h3>
<p>(London) According to a Reuters Parliamentary correspondent, Prime Minister Chamberlain's report to the Cabinet on his visit to Rome was generally in line with the well-informed intelligence released by British sources in Rome at the conclusion of the visit. Cabinet members appeared satisfied with the general effect of the trip. The government seemed to have no doubts that the Anglo-Italian agreement would be fully implemented. The correspondent also stated that regarding the situation in Spain, the Italians are unlikely to withdraw before Franco achieves victory. There seems to be no concern about any future intervention in the Spanish Civil War by any party. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Following a letter from Major Attlee, leader of the opposition Labour Party, to Prime Minister Chamberlain requesting an immediate convening of Parliament to discuss the Spanish issue and for the British government to join other nations in assisting the Spanish Republic, Chamberlain has replied, expressing his opposition, stating: "If the ban on the shipment of arms to Spain were to be lifted, the scope of the civil war in Spain would inevitably expand as a result. While the consequences of this are difficult to foresee, they would certainly be very serious. The British government does not consider it expedient to comply. Moreover, Parliament will reconvene within two weeks, and it is not clear what benefit would be gained by convening it earlier under the current circumstances." However, the British government will provide assistance to relief efforts conducted by various non-governmental organizations to facilitate the shipment of food to Spain to prevent famine.

<h3>Rajchman Reportedly to Resign; His Technical Cooperation to Aid China Is Deeply Resented by the Japanese.</h3>
<p>(Geneva) According to inquiries made by reporters with the League of Nations Secretariat, Dr. Rajchman, founder and head of the League of Nations Health Organization, is likely to be dismissed by the League of Nations Secretary-General, Avenol, under the pretext of budgetary constraints and staff reductions. Rajchman has headed the League of Nations Health Organization for seventeen years and is the initiator and representative of the League's technical cooperation with China. As a result, the Japanese side has frequently attacked Rajchman, accusing him of being biased towards the Chinese. In recent years, Fascist elements have criticized Rajchman's advocacy of collective security and democratic politics. Although the order for Rajchman's dismissal has not yet been formally announced, it is understood that he generally plans to leave the League of Nations Secretariat in early February. (18th)</p>

<h3>US to Build Defenses on Guam; Japan Expresses Extreme Panic, Saying It Is No Different Than Pointing a Gun at a Neighbor's Door. US Naval Base Expansion Plan Approved by the President.</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has approved a proposal by the Navy to establish new naval bases in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The *New York Times*' Washington correspondent has learned that the plan has been approved for an appropriation of US$60 million to begin construction of a major naval port on Guam Island. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Representative Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, stated that he would be introducing a new measure today to implement the proposed establishment of forty-one small air and naval bases. He also stated that he did not know whether the proposal included the proposed fortification of Guam. Japan attaches particular importance to the proposal to fortify Guam. Representative Vinson said that the proposal is now in President Roosevelt's hands, and he does not intend to disclose its contents before the full text is made public, reportedly to avoid unnecessarily provoking Japan. Local circles are paying close attention to Tokyo's report that a Japanese naval spokesman stated that the fortification of Guam is an unfriendly act towards Japan, no different than "pointing a gun at its neighbor's door." Naval experts also say that establishing naval bases far from the mainland is intended to attack Japan from nearby. (Associated Press, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Rear Admiral Kanazawa, a spokesman for the Navy Ministry, stated today at a weekly press conference in response to a question from a foreign journalist about the US fortification of Guam, that Guam is very far from the US but very close to Japan's mandated islands in the South Pacific. The islands under Japanese mandate are surrounded by US territories, such as Hawaii, Midway, Guam, and the Philippines. If Guam is fortified, Japan will not be able to defend its undefended mandated islands in the South Pacific. Japanese naval policy is based on the principles of non-threat and non-aggression, so it must pay serious attention to this situation. Japan aims to have a fleet that can adequately defend the Western Pacific, but it is hardly sufficient to take offensive action. The spokesman also stated that it should be very clear, even to the average person, that the Japanese Navy cannot engage in any long-distance transoceanic warfare. Although rumors abound, Japan will never be able to build a great navy overnight for the purpose of crossing the ocean and fighting. Rear Admiral Kanazawa concluded by saying that he did not understand the policy of the US naval authorities to plan to establish air and submarine bases on Guam as a forward station for transoceanic warfare. Japan has no unfriendly sentiments towards the US, and it seems unlikely that the US would plan to treat Japan in an unfriendly manner. However, if the US does fortify Guam, Japan will not be able to defend its mandated islands in the South Pacific, so this type of action is not only unfriendly but also a very serious threat to Japan. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Republican Senator Borah stated that the US does not intend to strengthen the defenses of Guam for the time being and make it a naval base. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Representative Vinson, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, stated that he supports the Navy Department's proposal to strengthen the defense of Guam, located among the islands under Japanese mandate, making it an impregnable air and naval base. According to information revealed by Vinson, his recently proposed naval bill allocates $5,000,000 to begin the work of defending Guam. Vinson said, "I personally strongly support defending Guam, but I don't know what the Bureau of the Budget will do with the $5,000,000 appropriation." President Roosevelt warned Washington reporters today that it would be best to wait for naval experts to make a formal request for funding before talking about defending Guam. State Department officials and members of Congress criticized the proposal to defend Guam, taking the position that it would not harm Guam. Army Air Corps Captain Arnold told the House Military Affairs Committee yesterday that for the US to make proper defenses, it would need to build new air bases in Puerto Rico, Alaska, and Hawaii. Two new bases would also be needed on the American continent. He said that building these five bases, preparing 3,000 new aircraft, and increasing the training of a large number of personnel were all urgent matters. Other military officials warned the Congressional committee that an indestructible line of defense should be built on the Panama Canal to ensure that the American fleet could move freely on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts in the event of war.

<h3>US Congress Discussing National Defense Plan; General Arnold Explains the Necessity of Strengthening the Air Force.</h3>
<p>(Washington) The first of President Roosevelt's fourteen massive armament plans was submitted to the Congressional Military Affairs Committee for discussion yesterday. The plan recommends increasing the US Air Force to 6,000 first-line aircraft and 51,000 Air Force personnel, and also stipulates an outline for improving the US aircraft industry. (Haitong, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Congressman General Arnold, the current head of the Army Air Corps, stated today that the US should build four new air bases in the next two years to complete the defense of the American continent: one in Puerto Rico, one in Alaska, and two on the American continent. The air base in Hawaii should be expanded. Arnold emphasized the importance of increasing the nation's large-scale aircraft manufacturing capacity and specifically proposed that Congress should approve the abandonment of competitive bidding for private aircraft manufacturing so that the aircraft manufacturing industry could start manufacturing as quickly as possible and increase the number of aircraft by at least 3,000, as requested by President Roosevelt. They would abandon competitive bidding in an emergency. He meant that we are now facing an emergency, and Congress should change the law. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<h3>US Government Reduces Silver Price; Production Decreased Last Year.</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to a government announcement today, the total amount of silver produced in the United States in 1938 was 61,560,000 ounces, worth $39,796,000. Compared to the production in 1937, last year's production decreased by 15%. In terms of value, it decreased by 29% compared to 1937, because the government's silver price in 1938 was 64.64 cents, while in 1937 it was 77.3 cents. (Associated Press, 18th)</p>
<h3>Germany and Hungary Strengthen Relations; Hungarian Foreign Minister to Visit Berlin to Discuss Economic Cooperation Between the Two Countries.</h3>
<p>(Berlin) When Hungarian Foreign Minister Csáky repaid his visit to Germany, he consulted with German leaders on everything. Now that things have been accomplished, the German government has issued a communique stating that the talks between the Hungarian Foreign Minister and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop have shown that the two countries' foreign policies are completely consistent. The friendship between the two countries will be even deeper in the future. The close unity between Germany and Hungary is the best guarantee for the continued development of appeasement efforts in Europe, just like the close relationship between Hungary and Italy. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to reports here last night, German officials are very satisfied with the results of the German-Hungarian talks conducted during the Hungarian Foreign Minister's visit to Berlin. Although the details are not yet known, it is understood from reliable sources that Csáky informed the German government that Hungary would soon decide to withdraw from the League of Nations. At the same time, there will be a new agreement regarding the status of the German minority in Hungary. The Hungarian government will pass laws based on this agreement to protect the political, cultural, and economic rights of the 600,000 German minorities. It is even possible that the German ethnic group will have representation in the Hungarian government. (Haitong, 19th)</p>
<p>Prague. The Czech Foreign Minister is scheduled to visit Berlin on the 21st of this month to repay a visit. The main topic of discussion will be economic issues, including a currency and customs union between Germany and Czechoslovakia. However, these types of issues are extremely complex, and it is difficult to predict whether a decision can be reached soon. As for rumors that Czechoslovakia will join the Anti-Comintern Pact, well-informed sources here have stated that the Czech government has not yet considered this issue. (Haitong, 19th)</p>
<h3>German Parliament to Convene at the End of the Month; Hitler to Deliver a Speech; Rumors of Government Reshuffle Are Inaccurate.</h3>
<p>(Berlin) It is heard that German leader Hitler is preparing to deliver a lengthy speech at the parliamentary session on January 30. It is estimated that this speech will be specifically for domestic consumption, detailing the major events of the past year and briefly outlining future directions. However, official circles have not yet made a formal announcement regarding this. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Official circles do not acknowledge the rumors that there will be changes in the German government. Foreign newspapers have recently carried rumors of the propaganda minister Goebbels' position being shaken. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The "Daily Mail" recently published a dispatch from its Berlin correspondent, stating that German leader Hitler intends to reshuffle the cabinet, with the current Minister of Aviation and dictator of the Four-Year Economic Plan, General Göring, as cabinet coordinator and Minister of Defense, and the current Chief of the Political Police, Himmler, as Minister of the Interior, succeeding Frick.

<h3>King of the Shara Banner and Entourage Arrive in Xi'an Yesterday.</h3>
<p>(Xi'an) King of the Shara Banner (Ikh Zhao League) and his entourage, numbering over thirty, traveled south a month ago, passing through Yulin and other places, and arrived in Xi'an by car at 2 p.m. on the 19th. Chairman Chiang's representative, Li Zhigang, and over a hundred representatives from various organizations and groups welcomed them in the western suburbs. The King of the Shara Banner went to rest in the city and then visited Chairman Chiang. In the evening, Chiang hosted a banquet for the King of the Shara Banner at his private residence, with members of the provincial government in attendance. According to the King of the Shara Banner, who spoke to the Central News Agency reporter, he decided to travel south to pay respects to Chairman Lin and Chairman Chiang in Chongqing, report on the Banner's affairs, and take up his new position as a member of the National Government. Currently, the monks and civilians of the Shara Banner are working hard on the war of resistance, and their morale is very high. They plan to rest in Shaanxi for a short time before proceeding to Chongqing. (19th)</p>

Both have been sent to the Central Government as usual to be forwarded to the National Government. (19th)</p>
<h3>Salt Stored on the Zhejiang Coast Is Transported Inland in Its Entirety.</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Since the War of Resistance, the important salt-producing areas of the Chinese coast have largely lost their effectiveness. Only the Zhejiang area is still able to produce salt. However, because the salt fields are mostly close to the battle lines, Japanese warships harass them from time to time. Furthermore, it is inconvenient to transport the salt inland, and it is inherently difficult to sell it abroad. Normally, the salt produced in the Zhejiang area is only used to supply the food needs of the province. Now, after several months of effort, the Zhejiang Transportation Office has transported all the salt stored in the coastal fields to the interior, not only maintaining the food supply for the people of Jiangxi, Hunan, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, but also increasing the national treasury's revenue by 30 million yuan.

<h3>Han Guojun Asks the Executive Yuan to Allocate Funds for River Dredging.</h3>
<p>Huaiyin. Officials and gentry of Jiangsu Province have repeatedly telegraphed the Central Government, requesting that the Yellow River breach be blocked. Subsequently, they received a telegram from the Executive Yuan stating that the breach could not be blocked and the river water would not recede, and that the ten counties of Gaobao would become a swamp. A committee was specially formed to dredge the waterway to the sea, and Han Guojun was appointed as the chairman. He is now actively proceeding with the work. The total estimated cost of the project is about one million yuan. Because the people of the province are impoverished and unable to raise this large sum, Han has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, earnestly requesting an allocation of funds to complete the great work.

<h3>Guangdong Guerrillas Threaten the Japanese Army; The Japanese Army Vigorously Retracts Its Defense Line on the East River; The Main Force Is Stationed in Dongguan to Protect Humen.</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: The war in Guangdong Province has recently become a seesaw battle. From the perspective of the overall situation, the Japanese army is in a passive position. Although it occupies the Guangzhou area, it is being attacked everywhere. Where the military strength is weak, it cannot defend against the guerrilla warfare of the Chinese army units. Where the troops are concentrated, it must defend against air raids by the Chinese Air Force. Therefore, the Japanese army stationed in various districts has been constantly transferred. Even the transportation of military supplies is done using auxiliary vehicles. Often, when transporting ammunition, the boxes are filled with broken bricks and tiles to deceive and confuse and prevent guerrilla teams from intercepting them, a cunning plan. As for the Japanese warships blockading the coast, they are also frequently transferred or have their numbers repainted to confuse the Chinese army. As for the Japanese steamers sailing into the inland rivers, when they forcibly enter, the first few ships have no soldiers, only a driver is responsible for driving. The soldiers on the side of the ship are mostly disguised or planted with plastic human figures to make the Chinese army mistake them for living people and shoot at them. The above points demonstrate the emptiness and cowardice of the Japanese army. Conversely, after withdrawing from Guangzhou, the Chinese army gathered in advantageous areas, waited at ease, and took the opportunity to attack. It first used guerrilla teams for large-scale active warfare, and it has recently been successful. It is said that the guerrillas in the East River area are the most active. The recent abandonment of Huizhou, Boluo, and Zengcheng by the Japanese army was due to the pressure from the guerrillas in the Luofu Mountain area and the fear that the battle line was too long and that the rear would be cut off. Therefore, the Japanese army in Huizhou, Boluo, and Zengcheng gradually retreated to the line west of the Kowloon Railway, one way to defend the city of Dongguan to protect Humen, and the other way to defend the south of Zengcheng, forming a mutual defense with the Japanese army in Conghua and Huaxian. At the same time, they increased troops in Shilong and Shitan to resist the Chinese army on the east road from driving straight down to Humen and attacking Guangzhou. They also increased troops to more than 5,000 people in Shitan, Xintang, and Nangang (all stations on the Chinese section of the Kowloon Railway) below Shilong. They further tightened the construction of defensive fortifications below Shitan. The headquarters of the Japanese army on the east road is reportedly located in Nangang. From Guangzhou Dasha Tou Station to Shitan Station, the Japanese army uses the military train to transport troops, and their activities are frequent. At the moment, the Chinese army on the east road is waiting for the northern road in Conghua to succeed before launching a large-scale attack on Shilong, attacking Shitan, and also attacking the back of the eastern suburbs of Guangzhou from Conghua along the Guang Fan Hua Road. Then, the Japanese army along the Kowloon Railway will not be difficult to cut off and solve in segments.</p>
<p>The Japanese army is also aware of the tense situation east of Guangzhou. On the one hand, it is shortening the defense line step by step. On the other hand, it is stationing its main force in the city of Dongguan to check the Dongguan-Taiping Highway and prepare to cover the Japanese when they retreat and escape from Humen and board ships. In early this month, the Japanese army regarded Humen as an important stronghold and sent a team to search for weapons in Shiqiao and Shawan, which are outside the defense of Humen. They were severely attacked by the local self-defense forces. However, the Japanese army still did not hesitate to use the force of a lion fighting a rabbit and used the air force to bomb. As a result, hundreds of houses were destroyed and hundreds of innocent people were killed in Shawan and Shiqiao. At that time, the self-defense forces dispersed, and the Japanese army could not pursue them, only looting civilian property. Shiqiao and Shawan are not important areas, but the Japanese army is eager to invade them to prevent the guerrillas in the two places from raiding Humen and had to send a large army to their location to implement their plan of preemptive action.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Taihu Lake Makes a Surprise Attack on Puppet Troops; Puppet Squad Leader Is Killed.</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: On the night of the 15th, 60 or 70 guerrillas arrived at Xiangshan Zui Town on the west bank of Taihu Lake and attacked the 7th Company of the 3rd Garrison Brigade of puppet troops stationed there. The puppet captain Song Junlong fought in a panic in the dark. When the battle lasted until dawn, the Chinese army retreated to Taihu Lake after completing its mission. In this battle, the puppet squad leader Xu Chunfa and more than ten puppet soldiers, including Wu Jixiang, were killed. The puppet army lost one machine gun and many rifles. The puppet captain Song Junlong was also seriously wounded by bullets. The Japanese army stationed in Suzhou is currently transferring troops to assist.</p>
<h3>Wuhu Under the Iron Heel of the Japanese Army: Major and Minor Traitors Rely on Their Power and Run Rampant; Unharmed Houses Are All Occupied; Chinese Troops Control Areas Outside the City</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Wuhu is located on the south bank of the Yangtze River, upstream from Nanjing, and is the only major commercial port in Anhui Province. Major local products from southern and central Anhui, such as rice, tea, silk, and eggs, are all exported from here, and imported goods such as silk, satin, oil, sugar, and foreign goods are also transferred to the interior from here. The city is prosperous, with a population of about 200,000. Important main roads in the city, such as Zhongshan Road, Beiping Road, Erjie, and Siming Road, have all been widened and rebuilt, and have become modern roads. There are highways such as the Jingwu Line (from Nanjing to Wuhu) and the Wutun Line (from Wuhu to Tunxi), the Wuwei Line (from Wuhu across the river to Wuwei County), and railways such as the Jingsun Line of the Jiangnan Railway (from Nanjing to Sunjia in Xuancheng) and the Yuhe Line of the Huainan Railway (from Yuhan across the river from Wuhu to Taifei). Various shipping companies on the Yangtze River have set up lighter wharves and warehouses in Wuhu, and water and land transportation is very convenient. At the beginning of the August 13th Resistance War, a large number of people from along the Nanjing-Shanghai line fled to Wuhu, so before the city fell, the population increased and the market was prosperous. When Guangde fell and Yicheng was suddenly bombed, the people of Wuhu were greatly panicked. Then Wuhu was also bombed, and the people fled in all directions, the situation was extremely tragic. The Administrative Commissioner's Office withdrew to Wuwei County. Soon after, the vanguard of the Japanese army, from Gaochun in Jiangsu, via Shuiyang and Wuxi (under the jurisdiction of Dangtu County), arrived in Wuhu and carried out large-scale arson, looting, rape, and murder, with endless cruel acts. Later, under the instigation of the Japanese army's pacification team, corrupt officials, corrupt bureaucrats, treacherous merchants, local bullies, and vagrants established the so-called "Autonomous Committee." The puppet chairman was Zhu Xiufeng, and the puppet members were Zai Mengshou, Yu Shuoping, Xie Xuelin, Zai Zidong, Wang Xiaofu, Wang Shancheng, Wei Minqiang, Song Jiemei, Li Huinong, etc. These puppet members, seeing that the local area was scarred and the population was sparse, with nothing to do, pleaded with the Japanese side for permission to confiscate all the salt stored in the salt merchants' warehouses, the rice stored in the local granaries, and the goods from the unguarded shops in the whole port, as well as the clothes stolen by the poor, etc., and sell them collectively. The organization for selling stolen goods was euphemistically called a cooperative, headed by Zai Shancheng. Because Wang's younger brother, Zidong, had studied in Japan and was familiar with Japanese, he was able to get close to the Japanese side. The proceeds from the sale of stolen goods, in addition to most of them being reported to the Japanese side, were divided among the puppets. Although Zhu Xiufeng, as the puppet chairman, had no actual power, the remaining puppets had internal strife due to conflicts of interest, which led to Wang Xiaofu, Wei Minqiang, and Song Jiemei being detained and dismissed by the Japanese side one after another. At the same time, local thugs such as Ren Fengchang, who practiced boxing and performed arts, Tao Xifen, a former employee of the Japanese Consulate in Wuhu, and Peng Yangwu, who had been an interpreter at a Japanese hospital, were all employed by the Japanese army, held puppet positions, and relied on their power to run rampant. At present, the order in the city is extremely chaotic, because the Japanese army has no discipline, breaking into people's homes to molest women, demanding items, etc., has become commonplace, so nine out of ten residential areas in the city are empty, and no one dares to live there. The houses along Zhongshan Road are mostly occupied by the Japanese to open shops. The types of businesses, in addition to cotton yarn, tobacco, groceries, and sugar, also include many brothels and restaurants. Each Japanese merchant also sells drugs, so the atmosphere of drugs is everywhere, and more and more civilians are addicted. In addition to Japanese businesses, most are peddlers. Formal shops are one in a hundred. All the houses in the port, except for those that have been destroyed, the better and larger houses, whether public or private or agency residences, are occupied by the Japanese army or the Japanese. The owners not only cannot recover them, but are not even allowed to inspect them inside the houses. Japanese military vehicles in the streets and markets crash and speed at extremely high speeds, and the number of wronged souls under the wheels is unknown. Although the Japanese army occupies Wuhu, it can only be stationed in the city, and five miles outside the city is completely under the control of guerrillas. The Japanese army stationed in Wuhu had previously attempted to establish contact with the Japanese army in Wanzhi, 20 kilometers away from Wuhu, but failed due to interception by the New Fourth Army and other guerrillas. The Wuhu County Government is now located in a certain place in the southeastern township of the county, and the administrative system has not been interrupted. The puppet Autonomous Committee has now been reorganized into a puppet "County Public Office," still headed by Zhu Xiufeng as the puppet county magistrate, and Zai Mengshou, Yu Shuoping, and Bao Guangqing as puppet section chiefs, who took office shamelessly on New Year's Day. It is said that they are planning to levy various harsh taxes and levies to fund the puppet government. The people, under the double oppression of the Japanese army and the Chinese traitors, are all complaining bitterly.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Jiangyin Stationed in Various Townships; Puppet County Office Attempts to Collect Land Tax; Civilian Houses Outside the City Are Demolished</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Correspondence: After the establishment of the Cheng County puppet government, the major and minor puppets, seeing that the expenses were quite large, pleaded with the Japanese army to be stationed in the townships and towns, block the ports, and oppress the peasants, in order to collect land tax for relief. At present, there are Japanese troops stationed in various townships and towns, such as Qiaoqi, Beiguo, Nanguo, Qingyang, Nanzha, Lujiaqiao, Hucaogang, Zhangjiagang, and Shiyiwu Port, with twenty or thirty soldiers in each place. These Japanese troops go to nearby villages every day to search for chickens, pigs, eggs, and beef. If there are young women, they even want to rape them, changing from the kind of gentle policy and small favors they had a few months ago to a hideous face. In the areas occupied by the Japanese army, sentries are stationed on all transportation routes by water and land. People passing by, if they forget to bow, are slapped and kicked, or even stabbed and shot, and may lose their lives at any moment. Moreover, people are forced by life to engage in small businesses, and even a piece of firewood or a grain of rice passing through the towns and townships where the Japanese troops are stationed is forcibly extorted. If they are slightly dissatisfied, danger will come immediately, so people regard walking as a fearful journey. The guerrillas are all outside the southeast gates of the city, which the Japanese hate very much. A few days ago, they ordered the puppet county government to demolish all the civilian houses near the city outside the south gate, fearing that the guerrillas would hide there and be detrimental to the Japanese troops in the city. Even the Shui Guan fence wood was newly made, and the gate was lowered every night, showing a ridiculous state of fear.</p>

<h3>Chickenpox Rampant This Year: The Issue of "Hair-inducing Foods"</h3>
<p>— You Xuezhou</p>
<p>Regardless of the type of rash-related illness, when the rash is about to erupt or is not fully erupted, one always feels epigastric fullness, restlessness, and an indescribable feeling. Once it has fully erupted, one feels slightly better, and only when it is completely erupted does one feel comfortable. Therefore, when encountering rash-related illnesses such as chickenpox, measles, varicella, scarlet fever, etc., the main task is to promote eruption. In the case of chickenpox, there is a custom of eating "hair-inducing foods," the purpose of which is to promote rapid eruption. However, the eruptive methods of food and medicine are very different in their effects. The current outbreak of chickenpox seems unsuitable for the "hair-inducing foods" approach, so I am pointing this out specifically.</p>
<p>"Hair-inducing foods" are divided into meat and vegetarian categories. In the case of chickenpox, vegetarian foods are used when the spots appear, and meat foods are used when the blisters are forming. Vegetarian "hair-inducing foods" include winter bamboo shoots, bamboo shoot tips, shiitake mushrooms, and straw mushrooms. The principle of vegetarian "hair-inducing foods" is not very clear. It is generally believed that their fresh flavor promotes certain secretions and activities, causing the rash to increase. As for the blister fluid, it is entirely brewed from qi and blood. Therefore, when qi and blood are abundant, the fluid is sufficient; when qi and blood are weak, the fluid is thin. Chicken soup and similar foods have a nourishing effect, which can increase qi and blood.</p>
<p>The current outbreak of chickenpox is characterized by its violent nature and its symptoms as being substantial. Clearing heat and detoxifying is the main task. When the spots appear, hair-inducing foods should not be used. If the spots are already densely distributed without gaps, adding hair-inducing foods would be like adding fuel to the fire. When doctors use ingredients such as schizonepeta, cimicifuga, and peucedanum at this time, it is not solely for the purpose of promoting eruption. Rather, the medicinal properties contain clearing and detoxifying components, which are different from winter bamboo shoots and bamboo shoot tips and cannot be equated. In my experience, when the blisters are forming in chickenpox, they often appear scorched and purplish. The insufficient fluid is caused by internal heat and stagnation. Qi and blood deficiency is rarely seen. If clearing and detoxifying are not enough, how dare we tell patients to drink chicken soup or mutton soup? Even if a patient asks about eating hair-inducing foods, I would definitely refuse to prevent any complications. If the condition is qi and blood deficiency and the fluid is clear rather than turbid, then "meat-based hair-inducing foods" may be given. Patients should pay close attention to this!</p>
<h3>Treatment of Insomnia</h3>
<p>— Ye Jinqiu</p>
<p>Speaking of insomnia, it is really very painful. Those who have not experienced it simply cannot imagine it. "He seeks her sleeping and waking; he tosses and turns." This is because of longing, which leads to neglecting sleep and food. This type of insomnia will eventually be compensated with a sweet state. Moreover, insomnia caused by something one is thinking about is not as embarrassing. Only the insomnia of neurasthenia, that kind of dispirited state, is truly the most painful thing in the world. Neurasthenia is a modern disease of the times. Those who truly want to cultivate themselves should return to their true nature and quickly leave the city. Because the stimulation of sound and light, the dazzling colors, the temptations of lasciviousness, and the pressure of life, even the young and strong will inevitably suffer from dizziness, blurred vision, and unclear hearing.</p>
<p>Insomniacs with neurasthenia are mostly those who overuse their brains. Its manifestation is that the more it gets to the evening, the more energetic they become. Once they undress and go to bed, all kinds of miscellaneous thoughts will immediately come to mind. The more they try to quiet their minds, the more impossible it becomes. Then, they count their own breaths, but soon start to daydream, like a wild horse that cannot be restrained. Listening to the ticking of the clock pendulum makes them even more irritable and unable to rest. One moment their mouth is dry, the next moment they urinate. It is not until dawn, when they are extremely exhausted, that they can close their eyes and fall into a dazed, hazy sleep. After getting up, they are listless, reluctant to speak, hate hearing noises, and are easily angered. I have been through this myself, so I am very clear about this situation.</p>
<p>There are many causes of insomnia. The prescriptions of our country are not as consistent as those of specific tranquilizers, and there are different established methods. Regarding this, I would like to write another article. What I want to introduce now is an effective prescription for neurasthenic insomnia, which is relatively more common. This prescription has a great origin and a long history. It is Huanglian Agiao Jizihuang Tang (Coptis, Donkey-hide Gelatin and Egg Yolk Decoction) from Zhang Zhongjing of the Han Dynasty. The medicine uses coptis, scutellaria, white peony, donkey-hide gelatin, and egg yolk. It contains a lot of gelatin. Using gelatinous medicine to treat neurasthenia is definitely appropriate. People with the same disease, please try it!</p>
<h3>How to Adjust Diet Based on Hot and Cold Body Types</h3>
<p>— Yan Cangshan</p>
<p>People's physical constitutions are different, and can be roughly divided into two types: hot and cold. If one does not have medical knowledge and indulges in food according to personal preferences, it often leads to an imbalance of hot and cold, causing illness unknowingly. I will explain them separately below:</p>
<p>(1) How to distinguish a hot body type and what foods to avoid: Those who are naturally prone to heat will often have constipation, yellow urine, a preference for fruits and tea, are not very afraid of the cold in winter, have a stronger pulse than average, and are prone to toothache, eye pain, throat swelling, sore throat, hemorrhoids, blood in the stool, oily ears, heat boils, dizziness, facial flushing, teeth grinding during sleep, hives, nocturnal emissions, insomnia, and red phlegm. In women, they often suffer from leukorrhea and metrorrhagia. Seeing one or two of these symptoms indicates a heat condition, and it is not necessary to see all of them. They should avoid eating a lot of chili peppers, fried foods, fragrant and dry foods, mutton, sorghum wine, and various wild game. Simple tonics such as longan, red dates, lychee, deer antler glue, tiger bone glue, and Biezhicang ginseng are also forbidden.</p>
<p>(2) How to distinguish a cold body type and what foods to avoid: Those who are naturally prone to cold will often have loose stools, clear and long urine, no thirst, abdominal pain or vomiting of clear water when eating raw or cold foods, cough with a lot of phlegm and shortness of breath in winter, a white and slippery tongue coating, a slower pulse than average and weak to the touch, and spontaneous sweating when moving. Even in summer, they dislike fans. These are all signs of visceral cold and dampness. They should avoid eating a lot of gypsum tofu, jellyfish skin, ark shells, crabs, oyster meat, soft-shelled turtles, eels, carp, cabbage, fresh radish, tea beans, fruits, yellow wine, and other cold foods. Simple tonics such as bird's nest, white fungus, turtle glue, donkey-hide gelatin, and American ginseng are also inappropriate.</p>
<p>If there are no signs above, it means that the person is normal and can eat anything without restriction. As for Hunan, Shandong, Sichuan, and Fujian, people are naturally fond of spicy food, which is due to local customs. These should be discussed separately.</p>
<h3>Hoarseness After a Cold</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zanchen</p>
<p>After a cold, the voice is hoarse and not clear. The reason is that the cold has not cleared, and the pathogenic heat lingers in the trachea, causing the lesion to spread to the larynx and vocal cords, causing inflammation. Therefore, although the cough has healed, the hoarseness is not easy to recover for a while. The treatment method is to use one or two egg whites, add a few scallions (including the white part), fry them together, and mix in a little maltose to take. The voice will gradually become clear. The nature of egg white is sweet and fishy, slightly cold and non-toxic. It can enter the lung meridian and treat swelling and pain of the throat and hoarseness. The Treatise on Cold Damage discusses sores in the throat and inability to make a sound, which is also the Jibaikejiu Fang (Egg White and Bitter Wine Decoction), which eliminates swelling and pain and produces sound. Adding maltose can quench thirst and moisten the lungs, and adding scallions can unblock the yang qi. The combination of the three can effectively eliminate inflammation and unblock congestion, and the vocal cords are moistened, so they can restore their original clarity. Moreover, the three items are daily food and ingredients, which seem insignificant, but taking them when one loses their voice has a special effect.</p>
<h3>Magic Congee for Dispelling Colds</h3>
<p>— Sun Zonghai</p>
<p>Since the beginning of winter, the weather has been very cold, and it is easy to suffer from colds and flu. This is because most of the houses and offices on the island are equipped with water radiators or stoves, which are as warm as spring. The climate indoors and outdoors is very different, and if you are not careful, you will easily suffer from this disease. Moreover, the houses on the isolated island are as narrow as pigeon lofts, and most families gather together. If one person gets sick, the whole family is infected, and both spirit and economy suffer. Now there is magic congee, which specializes in treating colds, flu, headaches, bone pain, and various epidemic diseases. The cooking method is simple and everyone can eat it. When you first get sick, taking this will solve it. Use half a cup of glutinous rice, five large slices of ginger, and two bowls of clear water, and boil them in a casserole for one or two rolls. Then add five or seven scallions with the roots, cook until the rice is cooked, then add a little pepper and mix well. Eat the congee while it is hot, or just eat the congee soup, and sleep in a windless place to sweat. This uses glutinous rice to support the righteousness as the monarch, and ginger and scallions to dispel as assistants, one to replenish and one to dispel, and also uses pepper to penetrate, which is very meaningful; and it has been repeatedly tested, which is by no means comparable to ordinary releasing agents. It is called magic congee, who says it is not appropriate?</p>
<h3>Cockle Shells</h3>
<p>— Zhang HuaiLin</p>
<p>"Cockle shells" are commonly known as Ma Hanqian, and those produced in Ningbo are the best. There are two types: the larger one is called Ma Han; the smaller one is called Ning Han. From autumn to spring, they are sold in the market. They are slightly cold in nature, and people with cold bodies should not eat them. People with weak digestive power should not eat them. However, they can calm the liver and nourish the blood, and are a food for women to soothe and nourish the liver. The meat is eaten during meals, and the shell is used for medicine and decocted after calcination. It is most suitable for people with yin deficiency and liver hyperactivity, who often have dizziness and tinnitus. Cockle shells nourish yin and blood. For those with liver yang exuberance, this thing can both subdue liver yang and nourish blood, which is very suitable.</p>
<p>Also, cockle shells are cold in nature, and people with deficiency and cold should not eat them. Eating them often causes abdominal pain, which is a sign of coldness. Women should also avoid eating them during menstruation.</p>

<h3>Bird's Nest (II)</h3>
<p>— Cao Bingzhang</p>
<p>Origin: Natural bird's nests are produced on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra in Southeast Asia. The Book of Yi states that on the coast, the rocky cliffs have many caves. Thousands of seabirds nest in the caves. There are no fewer than dozens of places such as Bantam, Batavia, Sambolong, Jielishi, Nanwang, Marcin, and Maoli Ba. They are all controlled by powerful Dutch people. Natural bird's nests are built on cliffs and precipices overseas, such as Siamese bird's nests and hairy bird's nests. Recently, in Java and other places in Southeast Asia, it is difficult to collect natural nests, so they have built houses to cultivate nesting, such as Dragon Tooth bird's nests and Dazhi bird's nests. Their color is white, tender, and loose in texture, because they are not exposed to sunlight. Borneo produces the most. Later, they were imported into our country from this place. According to statistics ten years ago, the annual import value was as much as 3.5 million taels of silver.</p>
<p>Morphology: The swiftlet is as big as a nightjar, shaped like a swallow, and smaller than an ordinary swallow. This is the morphology of the swiftlet. The bird's nest is the nest built by its saliva.</p>
<p>Efficacy: It is sweet, neutral, and non-toxic in taste. (Feng Yuan) It is sweet, bland, and neutral, greatly nourishes lung yin, resolves phlegm, stops cough, replenishes and clears, and is the holy medicine for treating deficiency and consumption. All diseases due to lung deficiency and inability to clear and descend can be treated with this. It opens the stomach qi, stops dysentery, benefits children's measles and varicella, can be added to decoctions, or taken alone in juice. (Tea Talk) It can stop frequent urination. (Physical Knowledge) It strengthens yang, benefits qi, harmonizes the middle, opens the stomach, adds essence, replenishes marrow, moistens the lungs, and stops chronic malaria, chronic diarrhea, and resolves consumptive phlegm. (Food Taboos) Red ones treat bloody dysentery. (Lingnan Miscellany) Remove the core of a white pear and put in one qian of bird's nest, first soak it in boiling water, then add one qian of rock sugar, steam it until cooked, and take it every morning without interruption. It has a miraculous effect in treating phlegm and asthma in the elderly. (Wentang Qi Yan Fang) Two qian of white bird's nest and four fen of ginseng, add ten parts of water, stew in a double boiler until cooked. Eat it slowly to treat anorexia with dysentery with immediate effect. (Saving the Suffering Seas) Two qian of bird's nest and one and a half qian of rock sugar, eat immediately. It treats malaria in the elderly and infantile malaria and fetal heat in children with prolonged malaria. (Trial Prescription) Persistent vomiting and anorexia, take it with milk and eat bird's nest to recover. (Wentang Collection of Prescriptions) Two qian of bird's nest and one and a half qian of raw astragalus, decoct into a thick juice and take it to treat insufficient qi and fluid in children and sunken pox. (Experience Prescription) Sudden cough, vomiting blood, take white bird's nest and rock sugar and cook together, take it continuously, take its mild tonifying lung and stomach, and there is no harm in stopping the problem, but those who have phlegm and dampness in the stomach, make people want to vomit, because of its sweetness and greasiness.

<h3>Changes in the Condition of Typhoid Fever and Dietary Regimen (Continued and Completed)</h3>
<p>— Chen Cunren</p>
<p>(C) Third Stage Symptoms: Alternating chills and fever do not subside, and the high and low temperatures seem to be regular. The temperature is in the range of 102-103 degrees Fahrenheit, the ears gradually become deaf, the eyes are slightly red, the mouth is slightly bitter, the throat is slightly dry, the eyes are slightly dizzy, there is discomfort in the chest and hypochondria, silence, disinclination to eat, restlessness.</p>
<p>In this period, in addition to the changes in the previous period, the symptoms are more common, but the prolonged alternating chills and fever make people anxious and uneasy. Seeing this phenomenon in typhoid fever, one must know that the disease will be prolonged. The diseases in the second and third stages of typhoid fever often occur in combination, and it is better if there is no loss of consciousness or fainting.</p>
<p>(D) Fourth Stage Symptoms: At this time, one gradually enters the state of decline, and the alternating chills and fever are still unresolved, with loose stools and diarrhea, abdominal fullness and vomiting, and hidden abdominal pain. This kind of phenomenon obviously shows that the physical strength is insufficient. It is also the commonly known "leaking the bottom of the bucket" typhoid fever.</p>
<p>(E) Fifth Stage Symptoms: The physical strength is extremely insufficient, drowsy, and only wants to sleep, the hands and feet are not very warm, the breath is exhaled from the mouth, and there is also diarrhea. At this time, if the diarrhea stops and the hands and feet warm, it is a good sign. Curled up and restless, wanting to take off the clothes, is also still curable. Sweating and dizziness are not good, and bleeding from diarrhea is likely to lead to death.</p>
<p>(F) Sixth Stage Symptoms: This is also the most terrible phenomenon, the tongue curls inward and is shorter than usual, the testicles and scrotum shrink and disappear, fainting, restlessness, vomiting and hiccups, even vomiting of roundworms, cold limbs, pale complexion, loose stools or hard stools that are black.</p>
<p>The changes in the condition of typhoid fever seem to have a certain process, as described above. If the treatment is appropriate, the disease often passes through one or two stages to three or four stages and is suddenly cured. The symptoms of stages five and six are rarely seen, so the mortality rate is less than 10%. The important thing is for the family to know the condition, resist for a long time, and not change the doctor's treatment plan early in the morning. The so-called "belief is power," and one must not doubt their physical strength or worry endlessly. The so-called "self-confidence can survive." Typhoid fever is often eliminated naturally through "long-term resistance." Therefore, "the final victory must belong to me." Even if the disease has become bone thin, but as long as the diet is properly nourished, it can easily change from thin to fat, and the physical strength is doubled compared to the past. Is it similar to the medical country doctor?</p>
<h3>The Issue of Dietary Restrictions</h3>
<p>— Qin Bingyi</p>
<p>National medicine has the theory of dietary restrictions. Because of this, gluttons think it is an unpleasant talk. One must know that dietary restrictions and diseases are indeed closely related. This journal advocates dietary therapy, and I am deeply sorry for the neglect of dietary restrictions by patients. Please allow me to discuss it in detail for everyone:</p>
<p>Food enters the mouth and all goes to Xiao. The stomach exercises its power to transform things, separating the dregs and taking the essence to nourish the blood vessels and replenish the internal organs. The stomach acts like this: how important is the relationship between food and the human body? It is natural for normal people, let alone patients? Furthermore, pure water changes quickly according to what is mixed with it. How can the response of food to the stomach and to the human body be outside of this? But ordinary people have strong digestive power, which does not cause drastic changes quickly. However, in the case of patients, things quickly become unmanageable! This is why dietary restrictions cannot be ignored. In general, external diseases require complete dietary restrictions, and even grains cannot be taken lightly; because grains help the stomach qi, and the external pathogenic heat is strong, more grains are easily attached, and the heat does not subside. As evidence, in the case of cholera after recovery, one must fast. As for internal injuries, the scope is wider: heart disease avoids roasted and spicy foods, liver disease avoids glutinous rice noodles and greasy foods, spleen disease avoids sticky and thick foods, lung disease avoids tobacco, alcohol, and stimulants, and kidney disease avoids shrimp, crabs, and irritating foods. These are obvious and more important. In addition, we must also pay attention to carbuncles, sores, and large illnesses that have not yet recovered. Otherwise, mild illnesses turn into serious illnesses, and serious illnesses turn into danger, which is inevitable and reasonable. In short, the matter of dietary restrictions, in the positive aspect, is to help the progress of medicine, and in the negative aspect, it is to prevent the expansion of the lesion. I hope the readers will examine it.</p>

<h3>School Overview: The Downtown Business School of Shanghai University</h3>

There were more than 200 students. Since then, it has gradually developed to what it is today, spanning seven years. Initially, it was planned to be named the Night University.

<h3>Li Huitang Agrees to Come North; Other Famous Hong Kong Players Will Come to Shanghai Together; Zhou Shoushen's Reply Arrives in Shanghai; Hong Kong Public Opinion Supports</h3>
<p>For the charity football match initiated by the International Relief Committee and the Refugee Association, in order to arouse the interest of all sectors and raise more funds to relieve refugees, Li Guiyong, a member of the Standing Committee, sent a special letter to Mr. Zhou Shoushen of Hong Kong, inviting Li Huitang, the captain and king of our World Games team, to come to Shanghai to participate. The International Committee received a reply from Zhou yesterday, saying that Li is very willing to come north to serve. According to the opinions of the sports circles and people from all walks of life in this city, it is hoped that Mr. Li can fulfill his promise to come here, and it is hoped that Hong Kong can send more famous players to join the Chinese team, so that the Western team can be severely defeated at that time. As for Mr. Li's concerns about public opinion, this event is purely for the refugees, so there is naturally no problem. The original letter from Zhou to the International Committee is recorded below: Mr. Guiyong, Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai International Relief Committee, Greetings. After receiving the letter sent on the 19th of last month, I immediately wrote to Mr. Li Huitang, inviting him to participate in the competition. I recently received his reply, saying that in the small team leader cup competition a few days ago, public opinion was critical at the time. His trip to Shanghai this time is similar in meaning. I don't know what public opinion is like. If the Chinese people all say it is okay to go, then he will not hesitate to go through fire and water. Now, looking at Mr. Huitang's words, his enthusiasm is overflowing. However, he is afraid that social people will misunderstand and blame him. Reading the newspapers in recent days, they all advocate his participation, which shows that public opinion is consistent. And Mr. Li has always followed public opinion as his guide, so his trip to Shanghai should be realized. However, I don't know when your committee has scheduled the charity football match, how many days the competition will last, how many days you need to stay in Shanghai, and how many players you need from Hong Kong. Please let me know the above information so that I can inform you. Zhou Shoushen bowed, etc.</p>

<h3>Securities: Domestic and Foreign Bonds Rise Steadily; Domestic Bonds Rise by 35 Cents; Foreign Bonds Rebound by 12 Pounds</h3>
<p>In the securities market, yesterday's gray market situation, while relatively stable, still appeared chaotic. According to reports, the new reform measures have become clear, namely that the sixth interest payment due can be divided into six installments and paid in legal tender in Shanghai. This is a considerable improvement compared to previous rumors, but in general, those holding physical bonds are still mostly apprehensive due to a lack of understanding of the true situation and are somewhat disappointed with the reforms. However, considering the overall financial situation of the country, the sincerity in safeguarding the interests of the people is felt to be very thorough and painstaking. The market price of public bonds, although inevitably slightly affected by sales from a few skeptics, is expected to calm down soon. Yesterday, at the opening in the morning, the "46" bond was quite heavily bought, and the market price suddenly rose by 67 cents. Subsequently, Xinfeng Water again had some selling, and the downward trend and fluctuations did not stop. However, retail selling was relatively less. Afternoon trading was relatively quiet, with some retail buying, but Xie Da still had some selling. In recent days, there have been many speculative transactions on both the buying and selling sides, so market fluctuations are not natural. The afternoon results were slightly better, and after the market closed for the whole day, it had risen slightly by 35 cents to 55 cents compared to the previous day. However, the "D" bond was traded very little, down slightly by 2 cents. The total transaction volume was about 560,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A　56.60　55.90　56.40　Up 0.55</p>
<p>Unified B　50.00　49.10　49.90　Up 0.50</p>
<p>Unified C　49.10　48.20　48.85　Up 0.55</p>
<p>Unified D　48.15　48.10　48.10　Down 0.20</p>
<p>Unified E　48.65　47.85　48.35　Up 0.35</p>
<p>96　7.00</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>7.00</p>
<p>Up 0.15</p>
<p>Stock trading was still dominated by public utility stocks. Yesterday, 300 shares of Zhabei Water and Electricity were traded at a price of 6.60 yuan, and 200 shares of China Merchants Electric were traded at a price of 4.95 yuan.</p>
<p>London Chinese foreign bonds on the 18th of this month (Wednesday) were listed. After two consecutive days of declines, various types of bonds have rebounded by 12 pounds or more. The Anglo-German continued loan and British bonds rose by 2 pounds, with a price of 72 pounds. The Reorganization Loan and British bonds rose by 1.5 pounds, with a price of 48 pounds. The Sino-French US dollar bonds with imprinted bonds and the Crisp bonds each rose by 1 pound, with the former priced at 67 pounds and the latter at 31 pounds. London still has supplies of the Sino-French Bonus and Reorganization British Gold bonds, but the owners are asking for very firm prices. The Sino-French US dollar bonds with imprinted bonds are priced at 68.5 pounds, 1.5 pounds above the market price. The Reorganization British Gold bonds and British bonds are priced at 48.5 pounds, half a pound above the market price. The French imprinted bonds are priced at 46 pounds and 5 shillings, 5 shillings higher than the previous day. The German imprinted bonds are priced at 44 pounds and 5 shillings, 15 shillings higher than the previous day.</p>
<p>Also, the stock market listing prices of various Far Eastern companies in London on the 18th of this month (Wednesday) were stable without change.</p>
<h3>Finance: Scarce Supply and Demand; Cash Price Remains Stable</h3>
<p>Yesterday's gray market for cash silver ingots was stable and consistent. The quietness of trading was unprecedented this year, mainly because major players were mostly holding a wait-and-see attitude. However, the market price, amidst the quietness, had slight ups and downs, generally starting flat, then falling, and then rebounding. Initially, a certain gold firm's interest was strong, but because the supply was not scarce, the supply and demand positions were balanced, and the market situation lacked change. Then, suddenly, after hearing that foreign exchange was heavily blocked by Hong Kong telegrams, it became slightly tight, and a certain money exchange business was eager to sell, so it once broke below the 20 yuan mark. Later, due to a certain gold firm suddenly buying, coupled with the lack of supply, it rebounded above the 20 yuan mark. In the end, there was no difference, and the sentiment of all parties was still stable. Silver jewelry shops did not see any changes. Customs Gold, Fengzhong British Pure Gold, etc., fell slightly again.</p>
<p>Major Ingot Traders Observe and Do Not Move</p>
<p>From the morning, there was no trading for each bar (ten taels). It was not until 9:50 that a certain gold firm bought 50 taels each from the money exchange business and the cash firm, with an opening price of 2003 yuan (the buyer made up for what they had sold the previous day). After this, because the buyers heard that foreign exchange was slightly tight after being heavily blocked by Hong Kong telegrams, they mostly observed cautiously, making it even more difficult to trade. The price then retreated to between 20 yuan. Later, until about 10:45, because a certain money exchange business was eager to sell, it depreciated and sold 50 taels to the silver jewelry industry at a low price of 17 yuan. Later, it was extended to 11:15, and another 50 taels were sold by the money exchange business to the silver jewelry industry at a noon closing price of 19 yuan. In the afternoon, trading became even quieter. Only at 2:30, the silver jewelry industry sold 50 taels to the gold firm at a price of 22 yuan. After this, a certain firm suddenly had the intention to sell and shouted as low as 20 yuan, but it was difficult to find buyers, so no trading was done. Therefore, the evening closing price was 2022 yuan, with no difference from the previous day's evening closing price. The total range for the day was 6 yuan. The selling price of the cash firm's own gold brand was 2030 yuan, and the buying price was 2015 yuan. The current standard gold was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there was no trading.</p>
<p>Silver Jewelry Still Held at Original Price</p>
<p>The exchange rate for silver jewelry per tael did not change. Da Tong Heng, Lao Qingyun, etc., still held the original price of 205 yuan, and Xin Tong Heng still held 203 yuan, with a buying price of 197 yuan.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Continues to Shrink by One Penny</p>
<p>An 18th London telegram stated that British pure gold shrunk by another penny per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 7 pence and 7 and a half farthings. The central bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold ingots also decreased to 1213.3 yuan. The listed Customs Gold also decreased by 2 li, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen and 7 li. The Shanghai listed standard gold price also fell by 7 jiao, totaling 1208.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Trading is Low; Prices Also Gradually Decrease</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold fell by one penny, and the British-American exchange rate rose by 0.25. The demand for foreign exchange was slightly strong, and the supply was not smooth. The process was stable, and the trend was weak. Ingot trading was not strong, major players were watching, and retail investors slightly emerged to settle. Speculators were uncertain, and the market price hovered and tended to soften. Foreign currency trading was very scarce. The demand for British gold pounds was very strong, and foreign banks collected more than 100 pounds. Dutch bills and Philippine bills were scarce on the market, and the prices were slightly higher. Other currencies showed a slight decrease. The process was calm, and the trend was slightly soft. The guild did not start trading. Yesterday's market prices: US dollar bill price was down 1 fen, Hong Kong bill was down 3 li, Singapore bill was down 1 fen, Dutch bill was up 3 fen, Philippine bill was up 2 fen, Italian bill was down 1 fen. Other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Prices Decrease Again</h3>
<p>An 18th London telegram stated that speculators sold, there was a lack of maintenance, and trading was limited. The silver market was still flat, and after the close, it was flat and dull. Finally, there were a few transactions, and the buyers were satisfied. The near and far terms of large silver bars continued to decrease, with the near term shrinking by 0.1875 and the far term shrinking by 0.125. A New York silver telegram stated that the US silver price still had a market but no sales. Another Bombay silver telegram stated that the Indian silver market was still flat, and the spot price had not changed. Near and far terms both continued to fall by one anna.</p>
<h3>Spot Discount Gradually Increases</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange bills and notes was still gradually increasing. Initially, it was 37 yuan per thousand, and at noon, it rose slightly to 37.25 yuan. In the afternoon, it continued to climb slightly to 37.75 yuan, and finally, it was 37.5 yuan, half a yuan higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Continuously Sells Foreign Exchange; Exchange Rate Continues to Rise, British Flat, US Loosens</h3>
<p>Although foreign firms still have frequent settlements in the foreign exchange market yesterday, the situation is gradually stabilizing because Hong Kong telegrams continue to sell vigorously, and Chinese speculators are also emerging. However, when squeezed, the British are flat and the US loosens, which is because the British-American exchange rate is squeezed long.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London large bars continued to shrink near and far, and New York spot prices did not move. London raw gold fell by one penny, and the exchange rate of British to American continued to rise by 5 li 6, did not change to French, and was still flat to Shanghai. American to British rose by 0.25 again, rose by 0.375 to French, and remained the same to Shanghai. The central listing prices for various exchanges remained unchanged. Banks opened early spot selling prices: British exchange was 8 pence 296875, and American exchange was 16.1875 yuan. Compared with the previous close, British shrunk by 0.015625, and American had no ups and downs. After opening, although Datong, British, Dutch, and American banks competed to buy spot American exchange at 16.12875 yuan, and HSBC Magali purchased spot shillings at 8 pence 3125, the potential was slightly tighter because Hong Kong telegrams repeatedly exerted pressure, and Chinese banks also started selling favorable January shillings also at 8 pence 3125. HSBC's listing price was revealed and did not move. The silver balancing tax was revealed and continued to shrink by 0.125. After that, foreign firms bought HSBC Magali spot shillings at only 8 pence 28125, and also bought and settled Dutch Datong spot American exchange at only 16.1875 yuan. In addition, Huayi, Anda, and Holland competed to absorb spot Hong Kong exchange from money exchange businesses at 55.75 yuan, so the situation gradually turned flat. The noon closing prices were British gold at 8 pence 3125 and US dollars at 16.21875 yuan.</p>
<p>In the later market, although Huabi American Bank Datong Holland's appetite was still healthy, and they continued to buy spot shillings at 8 pence 3125 and spot American exchange at 16.21875 yuan, the situation tended to loosen because Hong Kong telegrams' selling intention never weakened. Finally, foreign firms bought spot shillings from British Bank again at 8 pence 25. In addition, the supply of funds from banks was not smooth, and the appetite was healthier. Huabi Holland bought spot Hong Kong exchange at 55.75 yuan, causing the trend to return to stability. The evening closing selling prices of banks were British exchange at 8 pence 325 and US exchange at 16.21875 yuan. As a result, compared with the previous close, British was flat and US rose by 0.03125. Hong Kong exchange shrank by 0.25 compared with the previous day's transaction price.</p>
<h3>Silver and Money Businesses Make a Fortune: Thanks to the Government and the Blessings of Clients Fleeing Disaster; It's Really a Huge Wartime Profits Tax</h3>
<p>In 1938, HSBC Bank made a great fortune, and other banks, such as Huabi, also made a fortune. Not only did foreign banks make a fortune, but also Chinese banks, without exception. Not only did Chinese banks make a fortune, but also money shops, even the small money shops in the Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road areas, all made a fortune, some with tens of millions or hundreds of thousands of yuan, and others with tens of thousands of yuan. Bank managers and directors all laughed, while bank employees had tears and laughter, and some were unable to cry or laugh. Employees in foreign banks had monthly surpluses and could receive foreign exchange, thanks to the foreign bosses and, in fact, thanks to the government, so everyone smiled. Chinese bank employees initially used the national crisis as a pretext to lay off employees and reduce salaries, with discounts of 30% or 20%, and everyone felt pain. However, some were favored by the bank authorities and secretly received allowances. Those who ate meat ate meat, and those who ate bones ate bones. The bitterness and joy were uneven, and there were also many who were unable to cry or laugh.</p>
<p>Where did this rolling legal tender come from? (1) It was foreign exchange. The words "foreign exchange" were the shortcut for banks to make a fortune. As long as the statutory exchange rate and the black market exchange rate were compared, it would be clear, not to mention "getting the wind first" and buying and selling at any time. (2) Restricting withdrawals and promoting remittances, the original intention was to maintain finance, but unexpectedly, it became a way to make money. Buying and selling legal tender and discounting at exorbitant rates, the profits in this were immeasurable. (3) Real estate transactions, due to the concentration of refugees in Shanghai, suddenly became active. For example, one bank completed 6 million yuan in this transaction in one month in June, and the others can be imagined. (4) Buying and selling gold. Last year, the trend was upward, and every transaction made a profit. Just buy and just sell. In and out, a bar of gold did not talk about surplus, but only the handling fee was already more than ten yuan. (5) Those who did remittances in the north, such as Tianjin, were given a great opportunity for profit due to the difference between "counterfeit money" and legal tender. (6) Deposits increased sharply. Last year, the refugees who fled to Shanghai were mostly wealthy people from the mainland, who came with huge sums of money and all used banks as a place to store them. On the one hand, due to the sharp increase in population, the market was abnormally prosperous, and banks used this to make payments and use capital, benefiting from the situation.</p>
<p>So, banks and money shops made a fortune. Where did the money come from? Who did they rely on? The government's maintenance of the statutory exchange rate and the assistance of customers who came and went. How much benefit was there for the country? Only a wartime profits tax, but it needs to be fair and collected according to the amount. However, it will again use wartime losses as a trick to cover the books in order to escape it.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Hoarding Intensifies; Yarn Prices Rise Again by 67 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market is increasingly firm, and the rising trend is particularly strong. Although actual demand does not have wholesale development, it is more than the previous day, and various groups show signs of activity. The Yunnan group continues to purchase, and the Jiangxi group's buying appetite is particularly strong, making the market even more upright. As for the Tonghui and hoarders, their intentions are originally to watch for higher prices. With this actual sales support, their absorption in the market is doubly strong. Therefore, the market price is moving forward vigorously. According to the reporter's repeated investigations, why is hoarding cotton yarn so enthusiastic among those who are generally economically prosperous? According to public opinion, (1) the raw materials are monopolized by a certain party, and there is no hope of a decline in the future. The raw cotton for spinning 20s yarn must be priced at 80 yuan per dan (horse scale). Three and a half dan make one package of yarn, and the cost is 280 yuan. Adding various opening fees and other miscellaneous expenses of 50 yuan, plus a unified tax of 10 yuan, the net price is a total of 340 yuan. At the current yarn price of 390 yuan, there is only a profit of more than 40 yuan. (2) The securities market is erratic. Many people who release public bonds and invest in cotton yarn. With these two major reasons, the market remains firm and does not loosen. The future is that we will continue to move forward and break through the high price of 403 yuan, still relying on sales to drive it.</p>
<p>Looking at the situation of the current yarn market yesterday, the market opened in the early morning due to news of activity in the demand of customer groups. The Yunnan group had a telegram to purchase goods, and the activity of hoarders became even stronger. The opening price of 20s Double Horse jumped by 8.5 yuan to 393.5 yuan. Fellow traders transacted 30 bales. Shortly after, the Shantou group also came to purchase 20 bales, adding another 0.5 yuan, and the atmosphere was tight. After the price was high, some profit-takers took advantage of the rise to sell, but major players still absorbed, and there was a slight pullback. Double Horse was transacted at 391 yuan. Then, the industry continued to buy, and the price rose again. The closing price of 10s Double Horse was 392 yuan. As a result, 1427 bales were transacted in the morning. The Double Horse price rose by 7 yuan, the Special Jincheng rose by 7 yuan, the Double Earth rose by 6 yuan, the Tiannv rose by 6 yuan, and the 10s coarse yarn rose by 3 yuan. The Yong'an Factory opened 50 bales of 20s Jincheng at a price of 397 yuan. The Hongzhang Factory opened 200 bales of 10s Shi Yi at a price of 285 yuan. The Dasheng Factory opened 100 bales of 10s Hong Kuixing, priced from 277 yuan to 275 yuan. In the afternoon, it was reported that the Tongyi Factory opened 20s Jinji at 393 yuan and 10s Jinji at 302 yuan, totaling more than 200 bales, which were purchased by Yunnan. The amount purchased by each group is recorded below:</p>
<p>Fellow Traders　987　Jiangxi　230</p>
<p>Yunnan　125　Mainland　90</p>
<p>Fuzhou　15　Shantou　20</p>
<p>Total　1,427</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is following the rise of Chinese yarn, but demand is still not smooth. The ball trading this month is relatively popular. The current spot price of 20s Shuiyue yarn is 314 yuan. The price for this month is 3123 yuan. 20s Lanfeng is 311 yuan, and this month is 310 yuan to 308.5 yuan, up 2.3 yuan or more from the previous day. 42s and 32s have particularly tight momentum.</p>
<h3>Sales of Fine Velvet Rise Sharply; White Bales Sell at High Prices</h3>
<p>The cotton business has become more prosperous. The Tianjin fine velvet cotton, which had been sluggish for a long time, suddenly launched yesterday. However, the amount is scarce, and it is purchased by the Hua number to offset the factory quota that has been dumped. The Japanese factory is still purchasing 700 pieces of Indian cotton, which is the raw material for 32s, at a price of only 88 yuan. China Merchants Yong'an purchased 200 pieces of bundled cotton, and Tongyi Factory purchased 1,000 bales of Yao clothing. The remaining factories are still as depressed as before. However, the industry's entry and exit are still lively, and the market is calm. There is not much difference from the previous day. Only the selling price of white bales is still outstanding. From the overall trend of the cotton market, the price has reached a point where it cannot rise any further. However, the source of the northern route has disappeared, so the purchase of American and Indian cotton by various factories in China and abroad has increased rather than decreased. There are 1,500 bales of Tonghua and fine velvet arriving at the pier, 390 pieces from Xingang, and 250 pieces from Beisha, which have not yet been opened. The current cotton transaction amount and market conditions are listed on the left:</p>
<h3>Difficult to Resolve American Cotton Production; Intention to Convene World Cotton Production Conference; American Cotton Market Prices Therefore Stagnate</h3>
<p>The foreign cotton market prices, the National Assembly held in Washington and the meeting of cotton producing area congressmen held since the previous day, are particularly concerned by people in the world cotton industry. The meeting of cotton producing area congressmen is due to the severity of the cotton surplus problem, which is not easy to solve, so the meeting has been temporarily suspended since yesterday and will be continued after a few days. American Agriculture Secretary Henry Wells, seeing that the American cotton surplus problem cannot be solved by the American government alone, is now planning to try to convene an international cotton production conference of various cotton producing countries in the world to jointly discuss how to deal with this surplus of loan cotton and future cotton industry policies and other issues. Recently, cloth is still selling well, with a total of more than 6 million yards sold in the past two days, so the entry appetite of various factories has been unusually strong recently. However, the congressional discussions have not yet been resolved, and the market price is therefore very stagnant. Yesterday, New York saw mixed ups and downs. India, including forecasts, fell by half a 比, and Egypt rose by 35 pounds. Yesterday, the exchange rate was firm, and the legal tender cotton prices all fell. American cotton and Brazilian cotton each fell by 0.7 yuan per dan, Egyptian fell by 0.9 yuan, and Indian cotton fell by 0.3 yuan.</p>
<p>The trading of foreign cotton in this city is due to the high price of fire machines and the scarcity of sources, and the amount of bales cannot be large, so various factories have been opening a lot of Pingguo'er Omarra for days. Yesterday, Shenxinfu entered 700 bales of Indian cotton Bairok, which can be spun into 32s, and the factory price was 88.25 yuan. The transaction amount is recorded below:</p>
<p>Shenxin　Entered Indian Cotton　700 bales</p>
<p>Tongxing　Also　500 bales</p>
<p>Gongda　Also　500 bales</p>
<p>Neiwai　Entered American Cotton　1,000 bales</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: East Piece Rising Trend Becomes More Intense; Speculation Rises Suddenly and Goods are Hoarded; Market Prices Rise Steadily and Additional Purchases Continue</h3>
<p>National Cloth: Yesterday, the rising trend of East Pieces intensified, and the prices of Hua Factory greige also rose, affecting the cost of dyed cloth, and the selling prices were uniformly raised. The atmosphere was upward, and the demand appetite was more intense. Distant and nearby customers continued to add orders. The Ningbo group and eastern Zhejiang inland original pieces and white cloth dismantled pieces shipped out more than 500 pieces yesterday. The Ou group and the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway also reached more than 400 pieces, mostly blue cloth, miscellaneous twill, and native cloth. The purchase of printed goods, bleached cloth, greige, was also large. The Sichuan-Yunnan group also made progress, purchasing more than 100 pieces of innerwear factory 9-pound coarse cloth, 84 greige, Peacock fine cloth, etc., and more than 3,000 pieces of bleached cloth, blue cloth, colored twill, poplin, and printed goods. The Haikou group entered 30 boxes of colored twill and 30 bales of fine twill. The Hong Kong group entered more than 40 bales of 12-pound three rabbit coarse twill, 16-pound coarse twill, 9-pound coarse cloth, and fine twill. The Yangkou, Shaxian, Xinghua, Quanzhou and other places in Fujian Province entered thousands of pieces of original color miscellaneous color twill serge. The Shantou group entered more than 200 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, colored cloth, and bleached cloth. The selling price of printed, dyed, and bleached cloth rose by 0.1 to 0.3 yuan per piece. Only 84 cloth rose by 0.1 yuan for white goods. The prices of coarse and fine cloth and coarse and fine twill are still flat, and the trend has been slightly active. White goods continue to be outstanding.</p>
<p>East Cloth:</p>
<p>Sales are becoming increasingly prosperous. Yesterday, the selling prices of fine cloth and fine twill rose steadily. For example, the closing price of fine cloth from the Dragon Head and Color Ball brands was 11.4 yuan per piece, and the market price was still 0.1 yuan higher per piece. The total number of current and futures orders for Dragon Head, Color Ball, Flying Fish, Trumpet, Double Fish, and other fine cloths was about 2,000 pieces. In addition, there were also 4500 pieces of Yanghe, Dragon Head, and Baby fine twill opened. Although this was due to the high spirits of fellow traders and their strong entry appetite, there were also some non-industry hoarders who, in view of the active trend of East Pieces and the convenience of entry and exit, were not without speculators. Therefore, in addition to the sale of futures by various foreign firms, the spot trading in the market was also very lively. The local dyeing and sales and mutual sales among fellow traders also amounted to 1,500600 pieces. The Tianjin group's entry intention was even better, and they continued to purchase more than 1,000 pieces of fine cloth and fine twill from various brands. The factories were tightening their prices, hoarding goods to make a profit. The original cloth of 84 Flying Fish and other brands also increased by 0.10.2 yuan yesterday. For transportation and export, 454 pieces of Chinese and foreign piece goods were transported to Tianjin yesterday.</p>
<h3>Food: Imported Wheat Arrives in Shanghai; Flour Becomes Mutually Exclusive; Wheat Shows Signs of Collapse</h3>
<p>The current sales of flour decreased yesterday, and both the northern and southern groups had not yet cleared the goods they had previously purchased. Moreover, after the factory's fixed wheat arrived in Shanghai, the raw materials gradually became sufficient, and buyers were thinking of suppressing prices to purchase, while the factories were thinking of holding on to the original prices, but they were not too accommodating, resulting in mutual exclusion between the two parties. As a result, in addition to the 7,000 or more bags of No. 2 flour of various brands that were punched out at the original price by the local street, the remaining customers only had 2300 bags and 12,000 bags of scattered decorative transactions. There were rumors that the selling price of returned goods was revised downward, so the market has shown signs of secret loosening. As for the current flour export, there were 21,000 bags transported to Tianjin yesterday, and there will also be 1,000 bags transported to Tianjin and 7,000 bags transported to Yantai today.</p>
<p>The wheat market showed signs of collapse yesterday. The source of cartwheel wheat was about 2,000 bags each, including 1,200 bags from Xingang. The factory's orders for foreign wheat are arriving one after another. Although it still needs domestic wheat, the eating plate has been given importance. The cargo side is still struggling because of the difficulty of transportation and high costs. As a result, it has been reduced by 0.030.04 yuan. A total of 5,000 bags of Jiangbei, Puzhen, Wuhu, and other wheat were opened. Fuxin Factory purchased 3,000 bags, and Fulan Factory purchased 2,000 bags, with a highest price of 6.67 yuan. With the sound of foreign wheat arriving in Shanghai, the future of domestic wheat has been significantly affected.</p>
<h3>Keqian Cartwheel Arrived with a Thriving Source; Jingmi People are also Discouraged</h3>
<p>Ke Qian: Some local customers took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the market was quite prosperous. However, cartwheel arrivals were all surging. In addition to Jingwu Zhenjiang Keqian, there were also 1,500 bags from Hupu and 3,000 bags of Taizhou Jiqian newly arrived. Therefore, the Chinese goods continued to shrink by nearly jiao, and the high-end goods also had a soft count of several fen. Nanjing high-end Keqian shouted 11 yuan, but the market only opened 10.09 yuan. Although the newly arrived Taizhou cargo products were better than the previous arrivals, the market price was only 10.03 yuan. Zhenjiang Qian was 10.08 yuan, and Wu Qian was 10.065 yuan to about 10 yuan. A total of more than 2,000 bags were transacted in the unified market.</p>
<p>Jingmi: The source of Heda has not arrived, but there are quite a few wheel carts and buns, totaling more than 10,000 bags. However, many of those who suffered rain damage on the way in the past two days were not few. The sellers could not help but be discouraged and all held the intention of quick release. Moreover, the street and hoarders saw that the source was slightly more, and their thoughts were also set, so the market conditions were very different from the previous market, and the situation suddenly softened. The market immediately went down. As a result, thick and thin Jingxi were all down by a small angle. Du Yangjian Pu Jian was also difficult to stand firm, falling by several fen to one jiao. Only Bian Yuan's scarce hot orders were still firm.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous: Jute Bags are in Short Supply; Selling Prices are Rising Daily</h3>
<p>The jute bags needed for sugar, rice, and miscellaneous grains in this city have always relied on imports from India. Due to the tightening of exchange rates, the source has gradually decreased. There is only one Japanese company with a relatively large scale of bag-making factories in this port, but it must supply military needs for that country. The old bags in the market have been purchased in large quantities by the Chinese and Japanese armies successively, so merchants often feel that the need is insufficient. At present, the selling price of large market goods of blue line single Mai is 750 yuan per thousand, and single Mai Chongxin needs 850 yuan per thousand, which is very different from the 4500 yuan per thousand before August 13.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Mingfu a Batch; Newly Purchased by Hong Kong Gang</h3>
<p>Mingfu: Due to the lack of both arrival and storage, the way out is smooth. It is heard that a batch of fathers were installed in the Asia Rounds this issue, which was purchased by the Hong Kong Gang, so the market situation is expensive. For example, the upper village of Zhoushanfu needs 68 yuan to 65 yuan, Ningbofu ordinary 33 yuan, new goods 345 yuan, Shandong goods 48 yuan to 50 yuan, up 35 yuan or more each compared with the previous one.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Sesame is Expensive and Charming; It is Sold as Soon as it Arrives</h3>
<p>The sesame dark plate market is still outstanding. Because the transportation is difficult, the source is decreasing day by day, the bottom accumulation is empty, it is sold as soon as it arrives, and the market conditions are straight up to Qingyun. Yesterday, it was heard that the foreign village's net goods sesame would open to 21.5 yuan, because there was no supply of goods, the rising energy was very fierce.</p>
<h3>Medicines Sparse Sales for Premium Almonds</h3>
<p>Premium almonds come from Qingdao. Their sales, primarily to pharmacies, have been sparse recently. The market is sluggish. Previously, the price was 80 yuan per dan (a unit of weight). Yesterday, a certain firm offered them at 75 yuan, a decrease of 5 yuan compared to the previous price.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Silk Price Increase Slower Than Dry Cocoons</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the silk market, overseas markets were firm. The morning markets in New York and Yokohama were slightly lower than the previous day. New York spot prices fell by one cent, and forward prices by half a cent. Yokohama spot prices decreased by four yuan, and forward prices by two yuan. However, by the afternoon, Yokohama's closing price soared by approximately 10-12 yuan. Local trading was brisk. White filature silk reached a new high price of 78 fen but was not yet offered, as the eastern market's surge caused Shanghai's improved dry cocoons to jump by 20 yuan (320-330 yuan). Based on this calculation, the white filature silk market should have risen by 80 yuan (calculated based on a reeling yield of 400 catties), but the rate of increase in the silk market did not reach this level. Therefore, white filature silk trading temporarily stalled. Only high-grade, fine-strand filature silk had a market with British firms, with prices being very expensive. Seven-star grade sold for 1530 yuan, which is an example. Other American and Indian Chappah silks have been very active recently, and prices have also increased by 10-20 yuan. A total of 50 dan were traded yesterday.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 100 barrels of silk waste were shipped to Italy.</p>
<h3>Import and Export Diesel and Candles Shipped to Beiyang</h3>
<p>Today, 400 cases of diesel oil were shipped to Weihaiwei, and 2,000 cases of white wax and 2,000 boxes of candles were shipped to Tianjin. Also, yesterday, 1,000 pieces of native paper were shipped to Tianjin, and 100 barrels of tung oil were shipped to Italy. Additionally, today, 11,000 pieces of native paper are being shipped to Qingdao.</p>
<h3>Metals Customer Sales Show Renewed Activity</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the metals market, due to the Fuzhou, Wenzhou, Tianjin, and Qingdao communities purchasing goods for the New Year, trading showed renewed activity. Openings for various iron products reached more than 3,400 dan, with new galvanized iron wire, white galvanized iron wire, yellow steel wire, local factory nails, and Huisi iron being the most abundant. The market was very firm due to the tightening foreign exchange rate. New galvanized iron wire was priced at 18.5 yuan, white galvanized iron wire at 16 yuan, yellow steel wire at 19 yuan, local factory nails at 16.25 yuan, and Huisi iron at 55 yuan. Other items such as British steel plates, angle iron, electrical wire, and black iron nails also had openings, with no major changes in prices. Trading on this street remained peaceful yesterday, with openings for over 1,000 dan of various goods, with tinplate being the most abundant.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Taikoo Refined White Sugar is Indeed Tight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was stable. The association's benchmark price for current stock of No. 24 Dutch coarse white sugar was 24.6 yuan, with some even quoting 24.65 yuan. Local warehouse sugar was 24.8 yuan, Big Golden Coin brand was 25 yuan, re-export sugar was 16.5 yuan, current stock of Dutch red sugar was 16.6 yuan, re-export sugar was 11 yuan. Taikoo refined white B mark sugar from the Western warehouse was 23.95 yuan, and from the Eastern warehouse was 23.95 yuan. CW mark was 23.7 yuan, CX mark was 23.65 yuan, DY mark was 23.6 yuan, and HX mark was 23.5 yuan. The market is expected to tighten. Chaozhou brokers opened with high-quality Huanggang Qing at 13.12 yuan, totaling two hundred and several tens of packages. Over six hundred packages of old refined red sugar were priced at 15.05-15.1 yuan, and odd white sugar was quoted at 18.5 yuan, with high-tech foreign sugar at 16.5 yuan. Guangdong-Hong Kong brokers opened with over seven hundred packages of Hainan red sugar at 11.9 yuan, and over a hundred boxes of high-quality slab Qing at 11.8 yuan. Jian brokers opened with several tens of packages of miscellaneous roadside white sugar at 21.9 yuan, and Da Gong powder was quoted at 22.5 yuan, and tribute red sugar at 15.1 yuan, but no deals were made.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods Tong'an Dried Longan Increases by Another Yuan</h3>
<p>Tong'an sun-dried longan, the dozens of boxes that arrived previously, due to customer insistence on a price increase, were held up for a long time. Yesterday, it was heard that a deal had been reached, with an increase of one yuan compared to the previous price. The goods were distributed to various firms proportionally. It was also heard that production prices remain tight, and the market may rise again in the future.</p>
<h3>New Tangerine Peel Candies Market Appears Weak</h3>
<p>Xiamen Dou New Tangerine Peel Candies, imported via Taikoo Company's Xinjiang ship, continue to arrive in dozens of barrels. Samples were seen yesterday, with excellent color and size, and the candy base is also very soft and glutinous. However, due to recent slow sales, there are signs of slight weakness.</p>
<p>Previously, 300 packages of dates were imported from Tianjin, and 7,230 packages of shelled peanuts and 600 packages of peanuts were imported from Weihaiwei.</p>

<h3>Municipal Party Department and Various Organizations Congratulate the Fifth Plenary Session and Request the Arrest and Prosecution of Wang Jingwei to Warn Traitors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department and various leading organizations in the city jointly sent a telegram to the Central Government yesterday to congratulate the opening of the plenary session. They also stated that Wang Jingwei's collusion with the enemy and advocacy of surrender should be subject to arrest and prosecution to warn traitors. The original telegram read: To Chiang Kai-shek, President of the Kuomintang of China, and the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive and Supervisory Committees: The grand meeting has begun, and all the talented individuals are present. New strategies for resisting Japan and expelling the Japanese invaders have been determined, and nation-building strategies to revitalize our nation have been decided. We are deeply gratified and congratulate you. However, at a time when the war of resistance is entering a new phase, Wang Jingwei dared to collude with the enemy and advocate surrender. His intentions are not only to shake people's hearts but also to undermine the foundation of the nation. Our Central Government, with its magnanimous heart, only gave him the punishment of expulsion from the party and removal from his post, hoping that he would repent and start anew. However, he hid in a foreign land and continued to publish absurd theories, which are truly unforgivable. We request that the meeting issue a clear order for his arrest and prosecution to warn traitors and rectify discipline. We send our thoughts via telegram and pray without end. Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department and various leading organizations in Shanghai respectfully send their regards.</p>
<h3>London Chinese Bonds Rebound Japan Bonds Plummet</h3>
<p>According to a reliable source from British merchants in this city, when the London Stock Exchange opened this Monday (the 16th), due to the Chinese government's announcement that Japan had seized tariffs in the guerrilla areas and stopped overdrafts from the Central Bank, bonds secured by tariffs fell by as much as 5 to 1.5 pounds. However, bondholders holding Chinese bonds in the market firmly believed that China's economic foundation was solid and that the war situation was improving, so no one sold them off. British merchants received a telegram from England again yesterday morning. There were no ups and downs in the market this Tuesday (the 17th), and no transactions. By yesterday (the 18th), it finally rebounded. The Anglo-German 4.5% loan (issued by Britain) soared by 2 pounds, and the Post-Reorganization 5% public bond rebounded by 1.5 pounds. As for Japanese bonds, after falling by 1.5 pounds this Monday, they did not rebound at all in the past two days. This is enough to prove that although this countermeasure of the Chinese government suffered a temporary reaction, it is actually more beneficial to the entire national economy of China.</p>

<h3>US Fleet Commander Inspects the Yangtze River Significant Implications Perhaps Related to the Opening of the Yangtze River Japanese Side Unwilling to Have US Ships Sail to Hankou</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that the Commander of the United States Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Yarnell, and the US Consul General in Shanghai, Gauss, left Shanghai at 8:30 AM yesterday morning (the 18th) to inspect the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. They traveled on Admiral Yarnell's private yacht, the Isabel. If their plans do not change midway, they are expected to travel as far as Wuhu. They are expected to return to Shanghai in the afternoon of the 22nd or the morning of the 23rd. Before leaving Shanghai yesterday, Admiral Yarnell and Consul General Gauss rarely mentioned the purpose of this trip but strongly stated that the trip had no political significance. Although there has been no official explanation, observers in this city believe that this trip must have some important political implications. This can be seen from the fact that all plans for this trip were carried out in an atmosphere of secrecy. Some observers believe that their trip may be related to breaking the current blockade of the Yangtze River and believe that American residents in Wuhu are often obstructed by the Japanese. They may investigate this matter. Also, a news report stated that a Japanese spokesperson said yesterday that the US Asiatic Fleet Commander Yarnell and the US Consul General in Shanghai Gauss's decision to inspect the situation on the Yangtze River, if they want to go upstream from Wuhu to Hankou, the Japanese naval authorities have decided to refuse to send warships to escort them. However, it is still unknown whether Yarnell and his party intend to go directly to Wuhan. Furthermore, when the USS Luzon returned to Shanghai from Hankou last time, it was escorted by Japanese warships along the way. Officials from the USS Luzon told reporters in detail that Japanese warships fired aimlessly at both sides of the Yangtze River along the way, the purpose of which was to deceive the Americans into thinking that navigation on the Yangtze River was still unsafe. The Japanese side has protested to the US side about this matter.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Determined to Maintain Credit This Announcement is Actually in Line with Common Sense Uniform and Reconstruction Bonds Paid in Full as Usual</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance is determined to maintain credit, and the National Debt Fund Management Committee will continue to conduct lotteries for principal repayment as usual. The Uniform bonds due at the end of this month and the Reconstruction bonds due at the end of February will be paid in full in Chongqing. This announcement that tariff-secured debts will no longer be overdrafted is actually in line with common sense. The Shanghai bond market has stabilized. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Government Determined to Maintain Credit</p>
<p>Although our government is under extremely strained wartime finances, it has always maintained its credit. Therefore, the market prices of domestic and foreign debts have remained very firm over the years. Since the Ministry of Finance announced that customs duties securing various debts would no longer be overdrafted, the market has misunderstood, and there has been a sharp reaction in foreign exchange, the bond market, the gold market, and cotton yarn. The sharp rise in foreign exchange and gold prices this Monday shows the market's false alarm. The government has always fulfilled its debt repayments on time. In the past, although tax revenues were occasionally short due to natural disasters, man-made disasters, and economic panic, the government would definitely transfer huge amounts of funds to repay them on time. The amount of overdrafts from the Central Bank reached as high as 175 million yuan, which shows the soundness of the government's financial policy and its determination to maintain credit.</p>
<p>Tax Revenue Seized Stop Overdrafting</p>
<p>In the past year, customs revenue has not decreased by much, and there has been dedicated funding that has not been remitted. The government has still generously allowed overdrafting, and its consideration for maintaining credit has exceeded the general circumstances. This, compared with the Japanese side's seizure of tax revenue, shows the greatness of the government's attitude. Bonds that already have dedicated funding are different from those that are secured but have insufficient revenue. There are even huge amounts of dedicated funding accumulated due to guarantees. Therefore, the government's recent suspension of overdrafting is actually in line with common sense. Since the customs agreement published by both Britain and Japan, the transfer of tax revenue to the Japanese side, our government has protested to Britain, which has caused the current lack of funds for some debt interest. People in China and abroad should also be aware of this and know where the responsibility lies.</p>
<p>Domestic Public Bonds Lottery for Principal Repayment</p>
<p>The government's response to this situation is very appropriate. In addition to announcing that customs duties securing various debts will no longer be overdrafted, it also declared that for all long-term debts secured by customs duties that were borrowed before the war but have not yet been repaid, the government will allocate funds from the customs revenue outside the war zone in proportion to the amounts due and deposit them in the Central Bank for dedicated use. It also stated that when customs stations in the war zone remit the arrears of allocated debt repayments in the future, they should still allocate funds for debt repayment. It can also be seen that the government maintains its credit attitude. The National Debt Fund Management Committee will continue to hold lotteries for principal repayment of domestic debts as usual. The public bonds that should be drawn on February 10 are Class A bonds of the Uniform Public Bond.</p>
<p>Uniform and Reconstruction Bonds Paid in Full</p>
<p>The Central Bank has received an order from the head office to allow the full payment of principal and interest of the five types of Uniform Public Bonds A, B, C, D, and E due on January 31 and the Reconstruction Public Bonds due on February 28 in Chongqing. However, in order to facilitate bondholders in Shanghai, the Shanghai branches of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the Central Trust Bureau are specially authorized to handle payments on behalf of the Central Bank, but payments will be made in six installments, with each installment lasting one month. The detailed rules for installment payments in Shanghai have been promulgated. It is reported that the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank will inform the branches of the Bank of China and Bank of Communications in both locations and the Shanghai office of the Central Trust Bureau to take note and handle the matter. As for the repayment method for the interest of 421.875 yuan and the principal of 1.125.000 yuan of the 17th-year Financial Long-Term Public Bond due on March 31, the Central Bank has not yet received an order from the Ministry.</p>
<p>Public Confidence Restored Bond Market Stabilized</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance was determined to maintain credit, the bond market in Shanghai's informal trading market stabilized yesterday. The change to paying at the Chongqing head office proves that there is no delay. These two types of public bonds, Uniform and Reconstruction, which are about to mature, will be repaid in full as usual. As a result, public confidence in the market has been restored. Yesterday's closing prices were: Class A 56.35 yuan, Class B 49.9 yuan, Class C 48.85 yuan, Class D 48.1 yuan, and Class E 48.35 yuan, an increase of 0.15 to 0.5 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>West Shanghai Guerrillas Active at the Front Lines Four Japanese Soldiers Killed in Xujing Town Japanese Soldiers on Hongqiao Road Under Threat</h3>
<p>The situation in West Shanghai has become more tense recently due to the activity of Chinese guerrillas. According to information gathered yesterday from Chinese sources who arrived in Shanghai from West Shanghai, four Japanese soldiers in Xujing Town along the Qingpu-Shanghai Highway were killed by Chinese guerrillas the day before yesterday (the 17th). Yesterday morning, the Japanese sent over a hundred soldiers from Shanghai to conduct a large-scale search. Guerrillas went to Chengjiaqiao on Hongqiao Road and arrested</p>
<p>a Chinese traitor.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday (the 18th), a Japanese man in plainclothes was killed by guerrillas near the Public Works Department garden, east of the Daitoa Bunka Gakuin on Hongqiao Road outside the Western District of the concession. According to foreign sources, on the afternoon of the 18th, a Taiwanese man hired a truck to transport rice for the Japanese army. When the truck traveled to the</p>
<p>vicinity of the nursery</p>
<p>on Hongqiao Road, it was suddenly encountered by a squad of Chinese guerrillas, who arrived on bicycles. They immediately ordered the truck to stop. The Chinese guerrillas took the rice and the truck, and shot and wounded the Taiwanese man. However, the Chinese people in the truck with the Taiwanese man were not harmed. Afterwards, the Japanese army imposed martial law on Hongqiao Road, but the Chinese guerrillas had already calmly retreated. It is believed that the Chinese guerrillas are clearly</p>
<p>approaching the concession</p>
<p>area outside the Western District, so the Japanese army in West Shanghai is extremely panicked. Yesterday morning (the 19th) at eight o'clock, the Japanese army dispatched 400 to 500 soldiers from the city center, along with tanks and armored vehicles, and carried many small steel cannons, to conduct field exercises and demonstrations in the area of Zhongshan Road, Lincoln Road, Bailinan Road, and Hongqiao Road, which will continue for several days. The section of the exercises is located near the British and French defense areas, and the time of the exercises is from 8:00 AM to 10:00 AM.</p>
<p>Its headquarters</p>
<p>is located in Zhenjia Township. All areas west of Zhongshan Road, north of Lincoln Road, east of Warren Road, and south of Bailinan Road are within its exercise range. Also, in Huojia Town near Xujiahui, the Japanese army has another exercise every day from 12:00 PM to 3:00 PM. It is also heard that Hongqiao Road will be closed to all traffic for the next few days to facilitate martial law. According to the North China Daily News, several roads in West Shanghai were closed from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Orphanage for Refugee Children Building New Facilities Preparatory Meeting Held Yesterday Donation Methods Established</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Orphanage for Refugee Children, located at No. 9, Shengde Lane, Xiafei Road, has taken in 207 refugee children since its establishment. The orphanage has recently experienced an increasing number of refugee children requesting admission, and the existing facilities are insufficient. In addition to the pharmacy, hairdressing, knitting, music, and drama departments, which have already been established, other major departments have been unable to start on schedule due to the lack of buildings to establish workshops. The orphanage authorities plan to build new facilities and expand operations. They recently sent letters to seek assistance and have obtained support from participating organizations, including 18 trade associations from the pharmaceutical, weaving, freight transportation, steel bar and scrap iron industries, as well as 20 organizations from the Shanghai opera, opera, research association, and entertainment association.

<h3>工部局 Taxpayers' Grievances Over Salary Increases: Weak Police and Firepower, Unjustified Salary Increases for High-Ranking Officials, Taxpayers to Take Action</h3>
<p>According to the English-language North China Daily News, taxpayers and other residents have been exchanging various opinions regarding the Shanghai Municipal Council's (工部局) salary increases. Suggestions have been made that the Council should allocate funds to hire police, firefighters, and public works personnel, rather than continuing to add substantial salaries to already highly-paid senior officials, which wastes funds. Preparations are underway to initiate a public investigation into the entire affair. Furthermore, they</p>
<p>Criticize the Bureau's</p>
<p>division of staff into different grades, alleging that it is intended to prevent joint action among employees, and mock the Council's motto of "Union is Strength." They criticize the Council's salary cuts and layoffs. The Council previously established an economy committee that reduced the personnel and equipment of the Fire Brigade to below safe standards, resulting in frequent fires last winter, necessitating the recruitment of untrained individuals to</p>
<p>Assist in the Work</p>
<p>The Council continues to congratulate itself, claiming savings of over one million yuan. However, as a result, the Western District of the Public Settlement is filled with factories, all plans for which must be inspected by the Council. The Public Works Department and the Fire Brigade are extremely busy due to staff reductions, the busiest they have ever been. During the construction of these factories, there are no</p>
<p>Sufficient Police</p>
<p>to supervise or prevent the unauthorized addition of buildings. However, because of the inability to prevent it, unauthorized buildings have indeed been constructed. Should carelessness occur, it will be difficult for the Fire Brigade to extinguish the flames. The tragic fire on Avenue Edward VII (愛多亞路) last Saturday is one such example. As for the inadequate protection of the roads outside the Settlement by the police, this has been the case for several years. The police force in the outposts in that area has been weak for at least seven years. Now, it is necessary to borrow a large number of personnel from</p>
<p>Other Police Stations</p>
<p>to patrol in the Western District. If the area north of the Suzhou Creek is opened up, the insufficient personnel in the police force will be a major obstacle, but the Council may not be particularly concerned about this matter, as the area south of the Suzhou Creek already generates substantial revenue. Therefore, the opinion of taxpayers and residents is that the sixty thousand yuan spent on salary increases for a small number of highly-paid officials should be given to lower-paid staff or used to hire more personnel. Now is the time for taxpayers to take action. They have established a group called the Shanghai Municipal Council Taxpayers' Investigation Committee, which has begun its work.</p>

<h3>Taiwan Sugar Smuggling Confirmed: Only 20,000 Piculs Inspected by Customs, Japanese Newspaper Claims One Million Entered Shanghai</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, accurate information regarding the quantity of Taiwan sugar imported under customs control was obtained yesterday (the 18th) from the Statistics Department of the Jianghai Customs. It revealed that from January 1st to 17th, only 110,000 kilograms of Taiwan sugar, valued at 77,000 Customs Gold Units, were imported through customs. For the entire past year, only 3,000 kilograms of Taiwan sugar, valued at only 2,040 Customs Gold Units, were imported through the Jianghai Customs. The total of both is 115,000 kilograms, equivalent to</p>
<p>Approximately 20,000 Piculs.</p>
<p>However, according to the Japanese-language Continental New News published in this port on January 11th, the Taiwan sugar that has already been imported into this port amounts to one million piculs. The amount that has not been imported through customs reaches a huge 980,000 piculs. This figure is undoubtedly the amount of Taiwan sugar smuggled into Shanghai. Now there can be no doubt, and the Continental New News’s report of one million piculs of Taiwan sugar imported is of course absolutely true. On January 13th, a Japanese spokesperson stated at a press conference that the previous article exposing the smuggling of Taiwan sugar into Shanghai was not based on accurate figures, but that</p>
<p>This Large Amount of Taiwan Sugar</p>
<p>was shipped to Shanghai in late last month. However, the customs report for last month did not record any Taiwan sugar imports. The Japanese spokesperson first said that they would investigate, and then claimed that the sugar would be inspected by the Jianghai Customs, but this statement clearly contradicts the news of the Continental New News that one million catties of Taiwan sugar had already been imported into Shanghai. What the Continental New News reported is absolutely true, without any doubt. According to the customs report of this port, the import of Taiwan sugar was very small last November, and has increased relatively since January 1st. However, Taiwan sugar has been</p>
<p>Dumped in Shanghai</p>
<p>since last February. There are both retail and wholesale distributors of Taiwan sugar in Hongkou (虹口), as well as throughout the entire Jinghu Hang (京滬杭) area, and it is even smuggled into the two settlements. A few days ago, the reporter met with personnel from the Dutch trading companies who were importing Java sugar to Shanghai for sale. They all stated that the smuggling of Taiwan sugar into Shanghai has caused the Java sugar trade in this port to decline sharply. Therefore, the</p>
<p>980,000 Piculs</p>
<p>of smuggled sugar is a fact. This large quantity of Taiwan sugar is valued at 16 million yuan, and the unpaid customs duties amount to several million yuan. Foreign reporters in this port have suspected that the interpreter at the Japanese press conference may not have accurately conveyed the words of his "master," and this seems to have cleared up the doubt.</p>
<h3>Headquarters of the 10th Army Group Expedites Cargo Transport: Exported Goods Must Be Approved, Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and Butterfield &amp; Swire Carry Hong Kong Cargo</h3>
<p>After the Headquarters of the 10th Army Group Commander-in-Chief adjusted the Zhejiang Eastern sea routes and approved the sailing of the Valley Line, the loading of cargo must be approved by the Zhejiang Product Agency and the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters.

Exported local goods that have been approved and issued a certificate may be transported for export by approved and registered vessels.

<p>Foreign Vessels Sail Zhejiang-Hong Kong Route</p>
<p>Local products controlled by the Trade Commission, such as tung oil and tea, which must be transported to Hong Kong for centralized export, are designated to be transported by five vessels of the British company Butterfield &amp; Swire, namely Nanchang, Chengdu, Niuzhuang, Yingzhou, and Nanning, and two vessels of the British company Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., namely Hengsheng and Fusheng, directly from ports such as Yongwen and Tai. As for the tung oil purchased in eastern Zhejiang by the Central Trust Bureau entrusted by the Ministry of Finance and the Trade Commission, it is also transported to Hong Kong on the vessels of Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.</p>

<h3>New Life Movement Association Cares About Fellow Sufferers: Stipulates Standards for Implementing Relief, Adjusts the Structure of Charity Groups to Promote Relief Work, Continues to Raise Winter Clothing and Rewards Overseas Chinese for Donations, Orders Local New Life Movement Branches to Comply</h3>
<p>Chairman Chiang of the New Life Movement Promotion Association, in view of the fact that nineteen months have passed since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, and that the need for assistance for soldiers at the front and fellow sufferers in various places is indeed urgent and imminent during this severe winter season, has specially promulgated four standards for implementing this winter's relief campaign, continuing to raise relief funds and materials such as cotton clothing and vests, and has also stipulated that those who donate the most will be commended. He has already ordered the New Life Movement branches and offices in various places to comply. The four standards for implementing the relief campaign are recorded below:</p>
<p>Jointly Promote Relief Work</p>
<p>(1) Regarding refugee relief, the Refugee Relief work has been specially handled by the Relief Committee, which has established a Refugee Relief Committee for Extraordinary Times to take charge of the work. Branches, sub-branches, relief districts, transportation terminals, sub-stations, and reception centers have been set up in various places to implement the evacuation, distribution, accommodation, management, and relief of refugees, and to plan the improvement of refugees' lives, the introduction of occupations, the establishment of factories, the implementation of land reclamation, and the education of refugee children. The work is complex and requires powerful parties to jointly promote it. All our New Life Movement associations in various places should give full assistance to all the above-mentioned work of the Association at any time according to the local situation, and should especially strengthen efforts in publicity and guidance to promote it together and achieve substantial results. As for those New Life Movement associations where the above-mentioned various relief agencies have already been set up, they should adopt close contact, divide the work and cooperate in case of emergency, and give full play to their own functions, so as to achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>Continue to Raise Winter Clothing</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the raising of winter clothing, the winter season has arrived, and severe cold is imminent. The need for winter clothing for soldiers at the front and fellow sufferers in various places is extremely urgent. The work of raising winter clothing is being actively carried out by the National Winter Clothing Campaign Association, which has established branches in various places to carry out its fundraising plan, raising four million cotton vests for distribution to soldiers at the front, and five million pieces of old cotton clothing for distribution to refugees in various places, and is allowed to convert one national currency yuan into one cotton vest, and five corners into one piece of old cotton clothing for fundraising. Since then, various places have enthusiastically donated and delivered materials, and considerable results have been achieved. However, the need for this winter clothing is extremely urgent, and the number is also extremely large, and it depends on the joint efforts of all parties to achieve complete success. All our New Life Movement associations in various places should assist in a timely manner, and use sincere guidance and powerful publicity to promote justice and fulfill their duties.</p>
<p>Adjust Charity Groups and Organizational Structure</p>
<p>(3) Regarding charitable organizations, there are quite a number of original charitable organizations in various places. Although the organizational work and funding conditions are different, their work purposes are all within the scope of relief. However, because the establishment has been different, and the causes are not uniform, the implementation of the work is inevitably uneven, and while there are not a few who have achieved significant results, there are also many who are not worthy of their name. In the current situation of prolonged resistance and frequent relief efforts, it is appropriate to effectively improve the work efficiency of these organizations, so that they can work together and seek truth from facts, and contribute to the country and the nation. All our New Life Movement associations in various places should carefully consider the local situation, and convene consultations or individual visits to the extreme with a sincere attitude, to urge them to clarify the mission of relief in the period of the War of Resistance and national construction, and strive to automatically adjust the organization, closely unite among each other, and work together and help each other, so as to promote cooperation and achieve practical results.</p>
<p>Encourage Overseas Chinese to Continue Donating</p>
<p>(4) Regarding overseas Chinese, since the War of Resistance, overseas Chinese in various places have enthusiastically donated and delivered materials for various fundraising relief items. The facts are there. The current situation is becoming increasingly tense, and the demand for relief forces is becoming more and more urgent. This large and reliable source must be worked hard to ensure that it is inexhaustible, so as to overcome difficulties together and strengthen the War of Resistance. All our New Life Movement associations for overseas Chinese should actively promote and guide them in a timely manner, and promote the patriotism and love for their hometowns of the local overseas Chinese, so as to continue to donate and promote the former beauty. We should also find ways to start an investigation, and list the names, resumes, and actual achievements of those overseas Chinese who donate or collect relief funds and materials particularly generously, and report them to the Association, and give them honorary awards to encourage them.</p>

<h3>Investigating the Economic Aggression in Guerrilla Areas: The Ministry of Economic Affairs Specially Formulates a Form and Distributes it to Industrial and Commercial Firms for Completion</h3>
<p>In order to investigate the economic aggression in guerrilla areas, the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government has recently specially formulated a form for distribution and investigation. The form lists (1) the name of the industrial and commercial firm, (2) its location, and (3) the name and nationality of the manager or principal person.

(4) The business operated and the name of the product (5) the trademark, refers to all trademark names and patterns originally used by the factory number, and whether they have been registered should be checked and filled in. If it is seized, controlled, or used and then other trademarks are used, it should also be clearly stated. (6) The detailed situation of being seized, controlled, or used by the Japanese. So-called seizure, such as a factory number originally operated by Chinese people, was illegally seized and continued to be operated after it was occupied. The so-called control, such as supplying raw materials to factories and forcibly collecting finished products without compensation or at low prices, and dumping them in other places under its control or manipulation. The so-called use, such as Japanese people inducing manufacturers or third-country manufacturers to package them on their behalf and impersonate Chinese or other countries' goods. In all these cases, the investigation should be carried out and filled in in detail. (7) The product sales situation after being seized, controlled, or used by the Japanese. This column should fill in the production capacity, sales area, or sales methods. (8) Remarks.</p>

<h3>Suggestions for Frugal Donations</h3>
<p>— Chen Jie</p>
<p>The nation and its people have reached a critical juncture of survival; no negligence or neglect of personnel is allowed. To be miserly with money and not donate is to risk our descendants becoming slaves.</p>
<p>Dear compatriots in adversity:</p>
<p>Our motherland's sacred national self-defense war has been raging for eighteen months. Apart from those who are insane and soulless beasts in human clothing, every citizen of the Republic of China eagerly anticipates the arrival of final victory. However, this arduous and great task cannot be achieved through empty talk or reliance on others. Every compatriot must dedicate their utmost effort towards this goal to achieve success and complete this unprecedented task in history!</p>
<p>A nation is formed by each and every compatriot. In other words, every compatriot has a stake in the nation. We must not merely blame the soldiers on the front lines for risking their lives to fight the enemy while forgetting our own responsibilities. Although we may not be able to directly take up arms and defend the country, at the very least, we must contribute as much economic power as possible and practice the principle of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength" in the process of resisting aggression and building the nation, in order to support this long-term war that will determine the survival of our country. We are well aware that in the current environment, our meager income is barely enough to make ends meet. However, we also understand that this is indeed a critical moment for the survival of the nation and its people. No negligence or carelessness is allowed, and no neglect or delay of any person or matter is permitted. We must concentrate the human and material resources of all compatriots to jointly drive out the tyrannical enemy. Therefore, even though we are poor, when we think of the clear teaching that the rise and fall of the nation is the responsibility of every individual, and that personal matters are small while national matters are great, we are willing to further engage in frugal living in our already difficult circumstances, and dedicate whatever we earn entirely to the nation, to fulfill the duties of a citizen!</p>
<p>We must not think that individual efforts are insignificant and of no benefit to the overall situation. This is a despicable excuse to shirk responsibility. It is important to understand that even a small contribution has an effect. If each of our 450 million compatriots contributes one cent, we can obtain over 5.6 million bullets. If each person contributes ten cents, we can obtain over 1,000 tanks. If each person contributes one yuan, we can obtain over 2,000 fighter planes. Can such strength still be considered small? The saying "many grains of sand form a pagoda, many fox furs make a robe" clearly teaches that accumulating small amounts can lead to great things.</p>
<p>We must not be clever and think that resisting aggression and saving the nation is someone else's business, and that we do not need to concern ourselves with it, and instead seek personal comfort and enjoyment in the present. This is a most shameful and corrupt thought born of a slavish mentality. It is important to understand that if the nation perishes, individuals and their descendants will only live a life of slavery, with no freedom or room for enjoyment. Are the Jews not a famously wealthy people in the world? However, the Jews could not exchange their wealth for a stable life, and instead were exiled to foreign lands, living a displaced and inhuman life, often being driven out and oppressed. They were not only unable to enjoy comfort, but even their lives were not guaranteed! Does this not prove that a slave of a lost nation has absolutely no freedom or enjoyment? The Jews and other people who have lost their countries are struggling daily in a tragic situation of suppressing their voices and tears, trying to accomplish the great task of restoring their homeland. But alas, they have already been tightly bound. When their country was being invaded, their ancestors lacked the determination to resist and were unwilling to sacrifice their personal wealth to safeguard the survival of the country, leading to their descendants being trapped in the pit of slavery forever, unable to be reborn. Tracing the root cause, it is all because their ancestors were greedy for temporary comfort and made a big mistake. Dear compatriots! They made a fatal mistake due to a momentary thought, leaving endless regret for their descendants. When we think of this, can we not feel our hair stand on end and shudder? Now we still have the opportunity to defend our country. Our supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, is leading all compatriots in a long-term war of resistance, striking back at the aggressors. Moreover, the enemy's feet are sinking deeper and deeper into the mud, and the day of their collapse is within sight. The key to our final victory is hanging by a thread. Can we bear to be slaves of a lost nation and miss this only opportunity to revive our nation? Dear compatriots! Wealthy compatriots! Wake up quickly! Do not only seek personal comfort, do not be stingy with money and value it more than protecting the country. You should also think about your descendants.</p>
<p>The soldiers on the front lines are fighting bravely and regarding death as home, using their flesh and blood to resist the enemy's guns and cannons! They are offering their most precious lives to the nation and its people. What is it for? It is only to defend the beautiful rivers and mountains left behind by our ancestors! We are also part of the nation, can we bear to stand by and shirk the responsibility we should bear for the country? No! Never! For the independence and freedom of the Chinese nation! In order to wash away past humiliations, in order to avenge the compatriots who were killed and the loyal and brave soldiers who sacrificed themselves to defend the country, we must take out the strength condensed from everyone's sweat and blood. We should establish a voluntary commitment to frugality and donation, remembering that contributing even a little strength can increase our chances of victory. We must condense the strength of our 450 million compatriots into a brand new, independent, and free New China!</p>
<p>Outline of the Frugal Donation Group:</p>
<p>(1) Purpose: To encourage each other to overcome national difficulties, save financial resources, and contribute to the country to support the war of resistance to the end.</p>
<p>(2) Members: Anyone who agrees with the purpose of frugality and is able to fulfill it may join.</p>
<p>(3) Organization: Based on relationships such as residential area, hometown, school, and classmates, form a group of ten people. Each group will have one secretary responsible for liaison and presiding. All donations will be collected by the secretary and submitted to the receiving organization (newspaper office or bank). All receipts must be publicly announced or circulated at any time to ensure credibility. If there are too many people, another group can be formed.</p>
<p>(4) Meetings: Each month, rotate holding meetings in the form of family tea parties, dinners, or other gatherings, to report on progress and discuss the promotion of work.</p>
<p>(5) Work: Conscientiously practice frugality (each member should encourage everyone to save at least one cent of national currency per day, the more the better, each according to their ability), try to use domestic goods, persuade relatives and friends to be frugal, and make them participate in promoting the work and promote the spirit of saving the nation.</p>
<p>(6) Creed: We cannot survive without saving the country, we cannot save the country without organization, ten people with one heart will become a basic organization of iron.</p>
<p>(7) Commandments: Do not waste ambition on dancing, do not waste money on prostitution and gambling, do not be stingy with money to contribute to the country, and do not buy or sell enemy goods.</p>
<h3>News on the Merged Practical Creditors Group: Continued Registration of Creditor's Rights, Telegram Requesting the Ministry of Finance to Supervise</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ningbo Industrial Bank Creditors Group, which was previously initiated by Mr. Liu and Mr. Gao respectively, has seen quite enthusiastic registration of creditor's rights. It is now reported that the two creditor groups, in order to plan unified action steps, have merged with each other, cooperated effectively, and held a joint meeting of creditor representatives of both parties at the Jianzhong Law Office in the Securities Building the day before yesterday to discuss all negotiation methods after the merger. It was decided that: (1) to expand the organization and continue to register creditor's rights; (2) to send a letter of inquiry to Chen Zhonggao, chairman of the bank's resumption movement, regarding the progress of promoting resumption; (3) to telegraph the Ministry of Finance, requesting strict supervision of the bank's directors and supervisors to be responsible for clearing debts, and other important cases, to be carried out in an orderly manner.</p>
<h3>British Naval Ship Deployment</h3>
<p>Suffolk Returns Home: According to Continental Daily, it was claimed by responsible parties yesterday (the 17th) that the British cruiser HMS Suffolk, currently docked at the Bund in the Shanghai International Settlement, will leave Shanghai next Monday (the 23rd) for Hong Kong, the Philippine Islands, and South Australia, before returning to Portsmouth, England for temporary decommissioning, complete inspection, and repair. It is expected to be re-commissioned in September and is expected to be re-assigned to the China Station.</p>
<p>Cardiff Arrives in Shanghai: According to the English-language China Press, the British light cruiser HMS Cardiff, having set sail from Manila, is expected to arrive in Shanghai on Saturday (the 21st), replacing the British ship HMS Suffolk, which will leave Shanghai on Sunday. The Cardiff weighs 4,290 tons. It left Hankou rapidly via the Yangtze River before Christmas 1937 and returned to England.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing, Xiashi, and Jiashan: Postal Remittances Resume, Temporarily Limited to 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>The three post offices of Jiaxing, Xiashi, and Jiashan along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, since resuming business, have been limited to ordinary, registered, and express services only, and have not yet resumed parcel and remittance services.

<h3>Yunnan Provincial Government Manages Commercial Banks in the Province: Establishment Requires Prior Application for Approval</h3>
<p>The Yunnan Provincial Government, in order to stabilize the economic foundation of the rear area during the war and protect the legitimate business of various banks, in view of the fact that banks from various places are coming to Yunnan to establish branches, believes that it is necessary to comprehensively manage the banks within the province, except for the national banks and the Fu Dian New Bank, and has designated the Finance Department as the executing management agency. It stipulates that banks establishing branches or offices in the province must report to the Finance Department and forward it to the Provincial Government for record. Operations can only begin after approval, and thirteen measures have been formulated and ordered to be promulgated and implemented.</p>

<h3>Young Woman Secretly Poisons Stepmother, Stepmother Dies Tragically, Mother and Daughter Often Quarrel, Leading to Malice, Girl Reveals Hidden Truth, Case is Finally Discovered</h3>
<p>Zhuang Xu, an old woman from Songjiang, residing at No. 146, Lane 572, Peng Road, is 60 years old and has recently been suffering from stomach ailments and coughing. She lives with her adopted daughter, Qian Zhuang, who is 32 years old and already married. The daughter is known to be fond of wandering and extravagant, leading to frequent quarrels between mother and daughter. Before the outbreak of the Shanghai War, the daughter was severely scolded by her mother for something. In a moment of anger, she wanted to commit suicide and went to a Japanese pharmacy on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, paid three yuan, and bought a bottle of poisonous pills, a total of ten pills, and brought them home, intending to swallow them and end her life, so as to avoid</p>
<p>All sorts of troubles</p>
<p>There was no interest in living in this world. At that time, because she could not abandon her four children, two boys and two girls, she did not perform this tragedy. She secretly hid the bottle of pills until now. Her husband, Qian Wenbiao, knew nothing about it. Over time, there were frequent quarrels between the mother and daughter, and Qian Zhuang, feeling that her adoptive mother, Zhuang Xu, was old and garrulous, suddenly had malicious intentions. Taking advantage of the fact that her mother was decocting herbs to treat her stomach ailment and cough drops in the courtyard on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at 8:30, she secretly took out the ten pills and put them into the medicine pot. After the mother drank it, on the morning before yesterday</p>
<p>At four o'clock, the poison took effect</p>
<p>Gasping for breath on the bed, she was rushed to Guangren Hospital for treatment but it was too late and she died after a while. Guo Cai, Zhuang Xu's niece, noticed that the deceased's palms were black and saliva was flowing from her mouth. Knowing that her aunt's death was definitely due to accidentally drinking some kind of poison and being secretly harmed, she questioned Qian Zhuang's biological daughter, Yu Zhen (11 years old). Yu Zhen said that she had seen her grandmother's cough medicine pot, and her mother had put a package of pills into it. Guo Cai then learned that Qian Zhuang had</p>
<p>Murdered her adoptive mother</p>
<p>And hurriedly reported it to the Huixin Detective Office, which dispatched Chinese Detective Fang Qingyun to No. 34 Maber Road to arrest Qian Zhuang and take her to the police station for detention. At the same time, Zhuang Xu's body was taken to the Jiaozhou Road Mortuary for examination. Yesterday morning, the police station escorted Qian Zhuang to the Third Criminal Tribunal of the First Special District Court. Police station lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the case and requested an extension to keep the defendant in custody. Following this, Guo Cai and the defendant's</p>
<p>Eleven-year-old daughter</p>
<p>Qian Yuzhen, provided proof. According to the deceased's son-in-law, Qian Wenbiao, the mother and daughter often quarreled in the past, blaming his wife for loving to travel and spending money, with no other matters. Unfortunately, such a thing happened. When asked of Qian Zhuang, she directly admitted that she had put the poisonous pills into the pot of cough medicine that her mother had drunk, without denying it. Judge Huang Risheng ordered that she remain in custody and rescheduled the hearing for seven days later.</p>
<h3>A Paper Package Under the Armpit, Smuggled Opium Found, Totaling 124 Taels, Two Masterminds on the Run</h3>
<p>Chief Detective Ye Yuxi and detectives Guo Shouxin of the Seventh Criminal Section of the General Patrol Room learned that opium dealers were transporting opium and waiting to make contact in the Datong Lane, Shanhaiguan Road, Datong Lane. They secretly waited in Datong Lane at 10:10 on the morning of the day before yesterday and arrested Zhang Fugui, a resident of Ningbo. A paper package was found under his armpit, containing 124 taels of opium. He was taken to the Xinzha Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special Court. Police station lawyer Li Zhishan presented the case, prosecuted him in accordance with Article 5 of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Opium Prohibition, and requested a postponement in order to arrest his accomplices. Zhang Fugui confessed that this matter was entrusted to him by Wang Youxing and Bao Afa, who are on the run, to buy MSG, and he did not know it was opium, and he also hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. Judge Liu reviewed the confession and ordered Zhang to remain in custody and reschedule the hearing for seven days later.</p>
<h3>Smuggling Opium, Japanese and Puppets Compete, A Large Amount of Opium Intercepted on the Takasho Shosho Maru</h3>
<p>After the implementation of the public sale of opium in Shanghai West, the uneven distribution of profits between the Japanese and puppets has caused fierce undercurrents. The puppet authorities are now intercepting the transportation of opium in Pudong, except for those with armed protection. On the morning of the 16th, the puppet "Water Patrol Team" confiscated more than 1,600 taels of opium on a Shosho Maru small steamer on the Takasho Pudong surface, and detained seven smugglers including Shen Abing (namely Blind Abing, who was sentenced to 15 years in prison by the court for making red pills before the war, and was released after the Shanghai War). Yesterday, they were sent to the puppet "Judicial Department" for disposal. It is heard that the puppet authorities took this action to retaliate against the Shanghai opium trade for not reporting their income, it is said.</p>
<h3>Husband and Father-in-Law Abusing Each Other, Young Woman Sues for Divorce, Marriage Forced by Parents, Never Lived Together in Eight Years, Court Recommends Reconciliation and Reschedules Hearing</h3>
<p>Wang Changfu, a native of Huzhou, residing at No. 23, Lane 228, Tongfu Road, Shanghai West, runs a silk business and is quite wealthy, owning real estate in Jiangwan. Since the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, his property has fallen into the war zone and his business has also suffered a setback, and his livelihood is not as prosperous as it used to be. His eldest son, Jiajun, is now twenty-eight years old and is still studying at university. As the national army retreated westward, most of the schools were moved to safe areas in Xiang, Shu, Dian, and Qian, and Jiajun went to Chongqing to study at Tongji University. This time, he asked for leave and came to Shanghai last month, and was immediately</p>
<p>Sued by his wife, Ling Juanhua</p>
<p>Lawyer Zu Yufu, sued the First Special District District Court for permission to live apart and ordered Changfu and Jiajun, father and son, to jointly pay alimony. The marriage of Jiajun and Juanhua was arranged by the parents of both parties at that time. At the time of the engagement, Jiajun was still studying at Jiangwan Lida Academy. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, a auspicious date was chosen. Jiajun, upon hearing that his father Changfu would also remarry, showed that he did not want to marry. Then, Changfu told him that if he could marry the woman on schedule, he would dispel the idea of remarrying. Jiajun then followed strict orders and held a wedding with Miss Ling at Hongyun Restaurant. At that time, his family was still at the San Tai Pier in Nanshi. That evening</p>
<p>Guests filled the door</p>
<p>During the feast, a guest suddenly said to Jiajun, "In half a month, those of us who congratulate you tonight will congratulate your father again." Jiajun was shocked to realize that his father's words were untrustworthy. In anger, he left home for school the next day. Since then, he did not often return home. When he did, he showed very little affection for his new bride. For seven or eight years, he did not change this attitude. Juanhua initially thought that although she was subjected to her husband's cold shoulder, she was fortunate to be favored by her father-in-law, so she did not feel pain. However, two years ago, due to a lawsuit with her father-in-law over a deposit, she actually won the case, but the father-in-law and daughter-in-law became estranged from then on and returned to her mother's house. When Huzhou fell, she still returned to live in Shanghai. Changfu could not help but speak harshly to her, and Juanhua felt that</p>
<p>Her husband and father-in-law were abusing her</p>
<p>Making it really unbearable to live together. Last month, Jiajun came back and told relatives and friends that divorce was the only way to relieve the pain of both parties. Therefore, Juanhua believed that she had reached the end of her rope and there was no way to recover, so she filed a lawsuit with the court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ni Zheng Ao opened a hearing and summoned the defendants Wang Changfu and Wang Jiajun, father and son, who did not appear in court, but only sent lawyers to represent them. The plaintiff, Ling Juanhua, explained the facts of the years after the marriage, stating that she had never lived with Jiajun for a single night. In recent years, the treatment of the elders has become increasingly cold, and she is not even full. At this point, she burst into tears, and her attorney then presented a more systematic statement of the</p>
<p>Abuse situation</p>
<p>To the court and requested that she be separated from the defendants, and that the defendants, father and son, be ordered to withdraw 12,000 yuan and deposit it in the court as a fund for the plaintiff's living expenses of 100 yuan per month. She also requested that the defendants be summoned to court, so that the facts of the abuse could be clearly questioned. Then, the defendants' lawyers refuted each of the points of the plaintiff's accusation one by one, stating that the plaintiff still had thousands of yuan from the lawsuit stored in the bank. The plaintiff claimed that she had lost it on the way to escape, which was not true. There must be resources to maintain her life, and the defendants did not admit to the abuse. Judge Ni</p>
<p>Encouraged reconciliation outside the court. He then ordered a rescheduling of the hearing.</p>

<p>Multiple Robberies</p>
<p>Including the robbery of a certain timber company on Beihai Road and the major case of accidentally killing Liu Zujian, etc. Lawyer Li Sanshan of the Shanghai Municipal Council sued them in accordance with Article 304 and Article 271 of the Criminal Code and the Regulations on the Prohibition of Military Firearms. After repeated trials and clear clarification by the First Special District District Court, Judge Qian Hongye again interrogated them yesterday afternoon and immediately announced the verdict: Qian Shaohua was sentenced to six years of imprisonment, Ji Silang was sentenced to five years and six months of imprisonment, Wang Mingyan was sentenced to five years of imprisonment, Wang Ziming was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment, Wang Gengwu and Liu Peilin were</p>

A total of five confiscated handguns and Mausers, 176 bullets, and other contraband were all confiscated. Lawyer Li of the Shanghai Municipal Council declared that he would appeal the acquittal of Wang Yuheng and Ji Zhangquan and immediately released them in court. However, Wang Guozhang, Wang Yifei, and Wang Shaotai were sent to court by the French Police Station, so during the appeal period, he requested that they be remanded to custody. The court approved the request.</p>
<h3>Japanese Trading Company Interpreter Falsely Reports Plot to Harm, Claims Someone Accused Him of Being a Traitor, Mostly Due to a Guilty Conscience</h3>
<p>Feng Guoji, a native of Tongzhou, is thirty years old and lives at No. 345, Kunming Road. He works as an interpreter for the Japanese trading company Ishii on Sichuan Road, No. 330. Recently, Feng suddenly became nervous, often feeling that someone was accusing him of being a traitor and plotting to harm his life. At 7:00 on the afternoon of the day before yesterday, Feng suddenly went to the Wayside Police Station to report to interpreter Situ Guanghe, stating that four Chinese had come to his house, knocked on the door, and accused him of being a traitor. Observing their behavior, they were actually plotting to harm him, so he came to report. However, after investigation by Chinese Detective Gu Zhongshu, it was discovered that Feng's report was actually a psychological effect caused by neurological disorder after drinking, which was completely untrue. He was detained because Feng should not have made such a false report. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Fourth Criminal Tribunal of the First Special Court. Police station lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted him in accordance with Article 214 of the Criminal Code and presented the fact that Feng had also reported to the police station last year that someone had thrown bricks at his house. After questioning by Judge Zhan Liangce, Feng was given appropriate punishment.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Special Edition: Shanghai Schools During the War of Resistance - Education - Chong Gan</h3>
<p>Shanghai is China's largest metropolis, covering an area of 49,469 square kilometers. According to pre-war statistics, it had a population of 3,264,229, not only being the center of national industry and commerce and economy, but also the most developed in the country in terms of education and culture. After the start of the War of Resistance, due to its crucial location, it was the first to fall into the war zone. Although the damage suffered by educational and cultural institutions from artillery fire has not yet been statistically analyzed, it can be described as an unprecedented catastrophe. Fortunately, the education administrative authorities and educators at all levels have been able to uphold public loyalty and support the country, enduring hardships. A portion of the schools in the war zone have moved into the concessions to start classes within possible limits, while those originally in the concessions have continued teaching without interruption to this day. Furthermore, due to the sharp increase in the population of Shanghai after the war and the large number of young people attending school, many schools have also been established to meet social needs. In addition, due to the expansion of the war zone, many schools from neighboring provinces have relocated to Shanghai to resume classes. All of these efforts are sufficient to barely maintain the lifeline of education. This article briefly describes the general situation of higher education, secondary education, primary education, and compulsory education during the War of Resistance, in order to inform those concerned about Shanghai's education during the War of Resistance.</p>
<p>1.  Higher Education</p>
<p>Before the war, there were a total of 31 schools above the junior college level in Shanghai. A list is provided below:</p>
<p>Shanghai Pre-War Junior College and Above Schools List</p>
<p>National: Jiaotong University, Tongji University, Jinan University, Shanghai Business College, Shanghai Medical College, Sino-French Engineering College, Music Conservatory, Transportation Department Merchant Marine School, Ministry of Finance Taxation Academy Shanghai First Branch and Second Branch, Sino-French University Pharmaceutical College. Private: Datong University, Daxia University, Aurora University, Shanghai Baptist University, Fudan University, Guanghua University, China Institute, Shanghai Women's Medical College, Shanghai Law College, Zhengfeng Arts College, Soochow University Law School, Shanghai College of Law and Political Science, Tongde Medical College, Chih Tze College, Southeast Medical College, East Asia Physical Education College, Xinhua Art College, Shanghai Art College, St. John's University.</p>
<p>Municipal: Shanghai Municipal Physical Education College.</p>
<p>Among the above 31 schools, their pre-war distribution was as follows: 4 in the South Shanghai District, 3 in the Zhabei District, 4 in the First Special District, 7 in the Second Special District, 1 in the Yinyin District, 2 in the Wusong District, 4 in the Jiangwan District, 2 in the city center, 2 in the Zhenru District, and 2 in the Fahua District. According to this calculation, of the 31 schools in the city, with the exception of the 12 schools in the First and Second Special Districts, the remaining 20 schools have all fallen into the war zone. Even among the schools in the Special Districts, some have relocated to other safe locations for classes due to the special environment of their original sites. The extent of the losses can be generally seen. Fortunately, with the hard work of the school authorities, one after another, they moved into the concessions and successively resumed classes. As of now, except for five schools that have been suspended, including Merchant Marine School, Taxation Academy Second Branch, China Institute, and Municipal Physical Education College, and Tongji University, which has moved to the inland areas, the rest continue to operate. Although the material losses are great, the spirit of dedication is even greater. The current status of each school is listed below to show a general overview.</p>

<h3>European Rogue Commits Numerous Crimes - Jewish Woman Deceived - Gold Ring and Gramophone Both Swindled - Sentenced to Six Months, Returns to Prison Life</h3>
<p>As a result of Germany's drastic anti-Jewish policies, the Jews in Germany were like homeless dogs, fleeing in all directions. Among them, many crossed the ocean to Shanghai. Therefore, today, the refugees living in the "isolated island" consist of Chinese and foreigners. The cause of their displacement was created by the invaders. Therefore, we should have sympathy for these Jewish refugees. However, there is a European rogue of uncertain nationality, Morton Lauren Baron, who had just been released from prison. On the day when a ship carrying Jewish refugees arrived in Shanghai from overseas last month, he waited at the pier. When the refugees disembarked, he</p>
<p>Expressed Great Diligence</p>
<p>Acting as a self-appointed guide, he volunteered to be their guide, directing them to places of lodging. Among the refugees, those who were new to Shanghai and had no relatives to turn to thought that they were all people who had fallen to the ends of the earth, and there was no need to know each other upon meeting. They listened to him and followed him, especially a young Polish woman named Hella Lawson Schwiek and another refugee, who were both taken by him to a Westerner hotel on Yuwei Road. Later, he told the two women that they needed to exchange their foreign currency for legal tender in order to use it. The two women agreed, and one gave him one pound of English gold, and the other gave him four pounds, asking him to exchange them for usable legal tender, but they were all embezzled. On</p>
<p>Christmas Eve</p>
<p>The Baron was staying at the Paramount Hotel. He used the excuse of celebrating Christmas to ask the Polish woman to bring a gramophone that she had brought with her from Europe to his residence for them to enjoy together. From then on, the item was never returned. Although the woman sent a letter requesting its return, he ignored it. On the 4th of this month, the Baron was evicted by the hotel owner for owing more than 140 yuan in room and board. The gramophone, along with the Baron's leather bag, was seized. Last week, the Jing'an Temple Police determined that the Baron had not only repeatedly committed fraud against women in Shanghai, for which he had previously been sentenced to imprisonment by the Detention Court and had just been released after serving his term, but also had committed numerous crimes in the United States, Germany, and Italy in previous years. He was indeed a</p>
<p>Scourge of Society</p>
<p>Therefore, he was re-detained and sent to the First Special District District Court. At that time, it was not yet known that he had defrauded Jewish refugees of their property. He was only accused of defrauding the Paramount Hotel of room and board. He had claimed to be an advertising businessman from overseas and a Canadian pilot when he first arrived at the Paramount Hotel. The accusation had already been investigated and was awaiting judgment in custody. The day before yesterday, the Polish woman, Schwiek, reported to the police because the property she had demanded was not returned. However, the other woman who was defrauded of four gold pounds did not request the police to investigate. Therefore, when the sentence was announced yesterday, police lawyer Qian Xunjiu appeared in court to</p>
<p>Add Additional Charges</p>
<p>For defrauding Schwiek of her gold pound note and gramophone, and explained the circumstances of the defendant's fraud, requesting that he be punished accordingly. Questioned, the Baron confessed that after exchanging the gold pounds for legal tender, in addition to expenses such as the woman's luggage transportation costs, the remaining funds were used to buy wine and meat to celebrate Christmas with the woman's consent. The gramophone had been seized by the Paramount Hotel, and he requested to be sent elsewhere to avoid being unable to make a living in Shanghai. After the hearing, the court sentenced him to six months in prison, and he entered prison again to live his prison life. It is said that in the fraud cases he committed in various countries, both in China and abroad, the victims were all women, which shows that he considered women to be easily deceived.</p>
<h3>Five Robberies</h3>
<p>At around 9 PM last night, a Japanese man was walking on Tianjin Road in the Public Concession. At that time, four or five thugs jumped out of a dark place on the side of the road and stopped him. Without saying a word, they searched his body. The Japanese man was unable to resist and had all 45 yuan of Japanese currency stored in his pocket robbed and the thugs escaped. Due to the dim streetlights in that section of the road, the appearance and clothing of all the bandits could not be identified. He went to the police station in charge to report the incident.</p>
<p>At around 6:30 PM yesterday evening, a residence at No. 59, Lane 974, Changping Road was robbed by twelve or thirteen bandits, four of whom were armed. However, the homeowner did not have large savings stored at home, so only clothing and other items worth more than 400 yuan were stolen. The victim provided a detailed list of the stolen items and reported the incident to the police for investigation.</p>
<p>At around 6:10 PM yesterday evening, a cloth shop at No. 48 Wuhu Road was suddenly visited by six bandits. At that time, three armed bandits guarded the people, while other unarmed bandits ransacked the shop. However, because the shop did not have large sums of money, only several tens of dollars were obtained. The bandits, feeling unsatisfied, continued to rob several bolts of cloth stored in the shop and escaped. The total loss was more than 120 yuan. The shop reported the incident to the police and requested a strict investigation.</p>
<p>At around 7 AM yesterday morning, a resident at No. 17, Lane 627, Yuyuan Road in West Shanghai was robbed by four bandits while the victim was still in bed. One bandit held a handgun and threatened everyone, while another bandit held a sharp axe and made a show of force, forcing them to hand over the box keys. The unarmed bandits searched the house and robbed more than 400 yuan in cash and escaped. After the incident, it was reported to the police in charge for record and investigation.</p>
<p>At around 7:20 AM yesterday morning, three bandits broke into No. 4651 Robison Road in West Shanghai. Each bandit held a handgun and threatened the men and women in the house, prohibiting them from making any noise, and forced them to hand over the box keys to ransack the house. However, the house did not have much stored, so only cash, items, etc., worth more than 130 yuan were robbed. The victims reported the robbery to the police and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>Across from the Continental Hotel in an Alley - Drug Trafficking Organization Cracked - 120 Pounds of Opium Seized - 21 Suspects Arrested Separately</h3>
<p>Ye Yuxi, a Chinese detective of the Narcotics Division of the General Police Station, detectives Liu Zhaonian and Guo Shouxin, etc., learned that someone was organizing a large-scale opium trafficking organization at No. 4, Lane 49, next to the Continental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road. The opium was secretly transported to Shanghai from Tianjin. Therefore, they immediately coordinated with Western detective Nanyingte, etc., and went to the address the day before yesterday to search. They seized three boxes of opium, totaling 120 pounds,</p>
<p>Worth 20,000 Yuan</p>
<p>At that time, there was only a sick woman and a maid in the room. According to the maid, who was named Bao Meihua, the opium belonged to her master (the sick woman)'s husband, Little Anhui. Her master was currently in Room 228 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road, etc. The detectives ordered the maid to lead them to Room 228 of the Oriental Hotel, where they arrested Ji Yunfa (Little Anhui), Wang Wenfu, Chen Xiaogouzi, Li Fengming, Zhou Xinhai, Xu Arong, Li Yonghua, Wang Longquan, Chen Asi, Wang Guansheng, and other ten people. Then, they arrested Wang Yinzhang, Zhu Yungao, Li Chunqing, Zhu Xinjie, Song Changqing, Wang Xitang, Xia Xiaosanzi, and other seven people at No. 4, Lane 49. Subsequently, it was learned that there was still</p>
<p>The Main Culprit in the Case</p>
<p>Named Teng Jingshan, in Room 227 of the Zhonghui Building on Edward Road. They went to the address to arrest him, but Teng had already fled. They only arrested Zou Yaodong, Zhang Enhua, Hu Chengzhai, Yu Xiling, and other four people and brought them to the Chengdu Road Police Station. After investigation, the sick woman and the maid were released as they were not involved. The remaining 21 people, including Ji Yunfa, were all detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan detailed the circumstances of the case and requested permission to detain them for investigation. Judge Fu Lin briefly questioned Ji Yunfa and others and ordered that they be detained for seven days for further review.</p>
<h3>Foreign Young Woman Uses Deceptive Tricks - Swindles Diamond Ring</h3>
<p>According to the French-language Shanghai Daily, a foreign young woman, lavishly dressed, came to the Alexander Russian Jewelry Store on Nanjing Road the week before last Sunday and selected</p>
<p>A Ring</p>
<p>Asking someone to wait at the Cathay Hotel for her husband to bring the money. However, when she arrived in front of the store, she suddenly said that she did not want the ring and ordered the person to take it back. After the ring arrived at the store, it was discovered that it had been switched. It was too late to report to the police. It is said that the ring was worth 955 yuan.</p>
<h3>Two Men and Women Commit Suicide by Hanging</h3>
<p>Zhu Yao, a young woman from Ningbo, 26 years old, wearing a blue silk cheongsam, went to Qinghe Inn, Qinghefang, Guangdong Road, with her husband the night before last and booked Room 127. The name Zhang Jun was written on the register. Yesterday afternoon, the couple had a quarrel. Shortly after, after her husband went out, she became depressed and took her own life by hanging herself in the room. The body was taken to Renji Hospital and transferred to the coroner's office to await examination.</p>
<p>Zhou Xiting, a 27-year-old man from Changzhou, lived at No. 10, Tongchang Lane, Haining Road. Zhou went to Tongshang Hostel at No. 42 Avenue Edward VII a few days ago and rented Room 81 to stay overnight. Yesterday, he suddenly committed suicide by hanging himself in the room without anyone knowing. At around 5 PM, his brother-in-law, Chen Asong, came to visit and discovered the body. He immediately called an ambulance to send him to the hospital for treatment. Because he could not be saved, he was transferred to the coroner's office to await examination. It is said that the reason for his suicide was due to economic pressure.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Brewery - News of Transfer is Inaccurate</h3>

<h3>Resistance and Freedom</h3>
<p>— Bai Ying</p>
<p>The American writer Roger William Ries recently published a short essay in the American magazine "Forum" entitled "The Ideal of Liberty." His opening remarks are quite worthy of our contemplation. He said that a professor at Columbia University in the United States once quoted the following passage to a group of people:</p>
<p>The nation and its institutions belong to the people of that nation. Whenever they feel weary of the existing government, they can exercise their constitutional right to amend it or their revolutionary right to overthrow it.</p>
<p>He asked if the above statement was "Red." Some in the audience thought that these words came from Lenin or Stalin, and they expressed great disgust. When he told them that the passage was originally said by Lincoln, the audience nodded in agreement, considering it the truth. The United States is one of the few democratic countries in the present world where people can enjoy freedom of thought and freedom of speech. But in the above example, we can see that the American people—at least a part of them—have not yet obtained true freedom, because in their minds, there is still a prejudice against the enemy of freedom. If this passage were not said by Lincoln, but by Lenin or Stalin, they would express disgust. This attitude indicates that they cannot obtain the true essence of freedom in thought or speech.</p>
<p>However, this does not mean that the United States has no freedom. The United States is one of the countries in the present world that gives its people the most freedom. Originally, if the concept of freedom is understood without the epistemology of practice, this freedom is empty, it is false freedom. A small part of the American people (and other countries as well), because they have been poisoned by fascist propaganda, view the words of Stalin and Lenin as untrustworthy. They seek truth based on personal prejudice, and as a result, they spoil the freedom they can enjoy and should enjoy.</p>
<p>We know that the United States is a highly capitalist country, where the freedom that is valued is individual freedom. They believe that the freedom of democracy lies in developing individual freedom as much as possible. This is like Christianity believing that developing the good side of individuals can create a paradise on earth. But this view of placing too much emphasis on individual freedom is open to criticism.</p>
<p>Materialist philosophy tells us that the category of freedom maintains a relative relationship with the recognition of practice. The deeper our practical understanding, the greater our realm of freedom. But the so-called practical understanding refers to the understanding that progresses along the path of truth. The relationship between understanding and freedom is also applicable to the relationship between understanding and truth.</p>
<p>If we depart from a certain degree of the category of truth and only focus on the development of individual freedom, then individual freedom will inevitably run into a wall, as the aforementioned situation in the United States is an example.</p>
<p>In the case of China during the war of resistance, the situation is exactly the opposite. During the war of resistance, the individual freedom of the Chinese people seems to be quite restricted. Many soldiers who sacrificed their lives on the battlefield lost not only their individual freedom, but even their individual lives. The general pacifist arguments against all wars in the international community stem from this individualistic point of view.</p>
<p>In fact, the freedom we lost in the war of resistance is only false freedom. What we are fighting for with our blood is true freedom—truth. When a nation is under foreign aggression, the entire nation has no freedom to speak of, let alone individual freedom. But precisely because the war of resistance is a struggle for truth, a struggle for the true freedom and survival of the nation, it is the practice of recognizing the category of truth, so the freedom obtained during the war of resistance and at the end is the true freedom of mankind.</p>
<p>Let me give a practical example as evidence for the conclusion of this article: Let us rationally reflect on ourselves, haven't the most important freedom of speech and freedom of thought made amazing progress before and after the war of resistance? This is an iron guarantee that the war of resistance gives us freedom.</p>
<h3>Never Kneel</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>An Ordinary Story</h3>
<p>— Hu Kan</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>When the flood of war was about to spread to Village X, the whole village was greatly disturbed. Everyone tried to avoid this pervasive flood, hoping that this flood would not flow here.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>—Morning! Father Fugeng.</p>
<p>—Morning! Little Duck.</p>
<p>One morning, at the entrance of Bajinzi's house, Father Fugeng and Little Duck met.</p>
<p>—Did you hear it last night? Ah! I was scared to death!</p>
<p>—Where didn't I hear it? I'm afraid the city has already been captured!</p>
<p>The yellow sunlight climbed onto their faces, fully revealing their fear.</p>
<p>At this time, people gathered from all directions, gradually increasing in number. Just like yesterday, they were chatting about the terrifying situation last night, with each person saying a sentence or two.</p>
<p>—We don't need to talk about the past. Now the most important thing is to send someone into the city to inquire about information.</p>
<p>Father Fugeng said angrily.</p>
<p>Little Duck bravely stood up.</p>
<p>—Father Fugeng! Let me go.</p>
<p>—You go? ... We really don't have anyone else, so you go, be careful.</p>
<p>Little Duck stepped forward and left without any hesitation. Everyone's eyes followed him from afar, until his back disappeared behind the sorghum stalks.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Time passed quickly... The sun had already set, but Little Duck was still not to be seen, so everyone began to panic.</p>
<p>—Alas! He hasn't come yet at this time!</p>
<p>Father Fugeng was as anxious as an ant on a hot pot, pacing back and forth in front of the crowd with his hands behind his back. Everyone was silent, silently looking at the distant fields.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>The rumbling sound of cannons still came through the overlapping houses and the wide fields, and sometimes mixed with bursts of rapid machine-gun fire. Flickering starlight flashed at the entrance of Bajinzi's house. From the half-extinguished firelight, a group of dark heads could be seen.</p>
<p>—Father Fugeng! Do you see what's flashing over there in the wheat field?</p>
<p>Sure enough, the black shadow in the wheat field gradually approached. It was not until the dim light of the lantern could illuminate it that it was recognized as Little Duck, whom everyone was looking forward to.</p>
<p>—Little Duck!</p>
<p>—How is it?</p>
<p>—Has the city been lost?</p>
<p>People swarmed up, wrapping Little Duck tightly.</p>
<p>—The city was lost last night….</p>
<p>Little Duck was panting, wiping the sweat from his forehead as he spoke.</p>
<p>—I almost lost my life. Luckily, Rongsheng was there.</p>
<p>—What about that little rascal Rongsheng?</p>
<p>—Father Fugeng! Speak a little lighter, we can't call him a little rascal anymore!</p>
<p>Mentioning Rongsheng, everyone's mind seemed to conjure up that habitual rogue who specialized in robbing things.</p>
<p>—Why?</p>
<p>—Now he's rich. This morning when I entered the city, I was seen by the Japanese, and he said I was some kind of "fried bean." Luckily, Rongsheng was sitting next to the Japanese, saying something, and they released me.... Later, I heard people in the city say that because Rongsheng led the Japanese into the city, they invited him to be the chairman of something. He spoke with a lot of spittle, as if he felt very honored.</p>
<p>—Who cares about him! This traitor, rogue chairman! He can let you go, but he can't let everyone go.</p>
<p>—Hmmm...</p>
<p>Little Duck shrank his head and neck, looking like a plucked duck, unable to speak.</p>
<p>—I knew he would do this. Look how lawless he was?</p>
<p>—That short-lived rascal... everyone said subconsciously.</p>
<p>But some people finally thought of their own village, and a chill ran down their spines:</p>
<p>—If Rongsheng becomes an official, what will happen to our village...</p>
<p>The elderly Father Fugeng was very confused. He couldn't give everyone an idea.</p>
<p>—Hey: Tomorrow we'll go to the city and ask him to tell the Japanese not to come down to the villages to harass us, okay?</p>
<p>(5)</p>
<p>Tomorrow someone brought news from the city that the newly appointed Chairman XX was shot by some "fried bean."</p>
<h3>Surviving Writings from Mount Qi (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yun Jun</p>
<p>—Folk Novel Analysis</p>
<p>The book also pointed out various factors that led to the failure of the resistance at the time, such as the lack of fighting spirit among the officers and generals of the government army, who defended themselves with their troops and fled in panic after a defeat. General Zheng in the fourth chapter and Hu Laigong in the eighth chapter are typical examples of this kind of person. Some even used the pretext of raising troops to create a false appearance, specializing in extorting money and food and robbing the wealth of the people, as recorded in chapters 20, 21, and 23. The people's army, except for Yan Shi's troops, mostly took advantage of the chaos to avenge themselves, resulting in a complete lack of discipline, even killing each other (as recorded in chapters 40 to 43). When faced with war, they either remained stationed and did not move, or dispersed one after another, such as Hu Longguang, who had no intention of defending the city and watched Qing troops attack the city without firing an arrow (chapter 28), and Shi Ziqiu's troops, who scattered completely as soon as they heard the news of the city's fall (chapter 31). Those in charge were either scholars who talked about military affairs without any preparation, such as Jin Bin, who went to Jiangyin's rescue without any prior contact and without any plans during the war (chapter 18); or they seized the opportunity to raise troops without any national identity, such as Shi Ziqiu in chapter 26 and Ling Si in chapter 42. At that time, government officials and gentry did not hesitate to lose face and surrender to the enemy, acting as accomplices, such as Qian Qianyi, Xiao Shien, and Magistrate Ma, who were all used by the enemy one after another. Even those who were responsible for defending the land, such as Cao Yuanfang, fled alone before the city fell. The common people, in addition to seeking to preserve their lives, did not care about the safety of the nation. What is most heartbreaking is that there were even traitors in the people's army who were willing to be guides for the enemy, such as Zhao Botao, who was like Wang Bamei and Xu Hongfa at the time. These are historical relics, but the painful lessons will make us, who were born more than 200 years later, feel indignant!</p>
<p>The entire book seems to revolve around Yan Shi's uprising of local troops, but because there are so many characters and such a complex plot, the status of the main characters has been reduced a lot. The story of Yan Shi is only recorded in five or six chapters, and there are only two instances of him using troops, which clearly loses the unity of the entire book. Furthermore, the war of resistance by Vice Magistrate Yan and the heroic sacrifice of all the people of Jiangyin are both excellent subjects, but the author did not make good use of them. Instead, he only gave a few perfunctory sentences of light description, and instead worked hard to write about the private fights of the people in the countryside and the stories of escaping from death, which occupied a quarter of the entire book (such as chapters 22, 28, 30, 34 to 36, 38, 40 to 43, 50, 51, 53, and 54, a total of 15 chapters), which inevitably reversed the importance of things. The author witnessed the Qing troops' massacre. He should have had some good feelings towards the uprising of the local troops, but he didn't. Instead, he thought it was meddlesome. For example, in chapter 22, Chen Mengli, who dared to speak out, said: "Changshu is only a small place. The Qing Dynasty is powerful. It is better to send someone to negotiate with them and observe their movements. If we start a war rashly, it is like trying to stop a cart with a mantis's arms." In chapter 37, the author himself actually came out and said: "They are all just bamboo spears and wooden sticks, wrapped in white cloth. To fight with the Qing Dynasty is truly like trying to stop a cart with a mantis's arms." This is exactly the same as today's advocates of "weapons only." The author was a person of the Ming Dynasty, so he should have had thoughts about the fallen state of the Ming Dynasty, such as in chapter 55, which records the text being changed to Manchu, there should have been at least some sentiments or the like, but other than "and the customs have also undergone a major change," he said nothing. Finally, he praised the alien rulers and their meritorious dogs: "Since then, General Yang's prestige has become increasingly prominent, and the soldiers on the sea (referring to the soldiers of the Ming Prince Yiyang) dare not invade the territory, and the people have once again enjoyed peace." The author completely forgot about the insane massacre a few months ago! People like Qifeng Qiaodao Ren, who are so willing to live in peace and forgetful, are probably not uncommon now. Perhaps someone would pull him in and consider him a confidant from more than 200 years ago. To avoid this bad influence, it depends on the reader's sense of proportion. In the same series of books, its value is several times lower than "The Painful History."</p>

<h3>A Comparison of the "Four Great Dan Actresses" in Peking Opera (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xuehong Zhaizhu</p>
<p>Peking Opera actors have always been divided into four roles: "Sheng, Dan, Jing, Chou." In the past, there were many talented actors in the Sheng role, and they often performed as the main characters, so they had an extraordinary status. However, since the Republic of China, the Sheng role has gradually declined. The older generation are either old or dead, and very few younger actors have emerged. In addition, Mei Lanfang's sensational performance in the Dan role, followed by the emergence of Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, Shang Xiaoyun, Xu Biyun, and Zhu Qinxin, although the name is still the same as "Sheng, Dan, Jing, Chou," in fact, the status of the Dan role is far above the Sheng role. Among them, Mei Lanfang, Cheng Yanqiu, Xun Huisheng, and Shang Xiaoyun are particularly accomplished, and they have earned the honor of being the "Four Great Dan Actresses" in the Peking Opera world. As for the art of the four of them, various circles have long made their assessments. Now, I will comment on them based on my personal views. If there are any errors, I hope that drama experts will correct them.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang</p>
<p>In the past, he was respected as the "King of the Performing Arts World." After traveling to the United States, he was even awarded the honorary title of "Doctor of Literature." This favored one of heaven is enough to be proud of in the performing arts world. As for his art, he does have many unique features. In addition, his natural talent is sufficient, which has given him a lot of help. Now, let's observe his singing and acting aspects: His voice belongs to the Gong tone, which is broad, bright, and sweet, and very pleasant to listen to. In addition, his speaking and reciting are clear and crisp, and his Beijing dialect is fluent, so it is no wonder that he is so popular. As for his acting, it is graceful and generous, without any procrastination. Moreover, his appearance is delicate and beautiful, and his expressions are subtle. He can understand the plot everywhere, and every move is just right. It is certainly not a coincidence that he is the leader of the Dan role!</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu</p>
<p>The voice is the capital of a singer, and Yanqiu suffers from this capital. However, smart people have their own methods. He abandoned the dead singing without a voice and worked hard on the tune. As a result, he became very popular in this "Cheng tune." It can be seen that everything in the world depends on human effort. Yanqiu's voice belongs to the Shang tone. When he sings, it is as high as a monkey's cry and as fine as a gossamer, which is both sad and moving. In addition, his appearance is pure and beautiful, and his actions are upright, which is most suitable for playing tragic Dan. Moreover, his stage steps are very steady and skillful. It is said that he walks in a T-shape, so his small feet are never exposed outside his skirt. This kind of superb skill is probably not something that ordinary vulgar actors can pay attention to. In addition, his beauty in the running garden scene, his skill with water sleeves, and his deep skill with the buttock pad are all beyond the reach of others. Therefore, Yanqiu is the only one who can compete with Lanfang.</p>
<h3>Recent News from the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— (Qiuwen)</p>
<p>The Twentieth Century Company has decided to produce a full-color historical film with all children as actors in its 1939 new film program. The script is based on the great deeds of King Louis XIII of France. The film is titled "The Red Sable." Minium Mink Company has prepared to use all its efforts to produce the film and participate in the International Film Exhibition held in Paris this autumn. However, child star Shirley Temple will not participate in the film.</p>
<p>After being ordered to close down by Hitler in 1936 for producing anti-fascist films, the German Dengbao Film Company reopened last spring and produced the martial arts film "The Red Knight." Because it was a box office success, it was produced from the first episode to the fifth episode, and the profit reached 5 million marks in mid-October. Recently, it was once again nationalized by the German government. It is now engaged in the production of "Son of the Iron Man." After the film is completed, it will be used as an annual international propaganda exchange item for the Allied countries (naturally Italy and Japan).</p>
<p>Tolstoy's posthumous work "The Dwarf" has been adopted by the British Gaomeng Company as a script, and with the consent of the Soviet government, it will be filmed on location in Russia. Some of the actors are planned to be recruited from Russian film actors. In order to appeal, the Soviet People's Committee will provide practical assistance at that time. It is still the first precedent for the British and Russian film industries to shake hands.</p>
<p>The war newsreel "Madrid and Spain," jointly produced by Paramount, Universal, and United Artists in Spain, has completed 120,000 feet since it began filming and has been shown in the United Kingdom and the United States for as long as seven months. Recently, it was decided to trim and reorganize the newsreel, divide it into two parts, and ship it to various countries in the Far East for public screening this spring. It can go from China to India and other places in March.</p>
<p>In early November last year, US President Roosevelt held a private banquet at his presidential residence for film producers across the country. Roosevelt delivered a speech to the producers at the banquet, hoping that each company would produce more scientific films starting next year to serve as extracurricular reading materials for students. All scripts will be collected by the Ministry of Education and provided free of charge, he said.</p>
<h3>A Record of the "Diao Chan" Vocal Performance</h3>
<p>— Xin Ren</p>
<p>Many literati and artists gathered at the Diao Chan Teahouse the night before for a grand banquet and a vocal performance. The event was hosted by Fan Songfeng and Lu Yifang, who invited guests. At the same time, it was a banquet to introduce Ms. Zhou Meiyan, a Kunqu opera actress, to literary friends.</p>
<p>That night, a grand banquet was held, with many distinguished guests, no fewer than sixty people. Literary and artistic figures such as Ding Muqin, Zhang Xiaoyan, Wu Guanli, Zhou Lianxia, He Zhushi, Chen Lingxi, etc., were all outstanding talents of the time. Female guests: Gu Han, sisters Tan Jinlin, sisters Weng Hongsheng and Yu Ying, Liu Qinxin, Wang Xueyan, Pan Xueqin, Zhu Junpei, etc., were mostly famous artists in the singing world.</p>
<p>At the banquet, wine glasses were exchanged, the atmosphere was lively, and laughter was like pearls. The veteran actor You Yunqing played a melodious flute. First, the host, Fan Songfeng, sang a piece of "Pipa Ji." In the past, he taught at Jinan University and presided over the Kunqu opera lectures for a long time; his performance of famous family tunes was extraordinary, and the whole audience tapped their fingers in time. Ye Yangwu, a famous Kunqu opera amateur, continued with a section from "Making a Scene at School," which was also very good. Zhang Xiaoyan, a famous Peking Opera critic, sang four lines from "Scolding Cao" in the original rhythm, which was accurate in pronunciation and full of Tan's style. Ms. Liu Qinxin's long section of "Farewell My Concubine" imitated Wan Hua and showed great skill. Next, famous Kunqu opera artists Gu Chuanjie and Zhang Fufang took turns playing the flute and singing a section from "Pipa Ji" and "Thinking of the Mortal World," respectively, which was a perfect combination. Ms. Zhou Meiyan and Fan Songfeng and Tang Yunshang sang a section from "Small Banquet" and "Farewell Kiln" each, which were excellent in both Peking Opera and Kunqu Opera. Yu Ru Tang Yunshang's style of Qi Qilin, singing and acting "Chasing Han Xin," Wang Xuechen's dignified "South Tianmen," etc., also had their own merits and won a lot of warm applause.</p>
<p>The gentlemen and ladies who participated in this grand event each prepared a gift to present to Ms. Meiyan to show their encouragement and to help her enjoy the elegant atmosphere. For a time, they were displayed all over the table, with all kinds of items, which were beautiful. Ms. Zhou Lianxia specially painted a pine and plum blossom frame and inscribed it with the following short sentences: "Since making a home with the green pine, shadows slant in the incense of the jade furnace, rouge is used to dye the pen that pities talent, carefully writing the first flower of the east wind." The three arts of poetry, calligraphy, and painting were combined, which added even more color.</p>
<p>The vocal performance was lively enough.</p>

<p>The banquet ended near ten o'clock, and it was indeed an unusual grand elegant gathering.</p>

<h3>Xia Peizhen Stops Returning to Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Mu Mu</p>
<p>Three Theaters in Beiping Compete to Hire Her</p>
<p>Xia Peizhen, with the "Kuide Society" drama troupe, performed at the Beiyang Theater in Tianjin. It is said that the results were not very good, and Xia Peizhen also resigned from the troupe due to her weak body and inability to adapt to the local climate. She will sell off and return to Shanghai. This matter was recorded in the newspaper on the 15th. Yesterday, someone close to Xia Peizhen returned to Shanghai from Tianjin and talked about it, saying that the so-called inability to adapt to the local climate was all false. The poor attendance was a fact. At first, she sold 70-80% of the tickets, but then it gradually declined. On the most miserable day, there were only 22 tickets. The highest ticket price was 70 cents, how could that be enough for expenses? Xia Peizhen did not adopt a revenue-sharing system but took a monthly salary, but under these circumstances, there was also a sigh of "it is difficult to continue," so she had to use her inability to adapt to the local climate and her body as an excuse to resign from the troupe. At the same time, the "Qing Le," "San Qing," and "Kai Ming" theaters in Beiping heard this news and believed that Xia Peizhen had performed a free play in a certain entertainment center in Beiping when she came to Beiping with the Mingxing Company to film "The Love Story of Laughter," and the magic power was quite great. This time, hearing that she was going back to Shanghai, they believed that the opportunity was no longer there, so they each sent people to Tianjin to contact her and asked her to perform in a short-term performance on the first day of the Lunar New Year. After leaving Tianjin, there is plenty of time to rest, and the box office of the Lunar New Year will not be bad, not to mention it is a short-term performance. They are currently proceeding separately, and I don't know who will "get there first." It seems that Xia Peizhen will not return to Shanghai for the time being.</p>
<h3>News from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>The first day of charity performance by the Shanghai Performing Arts Association was held at the Ling Gong Stage yesterday. The attendance was full, and the situation was very grand. The performances of the actors were very wonderful. Zhou Xinfang arrived backstage early. Lin Shusen and Zhang Wenqin finished performing the play "Jiang Duo Dou" and chatted with Zhou for a long time, calling Zhou the leader of the performing arts world and unanimously supporting him.</p>
<p>The rehearsal of "Five Books of Zhang Guolao" at the Tianchan Stage is scheduled to begin on the 23rd (next Monday). It will be directed by Zhang Defu, the director of the play. The content includes the three plays "White Peony" and "Chopping the Vine Bridge," which are quite wonderful. The roles are assigned to Xiao San Mazi as Lu Dongbin and Xue Youqin as White Peony.</p>

<p>Opening Method Sixth Game</p>
<p>Black First</p>
<p>Screen Horse vs. Center Cannon (Straight Chariot Method)</p>
<p>Explanation of Moves</p>
<p>Chariot Two Advances Six or Advances Four are both official moves, but the intentions are different. Advancing Four is not aimed at charging forward, so it seems not as effective as directly Advancing Six for attacking the center. Pawn Five Advances One attacks the guard, Guard Four Advances Five covers, Cannon Two Advances One is a key move, which can resist the pressure of Chariot Two Advances Six. Pawn Five Advances One sends the pawn. Whoever wants to attack the center must first send out the center pawn, and then borrow strength to send out the horse. Chariot Two Moves Three to catch both seems to gain the initiative on the surface, but in fact it loses the initiative. This is called a false initiative. Horse Seven Advances Five to capture the chariot. If the chariot retreats at this time, there is still no major problem. Cannon Five Advances Four is a move that loses overall effectiveness and weakens the momentum. Chariot Two Moves Three, change to Chariot Two Retreats Two. Although retreating the chariot is also an official move, Cannon Eight Advances Two protects the center, Horse Seven Advances Five forms a pinning horse cannon attack, Soldier Seven Advances One forms a screen horse defense.</p>
<h3>Art Forest Weekly Theater</h3>
<p>Second Performance</p>
<p>After the performance of the three famous plays "Red Lantern," "Executioner," and "Third Master Liu" by the Art Forest Weekly Theater last Sunday, it received good reviews from the audience. The prosperity of the attendance broke the record of the previous Weekly Theater.</p>
<p>It is heard that the theater will still be held at the Carlton Theater this Sunday (22nd) morning. The names of the plays are (1) "Bright Moon Rises in the East" (written by Mrs. Arlai) (2) "Seeking Marriage" (written by Chen Baichen) (3) "People Riding Horses to the Sea" (translated by Tian Han). The three major plays have been rehearsed for three weeks. The director is a famous person in Shanghai. A string orchestra will participate in the accompaniment this time, conducted by Zhang Zhengfan. Those who love drama should not miss this good opportunity.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City and the Pear Garden in the Former Capital (80)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Cui Ruisen Suffered Beatings from Fu Ying and His Descendants for Three Generations</p>
<p>To play the role of a "teacher master," the first requirement is to perfectly imitate the demeanor of one who bullies the villagers by relying on the power of others (to put it elegantly, leveraging influence like a fox). Only then can one add color to the play. Wang Shuanzi had a thin, long braid coiled into a circle on his head, two patches of headache plaster on his temples, a long robe half-buttoned and half-tucked, a metal health ball rolling in his palm. When he appeared on stage, he held his head high, pushed his stomach out far, furrowed his brow, and stretched his mouth wide, moving sideways like a crab to the edge of the stage. His expression made everyone laugh. Moreover, this old fellow was a versatile performer, adept in both martial and comedic roles. His boxing stances were indeed proper, and his recitation of the names of the Grand Hong Fist, Second Hong Fist, and the eighteen weapons was clear and fluent. As for the crispness and brightness of his voice, no one could match it.</p>
<p>Cui Ruisen's performance, though not excellent, was still passable. He had even performed with the elder Tan in the past. Several years ago, when Fu Ying performed "Killing the Fishing Family" at the Kai Ming Theater in the foreign concession, Wang Youqing played the role of Guiying. I had the opportunity to watch it. Cui Ruisen was almost sixty years old then, and the weather was very cold. When he played the teacher master being beaten and scolded by Xiao En, he half-seriously, half-playfully took advantage of his age and seniority to say to Fu Ying: "Your Tan family has really bullied me, Cui, thoroughly! Your grandfather started beating me, and I didn't mind that. But how can you call me 'Second Uncle'? The more I associate with your Tan family, the lower my seniority becomes!" Before he could finish his sentence, Guiying's board struck his buttocks. Ruisen then said to Youqing: "My buttocks are used to being beaten by your grandfather. Fine, I'll go find Wang Yaoqing to settle the score!" (Note: Youqing inherited Yaoqing's role; Yaoqing used to play Guiying opposite the elder Tan).</p>

<p>Anecdotes from the World of Medicine</p>
<h3>Always Maintaining an Authoritative Position. What is the Reason? It is Because: Proven Through Difficult Animal Experiments (This is an Advertisement)</h3>
<p>— Written by Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Faculty of the Russian Labor University</p>
<h3>Testicular Endocrine Can Indeed Save from Premature Aging</h3>
<p>That humans cannot live forever is indeed regrettable. However, the progress of medical science today is advancing rapidly. Although research on the art of immortality has not yet matured, a method for preventing premature aging in humans has already been discovered.</p>
<p>Among all anti-aging remedies, the most noteworthy is the testicular endocrinology advocated by Dr. Meulen. Dr. Meulen first conducted experiments on white rabbits. When white rabbits reach about five years of age, their bodies begin to decline, their appetite decreases, they walk with difficulty, and their fur becomes sparse, showing a state of weakness. At this time, he extracted the essence of the testicles of young animals and fed it to them. As a result, their spirit recovered and became lively, their appetite increased, their fur became shiny and dense, and their health was restored, thus achieving the goal of returning to youth.</p>
<p>Based on the same principle, this research developed rapidly. As a result, it was decided to extract large amounts of endocrine from the testicles of chimpanzees, cattle, and sheep, and to incorporate ingredients beneficial to the human body such as minerals and plants, to create the drug PANticome (Buti Kang). It has achieved very great success in treating premature aging.</p>
<p>Premature aging in the human body is entirely caused by excessive indulgence and violation of physiological life, such as excessive licentiousness, excessive labor, addiction to masturbation, or nocturnal emissions. The symptoms include pale complexion, listlessness, muscle wasting, frequent feelings of heaviness and headache, palpitations, night sweats, and insomnia and forgetfulness.</p>
<p>If a patient with premature aging is treated with the testicular endocrine agent "Buti Kang," it can certainly cure the patient. However, if the lifestyle is not brought back to normal and one continues to be licentious and masturbate, it will still be ineffective.</p>
<p>"Buti Kang" is a metabolic agent that is especially beneficial for the elderly. After prolonged use, it does indeed have the effect of restoring youth. Women can also take "Buti Kang."</p>
<p>The white rabbit in the picture above had already lost its fur and was extremely aged. After being fed with testicular endocrine by the German physiologist Dr. Meulen, its spirit became lively and its appetite increased. Its full and shiny fur is sufficient proof of the omnipotence of medicine.</p>
<h3>The Perilous Signs of Increased Frequency of Nocturnal Emissions</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany</p>
<p>Although nocturnal emissions are harmful, if the frequency is not high, or only occurs once a month, it may not be necessary to treat it. However, if the frequency gradually increases, the essence and blood will be depleted, the function of metabolism will gradually decline, and as a result, the brain nerves, sexual nerves, and spinal cord will be greatly damaged. All the symptoms of weakness will then arise.</p>
<p>After the frequency of nocturnal emissions increases, one can quickly perform local cold water friction and take French "Neris Nocturnal Emission Pills" to stop it. The "Neris Nocturnal Emission Pills" also have the effect of calming the brain nerves, and are very effective for treating insomnia. The thoroughness of its medicinal power is indeed unmatched by similar preparations. In the event that nocturnal emissions have already caused neurasthenia, sexual dysfunction, and back pain, taking the animal testicular essence preparation "Buti Kang" daily is very effective. In addition, electrotherapy and injections are also effective treatments for the above symptoms, but their efficacy is not as good as actively taking "Buti Kang." Because "Buti Kang" contains three ingredients, it does indeed have the three major functions of nourishing the brain, nourishing the kidneys, and nourishing the blood, so it can gain the trust of doctors, and is recommended as the best among endocrine agents.</p>
<p>Modern Medicine</p>
<h3>The Husband After Contracting Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine from the United States</p>
<p>Marital love is often destroyed by leukorrhea.</p>
<p>Married men and women must be cured quickly.</p>
<p>After contracting leukorrhea, one must pay close attention to the development of gonorrhea. There are two reasons for this: one is to ensure the safety of one's own illness, and the other is to prevent the wife from contracting leukorrhea. However, these two conditions have a profound contradiction. Because if leukorrhea is not cured in a short period of time, it will inevitably turn into a chronic condition. Once it becomes chronic, if a good treatment method is still not obtained, one must lead a long-term life of abstinence. Mentally, one cannot avoid becoming depressed or overly excited. However, if one is married, it is often difficult to live a monastic life of abstinence due to environmental reasons. As a result, the wife will inevitably be poisoned.</p>
<p>According to statistics from various medical experts, among venereal disease patients, gonorrhea is the most common, and those who become infertile due to venereal disease are also mostly gonorrhea patients. This is especially important for husbands who have contracted leukorrhea to pay attention to. Originally, gonorrhea is extremely difficult to cure. If one indiscriminately takes medicines on the market that claim to be able to eradicate the disease in three to five days, or if the ingredients of the medicine are still very old but are given a new name, the so-called "changing the soup but not the medicine" refers to this type of trickery. And the result is not only not effective at all, but the gonococci penetrate deep into the internal tissues and blood from the local urethral mucosa of the urethra. When a man contracts gonorrhea, the testicles are damaged. When a woman contracts gonorrhea, the ovaries are destroyed. Therefore, the vas deferens and fallopian tubes of men and women are destroyed and cannot perform reproductive work, resulting in a tragic situation for the couple. To save this kind of pain, only "Klinon," invented by a German gonorrhea expert, can do the job. Because "Klinon" has the effect of resisting gonococcal bacteriophages, its eradication of gonococci adopts a surrounding method. Therefore, gonorrhea that has been cured after taking "Klinon" has never recurred. This is the unique efficacy of "Klinon" in treating gonorrhea. All men, whether married or unmarried, can only take "Klinon" to have no regrets.</p>
<h3>A Warning to Those Suffering from Lung Disease!</h3>
<p>— Doctor Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>If a lung disease patient suddenly experiences hemoptysis or blood in the sputum, the patient and their family will be greatly shocked, thinking that their life is hanging by a thread. In fact, although there are many dangers, if the patient can remain calm and composed, and wholeheartedly trust the doctor's diagnosis and treatment, the danger can be turned into safety. In fact, lung disease relies entirely on appropriate treatment, and taking the lung disease specific medicine "Bu Fei Na Er" internally will definitely have excellent results.</p>
<p>Originally, this preparation is made by collecting the main ingredients for killing Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It can eradicate all pulmonary tuberculosis, promote appetite, and invigorate the body's metabolic functions, so it has great efficacy in treating colds, whooping cough, and senile phlegm and asthma.</p>
<h3>Self-Treatment for Stomach Problems</h3>
<p>When people have stomach problems, all nutrition deteriorates, such as vomiting, acid reflux, loss of appetite, and severe pain. To seek a radical cure, it is advisable to modify the stomach function. Gastric disease can be cured well, and the world has proven that it can be radically cured in a short period of time (available in Asia, Chinese and Western pharmacies).</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Lecture</p>
<p>— Stated by Doctor Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<h3>What Method Can Cure Cystitis?</h3>
<p>Changes in Symptoms: The inflammation of gonorrhea most easily invades the inner urethral opening from the posterior urethra, and affects the adjacent bladder mucosa, and further invades the remaining bladder parts, thus causing cystitis. Patients feel frequent urination. Pain when urinating and turbid urine, high fever, and loss of appetite. General discomfort. Only those who suffer from pure acute cystitis urinate once every one or two hours, or even once every two or three minutes, so they cannot sleep peacefully at night, resulting in insomnia and unbearable suffering. In addition, the upper part of the pubis and the perineum also feel pain, especially after putting suffering powder into the urethra. The pain of cystitis is not limited to this. Often after urinating, it is followed by blood drops. This blood drop is called Terminal Haematurie, so the treatment of this disease should never be local therapy. For example, a ready-made medicine that claims to cure the disease in three to five days will not work, because the scope of this cystitis is very large, and the gonococci have scattered in all directions, so it is difficult to eliminate them in one place.</p>
<p>Effective Treatment: After years of careful exploration of various treatments for cystitis, I know that this disease can only be treated with oral "Klinon" to stimulate the body's cells and produce an anti-gonococcal toxin to phagocytize gonococci and then eliminate inflammation, reduce swelling, and promote diuresis. On the one hand, agile surgery is adopted, and German static electricity therapy and X-ray electrotherapy are used in conjunction to exert the power of destruction. Then acute gonorrhea can be cured in two or three weeks, and chronic gonorrhea can be completely cured within five weeks.</p>
<p>Clinic hours are from 10:00 am to 6:00 pm. From today onwards, 20 patients are sent to the clinic every day, and each number only costs 5 jiao.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Three Poisons</h3>
<p>— Yan Gong</p>
<p>Someone said: "Wherever the Japanese flag goes, the spread of drugs closely follows." These so-called drugs, of course, only refer to opium, morphine, heroin… and so on. In fact, under the cover of the rising sun flag, is there any place that is not filled with opium dens, gambling dens everywhere, and brothels everywhere? One can say that the three poisons are all present.</p>
<p>"Opium dens," "gambling dens," and brothels represent the local prosperity, and are also the easiest way to extract wealth. But in reality, the greatest and highest achievement lies in destroying the national consciousness and lofty aspirations of the general public; and in creating the degenerate concept of shamelessness and lack of integrity in the general public. To the extreme, it can make demons and beasts everywhere. Then those self-proclaimed masters will drive and employ them at will, and no one will resist anymore, and no one will have the strength to resist anymore. The plan is indeed extremely brilliant! Extremely evil! Extremely poisonous!</p>
<p>In order to promote the three-poison policy, the so-called puppet regime also obeys orders respectfully, and in fact uses this as the only way to support themselves. Recently, a report载:"The Wen Shui County Office of Jin Province issued an instruction, the first character number, ordering the village chief and deputy of Nanxian Village. Regarding the instruction, it was found that the brothel in Hejia Alley in the city was originally set up to maintain good people... Recently, by order of the Imperial Army, the number of people must be increased within three days. There is no other way. It is now stipulated that in addition to the selection and delivery from the city gate, each village with more than 300 households shall select and deliver one prostitute, with the standard of being around 20 years old, having no diseases, and being quite attractive. It must be sent to the county within the fastest time for inspection and acceptance. All treatments are provided by the Maintenance Association for each person per month with 50 catties of flour, 5 sheng of millet, 2 catties of kerosene, and more than 100 catties of black charcoal, and one ocean yuan is given to one person at a time... The matter is urgent and must be handled quickly. If there is any delay, I am afraid there will be inconveniences. Do not neglect it, the knowledge of the matter, Song Yuying." This is truly an unprecedented and wonderful instruction, and it is also an immortal achievement of the pseudo-government under the pseudo-public office.</p>
<p>Naturally, in the near future, the puppet government can also create several public "opium dens," "gambling dens," and "brothels," and instruct all villages and towns to promote them universally. Then the "three poisons" will be successful, and demons and beasts will be very happy.</p>
<h3>Old Stamp Market</h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>If you walk south on Henan Road, this bookstore street, after passing the two major bookstores, Zhonghua and Commercial Press, you will see many old stamp stalls along the side of the road. A glass frame contains many old stamps, and several stamp albums are piled on the ground below. If a customer walks over, the person running the stamp stall will pick up the stamp album and let you choose. After bargaining, perhaps a deal will be made.</p>
<p>Originally, in this city of Shanghai, people who run stamp stalls are scattered on various roads and are not concentrated. There are not many people doing this business either. For some reason, the gunfire of January 28, 1932, actually made these people who run stamp stalls concentrate on Henan Road, and the number of people also seems to have increased. Perhaps many unemployed people are also using this business of selling old stamps to maintain their lives during this difficult time. In addition to Henan Road, there are also several stores selling old stamps on Jing'an Temple Road, Avenue Edward VII, and Avenue Joffre, but most of them are operated by foreigners, and the customers are of course mostly blue-eyed and yellow-haired.</p>
<p>We know that in European and American countries, many people like to collect old stamps. Even among kings and presidents, there are many who have a passion for stamp collecting. The late British Emperor George V loved stamp collecting the most, and the current US President Roosevelt also collects many stamps in his residence in Hyde Park. In addition, people from all walks of life, including business and academia, also like stamp collecting. As for the Chinese, they have never been very interested in stamp collecting, but in recent years, many people in Shanghai have suddenly become fond of collecting stamps, especially young students, and there are also many elementary school students. As a result, as the number of stamp collectors increases, the number of people selling stamps also increases day by day.</p>
<p>Because most of the stamp collectors are young students, the stamp market is concentrated on Henan Road, because most of the students often enter and exit Henan Road, buying books and stationery from Commercial Press, Zhonghua, or other bookstores, and then casually look at the stamp stalls. If they find a stamp they like, they buy a few back and paste them on their albums. Sometimes we can see young students or elementary school students taking a few stamps as samples and going to the stamp stalls one by one to match a complete set. However, most of the stamps that can be seen on Henan Road are common. There are not many rare ones. The price of each stamp is a few cents for the low ones, a few jiao for the expensive ones, and there are not many that are above a few yuan. Thinking of the overseas stamp market, a rare stamp can be worth tens of thousands of yuan, which is truly like a small wizard meeting a great wizard.</p>
<p>Since there are so many stamp stalls, where do these many old stamps come from? This is also a matter of interest. As far as I know, there are people who tear off the stamps from letters and take them to these stalls to sell. Among them, especially the Westerners in foreign firms are the majority, because they have the opportunity to collect envelopes in the wastepaper baskets and sell the foreign stamps one by one for money. The people who run the stamp stalls buy them, and after some sorting, they determine which one is valuable and which one is not. Those that are the same are arranged into complete sets and pasted on the albums, and then sold to customers for a few cents or a few jiao each, or a few yuan a set. Wholesale in, retail out, as long as someone comes to buy, of course you can make a lot of money. It is just that you must have a considerable understanding of old stamps, so as not to sell rare stamps at a low price without realizing it.</p>
<h3>Hunting for Old Books</h3>
<p>— Ciyun</p>
<p>After the August 13th War of Resistance broke out, books suffered another great "劫 (robbery)". Not only were precious cultural heritages subjected to the "friendly" grace, but even more regrettably, they were cremated. Other complete volumes were scattered in pieces, and thus lost their original value. This is so regrettable! Therefore, assuming that someone who understands a little about ancient books can occasionally discover a rare or out-of-print book in the old book piles, and thus collect a part or several parts of ancient books, that would also be fulfilling a national duty in the work of preserving national essence. Although the national essence has qualitative advantages and disadvantages, we cannot let people take it privately to prop up their reputation.</p>
<p>Gunfire is diffuse in the sky above Shanghai, along the south side of the Suzhou Creek, by the Pontoon Bridge and the New Gate Road Bridge, many old book stalls are deployed in piles here and there along the road. Old goods stalls are filled with various kinds of books, Western-style, ancient-style, paper-bound, book covers; sizes of 16mo, 32mo, 64mo; English, Chinese, illustrated, literary, theoretical, translated, all kinds of content. These are mostly stolen from various bookstores, so the prices are still cheap.</p>
<p>In recent years, many newly emerging old bookstores and stalls have opened. The Culture Street, which has always been known for buying new books, has seen its book sales affected by various reasons since the start of the War of Resistance. Some bookstores have either shrunk their storefronts or moved inland to seek development. Therefore, it is the newly emerging old book stalls that are supporting the scene on the Culture Street. At one time, the Culture Street had a trend of one stall every ten steps. Recently, it has been reduced, probably to avoid obstructing the sidewalk. Several stall owners have gathered capital and jointly operate a half or one-room bookstore.</p>
<p>Around the area of Carter Road and Avenue Edward VII, old book stalls are scattered on the side of the road. Since the war, this place has become a concentration of large, medium and small schools, so business can really be done, especially during the school season, when students from various schools compete to buy textbooks. Since textbooks have been increased by 30% across the board due to the high cost of paper, textbooks on old book stalls have a trend of not being able to be found quickly.</p>
<p>The tastes of people who hunt for old books have changed with each passing year. Since the War of Resistance, books on social sciences have sold much better, which is a good phenomenon that should exist. Young people are making efforts to choose the most urgent and powerful field of knowledge.</p>
<p>Someone is willing to buy a copy of "Popular Political Economy" at a 30% discount, and a copy of "Lectures on Political Economy" with a torn cover for 8 jiao. Haggling is not business, books that are popular among these young people will not be cheap. Other old editions of "Iron Flow" and "Coal King", out-of-print "Cement" "Armored Train" "Destruction" these books are sold at the marked price; a book translated by Lu Xun and written by Karlsky "On Art", it is said that this book was initially banned. Except for the recent collection in the "Complete Works of Lu Xun", the original separate edition is not common. Someone bought it for a few cents; Engels' "Private Property and the Origin of the State", there are many people who want to find this book, but it is not easy to find on the market. Books about Shui Mo Bookstore are easy to find in the book piles. Shui Mo Bookstore was opened between 1929 and 1930, and its output of books was relatively advanced.</p>
<p>Some friends who run old bookstores use the service section of various newspapers to make non-expensive advertisements, publishing the catalog of his books. This facilitates people who hunt for books and saves time, and you can call him to deliver the books, the price is about the same. With this kind of relationship, he often brings books to your door for you to choose the books you love. If you entrust him to find books, he can also help you, which can save effort.</p>
<h3>Street Artists (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>Embroidery: The main product sold by embroiderers is patterns embroidered with specially made thread and needles. The second is needles and thread. This specially made needle has a thread connected to one end, and a sharp hook at the other end. According to the pattern lines drawn on the cloth surface, it is sequentially passed through. Because the needle is pulled out, the end with the sharp hook will have a hooking effect. Therefore, the thread on the cloth surface can be inserted with a needle, and at the same time it can be pulled up from below, interacting with each other to form a pattern. It is said that large-format hanging scrolls can be embroidered; the daily income is also quite considerable.</p>
<p>Cutting Patterns: This is also a business mainly aimed at women. These patterns are mostly used on shoe uppers, handkerchiefs, and children's bibs. They are various flower and bird patterns made of white paper. Although the price is low, the daily income is 7 or 8 jiao. Skilled technicians can cut this kind of pattern without using a mold. A pair of scissors can twist a few twists on white paper to make a pattern. Those who are ingenious also have "aviation to save the country" patterns for sale now.</p>
<p>In addition, engraving seals, selling songs, and blowing sugar bubbles are also tricks to exchange skills for food on the street. However, these arts are not limited to the street, so they are omitted. Unemployed friends! Remember: If you have a skill, you won't starve. Go ahead and strive to be a lucky one in the tide of unemployment! "The End"</p>
<h3>Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later</h3>
<p>— Ruhua</p>
<p>Produced by Xinhua Film Company, shown at the Jin Cheng Grand Theatre</p>
<p>A long, long time ago, I watched an American film "Just Imagine," which was an ideal film like "Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later." I can't completely remember the story, it seems that the new world fifty years later has developed to a new level, such as humans have abolished names and are called No, A, or B... Houses are high-rise buildings of dozens of floors, private airships are as numerous as cars are now, and food has been made into pills... Finally, it seems to be traveling to the moon, using photographic techniques to present the strange and bizarre new world to the audience.</p>
<p>Science is progressing day by day, and some parts of the "assumptions" in "Just Imagine" may be possible. However, because it is a fun film, it is inevitable to follow the "assumptions" of the screenwriter, and relying on superior equipment, it was made into such a sensational film.</p>
<p>"Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later" also has similar points, such as the free movement of airships, mechanical haircuts, psychological testing instruments, and even the ability to dominate the wind, rain, thunder, and lightning of nature.</p>
<p>The equipment of Chinese studios is naturally far inferior to that of Hollywood, so of course it cannot be compared with "Just Imagine." However, "Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later" was still completed before the war, otherwise even such a large scene would not be possible.</p>
<p>The script is slightly loose, and Han Lan Gen and Liu Jiqun's fear of their wives is too old-fashioned.</p>
<p>In short, "Shanghai Bund Sixty Years Later" is just a fun film.</p>
<h3>Rain Clears to Blue Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Engineer Lin Ingeniously Explains Standardization, Director Jin Eloquently Discusses Equality</p>
<p>Miss Jin said, "Is it really possible for someone to enter the wrong room?" Lin Jiancheng said, "Because the layout of each floor is the same. When stepping out of the elevator, it's hard to tell which floor it is. I heard a story about a worker, a bachelor, who lived in room 14 on the fifth floor. Room 14 is very close to the elevator, just around the corner. One day after work, he had a few drinks somewhere and came back. He intended to return to his own room, but when the elevator stopped on the fourth floor, he mistakenly thought he was on the fifth. Stepping out of the elevator, the direction of room 14 was the same, and when he opened the door, the furnishings inside were very similar. Without thinking twice, he jumped into bed and began to snore loudly. When the owner of room 14 on the fourth floor returned, a newly married couple, they were surprised to find someone asleep on their bed. They pulled him up, but he was still confused, mistaking them for friends visiting him, and said in his sleep: 'Please sit down! Please sit down! Where did you good people come from!' Isn't that a perfect example of a standardization joke?" Lin Jiancheng's words made the two He sisters laugh uncontrollably. Miss Jin said, "There's a loophole in your story." Lin Jiancheng asked, "What loophole?" Miss Jin said, "Room 14 on the fourth floor and room 14 on the fifth floor would naturally have locks on their doors, and they would certainly lock them when they left. How could someone just casually push the door open and enter?" Lin Jiancheng said, "If I may add another point, that's also related to standardization. There are four or five hundred rooms in this building, and naturally all four or five hundred rooms have locks, but it's inevitable that some keys will be the same. Who knows if the keys to room 14 on the fourth floor and room 14 on the fifth floor are the same? Furthermore, the morals of the workers these days are much higher than before. It's common for them not to lock their doors. Look at those who live in large communal rooms, with many people living together, how can they lock their doors?" Just as they were talking, they arrived at the martyrs' cemetery. From afar, they could see a large white stone memorial archway with the four green characters "碧血丹心" [Loyal Hearts Shed Crimson Blood]. Looking through the archway, they saw that both sides of the path were lined with pine and cypress trees, which, although not very tall, already presented a verdant sight. This place was once used as an airfield during the war. Now, however, there was a small market, which thrived on the proximity of the martyrs' cemetery. Because people new to Shanghai often come here to pay their respects to the martyrs, and especially during the spring and autumn, many people come here for outings. (17)</p>
