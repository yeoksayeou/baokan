<p>倫敦　英國駐德大使漢德森、業已携帶張伯倫首相私人函件、前往貝許德斯伽登鎭晋謁希特勒元首、此間政界人士咸謂、此函內容、乃係一種堅決的警吿、略謂德國倘有事於波蘭、定必引起極大的影響、「神經戰爭」則於英國無關係云、此外、英國內閣聞巳決定禁止某某種原料品出口、職是之故、德國近在倫教所購之樹膠棉花與銅、恐難運往德國矣、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　外間所傳德軍已奉命於明日拂曉佔領但澤與波蘭遊廊之謠言、今日此間予以吾認、負責方面皆未聞有此計畫、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　德國人士現料德外長里賓特羅甫抵莫斯科後、新發展將接踵而來、以爲德蘇互不侵犯條的之成立與簽字、僅爲數小時內事、迨簽的後、德國將迅速施展其以後步驟、依彼等意見、星期四日將爲歐洲史中之重要日期、蓋德軍現已有積極準備、可隨時出動也、德國官塲不允預測未來事、惟消息靈通之德國政界中人則以爲德國欲重行佔領歐戰前所有之領土、現雖有瓜分波蘭之說、然消息最靈通之方面、則預料獨立的波蘭國仍將存在、而獲有通過但澤與吉第尼亞以達海口、俾利商業之擔保、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>巴黎　據此間所接消息聲稱、德國軍隊在各處集中、將於三四日內吿畢、屆時倘希特勒總理下令進攻、德軍卽當向波蘭攻繫、（二十三日美聯電）</p>
<p>柏林　國社黨中之曾預言奧捷命運者、昨晚謂今日之波蘭、業已「終了」、波蘭之將來、全視希特勒之意志而定、若波蘭能接受德國條件、則德國將僅要回戰前德國屬地、若波蘭拒絕、則德軍將直搗華沙、德後備軍皆被召入伍、此可表現希特勒收復失地之決心、歐洲之緊張局勢、將於德外長里賓特洛甫簽訂蘇德互不侵犯條的時達最高潮、德人仍盼此决危機、能若去年捷克事件獲得同一解决、蘇聯之中立與德軍戰略上之優勢、將使波繭不敢抵抗、而引誘英法使用和平方法解决但澤與走廊問題、此間各方人士皆望蘇德互不侵犯條的、能再進一步而互締軍事同盟、此蘇德互不侵犯條的無疑的已予英法一大打擊、英法蘇三國軍事協的將無從締結、（二十三美聯電）</p>
<p>但澤　國社黨方而今日預言但澤將於本星期杪前歸還德國、此間國社黨領袖首次發表但澤與德國重行合併日期、極可注意、某一國社黨領袖聲稱、「余信在五日內、必有所行動」多數國社黨員相信、德國俟蘇德互不侵犯條約在莫斯科簽訂後、即將重佔但澤、（二十三日美聯電）</p>
<p>華沙　頃據官方消息、德蘇兩國雖欲簽訂互不侵犯條約、但波蘭仍當以全力抵抗侵略、又波蘭官塲人士認德蘇兩國之舉動、乃係「國際紙牌競賽中之意外砲竹聲」、據波蘭方面消息、波蘭索來不願獲得蘇聯之軍事援助、蓋蘇軍進入波蘭以後，其對波之威脅、實與侵佔領土之德軍相等、至於波蘭對蘇聯之企求、僅限於經濟援助而已、（二十三日美聯電）</p>
<p>華沙　波蘭邊界近日積極進行軍事準備、上西里西亞威衛資·斯特拉托夫各區、波蘭軍隊均積極趕築工事、與德疆接近之各公路已挖成壕溝、所有橋梁概已炸毀、（二十三日海通電）</p>
<h3>英閣會議決定　採取緊急措施　非常國會定今日召集　將要求全權應付時艱</h3>
<p>倫敦　英內閣昨開全體會議、歷時頗久、晚間發出正式宣佈英、內閣已决定德蘇任何互不侵犯條約、皆毫不影響其對波蘭之義務云、英國會定明日復開、屆時兩院將通過緊急權力防務案、俾央國得處於時局需要時、立即採行任何必要計畫之地位、目前英國正布置戒備辦法、如海陸空軍若干人員等之徵集是、同時叉設法處理重要原料與貨物由英國輪出事、據官場宣布、德波間之爭執、未有可許施用武力致釀成歐洲戰爭之處、而歐洲亦未有不可於恢復信任時和平解决之問題、英政府始終準備以造成此種狀况、但若英國雖致力於此、而他國仍主張施用武力、則英國有抵抗到底準備與決心云、英內閣會議至午後五時二十分始畢、計歷三小時又二十分鐘之久、各閣員在離唐寗街十號　邸時、皆有愉快之象、門外羣衆對各閣員皆大聲歡呼、而對於海陸空大臣則歡呼允形熱烈、聞外部在內閣集議以前、終日有外交上活動、外相哈哈立法克斯文與外部常次賈德幹、於午前十一時半往見首相張伯倫、未幾外部首席外交顧問文西泰亦詣相邸、、午後一時十分哈立法克斯與賈德幹始辭出、德國駐英代辦柯爾德午後一時到英外部有所接洽、而日大使亦於午後五時到外部、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　明日召開國會之各種準備、現已完成、昨夜廣播無綫電臺已在本國節目之新聞中、發出召集國會議員前來倫敦開會之通吿、國會定明日午後一時三刻起開會、將於時局緊張之際繼續集會、聞政府將請國會於一日內將緊急權力國防案完全通過、俾政府有權得採行任何步驟以應付時艱、並於必要時、有隨時行事無須商諸國會之權、此案通過後、英政府將處於與法政府同樣之地位、蓋法政府現有幾等於獨裁之政權也、換言之、即上决大戰時國會所通過各種計畫之國防法案、將復施於今後是已、按此法案、軍法處得審訊並懲治遠反戰時維持公安與國防條例者、而海陸軍行政會得收用製造軍火或</p>
<h3>德外長率隨員　昨午抵莫斯科　商締不侵犯條約　建設和平為基礎</h3>
<p>莫斯科　德外長里賓特羅甫及其隨員已於本日午後一時抵此、蘇聯外决波丹金·及國際貿易副委員長鐵八諾夫·莫斯科警備司令·莫斯科市政府代表等、均到飛機塲歡迎、德大使館全部人員及義駐蘇大使亦均前往恭迓、（二十三日海通社電）</p>

<p>柏林　據消息靈通者稱、德外長此决赴莫斯科、不僅簽署德蘇互不侵犯條的、並將與蘇聯議定兩國彼此之利益範圍、又稱、談判之時、德方將以坦白誠懇之熊度、與蘇方交換意見、德國之目的、極爲正大和平、德國所希冀者無他、建設和平與友誼的關係之基礎是也、（二十海通電）</p>
<p>柏林　日駐德大使大島昨晚會於德外長里賓特羅甫起程赴莫斯科前、作半小時之晤談、聞對於在提議中之德蘇協定及防共公的之未來有所探詢、（二十三日路透社電）軍用品工廠之全部或一部出產、並得接收此種工廠、（二十三日路透社電）</p>

<h3>德蘇公約　內容推測</h3>
<p>巴黎　德蘇兩國所商訂之互不侵犯條的、內容如何、尙不可知、此間外交界人士均不願表示意見、僅謂就法理觀點而論、德蘇兩國關係、未必因互不侵犯條的而有顯著的變更、緣各該國曾於一九二二年四月十四日簽訂拉巴羅條的、解決雙方經濟關係、厥後復於一九二六年四月廿二日簽訂柏林條約、亦即友好中立條約、其第二條規定簽的國一方雖態度和平、若仍被第三國攻擊、則其他一方應保守中立、第三條規定第三國倘若組織經濟集團、以不利於簽字國一方、則其他一方允不參加、因此種種、德蘇兩國互不侵犯條的、似亦不能更有所增益云、（廿二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　希特勒元首昨日在貝許德斯開登鎭接見駐土大使巴本、此事與德蘇締結不侵犯公的之消息同時公佈、於是一般咸懐疑德蘇談判、巴氏亦會參與其間、海通社頃自權威方面探悉、此種推測與事實不符、巴氏決不赴莫斯科、此决因母喪回國、其在薩爾資堡與元首暨外長舉行之談話、皆係關於土耳其事件、（二十三日海通電）</p>
<h3>法駐德使館　勸橋民撤退</h3>
<p>柏林　法國駐德大使館頃通吿法國僑民勸其返國、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>白鳥敏夫　謁義外長　與德蘇訂約有關</h3>
<p>羅馬　日本駐義大使白烏敏夫、昨日午後訪問齊亞諾外長、與之談論德蘇兩國商訂互不侵犯條的事、會云日本政府聞悉之餘、不以爲可、此間一般人頃評論此語、咸謂日本對於德義兩同盟國、至少已不能加以援助矣、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法決定中止　三國參謀談話　但不得視為已吿決裂</h3>
<p>巴黎　據「强毅報」載稱、巴黎及倫敦兩方面已決定完全一致行動、中止莫斯科參謀談話、但非決裂、（廿三日路透社電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　據今日此間消息、英法軍事代表團會舉行會議、蘇聯方面米出席參加、（廿三日路透社電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　今日此間消息靈通之蘇聯方面、表示德蘇互不侵犯條的不致與蘇英法三國所計　的防守同盟相抵觸之信念、此種言論在有資格之觀察家視之、認爲有極大意義、蓋以其表示蘇聯政府仍有繼續三國反侵略談話之意也、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　據「每日郵報」巴黎訪員電稱、英法政府昨晚訓令其駐蘇大使、通知蘇聯外長莫洛托夫、吿以波蘭今準備接受蘇聯援助、査莫斯科三國談判因以停滯者、即爲波蘭除接受蘇聯軍械接濟外、並須接受蘇聯軍隊援助一點、該訪電又稱英、法大使將請莫洛托夫儘速予以答復云、路透社莫斯科訪電稱、英大使西資與莫洛托夫咋晚晤談一小時、內容未詳、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　駐莫斯科英法大使、已請蘇聯外長莫洛托夫示以德蘇所擬不侵犯條的之大概內容、以便英法决定其對於參謀談話之意見（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>巴黎　據此間消息靈通人士宣稱、英法蘇三國代表在莫斯科舉行之軍事談話、仍將繼續舉行、據莫斯科方面申稱、德蘇締結互不侵犯公的之後、三國談話幷非即無繼續進行之可能、然而此項談話、昨日則已暫時中斷、此間相信倘能恢複舉行、則英法兩國代表對於軍事秘密、當不肯輕意洩漏矣、（二十三日海通社電）</p>
<h3>義國所行政策　信守原來方針　決定以「現實精神」　俾與新局勢相適應</h3>
<p>羅馬　德國與蘇聯商訂互不侵犯條的所造成之新局勢、義國已以「現實精神」、迅即相與適應、關於各軸心國政策之突然傾向蘇聯、此其原因何在、政府當局並未向民間作何解釋、各報越稱、義國政府所行政策、仍以選輯爲本、並信守原來方針」、外交部發言人則謂、「曩者倘有以軍事行動或十字軍式的戰爭加諸蘇聯、義國亦決不致出而參加」、凡此種種、外國人士聞悉之餘、莫不爲之驚異、各觀察家並謂、去歲慕尼黑會議時、蘇聯爲英法所漠視、今蘇茲聯所由決定與德國商訂互不侵犯條的、即所以雪前此之恥云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英造艦程序　達最高峯　兩日內三艦下水</h3>
<p>倫敦　英國造艦程序加速進行、兩日內有巡洋艦三艘、行下水禮、創立全世界新紀錄、三巡洋艦中「奈基利阿」號及「毛利喜阿斯」號爲八千噸級、裝有六吋口徑大砲多尊、「代多」號較前二艘稍輕、但亦裝有六吋口徑大砲、下數月內、將有裝有十叫口徑大砲之三萬五千噸主力艦二艘、及二萬三千噸航空母艦二艘下水、不久更有巡洋艦四艘、及驅逐艦多艘下水、英國造艦程序、已達最高峯、在數月內、實際上將有艦隊一大隊下水、在泰恩河上、有兵艦二十四艘在建築中、所有船塢、全力工作、造艦費用計値美金三萬五千萬元、（二十三日美聯電）</p>
<p>瑪爾太　瑪爾太海岸之鐵絲網防禦事現已接通電流、此爲當局所採軍事戒備計畫之一、所有駐防將士、一律準備應付任何事變、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>英糧食管理　缺點滋多</h3>
<p>倫敦　上次大戰時糧食部重要人員之一麥西爵士、在諾威克產業運輸協會演說、謂英國現在食糧供給情形、較上决大戰時、允爲惡劣、『政府「糧食保衛」委員會實際上無糧可供彼管理、若有糧食可供給、則根本無所謂「保衛」、此委員會之糧食統制分配工作、與上决大戰時無異』、麥西爵士繼又稱、「政府應從速購買加拿大所產之麥、今日英國人口已較前次大增、而商船則反少、農民人數亦已大减、增加本國糧食生產、實爲今日國防中最切要之事」、（二十三日美聯社電）</p>
<h3>港對日貿易　數量激增</h3>
<p>香港　據港出入口統計署報吿、香港出入商品共九六五零萬元、入口五零八零萬元、出口四五七零萬元、均較去年同期間增加、計入口增加百分五·九、出口增二四·五、日貨輸入爲三一一萬元、輸出二十六萬餘元、較前增加逾一倍有奇、（二十二日電）</p>

<h3>如何消滅食米恐慌</h3>
<p>長久未獲解決的上海食米問題，日來形勢愈趨惡劣：不僅食米的交易，已遠離工部局所規定的限價；甚至有錢無處購買，逐漸形成恐慌的現象，因此引起社會的極大不安。上海現在居留着四百萬以上的中外居民，若聽任這種不安狀態繼續蔓延，就會成爲一個狠嚴重的社會危機。</p>
<p>上海食米問題之不能獲得解決，主要的原因乃是所謂特殊環境的作弄；以致來源方面，失去正常的機能；銷售方面，遭受奸商的操縱，就來源言，上海食米往昔近則來自無錫常熟，遠則取之長江一帶；今則長江上下游，或則不能照常耕耘，或於產地被人收買，或於運輸途中被徵苛捐雜稅，或於運抵上海附近時，被人持强截奪，使其不易到達上海租界。就銷售言，自上海成爲特殊環境之後，中國政府已無法執行法令權力；於是一般奸狡商人，乃投機取巧、囤積居奇，故意抬高米價，以圖獲得厚利；雖有工部局的限價，和米業團體的自動制止，也不能發生實際的效力，日來且造成狠嚴重的米荒；難道眞的上海各堆棧中，無復存米，而街底垂罄嗎，這是不能不令人懷疑的！</p>
<p>要針對着上述原因而謀取得根本的解決辦法　除非中國政府，將來能夠打破這種特殊環境，而執法相繩：目前尙還無此可能。但爲保持上海社會安甯起見，我們却不能不切望租界當局和界內人民密切合作，以適當的方法，組止恐慌狀態的發展。日咋公共租界納稅華人會曾上書工部局，對解決食米恐慌問題，建議三項辦法：（一）積極疏通來源；（二）陸續購貯，實行平耀，所虧費用，暫行借墊，再圖彌補；（三）淸査所有各銀行錢荘倉庫中米業和個人的存米，令其限期照限價或半價出售。這第三項的辦法，實爲目前救急的唯一對策；第一二項辦法，則爲比較長期的穩定米價政策。但就租界常局能力而言，除第一項辦法，尙須與有關方面商洽外；其餘二項辦法，租界當局，都有立即實行的可能。以租界當局的地位；諒來必能領導上海財界領袖，共同籌募款項，爲平糶的費用，以施惠於界內的全體居民。前年「八一三」戰事發生後，租界當局對於食米的緊急處置辦法，那是非常値得稱頌的。現在正不妨再以同樣的方法，來應付目前的局勢。至於調査存米，强迫平糶，這更是輕而易舉的事。爲全體上海居民的安甯，而限制少數人的居奇壟斷，這是和禁止烟賭具有同樣的社會意義。况租界行政當局，本以維持界內治安爲最大任務，而食米問題，又與治安關係極爲密切；故租界當局對於解決食米問題，實負有重大的責任。並且要知道租界當局對於這一問題，倘不能表示力量，則將使租界方面遭受其他的困難。租界當局爲免除這種困難起見，對於有關治安的食米問題，自宜急速實施這些有效的解決辦法。</p>
<p>我們還要正告一般居奇的人們：此時此地，應該人人能以同情心代替中國政府的法令。目前的上海，正如大洋中的孤舟，大家應以同舟共濟的精神，彼此互助，於艱苦環境中等待最後勝利的到臨；切不可仿效海盜的行爲，乘此時機，專以刦掠他人爲事。須知人類的生存是集體的，整個社會的紊亂，決不許有個人安全的存在；現應立即覺悟，犧牲小我，放棄投機漁利的企圖，即使牟利，亦不應以米糧爲壟斷的目標。我們更希望上海米業及各界人士，能以集體的力量，詳細調査上海市塲上的食米投機情形，對於少數奸商，應即根據人道正義，而予以社會的制裁；利用租界的警力，平糶各倉庫中的囤米，以消滅目前的恐慌現象。此外如與米業有密切關係的銀錢業，一面檢舉同業中的敗類，不要坐視他們利用了大衆的存款，從事於喪天害理的囤積；要知道他們在社會是蟊賊，在銀錢業是害羣之馬，將使銀錢業全體受其不良影響的！同時並須鄭重放款，莫爲投機者所利用。不但如此，銀錢業並應以服務社會的精神，集合同業，邀的公團，與租界當局與界內居民相合作，對於食米的採辦與分配，儘所可能的大規模活動；以解決當前的糧食問題，亦即所以消弭社會的危機。至於居民：一，不宜逾量儲藏，以助長奸商的詭計，增進問題的嚴重；二，不宜輕舉妄動，以促成社會的紛擾；三，或以家庭爲單位，或組織消費合作，除食米問題先行設法個別解決之外。儘量改食各種雜糧。我們且以針對了食米問題的嚴重，每人皆負責任；食麵食麥，乃至於食山芋芋艿，數天一决亦好，天天如此更好；在富有之家，原來不愁米貴，但爲了大衆缺米而改食比米更貴的麵包餅干之類，亦是合情合理的辦法。</p>

<h3>羅斯福擬再度　世界和平呼籲　美政府商討中立問題　歐洲美僑作撤退準備</h3>
<p>華盛頓　歐洲時局突轉嚴重之後、羅斯福總統原在太平洋面遨遊、茲已遄返此間、將於二十五日到達、或將爲和平作最後努力、（二十　日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　據今日此間消息、羅斯福總統又將作　似去年九月間之挽救和平的呼籲、因羅斯福總統除訓令各主管機關對於歐局作詳細之報吿外、並將中止其休夏之時間、准於星期五日返華盛頓也、惟國務卿赫爾則已於今日返此、又代理海軍部長愛迪生·陸軍次長約翰生·參謀部長馬紹爾·空軍部長阿諾特·國務院副官倍利皆與國務副卿威爾斯會談、討論美國之中立問題、及如何保陣海外美僑之安全問題、又據波蘭駐美大使濮托基訪問威爾斯言、波蘭決爲保衛疆土而戰、（二十二日美聯電）</p>

<p>華盛頓　此間官塲初聞德蘇同意締結互不侵犯條約之消息爲之驚愕、今則驚愕已定、重新考慮、覺此事之爲禍、並不若初料之甚、國務院因尙未悉其內容、故對於此的不欲作何批評、惟消息靈通方面則縷述下列數點、視爲稍可使人寬慰者、（一）穌聯旣向英國案價甚昂、未必予德國以在東歐行事之自由手腕、而放棄其索取相當代價之權、（二）德國在東歐繼續侵略、豈爲蘇聯之利、蘇聯未嘗不知之、（三）希特勒削弱反共公的並使日本在遠東處於可受中蘇兩國更堅强的抵抗之危境、其所付之代價、誠屬不小、上述第三節常然使美國人士滿意、然有一憾事足以抵消之者、即遠東侵略雖受頓挫、然歐洲和平陣綫、允其是英國外交、已遭嚴重打擊是、美總統雜斯福對於英國外交、近數月來固屢欲加强之也、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　此間政府官員認爲假若蘇德不侵犯條的成立、則蘇聯有一躍而支配遠東局面之可能、同時蘇聯在遠東方面勢力之鼎盛、亦足以增加美國在東方之地位、再則、蘇聯擺脫歐洲方面之羈絆後、對於中國亦從此易於援助矣、惟爲自中國獲取報償計、大的將要求中國對於共產主義作繼續之讓步、總之、蘇聯此項行動、在避免在歐洲方面作主力戰、而願在遠柬方面作比較小規模的戰爭、殊爲顯然、（二十三日美聯電）</p>

<p>東京　外務省發言人今晨招待新聞記者時、吾認蘇日有簽訂互不侵犯條的之可能性、據稱、日本之政策爲反共以防衛日本帝國、此項政策乃不可更變者云、日本現正待柏林發出關於提議中德蘇互不侵犯條件的更詳盡之情報、故當新聞記者以此事相叩時、發言人以甚審愼之態度答稱、今不能正確解釋大局、惟我人希望德國不作與反共公的相矛盾之辦法、德蘇新條約是吾循新方針、抑係從前蘇德互不侵犯條的之復活、目前猶不明瞭云、或問反共公的苟非反對蘇聯、則反對誰乎、發言人作規避之答覆、僅謂反共公的「現仍爲活的工具」、惟發言人料德蘇談判、頗少決裂之可能性、（廿三日路透電）</p>
<h3>東報承認　遭遇難關</h3>

<h3>渝報觀察　於華有利</h3>
<p>重慶　今晨此間各報以特別顯著地位、刋載德蘇互不侵犯條的行將簽字之消息、並表示一致之意見、謂兩國重行接近、結果當有利於中國抗戰、中政府機關中央日報稱、英法對國際局勢之新轉變、或將震驚、惟可安全預料者、即蘇聯爲世界和平、將繼續施用壓力、且仍將擁護集體安全計劃是也、日本現已孤立無助將來應取何種對外政策、勢將茫然失措云、中國陸軍機關掃蕩報對蘇德重行接近之消息、表示樂觀、一如上海與其他各處中國人士然、該報極重視蘇聯在「滿」邊屯集軍隊之消息、新民報稱、蘇聯因期望和平、乃決計與德國締結互不侵犯條的、此的與英法蘇三國反侵略同盟、並無抵觸之處、故德蘇雖重行接近、而英法蘇仍可望於不遠將來締結協定云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>英國外交　重大失敗</h3>
<p>倫敦　此間各晚報評論德蘇互不侵犯條約、咸謂此决條的之效力、於德國侵犯第三國時、不能限制蘇聯之行動、此點爲各報所特別重視者、「標準報「謂該的勢將使歐洲局勢更形惡化、德國方面認爲條的業已成立、但蘇聯則認爲里賓特羅甫來莫斯科、僅爲談判之開始、蘇聯與德國成立是的、爲李維諾夫去職後蘇聯孤立政策登峯造極之作云、「新聞晚報」則評爲英國外交之重大失敗、但英法兩國對履行其義務之决心、並不因此而减弱云、又各報一致認爲此的予日本以重大之打擊、（二十二日電）</p>
<p>倫敦　「孟却斯德指導報」今日著論批評德蘇締結互不侵犯條約事、謂此項消息如歐洲聞之表示驚奇、則日本聞之必大爲惶駭、此項條的或屬無甚價値、如對德無利、朋對日亦無害、惟即使此種情形果確、日本政府對於德國未來之援助、亦將感覺難以信任、德國如以犧牲日本在遠東之利益於己有利、則德國顯然願意爲之、日本洞悉此情、定將一再思慮而不即担任支持德國在歐洲方面之野心。目前日本之視德國、定亦若英國之視蘇聯云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>德報評論　躊躇滿志</h3>
<p>柏林　關於德蘇兩國締結互不侵犯公的一事、昨晚此間各報始撰文、加以詳細評論、一般論調均謂、德蘇締結互不侵犯公的、乃表現德國現實主義之外交政策、亦即英國拒絕與德國成立諒解推行包圍政策之直接結果、各報機追述目十九世紀普魯士奧地利與沙皇一世合作對付拿破崙之史跡、以迄俾士麥對俄羅斯提供保障條的之一段德蘇友好關係、「漢堡地方日報」之言有謂、「英國之逡巡不決、終使進行已久之莫斯科談判陷於失敗、益顯德國善用時機、採取適當行動之能力、德國決不允其傳統權利聽人剝奪、德蘇締結互不侵犯公的、乃包圍政策之必然結果、蓋主張包圍政策之國家、始終認爲德蘇冰炭不相容、遲早難免發生衝突、殊未料及德蘇竟在目前、恢復俾士麥下台前之一段傳統友好關係、且該項關係、在世界大戰之後尙持續數年、「柏林夜報」評日、「德蘇兩國迄無領土爭端、從此民主國家當可承認歐洲命運繋於軸心國家之手中」、「德意志總彙報」評日、歐洲政治及世界局勢、今已爲之改覜、德國會一再昭告世人、德國決不容歐戰歷史重演於今日與未來、現已見諸事實、德國全國人民對此改造世界局勢之德蘇互不侵犯公的、咸表極度歡迎、」該報繼引英國勞合喬治之言日、和平陣綫若無蘇聯加入、則必成爲無政治與軍事價値之空洞組織、誠然、今英國已失此反對德國大陸政策之機會矣、（二十三日海通電）</p>
<h3>義報著文　極力揄揚</h3>
<p>羅馬　「義大利新聞報」主筆蓋達頃在該報發表一文、評論德蘇締結互不侵犯公的事、其文略調、「波蘭現已陷於孤立、倘英法兩國仍欲履行其對波蘭之保障義務、現已不能獲得蘇聯之協助、德蘇締結互不侵犯公的之消息突如其來、誠使人驚異不置、但義大利前會警吿波蘭、彼在地理位置上所處之危機、以及其境內數百萬烏克蘭人與白俄羅斯人乃爲腹心之息、今英法與蘇聯進行締結協定談判、四月於茲、一無成就、而德元首希特勒舉一棋、即定大局、世界局勢於頃刻問爲之改觀」、（二十三日海通電）</p>
<h3>法報對蘇　疑忌不安</h3>
<p>巴黎　本日法國報章之評論與昨日大致相似、時代報一向取親蘇之態度、但本日亦發表長篇之社評、認爲蘇聯與德國訂互不侵犯條的、猶如以七首刺擊友邦、令人不寒而慄、大多數法國報章認爲蘇聯採取新政策之背景爲何、殊難臆測、或者再有驚人之變動、亦未可知、（二十三日海通電）</p>
<p>巴黎　法國報紙現皆謂莫斯科舉棋不定、近且成立對德商的、故德蘇互不侵犯條的本屬意中事、此的未必產生德國所期望之結果云、「巴黎時報」指此爲歐洲史中政策與主義之極大轉變、謂德政府處於絕境中、不得不開闢新途經、對蘇之不侵犯條的雖與各事之本質相抵觸、然爲阻止英法蘇成立軍事聯盟之最穩妥辦法、此舉誠屬大胆、然其所希望之結果能吾獲得、則殊未必、此的顯然已使反共公的歸於消滅、而德國所擬伸其勢力於巴爾幹諸國或烏克蘭或黑海之任何計劃、亦將因以擱置、世人於此不禁抱有一種見解、以爲希特勒自覺陷於困難地位後、乃欲以迅雷不及掩耳之手段、解除其自己所造成之危機、而作策略上之撤退云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>蘇空軍在滿邊　轟炸益烈</h3>

<p>倫敦　最高法院法官凱塞爾斯今日對於代表天津四嫌疑犯聲請發給保護人身法令狀一案已予駁斥、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>倫敦　關於天津四嫌疑犯之人身保護法令狀傳達書一案、今晨又由最高法院推事凱塞爾斯開審、聲請律師爲蒙克頓爵士及平民二人、而沃康納則爲外相哈立法克斯之代表、沃氏今日繼續其辯論時、曾以得諸外部之冊籍一本呈交法官、凡與英國對華關係有關之各種條的均黨載共中、沃康納謂、英國在華、除根據各項條的者外、別無其他權利、擴展人身保護法及於非英帝國人民之計畫、前無所聞、其實此種權力、唯英王對其本國人民始有之、但對於非本國人民則不然云、聲請律師蒙克頓爵士、因沃康納氏曾提及援華運動委員會之地位、有所答辯、謂李斯托威爾勳爵個人、對於天津四據疑犯之安全、頗爲關切、並已獲得此四人之委託代爲聲請保護人身法令狀、渠已接天津美籟律師伊斯桑來電內稱、「四嫌疑犯已委君爲彼等之代表」云、（二十三日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　最高法院法官凱塞爾斯、今日處理保護人身法令狀之呈請時、外相哈立法克斯之代表沃康納氏堅稱、天津英租界羈禁四嫌疑犯事、乃依據一種條的而行、故此爲國家之行動、至於是吾依據條的、非法院所得研訉、外部在最近四十八小時內、已接到中國地方法院準備迎提犯人之通知、在法院對目前此案之呈請、不下判決時、無人願見犯人引渡云、此案定明日續審（二十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>歐洲兩週來　大事紀　十日至廿二日</h3>
<p>巴黎　德蘇兩國决定簽訂互不侵犯條的之後、德國軍隊有自本月廿四日午前起估據波蘭走廊之說、東歐局勢、因而愈益緊張、茲將八月十日起至二十二日止歐洲時事、補誌如次、以供參考、</p>
<p>八月十日　義外相齊亞諾前往德國薩爾資堡城、與德外長里賓特洛浦進行重要談話、但澤國社黨領袖孚斯德發表演說、再度聲明該市居民擁護希特勒元首之意、英外相哈里法克斯亦復再度聲明、對於波蘭國决定履行的束、</p>
<p>十一日　義國召集後備兵兩級入伍、英國空軍舉行演習、其規模之大、實爲歐戰結束以來所僅見、義國半官報紙發出表示、謂德國與波蘭開戰時、各民治國若果援助波蘭、則義國即當援助德國、</p>
<p>十二日　義德兩國外長前往貝許德斯伽登鎭晋謁希特勒元首、德國各報加緊反波蘭宜傳運動、並擴大要求範圍、欲收回波蘭走廊、但澤國社黨領袖孚斯德冉度發表演說、重申但澤市併入德國之决心、</p>
<p>十三日　德元首希特勒再度接見義外長齊亞諾後、齊亞諾即遄返羅馬、德國官方並聲明談話結果、足以證明兩國軸心國聯帶一致的關係、</p>
<p>十四日　國聯駐但澤高級委員白克哈特前往貝許德斯伽登鎭、會見德元首希特勒、</p>
<p>十五日　義國當局發出聲明、謂德義兩國外長談話、實乃各軸心國對於各民治國之最後警吿</p>
<p>十六日　德外長里賓特洛浦再度與匈牙利外長查基進行談話</p>
<p>十七日　德國定於本月廿七日爲丹倫堡勝利舉行紀念大會、各國咸皆企盼希特勒元首所當發表之演說、</p>
<p>十八日　匈外長査基與德元首希特勒進行談話之後、自德國轉往羅馬、會晤義外長齊亞諾、據傳德國已與斯洛伐克邦簽訂軍事協定、</p>

<h3>日本經濟恐慌徵象　金準備及原料儲積均見減少</h3>
<p>莫斯科　紅星報頃登載「日本經濟恐慌之微象」一文、其辭云、</p>
<p>「日本軍閥利用通貨澎漲及增加捐稅手段竭力榨取勞苦大衆、及積極在世界市塲推行傾銷政策之結果、已使其戰爭工業及各附屬部門極臻繁榮、然而因此其整個經濟發展乃顯呈異常偏枯之性質、一方面工業生產雖有增加、別方面農業則非常落後、而民衆之購買力亦更趨衰弱、同時、生產工具之生產雖亦有某種程度之進步、消費品之生產在戰時則降落此銳、就日方之統計數字觀之、一種經濟衰落在日本確已於一九三八年開始、而至同年末季、極衰落更影饗及於生產工具生產方面、</p>
<p>日本金準備及原料儲積之减少亦爲將來恐慌之重要微象之一、截至現在、日本幾已用去其金準備三分之二、所餘可用以償付外國之黃金僅敷今後一年之用、</p>
<p>日本戰費之激增已漸使其金融及經濟趨於枯竭、按照日本「東方經濟家」雜誌顯然過度誇張之估計、日本一九三九年度全部國民收入亦不過二百萬萬日圓、而本年度國家預算支出則達一百萬萬日圓之巨、其中直接戰費佔七十萬萬、本年度捐稅等項已增加百分之一百五十、而在本年預算內達廿五萬萬日圓、內國公債總額在數年前猶僅四十萬萬日圓、而本年則將超過全部國民收入總數、更至目前戰費總額已達一百二十萬萬日圓、而此後每月將截需五萬萬日圓、</p>
<p>農業恐慌之擴大在經濟形勢之一般嚴重化中、允居極端重要地位、目前達到應徵年齡之壯丁的百分之五十、業已被派往前錢、大批農民更離開農村而往軍火廠工作、全國馬匹三分之一已被微發充戰爭之用、農業生產業已銳落、因此工業恐慌之徴象乃與農業者相輔而行、</p>
<p>日本帝國主義者現方努力進一步實行全部國民經濟總動員、以應戰時需要、此舉或能使恐慌之爆發展緩、然待至日本經濟全被戰爭耗盡、恐慌不能不爆發時、其影響必更爲嚴重也、（二十二日莫斯科電）</p>

<h3>字林西報評論　德蘇互不侵犯協定　對於大局不應作黯淡觀感　但日本將全遭其與國所棄</h3>
<p>德蘇行將締結互不侵犯協定、昨日本報社評已論其影響矣、茲將日昨本埠字林西報對此問題之評論、迻譯如决、讀之可諗英人輿情之一斑、英人對於此事、頗形鎭靜、法人亦然、一若出於矯揉造作者然、然亦未可厚非、蓋意外之打擊、突如其來、難關當前、唯一正當途徑、厥爲一心一德、忍痛奮鬬、以求克服困難化險爲夷、若驚愕之餘、自起紛擾、或痛哭流涕、勸衆屈服、則徒渙散人心、示敵以弱、而於大局、毫無裨補、此沉毅果敢之民族所不願而亦不屑爲者也、——譯者</p>
<p>希特勒之獲蘇聯同意締結互不侵犯協定也、已博得顯著之外交勝利、此於目前歐洲大局或有深遠之影響、惟因此所表露之任何恐慌、與夫對所作較此項新發展宣布前更甚之黯淡觀點、予以接受、二者無一得其正焉、雙方因協定所獲之利益、殊爲顯明、此舉驟觀之、似爲掣英法兩國之肘、然其最後結果、決不致如最初感覺之有害於兩國、德國因有此協定、萬一歐戰果作、蘇聯不因德國在波羅的海諸國之活動而受威脅、則可保蘇聯之長守中立、此種中立、可使德國向中立國獲得糧食與原料之供給、且予德國以作持久戰之機會、就軍事觀點而論、德國已紓其束陣綫蘇聯出雄師以與周旋之憂、而能以全力對付西歐之民治國矣、就蘇聯觀點而論、所獲之利益、亦同樣重要、德國旣不復爲其西陲之患、今而後、對付日本所提出之遠東問題、可不必有所顧慮矣、此使日本加入羅馬柏林軍事同盟之觀念、失其效用、此使竭力拉攏日本加入同盟之義國、受一峻拒、此使反共公的之實力、减弱甚巨、反共公的最重要之一分子、旣與蘇聯釋嫌而訂互不侵犯協定、則餘二參加者之地位、顯然大趨荏弱、希特勒專心致志所造成之强國團體、旣供應其一己特殊需要、今或已於其中散播分裂種籽、亦意中事也、</p>
<p>曩者德國軍事主腦、嘗公然堅主與蘇聯締結同盟、經希特勒本人之反對、乃未成事實、希氏今旣與蘇聯訂此互不侵犯協定、則對於德國軍界、已稍作讓步矣、蓋兩國主義之融洽、雖不能言其有任何眞正機會、但半塊麵包之互不侵犯、固較全無麵包之軍事同盟爲佳也、至於此一顯著發展所將及於波蘭之影響、今尙未可確言、惟當知此種決定、使種種一切於英法蘇所議軍事盟的未簽定以前、常在可能之中、萬一因波蘭問題發生戰事、英法必將單獨以戰軸心國、此常爲可能之事、雖此互不侵犯協定確切消除蘇聯與英法締結軍事同盟之可能性、但並未造成所未豫先料及之軍事局勢、惟波蘭之決心拒絕德國要求、或有視前爲弱之可能、然亦未可遽必其然、因但澤之被併入德國版圖、與夫波蘭走廊之爲德國佔有、顯將使德國於經濟上制波蘭之死命、果爾、則波蘭將不復爲獨立之國矣、觀於波蘭人民目前之氣槪、或不願接受此種變局、如果予以接受、不啻全國自殺、故如在來日得悉波蘭抵抗之志願並未更變、亦屬無足深異之事、波蘭如決取此途徑、英法必出而援之、如共所的、雖在最初接觸中、德國所處之地位、似將視前爲佳、然戰局終必好轉、此則顯然無疑者也、德蘇協定之一般結果、如在目前使希特勒手腕轉强、則羅馬柏林東京軸心、必爲轉弱、而破壊日本加人德羲軍事同盟藉以收獲利益之任何機會、且使殷切成此團結之義國受一峻拒、假使日本於蘇日發生戰爭之際、難望獲得受互不侵犯協定的束的德國之援助、則日本絕不致加入此種同盟、故締結反共公的之三國、今日彼此之關係、可綜述如下、德國在與義國之軍事同盟中曾簽定一的、明白表示如蘇義發生爭端、義國不能盼望德義軍事同盟中之主要分子之軍事援助、義國初欲日本加入軍事同盟、今將見德國無意招致日本加入此盟、以爲其侵略之助、日本或已恍悟德蘇互不侵犯協定造成之局勢、已使共處於確切不利之地位、並承認羅馬柏林柬京軸心已無使其加入德義軍事同盟之價値、故今日之一般局勢、已使羅馬柏林東京軸心之小分子經一惶惑之變遷、德國如確在運用其權謀、不顧其與國、共至不顧此項發展或將及於彼等之影響、則就最近所發生之種種事變觀之、上述一切、似極正確也、德國或將轉勸義國亦與蘇聯締結互不侵犯協定、此說驟聞之、似屬奇突、然在已往數年中義國追隨德國、亦步亦趨、義國效德所爲、固意中事也、果爾、則日本將何爲乎、彼將全遭其今日之與國所棄、如民治國之棄之然、彼甚有陷於孤立之危險、故在此種情勢中、對於大局、不應作黯淡之觀感、蓋今並未創成新地位、蓋此非隨時所可能者也、假使德國果如所云、賈其二與國、則共最後結果、或將證明轉足增厚民治國之實力耳、</p>

<h3>紗花多頭大量出籠　雙馬紗慘跌七十元　其他亦跌四五十元</h3>
<p>紗市開盤尚平、略見軟弱、旋以蘇德訂互不侵犯條的正式宣佈、市上議論紛紜、莫衷一是、謂利於我國、於是市塲震盪、人心樂觀、多頭鑒於國際形勢轉變、對於商品一律看小、因之羣爭巨量出籠、一時籌碼充濫、買者視來勢洶湧、雖有維持支撐之意、然環境如斯、亦無勇氣矣、實則連朝拉提過高、至於港帮需要雖不斷、據市塲言、廣帮客商自己含輸贏之交易、亦占百分之五十以上、故一旦反映驟現、乃有不可牧拾之象、猶如堤決崩潰、二十支雙馬棧單跌風最慘、較上日價在落七十元、現貨亦跌、開盤價尙做七百五十元、後受惡劣消息支配、跌至收盤價爲七百元、比上日價猛跌六十四元、其他紗亦降四五十元之譜、此種情形、使人莫不談虎色變、半日成交統計八百五十五包、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如左、</p>

<h3>紗價慘落　棉花廠佃轉靜　惟原棉爲戰時必需品　各方深信將有漲無跌</h3>
<p>現棉交易、寥若晨星、華棉完全陷入停頓之途、惟印棉稍有成交、然額量微渺之至、且均在上午談妥之交易、旋以國際局勢改觀、紗價慘落六七十元之巨、致唇齒相依之原棉、當然牽入漩渦之中、據市塲言、各棉價每担較上日驟漲十元以外、廠方鑒於情形嚴重，無意採辦、蘇北來源隻包未到、茲將售盤情形錄左、</p>
<p>另訉滬埠外棉交易、因蘇德互締不侵犯條的、殊與我國抗戰大有裨益、因之人心異常興奮、惟投機者以今後歐局勢將不寗英國純金報跌、故市上投機者紛紛獲利了結、匯兌因而放長、美匯一度曾到七元二五、衆信此乃一時人心浮蕩所致、折合原棉價格、每担可廉四五元、同業間均深信匯兌之放長、乃臨時浮多了結所致、將來一旦如歐洲戰局正成展開、則中國之海外交通、各國無暇兼顧、則中外交通恐將中斷、况且原棉乃戰時之必需品、故各方深信棉價之將有漲無跌也、市上前所盛傳之關金折合率之將改、均有利於棉價上騰之消息也、</p>
<p>外棉市價、靜寂已有多日之紐約棉市、昨日竟因歐局紧張消息之傳來、棉市殊形活躍、同業間均猛烈在市購買、原棉乃爲軍需原料、因德蘇之互訂不侵犯條的、歐洲政局之急轉直下、各國均極力作非常之準備、故海外棉商對美棉之採購、殊爲熱烈、因之收盤時價格較之上日漲十餘磅音、印度因處境稍異、連同預測尙漲二羅比半、埃及漲十餘磅音、</p>
<h3>糧食　米無變化　店方暢辦午後回好　新秈又到二千餘包</h3>
<p>杜粳　車輪包子到二千餘包、大局市面自隔昨一度回平後、昨則開手形勢更弱、行情下降、惟迄午以到貨寥落、本街店胃頓又活動、一霎間市面回升、結果形成定局、計開高錫粳三十九元、鮮常州粳三十九元、崑山蘇同帮各粳三十八元至三十七元六角、河下早晚稻三十五元至三十四元、原包子三十七元至三十八元、高陳尖三十六元至三十五元、新尖三十四元至十三三元、變元三十一元至三十元、統計成交不過七千餘包、</p>

<h3>粉銷日廣　麥價鬆動</h3>
<p>麵粉　査現粉走銷、自米價暴漲以來、需要日增、昨各米號之附帶零售麵粉者、紛紛要求廠方儘量供給、各廠爲維持民食起見、亦不予限制、惟須直接車送、以防囤戶中間牟利也、統市成交激增至四萬餘包、二號粉廠盤六元四角現鈔、回籠貨日趨混亂、售價竟抬至六元六七角云、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日麥市已稍回平、蓋因金融突然劇變、一般囤戶心思轉呆、市面頓受减色、價乃漸呈鬆懈、統市計由福阜兩廠辦去一萬餘包、價乏變動、囤戶僅進太倉麥一車、價爲九元九角半、</p>
<h3>油市金價下跌　豆油猛落　比最高小五六元</h3>
<p>昨日油市在國際形勢上有利法幣價値、加之歐洲風雲緊張、余價下瀉、人心站定、投機家頓受打擊、囤戶紛紛謀出籠、致午後挫跌亦猛烈、結果比上日最高價暴跌五六元、計共成交大連桶油一百桶、價自五十八元開盤、後頻削至五十四元、又神戶來連油三百桶、價自五十九元、直瀉至五十五元、夾青島桶油五十桶、價爲五十六元五角至五十四元云、</p>

<h3>絲茶　滬絲銳跌</h3>
<p>昨日絲市、因匯市放長、下跌甚劇、白廠七八分售價三九二五元、下跌八十元許、而洋行吃價已跌至三千八百元關內、故近數日之絲市、或將遭遇逆勞、</p>
<p>昨國外絲市略見回升、紐的現貨漲二分半、遠期漲二分半、橫濱現貨漲五元、遠期漲八元、但對於上海絲市，則因外匯變動之故、並未有若何扶助云、</p>

<h3>國際形勢改觀後　中國金融益有利　日方金融蒙受相當影響　歐亞商業前途將有變遷</h3>
<p>自外電紛傳蘇德訂立商務信用協定、繼以德外長即飛蘇磋商締結蘇德不侵犯條約之訉後、國際形勢、頓然改觀、國內外金融經濟市塲、受此項消息之刺激、人心頗受震動、中國方面金融界人士、一般預測蘇聯今後對遠東政策、勢將更趨積極、故法幣基礎、必將愈固、外匯益見穩定、而日本貨幣因其國內對反共協定遭受影響至何種程度、咸懐疑慮、勞將益爲軟弱、其于遠東方面商業金融之前途影響、頗足重視、茲誌群情如下、</p>
<p>有利中國　已見端倪</p>
<p>據金融界熟悉國際情勢者之觀察、認爲英法于歐洲局勢之現狀下、對但澤問題、旣深切關心、卒以牽制孔多、徘徊瞻顧、而突于此時蘇德關係忽有更張、然英法除靜觀其發展外、因對蘇關係、仍較良好、故雖遭意外頓挫、于英法地位與國勢、殆無所削弱、惟上海市塲一般以爲德國于締的後、今後將實行問鼎但澤、歐洲前途、未可逆料、故對德貨認爲今後來源或不如以前之暢捷、咸抱有沉機觀變、以期善價而沽之心、然此種觀察、未爲有識者所同情、蓋觀察家認爲德國或仍將以締的之聲勢、而爲希冀巧取但澤之一種方法、至于蘇聯方面、至少可得自由應付遠東之機緣、故以其認爲歐洲之影響、猶不如影響遠東之近且切也、一般情形、此訊之于中國經濟金融有利、可謂已　直接之良果、</p>
<p>日方金融　相當影響</p>
<p>日本方面、對蘇德關係、新近形勢、外示鎭靜、而市塲人心、則趨煩悶、昨日金融界人士、已獲日本各種股票價格趨軟之訊、日元在華與法幣之兌換率、昨續有降低（爲一元一角八分、）日本對蘇商業、本已微渺、經此蘇德商的之商訂、自更影響、至日本對德商業、因此亦受蘇貨輸德之影響、加以美日商的、美方宣佈廢止日期、日本商業上·經濟上、自更入于艱境、一般預料于日本之金融、殊受有相常之影　、</p>
<p>上海金融　一致好轉</p>
<p>上海金融市塲、因德蘇締訂蘇德不侵犯條的、因此一致好轉、以致造成黑市外匯繼續轉鬆、黃金暗市猛跌、證券暗市、統一各債飛漲、惟中國之法幣、此後已益趨華固、而法幣發行數量、雖較戰前增加、但現金準備、在百分之四十叫以上、且爲歐美各國現金準備之冠、並於外匯經平準外匯基金管理委員會竭力維持後、中央銀行之法定匯價、始終穩定、對各業之正當需要、仍予盡量供給、</p>
<p>黃金猛跌　公債飛漲</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向金融市塲探悉、（一）黑市外匯、英商匯豐銀行掛牌、依然不動、惟實際行市轉鬆英匯三辦士士六五、美匯七元、（二）黃金暗市、昨晨起猛跌、上午牧盤爲四千一百五十元、下午收盤三千九百六十五元、（三）證券暗市、昨晨飛漲、統一甲種收盤五十元零三角、漲一元五角、乙種收盤四十四元二角、漲一元零五分、丙種收盤四十一元九角、漲一元三角五分、丁種收盤四十元零八角、漲一元三角、戊種收盤四十一元四角五分、漲一元四角、（四）匯劃貼水、昨晨爲一百八十五元、較前日跌十元、</p>
<h3>偽「巿府」圖接收法院　工部局已拒絕　法院係由各國簽訂協定　任何問題應向各國接洽</h3>
<p>「上海市長」傳筱庵、對於租界第一第二兩法院、久思染指、迭决向公共租界當局及法國駐滬總領事要求「接收、」現悉公共租界工部局總辦費力浦已根據第一特區法院協定之規定、予以答復、認爲凡有關於第一特區法院之任何問題、應向各簽的國接洽、工部局之復文、大意略爲貴市政府於一九三九年八月十二日之公函、本局業已收到、查第一特區地方法院、係由協定所規定、該項協定、爲中國政府與巴西·美·英·挪威·荷蘭·及法國等各國政府之代表所簽訂、本局並非爲該協定簽訂之一員、故凡有關於第一特區法院之任何問題、應請向各該簽的國接治云云、</p>
<h3>滬郊游擊隊　日方稱有五千　常州事件日兵車一列出軌　金山衛灣門曾經一度克復</h3>
<p>二十三日法文上海日報載、在前星期時、有一遊行者、在虹橋區內、會見有五十餘名之游擊隊、在前星期日、日本駐滬防軍、曾派有一打以上之唐克車、開赴青浦方面、昨據日當局宣言、現在上海附近一帶之游擊隊、計有</p>

<p>虞氏建議　訂購洋米</p>
<p>虞氏向各重要團體建議文云、近日米價之騰貴　爲有史以來所創見、市人奔走警吿、米價巳四十元矣、人心惶惶、不可終日、其因年歉失收歟、曰非也、其有人囤積居奇歟、似是而實亦非也、則其故安在哉、無他、靑黃不接、存底不充、交通阻滯、來源稀少故耳、揆之現狀、默揣將來、米價五六十元、亦意中事、我人若不速籌善策、則後果不堪設想、弱者流爲餓莩、强者鋋而走險、盜賊蠭起、雈苻遍地則富有豈能獨保耶、其策維何、暫行訂購洋米、原價出耀、以資救濟、捨此何尙、夫際此外匯暴縮之秋、而云訂購洋米、何異飮酖止渴、無乃不智、其然歟、不知此决米價之暴漲、完全因來源阻塞、供不應求所致耳、近日報載搶米風潮已露朕兆、倘再不速籌辦法、則本市治安、豈堪設想、我以事關民食、刻不容綏、似不宜再在此小節上作打算矣、或曰、一旦洋米湧到、內地存米亦復源源而來、則我定米虧蝕何所取償、此節雖有可慮、然來源湧到、米價勢必低落、則民食無憂、馨禱不遑、何言取償、况尙有一救人救已之良策、惟須籲請各界統力合作耳、犧牲小我、保全大我、熱心各界、當予樂助也、其策如何、擬請各界（以一家一居爲單位）在最短期內、儘量向本組織委託訂購洋米若干包、先付定洋每包若干、集有成數、發電代定（價格照市）擬先由各同業公會入手、每一廠或一店、儘速訂購幾個月之食米、（其辦法可先向各該同業公會登記、然後將總數　報本組織訂購、）則自身給養、暫吿無憂、而存底充足、無求於人、則雖有來米而問津者少、揆以經濟原理、供過於求、市價低落、勢所必然、以此低價來米、留爲貧苦者糶食、則雖無救濟之名、而有救濟之實、在各廠店固無所損失也、然於平民則受惠匪淺矣、茲訂草章數則、藉供參考</p>
<p>籌組織民　食維持會</p>
<p>上海民食維持會章程革案如下、一、本會專以維持滬市民食爲宗旨、不以營利爲目的、因定名日上海民食維持會、二、本會由上海市商會·銀錢業·米業各公會發起、召集各團體各業公會，及地方士紳組織之、推定委員若干人、負責主持會務、三、本會先行籌集基金、以備貼補購米之一切損失、並向銀錢業接洽、商借購米之墊款、以資從速訂購、四、本會向外洋訂購洋米、悉取公開辦法、以示大公、而昭信實、五、本會隨時察酌滬市食米供求狀况及需要之數向洋行或產地訂購之、六、關於洋米之運輸、商請外國商輪公司、予以優惠之待遇、七、本會所購洋米、其米款暫由銀錢兩業填付、貨到歸銀錢業指定之倉庫存貯、以作保證、墊款之利息商請從輕、八、米業託本會代購者、酌收救濟費每包若干、以捕救濟費用之不足、非米業不收費用、其直接自行向洋行訂購者聽便、九、各業各帮各工廠等得委託本會代訂食米、數量不論多寡、本會一律接受，每包先收定銀若干元、概不計息、貨到出淸、不得拖延、十、凡委託本會代購之米、如因市價低落、延不出貨者、除將定銀充公外、如有不足、應行補償、並由保證人負連帶淸償之責、十一、各業應需食米、得由同業公會代向本會委託代購、由公會負責、不屬於公會者、應自行覓具妥保、十二、本會代購之米、須視委託之數量整批定購、貨到時通知委託人繳款出貨、十三、本會關於各項辦事之細則另定之、十四、本章程經各團體通過施行、</p>
<p>巿塲漲風　昨已稍戢</p>
<p>上海豆米市塲昨晨開市後、因各團體已籌款　續訂購洋米、工部局對自由運米到滬案、已向日當局交涉、同時各地存底運滬並未完全斷絕、於是市塲漲風稍戢、並聞米業團體已飭市塲管理委員會　制止食米之飛漲、以免影響平民生計、並勸吿販商設法將產地之米運滬出售、以維上海之民食、昨日米價實際行情、高粳每石三十六七元不等、</p>
<p>鋌而走險　治安可慮</p>
<p>昨午一時許、甘世東路路東米號內、突來六七人、衣衫襤褸、形似黃包車夫、向米箱內搶取食米、幸經附近崗捕聞警趕到、加以逮捕、遂各奔散、捕房立即加派崗捕駐守、沿路各米店均緊閉鐵門、惟門市照常、各米店門市存米、本不甚多、惟兩租界米號存米、現均堆私人住屋或隱僻地點、爲數若干未能詳査、前晚米店送米、亦有沿路被刦去者、</p>
<p>外報載稱　日方收購</p>
<p>大陸報去、邇來一般人具有印象、即上海現遇米荒、乃因日本缺米所致、此種印象昨日（二十　日）已得佐證、蓋悉中國境內之日方代辦人、刻正採購可以獲得之一切米糧、且至少已託西貢之上海某航運公司訂米七千噸、立即交貨也、昨聞在上海近郊可得各種米糧三十萬包、僅在上海　十哩外之農民、現以二十元售米一担、聞諸最負責方面、週杪前已有人在滬郊大舉採購但至星期一日爲止、到滬者僅一萬一千包、聞昨日另有一萬包到滬、惟據米商言、此數中僅小部份在本埠市塲出售、又聞應運入公共與法租界之米糧、現轉存於虹口棧房中、該處日商囤米已非一日、擬在最近將來向無援助的公共租界大獲投機漁利、而公共租界中商人亦隨之囤積、致已往數日中米糧雖大批運到、價格則繼續高漲、附近產米區每担仍售十五元、但被日商迅速購　、甚至售予滬商者、於將遝抵目的地時、大見减少、大的已被沒收故</p>
<p>自由運滬　交涉順利</p>
<p>日本本年有米糧短缺之可能、因大批米糧必須運給華北日軍、果爾、則虹口之存米或將運若干往日本、工部局昨日承認米糧局勢並無變動、局方向日當局交涉撤銷蕪湖之禁運、尙未得答覆、又英文大美晚報云、據工部局某員聲稱、工部局與日當局磋商准米更自由的運入上海事、進行順利、此項問題、不久可望獲得結果云、</p>
<p>松江白米　大批來滬</p>
<p>據航業界消息、松江白米、源源運滬、昨日有民利公司拖輪拖出米船十二艘、每艘的載一百十五担至二百担、共計二千餘担、今日（二十四）叉有合利航運公司拖帶三十餘船到滬、如因潮水關係、要遲明晨可到、該第二批食米、共計五千餘担、並悉松江郊外游擊區內縣政府照常辦公、定今日（二十四）起、嚴飭各米行以每担十八元代價舉行平糶、逾限食米充公、故鄕聞民食問題嚴重性完全消除、按松江日軍、僅守一城垣、城外四郊、盡在游擊隊控制中、故管理民食之權、仍操諸華軍之手、又據航業界消息、松江以上之五庫鎭、因米價漲至每担二十元以上、激動衆怒、將該鎭各米行之食米、全部搬出、挨戶分派一空</p>

<p>捕房偵查</p>
<p>經華探長蔣上佩·探員朱萬鈞·西探長戤士李·詳細偵査、發覺翁之所述、顯有疑點、因翁身戴之金戒一只、未遭刦去値此金價高昂之際、盜匪豈有不將此區區之金戒一併刦去、即根據翁所述經過之路綫、英法兩租界捕房所派搜査汽車之探捕甚多、豈有竟未遭　處之檢査之理、是以詳加詰問、經過十二小時之調査與盤詰、始</p>
<p>盡得眞相</p>
<p>緣翁近日迷於賭、日至好萊塢榮生等賭窟、以致負去巨款、無法彌補、乃出此謊報之計、在收得　千八百允賭款之後、即至中華書局購得小皮箱一只、將款儲入、寄存於泗涇路二十二號三樓其堂兄翁阿海處、遂後再購白巾一條、即雇車至捕房報告、探等嗣在泗涇路二十二號將原贓二千八百元吊出、同時並抄獲永安公司存摺一扣、尙存款一百數十元、而通孚公司在最近會被竊價値五百元</p>
<p>綢九十疋</p>
<p>是否亦係翁所爲、則尙須調查、昨晨解送特一法院刑一庭、捕房律師蔣保廉依刑法三三六條侵占罪起訴、以尙有偵査之必要、故請求改期再訊、經錢鴻業庭長質訊之下、諭令押候改期訊理、</p>

<p>衛生展覽大會特刋</p>
<p>— 虞洽卿題</p>
<h3>夏令衛生展覽大會宣言</h3>
<p>時屆夏令，　　困人，我人身處喧　都市中，　　　　，　所　　仄，空氣污濁，食物不潔，而病魔疫癘，輒在此夏令之際，交相活躍，　麼滋擾，如傷寒，霍亂，痢疾等，每年更殺人如麻，貽害社會，偶一不慎，傳染所及，危害生命，思之誠不寒而慄。</p>
<p>上海自淪爲孤鳥以後，更遺有數萬難胞，時至今日，尚呻吟滬濱，顛沛流離，值此夏令，彼輩伏處各收容所中，因住址狹陋，熱悶難當，痛苦自更甚一層，而尤以疾病疫高，如經傳染，即不僅一人或數人之生命懸於頃刻，即全體難胞，亦均不堪設想，故此次上海難民救濟協會負責諸公，暨社會各界領袖，發起勸募難民衛生經費運動，爲難民請命，其以可佩，其行可欽。</p>
<p>同人等，因亦深感此種　任之重大，一救濟難胞，消滅皮厲一實爲吾人目前迫切之任務，雖自覺力量薄弱，但亦敢不勉盡吾心，爰定於八月　四日至廿六日，假寧波同鄉會舉行夏令衛生展覽大會三天，列舉各種有關夏令之衛生模型圖表，廣爲宣揚，此外並舉行防疫注射及藥呂義賣，以及推銷樂善章等，一以呼起市民對夏令衛生之注意，一以　請社會各界對於勸募難民經費之同情與援助，　場其意義，探願全體市民，社會人士，加以積極之援助，務使集得資款，掃數供給難民經費，聊盡吾人天責，並擴大影響，推進整個夏令衛生運動之成功，減少疫癘，保持公眾健康，則同人幸甚，難胞幸甚，社會幸甚！</p>
<h3>本會爲延期舉行敬告各界</h3>
<p>初早籌備就緒祇以租界戒備矚令展緩舉行</p>
<p>時屆夏末秋初提介衛生運動實屬更見迫亟</p>
<p>我人因鑒於上海人口叢集，病患堪慮，而尤值夏伙之際疫癘橫生，傳染猖獗，且又見孤烏上尚有數罵難胞，偽處斗空，爲酷署所侵，缺乏衛生經費，需款殷切，以故發起夏令衛生展覽大會，一以唏起市民注意衛生，滅除病息，二以提成捐賣藥品，冀能救濟難胞，聊盡天實。</p>
<p>自此舉發起以來，我人即首得上海難民救濟協會諸公之同意與贊助並熱承社會各界廠商，藥房，機關及個人之愛獲與支持，或惠賜鴻文，或捐助藥品，或推銷券資，精神物資，交相援助，使我人更覺得道多助，於感激之餘，益增奮發努力之必！</p>
<p>惟是在舉行日期方面，大會本定於八月七日至九日假座　彼同鄉會開幕，一切均已籌備就緒，乃事出意外，適因以滬戰兩周年關係，租界當局爲顧全市民安全，實施戒備，自八月七日至十五日止，停止一切集會，並囑令展期，我人乃祇得遵諭改至今日（廿四）舉行，此中遷延時日，雖非同人之責，但於事前不能早爲預料及措，總覺抱有無限之歉意。</p>
<p>雖然，目下正值夏盡秋初之際，根據過去經驗，各種疫　傳染症等，輒在此時（初秋）爲最活躍猖狂，而人口死亡率亦以此時爆出高，蓋夏盡秋初，氣候之本質已變，而人類每不往意及此，偶一不慎，疾病隨之，故我人雖展緩至今，但提偽衛生之舉，實益覺其意義之重大，使命之迫切，同人等敢不自勉勉人，並希</p>
<p>各界人士加以諒宥！加以援助！加以匡正！</p>

<h3>益友社舉辦夏令衛生展覽會之意義</h3>
<p>— 奚玉書</p>
<p>益友社爲上海各商店店員所組成，爲職業青年增益身心之純粹機構，平時對於公益事業，莫不踴躍佔先，故益友社在上海社會中已着有聲譽矣。此次藥業醫師等十團體所組織之「上海難民救濟協會勸募衛生經費委負會」，益友社頗以未能事先參加爲憾，然其見義勇爲之精神無時或已，茲舉辦「夏令衛生展覽會」，事前曾得勸募衛生經費委負會之通過與贊助，該項展覽會之慮義，至爲深長，益友社舉辦衛生展覽會，掮負宣傳之責，補勸募委員會之不足，將來廣收善果，展覽宣傳賢爲重要因素之一，此次展覽可謂適當其會。「衛生」二字巳爲今日街頭最熱之名詞，但真能明瞭衛生之意義與其重要性者，恣尚未深入普遍，益友社能假此令節，　集衛生資料，舉辦展覽大會，啟發市民衛生智識，指引預防疫病之策，是實適當其時，故益友社舉辦之夏令衛主展覽會，時會相宜，誠一舉兩得之要務也。</p>
<h3>爲什麽要舉行夏令衛生展覽會？</h3>
<p>— 蔣君毅</p>
<p>益友社定於八月廿四日至廿六斤假　波同鄉會舉行夏令衛生展覽會。它的動機不僅在喊起上海市民對於夏令衛生的注意；而且也爲着社會的公益；這在益友社一貫爲社會服務的精神上，當是一個非常值得讚揚的義舉。</p>
<p>雖然一兩年來的夏令，上海租界當局對夏令衛生盡了很大的努力，普遍地施打防疫資，並做着種種衛生宣傳，以功防患於未然，收到了很大的傳效，但是這咱夏令衛生的宣面與推動，原不是一時期一方針的事，它必須要社會各團體機關興同來幫同努力，然後才能得到更大的功效，所以益友社這次舉行夏令衛生展覽會，也可說是對租界當局促進市民們注意夏令衛生的一咱幫助。</p>
<p>最近本市難民救濟協會曾這確是當前迫切需要的公益義舉，在整個上海市民安全方面而言，也確是有着莫大的關係，益友社這次舉行這個展覽會，也可以說是響應難民救濟協會爲難民謀福利的義舉，共同盡服務社會應盡的一份責任。我祝頌益友社舉行這次夏令衛生展覽會必能得到廣大的成功！</p>
<h3>爲着什麽？</h3>
<p>— 趙樸初</p>
<p>這幾天，夏令衛生展覽又緊張着益友社裏的空氣。有人說：「爲着什麼？他們老是這樣不怕忙，也不怕熱和熱，並且着實地非常歡喜牠們了。忙得流汗，便是我們自已的夏令衛生運動。</p>
<p>可是，真的爲着什麼呢？</p>
<p>我們曾經一再地聲述過：益友社的產生，是由於社會的需要。具體的說，現實社會裏存在着許許多多需要幫助的人：在經濟上，在智識上，在道德上，在健康上，在生活的一切方面，他們都需要着幫助。然而。他們所能得到的，又是多磨渺小得可憐的啊！因此，在這種的需要下，產生了益友社，而益友社也就在這種「幫助」的工作中成長起來。</p>
<p>說到道次夏令衛生展覽，固然，算不上一件十分了不起的事。在我們，不過是希望追隨上海各界先進的服務精神所結合的難民救濟協會之後，在勸募難胞夏令衛生經費運動中竭盡一些微薄的心力。可是我們這次所得到各界先進的鼓勵和扶導，是超過了我們所應當得到的——特別的多而又特別的熱烈。這不但使我們對於這次的工作格外的忙得起勁，雖滿身是汗而不辭，而且使我們對於過去所做的工作，也有了更明確的自信。</p>
<p>我們將要以這次衛生展覽作爲我們向社會作更大的貢獻的起點，繼續地竭盡我們的精力，從事於福利人　的事羹，使得幫助的人更多起來。假使，能夠有干萬分之一的成就的話，區區的［忙」和「熱」，又何足道哉？</p>
<p>記得釋迦牟尼佛曾說過這句話：「我負着血和肉的身體，爲着世界的利益。」這應該可以作爲回答「爲着什麼？」的問題了吧！</p>
<h3>「我」和「黃金」之外</h3>
<p>— 帆</p>
<p>也許是因爲「上海遍地都是黃金」的綠故吧？人們對於一切問題的考慮，除了把「我」和「黃金」如何連結在一起之外，似乎再也想不到其他的事情，甚至覺得世界上根本就沒有其他的問題存在！</p>
<p>我們曾經一再的申述過：益友社的產生，是由於社會的需要；具體的說：就是因爲世界上除了「我」和「黃金」如何連結之外，實際上還有許多重要的問題存在着，而有待解決；而問題的重心，則是在如何把「我」的范　擴大，使人們在「小我」之外，也做一些「大我」的事。益友社在這咱需要下產生，也就在這種工作中成長起來；自然，今後還應該繼續而且擴大的這樣的做去。</p>
<p>上海自成了孤島之後，居住的區城是縮小了，而人口反而大增，這自然有許多原因，這里不必研究，但人口增加的結果，使本來就頗爲嚴重的居住問題，更爲嚴重起來，一幛房子信上十來家，從前可以成爲漫畫家題材的，現在則早已喪失了它的資路，一間亭子開住上三家人，已是稀鬆平常的事，我們試想：當住這房子的主人公們，在通常十二三小時的工作之餘，拖着疲乏的身體回到這個「家」裏休息的時候，疾病死亡的機會之多，是不難想像的。但，暈總還算是住着房子，至於在砲火下徼倖逃命的難胞，和同難胞一樣的住在蘆棚里的那些最窮苦的人們，自然更不必說了。</p>
<p>上面說過：益友社是在「爲大我服務」的工作中成長起來的，這就是說：我們過去已經有過很多的服務，但我們並不滿足，而且我們將來永遠不會滿足，這次的夏令衛生展覽會，是爲響應上海各界領袖的「大我」精神所結合的難民救濟協會的號召，我們希冀在勸募難胞夏令衛生經費這一偉大工作中，竭盡我們一些微薄的心力；同時，我們想把遺一展覽會作爲我們對於社會作更大貢獻的起點，我們將繼這一展覽會的精神而發揚光大起來。</p>
<h3>談談夏令衛生運動</h3>
<p>— 言凡</p>
<p>夏來了，這個可怕的季節炙熱的驕陽，逼人的署氣，疫　的侵襲，熱浪的難常！，的確，夏對於人們——是一個嚴重的威脅，一個恐怖的暗影！</p>
<p>根據去年工部局年報所載，一九三八年單是公共租界人數的死亡率是五萬五千六百〇九人，這個驚人的數字，我們可以預測必定在夏季佔最大多數，而病症中的時疫，傷寒。腸胃病等却又都是在夏末秋初最易發生，而罹疾者更大多是我們職業界人士與勞苦同胞，這可以在每個黌院，藥房中去證明，因爲我們是社會中生活最低劣的一　，住所狹仄，飲食不潔，加以自天整日的工作，這對於身體的保持健康方面，當然有着莫大的關係！</p>
<p>因此，「益友社」對於我們廣大社友們的夏令衛生問題，是，早就覺得他的璽要與迫切性很努力地積極地企圖爲解除這個問題的痛苦與國難而奮鬥，住這半個月來，就發起籌備「夏令衛生防疫運動「，並自六月　七日至七月十五日在社中實施免費注射防疫，在今天，社更爲了響應上海難民歡濟會的徵募難民衛生經費，而舉行夏令衛生展覽大會，我們更希望全體社友格外注意，這是我們切向有利害的關係，切莫這個機會，同時，更必需大家來參加與完成這個運動，使我們能夠更文學更普遍使得由全體社友更擴大到全體難胞，全體市民都能得到這種福利。</p>
<p>病魔就是強盜，疫癘更是與侵略者同樣窮兇極惡的東西，我們希望大家務必以最大的熱忱，與防侵略，防災害同樣的精神，來努力開展與完成這個夏令衛生運動！</p>
<h3>夏令的衛生和健康</h3>
<p>— 史致富</p>
<p>氣候溫度的高低，對於人類的身體，有着很大的影響，好像華氏所說：靜處於熱的環境裹，正和在冷天用力一樣，所以身體在署天最易消耗，疲乏，甚至抵抗力減弱。再如極易傳染的霍亂傷寒等病菌，都是最適宜於烈的環境，因之牠們猖獗的時期，也就在這個季候。慮疾的傳播完全由於蚊蟲，而牠也是夏秋最多的東西。總之，人類身髒的健康，夏天所受的威脅要算最大，尤其是在人口擁擠的二個租界裹，要藥設備很難普及，每個家庭衛生常識更非每個居民所能明悉。往往因－個病者的忽視，引起了一家一弄，甚至漫延開來，弄得一發不可收拾。近年所不同者，就是頻添了十數萬的難胞，他們因爲受了戰事的影響，弄得無家可歸，　居在幽暗的破屋裏，幾十幾百的擠在一堆，沒有桌，沒有　，更沒有床，席地而臥，包含排泄，俱在一起，這樣的生活，怎麼可以担保沒有危險！如果一旦發生了傳染性的疾病很快地會遍佈到全所，自然會擴大到更廣的範圍，使租界裹的居民，加添了一重威脅，所謂城鬥失火殃及池魚，不過等到那個時候，再來高潮救濟，恐怕已經晚了。所以本會發起的泉旨，就是爲了使得大眾人民明瞭衛生常識，同時收集捐款，提成捐賣物品，協助難胞，改善他們的衛生設施，減少疾病的威脅，爲難胞謀安全，同時亦爲居住在租界上的幾百萬同胞謀安全。還望各界多加幫助！</p>

<h3>利用</h3>
<p>— 楊晋豪</p>
<p>希特拉利用了張伯倫的反共願望，與日意訂立了「反共協定」，打着反共先鋒的姿態，騙得英國的默契，併呑了中歐的奧捷，進而想侵掠東歐的波羅。</p>
<p>張伯倫利用了希特拉的「反共」作風，甘心讓小鬍子向中歐進軍，巴望他趕快奪取烏克蘭，而和斯太林打架，好坐待拔去眼中之釘的蘇聯，並得在兩敗俱傷之中，以收漁人之利。</p>
<p>誰知道「反共」的結果，是獨佔了弱小國家，並且要在英法頭上搶取殖民地，張伯倫爲免再上當起見，就利用斯太林，擺出一付「反侵掠」的面孔，假裝要訂立「英法蘇聯盟」，藉以壓迫希特拉就範，快把「反共」支票兌現，而由蘇聯去拚命。</p>
<p>斯太林却就利用了張伯倫的假情假意，在希特拉面前，巧弄手段，在商訂「英法蘇聯盟」的同時，與德國簽訂立「商務協定」而磋商起「互不侵犯條的」。這樣又利用了希特拉，以實行他的「和平」政策，讓那些帝國主義者去吵架，去火併。</p>
<p>國際間本只有利害之爭，決無思想之戰。不過，眼光有遠近之別，手段有巧妙不同罷了。</p>
<p>看來，最狡猾的是張伯倫，可是他的眼光最近視，手段最拙劣。「綏靖政策」，「慕尼黑會議」，在挑撥「反蘇」大戰的幻想中，再二再三地損害了他自己的利益，削弱了他自己的霸權。倘若他再要慷他國之慨，圖別人「上當」，那只有他自己再「慷慨」下去，再上當下去。</p>
<p>希特拉的利用張伯倫已經至矣盡矣，自然不用再喊什麼「反共」；現在是要惹到懦怯畏縮者的頭上，打起「反英」的旗幟來了。不過，要是他再冒險下去，果然足使英法吃癟，而自己也將由暴發戶而再變做破落戶。</p>
<p>還是斯太林手段最妙，把蘇聯從四面圍攻的「孤立」中，變成八面討好的「孤立」。今後的世界大戰已不是反侵掠的戰爭，而是帝國主義者的戰爭了。蘇聯決不進老狐狸們挑撥戰爭的圈套，倒要使帝國主義者們自己去打得頭破血流。這是現在斯太林的高見。</p>
<p>不過，這國際間互相利用的結果，到底將演成怎樣的局面，目前還不能預斷，且聽下回分解吧！</p>
<h3>樞紐</h3>
<p>— 子久</p>
<p>××酒樓第二號房間裏優游地坐着四位小聞人，作爲人物中心的是××貿易公司的李買辦。但是他很不舒服，因爲那個僅在××銀行裏當襄理的周××是個胖子，就是××洋行裏的邵庶務主任也是胖子？至於另外一個也是胖子，他呌金×，也在一家銀行裏幹副行長的，而李買辦却是瘦子，絕沒有一點紳士們應有的作風，所以當着這三位脚色，李買辦自己也不相信是擁有數十萬家財的紳士了。</p>
<p>把正經的事談妥了後，他們簡直無法消遺時光，這倒也很痛苦的。</p>
<p>忽然那個邵庶務主任放下了手裏的酒杯很感慨地說：</p>
<p>「趙××簡直豈有此理，他吃飽了飯專門在管閒事，七攪八攪的來向我繞脚不淸…」</p>
<p>接着又嘆了口氣。</p>
<p>李買辦一個「奇怪」，連忙就問：</p>
<p>邵翁，什麼事呢，趙××來向你繞脚。」</p>
<p>「哼，哼。」</p>
<p>鼻子裏響了一響，慢吞吞說：「說什麼難民所收容的難民，給養方面很困難……」</p>
<p>「是了，是了……」</p>
<p>副行長金××像武生從後台裏跳出似的搶着說：「我這邊也來的，眞是嘰哩咕嚕，說了一大套，難民什麼長，難民那末短，唉，我簡直聽也不高興聽……」</p>
<p>「眞不錯，誰高興去聽。」李買辦把吸進去的雪茄烟狠命地吐出來，他叉像從這烟霧中看見趙××給他的一封信來，他忿忿地說：「他眞像一個　善棍」，特地給我一封信，起初我還以爲他薦什麽買賣來了，誰知道……」</p>
<p>「什麼？　那庶務趕緊的問。</p>
<p>「還有什麼呢，」買辦說得很快，「還不是爲難民，眞討嫌，並且要我覆信呢！」又狠狠地吸了一口烟。</p>
<p>金×眏了映眼，他氣吼吼地說：</p>
<p>「李，他對你還算客氣哩。」</p>
<p>「客氣，哼。」對方冷冷的說。</p>
<p>「向我，他老實不客氣的開刀呢。」副行長把杯子用力地往桌上一損，「他叫我每個月認養難民十個……」</p>
<p>李買辦眉頭一皺想：「他養十個，我不是要養二十個了。」</p>
<p>「你們想看，他可惡不可惡？」副行長只是搖頭，「他爲難民這樣高興，難民是什麽東西？」</p>
<p>這時那個周襄理開口了，微甩着頭說：</p>
<p>「趙是我的遠房親，本來很客氣，那知昨天他來了，也是難民什麽，那麽的一大段，我簡直耐不住了，他却老着面皮也向我開刀了。」</p>
<p>「嗯，嗯。」</p>
<p>李買辦伸了仲懶腰。</p>
<p>「他銳現在汽油要賣到二元四角錢一加侖，叫我少開幾趟，就有一筆可觀的餘存，可以救濟難民了。你們想，難道叫我坐電車和公共汽軍不成？」</p>
<p>「是呀，是呀！」</p>
<p>李買辦摸着尖削的下巴。</p>
<p>庶務主任邵冷冷地說了：</p>
<p>「小周，他總算跟你商量呢。我，他却老街的來敎訓了。我的常跑跳舞塲，影戲院，不過是調劑工作的乾燥的。他後來竟然對我這樣說，少跳幾次舞，少看一二塲電影已經足够養一個難民的一月費用哩。眞眞豈有此理！」連連的嘆着氣，接着一陣子冷笑。</p>
<p>「他確實是有神經病的。」</p>
<p>李買辦閉着眼睛，突然張了開來，想一想，嗄聲喊：「　歐，僕歐。」</p>
<p>僕歐一隻老鼠似的溜了進來，直僵僵的站在他們前面。</p>
<p>「拿啤酒來；還打個電話到××社，呌她們快些。」</p>
<p>僕歐又直僵優的退了下去。</p>
<p>金×精神似乎有些不繼起來，呆呆地打了個呵欠，撲的跌倒在沙發上，揮了抓手。</p>
<p>痰盂嘆息了一聲：「嗤！」</p>
<p>暫别家鄉去將隨勝利來</p>

<h3>兩個盜匪</h3>
<p>— John　Aikin作　朱玉蓀譯</p>
<p>人物：亞力山大—著名的希臘元首</p>
<p>巴爾幹半島領袖—一個匪首</p>
<p>亞力山大（以後略作亞）：嚇！你是巴爾幹半島的盜匪嗎？關於你的事蹟，我已很知道了。</p>
<p>巴爾幹半島匪首（以後略作巴）：我是巴爾幹半島的島民，一個士兵。</p>
<p>亞：哼！士兵，只怕是賊，强盜，惡棍，社會的害蟲，我眞佩服你們的胆量；但是我憎恨你們，非責罰你不可。</p>
<p>巴：我做了什麽，你來控制我</p>
<p>巴：你不是蔑視我的權力，破壊公共的和平嗎？你的生活，不是完全在傷害你的同胞底生命和財產嗎？</p>
<p>巴：亞力山大！雖然我是你的囚犯，我必須聽你所歡喜說的話，忍受你賜給我的刑罰；但是我的心不能被屈服，如果我答辯你犯的種種罪惡，我可能解脫爲一個自由人？</p>
<p>亞：儘說！雖然我有權力制止你不說話，但我不屑這樣做。</p>
<p>巴：那麽，在回答你問話以前，我必須問你，你以前怎麽過着你的生活？</p>
<p>亞：一個英雄的生活！若是你問我名譽的話，他可完全吿訴你，我在勇敢者中，是最勇敢，在帝王中，我是最高貴，在戰勝者中，是最偉大的一個。</p>
<p>巴：我的名譽難道不是這樣麽？那裏有像我那樣勇敢的領袖？那裏有？——但我不屑吹牛，你得知道我不是可以輕易折服的啊！</p>
<p>亞：但是，你是什麽？你不過是一個盜匪，一個下流人，一個不誠實的盜匪罷了。</p>
<p>巴：戰勝者是什麽？你在這世界上不過是一個惡毒的狡獪者，你摧毀了和平。實業燦爛的果實，＿搶劫，復　，屠殺，拋棄法律，沒有正義，只知塡塞你對於疆土的無止的慾海，你不是如此麽？總共，我不過帮着近百的伙伴，在小的區域內活動而已，而你和你成千萬同僚的所爲，却影響着整個國家的命運。假使我是搶刧單身客人，那麼你是殺害了大衆，假使我是焚去了一些村莊，那麽你是毀滅，蹂躝了世界上最繁榮的國家和城市。你我的區別，不過我只是一個自私的我，你是一個皇帝，一個比我較强大的盜匪罷了！</p>
<p>亞：但是，我雖享受着皇帝的權利，我也以皇帝的待遇賜給別人，我雖破壊了都城，但我能建築起更大的；何况我在提倡藝術，商業，哲學！</p>
<p>巴：我難道不然麽？我取了富人的財產，但也很自然的佈濟貧人，我在兇惡的人們間，也樹起秩序，敎訓，我也伸出我的手，保護着被壓迫的同胞。的確，我對於你所說的哲學不大明瞭，但是我知道，即使你或我，必須要贖回你我在世界上所遺留的一半汚名。</p>
<p>亞：滾罷！難道我們是一樣的嗎？亞力山大是盜匪？讓我想想看！</p>

<h3>從「九陣風」　說到宋德珠（上）</h3>
<p>— 唯我</p>
<p>—並介紹戲校四生</p>
<p>消息傳來，一代宗匠的名武旦九陣風，（閻嵐秋）業於日前，病死故都，還不但是黎園界的一大損失，以後再要我一個像他那樣的武旦人才，是沒有的了。武旦一行，正因爲「難」所以學這一行的人不多，也因爲學這一行的不多，以致二十年來，九陣風外，再沒有一個像九陣風這樣的人才，武旦但能武一，不能算全才，貌須美，神須秀，唱須潤，技須巧，才是十全十美。九陣風不特武工技巧高人一等，而且有嗓子，有扮相，照樣動得了「小放牛」「虹霓關」「戰宛城」這一路，現在歸花旦應行的戲，九陣風在八年以前，養鬚退休，以敎戲娛晚境，富速成出科的朱盛富，閻世善，都得著他的敎授，現在九陣風是死了，有人說他的姪子閻世善，藝頗不弱，定能繼傳乃叔的衣缽，這話雖然也有幾分根據，但是世善萬難媲美嵐秋。他日能成九陣風第二，而稱得起十全十美之才的，應當還讓宋德珠了。</p>
<p>宋德珠，是北平戲曲學校的高材生，在校時，與趙金蓉，王和霖，王金璐，等同爲該校頭兒腦兒人物。德珠原學武旦，所以武工有相當的基礎。後來兼動花旦戲，因爲他的天資敏穎，也有相當的成就，德珠有扮相，有嗓子，身上台風，無一不佳，出手之技巧，翻跌之工夫，允有獨到。「兩狼關」之硬靠翻觔斗，可謂空前之作，其餘如虹橋贈珠」「忠烈鴛鴦「楊椒風」等劇，咸皆號召一時，此外更擅長刀馬旦戲，如「十三妹」「穆柯寨」「娘子軍」等戲，都是他的傑作。自從他畢業離校後，自組頴光社在平出演，據說什麽戲都唱，會經貼過「霸王別姬」「四郞探母」。這雖然顯見德珠的多才多藝，但是他唱這一路戲，實在不怎麼對工，不免要弄巧成拙，反而不美。徐碧雲在斌慶社坐科的時候，本來學的是武旦，不過碧雲的武旦戲，原不甚精，所以出科以後，他仗着嗓子有本錢，而改習靑衣花衫了。不過他所以棄本工於不顧，是環境把他造成功道樣的。德珠呢？武旦戲已經可以稱雄一時，兼動刀馬，本已多此一舉，現在還要動靑衣花衫的活兒；不但與理不合，實在有礙他的前途。李萬春所以不能傳楊小樓的代，就是因爲他喜歡賣弄本領，竟然連「捉放」「空城」都唱起來，這是一個大好前車之鑒，德珠應當三思而行。據說黃金大戲院，已將德珠邀妥，即將偕楊寳森來滬出演，我這裏很誠懇的希望他，接受我的意見演戲切不可越出範圍，德珠的私房戲不少，武旦和刀馬旦戲，最少有五十餘齣，德珠的武工旣佳，理應把武工供獻給觀衆，因爲余玉琴九陣風相繼作古，宋德珠實在是觀衆理想中的人物，希望德珠能够成功現代的余玉琴九陣風，不願意德珠去媲美四大名旦，這是我的意思。</p>

<h3>演劇經騐之一端（下）</h3>
<p>— 孫敏</p>
<p>談反派戲與正派戲難易問題</p>
<p>演反派角色是人演戲，演正派角色是戲演人。因爲每一部影片，無論劇本，畫面以及許多配角等種種方面，重心點多半集中在正派角色一人身上，而全用別人給他來作襯托的，所以演這一類角色是事半功倍，最容易博得觀衆的同情。反派角色的表演則是一切和他背道而馳，常使觀衆激起甚大的反感；同時這反感的力量，又正好是正派角色一種很大的帮助；換句話說：差不多就是在給正派角色做戲，例如反派戲做得越被觀衆痛恨，亦即給予正派角色更多的同情。所以，實際上的收獲，依然還是屬於正派角色；反派角色則常處於配角地位，且又易被忽視與勞而無功的。</p>
<p>就國際舞台現狀來說：德元首希特勒是一個反派名角，在一貫的侵略主義之下，倒行逆施，無所不為，他是多麽的兇狠；這樣的演戲演得有聲有色確屬十分吃力，可是他在觀衆方面的收穫，只有怨恨與咒駡，對他拍掌呌好的人是可說沒有的。另一方面美總統羅斯福是一位正派角色，他對希特勒手忙脚亂的暴行，以及强詞奪理的謬論，只須輕描淡寫地發上幾個主持正義的電報，一些不用多勞表演，便已博得舉世稱頌，為他唱彩不迭。很顯見的，這就是希特勒在反面給他做戲，要如沒有那位可恨的反派角色，亦即不足見此正派色之可敬可愛了。</p>
<p>總之，演正派戲是正常情形，反派戲則是反常的表現；其間難易之判，即此便已顯然明瞭。我從演慣正派戲後，改演了多年反派戲，關於此中况味，都早有過較深切的體騐。自己的意見，向來主張一個演員，該得能演多方面的角色。我於近數年來，演戲專屬反派一路，這全是環境關係，絕非出於自己的本願。說得深切一點，亦正是我心坎上的一件憾事。</p>

<p>安康二字，究作何解，初無定論，而俗稱之爲灘簧，則允不可思讓，惟予以爲南詞北曲，本以地名，越調秦腔，以及崑腔微調，即其最顯著者，皮簧亦同此例，安康二字，實爲臨安與建康二地名耳。南宋遷都於臨安，係由建康遞嬗而來，及至恭宗時，元伯顏入佔臨安，而在南京之行宮留守趙痻，已先棄建康而遁，文天祥由北營出，所作紀事七絕詩，逐首銜接，每首之前，均有一段白文，叙述當時情形甚詳，則其體制，正與今之說書彈詞，每唱一節，必停絃索，夾入道白或表白者，直無二致，是則安康爲文天祥之南詞遺制，信矣。至於灘簧二字，實為台黃之訛。文山全集中，即有可證，蓋自通州所乘海船，即是台州之三薑船，及自海舟登台岸，即先止於張哲齋家，僞稱劉氏。及過黃巖入天台境，始復其原姓名。然則紀事之詩，必至天台黃巖，而始發表，於是傳誧一時，遂成千古。南宋遺民，用以表揚信國之忠義，遂如武城之絃歌，推而至於其他類似之往史，固與三絃獨唱之盲詞，不可同日語也，旣爲南宋遺音，而非元音，故在亡國之後，乃有中原音韻之稱。或謂安康係唐人之遺音。夫如是云者，則不如上溯及晋，以東山絲竹之謝安，與竹林七賢之嵇康，爲其遠祖，豈不允妙，蓋凡吾杭之安康雅集本有七人，操三絃者例居首座，直是七賢之大阮爲尊也，故吾以爲三絃實爲阮耳，日本之三味綫亦即是阮，但其流傳於世。（未完）</p>

<h3>Europe's Crisis Looms: Britain and France Determined to Fulfill Pledge to Poland; Rumors Abound of Germany Intending to Reclaim Pre-War Territories; Chamberlain Sends Letter to Hitler with Grave Warning</h3>
<p>London: Following a cabinet meeting this afternoon, the cabinet immediately resolved: (1) to maintain its existing policy toward Poland; (2) to reconvene Parliament on the 24th of this month; (3) to mobilize all reserve forces of the army, navy, and air force. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>London: Following yesterday's cabinet meeting, Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, was instructed to call on Chancellor Hitler and personally deliver a private letter from Prime Minister Chamberlain, the contents of which were also communicated to the French and Polish governments. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: British Ambassador to Germany, Henderson, has already carried Prime Minister Chamberlain's private letter to Berchtesgaden to call on Chancellor Hitler. Political circles here believe that the content of the letter is a firm warning, stating that if Germany takes action against Poland, it will have a significant impact. The "war of nerves" is irrelevant to Britain. In addition, the British cabinet has reportedly decided to prohibit the export of certain raw materials. Therefore, rubber, cotton, and copper purchased by Germany in London recently may be difficult to transport to Germany. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The rumors circulating that German troops have been ordered to occupy Danzig and the Polish Corridor at dawn tomorrow are denied here today. Responsible parties have heard nothing of such plans. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: German sources now anticipate new developments following German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop's arrival in Moscow. They believe that the conclusion and signing of a German-Soviet non-aggression pact are only a matter of hours. After the signing, Germany will quickly implement its subsequent steps. In their opinion, Thursday will be an important date in European history, as German troops are now actively prepared and can mobilize at any time. German officials decline to predict future events, but well-informed German political figures believe that Germany intends to reoccupy all territories it held before World War I. While there is talk of partitioning Poland, the best-informed sources anticipate that an independent Polish state will still exist and will be guaranteed passage through Danzig and Gdynia to the sea to benefit its commerce. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Paris: According to reports received here, German troops are concentrating in various locations and will complete this process within three or four days. At that time, if Chancellor Hitler orders an attack, German troops will immediately attack Poland. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: A member of the National Socialist Party who correctly predicted the fate of Austria and Czechoslovakia stated last night that Poland is now "finished." Poland's future depends entirely on Hitler's will. If Poland accepts German conditions, Germany will only reclaim pre-war German territories. If Poland refuses, German troops will march directly on Warsaw. The mobilization of German reserves demonstrates Hitler's determination to recover lost territories. The tense situation in Europe will reach its peak when German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop signs the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. The Germans still hope that this crisis can be resolved in the same way as the Czech crisis last year. The neutrality of the Soviet Union and Germany's strategic advantage will deter Poland from resisting and entice Britain and France to use peaceful means to resolve the Danzig and Corridor issues. All parties here hope that the Soviet-German non-aggression pact can be further advanced to form a military alliance. This Soviet-German non-aggression pact has undoubtedly dealt a major blow to Britain and France, and the Anglo-Franco-Soviet military agreement will be impossible to conclude. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Danzig: National Socialist Party sources today predict that Danzig will be returned to Germany before the end of this week. The first public announcement by a local National Socialist Party leader regarding the date of Danzig's reunification with Germany is noteworthy. One National Socialist Party leader stated, "I believe there will be action within five days." Most National Socialist Party members believe that Germany will reoccupy Danzig after the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty is signed in Moscow. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Warsaw: According to official sources, although Germany and the Soviet Union intend to sign a non-aggression treaty, Poland will still resist aggression with all its might. Polish officials believe that the actions of Germany and the Soviet Union are "unexpected firecrackers in an international card game." According to Polish sources, Poland absolutely does not want to receive military assistance from the Soviet Union, as the threat posed by Soviet troops entering Poland is equivalent to that of the German troops occupying the territory. As for Poland's demands on the Soviet Union, they are limited to economic assistance only. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Military preparations have been actively underway on the Polish border recently. In the Upper Silesia and Voivodeship of Stratov districts, Polish troops are actively building fortifications. All roads approaching the German border have been trenched, and all bridges have been destroyed. (Haitong Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Decides to Take Emergency Measures: Extraordinary Parliament to Convene Today; Will Request Full Powers to Cope with Difficult Times</h3>
<p>London: The British Cabinet held a full meeting yesterday, lasting for quite some time. In the evening, an official announcement was issued stating that any German-Soviet non-aggression treaty would not affect its obligations to Poland. The British Parliament is scheduled to reconvene tomorrow, at which time both houses will pass the Emergency Powers (Defense) Act, allowing the Central Government to immediately implement any necessary plans when the situation requires. Currently, Britain is arranging precautionary measures, such as the mobilization of certain personnel from the army, navy, and air force, as well as dealing with the export of important raw materials and goods from Britain. Official sources announce that there is no reason to allow the dispute between Germany and Poland to escalate into a European war through the use of force, and there is no problem in Europe that cannot be resolved peacefully when confidence is restored. The British government is constantly preparing to create such a situation, but if Britain strives for this and other countries still insist on using force, then Britain is prepared and determined to resist to the end. The British Cabinet meeting concluded at 5:20 PM, lasting three hours and twenty minutes. Cabinet members appeared cheerful as they left 10 Downing Street. The crowd outside cheered loudly for all cabinet members, and the cheers for the Secretary of State for War, First Lord of the Admiralty and the Secretary of State for Air were particularly enthusiastic. It is reported that the Foreign Office was engaged in diplomatic activity throughout the day before the cabinet meeting. Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax and Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Sir Alexander Cadogan visited Prime Minister Chamberlain at 11:30 AM. Shortly thereafter, the Foreign Office's Chief Diplomatic Advisor Sir Robert Vansittart also went to the Prime Minister's residence. Halifax and Cadogan only left at 1:10 PM. German Chargé d'Affaires Kordt arrived at the British Foreign Office at 1:00 PM for consultations, and the Japanese Ambassador also arrived at the Foreign Office at 5:00 PM. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: All preparations for the convening of Parliament tomorrow have been completed. Last night, the radio station broadcast a notice in the news of its national program, summoning Members of Parliament to London for a meeting. Parliament is scheduled to convene at 1:45 PM tomorrow and will continue to meet during this tense situation. It is reported that the government will ask Parliament to fully pass the Emergency Powers (Defense) Act within one day, giving the government the power to take any steps to cope with difficult times and, if necessary, to act at any time without consulting Parliament. After the passage of this act, the British government will be in the same position as the French government, which now has almost dictatorial power. In other words, the various defense bills passed by Parliament during the Great War will be reimplemented. According to this act, military courts can try and punish those who violate the regulations for maintaining public order and national defense during wartime, and the naval and military administrative councils can take over the production of munitions or</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister Leads Entourage to Moscow Yesterday Afternoon: Negotiating Non-Aggression Treaty; Building a Foundation for Peace</h3>
<p>Moscow: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and his entourage arrived here at 1:00 PM today. Soviet Foreign Vice-Commissar Potemkin, Deputy Commissar of International Trade Khavanov, the Moscow Garrison Commander, representatives of the Moscow Municipal Government, and others welcomed them at the airfield. All personnel of the German Embassy and the Italian Ambassador to the Soviet Union also went to greet them. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, accompanied by many important officials from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, including Director of Protocol Doernberg and Director of the Eastern European Department Schalul, who recently represented Germany in signing the German-Soviet commercial agreement, flew to Königsberg (East Prussia) by special plane at 9:00 PM last night. He then transferred to Moscow at 7:00 AM this morning to prepare to sign a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet authorities. (Haitong Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: According to well-informed sources, German Foreign Minister's decision to go to Moscow is not only to sign a German-Soviet non-aggression treaty but also to agree with the Soviet Union on the scope of their respective interests. It is also said that during the negotiations, the German side will exchange views with the Soviet side in a frank and sincere manner. Germany's purpose is extremely upright and peaceful. What Germany hopes for is nothing more than building a foundation for peaceful and friendly relations. (Haitong Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>Berlin: Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima met with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop for half an hour last night before his departure for Moscow. It is reported that he inquired about the proposed German-Soviet agreement and the future of the Anti-Comintern Pact. (Reuters, 23rd) military supplies factories in whole or in part, and can also take over such factories. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Paris: The cabinet held a meeting this afternoon and made no decisions, only approving instructions to be sent to various ambassadors abroad. Afterwards, Premier Daladier met with Chief of the General Staff of National Defense General Gamelin and had a lengthy conversation with him. According to responsible sources, the attitudes of Britain and France have not changed. In other words, if violence occurs in Europe again in the future, they will definitely resist it. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Speculation on the Contents of the German-Soviet Pact</h3>
<p>Paris: The contents of the non-aggression treaty negotiated between Germany and the Soviet Union are still unknown. Diplomatic circles here are unwilling to express their opinions, only stating that from a legal point of view, the relations between Germany and the Soviet Union may not undergo significant changes due to the non-aggression treaty. The reason is that the two countries signed the Treaty of Rapallo on April 14, 1922, resolving their economic relations. Later, on April 22, 1926, they signed the Treaty of Berlin, which was also a treaty of friendship and neutrality. Article 2 stipulates that if one signatory country, even if it is peaceful, is attacked by a third country, the other party should maintain neutrality. Article 3 stipulates that if a third country organizes an economic group that is detrimental to one signatory country, the other party will not participate. Therefore, it seems that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty cannot add much to this. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The fact that Chancellor Hitler received Turkish Ambassador Papen in Berchtesgaden yesterday was announced at the same time as the news of the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, leading to general suspicion that Mr. Papen also participated in the German-Soviet negotiations. Haitong News Agency has learned from authoritative sources that this speculation is not consistent with the facts. Mr. Papen will not go to Moscow and has returned home due to his mother's death. His talks with the Chancellor and Foreign Minister in Salzburg were all about Turkish affairs. (Haitong Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<h3>French Embassy in Germany Urges Nationals to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Berlin: The French Embassy in Germany recently notified French nationals, urging them to return to their country. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Toshio Shiratori Calls on Italian Foreign Minister: Related to German-Soviet Pact</h3>
<p>Rome: Japanese Ambassador to Italy Toshio Shiratori visited Foreign Minister Ciano yesterday afternoon and discussed the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty. It is said that the Japanese government was dismayed upon hearing this. The general public here is commenting on this statement, saying that Japan can at least no longer provide assistance to its German and Italian allies. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Britain and France Decide to Suspend Trilateral Staff Talks: But Not to be Considered a Rupture</h3>
<p>Paris: According to the "Courage" newspaper, Paris and London have decided to act in complete unison and suspend the Moscow staff talks, but not to break them off. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: According to news from here today, the Anglo-French military delegation held a meeting, which was not attended by the Soviet side. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: Well-informed Soviet sources here today expressed the belief that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty would not conflict with the defensive alliance planned by the Soviet Union, Britain, and France. This statement is considered by qualified observers to be of great significance, as it indicates that the Soviet government still intends to continue the trilateral anti-aggression talks. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: According to a dispatch from the "Daily Mail's" Paris correspondent, the British and French governments last night instructed their ambassadors to the Soviet Union to inform Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov that Poland is now prepared to accept Soviet assistance. The reason for the stagnation of the Moscow trilateral talks was that Poland, in addition to accepting Soviet arms supplies, must also accept Soviet military assistance. The dispatch also stated that the British and French ambassadors will ask Molotov to reply as soon as possible. A Reuters dispatch from Moscow stated that British Ambassador Seeds met with Molotov last night for an hour, the content of which is unknown. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The British and French ambassadors in Moscow have asked Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov to show them the general contents of the proposed German-Soviet non-aggression treaty so that Britain and France can decide on their opinions regarding the staff talks. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>Paris: According to well-informed sources here, the military talks held by representatives of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow will continue to be held. According to Moscow, the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact does not mean that the trilateral talks cannot continue. However, these talks have been temporarily suspended yesterday. It is believed here that if they can be resumed, the representatives of Britain and France will not readily disclose military secrets. (Haitong News Agency, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Italy's Policy: Adhering to Original Course; Decides to Adapt to New Situation with "Realistic Spirit"</h3>
<p>Rome: Italy has quickly adapted to the new situation created by the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty with a "realistic spirit." Government authorities have not provided the public with any explanation as to why the policies of the Axis powers have suddenly shifted towards the Soviet Union. Newspapers emphasize that the Italian government's policy is still based on selectivity and adherence to its original course. A Foreign Ministry spokesman said, "If military action or a crusade-style war had been imposed on the Soviet Union in the past, Italy would certainly not have participated." Foreigners who hear all this are surprised. Observers say that the Soviet Union was ignored by Britain and France at last year's Munich Conference, and the Soviet Union's decision to negotiate a non-aggression treaty with Germany is to avenge this humiliation. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<h3>British Shipbuilding Program Reaches Peak: Three Ships Launched in Two Days</h3>
<p>London: The British shipbuilding program is accelerating, with three cruisers launched in two days, setting a new world record. Among the three cruisers, the "Nigeria" and "Mauritius" are 8,000-ton class, equipped with many 6-inch guns. The "Dido" is slightly lighter than the previous two but is also equipped with 6-inch guns. In the next few months, two 35,000-ton battleships equipped with 10-inch guns and two 23,000-ton aircraft carriers will be launched. Soon, four more cruisers and many destroyers will be launched. The British shipbuilding program has reached its peak. In a few months, a large fleet will actually be launched. There are 24 warships under construction on the Tyne River, with all shipyards working at full capacity. The cost of shipbuilding is estimated at US$350 million. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Malta: The barbed wire defense of the Malta coast has now been electrified, one of the military preparedness plans adopted by the authorities. All garrisoned soldiers are prepared to cope with any eventuality. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Many Shortcomings in British Food Management</h3>
<p>London: Sir William Beveridge, a key figure in the Food Ministry during the last Great War, said in a speech to the Norwich Industrial Transport Association that Britain's current food supply situation is worse than during the last Great War. "The government's 'Food Defence' Committee actually has no food to supply for it to manage. If there is food to be supplied, then there is no need for 'defence' at all. The committee's food control and distribution work is no different from that during the last Great War." Sir William Beveridge continued, "The government should quickly purchase wheat produced in Canada. Today, the British population has greatly increased compared to the past, but there are fewer merchant ships and the number of farmers has also greatly decreased. Increasing domestic food production is the most important thing for national defense today." (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Trade with Japan Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: According to a report from the Hong Kong Imports and Exports Statistics Department, Hong Kong's imports and exports totaled 96.5 million yuan, with imports at 50.8 million yuan and exports at 45.7 million yuan, both of which increased compared to the same period last year. Imports increased by 5.9% and exports by 24.5%. Imports from Japan were 3.11 million yuan, and exports were over 260,000 yuan, an increase of more than double. (Telegraph, 22nd)</p>

<h3>How to Eliminate Rice Panic</h3>
<p>The Shanghai rice problem, which has remained unresolved for a long time, has recently worsened. Not only has the price of rice far exceeded the limit set by the Public Works Department, but it is even becoming difficult to buy rice with money, gradually creating a sense of panic. This has caused great social unrest. Shanghai is currently home to over four million Chinese and foreign residents, and allowing this state of unrest to continue spreading would create a very serious social crisis.</p>
<p>The main reason why the Shanghai rice problem has not been resolved is the so-called manipulation of the special environment, which has disrupted the normal functioning of the supply side and allowed unscrupulous merchants to manipulate the sales side. In terms of supply, Shanghai's rice used to come from Wuxi and Changshu in the near vicinity, and from the Yangtze River region in the distance. Now, along the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, either farming cannot be carried out as usual, or the rice is bought up at the place of production, or exorbitant taxes are levied during transportation, or it is forcibly seized when it arrives near Shanghai. This makes it difficult for the rice to reach the Shanghai concessions. In terms of sales, since Shanghai became a special environment, the Chinese government has been unable to enforce its laws. As a result, unscrupulous merchants have been speculating and hoarding, deliberately raising rice prices in order to make huge profits. Although the Public Works Department has set price limits and rice industry groups have tried to curb price increases, these efforts have not been effective in practice. Recently, a very serious rice shortage has developed. Is it really the case that there is no rice left in the warehouses of Shanghai, and that the streets are truly bare? This cannot but make people suspicious!</p>
<p>To find a fundamental solution to the above-mentioned problems, unless the Chinese government can break this special environment in the future and enforce the law, this is currently not possible. However, in order to maintain social tranquility in Shanghai, we cannot but earnestly hope that the concession authorities and the people within the concessions will cooperate closely to prevent the development of panic through appropriate means. Yesterday, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession submitted a letter to the Public Works Department, suggesting three measures to solve the rice panic: (1) actively dredge the sources of supply; (2) gradually purchase and store rice, implementing price stabilization measures, with any losses temporarily covered by loans, and then seek to make up for them; and (3) investigate the rice stocks of all banks, money houses, warehouses, rice merchants, and individuals, ordering them to sell at the set price or half price within a set time limit. The third measure is actually the only emergency countermeasure at present; the first and second measures are longer-term policies to stabilize rice prices. However, in terms of the capabilities of the concession authorities, apart from the first measure, which requires consultation with relevant parties, the concession authorities have the possibility of immediately implementing the other two measures. Given the status of the concession authorities, it is expected that they will be able to lead the leaders of Shanghai's financial community to jointly raise funds for price stabilization measures, in order to benefit all residents within the concessions. The emergency measures taken by the concession authorities regarding rice after the "August 13th" incident two years ago are very commendable. It is perfectly acceptable to use the same method again to deal with the current situation. As for investigating rice stocks and forcing price stabilization sales, this is even easier to do. For the sake of the tranquility of all Shanghai residents, restricting the hoarding and monopolization of a small number of people has the same social significance as prohibiting opium and gambling. Moreover, the concession administrative authorities have the primary task of maintaining law and order within the concessions, and the rice problem is closely related to law and order. Therefore, the concession authorities have a major responsibility for solving the rice problem. Furthermore, it must be understood that if the concession authorities cannot show their strength on this issue, the concession will face other difficulties. In order to avoid these difficulties, the concession authorities should promptly implement these effective solutions to the rice problem, which is related to law and order.</p>
<p>We also want to solemnly tell the hoarders: at this time and in this place, everyone should be able to replace the laws of the Chinese government with compassion. The current Shanghai is like a lone boat in the ocean, and everyone should help each other in the spirit of sharing the same boat and waiting for the final victory in a difficult environment. Do not imitate the behavior of pirates, taking this opportunity to rob others. It must be understood that human survival is collective, and the chaos of the entire society does not allow for the existence of individual safety. We should immediately awaken, sacrifice the small self, and give up the attempt to speculate and profit. Even if we seek profit, we should not target rice as a means of monopolization. We also hope that the Shanghai rice industry and people from all walks of life can use collective power to thoroughly investigate the rice speculation situation in the Shanghai market, and impose social sanctions on a small number of unscrupulous merchants based on humanitarian justice. Use the police force of the concession to sell the hoarded rice in various warehouses at fair prices to eliminate the current panic. In addition, the banking and money industries, which are closely related to the rice industry, should, on the one hand, report the bad apples in the industry and not sit idly by as they use public deposits to engage in hoarding activities that are detrimental to society. It must be known that they are pests in society and black sheep in the banking and money industries, which will adversely affect the entire banking and money industries! At the same time, loans must be issued carefully and not be used by speculators. Not only that, but the banking and money industries should also gather their peers, invite public organizations, and cooperate with the concession authorities and the residents of the concession in the procurement and distribution of rice on as large a scale as possible, in order to solve the current food problem, which is also the way to eliminate the social crisis. As for the residents: first, they should not store excessive amounts of rice, so as not to help the schemes of unscrupulous merchants and increase the severity of the problem; second, they should not act rashly, so as not to promote social unrest; third, they should either take the household as a unit, or organize consumer cooperatives, and first find ways to solve the rice problem individually, and try to change to eating various coarse grains. We will target the seriousness of the rice problem and everyone will be responsible. Whether it is eating noodles, wheat, or even sweet potatoes and taro, deciding every few days is good, and doing so every day is even better. In wealthy families, they are not worried about the high price of rice, but it is a reasonable approach to change to eating bread and biscuits, which are more expensive than rice, for the sake of the public who lack rice.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Massing on Hong Kong Border; British Troops Demolishing Several Bridges; Authorities Order British Residents in Kowloon to Relocate; Japanese Troops Landing at Nantou Repelled</h3>
<p>Hong Kong: Reuters has learned that some of the bridges connecting the Chinese territory to the British territory have been ordered to be demolished. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Japanese troops are massing outside the Hong Kong border. Today, four Japanese patrol ships arrived at Nantou, and many armed small boats continued to arrive at Taishan Bay outside Nantou. British and Indian military police are still patrolling within the border line. The border is currently peaceful. Reuters learned from non-official sources that foreign women and children residing in the New Territories have been instructed by the authorities to move to the city to prevent unforeseen events. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Today's English-language newspapers here reported that the British military authorities have cut off the bridges leading to the Shenzhen River. British people living near the border have been advised to either move to Kowloon or to the mainland to avoid unforeseen events. It is said that Japanese troops continue to land at Nantou, carrying heavy artillery and machine guns. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Shaoguan reports that Japanese troops on Hainan Island have been mobilized and increased, and it is rumored that they will harass Beihai and Yangjiang. The Japanese landing at Nantou was repelled. The fighting in Sanjiang is still fierce. Japanese troops in Muzhou have returned to Japanese boats. Transportation between Macau and Siyi has been interrupted. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: This afternoon, the British military authorities here ordered the demolition of two bridges on the Kowloon border facing the Japanese troops. At the same time, British residents now in Kowloon were advised to move to Hong Kong as early as possible. Hong Kong government officials believe that this is purely a precautionary measure. According to sources close to the government, the Hong Kong government's actions are due to two reasons: first, heavy troops have been gathered on the Japanese side of the Kowloon border; second, four Japanese cruisers arrived in Taishan Bay across from Nantou this morning. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Japanese have built two artillery forts in Shenzhen and fortifications on the hilltop near the railway station, confronting the New Territories. The situation on the Sino-British border is becoming increasingly tense. The Hong Kong authorities have notified British women and children living in Fanling to evacuate the area, saying that this is a defensive measure. The bridges at key points on the border have also begun to be removed. (Special dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: A Chinese military spokesman reported on the actions of Japanese troops near Hong Kong at yesterday's weekly intelligence conference, and said that the activities of Japanese warships near Hainan Island prove that the Japanese army intends to invade Beihai. Regarding the battle situation in Shanxi, the spokesman declared that the Japanese army's plan to break through the Shanxi guerrilla units with infantry had failed, and that they have now switched to bombing. However, due to the undulating mountains, this tactic is also difficult to be effective. The war situation on the central China front is very quiet, with only minor skirmishes by guerrilla units. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Luoyang: The Central News Agency reporter recently interviewed a commander who previously served under the former Qian Supervisor. According to him, five divisions of Japanese troops, totaling about 100,000 men, were mobilized in southeast Shanxi and harassed the entire highway. After fierce interception by the Chinese army, the strongholds have been recovered one after another. Recently, Jincheng, the last city, was also surrounded by the Chinese army from all sides and captured in one fell swoop in ten days. In total, the Japanese army suffered 15,000 to 20,000 casualties. After this major blow, not only was the dream of "sweeping away" the guerrilla base area of ​​the Taihang Mountains shattered, but it will also be unable to commit any more crimes in the short term.

<h3>Anti-British Movement Intensifying</h3>
<p>Beiping: Leng Jiaji, chairman of the Anti-British Association of Beiping, told Japanese and Chinese journalists yesterday that British residents in Beiping must immediately give up their rented residences, or they will face more inconveniences. Unless Britain accepts the demands of the Anti-British Association, the association will take "indirect action" against British residents, such as stopping the supply of telephones, water, and garbage collection. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Beiping: The film "The Little Princess," starring Shirley Temple, was suspended from screening at the Pingan Cinema here yesterday because the cinema manager received a notice from the Japanese military police and the Chinese police that "this kind of pro-British film is a crime of treason." (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Beiping: The anti-British movement here has undergone a new transformation. Now, famous buildings are being used for propaganda purposes. Countless anti-British posters have been pasted all over the famous Temple of Heaven. The Sino-British Theatre has been closed due to the activities of the vigilantes. These vigilantes threatened Chinese people and advised them not to enter the theatre. Other vigilantes went upstairs to attack the theatre manager's office because the theatre is now showing "The Little Princess," starring Shirley Temple, which they oppose because they believe the film has a pro-British stance.

<h3>Severe Flooding in Tianjin; Japanese Residents Flee to Beiping</h3>
<p>Beiping: The Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin has become a waterborne event as a result of the flooding. According to visitors, Japanese soldiers are doing their best to maintain the blockade, with sentries stationed in front of all obstacles on boats or motorboats. Although the operation of the Pingjin Railway is now greatly delayed, it is still being maintained. Two trains arrived yesterday, delayed by several hours, fully loaded with evacuees, including 600 Japanese people from the Japanese concession in Tianjin. It is said that the flooding in the Japanese concession is more severe than elsewhere. It continued to rise last night, and the streets are deeply flooded. There is still water supply in the British concession in Tianjin, but there is no electricity. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Beiping: Six hundred Japanese residents of Tianjin, in view of the fact that the flooding of the foreign concessions in Tianjin will continue to rise by the end of this week, came here last night to seek refuge. People from third countries will also arrive here in the next few days. Food prices have risen sharply due to the continuous arrival of refugees, but the food shortage here has been slightly alleviated due to the arrival of 500,000 bags of Australian flour from Tianjin. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tianjin: The commander of the Japanese army in Tianjin issued a statement yesterday afternoon, asking the people to cooperate with the local Japanese officials to prevent floods, and said that the authorities will do their best to maintain law and order, traffic, and provide disaster relief. Anyone living in Tianjin, whether Chinese, Japanese, or from a third country, will be able to receive assistance. This statement also announced that the following persons will be punished: (1) those who rebel against Japan and those who instigate rebellion against Japan; (2) those who break into other people's houses, or rob or set fires; (3) those who spread rumors; (4) those who hoard food or deliberately raise prices; and (5) those who do not obey the orders of the commander of the Japanese garrison. The statement also advised the victims to move to safe locations outside Tianjin. Special trains are available at Tianjin North Station to transport the victims out of the country. The seven checkpoints around the British concession are still maintained as usual by small boats. The Italian concession was not flooded, while the Japanese, French, and British concessions were all flooded. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tianjin: Today, due to the continued heavy rain, the water in the low-lying areas is already ten feet deep. The situation of the thousands of refugees who have taken refuge in the British and French concessions is extremely pitiful. The terrain of the Italian concession in Tianjin is the highest in Tianjin, so it has become an "island" in Tianjin, but the Italian concession is already full of refugees, so it can no longer accommodate the relocation of refugees. Most Japanese are now trying to leave here to go to Beiping. It is reported that 600 people have arrived in Beiping. However, it is widely rumored here that the tracks have been washed away by the water in several places, so British residents who want to go to Beiping can only postpone their departure for the time being. It is also reported that 500,000 bags of foreign flour from Tianjin have been transported to Beiping, so the food supply here will become a major problem. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Plans to Make Another World Peace Appeal; US Government Discussing Neutrality; American Residents in Europe Preparing to Evacuate</h3>
<p>Washington: After the sudden worsening of the European situation, President Roosevelt, who was originally cruising in the Pacific Ocean, has returned here and will arrive on the 25th, and may make a final effort for peace. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Washington: According to news from here today, President Roosevelt will again make a call for saving peace, similar to the one made last September. Because in addition to instructing the competent authorities to make detailed reports on the European situation, President Roosevelt will also suspend his summer vacation and return to Washington on Friday. However, Secretary of State Hull returned here today, and Acting Secretary of the Navy Edison, Undersecretary of the Army Johnson, Chief of Staff Marshall, Secretary of the Air Force Arnold, and Deputy Chief of Protocol Bailey of the State Department all met with Undersecretary of State Welles to discuss the issue of US neutrality and how to protect the safety of American residents overseas. According to Polish Ambassador to the United States Puyotoki's visit to Welles, Poland is determined to fight to defend its territory. (Associated Press dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington: The European situation suddenly became tense. Under Secretary of State Welles convened senior officials from various government departments this afternoon to study the two issues of maintaining the neutrality of the United States in wartime and protecting the lives and property of American expatriates in Europe. Representatives of the Federal Shipping Board immediately declared that the plan to evacuate American expatriates in Europe has already been drafted. (Havas dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>Washington: When officials here first heard the news that Germany and the Soviet Union had agreed to conclude a non-aggression treaty, they were shocked. Now that the shock has subsided, they are reconsidering and feel that the disaster is not as serious as they initially thought. Because the State Department has not yet learned its contents, it does not want to make any criticism of this. However, well-informed sources enumerated the following points as slightly reassuring: (1) Since the Soviet Union has asked Britain for a high price, it may not give Germany a free hand in Eastern Europe and abandon its right to demand a considerable price; (2) Is it in the interest of the Soviet Union for Germany to continue its aggression in Eastern Europe? The Soviet Union has not failed to know this; (3) Hitler has weakened the anti-communist front and put Japan in the Far East in a dangerous situation that can withstand stronger resistance from China and the Soviet Union. The price he paid is indeed not small. The above third section often makes American people satisfied, but there is a regret that can offset it, that is, although the aggression in the Far East has been frustrated, the European peace front, allowing it is British diplomacy, has suffered a serious blow. President Roosevelt has repeatedly wanted to strengthen British diplomacy in recent months. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: Government officials here believe that if the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty is established, the Soviet Union may take a leap and dominate the situation in the Far East. At the same time, the prosperity of the Soviet Union's power in the Far East is also enough to increase the position of the United States in the East. Furthermore, after the Soviet Union gets rid of the constraints in Europe, it will be easier to help China from now on. However, in order to obtain compensation from China, the big ones will require China to continue to make concessions to communism. In short, it is very clear that the Soviet Union's action is to avoid fighting a major war in Europe and is willing to fight a smaller war in the Far East. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Washington: The US government is preparing to evacuate expatriates from European countries. It is said that there are more than 100,000 American expatriates in European countries. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Germany and the Soviet Union Join Hands; Japan is Perplexed and Distraught; Oshima Ordered to Inquire About Germany's True Intentions; Prime Minister and Army Minister Discuss Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Tokyo: After Berlin announced the news that Germany and the Soviet Union were about to sign a non-aggression treaty, the Japanese government instructed Ambassador to Germany Oshima to inquire about Germany's views. As soon as news is received, a cabinet meeting will be held to study the new situation and may take decisions with significant meaning. (Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Regarding the conclusion of the non-aggression treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany, the Japanese government authorities are quite embarrassed and distressed. Therefore, they will immediately ask Germany to explain the meaning of its surprising move. According to Japanese reports, Foreign Minister Arita will first inquire about Germany's "true intentions," and then the Japanese cabinet will reconsider its European policy. Most Japanese newspapers are instructed by the government to write articles saying, "The diplomatic relations between Germany and Japan have always been cordial. Now we are surprised to hear the news that Germany has taken new actions, and everyone feels extremely regret." Although Japanese newspapers admit that diplomatic policy may need to be revised, most newspapers insist that the new treaty "may not contradict" the anti-communist agreement. It is said that Prime Minister Hiranuma will meet with Army Minister Itagaki this afternoon in order to reach a preliminary decision on future European policy. However, according to well-informed sources, Hiranuma and Itagaki will definitely discuss the inevitability of changing the entire diplomatic policy. Prince Konoe Fumimaro, President of the Privy Council, rushed back to Tokyo last night in order to discuss countermeasures with government leaders. He will probably discuss solutions with Prime Minister Hiranuma this afternoon. (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side Denies Brewing Cabinet Reshuffle</h3>
<p>Tokyo: Semi-official Japanese sources here claim that the rumors that a cabinet reshuffle is about to occur are completely untrue. (Reuters dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Prime Minister Hiranuma and Army Minister Sakamoto had a secret meeting for several hours this afternoon. Afterwards, the Prime Minister also met with the President of the Privy Council, so there were widespread rumors that the cabinet might be reorganized. However, government officials have denied this rumor. At the same time, diplomatic envoys from France, Poland, and the United States visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs one after another to inquire about the Japanese government's countermeasures to the new situation in Europe. According to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, "Although the situation in Europe has changed, it does not affect Japan's established policy. We are not very concerned about the changes in the European situation." The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs admitted that the Japanese government had no prior knowledge of the new changes in Europe. The news that the Japanese government received was the report from Ambassador Oshima in Germany yesterday. As for the details of Germany's willingness to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received a report, so it cannot express its opinion. "However, we hope that the non-aggression treaty signed by Germany and the Soviet Union will not conflict with the tripartite anti-communist agreement." (Associated Press dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Abnormal Activities in Tokyo Diplomacy</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Today, both the Japanese diplomatic and political circles are extremely active. The Polish Ambassador to Japan visited Foreign Minister Arita this morning. Shortly after, French Ambassador Henry visited Foreign Vice-Minister Sawada. The Polish Embassy's Counselor, Michalowski, also visited the Director-General of the European Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Simultaneously, government leaders held important meetings to discuss the new situation in Europe. Prime Minister Hiranuma had a closed-door meeting with Army Minister Itagaki this afternoon. It is reported that Itagaki presented the Army's frank opinions to Hiranuma. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>How to Dissipate Isolation</h3>
<p>Tokyo - When the spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs met with reporters this morning, he acknowledged the possibility of a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Japan. It is claimed that Japan's policy is to oppose communism to defend the Japanese Empire, and this policy is unchangeable. Japan is currently awaiting more detailed information from Berlin regarding the proposed non-aggression terms between Germany and the Soviet Union. Therefore, when reporters questioned this matter, the spokesperson cautiously replied that it is currently impossible to accurately interpret the overall situation. However, we hope that Germany will not take measures that contradict the anti-communist pact. It is still unclear whether the new German-Soviet treaty is a new direction for us or a revival of the previous Soviet-German non-aggression treaty. Someone asked, "If the anti-communist pact is not against the Soviet Union, then who is it against?" The spokesperson gave an evasive answer, only saying that the anti-communist pact "is still a living tool." However, the spokesperson believes that the possibility of a breakdown in German-Soviet negotiations is quite low. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Eastern Reports Acknowledge Facing Difficulties</h3>
<p>Tokyo - Today, newspapers here published editorials on the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, believing that it will not only affect Europe but also the Far East. Japan's Hirochi Newspaper stated that the Soviet Union will act freely in the Far East because it is rumored that this treaty will effectively sweep away the anti-communist pact. The only glimmer of hope that Germany provides regarding this matter is that Germany had foreseen all possibilities and considered its relationship. The meaning of this message may vary, but policy changes in history are most surprising. Aside from that, nothing else is different. If the Soviet-Japanese non-aggression treaty proposed by Moscow is realized, then the required transformation will not be considered significant. With the guarantee of no attacks from both the East and West, the Soviet Union can sit back and watch the world kill each other while building up its production capacity, selling goods to belligerent countries to become rich, and waiting for the time to spread its communism amid world turmoil. The Daily News stated that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty is bound to affect the Far East, and the government should carefully inspect the new situation, not be driven by emotions, firmly adhere to the strategy of independent action, and focus on the satisfactory resolution of the China Incident. The Asahi Shimbun stated that Germany wants to obtain a bloodless solution to the Danzig problem and wants to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union, which must also pay attention to the Far East. Regardless of the consequences, Japan must carry out its work of creating a new order in East Asia and does not need to pay much attention to the new changes in the European situation. The Yomiuri Shimbun stated that Chamberlain's realistic policy is not as advanced as Stalin's more advanced realistic policy. "Kokumin Shimbun," which advocated joining the Axis military alliance, did not comment on the German-Soviet treaty, but said that Japan, two years into the war in China, is now gradually encountering real difficulties. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Chongqing Newspaper Observes Benefit to China</h3>
<p>Chongqing - This morning, newspapers here published the news that the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty is about to be signed in a particularly prominent position and expressed unanimous opinions, saying that the rapprochement between the two countries will be beneficial to China's resistance against Japan. The Central Daily News, a Chinese government agency, stated that the new changes in the international situation may shock Britain and France, but it can be safely predicted that the Soviet Union will continue to exert pressure for world peace and will continue to support the collective security plan. Japan is now isolated and helpless, and it will be at a loss as to what kind of foreign policy it should adopt in the future. The "Wipe Out" newspaper, an organ of the Chinese Army, expressed optimism about the news of the Soviet-German rapprochement, as did Chinese people in Shanghai and other places. The newspaper attached great importance to the news of the Soviet Union's troops stationed on the "Manchuria" border. The Xinmin Daily News stated that the Soviet Union decided to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Germany in the hope of peace. This treaty does not conflict with the anti-aggression alliance of Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. Therefore, even though Germany and the Soviet Union have come closer again, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union are still expected to conclude an agreement in the near future. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Major Failure of British Diplomacy</h3>
<p>London - Evening newspapers here commented on the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, all saying that the effectiveness of this resolution cannot restrict the Soviet Union's actions when Germany invades a third country. This point is particularly emphasized by the newspapers. "The Standard" stated that this treaty is bound to make the European situation worse. The German side believes that the treaty has been concluded, but the Soviet Union believes that Ribbentrop's visit to Moscow is only the beginning of negotiations. The establishment of a treaty between the Soviet Union and Germany is the culmination of the Soviet Union's isolation policy after Litvinov's departure. "The News Evening Post" commented that it was a major failure of British diplomacy, but the determination of Britain and France to fulfill their obligations is not weakened by this. All newspapers unanimously believe that this treaty is a major blow to Japan. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>London - "The Manchester Guardian" published an article today criticizing the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, stating that if this news is surprising to Europe, it must be shocking to Japan. This treaty may not be of much value, and if it is not beneficial to Germany, it will not harm Japan. However, even if this situation is true, the Japanese government will find it difficult to trust Germany's future assistance. If Germany is willing to sacrifice Japan's interests in the Far East for its own benefit, then Germany is obviously willing to do so. Japan, understanding this situation, will definitely think twice before taking on supporting Germany's ambitions in Europe. Currently, Japan views Germany as Britain views the Soviet Union. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>German Newspapers Comment with Complacency</h3>
<p>Berlin - Regarding the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, newspapers here began to write detailed commentaries last night. The general tone is that the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact is a manifestation of Germany's realistic diplomatic policy, and it is also the direct result of Britain's rejection of reaching an understanding with Germany and pursuing a policy of encirclement. Newspapers traced the historical events of the 19th century when Prussia, Austria, and Tsar Alexander I cooperated to deal with Napoleon, and Bismarck provided a guarantee treaty to Russia, the friendship between Germany and the Soviet Union. The "Hamburg Local Daily" stated that "Britain's hesitation ultimately led to the failure of the long-running Moscow talks, which further demonstrated Germany's ability to seize opportunities and take appropriate actions. Germany will never allow its traditional rights to be deprived. The conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact is the inevitable result of the encirclement policy. Countries advocating the encirclement policy have always believed that Germany and the Soviet Union are incompatible and that conflicts will inevitably occur sooner or later. They did not expect that Germany and the Soviet Union would restore the traditional friendly relationship before Bismarck stepped down, and this relationship continued for several years after the World War." The "Berlin Evening Post" commented that "Germany and the Soviet Union have no territorial disputes. From now on, democratic countries should recognize that the fate of Europe is in the hands of the Axis powers." "The German General Report" commented that European politics and the world situation have now been changed. Germany has repeatedly declared to the world that Germany will never allow the history of the European War to repeat itself today and in the future. It has now been seen in fact. The German people express their extreme welcome to the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, which is transforming the world situation." The newspaper then quoted British Lloyd George as saying, "If the peace front does not include the Soviet Union, it will become an empty organization without political and military value." Indeed, Britain has now lost this opportunity to oppose Germany's continental policy. (Haitong Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspapers Write Articles to Vigorously Praise</h3>
<p>Rome - "Italian News" editor Gaida recently published an article in the newspaper commenting on the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact. The article stated, "Poland is now isolated. If Britain and France still want to fulfill their guarantee obligations to Poland, they cannot obtain Soviet assistance. The news of the conclusion of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact came suddenly and was truly surprising. However, Italy had previously warned Poland of the crisis in its geographical location and that the millions of Ukrainians and Belarusians within its borders were a source of unrest. Britain and France have been negotiating to conclude an agreement with the Soviet Union for four months, and nothing has been achieved. But German leader Hitler made a move that determined the overall situation. The world situation changed in an instant." (Haitong Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Suspect and Uneasy about the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Paris - The commentaries in today's French newspapers are largely similar to yesterday's. The Times has always taken a pro-Soviet stance, but today it also published a lengthy editorial, believing that the Soviet Union's conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with Germany is like stabbing a friendly country with seven heads, which is chilling. Most French newspapers believe that it is difficult to speculate on the background of the Soviet Union's adoption of a new policy, and perhaps there will be further surprising changes. (Haitong Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Paris - French newspapers now say that Moscow is indecisive and has recently established trade ties with Germany. Therefore, the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty was expected. This treaty may not produce the results that Germany expects. "The Paris Times" referred to this as a major change in policy and doctrine in European history, saying that the German government is in a desperate situation and has to open up new paths. Although the non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union contradicts the essence of all things, it is the safest way to prevent the establishment of a military alliance between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. This move is indeed bold, but it is unlikely that the desired results will be achieved. This treaty has clearly eliminated the anti-communist pact, and any plans that Germany intends to extend its influence to the Balkan countries, Ukraine, or the Black Sea will be shelved as a result. People cannot help but have a view that Hitler, after realizing that he is in a difficult position, wants to use lightning-fast means to resolve the crisis he has created and make a strategic withdrawal. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Soviet Air Force Bombing on the Manchurian Border Intensifies</h3>
<p>Changchun - Japanese troops here announced today that since the news of the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty was announced, the bombing attacks by the Soviet Air Force in "Manchukuo" have intensified compared to before. On Monday, the day the news was announced, there were four Soviet aircraft raids. Japanese aircraft immediately took off to meet the enemy and engaged in large-scale air combat. The conflict on the Soviet-"Manchuria" border has been continuous every day since May 21. It is determined that the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty will allow the Soviet Union to have no worries in the West, and in the Far East, it can act freely. The Japanese side admits that the hidden worries for the future will inevitably grow. Five Japanese aircraft failed to return after the air combat on Monday. The Japanese report did not specify the air combat zone, but the conflict zone on Sunday morning was known to be in the Harlun-Erel Mountain area, an important railway point on the Outer Mongolian border. The Japanese side claimed that a total of forty-six Soviet aircraft were shot down in the air combat on Sunday. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Vladivostok Shipyard's Newly Built Warships Will Soon Join the Pacific Fleet</h3>
<p>Moscow - The first new Soviet warship built by the Vladivostok Shipyard will soon join the Pacific Fleet. The contents of the ship are unknown to outsiders, but it is said that there are thousands of shipyard workers, which shows that it must be a giant warship. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Secretly Investigate Philippine Minerals</h3>
<p>Manila - According to the Philippine News, Japanese disguised as fishermen are very active along the coast of Surigao Province. In fact, these fishermen are mostly geologists, intending to investigate the minerals in the Tinaga area. In the past month, a 40-ton yacht was often seen off the coast of Tinaga, pretending to be fishing. At the same time, several local Filipinos acted as guides for the Japanese on the ship, venturing deep inland. When local police inquired about what was going on, they would avoid the yacht and sail to the location of the large ship outside the harbor. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Netherlands Calls Up Reservists</h3>
<p>The Hague - In view of the recent changes in the international situation, the Dutch government yesterday issued a decree to call up reservists, including the Coast Guard, Border Guard, and Air Force (Every Day Telegraph, 23rd)</p>

<h3>London High Court Rejects Habeas Corpus Case, British Foreign Secretary's Representative Presents Views in Court</h3>
<p>London - High Court Judge Cassels today rejected the application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of the four Tianjin suspects. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>London - Regarding the writ of habeas corpus case for the four Tianjin suspects, High Court Judge Cassels opened the trial again this morning. The lawyers for the application were Sir Monckton and two civilians, while Walker represented Foreign Secretary Halifax. When Walker continued his argument today, he submitted a book obtained from the Foreign Office to the judge, which contained various treaties related to British-Chinese relations. Walker stated that Britain has no other rights in China except those based on various treaties. The plan to extend habeas corpus to non-British Empire people is unheard of. In fact, this power only belongs to the British King over his own people, but not over non-British people. Sir Monckton, the lawyer for the application, responded to Walker's mention of the position of the Aid China Movement Committee, saying that Lord Listowel personally cares about the safety of the four Tianjin suspects and has obtained the entrustment of these four people to apply for a writ of habeas corpus on their behalf. He has received a telegram from Attorney Issembert in Tianjin, stating, "The four suspects have commissioned you as their representative." (Reuters, 23rd)</p>
<p>London - When High Court Judge Cassels handled the petition for a writ of habeas corpus today, Foreign Secretary Halifax's representative, Walker, insisted that the detention of the four suspects in the British Concession in Tianjin was based on a treaty, so this was a national action. As for whether it was based on the treaty, the court could not investigate. The Foreign Office has received notification from the Chinese local court in the last 48 hours that it is prepared to welcome the extradition of the prisoners. No one wants to see the prisoners extradited until the court makes a ruling on the current case. The case is scheduled to continue tomorrow (Reuters, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Signs of Economic Panic in Japan: Gold Reserves and Raw Material Stockpiles Both Decreasing</h3>
<p>Moscow - The Red Star newspaper recently published an article entitled "Signs of Economic Panic in Japan," which reads:</p>
<p>"The Japanese warlords have used inflation and increased taxes to exploit the working masses and actively promote dumping policies in the world market, resulting in the extreme prosperity of their war industry and its affiliated sectors. However, this has resulted in an abnormally unbalanced nature of its entire economic development. On the one hand, industrial production has increased, while on the other hand, agriculture has been extremely backward, and the purchasing power of the people has become weaker. At the same time, although the production of means of production has also made some progress, the production of consumer goods has sharply declined during wartime. Judging from the Japanese statistics, an economic recession in Japan did indeed begin in 1938, and by the end of the same year, the extreme recession had affected the production of means of production.</p>
<p>The reduction of Japan's gold reserves and raw material stockpiles is also one of the important signs of future panic. To date, Japan has used almost two-thirds of its gold reserves, and the remaining gold available to pay foreign countries is only enough for the next year.</p>
<p>The sharp increase in Japan's war spending has gradually exhausted its finances and economy. According to the clearly exaggerated estimates of the Japanese "Oriental Economist" magazine, Japan's total national income in 1939 was only 20 billion yen, while this year's national budget expenditure reached a huge 10 billion yen, of which direct war spending accounted for 7 billion yen. Taxes and other items have increased by 150% this year, reaching 2.5 billion yen in this year's budget. The total amount of domestic public debt was only 4 billion yen a few years ago, but this year it will exceed the total amount of total national income. Furthermore, the total amount of war spending to date has reached 12 billion yen, and thereafter, 500 million yen will be required each month.</p>
<p>The expansion of agricultural panic occupies an extremely important position in the general severity of the economic situation. Currently, 50% of the young men of conscription age have been sent to the front lines, and a large number of farmers have left the countryside to work in arms factories. One-third of the country's horses have been commandeered for war. Agricultural production has sharply declined, so the signs of industrial panic complement those of agriculture.</p>
<p>Japanese imperialists are now striving to further implement the total mobilization of the entire national economy to meet wartime needs. This measure may delay the outbreak of panic, but when the Japanese economy is completely exhausted by the war and panic cannot but break out, its impact will be even more serious."

<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Chongqing Suburbs; 27 Aircraft Drop Dozens of Bombs; Chinese Planes Ascend to Engage, Japanese Planes Escape</h3>
<p>Chongqing - Tonight, 27 Japanese planes dropped dozens of bombs on the refugee reception area in the southwestern suburbs of Chongqing and the residences of residents recently evacuated from the city. The Japanese planes came in two batches, one appearing at 7:30 and the other at 7:45. The number of casualties is expected to be very large because there is a lack of air-raid shelters and bomb shelters here. After the Japanese bombing, three fires broke out, but they were extinguished by the fire brigade within half an hour. The air raid warning was issued at 6:30. Two squadrons of the Chinese Air Force ascended to patrol, but the sky was clear and moonlit, so the Japanese planes were able to find their targets and drop bombs suddenly. After dropping the bombs, the Japanese planes fled northeast. Chinese planes followed closely behind, but there are no reports of any being shot down. Five minutes after the warning was lifted, the shops reopened and business continued as usual. (23rd Associated Press dispatch)</p>

<h3>Zi Lin West Daily Commentary: German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact Should Not Lead to Pessimistic Outlook on Overall Situation; Japan Will Be Completely Abandoned by Its Allies</h3>
<p>Germany and the Soviet Union are about to conclude a non-aggression pact. Yesterday, this newspaper's editorial discussed its impact. Now, we translate the comments of the Zi Lin West Daily in this city on this issue for your consideration. Reading it may provide insight into British public opinion. The British are quite calm about this matter, as are the French, as if it were deliberate pretense. However, this is not to be faulted, as when an unexpected blow comes suddenly and a crisis is at hand, the only proper course is to unite, endure pain, and strive to overcome difficulties and turn danger into safety. If, in shock, one creates disturbances or weeps and implores the masses to surrender, it will only dissipate morale, show weakness to the enemy, and provide no benefit to the overall situation. This is what a resolute and courageous nation is unwilling and disdains to do. – Translator</p>
<p>Hitler's obtaining Soviet consent to conclude a non-aggression pact is a significant diplomatic victory, which may have far-reaching implications for the current European situation. However, neither any panic revealed by this, nor the acceptance of a more pessimistic view than before this new development was announced, is justified. The benefits gained by both sides from the agreement are quite clear. At first glance, this move seems to hinder Britain and France, but its final result will certainly not be as harmful to the two countries as initially felt. Because Germany has this agreement, in the event of a European war, the Soviet Union will not be threatened by Germany's activities in the Baltic countries and can maintain its neutrality for a long time. This neutrality can enable Germany to obtain supplies of food and raw materials from neutral countries and give Germany the opportunity to wage a protracted war. From a military point of view, Germany has relieved its concerns about the Soviet Union deploying troops on its eastern front and can deal with the democratic countries of Western Europe with all its strength. From the Soviet Union's point of view, the benefits are equally important. Since Germany is no longer a threat to its western border, it no longer needs to worry about the Far East problem posed by Japan. This invalidates the idea of Japan joining the Rome-Berlin military alliance. This constitutes a severe rejection of Italy's efforts to draw Japan into the alliance. This significantly weakens the strength of the anti-communist bloc. Since one of the most important members of the anti-communist bloc has reconciled with the Soviet Union and signed a non-aggression pact, the position of the remaining two participants is obviously becoming weaker. It is also conceivable that the group of strong nations that Hitler has single-mindedly created may now have sown seeds of division among them in order to meet his own special needs.</p>
<p>In the past, the German military leaders openly insisted on forming an alliance with the Soviet Union, but it did not materialize due to Hitler's own opposition. Now that Hitler has signed this non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, he has made a slight concession to the German military. Although one cannot say that there is any real chance of merging the ideologies of the two countries, a half loaf of non-aggression is better than a military alliance with no bread at all. As for the impact of this significant development on Poland, it is not yet possible to say for sure. However, it should be known that this decision made everything that was always possible before the signing of the military alliance agreement between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union. In the event of a war over the Polish issue, Britain and France will inevitably fight the Axis powers alone. This is always a possibility. Although this non-aggression pact certainly eliminates the possibility of the Soviet Union forming a military alliance with Britain and France, it has not created a military situation that was not previously anticipated. However, Poland's determination to reject Germany's demands may be seen as weaker than before, but this is not necessarily the case. Because the annexation of Danzig into German territory and the occupation of the Polish Corridor by Germany will obviously economically control Poland's fate. If so, then Poland will no longer be an independent country. Judging from the current mood of the Polish people, they may not be willing to accept this change. If they accept it, it is tantamount to national suicide. Therefore, it would not be surprising if we learned in the coming days that Poland's will to resist has not changed. If Poland decides to take this path, Britain and France will certainly come to its aid. If the Axis powers are concerned, although Germany's position may seem better than before in the initial contact, the war situation will eventually improve. This is undoubtedly beyond doubt. If the general result of the German-Soviet agreement is to strengthen Hitler's hand in the present, then the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis must be weakened and destroy any opportunity for Japan to gain benefits by joining the German-Italian military alliance, and it constitutes a severe rejection of Italy's eagerness to form this union. If Japan cannot hope to receive the assistance of Germany, which is bound by a non-aggression pact, in the event of a Soviet-Japanese war, then Japan will never join this alliance. Therefore, the relations between the three countries that formed the anti-communist bloc can be summarized as follows today: Germany has signed a pact with Italy in its military alliance, clearly stating that if a dispute arises between the Soviet Union and Italy, Italy cannot expect the military assistance of the main member of the German-Italian military alliance. Italy initially wanted Japan to join the military alliance, but now it will see that Germany has no intention of inviting Japan to join this alliance to assist its aggression. Japan may have realized that the situation created by the German-Soviet non-aggression pact has placed it in a decidedly disadvantageous position and recognized that the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis has no value in allowing it to join the German-Italian military alliance. Therefore, the general situation today has caused a perplexed change in the minor members of the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo axis. If Germany is indeed using its schemes, disregarding its allies, and even disregarding the impact of this development on them, then everything mentioned above seems very correct in light of the recent events. Germany may turn to persuade Italy to also conclude a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union. This sounds strange at first hearing, but in the past few years, Italy has followed Germany closely. It is certainly conceivable that Italy will follow Germany's example. If so, what will Japan do? It will be completely abandoned by its allies today, just as it was abandoned by the democratic countries. It is in great danger of becoming isolated. Therefore, in this situation, one should not have a pessimistic outlook on the overall situation, because this does not create a new position, and this is not always possible. If Germany is indeed discarding its two allies, as they say, then its final result may prove to further strengthen the power of the democratic countries.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Chao-Shan Invade Jieyang and Suffer a Defeat; Zhou Zhizhen Offers a Plan to Seize Jieyang and Protect Shantou; Japanese Planes Tragically Bomb Xingning and Fengshun</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Japanese troops in Chao-Shan are only able to hold the key points along the Chao-Shan Railway. Villages and townships more than three Chinese miles away from the railway are beyond the reach of Japanese forces. Therefore, even though the Japanese troops have occupied Chaoan for two months, they are showing signs of exhaustion. In Shantou City, a puppet organization initially appeared, called the "Local Maintenance Association," with Chen Juemin as the puppet chairman. However, because Chen could not recruit local people to participate, he simply left the puppet Maintenance Association and called himself the Supervisor of Huichaojia, handing the puppet Maintenance Association over to Yang Jixiang to run, receiving a monthly military ticket allowance from the Japanese army to maintain appearances. In July, the Japanese army again pulled out Wu Sujuan, a nurse from the Boai Hospital, to organize the puppet Chao-Shan Women's Great Alliance. Apart from three or so concubines of the rogues who came to the scene, no women participated. Recently, a person named Zhou Zhizhen arrived in Shantou on a mission to form a puppet Peace and National Salvation Revival Army. The Japanese army greatly appreciated him and immediately instigated Zhou to organize a puppet Shantou City United Committee, and also pulled out Zhang Weichen, Zhong Rongguang, and Yue Junan from Chaoan to be puppet committee members, limiting them to prepare for establishment by the 18th of this month, with Zhang Weichen as the puppet Finance Bureau Chief, Zhong Rongguang as the puppet Police Bureau Chief, and Yue Junan as the puppet General Affairs Bureau Chief. Zhou Zhizhen also offered a plan to the Japanese side, saying that if they wanted to protect Chao-Shan, they must first seize Jieyang, and only by consolidating the outer line strongholds could Chao-Shan be stabilized. The Japanese army believed him, so on the 9th, they transferred 500 puppet vanguard team members from Guangzhou, half of whom were from the Northeast, Taiwan, and Korea. The leader of the team, a certain Li, was from Jiaoling, Guangdong, who had been doing business in Taiwan for many years, forgetting his ancestors and not knowing where his blood came from. Starting on the 10th, the Japanese troops in Chaoan City moved out towards Fengxi, invading Anjie Road, with several squadrons of aircraft as the vanguard, bombing and firing at Meigang, Quxi, Xichang, Guanbu, and Fengshan in Jieyang, causing heavy losses to the people. More than 300 Japanese troops marched to the foothills of Fengling Mountain and were intercepted by the Chinese security team. After four hours of bloody fighting, the Japanese troops were defeated and left. The next day, the Japanese troops again transferred 600 Japanese troops from Fuyang and Guanchao to invade Qingmaoshan and Yuntishan on Anjie Road, with cavalry and tank teams as the vanguard. They were also invited to attack by the Chinese army in the mountains. The tanks fell into traps, blocking the way. The fighting continued until sunset, and the Japanese troops collapsed and retreated, returning to Fuyang and Guanchao. They were also cut off by the Chinese guerrillas from Sangpu Mountain at Wuyang Mountain. The Japanese artillery fired hundreds of shells to cover their retreat. On the 12th, the Japanese troops, in view of the threat to the flanks of the siege of Jieyang from the Chinese army on Sangpu Mountain, again transferred 300 troops from Chaoan, together with Japanese troops from Caitang, Guanchao, and Fuyang, with five cannons and more than ten mortars, to enter the mountains along three routes: Jinshishi, Hongan Township, and Shaxi. The foot of Sangpu Mountain, only thirty Chinese miles from the railway line, its mountains parallel to the railway and straddling Anjie Highway, its mountain range is quite majestic. Although the Japanese troops invaded along three routes, they were still defeated by the Chinese guerrillas on the mountain. In the afternoon, the Japanese troops fled to Yunbu City, where they were exhausted and their formations were already disorganized. In summary, in three days of fighting, the Chinese army was able to use the terrain to fight the few against the many, and the Japanese army suffered more than 500 casualties. At this time, the Chinese regular army was still in the rear of Xingning, Fengshun, and Jieyang, waiting for an opportunity for a general counterattack. Therefore, those who clashed with the Japanese army in the past few days were security regiments, guerrillas, and strong men from various villages who ran up the mountains. Their fighting spirit was strong, so they were able to achieve such results. After suffering this disastrous defeat, the Japanese army sent out four planes on the 13th to bomb Xingning, Fengshun, Liuhuang, Tangkeng, and other places. Xingning was hit by fourteen bombs, eight of which fell within the city, destroying seven of the county middle school dormitories, collapsing the local court, and destroying many nearby civilian houses. Two bombs fell on Shanghua Street outside the city, collapsing six shops. Two bombs fell on Xingxui Station, flattening it. Two bombs fell on the civilian hospital, destroying three civilian houses. At 7:00 AM on the 14th, seven Japanese planes flew again to Xingning and Fengshun to drop bombs, flying low over the suburbs of Xingning for 45 minutes, dropping up to 80 bombs, including 12 incendiary bombs. A large fire broke out throughout the city. The civilian houses in the city were reduced to rubble. The Japanese planes then turned to Fengshun and Liuhuang, dropping 15 bombs. Many local people did not have time to escape and suffered hundreds of casualties. When the Japanese planes passed Tangkeng, they also dropped five bombs and then flew overseas. The Japanese army's failure to attack Jieyang actually used planes to take revenge on the people in the rear, which can be described as extremely cruel.</p>
<h3>Australia in Complete Cooperation with Britain</h3>

<h3>Finance: European War Clouds Loom, Gold Prices Rise and Fall Wildly; Gold Holders Rush to Liquidate, Low Point Sees 3,965 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the after-hours trading of spot gold suddenly plummeted, falling by a significant 570 yuan. The opening this morning was driven by electronic transmissions that the situation in Europe was serious, with a possibility of imminent outbreak. Apart from the Hong Kong merchants who absorbed some, many parties panicked and came out in droves, causing prices to plummet. It fell to as low as 4,100 yuan, and remained listless until noon, closing at 4,150 yuan. The opening in the afternoon was weak, followed by the agitation of gold hoarders outside the industry caused by the publication of newspaper extra news. Fearing that gold would be reduced to cheap goods in the event of World War I, they immediately rushed to the market to dump their holdings, causing the price to break through the 4,000 yuan mark and once retreated to a low of 3,790 yuan. Although a certain gold shop took advantage of the low price to pull up the price, the volume of transactions was sparse, and the closing price was only 3,965 yuan. However, it was reported that the potential was suddenly good after the closing, and it returned to 4,050 yuan. The volume of transactions throughout the day was extremely strong, about two to three thousand taels. Silver shop jewelry gold also fell sharply by 60 yuan. Customs gold remained flat, while Sino-British pure gold and others fell slightly.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Plummets 570 Yuan</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially opened weak. Coupled with the strong foreign exchange, the buyers were cautious. The market opened 35 yuan lower. Silver shops sold twenty taels to money changers, with the price at 4,500 yuan. Suddenly, news came that the German army had been ordered to prepare to advance into Danzig, and it was also rumored that Britain had begun preliminary mobilization. As a result, foreign exchange became looser and people became more anxious. Many sellers competed to close their positions. Although at that time a certain silver shop (on behalf of Hong Kong merchants) came to absorb, the selling positions were several times higher, causing the price to tend to fall. Soon it plummeted by 150 yuan. Gold shops mutually traded 30 taels at a price of 4,350 yuan. Later, foreign exchange slightly recovered, and Hong Kong merchants continued to absorb, so the market once recovered to 4,410 yuan. Later, it was heard that foreign exchange had loosened again, and the selling wind rose again. Money changers and securities firms became more interested in buying. It fell another 100 yuan. Silver shops sold 30 taels to money changers at 4,310 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop came to recover some, and once again recovered to 4,365 yuan. After 11 o'clock, foreign exchange continued to weaken, so sellers on the front became more eager. Money changers and a certain silver shop rushed to sell. Before long, it fell again by 265 yuan. Silver shops sold ten taels to money changers at a price of 4,100 yuan. Near noon, Yuhao mutually traded 30 taels, recovering to 4,150 yuan as the noon closing price. In the afternoon, people became more nervous, buyers were lacking, and money changers and cash shops came to sell, making the market more chaotic. The opening was 30 yuan lower. Money changers sold 30 taels to Linghao at 4,120 yuan. After the opening, retail investors also came out to sell heavily, and securities firms also sold. Before long, it plummeted by 150 yuan. Securities firms sold 20 taels to cash shops at 3,970 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop strongly absorbed more than a hundred taels, once pulling the price up to 4,050 yuan. Afterwards, because non-industry sellers came one after another, and all sold at market price, buyers, in view of such panic, generally watched with their hands tied. Therefore, there was even less maintenance, and it fell again by 260 yuan. Money changers mutually traded ten taels, with a price of 3,790 yuan, which was the low point of the day. After entering, a certain gold shop took advantage of the low price to aggressively enter, and for a time, the sellers looked on indifferently. Although the price rose to the 3,900 yuan mark, buyers did not buy at all. Later, because a certain gold shop continued to buy at the market price, it raised the price by another 95 yuan. A certain gold shop paid the money changers 30 taels at 3,995 yuan. Later, silver shops resumed the selling wind, and the price fell again by 30 yuan. Silver shops sold 30 taels to money changers at 3,965 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, it fell sharply by 570 yuan compared to the previous day. It was reported that a certain money changer outside the market entered 20 taels for the silver shop, with a price of 4,050 yuan. The range throughout the day was 720 yuan. The selling price of cash shops' own brand gold was ten yuan higher than spot gold. The current bid gold was about fifty yuan lower than the listed gold, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Also Falls by 60 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange price of jewelry gold per tael at silver shops was initially 460 yuan at Dahangtong. At 9:35, it was reduced by five yuan. After a moment, it was reduced by another ten yuan. At 10:10, it was reduced by another five yuan. At 11:30, it fell another five yuan. At 11:58, it fell another five yuan. At 12:00, it fell another ten yuan. At 12:10, it returned to five yuan. At 2:15 in the afternoon, it fell another fifteen yuan. At 2:30, it fell another fifteen yuan. At that time, Dahangtong suspended 390 yuan. Later, at 2:45, it returned to five yuan. At 3:15, it returned to another five yuan. As a result, it was reduced by 60 yuan. Dahangtong changed the suspension to 400 yuan, and Xinhangtong was 398 yuan. The purchase price was reduced by about 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Reacts Simultaneously: Bulls Rush to Close Positions, Market Continues to Weaken Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw HSBC's listed rates unchanged. In the unofficial Sterling-Dollar market, the initial situation was relatively calm. However, after 9:30 AM, news suddenly arrived via telegram that German troops were about to occupy Poland and were preparing to advance on Danzig. Furthermore, it was reported that Britain had also initiated preliminary mobilization, bringing the European situation to a critical juncture. Consequently, general operators were panicked. Entities like China Bank and East Asia Bank, along with speculators, rushed to unload their positions. Hong Kong telegrams frequently offered to sell, and foreign banks like HSBC had poor absorption capacity, leading to a severe oversupply of funds. The market weakened significantly. At one point, the strongest Sterling rate reached 3 shillings 7.1875 pence, and the lowest Dollar rate saw foreign banks absorbing at 7.25 yuan. Ultimately, Sterling closed at 3 shillings 6.875 pence and the Dollar at 7.1875 yuan. However, the market briefly improved due to foreign firms settling accounts and foreign banks absorbing positions, causing the exchange rate to soften slightly. Ultimately, the abundance of sellers made it unsustainable. The near-term market weakened similarly to the spot market. For September contracts, the market was firmer than the spot market due to an even greater influx of sellers and foreign banks' willingness to absorb being weak. In the end, Sterling weakened by 25 pence, and the Dollar depreciated by half a yuan. Trading volume was still brisk for half the day.</p>
<p>Dollar Rate Reached 7 Yuan</p>
<p>Early morning rates showed London at 875 points higher for near-term large bars and 9375 points higher for forward contracts. New York silver prices also surged by 1.25 points. London bullion fell by half a penny. In exchange rates, Sterling against Dollar remained unchanged, against Shanghai up 0.0625, against France up 2 centimes. Dollar against Sterling remained level, against Shanghai up 0.04, against France up 0.0625. The Central Bank's listed rates for all currencies remained the same. Banks opened the spot market with a selling price of 3 and a half shillings for Sterling and 6.8125 yuan for the Dollar, both unchanged from the previous close. After opening, the first Hong Kong telegram offered spot Sterling at 3 shillings 5.3125 pence to foreign banks, showing a slightly firmer trend. After HSBC's listed rates were announced as unchanged and the Silver Equalization Tax was revealed to remain waived, news suddenly arrived via telegram that German troops had been ordered to prepare to occupy Poland and would advance on Danzig. Further reports indicated that Britain had also initiated preliminary mobilization. Additionally, China Bank's Hong Kong branch sent in offers to sell, further hardening the market. China Bank, East Asia Bank, and others sold spot Sterling at 3 shillings 6.25 pence and spot Dollars at 6.9375 and 7.0625 yuan to foreign banks like HSBC. At 10:00 AM, the market briefly rallied due to some foreign firms settling accounts and foreign banks' willingness to absorb improving. Foreign firms bought spot Sterling at 3 shillings 5.9375 pence and spot Dollars at 7 yuan from foreign banks. Subsequently, a flood of sell orders came from Hong Kong via telegram, and Chinese merchants rushed to close their positions, causing the situation to weaken again. Hong Kong telegrams sold spot Sterling at 3 shillings 6.25 pence to foreign banks. Following this, Chinese merchants sold September Sterling at 3 shillings 4.0625 pence to a certain bank and offered September Dollars at 6.625 yuan to E Lee Bank. At the time, foreign banks showed no appetite for current month Dollars at 7.125 yuan. Later in the day, banks bought spot Sterling at 3 shillings 6.5625 pence and spot Dollars at 7.125 yuan from foreign banks. Near noon, China Bank sold spot Sterling at 3 shillings 6.875 pence and spot Dollars at 7.1875 yuan to foreign banks. Following this, Chinese merchants sold spot Dollars to a certain bank, hardening the rate to 7.25 yuan. Simultaneously, foreign banks bid for Sterling at 3 shillings 7.1875 pence. At noon closing, the bank's spot selling prices were 3 shillings 6.875 pence for Sterling and 7.1875 yuan for the Dollar. Current month rates were 3 shillings 6.71875 pence for Sterling and 7.15625 yuan for the Dollar. September rates were 3 shillings 4.375 pence for Sterling and 6.6875 yuan for the Dollar. The results showed a weakening of 1875 pence for spot and current month Sterling and a hardening of 375 for the Dollar compared to the previous day. September Sterling weakened by 25 pence, and the Dollar hardened by half a yuan. There was no market on Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Securities: Stimulated by Domestic Bonds, Category A Rushes Past 50 Yuan, Far East Stocks Continue to Fall</h3>
<p>The securities gray market saw trading yesterday stimulated by the increasingly close relations between Germany and the Soviet Union, which visibly altered the global landscape. Public bonds were strongly stimulated by this positive news and rose sharply. Because of the large number of short positions, covering was very active. Rumors started circulating after closing, causing a further rise of about half a yuan, followed by a retreat. Amidst such dramatic changes, the market price will inevitably experience more substantial fluctuations, swinging high and low. Yesterday, the market opened with a sharp rise of about one yuan. Ding Kang, Da Tong, De Fu, Heng Fu, Run Li, and No. 5, No. 42 were all bought, but in limited quantities. Song Mao, Lian Yi, Hong Da, Yong Kang, and others were mostly sold.

<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were traded at a price of 8.4 yuan per share.</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce reported that yesterday's market was quiet, with minor price changes.

<p>Foreign Currencies Plunge Directly: English and American Gold Pounds Fall by 100 Yuan; The First Sharp Drop After a High Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, the European situation was turbulent. The possibility of war between Poland and Germany was imminent. The market was panicked. Foreign exchange weakened, and cash currency plummeted. The foreign currency market saw a sharp decline. English and American gold pounds were offered for sale in abundance, both falling by 100 yuan. The English gold pound fell to 95 yuan, and the American gold pound fell to 97 yuan, the first sharp drop after a surge. English and American gold drafts were supplied smoothly. The American gold draft once fell to 13.4 yuan, demonstrating the extreme panic. Later, money changers took advantage of the low prices to buy, and the decline was halted. Hong Kong drafts and French Francs also saw significant declines. Singapore drafts and Dutch drafts saw little demand, and the market was very weak. The Japanese gold draft was 1.15 yuan in the evening market, and the Korean draft was 99 cents in the evening market, both declining.

Only the German gold draft and Italian draft remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Yarn Bulls Flee in Large Numbers: Double Horse Yarn Plummets 70 Yuan, Others Fall 40-50 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market opened fairly stable, with a slight weakness. Then, with the official announcement of the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany, opinions in the market diverged, and no consensus was reached. It was said to be beneficial to China. As a result, the market fluctuated, and sentiment turned optimistic. Bulls, seeing the changing international situation, became bearish on all commodities. Consequently, large quantities were offered for sale en masse. The supply of chips became abundant. Buyers, seeing the overwhelming trend, had the intention of maintaining support, but the environment was such that they lacked the courage to do so. In fact, successive days of price hikes had been excessive. Although demand from Hong Kong continued, market sources said that transactions involving gains and losses for Guangbang merchants accounted for more than 50%. Therefore, once the reaction suddenly appeared, it was unrecoverable, like a dam breaking. The 20s Double Horse yarn ticket suffered the most drastic drop, falling 70 yuan compared to the previous day. The spot price also fell. The opening price was 750 yuan, but it fell to a closing price of 700 yuan, driven by negative news, a sharp drop of 64 yuan compared to the previous day. Other yarns also fell by 40-50 yuan. This situation made everyone pale in fear. Half-day transaction statistics totaled 855 bales. A breakdown of the quantities purchased by each trade group is listed below:</p>
<p>Afternoon news reported a conflict between Germany and Poland. Gold prices plummeted, and sentiment became even more fearful. Sellers were eager to sell, while buyers shrank back in fear and dared not try.</p>
<h3>Yarn Prices Plummet, Cotton Mills Turn Quiet; However, Raw Cotton is a Wartime Necessity: All Parties Firmly Believe Prices Will Only Rise, Not Fall</h3>
<p>Transactions in raw cotton were scarce. Chinese cotton completely entered a standstill. Only Indian cotton saw some transactions, but in very small quantities, and all transactions were agreed upon in the morning. The international situation changed, and yarn prices plummeted by a massive 60-70 yuan. As a result, raw cotton, which is interdependent with yarn, was inevitably drawn into the vortex. According to market sources, cotton prices rose by more than 10 yuan per picul compared to the previous day. Mills, seeing the severity of the situation, had no intention of procuring. Deliveries of Subu cotton bales had not arrived. A record of sales conditions is listed below:</p>
<p>Another dispatch reported that trade in foreign cotton in Shanghai was very beneficial to China's war of resistance because of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, which caused extraordinary excitement. However, speculators closed positions to take profits on the belief that the future European situation would not allow pure gold to be reported, resulting in a longer exchange rate for US dollars that once reached 7.25 yuan. Everyone believed that this was only a temporary result of market fluctuations, and that a conversion of raw cotton prices could reduce 45 yuan per dan. Colleagues are convinced that the long exchange rate is a temporary floating settlement. In the future, if the European war becomes the development phase, then China's overseas transport, all countries have no time to take into account, then Sino-foreign transport will be interrupted. Moreover, raw cotton is a wartime necessity, so all parties are confident that the price of cotton will only rise, not fall. The market has been spreading the news that the Customs Gold conversion rate will change, which is beneficial to the rise in cotton prices.</p>
<p>The foreign cotton market has been quiet for many days in New York, but yesterday, due to the news of the tense European situation, the cotton market was very active. Colleagues are strongly buying in the market. Raw cotton is a military raw material, and due to the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the European political situation has taken a sharp turn for the worse, and all countries are making extraordinary preparations, so overseas cotton merchants are purchasing American cotton very enthusiastically, so the closing price rose by more than ten pounds compared to the previous day. India, because of its slightly different situation, is expected to rise by another 2 rupees and a half, and Egypt is expected to rise by more than ten pounds.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rice Unchanged, Shops Actively Transact, Afternoon Improves, Over 2,000 More Bales of New Hsien Arrive</h3>
<p>Du Geng: Over 2,000 bales of cartwheel-wrapped rice arrived. After the overall market rebounded briefly yesterday, the opening hand was weaker yesterday, and the market declined. However, by noon, with sparse arrivals, shops on the street suddenly became active, and the market rose again in an instant, resulting in a fixed situation. Gao Xi Geng opened at 39 yuan, fresh Changzhou Geng at 39 yuan, Kunshan Su and Tong trades at 37.6 to 38 yuan, Hexia early and late rice at 34 to 35 yuan, original wrapped rice at 37 to 38 yuan, Gao Chen Tip at 35 to 36 yuan, new Tip at 33 to 34 yuan, Bian Yuan at 30 to 31 yuan. The total transaction volume was just over 7,000 bales.</p>
<p>Ke Hsien: Yesterday morning, due to the arrival of new Hsien from all routes, the market seemed to be leveling off. Then, shops and storage facilities took advantage of small-scale absorption, and the market tightened again. As a result, it was still larger than the previous market by about half a yuan. Chen Hsien from Wuhu still required 35 or 6 yuan, new Hsien at 32.5 yuan, newly arrived Taizhou new Hsien opened at 34 yuan, and Jiangbei new Hsien at 35 yuan. Over 2,000 bales of new Hsien from all routes arrived.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: No bulk deals were finalized. Sellers remained opportunistic. New Saigon initially opened at 43 yuan, then increased by 2 yuan to 45 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Sales Broaden Daily, Wheat Prices Loosen</h3>
<p>Flour: Sales of existing flour have been increasing daily since rice prices soared. Yesterday, rice shops that also retailed flour were asking factories to supply as much as possible. In order to maintain the food supply, factories did not limit supply, but required direct delivery to prevent hoarding and profiteering. Total market transactions increased sharply to over 40,000 bales. The No. 2 flour factory traded at 6.4 yuan in cash. Returns of goods became increasingly chaotic, and selling prices rose to 6.67 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat: The wheat market had slightly rebounded yesterday, as the sudden financial upheaval caused general hoarders to become stagnant, dulling the market. Prices gradually loosened. In total, the Fu and Fu factories handled over 10,000 bales. Prices showed little change. Hoarders only took in one cartload of Taicang wheat, at a price of 9.95 yuan.</p>
<h3>Oil Market, Gold Prices Fall: Soybean Oil Plummets Sharply, Down 5-6 Yuan From Highest Price</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the oil market saw a value for the value of the legal tender with an international situation, coupled with the tension in Europe, and prices plummeting, the people's hearts standing still. Speculators were dealt a blow, and hoarders tried to flee, resulting in a sharp drop in the afternoon, plunging 5 or 6 yuan from the highest price of the day. A total of 100 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were traded, with prices opening at 58 yuan, then falling frequently to 54 yuan. Also, 300 barrels of Kobe-Dalian oil arrived, with prices plunging straight from 59 yuan to 55 yuan, along with 50 barrels of Qingdao barrel oil at prices ranging from 56.5 yuan to 54 yuan.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Hoarders Desperately Unload: Cloth Market Cannot Withstand the Pressure</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>The European situation is turbulent, and the hearts of the people in this city are uneasy. A portion of the hoarders are eager to sell, and the market suddenly loosens. Da Peng Fugui paper cloth falls 25 cents per piece. The remaining fine cloth and fine twill also fall 30 cents. Light and heavy coarse cloth falls 10 to 20 cents. Bleached and dyed cloth and woolen fabrics fall 30 to 50 cents per piece. Market prices vary. However, factories and colleagues mostly maintain their original positions. Sales on the street drop sharply, and customer sales also decrease. Singapore, Siam, and Bengal, among other foreign locations, handle 3,000 pieces of bleached cloth, printed poplin, and dyed drill. The Sichuan and Yunnan trades handle over 3,000 pieces of dyed cloth, printed satin, pongee, and mousseline. The Ningbo trade handles 60 packages of Yihe and Dasheng coarse cloth. The Shandong trade handles over 40 packages of New Yu 16-pound Earth brand coarse cloth.</p>
<p>East Piece</p>
<p>The market atmosphere is weak, and white and colored goods alike are falling. White fine cloth plummets 30 to 75 cents per piece. 12-pound Five Blessings fine cloth falls from 16.75 yuan to 16 yuan. The decline in fine twill is slower, falling 10 to 20 cents per piece. Dong cotton stores take in over one hundred packages of Longtou fine cloth spot goods, with a settlement price of 18 yuan per piece. However, there are only a few customer transactions. The street market is also only sparsely decorated, and the trend is particularly stagnant.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>23rd of this month: 30 pieces shipped to Xiamen, 20 pieces to Hong Kong, 42 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 2 pieces to Haikou.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Slab Blue Soars</h3>
<p>With market stocks dwindling, domestic sugar is frequently rising. Yesterday's listed prices continued to rise. Shantou cotton white and above ice opened at 54 yuan, numbering dozens of packages. Huanggang green 96 packages reached 40 yuan. Over one hundred pieces of Jizhuang slab blue opened at 32 yuan, an unprecedented high price. Newly arrived white package Hainan red lined goods cleared 31 yuan, and oil package goods opened at 26 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Shanghai Silk Drops Sharply</h3>
<p>Yesterday's silk market saw a sharp drop due to the extended exchange rate. White factory grade 7/8 sold for 3925 yuan, a drop of about 80 yuan. Foreign firms' buying prices had already fallen within the 3800 yuan range, so the silk market in recent days may encounter setbacks.</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign silk markets saw a slight rebound. New York spot prices rose by 2.5 cents, and forward contracts rose by 2.5 cents. Yokohama spot prices rose by 5 yuan, and forward contracts rose by 8 yuan. However, these gains did not provide any support to the Shanghai silk market due to foreign exchange fluctuations.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Kylin Vegetables Stock Will Soon be Depleted</h3>
<p>The stock of kylin vegetables here is thin. Having been sold off successively, it is about to be depleted. And new supply cannot keep up. The market has risen by more than ten yuan. Lion's mane vegetables sell for 40 yuan, while Ceylon and dragon teeth sell for 38 yuan.</p>
<h3>Metals: Selling Prices Chaotic</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, reliable sources reported that German troops would invade the Polish Corridor before noon today, causing the European situation to suddenly become tense. The Shanghai market also changed accordingly. The market was chaotic for a time, and the five metal products were greatly affected. Opening prices fluctuated sharply, with no standard price to speak of. An excerpt of the public meeting price and colleagues' selling plates are reproduced below for reference as needed.</p>

<h3>After International Situation Changes, Chinese Finance Becomes More Advantageous; Japanese Finance Suffers Considerable Impact; The Future of Eurasian Commerce Will Change</h3>
<p>Since foreign dispatches reported the signing of a business credit agreement between the Soviet Union and Germany, followed by news that the German Foreign Minister would fly to the Soviet Union to negotiate the conclusion of a Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the international situation suddenly changed. Domestic and foreign financial, economic, and market conditions were stimulated by this news, and sentiment was shaken. Chinese financial circles generally predict that the Soviet Union's future policy towards the Far East will become more active, so the basis of legal tender will inevitably become more solid, and foreign exchange will become more stable. Japanese currency, due to the extent of the impact on the anti-communist agreement within the country, is viewed with suspicion and its labor will be weaker. The impact on the future of commercial finance in the Far East is significant. Here is a record of public sentiment:</p>
<p>Beneficial to China: Early Signs</p>
<p>According to the observations of financial figures familiar with the international situation, given the current state of the European situation, Britain and France are deeply concerned about the Danzig problem. To contain the issue, they hesitate. At this time, Soviet-German relations suddenly undergo a change. Apart from observing developments, Britain and France, due to their still relatively good relationship with the Soviet Union, though suffering an unexpected setback, are unlikely to see any weakening in their position and national power. However, the general Shanghai market believes that Germany, after signing an agreement, will attempt to seize Danzig, and the future of Europe is unpredictable. Therefore, they believe that the source of German goods may not be as smooth as before, and they generally hold a view of calm observation, in order to sell at a good price. However, this observation is not shared by those in the know. Observers believe that Germany may still use the momentum of signing an agreement as a method of seeking to seize Danzig. As for the Soviet Union, it can at least obtain the opportunity to freely deal with the Far East. Therefore, their view is that the impact on Europe is not as close and immediate as the impact on the Far East. In general, the news of this being beneficial to the Chinese economy and finance can be said to be a direct and good result.</p>
<p>Japanese Finance: Considerable Impact</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, regarding the recent changes in Soviet-German relations, there is outward calm, but market sentiment is becoming troubled. Yesterday, financial figures received news that the prices of various Japanese stocks are weakening. The exchange rate between the Japanese yen and legal tender in China continued to decline yesterday (at 1.18 yuan). Japan's trade with the Soviet Union, which was already minuscule, will be further impacted by the signing of this Soviet-German business agreement. Japan's trade with Germany will also be affected by the impact of Soviet goods entering Germany. In addition, the US-Japan trade agreement and the US announcement of the termination date means that Japan's commercial and economic situation will enter an even more difficult situation. It is generally predicted that Japan's finance will be subject to considerable impact.</p>
<p>Shanghai Finance: Generally Improved</p>
<p>Due to the signing of the Soviet-German non-aggression pact, the Shanghai financial market has generally improved, resulting in the black market foreign exchange continuing to weaken, the black market gold price plummeting, and the securities gray market and unified bonds soaring. However, China's legal tender is now becoming more stable. Although the amount of legal tender issued has increased compared to before the war, cash reserves are above 40%, ranking first among cash reserves in European and American countries. After foreign exchange has been stabilized by the Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee, the central bank's official exchange rate has always been stable, and legitimate needs for all industries are still being supplied as much as possible.</p>
<p>Gold Plummets: Public Bonds Soar</p>
<p>Yesterday, a New Voice News Agency reporter learned the following from the financial market: (1) The black market foreign exchange, as listed by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, remained unchanged. However, the actual market rates weakened, with English exchange at 3 shillings 65/100 points and the US exchange at 7 yuan. (2) The black market for gold plummeted yesterday morning, with the morning market at 4,150 yuan and the afternoon closing at 3,965 yuan. (3) The securities gray market soared yesterday morning, with Category A unified closing at 50 yuan and 30 cents, up 1.5 yuan; Category B closing at 44 yuan and 20 cents, up 1.05 yuan; Category C closing at 41 yuan and 90 cents, up 1.35 yuan; Category D closing at 40 yuan and 8 cents, up 1.3 yuan; and Category E closing at 41 yuan and 45 cents, up 1.4 yuan. (4) Discount on remittances yesterday morning was 185 yuan, down 10 yuan from the previous day.</p>
<h3>The False "City Government" Attempts to Take Over the Court; The Municipal Council Has Refused; The Court is Based on an Agreement Signed by Various Countries; Any Issues Should Be Discussed with the Respective Countries</h3>
<p>Chuan Xiao'an, the "Mayor of Shanghai," has long desired to interfere with the First and Second District Courts of the International Settlement and has repeatedly decided to request the Public Concession authorities and the French Consul General in Shanghai to "take over." It is now learned that Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, has responded based on the provisions of the First Special District Court Agreement, stating that any issues related to the First Special District Court should be discussed with the signatory countries. The general meaning of the Municipal Council's reply is approximately as follows: "Your Municipal Government's letter of August 12, 1939, has been received by this Council. Upon investigation, the First Special District Court is established by an agreement signed by representatives of the Chinese government and the governments of Brazil, the United States, the United Kingdom, Norway, the Netherlands, and France. This Council is not a signatory to this agreement. Therefore, any issues related to the First Special District Court should be addressed to the respective signatory countries."</p>
<h3>Guerrilla Forces in the Suburbs of Shanghai; The Japanese Claim There are 5,000; A Train of Japanese Soldiers Derailed in the Changzhou Incident; Jinshanwei Wanmen Was Once Recaptured</h3>
<p>The French-language Shanghai Daily reported on the 23rd that a pedestrian had encountered more than 50 guerrillas in the Hongqiao area the previous week. On the previous Sunday, the Japanese garrison in Shanghai dispatched more than a dozen tanks to the Qingpu area. According to a declaration by the Japanese authorities yesterday, there are currently over 5,000 guerrillas in the vicinity of Shanghai. The Japanese army is about to begin "suppression." Yesterday, it was heard that some villagers transporting rice to Shanghai for self-sufficiency had been intercepted by guerrillas. Due to the difficulty of inland transportation, villagers mostly transported it in batches of two dan by bicycle to Shanghai. Since yesterday morning, the long lines of rice-carrying bicycles that were commonly seen on Hongqiao Road have suddenly disappeared. For this reason, it is becoming increasingly impossible for inland rice to come to Shanghai. Regarding the interruption of the Shanghai-Nanjing railway, it is said that it was also caused by the activities of guerrillas. According to a passenger who came to Shanghai, the incident occurred in Changzhou. After the tracks were destroyed, a train of soldiers derailed, with as many as eight carriages destroyed. Therefore, those who left Nanjing on Sunday (the 21st) had to wait until noon yesterday (the 22nd) to reach Shanghai. Furthermore, according to people from Jiaxing, Chinese guerrilla forces have been extremely active along the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway in the past week. Every night, Japanese military trains constantly travel along the road, extremely busy.</p>
<p>Only about 300 Japanese soldiers are stationed in Jiaxing city. Therefore, the city gates are tightly closed at night, and they dare not step beyond the boundaries. It is reported that the regular Chinese troops who have been crossing the Qiantang River from the south bank in recent days are now advancing towards the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway area. Fierce battles broke out in the Jinshanwei area on the night of the 20th. A part of the Chinese army besieged the west gate of Jinshanwei, while the main force fiercely attacked the east gate and recaptured Wanmen. The Japanese army was unable to resist and retreated to the west gate. The Chinese side achieved great results in this battle.</p>
<h3>Promoting National Construction Savings; Banks and Post Offices Begin Accepting Deposits; Various Regions Ordered to Actively Promote the Program</h3>
<p>A telegram from the Central Social Department states: "The promotion of thrifty National Construction Savings is one of the social movements promoted by party departments in various regions. This Department has repeatedly sent documents to party departments in various regions to report on the progress of the program. Many have already submitted special reports, but many have not reported the actual progress of the program to this Department. This Department has repeatedly written to the Ministry of Finance requesting that it instruct banks in various regions to accept savings, and has also requested that the Ministry of Communications instruct postal savings bureaus in various regions to do the same. We have now received a reply dated June 10 stating that various banks and bureaus can begin accepting deposits in the near future, etc. Therefore, there should be no obstacles to this program. We hope that you will make every effort to promote it actively. The more savings accounts and the larger the amount of savings, the more it will demonstrate the virtues of thrift and patriotism of our people, which is of great importance. You must report the latest progress to this Department for record as soon as possible."</p>
<h3>The Wusong to Qiujiang Wharf Section Was Closed This Morning; It is Said to Be Due to the Handling of Explosives; Japanese Warships Are Now Gathering at the Mouth of the Song River</h3>
<p>According to a notice from the Japanese side, the navigation of ships from Wusong to the Qiujiang Wharf was suspended for one hour from 9:30 AM to 10:30 AM yesterday. According to reports, this was due to the handling of explosives in that area. It is also reported that a large number of Japanese warships and three cruisers are currently gathering in the Huangpu River.</p>
<h3>Hurricanes Continue in Guam; There is Also a High Tide</h3>
<p>The weather in this port has been extremely sultry recently, and the situation of sleeping outdoors in the alleys has not changed. Furthermore, it has been found that there will be another high tide in the Huangpu River from the 29th of this month, with levels between ten and twelve feet. At that time, low-lying roads will still be flooded. A hurricane has also arisen near Guam in the Pacific Ocean and is now moving northwest-west. The area around Luzon Island has already been affected by the wind and is experiencing low pressure. It is difficult to predict whether this port will be threatened, as it is still far from Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Post Office Finds it Difficult to Redeem Token Postage Stamps at Face Value; The Post Office Did Not Initially Approve or Disapprove of Token Postage Stamps; The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits a Petition to the Executive Yuan to Discuss Redemption Methods</h3>
<p>Regarding the handling of the problem of postage stamps temporarily used as small change in this city, after the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Postal Administration, it has now received a reply from the Administration stating that it is difficult to redeem these postage stamps for cash. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Communications to seek solutions to avoid burdening the toiling masses. Various sectors are eagerly awaiting the issuance of small denomination banknotes. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Redemption at Face Value is Difficult</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a letter from the Shanghai Postal Administration yesterday, stating: "Your letter regarding the handling of the two methods for dealing with the postage stamps temporarily used as small change in this city has been received. After careful consideration by this Administration, we hereby reply in separate articles as follows: (1) Because various places in the interior often pay for goods with postage stamps to various bookstores and small shops in this port, the majority of these postage stamps used as tokens are not purchased from this Administration, but are purchased cheaply from these bookstores and small shops. (2) As far as this Administration knows, many of these postage stamps have been used and washed. This Administration, in accordance with postal regulations, may sue those who engage in the crime of washing postage stamps and prosecute them according to criminal law. Most of these washed postage stamps are in the hands of vendors. (3) According to Article 135 of the Postal Regulations, except for holding postage stamps that have been officially abolished, which may be exchanged for new stamps at postal offices within a prescribed period, all kinds of postage stamps, once sold, will not be redeemed by the post office at face value, nor may they be exchanged for other kinds of items. (4) The Post Office neither approves nor disapproves of postage stamps being used as subsidiary currency. However, what should be noted is that postage stamps are not used as subsidiary currency. (5) According to the current situation, if these small-value postage stamps are not too dirty and have not been washed after use, the Post Office can accept them for payment of postage. (6) It is difficult to redeem these postage stamps for cash. In short, this Administration is happy to carefully review all conditions and provide as much assistance as possible within its capabilities. In addition to instructing the staff of this Administration to comply, this letter is sent in response for your information."</p>
<p>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Submits a Petition to the Executive Yuan for Remediation</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Communications in Chongqing yesterday, stating: "Since the disappearance of copper subsidiary currency and old copper cash in Shanghai, there has been a lack of small change in the market, causing disturbances. At that time, opinions were divided, with some advocating that stores issue small change coupons or token coupons themselves. Given the complex situation in this city, with numerous stores, if each store issued its own coupons, there would inevitably be thousands of varieties of disguised subsidiary currency coupons in the market, the obstruction of the national currency system of which goes without saying. Fortunately, some in various sectors advocated the use of postage stamps as substitutes. This theory was unanimously agreed upon, both respecting the national system and resolving the disturbances. At a time when government orders could not reach everywhere, such reasonable actions by the people should be praised by the state. However, postage stamps used as small change pass through many hands and are inevitably soiled. If stored in large quantities, they cannot be exchanged for one or five yuan legal tender like subsidiary currency coupons. The uses are narrow, and the stores and vendors engaged in small transactions, as well as the rickshaw pullers and workers with small incomes, receive more and find it difficult to dispose of them. For stores and vendors, they cannot be used as funds for purchasing goods. Therefore, after the stock is sold out, the accumulation of a large number of postage stamps will cause the funds to be stranded and unable to continue operations. For rickshaw pullers and workers, whose income is calculated on a daily basis, the postage stamps they earn in a day often cannot be disposed of for several days, remaining idle at home, which is tantamount to reducing their income. At a time when prices in this city have reached the highest record since the opening of the port, they directly feel double the pressure. The tragic situation is beyond ordinary imagination. Recently, the Central Bank's one-cent and five-cent subsidiary banknotes are about to be issued. How to deal with these accumulated postage stamps has become an urgent problem to be solved. In addition to 'small-value postage stamps that are not too soiled' being allowed to be used to pay postage according to the Shanghai Postal Administration's reply No. 2617, which was approved by the affiliated association, which can eliminate a part of them, those in the hands of small vendors or rickshaw pullers and workers, given the living conditions of these people, would definitely not have many letters to send in a year to offset postage. Long-term stagnation will turn them into waste. When the toiling masses cannot plan for the next day, how can they bear this loss? The central government has compassion for the people's suffering and does not neglect those in distant places. For the toiling masses who have been burdened to maintain the national currency system, we should plan a solution to remedy the situation. We propose that a redemption method be negotiated, a responsible institution be designated, and orders be telegraphed for implementation, without any expectation of waiting for orders. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows, yàng."</p>
<p>Various Sectors Eagerly Await the Prompt Issuance of Small Denomination Banknotes</p>
<p>Since the Central Bank's small denomination banknotes were temporarily postponed for issuance, there is no definite date for their official issuance. However, there are still cases of refusing to use postage stamps in the market, resulting in repeated disputes and increased difficulties. Although some cigarette shops have recently suddenly taken out the copper coins that were previously hidden, the number is limited after all, and there are many difficulties in finding change. The token coupons prepared by various stores for redemption are still being used in the market because the issuance of small denomination banknotes has been postponed, and they are welcomed by the citizens. Small stores and vendors see token coupons as being less prone to soiling and rejection than postage stamps. In recent days, disputes over refusing to use postage stamps in vegetable markets and on public transportation have been almost constant. All sectors are eagerly hoping that small denomination banknotes can be issued as soon as possible to facilitate turnover and alleviate commercial difficulties.</p>
<h3>The False Police Publicly Patrol in Teams on Roads Outside the Settlement; A Japanese Military Spokesman Made This Report; But the Police Deny It</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that a Japanese military spokesman claimed at a press conference yesterday (the 22nd) that another incident occurred yesterday between a patrol team of the Public Concession Police and a team of "Great Way Police," involving three British and three Chinese officers from the Police Department, as well as seventeen "Great Way" policemen. The incident occurred when "the Municipal Government police team was proceeding along Route Dufour, near the location of the incident involving Probationary Western Detective Sergeant Kinlock on Saturday, and was stopped by Armored Car No. 1 manned by three Britons and three Chinese. One of the Britons told 'Municipal Government' police Captain Yao that the police force belonged to a part of the Public Concession and that the 'Municipal Government' team had no right to use it. Yao replied that the road did not belong to the Municipal Council and that they were acting on orders from their superiors. If the Public Concession police had any objections, they could negotiate the matter with their superiors." The spokesman continued, "Although the Public Concession police took a threatening attitude and even prepared machine guns, the 'Municipal Government' police did not encounter further disputes and passed through." The spokesman replied to inquiries that if the incident on Saturday could not be blamed on the "Municipal Government" police, they would continue to perform their routine duties. According to the "Municipal Government's" view, its police have the right to patrol on roads outside the settlement. Last night, the Jing'an Temple Police claimed that they were aware of this incident, which was fabricated at the Japanese press conference, but they denied that it had occurred.</p>
<h3>The Glass Manufacturing Industry is in Poor Condition; Maintaining the Livelihood of Workers; Continuing to Work with Painful Endurance</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Glass Manufacturing Industry Association held its 17th joint meeting of directors and supervisors the day before yesterday (the 22nd). In addition to discussing the proposals, the speeches of the attendees revealed the increasing prices of raw materials used in the industry and the difficulties of maintaining the livelihood of workers, and the extremely distressed situation of the industry. A summary is described as follows: (1) The consumption of fuel is extremely high in the glass manufacturing process. The price of fuel, which used to be 15 or 16 yuan per ton, is now about 90 yuan. The price of diesel, which used to be 45 yuan per ton, is now 220 yuan. The price of raw materials, such as pure alkali, which used to be more than one yuan per bag, is now 28 yuan. The price of white sand, which used to be 15 yuan per ton, is now also 28 yuan. The price of sodium nitrate, which used to be 23 yuan per bag, is now 70 yuan. The prices of other miscellaneous raw materials have increased by several percent to one or two times. Among them, fluorite, the main raw material for manufacturing milky white glassware, has increased from more than 20 yuan per ton to about 300 yuan due to the ban on exports from the place of origin, and there is a market without goods. (2) Furthermore, it was said that if the stock of raw materials in the factories of the same industry is sufficient, it is still difficult to maintain costs even if the price of their products increases. It would be better to stop work and sell the raw materials, which can still guarantee a stable profit. However, there are no fewer than 3,000 workers in all the glass factories in this city. If they lose their jobs and their families lose their livelihood, how can they bear it? Therefore, they continue to work with painful endurance. Most of the workers in the glass factory are provided with food and lodging by the factory. Amidst the continuous rise in rice prices, the factory is feeling increasingly overwhelmed. In conclusion, the industry believes that because of years of interaction with customers, it strives to maintain the principle of low prices and high quality for its products and hopes that customers can understand this.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Leaving Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Japanese naval cruisers Yakumo and Iwate arrived in Shanghai on the morning of the 20th of this month. The Iwate was moored at buoys No. 1 and 2 on the Lujiazui waterfront (formerly Italian naval buoys), and the Yakumo was moored at the Mitsubishi Wharf north of the Garden Bridge (the former location of the Izumo). The style of the two ships is the same as that of the Izumo. It is reported that the two ships left Shanghai in the morning and afternoon of yesterday, and their destination is unknown.</p>
<h3>Discussing the Western Shanghai Incident; The Japanese Continue to Hold Special Meetings; Scheduled to Discuss Tomorrow on the Izumo; The Japanese Army and Navy肆意Arbitrarily Criticize the Settlement</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the "Great Way Police" shooting the Western Detective Sergeant Kinlock of the Municipal Council Police Department on Route Dufour on the afternoon of the 19th, the Japanese Consul General and the Army and Navy authorities held a meeting on the "Izumo" at 1:00 PM the day after the incident (the 20th) to discuss countermeasures. It is now learned that the commander of the Japanese Central China Army has scheduled to continue discussions with the Shanghai garrison authorities at 5:00 PM on the 25th of this month based on the conclusions of the discussions on the "Izumo" on the 20th. It is said that those attending at that time will be Major General Suzuki, Colonel Kōhei, and Colonel Tanihagi from the Central China Army side, and Major General Sakurai, Major General Takeshita, and Colonel Mabuchi, the garrison commander in Shanghai, from the Japanese garrison side. It is also stipulated that a special meeting will continue to be held at 8:00 PM that afternoon. According to foreign reports, the commander of the Japanese Central China Army arrived in Shanghai yesterday.</p>
<p>Joint Proclamation by the Japanese Army and Navy</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that the Japanese Army and Navy authorities issued a joint proclamation last night (the 22nd), stating that the Japanese army had issued a joint proclamation some time ago, which was distributed both domestically and abroad, announcing support for the "Reformed Government" and allowing it to be the "Shanghai Special City Government" and to cooperate with it. However, incidents against the "Shanghai City Government" police have occurred on public roads. This is evidence that the British, who control the Municipal Council, do not recognize the reality. Today, the Japanese army has occupied the areas around Shanghai, and the Public Concession authorities should eliminate those who disturb peace and order in the Public Concession and cooperate with the Japanese army in all aspects. Therefore, the existing Chinese government agencies in the Public Concession should be managed by the Japanese army and the government led by the Japanese army. Regarding the above-mentioned unfortunate incident, from the Japanese army's point of view, it is very serious. The Japanese army is determined to take effective and appropriate measures to eliminate the root cause of this incident.</p>
<p>The Settlement Strengthens Western Shanghai's Defense</p>
<p>Since the incident in which the false police shot the Western patrol officer across the border in Caojiadu, Western Shanghai, the Public Concession Police Department and the Gordon Road, Pruth Road, and Jing'an Temple police stations have strengthened their defenses in Western Shanghai and are working hard to conduct searches along the way. Italian and American defense forces are dispatched to assist at any time. Yesterday, there were rumors outside that the Zhaofeng Park had been prevented by the Public Concession authorities from allowing tourists to enter, etc. The reporter of Daguan News Agency inquired about this matter at the park and learned that it was purely untrue. Because there had been a murder case in the park a few days ago, and the situation in the cross-border section has become serious recently, the police authorities have dispatched more detectives to strengthen their defenses in the nearby area and increased the number of gatekeepers, but the number of tourists has not decreased as a result.</p>
<h3>Mr. Yu Qiaqing's Suggestion: Group Order of Foreign Rice to Oversupply the Market and Lower Rice Prices, Then Keep the Cheap Rice for the Poor to Eat; Negotiations for Transporting Rice May Be Resolved Soon</h3>
<p>Important responsible personnel of various Shanghai groups, at 2 PM yesterday, met to discuss ways to maintain the food supply in Shanghai. They decided to order a large quantity of foreign rice to be shipped to Shanghai for relief. Companies, factories, shops, and firms, if they need to order rice, should first register with the group. Detailed measures will be announced after a decision is made. Mr. Yu Qiaqing is working hard to raise funds for the advance payment for the foreign rice order, and is in contact with various banks to provide advance payment. It is said that an agreement in principle has been reached with the banking community, and specific details are under negotiation.</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's Suggestion: Order Foreign Rice</p>
<p>Mr. Yu's suggestion to various important groups stated: "The recent surge in rice prices is unprecedented in history. People in the city are running around warning that rice prices have reached 40 yuan. People are panicked and cannot live in peace. Is it because of a poor harvest and crop failure? No. Is it because someone is hoarding and speculating? It seems so, but it is not. Where is the reason? Simply put, it is due to the time between harvests, insufficient reserves, obstructed transportation, and scarce sources. Judging from the current situation and anticipating the future, rice prices of 50 or 60 yuan are also expected. If we do not quickly develop good strategies, the consequences will be unimaginable. The weak will starve to death, the strong will resort to desperate measures, and bandits will rise up like swarms of bees, covering the land. How can the wealthy protect themselves? What is the solution? Temporarily order foreign rice and sell it at cost for relief. What else can we do? However, in this time of drastic foreign exchange contraction, ordering foreign rice is like drinking poison to quench thirst. Is this not unwise? No, the surge in rice prices is entirely caused by blocked sources and insufficient supply. Recent reports indicate signs of rice-grabbing riots. If we do not quickly develop solutions, how can the security of this city be maintained? Because the matter concerns the people's food supply, there is no time to delay. We should not dwell on these minor details. Some may say, 'Once foreign rice floods in, domestic rice will also come in from various sources. How will we compensate for the losses from setting rice prices?' This is a valid concern. However, when sources flood in, rice prices will inevitably fall. People will be relieved and grateful beyond words. Why talk about compensation? Moreover, there is a good plan to save both others and ourselves, but it requires the unified cooperation of all sectors. Sacrifice the small self to protect the larger self. People from all walks of life should be willing to help. What is the plan? We propose that all sectors (taking each family as a unit) entrust the organization to order a certain number of bags of foreign rice in the shortest possible time, paying a deposit of a certain amount per bag in foreign currency. Once a certain number is reached, a telegram will be sent to order the rice (at market price). We plan to start with various trade associations. Each factory or store should order several months' worth of rice as soon as possible. (The method is to first register with the respective trade associations, and then report the total number to the organization to order.) This will ensure their own supply for the time being, and with sufficient reserves, they will not have to rely on others. Even if rice comes in, few will be interested. According to economic principles, with supply exceeding demand, market prices will inevitably fall. This low-priced rice can be reserved for the poor to eat, providing relief in practice, even if not in name. The factories and stores will not suffer any losses, and the common people will benefit greatly. Here are a few draft articles for reference."</p>
<p>Organize a People's Food Maintenance Association</p>
<p>The draft articles of association for the Shanghai People's Food Maintenance Association are as follows: 1. The sole purpose of this association is to maintain the food supply of Shanghai citizens, not to make a profit. Therefore, it is named the Shanghai People's Food Maintenance Association. 2. This association is initiated by the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the banking and money industry, and the rice industry associations, and is organized by gathering various groups, industry associations, and local gentry. A certain number of committee members will be appointed to be responsible for managing the association's affairs. 3. The association will first raise funds to cover all losses from subsidizing the purchase of rice, and will contact the banking and money industry to negotiate loans to purchase rice, so as to order the rice as soon as possible. 4. The association will order foreign rice from abroad in an open manner to demonstrate fairness and credibility. 5. The association will order rice from foreign firms or producing areas at any time, depending on the supply and demand of rice in the Shanghai market and the amount needed. 6. Regarding the transportation of foreign rice, we will request foreign shipping companies to give preferential treatment. 7. The payment for the rice purchased by the association will be temporarily paid by the banking and money industry. After the goods arrive, they will be stored in warehouses designated by the banking and money industry as security. We will negotiate for lower interest rates on the loans. 8. Rice merchants who entrust the association to purchase rice on their behalf will be charged a certain amount per bag for rescue fees to make up for the lack of rescue funds. No fees will be charged to non-rice merchants. Those who directly order from foreign firms can do so at their convenience. 9. Various industries, guilds, factories, etc. may entrust the association to order rice on their behalf, regardless of the quantity. The association will accept all orders and charge a deposit of a certain amount of silver per bag in advance, without any interest. The goods must be cleared upon arrival without delay. 10. For rice entrusted to the association for purchase, if the market price falls and the goods are delayed in being shipped, the deposit will be confiscated. If there is a shortfall, it should be compensated, and the guarantor will be jointly and severally liable for repayment. 11. Various industries that need rice may entrust their respective industry associations to entrust the association to purchase rice on their behalf. The industry association will be responsible. Those who do not belong to an association should find their own reliable guarantor. 12. The rice purchased by the association on behalf of others must be ordered in batches according to the quantity entrusted. Upon arrival of the goods, the entrusting parties will be notified to pay for and ship the goods. 13. Separate detailed rules will be formulated for various administrative matters of the association. 14. These articles of association will be implemented after being approved by various groups.</p>
<p>The Market Panic Has Subsided Slightly Yesterday</p>
<p>After the opening of the Shanghai bean and rice market yesterday morning, because various groups have raised funds to continue ordering foreign rice, and the Municipal Council has negotiated with the Japanese authorities on the free transportation of rice to Shanghai, and at the same time, the transportation of reserves from various places to Shanghai has not been completely cut off, the market panic has subsided slightly. It is also reported that the rice industry group has ordered the market management committee to stop the soaring of rice prices, so as not to affect the livelihood of the common people, and has advised vendors to find ways to transport rice from the producing areas to Shanghai for sale, so as to maintain the food supply of Shanghai. The actual market price of rice yesterday was 36 to 37 yuan per stone for high-quality粳rice.</p>
<p>Resorting to Desperate Measures, Public Security is Worrying</p>
<p>At about 1 PM yesterday, six or seven people suddenly came to a rice shop on Gan Shidong Road, dressed in rags and resembling rickshaw pullers. They grabbed rice from the rice boxes. Fortunately, the nearby police arrived after hearing the alarm and arrested them. They then scattered. The police immediately dispatched more police to guard the area. Rice shops along the road were tightly closed with iron gates, but retail sales continued as usual. The rice shops did not have much rice in stock, but the rice stored in the concessions is now piled up in private residences or hidden locations. The exact amount cannot be determined. Rice delivery trucks were also robbed along the way the night before.</p>
<p>Foreign Newspaper Reports Japanese Purchasing</p>
<p>According to a continental newspaper, the general impression is that Shanghai is currently experiencing a rice shortage due to a rice shortage in Japan. This impression was confirmed yesterday (the 20th). The Japanese agents within China are currently purchasing all available rice, and have entrusted a certain Shanghai shipping company in Saigon to order at least 7,000 tons of rice for immediate delivery. It was heard yesterday that 300,000 bags of various types of rice could be obtained in the suburbs of Shanghai. Farmers only 10 miles outside of Shanghai are currently selling rice for 20 yuan per dan. According to the most responsible sources, people were making large purchases in the suburbs of Shanghai before the end of the week, but by Sunday, only 11,000 bags had arrived in Shanghai. It was heard that another 10,000 bags arrived in Shanghai yesterday, but according to rice merchants, only a small portion of this amount was sold in the local market. It was also heard that the rice to be transported to the Public and French Concessions is now stored in warehouses in Hongkou. Japanese merchants have been hoarding rice there for some time, intending to make huge speculative profits in the Public Concession in the near future, which is without assistance. Merchants in the Public Concession are also hoarding rice, causing prices to continue to rise despite the large amounts of rice being transported in recent days. Rice is still sold for 15 yuan per dan in nearby rice-producing areas, but it is quickly purchased by Japanese merchants. Even rice sold to Shanghai merchants is greatly reduced when it is about to reach its destination, because large quantities have been confiscated.</p>
<p>Free Transportation to Shanghai, Negotiations Going Smoothly</p>
<p>Japan may have a rice shortage this year because large amounts of rice must be transported to the Japanese army in North China. If so, some of the rice stored in Hongkou may be transported to Japan. The Municipal Council acknowledged yesterday that the rice situation has not changed. The Council's negotiations with the Japanese authorities to lift the embargo on Wuhu have not yet received a reply. Also, the English-language "North China Daily News" reported that according to a Municipal Council official, the Municipal Council's discussions with the Japanese authorities to allow more free transportation of rice to Shanghai are progressing smoothly. This issue is expected to be resolved soon.</p>
<p>Songjiang Rice, Large Quantities Coming to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to shipping industry sources, Songjiang rice is being transported to Shanghai in a steady stream. Yesterday, the Minli Company's tugboat towed twelve rice boats, each carrying 115 to 200 dan, for a total of more than 2,000 dan. Today (the 24th), He Li Shipping Company will tow more than 30 boats to Shanghai. If due to the tide, they will arrive tomorrow morning. This second batch of rice totals more than 5,000 dan. It is also understood that the county government in the guerrilla area outside Songjiang is still working as usual. Starting today (the 24th), it will strictly order all rice shops to sell rice at a flat price of 18 yuan per dan. Rice exceeding this price will be confiscated. It is heard that the seriousness of the food problem in the hometown has been completely eliminated. According to reports, the Japanese army in Songjiang only guards one city wall. The four suburbs outside the city are all under the control of the guerrillas. Therefore, the power to manage the food supply is still in the hands of the Chinese army. Also, according to shipping industry sources, the rice price in Wu Ku Zhen above Songjiang has risen to more than 20 yuan per dan, arousing public anger. The rice in all rice shops in the town was moved out and distributed to each household.</p>
<h3>Tongfu Trading Company Employee Falsely Reports Robbery Case; Stolen Goods Recovered, Further Investigation Needed</h3>
<p>Weng Yulin, a Ningbo native (21 years old, resident of 26 Taiwan Road), an employee of Tongfu Inland Trading Company at 260 Tianjin Road, suddenly reported to the French Concession Gaoen Road Police Station at about 10 AM yesterday that he had been ordered by manager Yang Jiqing to collect accounts from various customers. When he was collecting accounts from Yongheng Bank at 266 Ningbo Road, he saw</p>
<p>Three Men</p>
<p>One wearing a Western suit, one wearing a Xiangyun gauze short shirt and pants, and one wearing a long gown, waiting outside the door. When he came out, they immediately grabbed him onto a pre-arranged car. They drove through Henan Road, then Avenue Edward VII, Avenue Foch, Avenue Messimy, and finally arrived at Zhao Zhujiao Road. At that time, the people in the car not only robbed him of the 2,800 yuan he had collected, but also tightly tied his eyes with a white cloth and pushed him out of the car. One of the three men, the one wearing a Western suit, was holding a pistol, etc. The French Police Station believed that the incident occurred in the jurisdiction of the Public Concession Central Police Station, so they transferred the case to that</p>
<p>Police Station for Investigation</p>
<p>After detailed investigation by Chinese Detective Jiang Shangpei, Detective Zhu Wanjun, and Western Detective Gashi Li, it was discovered that Weng's statement was suspicious. The gold ring that Weng was wearing was not robbed. Given the high price of gold, how could the robbers not have robbed the gold ring? Based on the route described by Weng, many detectives sent by the British and French Concession police to search for the car could not have missed it. Therefore, they questioned him in detail. After 12 hours of investigation and interrogation,</p>
<p>The Truth Was Revealed</p>
<p>The reason was that Weng had recently been addicted to gambling, going to gambling dens such as Hollywood Rongsheng, resulting in huge debts that he could not repay. Therefore, he came up with this false report. After receiving 2,800 yuan in gambling debts, he went to Zhonghua Book Company to buy a small leather suitcase, stored the money in it, and deposited it on the third floor of 22 Sijing Road at his cousin Weng Ahai's place. Then he bought a white cloth and hired a car to report to the police station. The detectives later recovered the original 2,800 yuan from 22 Sijing Road. At the same time, they also seized an Yong'an Company passbook with a deposit of more than 100 yuan. The Tongfu Company had recently been stolen 500 yuan worth of</p>
<p>Ninety Pieces of Silk</p>
<p>Whether this was also done by Weng is still under investigation. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court. Police lawyer Jiang Baolian prosecuted him for embezzlement under Article 336 of the Criminal Code. Because further investigation was necessary, he requested a postponement of the hearing. After questioning by Judge Qian Hongye, he was ordered to be detained for a rescheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Car Collision, One Passenger Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>At around 3:15 AM yesterday morning, a black-plated taxi, number 205, was traveling south on Yunnan Road at high speed. While crossing Fuzhou Road, it collided with a silver taxi company car carrying four passengers traveling west on Fuzhou Road. Both cars were damaged, but the silver car was severely damaged and suffered huge losses. One of the four passengers in the car, Liu Minghuai (27 years old, from Ningbo, resident of 52 Xiahui Lane, Xiahui Road, French Concession), had his left shoulder bone broken. The police who arrived at the scene sent the injured to Baojiang Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Beating to Death for a One-Yuan Loan</h3>
<p>Xu Asan from Yancheng quarreled and fought with his fellow townsman Liu Zhichang on Changping Road at 1:50 PM on the 12th of this month because the latter had not repaid a one-yuan loan. Liu was beaten in the waist by Xu and fell to the ground. He was sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment but died. Xu was detained by the Gordon Road Police Station and sent to the First Special Court. After the interrogation was completed, Judge Jiang Shuzi presided over the trial yesterday morning and sentenced Xu Asan to five years in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Bloodshed Occurred on Xinzha Road Yesterday; Yan Jiulin Was Shot Dead; A Letter Was Left Beside the Body; Police Are Investigating</h3>
<p>Yan Jiulin from Shaoxing, 49 years old, resident of Room 12, Hongqing Lane, 140 Xinwen Road, was fast asleep at 6:30 AM yesterday morning when two men suddenly broke in. One wore a black Xiangyun gauze shirt and pants, and the other wore a white cloth shirt and pants. They knocked on the door of Yan's room. Yan woke up and opened the door. The man in black immediately shot Yan twice with a gun. Yan was hit in the head and right breast, and fell into a pool of blood. The shooter took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The injured was sent to Baolong Hospital, but he died shortly after arriving at the hospital due to his serious injuries. After the incident, the police recovered two cartridges of Browning bullets in Yan's room and took them back for research. It is heard that Yan was once the head of the teahouse in a certain theater. Another story is that Yan had been a detective under the late Lu Liankui for many years and has now resigned. Although the reason for the killing is unknown, in addition to the cartridges, the police also found a letter left next to the deceased, which contained the reason for the killing. However, according to general observation, the case appears to be a vendetta. Yan's wife, Wang (30 years old), and a son named Ayuan, 16 years old, also live in the same house.</p>
<h3>Yizhong Tobacco Company Cigarette Robbery Case; Instigating False Accusation Sentenced; Little Hubei Tries to Harm Enemy But Harms Himself; Other Criminals Also Sentenced to Imprisonment</h3>
<p>The Yizhong Tobacco Company, a British company in Lujiazui, Pudong, entrusted Yang Daosheng to transport its cigarettes by barge to various wharves for export. On the night of April 14 of this year, five large boxes of cigarettes, totaling 25,000 cigarettes, worth a considerable amount, were stolen from the barge in the Huangpu River. The company reported to the Water Police Station to request investigation. After the incident, Yao Shengshan, a gangster from Hubei in Pudong, nicknamed Little Xiangbei, intended to gain merit and also intended to</p>
<p>Frame His Enemy</p>
<p>Lin Daoyuan, (Lin is from Anhui and is a cargo foreman at Taikoo Wharf,) and also intended to seize Lin's position. Therefore, he conspired with Lao Qiang Wei Honglin, Lin Maotang, etc. to frame Lin. He asked Wei to come forward and admit that he had stolen the cigarettes under the instructions of Lin Daoyuan, causing Lin to be imprisoned. Yao would be responsible for Wei's family living expenses every month, and Yao would seize Lin Daoyuan's cargo foreman position and pay Wei an additional 15 yuan per month as a reward.</p>
<p>After Agreement</p>
<p>On April 18, Yao reported to the Water Police Station, and Wei Honglin was first arrested. Then Lin Daoyuan and Hu Guiqing (also known as Little Pockmark) were successively arrested, transferred to the French Police Station, and sent to the Second Special Court for investigation. As a result, because Lin Daoyuan's criminal suspicion was insufficient, the French Police Station did not prosecute him and requested that he be released first. Only Wei Honglin and Hu Guiqing were prosecuted for theft, and they were interrogated and detained. Lin Daoyuan learned the details of Yao Shengshan's false accusation and also reported to the French Police Station, requesting an investigation of Yao's false accusation. The French Police Station</p>
<p>Arrested Yao</p>
<p>And the Water Police Station continued to arrest the accomplices of the theft, Shen Jinguo, Yang Hengshun, Zhang Yunshan, etc., and sent them to the Second Special Court. Judge Zhu Chuzhe combined the cases for trial. The police lawyer prosecuted Yao Shengshan for false accusation, Wei Honglin for both false accusation and theft, and the other defendants for theft. During the interrogation, Yao Shengshan admitted that he conspired with Wei Honglin to falsely accuse Lin Daoyuan in order to harm Lin and seize his business. Wei Honglin confessed, "On the 16th, Little Hubei, that is, Yao Shengshan, told Lin Maotang to call me to the Ping'an Hotel,</p>
<p>Called Me to Help</p>
<p>Bite Lin Daoyuan to start a lawsuit, accusing Lin of instructing the theft of Yizhong Tobacco Company cigarettes, promising to subsidize my family expenses, and then give me an additional 15 yuan per month on the wharf. I was confused for a while and followed his false accusation." The other defendants admitted to conspiring to steal cigarettes without denial. The case has been interrogated and concluded. Yesterday morning, Judge Zhu presided over the trial in the Eighth Criminal Court and sentenced Yao Shengshan to</p>
<p>Inciting False Accusation</p>
<p>Three months in prison. Wei Honglin was sentenced to six months in prison for theft and three months in prison for false accusation, serving a total of eight months in prison. Shen Jinguo was sentenced to eight months in prison for theft. Hu Guiqing, Yang Hengshun, and Zhang Yunshan were each sentenced to six months in prison for theft. During the appeal period, the defendants were all detained in the detention center.</p>
<h3>Indecent Behavior in Massage Parlor; Police Strictly Investigate and Handle</h3>
<p>Fang Te'er, the Western head of the vice squad of the Old Kai Police Station, and Hua Sandao Tou, number 1013, in view of the recent situation in various massage parlors, in addition to engaging in prostitution, there are often incidents that harm public morals, so they went to various massage parlors for investigation. At 2:15 PM yesterday, Head Fang and others went to Die Lai Massage Parlor at 601 Ningbo Road for investigation and found Pu Qiting, a worker in the Qian industry, in Massage Room No. 7, completely naked. Wang Xiaomei (21 years old), a prostitute from Wuxi, was also naked beside him, performing manual masturbation for Pu. The heads believed that this action was related to social morals. If they were not severely punished, it would be difficult to warn others. Therefore, they took both the man and woman to the police station. Pu was allowed to be released on bail of 15 yuan, while Wang was detained. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Ninth Criminal Court of the First Court and requested to be severely punished according to law. Judge Shen Shanzeng questioned her and ordered the hearing to be closed to the public because the case concerned morals. As a result, they were given severe punishment to reverse the declining morality.</p>
<h3>Forcing a Young Girl into Prostitution; Three Criminals Severely Punished Separately</h3>
<p>Wang Lindi (25 years old), a woman from Yancheng, and Li Laoer (28 years old), a woman from Changzhou, have recently been living the life of prostitutes in the Hongkou area. Last month, Wang Lindi took her 14-year-old adopted daughter, Zeng Cuihong, to Room 3 of the Huishan Hotel at 10 Dongbaihui Road and had her defiled by Yu Hengshun (28 years old), a traveler from Yangzhou, while Li Laoer helped in the middle. Afterwards, Zeng felt pain in her lower body and walked unsteadily, but forced by Wang Lindi's coercion, she could not escape. Until about 4 PM on the 15th of this month, she took the opportunity to escape and was wandering near Xiaoshadu Road when she was discovered by Chinese police number 3305 of the Xinzha Police Station. She was taken to the police station, and the police found out the details. The head ordered her to be transferred to the Huishan Police Station. At the same time, Wang Lindi, Li Laoer, and Yu Hengshun, three men and women, were detained by the First Court and interrogated in the case. Zeng was sent to Jiliang Institute for care. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi continued to hear the case in court. The case concerned morals and was closed to the public. As a result, Wang Lindi was sentenced to nine years and six months in prison, Li Laoer was sentenced to three years, and Yu Hengshun was sentenced to seven years, separately as a warning.</p>
<h3>Deformed Fetus, Surgical Procedure</h3>
<p>Huang Zhixian, the wife of Yu Datong, a teacher at the Municipal Council Primary School, was about to give birth and was admitted to the First Hospital of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Haige Road on the 15th of this month. At noon on the 16th, she gave birth to a boy with an abnormally protruding navel. The obstetrics hospital summoned surgeons and pediatricians for consultation. Upon examination, it was found that the umbilical cord was severely swollen near the abdomen. The protruding part was only covered by a membrane, and a small hole was visible on the upper right of the membrane with a small amount of yellow gelatinous seepage flowing out. After discussion, the doctors determined that it was an umbilical hernia. (A hernia is when an organ protrudes. If the intestines are squeezed and not surgically returned to the abdomen, the child will die.) The current condition shows that the internal organs are squeezed into the umbilical cord. Surgery should be performed to seek a glimmer of hope. They informed the child's father, Yu Datong, that the infant's condition was serious. Since the membrane had begun to rupture, the internal organs would inevitably leak out completely, leading to death. Therefore, without surgery, there would be no cure. Performing surgery may offer a glimmer of hope, but because newborns are physically weak, there is a possibility of death before and after surgery. The child's father expressed understanding of this point and signed a surgical consent form. A photo was taken before the surgery (see photo). After the surgeon cut open the hernia sac, the entire swollen liver, gallbladder, and part of the large and small intestines were visible. The doctor tried to return the intestines to the abdominal cavity, but because the abdominal cavity was too small and the abdominal wall was underdeveloped, it was unusually narrow and could not accommodate the swollen liver and gallbladder. With the consent of the child's parents, and after the two jointly signed the surgical consent form, the fascia was cut from the mother's leg and sewn to the infant's abdominal wound to prevent the intestines from leaking out and to isolate the abdominal cavity from the outside. The child died one hour after the surgery. According to an investigation by the reporter, and after finding a photo of the infant, it is attached below for research by all sectors.</p>
<h3>Robbery Case in Xujiahui Town</h3>
<p>The home of Zhou Fengting, a local resident who works as a tea servant at the Renji Hall at the Tie Lu Kou, Shizi Wan No. 18 on the west side of Xujiahui Town, was suddenly invaded by six robbers at 8:30 PM the night before. They were wearing Xiangyun gauze short shirts and pants and spoke with a Hakka accent. Three of them were each carrying a pistol, and two robbers were guarding the door. They robbed 80 yuan in legal tender and severely injured Zhou Fengting. After obtaining the stolen goods, they broke into the room of Zhou's newly married son-in-law, Ai Likang, and robbed him of 400 yuan in legal tender, a gold ring, a gold bracelet, two large and small leather suitcases, and more than 50 pieces of silk clothing. Ai's mother, Shen, argued slightly and was hit on the head with the butt of a gun by the robbers, and her face was covered with blood. After 20 minutes, they fled towards Hongqiao Road. Yesterday, the victims filed a report with the French police in charge and requested an investigation.</p>
<h3>Epidemic in the Two Concessions Is Becoming Increasingly Rampant; True Cholera Cases Continue to Be Discovered</h3>
<p>Recently, the epidemic situation in various parts of the city has become increasingly rampant. Shanghai Epidemic Hospital on Yuqiaqing Road has continuously discovered five patients with true cholera in recent weeks. One, Chen Cai, is a peddler living at 72 Xiaodongmen Road. One, Xu Lu, is a female worker at British American Tobacco Company living at 8 Laobaian Lane, Min Tini Yin Road. One, Qian Weisheng, is a coppersmith living at 412 Jiaozhou Road. One, Wu Jin, lives at 147 Da Tong Road. One, Zhang Xiaoyou, is a coppersmith living at 1254 Jiangxi Road. Yesterday and the day before yesterday, several suspected cases of true cholera were discovered in the city, and their feces have been sent to the Municipal Council Health Department for testing. This shows that the spread of the epidemic is alarming. We urge residents to regulate their diet and not indulge in gluttony, so as to maintain their health.</p>
<h3>Robbers Open Fire and Wound a Person</h3>
<p>Cao Hongkai, a 41-year-old man from Nantong, who has been farming vegetables in the Hongzhen countryside in eastern Shanghai, was suddenly confronted by more than ten robbers at 11 o'clock the night before. They swarmed into the residence of a Mr. Someone next door to rob it. Cao, upon hearing the alarm, immediately opened his door and went out to investigate. He was shot in the left chest by one of the robbers acting as a lookout at the gate. Bleeding profusely, he was taken to Tongren Hospital for treatment in a rickshaw.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor,</p>
<p>I am writing to you because my client, Dong Yongjun, has informed me that the report in today's Shen Bao local news section regarding the instigation of a violent act does not align with the facts. My client has a contract with Chen Yunhua for the lease of the Katte Grand Theatre, which stipulates that he has the right of first refusal for continued lease after six months, provided that he formally notifies the other party one month in advance. In other words, the lessee can only terminate the lease if they express their intention to do so. Once the lessee has indicated their intention to continue the lease, the lessor cannot object. Unexpectedly, on the 6th of this month, at 7:00 AM, some unknown ruffians, posing as police officers, arrived at the theatre with over a dozen White Russians and forcibly occupied it. My client reported this to the Avenue Edward VII Police Station, who sent officers to investigate and ordered both parties not to operate the theatre, with the police temporarily guarding it pending a court resolution. Because the other party had already applied to the court for mediation which was unsuccessful, a lawsuit has been filed in accordance with the law. There was no battery, assault, or vandalism. Most of the equipment was added by my client, so there is no reason for him to destroy it himself. If such events had occurred, the police would have already initiated a public prosecution, so why would it be necessary to file a private prosecution now? Clearly, the report is completely inconsistent with the facts. I am deeply concerned that the public may be misled by the lack of accurate information and have therefore commissioned a representative to write to your chief editor requesting that this letter of correction be published in the "Letter to the Editor" section to avoid misunderstandings. This is a matter of public interest. Respectfully submitted to the distinguished Chief Editor of the Newspaper, Lawyer Wang Shizong, August 22, Year 28.</p>

<h3>Declaration of the Summer Health Exhibition</h3>
<p>The summer season has arrived, afflicting people. We live in noisy metropolitan cities, the environment is confined, the air is polluted, and the food is unsanitary. During this summer season, diseases and epidemics are particularly active, causing disturbances such as typhoid fever, cholera, and dysentery, killing countless people every year and harming society. A single act of carelessness can lead to infection and endanger lives. Thinking about this makes one shudder.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island, it has sheltered tens of thousands of refugees who still languish along the Shanghai Bund, leading unsettled lives. During this summer season, these people are confined to various shelters, where crowded conditions make the heat unbearable and exacerbate their suffering. The risk of disease and epidemics is particularly high, and if infections spread, not only will the lives of one or a few individuals be at stake, but the entire refugee population will be at risk. Therefore, the public officials responsible for the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association and leaders from all sectors of society have launched a campaign to raise funds for refugee health, advocating for the refugees. Their actions are admirable and worthy of respect.</p>
<p>We also deeply feel the importance of this responsibility. Relieving the refugees and eradicating epidemics is an urgent task for us. Although we recognize our limited strength, we dare not shirk our duty. Therefore, we have scheduled a three-day Summer Health Exhibition from August 24th to August 26th at the Ningbo Association Hall, showcasing various health models and charts related to summer health to promote awareness. In addition, we will also conduct preventive vaccinations, charitable sales of medicine, and promote the sale of philanthropy badges, to raise public awareness of summer health and to solicit the sympathy and assistance of all sectors of society for the fundraising efforts for refugee relief. We hope that all citizens and members of society will actively support us, ensuring that the funds raised are entirely used to provide for the refugees, fulfilling our moral responsibility, and expanding the impact to promote the success of the overall summer health movement, reduce epidemics, and maintain public health. If we can achieve this, we will be fortunate, the refugees will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate!</p>
<h3>Announcement Regarding the Postponement of the Exhibition</h3>
<p>Initial preparations were complete, but the concession's state of alert required a delay.</p>
<p>As we approach the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, promoting health awareness is even more urgent.</p>
<p>We recognized that Shanghai's population is dense, and the risk of illness is high, especially during the summer months when epidemics are rampant and contagious. Furthermore, we observed that on this isolated island, there are still tens of thousands of refugees living in cramped conditions, suffering from the scorching heat and lacking the necessary health funds, making the need for funds even more pressing. Therefore, we initiated the Summer Health Exhibition to raise public awareness of health, eliminate disease, and generate funds through the sale of medicine to provide relief to the refugees, fulfilling our moral duty.</p>
<p>Since the launch of this initiative, we have received the agreement and support of the officials of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association, as well as the love and support of manufacturers, pharmacies, organizations, and individuals from all sectors of society. Some have generously contributed articles, others have donated medicine, and still others have promoted the sale of vouchers, providing both spiritual and material assistance, which has made us feel even more encouraged and motivated to work harder!</p>
<p>However, regarding the date of the exhibition, the event was originally scheduled to open at the Ningbo Association Hall from August 7th to 9th, and all preparations were complete. However, an unexpected incident occurred. Due to the second anniversary of the Battle of Shanghai, the concession authorities, in order to ensure the safety of citizens, implemented a state of alert from August 7th to 15th, suspending all gatherings and instructing us to postpone the event. We had no choice but to comply and reschedule the event to today (the 24th). Although the delay was not our fault, we feel deeply apologetic for not being able to anticipate and prevent this situation beforehand.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, now that we are at the end of summer and the beginning of autumn, based on past experience, various epidemics and infectious diseases tend to be most active and rampant at this time (early autumn), and the population mortality rate also peaks at this time. This is because the nature of the climate changes from summer to autumn, but people often fail to pay attention to this. A moment of carelessness can lead to illness. Therefore, although we have delayed the event until now, we feel that promoting health awareness is even more important and urgent. We dare not only encourage ourselves, but also hope that everyone will understand, support, and correct us!</p>
<h3>Honorary Committee of the Exhibition</h3>
<p>Chairman: Mr. Yu Qiaqing, Mr. Wen Lanting, Mr. Guan Jiongzhi, Mr. Xu Xiaochu, Mr. Xu Guan</p>
<p>Members: Mr. Xu Xiangsun, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Pan Yangyao, Mr. Fang Jiaobai, Mr. Xi Yushu, Mr. Gao Peiliang, Mr. Xu Jimiao, Mr. Fan Ruitang, Mr. Lu Zhixue, Mr. Yuan Hesongguang, Mr. Gu Kediao, Mr. Xiao Zongjun</p>
<h3>The Significance of the Summer Health Exhibition Organized by the Yiyou Society</h3>
<p>— Xi Yushu</p>
<p>The Yiyou Society is composed of shop employees from various stores in Shanghai and is a pure organization that enhances the physical and mental well-being of young working people. It has always been eager to take the lead in public welfare undertakings, so the Yiyou Society has established a reputation in Shanghai society. The Yiyou Society regrets that it was unable to participate in advance in the "Shanghai Refugee Relief Association Fundraising Health Expenses Committee" organized by ten groups including pharmaceutical and medical professions. However, its spirit of courage and righteousness has never wavered. The "Summer Health Exhibition" it is organizing has been approved and supported by the Fundraising Health Expenses Committee. The considerations of this exhibition are very far-reaching. The Yiyou Society bears the responsibility of publicity and makes up for the shortcomings of the Fundraising Committee. In the future, it will reap great benefits. Exhibition publicity is one of the important factors, and this exhibition can be said to be appropriate for the occasion. The word "health" has become the most popular term on the streets today, but the understanding of the meaning and importance of health has not yet penetrated deeply and universally. The Yiyou Society can take advantage of this opportunity to collect health information, hold an exhibition, enlighten citizens about health knowledge, and guide them in strategies for preventing epidemics, which is really appropriate for the time. Therefore, the Summer Health Exhibition organized by the Yiyou Society is timely and appropriate and is truly a win-win situation.</p>
<h3>Why Hold a Summer Health Exhibition?</h3>
<p>— Jiang Junyi</p>
<p>The Yiyou Society is scheduled to hold a Summer Health Exhibition at the Ningbo Association Hall from August 24th to 26th. Its motivation is not only to raise public awareness of summer health in Shanghai but also for the public good. This is a highly commendable act of justice in the consistent spirit of the Yiyou Society serving the community.</p>
<p>Although in the past year or two, the Shanghai Concession authorities have made great efforts in summer health, universally administering preventive measures and carrying out various health promotion activities to prevent problems before they arise, which has achieved great results, this kind of summer health promotion is not a matter of a single period or direction. It must be promoted and worked on by all social groups and organizations together, and then greater results can be achieved. Therefore, the Yiyou Society's Summer Health Exhibition can also be said to be a contribution to the Concession authorities in promoting summer health awareness among citizens.</p>
<p>The Refugee Relief Association in this city has recently confirmed that this is a public welfare act that is urgently needed at present, and it is indeed of great importance to the safety of all citizens in Shanghai. The Yiyou Society's exhibition can also be said to be a response to the Refugee Relief Association's act of seeking welfare for the refugees and jointly fulfilling its responsibility to serve society. I congratulate the Yiyou Society on the great success of this Summer Health Exhibition!</p>
<h3>For What?</h3>
<p>— Zhao Puchu</p>
<p>These days, the Summer Health Exhibition is once again intensifying the atmosphere in the Yiyou Society. Some people say, "For what? They are always so unafraid of being busy, and they are not afraid of the heat and passion, and they really like them very much. Being busy and sweating is our own summer health movement."</p>
<p>But really, for what?</p>
<p>We have stated repeatedly that the Yiyou Society was created because of the needs of society. Specifically, there are many people in the real world who need help: economically, intellectually, morally, health-wise, and in all aspects of life, they all need help. However, what they can get is so small and pitiful! Therefore, the Yiyou Society was created under this kind of need, and the Yiyou Society has grown up in this kind of "helping" work.</p>
<p>Speaking of this Summer Health Exhibition, of course, it is not a very remarkable thing. For us, it is just a hope to follow the service spirit of the advanced people from all walks of life in Shanghai and to do our best in the movement to raise funds for summer health for the refugees after joining the Refugee Relief Association. However, the encouragement and support we have received from the advanced people from all walks of life has exceeded what we should have received—it is particularly large and particularly enthusiastic. This not only makes us more energetic in this work, and we are not afraid of sweating, but also makes us have a clearer confidence in the work we have done in the past.</p>
<p>We will use this health exhibition as the starting point for making a greater contribution to society, and continue to do our best to engage in things that benefit people, so that more people can be helped. If we can achieve even one ten-thousandth of the result, what is the "busyness" and "heat"?</p>
<p>I remember that Sakyamuni Buddha once said this sentence: "I am bearing a body of blood and flesh for the benefit of the world." This should be able to answer the question "For what?"!</p>
<h3>Besides "I" and "Gold"</h3>
<p>— Fan</p>
<p>Perhaps because of the saying that "Shanghai is full of gold," people's consideration of all problems, in addition to how to connect "I" and "gold," seems to be unable to think of other things, and even feels that there are no other problems in the world!</p>
<p>We have stated repeatedly that the Yiyou Society was created because of the needs of society; specifically, it is because there are actually many important problems in the world besides how to connect "I" and "gold," and they need to be solved; and the focus of the problem is on how to expand the scope of "I" so that people can also do some "big I" things outside of the "small I." The Yiyou Society was created under this kind of need, and it has grown up in this kind of work; naturally, it should continue and expand in this way in the future.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai became an isolated island, the area of residence has shrunk, but the population has increased greatly. There are naturally many reasons for this, which do not need to be studied here, but the result of the population increase has made the already serious housing problem even more serious. More than a dozen families live in one house, which used to be a topic for cartoonists, but now it has long lost its capital. It is common for three families to live in one pavilion. We can imagine that when the protagonists who live in this house return to this "home" to rest with their tired bodies after the usual twelve or thirteen hours of work, the chances of disease and death are not difficult to imagine. But, after all, they are still living in houses. As for the refugees who survived the shelling, and the poorest people who live in reed sheds like the refugees, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Yiyou Society has grown up in the work of "serving the big I." This means that we have already had many services in the past, but we are not satisfied, and we will never be satisfied in the future. This Summer Health Exhibition is to respond to the call of the Refugee Relief Association, which is combined with the "big I" spirit of the leaders of all walks of life in Shanghai. We hope to do our best in the great work of raising funds for summer health for the refugees; at the same time, we want to use this exhibition as the starting point for making a greater contribution to society. We will inherit and carry forward the spirit of this exhibition.</p>
<h3>Talk About Summer Health Movement</h3>
<p>— Yan Fan</p>
<p>Summer is coming, this terrible season, the scorching sun, the oppressive heat, the invasion of epidemics, the difficulty of the heat wave!, indeed, summer is a serious threat and a terrible shadow to people!</p>
<p>According to the annual report of the Public Works Bureau last year, the death rate of the public concession alone in 1938 was 55,609 people. We can predict that this alarming number must account for the largest number in the summer, and the epidemics and typhoid fever in the diseases. Stomach problems, etc., are most likely to occur in late summer and early autumn, and most of those who suffer from the disease are our colleagues and working people. This can be proven in every college and pharmacy, because we are the worst-living people in society, living in narrow residences and eating unclean food. In addition, we work all day long, which of course has a great relationship with maintaining our health!</p>
<p>Therefore, "Yiyou Society" has long felt the importance and urgency of the summer health problems of our vast community members. We have been working hard and actively to fight for the relief of the suffering and national crisis of this problem. Over the past half month, we have launched and prepared the "Summer Health Epidemic Prevention Movement" and implemented free epidemic prevention injections in the community from June 27 to July 15. Today, the community is holding a Summer Health Exhibition to respond to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's solicitation of refugee health funds. We hope that all members will pay extra attention, which is closely related to our interests, and must not miss this opportunity. At the same time, everyone must participate in and complete this movement so that we can become more literate and more universal, so that all members can extend to all refugees and all citizens can enjoy this benefit.</p>
<p>The devil of disease is a robber, and the epidemic is as vicious as the invaders. We hope that everyone will make every effort to launch and complete this summer health movement with the greatest enthusiasm and the same spirit of preventing invasion and disaster!</p>
<h3>Summer Health and Well-being</h3>
<p>— Shi Zhifu</p>
<p>The level of climate temperature has a great impact on the human body, just like what Fahrenheit said: Being quietly in a hot environment is the same as working hard in cold weather, so the body is most easily consumed, fatigued, and even weakened in resistance in the summer. Furthermore, highly contagious germs such as cholera and typhoid fever are most suitable for the intense environment, so their rampant period is also in this season. The spread of disease is entirely due to mosquitoes, and they are also the most common thing in summer and autumn. In short, the health of the human body is most threatened in summer, especially in the two concessions where the population is crowded. It is difficult to popularize pharmaceutical equipment, and the general health knowledge of each family cannot be known to every resident. Often, the neglect of a patient causes a family, a neighborhood, or even spreads out, making it uncontrollable. What is different in recent years is that tens of thousands of refugees have been added. Because they have been affected by the war, they have become homeless, living in dark and dilapidated houses, dozens or hundreds of them squeezed together, with no tables, no chairs, and no beds. They lie on the ground, including excretion, all together. How can such a life guarantee no danger! If an infectious disease occurs, it will soon spread throughout the entire place, naturally expanding to a wider range, adding a threat to the residents of the concession. The so-called fire in the city gate affects the fish in the moat, but it is probably too late to climax relief by that time. Therefore, the purpose of the association is to make the public understand health knowledge, and at the same time collect donations, promote the sale of goods, assist refugees, improve their health facilities, reduce the threat of disease, seek safety for refugees, and also seek safety for the millions of compatriots living in the concession. I hope that all sectors will provide more help!</p>

<h3>Transfer of the General Office of the Vocational Education Society from Guilin to Chongqing</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, the general office of the Chinese Vocational Education Society moved from Shanghai to Guilin, continuing its work and establishing offices in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Shanghai. The situation was quite good. It is reported that the general office will move from Guilin to Chongqing, while the original Sichuan office will remain. Currently, the society is focusing its efforts on vocational guidance for refugees, mobile education, and other work.</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Guangdong and Guangxi Educators' Association in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Since its establishment a year ago, the Guangdong and Guangxi Educators' Association in Shanghai has been engaged in various activities, such as weekly educational and health broadcasts on the Xinxin Company radio and the establishment of a Youth Education Promotion Association to lead extracurricular activities. These efforts have been well received by the public. Yesterday (the 22nd) at 10:00 AM, a general membership meeting was held with over eighty attendees.

<h3>Exploitation</h3>
<p>— Yang Jinhao</p>
<p>Hitler, exploiting Chamberlain's anti-communist wishes, signed the "Anti-Comintern Pact" with Japan and Italy, using the guise of an anti-communist vanguard to deceive Britain into tacit agreement, annexing Austria and Czechoslovakia in Central Europe, and then attempting to invade Poland in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Chamberlain, exploiting Hitler's "anti-communist" stance, willingly allowed the little dictator to advance into Central Europe, hoping that he would quickly seize Ukraine and fight Stalin, so that he could sit back and wait for the removal of the thorn in his side, the Soviet Union, and reap the benefits in the event of a mutually destructive conflict.</p>
<p>Who knew that the result of "anti-communism" was the exclusive occupation of weak countries, and the seizure of colonies from Britain and France. To avoid being fooled again, Chamberlain used Stalin, putting on an "anti-aggression" facade, pretending to establish an "Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance" to force Hitler to comply and quickly cash the "anti-communist" check, letting the Soviet Union take the brunt of the fighting.</p>
<p>Stalin, however, exploited Chamberlain's insincerity, cleverly maneuvering in front of Hitler, signing a "Commercial Agreement" with Germany and negotiating a "Non-Aggression Pact" while discussing the "Anglo-Franco-Soviet alliance". In this way, he also exploited Hitler to implement his "peace" policy, letting those imperialists quarrel and fight each other.</p>
<p>In international relations, there is only a struggle for interests, and no war of ideologies. However, there are differences in the scope of vision and the ingenuity of methods.</p>
<p>It seems that the most cunning one is Chamberlain, but his vision is the most short-sighted and his methods the most clumsy. The "appeasement policy" and the "Munich Conference," in the fantasy of instigating a "anti-Soviet" war, have repeatedly harmed his own interests and weakened his own hegemony. If he continues to be generous at the expense of others, trying to trick others into being "fooled," then he can only continue to be "generous" himself and continue to be fooled.</p>
<p>Hitler's exploitation of Chamberlain has reached its limit, so there is no need to shout about "anti-communism" anymore; now he is going to provoke the timid and cowardly, raising the banner of "anti-British". However, if he continues to take risks, he will indeed make Britain and France suffer, but he himself will also change from a nouveau riche back into a bankrupt.</p>
<p>Stalin's methods are still the most ingenious, turning the Soviet Union from being "isolated" by encirclement on all sides into being "isolated" with flattery from all sides. The future world war is no longer a war against aggression, but a war of imperialists. The Soviet Union will never fall into the trap of provoking war by old foxes, but will make the imperialists fight each other to the death. This is Stalin's high opinion now.</p>
<p>However, what kind of situation will ultimately result from this international mutual exploitation cannot yet be predicted. Let's listen to the next episode!</p>
<h3>Pivot</h3>
<p>— Ziju</p>
<p>Four minor celebrities were leisurely sitting in room number two of the ×× Restaurant. The central figure was Li, the comprador of the ×× Trading Company. But he felt very uncomfortable because Zhou ××, who was only an assistant manager in the ×× Bank, was fat, and Shao, the administrative director in the ×× Foreign Company, was also fat. As for the other one, also fat, named Jin ×, who was a deputy bank manager, but Li the comprador was skinny, absolutely lacking the demeanor that gentlemen should have. So, facing these three characters, Li the comprador himself couldn't believe that he was a gentleman with hundreds of thousands of fortunes.</p>
<p>After the serious matters were settled, they simply couldn't find a way to pass the time, which was also quite painful.</p>
<p>Suddenly, that Director Shao put down his wine glass and said with emotion:</p>
<p>"Zhao ×× is simply outrageous. He's full of rice and only minds other people's business, meddling and making it all unclear..."</p>
<p>Then he sighed.</p>
<p>Comprador Li, with a "weird" expression, quickly asked:</p>
<p>"Old Shao, what's the matter? What did Zhao ×× come to bother you about?"</p>
<p>"Humph, humph."</p>
<p>He snorted through his nose and slowly said, "He said that the refugees housed in the refugee shelters are having difficulties with supplies..."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes..."</p>
<p>Deputy Manager Jin ×× interrupted as if a martial artist had jumped out from backstage: "He came to me too, going on and on, saying a lot about refugee this and refugee that. Sigh, I simply didn't want to listen..."</p>
<p>"That's right, who wants to listen," Comprador Li exhaled the cigar smoke he had inhaled violently. He seemed to see a letter from Zhao ×× in the smoke, and he said resentfully: "He's really like a (blank) trickster," especially giving me a letter. At first, I thought he was recommending some business, who knew..."</p>
<p>"What? " the director quickly asked.</p>
<p>"What else can it be," the comprador said quickly, "it's still about refugees, it's really annoying, and he even wants me to reply!" He took another puff of his cigar.</p>
<p>Jin × blinked, he said angrily:</p>
<p>"Li, he's being quite polite to you."</p>
<p>"Polite? Humph." The other party said coldly.</p>
<p>"To me, he's frankly and rudely demanding," the deputy bank manager slammed his cup on the table, "he's asking me to sponsor ten refugees every month..."</p>
<p>Comprador Li frowned and thought: "He's sponsoring ten, doesn't that mean I have to sponsor twenty."</p>
<p>"Do you think, isn't he hateful?" The deputy bank manager just shook his head, "He's so happy for the refugees, what are refugees anyway?"</p>
<p>At this time, Assistant Manager Zhou spoke, shaking his head slightly:</p>
<p>"Zhao is a distant relative of mine. He was very polite at first, but who knew he came yesterday, and it was all refugees this and that, such a long speech, I simply couldn't stand it, but he shamelessly came to demand from me too."</p>
<p>"Um, um."</p>
<p>Comprador Li stretched lazily.</p>
<p>"He said that gasoline is now selling for two yuan and four jiao per gallon, and told me to drive less often, so that there would be a considerable surplus to help the refugees. Do you think, am I supposed to take the tram and the public bus?"</p>
<p>"Yes, yes!"</p>
<p>Comprador Li touched his thin chin.</p>
<p>Administrative Director Shao said coldly:</p>
<p>"Little Zhou, he was at least discussing with you. But me, he was lecturing me like an old guy. I often go to dance halls and movie theaters, but that's just to relieve the dryness of work. Later, he even said this to me, 'Cutting down on a few dances and one or two movies is enough to pay for one refugee's monthly expenses.' How unreasonable!" He sighed repeatedly, followed by a burst of cold laughter.</p>
<p>"He really has mental problems."</p>
<p>Comprador Li closed his eyes, then suddenly opened them, thought for a moment, and called out loudly, "Oh, boy! Oh!"</p>
<p>The boy scurried in like a mouse, standing stiffly in front of them.</p>
<p>"Bring beer; also, call the ×× Company and tell them to hurry up."</p>
<p>The boy retreated again stiffly.</p>
<p>Jin ×'s spirits seemed to be flagging, and he yawned blankly, falling onto the sofa with a thud and waving his hand.</p>
<p>The spittoon sighed, "Psh!"</p>

<h3>Two Bandits</h3>
<p>— Written by John Aikin, Translated by Zhu Yusun</p>
<p>Characters: Alexander—the famous Greek leader</p>
<p>Leader of the Balkan Peninsula—a bandit chief</p>
<p>Alexander (hereinafter referred to as A): Ha! Are you the bandit of the Balkan Peninsula? I already know much about your deeds.</p>
<p>Bandit Chief of the Balkan Peninsula (hereinafter referred to as B): I am an islander of the Balkan Peninsula, a soldier.</p>
<p>A: Hmph! Soldier? More like a thief, a robber, a rogue, a scourge of society. I admire your audacity, but I hate you and must punish you.</p>
<p>B: What have I done that you should control me?</p>
<p>A: Haven't you defied my authority and disrupted public peace? Isn't your life entirely spent harming the lives and property of your compatriots?</p>
<p>B: Alexander! Although I am your prisoner, I must listen to what you are pleased to say and endure the punishments you bestow. But my heart cannot be subdued. Would I be freed if I refuted the various crimes you accuse me of?</p>
<p>A: Speak! Although I have the power to stop you from speaking, I do not deign to do so.</p>
<p>B: Then, before answering your questions, I must ask you, how have you lived your life?</p>
<p>A: The life of a hero! If you ask about my reputation, it will fully tell you that among the brave, I am the bravest, among the emperors, I am the noblest, and among the conquerors, I am the greatest.</p>
<p>B: Isn't my reputation the same? Where is there a leader as brave as I am? Where? But I don't deign to boast. You must know that I am not easily subdued!</p>
<p>A: But what are you? You are nothing but a bandit, a vulgar person, a dishonest thief.</p>
<p>B: What is a conqueror? In this world, you are nothing but a malicious trickster. You destroy peace, the brilliant fruits of industry, you (blank space) rob, (blank space), slaughter, abandon laws, have no justice, and only know how to fill your endless desire for territory. Aren't you like this? In total, I only help about a hundred companions to operate in small areas, while what you and your tens of millions of colleagues do affects the fate of the entire nation. If I am robbing single travelers, then you are killing the masses. If I am burning down some villages, then you are destroying and trampling the most prosperous countries and cities in the world. The only difference between you and me is that I am only a selfish me, while you are an emperor, a bandit more powerful than me!</p>
<p>A: But while I enjoy the rights of an emperor, I also grant the treatment of an emperor to others. While I destroy capitals, I can build even bigger ones. Moreover, I am promoting art, commerce, and philosophy!</p>
<p>B: Am I not doing the same? I take the property of the rich, but I also naturally provide for the poor. Among the wicked, I also establish order and teach lessons. I also extend my hand to protect oppressed compatriots. Indeed, I am not very clear about the philosophy you speak of, but I know that even you or I must redeem half of the infamy that you and I have left in this world.</p>
<p>A: Get out! Are we the same? Alexander is a bandit? Let me think about it!</p>

<h3>From "Nine Whirlwinds" to Saying Song Dezhu (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Only Me</p>
<p>—Also Introducing Four Students of the Opera School</p>
<p>News has arrived that the master of a generation, the renowned martial actress Nine Whirlwinds (Yan Lanqiu), passed away from illness in the old capital some days ago. This is not only a great loss to the opera world, but there will never be another martial actress talent like him. The role of martial actress is "difficult," so not many people study it. Because not many study it, for the past twenty years, there has been no one like Nine Whirlwinds. A martial actress who is only skilled in martial arts cannot be considered a complete talent. She must be beautiful, have a refined spirit, sing sweetly, and have skillful techniques to be considered perfect. Nine Whirlwinds not only had superior martial arts skills, but also a voice and beautiful appearance. He could still perform "The Little Buffalo Boy," "Hongni Pass," and "Battle of Wancheng." Eight years before retiring with a beard to teach and enjoy his later years, Zhu Shengfu and Yan Shishan, who quickly graduated, were taught by him. Now that Nine Whirlwinds has passed away, some say his nephew Yan Shishan has considerable talent and will surely inherit his uncle's mantle. While this may be true, Shishan is unlikely to be comparable to Lanqiu. The one who can become the second Nine Whirlwinds and be considered a perfect talent should be Song Dezhu.</p>
<p>Song Dezhu is a top student at the Beiping Opera School. While at school, he, Zhao Jinrong, Wang Helin, and Wang Jinlu were leading figures. Dezhu originally studied martial actress, so he has a solid foundation in martial arts. Later, he also performed roles of the young female characters. Because of his talent, he has achieved considerable success. Dezhu has a beautiful appearance, a good voice, and excellent stage presence. His techniques and acrobatic skills are unique. His tumbling in "Two Wolf Pass" is unprecedented. Other plays, such as "Hongqiao Presents Pearls," "Loyal Martyrs," and "Yang Jiaofeng," were all popular at the time. He also excels in warrior roles, such as "Sister Thirteen," "Muke Village," and "The Women's Army." Since graduating, he formed the Yingguang Troupe and performed in Ping. It is said that he sings all kinds of operas, including "Farewell My Concubine" and "Fourth Son Visits His Mother." While this shows Dezhu's versatility, these roles are not suitable for him and may be counterproductive. When Xu Biyun was studying at Binqing Troupe, she originally studied martial actress, but her martial actress skills were not very good. After graduating, she relied on her voice and switched to Qingyi and Huashan roles. However, her abandonment of her original specialty was due to environmental factors. Dezhu's martial actress roles are already excellent, and his warrior roles are already an extra. Now he wants to perform Qingyi and Huashan roles. Not only is it illogical, but it also hinders his future. The reason why Li Wanchun could not inherit Yang Xiaolou's legacy is that he liked to show off his skills and even sang "Arrest and Release" and "Empty City Stratagem." This is a good example to learn from, and Dezhu should think twice. It is said that the Golden Grand Theater has invited Dezhu and will perform with Yang Baosen in Shanghai. I sincerely hope he accepts my advice and does not perform outside his scope. Dezhu has many private operas, with at least fifty martial actress and warrior roles. Since Dezhu's martial arts are excellent, he should offer them to the audience. Since Yu Yuqin and Nine Whirlwinds have passed away, Song Dezhu is the ideal figure for the audience. I hope Dezhu can become a modern Yu Yuqin and Nine Whirlwinds, and I do not want Dezhu to be compared to the Four Great Dan, this is my meaning.</p>

<h3>One Aspect of Acting Experience (Part 2)</h3>

<p>Discussing the Difficulty of Playing Villains Versus Heroes</p>
<p>Playing a villain is an actor playing a role; playing a hero is the role playing the actor. Because in every film, whether it's the script, visuals, or supporting roles, the focus is mostly on the hero, and everyone else is used to highlight him. Therefore, playing this kind of role is effortless and easily wins the audience's sympathy. The performance of a villain, on the other hand, goes against everything, often arousing great aversion from the audience. At the same time, this aversion is a great help to the hero. In other words, it's almost like acting for the hero. For example, the more the audience hates the villain, the more sympathy they give the hero. Therefore, the actual gain still belongs to the hero. The villain is often in a supporting role and easily overlooked and unrewarded.</p>
<p>Looking at the current international stage, German leader Hitler is a famous villain. Under his consistent policy of aggression, he acts perversely and does everything. He is so fierce. Such acting with sound and color is very difficult, but his harvest from the audience is only resentment and curses. There are almost no people applauding him. On the other hand, American President Roosevelt is a hero. He only needs to lightly send a few telegrams upholding justice against Hitler's reckless and unreasonable fallacies, without much effort, and he has already won worldwide praise and applause. It is clear that Hitler is acting for him on the negative side. If there were no hateful villain, the hero would not be so respectable and lovable.</p>
<p>In short, playing a hero is the normal situation, while playing a villain is an abnormal performance. The difficulty between them is clear. After playing heroes for a long time, I switched to playing villains for many years and have had a deeper experience of this. My opinion has always been that an actor should be able to play many kinds of roles. In recent years, I have only played villains, which is entirely due to the environment and not my own wish. To put it more deeply, it is a regret in my heart.</p>
<h3>A Short Preface to the Ankang Gathering (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>What does the word Ankang mean? There is no definite conclusion, but it is commonly known as Tanhuang, which is undeniable. However, I believe that Southern and Northern dramas originally took place names. Yue Opera, Qin Opera, and Kun Opera are the most obvious examples, and Pihuang is the same. The word Ankang is actually the names of Lin'an and Jiankang. The Southern Song Dynasty moved its capital to Lin'an, which was inherited from Jiankang. By the time of Emperor Gongzong, Yuan Boyan occupied Lin'an, and Zhao Min, who was left to guard the Nanjing palace, had already abandoned Jiankang and fled. When Wen Tianxiang came out of the northern camp, the seven-character quatrains he composed, connected one after another, each preceded by a paragraph of prose, describing the situation at the time in great detail, were exactly the same in format as the storytelling and ballad singing of today, where every time a section is sung, the strings are stopped and dialogue or expression is inserted. This is then, Ankang, is the Southern opera legacy of Wen Tianxiang, I believe. As for the word Tanhuang, it is actually the error of Taihuang. In the Complete Works of Wenshan, there is proof of this. The sea ship he took from Tongzhou was the Sanjiang ship from Taizhou, and when he landed from the sea ship to the shore of Taiwan, he first stayed at Zhang Zhezai's house, falsely claiming to be surnamed Liu. When he passed Huangyan into the territory of Tiantai, he restored his original name. Then the poems of records must be announced in Tiantai and Huangyan, then spread at once, and become eternal. The survivors of the Southern Song Dynasty used it to praise the loyalty and righteousness of Xinguo, just like the string music of Wucheng. Extended to other similar past history, it can not be mentioned in the same breath with the blind words of three strings alone. Since it is the legacy of Southern Song music, not Yuan music, it is called Zhongyuan rhyme after the fall of the country. Some say that Ankang is the legacy of the Tang Dynasty. If so, then it is better to trace back to the Jin Dynasty, with Xie An of Dongshan silk and bamboo and Ji Kang of the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove as its distant ancestors, wouldn't it be wonderful? There are originally seven people in the Ankang Gathering of our Hangzhou, and the one who plays the three-stringed instrument is usually in the first seat, which is the great Ruan of the Seven Sages. Therefore, I think the three-stringed instrument is actually a Ruan. The Japanese Shamisen is also a Ruan, but its circulation in the world. (To be continued)</p>
