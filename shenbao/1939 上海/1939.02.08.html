<h3>張伯倫聲明助法之前瞻</h3>
<p>「侵略必向弱處伸張，和平端賴武力保障，」</p>
<p>此實充滿血腥，暴露獸性之哲學，亦背棄天理，乖違人道之理論；宜爲智慧之思想家所菲薄，爲醇厚之道德家所深惡痛絕。顧乃一般人類之文明程度，經久而絕不長進，長此滯留於現階段之中而爲此理論所支配。漠視此理論者，輒至身受其殃；以此理論衡量一切現實問題者，幾何百無一失。夫知行之矛盾至於斯極，凡吾圓顱方趾之倫，居常猶以理智動物自居，不大可哂耶！遠者不必論·中國久於眈眈虎視之下，但以爲國聯盟的與九國公的可爲保障，遂爲異族所蹂躪；此以漠視血腥哲學而遭殃者也。義大利涉大海越沙漠而取阿比西尼亞，德意志割捷克而併奧地利，此侵向弱處例之允著者也。全能國以民治國多黨好訟貪財怯戰爲弱，德義軸心以英法結合鬆懈爲弱，義國以法國出生率退减爲弱，於是揎拳攘臂，霍霍磨刀，要索之不已。誠使民治諸國萎靡如故，散漫如故，迷信諾言，迷信口舌外交如故，則非俯首聽命，惟有倉惶應戰而已，世界大局未可知也。猶幸慕尼黑敎室中之一課，現身說法，面命耳提，於是血腥哲學，註脚如鐵，世運乃開始其轉變矣。</p>
<p>轉變何由？曰各國各制其空前之軍費預算也·美國爲英法趕造大量軍用飛機也，法國表示不讓寸土之决心也，蘇聯表示尊重法蘇協定也，羅斯福氏表示必助民治國也；及至隔昨，英國首相溫和長老張伯倫氏，在彼下議院，又作簡單明暸堅决有力之聲明日·英國將不問法國所受威脅來自何方，必以全力赴之也。如此聲明者，不僅为七十老翁之生平創作，亦歐洲大戰後，國際政史所應大書特書而為劃時代之一頁也。前乎此者；英法雙方，或相感應，或相默契，或有成的，兩國之間蓋有生存收關之共通利害，故其關係爲不可分；顧有人焉，以爲英法不若是之密切，輒謀自外交上有以離間之。前乎此者：英法不備戰，戰必偕進；顧有人焉，猶以爲戰爲法國，英必不爲法國而戰；故自外交上示好於英以尼英之袒法，而在軍事上以法國為單獨之作戰對象。前乎此者：或防戰爭綿延，英國終或助法，顧於戰爭爆發之初期，英必矜持，此在外交上或猶有運用餘地；而在戰略上，要在一舉擊法而潰之。及張伯倫首相聲明如隔昨，於是而外交上軍事上分野畫然，無復蹊徑可圖；而英法陣綫之自此鞏固，抑且强化，於是而歐陸風雲變色，不復容片面張揚；揆之血腥哲學，和平增一保障矣。</p>
<p>自此之後，不戰則已，戰必大戰，此在世人早已同鑒，而在全能國家則於志高氣盛之餘，至是而始能體認，亦至是而始肯體認者也。惟其然，故既往之若干時日，以外交部之工作爲重，所務爲縱橫椑闔，乘除友敵；在今後之若干時日，以參謀部之工作為重，所務為運籌帷幄，估計盈虛。論盈虛，其範圍而限於法義，則兵力物力人事形勢，各有短長；其範圍而爲德義對英法，或更擴大之，則全部改觀，至少可以斷言德義不若英法之能耐久，况德意志固不欲戰乎！</p>
<p>大勢若斯，誰下孤注？謂猶不免於一戰者，竊所不信。抑尙有不可知者焉：獨裁政權，以立功立威爲本，此即黷武之主要因素，是可虞者一。義大利瀕熱帶，民族性重感情而躁進，况爲多年好大喜功，旁若無人之宣傳所煆鍊；此可虞者二。西班牙內戰，以義大利之助力，勝負漸分，前綫推進，將及法國邊境；可能的意外，既所難防，計畫的啓釁，亦在意中；此可虞者三。去年九月，德國於捷克之出奇制勝，義大利固亦劍及履及，所耗不資，殆有約焉，德須報德；此可虞者四。夫可虞者若此，而不可戰者如彼；是又視墨索里尼氏將如何揮其世界的政治家之大手腕,制止所可虞，避免孤注一擲之作戰，而取得榮譽之成就於和平中乎！</p>

<h3>蘇聯運用外交策略　圖締結黑海公約　拉攏羅土希保四國參加　樹立集體安全阻德東進</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）此間外交界盛傳蘇聯外交當局擬發起締結黑海公約、以黑海沿岸之國家卽羅馬尼亞·土耳其·蘇聯等三國為基礎、此外、希臘雖不在黑海沿岸、亦當邀約參加、保加利亞對于羅馬尼亞、原抱有「恢復故土」的願望、今後倘因黑海公約之成立、而使保國此項願望較有實現之可能、則該國自亦樂于加入、特該國所抱願望、必須减低至最小限度耳、近聞蘇聯外交當局正在進行試探、俾可明瞭此項計劃有無實現之望、大抵蘇聯政府主張以黑海為中心、樹立集體安全制度、藉以阻止德國再事束進、至蘇聯政府已否向關係各國提出此項建議、則尙未了然云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法合作宣言　羅馬感覺不安　認有軍事同盟性質　析林方面保持緘默</h3>
<p>（羅馬）英相張伯倫在下院所發關於英法合作之言論、已使義國政界為之震動、以為此次張伯倫對於英法條約之關係有較前更為明顯之表示、某方面謂張伯倫此言、等於英法軍事同盟之宜布、與德兀首希特勒所宣布德義間之關係、有同等束縛之力量云、許多政治觀察家認英相此次言論、已打破義國所抱英國對法從未予以軍事援助的保證之信念、義國人士以為法總理達拉第在慕尼黑協定成立後、曾謂英國予以此種担保、當為張伯倫所拒絕、但今則達拉第之運動已獲成功矣、義國官塲不願發表批評、惟謂義國天然的願望、並不危害任何國之軍　利益云、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）今晨此間各報皆著社論，極力欲减少英相張伯倫昨在下院發表英法兩國牽入戰爭時互相作軍事援助宣言之價値、據稱、英　因法國時以壓力相加、故作此言以答之、其意義與前所發之言論殊無差別云、各報又因英相所言者為牽涉英法兩國之戰爭而非泛言戰爭、故對於此點、尤竭力發揮、（七日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）此間對於英相張伯倫在下院所發關於英法合作之言論、多守緘默、不置批評、某發言人吿路透記者、英相此言、並不新頴、當捷克局勢吃緊時、英相曾封法國作同樣之擔保、今後各事、視張伯倫此言可否使法國態度轉强而定、如法國態度因此强硬、則現有緊張、勢將增甚云、又有批評家謂張伯倫、對法之擔保、與德國給予義國之担保相似云（七日路透電）</p>

<p>泰縣特訊、自豫黃南决、合淮而下、裏下河一帶、如興·東·鹽·阜·江·泰·高·寳·淮等縣、無不大受其苦、上述各縣紳書、因時屆冬令、而下河積潦、仍未退動、若不設法斷黃水來源、及疏浚范公堤以東入海水道、則瞬屆桃汛、整個蘇北、勢必陸沈其半、經聯名電請國府及有關各部院會　江蘇省政府一再呼籲、蘇省府亦深知上游之流不截、入海河不疏、江北浩刦、勢難幸免、迭經據情轉呈中央、請予設法堵閉已决之河南中牟趙口、鄭縣花園口、以絕來源、一面組織疏浚裏下河入海水道工程委員會於東台、并聘韓國鈞為主任委員、幷在東台召集第一次常會、議决疏浚工程計劃、</p>
<p>施工程序計分三期</p>
<p>對於施工程序亦已商定、查范堤以東、舊有五大港、近年闢川東港、一名行船港、共六港、以射陽河洩水為最通暢、新洋港鬥龍港次之、王家港竹港川東港又次之、以上六港、現正行水、碍難截壩大挑、惟有酌疏支渠、以期多洩一立方公尺之水量、即可减少一立方公尺之水患、至施工程序、約分三期、視經費之多寡、以為先後、而尤以第一期為最急要曰八百文引河及其上流之第二卯酉河、出王家港、曰第四卯酉河、出矢晚港、所以引鬥龍港之水、分途歸海者也、鬥龍居五大港之中部、左納羣支、幹流多曲、難于翕受、宜謀分减、或須裁灣使其迅直、此外曰西潮河、所以引伍佑串塲河之水、合於射陽尾閭歸海者也、串塲為入海水道承轉之關鍵、宜多闢途徑、使其不壅、是為第一期必辦之工、其二三兩期各工、具載計劃書中、統計工費、約在百萬元以上、第一期亦需四十餘萬元、論其效用、如果黃水不來、郵壩堵閉、下河積水、自可漸减、民田涸出、不誤春耕、</p>
<p>中央撥款補助疏浚</p>
<p>蘇省府以黃河之花圜趙口兩處潰决段、旣奉中央電令、因特殊關係、無法堵口、今後黃河大溜起從此改道、奪淮入蘇、導淮下流之入海段已多坍塌、且流沙又將河牀淤高、黃流迥旋裹下河一帶、未能暢洩入海、致高寳淮揚各縣、洪水氾濫、災情慘重、韓主席以旣不能治本、乃先治標、準備疏浚裹下河入海水道工程、省府前電國府經濟部、請補助工費十萬元、以便着手進行、昨已接到部長翁文灝漾（二十三日）電、謂堵塞黃河决口案、前由本部提請行政院會議公决及賣省府微　　併案討論、議决疏浚入海水　工程、由經濟部查核、酌予補助　因、查該項疏浚工程、事關切要、奉令前因、自應照撥十萬元、以資補助、除呈復外、將電請派員携同印領來部洽領、</p>

<h3>滬津秦膠東各關稅收　截一萬五千萬　擅自减低稅率有處日本　關稅担保各債基金無着</h3>
<p>自中日戰事發生之後、華北暨上海等處、不幸先後淪為戰區、戰區以內各海關被日攫奪後、稅收被迫改存日商正金銀行、並擅自减低日貨進口稅、以利傾銷將日本需要士貨出口稅則减低、以利輸日、各關去年稅收共一萬五千八百九十六萬元、除江海關解過一百十八萬元外、迄未照解與政府、致關稅及關餘担保各內外價基金無着、茲誌詳情如下、</p>

<h3>日非法栓查扣留外輪　各領曾提抗議</h3>
<p>日海軍竟謂檢查並無不合　係防止華輪懸掛外旗庇蔭</p>
<p>新聲社云、行駛我國沿海及長江下游之外輪、時遭日艦之非法檢查及動輙加以扣留、致使外輪蒙受重大之損失、曾經被扣之各外輸、其各該國駐滬領事、向日當局提出抗議、惟據日海軍當局答覆、關於檢查懸掛第三國國旗之船隻問題、此等檢查、並非一件不尋常而視作重大之事件、日方對於懸掛外國旗幟之船隻、加以檢查、似並不為過、渠等深信、自戰後所有中國華商船隻、均以懸掛外旗為庇蔭、如最近被日海軍扣留於廈門之懸掛匈牙利國旗之愛大輸、其是否屬於匈牙利所有、殊可研究、</p>
<p>大陸報云</p>
<p>匈牙利木質商輸阿達號、重一百三十七噸、昨（六日）晚仍被日海軍覊留於廈門港中某碼頭、據日海軍發言人昨晚聲稱、阿達輸留泊該地、以待澈底調查其船主之手續吿畢、據向本埠航運界探悉、</p>
<p>阿達船長</p>
<p>挪威人史汀及華籍船員三四十人、仍留輪上、該輪之本埠代理處、昨日午後答覆問話、否認輸上載有搭客、並切實聲明僅得運貨之特許、該輸原名通利（譯音）、一九三五年造於溫州、去年十月二十七日、由匈牙利人柯莫爾承購、裝置馬達後、即歸</p>
<p>新主經營</p>
<p>云、某記者叩諸發言人云、阿達輸於是日易主、而由第三國人民經營、則合乎日海軍之條例乎、發言人答稱、日海軍對此事件、將視易主與其他因素之眞實性而决定態度、曾傳聞華人所有之帆船與其他船隻、懸掛第三國旗幟、是以日海軍保留調查此等船隻的</p>
<p>身份之權</p>
<p>若確定船主完全為外人、則立卽開釋、發言人復答覆問話云、日方當局扣留任何外國船隻、而調查其船主、未有要求賠償其時間等損失者、目前扣留阿達號與其他船隻、並無特殊意義、亦非表示「改變政策」、僅一貫日海軍於數月前對中國船隻所發宣言中闡明之「固定政策」云、</p>
<h3>上海英駐軍　司令易人</h3>
<p>路透社七日倫敦電、陸軍部宣佈、已任命現駐巴力斯坦之西蒙斯大佐、自六月五日起為駐上海英軍司令、</p>

<h3>問題複雜解决需時　虹口尙難開放</h3>
<p>盛傳百老匯路開放之說　經調查後證明並非事實</p>
<p>開放虹口問題、經工部局與日本方面談判年餘、迄無結果、昨日忽盛傳虹口東百老匯路一帶區域、將於廢曆新年正式開放、准許居民可以自由遷入居住等語、經記者向工部局方面輾轉探詢、得悉此項傳說、並非事實、虹口正式開放一節、事實上尙嫌過早、至於雙方談判、目前雖仍在順利進行之中、但亦並無任何切實决定、工部局方面認為此事複雜、困難甚多、欲求迎刃而解、殊需時日、</p>
<h3>日人來滬謀生　空懷奢望</h3>
<p>結果獲得職業甚少　居留民會應付為</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、據日方消息、僅携旅費而自日本來滬覓求職業之日人、刻方發覺難以償願、蓋受雇者僅佔十分之三、若輩謀職者、於軟項將罄時、不得不向日本居留民恊會之職業介紹部申請、故該部邇來因以異常忙碌、據該部發表數字、去年十二月份至該部申請者有男子二九六人、女子六八人、得業者僅男子一〇二人、女子八人、一月份計男子二二八人、女子四四人、得業者僅男子八十五人、女子十八人、該部所辦理之各項職業中、以汽車夫·舌人·店員·司　·看護·電話接綫女生·厨司、等為最多、</p>

<h3>市商會電請准許　生漆運滬</h3>
<p>滬商業向集中租界　生漆亦非資日物品</p>
<p>浙閩等海關奉令查禁桐油·木材·棉花·生漆·等運滬後、各地商會及各業公會、會分電請求她禁、滬市生漆等業前會派員赴內地採辦土貨轉運來滬、近因海關有禁運之令、未能放行、今生漆業公會特函報上海市商會、新聲社記者昨向關係方面探悉、上海市商會以滬市商業、向集中於租界區域、自國軍西撤後、在南市閘北之商業、可以設法搬遷者、亦均先後移至兩租界安全區營業、生漆為居民日用器具塗飾所必需、亦非資日物品、特轉電經濟部、咨商財政部飭海關騐放、以維商品流通、</p>
<h3>上川路曹家路口　日駐軍遭覆滅</h3>
<p>華軍夜襲割斷軍用話綫　日軍僅二三名乘間兔脫</p>
<p>浦東上川鐵路綫之曹家路口與金家橋兩鎭、前晚九時許、中日軍發生劇烈戰事、曹家路口一役、交鋒允烈、砲聲隆隆、達兩小時之久、日守鎭兵士二十餘名、僅有兩三名脫逃生還、當塲擊斃者六七名、</p>
<p>餘均被俘　幾全部覆滅、偽「警」四名、亦飮彈而死，華軍迭成去歲八一三紀念及國慶紀念以來第一次最光榮之勝利、是晚九時、華軍一百餘名、以輕捷之夜行軍、突然出現於曹家路口鎭四週、先將日軍用電話綫割斷、分東西兩路、進至曹鎭、包圍車站附近之</p>
<p>日軍據點　該鎭在日軍眼光中、較為重要、故常川派有陸軍二十餘名、畫夜駐守、其時有哨兵數名、伏處於沙袋防禦物內、餘均睡臥、華軍黑暗中、機槍密集射來、日哨兵急切還擊、其餘日兵、由夢中驚醒、倉惶起身應戰、但華軍四面重重包圍、日軍乃拖出小鋼砲、視為憑藉利器、頻頻開放示威、一時</p>
<p>砲聲隆隆　驚動遠近、偽「警」八名、（該處偽「警」、已經發槍）、亦被迫作戰、交鋒約兩小時、擊斃日軍七八名、偽「警」四名、日軍因電話斷絕、後援無人、戰至聲嘶力竭、華軍奮勇衝進日軍據點、當塲有受傷日兵十四名、一同被俘、僅有兩三名未受傷者、被脫去軍服、乘間逃逸、華軍獲得</p>
<p>重大勝利　後、將日方工事破壞、押同俘虜凱旋引退、同時金家橋方面、亦於九時許、有遊擊隊數十人、襲擊該鎭、駐在金鎭之日兵、僅有八名、當塲擊斃一名、餘均逃回沿浦邊高廟鎭、華軍並未窮追、旋即退去、昨晨天明後、日軍川沙植弘本隊部、頓起大恐慌、但因川城情勢緊張、所駐日兵、不足百人、無法抽調、致曹鎭</p>
<p>無兵駐守　急請南黃浦之南碼頭日警備隊小川部隊七十人中、勉强調出二十人、携帶小鋼砲兩尊、機槍數架、搭乘小輪、於上午十一時、運抵高廟渡口登岸、再搭上川車赴曹家路口接防、故昨日上川路形勢緊張、往日每班客車、至少有搭客二三百人、上下行均有此數、但昨日每班僅有二三十人、全日營業不及平日十分之一</p>
<h3>粉廠及雜糧商　購洋麥十萬噸　分批運滬第三批昨換埠　王月底以前可完全運竣</h3>
<p>上海為全國麵粉業之中心、不啻為全國小麥薈集之區、戰後我國政府禁止小麥運滬、戰區小麥、受日統制、運滬困難、租界內之麵粉廠、因原料缺乏、不得不向國外訂購、總約十萬噸、分批運滬、茲志詳情如下、</p>
<p>小麥缺乏　麵粉廠為小麥之　大主顧、故上海廠家所用之小麥、除由交易機關經手介紹購進者外、頗多直接採辦　、即在各產麥區域、設立辦麥處採辦小麥、戰後我國政府禁止小麥出口、及轉口至淪陷區域、於是浙江·江西·湖南·福建·等省小麥、無法運滬、華北及上海四郊戰區小麥、受日統制、廠商採辦困難、以致租界以內各麵粉廠、原料發牛缺乏恐慌、所有製粉　、不能完全開工製造、</p>
<p>訂購洋麥　上海福新·阜新·等麵粉廠、及經營小麥之雜糧行、不得已向國外訂購洋麥、總數約十萬噸、委託達孚洋行等辦理、分批由美裝輪運滬、第一批計八千三百五十三噸、裝力琪萊輪（Rugeley）、已於上月底抵滬、第二批計七千七百五十噸、裝哈梅脫力斯號（Harmatris）已於二月五日抵滬、第三批八千三百八十三噸、裝勒萊輪（Riler）、已於昨日抵滬、停泊責浦江第十四號及十五號浮筒、　分批裝輪　第一·二·三·批洋麥、已抵滬者、合計二萬四千四百八十六噸，第四批八千八百九十三噸、裝勒瑞輸（JantZe）、預定二月底抵滬、聞十萬噸洋麥、共分十批至十二批運滬、大約五月底以前、可完全抵達、是項洋麥、大都係供給租界內福新阜新等麵粉廠製粉之用、實為戰後廠商訂購洋麥之第一聲、</p>

<h3>荳米業公會　竭力穩定米價　日方鉅量收買存底日减　兩租界當局均頗為重視</h3>
<p>戰區內國米、受華北商人勾結日方鉅量收買、運滬裝日輪私自出口、以致戰區產地、存底日减、米價為之抬高、滬市民食、幸存貨充足、暫時不致缺乏恐慌、惟長此以往、勢將蒙受影響、昨向米業市塲探悉、連日因到貨稀少且廢歷年關、轉瞬將屆、致滬市米價步漲、頭號白米、已漲至十二元八角、荳米業公會、已飭市塲管理委員會、竭力穩定米價、並設法疏通來源、同時公共租界工部局、及法租界公董局、對滬市米價、以事關民食、甚為重視、派員調查界內存米、以免發生前年底之同樣不幸事件、</p>

<h3>日財政困窘　又將增發約幣　續發三萬萬或五萬萬元　增加準備金有劇烈爭辯</h3>
<p>大陸報云、據日本紀事報載稱、對日本銀行法續加修正之建議、卽將向本屆國會提出是項新議案乃欲授權日本銀行、續行增發紙幣日金三萬萬或五萬萬圓、查上屆國會中已將限制額自十萬萬圓增至十七萬萬圓、因有金準備八萬零一百萬圓、故該行可</p>
<p>發行紙幣　達二十五萬萬圓、而不繳付特別稅、但日本於去年七月成立外匯項目、已自金準備中提出三萬萬元、故今日該行不繳稅而發行之紙幣、最高額為二十二萬萬元、至去年底發出紙幣、已逾限六萬萬元、自本年初起、日本銀行所發紙幣迅予收回、但</p>
<p>鑒於軍費　續有增加、衆信貨幣流通額將漸增高、故財政當局認為有增加担保準備金限度之必要、對於增加數額、各方意見分歧若干方面、以為準備金已减少三萬萬元、故主張準備金與紙幣作等量之增加、而他方面則堅持</p>
<p>作實質上　之增加、財政當局反對任何劇烈之增加、以其易於促成通貨膨脹、一般人之意見、則為規定增加五萬萬元、果爾、則新限制額將為二十二萬萬元、或連金準備合計為二十七萬萬元、</p>

<h3>金融　獲利出籠者甚踴躍　現金價漲後又回頭</h3>
<p>是高曾達二零六五元　成交有一千二百餘兩</p>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、起伏依然不定、大致情勢則先堅而後轉疲、初因上日之餘勢未息、且聞外滙續緊、加以初開證券稱買意甚濃、致抬高至二千零六十五元開盤、幾打破去年十一月廿八日之二千零六十八元最高峯、後以各錢兌業忽代客帮手中握有實資者、傾向出籠、且證券帮亦反進為出、故一時頓感供過於求、價乃忽向下游、此後難某錢兌業突來復進、及某金號續來猛購、然人心因聞滙豐銀行對於英金暗盤八辨士一二五為維持債價、故獲利出籠者頗不乏人、且證券帮費風甚濃、致價欲漲無力、結果則僅續升三元、唯中送仍多盤旋、但尙無過大曲折、交易尙旺、一千二百四十兩、銀樓飾金因上午烚赤初聞甚堅、故亦掛大一元、海關金暨中英純金等續向下降、</p>
<p>烚赤聞盤見新高價</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初承上日餘勢、且外滙亦報緊軟、故人心益加堅硬、進者喊二千零六十五元買進、有少數售者喊七十元賣出、其時銀樓帮忽來拋塞、售予證券帮五十兩、二千零六十五九為開盤價、較上日做高十一元、開後雖外滙續報軟化、然獲利出籠者頗湧、市價遂吿鬆疲、首見某錢兌業代客帮脫售、吐予某金號七十兩、價六十元、又售予錢兌業暨證券帮及銀樓帮各五十兩、價均六十元、繼之另一錢兌業亦代本地帮出籠、售予命號及同業各五十兩、價則相同、此後進者更缺、故價遂破入六十元關內、金號售予錢兌業廿兩、及錢兌業互做五十兩、價均五十六元、其時某金號又來吸收、故價遂逐步回升、某金號進證券帮五十兩、價五十八元、錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價五十九元、某金號又進錢兌業百兩、價五十八元、後錢兌業又售予銀樓帮五十兩、價五十七元、另一錢兌業進銀摟帮五十兩、價五十九元、最後金號進錢兌業五十兩、價五十八元五角、為午收價、午後因聞外滙已止緊回硬、滙豐銀行對於英金八辨士一二五為維持價、後人心稍向下游、然某錢兌業忽又大量復進、幸證劵帮與銀樓帮及錢兌業供塞尙湧、致鮮變化、某錢兌業進同業五十兩、價五十七元、繼之又猛進二百餘兩、價五十七元及五十六元、均由證券帮聲銀樓都供給、後證券帮又售予某錢兌業五十兩、價五十五元五角、為最低價、此後因金號續來吸收、故價止跌步高、金號進同業五十兩、價五十七元、最後某錢兌業又進同業五十兩、價仍二千零五十七元、為晚收價、較上日軋漲三元、全天九元五角差度、現金號之本牌金售出價二千零六十五元、收進二千零五十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、均無做開、</p>
<p>飾金高至二零九元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、初均未更、迨至九時四十二分、因烚赤衝出六十元關、故亦隨之掛大一元、大同行老慶雲等改懸二百零九元、新同行亦改懸二百零七元、收進二百零一元、</p>
<p>純余續縮一便士半</p>
<p>六日倫敦電、英純金每盎司續縮一辨士半、計退達七鎊八先令五辨士半、致中央銀行之中國純金收買價亦降低至一千二百十一元九角、掛牌海關金亦小二厘、計二元三角九分四厘、上海標準標金價亦隨跌一元、計一千二百零七元四角、</p>
<h3>日票旺銷　外帶需要猶殷　抵制徒託空言</h3>
<p>昨日英純金續跌一辨士半、英美滙兌升六八七五、外滙仍因華北需要旺盛、銀行供給未暢、市價續呈頹勢、烚赤開盤堅昂、嗣金號銀樓業等、出籠頻仍、市價漸漸下跌、後復趁低價吸納、冉冉上漲、收盤終昂、觀察前途、金價尙有驚駭波濤、外幣各金鎊金票、出籠甚盛、惟殷富搜羅未懈、交易旺盛、日金票在市使用、為數頗鉅、聞有抵制使用以示報復說、業中人昏庸者多、利之所在、趨之若騖、此說想亦有愛國心腸者閒談資料耳、公會交易尙盛、利通出永盛進美金票、二百元、承泰出同　進英金票一百鎊、又出三泰進英金票一百鎊、晋大出鴻昌進英金鎊一百個、昨日市價、英金鎊升二角五分，英金票升二角一分、美金票升二分、香港票升七厘、法郎票升五毫、新加坡票荷蘭票各升二分、坎拿大票升二分，斐列濱票升三分半、義大利票降一分僅美金鎊安南票羅比票德金票澳金票、暹暹票未更、</p>
<h3>外滙變化仍巨　結款浩繁外行湧塞　由緊而鬆英緊美平</h3>
<p>滙市昨以各大油洋行等結款殷繁、兼之日銀行界續來活動吸收、加以猶太商喬直甫、暨華商紗花帮亦驟起買結、致潛勢頗緊、計英金一度退為八辨士一二五、美匯亦曾軟至十五元八四三七五、然卒以外銀行等競相湧塞、故結果英緊〇三一二五、美則無軒輊、唯中途變化仍巨、成交亦仍暢旺港滙因錢兌業賣意頗淡、且各外銀行吸胃頗健、市况續縮三七五、</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條近遠均平紐約銀價仍無更動、倫敦生金續縮一辨士半、匯兌英對美大五厘六、對法長十生丁、對滬縮〇六二五、美對英長五六二五、對法升二五、對滬降一角九分、中央掛牌各匯呆定如故、銀行早開、現貨賣價、英滙八辦士一七一八七五、美滙十五元九三七五、較前收英平美硬〇三一二五、開後華商紗花帮首先吸進滙豐英金八辦士一七一八七五、繼猶太商喬直甫與亞細亞結進滙豐華比英金八辦士一五六二五、縮至一四〇六二五、致潛勢步軟、匯豐掛脾揭曉未更、及白銀平衡稅揭曉、亦無升降、此後某洋行及日銀行等購結匯豐美行華比美滙十五元九三七五、緊至九〇六二五、機而油洋行德士古暨美孚亦競相吸進有利美行美匯僅十五兀八七五、叉緊至十五元八四三七五、後某洋行父吸進滙豐英金祇八辨士一二五、是以過程頗緊、最後錢兌業售予安達荷蘭港滙五十四元半與六二五、於是趨勢漸平、</p>
<p>後市革洋行又來吸進有利麥加利英金八辦士一二五、後以外銀行供意尙濃、加之購結者轉稀、致潛勢稍見回鬆、匯豐售予洋行英金八辦士一四〇六二五、繼之荷蘭美行亦塞予洋行美匯十五元八七五、而港匯因外銀行進意頗强、且錢兌業不肯廉售、故價稍貴、華義吃進錢兌業港滙五十四元三七五、迨晚收銀行賣價英滙八辦士一四〇六二五、美滙十五元九〇六二五、結果比前收、英縮〇三一二五、美則無榮辱、港滙縮緊三七五、茲將一天做開交易錄後、</p>

<p>昨日市上經過情形、大都沉悶、不脫盤旋趨疲狀態、初有二十號代大戶補空、天生號亦有買進、市氣似尙堅强、後因同康號賣出較湧、稍受挫折、午收結果、高低互見、而人心帶軟、午後市氣更餒、市上祇信豐永稍有補空、賣出方面、則七號三十五號以及潤利號、其陣容自佔優勢，市價乃立脚不定、而轉趨疲落、廢曆歲闌交易亦無多日、人心大都觀望、昨日市價結果一致回鬆四五角、成交總數約計七八十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<p>紗市始漲繼疲、趨勢緊俏、良以實需尙稱不弱、但比上日為减少、故漲勢過激時、有人獲利者又來出檔、一時籌碼略鬆、市聲即見下降、二十支雙馬高價復見四百零六元、與一月十五日之頂峯價碰頭、因此塵浮之多頭趁機出籠而回落、同時廠方因價高紛紛開售、終日而不間斷、查新生紗廠係新創之廠、紗綫錠約計一萬數千枚、昨日在紗業公會上大量開出一千包外、價格三百九十元、三四月期、承受者每包付定洋三十元、始行收進三萬元定銀於此一來、多方心亂陡鬆一步、然據市塲言、吳某突來收進廿支雙馬現紗有數百包、市况復定、又謂該戶陸續吸收棉紗約有六千包、都係墊銀上棧、獲利殊巨、查其購進價格、在三百十八元時、開始抱進、一直收買至目前為止照此述之、盈利當不在少數也、</p>
<p>現紗市塲晨開人氣非常熱烈、因上日南華一隅需要頻繁、人心堅挺、現貨商一致看好面、雙馬開盤即跳二元、為四百零六元、毛盤做過零七元、同業成交極熱鬧、少頃聞兩日各廠開出額子約計二三千包之巨、市塲人心壓平一些、雙馬售價突然下挫、最低價至四百零三元、旋以吳某委託他人突來收買、市價徐徐回起至四百零三元半收盤、查上午成交統計一千五百七十八包、上日成交二百四十五包、合計一千八百二十三包、行情二十支雙馬價比上日跌一元半、牧羊漲三元半、天女漲五角、雙地球漲二元半、特金城平、十支粗紗漲三四元、茲將各帮買去額量列左、</p>
<p>前日午收成交補錄如左</p>
<p>日紗市塲生間呆木如故、行情與上日無甚軒輊、下月份皮球交易因上次擠軋後、大家咸具戒心、不敢嘗試、完全入於停頓狀態中、二十支水月現紗價為三百二十九元、二十支藍鳳現紗價為三百二十三元半云、</p>
<h3>棉花交易愈淸淡</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市因各同業俱以華盛頓貸款棉出售問題之未能解决、均抱靜觀狀態、故棉市殊為呆滯、昨紐約初漲、因海外棉價良好、因之引起同業略有小額交易、後有若干南方戶套賣、及紐輿綸斯帮之售出、收盤時棉價回疲、較之日前跌一二磅音、印度連同預測跌一羅比、埃及跌十六磅音、昨日滙兌父縮、折合法幣、計美棉及巴西棉每担漲六角、印棉漲五角、埃及跌四角、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、年內恐無多量交易、昨日祇有安達訂購印棉白洛區二百包、合送廠價為七十二元、此棉可紡二十四支之用、日廠方面亦祗有公大進巴西棉三百包、茲將昨日棉價列後、</p>
<p>本棉生意愈形沉悶、各方預備結束　歲、因此交易完全入於停頓狀態中、廠方心思尤形渙散、市面絕無精彩可言、市象不出於呆木而穩定、生意一起、市續當漲、近日外滙緊縮、外棉合價稍昂、蘇北一路來源尙稱小弱、碼頭到貨、計通花二千七百八十九包、北沙來一百五十件、白茆來二百二十件、茲將現棉成交錄左、</p>
<h3>疋頭　海防積貨過多　川滇少辦　東疋交易寥落</h3>
<p>國布白貨細布微堅、細斜·粗布均趨牛定、永安廠大鵬細布晨市十二元六角半、午後漲五分、開十二元七角、粵帮及本街批發號國戶購進大鵬·富貴各牌一百數十件、粗布·粗斜僅有零星交易、色布·呢絨·嗶嘰閩帮購進五六十件、川·滇·汕各帮新添辦亦已稀少、春令花色布疋·細布·細科成交一百餘件、進胃已弱、聞因海防積貨過多、且年內船期已僅一班、故意存觀望云、</p>
<p>東布細布·細斜現貨銷塲、日漸淡薄、故昨日各牌售盤、俱無榮辱、本客交易寥若晨星、但期貨開價、逐步上騰、蓋因同業心思趨高、三四月份進胃甚旺、雖與現貨每疋聲高三角外、而仍無畏縮之態、東棉伊藤兩行、昨繼續訂開龍頭·喇叭等細布千件左右、龍頭遠月期售盤為十二元一角至一角半、喇叭童竟售至十一元八角半至九角、</p>
<h3>絲茶　絲經漲風盛　外銷冷落</h3>
<p>國外絲市、漲風未已、昨紐約近期漲三分、遠期漲五分、其他中日生絲一致激漲一分、橫濱現貨晨市九四〇元、下午九五〇元、遠期九一七元、下午九一〇元、里昂絲市、中日生絲各漲一·五〇法郎至二·五〇法郎不等、</p>
<p>本埠絲交、因漲風太熾、成交較少、洋行方面、法莊寂靜、美莊頗有購意、白廠經七八分、昨廠商討價一五二〇元、洋行可能吸進之行市、為一五〇〇元平頭、惜因用戶RR已售開一五〇〇元新盤、故照加洋行開銷計算、七八分市價須在　五二〇—四〇元間、故昨外銷暫形淸緊、輯里絲仍以內銷為旺、總觀各種生絲、在二月中旬、似在日益挺進中、甚少下落可能、</p>
<p>昨有湖絲百零六件、及茶葉四十一噸、運往歐洲、</p>
<h3>糧食　粉市醖釀中　麥呈明定暗鬆</h3>
<p>粉市廠盤續無變動、客路銷塲、仍以南帮為活、北帮次之、各廠以目下現粉不充、售出之貨尙未解淸、洋麥雖有運到、尙在起卸、故廠方並無貶售之意、僅買方意在擯小耳、結果二號粉仍守四元八角原盤、由南北兩帮合辦一萬五六千包、本街零枇亦有八千餘包、市面猶在醖釀中、</p>
<p>麥市已入明定暗鬆之象、查來源不多、貨方以成本高昂、一味堅執、而廠方則以前定洋麥、共有九船之多、除最近新到兩船外、本月二十左右、尙有一船可到、其餘尙有五船、均須於三月間睦續運滬、是以對於國麥需要、更見淡薄、阜豐廠隻包未辦、福新廠祇應酬江北麥二百包、價仍為六元六角、雖未傾跌、而大局恐難久穩、滬埠麥市、將被洋麥侵奪殆盡矣、</p>
<h3>杜米客秈　囤戶續有進辦</h3>
<p>昨國米來源、共到河下二號、車輪包子亦僅二三千包、內八百包自白茆來、游浦來一千一百包、早市開手、形勢尙懈、及後來源稀少、人心頓堅、而本街銷塲復見活潑、囤戶相繼進取、售方乘機喚高、當時情形頗屬混沌、所以結果、市面雖屬帶緊、而厚薄粳則頗有參差、加起五分至一角不一、杜洋尖埠尖供求相仿、變兀去路雖似不暢、而貨主大都以貨稀、堅持扳高、致成定局、暗中增起一角、</p>
<p>客秈本街零戶店囤納　續濃、全日成交數仍有二千包左右、市面又見帶緊五六分、午市本尖飛騰之際、客秈售價亦曾號高角外，惟新有車運一批抵申、而浮戶散客又多趁高求脫、因此行情未克再度飛升、南京特高秈向在扳佾中、高貨開十一元，高蕪秈未開、大市貨十元〇五角至九元八九角不一、</p>
<h3>雜糧　黃豆實銷尙可　生仁黃豆續有出口</h3>
<p>近日雜糧市塲、做開之交易雖少、但大都均係實銷、月需要殷切、故市氣格外良好、昨計本街及厦門帮辦去崇明沙黃六百餘包行情再漲五六分、為七元七角半至七元六角、又本街成交吳江揀蠶五十包、價六元一角二分、及崇明沙赤四包、價六元七角半、以上兩種雖形修削，但就貨品相較、尙居擾越之地位云、</p>
<p>昨豆子出口、計運孟買二百四十九噸、運可倫布二十一噸、運吉打（新加坡）四十六噸、</p>
<p>又昨有二十五噸生仁運哈維（法國）、又進口則有生仁八百五十包及花生二百七十包、自威海衛來、</p>
<h3>糖市　荷粗車白　現貨軋缺</h3>
<p>昨洋糖以結束在即、不售者已上關棧、故現貨至為軋缺、致成畸形之聚勢、公會劃盤二四荷粗白、本棧貨又升五分、為二十四元二角、轉口貨十六元、無出戶、後呌十六元二角、太古車白B　西棧交貨又升二角半、以二十三元七角成交、後呌九角、號盤有潮帮開出綿赤百餘包、佳泰牌為十五元三角、次十四元七角、半南靑八十包、十三元四角、海南赤百數包、十二元</p>
<h3>南北貨　泉圓續開一批</h3>
<p>泉州大泡桂圓、據產區訊、劃申因難合算、故來源稀少、但此間以總結束為期愈近、購方不肯再加、雙方洽談結果、仍照原盤　交八百箱之譜、後市將俟春盤再開、</p>
<h3>五金　薄馬口鐵　現貨將斷</h3>
<p>薄馬口鐵銷塲以本街香烟廠餅乾廠製罐廠等為最大、客帮除天津略有指辦外、別帮殊少交易、其花色有正號副號之別、而正號貨有一百七十五張與一百九十五張之分、其價一百七十五張、每箱售一百二十元、一百九十五張每箱沽一百三十元、副號貨有有牘與無膽之區別、有膽貨每箱沽一百十八元、而無膽貨則售價在一百十元光景、均較前市好起五元至十元不等、惟現在市上現貨十分涸竭、買氣仍旺、如本星期內無到貨、則廢屬年內恐市上不免有斷　之憂、</p>
<h3>煤炭　鴻基白煤　又到二千噸</h3>
<p>火爐白煤、在冬令中、本屬旺銷季節、本年孤島人口激增、需要更繁、致客銷鼎盛、求過於供、目前寳多洋行有大批鴻基白煤到貨、計兩千噸、在洋涇浜排車上棧、　義泰興等經理售出、同行拆價、計開統塊每噸四十五元、篩塊四十七元、拷塊四十九元、同業棧房自出、客戶送到、另加行扛四元、聞此次來貨、年內將不續到、</p>
<h3>呢羢　市銷雖淡　價仍堅挺</h3>
<p>昨日呢羢市銷淸淡、門市現批交易亦稀、客帮成交無多、小客帮轉運溫州口岸者、尙有點級、而西服帮有零碎需要、故對於貨價方面、行情大半高昂、此蓋貨底奇缺、國內外定價報漲、業內外行吸墊熱烈、有以致之也、</p>

<h3>現代最適用之建築材料鋼筋混凝土</h3>
<p>— 軼羣</p>
<p>鋼筋混凝土自發明迄今，尙不及百年，而其用途之廣，已駕一切建築材料之上。所謂鋼筋混凝土其意義頗屬明顯，　在混凝土中另加鋼條，宛如筋絡也。混凝士乃以膠灰，（俗稱洋灰，水泥）砂，碎石三者混合，加水拌和凝固而成。惟膠灰亦可代以石灰，而膠灰復有天然人造之別，更有速凝緩凝之分。砂則大都為天然產品，以顆粒勻凈而有銳角者為最佳，不得已時用石屑代之亦可。碎石以質堅之火成岩擊碎者為上選，其他如石灰石，砂石之佳者亦可用。天然成碎塊之礫或卵石更所常用。至在石料十分缺乏之處，即以碎磚敲成小塊，亦往往用於次要之工程。其他用煤渣代石塊者，則用於基礎或舖路工程為多。水則僅需潔凈，不含油質酸性，及有機物者俱屬適用。普通所稱之鋼筋混凝土，均屬膠灰，砂，碎石所合成，蓋若用他項材料，往往强度不足，殊非所宜。</p>
<p>混凝土不僅所用之原料極為繁複，且其所含膠灰，砂，碎石三者之成分，亦各各不同。普通均以膠灰為標準，砂及碎石各為膠灰之若干倍，均以體積計之。例如一：二：四混凝土，即由一份膠灰，二份砂，及四份碎石所合成，餘可類推。膠灰所佔之成分愈多，則其强度愈大，惟砂及碎石之混質，亦大有關係，而加水之多寡，允不可忽視。因此混凝性之强度，不可僅憑其成分確定，惟有作實地試騐，始可得之。</p>
<p>鋼筋混凝土中所用之鋼條，普通均以各級鋼之鋼坯輾成，而以中級鋼為最佳。鋼條之表面，可分平整及變形二種，其截面或為方形，或為圓形，共有十一種標準尺寸。最細者為1/4圓鋼筋，最粗者為　方鋼筋。小徑之細鋼條，普通多作鋼筋及　圈之用。所謂變形鋼條，係將鋼條繞其縱軸扭轉，或於表面上鑄成竹節狀之突出，藉以增强混凝土與鋼筋間之粘結力，其效用殊廣。鋼筋混凝土用於建樓版及鋪路面時，尙有用網眼鋼鈑及鋼線織物以代鋼筋者，成效亦佳。</p>
<p>鋼筋混凝土在建築上之所以佔重要位置，良以其有特殊之優點，茲可分述如下。：　鋼筋為能耐拉力之材料，而混凝土之抗壓力特强，故二者兼用，遂可各盡其能，而合成極堅强之建築物。不特磚石工難與比擬，即昔之專以鋼鐵構成者，如橋樑，如水塔，亦每可以鋼筋混凝土建之。　鋼筋混凝土不特强度大，尤能耐久，一經建成，幾可不必加以修理。旣非若木材之易於朽蝕，更不如鋼鐵之須時加髹漆，而用於卑濕之區，及氣候突　之處為最佳。在基礎工程中所用之木樁，現今亦每用鋼筋混凝土樁代之、蓋即為此。　高樓大厦以能防火為最要條件，鋼筋混凝土不僅能建梁柱墻壁，即房屋內部之樓板及扶梯，亦無不可以鋼筋混凝土造成，故可絕對避免火災，而為最安全之材料。　鋼筋混凝土可用板框範成各種形式，大者如百呎高之閘壩，小者如數吋徑之管渠，殆皆可以鋼筋混凝土為之。且可構成一體，使其全無隙縫，故用於水利工程，尤具特效。　鋼筋混凝土所用之村料，除少量鋼筋外，其餘均可就地取材，需費極廉。即須自稍遠之處，這至工作地點，亦以各項材料易於搬運，不若整塊巨石或大型鋼件之笨重，故所需運輸費較省。　吾國建築材料極感缺乏，如用木材　鋼鐵，均須仰給於外洋，其漏巵之大，自不待言。若用鋼筋混凝土，則僅鋼筋須取材於他國，其他如砂及碎石固到處皆有，即國產之膠灰，其品質亦不亞於標準規定，儘可採用。</p>
<p>鋼筋混凝土工程，非無相當劣點，例如必需特製木板框模，因此材料及其裝卸工事，有額外之鉅額費用。又如配置鋼筋，拌合原料全恃適當之處理，吾則其弊害將不堪設想。惟模板拆除後，仍可移用於他處。至於處理鋼筋混凝土工程所需之技術，實遠不若磚石工及鋼鐵工之繁複。普通工人，稍加訓練，俱能為之。</p>
<p>綜上所述，可知鋼筋混凝土實為最優良之建築材料，在任何方面，俱屬利多而弊少，且其所需費用，恒可較其他材料為廉，又深合經濟原則，故其用途之廣，將有增無已焉。</p>
<p>鋼筋混凝土實施工事之一般：左為方柱，右為圓柱，中上舖築道路，中下建築拱形涵洞。</p>
<h3>低壓電的危險</h3>
<p>— 曉楠</p>
<p>洗澡時當心</p>
<p>一般工人都相信一個人假使沒有心臟病，他就使觸到110伏特或220伏特的高壓電，都不會發生致命的危險。但據美國威期丁好斯電器公司亞林（H．W．Arlin）君所發表實騐的報吿，假使觸電者的身體是濫的，那未就是12伏特的低壓電都有致命之虞：如果超過12伏特，更不必說。所以我們在洗渙時，伸手去開關電燈，是一件極危險的事。</p>
<h3>食物漫談</h3>
<p>— 新球</p>
<p>人體的構造和作用，很像一架精緻而複雜的機命，人類要進食物，眞如機器要加煤一樣。不過我們所進的食料，有的增進熱量，有的補償體質，更有些儲藏備用，那是非常複雜的。動物一般的特性往往由遺傳所規定，但是它所進的食物也有重大的關係。假使一個人通常只能長到五呎八吋的身高，任何特製的食物，也决不能使他超過此數，反之要是食物營養不足，這偭人傳不能達到五呎八吋的身材了。</p>
<p>平均每人終身約進五十噸左右的食物。而進七十磅食物，能長成身體上的一磅肉，我們每天約吸入三千卡路利的熱，健康的人，把道些「熱能」的三〇至四〇％改變為「動能」。人類進用食物，除把它變做能量之外，或者儲藏起來；更有些因為消化吸收的不完善，反而拋棄到體外去。所以對於食物一方面當然重視它的營養價値，同時消化吸收是否能充分進行，更是一件重要的事。</p>
<p>人類必需的食物原料，通常可以分做蛋白質，脂肪，碳水化合物和礦物質四大類。碳水化合物往往成為澱粉和糖，主要的功用是產生能量，在代謝作用中，它和脂肪多少是能够發生交互作用的。健康者全部食物的能量大槪四〇至五〇％得自碳水化合物，三〇至三五％得自脂肪。脂肪往住形成一種保護層，環繞着神經，它是神經的墊子。人體缺乏脂肪，固然易於病弱，同時亦不能獲得適富景脂溶性的維生素ADE等，在生理上有極大的危險，蛋白質是形成細胞生命基本原生質的要素，它的分子非常複雜，可是只有很少幾種化學原素包括在它的組織中，多數蛋白贊約含五一至五五％的碳，七％的氫，二〇至二三％的氣一五三至二％的硫，有些更含少量的燐質或鐵質，植物能够組成錏基酸而形成維持生命的蛋白質，所以動物所需的蛋白質大部取自植物。純粹的碳水化合物與蛋白質在體內發生氧化，大槪每克能生四卡路利的熱量，動物或植物性的脂肪能生九卡路利的熱。水只是組成食物大部分的重量，它並不能產生什麼能量。人類各種食物的化學組成，可代表地球上各種物質的橫剖面，不但各種原素都存在於食物之中，同時還得形成一種方式，使人體容易吸收，假使說身體上缺乏鐵質，那决不能直接吃下鐵礦以補償這種缺陷，因為這些原素，一定要等過特種組成之後，身體方能吸收利用。</p>
<p>現在巳經證明，個體健康的條件，至少須有五〇％的礦物質。根據這個標準，平均成人每天必須獲得〇六八克的鈣，鈣對於齒和骨的保存十分重耍，燐也一樣的要緊，鐵質是血液的耍紫，貧血的指數就是根據血紅素的含量而定。人體每天約有三％的血球在那裹繼續不斷地破壞，要是沒有鐵質補償那末血球的數量便反常而發生貧血症。由此可見食物中的礦物質在生理上也是一件重大的要素。</p>
<p>通常食物的消化程度，混合食物往往較高於單純者。食物的烹煎，目的在縮短消化時間而使它易於吸收，通過全部消化道的時間，的在十二至四十七小時範圍之內，過與不及都是反常現象。烹煮菜類最宜注意用水的量，以免礦物質與丙種維生素的消失。</p>
<p>人生藉食物以維持生命，更以多方的營養而增進健康，食物對於身體的密切關係，實在是値得重視。</p>
<h3>殺蟲的死光</h3>
<p>— 昔吾</p>
<p>使用時和手電筒一樣</p>
<p>幾年以前，有人傳說某國發明了一種死光，可使所照到的區域內，人無噍類。這眞是無稽之談，不值一笑。現在科學家所發明最厲害的死射綫，最多只能殺死小小的動物。</p>
<p>美國勒萊公司LerayCorporation）近製成了一種死光燈，呌做紅外綫燈，能殺死寄生於狗，貓和鳥身上的扁　，蚤和其他凉血小動物，亦能殺死傷害植物種子，布，木和其他材料的害蟲。據說此燈所發出的射錢亦能殺死細菌，故可用來除去植物的病菌。</p>
<p>現在這種死光的應用，槪着重於除去家畜身上的害蟲。本文的揷圖，係在美國紐約亞柏克隆比菲區（Abercrombieand　Fitch）運動器具公司拍得。該公司每天用這種燈表演照射顧客的狗，殺蟲的成績頗佳。</p>
<p>當然，把一只狗照射一次，並不能除去它身體上的一切害蟲。但是這並不是因為死光的力量不足以把它們立卽殺死，而是因為這些小動物常隔着短時間離開狗身；尤其當狗食飽和瞌睡時，它們離「羣」得更加頻繁。因此，狗窠裹的害蟲頗多；若要淸除狗窠，可用狗做餌，來誘殺它們。</p>
<p>這種死光燈的使用法，和使用手電筒一樣容易，只須把它持近於狗的身體，同時用另一手翻開狗毛，使射線射到狗皮卽得。但為使狗鎭靜起見，必須用燈預照數次，每次歷一短時間，直到它見燈不驚而止。在狗身上的每一部分照數分之一秒鐘到四五秒鐘，就可殺死該部分的一切害蟲。</p>
<p>用死光燈照殺狗身上的害蟲</p>
<h3>長距離無綫電打字機</h3>
<p>— （葉人）</p>
<p>這種無綫電打字原來是德國所發明，現在英美都已採用，它能傳遞文字到遠處印出。在發送機的內部有一個旋機圓筒，筒上載有普通打字機鍵盤上所有的字。發報司機人拍送一字，圓筒轉動，把符號變成重衝動而傳遞。在接收的一方，這動作的程序適相反，所接的電訊一字一字在一條紙帶上印出。下圖是幾條收信印字紙帶的照片。</p>
<h3>世界科學消息</h3>
<p>煤製襪</p>
<p>讀者大概曾在報紙上見過這種與論的。只消全美國的婦女不穿日本絲襪，就可給「友邦的經濟一個打擊，可知區區的襪也很値得我們重視。</p>
<p>新近某化學家發明從煤炭，空氣和水等極平常的原料中提製一種合成纖維，除可供裂襪外，又可製　　品，刷毛和可塑物。</p>
<p>此種纖維稱做「　綸」（Nylon），可以抽成精細而有光澤的絲，其牢固和鋼同　，且比天然纖維更有伸縮力。據說這是歷來人類從礦物製成有機織物纖維的第一次。</p>
<p>現在這種新合成物已應用於製造牙刷的毛，但最有希望的用途，却是製迭極薄而牢固，很有伸縮力而不易鬆落的襪類。其他可能的用途為製造縫衣線，編織品，網球拍的絃，釣魚繩，以及透明的包皮紙和衣料等。</p>

<p>電花式發送機之末日</p>
<p>由於國際之同意，自一九四〇年始所有高電力電花式發送機之通信，皆在禁止之例，三百瓦特電力以上之電花式發送站，自該年之一月一日起，均將停止營業。美國自一九二七年始，已有此種堅决主張，因此種高電力之電花式發送站，大足以擾亂國際間之廣播也。但雖有美國之反對，而低電力發送機之電信傳遞，仍得保持，然僅限於三種頻率，即探向器用之三百七十五任週，商業通信之四百二十五仟週及遇有意外事件而呼救（SOS）時用之五百仟週。</p>

<p>從空氣中提製家畜飼料</p>
<p>德化舉家近在貝勞愛斯集會中，以各種新奇發明，作一叙述，其中最令人注意者，有自空氣中取得家畜之飼料及以噪聲助金屬之變化等報吿。據稱家畜飼料之能使牛乳中所含乳油量大為增加者，現已能由空氣中提取氮化物及碳化物以製造之。又某種嗓聲能用以促成金屬中之化畢變化，如一種特製硬鋁，如過去所不能製造者，現已能製成之。又有一種橡皮之新替代物名「朋那」（Buna）者，能保持其彈性至攝氏零下六十至七十度，若普通橡皮在此溫度下，則早已脆若玻璃矣。</p>

<p>三種新維他命之發見</p>
<p>在醫學上，吾人已知維他命對於人身之重要，然其種類有幾，現時尙不能作一斷語，因新維他命之發見，國與日而俱進也。最近日本東京理化硏究所中有三位科學家，發見兩種新維他命，名之曰維他命L1及L2其報吿載於日本之「科學」雜誌，據稱此兩種維他命，均為母鼠生乳哺幼所不可少者。發酵粉中之酵母為維他命L2之來源，而維他命L1則得之於牛肝中。另有一種新維他命為D3，係德國哥丁根大學敎授溫道斯（Adolf　Windaus）及其同事所發現及提製共功用為阻止小兒之軟骨病，效力比維他命D2為大，魚油中即含有此物。</p>

<p>電視之術，實為輓近新奇發明之一，構造繁複，如欲使用之，初非易事。然今則有手握電視機之發明。在使用時，並不須暗室，其裝置，在外形上，實類一電話聽筒，其東量則不足二磅。使用者執此機置近頭側，一端為一耳片，覆於耳上，以作聽音之用，他端則為一目片，經此目片，可見一小型之電視幕：傳來之物像，即映現於其上，圖之大小，僅有一吋見方。由此吾人與友人作通長距離話時，非但能耳聞而且能目睹矣。</p>

<h3>樂觀</h3>
<p>— 無邪</p>
<p>我本來不是樂觀派，甚至還是悲觀派。可是自從「八一三」以來，我却漸漸改變了，到現在，已經成為十足的樂觀派了。</p>
<p>一定有人要說，以前我的生活太困苦，所以我悲觀，現在假使我不是「新貴」，也許發了「國難財」，所以得其所哉，事事樂觀了。這話，的確很合乎情理，因為正有許多人，是為了這樣，在那裹揚揚得意。</p>
<p>然而我的觀念的改變，雖然也由於我的環境的改變，而兩種改變的方式却比一般人所想的，適得具反。我以前的生活雖不怎樣的富麗，却還相當的寬裕，現在呢，難不至露宿街頭，或者託身難民所，却也的確到了左支右絀，捉襟見肘的地步。然而我以前是悲觀，現在是樂觀。</p>
<p>以前，我總覺得一個人飄飄蕩蕩，無所寄託。看了花要垂淚，對了月要嘆息，一天到晚，只要有空的時候，總要　着無病的呻吟。我的確想，人生是空虛的，社會是煩亂的，國家是不可救藥的，世界是永遠混沌的。我深信我虛此一生。我怨生。現在，我大不然了。自從受了砲火的洗禮，傾家蕩產以後，我一天到晚忙着，從忙中悟出了人生的眞意義。我更信，我的一生，不是徒然的。我可以做一些事，卽使是最微末的事，在人類的歷史上，都會留下一些成績。社會總會有安定的一日，而國家與世界，更有其可以樂觀的理由在！</p>
<p>近乎二十個月的抗戰，假使不是喪心病在，別有懷抱，那一個黃帝的子孫，不有確定的勝利觀念在胸中！因此，一些挫折，一些分裂，都不過是勝利之前，必有的過程罷了。最近「黨紀先生」的主張求和，更用不着悲觀，因為這樣，中樞就得澄淸，而一些渣滓都可以淘汰，不致從中破壞，妨得大局了。所以，關於抗戰，只要我們堅持到底，最後的勝利是毫無問題的，為什麼我們不樂觀呢！</p>
<p>至於世界，目前自然正是黑暗勢力抬頭，使人類進步受到阻碍的時候。但這只是一時的，正與迥光返照相同，是用不到為之而着急的。五千年的人類歷史上，我們可以看見不少的黑暗時期，而今日的世界，到底是進步了。這正是螺旋形的進行，雖然有向後退的地方，大體說來，到底還是向前的。黑暗，那只是光明的前奏，先驅。而且平均看來，雖然「天下大勢，一洽一亂」，畢電還是治多於亂，目前世界所遺遇的困難，不久必會過去，眞是一些也用不着焦心！</p>
<p>「生於患難，死於安樂，」這話就是我個人由悲觀而變為樂觀的最好註脚。「多難興邦」，「無敵國外患者國恒亡」，這話就是國家以及世界足以樂觀的最好解釋。我樂觀，我們大家都樂觀吧。</p>
<p>不過我們應得注意，所謂樂觀者，並非自得其「樂」而袖手旁「觀」。乃是要我們存一個高興鼓舞的心，用一份活躍自强的力，奮發前進，在個人的，國家的，以及一切的事上！</p>
<h3>殘照裏</h3>
<p>— 洪熖</p>
<p>四野裹靜悄悄的，北風很和緩地吹着。夕陽爬到了生命的邊緣，漲紅了臉，在獰視着大地。</p>
<p>阿福，小陸，老劉，三個兒緩緩地走到鎭上去，齊聲哼着老劉——年靑堅强的東北人新做的歌兒：</p>
<p>提起那民二十年的事，</p>
<p>那會使鐵人淚下；</p>
<p>我們的田地給敵人踐踏，</p>
<p>三千萬同胞變成牛馬！</p>
<p>我們被禁止說自己的話，</p>
<p>我們被趕出了自己的家。</p>
<p>我們再聽不到黑龍江嗚咽的寒潮，</p>
<p>再看不見長白山上那輝耀的雪花！</p>
<p>但，我們毋庸怨嗟，</p>
<p>我們决不讓敵人的旗幟長久飄揚，</p>
<p>我們要以眼還眼以牙還牙！</p>
<p>同胞們團結起來，</p>
<p>用血腥的戰鬥做我們的回答！</p>
<p>用血腥的戰鬥做我們的回答，回答！</p>
<p>反覆地哼着，離開西村只有三里多路了！</p>
<p>「老劉！你說，碰到要搜查的時候，怎辦？道幾桿傢伙？」阿福忽然輕輕地問那勇敢的鄕下人，一邊撫摩着左邊胸前微微突起的東西。</p>
<p>「傻子，怕什麼！不給咱們麻煩，那算了，給他們多活幾個鐘點！不然，哼！不耐煩活，送他們回去得啦！」老劉爽利地這樣回答。</p>
<p>「不過，這對於我們的任務有些兒不便當吧：」小陸冷冷地說着。</p>
<p>沒有第二個人接下去說話，四園空氣也寂靜了下來。</p>
<p>突然阿福拉住老劉的衣袖，止住在路上，輕輕的用嘴向前努着：哼！當心！來啦！」</p>
<p>在前面十來丈路的地方，兩個東西抱着兩枝三八，嘻嘻哈哈的向這邊走來。</p>
<p>「別管他，向前留心地走吧！太陽快下去了呢！」老劉若無其事地說。</p>
<p>近了，兩面只離開丈把路了！</p>
<p>兩個東西大搖大擺喝醉了似地蠕動着，看見這邊三個雄赳赳的伙伴，趕忙就拿起上着刺刀的三八，嘴裏咕嚕着：</p>
<p>「站住！站住！壤來西！游擊隊。」</p>
<p>「他媽的，得大爺動手！」老劉暗罵着，隨即向小陸阿福使了個眼色。</p>
<p>兩個立刻向前走了一步，站在路中，舉着手。老劉亦跟着這樣做，但站的地位比較落後一些。</p>
<p>「哈哈哈……！」對方得意地點着，都一手握着步槍，一手來搜小陸阿福他們的身上。</p>
<p>出其不意的老劉攫下了那亮閃閃的刺刀，隨即敏捷的一刀直戳進了搜着小陸的那個的腦壳。倒了！</p>
<p>另一個正想回身逃，阿福早就一把拖住了。想呌，小陸已一手蓋住了他的嘴吧！他漲紅着險，拚命地掙扎着！</p>
<p>老劉照那個一樣給他頭頂上開了個窟窿，一邊嘴裹恨恨地罵着：</p>
<p>「小雜種，躭誤了大爺的時光！今天大爺得爽快的多宰你幾個！哼！你們快活啊！」</p>
<p>夕陽漲着煊紅的臉已快到地平錢，但在沒落前還返射着一抹殘光。</p>
<h3>各顯神通</h3>
<p>— 麗華</p>
<h3>獨裁者的側面（下）</h3>
<p>— 哲非譯</p>
<p>莫索里尼</p>
<p>莫索里尼將意大利的人民一如他的意志訓練了，意國的國王在他的面前就活像一個小廝，可是莫案里尼却不能（也許不願）牽着鄧娜·拉契爾，莫索里尼的鼻子走。</p>
<p>莫索里尼的父親從前曾在他的鐵匠舖　壁開一家酒排間，鄧娜·拉契爾就在那裏擦擦玻璃，她這種生活習慣，迄至今日尙沒有改變。「鄧娜」是種尊號，只有A字級金領階段的夫人才能用這稱號。</p>
<p>莫索里尼將她的妻子遷到廣大的多侖尼亞別墅，地點在羅馬附郊。可是她並不愜意，於是就揀了進口處一所簡單的房子作她的住宅。她就在這裹為她的那隻「老虎」管家，他白天在外邊打家劫舍後，晚上就回到窠裏。</p>
<p>只有一個羅馬的記者幸運地和鄧娜·拉契爾會談過一次，她說她的丈夫白天儘可像一隻老虎般游走，但在八點半前一定得像一隻馴貓似的回到家中。據說莫素里尼曾向這位訪員說：「如果鄧娜拉契爾願意這樣，我一定像隻馴貓般回到家裹。」</p>
<p>莫索里尼在二十五歲時帶了一隻梵亞玲向拉契爾求婚。羅馬的報紙有一時曾充分討論過他的梵亞玲能力。現在全意大利都認為他是一個偉大的琴手。但鄧娜·拉契爾已定下法律，這位「偉人」一定得將他的劍，梵亞玲和演講稿留在寫字間裹。</p>
<p>鄧娜·拉契爾並不想干涉她丈夫的政治。可是在她管理的家庭之內，她不容有一僩競爭者。早晨她飼過小鷄後，就拿着一隻籃從小街走到市塲上，人家對她也不會得大驚小怪。市塲上的商人都曉得她是一個門檻精明的買客。</p>
<p>鄧娜·拉契爾從來不同她丈夫一起在公共塲所出現。她的老朋友來看她，她也覺得不足為奇。她去訪問他們，也不正式先期通知。</p>
<p>除了在有嚴重的事情時外，莫素里尼母夜八點半准到家來吃飯，晚上就在家裹消磨過去。甚至他的敵人也承認他的妻子從夾不為她的朋友們做裙帶工作。大家曉得她幫助過　時的窮「同志」，但她從不請她丈夫給他們帮忙。她用她自己的所有暗底下帮助他們。</p>
<h3>徬徨</h3>
<p>— 抱一</p>
<p>離羣的羊、無舵的舟，茫茫然飄泊在渺無邊際的人生中，一點抓不着實際，悲哀，憤怒，徬徨，包圍了一身，耳聞，目睹，盡是悽慘的景象！</p>
<p>我不願再這樣地生活下去了，這樣的生活下去，我深信我的生命會無意義的斷送了的。我要驅除四周環繞着我的敵人，我要衝破一切黑暗的環境，我要從徬徨的當中去求得砥直的道路，達到理想　樂地。</p>
<p>但，理想的勁敵，牠絲毫不放鬆我，牠更猙獰地向我肆威，用更殘酷的手段來加緊對我壓迫。生活的鞭笞，無情地向着我抽打，無寬裕的餘地，給我以喘息的機會。人情的險惡，處處施用着毒辣的手面來控制着我。我脆弱的心靈，經不起這樣的打擊，壓迫，我不禁痛楚起來而流淚了！</p>
<p>然而，單是靠了流淚，仍是脫不了，徬徨的境界。這不啻是向黑暗的環境表示屈服了，這顯然是環境的勝利，對本身的痛苦絲毫未得解脫。這除了表示十足的懦弱外，無其他積極的行動來代替奮鬬的。</p>
<p>我知道痛苦是螺旋式的，在人生的過程當中，是無窮盡的。不明白人生觀的人，把痛苦和安樂分成兩個部份，其實痛苦和安樂是永遠地聯繫在一起的；沒有痛苦，就不知道有安樂，知道了痛苦，然後纔能體會到安樂呢。</p>
<p>我要從痛苦的深淵當中，力自振作起來：我要用最大的决心，來克復黑暗的環境，不悲觀，不徬徨，一心一意地向着理想的樂地走去。對以前人生觀念的錯誤，失却奮鬬的勇氣，從今天起須大大的改變一下。那就是要用堅强的毅力，果敢的决心，來代替悲觀和徬徨，來穩定未來的前途。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>你就要到前方去了，這一去，是為了爭取國家的勝利，我也不希望你能回來。不過在你還沒有走以前，我們大家應該好好的安排一下，要是戰事接近到這里來，那我們一家人該得怎麼辨？』</p>
<p>葉團長皺了皺濃眉，指骨又刮的響了一下。</p>
<p>『我看這里沒有鐵路公路，又非軍事要道，縱使戰事接近，也不見得會打到這里來的，至多四周都被牠控制住罷了。剛才那一顆炸彈，其實也是大家擠着嚷的不好，牠錯認做我們的軍隊集中在這里，才扔下來的，所以實在一些都沒有什麼要緊。倘若將來形勢眞的危急時，那就設法僱一隻船，到太湖裹去避一避也可以了。』</p>
<p>『最好呌方俊就不要再回到軍隊裹去，』葉太太用担心而又自以為有見識的口氣說：「前綫的槍砲炸彈一定還要多，呌人怎麼能放心得下！』</p>
<p>『呸！你這眞是女人見識，方俊現在已經不是我們家裹的人，而是國家的人了，怎麼能由得你隨便呌他不回去？』葉老先生不住搖着頭說。</p>
<p>『委是奉令打游擊，那我很可能再到這里來。』葉團長用不確定的口氣說，眼光裹顯然也閃爍着保衛家鄕的願望。『不過道里的形勢很不好，實在不適官做游擊根據地。東面就是蘇嘉路，北面也讓北　平望封住了，這些交通綫一給敵人佔領，游擊隊要活動和取得給養就都非常困難。』</p>
<p>葉老先生聽得呆了，手頭的一根紙煤將要燒到指縫裹也不覺得。</p>
<p>『據你道樣說，那這地方實在很不好，我們還是趁早逃難吧。』</p>
<p>『不錯，趁早逃難。』葉太太非常贊成的附和了一句。</p>
<p>葉團長却沉吟着。</p>
<p>『逃難，這話不是我們做軍人的人應該說的，並且現在是全面抗戰，全國沒有一處地方能够悻免戰禍，無論逃到什麼地方去都是一樣。我的意思，大家最好暫時不要動，看將來的情形，或者留在這里，或者跟着我們的軍隊撤退。』（七）</p>

<h3>妖怪歌</h3>
<p>— 金丁</p>
<p>陶知行近作　生活敎育家陶知行先生，他是一直主張實踐主義的。八年前，主持南京曉莊師範的時候，和學生們煮飯，挑糞，樣樣都親自動手。他常常說：「在生活中得到的經騐，才是眞的敎育，活的敎育。」因此他的敎育目標，是「生活敎育」，中「敎學合一」的敎育。</p>
<p>「八一三」民族抗戰的砲聲一響，陶先生便站在時代的前綫，幹著文化戰士的生活，最近，做了一首白話詩，送給「游擊隊的母親」趙老太太，詞意明暢，眞可以說是婦孺都懂。現在，把它抄在下面，以廣流傳：</p>
<p>『東海出妖怪，中國出老太！</p>
<p>老太捉妖怪，妖怪都嚇壞！</p>
<p>老太有名言，救國莫能外！</p>
<p>別死在床上，戰死才痛快！』</p>
<h3>掩埋屍體的普善山莊</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>戰後材廠遷至戈登路仍努力工作　八一三到現在掩埋屍棺六七萬具</p>
<p>普善山莊是專事掩埋工作的一個慈善機關，在上海已有著悠久的歷史，最近爲了經費的不足，曾假座黃金大戲院演劇募捐，參加的全是海上的聞人，　閣，名媛，以及樂善社票房。</p>
<p>我們知道：普善山莊在戰前所做的慈善工作，主要的就在施材和掩埋。『八一三』戰事爆發，爲了難民的擁擠和慘事的疊見，施材和掩埋的工作，也就格外緊張。在戰事期內，我們在馬路上看見印有藍十字的掩埋車輛，便是普善山莊的。</p>
<p>戰事離開上海而後，租界上面，人口是這樣多，結果普善山莊的工作，正和戰事期內一樣，每天在忙著掩埋。據說自「八一三」到日前爲止，由普善山莊掩埋的屍棺，已達六七萬具，這個數字，也夠使你驚駭吧？</p>
<p>貧苦的人，死了之後，沒有收殮，就都由普善山莊收去，一具薄板棺材載往四郊去埋掉。這種棺材，大半由樂善之士捐助，據說捐示十元，就可由普善山莊施材一口，而公館中的奶奶，太太，更有許多以爲施材是莫大的善事，而常常捐助的。但「八一三」之後，難民和平民死亡得委實太多了，結果使普善山莊所需的經費也因以加多，而時感不足。</p>
<p>特別使我們驚駭的，是去年的春冬之交，上海痧症盛行，兒童遭遇空前厄運，不知死去多少。貧苦的人家，兒女死去了，就用棉被或蒲包裏緊了，丟在馬路旁邊，弄堂口頭，也有用一口小棺材的。這種死孩子，就由普善山莊每天收去掩埋。</p>
<p>當時普善山莊的藍十字收屍卡車，打馬路上巡行一次，小蒲包，小棺材，就堆了一車像山樣高，死孩子的頭顱，小手，露出面外面，使人目覩之下，有點莫名的悲痛。最近天花又非常盛行，蒲包，小棺材，拋棄在街頭巷尾者，也到處可見，雖然沒有去年的多，普善山莊的收屍車上，每天也收到半車孩屍。</p>
<p>這些屍體，他們收去是埋在滬市四郊，最多是虹橋一帶。租界成了「孤島」，什麽都不自由，家裏死了人，也發生問題，棺柩不能隨便抬出租界。有錢的人家，可出了錢寄在殯儀館或寄材所裏，窮人是不能爲死人而再耗若干錢了，但普善山莊可爲你解決這難題，替你把棺柩運到租界外面去埋掉。埋葬的地方，每一個棺材有一記號，將來戰事敉平，如果要運回鄉下去安葬，就可照記號掘起來。</p>
<p>普善山莊的材廠本來在南市，辦事處在六馬路仁劉堂，戰後，材廠就搬到租界上，在戈登路康腦脫路附近。外面圍著籬笆，裏面是一塊曠塲，堆滿了漆過的，沒有漆過的木板棺材，好多木匠，在忙著工作，把一口口棺材釘攏來，漆好之後，墨色上印有一個藍十字。同時，每天有七八個身上穿著藍十字背心的掩埋工人，坐在卡車上，出去收屍，埋屍。卡車早上開出去，要到夜晚回來，對於這班爲慈善事業和都市衛生而工作的掩埋人員，我們應該表示懇切的敬意，而給予幫助的。</p>
<h3>歲尾年頭</h3>
<p>— 雪生作</p>
<h3>總結事期的前夜</h3>
<p>— 新亮</p>
<p>習俗難移過了一年又一年　上海的金融市塲穩定如常</p>
<p>眞不知道什麽道理，中國人一染上了某種習慣，就不很容易改除掉。譬如，陰曆的廢除吧，自從民國成立以來，政府即公告吾們應該使用陽曆，可是直到目前爲止，一般的人家，尤其是做生意的，與鄉間的農民，都還是在沿用著陰曆改除，反而，與它顯得更如膠似溱的樣子，一些都不肯放棄或遺忘。所以，吾們也就可以很希奇地說：『每一個中國人，至少都會過兩個年關與兩個新年。』</p>
<p>不多幾時前，吾們已經度過了一個年關與新年——陽曆新年，那時候的熱烈的，瘋狂的慶祝情況，迄今還深深地烙印在吾們的腦際；而一轉眼之間，另一個年關，連帶的也有一個新年——陰曆新年，卻又要在最短的一個時期里，來臨在吾們的面前了。</p>
<p>上海的錢業同業公會，已經議定了陽曆二月十八日——陰曆十二月三十日（大除夕）——爲民國二十七年度的總結束期。又十九，二十，二十一，二十二——陰曆正月初一，初二，初三，初四——等四天爲總結賬期，各莊都一律在這期間里休假辦理結束。</p>
<p>當然啦，爲了中國人特別愛好陰曆的緣故，過去陽曆新年的盡況，比起即將到來的陰曆新年的來，終要較遜一籌。除了極少數的時代家庭以外，在部份的上海人，都喜歡過陰曆年，他們的那種忙碌的，緊張的準備過年的神情，眞要使吾們驚駭起來。對陽曆年關與新睥，一般人還可以說：『吾們是老法的，是舊式的；吾們是只過陰曆年的。』之類的話來搪塞，然而，對這個陰曆年關與新年，卻是無可如何地，必須要來準備應付一下了。即使是一年到頭都在艱辛的苦環境下掙扎過活的人們，對眼有的陰曆總結束期，也都打算儘可能地使它好好地度過的。</p>
<p>這幾天，正所謂是『總結束』的時期，人們的生活，不知比平日要緊張起多少倍——有錢的人家，自然不消說得，是送年禮啦，準備過年的物品像年糕，果盤，喜封啦，裁製過年的新衣，新鞋啦……等等，忙得眞正是不亦樂乎，就是一般中下階級的人們，也都在整理整理舊的東西，打掃打掃房間，燒些新年里的小菜……預備在總結束期過後，樂上幾天的。</p>
<p>其中，鬧得最忙的，還是算那些商家店舖。各業都根據錢業公會的決議辦理，在這個總結束期尚未到來，而即要到來的當兒，忙著準備一切；對本埠的賬款，儘快地分發清單，限期償清；對外埠的賬款，也分別遣派專員，前往催收，負責的經理，更須調度「頭寸」，以便安穩度過這總結束期。其他又有『謝年』呀，『盤貨』呀……總之，在這個期里，大家都是忙忙地，一些都沒有眼空的辰光的。</p>
<p>據生意塲中人言，上海在戰後，爲了人口的增加，四鄉各地工廠的被毀，以致各種店舖，工廠，都相繼擁來了租界里，造成了上海的畸形發展；關於上海的金融市塲，亦依然穩定如常，一些都沒有混亂之象，因此，今年的總結整期，大家當可望沒有不幸的事件發生了。</p>

<p>第三回　迎遺容追思老義士　開文盲問字小先生</p>
<p>何儷玉很靈敏的，笑首說道：「喔！我知道了！我知道你和林先生，快要結婚了。到底是幾時呢？那我們當然是要來吃喜酒呀！」金澹雲道：「就在下一個月呀。所以我盼望你早些來呢。」何雙玉道：「那自然！我們一定來。我們暫進也不回到廣東去，就是我們父親，也有好幾個月耽擱，方向上海來。你們定了日子，只要通個信給我，馬上就來。不許不告訴我們呀！」金澹雲道：「要不告訴你們，此刻也不說了。到那時我有一個月例假，我要和你們一同去玩。」何儷玉鼻子裏嗤的笑了一聲道：「到那時還和我們一同去玩嗎？你自有一同去玩的人了。」使指著林建成吃吃而笑。又問：「在什麽地方結婚？有什麽儀式？」澹雲道：「並沒有什麽儀式，只不過到市政府婚姻局註冊就完了，不過晚上想請一回客，也沒定地方。有好多朋友，……」指著林建成道：「都是他的朋友哪！要我們開跳舞會，我們也沒有答應，這是多靡費呀！我們雖然都留學外國，我們不能學外國的樣。外國人的奢華而好虛榮，這眞是資本主義國家的危機呢？」林建成道：「說起外國人的奢華，我還記起一件事來。在一九三八年吧！吾中國正在戰爭時代，我那時剛十五歲。爲了要知道時事消息，我是天天在看報的。在那年除夕的狂歡之夜，紐約一個消息，說是那一天晚上的大菜，平均每客是三十元美金。當時中國與美國的滙兌，就是美金一元，值中國法幣六元。我那時一算，三十元美金一客的大菜，就是中國法幣一百八十元一客的大菜。試想：一百八十元，只吃一客大菜，當時把我童稚的心也嚇破了。因爲在當時，正是中國有許多難民，正沒有吃。許多救濟會在那裏募捐，只要每天有一毛錢，就可以過活。那末一百八十元一客的大菜，就可以使一千八百人一天過活，這算盤是並沒有算錯呀。後來我到了外國以後，這美金三十元的大菜，我雖沒有吃過，但我想也不過尋常。難道吃了，就永留在齒頰間嗎？想想我們從前的艱難吃苦，我們現在也不忍奢華呢。」（三四）</p>

<p>北平李麗應聯藝公司主演之「一代尤物」，已經拍竣，李得酬金（港幣）二千五百元，由滬上明星張翼，姚萍，蔣君超，白璐，及港中明星聯合演出，國語拷貝之外，復配一粵語拷貝，片定農歷新年中公映，在港公映之拷貝為國語，粵語拷貝售諸馬來及荷屬各埠，前傳中華藝術劇國團員參加此片演出，實誤。李來港時寓六國飯店，近已遷至香港對海九龍新亞旅館，聞有赴滬重操伴舞生涯之說，確否待證。</p>
<p>國防影片層出不窮</p>
<p>國營製片機關，屬於軍事委員會第三廳轄下之中國電影製片廠，自漢遷重慶以後，更努力於國防電影之攝製。抗戰以來，該廠攝裂關於前綫軍事動態之新聞片「抗戰特輯」，已有六輯，前五集已在港演過，第六集亦將公映，富國防性之連本長本，已在港放映者有「保衛我們土地」（史東山導演，舒繡文，魏鶴齡主演）「熱血忠魂」（袁叢美編導，高占非，黎莉莉，何非光主演）「八百壯士」（陽翰笙編劇，應雲衛導演，袁牧之，陳波兒，陳樹藩，洪虹主演）頃據該廠技術股長羅靜予語記者，該廠現在攝製中或籌備攝裂之新片有「最後一滴血」（洪深編導，金山，王瑩，田方主演，何非光，陳天國主演），「中國的怒吼」，（袁牧之編導），「幼年中國」（陽翰笙編劇，史東山導演），「娘子軍」（孫師毅編劇，袁叢美導演），「抗戰進行曲」（唐瑜編劇，應雲衛等聯合導演），「中國萬歲（王為一改編，史東山導演），「創造」（袁叢美編導），此外，該廠决定在港創設分廠，第一片係蔡楚生編導之「南海風雲」，由黎莉莉，張翼，蔣君超等主演，黎莉莉已自渝繞道海防抵港，開拍之期已近。蔡楚生編寫「南海風雲」劃本，特到香港海口漁民生活區考察多日，蓋「南海風雲」主要的描寫，為揭露漁民生活的掙扎苦况，而滲以國防意識，較當年蔡氏名作「漁光曲」更進一步之作品也。</p>
<p>司徒慧敏來港以後，與蔡楚生合作攝製「血濺寳山城」一片，公映時，極受與論界之贊美，近又完成一部「遊擊隊進行曲」，顧名思義，可知又為一富民族意識國防片，由張翼，金鈴（即前梅花歌舞團團員容小意改名）等主演，中有歌曲兩支，由任光安娥夫婦合撰</p>
<p>攝影技師紛往前線</p>
<p>名導演孫瑜現在盧慶中央電影攝影塲任職編導，中央影塲亦與國營製片機關，係屬中央宜傳部電影科，該廠近在攝製長片有沈西苓編導之「中華兒女」（白揚，越丹，施超，顧而已，魏鶴齡中演）潘孑農編導之「民族的母親」（趙丹，王蘋主演），孫瑜編導「長空萬里」（高占非，白揚主演），余仲英編導之「流浪的孩子」（牟菱主演），徐蘇靈編導之「孤城喋血」（柏森，白雲合演，）此外分派攝影師在前綫攝製有關抗戰之新聞片，計派往在江浙者有葉炯，連城，皖贛者有羅敬浩，余建中，康藏者有黎錫勳，新疆者有宗維賡，兩廣者有黃天鵬，兩湖者有童震，長駐重慶者有裘逸　，洪偉烈，陳為謨，王雨聲，王樂天等，據該廠在港代表李公恪君云，過去中央影廠在各地所映之新聞片，極受觀衆歡迎，營業收入，不僅足敷經常開支，而且有餘，此亦足見民氣之一斑。</p>

<p>「花濺淚」係于伶先生的新作，這個戲從交給「上海劇藝社」排演的消息透露了出來以後，各方面都相當地對它　視，昨天上午，該劇苜次在卡爾登試演，佈景是一九三七年五月至八一三之間的一幅舞塲男女生活畫。</p>
<p>開幕晏了三刻</p>
<p>為了招待新聞界和有關係各方面的緣故，這一次綵排便在上午假卡爾登舉行，看白戲是挺够味兒的，小小一座戲院子，不到十點鐘，下面的座位已經坐了七八成，這裹面有報人，劇人，文化人，于伶先生依舊是藝人本色，墨晶眼鏡架在一個蓬散頭髮的頭上，佈景化裝的時間太匆促了些，因此開幕便晏了三刻鐘。</p>
<p>有趣味的玩意</p>
<p>第一幕是大上海舞廳的背景，觀衆們聽到Lambeth　Walk音樂的配奏，都顯出了太熟悉的樣子，藍蘭的「舞女曲」，由擴音機發出宏亮的聲音，頗為動聽。</p>
<p>第三幕咪咪自殺的一瞬間，藍蘭舉起了來沙爾的藥瓶倒進了玻璃杯子要喝，台下突然發出一聲淸脆的「牛肉汁」聲音，於是閧堂大笑了，夏霞趕忙奔上去阻止她自殺，一失手，杯子跌落台上，「牛肉汁」飛濺開來，坐在第一排的我黑大衣上濕了一大片，杯子碎了，幸而「牛肉汁」不是眞來沙而。</p>
<p>難為了演員們</p>
<p>全劇演員不多，但因為要適合劇情，男演員穿的是白嗶嘰西裝，但女演員則一件薄薄的國袍是無論如何不够暖的，結果，紅凍的耳朵，微顫的銀牙，唱歌的時候，寒冷在聲帶上又起了一點作用，坐在水汀旁邊的朋友，還脫不下那件冬令大衣，不是難為了演員們？</p>
<p>四幕演了三幕</p>
<p>果然給我猜中了，卡爾登二點半還要開電影，四幕戲無論如何是演不完的，而第三幕的結束，時針指了一點半，一位戴了眼鏡的侏儒先生走出了幕前報吿停演的原因，其實，也有幾個耐不了肚子餓的朋友，早已溜之大吉，本來如果要看一個整齊或者純熱點的戲劇，在公演到最末後成續會越佳妙的經騐往往倒眞如實在的呢！</p>

<p>— 醉籬舘編印</p>
<p>未開言，不由人，心中惱恨。罵一聲，在精衛，賣國的奸臣。先總理，對待你，那般親信。原望你，遵守遺囑，把革命的事業，早完成。全中國，統一了，是何等的僥倖。就該把，三民主義，五權憲法，雷厲的去施行。又誰知，你的利祿心，日新月盛。時而南，時而北，慣吹牛皮，亂拍馬屁，顚三倒四，倒四顚三，連你自己也說不出是何原因。敵與我，早結下，血海冤恨。你那裹，糊裹糊塗，皂白不分，認賊作父，為的是何情。似這等的賣國賊，誰人不恨。再帶着，這假面具，也是遮不住你的原身。你休再要胡思亂想，心不定。你就滾，滾，滾，滾到外國，去作你的浪人！</p>

<h3>故都宫闈梨園秘史（九九）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>兩生兩旦兩淨為吃戲醋眞打眞駡</p>
<p>吃醋原是女人的特性，但是戲班裹却有這種吃戲醋的怪事，並且吃起醋來格外厲害，弄得不好就會在台上眞打眞罵，拼個你死我活；諺云：「二虎相爭，必有一傷，」所以結果總得有一個吃了大虧，栽了筋頭，這事才算完結。民國以來，我所見到的，曾有三檔子事，生·旦·凈·每行一對，共計六位名伶。這六位的大名就是何月山·蓋呌天·尙小雲·荀慧生·郝壽臣·侯喜瑞，恰巧是兩生兩旦兩淨，待我逐一分述如下，也足見晚近諸名伶的戲德，是比前輩先生們差的遠了。</p>
<p>二十多年前上海有位勇猛武生名呌何月山的，他演「鐵公雞」使川眞刀眞槍，簡直同拼命的一般，論起他的短打戲，除了年老的李春來不算外，在海上也很可獨步一時了。况且他扮相父好，唱兩句也能對付着聽聽。。有時他還自炫其多才多藝，反串「釣金龜」的老旦，這與已故的呂月樵和現存的塲瑞亭，都是以假嗓唱乙字調的老旦腔，情形正復類似。不過作藝的人最忌太滿太驕，萬不可一個人把各行的飯都搶着吃光。從前的三慶班主程長庚，何嘗不能兼演生行以外的名戲，但他總是備而不用，非遇到班中某角拿巧的時候，他才一顯身手，演出個樣子讓拿巧的角兒瞧瞧，使他以後好死了那種壞念頭，安心在班中唱戲。這是他們當班主的一種駕馭同行的眞本領，平時絕不以此炫奇，所謂戲有戲德，總得給旁人留出吃飯的道兒。何月山因為不明瞭這裏邊的利害，方才激怒了一位路見不平的蓋老五，把月山打倒在台上，竟至口吐鮮血，從此一蹶不振，聲名日衰，這也是他自炫多才的報應。</p>

<p>(Yuanqu) The Japanese army, which fought against the Chinese army at Wangjiali, Guan Ya Zhuang on the 2nd, concentrated all its forces at 4:00 AM on the 3rd, using intense artillery fire to attack the Yangjiazhuang area held by the Chinese side. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, the Chinese army divided its troops and moved to the nearby mountains, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. At around 6:00 AM, the Japanese army invaded Yangjiazhuang. The Chinese army took advantage of their unstable position, immediately launched an attack, and bombarded the Japanese army with artillery fire. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army collapsed to the west. A portion of more than 1,000 retreated to the villages of Du Yun Nanbao and Li Cao to resist stubbornly.

This shows that the Japanese army may once again attack western Shanxi in order to reach the east bank of the Yellow River and enter Shaanxi Province. (6th Associated Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek recently urged young men among the families of Central Government and Kuomintang personnel to enlist in the army in order to set an example for the people. This appeal is contained in a circular issued by the Central Executive Committee. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek stated that it is the duty of citizens to enlist in the army to defend the country, but since the implementation of the conscription system, only farmers have enlisted, and there have been very few applicants from the families of party and government personnel. It is hoped that in the future, the sons and daughters of government personnel and party members will also enthusiastically enlist in the army, not only to set an example for the people, but also to strengthen the strength of the war of resistance.

<h3>Japanese Army in Eastern Hubei Increases Defenses; Fearing Attacks</h3>
<p>(Zhongxiang) Recently, a unit has come to Qilidian in eastern Hubei from Huang'an. More than 1,000 Japanese troops have also arrived at Baifosi, Dong Songjia'ao, and Egongling in northeastern Tuanfeng. At the same time, 300 more Japanese troops have been transferred to Lanxi from Huangshigang. The sudden increase in Japanese troops in the aforementioned areas is due to the fact that Chinese guerrillas appear and disappear unpredictably, fearing being attacked. (7th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhongxiang) The Chinese guerrillas captured a package of documents from a certain Japanese squadron near Woshan the other day. Among them was a list of personnel for that squadron, which stated that the squadron had been replenished five times in half a year.

<h3>Japanese Air Force Continues to Ravage the Route Between Shiqi and Macau; Foreign News Agency Reporters Inspect Various Places and See Chinese Volunteers Building Roads and Maintaining Order</h3>
<p>(Guangzhou) According to reports here this morning, the Japanese authorities suddenly announced the closure of the Pearl River for ten days on Friday of last week for "military reasons." As a result, the regular Japanese commercial ships and British gunboats between Guangzhou and Macau could not enter the Pearl River. A special correspondent from the Haitian News Agency, who was originally on his way to Macau for inspection, had to take the land route, passing through Shiqi to Macau. He personally saw that although the area he passed through was directly outside Guangzhou, it was not occupied by Japanese troops but maintained order by Chinese volunteers. Some volunteers were building roads, while others patrolled the various canals surrounding the entire Zhongshan County. They were busy with their work, and the order was well maintained. The residents showed friendliness to foreigners. There are regular small boats between Shiqi and Macau, maintaining transportation, patrolled and supervised by Chinese regular police. The section between Shiqi and Macau is considered the most dangerous part of the journey from Hong Kong to Macau. The Japanese Air Force recklessly strafes cars and buses with machine guns. The reporter personally saw three passengers killed the other day. Therefore, each car has a special observer who specializes in looking at the sky. As soon as he sees a Japanese plane approaching, he reports to the driver to avoid it. According to rumors here, the reason why the Japanese authorities closed the Pearl River is because Japanese warships in the Pearl River are moving south. For example, seven Japanese transport ships sailed south from the Pearl River via Macau the other day. (Haitian News Agency, 7th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Chamberlain's Statement on Aiding France: A Forward-Looking Perspective</h3>
<p>"Aggression must extend to weak points; peace relies on the guarantee of military strength."</p>
<p>This is truly a philosophy filled with bloodshed, exposing bestiality, and a theory that abandons heavenly principles and contradicts human morality. It should be disdained by wise thinkers and deeply abhorred by morally upright individuals. However, the level of civilization of general humanity has not improved for a long time, remaining stuck at the current stage and being dominated by this theory. Those who disregard this theory often suffer the consequences; those who measure all real-world problems with this theory rarely fail. The contradiction between knowledge and action has reached such an extreme. Are we, the people of the world, who usually consider ourselves rational animals, not greatly ridiculous! The distant need not be discussed. China, for a long time under the watchful eyes of a tiger, believed that the League of Nations and the Nine-Power Treaty could provide protection, and was thus trampled by foreign powers. This is an example of suffering the consequences of disregarding the philosophy of bloodshed. Italy crossed the sea and desert to take Abyssinia, and Germany annexed the Czech Republic and Austria. These are clear examples of aggression towards weak points. Autocratic countries see democratic countries with multiple parties, litigiousness, greed for wealth, and fear of war as weak. The German-Italian axis sees the loose alliance between Britain and France as weak. Italy sees France's declining birth rate as weak. Thus, they roll up their sleeves, brandish their fists, and sharpen their knives, making endless demands. If democratic countries remain as weak and disorganized as before, and continue to naively believe in promises and lip service diplomacy, then they will either have to submit obediently or hastily engage in war. The global situation is unpredictable. Fortunately, the lesson in the Munich classroom was a real-life demonstration, directly instructing and admonishing. Thus, the philosophy of bloodshed was annotated as iron, and world affairs began their transformation.</p>
<p>How did the transformation come about? It came about because each country enacted its unprecedented military expenditure budget. The United States rushed to build a large number of military aircraft for Britain and France. France expressed its determination not to cede an inch of territory. The Soviet Union expressed its respect for the Franco-Soviet Pact. Mr. Roosevelt expressed that he would definitely help democratic countries. And as of yesterday, the British Prime Minister, the gentle and venerable Mr. Chamberlain, made a simple, clear, resolute, and forceful statement in the Lower House: Britain will not ask where the threat to France comes from and will go to its aid with all its strength. Such a statement is not only a creative work in the life of a 70-year-old man but also a page in international political history that should be prominently recorded and be epoch-making after the European War. Prior to this, Britain and France, either responding to each other, or having a tacit understanding, or having reached an agreement, had common interests in survival, so their relationship was inseparable. However, there were those who believed that Britain and France were not so close, and they tried to drive a wedge between them through diplomatic means. Prior to this: Britain and France were not prepared for war, but if there were a war, they would advance together. However, there were those who still believed that the war was for France, and Britain would not fight for France. Therefore, they showed goodwill to Britain in diplomacy, while trying to isolate France and make it the sole object of attack on military grounds. Prior to this: Some feared that the war would drag on, and Britain might eventually help France, but in the initial stages of the war, Britain would remain aloof, leaving room for diplomatic maneuvering. In terms of strategy, the key was to strike France and defeat it in one fell swoop. But with Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement as of yesterday, the divisions between diplomacy and military affairs were clearly demarcated, leaving no room for doubt. And the British and French front was consolidated, and even strengthened. As a result, the situation in Europe changed, no longer allowing for unilateral posturing. According to the philosophy of bloodshed, peace has been strengthened by one guarantee.</p>
<p>From now on, if there is no war, then so be it; if there is a war, it will be a great war. This has long been a common understanding among the people of the world, but autocratic countries, in addition to their lofty ambitions, have only now begun to recognize it, and only now are willing to recognize it. Because of this, in the past few days, the work of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was emphasized, focusing on complex diplomatic maneuvers, calculating friends and enemies. In the future, the work of the General Staff will be emphasized, focusing on planning strategies and estimating gains and losses. If the scope of gains and losses is limited to France and Italy, then military strength, material resources, personnel, and the overall situation each have their strengths and weaknesses. If the scope is Germany and Italy versus Britain and France, or even larger, then the entire picture changes. At the very least, it can be said that Germany and Italy are not as durable as Britain and France. Moreover, Germany does not really want to fight!</p>
<p>With such a situation, who would place a lone bet? I do not believe that a war is inevitable. However, there are still unknowns: Dictatorial regimes are based on establishing merit and prestige. This is the main factor driving militarism and is a cause for concern. Italy is close to the tropics, and its national character is emotional and impetuous. Moreover, it has been tempered by years of propaganda about grand achievements and disregard for others. This is the second cause for concern. In the Spanish Civil War, with the help of Italy, the victory is gradually being decided, and the front line is advancing towards the French border. Possible accidents are difficult to prevent, and planned provocations are also intended. This is the third cause for concern. Last September, Germany achieved a surprising victory over the Czech Republic. Italy was also quick to take action, spending a considerable amount of resources. There was likely an agreement that Germany had to repay the favor. This is the fourth cause for concern. Although the causes for concern are as such, the reasons against war are so great. It remains to be seen how Mr. Mussolini will wield his great diplomatic skills, prevent the causes for concern, avoid the reckless bet of war, and achieve honorable achievements in peace!</p>

<h3>Japanese Order Foreigners in Guling to Leave by a Deadline</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to Chinese sources, the Japanese army in northern Jiangxi Province has been continuously shelling Guling since the 3rd of this month. However, the Chinese army's defensive works have not been damaged at all. Because the Japanese army is attacking upwards, the shells they fire cannot reach their targets. The Japanese side notified the various foreign consulates on the 6th of this month, giving them until the 10th of this month to evacuate the residents of their respective countries on Guling, and threatened to launch a general attack on the Chinese army on the mountain from that day. However, the Chinese army has already built extremely strong defensive works and stored six months' worth of food. If the Japanese army dares to invade, it will surely fail. There are currently a total of 65 foreigners remaining on the mountain, including 37 British, 12 Americans, 9 Germans, and 7 other foreigners. (7th Quick News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: According to the Japanese military authorities here, there are still 65 foreigners in Guling. The Japanese consulate in Shanghai has notified the countries concerned, giving them until February 10 to withdraw. After the foreigners have withdrawn, the Japanese army will immediately begin a general attack. According to Japanese estimates, there are still about 5,000 Chinese troops on Guling. (7th Quick News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Hankou: The American gunboat Oahu is scheduled to depart from here at 9:00 AM tomorrow for Jiujiang. British Vice-Consul Eckersley and American Vice-Consul Davis will both be on board, it is reported that the ship will remain stationed in Jiujiang, to await the clarification of the situation in Guling, as the Japanese authorities have warned the foreigners in the mountains to evacuate. According to sources here, although instructions from the British and American governments regarding the evacuation of refugees from Guling have not yet been received, it is reported that the total evacuation of foreigners from Guling is a practical impossibility. The reason given is that most of the residents of Guling are elderly, and it is difficult to implement their hasty departure from the mountains. It is now reported that the Japanese side is considering this new situation. At present, although the British gunboat Petrel is still unable to make contact with Guling, news from the mountains indicates that all foreigners are safe and sound. (7th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Reporter Observes the Sino-Japanese War; Japan's Financial and Material Resources Are Exhausted; Military Victory Has Become a Delusion</h3>
<p>Berlin: The Frankfurter Zeitung recently published a telegram from its Tokyo correspondent, commenting on the situation after the resignation of former Japanese Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro. It said that Konoe proposed peace terms, but the Chinese government refused to discuss them. As a result, Konoe himself suffered a fatal blow and had to resign. The Sino-Japanese War has also entered a new stage as a result. The so-called new stage, on the Japanese side, means that "the Sino-Japanese situation has shifted from large-scale military operations to permanent occupation and suppression of guerrillas. Only by suppressing guerrillas and permanently securing the occupied areas can a way be found to establish a certain state, and then economic development can be planned." The success of this depends on how the Hiranuma Cabinet manages it. The cabinet still hopes to crush Chinese resistance and make it recognize Japan's position, but it also knows that the deeper the Japanese army goes, the less it will gain compared to occupying several important cities and strategic strongholds. For this reason, the Japanese military authorities have also recognized that the plan to open the Guangdong-Macau road to connect the Japanese troops in Hankou and Guangzhou is not necessary. Conversely, although peace cannot be established, it is eager to consolidate its strength in the occupied areas. However, this also requires a great deal of effort, because Japan's financial and material resources are limited. The current wartime economic policy must continue to be implemented, and the National Mobilization Law must be fully implemented to alleviate its poverty. (7th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Chinese War of Resistance is Growing - A Commentary from *Pravda*</h3>
<p>Moscow - The *Pravda* newspaper of Moscow recently published an article titled "The New China is Growing," stating that "China's war of resistance against foreign invaders, striving for national liberation, has entered its second phase. Japan's last attempt to encircle and annihilate China's main forces in Wuhan has completely failed. The Chinese army has increased in size, and its combat effectiveness has been infinitely strengthened. The 4,000-mile long battle line has made it difficult for Japan to advance. When the Japanese army reaches the mountainous areas, it can no longer coordinate the movements of the entire army. The Chinese army is now rapidly developing economic base areas in the Northwest and Southwest, preparing for a decisive counter-offensive. The brave Chinese people have unanimously risen up to fight for national liberation. In this process, they have greatly strengthened their political activities. The unity between the Chinese army and the people has become increasingly consolidated, and the foundation for long-term cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party has become increasingly strong. The Kuomintang's recent expulsion of pro-Japanese elements from the party was supported by the people of the whole country and was a very significant event, proving that the Kuomintang has resolutely decided to eliminate internal reactionaries and enter a new stage of the war of liberation."

<h3>Japanese Oppression of the Taiwanese and Korean People - Exploiting Wealth for Military Expenses, Enlisting Young Men as Cannon Fodder</h3>
<p>Tokyo - During yesterday's debate on the budget bill in the House of Representatives, a member of the Minseitō party, Nakajima, inquired about the attitudes of Korea and Taiwan towards the Sino-Japanese War. The spokesman for the Governor-General of Korea replied as follows: "The Korean people have now fully understood the great significance of the Sino-Japanese War and the Far Eastern situation and have completely abandoned the independence movement or communist conspiracies. Last year, 400 Korean volunteers joined the Korean army, and another 600 will enlist this year. The frugality movement in the area has been quite effective. Korean people's bank deposits have reached 200 million yen, and donations to the national defense fund total 6 million yen. There are also 64 airplanes." The spokesman for the Governor-General of Taiwan then replied, detailing how the Taiwanese people have been thoroughly Japanized, saying that "80% of the Taiwanese natives came from Fujian, and 20% came from Guangdong. In the early stages of the Sino-Japanese War, many rumors circulated among some Taiwanese people, saying that China would defeat Japan, or that Japan would be attacked by other countries. However, these rumors have now been completely eliminated. The Taiwanese people are now quite proud to be people of the Japanese Empire and to participate in the Sino-Japanese War. Some Taiwanese who died in battle in China were given honorable state funerals by the Emperor, just like the Japanese people. The frugality movement in Taiwan is progressing smoothly. The original target of 50 million yen has long been exceeded. The national defense funds contributed by the Taiwanese people have reached 7 million yen, including over 10,000 aborigines who sold gold worth 30 million yen to the Japanese government."

<h3>British Parliament Discusses Far East Events - Labour MP Asks About Economic Aid to China, Undersecretary Replies That Details Are Inconvenient to Disclose</h3>
<p>London - During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, the Export Credits Guarantee Department (Extension of Powers) Bill was passed at its third reading. The main content is to increase the guarantee amount of the department from £50 million to £70 million. During the discussion, Henderson, a Labour MP from the opposition party, asked the government whether the British government was prepared to satisfy the Chinese government's request for financial assistance in accordance with the resolution passed by the Council of the League of Nations on the 20th of last month. Undersecretary Butler immediately replied, "The Chinese government has made a suggestion, requesting economic assistance, which the British government is currently considering, but the details of which are not convenient to disclose at this time."

<h3>Japan Shows No Indication of Opening Navigation on the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers</h3>
<p>London - The issue of the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers was the subject of questioning in the House of Commons yesterday. Conservative MP Henderson asked if any indication had been received from the Japanese government regarding the opening of the Yangtze River. Undersecretary Butler replied that no indication had been received from the Japanese government regarding this matter since November 14th. The British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has continued to inform the Japanese Foreign Minister of evidence of Japanese business operations on the Yangtze River. Labour MP Alexander asked whether the British government agreed to this policy of obstructing British shipping. Undersecretary Butler replied, "We do not agree." Referring to the Pearl River, Conservative MP Masterton asked according to what regulations of international law the Japanese were preventing British ships from sailing on the Pearl River. Butler replied, "The Japanese claim that the Japanese army's operations on the Pearl River will be hindered by the actions of third-country ships." (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Negotiations on Qingdao's Refusal to Issue Licenses Have Not Been Successful</h3>
<p>London - The British House of Commons inquired yesterday about the Japanese authorities' implementation of export license measures. Conservative MP Morgen asked what measures the British Prime Minister Chamberlain had taken regarding the Japanese authorities in Qingdao refusing to allow the export of goods from foreign banks that provided financial facilities in Chinese currency. Undersecretary Butler replied that in recent months, the Japanese authorities in Qingdao had refused to issue export licenses, either for the reasons stated by Morgen or without stating any reasons. The British Consul-General in Qingdao has repeatedly negotiated with the Japanese side, but the Japanese side has used military necessity as an excuse and has not been successful. The British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, has also negotiated with the Japanese government on this matter. Morgen then asked whether this refusal to issue export licenses had been extended to other ports in China. Butler replied that this method has recently been extended to Weihaiwei and Yantai, and the British government is closely monitoring it. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>It Is Necessary to Improve the Burma Road to Yunnan</h3>
<p>London - Conservative MP Peter Macdonald asked in the House of Commons yesterday whether the Burmese government was supporting the improvement of the existing road to the border of Yunnan Province in China, and if not, whether it could be made into a modern standard road, as it would be a trade route to the Far East. Undersecretary of State for India, Lieutenant Colonel Muirhead, replied that the Burmese government had built this road from Lashio to the Chinese border, which is 120 miles long, and the project is sturdy and can be used regardless of the weather. Subsequent construction is underway as the road develops. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>

British shipping officials have asked the British Consul in Guangzhou to lodge a strong protest with the Japanese. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Uses Diplomatic Tactics to Conclude a Black Sea Pact - Wooing Romania, Turkey, Greece, and Bulgaria to Participate - Establishing Collective Security to Prevent German Advancement</h3>
<p>(Moscow) It is widely rumored in diplomatic circles here that the Soviet diplomatic authorities intend to initiate the conclusion of a Black Sea Pact, based on the three countries bordering the Black Sea, namely Romania, Turkey, and the Soviet Union. In addition, although Greece is not on the Black Sea coast, it should also be invited to participate. Bulgaria originally harbored the desire to "restore its homeland" from Romania. If the establishment of the Black Sea Pact makes it more likely for Bulgaria to realize this desire in the future, it will naturally be happy to join, provided that the country's aspirations are reduced to a minimum. It has recently been heard that the Soviet diplomatic authorities are conducting explorations to clarify whether there is hope for the realization of this plan. Generally speaking, the Soviet government advocates establishing a collective security system centered on the Black Sea, in order to prevent Germany from advancing further. It is still unclear whether the Soviet government has made this proposal to the countries concerned. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>The Anglo-French Cooperation Declaration - Rome Feels Uneasy - Believes It Has the Nature of a Military Alliance - Circles in Berlin Remain Silent</h3>
<p>(Rome) British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons regarding Anglo-French cooperation have shaken Italian political circles, who believe that Chamberlain has expressed a clearer position on the relationship between the Anglo-French treaty than before. Some quarters say that Chamberlain's remarks are equivalent to a declaration of an Anglo-French military alliance, with the same binding force as German Führer Hitler's declaration of the relationship between Germany and Italy. Many political observers believe that the British Prime Minister's remarks have broken Italy's belief that Britain has never given France military assistance. Italian sources believe that French Prime Minister Daladier said after the Munich Agreement that Britain had given such guarantees, which were rejected by Chamberlain, but now Daladier's movement has been successful. Italian officials are unwilling to make criticisms, but say that Italy's natural desire does not harm the military interests of any country. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) This morning, all the newspapers here published editorials, trying hard to reduce the value of British Prime Minister Chamberlain's declaration in the House of Commons yesterday that Britain and France would provide each other with military assistance in the event of war. It is said that Britain made these remarks in response to France's pressure, and that their meaning is no different from previous remarks. The newspapers also emphasized that the Prime Minister's remarks were about wars involving Britain and France, not wars in general, and made great efforts to elaborate on this point. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) There has been much silence here regarding British Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons regarding Anglo-French cooperation, and no criticism has been made. A spokesman told a Reuters reporter that the Prime Minister's remarks were not new, and that the Prime Minister had given France the same guarantee when the situation in Czechoslovakia was critical. Future events will depend on whether Chamberlain's remarks can strengthen France's attitude. If France's attitude becomes stronger as a result, the existing tension will increase. Some critics have said that Chamberlain's guarantee to France is similar to the guarantee given by Germany to Italy. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>Paris Is Pleased</h3>
<p>(Paris) Responsible figures here are very satisfied after British Prime Minister Chamberlain made a speech in the House of Commons, declaring that if France were threatened, "no matter where the threat comes from," it should assist France, and said that up to now, Britain has only agreed to assist France if it is attacked by Germany. According to the speech made by Prime Minister Chamberlain today, if France is threatened in the Pyrenees Mountains, Britain is also obliged to assist it, which is a further indication. In addition, the French government authorities have repeatedly made declarations in the Chamber of Deputies, declaring that France will never give up an inch of land, and Prime Minister Chamberlain has also agreed with this. How Britain is positioned has therefore become completely clear, and this is even more satisfying. In addition, the British and French governments have also been in close contact before Prime Minister Chamberlain issued this statement, asking General Franco, the commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist Army, to provide assurances that he will not allow Italian troops to approach the French border. This also shows the solidarity between Britain and France. After reading the communiqué issued by the Supreme Council of the Italian Fascist Party some days ago, it is known that even after the Spanish Nationalist Army wins, Italian volunteers do not want to withdraw, so that they can have a better chance of success when making demands on France in the future. On the other hand, there is also the saying that the western Spanish island of Menorca in the Mediterranean Sea will be occupied by Italy after Mallorca. If so, then Italy's position in Mallorca will definitely be strengthened, which is a very worrying thing. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union and Italy Negotiate a Trade Agreement - Raw Materials Exchanged for Industrial Products - Actual Negotiations Have Been Completed</h3>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official Italian newspaper *Il Popolo d'Italia* recently reported that trade negotiations between Italy and the Soviet Union have been underway for several weeks, and have actually been completed. The scale of the agreement is the largest in Italy's past trade agreements with the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union will supply Italy with heavy oil, manganese, coal, wheat, and wood, and Italy will provide industrial manufactured goods. It is estimated that the annual trade volume between the two sides will increase from 400,000,000 lira to 1,000,000,000 lira, and a barter system will be applied. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>The Interests of Hungarian Nationals in the Soviet Union - Entrusted to Japan for Care</h3>
<p>(Moscow) After the Soviet Union severed diplomatic relations with Hungary, the staff of the Hungarian Embassy have been ordered to return home. The interests of the country's nationals have been entrusted to the Japanese Embassy for care. Before his departure, Hungarian Minister Ronggert also asked the Japanese Embassy authorities to handle the closing of the Hungarian Embassy. The Japanese Embassy has recently declared that it will temporarily take care of the interests of Hungarian nationals until the diplomatic representative of a third country formally accepts the Hungarian mandate to handle consular affairs. Regarding this matter, it is generally believed that diplomatic representatives of various countries regard this Hungarian mandate as a difficult task. Poland and Hungary maintain friendly relations and could have accepted the Hungarian mandate, but relations between Poland and the Soviet Union have recently improved significantly, and the two sides are conducting negotiations to discuss the signing of a trade agreement. Poland does not want to offend the Soviet Union by taking care of the interests of Hungarian nationals under such circumstances. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Britain and France Make Contact - Trying to Mediate the Spanish Civil War - Rumors of a Tendency to Recognize the Rebel Government - Peace Terms Rejected by Franco</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to news reports, Berat, the unofficial French ambassador to the Nationalist Spanish capital, visited the Nationalist Foreign Minister in Burgos twice yesterday. Today he is heading back to France to meet with French Foreign Minister Bonnet. At the same time, there are rumors that British Minister to Spain Stevenson, French Ambassador Henry, and Spanish Republican Foreign Minister Vayo met in Perpignan. Therefore, the general public believes that this recent development may lead to hope for peace. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) It is claimed here that the British and French governments have now taken steps to try to end the Spanish war. Responsible figures are keeping silent on this matter. Regarding rumors that the Spanish government has asked Britain to intervene and explained to Downing Street the conditions under which the Spanish government is willing to end the war immediately, the authorities here neither deny nor confirm this. London newspapers reported yesterday that Franco rejected any truce conditions, insisting on the unconditional surrender of the government forces. Political figures believe that this news is probably reliable. London is now actively contacting Paris on this matter, trying to avoid further pointless bloodshed. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Perpignan - Spanish Republican Foreign Minister Vayo met with British Minister Stevenson and French Ambassador Henry this afternoon. Before the meeting, reporters visited British Minister Stevenson at the British Embassy in Amélies-les-Bains. Stevenson denied that Republican Prime Minister Negrín had asked him to discuss peace terms with General Franco, saying that this was contrary to Negrín's declared will to continue the war in central Spain. However, he added, "Since I arrived in Spain in October, I have been trying to find a way to peace. I have not yet discussed this with the Spanish government. Henry and I will meet with Vayo in Perpignan this afternoon. That's all I can say for now." (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) Britain and France once attempted to mediate the Spanish war, but because the conditions were not met by either side, and neither side was willing to surrender, peace hopes have not yet been realized today. Rebel leader General Franco insisted that the government forces surrender unconditionally. Within the Spanish Republican government, opinions are divided into two factions. Republican President Azaña fled to Paris yesterday, advocating unconditional surrender to avoid prolonging the war, but government military officials opposed his proposal. Republican Prime Minister Negrín and Foreign Minister Vayo proposed a three-point peace plan, supported the military's proposal, and believed that the war should continue, but this was rejected by Franco. The peace plan proposed by the government military required that all foreign troops in Spain should withdraw first, and then a public vote should be held to determine the future Spanish government, and that an agreement should be concluded by both sides, with no retaliatory actions. (Associated Press dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) It is widely rumored here today that the British and French governments will convene a meeting soon to discuss the recent situation in Spain. It is said that London and Paris now both hope to establish diplomatic relations with Franco immediately. The *Daily News* revealed that if the Spanish Nationalist Army government ceases hostilities immediately, Britain will recognize it. An editorial in the *Daily Mail* urged General Miaja not to continue resisting to avoid pointless bloodshed. The newspaper stated, "Britain and France will formally recognize Franco within 24 hours." (Haitong dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Perpignan - Regarding the French dispatch of a diplomatic representative to Burgos, it is still unknown to the outside world whether it will actually or legally recognize the Franco government. People here point out that if France legally recognizes the Franco government, it will inevitably sever all relations with the Spanish government. (Haitong dispatch, 7th)</p>
<h3>British and French Representatives Make Contact - Britain Makes Three Proposals to the Rebel Authorities</h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed sources have announced that Sir Robert Hodgson, the British commercial representative stationed in Burgos (the seat of the Nationalist Army government), is scheduled to return to his post within the next week. He will spend a week in Paris on the way, and will talk with British Ambassador to Spain Chilton in Antibes in southern France, before proceeding to Burgos. This trip has three missions: (1) to continue negotiations in the hope of ending the Spanish Civil War; (2) to urge the Nationalist Army government to provide assurances that Italian volunteers will be withdrawn after the end of the civil war; and (3) to suggest to the Nationalist Army government that Britain provide funds to help with reconstruction work. Regarding the first point, General Franco has given British Acting Commercial Representative Coulum a promise that he will avoid bloody retaliatory actions after the end of the civil war. Regarding the second point, France has asked the Nationalist Army government not to allow Italian volunteers to approach the French border, and British Acting Commercial Representative Coulum has also made the same request to the Nationalist Army government, but no answer has been received. It is rumored that the British government intends to send a senior official to Burgos in the near future, whose status is even higher than that of Sir Robert Hodgson, and then formally recognize the Nationalist Army government. Regarding the third point, there are three main conditions for Britain: (a) this loan will be guaranteed by Spanish tariff revenue; (b) the Nationalist Army agrees to send foreign combatants back to their home countries and recognizes Britain's position in Gibraltar; and (c) the Nationalist Army will compensate British ships that have been destroyed by Nationalist Army aircraft in ports controlled by the Spanish Republican government. In addition, Britain can provide short-term credit loans to Spain to purchase various raw materials, but most of the goods needed by Spain should be ordered from Britain. Also, credit loans will not be given to industries in Spain that employ German and Italian technical personnel. In short, the purpose of the above loan is to enable the Spanish Nationalist Army to repay its debts to Italy, so as to eliminate Italian influence and replace it with British influence. Once Sir Robert Hodgson returns to Burgos, he will explain to General Franco the need for the Nationalist Army government to maintain friendly relations with Britain and France, and will again urge the repatriation of Italian volunteers. However, the semi-official Italian newspaper *Il Popolo d'Italia* recently published an article stating that Italian volunteers can only be withdrawn after the Spanish Nationalist Army has achieved complete victory in both military and political aspects, which is quite worrying. The British government has ordered British Ambassador to Italy Sir Percy Loraine to inquire about the views of the Italian government and to draw its attention to the obligations contained in the Anglo-Italian Agreement.

<p>San Sebastián, Spain - French moderate Senator Bérard arrived in Burgos this evening. After a short rest, he visited Spanish Academy Secretary Torres to discuss the issue of transporting valuable Spanish works of art into France for safe preservation. He is scheduled to return to Paris tomorrow morning to report to Foreign Minister Bonnet on his trip and talks with the Spanish Nationalist Army authorities. In addition, many members of the French Parliament arrived in Burgos and Barcelona today to conduct inspections. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Internal Disagreement Among Various Western Communist Governments Regarding Peace or War</h3>
<p>(Paris) This morning, various newspapers here confirmed that the Spanish Prime Minister Negrín had briefly visited French territory and has now returned to Spain. (Hai Tong Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Based on recent reports from various sources, the internal situation in Spain appears to be quite complex. The President of the Spanish Republic, Azaña, and Prime Minister Negrín hold differing views on the issue of peace or war. In other words, President Azaña advocates for reconciliation with the Nationalist forces, while Prime Minister Negrín insists on continuing the war, regardless of success or failure. President Azaña's flight to France was unanimously endorsed by his cabinet members. Prime Minister Negrín even escorted him to the French border before returning to the autonomous region of Catalonia to reorganize the army and continue the war. Currently, apart from the militia, very few of the national army soldiers have fled to France. President Azaña is now staying at the home of a relative in Longchamps, Voix province, and is expected to arrive here shortly. (Havas Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>Belbinan According to the Spanish News Agency, Spanish Republican Prime Minister Negrín visited northern Catalonia to inspect the Republican army lines along the Ter River. He expressed great satisfaction with the high morale of the Republican soldiers who are currently engaged in rear-guard actions. Military experts in Belbinan believe that the Nationalist forces are too far from their supply lines, resulting in logistical difficulties. The Republican army has thus obtained a welcome respite to rearrange its lines. It is widely believed that the Republican army may mount a final resistance in the Puigcerdà area.

<p>(London) It is reported here that Spanish President Azaña has been secretly working towards peace for several months. He recently visited a village on the Swiss border to see his brother-in-law, the former Spanish Consul-General in Geneva, Rivas Cherif. (Reuters Telegraph, 7th)</p>

<h3>Italian Troops Will Not Withdraw from Spain Until Political Victory Achieved, Paving the Way for Demands on France, The United States Worries About the Future of the European Situation</h3>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the Spanish question, well-informed sources within the Fascist Party recently declared that even if the resistance of the Spanish government forces is completely broken, it is not certain that the Italian army units will remain stationed in Spanish territory. The reason is that after French Senator Bérard's activities in Burgos, Spain, General Franco, Commander-in-Chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces, may be influenced by French power, which must be dealt with. In this way, the stationing of Italian troops in Spain has two advantages. Firstly, Italy's strategic and diplomatic position will be strengthened when it makes demands on France in the future. Secondly, the diplomatic orientation of the Spanish Nationalist government will be guaranteed; in other words, the Nationalist government will not establish friendly relations with France. Italy is aware that all this is inconsistent with the promises made by Prime Minister Mussolini to Prime Minister Chamberlain. The semi-official Italian newspaper, *Il Popolo d'Italia*, stated yesterday that after achieving military victory, the Spanish Nationalist forces must also achieve a complete political victory, implying that it intends to pave the way for Italian troops to remain stationed in Spain. (Havas Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<p>(New York) After the well-known Italian journalist Gayda published an article the day before yesterday, the United States felt uneasy. Gayda stated that Italian volunteers in Spain must wait until the Spanish Nationalist forces achieve political victory in addition to military victory before they can be withdrawn. This is a new explanation of Italy's attitude towards Spain. American newspapers are all asking what kind of impact the collapse of the Spanish Republican government will have. The *New York Times* reported that British Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday, explaining the close relationship between Britain and France, indicating that the British government attaches great importance to Gayda's above-mentioned statement. The *New York Post* stated that the strength of the Spanish Republican government is dwindling, and its remaining forces on the northern Catalan front are being depleted on the roads leading to Perpignan in southern France.

<h3>Spanish Rebel Army Advances Victoriously Along the Coast, Striving to Capture the Entire Region of Catalonia</h3>
<p>Salamanca After the resistance of the Spanish government forces in Catalonia completely collapsed, General Franco is now engaged in encircling and suppressing the remaining government troops. The Nationalist forces on the coastal front in the Girona area have recently established positions on the left bank of the Tana River to control key points. Nationalist planes yesterday bombed Alicante and Cartagena, destroying one government cruiser and one destroyer each. Figueras also suffered considerable damage from multiple bombing raids. The Nationalist forces operating in the Puigcerdà area are advancing rapidly eastward along the Berga Highway, gradually approaching the French border. Despite the poor weather yesterday, the Nationalist forces continued to make progress, capturing many rugged mountainous areas. The Nationalist forces along the coast have already crossed Palamos and are advancing eastward towards Bisbal. This alone clearly demonstrates General Franco's strategy to capture the entire region of Catalonia. (Hai Tong Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<h3>Tens of Thousands of Refugees Cross the Border into France in Crowds, the Scene of Supporting the Old and Carrying the Young is Extremely Miserable, Soldiers are Disarmed and Sent to Detention Camps</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to official statements, 40,000 Spanish refugees and soldiers have crossed the border into France in the past 24 hours. (Reuters Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>Belbinan Nationalist forces have reached the outskirts of Andulas. It is estimated that 50,000 to 60,000 government troops are entering France every hour. (Reuters Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to an agreement negotiated between representatives of the French government and the Spanish government, the Spanish government militia began withdrawing into French territory from the village of Perthus this morning, in batches of 5,000. They were escorted into the country by French army gendarmes, disarmed, and then taken to concentration camps in Le Boulou and Arles-sur-Tech. The Spanish militiamen entering the country looked miserable as they were escorted by the French army, which saddened onlookers. The total strength of the Spanish forces on the French-Spanish border is approximately 110,000 to 120,000, of which 90,000 have retreated into French territory in Perthus, Cerbère, and Maureillas-las-Illas. The remaining 20,000 to 30,000 are still in the Spanish territories of Bellver and Ripoll, continuing to mount a final resistance. (Hai Tong Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>La Bourboule Long lines of Spanish refugees are crossing the border into France. Exhausted and hungry, they struggle to walk. The roadside trenches two miles outside the border are full of all kinds of military equipment, as Republican army deserters abandon machine guns, light machine guns, heavy pistols, and other firearms by the roadside and flee. (Reuters Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to official sources, no less than 130,000 Spanish women, children, and elderly have sought refuge in France in the past week. 110,000 of them have already been sent by the authorities to designated locations for accommodation. The government authorities expect that in the coming days, another 100,000 to 140,000 Spanish refugees and soldiers will continue to arrive in France. The total number of Spanish refugees in France will then increase sharply to 300,000. To accommodate these refugees, the authorities have established reception centers in various parts of the interior. Soldiers and able-bodied men among the refugees are sent to a large detention camp in Algiers, which can accommodate 100,000 people. So far, the Spanish refugees have been able to maintain discipline and no incidents have occurred. (Havas Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<h3>Opposition to President Roosevelt's Foreign Policy in Congress, the Momentum of the Opposition is Not Great</h3>
<p>(Washington) The movement in Congress opposing President Roosevelt's aid to Britain and France to rearm has suffered a slight setback today. Although isolationist Republicans and conservative Democrats have tried their best to attack President Roosevelt, prominent Republicans are clearly unwilling to criticize the government's foreign policy. This is because the government's military preparedness plan and foreign policy have made a very good impression on the public, making it inconvenient to oppose them. The Senate has now adjourned and will resume debate on foreign policy issues on Thursday. (Associated Press Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<h3>Pittman Agrees to Stop Shipping Military Materials to Japan, Which Will Help Amend the Neutrality Act</h3>
<p>(Washington) Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Pittman said today that he fully agrees with the Secretary of State's recommendation that merchants voluntarily stop exporting aircraft. "Japan has violated the Nine-Power Treaty, and I believe that we should not supply military materials to countries that violate treaties." Pittman's remarks are highly relevant to the current efforts in Congress to amend the Neutrality Act, and can at least provide a legal basis for President Roosevelt's tough actions against aggressor nations. At the same time, observers believe that even if the Neutrality Act is not amended, the voluntary cessation of arms exports by American merchants can also have a real effect. On the one hand, President Roosevelt's plan to help Britain and France rearm has kept the British arms industry busy, leaving no spare capacity to work for aggressor nations. Furthermore, the same voluntary cessation method can be applied to other arms industries besides aircraft. (Associated Press Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<h3>Italian Supreme Defense Council to Discuss Reorganizing Military and Economic Institutions, Appointed a Committee to Draft Wartime Organization Law</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Supreme Defense Council will meet at 4 pm today to discuss the reorganization of national military and economic institutions. (Hai Tong Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government has appointed an advisory committee to discuss and draft a wartime organization law and a neutrality organization law. The committee held its first meeting yesterday, which was personally attended by Prime Minister Mussolini, who delivered a speech explaining the reasons for the Fascist government's drafting of the new wartime organization law. He stated that although Italy intends to take into account various international conventions related to the methods of using various armed forces, they have long been ignored in practice. Therefore, Italy should formulate a complete set of laws regarding war and neutrality within a short period of time, and its content will be more comprehensive than that of other countries. (Havas Telegraph, 8th)</p>
<h3>Dutch Foreign Minister Advocates Improving Relations with Germany</h3>
<p>The Hague Foreign Minister Patijn recently submitted a summary to the Upper House, strongly arguing that the Netherlands needs to maintain good relations with Germany. If the major powers are not determined to maintain international order according to law, the Dutch foreign policy should not be based on the League of Nations. As for Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, in addition to containing various sanctions, it also stipulates that member states' troops should be provided with transit facilities if they resist aggressor nations in accordance with the Covenant. In the Netherlands, if a neighboring country becomes an aggressor nation, it must refuse foreign troops to pass through its territory to assist the invaded country, because the passage of foreign troops is very likely to cause war and cause the Netherlands to become a battlefield. Regarding the relationship between the Netherlands and Germany, German leader Hitler stated in a speech on January 30th that Germany is willing to maintain good relations with the Netherlands. The Dutch government should also avoid any actions that may hinder this good relationship. When the Dutch people criticize the international situation, they must do so with a moderate attitude, otherwise, the harm it causes may be beyond their imagination. "At this time, ideological tendencies and political tendencies are intertwined and mutually agitated. If we want to restore normal relations between nations, we must be moderate." The Dutch nation greatly admires Germany's efforts to improve itself and its national strength since the European War. As for the Dutch Jews residing in Germany, the government cares about these Jews just as it cares about other overseas Chinese. So far, it is fortunate that no Dutch Jews have had their property confiscated or been deported by the German government. (Havas Telegraph, 6th)</p>
<h3>Opening of the Palestine Conference at St. James's Palace, British Prime Minister Chamberlain Delivers a Welcome Speech, Hoping for Understanding Between Arab and Jewish Nations to Lay the Foundation for Peace</h3>
<p>(London) The Palestine conference opened at 10:30 this morning at St. James's Palace. According to the scheduled procedure, British representatives first spoke with Arab representatives and then with Jewish representatives. In addition to Prime Minister Chamberlain, the chairman of the conference, British attendees today included Foreign Secretary Halifax, Under-Secretary Butler, and Colonial Secretary MacDonald. On the Arab side, in addition to the absence of "moderate" representatives, the attendees included representatives from Egypt, Iraq, Yemen, Transjordan, and local Palestinian Arab representatives. Prime Minister Chamberlain delivered a speech, saying that he welcomed the political leaders of the Arab people of Palestine and the representatives of neighboring countries. "It is even more gratifying that these countries are willing to cooperate with us to seek a wise solution to the current difficulties to protect the rights and status of the Arab people of Palestine. This discussion should be thorough, frank, and free, in order to achieve the most satisfactory result. In order to conform to this principle, the British representatives do not want to be the first to propose any scope of discussion, nor do they offer their own opinions, so that the Arab and Jewish nations can have a full opportunity to explain their wishes." In short, what Britain seeks is to maintain peace and hopes that a permanent foundation of peace can be laid in Palestine as soon as possible. "Gathering together today is the first major step in establishing a relationship of understanding. It is important to know that although our current responsibilities are difficult, if we can work together harmoniously, everything will be solved easily. It is hoped that those who are present today will concentrate their energy and spirit, conduct a precise and accurate review of the actual problems of the current situation and the main circumstances of various facts, and respect and understand each other's situations and views. Eventually, they will understand and complement each other," he said. Prince Muhammad Abdu Munam, the chief representative of Egypt, immediately gave a reply, saying that he hopes that security can be restored in Palestine and that various current issues can be resolved in a friendly manner. (Havas Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The Arab delegation, composed of representatives of the Grand Mufti and representatives of various countries around Palestine, was previously received by Chamberlain in the Queen Anne drawing-room, the famous one leading to the venue. The British side tried its best to separate the representatives of both sides attending the meeting to avoid conflict, because the Arabs refused to sit in the same place as the Jews. Therefore, the British Prime Minister met the Jewish delegation alone in the banquet hall on the other side of the venue. (Reuters Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Arab Higher Committee Drafted a Proposal Containing Four Demands, The Two Arab Delegations Show No Possibility of Approaching Each Other</h3>
<p>(London) Representatives of the Arab Higher Committee are now engaged in final preparations to formulate demands to be submitted to the Palestine Conference opening here tomorrow. In short, their demands are the following: (1) Recognition of Palestine's complete independence; (2) Replacement of the mandate system with a treaty; (3) Abolition of the Balfour Declaration; (4) Immediate cessation of Jewish immigration. The representatives have received many telegrams from groups in Egypt and Palestine, especially emphasizing the following two points: (1) Self-Defense Party representatives can only speak for their own party; (2) The Higher Committee is the only group representing Palestine. Therefore, the telegrams have made the Grand Mufti Party's attitude towards the Self-Defense Party even tougher, and the possibility of the two Arab delegations approaching each other seems hopeless at present. At the same time, the Indian Muslim League has telegraphed its London representative to provide assistance to the Arab demands and issued a statement of sympathy and support for Palestine's independence demands. A copy of the statement has been submitted to the Secretary of State for India, who promised to convey the contents of the statement to the government. Nashashibi, the chief representative of the Arab Self-Defense Party, recently told a Reuters interviewer that he should feel that the British government is indeed genuinely intending to establish peace in Palestine. The Self-Defense Party delegation is willing to accept any proposal that can promote Palestine's independence. The party represents at least 75% of Palestine's important interests and represents more than 50% of the people. Regardless of the outcome, the Self-Defense Party delegation will pretend to be a country and do what it should do, without involving personal ambitions. The Self-Defense Party will fully cooperate with the government in order to obtain a solution. According to news last night, the Jewish permanent negotiation delegation includes Weizmann, Brodetsky, Grian, Hertock, and Goldman, and other representatives will assist from time to time.

<h3>Arabs Declare a Three-Day Strike, Crowding the Grand Mufti</h3>
<p>Jerusalem Well-informed observers view the three-day strike announced yesterday in Jerusalem and other parts of Palestine as a very cunning movement to crowd the Grand Mufti. The purpose is self-evident, which is to oppose the delegation of the Arab Self-Defense Party led by Nashashibi to London. The organizers of the strike did not show their hand until the delegation departed for London, so that Nashashibi's accomplices were still unable to defend themselves due to fear of resistance. This movement also shows the British government that the Arab people are united and willing to be behind the Grand Mufti. The English accountant of the Palestine Railway Haifa Station, Mr. Yang, was shot and slightly injured yesterday. Not long after, a Jewish bus was ambushed, killing one person and injuring five others. In addition, a loan car near Lydda derailed. Because of this, the military commander has banned Arab trade exports and imports in Jaffa until the section of track is repaired. (Reuters Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<h3>Death of the King of Baroda, India, Reigned for Sixty-Three Years</h3>
<p>Bombay The King of Baroda, India, Gaekwar, passed away today at an advanced age of 75. The Queen and the Crown Prince were by his side when he passed away. The King ascended the throne in May 1875, when he was only 12 years old. Over the past sixty-three years, the King has been the most enlightened of the Indian native kings, promoting education with tireless efforts. The free and compulsory education system in India was first implemented by the King. The King's wealth ranks third among the Indian native kings, with an average annual income of more than 2 million pounds. (The other two wealthy kings are the ruler of Hyderabad State, with an annual income of 6.5 million pounds, and the King of Mysore, with an annual income of 3 million pounds).

<h3>Burma Will Have a New National Flag</h3>
<p>(London) Burma will soon have its own national flag, and in accordance with the status allowed by the British government after separating from India in 1937, it will become an autonomous unit of the British Empire. The Burmese national flag has a blue background, with the British national flag in the upper left corner and a peacock in the right half, drawn in gold. The peacock pattern is taken from the silver coins cast and issued during the reign of King Mindon in 1852. Since 1852, the peacock has implicitly become the national emblem of Burma.

<h3>Uprising of the Puppet Army in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>(Huaiyin) The Japanese army in Xuzhou attacked east in three routes, all forcing their way to the west bank of the Jun River. After Xu Miaokun led more than a thousand troops to revolt, the puppet troops of Li Guanying on the northern route disintegrated. The troops of Liu Fulong in Nanjing also began to brew an uprising and are now showing signs of collapse. Only the Japanese army on the central route still intends to attack east alone to cover the Longhai Railway, but they have been blocked head-on by the Chinese army. The bandits and puppet troops were supplied by the Japanese army with a large number of bullets, clothing, cash, and military maps. Li and Liu, the rebels, were unable to support their troops because Wang and others in their troops fled to Tianjin with the money. The Japanese army suffered a huge deception and does not trust the puppet organizations. Xu Yankun has now led his troops to Huaiyin to report on the events, and the authorities have given him a special reward. (Telegraph, 7th)</p>

The Japanese army has recently set up artillery positions on the highlands near Xinkaitang, with a machine gun unit attached. The Xinkaitang station and its eastern strongholds are still under strict guard. It seems that the Japanese army has been strengthening stronghold fortifications, building transportation routes, and frequently exchanging troops to confuse the Chinese. (Telegraph, 7th)</p>

<h3>Wei County, Hebei, Lost and Recovered</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) The Japanese army in Pingxiang launched an attack on Wei County defended by the Chinese army on the morning of the 2nd. They fought fiercely with the Chinese army all day. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties. Due to insufficient strength, the Chinese army withdrew automatically, and Wei County fell. Until the evening, the main force of the Chinese army arrived and immediately launched a counterattack against the Japanese army. The fighting was very fierce, and the Japanese army was killed in even greater numbers. The Japanese army collapsed and retreated westward. The Chinese army sent a team to attack on the one hand and recover Wei County on the other. The spoils seized are being cleared. In addition, the Japanese army, which had been making troubles in Changhe Town, east of Pingxiang, actually wore Chinese army uniforms and held Chinese army flags, trying to confuse the Chinese army. The Japanese army's despicable behavior is so great! (Telegraph, 6th)</p>

In addition to establishing six emergency hospitals throughout the city to care for the wounded, the Air Defense Headquarters also plans to build "fire lanes" in densely populated areas of the city to prevent the spread of flames. (Reuters dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Recently, the government, fearing the tragedy of the bombings in Guiyang and Wanxian, has continued to implement the forced evacuation of civilians in Chongqing. Wives and children of government officials are also considered civilians. Police in Detroit have placed sandbags outside each household and shop for firefighting purposes. Bomb shelters have also been built in many open spaces and private gardens. After the fall of Hankou, the original population of Chongqing was 600,000. Thirty thousand women and children from Chongqing go to the suburbs every day for temporary refuge. The National Relief Commission has already established six temporary hospitals to prepare for the indiscriminate bombing by Japanese planes. However, government officials and the general public are very calm, and the market is as usual. (Associated Press dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<h3>From Chongqing to Chengdu: The Chengdu-Chongqing Railway is Under Construction, Neijiang Produces Extremely Abundant Sugar</h3>
<p>Chengdu Correspondence, Xikang is located in the western frontier and possesses wealth surpassing the southwest. The central government, in an effort to develop it, specifically established the Xikang Provincial Construction Committee in Kangding in the 24th year of the Republic [1935]. Three years later, preparations were completed, and the newly appointed members of the Xikang Provincial Committee gathered in Kangding. On New Year's Day of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], the provincial government establishment ceremony was held. After the fall of the capital, the reporter rushed to the war zone, traversing six provinces for nearly a year. After the abandonment of Wuhan, I escaped to Chongqing. Now that the second phase of the War of Resistance has begun, the development of the southwest cannot be delayed. Xikang is a virgin land in the southwest, and before its development, it is urgently necessary for Chinese people to go and investigate in order to understand it. Therefore, I decided to go to the province to carry out investigation work, and incidentally inspect the Sichuan border, and make the findings public to the people of the country, so that it can serve as a means of production. On the morning of December 26th, the reporter took a long-distance bus from the Sichuan Highway Bureau from Chongqing, and set off west along the Chengdu-Chongqing highway. The situation seen along the way is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Departing from Chongqing In recent months, the Sichuan Highway Bureau has seen an increasing number of passengers traveling west by bus. In order to maintain order, it has specifically stipulated that passengers must pre-register and pre-purchase tickets, and board the bus in order. The reporter purchased a ticket and waited for as long as twelve days before finally boarding the bus on the morning of the 26th. There were more than twenty passengers, sitting in rows of five according to their assigned seats, and the seats were small and crowded. At eight o'clock, the bus departed from the Chongqing station. At that time, the cold wind was sharp, and the cloudy sky was misty. The entire city of Chongqing was shrouded in thin clouds and thick fog. Due to the continuous rainy days, the road was muddy. The bus sped along the road, splashing cement everywhere. In the suburbs, green trees and bamboo leaned against the villages and hills. Along the way, diligent and simple villagers carried goods to the market in an endless stream. When the bus arrived at Xiaolongkan Station, soldiers came forward to check the passenger manifest. Further ahead, the road gradually entered mountainous terrain. The highway was built along the mountainside, and the bus sped around the mountains. Sometimes it spiraled upwards, sometimes it meandered downwards. Sometimes traveling on the ridge, sometimes driving at the foot of the mountain. Rice paddies and villages were all within sight. It is said that this section of the mountain road was built by German engineers in those years. The project was arduous and took a long time to complete. After passing Qingmuguan, the highway gradually became flat. Many workers were seen doing earthwork and crushing stones on the roadbed of the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway. The bus passed through Bishan County and then arrived at Laifengyi Station. The driver and passengers got off the bus and had lunch in a small restaurant. After the meal, the bus continued to move forward. After passing Yongchuan, a female passenger got off the bus. When arriving at Anfu Town, it was heard from the station staff that Japanese planes attacked Sichuan and bombed Hechuan County. When the bus passed through the territory of Longchang County, male and female elementary school students stopped the bus on the highway to solicit donations for national salvation. At about 3 p.m., the bus arrived at Beimu Town and transferred to a ferry to cross the river. In the heart of the river, there were iron bridge piers built by the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway Bureau, totaling five spans. The bridge deck materials have been transported, and the bridge will be erected next year. At about 4 p.m., the bus arrived at Neijiang County, and the passengers got off the bus. Stayed there that night.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Neijiang Neijiang is a relatively prosperous county in southern Sichuan. Although the urban area is not large, the roads are clean and tidy, and the city buildings are prosperous. Commerce surpasses neighboring counties. The reporter and two middle school students from Chengdu, who were colleagues, stayed at the Wansheng Hotel on Jiaotong East Road. After washing up, I went out to the main street for a tour. I saw electric lights shining brightly and pedestrians bustling about. The most lively place in the county is Zhongshan Road. There are bookstores selling new culture medical books and sound movie theaters. There are several banks and all kinds of other shops. Tea houses are especially numerous. The reporter then went to the county government to visit County Chief Luo Rongli. Luo was out on business, and Secretary Yao Songshou received him. When asked about the local situation, he said that the total population of Neijiang County is about 500,000, and the urban area accounts for one-tenth. There are a total of more than 400 elementary schools. The county seat has a junior high school. The main product is sugarcane. Due to the widespread planting, the production of rice is relatively small, and it is not enough to meet the demand for food. It all depends on the supply from other counties. Because the county produces a large amount of sugarcane, the output of sugar is also large. However, the cracking method is still the old method. It seems that new methods should be used to improve it in order to seek large-scale production and sales. There are five banks here: China, Juxingcheng, Chuan Salt, Chongqing, and Chuan Kang. In addition, there is the Neijiang Local Court located in the county government. The national salvation organization has a mobilization committee, and the people's anti-war emotions are strong. Then returned to the residence to sleep. The next morning (December 27) at 7:30, take a bus to Chengdu.</p>
<p>Arriving in Chengdu It is well known that Sichuan Province has layers of mountains and dangerous roads. However, the Chengdu-Chongqing line only has undulating hills and uneven mounds, not like the high mountains and large mountains of eastern Sichuan, which are continuous and towering. Therefore, most of the Chengdu-Chongqing highway is flat and easy to travel. After the bus departed from Neijiang, it turned northwest and drove forward. There are many sugar canes in the fields on both sides of the road, and farmers are harvesting. There are piles of sugarcane leaves exposed on the road, ready for use as fuel for livestock. Further west, the roadbed is uneven. Because the slope goes up and down, the bus travels sometimes slowly and sometimes quickly. In addition to the patches of sugarcane in the fields, there are wheat and broad beans, peas, radishes and other crops. Entering the territory of Zizhong County, there are more and more sugar canes. At about 10 o'clock, the bus arrived at Qiuxi River, where it had lunch. After the meal, continued to move forward. Arrived at Linjiang Temple in Ziyang for a rest and to repair the machinery. At 2 p.m., the bus arrived at Luohai Township in Jianyang County. The bus engine suddenly broke down, and the passengers all got off the bus. The workers repaired it for about an hour before continuing to drive. After the bus passed Chadianzi, it gradually entered the mountains. The highway winds and the bus moves forward in twists and turns, sometimes along the mountainside, sometimes around the mountains. It turns and turns, and finally reaches the top of the mountain. Looking down from the window, the abyss is deep and secluded, which is frightening. At that time, the evening smoke rises everywhere, and the twilight is vast. The bus passed Longquanyi, and the night had already begun. Looking at the lights of Chengdu in the distance, I knew that arrival was imminent. At 5:40, the bus arrived at the East Outer Station and stopped. The two-day journey came to an end. The reporter plans to rest in Chengdu for a few days and then go to Kangding.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Military Commanders Hold Guerrilla Warfare Meeting</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence, Zhang Fakui, commander of the Fourth War Zone, completed his inspection of the northeastern Jiangxi war zone. On the 25th, he held a conference of commanding officers in charge of guerrilla warfare throughout the province in Wengyuan to discuss the names, organization, funding, and weapons of the guerrilla forces in various regions. Yu Hanmou, Li Hanhun, Cai Tingkai, and the central government's special envoys Chen Cheng, Luo Zhuoying, Wu Qiwai, etc., all sent representatives to participate, or personally attended to provide guidance. The guerrilla commanders of various regions who had previously gone to Shantou to go to Wengyuan included Ye Ting, Deng Yanhua, Zhang Wodong, Liu Zhilu, and Weng Zhaoyuan. Those who set out from various places included Li Fulin, Wu Guanqi, Zhang Huichang, Li Wuzi, Feng Zhuoxun, Zhang Junsong, Tan Qixiu, Hu Wencan, Ma Yi, etc., totaling more than 100 people, all leaders of the armed forces of the Guangdong people. It is reported that after the abolition of the Guangdong Provincial Self-Defense Team Command Committee, the command committees of various districts and counties were dissolved and renamed guerrilla command headquarters. The county government also set up command posts. Each county pre-selected several mountainous areas as guerrilla bases, and all the local team armed forces were reorganized into guerrilla forces, with uniform organization and supplies. The purpose is to cooperate with the regular army in combat. After this Wengyuan conference, the armed forces of the people of Guangdong are expected to be fundamentally renewed, and close ties will be established between the military and political grassroots.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Bomb, Imperial Airways Mail Plane Encounters Danger, Captain Returns to Hong Kong, Truth Revealed</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence, A few months ago, the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane "Guilin" flew from Hong Kong to Hankou and was tragically attacked by Japanese planes over Zhongshan County at the mouth of the Pearl River, resulting in the destruction of the plane and the loss of life, creating an unprecedented tragedy. The pain is still in our minds. Unexpectedly, the Japanese army, which recently invaded southern China, fired on the Imperial Airways plane "Gielandia" flying from Hong Kong. Fortunately, no tragedy occurred. It was found that the Imperial Airways plane "Gielandia" was attacked by Japanese artillery on the morning of the 27th of last month, over the sea of Wanshan Islands. Afterwards, because the Hong Kong authorities kept the matter secret, no one knew the details. Yesterday (2nd) afternoon, Wilson, the captain of the "Gielandia" plane who had encountered danger at that time, returned to Hong Kong in another plane, the "Danae". The detailed process was finally made public. It is reported that at 7 a.m. on the 21st of last month, the Imperial Airways Hong Kong-Manila mail plane "Gielandia", piloted by Captain Wilson, took off from Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon. When the plane flew to the sky over Wanshan Islands, about 250 miles from Hong Kong, Wilson looked down from the plane and saw two fishing boats burning on the sea. The flames spread everywhere, and the fierce flames soared into the sky. They burned and drifted, and the situation was extremely tragic. A Japanese warship was slowly advancing behind the fishing boats, seemingly still monitoring the burning. Wilson thought that this kind of incident was commonplace in the South China Sea, so he did not pay attention to it. Unexpectedly, the plane advanced only a few miles. In the south of Wanshan Islands, another Japanese transport ship was discovered. Wilson was staring down, when suddenly a ball of smoke and fire came out from the side of the ship. It was then that he knew that the ship had fired at the plane. Without changing his expression, he slightly moved the plane upwards, raising it from a height of one thousand feet to fifteen hundred feet. However, the Japanese warship continued to fire. The first shell passed over the top of the plane and fell into the sea. The second and third shells followed. Fortunately, none of them hit. As for the fourth shell, its range was just the height of the plane, and it exploded with a bang. Fortunately, the distance from the fuselage was relatively far, and it was not damaged. At that point, Wilson fully accelerated and flew forward quickly. After escaping the danger, he immediately sent a telegram to inform the "Danae", which had taken off half an hour later than the "Gielandia", instructing it to quickly change its course and never pass through Wanshan Islands again. After receiving the telegram, the "Danae" immediately bypassed Wanshan Islands 40 miles south to avoid being attacked again. After this incident occurred, the Hong Kong authorities did not make any public statements, so it is not known whether a protest has been lodged with the Japanese. However, it is heard that Imperial Airways may temporarily change its route in the future to avoid incidents.</p>
<h3>The Jiangsu Construction Department Plans to Set Up a Shipping Management Office and Formulate Organizational Rules</h3>
<p>Huaiyin Correspondence, The Jiangsu Construction Department has learned that after various shipping companies in the province have obtained routes from the department, they operate freely. The departure times are often not connected, which is inconvenient for merchants and travelers. The transportation of passengers and goods has never been regulated, and supply and demand are difficult to balance. It is urgent to reorganize it in order to provide relief and meet practical needs. It has specially prepared the draft of the organizational regulations and budget for the establishment of the Jiangsu Provincial Shipping Management Office, which has been submitted to the provincial government meeting for amendment and approval. Director Xu of the department has also been appointed as the director of the office. The Huaiyin Hebei Bank of Communications warehouse has been selected as the office address, and it will be formally established soon. It is learned that the organization of the office is divided into three sections: general affairs, transportation, and inspection, to carry out the affairs. Temporary offices have been set up in Hexing Town in Shanghai and Taixian County. Additional offices will be set up in other places as necessary.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Bomb Dinghai, Several Shops are Destroyed, "Li Bao" Wheel is Searched En Route</h3>
<p>Ningbo Special Dispatch, Three warships of the Japanese Fourth Fleet arrived at the waters of Datoutou in Dinghai on the morning of the 5th, one after another. They lowered a small motorboat to chase sailing boats and shot at them with rifles. The army and police on the shore immediately retaliated with machine guns. The motorboat scurried back to the ship. The Japanese warships then bombarded the shore with fierce artillery fire, totaling more than ten rounds, and then stopped. At 9 p.m., they fired more than 20 rounds again without being retaliated against. At about 8 a.m. on the morning of the 6th, they fired two shots at the shore. The Tongshoutai Sauce Garden, Yangchun Restaurant, and Dongyue Temple in front of Datoutou were destroyed by artillery fire. It is not known whether there were any casualties among the people. The Portuguese merchant ship "Li Bao" set sail to Ningbo at 6 a.m. on the 6th. It was obstructed by Japanese warships, and was released only after a motorboat was sent to board the ship for inspection.</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Breach is Temporarily Difficult to Block, Dredge the Subei Waterway to the Sea</h3>
<p>The Central Provincial Government Allocates Funds to Start Work First, The First Phase of the Project Requires 400,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Taixian Special Dispatch, Since the breach of the Yellow River in Yu, flowing down to the south, the Lixia River area, such as Xinghua, Dongtai, Yancheng, Funing, Jiangyan, Taixian, Gaoyou, Baoying, Huai'an and other counties, have all suffered greatly. The gentry and officials of the above-mentioned counties, because it is winter, and the accumulated water in the lower reaches has not yet receded. If no measures are taken to cut off the source of the Yellow River and dredge the waterway east of the Fan Gong Dike into the sea, then when the peach flood arrives, the entire northern Jiangsu will inevitably be submerged by half. They jointly telegraphed the National Government and relevant ministries and councils. The Jiangsu Provincial Government has repeatedly appealed. The Jiangsu Provincial Government also knows that if the upstream flow is not cut off and the river into the sea is not dredged, the catastrophe in northern Jiangsu will be unavoidable. It has repeatedly reported the situation to the central government and requested that measures be taken to block the breaches at the Zhaokou in Zhongmou, Henan and the Huayuankou in Zheng County to cut off the source. On one hand, it organized the Lixia River Waterway Dredging Project Commission in Dongtai, and appointed Han Guojun as the chairman. It also convened the first standing committee meeting in Dongtai to discuss the dredging project plan.</p>
<p>The Construction Procedure is Divided into Three Phases</p>
<p>The construction procedures have also been agreed upon. It has been found that there are five major ports east of the Fan Dike. In recent years, the Chuan Dong Port, also known as the Xingchuan Port, has been opened, totaling six ports. The Suyang River has the most unobstructed drainage, followed by the Xinyang Port and the Doulong Port. The Wangjia Port, the Zhu Port, and the Chuan Dong Port are the next. All six ports are currently flowing water. It is difficult to cut off the dam and make large diversions. The only way is to dredge the tributaries in order to discharge more cubic meters of water, which can reduce the flood by one cubic meter. As for the construction procedures, they are divided into three phases, depending on the amount of funds available, in order of priority. The first phase is the most urgent. The Eight Hundred Wen Yin River and its upstream second Maoyou River flow out of Wangjia Port. The fourth Maoyou River flows out of Shiwan Port, so it is to divert the water from Doulong Port and return it to the sea in different ways. Doulong is located in the middle of the five major ports, and the main stream, which receives many tributaries on the left, is mostly curved, making it difficult to collect. It is advisable to seek to reduce its flow or cut off its bends to make it faster and straighter. In addition, the Xichao River diverts the water from the Wuyou Chuan Chang River and merges with the Sheyang River estuary to return to the sea. Chuan Chang is the key to the waterway to the sea, and it is advisable to open more routes to prevent it from being blocked. This is the first phase of the work that must be done. The other two phases of work are detailed in the plan. The total cost of the project is estimated to be over one million yuan, and the first phase also requires more than 400,000 yuan. In terms of its effectiveness, if the Yellow River does not come and the post dam is blocked, the accumulated water in the lower reaches can gradually be reduced, and the people's fields can be dried up, so as not to miss the spring plowing.</p>
<p>The Central Government Allocates Funds to Subsidize Dredging</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government believes that the two breaches of the Yellow River at Huayuankou and Zhaokou have already been ordered by the Central Government to be closed due to special circumstances. In the future, the main flow of the Yellow River will change its course from here, seizing the Huai and entering Jiangsu. The section of the Huai River downstream into the sea has collapsed a lot, and the quicksand has also silted up the riverbed. The Yellow River swirls and wraps around the Lixia River area, failing to flow smoothly into the sea, resulting in floods in Gaoyou, Baoying, Huai'an, and Yangzhou counties, and causing serious disasters. Chairman Han believes that since the root cause cannot be cured, the symptoms must be treated first. He prepares to dredge the Lixia River waterway into the sea. The Provincial Government previously telegraphed the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the National Government, requesting a subsidy of 100,000 yuan for the project to start work. Yesterday, the Minister Weng Wenhao telegram (23rd) was received, stating that the case of blocking the breach of the Yellow River was previously submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan for discussion and a public resolution, and that the provincial government should also discuss the case together. It was resolved that the waterway dredging project should be investigated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and a subsidy should be given at its discretion. Because the dredging project is of vital importance, and according to the previous order, the subsidy of 100,000 yuan should be allocated to assist. In addition to responding, a telegram will be sent requesting that someone be sent with the seal to the Ministry to discuss the receipt.</p>
<p>Wu Zhihui and Others Telegraphed Their Opinions</p>
<p>Wu Zhihui, Chen Guofu, Niu Yongjian, etc. telegraphed Chairman Han, and also told Han Zhilao, saying that the Yellow River blockage project may be difficult to realize, and it is planned to ask the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee to handle it again. However, this year's Yellow River flood may converge in northern Jiangsu, and it is hoped that the dredging project to the sea will be rushed to avoid the permanent sinking disaster in Huai'an and Yangzhou counties. It is also said that Shen Baixian is now preparing to propose a northern Jiangsu water control plan, and will request that it be adopted. Yu Jingtang, a member of the Central Executive Committee and former director of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, once sent a telegram to Han Zhilao, which read, "I have received all the telegrams. I have discussed the matter of water discharge with Guofu, Chuqiang, and Yushou. We all feel that it is difficult to achieve success in treating the root cause due to environmental conditions for a while. We are discussing other methods and will jointly respond in a telegram within days. Recently, I have repeatedly consulted with Junti Baixian. We all believe that the current northern Jiangsu flood should be quickly blocked and the two new dams should be sealed to cut off the flow. Build three river grass dams and open the Changzhuang active dam to force the flow into the sea. Dredge the blocked parts of the lower river leading to the sea to facilitate drainage. However, increasing the size of the port leading to the sea is a huge project with little effect. For the sake of next year's major flood, it seems more feasible and urgent to strengthen the western embankment of the Grand Canal from Baoying to Shaobo, so as to increase the storage of floodwater in Hongze Lake. The Hongze Lake embankment itself, in addition to adding stone work, does not need to be strengthened for the time being. This is Junti Baixian's opinion, and I am sending it to you in advance for reference."</p>
<h3>Yixing Under the Rule of the National Army: Improving Governance and Enhancing Self-Defense (Continued)</h3>
<p>Abolishing Unfair Taxes and Stabilizing Finance: Education and Judiciary Have Returned to the Old Norms</p>
<p>Sorting out public funds and public assets: The public funds and assets of the local area after the war were chaotic, either embezzled by unscrupulous individuals for personal gain, or misappropriated by local authorities. A method of sorting them out has been drafted and distributed to various districts for active rectification. In the future, the Finance Committee will be responsible for handling it.  Balancing prices: All kinds of essential goods are strictly prohibited from being inflated in price, reducing the burden on the military and civilians, and eliminating the phenomenon of hoarding for profit. At the same time, except for the consumption goods of cigarettes, which are subject to a small inspection fee in accordance with provincial orders, all other taxes on various essential goods are exempted. Stabilizing finance: War zones are full of traitors, deliberately spreading rumors in an attempt to undermine China's legal tender policy. This has been thoroughly destroyed, enhancing the credibility of legal tender.  Prohibiting the sale of Japanese goods: Certain parties are transporting large quantities of Japanese goods to the interior, carrying out economic aggression. Merchants are now strictly prohibited from selling them, and business registration is being conducted for control purposes. If found, they will be severely punished.  Sorting out land tax registers: The land tax registers of the entire county have been assigned to specialists for sorting and moving to safe locations to ensure the property rights of the people.  Abolishing unfair levies and miscellaneous taxes: The county has repeatedly experienced turmoil, and there is a lack of local leadership, leading to a loss of system and chaotic social order. Local ruffians and informal guerrilla units have taken the opportunity to set up checkpoints and levy taxes, making life difficult for the people. Since County Magistrate Shao took office, all of these have been abolished to relieve the people's suffering.</p>
<p>People's Self-Defense</p>
<p>(C) Self-Defense:  Organizing Standing Teams: In the past, the county government's direct armed force was the special task force of the People's Self-Defense Force. Now, in accordance with provincial orders, it has been reorganized into a standing squadron. Three squadrons have been established, and the fourth squadron is being expanded. Discipline is clearly defined, and it has gained the trust of the people.  Organizing National Self-Defense Corps: The entire county is organized into eight district brigades, and each district brigade is divided into eight teams: (1) Work Team, (2) Iron Shoulder Team, (3) Relief Team, (4) Intelligence Team, (5) Disciplinary Team, (6) Messenger Team, (7) Propaganda Team, (8) Demolition Team. Each township mobilizes more than 300 people on a regular basis.  Conducting Firearm Registration: The purpose of firearm registration is to count and protect the people's armed forces, allocate ammunition, and defend the homeland. The public is enthusiastically registering.  Recruiting Soldiers: This time, the county government was ordered to recruit soldiers, and it has been transferred as scheduled. It is rare for Yixing people to go out as soldiers, but this time, young men throughout the county have enthusiastically enlisted.  Destroying Highways: All highways within the county have been completely destroyed. Young men enthusiastically participated in the work. During the most tense period, more than 10,000 young men were mobilized at the same time.  Establishing Sentry Communication Network and Receiving Stations: Sentries are densely deployed in important towns within the county, and receiving stations are set up to facilitate the transmission of information. A total of 88 stations of all levels, including general and branch stations, and 7 receiving stations have been set up throughout the county. As for communication matters with other counties, a communication network has been organized. There are close ties with Jiangyin, Wuxi, Wujin, Aoyang, Gaochun, and Jintan counties.  Constructing Defensive Works: Following the orders of the garrison commander, the people were mobilized to construct various strong defensive works.  Efforts to Eliminate Traitors: The leading traitors, Zhou Shichang, Luo Zhiying, Li Ya'er, Xiang Penggui, Li Songbai, Hong Lao Hong, etc., have all been successively captured by the county government and sentenced to capital punishment, greatly pleasing the people. The self-defense forces in various districts and the standing squadrons do not distinguish between day and night, assisting the garrison in defense, and launching guerrilla attacks at any time, repeatedly making contributions. (D) Education: Yixing's education was originally developed, but unfortunately, after two invasions by the Japanese army, all construction within the territory was destroyed, and education was also greatly impacted. Now, after active rectification, it is gradually returning to the old norm. Currently, there are: One secondary school with four branches, totaling eight grades; Seventeen complete elementary schools with thirty-six grades; One hundred and seventy-nine primary schools with two hundred and fifty-five grades. (E) Judiciary: In order to protect human rights and maintain judicial dignity, the establishment of a Judicial Section was approved by the Provincial Government and the Supreme Court, effective from November 21, 27th year. Judicial police officers have been appointed separately, and various judicial papers have been printed in accordance with regulations. Civil and criminal lawsuits are handled in accordance with the proper procedures, which is no different from before the war. In addition, the county government also publishes the Yixing Daily to promote the significance of resistance against Japan, in order to achieve the task of spiritual mobilization. (The End)</p>
<h3>Bandit Suppression Period in Linhai</h3>
<p>Linhai Correspondence: The people of this county are strong and brave, and there have always been many bandit troubles. During this extraordinary period, the banditry is especially rampant. Since County Magistrate Cao took office, he has personally gone down to the villages for inspections. He has drafted a plan for bandit suppression and carried out zonal extermination. In recent days, thanks to the effective command of the bandit suppression officers in various districts and the valiant efforts of the soldiers, the number of bandits killed and captured and the refugees rescued is countless. However, the original plan was to suppress bandits for one month, from January 16th to February 15th. In order to completely eradicate them, County Magistrate Cao has reportedly requested an extension of two months to ensure complete eradication.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Yiling, Repelled by Chinese Troops</h3>
<p>Taixian Correspondence: At around 10:00 AM on the 2nd, more than 200 Japanese troops from the Xiannv Temple, divided into three routes, invaded Yiling Town from Zhuanqiao. The artillery fire was fierce. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, the Chinese troops temporarily moved to new lines. The Japanese troops then occupied Yiling Town, setting fires and massacring the people. Before long, the Chinese troops counterattacked with extraordinary courage. At around 5:00 PM, the Japanese troops could not withstand and were routed. The Japanese side suffered many casualties in this battle.</p>

<h3>Customs Revenue of Shanghai, Tianjin, Qinhuangdao, and Jiaodong: 150 Million Intercepted; Unauthorized Reduction of Tax Rates Benefits Japan; Funds for Customs-Secured Debt are Unfunded</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, North China and Shanghai, unfortunately, have successively fallen into war zones. After the various customs houses within the war zones were seized by the Japanese, tax revenues were forcibly deposited in the Japanese-owned Yokohama Specie Bank, and import taxes on Japanese goods were reduced without authorization to facilitate dumping. The export tax rates on goods needed by Japan were also reduced to facilitate exports to Japan. Last year, the total tax revenue of the various customs houses was 158,960,000 yuan. Except for 1,180,000 yuan remitted by the Jianghai Customs, the rest has not been remitted to the government, resulting in unfunded funds for customs duties and surplus-secured domestic and foreign prices.

<h3>Japan Illegally Inspects and Detains Foreign Vessels; Various Consulates Have Protested</h3>
<p>Japanese Navy Claims Inspections are Appropriate; Prevent Chinese Vessels from Hanging Foreign Flags for Protection</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports: Foreign vessels sailing along China's coast and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River are frequently subjected to illegal inspections and detentions by Japanese warships, causing significant losses to foreign vessels. The consuls of the countries to which the detained foreign vessels belong have protested to the Japanese authorities. However, according to the response from the Japanese naval authorities, regarding the issue of inspecting vessels flying the flags of third countries, such inspections are not an unusual or serious matter. It does not seem excessive for the Japanese side to inspect vessels flying foreign flags. They firmly believe that after the war, all Chinese merchant vessels are using foreign flags for protection. For example, the Ada, a vessel flying the Hungarian flag that was recently detained by the Japanese navy in Xiamen, is worthy of research as to whether it belongs to Hungary.</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports:</p>
<p>The Hungarian wooden merchant vessel Ada, weighing 137 tons, was still detained by the Japanese navy at a certain pier in Xiamen Port last night (6th). According to a Japanese navy spokesman last night, the Ada vessel is staying there pending the completion of a thorough investigation of the procedures of its owner. According to inquiries from shipping circles in this port:</p>
<p>The captain of the Ada vessel is Norwegian, Steen, and there are 30 to 40 Chinese crew members. The vessel's agency in this port replied to inquiries yesterday afternoon, denying that the vessel was carrying passengers and expressly stating that it only had a special permit to transport goods. The vessel was originally named Tongli (transliteration) and was built in Wenzhou in 1935. On October 27th of last year, it was purchased by a Hungarian named Komor. After installing a motor, it was managed by the</p>
<p>new owner.</p>
<p>The reporter asked the spokesman: If the Ada vessel changed ownership on this day and is operated by people from a third country, does it comply with the Japanese navy's regulations? The spokesman replied that the Japanese navy will decide its attitude towards this incident based on the authenticity of the change of ownership and other factors. It has been rumored that Chinese-owned sailboats and other vessels are flying the flags of third countries, so the Japanese navy reserves the right to investigate the</p>
<p>identity of these vessels.</p>
<p>If it is determined that the owner is completely foreign, it will be released immediately. The spokesman replied again that the Japanese authorities have not yet demanded compensation for time and other losses for detaining any foreign vessels and investigating their owners. The current detention of the Ada and other vessels has no special meaning and does not indicate a "change of policy," but is merely a "fixed policy" consistently clarified in the declaration issued by the Japanese navy to Chinese vessels a few months ago.</p>
<h3>New Commander of British Troops in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 7th: The War Office has announced that it has appointed Colonel Simmons, currently stationed in Palestine, as the commander of the British troops in Shanghai, effective June 5th.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of US Relief Wheat to Arrive in Shanghai Soon; Quantity Larger, Approximately 3,000 Tons</h3>
<p>A large batch of US relief wheat for China, previously 2,600 tons, was transported to Shanghai. According to shipping industry news, its second batch of relief wheat has also been shipped from the United States to Shanghai on a Wei Li Han Company cargo ship. The quantity is larger than the last time, approximately 3,000 tons, and will arrive in Shanghai within a few days.</p>
<h3>Complex Issues Require Time to Resolve; Hongkou Still Difficult to Open</h3>
<p>Rumors of the Opening of Broadway Road; Investigation Proves it is Untrue</p>
<p>Negotiations between the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Japanese side on the issue of opening Hongkou have lasted for more than a year without results. Yesterday, rumors suddenly spread that the area around East Broadway Road in Hongkou will be officially opened during the Lunar New Year, allowing residents to freely move in and reside there, etc. After reporters inquired with the Shanghai Municipal Council, they learned that this rumor is not true. The official opening of Hongkou is, in fact, still premature. Although the negotiations between the two sides are still progressing smoothly, there is no actual decision. The Shanghai Municipal Council believes that this matter is complex and there are many difficulties, and it will take time to resolve it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Come to Shanghai to Seek a Living, Holding High Hopes</h3>
<p>Few Find Employment; Residents' Association Responds</p>
<p>The English-language Greater Shanghai Evening Post reports: According to Japanese sources, Japanese people who came to Shanghai from Japan with only travel expenses to seek employment are now finding it difficult to fulfill their wishes. Only about three-tenths of them are employed. When their travel funds run out, these job seekers have no choice but to apply to the employment agency of the Japanese Residents' Association. Therefore, the department has been unusually busy recently. According to figures released by the department, 296 men and 68 women applied to the department in December last year. Only 102 men and 8 women were employed. In January, there were 228 men and 44 women, and only 85 men and 18 women were employed. Among the various occupations handled by the department, drivers, interpreters, shop assistants, secretaries, nurses, telephone operators, and cooks are the most numerous.</p>
<h3>Redemption of Unified Class A Public Bonds; Lottery Drawing the Day After Tomorrow; Payment of Principal and Interest of the Revival Bond at the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee has announced that the seventh redemption lottery for the Class A bond tickets of the Unified Public Bonds of the Republic of China in the twenty-fifth year will be held the day after tomorrow (10th) at 10:00 AM at the Bankers Association on Hong Kong Road. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and other organizations have been notified to send personnel to supervise. The principal and interest due for the sixth redemption of the Revival Public Bonds of the Republic of China in the twenty-fifth year will be paid by the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications on February 28th, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Finance (i.e., full payment in Chongqing).</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables Requesting Permission for Raw Lacquer to be Transported to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Shanghai Commerce is Concentrated in the Concessions; Raw Lacquer is Not an Item that Benefits Japan</p>
<p>After the customs of Zhejiang, Fujian, and other provinces were ordered to prohibit the transport of tung oil, timber, cotton, raw lacquer, etc., to Shanghai, the chambers of commerce and industry associations in various places cabled requesting a lifting of the ban. The raw lacquer and other industries in Shanghai previously sent personnel to the interior to purchase native goods and transport them to Shanghai. Recently, due to the customs' prohibition order, they could not be released. Now, the Raw Lacquer Industry Association has specially reported to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce believes that Shanghai commerce is concentrated in the concession areas. Since the withdrawal of the National Army to the west, the commercial activities in Nanshi and Zhabei that could be relocated have been moved to the safety zones of the two concessions. Raw lacquer is necessary for the coating of residents' daily utensils and is not an item that benefits Japan. Therefore, it has cabled the Ministry of Economic Affairs, consulting with the Ministry of Finance to order the customs to inspect and release the goods, in order to maintain the circulation of commodities.</p>
<h3>Japanese Garrison at the Intersection of Shangchuan Road and Caojia Road Annihilated</h3>
<p>Chinese Troops Attack at Night, Cutting Military Telephone Lines; Only Two or Three Japanese Troops Escape</p>
<p>A fierce battle occurred between Chinese and Japanese troops at the intersection of Caojia Road and the town of Jinjia Bridge on the Shangchuan Railway line in Pudong at around 9:00 PM the night before last. The battle at Caojia Road was fierce, with booming artillery fire lasting for two hours. Of the Japanese soldiers guarding the town, only two or three escaped alive. Six or seven were killed on the spot,</p>
<p>and the rest were captured, almost all annihilated. Four puppet "police" also died from bullets. This was the first most glorious victory for the Chinese troops since the August 13th Memorial Day and National Day Memorial last year. At 9:00 PM that night, more than 100 Chinese troops, using light and agile night marches, suddenly appeared around Caojia Road Town. First, they cut the Japanese military telephone lines and then advanced to Cao Town from the east and west, surrounding the area near the station.</p>
<p>Japanese stronghold. In the eyes of the Japanese army, the town was more important, so more than 20 soldiers were regularly stationed there day and night. At that time, several sentries were lying in ambush inside the sandbag defenses, and the rest were sleeping. In the darkness, the Chinese troops fired concentrated machine gun fire, and the Japanese sentries quickly returned fire. The remaining Japanese soldiers woke up in fright and scrambled to fight back, but the Chinese troops were heavily surrounded on all sides. The Japanese army dragged out small steel cannons, regarding them as a relied-upon weapon, and frequently opened fire to show force. For a time,</p>
<p>the sound of artillery boomed, alarming those far and near. The eight puppet "police" (the puppet "police" there had already been issued guns) were also forced to fight. After about two hours of fighting, seven or eight Japanese soldiers and four puppet "police" were killed. Because the telephone lines were cut, there were no reinforcements for the Japanese army. Fighting until their voices were hoarse and exhausted, the Chinese troops bravely charged into the Japanese stronghold. Fourteen wounded Japanese soldiers were captured on the spot. Only two or three uninjured soldiers took off their uniforms and escaped in the confusion. After the Chinese troops obtained a</p>
<p>major victory, they destroyed the Japanese fortifications and triumphantly withdrew with the prisoners. At the same time, at around 9:00 PM in the Jinjia Bridge area, dozens of guerrillas attacked the town. There were only eight Japanese soldiers stationed in Jin Town. One was killed on the spot, and the rest fled back to Yanpu Bian Gao Miao Town. The Chinese troops did not pursue and retreated immediately. After dawn yesterday morning, the Japanese army's Kawashima Zhihiro headquarters in Chuansha was greatly alarmed, but because the situation in Chuancheng was tense and there were fewer than 100 Japanese soldiers stationed there, it was impossible to dispatch troops. As a result,</p>
<p>there were no troops stationed in Cao Town. They urgently requested 20 soldiers from the 70-man Ogawa unit of the Japanese guard force at the Nanmatou in the South Huangpu, who reluctantly took two small steel cannons and several machine guns and boarded a small boat. At 11:00 AM, they were transported to the Gaomiao ferry to disembark and then took the Shangchuan train to Caojia Road to take over the defense. Therefore, the situation on Shangchuan Road was tense yesterday. In the past, each bus had at least 200 to 300 passengers, with similar numbers going up and down. But yesterday, each bus had only 20 to 30 people, and the total business for the day was less than one-tenth of the usual.</p>
<h3>Flour Mills and Grain Merchants Purchase 100,000 Tons of Foreign Wheat; Transported to Shanghai in Batches; Third Batch Changed Ports Yesterday; Expected to be Fully Transported Before the End of May</h3>
<p>Shanghai is the center of the national flour industry and is no less than an area where wheat from all over the country gathers. After the war, the Chinese government banned the transport of wheat to Shanghai, and wheat in the war zone was under Japanese control, making transport to Shanghai difficult. Flour mills in the concessions had no choice but to order from foreign countries due to the shortage of raw materials, totaling approximately 100,000 tons, which were transported to Shanghai in batches. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Wheat Shortage: Flour mills are the main customers of wheat. Therefore, in addition to wheat purchased through introductions from trading organizations, Shanghai factories also directly purchase wheat by setting up wheat purchasing offices in various wheat-producing areas. After the war, the Chinese government banned the export of wheat and re-export to occupied areas. As a result, wheat from Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Fujian, and other provinces could not be transported to Shanghai, and it was difficult for manufacturers to purchase wheat in the war zone around North China and Shanghai. As a result, all flour mills within the concessions were in a panic due to a shortage of raw materials, and all flour</p>
<p>production could not be fully started.</p>
<p>Ordering Foreign Wheat: Shanghai Fuxin, Fuxin, and other flour mills, as well as grain merchants dealing in wheat, had no choice but to order foreign wheat from foreign countries, totaling approximately 100,000 tons, entrusted to Daufu Foreign Firm and others to handle, and transported to Shanghai in batches by American ships. The first batch of 8,353 tons, loaded on the Rugely wheel, arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month. The second batch of 7,750 tons, loaded on the Harmatris, arrived in Shanghai on February 5. The third batch of 8,383 tons, loaded on the Riler wheel, arrived in Shanghai yesterday, berthing at responsibility Pu River No. 14 and 15 floating cylinder,</p>
<p>shipped in batches. A total of 24,486 tons of foreign wheat in the first, second, and third batches have arrived in Shanghai. The fourth batch of 8,893 tons, loaded on the JantZe, is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at the end of February. It is reported that a total of 100,000 tons of foreign wheat will be transported to Shanghai in 10 to 12 batches, and will be fully arrived by the end of May. Most of these foreign wheat is used to supply flour mills such as Fuxin and Fuxin in the concessions for flour production, which is the first sign of manufacturers ordering foreign wheat after the war.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council Sends Condolences to Mr. Little</h3>
<p>Mr. E.S. Little served as a director of the Shanghai Municipal Council many years ago. Unfortunately, he passed away in New Zealand three days ago. The colleagues of the bureau were deeply saddened upon learning of this. Yesterday, the chairman of the bureau, Fanklin, sent a letter to his son to express condolences and show mourning.</p>
<h3>Soybean and Rice Industry Association Makes Every Effort to Stabilize Rice Prices; Japanese Mass Purchases Reduce Stockpiles Day by Day; Authorities of Both Concessions Attach Great Importance</h3>
<p>National rice in the war zone is subject to mass purchases by North China merchants colluding with the Japanese side, and transported to Shanghai for loading on Japanese ships for private export. As a result, stockpiles in the war zone production areas are decreasing day by day, and rice prices are rising. Fortunately, there are sufficient stocks of rice in Shanghai, and there is no immediate fear of shortages. However, if this continues for a long time, it will be affected. Yesterday, it was learned from the rice market that the price of rice in Shanghai has been rising due to the scarcity of arrivals and the approaching Lunar New Year. The price of top-grade white rice has risen to twelve yuan and eight jiao. The Soybean and Rice Industry Association has ordered the market management committee to make every effort to stabilize rice prices and find ways to dredge the source. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession and the French Concession Board of Directors attach great importance to the price of rice in Shanghai, as it concerns people's livelihood, and have sent personnel to investigate rice stocks within the boundary to avoid the same unfortunate event as at the end of the previous year.</p>

<h3>Various Transportation and Sales Offices in Wenzhou Cable Requesting Exemption from the Prohibition of Exporting Six Kinds of Native Goods; Adjustment Office Orders Transportation and Sales Offices to Collect as Usual to Maintain the Market</h3>
<p>After the Ouhai Customs in various counties under the jurisdiction of Wenzhou received instructions from the Ministry of Finance prohibiting the export of goods, the various transportation and sales offices requested the authorities to consider accommodating and handling the matter, as it concerned the future of their business. After discussing relief measures, the various transportation and sales offices decided to cable the Ministry of Finance, requesting that native paper, timber, planks, fresh eggs, charcoal, and domestically sold tea leaves produced in various places under the jurisdiction of Wenzhou be exempted from the prohibition of transportation. It has been requested that the wartime property adjustment office forward it to the Ministry of Finance for verification. Now, the adjustment office has ordered the various transportation and sales offices to continue collecting various goods as usual to maintain the market.</p>
<h3>Japanese Attempt to Seize: Cheng Kee Shipping Six Vessels Anchored in Port Damaged by Storms; Rumors of Sale in Shanghai Not Confirmed</h3>
<p>The main office of Cheng Kee Shipping Company is located in Yantai, with branches and offices in various coastal locations. It has a total of 24 ships, including Gan Li, Kun Li, etc. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the coast has been blockaded by Japanese warships. All of the company's ships have been forced to cease operations. With the exception of Hong Li, which was seized in Qingdao for blockade purposes, six ships including Feng Li, Sheng Li, and Mao Li are anchored in Hong Kong. Rumors circulated that the six vessels anchored in Hong Kong had been sold to the Japanese. Crew members had reportedly agreed to resign and telegraphed for appeals. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency inquired with maritime circles yesterday and learned that Cheng Kee Company has a branch office in Shanghai, located on Rue du Sacré-Cœur in the French Concession. The manager, Wang Bofen, is a member of the Shipping Industry Association. He had not received any reports from the head office regarding the sale of the six vessels anchored in Hong Kong to the Japanese side. However, according to speculation, it is definitely not true. The Japanese have repeatedly attempted to seize the aforementioned six vessels anchored in Hong Kong without success. Some of the vessels were damaged during a typhoon while anchored in Hong Kong and are currently undergoing repairs. The tonnage of the six vessels ranges from 1,800 to 3,200 tons each.</p>
<h3>Trade Association Forms Fundraising Committee: Fundraising to Proceed; First Meeting Held Yesterday; Procedures to be Drafted</h3>
<p>The Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Trade Association Group held its first plenary committee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the New Pharmaceutical Industry Association on Rue Longmen. The constitution was adopted, and officers were elected. Representatives from the Association, including Xu Jiguang, attended to provide guidance. Details are as follows:</p>

The committee then discussed and adopted the constitution, elected central committee members, elected standing committee members and heads of various departments and general directors, organized a design committee, and regarding methods for promoting fundraising, following the instructions of Fang Jiaobo, the standing committee will draft detailed procedures for implementation. Also, the motion proposed by committee member Zheng Zenan was passed to transfer year-end surpluses from businesses to refugee relief efforts.</p>
<p>Elected Officers: The association elected the following important officers: Honorary Chairmen: Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Fang Jiaobo, Lin Kanghou; Chairmen: Jin Runxiang, Zhu Wenqi, Ma Shaoquan; Standing Committee Members: Xu Jiguang, Yu Zuoting, Lu Wenshao, Chen Ziyi, Ding Fangyuan, Xu Guanling, Wu Xingcha, Shen Weiting, Sun Qiuping, Zhang Lianfang, Zheng Zenan; Head of General Affairs Department: Cheng Kefan, Wang Yuanzhang, Ge Weian; Head of Auditing Department: Li Wenjie, Zhang Wenkui, Yu Tinghui; Head of Fundraising Department: Xu Wenzhao, Hong Wenjiang, Tu Kaizheng; Head of Design Department: Chen Panjun, Yu Langxi, Chen Wenming; Head of Propaganda Department: Zhou Bangjun, Xu Xiaochu, Yang Weiyin; General Directors: Sun Hongqi, Yuan Hongjun; Design Committee Members: Zhang Nianxuan, Gu Kemin, Xia Xianting, Xie Zhongle, Bao Guobiao, Pei Yunxiang, Xu Xiangsun, Ge Junchen, Zhu Zixiang, Wu Wuliang, Chen Yongnian, Wang Hanliang, Yan Esheng, Zhuang Honggao, Xu Zhengke, etc.</p>
<p>Refugee Products: Citizen Shen Linxi suggested yesterday to the Refugee Relief Association that they implement a practical plan to assist refugees outside of the shelters by accepting their products. The methods include: Accepting these products through established refugee product sales outlets, or having the Association commission enthusiastic relief-minded businesses as agents; Selling the products, retail or wholesale, with the Association acting as an agent, taking a reasonable handling fee, giving a portion to the commissioned sellers, and using the remainder for refugee shelter donations; The acceptance and sale of these products will be publicly announced in the newspapers once the preparatory procedures are completed.</p>
<p>Collecting Medicine for Relief: The Shanghai New Pharmaceutical Industry Association issued an appeal to its members, stating that since the war began, countless compatriots have been displaced and become refugees. In Shanghai alone, there are hundreds of thousands. They often suffer from hunger and cold, leading to illness, which can be seen everywhere. Many die because they have nowhere to get treatment or lack medicine. Although various charitable organizations are providing assistance to refugees with illnesses, and various sectors of society are providing relief to refugees in need, we know that the need for relief, especially medical care, is still pressing, both in the interior and in the city. Refugees are all descendants of the Chinese nation, all part of the nation's strength. How can we turn a blind eye to their suffering? Our relief efforts cannot be a one-time or isolated event. The new pharmaceutical industry in this city has a considerable presence. During the war, our members have fulfilled part of our duty to help refugees, but it is still not enough. For the sake of humanity and the future of our country, we, the new pharmaceutical industry, should more actively and broadly engage in relief efforts. At the same time, based on the principle advocated by our supreme leader of "those with money contribute money, those with strength contribute strength," we, the new pharmaceutical industry, should each do our best to serve the country and strive together for a bright future for the nation, which is also striving for the future of our own industry. Therefore, we have launched this "medicine collection for relief" campaign to harness the power of our new pharmaceutical industry to help refugees and fulfill our duty as citizens to the country. We, the members of the new pharmaceutical industry, are all patriots with a strong sense of national consciousness and a strong sense of humanity and justice. We believe that this "medicine collection for relief" will receive widespread support and promotion. We extend our hands warmly, looking forward to the enthusiastic participation of our fellow members of the new pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>Verifying Donations: The Refugee Relief Association sent a letter to the hotel, restaurant, and Western restaurant associations yesterday, stating that their efforts in handling refugee relief funds since the fifth [month, year unspecified] have been commendable and deeply appreciated. The Association has been in contact with municipal authorities in the concessions and will conduct its own audits to establish direct contact for administrative purposes and avoid procedural difficulties. Starting February 1st, the Association will dispatch Yan Yilin, Wu Jiaqi, Zhang Zhongyu, Yao Qiuyuan, Zhang Bofang, Yuan Hongjun, Zhang Xingfu, and Li Ziyang as auditors to various locations to verify donation amounts. They request that the respective associations send representatives to assist and inform their members to provide assistance and convenience as needed. Furthermore, the Restaurant Association has collected 50,596.23 yuan in refugee donations since collecting the 105th [iteration, year unspecified] donation, until the end of January. In order to encourage fundraising efforts by its members, the association has requested the Association to award the best performers after the fundraising campaign is concluded.</p>
<h3>Japanese Financial Difficulties: More "Yen" to be Issued; Continuing Issuance of 300 Million or 500 Million Yen; Fierce Debate Over Increasing Reserve Funds</h3>
<p>According to the "Continental News," the "Japan Chronicle" reports that a proposal to further amend the Bank of Japan Law will be submitted to the current session of the Diet. The new bill seeks to authorize the Bank of Japan to continue issuing banknotes worth 300 million or 500 million yen. In the last session of the Diet, the limit had already been increased from 1 billion yen to 1.7 billion yen. With a gold reserve of 80.1 million yen, the bank could issue banknotes up to 2.5 billion yen without paying special taxes. However, Japan established a foreign exchange program in July last year and withdrew 300 million yen from the gold reserve. Therefore, today the maximum amount of banknotes the bank can issue without paying taxes is 2.2 billion yen. By the end of last year, the issued banknotes had exceeded the limit by 600 million yen. Since the beginning of this year, the Bank of Japan has rapidly withdrawn the issued banknotes, but in view of the continued increase in military spending, it is widely believed that the amount of currency in circulation will gradually increase. Therefore, the financial authorities believe it is necessary to increase the limit for secured reserve funds. There are differing opinions regarding the amount of the increase. Some believe that since the reserve has been reduced by 300 million yen, the reserve and banknotes should be increased by an equal amount. Others insist on a substantial increase. The financial authorities oppose any drastic increase, as it would easily lead to inflation. The general opinion is to stipulate an increase of 500 million yen. In that case, the new limit would be 2.2 billion yen, or a total of 2.7 billion yen including the gold reserve.</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspaper Reports: Accuses Concession Authorities of Applying Pressure; Claims Japanese Citizens Encounter Difficulties Purchasing Gasoline; Chinese Drivers Also Subjected to Discrimination</h3>
<p>The "Continental News" reports that yesterday (February 6th), the Japanese-language "Shanghai Mainichi Shimbun" claimed that Chinese chauffeurs employed by Japanese citizens are subjected to unreasonable and slow pass inspections, and merchants refuse to sell gasoline to them, indicating "pressure" applied by authorities in the two concessions. It is often heard from Japanese citizens traveling south of Hongkou that they have encountered such "ill-treatment," and Japanese automobile businesses also complain of suffering such "ill-treatment." The newspaper cited a specific example, stating that a Chinese chauffeur employed by Japanese architect Okano, residing at 502 Rue de Dieppe, was stopped and interrogated by a patrolman in the French Concession, who then tore up the chauffeur's pass. The search ended thereafter. The newspaper concluded that if such a situation continues, Japanese residents in Hongkou may be forced not to drive their cars into the concession area.</p>
<h3>Quanguang Silk Factory: Labor Strike Escalates; Direct Labor-Management Negotiations Fail; Decision Made to Petition Ratepayers' Meeting</h3>
<p>Following the strike by all workers at the Quanguang Silk Factory on Route Kaufmann in Western Shanghai, direct negotiations between labor and management failed. The labor side claims that the management disregarded government labor protection laws, took advantage of the situation, continued to arrest worker Wan A’tu, and continued to dismiss workers Wang Zhengdong and Li Yuanfu, blatantly threatening a return to work. This provoked the anger of all workers, who decided to immediately petition the Shanghai Municipal Council Ratepayers' Meeting and other organizations, demanding justice and assistance.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Sends Letter to French Municipal Council Requesting Exemption from Increased Pawnshop Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce stated that according to a report from the Pawnshop Association, starting from January of this year, the Municipal Council's Tax Bureau suddenly increased the monthly business tax for pawnshops within the concession by 30% to 50% of the original amount. There was no prior notification, and the increase was arbitrary. This move is unfair. In recent years, the pawnshop business has been slow, and expenses have increased. They are already struggling to maintain operations. Once again, they are being burdened by heavy taxes. How can they bear it? They requested that measures be taken to negotiate an exemption. The Chamber of Commerce believes that the interest rates charged by pawnshops have always been limited and cannot be developed in an abnormal manner by taking advantage of the situation. This is a factual situation. After August 13th [likely referring to the Battle of Shanghai in 1937], the Municipal Council added a 10% surtax for defense purposes, which the industry has already struggled to bear. Now, another 30% to 50% increase is truly unsustainable. Citizens should pay taxes fairly and equitably based on their ability to pay. This principle should be considered by the Municipal Council. Therefore, based on the above situation, the Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the French Municipal Council, requesting that the newly proposed tax increase be exempted.</p>
<h3>Wanxian Red Swastika Society: Efforts in Relief Work; Relief Work Commenced in Guanchang and Shashi</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society received a report from Chongqing yesterday stating that the Society has organized the Southwest United Relief Team and departed for Wanxian, Yichang, Shashi, and other places to carry out relief work. The following is an excerpt from the Society's report: The Chongqing Society has organized a relief team, and in addition to establishing a children's home and clinics in Chongqing, it is also expanding various charitable services. The team, consisting of more than 30 members and staff, has arrived in Wanxian. The Wanxian branch has also formed a relief team of 20 members and staff, who have joined the team. A children's home has also been established in Wanxian, housing 100 orphans. A clinic has been established, with 12 Chinese and Western doctors, providing daily treatment to an average of over 100 people. A relief office has also been established, distributing dozens of piculs of rice daily. A lending office has also been established to help the poor. Currently, 120 rooms are being built on vacant land, named Wanfu Village, housing over 600 refugees. A porridge kitchen has also been established. Relief teams in Guanchang and Shashi are also working.</p>
<h3>Japanese Daizhi Bus: Intercepted in Nanxiang; Passengers Afraid to Ride</h3>
<p>A bus owned by the Japanese Daizhi Company, operating on the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, was suddenly intercepted on the afternoon of the day before yesterday at around 3:00 PM near Nanxiang Station, which belongs to Jiading County, by dozens of guerrillas from Deng Jinglie's troops who were lying in ambush by the side of the road. Dozens of shots were fired, shattering the bus windows. The Japanese soldiers escorting the bus, seeing the unfavorable situation, returned fire while ordering the driver to accelerate and escape. The passengers inside the bus all lay down on the seats at the time, avoiding injury. Since this incident, passengers are afraid to ride the bus for safety reasons, and business has sharply declined.</p>
<h3>Wuxing, Chaozhou, Shantou: Resumption of Remittances; Small Parcel Post to Sichuan and Guizhou: Temporarily Suspended to Remote Areas</h3>
<p>Wuxing Remittances: According to a message from the Zhejiang Postal Administration, Huzhou (Wuxing) Second Class Post Office resumed business on February 1st. In addition to accepting ordinary registered and express mail, it has also resumed remittance services. However, the payment of money orders is limited to 50 yuan per person per day. The Chang'an and Wangdian post offices also resumed remittance services on February 5th. The payment of money orders is limited to 50 yuan per person per day.</p>
<p>Chaozhou-Shantou Remittance Amount:</p>
<p>According to the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau, the situation in Chaozhou and Shantou in eastern Guangdong has improved. Since there are many people from Chaozhou and Shantou in Hong Kong and Macau, postal remittances have been restored between Chaozhou, Shantou, and Hong Kong and Macau to facilitate remittances. Express and registered mail services have also been restored at the same time. Remittances are limited to 500 yuan due to low income, and large-scale remittances are not possible.</p>
<p>Sichuan-Guizhou Small Parcels:</p>
<p>The Shanghai Postal Administration's Small Parcel Mailing and Dispatching Group issued a notice stating that individual and medicine parcels mailed to Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou Provinces can still be accepted, as previously notified. However, due to transportation difficulties, all individual and medicine parcels mailed to the above provinces, except those destined for Kunming and areas along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway in Yunnan Province, will be temporarily suspended from acceptance, effective immediately. This notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>British Yongzhen Vessel Detained: Japan Protests to Britain; Claims Interference with Qingdao Customs Duties</h3>
<p>The Yangzhen vessel, owned by the British Xia Laochen Foreign Firm, was loaded with goods in Shanghai and sailed to Funing Hexingzhen on January 24. It was suddenly searched on January 27 by the Haiyan vessel, a patrol boat from Qingdao Customs, in the Sheyang River, six [Chinese unit of distance] from Lianyungang off Hexingzhen. The shipowner refused to allow the search. Under the supervision of the Haiyan patrol boat, the vessel was forced to sail to the Qingdao sea area and anchor. It was then rescued by the British warship HMS Birmingham on January 29, following negotiations. It is now known that the Japanese side is dissatisfied with the British warship's interference, which prevented Qingdao Customs from performing its duties. On the afternoon of February 5, the Japanese Consul General lodged a verbal protest with the British Consul General, McDing.</p>

<h3>Two Assassination Cases Yesterday: Zhou Jitang and Gu Chongxi; Both Killed by Gunshots</h3>
<p>Zhou Was the Head of the Puppet "Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui Tin Foil Tax Bureau"; A Japanese Pass and Other Items Were Found on Gu</p>
<p>From 9:10 AM to 12:00 PM yesterday, two more assassinations occurred in the Shanghai Public Concession. One victim was Zhou Jitang, the head of the puppet "Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui Tin Foil Tax Bureau," and the other was a Cantonese named Gu Chongxi. The details of each case are as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Jitang:</p>
<p>Zhou Jitang, a native of Liyang, was 37 years old. Because he had lived in Suzhou for a long time, he always claimed to be from Wuxian. His wife, Sun, is 29 years old. They lived at No. 8 Qinyuan Village, Xinzha Road. It is said that he obtained the position of head of the puppet "Tin Foil Tax Bureau" purely due to the recommendation of Yan Jiachi, the puppet "Deputy Minister of Finance." In addition, he also served as an advisor to the puppet "Salt Affairs Inspection Office." Since taking this puppet position, Zhou has extensively collected money and extorted merchants, causing general business people to suffer greatly. Yesterday, at around 9:10 AM, Zhou Jitang received a phone call at home instructing him to go to the puppet "Bureau" quickly to handle important official matters. At the time, Zhou was wearing a fancy Western suit, with a gray squirrel and otter fur collar overcoat. He boarded his own car (license No. 3358), driven by his chauffeur, Li Jinsheng. When passing Gordon Road on Xinzha Road, three men suddenly jumped out from the side of the road. Two of them drew out handguns and approached Zhou from behind, shooting at him. One shot hit Zhou in the back of the neck, and he immediately bled profusely and fell onto the car. The chauffeur, Li Jinsheng, experienced a near-death experience and fled in terror. The assassins remained calm and walked forward. After confirming that Zhou was no longer breathing, they left a note reading "You are a traitor" on Zhou's car and then escaped. Shortly after, the patrol officers arrived after hearing the alert, but the assassins had already disappeared without a trace. They reported to the police station and summoned an ambulance to take Zhou to Baolong Hospital for treatment. However, because the injury was to a vital spot, he died soon after. The bullet remained near his nose. The hospital transferred the body to the coroner's office. Police detectives found many cards with his aforementioned puppet titles, a round-trip Wuxi permit issued by the Japanese, 160 yuan in cash, and a checkbook from a major bank, among his belongings. Furthermore, it is rumored that when Zhou's body arrived at the [missing character] hospital, an old woman accompanied him, but left without saying goodbye. Therefore, her name and identity are unknown. Everything is under investigation by the police.</p>
<p>Gu Chongxi:</p>
<p>Approximately from 11:40 AM yesterday, after the Zhou Jitang case occurred, another bloodshed case happened at a restaurant on Nanjing Road. It is said that at around 11:30 AM, seven Chinese men went straight to the second floor and found seats to eat. One of them was wearing a Western suit, speaking Cantonese, and was about 40 years old. The others were all speaking Min dialect and were all adults. They sat at table number 29. The Cantonese speaker instructed the waiter to prepare a 5-yuan meal. After speaking, he got up and went to the telephone by the stairs to make a phone call. It is said that the number he dialed was 93260 (East Asia Hotel). While he was on the phone, a man in a Zhongshan suit suddenly drew out a handgun and ran forward, shooting at him. The bullet hit the man in the Western suit in the head, and he fell to the ground. Seeing that his goal had been achieved, the shooter left a letter next to the injured man and beckoned to the others at the table. They all rushed downstairs. Upon reaching the ground floor, another shot was fired as a warning. The bullet pierced the display window glass and landed on a pile of glutinous rice cakes on the counter. They then calmly escaped. The Laozha patrol station received the news and immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to investigate and search, but found nothing. Only a letter with the words "Fosheng Electrical Company, Zhabei Road" written on the cover was found at the scene. They urgently summoned an ambulance to transport the injured man to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, he died en route due to serious injuries. The body was transferred to the coroner's office for autopsy. Police detectives found six business cards with the name "Cen Dongdao" written on them, with "Dongdao Society, Sangguang Town, Shiba District, Tokyo" and "No. 505 Desiwei Road, Shanghai Peace Manor, Telephone 45927" printed on the bottom left corner. In addition, there was a permit issued by the Japanese, with the name Gu Chongxi on it. His relationship and puppet position are currently under investigation.</p>
<h3>Flower Club "Sailing Vessel" Cracked Down on Aixi Road: Two Flower Club Criminals Sentenced; More Than Ten Gamblers Fined</h3>
<p>At No. 56, Lane 1337, Aixi Road, Gu A'er and others recently established a "sailing vessel" gambling den to lure gamblers to a flower club. Their gambling tactics were more sophisticated than any other recently arrested "sailing vessel" criminals. Therefore, they collected gambling money three times a day, morning, noon, and night, often amounting to 400 to 500 yuan. It was not until the day before yesterday that patrol officers from Chengdu Road became aware of this and sent a large team of Chinese and Western detectives, driving armed cars, to search and arrest. As soon as they entered the door, they were spotted by Ma Lesheng, hired by Gu as an assistant. He immediately threw the flower club papers into the stove to burn them. The detectives stopped him, but most of them had already turned to ashes. Only 60 to 70 sheets remained unburned. Gu and Ma, along with sixteen men and women who were gambling, and the gambling money, were taken to the police station. According to their confessions, the main flower club was located in Caojiadu, and the other three people in charge have escaped. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Local Court, where Lawyer Qian Xunjiu of the Police Station filed a lawsuit according to law, requesting that they be severely punished. Judge Meng ruled that Gu A'er be sentenced to ten months' imprisonment, Ma Rongsheng to eight months' imprisonment, and the remaining ten be fined 20 yuan each or sentenced to 20 days of labor each. The gambling money and flower club papers were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Co-Heir Burned to Death: Relatives Accuse Factory Owner of Death by Negligence</h3>
<p>Liu Qizhou, owner of the Yongfeng Wenji Hardware and Electrical Factory on Weihaiwei Road, has recently been accused of death by negligence and other charges by Wang Haiqian, who retained a lawyer and filed a case with the criminal division of the First Special Court. The plaintiff stated that his son, Qiaosheng, 16 years old, was an apprentice in the defendant's factory. At around 5:00 AM on December 24th last year, a fire broke out in the factory. Qiaosheng heard the alarm and immediately called his companions to report to the factory owner, Liu Qizhou (because the Liu family also lived in the factory). Liu ordered Qiaosheng and others to move important books and documents from the accounting room, back and forth several times. On the last trip, he was lost in the smoke and burned to death (four other apprentices were also burned to death). Afterwards, Liu hired workers to retrieve four bodies. Upon hearing the news, the plaintiff went to the factory, which was already a pile of rubble. The body was sent to the coroner's office and placed in the Xihai Funeral Home, but he refused to claim it. Qiaosheng was the co-heir of the plaintiff and his brother's families, and his 80-year-old grandmother was still alive. Upon hearing the tragic news, she was overwhelmed with grief. The defendant knew that the fire was already dangerous, yet he still asked them to move items, resulting in this tragic death. This constitutes a violation of Articles 282 and 491 of the Criminal Code, and it is requested that the defendant be ordered to pay 400 yuan per year until the age of 60, totaling 17,600 yuan. Yesterday morning, the case was interrogated by Judge Chuan. The defendant retained Lawyer E Sen to defend him. As a result, Liu Qizhou was found not guilty, and the attached civil lawsuit was dismissed.</p>
<h3>Gathering in Tea House: Plotting Illegal Activities; Detectives Arrest Suspects; Handguns and Bullets Seized</h3>
<p>Zhou Honglin, a Chinese detective in the general inspection department of the Public Concession police, learned that several members of a robbery gang were planning to gather at the Jubao Lou teahouse at No. 411 Shanhaiguan Road yesterday to plot illegal activities. He reported this to Liu Shaokui, the chief Chinese detective, and together with Chinese detective Zhu Shuling, they rushed to arrest three men from Jiangbei, Lu Yuanyu, Hu Debiao, and Yan Deyin, on the 6th.

It was found that they had robbed property from No. 51, Lane 417, Xiaoshadu Road, and No. 403, Xinjiapo Road, and the Yihe Pawnshop. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court.

<h3>From a Young Age, Engaged by Matchmakers; Now Seeking to Dissolve the Engagement: Zhu Qiutao Dissatisfied with Fiancee; Jurisdictional Issues Require Evidence</h3>
<p>Song Xiuzhu, younger sister of Song Zhenhua, a post office employee from Chuansha working in the French Concession on Rue Massenet, was betrothed to Zhu Qiutao, a fellow townsman with the surname Zhu, by her parents through matchmakers when she was young. At that time, Qiutao was only ten years old. Both children were ignorant and never expressed any opinions. Later, as they grew older, they maintained regular correspondence and never showed any dislike. Now that they are both adults, Zhu Qiutao</p>
<p>Suddenly Raises Objections</p>
<p>Repeatedly seeking to dissolve the engagement. However, due to the other party's disagreement, the matter remained unresolved. After the war, the counties in Pudong fell into enemy hands, and the Zhu family moved to No. 11 Kangti Lane, Kangti Road, in the French Concession of this city. Recently, they learned that the fiancee, Song Xiuzhu, had also sought refuge in Shanghai and was living with her brother at No. 512 Xin Dagulu in the International Settlement. Consequently, they hired lawyer Qian Zheng to file a petition with the First Special District Court, seeking</p>
<p>Mediation to Annul the Agreement</p>
<p>However, the mediation failed because Miss Song could not be served with the summons. Lawyer Qian then represented his client in filing a lawsuit against Miss Song, seeking confirmation that the engagement was invalid. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ni opened the court to summon the defendant. Miss Song Xiuzhu still did not appear in court, but her lawyer appeared and stated that the case's jurisdiction</p>
<p>Still Had Issues</p>
<p>And requested that this point be investigated first, because the defendant still resides in her hometown with her widowed mother. However, the plaintiff's lawyer argued that the defendant's lawyer was engaging in</p>
<p>Empty Claims</p>
<p>Saying that there was a witness who could prove that the defendant was indeed living with her brother, Song Zhenhua, on Xin Dagulu. Zhang, who lived in the same house as the plaintiff, testified in court that he had gone to Song Zhenhua's residence and saw Song Xiuzhu in the house. The court then ordered the defendant's lawyer to present evidence regarding the jurisdictional issue and adjourned the hearing to February 14th.</p>
<h3>Pudong Wharf Laborer Shot and Killed; Japanese Troops Indiscriminately Fired on the Innocent</h3>
<p>Wang Quansheng, a native of Shandong, was 48 years old. He had been working as a laborer at various shipping wharves in Pudong. He lived at No. 25 Renheli, Xicun Lane, Zhoujiadu, Pudong. On the afternoon of the 5th of this month at 8:00 PM, during the Japanese troops' curfew hours, when people were prohibited from traveling at night, Wang was passing by the entrance of Xicun Lane, Zhoujiadu, near his residence. A Japanese soldier spotted him and, considering his appearance suspicious, opened fire without asking any questions. He was shot in the waist and fell to the ground. Wang, though wounded, crawled back to his residence. Due to the late hour and the Japanese troops' curfew in the area, and the lack of nearby hospitals, his family only managed to help him cross the river to Shanghai the next day and hire a car to take him to Yihe Hospital at No. 200 Rue Albert in the French Concession for treatment. Due to the severity of his injuries, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 5:00 PM. The hospital reported the death to the French police as usual, who sent detectives to investigate. The body was transported to the Tongren Fuyuan Sub-hall for an autopsy. Yesterday, the French police reported the case to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic doctor went to the hall, confirming that the deceased, Wang Quansheng, died from a gunshot wound. Wang Liu, the deceased's wife, filed a report requesting to claim the body for burial after signing a guarantee.</p>
<h3>Robbery in the Village of Fahua: Several Homes Robbed in One Night</h3>
<p>The Yu Yan Paper Shop at No. 773, Xizhen, Fahua, Shanghai West, was suddenly entered by more than ten robbers around 6:00 PM the night before. They spoke with a Kejia accent and wore clothing of various lengths. They each carried handguns and Mauser pistols.

<h3>Village Woman Seduced into Adultery; Accuses Foreman of Abandonment; Demanding Payment for Living and Educational Expenses for Mother and Daughters; Foreman Denies Allegations, Court Orders Out-of-Court Mediation</h3>
<p>Liang Lu (also known as A Yi), a 32-year-old Guangdong woman residing at No. 361 Beijiangxi Road, recently hired lawyer Gan Lin to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the First Special Court, accusing Liang Deqiang, a Cantonese man residing at No. 72 behind the Daxin Company on Rue Lloyd, of seduction and abandonment. The grounds for the lawsuit were that the plaintiff was an uneducated, old-fashioned village woman with limited knowledge. Over ten years ago, she came to Shanghai with relatives and was</p>
<p>Seduced Into Adultery</p>
<p>By the defendant, who was from the same hometown, and began cohabitating. They had a daughter. However, the defendant became bored over time and abandoned her once. The plaintiff, without means of support, formally married Gu Tingguang, a fellow townsman. However, the defendant, who was a foreman at the Ruirong Iron Factory in Yangshupu, became jealous upon learning of the plaintiff's marriage and wanted to rekindle their relationship. Relying on his large group of followers and ample resources, he repeatedly threatened and beat the plaintiff's husband, threatening to kill him. The husband,</p>
<p>Unable to Endure the Suffering</p>
<p>Reached a settlement through mediation, with the defendant providing funds for him to return to Guangdong to avoid conflict. She then resumed cohabitation with the defendant, bearing one son and two daughters. Besides one son and one daughter who died young, there are now a seven-year-old eldest daughter and a three-year-old youngest daughter. If they could live together from then on, it would have been somewhat comforting. However, the defendant relapsed and, in August of the lunar calendar this year, abandoned her again, leaving the mother and three daughters without regard for their livelihood. For months, they have been displaced and suffered greatly.</p>
<p>Lives in Danger</p>
<p>The defendant's actions constitute crimes under Articles 293 and 294 of the Criminal Code. She also requested that the court order a one-time payment of 3,360 yuan, the minimum living expenses of ten yuan per month until she reaches the age of sixty, and child support of five yuan per month for both daughters until they reach adulthood, totaling 780 yuan for the eldest daughter and 1,020 yuan for the youngest daughter, for a total of 5,160 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Huang Risheng summoned the plaintiff, Liang Lu, and her two daughters to court. She testified as before. The defendant, accompanied by a lawyer, also appeared in court and</p>
<p>Denied the Allegations</p>
<p>Stating that the plaintiff and defendant were originally from the same hometown and known to each other. After she came to Shanghai, she first cohabited with Lu Ning for several years, and then became acquainted with Gu Tingguang. Gu, being a small vendor, had insufficient income, so the plaintiff would occasionally borrow money from the defendant. Later, the defendant refused, leading to the lawsuit out of resentment, etc. After reviewing the testimonies, Judge Huang ordered the case to be rescheduled to the 16th for both parties to mediate out of court. If mediation fails, further review will be conducted.</p>
<h3>Former Capital Ballroom Accused in Two Cases</h3>
<p>When Yongbo youth rich businessman Chuan Xuelin, namely Chuan Zhuangnian, and his fellow townsman Zhang Shaozong, namely Jiang Xiaozhong, jointly opened the Dujing ballroom on Malong Road in the French Concession, Zhang Qian was appointed manager, Chuan served as an assistant, and lawyer Ji Chao was appointed legal advisor, also entrusted with handling litigation matters during the business operation. Nearly 500 yuan of public expenses were not paid, because the ballroom closed after operating for less than two months. The attorney's fees owed to Ji were not paid, despite repeated letters requesting payment, Now, lawyer Ji Chao has filed a petition with the Civil Mediation Office of the Second Special Court, requesting mediation with Chuan Xuelin and Zhang Shaozong, seeking payment of the legal fees. The court accepted the petition, and yesterday morning, Judge Chen opened the court for mediation. Because the opposing parties, Chuan and Zhang, did not appear, the court ordered the mediation to fail and instructed the petitioner to formally file a lawsuit. Chuan and Zhang were also sued in the Second Special Court for owing debts to the La Dahua Ballroom, which they have not paid. The original and defendant parties have been served summonses and are scheduled to be heard in the Seventh Court tomorrow.</p>
<h3>Barber's Late-Night Noise Leads to Murder; Five Individuals Involved Arrested; Awaiting Autopsy Before Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>After finishing work on the evening of the 4th of this month, barbers from a barbershop at No. 665 Hankou Road began singing in various dialects, creating excessive noise. Workers from the Cuihua Printing House, located behind the barbershop at No. 28 Yideli, Zhejiang Road, intending to rest and sleep after a day of hard work, were disturbed by the singing and questioned them, saying that they should not be making such merry at night and disturbing people's sleep. The barbers, unwilling to back down, argued and insulted each other. The barbers then rushed into Cuihua Printing House, leading to a major brawl. After the police arrived, they were all arrested and taken to the Laozha police station, where they were scolded by the police chief and released. However, Lin Fusheng (also known as Lin Shiji), one of the barbers, suddenly felt injured afterward and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Unexpectedly, he died on the night before last. Five barbers and printing house workers who were related to the case, including Mei Chunhua, Wang Delin, Lu Ziquan, Yang Sanduo, and Zhu Shengzhang, were arrested. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi stated that the cause of death of the deceased needed to be determined by an autopsy before the court could decide who was responsible. Therefore, he requested that the defendants be temporarily detained pending further investigation. After review, Judge Feng Shide ordered the defendants to be detained for further interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Fake "City Government Secretary" Kidnapped; Still Missing Yesterday; Two Strong Men Helped Him Into a Car; So-Called Captain is a Fang</h3>
<p>Tang Wenwu, the fake "City Government Secretary," who is over fifty years old, originally lived in Fanli, Pudong. After the fake "City Government" moved to Jiangwan, Tang also moved to Hongkou. The day before yesterday morning, Tang and Chen Boqiao, a fake official from the fake "Social Affairs Bureau," were next to the fake "Bus Stop" north of the Waitanyuan Bridge, planning to take a bus to the fake "City Government," when two strong men suddenly approached Tang. They claimed to be dismissed fake "Guard Team police officers" and said that, according to orders from above, they requested he accompany them for a conversation. Tang asked what it was about, but the two men did not answer. They only produced a letter from their sleeves and handed it to Tang to read. After Tang finished reading, he tried to escape, but the two strong men drew their guns, ordered him to stop, and helped him into a car that was parked on the side of the road, which then sped away. Although Chen, the fake official, was not kidnapped, he was glared at, scaring him into running away. Since this incident occurred, the fake "City Government" and other collaborators have become panicked. As of last night, the fake "Secretary" was still missing. It was reported that when the incident occurred, the two strong men said, "Our Captain Fang wants to see you." Therefore, it is known that the so-called captain is named Fang. The Japanese and puppet authorities have been investigating for two days without any leads.</p>

<h3>Police Bust Large-Scale Coal Thieves; "Floating Dock" Intercepted in Suzhou Creek; Large Quantities of Stolen Coal and Account Books Seized</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War and the westward relocation of the National Army, more than ten fugitives from Tongzhou, including Mu Jiang, Zhu Xigen, and Zhong Agen, seized the opportunity to organize a large-scale theft operation at No. 7, Lane 476, North Suzhou Road. They hired a large barge at a certain location and docked it in Suzhou Creek (named "Floating Dock"). Using several small boats, they dispatched dozens of accomplices to the war zones in Pudong and Hongkou to</p>
<p>Steal in the Dead of Night</p>
<p>Stealing large quantities of white coal from various coal yards and transporting it to the large floating dock in Suzhou Creek for storage. The operation was equipped with telephone number 43921 and rented two trucks, numbers 23346 and 23425, from the Xiechang Truck Company at No. 334 Mingde Village, Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession. Brokers then distributed the stolen coal to coal shops in the British and French Concessions, amounting to more than ten thousand dollars in value,</p>
<p>A Thriving Business</p>
<p>Until recently, when Huishan Police detectives Huang Fugen, Wang Tongpo, Zhao Yongqing, and others learned of this. They reported the matter to the police chief and, in cooperation with Western detectives, secretly went to Suzhou Creek at noon the day before yesterday. They seized the large barge used as the floating dock, which contained dozens of loads of coal. Near North Suzhou Road and Zhejiang Road, they found seven men from Tongzhou, including Lu Ruigen, Wang Asan, Lu Sanlang, Lu Erlang, Zhao Yueming, Wu Chunsheng, and Zhao Zhangquan, loading 25 baskets of white coal onto two trucks, intending to</p>
<p>Peddle It Elsewhere</p>
<p>The detectives arrested Lu Ruigen and the other six men and went to the operation's location to confiscate a list of workers. The list showed that a certain foreman had skimmed coal (known as "black eats black"), and was fined 50 yuan by the operation as a warning. They also seized account books and other items, which were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a public prosecution on charges of theft, requesting a postponement to question the defendants. Their testimonies were evasive. Judge Huang Risheng ordered them to remain in custody for further review in seven days.</p>

<h3>Kerosene Tank Transporting Soil Case: Xiong Youqing Remanded; Sentencing on the 14th</h3>
<p>Xiong Youqing, also known as Youqing, a 31-year-old native of Hubei, was found driving a Xiang Sheng car carrying three iron kerosene tanks at the intersection of Rue de Consulat and Rue Amiral Bayle at 4:00 PM on January 8th of this year.

<h3>Finding a Discarded Check; How Can We Help the Refugees?</h3>
<p>Hoping "Cifu" (Blessings) Will Come to Our Office to Retrieve It Yesterday, someone signing as "Cifu" sent a letter to this newspaper, along with a 70-yuan check from the China United Business Company (number 2155). The original letter stated, "To whom it may concern, I found a check on Avenue Edward VII yesterday. I do not know who lost it, and I dare not take what is not rightfully mine. Therefore, I am enclosing it to you. After announcing it in the newspaper, please deposit it into the refugee fund to help the refugees. I am enclosing the check and ask your newspaper to announce it. Sincerely, Cifu."</p>
<p>This newspaper believes that we cannot simply send the found check to the refugee fund. We must seek the issuer's consent to be legal. However, after investigation, the "China United Business Company" has ceased operations, so this check has become waste paper and cannot be donated to refugees. We hope "Cifu" will come to the office to retrieve the check and send it to the police.</p>
<h3>Paramount Department Store Scheduled to Open on the 10th; Hosted Press Last Night</h3>
<p>The Jing'an Temple Paramount Department Store, appearing in a new form, is scheduled to officially open on the 10th of the month (the day after tomorrow). The opening ceremony will be extremely grand. Currently, the interior of the department store is being renovated day and night, and the garden layout is also gradually taking shape. Mr. Yang Cunguo, the manager of the department store, hosted a reception for reporters from major newspapers in Shanghai last night at the Atlantic Restaurant, with about fifty people attending. The event was a great success, and it ended around 9:00 PM. The department store will host a banquet for participating manufacturers at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA tonight, and a banquet for related parties tomorrow night. The following is a transcript of the speech given by Mr. Yang at the beginning of the Paramount Department Store project: The motivation for establishing Paramount Department Store may not be clear to the outside world, who may think this is a speculative business. However, since the War of Resistance began, we have felt the decline of people's livelihood and the abnormal state of commerce. Shanghai now presents a special prosperity, but this is partial and deformed. In particular, consumers feel that their purchasing power is insufficient, which proves that the current prosperity will not last forever. In this concept, we decided to establish this Paramount Department Store. We will cooperate with producers and consumers with 12% sincerity, and at the same time establish a strict lineup of national products, use the lowest-waste price to suit the consumer's purchasing power, and use the most sophisticated goods to meet the needs of all Shanghai people. We also know that the western district is Shanghai's residential area, but the shops are unusually scattered. Occasionally, you have to drive to get what you want. The loss of this car is already considerable, especially in the Caojiadu Robertson Road area. In the case of buses and trolleybuses, it is difficult to get to the east district to buy an item, so we selected the vacant land next to the Paramount Ballroom next to Jing'an Temple and built such a Paramount Department Store. This is the transportation hub, which can bring a lot of convenience to the residents of the western district. Now, the shops participating are the most famous manufacturers, so it can be said that the goods are noble, but the prices are civilianized. We admire Mr. Kuang Zhongmou's perseverance and the spirit of the Penglai Market he hosted. Now that Penglai Market has become a trace of the past, it is really a pity and the most painful thing, so we will move forward with extremely firm aspirations to follow in Mr. Kuang's footsteps and create a new force for the Chinese cargo industry. It is by no means a temporary speculation, especially in this turbulent era. We think that the business community needs this driving force even more.</p>

<p>A Glimpse of the Competition: The competition began immediately, using the world rules of 21 points per game and divided into three rounds. In the first round, the five Shanghai female players lived up to their mission, displaying great power and overwhelming the Jewish players, who could only defend and had no power to counterattack, resulting in a crushing defeat of 0-5. In the second round, the Jewish players struggled a bit more. Shanghai's Yuan Lianru performed poorly and was defeated by the Jewish team's main player, Ms. Difei, with a score of 21-15. However, Lin Jinlan, Cai Xiuyu, Xiao Weiqing, and Liang Yujie each used swift topspin shots to win the second round 4-1. In the third round, the Shanghai women were eager to win, and the Jewish players tried hard to catch up. Both sides had excellent performances, but the Shanghai women won again 4-1. In summary, the Shanghai Chinese Mixed Team won a major victory with a score of 13-2. A doubles performance was given at the end, but no scores were recorded.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results: First Round 5-0; Second Round 4-1; Third Round 4-1.</p>

<h3>Finance: Many Eager to Take Profits; Cash Prices Rise and Then Retreat</h3>
<p>Highest Point Reached 2065 Yuan; Over 1200 Taels Traded</p>
<p>Yesterday's cash gold bar market saw volatile fluctuations, with the general trend being strong at first and then weakening. Initially, the momentum from the previous day continued, and news of continued tightness in foreign exchange, coupled with initial reports of strong buying interest in securities, pushed the opening price to 2065 yuan, nearly breaking the high of 2068 yuan on November 28th of last year. Later, however, currency exchange businesses suddenly acted on behalf of clients holding actual capital, trending towards profit-taking, and securities firms also switched from buying to selling, resulting in a sudden sense of oversupply and a price drop. Subsequently, a certain currency exchange business unexpectedly resumed buying, and a certain gold firm continued to purchase aggressively. However, sentiment was affected by news that HSBC was maintaining the bond price at 8 1/8 pence for the British gold market, leading to widespread profit-taking. The securities firms were also very active in short selling, preventing the price from rising. As a result, the price only rose by 3 yuan. The volume of central gold transactions remained high, but there were no significant fluctuations. Trading was brisk, with 1240 taels traded. Jewelry gold prices were raised by 1 yuan in the morning due to the initial strength of the cash gold bar market. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold continued to decline.</p>
<p>Cash Gold Bar Market Sees New High Price</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially continued the momentum from the previous day, and foreign exchange rates were also reported to be tight. This strengthened market sentiment, and buyers bid 2065 yuan. A small number of sellers bid 70 yuan. At that time, the jewelry firms suddenly dumped their holdings, selling 50 taels to the securities firms at 2065.9 yuan, the opening price, which was 11 yuan higher than the previous day's high. Although foreign exchange rates continued to weaken after the opening, profit-taking emerged. A certain currency exchange business first sold 70 taels on behalf of a client to a certain gold firm at 60 yuan. It also sold 50 taels each to currency exchange firms, securities firms, and jewelry firms, all at 60 yuan. Subsequently, another currency exchange business also sold on behalf of a local client, selling 50 taels each to a certain firm and to fellow businesses at the same price. After this, buyers became scarce, and the price broke below the 60 yuan mark. A gold firm sold 20 taels to a currency exchange business, and currency exchange businesses traded 50 taels among themselves, both at 56 yuan. At that time, a certain gold firm resumed buying, and the price gradually recovered. A certain gold firm bought 50 taels from a securities firm at 58 yuan. A currency exchange firm bought 50 taels from a jewelry firm at 59 yuan. The gold firm then bought 100 taels from a currency exchange firm at 58 yuan. Later, the currency exchange firm sold 50 taels to a jewelry firm at 57 yuan. Another currency exchange firm bought 50 taels from a jewelry firm at 59 yuan. Finally, a gold firm bought 50 taels from a currency exchange firm at 58.5 yuan, the closing price for the morning. In the afternoon, news that foreign exchange rates had stopped tightening and begun to strengthen, and that HSBC was maintaining the price of British gold at 8 1/8 pence, slightly weakened market sentiment. However, a certain currency exchange business suddenly resumed large-scale buying. Fortunately, securities firms, jewelry firms, and currency exchange firms were still willing to sell, so there was little change. A certain currency exchange business bought 50 taels from a fellow business at 57 yuan. It then aggressively bought over 200 taels at 57 yuan and 56 yuan, all supplied by securities firms. Later, the securities firms sold 50 taels to a certain currency exchange business at 55.5 yuan, the lowest price. After this, the gold firm resumed buying, and the price stopped falling and began to rise. The gold firm bought 50 taels from a fellow business at 57 yuan. Finally, a certain currency exchange business bought 50 taels from a fellow business at 2057 yuan, the closing price for the evening, 3 yuan higher than the previous day. The price difference for the entire day was 9.5 yuan. The selling price for cash gold at gold firms was 2065 yuan, and the buying price was 2050 yuan. The spot gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, and there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Rises to 209 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange rate for jewelry gold per tael initially remained unchanged. When the cash gold bar price broke through the 60 yuan mark at 9:42 AM, the jewelry firms also raised their prices by 1 yuan. Datonghang and Lao Qingyun changed their prices to 209 yuan, while Xinhanghang changed theirs to 207 yuan, buying at 201 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Continues to Shrink by One and a Half Pence</p>
<p>A London telegram on the 6th reported that British pure gold continued to shrink by one and a half pence per ounce, falling to 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5 and a half pence. As a result, the Central Bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold also decreased to 1211.9 yuan. The listed price for Customs gold also decreased slightly by 0.2%, a decrease of 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai standard spot gold price also fell by 1 yuan, to 1207.4 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Currency Sells Well; External Demand Remains High; Boycott is Just Empty Talk</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold continued to fall by 1.5 pence, and the British-American exchange rate rose by .06875. Foreign exchange rates continued to decline due to strong demand in North China and insufficient supply from banks. The cash gold bar market opened strong, but subsequent profit-taking by gold firms and jewelry businesses caused prices to gradually decline. Later, prices rebounded as firms bought at low prices. Observing the future, gold prices may still experience turbulence. British gold pounds and gold notes were heavily sold, but strong demand continued, and trading was brisk. Japanese gold notes are widely used in the market. There have been reports of a boycott to show retaliation, but most people in the industry are foolish and pursue profits. This talk is probably just idle chatter from patriotic individuals. Public association trading was still strong. Litong sold US gold notes to Yongsheng for 200 yuan. Chengtai sold British gold notes to Tongjin for 100 pounds and also sold British gold notes to Santaijin for 100 pounds. Jindada sold British gold pounds to Hongchangjin for 100 pounds. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: British gold pounds rose by 2 jiao and 5 fen, British gold notes rose by 2 jiao and 1 fen, US gold notes rose by 2 fen, Hong Kong notes rose by 7 li, French franc notes rose by 5 hao, Singapore notes and Dutch notes each rose by 2 fen, Canadian notes rose by 2 fen, and Philippine notes rose by 3.5 fen. Italian notes fell by 1 fen. Only US gold pounds, Annam notes, rupee notes, German gold notes, Australian gold notes, and Siamese notes remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Significant Fluctuations in Foreign Exchange Rates; Heavy Settlement Volume and Influx of Outsiders; Tight to Loose, British Tight and American Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange market saw heavy settlement volumes from major oil and shipping companies, along with continued buying activity from Japanese banks. Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu and Chinese yarn and cloth businesses also suddenly began buying, leading to potentially tight conditions. The British gold rate once fell to 8 1/8 pence, and the US exchange rate also weakened to 15.84375 yuan. However, the market eventually loosened as foreign banks competed to supply currency. As a result, the British rate tightened by .03125, while the US rate remained unchanged. However, there were significant fluctuations throughout the day, and trading remained brisk. The Hong Kong exchange rate continued to decline by .00375 due to weak selling interest from currency exchange businesses and strong buying interest from foreign banks.</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's large bills, both near and far, were flat, and New York's silver prices remained unchanged. London's raw gold continued to shrink by 1.5 pence. The British-American exchange rate was up 5.6 cents, the British-French rate was up 10 centimes, and the British-Shanghai rate was down .0625. The American-British rate was up 5.6 cents, the American-French rate was up .25, and the American-Shanghai rate was down 1 jiao and 9 fen. The Central Bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. The banks opened early, and the spot selling prices were: British exchange 8 1/8 pence, American exchange 15.9375 yuan, up .03125 from the previous closing price for both British and American. After the opening, Chinese yarn and cloth businesses first bought HSBC British gold at 8 1/8 pence. Then, Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu and Asiatic settled with HSBC Huabi British gold at 8 1/8 pence, weakening the market to 8 1/4. The HSBC listing was unchanged, and there were no changes in the silver balance tax. After that, a certain shipping company and Japanese banks bought and settled HSBC American Bank Huabi American exchange at 15.9375 yuan, tightening the market to 15.9. Then, Texaco and Mobil also competed to buy profitable American Bank American exchange at only 15.9, tightening the market to 15.84375 yuan. Later, a certain shipping company bought HSBC British gold at only 8 1/8 pence, making the market quite tight. Finally, currency exchange businesses sold Dutch and Hong Kong exchanges to Ander at 54.5 yuan and .00625. The trend then gradually flattened.</p>
<p>Later, the Ge-Yangxing shipping company bought profitable Macalari British gold at 8 1/8 pence. Later, the market loosened slightly as foreign banks continued to supply currency and buying and settlement activity decreased. HSBC sold British gold to a shipping company at 8 1/8 pence. Following that, Dutch and American banks also sold American exchange to a shipping company at 15.9. Because foreign banks were eager to buy and currency exchange businesses were unwilling to sell cheaply, the Hong Kong exchange rate was slightly higher. Huayi bought Hong Kong exchange from a currency exchange business at 54.7. At the close of the evening, the bank selling prices were British exchange 8 1/8 and American exchange 15.9, down .03125 for British and flat for American from the previous close. The Hong Kong exchange rate was down .00375. A record of the day's trading is listed below.</p>
<h3>Discount Rates Lower</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for bills and notes became progressively lower. In the morning, it was as low as 34.75 yuan per 1000 yuan, 35 yuan at noon, and it fell again in the afternoon, dropping to a low of 34.5 yuan at one point. Finally, it was 34.75 yuan, down another half yuan from the 7th.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Prices Both Flat</h3>
<p>A London telegram on the 6th reported that India was buying and the mainland was selling, with buyers being content and the market stable. The market was slightly sluggish after the close. The long-term silver contracts, both near and far, were unchanged. A New York silver telegram reported that the American silver price remained stable. Also, a Bombay silver telegram reported that the Indian silver market was calm, with both spot and near-term contracts unchanged.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Bonds Trend Lower Again; Foreign Bonds Continue to Rise; Huashang Cement Pays Dividend of 16%; Anglo-German Continued Loan to Issue Principal and Interest</h3>
<p>In the securities grey market, the rumors of the previous day and the inability to confirm the new loan continued to prevent morale from rising. It was widely rumored that a certain major player had been selling off hundreds of thousands in the past few days, all transactions by a certain politician. With such a large outflow of spot goods, reliance on small retail investors for absorption was deemed insufficient. With the Type A lottery approaching, the market was unable to make a strong recovery, and the prospects seemed difficult to be optimistic about. Most major players were waiting for an opportunity to take action and sell at high prices. If the market experienced several rounds of pressure, recovery would be doubly difficult.</p>
<p>The market activity yesterday was mostly dull, without breaking out of the sideways and weakening trend. Initially, number 20 helped major players cover short positions, and Tian Sheng also bought, making the market seem relatively strong. Later, however, the market suffered a setback due to heavy selling by Tongkang. The results at midday were mixed, and morale was weakening. The market was even weaker in the afternoon, with only Xinfeng Yong slightly covering short positions. On the selling side, numbers 7, 35, and Runli had a dominant position, and the market price became unstable and began to weaken. With the lunar year ending in a few days, most people were watching and waiting. The results yesterday showed a uniform decline of 4 to 5 jiao, with a total transaction volume of approximately 700,000 to 800,000 yuan. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>Stock transactions were not numerous. There was a transaction of 100 Zhabei Water and Electricity shares at a price of 6 yuan and 5 jiao and 5 fen. Huashang Shanghai Cement Company began paying dividends for the year 1937 starting yesterday (the 6th), including official bonuses and 8% annual interest, for a total annual interest rate of 16%.</p>
<p>London's listed market prices for Chinese foreign bonds on Monday, the 6th of this month, continued to rise slightly, increasing by 1/2 pound and 1 pound. Bonds that increased by 1/2 pound were British Indemnity Bonds, British-issued bonds, with a price of 48 pounds. Bonds that increased by 1 pound were German-issued Hukuang Railway Bonds, with a price of 21 pounds. Bonds that increased by 1/2 pound were the Longhai and Jinghu Railway Bonds, with the former priced at 13.5 pounds and the latter at 22 pounds. The rest were unchanged. Market activity included 2,000 pounds of German-issued British Indemnity Bonds, with a transaction price of 44 pounds, up 1/2 pound from the previous week's selling price. Actual British supply and demand was also very active. 4,500 pounds of British-issued Central Indemnity Bonds were sold at 49 pounds, 1 pound higher than the market price. Also, 1,000 pounds of German-issued bonds were sold at 45 pounds and 9 shillings, 1 pound and 5 shillings higher than the transaction price. Also, 2,000 pounds of Russian-issued bonds were sold at 43 pounds and 15 shillings, 1 pound and 5 shillings higher than the previous offering. 3,000 pounds of Sino-French American Dollar 5% Bonds (equivalent to 15,000 US dollars) were sold at 68 British pounds, a parallel market price of 63.875 US dollars. 5,000 pounds of German-issued Tianjin-Pukou Railway Reissued Bonds were sold at 16 pounds and 5 shillings, 5 shillings higher than the market price. 2,500 pounds of Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway Bonds were sold at 18.5 pounds, a parallel market price. 3,000 pounds of non-German-issued Hukuang Railway Bonds were sold at 21.5 pounds, 1/2 pound lower than the market price. Also, there was a bid to buy 1,000 pounds at no more than 18 pounds, with the two sides fearing a close alignment. The general trend of the market was that upper-end bonds were slightly firmer, but lower-end railway bonds remained weak.</p>
<p>Principal and Interest of Anglo-German Continued Loan. According to a Reuters report from London on the 7th, the 41st lot of Anglo-German 4.5% Continued Loan of 1898 bonds drawn (drawn in London on January 3rd of this year) had a total principal to be repaid of 670,225 British pounds. The 82nd coupon had a total interest to be paid of 82,499 pounds, 12 shillings, and 6 pence. All payments are scheduled to begin on March 1st at the HSBC Bank in London.</p>
<p>London's listed market prices for British-owned Jardine Matheson stocks on Monday, the 6th of this month, showed that HSBC shares were priced after deducting a dividend of 3 pounds. The new price for British-registered shares was 81 pounds and 15 shillings, and the new price for Hong Kong-registered shares was 83.5 pounds. The Kaiping Coal Mine bearer shares rose by 9 pence to 17 shillings and 3 pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>A Table of Chinese Government Bonds compiled by the Shanghai Main Branch of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the third revised edition of 1939, has been published. It contains detailed information on over 130 types of central, provincial, municipal, and corporate bonds, and includes an article on China's new government bonds of the past year. The content is rich, and the figures are accurate, making it an important reference material. Those interested in domestic and foreign bonds can request it from the Trust Department Service Section of the bank.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cloth: Yarn Factories Open Sales at High Prices; Another 3200 Bales Yesterday</h3>
<p>Recently, the yarn market has not actively risen, but the trend is exceptionally stable. Once it fluctuates within the 400 yuan range, South China's demand for coarse and fine yarn continues unabated. At the same time, the financial community has a strong concept of stockpiling cotton textiles due to the abundance of liquid funds, and the market has been swept clean of all floating chips, making the market increasingly solid. As for the yarn factories, they are opening sales continuously at high prices, keeping pace with the times, and the forward sales for March and April of next year are also surging. The situation and quantities of each yarn opened by various factories yesterday are listed below.</p>
<h3>Large Firms Return to Purchase, Double Horse Yarn Reaches Peak Again: 406 Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially rose, then weakened, with a tight trend. This was mainly because the actual demand was still not weak, but it was less than the previous day. Therefore, when the rise was excessive, some people who had made profits came to sell their holdings. For a time, the chips were slightly loose, and the market price immediately decreased. The high price of 20-count Double Horse yarn reappeared at 406 yuan, meeting the peak price of January 15th. Because of this, the short-term speculators took the opportunity to exit and prices fell back. At the same time, factories opened sales one after another due to high prices, without interruption throughout the day. It was found that the Xinsheng Yarn Factory, a newly established factory with approximately ten thousand plus yarn spindles, yesterday opened a large sale of one thousand bales at the Yarn Industry Association, with a price of 390 yuan, for a three-to-four-month term. Purchasers paid a deposit of 30 yuan per bale, and the initial receipt of 30,000 yuan in deposit money caused many parties to relax a little. However, according to the market, a Mr. Wu suddenly came to purchase several hundred bales of 20-count Double Horse spot yarn, and the market situation stabilized again. It was also said that this firm successively absorbed about 6,000 bales of cotton yarn, all with advances paid at the warehouse, resulting in considerable profits. It was found that their purchase price started at 318 yuan and continued to buy until now. According to this, the profits should be considerable.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened in the morning with very enthusiastic sentiment. Because the demand in the Nanhua area was frequent the previous day, people's confidence was strong. Spot traders were unanimously optimistic. Double Horse opened up by two yuan, reaching 406 yuan. A rough transaction was done at 407 yuan, and transactions among peers were extremely lively. Shortly after, it was heard that various factories had opened sales of about two to three thousand bales, causing the market sentiment to flatten out a bit. The selling price of Double Horse suddenly fell, with the lowest price reaching 403 yuan. Then, Mr. Wu entrusted others to suddenly buy, and the market price gradually recovered to close at 403.5 yuan. It was found that the transaction volume in the morning totaled 1,578 bales, compared to 245 bales the previous day, totaling 1,823 bales. The price of 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 1.5 yuan compared to the previous day, Shepherd rose by 3.5 yuan, Heavenly Maiden rose by 0.5 yuan, Double Globe rose by 2.5 yuan, Special Golden City remained flat, and 10-count coarse yarn rose by 3 to 4 yuan. The purchase volume of each group is listed on the left:</p>
<p>The supplementary record of the afternoon closing transactions the day before yesterday is as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market remained dull as before, and the market conditions did not differ much from the previous day. Due to the previous squeeze in the transaction of raw hides for the next month, everyone was cautious and dared not try, and it was completely in a state of stagnation. The spot price of 20-count Water Moon yarn was 329 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count Blue Phoenix yarn was 323.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Cotton Transactions Become More Sluggish</h3>
<p>In the foreign cotton market, New York cotton prices remained sluggish as all firms adopted a wait-and-see attitude due to the unresolved issue of Washington loan cotton sales. Yesterday, New York initially rose due to good overseas cotton prices, which caused firms to have a small amount of trading. Later, some southern firms covered their sales, and the New Orleans group sold, and cotton prices weakened at closing, falling by one or two points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton, including forecasts, fell by one rupee, and Egyptian cotton fell by sixteen points. Yesterday, the exchange rate contracted, converting into legal tender, and the price of American and Brazilian cotton rose by 0.6 yuan per dan, Indian cotton rose by 0.5 yuan, and Egyptian cotton fell by 0.4 yuan.</p>
<p>In the Shanghai foreign cotton market, it is feared that there will not be much transaction volume within the year. Yesterday, only Anda ordered 200 bales of Indian cotton Bellas, with a delivered factory price of 72 yuan. This cotton can be used for spinning 24-count yarn. On the Japanese factory side, only Gongda imported 300 bales of Brazilian cotton. The cotton prices yesterday are listed below:</p>
<p>The local cotton business is becoming increasingly depressed. All parties are preparing to end the year, so transactions are completely in a state of stagnation. Factory sentiment is particularly scattered, and there is nothing exciting in the market. The market situation is dull and stable. Once business starts, the market will continue to rise. Recently, the foreign exchange rate has tightened, and the combined price of foreign cotton has risen slightly. The source of goods from the Subei area is still slightly weak. The goods arriving at the wharf include 2,789 bales of Tong cotton, 150 pieces from Beisha, and 220 pieces from Baimao. The spot cotton transaction record is listed on the left:</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Too Much Stock in Haiphong, Fewer Orders from Sichuan and Yunnan, Sluggish Transactions in Eastern Goods</h3>
<p>National cloth, white goods, and fine cloth are slightly firm, while fine twill and coarse cloth are trending towards stability. The morning market price of Dayu fine cloth from Yong'an Factory was 12.65 yuan, and it rose by 0.05 yuan in the afternoon, opening at 12.7 yuan. The Guangdong and local wholesale firms purchased one hundred and several tens of pieces of Dayu and Fugui brands. There were only sporadic transactions in coarse cloth and coarse twill. The Fujian group purchased fifty to sixty pieces of colored cloth, woolen cloth, and serge. New orders from the Sichuan, Yunnan, and Shantou groups have also become scarce. More than one hundred pieces of spring-colored cloth, fine cloth, and fine khaki were transacted, and the appetite for imports has weakened. It is said that due to too much stock in Haiphong and only one ship scheduled within the year, there is a deliberate wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>The spot market for fine cloth and fine twill in Eastern goods is gradually weakening, so yesterday's selling prices of various brands were unremarkable. Transactions with local customers were rare, but the opening prices of futures were gradually rising. This is because the sentiment of the industry is trending higher, and the appetite for imports in March and April is very strong. Although the price is 0.3 yuan higher per piece than the spot price, there is still no sign of hesitation. Dongmian and Ito firms continued to order about one thousand pieces of fine cloth such as Longtou and Laba yesterday. The selling price of Longtou for the far month was 12.1 to 12.15 yuan, and Laba was even sold at 11.85 to 11.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Filaments Surge, Overseas Sales Sluggish</h3>
<p>The overseas silk market has continued to rise. Yesterday, the near-term in New York rose by three points, and the far-term rose by five points. Other Chinese and Japanese raw silk rose sharply by one point across the board. The morning market price of Yokohama spot was 940 yuan, and the afternoon price was 950 yuan. The far-term was 917 yuan, and the afternoon was 910 yuan. In the Lyon silk market, Chinese and Japanese raw silk rose by 1.50 to 2.50 francs each.</p>
<p>In the local silk market, due to the excessive surge, there were fewer transactions. On the foreign firm side, the French firm was quiet, and the American firm was quite interested in purchasing. The asking price of White Factory Grade 7-8 yesterday was 1,520 yuan. The foreign firm may absorb at a market price of 1,500 yuan flat. However, because the user RR has already opened a new offer of 1,500 yuan, the market price of Grade 7-8 must be between 1,520 and 1,540 yuan, considering the foreign firm's expenses. Therefore, overseas sales were temporarily tight yesterday. Filature silk is still popular for domestic sales. Overall, various raw silks seem to be advancing day by day in mid-February, with little possibility of falling.</p>
<p>Yesterday, one hundred and six pieces of Lake silk and forty-one tons of tea were shipped to Europe.</p>
<h3>Grains: Flour Market Brewing, Wheat Shows Stability with Underlying Looseness</h3>
<p>The factory prices in the flour market continued to be unchanged. The customer sales market is still active in the southern group, followed by the northern group. Each factory is selling out the goods yet to be delivered, due to the current flour shortage. Although foreign wheat has arrived, it is still being unloaded, so the factories have no intention of devaluing sales. Only the buyers intend to bargain slightly. As a result, Grade 2 flour still maintained the original price of 4.8 yuan, with 15,000 to 16,000 bags jointly purchased by the North and South groups. There were also more than 8,000 bags in the local retail market. The market is still brewing.</p>
<p>The wheat market has entered a state of apparent stability with underlying looseness. It was found that there are not many sources of goods. The sellers are stubbornly insistent due to high costs, while the factories have nine ships of foreign wheat already ordered. Apart from the recent arrival of two ships, there is one more ship expected to arrive around the 20th of this month, and the remaining five ships are expected to be shipped to Shanghai successively in March. Therefore, the need for domestic wheat is even weaker. Fufeng Factory did not handle a single bag, and Fuxin Factory only responded to 200 bags of Jiangbei wheat, with the price still at 6.6 yuan. Although it has not declined, it is feared that the overall situation will not remain stable for long. The Shanghai wheat market will be almost entirely taken over by foreign wheat.</p>
<h3>Dumi and Kehsien Rice: Hoarders Continue to Purchase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of domestic rice saw only two to three thousand bags of Grade 2 from Hexia and Chelin buns, of which eight hundred bags came from Baimao and one thousand and one hundred bags came from Youpu. The opening of the morning market showed some sluggishness, and then, due to the scarcity of sources, people's confidence strengthened immediately, and the sales market in this street was active again. Hoarders purchased one after another, and sellers took the opportunity to call for higher prices. The situation at that time was quite chaotic, so as a result, although the market was tight overall, there were considerable differences in the prices of thick and thin japonica rice, with increases ranging from 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The supply and demand of Du Yang Jian and Bu Jian were similar. Although the sales channels for substandard rice seemed to be sluggish, the owners mostly insisted on pushing up prices due to the scarcity of goods, resulting in a fixed situation and a hidden increase of 0.1 yuan.</p>
<p>The retail stores and hoarders on this street for Kehsien rice continued to be strong. The total transaction volume throughout the day was still around 2,000 bags, and the market showed tightness again by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan. When the price of Ben Jian soared in the afternoon market, the selling price of Kehsien rice was also called high by more than 0.1 yuan. However, a new batch of goods arrived in Shanghai by train, and many speculators and retail customers took advantage of the high prices to sell off, so the market price was not able to rise again. The asking price for Nanjing Special High Kehsien rice was still being pushed up, with high-quality goods opening at 11 yuan, and high-quality Wuxian rice not opening. The price of bulk goods varied from 10.05 yuan to 9.89 yuan.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Actual Sales of Yellow Soybeans Still Acceptable, Continued Exports of Raw Kernels and Soybeans</h3>
<p>Recently, although there have been few transactions in the miscellaneous grains market, most of them are actual sales. Monthly demand is strong, so the market sentiment is particularly good. Yesterday, it was calculated that the local and Xiamen groups handled more than six hundred bags of Chongming Sand Yellow, and the market price rose again by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan, to 7.75 to 7.6 yuan. Also, 50 bags of Wujiang Picked Silkworms were transacted on this street, with a price of 6.12 yuan, and four bags of Chongming Sand Red, with a price of 6.75 yuan. Although the prices of the above two types have been slightly reduced, they are still in a more superior position compared to the quality of the goods.</p>
<p>Yesterday's soybean exports included 249 tons to Mumbai, 21 tons to Colombo, and 46 tons to Kedah (Singapore).</p>
<p>Also, yesterday 25 tons of raw kernels were shipped to Le Havre (France), and imports included 850 bags of raw kernels and 270 bags of peanuts from Weihaiwei.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Dutch Coarse and Car White, Spot Shortage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the impending closure of foreign sugar and the storage of unsold sugar, the spot supply was extremely short, resulting in an abnormal concentration of power. The association's posted price for 24 Dutch coarse white, goods at the local warehouse rose by another 0.05 yuan to 24.2 yuan. The price for re-exported goods was 16 yuan, and there were no sellers, and later a price of 16.2 yuan was called. Taikoo Car White B goods delivered at the West Warehouse rose by another 0.25 yuan, with a transaction at 23.7 yuan, and later a price of 23.9 yuan was called. The Chaozhou group posted a price of one hundred plus bags of cotton red, with the Jiate brand at 15.3 yuan, the next grade at 14.7 yuan, eighty bags of semi-Southern Blue at 13.4 yuan, and one hundred plus bags of Hainan Red at 12 yuan.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Fruits: Quanzhou Round Longans Continue to Open a Batch</h3>
<p>According to news from the production area of Quanzhou large-bubble dried longans, shipments to Shanghai are difficult to calculate, so the source is scarce. However, as the total closure date approaches, buyers are unwilling to increase prices any further. After discussions between the two sides, the transaction of eight hundred boxes will still be conducted according to the original price. The future market will wait for the spring offer to be opened.</p>
<h3>Metals: Thin Tinplate, Spot Supply to Be Cut Off</h3>
<p>The sales markets for thin tinplate are mainly the cigarette, biscuit, and can factories on this street. Apart from Tianjin, which has some designated orders, other groups have very few transactions. The grades are divided into regular and substandard grades. Regular goods are divided into 175 sheets and 195 sheets. The price of 175 sheets is 120 yuan per box, and the price of 195 sheets is 130 yuan per box. Substandard goods are divided into with and without lining. Goods with lining are sold for 118 yuan per box, while goods without lining are sold for about 110 yuan, which are all 5 to 10 yuan higher than the previous market. However, the current spot supply in the market is very scarce, and buying sentiment is still strong. If there are no goods arriving this week, it is feared that the market may face the worry of being cut off within the year.</p>
<h3>Coal: Hongji White Coal, Another 2,000 Tons Arrive</h3>
<p>During the winter, Fireplace white coal is generally a peak selling season. The population of the isolated island has increased sharply this year, and the demand is even greater, resulting in thriving customer sales and demand exceeding supply. Currently, Boadelta Trading Company has a large batch of Hongji white coal arriving, totaling 2,000 tons, being transported from the Yangjingbang by trucks to the warehouse. Yi Taixing and other managers are selling it. The colleagues are splitting the price, with the unified lump at 45 yuan per ton, the screened lump at 47 yuan, and the broken lump at 49 yuan. Same industry warehouse is sold by themselves, customer delivery, plus 4 yuan of handling. It is said that this batch of goods will not continue to arrive within the year.</p>
<h3>Woolen Cloth: Sales Are Weak, but Prices Remain Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's woolen cloth market sales were weak, and spot wholesale transactions were also rare. There were not many transactions from customer groups, and small customer groups transporting goods to the Wenzhou port still had some orders, while the Western-style clothing group had scattered needs. Therefore, for the goods price, the market was mostly high. This is because the goods at the bottom are extremely scarce, domestic and foreign pricing are reported to rise, and people inside and outside the industry are enthusiastically absorbing and financing them, which has led to this situation.</p>

<h3>The Most Suitable Modern Building Material: Reinforced Concrete</h3>
<p>— Yiqun</p>
<p>Reinforced concrete has been around for less than a century since its invention, and its widespread use has surpassed all other building materials. The meaning of "reinforced concrete" is quite obvious: adding steel bars to concrete is like adding sinews and veins. Concrete is made by mixing cement (commonly known as foreign ash, cement), sand, and gravel, adding water, and allowing it to solidify. However, lime can also be used instead of cement, and cement is divided into natural and artificial, as well as quick-setting and slow-setting. Sand is mostly a natural product, with uniform particles and sharp edges being the best. If necessary, stone chips can also be used instead. Crushed hard igneous rocks are the best choice for gravel. Other good quality limestone and sandstone can also be used. Naturally formed crushed gravel or pebbles are more commonly used. In areas where stone materials are very scarce, crushed bricks can also be used in small pieces, often for secondary projects. Other materials that use cinder instead of stone blocks are mostly used for foundation or paving projects. As for water, only clean water is needed, free of oil, acidity, and organic matter. Ordinary reinforced concrete is composed of cement, sand, and gravel, because the strength is often insufficient if other materials are used, which is not suitable.</p>
<p>Concrete not only uses a wide variety of raw materials, but also has different proportions of cement, sand, and gravel. Cement is generally used as the standard, and the amount of sand and gravel is several times that of cement, all measured by volume. For example, 1:2:4 concrete is composed of one part cement, two parts sand, and four parts gravel, and the rest can be deduced accordingly. The more cement content, the greater the strength. However, the mixing quality of sand and gravel also has a great relationship, and the amount of water added cannot be ignored. Therefore, the strength of concrete cannot be determined solely by its composition, and it can only be obtained by conducting on-site tests.</p>
<p>The steel bars used in reinforced concrete are generally rolled from steel billets of various grades, with medium-grade steel being the best. The surface of the steel bars can be divided into smooth and deformed types, and the cross-section can be square or round, with a total of eleven standard sizes. The finest is 1/4 round steel bar, and the thickest is square steel bar. Small-diameter thin steel bars are commonly used for steel bars and hoops. Deformed steel bars are made by twisting the steel bar around its longitudinal axis or casting bamboo-like protrusions on the surface to enhance the bonding force between the concrete and the steel bar, which is widely effective. When reinforced concrete is used for building floor slabs and paving surfaces, mesh steel plates and steel wire fabrics are also used instead of steel bars, with good results.</p>
<p>Reinforced concrete occupies an important position in construction because it has special advantages, which can be described as follows: Steel bars are materials that can withstand tensile force, while concrete has strong compressive resistance. Therefore, the combined use of the two can give full play to their respective strengths and synthesize extremely strong buildings. Not only is it difficult for brick and stone work to compare, even those that used to be constructed entirely of steel and iron, such as bridges and water towers, can also be built with reinforced concrete. Reinforced concrete is not only strong, but also durable. Once built, it almost does not need to be repaired. It is not as easy to rot as wood, nor does it need to be painted like steel and iron, and it is best used in humid areas and places with sudden climate changes. Wooden piles used in foundation projects are now often replaced with reinforced concrete piles, for this reason. The most important requirement for high-rise buildings is fire resistance. Reinforced concrete can not only build beams, columns, and walls, but also the internal floor slabs and handrails of houses can be made of reinforced concrete, so fire can be absolutely avoided and it is the safest material. Reinforced concrete can be formed into various shapes with formwork, from large structures such as hundred-foot-high dams to small structures such as pipes and ditches a few inches in diameter, almost all of which can be made of reinforced concrete. And it can be formed as a whole, making it completely free of gaps, so it is especially effective for water conservancy projects. The materials used for reinforced concrete, except for a small amount of steel bars, can all be obtained locally, requiring extremely low costs. Even if it needs to be transported to the work site from a slightly further location, it is also because each material is easy to transport, not as heavy as whole blocks of huge stones or large steel parts, so the required transportation costs are lower. Our country is extremely lacking in building materials. If wood and steel are used, they must all be supplied from foreign countries, and the amount of leakage is self-evident. If reinforced concrete is used, only steel bars need to be sourced from other countries. Other materials such as sand and gravel are everywhere, and the quality of domestic cement is not inferior to the standard regulations and can be adopted.</p>
<p>Reinforced concrete projects are not without considerable disadvantages, such as the need for specially made wooden formwork, so the materials and handling of the construction have extra huge expenses. Also, if the arrangement of steel bars and the mixing of materials all rely on proper handling, then the harm will be unimaginable. However, the templates can still be moved to other places after being removed. As for the technology required to handle reinforced concrete projects, it is far less complicated than brick and stonework and steelwork. Ordinary workers can do it with a little training.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that reinforced concrete is the most excellent building material. In any aspect, it is mostly advantageous and has few disadvantages, and the cost is always lower than other materials, which is deeply in line with economic principles. Therefore, its widespread use will only increase.</p>
<p>The general implementation of reinforced concrete projects: the left is a square column, the right is a round column, the upper middle is paving a road, and the lower middle is building an arched culvert.</p>
<h3>The Danger of Low-Voltage Electricity</h3>
<p>— Xiaonan</p>
<p>Be Careful When Bathing</p>
<p>Most workers believe that if a person does not have heart disease, they will not be fatally endangered if they touch 110 volts or 220 volts of high-voltage electricity. However, according to the report published by Mr. H. W. Arlin of the Westinghouse Electric Company in the United States, if the body of the person being electrocuted is wet, then even a low voltage of 12 volts can be fatal. If it exceeds 12 volts, needless to say. So it is extremely dangerous to reach out to turn on the light switch when we are bathing.</p>
<h3>Food Musings</h3>
<p>— Xinqiu</p>
<p>The structure and function of the human body are very similar to a delicate and complex machine. Humans need to take in food, just like a machine needs to add coal. However, the food we ingest either increases heat, compensates for physical constitution, or is stored for future use, which is very complicated. The general characteristics of animals are often determined by heredity, but the food they ingest also has a significant relationship. If a person can usually only grow to a height of five feet and eight inches, no specially made food can ever make them exceed this number. Conversely, if the food is not nutritious enough, this person will not be able to reach a height of five feet and eight inches.</p>
<p>On average, each person consumes about fifty tons of food in their lifetime. And ingesting seventy pounds of food can grow one pound of meat on the body. We absorb about three thousand calories of heat per day. Healthy people convert 30 to 40% of these "thermal energy" into "kinetic energy." Humans use food not only to transform it into energy or store it, but also because of imperfect digestion and absorption, it is discarded from the body. Therefore, on the one hand, we attach importance to the nutritional value of food, but whether digestion and absorption can be fully carried out is also an important matter.</p>
<p>The necessary food raw materials for humans can usually be divided into four categories: protein, fat, carbohydrates, and minerals. Carbohydrates often become starch and sugar, and the main function is to produce energy. In metabolism, it and fat can interact to some extent. In healthy people, roughly 40 to 50% of the energy from the entire diet comes from carbohydrates, and 30 to 35% comes from fat. Fat often forms a protective layer around the nerves. It is the cushion of the nerves. Lack of fat in the human body will not only make it easy to become weak, but also cannot obtain sufficient fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, etc., which has extremely great danger in physiology. Protein is the element that forms the basic protoplasm of cell life. Its molecules are very complex, but only a few chemical elements are included in its composition. Most proteins contain about 51 to 55% carbon, 7% hydrogen, 20 to 23% oxygen, 1.53 to 2% sulfur, and some even contain small amounts of phosphorus or iron. Plants can form amino acids to form life-sustaining proteins, so most of the protein needed by animals is taken from plants. When pure carbohydrates and proteins are oxidized in the body, roughly each gram can generate four calories of heat, and animal or vegetable fats can generate nine calories. Water only makes up most of the weight of food, and it cannot generate any energy. The chemical composition of various human foods can represent a cross-section of various substances on earth. Not only do various elements exist in food, but they must also form a way that is easy for the human body to absorb. If it is said that the body lacks iron, then you can never directly eat iron ore to compensate for this defect, because these elements must wait until after special composition before the body can absorb and utilize them.</p>
<p>It has now been proven that the condition for individual health must have at least 50% of minerals. According to this standard, the average adult must obtain 0.68 grams of calcium per day. Calcium is very important for the preservation of teeth and bones, and phosphorus is also very important. Iron is the essence of blood, and the index of anemia is based on the content of hemoglobin. The human body has about 3% of blood cells that are continuously destroyed. If there is no iron compensation, then the number of blood cells will become abnormal and anemia will occur. It can be seen from this that minerals in food are also a major element in physiology.</p>
<p>Usually, the degree of digestion of food, mixed food is often higher than that of pure food. The purpose of cooking food is to shorten the digestion time and make it easy to absorb. The time to pass through the entire digestive tract is in the range of twelve to forty-seven hours, and excessive or insufficient is an abnormal phenomenon. When cooking vegetables, it is best to pay attention to the amount of water to avoid the loss of minerals and vitamin C.</p>
<p>Life is maintained by food, and health is enhanced by various nutrients. The close relationship between food and the body is really worth paying attention to.</p>
<h3>Killing Insects with Death Rays</h3>
<p>— By 吾昔</p>
<p>Works like a Flashlight</p>
<p>A few years ago, there were rumors that some country had invented a death ray that could wipe out all living beings in the area it shone upon. This was truly absurd and not worth a laugh. Now, the most powerful death rays invented by scientists can only kill small animals.</p>
<p>Leray Corporation of America has recently manufactured a death ray lamp called the infrared lamp, which can kill ticks, fleas, and other cold-blooded small animals that parasitize dogs, cats, and birds. It can also kill pests that harm plant seeds, cloth, wood, and other materials. It is said that the rays emitted by this lamp can also kill bacteria, so it can be used to remove plant pathogens.</p>
<p>Currently, the application of this death ray mainly focuses on removing pests from livestock. The illustration in this article was taken at Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, a sporting goods company in New York City, USA. The company uses this lamp to demonstrate the irradiation of customers' dogs every day, and the results of killing insects are quite good.</p>
<p>Of course, irradiating a dog once will not remove all the pests on its body. However, this is not because the power of the death ray is insufficient to kill them immediately, but because these small animals often leave the dog's body at short intervals; especially when the dog is full and drowsy, they leave the "group" more frequently. Therefore, there are many pests in the dog kennel; if you want to clean the dog kennel, you can use the dog as bait to lure and kill them.</p>
<p>The method of using this death ray lamp is as easy as using a flashlight. Just hold it close to the dog's body and use the other hand to turn the dog's hair over so that the ray hits the dog's skin. However, in order to calm the dog, the lamp must be pre-irradiated several times, each time for a short period, until it is no longer frightened by the lamp. Irradiating each part of the dog's body for a fraction of a second to four or five seconds can kill all the pests in that part.</p>

<h3>Long-Distance Wireless Typewriter</h3>
<p>— (葉人)</p>
<p>This wireless typewriter was originally invented in Germany, and now it has been adopted by both Britain and the United States. It can transmit text to distant places and print it out. Inside the transmitter, there is a rotating cylinder with all the letters on a standard typewriter keyboard. When the sending operator types a letter, the cylinder rotates, converting the symbol into a heavy impulse and transmitting it. On the receiving end, the procedure is exactly the opposite, and the received message is printed letter by letter on a strip of paper. The following picture is a photograph of several strips of printed paper received.</p>

<p>Coal-Made Stockings</p>
<p>Readers have probably seen this argument in the newspapers. Just by having all the women in the United States not wear Japanese silk stockings, we can give "the friendly nation's economy a blow. It can be seen that a mere stocking is also worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>Recently, a certain chemist invented a method to extract a synthetic fiber from extremely common raw materials such as coal, air, and water. In addition to being used for making stockings, it can also be used to make products, brush bristles, and plastics.</p>
<p>This fiber is called "Nylon" and can be drawn into fine and glossy silk. It is as strong as steel and has more elasticity than natural fibers. It is said that this is the first time in human history that an organic woven fiber has been made from minerals.</p>
<p>Currently, this new synthetic material has been used to make bristles for toothbrushes, but its most promising use is in making extremely thin, strong, very elastic, and not easily loose socks. Other possible uses include making sewing thread, woven fabrics, tennis racket strings, fishing lines, as well as transparent wrapping paper and clothing.</p>

<p>The End of the Electric Spark Transmitter</p>
<p>Due to international agreement, all communications from high-power electric spark transmitters will be prohibited from 1940 onwards. Electric spark transmitting stations with a power of 300 watts or more will cease operations from January 1 of that year. The United States has had this firm position since 1927 because such high-power electric spark transmitting stations are sufficient to disrupt international broadcasting. However, despite the opposition of the United States, the telegraphic transmission of low-power transmitters may still be maintained, but only limited to three frequencies, namely 375 kHz for direction finders, 425 kHz for commercial communications, and 500 kHz for distress calls (SOS) in the event of an accident.</p>

<p>Extracting Livestock Feed from the Air</p>
<p>德化舉家 recently gave a presentation at a gathering in貝勞愛斯, describing various novel inventions. Among the most notable were reports on obtaining livestock feed from the air and using noise to assist in the transformation of metals. It is claimed that livestock feed that can greatly increase the amount of butterfat in milk can now be manufactured by extracting nitrides and carbides from the air. Furthermore, certain noises can be used to promote chemical changes in metals, such as a special hard aluminum that could not be manufactured in the past but can now be made. There is also a new substitute for rubber called "Buna" that can maintain its elasticity down to -60 to -70 degrees Celsius, whereas ordinary rubber would already be brittle as glass at this temperature.</p>

<p>Discovery of Three New Vitamins</p>
<p>In medicine, we already know the importance of vitamins to the human body, but how many types there are, we cannot make a definitive statement at this time because the discovery of new vitamins is progressing with each passing day. Recently, three scientists at the 理化硏究所 in Tokyo, Japan, discovered two new vitamins, naming them vitamin L1 and L2. Their report was published in the Japanese magazine "Science." It is claimed that both of these vitamins are essential for mother rats to produce milk to feed their young. Yeast in baking powder is the source of vitamin L2, while vitamin L1 is obtained from beef liver. Another new vitamin, D3, was discovered and extracted by Professor Adolf Windaus and his colleagues at the University of Göttingen in Germany. Its function is to prevent rickets in children, and its effectiveness is greater than vitamin D2. Fish oil contains this substance.</p>

<h3>Introducing "Natural Teaching Materials"</h3>
<p>— 士心</p>
<p>"Natural Teaching Materials" edited by Mr. Chen Heqin. There are ten types in total. Those that have been published include "Daily Water," "Study of Light," "Strange Magnets," "Mother of Machines," "Changes in Weather," "How to Learn Photography," "Road and Bridge Construction," "How to Prevent Infectious Diseases." Those that are already in print include "Air Pressure," "Our Eyes," "Food and Nutrition," "Airplanes," "Who Makes Food," "Our Clothes," "Our Homes," "Ships and Submarines," and "How Fire Starts." All are simple booklets that use simple language to describe scientific facts. High school and junior high school students are easily interested in this. The editor's purpose is to use ordinary, common things, that is, all natural phenomena, to add scientific explanations so that readers can obtain common scientific knowledge. In each booklet, there is an "Introduction" to arouse students' motivation to pursue and explore interest in science, an "Observation Experiment" to allow students to come into contact with common scientific phenomena, and explain the methods, "Reference Materials" to make it easier for readers to find reasons and supplement their lack of knowledge. There is also a "Test Question" to explore the knowledge and experience students have gained. There is also a "Reference Book" to allow students to browse more and have a more thorough understanding of what they have learned. Their knowledge will therefore be enriched. Mr. Heqin has been engaged in education for more than 20 years. He specializes in primary and secondary school education. His knowledge and experience are rich enough to be called a giant in this field. Now that he is the editor of this book, and there are experts in various fields to assist him, its content should be exquisite and its format perfect. It is most suitable for high school and junior high school students. These small booklets, printing and binding, are all refreshing to the eye. Young students who want to obtain ordinary scientific knowledge should not be without a copy in hand.</p>
<h3>New Invention of Handheld Television</h3>
<p>— (British Daily Telegraph, 采)</p>
<p>The art of television is truly one of the most recent and novel inventions, with a complex structure that is not easy to use at first. But now there is the invention of a handheld television. When in use, there is no need for a darkroom. In terms of appearance, the device is similar to a telephone handset, and it weighs less than two pounds. The user holds the machine close to the side of the head, with one end being an earpiece that covers the ear for listening to sound, and the other end being an eyepiece through which a small television screen can be seen. The transmitted image is projected onto it, and the size of the picture is only one inch square. Thus, when we talk to friends over long distances, we can not only hear but also see them.</p>

<h3>Optimism</h3>
<p>— 無邪</p>
<p>I wasn't an optimist before, I was even a pessimist. But since the "August 13th Incident," I have gradually changed, and now I have become a complete optimist.</p>
<p>Some people will definitely say that my life was too difficult before, so I was pessimistic. Now, if I am not a "nouveau riche," maybe I made a fortune from the "national crisis," so I am getting what I want and I am optimistic about everything. This is indeed very reasonable, because there are many people who are complacent there for this reason.</p>
<p>However, the change in my views, although also due to the change in my environment, the two ways of changing are exactly the opposite of what most people think. My life was not very luxurious before, but it was still quite comfortable. Now, although I am not reduced to sleeping on the streets or relying on refugee shelters, I have indeed reached the point of being stretched and short-handed. However, I was pessimistic before, and now I am optimistic.</p>
<p>Before, I always felt that I was drifting around, with nothing to rely on. I would shed tears when I saw flowers, sigh at the moon, and groan without any illness all day long, as long as I had time. I really thought that life was empty, society was chaotic, the country was hopeless, and the world was forever chaotic. I firmly believed that I was wasting my life. I resented life. Now, I am very different. Since being baptized by artillery fire and being impoverished, I have been busy all day long, and I have realized the true meaning of life from my busyness. I believe even more that my life is not in vain. I can do some things, even the most trivial things, that will leave some achievements in human history. Society will always be stable one day, and the country and the world have even more reasons to be optimistic!</p>
<p>In nearly twenty months of the War of Resistance, if one is not insane or has ulterior motives, which descendant of the Yellow Emperor does not have a firm concept of victory in his heart! Therefore, some setbacks and some divisions are just the necessary processes before victory. Recently, "Mr. Party Discipline's" proposal for peace negotiations does not need to be pessimistic, because in this way, the central government can be clarified, and some dross can be eliminated so that it will not destroy the overall situation from within. Therefore, regarding the War of Resistance, as long as we persevere to the end, the final victory is absolutely no problem, so why shouldn't we be optimistic!</p>
<p>As for the world, it is naturally a time when the forces of darkness are rising, hindering the progress of mankind. But this is only temporary, just like the last rays of the setting sun, and there is no need to worry about it. In the five thousand years of human history, we can see many dark periods, but the world today has indeed progressed. This is precisely the spiral progress, although there are places that go backwards, but generally speaking, it is still forward. Darkness is only the prelude and harbinger of light. And on average, although "the general trend of the world, one unification, one chaos," after all, there is more governance than chaos. The difficulties that the world is currently encountering will soon pass. There is really no need to worry about anything!</p>
<p>"Born in adversity, die in ease," this sentence is the best annotation of my personal transformation from pessimism to optimism. "Adversity builds a nation," "A country without external enemies will always perish," this sentence is the best explanation of why the country and the world are worthy of optimism. I am optimistic, let us all be optimistic.</p>
<p>However, we should pay attention that the so-called optimist is not to take pleasure in oneself and stand by and "watch." Rather, it requires us to maintain a happy and encouraging heart, and use a lively and self-strengthening force to strive forward in personal, national, and all things!</p>
<h3>In the Twilight</h3>
<p>— 洪熖</p>
<p>The fields were quiet, and the north wind was blowing gently. The setting sun crawled to the edge of life, its face flushed, glaring at the earth.</p>
<p>A Fu, Xiao Lu, and Lao Liu, three children walked slowly to the town, humming in unison the song newly made by Lao Liu—a young and strong northeastern man:</p>
<p>When we mention the events of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China,</p>
<p>It will make even iron men shed tears;</p>
<p>Our fields are trampled by the enemy,</p>
<p>Thirty million compatriots become cattle and horses!</p>
<p>We are forbidden to speak our own language,</p>
<p>We are driven out of our own homes.</p>
<p>We can no longer hear the sobbing cold tide of the Heilongjiang River,</p>
<p>We can no longer see the shining snow on Changbai Mountain!</p>
<p>But, we don't need to complain,</p>
<p>We will never let the enemy's flag fly for long,</p>
<p>We will repay eye for eye and tooth for tooth!</p>
<p>Compatriots, unite,</p>
<p>Use bloody battles as our answer!</p>
<p>Use bloody battles as our answer, answer!</p>
<p>Humming repeatedly, they were only three li away from Xicun!</p>
<p>"Lao Liu! What do you say, what should we do if we encounter a search? What about those few guns?" A Fu suddenly asked the brave villager softly, stroking the slightly raised thing on his left chest.</p>
<p>"Fool, what are you afraid of! If they don't give us trouble, then that's it, let them live a few more hours! Otherwise, huh! If they're impatient to live, we'll send them back!" Lao Liu answered straightforwardly.</p>
<p>"However, this may be a bit inconvenient for our mission:" Xiao Lu said coldly.</p>
<p>No one else continued to speak, and the air in the four gardens also became quiet.</p>
<p>Suddenly, A Fu grabbed Lao Liu's sleeve, stopped on the road, and gently nudged forward with his mouth: "Hmph! Be careful! Here they come!"</p>
<p>About ten zhang ahead on the road, two figures were holding two Type 38 rifles, walking this way with a carefree and laughing manner.</p>
<p>"Don't mind them, let's keep walking forward carefully! The sun is going down soon!" Lao Liu said nonchalantly.</p>
<p>Closer, the two sides were only a zhang apart!</p>
<p>The two figures were swaggering and squirming as if they were drunk. When they saw the three heroic partners on this side, they hurriedly picked up the Type 38 rifles with bayonets attached, muttering in their mouths:</p>
<p>"Stand still! Stand still! What coming West! Guerrilla team."</p>
<p>"Damn it, Grandpa has to do it himself!" Lao Liu cursed secretly, and immediately winked at Xiao Lu and A Fu.</p>
<p>The two immediately took a step forward, stood in the middle of the road, and raised their hands. Lao Liu also followed suit, but stood a little further behind.</p>
<p>"Hahaha...!" The other side nodded triumphantly, both holding their rifles in one hand and searching Xiao Lu and A Fu's bodies with the other.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Lao Liu snatched the shiny bayonet, and then nimbly stabbed the head of the one searching Xiao Lu with a knife. He fell!</p>
<p>The other one was about to turn around and run, but A Fu had already grabbed him. He wanted to shout, but Xiao Lu had already covered his mouth with one hand! His face turned red, struggling desperately!</p>
<p>Lao Liu made a hole in the top of his head like the previous one, cursing hatefully in his mouth:</p>
<p>"You little bastard, delaying Grandpa's time! Today Grandpa has to kill a few more of you to feel good! Hmph! You're happy!"</p>
<p>The setting sun, with a dazzling red face, was almost at the horizon, but before setting, it still reflected a ray of twilight.</p>
<h3>Each Displaying Their Abilities</h3>

<h3>Profile of Dictators (Part II)</h3>
<p>— Translated by 哲非</p>
<p>Mussolini</p>
<p>Mussolini trained the people of Italy as he willed, and the King of Italy looked like a lackey in front of him, but Mussolini could not (perhaps did not want to) be led by the nose by Donna Rachele, Mussolini's wife.</p>
<p>Mussolini's father used to open a wine shop next to his blacksmith shop, and Donna Rachele used to wipe the glass there. Her habits have not changed to this day. "Donna" is a title of honor that only ladies of the A-level white-collar class can use.</p>
<p>Mussolini moved his wife to the vast Torlonia Villa, located in the suburbs of Rome. But she was not happy, so she chose a simple house at the entrance as her residence. She took care of her "tiger" here, who returned to his lair at night after robbing and plundering outside during the day.</p>
<p>Only one Roman journalist was fortunate enough to have an interview with Donna Rachele. She said that her husband could roam around like a tiger during the day, but he had to return home like a tame cat before half past eight. It is said that Mussolini once said to this interviewer, "If Donna Rachele wants it that way, I will definitely return home like a tame cat."</p>
<p>Mussolini proposed to Rachele at the age of twenty-five with a violin. The Roman newspapers once fully discussed his violin skills. Now all of Italy believes that he is a great violinist. But Donna Rachele has established the law that this "great man" must leave his sword, violin, and speeches in the office.</p>
<p>Donna Rachele did not want to interfere in her husband's politics. But within the family she managed, she would not allow any competitors. After feeding the chicks in the morning, she would take a basket and walk from the small street to the market, and people would not be too surprised at her. The merchants in the market all knew that she was a shrewd shopper.</p>
<p>Donna Rachele never appeared with her husband in public places. She did not find it surprising that her old friends came to see her. She visited them without formally notifying them in advance.</p>
<p>Except in cases of serious matters, Mussolini was always home for dinner at half past eight at night, and spent the evening at home. Even his enemies admit that his wife never did any cronyism for her friends. Everyone knew that she helped the poor "comrades" in need, but she never asked her husband to help them. She secretly helped them with her own resources.</p>
<h3>Hesitation</h3>
<p>— 抱一</p>
<p>A sheep separated from the flock, a rudderless boat, drifting aimlessly in the boundless life, unable to grasp anything real. Sorrow, anger, and hesitation surrounded me, and what I heard and saw were all miserable scenes!</p>
<p>I don't want to live like this anymore. Living like this, I deeply believe that my life will be senselessly ruined. I want to drive away the enemies surrounding me. I want to break through all the dark environments. I want to seek a straight path from the midst of hesitation and reach an ideal and happy place.</p>
<p>But, the ideal's strong enemy, it doesn't let me go at all, it is more ferocious and arrogant towards me, using more cruel means to intensify its oppression on me. The whip of life lashes me ruthlessly, leaving no room and giving me no chance to breathe. The treacherous nature of human relationships everywhere uses vicious methods to control me. My fragile soul cannot withstand such blows and oppression, and I cannot help but feel pain and shed tears!</p>
<p>However, relying solely on tears still cannot escape the realm of hesitation. This is tantamount to surrendering to the dark environment. This is clearly the victory of the environment, and the pain of oneself is not relieved in the slightest. This, apart from showing utter cowardice, has no other positive actions to replace the struggle.</p>
<p>I know that pain is spiral, and in the process of life, it is endless. Those who do not understand the view of life divide pain and happiness into two parts. In fact, pain and happiness are eternally linked together; without pain, one would not know happiness; knowing pain, then one can appreciate happiness.</p>
<p>I want to rouse myself from the abyss of pain: I want to use the greatest determination to overcome the dark environment, not be pessimistic, not hesitate, and wholeheartedly walk towards the ideal happy place. The mistakes of previous life concepts and the loss of the courage to fight must be greatly changed from today onwards. That is to use strong perseverance and decisive determination to replace pessimism and hesitation to stabilize the future prospects.</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>"You are going to the front. This time, it is to strive for the victory of the country, and I don't hope that you can come back. But before you leave, we should all arrange things properly. If the war approaches here, what should our family do?"</p>
<p>Commander Ye frowned and scratched his knuckles loudly again.</p>
<p>"I don't see any railways or highways here, and it's not a military strategic location. Even if the war approaches, it doesn't mean it will reach here. At most, it will be surrounded. That bomb just now was actually because everyone was crowding and clamoring, so it was mistaken for our troops gathering here, and it was thrown down. So, really, there's nothing to worry about. If the situation really becomes critical in the future, then try to hire a boat and go to Taihu Lake to take refuge."</p>
<p>"It would be best to tell Fang Jun not to go back to the army," Mrs. Ye said with a worried and self-righteous tone: "There must be more guns and bombs on the front line, how can people feel at ease!"</p>
<p>"Bah! You really have a woman's perspective. Fang Jun is no longer a member of our family, but a member of the country. How can you let him not go back as you please?" Old Mr. Ye kept shaking his head and said.</p>
<p>"If I am ordered to fight as a guerrilla, then I may come back here again." Commander Ye said with an uncertain tone, and a desire to defend his hometown clearly flashed in his eyes. "But the situation here is very bad, it is really not suitable for officials to use as a guerrilla base. To the east is the Sujia Road, and to the north, 北　平 has also blocked it off. Once these transportation lines are occupied by the enemy, it will be very difficult for the guerrillas to operate and obtain supplies."</p>
<p>Old Mr. Ye listened blankly, and he didn't even notice that the paper coal in his hand was about to burn to his fingertips.</p>
<p>"According to what you said, then this place is really not good, we should evacuate as soon as possible."</p>
<p>"That's right, evacuate as soon as possible." Mrs. Ye agreed very much and echoed.</p>
<p>Commander Ye hesitated.</p>
<p>"Evacuate, this is not something we soldiers should say. And now it is a full-scale war of resistance, and no place in the country can be exempt from the war. It is the same no matter where you evacuate. My opinion is that everyone should not move for the time being. Look at the future situation, either stay here, or retreat with our troops." (7)</p>

<h3>The Pu Shan Villa for Burying Corpses</h3>
<p>— New Dream</p>
<p>After the War, the Lumberyard Moved to Gordon Road and Continues to Work Hard: 60,000 to 70,000 Corpses and Coffins Have Been Buried From August 13th to the Present</p>
<p>Pu Shan Villa is a charitable organization dedicated to burying the dead. It has a long history in Shanghai. Recently, due to a shortage of funds, it held a fundraising theatrical performance at the Golden Theatre. All the participants were famous figures, pavilions, socialites, and the Le Shan She opera troupe.</p>
<p>We know that the main charitable work of Pu Shan Villa before the war was to provide coffins and burial services. With the outbreak of the "August 13th" incident, due to the crowding of refugees and the frequent tragic events, the work of providing coffins and burial services became particularly urgent. During the war, we saw burial vehicles with blue crosses on the streets, which belonged to Pu Shan Villa.</p>
<p>After the war moved away from Shanghai, the population in the concessions was so large that the work of Pu Shan Villa was as busy as during the war, burying corpses every day. It is said that from "August 13th" to the present, Pu Shan Villa has buried 60,000 to 70,000 corpses and coffins. This number is enough to shock you, isn't it?</p>
<p>Poor people who die without being claimed are taken away by Pu Shan Villa, placed in a thin wooden coffin, and buried in the outskirts. Most of these coffins are donated by philanthropists. It is said that a donation of ten yuan can provide a coffin from Pu Shan Villa, and many grandmothers and wives in mansions believe that providing coffins is a great act of charity and often donate. However, after "August 13th," too many refugees and civilians died, resulting in an increase in the expenses required by Pu Shan Villa, which often felt insufficient.</p>
<p>What particularly shocked us was the prevalence of scarlet fever in Shanghai during the spring and winter of last year, which caused unprecedented misfortune for children, and countless numbers died. Poor families wrapped their dead children tightly in cotton quilts or straw mats and left them by the roadside or at the entrances of alleys, and some used small coffins. Pu Shan Villa collected and buried these dead children every day.</p>
<p>At that time, the Pu Shan Villa's blue cross corpse collection trucks patrolled the streets, and small straw bundles and small coffins piled up like a mountain on the truck. The heads and small hands of the dead children were exposed, causing a sense of inexplicable sadness to those who witnessed it. Recently, smallpox has been very prevalent again, and straw bundles and small coffins abandoned on the streets and alleys can be seen everywhere. Although not as many as last year, Pu Shan Villa's corpse collection trucks still collect half a truckload of children's corpses every day.</p>
<p>These corpses are taken to the outskirts of Shanghai for burial, mostly in the Hongqiao area. The concessions have become "isolated islands," and nothing is free. Problems arise when people die at home, and coffins cannot be easily carried out of the concessions. Wealthy families can pay to keep them in funeral homes or coffin storage places, but poor people cannot afford to spend more money for the dead. However, Pu Shan Villa can solve this problem for you, transporting the coffin outside the concessions for burial. Each coffin has a mark at the burial site so that it can be dug up according to the mark if you want to transport it back to your hometown for burial after the war is over.</p>
<p>The lumberyard of Pu Shan Villa was originally in Nanshi, and the office was in Ren Liu Tang on Sixth Road. After the war, the lumberyard moved to the concessions, near Gordon Road and Connaught Road. It is surrounded by fences, and inside is a large open space filled with painted and unpainted wooden coffins. Many carpenters are busy working, nailing the coffins together and painting them, with a blue cross printed in black ink. At the same time, every day, seven or eight burial workers wearing blue cross vests sit on trucks to collect and bury corpses. The trucks leave in the morning and return at night. We should express our sincere respect and offer assistance to these burial workers who work for charitable causes and urban sanitation.</p>
<h3>Year-End and New Year</h3>
<p>— Written by Xue Sheng</p>
<h3>The Eve of the Closing Period</h3>
<p>— New Bright</p>
<p>Customs Are Hard to Change, Year After Year: Shanghai's Financial Market Remains Stable</p>
<p>I really don't know why, once Chinese people get into a certain habit, it's not easy to get rid of it. For example, the abolition of the lunar calendar. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, the government has announced that we should use the Gregorian calendar, but until now, most families, especially those in business and farmers in rural areas, are still using the lunar calendar, and they seem to be even more inseparable from it, refusing to abandon or forget it at all. Therefore, we can very strangely say: "Every Chinese person will celebrate at least two year-ends and two New Years."</p>
<p>Not long ago, we had already celebrated a year-end and a New Year—the Gregorian New Year. The enthusiastic and crazy celebrations at that time are still deeply imprinted in our minds. And in the blink of an eye, another year-end, along with another New Year—the lunar New Year—is about to come before us in the shortest period.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Industry Association has already decided that February 18th of the Gregorian calendar—December 30th of the lunar calendar (New Year's Eve)—will be the closing period for the 27th year of the Republic of China. Also, the four days of the 19th, 20th, 21st, and 22nd—the first, second, third, and fourth days of the lunar New Year—will be the settlement period, and all banks will be closed during this period to handle the closing.</p>
<p>Of course, because Chinese people especially love the lunar calendar, the situation of the past Gregorian New Year will ultimately be inferior to the upcoming lunar New Year. Except for a very small number of modern families, most Shanghai people like to celebrate the lunar New Year. Their busy and tense preparations for the New Year are really shocking to us. Regarding the Gregorian year-end and New Year, people can generally say: "We are old-fashioned; we only celebrate the lunar New Year," to搪塞 (搪塞 tángsè: to evade; to stall; to prevaricate; to make excuses), but for this lunar year-end and New Year, they have no choice but to prepare for it. Even people who struggle to make a living in difficult circumstances all year round plan to make the most of this lunar closing period.</p>
<p>These days, which are precisely the "closing period," people's lives are many times more tense than usual—wealthy families, of course, need not be said, are busy sending New Year's gifts and preparing New Year's goods such as New Year cakes, fruit plates, and lucky envelopes, tailoring new clothes and shoes for the New Year…etc., they are really having a great time. Even ordinary middle and lower-class people are tidying up old things, cleaning rooms, and cooking some New Year's dishes… preparing to have a few days of fun after the closing period.</p>
<p>Among them, the busiest are still those merchants and shops. All industries are handling things according to the decisions of the Money Industry Association, preparing everything in this closing period that has not yet arrived but is about to arrive; they are distributing lists of accounts in this city as soon as possible, and setting deadlines for repayment; they are also separately dispatching commissioners to other cities to collect accounts, and the responsible managers must allocate "头寸 (tóucùn: short-term capital)" in order to safely get through this closing period. There are also "谢年 (xiè nián: thanking the gods for the year's blessings)" and "盤貨 (pánhuò: stocktaking)…" In short, everyone is busy during this period, and there is no free time at all.</p>
<p>According to people in the business field, after the war in Shanghai, due to the increase in population and the destruction of factories in various rural areas, various shops and factories have successively crowded into the concessions, causing the abnormal development of Shanghai. Regarding Shanghai's financial market, it is still as stable as usual, and there is no sign of chaos. Therefore, everyone can expect that no unfortunate events will occur during this year's closing period.</p>

<p>He Liyu was very quick-witted and smiled, saying, "Oh! I know! I know you and Mr. Lin are getting married soon. When exactly is it? Of course, we have to come to the wedding banquet!" Jin Danyu said, "It's next month. That's why I hope you'll come earlier." He Shuangyu said, "Of course! We will definitely come. We won't be going back to Guangdong for the time being. Even our father will be delayed for several months and come to Shanghai. Once you set the date, just send us a message, and we'll come right away. You can't not tell us!" Jin Danyu said, "If I wasn't going to tell you, I wouldn't be saying it now. At that time, I'll have a month's leave, and I'll go out to play with you all." He Liyu chuckled and laughed, saying, "Will you still be going out to play with us then? You'll have someone else to go out to play with." She pointed at Lin Jiancheng and laughed. She then asked, "Where are you getting married? What kind of ceremony will there be?" Danyu said, "There's no ceremony. We'll just register at the Municipal Government Marriage Bureau. But we're thinking of hosting a dinner in the evening, but we haven't decided on a place. There are many friends…" She pointed at Lin Jiancheng and said, "They're all his friends! They want us to have a dance party, but we haven't agreed. It's too wasteful! Although we've both studied abroad, we can't learn from the foreigners. The extravagance and vanity of foreigners are truly the crisis of capitalist countries!" Lin Jiancheng said, "Speaking of the extravagance of foreigners, I remember an incident. It was probably in 1938! China was at war at that time, and I was only fifteen years old. In order to know the current affairs, I was reading the newspaper every day. On that New Year's Eve, a news report from New York said that the average price of a main course that night was thirty US dollars per person. At that time, the exchange rate between China and the United States was one US dollar for six Chinese legal tender. When I calculated it, a main course costing thirty US dollars per person was equivalent to one hundred and eighty Chinese legal tender per person. Just imagine: one hundred and eighty yuan just to eat one main course, which scared my childish heart at the time. Because at that time, there were many refugees in China who had nothing to eat. Many relief organizations were raising funds there, and just one dime a day was enough to live on. Then one hundred and eighty yuan for one main course could feed one thousand eight hundred people for a day. The calculation wasn't wrong. Later, after I went abroad, although I never ate a main course costing thirty US dollars, I think it was just ordinary. Would it stay on my palate forever after eating it? Thinking about our past hardships, we can't bear to be extravagant now." (34)</p>

<h3>Film News from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>— Nie Ge, reporting from Hong Kong</p>
<p>Li Li from Peiping, starring in "A Great Beauty" produced by Lianyi Film Company, has been completed. Li received a reward of (Hong Kong dollars) 2,500 yuan. The film is jointly performed by Shanghai stars Zhang Yi, Yao Ping, Jiang Junchao, Bai Lu, and Hong Kong stars. In addition to the Mandarin copy, a Cantonese copy is also produced. The film is scheduled to be released during the Lunar New Year. The copy released in Hong Kong is in Mandarin, and the Cantonese copy is sold to various ports in Malaya and the Dutch East Indies. It was previously reported that members of the China Art Troupe participated in the film, which is incorrect. Li was staying at the Six Nations Hotel when she came to Hong Kong and has recently moved to the New Asia Hotel in Kowloon, across the sea from Hong Kong. It is rumored that she is going to Shanghai to resume her career as a dancer, but it remains to be verified.</p>
<p>National Defense Films Emerge One After Another</p>
<p>The state-run film production organization, the China Film Studio under the Third Hall of the Military Commission, has been working harder to produce national defense films since it moved from Hankou to Chongqing. Since the beginning of the Anti-Japanese War, the studio has produced six newsreels on the military situation on the front line, entitled "Special Edition of the Anti-Japanese War." The first five episodes have been shown in Hong Kong, and the sixth episode will also be released soon. The feature films with national defense content that have been shown in Hong Kong include "Defend Our Land" (directed by Shi Dongshan, starring Shu Xiuwen and Wei Heling), "Hot-Blooded Loyal Souls" (written and directed by Yuan Congmei, starring Gao Zhanfei, Li Lili, and He Feiguang), and "Eight Hundred Heroes" (written by Yang Hansheng, directed by Ying Yunwei, starring Yuan Muzhi, Chen Boer, Chen Shufan, and Hong Hong). According to Luo Jingyu, the technical section chief of the studio, the new films currently being produced or planned by the studio include "The Last Drop of Blood" (written and directed by Hong Shen, starring Jin Shan, Wang Ying, and Tian Fang, with He Feiguang and Chen Tianguo), "China's Roar" (written and directed by Yuan Muzhi), "China's Childhood" (written by Yang Hansheng, directed by Shi Dongshan), "The Women's Army" (written by Sun Shiyi, directed by Yuan Congmei), "Anti-Japanese March" (written by Tang Yu, jointly directed by Ying Yunwei and others), "Long Live China" (adapted by Wang Wei, directed by Shi Dongshan), and "Creation" (written and directed by Yuan Congmei). In addition, the studio has decided to establish a branch in Hong Kong. The first film is "South China Sea Storms," written and directed by Cai Chusheng, starring Li Lili, Zhang Yi, Jiang Junchao, etc. Li Lili has arrived in Hong Kong from Yuyu via Haiphong, and the start of filming is near. Cai Chusheng specially went to Hong Kong's coastal fishing area to investigate the lives of fishermen to write the script for "South China Sea Storms," because the main description of "South China Sea Storms" is to reveal the struggles and hardships of fishermen's lives, and to infuse it with national defense consciousness, making it a more advanced work than Cai's famous work "Song of the Fishermen."</p>
<p>After Situ Huimin came to Hong Kong, he cooperated with Cai Chusheng to produce "Blood Splattered on Baoshan City," which was highly praised by the media when it was released. Recently, he completed another film, "Guerrilla March," which, as the name suggests, is another national defense film full of national consciousness, starring Zhang Yi and Jin Ling (formerly known as Rong Xiaoyi, a member of the Plum Blossom Dance Troupe), etc. There are two songs in it, co-written by Ren Guang and An E.</p>
<p>Cinematographers Rush to the Front Line</p>
<p>The famous director Sun Yu is now working as a screenwriter and director at the Luqing Central Film Studio. The Central Film Studio is also a state-run film production organization, affiliated to the Film Section of the Central Propaganda Department. The feature films recently produced by the studio include "Chinese Sons and Daughters" (written and directed by Shen Xiling, starring Bai Yang, Yue Dan, Shi Chao, Gu Eryi, and Wei Heling), "The Nation's Mother" (written and directed by Pan Jinong, starring Zhao Dan and Wang Ping), "Ten Thousand Miles of the Long Sky" (written and directed by Sun Yu, starring Gao Zhanfei and Bai Yang), "Wandering Children" (written and directed by Yu Zhongying, starring Mou Ling), and "Bloody Battle in the Isolated City" (written and directed by Xu Suling, starring Bai Sen and Bai Yun). In addition, cinematographers were assigned to the front line to film newsreels about the Anti-Japanese War. Those assigned to Jiangsu and Zhejiang include Ye Jiong and Lian Cheng, to Anhui and Jiangxi include Luo Jinghao and Yu Jianzhong, to Kangzang include Li Xixun, to Xinjiang include Zong Weigeng, to Guangdong and Guangxi include Huang Tianpeng, to Hunan and Hubei include Tong Zhen, and those stationed in Chongqing include Qiu Yiyi, Hong Weilie, Chen Weimo, Wang Yusheng, and Wang Letian. According to Mr. Li Gongge, the representative of the studio in Hong Kong, the newsreels that the Central Film Studio has shown in various places in the past have been very popular with audiences, and the business income is not only sufficient to cover the usual expenses, but also has a surplus, which is enough to show a glimpse of the people's spirit.</p>
<h3>A Record of the Test Screening of "Tears of Flowers"</h3>
<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>"Tears of Flowers" is Mr. Yu Ling's new work. Since the news of the play being handed over to the "Shanghai Drama and Art Society" for rehearsal was revealed, all parties have paid considerable attention to it. Yesterday morning, the play was test-screened for the first time at the Carlton. The setting was a picture of the lives of men and women in a dance hall between May and August 13, 1937.</p>
<p>The Opening Was Delayed by Forty-Five Minutes</p>
<p>In order to entertain the press and relevant parties, this rehearsal was held in the morning at the Carlton. Watching a free show is quite interesting. In the small theater, the seats below were already seven or eight full before ten o'clock. There were reporters, playwrights, and cultural figures inside. Mr. Yu Ling was still in his artistic nature, with dark crystal glasses perched on a head of disheveled hair. The set and makeup time was too rushed, so the opening was delayed by forty-five minutes.</p>
<p>Interesting Things</p>
<p>The first act was set against the background of a dance hall in Shanghai. The audience seemed very familiar with the Lambeth Walk music. Lan Lan's "Dance Girl's Song" was emitted by the loudspeaker in a loud voice, which was quite pleasant to listen to.</p>
<p>In the third act, at the moment Mimi committed suicide, Lan Lan raised a bottle of LaSalle's medicine and poured it into a glass to drink, and suddenly a clear "Beef Juice" sound was heard from the stage, and then everyone laughed. Xia Xia hurried up to stop her from committing suicide. By accident, the glass fell on the stage, and "Beef Juice" splashed open, soaking a large area of my black coat in the front row. The glass was broken, and fortunately the "Beef Juice" was not real LaSalle.</p>
<p>It's Hard for the Actors</p>
<p>There are not many actors in the whole play, but because it is necessary to suit the plot, the male actors are wearing white serge suits, but the female actors are wearing thin cheongsams, which are not warm enough anyway. As a result, the red frozen ears and slightly trembling silver teeth had a slight effect on the vocal cords when singing. Friends sitting next to the radiator could not take off their winter coats. Isn't it hard for the actors?</p>
<p>Three Acts Were Performed Out of Four</p>
<p>As I guessed, the Carlton had to open a movie at 2:30, and the four acts could not be finished anyway, and at the end of the third act, the clock pointed to 1:30. A midget gentleman with glasses walked out from behind the curtain to report the reason for the suspension. In fact, there were also a few friends who couldn't stand the hunger and had already slipped away. Originally, if you want to see a neat or purely hot drama, the experience that the performance will get better and better in the final performance is often as real as it is!</p>

<h3>One of the Lyrics Scolding Wang Jingwei (Xipi Erliu Ban)</h3>
<p>— Edited and Printed by Zuili Pavilion</p>
<p>Before I speak, I can't help but feel angry. I scold Jingwei, the traitor who sells the country. The late Premier treated you with such trust. I originally hoped that you would abide by his will and complete the cause of the revolution early. If all of China were unified, how fortunate it would be. You should have resolutely implemented the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution. Who knew that your desire for wealth and power would grow day by day. Sometimes south, sometimes north, you were used to bragging, flattering, and being completely inconsistent, to the point that even you couldn't explain why. The enemy and I have long established a sea of blood and hatred. But you are confused and unable to distinguish right from wrong, recognizing the thief as your father. What is your motive? A traitor like you is hated by everyone. Even with this mask on, you can't hide your true identity. Stop dreaming and being indecisive. Just roll, roll, roll, roll to a foreign country and be your vagabond!</p>
<h3>Two of the Lyrics Scolding Wang Jingwei (Erhuang Kuai Sanyan Ban)</h3>
<p>Fellow countrymen, it's okay if we don't mention Wang Jingwei, but mentioning this traitor Jingwei makes people hate him. Fellow countrymen, listen carefully. Since ancient times, good men should value integrity. Moreover, he is a learned person. The enemy and I have forged a bond of life and death. If I don't resist the enemy, the enemy will swallow me. The people of the whole country are united, fighting him with all their might. This is the traditional spirit of our people. Who knew that the traitor Jingwei was inherently inferior. The idea of seeking peace shook the world. For the sake of the country, he should have presented his case to the court. Why did he sneak out of the Houzaimen? The traitor didn't learn from Han Wudi, exhausting himself for the country. Instead, he learned from the traitor Qin Hui, surrendering to the Jin people. The traitor usually talks about ancient and modern times, source by source, but it seems that he has never read the Juxian Yiweng. It doesn't matter if he earns a bad reputation in this world. I'm just worried that after his death, when he arrives in the underworld, what face will he have, what words will he use, to face the predecessors? Traitor!</p>
<h3>Chaplin's Debut Sound Film "The Dictator" to Begin Filming Next Month</h3>
<p>— (Reuters, Hollywood, 7th)</p>
<p>Prepared for Release in Early Autumn</p>
<p>The famous film star Charlie Chaplin, who has always been known for producing silent films, will now be the speaking protagonist in his new film "The Dictator." According to Chaplin, "The plot and dialogue have been completed, and filming can begin on March 15th. I hope to have it ready for release in early autumn." Chaplin added, "The plot is naturally related to dictators, but its primary purpose is to make people laugh. The current political situation is particularly suitable for comedic material. Those who possess excessive dignity and power will ultimately be the target of others' ridicule." It is reported that this film is Chaplin's first performance in a sound film, in which he will play two roles, one as a dictator and the other as an inmate in a concentration camp who resembles the dictator in appearance.</p>

<p>— Wang Hongni</p>
<p>Gao Baisui, courtesy name Bosui, is from the old capital. He is the son-in-law of the famous Kun actress En Xiaofeng and the husband of En Weiming. He studied at Fuliancheng in his youth and showed considerable promise. In the ninth year of the Republic of China, he went south and joined Tianchan, privately imitating Zhou Xinfang's style, combining the strengths of both the Jing and Qi schools. His art was a great success. As the only direct disciple of the Qi school, he excelled in both costume dramas and combat scenes, which were exceptionally intense and well-received by southern audiences. (The picture shows Gao as Zhang Xiu in "Battle of Wancheng.")</p>
<h3>A Brief Account of the Zhou Shoutong Amusement Fair at the Carlton One Evening</h3>
<p>— Hai Sheng</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Yihua, the manager of the Carlton Grand Theatre, celebrated his thirtieth birthday the night before last with a grand theatrical amusement fair. Guests entered with tickets and were only required to donate one dime each to the refugee relief effort. When the reporter arrived, the orchestra and balcony were filled. Li Peilin and Zhang Huicong's "Four Plates Mountain" had already been performed, and Hu Tiwei and Jin Suwen had already sung half of "The Peach Blossom Face." Tiwei is, after all, a playwright, and his scholarly disposition suited him perfectly to play Cui Hu, embodying the refined and romantic scholar. Ge Cijiang helped him with this play, so Lao Ge was backstage managing the scene.</p>
<p>Zhang Wenjuan and Jiang Yunxia's "Pinggui Returns to the Empty Kiln" featured the two as veteran partners. There is no need for me to introduce their artistic skill. In my opinion, they should have sung a different kiln scene, as Yunxia boarded the Moufu ship at one o'clock yesterday afternoon to join a troupe in Ningbo. However, it was not Xue Pinggui saying farewell to Wang Baochuan, but Wang Baochuan saying farewell to Xue Pinggui. This pair of old partners was forcibly separated!</p>
<p>Zheng Guoyi, Tang Yunshang, and Chen Tingchao's "Crossing the River for the Banquet" featured Zheng as Liu Bei, Tang as Kongming, and Chen as Lu Su. In addition, the performer Yu Zongying played Zhao Yun, and Zhang Jinmin played Zhou Yu. Tang and Chen were making their debut on stage, and the audience gave them enthusiastic support. Almost every line they sang or spoke, and every gesture they made, was met with thunderous applause. Guoyi's few Tan-style (谭派) lines were also quite moving.</p>
<p>The grand finale was "The Auspicious Union of Hongluan." Hu Tiwei's portrayal of Mo Ji captured the poverty and sourness of the destitute scholar vividly. Wang Xichun's Jin Yunu was truly a petite and charming young lady. Her glamorous appearance could be described as outstanding among female performers. Wu Tianchang's Jin Song was played very comically, wearing a pair of black glasses, which made him resemble Zheng Zibao, the Master of the Plum Blossom Pavilion. He was, after all, an old hand at this and played the part very naturally. When Xichun finished reciting the line, "Why bring a young, hungry, and cold person into the house?", he said, "You are a kind-hearted girl. Next year, I guarantee you will become exceptionally popular and marry a young, handsome, and learned good son-in-law." The foster father was taking advantage of his foster daughter, and Xichun was both happy and embarrassed. The audience could not stop laughing. This evening of merriment continued until after twelve o'clock before everyone dispersed.</p>

<h3>Secret Histories of the Imperial Palace and the Pear Garden of the Former Capital (99)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Two Male and Two Female Leads Engage in Real Fights and Curses Over Theatrical Jealousy</p>
<p>Jealousy is originally a characteristic of women, but in theatrical troupes, there is a strange phenomenon of jealousy over roles. When this jealousy arises, it is exceptionally intense. If not handled well, it can lead to real fights and curses on stage, with everyone fighting to the death. As the saying goes, "When two tigers fight, one must be injured." Therefore, the result is always that one person suffers a great loss and takes a tumble before the matter is resolved. Since the founding of the Republic, I have witnessed three such incidents, each involving a pair of performers in the male, female, and painted-face roles, totaling six famous actors. These six famous actors are He Yueshan, Gai Jiaotian, Shang Xiaoyun, Xun Huisheng, Hao Shouchao, and Hou Xirui. Coincidentally, there were two male leads, two female leads, and two painted-face roles. I will describe each one in detail below, which will also show that the theatrical virtue of the famous actors of recent times is far worse than that of their predecessors.</p>
<p>More than twenty years ago, there was a brave martial actor in Shanghai named He Yueshan. He wielded real knives and spears in his performance of "The Iron Rooster," as if his life depended on it. When it came to his short-play skills, apart from the elderly Li Chunlai, he could be considered unparalleled in Shanghai. Moreover, he had good stage presence, and his singing was acceptable. Sometimes, he even boasted about his versatility and performed the old female role in "Fishing for a Golden Turtle" in drag. This was similar to the late Lü Yueqiao and the living Chang Ruiting, both of whom sang the old female's tune in the Yi character tone with falsetto voices. However, performers should avoid being too self-satisfied and arrogant and should not try to take all the roles for themselves. Cheng Changgeng, the former head of the Sanqing troupe, was certainly capable of performing famous plays outside of the male role, but he always kept that in reserve. Only when someone in the troupe became conceited would he show his skills and perform a demonstration to let the conceited actor see what he was capable of, so that the conceited actor would give up such bad ideas and focus on performing in the troupe. This was a true skill of the troupe leader in managing colleagues. He never used this to show off his uniqueness, because theatrical virtue requires leaving opportunities for others to earn a living. He Yueshan, because he did not understand the advantages and disadvantages of this, angered Gai Laowu, who saw the injustice and knocked Yueshan down on the stage, causing him to spit blood. From then on, he never recovered, and his reputation declined. This was also the retribution for his boasting about his versatility.</p>
