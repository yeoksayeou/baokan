<p>東京　日日新聞載　、外相野村擬於本星期內、與美大使格魯開始正式談判、以期打破美日僵局、茲首先發動、以免美日關係更趨惡劣、此點至重關要云、同時美國人所辦之日本廣知報、在社論中謂、日本報紙對於美大使格魯言論之反響、表示日方似未握住美大使之論據、蓋日報將各要點攔置不談、既不予以接受、亦未發現可改善兩國關係之基礎云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　日日新聞載稱、英國駐日大使克萊琪十月十一日晤日外相野村時、會催促解決英日懸案云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>北平　據哈爾濱傳來消息、蘇日間諾蒙亨休戰談判、刻已成僵局、因蘇方欲乘九月十五日休戰前之勝利、進行强硬交涉、聞已從日方獲有若干讓步、如哈爾濱反共某機關之停閉與哈爾濱若干蘇聯機關之復開是也、蘇聯欲以滿洲里為劃界委員會集識之地點、而日方則主張在哈爾濱開會、此亦為談判停頓之又一原因、據最近外籍軍事家估計、在滿日軍、目前至少有三十五萬人、而從華北撤往之五萬日兵、今尚未調回、（二十三日路透電）</p>

<p>東京　今日日日新聞茶之各報又大登英日談判及天津事件之消息、日日新聞回溯英大使克萊琪曾於十月十一日訪晤野村外相、並謂天津之警務事件、實際上已吿解決、惟中國法幣及存銀問題仍懸而未決、聞英當局已允對於法幣問題採取相當步驟、但英日當局對於存銀問題之意見則尚未能一致、該報又預料天津糾紛將由英大使與野村外相以談話形式加以解決、並不提交正式會議、該報末稱英美如願協助東亞新秩序之建立、則野村外相對於重行開放長江及珠江以供外輪航行之問題將有願加考慮之可能、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　日本時報論美大使格魯所發之言論、謂此言論確反映華盛頓官塲之意見、惟此意見所根據者、係理想匕而非實際上之觀察、故此言論不過證實吾人所抱美國對於東亞時勢今猶茫然之信念、實則日本在華行動之意義、非為較量金錢或攫取讓與權之問題、但為趨向日本前途切實步驟之一、既助以精神上之衝動、且為在東亞設立永遠和平之高尚使命所感動、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>東京　此間甚盼美國來日遊客增加、藉以獲取美人之現金、據此問估計、美人之遊歷歐洲者年達二十萬人、自歐戰爆發後前往歐洲遊歷者、自將轉而趨向柬方、故在來年度中、日本至少可得四十萬美國遊客、換言之、日本至少可得日金一萬五千萬元之收入、故日本之鐵道省現已積極準備宣傳工作、俾能多多吸引美國遊客、（二十三日美聯電）</p>

<h3>上海租界與「歹土」</h3>
<p>上海市廛人烟稠密，車馬喧闐，囂囂然，夜以繼日。惟滬西一隅，地較曠，人較疎·路側綠樹婆娑，略具現代城市之長，在滬稱勝境，故豪富者多卜居於是，即一般市民亦輒藉歲時餘暇，偶往遊憩，自是不同於工商中心之區。不意兩年以來·星移物換，昔有人天堂」之觀者，今則羣稱之為「歹土」。方方數里之內，或則呼盧喝雉，或則吐霧吞雲，色情號召，童稚不禁；因是而破家蕩產，毀名敗節，甚至喪生其間者，不可勝數。綱紀廉恥之為文明支柱，觀乎「歹土」而允足徵焉。</p>
<p>溯自滬西形成「歹土」，租界當局為沿習之權力計，為租界內治安計，頗聞屢與日方折衝之矣；顧乃非特毫無效果，抑且變本加厲，種種法律所不許，道德所不容之現象，彰著遐邇而無所顧忌。夫豈軍事佔領之下，日方竟不足以控制之哉？推原其故：一因日軍在前綫疲於奔命，軍事當局亟所允亟，遂不遑注意於名譽有關之後方。二因各方亡命，以罪惡為利源，遂上下其間，相濟為生。三因烟賭色情，所毀滅皆中國人，視為不足恤。匹因招徠鷹犬，既得就地因糧，復使甘為虎倀者趨之若鶩。五因卸責傀儡，不忠無辭以洗刷狼藉之聲名。六因縱惡亦足以培養傀儡之地位，誘使租界當局不得不俯就之為交涉對手。歹士之為歹土，非以此歟？</p>
<p>抑租界當局非得英美等國為之後盾，亦岌岌若不可終日，兢兢惟圖自保而己。誠使彼此而能姑且相安，行見各人自掃門前雪，未必遽與周旋也；於是演為警權問題，演為房捐問題；此而不足，又進一步而暗襲租界警務人員，更進一步而明殺租界警務人員。捕房報告，報不絕書，至最近三五日愈層見疊出。推彼居心，無非要挾租界當局承認對方之地位耳。何况警區消長，警權得喪。警捐隨之而轉移，固一舉而數「利」者也。</p>
<p>上海租界之本質，越界築路區域之本質，一言難盡，世鮮其偶；及華軍西撤，、於是上海租界又稍變其本來面目而成國際特別區域。此其「特別」之時期與程度，必隨大局而後定。大局如何趨歸，所爭不在此時此地；彼方攘奪，耍惟艷羨一時之利而已。雖然，租界當局職責所在，有未許因循貽誤者：有關租界之法律根據，條款俱在不容假借；非經中國政府同意，不得侵越，此其一也。有關租界之各國，意態未必盡同，故凡百以保持原狀為鐵則；換言之，非各國全體同意，則租界當局無權變更原狀，此其二也。一切不合法不合理之事實，租界當局務須竭盡所能，以至高之知勇，予以糾正；至少限度，亦未可為所謂息事甯人，遷就事實，而對不合理與不合法者，予以確認，此其三也。警權所及之範圍以內，租界當局有不可諉卸之職責；故對於影響治安以及烟賭流毒，務須於租界與歹土之間，畫一絕對不可逾越之鴻溝，儘量堵塞防範，此其四也。</p>
<p>竊為上海計，猶有願為日方正告者：「歹土」之內，自有多數不知自愛之華人，為非作惡，醉生夢死於其間，是屬確鑿之事實；然而成為目前之現象，蒙此歹土之惡謐，則非此一部分華人所配負其責任。惡謐之下，此一部分華人亦無資格分担名譽上之損失。夫若是而有補於日本國家，有裨於日本軍事，則亦己矣，容當別論；事實絕不如此，則何為而放縱之於斯極！上海租界機構之中，日本是構成分子之一；竊為上海計，殷願日本駐滬領事對此作榮譽之努力也。</p>

<h3>戰時歐洲進行曲（續）　倫敦特約通信</h3>
<p>— 叔棣</p>
<p>對於第一問，凡是對於當前國際問題略有研究的人，都可以知道，至少在目前形勢下，那答案，實在是非常明顯的。其明顯的程度，就好像在回答着油與水是不是可以化成一體一樣。至於第二問，我想，用另一個也是資本主義國家對蘇聯常用的形容詞，倒或許可以明白一點的，如實地說明一部份事實，那就是「赤化」。現在的情勢非常明顯；萬一波蘭被德國將主力消滅以後，必然的，牠要去完全倚仗蘇聯；不然，就是軍事上演成兩不相下的局面，未來的接濟，波蘭也非完全倚賴蘇聯不可；再不然，就是波蘭在軍事上根本覆滅以後，未來的具體而微小波蘭、的冉建，也非由蘇聯直接和德國交涉不可。可是在上述的無論那種情形下，蘇聯未來在波蘭某部份或全部份的勢力的擴大，即使在目前，幾乎已成了定論。要是阻止這種現象實現，那末，目前唯一的途徑，就是英法趕快擊敗德國；然而事實上，這大概是不可能的了。所謂「瓜分」也者，是帝國主義世界裏的特有現象，目的是為的取得殖民地，像蘇聯這種社會主義的國家，當然，是沒有這僩必要的。</p>
<p>這裏還有一個最易了解的理由；如果德蘇兩國，眞是「締結同盟」，眞是同意「瓜分」波蘭的話，那末，以目下的力量來計算，不獨英法無可如何，即使把最後的可能的美國援助也算在內，也對抗不了歐洲大陸的這一個國家集團。那末，在對波担保上，英法恐怕早就作了退步的打算；而現在，以目前英法態度强硬上來看，大概在說着「同盟」「瓜分」等詞句的同時，在內心上，連他們自己也不相信的。</p>
<p>在今天，英法的政治當局，和一般遠見人士們，時時刻刻地，放在心上，而在迫切希冀着的，還是：未來形勢發展下去，一個未來十分可能的蘇德正面銜突！</p>
<p>另一個為此地大家所公認，包含在德·蘇·協定裏的默契，毫無疑義的，是德國目願解散所謂「反共集團」。又因為，德。意。西。間，是有着進一步的軍事同盟，在維繫着的；所以總結下來，在國際政治關係上，就等於德國放棄了日本這一個盟友。對於這一點，我們有一個非常積極的證據，足以給以證明，那是：在締結這個協定的磋商過程中，意·西·兩國，是完全收到了通吿；而蒙在鼓裏，一點也不知道的，現在已經證明，祇有一個日本。</p>
<p>然而，一提到這一點，英·法·的宜傳家們，立刻就呌出了「蘇聯打算自由在遠東行動，赤化中國！</p>
<p>中國會被所謂「赤化」麼？這問題的關鍵，當然，是在於中國的自身。對於已經單獨和日本戰了兩年多的中國，這時候，呌出了這樣可以被別人「赤化」的話，是頗為可笑的一件事。然而，我們必須在這裏指出這樣宜傳着人們的用意，那是：離間中·蘇·關係，同時促進日·蘇，間關係的緊張；漸漸地，在中國担心自己被「赤化」，日本担心蘇聯「一掃而下」的司能情勢下，那時，兩面為了挽救自己，都會接受英。法·在遠東的所謂「和平」的調停。這兩天，我們在這裹，已經聽到不止一個觀察家，不祗一次地，在預先放出著道樣的警吿。將來會不會實現呢，現在還不敢說。但對於我們長期抗戰的戰略來講，這裏，是有把牠記下來，當為大家及早提防的必要的。</p>
<p>還有更可笑的，就是這裹傳著的，中國方面對於蘇，德·協定的所謂「反應」。</p>
<p>第一天，明明地，各報上都在異口同聲地說：「中國方面，是在非常的高興着了。」</p>
<p>可是一到第二天，又換了調子。。「中國方面，經過第二度思索後，又在担心憂慮着了。」</p>
<p>到底事實怎樣呢？我不在國內，不得而知。不過，以旅居這裏中國同胞們對於這個協定的看法和感想而論，很明顯，上面的兩樣說法，都是多餘的廢話。如果萬一國內的反應，眞是如此地所傳，一忽兒「高興」，一忽兒又「憂慮」的話，那末，推想起來，倒是上了這些同樣宣傳家們同一宜傳技巧的當！</p>
<p>誠然的，國際的宣傳戰，是先軍事戰鬥一著，而十二分的緊張起來了！英國方面，最近成立了國家「情報部」，指揮着對內對外的統一宣傳。法國呢，這兩天來，最好笑的一件事，是首先封閉了幾家共產黨的機關報。</p>
<p>頂可憐的，是捲在歐洲宜傳戰漩渦裏的一些歐洲小國。今而後，在幾個大國有計劃的宣傳下，不獨視野會一天一天的迷亂；而且，如不拿出各自的判斷力，連事實的眞象，也都不會得到了。（九月二日）</p>
<p>（二）關於「蘇德互不侵犯條約」</p>
<p>這一回蘇。德·間「互不侵犯條約」的簽字，可以說，是歐洲上次大戰後，凡爾賽和的以來，二十年內的第一件大事。牠不獨整個動搖了歐洲局面，同時，也震動了整個世界。如果大戰馬上爆發，那末，牠的深遠意義，是直接地關連了全人類命運的未來。</p>
<p>對於這個協定重大意義的正確估計，將是現代史學家的任務。在此地，我並沒有這個企圖。至於牠的內容，除去德蘇兩國政府所公佈的全文，應當加以接受外；此外的正式和非正式的默契，我在上文已經說過了，今天歐洲的傳說，實在是異常的紛紜。可是，經過道裏多數有識見尊重事實的觀察家們的辯析。研究。和推斷的結果，大家一致認定，此外，也還有幾點，是可以接受，認為是相當可靠的。在上面我也提出過兩點；（一）是關於德，蘇。對波蘭的，（二）是關於德蘇對日本的</p>
<p>在這裏，我想把這些天來，大家鑒定的結果，同樣的，也都認為可靠的幾個附帶默契，再補充地，記述了下來。</p>
<p>（一）蘇聯與德國之問，未來接壤的地域中，波蘭一段，上面曾經說過。現在知道的，是對於波羅的海的三個小國的默契。這三個小國是；愛沙尼亞。拉脫維亞。和芬蘭。這一次，德國方面，表示完全默認蘇聯對於他們今後行動的自由。本來德國國社黨，在這些國家，勢力是很雄厚的。今而後，蘇、德·兩國間，在這裏，至少暫時是除去了麿擦的可能性。至於為大家所關心的立陶宛呢，到底蘇。德。問怎麼商定，現在還不敢判明。</p>
<p>（二）如遇形勢必要，德國力面，默認蘇聯有對於羅馬尼亞東北部比薩拉比亞省（Bessarabia）採取任何行動的完全自山。意思是說，萬一德國擴充勢力東下，一舉而收羅馬尼亞入第三帝國的版圖時，那末，那時候，蘇聯為了保持與德國間的緩衝，會採取任何適當行動，以羅馬尼亞的東北部的一片地帶，重建一個小國，作為彼此間的隔離地帶。</p>
<p>（三）關於保加利亞，德國完全默認，是蘇聯與土耳其兩國的絕對的勢力範圍。德國担保，絕不採取任何領土主權的侵略行動。</p>
<p>（四）最後，是關於那個地跨黑海。地中海。之間的土耳其。這一次的德·蘇。默契是，萬一德國與土耳其發生戰爭時，德。蘇·互不侵犯的條的關係，立刻失去作用。</p>
<p>像這樣廣闊而又週詳的默契，祇要我們一打開地圖，對於蘇聯方面的用意，是一望就可以瞭然的。經過這一默契後，蘇聯的邊疆，北起北冰洋，直到黑海，再東去，一直到裏海，牠的西·南。兩面，完完全全的，已經築起了一道與德·意。侵略在潮間隔絕的牆。今而後，—用蘇聯宜傳機關的說法。—是可以坐觀「資本主義國家間世界再分割的大戰」了。</p>
<p>目前剩下來的唯一問題，是；萬一希特拉不遵守他這一次的默契呢？</p>
<p>答案也祇有一個：那樣情形下，蘇聯會以自己的實力，强迫德國對於默契的履行。</p>
<p>現在情勢已經非常明顯；希特拉當前的目的，千眞萬確的，是在於向英·法·要求平分世界殖民地，而不是什麼進攻蘇聯。所以，在一面，他雖不想大戰，但確巳立下了志願，萬一英·法。發動大戰，德國決定一拚：而同時是，為了達到對英·法。武力外交或戰爭的圓滿，他無論如何，要取得蘇聯的默契。</p>
<p>所以，當里本特洛甫上次飛莫斯科時，他受到希特拉的命令是：不惜任何代價，迅速簽定這個協定。</p>
<p>如果希特拉不履行這一次的默契，引出了對於蘇聯的重大衝突：那個，却是英·法·方面所最希望著的。（九月三日）（未完）</p>

<h3>難童救濟敎養的　癥結和改進辦法（一）</h3>
<p>— 錢用和</p>
<p>（重慶航訊）曾任教部編審現任中央賑委會科長錢用和女士、頃為文論述難童救濟教養的癥結和改進辦法、所提出八點改進方法、頗足為近來各方積極救濟難童工作之參考、茲將原文錄下、</p>
<p>抗戰以來、政府和社會都重視難童為民族的幼苗、建國的勁旅、對於難童救濟教養工作、努力推動、各地保育院·教養院。慈幼院·如雨後蓬勃發生起來、各難童團體如救濟、中華慈幼協會·戰時兒童保育會·中國戰時兒童救濟協會。和漢口市難民兒童教育委員會·或派員至戰區搶救難童、接運至後方教養、或就難民收容所附近設立短期小學、施行義務教育、或在淪陷區內、委託國際慈善團體設法救濟、各教曾團體或學校、亦多自動擔任教養難童工作、政府更不惜巨款、推動難童救濟教餐事業的發展、</p>
<p>二年餘來各難童救濟團　已經收容教　的難童、約有三萬以上、中蘇慈幼協會在西安　功乾州許昌信陽泌陽萬縣等處、先後收容的難童、或送該會慈幼院教養、或送保育會和救濟協會教養保育會在各省市都有分會、並設有保育院、又於鄰近戰區的後方、設立臨時保育　、和運接站、兒童救濟協會會在漢口設有臨時教養院、在湘西川東都設有教養院、漢口市難民兒童教育委員會本在漢口各難民收容所附近、設短期小學、教育難民兒童、復於兒童救濟協會接出二百餘難童、設立西康兒童教養院、</p>
<p>以上各團體、對於救濟難童、互相合作、並由振濟委員會各救濟區、各難民運送配置總站分站、與之聯絡辦理、但是救濟教養的困難問題、紛至沓來、墩結所在、尚待解決、茲分述如下</p>
<p>一·救濟方面</p>
<p>（一）交通工具搶救難童、往往在戰區危急時期、疏散難民、撤退軍隊、運輪貨物、同時都需交通工具、在鐵路綫上、加掛車輛、困難萬分、但掛上一節、尚可容數十人至百餘人、在公路綫上、求得一輛汽車、眞是難於上靑天、有汽車或無汽油、有車有油、司機不熟識路徑、一汽車祇可容二三十兄童、已感擁擠、如遇道路崎嶇、且有覆車危險，水道船隻可以多載兒童、但難民貨物、往往佔去大部地位、難童只能搭帶四五十人至百餘人、有時坐臥烟囱旁邊、恰似爈小鷄一般記得在去年九十月時保育會入川難童、在宜昌等輪、積有一千餘人、雖各公司多方設法運送、每次所戰、最初四五十人、以後百餘人、述運數月、才得運盡、不久武漢淪陷、難童又源源西上、滯留宜昌、迭經函電分馳、各方設法、搶運入川、入川難童、再行分布內地、各縣的交通、路綫更單純工具愈感困難、其他在湘西豫北等地難童的運接、同樣感到交通工具的缺乏、</p>

<h3>金融　津港帮爭先出售　外滙供求之勢懸絕　黃金相近五辨士　美滙已出八元關</h3>
<p>外滙昨日市况、匯豐掛牌、仍無上落、英美匯暗市、趨勢猛鬆、與數月前之在緊、可謂後先輝映、物極必反、非無哲理、存乎其間、本報於上星期六、曾預言八元之美匯與五辦士之英金大關、不堪一擊、孰知未及二日、即見諸事實、雖英金五辦士尚在關內、但美匯顯已衝出八元、而見過八元二五新鬆價、情况速變之速、誠使昔日蔑視法幣而競購外匯者之當頭棒喝、全日過程、初開尚平、且允呈微軟之象、未幾港帮及華商猛塞、立刻硬至英金四辦士七五、美匯七元九三七五、惟匯豐吃胃、殊屬良好、致一度銀行做開、仍與晨開價相仿、嗣因沙遜與津帮以及大刀闊斧之港帮、（聞港帮逐日吐出外匯、乃轉購黃金棉花棉紗等貨物、因上海尚屬物價最低賤之埠也、）再吐愈力、因天津帮之猛拋、致有天津禁止外貨進口之傳設、此時美匯已現八元、英金亦鬆至四辦士七八一二五、迨至午後、更因盛傳華軍種種勝利消息、香港帮暨投機商又來賣出、其時進者缺乏、價乃不支、美匯遂出八元大關、為八元一八七五、英金為四辦士八七五、第以日商乘機購入、鬆勢為之一挫、英金回軟為四辦士八四三七五、美匯亦緊退為八元〇九三七五、豈料此後鬆價冉見、蓋因賣氣充溢、人心不振、英金長至四辦士九〇六二五、美匯八元二五之最近鬆價、惟結果收盤行市、英金四辦士八七五、較上週六猛鬆一七一八七五、美匯為八元一八七五、比上週末劇硬三四三七五、至期貸不乏有人做開、惟趨勢步步鬆硬、與現貸原屬一轍、全天交易陽旺、</p>
<p>藏外滙者當頭棒喝</p>
<p>晨初以倫敦大條及美銀價均無來電、倫敦生金呆定、匯兌英對美·滬·法等各匯俱平、美對英未更、對滬大一角五分、對法小一二五、中央掛脾各滙如舊、銀行晨開現貨價賣、英金四辦士六八七五、美滙七元八一二五、較之上週末、英微緊〇一五六二五、美略軟〇三一二五、開後因港電前來拋出、兼華商等亦跟踪吐售、致市况即見轉硬、計港電華商等吐予外行大通華比現貨英金叫辦士七一八七五及七三四三七五、並現貨美匯七元八七五及九三七五、時英行匯豐亦來吸進港電現貨英金四辦士三四三七五與七五、匯豐掛牌揭曉勿動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉亦無升降、此後賣風稍息、且匯豐吸胃殷健、致情勢一度回軟至銀行買價英金四辦士六八七五、美匯七元八一二五、旋以香港復來電塞、且華行與西商沙遜及天津帮等亦競相拋售、加之某行忽亦反進為出、故市象復趨鬆硬、計港電華行沙遜及天津帮等相繼塞予匯豐等外行現貨英金四辦士七一八七五與七五、並與某行吐予外行現貨美匯七元八七五與九三七五、午刻賣氣仍濃、而外行吃胃較淡、致市勢再硬至英金四辦士七八一二五、美匯八元收盤、比晨開英鬆〇九三七五、美硬一八七五、</p>
<p>種種消息有利空方</p>
<p>後巿因巿上傳華軍又獲勝利之消息、故一般華商賣意更殷、兼港電續來拋售、加之聞外行麥加利亦來塞出、是以趨勢大鬆、美金衝出八元關口、計港電與投機商相繼吐予外行大通某行現貨英金四辦士八一二五與八七五、並現貨美匯八元〇六二五與一八七五、旋以日行正金前來吸進外行有利等現貨英金四辦士八四三七五、及現貨美匯八元一二五及〇九三七五、故過程一度稍形回軟、但不久賣風父起、華銀行與港電等復來吐塞、潛勢重鬆、計賣予匯豐等外行現貨英金四辦士八七五、及九〇六二五、並現貨美匯八元一八七五及二五、延至晚收銀行現貨賣價英金四辦士八七五、美匯八元一八七五、本月份與現貨相同、十一月份英金叫辦士八一二五、美滙八元〇六二五、結果比上週末現期英均猛鬆一七一八七五、美俱暴硬三四三七五、</p>
<p>香港申滙降十八元</p>
<p>香港廿三日電、今日匯市晨開穩定、英美日各匯不動、申匯現貨降五兀、為三百十五元、九時四十五分、申匯現貨續降四元、為三百十一元、十時廿五分回升六元、為三百十七元、十一時三十分重降二元、為三百十五元、十一時三十分續降二元、為三百十三元、午收再降三元、為三百十元、趨勢始終堅穩、下午二時三十分開盤、各匯均無榮辱、後收申匯現貨再降八元、為三百〇二元、全日比降十八元、</p>
<p>天津滙巿同見猛長</p>
<p>天津廿三日電、今日匯市晨開、行情堅硬、英滙現貨猛鬆三七五、為四便士六二五、美匯現貨跳至七元七五、放長五六二五、申匯續降三元半、為一百〇四元半、「聯鈔」暗盤亦賤五元、為九十二元、</p>
<h3>外幣賣氣益盛　各票一再傾跌</h3>
<p>昨日外幣跌勢擴大、緣因匯市經港電一再傾拋、津帮亦續起競售、花旗銀行仍未停售、以致勢頗鬆濫、金市自經財部頒布新條例禁止銀錢業以黃金充抵押品後、跌勢甚暴、是以人心更呈不安、凡此均足以使貯藏外幣者惶惶不可終日、故賣氣益盛、結果以英鎊跌二元三角為最巨、决推英金票及美鎊之各降二元、美金票低六角九分、香港票落七分、法郎票小一分二釐、安南票跌三角、坎拿大票小二角、羅比票及菲列賓票均跌一角、澳金票降一元、日金票趨勢允軟、價跌四分二釐、朝鮮票小二分、餘俱不動、</p>
<h3>重申國有政策　金巿不堪回首　大戶尙未出籠　港帮為大買主</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、首以政府之重申厲行黃金國有政策、而絕對不可作為商品自由賣買、雖上海環境特殊、鞭長莫及、但自認為中華民國國民者、當不以國家法令為玩物也、故初時咸料金價之劇落二三百元、並非意外、而結果僅低一百餘元、更不足為奇矣、晨開因上述原因及滙市報鬆、自應下瀉、故開盤為三千九百十元、港帮頗多購進、被拉高至三千九百四十七元、當日頂價、致急於脫手之散戶、得乘機放出數量不少、午後因外匯續硬、兼利空消息濃厚、為三千八百六十元開盤、惟津帮猛塞、遂見三千八百三十元全日最低價、少頃滙市回軟、港帮繼續扒進、竟三度拉高、及後外滙奇鬆、結果以三千八百五十元收盤全日經過唯一大買主港帮活潑於市、聞扒進三千餘兩之夥、賣方祇津帮　吐出較多、但絕未聞有巨額多頭出籠、故市價未蒙若何影響、當天交易大旺、的四五千雨光景、銀樓飾金步跌十元、海關金仍平、</p>
<p>烚赤跌百餘元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開市塲一片散漫之象、蓋以鑒於報載財部厲行黃金國有之新條例、並再聞外滙硬化、故一般買戶均審慎觀望、但某錢兌業前來撳價賣出、開市較上日塲外疲落三十元光景、若比上週末則猛撳五十六元、首由錢兌　塞予銀樓帮三十兩、為三千九百十元、繼父做小十元、某錢兌業吐予金號二十兩、，價為三千九百元、時香港帮忽委某銀樓及證券帮代為猛吸、市勢立轉上騰、回漲四十二元、某銀摟進同業二十兩、為三千九百四十二元、後賣者稍湧、一度又撳低至三千九百三十五元、嗣以外匯回平、致重激動買風、又漲十五元、證券帮進　兌業二十兩、為三千九百四十七元、此後香港帮雖仍有納胃、但因外滙復趨鬆硬、且某錢兌業代多方乘機出籠、加之銀樓帮與金號亦頻來拋塞、漲風頓挫、不久即降落二十二元、銀樓帮售予某銀號二十兩、為三千九百二十五元、時證券帮亦起賣風、更形不支、又跌十五元、證券帮賣予錢兌業十兩、為三千九百十元、後因某錢兌業忽趁低獲利復進、頓拉高十二元、某錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價為三千九百廿二元、午刻聞外匯鬆勢較厲、加之某錢兌業忽重興賣風、遂步落二十二元、錢兌業互做二十兩、為三千九百元、其時港帮忽再委託某銀樓力吸三百餘兩、但金號與錢兌業供意甚佳、致僅拉高六元、錢兌業進金號五十兩、為三千九百〇六元作午收價、聞收後某錢兌業賣意愈濃、價一度喊過三千八百八十元賣出、但三千八百九十元則有成交，後經某金號塌便宜買進、遂回高至三千九百元關口、午後初開因外匯鬆勢愈烈、買者觀望、竟較午收撳小四十六元、錢兌業售予證券帮三十兩、為三千八百六十元、俄頃現金號賣予錢兌業十兩、為三千八百五十五元、時香港帮突來猛抬、立升二十五元、金號及某銀樓各進金號三十兩、均為三千八百八十元、此後終因外滙報硬、加之證券帮及某掮客代天津帮力塞、且港帮納胃轉淡、未幾即暴落五十元、證券帮售予錢兌業五十兩、價為三千八百三十元、後港帮又來收買、且外匯稍形回軟、不久遂回起五十五元、錢兌業進金號二十兩、價為三千八百八十五元、入後外匯忽又趨鬆、某錢兌業重來拋塞、且買方吃胃頗呆、猛跌五十元、錢兌業互做三十兩、為三千八百三十五元、後有另一錢兌業場便宜買進、遂拉起十五兀、錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、為三千八百五十元、作晚收價、結果比上週六軋跌一百十六元、聞收後證券帮及某銀號共塞予錢兌業銀樓帮共五十兩、價均為三千八百四十元、全天一百十七元上落、現金號之本脾金售出價照烚赤高十元、收進减低三十元之譜、現標金照掛牌金低五十元、均鮮成交、</p>
<p>飾金掛小十元</p>
<p>銀樓首飾金每兩兌出、大同行初時仍懸四百元、迨至十一時十五分掛小五元、下午二時十分又掛低五元、結果共小十元、計大同行改懸三百九十元、新同行與上價相同、進收須减小二十元光景、</p>
<h3>證劵　內債興奮　外股仍堅</h3>
<p>證劵暗堅、昨日巿况變動甚速、上午因消息沉悶向疲、下午因傳聞岳陽克復而漲、檯面情形、因籌碼枯竭、多方始終不願脫手、空方借貨漸感困難、蓋自湘北大勝後、戰事節節勝利、茲更有克復岳陽日軍退淡口之傳言、多方乃更見輿奮、加以外匯逐步放長、金子又逐步趨跌、和平空氣又漸上升、乙種又衝出五十元大關、此次情形、若無特殊變動、丙丁戊衝出五十元大關、當可實現、昨日經過、上午初由同康永康聯和等買進而漲、繼以大通德孚等賣出而跌、儘以多方略有出籠而午收反較週六為低、丙種打破八元關、午後利多、謠言忽盛、同時和平空氣突又濃厚、二十號吃胃　强、茂大益中亦有進量、賣方祇同康聯和稍有出脫、丙種猛抬高六七角、乙種衝出五十元大關、形勢良好、前途比較有希望矣、市價結果續漲三四角、成交總數的計七十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>
<p>股票交易、成交天廚味精廠股五十股八折、同時本所股出價二十八元半、買進無貨，</p>
<p>衆業公所　昨日股市、因交割復祗下午一小時交易、成交减少、潛勢則佳、國際銀公司上海銀公司揚子銀公司等股、頗有做開、茲三者幾已在同一水平綫上、而俱為八元開外價也、其他如怡和紗廠股、瑞鎔股與電話公司股等成交亦不惡、</p>
<p>因外滙轉鬆、橡皮股略軟、但需要仍吿良好、</p>
<h3>紗花　棉銷減色　行情續挫</h3>
<p>本棉成交雖多、行情續挫一二元不等、躉批交易、已比上日為夥、日商上海廠略有採辦、華廠亦有一筆交易、至於同業買賣、驅見冷淡、此由於紗市江河日下、致人心萎靡不振、故生意允為减色、惟靑島方面、對於二三支及四二支原料需要尚不斷乏、所以棉市跌風較為迂緩、不及紗市之烈也、就此情况推論下去、紗廠方面之營業、潤利漸漸减薄矣、蘇北到頭源源而來、碼頭上到三千七百五十九包、今日有棉紗一百件運烟臺、茲將現棉做開情形列左、</p>
<p>另訊、滬埠外棉交易、因昨日滙況之猛鬆、各方謠言盛傳、因之人心異常恍惚、且紗價連跌已有多日、昨日又降十餘元、廠方對於原棉、竟不問訊息、同業亦深恐滙況之再長、俱不願再負巨額交易、故交易殊為靜寂、昨日祗有靑烏帮對於巴西棉仍有進胃、昨日乘廉價又收購千餘件、便俱在一百八十餘元云、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、昨日殊為堅定、晨初因受投機者之購買而激漲、國內廠方需要亦見增多、後更形挺秀、因現貨交易之鼎盛、及空　抵補而漲、收盤價格、較之上日漲六至十磅音、印度棉市、連同價測昨日漲起四羅比、埃及跌十餘磅音、利物浦停市、</p>
<h3>棉紗跌風加厲　再少十餘元</h3>
<p>紗市開盤承上日之餘威續升、但此漲勢、猶如罍花一現、即吿下墮、且跌風在熾、反有變本加厲之勢、此為外匯鬆勢有增無减、部令黃金國有投機家心思看疲、至於客銷受統制匯款影響、仍少發展力量、市塲籌碼日增、市盤乃吿不支、不過環境固然不利、然下跌程度已經深入、多數心理須看六百元云、二十支雙馬收盤以後敲破六百五十元、此種跌度、亦不可不謂銳利也、</p>

<h3>麪粉客銷漸動</h3>

<p>赫德海軍大將親赴滬西視察</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、傳美國務卿赫爾宣佈美國對於本市危局、當加以強硬之于涉後、美亞洲艦隊總司令赫德海軍大將、昨日（廿二日）午後、出現於界外馬路區之西部、若干人乃益信美軍當於不久之將來、接管該區、但赫德大將之視察該區、似屬非正式者、時赫德大將衣便服、偕夫人同行、所乘私用汽車、懸第一號上海防軍照會、四時零數分、車抵愚園路循該路前駛時、可見「特別市府」警察甚眾、而星期四日夜暴徒施暴行、致華印捕死傷各－之地即億定槃路與憑園路交叉處、則有大隊公共租界巡捕．英兵．與「特別市府」警察列行駐守、赫大將汽車繼續循愚園路緩駛、而過注精衛寓所、該屋牆垣用紅磚砌減、便衣放哨者駐守塔形防舍、保護該屋、赫德大將車至愚園路盡頭、折向右行、經滬西火車站旁之英兵哨位、繼循火車路緩駛、至蘇州河折而停駛、赫德大將夫婦在該地陸足而觀已毀之鐵路橋與半沒河中之小舟數艘、寂然顯示此乃前年中日軍作戰之區、赫德大將之車終乃循極司非爾路返公共租界、</p>
<p>昨日形勢較爲寧靜</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、今日（二十三日）全晨上海西區形勢緊張而平靜無事、濛雨斷給不已、公共租界巡補與「特別市府」警察之武裝巡邏隊、巡行於界外馬路區、而集中於白利南路五角傷四週者、爲數特多、極司非爾路一○八一號係咋晨槍擊案</p>
<p>出事地點</p>
<p>駐守該屋之日憲兵、已於昨夜八時他開、一小時後、暴徒復返該屋、聞若輩語鄰居稱、彼等團中另有被日憲兵押往鞠詢之十一人、不久可望釋返、昨（二十二日）晚公共租界巡柿與「市府」警察</p>
<p>相率退出</p>
<p>後、自九時起接管該區之義海軍陸戰隊、已於今晨八時自該砠撤退、是爲今晨該區之唯一變動、租界巡捕與「市府」警察、於晨間維待嚴格之戒備、對行人輾施搜查、</p>
<p>領團方面將有行動</p>
<p>自滬西新事件發生後、西報記者、曾再謁工部局總辦費利溥、叩詢其意見、費氏稱、渠所欲嘗者、皆包括於二日前所交表之聲明中、除此以外、別無其他意見、專實顯然、工部局態度毫不變更、前日爲星期日、各機關停止辦公、至昨晨、幕後外交活動、遂頗爲忙碌、據聞領團對越界築路問以、所引起之一切斜紛、即將採取行動、但事機尙未成熟、一時尙不允宜布耳、</p>
<p>僞市政府應負責任</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、工部局總裁費利溥、昨（二十二日）午後聲稱、關於界外馬路之管理與昆連此等馬路的區域之爭執、未能獲得合理之調整者、應由上海「特別市府市長」傳筱庵負其責任、工部局已向傳氏及其官員表示局方準備並願意對目前之僵局、討論任何合理之調整、但局方未接「市府」方面之合理的提議、目前整個事件、已在領事圖之手、局方已</p>
<p>向領事團</p>
<p>提出交涉、俾使警務處不能控制而由「特別市府」直接管理的區域中之可嘆局面、得告終止云、據工部局發言人稱、工部局雖準備與任何負責官憲談判、俾解決現有之爭端、但不擬將警務權等一切讓予任何政權、有組織之流氓與暴黨、能自昆運租界馬路之區</p>
<p>出發活動</p>
<p>挾槍在租界馬路上滋擾、然後退入「市府」管理下之區域、此非工部局及其警務處所能加以阻止、惟「市府」當局自應能加控制、因「市府」方面曾宜稱正式管轄昆運租界馬路之區域也、群跡非租界所轄而由「市府」管理區中之暴徒、兩度在界外馬路行兇殺人、足證「市府」對此等區域、</p>
<p>全無控制</p>
<p>目下調整工部局與「市府」間事件之問題、已在領事團之手、工部局對於界外馬路、切欲獲得諒解、但非以完全「讓棄」爲基礎、工部局發言人又稱、整個事件、已提交領事團、但迄今無成就、同時、西區之毫無法紀、已至極點、警務處人員昨　襲擊、乃上海「市府」在其轄區內、不能有效的加以治理之又一徵象、工部局已提議以合乎情理之態度、從事談判、但决不屈服於威脅與讓棄局方之權利、</p>

<p>曹家渡段意軍戒嚴</p>
<p>曹家渡方面、本爲意軍防區、迨前晨發生僞自衛團襲擊巡捕新事件後、義軍即有兩隊出防、協同租界巡捕維持治安、大中社記者前晚曾得一謠傳、謂越外　　　　已撤退、英軍業已同意　　　區　防於意軍、而由其　警、當時會以電話詢之靜安寺路捕房負責者、據表示、僅爲曹家渡一段、但記者以該地本爲意軍防區、意軍隨時均可出防、似不適用「接管」之說、迨昨晨如明　、係是晚意軍施行「戒嚴」之誤、聞當晚（二十二日）意軍以謠言紛起、爲防止再有同樣事端發生、及維護地方治安計、入晚即提早戒嚴、於下午九時起、禁止任何車輛行人經過曹家渡、故極司非而路五角塲、白利南路星加坡路康腦脫路等一帶、入晚均斷絕交通、直至昨晨六時、始恢復原狀</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>談日記</h3>
<p>— 丁山</p>
<p>我有規律地寫日記，還是今年開始的。常聽說某偉人天天萬忙中亦不忘寫日記，我雖沒有做偉人的野心，雖亦不大相信這種烘雲托月的說法，但我想天天寫日記，也是訓練恒心的方法，所以就幹了。</p>
<p>看過去的日記，倒也是消閑妙法，體騐和迴想自己生活和心情變化的過程。那多够味！自己責問，自己辯駁，自己勝利，亦是自己失敗，所謂良心和現實的戰鬥，在事過境遷時，它給我們留着了。</p>
<p>似乎是郁達夫說過，日記該在文學中佔最高的地位，因為日記能表現眞實的情感，眞實的情感之可貴，不消說得。老實不客氣，現在我們看到的文字，就拿「憶」，「悼」，……之類的抒情文來說，能有幾篇可擔保其眞實的？至於日記，因為非公開，不必忌諱，母需揑造，然而第二個人竟然看到了，豈非可以「震憾心靈」麼？</p>
<p>但是不幸得很，日記如果有些給旁人看到的可能，它的眞實性又得大打折扣。至於存心發表，或預備百年之後石印問世的先生們的日記，更不必說了。</p>
<p>還有一情形，像我因為四週耳目衆多，下筆有顧忌，不寫心里不愜意，於是過後翻閱「手跡」，有時不是有幾個字連自己也不認識，便是有幾句自己也解釋不通，這種日記，更無所謂眞實和不眞實了。</p>
<p>日記尚且如此，比日記矮一等的書簡，說話，小說，等等更其不堪設想了。雖然他們還有各個的價値。</p>
<p>蘇羅門說：「聰明人的言語是蘊藏在心中的，只有愚笨的傢伙才把心放在外面給人看。」蘇羅門眞最聰明不過，他也曉得日記總算是「外面」，除非也能像心一樣放在胸內，就不能有完全眞實的情感。</p>
<p>世界上，因此有很多是聰明人，但無疑地笨人也未嘗沒有，他毋要是動動筆的話，雖然並非寫日記，這些文章還是使人家不開心，這樣，他們就會轉過頭來怪笨人，因此笨人苦矣。</p>
<p>我亦是聰明人！不做聰明人，那還成麼？南美州心露在外的女孩不是運三天都活不成麼？</p>
<h3>韓江夜渡</h3>
<p>— 徐野</p>
<p>嶺東追記</p>
<p>浩浩的韓江正向東流，黃昏的落日緊吻着遠處的山巒，江的四周更顯得荒凉和凄靜。</p>
<p>我們這一羣剛從城裏來的，有男，有女，十多個人結成一隊，掮在我們背上是包袱，水壺，和幾件零什的慰勞品……</p>
<p>沙原上展開着渺漠的冷寂，沒有村會，沒有燈火，深秋的西風有時吹下來一朶落葉，沙的一聲……</p>
<p>「甚麼？看看——」</p>
<p>「哦！落葉呀！一朶，兩朶，」</p>
<p>大家蕴藏了無限的興奮，每個人手裏把玩着秋葉，雖然它的生命如今枯萎了，可是，它的新生却寄託在未來，在眼前，在冬天過後的春日。</p>
<p>沿着長提，朝前推行，江水波動着，讓水聲配合起我毋的步伐。時時有夜風撲過臉龐，帶來細微的塵灰……</p>
<p>夜果然來了，一切很迷濛，走在最前的行列後面是瞧不淸了。</p>
<p>「喲！韓江怎麼這樣長呢？」同伴的聲響，從背後傳過來。</p>
<p>「是呵！你再看，韓江就是葬送狄人的墳塲啊。」</p>
<p>音浪激燙在夜空，在廣大的江面。</p>
<p>天，一望盡是黑黝黝地，夜幕壓着郊野，周圍的山巒看去只有一團黑影。在行進中瞥見溜過的流星，旋動的一綫光會給我毋瞭解了面前的方向。</p>
<p>現在，我們到了韓江古老的渡頭。</p>
<p>「船呢？」</p>
<p>「那對過的不會來嗎？你注意一回水面的倒影……」</p>
<p>黑暗的濃霧下甚麼都是黑色的，韓江之水也映着黑色。船開過來，遠遠的渡頭可不能捉摸啊。站在亭裏，寒風掠襲着。船在甚麼時候來？誰都不知道。</p>
<p>又有一顆流星飛向西面降落了，大家再睜起高興的眼。</p>
<p>等着，等着，忽然「個同伴驚奇地大聲喊：</p>
<p>「渡船來了，來了呀！……」</p>
<p>「大家渡江去！」</p>
<p>夜霧裹，隱的地可以看出江面的船影，飄飄浮浮地發出嘩啦嘩啦來，岸畔的蘆葦似乎在顫抖着，櫓聲靠近江邊了。</p>
<p>「誰呢？從那兒來？」，</p>
<p>江上老年人問着。</p>
<p>「我們城裏來，趕夜路的。」</p>
<p>船艙中發着豆粒的燈光，依稀知道這個管渡的老年人在打量這羣年輕的夜行者，——陌生的，男女的，從城裏趕到的人……</p>
<p>「到陳家祠的團部去，不遠吧？」</p>
<p>「耍是夜裏能順風，明早就可以到了。」</p>
<p>他笑着，看着我們說話時常常點頭。</p>
<p>船向上流移動，慢慢地。</p>
<p>「韓江！我們的血，奔流不停的江水呵……」</p>
<p>茫茫的夜天，流星也再不能見了，江兩邊一望無際的蘆華，疏疏密密地搖擺着，長空偶來幾聲雁唳，櫓聲更撥起浪花，遠遠的犬吠又斷續地透進耳膜。當迷糊的村鼓曳過林梢我們再度驚異的互相探問着：</p>
<p>「幾下嗎？二更還是三更？」</p>
<p>划櫓的老年人擦着洋火抽了一口黃烟。。「不遠吧！聽四更快打了。」</p>
<p>潮濕的風，吹動着船上的燈，搖晃的半點微光中我們看消了自己。守舵的主人悠然握住烟管，他更舒適地哼着一支航行的歌。</p>
<p>鷄啼着。</p>
<p>韓江浪潮澎湃着，黎明就不遠的來了啊。</p>
<h3>經驗之作</h3>
<p>— 夏仁麟</p>
<p>「現代新聞學概論」</p>
<p>中國的新聞事業，說起來已經是相當的發達了，新聞學的研究，亦已引起了靑年們濃厚的興趣；可是新聞學的著作方面，依然貧乏得可憐。有志研究的人，耍想找一兩本適合時代的專門著作，實在為難。</p>
<p>最近世界書局出版了一本儲玉坤氏新著「現代新聞學概論」，內容以歐美新聞學的理論為主，輔以作者個人在報界服務多年所得的經騐，二百頁的篇幅，却包含了非常豐富的材料。有此一册，大可彌補新聞學出版方面的缺憾了吧。作者雖在自序中自稱為初次嘗試，可是却可許為理論與實踐並重的權威著作。</p>
<p>本書內容，共分十三章，（一）緒論；（二）現代報業的趨向；（三）現代報館的組織；（四）社諭；（五）編輯；（六）新聞採訪；（七）輿論與宣傳；（八）戰時新聞；（九）印刷；（十）報業管理；（十）（一）廣吿；（十）（二）報紙的發行；（十）（三）新聞法令。</p>
<p>這一本書之所以值得推廣，就是它一方面概要地論述新聞學中各部門的問題，從原理，歷史到編輯，採訪，管理，廣吿，發行，印刷等實際問題。而同時每一章每一節都有其精到之處，遠非一般的入鬥之類的著作可比。</p>
<p>這裏有三章須特為提出介紹的，一是「現代報業的趨向」，作者一方面詳細地寫着廿世紀報紙驚人的發展：大量生產，消息靈通，形式美觀，內容充實。同時又指出了隨着報業發展而潛生的種種危機，如言論不能自由，黃色新聞之流傳，廣吿商人之操縱等問題，都是衆所忽視的。第二第三是輿論與宣傳及戰時新聞一章，作者在暢論輿論的意義，宣傳的目標以後，進而詳述戰時新聞政策，戰時新聞採訪和戰時國際宣傳。這幾個問題，在抗戰現階段的中國，是多麼迫切而合乎現實啊！</p>
<p>不過，嚴格的說，本書對採訪方面，似乎還欠完善，因為採訪的工作是最複雜最難應付的，需要幾許智慧與技巧，始能勝任愉快，所以短短一章，實在不夠透澈。可是這一點並不足為本書病，對於有志投身新聞界的靑年，這一本書還是最適宜的讀物。</p>
<h3>雨夜</h3>
<p>— 錢鴻縉</p>
<p>午夜醒來，雨滴正淅瀝地緊打玻窗，沉重地一聲一聲，像木槌輕叩心房。</p>
<p>雨落在水窪，也可聽見澌水之音，接着又是第二次的浙瀝。當落在蓋着洋鉛皮的露天棚，却又淸脆得有若珠落玉盤，滴滴可數。</p>
<p>隨着雨聲，我斷續地想起老宅園裏的棗樹，家鄉的草堂，蒼鬱迂廻的山嶺，瘦西湖似的慈湖。</p>
<p>我就沉醉在記億的網　。雨聲也如諧和的伴奏，使我更沉醉了。但隨着雨聲，我也斷續地想起蹬在積水齊腰的坑壕中的戰士，流離顛沛的受難者，世紀末瘋在的享樂，難產中的新中國。雨聲也如憤怒的訴說，慷慨的悲泣……我啊，緊握着自己底頭髪。</p>
<p>室內屋外，全是黑黝黝一片，像封建時代的土耳其婦女蒙着黑厚的面幕。「光明在何處啊？」我問。但也知道雨儘能掃蕩長夜的黑暗，洗淸恥辱的紀錄。一夜陣雨，明朝不又旭日高照，全宇宙浴着光明的聖水？</p>
<p>窗外，雨更大了，像決了隄似的一股洪流，儘從天幕的　隙中怒瀉急淌，劇烈地敲着屋瓦；我想像屋瓦必將捲起陣長久的積塵了。雨！像冬夜的在飚掠過偌大的森林，像千萬戰馬奔騰向前進發。</p>
<p>漸漸，也有風在試着初聲</p>
<p>暴風雨後，將是怎樣的一個日子？</p>
<h3>建議</h3>
<p>— 沈濤</p>
<p>大地泛濫了！</p>
<p>緩行的汽車，</p>
<p>濺起泥水……</p>
<p>不相識的同路人啊！</p>
<p>我遇見了你，</p>
<p>——在東潭之旁；</p>
<p>你碰到了我，</p>
<p>——在西溝之邊。</p>
<p>雖然你先問我；</p>
<p>「歸路在那裹？」</p>
<p>我却耍問你：</p>
<p>「歸路泯沒否？」</p>
<p>茫茫的澤之市，</p>
<p>想今夜總難退盡。</p>
<p>互投悽凉的苦笑，</p>
<p>默立十字街頭者啊，</p>
<p>母寗挾破靴，携手同行，</p>
<p>涉水問前途！</p>
<p>吾則大雨重臨，</p>
<p>狂瀾莫挽。</p>
<p>不相識的同路人啊！</p>
<p>對我這一個建議，</p>
<p>未知尊意如何？</p>
<h3>論「言之有物」的「物」</h3>
<p>— 卞洛</p>
<p>「言之有物」不單是短小作品的要求，也是長篇巨著的要求；若僅是「今天天氣哈哈哈」之類，不管是長是短，應擲入毛厠，毫不可惜。</p>
<p>世界上並不缺少一些可言之物，允其在這大時代，若怕說來說去，終成八股，而八股事實上證明，即不在窮鄉僻壤也還需耍：不需要的是那批扯誕的，他們正要扯「誕」到「沒有」的程度呢。於是還是「今天天氣哈哈哈」。</p>
<p>丟開「八股」或描寫生產建設或社會形態之類不談，而此時此地「物」還多着，滴一滴污水，顯微鏡下便看到幾許小生物的蠕動，這裏面有沒有傷寒病菌呢，或會不會使人霍亂吐瀉也很可一談吧。</p>
<p>人是唯恐世界太冷靜的。想像於妖魔現形，狐狸露尾，那是做夢。但還有道行不深，搔一下癢處搖搖，觸一下痛創，便回過頭來。</p>
<p>但，這並不能證明紙彈不如實彈。不然，世界上祇剩下啾啾之聲了。</p>
<p>擾一下汚水，會浮起幾許沉澱，揚起一陣腥臭，常使潔身者却步，而這類東西更搖擺得起勁。</p>
<p>對此：我們是需要更潑刺點，要可能技巧地去勾出些嘴臉，短小作品很好的題村，也許就在此吧。</p>

<h3>游藝界與難胞寒衣運動</h3>
<p>— 宴然</p>
<p>最近為了氣候的日趨寒冷，於是各界對於難胞的寒衣問題，都在開始注意起來。有許多熱心的人士毋，已在積極的進行難胞寒衣的募集，使三萬餘流浪孤島的無吿難胞，能夠挨過這個寒冷的冬天，這種工作，眞是值得敬仰，值得欽佩。</p>
<p>游藝界是時代的先驅，它的一舉一動，在在能够給予觀衆們一種深刻的印象，為了這，我們深切的希望游藝界當局，以及一般的從事員，大家對於難胞們寒衣的徵集，要給予偉大的助力，使這個嚴重的難胞寒衣問題，得到圓滿解決。</p>
<p>游藝員對於難胞寒衣運動的推進，第一應該儘可能的盡着自己的力量，勸導家屬親友們參加，此外，在業務上更要儘量的利用機會，穿揷那難胞們流離顛沛的苦况，以及無衣禦寒的悲哀。用眞誠的口吻，動人的表情，來激盪每個觀衆的心靈，使他們自動的來參加這個偉大的難胞寒衣運動。能够這樣，才算盡了游藝員的責任，才是游藝界對於救濟難胞的偉大貢獻。</p>
<h3>歐戰後的法國影業</h3>
<p>— 華志</p>
<p>這次歐戰爆發前後，法國的娛樂事業雖受相當影響，而影片業却反而蓬勃起來。巴黎市上現在平添許多製片家，導演，演員。其中有自德英意比蘇聯各國來的，也有從好萊塢直接歸國的，男星如却爾斯飽耶，女星如黛蔞克絲等，他們一方面共赴國難，一方面也就為祖國影業效勞。</p>
<p>巴黎的製片商，份子複雜，依他們的財力而論，每人每年平均可製兩部。財力雄厚的，是所謂「影業聯盟」（Cine-Alliance）由俄人辣賽維區主持，每年可產六片，巴黎馳譽世界的四大名旦西蒙西蒙等等，即為所羅致。目下他們正拍悲壯慷慨之片，如「北國的鐵流」「抗戰勇士」「義勇艦」「碧天萬里」「暴風雨下的巴黎」。</p>

<p>民華公司係由有志於電影事業之童振民金信民二君所合辦，兩人均為極有魄力之靑年。在「漁光曲」公演時，報端會發現不明來歷之義務大幅廣吿，即係金君所送登，且連觀該片達一二十次之多，其醉心電影事業可見一般。</p>
<p>張翼費穆與金童原為舊友，合作拍片之意，醞釀已久，直至最近方始組成民華公司，決定拍「孔夫子」。劇本大致就緒，細部尚在詳細研討中，因孔子事蹟之處理，實較其他歷史人物困難也。</p>
<p>「孔夫子」雖係由張翼主演，但張並非飾孔子，乃飾好勇之子路。至於孔子一角之演員人選，尚在斟選中。其他演員最近當可發表。攝影工作已聘就名攝影師周達明担任，將在改名華聯之聯華總廠攝製。</p>
<p>因交通不便而留滬之廣西大學教授費康氏亦參加工作，費氏不但對國學極有研究，且為建築專家，關於置景道具服裝方面之考據及設計亦將有特別貢獻。</p>
<p>「孔子」事蹟，達在二千四百年前，逈不同演義性質之題材，較為適宜於編製電影，故費穆氏已收集大批參考書籍，並與國學家多人從事研討劇本，預計攝製工作將於下月開始</p>

<p>喜歡料理家務</p>
<p>秀蘭對於料理家務，非常感到興趣，這是她新近體騐到的唯物主義，擺桌子，掛窗布，母親在廚房裏燒菜，她常要去問關於燒菜的方法，有時還自己動動鏟刀呢。</p>
<p>一種新的改變</p>

<p>實行節食减肥</p>
<p>她的身體，近來一天比一天胖了，大家都擔心她會胖得不再適宜上銀幕，所以最近經過醫生的檢查，實行節食减肥法，這對於秀蘭是一件非常痛苦的事情。因為這樣一來，她再也不能暢吃甜食了，有人禁止她多吃糖，除了星期日或例假外，她不能再吃巧克力糖。</p>

<h3>Hua Army Intensifies Encirclement of Yueyang City; Japanese Troops Completely Defeated at Qinggangyi, Due North of Xinqiang Town; Japanese Communication Line Between Jing'an and Fengxin Severed</h3>
<p>Chongqing: According to news from here today, after the Chinese army recaptured Matang, 17 miles south of Yuezhou, last night, Yuezhou has become the only strong fortress for the Japanese army on the northeast bank of Dongting Lake. The Chinese army that captured Matang has now made contact with the Chinese army surrounding Yuezhou, intensifying the encirclement of Yuezhou. Another unit of the Chinese army, taking advantage of the heavy rain yesterday, captured several Japanese strongholds including Xialongwan (transliteration), northeast of Xinqiang. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>Guilin: Chinese troops on the north bank of Xinqiang have been continuously attacking the Japanese army for days. Another unit besieged Qinggangyi, where 400 Japanese troops stubbornly resisted. They were finally defeated by the Chinese army at night. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Shashi: The Japanese troops who fled from Bailuoji to the vicinity of Yanzikou were surrounded and attacked by the Chinese army. By the 20th, their casualties reached over 800. On the 21st, they broke through the encirclement and fled towards Bailuoji Yanglin. They were intercepted and attacked by the Chinese army along the way, suffering heavy losses. Currently, the Chinese army has advanced to the vicinity of Bailuoji. A remnant of the Japanese army has fled into warships, and the Chinese army is attacking them. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Miluo: Since the Chinese army, having recovered Shangxialongwan Bridge and Changshan, launched an attack on Xinkaitang and Qinggangyi, due north of Xinqiang Town, on the 22nd, there has been considerable progress. Fearing that these two places would be captured, which would be even more unfavorable, the Japanese not only reinforced each of the two places and launched a counterattack against the Chinese army but also sent a unit from Taolin Xitang around to the vicinity of Caoxieling, east of Shangxialongwan Bridge, to attack the Chinese flanks. Therefore, the battle there was still raging fiercely as of the evening of the 23rd. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Xiushui: The Chinese army in northern Jiangxi has recovered important towns such as Maxingshan and Baimaogang, south of Fengxin. The Japanese army's connection between Fengxin and Jing'an has also been cut off by the Chinese army. After the Chinese army in Wuning recovered Futianqiao, its vanguard is now approaching Wuning. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Guilin: From 7:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd, Japanese artillery near Xiangujian, below Wuning, continuously shelled the area of Futianqiao Sigu Terrace, and there were many poisonous gas shells. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Now that winter is approaching, the water levels of the Yangtze River, Xiang River, and Dongting Lake are gradually decreasing. Therefore, it is almost impossible for the Japanese to launch another large-scale offensive in central China, because whether attacking Yichang or Changsha, the Japanese army will not be able to rely on the support of its warships. The Japanese have always relied on warships to support their land operations with heavy naval artillery bombardment and to transport troops and supplies. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Chinese Army in Southern Henan Charges into Lucheng City, Fierce Street Fighting Erupts, Japanese Army Suffers Heavy Casualties</h3>
<p>Xuchang: On the evening of the 15th, the Chinese army attacked Lucheng, clearing all the remaining Japanese troops in the suburbs. They immediately launched a fierce attack on the city walls.

After a valiant assault by the Chinese army, they broke into the south gate at 12:00 p.m., and fierce street fighting broke out, with heavy casualties among the Japanese troops. Hand-to-hand combat ensued. At dawn, Japanese reinforcements arrived, and the Chinese army safely withdrew. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Central Memorial Week: Kong Xiangxi Urges Comrades to Strive Forward; Domestic and International Situation Becoming Increasingly Favorable; Arouse Loyalty and Do Not Allow Self-Indulgence</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Premier Kong Xiangxi delivered a report at the Central Memorial Week this morning, giving a concise account of recent domestic and foreign affairs. He said, "Today, I am honored to attend the Memorial Week to deliver a report, which is appropriately timed as good news from the front lines is frequently being reported, and the situation of the war of resistance is becoming increasingly smooth. The development of the domestic and international situation is sufficient to encourage us to strive forward and further strengthen our belief that victory in the war of resistance and success in national reconstruction are certain. Now, I will give a very simple account of recent domestic and foreign affairs for your reference. Since the outbreak of the European war, the international situation has become increasingly intricate and complex. How its impact will affect the Far East is a matter of concern for the Chinese people. However, judging from the recent developments, there is sufficient evidence to prove that the European war has no adverse effects on us. Countries are as concerned about the Far East issue as ever, and the sympathy and assistance of friendly nations towards us has increased rather than decreased. Moreover, this sympathy and assistance are only expressed in actions and do not seek to be known by third parties, which further demonstrates their sincerity and purity. Recently, U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grew, delivered a public speech in Tokyo, clearly stating the U.S. position in the Far East and exposing the atrocities of the Japanese militarists in China. He firmly rejected Japan's so-called 'New Order in East Asia' with righteous words. It was a powerful appeal to international justice and no less than a head-on blow to the Japanese militarists. Our arduous struggle to safeguard world peace and humanitarian justice has thus been made known to the world. As the saying goes, virtue is not lonely, it is sure to have neighbors. Justice will eventually triumph over power. As for the military situation, the recent great victory in northern Hunan annihilated tens of thousands of enemies, and northern Jiangxi and southern Shanxi have also repeatedly frustrated the enemy's advance. This is certainly due to the wise command of the commanders and the dedication of the soldiers, but the improvement of our army and the strengthening of its combat effectiveness cannot be ignored. In recent years, politics has gradually been put on the right track, finance has been established on a solid foundation, and economic construction has made great strides. In the future, there will be numerous aspects of national reconstruction to be planned. In order to learn from the past and avoid future mistakes and to continuously progress, we should review everything in the past as a lesson for the revitalization of the nation. We are all followers of the Premier and uphold his principles. We should follow his will and serve the country with loyalty and integrity. The past is gone, and how should we establish a constitutional foundation in the future so that the country is founded on a rock-solid foundation? Comrades of our party must not abandon their responsibilities. In the past, the Duke of Zhou assisted King Cheng. Although rumors spread, he did not complain and ultimately achieved great things. Marquis Wu assisted the Later Ruler, not only to serve on the battlefield, to eliminate thieves and revive the Han Dynasty, but also to plan for personnel administration, to arrange the palace and government, and to earnestly advise on personal cultivation and moral progress. Comrades of our party, who bear the great responsibility of leading the people to establish democracy and revive the nation, must do their best and not allow themselves to be complacent. At this critical juncture of national crisis, all of our comrades should arouse their loyalty, strive to work diligently, not seek personal gain first, fearlessly rush to righteousness, fulfill our responsibility as guardians of the people, and complete the great cause of winning the war of resistance and succeeding in national reconstruction. This will comfort the spirit of the Premier and the martyrs in heaven and satisfy the eager expectations of our compatriots across the country. May all of our comrades strive together."

Also, a unit of the Chinese army recaptured Baoying on the evening of the 17th and engaged in street fighting with the Japanese for a day and night, killing over a hundred Japanese soldiers and destroying two tanks outside the north gate. Later, because Japanese reinforcements arrived, they withdrew to the vicinity of the east gate on the evening of the 18th and confronted the Japanese. For days, several Japanese planes have repeatedly bombed the areas of Wangzhigang, Qiligou, and Budian, which are expected to be heavily bombed. The Japanese troops in Huaibao still have the appearance of invading eastward. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>

<h3>Battle Situation in Southern Shanxi</h3>
<p>Xingji: Battle situation in Southern Shanxi: (1) On the night of the 18th, the Chinese army once captured Zhenfeng Pagoda, west of Hengling Pass.

<h3>Premier Kong Hosts Banquet for Ambassadors; Entire Diplomatic Circle in Chongqing Attends; Soviet Ambassador Holds Secret Talks with Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>Chongqing: This afternoon, Premier Kong Xiangxi held a garden party to host British Ambassador Sir Archibald Clark Kerr. The entire diplomatic circle in Chongqing attended. Although the German Ambassador also attended, according to the German side, the German Ambassador's attendance was not based on the knowledge that the meeting was intended to host the British Ambassador. A German journalist also attended the meeting. Soviet Ambassador Panyushkin could have had his first meeting with the British Ambassador, but unfortunately, he arrived late, and the British Ambassador had already gone to another meeting, so he missed the opportunity. U.S. Ambassador Johnson also attended the meeting, and because he had grown a short beard, he received as much attention as the Soviet Ambassador. Since arriving in the city, the Soviet Ambassador has been quite reclusive, only visiting the U.S. Ambassador once. After arriving at the meeting, the Soviet Ambassador immediately held a long and secret discussion with Foreign Minister Wang Chonghui. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Dr. Kong Xiangxi, the president of the Executive Yuan, hosted a banquet in the garden of his residence this afternoon to welcome the diplomatic representatives of various countries.

<h3>Chinese Army in Hubei Reaches Guanqiao, Jingshan</h3>

<p>Yichang: The Chinese army in Southern Hubei launched an attack on the Japanese troops at Xiangfeng Temple on the 17th. The Japanese put up a stubborn resistance.

The Chinese army is currently pursuing them. Xiangfeng Temple has been recaptured. Also, the Japanese troops who invaded Jingshan have been surrounded by the Chinese army and are currently being annihilated. (Dispatch of the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Japan Seeks to Improve Relations with Britain and the United States; Soviet-Japanese Negotiations Reach Another Impasse; Japanese Troops in Manchuria Cannot Be Reduced</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japan-Japan News reported that Foreign Minister Nomura intends to begin formal negotiations with U.S. Ambassador Grew within this week in order to break the U.S.-Japan impasse. This will be initiated first to prevent U.S.-Japan relations from worsening, which is extremely important. At the same time, the English-language Japan Advertiser stated in an editorial that the reaction of the Japanese newspapers to U.S. Ambassador Grew's remarks indicated that the Japanese side did not seem to grasp the basis of the U.S. Ambassador's arguments. The Japanese newspapers neither accepted nor found a basis for improving relations between the two countries by ignoring the key points. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japan-Japan News reported that British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie urged Foreign Minister Nomura to resolve the outstanding issues between Britain and Japan when they met on October 11. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>Beijing: According to news from Harbin, the Soviet-Japanese Nomonhan armistice negotiations have reached an impasse because the Soviet side wants to take advantage of its victory before the September 15 armistice to conduct tough negotiations. It is reported that they have obtained some concessions from the Japanese side, such as the closure of a certain anti-communist organization in Harbin and the reopening of several Soviet organizations in Harbin. The Soviet Union wants to designate Manchouli as the meeting place for the demarcation committee, while the Japanese side insists on holding the meeting in Harbin, which is another reason for the breakdown of the negotiations. According to recent estimates by foreign military experts, there are currently at least 350,000 Japanese troops in Manchuria, and the 50,000 Japanese troops withdrawn from North China have not yet been recalled. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: Soviet Deputy Representative to Japan Smetanin was promoted to Ambassador and left for Tokyo this afternoon to assume his new post. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>New York: Former Japanese Minister of the Navy Admiral Osumi is now traveling from New York to Washington and is scheduled to attend a U.S.-Japan naval goodwill luncheon hosted by Japanese Ambassador to the United States Horinouchi on the 23rd. (Domei, 22nd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today, the Japan-Japan News and other newspapers heavily reported on the Anglo-Japanese negotiations and the Tianjin incident. The Japan-Japan News recalled that British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie visited Foreign Minister Nomura on October 11 and said that the police incident in Tianjin had been practically resolved, but the issues of Chinese legal tender and silver deposits remained unresolved. It is reported that the British authorities have agreed to take appropriate steps on the legal tender issue, but the opinions of the British and Japanese authorities on the silver deposit issue have not yet been consistent. The newspaper also predicted that the Tianjin dispute would be resolved by British Ambassador and Foreign Minister Nomura in the form of talks and would not be submitted to a formal meeting. The newspaper concluded by saying that if Britain and the United States are willing to assist in the establishment of a new order in East Asia, Foreign Minister Nomura may be willing to consider reopening the Yangtze and Pearl Rivers for foreign vessels to navigate. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The Japan Times commented on the remarks made by U.S. Ambassador Grew, saying that these remarks accurately reflect the opinions of official circles in Washington, but these opinions are based on ideals rather than actual observations. Therefore, these remarks only confirm our belief that the United States is still ignorant of the situation in East Asia. In fact, the meaning of Japan's actions in China is not a matter of measuring money or seizing concessions but is one of taking practical steps toward Japan's future, both aided by spiritual impulses and moved by the noble mission of establishing lasting peace in East Asia. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: There is much hope here that the number of American tourists visiting Japan will increase in order to obtain American cash. According to estimates, 200,000 Americans travel to Europe each year. Since the outbreak of the European war, those who travel to Europe will turn to the East. Therefore, in the coming year, Japan can obtain at least 400,000 American tourists. In other words, Japan can obtain at least 150 million yen in revenue. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Railways is now actively preparing publicity work to attract more American tourists. (Associated Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Today, the spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs denied the rumor that the Japanese government's attitude towards the Soviet Union is quite contradictory, saying that although all the newspapers have this implication, unofficially, the origin of this argument may be because the Soviet Union and the Communist Party are actually one and the same. However, officially, these two are completely different. Therefore, Japan's anti-communist policy can be said to be self-evident. The spokesman predicted that the outstanding issues between Japan and the Soviet Union would be resolved satisfactorily and that the rumor that the Nomonhan negotiations had broken down was unreliable. At present, all matters concerning the armistice agreement have been completed smoothly, but some of them have been agreed upon by both parties and transferred to another Japanese-"Manchukuo"-Soviet tripartite diplomatic discussion. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>
<p>Tokyo: The new Director of the Information Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Suma, responded to a question from a foreign reporter at his first press conference today, saying that from his personal experience, he felt that the American people were mostly ignorant of the situation in the Far East and that American public opinion was based on emotionalism. Suma continued that the directness of the speech of U.S. Ambassador to Japan Grew was admirable. He recalled that a book said, "A faithful diplomat must convey the public opinion of his home country to the country in which he is stationed and, at the same time, faithfully convey the public opinion of the country in which he is stationed." Suma also expressed the hope that the American government and people would pay full attention to the situation in the Far East and base any opinions or observations on construction and reality. Suma concluded by saying that when he was in the United States, he was invited to attend a meeting by the chairman of a certain Quaker society. Unexpectedly, the chairman said in his opening remarks, "The remarks that Mr. Suma is about to make must be wrong." This incident can be an example of American emotionalism. This kind of emotional hatred of Japan and Japanese goods is quite prevalent in the United States. (Reuter, 23rd)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Shanghai Concession and the "Evil Land"</h3>
<p>The city of Shanghai is densely populated and bustling with traffic, noisy day and night. However, the western part of Shanghai is relatively open and sparsely populated. The green trees along the roads are graceful, slightly possessing the advantages of a modern city. It is known as a scenic spot in Shanghai, so many wealthy people choose to live there. Even ordinary citizens often take advantage of their leisure time to visit, which is naturally different from the commercial and industrial center. Unexpectedly, in the past two years, things have changed. The place once regarded as "Paradise" is now collectively called "Evil Land." Within a few miles, there are those who gamble and drink, and those who indulge in opium. Pornography is rampant, and even children are affected. As a result, countless people have been ruined, lost their reputations, and even lost their lives. The importance of ethics and integrity as pillars of civilization can be fully seen in the "Evil Land."</p>
<p>Tracing back to the formation of the "Evil Land" in western Shanghai, the concession authorities, for the sake of their vested powers and the security of the concession, have reportedly negotiated with the Japanese side many times. However, not only has it been ineffective, but it has also intensified. All kinds of phenomena prohibited by law and intolerable by morality are blatantly displayed without any scruples. Is it possible that the Japanese side, under military occupation, is unable to control it? The reasons are: First, the Japanese army is exhausted on the front lines, and the military authorities are eager to grant their requests, so they have no time to pay attention to the rear, which is related to their reputation. Second, fugitives from all sides take crime as a source of profit, so they collude with each other to make a living. Third, opium, gambling, and pornography destroy the Chinese people, which is not considered worthy of attention. Fourth, they recruit lackeys, who can obtain supplies locally and are willing to be accomplices. Fifth, the puppet regime shirks its responsibility and cannot wash away its notorious reputation. Sixth, condoning evil can also cultivate the puppet's position, inducing the concession authorities to submit to them as negotiating partners. Is this not the reason why the good land has become an evil land?</p>
<p>Moreover, the concession authorities, without the support of the British and American countries, would be in a precarious situation, cautiously trying to protect themselves. If they can maintain a temporary peace with each other, everyone will sweep the snow in front of their own doors, and may not be willing to deal with the situation. As a result, it has evolved into a problem of police power and a problem of housing tax. If this is not enough, they will further secretly attack the police officers of the concession, and even further openly kill the police officers of the concession. The police station reports are endless, and in the past three to five days, they have become even more frequent. Their intention is nothing more than to coerce the concession authorities to recognize their status. Moreover, the expansion and contraction of police districts and the gain and loss of police power, as well as the transfer of police taxes, are indeed a move that yields multiple "benefits."</p>
<p>The essence of the Shanghai Concession and the essence of the extraterritorial road construction area are difficult to describe in a single word, and are rarely seen in the world. When the Chinese army withdrew to the west, the Shanghai Concession slightly changed its original appearance and became an international special area. The timing and extent of this "special" period must be determined by the overall situation. How the overall situation will develop is not the issue at stake at this time and in this place. Their seizure is only for temporary gains. However, the concession authorities have a duty to perform, and cannot afford to delay and miss the opportunity. The legal basis for the concession and its terms are clear and cannot be tampered with. It cannot be encroached upon without the consent of the Chinese government, this is the first point. The attitudes of the various countries involved in the concession are not necessarily the same, so maintaining the status quo is a golden rule in all respects. In other words, the concession authorities have no right to change the status quo without the unanimous consent of all countries, this is the second point. The concession authorities must do everything in their power, with the highest wisdom and courage, to correct all illegal and unreasonable facts. At the very least, they cannot condone the so-called appeasement and accommodate the facts, and confirm the unreasonable and illegal, this is the third point. Within the scope of police power, the concession authorities have an undeniable responsibility. Therefore, for matters affecting public security and the harm of opium and gambling, they must draw an absolute and insurmountable line between the concession and the evil land, and do their best to block and prevent it, this is the fourth point.</p>
<p>For the sake of Shanghai, I would like to tell the Japanese side frankly: Within the "Evil Land," there are indeed many Chinese people who do not know how to cherish themselves, commit crimes, and live a life of debauchery. This is a well-established fact. However, to become the current phenomenon and to bear the notoriety of this evil land, this part of the Chinese people cannot bear the responsibility. Under the shadow of evil, this part of the Chinese people is also not qualified to share the loss of reputation. If this is beneficial to the Japanese nation and beneficial to the Japanese military, then so be it, and it should be discussed separately. The fact is not so, then why condone it to such an extreme! Japan is a constituent element of the Shanghai Concession organization. For the sake of Shanghai, I sincerely hope that the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai will make an effort for honor in this regard.</p>
<h3>British Troops Continuously Enter French Territory, Allied Forces Prepare for Protracted War, Only Reconnaissance Units Active on the Western Front, Polish Submarine Joins British Navy in Combat</h3>
<p>British and French Military Front, British troops continue to arrive in France from seaports, carrying with them large amounts of supplies and ammunition. It is reported that the British troop deployment to France may reach millions. Britain and France are now preparing for a long-term war. When reporters spoke with officers and soldiers, none hoped for a short war. They all believed that victory would not be easy and would require a very long period of time for Germany to collapse politically or economically. At the same time, when reporters spoke with French farmers, merchants, and soldiers, they saw no trace of German propaganda attempting to sow discord. (Miller, Associated Press war correspondent with the British Army, dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The British Admiralty issued a statement today stating that on October 21st, German aircraft launched their first air raid on a British convoy. Twelve German aircraft participated in the attack. The target was an East Coast convoy, but British aircraft, which had joined the defense plan since the convoy system was implemented, immediately took off to engage. Together with the naval escort, they drove off the German aircraft and inflicted heavy damage. It is now confirmed that three German aircraft crashed, and another is likely lost. The German attack was fruitless. None of the ships in the convoy were hit by bombs, and there were no losses to British aircraft. According to official reports, German submarines have recently become active again, and Allied ships totaling 39,000 tons have been sunk. Two of the sunk ships were over 10,000 tons, so the tonnage figure is obviously very high. However, the number of ships is quite small. In fact, the total losses of Allied and neutral ships since the outbreak of war account for only a small portion of the total losses during the most rampant period of German submarines in 1917. The British Navy's strikes against German submarines have indeed produced very good results. The Polish submarine "Orzel," after escaping from the Estonian capital Tallinn, traveled to a British port and has now joined the British Navy in combat. (Reuters dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>Berlin: The German High Command announced today that there was only small-scale artillery fire and reconnaissance activity on the Western Front. At 12:45 on the 21st of this month, three British aircraft flew from east to west over the Kongcheng railway station, crossing Belgian airspace. (Haitong dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: An air raid alert occurred in the Firth of Forth, Scotland, at noon today, lasting thirty minutes before being lifted. Afterwards, the Aviation Ministry announced that several aircraft of unknown nationality had flown towards the Scottish coast but had not entered British airspace. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>State of Switzerland: According to German sources, all bookstores in the country have received orders from the government not to sell maps of France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, so that they can be used exclusively for military purposes. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>Paris: The weather on the Western Front has gradually become colder. At night, soldiers can be heard stomping their feet in the trenches to keep warm. Smokeless charcoal fires and smoky braziers can be seen everywhere. Behind the front lines, soldiers are searching for wood to make fires in the camps. The German soldiers captured in the past 48 hours were all suffering from severe cold, claiming that they had no blankets to keep warm and only had one hot meal a day. The food obtained by the French army is far superior to the German army's supply. (Reuters dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: Naval commentators all said that the result of the German aircraft's first attack on a British convoy was very encouraging. However, the attackers were only a small number of aircraft. The rapid arrival of British fighter planes and their cooperation with warships was particularly gratifying. Strangely, although the British ships were sailing very slowly, and the German aircraft were flying low to drop bombs, none hit their targets. The commentators also said that British merchant ships encountered enemy aircraft five times, but only one ship was hit by a bomb, and another ship was hit by a bomb that did not explode. (Reuters dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The Aviation Ministry announced that shortly after noon today, an air raid alert was issued in the Firth of Forth area due to the presence of an aircraft of unknown nationality flying over the area. After discovering that there were no German aircraft in the area, the alert was lifted after half an hour. (Reuters dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>Paris: Semi-official sources recently reported that when enemy and allied reconnaissance troops were active in "no man's land" yesterday, several enemy soldiers were captured by our troops. They were immediately interrogated. Although they were unwilling to say much, they also admitted that all German food was extremely poor. They only had hot food once a day, including a bowl of noodles, a bowl of soup, several pieces of fatty meat, and a small amount of vegetables. Dinner was cold food. In addition to plain tea, there was no coffee to drink. On the other hand, French soldiers had two meals a day, which were very rich and accompanied by wine, coffee, bread, and cheese, which they found strange. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>London: The Aviation Ministry announced that two German aircraft were seen off the coast of Scotland this afternoon. One of them was shot down by a British fighter plane. Since yesterday's attack on a British transport fleet in the North Sea, five German pilots have been rescued from fishing boats and taken ashore. Three of them were found in rubber dinghies. It has now been confirmed that in addition to the three German aircraft shot down, the fourth was severely damaged and crashed into the sea. Three of the rescued pilots were seriously injured. An air raid alert was issued in a portion of the northeastern coast of Britain today. British fighter planes were ordered to take off, but the aircraft of unknown nationality did not drop bombs or cross the British coast. (Reuters dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris: The High Command announced in War Bulletin No. 98, "The entire Western Front was peaceful last night." (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>Paris: The High Command announced in War Bulletin No. 97, "Enemy and allied reconnaissance troops patrolled in certain areas of the front line today, with occasional attacks. Other than that, it was peaceful." (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Responsibility for the Loss of the Athenia, Goebbels' Radio Speech, Sternly Questions Churchill</h3>
<p>Berlin: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a radio speech last night, questioning British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill about the lies he told regarding the "Athenia" incident. Churchill said, "Only a few hours after the Athenia was sunk, Churchill declared to the world that a German submarine had sunk the ship, intending to incite the United States to join the war. At that time, Churchill had no evidence. Now, the eyewitness, American Anderson, has published the truth about the sinking of the ship, stating that it was sunk by three British destroyers. The facts are clear and verifiable. Churchill, as the First Lord of the Admiralty, could not have been unaware of the British ships sinking the ship. However, he fabricated a report and falsely accused others. I really don't know how he will explain himself. We are eagerly awaiting Churchill's reply." After the speech was delivered, it was repeatedly broadcast by translators in English, French, and Italian. (Haitong dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>Capital of Switzerland: After the British mail ship "Athenia" was sunk two days after the start of the war, British First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill gave a speech, stating that it was the work of a German submarine. Unexpectedly, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels suddenly delivered a radio speech today, vehemently criticizing Churchill, and quoting various facts, presumably based on the statement of an American passenger, sufficient to prove that the ship was not sunk by a German submarine, but by three British destroyers. Finally, he listed numerous questions to Churchill, demanding a reply. His wording was very vulgar, quite befitting Goebbels' usual demeanor, for example: (1) The British Admiralty knew that the ship was sunk by three of its own destroyers, so why did it still say that it was a German submarine that was wreaking havoc? (2) When the British battleship "Oak" was attacked by a German submarine, it sank a few minutes after being hit by a torpedo. The "Athenia," on the other hand, began to sink fourteen hours after being hit by a torpedo. How do you explain this situation? (3) What were the actions of the three British destroyers at that time? Why didn't you mention a word? (4) You are known for your eloquence, so why are you silent at this moment? Goebbels also said that the world wants to know who destroyed the "Athenia." First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill was the instigator. Now is the time to admit it without reservation. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Germany Controls North European Shipping, Notifies All Ships to Take the Kiel Canal</h3>
<p>Berlin: The German government authorities recently notified shipping companies in the Scandinavian Peninsula that all ships wishing to avoid interrogation by German warships on the high seas must pass through the Kiel Canal, allowing German officials to inspect them, and submit a list of goods in advance to save time. Once it is verified that there are no prohibited items, they will be released. This move by Germany is intended to force the Scandinavian Peninsula to have all goods transported to or from neutral countries rerouted through the Kiel Canal, so that Germany can inspect them. In addition, Germany is advising neutral countries not to trade with Britain. The Berlin "Börsen-Zeitung" also published a special edition, strongly stating that Germany can purchase all the goods produced by the Scandinavian Peninsula, and can also supply as much as possible of the goods needed by those countries. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<h3>Canada to Become the Arsenal of the British Empire, Intensifies the Production of Aircraft and Munitions</h3>
<p>Ottawa: Canada, long known as the granary of the British Empire, is now massively accelerating and expanding its war preparations and undergoing an industrial revolution that will make it the "Arsenal of the British Empire." Canada's geographical location ensures it will be spared air raids, and is close enough to Britain to allow aircraft manufactured here to fly across the Atlantic to expand the British Air Force. Canadian industry is currently manufacturing war equipment and munitions, and abundant harvests on the plains will provide Britain with 450 million bushels of wheat to feed its people. The newly established Department of Supply is now working closely with the British wartime mission to Canada, led by Mr. Leyes, to allocate purchase orders for war necessities. Canadian volunteers are receiving training in scientific tactics, with special emphasis on the training of aviation personnel. Canada is also embarking on the construction of anti-submarine and mine-sweeping vessels. At the same time, Canadian women are also engaged in a campaign to take on wartime emergency work. Women everywhere are registering for voluntary service, willing to contribute their skills to the work needed. Some groups have already taken steps to help overseas, such as responding to the call of Mrs. Liding, leader of the Women's Voluntary Service in London, to send clothes and blankets to Britain for the use of children evacuated inland. Nursing teams have been formed and will depart with the first batch of Canadian troops to Britain. Ordinary women with only domestic training are now also engaged in sewing military uniforms and making bandages. (Reuters dispatch from the 20th)</p>

<h3>German and Soviet Economic Cooperation Talks Underway, Drafting Long-Term Cooperation Plan</h3>
<p>Moscow: Regarding German-Soviet economic cooperation, the representatives of both sides have been negotiating for many days. It is reported that the German side has now recognized that the assistance provided by the Soviet Union, if it is to be substantial, will require time and improvements in transportation. The two sides are currently drafting a long-term economic cooperation plan, but in any case, if the Soviet Union is to benefit from this, the European war must end as soon as possible. Otherwise, any cooperation plan may not produce any results. On the other hand, the Soviet Union cannot abandon its Third Five-Year Plan in order to meet German military needs. Moreover, if the war drags on for a long time, it is doubtful whether Germany will be able to meet Soviet needs according to the planned schedule. In short, the Soviet authorities now urgently hope that peace will be restored in Europe, and then reach an understanding with Germany in order to cooperate closely economically. There are two reasons for this: (1) The Soviet Union urgently wants to maintain the new territories it acquired in Poland under peaceful conditions in order to prevent the occurrence of an independence movement. (2) German-Soviet economic cooperation must be carried out in peacetime and be sustained in order to be beneficial. (Havas dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Moscow: The economic negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union being held here are proceeding smoothly. German special envoy Ritter has returned to Berlin after resolving various issues of principle, while the economic delegation led by Schnurre remains here to continue discussing everything with the Soviet government. In addition, a Soviet economic delegation, led by People's Commissar Tavosian, will depart for Germany in a few days to inspect everything related to Soviet orders from Germany and the transport of German goods to the Soviet Union. (TASS dispatch from the 22nd)</p>
<p>Paris: "Le Petit Parisien", "L'Action Française" and other newspapers here today carried the news that Soviet leader Stalin had rejected Hitler's request for military assistance. "Le Temps" reported that Hitler had sent a letter to Stalin and has now received a reply from Stalin. If the information leaked from a neutral source in Berlin is reliable, then this reply has greatly disappointed Hitler. The newspaper also said that Hitler asked the Soviet Union for 2,000 military aircraft, but it is widely believed that Stalin has rejected this request and has stated that he wishes to remain completely outside the war and maintain his right to continue trading with Britain.

<h3>Soviet-Finnish Negotiations Resume, Finnish Delegation Returns to Moscow, Rumor that Finland is Willing to Cede Several Islands</h3>
<p>Moscow: The Finnish delegation, led by the Finnish Minister to Sweden, Paasikivi, returned here today. The Finnish Minister of Finance, Tanner, and the Soviet Minister to Finland, Tyriakovsky, also arrived with him. The Director of Protocol of the Soviet Foreign Ministry, Barakov, and the ministers of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Finland greeted them at the station. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>Basel, Switzerland: The "Basler Nachrichten" recently received a dispatch from its correspondent in the Swedish capital stating that the Finnish Minister of Finance, Tanner, accompanying the Finnish delegation to Moscow is of great significance. Finance Minister Tanner is known for his patriotism, and his participation in the negotiations is clear demonstration of Finland's firm attitude. In the past, when Stalin was a fugitive in Finland, he had close contact with him. This trip may facilitate the progress of the negotiations. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>The Hague, Netherlands: Regarding Soviet-Finnish relations, the "Nieuwe Rotterdamsche Courant's" correspondent in the Finnish capital recently reported that after the head of the Finnish delegation, Paasikivi, arrived in Moscow, Stalin and Molotov immediately asked him to resume negotiations in order to reach an agreement as soon as possible. It seems that there will be a "decisive development" tonight. A spokesman for the Finnish Foreign Ministry was very optimistic, saying yesterday, "If the Soviet government has the same sincerity as our government, then an agreement can be reached in a short period of time. We cannot discuss any issues that would harm our independence and neutrality." In addition, before Paasikivi departed yesterday, he had a long conversation with the American minister, the content of which has not been released. According to certain sources, Finland has begun building fortifications on the Aland Islands. If this is true, it is a clear demonstration that the country is determined to maintain its independence at all costs. It is rumored that the Soviet Union is quite uneasy about Finland's active military preparations. People in the Soviet government say that the Soviet Union only intends to maintain friendly relations with Finland without harming its sovereignty, but the Finnish side believes that if the negotiations break down, and the Soviet Union launches an attack, then Finland, having prepared in advance, and with its terrain favorable to defense, can resist for a long time. (Havas dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>Moscow: It is widely believed that Soviet-Finnish negotiations will resume tonight. People here are relieved that no unexpected incidents have occurred regarding the entry of Soviet troops into Estonian territory. (Haitong dispatch from the 23rd)</p>
<p>Paris: According to news here today, Finland is prepared to adopt a semi-compromising posture toward the Soviet Union. In other words, if the Soviet Union can abandon its demand for a military alliance with Finland and allow Finland to become a member of the neutral Nordic group, then Finland is willing to cede several islands in the Gulf of Finland to the Soviet Union.

<h3>Soviet-Lithuanian Talks on Troop Stationing: Soviet Military Delegation Arrives in Lithuanian Capital</h3>
<p>Lithuanian Capital - In accordance with the Mutual Assistance Treaty between Lithuania and the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union may station troops in designated locations within Lithuania. This month, a Soviet military delegation will begin discussions with Lithuanian authorities regarding the entry of the Red Army. In addition, the issue of Lithuania's receiving Vilnius will also be resolved in conjunction. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Lithuanian Capital - The Soviet military delegation arrived here this afternoon to hold talks with Lithuanian authorities and sign a boundary demarcation agreement. It is reported that Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov informed the Lithuanian government that Soviet troops have withdrawn from Vilnius, and Lithuania can receive it. Therefore, the Lithuanian army plans to take it over in the second week of this month. (Reuters Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>Lithuanian Capital - According to local officials, the handover of the Vilnius region has been delayed for several days, but a resolution now seems imminent. Soviet People's Committee Chairman and Foreign Minister Molotov notified the Lithuanian envoy to the Soviet Union today, stating that the Soviet government is preparing to gradually transfer the Vilnius region. Issues arising after the signing of the Vilnius transfer agreement between the Soviet Union and Lithuania on October 10 will be resolved by the Soviet delegation. The Soviet delegation is scheduled to arrive here from Vilnius by special train at 8:00 PM today. In addition to discussing the Vilnius issue, the delegation will select appropriate areas for Soviet army bases based on the Soviet-Lithuanian agreement. (Reuter Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Latvian Germans Reluctant to Return to Germany</h3>
<p>Danish Capital - According to reliable sources in the Latvian capital, German groups are strongly urging Germans within Latvia to return to Germany, claiming that communism is about to spread in Latvia. However, the results of this claim are far from expected. The Germans are still reluctant to return, while wealthy families in Latvia have fallen into their trap, fearing that the country may become communist and their property will be nationalized. They are also unsure of the treatment they will receive in Germany, so they are trying to impersonate Germans to avoid going to Germany. A German group is taking the opportunity to profit by selling membership certificates at high prices. The Latvian authorities, aware of this, plan to strictly crack down, so those who impersonate Germans may face unpleasant treatment when they attempt to leave the country in the future. In addition, many Germans sent a petition to the German government in May of this year, requesting "intervention in Latvian internal affairs." The German authorities have now threatened to reveal the names of the signatories to force them to return, causing them great anxiety. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Latvian Foreign Minister Discusses Relations with the Soviet Union</h3>
<p>Latvian Capital, Foreign Minister Munters - Speaking at a joint meeting of the National Economic Committee of vocational groups last night, he addressed relations with the Soviet Union, saying that if the Soviet Union intends to communize our country, the mutual trust between the two countries will disappear, and the Soviet Union will encounter serious disputes and suffer losses. Our country could have refused to sign a mutual assistance treaty with the Soviet Union, but it was inconvenient to refuse to recognize the special interests that the Soviet Union holds in our country. This is the reason for the establishment of the mutual assistance treaty. The Soviet Union has no intention of controlling our country through this treaty, of course, but we must still strive to strengthen ourselves to prevent foreign forces from invading, and at the same time, we should work hard to develop commercial relations with both the Soviet Union and Germany. (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Copenhagen Becomes a News Hub</h3>
<p>Copenhagen - Due to its convenient geographical location and the development of telegraph and telephone services, the Danish capital has become one of the main news centers since the outbreak of the European war. In recent weeks, foreign news agencies have established offices in Copenhagen, and Denmark's foreign telegraph business has increased by 150%. Some news agencies in the Americas send between 5,000 and 10,000 words of telegrams daily. The highest record is held by an American reporter who once sent 12,000 words of submarine cables to a New York newspaper in one day. (Reuter Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Elections Begin in Soviet-Occupied Areas of Poland; Confiscated Land Distributed to Farmers; Factories Managed by Workers</h3>
<p>Moscow - The National Assemblies of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus began elections yesterday. Reports from Lviv, Ternopil, Bialystok, Brest, Pinsk and other cities and towns indicate that the public's election enthusiasm is exceptionally high. Red flags are hung everywhere in towns and streets, and slogans and portraits of Stalin, Molotov, and Voroshilov are posted. Before 6:00 AM this morning, voters gathered at various polling stations. The majority of voters had already cast their ballots within the first few hours. For example, in the city of Rovno, 60% of voters had voted before 3:00 PM. In the city of Brest, over 300,000 people voted in the first hour. People were playing music, singing, and celebrating everywhere. Workers also temporarily convened a general meeting, resolving that the representatives of the National Assembly should "vote to advocate the merger of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus with the Soviet Union." The majority of voters did not have civil rights under Polish rule, but became equal citizens after the Red Army entered. This is the first time they have participated in elections and voting. When people gathered at polling stations, they mostly talked about the various construction projects that have been completed in the two regions since liberation from Polish tyranny. For example, thousands of unemployed people have now obtained jobs, and hundreds of new schools, hospitals, and cultural institutions have been opened. The land and livestock of confiscated landlords have been distributed to farmers, and factories are now managed by the workers themselves. (TASS Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Britain and France to Lend Large Sums to Turkey</h3>
<p>Istanbul - According to reliable sources from Ankara received here today, Britain and France have decided to lend a large sum of money to Turkey to make up for the imbalance in Turkey's international payments. Britain will provide £15 million and France £3.5 million. At the same time, Britain and France have decided to grant Turkey a loan of £25 million for Turkey to purchase military equipment. In addition, Britain will lend another £10 million to purchase British goods. In total, the amount lent to Turkey this time reaches £53.5 million. (Associated Press Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London - According to news from Ankara, a British-Turkish financial agreement is expected to be reached soon. Under this agreement, the British government will lend £60 million in British gold to the Turkish government. It is reported that this new agreement was one of the main financial and economic matters discussed by representatives of Britain, France, and Turkey during previous political talks. It is generally believed that the British government will also guarantee the absorption of the largest portion of Turkey's exports under this agreement. (Reuters Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<p>London - The Ministry of Information has just issued a press release stating, "According to news from the Turkish capital, Britain is about to lend a large sum of money to the country, but this news is not official and the figures reported are also unreliable. In fact, the governments of Britain and France are in negotiations with the Turkish government to provide financial and economic assistance to Turkey in the spirit of the Anglo-Franco-Turkish Mutual Assistance Pact, but no agreement has yet been reached." (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Turkey: Strong Military Force, Strategic Location</h3>
<p>Paris - Turkey has signed a tripartite mutual assistance treaty with Britain and France. It is worth reviewing its military readiness. The country is a strong land power, and its naval and air forces are also capable of fulfilling their missions.</p>
<p>(1) The army has a wealth of qualified personnel, which can be called a special feature. There are 20,000 well-trained officers in peacetime, most of whom have participated in the Balkan Wars, World War I, and the Turkish War of Independence, fighting for more than ten years, and accumulating experience on the battlefield. The army has 200,000 men in peacetime, which can be increased to 1.7 million to 2 million in wartime. The term of service for infantry is one and a half years, and for various technical units it is two years (the air force is also one year, and the navy is three years). The army is mainly composed of infantry, with 60 regiments in peacetime, plus 6 mountain units. A mechanized division has recently been added. The Turkish army's training has always been modeled after Germany, and in the past 15 years, it has been improved by referring to the French method. Geographically speaking, Turkey has 24,000 square kilometers in Europe and 738,000 square kilometers in Asia. The country is mostly mountainous and the terrain is rugged, so air raids and tank attacks are not a concern.</p>
<p>(2) The Air Force currently has 850 aircraft and 8,200 pilots.</p>
<p>(3) The Navy has one battleship, the Yavuz Sultan Selim, with a displacement of 23,000 tons and armed with ten 11-inch guns. It was originally the German battleship Goeben, completed in 1911. Germany transferred it to Turkey in 1918. There are two 8,000-ton cruisers, which were transferred by Britain, and two new 8,000-ton cruisers are nearing completion. In addition, there are two 7,000-ton cruisers, 13 destroyers with displacements ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 tons, 17 torpedo boats, 11 torpedo fast boats, and 10 submarines. Several other ships are under construction.</p>
<p>In addition, the Dardanelles and Bosporus straits have been re-defended and are a natural barrier to the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara. (Havas Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>US Senator Borah Criticizes Neutrality Act Amendment: "Repealing the Arms Embargo is the First Step to US Entry into the War"</h3>
<p>Washington - Republican Senator Borah, a prominent isolationist, delivered a broadcast speech this evening, vehemently criticizing the government's proposed amendment to the Neutrality Act, saying that the goal of this bill is not to maintain neutrality, but to prepare the United States for war. Britain is exerting great influence to drag the United States into the war. Repealing the arms embargo is the first step. As far as I know, British Ambassador to the United States Lord Lothian is actively trying to repeal the arms embargo. As for the European war, the war goals of Britain and France are clearly to expand territory and extend national power. This can be seen in the speeches of Prime Minister Chamberlain and Premier Daladier. In the past, Britain did not hesitate to abandon certain provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, allowing Germany to rebuild its navy, and then sat idly by as Austria and Czechoslovakia were annexed by Germany without providing assistance. What it did was actually colluding with Hitler. (Havas Dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<p>New York - The New York Times' Washington dispatch said that the debate in the US Senate on the amendment to the Neutrality Act will enter its final stage this week. The prospect of government victory seems bright, but it may not obtain as large a majority as many expect. Supporters of the amendment are confident that a vote can be held on Saturday and that the government can obtain a majority of 25 votes. (Reuters Dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>George Bernard Shaw Calls for Peace Conference, Criticizes Chamberlain</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - Contemporary literary giant George Bernard Shaw published an article in the National Weekly, calling for the immediate convening of a peace conference and advocating that Chamberlain not be allowed to participate in this conference. It is said that Chamberlain's talent cannot match the diplomacy of Germany and the Soviet Union. Germany has already conquered Poland, but Chamberlain still insists that any meeting must be based on the assumption that Poland conquered Germany as an ideal for negotiation. Can such a politician accomplish anything? Shaw also said that seeking guarantees is useless. Can Poland obtain guarantees that are superior to those given by Britain? He concluded that the government party should quickly recognize that the people of Germany and the Soviet Union are more mature than the British people, and are not ignorant and undisciplined people who should not be underestimated.

<h3>US Augments Panama Canal Defenses; Garrison Increased to Over 18,000; to Rival Hawaii</h3>
<p>Washington - The United States is rapidly arranging to make the Panama Canal, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, the most fortified transportation route in the United States. After the outbreak of the European war, the anti-aircraft artillery teams and troops transferred from New York will increase the garrison in the Canal Zone to over 18,500, excluding the Navy and Marines. According to sources in the Army here, since war has broken out overseas, troops are constantly arriving in the area. Barracks cannot be built for the time being, so soldiers are currently camping in tents and will move into the barracks after they are ready. The US transfer of the army to Panama and the US's development of Puerto Rico, which is becoming the "Gibraltar of the Caribbean," and the US's declaration of martial law in Panama, as well as the US's increasing military aircraft, all prove that the US authorities are eager to make the Panama Canal an impregnable stronghold as soon as possible. On the Pacific side, the US outpost of Oahu in the Hawaiian Islands has also been heavily fortified. The garrison is currently much larger than that of the Panama Canal, but within a few months, the garrison in Panama will be stronger than both bases and will be able to match them. As of June 30, the garrison in Hawaii was 21,777, and the Panama Canal Zone originally had 14,942 soldiers. In the three weeks since then, no less than 3,600 officers and soldiers have been ordered to go there. Officials explained the reason for increasing the troops, saying that long-range coastal artillery and new anti-aircraft artillery have been installed in strategic locations, and troops are needed to guard them, so it is necessary to send troops there.

<h3>British Merchant Ship Destroys German Submarine</h3>
<p>Amsterdam - News from London said that a German submarine was destroyed for the first time by a British armed merchant ship. At that time, the British ship "Casthartman" was sailing to South America when it was intercepted by a German submarine. The ship opened fire and hit the German submarine. The hull was penetrated by the shell, and seawater flowed in, so it sank. A British destroyer arrived on the scene to rescue the crew of the submarine. (Reuter Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Dutch People Sympathize with Britain and France</h3>
<p>Belgian Capital - The correspondent of the Capital Daily in the Dutch capital reported that "The majority of the Dutch people sympathize with Britain and France in this war. The pro-German faction is only a small minority, but they also admit that Germany will eventually fail no matter what. A certain senior Dutch official once told someone that the key to the victory or defeat of this war lies in the supply of raw materials. Germany lacks various raw materials and will undoubtedly be defeated. If its leader Hitler is aware of the times, he should be able to see this clearly. One day I will experience the powerful strength of the enemy country, and when I am completely defeated, I will regret it too late." (Havas Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Germany Brewing a Right-Wing Revolution: Talk with Duff Cooper</h3>
<p>New York - Former British Naval Secretary Duff Cooper delivered a speech here, saying that the German army is disappointed because Hitler and the Soviet Union signed a non-aggression pact, and the general public is very angry at the government's religious exclusion of dissidents. For this reason, a revolutionary movement may occur in Germany in the shortest possible time, but this revolutionary movement is still right-wing in nature, and the result may be a restoration or it is possible.

According to well-informed sources, the Foreign Minister's speech will be a response to the speeches previously delivered by the British and French Prime Ministers, and will involve the German winter relief movement. Regarding the words of British Secretary of War Hore-Belisha that Britain will not consider establishing a new order without concrete guarantees, Berlin figures believe that since the Führer Hitler has offered suggestions and the enemy countries have refused, Germany will no longer offer suggestions. Regarding the American news agency's report that former Belgian Prime Minister Chaland will inform President Roosevelt of Germany's peace terms if Roosevelt is willing to mediate the European war, local figures have rejected it as nonsense.

<h3>All-India Congress Opposes Viceroy's Statement, Demands Collective Resignation of Ministers</h3>
<p>Wardha - The All-India Congress Working Committee has recently passed a resolution on Viceroy Linlithgow's recent statement on the dominion status of India, requesting that all ministers affiliated with the All-India Congress resign. It is expected that the ministers will resign only after the provincial councils have passed the resolution put forward by the senior leaders of the All-India Congress expressing dissatisfaction with the Viceroy's statement. Gandhi also opposed the statement, considering it "deeply disappointing" and saying that the statement clearly indicates that India will have no democracy if Britain can obstruct it. According to the Viceroy's statement, which was published in the form of a white paper, the British government is very willing to consult with representatives of various political parties and institutions and Indian princes at the end of the war in order to obtain their assistance and cooperation, and to make changes to the Indian government's federal system that may be deemed necessary. In his statement, the Viceroy also announced the organization of an advisory body with representatives of India's major political spirits and Indian princes, with India as the chairman, so that India's support for the war effort can be obtained.

The Vienna authorities have also instructed the Jewish Cultural Association to quickly handle immigration matters. Three additional special trains will be added this week to move 1,000 Jews to the Jewish settlement in Poland. (Reuter Dispatch, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Stepping Up Production Behind Chaochi; Planting She Rice in Meixing Counties; Production Meetings Forcing Winter Cultivation</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Chaoshan was originally a major distribution center for foreign rice. Before the war, the annual import of foreign rice was 3 million piculs. In fact, before the maritime ban, the food of eastern Guangdong could have been self-sufficient. Now, the Shantou coast is blockaded, and foreign ships are not allowed to import rice. However, there is no complete lack of solutions for food for the people, which shows that Chaoshan also has considerable production capacity.</p>
<p>Meixian, Xingning, Fengshun, Dabu, and other counties, located in the upper reaches of the Han River, are mountainous. In the past, they relied entirely on foreign rice to supply food. Since the fall of Chaoshan, Xingmei has become an important town in eastern Guangdong, and the consumption of rice and grain has increased greatly. Xingning County has highways and buses directly connecting to Shaoguan and various places in Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and Zhejiang. Industry and commerce converge, and local products from the interior are mostly gathered in Laolong, Xingning. Rice, oil, paper, tobacco, and cowhide from Jiangxi and Fujian are transported to Meixian from Xunwu, Pingyuan, Shanghang, Jiaoling, and other places. Due to the developed transportation and education in Meixian, small factories have sprung up, and commerce is booming. Handicraft products replace imported goods, and the people get the rice and salt they need for food. However, high prices are unavoidable. Liu Zhilu promoted the planting of She rice in the Chaoshan area last year, and the harvest was very successful in Chenghai and Raoping. In the Meizhou area, rice fields are planted twice a year in spring and summer, and only fields with sufficient water can be planted. She rice can be planted in any field, without the need for transplanting. It can be harvested in one hundred days. The rice ears are cut off, and the rice seedlings are burned in the field, with the ashes becoming fertilizer. Then, the soil is plowed and loosened, and it can be planted again, saving labor for transplanting and irrigation. There is no need to divide the seasons each year, and three harvests can be obtained. This spring, Meixian, Xingning, Longchuan, Fengshun, Wuhua, Pingyuan, Dabu, Jiaoling, and other counties have promoted trial planting. Farmers plow the soil on mountain slopes and low hills, turning them into terraced fields, and divert mountain spring water to irrigate them. There are already many places with harvests. Those planted on south-facing mountain slopes have 80 to 100 grains per ear, while those planted on north-facing mountain areas only have 50 to 60 grains per ear. Since foreign rice has disappeared from the market, locally produced red rice has become accustomed to the public's taste. Those with medical knowledge say that red rice bran is rich in vitamins. Without the need to promote it, people have already become accustomed to eating brown rice, as national disaster promotes health is not uncommon. The price of rice, grains, and miscellaneous grains on the market has risen, and people have realized the pity of wasting land. Anyone who can carry a hoe and dig the soil to plant some vegetables, beans, melons, potatoes, and the like, by getting up a little earlier on weekdays and working hard for a few hours, can help the family and solve the problem of livelihood. Stepping up production has gradually become a trend in the rear of Chaoshan. In the future, when the war subsides and foreign rice is imported, it may not be able to monopolize the market as it did in the past. On the 15th of this month, Wu Qiwai, Liu Zhilu, Zhou Jingzhen, Xu Sizong, and others held a production meeting in Meicheng. The county chiefs all attended the meeting in person. The meeting lasted for three days. On the first day, more than 600 district, township, bao, and jia chiefs attended the meeting. On the second day, more than 1,000 people continued to attend. The main topic was to force winter cultivation, to make the best use of people's efforts and land's benefits, and to establish rural loan offices. Those who cultivate ten mu of land can borrow 50 yuan at an interest rate of 6%, which is repaid at harvest. There are also loans for various tea seeds and fertilizers. Each township has an agricultural instructor who provides voluntary guidance on cultivation. Farmers can store their surplus grain in the public granary in each township and borrow funds against it. In addition, cooperatives are established to specialize in manufacturing agricultural tools to meet the needs of farmers. Those who have land can take the tools on credit. Purchasing public cattle to help with cultivation and various transportation and adjustment issues are also discussed. The production business in the rear of Chaoshan is becoming increasingly prosperous.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army at Tianmashan Attacks Songjiang City; The Japanese Army Conducts a Thorough Search Afterward; Cao Xingeng is Arrested and Dies for His Country</h3>
<p>Songjiang Correspondence: A certain unit of the Chinese army at Tianmashan attacked Songjiang County City at 3 pm the day before yesterday. Four Japanese soldiers guarding the city were killed by grenades thrown by the Chinese army, and the puppet police fled in all directions. When the Fujii unit of the Japanese garrison team at the Yue Temple in the city heard the news and mobilized, street fighting broke out, lasting for four hours. The Chinese army, seeing that Japanese reinforcements were arriving, safely exited the city and retreated towards Qishi and Sijing. The next day, the Japanese army in Songjiang conducted a city-wide search. Cao Xingeng, an old Kuomintang member, who was already in his sixties and proficient in Chinese classics, was accused of being an anti-Japanese element and was arrested by the Japanese army. It is reported that he has been killed.</p>

<h3>War-time European March (Continued) London Special Correspondence</h3>
<p>— Shudi</p>
<p>Regarding the first question, anyone with a slight understanding of current international affairs can know that, at least under the current circumstances, the answer is very obvious. Its obviousness is like answering whether oil and water can be integrated into one. As for the second question, I think another adjective commonly used by capitalist countries to describe the Soviet Union might be clearer and truthfully explain a part of the facts, that is, "Redification." The current situation is very clear; if Poland is completely wiped out by Germany, it will inevitably have to rely entirely on the Soviet Union; otherwise, the military situation will turn into a stalemate, and Poland's future relief will have to rely entirely on the Soviet Union; or, after Poland is completely destroyed militarily, the future concrete and small Poland's re-establishment will have to be negotiated directly by the Soviet Union and Germany. But in any of the above cases, the future expansion of the Soviet Union's power in some or all of Poland, even at present, has almost become a foregone conclusion. If we want to prevent this phenomenon from happening, then the only way at present is for Britain and France to quickly defeat Germany; however, in fact, this is probably impossible. The so-called "partition" is a unique phenomenon in the imperialist world, the purpose of which is to acquire colonies. A socialist country like the Soviet Union, of course, does not have this need.</p>
<p>Here is another reason that is easiest to understand; if Germany and the Soviet Union really "concluded an alliance" and really agreed to "partition" Poland, then, calculated by the current strength, not only would Britain and France be unable to do anything, even if the last possible US aid were included, they would not be able to resist this group of countries on the European continent. Then, on the guarantee to Poland, Britain and France probably had already made plans to retreat; and now, judging from the current tough attitude of Britain and France, probably while saying the words "alliance" and "partition," they themselves do not believe it in their hearts.</p>
<p>Today, the political authorities of Britain and France, and the far-sighted people in general, are constantly keeping in mind and urgently hoping for: a very possible future head-on conflict between the Soviet Union and Germany!</p>
<p>Another tacit understanding included in the German-Soviet agreement, which is generally recognized here, is undoubtedly that Germany is willing to dissolve the so-called "Anti-Comintern Pact." Also, because there is a further military alliance between Germany, Italy, and Spain; therefore, in summary, in terms of international political relations, it is equivalent to Germany abandoning Japan as an ally. On this point, we have a very positive piece of evidence to prove it, that is: in the process of concluding this agreement, Italy and Spain were completely notified; while the only one who was kept in the dark and knew nothing was Japan.</p>
<p>However, as soon as this point was mentioned, the propagandists of Britain and France immediately shouted, "The Soviet Union intends to act freely in the Far East, to redify China!"</p>
<p>Will China be so-called "Redified"? The key to this question, of course, lies in China itself. For China, which has been fighting Japan alone for more than two years, it is quite laughable to shout out such words that can be "Redified" by others at this time. However, we must point out here the intention of the people who are spreading this propaganda, which is: to alienate the relations between China and the Soviet Union, and at the same time promote the tension in the relations between Japan and the Soviet Union; gradually, in a situation where China worries about being "Redified" and Japan worries about the Soviet Union "sweeping down," at that time, both sides, in order to save themselves, will accept the so-called "peace" mediation of Britain and France in the Far East. In the past two days, we have heard more than one observer here, and more than once, pre-emptively releasing such warnings. Will it be realized in the future? It is still difficult to say now. But for our long-term war of resistance strategy, it is necessary to record it here so that everyone can be prepared in advance.</p>
<p>Even more ridiculous is the so-called "reaction" of the Chinese side to the Soviet-German agreement that is being spread here.</p>
<p>On the first day, clearly, the newspapers were all saying in unison, "The Chinese side is very happy about it."</p>
<p>But by the second day, the tone had changed. "The Chinese side, after a second thought, is worried and concerned about it."</p>
<p>What is the truth? I am not in China, so I don't know. However, judging from the views and feelings of the Chinese compatriots living here about this agreement, it is clear that both of the above statements are superfluous nonsense. If the reaction in China is really as reported, "happy" one moment and "worried" the next, then, thinking about it, it has fallen for the same propaganda techniques of these same propagandists!</p>
<p>Indeed, the international propaganda war has become extremely tense, preceding military battles! The British side recently established a national "Information Department" to direct unified internal and external propaganda. As for France, the most laughable thing in the past two days is that it first closed down several communist newspapers.</p>
<p>Most pathetic are some small European countries that are caught in the vortex of the European propaganda war. From now on, under the planned propaganda of several major countries, not only will the vision become more and more confused, but, if they do not use their own judgment, even the truth of the facts will not be obtained. (September 2)</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the "Soviet-German Non-Aggression Pact"</p>
<p>The signing of this "Non-Aggression Pact" between the Soviet Union and Germany can be said to be the first major event in the twenty years since the Treaty of Versailles after the last European war. It not only shook the entire European situation, but also shocked the entire world. If a major war breaks out immediately, then its far-reaching significance is directly related to the future of the fate of all mankind.</p>
<p>The correct assessment of the great significance of this agreement will be the task of modern historians. I have no such intention here. As for its content, in addition to the full text published by the governments of the Soviet Union and Germany, which should be accepted, I have already said in the previous article about other formal and informal tacit understandings. Today's European rumors are really unusually diverse. However, after the analysis, research, and deduction of most knowledgeable and fact-respecting observers here, everyone unanimously believes that, in addition, there are still a few points that can be accepted as quite reliable. I have also raised two points above; (1) is about Germany and the Soviet Union on Poland, and (2) is about Germany and the Soviet Union on Japan.</p>
<p>Here, I would like to supplementarily record the results of the appraisal by everyone these days, which are also considered reliable, with several accompanying tacit understandings.</p>
<p>(1) In the area where the Soviet Union and Germany will meet in the future, the section of Poland has been mentioned above. What is now known is the tacit understanding for the three small countries on the Baltic Sea. These three small countries are: Estonia, Latvia, and Finland. This time, the German side expressed complete tacit consent to the Soviet Union's freedom of action for them in the future. Originally, the German National Socialist Party had a very strong influence in these countries. From now on, at least for the time being, the possibility of friction has been removed between the Soviet Union and Germany here. As for Lithuania, which is of concern to everyone, it is still impossible to determine how the Soviet Union and Germany have agreed on it.</p>
<p>(2) If the situation requires it, the German side tacitly consents to the Soviet Union's complete freedom to take any action against the Bessarabia province in northeastern Romania. This means that if Germany expands its power eastward and captures Romania into the territory of the Third Reich in one fell swoop, then, at that time, in order to maintain a buffer between it and Germany, the Soviet Union will take any appropriate action to rebuild a small country in the northeastern part of Romania as a buffer zone between each other.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding Bulgaria, Germany completely tacitly agrees that it is the absolute sphere of influence of the Soviet Union and Turkey. Germany guarantees that it will never take any territorial sovereignty aggressive actions.</p>
<p>(4) Finally, it is about Turkey, which straddles the Black Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. This time, the German-Soviet tacit understanding is that if Germany and Turkey go to war, the relationship of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact will immediately lose its effect.</p>
<p>With such a broad and detailed tacit understanding, as long as we open a map, the intention of the Soviet Union can be understood at a glance. After this tacit understanding, the Soviet Union's border, from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Black Sea, and then east to the Caspian Sea, its west and south sides are completely building a wall to isolate it from the aggression of Germany and Italy. From now on—in the words of the Soviet propaganda machine—it can sit back and watch the "world's re-division war between capitalist countries."</p>
<p>The only remaining question at present is: What if Hitler does not abide by his tacit understanding this time?</p>
<p>There is only one answer: In that case, the Soviet Union would use its own strength to force Germany to fulfill the tacit understanding.</p>
<p>The current situation is very clear; Hitler's current goal, without a doubt, is to demand from Britain and France an equal division of the world's colonies, not to attack the Soviet Union. Therefore, on the one hand, although he does not want a major war, he has indeed made up his mind that if Britain and France launch a major war, Germany will decide to fight; and at the same time, in order to achieve the complete success of armed diplomacy or war against Britain and France, he must, in any case, obtain the tacit understanding of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Therefore, when Ribbentrop flew to Moscow last time, he received Hitler's order: to sign this agreement quickly at any cost.</p>
<p>If Hitler does not fulfill this time's tacit understanding and leads to a major conflict with the Soviet Union: that is what the British and French sides most hope for. (September 3) (To be continued)</p>

<h3>General Situation of Moral Education in National Higher Education (5)</h3>
<p>(3) Assigning Students: At the beginning of the implementation of the mentor system, all students in the school must be divided into several groups, with each group limited to five to fifteen people. Because there are fewer people, it is easier to provide moral guidance. However, due to special circumstances, the number can be increased appropriately. Because the number of students in each school is different, the organization is inevitably different. Therefore, some schools have as many as 84 groups, such as Guangdong National University, and some have as few as 12 groups, such as the National Martial Arts Physical Education School. The grouping methods include mixed systems for each department and grade, such as Jinan University, grade-based systems, such as Shanghai Medical College, and gender-based groups, such as the National Martial Arts Physical Education School and West China Union University.</p>
<p>(4) General Situation of Moral Education: Since the implementation of the mentor system, the moral education situation reported by each school can be described in the following four points:</p>
<p>(1) Individual Moral Education: After the groups are divided, the mentors of each group first conduct individual talks to understand the personality and environmental background of each student, which is the preliminary work for teaching according to their aptitude. Some also ask students to write self-reports, such as Fudan University. (2) Group Moral Education: After the students are divided into groups, the mentors hold a group meeting once a week for the group they are responsible for, to discuss academic studies, conduct, and other issues, and ask students to criticize each other and freely raise questions. The mentors provide as much guidance and answers as possible. During extracurricular time or holidays, the mentors gather the students in their group to hold talk meetings, excursions, etc., so that they can have frequent contact and live together to achieve the effect of influencing and correcting them.</p>
<p>(3) Group Moral Education: In addition to individual and group moral education, each school also holds collective moral education. The methods include holding various lectures, various competition meetings, or holding morning meetings every day. Some also use holidays to organize rural propaganda teams or service groups. The purpose is to develop students' group education and increase the interest in group activities. Allowing teachers and students of Zhongzheng Medical College to live together, and eating and living together, provides more opportunities for close contact, and the effect of moral education is even greater.</p>
<p>(4) Investigation: Mentors pay attention to and investigate students' thoughts, behaviors, and academic studies at any time, whether in or out of class, as well as the environment and background in which these thoughts, behaviors, and academic studies occur, as the basis for implementing moral education.</p>
<p>The mentor system is indeed a good system for schools to implement moral education themselves. There is a national youth organization that is sufficient to assist the school in moral education, which is the Sanminzhuyi Youth League. In April 1938, the Provisional National Congress of the Chinese Kuomintang resolved to organize the Sanminzhuyi Youth League. Its main significance, President Chiang announced to the people in the "Letter to the National Youth on Organizing the Sanminzhuyi Youth League," is (1) to seek the success of the War of Resistance and national construction, (2) to seek the concentration of new forces in the National Revolution, and (3) to seek the concrete realization of the Three Principles of the People, and indicated the special tasks that the participating youth should undertake: (1) actively participate in wartime mobilization, (2) implement military training, (3) implement political training, (4) promote cultural construction, (5) promote labor service, and (6) cultivate production skills.</p>
<p>Students in national specialized and higher schools are the intellectually outstanding members of the national youth and should also receive this training. The Central Headquarters of the Sanminzhuyi Youth League then agreed with the Ministry of Education on methods for establishing directly affiliated district headquarters in specialized and higher schools. Teachers and staff members voluntarily participate in the organization, and instructors can be selected from among the principals or teachers and staff members. Students in specialized and higher schools uniformly implement youth training. Teachers and staff members who participate in the Youth League serve as mentors, responsible for handling matters under the guidance of the principal. Students in specialized and higher schools should universally and voluntarily participate in the Youth League organization in principle. Youth League members should be moral and studious at school, and take the lead in participating in various training and services as an example. All students should unite as one and strive to practice the Three Principles of the People. Detailed methods are being discussed by the Ministry of Education and the Central Party Headquarters. It is expected that the Sanminzhuyi Youth League in each school will definitely be organized and established in the near future. (End)</p>
<h3>The Key Problems and Improvement Methods for Relief and Education of Child Refugees (1)</h3>
<p>— Qian Yonghe</p>
<p>(Chongqing Air Mail) Ms. Qian Yonghe, who used to be a compiler at the Ministry of Education and is now a section chief at the Central Relief Commission, recently wrote an article discussing the key problems and improvement methods for relief and education of child refugees. The eight improvement methods proposed are quite sufficient for reference for the recent active relief work of child refugees by all parties. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Since the War of Resistance, the government and society have attached importance to child refugees as the young seedlings of the nation and the elite troops for national construction. They have worked hard to promote the relief and education of child refugees. Nurseries, educational institutions, and orphanages have sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Various child refugee organizations, such as the Relief Association, the China Child Welfare Association, the China Wartime Child Relief Association, and the Hankou Municipal Refugee Children's Education Committee, either send personnel to the war zone to rescue child refugees and transport them to the rear for education, or set up short-term primary schools near the refugee camps to implement compulsory education, or entrust international charitable organizations to rescue them in the occupied areas. Many religious organizations or schools also automatically undertake the work of educating and caring for child refugees. The government also spares no expense to promote the development of the cause of child refugee relief and education.</p>
<p>Over the past two years, various child refugee relief organizations have accommodated and educated approximately 30,000 or more child refugees. The China-Soviet Child Welfare Association has successively accommodated child refugees in Xi'an, Gongqianzhou, Xuchang, Xinyang, Biyang, Wanxian, and other places, either sending them to the association's orphanages for education or sending them to the Welfare Association and the Relief Association for education. The Welfare Association has branches in various provinces and cities, and has established nurseries, as well as temporary nurseries and transfer stations in the rear near the war zone. The Children's Relief Association established a temporary educational institution in Hankou and set up the Xikang Children's Educational Institution with over 200 child refugees transferred from the association.</p>
<p>The above organizations cooperate with each other in rescuing child refugees and are handled in conjunction with the relief committees in each relief area and the general and branch stations for the transportation and allocation of refugees. However, the difficult problems of relief and education are coming one after another, and the crux of the matter remains to be resolved. The details are described below:</p>
<p>1. Relief Aspect</p>
<p>(1) Transportation Tools: Rescuing child refugees often requires transportation tools during the critical periods of evacuation of refugees, withdrawal of troops, and transportation of goods in the war zone. It is extremely difficult to add vehicles on the railway line, but hanging one section can accommodate dozens to hundreds of people. On the highway line, it is really difficult to get a car. There are cars but no gasoline, and some have cars and gasoline, but the drivers are not familiar with the route. A car can only accommodate twenty or thirty children, which already feels crowded. If the road is rugged, there is also a risk of overturning. Waterway ships can carry more children, but refugees and goods often occupy most of the space, and child refugees can only take forty or fifty to more than one hundred people. Sometimes they sit or lie next to the chimney, just like little chicks in the furnace. I remember that in August and September of last year, the Welfare Association's child refugees entering Sichuan were stranded in Yichang, accumulating more than 1,000 people. Although various companies tried to transport them in various ways, each time they transported only forty or fifty people at first, and then more than one hundred people. It took several months to transport them all. Soon after, Wuhan fell, and child refugees continued to move westward, staying in Yichang. After repeated letters and telegrams were sent in all directions, various parties tried to rush them into Sichuan. Child refugees entering Sichuan were then distributed to various counties in the interior. The transportation routes in each county were simpler, and the tools felt even more difficult. The transportation of child refugees in western Hunan and northern Henan also felt the lack of transportation tools.</p>

<p>The second week of this year's West Union Football League features fifteen matches. Tung Wah, last year's runner-up in the top division and a strong Chinese team, will play Larks at the Recreation Ground on Sunday morning at 10:30 AM. Tung Wah has won every friendly match this season, demonstrating great vigor. They previously faced Larks, winning decisively by a score of 7 to 4. This rematch in the league is expected to be another victory for Tung Wah, capitalizing on their momentum. On Saturday, two top-division matches are scheduled: West Fords against East Celery at 2:30 PM at the Recreation Ground. West Fords, last year's champion, lost to Lido this season and then to East Celery by a score of 1 to 3. The English and Scottish teams will meet again; the English team, boosted by their victory over the West Capture team last week, intends to inflict another heavy blow on last year's champion. However, the Scottish team is determined to avenge their defeat and will not easily give in. This match is crucial in this year's league, promising a thrilling performance. North West Children will play West Capture team at 3 PM at the Racecourse. Although West Capture suffered a defeat to East Celery in their first match, they are expected to win against North West Children, who were promoted from the second division. In addition, there will be two second-division matches, including Ching Wah against Rowing Club, and four third-division matches, including Zhen Dan against Hertzberg and Yoyo against Qiu Ting. On Sunday, besides Tung Wah against Larks in the top division, there will also be a match between St. Francis and Portugal. The two teams are evenly matched, having drawn 3-3 in a friendly match.

<h3>Finance: Tianjin and Hong Kong Gangs Rush to Sell, Supply and Demand of Foreign Exchange in Dire Straits, Gold Nearly Five Pence, US Exchange Rate Breaks Eight Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday: HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged. The black market for British and American exchange rates showed a strong downward trend, contrasting sharply with the tightness of a few months ago. The principle of reversal is evident. Last Saturday, this newspaper predicted that the crucial levels of 8 yuan for the US dollar and 5 pence for British gold would be unsustainable. Within two days, this prediction became reality. Although British gold was still within the 5 pence mark, the US dollar had clearly broken through 8 yuan, reaching a new low of 8.25 yuan. The speed of the change was a wake-up call for those who had scorned the legal tender and rushed to buy foreign exchange. The day's process: the opening was calm and showed a slight upward trend. Soon, the Hong Kong gang and Chinese merchants began selling aggressively, immediately driving the prices down to 4 3/4 pence for British gold and 7.9375 yuan for the US dollar. HSBC's absorption was excellent, and the bank's opening prices remained similar to the morning prices. Later, Sassoon, the Tianjin gang, and the Hong Kong gang (it is said that the Hong Kong gang is selling foreign exchange to buy goods such as gold, cotton, and cotton yarn because Shanghai still has the lowest prices) increased their selling pressure. Due to the Tianjin gang's aggressive selling, rumors spread that Tianjin would prohibit the import of foreign goods. At this time, the US dollar reached 8 yuan, and British gold fell to 4 7/8 1/8 pence. In the afternoon, as news of the Chinese army's victories spread, the Hong Kong gang and speculators sold even more. With a lack of buyers, the price could not be sustained, and the US dollar broke through the 8 yuan mark to 8.1875 yuan, and British gold to 4 7/8 pence. However, Japanese merchants seized the opportunity to buy, slowing the downward trend. British gold rebounded to 4 7/8 1/32 pence, and the US dollar also tightened to 8.09375 yuan. Unexpectedly, the downward trend resumed, as selling pressure was overwhelming and sentiment was weak. British gold rose to 4 29/32 pence, and the US dollar reached a recent low of 8.25 yuan. The closing prices were 4 7/8 pence for British gold, a sharp decrease of 1 11/16 pence from last Saturday, and 8.1875 yuan for the US dollar, a dramatic increase of 5/16 yuan from last weekend. There was no shortage of forward transactions, but the trend was consistently weakening, consistent with the spot market. Trading volume was strong throughout the day.</p>
<p>A Wake-Up Call for Those Holding Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>The morning began without cables from London for large bars and American bank prices. London gold remained stagnant. The exchange rates for British to US, Shanghai, and French currencies were all flat. The US to British exchange rate remained unchanged. The Shanghai rate was up by 1.125 yuan, and the French rate was down by 0.01125 yuan. The Central Bank's listed rates remained the same. Banks opened the spot market selling prices at 4 11/16 pence for British gold and 7.8125 yuan for the US dollar, a slight increase of 1/32 pence for British gold and a slight decrease of 1/32 yuan for the US dollar compared to last weekend. After the opening, the market immediately turned tighter as the Hong Kong Telegraph Company sold and Chinese merchants followed suit. The Hong Kong Telegraph Company and Chinese merchants sold to foreign banks, including Chase and Hua Bi, spot British gold at 4 11/16 1/64 and 4 11/16 1/4 pence, and spot US dollars at 7.875 and 7.9375 yuan. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) also absorbed spot British gold from the Hong Kong Telegraph Company at 4 5/16 1/32 and 4 11/16 1/4 pence. HSBC's listed prices remained unchanged, and the announcement regarding the silver equalization tax also had no effect on prices. The selling pressure then subsided slightly, and HSBC's absorption was strong, causing the market to rebound to the banks' buying prices of 4 11/16 pence for British gold and 7.8125 yuan for the US dollar. Then, Hong Kong cables arrived again, and Chinese banks, Sassoon, and the Tianjin gang competed to sell, with a certain bank suddenly switching from buying to selling. As a result, the market trended tighter again. The Hong Kong Telegraph Company, Chinese banks, Sassoon, and the Tianjin gang continued to sell to foreign banks, including HSBC, spot British gold at 4 11/16 1/64 and 4 11/16 1/4 pence, and the bank sold to foreign banks spot US dollars at 7.875 and 7.9375 yuan. At noon, selling pressure remained strong, and foreign banks' absorption was weaker, causing the market to tighten again to 4 13/16 1/8 pence for British gold and 8 yuan for the US dollar, a decrease of 3/32 pence and an increase of 3/16 yuan respectively from the morning opening.</p>
<p>Various News Favorable to the Bearish Side</p>
<p>Later in the market, due to news that the Chinese army had won another victory, Chinese merchants were even more eager to sell. In addition, the Hong Kong Telegraph Company continued to sell, and it was rumored that the foreign bank McCallie was also selling. As a result, the downward trend was significant, and the US dollar broke through the 8 yuan mark. The Hong Kong Telegraph Company and speculators continued to sell to foreign banks, including Chase and a certain bank, spot British gold at 4 13/16 1/64 and 4 7/8 pence, and spot US dollars at 8.0625 and 8.1875 yuan. The Japanese bank Yokohama Specie Bank then seized the opportunity to absorb spot British gold at 4 13/16 1/32 and spot US dollars at 8.125 and 8.09375 yuan, causing the process to rebound slightly. However, the selling pressure soon resumed, and Chinese banks and the Hong Kong Telegraph Company again sold heavily, leading to a renewed downward trend. They sold to foreign banks, including HSBC, spot British gold at 4 7/8 and 4 29/32 pence, and spot US dollars at 8.1875 and 8.25 yuan. Until the closing, the banks' spot selling prices were 4 7/8 pence for British gold and 8.1875 yuan for the US dollar. The prices for this month were the same as the spot prices. The November British gold price was quoted at 4 13/16 1/64 pence, and the US dollar at 8.0625 yuan. As a result, the forward prices for British gold had decreased by 1 11/16 pence and the US dollar had increased by 5/16 yuan compared to last weekend.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Drops Eighteen Yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 23rd: The exchange market opened steady this morning. The British, American, and Japanese exchange rates were unchanged. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped by five yuan to 315 yuan. At 9:45 AM, the Shanghai exchange rate continued to drop by four yuan to 311 yuan. At 10:25 AM, it rebounded by six yuan to 317 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it dropped again by two yuan to 315 yuan. At 11:30 AM, it continued to drop by two yuan to 313 yuan. At noon, it dropped again by three yuan to 310 yuan. The trend remained firm throughout. The market opened at 2:30 PM in the afternoon, with no changes in any of the exchange rates. The Shanghai exchange rate dropped again by eight yuan to 302 yuan at closing. The total decrease for the day was eighteen yuan.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Market Also Sees Sharp Increase</p>
<p>Tianjin, 23rd: The exchange market opened this morning with firm prices. The spot British exchange rate increased sharply by 5/16 yuan to 4 5/8 pence. The spot US dollar jumped to 7.75 yuan, an increase of 11/32 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate continued to decrease by 3.5 yuan to 104.5 yuan. The "Lianchao" black market also decreased by five yuan to 92 yuan.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Selling Pressure Intensifies, All Notes Decline Repeatedly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the decline in foreign currency prices expanded, due to the Hong Kong Telegraph Company's repeated selling in the exchange market, and the Tianjin gang's continued competitive sales. Citibank also did not stop selling, leading to abundant supply. Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated new regulations prohibiting silver and money businesses from using gold as collateral, the gold market has collapsed, causing further anxiety. All of this was enough to make those storing foreign currency restless, so selling pressure increased. As a result, the British pound fell the most, by 2.3 yuan, pushing down the prices of British gold notes and US pound notes by 2 yuan. US dollar notes fell by 69 cents, Hong Kong notes by 7 cents, French franc notes by 0.012 yuan, Annam notes by 30 cents, Canadian notes by 20 cents, rupee notes and Philippine notes by 10 cents. Australian gold notes fell by 1 yuan. Japanese gold notes tended to soften, falling by 0.042 yuan. Korean notes fell by 0.02 yuan. The rest remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Reiteration of Nationalization Policy, Gold Market Regrettable, Major Players Still Absent, Hong Kong Gang as Major Buyer</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot gold market saw a red hot black market situation. First, the government reiterated its policy of gold nationalization, stating that it absolutely cannot be freely bought and sold as a commodity. Although Shanghai's environment is special and beyond reach, those who consider themselves citizens of the Republic of China should not treat national laws as playthings. Therefore, the initial expectation of a sharp drop in gold prices of 200-300 yuan was not unexpected, and the fact that the actual drop was only slightly over 100 yuan is not surprising. The morning opening was expected to decline due to the aforementioned reasons and the weakening exchange market. Therefore, the opening price was 3,910 yuan, and the Hong Kong gang bought heavily, driving the price up to 3,947 yuan, the day's high. Retail investors eager to sell were able to take advantage of this opportunity to release a significant amount. In the afternoon, due to the continued tightening of foreign exchange and negative news, the market opened at 3,860 yuan. However, the Tianjin gang sold heavily, resulting in the day's lowest price of 3,830 yuan. Shortly after, the exchange market rebounded, and the Hong Kong gang continued to buy, raising the price three times. Later, the foreign exchange market saw a significant loosening, resulting in a closing price of 3,850 yuan. Throughout the day, the only major buyer, the Hong Kong gang, was active in the market, reportedly buying over 3,000 taels. The sellers were mainly from the Tianjin gang, who sold a significant amount. However, there were no reports of major long positions emerging, so the market price was not significantly affected. Trading volume was high that day, around 4,000-5,000 taels. Jewelry gold fell by 10 yuan, while customs gold remained flat.</p>
<p>Spot Gold Falls by Over 100 Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, each bar (ten taels) initially saw a scattered market as general buyers were cautious due to news reports of the Ministry of Finance's stringent new gold nationalization regulations and further news of foreign exchange strengthening. However, a certain money exchange business lowered the price and sold, causing the opening price to fall by about 30 yuan compared to the previous day's off-market price, and a sharp 56 yuan compared to last weekend. Initially, the money exchange business sold 30 taels to jewelry businesses at 3,910 yuan, followed by a small decrease of 10 yuan. A money exchange business sold 20 taels to a gold shop at a price of 3,900 yuan. At this time, the Hong Kong gang suddenly commissioned a certain jewelry shop and securities business to buy heavily, immediately reversing the market trend and rebounding by 42 yuan. A jewelry shop bought 20 taels from a fellow jewelry shop at 3,942 yuan. Later, as sellers emerged, the price briefly decreased to 3,935 yuan. Subsequently, as the exchange rate rebounded, it strongly stimulated buying, and the price rose by another 15 yuan. A securities business bought 20 taels from a money exchange business at 3,947 yuan. Thereafter, although the Hong Kong gang continued to absorb, the foreign exchange market trended tighter, and a certain money exchange business took advantage of the situation to emerge, in addition to the frequent selling from jewelry businesses and gold shops. The bullish trend faltered, and the price soon fell by 22 yuan. A jewelry business sold 20 taels to a gold shop at 3,925 yuan. At this time, the securities business also began to sell, leading to a further decrease of 15 yuan. The securities business sold 10 taels to a money exchange business at 3,910 yuan. Later, a certain money exchange business suddenly profited by buying back at a low price, raising the price by 12 yuan. A money exchange business bought 50 taels from a jewelry business at a price of 3,922 yuan, creating the noon closing price. It was reported that after the closing, a certain money exchange business had an increasing desire to sell, and the price was once quoted over 3,880 yuan for sale. However, there were transactions at 3,890 yuan, and a gold shop bought them cheaply, raising the price back to the 3,900 yuan mark. In the afternoon, the exchange market loosened even more, and buyers were cautious, causing the price to decrease by 46 yuan compared to the noon closing. A money exchange business sold 30 taels to a securities business at 3,860 yuan. Shortly after, a gold shop sold 10 taels to a money exchange business at 3,855 yuan. At this time, the Hong Kong gang suddenly raised the price sharply, increasing it by 25 yuan. The gold shop and a certain jewelry shop each bought 30 taels from a gold shop, all at 3,880 yuan. Thereafter, due to the tightening of the exchange market, the Tianjin gang sold heavily through a certain broker and the securities business, and the Hong Kong gang's absorption weakened. The price soon fell sharply by 50 yuan. The securities business sold 50 taels to a money exchange business at a price of 3,830 yuan. Later, the Hong Kong gang bought again, and the exchange rate rebounded slightly, and the price soon increased by 55 yuan. The money exchange business bought 50 taels from a jewelry business at 3,885 yuan, creating the evening closing price. As a result, the price had dropped 116 yuan compared to last Saturday. It was reported that after the closing, the securities business and a certain gold shop sold a total of 50 taels to money exchange businesses and jewelry businesses, all at a price of 3,840 yuan. The day's fluctuation was 117 yuan. The cash gold shops sold gold at 10 yuan higher than the spot gold price and bought it back at a price 30 yuan lower, with few transactions. The spot gold price was 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price, with few transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Drops by 10 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange rate for jewelry gold per tael at Dayatong initially remained at 400 yuan. At 11:15 AM, it decreased by 5 yuan. At 2:10 PM in the afternoon, it decreased by another 5 yuan, resulting in a total decrease of 10 yuan. Dayatong changed the rate to 390 yuan, and the new exchange rate was the same as the previous rate, with a reduction of about 20 yuan for buy-backs.</p>
<h3>Securities: Domestic Debt Exhilarated, Foreign Stocks Remain Firm</h3>
<p>The securities market was firm. Yesterday's market saw rapid fluctuations. In the morning, the market was weak due to dull news. In the afternoon, the market rose due to rumors of the recapture of Yueyang. On the trading floor, the supply of shares was depleted, and the bullish side remained unwilling to sell. The bearish side gradually found it difficult to borrow shares. Since the great victory in Northern Hunan, the war has been progressing victoriously. Now there are rumors of the recapture of Yueyang and the retreat of the Japanese army from Dankou. The bullish side was further elated. In addition, the foreign exchange rate gradually increased, the gold price gradually decreased, and the atmosphere of peace gradually increased. Class B shares broke through the 50 yuan mark. If there are no special changes, Class C, D, and E shares are expected to break through the 50 yuan mark. In the morning, the market initially rose due to buying by Tongkang, Yongkang, Lianhe, and others. It then fell due to selling by Datong, Defu, and others. Despite some selling by the bullish side, the noon closing was still lower than Saturday. Class C shares broke through the 8 yuan mark. In the afternoon, favorable news and rumors suddenly increased, and the atmosphere of peace suddenly became stronger. The buying interest for the 20th was strong. Maoda and Yizhong also saw buying volume. The selling side was limited to some selling by Tongkang and Lianhe. Class C shares sharply increased by 0.6-0.7 yuan, and Class B shares broke through the 50 yuan mark. The situation was good, and the future was relatively promising. The market price continued to rise by 0.3-0.4 yuan. The total trading volume was approximately 700,000 yuan. A brief summary is provided below.</p>
<p>Stock Trading: 50 shares of Tianchu Ajinomoto Factory stock were traded at 80% of face value. At the same time, the exchange's own shares were bid at 28.5 yuan, but there were no shares available for purchase.</p>
<p>Public Industry Association: Yesterday's stock market only had one hour of trading in the afternoon due to settlement, resulting in a decrease in trading volume. However, the underlying trend was good. Shares of International Banking Corporation, Shanghai Banking Corporation, and Yangtze Banking Corporation were actively traded. These three stocks were nearly at the same level and were all priced above 8 yuan. Other stocks, such as Ewo Cotton Mill, Ruirong, and Shanghai Telephone Company, also saw decent trading volume.</p>
<p>Rubber stocks slightly softened due to the weakening of the foreign exchange rate, but demand remained strong.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Dull Cotton Sales, Continued Price Decline</h3>
<p>Although cotton saw high trading volume, prices continued to decline by 1-2 yuan. Wholesale trading volume was higher than the previous day. The Japanese Shanghai factory made some purchases, and the Chinese factories also had some transactions. However, inter-dealer trading was cold due to the declining cotton yarn market, which led to a depressed market sentiment, resulting in reduced business volume. However, the need for raw materials for 23s and 42s yarn was still constant in Qingdao. Therefore, the decline in the cotton market was slower and less intense than in the cotton yarn market. Based on this situation, the profitability of the cotton yarn factories is gradually decreasing. The supply of cotton from Northern Jiangsu is continuously arriving, with 3,759 bales arriving at the docks. Today, 100 bales of cotton yarn are being shipped to Yantai. A summary of the current cotton market is provided below.</p>
<p>Another report: The trading of imported cotton in Shanghai was affected by the sharp weakening of the exchange rate yesterday, and various rumors were widespread, causing extreme anxiety. Furthermore, cotton yarn prices have been falling for several days, and yesterday they dropped by more than 10 yuan. The factories were not concerned about any information regarding raw cotton, and dealers were deeply afraid of further increases in the exchange rate. None were willing to make large-scale transactions. Therefore, trading was very quiet. Only the Qing Wu gang was still interested in Brazilian cotton yesterday, and they purchased over 1,000 bales at a low price, all at around 180 yuan.</p>
<p>Imported Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was very firm yesterday. The market initially surged due to purchases by speculators, and demand from domestic factories also increased. Later, it became even more impressive due to the thriving spot trading and short covering. Closing prices increased by 6-10 points per pound compared to the previous day. The Indian cotton market increased by 4 rupees yesterday with constant pricing. The Egyptian market decreased by over 10 points per pound. Liverpool was closed.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Price Decline Intensifies, Further Decrease of Over Ten Yuan</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market opened with the remaining momentum from the previous day and continued to increase. However, this increase was like a flash in the pan and immediately declined. The price decline intensified and showed a tendency to worsen. This was due to the increased weakening of the exchange rate, the government's order for gold nationalization, and the bearish sentiment of speculators. Furthermore, the volume of sales was affected by the controlled exchange rate remittances, resulting in less development. The number of shares in the market increased daily, and the market could not sustain itself. However, the environment was certainly unfavorable, but the degree of decline had already penetrated deeply, and most anticipated a price of 600 yuan. 20s Double Horse broke through 650 yuan after closing. This level of decline cannot be said to be anything but sharp.</p>
<p>The spot yarn market opened with cloudy weather and continuous rain, resulting in few attendees. Although the opening continued to be good, with Double Horse priced at 673 yuan, up a few yuan, the general public wanted to sell after the price increased. In an instant, the price suddenly dropped, and the decline intensified. The warehouse receipt situation was weak, and selling was more intense. The lowest price for spot Double Horse in the outer warehouse broke through 650 yuan, entirely due to the previously excessive bullish lifting. Once reflected, it could not be sustained. It was reported that the trading volume in half a day was 1,320 bales. The price of 20s Double Horse decreased by 11 yuan, Double Globe decreased by 6 yuan, and Fairy Maiden decreased by 6 yuan. A summary of the volume purchased by each gang is listed below.</p>
<h3>Grain: Japanese Merchants Selling Off Inland Rice, Prices Rise Then Gradually Retreat Slightly, Du Rice Alone Sees Firm Demand</h3>
<p>The source of Du rice, yesterday a total of shipments arrived from Hexia, Songjiang, and Nangang, numbering 5 or 6. There were 2-3 thousand parcels of "wheel" and "baozi" brands. Due to cloudy and rainy weather, arrivals continued to be scarce, and confidence rebounded. Moreover, new Du rice is currently the genuine desired product, with particularly strong sales. Prices are noticeably firmer than other types of rice. Yesterday, local merchants actively sought to acquire it, leading to a sudden tightening of the situation. Buying prices were raised again, so closing prices were even firmer, with regular grade rice at 32 to 33 yuan, a significant increase of 1 or 2 yuan compared to before. Although the supply of Yao Zhong, Bai Ge and City rice is also limited, they have become less important as local merchants have stopped purchasing them for a long time. Transactions are mostly sporadic, so they are not as firm as new Du rice. The opening price for Qing Jiao Yao Zhong yesterday was only 31.8 to 31.5 yuan, and Fengjia Bai Ge was 29.5 to 29 yuan, an increase of about half a yuan. Old, broken, and new altered Yuan rice sales were extremely sluggish, just average. Yang Lu Jian and Ke Jian rice were inquired about a lot in the morning, with prices shouted up by one yuan. However, the market turned sluggish again in the city, and prices also retreated. Until closing, a local merchant suddenly began buying, and the market tightened, with closing prices up half a yuan from before. Special Lu Jian was 24.5 yuan, special Yang Jian 24 yuan, Nanjing No. 1 was 20.2 yuan, No. 2 was 19.8 yuan, No. 3 was 19.4 yuan, Wuhu Special Jian was 20 yuan, City was 19.5 yuan, Jue was 19 yuan, and Jiangbei Jian was 19.8 to 19.6 and 19.4 yuan. The total volume of transactions was over 8,000 parcels.</p>
<p>Another report: The price of Ke Xian rice is at its lowest. Although Japanese merchants have been selling off successively, the demand from local retailers in this street has not weakened. After the market opened yesterday, Jiangbei Xian was the first to be shouted up due to high costs. Jing and Wu Xian also saw lively sales and rising prices, with prices once increasing by 5 or 6 jiao. Subsequently, Japanese merchants continued to secretly sell off. Although there were no entire batches sold, they have sold a large quantity over the past few days, and confidence has returned to normal. Prices had already fallen in the afternoon market and continued to be sluggish in the afternoon, retreating by 1.2-1.3 jiao from the higher prices in the morning. However, after factoring in rises and falls, the difference was still a relatively large 2-3 jiao.</p>
<h3>Flour Sales to Out-of-Town Merchants Gradually Increasing</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, existing flour was firm and sales to out-of-town merchants were brisk. Recently, Beiyang grade products have seen more demand, and Gao Jue flour has also been purchased. It is reported that Tianjin Dagu once purchased over 20,000 parcels of Red Fortune No. 4 flour at a price of 6.6 yuan. The factory price for the Che Chuan brand was 7.3 yuan, only supplied to this street and restricted for out-of-town sales, so the market has gradually become stronger. The price for recycled Pao Che brand flour must be 7.4 yuan, an increase of one jiao compared to the factory price. Today, 1,000 parcels of export flour were shipped to Yantai, 25,000 parcels were shipped to Tanggu, and 19,070 parcels were shipped to Dagu.</p>
<p>Wheat: The total incoming supply from the previous two days was over 10,000 parcels. Most of the newly arrived goods were placed in warehouses awaiting favorable prices, while factories still chose to buy cheaper goods. Therefore, the market was not easily improved for a while. The Fu and Fu factories in the city only purchased 700 parcels of Jiangbei and Pudong wheat, at a price of 10.3-10.1 yuan. Speculators purchased six cars of Kunshan, Changzhou, Danyang, and Zhenjiang wheat, at a price of 10.58 to 10.5 yuan. The market was slightly firm.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Raw Silk Rises Again, Shanghai Silk Being Prepared</h3>
<p>Foreign Silk Market: Yokohama's rising trend continues unabated. Spot prices are 1,950 yuan, up 90 yuan. Near-term prices are 1,952 yuan, up 84 yuan. November prices are 1,960 yuan, up 91 yuan. Far-term March prices are 1,900 yuan, up 90 yuan.</p>
<p>Local Silk Market: It remains a firm and stable situation. Buyers and sellers are still waiting and watching. Yesterday, the American Johnson &amp; Company bought 40 dan of white factory grade silk at 78%, at a price of 4,600 yuan, which is still one notch below the high of 4,700 yuan last week. From this, it can be seen that the rising trend in the local silk market is still being prepared.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Sugar Transactions Scarce</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained weak. The association's quoted price for existing 24 coarse white sugar was reduced by a small amount. The price at local warehouses was 55 yuan, while the price at outside warehouses was 56.2 yuan. The re-export price for Tai Gu Che Bai was reduced by a small amount of 0.5 yuan to 44 yuan. B grade sugar was 59 yuan, Grade sugar was 58.5 yuan, Grade sugar was 58 yuan, Grade sugar was 57 yuan, Grade sugar was 56.5 yuan, Grade Che Chi was 41.5 yuan, Dutch red was 42.8 yuan, local cotton was reduced by a small amount of 0.5 yuan, Zhen Ji No. 1 was 56.5 yuan, No. 2 was 56 yuan, No. 3 was 55.5 yuan, No. 4 was 55 yuan, local No. 1 ice was reduced by a small amount to 67 yuan, and Jing Ming ice was 68.5 yuan. Transactions between domestic sugar firms were still scarce, with only 40 parcels of Fan Chi opened, at 37 yuan.</p>
<h3>Local and Imported Goods: Hunan Lotus Seed Production Price Rising</h3>
<p>Recently, Hunan lotus seeds have been scarce, and according to information from Hankou, production prices have been rising, so the Shanghai market has repeatedly increased. An investigation shows that local lotus seeds have increased from 122 yuan to 137 yuan. Yesterday, the market rose again by 9 yuan, opening at 146 yuan, with merchants quoting 150 yuan.</p>

<h3>American Government Authorizes Shanghai Officials to Be Responsible for Dealing with the Shanghai Situation, Cooperating Fully with the Municipal Council. Admiral Hepburn Personally Inspects Western Shanghai. Yesterday, the Situation in Western Shanghai Was Peaceful.</h3>
<p>Since the "Fake Police" and "Self-Defense Corps" ambushed the patrols at the intersection of Yuyuan Road, Yidingpan Road and Caobao Road over the issue of road construction beyond the borders, the position of the Shanghai concessions has been seriously threatened. The aim of the Japanese and puppet regime is to use every opportunity to occupy the part of the road built beyond the boundary. However, the attitude of the Municipal Council is firm and prudent in dealing with the situation. The U.S. government, which is related to the concession, has supported the Municipal Council, ordering its representative office in Shanghai to cooperate fully with the authorities. Admiral Hepburn, Commander of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, also went to Western Shanghai incognito the day before yesterday to inspect the area. Yesterday, the diplomatic community widely circulated that the consular body was about to take action against the Japanese and puppet regime. Therefore, although the situation is serious, the conspiracy of the Japanese and puppet regime will not be achieved for a while. Yesterday, it was widely rumored that "in order to strengthen its forces stationed in Shanghai, the U.S. authorities have instructed the Navy Department to transfer 10,000 Marines from the U.S. Santiago military port to Shanghai on several transport ships to reinforce the defense." If this is true, the Shanghai concession has obtained even greater protection. However, this news cannot be verified.</p>
<p>American Representatives in Shanghai are Responsible for Full Cooperation</p>
<p>Washington, 23rd (Associated Press Special Correspondent Wilson): State Department officials reiterated last night that the U.S. government is cooperating fully with the Shanghai Municipal Council through its representatives in Shanghai to resolve various incidents, such as the armed attack on the Municipal Council's patrols by armed forces beyond the Shanghai boundary. Washington officials solemnly declared that the Shanghai incident will be resolved locally by the State Department's representatives in Shanghai and representatives of other U.S. agencies in Shanghai, such as the U.S. Marine Corps. U.S. consular officials in Shanghai will report the Shanghai incident to the State Department as a routine matter and will request instructions from the State Department from time to time. However, the U.S. authorities in Shanghai are responsible and authorized by the State Department to cooperate with other U.S. government agencies related to the Shanghai Public Concession to deal with various incidents. Well-informed sources believe that Secretary of State Hull's statement on Friday, reiterating the U.S.'s desire to cooperate with the Shanghai Municipal Council in resolving the squid site incident, does not represent a new U.S. policy. It is generally recalled that the U.S. has formally notified the Japanese government that the U.S. opposes any incident affecting the status quo of the Shanghai Municipal Council during the Sino-Japanese War.</p>
<p>Admiral Hepburn Personally Inspects Western Shanghai</p>
<p>The English-language "Great America Evening News" reported that after U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced that the U.S. would intervene forcefully in the crisis in Shanghai, Admiral Hepburn, Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Asiatic Fleet, appeared in the western section of the extraterritorial road area yesterday (22nd). Some people were more convinced that the U.S. military would take over the area in the near future. However, Admiral Hepburn's inspection of the area seemed to be informal. At that time, Admiral Hepburn was dressed in casual clothes and accompanied by his wife. The private car was hanging with the Shanghai Garrison No. 1 note. At 4:00, the car arrived at Yuyuan Road and drove along the road. It could be seen that there were many police officers from the "Special Municipal Government." At the intersection of Yidingpan Road and Pingyuan Road, where the violence of the thugs on Thursday night resulted in the death and injury of Chinese and Indian police officers, a large number of Public Concession police officers, British soldiers, and "Special Municipal Government" police officers were stationed. Admiral Hepburn's car continued to drive slowly along Yuyuan Road, passing the residence of Wang Jingwei. The walls of the house were built of red brick and guarded by plainclothes sentries stationed in tower-shaped defensive houses. Admiral Hepburn's car turned right at the end of Yuyuan Road, passed the British soldier sentry post next to the Western Shanghai Railway Station, and then drove slowly along the railway road to the Suzhou River, where it stopped. Admiral Hepburn and his wife walked on land to view the destroyed railway bridge and several small boats half-submerged in the river, silently showing that this was the area of ​​the Sino-Japanese military operations in the previous year. Admiral Hepburn's car finally returned to the Public Concession along Jessfield Road.</p>
<p>The Situation was Relatively Peaceful Yesterday</p>
<p>The English-language "Great America Evening News" reported that the situation in the western district of Shanghai was tense but peaceful throughout the morning (23rd). The drizzle never stopped. Armed patrols of Public Concession police officers and "Special Municipal Government" police officers patrolled the extraterritorial road area, and a particularly large number of them were concentrated around the Bai Li Nan Road Wujiaochang. 1081 Jessfield Road is where the shooting occurred yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Incident Location</p>
<p>The Japanese military police stationed in the house had left at 8 p.m. last night. An hour later, the thugs returned to the house. It was heard that these people told their neighbors that another eleven members of their group who had been taken to questioning by the Japanese military police would soon be released and returned. The Public Concession police officers and the "Municipal Government" police withdrew together last night (22nd).</p>
<p>After that, the U.S. Marine Corps, which took over the area from 9 p.m., withdrew from the base at 8 a.m. this morning. This was the only change in the area this morning. Concession police officers and "Municipal Government" police maintained strict vigilance in the morning and searched pedestrians.</p>
<p>The Consular Body Will Take Action</p>
<p>After the new incident in Western Shanghai, Western newspaper reporters again visited Philippe, the General Manager of the Municipal Council, to ask for his opinion. Philippe said that everything he wanted to say was included in the statement he submitted two days ago. Other than that, he had no other opinions. The fact is obvious that the attitude of the Municipal Council has not changed at all. The day before yesterday was Sunday, and all agencies stopped working. Until yesterday morning, behind-the-scenes diplomatic activities were quite busy. It is heard that the consular body is about to take action on all the disputes caused by the road construction issue beyond the boundary. However, the opportunity is not yet ripe, and it is not appropriate to make it public at this time.</p>
<p>The Puppet Municipal Government Should Bear Responsibility</p>
<p>Shanghai Times reported that Philippe, the President of the Municipal Council, said yesterday afternoon (22nd) that Chuan Xiaoyan, the "Mayor of the Special Municipal Government" of Shanghai, should be responsible for the failure to achieve a reasonable adjustment regarding the management of extraterritorial roads and the dispute over the area connected to such roads. The Municipal Council has expressed to Chuan and his officials that the Bureau is prepared and willing to discuss any reasonable adjustments to the current stalemate. However, the Bureau has not received a reasonable proposal from the "Municipal Government." The entire incident is now in the hands of the Consular Corps, and the Bureau has</p>
<p>submitted a negotiation to the Consular Corps</p>
<p>so that the regrettable situation in the area that the police cannot control and that is directly managed by the "Special Municipal Government" can be brought to an end. According to a spokesperson for the Municipal Council, although the Municipal Council is prepared to negotiate with any responsible official to resolve the existing dispute, it does not intend to cede all powers, such as policing power, to any regime. Organized rogues and thugs can</p>
<p>start activities from the area of ​​roads that connect the concession.</p>
<p>They harassed the roads in the concession with guns and then retreated into the area under the management of the "Municipal Government." This is something that the Municipal Council and its police force cannot prevent. However, the "Municipal Government" should be able to control it, because the "Municipal Government" once declared that it had formal jurisdiction over the area of ​​roads connected to the concession. Thugs from the areas outside the concession but under the management of the "Municipal Government" committed murder and arson on extraterritorial roads twice, proving that the "Municipal Government"</p>
<p>has no control at all</p>
<p>over these areas. At present, the issue of adjusting the incident between the Municipal Council and the "Municipal Government" is in the hands of the Consular Corps. The Municipal Council is eager to obtain understanding on the extraterritorial roads, but not on the basis of complete "abandonment." A spokesperson for the Municipal Council also said that the entire incident has been submitted to the Consular Corps, but so far there has been no success. At the same time, the lawlessness in the western district has reached its extreme. The attack on police officers yesterday was yet another sign that the Shanghai "Municipal Government" cannot effectively govern in its jurisdiction. The Municipal Council has proposed to engage in negotiations in a reasonable manner, but will never succumb to threats or abandon the Bureau's rights.</p>
<p>Chief Inspector Bowen Inspects in Person</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reported that another attack on Public Concession police officers occurred near Caobao Road before dawn yesterday (22nd). By 9 p.m. last night, the area around Wujiaochang on Bai Li Nan Road was completely controlled by the U.S. Marine Corps, and extremely strict vigilance was implemented. Vehicles were not allowed to enter the area. Colonel Fagan, commander of the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps, inquired about the details of the incident yesterday morning. Chief Inspector Bowen of the Police Department visited the area in the afternoon to inspect the houses occupied by the thugs who attacked the police officers yesterday.</p>
<p>Italian Military Law in Caobao Road Section</p>
<p>Caobao Road is originally a defense area of the Italian army. After the new incident of the puppet self-defense corps attacking the police officers the day before yesterday, two teams of Italian troops were dispatched to defend and maintain public order in cooperation with the concession police officers. The reporter of the Dazhong News Agency got a rumor the night before last that the extraterritorial __________ has withdrawn, and the British army has agreed to __________ area __________ defense to the Italian army, and by its police. At that time, he called the person in charge of the Jing'an Temple Police Station to inquire about it. According to the person in charge, it was only a section of Caobao Road, but the reporter believed that since the area was originally a defense area of the Italian army, the Italian army could be dispatched at any time, and it seemed that the "takeover" statement was not applicable. As of the day before yesterday, it was the error of the Italian army implementing "martial law" that night. It is heard that on the evening of the 22nd, the Italian army imposed martial law early in the evening to prevent similar incidents from happening again and to maintain local public order, starting at 9 p.m., prohibiting any vehicles or pedestrians from passing through Caobao Road. Therefore, the area around Wujiaochang, Bai Li Nan Road, Singapore Road, and Connaught Road, all cut off traffic at night until 6 a.m. yesterday morning, when the situation was restored to its original state.</p>
<p>An Autopsy Was Performed on the Fallen Chinese Police Officer Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that the police officer who was attacked near Caobao Road the day before yesterday was Sun Fengkai, No. 2594 of the Jing'an Temple Police Station. His abdomen and kidneys were each wounded by bullets. After the body was examined by Prosecutor Tang yesterday morning, he was promoted to public office. First, Chief Chinese Police Officer Jin Mianhui explained the situation at the time, and then Mr. Tang questioned Sun Chen, the wife of the deceased Sun Fengkai (24 years old, Cantonese, living at No. 20 Mariss Ma Lok Lee), and then ordered that it be confirmed that the deceased Sun Fengkai was indeed killed by gunshots, and the body was handed over to his wife Sun Chen for burial.</p>
<h3>Japanese Consul Opposes the Consular Body Discussing the Issue of Road Construction Beyond the Boundary</h3>
<p>The spokesman of the Japanese Embassy said at the press conference last night: "Regarding the issue of road construction beyond the boundary in Western Shanghai, the Shanghai Consular Body was originally scheduled to hold a meeting on the 19th of last month to discuss it, but the Japanese Consul General in Shanghai, Yoshiaki Miura, refused to agree, so it was temporarily suspended. At present, there is no hope of reconvening it. A month ago, the Shanghai Municipal Council consulted with Japanese Consul General Mitsuru Sang, asking him to mediate in good faith to adjust the issue of road construction beyond the boundary in Western Shanghai. Miura accepted this proposal and prepared to negotiate directly. However, on October 12, the Shanghai Municipal Council suddenly petitioned the local consular corps to convene a consular meeting to discuss the issue of road construction beyond the boundary, and the meeting date was set for October 19. In Miura's view, the Municipal Council had already asked the Japanese consulate to come forward to mediate, so there was no need to ask the consular body to discuss it further. Moreover, the Japanese authorities believed that submitting the issue of road construction beyond the boundary to the consular body for discussion would not achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, Miura's refusal to agree to participate in the consular body's discussion was inevitable. For this reason, the consular body meeting could not be convened for a while. Moreover, the Shanghai Municipal Council did not notify Miura in advance of its request to the head of the consular corps to convene a consular body meeting. The Japanese authorities considered this to be an "extremely unusual" matter. When Miura was invited to be a mediator a month ago, he gladly agreed and planned to study and arbitrate. However, road construction beyond the boundary is a complex issue that even experts cannot resolve in a short period of time. Therefore, Miura's failure to quickly negotiate a settlement on this issue is of course not to be blamed. Moreover, Miura was still in contact with Chuan Xiaoyan yesterday to discuss this issue, etc."</p>
<h3>Approval Has Been Granted to Allow Domestic Goods Transferred from Ningbo to Shanghai to Be Exempted from Foreign Exchange Settlement. Except for Designated Restrictions on Special Projects, No Need to Apply for a Special Permit for Domestic Sales.</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce reported that the Zhejiang Customs Office required foreign exchange settlement for domestic goods transferred from Ningbo to Shanghai, and various organizations requested that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs be allowed to waive the settlement. Now, a reply has been received from the Ministry of Finance, saying, "Jiang Jiawen's telegrams have been fully understood. For domestic goods reported for transit, shipped from various coastal customs offices, and transported to the Shanghai concession area, all goods subject to designated restrictions on transit shall be sold and settled in foreign exchange or apply for a special permit for domestic sales in accordance with regulations. Other goods not subject to designated restrictions on transit, such as lace, embroidery, Shaobo paper, Shaoxing wine, spun silk, wood panels, alum, tobacco, egg products, domestic paper, domestic sugar, porcelain, and traditional Chinese medicine (excluding angelica, rhubarb, and cassia bark), and other items may be uniformly exempted from foreign exchange settlement for shipment to Shanghai, and there is no need to apply for a special permit for domestic sales. However, if any of the goods are designated by the government as prohibited items for transportation, they shall still be handled in accordance with the Measures for the Review and Verification of Prohibited Items for Transportation to Shanghai promulgated by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. In addition to telegraphing the Customs Office to comply with the implementation, you are also required to forward it to all industry associations for joint notification. Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>The First Batch of Released Domestic Goods Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<p>It is reported that at 7 p.m. yesterday, the German merchant Lihe Foreign Firm's "Moufu" wheel, which was shipped from Zhen, had loaded a portion of the released domestic goods to Shanghai, including hundreds of packages of domestic paper and medicinal materials. This was the first batch of domestic goods shipped to Shanghai since the issue of foreign exchange settlement occurred last month. According to the shipping department of the "Moufu" wheel, due to the short time since the Ministry of Electric Power's order, it was unable to load a large quantity this time. Now that the issue of settlement of foreign exchange has been resolved, the transportation of goods can be fully restored, and various domestic goods can also be shipped to Shanghai in an endless stream.</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Shipped to Shanghai Are Allowed to Be Re-exported</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, transportation in various places has been hindered, and the transportation of goods has been quite difficult. Moreover, since various places have become war zones, the local situation is special, and it is not easy for merchants to purchase and sell domestic goods. In view of this situation, Jiang Customs is working hard to combat smuggling, collect taxes, and perform its duties in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. It has been decided to make the circulation of domestic goods to various parts of the country as smooth as possible within the possible scope. Zhuang knows that the General Affairs Section of the Customs Office has stipulated that for domestic goods transported to the local port through other channels than ordinary shipping regulations, if merchants want to re-ship them to other ports for sale and enjoy re-export benefits, they can go to the General Affairs Section of the Customs Office to register within the prescribed time limit, and Fushan Sais shares will issue a domestic goods pass, which will be handled in the same way as domestic goods imported in accordance with ordinary shipping regulations. It has already been announced. It is also learned that all tax payment certificates registered and applied for in the General Affairs Section of the Customs Office before the announcement can continue to be used as domestic goods passes and enjoy the benefits of re-export. As for merchants who report the original goods for re-export, they must specify the value of the goods when applying for a transportation permit in order to facilitate inspection.</p>

<p>After the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank issued one-cent and five-cent fractional currency notes on September 29, in order to prevent them from flowing into the occupied areas, a gradual issuance system was adopted. For legitimate needs of various companies and firms applying to exchange fractional currency notes, the limit was 20 yuan per household. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency visited Director Chen of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank yesterday.

<h3>Japanese Military Police Indiscriminately Arrest Young People in Hongkou</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese army occupied Hongkou, because patriotic actions have occurred from time to time in the area, military police have been dispatched from time to time to search various areas. At 3 a.m. yesterday, dozens of Japanese soldiers searched houses in the Wuchang Road area. Three young men were arrested and taken to the military police headquarters. By yesterday afternoon, one of them had been released. The other two were reportedly suspected of being guerrillas, so they continued to be detained for investigation and have not been released.</p>
<h3>Seventeen Wenzhou Fishing Boats Shattered by Mines; Daily Mine Explosions on Gu'ao Sea, No Damage from Japanese Warships' Cannon Fire in Xiangshan</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese side declared military action against Gu'ao Head in the Wenzhou area near the Yongqiang South Port sea lane of the Shanghai-Oujiang route, it has been blockaded by Japanese warships, with numerous mines and other obstacles densely laid in the sea, strictly prohibiting all kinds of vessels from passing through.  Several days ago, seventeen net-fishing boats from Wenzhou were in the area fishing in formation when they suddenly struck mines placed by the Japanese. With a deafening roar, the boat bodies were blown to pieces. Japanese warships, hearing the explosion, rushed to the scene, launched motorboats, and burned all the fishing boats completely with incendiary chemicals. One boat that hastily tried to escape was struck by another mine nearby and destroyed. The total loss from blown-up and burned fishing boats and nets is estimated to be over 30,000 yuan. Currently, the Japanese are dispatching warships to repair the destroyed blockade line.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Bombard</p>
<p>The Hutou Du Lejia area on the north shore of Xiangshan Port, under the jurisdiction of Fenghua County, was suddenly bombarded by Japanese warships with four shells at 9:30 AM on the 21st. Because the mudflats there are very extensive, all the shells landed in the mud and caused no damage. After firing the shells, the Japanese warships sailed to a position near Huajiao Mountain in Xiangshan Port and anchored, and have not left yet.</p>
<p>Troops on Alert</p>
<p>Guo Chiping, the Ningbo Defense Commander, also received an order from Liu Jianxu, the commander of the Vehicle 1st Group Army. According to reports, the Japanese side has intentions to cause disturbances in Zhenhai, and strict precautions are ordered. After receiving the order, Guo Chiping has ordered the coastal garrison troops in Zhen, Ci, Ben, and Xiang counties to be on strict alert.</p>
<p>Sea Lanes Unimpeded</p>
<p>As for the Shanghai-Ningbo sea lane, because Zhenhai had already implemented a blockade and the gaps in the blockade line have been plugged, the terminal point for liners could only be Qiliyu outside the port. Therefore, it is not affected, and transportation between Shanghai and Zhejiang is not obstructed.</p>
<h3>Southwest Medicinal Material Exports Reach 20 Million Yuan; National Government Incentives Result in Most Being Shipped to Nanyang</h3>
<p>As a result of the National Government's vigorous encouragement of native product exports, the medicinal materials produced in the southwestern provinces of Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan totaled 12 million yuan in national currency from January to August this year, shipped overseas via Hong Kong. These medicinal materials are mostly shipped to the Central-administered Malay Peninsula, French Annam,  Luo, the Dutch East Indies, the Philippines, Honolulu, USA, and other places. Overseas Chinese are the main customers.</p>
<h3>North Jiangxi Road; Chinese Withdraw, Still Guarded by Japanese Troops</h3>

On the 22nd, a Chinese in plain clothes was suddenly added to inspect pedestrians passing by with the Japanese soldiers. When a reporter passed by at 4 PM yesterday, the Chinese in plain clothes was gone. Only two Japanese soldiers stood in a sentry box in the wind and rain, inspecting pedestrians.</p>
<h3>Scout Leader Jiang Jingzhou Sacrifices Himself; Died in Battle of Dangzhou, Enlisted Less Than a Month</h3>
<p>Jiang Jingzhou, the leader of the 1047th troop of the Chinese Boy Scouts, left Shanghai on the 3rd of last month with his friends and went to a certain location along the Shanghai-Nanjing line to join a certain mobile unit of the Chinese forces and participate in anti-Japanese defense work. Tragically, on the 30th of last month, he died for the country in the ambush of the Japanese garrison in Changzhou. When the news arrived, everyone who knew him or did not know him was filled with grief and indignation, mourning the loss of a patriotic youth. Jiang's given name was Chengjin, and he was 25 years old, from Nanxiang Town in Jiading County. He graduated from Suzhou Cheng Lie Normal School. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, he worked in an elementary school in Shanghai. His father, who upheld old virtues and possessed new ideas, had high expectations for Jiang's perseverance and accomplishments. Therefore, when saying goodbye, he gave him twenty characters as instruction: "Though the country is shattered, the mountains and rivers remain; regard your body as complete. Though my remaining years are feeble, my aspirations will not fade." With the old man's fervent hopes, the heavens did not protect him and took this outstanding youth away. Jiang's relatives and friends believe that Jiang's sacrifice for the country serves as a model for young people and plan to hold a grand and solemn memorial service.</p>
<h3>Huimin Milk Powder Company Held Shareholders Meeting Yesterday; Li Dingshi Has Severed Ties</h3>
<p>The Huimin Milk Powder Company, a Chinese-owned enterprise, has been in operation for over ten years and has a wide sales network and a good reputation. Yesterday at 5 PM, a temporary meeting was convened at the company's premises at 451 Jiangxi Road. The number of attendees and shares exceeded the legal quorum. Zhang Zhuping was publicly elected as the temporary chairman and reported on the company's past business operations. The terms of the previous board of directors and supervisors have expired. Former director and general manager Li Dingshi resigned from all positions in the company on October 6th, and his shares have also been transferred. He has now completely severed ties with the company. After the report was completed, the board of directors and supervisors were elected according to the regulations. As a result, Mi Xingru, Zhang Zhuping, Zou Sijian, Ying Shugui, and Liu Zitien were elected as directors, and Tao Boyu and Qian Mengshi were elected as supervisors. The board of directors and supervisors then convened and elected Mi Xingru as chairman and Zhang Zhuping as general manager. A report will be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record. The company was originally founded by Zhang and others. This reorganization is personally planned and expanded by Zhang, and it is expected that the milk powder industry will take on a new look.</p>

<h3>Central Community Wedding Bloodshed; Groom's Testimony Ambiguous; Original Name Du Benshi, Indeed a Newly Arrived Dignitary; Currently Head of Propaganda Section of the "Great People's Association"; Male and Female Corpses Separately Inspected Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Newspaper, a Du surname hosted a wedding at the Central Community on Weihaiwei Road yesterday (the 22nd) when a gun attack occurred, resulting in more than ten guests being killed or injured. However, the bride and groom both escaped unscathed. The groom's name is Du Chengzhong, who is the "Head of the Propaganda Section" of the Great People's Association (political party) under Japanese protection. It is heard that Du previously worked as an editor at the Shanghai Xin Bao. After the government under Japanese protection was established in Nanjing, Du immediately handled propaganda matters and was quite active.</p>
<p>The bloodshed that occurred in the Central Community hall on Weihaiwei Road at around 4 PM the day before yesterday resulted in the deaths of female attendant Yan Wenyu, Wu Qiqing, and guest Liu Bainian, in addition to the bride and groom, Du Chengzhong (also known as Junmou) and Chen Shukun, who were spared. In addition, the injured include Yue-籍 boy Huo Qibao (12 years old), women Shen Chen, Xu Du, Zhang Yu, Changshu native Ding Xiaogen, and Wu Qiqing, wife of Liu Bainian. Since the incident, all parties have paid close attention. It is heard that the groom Du Chengzhong in this bloodshed is actually</p>
<p>Named Du Benren</p>
<p>Currently the "Head of the Propaganda Section" of the Shanghai Branch of the "Great People's Association". Huang Wei, the head of the Shanghai branch of the "Great People's Association", was also present at the time but was not injured. It is learned that the men who infiltrated the guests to carry out the violence numbered four, one of whom guarded the telephone, and three went upstairs. The man wearing a felt hat and a coffee-colored robe first fired several shots at the roof with a box gun, and then bullets rained down like a string of beads, all concentrated in the hall, causing the walls of the Central Community hall to be covered with</p>
<p>Bullet Marks</p>
<p>Yesterday, the community had dispatched workers to repair the damage. At the same time, the injured woman Xu Du died at Renji Hospital at 9:30 AM yesterday morning. Zhang Yu is also in critical condition due to a bullet to the head, and her life is in danger. (Another report) At 4 PM the day before yesterday, Kunshan native Du Chengzhong was hosting a wedding ceremony with Wu native Chen Shukun at the Central Community at 674 Weihaiwei Road. When the ceremony proceeded to the exchange of ornaments announced by the officiant, Zhu Hegao, the male and female attendants immediately</p>
<p>The Bride and Groom</p>
<p>Exchanged ornaments. Unexpectedly, continuous gunfire suddenly erupted inside the hall. The bride and groom immediately fell to the ground to avoid injury, but the female attendants Yan Wenyu (20 years old, Wuxing native, residing at 154 Xiamen Road), Wu Qiqing (27 years old, Wuxing native, residing at 134 Edward Road), and the guest Liu Bainian (26 years old, Wuxing native, residing at 11 Ci Hou South Lane, Hadong Road, i.e., Wu Qiqing's husband), Li Yupu (47 years old, Shandong native), were all fatally shot. Eight other male and female guests were also shot and injured.</p>
<p>Yesterday,</p>
<p>The Four Corpses Including Yan</p>
<p>After being examined by the prosecutor Tang, the chief Chinese detective Lu Lianbao and Chen Ming investigated the course of events, stating where the murderers' targets were and the motives for the assassination. The police are currently investigating rigorously. Then, the groom Du Chengzhong claimed to reside at 92 Yugu Village, Yuyuan Road, and work at the Yangzhou Qiaofen Company's micro-collection office. He did not know the cause of yesterday's events or how many murderers there were because he was standing with his back to the interior during the wedding ceremony. When Tang asked what position Li Yuying held, Du's answer was ambiguous, claiming not to know, seeming to have</p>
<p>Unspeakable Hidden Information</p>
<p>When questioned about his previous occupations, he claimed to have always worked for the Yangzhou Flour Company. Tang then questioned the families of each of the victims and then issued a ruling that the already deceased Yan Wenyu and the other three had indeed died from gunshot wounds. Yan Wenyu's body was handed over to her sister Yan Juzhu. Li Yupu's body was handed over to his wife Li Wu. Liu Bainian and Wu Qiqing's bodies were handed over to Liu's uncle Liu Jiying for burial.</p>
<h3>Russian Children Gather Crowd of Five or Six to Steal Mother's Large Sum of Money; Totaling a Massive 7,500 Yuan; Exposed While Dividing Spoils Beside Coal Pile</h3>
<p>At around 11 PM the night before last (the 23rd), the French Concession Police received a telephone report stating that three Russian children were playing in a coal pile at the corner of the Church of Our Lady and Rubicon Road, carrying a cloth bag filled with a huge amount of cash, the origin of which was unknown. The police immediately dispatched officers to investigate. By the time they arrived, the children were gone. Subsequently, yesterday afternoon, one child was captured and confessed that the mother of one of the children lived in a Lin Da Company house and had hidden 7,500 yuan in banknotes under a bag under the mattress. Last night, the other two children kept watch while the son stole the money and secretly divided it in the coal pile. At that time, a passerby took away several banknotes. Subsequently, they hid the banknotes in their pockets and went together to enjoy themselves in major companies on Nanjing Road, and then watched movies one after another at the Grand Theater, Nanjing, and Paramount, which led to their capture. At that time, the police dispatched personnel to continue the investigation and captured three more children one after another, seizing the original loot of 5,148 yuan. Of that amount, 4,880 yuan were seized from the detained children, and 270 yuan were seized from three coal yard employees. The ages of the children are between ten and thirteen years old. After stealing the large sum of money, they did not know what to do for a moment and had no idea how to use it, so they distributed 178 yuan to another child they met. After getting the money, the child told his father, who knew there must be something else going on, so he reported to the police. It is learned that two of the children have been previously involved in cases.</p>
<h3>Stealing False Army Title; Sending Letters to Intimidate and Extort Businesses; Three Cases Cracked in One Day</h3>
<p>Recently, there has been a group of hooligans in Shanghai who specialize in using the names of the army and various terrorist organizations to write threatening letters to extort money from the business community. On the 22nd, the Public Concession's new and old Zhabei police stations cracked three such cases in one day, which are recorded below:</p>
<p>Owner of Tiancheng Money Exchange</p>
<p>(1) Qiu Yuru, the owner of Tiancheng Money Exchange at 28 Zhifu Road, residing at 10, Lane 542, Baker Road, has received two threatening letters from the gang claiming to be Army Commander He Zhong of a certain army, from the 25th of last month to the 20th of this month. The letters generally stated that the army lacked military pay and requested a subsidy of 20,000 yuan, or else his life would be in danger. After receiving the letters, Qiu ignored them and did not report them to the police. At 9:30 AM on the 22nd, the gangsters Zhang Zhigang, from Suzhou, and Chen Daming, from Ningbo, went directly to Qiu's house and handed over a third letter. At that time, Qiu engaged them in conversation while secretly sending his staff Zhou Jiru to report to the New Zhabei police station. Detectives Chen Jinsheng and Ma Derong were dispatched to arrest Zhang and Chen, confiscating 40 yuan in cash (which Qiu had just handed over), and took them to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Court 2 of the Special Court 1. The police lawyer Jiang Baolian filed a lawsuit according to law. After the presiding judge questioned them, he ordered them to be detained for further investigation.</p>
<p>Owner of Yuelai Southern Goods Store</p>
<p>(2) Gong Fanglai, the owner of Yuelai Southern Goods Store at 356 Guangdong Road, has been very successful in business over the years and has accumulated considerable wealth. Last time, he was intimidated and extorted by someone who accused him of privately selling enemy goods. Unexpectedly, at 1 PM on the 18th of this month, he received a threatening letter from Li Zhibu, the leader of the 15th, 16th, and 17th squads of the 8th detachment of the 13th Brigade of the Sujia District Loyalty Army, demanding 500 yuan. He was instructed to contact the person at the Yongtaihe cigarette paper store entrance on Jiujiang Road and Qiaxiang Road from 7 to 8 AM the next morning. The person would be holding a newspaper as a sign. If anything went wrong or the police were reported, the team leader would deal with the matter by force within three days, and he should not blame him for being ruthless. Gong was out at the time, so he did not report to the police until 8:30 AM the next morning. Because the deadline had passed, the old Zhabei police station did not send detectives to wait. Unexpectedly, another letter was received in the afternoon, demanding that contact be made on the morning of the 21st at the same location. Gong reported to the police again. Detectives Xue Youwen, detective Xu Fusheng, and Huang Shifu, along with Gong's representative Chuan Baoyu, went to wait. At the appointed time, Feng Shiyi, an 18-year-old youth from Ningbo, came to make contact and was arrested by the detectives and taken to the police station.</p>
<p>Hongchangshun Seafood Store</p>
<p>(3) Wu Wengui, the owner of Hongchangshun Seafood Store at 115 Hubei Road, received a threatening letter at 10 AM on the 20th of this month, with two rifle bullets attached, demanding 1,000 yuan. He was instructed to make contact by telephone in the afternoon. After 7 PM, a telephone call came, and they agreed on 700 yuan, to be delivered at the Changzhou Theater in the Yong'an Company rooftop garden from 3 to 4 PM the next afternoon. Wu reported to the old Zhabei police station, and detective Zhang Keqin, along with Wu's representative Zhu Xingqing, carried a straw bag containing 700 yuan in counterfeit money to Yong'an to wait. At the appointed time, Chen Herui, a 21-year-old local, came to negotiate and took the straw bag and was arrested by the detectives and taken to the police station. The above two cases were sent to the Criminal Court 2 of the Special Court 1 yesterday morning. The police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated the facts of the case and requested a postponement. After being questioned by the judge Feng, he ordered them to be detained for seven days for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Robbers Intercept Chartered Car; Open Fire to Resist Arrest; One Robber Shot and Captured; Stray Bullet Wounds Passerby</h3>
<p>After the carjacking incident near Xiaoshadu Road in Shanghai West the day before yesterday, another chartered carjacking incident occurred yesterday. At around 4:20 PM, a middle-aged man was riding in his own chartered car, passing through that area, when two robbers jumped out of the roadside, drew their guns, stopped him, blocked his way, and ordered the occupant to get out of the car and search him. As a result, the car occupant's wallet was looted of 97 yuan in cash. The robber turned around and tried to escape. The occupant shouted in panic, and nearby police heard it and immediately assisted in the pursuit, firing shots at the robber. The robber also returned fire to resist arrest. Both sides exchanged six or seven shots, knocking down the robber, who was captured on the spot, and the stolen goods were seized from the robber. He was taken to the police station for detention. However, another passerby, Li Jinqi, a 17-year-old from Ningbo, was wounded in the right leg by a stray bullet during the fierce battle to arrest the robbers. He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment and is not in serious condition.</p>
<h3>Yuan Ying's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Yuan Ying, the president of the Chinese Buddhist Association, has not been released since being kidnapped from Yuanming Sutra Hall at 443 Great Western Road. According to the Datong News Agency, the Buddhist Association received news yesterday that Yuan Ying's whereabouts are gradually becoming clear. It is said that he is currently detained in a certain Japanese military unit next to the former Women and Children Relief Home in Jiangwan and has been interrogated several times. Therefore, people in the Buddhist community are deeply concerned about his fate.</p>
<h3>Wan Tailong Robbery Cracked; Ten Male and Female Criminals Arrested; Confessed that the Robber Gang is a Certain Unit; Sent to Court Yesterday for Detention and Investigation</h3>
<p>Xia Laosan, a 23-year-old from Yancheng, has been running a small teahouse on Great Western Road, taking in Chen Xiaolong (24 years old) and Sun Xiaoerzi (23 years old) from Funing as apprentices. They were originally rickshaw pullers and "tiger cart" pullers for a living. Xia, in the special area of Shanghai West, gathered his apprentices and organized a certain unit, obtaining weapons. On the 12th of this month, he led his apprentices with several box guns and</p>
<p>Hand Grenades, etc.</p>
<p>Weapons, to the Wan Tailong hookah shop at 218 Avenue Edward VII, looting more than 6,000 yuan in cash and two gold bars worth several thousand yuan. After robbing the huge sum of money, they purchased Western-style clothes and engaged in prostitution and gambling, and deposited a portion of the looted money, 1,000 yuan, with Gong Jiating, a Jiangxi native, at 112 Maiqi Lane, Maiqi Road. After the incident, the Wan Tailong hookah shop reported the information to the French Concession Police and requested the investigation of the robbers. On the 20th of this month, the French Concession Police</p>
<p>According to Confidential Information</p>
<p>It was reported that several robbers were hiding in Room 76 of the Third Chunjiang Inn on Balizhao Street, so a large number of Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to search the premises. As a result, the robbers Chen Xiaolong, Sun Xiaoerzi, Wang Xiaowuzi (23 years old, Jiangbei native), Liu Kun (28 years old, Yancheng native), Li Damao (28 years old, Anhui native), and the ringleader Xia Laosan and Xia's mistress Xu (22 years old, Gaoyou native), and so on, were taken into custody. According to Xia's confession, there were</p>
<p>Four Pistols</p>
<p>Stored in the Yingkang Inn at 71 Maiqi Road. The police chief ordered detectives to search and found two pistols and 82 bullets in the alcove room at 71 Maiqi Road, the residence of the owner of the Rongkang Inn, and arrested the tea boy Peng Liansheng (31 years old, Liyang native). According to the arrested criminals, Xue Zhonglian (34 years old, Shaanxi native), an employee of the Wan Tailong shop, was the inside connection for the robbery. Therefore, the police arrested Xue Zhongshu and, at the same time, arrested Gong Jiating, etc. Now</p>
<p>The Police Authorities</p>
<p>Because in addition to committing this robbery case, these individuals are also suspected of committing other major cases and need to be thoroughly investigated, the arrested criminals were sent to the Criminal Court 1 of the Second Special Court at around 3 PM yesterday to request detention for investigation. The judge Sun Pengxian was promoted to court for interrogation. The defendants Chen Xiaolong, Wang Xiaowuzi, and Sun Xiaoerzi all confessed to being commanded by Laotouzi (referring to Xia Laosan) and holding guns to rob the Wan Tailong hookah shop. Xia Laosan said that Chen Xiaolong and others are all</p>
<p>My Subordinates</p>
<p>They went to rob, I was not aware of it. As for the pistols seized, they were used by the brothers in the unit. I had already taken the other two pistols to Caojiadu and put them in the unit. According to Xue Zhonglian's confession, Wu (I) believe that Nei Qian, Gong Jiating, Liu Kun, Peng Liansheng, Li Damao, and Xia Xu are all involved in the criminal group. The court verified the words and ordered that the ten male and female defendants be detained for further investigation on November 10.</p>
<p>Weather Report</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast at 4:30 PM yesterday stated that Shandong and the surrounding areas would be partly cloudy and sunny with strong northwest to northeast winds. Here and in the East China Sea, it would change from cloudy to sudden rain and then become partly cloudy with fairly strong northeast to east winds. Also, in the 24 hours before 3 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in this city was 63.9 and the lowest was 58.8. On the same day last year, the highest was 74.1 and the lowest was 49.3.</p>
<h3>Retired Detective Shao Hejun Shot and Killed by Robbers While Resisting; Body Examined and Claimed by His Wife; His Concubine Has Been Discharged After Bandaging</h3>
<p>Shao Hejun, a 57-year-old from Ningbo, worked as a Chinese detective number 5 in the Hongkou Police Station of the Public Concession for more than ten years. At that time, he was well-known for his competent handling of affairs and repeatedly solving major cases. He retired more than ten years ago and has lived in a self-built residence at 6, Lane 924, Lao Ning'an Lane, Haining Road. He had one wife and one concubine and had a son who died in January of last year after getting married. Unexpectedly, at around 6:15 PM the day before yesterday, five robbers broke into his home. Three of the robbers were holding pistols. They robbed 600 yuan in cash and a small amount of jewelry. When Shao attempted to resist, the robbers opened fire, resulting in two bullets hitting him, one bullet hitting the vital part of his brain. His concubine, Wu, was also hit by a bullet. Seeing that they had committed a major crime, the robbers immediately fled. The Huiji Police Station was notified and immediately ordered a large number of detectives to rush to the scene to apprehend them, but the robbers had already fled far away. The injured were taken to the hospital for treatment, but Shao died of his injuries at around 6 AM yesterday. After examining the body, police chief Yin Xingsheng and Zhang Hexiang described the incident and said that the police station had ordered its subordinates to strictly apprehend the murderous robbers and make every effort to capture the remaining members of the gang. After Tang asked the victim's family, he ordered the corpse's wife, Shao Zhuang, to claim the body for coffin burial. Shao's concubine,  Wu, because the injury was light, had been discharged from the hospital and returned home at 3 PM yesterday.</p>

<h3>Talking about Diaries</h3>
<p>— Ding Shan</p>
<p>I only started writing a diary regularly this year. I often hear that some great man never forgets to write a diary even in his busy schedule. Although I don't have the ambition to be a great man, and I don't quite believe in this kind of flattery, I think writing a diary every day is also a way to train perseverance, so I did it.</p>
<p>Looking at past diaries is indeed a wonderful way to pass the time, experiencing and recalling the process of changes in one's life and mood. How interesting! Questioning yourself, arguing with yourself, succeeding yourself, and also failing yourself, the so-called battle between conscience and reality, it leaves us with it when things have passed.</p>
<p>It seems that Yu Dafu said that diaries should occupy the highest position in literature because diaries can express true emotions, and the preciousness of true emotions goes without saying. To be honest, the texts we see now, taking "memories", "mourning", etc., of lyrical prose as examples, how many articles can guarantee their authenticity? As for diaries, because they are not public, there is no need to avoid taboos or need to fabricate things. However, if a second person sees it, wouldn't it be able to "shake the soul"?</p>
<p>But unfortunately, if a diary has some possibility of being seen by others, its authenticity is greatly reduced. As for the diaries of those gentlemen who intend to publish them or prepare to have them printed in stone after a hundred years, it goes without saying.</p>
<p>There is also a situation, like me, because there are many eyes and ears around, I am hesitant to write, and I don't write what I am not happy with. So, after reviewing the "handwriting", sometimes there are a few words that even I don't recognize, or there are a few sentences that I can't even explain. This kind of diary has nothing to do with truth or untruth.</p>
<p>Diaries are like this, and letters, speeches, novels, etc., which are one level below diaries, are even more unthinkable. Although they still have their respective values.</p>
<p>Solomon said: "The words of a wise man are stored in his heart, only a foolish fellow puts his heart outside for people to see." Solomon is indeed the smartest, and he also knows that a diary is still "outside", unless it can be placed inside the chest like a heart, then it cannot have completely true emotions.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are many smart people in the world, but undoubtedly there are also fools. As long as he moves his pen, although he is not writing a diary, these articles still make people unhappy. In this way, they will turn around and blame the fool, so the fool suffers.</p>
<p>I am also a smart person! If I don't be a smart person, what will become of me? Can't a South American girl with her heart exposed survive for three days?</p>
<h3>Night Crossing on the Han River</h3>
<p>— Xu Ye</p>
<p>Lingdong Postscript</p>
<p>The vast Han River flows eastward. The setting sun of dusk kisses the distant mountains, making the surroundings of the river even more desolate and quiet.</p>
<p>This group of us, just arrived from the city, men and women, more than a dozen people forming a team, carrying on our backs are packages, water bottles, and some miscellaneous comfort goods...</p>
<p>The sandy plain unfolds with a vast coldness and silence, no village meetings, no lights, the autumn wind sometimes blowing down a fallen leaf, a rustling sound...</p>
<p>"What? Look—"</p>
<p>"Oh! Fallen leaves! One, two,"</p>
<p>Everyone held infinite excitement, each playing with the autumn leaves in their hands. Although its life is now withered, its rebirth is entrusted to the future, in the present, in the spring days after winter.</p>
<p>Along the long embankment, moving forward, the river water ripples, letting the sound of the water coordinate with our steps. From time to time, the night wind sweeps across our faces, bringing fine dust...</p>
<p>Night has indeed come. Everything is hazy. Those in the front cannot see those behind them clearly.</p>
<p>"Wow! Why is the Han River so long?" A companion's voice came from behind.</p>
<p>"Yes! Look again, the Han River is the graveyard where the Di people were buried."</p>
<p>The sound waves surged in the night sky, on the vast river surface.</p>
<p>The sky, as far as the eye can see, is black and gloomy. The night covers the countryside, and the surrounding mountains appear only as black shadows. Glimpses of shooting stars streaking by in our progress, a line of swirling light, give us an understanding of the direction ahead.</p>
<p>Now, we have arrived at the ancient ferry of the Han River.</p>
<p>"Where is the boat?"</p>
<p>"Won't the one across the way come? Pay attention to the reflection on the water..."</p>
<p>Everything is black under the dark fog. The water of the Han River also reflects black. The boat is coming over, but the distant ferry is hard to discern. Standing in the pavilion, the cold wind whips. When will the boat come? No one knows.</p>
<p>Another shooting star flies westward and falls. Everyone opens their eyes wide with excitement again.</p>
<p>Waiting, waiting, suddenly a companion shouts in surprise:</p>
<p>"The ferry is coming, it's coming!..."</p>
<p>"Everyone, cross the river!"</p>
<p>Wrapped in the night fog, the shadow of the boat on the river's surface can be seen vaguely, floating and bobbing, making a splashing sound. The reeds on the bank seem to be trembling, and the sound of the oars approaches the riverside.</p>
<p>"Who is it? Where are you from?"</p>
<p>The old man on the river asks.</p>
<p>"We are from the city, traveling at night."</p>
<p>The lamplight in the cabin is like a bean, vaguely revealing that the old man in charge of the ferry is sizing up this group of young night travelers—strangers, men and women, rushing from the city...</p>
<p>"To the regiment headquarters at Chen Family Ancestral Hall, isn't it far?"</p>
<p>"If the wind is favorable at night, you can get there by tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>He smiles, nodding often as he speaks to us.</p>
<p>The boat moves upstream, slowly.</p>
<p>"Han River! Our blood, ceaselessly flowing river..."</p>
<p>In the vast night sky, even shooting stars can no longer be seen. On both sides of the river, the boundless reeds sway sparsely and densely. A few cries of wild geese occasionally come from the long sky, and the sound of the oars stirs up waves. The distant barking of dogs intermittently penetrates our eardrums. When the hazy village drum drifts past the treetops, we ask each other in surprise again:</p>
<p>"How many beats? The second watch or the third watch?"</p>
<p>The old man rowing the oars strikes a match and takes a puff of yellow tobacco. "Not far now! I hear the fourth watch is about to be struck."</p>
<p>The damp wind blows on the lamp on the boat. In the flickering dim light, we see ourselves fading away. The master holding the rudder leisurely holds his smoking pipe, humming a sailing song more comfortably.</p>
<p>The rooster crows.</p>
<p>The tides of the Han River surge. Dawn is not far away.</p>
<h3>A Work of Experience</h3>
<p>— Xia Renlin</p>
<p>"An Introduction to Modern Journalism"</p>
<p>China's journalism has, so to speak, already developed considerably, and the study of journalism has also aroused a strong interest among young people; however, the works on journalism are still pitifully scarce. It is really difficult for those who are interested in research to find one or two specialized works suitable for the times.</p>
<p>Recently, World Book Co. published a new book by Chu Yukun, "An Introduction to Modern Journalism." The content is based on European and American journalism theory, supplemented by the author's experience gained from many years of service in the newspaper industry. The 200-page book contains very rich material. With this book, the shortcomings in journalism publications can be greatly compensated for. Although the author calls it a first attempt in the preface, it can be regarded as an authoritative work that emphasizes both theory and practice.</p>
<p>The book is divided into thirteen chapters: (1) Introduction; (2) Trends in Modern Newspapers; (3) Organization of Modern Newspaper Offices; (4) Editorials; (5) Editing; (6) News Gathering; (7) Public Opinion and Propaganda; (8) Wartime News; (9) Printing; (10) Newspaper Management; (11) Advertising; (12) Newspaper Distribution; (13) News Laws.</p>
<p>The reason why this book is worth promoting is that it outlines the problems in various departments of journalism, from principles and history to practical problems such as editing, interviewing, management, advertising, distribution, and printing. At the same time, each chapter and section has its own essence, far beyond the general introductory works.</p>
<p>There are three chapters here that need to be specifically introduced. One is "Trends in Modern Newspapers." On the one hand, the author writes in detail about the astonishing development of newspapers in the 20th century: mass production, well-informed news, beautiful forms, and rich content. At the same time, it also points out the various crises that have emerged with the development of the newspaper industry, such as the lack of freedom of speech, the spread of yellow journalism, and the manipulation of advertisers, which are all neglected by the public. The second and third are the chapters on public opinion and propaganda and wartime news. After discussing the meaning of public opinion and the goals of propaganda, the author goes on to elaborate on wartime news policies, wartime news gathering, and wartime international propaganda. These issues are so pressing and realistic in China at the current stage of the War of Resistance!</p>
<p>However, strictly speaking, this book seems to lack perfection in terms of interviewing, because the work of interviewing is the most complex and difficult to deal with. It requires a lot of wisdom and skill to be competent and happy, so a short chapter is really not thorough enough. However, this is not enough to be a defect of the book. For young people who aspire to join the journalism industry, this book is still the most suitable reading material.</p>
<h3>Rainy Night</h3>
<p>— Qian Hongjin</p>
<p>I woke up at midnight. Raindrops were hitting the glass window tightly, heavily, sound after sound, like a wooden mallet gently knocking on my heart.</p>
<p>Rain falls in puddles, and you can hear the sound of water flowing, followed by a second splash. When it falls on the open-air shed covered with zinc sheet metal, it is as crisp as pearls falling on a jade plate, each drop countable.</p>
<p>Along with the sound of rain, I intermittently think of the jujube tree in the old house garden, the thatched cottage in my hometown, the lush and winding mountains, and the Cihu Lake, similar to the Slender West Lake.</p>
<p>I am immersed in the net of memories. The sound of rain is like a harmonious accompaniment, making me even more intoxicated. But along with the sound of rain, I also intermittently think of the soldiers treading in trenches with water up to their waists, the displaced victims, the end-of-century crazy enjoyment, and the new China in difficult childbirth. The sound of rain is also like an angry accusation, a generous lament... Ah, I am clutching my own hair tightly.</p>
<p>Inside and outside the room, everything is black and gloomy, like Turkish women in the feudal era wearing thick black veils. "Where is the light?" I ask. But I also know that the rain can sweep away the darkness of the long night and wash away the records of shame. After a night of showers, won't the rising sun shine again in the morning, the whole universe bathed in the sacred water of light?</p>
<p>Outside the window, the rain is getting heavier, like a torrent breaking through the embankment, pouring and rushing from the gaps in the sky, violently hitting the roof tiles; I imagine that the roof tiles must be stirring up a long period of accumulated dust. Rain! Like the winter night raging through a vast forest, like millions of warhorses galloping forward.</p>

<h3>On the "Substance" of "Substance in Words"</h3>
<p>— Bian Luo</p>
<p>"Substance in words" is not only a requirement for short works, but also a requirement for long masterpieces; if it is just something like "Today the weather is hahaha," whether it is long or short, it should be thrown into the latrine without any pity.</p>
<p>The world does not lack things that can be spoken of. Especially in this great era, if you are afraid that speaking and speaking will eventually become clichés, and clichés have in fact proved that they are still needed even in remote areas: what is not needed is that batch of absurdities, they are about to talk about "absurdities" to the point of "nothing." So it is still "Today the weather is hahaha."</p>
<p>Putting aside "clichés" or descriptions of production and construction or social forms, there are still many "things" here and now. Drop a drop of sewage, and you can see the wriggling of many small organisms under a microscope. Are there typhoid germs in it? Or it is also worth talking about whether it will cause cholera vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>People are only afraid that the world is too calm. Imagining demons showing their true forms and foxes revealing their tails is a dream. But there are still those who are not deeply versed in the Dao, scratching an itch and shaking, touching a painful wound, and then turning their heads back.</p>
<p>But this cannot prove that paper bullets are not as good as real bullets. Otherwise, only the chirping sound would be left in the world.</p>
<p>Stirring the sewage will cause some sediment to float up, raising a burst of fishy odor, often causing those who keep themselves clean to step back, and these things sway even more vigorously.</p>
<p>Regarding this: we need to be more vigorous, and we must be able to skillfully outline some faces. Good topics for short works may be found here.</p>

<h3>The Arts and Entertainment World and the Cold Clothing Movement for Refugees</h3>
<p>— Yan Ran</p>
<p>Recently, due to the increasingly cold weather, all walks of life have begun to pay attention to the issue of cold clothing for refugees. Many enthusiastic people are already actively carrying out the collection of cold clothing for refugees, so that more than 30,000 refugees stranded on isolated islands can survive this cold winter. This kind of work is really worthy of admiration and respect.</p>
<p>The arts and entertainment world is the vanguard of the times, and its every move can give the audience a deep impression. For this reason, we sincerely hope that the authorities of the arts and entertainment world and the general practitioners will give great help to the collection of cold clothing for refugees, so that this serious issue of cold clothing for refugees can be resolved satisfactorily.</p>
<p>To promote the cold clothing movement for refugees, performers should first do their best to persuade their families and friends to participate. In addition, in their work, they should make full use of opportunities to insert the plight of the refugees who are displaced and the sorrow of having no clothes to keep warm. Use sincere words and moving expressions to stir the hearts of every audience member, so that they can automatically participate in this great cold clothing movement for refugees. Only in this way can the responsibilities of the performers be fulfilled, and only then will the arts and entertainment world make a great contribution to helping the refugees.</p>
<h3>The French Film Industry After the European War</h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Before and after the outbreak of the European War, although the entertainment industry in France was greatly affected, the film industry flourished instead. There are now many new film producers, directors, and actors in Paris. Among them are those from Germany, England, Italy, Belgium, the Soviet Union, and those who have returned directly from Hollywood. Male stars such as Charles Boyer and female stars such as Danielle Darrieux are working together to overcome national difficulties and serve the film industry of their motherland.</p>
<p>The composition of film producers in Paris is complicated. Based on their financial resources, each person can produce an average of two films per year. Those with strong financial resources are the so-called "Cine-Alliance," hosted by the Russian Rasseville, which can produce six films per year. The four famous actresses in Paris, such as Simone Simon, are recruited by him. At present, they are filming tragic and慷慨 films, such as "The Iron Flow of the North Country," "Anti-Japanese Warriors," "Volunteer Ship," "Vast Blue Sky," and "Paris Under the Storm."</p>
<p>Since countries such as Germany, Italy, and Spain implemented dictatorship, their film industries have been very depressed, and the film market is centered in Paris. Film studios are working day and night. Various products are exported to Canada, Central America, South America, and the Far East, and can be parallel to American films and are equally welcomed by audiences. But once they are imported into the United States, there is a feeling of small witch meeting big witch.</p>
<p>American film producers treat French films with the purpose of "having an adopted son," meaning that they can only be used as occasional exhibits and are difficult to perform regularly. Parisian film producers of course feel resentful. Recently, in view of the fact that American movie fans welcome French films, as a retaliatory measure, the copyright of each film only needs 5,000 US dollars to be transported to other countries. If American theaters want to rent and show them, each film must cost 50,000 US dollars.</p>
<p>The average profit of French films is 20,000 US dollars per film. The annual income of several red stars ranges from 12,000 to 30,000 US dollars. The highest record for production cost is 170,000 US dollars. This is only one-tenth of the economic power of Hollywood. However, because of their continuous efforts, their achievements have been advancing rapidly, and Hollywood's products are being excluded from the Paris market year by year.</p>

<h3>"Confucius" will be on the screen The Minhua Film Company is producing it Directed by Fei Mu and starring Zhang Yi</h3>
<p>Minhua Company is jointly established by Tong Zhenmin and Jin Xinmin, who are ambitious in the film industry. Both of them are very energetic young people. When "Song of the Fishermen" was premiered, it was discovered in the newspapers that an unknown source of free large-scale advertisements was sent and published by Jin Jun, and he even watched the film as many as a dozen or twenty times. His devotion to the film industry can be seen in general.</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, Fei Mu, and Jin Tong were old friends, and the idea of ​​cooperating to make a film had been brewing for a long time. It was not until recently that Minhua Company was formed and it was decided to make "Confucius". The script is roughly ready, and the details are still under detailed discussion, because the handling of Confucius' deeds is actually more difficult than other historical figures.</p>
<p>Although "Confucius" is starring Zhang Yi, Zhang is not playing Confucius, but Zilu, a son known for his bravery. As for the actor for the role of Confucius, the selection is still in progress. Other actors can be announced recently. The photography work has been hired by the famous photographer Zhou Daming, and will be produced at the Lianhua General Factory, which has been renamed Hualian.</p>
<p>Fei Kang, a professor at Guangxi University who stayed in Shanghai due to inconvenient transportation, also participated in the work. Fei is not only well-versed in Chinese studies, but also a construction expert. He will also make special contributions to the textual research and design of set props and costumes.</p>
<p>The deeds of "Confucius" took place 2,400 years ago, which is completely different from the themes of romances and is more suitable for making movies. Therefore, Fei Mu has collected a large number of reference books and is engaged in discussing the script with many experts in Chinese studies. It is expected that the production work will begin next month.</p>
<h3>About "Women"</h3>
<p>— Xin Fang</p>
<p>MGM's big production of the year, "The Women," has now been completed and will soon be shown at the newly built Dahua Cinema in this city. The film is entirely starred by female stars, and the details have been recorded in this magazine.</p>
<p>Joan Crawford has a bathing scene in the film. Director George Cukor personally guides her various bathing actions. The MGM company authorities specially made a crystal bathtub for it. In short, the money spent on shooting this scene was very huge.</p>
<h3>Recent Events of Shirley Temple</h3>
<p>— Cheng Zeng</p>
<p>Although some people say that Shirley Temple's performance is too unnatural for a child and too contrived. However, anyone who has seen her work cannot deny that she is a very smart and lively child star, and she is very good at acting. Regarding her recent situation, let me tell you a little bit:</p>
<p>Likes to do housework</p>
<p>Shirley is very interested in doing housework. This is the materialism she has recently experienced. Setting the table, hanging curtains. When her mother is cooking in the kitchen, she often asks about cooking methods, and sometimes even moves the spatula herself.</p>
<p>A new change</p>
<p>Although Shirley is a natural actress, she has always been dominated by her work. Recently, however, he understands that work is a skill, and he has his own opinions to participate in every scene he shoots. After watching a set or plot, she might say, "No, that's not right!"</p>
<p>Implementing diet to lose weight</p>
<p>Her body has been getting fatter day by day recently. Everyone is worried that she will become too fat to be suitable for the screen, so recently, after a doctor's examination, she is implementing a diet to lose weight, which is a very painful thing for Shirley. Because of this, she can no longer eat sweets freely. Someone has forbidden her to eat too much sugar. Except on Sundays or holidays, she can no longer eat chocolate candy.</p>
<p>Going to visit England</p>
<p>He will soon go to England for a visit, because Queen Mary of England has been longing for her presence for a long time. Two major theaters in London have begun to arrange Miss Shirley's public speeches and performances. It is expected that the people of London will be able to feast their eyes and cause a sensation in the nine cities.</p>
<p>Chess Garden Edited by Bao Zibo, Proofread by Cheng Zhu</p>
<p>Next issue's moves will be revealed</p>
<p>Chess News The Xiangqi Team Championship, sponsored by the Jingwu Sports Association, has been divided into two groups, A and B, due to the enthusiastic participation of teams.

<h3>The Gold and Silver Issue in the Wulongyuan Play</h3>
<p>Moreover, if it really weighed dozens of taels, Song Jiang's letter would definitely not have been lost. The reason for this is that when he was vigorously pulling the door, the big silver ingot under his armpit fell on the floor with a thud. it would definitely not have failed to wake Posxi and make Song Jiang unaware. If we take a step back and say that the silver ingot was less than fifty taels, or even only ten or two taels, then Chao Tianwang would become a poor bandit leader. If Song Sanye was willing to accept his small gift, it would show that he was also an incompetent and ignorant person.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, I talked about a certain red corner's "Thirteenth Sister", with the intention of admonishing the already famous actors not to be clever and change the lyrics or acting arbitrarily, so as not to mislead future students. Dezhu is originally known for her martial arts, but she is determined to be a flower actress. She is probably not suitable for the Zheng Gong Qingyi opera, so this time she still knows how to hide her clumsiness. A careful examination of her "Making a Scene in the Courtyard to Kill Posxi" reads as if she is imitating Cuihua's style. Xiao Cui's flower actress can certainly dominate the north and south today, but also because she is too self-conscious, she sometimes changes the old rules; moreover, because most flower actress plays are in Beijing dialect, she often mixes in Beijing slang and various "jokes" in the play, which is not easy for non-old Beijingers to understand. If you understand the jokes, it is indeed very interesting. For example, the teacher's words in "Fighting the Fisherman and Killing the Family" such as "The mouse licking the cat's nasal bone" (I'm dead) "Picking chicken feathers on the road" (Making a duster), are all "xiehouyu" spoken by people in the Jianghu or lower society. Probably only the first half of the sentence is said, and the second half is not said, and people understand it. (135)</p>
