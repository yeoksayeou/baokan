<h3>世局之轉機</h3>
<p>卓然爲世界的大政治家者：於所憑藉，則內審國情，外察世變，高瞻遠矚，灼見眞知；於所作爲，則擒縱時機，斟酌剛柔，獨往獨來，能發能收；而後可措國族於磐石之安，張國勢於昌隆之境；彼英法德義美俄，並爲當世六强，非偶然也。曩嘗謂日本現在無大政治家，溯念當年，敗淸取韓，聯英却俄，戰無不勝而卒放棄遼東，則明治天皇以决，自有其不可及者焉，然而逝矣。及徼倖於九一八之，收穫，遂自絕於李頓之報告，當時舉世莫敢櫻日本黷武之鋒，亦絕少同情中國於久亂之後，若適可而止，埋頭經營，則今日日本之國際地位，正未可想象。顧乃以無饜之欲念，瘋在之情緒，馴至國策失其重心，進止喪其理智；旣不自知暴力之不足以兼併中國，復不知中國民氣與潛力之足以持久周旋；及遭堅强抵抗，未能知難而退；雖有德國之忠告，其他諸國之規勸，未能幡然改圖；及今國際已陷孤立，種種壓力將循序而至，百萬壯丁傷亡前綫，百萬萬物力化爲烟火，精已疲，力已盡，崩潰不遠矣。彼果有大政治家者，即使不克勒馬懸崖於往昔，亦應及時回頭於今茲；但看彼議會中朝野相處，固猶爲卑怯也，虛僞也，炎炎大言以欺民欺世也。以此視歐洲動盪中之各國政家言行動中肯綮者，幾何不論斷於東方西方黃種白種之懸殊耶！</p>
<p>本報日前並論德國元首希特勒，英國首相張伯倫，美國總統羅斯福三氏之言論；嘗謂今後國際之重要行動，將與此言論有密切關係；而國際論壇，舉世視聽，則保留其悲觀或樂觀，以俟本月四日，義國首相墨索里尼氏在法西斯蒂最高會議之演辭。即如英國政府，亦靜觀此日演辭，以决定英義經濟談話之進行或吾。誠以當今國際爭議之焦點，對立之最尖銳者，莫過於法義兩國；義國居於問題之主動，首相墨索里尼氏允主動之魂靈也。墨氏而作强硬表示，提出法國所不能接受之條件。則希特勒張伯倫羅斯福三氏之苦心孤詣，悉成幻夢，而終必不免於血染歐羅巴，驅千百萬生命於火坑，舉文明財富，悉付一炬。乃消息傳來，法西斯蒂最高會議迄午夜散會，首相主席致辭，內容秘不發表。惟不發表，故無自而知其內容；所可推想而知者，對內致辭，對黨致辭，非對國際說話；若對國際，則惟恐傳之不速不廣，斷無秘不發表之理。國際危機在此，舉世視聽在此，而墨氏深沉如彼，是非有其眞知灼見而能發能收者歟？世界的大政治家之非常手腕，非常機變，洵不可以恒情相衡；而其灑脫活潑之作風，以視日本「推車碰壁」而儘推，以不推爲「丟臉」者，何其高哉！</p>
<p>抑前夜義相墨氏之不向國際說話，當然並非自此安於緘默，自此放棄其對於國際之願望，更不容推論於世界危機之自此消逝。蓋說話之機會，隨時可致；國族之願望，淵源有自；而西班牙國民軍全勝之日，義大利志願兵撒退之前，願望允易昂進”說話允易激越；是前途果將如何趨歸，殊未可知也。雖然，得此說話展緩之時間，便有外交運用之空間；而感情之儘量抑制，即理智之儘量伸張；以外交之運用，理智之伸張，則合情合理之願望自易取償之以和平途徑。况大局經此美妙之頓挫，一般人士俱將轉變其印象曰：全能國家非必黷武國家。祗此印象之轉變，亦必能於義國合理之願望，加以更善意之考慮；試徵之最近將來之國際輿情，必將翕然於義相墨氏之持重，而英相張氏之將作友好斡旋，又必不惟所謂英義經濟談話之進行而已；是可逆覩者也。</p>

<h3>愛情與結婚的年齡大有關係</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學畢業楊道南醫師著</p>
<p>要研究夫婦之愛，則雙方結婚的年齡必須加以注意，照生理學上講，結婚適當的年齡，須在男女雙方心身俱達於成熟期，判斷力和品性已經十分發達的時候，換句話說，就是男子到二十三四歲至二十六七歲，女子二十歲到二十三四歲爲正當的結婚年齡，過早和過遲，都是有損而無益的。</p>
<p>結婚過早，非但害一己之一康健，促個人的壽命，並且貽一禍於子孫，女子出嫁過早，花一容月貌，容易變爲衰老，不能全其天年，男子結婚過早，體力衰退，性力易損，且有的男子，因結婚過早而把生殖器的發育摧殘，每都患不能生育症，即使生育，子女百分之百羸弱。</p>
<p>還有結婚的年齡與夫婦的愛情，又有重大的關係，爲什麼呢？因爲伉儷間的愛情是從健康生活中開發而來，婚後的幸福則必須性力健全，方可享受。</p>
<p>在現代這匆忙煩複的生活裹，往往使吾人的精力渙散，未老先衰，對於夫婦間愛情的開發，無力顧及，所以容易增速男人的性潮反應，而女子的性潮反應却變爲遲鈍，這無形在男女愛情之中間，劃成了一條鴻溝，要塡平這條鴻溝，祗有從增精補血着手，積極增進靑春腺的繁榮，雖年齡已增，並可藉此返老還童，重度靑春健康之樂，因爲靑春腺强壯之後。此種男女間性潮參差的缺陷。即可變爲協調。</p>
<p>照醫學而論，一個人的精力所以强盛的緣故，無非山於靑春腺的繁榮，故如能使此靑春腺保持健全，則一切均有辦法，患者如自知有此種缺陷，卽可服以睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」，該劑在最近時間之內，卽生精補腎：任何衰弱毛病或發育不全者均可治愈，丈夫服後，能使妻子的愛情纏綿，魚水之樂，勝於新婚。且「補體康」歷經各國醫家多方實驗，證明爲治療性弱最優良製劑。婦女體衰月經不調可服女用「補體康」</p>
<h3>介紹治肺良藥</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>余以二十六七年來之肺病臨床上之實驗，「補肺拿爾」一藥，確可稱爲肺病聖劑，因其成分純粹，以補肺治癆爲目標。故不論若何難以根本治愈之咳嗽，服三小時後，卽可鎭咳化痰，神驗無比。旣能將咳嗽于短期內治愈。復可將危險萬分之肺癆，完全治愈。由余精密之統計，對於咳嗽病之由流行性感冒及肺加答兒等而來者，惟有服「補肺拿爾」，始可短期根治。如服他藥，未有不纏綿而變成痼疾者。</p>
<h3>淋病講座</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所：寧波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>多發性的攝護腺炎</p>
<p>斬絕病根　免其多變</p>
<p>凡是淋病轉入慢性，其變症必多，吾人治療時，切勿捨本逐來，必須斬絕病根，才可望其永不再發。惟一般病家，不此之圖，反而作頭痛醫頭，脚痛醫脚之舉，市上成藥亦應時而起，如雨後春筍，方興來艾。而淋病反見曼延，其故何歟？蓋卽余上文指出不知根本解决淋毒之根株，而只是浮光掠影，爭取表面上一點功效，以博病家之信仰也。就中以淋病症狀中之攝護腺炎，最多反覆變幻，許多淋毒性攝護腺炎，一過急性，對於自覺症漸付缺如，故病家亦不感到有何痛苦，而多淡然處之，但一經勞動或房事之餘，卽行重發，更有許多淋菌，雖行攝護腺按摩，亦檢不出有何淋菌，蓋淋菌深入腺體之內部，不能用按摩之法，迫之使出也。</p>
<p>乘機搗亂　疑鬼疑神</p>
<p>旣然淋菌不能用一般手術可以逼之使出，則淋菌往往出來乘機搗亂，使人疑鬼疑神，不明究竟，亂投針藥，更不易制伏淋菌。余恒以顯微鏡及其他方法檢出病情後，即用德國靜電療法與X線電療法其電熱威力，能透射攝護腺諸小腺，更投以淋病聖藥「克淋儂」作爲內服劑，以抗淋噬菌，則奏效更大，每能短期治愈，杜其再發之根　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自卽日起每天送診二十號，每號僅取號金五角</p>

<h3>淋病之危機及挽救</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>白濁重在根治　變症允須兼顧，</p>
<p>國際醫學年會　指明治療正軌！</p>
<p>淋病的猖獗，實在與經濟學上有關，所以不景氣之在潮，捲沒了整個的地面，當人們麪包正發生恐慌的時候，誰還有能力來贍養妻子呢？所以在資本主義的制度下？人類深深地感到經濟恐慌的威脅，結婚只能讓有錢階級所享有，一些廣大貧苦羣衆，或小市民階級，對於結婚，只能認爲是一種特殊的權利了。</p>
<p>但生理上有錢階級中人，並不異樣，他們一樣要求異性的安慰。所以宿娼就成爲社會上一種普遍的現象，由宿娼而引起的淋病，也就無怪其日見流行起來了。根據著名學者之研究，患梅病的人不論男女，他們第一可怕之危機，便是骨膜和關節炎，這常會使四肢殘廢，腰背佝僂，其次淋毒更進一步而入骨髓，那就有頃刻暴斃之虞！尤其是由此引起腦脊髓膜炎，異常險惡。關於淋病的治療，據國際最著名之淋病專家柯路漫氏於一九三二年曾有一篇馳譽世界的論文發表，題爲「提供一個淋病的特殊療法」，除述淋病必須服用「克淋儂」外，並指出「克淋儂」乃德國彼德博士根據非特異療法，用蛋白體黃色素混合製成，共殺菌抗淋力，可達到細胞之全部，故彌漫性之全身淋毒傳染，關節炎等，非「克淋儂」不足以征服之，因之其他一切新舊白濁，均有待「克淋儂」之治療，始可根治，而各國臨床家對於淋病之用「克淋儂」，巳成普遍之現象矣！余自由美返國以還，以「克淋儂」治愈淋病者，何翅千萬，而其他落伍之市上成藥之不敵「克淋儂」者，完全是由於本劑功效卓特之故。</p>
<h3>治療遺精應注意的幾點</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>欲使遺精得治，除藥劑療法之外，尚須注意下列的幾點</p>
<p>早晨醒覺時，卽須離床，切勿遲遲不起。　就寢之前須行室內外運轉五分鐘，以疲癆其筋骨，使易入睡鄉。　劇場舞塲及遊藝塲男女混雜之處，宜少涉足，　靑年婦女，宜少接見。　不可談男女間瑣事。　不可閱誨淫小說，宜談偉人傳記，及修養道德之書。　暇時宜運動及作郊外遊，以呼吸新鮮空氣。　睡時宜側眠屈膝。故衛生家云：「睡側而屈，覺正而伸，此法不僅止遺，亦養生妙法也」。　中夜如有尿急，宜起而排洩之，吾則膀胱尿滿，壓迫精囊，易起遺精。　被褥不可過軟，但宜適中。　　禁食烟，酒等刺激品，然後服以遺精專藥「耐而斯遺精片」以止遺精，卽可制止，如兼服德國內分泌專家梅倫博士所發明的眞正雄壯動物睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」效果愈佳。此在臨床上，久已證明。</p>

<h3>日方攫奪華中經濟全貌</h3>
<p>— 顧孝慧</p>
<p>日本現在華中佔領區域內，積極進行經濟侵略工作，組織所謂華中振興株式會社」，以「一業一公司」爲對象，成立各種子公司，對華中無論農產。擴產。工業。交通。電氣。等事業，加以壟斷，圖在對華方面，攫奪戰區內整個經濟權力；對外方面，在擯險國際在華的利益；對它們自己，則在壓搾民間經濟，推展到中國來，總之一句，凝在榨取佔領區內的經濟，以補日本財政上的缺陷，而謀遂行其對華長期戰爭，並將在中國的日軍給養，完全耍出諸中國人的身上，這可於最近板垣答復議員的言辭中見之。</p>
<p>筆者現將日方在華中經濟侵略的方式，各種侵略機關的組織，和華中各業被佔情形，根據記者調查所得，和中英日文報紙的記載，寫下這一篇東西，讓大家看看日方經濟侵略華中的來龍去脈，要使我國人知道這種强占硬覇的行動，我們只要不點頭，無論他怎樣，終有光復舊物之一日。</p>
<p>一·所謂「華中振興公司」（？）</p>
<p>在東三省，我們曉得日本曾有着一個所謂滿鐵會社」，日本人自己說它是侵大陸的急先鋒。一九一八以後，幾年來關外的各種經濟權，全已占在它的手中。八一三以後，日本又以這一種政策，在去年十一月七日，成立了兩個新的會社，一個是對華北的所謂「華北發展株式會社」，一個即是對華中的所謂「華中振興株式會社」，這兩個組織，和滿鐵一樣是日政府認爲的「國策公司」。本文所說的單就「華中振興公司」去說。</p>
<p>該「華中振興公司」，是根據日政府去年四月二十八日第七十三屆日本國會通過而設立的。去年十一月七日在東京成立以後，總公司據說設於上海，（但尚未見實現），該公司的資本爲一億日圓，由日本政府及民間各負半數凑成，其第一次收入股本爲三千一百三十八萬二千三百四十四圓。其中分：</p>
<p>日本政府——八，八八二，三四四日圓</p>
<p>實物折合—七，六四〇，〇〇○日圓</p>
<p>現金——一一，二四二，三一四四日圓</p>
<p>民間股分——一二，五〇〇，〇〇〇日圓</p>
<p>但是說也可憐，這民間資金，是經過了四個月的長時期，分做十萬股，募得而來，參加的股東，達九千七百七十人之多，而出的錢，也祗有一千二百多萬。</p>
<p>該公司的組織，除了許多子公司以外，分三課一所，如下：</p>
<p>上海總社</p>
<p>子公司　總務課　商務課　業務調查課　東京分所</p>
<p>重要的負責人，總裁係由日政府任命，爲兒玉謙决，這老頭，就是戰前所謂中日貿易協會的日方會長，我們總還記得幾年前到上海來在國際飯店杯酒聯歡，高唱中日經濟合作的事情吧！現在的狐狸尾巴顯出來，原來所謂「合作」是這樣的合作，凡是迷着做中日經濟合作夢的人們，也應該覺醒了。如今且將這公司各重要的負責人列下：</p>
<p>總裁　兒玉謙次　（前正金銀行總經理）</p>
<p>副總裁　平澤要　（前遞信省次官）</p>
<p>理事　金井清（前滿鐵會社專員）</p>
<p>園田三郎（前正金銀行外國課）</p>
<p>油谷恭　（前中日實業協會理事）</p>
<p>該公司的成立，上面已經說過，實際是一個壓搾日本民資，和代表日政府經濟侵華的總機關，而由其所屬的子公司實施侵略。子公司的設立，爲一業一公司，無論何業，都由道一業的公司去統制，其目的是要把住整個的華中工商業樞紐，排斥歐美在華的利益，使中國成爲它經濟的附庸，有如古代的農奴。永遠不能踏進現代工業的門徑。</p>
<p>關於子公司控制各業的詳情，寫在後面，現在再來說該公司主腦兒玉謙次的活動。</p>
<p>兒玉謙次於該「華中振興公司」成立後，在東京曾對路透社記者發表談話，欲誘致英美在它的控制區域內去投資，因此吾認統制和獨佔，第一，兒玉說「該公司不受陸軍的支配，係完全商業性質，」這一句全是謊話，明明是日本對華的「國策公司」之一，兒玉自己是由日政府任命的，據東京方面自己所說，日政府對該公司之監督權，有取銷該會社决議之權，有委任及解除該會社負責人之權，並在國防或其他必要上，得頒發各種必耍命令云云，於此足見兒玉所說全係假話，實際這公司是日政府的代表，裹面的負責人，是軍閥的走卒。第二，它說「該公司未有壟斷之意，」更完全是哄人瞎說，遠看「滿鐵」一在東北，到現在已完全排斥整個國際利權於「滿洲」，近看華北，棉花的統制，名義上是僞組織，實際上還不是這所謂「華北開發公司。」再如在上海與內河的航路，自日本的「內河輪船公司」成立以來，就被完全壟斷。「內河輪船公司」，即是這公司的子公司，外商航輪果也曾向日方交涉通行證，航行內河而不可得，共他各業正多着，難道還不足證明他的統制嗎？同時日方報紙，無不承認此後以統制中國工商事業爲中心的政策的。第二，兒玉又說，「上海繁榮多了，日人商業隨之發達，而外人商業亦未有獨不擴張之理，」這就是它們企圖引誘歐美來華中投資，完成它的發展陰謀。但是各方對兒玉的談話，都漠然置之，它就在如此狀况下離開東京到上海來活動了。</p>
<p>兒玉於去年十一月二十六日乘宮崎丸到上海，同時偕來的，有該公司副總裁平　，及理事等，曾在虹口與偽方舉行所謂偽日經濟合作辦法，包括。</p>
<p>擴展振與公司的方策；</p>
<p>設立日華銀行。</p>
<p>發行僞鈔。</p>
<p>推行軍用票。</p>
<p>其他統制事宜。</p>
<p>十一月三十日由滬去南京，與日軍最高指揮商討協作辦法；並在南京召集江蘇，浙江，安徽三省僞省長開會，商談它們所謂的「合作一辦法，實際上是呌幾個傀儡來詢問一聲，你那裹有什麼東西可供攫奪罷了！兒玉據說是長川住於上海，但是它希圖設立日華銀行，和發行偽鈔的計劃，因中外各銀行的正義拒絕，它的計劃是失敗了。推行軍用票呢，在它到了南京之後，已經與日方商妥，已於去年十一月三十日起實行，那即是在佔據區發行新軍用票，代替銀行鈔票的以廢紙購買貨物於攫奪政策。</p>
<p>三·各種統制公司的設立</p>
<p>關於日方統制各業，所設立的各種子公司，在「華中振興公司」尚未成立以前，和兒玉未來上海以前，已經在日軍的「囑托」設立了不少的公司，後來「振興公司」成立了，各公司就是它的子公司了，兒玉來華以後，又新成立了好幾個。</p>

<p>其計劃第一期盜採南京與蕪湖間，太平與銅陵間之桃冲鐵鑛區，尤以太平鐵鑛，為預備暈先開採的目標。第一年度計劃採掘鐵一百萬噸，已在在凹凸山與南山兩地實行開採，現在日平均掘鐵五百噸，在去年十月二十六日從馬鞍山運出第一船七千噸，三十一日運出第二船三千噸，十一月日運第三船皆往日本。</p>
<p>在華中佔領區，開辦長途汽車，於去年十一月五日成立「華中都市公共汽車股份有限公司」，總公司設於上海，資本三百萬日圓，內由興中公司，大直汽車公司，江南產業公司等合出二百五十萬，先繳半數，餘五十萬，以所攫華方實物充足。</p>

<p>統制華中蠶種。蠶絲。絲廠的農工業，設立「華中蠶絲股份有限公司」，總公司設上海，去年八月十日成立，資本八百萬日圓，（日方有傳爲一千萬日圓的，反正都是吹牛，不管他）內由「華中振興公司」出六百萬，先繳半數，以攫取華中絲廠產業，估計爲二百萬日圓充足。</p>
<p>該公司的企圖：</p>
<p>經營機器繅絲事業。　經營蠶種的製造及分配。　經營蠶絲手繅工業。　賣買土絲。　進行與上項相關之事務。同時僞「維新政府」「責長」王子惠，前東渡時，曾將上海。無錫。蘇州。杭州。湖州。嘉興。海寗。德淸。等地的絲廠，出賣與日方，並與日農林省訂立了他們一想如意的條件：</p>
<p>（甲）華中繭子生產，須提高至開戰前一年的平準，繅絲盆數目，增至一〇，〇〇〇左右爲限。（乙）絲繭之繅製與分配，由『華中蠶絲公司』管理之。（丙）日本絲廠，專門繅製二〇至廿二，及十三至十五之較優等絲，中國絲廠，專製二十至廿二的粗絲。（丁）選擇特種絲繭，供華北及日本之用。（戊）華北生絲出口的檢騐與統制，由『華中振興公司』辦理。</p>
<p>（己）手繅絲應予鼓勵，同時並設法推廣絲繭的新用途，將來另設公司，管理特種繭干的生產。（庚）山東蠶絲工業，採與華中同一政策</p>
<p>去年十二月二十八日，成立「華中自來火株式會社」，總公司設上海資本三百萬元，內由「華中振興公司」，上海恒產公司，廣島自來火株式會社，東京瓦斯化學工業社等，出二百五十萬元，先交四分之一，以攫奪　方產業，折合爲五十萬元，充其餘股份。該公司主持人物：常務董事爲豐島愛明（前廣島自來火電軌株式會社董事），董事陳紹嬀（上海恒產公司常務董事），石倉已吉（前東京瓦斯化學工業株式會社常務董事），監事斐鳴玉。</p>
<p>統制長江航業，設立「揚子江輪船公司」，於去年十二月十日創立，總公司設上海，迄未營業，資本若干不明，由「華中振興公司一及日淸輪公司，大運汽船公司等投資，並攫奪揚子江沿岸華方輪公司碼頭等充當資本，以壟斷長江各口岸全部航業，置有江輪十六艘，排斥英國航業。</p>

<p>攫奪江浙沿海魚產，設立「華中水產株式會社」，於去年十一月六日成立，總公司設上海，資本一百三十三萬日元，內由一華中振興公司」出一百萬其餘三十三萬以攫奪上海漁市塲產業等，折合充之，該公司以經營水產物之批發市塲，與販賣事業，並從事漁輪與網漁等的捉捕，以及冷藏運輸等的事業。</p>
<p>去年七月二十五日，成立「上海魚市塲組合」資本十萬元，與「華中水產株式會社」爲二位一體，壟斷本埠魚業。</p>
<p>至於其他在華中方面已被控制，而尚未有成立機關的，有如　鐵道，京滬，滬杭，蘇嘉，江南等鐵路，由日本軍用鐵道科，及日本鐵道部，滿鐵會社等所派的工程師修復中，將由「華中振興公司」營業。　煤礦，圖採淮南煤礦，長興煤礦等，中興煤已被開始運日。　無綫電廣播事業，已成立有「大上海」，「大東」，圖利用僞組織統制上海華商電台。　烟草有東洋葉烟葉會社，東亞烟草公司，共盛烟公司等，攫奪華商捲烟廠。　農產方面，均被在內地設立機關，統制收買，如棉花，由日商在華紗廠協會聯合會與漢奸機關市民協會，在上海設立統制機關，並向日軍部領取採辦證後，即派員在各縣設立辦事處，統制收買，禁止「私買賣」，各華商紗廠在內地所設的收花處，均已被迫撤退。如米，在松江，無錫，常熟，蘇州，等處收買，裝運出口，已不下數百萬担。　造船業日方三菱重工業公司，攫奪海軍部江南造船所修理軍艦，又占用三北鴻昌合興等三廠的機件。日軍占領了浦東老公茂定海橋大中華兩廠，日淸占用了財利龍昌恒昌祥鴻祥興招商內河等五廠機器。　水泥，紡織，麵粉等，均被日方在日軍策動下分別攫奪。</p>
<p>四，與日商公司的聯擊</p>
<p>上面所述的各子公司，這是直接對華攫奪的機關，牠們聽命於這「國策公司」的「華中振興公司」，各子公司的組織，「華中振興公司」是代表日官方的，當然參加分子，其餘是集合日商共同組織而成，以攫奪的華方產業，供其榨取，這些上面已經說過，現爲明瞭起見，再作一表在下面：</p>
<p>五，被攫奪的各種產業</p>
<p>戰前，在華中的華商紗廠，的有紡錠一百三十八萬錘，布機一萬四千七百台，目前已被日方佔據利用者，的有錠子六十萬錘，布機五千三百台，工廠共有三十七家，</p>
<p>水泥廠的被攫奪者，根據申報商業新聞所載，全國十家華商水泥廠，今僅留一家在華商手中，在日方佔領區內的九家，已全被攫取，其中在華北有三家，在華南有二家，華中方面有四家。</p>
<p>華中為蠶絲產地，日方覬覦染指已久，過去於求之不得之下，曾屢以劣質蠶種銷售與我國，圖加以危害。八一三後，在華中日軍佔領區域內的絲繭產區，如上海，無錫，杭州，蘇州，嘉興，湖州，海寗，德淸等地的絲廠，盡被佔據，自所謂華中蠶絲公司」成立後，全部皆由其侵佔經營，絲車的遭受佔據者，上海三家，絲車七百零八部，無錫九家，絲車二千五百五十四部，蘇州十九家，絲車三千六百五十六部，杭嘉湖海寗等二十二家，絲車四千零三十部。達一萬零九百四十八部，都五十餘家。</p>
<p>同時「華中蠶絲公司」並佔據繭行及蠶種製造塲，在江蘇省淪陷區內者，計有二百十四家，其中吳縣二十六所，無錫九十九所，常熟一所，吳江二所，崑山一所，太倉一所，江陰十九所，武進二十所，宜興八所，金壇三所，丹陽十所，溧陽十所，溧水一所，丹徒一所，句容二所，揚中五所，江都二所。</p>
<p>華中麵粉廠的遭受日方侵佔開工者，上海市區有福新第三廠等四家，被日方三井及三菱合辦的「日本製粉會社」所侵佔經營。無錫有福新，茂新，廣豐，廣動，九豐等五家，其中九豐一家，由日商吉田號佔營外，餘大都爲「日本製粉會社」佔營，南京有揚子江麵粉廠，被日人佐籐貢一所佔營。</p>
<p>華中游擊區內的捲烟市塲，已完全爲日方所操縱，它藉軍事勢力，禁止華商捲烟，及英商捲烟運入內地、，而以由皖省方面攏斷得來的烟草，和攫奪佔領區內的華商捲烟廠，霸佔開工，父不須繳納統稅，粗製濫造的劣貨，向內地傾銷，於此市塲盡被佔據。</p>
<p>在上海南市。浦東。閘北。楊樹浦等處的造紙廠，原有十餘家，自華軍西撒以後，工廠大都被日方佔據，旋日方企圖利誘各該廠當局與日方合作，開工復業，但各廠方面，均以大義所在，决不惜犧牲小我，一致拒絕，日方見利誘未着，乃覇佔全部廠屋機器，準備開工。</p>
<p>此外尚有被日方所覇占的工廠，已見本報商業新聞「中國工商業一篇傷心史」（見上年十　月二十七日本報）中，並有許多工廠來函聲明並未與日方合作，完全是掠奪無疑了。</p>
<p>六，末了一點感想</p>
<p>筆者將現在幾獲的材料，把這篇東西寫完了，當然我們是看見了喏大的民挨工業，遭受掠奪，是莫可諱言的損失；我們又看見了對方的未米的陰謀，在它們所謂「華中振興公司」以內。但我們實用不到如何的恐怖，我們要看它是吾食那麼能力？且看這「華中振興公司」的資本，名爲一萬萬日圓，第一期所收的僅有三千一百三十八萬二千三百四十四圓，除了日政府勉强的出了一千八百八十八萬二千三百四十四元（現金亦僅一千一百二十四萬二千三百四十四圓）以外，其餘的民股僅一千二百五十萬圓，尚且是經過了四個月的長時期，分作十萬股，而在九千七百七十個人中募得而來，這是確確實實毫無虛僞的事實，足證它們民衆對此，實是不感興趣，况且有許多事務的在華發展，對它們國內的工業非維無益，也有反而遭受到影響的，已經有發現的了。因此我們要看透了這一點，希望我各產業當局要切實履行，　硬着頭皮，忍痛犧牲到底。　决不受利誘威脅，與日僞方面合作。如此，我們看對方有何辦法，而諸君目前所被占的產業，待到最後勝利來臨之日，亦可完璧婦趙了。</p>
<p>固然，我們也曾看見過力持大義，堅拒『合作』的廠主，（這裹我要提示一個，如蘇州大隆鐵廠及蘇綸紗廠的廠主跋慶祥，它遭受日方利誘不成，加以逮捕威脅，但結果它仍是堅拒而到西南去，這是一個代表。）但我們也曾看見有甘受利用與對方合作的很多，如無錫的絲廠，即是一例。（這裏記者也舉一個例子，即全國有名的南通某紗廠，竟甘心與日方的合作下開工，它屋頂上竟飄着太陽旗和五色旗，每月以數十萬供給對方，筆者有一决去訪問該廠的眞相的時候，該廠在上海的某代表竟亦默認，據說：該廠是抵與德商的，那麼爲什麼不把他遷移呢？爲什麼要供給某方以巨款呢？那人搖搖頭笑笑，似乎表示：第一點手續太困難了，第二點因爲還想發財呀。）</p>
<p>除了以上的行動以外，還耍出以積極的行動，道我們希望於游擊區內的軍政組織了。我們耍以破壞工作，如在山西的礦產一樣，使它無法開採，道樣破壞工作並非要一定如何重大，即是要設法讓它無法開工和發掘就是了。要使對方一方面自己是沒有能力，又不能利用人家，一方面困難百出，如此，看它抓到了，又有付麼辦法？（完）</p>

<p>鼓樓拆燬　民房被拆者、指不勝計、凡某甲欲建造住房、須先與其接洽、講定價格後、彼即將某某乙之屋、拆來建造、即此所獲造孽錢、亦已頗多、民衆敢怒而不敢言、前晚深夜十二句鐘、突有西路某游擊隊員百餘人、携帶盒子砲三十尊、輕機關鎗及步鎗等械彈齊備、驟至西門吊橋堍、先由三數人上橋設有</p>

<h3>限制猶太難民來滬　領團迄無辦法　僅各電本國試勸猶人不來　本埠救濟團體經費將用罄</h3>
<p>上海泰晤十報云、去年十二月杪、公共租界工部局曾就限制歐洲難民入境問題、函致領事團、陳述意見、昨（四日）自極可靠方面探悉、領事團對此建議、已擬定答覆、日內將送交工部局、是項答覆、對於難民入境問題、未提出</p>
<p>補救辦法　而對局方之請求、除允許領事團團員將上海目前之局勢報吿其政府、並請其試勸猶太與其他難民弗來上海外、其餘各節、未經同意、聞工部局願竭其所能、以援助業已抵此之難民、但感覺如欲將來不發生嚴重後果、則上海不能再容納更多之難民、爰有致</p>
<p>函領事團　之舉、聞該函中請領事團與聞此事、俾商榷能限制、甚或阻止歐洲難民續來上海之步驟、領事團曾就此問題數度集會討論、而决定於日內正式送交工部局之答覆、聞領事團曾考慮一切有關係之因素、乃决定領事團各團員應立即將此事各自報吿</p>
<p>本國政府　陳述上海勞工與職業問題之頗為嚴重、而請政府在旅行與航行代理處用招貼與傳單等法勸令移民勿以上海為其避難地、但領事團覺舍此之外、無能為力、蓋此非易於解决之問題、德·意·法等國、固樂難民離境、對於航行公司、不能</p>
<p>悉施壓力　而使勿載難民也、駐歐中國各領事館對請領至上海之護照者、則均依照上海闢為商埠時中國與各國所訂條約辦理而簽發之、聞領事團或工部局均未致電中政府、請求訓令駐外領署停發護照、若領事團與局方决議勸請中政府發此電訓、則亦可採取此舉、至所以未作此種請求者、其故</p>
<p>顯而易見　蓋由於戰事關係、上海現無護照處、外人來滬、無庸有簽准護服之手續也、目前上海之猶太難民、局勢嚴重、預料至三月底、其數將逾四千人、其中極大部份確實赤貧如洗、約二週之後、尚有大批難民續到、但本埠猶太之救濟團體經費將罄、目下對籌募必要之款項、聞尙絕對無把握、</p>
<h3>男子一患腎病　任是靑春伴侶　難免伉儷失和</h3>

<p>歲、前充廠工、於上月十七日下</p>
<p>午、被相識之同鄕婦人張田氏（</p>

<p>路口五鳳里內東昌旅館開房間</p>
<p>、由同鄕陳兆林</p>
<p>姦宿一宵　至翌日下午</p>
<p>、始行回家、</p>
<p>而朱於女兒失蹤後、即四出找</p>
<p>尋無蹤、迨决日午後、見女歸家</p>
<p>、嚶嚶哭泣、經詢知前情、不禁</p>
<p>大駭、以女已許字與人、倘被男</p>
<p>家得悉、勢必發生糾紛、故即報</p>
<p>吿法捕房、派探將</p>
<p>田氏拘獲　解送特二法</p>

<p>據吿訴人朱福祥偕女秀英到案</p>
<p>聲訴、被田氏誘至旅館姦汚經</p>
<p>過、幷稱我當時要呌喊、强姦之</p>
<p>男子與田氏恐嚇我、如呌喊、要</p>

<h3>上海居戶注意　臘底之重要問題　並非老生常談　家主允宜一讀</h3>
<p>火燭小心　時至臘底，鄕村間饒有</p>
<p>古風，每聞擊柝而呼「</p>
<p>火燭小心」者，上海里</p>
<p>街中亦偶一遇之，其實上海之物質進步</p>
<p>，遠非鄕村之比，寒天取煖，電爐水汀</p>
<p>，「火燭小心」之警告，似已落伍，惟家</p>
<p>主夫婦終年勞動，身體上虧耗必多，若</p>
<p>不及時進補，則不僅各種舊病，恐其逢</p>
<p>春復發，卽毫無宿疾之人，亦或有精力</p>
<p>不濟，年遜一年之歎也，在此時期，子</p>
<p>之於親，婦之於夫，弟之於兄，自應用</p>
<p>火燭小心之警語，注意於身體之健康，</p>
<p>代爲購備相當之補品，如「威靈麥精魚</p>
<p>肝油」補腦，治肺，健胃强身，生精補</p>
<p>血，芳香可口，「威靈純淸魚肝油」質純</p>
<p>無腥，效力宏大，此兩種最爲合用，二</p>
<p>馬路大舞台對面正威大藥房發售，定價</p>
<p>麥精魚肝油三磅瓶一元八角，純淸魚肝</p>
<p>油大瓶二元四角，現值發行十週紀念，</p>
<p>大贈送一萬瓶，一律買一送一，允屬難</p>
<p>得之機，再或謂冬防意義，尚有注意</p>
<p>宵小降臨　以身體論之，如氣候不</p>
<p>常，易起傷風咳嗽之病</p>
<p>，此無殊盜匪入室，施</p>
<p>其刦掠手段，故俗稱風邪，此症看似輕</p>
<p>微，而影響頗鉅，如肺炎，哮喘，癆傷</p>
<p>，咯血，往往以傷風咳嗽爲誘因，則不</p>
<p>啻盜傷事主，危險孰甚，正威藥房經售</p>
<p>之「威靈複方白松糖漿」，爲最適宜於華</p>
<p>人身體之治肺良藥，遠勝其他同樣製劑</p>
<p>，每瓶定價一元，特價七角半，有病者</p>
<p>請速購買，無病者亦宜購備一瓶，蓋傷</p>
<p>風咳嗽以愈早治爲愈妙，此種「威靈複</p>
<p>方白松糖漿」，爲呼吸器病之警備隊也</p>
<p>，但日常營養，究以食牧爲主要，如胃</p>
<p>口不開，飲食少進，或吸收無力，難於</p>
<p>同化，則彷彿</p>
<p>門戶洞開　容易引盜入室，而百病</p>
<p>叢生矣，故胃病不治，</p>
<p>則營養不足，身體瘦弱</p>
<p>，雖日置珍羞，無濟於事，多服補藥亦</p>
<p>屬鞭長莫及，難竟全功，惟胃病往往不</p>
<p>易根治，久病之人，食少事煩，大以爲</p>
<p>苦，正威藥房製售一種屢試屢騐頃刻見</p>
<p>效連服斷根之「一七〇胃痛藥水」可謂開</p>
<p>胃病藥之新紀元，不論新老胃病，胃痛</p>
<p>腹脹，嘔吐便秘，見食生厭，噎氣呑酸</p>
<p>諸症，有藥到病除之妙，胃病一去，雖</p>
<p>粗茶淡飯，亦能發揮其營養力，預防疾</p>
<p>病，莫先於此，「一七〇胃痛藥水」每瓶</p>
<p>特價八角五分，此外寒天尚有一種小病</p>
<p>，宛如</p>
<p>廚房失竊　盃碟匙箸，不翼而飛，</p>
<p>爲數甚微，而臨時之不</p>
<p>便殊甚，例如吾人身體</p>
<p>暴露在外之部份，往往因寒氣侵襲，發</p>
<p>生凍瘡，痛癢難忍，潰破之後，膿血淋</p>
<p>漓，允爲可厭，正威藥房有「凍瘡如意</p>
<p>水」專治未潰凍瘡，一經搽擦，痛癢立</p>
<p>止，速日施用，腫退紅消，其已潰者另</p>
<p>有「珍珠白玉膏」搽敷創口每日一二决，</p>
<p>立見新肉生長，指日平復，患者何苦任</p>
<p>其遷延歲月，引起種種不便乎，如意水</p>
<p>每瓶定價二角五分，白玉膏每盒定價四</p>
<p>角，正威大藥房在二馬路英華街口，（</p>
<p>電話九二五二五購買不取送力）老顧客</p>
<p>均呼爲人身冬防之大本營，可謂名下無</p>
<p>處，讀者請勿認爲調言無稽。</p>

<h3>誰是瘋子</h3>
<p>— 明夫</p>
<p>似乎是章爾斯吧，會經寫過一篇小說，說有一個人跑進了盲人國，給盲人國裏的人當作盲人，爲了可憐他，救助他，一定要弄瞎他的眼睛，使他和他們一同過着健全的生活。他無法抵抗，只好逃了出來。</p>
<p>這固然是寓言，事實上未必有盲人國。然而事之所必無，却常爲理之所常有。我們却不能忽視了這樣的理。</p>
<p>我曾經參觀過瘋人院，裏面關着各等各樣的瘋人·我在走廊裹走過時，聽見他們有的在哭，有的在笑，而最普遍的則在語無倫决地呌駡。他們差不多都有同樣的話：「誰是瘋子！你們才是瘋子！我是好端端的人，爲甚關我在這裏？」</p>
<p>這也是同樣的理：明明是自己不對，却說別人不對；明明自己是瘋子，却說別人是瘋子，正如明明自己是盲人，却說別人是盲人一樣。</p>
<p>盲人洽了國，所以一定要使明眼人和他們一般盲；同樣，瘋子治了國，也就要使神志淸楚的人和他們一般瘋了。假使你不肯瘋，他就要逼害你，使你走投無路，你耍免得被他逼害死，就只有一走了事。現在，在某一個文明國裏，逃出了許多大科學家，大思想冢，怕就是這一個事理的證明吧。</p>
<p>因此，盲人國是寓言，瘋子國却竟是事實，你肯相信麼？而且瘋子國不但是世界上僅有的點綴品，竟是一而再，再而三，鼎足而立！牠們一貫的作風，就是：自己在窮兵黷武，却斥資力自防禦的人破壞和平；自己在作着種種滅絕人性的摧殘行爲，却指斥力求進化的人破壞文明；自己在擾亂秩序，却說別人不守秩序；……他們的口吻，他們的聲勢，正和我看見的那些瘋子一模一樣。</p>
<p>不過我看見的那些瘋子，人數少，勢力小，所以終於被神志淸白的人關進了瘋人院，不致出來搗亂，而這些國際間的瘋子，人數却很多，勢力已不小，世界各國神志淸白的人，若不一致團結起來，也將他們關入瘋人院裹，我怕世界的將來，就要陷入極其悲慘的命運了。</p>
<p>最近羅斯福維持和平，願爲民主國家後盾的演說，那一個神志健全的人，不認爲詞正義嚴，是足以照耀史冊的名言讜論呢？而某國的報紙却說羅斯福已經「中在」了，這正是瘋子本人駡別人瘋子的行爲，那得不使我要認某國簡直成了瘋人院，裏面養了那麼多的瘋子！</p>
<p>在瘋子的心中，也許在想，只要他們占勢力，可以獨霸世界，就可以自稱頭腦淸楚的人，而指斥別人爲瘋子。所以他們的瘋在行爲，只是有加無已，簡直要將這世界倒翻過來。然而我們知道，一八一五年，奧相梅特涅的「神聖同盟」，不也是正和今日的什麼「軸心」一樣麼？而且那時該「同盟」的勢力，還遠過於今日該軸心」。而該「同盟」究竟維持到多久呢？所謂「神聖」者，究竟成了什麼意味呢？今日該「軸心斥人爲「瘋子」，若不成爲「夫子自道」，是誰也不會相信的！勢力有甚用，瘋子還是瘋子！</p>
<p>說到這裏，誰是瘋子，似乎也就不言可喻了，我也就不必多所辭費了。不過我還聽見一個毆美很流行的笑話，不妨在此略述一下，作爲誰是瘋子這個問題的一個小參考：</p>
<p>據說希特勒有一天去參觀一個瘋人院。事前，院中的瘋子，都由執事人員費了許多苦心，敎會了「希特勒萬歲！」這個口號。希特勒一到，瘋子們排隊相迎，果然喊出了那樣可喜的口號。可是希特勒却看見一個老頭兒，並沒有喊這口號。希特勒怒洶洶地責問他：「瘋子，爲什麼不喊口號？」老頭兒却淡淡地說：「我不是瘋子；我是看門的。」</p>
<h3>讀書與寫文章</h3>
<p>— 夏服</p>
<p>——評「小說戲曲新考」</p>
<p>寫文章有方法，讀書也要有方法。這便是說：能够寫出好的文章來，必定是讀書時獲有心得。固然，專憑道聽塗說，七拉八扯地寫成一部書，硬裝上一個幌子，命名爲考證或史，在上海灘上，這類事象眞多到不勝枚舉。過去如蔣瑞藻的「小說考證」，不惟義例不淸，所抄過雜，甚至揑造出許多書名，自矜博洽。此其一例。叉如王國維「宋元戲曲史」，在編制上本來無可非議。然而他却不敢自滿，在他自己手定的「晨風閣叢書」裏，便署作「宋元戲曲考」，的確，照那本書的內容看來，這個「考」字比「史」字下得較有分寸。趙景深先生於小說及戲曲用力最勤，陸續刊印成書的有「讀曲隨筆」，「小說閒話」等作。「筆大如橡，心細如髮，在他實可當之無愧。他雖然自稱」「隨筆」，「閒話」，其實每篇文章都有極精警的見解，暗示着他細琢細磨的讀書方法。現在，他的新作「小說戲曲新考」（世界書局版，價五角）又出版了·在我個人說來，這類書籍恰投所好，讀完了，頗想說幾句話——說我自己想說的話。</p>
<p>小說部份，我所最心服的一篇，是「野叟曝言作者夏二銘年譜」。這簡直是獅子搏兎用全力，他所取的材料，幾乎都是別人所不曾留意的。然而，他却使之成爲具有眞實性的史料。他爲了一部「夏氏宗譜」，親自到過江陰，訪問過夏二銘的後裔。一篇不滿萬言的文章，竟用這種精神去幹，眞可使那些專憑耳食，不肯實際用功的人愧死。現在，「文素臣」一劇，正連上滿座，不知道大部份人是吾也曉得這位夏二銘，以及湘靈，璇姑，紅鬚客是些什麼東西。</p>
<p>「警世通言」，「醒世恒言」的來源和影響兩書，總共八十個短篇，他都一一還出它們的娘家。其所費的功夫，自非一朝一夕，這也是我所最欽折的。中國的小說史，若用他這種方法去整理，我相信一定能够更改一番面目。　　　　戲曲部份，表見他讀一部書必有一番新見解。凡硏究過雜劇傳奇的人，對這一點都應該細加考索，除非「數典忘祖地把道些東西略過不談，只知膚淺地漫談現在的皮黃劇。</p>
<p>「雍熙樂府探原」一篇，他居然替明代編書的人補正了最大的缺漏，這比單單輯上一種西廂記曲文的工作更爲實際。　　　　馬廉校注的「錄鬼簿」，原也費了不少的功夫。在趙先生明晰的眼光下，又巷馬廉補正了許多·可惜馬氏已經下世，不及看見這位同道者的丹鉛。</p>
<p>總之，這是一本極可一讀的書。假使你對小說和戲曲頗有興趣去研究，那於你的帮助更大，文筆之輕鬆流利，猶其餘事。此書最好的地方，便是公開了作者自己的讀書方法。他的目光集中在史的衍變，不曾說一句沒有證據的話。</p>
<h3>我們的空軍將士</h3>
<p>— 張美棣</p>
<p>——紀念亡友黃華林</p>
<p>當淞滬戰事最劇烈的時候，我還在南京。風聲很緊，但日機空襲，却不當作一回事，每一個人都存着一顆同樣的心，希望聽到日機被擊落的消息。京滬車時斷時通，親友信件也相當的少，偶有一二件落到我的手裏，我老是把它珍貴地去細讀；允其是德華的信，我簡直每天都盼望有她的信來。當我一天在寫字檯上發現了她的信時，我就飛速地挾着信，坐上車子，獨自溜到後湖來。</p>
<p>湖面很靜穆，沒有泛舟聲，梧桐的落葉簌簌地。鍾山也沉浸在霧的朦朧里。大地是靜悄悄的，遊人非常疏落。我坐在竹椅上，細讀德華的來信，同時，却發現隔座一位靑年，也在閱讀一封長信。</p>
<p>「同志，你可是航空人員嗎？」我發現他領章上航空署的標微，這樣冒昧發問。</p>
<p>「是的，我剛從杭州調到道兒。」他謙虛　說。</p>
<p>經過幾分鐘的接談，我們似乎很投機了。我首先對於他們保衛南京的空防錢，深致敬意。他祇淡淡地回答：「這正是我們靑年人獻身祖國的機會啊！「一句多麼有力的答語，在我耳邊掠過，我底心深深地給感動了！</p>
<p>熱忱地交談着，彼此極爲融洽，我們的友情一天深似一天，空的時候，互相過訪。他喜歡喝酒，我也酷愛杯中物，福昌飯店和國際聯歡社，老有我們二個人在座。二個月的友誼，他給我很深的印象。我知道了他的身世，他確是一個熱情而有毅力的靑年。長長的個兒，高高的鼻子，南國的風度，而性情又這樣的豪爽，却又這樣的和氣，老是把笑掛在嘴邊。穿上蔣夫人贈給的皮大衣，格外顯得英氣勃勃，誰看了都要贊聲好的。</p>
<p>黃華林，名字不很　嗎？他是中山縣人，父親是一位南洋僑商，沒有兄弟，也沒有姊妹，祇有未婚妻林小姐，還在香港大學唸書。那天後湖在看的信，正是林小姐從香島給他勉慰的信！</p>
<p>他是航校畢業生，八一三滬戰發生，他曾參與過轟炸出雲艦等諸役，頗著功績，很得長官的信任，現在是擔任首都空防。所以每當醫報在嗚以後，我們的神勇空軍就出動戒備，以翱翔空間，我老是這樣想，也許是我的好友在駕駛吧？</p>
<p>今天天空十分晴朗，我下意識料到日機一定要來空襲。果眞一刹那間，突然四週警報聲大作。今天日機分成四大隊，襲擊首都，計有七十八架。我們英勇的空軍，也大隊出動，予日機當頭痛擊。同時，高射砲和高射機關槍也佈成火網，密集放射。天空已變作火炬世界，成爲空前的奇觀。</p>
<p>「今天擊落日機十九架！」</p>
<p>當我在哥哥家裹聽到這個奏捷的消息時，太使我興奮了。我的朋友也在作戰吧！我想「先生電話，中央醫院來的，「傭人過來喊着；我突然一驚，去接了。</p>
<p>「是張先生嗎？有一位黃先生要跟你說幾句話，請趕快來！」</p>
<p>駕着車到了中央醫院。在那裏門口，一位白衣看護攔住了我。「先生是姓張罷，啊！已來遲了五分鐘，黃同志光榮地過去了！他死得眞光榮：擊落日機二架，自己身上却不幸中了好幾處的彈傷，竟還能從容把機安全降下呢。到醫院的時候，吩咐請您來看他。呀！遲了僅僅五分鐘！」她隨手交給我一張有着鋼筆字的紙條，上面道樣寥寥幾句：</p>
<p>好友們：</p>
<p>我先走了。爲了祖國，請　　　　再接再厲吧！好！珍重！努力！</p>
<p>我茫然地失去了知覺，不知在什麼時候，誰把我送回哥哥家。</p>
<p>現在呢，後湖給敵人不知蹂躏得成爲如何的一個模樣了，德華又流亡到那裏去了。但我却不想她，祇時常懷念着我那勇敢的好友：您好好的安睡吧！我永遠在記着你，讓我吿訴你：勝利的曙光已展開了。（稿酬難民）</p>
<h3>還是那麼一套。</h3>
<p>中篇小說</p>
<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>這時外面大街上忽然發出了一陣喧譁聲浪，隱的好像有許多人在嚷着：「看飛機！」『看飛機！』一時席上的談話聲寂然了，大家都側耳聽着外面。隔了一會，有幾個人忍不住，先跑到天井裏，後來索性跑到了大街上。葉團長也緩步在後跟了出來，見大街上黑壓壓的聚集着一大堆人，七嘴八舌的亂嚷，不禁暗暗的皺了皺眉，覺得他們完全沒有軍事常識，連忙高喊着說：</p>
<p>「趕快散開，不要擠在一起，當心給敵機做了目標！」</p>
<p>大家雖都注意他的軍服，但沒有一個人肯聽他的話，仍舊擠着不散。葉團長沒奈何，只好取出隨軍携帶的望遠鏡來，向空中瞭望。空中正有三架銀灰色的飛機，排成T字形飛翔着，是兩架戰鬥機保衛着一架重轟炸機，他不禁頓了頓脚說：</p>
<p>「還不趕快散開，那後面的一架是轟炸機，會扔下炸彈來的。」</p>
<p>正這樣說着時，空中的飛機忽地向下一降，開始「可可可可」的放起機關槍來，一時子彈像雨點一樣在屋頂和地面卜卜地跳，人叢中早有人喊了聲「哎唷！」仆倒在地上，爬不起來。於是，街心裏的人發了聲喊，大家一閧而散，本來在席上陪葉團長的幾位陪客，這時都慌慌張張的向公所裹亂逃。陳鎭長和葉老先生雖都沒有移動身子，但看着大家慌亂的模樣，也不禁嚇得面色慘白，沒有人色。</p>
<p>接着又是很響亮的一聲「轟隆！」　地皮劇烈地搖震了一下，席上有好幾隻酒杯被震翻了，酒流滿了地。</p>
<p>葉團長回到天井裹，看見那三架飛機，在鎮上盤旋了一周，循着太湖，冉冉的飛向西北方去。直到望不見了影子，他纔進來繞着葉老先生，向陳鎭長吿辭。</p>
<p>陳鎭長一面呌起所有的陪客，一面仍舊殷殷挽留葉老先生和葉團長等席終再走。但在這樣的悄勢下，葉老先生固然是無心久坐，就是陪客們也都驚魂不定，任是再有佳殺珍饈，也不能下咽，終於大家都同意讓這一席歡迎的盛宴，就此草草結束，恭恭敬敬的把這兩位貴客，一直送到鄉公所門口。陳鎭長口裏不住說着：</p>

<p>談話</p>
<h3>黃包車夫應該識字看報嗎？</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>二十五年前，我路過日本，看見有許多黃包車夫，在路旁拿着報紙看報。</p>
<p>上海的黃包車夫到今天有多少人能够看報呢？五六年前黃包車夫問題在上海鬧得很厲害，中外人士，大聲疾呼，爲他們課幸福；不久就有人力車夫互助會的成立。</p>
<p>互助會的工作到今天却有相當的成績，如疾病得着醫治，于弟得入學校，糾紛得以調解，生活得到改進；這不能不歸功於互助會理事諸公的努力。　　　　但關於敎育方面，尙有美中不足的地方。查該會雖有通俗演講以液輸衛生常識，有閱報室以供流覽，可惜還沒有設立學校使百分之九十以上不識字的車夫。都能識字看報。</p>
<p>黃包車夫應該識字看報，誰都不能吾認的。但有人以爲黃包車夫處境淸苦，生活艱難，終日勤勞，尙不得溫飽，那有餘閒來讀書識字呢？車夫生活艱難，我是深表同情的：車夫該是文盲，就無人表示同情了。我們一方面提高改進車夫的生活，一方面應給予車夫識字的機會。</p>
<p>這事希望互助會理事諸公負責推進。盼不久的將來，在上海路旁，也可以到處看見黃包車夫拿着報紙看報！</p>
<h3>談談難童教育（續）</h3>
<p>— 唐慶愷</p>
<p>的確難童敎育與普通的小學敎育，不同的地方，是很多的，非實踐的經騐過，是不得而知的，現在把他分別說來。　　　　關於設備方面：在簡陋內收容所裹，大多數耍找到一個適當的敎室，是困難的事情，設備上那更談不到了，沒桌有椅，難童們是站立着上課的，假使鐘點多些，很容易疲憊的，對於書法抄寫等，簡直無從練習。</p>
<p>關於舉級的編制方面：收容所的難胞是流動性的，所以人數驟多驟少，複式的，單級的敎學，尙不足應付，各級的人數相差太遠，難童的程度不齊而複雜，課本的水準不能調合，每天上課的時間支配，不能適合一般敎育的分數，的確，在收容所裏辦難童的敎育，如是特殊的敎育，沒有一定的方式來規定，是要敎師們隨機應變來支配調整應付。　　　　關於課程方面；難童在課程上與普通學校，沒有什麼大的差別，例如普通學校裹必修的國語，算術，常識，體育，音樂，圖畫，以及適合於幼稚班的游唱，講故事等，難童班亦無一不備，不過時間上速率上，不及普通小學，在惡劣環境下，如何去改善，是值得硏究的，敎材方面，除了國語，算術有課本外，其他都得敎師去找材料，作者看到有些收容所裏，專門在上國語，算術兩課，而把其他課程忽略過去，我想找材料的問題，也是一種原因，允其是常識課範圍至廣，參考書方面，應儘量供給敎師們。</p>
<p>關於實施方面：對兒童談敎育，是純粹的心裏敎育，屬於精神的灌注，對於被　的兒童們，則更不可疏忽精神敎育的作用，所以有人主張難童敎育的實施，一切以愛爲依歸，讀書識字，倒是一種决要，至於上課時間，在收容所裏，覺得在上午七時至十時，下午二時至四時最爲適宜，每天至少三小時，課外活動，也不可缺少的，大概因爲生活不安定的緣故，一般難童在敎室裏，覺得是痛苦的，無心上課，要使難童們感到興趣，那非敎師們用精神講話的方式來感化他們不可了。</p>
<p>平心而論，在收容所裹惡劣的環境下，能够積極辦起敎育來，不能不算是一種苦心。除了同悄，更希望進一步推動，把全市的難胞，健全組織起來，敎育起來，在這偉大的時代，非常的敎育，决不是爲「敎育而敎育」而是爲「救國而敎育」啊。　（完）</p>

<p>滬戰方起，袁麻子是失業了。他乘着難民救濟會的船，回到他的家鄉，旣少積蓄，叉無可種的他，焉能不感着生活恐慌呢？他很知道「坐吃山也空」的陳語，找事嗎，在此軍與時候，失業日增之際，更不容易了。祇得憑他　來的忠實，借點資本，在郵政局門口設攤售賣香烟，洋火，肥皂，之類的日用品，暫以餬口，而免飢餓。戰事西移，家鄉頓變成江南人避難的樂土，類此攤販，因之增多。致袁麻子營業减色，不由的使他日感拮据。但他不因此而消極，另想生財之道，他定購一兩份上海申報，及鄰縣日報，創設所謂「露天閱報處」，取費四枚。他的宜言是「化少許錢可讀數種報紙」一般欲明戰事情形者，到有很多人來看，可是申報有時因郵中斷，又使他的「露天閱報處」　夭折。他又深知在此商戰時代，物品是要新奇的，或帶點投機性，方不致淘汰。他眼見着時疫流行，乃售應時的藥品。秋冬之際，他又改賣兒童所需的文具，蛤油，凍瘡油，並以他在滬常看廣吿的經騐，在他攤地臨近的墻壁上，以淺近的圖畫或辭句來宣傳，不無有點收穫。入有過其攤者，見其售品是多了，攤地擴大了，這不是他的奮鬬成功嗎。</p>
<p>民間故事</p>
<h3>陳二郎</h3>
<p>— 阿大</p>
<p>江陰城被淸兵攻破了。淸兵攻江陰八十多天，死傷不可計數，這回江陰被攻下，淸兵爲報復起見，進城不管大小，亂殺一陣，直殺得血腥遍城屍骨如山，總算是悽慘萬分了，至今江陰的老年人還不能忘當時情况。談得津津有味呢，</p>
<p>那是淸兵下令封刀的第三日，里巷之間仍是人影絕迹，淸兵走過大恨江陰人不够殺，因爲他們全不見一個人影，忽然有一淸兵看到路旁屍堆上的有死屍在蠕動，他不免躊躇起來，是殭屍呢？是野狗呢？他不得而知，經過他一度注視之後，他才驚訝的說，「哦哦原來是人，機會來了！」　說着便拔出了腰刀！</p>
<p>的確，是人而且是一個八九歲的孩子，他躱在屍堆內已有四天了，這回，餓得實在難受，只得冒險的爬出來，只見他混身是血，但揩去之後，顯然是一個天眞可愛的孩子，眉目淸秀，形狀可憐，一付天眞的稚氣，看得滿兵殺意全消，倒覺得可愛起來了，</p>
<p>「小傢伙，跑過來，我不殺你！」　滿兵這樣喚他，他也無畏的跑過去，一喂小傢伙你姓什麼？」</p>
<p>「我姓陳，人家都呌我陳二郞」這孩子的回答更打動了滿兵的心，滿兵打了十幾年的仗只曉得殺人，而人與人之間的目然樂趣從來沒有領略過，如今聽了二郞的回答不覺哈哈大笑，覺得小傢伙倒很好玩。「喂，二郞，你就跟我在一起好吧？」　　　　「好的，我就跟你在一起。」　　　　「你喜歡我麼？」　　　　「我喜歡你。」於是二郞跟滿兵回去了滿兵又爲二郞在衣店內我幾件衣服，因此在滿營內格外引人們的美感了所大家都喜歡和他玩，而他也出入滿營，也不以爲奇了。但此　爲滿將所聞，便下令召二郞去見，這件事大家都爲二郞擔心，以爲是凶多吉少。（未完）</p>

<h3>一週戰局</h3>
<p>本週戰况，就整個戰局上看來，日軍仍無多大進展，雖欲南攻北海，西犯陝邊，但前途困難正多，茲將各戰塲之情况，分誌如下：</p>
<p>廣東方面</p>
<p>沿粵漢廣九廣三各路日軍。近來均無異動，戰事顯得沉寂，花縣自上週被日軍的兩三千之優勢部隊佔據後，近被輩軍大軍積極反攻，乃得正式收復。又犯華沙井陣地之日軍，經某師及地方部隊夾擊之下，業已向太平方面潰退。因此廣州之日軍又復入華軍重圍，至於灟州島之日軍，雖有二千以上，然多爲台鮮及山東籍僞軍，正規軍極少，日繼在北海附近洋面者現僅有小型航空母艦一艘而已，餘均游弋無定。</p>
<p>山西方面</p>
<p>自前週晋西華軍克服吉縣，大寗，鄉寗，蒲縣，等重要據點後，日軍大爲震怒，乃轉道從晋西南三角地作打算，（按此地乃日軍勞師數月，犧牲最大之地。）向中條山之華軍陣地猛攻，想以三角地帶奠定將來西進之基礎。故有日軍三千附砲七門由解縣分三路向中條山進犯，一面並另派日軍二千，自晋東晋陽，南犯和順，遙爲呼應，經華軍拼命奮戰，現已解圍，解縣日軍，聞已後退，但和順方面之日軍，仍甚頑强，華爲戰略關係，已自動退出。然日軍關帝廟方面受華方奮勇抵抗，損失頗大，兩相折抵，適得其平。</p>
<p>湘鄂方面　　　　湘北戰事平靜，駐岳陽一帶日軍，大部已撤至鄂境，集中黃陂孝感，似將有所動作，然鄂中京山，鄂北淅河，數日來戰事，日方並未得利，京山，天門，雖於上週相繼淪陷，經華軍奮勇反攻，京山曾一度克復，現與日軍仍在混戰中，淅河之戰，日部隊有相常損失，預計戰事必有轉機。因爲一週來之戰果，事實上已說明日方實力之如何情况了。</p>
<p>其他方面　　　　河南方面，豫北日軍，本週會自博愛，修武，以二三千之主力，南同華軍主力進犯，經華軍阻擊，已有成效，皖南方面，前由灣沚向華軍進犯之日軍三千餘，本週經華軍繼續應戰，據傳聞日方犧牲在三分之一以上，河北方面，華方在鉅鹿與日軍曾發生激戰。情况未明，綏遠方面，自上週日軍進攻失敗後，現無多大變化，惟駐固陽武川一帶之僞軍（第四師第六師）三四千日來均相繼反正。</p>
<h3>我</h3>
<p>— 輯記者</p>
<p>「我」是對「人」的稱呼。　　　　天沒有生「我」，先已生「人」，有了「人」，才能見其爲　　　　「我」。　　　　在我的眼光裏看「我」，固然是「我」；在人的眼光裏看「我，」就是「人」了。　　　　所以，人我原是一體。人人沒有飯吃，我有飯也難獨飽，人人沒有衣穿，我有衣也難獨暖，人人沒有屋住，我有屋也難獨安。　　　　我吃飯，人吃粥；我穿裘，人穿棉衣；我住房子，人住收容所。然而，吃飯，穿衣，住房子的「我」，至少要使「人」有粥可吃，有棉衣可穿，有收容所可住。　　　　所以，救「人」即是救「我」，再說得透澈一點，實在不是救「人」，乃是救「我」；人雖至愚，何至於連「我」都不救呢？</p>

<h3>自殺</h3>
<p>— 賡</p>
<p>自殺，是最卑劣，最懦怯的行爲，所以一般社會對於自殺，祇有痛惡，沒有憐惜。</p>
<p>自殺者，想以自殺的手段來懺悔自殺的原因，所以最卑劣，想以死來排除生的困難，所以最懦怯·雖然說自殺的成因很多，有的爲了不堪經濟的壓迫，有的爲了爭取婚姻的自由，有的爲了環境人事的逆襲，有的爲了口角，有的爲了洩憤，但是自殺者的理智的泯減和勇氣的橫溢，是終該被社會所痛惡的。</p>
<p>上海自從淪爲孤島，自殺事件，較前更多，本報社會版，差不多每天都有自殺新聞的記載，而且日必二三起，自殺之風，可謂盛矣！</p>
<p>從這許多自殺事件裏，反映出孤島的生活是怎樣的艱困，人事是怎樣的複雜，和環境是怎樣的惡劣了。醫如：本報三日社會版所載：</p>
<p>鹽城人張連生，年四十一歲，在漢口路美味齋食品店充當賬席，最近耳聞滬西賭風甚熾，不覺引起好奇之心，每晚收市後，潛往賭窟，希圖徼倖，但虎阱之內，安有完璧，故未及數宵，已將所有血汁積蓄輸盡，甚且拖延店賬五十元，而小月底又將屆臨，實在無法彌補，一時情急，惟恐無顏見人，遂呑服毒品自殺。這正告訴我們：孤島邊緣的所謂王道樂土一中，設着的陷阱是多麽的危險，和建立在敵人刺刀上的僞組織，所佈施的「繁榮政策」是多麼的毒辣與可怕！</p>
<p>關於喪生在滬西賭窟裏的事件，我們時有所聞，比較引人注意的，則前有國際飯店侍役桑國才的跳樓自殺，和而今張連生事件，我們深信，社會上一般對於桑張二人的自殺，不　不會給予錯誤的同情，而且還要唾駡。理由很簡單，敵人佈置好陷阱在誘惑你入彀，爲什麼要效飛蛾之撲火，自取滅亡。何况賭博原是罪惡，本不該好奇，而希圖徼倖。</p>
<p>不過話得說回來，自殺罪惡的責任，當然該由自殺者担負的，可是自殺的客觀因素的消除工作，一般社會工作者是不能够推卸的。</p>
<h3>劇台外史</h3>
<p>— 瞿史公</p>
<p>徐訏，這個「論語派」和「宇宙風」的紅人，喜看幽默文字的讀者，總不會不知道他的姓名的吧。</p>
<p>現在每星期二在「集納「撰寫「水曜戲劇講座」的，那位先生就是幽默作家徐訏。</p>
<p>奇怪不是？徐訏怎會寫起「戲劇講座」來？</p>
<p>現在，讓我來告訴你罷。</p>
<p>遠在九年前，那時是一九三〇年，徐訏剛剛跑出北平的北京大學，他跟國立北平藝術學院畢業的謝興，「沙樂美」俞珊的弟弟兪啟忠，金陵大學的龔漫熳，濟南戲劇實騐學院的龔家珍（筆名蘋顰），以及善唱外國歌的徐素雪等數十人，在北平組織了個時空社。他們的出版部曾發行「時間」和「時空運動」二個週刊；他們的戲劇部，那麽曾在一九三一年二月十一日南下，跑到蘇州，假北局的東方大戲院公演過「慳吝人」（五幕劇，莫里哀Moliere作），「啞妻」（二幕劇，法郎士Anatole　France作），和「多餘的一夜」（獨幕劇，徐訏作）等三個戲。</p>
<p>徐訏的戲劇生活，可說就在這個時候開始的。那時，我却巧在蘇州，曾經看過徐訏主演的「慳吝入」，也看過他編寫的「多餘的一夜」。印象的地說，他的演技是相當不差的，唯一的缺點，那麼是動作與動作之間，失却聯繫，這，也許在外行人的眼中，反而以爲好的，因爲當時很有些觀客說他的表演細膩得很。至於那個劇本，我却實在不敢恭維，全然沒有舞台效果的。</p>
<p>話說他們公演的第一天，凑巧是雪天，空中飄了整天的雪花，地上積着沒腔的厚雪，「營業」是慘極了，偌大的戲院，只有最前的幾排坐位上，寥寥的坐着十幾個看客。第二天，第三天，賣座雖說比較有些起色，但看客也不滿三四十人的。</p>
<p>他們原定二個月後，再作二决公演的，現在出乎意料之外的遭到蘇州人土的冷淡，他們不能不把這個計劃打消了。不久，時空社也就無形停頓，只在蘇州城內「史家巷三十一號」股了個通訊處。</p>
<p>徐訏的戲劇生活，也就在這時結束了。</p>
<p>當然，在這短短的幾年中，徐訏是曾接觸過戲劇理論的。但一定要說他有過怎樣的研究，那便沒法使人深信。</p>
<p>徐訏，你說你是「像隻出入荊棘里的禿毛駱駝般的人」，我願你少說空話，回到戲劇圈來，努力地担負起救亡運動的重任來吧！</p>
<h3>收音機中的哀音</h3>
<p>— 蘇英</p>
<p>我家中雖然有一架收音機，而我對它却無甚興趣。因爲在大上海淪陷以後，已經聽不見我所喜歡的雄壯的歌聲和嚴正的演辭了，就是要聽到一些較爲入耳的東西也是難得：不是鬧得頭昏腦脹，就是陰陽怪氣的靡靡之音，所以，我索興把它擱在一旁不去開它，倒還淸靜一點。</p>
<p>前天，爲了難童敎養院的播音宣傳大會」，我例外的把那滿遮着灰塵的收音機開了，一家人圍坐着靜聽。</p>
<p>起先，是一個報吿員的替難童呼籲聲，後來却來了一個難童的聲音，聽來不過十三四歲的光景。他開口就這樣說：</p>
<p>「各位聽衆，我在這裏一鞠躬！……」</p>
<p>這聲音怪淒慘的，更使我們雀靜的聽着。</p>
<p>「我今年十三歲，鎮江人。去年的秋天，我就在雜亂中失去了我唯一的爸媽。因爲我沒有親戚，祗能睡在馬路邊。後來遇着了一個三十多歲的善人，才把我介紹到這裏（難童敎養院）來，還出了錢養我六年，我現在能够安心的住在這裏，全是他賜給我的。假使這位先生也在聽的話，我在這裏很誠懇的感激……」</p>
<p>這時，我的媽和妻都張着口呆呆的望着收音機，她們是被這孩子的播音所感動了。</p>
<p>「各位聽衆，我現在再向你們二鞠躬！因爲我們的敎養院，並不是給我們吃飽就算，還得請了敎師來敎導我們，使我們將來不會變成一個祇會吃飯的廢物，可是我們的地方太小，而和我一樣不幸的人還是源源而來，所以要向諸位善心的人，多多的捐輸，來救我們這一羣可憐的小生命。本來，我也是一個好人家的兒子，有吃有穿，從沒有向人家要過一個錢，現在我的爸，……媽……」</p>
<p>他說到這裏，竟忍不住嚎啕痛哭起來，大的想着了他的父母。</p>
<p>上海是有着數十萬具的收音機，聽到這决播音的當然不少，希望多多地帮助這些苦難的孩子們！</p>
<p>影評</p>
<h3>碧玉雄心</h3>
<p>— 如華</p>
<p>藝華公司出品　新光大戲院映「碧玉雄心」和一海天情侶一一樣，是藝華公司戰前攝製的作品，而且是沒有完工的；及至重行工作之後，又因爲戰後人事上的變動，這部電影就或多或少沒有做到預期的優美，道自然是非常可惜的。</p>
<p>不過從影片的本質上講，「碧玉雄心」並沒有因爲是「未完成的作品一而减低它的價值。它是一張反軍閥的影片，寫軍閥專橫時代，在鐵蹄下求生的民衆，是如何地企求着光明的到來。每一個人，每一條心爲了正義，向着光明，都堅决地團結起來，以他們的血肉，爭取「最後的勝利」。王志羣的慘受鞭刑，鐘樓老人也是慘死鞭下，以這種前仆後繼的精神，終於撲滅了代表軍閥餘孽的秦旅長。所以，「碧玉雄心」在「此時此地」公映，正給予我們繼續着這種前仆後繼的精神的鼓勵，而更堅定我們的信念，向勝利之途邁進！</p>
<p>從現在銀幕上所看刲的，導演者對於暴露軍閥的無惡不作，及革命黨人的艱苦卓絕，也已盡了最大的力量。如影片一開始，他就描寫軍閥爪牙的魚肉民衆，殺死張明父母，及後面的鞭打革命黨等等。</p>
<p>個別塲面也有幾塲可取的戲，如　秦旅長做壽：導演者先寫秦玉英介紹胡剛和吳娟芬相見；吳娟芬在後園向胡剛調情；　秦玉英雖感到不快，但在王志羣追問胡剛的時候，她就要求志羣陪她看戲，以免撞破胡剛和吳娟芬的秘密，及至張明行刺，槍聲起處，滿堂騷然，導演者把多方面錯綜的情緒，還相當過得去。　秘密開會：他是這樣寫的，黨友向各方送信；王志羣化裝前往；吳娟芬發現秘密字條；吳娟芬打電話給胡剛，適秦玉英接電話；秦旅長接到電話；知道革命黨開會所在；秦玉英趕到吳娟芬處，搶了字條去報吿黨友：及　革命黨被捕後，王志羣被鞭，鐘樓老人不忍睹此慘狀，願招供以贖罪和　被逼上鐘樓撞鐘等幾塲戲也還緊張。　張明行刺後，逃到胡剛臥室，適吳娟芬米，纏糾着不肯走，最後竟睡在胡剛床上，這時候床上睡的吳娟芬，床下藏匿着張明，胡剛獃坐在沙發裏，這是很有趣味的一塲戲。</p>
<p>不過在織接上是顯得混亂了一點，因之使整個戲的發展頗多兀突之處。寫作上也成問題的是王志羣和吳娟芬的關係不够明顯：秦玉英痴愛胡剛的缺乏過程，在沒有參加革命黨會議之前，王志羣這人物的性格不明；允其是巧合太多，及最後「各處兵變，滿城火起「的時候，祇是以王志羣槍殺吳娟芬來收塲，連最低限度的秦旅長都沒有下落，這些都是很大的缺點。</p>
<p>演員以文逸民的搶鐘老人最好，沉着而有力·袁美雲的張明，王引的胡剛，王乃東的王志羣都稱職。范雪朋的吳娟芬有些做作。</p>
<h3>寫在雜寫集後</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>靈犀兄把他近幾年所寫成的雜文，挑選了十多萬字，印成一個單冊，這眞是一個可喜的音訊。</p>
<p>我很歡喜讀靈犀的雜文，五六年來，幾乎是沒有間斷的在讀。我覺着在他的雜文裏，即使一鱗一爪，兩語三言，也都無往而不表現着一種誠摯的心懷，燃燒着强烈的正義感。再益以樸質淸麗的作風，遂使讀者閱讀時，如對故人，如在瓜棚豆架下，和敬愛的友朋，坦胸露腹，在娓娓地淸談。</p>
<p>當然，在這些雜文裏，也反映着這幾年來在變革中的中國社會。</p>
<p>我很高興這部雜文集的出版，同時，我希望在最近的將來，靈犀兄能有更發展的雜文集刊印問世。</p>

<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第三回　仰遺容追思老義士　開文盲問字小先生</p>
<p>何儷玉道：『我們在外國，倒也聽說過，只不知道詳細』金澹雲道：『像黃老爹那樣，請敎他的孫兒，便是實行小先生制了。大概以兒童去敎成人，比了成人去敎兒童，其效力更大。因爲兒童自有其愛嬌可喜之處，不比成人，擺出了嚴厲的面孔。去年我曾見一則小學生寫的日記，那是一個小女學生，她寫道：「今天我敎婆婆一課書，她推說事忙，不肯讀。後來我哭了。她只得順着我，把那課書上了」。婆婆不肯讀書，孫女兒哭了，這豈不是個笑話嗎？然而在盛行小先生制中，這也覺得尋常』。林建成道：『老年人向擊，倒是中國戰後盛行起來。我住的地方相近，設了一個成人補習學校。其中也有幾位年老的女人，他們也是興匆匆的每天去上學。到了放學的時候，鄰近認得的人，和她打招呼，問道：「喂！老太太阿是放學哉？我聽了，覺得耳朶裹怪陌生。從來只聽得說：小阿官放學，小姑娘放學，那是聽慣了的。老太太放學，可就覺得別緻了。但這終究是個好現象」。四個人離開了圖書館，金澹雲冉想引導她們到別處去看看。然而日已西傾，何家兩位小姐，便想回去了。因爲她們明天想到自由村去，回去以後，略爲料理料理她父親水了之事。何先生這回到上海來，兩位小姐倒當了幾天臨時書記咧。金澹雲見她們有想回去之意，也不敢多留，因各處游玩，也是很辛苦的呢。回去時，先是金澹雲開了汽車，後來林建成接開了。何家兩位小姐，也是自己會開汽車的，但不甚精熟。况且上海地方她們是新來，路徑也不十分熟咧·近來上海地方，有私家汽車的，自然比前增多。可是有一個原則，有汽車的人，必能自己開汽車。除了老年紀人和小孩子，以及耳目不聰明，手足不靈便的人。允其是女太太們，家裹有汽車，或自己有汽車的人，非自己會開汽車不可。因爲現在用汽車夫的人很少的了，除非是那種大汽車行裏，專備了汽車，供人雇用出差之處。一家中，夫婦都能開汽車，而夫婦都有職業在外面，同出同進，道是多麽便利呀！　（三二）</p>

<h3>歌塲摭舊錄</h3>
<p>— 君美</p>
<p>北　方報載，當年紅極一時之金少梅，自與小丑馬少山仳離後，近在張家口貧困不堪，竟至渝爲卑田院中人。按少相爲坤伶金月梅女，自幼知書識字，聽頴異常，及長，從時小福弟子江順仙學靑衣花衫諸劇，益以其母心得，故造詣獨深，而態度大方，其扮相允非當時一般坤伶所能企及。少梅演劇，最能體貼劇情，當樂者必極形其樂，當悲者必極形其悲；以故隸演於故都城南遊藝園時，激賞之者，多爲一般白髮耆老，靑年閨秀，見其樂則笑逐顏開，見其悲則心酸淚隨，甚至組織老人會太太團以力捧之，一時盛名幾與喜奎埒。乃曾幾何時，潦倒至此，此中人五年一世，以盛時而論，固矣。至結果之凄慘若此，則似非始料所及者。念「粉盒脂鈿等捐棄，此中日夕淚如泥一之詞，少梅誠有不堪回首者矣！</p>
<p>「戰皖城」一劇，晚近已漸淪爲冷戲，蓋此劇包羅角色，無論生，旦，凈，丑，末俱全，若張繡之生，鄒氏之旦，曹操之凈，典韋之武二花，胡車兒之開口跳，使非搭配齊整，决不敢輕於搬演。劇中張繡一角，有以武生飾者，有以老生飾者，揆諸劇情，自以武生飾爲正宗，至以老生飾此，則老譚實爲始作俑。惟老譚原爲武生，演此自然出色當行，時伶無老譚之武工，演此其不遺東施效顰之譏也發希。彙者，江湖班名伶小聾彭，演此劇頗膾炙人口，其念唱之精警，武工之卓越，與夫表情之細膩熨貼，實有獨到處。如當張繡旣降曹換後，操入城觀其牌軍演陣，繡因不勝感慨，俯首而行，乃先後與許褚典韋互撞。此處小聾彭於典則謙抑恭順，曲意逢迎，若不勝其恐懼者；而於許則略一點首，僅呈敷衍之態。蓋繡之與操，所懼者典韋而已，許褚等人，初不欲低首示弱也。而常伶演此，則互撞時俱爲一副面貌。叉當繡聞其嬸鄒氏被刦，往曹營探詢時，操略不經意，即命鄒婢春梅出而奉茶，常伶演至此，必竭力形容其驚憤。實則繡驟睹此狀，驚憤之色固理所應有，而以操之猜疑，繡决不敢遽形之於顏面，故小聾彭於此，驚憤之態僅一露即歛，以示絕不介意，爲張繡設身處地，頗入情入理。二十年來，曾歷觀名伶演此，膛乎遠矣！以視英秀當年，固所不逮，而侷促於江湖班中，母乃不幸之尤歟！</p>
<h3>說旦</h3>
<p>— 愛萍室主</p>
<p>旦　有正旦花旦，老且，彩旦，武旦之分，正旦即靑衣，亦名靑衫，乃表示賢婦貞女，最重唱工，如「祭江」之孫夫人，「敎子」之王春娥，「桑園會」之羅敷等是也。</p>
<p>花旦即崑曲所謂貼者是也表示　淫　悍之婦女，以念日及做工見長。閩門，玩笑，刀馬三項，如「小上墳」，「雙搖會」，以及「打麵缸」，「頂花磚」等戲之旦角，均爲玩笑旦。至於「馬上緣」，「穆柯寨」及「虹霓關一等戲之旦角，則爲刀馬旦，舞弄刀槍，以姿勢美觀爲主，不必以武技起打見長，故列入花旦之類也。介乎靑衣花旦之間者，曰花衫，如「探母」之公主，「虹霓關」之丫環，是表示聰明通達之女子，唱同靑衣，念與做均近花旦，端莊流利，兼而有之，自王瑤卿創始，梅蘭芳繼之，而花衫之名稱，遂發現於劇界也。　　老且爲飾演百歲以下，四五十歲以上之婦人，必須生有婆子相者，裝來恰合身分，如「滑油山」之劉靑提，「徐母駡曹」之徐母均是，演是項角色佳者，僅已故之龔雲甫一人而已，如「送親演禮」之陳氏，「鐵蓮花」之馬氏，「普球山」之竇氏，以及「四進士」之宋媽媽，「拾玉鐲」之劉媒婆等，此項多爲文丑所兼演，以脚色論之，仍應列入旦類。　　　　武旦以武技爲重，翻觔斗，盤攔桿，傳像伙，均爲應有之技，容貌不必如刀馬之美，身段不必如刀馬之媚，而技擊必須精熟，跌找必須穩健，有非刀馬之所能及者，此旦之所以爲武也，如「畫春園」，「三岔口」，「靑石山」，「水漫金山等皆武旦戲。</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（九七）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>老譚問劉鴻聲怎麽死法</p>
<p>在汪潭孫三大派以外，鬚生界裏還有劉派這個名詞·劉派的創始人就是跛子劉鴻聲，這人唱戲不大講究宇眼，又因害髒病壞了一條腿，對於作工當然不成，要談到靠把，越發不用提了。所以劉跛的戲只能聽聽嗓音衷氣，至於他所會的戲也祇寫寥幾齣，因此半津人士就給他編了一套話，說道「三斬一探，碰碑滾蛋」，這個意思就是說他頭三天打泡戲老是「斬子」「斬謖一一斬黃袍」。中間再演幾齣不很吃重的戲像「完璧歸趙」「金水橋」「打金技」等，頂多能連唱二十天不重樣的戲，然後就要翻回頭燙剩飯了·及至館子裹一貼「碰碑」，他就要蹓之大吉了。</p>
<p>聽戲本來要聽得痛快，要專門考究音韻字眼，那不過佔到聽客中百分之一二而已。所以鴻聲單靠他一條圓潤自如的嗓子，的確也曾哄動一時，在他極盛的時候，老譚都有些懼他。從前老譚也時常唱「斬子」，不過詞句與劉跛不同罷了。他因這齣戲沒甚作工。全是使戞調，翻花腔，賣嗓子的唱工戲，正合了劉繁子的路子，因此他就把這戲收起，不再演唱。誰知後來劉跛却不同他客氣，慢慢的同老譚比賽着唱「失空斬」，幸而譚派「三探」的表情，各有各的神色，各有各的語氣唸白，就這幾手，那是誰都學不了的。他人演此，不失之瘟，就失之火。老譚那種神情，眞稱得起是爐火純靑，妙不可言。要論譚氏「三探」的妙處，待將來專文詳述，因至少須一二千字，方能說的透澈，所以此處暫且不談。鴻聲雖想以此劇與老譚爭一日短長，但是結果總是失望。</p>
<p>「洪羊洞」劇中的「自那日」一段二黃快三眼，也是譚氏的絕唱，這齣戲却是唱作並重，只講味兒不賣嗓子的譚派名劇。不料鴻聲不自量力，居然也動起這齣戲來了。老譚實在有些氣不過，等到鴻聲貼演是劇的那天，老譚也躱在人叢裏偷聽，瞧瞧劉跛倒底是好在甚麽地方？究竟有何魔力能吸引許多看容你想北京城那個戲園子裹的看座的不認得他老人家，就是一般老於顧曲的人們，也都識得他的。</p>

<p>(Chongqing) According to Chinese sources received here today, Japanese troops concentrated near Hanyang, Fenglingdu, are now crossing the river from the north side of the bend in the Yellow River. Chinese artillery on the Shaanxi side of the west bank is currently bombarding Japanese positions, and Japanese artillery is returning fire. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Tongguan: The Japanese "78th" and "79th" Regiments that attacked Zhongtiao Mountain have now withdrawn and are entrenched in villages near various mountain passes. Japanese troops will attack the Gongguan Village area to the west. No Japanese troops are visible on the summit of Canglongyu Mountain. (Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Yuanqu: On the evening of the 2nd, Japanese troops took advantage of heavy fog to advance northeastward, first heavily shelling the Chinese positions at Dujiazhuang and Junjialing. They then launched an infantry assault on the Chinese forces. After thirty minutes of fighting, they were repelled by the Chinese army. At the same time, a small group of Japanese soldiers harassed Yaoyuan from Liyaotou, but they were also repelled. At nightfall, the Chinese Yuan Regiment dispatched troops to drive out the Japanese from Dujiazhuang. The fighting lasted until around 11 o'clock, when the Japanese, unable to withstand the attack, collapsed and fled to the surrounding mountains. At dawn on the 3rd, the Japanese army resumed shelling the Chinese Yuan Regiment's positions, followed by an infantry force of over 200 men attacking Dujiazhuang, Suhancun, and Anjiagou. By about 9 o'clock, all had been scattered by the Chinese forces. However, a small number of Japanese remnants remain entrenched in Dujiazhuang and are currently being mopped up. (Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Yuanqu: On the afternoon of the 1st, Japanese troops facing off against the Chinese army in Yuli, Wangjiali, and Guanyakou, east of Huoxian County, were harassed by a Chinese detachment. After fierce fighting all night, the Japanese infantry dared not move on the morning of the 1st due to heavy fog. They only used artillery to heavily shell the Chinese Yue Regiment's positions at Yuli, Guanjia Mountain, and Yangjiazhuang, and fired many poison gas shells. At noon, the Chinese Yang Battalion and Ai Regiment launched a pincer attack from the north and south from places like Duzhuang. After fierce fighting until 4 p.m., the Japanese army ultimately failed to achieve its aims. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. (Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>Yuanqu: Liaoxian City, which was once captured by the Japanese army on the 31st of last month, was retaken by the Chinese army on the 2nd after reinforcements were dispatched. The Chinese army is now pursuing the Japanese troops advancing in eastern Shanxi along different routes. It is believed that it will not be difficult to eliminate them. (Telegram, 5th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Fighting in the southwest Shanxi triangle area continues. It is reported that Japanese troops in central Shanxi are now moving south in succession. At the same time, Japanese troops in eastern Shanxi and northern Henan are also advancing towards the Yellow River bank, so river defenses have become tense. The focus of the war is still in the Zhongtiao Mountain area, but the Chinese army has a significant advantage. The Japanese army is continuing to use all its strength to attack the Chinese forces on the mountain, attempting to occupy it to avoid future troubles. However, due to depleted strength, it will be difficult to achieve its aims. Yesterday, Japanese troops in Yongji, Fenglingdu, and other places shelled the Chinese forces on the south bank, and the Chinese forces returned fire. Both sides fought fiercely until dusk. It is reported that there are currently four Japanese divisions fighting in the southern Shanxi triangle area. Another division is attacking the Eighth Route Army in eastern Shanxi. Because they have suffered repeated defeats in the past ten days, suffering heavy casualties, they plan to transfer three more divisions from Hebei and Chahar provinces to Shanxi in an attempt to succeed.

<h3>The Eighth Route Army Recaptures Hejian</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) According to foreign sources, a detachment of the Chinese Eighth Route Army advanced to Hejian County, northwest of Cangxian on the Jinpu Railway, on the 24th of last month and occupied it. When the Japanese army heard the news, they sent a large force to assist. The Eighth Route Army completely destroyed the entire city, including roads. The 40,000 residents of the city were unwilling to be slaves to the Japanese army again and voluntarily withdrew with the Eighth Route Army. When the Japanese army entered the city, there was only scorched earth, and there were fewer than ten residents in the city, so they fled in panic. On the 2nd of this month, the Eighth Route Army led the people to enter Hejian County again as a base for cutting off the Japanese army's transportation on the Jinpu Railway.

<h3>Japanese Troops Suffer Casualties Between Tongshan and Chongyang</h3>
<p>Pingjiang: The Chinese guerrillas ambushed the Japanese army in two routes between Tongshan and Chongyang on the night of the 3rd, inflicting heavy casualties. At that time, one route detected that more than 100 Japanese troops from Baini Bridge were moving along the highway toward Chongyang. The Chinese army ambushed Gaojialing, east of the road. When the Japanese troops passed by, they used their advantageous high ground to give them intensive fire, killing more than a dozen Japanese soldiers and capturing a large number of guns and ammunition. The remaining Japanese soldiers fled in a panic back to Baini Bridge. Another route detected that there was a Japanese company entrenched in Tongpenling, three miles south of Nanlin Bridge, and that they had built fortifications. They stealthily advanced at night. When they approached the Japanese army, they first set fire to the barracks and then destroyed the barbed wire erected around them. The Japanese army responded in a panic.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Turning Point in the World Situation</h3>
<p>Those who are truly great statesmen in the world must rely on an understanding of their own country and an observation of changes in the world, possessing foresight and a clear understanding of the truth. In their actions, they must seize opportunities, carefully consider flexibility and firmness, act independently, and be able to advance and retreat. Only then can they place their country on a foundation of stability and expand its power to a state of prosperity. That Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the United States, and Russia are the six powers of the world today is no accident. It has been said before that Japan currently has no great statesmen. Looking back on those years, they defeated the Qing Dynasty and seized Korea, allied with Britain and drove back Russia, winning every battle and eventually abandoning Liaodong. Emperor Meiji's decision had its own reasons that could not be reached, but those days are gone. They reaped the rewards of the September 18th Incident and isolated themselves by rejecting the Lytton Report. At that time, the world did not dare to confront Japan's warlike ambitions, and few sympathized with China after its long period of turmoil. If Japan had stopped at that point and focused on its own development, the international position of Japan today would be unimaginable. However, with insatiable desires and a feverish mood, they eventually lost the focus of their national policy and their sense of reason. They neither understood that violence was not enough to annex China, nor did they understand that the spirit and potential of the Chinese people were enough to sustain a long-term struggle. When faced with strong resistance, they failed to know when to retreat. Despite the advice of Germany and the persuasion of other countries, they failed to change their plans. Now they are internationally isolated, and all kinds of pressure will gradually increase. Millions of soldiers have been killed or wounded on the front lines, and millions of resources have been turned into fireworks. Their essence has been exhausted, their strength has been depleted, and collapse is not far away. If they had great statesmen, they should have turned back in time, even if they could not restrain their horses on the precipice in the past. But look at the way the ruling and opposition parties in their parliament interact, they are still cowardly, hypocritical, and making inflammatory speeches to deceive the people and the world. Compared to the European statesmen in this turbulent time, how few are the words and deeds of these Japanese that hit the mark! Is it not that there is a huge difference between the Eastern and Western worlds, and between the Yellow and White races?</p>
<p>This newspaper previously discussed the speeches of German Chancellor Hitler, British Prime Minister Chamberlain, and US President Roosevelt. It was said that future important international actions will be closely related to these speeches, and that the international community will reserve its pessimism or optimism until Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech at the Fascist Grand Council on the 4th of this month. Even the British government is waiting to see this speech to decide whether to proceed with the British-Italian economic talks. Indeed, the focus of current international disputes and the most acute point of opposition is between France and Italy. Italy is at the forefront of the issue, and Prime Minister Mussolini is the soul of its initiative. If Mussolini makes a tough statement and puts forward conditions that France cannot accept, then Hitler, Chamberlain, and Roosevelt's painstaking efforts will all become illusions, and ultimately they will inevitably lead to Europe being stained with blood, driving millions of lives into the fire pit, and turning all civilized wealth into ashes. However, news has come that the Fascist Grand Council adjourned at midnight, and the Prime Minister's speech was not made public. However, because it was not made public, there is no way to know its content. What can be inferred is that the speech was addressed to the domestic audience and to the party, not to the international community. If it were addressed to the international community, they would have feared that it would not be spread quickly and widely enough, and there would have been no reason to keep it secret. The international crisis is here, and the world is watching, but Mussolini is so profound. Does he have a real understanding and the ability to advance and retreat? The extraordinary skills and flexibility of a great world statesman cannot be measured by ordinary standards. Compared to Japan's "pushing the cart against the wall" and pushing it all the way, considering not pushing as "losing face," how superior is he!</p>
<p>Furthermore, the fact that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini did not speak to the international community last night does not mean that he will be silent from now on, or that he will give up his desire for the international community, let alone that the world crisis will disappear from now on. The opportunity to speak can arise at any time, the desires of the nation have a long history, and before the Spanish Nationalist Army achieves complete victory and before the Italian volunteers withdraw, their desires will be more easily advanced, and their words will be more easily excited. So, it is still unknown how the future will unfold. However, with this postponement of the speech, there is room for diplomatic maneuvering. The greater the emotional restraint, the greater the extension of reason. With diplomatic maneuvering and the extension of reason, reasonable and legitimate desires can be easily compensated for through peaceful means. Moreover, with this wonderful pause in the overall situation, people will generally change their impression, saying that a totalitarian state is not necessarily a warlike state. This change in impression alone will inevitably lead to a more well-meaning consideration of Italy's reasonable desires. Judging from international public opinion in the near future, it will inevitably agree with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's prudence, and British Prime Minister Zhang's friendly mediation will not only involve the British-Italian economic talks. This is something that can be foreseen.</p>

<h3>People in Guerrilla Areas Refuse to Use Counterfeit Currency</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese side recently forged a large number of legal tender from the Chinese Central, China, Communications, and Farmers Banks, and used them in various guerrilla areas to confuse the real with the fake, attempting to shake the credit of the Chinese legal tender. It is found that Chinese legal tender is widely used in the guerrilla areas, and its credit is outstanding. They have long been able to distinguish the authenticity of the legal tender, so they are absolutely opposed to the Japanese side's poisonous scheme of issuing counterfeit money to disrupt the financial system and vow to refuse to use counterfeit money. The Japanese side's attempt has completely failed. (Telegram, 5th)</p>

<h3>Councilor Chen Shouming Arrives in Chongqing Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Overseas Chinese Councilor Chen Shouming arrived in Chongqing by plane on the 5th. Chen Shuren, Xiao Jishan, and representatives from the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs went to the airport to welcome him. Chen is a leader of the overseas Chinese in Siam and has strongly promoted and sponsored local public welfare and cultural undertakings. In the 22nd year of the Republic, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs appointed him as the Commercial Commissioner in Siam, striving to promote Sino-Siamese relations. After the outbreak of the War of Resistance, he has particularly supported various patriotic donations.

He was previously elected as a councilor, but was unable to attend the meeting due to other engagements. He will donate all the public funds he is entitled to, and will donate an additional 20,000 yuan to the government for making winter clothing. A month ago, his wife passed away in Hong Kong, and Chen also donated the condolences from his relatives and friends to the government for use in connection with the War of Resistance and disaster relief. His enthusiastic patriotism is deeply commendable. Chen holds an important commercial responsibility, and his arduous journey from afar has deeply touched and admired the people of the country. Shuren and others plan to host a dinner on the 6th to welcome Chen and invite relevant ministers to attend. (Dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3>Fascist Party Holds Supreme Council Meeting, Germany and Italy Maintain Political and Military Ties, Express Satisfaction with Hitler's Declaration, Decide to Assist Spanish Rebels to Complete Victory</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Fascist Supreme Council met last night at 10:00 p.m. and adjourned after two and a half hours. Afterwards, a communiqué was issued stating briefly that Mussolini had reported on the general international situation. The Supreme Council responded with applause, and the conclusion of this report received even more enthusiastic cheers. Foreign Minister Ciano explained certain special circumstances of Italian-French foreign policy. Mussolini criticized prominent points in Ciano's report. Subsequently, the meeting expressed deep satisfaction with Hitler's remarks at the sixth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's seizure of power, reiterating the unity of political, ideological, and military aspects, which has united the two revolutionary forces, namely Fascism and National Socialism, and the future of the two peoples. The Supreme Council met on the day the Spanish Nationalist forces occupied Girona, allowing the entire region of Catalonia to be freed from barbarous Bolshevism and oppression. Therefore, it sent a telegram congratulating the heroic Spanish and foreign combatants for their victory, and proclaimed to the world that Fascist volunteers would not withdraw until the end of the war and the victory of Fascism. The communiqué continued, stating that Mussolini then announced the plans for the celebration of the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Party on March 23rd, at which time the newly established Fascist and Corporate Council would be inaugurated. The meeting then announced that, based on Mussolini's proposal, it had been decided to take the opportunity of this anniversary to further develop the entire structure of social legislation. Finally, the meeting reviewed the report on national assets and liabilities for the fiscal years 1937 to 1938. The meeting will be convened again on February 11th. (Reuters dispatch, 5th)</p>

In addition, 50,000 government troops have been defeated on the northern front and are retreating towards the French border, having arrived at the border this afternoon. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Perpignan, France. Spanish Republican President Azaña, accompanied by Minister of Labor Risson, drove into France at 7:00 a.m. this morning. Afterwards, a large number of vehicles followed, carrying the president's staff and luggage. It is reported that they will temporarily reside here and will go to Paris after obtaining diplomatic passports. In addition, Prime Minister Negrín and other cabinet members are said to have flown from Figueres to Valencia. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The city of Girona in Spain was captured by Nationalist forces today. Italian General Bitosi was injured in the battle. Girona has a cathedral built in the 15th century, which is famous throughout the world. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Argelès-sur-Mer. After Nationalist aircraft repeatedly bombed Figueres yesterday afternoon and this morning, women, children, and the elderly fled to France in droves. The village of Agullana is only ten kilometers from the border. A large number of refugees gathered in the village. Nationalist aircraft bombed it fiercely today, causing countless casualties among the refugees. The Republican government's various departments have moved from Figueres to other places, but traffic between this city and other places is still unimpeded, and food supplies are arriving steadily.

<h3>West Republican Government Denies Seeking Peace</h3>
<p>London. It is widely rumored here tonight that the Spanish Republican government has a tendency to seek peace, but a spokesman for the Spanish Republican government has absolutely denied this. According to an announcement issued by the Spanish government at 10:40 tonight, "This rumor is completely unfounded. The government is determined to stick to its established policy and fight to the end." (AP dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>French Senator Arrives in Spain, Meets with Rebel Authorities, Arousing Suspicion in Rome</h3>
<p>Burgos. French moderate Senator Bérard, who was ordered to come and discuss the issue of refugee accommodation with the Spanish Nationalist forces authorities, arrived here from the port of Bilbao and immediately visited Nationalist government Foreign Minister Jordana for an hour and a half. Cultural Relations Minister Daixito was also present. Bérard subsequently told reporters that he was very grateful for the warm reception by officials and civilians in the Nationalist government's territory and Foreign Minister Jordana. He is scheduled to meet with Foreign Minister Jordana again on the 6th of this month and will stay in Spain for several days before returning home. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding French Senator Bérard's visit to Burgos to hold talks with the Nationalist authorities, Fascist Party members here have expressed suspicion, saying that France is now pursuing dual diplomacy, wanting Italy to fail. However, the Nationalist authorities clearly remember the friendship between Italian volunteers and the Spanish Nationalist forces fighting together and will not forget the biased attitude France held at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. France's intention is probably to send a diplomatic representative or even an ambassador to Burgos, thereby recognizing the Nationalist government, on the condition that the Nationalist forces do not approach the French border too closely. In addition to discussing the issue of repatriating Spanish refugees in France, Bérard's trip may also be to negotiate this matter with the Nationalist government authorities.

<h3>Japan to Have Severe Earthquake Within Next Six Weeks, Tokyo Imperial University Research Institute Issues Warning</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the Earthquake Research Institute of Tokyo Imperial University issued a warning on the 3rd of this month, stating that Japan will have a major earthquake within six weeks. It is said that the warning issued by the Institute is based on its observations along the Japanese coastline of the Pacific Ocean over the past five or six years. Since many years ago, the ground along the Japanese coast has shaken more than 6,000 times, and the frequency of earthquakes was particularly high in November and December of last year. As a result, the terrain has changed, and there is a high possibility of a major earthquake disaster. (Express dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Italy to Make Demands on France to Fulfill Natural Aspirations, France Sends Unofficial Representative to Rome, Hoping Both Sides Can Establish a Compromise Plan</h3>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will make demands on France within days. Their nature is still moderate, but they must be satisfied immediately. The most obvious are: 1. The Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway in French Somaliland, currently operated by a French company, should be transferred to Italy. 2. Djibouti should become a free port. 3. The legal status of Italian residents in French Tunisia in North Africa should be revised. 4. The French government should promise not to build fortifications or establish military airfields on the island of Corsica in the Mediterranean. The above are said to be Italy's minimum demands. If they are not satisfied immediately, Prime Minister Mussolini may threaten to make territorial demands. In addition, it is rumored that radical elements of the Italian Fascist Party intend to provoke incidents with France in the aviation field, hoping to trigger a crisis that would prompt British Prime Minister Chamberlain and German leader Hitler to act as arbitrators. Political figures here commented that if Italy pursues a more adventurous policy, it may not be supported by Germany. Italy's demands on France are still moderate, and the intention is to obtain Germany's support. In addition, although Italy and Germany maintain an advantage in the air force, this advantage will disappear as soon as this spring due to the United States selling aircraft to Britain and France. This is another reason why Italy is eager to be satisfied by France. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to reliable sources in the French government speaking to AP reporters, the French government is now trying to resolve the conflict between the two countries in the Mediterranean with Italy through informal private talks. The French side now plans to send Rothschild Bank Chairman Bauptain to Rome for an unofficial visit to explore a compromise solution to Mussolini's territorial demands on France. Although Bauptain does not represent the government on this trip, he certainly has the government's mission and has been authorized by the French government to negotiate a compromise with Mussolini. It is said that the French compromise plan is to have France and Italy jointly manage and operate the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway and to make Djibouti a free port for Italy to enter and exit Abyssinia, but it maintains a firm position of being unable to help with Italy's territorial demands.

<h3>Britain Plans to Inquire About Germany's True Intentions Through Diplomatic Channels, Soviet Diplomacy Is Flexible, Britain Fears German-Soviet Rapprochement</h3>
<p>(London) According to authoritative sources, the British Cabinet decided at a meeting on Thursday to test Hitler's intentions through diplomatic means because of Hitler's declaration on Monday. They said that if Germany really intends to open formal peace negotiations, British Prime Minister Chamberlain will be prepared to suggest to Hitler that a joint British-German declaration be issued, stating that both sides are committed to formal peace negotiations, and France and Italy will also participate. At the same time, diplomatic advisors believe that the atmosphere is still very tense, so it seems that this plan is of little benefit to Germany. However, it is said that Chamberlain's general colleagues are very optimistic and believe that Germany's opinions are indeed tending towards European harmony. According to reliable sources, the United Kingdom does not fully understand Germany's true opinions regarding colonies because Germany has not issued any formal requests, so the United Kingdom plans to temporarily ignore this issue. (AP dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources, British Ambassador to the Soviet Union Sir Seeds recently submitted a report to the Foreign Office, stating that Soviet foreign policy has become more flexible than in the past. The Soviet authorities have provided assurances that they will abide by the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance treaty and maintain friendship with Western European countries, but they also expect those countries to make some sacrifices. After reading the report, the British government is deeply concerned that Soviet foreign policy may change course and become closer to Germany. It has ordered Ambassador Seeds to strive for closer ties with the Soviet Union in economic and political terms. Since then, trade figures between the two sides are expected to increase, and the United Kingdom will provide credit facilities to the Soviet Union. As for political negotiations, the ambassadors of both sides should maintain close contact with the governments of the countries where they are stationed. All assistance from the British government, which used to be notified to Soviet Ambassador Maisky after the fact, will be notified as soon as possible in the future. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>

<h3>Recruiting Young Men and Women for Colonial Talent, Providing Special Training</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Germany trains hundreds of young men and women every year, preparing to relocate these young men and women to various places once the colonies lost during the European War are recovered. In addition, German doctors are receiving special training at the Hamburg School of Maritime and Tropical Medicine, and there is also a colonial administration school with special subjects in both theory and practice. If Germany's demands are met, it can immediately take over and manage the colonies without any difficulty. In Runstau, Holstein, there is a women's colonial school where German women aged 18 to 22 can enroll. They receive special training to be suitable as wives of general colonists. The school is directly under the command of the National Socialist Party's political colonial department and places more emphasis on instilling National Socialist ideology and eugenics and racial theories. In addition, modern life necessities such as horseback riding, driving cars, rowing, and shooting are also compulsory courses. The school's tuition and all expenses are very low, and the selection of students is not strict, so many students are enrolled. In Weidenhofen, there is also a similar male school that places special emphasis on tropical issues and teaches chemistry, mechanics, agriculture, and craft courses. After completing all the required courses, a diploma can be obtained. The school also plans to issue a notice saying, "Parents should send their children to study because overseas land can guarantee their future." (AP dispatch, 4th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Supplementary Budget Exceeds 6 Billion Yuan, Ministry of Finance Demands Reduction, Friction Occurs Between Army and Navy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) In the fiscal year beginning April 1, the supplementary budget for the Japanese army and navy will exceed 6 billion yuan (equivalent to £350 million). According to the figures submitted by the Army Ministry to the Ministry of Finance, the army's expenditure alone, including regular, temporary, and special items, will reach about 5.4 billion yuan (equivalent to £320 million). The army's expenditure for the current fiscal year is 3.821 billion yuan (equivalent to £225 million). The next budget is based on the so-called "two-power standard." Japan aims to be fully prepared to deal with China and the Soviet Union simultaneously if necessary. This estimate is to maintain the increase of Japanese troops in China, garrison troops in "Manchukuo," and replenish the air force and adjust military supplies. The regular military budget for the next fiscal year has been set at 490 million yuan, compared to 566 million yuan this year. The reduction is because the Manchurian temporary emergency expenses, which have always been included in the regular budget, have been allocated as part of the special military expenses for the 1939-1940 fiscal year. It is widely rumored that the navy has had major friction with the army because the army's huge military expenditure has hindered the navy's expansion. In the fiscal year beginning April 1, Japan's military budget will be 5.4 billion yuan, but it is expected that the Ministry of Finance will reduce it to 5 billion yuan. As for the expenses required by the navy, they have not yet been announced. However, judging from its declaration of wanting to build huge military equipment to protect the control of neighboring oceans, it can be seen that the navy will propose an important new ship-building program. The navy's regular budget for the next fiscal year is estimated to be 653 million yuan, a decrease of 27 million yuan from this year, because the naval war expenses in China have been allocated to special expenses. It is generally expected that the total amount of the navy's special budget will be around 1.2 billion yuan. Therefore, the total naval expenditure for the next fiscal year will reach 1.853 billion yuan (equivalent to £110 million). It is estimated that the total amount of special budgets for the army and navy will be approximately 7.2 billion yuan, and the total budget, including regular, temporary, and special expenses, will be 7.35 billion yuan (equivalent to £430 million).

<h3>Japanese Budget Committee Questions Situation</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tokyo News: The Japanese House of Representatives Budget Committee has begun to review the budget proposals by division. The subcommittee members have held meetings since the 3rd. At a meeting of the fourth subcommittee on the 4th, Minseito Party member Nakajima asked, "Former Army Chief Tojo Hideki once said that there were no defects in the Soviet equipment, is that still the case?" Sakata replied, "A portion of the Soviet equipment was transferred to the Chinese theater of war, and it is currently being replenished." From this question, it can be seen that Japan's Soviet equipment is weaker than before the war. In the near future, it may not dare to provoke the Soviet Union. At a meeting of the first subcommittee, a member asked, "For the sake of national defense, anti-communism, and security, will the army continue to station troops in China?" Sakata replied, "There is no reason to withdraw troops during the war. Even to build a new order, considerable military force is required." Minseito Party member Koyama Kazou asked, "How will the interests of third countries in China be resolved? Does the government intend to convene an international conference?" Sakata replied, "The idea of convening an international conference is good, but it has not yet been considered and will be studied." Sakata's reply was different in tone from Arita's previous reply in the Budget Committee. Arita was skeptical, while Sakata seemed to express approval, which is noteworthy. (Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>Conflict Erupts Again on Russian-Manchurian Border, Japanese Troops Provoke by Crossing Border, Repelled by Russian Defenders</h3>
<p>(Harbin) On February 4, a conflict between Japanese and Soviet sentries occurred on the northeastern border, 100 kilometers from Manzhouli. It is reported that on the 4th, Japanese sentries crossed the border three times—at 5:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., and 11:30 a.m.—and attacked Soviet outposts, but were bravely repelled by Soviet defenders. The Japanese offensive was purely exploratory in nature. Every time it saw a Soviet counterattack, it retreated in panic. Therefore, there were no casualties on either side yesterday.

<h3>Love and Marriage Age Matters Greatly</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University</p>
<p>To study the love between husband and wife, the age of both parties at the time of marriage must be taken into consideration. From a physiological point of view, the appropriate age for marriage should be when both the man and woman have reached maturity in mind and body, and when their judgment and character are fully developed. In other words, the proper age for marriage is between 23 or 24 and 26 or 27 for men, and between 20 and 23 or 24 for women. Being too early or too late is detrimental and unhelpful.</p>
<p>Early marriage not only harms one's own health and shortens one's lifespan, but also brings disaster to future generations. If a woman marries too early, her beauty will easily fade, and she will not be able to live out her natural lifespan. If a man marries too early, his physical strength will decline, and his sexual vigor will be easily damaged. Some men, due to early marriage, will damage the development of their reproductive organs and often suffer from infertility. Even if they do have children, they will be weak in every way.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the age of marriage has a significant relationship with the love between husband and wife. Why is this? Because the love between husband and wife comes from a healthy life, and happiness after marriage can only be enjoyed if sexual vigor is sound.</p>
<p>In today's hectic and complex life, our energy is often dissipated, and we age prematurely. We are unable to care for the development of love between husband and wife, so the sexual response of men tends to increase rapidly, while the sexual response of women becomes sluggish. This invisibly creates a chasm between the love of men and women. To fill this chasm, one can only start by increasing essence and replenishing blood, actively promoting the prosperity of the youth glands. Even if age has increased, one can still use this to rejuvenate and relive the joy of youthful health, because after the youth glands are strong, this discrepancy in sexual response between men and women can be transformed into harmony.</p>
<p>From a medical point of view, the reason why a person's energy is strong is none other than the prosperity of the youth glands. Therefore, if one can maintain the health of these youth glands, everything can be managed. If patients are aware of this deficiency, they can take "Buti Kang," a testicular essence preparation for men. This agent generates essence and strengthens the kidneys in a short period of time. Any weakness or incomplete development can be cured. After the husband takes it, he can make his wife's love lingering, and the joy of marital relations will be better than a newlywed couple's. Furthermore, "Buti Kang" has been tested by doctors in various countries and proven to be the best preparation for treating sexual weakness. Women with weakened bodies and irregular menstruation can take "Buti Kang" for women.</p>
<h3>Introducing a Good Medicine for Treating the Lungs</h3>
<p>— Sheng Zaiqiang, Physician</p>
<p>Based on my clinical experiments with lung diseases over the past 26 or 27 years, the medicine "Bu Fei Na Er" can truly be called a sacred remedy for lung diseases. This is because its ingredients are pure, and it aims to nourish the lungs and treat consumption. Therefore, no matter how difficult to completely cure the cough, after taking it for three hours, it can relieve cough and resolve phlegm with incredible effectiveness. It can not only cure coughs in a short period of time but also completely cure extremely dangerous pulmonary tuberculosis. According to my detailed statistics, for coughs caused by influenza and pulmonary catarrh, only taking "Bu Fei Na Er" can cure them radically in a short period of time. If other medicines are taken, they will inevitably linger and become chronic diseases.</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea Lecture</h3>
<p>— Narrated by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, at the intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Multiple Prostatitis</p>
<p>Cutting off the root of the disease, avoiding its many changes</p>
<p>Whenever gonorrhea turns chronic, its complications are bound to be numerous. When treating it, we must not abandon the fundamentals and pursue the superficial; we must cut off the root of the disease in order to hope that it will never recur. However, most patients do not seek this, but instead adopt a "treat the head when it hurts, treat the foot when it hurts" approach. Over-the-counter medicines also arise in response to the situation, like bamboo shoots after the rain, flourishing and growing. However, gonorrhea is seen to spread. Why is this? It is because, as I pointed out above, the root of the gonorrhea poison is not fundamentally resolved, but only superficial effects are sought, in order to gain the patient's trust. Among them, prostatitis, a symptom of gonorrhea, is the most prone to repeated changes. Many gonorrheal prostatitis cases, once past the acute phase, gradually show a lack of subjective symptoms, so patients do not feel any pain and tend to treat it lightly. However, once they exert themselves or after sexual activity, it recurs. Furthermore, in many cases, gonorrhea bacteria cannot be detected even with prostatic massage because the gonorrhea bacteria have penetrated deep into the interior of the glands and cannot be forced out by massage.</p>
<p>Taking Advantage of the Opportunity to Make Trouble, Suspicious and Fearful</p>
<p>Since gonorrhea bacteria cannot be forced out by general surgery, they often come out to take advantage of the opportunity to make trouble, making people suspicious and fearful, unclear about the situation, and randomly trying injections and medications, making it even more difficult to subdue the gonorrhea bacteria. After I always use microscopes and other methods to check the condition, I use German static electricity therapy and X-ray electrotherapy. The electric heat power can penetrate the small glands of the prostate. I also administer the gonorrhea remedy "Ke Lin Nong" as an internal medicine to resist gonorrhea phagocytes, which has an even greater effect and can often be cured in a short period of time, eliminating the root of recurrence. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 patients will be seen each day, with a registration fee of only five jiao per number.</p>

<h3>The Crisis and Rescue of Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Huang Zhongchang</p>
<p>Purulent Discharge Emphasizes Radical Cure; Complications Must Be Considered Simultaneously</p>
<p>International Medical Conference Points Out the Right Path for Treatment!</p>
<p>The rampant spread of gonorrhea is indeed related to economics. Therefore, the recession is sweeping across the entire land. When people are panicking about bread, who has the ability to support a wife? Therefore, under the capitalist system, humanity deeply feels the threat of economic panic. Marriage can only be enjoyed by the wealthy class. For some vast impoverished masses or petty bourgeoisie, marriage can only be regarded as a special right.</p>
<p>However, people in the wealthy class are no different physiologically. They also demand the comfort of the opposite sex. Therefore, prostitution has become a common phenomenon in society. It is no wonder that gonorrhea, caused by prostitution, is becoming increasingly prevalent. According to research by renowned scholars, the most terrifying crisis for people suffering from syphilis, regardless of gender, is periostitis and arthritis, which often cause limb deformities and hunchbacks. Secondly, the gonorrhea poison further enters the bone marrow, which can lead to sudden death! Especially when it causes meningitis, it is extremely dangerous. Regarding the treatment of gonorrhea, according to a world-renowned paper published in 1932 by Mr. Ke Luman, an expert in gonorrhea: "Providing a Special Therapy for Gonorrhea," in addition to stating that "Ke Lin Nong" must be taken for gonorrhea, it also pointed out that "Ke Lin Nong" is made by Dr. Peter of Germany using a mixture of protein and yellow pigment based on non-specific therapy. Its sterilization and anti-gonorrhea power can reach all cells, so systemic gonorrhea infection, arthritis, etc., cannot be conquered without "Ke Lin Nong." Therefore, all other new and old cases of purulent discharge await the treatment of "Ke Lin Nong" before they can be cured radically, and the use of "Ke Lin Nong" for gonorrhea has become a widespread phenomenon among clinicians in various countries! Since I returned to China from the United States, I have cured countless cases of gonorrhea with "Ke Lin Nong," and the reason why other outdated over-the-counter medicines are no match for "Ke Lin Nong" is entirely due to the remarkable efficacy of this agent.</p>
<h3>Several Points to Note in the Treatment of Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>— German Medical Doctor Zheng Ting</p>
<p>In order to cure seminal emission, in addition to drug therapy, the following points must also be noted:</p>
<p>You must get out of bed immediately upon awakening in the morning; do not delay. Before going to bed, do five minutes of indoor and outdoor exercises to tire your muscles and bones, making it easier to fall asleep. Places where men and women mingle, such as theaters, dance halls, and amusement parks, should be avoided. Young women should be seen less. Do not talk about trivial matters between men and women. Do not read obscene novels; read biographies of great people and books on self-cultivation and morality. Exercise and take suburban trips in your spare time to breathe fresh air. Sleep on your side with your knees bent. Therefore, hygienists say: "Sleep on your side and bend your knees, wake up straight and stretch; this method not only stops seminal emission but is also a wonderful method for nourishing life." If you have an urgent need to urinate in the middle of the night, you should get up and excrete it, otherwise, a full bladder will compress the seminal vesicle and easily cause seminal emission. Bedding should not be too soft but should be moderate. Abstain from irritating substances such as tobacco and alcohol, and then take the seminal emission medicine "Nai Er Si Seminal Emission Tablets" to stop seminal emission. If you also take the male "Bu Ti Kang," a genuine male animal testicular essence preparation invented by Dr. Mei Lun, a German endocrine expert, the effect will be even better. This has long been proven clinically.</p>
<h3>US Increases Aircraft Production, Aiding Democratic Nations to Expand Air Force, Roosevelt's Remarks Concealing from People's Eyes, German Newspaper Says White House Mysterious and Elusive</h3>
<p>(Washington) Today, as the Senate leader seeks to support President Roosevelt's foreign policy, people here have received reports that American aircraft manufacturers may supply 1,350 military aircraft to Britain and France within a few months. As Roosevelt and isolationist senators are about to fight each other over the secret of selling aircraft to Britain and France, the British Air Ministry has added 250 Lockheed reconnaissance aircraft and 400 North American training aircraft to its purchase. The French Aviation Association has also authorized negotiations to purchase 700 American fighter jets. At the same time, Senate Democratic Leader Barkley announced that he would convene the Senate Guidance and Policy Committee next week to discuss the debate on foreign policy. The House Military Affairs Committee is drafting a plan to limit the annual increase of new aircraft to 1,000 until a new proposal to increase it to 6,000. Members of the committee said that this gradual increase can also allow American aircraft factories to follow the technological development of the aircraft manufacturing industry. Democratic Senator Le An today defended the government's policy of selling military aircraft to Britain and France. He said that the large-scale purchase of American aircraft by European democratic countries can help American aircraft factories prepare for mass production, which is necessary for Roosevelt's defense program. He said, "We are not yet prepared for war. For example, Germany manufactures 1,200 aircraft per month with eight-hour shifts. We can manufacture 3,600 aircraft per month with a 24-hour work plan." (American Associated Press, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French "Listener Weekly" yesterday published detailed and accurate figures on France's purchase of aircraft from the United States in its publication. It is said that the American aircraft purchased include the following three types: 200 "Curtiss" destroyers with a flight speed of 450 kilometers per hour; 200 "North American" reconnaissance aircraft; 450 super "Douglas" aircraft with a maximum speed of 580 kilometers per hour. It is heard that the shipment will arrive in France at the beginning of this year. (Haitong Telegraph, 5th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After British Air Minister Sir Wood formally announced that the country had increased its order for aircraft from American factories from 400 to 650, Lieutenant Colonel Johnson, Under Secretary of the Army, recently made a statement to the press, explaining that these aircraft are not the latest types made in the United States. "Anyone can purchase the aircraft that Britain has increased in the American market," he said. Others responsible said that the British authorities believed that the quality of the destroyers they manufactured was better than those made in the United States, and they were not interested in American destroyers. (Havas Telegraph, 4th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) President Roosevelt's admission that he had told the Senate Military Affairs Committee that the American border was now behind France. A German newspaper doubted the truthfulness of this denial. A newspaper said that the US president's statement was not an admission but was intended to conceal it from the American people. President Roosevelt is temporarily retreating now, but he will never change his policy or abandon his views. An official article satirized the US president's admission, saying that this only reminded people of the mysterious and elusive spokesman in the White House during President Coolidge's tenure. (Reuters, 5th)</p>
<p>(Rome) American newspapers revealed that President Roosevelt estimated that democratic countries and dictatorial countries would inevitably have a war. After three days, Roosevelt admitted it. Italian evening newspapers unanimously believed that the admission was too late. Some even said that Roosevelt was afraid of the anger of American public opinion and had to eat his words to appease public anger. Others used dangerous words to intimidate Roosevelt, saying that Roosevelt's alarmist talk would provoke dictatorial countries to take self-defense actions. (Haitong Telegraph, 5th)</p>

<h3>Dutch Oil King Passed Away the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>Lifelong Hard Work and Labor, the Secret to His Success</p>
<p>Saint Moritz. Sir Deterding, the Dutch "Oil King," passed away here today at the age of 72. According to reports, the knight came from a poor background and lost his mother at the age of six. At the age of sixteen, he applied to the famous Amsterdamsche Bank in Amsterdam and was accepted, becoming the bank's youngest employee. After serving for six years, he felt that the opportunity for promotion was very slim, so he went to the Dutch East Indies to seek development, where he obtained a position at the Netherlands Trading Society. He then went east to Delhi to work as a bookkeeper for the branch of the society. The duties were heavy, but he was able to organize them well, and he was appreciated by the manager for eight years. In 1896, he recommended himself to the Royal Dutch Oil Company, and within just one year, he was promoted to assistant manager. In 1901, he was promoted to any manager position, and one year later, he leaped to become the general manager of the world's largest company. The knight then organized the Anglo-Dutch Oil Industry Federation, so that 40,000 people worked under him, including more than 6,000 in Britain. In 1920, he was awarded the title of knight for his contributions to industry. In 1928, he received an honorary doctorate in engineering from Delft University. In 1933, he publicly advocated that the Netherlands abandon the gold standard, which greatly surprised the Dutch financial community. The knight's fame was due to his superior talent and hard work, which was also an important factor. The knight liked sports. When he lived here, he often played water skiing with his youngest daughter. On that day, physical exercise was of great help to hard work and contemplation. (Reuters, 4th)</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army in Luhe Besieged in an Isolated City, the Chinese Army Wins a Fierce Battle in Suqian, Japanese Casualties Exceed Two Thousand, Defenses Consolidated in the Huaihai Area</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: After the Japanese army invaded Suining and Suqian, one force occupied Shunheji by the Bo River, attempting to advance east towards Shuyang and open up the Haizheng Highway. Another force, along the west bank of the Grand Canal, seized Buzi Ji and Yanghe, attempting to disrupt the heartland of northern Jiangsu. Fortunately, the Chinese army fought bravely, and Heaven blessed Huaihai. In the battle to take Suqian, 98 Japanese automobiles were destroyed, and Japanese casualties exceeded 2,000. Good news from Yanghe and Buzi Ji arrived frequently, with countless enemy captured. The Xuzhou Japanese army suffered heavy losses, their morale shattered, and they dared not act recklessly again. Therefore, they ordered the Japanese army in Yangzhou and Pukou to attack Luhe, which was isolated in the northwest. After fierce resistance from the Chinese army, they suffered heavy casualties. At the end of their strength, they were helpless, and could only be besieged in an isolated city. Having exhausted their resources and facing a dead end, the Japanese army had no other choice but to hire bandits to try to achieve their aims. Their exhaustion and decline can be imagined. The Xuzhou Japanese army, after searching high and low for bandits and providing them with supplies and weapons, planned to advance eastward along the damaged Longhai Railway in three routes: south, central, and north. The central and northern routes made no progress due to the tight Chinese army deployments. Only the southern route took the opportunity to infiltrate Yaowan, Suqian. The Japanese army, believing they had an opportunity, urgently mobilized all their remaining forces and concentrated them in Suqian, attacking Zhuojia Wei, Buzi Ji, and Jin Suo Zhen in three directions, hoping to revive their fortunes and reverse the decline. However, before the day was over, in the battle of Zhuojia Wei, nine out of ten Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded. In the battle of Buzi Ji, the Japanese army was ambushed by guerrillas during their retreat, and almost all were killed or wounded. In the battle of Jin Suo, more than 200 Japanese and puppet soldiers were captured, and more than 280 rifles were seized. At the end of last month, the Chinese army defeated them and pursued them in victory, successively recovering Jin Suo Zhen, Buzi Ji, and Jietou Ji. They then attacked Yaowan, killing more than 200 Japanese soldiers and wounding even more, capturing more than 180 alive, and seizing countless military supplies. Yaowan was also recovered. The Chinese army, having repeatedly captured important towns, had their morale boosted a hundredfold. This major victory in Suqian and Si County is the most significant battle since the fall of Xuzhou, demonstrating the courage of the Chinese army. The Japanese army's attempt to assist Suqian was completely defeated, and their plot to use bandits to create chaos was also foiled. However, the bandits and puppet troops north of the Longhai Railway still need to be severely suppressed. The remaining enemy troops in Suqian and Suining are still putting up a last-ditch resistance. The Chinese army, not complacent in victory or discouraged by defeat, is steadily and surely accumulating small victories to achieve a major victory, with the heroic and firm determination to defend the country and comfort the great hope of the people of northern Jiangsu.</p>
<h3>Puppet Governors of Jiangsu Province Perform a Bizarre Spring Welcoming Play</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: In the feudal era, during the Lichun Festival in the lunar calendar, local officials welcomed spring in the eastern suburbs. This system was abolished with the founding of the Republic of China. Only when Yuan Shikai proclaimed himself emperor in the fourth year of the Republic ordered the country to hold a spring greeting ceremony. Unexpectedly, this strange phenomenon has reappeared today. Chen Zemin, the puppet governor of Jiangsu Province, under the pretext of restoring the old ways, ordered the puppet counties and districts to resume the spring greeting ceremony yesterday (the Lichun Festival). An altar was set up before the god of agriculture and a spring ox, with offerings such as incense, candles, fruits, and wine. A master of ceremonies and several attendants were present. The puppet governor led the puppet officials, large and small, to the eastern suburbs. When Lichun arrived, the master of ceremonies announced the ceremony. The puppet governor led the way, and the puppet officials followed in order. Then, the god of agriculture and the spring ox were carried in front with drums and music, and the puppet officials followed to welcome them into the city and placed them in the hall of the puppet government. The puppet officials stood around with colored sticks, and the musicians beat drums, striking the spring ox three times before retreating. The people of each county sneered at this bizarre play.</p>
<h3>Punan National Salvation Army Straightens Out Discipline and Organizes Patrol Teams</h3>
<p>Punan Correspondence: Ding Xisan, commander of the Eighth Detachment of the Punan Loyalty and National Salvation Army and concurrently commander of the Joint Defense, discovered that his troops were taking advantage of combat opportunities to harass the local population. Some bad elements were even engaging in extortion and blackmail. Therefore, he organized a patrol team to conduct thorough investigations. Those with more serious offenses were immediately executed by firing squad. In recent days, in Ruan Xiang, Hu Jia Qiao, Cao Jing, and other unit headquarters, many people have been found and severely punished. Two battalion commanders were also involved in a case of robbery and murder of the victim. Commander Ding personally interrogated them and executed them on the spot, greatly pleasing the people. The detachment has more than 4,000 soldiers. Some of them are stationed in Maqiao, Tongqiao in the Shanghai County area of ​​northern Pudong, and the Shanghai Middle School area. Ding disguised himself and went to give a speech the other day. He paid particular attention to the discipline of each unit headquarters and issued creeds to be followed. At the same time, Ding mobilized the three major battalions there and attacked the Japanese army base in Shanghai Middle School from Tongqiao. A fierce battle ensued. The Japanese army used the school building as cover. The Chinese troops then charged from the rear with hand grenades. When they approached the school building, they used fire. The Japanese army was attacked from both sides and suffered heavy losses.</p>
<h3>Dark and Bleak Jiaxing: Heavy Taxes and Forced Conscription, People Scattered</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Correspondence: Since the establishment of the puppet government in Jiaxing, the tyranny it has imposed has caused the people to suffer deeply. The recent situation is reported below:</p>
<p>Implementing Prostitution: The puppet government believes that the policy of poisoning the minds of the youth is not enough to erode their ambitions, so it has formulated a plan to implement public prostitution. This will not only increase revenue but also ingratiate itself with the Japanese. Therefore, it resolutely implemented it on the first day of the month. The general methods for implementing public prostitution are as follows: all brothels with prostitutes must register with the puppet police station and obtain a license. Once registered, brothels must pay monthly donations in four grades: A, B, C, and D. Grade A pays ten yuan per month, Grade B pays eight yuan, Grade C pays five yuan, and Grade D pays two yuan. In addition, each brothel is required to send a prostitute to a specific brothel every day for the Japanese to rape, etc.</p>
<p>Forced Collection of Land Taxes: The puppet government has been collecting land taxes for three months, but very few people have paid according to the puppet regulations. Although drums have been beaten to urge payment, the people are unwilling to pay taxes, resulting in little effect. Recently, as the end of the lunar year approaches, various outstanding debts need to be settled. Therefore, the puppet government has hired local thugs and ruffians to station themselves at key checkpoints, waiting for wealthy households. If they are encountered, regardless of gender, age, or status, they will be detained and sent to the specially made detention center of the puppet government to force payment. As of when this reporter left Hecheng, it was reported that more than 200 men and women had been detained, most of whom were from middle-class families. Among them, a Mr. Wu, who had just returned to He from Shanghai, was planning to borrow some money from tenant farmers in the countryside due to living difficulties. However, as soon as he got off the bus, he was arrested and transferred to the Japanese Military Police Headquarters for detention on the grounds of secretly hiding weapons. Mr. Wu's relatives then managed to secure his release for a bribe of 1,000 yuan and ordered him to pay the land taxes before he was allowed to leave He.</p>
<p>Forcing Pawnshops to Open: The puppet government, in order to falsely promote the market, requires each pawnshop to restore its business, but each pawnshop said that all of the items it had possessed had been stolen by other people who are directing the theft of everything. It is not possible to go back to business. However, the puppet government ignored everything and forced the pawnshops to resume business within a time limit. If they dare to refuse, the puppet government will confiscate the property of each pawnshop. According to the leader of the pawn industry, regarding the issue of resuming business, they are unwilling to do so until the Japanese troops withdraw. If the puppet government wants to confiscate the stolen items, they will let it happen. It is also reported that the puppet government has decided that if the pawnshops continue to refuse, the puppet government will raise funds to open its own pawnshops and decide to specialize in pawning jewelry and valuable leather clothing at low prices and high interest rates.</p>
<p>Enticing Conscription: The Japanese military in this area ordered the puppet government to conduct a census last year and start conscription, causing the youth in the area to flee to the countryside to temporarily avoid it or join the guerrilla forces. Therefore, the conscription efforts could not be implemented. However, recently, Inatsune Minoru, the chief of the Japanese Comfort Corps, after receiving instructions from the commander of Central China to conscript 100,000 conscripts in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, consulted with Shen Hanqing, the puppet governor. They decided to entice the youth in the area to join under the name of organizing a puppet self-defense corps, and then have the Japanese army transfer them to other places for unit training. It is reported that this measure will be implemented at the beginning of next month.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Provincial Party Department Promotes Culture in the War Zone</h3>
<p>Jinhua Correspondence: In order to promote cultural work in the guerrilla areas, the persons in charge of the Zhejiang Provincial Party Department and the Zhejiang Provincial Wartime Education and Culture Affairs Committee specially sent Wu Yifei, the chief of the Propaganda Section of the Provincial Party Department, to western Zhejiang to plan. Wu crossed the river a month ago and went to Jiaxing, Pinghu, Haiyan, Haining and other four counties to plan cultural work and establish a cultural network. Under the Anti-Japanese and National Salvation Committee of Jiaxing and Haining counties, wartime education and cultural affairs committees were established. In addition, in the places he visited, he gathered youths with higher levels of local knowledge and organized cultural groups. Their task was, on the one hand, to distribute various books and newspapers imported from the rear, and on the other hand, to collect cultural information, such as Japanese atrocities, the ugly behavior of traitors, and the heroic stories of the military and civilians fighting against Japan, and supply it to the rear. Wu has completed his work in western Zhejiang and returned to the province a few days ago to report on the truth of western Zhejiang and the progress of the work, and has drafted a plan for promoting cultural work in the guerrilla war zone in the future, and is preparing to promote it jointly by both the department and the committee in the short term.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Japanese Plunder of Central China's Economy in Full View</h3>
<p>— Gu Xiaohui</p>
<p>The Japanese are now actively engaged in economic aggression within the occupied areas of Central China. They are organizing the so-called "Central China Revitalization Company," targeting "one company per industry" to establish various subsidiaries. These subsidiaries aim to monopolize all aspects of Central China's economy, including agriculture, production expansion, industry, transportation, and electricity. Their goal is to seize the entire economic power within the war zone in their dealings with China; to exclude international interests in China; and for themselves, to exploit the people's economy and extend it to China. In short, they aim to extract the economy of the occupied areas to compensate for Japan's financial deficiencies, to pursue their long-term war against China, and to completely shift the support of the Japanese army in China onto the Chinese people. This can be seen in the recent remarks made by Itagaki in response to parliamentarians.</p>
<p>I will now describe the methods of economic aggression used by the Japanese in Central China, the organization of various aggressive agencies, and the state of various industries in Central China under occupation. This is based on my own investigations as a reporter and records from Chinese, English, and Japanese newspapers. I have written this piece to allow everyone to see the full picture of Japan's economic aggression in Central China, to make our people aware of this forceful and domineering behavior, and to show that as long as we do not yield, no matter what they do, there will eventually be a day when we recover our lost possessions.</p>
<p>1. The So-Called "Central China Revitalization Company" (?)</p>
<p>In the Northeast, we know that Japan had a so-called "South Manchuria Railway Company" (Mantetsu), which the Japanese themselves called the vanguard of their invasion of the mainland. After 1918, within a few years, all sorts of economic rights outside the customs had fallen into its hands. After August 13th, Japan adopted the same policy, and on November 7th of last year, it established two new companies. One was the so-called "North China Development Company" for North China, and the other was the so-called "Central China Revitalization Company" for Central China. These two organizations, like Mantetsu, are "national policy companies" recognized by the Japanese government. This article will focus solely on the "Central China Revitalization Company."</p>
<p>The "Central China Revitalization Company" was established based on a resolution passed by the 73rd Japanese Diet on April 28th of last year. After its establishment in Tokyo on November 7th of last year, the head office was said to be located in Shanghai (but this has not yet materialized). The company's capital is 100 million Japanese yen, half of which is contributed by the Japanese government and half by the private sector. Its first paid-in capital was 31,382,344 yen, divided as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Government -- 18,882,344 yen</p>
<p>In-Kind Contribution -- 7,640,000 yen</p>
<p>Cash -- 11,242,344 yen</p>
<p>Private Shares -- 12,500,000 yen</p>
<p>But it is pitiful to say that this private capital was raised over a long period of four months, divided into 100,000 shares, with as many as 9,770 shareholders participating, and the money raised was only a little over 12 million.</p>
<p>In addition to many subsidiaries, the company's organization is divided into three sections and one office, as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai Head Office</p>
<p>Subsidiaries General Affairs Section Business Section Business Investigation Section Tokyo Branch Office</p>
<p>The key responsible person, the president, is appointed by the Japanese government and is Kodama Kenji. This old man was the Japanese chairman of the so-called Sino-Japanese Trade Association before the war. We should all remember how he came to Shanghai a few years ago, toasting and singing about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation at the International Hotel! Now the fox's tail is showing. It turns out that so-called "cooperation" is this kind of cooperation. Anyone who is still dreaming of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation should wake up. Now let us list the important responsible persons of this company:</p>
<p>President Kodama Kenji (former General Manager of Yokohama Specie Bank)</p>
<p>Vice President Hirasawa Yō (former Vice Minister of Communications)</p>
<p>Director Kanai Kiyoshi (former South Manchuria Railway Company Specialist)</p>
<p>Sonoda Saburō (former Foreign Exchange Section of Yokohama Specie Bank)</p>
<p>Aburatani Kyō (former Director of the Sino-Japanese Industrial Association)</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the establishment of this company is actually a general mechanism for exploiting Japanese private capital and representing the Japanese government's economic aggression against China, with its subsidiaries implementing the aggression. The establishment of subsidiaries follows the principle of "one company per industry." No matter what the industry, it is controlled by the company in that industry. The aim is to control the entire industrial and commercial hub of Central China, exclude European and American interests in China, and turn China into its economic dependency, like an ancient serf, forever unable to enter the gateway of modern industry.</p>
<p>Details about the subsidiaries' control of various industries will be written later. Now let's talk about the activities of Kodama Kenji, the mastermind of the company.</p>
<p>After the establishment of the "Central China Revitalization Company," Kodama Kenji gave an interview to a Reuters reporter in Tokyo, wanting to attract British and American investment in its controlled areas. Therefore, I recognize control and monopoly. First, Kodama said, "The company is not controlled by the army and is purely commercial in nature." This is all a lie. It is clearly one of Japan's "national policy companies" towards China. Kodama himself was appointed by the Japanese government. According to Tokyo's own account, the Japanese government has the power to supervise the company, the power to cancel the company's resolutions, the power to appoint and dismiss the company's responsible persons, and the power to issue various necessary orders for national defense or other necessities. This is enough to show that what Kodama said is all false. In fact, this company is a representative of the Japanese government, and the responsible persons inside are the lackeys of the warlords. Second, he said, "The company has no intention of monopolizing." This is even more of a lie. Looking at "Mantetsu" in the Northeast, it has now completely excluded all international interests in "Manchukuo." Looking at North China, the control of cotton is nominally by a puppet organization, but in reality, isn't it this so-called "North China Development Company"? Furthermore, in the shipping routes in Shanghai and inland rivers, since the establishment of the Japanese "Inland River Steamship Company," it has been completely monopolized. The "Inland River Steamship Company" is a subsidiary of this company. Foreign shipping companies have even negotiated with the Japanese for permits to navigate the inland rivers, but to no avail. There are many other industries like this. Isn't it enough to prove its control? At the same time, Japanese newspapers invariably acknowledge that the policy will henceforth center on controlling China's industrial and commercial enterprises. Second, Kodama also said, "Shanghai is much more prosperous. Japanese commerce is developing accordingly, and there is no reason why foreign commerce should not expand." This is their attempt to lure Europe and America to invest in Central China and complete their development conspiracy. However, all parties remained indifferent to Kodama's remarks. He left Tokyo to operate in Shanghai in this situation.</p>
<p>Kodama arrived in Shanghai on the Miyazaki Maru on November 26th of last year, accompanied by the company's Vice President Hirazawa and directors. They held so-called Sino-Japanese economic cooperation meetings with the puppets in Hongkou, including:</p>
<p>Strategies for expanding the revitalization company;</p>
<p>Establishment of a Sino-Japanese Bank.</p>
<p>Issuance of counterfeit currency.</p>
<p>Promotion of military scrip.</p>
<p>Other control matters.</p>
<p>On November 30th, he went from Shanghai to Nanjing to discuss cooperation methods with the highest Japanese military commander. He also convened a meeting in Nanjing with the puppet governors of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to discuss their so-called "cooperation" methods, which in reality was just asking a few puppets what things they had that could be plundered! Kodama is said to reside in Shanghai for a long time, but his plan to establish a Sino-Japanese Bank and issue counterfeit currency failed due to the righteous refusal of Chinese and foreign banks. As for the promotion of military scrip, after he arrived in Nanjing, he had already agreed with the Japanese side, and it was implemented on November 30th of last year. That is, issuing new military scrip in the occupied areas to replace bank notes and using worthless paper to buy goods is a policy of plunder.</p>
<p>2. Establishment of Various Control Companies</p>
<p>Regarding the various subsidiaries established by the Japanese to control various industries, many companies had already been established under the "request" of the Japanese army before the "Central China Revitalization Company" was established and before Kodama came to Shanghai. Later, when the "Revitalization Company" was established, the various companies became its subsidiaries. After Kodama came to China, several new ones were established.</p>
<p>To control inland river navigation, the "Shanghai Inland River Steamship Company" was established on July 28th of last year with a capital of 2 million Japanese yen. Of this, 600,000 yen was contributed by the Japanese "Central China Revitalization Company," and 400,000 yen by the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, totaling 1 million yen. The remaining 1 million yen was used to seize Chinese assets, valued at 1 million, as capital. The company uses the name of controlling inland river routes in Central China. It currently has 75 steamships and 70 barges. All important inland river routes in Central China are exclusively licensed to the company.</p>
<p>On July 31st of last year, the "Central China Electric Communication Co., Ltd." was established with a capital of 15 million Japanese yen. Of this, 6 million was contributed by the "Central China Revitalization Company," 2 million by the International Electric Communication Company, 1 million by the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation, and 1 million jointly by the Nippon Electric Company, Sumitomo Electric Industries, Furukawa Electric, Fujikura Electric Wire, and Oki Electric. This totals 10 million, and the remaining 5 million is used to seize various original telecommunications equipment and industries in Central China, converted into capital. The company operates Central China's telegraph, telephone, and external wireless communication businesses. All wired and wireless telegraphs and telephones between cities such as Shanghai, Suzhou, Nanjing, and Hangzhou are controlled and operated. It also plans to expand wireless telecommunications to Southeast Asia, Europe, and the United States, and submarine telegraphs to North China. Long-distance telephone lines between Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou, and wireless telephones between Shanghai and Tokyo have been connected.</p>
<p>On June 30th of last year, the "Central China Hydroelectric Power Joint Venture" was established, with 3 million yen contributed by Japan Iron &amp; Steel Engineering Co. And 2.5 million yen jointly contributed by Tsurumi Steel, Ogura Steel, Nakayama Steel Works, and Sino-Japanese Industrial Company. The remaining 10 million is used to seize mineral resources from about 20 iron ore areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, converted into half of the capital.</p>
<p>Its plan is to first steal ore from the Taochong iron ore area between Nanjing and Wuhu, and between Taiping and Tongling. The Taiping iron ore is the target for preliminary mining. The first-year plan is to mine 1 million tons of iron ore. Mining has already begun in Aotushan and Nanshan. The current daily average is 500 tons of iron ore mined. On October 26th of last year, the first ship of 7,000 tons was shipped from Ma'anshan, the second ship of 3,000 tons was shipped on the 31st, and the third ship was shipped in November, all to Japan.</p>
<p>To start long-distance bus services in the occupied areas of Central China, the "Central China Urban Public Automobile Co., Ltd." was established on November 5th of last year. The head office is located in Shanghai, with a capital of 3 million Japanese yen. Of this, 2.5 million was jointly contributed by the Xingzhong Company, Dazhi Automobile Company, and Jiangnan Industrial Company, with half paid in advance. The remaining 500,000 is supplemented by seized Chinese real estate.</p>
<p>The company's business scope covers the seven cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and Zhenjiang, specializing in urban public bus services, as well as intercity long-distance buses and truck transportation. Within the Shanghai Suzhou Hebei concessions, it also seizes the exclusive rights granted by the Public Concession authorities to the British-owned China General Omnibus Company, and operates public buses in areas where roads are built across the border. Another company will be established to specifically operate long-distance bus services.</p>
<p>To control the agricultural and industrial production of silkworm eggs, silk, and silk factories in Central China, the "Central China Silk Co., Ltd." was established. The head office is located in Shanghai, established on August 10th of last year, with a capital of 8 million Japanese yen (Japanese sources say 10 million Japanese yen, but either way, it's bragging, so it doesn't matter). Of this, 6 million was contributed by the "Central China Revitalization Company," with half paid in advance, and an estimated 2 million Japanese yen in seized Central China silk factory assets is used to supplement the capital.</p>
<p>The company's objectives:</p>
<p>Operating machine silk reeling business. Operating the production and distribution of silkworm eggs. Operating the silk hand-reeling industry. Buying and selling native silk. Conducting matters related to the above items. At the same time, Wang Zihui, the "responsible person" of the puppet "Renovation Government," sold silk factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Huzhou, Jiaxing, Hai'ning, and Deqing to the Japanese when he went to Japan, and signed the conditions they desired with the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry:</p>
<p>(A) The production of silkworm cocoons in Central China must be increased to the level before the war. The number of silk reeling basins shall be limited to about 10,000. (B) The reeling and distribution of silk cocoons shall be managed by the "Central China Silk Company." (C) Japanese silk factories shall specialize in reeling the superior grades of silk, 20 to 22 denier, and 13 to 15 denier, while Chinese silk factories shall specialize in the coarse silk of 20 to 22 denier. (D) Select special silkworm cocoons for use in North China and Japan. (E) The inspection and control of raw silk exports from North China shall be handled by the "Central China Revitalization Company."</p>
<p>(F) Hand-reeled silk should be encouraged, and efforts should also be made to promote new uses for silkworm cocoons. In the future, another company will be established to manage the production of special dried cocoons. (G) The same policy as in Central China will be adopted for the sericulture industry in Shandong.</p>
<p>On December 28th of last year, the "Central China Gas Co., Ltd." was established. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 3 million yuan. Of this, 2.5 million yuan was contributed by the "Central China Revitalization Company," Shanghai Permanent Properties Company, Hiroshima Gas Co., Ltd., Tokyo Gas Chemical Industry Co., etc., with one-fourth paid in advance, and seized property from [China], converted into 500,000 yuan, to fill the remaining shares. The leading figures of the company: Managing Director is Toyoshima Akemi (former Director of Hiroshima Gas Electric Railway Co., Ltd.), Director Chen Shaowei (Managing Director of Shanghai Permanent Properties Company), Ishikura Kichiji (former Managing Director of Tokyo Gas Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.), Supervisor Fei Mingyu.</p>
<p>To control shipping on the Yangtze River, the "Yangtze River Shipping Company" was established on December 10th of last year. The head office is located in Shanghai, and it has not yet started business. The amount of capital is unknown, and it is invested by the "Central China Revitalization Company" and Nisshin Steamship Co., Ltd., Daewoo Steamship Co., etc., and seizes Chinese shipping company wharves along the Yangtze River as capital to monopolize all shipping in the ports of the Yangtze River, and has 16 river vessels, excluding British shipping.</p>
<p>To seize Shanghai real estate, the so-called "Revitalization War Zone," the "Shanghai Permanent Properties Company" was established on September 1st of last year. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 2 million yuan, of which 1 million yuan was contributed by the "Central China Revitalization Company," using public land of the former Shanghai Municipal Government, etc., converted into 1 million yuan, to fill half of the capital. It is said that the company will start from Shanghai, planning to build urban areas, roads, harbors, etc., to transform Shanghai and control the concessions.</p>
<p>To seize fish production along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, the "Central China Aquatic Products Co., Ltd." was established on November 6th of last year. The head office is located in Shanghai with a capital of 1.33 million yen, of which 1 million was from the "Central China Revitalization Company," and the remaining 330,000 was from seizing the Shanghai fish market industry, etc., converted to supplement the capital. The company operates wholesale markets for aquatic products and sales businesses, and engages in fishing with fishing boats and nets, as well as cold storage transportation and other businesses.</p>
<p>On July 25th of last year, the "Shanghai Fish Market Association" was established with a capital of 100,000 yuan, and it is one and the same with the "Central China Aquatic Products Co., Ltd." to monopolize the local fish industry.</p>
<p>As for other aspects that have been controlled in Central China but have not yet established agencies, such as railways, the Beijing-Shanghai, Shanghai-Hangzhou, Suzhou-Jiaxing, and Jiangnan railways are being repaired by engineers sent by the Japanese Military Railway Department, the Japanese Railway Department, and the South Manchuria Railway Company, and will be operated by the "Central China Revitalization Company." Coal mines: plans to mine the Huainan coal mine, Changxing coal mine, etc. The Zhongxing coal has already begun to be shipped to Japan. Wireless broadcasting: the "Greater Shanghai" and "Greater East" have been established, and puppet organizations are planned to control Shanghai Chinese radio stations. For tobacco, there are the Toyo Leaf Tobacco Company, the East Asia Tobacco Company, and the Gong Sheng Tobacco Company, etc., seizing Chinese cigarette factories. In terms of agricultural products, agencies have been established in the interior to control purchases. For example, for cotton, the Japanese Merchants' Association in China and the Chinese traitor organization Citizen's Association jointly established a control agency in Shanghai, and after obtaining a purchase certificate from the Japanese military, they dispatched personnel to establish offices in various counties to control purchases and prohibit "private sales." All flower collection offices established by Chinese merchants in the interior have been forced to withdraw. For example, rice is purchased in Songjiang, Wuxi, Changshu, Suzhou, etc., and shipped for export, totaling no less than several million dan. Shipbuilding: the Japanese Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Corporation seized the Jiangnan Shipyard of the Navy Department to repair warships, and occupied the machinery of the Sanbei Hongchang and Hexing factories. The Japanese army occupied the Pudong Laogong Mao and Dinghai Bridge Da Zhonghua factories, and Nisshin occupied the machinery of the Caili Longchang Hengchang Xiang Hongxiang Xing Zhao Shang Nehe five factories. Cement, textiles, flour, etc., have all been seized separately by the Japanese under the instigation of the Japanese army.</p>
<p>3. Links with Japanese Trading Companies</p>
<p>The various subsidiaries mentioned above are direct agencies for plundering China. They are subordinate to the "Central China Revitalization Company," a "national policy company." The "Central China Revitalization Company," representing the Japanese official side, naturally participates in the organization of each subsidiary. The rest are jointly organized by Japanese merchants to plunder Chinese assets for their exploitation. These have already been mentioned above, and for the sake of clarity, a table is provided below:</p>
<p>4. Various Plundered Industries</p>
<p>Before the war, Chinese cotton mills in Central China had 1.38 million spindles and 14,700 looms. Currently, the Japanese have occupied and utilized 600,000 spindles, 5,300 looms, and a total of 37 factories.</p>
<p>Regarding the cement factories that have been seized, according to the Shanghai News Commercial News, of the ten Chinese cement factories in the country, only one remains in Chinese hands. The nine in the Japanese-occupied area have all been seized, including three in North China, two in South China, and four in Central China.</p>
<p>Central China is a sericulture production area, and the Japanese have long coveted it. In the past, when they could not obtain it, they repeatedly sold inferior silkworm eggs to our country in an attempt to harm it. After August 13th, the silk cocoon production areas in the Japanese-occupied areas of Central China, such as Shanghai, Wuxi, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Hai'ning, Deqing, etc., were all occupied. Since the establishment of the so-called "Central China Silk Company," all have been occupied and operated by it. The number of silk machines seized: 3 in Shanghai with 708 machines, 9 in Wuxi with 2,554 machines, 19 in Suzhou with 3,656 machines, and 22 in Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Huzhou, Hai'ning, etc. with 4,030 machines. There are more than 50 companies with 10,948 silk machines in total.</p>
<p>At the same time, the "Central China Silk Company" also occupied cocoon factories and silkworm egg production sites. In the occupied areas of Jiangsu Province, there are a total of 214, including 26 in Wuxian, 99 in Wuxi, 1 in Changshu, 2 in Wujiang, 1 in Kunshan, 1 in Taicang, 19 in Jiangyin, 20 in Wujin, 8 in Yixing, 3 in Jintan, 10 in Danyang, 10 in Liyang, 1 in Lishui, 1 in Dantu, 2 in Jurong, 5 in Yangzhong, and 2 in Jiangdu.</p>
<p>Among the flour mills in Central China that have been invaded and started by the Japanese, there are four in the Shanghai urban area, including the Fuxin No. 3 Mill, which have been invaded and operated by the "Japan Flour Milling Company" jointly run by Mitsui and Mitsubishi. There are five in Wuxi: Fuxin, Maoxin, Guangfeng, Guangdong, and Jiufeng. Among them, the Jiufeng mill is operated by the Japanese Yoshida, while the others are mostly operated by the "Japan Flour Milling Company." There is the Yangtze River Flour Mill in Nanjing, which is occupied and operated by the Japanese Sato Koichi.</p>
<p>The cigarette market in the guerrilla areas of Central China is completely controlled by the Japanese. Using military force, it prohibits Chinese cigarette merchants and British cigarette merchants from transporting into the interior, and sells inferior goods that are crudely made with tobacco obtained from the Wan Province and by seizing and occupying the Chinese cigarette factories in the occupied area and starting operations without paying taxes. Thus, this market is completely occupied.</p>
<p>There were more than a dozen paper mills in Nanshi, Pudong, Zhabei, and Yangshupu in Shanghai. Since the Chinese army retreated to the west, most of the factories have been occupied by the Japanese. The Japanese then attempted to lure the authorities of each factory to cooperate with the Japanese and resume operations, but the factory officials, with righteousness, were determined to sacrifice their small selves and unanimously refused. Seeing that the lure did not work, the Japanese occupied all the factory buildings and machinery, preparing to start operations.</p>
<p>In addition, there are still factories that have been seized by the Japanese, as seen in the Shanghai News Commercial News article "A Sad History of Chinese Industry and Commerce" (see the Shanghai News of October 27th of last year), and many factories have sent letters stating that they have not cooperated with the Japanese and that it is purely plunder.</p>
<p>5. A Final Thought</p>
<p>I have finished writing this article with the materials I have now obtained. Of course, we see that the huge people's industry has been plundered, and it is an undeniable loss. We also see the other party's sinister conspiracy within their so-called "Central China Revitalization Company." But we really don't need to be too terrified. We want to see what its capabilities are. And look at the capital of this "Central China Revitalization Company," nominally 100 million yen, but the first phase only collected 31,382,344 yen. Apart from the Japanese government's forced contribution of 18,882,344 yen (and only 11,242,344 yen in cash), the remaining private shares were only 12.5 million yen, and were raised over a long period of four months, divided into 100,000 shares, and raised from 9,770 people. This is a truly genuine fact that proves that their people are not interested in this. Moreover, many of the affairs developed in China are not only not beneficial to their domestic industry, but have also been affected by them. This has already been discovered. Therefore, we must see through this point, and hope that the authorities of our industries will earnestly implement holding the line, gritting our teeth, and sacrificing to the end. We must never be lured or threatened into cooperating with the Japanese puppets. In this way, let's see what the other party can do, and the industries you are currently occupying can be returned to Zhao Wanbi when the final victory comes.</p>
<p>Of course, we have also seen factory owners who upheld righteousness and firmly refused to "cooperate" (here I want to mention one, such as Ba Qingxiang, the factory owner of the Suzhou Dalong Iron Factory and the Sulun Yarn Factory, who was lured by the Japanese without success, and was arrested and threatened, but in the end he still firmly refused and went to the Southwest. This is a representative). But we have also seen many who willingly let themselves be used and cooperate with the other party, such as the silk factories in Wuxi, which are an example. (Here, the reporter also gives an example, that is, a nationally famous Nantong yarn factory actually willingly started operations in cooperation with the Japanese, and the Japanese flag and the five-color flag were flying on its roof. It provides hundreds of thousands to the other party every month. When the author went to visit the truth of the factory, a representative of the factory in Shanghai also acquiesced, saying: The factory is mortgaged to German merchants, so why not move it? Why provide the other party with huge sums of money? The person shook his head and smiled, seemingly indicating: The first point is that the procedures are too difficult, and the second point is because I still want to make a fortune.)</p>
<p>In addition to the above actions, we must also come up with active actions, which is what we hope for from the military and political organizations in the guerrilla areas. We must carry out destructive work, like the mineral production in Shanxi, to make it impossible to mine. Such destructive work does not have to be too great, but we must try to make it impossible to start work and excavation. We must make it so that the other party is not able to do it themselves, and cannot use others, and is also faced with all kinds of difficulties. In this way, let's see what they can do after they have captured it? (The End)</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: Pure Gold Slightly Weaker, Hechi Trading Not Yet Open</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the cash Hechi black market was quiet due to the Sunday holiday, with few people gathering. It was rumored that someone offered to sell at 2040 yuan, but buyers only bid 2037-2038 yuan, so no deals were made. Business at money exchange shops was also unusually sluggish. The exchange price for gold jewelry per tael at silver shops remained unchanged. Da Tong Hang, Lao Qingyun, and others still quoted the original price of 207 yuan, while new shops quoted 205 yuan for sales and 199 yuan for purchases. According to a London cable from the 4th, the price of British pure gold suddenly decreased by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7 8s 7½d.</p>
<h3>British and Indian Silver Prices Slightly Higher</h3>
<p>According to a London cable from the 4th, purchases by India and speculators, coupled with limited supply, kept the market calm. Large silver bars for both near and far terms rose by 0.0625. According to a New York silver cable, the American silver price remained unchanged. Also, a Bombay silver cable reported that the Indian silver market was calm, with both spot and near/far terms rising by one anna.</p>
<h3>Securities: Si Hai Shares Converted to British Gold, Fearnley &amp; Eger Shares Pay Dividends</h3>
<p>The British-owned Si Hai Insurance Company of this city passed a resolution at its extraordinary general meeting on December 27th of last year to convert the original total share capital of 2 million shares, with a face value of 5 taels of silver per share, to a total share capital of 933,323 shares, with a face value of 10 shillings of British gold per share. It was stipulated that 15 old shares denominated in silver could be exchanged for 7 new shares denominated in British gold. To prepare for the exchange process, share transfers were suspended from the 30th of last month to the 4th of this month.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Fearnley &amp; Eger Rubber Limited, managed by Bucknall &amp; Co. of this city, will pay a dividend for this term (November 1, 1937, to the end of October 1938) of 3 fen in national currency per share (face value of 1 yuan in national currency per share).</p>
<h3>Food: Japonica Rice Prices Unanimously Increased</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of domestic rice saw six boats arriving in Hexia, with only three to four thousand bags of Lunche baozi rice. The market continued to surge. The Rice Merchants Association has already resolved to close for business on the 14th of this month for a major inventory. As a result, shopkeepers on this street have mostly stocked up, and hoarders are also anxious, making the sales market even more active. At the same time, sellers are taking the opportunity to raise prices, creating an extremely tight situation. The market continues to rise, with the price of thick and thin Japonica rice increasing by 10-20 cents. Doyang sharp and But sharp followed suit. Yin Yuan good increased by 10-20 cents, while Bian Yuan, as a popular seasonal item, saw extensive sales, with prices increasing by 20 cents. Rumor has it that prices have already reached as high as 15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Both Coarse and Refined Sugar Tighten Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend of foreign sugar tightened again. The association's board quoted 24 Dutch cents for coarse white sugar, with spot prices rising by 20 cents to 24.10 yuan. Re-export goods rose another 10 cents, trading at 15.875 yuan before calling for 16 yuan. Taikoo refined white sugar for delivery at the wharf rose by 20 cents, quoted at 23.40 yuan, with over a hundred bags traded. The price of goods from our godown was 23.50 yuan, with other prices following suit. Several dozen bags of old Chen Chaoqing domestic sugar were offered at a price of 13.20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials: Job's Tears Market Weak</h3>
<p>Job's tears (also known as rice kernels) enjoyed brisk sales in the autumn and winter of last year, reaching a peak price of 38 yuan. Subsequently, the supply gradually increased, and merchants' inventories filled up daily, leading to a sluggish market with only sporadic transactions, falling by varying amounts of 2-3 yuan. Currently, a Hong Kong group is considering buying, contacting merchants for prices as low as 31-32 yuan, but sellers are still trying to hold on, resulting in a standoff. Large quantities might be released at 33-34 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Hard Lead Wire Soars</h3>
<p>Despite being the end of the year, hardware trading remains exceptionally active. Customers from Tianjin and Yantai are actively buying, and demand from Southeast Asia is also strong. Transactions on this street remain smooth, with the market offering 2-3 thousand dan of various goods. Among them, new lead wire, this factory's original nails, English steel plates, company iron, blue lead iron, new foreign ingots, triangular iron, white lead wire, and chimney iron are all being offered. Due to the tight exchange rate, prices have seen little change. However, hard lead wire, which has been weak for a long time, suddenly changed its appearance yesterday. Due to the market's supply not meeting demand, prices soared. Currently, number 12 is selling for 18 yuan per dan, up 1 yuan from the previous day. Number 12 is selling for 17.75 yuan, also up 25 cents. Numbers 14 and 15 are both selling for 18.25 yuan, an increase of 50 cents from the previous market. Although other varieties are being traded, the selling prices show little change. Investigations reveal that the spot supply of hard lead wire on the market is extremely limited, so holders are very firm in their thinking and unwilling to easily release their goods at a lower price in the future.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Qingdao Vermicelli Prices Increase</h3>
<p>Due to brisk sales, vermicelli has tightened again, causing Qingdao vermicelli prices to increase. Yesterday, the top Zhuang offered up to 49 yuan. Other goods from Longkou and Jiangbei saw little change.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Foreign Green Tea Trade Continues Smoothly</h3>
<p>Since the tea factories in this city started producing large quantities of rough tea for the market last week, foreign firms such as Jardine Matheson, Ewo, Gibb Livingston, and Tungfoo have successively started trading in Precious Eyebrow, Pearl Tea, Needle Eyebrow, and other varieties. No less than 700 boxes have been traded, all of which are top-grade Zhuang goods, and prices are quite firm. The transaction volume for last week is specially recorded below: Jardine Matheson bought a total of 324 boxes of ordinary Precious Eyebrow under the Extreme Peak brand, priced from 82 yuan to 108 yuan. Ewo bought 217 boxes of Cloud Mist Peak Precious Eyebrow, priced from 92 yuan to 120 yuan. Gibb Livingston bought 33 boxes of Rare Precious Eyebrow, priced at 105 yuan, and also bought 26 boxes of First Grade Fragrance Needle Eyebrow, priced at 75 yuan. Yau Kee bought 42 boxes of Huzhou Needle Eyebrow, priced at 65 yuan. Tungfoo and Wing Fat jointly bought 20 boxes of Wing Fang Precious Eyebrow, priced at 140 yuan, and also 16 boxes of Auspicious Shrimp Eye, priced at 85 yuan. The market continues to be smooth.</p>

<h3>Thirteen Types of Native Products Will Not Be Shipped to Shanghai Starting This Year; Foreign Sales Will Be Under the Control of the Trade Commission; Funds Will Be Allocated for Purchase and Centralized Export from Hong Kong and Kunming</h3>
<p>After the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance adjusted foreign trade, the overall trade deficit decreased and the export of native products increased. Starting this year, the implementation of control over 13 types of native products such as tung oil and tea will absolutely prohibit their transportation to Shanghai, and will be completely concentrated for export from Hong Kong and Kunming. Market prices will also be adjusted and native products will be purchased as much as possible. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Control of Foreign Trade in Native Products</p>
<p>The native products under the control of the Trade Commission are 13 categories including tung oil, pig bristles, tea, ore, medicinal materials, silk, sausage casings, hides, duck feathers, gourd seeds, wool, ramie, and cowhide. The export of the above native products must be settled in foreign exchange with the China and Communications Banks in accordance with the law, and they are specially allowed to be exported completely duty-free and absolutely prohibited from being re-exported to the occupied areas. Shanghai is designated as one of the occupied areas, so since New Year's Day this year, the 13 types of native products have stopped being transported to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Adjust Market Prices and Government Purchases</p>
<p>The Trade Commission has established offices in Zhejiang, Sichuan, Yunnan, Jiangxi, Fujian, and other provinces to make every effort to adjust the market prices of native products in order to maintain domestic production. Based on foreign market prices, the purchase prices of goods produced in the place of origin and their distribution market are determined. The committee will entrust the Central Trust Bureau, China Tea Company, China Vegetable Oil Company, and Fu Hua Company to purchase as much as possible. Merchants who wish to purchase native products must contact the committee in advance and follow the methods stipulated by the committee.</p>
<p>Native Product Exports Concentrated in Hong Kong and Kunming</p>
<p>The export of 13 types of native products will henceforth be concentrated in Hong Kong and Kunming. The Trade Commission will then load them onto ships and transport them to various countries. Regarding the purchase of native products, the Ministry of Finance has allocated 80 million yuan in national currency to the Trade Commission as a fund for purchasing native products. In addition, 10 million yuan in national currency has been allocated to the Central Trust Bureau to serve as a war risk fund when handling the transportation of native products. The insurance premiums for native products exported with the Trade Commission's certification are specially allowed to be recorded on account. If the goods are sold at a loss after the goods are sold, the insurance premiums will be waived and paid by the government.</p>
<p>Various Industries Contact and Operate Native Products</p>
<p>After the ban on tung oil, tea, etc. being transported to Shanghai, the Shanghai Foreign Tea Merchants Association has established offices in Hong Kong, Wenzhou, and Ningbo to contact the Trade Commission and purchase Zhejiang East Pingshui and Anhui Luzhuang green tea. Some of the association's member tea houses have moved to Hong Kong for transactions. As for the foreign firms that purchase Chinese tea, they have also sent personnel to Hong Kong to purchase and directly load them onto ships for transportation to various countries. Therefore, the transaction of Chinese tea will be completely transferred to Hong Kong in the future. As for the trade in tung oil, medicinal materials, and leather, etc., it has also successively moved to Hong Kong and Kunming.</p>
<p>Increase in Exports of Major Native Products</p>
<p>Last year's exports of native products: tung oil valued at 39.23 million yuan in national currency; tea valued at 14.29 million yuan in national currency; pig bristles valued at 28.06 million yuan in national currency; ore valued at 100.657 million yuan in national currency; medicinal materials valued at 4.98 million yuan in national currency; wool valued at 10.14 million yuan in national currency; ramie valued at 4.51 million yuan in national currency; silk valued at 37.51 million yuan in national currency; hides valued at 1.942 million yuan in national currency; duck feathers valued at 4.61 million yuan in national currency; sausage casings valued at 7.7 million yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>After the Hungarian Merchant Vessel Aida Was Detained, the Hungarian Government Protested to Japan; It Was Intercepted After Loading Cargo in Shanghai and Sailing to Wenzhou; It Has Now Been Detained in Xiamen for Monitoring</h3>
<p>The ADA, a gasoline ship of the Hungarian firm Komor &amp; Co., with a cargo capacity of 198 tons, was chartered by Wah Tai Co. to transport goods for customers. It once sailed between Shanghai and Changyinsha. Later, it changed its route to Shanghai-Wenzhou. On the 20th of last month, the gasoline ship loaded 1,000 empty diesel drums, 20 tons of coal, 20 tons of diesel, a small drilling machine, 20 iron sheets, and 40 passengers for customers and sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou. Suddenly, on the 22nd, it was detained by the Japanese on the Wenzhou sea. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the company yesterday that the shipowner, Norwegian Stein, had entrusted a Portuguese ship to cable Shanghai twice to report to the company. The first cable reported the detention situation, and the second requested reporting to the Hungarian government for negotiations. Currently, the Aida has been detained by the Japanese in Xiamen and is being monitored by the Japanese Navy in Xiamen. The company has now reported the detention incident to the Hungarian government. It is reported that the Hungarian government has lodged a protest with the Japanese side based on the report, demanding its prompt release.</p>
<h3>The Government Strives to Regulate Wartime Food Prices, Standardizing Market Prices, Exempting Re-export Taxes, and Circulating Domestic Food; Agricultural Warehouses Will Be Established in Various Provinces and Cities to Store Pledged Reserves for Prevention</h3>
<p>In order to regulate the surplus and deficiency of wartime food, standardize market prices, and promote agricultural warehouses, the Ministry of Economic Affairs promulgated the "Food Regulation Measures" and then promulgated the "Outline of Measures for Food Management in War Zones," making every effort to restrict the import of foreign rice and wheat and prohibit the export or re-export of grain and wheat to the occupied areas. At the same time, various provinces were ordered to increase food production and carry out grain storage. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Establish Agricultural Warehouses to Store and Pledge Food</p>
<p>The Agricultural Bank is actively organizing self-operated agricultural warehouses in important locations in the southwest and northwest provinces to operate food storage, pledge, and transportation and sales businesses. At the same time, the China Farmers Bank and provincial banks in various provinces have successively planned to establish new-style agricultural warehouses to handle food storage and pledge. In addition to carrying out grain storage in accordance with the "Outline of Measures for Local Warehouse Construction and Grain Storage" promulgated by the Ministry of Interior, the provincial governments also encouraged various people's organizations to establish simple agricultural warehouses to operate warehousing and lending businesses. Now, agricultural warehouses have been established in various provinces and are closely linked to each other for mutual regulation.</p>
<p>Make Every Effort to Restrict the Import of Foreign Rice</p>
<p>In order to adjust foreign trade and reduce trade deficits, the government has made every effort to restrict the import of foreign rice. If provinces want to purchase foreign rice and wheat, they must obtain prior approval from the Executive Yuan. As a result, the import volume of foreign rice and wheat has sharply decreased since June of last year. However, the import of miscellaneous grains still ranked first among imported foreign goods throughout the year, valued at customs gold 56,934,215, equivalent to 130,004,931 yuan in national currency. Among them, foreign rice was 56.39 million yuan and wheat flour was 52.98 million yuan.</p>
<p>Food Management Measures in War Zones</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has promulgated the "Outline of Management Measures for Food in War Zones," which will be handled by the competent authorities. Adequate military and civilian food reserves are stored in important national defense areas near the war zone. In addition to the military food quantity being stipulated and handled by the Military Affairs Commission, the civilian food should be determined by the local governments according to the population ratio and the quantity of food required for several months, and they are responsible for storing the reserves and strictly prohibit unscrupulous merchants from speculating and manipulating the market. The highest and lowest prices of food should be carefully stipulated in light of the actual situation.</p>
<p>Exempt Re-export Taxes and Circulate Domestically</p>
<p>After the surplus of food in one place should be supplied to the insufficient places as much as possible, the Ministry of Finance exempted the re-export tax on miscellaneous grains and products, such as rice bran, buckwheat, wheat flour, sorghum, corn, millet, rice noodles, bean cake, and wheat, so as to ensure the circulation of food in the country. However, the export and re-export of food to the occupied areas is absolutely prohibited. At the same time, the customs strictly guard against private exports. Therefore, last year's exports of miscellaneous grains and their products were only valued at 4,850,955 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>Strictly Prevent Private Export of Food</p>
<p>Japanese merchants and North China merchants colluded with food merchants to purchase food from the guerrilla areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and transport it to Shanghai, then transship it to Japanese ships to transport it north. It is estimated that it has exceeded one million shi, resulting in a gradual thinning of reserves in the guerrilla areas, affecting the civilian food in the war zone. Our government has ordered the governments of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to strictly prevent unscrupulous merchants from privately exporting food. Now, the guerrillas in the guerrilla areas have been ordered to severely punish and never pardon those who assist Japan in privately exporting food. Any legitimate merchants who want to purchase food from the guerrilla areas must have supporting documents.</p>
<h3>Intensify the Elimination of British and American Rights and Interests; Japan Sends Tsuda to Shanghai; Organize the "East Asia Institute Central China Liaison Branch" to Control Central China's Economic and Cultural Exclusion and Annihilate China</h3>
<p>According to informed sources, Japan is planning to actively eliminate the rights and interests of Britain, the United States, and France in China and is plotting to control the economic and cultural undertakings in Central China. The implementation will now be intensified. Tokyo has recently sent Major General Tsuda to Shanghai to organize the so-called "East Asia Institute Central China Liaison Branch," an organization to destroy China and exclude foreigners.</p>
<h3>The Tiger Car Modified Wheel Case is Resolved Amicably; Two Chinese Directors Negotiated with the Authorities; The Impounded Cars are Expected to be Released Today</h3>
<p>The case of the Tiger cars of the Shanghai market Tiger Car Mutual Aid Association being impounded by various police stations for being unable to modify their wheels has been mediated by the two Chinese directors Jiang and Xi. Philippe has instructed the two police and vehicle affairs directors, together with Deputy General Manager He and the two Chinese directors Jiang and Xi, to discuss and agree on an amicable solution. The deadline for modifying the vehicles will be extended to July 1st of this year, and the association will be responsible for persuading the members to complete the modifications. Regarding the release of the impounded cars, as yesterday was Sunday, it is expected to be released today.</p>
<h3>The British Ambassador's Wife Donates Generously; She Donates a Huge Sum of Money to Help Our Distressed Compatriots</h3>
<p>Lady Kerr, the wife of the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Kerr Clark Kerr, expressed great sympathy for our distressed compatriots and has repeatedly donated funds to cover relief expenses. Recently, she donated another 500 yuan in legal tender and sent it to the Shanghai Charity Organization Joint Committee to assist the Chinese Laborers' Shelter. The committee has replied with a letter of thanks.</p>
<h3>The Industry Group of the Refugee Relief Association Issues a Declaration; The Committee is Elected to Jointly Promote Progress</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the industry associations in this city discussed the organization of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Industry Group Fundraising Committee at the New Licha Tea House. A committee was elected to actively promote progress, and it was decided not to collect donations on behalf of others, but only to be responsible for supervising and promoting fundraising. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Elected Committee: Xu Jiying, Yu Zuoting, Jin Runxiang, Zhu Wenqi, Ma Shaoquan, Zheng Zenan, Sun Qiuping, Zhang Lianfang, Wang Yuanzhang, Chen Wenming, Li Wenjie, Chen Ziyi, Lu Wenshao, Gan Tinghui, Chen Panjun, Liu Minzhai, Yang Weiyin, Ding Fangyuan, Tu Kaizheng, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Zhou Bangjun, Shen Weiting, Zhang Wenkui, Yu Langxi, Xu Wenzhao, Ge Weian, Feng Qingan, Hong Wenjiang, Cheng Kefan, Wu Xingcha, and others were elected as committee members and have been reported to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association for record.</p>
<p>The Declaration: The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's articles of association stipulate that the fundraising of refugee funds should be carried out in five groups as specified in Article 2: 1. Industry Group, 2. Citizen Group, 3. Freelance Professional Group, 4. Wealthy Group, 5. Hometown Group. Now, the Citizen Group and the Hometown Group have successively established fundraising committees and worked hard to promote progress, achieving excellent results. Shanghai is known for its prosperous commerce, but the Industry Group Fundraising Committee has been slow to organize, leading to criticism for falling behind. Although since the establishment of the Refugee Relief Association, the various industries have been very active in drawing salaries, deducting commissions from business, paying monthly donations, and making one-time donations, they have been acting independently and lacking the promotion of a unified organization. In order to fulfill the responsibility of Shanghai people to relieve Shanghai refugees, the various industries have mutually supervised and promoted the establishment of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Industry Group Fundraising Committee, so that those who have already donated can seek to be universal and lasting, and those who have not yet organized can jointly supervise and promote their progress, and promote overall expansion, so as to assist in relieving Shanghai refugees. We hope that all merchants in the city will understand this and wish for it.</p>
<h3>Various Charity Organizations Give a Farewell Party for Penna; Mr. and Mrs. Penna Are Enthusiastic in Relief Work; Silver Shields and Gifts Are Presented at the Banquet</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, nine charity organizations in this city, including the Chinese Red Cross, held a banquet at the International Hotel yesterday (4th) afternoon to bid farewell to Mr. and Mrs. Penna, well-known relief workers in this city. Dr. Yen Hui-ching hosted the banquet, and silver shields and rice bowls were presented to Mr. Penna to thank him for his hard work in relief work in China. Mr. Penna said in his speech, "I not only hope that Chinese and foreigners will continue to cooperate, but also hope to improve all relationships, and finally be able to promote international friendship, understanding, and mutual assistance." Mr. Penna has worked at Citibank for more than 30 years and is also the treasurer of the American Advisory Committee for Relief of Civilians in China. He will return to the United States with his wife within the month and will reside in the suburbs of Boston.</p>
<h3>Redemption of Principal and Interest on Reconstruction Bonds at the End of the Month; The Ministry of Finance Maintains Debt Credit and Raises Additional Funds for Payment</h3>
<p>In order to maintain the credit of domestic debt, the Ministry of Finance will change the payment of principal and interest on public bonds to Chongqing. For the principal and interest on unified bonds and other public bonds that are due, the Chung Kuo, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China will still make payments as usual. Although the customs duties guaranteed by these public bonds are uncollected due to the seizure of customs tax revenue, the government will still find ways to raise funds for payment. The National Debt Fund Management Committee and the Central Bank have both been ordered by the Ministry to pay on schedule, and all methods are the same as those for unification bonds. As for the seventh redemption of the principal of the unification bonds, the Class A bonds are scheduled to be drawn at 10:00 a.m. on the 10th of this month in Shanghai, and the three banks will pay in full on July 31st. The National Debt Fund Management Committee has notified the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the silver and money industry associations, and the First Special District Court to send personnel to the site to monitor the event.</p>
<h3>Export Restrictions by Yantai Customs Postponed for Half a Month; Allowing Chinese and Foreign Merchants to Fulfill Existing Contracts; The Short Deadline Made it Difficult to Complete Orders</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily, in order to enable Chinese and foreign merchants to fulfill their sales contracts concluded before January 15, the "Provisional Government" of Peiping, through the Yantai Customs authorities, postponed some of the export restrictions imposed last Wednesday until February 15, so that these merchants could complete their outstanding contracts. Among the main commodities for which Yantai foreign trade has temporarily delayed export restrictions, peanuts are also among them. Yantai has been an important export site for peanuts for many years. It is said that many foreign merchants still have a large number of orders that have not been fulfilled when the new export regulations are announced. The reporter asked merchants in this city last night if they believe that the remaining peanut orders can be fulfilled before February 15, but they were vague. Embroidery and lace, straw hats and hairnets are all major export goods from Yantai. In view of the fact that there are still a large number of orders for these goods, the "Provisional Government" of Peiping, through the Yantai Customs authorities, has postponed the export restrictions on these commodities for half a month.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle at Customs Port; Japanese Army Suffers Defeat; Xu's Troops Arrive Near Minhang; Rumors of Guerrilla Warfare in Bailianjing</h3>
<p>Hua's troops, Xu's Regiment, have already arrived near Minhang and had a fierce battle with the Japanese army at the Customs Port a few days ago. Recently, under the order of Commander Li, they took over the defense of Pudong Zhagang, Chegougang, Lujiahui, and other places. A few days ago, the Japanese army launched a three-pronged attack on Xu's Regiment. Xu's Regiment calmly fought back, killing and wounding more than 70 Japanese "puppets," and finally drove out the Japanese marines entrenched there and retreated to warships. Now, all ports in Punan have been strictly defended. Japanese warships have moved to Pudong, and Japanese merchant ships cannot pass through and dock. The Chinese regular army has approached the suburbs of the city, less than fifteen kilometers away. The Japanese side has closed most of the ports in Pudong, except for Wangjiadu, Dujiahang, and Zhagang, and has declared them closed, making it extremely difficult for residents to travel. It is also rumored that guerrilla warfare occurred in Bailianjing yesterday. Currently, the ferry from the concession to the Bailianjing Liuliqiao has been suspended.</p>
<h3>Unified Export of Tung Oil; Handled by China Vegetable Oil Company</h3>
<p>Tung oil is one of our country's main native products and occupies an important position in international trade. Since the Anti-Japanese War, because the tung oil production area is still within the scope of the national army's protection, exports have not been affected. Recently, after the government's sharp rectification, personnel have been sent to guide planting in various provinces such as Sichuan, Yunnan, Hunan, and Hubei, and the output will increase even more. According to tung tree planters, if the tung oil production area does not change due to war, the annual output can reach more than 70,000 tons in the future. However, the government has successively implemented controls on various major native products. Now, the national export of tung oil has been stipulated to be uniformly bought and sold by the Trade Commission in order to avoid fragmentation. It is heard that the Trade Commission has entrusted this work to the China Vegetable Oil Company.</p>

<h3>Chinese Mobile Unit Seizes Important Weapons at Qiujiang Wharf; Deeply Penetrated at Midnight to Seize Machine Guns and Anti-Aircraft Guns; Several Japanese Soldiers Guarding Were Killed and Withdrew</h3>
<p>The Qiujiang Wharf in the downtown area of Shanghai is the zone where the Japanese transport armaments and military supplies are collected. It has been decided that a large number of machine guns and the latest anti-aircraft guns have been transported to Shanghai and stored in the Japanese storage factory near Wusong. However, now the Chinese mobile unit is very active in the Wusong Dachang area. A few days ago, the Chinese mobile unit deeply penetrated at midnight and seized eleven machine guns and a latest anti-aircraft gun and ammunition stored by the Japanese. (This latest product of anti-aircraft gun is very precious) and killed several Japanese soldiers guarding it. After reporting to the superior, they received a lot of awards. However, after the Japanese suffered this setback and lost a large amount of armaments, they have become stricter in their evening preparations and are conducting major searches in various villages.</p>
<h3>Shanghai and Ningbo Business Circles Urge Dredging Transportation; Telegraphing to Both Ministries to Order Customs Clearance to Aid Inland Finance</h3>
<p>After the Zhejiang Customs was ordered to prohibit the export of Zhejiang Eastern local products to Shanghai, industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai and Ningbo telegraphed to the Ministries of Finance and Economy, requesting them to order the release of goods to maintain commercial stability and alleviate people's difficulties. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Request to Release Ningbo Cotton: The Ningbo Shaoxing Cotton Transportation and Sales Office stated that the stored cotton is valued at 10 million yuan. The expiration of the current settlement period, coupled with the ban on transportation, affects the livelihoods of millions of cotton farmers and merchants, as well as resources for the war effort. Moreover, the Ningbo cotton shipped to Shanghai has been verified by the Ministry of Finance's Trade Commission as being destined for Shanghai's public concession, where numerous Chinese-owned yarn factories are located, and which is not under violent control and cannot be designated as a prohibited area. They have detailed the reasons and requested the Ningbo Chamber of Commerce to forward them to the provincial government and the Provincial Property Adjustment Office, and to telegraph the Ministry of Finance to promptly order the Zhejiang Customs to release the goods to aid inland finance. The Chamber of Commerce responded by sending a letter to the Ministry of Finance, requesting that the Zhejiang Customs be ordered to release the goods as before.</p>
<p>Tea Merchant Representatives Appeal: The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce also received a petition from more than ten tea merchant representatives, including Shi Henglan, Ye Zhengxing, and Huang Shouji (details omitted above). They stated that part of the raw tea transported by merchants, which has been滞留 in Ningbo, amounts to more than 1,200 pieces. All customs duties, inspections, and other procedures have been completed, and they are awaiting shipment to Shanghai for sale to close their accounts. Recently, they were ordered to prohibit the export of 55 types of local products considered war material, and tea is also on the list of prohibited items. The merchants are extremely anxious. They have read in the newspaper that the director-general, sympathizing with the merchants' difficulties and caring for the country and its people, has taken it upon himself to alleviate their hardships by telegraphing the Ministries of Finance and Economy for approval to order the Zhejiang Customs to allow normal loading and export to aid the situation. The merchants should not have made further requests, but they are all small businesses, and their lives and property are at stake. Moreover, the tea has been transported to Ningbo for as long as four or five months, initially due to incomplete customs declaration procedures, and then due to the suspension of shipping between Ningbo and Shanghai. The expenses for travel, tea transportation, customs duties, and inspections have already caused immeasurable losses. Now, with the sudden ban on export, the small profit they hoped for is lost, and an unexpected major loss is imminent. With the Lunar New Year approaching, and no prospect of export, they cannot return as they wish, nor can they remedy the situation. They are compelled to submit this joint petition, pleading with the director-general to consider their sincerity, sympathize with their difficulties, and continue to telegraph for assistance to maintain commerce and alleviate the people's hardship. They also request a written reply to fulfill the merchants' expectations, and they await orders with the utmost urgency.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Customs to Employ a Large Number of Japanese Personnel, According to Reports from Tokyo</h3>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 5th: The House of Representatives announced today that after the reorganization of the Shanghai Customs, 70 Japanese will enter the Jianghai Customs as staff members.</p>
<h3>Except for Insured Letters, Money is Prohibited in Letters; Confiscation Upon Discovery</h3>
<p>With the end of the year fast approaching, people from various places residing in Shanghai are remitting funds, causing a surge in business for the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau. However, due to a lack of understanding of remittance procedures, many people repeatedly fail to enclose remittance receipts in their letters, or even include money in their letters, causing difficulties for the post office. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the person in charge of the Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau yesterday that, according to Article 17 of the Postal Regulations, cash and banknotes are prohibited from being sent to various places in the country, except in insured letters. According to the same article, if cash or banknotes are found in non-insured letters, they will be confiscated. Recently, due to the approaching end of the year, remittance business has been quite busy. However, some senders are trying to save money by including banknotes in their letters, unaware that this practice easily endangers the post office's mail. Messengers sent by private households to deliver letters are often tempted, leading to shifting blame onto the post office. In the future, all remitters are urged that, for letters sent domestically, if they have not purchased insured envelopes and delivered them, and if they privately include money, once discovered, the banknotes will be confiscated by the post office in full. The remittance receipt with stamps must be attached to the registered letter, so that the post office can deliver it and make payment accordingly.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Penetrate Baoshan City, Tie Up Puppets and Leave; Zhao Asan Commits All Kinds of Evil, Public Resentment Boils Over; Father and Three Sons Arrested, Hearers Rejoice</h3>
<p>Zhao Asan, a Baoshan native, is over forty years old and lives next to the puppet police station at the West City Gate. He is a plasterer by trade and has always been dishonest, committing all kinds of evil. After Baoshan was occupied by the Japanese army, Zhao used his eloquent tongue to gain the trust of a certain Japanese officer, accompanying him in and out and acting as a puppet for the comfort corps maintenance association, freely claiming to be the chairman of the maintenance association. Zhao Asan took this opportunity to open a contracting factory, first demolishing the</p>
<p>Drum Tower in the center of the city. Countless civilian houses were demolished. Anyone who wanted to build a house had to contact him first. After agreeing on a price, he would demolish someone else's house to build it. The ill-gotten gains from this alone were quite substantial. The people dared to be angry but dared not speak out. At twelve o'clock late last night, more than a hundred guerrillas from a certain unit in the west, carrying thirty Mauser pistols, light machine guns, rifles, and ammunition, suddenly arrived at the West Gate drawbridge. First, three or four people went up the bridge and set up a</p>
<p>Wire mesh frame. Just as they were about to move it, two police officers at the police station discovered them and shouted, "Who are you?" The guerrillas replied that they were detectives. The puppet police, unaware, mistook them for their own kind and helped to remove the frame. The guerrillas swarmed in, each raising a Mauser pistol, first tying up the two policemen and putting them in the station. They also tied up the patrol chief and eight puppet policemen who were already asleep. The remaining team members rushed into the Zhao family next door, arresting Zhao Asan and his eldest son, tying them up securely. The team members, having completed their mission, marched off with Zhao Asan and his son, who called themselves chairmen.</p>
<p>Heading west. At that time, the bound puppet police officers managed to break free and reported to the puppet police bureau on County Front Street. The puppet bureau chief immediately assembled a team and summoned puppet police from the four city gate police stations, as well as Japanese and puppet soldiers, to pursue them in large numbers. Little did they know that the guerrillas had already disappeared like the Yellow Crane. The Japanese puppet soldiers and police chased in vain for a while, and returned without a trace. Therefore, from yesterday onwards, the city area was under special curfew. Major roads such as the West Gate outside the West Market, Slightly Larger Street entrance, and Zhangjia Lane City Gate entrance were guarded by large groups of Japanese puppet soldiers and police, who were strictly checking people and villagers. According to Baoshan residents, Baoshan has a total of eleven major traitors, and Zhao is one of them. His arrest this time has gladdened the hearts of the people.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on Jewish Refugees Coming to Shanghai; Consular Body Has No Solution; Only Telegraphing to Their Countries to Try to Persuade Jews Not to Come; Local Relief Organizations About to Run Out of Funds</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that in late December of last year, the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Consular Body regarding the issue of restricting the entry of European refugees, expressing its opinions. Yesterday (the 4th), it was learned from highly reliable sources that the Consular Body has drafted a reply to this suggestion, which will be submitted to the Municipal Council in the coming days. This reply does not propose</p>
<p>Remedies for the issue of refugee entry, and regarding the bureau's request, other than allowing members of the Consular Body to report the current situation in Shanghai to their governments and request them to try to persuade Jews and other refugees not to come to Shanghai, the remaining points have not been agreed to. It is said that the bureau is willing to do everything it can to assist refugees who have already arrived here, but it feels that if serious consequences are to be avoided in the future, Shanghai cannot accommodate any more refugees. Therefore, it has sent</p>
<p>A letter to the Consular Body to discuss measures to restrict or even prevent European refugees from continuing to come to Shanghai. The Consular Body has held several meetings to discuss this issue and has decided to formally submit its reply to the Municipal Council in the coming days. It is said that the Consular Body has considered all relevant factors and has decided that each member of the Consular Body should immediately report this matter to their</p>
<p>Home government, stating that Shanghai's labor and employment problems are quite serious, and requesting the government to use posters and leaflets in travel and shipping agencies to advise immigrants not to use Shanghai as their refuge. However, the Consular Body feels that it can do nothing else, as this is not an easy problem to solve. Germany, Italy, France, and other countries are certainly happy for the refugees to leave, and cannot</p>
<p>Exert pressure on shipping companies not to carry refugees. Chinese consulates in Europe issue passports to those applying to go to Shanghai in accordance with the treaties signed between China and various countries when Shanghai was opened as a trading port. It is said that neither the Consular Body nor the Municipal Council has telegraphed the Chinese government to request instructions for its consulates abroad to stop issuing passports. If the Consular Body and the bureau decide to request the Chinese government to issue this telegram, this measure can also be taken. The reason why this request has not been made</p>
<p>Is obvious: due to the war, Shanghai currently has no passport office, and foreigners coming to Shanghai do not need to go through the procedure of having their passports approved. The situation of Jewish refugees in Shanghai is currently serious. It is expected that by the end of March, their number will exceed 4,000, a large proportion of whom are indeed destitute. More refugees are expected to arrive in about two weeks, but the funds of local Jewish relief organizations will be exhausted. It is said that there is absolutely no certainty of raising the necessary funds at present.</p>
<h3>If a Man Suffers from Kidney Disease, No Matter How Youthful the Companion, Marital Discord is Inevitable</h3>
<p>According to Dr. Meng Sili, a German medical doctor, the kidneys are the major source of reproduction and the origin of sperm. They are also the foundation of the body's vital functions. According to physiological analysis, the (Spermini) secretions of the Youth Glands in the kidneys, including adrenal medulla and adrenaline, are the key elements for the development of various parts of the body. They ascend and descend, circulating through the blood vessels to all parts of the body, aiding in their development. Moreover, Spermini is the primary driving force for reproductive functions. Therefore, a person's happiness and the propagation of offspring are based on this. If this fluid is slightly deficient, not only will couples lose their happiness, but the nutrition of all parts of the body will be insufficient. Kidney deficiency, blood depletion, and other diseases will arise from this. The symptoms of kidney deficiency and blood depletion initially manifest as insufficient energy and loss of appetite, making it difficult to perform strenuous work. This is followed by impotence and premature ejaculation, greatly diminishing the joy of life. No matter how youthful the companion, marital discord is inevitable. Even if they have been married for many years, they cannot live in harmony. Before reaching middle age, youth is lost early. Before reaching the age of knowing one's destiny, old age is already evident. Therefore, on cloudy days before rain, one feels lower back pain and bone pain. While reading or working, one often suffers from dizziness and vertigo. There are countless symptoms. If one does not take early care or continues to harm oneself, the lamp will run out of oil, and the consequences will be endless. The inability to have children is especially painful. The way to remedy this is to take the scientifically prepared "German Tiger Pills," which tonify the kidneys, blood, essence, and brain. The main ingredient in this pill is the testicular essence of powerful animals, which can increase the vitality of endocrine functions. It is supplemented with phosphorus to nourish the brain, iron to nourish the blood, calcium to strengthen the bones, and other precious medicinal materials. Therefore, its tonic power is far beyond that of ordinary tonics. Even compared to the tonic power of ginseng and deer velvet, it cannot be surpassed. Moreover, the medicinal power is balanced and comprehensive, benefiting the whole body. Those who are old and suffering from kidney deficiency and blood depletion, exhausted in energy, middle-aged and burdened with work, with emaciated muscles, insufficient brainpower, or young men who have depleted themselves through excessive sexual activity, suffering from nocturnal emission, impotence, premature ejaculation, back pain, and lower back pain, can eliminate all these ailments by taking "German Tiger Pills" for a few days. They will strengthen the kidney function, replenish essence and spirit, invigorate qi and blood, have rosy cheeks and smooth skin, strengthen muscles and bones, increase body weight, transform the sick into the strong, and enjoy family happiness. What could be better? The price of "German Tiger Pills" is two yuan for a large bottle and one yuan for a small bottle.</p>

<h3>Mountain Paths Blocked by Snow, Foreigners Unable to Leave Kuling; More Than Ten Suffering from Illness, Especially Unable to Endure the Hardship; Kuling Founder Liddell Dies</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reported that yesterday (the 4th), according to the wife of a major American expatriate in Kuling, if the Japanese authorities forced the foreigners in Kuling to evacuate, the fate of the sixteen to eighteen sick foreigners trapped in the mountains would be death. The wife listed the names of those who could not endure the hardship of descending the mountain and said that even in peaceful times, with mild weather, few of these sick foreigners could safely descend the mountain. Now, in the middle of winter, with the added war, the thought of evacuation is difficult to realize. The steep mountain paths are blocked by snow and frozen, making them treacherous to walk on. Even the sturdy Chinese coolies dare not venture there. Therefore, the sick cannot be carried down the mountain at present, and healthy men will not abandon the sick to seek safety alone. This is what she dares to say. The wife concluded that forcing the foreigners in Kuling to evacuate at this time would be better than bombing them to death. Liddell, the founder of Kuling, passed away last Thursday at his residence in New Silk Lane, and a Japanese spokesman announced on the same day that he had ordered the foreigners to evacuate. Liddell used to serve in the American Methodist Church in Jiujiang, and in 1895 he first negotiated the purchase of property by foreigners in Kuling. He was seventy-five years old this year.</p>
<h3>French Concession to Award Medals to Father Gherzi</h3>

<h3>Japanese Attempt to Expand Shanghai-Songjiang Railway, Forcibly Repairing Yunzaobang Bridge; Vehicle Traffic Very Dangerous</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the war, the surface of the Shanghai-Songjiang Railway has been damaged, especially the section from Zhanghuabang to Paotaiwan in the north, where the rails have been destroyed and the roadbed has collapsed, as if on flat ground. The Yunzaobang Railway Bridge was previously filled in with wooden planks by the Japanese army, and cars traveled back and forth, causing the bridge to rot. Since the Japanese merchants repaired and opened the Shanghai Railway from Zhanghuabang to the south, it has only reached the grain and rice stack wharf. Recently, it was heard that the Japanese are planning to extend the line to Baoshan. One rumor says it needs to be built to Liuhang, which is certain, but it is difficult to predict now. However, the Yunzaobang Railway Bridge has been hiring 40 to 50 craftsmen since last month to repair it. Currently, cars enter and exit, and they now pass through the Yunzaobang Bridge on the west side. However, the bridge has been burned twice in the "January 28th" and "August 13th" incidents, and the bridge deck has been narrowed repeatedly. Now, it is only a foot or so wide, and only one car can pass through at a time, which is very dangerous. On the open space on the north bank of the bridge, there are piles of old boilers of various sizes, as well as scrap iron such as damaged car leaf spring axles, etc., collected from various places (estimated to be about 1,000 piculs). They must wait for the ship to arrive before they can be transported to Japan for use.</p>

<h3>Woman Deceives Young Girl to Help Others Commit Adultery</h3>

<p>Zhu Fuxiang's daughter, Zhu Xiuying, who lived near Dapuqiao, French Concession, is from Jiangbei,</p>
<p>Age 17 this year, formerly a factory worker, on the 17th of last month,</p>
<p>Afternoon, by a familiar female compatriot Zhang Tian (</p>

<h3>Shanghai Residents, Please Note: The Importance of Year-End Preparations - Not Just Old Wives' Tales - Worth a Read for Homeowners</h3>
<p>Be Careful of Fire: As we approach the end of the lunar year, the countryside retains</p>
<p>its ancient customs. One often hears the watchman's cry of "</p>
<p>Be careful of fire!" in Shanghai's</p>
<p>neighborhood streets. However, Shanghai's material progress</p>
<p>far surpasses that of the countryside. In the cold weather, with electric heaters and water radiators,</p>
<p>the warning "Be careful of fire!" seems outdated. However, homeowner</p>
<p>couples work hard all year, inevitably depleting their physical strength. If</p>
<p>they don't nourish themselves in time, not only will various old ailments</p>
<p>likely recur in the spring, but even those without pre-existing conditions may experience</p>
<p>a decline in energy, with each year worse than the last. During this time,</p>
<p>children to parents, wives to husbands, younger siblings to older siblings, should use</p>
<p>the cautionary words of "Be careful of fire!" to pay attention to their health,</p>
<p>and purchase appropriate tonics. For example, "Weiling Malt Extract Cod</p>
<p>Liver Oil" nourishes the brain, treats the lungs, strengthens the stomach, and builds the body,</p>
<p>produces essence and replenishes blood, and is fragrant and delicious. "Weiling Pure Cod Liver Oil" is pure</p>
<p>and not fishy, and its efficacy is significant. These two are most suitable. The Zhengwei Pharmacy,</p>
<p>opposite the Grand Theater on Second Avenue, sells them. The price of</p>
<p>Malt Extract Cod Liver Oil is $1.80 per three-pound bottle, and Pure Cod</p>
<p>Liver Oil is $2.40 per large bottle. To commemorate the 10th anniversary of its launch,</p>
<p>10,000 bottles are given away. Buy one get one free, a truly rare</p>
<p>opportunity. Furthermore, in terms of winter protection, one should also be aware of</p>
<p>the Descent of Petty Thieves: Considering the body, if the weather is</p>
<p>unpredictable, it is easy to catch a cold and cough.</p>
<p>This is no different from burglars entering a home, employing</p>
<p>their means of robbery. Therefore, the common term is "wind evil." This ailment may seem minor,</p>
<p>but its impact is significant. Conditions such as pneumonia, asthma, tuberculosis,</p>
<p>and hemoptysis are often triggered by colds and coughs, which is no less</p>
<p>dangerous than a burglar injuring the homeowner. The "Weiling Compound White Pine Syrup,"</p>
<p>sold by Zhengwei Pharmacy, is the most suitable lung medicine for the Chinese body,</p>
<p>far superior to other similar preparations. Each bottle is priced at one dollar, with a special price of 75 cents. Those who are ill</p>
<p>should buy it quickly. Even those who are not ill should buy a bottle to have on hand, as treating</p>
<p>colds and coughs as early as possible is best. This "Weiling Compound White Pine Syrup"</p>
<p>is the sentinel of respiratory diseases.</p>
<p>However, daily nutrition is primarily based on food. If the</p>
<p>appetite is poor, food intake is low, or absorption is weak, making assimilation difficult,</p>
<p>it is as if</p>
<p>the Doors are Wide Open: Easily inviting thieves into the house, leading to</p>
<p>a multitude of diseases. Therefore, if stomach ailments are not treated,</p>
<p>nutrition is insufficient, and the body is weak.</p>
<p>Even if delicacies are available every day, it will be in vain. Taking too many tonics is</p>
<p>beyond reach and difficult to fully succeed. However, stomach ailments are often not</p>
<p>easily cured. Those who have been sick for a long time, eat little and have many troubles, find it extremely</p>
<p>difficult. Zhengwei Pharmacy manufactures and sells "170 Stomach Pain Medicine," which has been tested repeatedly and shown to be effective immediately and cure the root cause. It can be said to be the new era of stomach medicine.</p>
<p>Whether new or old stomach ailments, stomach pain, bloating, vomiting, constipation, aversion to food,</p>
<p>belching, or acid reflux, it has the miraculous effect of eliminating the disease. Once the stomach ailment is gone, even</p>
<p>coarse tea and plain rice can exert their nutritional power. Preventing</p>
<p>disease is paramount to this. "170 Stomach Pain Medicine" is specially priced at 85 cents per bottle. In addition, in cold weather, there is also a minor ailment, just like</p>
<p>a Kitchen Burglary: Cups, dishes, spoons, and chopsticks disappear without a trace.</p>
<p>The number is very small, but the temporary</p>
<p>inconvenience is significant. For example, the parts of our body</p>
<p>exposed to the outside are often attacked by the cold, resulting in</p>
<p>frostbite, causing unbearable pain and itching. After ulceration, pus and blood</p>
<p>drip, which is quite unpleasant. Zhengwei Pharmacy has "Frostbite Ruyi</p>
<p>Water" specially for treating un-ulcerated frostbite. Once applied, the pain and itching stop immediately.</p>
<p>Apply it quickly every day, and the swelling and redness will subside. For those that have ulcerated, there is also</p>
<p>"Pearl White Jade Ointment" to apply to the wound once or twice a day,</p>
<p>and new flesh will grow quickly, healing it within days. Why should patients endure</p>
<p>years of delay, causing all sorts of inconvenience? Ruyi Water</p>
<p>is priced at 25 cents per bottle, and White Jade Ointment is priced at 40</p>
<p>cents per box. Zhengwei Pharmacy is located at the intersection of Yinghua Street on Second Avenue (</p>
<p>Telephone 92525, free delivery for purchases). Old customers</p>
<p>call it the winter defense headquarters for the human body. It can be said that the name is not exaggerated.</p>
<p>Readers, please do not consider this mere empty words.</p>
<h3>Robbers Sentenced: One to Five Years Imprisonment, Two to Six Months Imprisonment, Printing Shop Owner Fined</h3>
<p>Robber Wang Xinghui from Ningbo, residing</p>
<p>at his friend Ah Er's place at 55 North Jiangxi</p>
<p>Road, colluded with Ah Tang and Ah Fa, who were still at large,</p>
<p>at 8 PM on the 22nd of last month, carrying weapons</p>
<p>entered Zhang Xinghua Coal Shop at 7 Tiantong Road.</p>
<p>Wang, the robber, held a bamboo basket, claiming to buy coal briquettes as</p>
<p>an excuse, seized the opportunity to pull out a fake pistol and threatened the shop staff</p>
<p>to remain silent, robbing them of valuables worth two hundred</p>
<p>and thirty yuan, and fleeing in different directions.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Huishi Police Station's Chinese Detective Shang Wu and Detective</p>
<p>Shen Dehui apprehended Wang, along with the fake</p>
<p>pistol, and brought them to the police station, handing them over to</p>
<p>the First Special District Court for investigation and detention. Yesterday,</p>
<p>Judge Jiang Shuzi continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court.</p>
<p>The police station's lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated that the two robbers,</p>
<p>Ah Fa and Ah Tang, who were at large, could not be apprehended.</p>
<p>Questioned the defendant, who admitted to receiving</p>
<p>20 yuan of the stolen money after the fact. Judge Jiang sentenced</p>
<p>Wang Xinghui to five years imprisonment, and the fake pistol was</p>
<p>confiscated.</p>
<p>Gu Panhou and Gu Jifu, from Tongzhou,</p>
<p>on December 24th of last year, at 10:30</p>
<p>PM, sneaked into an empty house at 926 Tangshan Road,</p>
<p>climbed into it, and stole sixteen printing lithographs worth one hundred</p>
<p>and eighty yuan, selling</p>
<p>them to Fuxing Printing Company at 34 Dalian Bay Road on Aikao Ke Road,</p>
<p>and dividing the spoils.</p>
<p>The case was uncovered by Huishan Police Station's Chinese Detective Ji Peijin,</p>
<p>who apprehended the two Gu's and implicated the printing company's</p>
<p>owner, Hu Yaokui from Wuxi, and his partner Zhang Debao,</p>
<p>for jointly instigating theft. Detective Ji's father went</p>
<p>and apprehended the two, handing them over to the First Special District</p>
<p>Court for investigation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng</p>
<p>continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Hu Yaokui and Zhang Debao</p>
<p>pleaded not guilty to instigating and hired Fan Gang and Yu Enliang</p>
<p>as lawyers to defend them. Judge Huang sentenced Gu Panhou and Gu Jifu</p>
<p>to six months imprisonment each, Hu Yaokui to a fine of one hundred and forty yuan,</p>
<p>and Zhang Debao was found not guilty.</p>
<h3>French Police Station - Rigorous Apprehension of Robbers</h3>
<p>The previous day, at the intersection of Caishi Road and Kangti Road in the French Concession,</p>
<p>a Chinese and Western policeman had a scuffle with robbers, resulting</p>
<p>in one robber being killed and another robber, Fan Xiaomao, being apprehended.</p>
<p>Details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that</p>
<p>yesterday, the Westerner from the French General Police Station's Photography Department</p>
<p>went to the Tongren Fuwu Branch Hall to examine the body, taking</p>
<p>several detailed photographs of the bullet entry and exit wounds of the slain robber's body,</p>
<p>and taking fingerprints for future reference. However, the deceased,</p>
<p>as of yesterday evening, had no family members coming</p>
<p>to visit or claim the body. It is reported that the French Police Station is</p>
<p>interrogating the apprehended robber Fan Xiaomao,</p>
<p>investigating the three accomplices who are at large, striving to bring them to justice</p>
<p>and punish them to the fullest extent of the law. Furthermore, regarding the search for</p>
<p>criminals within the concession, due to the approaching end of the lunar year, the</p>
<p>police have increased the number of detectives on patrol on all roads, day and night,</p>
<p>to inspect. If they encounter suspicious pedestrians, they will be subjected to rigorous</p>
<p>interrogation. If robbers resist, they are allowed to kill them</p>
<p>without question.</p>
<h3>An Unjustly Lost Soul Under a Vehicle</h3>
<p>An Eight-Year-Old Child</p>
<p>At the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue</p>
<p>Chongqing, at one o'clock yesterday afternoon,</p>
<p>a child named Xu Guitang,</p>
<p>eight years old, was walking in the middle of the road when suddenly</p>
<p>he was hit by a public bus driving by.</p>
<p>His skull was crushed, and he was bleeding profusely, on the verge of</p>
<p>death. Bao Kong, officer 239 of Chengdu Road Police Station,</p>
<p>saw the accident and recorded the bus number.</p>
<p>He quickly took the injured to Renji Hospital, but</p>
<p>his injuries were too severe. He died on the way</p>
<p>before reaching the hospital.</p>
<p>A Middle-Aged Coolie - At the intersection of Beijing Road and Henan Road,</p>
<p>at around 6:30 last night,</p>
<p>a man, about</p>
<p>thirty years old, wearing</p>
<p>blue shirt and trousers, carrying a bamboo shoulder pole,</p>
<p>was passing through there when a public bus</p>
<p>drove by. He was unable to avoid it in time and was knocked</p>
<p>to the ground, injuring his waist. His breath was faint. Later,</p>
<p>Street Officer 157 of the Fourth Avenue Central Police Station</p>
<p>arrived upon hearing the news and summoned an ambulance, which</p>
<p>took him to Renji Hospital for treatment. However, his injuries were too severe,</p>
<p>and medical treatment was ineffective. He died fifteen minutes later. However,</p>
<p>the bamboo shoulder pole had the name "Gong Shuntai Limestone Factory,</p>
<p>133 North Fujian Road" written on it.</p>
<p>Based on this, it is speculated that the deceased was likely the factory's</p>
<p>old foreman.</p>
<h3>The Entire Village of Xujiahui Civilian Village Reduced to Ashes: Approximately 445 Houses and 8-900 Households - Over a Thousand Refugees Face the Threat of Cold and Hunger</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Civilian First Village, located west of Xujiahui Town, near Xuzhen Road, experienced a sudden</p>
<p>fire in the middle of the night the night before, destroying hundreds of reed mat sheds and affecting eight or nine hundred households, as reported in yesterday's newspaper.</p>
<p>Our reporter went to the scene of the fire to investigate. The affected area is located east of Tongwen Academy on Hongqiao Road (i.e.,</p>
<p>north of the Stinky Water Creek). The area was originally part of the Chinese territory and under the jurisdiction of the Xujiahui Police Station.</p>
<p>Since the National Army moved west, it has been incorporated into the Church District, and the security issues</p>
<p>are temporarily managed by the French Police Station. Last year, in July and August,</p>
<p>refugees went there to build reed mat sheds as temporary shelters.</p>
<p>The village has a total of nine lanes from east to west, with house numbers starting from number one and going up to four hundred and thirty-five. The residents</p>
<p>are mostly from Jiangbei and Shandong, with two or three families living in each shed. Most are rickshaw pullers, street vendors,</p>
<p>and workers. At 10:40 PM the night before, a fire suddenly broke out in the home of Huang Yiqing,</p>
<p>a vegetable vendor from Gaoyou, at number 329. At that time, the north wind was howling, and sparks were flying in all directions.</p>
<p>The fire spread quickly and could not be contained. Shanghai Guoyi Hospital Clinic at 313 Xuzhen Road</p>
<p>and neighboring barbershops, teahouses, pancake shops, grocery stores, etc.</p>
<p>were also affected. Fire brigades from the English and French Concessions drove to the scene to put out the fire. However,</p>
<p>due to the lack of tap water, they used hoses to connect from the French Concession, which was quite time-consuming. The fire was finally extinguished at around one o'clock yesterday morning.</p>
<p>All 435 houses in the village were reduced to ashes. Fortunately, there were exits on all sides, and no one was killed.</p>
<p>At this time of severe winter cold, it is hoped that Shanghai philanthropists will have great compassion and quickly</p>
<p>arrange for relief. Otherwise, over a thousand refugees will inevitably face the threat of cold and hunger.</p>
<h3>Truck Accident - Jiaxing Women's Normal School Principal - Fang Ying Dies of Severe Injuries</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Women's Normal School Principal Fang Ying Dies of Severe Injuries</p>
<p>Fang Ying, the principal of Jiaxing Women's Normal School,</p>
<p>and Madam Fang, the wife of Jiang Zhixin, the director of Dexin Hospital,</p>
<p>were sisters. They came to Shanghai to seek refuge and lived</p>
<p>at Lane 194, 100 Gordon Road.</p>
<p>On the 4th, the two went out shopping together.</p>
<p>Near Avenue Foch and Seymour Road, Fang Ying was</p>
<p>hit by truck number 1716. She was sent</p>
<p>to Guangren Hospital but died due to her severe injuries. The Jiaxing</p>
<p>Shanghai Association plans to hold a memorial service on a scheduled date.</p>
<h3>Stolen Items at Japanese Military Camp - Forced to Strip Naked - Stabbed to Death by Japanese Soldiers</h3>
<p>A tragic murder case occurred in the Nantou area of Pudong</p>
<p>yesterday, resulting in the death of a fisherman. The cause of this incident</p>
<p>was extremely minor. Previously, twelve bags of wheat were stolen from a warehouse</p>
<p>on the wharf, and the perpetrators could not be found.</p>
<p>Not long ago, a large number of comfort items such as towels and socks were also stolen from</p>
<p>the Japanese military camp.</p>
<p>In an area guarded by armed soldiers, theft cases</p>
<p>occurred repeatedly, causing anger and shame. Yesterday morning at 11</p>
<p>AM, there were two fishermen near the wheat warehouse</p>
<p>casting their nets to catch fish. Suddenly, four Japanese soldiers</p>
<p>came forward to interrogate them. One of them, unable to understand the language, was</p>
<p>terrified and fled. The other was arrested and forcibly accused</p>
<p>of being the wheat thief. He was forced to strip</p>
<p>naked on the spot and then stabbed to death with guns. He was buried on the spot.</p>
<p>Those who heard this were heartbroken.</p>
<h3>Businessman Despairs Due to Debt</h3>
<p>A traveler, claiming to be Song Yonggong, 42 years old,</p>
<p>from Suzhou, arrived at Ningyu Inn on Mini Teinyin Road in the French Concession</p>
<p>at around 5 PM the day before. He was in the hardware</p>
<p>business and booked room number 77.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the approaching end of the lunar year, he suffered significant losses and could not make up for them. He</p>
<p>suddenly had the thought of ending his life. He secretly ingested raw opium</p>
<p>to commit suicide. It was not until 11 AM yesterday morning that the tea server</p>
<p>noticed and reported it to the Songshan Road Police Station, who sent a detective</p>
<p>to take him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Snow on the First Day of Spring - Sudden Change in Weather</h3>
<p>Winter was warm as spring. The night before was</p>
<p>windy all night. Yesterday was the first day of spring, but it was</p>
<p>bitterly cold. It even snowed in the morning, a</p>
<p>significant change from the previous weather. It is said</p>
<p>that the temperature in Jiangnan suddenly turned cold, which was</p>
<p>due to the southward push of the Siberian high-pressure system.</p>
<h3>Lin Chengyong Accused of Falsely Establishing a Business - Accusations of Fraud, Embezzlement, and Breach of Trust - Defendant Avoids Service of Summons - Awaiting Complainant's Notification to Summon to Court for Further Questioning</h3>
<p>Lu Ruzhou of Qixin Silk Shop, 7 Taozhu Lane, Jiujiang Road,</p>
<p>recently hired a lawyer to file a criminal accusation in the First Special</p>
<p>District Court, accusing Lin Chengyong, the owner of Zhaofeng Silk Shop,</p>
<p>of falsely establishing a business, obtaining money through fraud,</p>
<p>embezzlement, and breach of trust, along with related civil claims.</p>
<p>The facts of the lawsuit are that the plaintiff, on</p>
<p>June 15th of the previous year, through the defendant's</p>
<p>introduction, ordered ten</p>
<p>loads of "Yan Nu" brand white factory silk (a type of orchid silk)</p>
<p>from Shen, the accountant of Yonglong Silk Factory in Wuxi, at a price of 840 yuan per load, and paid a deposit of 500 yuan.</p>
<p>The deadline for full payment was set for July and August, with a</p>
<p>receipt written, with the seals of the defendant and Shen, the accountant of Yonglong Silk Factory, as proof.</p>
<p>On July 27th of the same year, the defendant claimed that the delivery date had arrived and asked the plaintiff to</p>
<p>pay 890 yuan first to release five loads of goods. The remaining amount would be secured by him through a deposit of 2,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The deposit interest</p>
<p>was 9.5 yuan per month,</p>
<p>borne by the plaintiff. The plaintiff paid the amount as required.</p>
<p>The payment of 890 yuan, evidenced by a Kangzhuang bank draft dated August 6th of the same year, was made in the name of Zhaofeng Silk Shop by the defendant.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, after that, the defendant avoided the plaintiff like Yi Xing. The</p>
<p>Zhaofeng Silk Shop and Shen, the accountant of Yonglong Factory, also disappeared without a trace.</p>
<p>Although they met once afterwards, he still used</p>
<p>evasive tactics. Therefore, according to Article</p>
<p>339 of the Criminal Law, the</p>
<p>fraud crime, and Article 335 of the same law, the</p>
<p>embezzlement crime, and Article 342 of the same law, the breach of trust crime,</p>
<p>a lawsuit was filed with your court, and because the defendant had a risk of flight, a warrant was requested</p>
<p>for arrest, ordering him to hand over five</p>
<p>loads of white factory silk and the deposit receipts for the remaining five loads, or</p>
<p>compensate for the value of ten loads of white factory silk, deducting the 7,010 yuan that the plaintiff should have paid, and the interest on the deposit, etc.</p>
<p>The case was summoned for questioning in the Criminal</p>
<p>Court 4 by Judge Liu Yugui the previous afternoon.</p>
<p>Because the defendant's address</p>
<p>was unknown, the summons</p>
<p>could not be delivered. The lawyer representing the plaintiff stated that the defendant was indeed in Shanghai and intentionally refused to accept the summons.</p>
<p>Therefore, it would be best to ask your court to approve the issuance of an arrest warrant. Otherwise, the plaintiff will notify</p>
<p>the defendant to appear. Judge Liu postponed the case for further questioning, awaiting the plaintiff's notification for the defendant to appear in court.</p>
<h3>Sheltering Street Children - Combining Education and Training - The International Relief Committee Is Handling It Very Seriously</h3>
<p>The Shanghai International Relief Committee, recognizing that street</p>
<p>children are instigated by bad people to form groups of</p>
<p>thieves, often stealing in the streets and alleys. If</p>
<p>they are not corrected, it is a loss to the country and society.</p>
<p>Therefore, on June 1st of last year, with the assistance of the Public Works Department</p>
<p>and various parties, it opened the Street Children's Vocational Education and Training Institute on Xiamen Road.</p>
<p>It is now known that the institute has bamboo work, carpentry, shoemaking,</p>
<p>towel making, mending, tailoring, and weaving,</p>
<p>all taught by experienced teachers.</p>
<p>In addition, full-time teachers are hired to implement primary education.</p>
<p>The children are divided into two groups: studying and</p>
<p>learning skills. One group attends classes, and the other group works,</p>
<p>alternating in rotation so that there is no conflict. The classrooms and</p>
<p>school supplies are complete. The dormitories are well-ventilated, and the</p>
<p>children each have their own beds. The bathroom is equipped with</p>
<p>shower baths. The factories are also quite spacious. Every day,</p>
<p>work and play are scheduled. Recently, the Public Works Department</p>
<p>ordered a large batch of basketry from the institute. All the clothes and shoes worn by the children in the institute</p>
<p>are also made by themselves. The results of the operation are deeply praised by all sectors of society.</p>

<p>Record of Yao Bolin's Birthday Banquet</p>
<p>Yao Bolin, a well-known medical writer in Shanghai's new medical community,</p>
<p>has devoted most of his life's energy to the publication</p>

<p>was his sixtieth birthday, and he held a banquet for guests at</p>
<p>Hongyun Restaurant on French Avenue. Among the relatives and friends, many presented</p>
<p>gifts of poetry and prose, a dazzling array, beautiful</p>
<p>and exquisite. Furthermore, he has a lifelong passion for music and drama, so</p>
<p>he has many friends in the amateur opera circle. They</p>
<p>performed opera to celebrate his birthday, adding to the festivities.</p>
<p>The gentleman felt that at this time, it was inappropriate to hold such a celebration, but</p>

<p>So, his friends gave him a performance.</p>
<p>The programs included "Ascending to Heaven," "Yuelai Inn," "Catching and Releasing Cao," "Chunxiang's School Frolic," "Mei Long Town," "Fen River Bay,"</p>
<p>"Sitting in the Palace," and "Trying the Head and Tattooing the Soup." The performances were all</p>
<p>vivid and wonderful. The grand finale was Guo Chunyang's "Dingjun Mountain."</p>
<p>Guo's art was taught by Yu Shuyan.</p>
<p>He has been in Shanghai for two years.</p>
<p>Although various stages have competed to hire him, Guo has been cautious</p>
<p>and reserved, not wanting to perform easily due to the uneven quality of the roles.</p>
<p>Because of his teacher-student relationship with Mr. Yao, he finally</p>
<p>showed his skills. This play is a *kaoba* old male role opera,</p>
<p>with equal emphasis on civil and military aspects, with singing and acting.</p>
<p>Guo performed with heroic spirit, outstanding and exceptional, truly</p>
<p>a masterpiece. Furthermore, according to a certain gentleman, among the amateur</p>
<p>performances that evening, in addition to Guo's "Dingjun Mountain," Xinfu Jushi's "Catching and Releasing Cao" was quite excellent.</p>
<p>Miss Ye Huimin's Chunxiang was petite and lovely, and her pronunciation</p>
<p>was clear. Her gestures were lively, and her performance was truly</p>
<p>rare and valuable. Mrs. Wang Weikang's Fengjie</p>
<p>was performed vividly. Miss Ye Wenqiu's</p>
<p>"Tattooing the Soup" showed her skilled singing and generous acting,</p>
<p>which was even more amazing. By the time the performance ended, it was</p>
<p>midnight.</p>

<h3>Proposal for Reorganizing Education in Gansu Province, Already Determined by the Gansu Education Department</h3>
<p>(Lanzhou Correspondence) The Gansu Education Department, in order to reorganize education throughout Gansu Province, to connect with frontline anti-Japanese war efforts, and to achieve practical results in anti-Japanese war education, has specially drafted a proposal for reorganizing education. The content is divided into five areas: secondary education, primary education, local education, social education, and frontier education. Regarding the reorganization of secondary and primary education, the Education Department convened the principals and teachers of various middle and primary schools. Following the principle of rationalizing personnel management, and taking into consideration the actual circumstances of each school, they discussed in detail and formulated separate improvement plans. Regarding the reorganization of local education, the Education Department convened the education bureau chiefs of fifteen counties in the First Administrative Region, and the principals of those counties, to formulate a draft plan based on actual circumstances. They also consulted with the Finance Department to compile local budget estimates, increase funding, improve the salaries of teachers and staff, and enrich and increase school classes, in order to accommodate a large number of out-of-school children. Furthermore, following the policy of integrating education and administration, a complete primary school or junior primary school will be established in each Lianbao and Bao chief's office. This will be managed concurrently by trained principals, achieving the combined effect of managing education, training, cultivation, and hygiene. In addition, a large number of trained students will be assigned to work in various counties by the provincial government, with the aim of implementing anti-Japanese war education, revitalizing rural areas, and strengthening the forces of resistance. Regarding the reorganization of social education, the provincial government will gradually extend it to various counties, and provisional measures for supplementary education for out-of-school people in the provincial capital have been established in Lanzhou. Adult classes will be established in private primary schools in various provinces and counties. In villages without schools, local temples and public places will be used to set up public schools for the people. Regarding the reorganization of frontier education, it is planned to enrich the existing Hui and Tibetan primary schools in ten counties such as Gaolan, establish Hui and Tibetan central primary schools in five counties such as Linxia, and promote compulsory education for Hui and Tibetan people in thirty-three counties such as Gaolan. To cultivate teachers for this purpose, it is also planned to establish a provincial Lanzhou Special Normal School.</p>
<p>National Christian</p>
<p>Universities' Recent Situation</p>
<p>Student Numbers Gradually Increasing</p>
<p>Since the incident last year, the relocation of the twelve National Christian Universities has been reported in this newspaper. The current locations and student numbers of each school are listed below. In the 1937 academic year, the thirteen universities had a total of 6,424 students. Due to the war, this number decreased to 4,347 in the last academic year. This academic year, due to special reasons, the number of students has recovered to 5,852, an increase of 1,505 compared to last year. However, compared to the 1937 academic year, it is still 572 students fewer. As for the distribution of students, the four schools in Shanghai (St. John's, Shanghai University, Soochow, and Hangchow University) have a total of 2,693 students, accounting for 46% of the total. The four schools in Chengdu (West China Union University, Qilu Medical College, Jinling University, and Ginling College) have a total of 1,240 students, accounting for 21% of the total. The one school in Beiping (Yanjing) has 930 students, accounting for 11% of the total. The students scattered in the four schools in Hong Kong (Lingnan University of Guangzhou, currently teaching at the University of Hong Kong), Shaowu (Fuzhou Union Theological College), Nanping (Hwa Nan College), and Guilin (Huachung University of Wuchang) account for 22% of the total.

<h3>School Overview: New China College</h3>
<p>New China College in this city was founded at 12:88 by Hu Yaomei, the Director of General Affairs and Head of the Department of Mathematics and Physics of China Public School, who gathered some professors from China Public School. After half a year of preparation, it was finally established and named New China Public School. The position of principal was held by Bai Wenwei, a director of the school board. After the war subsided, it formally requested approval from the Ministry of Education. It was approved, and the Ministry ordered that "New China Public School" be renamed New China College. At the beginning of its establishment, the school had more than 500 students, most of whom were students from China Public School. After two years of operation, the results were remarkable. Later, due to environmental reasons, it was suspended in the middle until after the "August 13" Incident. Some of the school board members, in view of the fact that universities in Shanghai had moved inland to start classes, and there were many young students who were left in Shanghai and felt the pain of losing their studies, decided to revive New China College in order to help these young people. After much planning, classes officially started in February of the 27th year of the Republic of China. Hu Yaomei, the former director of New China College and president of Zanwenli College, was elected as the president of the school. The president embraced the spirit of hard work and managed all school affairs. Shi Pin was hired as the Secretary-General, Wu Guangren as the Dean of Academic Affairs, Lu Shaoguang as the Director of Registration and Secretary, Shao Mingjiu as the Director of the Middle School Department, Hu Puan as the Dean of the School of Arts, Ling Shumo as the Dean of the School of Law, and Qiu Zhenglun as the Dean of the School of Commerce. The academic departments are: (1) School of Arts and Sciences: Department of Arts and History, Department of Education and Sociology, Department of Mathematics and Physics, Department of Chemistry; (2) School of Law: Department of Law, Department of Political Science, Department of Economics; (3) School of Commerce: Department of General Commerce, Department of Banking and Accounting; (4) Affiliated Middle School: Divided into senior and junior high levels. Since its revival, the school's affairs have been flourishing. This semester, in order to expand the scope, in addition to the original school buildings, the fifth floor of the Pudong Building and the foreign-style house at No. 826, the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Haifang Road, have been leased as the second and third school buildings. In order to sympathize with the economic difficulties of young students seeking education, the tuition fees for universities, middle schools, and primary schools have been reduced: 30 yuan for the university department, 18 yuan for the senior high school, 14 yuan for the junior high school, 10 yuan for the senior primary school, 8 yuan for the intermediate primary school, and 6 yuan for the junior primary school. The teaching is strict and does not tend to empty talk. The affiliated middle school is mostly taught by famous professors from the university department, who are responsible for various major courses. The primary school teachers have also been carefully selected.</p>

<h3>Who is Crazy?</h3>
<p>— Ming Fu</p>
<p>It seems that it was Charles who once wrote a novel about a person who ran into a country of blind people and was treated as a blind person by the people in the country. Out of pity for him and to help him, they insisted on blinding his eyes so that he could live a healthy life with them. Unable to resist, he had to escape.</p>
<p>This is of course a fable. In fact, there may not be a country of blind people. However, what is necessarily absent in reality is often present in principle. We cannot ignore this principle.</p>
<p>I once visited a mental hospital, where all kinds of crazy people were locked up. As I walked through the corridor, I heard them crying, laughing, and, most commonly, shouting and cursing incoherently. They almost all said the same thing: "Who is crazy! You are the crazy ones! I am a perfectly normal person. Why are you locking me up here?"</p>
<p>This is the same principle: clearly, they are the ones in the wrong, but they say that others are in the wrong; clearly, they are the crazy ones, but they say that others are the crazy ones, just as clearly, they are the blind ones, but they say that others are the blind ones.</p>
<p>If blind people rule the country, they will definitely make sighted people as blind as they are; similarly, if crazy people rule the country, they will make sane people as crazy as they are. If you refuse to be crazy, they will persecute you and leave you with no way out. If you want to avoid being persecuted to death by them, you have no choice but to leave. Now, in a certain civilized country, many great scientists and great thinkers have fled, which is probably proof of this principle.</p>
<p>Therefore, the country of blind people is a fable, but the country of crazy people is actually a fact. Can you believe it? Moreover, the country of crazy people is not only a unique decoration in the world, but it is actually standing firmly on its feet again and again! Their consistent style is: while they are engaged in aggressive militarism, they accuse those who spend money on self-defense of destroying peace; while they are committing all kinds of dehumanizing acts of destruction, they accuse those who strive for progress of destroying civilization; while they are disrupting order, they say that others are not obeying order;... Their tone and their momentum are exactly the same as those crazy people I saw.</p>
<p>However, the crazy people I saw were few in number and had little power, so they were finally locked up in the mental hospital by sane people and prevented from causing trouble. But these international crazy people are numerous and powerful. If the sane people of all countries in the world do not unite to lock them up in the mental hospital, I fear that the future of the world will fall into an extremely tragic fate.</p>
<p>Recently, Roosevelt's speech on maintaining peace and his willingness to be a supporter of democratic countries is regarded by every sane person as a righteous and serious statement that is enough to illuminate the annals of history. But a certain country's newspaper said that Roosevelt had already "gone mad." This is exactly the behavior of crazy people scolding others for being crazy. How can this not make me think that a certain country has simply become a mental hospital, where so many crazy people are kept!</p>
<p>In the hearts of crazy people, perhaps they are thinking that as long as they seize power and can dominate the world, they can call themselves sane people and accuse others of being crazy. Therefore, their madness is only increasing, and they simply want to turn the world upside down. However, we know that in 1815, Metternich's "Holy Alliance" was not the same as today's "Axis"? Moreover, the power of that "Alliance" was far greater than that of today's "Axis." How long did that "Alliance" last? What did the so-called "holy" ultimately mean? Today, the "Axis" accuses people of being "crazy." If it does not become "the pot calling the kettle black," no one will believe it! What is the use of power? A crazy person is still a crazy person!</p>
<p>Speaking of this, who is crazy seems to be self-evident, and I don't need to waste any more words. But I also heard a very popular joke in Europe and America, which I might as well briefly describe here as a small reference to the question of who is crazy:</p>
<p>It is said that Hitler once went to visit a mental hospital. In advance, the staff of the hospital spent a lot of effort teaching the crazy people the slogan "Long live Hitler!" When Hitler arrived, the crazy people lined up to greet him and shouted that gratifying slogan. But Hitler saw an old man who did not shout the slogan. Hitler angrily questioned him: "Crazy, why don't you shout the slogan?" The old man said indifferently: "I am not crazy; I am the gatekeeper."</p>
<h3>Reading and Writing</h3>
<p>— Xia Fu</p>
<p>——Reviewing "New Studies on Novels and Operas"</p>
<p>There are methods for writing, and there must also be methods for reading. That is to say: being able to write good articles must be from gaining insight when reading. Of course, relying solely on hearsay and piecing together a book, forcibly putting on a guise, and naming it textual research or history, this kind of phenomenon is truly too numerous to mention in Shanghai. In the past, such as Jiang Ruizao's "Textual Research on Novels," not only was the rationale unclear, but what was copied was too mixed, and even many book titles were fabricated to boast of erudition. This is one example. Another example is Wang Guowei's "History of Song and Yuan Operas," which was originally not objectionable in terms of compilation. However, he did not dare to be complacent. In his own "Chenfeng Pavilion Series," he signed it as "Textual Research on Song and Yuan Operas." Indeed, judging from the content of that book, the word "textual research" is more appropriate than the word "history." Mr. Zhao Jingshen has worked hardest on novels and operas, and has successively published "Random Notes on Reading Operas," "Idle Talk about Novels," and other works. "A pen as thick as an oak tree, a heart as fine as a hair," he can truly be called. Although he calls himself "random notes" and "idle talk," in fact, every article has extremely insightful views, hinting at his meticulously crafted reading methods. Now, his new work "New Studies on Novels and Operas" (World Book Company edition, price 5 jiao) has been published. Personally speaking, this type of book suits my taste, and after reading it, I would like to say a few words—say what I want to say.</p>
<p>In the novel section, the article that I admire the most is "Chronology of Xia Erming, Author of "Rustic Words"." This is simply using all one's strength to catch a rabbit. The materials he took are almost all those that others have not noticed. However, he made them into historical materials with authenticity. For a "Xia Clan Genealogy," he personally went to Jiangyin and visited the descendants of Xia Erming. To spend such energy on an article of less than 10,000 words can truly make those who rely solely on hearsay and are unwilling to put in actual effort ashamed to death. Now, the play "Wen Su Chen" is being performed continuously to a full house. I don't know if most people know who this Xia Erming is, and what Xiang Ling, Xuan Gu, and Hong Xuke are.</p>
<p>In "The Origins and Influences of "Timely Words to Admonish the World" and "Constant Words to Awaken the World"," he returned all eighty short stories to their mother's homes. The effort he spent was not just overnight, which is also what I admire the most. If the history of Chinese novels is reorganized using his method, I believe it will definitely be able to change its appearance. In the opera section, he expressed a new opinion whenever he read a book. Anyone who has studied zaju and legendary operas should carefully examine this point, unless they "forget their ancestors" and gloss over those things, only knowing to talk superficially about the current Peking opera.</p>
<p>In the article "Exploring the Source of Yongxi Music Palace," he actually corrected the biggest omission for those who compiled books in the Ming Dynasty, which is more practical than simply compiling a Western Chamber Romance songbook. Ma Lian's annotated "Record of Ghosts" also took a lot of effort. Under the clear vision of Mr. Zhao, he also corrected many of Ma Lian's mistakes. Unfortunately, Mr. Ma has passed away and did not have the chance to see the red ink of this fellow practitioner.</p>
<p>In short, this is a very readable book. If you are very interested in studying novels and operas, then it will be of great help to you. The lightness and fluency of the writing is just a side issue. The best thing about this book is that it reveals the author's own reading methods. His focus is on the evolution of history, and he never says a word without evidence.</p>
<h3>Our Air Force Soldiers</h3>
<p>— Zhang Meidi</p>
<p>——In Memory of My Deceased Friend, Huang Hualin</p>
<p>When the Battle of Shanghai was at its fiercest, I was still in Nanjing. The situation was tense, but the Japanese air raids were not taken lightly. Everyone shared the same hope: to hear news of Japanese planes being shot down. Traffic between Nanjing and Shanghai was intermittent, and letters from relatives and friends were also scarce. When I did receive one or two, I would cherish and read them carefully. Especially Dehua's letters, I looked forward to them every day. One day, when I found her letter on my desk, I quickly grabbed it, got into a car, and sneaked off to Houhu alone.</p>
<p>The lake was very still, with no sound of boats. The fallen leaves of the plane trees rustled. Zhongshan Mountain was also shrouded in a hazy mist. The earth was quiet, and tourists were very few. I sat on a bamboo chair, carefully reading Dehua's letter, and at the same time, I noticed a young man sitting across from me, also reading a long letter.</p>
<p>"Comrade, are you in the Air Force?" I asked abruptly, noticing the insignia of the Aviation Department on his collar.</p>
<p>"Yes, I just transferred to this post from Hangzhou," he said modestly.</p>
<p>After a few minutes of conversation, we seemed to hit it off. I first expressed my deep respect for their efforts in defending Nanjing's airspace. He replied lightly, "This is precisely the opportunity for us young people to dedicate ourselves to the motherland!" Such a powerful answer resonated in my ears, and my heart was deeply moved!</p>
<p>We chatted enthusiastically, and we got along very well. Our friendship deepened day by day, and we visited each other in our free time. He liked to drink, and I was also a lover of wine. The Fuchang Restaurant and the International Friendship Club often had us two seated there. In our two months of friendship, he left a deep impression on me. I learned about his background. He was indeed a passionate and determined young man. Tall, with a high nose, with the demeanor of the South, yet so forthright in his temperament, yet so amiable, always with a smile on his face. Wearing the leather coat given by Madame Chiang, he looked particularly heroic, and everyone who saw him would praise him.</p>
<p>Huang Hualin, isn't the name very sonorous? He was from Zhongshan County. His father was a Nanyang overseas merchant. He had no brothers or sisters, only a fiancée, Miss Lin, who was still studying at the University of Hong Kong. The letter he was reading at Houhu that day was Miss Lin's letter of encouragement from Xiangdao!</p>
<p>He was a graduate of the Aviation School. When the August 13th Shanghai Incident occurred, he participated in the bombing of the Izumo warship and other operations, achieving great merit and earning the trust of his superiors. He was now responsible for the air defense of the capital. Therefore, whenever the air raid sirens sounded, our brave Air Force would be dispatched to prepare for battle, soaring into the sky. I always thought, perhaps my good friend is piloting the plane?</p>
<p>Today, the sky is very clear. I subconsciously anticipated that Japanese planes would definitely come to raid. Sure enough, in an instant, the air raid sirens blared loudly. Today, Japanese planes divided into four groups, attacking the capital, totaling seventy-eight aircraft. Our heroic Air Force also dispatched a large force, dealing a heavy blow to the Japanese planes. At the same time, anti-aircraft guns and anti-aircraft machine guns formed a dense fire net, firing intensely. The sky had turned into a world of torches, becoming an unprecedented spectacle.</p>
<p>"Today, nineteen Japanese planes were shot down!"</p>
<p>When I heard the news of this victory at my brother's house, I was extremely excited. My friend must be fighting too! I thought. "Sir, a phone call, from the Central Hospital," the servant came over and called. I was suddenly startled and went to answer it.</p>
<p>"Is this Mr. Zhang? A Mr. Huang wants to say a few words to you, please come quickly!"</p>
<p>I drove to the Central Hospital. There at the entrance, a nurse in white stopped me. "Are you Mr. Zhang? Alas! You are five minutes late. Comrade Huang has gloriously passed away! He died gloriously: he shot down two Japanese planes, but unfortunately suffered several gunshot wounds himself. He was still able to calmly bring the plane down safely. When he arrived at the hospital, he instructed that you be asked to see him. Alas! Only five minutes too late!" She handed me a piece of paper with handwriting on it, with only a few simple words:</p>
<p>Good friends:</p>
<p>I'm leaving first. For the sake of the motherland, please continue your efforts! Okay! Take care! Work hard!</p>
<p>I blanked out and lost consciousness. I don't know when or who sent me back to my brother's house.</p>
<p>Now, Houhu has been ravaged by the enemy into who knows what state. Dehua has also fled to who knows where. But I don't think about her; I only often miss my brave friend: sleep well! I will always remember you. Let me tell you: the dawn of victory has unfolded. (Fees for refugees)</p>
<h3>Still the Same Old Story.</h3>
<p>Novella</p>
<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>At this moment, a burst of commotion suddenly erupted on the street outside, vaguely sounding like many people shouting, "Look at the planes!" "Look at the planes!" The voices of conversation at the table suddenly ceased, and everyone listened intently to the outside. After a while, several people couldn't resist and ran to the courtyard first, and then simply ran to the street. Regiment Commander Ye also slowly followed behind, seeing a large crowd gathered on the street, chattering noisily, he couldn't help but frown secretly, feeling that they had no military common sense at all, and quickly shouted:</p>
<p>"Disperse quickly, don't crowd together, be careful of being targeted by enemy planes!"</p>
<p>Although everyone noticed his military uniform, no one was willing to listen to him, still crowding together and not dispersing. Regiment Commander Ye had no choice but to take out the binoculars he carried with the army to look at the sky. There were three silver-gray planes flying in the sky, arranged in a T-shape, with two fighter planes protecting a heavy bomber. He couldn't help but stomp his foot and say:</p>
<p>"Don't hurry up and disperse, the one in the back is a bomber, it will drop bombs."</p>
<p>Just as he was saying this, the planes in the sky suddenly descended, and began to fire machine guns "ka ka ka ka," for a moment bullets jumped like raindrops on the rooftops and the ground with a "pop pop" sound. Someone in the crowd had already shouted "Ouch!" and fell to the ground, unable to get up. Then, the people in the street let out a cry, and everyone scattered in a burst. The several guests who were accompanying Regiment Commander Ye at the table all fled in a panic toward the public office. Although Town Chief Chen and Elder Mr. Ye had not moved, looking at the panicked appearance of everyone, they couldn't help but be frightened, their faces pale.</p>
<p>Then there was another very loud "Boom!" The ground shook violently, and several wine glasses on the table were overturned, and wine spilled all over the ground.</p>
<p>Regiment Commander Ye returned to the courtyard and saw that the three planes had circled the town once and followed Taihu Lake, slowly flying towards the northwest. Only when he could no longer see the shadows did he come in, walk around Elder Mr. Ye, and bid farewell to Town Chief Chen.</p>
<p>Town Chief Chen, while calling all the guests to accompany them, still earnestly urged Elder Mr. Ye and Regiment Commander Ye to finish the meal before leaving. But in such a situation, Elder Mr. Ye was naturally unwilling to stay long, and even the guests were restless, and no matter how delicious the delicacies were, they couldn't swallow them. Finally, everyone agreed to let this welcoming feast end hastily, and respectfully escorted the two distinguished guests all the way to the entrance of the township office. Town Chief Chen kept saying:</p>
<p>"I'm sorry! I'm sorry!" (5)</p>

<p>Conversation</p>
<h3>Should Rickshaw Pullers Be Able to Read and See Newspapers?</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, I passed through Japan and saw many rickshaw pullers reading newspapers by the roadside.</p>
<p>How many rickshaw pullers in Shanghai today can read newspapers? Five or six years ago, the rickshaw puller problem was very serious in Shanghai. Chinese and foreigners alike loudly called for their happiness. Soon after, the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association was established.</p>
<p>The work of the Mutual Aid Association has achieved considerable success to this day, such as diseases being treated, children being admitted to schools, disputes being resolved, and lives being improved. This cannot but be attributed to the efforts of the directors of the Mutual Aid Association. However, there is still room for improvement in the area of education. Although the association has popular lectures to disseminate hygiene knowledge and a reading room for browsing, it is a pity that it has not yet established a school so that more than 90% of the illiterate rickshaw pullers can read and see newspapers.</p>
<p>Everyone cannot deny that rickshaw pullers should be able to read and see newspapers. But some people think that rickshaw pullers are in a difficult situation, with difficult lives, working hard all day long, and still unable to get enough to eat and stay warm, so how can they have time to study and learn to read? I deeply sympathize with the difficult lives of rickshaw pullers: no one sympathizes with the fact that rickshaw pullers should be illiterate. On the one hand, we improve the lives of rickshaw pullers, and on the other hand, we should give rickshaw pullers the opportunity to learn to read.</p>
<p>It is hoped that the directors of the Mutual Aid Association will be responsible for promoting this matter. I hope that in the near future, rickshaw pullers can be seen everywhere in Shanghai reading newspapers!</p>
<h3>Talking About Education for Refugee Children (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Tang Qingkai</p>
<p>Indeed, the education of refugee children is very different from ordinary primary school education, and it cannot be known without practical experience. Now, let me explain the differences separately. Regarding equipment: In the simple shelter, it is mostly difficult to find a suitable classroom, let alone equipment. Without desks and chairs, the refugee children stand to attend classes. If the hours are longer, they will easily become tired, and there is simply no way to practice calligraphy and copying.</p>
<p>Regarding the organization of grades: The refugees in the shelter are mobile, so the number of people increases and decreases suddenly. Complex, single-grade teaching is not enough to cope with the situation. The number of people in each grade varies greatly, the level of refugee children is uneven and complex, the level of textbooks cannot be adjusted, and the daily allocation of class time cannot meet the points of general education. Indeed, running refugee children's education in a shelter is a special kind of education, without a fixed way to stipulate it. Teachers must adapt to the situation and adjust and cope with it. Regarding the curriculum: There is no major difference between the curriculum for refugee children and ordinary schools. For example, compulsory subjects in ordinary schools such as Chinese, arithmetic, common sense, physical education, music, and drawing, as well as nursery rhymes and storytelling suitable for kindergarten classes, are all available in refugee children's classes, but the time and speed are not as good as ordinary primary schools. How to improve in a harsh environment is worth studying. Regarding teaching materials, except for Chinese and arithmetic, which have textbooks, teachers have to find materials for other subjects. The author has seen some shelters that specialize in teaching Chinese and arithmetic, while neglecting other subjects. I think the problem of finding materials is also a reason, especially since the scope of common sense lessons is very wide, and reference books should be provided to teachers as much as possible.</p>
<p>Regarding implementation: Talking about education to children is purely mental education, belonging to the infusion of spirit. For children who have been displaced, the role of spiritual education cannot be ignored. Therefore, some people advocate that the implementation of refugee children's education should be based on love. Reading and writing are a last resort. As for class time, it is felt that 7:00 to 10:00 in the morning and 2:00 to 4:00 in the afternoon are most suitable in the shelter, at least three hours a day. Extracurricular activities are also indispensable. Probably because of the unstable life, refugee children generally feel painful in the classroom and have no intention of attending classes. To make refugee children feel interested, teachers must use a way of speaking with spirit to influence them.</p>
<p>In all fairness, being able to actively run education in the harsh environment of the shelter cannot be considered a kind of painstaking effort. In addition to sympathy, I hope to further promote it, organize and educate all the refugees in the city in a sound manner. In this great era, extraordinary education is by no means "education for education's sake" but "education for saving the country." (The End)</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Life</p>
<h3>Yuan Mazi (Pockmarked Yuan)</h3>
<p>— Master</p>
<p>When the Shanghai War broke out, Yuan Mazi lost his job. He took the refugee relief society's ship and returned to his hometown. With little savings and nothing to farm, how could he not feel the fear of life? He knew very well the old saying "sitting and eating, even a mountain will be emptied." Looking for a job? In this time of war and increasing unemployment, it was even more difficult. He could only rely on his past honesty, borrow some capital, and set up a stall in front of the post office to sell daily necessities such as cigarettes, matches, and soap, temporarily making a living and avoiding starvation. As the war shifted westward, his hometown suddenly became a paradise for people from Jiangnan to take refuge, and the number of vendors like him increased accordingly. As a result, Yuan Mazi's business declined, which made him feel increasingly strained. But he did not become negative because of this. He thought of other ways to make money. He ordered one or two copies of the Shanghai Shen Bao and the local daily newspaper and created the so-called "open-air reading place," charging four cents. His motto was "spend a little money to read several kinds of newspapers." In general, many people who wanted to know the war situation came to see it, but the Shen Bao was sometimes interrupted due to postal service, which caused his "open-air reading place" to die prematurely. He also knew very well that in this era of commercial warfare, goods must be novel or have a speculative nature in order to avoid being eliminated. Seeing that epidemics were prevalent, he sold timely medicines. In autumn and winter, he changed to selling stationery, vaseline, and frostbite oil needed by children. He also used his experience of often seeing advertisements in Shanghai to promote on the walls near his stall with simple pictures or words, which was not without some harvest. Those who passed by his stall saw that he had more products to sell and the stall had expanded. Was this not his success in striving?</p>
<p>Folktale</p>
<h3>Chen Erlang</h3>
<p>— A Da</p>
<p>The city of Jiangyin was captured by the Qing troops. The Qing troops attacked Jiangyin for more than eighty days, and the dead and wounded were countless. This time, Jiangyin was captured. For the sake of revenge, the Qing troops entered the city and killed everyone, regardless of age. They killed so much that the city was full of blood and corpses were piled up like mountains. It was very tragic. Even today, the elderly people of Jiangyin cannot forget the situation at that time. They talk about it with relish.</p>
<p>It was the third day after the Qing troops ordered the sealing of the knives. There were still no people in the streets and alleys. The Qing troops walked by, hating that they had not killed enough Jiangyin people, because they did not see a single person. Suddenly, a Qing soldier saw a corpse on the pile of corpses by the road moving. He could not help but hesitate. Was it a zombie? Was it a wild dog? He did not know. After staring at it once, he said in surprise, "Oh, oh, it turns out to be a person, the opportunity has come!" Saying that, he drew out his waist knife!</p>
<p>Indeed, it was a person, and it was a child of eight or nine years old. He had been hiding in the pile of corpses for four days. This time, he was so hungry that he had to risk crawling out. He was covered in blood, but after wiping it away, it was obvious that he was an innocent and lovely child, with delicate eyebrows and a pitiful appearance, showing a naive childishness, which made the Qing soldier's murderous intent disappear completely, and he felt that he was cute.</p>
<p>"Little fellow, come over, I won't kill you!" The Qing soldier called to him like this, and he fearlessly ran over. "Hey, little fellow, what's your surname?"</p>
<p>"My surname is Chen, people call me Chen Erlang." The child's answer touched the Qing soldier's heart even more. The Qing soldier had been fighting for more than ten years and only knew how to kill. He had never experienced the natural joy between people. Now, hearing Erlang's answer, he laughed out loud, feeling that the little fellow was very funny. "Hey, Erlang, why don't you stay with me?" "Okay, I'll stay with you." "Do you like me?" "I like you." So Erlang went back with the Qing soldier. The Qing soldier bought a few clothes for Erlang in the clothing store. Therefore, he attracted everyone's admiration in the Qing camp, and everyone liked to play with him, and he went in and out of the Qing camp, and it was not surprising. But this matter was heard by the Qing general, who ordered Erlang to be summoned to see him. Everyone was worried about Erlang, thinking that it was mostly bad luck. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>This Week's War Situation</h3>
<p>Looking at the war situation as a whole this week, the Japanese army has made little progress. Although they want to attack Beihai in the south and invade the border of Shaanxi in the west, there are many difficulties ahead. The situation on each battlefield is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Area</p>
<p>The Japanese troops along the Yuehan, Guangzhou-Kowloon, and Guangzhou lines have been quiet recently, and the war seems to be silent. After Huaxian was occupied by the Japanese army's two or three thousand superior troops last week, it was actively counterattacked by the army, and it was officially recovered. In addition, the Japanese troops who attacked the Huashajing position have been defeated and retreated towards Taiping under the joint attack of a certain division and local troops. Therefore, the Japanese army in Guangzhou has once again entered the heavy encirclement of the Chinese army. As for the Japanese army on 灟zhou Island, although there are more than two thousand, most of them are Taiwanese, Korean, and Shandong puppet troops, with very few regular troops. There is currently only one small aircraft carrier in the ocean near Beihai, and the rest are patrolling without a fixed location.</p>
<p>Shanxi Area</p>
<p>Since the Chinese army in Jinxi captured important strongholds such as Jixian, Daning, Xiangning, and Puxian last week, the Japanese army was greatly angered. They turned around and made plans from the southwest triangle of Jin (according to the report, this is the place where the Japanese army has spent months and sacrificed the most). The Chinese army positions in Zhongtiao Mountain were fiercely attacked, and they wanted to lay the foundation for future westward progress in the triangular area. Therefore, three thousand Japanese troops with seven cannons attacked Zhongtiao Mountain from Xiexian in three routes. At the same time, another two thousand Japanese troops were sent to attack Heshun from Jinxi and Jinyang in the east, echoing from afar. After the Chinese army fought desperately, the encirclement has now been lifted. The Japanese army in Xiexian is said to have retreated, but the Japanese army in Heshun is still very stubborn. China has withdrawn automatically for strategic reasons. However, the Japanese army at the Guandi Temple suffered heavy losses due to the Chinese army's brave resistance. The two sides offset each other and reached a balance.</p>
<p>Hunan and Hubei Area The war in northern Hunan is calm. Most of the Japanese troops stationed in the Yueyang area have withdrawn to Hubei, concentrating on Huangpi and Xiaogan, seemingly preparing for some action. However, the Japanese side has not benefited from the battles in Jingshan in central Hubei and Xihe in northern Hubei in recent days. Although Jingshan and Tianmen fell one after another last week, Jingshan was once recovered after the Chinese army fought bravely. They are still in mixed battle with the Japanese army. In the battle of Xihe, the Japanese troops suffered considerable losses, and it is expected that the war will definitely turn around. Because the results of the war in the past week have actually explained the situation of the Japanese side's strength.</p>
<p>Other Areas In Henan, the Japanese army in northern Henan attacked the main force of the Chinese army from Boai and Xiuwu with a force of two or three thousand this week. The Chinese army has been effective in blocking them. In southern Anhui, more than three thousand Japanese troops who attacked the Chinese army from Wanzhi this week were continuously resisted by the Chinese army. According to reports, the Japanese side sacrificed more than one-third of them. In Hebei, the Chinese and Japanese forces had a fierce battle in Julu. The situation is unclear. In Suiyuan, after the Japanese army's attack failed last week, there is no major change. However, the puppet troops (4th and 6th divisions) stationed in the Guyang and Wuchuan areas have defected one after another in recent days.</p>
<h3>I</h3>
<p>— Editing Reporter</p>
<p>"I" is the term for "person." Heaven did not give birth to "I," it gave birth to "person" first. Only with "person" can "I" be seen. Looking at "I" in my eyes, of course, it is "I"; looking at "I" in the eyes of a person, it is "person."</p>
<p>Therefore, person and I are originally one. If everyone has no food to eat, it is difficult for me to eat my fill alone; if everyone has no clothes to wear, it is difficult for me to stay warm alone; if everyone has no house to live in, it is difficult for me to live in peace alone. I eat rice, people eat porridge; I wear fur, people wear cotton clothes; I live in a house, people live in a shelter. However, the "I" who eats rice, wears clothes, and lives in a house must at least ensure that the "person" has porridge to eat, cotton clothes to wear, and a shelter to live in. Therefore, saving "person" is saving "I." To put it more clearly, it is not saving "person," but saving "I." Even the most foolish person, how could they not even save "I"?</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Suicide</h3>
<p>— Geng</p>
<p>Suicide is the most despicable and cowardly act, so the general public only hates suicide and does not pity it.</p>
<p>Suicides want to repent of the cause of suicide by means of suicide, so it is most despicable, and they want to eliminate the difficulties of life by dying, so it is most cowardly. Although it is said that there are many causes of suicide, some are due to unbearable economic oppression, some are due to fighting for freedom of marriage, some are due to the counterattacks of the environment and personnel, some are due to quarrels, and some are due to venting anger, but the loss of reason and the overflow of courage of suicides should ultimately be hated by society.</p>
<p>Since Shanghai has been reduced to an isolated island, there have been more suicides than before. The social page of this newspaper almost has records of suicide news every day, and there are two or three cases every day. The trend of suicide can be said to be very strong!</p>
<p>From these many suicides, it is reflected how difficult life is on the isolated island, how complex the personnel are, and how bad the environment is. For example: As recorded on the social page of this newspaper on the 3rd:</p>
<p>Zhang Liansheng from Yancheng, 41 years old, worked as an accountant in the Meiwuzhai food store on Hankou Road. Recently, he heard that gambling was rampant in western Shanghai, which aroused his curiosity. He secretly went to the gambling dens after closing the market every night, hoping to get lucky, but how could there be a perfect treasure in a tiger pit? Therefore, in less than a few nights, he had lost all his blood and sweat savings, and even delayed the store's account by 50 yuan. The end of the month was approaching, and there was really no way to make up for it. In a moment of desperation, fearing that he would have no face to see anyone, he swallowed poison and committed suicide. This is telling us: how dangerous the traps set up in the so-called Wangdao Paradise on the edge of the isolated island are, and how poisonous and terrible the "prosperity policy" implemented by the puppet organization built on the enemy's bayonet is!</p>
<p>Regarding the incidents of people losing their lives in gambling dens in western Shanghai, we have often heard of them. What is more noteworthy is the suicide by jumping from the International Hotel by waiter Sang Guocai and the Zhang Liansheng incident now. We firmly believe that the general public will not give erroneous sympathy to the suicides of Sang and Zhang, but will rather spit on them. The reason is very simple. The enemy has set up traps to lure you into their clutches. Why act like a moth to a flame and seek your own destruction? Moreover, gambling is originally a sin and should not be curious or hope to get lucky.</p>
<p>However, to be fair, the responsibility for the crime of suicide should of course be borne by the suicide, but the work of eliminating the objective factors of suicide cannot be shirked by the general social workers.</p>
<h3>Outside the Drama Stage</h3>
<p>— Qu Shigong</p>
<p>Xu Yu, this popular figure of the "Analects School" and "Cosmic Wind," readers who enjoy humorous writing, probably all know his name.</p>
<p>The gentleman currently writing the "Wednesday Drama Lecture" every Tuesday in "Jina" is none other than the humorous writer Xu Yu.</p>
<p>Isn't it strange? How did Xu Yu start writing "Drama Lectures"?</p>
<p>Now, let me tell you.</p>
<p>Nine years ago, in 1930, Xu Yu had just left Peking University in Beiping. Together with Xie Xing, a graduate of the National Beiping Art Academy, Yu Qizhong, brother of "Salome" Yu Shan, Gong Manman of Jinling University, Gong Jiazhen (pen name Pin Pin) of Jinan Drama Experimental Academy, and Xu Suxue, who was good at singing foreign songs, and dozens of others, they organized a "Time and Space Society" in Beiping. Their publishing department had issued two weekly magazines, "Time" and "Space-Time Movement". Their drama department traveled south to Suzhou on February 11, 1931, and performed "The Miser" (a five-act play by Moliere), "The Mute Wife" (a two-act play by Anatole France), and "One Night Too Many" (a one-act play by Xu Yu) and other three plays in the Dongfang Grand Theater of the North Bureau.</p>
<p>Xu Yu's drama life can be said to have started at this time. At that time, I happened to be in Suzhou and had seen Xu Yu star in "The Miser" and had also seen his play "One Night Too Many." Speaking from my impression, his acting skills were quite good. The only shortcoming was the lack of connection between movements, which might be considered good by outsiders, because some viewers at the time said his performance was very delicate. As for the script, I really dare not compliment it; it had no stage effect at all.</p>
<p>Speaking of their first day of performance, it happened to be a snowy day. Snowflakes fell from the sky all day long, and the ground was covered with thick snow. The "business" was extremely miserable. In the huge theater, only the first few rows of seats were sparsely occupied by a dozen or so spectators. On the second and third days, although the box office was somewhat better, the number of spectators was still less than thirty or forty.</p>
<p>They had originally planned to perform a second time two months later, but unexpectedly, they were met with coldness from the people of Suzhou, and they had no choice but to cancel this plan. Soon, the Time and Space Society also stopped operating in any visible way, and only rented a correspondence address at "No. 31 Shijia Lane" in Suzhou.</p>
<p>Xu Yu's drama life also ended at this time.</p>
<p>Of course, in these short few years, Xu Yu had been exposed to drama theory. But to say that he had done any kind of research, that would be hard to convince anyone.</p>
<p>Xu Yu, you say you are "like a bald camel entering and exiting the thorns," I hope you say less empty words, return to the drama circle, and strive to shoulder the important task of the national salvation movement!</p>
<h3>Sorrowful Sounds from the Radio</h3>
<p>— Su Ying</p>
<p>Although there is a radio in my house, I am not very interested in it. Because after the fall of Shanghai, I can no longer hear the magnificent songs and solemn speeches that I like. It is rare to hear something more pleasing to the ear: either it is dizzying and brain-wracking, or it is weird and decadent music. Therefore, I simply put it aside and do not turn it on, which is quieter.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, for the "broadcast promotion conference of the Children's Education and Care Center," I exceptionally turned on the radio covered in dust, and the whole family sat around listening quietly.</p>
<p>At first, it was a reporter's appeal for the children, but later came the voice of a child, who seemed to be only thirteen or fourteen years old. He opened his mouth and said:</p>
<p>"Listeners, I bow to you here!..."</p>
<p>The voice was strangely miserable, which made us listen more quietly.</p>
<p>"I am thirteen years old this year and from Zhenjiang. Last autumn, I lost my only parents in the chaos. Because I have no relatives, I can only sleep on the side of the road. Later, I met a kind person in his thirties, who introduced me here (Children's Education and Care Center) and paid for my care for six years. Now I can live here in peace, all thanks to him. If this gentleman is also listening, I am very sincerely grateful here..."</p>
<p>At this time, my mother and wife were staring at the radio with their mouths open, moved by the child's broadcast.</p>
<p>"Listeners, I bow to you a second time! Because our education and care center does not just give us enough to eat, but also hires teachers to teach us, so that we will not become useless people who only know how to eat in the future. However, our place is too small, and there are still a constant stream of people as unfortunate as me, so I want to ask all kind-hearted people to donate more to save this group of pitiful little lives. Originally, I was also the son of a good family, with food and clothing, and never asked anyone for a penny. Now my dad... Mom..."</p>
<p>As he said this, he couldn't help but cry out in pain, thinking of his parents.</p>
<p>Shanghai has hundreds of thousands of radios, and there must be many who heard this broadcast. I hope they will help these suffering children more!</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Jade Ambition</h3>
<p>— Ruhua</p>
<p>Produced by Yihua Film Company, showing at the Xinguang Grand Theater, "Jade Ambition," like "A Couple in a Sea and Sky Love Story," is a pre-war production of Yihua Film Company, and it was not completed. After work was resumed, due to personnel changes after the war, this film did not achieve the expected excellence, which is naturally very regrettable.</p>
<p>However, from the essence of the film, "Jade Ambition" has not diminished its value because it is an "unfinished work." It is an anti-warlord film, depicting the people who are trying to survive under the iron hooves in the era of warlord autocracy and how they are eagerly seeking the arrival of light. Everyone, every heart, for justice, towards the light, is determined to unite, using their flesh and blood to strive for "the final victory." Wang Zhiqun's tragic whipping and the old man in the clock tower's tragic death under the whip, with this spirit of moving forward in succession, finally extinguished the remnants of the warlords represented by Brigade Commander Qin. Therefore, the public screening of "Jade Ambition" "at this time and place" gives us the encouragement to continue this spirit of moving forward in succession, and further strengthens our belief in moving towards the path of victory!</p>
<p>From what we see on the screen now, the director has also done his best to expose the unscrupulous actions of the warlords and the arduousness of the revolutionary party members. For example, at the beginning of the film, he depicts the lackeys of the warlords preying on the people, killing Zhang Ming's parents, and the subsequent whipping of revolutionary party members, etc.</p>
<p>There are also several commendable scenes individually, such as Brigade Commander Qin's birthday celebration: The director first writes about Qin Yuying introducing Hu Gang and Wu Juanfen to meet each other; Wu Juanfen flirting with Hu Gang in the backyard; although Qin Yuying feels unhappy, when Wang Zhiqun asks Hu Gang about it, she asks Zhiqun to accompany her to the theater to avoid breaking Hu Gang and Wu Juanfen's secret. When Zhang Ming assassinated him, and the sound of gunfire erupted, the director handled the complex emotions from many aspects quite well. Secret meeting: He writes it like this: party members send letters to all parties; Wang Zhiqun goes in disguise; Wu Juanfen discovers a secret note; Wu Juanfen calls Hu Gang, but Qin Yuying answers the phone; Brigade Commander Qin receives the phone call; knowing where the revolutionary party members are meeting; Qin Yuying rushes to Wu Juanfen's place, snatches the note and reports it to the party members. After the revolutionary party members are arrested, Wang Zhiqun is whipped, and the old man in the clock tower cannot bear to see this tragic situation and is willing to confess to atone for his sins, and the scenes of being forced to the clock tower to strike the bell are also tense. After Zhang Ming's assassination, he escapes to Hu Gang's bedroom, where he meets Wu Juanfen, who entangles with him and refuses to leave. Finally, she sleeps on Hu Gang's bed. At this time, Wu Juanfen is sleeping on the bed, Zhang Ming is hiding under the bed, and Hu Gang is sitting blankly on the sofa. This is a very interesting scene.</p>
<p>However, the weaving connection is a little chaotic, which makes the development of the whole play quite abrupt. The writing also has problems: the relationship between Wang Zhiqun and Wu Juanfen is not obvious enough: Qin Yuying's infatuation with Hu Gang lacks a process. Before participating in the revolutionary party meeting, Wang Zhiqun's character is unknown. In particular, there are too many coincidences, and at the end, when "mutinies break out everywhere and the city is on fire," it ends with Wang Zhiqun shooting Wu Juanfen, without even the whereabouts of Brigade Commander Qin, which are all big shortcomings.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Wen Yimin's old man in the clock tower is the best, calm and powerful. Yuan Meiyun's Zhang Ming, Wang Yin's Hu Gang, and Wang Naidong's Wang Zhiqun are all competent. Fan Xuepeng's Wu Juanfen is a bit pretentious.</p>
<h3>Written After the Collection of Miscellanea</h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>Brother Lingxi has selected more than 100,000 words of essays he has written in recent years and printed them into a single book, which is truly a gratifying piece of news.</p>
<p>I am very happy to read Lingxi's essays. For five or six years, I have been reading them almost continuously. I feel that in his essays, even a scale or a claw, two or three words, all invariably express a sincere heart, burning with a strong sense of justice. Coupled with a simple and beautiful style, readers feel like they are facing an old friend, under a melon shed and bean trellis, and with respected friends, talking frankly and openly.</p>
<p>Of course, these essays also reflect the changing Chinese society in recent years.</p>
<p>I am very happy about the publication of this collection of essays. At the same time, I hope that in the near future, Brother Lingxi will be able to publish more developed collections of essays.</p>

<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Episode 3: Admiring the Portraits and Remembering the Old Martyrs, Asking the Illiterate to Learn from Little Teachers</p>
<p>He Liyu said, "We have heard about it abroad, but we don't know the details." Jin Danyun said, "Like Old Father Huang, asking his grandson to teach him is practicing the little teacher system. Probably teaching adults with children is more effective than teaching children with adults. Because children naturally have their lovable and delightful aspects, unlike adults, who put on a stern face. Last year, I saw a primary school student's diary, which was written by a little girl student. She wrote: 'Today I taught grandma a lesson, but she refused to read it because she said she was busy. Later, I cried. She had no choice but to follow me and take that lesson.' Grandma refused to study, and the granddaughter cried. Isn't this a joke? However, in the prevailing little teacher system, this seems ordinary." Lin Jiancheng said, "The elderly learning from the young has become popular in China after the war. Near where I live, there is an adult education school. There are also several old women who go to school happily every day. When school is over, people nearby who know her greet her and ask, 'Hey! Old lady, are you dismissed from school?' When I hear it, I feel strangely unfamiliar. I have only ever heard: Little officials are dismissed from school, little girls are dismissed from school, that's what I'm used to hearing. Old lady dismissed from school, but it feels special. But this is ultimately a good phenomenon." The four people left the library, and Jin Danyun wanted to lead them to see other places. However, the sun was already setting in the west, and the two He family ladies wanted to go back. Because they wanted to go to Freedom Village tomorrow and tidy up their father's affairs after returning. Mr. He has come to Shanghai this time, and the two ladies have been temporary secretaries for a few days. Seeing that they wanted to go back, Jin Danyun didn't dare to keep them too much, because touring around everywhere is also very hard. When returning, Jin Danyun drove the car first, and then Lin Jiancheng took over. The two He family ladies can also drive cars themselves, but they are not very proficient. Moreover, they are new to Shanghai and not very familiar with the routes. Recently, the number of private cars in Shanghai has naturally increased compared to before. But there is a principle: people who have cars must be able to drive cars themselves. Except for elderly people and children, as well as people who are deaf and blind, and whose hands and feet are not agile. In particular, wives, people who have cars at home, or who have cars themselves, must be able to drive cars themselves. Because there are very few people who hire drivers now, unless it is in that kind of large car dealership, which has special cars for people to hire for business trips. In a family, both husband and wife can drive cars, and both husband and wife have jobs outside, going out and coming in together, how convenient that is! (32)</p>

<h3>Picking Up Old Records from the Singing Stage</h3>
<p>— Junmei</p>
<p>The Northern newspaper reported that Jin Shaomei, who was once extremely popular, has been living in extreme poverty in Zhangjiakou since her separation from the clown Ma Shaoshan, and has even degenerated into a lowly woman in a brothel. According to Shao Xiang, she is the daughter of the Kunqu actress Jin Yuemei. Since childhood, she has been literate and intelligent, and her hearing is exceptionally sharp. When she grew up, she learned Qingyi and Huashan dramas from Jiang Shunxian, a disciple of Shi Xiaofu, and added her mother's insights, so her attainments were extremely profound, and her demeanor was generous. Her appearance was definitely unmatched by other Kunqu actresses at that time. Shaomei's performances can best reflect the plot. When there is joy, she must express it to the fullest; when there is sorrow, she must express it to the fullest. Therefore, when she performed at the Youyi Garden in the south of the capital, most of those who admired her were elderly people with white hair and young ladies. Seeing her joy, they smiled; seeing her sorrow, their hearts ached and tears followed. They even organized old people's associations and ladies' groups to support her strongly. For a time, her fame was almost on par with Xi Kui. But how long ago was this? She has fallen to such a state. For those in this industry, five years is a lifetime. In terms of her heyday, it is indeed so. But the tragedy of the outcome seems to be beyond what was initially expected. Thinking of the line "Powder boxes and rouge tins are discarded, tears are like mud day and night," Shaomei must have unbearable memories!</p>
<p>The play "Battle of Wan City" has gradually become a cold play in recent times. This play includes a variety of roles, whether it is Sheng, Dan, Jing, Chou, or Mo. If Zhang Xiu's Sheng, Zou Shi's Dan, Cao Cao's Jing, Dian Wei's martial arts, and Hu Che'er's somersault, if the pairing is not complete, one would never dare to perform it lightly. In the play, Zhang Xiu's role is played by a Wusheng or a Laosheng. Judging from the plot, it is orthodox to use Wusheng to play the role. As for using Laosheng to play this role, Lao Tan was the originator. However, Lao Tan was originally a Wusheng, so his performance was naturally outstanding. Contemporary actors do not have Lao Tan's Wugong, so their performance cannot avoid the ridicule of imitating Dong Shi. The compiler believes that Xiao Long Peng, a famous actor in the Jianghu troupe, is very popular in this play. His precision of reciting and singing, his excellence in martial arts, and his subtlety and appropriateness of expression are truly unique. For example, when Zhang Xiu surrendered to Cao Cao, Cao Cao entered the city to watch his soldiers perform their formations. Xiu bowed his head and walked because he was overwhelmed with emotion. He then bumped into Xu Chu and Dian Wei. Here, Xiao Long Peng is humble, respectful, and flattering to Dian Wei, as if he cannot overcome his fear; and he only nods slightly to Xu Chu, showing a perfunctory attitude. Because Xiu only fears Dian Wei in Cao Cao's company. He does not want to lower his head to show weakness to Xu Chu and others. However, the usual actors have the same expression when they bump into each other. When Xiu heard that his aunt Zou Shi was robbed and went to Cao's camp to inquire, Cao Cao casually ordered Zou's maid Chunmei to serve tea. When common actors perform this, they must try their best to describe their shock and anger. In fact, Xiu should naturally have a shocked and angry expression when he suddenly sees this situation, but given Cao Cao's suspicion, Xiu would never dare to show it on his face. Therefore, Xiao Long Peng only reveals a hint of shock and anger at this time to show that he does not care at all, which is quite empathetic and reasonable for Zhang Xiu. In the past twenty years, I have seen famous actors perform this play, and he is far superior to them! Compared with Ying Xiu back then, he is naturally inferior, but being confined to the Jianghu troupe is all the more unfortunate for his mother!</p>
<h3>Talking about Dan</h3>
<p>— Aiping Studio Owner</p>
<p>Dan is divided into Zhengdan Huadan, Lao Dan, Caidan, and Wudan. Zhengdan is also called Qingyi, also known as Qingshan, which represents virtuous women and chaste women. The most important thing is singing, such as Sun Furen in "Sacrificing to the River", Wang Chun'e in "Teaching Son", and Luo Fu in "Sangyuanhui".</p>
<p>Huadan is what Kunqu opera calls Tie, which represents adulterous and fierce women, known for their reciting and acting. The Minmen, Wanxiao, and Daoma categories, such as the Dan roles in "Xiaoshangfen", "Shuangyaohui", and "Damianjiang", "Dinghuazhuan" and other plays, are all Wanxiao Dan. As for the Dan roles in "Mashangyuan", "Mukezhai" and "Hongniguan", they are Daoma Dan, dancing with swords and guns, with beautiful posture as the main focus, and it is not necessary to be good at martial arts fighting, so they are classified as Huadan. Those in between Qingyi and Huadan are called Huashan, such as the princess in "Visiting Mother", and the maid in "Hongniguan", which represent intelligent and open-minded women. Singing is the same as Qingyi, reciting and acting are close to Huadan, dignified and fluent, combining both. It was created by Wang Yaoqing and continued by Mei Lanfang, and the name Huashan was discovered in the opera world.</p>
<p>Lao Dan is for playing women under 100 years old and over 40 or 50 years old. They must have the appearance of an old woman to be dressed appropriately. For example, Liu Qingti in "Huayoushan" and Xu Mu in "Xu Mu Scolding Cao" are all examples. Only the late Gong Yunfu was good at playing this role. Such as Chen Shi in "Sending Relatives and Performing Rites", Ma Shi in "Tielianhua", Dou Shi in "Puqiushan", as well as Song Mama in "Four Jinshi" and Liu Matchmaker in "Shiyuzhuo", etc., this item is mostly played by Wen Chou concurrently, and in terms of roles, it should still be included in the Dan category.</p>
<p>Wudan emphasizes martial arts skills, somersaults, pole climbing, and the use of props are all essential skills. The appearance does not have to be as beautiful as Daoma, the figure does not have to be as charming as Daoma, but the fighting skills must be proficient and the falls must be stable. There are things that Daoma cannot match, this is why Dan is martial arts. Such as "Huachunyuan", "Sanchakou", "Qingshishan", "Shuiman Jinshan" and other all Wudan plays.</p>

<p>Xiao Li took Jin Shishi into the dance hall. Xiao Li said to him, "You are really a monster. When you enter the dance hall, you don't dance yourself, and you don't allow others to dance!" But Shishi said, "Really, coffee is not stimulating enough!"</p>
<p>Xiao Mei said, "Xiao Chen accompanied me to find a doctor who can perform surgery... I was worried... I saw a man with a college student's air扶持ing a lady out of the doctor's operating room, the lady's face was as pale as a dead person, Xiao Chen ran out as soon as he saw it..." It turned out that the woman was Xiao Chen's fiancée, his lover!</p>
<p>Mother Mi said to Mi Mi, "Hmph, you don't have money, but you have money to open a room... You, you specialize in supporting gigolos, poor college students, hmph! Mi Mi, you have simply forgotten why you are called Mi Mi!"</p>
<p>Mi Mi replied to her: "Because the family has no rice to eat, you forced me to be a dancer! You treat me like rice for you to eat!"</p>
<p>Xiao Li: "Have you looked under the sofa?" Xiao Li: "Look, there's a dead person underneath!"</p>
<p>Xiao Li: "Haven't you seen it in the newspaper? "A person opened a room and went to sleep. In the middle of the night, a beautiful dead body of Miss Kudeng rolled out from under the sofa."</p>
<p>Dingxiang: "Discontinuation"! "Suicide Mi Mi, now committed suicide out of world-weariness, with no relationship to anyone, Mi Mi's last words."</p>
<p>Li: "Haicai, it's over, my first place is over!"</p>

<h3>Chess Garden</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Bao Zipo, Edited by Lu Chengzhun</p>
<p>Game 15: Abstract of the Endgame</p>
<p>Red goes first to draw</p>
<p>How to play will be revealed tomorrow</p>
<p>According to the cannon and double bishops can draw a single chariot, and the horse and double bishops cannot draw, which means that the horse is inferior to the cannon. The chariot cannon and double bishops can draw double chariots, and the chariot horse and double bishops can also draw, which means that the horse is not inferior to the cannon. Although the horse and double bishops cannot draw a single chariot, it is not easy to break it. The chariot horse and double bishops can draw double chariots, but it is very difficult to draw. The reason why the cannon and double bishops and the chariot cannon and double bishops can draw is that they have a certain drawing method, so it is easy. The reason why the horse and double bishops cannot draw a single chariot is that there is no certain drawing method, so it is broken. The chariot horse and double bishops also have no certain drawing method, but the result is a draw, which shows that the theory of chess is extremely mysterious and difficult to understand. Just like this game, from the surface, it seems that the double chariot side can win, but the result is a draw. There are many smart people among the readers. I hope to study it further. If the one holding the double chariots can have a winning method, this garden has a small reward to help with your Yaxing.</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Forbidden City and the Pear Garden in the Former Capital (97)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Lao Tan Asks About Liu Hongsheng's Cause of Death</p>
<p>Besides the three major schools of Wang, Tan, and Sun, there was also the Liu school in the world of old male roles. The founder of the Liu school was the cripple Liu Hongsheng. This man did not pay much attention to pronunciation when singing, and because he had a venereal disease that ruined one of his legs, he was naturally not good at stage movements. When it came to armed combat, it was even more out of the question. Therefore, Liu the Cripple's performances could only be listened to for his voice and tone. As for the plays he knew, there were only a few. Therefore, the people of Tianjin compiled a saying for him, saying, "Three executions, one exploration, and then bumping the stele and running away." This meant that for the first three days of his engagement, he would always perform "Execution of the Son," "Execution of Su," and "Execution of the Yellow Robe." In between, he would perform some less important plays like "Perfect Return to Zhao," "Golden Water Bridge," and "Beating the Golden Branch." At most, he could perform for twenty days without repeating the same play. Then he would have to turn around and reheat leftovers. When the theater posted "Bumping the Stele," he would have to make himself scarce.</p>
<p>Listening to opera is originally supposed to be enjoyable. To meticulously study the sounds and pronunciations is only for about one or two percent of the audience. Therefore, Hongsheng, relying solely on his smooth and natural voice, did indeed cause a sensation for a time. During his peak, even Lao Tan was somewhat afraid of him. In the past, Lao Tan also often performed "Execution of the Son," but the lyrics were different from Liu the Cripple's. Because this play didn't have much in the way of stage movements and was all about using falsetto, fancy tunes, and showcasing vocal skills, it suited Liu Hongsheng's style perfectly. Therefore, he stopped performing this play. Who knew that Liu the Cripple wouldn't be so polite and slowly competed with Lao Tan in singing "The Lost Empty City and the Execution of Ma Su." Fortunately, the Tan school's "Three Explorations" had different expressions, different tones of voice, and different recitations. These few skills were something that no one could learn. Others performing this would either be too dull or too fiery. Lao Tan's kind of expression was truly refined and indescribably wonderful. To discuss the wonders of Tan's "Three Explorations" will require a dedicated article in the future, because it will require at least one or two thousand words to explain thoroughly, so it will not be discussed here for the time being. Although Hongsheng wanted to use this play to compete with Lao Tan, the result was always disappointment.</p>
<p>The "Since That Day" section of the "Hongyang Cave" play, sung in Erhuang Kuaiban, is also Lao Tan's unsurpassed masterpiece. This play emphasizes both singing and acting and is a famous Tan school play that emphasizes flavor rather than showcasing vocal skills. Unexpectedly, Hongsheng overestimated himself and actually took up this play as well. Lao Tan was really a little annoyed. When Hongsheng posted that he would be performing the play, Lao Tan also hid in the crowd to eavesdrop, wanting to see what Liu the Cripple was good at. What kind of magic did he have to attract so many people? Think about it, in the theaters of Beijing, who didn't recognize the old man? Even the seasoned opera fans knew him.</p>
