<p>社評</p>
<h3>傀儡反英運動的透視</h3>
<p>近來日本軍閥嗾使南北傀儡，在日軍佔領區域，從事反英運動。南京·杭州·上海·開封等地的傀儡報紙，無不大事宣傳，街頭巷尾，遍貼反英標語。最近英國駐日大使克萊琪蒞滬，與駐華大使寇爾會商遠東問題，日閥乃又嗾使傀儡，加緊此項運動，竟在滬西散發反英傳單，張貼反英標語，向兩大使示威。日閥所以要發動這種運動，其目的除利用歷史上的中英關係，以激發中國人民的反英情緒，分化中國抗戰實力，以遂其以華制華的陰謀外；還在强姦中國民意，企圖藉此轉移英國對華的觀感，而終止援華運動，以減少她侵華的阻力。</p>
<p>誠然，過去英國對中國，雖也不無痛心的事情，但無論如何，總不像今日日本的橫暴。自「九一八」事變以來，中國領土之被蹂躪的有多少？中國人民之被屠殺的有多少？中國經濟文化事業之被摧毀的又不知多少？這些沒齒難忘的血債，祇有靦顏事仇，認賊作父的漢奸傀儡才會聽而不聞，視而不見。日本軍閥要想掩飾這眼前的事實，而利用歷史上的痛心事件，來激發中國人民的反英情緒，移轉對日目標，以分化抗戰實力，眞何異於緣木求魚？</p>
<p>日本侵略中國，不獨與中國爲敵，而且與世界大多數的國家——尤其是英國——爲敵。日本軍閥的鐵蹄，由東北蹂躪到華北·華中·華南，以至於海南島，不但英國的在華利益，盡被吞噬；即香港，馬來半島與印度也飽受威脅。英國爲保持她的在華利益，解除香港，馬來半島和印度所受的威脅起見，乃在經濟上一再援助中國，增强中國抗戰實力。因爲英國的在華利益己和中國的獨立解放交織在一起，祗有積極帮助中國，使中國早日取得勝利，才能保障她在華的利益。這種援助，自然增加了日本侵華的困難。所以日閥對此，非常恐慌，除統制華北外匯，禁用法幣，封鎖長江珠江，排斥英國在華的商業利益，以武力威脅天津上海租界，以爲報復外，還嗾使傀儡，强姦民意，發動反英運動。</p>
<p>這種陰謀，日本軍閥是慣於使用的。在二三個月以前，寇爾大使往華北巡視，當時日閥正苦於侵華軍事毫無進展，而國內反戰情緒日益濃厚，進退兩難，於是便利用漢奸傀儡，假借華北各團體名義，向寇爾呼籲和平，以冀變更英國對華觀感，出任調停，而得在有利的條件之下結束戰事。可是寇爾抵津之後，華北各民衆團體，即聯合發表宣言，堅決表示，擁護政府，抗戰到底，揭破了日閥的陰謀，使他計不得售。這次陰謀，目的雖與以前不同，但其手段是一貫的。其强姦民意，和假借華北民衆團體名義呼籲和平，如出一轍。可是滬西一帶的反英標語，凡沒有僞警保護的，都被民衆撕去了。而在英國則從前旣未受其騙，現在當然也不會入其彀中。</p>
<p>不但如此，英國的援助中國，是日本軍閥侵略中國，呑噬英國在華利益所促成的。所以除日本軍閥自動放棄侵華政策外，她的援華運動，不但不會終止，反要和他的侵華行動成正比例地加强起來。不但如此，侵略者無止境的侵略，已使英國整個的對外政策有所轉變。張伯倫已一反過去對侵略者因循優容的態度，而負起組織反侵略同盟的責任，在東歐接受約束了。這一個轉變，在日德義分工合作，從事侵略的今日，是非常重要的。她旣痛感過去所採政策之非是，而要在歐洲阻止德義的侵略運動，則同時對遠東的日本，自然也不會放鬆。克萊琪蒞滬與寇爾會商，目的就在設法强調她的遠東政策。所以日本軍閥嗾使傀儡反英，亦徒見其日暮途窮，倒行逆施，心勞日拙罷了。</p>

<h3>江門失陷之前後　戰四晝夜雙方死傷均鉅　西江華軍保持原有各陣地</h3>
<p>香港通信、粤省新會縣屬之江門、爲西江支流之通商巨埠、水陸交通、頗稱便利、商業暢旺、人口繁庶、廣州失陷後、江門之必遭優犯、自意中事、爰將江門失陷之前後情形、分誌如次、</p>
<p>未陷前之江門</p>
<p>九江三水被日軍佔領後、江門與西江之上游交通、已失去聯終、尙幸西江南岸未被日軍蹂躪、故江門之上、可藉江鶴公路。要明公路·之破壊綫而通達肇慶、接駁梧州江門之下、可藉支流以航行石岐·澳門·而轉達香港、港澳日常所需用之菜蔬生菓、大半均仰給於江門之接濟、西江上游需用之舶來貨物、亦由港澳經江門而輸入內地、加以各地避難民衆、又多數集合於此、故江門較諸戰前、倍形熱鬧、同時中山·新會·沿海之日艦隊及漁船、其日常之糧食及一切原料、直接雖仰給於澳門、而間接實取給於中山新會、蓋因私梟充斥、軍隊防範之力、庸有未週、一般私梟、遂由中·新兩縣屬偷運往澳、無形中不啻爲日人之接濟也、</p>
<p>失陷前之情形</p>
<p>三月二十七日日軍由大良攻陷容奇·桂洲、即晚、東西馬寗一帶、發現日騎兵甚多、江門守備司令李務滋·副司令周漢鈴·保安團長池中寬等、即召集各高級軍官開緊急會議商討攻守計劃、一面抽調部隊、加緊佈防、一面急電戰區司令長官張發奎·西江總指揮鄧龍光、報告江門危急情形、請立派大軍應援、翌日、復派警察沿門勸吿商民搬遷貨物、及疏散市內人口、各輪渡盡被封用、裝載民衆逃靴、全市立即宜布戒嚴、自二十八日起、全體商店、均已停業、各避難民衆，或往台山三埠·或往石岐·澳門、携老扶幼、情形至爲狼狽、即晚又據報、鶯哥咀河面、集有日艦艇二十餘艘、準備撲攻江門、九江佛山之日軍、又頻頻移動、華軍益加緊備戰、至二十九日拂曉、日軍遂水陸大舉、三路向北街，江門·進攻、是日江門陷於混亂狀態、外間遂盛傳江門於二十九日下午失守、其實未也、</p>
<p>江門之保衞虞</p>
<p>三月二十九日、日軍三路分犯江門、其艦隊由鶯哥咀順流而下、先佔猪頭山、直撲北街洋關前·及東砲台、猛烈發砲轟擊，陸軍則一由東西馬寗侵犯荷塘潮蓮、一由九江出動、沿鶴山沙坪進犯下棠、又有飛機十二架、整日輪廻飛至北街江門、大施轟炸、戰至下午二時、華軍沿岸陣地砲壘、悉被砲火炸彈所毀、北街旣失、江門極危、鄧龍光適於此時派兵兩團、由鶴山斜趨玉崗、將下棠之日軍包抄擊潰、斬獲二百餘人、同時外海潮蓮之日軍、亦被華軍砲擊、不能渡河、北街正面之日軍、則被堵截於水南、三路日軍、均未得逞、目損失甚巨、至三十日、日軍復從虎門小黃埔一帶、增　海陸大軍的兩聯隊、及飛機二十餘架、分向白石·白沙·荷塘·橫江·三江·一帶搶陸、華軍在日軍海陸空猛烈攻擊之下、戰至三十一日、移轉陣地至水南後崗範羅崗一帶、與日軍對峙、日軍愈迫愈緊、其淺水艦隊、目迫至江門堤西路發砲、兩軍至於巷戰、是晚華軍不得已退出江門、移轉至岡州路一帶高地、直至四月一日上午八時、江門遂完全失守、自廿九日起、至四月一日、共經四晝夜之激戰、雙方傷亡達千餘人、民衆之被流彈傷亡者亦百餘人、各繁盛街市、多被飛機炸燬、頽垣敗瓦、不堪入目、</p>
<p>兩軍相持會城</p>
<p>守工門之華軍、自撤退至會城後、分別在城外象山·龜崗山·一帶高地設置新陣地、其前錢分配於岡州公路兩旁之大澤·禮樂·司前·等處、團隊均紛紛出動抗戰、一日晚、日軍進玫會城未下、二日晨、日軍加派大隊前進、並派飛機向會城·大澤·司前·禮樂·汾水江口一帶大施轟炸、槍砲聲隆隆不絕、新會縣政府及各機關、已於江門失陷前一日、遷往單水口臨時辦事、會城內之十字門中山路一帶舖戶、多被日機炸彈及大砲彈轟毀、城內有四五處火頭燃燒、秩序異常混亂、</p>
<p>石岐加緊戒嚴</p>
<p>中山縣長張惠長、於容桂失守後、由香港回中山縣、開始佈防、廿八日、先將岐關公路毀壊、幷派兵堅守小欖·古鎭·牛屎灣·一帶陣地、禁止船隻車輛來往、但截至三日長、小欖古鎭、尙無日軍騷擾、</p>
<p>新順漢奸活動</p>
<p>此次進犯容桂江門之日軍除陸海空軍外、尙有廣州僞南海縣長李道軒·僞維持會委員梁永桑等、所組織之僞自衛軍及僞工農軍、由李梁二人分任指揮及嚮導、故能從小路迂廻、或從港汉支流、以小汽船掩護帆布艇進襲、惟因港汶紛歧、防地遼闊、華軍防守異常單薄、未能處處防範、致被日軍抄襲、李梁諸傀儡、已於一日到達江門、召集該處土劣陳某趙某、商量組織僞縣政府、其僞縣長一職、聞將以陳口揚充任、</p>
<p>西江上游動態</p>
<p>當廣州·佛山·九江·各處日軍出動進攻江門時、三水河口之日軍、又佯作攻勢、企圖牽制西江之華軍、日砲兵曾於廿九·三十·兩日、在西馬口發砲向金利華軍轟擊、舊三水之日軍、又向蘆包馬房、頻頻隔河發砲、並派飛機數架、整日飛至廣利·後瀝·肇慶·白土高明·各地偵察、華軍於嚴密防範之外、並派桂軍某部、從高鶴方面開入新會救援、外間謂有桂軍開到江門助戰者、殆即此也</p>
<h3>無錫偽知事　赴鄕遇險　城內又起紛擾</h3>
<p>無錫通訊、偽知事秦亮工、遵日方特務班意旨、前赴各鄉、所謂撫慰鄕民、藉以减少反抗情緒、秦明知各鄉游擊隊密佈、無法推諉、前日與僞民政科長顧翰屛、日隊長坂本、日特務班長二寸穰、與日軍一小隊、前往梅村·秦伯·南延·蕩口各鄕鎭、蕩口駐有日軍、僞鄕董華子唯、在鹽棧設招待處、秦與日隊長等均住華宅一宵、詎在此嚴密保護中、秦返城時、在某處突被壯士八人、各出手搶向秦亂擊、因目標不準、未遂壯志、秦僅飽受虛驚而已、</p>
<p>無錫西門德心橋日汽油庫、忽於前日失火、損失頗鉅、同時城內八兒巷附近、僞探陳士元被擊受傷、日僞因此將城門緊閉、各處斷絕交通、挨戶由日憲兵與偽警搜查、但毫無所獲、城內居民、如籠中之鳥、聰其擺佈、稍有餘資者、又紛紛避滬、城門共閉三天、方准開放、</p>

<h3>日軍企圖侵犯潮汕　截捕船隻以資利用</h3>
<p>汕頭通信、潮浪警備司令華振中就職後、積極　員民衆、疏散老弱婦孺、加緊鞏固沿岸防務工事、汕頭各團隊、自三月三十日起、一連六十天、到郊外演戰、實彈射擊、幷於是日起、嚴禁一切漁船帆船駛出馬嶼口外、南澳與潮汕之交通、目下完全斷絕、查潦海南北港與南澳之間、泊有日艦兩艘、該日艦每日派出武裝汽艇、追捕海外漁艇貨船、澄海南北港·汕頭馬嶼·潮陽達濠·被捕去帆船漁船的一百艘以上有被縱火焚去、有被擊斃船夫、有因躍水逃生被溺斃者、被捕之漁船、排列於南澳大山下、又日艦搜集船隻、對潮汕沿岸、似有所企圖、南澳縣因華方朱設防、上月日軍登岸五决、每决上陸、人民必驚逃入山、有警察所長陳某、保長章某、因逃鋅不及、致被擊斃、最近南澳父淪於日軍掌中、前天、潮陽縣屬之達濠、忽起虛驚、因有日快艇一艘、載武裝日兵十餘名、疾駛至河渡頭上岸、日兵在海邊偵察、測繪地圖形、頃刻即駛去、由此可見日軍最近確有試探潮汕之企圖也、</p>

<h3>黃河之花園口趙口潰決與　商榷蘇北防禦水災辦法</h3>
<p>— （東臺費祝鈞）（續本月六日本報）</p>
<p>是黃河寬窄不一，賈魯河地址常移動，鄭縣開封之間，河流時通時塞，堤岸時毀時成，本屬司空見慣，不足爲奇。中央倘能注意堵口，即在花園口趙口漫流會合點杏花營白沙鎭一帶揀擇較高地點建堤，雖距北岸數十里，寬大河身，未嘗不可，又或堵塞去年八月間所盤做之裹頭工程，一面將盤做之堤身培高加厚，以作河之溝凟，亦未始不能，此皆掙扎堵口之方法也。</p>
<p>五·不堵決口辦理其他工程</p>
<p>決口不堵，而欲防禦蘇北下河水災，鄙意有「急辦」「緩辦」之工程，「急辦工程」有四：</p>
<p>（甲）擴大新中山河擴大之法，依照舊堤，測量南北地勢，擇一方面之工程較略者，加倍寬度，另造新堤，或全行開挖河身，或依—顯氏計劃之逆跌法，每距離十里，挖一跌塘，長的十丈，寬的七十丈，深約二丈三丈不等，附近楊莊河身較之海口河身，寬以倍數，以使水流奔騰衝激，自行擴大可也。</p>
<p>（乙）恢復舊有引河查洪湖達淮陰舊有引河有八：曰張福河，曰裴家塲，曰張家莊，曰爛泥淺，曰三岔河，曰天然，曰天賜，曰太平，現時除張福河通行外，率皆淤塞，爲排洩巨量水流計，所以必須分別挖挑各引河也。</p>
<p>（丙）堵塞三河蔣壩現時洪湖水勢十之八九由蔣壩入高寳湖，十之一二由張福河入新中山河，洪湖水漲，蔣壩入高寳湖宣洩入江不及東面運堤如不及早啟放，勢必靴免崩潰，下河各縣即受沉沒之災，此有識者所共知也。防備之道，所以必須堵塞蔣壩，以使浩瀚之水涓滴皆由北面各引河宜洩。</p>
<p>考歷代湖水類皆北向，自黃水經過淮陰，河身墊高，淮水不易排洩。康熙元年盱泗之民，由古溝鎭南北及谷家橋盜決小渠者八，水始大半分於高買諸湖。靳文襄亦因此故，乃於湖之東南，建立五壩以洩水，實屬權宜之計，因之　　北徙，前賢屢議堵塞蔣壩。今以湍悍黃流，會合洪湖，如無相當尾閭，允易崩潰成災，以淺狹之運河不能順軌出江，以一綫之東堤，烏可敵下衝之勢，此防備目前災息，雖費萬分之力，必當堵塞蔣壩。</p>
<p>（丁）加高高堰等堤　蔣壩不堵，運提各壩，易於啟放，下河各縣即易於成災，蔣壩欲堵，洪湖水勝，宣洩不及，即有滿溢潰決之虞，此洪堤加高鞏固，亦屬防災之必要工程也。</p>
<p>綜計急辦工程，允當决第施行，蓋爲水求奔放計，先擴大新中山河，然後可以開引河，爲水思浩瀚計，先開闢引河，然後始能堵蔣壩，爲水免崩潰計，先堵塞蔣壩，然後方欲加洪堤，是屬蟬聯眉急之工程，不可稍緩者也。</p>
<p>至於緩辦工程亦有四點：</p>
<p>（甲）開挖六安毫猪嶺查淮河原有七十二山河之水，如益以浩瀚黃流，經河南朱仙鎭周家口至安徽正陽關會合以行，北去鳳台，先遭硤石束之，繼受黑山石扼之，復束至懐遠，又扼於荊塗等山。民國二十一年六月國府救濟水災委員會於鳳台懐遠靈璧鳳陽五河盱眙等縣成立，延長叫百公里之淮堤，則正陽關一帶，旣束下游水勢就範，必感上游驟漲難宣，不獨是豫皖壅遏之災，並且爲蘇北久長之害。欲圖救濟之方，惟有分疏之道。查六安之毫猪嶺爲江淮之分水嶺，西北通淮，東南入江，如能擇山凹之處，開鑿通過，此正陽關由渒水分疏入江之道也。</p>
<p>（乙）聯接壽縣合肥水道查壽縣之瓦埠湖南邊支流，與合肥之肥河派河隔離山路，亦不甚遠，如能開挖聯接，亦屬分疏入江與開挖毫猪嶺皆爲减輕來源之法也。</p>
<p>（丙）聯接肝眙六合水道水滿則溢，情理之常，諸水會聚洪灘周圍七百餘里，恃一海口，疏洩甚屬爲難。昔淸之河帥張鵬翮擬於盱眙溜淮套等處，鑿山開道，由六合引淮入江，此時如能依照計劃以行，此爲緩銷洪湖漲勢之良方。</p>
<p>（丁）恢復泗陽三義口水道　查明嘉靖時，泗陽三義口淤塞，此時如能挑挖，恢復原有河身，俾湖水入運，分由六塘灌河以入海，此亦緩銷洪水漲勢之意也。</p>
<p>以上緩辦工程，為减輕來源，及多開去路之方法，備須斟酌地方情形，或先後辦理，或參半舉行，或暫時停頓，相機而動，待時以行，無不咸宜焉。</p>
<p>六、結論</p>
<p>余述在園口趙口堵塞與吾之辦法，與蘇北下河各縣之利害，不禁有我窮之感焉。蓋天下事無兩全之利，揚湯止沸之謀，終不若𨥏底抽薪之術，下河各縣，欲免黃災，自以堵塞決口鈎心鬥角，百端籌措，強求果必非簡單工程，可以了事，必比堵塞黃口，更覺為難，此愚者一得之言，尙乞明達之士指正之。</p>

<p>兩大使長時間談話</p>
<p>克萊琪氏由日抵滬後、除接見英國耆紳商界領袖、並出席寇爾爵士之歡宴外、其他外交酬酢、均婉謝未赴、所有大部份之時間、則均爲與寇爾駐華大使作長時間之談話、昨日下午、克氏復在惇信路寇氏官邸與寇爾爵士·英總領事費利溥·等、繼續商談、外交界方面、認爲此項談話、性質相當重要、於英國對遠東之外交政策、顯有關繫、並相信連日密談之後、當已有圓滿之結果、</p>
<p>寇爾爵士今日赴港</p>
<p>英國駐華大使寇爾爵士、茲定今日乘英艦離滬赴港、轉道重慶、向國府外交當局將有重要接洽、此行約有多日盤桓、故何時始能返滬、現尙難以預知、英總領事曁英商總會等、昨晚均爲寇氏餞行、至駐日大使克萊琪氏、原定即日返任、茲因現須俟唔法國駐華大使戈斯默氏、交換外交意見、故將留滬日期延長、再緩一二日、離滬東渡、</p>
<p>戈斯默氏今日抵滬</p>
<p>法國駐華大使戈斯默氏、前在重慶呈遞國害、並與蔣委員長會晤後、原定上星期由香港乘輪來滬、嗣因撞輪事件受阻、延至六日、始改乘法砲艦「達宇爾」北來、預計行程、將於今日午後二時許、可抵吳淞口、屆時將在太古碼頭登陸法駐滬防軍及捕房方面、決在碼頭戒備保護、並排列武裝隊伍、表示歡迎本埠法商領袖、正籌備盛大歡迎、並爲法大使洗塵、</p>
<h3>天氣晴朗到貨增加　米價漸見回降　日商搜運米麥出口　總額約達一百萬包</h3>
<p>日商三井·三菱·吉田·等三洋行、近又分赴內地各產區、搜運米麥等、偷稅裝運華北華南各口岸販運、其總額預定百萬包、即將足數、滬市米糧來源、因天氣晴朗、到貨增加、米價已漸回平、茲經現代社記者、探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>日商搜運產地米麥</p>
<p>自本埠日本三井三菱吉田等　三洋行、在我沿江各縣農產區域、搜運米麥出口、經各方嚴密注視後、一般仰日人鼻息之奸商、因有所顧忌不敢明目張膽、公然交易、故出口數目、因此减少、茲據現代社記者探悉、該三井等洋行、近與少數不肖米業掮客、組織×記洋行、假借×商名義、向上海及內地產區、訂購大量米麥、裝運虹口後、再裝日輪偷稅轉運大連·天津·烟台·廈門·廣東·等各日商埠售賣·南帮若干米行、受惑而與該洋行交易者頗多、現豆米行業同業公會方面、正在進行調查中、一經查實、即予懲處、</p>
<p>總額百萬卽將足數</p>
<p>日商三井·三菱·吉田·等三洋行、在華搜運糧食、其總額預定米六十萬包、麥四十萬包、自積極牧購以來、除小麥全數運出外、米糧一項、陸續裝運出口者、的達四十餘萬包、尙缺十餘萬包、刻仍繼續搜購、不久亦可裝出、</p>
<p>滬市米糧來源增加</p>

<h3>徹底</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>凡物只有正反兩性，沒有中性；凡事只有是非兩端，沒有中端。所有的中性或中端，不過是暫時的現象，不是因中和而消滅，如電，便混合而成另一事，仍與別事對抗着，如一切政治的組織。這就是事物的徹底性，本來是存在於自然界和人事間的。誰人或誰物，準此而行，就合乎自然，毫無困難，而得有所成就；吾則糾紛迭起，困難重重，其不如陰陽電之相激而成爲轟雷者，幾希！</p>
<p>以言國際大事，最初張伯倫一再低頸，向法西斯國尋求妥洽，結果法西斯國的氣燄愈盛，民治國的聲勢愈弱，一般弱小之犧牲者愈多，而妥洽終歸無效。現在，張伯倫省悟了，大聲作獅子吼，法西斯國才有掩旗息鼓的趨勢。這就是徹底的效騐；徹底不妥洽是合乎自然的原則的。</p>
<p>可惜現在的波蘭，還是不徹底；旣然畏懼着德國，却又一則怕與蘇聯接近以引起德國的嫉視，再則怕與羅馬尼亞訂的以破裂對匈牙利的友誼，只在左右爲難之下，和英國簽訂了單方面的協定。這種不徹底，我可以說，將來一定要發生意外的糾紛，使她吃到苦頭。</p>
<p>以言我國對日交涉，最初何嘗不委曲求全，一再讓步，希望有一些和平，可以安居樂業。可是對方却就得寸進尺，步步壓迫，一定要弄得我們作了亡國奴爲止。這是不徹底抵抗的害處。七七以來，我們舉起了抗戰的大旗，合全國的力最，與敵國週旋，一直到現在，挽在瀾於旣倒，我們的國運，到底得以穩定了。這就是徹底抵抗的好處。</p>
<p>可惜現在竟有一般淺視或別有心肝之徒，還在妄倡和平，不曉得現在的局勢，除了投降或勝利以外，已沒有別的和平可言。這也是他們的不徹底。不過徹底投降，當然說不到：徹底勝利，在國土之上，消滅敵人的踪跡，才是我們現在惟一的目的。因此，我們對於這些妄倡邪說者，就常徹底除去，免得妨害了我們的徹底抗戰，徹底勝利。</p>
<p>此外，社會上，甚至一家一身之事，也未書不可以作如是觀：徹底了就凡事順流而下，迎刃而解；不徹底便遍地荊棘，寸步難行。</p>
<p>不過我所說的徹底，總是積極的，建設的，即使有時不免於消極或破壊，其目的還是在積極與建設。這一點，我希望不會有什麼難解或誤會。</p>
<h3>小胖子</h3>
<p>— 錢昌年</p>
<p>這學期開課的那一天起，課室的右角上便少了那一張圓圓胖胖，大家都慣熟了的臉。</p>
<p>「澄志，你可知道小胖子爲甚麽今年不來了？」</p>
<p>「我也不大知道。但是陸汝鈞吿訴我說，他前天下午走到小胖子家裹，祇見小胖子的爹在歎氣，娘在啼哭，可是始終沒看見小胖子的影兒……」</p>
<p>一連好幾天，同學們都把小胖子失踪的消息當做談話的資料。</p>
<p>他姓章名耀華，「小胖子」不過是他那一百七十多磅的體重獲得來的雅號。他很少說話，可是却不像道學先生那般裝出來的嚴肅，無論誰喊他一聲「小胖子」，他總是裂閒嘴嘻笑，從不曾發過一次脾氣。但這並不是懦弱；他天生就好打不平。以家境來說，他儘有多餘的錢到影戲院看春色無邊那一類的電影，可是他寗願化一塊錢買一本人生哲學，靑年修養講座，時事解剖一類的書，戲院的門沒有踏進一步。他也儘有錢做多少洋裝穿着，然而，一年四季他的身上老是掛着那一件褪了顏色的破藍布袍子。</p>
<p>在許多同學中，他和我最知己。從外貌看來，他是那樣獃頭笨腦的模樣，可是有一决和他對話中，他提起什麽一元論，循環律，唯心，唯物論……連我也聽不明白。我承認：我當時眞的慚愧到了極點，祇有唯唯吾吾的答應，後來，他立起來拍拍我的肩膀說：</p>
<p>「甫！你還得多讀些書。哈！哈！不要見怪！你以前讀的還不够哩！」</p>
<p>他時常對我提述他生平的志向就是：從軍。以他那雄健的體格，沈着的個性，飽滿的學識，我相信一定是祖國的一位標準軍人哩。</p>
<p>燎原的烽火從北方蔓延到華南，上海戰事進行的當兒，他也在後方担仟救護和運輸的工作。戰事西移，他才脫下戎衣回到學校裏來。</p>
<p>從這時起，他臉上的笑容便消失了。他的內心被一種矛盾的紛爭煎熬着：他要到內地投軍，然而他的父母却阻止他，因為他夫婦倆祇有他們一個兒子。</p>
<p>漸漸的，他因爲憂思過度而病倒了。經過兩個月的住院才吿復痊。可是他臉上巳經瘦得委實不成樣子。我安慰他道</p>
<p>「耀華！你瘦得眞可怕。你安心讀書吧！不要多思想了……」</p>
<p>「他們（指同學們）不是還喚我做『胖子』嗎？」他頑皮地對我一笑。我看出：這是勉强扮出來的苦笑。</p>
<p>上學期寒假開始的時候，我因事回到香港家中一行，返滬時又因船遇風延誤了幾天，抵達時學校已經上課了。不料這短短一個月的分別，竟會失掉了道位最可愛的友人！</p>
<p>「他到那兒去了？」</p>
<p>我知道，他正在前錢握着槍桿爲正義而奔波着！</p>
<p>不久，同學們關於「小胖子」的談話已經由冷淡而寂然。祇有我的心頭却永遠壓着一塊鉛石。</p>
<h3>抽心的運用</h3>
<h3>抗糧</h3>
<p>— 階陽</p>
<p>整個的鎭籠罩在陰沉沉的大空中。砭骨的寒風，巡哨着長廊般的市街，格外顯現得悽凉蕭條。</p>
<p>市河中激盪起不平凡的波動，東港西港，成羣的船兒，載來了近百個年靑的一羣。從那頂闊邊氈帽上，可以知道他們盡是以「吃鬥」聞名的澄湖邊的好漢。</p>
<p>一個精壯的靑年，首先跳上了岸，擊起了他手中的鐵鋤，向站在船上的一羣高聲喊道：「傢伙隨手帶好！今天該顯顯我們吃鬥不吃鬥，知道嗎？」他隨手一揚，船上的一羣，都一湧而上了岸。</p>
<p>他們握着鋤頭，扁担，鐵尺……像潮水那樣直往鎭的西梢，湧到了「區公所」的門前，那個精壯的靑年擎起那塊掛在門首的「田賦征收處」的木牌，猛地向那僩站在門邊的僞警擊去：」賊你娘，今天來跟你們完糧！」</p>
<p>他們直向裏衝，穿上了樓。只有一個號稱惡訟師的錢會計在那裏，他們也不打話，一窠蜂地拳打脚踢他一陣，又把他打窗口裏擲下了樓去。</p>
<p>雜沓的搗毀聲中，揚起一陣嚷聲：「到『獨眼主任』家裏去！去…到…去…」</p>
<p>他們像潮水般又到湧了轉角那家染坊裏，那裏是「分會長」兼「征務主任的馬獨眼的家。</p>
<p>可是他們找徧了屋子，不見獨眼龍那厮。</p>
<p>「好，漢奸的傢具，我們也該把它燒燬了才爽快！」那個精壯的靑年，提着兩把椅子，一搬，大家搬！搬到廟塲那邊去燒！」</p>
<p>近百個人一齊動手，一下子把屋裏的東西搬得精空，廟塲上堆成山樣的什麽都有—桌子也有，凳子也有，衣服也有，連那染缸裏浸着的布匹也都撈了起來堆在這裏面。</p>
<p>民衆們把廟塲擠得水洩不通。他們鼓掌歡呼，當那熊熊的烈焰怒吼着的時候。</p>
<p>死去也似的鎭上，也就充溢了熱烘烘的活氣。</p>
<h3>劉二殺賊（抗戰大鼓）</h3>
<p>— 敬昔</p>
<p>長白山頭積雪深，黑龍江畔流水淸。傍山依水有個農人名劉二，年年種麥動耕耘，冬種夏熟一年四季樂，日出而作日入停。恨只恨××海賊無端來侵犯，兵到之處都變了荒村。女被强姦男被害，這個劉二被海賊拉去扛軍火，日夜鞭打就像牛馬不像一個人。一天隨軍出發到了宿遷城門外，鬼子列陣就紮營。</p>
<p>我軍飛機空中響，砲聲震耳如雷鳴；忠勇將士一聲喊，賊兵紛紛鳥獸奔。劉二眼看賊兵散，愛國的心腸油然生：說時遲來那時快，手奪倭槍就打賊兵，四週賊兵多如海，劉二那裏放在心。遠的放槍近的刺，連殺賊兵無數名；一面殺來一面喊：「建功殺賊在如今！」聲聲喊呌飄四野，被迫的伙夫齊淚零，頓時奮起賊營內，殺聲遍地震山林。一而我軍向前進，一面伙夫在後而動刀兵，賊兵腹背都被困，砲火之下了殘生。錦繡河山依舊歸中國，我軍慶祝盡歡欣。這就是劉二殺賊一件事，願同胞愛國愛家子子孫孫抗寇兵。</p>
<h3>文化商人與文化人</h3>
<p>— 赤槐</p>
<p>這是一個資本主義的社會，這社會的特徵，就是一切物的商品化，文化人的姿態，那怕文化人自己的意志是怎樣，依舊逃不過以商品化的姿態出現。現在從事文化的人雖然是一種苦難，却是歷史的定命的事實，非僩人的力量所能擺脫。</p>
<p>可是照資本主義的「公平」交易的原則言，一個商品的賣方與買方，是各自站在「平等」的地位的，各自服着所謂「自由意志進行交易，賣貨的可以討價，買貨的可以還價，那怕這是偽自由的形式。</p>
<p>但獨有文化人和文化商人間的「賣買」是例外，除少數有名文人的作品有定價外（而且這與其說是賣方自定，母寗說是買方鑒於賣方的聲名而定的），很少見一個文人將其產品標價出售。這原因因爲文人只注意其作品，而不大注意其作品所應得的代價。他不能像別的商品般估計其產品的「生產費用」——成本。他把稿子交給出版者或其他發行人而由買方偏面算定所謂一千字多少錢的稿費。對於一個文人，斤斤於多少錢是認爲一種羞恥的，這種觀念，已經成爲歷來已久的一般文人心理。</p>
<p>文化人的工作目的，主要在推進社會的向上，所以不以金錢爲目標。就文化人的優點言，他除了獲得一部分爲生活所必需的金錢外，他更獲得一定程度的社會地位。可是在現社會的情形下，這一定程度的地位，却往往犧牲了他們的最低限度的必需生活，我們因此看到了一般文人的蒼白而瘦削的臉，一副窮書生的寒酸相。關於一般文人的悲慘生活，巳有許多死於窮困的文人佐證，這里不想多說。</p>
<p>若果一般文人的悲慘生活，其代個確是全部供獻於社會的進步，那麽我敢代表每一個文人說，他們是甘心的。但事實却吿訴我們不然。從事文化的人像別的許多勞動者一樣，受着一小羣人的剝削和榨取，這羣人就是文化商人。他們利用文人羞於論爭金錢酬報的弱點，以超乎榨取尋常勞動者的手段，榨取文化勞動者。這在抗戰以前是事實，而在抗戰中的今日，尤其是鐵一樣的事實。</p>
<p>讀者諸君也許有不少人羨慕文人的生活，但諸君心目中想像的只是少許特異地位文人的生活，或美國式野人頭傳說中的文人生活。至於一般文人的生活現狀，只有過着道樣實際生活的人們，才能領略箇中味道。箇中雖決非桃花源，但却一樣的不能爲外人道。</p>
<p>我們且不談今日文化人勞作的報酬，這是無從談起的。我們只要問他們的工作有沒有報酬。是的，我不敢說全沒有報酬。但文人要取得他工作應得報酬之前，却先須學得市儈式的面目。有這種本領的文人，不能說全然沒有，但却絕對少數。</p>
<p>於是乎寄生於文化人勞動的文化商人，始終得以在妓院裹，在跳舞廳裹過其荒淫的生活，反正有許多文化機關在大量產生文化工作者的失業後備軍，他們正不必怕文人會死完。</p>
<p>我們爲避免漢奸和托派的挑撥，所以不願具體指出今日文化商人怎樣剝削文人的事業。我們遵守國家勞資合作的法令，不願造成敵人離間口實的糾紛。我們更不想在此整個國家在艱難時期中要求提高文化人的生活標準—雖然我們擁護改善一般人民生活的水準，但我們要求有最低限度的生活。我們認爲文化工作是協助抗戰勝利的一枝有力的隊伍。我們不能聽憑文化商人無限制的剝削—不付稿費，吞沒版稅，偷印原作者遠在內地的作品等等。這是等於盜匪的行爲！至少應予以道德的制裁。</p>

<h3>撲滅火災</h3>
<p>— 戈兒</p>
<p>如果「火」是危險的東西，那末，消滅危險的「火」，務使其不發生「火災」，這是很正確的學動，而同時也是大助於世界人類的安全的一件善舉。</p>
<p>可是，「玩火者」是不以爲然的。他認爲「火」之所以會發生「危險」者，因爲世界上原來是有「燃火物」這東西存在的緣故。</p>
<p>所以「玩火者」認爲用「火」燒去「燃火物」，正是消滅「火災」的唯一的方法。因爲在他的意識中，認爲世界上要是沒有「燃火物」這東西，豈不是「火」自然而然會消滅的麽？</p>
<p>這種「玩火者」的所謂「理論」，令人聽了發生「異感」，原是很必然的。「玩火者」的所以要發出那樣似是而非的怪誕之言，唯一的原因，是要掩飾他的「玩火」的把戲而已。</p>
<p>比如說：希特拉去年併了奧地利，吞了蘇台德區，那時舉世惶惶，於是希特拉這位「玩火者」的聖手，就對英國及全世界發出聲明：他對世界已無領士的要求了！然而「火」究竟是「火」，如果不去撲滅牠，而因恐懼牠而反去躱避牠，那是不行的。因此，捷克又被吞滅了，雖然希特拉也曾經對英國及全世界聲明過：德國不願支配其他民族。「那末捷克不是日耳曼族呀！」然而捷克是「燃火物」啊！</p>
<p>不信，請看他對滅亡捷克怎樣說法？他說：「苟捷克不壓迫德人而爲共產主義之工具，則吾人對於獨立的捷克國，決不有何舉動。」這是希特拉對「防共協定」的履行的一片忠誠，誰都不能說他不是的。雖然有被「防」的「共」產外交部長李維諾夫拆穿這一句話的西洋鏡說：「防共協定是地質學上的名詞。」然而世界上最講眞實話的莫過於希特拉與墨索里尼了，還有，在遠東宣揚正道的日本，之外，不是「共產主義的工具」，就是「共產主義的自身」了，他們的話難道可以置信的麽？所以希特拉的滅亡捷克，是很正當的，是因爲「余以爲余對於和平大有貢獻，以余已消滅中歐「大危險故也。」這樣，人們還嗎該呼着上帝來感謝我們的一和平之神希特拉」了！</p>
<p>然而「玩火者」的似是而非的話，雖然曾經欺騙過一些愚蠢的人們過，可是「火」一燒到人們的跟前，要不是木石，誰都要跳起來設法撲滅它的。「火」究霓是危險的東西。過去曾經受過「玩火者」的欺騙，那末及今覺悟，還是來得及。爲了世界不再遭受可怕的「火災」，我希望世界上再也沒有一個人去相信「玩火者」的一言一語了吧！</p>
<p>大家起來撲滅「火災」！</p>
<h3>「小東西」觀感</h3>
<p>— 李之華</p>
<p>世紀福期出品　大光明戲院開映</p>
<p>從表面上來看，「小東西」還是秀　鄧波兒的一個跳跳蹦蹦的戲，不過無可否認的，這個戲和過去她所主演的幾張小什麽的歌唱舞蹈片却有其不同的地方。</p>
<p>我們從故事上也可以看出來：</p>
<p>「建築師傑夫，夙有抱負，擬於貧民區內建築大樓，以利貧民居住，適逢社會不景氣，金融呆滯，致工程無法進行，傑夫因是而失業破產。傑夫早年結婚，妻已故去，膝前一女名潘妮，見乃父終日鬱鬱不歡，閑處家門，又因每與鄰居幼童嬉戲，輒遭公寓經理華特士斥責，乃大惑不解，向傑夫詢問其故，傑夫謂皆因「山姆叔叔」（美國的別名）身處厄境，致一切皆受阻礙，潘妮聞言，遂蓄意協助此「山姆叔叔」解決困難，俾傑夫能順利進行其計劃。」</p>
<p>從上面所引的說明書我們可以看得出來，「小東西」較之以往的單是以戀愛爲挿曲，以秀蘭的歌舞爲骨幹的戲，是有其不同之處的，雖然在導演慣了秀蘭的小什麼的戲的歐文克敏斯，他還是把這個很好的戲，和過去的戲同樣的處理着，以致辱沒了這個劇本的優點，但劇本的優點還是有若干點可以看得出來，如兩種孩子娛樂的不同，以及他們之間的界限</p>
<p>固然，劇作者祇是一個改良主義者，他樂觀地以潘妮的演　籌款叻「山姆叔叔」來感動有「山姆叔叔」之稱的銀行家漢簫因是慨然「乃向記者宣佈　將傾全力贊助傑夫建屋之計劃，」於是給以圓滿答覆，好像貧民居住問題眞個是從此解決了。</p>
<p>這個答覆固然還是一個空心湯糰，可是作者巧妙地把銀行家漢蕭這個「山姆叔叔」和美國的「山姆叔叔」這兩個別號連系起來，「演劇籌備以助之」，這在此時此地開映，使得鼓勵兒童對國家的熱愛，這無論如何是不無好處的。「小東西」的評價應在其他小什麽之類的片子以上，其關鍵也止該在這上面。</p>
<p>在銀幕上出現的「山姆叔叔」銀行家漢蕭，他的化裝是和我們在漫畫上所看到的代表美國的山姆叔叔相類似的，這固然是爲了劇情的需要，但也正是作者的苦心所在。</p>
<p>至於其他在演出方面的，則和過去的秀蘭幾張戲並無多大的不同，歐文克斯敏還是他所用慣的那一套老手法。即以劇本的編製上，也大都相同，如作爲調劑和增强空氣的丑角的穿挿，本劇內也有瓊黛維絲等，飾公寓經理的富蘭克林潘龐雖然作者很想寫他的謟富欺貧的勢利腔，但他的面目則也還是一個丑角。</p>
<p>秀蘭鄧波兒還是依舊保持她過去的那股幼年老成腔調，所謂「電影皇帝』却爾福雷，此公比珍妮蓋諾更慘，逐漸已爲我們淡忘下去了，這裏他祗是平穩而已。</p>

<h3>圖書館</h3>
<p>— 張鎭山</p>
<p>是知識食糧的倉庫　對新亞底幾點要求</p>
<p>在力求敎育普及掃除文盲的現在，圖書館也有一個相當重大的使命；牠非但在推進敎育的方式上能作種種有效能的貢獻，並且，在社會進化的過程中還能導示着一般社會的前進動向，尤其是在求取學識和生活經騐的靑年羣中抗戰時期的文化部門中，牠更是不可忽略的一種發揚文化，灌漑民族意識的良好工具；所以，各文化團體，祇要組織健全，範圍廣泛的，對於圖藝館總是絕對重視，至少也有一個「圖書室」的組設。</p>
<p>在上海，各文化機關組設的圖書館，數量似乎很多，超過了國內任保一個都市，但若以人口的比例看起來，上海的圖書館數量實在是不够的，和內地比較還在水準之下，何况還有一般是有限制的閱覽。</p>
<p>上海的圖書館大槪可分為有限制及公開二種。前者以各大學附設的為多，例如：滬江大學圖書館（圓明園路一六九號）；聖約翰，東吳，之江，復旦四大聯合圖書館，（南京路慈淑大樓）；東吳法學院圖書館（跑馬廳附近幕爾堂）；震旦大學圖書館（呂班路該校二樓）；海關圖書館（新閘路一七〇八號）；後者公開的，有；新亞圖書館（南京路慈淑大樓）；靑年會圖書館（八仙橋）；明復圖書館（亞爾培路五三三號）；工部局公共圖書館（北京路）；中國流　圖書館（福州路）等幾家。</p>
<p>那些有限制閱覽的圖書館，內部設備雖佳，專門學科的書籍亦多，但僅限於各該機關的敎職員，學生，及有相當關係的人物，才有閱覽資格，外人是無從問津，姑勿詳述。而公開閱覽的當中也有種種手被問題麻煩的，例如：明復須有團體的書面介紹；靑年會須納費；流通地位小：工部局又係側重於西書。在「孤島」上眞公開的中國書籍最多的圖書館，似乎只有新亞，（即前申報後改量才戰後改丁香現改新亞）。牠因地處公共租界的心臟區，有交通上的便利條件，內部的設備也很完善；圖書方面，關於科學，工藝，政治，軍事，經濟，敎育，建設，財政，交通，天文，地理，哲學，生理，醫藥，以及名人小說創作等等，應有盡有。報紙方面，除上海當日的各大報外，尙有：重慶的中央日報，新華日報，廣西的南寗新聞報，福建日報，浙甄日報等數種·，對於溝通「孤島」和內地的消息，眞具有莫大的助力與功效，使讀者可以得知內地各處局部動態的輪廓。所以該備的閱覽室，終日坐無隙地；惜其對於本市報紙數量的配備太固執，似乎一律四份，以致著名的大報就供不敷求，你搶我奪，捷足先得，而有幾種報紙則又終日安靜地躺在架上，無人問津，關於這，希望該館在可能範圍內，來一下配合需要的適當調劑才好。</p>
<p>至於雜誌方面，種類雖豐富，取閱雖可隨意，但因讀者過多，後至者均有向隅之憾。惟書籍就不虞讀者擁擠，可隨心所欲，終日坐於閱覽室內，硏究，抄錄，可不受限制，且不贊一文，即掉換的次數多，亦不至受到厭惡的輕視。</p>
<p>最近，該館又舉辦「知識講座」，讀者祇須寫明姓名，略歷，地址等，即可領取聽講券（不取分文）；這眞是一般無力求學而感知識飢荒的貧窮靑年們樂聽的一個好消息。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第七回　乳燕新鶯影聯雙璧　越羅吳錦機織七襄</p>
<p>何家兩位小姐在她父親北行的時候，不是曾說過：暫時不回廣東，而上海又太緊囂想在離上海略近，擇個地方，建築一座小別墅嗎？又說：在訪問同學朱愛人的當兒，隨時留意。現在又有信來，提及創辦織綢廠的事，而那個織綢廠，又最好設立在江浙兩省之間。此刻朱愛人又要求她們設廠就在此地不是安樂鎭　是自由村。雖然是一句戲言，但在這裏設廠，也並非不可能。儷玉與雙玉，這幾天常在安樂鎭的近邊散步，見桑田桑　很不少，知道這裏本來是養蠶區域。又聽得朱愛人講：自由村也是如此。不過自由村是個新村，一切正在草創時代。倘然我們的廠設立到自由村去，不知有何不便？若是眞固在那裏建立起來，一個新村上。平添了一個工廠，當然要立刻繁榮不少咧。她們兩人心中雖如　想，口內不言，因爲本來建築別墅的心思，此刻擴展到創辦工廠了。不過父親的信，却就要答復他，大意是：「創辦織綢廠的事，原則上是贊同。本來我們所學的是什麽呢？原是想回國以後，振興吾國的紡織工業，使之行銷於全世界。現在旣有這個機會，督促成就這一個廠，那是公私交益的事，我們必須努力爲之。資本旣然現成，第一步，我們就要想地了。江浙兩省，向來是養蠶的地方，又是向來出絲織品的地方，織綢廠的設立在江浙兩省之間，當然是不祧之論。不過也要看那地方的水陸交通，運輸利便，尤其是那工人薈萃之區。現在我們一面找尋地方，一面把計畫書先起草起來，呈請父親核定。」這樣的覆了她父親一封快信，一面兩人就要起草計畫書了。依了何儷玉的意思，「覺得我們好好兒辦理一個織物廠，一百萬元恐伯是不够的。第一項，房屋機器，我們都是要最新型的。因爲我們的織物，是預備銷到國外去的，不是僅僅在國內謀銷路的。此刻國內這種織物廠還不多，我們當然是出品力求精良。旣要出品力求精良，這資本一定要寬裕了。不然，我們的貨品一出去，國外暢銷，我們要是資本不充足，就有周轉不靈之慮了。」（八一）</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>禮拜六與游藝界</h3>
<p>— 新影</p>
<p>禮拜六在上海，也許在整個世界，是游藝界最活躍的日子，比禮拜天更熱鬧。如果把每一游藝場的遊客，統計一下，禮拜六一定比禮拜天多。因此到了每一個禮拜六，游藝界凖會把陳容刷新一下呢！</p>
<p>先就京劇說起，每一家京戲館，禮拜六一定要排好戲。如果排了新戲，也會揀一個禮拜六第一次上演。我們在童年時候，老早就曉得上海的戲館，在禮拜三，六會演日戲。日戲的票價比夜戲便宜，禮拜六戲又好，因此，會打算的人，在上海看戲，一定揀禮拜六，這是我們在鄉下時早就聽慣了。</p>
<p>電影院裏不拘是外片，國產片，第一輪，或第二，三輪影院，換片子也每是揀禮拜六。而每一個電影院裏，一到了禮拜六，賣座的熱鬧，不拘大小，總是甚於半日。</p>
<p>游藝場到了禮拜六，一週一次，也會把游藝節目調整，或刷新一下，添加新鮮的游藝，也總是在禮拜六擇吉登台。而每一個游藝場裏，禮拜六那天，不拘是折天或夜晚，每個場子會擠滿了遊客，甚至會在大門口掛出了「客滿」的牌子，把鐵門拉攏着。</p>
<p>禮拜六那天，凡是跳舞場裏，會有茶舞或舉行各種特別節目的表演。舞客的衆多，會使每一個舞女不太應酬。現在雖是有著宵禁，上海的跳舞禮拜六晚上有的還是會通宵營業，跳到天明的。</p>
<p>上海各個游藝場所，在禮拜六所以比禮拜天更見熱鬧，也並非無因：為的一般的洋行或機關，禮拜六下午和禮拜天全日，每是停止公辦的。但禮拜天，你如果玩了一個整夜，第二天是禮拜一，九點鐘一定要上寫字間，不是連睡的時候都沒有嗎？不若禮拜六晚上，與之所至，玩他一夜，第二天禮拜，僅可在白天睡他半天，滿不在乎的。不錯，是這原因哩。</p>
<h3>藝華公司訪問記</h3>
<p>— 海翼</p>
<p>藝華公司在中國電影界的過去曾經吸收過全上海最優秀的導演，所拍的影片，也化過很大的資本，以他當時煊赫的情形看，也並不比現在中國聯合影片公司差到那裏。</p>
<p>直到戰前，藝華公司似乎稍稍受了點挫折，到現在藝華公司也已恢復製片，雖然因為他們環境特殊，但他們仍繼續奮門，這種精神是很可佩服的</p>
<p>但是最近由各方面傳出許多對藝華公司不利的謠傳，尤其是「楚霸王」公映前後，我們聽見了許多關於他們不利的消息，為了澈底明瞭藝華的立場及以後製片方針，特地造訪藝華公司現在的監製人嚴幼祥先生，承他很坦白的說出四點，並且希望各界能信任藝華公司，他們一定能循着觀衆所願望的路綫，攝製有意義的作品。</p>
<p>第一，關於以後製片方針，——：幼祥先生說得很直率，他說：「在這樣惡劣的環境中工作，（他們的攝影場在越界築路）雖然會遇見許多困苦，但我們決不攝製怪誕，荒唐和含有毒素的作品，這一種信念，在過去作品中，果然可以看得出來，就是以後，我們也堅持這樣主張。」</p>
<p>第二，我又提出外面許多為，我們願以一萬分的誠意表示，這完全絕對無稽的，好在與論很公正，他們還未被蒙蔽，這雖然是本公司大幸，實在也是中國電影界的大幸。」說到這裏他用更堅決的口氣說：「我們以後當以行動來擊破中傷者的陰謀，這一點，還希望與論界能幫助我們。」</p>
<p>第三，我提到了最近公映的「楚霸王」，有人看過此片以後，認為有隱射的意思在裏面，而嚴先生說得很好，他說：「楚霸王在編導者的本意，我敢以藝華公司立場聲明，絕對沒有一點點隱射作用，但是因為事先沒有經過審慎的考慮，就草率地製成影片，直到公映以後，經過大家的指正，才發覺許多流弊，所以「楚霸王」的失敗，我們並不譯言，主要的流言，大都是說什麼藝華公司的影片將在南京開映啦，又是什麼在蘇州開映啦，幼祥先生表示：「最近有人散佈流言，說我們公司裏的新片在淪陷區公映，這一種蓄意破壞的行，設想，還是為了全劇的主題不明鮮的關係，這一點，還希望文化界給我們一點幫助，使我們的作品能夠達到完善的地步，不致於像「楚霸王」那樣，使人曲解，使人誤會」。他的話說到這裏，口氣變得非常低沉而　誠懇，他又接下去說：「所以，我們決定以後每一張影片開拍以前，所有劇本一定先請大家指點以後，才決定開拍，免得以後再發生同樣的情形。……」</p>
<p>第四，我們大約提到一點電影從榮昌私生活的問題，他也希望外界能多督促他們，使他們能夠更積極地向上。藝華公司呢，一定也會更堅毅的奮門下去，還希望各界能夠給他一點指教。</p>
<p>最後，我們說起蘇州東和館開映藝華影片的事，他說起先還不知道，現在已把合同撕毀了，片子也在陸續地收回來</p>
<p>當我告辭出來的時候，我司，希望能堅守着這幾條信念，健全地長成起來，在中國電影界中，你們也是一支有力的生力軍呵！</p>
<h3>卓别麟近影</h3>
<p>— （穆）</p>
<p>卓別林現在製作一部片，「獨裁者」（The　Dictator）。這是「喜」劇，但以獨裁者為題材，這是多末嚴重的事呢。卓氏有着更新的姿態出現，他開口了，把譏諷擲向那些「獨夫」。笑，笑，笑，讓大家笑罷。</p>
<h3>「未免有情」殺青後</h3>
<p>— 海生</p>
<p>四年以前，當我在杭州的時候，在那裏演出的一班社話劇團，曾將拙著長篇小智「墮落的女人」編了一部戲，內容是描寫杭州女招待生活的陰暗面，編劇者是秦藕庵，我也參加一部份的意見和導演的工作，公演以後，成績雖不能說怎樣成功，卻沒有使我失望</p>
<p>最近，我和大世界聯及話劇社的社員們比較接近，經他們的慫恿，將我埋葬在心底的「願望，」又復活起來，經三星期之久，寫成了這部「未免有情，」它的內容是敘述一位坤伶程秋萍，在惡劣環境的逼迫中，得到俠義青年張志宏的救助，纔能夠脫離而保持自已的清白，意義上是以提高坤伶人格為目標，揭破一般有財有勢的劣紳的本來面目，這部戲經聯友社審定採用，總算它有了一條出路。</p>
<p>現在，聯友社已定十四號夜場初次公演，是編劇主任未炎担任導演的，這團體裏擁有徐紉秋，尹夢石，許雲麗，楊美媚，等優秀演員，我想定會有良好的成績，希望觀衆能給我們一個忠實，客觀和善意的批導和批評。</p>

<h3>舞女是不是一種良好職業</h3>
<p>許多人遇見一件幾個見解不同的議論時，兩喜觀拿一句話來解決，說是仁者見仁，智者見智，所謂比亦一是非也，彼亦一是非也，這麼一來，對於孰是孰非的一個問題，就算解決了。</p>
<p>考說文日正為「是」，可見「是」字的意義，是絕對的，譬如說，我是陳小田，就可以說，除我以外的人物，皆非陳小田，這舞廳是仙樂，就可以說其他舞廳皆非仙樂。但要曉得，「是」不一定是好，「非」个一定不好，「是非」是一問題，「好壞」又是另一問題。</p>
<p>（十七）　依據經濟學的原理來講，必須社會上有一種需要，纔會產生出一種職業來。換句話說，就是職業的產生，是為着供給社會上需要的。再換句話說，如果社會上沒有這種需要時，這種職業也就根本不能存在了，所以有了要吃要穿的人，才有糧食店，酒菜館，綢布店和裁縫舖？有了病人，才有醫生和藥房，有了喜觀跳舞的客人，才有舞場和舞女，照這麼講起來，舞女當然是一種職業了。當時有一位朋友駁我道，照你這樣講，馬路上的呌化子，難道也是社會上所需要的，為什麼社會並沒需要而他們還能存在呢？我說，實在也有一般人在需要着，倘若社會上絕對沒有一個人肯掏銅子給他們時，我可以斷定早就沒有呌化子了</p>
<p>從政治方面講，凡一種職業，總應該對於社會有些良好的影響，否則，就應該予以糾正或取締，現在我們應該研究舞女這種職業，對於社會是不是有良好的影響了。據我的觀念，無論何種職業，其本旨對於社會的影響，都是良好的，至於其所發生的不良影響，都是從業員的誤解和過失，譬如醫生這職業，本是為療病救苦的，律師這職業，原本是保障人權的，至於因盡了義務而收受些報酬，當然是情當理得，若是他們過於自私自利，或草率從事，以致對於病情案情弄錯了，就要對社會發生不良的影響，但決不能此就說醫生和律師是不良的職業罷。所以舞女這職業，雖說是供人娛樂，但正當的娛樂，也不能不說是人生必需的要件，所以我勸一班做舞女的，要認清自已的職業，不要自輕自賤，不要惟利是圖，不要玩怠業務，不要開條斧弄圈套，客人來跳的時候，不論張三李四，始終要保持着和藹的笑意，坐　子和買票出去的時候，始終要保持著興趣的態度，客人如有非份要求的時候，應該問他能不能達到結婚底目的，至於如此云云，須到結婚後方可照辦，如此則旣不會拆散人家美滿的家庭，自已又保持了高尚的人格，倘若個個舞女，都能依照着上面所說的去做，那末有誰能說舞女不是個良好職業呢。</p>
<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一四〇）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>明朝右都御史卻會判斷元代的冤案</p>
<p>數年前我在北平看過山西梆子班的旦小桂演過全本的「六日雪」，她們的劇情，就有很多地方與此不相同的。第一：是賓娥的父親實秀才，因赴京趕考，恐弱女一人在家無人照管，乃將娥送在蔡家為童養媳，並以金鎖為記，蓋娥年衹十四五，尚未與昌宗合　也。又老旦詞中，亦云：「我兒小小年紀，竟有此孝心」。還有一次看見某報記載賓娥的事跡，說娥實係被斬而死，死後證明其邑乾旱三載，而墓碑上係書孝女賓娥諸字，並非蔡夫人或蔡賓氏字樣，這也足以證明那個「娶」字是不對的。況且張驢兒的垂涏賓娥，亦因她尚未與昌宗成婚，所以才起下不良之心，比較上也覺得近情一些。第二：張驢兒不但不是蔡家的僕人，而他的母親也不是蔡家的傭工，照晉梆子所演是：蔡母一日出外討債，債主被迫，懷恨在心，將銀兩交付後，暗約無賴數人刦蔡母於途中，彼等去後，適張驢兒母子以家鄉飢饉，行乞過此，見路旁綑一婦人，遂向前解救。蔡母以其有救命之恩，乃將驢兒母子留養家中，後見驢兒作事伶俐，因收為義子，劇詞中呼其母曰張嫣嫣者，是見其母確非蔡家傭工也。驢兒一步登天，忽起邪念，況他仗恃有救活蔡母之功，所以才敢橫行不端，這樣似乎也比無緣無故的一個僕人或女傭的兒子妄起邪念，圖謀霸佔主人的妻室和財產的，又覺得近情一點了。第三：驢兒旣已奸計得售，佔有蔡家產業，按理也應當像「烏盆計」的趙大似的。換件褶子穿穿，讓鳳衆們對他更起一種忿恨的心理，並且只換上一件華貴的衣服，就可以表現他已經佔有蔡家的財產啦。如此一來，也可以與賓娥被禁媽媽責打所唱的詞句相吻合啦。</p>

<p>自去冬至今春，某國在江浙皖內地大量採辦，由就近各海口運輸出口，綜計不下一百數十萬石後，致浮面鄉貨收空，產價逐步上漲。至三月七八日，無錫清粳，漲至十三元五六角有寄。雖自二月一日，海關設立五徵收處，徵收轉口稅，米麥向章無稅，停止徵收大道捐後，尚須加一切費用，每包兩元，合每石一元六七角，劃滬價須十五元以上。蕪湖秞米，產價上二元零，劃滬價須十四元。某國欲在內地採購，因之無從落手。於是僞組織方面，除在無錫限價十一元外，（斯時錫價已漲至十三元外，何能辦到。）一面並停止發給搬出證，禁止出運，不久市價果回跌一元。先是同業在錫常等處，辦成米共五萬包，駁至滸浦，擬由英輪運赴汕頭，詎為某方得悉，不准出運，米已到滸，勒令駁回，後絡續運滬銷售。在內地市價突漲，此間十四元限價，已有不能維持之勢。故豈米業一面召集行店客三方主業團體決，以存積尚多，應再盡力維持原限價。一面則如產價不回，販商勢必裏足，存貨銷馨，則慮　發生恐慌，故即函致英法兩當局注意，為未兩綢繆，或訂購洋米，或用其他方法，庶使來源不致間斷，以免臨時揝手不及，此監公會方在在壓平市價之下，應盡報告之責任者也。</p>
<p>二　評價會之成立</p>
<p>旋於三月十日，荷英工部局何華總辦，電話來邀店方張君念萱，行方朱君子香，符君前耕，與余前往討論米市情形，局方糧食委員會西人愛佛蘭亦在座，認為目前訂購洋米，負責虧墊，諸多困難，若至必不得已時，緩緩逐漸放高，亦未始非招集來源之道。惟高次皂白不分，市場混亂，殊屬非計，因建議組立評價委員會，局方稱善。因於十三日召集米號葉，南幫公所，常幫公所，碾米業公所，河貨聯合會，經售公會，等七團體。開聯席會席，決定組織評價委員會，於十五日成定，由行店客三方，各推委員五人，共十五人，訂定簡章，評定高次，並着手調查全滬銀行堆棧與本棧，詳細指數，以憑核計到銷存三者之多寡，而察趨勢。惟將來市價有變更之必需進，仍須秉承全體七團體委員會辦理。質言之，評價會衹有評價調查報告之義務，無執行變更市價之權也。</p>
<p>三　現市及將來之趨勢</p>
<p>自錫常等處停發搬出登，蕪湖停發納稅單後，僅恃以前預有領出者，可以裝運，無證單者，不得採購，市價故即陡落一元。無錫高粳，現售十二元四五角，合滬價十四元。蕪湖現售十一元，合滬價十二地八角。但有時並不一定，無搬出證，亦得出運者，是蓋視當事者之一時意思為如何耳。惟一二月來，某國除在蕪湖有少數採辦外，江浙方面，因價昂停辦。上海較內地為廉，故在滬市續有成辦，每逢市價低落則進取，回漲則停手，雖無統計，絡續不下約有十餘萬包，可知非不進取，實待機而沽也。至此次評價會之調查工作，比較以前詳細，故尚未竣事。除派專員先行逐一調查銀行堆棧，暨本堆棧家數，發給調查表，俾為隨時填就外，至目前為止，查得銀行堆棧共十六家，計米數為三十二萬米千包，本堆棧則共有九十家上下，惟甚零星。其詳細指數，尚待查明。大譜亦在三十餘萬。總共以七十萬包，每包以一石三斗計順九十石之譜，尚可供三個月之用。雖來原不能暢旺，然商人謀利，如水趨叡，但期劃算不致虧折，販運尚可不乏。如照現市蘇皖產價，倘可順利運輸，則劃諸滬價，已可通徑。為整個社會生活計，目前按照原定限價，似可毋庸放價。惟米號業方面，以向行家十四元買進，則須加一切費用與沾潤，故已定四月一日起加增四角，自在情理之中。否則智短時犧牲則可，長期賠貼，則不能也。</p>
<p>四　洋米價漸相接近</p>
<p>自國米價恪漸趨高漲，遷邏仰光洋米，亦為各處及華北之訂購，較前已漲一元餘，然已有逐步走近之可能。如滬市勝餘之西貢。售每包十七元，折合市石在十四元。小絞，售每包十五元八角，折合市石在十三元一角之間。而最近西貢報價，約每包十八元七角，合每市石連一切申費，約十五元一二角。若是，國米再漲一元，即有人去訂購矣。故國米洋米價格之漲落，有息息相通之關係，業中人不容忽視也。查天津方面，曾訂購過洋米共五十萬包，已到經三分之一，餘則出月絡續可到。小絞米，定價為十二元五角，折合市石為十六元六七角，加津費，津價最低以八七匯水折實，合售十七元四角，現市最高，折實售二十元，獲利尚厚。故洋米暫惟該處可以通購，共總價值，在一千萬元之譜。此間過漲，或有一二個月之後，其間看某國走銷如何，萬一內外價高貨枯，則亦必定洋米無疑，然有此一重保障，則決不會蹈　昔飛黃騰達之覆轍。滬人僅可勿慮為無米之炊也。　「二十六年五月。中央頒佈糧食調節辦法之第三項。有如囚國內糧食缺乏。應為有免稅或減稅洋米麥以資調劑之必要時，應會呈行政院核准後，責成實部農本局，或糧食運銷局購運，不准商人自由購運，以防流弊」。所以滬關洋米麥免稅，是未得政府之准許者，因之近有粵省潮梅，及閩浙各地。紛請免稅進口洋米，已為財部一一批駁不准，轉飭粵閩浙各省財廳遵照；蓋值此戰時國家經濟，外匯力求平衡之際，則此問題，確屬相當嚴重。茲再不厭求詳，中述數量驚人，大量洋麥洋粉之訂購如下：</p>
<p>五　定購洋粉麥之驚人</p>
<p>吾國國麥產量缺少，向不數用。自抗戰以還，交通梗阻，捐費重疊，益復左支右絀。平常則在次年三四月間，方告缺少，而去年至冬閒，即已感凋零，加之去年東北及華北，均告歉收，（哈爾濱產麥特豐，去年衹三成以外收　）,故申粉北銷特旺，因之從去年十一月十六日起，中粉廠初輒訂閘美麥，繼以澳大利價賤質良，改購澳麥，至本年三月十十八日為止，共訂購過澳麥廿三船，美麥八船半，（內天津廠。澳麥二船，青島廠澳麥一船，同業與寗波廠澳麥二船，美麥半船），每船以八千頓計，須二十五萬二千頓，合司馬秤，四百二十三萬三千六百擔。定價，扯以每擔法幣七元八角計，總價值須三千三百餘萬元有奇。澳麥定價，最高八元一角，最低七元三角七分，美麥定價，最高八元〇四分，最低六元七角五分。除已到磨粉不計外，廠存及未到約供三個月之需。去冬各產區，多遭水災，不能下種，今庚生產量必大減，兼之各游擊區之粉廠被佔後，均有復工之現象。益以申粉北銷之殷，此後洋麥續購，決難中止耳。</p>
<p>天津為華北及粉市薈萃之區，除當地出粉，與申粉日粉運銷外，尚供不敷求。故自去年十月至今，直接定購洋粉，為數棊鉅。滬糧商亦跟蹤定購，惟數不及天津之多，且十之七八，亦轉售北運。茲將數字列後。</p>
<p>天津。定購五百五十萬包。</p>
<p>上海。定購一百六十萬包。</p>
<p>烟台。定購十餘萬包。</p>
<p>上述澳粉占三分之一，美粉占三分之二，（美粉不及澳粉之有黏性）。日粉尚不在內。定價約扯每包四元，計共值三千萬元有奇。天津已到銷去者，約百餘萬包，其餘約出月絡續可到，滬定已到五六十萬包，大數亦在出月中可到。津申走銷暢達，現存不多，洋麥未到前，洋粉售價，高出華粉二三角，現申廠之粉，原料但係洋麥，品質可與洋粉相埒，故津申二地售價與華粉同，最近，津市售五元二角，澳粉多售一二角，最低四元八角五分。中市最高售五元一角，最低售四元一角五分，國粉前最高售四元九角，现最低售四元四角。国麥现售市秤每百觔七元左右，而洋麥劃市秤百觔，不過六元五六角，且與國麥比例，價尚可升二三角。故皆樂購買外匯關係，有所不便之故。將來洋麥到滬，勢必就近採購無疑，綜合定購之洋米，洋麥，洋粉，三項。共總價值為七千數百萬元之鉅，來日方與未艾，將不知伊於胡底，此則為戰時外匯，深抱杞憂者也。</p>
<p>工商談助</p>
<h3>紗布前途之隱憂</h3>
<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>說也痛心，自已國內，擁有豐富的原料，卻給人家去享受，而自已要反仰給於國外，這是何等傷心的一件事！我們知道，戰前的華商紗廠所用的紡紗原料，大部份（約三分之一以上）是採辦本國棉的，紡十支至十六支粗紗的，不外購自東溝，北新涇，太倉，下沙等棉花；紡二十支的，是漢口細絨，通州，天津粗絨等花；紡三十二支至四十二支細紗的，是天津美種，山東美種，和上靈寶，鄭州，等花；真是取乏不盡，用之不竭。自從日本侵略戰爭爆發至今，原料地隨著軍事的變化，大部淪陷。（在軍事觀點上，是一城一地的得失，無關全局，可是在二商觀點上說，卻影響非淺。）有的被強暴有掠奪，有的被日，偽，所統制，有的因戰禍而被阻，特區裏　獲茍全的各華商紗廠，在無貨可辦的窘迫局面之下，不得不忍痛暢辦外棉。外棉又因外匯緊縮的關係，與稅餉，水腳，保險，棧租等的負担，花的成本加重，獲利日薄，反轉來說，極厚的利潤，卻被敵人強行剝削去了。記得去秋紗市的黃金時代，二十支標凖紗價，曾達每件國市五百十元左右的最高峰的新紀錄，那時辦本棉原料，尚可設法購得，所以每件紗平均的盈利竟達一百五十元以上。而今改用外棉之後，例如二十支原料的美棉米特林每担須八十二元九角，印棉白洛去須七十二元一角，統扯總須八十元左右，以每件紗用花三百五十斤算，花本就須二百八十元了。再加上開繳費約四十元，（均以紡二十支論，）有的廠家的開繳費或須四十五元，開繳費中約製造費二十元，管理費運營業費十五元，財務費五六元，每件紗的總成本，就須三百二三十元了。現在市售三百八九十元，每件紗約可賺六七十元，假使行市再飛躍至五百元的話，外棉價非但會跟進，而且很不易購辦，往年孤島上華商紗廠的一時奇盈，不過如墨花一現。何況日紗日布的傾銷區域的日廣，最近如東疋行情的堅昂，和國布以運輪不便而日就養靡，華商紗廠的未來，恐未許如往年之抱樂觀吧！</p>

<h3>南北貨　川耳再跌後望回升</h3>
<p>四川木耳、邇來養有運到、客方不耐久守者、乃不惜虧本求售、故市勢復疲再跌近進十元、昨聞客貨開出中包川耳一百餘包、價為一百九十二元、惟市價至此、似已有度、如去胃見增、　有否極泰來之望、</p>

<h3>滇越路要訊</h3>
<p>— 愨</p>
<p>行車時刻更改　貨運能力增强</p>
<p>茲接海防快訊，滇越鐵路行車時刻，已於三月十五日起全部更改，又悉凡取道海防經滇越路赴內地，而欲搭米許林快車者，均須憑正式車票，預定車座。但因乘客衆多，座次有限，故的需在一星期以前，卽行登記，始能定到座位。又該路有來回票出售，限期爲三十五天，如欲延期者，應補納來回票價百分之十，得延長十五日。倘補納來回票價百分之二十，則可延長至三十五日，逾期即行作廢。</p>
<p>按滇越鐵路，在二月份以前，其運輸貨物之能力，每月僅能運四五千噸，故囤積海防，待運內地之貨物，竟達八萬餘噸之多。現經該路常局積極改進，其運輸能力，已由每月四五千噸增至每月九千噸，不久並可達一萬二千噸。目下積存海防之貨物，已剩五萬餘噸，再經相當時日，必能大量减少囤積，實造福貨運不少。按中國旅行社，前因海防堆積貨物過多，無法輸運，曾暫停接受經由海防內運之貨運，現在該社在防存貨，經近來之努力，巳多半運出，迄三月上旬止，尙有八百噸之譜，存於防地，的四月底始可全部出淸，聞自下月中旬起，或能恢復代客承運。</p>

<h3>旅行常識（二）</h3>
<p>— 琅</p>
<p>乘公路汽車</p>
<p>（一）公路汽車，沿途灰沙奇重，所帶行李，爲灰泥侵入，極易汚損。兼之一路雨量較多，倘保護不周，更易淋汚。故凡乘公路汽車旅客之行李必須用大油布（或其他避水之料）嚴密包紮，始免沙雨汚損。（二）沿途灰沙之大，不獨沾汚行李，且易自頸間侵入身上。一帽固不可少，尤應用大毛巾或布圍巾緊包頸際。（三）乘公路汽車自昆明出發者，於購票後，應將行李於前一日送達車站，始能與本人同車運出。不然行李必無法同車帶走，遲到之後，煩惱必多。（四）隨身務宜携帶鋪蓋一份，以便於車停小站過夜時之應用，因普通小站之客棧，鋪蓋旣均汚穢不堪，且多臭蟲白蝨侵擾，殊不能作爲鋪蓋之用耳。（五）如在可能範圍，應帶小軟墊一只，鋪墊於車座上，不獨舒適，且减疲苦。（六）如畏暈車，當以少進食物為佳，酸性水菓，食之最宜。</p>
<h3>旅行通問</h3>
<p>本埠　余安成君問由滬至渝，取道浙東及越南之途徑及旅費。</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) After the Japanese occupied Xinhui City, they planned to divide their forces to attack the Siyi region from multiple directions. They specially mobilized thirty to forty large and small ships, gathered in Guanghai, Taishan. On the afternoon of the 6th, at 5:00 PM, they sent hundreds of soldiers, attempting to land on the sandbanks of Guanghai. Simultaneously, they dispatched aircraft to bomb Chinese positions. Chinese defenders bravely resisted with fierce artillery fire. Villagers from Taishan fled to Hong Kong and Macau, and the situation was dire. On the Xinhui front, Japanese troops advanced to Daze. On the evening of the 6th, fierce fighting broke out between Chinese and Japanese forces in the area of Daze and Siqian. The Chinese Air Force flew to Xinhui on the 4th to assist in the battle, inflicting heavy losses on the Japanese. They also flew to Jiangmen and sank two Japanese shallow-water warships and damaged five or six others. (Special dispatch, 11:00 PM on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) After fierce counter-attacks by Chinese forces, the Japanese army in Jiangxi was in a difficult situation by the 6th. The Chinese troops counter-attacking Wuning were engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese forces in the vicinity of the city suburbs. The Japanese troops who attacked Gao'an from the west, approximately a regiment, suffered heavy casualties after being ambushed by Chinese forces in the area of Sanlikeng, Longtan Bridge, and Qianjie west of the city. Those who attempted to cross the Gan River were still engaged in a standoff with Chinese forces across the river. The Japanese troops who advanced towards Xiushui were intercepted by Chinese forces and were unable to advance. Certain Chinese units launched a counter-attack towards Jing'an and Fengxin, engaging in bloody battles with the Japanese forces in the vicinity. There were no changes on the east bank of the Gan River and the Fu River. (Special dispatch, 11:00 PM on the 7th)</p>
<p>Sihui The Chinese troops counter-attacking Jiangmen made rapid progress. A vanguard of plainclothes soldiers rushed into the urban area at 8:00 AM on the 6th, followed by the main force. The Japanese troops retreated in panic to Tangxia. The Chinese troops took advantage of the victory and pursued and killed over 200 Japanese soldiers and wounded countless others. Many spoils of war were seized. Jiangmen was officially recovered by the Chinese forces. Also, a small unit of Japanese troops that secretly attacked Xinhui failed to retreat in time and was surrounded by Chinese forces, ready to be annihilated. (Dispatch on the 7th)</p>

The corpses of officers and soldiers were transported from Jiangmen and Lecong to Guangzhou for cremation. According to eyewitness accounts of coolies at the scene, approximately 800 horses were burned to death. (Dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Sihui After the Chinese army recovered Guanyao, they continued to attack towards Fengyong, Yaoxi, and Jinshan Temple.

At 9:00 AM, the Japanese army dispatched a unit of over 200 men from Foshan, accompanied by one tank and eight armored vehicles, along the highway to reinforce. They engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the area of Baisha Bridge and Daxiaogang. (Dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Xiushui The Japanese troops who invaded Gao'an, after being continuously intercepted by Chinese forces for days, were unable to stand their ground. On the 7th, they all retreated north.

As a result of the counter-attack by the Chinese army in Conghua, they have recovered Taipingchang, Shijiao, and Yangcun. (Associated Press dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>Wuzhou Several Chinese aircraft departed from a certain location on the morning of the 7th, separately attacking Japanese positions on various fronts in Guangdong, achieving many victories. Also on the morning of the 7th, six Japanese aircraft took off from Beihai, attacked Longzhou along the Ming River, and dropped many bombs in the city at 10:35 AM. (Dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Wengyuan The Chinese army in the Huaxian area advanced south along the Yuehan Road at noon on the 6th. In the evening, they once attacked Jiangcun, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese army. At night, due to the Japanese army using many artillery pieces to form a fire net and fiercely attack the Chinese army, the Chinese army withdrew and defended the area north of Jiangcun. At the same time, the Chinese army has conquered all the strongholds west of the highway between Xin Street and Huaxian. This morning, they are encircling and annihilating the remaining Japanese troops entrenched in the Overseas Chinese Yici in Yuzhongtan. The Chinese assault troops attacked the Japanese troops in Hengtan, Liantang, and Xincun on the evening of the 5th, and after a fierce battle until the morning of the 6th, the Japanese troops suffered heavy losses and retreated in disorder. The Chinese army once recovered the above-mentioned places, but due to terrain limitations, they automatically withdrew to their original positions. After the Japanese troops at Longkouzhuang were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army, the Japanese army used fierce artillery fire to densely bombard the Chinese army, and sent troops to copy the Chinese army. At noon on the 6th, a unit of over 400 Japanese cavalry, under the cover of aircraft, copied into Shidong and other places via Pingshan, Lianglong, and Huaxian City (northeast of Huaxian City), attempting to contain the Chinese army in Xin Street, but were intercepted by the Chinese army. After a fierce battle until dusk, the Japanese army was unable to hold out and retreated to Huangdong in the southeast. In this battle, over 30 Japanese soldiers were killed. This morning, the Chinese army continued to advance towards Longkouzhuang. (Dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Certain location On the morning of the 5th, a team of Chinese aircraft flew to Guangzhou for reconnaissance, circling the city several times without dropping bombs. The Japanese troops were extremely panicked. Over a thousand Japanese merchants, women, children, and disabled soldiers in the city fled in a panic. Guangzhou has now entered a state of martial law. Under the pretext of searching for weapons, the Japanese army took the opportunity to rob, rape, and plunder, which is even worse than before. People are in a state of anxiety and cannot live in peace. (Dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>Guilin On the evening of the 5th, two to three hundred Japanese troops crossed the river to Mawu Xu (south of Conghua), and over six hundred Japanese troops also crossed the river to Mumian. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army in the Maluo Mountain area. On the same evening, a unit of Japanese troops also arrived at Jiekou in Conghua. Suddenly, dense gunfire was heard in that area and they are now in contact with a guerrilla team from a certain Chinese division. (Dispatch on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to neutral sources here, after the Japanese army used great effort to capture Nanchang, their momentum seemed to have waned. Therefore, in the battles in the area south of Nanchang in recent days, the Japanese side has not been able to break through. According to reports from the Japanese side here, the Japanese Air Force has continuously dispatched aircraft in recent days to bomb the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line, in an attempt to disrupt the Chinese army's rear and delay the momentum of the Chinese army's counter-attack on Nanchang. The fighting near Gao'an is still very fierce. Although the Japanese army has repeatedly attempted to cross the Jin River to attack southwest, they have ultimately failed. The two sides are currently holding each other across the Jin River. The Japanese troops in Wuning, due to being blocked from advancing west, have now changed their direction and are advancing south of Wuning, attempting to join forces with the Japanese troops on the south bank of the Xiushui River to advance in a roundabout way and encircle the Chinese troops in Xiushui. (Express News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>

(Express News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to reliable sources, the Chinese military authorities believe that the main force in the decisive battle in the future will focus on the air force. In order to control air supremacy and prevent Japanese aircraft from rampaging within the Chinese defense lines, they have ordered the Central Aviation Administration to allocate 250 new-style aircraft to be under the command of the Southwest Headquarters, so as to cover the actions of ground troops when launching a full-scale general counter-offensive. (Express News Agency dispatch, 7th)</p>

<p>(Chongqing) It is rumored that the authorities of the British, French, and American embassies are particularly concerned about the bombing of foreign churches by Japanese aircraft in various parts of China. They believe that this is Japan's military response to the loans granted to China by various countries. Currently, the protests from various countries are limited to those raised by the consuls of each incident location. However, if the Japanese side continues to bomb indiscriminately, the governments of various countries will submit the strongest possible protests to Japan based on the information collected by their respective embassies stationed in Chongqing. It is reported that the various churches of all countries in China have recently exerted pressure on their domestic governments, demanding that they take action against Japan. Furthermore, the British diplomatic community is very concerned about Japan's stirring up anti-British sentiment in North China in order to prevent Britain from providing further economic assistance to China and to urge Britain to adopt a more peaceful policy towards Japan.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>A Perspective on the Puppet Anti-British Movement</h3>
<p>Recently, Japanese warlords have instigated puppets in the Japanese-occupied areas, both north and south, to engage in anti-British movements. Puppet newspapers in Nanjing, Hangzhou, Shanghai, and Kaifeng have all promoted the movement extensively. Anti-British slogans have been posted everywhere in the streets and alleys. Recently, the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, visited Shanghai to discuss Far Eastern issues with the Ambassador to China, Knatchbull-Hugessen. The Japanese warlords then instigated the puppets to intensify the movement, even distributing anti-British leaflets and posting anti-British slogans in western Shanghai to demonstrate to the two ambassadors. The purpose of the Japanese warlords in launching this movement, in addition to exploiting the historical Sino-British relations to arouse anti-British sentiment among the Chinese people, dividing China's resistance forces to achieve their plot of using Chinese against Chinese; is also to rape Chinese public opinion, attempting to use this to change Britain's views on China and end the aid-China movement, in order to reduce the resistance to their invasion of China.</p>
<p>Indeed, although there were unpleasant things in the past between Britain and China, in any case, it is not as tyrannical as Japan is today. Since the "September 18th" Incident, how much Chinese territory has been trampled on? How many Chinese people have been massacred? How much of China's economic and cultural undertakings have been destroyed? These unforgettable blood debts can only be ignored and unseen by traitors and puppets who shamelessly serve the enemy and recognize the thief as their father. For the Japanese warlords to attempt to cover up these immediate facts, and to exploit historical unpleasant events to arouse anti-British sentiment among the Chinese people, shifting the target away from Japan, in order to divide the forces of resistance, is no different from trying to catch fish by climbing a tree.</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of China is not only hostile to China, but also hostile to most countries in the world – especially Britain. The iron hooves of the Japanese warlords, from the Northeast to North China, Central China, South China, and even Hainan Island, have not only swallowed up all of Britain's interests in China; even Hong Kong, the Malay Peninsula, and India are under threat. In order to maintain her interests in China and to relieve the threat to Hong Kong, the Malay Peninsula and India, Britain has repeatedly aided China economically, strengthening China's resistance forces. Because Britain's interests in China are intertwined with China's independence and liberation, only by actively helping China to achieve victory as soon as possible can her interests in China be guaranteed. This assistance naturally increases the difficulties of Japan's invasion of China. Therefore, the Japanese warlords are very panicked about this. In addition to controlling foreign exchange in North China, banning legal tender, blockading the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, and excluding British commercial interests in China, using force to threaten the concessions in Tianjin and Shanghai, as retaliation, they also instigate puppets, rape public opinion, and launch anti-British movements.</p>
<p>The Japanese warlords are accustomed to using this kind of conspiracy. Two or three months ago, Ambassador Knatchbull-Hugessen went to North China to inspect. At that time, the Japanese warlords were suffering from a complete lack of progress in their invasion of China, and anti-war sentiment was growing at home, making them unsure whether to advance or retreat. Therefore, they used traitorous puppets, falsely using the name of various groups in North China, to appeal to Knatchbull-Hugessen for peace, hoping to change Britain's views on China, to act as a mediator, and to end the war under favorable conditions. However, after Knatchbull-Hugessen arrived in Tianjin, various popular groups in North China jointly issued a declaration, firmly expressing their support for the government and their determination to resist until the end, exposing the Japanese warlords' conspiracy, thwarting their plans. Although the purpose of this conspiracy is different from the previous one, the means are consistent. Their raping of public opinion and falsely using the name of popular groups in North China to appeal for peace are exactly the same. However, all the anti-British slogans in western Shanghai that were not protected by puppet police were torn down by the public. And Britain, having never been deceived by them before, will certainly not fall into their trap now.</p>
<p>Not only that, but Britain's aid to China was prompted by the Japanese warlords' invasion of China and their swallowing up of British interests in China. Therefore, unless the Japanese warlords voluntarily abandon their policy of invading China, her aid-China movement will not only not end, but will instead be strengthened in direct proportion to their invasion of China. Not only that, the endless aggression of the aggressors has led to a change in Britain's entire foreign policy. Chamberlain has reversed his past attitude of accommodating and tolerating aggressors and has taken on the responsibility of organizing an anti-aggression alliance, accepting restrictions in Eastern Europe. This change is very important in today's world, where Japan, Germany, and Italy are working together to engage in aggression. Having keenly felt that the policy adopted in the past was wrong, and wanting to prevent the aggression of Germany and Italy in Europe, she will naturally not let go of Japan in the Far East at the same time. Craigie's visit to Shanghai to discuss matters with Knatchbull-Hugessen is aimed at finding ways to strengthen her Far Eastern policy. Therefore, the Japanese warlords' instigation of puppets to oppose Britain only shows that they are at their wit's end, acting perversely and doing things backwards, working hard but getting nowhere.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Occupy New Nan Islands; France Protests to Japan; Japan Refuses; British Under-Secretary of State Responds to Member of Parliament's Question, Saying They Will Closely Liaise with France on This Matter</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Today, according to a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the French Ambassador to Japan visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Wednesday to protest against the Japanese military's occupation of the New Nan Islands, which was rejected. When asked whether the Japanese government would be willing to submit this matter to arbitration, the spokesperson replied that the New Nan Islands already belong to Japan, so there is no need for arbitration. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) Labour MP Mander asked the government in the Lower House today to explain the status of Japan's occupation of the New Nan Islands. Under-Secretary Butler replied that the New Nan Islands are located on the western side of a rather large archipelago. In 1933, the French government issued an order to include this island in its territory and obtained full sovereignty. However, on March 30, the Japanese government announced that it had placed the New Nan Islands and other islands claimed by France under the administrative jurisdiction of the Governor-General of Taiwan. As for the question of protest, it is a matter for the French government to decide. Mander asked whether Britain, which has an obligation to assist France in protecting its overseas territories, should join France in protesting against the occupation of French territory. Butler replied that the Lower House must know that this is a matter for the French government. The British government intends to closely liaise with France on this matter, as with other matters of common interest. Labour MP Benn asked whether this island is also strategically important to Britain. Butler replied that this island is indeed a strategically very important place. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>
<h3>Anti-War Undercurrent Among Japanese People</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to a recent arrival from Tokyo, the Japanese people have been increasingly anti-war recently. This phenomenon is also very evident at Tokyo Imperial University. After the head of the Department of Economics at Tokyo Imperial University, Eijiro Kawai, and the entire faculty of the department were dismissed for being anti-war, the Economics Department of the school was immediately suspended. However, this move still could not curb the anti-war undercurrent in other departments. Anti-war slogans were found at any time in quiet places on campus, and even warning words such as "Self-Destruction" were carved on the walls of the lecture halls with knives. Furthermore, the general business community used to compete to buy extra editions of newspapers, but now they are tired of hearing the sound of "extra editions," fearing that they will announce the National Mobilization Law or bond issuance. Middle and high school students with more leftist ideas have disappeared one after another, all having been arrested by the police and secret police. (Dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to a foreigner who recently came from Tokyo, reports of anti-war riots within the Japanese army have been heard from time to time, which is true. However, their scale is still small, lacking coordination, and unable to become a powerful force. The Japanese side keeps it secret and strictly prohibits newspapers from publishing it, so few people know about it. One piece of evidence can prove that this statement is not fabricated. In an article on the first day of the Osaka Asahi Shimbun about the suicide of the wife of Lieutenant Yuji Takanashi with a short sword, it was said that the reason was that her husband was fighting on the front line, many of his subordinates were killed or wounded, and a certain accident occurred to some of his subordinates, for which her husband bore a heavy responsibility, so she decided to encourage him with death. The so-called "certain accident" was an anti-war riot. This is a secret unintentionally revealed by the Japanese newspaper. (Dispatch on the 7th)</p>

<h3>Commentary from the Truth Report: The Significance of Japanese Southern Expansion - Occupation of the New Southern Islands as a Threat to Britain and France - Japanese Aggression Against Democratic Nations Unceasing</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Truth Report published an article entitled "Japanese Aggression in the South China Sea," stating, "The Japanese occupation of the New Southern Islands is not only a second blow to French Indochina, but also a new threat to the communication lines of Singapore, Hong Kong, and the Philippines. The strategic position of the New Southern Islands is sufficient to strengthen Japan's position in the Philippines, and the Japanese influence in the Philippines has long caused panic among the United States and the Philippine authorities. After the Japanese establish military bases in the New Southern Islands, they will have the possibility of achieving practical results from the years of work of their spies in the Dutch East Indies. In recent years, the Japanese have worked hard to enhance their commercial position in the Dutch East Indies, dumping Japanese goods in the local markets. Judging from the recent rumors that Japan, Germany, and Italy have reached an understanding regarding the Far Eastern markets, the new Japanese aggressive actions have special significance. The Japanese occupation of the New Southern Islands and Hainan Island proves that the Japanese offensive against the interests of Britain, France, and the United States is continuing in a systematic and resolute manner. The interests of Japan and Germany in China have inherent contradictions, but these contradictions are controlled by a common purpose, which is to drive the so-called democratic powers out of the Far Eastern markets, inflict heavy blows on their strategic position in the Pacific, and prepare for further aggressive offensives by Japan in the South China Sea."

<h3>Fu Zuoyi Encourages the People of Suiyuan to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Wuyuan: Since the Suiyuan Provincial Government moved to a certain place at the beginning of last month, Suiyuan, at the forefront of national defense, has shown a vibrant phenomenon. Chairman Fu Zuoyi, in addition to reorganizing and refreshing the Suiyuan garrison and guerrilla forces, has also made active progress in politics. First, he has thoroughly improved the people's lives, easing the collection of land taxes and surcharges from the 21st to the 28th years of the Republic, and exempting more than ten kinds of taxes such as the tooth tax, business license tax, and livestock transaction tax. He also called on the people to expand spring farming to ensure wartime food production. Secondly, there are detailed plans for organizing the masses, training the masses, and arming the masses, with the aim of coordinating politics and military affairs, and unifying the strength of the people and the military. At the same time, he issued a proclamation to the compatriots in western Suiyuan and the entire province, encouraging the people to help the government and the army to jointly resist Japan, urging everyone to unite and fulfill their responsibilities to serve the country and the nation, and advising them not to sell Japanese goods, not to use Japanese goods, not to be Japanese detectives or spies, not to perform labor or military service for the Japanese, and not to plant opium, etc. Currently, Suiyuan has become a tax-free zone, and the tide of expanding spring farming and the people's enthusiasm for resisting Japan has surged in the borderlands. The general public is particularly close to Chairman Fu, who has returned from battle, like a father or brother, and everyone is inspired. (Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<h3>The Glorious War History of Cai Jinhua - Active on the Shores of Taihu Lake, Repeatedly Defeating the Japanese Army - The Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway Almost Entirely Under Control</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Officials are now denying the news of the death of the heroine Cai Jinhua, who is active in the Taihu Lake area. This news was reported by a guerrilla fighter who is recuperating in Chongqing. He was injured in southern Anhui and came to Chongqing for treatment. According to him, Cai Jinhua has definitely not died. Although the Japanese army had found a female corpse at the time, the female corpse was the wife of the puppet county magistrate of Changxing. Because the clothes worn by the corpse and the fourteen-inch-long women's shoes were Cai's, the Japanese mistakenly believed that the corpse was Cai Jinhua. When Cai Jinhua's troops were surrounded by the Japanese army on December 25th last year, Cai Jinhua immediately devised a way to break through the encirclement. At that time, Cai Jinhua was wearing a Japanese military uniform, disguised as a Japanese soldier. The Japanese army was fooled by her, and she was able to break through. Cai's original home is in Changxing. Not only did she break out of the dangerous area herself, but none of her subordinates died either, and 312 Japanese rifles were seized. Most of the Japanese army was defeated by Cai's four hundred men. The fact at the time was that Cai led her troops to pretend to surrender to the Japanese army. After obtaining the Japanese weapons, they immediately revolted. They were surrounded by the Japanese army, but Cai defeated them with a little trick. However, the base of Cai's troops at that time had been discovered by the Japanese army, so they led their troops to move westward. The speaker also said that he had personally seen Cai and her troops active in the Wuhu area. Cai is only twenty-five years old, and used to be a traveling entertainer, so she knows martial arts. Wherever she goes, she is welcomed by the local people. It is said that Cai travels on horseback around Taihu Lake for more than a thousand miles every year, and also goes to places like Nanjing and Shanghai. Majishan Island in Taihu Lake used to be where Cai met heroes. It is said that at one time, because a certain military officer wanted to forcibly marry Cai as a concubine, she contacted the heroes of the green forests and fought fiercely with the officers and soldiers. As a result, the government army was defeated, and Cai was not taken away. Later, she formally married a hero of the green forests, surnamed Chen, who was quite powerful in the Taihu Lake area. The local farmers all respected him. At that time, the county government had encouraged Chen to surrender, and reorganized his troops into a security team, but Chen was executed by the county government two months after surrendering, and Cai Jinhua was also imprisoned. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Cai was pardoned and released from prison, and had the opportunity to serve the country. She immediately summoned her old troops, with the responsibility of attacking the Japanese army. In December 1937, when the Japanese army attacked Nanjing, Cai led her troops to ambush in a certain place, and suddenly attacked the advancing Japanese army, capturing twenty Japanese trucks and one hundred and twenty rifles. Her activity in the following year caused the Japanese army to change color. The Nanjing-Hangzhou National Highway was almost entirely controlled and destroyed, making it impossible for the Japanese army to transport. The person also said that when he met Cai, Cai told him that she would soon go to Nanjing to attack. Cai's troops have more than 500 men and women. Although Cai is currently a widow, she still hopes to find a satisfactory husband after defeating the Japanese army, and return to Taihu Lake to restore the joy of her childhood.

He knew that the tracks were in good condition, but the number of vehicles was limited. Britain has repeatedly made representations to the Japanese government regarding the interests of Britons in the railway. On March 24, the British ambassador to Japan, Craigie, made further representations to the Japanese government on this matter. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Italy Sends More Naval, Land, and Air Forces - To Invade the Small Country of Albania - More Than 30,000 Troops Land, Meeting Fierce Resistance - War News Confused, One Account Says Negotiations Are Still Underway</h3>
<p>(London) Europe was about to enter the quiet of Easter morning when news suddenly arrived that Italian troops had invaded Albania, causing a great shock. A semi-official Roman statement said that the Italian Navy and Army were taking joint action, and that 35,000 troops had landed on the Albanian coast at Valona, Durazzo, and San Giovanni. It also said that when the Italian troops launched their initial attack under the cover of artillery fire, the Albanian army resisted strongly, especially in Durazzo and Valona. The situation after that is unclear. According to Italian sources, the Italian troops have broken through the Albanian army's resistance in Durazzo and advanced into Albania. However, Albanian sources say that the Italian troops' two attacks on Durazzo have been repelled, but the Italian troops have indeed landed in Valona, and street fighting has broken out in the city. A Reuters reporter in the Albanian capital reports that the Italian government has accepted Albania's answer. (Reuters dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to news from the capital of Albania, Italy has made two demands to the Albanian government: (1) To allow Italian troops to be stationed in Albania permanently or temporarily; (2) To increase the number of Italians immigrating to Albania. The Albanian government rejected these demands because accepting them would be tantamount to acknowledging Italian protection. The Italian government responded by mobilizing troops and concentrating warships. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>Albanian Capital: After Italy submitted the ultimatum to the Albanian government, it immediately dispatched two air force squadrons, which arrived at 4:30 and 4:45 this morning to demonstrate, but the government and the House of Representatives were unmoved and decided to reject the ultimatum. This morning, more Italian planes came and scattered leaflets from the air, announcing that Italian troops had landed and warning the Albanian people not to resist, or they would be severely dealt with by force. In addition, they also advised the Albanian people to obey the Italian King and Emperor of Abyssinia, Victor Emmanuel III, saying that only by obeying the Italian King could peace be restored. The Italian Air Force also heavily bombed the port of Valona all night last night. The army that landed in that port encountered resistance from the Albanian regular army and volunteers. The port of Durazzo was also constantly bombed by Italian planes, but the Italian troops who landed in that port have been repelled by the Albanian regular army. In addition, the Albanian and Italian armies are also fighting fiercely in the port of Yaxingjini. The Albanian cabinet is continuing to meet to deal with the changing situation.

Unexpectedly, armed groups in the Albanian capital and other places staged serious demonstrations, which endangered the safety of Italian expatriates. Italy had no choice but to order several warships to transport hundreds of Italian expatriates, including many women and children, from the Albanian ports of Durazzo and Valona yesterday morning, back to their home country. At the same time, yesterday evening, troops were dispatched from the southern ports of Brindisi and Bari to Albania.

Although Britain does not have direct interests in that country, it cannot but pay attention to it for the general interest of world peace. As for the purpose of the three warships arriving there, I am not at liberty to say. I have not received any information that Italian troops have been concentrated in Bari and Brindisi. I have also not received a detailed report from Albania on its current views on negotiations with Italy. However, the British government has received denials that Albania has accepted an ultimatum that is contrary to its sovereignty and national integrity. (Reuters dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>Yugoslavia Panics - Cabinet Discusses Countermeasures</h3>
<p>Yugoslav Capital: After the Italian troops began their actions in Albania, although the Italian government had provided assurances that it would respect Yugoslavia's rights in the Adriatic Sea (Italy and Yugoslavia signed an agreement in 1937, agreeing to maintain the status quo in the Adriatic Sea), people here are still very anxious. It is said that the Italian authorities have asked Yugoslavia to take joint action against Albania, and have promised to share the city of Shkodër in Albania (which belonged to the Austro-Hungarian Empire before the European War and was later assigned to Albania by the Treaty of Paris) with Yugoslavia. It is also said that the Albanian authorities have asked Yugoslavia for help, so Yugoslavia's situation is very difficult. (Havas dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Italian Newspapers - Burying Their Heads in the Sand</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian newspaper *Il Giornale d'Italia* reported that "Albania experienced an uprising last year against King Zog and his pro-Italian policies, but the uprising was aborted midway and did not materialize. Now Albania is brewing another uprising, which is clearly of the same nature as last year's. Italy's dispatch of troops this time is not without reason. Italy and Albania have concluded an alliance, which clearly stipulates that if such a situation occurs, Italy may send troops to Albania. In the past, the Albanian people have regarded Italy as their natural protector, and Italy is now fulfilling its historical mission." (Haitong dispatch, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) All Roman newspapers issued extra editions today, announcing that Italian troops had occupied Albania. In addition to publishing official communiques, most newspapers published editorials. The extra edition of the newspaper *Il Popolo di Roma* declared, "To explain this action, we must base it on the history since 1927 and Italy's policies over the years. This policy is based on Italy's sincere friendship with the Albanian nation on the one hand, and Italy's vital interests in the Adriatic Sea on the other. Anyone who glances at a map will know that for the sake of defending its interests, Italy must take precautionary measures in the Adriatic Sea. From a geographical point of view, if a war breaks out, no matter who the enemy is, the presence or absence of the Albanian coast is a matter of life and death for Italy." (Haitong dispatch, 7th)</p>

<h3>Problems with US and Chinese Legislation Revision: Two Opposing Views; Baruch Says Economic Sanctions are Dangerous; Roosevelt Seems Quite Dilemma</h3>
<p>(Washington) Bernard Baruch, economic advisor to the American Peace Commission, declared today before a neutral committee in the Senate that "We cannot expect to live in permanent peace with countries that we economically oppress. Economic sanctions are inherently dangerous, because if they fail, they will lead to war. If an aggressor is determined to start a war, I highly doubt whether economic pressure from the United States can avert war." Baruch supported that all arms sales must be paid for in cash when other countries are at war and the United States is neutral. He believes this can be put into practice without affecting America's neutral stance. Baruch also said, "It is a fundamental error to believe that America will not join a war if it thinks American interests are being harmed. Germany has made this mistake once before." He believes that if America or the Western Hemisphere does not bury its head in the sand, and continues to speak out against dishonesty and barbarism, it should not be dragged into the vortex of European struggle. According to Baruch, who was chairman of the War Industries Board organized by President Wilson in 1918 and is now often consulted by President Roosevelt, "True neutrality has become an unrealizable concept, so the best course of action for the United States is to avoid joining the war as much as possible within its capabilities, maintain fair trade with all belligerents, help develop national defense, and prevent economic collapse. If we are confident that we can defend the Western Hemisphere, then the idea of economic warfare cannot exist. World commerce, upon which world peace and prosperity depend, is gradually being strangled by trade restrictions, tariffs on the exchange of goods, export quotas, and autarky." Secretary of State Hull intends to restore it, but the current Neutrality Act is further restricting it. (Reuters, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Following former Secretary of State Henry Stimson and banking magnate Bernard Baruch's opinions before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the Neutrality Act revision issue in the past two days, Roosevelt's close advisors recently commented that the government's position has become clearer and stronger because of Stimson's statement. On the contrary, the views expressed by Baruch could weaken the principles upon which the government has based its actions for several months. In other words, President Roosevelt sent a message to the League of Nations in early January this year, stating that there are other methods besides resorting to war to suppress totalitarian states. Doubts will arise about its practical effectiveness because of Baruch's views. At that time, some parties believed that after the current Neutrality Act is revised, they feared that the President would restore complete freedom or abuse power in diplomacy in accordance with the constitution. The government is eager to dispel this concern. Political figures said that after Stimson and Baruch expressed opposing opinions, it is difficult to predict how the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will decide on the Neutrality Act revision issue.

<h3>British Economic Magazine Discusses Chinese Finance; Hull Explains Trade with Manchukuo</h3>
<p>(London) The Economist magazine recently published an article discussing China's foreign debt, stating that although China's financial strength has been affected by the war, its determination to maintain credit has not been weakened. Taking salt affairs as an example, the Chinese government has established new order in certain places and can still collect salt tax within certain limits. Many small towns in the interior have enjoyed financial convenience, and domestic trade in the occupied areas of the east is still active, which shows the vitality of the Chinese nation. It is a pity that the budget requires a lot of money, and most commercial markets have been blocked. It is also difficult to repay small debts. However, one thing that can be determined without doubt is that if the method of paying the principal and interest of China's foreign debt can be adjusted in a fair manner, all bondholders will appreciate China's efforts to maintain credit and will definitely accept a temporary method, allowing it to have some breathing space. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull said today that "Manchukuo" purchased US$17,000,000 worth of goods from the United States in 1938, mostly military supplies and cotton. Steel accounted for US$1,556,000, kerosene accounted for US$4,000,000, and the rest were mostly machines and automobiles used to enhance the Japanese mechanized forces. In short, the American goods purchased by them mainly focused on military use. (Associated Press, 6th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-Polish Talks End; Poland Expresses Satisfaction; Romanian Minister Returns to London to Continue Talks on Forming an Anti-Aggression Front</h3>
<p>Warsaw The agreement recently concluded between Poland and the United Kingdom is in effect a defensive alliance treaty. Foreign Minister Beck had obtained the consent of General Smigly-Ridz, the Inspector General of the Army, in advance. After Easter, the United Kingdom and Poland will conduct talks on diplomatic and military matters to agree on various technical issues. Responsible officials here commented that the German claim that the Anglo-Polish agreement is in conflict with the 1934 Polish-German Non-Aggression Pact is not true. In the future, if the United Kingdom concludes similar agreements with other countries, especially the Soviet Union and Romania, it only needs to avoid the general nature, that is, there is no meaning to form a group, and Poland will not have any objection. From this example, it can be seen that the above-mentioned treaties can actually be integrated with each other. Regarding the Soviet Union, London is conducting negotiations. Regarding Romania, it is more subtle, because the guarantee agreement previously signed between Romania and Poland (November 26, 1926) was aimed at the Soviet Union's aggression against Romania. Now Poland, because of its friendly relations with Hungary, is unwilling to extend it to the disputes that may arise between Hungary and Romania, nor is it willing to help Romania with Germany as the target. It may advise Hungary and Romania to establish temporary measures to eliminate the root cause. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) After the Anglo-Polish mutual assistance agreement was announced in principle, Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, is scheduled to return to Warsaw tomorrow. This afternoon, he held final talks with Foreign Secretary Halifax and also met with the Romanian Ambassador Tilea once. According to responsible officials here, the goal of the Anglo-Polish agreement is to resist German aggression, and when and how it will be implemented are also stipulated. Although the original text does not explicitly mention Germany, there is no doubt that it is mutually guaranteeing common response to German attacks. The guarantees given by Poland to the United Kingdom, that is, when the Netherlands, Switzerland, or France are attacked by Germany, when the United Kingdom intervenes, it is said that it can also be applied. After Foreign Minister Beck returns to the country to consult with the relevant authorities of the government, it can be formally signed. At that time, the British government will still conduct negotiations with Romania. Informed sources here also claimed that the United Kingdom intends to further conclude the same agreement with Greece and Turkey and provide unilateral guarantees to Hungary. The British government is said to have promised Foreign Minister Beck that when Polish Jews are emigrated, the British colonies will accept a portion of them. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>(London) Colonel Beck, the Polish Foreign Minister, met with French Ambassador Corbin this morning and informed him of the content of his talks with the British authorities.

<p>(Berlin) A semi-official source issued an important document this afternoon, warning Poland that if Poland does not withdraw from the German encirclement plan formulated by the United Kingdom, it will suffer the same fate as former Austria and former Czechoslovakia. Its words said, Germany, in order to establish stable and friendly relations with Poland, signed a non-aggression treaty with it on January 26, 1934. It can be seen that Germany has no intention of attacking Poland, nor does it intend to infringe on its territorial integrity. Poland is now resisting Germany, which is irrational and surprising. Looking at the recent developments in the situation, Poland has actually joined the German encirclement plan formulated by the United Kingdom. Knowing that the United Kingdom is a bad advisor, it often lures small countries into its clutches, thereby achieving imperialistic goals. There are many precedents in history. Now it is enticing Poland to join the "aggressive military alliance treaty" in order to harm Germany, and it obviously wants to incite war against Germany. If Poland signs this treaty, no matter what the consequences, it must bear part of the responsibility for the United Kingdom's policy of inciting war and aggression. Although Germany values peace, it cannot but be vigilant. Political figures here recently commented on this document, all attaching importance to the phrase "small countries fall into the clutches of the United Kingdom" and said that the lessons of Schuschnigg (former Austrian Prime Minister), Benes (former Czechoslovak Prime Minister), and other enemies of Germany are not far away. Polish Foreign Minister Beck should be vigilant. Foreign observers said that if Poland can withdraw from the United Kingdom's "aggressive anti-German policy" in time, it will not be attacked by Germany. It can be seen from the fact that the German and Italian military authorities are conducting talks and that the German side is only threatening Poland verbally. As for the warning issued by the Italian newspaper to Poland on the 3rd of this month, the German newspapers are happy to reprint it. The intention is to show Poland that the policy promoted by the Rome-Berlin Axis is more important than the friendly relations maintained by Italy and Poland. Italy may not be able to help Poland, which is no different from the fact that Italy maintained friendly relations with former Austria, but still failed to prevent the German-Austrian union. In addition, experienced observers believe that Germany has now clearly issued a warning, saying that it should adopt a wait-and-see attitude before the Anglo-Polish agreement is signed. If the attempt to encircle Germany is not abandoned, the European situation will face a major crisis in May this year. Some parties also said that Germany's intention is to force Poland to associate with it before Italy's tolerant attitude towards Germany's expansion policy changes. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<h3>Spain Joins Anti-Comintern Pact; Denies Italy is Increasing Troops</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Spain has recently joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) It has been rumored that Italy has recently sent army troops to land in Cadiz, southern Spain. Spanish Ambassador Lequerica visited Foreign Minister Bonnet and denied it. (Havas, 6th)</p>
<p>Burgos The Nationalist government has strongly denied the rumors that Italian troops have arrived in Cadiz again and said that after General Franco officially enters Madrid, the current Italian troops will also leave the country. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding Italy's recent dispatch of troops to Spain, the French Foreign Ministry has decided to question the Nationalist government, asking for its reasons for accepting them. It is said that the United Kingdom will also take the same steps. (Haitong, 7th)</p>
<h3>European Gold Still Mostly Transported to America</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Federal Reserve Board recently issued a statement, stating that gold from European countries continues to flow into the United States recently. In the past week alone, there was as much as US$130,000,000. This gold has mostly been sold to the US government and exchanged for US dollars, which were deposited in US banks. As a result, as of the 5th of this month, the funds stored in domestic banks totaled US$3,710,000,000, creating a new record. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Syrian-Iraqi Union Issue</h3>
<p>Beirut Regarding the proposal to unite Syria and Iraq into one country under the rule of the Hashemite royal family, former cabinet member Gholi submitted it to the parliament for discussion yesterday. Currently, anti-French sentiment is strong in various parts of Syria, so the proposal is very popular. The French High Commissioner to Syria, Puaux, left for home yesterday to report on his duties. It is believed that he will discuss the future status of Syria and the issue of Sanjak with the French government authorities. (Haitong, 7th)</p>

<h3>Before and After the Fall of Jiangmen: Four Days and Nights of Fighting, Heavy Casualties on Both Sides; Chinese Forces on the West River Maintain Original Positions</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Jiangmen, located in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, is a major commercial port in the West River tributary. Its water and land transportation are very convenient, its commerce is prosperous, and its population is large. After the fall of Guangzhou, the inevitable invasion of Jiangmen was expected. The circumstances before and after the fall of Jiangmen are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangmen Before the Fall</p>
<p>After Jiujiang and Sanshui were occupied by the Japanese army, Jiangmen lost contact with the upper reaches of the West River. Fortunately, the south bank of the West River was not ravaged by the Japanese army, so the upper reaches of Jiangmen could reach Zhaoqing via the damaged line of the Jianghe Highway and Yaoming Highway, and connect to Wuzhou. The lower reaches of Jiangmen could navigate through tributaries to Shiqi and Macau, and then reach Hong Kong. Most of the vegetables and fresh fruits needed daily in Hong Kong and Macau were supplied by Jiangmen. Imported goods needed in the upper reaches of the West River were also imported into the interior from Hong Kong and Macau via Jiangmen. In addition, most of the refugees from various places gathered here, so Jiangmen was more lively than before the war. At the same time, the daily food and all raw materials of the Japanese fleet and fishing boats along the coast of Zhongshan and Xinhui, although directly supplied by Macau, were actually indirectly supplied by Zhongshan and Xinhui. Because smugglers were rampant and the army's defense was not perfect, smugglers generally smuggled goods from Zhongshan and Xinhui to Macau, which was tantamount to supplying the Japanese army.</p>
<p>Situation Before the Fall</p>
<p>On March 27, the Japanese army captured Rongqi and Guizhou from Daliang. That night, many Japanese cavalry were found in the areas of Dongxi and Maning. Li Wuzi, the Jiangmen Garrison Commander, Zhou Hanling, the Deputy Commander, and Chi Zhongkuan, the Security Commander, immediately convened a meeting of senior military officers to discuss the defense plan. On the one hand, they transferred troops to strengthen the defense. On the other hand, they sent urgent telegrams to Zhang Fakui, the Commander of the War Zone, and Deng Longguang, the Commander-in-Chief of the West River, reporting the critical situation in Jiangmen and requesting that large forces be sent to support them. The next day, they sent police to persuade merchants to move their goods and evacuate the population from the city. All ferries were sealed off to load the evacuating people, and martial law was immediately declared throughout the city. From the 28th, all shops were closed. Refugees were either going to Taishan Sanbu or Shiqi and Macau, carrying the old and the young, and the situation was very embarrassing. That night, it was reported that more than 20 Japanese warships were gathered on the Yinggezu River, preparing to attack Jiangmen. The Japanese army in Jiujiang and Foshan also moved frequently. The Chinese army stepped up preparations for war. At dawn on the 29th, the Japanese army launched a large-scale attack on Beijie, Jiangmen, in three directions by land and water. Jiangmen was in a state of chaos that day, and it was rumored that Jiangmen had fallen at 2 pm on the 29th, but it was not true.</p>
<p>Defense of Jiangmen</p>
<p>On March 29, the Japanese army attacked Jiangmen in three directions. Its fleet went down the Yinggezu River, first occupied Zhutou Mountain, and rushed directly to the front of the Beijie Customs and the East Fort, firing fiercely. The army invaded Hetang and Chaolian from Dongxi and Maning, and another army moved out of Jiujiang and attacked Xiatang along Heshan Shaping. There were also 12 planes that flew back and forth to Beijie Jiangmen all day, bombing extensively. By 2 pm, the Chinese army's coastal positions and bunkers had been destroyed by artillery fire and bombs. Beijie was lost, and Jiangmen was in extreme danger. Deng Longguang happened to send two regiments of troops at this time, diverting from Heshan obliquely to Yugang, encircling and defeating the Japanese army in Xiatang, and killing more than 200 people. At the same time, the Japanese army in Chaolian, outside the sea, was also shelled by the Chinese army and could not cross the river. The Japanese army on the front of Beijie was blocked in Shuinan. None of the three Japanese armies succeeded, and the losses were huge. On the 30th, the Japanese army increased two regiments of naval and land forces and more than 20 aircraft from Xiaohuangpu near Humen and rushed to land in Baishi, Baisha, Hetang, Hengjiang, and Sanjiang. Under the fierce attack of the Japanese army by sea, land, and air, the Chinese army fought until the 31st and moved its position to the Shuinan Hougang Fanluogang area, confronting the Japanese army. The Japanese army forced harder and harder. Its shallow water fleet forced to Dixi Road in Jiangmen to fire, and the two armies engaged in street fighting. That night, the Chinese army had to withdraw from Jiangmen and moved to the highlands of Gangzhou Road. Until 8 am on April 1, Jiangmen was completely lost. From the 29th to April 1, there were four days and nights of fierce fighting. The casualties on both sides reached more than a thousand people. More than a hundred civilians were killed or injured by stray bullets. Most of the prosperous streets were destroyed by aircraft bombing. Dilapidated walls and broken tiles were unsightly.</p>
<p>Two Armies Hold Each Other at Huicheng</p>
<p>The Chinese army guarding the factory gate, after retreating to Huicheng, set up new positions on the highlands of Xiangshan and Guigang Mountain outside the city. The advance was distributed in Daze, Lile, and Siqian on both sides of Gangzhou Highway. Teams were mobilized to fight. One day in the evening, the Japanese army attacked Huicheng without success. On the morning of the 2nd, the Japanese army sent a large team to advance and sent aircraft to bomb Huicheng, Daze, Siqian, Lile, and Fenshui River. The sound of gunfire was endless. The Xinhui County Government and various agencies moved to Danshuikou to work temporarily one day before the fall of Jiangmen. Most of the shops in the Shizimen Zhongshan Road area in Huicheng were bombed by Japanese aircraft bombs and artillery shells. There were four or five fires burning in the city, and the order was extremely chaotic.</p>
<p>Shiqi Stepped up Martial Law</p>
<p>After the fall of Ronggui, Zhang Huichang, the Magistrate of Zhongshan County, returned to Zhongshan County from Hong Kong and began to deploy defenses. On the 28th, he first destroyed the Qiguan Highway and sent troops to defend the Xiaolan, Guzhen, and Niushiwan areas, prohibiting ships and vehicles from coming and going. But as of the 3rd, there was no harassment by the Japanese army in Xiaolan Guzhen.</p>
<p>Traitors in Xinshun Actively</p>
<p>In addition to the land, sea, and air forces, the Japanese army that invaded Ronggui Jiangmen this time also included the pseudo-self-defense army and pseudo-worker-peasant army organized by Li Daoxuan, the pseudo-magistrate of Nanhai County, Guangzhou, and Liang Yongsang, the pseudo-maintenance committee member. Li and Liang were responsible for commanding and guiding. Therefore, they could detour from small roads or infiltrate from the tributaries of the port and river, using small steamers to cover canvas boats to attack. However, because the ports and rivers were divergent and the defense area was vast, the Chinese army's defense was extremely weak and could not prevent everywhere, so it was copied by the Japanese army. Li and Liang and other puppets arrived in Jiangmen on the 1st and summoned Chen and Zhao, the local tyrants there, to discuss organizing a pseudo-county government. It is said that Chen Kouyang will be appointed as the pseudo-county magistrate.</p>
<p>Dynamics in the Upper Reaches of the West River</p>
<p>When the Japanese army in Guangzhou, Foshan, Jiujiang, and other places dispatched troops to attack Jiangmen, the Japanese army in Hekou, Sanshui, pretended to attack in an attempt to contain the Chinese army in the West River. The Japanese artillery fired shells at the Jinli Chinese army in Ximakou on the 29th and 30th. The Japanese army in the old Sanshui fired shells across the river at Lubao Mafang frequently and sent several planes to reconnoiter Guangli, Houli, Zhaoqing, Baitu Gaoming, and other places all day. In addition to strict defense, the Chinese army sent a certain unit of the Guangxi army to open into Xinhui from Gaohe to rescue. Outsiders said that the Guangxi army had opened to Jiangmen to help in the battle, which was probably this.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Pseudo-Governor Encountered Danger in His Hometown; Disturbances Occurred Again in the City</h3>
<p>Wuxi Correspondence: Qin Lianggong, the pseudo-governor, went to various villages in accordance with the wishes of the Japanese special task force, so-called to appease the villagers, in order to reduce resistance. Qin knew that guerrillas were densely deployed in various villages and could not refuse. The other day, he went to Meicun, Qinbo, Nanyan, and Dangkou villages and towns with Gu Hanping, the pseudo-civil affairs section chief, Sakamoto, the Japanese team leader, Ercun Rang, the Japanese special task force leader, and a squad of Japanese soldiers. Japanese troops were stationed in Dangkou. Hua Ziwei, the pseudo-village elder, set up a reception center in the salt shop. Qin and the Japanese team leader stayed in Hua's house overnight. Unexpectedly, under this strict protection, when Qin returned to the city, he was suddenly attacked by eight warriors in a certain place. Because the target was not accurate, their ambitions were not fulfilled. Qin was only frightened.</p>
<p>The Japanese gasoline depot on Dexin Bridge, Ximen, Wuxi, suddenly caught fire the other day, causing considerable losses. At the same time, near Baer Lane in the city, pseudo-detective Chen Shiyuan was shot and injured. As a result, the Japanese and puppets closed the city gates tightly, cut off traffic in all places, and searched door-to-door by the Japanese military police and pseudo-police, but found nothing. The residents of the city were like birds in a cage, and they were manipulated by them. Those with a little surplus money were fleeing to Shanghai. The city gates were closed for three days before they were allowed to open.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, Recently I read the news in your newspaper's Dinghai Correspondence that Zhao Cai gathered bandits and harassed Putuo Wulushan and other places. After reading it, I was extremely horrified. I secretly thought that Zhao Cai's restraint of his subordinates has always been strict. Since being ordered to take on guerrilla work, he has dared not disturb the people. The report is completely unfounded. I hope you will give a correction. This is specially communicated, and I respectfully request you to write Qi. Sincerely, Jiangzhe Border Area Guerrilla Column 17th Detachment Captain Pan Zhao Cai, April 5.</p>
<h3>The Japanese Army Attempts to Invade Chao-Shan, Intercepting Vessels for Their Use</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Swatow states that after Hua Zhenzhong took office as the Chao-Shan Garrison Commander, he actively organized soldiers and civilians, evacuated the elderly, weak, women, and children, and intensified the consolidation of coastal defense works. All teams in Swatow have been conducting combat exercises and live ammunition shooting in the suburbs for sixty consecutive days since March 30th. Starting from that day, all fishing boats and sailboats were strictly prohibited from sailing out of Mayu Port. The traffic between Nan'ao and Chao-Shan is currently completely cut off. Two Japanese warships are anchored between Liaohai North and South Ports and Nan'ao. The Japanese warships dispatch armed motorboats daily to pursue and capture overseas fishing boats and cargo ships. More than one hundred sailing vessels and fishing boats from Chenghai North and South Ports, Swatow Mayu, and Chaoyang Dahao have been captured. Some were set on fire, some boatmen were shot and killed, and some drowned while jumping into the water to escape. The captured fishing boats are lined up under the mountains of Nan'ao. Furthermore, the Japanese warships are collecting vessels, seemingly with some intention towards the Chao-Shan coast. In Nan'ao County, due to Hua and Zhu's defenses, the Japanese army has landed five times this month. Each time they land, the people are startled and flee into the mountains. A police chief, Mr. Chen, and a Bao chief, Mr. Zhang, were killed because they could not escape in time. Recently, Nan'ao has completely fallen into the hands of the Japanese army. The day before yesterday, Dahao, which belongs to Chaoyang County, suddenly had a false alarm because a Japanese speedboat carrying more than ten armed Japanese soldiers sped to the river ferry and landed. The Japanese soldiers scouted along the coast and surveyed maps. They left in a moment. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese army has indeed been probing Chao-Shan recently.</p>

<h3>Discussing Methods to Prevent Flooding in Northern Jiangsu After the Breaching of the Yellow River at Huayuankou and Zhaokou</h3>
<p>— (Fei Zhujun, Dongtai) (Continued from the newspaper this month on the 6th)</p>
<p>The Yellow River varies in width, and the course of the Jialu River often shifts. Between Zheng County and Kaifeng, the river flows are sometimes open and sometimes blocked, and the embankments are sometimes destroyed and sometimes rebuilt. This is common and not surprising. If the central government can pay attention to blocking the breach, they can select a higher location in the Xinghuaying and Baisha Towns area, where the overflow from Huayuankou and Zhaokou converge, to build an embankment. Although it is tens of miles away from the north bank, the wide river channel is not impossible. Alternatively, they can block the capping project built last August and strengthen and thicken the capping embankment to act as a canal for the river. This may also be possible. These are all methods to struggle to block the breach.</p>
<p>V. Handling Other Projects Without Blocking the Breach</p>
<p>If the breach is not blocked, but one wants to prevent floods in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in northern Jiangsu, in my opinion, there are "urgent" and "delayed" projects. There are four "urgent projects":</p>
<p>(A) Expanding the New Zhongshan River. The method of expansion is to follow the old embankment, measure the terrain north and south, and choose the side with a slightly smaller project to double the width and build a new embankment. Alternatively, the riverbed can be completely excavated, or according to the inverse fall method of Mr. Xian's plan, a fall pond can be dug every ten miles, ten zhang long, seventy zhang wide, and about two to three zhang deep. The Yangzhuang River near the river is twice as wide as the Haikou River, so that the water flow can surge and expand on its own.</p>
<p>(B) Restoring the Old Diversion Rivers. There are eight old diversion rivers from Honghu to Huaiyin: Zhangfu River, Peijia Chang, Zhangjiazhuang, Lan Niqian, Sancha River, Tianran, Tianci, and Taiping. Currently, except for Zhangfu River, which is open, all are silted up. For the sake of discharging huge amounts of water, it is necessary to separately excavate each diversion river.</p>
<p>(C) Blocking the Sanhe Jiangba. Currently, 80-90% of the Honghu water flows into Gaobao Lake through Jiangba, and 10-20% flows into the New Zhongshan River through Zhangfu River. When the Honghu water rises, the discharge from Jiangba into Gaobao Lake into the Yangtze River is insufficient. If the eastern canal embankment is not opened early, it will inevitably collapse, and the counties downstream will be submerged. This is known to all insightful people. The way to prevent this is to block Jiangba, so that all the vast water can be discharged through the diversion rivers to the north.</p>
<p>Historically, lake waters have generally flowed northward. Since the Yellow River passes through Huaiyin, the riverbed has been elevated, and it is not easy to discharge the Huai River. In the first year of Kangxi, the people of Xusi secretly opened eight small canals north and south of Gu Gouzhen and Gujiaqiao, and the water began to be largely diverted to the lakes of Gaomai. For this reason, Jin Wenxiang built five dams in the southeast of the lake to discharge water. This was a measure of expediency, and the dams moved to the north. Previous scholars have repeatedly suggested blocking Jiangba. Now, with the turbulent Yellow River flowing into Honghu, without a corresponding tailwater, it will easily collapse and cause disaster. The narrow canal cannot smoothly flow into the river, and the single eastern embankment cannot withstand the force of the downstream rush. To prevent this disaster, even with great effort, Jiangba must be blocked.</p>
<p>(D) Raising the Gaoyan and Other Embankments. If Jiangba is not blocked, the canals and dams are easily opened, and the counties downstream are easily flooded. If Jiangba is to be blocked, the Honghu water will be abundant, and if the discharge is insufficient, there is a risk of overflow and collapse. Therefore, raising and consolidating the Hong embankment is also a necessary project for disaster prevention.</p>
<p>In summary, urgent projects should be implemented decisively. To seek rapid discharge, first expand the New Zhongshan River, and then diversion rivers can be opened. To consider the vastness of the water, first open up diversion rivers, and then Jiangba can be blocked. To prevent the collapse of the water, first block Jiangba, and then raise the Hong embankment. These are interconnected and urgent projects that cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>There are also four delayed projects:</p>
<p>(A) Excavating the Liu'an Haozhuling. The Huai River originally had the water of seventy-two mountain rivers. If the vast Yellow River is added, it will flow through Henan Zhuxianzhen Zhoujiakou to Anhui Zhengyangguan and converge. Going north to Fengtai, it first encounters the Xia Stone, then the Black Mountain Stone, and then, narrowing to Huaiyuan, it is again strangled by mountains such as Jintu. In June of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the National Government Relief Committee for Flood Disasters was established in Fengtai, Huaiyuan, Lingbi, Fengyang, Wuhe, and Xuyi counties, extending the Huai embankment by hundreds of kilometers. The Zhengyangguan area has already constrained the downstream water, and it will inevitably feel that the upstream surge is difficult to discharge. This is not only a disaster for the blockage of Yu and Anhui, but also a long-term harm to northern Jiangsu. The only way to provide relief is to divert it. Haozhuling in Liu'an is the watershed between the Yangtze and Huai Rivers, connecting the Huai River to the northwest and the Yangtze River to the southeast. If a mountain depression can be selected and excavated to pass through, this is the way to divert the water from Zhengyangguan into the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>(B) Connecting the Shouxian Hefei Waterways. The southern branch of the Wabu Lake in Shouxian is separated from the Fei River and Pai River in Hefei by mountain roads, which are not very far apart. If it can be excavated and connected, it is also a diversion into the Yangtze River. Excavating Haozhuling is a way to reduce the source of the water.</p>
<p>(C) Connecting the Xuyi Liuhe Waterways. It is natural for water to overflow when it is full. It is difficult to discharge all the waters gathered in the Hongtan area, which is more than 700 miles in circumference, through one outlet. Zhang Pengge, a river official in the Qing Dynasty, planned to excavate mountains and open roads at Liuhuaitao and other places in Xuyi, and divert the Huai River into the Yangtze River through Liuhe. If this plan can be followed, it is a good way to slowly reduce the surge of Honghu.</p>
<p>(D) Restoring the Siyang Sanyikou Waterway. It was found that Siyang Sanyikou was silted up during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty. If it can be excavated at this time and the original river channel restored, allowing the lake water to enter the canal and be divided into the sea through the Liutang Irrigation River, this is also intended to slowly reduce the surge of floods.</p>
<p>The above delayed projects are methods to reduce the source and open up more paths. It is necessary to consider the local situation, handle them sooner or later, hold them partially, or temporarily stop them, act according to the situation, wait for the time to act, and all are appropriate.</p>
<p>VI. Conclusion</p>
<p>When I describe the blocking of Huayuankou and Zhaokou and our method, and the interests of the counties in the lower reaches of the Yellow River in northern Jiangsu, I cannot help but feel my poverty. In general, there is no perfect benefit in the world, and the plan to quench thirst by drinking poison is ultimately not as good as removing the firewood from under the cauldron. If the counties downstream want to avoid Yellow River disasters, they must block the breach. The efforts to find solutions and seek results will certainly not be a simple project that can be completed. It will certainly be more difficult than blocking the Yellow Mouth. This is the opinion of a fool, and I hope that insightful people will correct it.</p>

<h3>The Two Ambassadors Have Finished Their Talks; Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen Heads to Chongqing; Sir Craigie Delays His Return for One or Two Days; French Ambassador Cosme Arrives in Shanghai This Afternoon</h3>
<p>After the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, arrived in Shanghai, he held talks with the Ambassador to China, Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen, for several days, which have largely come to an end. Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen is scheduled to leave Shanghai today for Hong Kong and then Chongqing, while Sir Craigie will wait to meet with the French Ambassador Cosme before heading to Japan to resume his post. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Lengthy Talks Between the Two Ambassadors</p>
<p>After Sir Craigie arrived in Shanghai from Japan, in addition to meeting with leading British gentlemen and businessmen and attending Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen's banquet, he declined other diplomatic receptions. Most of his time was spent in lengthy talks with the British Ambassador to China, Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen. Yesterday afternoon, Sir Craigie continued to discuss matters with Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen, British Consul-General Philip, and others at Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen's residence on Dunxin Road. Diplomatic circles believe that these talks are of considerable importance, are clearly related to British foreign policy in the Far East, and believe that after days of secret talks, there should be a satisfactory outcome.</p>
<p>Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen Heads to Hong Kong Today</p>
<p>The British Ambassador to China, Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen, is scheduled to leave Shanghai by British warship today for Hong Kong, and then to Chongqing, where he will have important contacts with the National Government's foreign affairs authorities. He will be staying for several days, so it is difficult to predict when he will be able to return to Shanghai. The British Consul-General and the British Chamber of Commerce held a farewell dinner for Sir Knatchbull-Hugessen last night. As for the Ambassador to Japan, Sir Craigie, who was originally scheduled to return to his post today, he will extend his stay in Shanghai and delay his departure eastward by one or two days because he now needs to meet with the French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, to exchange diplomatic views.</p>
<p>Mr. Cosme Arrives in Shanghai Today</p>
<p>The French Ambassador to China, Mr. Cosme, originally planned to come to Shanghai by ship from Hong Kong last week after presenting his credentials to the National Government in Chongqing and meeting with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. However, he was delayed by a ship collision and only changed to the French gunboat "D'Entrecasteaux" on the 6th to come north. It is expected that the journey will arrive at Wusongkou around 2:00 pm today. At that time, he will land at the Taikoo Wharf. The French garrison and police in Shanghai have decided to be on guard at the wharf to protect him and arrange armed troops to express their welcome. Leading French businessmen in the port are preparing a grand welcome and welcoming party for the French Ambassador.</p>
<h3>With Clear Weather and Increased Arrivals, Rice Prices Are Gradually Falling Back; Japanese Merchants Collect and Transport Rice and Wheat for Export; The Total Amount Reaches Approximately One Million Bags</h3>
<p>Japanese merchants Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yoshida, and other three companies have recently gone to various production areas in the interior to collect and transport rice, wheat, and other goods, smuggling them through various ports in North and South China, evading taxes. The total amount is scheduled to be one million bags, which will soon be sufficient. The source of rice and grain in Shanghai has increased due to clear weather and increased arrivals, and rice prices have gradually returned to normal. The Modern News Agency reporter has investigated and reported the details as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Merchants Collect Rice and Wheat in Production Areas</p>
<p>Since the three Japanese companies Mitsui, Mitsubishi, and Yoshida in Shanghai began collecting and transporting rice and wheat for export in the agricultural areas of various counties along the river, after close attention from all parties, the treacherous merchants who rely on the Japanese have become more cautious and dare not openly trade. Therefore, the number of exports has decreased. According to the Modern News Agency reporter, the said Mitsui and other companies have recently organized a × Ji foreign company with a small number of dishonest rice brokers, using the name of × merchants, to order large quantities of rice and wheat from Shanghai and the production areas in the interior. After loading them in Hongkou, they are then loaded onto Japanese ships to be transported to Dalian, Tianjin, Yantai, Xiamen, Guangdong, and other Japanese-occupied ports for sale while evading taxes. Many rice shops in the southern gang have been deceived and are trading with the said foreign company. The Bean Rice Industry Guild is currently investigating this matter and will punish it once it is verified.</p>
<p>The Total Amount of One Million Bags Will Soon Be Sufficient</p>
<p>The total amount of grain collected by Japanese merchants Mitsui, Mitsubishi, Yoshida, and other three companies in China is scheduled to be 600,000 bags of rice and 400,000 bags of wheat. Since the active purchase, in addition to all the wheat being shipped out, more than 400,000 bags of rice have been shipped out one after another, with more than 100,000 bags still missing. They are still continuing to collect and will soon be able to ship them out.</p>
<p>The Source of Rice and Grain in Shanghai Has Increased</p>
<p>With clear weather in recent days, 5-6,000 bags of rice and grain transported to Shanghai by land and inland river transport are counted every day, but very few are transported to Shanghai by Yangtze River ships due to high freight rates. The number of transactions in the market is about 10,000 bags per day. Because there is sufficient rice stored in Shanghai and the number of arrivals is increasing every day, people's minds are at ease and prices are gradually stabilizing. Except for No. 1 rice, which is still maintaining the status quo, the middle and best quality rice have successively fallen back to within the price limit.</p>
<h3>The Market Transactions of Rice and Grain Are Shipped Early; The Guild Corrects the Delay in Shipment, in Order to Maintain the Rights and Interests of the Vendors</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Bean Rice Industry Guild has issued a notice in order to correct the credit of the industry and ship the rice and grain traded in the market early, stating that in recent rice and grain transactions, there are still delays in shipment, even exceeding ten days, or even half a month or a month. Moreover, the goods traded on the same day often use the excuse that the sample does not match, and notify the cancellation of the ticket by telephone at six or seven or even nine or ten o'clock in the evening. This situation not only hinders the rights and interests of the vendors, but also damages the reputation of the industry, and it is necessary to correct it. The executive and supervisory committees of the guild have decided that the buying and selling of rice and grain by the industry should be paid in cash during this extraordinary period. If the shipment procedures are not completed in time, the limit is ten days at the latest. Those with warehouse receipts shall pay 80% of the price within the period, and those without warehouse receipts shall be weighed and settled by the buyer upon expiration. All responsibilities shall be borne by the seller within ten days in accordance with the previous regulations, and by the buyer outside ten days. The previous proposal is reiterated and announced to the market, and it must be strictly followed.

<h3>Bandits and Puppets Rampant in the Sections Where Roads Are Built Beyond the Concessions; The Safety of Various Factories; It Is Proposed to Ask the Concession Authorities to Find Ways to Protect Them; It Is Also Decided to Hire More Patrolmen to Prevent and Guard</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Shanghai War and the retreat of the National Army, in the factories in the fallen areas such as Nanshi and Zhabei, except for a number of important industries that were seized by the Japanese or destroyed by artillery fire, the smaller factories have tried to move into the concessions and resume operations. The authorities of the two concessions have designated the western district of the Public Concession and the roads built beyond the boundaries as factory areas in order to facilitate the continued operation of various vegetable factories. The French Concession has approved the construction of factory buildings on the relatively quiet roads connecting Nanshi and Caojing districts for more than a year, and the number of factories has gradually increased, and the market is also called prosperous. Recently, factories in the area of ​​the roads built beyond the boundary in the western part of Shanghai have been frequently blackmailed by personnel of the Japanese and puppet "institutions", or bandits have been appearing to search and loot, and they have been harmed a lot. Every night, it becomes a world of haze, not only can they not work safely, but even encounter unfortunate events. Therefore, in order to ensure safety, the manufacturers in the area have gathered several times to discuss and will jointly ask the Public Works Bureau to give protection, and hire more patrolmen to be responsible for guarding and preventing them.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Telegram Reports Peace; Japanese Warships Inspect Foreign Ships; Three Japanese Warships Are Anchored Off Dinghai; Foreign Ships To And From Shanghai And Wenzhou Are Often Illegally Inspected</h3>
<p>After Zhenhai Port was declared closed from 22:00 on the afternoon of the 5th, Zhejiang people in Shanghai were deeply concerned about the situation in Ningbo. Yesterday, the shipping industry received a telegram from Ningbo, saying that the local area was peaceful and everything was as usual. It is rumored that various shipping companies plan to resume shipping and intend to use boats to barge goods outside the blockade line. Shipping companies believe that the facts are difficult. Three Japanese warships are anchored off Dinghai, inspecting foreign ships coming and going. The German merchant ship Feikang was shot at. The details are as follows from the Modern News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Ningbo Telegram Reports That the Local Area Is Peaceful</p>
<p>Since Zhenhai Port was declared closed from 3:00 pm on the 5th, prohibiting any ships from entering or leaving, traffic between Shanghai and Ningbo has been completely cut off. The general public in Shanghai, Zhejiang, is quite concerned about the situation in Ningbo after the closure of the port. People often call the Ningbo Association and various shipping companies to inquire. In fact, they are all overly nervous. This closure is purely to enhance defense. In terms of transportation, it is certainly inconvenient, but the situation in Ningbo has obviously become more peaceful. Yesterday, a certain shipping company in the city received a telegram from the Ningbo branch saying, (above omitted) "Ningbo is as peaceful as ever, shops are open as usual, people's hearts are very stable, Taiping ship is still anchored in its original place, and the saying that it is ready to be sunk is groundless," etc. The above telegram further proves that Ningbo is peaceful and safe.</p>
<p>Shipping Companies Have Not Planned to Resume Shipping</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that foreign shipping companies, in view of the fact that Haimen and Ningbo have been closed, in order to maintain shipping, various ships are anchored outside Zhenhaikou, Jiaojiang, and Oujiangkou, and goods are transported by small boats to and from ports. The Modern News Agency reporter inquired about this matter from the persons in charge of the shipping industry. It is learned that this news is not true. The shipping companies have no plans to adopt the method reported and resume the voyage between Zhenhai and Haimen. The Sanjiangkou of Haimen has no pier facilities and is very inconvenient for mooring, and the transportation of goods by small boats is even more dangerous. The situation in Zhenhai Port is similar, so in fact, it is impossible to resume shipping before it is opened. As for the saying that Wenzhou Port will also be closed, the shipping companies have not heard of it, so the ships are still sailing as usual and have not been obstructed.</p>
<p>Japanese Warships Search Foreign Ships Coming and Going</p>
<p>Recently, Japanese warships have been inspecting merchant ships moored off Dinghai on Zhoushan Island. The German merchant ship Feikang of the Lu Lin Foreign Company in Shanghai sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou on the morning of the 6th. When passing Dinghai at 4:00 pm, it had already passed the location where the Japanese warships were moored. The Japanese warships suddenly fired shots at the ship, a total of three shots. Fortunately, it was not damaged, and the ship continued to sail to Wenzhou. At the same time, the German captain telegraphed the Shanghai headquarters, requesting that it be reported to the German Consulate immediately and a protest be filed. It is reported that the ship arrived in Wenzhou yesterday afternoon. According to another news, yesterday (6th) afternoon, the Tangbei ship of the US merchant Huamei Company's Shanghai-Wenzhou line, which was traveling from Shanghai to Ou, the Hailong ship of the Portuguese merchant Atlantic Company, which was traveling from Wenzhou to Shanghai, and the Libao ship of the French merchant Lu Lin Foreign Company (which was traveling on the Yongding line), encountered several Japanese warships in the Zhoushan waters and were stopped for search. The Huamei and Atlantic companies in Shanghai did not hear any news of their release yesterday, so they telegraphed to inquire. However, the telegraph calls sent out at 6:00 pm did not respond, so the truth is unknown. The Baoli ship has no radio equipment, so it is even more isolated.</p>

<h3>Attack on Japanese Military Vehicle Near Nanxiang; Shanghai County Organizes People's Self-Defense Force; Over 3,000 Recruits; Truth of Bloody Battle in Chengsi Village Near Jinze</h3>
<p>Six Japanese military vehicles departed Zhabei last night (the 6th) to reinforce Nanjing. In addition to over a hundred Japanese soldiers, the vehicles carried military provisions. When the vehicles reached the vicinity of Nanxiang, they were suddenly attacked by guerrillas ambushing the railway line. Hand grenades were hurled at the train cars. Caught off guard, the Japanese soldiers panicked and jumped off to resist. However, due to the late hour, the Japanese soldiers were fearful and dared not advance. The guerrillas seized the opportunity to escape. Dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed or wounded in the engagement. The remaining troops continued to Nanjing in the original vehicles.</p>
<p>Shanghai County Forms Self-Defense Force</p>
<p>Since the reorganization of the Shanghai County administrative organs by the provincial government, the Party and government leaders have led their cadres deep behind Japanese lines to lead the people in national salvation work, rectify local organizations, and strengthen local military forces.

They are currently undergoing intensive training in [omitted] to become an elite force to support the regular army in sweeping away the Japanese invaders.</p>
<p>Bloody Battle Results Near Jinze</p>
<p>A villager from Qingpu who witnessed the battle in Shanghai described in detail the fierce fighting between a certain regiment of the Chinese mobile forces and the Japanese-puppet forces in the Chengsi Village area near Jinze on March 28th. The following is a summary: After being repelled by the regiment at Xitang Town in Jiashan County on March 25th, the Japanese-puppet forces returned the next day with 400 puppet troops and 300 Japanese soldiers, traveling on dozens of motorboats from Xitang to Luxu, intending to eliminate the regiment. However, the regimental commander had already received intelligence and prepared a strong defense, awaiting a fierce strike. They encountered each other in Chengsi Village on the 28th. At noon that afternoon, the enemy, with the puppet troops as the vanguard and Japanese officers in command, launched a fierce attack on the village in multiple directions, covered by steel cannons and dense machine gun fire. The regimental commander supervised his troops and calmly engaged the enemy. The soldiers also bravely charged and fought. Although the fortifications were completely destroyed by enemy fire, the positions remained unmoved. Fighting continued until 7 PM when the enemy received reinforcements. The regimental commander, for strategic reasons, ordered the abandonment of the stronghold, with Sun Su in charge of covering the retreat. Sun Lian, along with one adjutant and dozens of soldiers, heroically sacrificed themselves. A machine gunner, a brave warrior, continued to fire fiercely even after both legs were blown off by enemy artillery shells, tightly gripping the machine gun with both hands until his ammunition was exhausted and he died with a smile. Although our losses that day were significant, the enemy's losses were several times greater. The 400 puppet troops, under the duress of the Japanese, were annihilated by our forces when they advanced and were strafed by Japanese machine guns when they retreated, resulting in nearly 300 casualties. The Japanese lost one commanding officer and over a hundred soldiers. It is now reported that the regiment has gathered its forces and will join a certain division of the regular army that has crossed the river to attack [omitted].</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Forced Back in Liuhe and Luodian</p>
<p>A guerrilla force of over 300 men attacked the edge of the Baoshan County city walls a few days ago and engaged the Japanese army. When the Japanese army sent large reinforcements, the guerrillas safely withdrew. Furthermore, Liuhe and Luodian are now controlled by guerrillas, and the Japanese army has been suppressed.</p>
<h3>Plot to Control Fengnan, Nanhui, and Chuansha Counties; Japanese-Puppet Forces Attack Pudong in Vain; Fierce Fighting Occurs Daily in Various Locations in Pudong; Company Deputy Commander Shi Sacrifices His Life Bravely Fighting the Enemy</h3>
<p>The situation in Pudong has suddenly become tense in recent days. The people of the area are relocating en masse. Those with some financial means are going to Shanghai, while the general poor farmers are also moving to safer areas. This is because the Japanese-puppet forces have been constantly harassing the Pudong area, indiscriminately killing civilians, and burning farmers' homes. Xu [omitted] Fa, the "Pudong Franco" of the Pudong puppet army since Zhang Miaogen turned traitor, has been replaced by Zhang Miaogen. The Japanese also call him "Commander-in-Chief Zhang." On the morning of March 28th, Zhang Miaogen and Xu Hongfa, together with the Japanese army, launched a three-pronged attack on Pudong, attempting to isolate the three counties of Fengnan, Nanhui, and Chuansha. One route advanced from Chenxing Bridge, another landed from warships at Tangkou, and the third landed from Sujia Bridge. Pudong is the defense zone of Fan Gencai. Fan's troops are strong and well-organized, and many of his subordinates are capable young cadres. The Japanese-puppet forces' attack on Pudong was reported to General Commander Fan's headquarters early on, and his troops jointly resisted. After more than an hour of fierce fighting, the Japanese-puppet forces were defeated and retreated in disarray. Fan's troops took advantage of the victory to pursue them as far as the Sanlintang border. In this battle, three puppet soldiers from Zhang's troops were killed, two were captured, and one puppet flag and one Japanese flag were seized, along with more than ten rifles. Seeing that Fan's forces were strong and not easy to attack, the Japanese attempted to use a political conspiracy that did not cost a single bullet to disintegrate Fan's troops. That night, they sent puppet company commander Gu Muxiang as a negotiator, attempting to lure and coerce Fan's troops to split. As a result, puppet company commander Gu Muxiang was detained and beheaded the next morning as a warning to others. The people were delighted and cheered. On the morning of March 29th, the Japanese-puppet forces, seeking revenge, launched a large-scale attack on Pudong from Zhoupu, Zhaolou, and Tangkou, forcibly conscripting civilians along the way and forcing them to act as guides. However, the surrounding troops had already dispersed and the Japanese-puppet forces marched in vain, gaining nothing. In anger, they destroyed more than ten civilian houses in Fanjiagang. On the afternoon of the 29th, the Japanese-puppet forces attacked Tangkou again, resulting in an engagement. At that time, Company Deputy Commander Shi Caiming took the lead, bravely standing at the front line, holding a light machine gun with both hands, inflicting a deadly blow on the enemy. More than ten Japanese-puppet soldiers were killed on the spot. Ultimately, due to being outnumbered and lacking rear support, Company Deputy Commander Shi heroically sacrificed his life. On March 30th, April 1st, and April 2nd, the Japanese-puppet forces continuously harassed Pudong, aiming to test the situation and prepare for an invasion. Japanese-puppet troops are stationed in Zhao [omitted], Hangtou, Sanlin, and Zhoupu, and military vehicles are constantly passing on the Shangnan Road. It is expected that there will be fierce fighting in Pudong within a week.</p>

In addition to reporting on the attendance process, they will also discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Indian Missionary Tours Southwest, Praises China's Progress; New Life Flourishing in West China; Young People Undergoing Military Training Visible Everywhere</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, Reverend Mendul of Asanol, India, who has extensively toured the western provinces, arrived in Shanghai last week. Yesterday (the 4th), he told reporters that the Japanese attempt to discourage "free China" with cruel bombing has failed miserably. Japanese bombers fly to destroy homes, cultural, and educational institutions, but new buildings and institutions have emerged from the ashes. The survivors are continuing their work as usual. Reverend Mendul condemned the "indiscriminate" Japanese air raids.</p>
<p>Citing Wells</p>
<p>He said, "Superman created the airplane, but it was seized by an ape." Reverend Mendul came to China with Reverend Hang Kin of Yangon as part of a goodwill delegation after the closing of the Madras International Missionary Conference. They toured Chongqing. According to Reverend Mendul, the outside world may think that Chongqing is a backward city, but he sees Chongqing as a beautiful metropolis surrounded by water on two sides. The population of Chongqing has jumped from 400,000 before the war to 800,000 at present, and is still increasing rapidly. Signs of "wartime China" are visible everywhere in the city. Most houses have air-raid shelters and basements. Today in</p>
<p>Chongqing's Homes</p>
<p>An air-raid shelter is as indispensable as a living room. These two Indian and Burmese visitors were deeply impressed by the massive construction projects underway in the Chinese interior. Reverend Mendul further stated that thanks to the war, new life has been able to flourish in West China. The progress in that area had previously lagged behind and was difficult to reach, but now it is filled with new life. Tens of thousands of hands and feet are working hard. A vigorous and revitalized new China is being built rapidly. Many institutions and industries have been moved from the guerrilla zones to these mountainous and dangerous areas. Although the people have suffered hardship and lost their homes, their spirits have not been broken. We saw</p>
<p>Their Courage and Determination</p>
<p>And deeply admired their spirit to resist until the end. Reverend Mendul went on to criticize China's military preparations, and described the situation of newly recruited soldiers that he and his group saw while staying overnight in Xifang (transliteration) on their way from Myanmar to Kunming via the new international highway. Xifang is more than 600 miles from Kunming and only 25 miles from the Chinese border with Myanmar. The morning after they arrived in the city, at dawn, they saw hundreds and thousands of strong men, many of them teenagers,</p>
<p>Training in Front of the County Government</p>
<p>Commanded by officers of the Chinese regular army. They traveled west to Kunming, and then toured Sichuan. They saw this situation everywhere. Tens of thousands of men are currently receiving regular training, preparing to go to the front lines to fight in the future. Reverend Mendul and his group of seven, including one woman, traveled by car from Myanmar to Kunming. He said that this trip, traveling on mountain roads for days, was deeply exciting. The distance from Yangon to Kunming is approximately 1,350 miles, roughly half in Myanmar and half in China. Thousands of workers are still working on the road, building new bridges, correcting many turns,</p>
<p>And Widening the Road Surface</p>
<p>Although the workers are working with primitive methods, the efficiency of their work impressed him deeply. About halfway from the Myanmar border, they drove to a height of 9,500 feet above sea level, then descended through winding roads into the rich basin of Yunnan, finally with the beautiful Lake Kunming in sight. After spending a week in Kunming, they went to Chengdu and Chongqing.</p>
<p>This Tour of West China</p>
<p>Lasted more than two months. The Japanese are now working hard to carry out propaganda in India and Myanmar, but the people of India and Myanmar deeply sympathize with China. Both Reverend Mendul and Reverend Hang are convinced that the Chinese people now have this heroic spirit and that the final victory of the war will undoubtedly belong to China. The army of justice may suffer temporary setbacks, and the army of brutality may win for a time, but in the final battle, justice will ultimately triumph over violence, etc. Reverend Mendul and Reverend Hang are scheduled to return home today (the 5th) via Hong Kong on the Italian steamer Conte Verde.</p>

The promoters of the mill believe that corporate enterprises should be based on the interests of the public, and the fundraising of shares should be universalized. Therefore, out of the fixed capital of 500,000 yuan, in addition to the 350,000 yuan that has already been fully subscribed for by themselves, 150,000 yuan, or 3,000 shares, are allocated for investment from all sectors of society, so that everyone can share the benefits and gather ideas for broad benefits. The mill is currently publicly issuing shares. It is heard that those who have gone to the company to subscribe for shares in the past two days have been quite enthusiastic, with a strong sense of being first in line.</p>

<h3>Assassin of Yang Zaisan Reveals the Story of Xiong Jiandong's Betrayal; Says Yang Recently Suddenly Surrendered to a Certain Party; And Sold Out Xiong Jiandong for Murder</h3>
<p>Yang Zaisan, a wealthy merchant from Changshu, over sixty years old, has lived in the western countryside of Changshu for generations. Yang's son, Yang Xingfang, over thirty years old, organized a guerrilla force and appointed himself commander-in-chief after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident and the fall of Changshu. Yang Zaisan, due to his old age, took refuge in Shanghai and lived in No. 175, Lane Zhao Zhujiao Road in the French Concession. He recently rented room 606 on the sixth floor of the</p>
<p>Da Hu Hotel</p>
<p>On Dongxin Bridge, Aiduya Road. At 12:30 PM on the 5th, Yang and two friends finished lunch at the Juxing Restaurant at the entrance of Baoyu Lane and walked back to the Da Hu Hotel. On the way, Xu Zimao (43 years old), a native of Siyang, rushed out from the roadside and fired a gun at Yang, intending to assassinate him. Fortunately, the bullet jammed and Yang was not harmed. Detectives heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, arresting the thug Xu Zimao and taking him back to the police station for investigation. The details have been recorded in detail in this newspaper on the 6th. Yesterday, the police sent Xu to the</p>
<p>Special Second Court</p>
<p>Presiding Judge Zhang Minsheng interrogated him in the first criminal court. Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the French Concession authorities, stated the case, saying that the defendant was arrested for attempted murder, and the police department needed to investigate further. He requested that the defendant be detained, and a new date be set for two weeks to investigate the case and file charges for trial. Xu Ganmao confessed that Yang Zaisan was a local tycoon in Changshu, and his son was the commander-in-chief of the guerrilla force. Recently, he suddenly defected to the enemy. After the enemy appointed him as the commander of bandits, he betrayed Commander Xiong of the guerrilla force</p>
<p>Sold Out for Murder</p>
<p>And confiscated the Xiong family's property. Now Yang Zaisan is renting six rooms in the Da Hu Hotel, specializing in liaison with the enemy. Zhou Guorong and a Mr. Li pointed me out, saying that Yang was a major traitor, gave me a gun, and told me to shoot Yang Zaisan to death. At that time, Zhou and Li were also present. I held a gun and pointed it at Yang Zaisan's right temple and fired, wanting to shoot him to death. Unexpectedly, the bullet jammed and I was arrested. I recognize the victim Yang Ran San, and also said that Fan, the boss on the Meili ship, owes me several thousand yuan and has repeatedly refused to pay it back. I must have a grudge because of this. I have no enemies, etc. After verifying the confession in court, it was ordered to be re-interrogated on the 17th, and the defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Su Xiwen Assassination Attempt Not Deepened; Arrested Puppet Policeman Released</h3>
<p>Regarding the suspected assassination attempt on Su Xiwen, the puppet "Secretary-General of the Municipal Government," it was ascertained yesterday that the shooting occurred in the "Secretary's Office" on the third floor of the puppet "government." The shooter was a puppet policeman, a bodyguard in the puppet "Government Guard Team." The weapon was a 4-inch pistol (the rumor that Si Ge fired the gun at Su's residence on De Siwei Road in Hongkou is incorrect). After the incident, important figures in the puppet "government" immediately tried to make a big issue into a small issue, and a small issue into no issue. The detained perpetrator was charged with the minor crime of negligent discharge of a firearm. After being interrogated by Chen Jintao, the puppet "Guard Team Leader," he was slightly reprimanded and released yesterday. The Japanese side only sent personnel to inspect the scene of the incident for a week and saw that the glass window of the puppet "Secretary's Office" had been shattered, and the bullet had entered the room from the outside. No one else advocated a thorough investigation of the underlying causes of the case. Su Xiwen knew that the shooter would never dare to clean his gun with live ammunition outside the "Secretary's Office," but because he had lost power for a long time and was helpless, he did not want to pursue the matter. Seeing that no one was reporting the incident, the Japanese side also perfunctorily let it go. However, according to insiders, this matter was nothing more than a feud related to Su's past. Su Xiwen once forced [omitted] to step down, forging a deep hatred.</p>
<h3>Spring Sentiments (2)</h3>
<p>The time nears Qingming, a different kind of spring,</p>
<p>Parks everywhere are filled with visitors;</p>
<p>The fragrance of flowers attracts bees and butterflies,</p>
<p>The scent of powder draws young men near.</p>
<p>I pity you, afflicted and unable to indulge your feelings,</p>
<p>How many stages is the distant road to Wushan?</p>
<p>Your fortune in romance is not as good as the bees and butterflies,</p>
<p>Paired bees and butterflies are so intimate!</p>
<h3>Son's Malicious Abandonment: Elderly Woman Pleads for Support; Defendant Agrees to Provide After Mediation</h3>
<p>Xu Wu, a local woman residing at No. 41, Lane 166, Dagu Road, is 76 years old. Recently, she retained lawyer Gu Hanli to file a complaint with the First Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing her adopted son, Xu Baosheng, of abandonment. The gist of her complaint is as follows: She married Mao Liaogong, the defendant's uncle, at the age of nineteen. Sadly, her husband passed away just a year after their marriage. She remained a widow, living with her late father-in-law, Yongqiang Gong.</p>
<p>Her daily needs were supplemented by spinning yarn. After her father-in-law passed away (thirty-three years ago), she relied on her late aunt, Ruan, for sustenance. Because she had no children of her own, she adopted a daughter named Sibao, who has since married a man named Chen. Lonely and without support, she transferred all her property to the defendant, who agreed to be her adopted son. He also agreed to be responsible for her daily life and all funeral expenses after her death, providing for her for over ten years,</p>
<p>without any objections. Unexpectedly, the defendant has recently become involved in frivolous activities and bad habits. Whenever she tried to advise him, he treated her with animosity and secretly mortgaged the ancestral property without her consent. Unable to stop him, she fell ill, feeling lonely and abused. In December of last year, seeing her bedridden and unlikely to recover, the defendant intensified his actions, refusing to provide food and subjecting her to various forms of mistreatment. In her declining years,</p>
<p>plagued by illness, she was forced to temporarily reside with her adopted daughter, Sibao. She also instructed her lawyer to send a letter to the defendant, requesting financial support. However, the defendant deliberately abandoned her, ignoring her pleas. Considering that the defendant voluntarily became her adopted son and inherited her property, he should have served her with filial piety, fulfilling his filial duties. His malicious abandonment and abuse violate Article 294 of the Criminal Code. She also filed a civil suit, requesting the court to order the defendant to pay</p>
<p>monthly support of fifty yuan in national currency from January of this year until her death, as well as five hundred yuan for future funeral expenses, and to return her three hundred yuan in private savings. Yesterday morning, the case was heard by the presiding judge of the Second Criminal Division. Lawyer Gu Hanli, representing the plaintiff, stated that the defendant had already agreed to pay monthly living expenses of fifteen yuan and five hundred yuan for future funeral expenses. Therefore, he requested the court to find the defendant not guilty. After questioning the defendant, the presiding judge acquitted him.</p>
<h3>Over 300 Straw Sheds Consumed by Fire; Two Women Perish in the Blaze</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 1:20 PM, a fire broke out in a nameless bungalow near Bailinan Road and Sifei Road in the Public Concession. Due to the strong wind, the flames spread rapidly, quickly engulfing a large number of adjacent straw sheds. Firefighters arrived and worked hard to extinguish the blaze, but it took three hours. As a result, over 300 straw sheds and over ten bungalows were destroyed. During the height of the fire, two women perished in the flames.</p>
<h3>Police Vehicle Runs Over a Child</h3>
<p>Near the Risheng Building at Nanjing Road and Zhejiang Road, at approximately 11:55 AM yesterday, a child, about thirteen or fourteen years old, was walking when a public service vehicle from the Lao Zha Police Station sped by. The child was unable to avoid it, was knocked to the ground, and suffered fatal injuries. He was taken to Renji Hospital in an ambulance summoned by street police officer number 1596, but his injuries were too severe and he died upon arrival. The hospital transferred the body to the coroner's office for examination.</p>
<h3>Bank Employee Alters Passbook for Embezzlement; Lin Ganchen Sentenced to Four Months Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Lin Ganchen, a 35-year-old native of Hang County residing at No. 58, Changyun Lane, Xin Dagu Road, worked in the Document Section of the Siming Savings Society branch at No. 414, Tifei Road in the French Concession. Last winter, Lin's relative, Wu Zesheng, a 71-year-old from Guangdong, entrusted Lin Ganchen with seven hundred and twenty yuan in cash to deposit into the Siming Savings Society where he worked. However, after receiving the money, Lin only deposited six yuan, obtained a passbook, altered the passbook to show a deposit of seven hundred and twenty yuan, and returned it to Wu Zesheng, who did not examine it closely at the time. On March 30th of this year, Wu Zesheng entrusted another relative, Xia Shunlai, to withdraw the seven hundred and twenty yuan from the Siming Savings Society. The alteration was discovered by Li Minghua, an employee of the society, who detained Xia and reported it to the French police. Detectives investigated and discovered that Lin Ganchen, who had originally processed the deposit, was responsible for the alteration and embezzlement. Xia was released, and Lin Ganchen was arrested. He confessed to the embezzlement and alteration of the passbook. Lin was handed over to the Second Special Court, and the French Concession authorities prosecuted him for embezzlement and forgery of private documents. Lin retained lawyers Sun Zhongyao and Zhu Hongda for his defense. Judge Liao Yuan presided over the trial, and the verdict was announced on the designated date. The defendant Lin Ganchen was ordered to provide a five hundred yuan bond to guarantee his appearance. Lawyers Sun and Zhu provided the bond. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the verdict. Neither the defendant nor his defense lawyers appeared in court. Judge Zhang Minsheng, acting in the First Criminal Division, sentenced Lin Ganchen to four months imprisonment. During the appeal period, the defendant remained under the original bond.</p>
<h3>Mainland Apartment Owner Instigates Assault; Apartment Guest and Wife Beaten; Defendant Released on Bail Pending Trial</h3>
<p>Hu Shaochuan, a 37-year-old from Liyang, previously worked as a clerk in the Wuxian County Court in Suzhou. Since the fall of Suzhou and the closure of the court, Hu has been unemployed. He brought his wife, Qian (31 years old, from Suzhou), and children to Shanghai to seek refuge. On January 9th of this year, he rented Room 319 of the Mainland Apartment at No. 431, Pubai Road in the French Concession, agreeing to a monthly rent of thirty yuan, plus three yuan for miscellaneous expenses, totaling thirty-three yuan. By the 24th of last month, he had paid sixty-four yuan in rent, leaving a balance of eleven yuan at the end of the month. Hu intended to pay the balance at the end of the month. However, Xin Lichong (41 years old, from Ningbo), the manager of the apartment, refused. On the evening of that day, he ordered the tea boy to pressure Hu and his wife for payment. Unable to pay, they argued, which escalated into a physical altercation in which Hu and his wife were injured. Xin then reported the incident to the police, claiming that Hu owed rent and assaulted the tea boy. The case was dismissed as trivial. Hu, having been injured, requested the Second Special Court Prosecutor's Office to examine his injuries. He retained a lawyer to file a complaint with the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Xin Lichong of inciting assault and requesting a legal investigation. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liao convened a court hearing. The plaintiff, Hu Shaochuan, was unable to attend due to his injuries, but his wife, Hu Qian, and their lawyer appeared and testified about the assault. The defendant, Xin Lichong, and his defense lawyer, Zhu Liqing, appeared and denied instigating the assault, claiming that they were only collecting rent. After reviewing the evidence, the court ordered the defendant to provide a five hundred yuan shop guarantee pending a rescheduled hearing with witnesses.</p>
<h3>Suspected Robbers Discovered in Gambling Den; Gambler Shot While Attempting to Flee</h3>
<p>At approximately 10:50 PM last night, the Public Concession's Xin Zha Police Station received a report from a rickshaw puller claiming to be from a residence at No. 152, Jingfuli, Zhangjia Zhai Road, Aiwanyi Road, stating that a large number of robbers had broken into the residence and were committing robbery, requesting assistance. The police immediately dispatched patrol cars and informants to apprehend the suspects. However, no robbers were found in the residence. When the detectives entered the inner room, they discovered a gambling den with a large number of men and women gambling around a table, shouting excitedly. When they realized that the police were behind them, they tried to escape, but it was too late. They were all arrested. However, Ding Xiaodi (33 years old, local), residing at No. 40, Yongji Lane, Xin Zha Road, attempted to escape in desperation. The detectives shouted for him to stop, but he continued to run. The police fired a warning shot, hitting him and causing him to fall. He was apprehended. The gambling paraphernalia was confiscated and taken to the police station for investigation. Ding Xiaodi was first sent to Guangren Hospital for treatment. The identity of the ringleader and other details are still under investigation.</p>
<h3>Girl Injured by Car</h3>
<p>Chuan Gendi, a nine-year-old girl from Ningbo, residing upstairs at the Hong Qing Tang Guanqi shop on Longmen Road, Racecourse Road, was walking in the street at approximately 10:45 AM yesterday.

<h3>Resumption of the Sheng Yupeng Kidnapping Case; Ringleader Vehemently Denies Involvement; Hotel Waiter to be Summoned for Further Questioning</h3>
<p>Sheng Yupeng (9 years old), the son of Sheng Zecheng, manager of the Hanye Coal Mining Company, was a student at the Shanghai Municipal Council School on Da Xi Road. On the 20th of last month, he was nearly kidnapped by robbers at the school. The school's watchman discovered the incident, and the robbers abandoned their vehicle and fled. The police later arrested Chen Jin, son of Chen Fu, an old servant of the Sheng family, and a beggar named Zhang Zhixiong. Based on their confessions, they apprehended the ringleader, Zhang Jinqing, from Jiangbei. Yesterday, they were brought to the First Special Court's Second Criminal Division, charged with attempted kidnapping for ransom. Judge Xiao Peishen conducted the hearing. According to the defendant Chen Jindu, "I was originally a copper craftsman. After the war in Shanghai, I lost my job and had no food, so I stayed at the Sheng family's house and ate for free. The master gave me two yuan a month for expenses. I swear on my conscience that the Sheng family is my benefactor. Several days before this incident, Zhang Jinqing approached me several times, saying he wanted to kidnap our young master. At first, I refused, but later he said that after the kidnapping, the money would be divided equally. I agreed. Because I am illiterate, I met Zhang Zhixiong on the street asking for coins. I asked him if he could write. He said he could. I took him to a hotel and asked him to write several threatening ransom letters, preparing to send the letters to the Sheng family to demand a ransom after kidnapping the victim." The defendant Zhang Zhixiong stated, "I was begging on the street. This person asked me to write a few letters for him, saying he would give me some money. He didn't tell me about kidnapping." The defendant Zhang Jinqing stated, "I am truly innocent. I don't know the first defendant at all. I don't know why he is trying to accuse me. I ask the judge to investigate thoroughly." At this point, the court ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody, pending a rescheduled hearing to summon the waiter of the Anshang Hotel to testify.</p>

<h3>Good Opportunity to Revive the Guqin String Business</h3>
<p>Guqin strings were traditionally manufactured exclusively by Lao San Tai in Hangzhou. The number of strings sold directly by the store each year was quite large. In Shanghai, over a thousand sets were sold by various silk thread stores. This shows the large number of people who play the guqin. Now that Hangzhou has fallen, guqin strings have disappeared from the market. Guqin players everywhere are suffering from a shortage of strings. According to members of the Shanghai Jin Yu Guqin Society, they have investigated in Hangzhou and found that Lao San Tai has closed its doors. The old craftsman who made the strings has returned to his hometown in Shaoxing, and his address is unknown. If this person is willing to come to Shanghai to manage the old business or if there are existing strings for sale, they would be greatly welcomed and willing to provide any possible assistance. You can first contact Mr. Shen at No. 84, Cangzhou Villa, Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Specializing in Stealing Women's Earrings; Thirty-Four Thieves Apprehended; Many Gold Earrings Recovered; Owners Requested to Identify at Police Station</h3>
<p>Aiduoya Road, Dongxin Bridge, Longmen Road, Lujia Guanyintang and other places are gathering places for robbers who specialize in stealing women's earrings. Women riding in rickshaws are often robbed of their gold jewelry, and their ears are often torn in the process. Recently, Chief Detectives Jiang Shangpei and Yang Peisheng of the General Police Station apprehended thirty-four male and female suspects in this case, including Wu Jinsheng, Luo Jinkun, Lu Jinlong, Wang Aying, Yang Fusheng, Wang Fugen, Jin Agen, Lu Ruixiang, Ye Xianglin, Shou Ating, Ma Agen, Zhang Debiao, and Shi Bingsheng. Many gold earrings have been recovered and sent to the First Special District Court for questioning and detention. Although the police have discovered that the suspects have committed many crimes and recovered stolen goods, many victims have not reported the crimes to the police, which has hindered the progress of the investigation. Therefore, the police hope that all victims will promptly go to the Central Police Station on Sima Road to identify the stolen goods.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>Simplified Procedures for Registering Private Middle Schools; Jiangsu Education Department to Reduce Capital and Allow Borrowing of Books, etc.</h3>
<p>(Taixian Correspondence) The Ministry of Education has issued regulations for registering private middle schools in Jiangsu Province. However, the originally prescribed capital and start-up costs are very high, which cannot be achieved during the current war. In order to remedy the situation, the Department has formulated simplified measures. New private middle schools in intact counties will temporarily raise one-half of the Ministry's standard capital, and those in occupied counties will temporarily raise one-quarter. The school names will be prefixed with the word "Temporary." After the capital is fully raised, the names will be corrected. Public buildings and the books, instruments, and school equipment of closed schools may be temporarily borrowed for use. However, existing school lands, whether owned by the province, city, county, or school, may not be allocated. Private middle schools that cannot build their own school buildings and purchase sufficient equipment within two years after the war, or cannot comply with the Ministry's regulations and raise sufficient capital within three years, will be ordered to stop admitting new students. If they still do not comply in the fourth year, they will be ordered to close. After the schools are closed, they will be handled in accordance with Article 23 of the School Regulations. The Ministry of Education has been requested by telegram to approve the proposed measures. The Ministry has now telegraphed its approval to all county bureaus. (April 1st)</p>
<h3>Central Geng Fund Committee: Overview of Assistance to Education and Cultural Enterprises (Part 2) - Dispatching Government-Funded Students to Study in the UK - Subsidizing Scientific Researchers</h3>
<p>(III) Dispatching Government-Funded Students to Study in the UK</p>
<p>In the autumn of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), the first examination for government-funded students to study in the UK was held.  Up to now, there have been six sessions. A total of 124 government-funded students have been selected and sent to study in the UK, including 42 in science, 34 in engineering, 26 in arts, 12 in agriculture, and 10 in medicine. The duration of the government funding for each student is limited to three years as stipulated. Therefore, most of the students from the first, second, and third sessions, except for a few who remain abroad for further study due to academic needs, have completed their studies and returned to China and are eagerly sought after by various parties, with the majority taking up teaching positions at universities.  This year, the committee will continue to organize the seventh examination. The quota distribution has been tentatively set at eight places for science, including physics, chemistry, mathematics, geography, and other fields; eight places for engineering, including aeronautical engineering, shipbuilding, metallurgy, textiles, and other fields; four places for agriculture, divided into two places for veterinary medicine and two places for animal husbandry; two places for medicine, one for studying pharmacology and one for studying physiology. In addition, the humanities and law fields are set at two places for education, one focusing on educational administration and adult education, and one focusing on educational principles; and two places for law, one focusing on administrative law and one focusing on private international law. It is expected that they will set sail for the UK in the autumn.</p>
<p>(IV) Subsidizing Professors at Universities in Border Provinces and Inland Areas</p>
<p>Since the July 7th Incident, universities in Peiping and Tianjin have been forced to relocate one after another due to the circumstances. In addition to allocating large sums of money to assist the Ministry of Education in establishing the Southwest Associated University and the Northwest Associated University, the committee also sent outstanding teachers from various universities to border and inland universities to serve as lecturers, so that supply and demand could be appropriately adjusted. The initial subsidy approved by the committee was 85,000 yuan, which was later increased by 120,000 yuan, totaling 205,000 yuan. Currently, subsidies have been provided to Yunnan University (9 positions), Sichuan University (7 positions), Guangxi University (5 positions), Hunan University and Northeastern University (4 positions each), Wuhan University (3 positions), and Chongqing University (2 positions). The subsidy period was originally set for one year, with all professors' salaries and travel expenses borne by the provincial committees. After one year, due to repeated requests from the subsidized universities, the subsidy period has been extended to the end of July of this year, with half of the salaries borne during the extended period.</p>
<p>(V) Assisting Scientific Researchers Last year, in order to assist scientific researchers during the extraordinary period to continue their research work, the committee specially hired experts to form a committee to discuss and determine the methods, and allocated 138,000 yuan to handle assistance matters. Subsequently, due to the large number of applicants, an additional 125,000 yuan was allocated, totaling 263,000 yuan. In addition to allocating a portion to the working center committees in Chongqing, Kunming, Guilin, and Guiyang to subsidize the research and experimental expenses of various researchers, the remainder was used to cover the living expenses of those assisted. A summary of the situation is recorded below: (1) Number of assisted personnel: A total of more than 1,600 people applied for assistance. After review, 182 people were approved for assistance, plus ten substitutes, totaling 192 people. (2) Working institutions: All assisted personnel were sent to work at appropriate cultural and educational institutions selected by the various committees according to their research nature and work plans. The institutions all expressed welcome, provided them with facilities, and assigned experts to be responsible for their care. All members were able to concentrate on their research and achieved significant results. (3) Work reports: The assistance period was set at one year, from August 1938 to the end of July 1939. Each researcher prepared a detailed work report every three days, which was first submitted to the institution or person entrusted by the committee to add comments and then sent to the committee for further review by the various expert committees. Currently, the first and second phases of work reports have been submitted to the committee for review. (4) Experimental expenses: When researchers in the natural sciences groups were conducting research, in addition to borrowing books and instruments from the working institutions, the committee provided appropriate subsidies for necessary consumable drugs and materials, with a maximum amount of 100 yuan per person, which was issued by the working center committees in various regions.</p>
<p>(VI) Scientific Research Assistants In order to encourage and assist young scientific talents to continue their academic work, the committee specially allocated 60,000 yuan to establish 125 philosophy research assistant positions in domestic public and private universities, independent colleges, and research institutions, based on their academic equipment. The selection procedure was that the committee designated public and private universities and independent colleges to select and recommend outstanding graduates from the Class of 1937. If necessary, graduates from the Class of 1936 and the Class of 1935 could also be recommended. Once selected after review, the committee designated the work location for them to report and conduct research, with a mentor responsible for guidance. Each person received a monthly stipend of 40 yuan from the committee for living expenses, for a period of one year. Most of these research assistants have already been selected and are scheduled to report to work this month.</p>
<p>(VII) Organizing Scientific Exploration Teams</p>
<p>In order to assist young graduates from specialized schools and above, to provide them with on-site investigation experience, and to conduct scientific research and investigations in border provinces, the committee decided to allocate 150,000 yuan to organize three scientific exploration teams for the Southwest, Northwest, and Sichuan-Kang areas. Each team was to have one leader and one deputy leader, five to seven experts, one doctor, two staff members, and 40 team members. According to the academic disciplines, each team was divided into five groups: geology, mining, science and engineering, economics, society, and agriculture and forestry. The selection procedure for team members was that the committee designated public and private specialized schools and above to recommend outstanding graduates from the Class of 1937 (and, if necessary, the Class of 1936 and the Class of 1935). The working time for team members was tentatively set at one year, with three months for preparatory work, six months for field investigation, and the final three months for drafting reports. The living expenses for team members were 40 yuan per month per person, and travel expenses were also subsidized by the committee. To facilitate organization, the committee first organized the Sichuan-Kang Scientific Exploration Team, with western Sichuan and Xikang as the exploration areas. Shao Yizhou and Huang Guozhang have been hired as the team leaders, and the group leaders, experts, and team members have also been respectively invited and reviewed for selection. They are scheduled to depart in May of this year. The Southwest and Northwest Exploration Teams will also be organized soon. (End)</p>

Separate methods will be established for higher education inspection.</p>
<p>(VI) Regarding Education Funding:</p>
<p>(1) Establish a provincial, municipal, and county education fund system: 1. Provincial, municipal, and county governments should designate one or more types of tax revenue from provincial, municipal, and county taxes, in whole or in part, as an education fund. The percentage of the total revenue that this represents should be determined by the Ministry of Education. 2. If the municipal and county funds are too small, the provincial government should subsidize them. 3. If the municipal and county education funds have a surplus, a certain amount may be appropriated based on the educational needs of the municipality or county and included in the provincial education fund for unified expenditure. 4. Provincial, municipal, and county education funds should all establish an education fund management committee to manage the funds. The chairman of the provincial management committee should be the chairman of the provincial government, and the director of the finance department and the director of the education department should be ex officio members.

The education fund of the municipality directly under the Executive Yuan should form a separate unit.</p>
<p>(2) The Ministry of Education should supervise the expenses of all institutions and schools directly under the Ministry of Education, and the Ministry of Education should issue orders in accordance with laws and regulations.</p>
<p>(3) Subsidies for well-managed private and provincial, municipal, and county-run schools at all levels should be increased year by year.</p>

Schools whose actual expenses have not met the standard should find ways to increase their funding. 2. Based on the number of colleges, departments, and students, and taking into account the actual situation of each school, separately stipulate the number of positions, salaries, and wages for junior colleges, independent colleges, and universities. 3. Based on the nature of the departments, stipulate the number of teaching positions that each department should pay. 4. Based on existing regulations, the resolutions of the Second National Education Conference, and the budget and budget allocation tables of each school, formulate the proportion of the allocation of each budget item in order to increase the funds for books, instruments, and equipment and reduce administrative expenses. 5. After the budget items are set, efforts should be made to avoid transferring funds between them. 6. This method may also be suitable for provincial universities.</p>
<p>(VII) Regarding Educational Supplies:</p>
<p>(1) Schools and colleges purchasing foreign books and magazines should seek connections. 1. Formulate temporary measures for national, provincial, and private junior colleges and above to purchase foreign instruments, books, and educational supplies. 2.

<h3>Western Youth Volleyball - Hai Qing Defeats Russian Emigrants - Paramount Abandons the Game at Western Youth</h3>
<p>Western Youth volleyball had a total of three games last night, which started at 7:15 PM. In the first game, the Western Youth women's team played against the Key Team. As a result, Western Youth won in two straight games. The final game was Hai Qing playing against Russian Emigrants A. Hai Qing is a perennial winner in the league. The Russian Emigrants knew that they could not avoid defeat, so they tried their best to resist. Therefore, although Hai Qing took the lead step by step after the start of the game, the Russian Emigrants followed closely, and the score was always within two or three points. Hai Qing's Zheng Yiquan's smash was fierce and unparalleled. The Russian Emigrants lost several points in a row. In the first game, Hai Qing won with a score of 15 to 11. The situation in the final game remained the same. The scores of both sides increased alternately. When Hai Qing took the lead with a score of 14 to 10, Zheng Yiquan's three spikes were all off by a hair, allowing the Russian Emigrants to chase to 14 to 13. With one point left, there seemed to be a renaissance, but it was a flash in the pan. After several struggles for the right to serve, Mai Bingyao finally made a strange wave of his arm, creating a record of three wins and three losses for Hai Qing. The Russian Emigrants then suffered a crushing defeat. The last game was originally Paramount vs. Western Youth, but Paramount did not arrive at the last minute and was judged to have abandoned the game. Western Youth won the victory. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Western Youth 15-5 15-7 Key Team</p>

<h3>Thoroughness</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Everything has only positive and negative aspects, no neutral aspect; everything has only right and wrong ends, no middle ground. All neutrality or middle ground is only a temporary phenomenon, not eliminated by neutralization. For example, electricity mixes to become another thing, still opposing other things, such as all political organizations. This is the thoroughness of things, which originally exists in nature and human affairs. Whoever or whatever acts according to this principle will be in harmony with nature, without any difficulty, and will achieve something. Otherwise, disputes arise one after another, difficulties are heavy, and those who are not like the interaction of yin and yang electricity to become a thunder are rare!</p>
<p>Speaking of international affairs, initially, Chamberlain repeatedly bowed his head, seeking compromise with fascist countries, but as a result, the arrogance of fascist countries became stronger, the momentum of democratic countries became weaker, the number of weak and small victims became more, and compromise ultimately failed. Now, Chamberlain has realized this, making a loud lion's roar, and fascist countries are showing a tendency to cover their flags and cease drumming. This is the effectiveness of thoroughness; thorough non-compromise is a principle in accordance with nature.</p>
<p>It is a pity that Poland is still not thorough now. While fearing Germany, it is also afraid of approaching the Soviet Union to arouse Germany's jealousy, and also afraid that signing an agreement with Romania will break its friendship with Hungary. Only in a dilemma, it signed a unilateral agreement with the United Kingdom. I can say that this kind of incompleteness will inevitably lead to unexpected disputes in the future, causing her to suffer.</p>
<p>Speaking of our country's negotiations with Japan, haven't we initially sought compromise and made concessions again and again, hoping for some peace to live and work in peace? However, the other party took an inch and went further, oppressing us step by step, and insisting on making us slaves before stopping. This is the harm of incomplete resistance. Since the July 7th Incident, we have raised the banner of resistance, uniting the strength of the whole country to deal with the enemy country, and until now, we have been able to stabilize our national destiny after saving it from collapse. This is the benefit of thorough resistance.</p>
<p>It is a pity that there are now a group of short-sighted people or people with other agendas who are still advocating peace, not knowing that in the current situation, there is no other peace to be had except for surrender or victory. This is also their incompleteness. However, thorough surrender is of course out of the question: thorough victory, eliminating the traces of the enemy on our territory, is our only goal now. Therefore, we often thoroughly eliminate these advocates of heresy, so as not to hinder our thorough resistance and thorough victory.</p>
<p>In addition, in society, even in the affairs of a family or an individual, it is not impossible to view it in this way: thoroughness leads to everything going smoothly, like a knife splitting bamboo; incompleteness leads to thorns everywhere, making it difficult to move forward.</p>
<p>However, the thoroughness I am talking about is always positive and constructive. Even if it sometimes involves negativity or destruction, its purpose is still to be positive and constructive. I hope that this point will not cause any misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Little Fatty</h3>
<p>— Qian Changnian</p>
<p>From the very first day of classes this semester, that round, chubby face that everyone was familiar with was missing from the right corner of the classroom.</p>
<p>"Chengzhi, do you know why Little Fatty isn't here this year?"</p>
<p>"I don't really know. But Lu Rujun told me that he went to Little Fatty's house the day before yesterday afternoon and only saw Little Fatty's father sighing and his mother crying, but he never saw Little Fatty's shadow..."</p>
<p>For several days in a row, the classmates talked about Little Fatty's disappearance.</p>
<p>His surname was Zhang, his given name Yaohua, and "Little Fatty" was just a nickname derived from his weight of over one hundred and seventy pounds. He rarely spoke, but he wasn't putting on a show of seriousness like a moralistic scholar. No matter who called him "Little Fatty," he would always grin and laugh, never losing his temper. But this wasn't weakness; he was born to stand up for injustice. In terms of family circumstances, he had more than enough money to go to the cinema to watch movies of the "unlimited spring" type, but he would rather spend a dollar to buy books on subjects such as philosophy of life, lectures on youth self-cultivation, and current affairs analysis. He never set foot in the cinema. He also had enough money to have many Western-style clothes made to wear, but all year round he was always wearing that faded, broken blue cloth robe.</p>
<p>Among many classmates, he and I were the closest. From his appearance, he looked like a dull and stupid person, but once in conversation with him, he would bring up things like monism, the cycle of law, idealism, materialism... even I couldn't understand. I admit: I was really ashamed at the time, only agreeing hesitantly. Later, he stood up, patted me on the shoulder and said:</p>
<p>"Fu! You still need to read more books. Ha! Ha! Don't be offended! You haven't read enough before!"</p>
<p>He often told me that his lifelong ambition was to join the army. With his strong physique, calm personality, and full knowledge, I believed he would definitely be a model soldier of the motherland.</p>
<p>The raging flames of war spread from the north to southern China. When the Battle of Shanghai was taking place, he was also in the rear, responsible for rescue and transportation work. After the war moved west, he took off his military uniform and returned to school.</p>
<p>From this time on, the smile on his face disappeared. His heart was tormented by a kind of conflicting struggle: he wanted to join the army in the interior, but his parents stopped him because he was their only son.</p>
<p>Gradually, he fell ill from excessive worry. After two months in the hospital, he finally recovered. But his face had become emaciated and unrecognizable. I comforted him, saying:</p>
<p>"Yaohua! You've become terribly thin. Study in peace! Don't think too much..."</p>
<p>"Don't they (referring to his classmates) still call me 'Fatty'?" he smiled mischievously at me. I could see: it was a forced bitter smile.</p>
<p>When the winter vacation started last semester, I returned to my home in Hong Kong on business. On my return to Shanghai, my ship was delayed for a few days due to a storm. When I arrived, school had already started. Unexpectedly, this short month of separation would result in the loss of my dearest friend!</p>
<p>"Where has he gone?"</p>
<p>I know that he is now holding a gun at the front, fighting for justice!</p>
<p>Soon, the classmates' conversations about "Little Fatty" went from indifferent to silent. Only my heart is forever weighed down by a stone of lead.</p>
<h3>The Application of Abstraction</h3>
<h3>Resisting Grain Tax</h3>
<p>— Jieyang</p>
<p>The entire town was shrouded in a gloomy sky. The biting cold wind patrolled the corridor-like streets, making them seem particularly desolate and bleak.</p>
<p>Unusual waves stirred in the town's river. From the east and west ports, groups of boats arrived, carrying nearly a hundred young people. From their wide-brimmed felt hats, it could be known that they were all heroes from the shores of Cheng Lake, known for their "fighting strength."</p>
<p>A robust young man jumped ashore first, struck the iron hoe in his hand, and shouted loudly to the group standing on the boat: "Take your tools with you! Today we'll show them whether we're tough or not, understand?" With a wave of his hand, the group on the boat surged ashore.</p>
<p>Holding hoes, carrying poles, iron rulers... like a tide, they surged straight towards the western end of the town, reaching the front of the "District Office." The robust young man raised the wooden plaque hanging at the entrance, which read "Land Tax Collection Office," and struck the false policeman standing at the door: "Damn you, today we're here to settle the grain tax!"</p>
<p>They charged straight inside and went upstairs. There was only the money accountant, known as a malicious lawyer, there. Without saying a word, they swarmed around him, punching and kicking him for a while, then threw him out the window and down the stairs.</p>
<p>Amidst the chaotic sounds of destruction, a shout rose up: "Go to 'Director One-Eye's' house! Go... to... go..."</p>
<p>Like a tide, they surged again towards the dye shop around the corner, which was the home of "Branch President" and "Tax Collection Director" Ma One-Eye.</p>
<p>But they searched the house thoroughly and didn't see that bastard One-Eye.</p>
<p>"Good, we should burn the furniture of the traitor to vent our anger!" The robust young man picked up two chairs and moved them out. "Everyone move them out! Move them to the temple grounds to burn!"</p>
<p>Nearly a hundred people moved together, emptying the house in an instant. On the temple grounds, a mountain of things was piled up—tables, benches, clothes, even the cloth soaking in the dye vats was fished out and piled there.</p>
<p>The masses crowded the temple grounds, packed like sardines. They applauded and cheered as the raging flames roared.</p>
<p>The town, which had been as dead as death, was filled with a warm vitality.</p>
<h3>Liu Er Kills the Traitors (Wartime Ballad)</h3>
<p>— Jingxi</p>
<p>Deep snow on the top of Changbai Mountain, clear water flowing by the Heilongjiang River. By the mountains and waters, there is a farmer named Liu Er, who plows and sows wheat every year. He enjoys the four seasons, sowing in winter and harvesting in summer, working at sunrise and resting at sunset. He only hates the indiscriminate invasion of the ×× pirates, turning every place their troops reach into a desolate village. Women are raped and men are killed. This Liu Er was dragged away by the pirates to carry military supplies, whipped day and night like an ox or a horse, not like a human being. One day, he set off with the army outside the city gate of Suqian, where the Japanese devils were lined up and camped.</p>
<p>Our planes roared in the sky, and the sound of cannons shook the earth like thunder. With a shout from our loyal and brave soldiers, the enemy soldiers scattered like birds and beasts. Liu Er saw the enemy soldiers scattering, and his patriotic heart surged up: as quick as lightning, he seized a Japanese gun and started fighting the enemy soldiers. The enemy soldiers were as numerous as the sea all around, but Liu Er didn't care. He shot at those far away and stabbed at those nearby, killing countless enemy soldiers. As he killed, he shouted: "Now is the time to perform meritorious service and kill the enemy!" His shouts echoed across the wilderness, moving the forced cooks to tears. They immediately rose up within the enemy camp, and the sound of killing shook the mountains and forests. Our army advanced from one side, and the cooks moved from the rear with knives, trapping the enemy soldiers from both sides. They perished under the artillery fire. The beautiful rivers and mountains are still returned to China, and our army celebrates with joy. This is the story of Liu Er killing the traitors. May all compatriots love their country and family, and may their descendants resist the enemy.</p>
<h3>Cultural Merchants and Cultural Figures</h3>
<p>— Chihuai</p>
<p>This is a capitalist society. The characteristic of this society is the commodification of all things. The posture of cultural figures, no matter what their own will may be, cannot escape appearing as commodities. Although engaging in culture is a hardship now, it is a historical destiny and cannot be escaped by individual effort.</p>
<p>However, according to the capitalist principle of "fair" trade, the seller and buyer of a commodity each stand on an "equal" footing, each engaging in transactions according to their so-called "free will." The seller can bargain and the buyer can counter-offer, even if this is a form of pseudo-freedom.</p>
<p>But the "trade" between cultural figures and cultural merchants is an exception. Except for the works of a few famous writers that have fixed prices (and even then, it's less that the seller sets the price and more that the buyer sets it based on the seller's reputation), it's rare to see a writer pricing their products for sale. This is because writers only pay attention to their works and not much to the price they should get for them. They can't estimate the "production cost"—the cost—of their products like other commodities. They submit their manuscripts to publishers or other distributors, and the buyer unilaterally calculates the so-called manuscript fee of so much money per thousand words. For a writer, haggling over money is considered a kind of shame. This concept has become a long-standing general psychology of writers.</p>
<p>The main goal of cultural workers is to promote the progress of society, so they don't aim for money. In terms of the advantages of cultural figures, in addition to obtaining a portion of the money necessary for life, they also gain a certain degree of social status. But under the current social circumstances, this certain degree of status often sacrifices their minimum necessary livelihood. We therefore see the pale and thin faces of ordinary writers, the shabby appearance of poor scholars. Regarding the tragic lives of ordinary writers, there are many writers who have died in poverty as evidence, so I won't say more here.</p>
<p>If the tragic life of ordinary writers is indeed entirely dedicated to the progress of society, then I dare to say on behalf of every writer that they are willing. But the facts tell us otherwise. Those engaged in culture, like many other laborers, are subjected to the exploitation and extraction of a small group of people, and this group is the cultural merchants. They exploit the weakness of writers who are ashamed to argue about monetary compensation, extracting cultural laborers by means that exceed the exploitation of ordinary laborers. This was true before the war, and it is especially a solid fact in today's wartime.</p>
<p>Many of you readers may envy the life of a writer, but what you imagine in your mind is only the life of a few writers with special status, or the legendary life of a writer in the American wild west. As for the current state of life of ordinary writers, only those who live that actual life can appreciate the taste of it. Although it is by no means a Shangri-La, it cannot be told to outsiders.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about the remuneration for the work of cultural figures today, it's impossible to talk about it. We only need to ask if their work has any remuneration. Yes, I dare not say there is no remuneration at all. But before a writer can obtain the remuneration they deserve for their work, they must first learn the face of a petty merchant. There are not many writers who have this ability, but they are definitely in the minority.</p>
<p>And so, the cultural merchants who live parasitically on the labor of cultural figures can always live their dissolute lives in brothels and dance halls. Anyway, many cultural institutions are producing a large reserve army of unemployed cultural workers, so they don't have to worry about writers dying out.</p>
<p>To avoid the provocations of traitors and Trotskyists, we are unwilling to specifically point out how cultural merchants are exploiting writers' careers today. We abide by the national laws of labor-management cooperation and are unwilling to create disputes that give enemies a pretext for discord. We also don't want to demand an increase in the living standards of cultural figures during this difficult period for the entire nation—although we support improving the living standards of the general population, we demand a minimum standard of living. We believe that cultural work is a powerful force in assisting the victory of the war of resistance. We cannot allow cultural merchants to exploit without limit—not paying manuscript fees, swallowing royalties, stealing and printing the works of original authors who are far away in the interior, etc. This is equivalent to the behavior of bandits! At the very least, moral sanctions should be imposed.</p>

<h3>Extinguishing Fires</h3>
<p>— Ge'er</p>
<p>If "fire" is a dangerous thing, then extinguishing dangerous "fire" and ensuring that "fires" do not occur is a very correct learning activity and also a good deed that greatly contributes to the safety of humanity in the world.</p>
<p>However, "fire players" do not think so. They believe that the reason why "fire" is "dangerous" is because there are "flammable materials" in the world in the first place.</p>
<p>Therefore, "fire players" believe that burning "flammable materials" with "fire" is the only way to eliminate "fires." Because in their consciousness, if there were no "flammable materials" in the world, wouldn't "fire" naturally extinguish itself?</p>
<p>It is natural that people feel "strange" when they hear this so-called "theory" of "fire players." The only reason why "fire players" make such seemingly correct but actually absurd statements is to cover up their "fire playing" tricks.</p>
<p>For example, when Hitler annexed Austria and swallowed the Sudetenland last year, the world was in a state of panic. Then Hitler, this "fire player," made a statement to Britain and the whole world: he had no territorial demands on the world! However, "fire" is "fire" after all. If you don't extinguish it, but avoid it out of fear, that won't work. Therefore, Czechoslovakia was swallowed up again, even though Hitler had also declared to Britain and the whole world that Germany did not want to dominate other nations. "Then Czechoslovakia is not a Germanic people!" However, Czechoslovakia is a "flammable material"!</p>
<p>If you don't believe it, look at how he justified the destruction of Czechoslovakia? He said, "If Czechoslovakia does not oppress the Germans and become a tool of communism, then we will never take any action against an independent Czechoslovakia." This is Hitler's unwavering loyalty to the "Anti-Comintern Pact," and no one can say he isn't. Although Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov, who was being "defended against," exposed this trick, saying, "The Anti-Comintern Pact is a geological term." However, the most truthful people in the world are none other than Hitler and Mussolini, and Japan, which promotes righteousness in the Far East. Anyone who is not a "tool of communism" is a "communism itself." Can their words be trusted? Therefore, Hitler's destruction of Czechoslovakia is very legitimate, because "I believe that I have made a great contribution to peace, because I have eliminated the 'great danger' in Central Europe." In this way, people should call upon God to thank our god of peace, Hitler!</p>
<p>However, although the seemingly correct words of "fire players" have deceived some foolish people, once "fire" burns to people's feet, anyone who is not wood or stone will jump up and try to extinguish it. "Fire" is a dangerous thing after all. Those who have been deceived by "fire players" in the past can still wake up in time. In order to prevent the world from suffering terrible "fires" again, I hope that no one in the world will believe a word of what the "fire players" say!</p>
<p>Everyone rise up and extinguish "fires"!</p>
<h3>Thoughts on "The Little Colonel"</h3>
<p>— Li Zhihua</p>
<p>A 20th Century Fox production, playing at the Grand Light Theater.</p>
<p>On the surface, "The Little Colonel" is still a Shirley Temple bouncing and frolicking film, but undeniably, this film is different from the singing and dancing films she starred in in the past.</p>
<p>We can also see this from the story:</p>
<p>"Architect Jeff has always had ambitions to build high-rise buildings in poor areas to benefit the poor. However, due to the economic downturn and financial stagnation, the project cannot proceed, and Jeff loses his job and goes bankrupt as a result. Jeff married early and his wife has passed away. His daughter, Penny, sees her father depressed all day, staying at home, and is often reprimanded by the apartment manager, Walters, for playing with the young children of the neighbors. She is greatly puzzled and asks Jeff why. Jeff says it is because 'Uncle Sam' (the nickname for the United States) is in trouble, so everything is hindered. Upon hearing this, Penny intends to help 'Uncle Sam' solve the difficulties so that Jeff can smoothly proceed with his plan."</p>
<p>From the description quoted above, we can see that "The Little Colonel" is different from the previous films that were simply love stories with Shirley's songs and dances as the backbone. Although Irving Cummings, who is accustomed to directing Shirley's "Little Something" films, still treats this very good film in the same way as the previous films, thereby insulting the merits of this script, there are still some points of the merits of the script that can be seen, such as the difference between the entertainment of the two types of children, and the boundaries between them.</p>
<p>Of course, the playwright is only a reformist. He optimistically uses Penny's performance to raise money for "Uncle Sam" to move the banker Hanshaw, who is called "Uncle Sam," to declare to reporters that he will "fully support Jeff's plan to build houses." Thus, he gives a satisfactory answer, as if the problem of housing for the poor has really been solved from then on.</p>
<p>This answer is of course still an empty shell, but the author cleverly connects the banker Hanshaw, this "Uncle Sam," with the nickname "Uncle Sam" for the United States, "preparing for the performance to help him." Opening this here and now encourages children's love for the country, which is definitely beneficial in any case. The evaluation of "The Little Colonel" should be above other "Little Something" films. The key should lie in this.</p>
<p>The "Uncle Sam" banker Hanshaw who appears on the screen is made up to look similar to the Uncle Sam representing the United States that we see in cartoons. This is of course for the needs of the plot, but it is precisely where the author's painstaking efforts lie.</p>
<p>As for other aspects of the performance, they are not much different from Shirley's previous films. Irving Cummings still uses his usual old methods. Even the script is mostly the same, such as the insertion of clowns to adjust and enhance the atmosphere. In this play, there are also Joan Davis and others. Franklin Pangborn, who plays the apartment manager, although the author wants to write his snobbish tone of flattering the rich and bullying the poor, his face is still that of a clown.</p>
<p>Shirley Temple still maintains her past precocious tone. As for the so-called "Movie Emperor" Lionel Barrymore, this gentleman is even more miserable than Janet Gaynor. He has gradually been forgotten by us. Here, he is just stable.</p>
<h3>Correction</h3>

<p>In yesterday's article "Talking about Mr. Ma Xiangbo," the character "列" in the tenth line, "I dare not place myself among Mr. Ma's students" was mistakenly printed as the character "绝." This is hereby corrected. Also, the article "Every Day is April Fool's Day" by Sleeping Buddha on the first of this month was not written by me. I dare not take the credit.

<h3>Exile, Part Two</h3>
<p>By Li Yishan</p>
<h3>Library</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>A repository of knowledge and sustenance, a few requests to New Asia.</p>
<p>In the present era of striving for universal education and eliminating illiteracy, libraries also have a very important mission. Not only can they make various effective contributions to the advancement of education, but also, in the process of social evolution, they can guide the general direction of social progress, especially among young people who seek knowledge and life experience. In the cultural sector during the Anti-Japanese War, it is an indispensable tool for promoting culture and irrigating national consciousness. Therefore, cultural groups, as long as they are well-organized and have a wide scope, always attach absolute importance to libraries, and at least have a "reading room."</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the number of libraries established by various cultural institutions seems to be very large, exceeding any other city in the country. However, if viewed in proportion to the population, the number of libraries in Shanghai is really insufficient, even below the standard compared to the interior, not to mention that general readership is limited.</p>
<p>Libraries in Shanghai can generally be divided into two types: restricted and public. The former are mostly affiliated with universities, such as: Shanghai University Library (169 Yuanyuan Road); St. John's, Soochow, Zhijiang, and Fudan Four University Joint Library (Cishudda Building, Nanjing Road); Soochow Law School Library (Mure Hall near the Racecourse); Aurora University Library (2nd floor of the school on Luban Road); Customs Library (1708 Xinzha Road); the latter, public ones include: New Asia Library (Cishudda Building, Nanjing Road); YMCA Library (Eight Immortals Bridge); Mingfu Library (533 Albert Road); Municipal Council Public Library (Beijing Road); Chinese Circulating Library (Fuzhou Road) and others.</p>
<p>Although the internal facilities of those libraries with restricted access are good and there are many books on specialized subjects, they are only limited to the faculty, staff, students, and people with considerable connections of each institution, and outsiders have no way to inquire. I will not go into details. Among the publicly accessible ones, there are also various troublesome issues, such as: Mingfu requires a written introduction from a group; the YMCA requires a fee; circulation is small; the Municipal Council Library focuses on Western books. In the "isolated island," the library with the most genuinely public Chinese books seems to be only New Asia (formerly Shen Bao, later renamed Liangcai, after the war it was renamed Dingxiang, and now it is renamed New Asia). Because it is located in the heart of the Public Concession, it has convenient transportation conditions, and its internal facilities are also very complete. In terms of books, it has everything: science, technology, politics, military affairs, economics, education, construction, finance, transportation, astronomy, geography, philosophy, physiology, medicine, as well as novels and creations by celebrities, etc. In terms of newspapers, in addition to the major newspapers of Shanghai on that day, there are also: the Central Daily News and Xinhua Daily from Chongqing, the Nanning News from Guangxi, and the Fujian Daily and Zhejiang Daily from Fujian, etc., which are of great help and effectiveness in communicating news between the "isolated island" and the interior, allowing readers to learn about the outline of the local dynamics in various parts of the interior. Therefore, the reading room is always full; it is a pity that its allocation of the number of newspapers in the city is too stubborn, seemingly four copies across the board, so that famous newspapers are in short supply, with people snatching and grabbing, and the quick-footed get there first, while some newspapers lie quietly on the shelves all day, and no one cares about them. Regarding this, I hope that the library will make appropriate adjustments to meet the needs within the possible range.</p>
<p>As for magazines, although the types are rich and access is free, because there are too many readers, those who arrive later have regrets. However, there is no need to worry about readers crowding around books. You can sit in the reading room all day at will, studying, copying, without restrictions, and without spending a cent, even if the number of exchanges is high, you will not be treated with unpleasant contempt.</p>
<p>Recently, the library has also organized "knowledge lectures." Readers only need to write down their name, resume, address, etc., to receive a lecture ticket (free of charge). This is really good news for poor young people who are unable to study and feel knowledge-starved.</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 7: Young Swallows and New Orioles, Shadows Linked as Double Jewels; Yue Silk and Wu Brocade, Looms Weaving Sevenfold Patterns</p>
<p>When the He family’s two young ladies were seeing their father off on his trip north, didn't they say that they wouldn't return to Guangdong for the time being, and that Shanghai was too noisy, so they wanted to choose a place near Shanghai to build a small villa? And didn't they also say that they would keep an eye out while visiting their classmate Zhu Ai'ren? Now there's another letter mentioning the establishment of a silk weaving factory, and it would be best to set up that silk weaving factory between Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. Now Zhu Ai'ren is also asking them to set up the factory here – not in Anle Town, but in Freedom Village. Although it's a joke, setting up a factory here isn't impossible. These days, Liyu and Shuangyu often take walks near Anle Town and see a lot of mulberry fields, knowing that this area was originally a silkworm farming region. They also heard Zhu Ai'ren say that Freedom Village is the same. However, Freedom Village is a new village, and everything is in its initial stages. If we set up our factory in Freedom Village, what inconveniences might there be? If it's really built there, a new factory added to a new village will naturally prosper a lot right away. Although they think this way in their hearts, they don't say it, because the original idea of building a villa has now expanded to establishing a factory. However, their father's letter has to be answered, with the gist being: "We agree in principle to the establishment of a silk weaving factory. What did we originally study? We originally wanted to revitalize our country's textile industry after returning home, so that it could be sold all over the world. Now that we have this opportunity, to urge the success of this factory is a matter of both public and private benefit, and we must work hard for it. Since the capital is already available, the first step is to find a location. Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces have always been silkworm farming areas and silk producing areas, so setting up a silk weaving factory between the two provinces is, of course, the most logical choice. However, we also need to consider the land and water transportation convenience, and especially the areas where workers congregate. Now we are looking for a location while drafting the plan to submit to our father for approval." They replied to their father with such a quick letter, and then the two of them started drafting the plan. According to He Liyu's idea, "I feel that one million yuan may not be enough to properly run a textile factory. First, we want the latest models for both the building and the machinery. Because our textiles are intended to be sold abroad, not just domestically. There aren't many such textile factories in the country right now, so of course, we must strive for excellence in our products. If we want to strive for excellence in our products, the capital must be ample. Otherwise, if our goods are selling well abroad, we may have concerns about insufficient capital to handle turnover."

<p>Entertainment World</p>
<h3>Saturday and the Entertainment World</h3>
<p>— Xin Ying</p>
<p>Saturday in Shanghai, perhaps in the whole world, is the most active day for the entertainment world, even more lively than Sunday. If you were to tally the visitors to each entertainment venue, Saturday would definitely have more than Sunday. Therefore, every Saturday, the entertainment world is sure to freshen things up a bit!</p>
<p>First, let's talk about Peking Opera. Every Peking Opera theater must schedule a good show on Saturday. If there's a new play, they'll also choose a Saturday for the first performance. In our childhood, we knew early on that Shanghai's theaters would perform day shows on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Day show tickets were cheaper than night shows, and Saturday's shows were good, so smart people would choose Saturdays to see a play in Shanghai. That's what we were used to hearing in the countryside.</p>
<p>Movie theaters, whether they're showing foreign films or domestic films, first-run or second/third-run theaters, also choose Saturdays to switch films. And every movie theater, come Saturday, the box office is bustling, always more so than other days.</p>
<p>Entertainment venues, once a week on Saturdays, will also adjust or refresh the entertainment program, adding fresh entertainment, always choosing a lucky Saturday to debut. And in every entertainment venue, on Saturday, whether it's during the day or at night, every venue is packed with visitors, even putting up "Full House" signs at the entrance, with the iron gates closed.</p>
<p>On Saturdays, all dance halls will have tea dances or hold various special program performances. The large number of dancers will make it difficult for each dance hostess to cope. Although there's a curfew now, some dance halls in Shanghai still operate all night on Saturday nights, dancing until dawn.</p>
<p>The reason why Shanghai's various entertainment venues are more lively on Saturdays than on Sundays is not without reason: because general foreign firms or institutions are closed to the public on Saturday afternoons and all day on Sundays. But on Sunday, if you play all night, the next day is Monday, and you have to be at the office by nine o'clock. Wouldn't you not even have time to sleep? It's better to play all night on Saturday, and then you can just sleep for half a day during the day on Sunday, without a care in the world. That's right, that's the reason.</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Yi Hua Film Company</h3>
<p>— Hai Yi</p>
<p>In the past, the Yi Hua Film Company had absorbed the most outstanding directors in all of Shanghai, and the films they made involved huge amounts of capital. Judging by their prominent position at the time, they were no worse than the China United Film Company of today.</p>
<p>Until before the war, the Yi Hua Film Company seemed to have suffered a slight setback. Now, the Yi Hua Film Company has resumed film production. Although they are in a special environment, they continue to strive. This spirit is very admirable.</p>
<p>However, recently, many unfavorable rumors about the Yi Hua Film Company have been circulating from various sources. Especially around the time of the premiere of "Chu Ba Wang" (The Conqueror), we heard many negative messages about them. In order to thoroughly understand Yi Hua's position and future film production policies, we made a special visit to Mr. Yan Youxiang, the current supervisor of the Yi Hua Film Company. He frankly stated four points and hoped that all sectors could trust the Yi Hua Film Company, and that they would definitely follow the path desired by the audience to produce meaningful works.</p>
<p>First, regarding future film production policies: Mr. Youxiang said very directly, "Working in such a harsh environment (their studio is on a road built beyond the boundaries), although we will encounter many difficulties, we will never produce bizarre, absurd, or toxic works. This belief, as can be seen in past works, will be adhered to in the future as well."</p>
<p>Second, I raised many external concerns. We would like to express our sincerity ten thousand times that this is completely unfounded. Fortunately, public opinion is fair and they have not been deceived. This is very fortunate for our company, but it is also very fortunate for the Chinese film industry." Speaking here, he said in a more determined tone, "In the future, we will use action to defeat the conspiracies of slanderers. We hope that the realm of public opinion can help us with this."</p>
<p>Third, I mentioned the recently released "Chu Ba Wang" (The Conqueror). Some people who have seen this film believe that there are insinuations in it, and Mr. Yan said it very well. He said, "Regarding 'Chu Ba Wang' (The Conqueror), I dare to declare from the position of the Yi Hua Film Company that there is absolutely no insinuation. However, because it was made into a film hastily without careful consideration beforehand, it was not until after the public screening, after everyone's corrections, that many malpractices were discovered. Therefore, we do not deny the failure of 'Chu Ba Wang' (The Conqueror). The main rumors are saying that Yi Hua Film Company's films will be screened in Nanjing, and that they will be screened in Suzhou. Mr. Youxiang stated: "Recently, some people have spread rumors that our company's new films are being screened in the occupied areas. This kind of deliberate destruction is a fantasy, or rather, it is due to the unclear theme of the whole play. We hope that the cultural world can give us some help so that our works can reach a perfect state and not be misinterpreted and misunderstood like 'Chu Ba Wang' (The Conqueror)." As he said this, his tone became very low and sincere, and he continued, "Therefore, we have decided that before every film is started, all scripts must first be reviewed by everyone before a decision is made to start filming, so as to avoid the same situation from happening again. ……"</p>
<p>Fourth, we roughly mentioned a little about the problem of the private lives of film stars. He also hopes that the outside world can urge them more so that they can be more actively upward. The Yi Hua Film Company will also continue to work harder and more resolutely, and hopes that all sectors can give him some guidance.</p>
<p>Finally, we talked about the screening of Yi Hua films at the Donghe Pavilion in Suzhou. He said that he didn't know at first, but now the contract has been torn up and the films are being recovered one after another.</p>
<p>When I said goodbye and came out, I hoped that your company can adhere to these beliefs, grow up healthily, and that in the Chinese film industry, you are also a powerful new force!</p>
<h3>Recent Photo of Charlie Chaplin</h3>
<p>— (Mu)</p>
<p>Chaplin is now making a film, "The Dictator." This is a "comedy," but it takes dictators as its subject matter. This is a very serious matter. Mr. Zhuo is appearing with a newer posture. He has opened his mouth and is throwing sarcasm at those "tyrants." Laugh, laugh, laugh, let everyone laugh.</p>
<h3>After the Completion of "Unavoidable Affection"</h3>
<p>— Hai Sheng</p>
<p>Four years ago, when I was in Hangzhou, a group of Shehua Theater Troupe performing there adapted my long short story "Fallen Woman" into a play. The content described the dark side of the lives of female waiters in Hangzhou. The playwright was Qin Ouan, and I also participated in some of the opinions and directing work. After the performance, although the results cannot be said to be very successful, it did not disappoint me.</p>
<p>Recently, I have been closer to the members of the Grand World United Drama Club. Encouraged by them, the "wish" buried in my heart has been revived. After three weeks, I wrote this "Unavoidable Affection." Its content is about a female opera singer, Cheng Qiuping, who, under the pressure of a harsh environment, is rescued by a chivalrous young man, Zhang Zhihong, and is able to escape and maintain her innocence. In terms of significance, it aims to enhance the personality of female opera singers and expose the true faces of general wealthy and powerful gentry. This play has been approved and adopted by the Lianyou Society, so it has finally found a way out.</p>
<p>Now, the Lianyou Society has scheduled the first performance for the evening of the 14th, directed by Wei Yan, the director of the script. This group has excellent actors such as Xu Renqiu, Yin Mengshi, Xu Yunli, and Yang Meimei. I think there will be good results. I hope the audience can give us a faithful, objective, and kind guidance and criticism.</p>

<p>Shadows of the Dance World</p>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<h3>Is a Dance Hostess a Good Profession?</h3>
<p>When many people encounter a discussion with several different viewpoints, they like to use one sentence to resolve it, saying that the benevolent see benevolence and the wise see wisdom. So-called, one thing is right, and another thing is wrong. In this way, the question of who is right and who is wrong is considered resolved.</p>
<p>"Kao Shuowen" says that the word "right" is "is." It can be seen that the meaning of the word "is" is absolute. For example, if I say I am Chen Xiaotian, I can say that everyone other than me is not Chen Xiaotian. If this dance hall is Xianle, I can say that other dance halls are not Xianle. But you must know that "is" is not necessarily good, and "not" is not necessarily bad. "Right and wrong" is one question, and "good and bad" is another question.</p>
<p>(17) According to the principles of economics, a certain need must exist in society before a profession can arise. In other words, the emergence of a profession is to supply the needs of society. In other words, if there is no such need in society, this profession cannot exist at all. Therefore, there are people who need to eat and wear, so there are grain stores, restaurants, silk cloth stores, and tailor shops. There are patients, so there are doctors and pharmacies. There are customers who like to dance, so there are dance halls and dance hostesses. According to this, a dance hostess is of course a profession. At the time, a friend refuted me, saying that according to you, are the beggars on the road also needed by society? Why can they still exist even if society doesn't need them? I said, in fact, there are also some people who need them. If absolutely no one in society is willing to give them money, I can be sure that there would be no beggars.</p>
<p>From a political point of view, any profession should have some positive impact on society. Otherwise, it should be corrected or banned. Now we should study whether the profession of dance hostess has a positive impact on society. According to my view, the original intention of any profession has a positive impact on society. As for the negative impact that occurs, it is due to the misunderstandings and mistakes of the employees. For example, the profession of doctor is originally for treating diseases and relieving suffering, and the profession of lawyer is originally for protecting human rights. As for receiving some remuneration for fulfilling obligations, it is of course reasonable and appropriate. If they are too selfish or perfunctory, and make mistakes in the condition of the illness or the case, it will have a negative impact on society, but it should not be said that doctors and lawyers are bad professions. Therefore, the profession of dance hostess, although it is said to be for entertaining people, proper entertainment cannot but be said to be a necessary element of life. So I advise a group of dance hostesses to recognize their profession, not to belittle themselves, not to only seek profit, not to neglect their business, and not to open loopholes and make traps. When guests come to dance, regardless of who they are, they must always maintain an amiable smile. When sitting in a chair and buying tickets to go out, they must always maintain an interested attitude. When guests have unreasonable demands, they should ask him if he can achieve the purpose of marriage. As for this and that, it can only be done after marriage. In this way, it will not break up other people's happy families, and they will maintain a noble personality. If every dance hostess can do as said above, then who can say that a dance hostess is not a good profession?</p>
<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Pear Garden of the Former Capital (140)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Right Vice Censor-in-Chief of the Ming Dynasty Actually Judged Wrongful Cases of the Yuan Dynasty</p>
<p>Several years ago, I saw the Shanxi Bangzi troupe perform the full version of "Six Days of Snow" in Beiping. Their plot has many differences from this. First, Bin'e's father is actually a Xiucai who is going to Beijing to take the imperial examination. Fearing that his weak daughter would be unattended at home alone, he sent E to the Cai family to be a child bride, and used a golden lock as a token. It is said that E was only fourteen or five years old and had not yet married Changzong. Also, the old Dan's lyrics said, "My child is so young, but she has such filial piety." I also saw a newspaper record Bin'e's deeds, saying that E was actually beheaded and died. After her death, it was proved that the county had been in drought for three years, and the tombstone was inscribed with the words "Filial Daughter Bin'e," not the words "Madam Cai" or "Cai Binshi." This is enough to prove that the word "married" is incorrect. Moreover, Zhang Lv'er's lust for Bin'e was also because she had not yet married Changzong, so he had bad intentions. Relatively speaking, it feels more plausible. Second, Zhang Lv'er was not only not a servant of the Cai family, but his mother was also not an employee of the Cai family. According to Jin Bangzi's performance, Cai's mother went out one day to collect debts. The debtor was forced and held a grudge in his heart. After paying the silver, he secretly hired several rogues to rob Cai's mother on the way. After they left, Zhang Lv'er and his mother, because their hometown was in famine, happened to be begging and passed by. Seeing a woman tied up by the road, they went forward to rescue her. Cai's mother, because they had saved her life, kept Lv'er and his mother in the house. Later, seeing that Lv'er was clever in doing things, she adopted him as an adopted son. The drama calls his mother Zhang Yanyan, which shows that his mother was indeed not an employee of the Cai family. Lv'er went from rags to riches and suddenly had evil thoughts. Moreover, he relied on his merit of saving Cai's mother's life, so he dared to act recklessly and wrongly. This also seems more plausible than a servant or a maid's son who has no reason to harbor evil thoughts and try to seize the master's wife and property. Third, since Lv'er has already succeeded in his treacherous plan and occupied the Cai family's property, he should also be like Zhao Da in "The Pot of Black Clay." Change his jacket and wear it to make the audience feel more resentful of him. And just changing into a gorgeous dress can show that he has already occupied the Cai family's property. In this way, it can also be consistent with the lyrics sung by Bin'e when she was beaten by the forbidden mother.</p>

<h3>Grain, Tapioca Flour Prices Fall with Movement, Factory Flour Still Stagnant</h3>
<p>Wheat Flour, Yesterday was Tomb-Sweeping Day, the first day of the holiday, and the trading of spot flour from this factory was dull. Although the southern and northern merchants were involved, they were only sporadic. The street's retail sales were also not as lively as before, because buying and selling were not enjoyable during the holiday, so the factory's offer price did not change much. The second grade still stood at 4 yuan and 4 jiao. On the tapioca flour market, after a period of stagnation the day before, many new arrivals wanted to sell, and buyers took advantage of this to suppress prices. Brands such as Lantern, Flower Basket, Double Eagle, and Cannon, etc., fell from 4 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen 3 li to 4 yuan 1 jiao in cash. Adding the unified tax and miscellaneous fees started to cause the movement of this product. It is said that the Northern Ocean merchant group and the street had large transactions. The price has fallen by several fen to 1 jiao compared to the previous time. The prices of new brands and old brands are slightly different. Wholesale customers can also get a slight discount. The future of the market is difficult to see, as it is in the sound of a surge in price.</p>
<p>Checking wheat flour imports and exports, 600 pieces came to Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday. Today, the 8th, 27,500 bags were transported to Tianjin, and 3,000 bags were loaded to Yantai.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 180 bags of wheat came to Shanghai from Qidong, and 30 bags of sesame also arrived.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Stops, Shops are Prepared</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of river rice from various groups only reached the 3rd number. The Che Lun [brand] from the Baozi Su Tong Group was more than 1,600 bags, and the Kunshan Group was more than 620 bags. The rice market will be closed for two days for the Spring Festival. The street shops have made some preparations. However, many stockholders are waiting and watching, so the result is that the market, except for the cheap prices in the middle segment yesterday and a few parts of the river cargo that were shown, all of the original packaged high-priced goods are settled. Du Yang Jian Bu Jian and Bian Yuan are still holding to the original offer, with little ups and downs.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flowers, Cotton Yarn Piece Goods, Transported Separately to North and South Oceans</h3>
<p>Eight thousand exports, there are 1,130 pieces of cotton yarn, 145 pieces are transported north to Tianjin, then transported to Yantai, 635 pieces of those transported south are to Xiamen, 60 pieces are loaded to Hong Kong, and there are still 340 pieces of piece goods transported to Tianjin, 190 pieces transported to Xiamen, and 70 pieces loaded to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Different Opinions, Three Theories on the Future of the Yarn Market</h3>
<p>Can Be Compared with Today's Industry and Commerce Talk in This Newspaper</p>
<p>Due to the customs closure, the current yarn market is heard to be at a standstill, with no transactions. It is said that the market price of the Qingdao Stock Exchange is still rising. At present, there are three different opinions among people in the industry, each with its own merits. Let's see what happens later.</p>
<p>(A) It is said that the price of Japanese yarn has recently risen sharply, and the price of support yarn is almost equal to that of Chinese yarn. The price of cloth is even higher than that of Chinese cloth. Chinese yarn may be able to benefit from this and rise with the market.</p>
<p>(B) It is said that recently, the amount of yarn sold by factories has been very enthusiastic, and the financial community's hoarding of yarn is not very optimistic.</p>
<p>(C) It is said that the sources of cotton are as rare as phoenix feathers, and the inventory is exhausted. Fortunately, foreign cotton can be remedied from time to time, but the factory's costs have increased and the profits are less than before.</p>
<p>In short, with a strong enemy nearby, reversing the roles of guest and host, there is a great intention of "doing it all in one hand." The future fate of Chinese merchant yarn factories, even as stated in (A), is only begging for its leftover dregs, surrendering to others, losing the position of the master of the market. Even if profits are made, it is worse than making money from national disasters. What's more, people even have no intention of sharing this "leftover dreg". The two theories in (B) and (C) can be said to be that the yarn market has also suffered a fall.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Brass Wire Moves After Extreme Stillness</h3>
<p>Brass wire transactions at the end of last year, because sales were active, the market was strong. Therefore, the highest standard price once rose to more than 20 yuan. Recently, because spring factories, hardware factories, machine factories, etc. have stopped operating, the market situation is extremely deserted. Recently, because the Tianjin gang has been active in moving things, and spring factories, etc. have also started buying, the market situation has a trend of moving after extreme stillness. Although the prices have not increased, a kind of firmness has improved compared to the past. It is found that there are a total of more than 200 dans of idle goods in the city. The price of rough flowers is 18 yuan per dan, medium flowers are sold for 20 yuan, and fine flowers are opened for more than 21 yuan. It is said that these goods are opened by iron numbers in the North Suzhou Road area.</p>
<h3>Securities, British and French Loans Fall by Two and a Half Pounds</h3>
<p>London's Chinese foreign debt market, the British and French loans fell by two and a half pounds because they failed to pay interest as scheduled and were still ex-interest. The Chinese-French US Dollar (with seal) fell by one pound. Except for three or four kinds of flatness of the remaining various bonds, each fell by half a pound. Only the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway rose by .25.</p>
<h3>Medicinal Materials, Good Wilderness Sales are Active</h3>
<p>Liang [Medicine] is produced in Qiongya. Since the Japanese army invaded the south and transportation was blocked, some people have tried to detour, but the foreign expenses are huge and it is difficult to sell. Therefore, it has been cut off last year. The local demand only relies on the old inventory to supply. Recently, the Yangtze River merchants and others have come to purchase. A total of more than 400 packages have been traded. The large cover is 16 yuan per dan, the medium is only 22 yuan, and the small is 18 yuan. It is found that the inventory of Chahao is thinning, and if there are arrivals later, it will not be possible to read for three or four months. Kehao pan has been uniformly guarding.</p>
<p>People's Food Problem</p>
<h3>Recent Situation of the Grain Market</h3>
<p>— Chen Zi</p>
<p>Alarming Import of Foreign Flour, Wheat, and Rice: Total Value Reaches Seven to Eight Million Yuan</p>
<p>Mr. Zeng once submitted two articles titled "The Construction of the Shanghai Rice Industry in the Last Ten Years" to this newspaper in February. It is now the end of February, and the grain market situation in these two months has not been particularly noteworthy. However, the market price of japonica rice has gradually risen, reaching 1.23 yuan per stone, while indica and medium-grade rice have risen to 1.45 yuan. Upon investigation, around February 10th, although special-grade rice from the Changzhou region was limited to 14 yuan, the price of special-grade japonica rice could not be fixed, and only market japonica rice, which was previously sold at 12.67 yuan, was available. Yang indica rice is now sold at 3.89 yuan. In my opinion, the rice we eat daily should retain some of the bran, not be overly polished and whitened, to promote health. If this imperceptible improvement could be achieved due to the price limit, it would strengthen our bodies, improve the race, and save resources. Wouldn't that be wonderful? However, Shanghai is an area of luxury and refinement, and residents are accustomed to eating rice that is as clean as possible. If there is no specially cleaned rice, they will seek it out by offering higher prices. This is the origin of the over-the-limit black market. For the reference of those concerned about the people's food supply, I will describe the past and present situation, the future trend, the relationship between domestic rice and foreign rice, and the large-scale orders for foreign flour and wheat, as follows:</p>
<p>1. The Rise in Rice Prices</p>
<p>Since last winter to this spring, a certain country has been purchasing large quantities of rice in the Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces and transporting it for export through nearby ports, totaling no less than one million, several hundred thousand stones. This has led to a depletion of domestic goods in rural areas, and the price of rice has gradually risen. On March 7th and 8th, the price of Qing japonica rice in Wuxi rose to 13.56 yuan. Although the customs office established five collection points on February 1st to collect transit taxes, rice and wheat were not taxed according to regulations, and after the abolition of the avenue donation, an additional two yuan per bag, or 1.67 yuan per stone, was still required, bringing the price in Shanghai to over 15 yuan. The price of rice in Wuhu was over 2 yuan, bringing the price in Shanghai to 14 yuan. The certain country wanted to purchase rice in the mainland, but it was unable to do so. Therefore, the pseudo-organization, in addition to limiting the price in Wuxi to 11 yuan (at a time when the price in Wuxi had already risen to over 13 yuan, how could this be possible?), also stopped issuing removal permits and prohibited transportation. Soon after, the market price fell back by one yuan. Previously, colleagues in Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places had procured a total of 50,000 bags of rice and transported them to Hupu, intending to ship them to Shantou on British ships. However, the other side learned of this and prohibited the transportation. The rice had already arrived in Hupu and was ordered to be returned, later being successively transported to Shanghai for sale. With the sudden rise in market prices in the mainland, the 14-yuan price limit here could not be maintained. Therefore, the rice industry convened a meeting of representatives from rice shops, firms, and customers to decide that, since there were still large stockpiles, they should continue to maintain the original price limit. On the other hand, if the price of rice did not fall back, merchants would inevitably hoard goods, and once the stockpiles were exhausted, there was concern about panic. Therefore, they sent letters to the British and French authorities, urging them to take precautions, either by ordering foreign rice or using other methods, so that the supply would not be interrupted and they would not be caught off guard. This is the responsibility that the Grain Public Association should fulfill in suppressing market prices.</p>
<p>2. The Establishment of the Evaluation Committee</p>
<p>On March 10th, Mr. Ho Hua, the Chief of the Engineering Bureau of the British and Dutch Public Concession, telephoned Mr. Zhang Nianxuan from the rice shops, Mr. Zhu Zixiang and Mr. Fu Qiangeng from the rice firms, and me to discuss the rice market situation. Mr. Evertland, a Westerner from the Bureau's Grain Committee, was also present. He believed that it would be difficult to order foreign rice and cover the losses at present. If it was absolutely necessary, gradually raising the price would also be a way to attract supply. However, indiscriminate price increases would lead to market chaos, which would be undesirable. Therefore, he suggested establishing an Evaluation Committee, which the Bureau approved. On the 13th, a joint meeting of seven organizations, including the rice shops, the South Gang Public Association, the Chang Gang Public Association, the Rice Milling Industry Public Association, the River Goods Joint Association, and the Sales Public Association, was convened. The meeting decided to establish an Evaluation Committee, which was formally established on the 15th. The rice shops, firms, and customers each nominated five members, totaling fifteen, to formulate a charter, evaluate prices, and investigate the detailed numbers of all banks, warehouses, and rice shops in Shanghai, to calculate the quantity of arrival, sales, and inventory, and to observe the trend. However, if it became necessary to change the market price in the future, it would still be handled by the entire seven-organization committee. In other words, the Evaluation Committee only has the obligation to evaluate, investigate, and report, and does not have the power to change the market price.</p>
<p>3. The Current Market and Future Trends</p>
<p>Since Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places stopped issuing removal permits, and Wuhu stopped issuing tax payment slips, only those who had obtained permits in advance could transport rice. Those without permits could not purchase rice, so the market price immediately fell by one yuan. The current price of high-grade japonica rice in Wuxi is 12.45 yuan, equivalent to 14 yuan in Shanghai. The current price in Wuhu is 11 yuan, equivalent to 12.8 yuan in Shanghai. However, this is not always certain, as sometimes rice can be transported without removal permits, depending on the intentions of the parties involved. In January and February, apart from a small amount of purchases in Wuhu, the certain country stopped purchasing rice in the Jiangxi and Zhejiang provinces due to high prices. Shanghai was cheaper than the mainland, so purchases continued in the Shanghai market. They would buy when the market price fell and stop when it rose. Although there are no statistics, they have successively purchased about 100,000 bags, showing that they are not not buying, but waiting for an opportunity to sell. The investigation work of this Evaluation Committee is more detailed than before, so it has not yet been completed. In addition to sending specialists to investigate the number of banks, warehouses, and rice shops one by one, and issuing investigation forms to be filled out at any time, so far, 16 banks and warehouses have been found, with a total of 320,000 bags of rice. There are about 90 rice shops, but the quantity is very scattered. The detailed numbers are still being investigated. The overall estimate is also over 300,000 bags. In total, there are 700,000 bags, equivalent to about 900,000 stones, which can supply three months. Although the supply is not abundant, merchants seek profits like water flowing downhill. As long as the calculations do not lead to losses, transportation can still be sustained. Based on the current prices in Jiangsu and Anhui, if transportation is smooth, the price in Shanghai can be reasonable. For the sake of the entire society, it seems unnecessary to raise the original price limit at present. However, the rice shops have bought rice from the firms at 14 yuan, and must add all expenses and profits, so it is reasonable to increase the price by 40 cents from April 1st. Otherwise, they can sacrifice profits in the short term, but cannot continue to subsidize in the long term.</p>
<p>4. Foreign Rice Prices Gradually Converge</p>
<p>As domestic rice prices gradually rise, the price of foreign rice from Yangon is also rising by more than one yuan due to purchases from various places and North China. However, there is a possibility of gradual convergence. For example, Saigon rice in the Shanghai market sells for 17 yuan per bag, equivalent to 14 yuan per stone. Small-size rice sells for 15.8 yuan per bag, equivalent to between 13.1 yuan per stone. The latest quotation from Saigon is about 18.7 yuan per bag, equivalent to about 15.12 yuan per stone including all expenses. If domestic rice rises by another yuan, people will start ordering foreign rice. Therefore, the rise and fall of domestic and foreign rice prices are closely related, and those in the industry cannot ignore this. It is reported that Tianjin has ordered a total of 500,000 bags of foreign rice, one-third of which has arrived, and the rest will arrive successively next month. Small-size rice is priced at 12.5 yuan, equivalent to 16.67 yuan per stone. Adding the Tianjin expenses, the lowest price in Tianjin is 17.4 yuan, based on an exchange rate of 87. The current market price is as high as 20 yuan, with substantial profits. Therefore, only Tianjin can currently purchase foreign rice, with a total value of about 10 million yuan. If the price here rises excessively, or if domestic and foreign prices are high and goods are scarce, then foreign rice will undoubtedly be used. However, with this safeguard, we will definitely not repeat the past mistakes of soaring prices. Shanghai residents can rest assured that there will be rice to cook. "In May of the 26th year, the central government promulgated the third item of the Food Regulation Measures. If there is a shortage of domestic food, it is necessary to import duty-free or reduced-tax foreign rice and wheat to regulate the market. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Agricultural Bank, or the Food Transportation and Sales Bureau should be responsible for purchasing and transporting the food after it has been approved by the Executive Yuan. Merchants are not allowed to purchase and transport the food freely to prevent abuses." Therefore, the Shanghai Customs' duty-free import of foreign rice and wheat has not been approved by the government. Recently, Guangdong, Chaozhou, Meizhou, Fujian, Zhejiang, and other places have requested duty-free import of foreign rice, but the Ministry of Finance has rejected them one by one and instructed the finance departments of Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang provinces to comply with the regulations. At a time when the country's economy is at war and foreign exchange is striving for balance, this issue is indeed quite serious. Now, I will describe the surprisingly large quantities of foreign wheat and flour ordered in detail below:</p>
<p>5. The Alarming Orders for Foreign Flour and Wheat</p>
<p>Our country's wheat production is insufficient and has never been widely used. Since the start of the War of Resistance, transportation has been obstructed, and taxes and fees have been piled up, making the situation even more difficult. Normally, the shortage would only be felt in March or April of the following year, but last year, the shortage was felt as early as winter. In addition, there was a poor harvest in the Northeast and North China last year (Harbin's wheat production was particularly abundant, but last year it was only 30%). Therefore, flour from Shanghai sold particularly well in the north. From November 16th of last year, the Zhongfen Flour Factory initially ordered American wheat, but later switched to Australian wheat because it was cheaper and of better quality. As of March 18th of this year, it had ordered a total of 23 ships of Australian wheat and 8.5 ships of American wheat (including 2 ships of Australian wheat for the Tianjin factory, 1 ship of Australian wheat for the Qingdao factory, and 2 ships of Australian wheat and 0.5 ships of American wheat for the colleagues and the Ningbo factory). Each ship is calculated at 8,000 tons, totaling 252,000 tons, equivalent to 4,233,600 dan. The price is calculated at 7.8 yuan per dan, totaling over 33 million yuan. The price of Australian wheat ranged from a high of 8.1 yuan to a low of 7.37 yuan, and the price of American wheat ranged from a high of 8.04 yuan to a low of 6.75 yuan. Excluding the wheat that has already been milled into flour, the stock in the factories and the wheat that has not yet arrived is enough for about three months. Last winter, many production areas suffered from floods and were unable to plant seeds, so this year's production will definitely be greatly reduced. In addition, after the flour factories in the guerrilla areas were occupied, there have been signs of resumption of work. With the brisk sales of Shanghai flour in the north, it will be difficult to stop the continued purchase of foreign wheat.</p>
<p>Tianjin is a gathering area for North China and the flour market. In addition to the local flour production and the sales of Shanghai and Japanese flour, the supply is still insufficient. Therefore, since October of last year to the present, direct orders for foreign flour have been very large. Shanghai grain merchants have also followed suit in ordering, but the quantity is not as large as Tianjin's, and 70-80% is resold to the north. The numbers are listed below:</p>
<p>Tianjin: 5,500,000 bags ordered.</p>
<p>Shanghai: 1,600,000 bags ordered.</p>
<p>Yantai: Over 100,000 bags ordered.</p>
<p>Australian flour accounts for one-third of the above, and American flour accounts for two-thirds (American flour is less glutinous than Australian flour). Japanese flour is not included. The price is estimated at about 4 yuan per bag, totaling over 30 million yuan. About 1 million bags have arrived and been sold in Tianjin, and the rest will arrive successively next month. About 500,000-600,000 bags have arrived in Shanghai, and most will arrive next month. Sales are brisk in Tianjin and Shanghai, and there is not much stock. Before the arrival of foreign wheat, the price of foreign flour was 20-30 cents higher than that of Chinese flour. Now, the flour produced in Shanghai factories, using foreign wheat as raw material, is of comparable quality to foreign flour, so the price in Tianjin and Shanghai is the same as that of Chinese flour. Recently, the price in Tianjin is 5.2 yuan, with Australian flour selling for 10-20 cents more, with a low of 4.85 yuan. The highest price in the central market is 5.1 yuan, with a low of 4.15 yuan. Previously, the highest price of domestic flour was 4.9 yuan, and now the lowest price is 4.4 yuan. The current price of domestic wheat is about 7 yuan per 100 jin, while the price of foreign wheat is only 6.5-6.6 yuan per 100 jin, and the price can still rise by 20-30 cents compared to domestic wheat. Therefore, everyone is happy to purchase foreign wheat, which is due to the inconvenience of foreign exchange. In the future, foreign wheat will definitely be purchased locally when it arrives in Shanghai. In summary, the total value of the ordered foreign rice, wheat, and flour is as high as 70-80 million yuan. The future is still uncertain, and who knows where it will end. This is a deep concern for those who worry about foreign exchange during wartime.</p>
<p>Discussions on Industry and Commerce</p>
<h3>Hidden Worries About the Future of Yarn and Cloth</h3>
<p>— Long Ju Sheng</p>
<p>It is heartbreaking to say that we have abundant raw materials in our own country, but we let others enjoy them, and we have to rely on foreign countries. What a sad thing! We know that before the war, most of the spinning raw materials used by Chinese yarn factories (about one-third or more) were purchased from domestic cotton. For spinning coarse yarn of 10-16 counts, they were purchased from Donggou, Beixinjing, Taicang, Xiasha, and other cotton-producing areas. For spinning 20 counts, they used Hankou fine velvet cotton, Tongzhou, Tianjin coarse velvet cotton, and other cottons. For spinning fine yarn of 32-42 counts, they used Tianjin American cotton, Shandong American cotton, Shanglingbao, Zhengzhou, and other cottons. It was truly an inexhaustible supply. Since the outbreak of the Japanese war of aggression, the raw material areas have mostly fallen into enemy hands due to military changes. (From a military point of view, the loss of one city or one place is not related to the overall situation, but from a commercial point of view, it has a profound impact.) Some were violently plundered, some were controlled by the Japanese and puppet regimes, and some were blocked by the war. The Chinese yarn factories in the special zone, which were barely surviving, had no choice but to reluctantly purchase foreign cotton in the embarrassing situation of having no goods to buy. Foreign cotton was also subject to foreign exchange restrictions, and the cost of flowers was increased due to taxes, water freight, insurance, warehouse rent, and other burdens. Profits were dwindling, while the extremely high profits were forcibly exploited by the enemy. I remember that in the golden age of the yarn market last autumn, the price of 20-count standard yarn reached a new record high of about 510 yuan per piece in the national currency. At that time, it was still possible to purchase domestic cotton as raw material, so the average profit per piece of yarn reached more than 150 yuan. Now, after switching to foreign cotton, for example, American Metering cotton for 20-count raw material requires 82.9 yuan per dan, and Indian white Lo cotton requires 72.1 yuan. The total cost is about 80 yuan. Calculating 350 jin of flowers per piece of yarn, the flower cost alone is 280 yuan. Adding about 40 yuan for operating expenses (calculated for spinning 20 counts), some manufacturers' operating expenses may require 45 yuan. The operating expenses include about 20 yuan for manufacturing costs, 15 yuan for management and operating expenses, and 5-6 yuan for financial expenses. The total cost per piece of yarn is 320-330 yuan. Now the market sells for 380-390 yuan, and each piece of yarn can earn about 60-70 yuan. If the market price jumps to 500 yuan again, the price of foreign cotton will not only follow, but it will also be difficult to purchase. The temporary profit of the Chinese yarn factories on the isolated island in the past was like a flash in the pan. Moreover, the dumping area of ​​Japanese yarn and cloth is becoming wider and wider. Recently, the strong and high prices of goods in Dongbi and the gradual decadence of domestic cloth due to inconvenient transportation, the future of Chinese yarn factories may not be as optimistic as in the past!</p>
<h3>Scarcity of Marine Products and Mushrooms</h3>
<p>Fujian mushrooms are in high demand among various gangs due to poor production and reduced supply. The market price has risen frequently. It was found that the price opened on the previous day (4th) was 252.6 yuan per dan for Huabu mushrooms and 246 yuan for Jian mushrooms. There was news of continued sales yesterday. It was heard that Jian mushrooms already require 256 yuan, an increase of another 10 yuan.</p>
<h3>Import and Export: Palm-leaf Fans Shipped from Hong Kong</h3>
<p>Forty-three barrels of August tobacco leaves were shipped to Hong Kong and imported on the 7th. 1,095 pieces of palm-leaf fans and 320 pieces of tobacco leaves came from Hong Kong. 898 bags of sugar and 37 pieces of tobacco leaves also came from Shantou.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Sichuan Fungus Falls Again, Hoping to Rise</h3>
<p>Sichuan fungus has recently been transported here. Those who cannot hold out for long are selling at a loss. Therefore, the market situation has weakened again and fallen by nearly 10 yuan. Yesterday, it was heard that more than 100 packages of Sichuan fungus were opened, with a price of 192 yuan. However, the market price seems to have reached its limit. If the appetite increases, there is hope for recovery from adversity.</p>

<h3>Haiphong to Kunming</h3>
<p>— Xun</p>
<p>The train timetable and fares for the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway have been completely changed since March 15th of this year. The general situation of the railway has been described in the first issue of this publication. Now, according to the newly revised timetable, the itinerary of the railway's express and slow trains, as well as the accommodation conditions along the way, are recorded below:</p>
<p>Slow Train: To travel from Haiphong to Kunming by slow train, you need to change trains four times: From Haiphong to Hanoi on the first day, from Hanoi to Lao Cai on the second day, from Lao Cai to Kaiyuan on the third day, and from Kaiyuan to Kunming on the fourth day. If you want to shorten the trip and avoid spending the night in Hanoi, you can take the 6:03 am train from Haiphong to Gia Lam on the first day, and change trains from Gia Lam to Lao Cai at 9:03 am on the same day, and stay overnight at a hotel in Lao Cai. There are several hotels in the area, such as Tianran and Xin Ya, with room rates ranging from 1.5 to 3 Vietnamese dollars per day, including meals. The hotel can handle the procedures for baggage handling and passport signing. Depart from Lao Cai at 6:26 am on the second day and arrive in Kaiyuan (also known as Amizhou) at 6:23 pm on the same day. There are railway hotels, Shaoan, and Dadong hotels in the area for accommodation. The room rate is about 7 Yunnan dollars (equivalent to 3.5 national dollars) per day. Depart from Kaiyuan at 6:36 am on the third day and arrive in Kunming at 4:49 pm on the same day. Passengers on slow trains are allowed to carry 30 kilograms of free baggage per person. Overweight baggage is charged about 33 Vietnamese dollars per 100 kilograms. Baggage can be delivered directly to Kunming with a station tag to avoid inspection along the way; it should be sent one day before departure so that it can arrive in Kunming at the same time as the passenger. Passengers entering the country at the Haikou Border Defense Commissioner's Office must check their transit passports and identity certificates. At the same time, customs must also check their baggage. Passengers purchasing a fourth-class through ticket to Kunming must change trains in Gia Lam to Lao Cai (cannot pass through Hanoi). Passengers must take care of their own baggage and take care of themselves when getting on and off the train. The station is not responsible for the safety of the baggage. The baggage must also be checked in Haikou. However, the baggage transportation fee is more expensive, and each 100 kilograms of overweight baggage is charged more than 16 yuan.</p>
<p>Express Train: The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway express train is a general term that includes the following three sections of travel:</p>
<p>(1) Haiphong-Hanoi section of the special express train (Autorails)</p>
<p>(2) Hanoi-Lao Cai section of the night express train (Train de Nuit)</p>
<p>(3) Dumai (a station before Lao Cai, only 2.2 kilometers away from Lao Cai and only 8 minutes away) Kunming section of the Michelin express train (Michelin)</p>
<p>First, take the special express train from Haiphong to Hanoi. There are five express trains every day, departing at 7:17 am, 8:46 am, 1:16 pm, 5:47 pm, and 9:46 pm. The train takes only 2 hours to reach its destination. After arriving in Hanoi, you can transfer to the night express train departing from Hanoi at 8:30 pm to Lao Cai. This train runs only twice a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. It has sleeping cars, but only first and second class have sleeping berths. There is no sleeping berth in the third class. First-class A is 6 Vietnamese dollars per person, which is similar to the first-class equipment on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. First-class B is not much different from first-class A, but foreigners are not allowed to ride. It is 4.5 Vietnamese dollars per person. The second-class sleeper is the Pullman type, and it is not divided into rooms, but separated by curtains. It is 2 Vietnamese dollars per person. Passengers can purchase sleeping car tickets separately and sleep on the train, arriving at Dumai at 5:25 the next morning. Get off here and have breakfast at the small cafeteria in front of the platform. Connect to the Michelin express train at 6:05 am, pass Lao Cai at 6:12 am, and arrive in Haikou at 6:13 am. The Hanoi Border Defense Commissioner's Office will check everything. After the inspection is completed, the train will depart and arrive in Kaiyuan at 12:07 pm. Get off here for lunch (because there is no meal on the train). The original train will continue to depart at 1 pm and arrive in Kunming at 6:46 pm that evening. The entire journey takes only one night, but if the inspection of passports, certificates, and baggage in Haikou takes too long, the train will be delayed. It is also found that the Michelin car has limited seats. The one departing from Dumai on Wednesday has only 15 first-class seats, and the one on Saturday has 18 first-class seats and 19 third-class seats. Those who reserve a seat on this train must pay a registration fee of 2.5 Vietnamese dollars for first class and 1 yuan for third class. Once the reservation is confirmed, the ticket cannot be refunded or rescheduled. The baggage limit and overweight charges are the same as those for slow trains, but the tag should be sent three or four days before departure, otherwise it will not be able to arrive at the same time as the passenger. When riding the Michelin car, each person is only allowed to carry 15 kilograms of carry-on baggage.</p>
<p>The one-way through ticket price from Haiphong to Kunming is the same for express and slow trains: 78.1 Vietnamese dollars for first class, 53.2 Vietnamese dollars for second class, 30.55 Vietnamese dollars for third class, and 11.1 Vietnamese dollars for fourth class. If converted to national currency, first class is 132.6 yuan, second class is 50.44 yuan, third class is 51.94 yuan, and fourth class is 18.87 yuan. (If you buy a round-trip ticket, the validity period is 35 days.)</p>
<h3>China Motor Company Expanding Showroom</h3>
<p>The business of China Motor Company at 702 Jing'an Temple Road has been booming in recent years, so the original showroom has gradually become insufficient. The company began to renovate the showroom last month and greatly expanded it. It has now been completed, and the area is 50% larger than the original area. According to the company, it has expanded the showroom once several years ago, and this is the second time in order to meet business needs. As for the repair department, it is still in the same place as the showroom, but in the future, vehicles will generally enter and exit from Baker Road. The company has recently received a batch of new Dodge cars, which have now been displayed in the new showroom after the expansion, creating a new atmosphere and complementing each other even more.</p>

<h3>Important News from the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway</h3>
<p>— Que</p>
<p>Revised Train Schedule, Increased Freight Capacity</p>
<p>According to a report from Haiphong, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway's train schedule was fully revised on March 15. Furthermore, passengers traveling to the interior of China via Haiphong and the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway who wish to take the Michelin express train must have formal tickets and reserve seats in advance. Due to the large number of passengers and the limited number of seats, reservations must be made one week in advance. Round-trip tickets are available, valid for 35 days. Extensions of 15 days can be obtained by paying an additional 10% of the round-trip fare. For an extension of up to 35 days, an additional 20% of the round-trip fare is required; tickets expire after this period.</p>
<p>Before February, the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway's freight capacity was only 4,000 to 5,000 tons per month, resulting in a backlog of over 80,000 tons of goods awaiting transport to the interior in Haiphong. Through active improvements by the railway bureau, the transport capacity has increased from 4,000 to 5,000 tons per month to 9,000 tons per month, and will soon reach 12,000 tons. The current backlog in Haiphong has been reduced to over 50,000 tons. With sufficient time, the backlog will be significantly reduced, greatly benefiting freight transport. China Travel Service previously suspended acceptance of freight for transport to the interior via Haiphong due to the excessive accumulation of goods. Through recent efforts, most of the freight stored in Haiphong by the company has been shipped out. As of early March, there were still approximately 800 tons remaining, which are expected to be cleared by the end of April. It is rumored that the company may resume accepting freight for customers from the middle of next month.</p>

<h3>Hotel Prospects</h3>
<p>— Ye Yuanjie</p>
<p>Hotels are closely related to transportation, as anyone paying attention to the highway business knows. I have translated "Hotel Prospects" for publication in this newspaper to fill a gap and provide a reference for hotel operators in our country.</p>
<p>1.  Comfortable hotels indirectly help increase railway business.</p>
<p>2.  Hotel business in Mexico City has become more developed since the construction of good highways.</p>
<p>3.  A good hotel is not about luxurious facilities but about maintaining quiet order and avoiding noise.</p>
<p>4.  Country hotels that focus on improving their meals can attract more travelers and increase their profits.</p>
<p>5.  Modern hotel designs often use a crescent shape, with the lobby in the center of the building and rooms on either side to maximize sunlight, hence the name "Sunshine Hotel."</p>
<p>6.  It is said that American hotel rooms are showcases for everything, including tablecloths, curtains, carpets, paint, wallpaper, radios, modern sanitary equipment, decorations, and furniture.</p>
<p>7.  Airlines are promoting the comfort of "sleeping in the sky" and plan to develop a new business of "soaring hotels" in the air.</p>
<p>8.  Cigarette butts are the enemy of hotels because they can damage everything.</p>
<p>9.  To develop a successful hotel business, honesty, willingness to serve, and well-trained staff are essential.</p>
<p>10. The cleanliness of tablecloths and tea cloths is the first thing travelers see upon entering, so attention must be paid to create a good impression.</p>
<p>11. In 1937, there were approximately 20,000 registered hotels in the United States, with total assets of US$5 trillion, a remarkable level of development.</p>
<h3>Travel Knowledge (2)</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>Traveling by Highway Bus</p>
<p>(1) Highway buses travel through areas with heavy dust and sand, which can easily penetrate and damage luggage. Moreover, there is often heavy rain, which can cause further damage if luggage is not properly protected. Therefore, passengers traveling by highway bus must wrap their luggage tightly with large tarpaulins (or other waterproof materials) to prevent damage from sand and rain. (2) The heavy dust and sand not only contaminate luggage but also easily penetrate clothing around the neck. A hat is essential, and a large towel or scarf should be used to tightly wrap the neck. (3) Passengers departing from Kunming by highway bus should deliver their luggage to the station the day before purchasing tickets to ensure it is transported on the same bus. Otherwise, the luggage will not be transported on the same bus, causing much trouble. (4) Passengers should bring their own bedding for overnight stays at small stations, as the bedding in ordinary small-station inns is often filthy and infested with bedbugs and lice. (5) If possible, bring a small cushion to place on the seat for comfort and to reduce fatigue. (6) If prone to motion sickness, it is best to eat sparingly. Acidic fruits are particularly suitable.</p>
<h3>Travel Inquiries</h3>
<p>Local resident Mr. Yu Ancheng asks about the route and travel expenses from Shanghai to Chongqing via eastern Zhejiang and Vietnam.</p>
