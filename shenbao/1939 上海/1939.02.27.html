<h3>全般戰局　迄無變化</h3>
<p>（香港）全般戰局二十五晚止無變化、各地日軍調動甚忙、晋西華軍圍攻夏縣、頗有斬獲、鄆城日軍圖西犯、華軍已嚴防、蠡縣日軍五百餘、二十四日攻陷宋崗、刻激戰中、日軍有再犯肅寗企圖、鄂中華日兩軍在天門京山附近相持、局部戰仍激烈、津浦綫日軍近將糧秣軍用品運集徐州、圖西犯、南潯綫日軍强拉民夫修路、圖犯南昌、華方在各該錢已嚴密防範、冀平華游擊隊反攻得手、情况轉穩、（廿六日專電）</p>

<p>（福州）二十五日午有日機三架、自粵飛察沿海各地、閩東南二十餘縣、均發空襲警報、日機於二時許、折向南飛、降落厦海、（二十五日電）</p>
<h3>日空軍　損失慘重</h3>
<p>一年半之中損失千餘架</p>
<p>某地　空軍發言人向記者稱、據日軍大本營廿八年一月卄日公佈、自侵華戰爭開始以來、截至廿七年十二月卅日爲止、損失陸海軍飛機共七百十架、另有損失不堪使用者三百架、併計一千零十架、核與華方之結果統計數字適相符合、計被華空軍在空中擊落者二二一架、被華空軍炸燬者一七九架、被華高射砲隊擊落者八十三架、被華陸軍襲擊燬壞者一零七架、被華砲兵擊燬者十一架、日機自行迫降者一九架、被華軍擊落而行方不明者、或受重傷迫降日陣地者二七架、共計六四七架、再加其飛行失事之最低損失率估計的爲三六三架、（實際數字必不止此）總計一零一零架、平均每月損失五十六架以上、可謂損失慘重矣、廿八年元旦以來、被華空軍擊落炸燬者、及高射砲與陸軍部隊擊落者已達二十四架、其中以華英勇空軍戰士、在蘭州上空擊落新近購自歐西之最新式精銳重轟炸機十五架、實予日空軍以嚴重之打擊、（廿六日電）</p>
<h3>日本軍部自認空襲蘭州失敗</h3>
<p>（東京）據日軍部發言人談、日方在本月二十三日之第三度蘭州空襲、成績不佳、日機之被擊落者、計有三架、並損失空軍將士十八人、另有一機、雖能飛返艮據地、但機身已中一百五十三彈、故已成爲廢機、至華方之損失、則以各方之報吿、尙有「矛盾」、須經「整理」、方可公佈云、（二十六日快訊社電）</p>
<p>（北平）日軍發言人昨日在招待外籍新聞記者席上、承認本月二十三日、日機空襲蘭州時、損失轟炸機三架、飛行員十八名、該發言人繼稱、其餘飛返根據地之日機、均中彈多發、故有日飛行員九名受傷、（二十六日快訊社電）</p>
<h3>綏日軍實力單薄</h3>
<p>懼華方游擊隊襲擊</p>
<p>勒令各村居民遷移</p>
<p>河曲　歸綏來人談、綏市日軍實力現極空虛、時懼華游擊隊襲擊、各偏僻巷口均堆置沙袋、阻碍交通、僅於通衢耍隘設防扼守、舊城鼓樓上設有播音機一具、城郊十數里村莊內、各設一通訊員、遇有警變、立卽舉燈爲號、由播音機報吿與兩城軍民、急速戒備、日軍以兵力不敷分布、所有日鮮籍商人、畫間營業，入夜卽編爲警戒隊、日方以軍費拮据、月前曾召集編减會議將蒙偽軍大加裁編、德王與李逆守信兩部、雖號稱十師、實際的僅數千人、經會議裁編後、益爲减少、並令蒙偽軍單獨編制、不得相混聯系、誠恐實力龐大、難以統馭、德·李·兩逆及蒙僞軍、對日方此種設施、甚爲不滿、時有發生異動可能、各縣所駐日軍、實力亦極薄弱、雖不時調遺移動、似增防補充、實則係炫惑伎倆難撞空虛恐惶之象，其在政治上、最高偽組織雖爲蒙聯自治政府、及省府、德王爲傀儡、然另設歸綏公府、純由日人操縱行政實權、前者日方利用各縣士紳所組織之僞縣府及警察署、近均已撤換、改由其親信漢奸接替、此可謂狡兔死、走狗烹、足爲一般投機漢奸之股鑒、因華方游擊隊潛伏各縣城郊、日之政令、現仍難出城門、一籌莫展、近數月來、日軍曾兩度大舉包圍大靑山、圖將華游擊軍根據地摧毀、然卒未能如願以償、故近復變本加厲，驅令平綏沿綫及公路兩旁各村居民、向日軍所指定之區域遷移、違令不移者、卽行屠殺、意欲堅壁淸野、以控制華游擊軍潛伏活動、日軍此種窮極無聊之舉動、枉費苦心、對於華軍畢竟仍屬莫可奈何也、（二十四日電）</p>
<h3>焦作日軍　逃竄博愛</h3>
<p>（洛陽）前方電話、二十四晨十時、焦作日軍步兵三百餘、山砲三門、向博愛竄去、經柏岳村（博愛東二十餘里）時、被華當地駐軍截擊、殺日軍數十人奪獲輕機槍三挺、步槍十餘支、殘餘日軍狼狽向博愛南關逃竄、（廿六日電）</p>
<h3>鄂中日軍　西犯目的</h3>
<p>鞏固應皂綫防華軍反攻</p>
<p>伺隙進擾乃係游擊性質</p>
<p>鐘祥　鄂中日軍此决西犯、其目的在支撐平漢南部之警衛錢、鞏固應皂防守各據點、防華軍反攻、近雖不斷派少數部隊伺隙進擾、亦係遊擊性質、遇華軍迎擊、卽行退去、刻右翼前錢仍在岳口下廠集附近對峙中、（二十六日電）</p>
<p>常德　華容電話、華游擊隊某部、於日前在距朱河口的十五里之某處、與日兵遭遇、發生激戰、當時因日衆華寡、華軍立卽分散、隱伏於附近各村、旋得友軍協助、同時由各地出動、將該股日兵包圍痛剿、斬獲頗多、殘餘日軍潰不成軍、狼狽逃回白螺磯、又由白螺磯竄擾華確木橋之日軍、亦被華監利自衛團隊擊退、（二十六日電）</p>
<p>（重慶）漢宜公路戰事、二十三日又趨激烈日軍雖已獲有相當進展、但其付出之代價頗爲重大、此間華方軍界人士、對於該方面之戰事、並不重視、認日軍决無西犯宜昌沙市之能力、據稱日軍現分三路進犯、惟每路不過三數百人、其目的僅在壓迫鄂中之華方游擊隊西退以减除武漢之威脅也、目下中日兩軍激戰地點、共有三處、一在京山以北之三陽店、一在京山西南之南山廟靑龍山一帶、一在岳口附近、華軍有力部隊、昨自分水嶺向南出擊、經三小時之激戰後、克復皂市以西之錢家塲、切斷瓦廟集日軍後路、另有華軍一隊、現正自鄭家灘北進、反攻天門、並威脅岳口日軍側背、（二十六日快訊社電）</p>
<h3>喜多所提求和之「夢」　渝官塲從未考慮</h3>
<p>日人擬利用偽造之「三民主義」</p>
<p>喜多和平計劃已非新奇事件</p>
<p>（重慶）自重慶方面接獲喜多所提出之和平計劃後、各方多表示諷刺嘲笑、及極度輕蔑之態度、對於日本研究有素之官員、發出如下之評論、（一）日本採用孫中山先生之三民主義、表示日本在精神上對華屈服、卽平沼及坂垣亦公開在國會中討論三民主義問題、可見日人正在考慮利用三民主義、並重行加以解釋、惟華人必無相信日人所製造之「三民主義一者、（二）喜多身爲北平特務機關之領袖、爲日本軍官公開擬定和平程序之第一人、東京方面早有求和之意、當初曾由北平傀儡出面呼籲和平、毫無結果、目下日人對於和平事件、巳「急不能待」、是以乃親自提出和平、（三）汪精衛雖有趨向和平之意、唯國民黨人士以爲渠必不至參加南京之所謂國民黨政府、（四）所謂邀請蔣介石參加南京政權者、乃係「對中國之絕對侮辱、中國及華人决不考慮接受此種侮辱」、（五）據未瞪實之報吿、喜多自戰事發生之初、卽反對準備對華作戰、是以曾努力阻止上海事件之爆發、唯結果失敗、喜多之夫人爲華人、是以渠對於中國事件頗爲明瞭、渠個人亦善作華文、東京方面選之爲求和之人、實係一種成功、惟日方新和平計劃之錯誤、乃不知華人不易被假國民黨及重行解釋之三民主義所欺騙也（六）重慶方面不但未考慮喜多之「夢」、中國之研究日本專家、數月來卽已警吿全國民衆、謂日方陰謀組織新國民黨、是以喜多之和平計劃在重慶人士之眼中、已非新奇之事、（廿六日美聯社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>西班牙內戰結束</h3>
<p>今日將爲世界歷史上値得稱述之一日</p>
<p>英法兩國政府將於今日同時宣佈承認西班牙國民軍政府爲西班牙國之合法政府。西班牙共和政府之外交部長台爾伐育氏隔昨赴法，晋謁作客巴黎之西班牙共和政府總統亞查那氏，報告共和政府內閣會議已决定接受英法兩國之勸告，停止戰爭；亞查那氏亦决於英法宣布承認國民軍政府之際，宣布辭職下野。西班牙內戰，至是結束，此次西班牙內戰，歷時三十一月有餘；影響所及：不但西班牙一國之國運，因是而轉變至於另一階段；抑且使歐西全局，地中海狀態，因西國內戰而動盪，而艱危，造成國際戰爭之重耍酵母，而推進國際至於和戰分水嶺之最高峯；此後英法與德義國勢之消長，民治與獨裁分野之消長，以和平維持國際現狀與以武力變更國際現狀之國際政治思想之消長，我人初不必參雜絲毫主觀而論其短長，別其好惡，辨其利害，斷其歸宿，然終必有所消長而逈殊於曩昔者，固亦以此决西班牙內戰爲醞釀或消或長之機樞焉。夫影響深酷若此，曠日持久如彼，則結束內戰之今日，固爲史家畫時期之標幟。回憶過去卅一月，關於戰訉，報不絕書；改觀頻數，殆難悉記，顧爲近世一大事也，未可視如過眼雲烟；爲試的略述其輪廓，倘讀者不以爲辭費乎。</p>
<p>一九三六年七月十七日，西班牙共和國之菲洲屬地摩洛哥北部，地中海濱，美列拉地方，駐軍發難，此爲西班牙內戰之始。當時國家元首，即今日决定下野之總統亞查那氏；當時叛軍首領，卽今日取得英法諸國承認爲西班牙國合法政府之領袖弗朗哥將軍。先五日，極右派領袖政家保王黨索台洛氏遭暗殺，政府復大索右派人士，內戰導火綫，實繫於此。原來西班牙政治，久已杌隍，左右兩翼，積不相能；左派之人民陣綫雖掌政，然其物望不足鎭懾全國；故一隅發端，四方響應，而卒爲所傾覆者，事因錯綜，顧其本身脆弱特甚，是不可諱也。任何國家以內爭而內戰，史實綦多，兄弟鬩牆，成王敗寇而已，顧非所語於西班牙。西班牙內戰開始之日，國際即已騷然。蓋西班牙在歐洲各國之中，初非强盛，祗以地理關係，頗可舉足重輕，於是爭霸歐洲者，皆爭西班牙爲己用；彼國政豪，遂亦得各結外援。故在平時，鈎心鬥角，馬跡蛛絲，旣不能自掩其國際背景；一朝短兵相接，允圖窮而七見矣。時距摩洛哥發難不足半月，即傳義大利軍用飛機參加國民軍；當時羅馬雖吾認之，然略識國際情况者，固已斷言於其必不誣。德義沆瀣一氣，英法蘇俄諸國則意在袒護共和政府而與德義對峙。各國國會之中，對秉所信而公然對於西班牙內戰之雙方作左右袒。故流血三十一月，雖日一國之內戰，然歐洲國際之縮影不啻也。</p>
<p>間接之暗鬥，漸成露骨之對壘；其未致擴大蔓延而爲世界第二决大戰者，固問不容髮者也。是年八月八月一日，法國政府向英義兩國建議，對西班牙內亂，各國務守中立；爾虞我詐，波折橫生，經月始漸就緒，至九月九日，不干涉西班牙內戰問題國際調整委員會舉行首决會議，參加者二十六國。自此之後，中心誠其事者，或封鎖邊界，或禁止人民赴西投軍，或禁止軍火運往西班牙，終成西班牙共和政府戰敗之主要因素。其他始則陽奉陰違，繼則悍然背信，志願兵與飛機大砲絡繹於途，終成西班牙國民軍戰勝之主要後盾。閱三十一月而有今日之結局者，謂非調整委員會名存實亡所致，不可得也。雖然，調整委員會亦旣有莫大之功效；誠非有調委會之組織，减少摩擦於始，一再緩衝其間，必且相迫而共入漩渦；則西班牙境內兩軍之勝敗利鈍，雖不同於今日，而整個國際之爲狀，亦非今日所得想像者矣。</p>
<p>西班牙內戰將結束，然其本身之發展未已也，國際緣是而生之演變未已也；或愈趨緊張，或漸見開朗，各有其可能，是有待事實爲答復、而不容逆覩者矣。</p>
<h3>公共租界工部局　對日覆文强硬</h3>
<p>日當局舉行會議</p>
<p>定今日再提照會</p>
<p>日方代表於數日前就恐怖暴舉事、向工部局提出抗議後、工部局總董樊克令、已於上星期六日以答覆致日當局、其內容雖未透露、惟聞措詞頗堅决、據同盟社消息、日本陸海軍與領署人員、昨日午後在旗艦「出雲」號上會商、歷三小時之久、預料日方於今日將另以牒文致局方、聞日方人員會談時、商妥之决議、將列入今日致送之牒文中、同時、公共租界各區之巡邏隊、賡續在雨中巡邏、搜查隊在外灘檢查浦東來人、而在西區之搜查隊自昨日侵晨起、檢查由西東駛之公共汽車、雖於畫間歡小時內、檢查稍寬、但聞彼等檢查至昨日深晚始舉、工務處苦力已在中區架置鐵絲網完畢、昨日復在成都路區封閉各里街、而在靜安寺區內亦已着手工作、界外馬路之毘速界外區者、亦將全部架置鐵絲網、藉以防杜不法份子入公共租界、此種對付恐怖案伴之戒備、前所未見、而允以西區戒備最爲嚴密、五日來偽方人員絕無一人遭謀殺者、</p>
<p>（東京）據日人方面消息、南京「維新政府」發言人宣稱、吾人今不得不對上海公共租界與英法船隻宣布「靜默的宣戰」彼等之行動、不外乎擴張租界、而以揚子江爲根據地、以助蔣介石政權、政府已調軍隊與民團駐於租界四周、以防恐怖的示威運動之繼續發生、如英法不重行考慮變更其關於援助蔣政權之態度、則吾人不稍猶豫、將認公共租界內之英法軍爲仇敵增云、該項消息又稱、上海日當局對於工部局所取之計畫、顯不滿意、稱之爲冷淡的計畫、其認工部局答覆日方之請求亦然、日當局今日正在舉行緊急會議、以期决定應付大局之最後步驟云、（二十六日路透電）</p>

<h3>身體不健康就會麻木不仁</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師</p>
<p>老實說：人類的繁榮，實不能離開生殖而生存，吾人欲為個人及國家謀幸福，那末我們對於生殖實宜公開討論，以達盡善盡美之境。野發米開化的民族，他們祗知道生殖，而不知道生殖的裹面有一愛的問題在內，我還可以說：生殖離開戀愛，就會麻木不仁，就會半身不遂，性的滿足，性的協調，纔可繁榮進化，這是無可否認的。</p>
<p>所以，欲謀在生殖中產生愛情，不得不研究愛的知慧，始能逹到一致的美境。</p>
<p>然而照事實而論，任憑你智慧怎樣精深，求愛的方法怎樣圓滑，若缺少健康的體魄，那好比無頭之蛇，何况愛情的來源，必須夫婦間共同協調，這幾點正需要充沛的精力方可成功。然欲逹到此種期望，男子在婚前必須守貞，性力不可濫用，一個人的精力，若果荒淫一時，能使主宰性慾的靑春腺提早衰老，生殖不能等等疾病，由是而生，從此即不能與妻子的情潮一致。</p>
<p>夫婦的結合是求愛為目的的，腎虧為阻碍對方情潮亢進的主要原因，致不能達到目的所以生殖與快感兩方面都一無收穫。</p>
<p>關於本症演變的程序，幾有一定的程序，在平時身體感覺虛弱而有夢遺及見色流精時，應該要特別留意，或局部的勃起力並無異樣，但必患腎虧症無欵。若再有不攝生或縱慾行為，就喪失了勃起力而完全陰萎了。現在醫學進步，對於本症已發明靑春腺內分泌劑，如德國出品之雄壯動物睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」，確為對症良藥，服後腦力清爽，精神振作，面色紅潤，食慾增進，性機能非常健全，絕無腎虧陰萎等病態，且能促進生殖機能，幫助性器發育，故該劑巳被無數中外醫家所推崇，樂為介紹於愛情淡薄的伉儷們，此誠科學之萬能也。</p>
<h3>遺精與神經衰弱的關係</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>遺精旣為誘致神經衰弱症最普通的原因。但遺精類多由自凟過度所致，故有自凟癖者。差不多都患這種毛病，因為自凟能够直接摧殘人體的靑春腺，使精關失其控制力。故越虧損的人。其遺精愈頻。遺精愈頻者身體愈急遽向衰弱之途邁進。假若不加治療，病勢如洪水之氾濫，腦，性，脊髓三神經系均有病態發現。抑有進者，蓋靑年正當發育之時。而一旦罹成此種可慮疾息，當然要影響其發育了。</p>
<p>故靑年一有遺精現象，應速治療，自凟尤宜戒絕。關於自凟矯正法，必須用清心寡慾的方法以提高自己的道德。須知自凟是最可恥而最可卑的行為，能沾純潔的心靈，而另一方面服以遺精特效藥「耐而斯遺精片」以止遺精，實為必要。蓋不僅在短時期內杜絕遺精，且睡眼安適，如同時再以「補體康」補之，則新陳代謝之機能促進，健腦旺神返者還童</p>

<h3>白濁妥速之根治</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士　黃仲昌</p>
<p>不論何病，治療貴宜神速，萬不可曠日持久，使病勢蔓延，坐成難治之局。余於淋病研究，垂數十年。當負笈美邦時，即注意此症之根治。深知淋菌一物，繁殖力之大，夐絕一般下等細菌，故宜趕速治療。庶幾不致發生他變。而在治療法上，不僅採取速治之方針，而且必須做到妥速兩字。換言之，不求霜烈之速愈，而求穩妥之速愈。蓋霸烈之速愈，每貽將來之大患。與失治相等。惟有妥速之速愈法，旣獲穩妥之治愈，又無因不良之副作用所遺之壞症，始可稱為盡善盡美之療法。</p>
<p>一般的白濁患者，在感染淋病兩週後，淋菌就流竄血中，雖在外表上祗見淋菌的症狀，但內部往往發生淋毒性攝護腺炎，畢丸炎，膀胱炎，以及女子輸卯管閉塞，其結果百分之九十以上，多有絕嗣之危險。因此淋病患老之必須採用盡善與盡美的療法，實為治淋必須之條件。</p>
<p>據各國學者及余多年來之經騐，惟行白血球之增加療法，及免疫抗毒治療，則可因血球之猛力噬菌，結果使淋菌無所遁形，能合以上之條件者，惟德國彼德博士所發明之「克淋儂」，始可當之無愧。此劑係用精粹之黃色素蛋白體混合製成。凡是急優性之淋病，如攝護腺炎，睪丸炎，關節炎，膀胱炎，前後尿道炎等。均可服「克淋儂」一藥以根治之。因凡上述種種淋病，服此藥後，可以發生非特異性之抗淋毒素，以向淋菌進攻，於是一切淋菌，即迅速治愈。永無再發之事。至於外用藥。以「抗淋水」為最。患者可按圖與說明書在家洗滌尿道。以清除粘膜上之淋菌。女子可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥。則奏功尤速。蓋惟有依此療法，剿滅淋菌，如風掃落葉與彼一般透膜殺菌，及雷有副作用之療法，實不可同日而語。此所以久博國際醫家之贊美也。（按「抗淋水」中西太和兩大樂房均售。）</p>

<p>— 姚菊巖醫師述</p>
<p>診所，寗波路丸號四川路口</p>
<h3>白濁的新决治！</h3>
<p>不能徒托空言　淋病是很難於根治的疾患，所以不能徒托空言，可以濟事。惟近來治寮淋病，早已睡棄一般陳腐之療法，而代以根據科學的寮法，例如一般人只認淋病是一種尿道病，此話共來已舊，因為淋病兩字，不論在中國和外國，其意義亦指是尿道間一種漓出液體的現象而得者。而不知此種說法，僅憑肉睙而得，所以前人醫治淋病，僅着重於尿道的局部，自不免短視，但後來因科學進步，知淋菌之侵入，雖多山尿道，而其發展，並不止於尿道，因淋菌善竄，旣多匿於組織之深部，又能走竄血液筋骨之內，故用局部手術治療，及透膜殺之療法，完全為隔靴搔癢，無濟於事的蠢舉。故現在一般進步之醫家，已不十分重視尿道療法。而視為次要之輔助療法。</p>
<p>內服藥之重視　淋病療法，各國專家，均認為德國靜電療法，功效最著，共電熱透射殺菌力，範圍甚大。旣能殺滅組織內之淋菌，復可掃滅尿道以內之深部淋菌。惟內服藥中之「克淋儂」亦久已為專家所重視。因此劑祋菌力，極為廣泛而深入，能一方配用靜電療法，則根除淋病，始有勝利之把握。此為近世淋病專家一致公認之特殊有效的療法　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起，每天送診二十號，每號僅取號金五角。</p>
<h3>治癆心得</h3>
<p>— 盛在强醫師</p>
<p>我人一旦不幸而為肺癆病所犯，則其人因過信肺病是一種死症，而先奪共反抗病魔之勇氣。反而使病勢日漸惡化。使醫治人失去應有的功效，實為可惜之事。我二十餘年中所親身經騐洽療過之癆病，何止千萬，苟非身體感到十小分不支，無不可治者，但其療法，亦因科學日在進步中，而時有驚人之進展，如德國　梅博士發明之一補肺拿爾一一藥，確可為每個癆病患省惟一有保讎之內服劑。凡久咳止吒血，盜　　漓，及一二三期共他種種之肺病症狀。皆可服治之，放「的肺拿兩」為一切肺系之唯一內服劑。</p>

<p>大陸報云、咋（二十五日）晚據本埠日方消息、載有牯嶺外僑四十七人之日軍其運輸艦、自九江駛出、明（二十七日）晨可抵上海、蓋日方巳得該艦之直接電訊報吿行止、苟無意外而使其遲延者、明晚（卽今晚）可在距吳淞不遠之處停泊、按該艦於星期四日侵晨</p>
<p>駛離九江　、當日泊南京、聞昨晚泊於江陰附近、昨晚此間得可靠消息、外僑五十五人、仍留牯嶺、彼等無論如何、決不離山、為防衛起見、彼等已集中於兩地、聞已將此兩地點所在詳細通知日當局、留山之外僑五十五人中、有八人殘廢、不能行動、大半年在七十以上、古稀老者、共佔十八人、又此五十五人中、美籍佔十二人、瑞典籍佔七人、彼等巳</p>
<p>離其寓所　而集中於美童學校、但該校乃在危險地位、因其距中政府建築物不足一百碼也、仍留牯嶺之英人三十七名、已離寓所而集中於距美童學校約一理半之某旅舍、九江之第三處集中營、設於美以美會村中之華人難民收容所、聞內有</p>
<p>貧苦華人　數百名、該所之成立、亦巳通知日方、此三處集中營、均有巨大之白色標識、與外國旗幟、聞是項標識在高空中清晰可見、難民收容所之負責者、為列佩醫師、渠稱將竭盡其所能為受共照顧之不幸者謀福利、牯嶺物品供給、暫無大問題、今貯有足供維持半載之米糧與罐頭物品、但肉類·蔬菜·與蛋類之供給、日趨短少、按前傳牯嶺外僑僅六十五人之說不確、　仍留該山者計五十五人、已撤退者四十七人、其總數達一百零二人也、</p>

<h3>日方增兵蘇北沿海　戰事即將爆發　宋季港等各口已被華軍封銷　沿港情勢緊張各輪營業淸淡</h3>
<p>自華軍精銳部隊、陸續調往蘇北通·如•崇·啟•海·各縣沿港佈防後、日方大為恐慌、連日在靑龍港·甫通天生港·一帶增派日軍六百餘名、並構築防禦工事、形勢甚為緊張、戰事即將爆發、沿江商業、亦驟然清淡、茲經現代社記者探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>華軍實力堅强</p>
<p>南通·如臯·崇明·啟東·海門·等五縣之游繫隊、自經第二戰區第二十四集團軍積極改編訓練以來、已蔚成勁旅、約計總額在七萬至九萬人之間、分佈在各該縣之沿港口及內地各重要據點、其沿港之部隊、最為精銳、在每一團中備有野砲及小鋼砲數尊、實力至為堅强、總指揮官李明揚、會於上星期親赴×地召集各該縣將領、指示今後方針、所有前各縣訓練之壯丁、均紛紛入伍、調往××地、再施於學術方面之各項訓練、担仔後備隊、</p>
<p>日方增兵佈防</p>
<p>據咋晚由通州來人語現代社記者云、自華軍調集各縣沿港後、原駐防在通州天生港·大生港•海門靑龍港、等處之日軍，大起恐慌、運日由上海方面開往之海軍陸戰隊人數約六百餘名至各港口佈防、計天生港口外停日艦兩艘、汽艇四五十艘、靑龍港停小型砲艦一艘、觀察該批增防之日軍、精神萎靡不振、精壯者甚少、彷彿從前方新近調回留養、日方水陸兩用式飛機、每日三五結隊翱翔沿港天空、從事偵察、</p>
<p>各淺港已封鎖</p>
<p>蘇北方面港口，自每門起至如皋止、計有宋季港·牛洪港·堅積港·和通港·靑龍港　新港·靈甸港·三和港·東一號至第三號港、再向南　則為南通之大生港·天生港·新港·及崇明島各港口、其中宋季港·新港·兩處岸灘、離航行海道較近、日軍汽艇、易於登岸、且己往日軍屢次登陸、必假　該兩處港口而來、故華軍恐日　方再循舊路登陸、特於日前將各該　港實施封鎖、以杜塞來路、日來各沿港情勢、異富緊張、風聲鶴唳、戰事有即將爆發之勢、居民遷避紛紛、行駛北沙綫之外輸、因此貨運清淡、故减少班數、以靜觀局勢之發展、</p>
<h3>日方暴力下　天津現狀</h3>
<p>據甫於昨日由天津來滬之客商談、自七七蘆溝橋事變後、日方在華北一帶、橫行無忌、不僅任意壓迫華人、且對各國僑居平津之外人亦異常仇視、尤其對英法僑民、亦壓迫甚厲、凡各國商輪進出口、必須先靠停日租界碼頭、施以各種檢查後、方得再駛入各該國之租界碼頭、起卸貨客、天津各國租界與華界交通繁盛區域、會建有國際大鐵橋一座、以資溝通往來、詎日方竟攫取外人權益、、無形封鎖華租界交通計、特於去年秋間在中原公司後面、亦建造鐵橋一座、將於下月中可落成、將來該橋完成後、則各國在天津之租界等於死地、又據該客談、華北方面民眾雖處在日人淫威之下、直如奴隸、惟對國家觀念甚深、愛國情緒、非常激昂、所惜者北方人民階級制度、仍沿習未除、但靑年學生工人、背家離鄉或拋妻別子、紛紛南下、參加抗戰工作、殊形踴躍、</p>

<h3>德籍猶太人　來滬將受限制　非華方簽准護照　即不准啓程來滬</h3>

<p>華方簽准　之護照、然後證明其來滬乃準就業、或在滬有親友照料、始准放行、聞德國今不再准許依賴公眾給養之難民由德來滬、但對近巳定就艙位者約三千人左右、將准若輩啟程、目前上海之難民局勢、尚不致引起焦慮、蓋供給移民之住所與基金、均見寬裕、但苟非續得款項、則此種局勢、於一月內仍將轉趨惡劣、今移民除居於</p>
<p>私人寓所　或友人處者外、均棲身華德路之單身男子寓所、與滙山路之眷屬寓所、及河濱大廈、亦有少數居華盛路新房屋中、該所房屋、擬改建醫院、由難民中之醫生與看謢經營之、苟該醫院照現定計劃成立、則除醫洽猶太移民之外、大致將兼為外界服務、</p>

<p>嚴重風波　蓋自偽「維新政府」妒忌偽「市府」每月龐大之「雜稅」收入、以「上峯」資格、迫令傳筱庵、自二月份起、取消三十八種偽「消費稅」後、偽「府」每月所蒙受之直接损失、達五十萬金以上、此項偽「府」所視為經濟來源之大動脈、</p>
<p>一旦斷裂　本可置偽「府」於死命、緣捨此三十八種「消費稅一之外、僅有限於浦東沿浦一角之偽房捐、及南市浦東滬西之偽「車捐、曁浦江中之僞「船捐」等三種、前一項為「季捐」性質、後二項為「年捐」性質、所得極微、惟僞維新政府</p>
<p>曾允每月　津貼四十萬元、以外不足之數、偽「市府」又擬開征偽「地稅」及偽「營業稅一爾種、以資彌補、現二月份即將告終、偽「維新」之四十萬元津貼費、證實係屬一種口頭敷衍、已無希望、新偽「稅」雨種、因籌備不及、亦難征收、故偽「府」命運</p>

<h3>日方貶抑法幣價値　華北僞鈔遍地　法幣價値雖被抑低　但事實上反有加水　華北銀行派員來滬報吿</h3>
<p>新聲社云、我國法幣政策實行以來、因準備充足、深得中外人士信仰、日偽以「聯鈔」套取外匯失敗後、强迫貶抑法幣價值、中外銀行、均受壓迫、華北銀行界、特派員抵滬報吿一切、詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>僞鈔遍地　自平津淪陷後、北平僞組織設「中國合準備銀行」、發行毫無擔保之鈔券、强使市面流通、至今年一月十日止、其流通數額、約一萬八千五百萬元之鉅、此外更有「滿洲中央銀行」「冀東銀行」之無　保發行鈔券、在平津兩市流通者、約一千六百萬元、又河北省銀行更膨脹發行、至五千八百萬元、最近「聯合準備銀行」叉發行五分一分半分三種小額不兌換紙幣、流通範圍、旣極廣關、發行數量、更漫無限制、</p>
<p>强制貶抑　偽「聯合準備銀行」發行鈔券、旨在謀吸收我法幣、套取外滙、旋因我國政府統制外匯、人民信仰法幣益堅、對於偽鈔、則隨收隨付、於是偽組織之套取外滙計劃失敗、偽鈔流通、大受影響、乃下命令、初强令我法幣在平津及其他淪陷市區內、停止流通、繼又限令我法幣中之中交兩銀行天津地名鈔票九　折行使、今年二月二十日起、改為六折行使、三月十日起、停止法幣流通市面、</p>

<p>幣價實况　事實上、華北各游擊區內、及天津租界區北平使館區、法幣有加水、約百分之二、且從未聞有人以我法幣、為九折或六折之行使、可知我法幣價格、穩定如故、信用益堅、反是、「偽鈔」額然在平津兩市、十足通用、而實際上價格、校法幣為低、</p>

<h3>廿七年中國銀行業的動態</h3>
<p>— 楊政</p>
<p>銀行業是金融機構的中心，所以，其業務的消長和社會經濟的榮枯，是有密切的關係；尤其是在戰時，如民國二十七年份的銀行業務，跟抗戰而有着更赤著的變化。並因戰區的擴大，由沿海江流域伸展入西南各省去了。這一番變動，是值得加以深切的注意，足備將來的研究，可是材料的搜集，却是不易，筆者就各種報章及刊物所載銀行業方面情形，加以有條理的編制，以見一年來銀行業的動態，可是關於見聞，遺誤之處，在所難免；且報章所記，往往有未成事實，即已宣傳，此中如有錯誤，還希原諒。</p>
<p>一，銀行的設立</p>
<p>在民國二十七年這一年中，因戰時的影響，新設的銀行衹有重慶的和成銀行及重慶市民銀行兩家，前者資本六十萬元，係由和成錢莊擴充而成，一月開幕，後者開幕於七月一日，停業銀行亦衹兩家，就是嘉定的嘉定銀行和上海的通和銀行。前者創於民十一年二月，資本十萬元，民十三年，增資十萬元，連前共爲二十萬元。民二十年六月十三日，呈准財政部註冊，於本年十月十一日，以週轉不靈，宣告停業，經市商會試行和解，於十一月二十六日開會得債權人同意，定期復業。後者創於民十四年五月二十五日，資本五十萬元，民二十七年十月廿一日停業，依破產法聲請上海市商會辧理和解，其儲蓄部份，於本年十二月十三日，已簽訂正式和解，商業部份，尚待解決。</p>
<p>在此一年中合併銀行，有廣州絲業銀行和廣東實業銀行合併於廣東省銀行，前者創於民十九年三月十八日，資本五十萬元，於本年一月間併歸廣東省銀行。後者創於二十五年一月一日，係廣東省政府所辧，資本額定毫洋五百萬元，實收衹毫洋一百萬元，於二月二十一日歸併於廣東省銀行。查廣東省銀行資本額原爲一千五百萬元，經絲業及廣東實業兩銀行合併後，資本仍爲一千五百萬元。復業的銀行，衹上海恒利銀行一家，查該行於二十六年八月九日停業，經申請市商會和解，始於本年十月四日復業，資本仍爲七十五萬元，除儲蓄部停辧外，其餘商業往來，信託，保管等各項業務，仍繼續營業。</p>
<p>二，分支行的裁併和添設</p>
<p>銀行裁撤分支行，完全是基於業務上的變動，一年來計爲十一家，內辧事處五家，支行三家，分行二家，滙兌處一家，再就地域來說，江蘇五家，福建二家，江西·四川·河北·廣東·均各一家。茲列表如下：</p>
<p>行名　地址　性質　月日　備註</p>
<p>四明銀行上海西門　支行　一月一日　由霞飛路支行辧理</p>
<p>仝上上海城區　辧事處　仝　上由南市支行續辧</p>

<p>交通銀行　上海界路　分行　仝上　由南京路支行續辧</p>
<p>仝上　上海提籃橋　仝上　仝上</p>
<p>自戰事西稱，中國金融業的重心，也亦步亦趨，移轉到西南各省，尤其是重慶，已代昔日的上海地位了。中國爲求長期抗戰，得最後勝利，銀行資金必須向內地移動，這樣，方能建設戰時工商業基礎，並以發展內地的農村，故在這一年中在內地添設許多分支行，便是顯明的表出。共計有九十家之多，辧事處四十二，分會一家·以銀行類別來說，省市立的計三十九家，商營的計二十六家，政府及特許的計二十四家，華僑經營的一家。就中省市立銀行添設爲最多，計川省二十四家，湘省十三家，粵省六家，鄂省三家，江蘇，陝西，西康，貴州均各二家，甘省一家，茲列表如下。</p>

<p>三　戰區銀行的善後</p>

<h3>金融　物稀爲貴　金價連漲六天　共計八十五元之鉅　飾金高掛二一七元</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗市因逢星期例假、到塲聚集者寥落無幾、惟本市殷富收購、藏儲心思仍切、又委託某錢兌業代爲搜購、奈售者均以物少爲貴、供意頗淡、市面續向此次漲風中之新高峯挺進不已、實因籌碼枯竭、及各幫需求殷繁所致、十時三刻、某錢兌業進銀樓幫三十兩、二千二百四十一元爲午收價、較上日又漲六元、（已連漲六天、共計八十五元、）又聞某錢兌業門市十時後、售予本地幫五十兩、價二千一百四十元、因之銀樓首飾金每兩兌出在正午時、亦掛大一元、大同行老慶雲等改懸二百十七元、新同行爲二百十五元、收進二百零九元、又二十五日倫敦電、英純金因英鎊繼續高昂、故每盎斯續降一辦士、計達七鎊八先令二辦士半、</p>

<h3>證券　一週間　中西股票市况</h3>
<p>上週眾業公所外股交易、雖僅二日有半、而活潑情形頗足稱述、有若干種股票、價格且已造成八一三以來之新紀錄、如自來火·電車·不記名股、公和祥、及瑞镕普通股皆是、</p>
<p>國際信託股、頗引起操業者之注意、成交特多、全週成交達五萬股以上、價盤旋於三·三五元至三·五〇元之間、週末以三·四五元收盤、</p>
<p>墾植在上週成交總數亦近三萬股、價由八·五〇元至八·九〇元、而以八·八五元收盤、</p>
<p>瑞镕普通股、成交約一萬二千股以上、價由初開之六·三〇元、而達六·四〇元、週末成交二筆、共八百股、價更升至六·六〇元、</p>
<p>業廣前週亦因承江灣跑馬塲爲日人購去之間接影響、一般人頗信百老滙大廈、或亦有售脫之可能、因之市價由八·九〇元、一躍而爲九·五〇元、至上週以此說無從證實、市價稍軟、盤旋於九·一〇元至九·三五元之間、成交亦近一萬股左右、</p>
<p>自來火自董事會議決擬發去年度股息六厘後、價遽上騰、由八·一〇元之老價、步漲至九·五〇元、而一〇·二〇元、成交約一千股、</p>
<p>公共汽車、問訊者頗不乏人、約有五千股成交、價爲二三·二五元、會德豐步趨堅俏、週末價超出三五元、</p>
<p>各種公司債券、上週成交極暢、所有中國營業公司八厘債券三萬六千兩、價爲五七兩至五八·二五兩、電力公司五厘債券四萬二千一百兩、價爲八七·五〇元至八八·五〇元、國際信託六厘債券成交二萬兩、價爲六二·五〇兩、工部局五厘債券二萬元價八五元、中央地產公司五厘半債券一五〇〇〇元、價八九元、眾廣公司六厘債券八千五百兩、價九三兩、跑馬總會六厘債券八、〇〇〇元、價八八元、</p>
<p>公和祥碼頭股票上週成交六六一股、價已升至一九四元至一九五元、</p>
<p>上週生橡皮價格、倫敦漲起一八七五、紐約漲起三七磅音、本市對於橡皮股票之感想、漸趨良好、成交雖未大旺、而各種股價價格、無一不漲、計敲老佛價由初開一·二二元至一·三〇元、橡皮信託由三·五五元至三·九〇元、英楂華由一五元至一五·五〇元、楂華由二·二〇元步趨至二·六〇元、尤爲堅俏、筆打晏拿由一·一〇元至一·一八元、伯丁由一·一六至一·二一元、客倫登由·四〇元至·四二元、太拿馬拉週末以二元價格成交六千股、猶未饜需求者之望、要之上週末各種橡皮股票、均以最高價收盤、</p>
<p>上週五厘美金公債、亦成千五百五十元、價爲美金六二元、較廉於倫敦行市、（倫敦市價爲六七）然此等貨物、可遇而不可求也、</p>

<h3>藥材　草蔻仁來源已斷</h3>
<p>草蔻仁產於瓊崖、近以該區被佔、來源遂絕、雖號貨存積充實、然人心一致向昂、如紅盤售開、每擔爲十八元、查前市衹售十三元半、刻市已漲起四元、惟現在銷路僅屬零星、設一且開展、尚須續升、</p>
<h3>南北貨　高生晒肉漲元許</h3>
<p>石碼生晒圓肉、大結束前曾有運到十餘件、昨已見樣、色澤片張及身份均佳、當即開出、比前漲起一元六角、郵包口耳、昨某號開出一百數十包、價爲二百十元、市象有暫定之勢、行盤無上落、槐米貨底甚缺、來源且乏、僅有零星開出、價爲二十元、</p>
<h3>五金　本釘漲價後　實銷有限</h3>
<p>本廠元釘、因原料短缺、？（盤元及元絲）所以廠方扳價居奇、行情每桶提加至十七元（倍司）後、在農暦歲尾、囤戶及客幫等爭相收辦、故交易尚稱熱鬧、惟最近廠方覩紅盤後、實銷方面無新發展、心思轉軟、昨衹二三百桶成交、價仍在十七元、聞大批交易、行情方面尚可商量、至小花色分釘、其交易尚頗可觀、昨本街及客幫開出共達五六十桶、行情四分每桶售三十六元、五分三十一元、六分二十六元、倘欲出口、則關稅方面、尚需客家自理云、</p>
<h3>美白鐵實銷尚暢</h3>
<p>美白鐵因品質優良、光彩奪目、故在市上銷塲、不受日貨排擠、開價仍挺勃不屈、前昨以來、因實銷暢達、如福建·溫州·寗波·天津諸幫均有採辦、開出達二三百紥之多、其價四十八張薄貨每張售三元七角八分、厚貨如二十八號每担售三十四元五角、二十六號每担售三十三元七角五分、二十四號每担售三十一元七角半、十八號至二十二號每擔售三十二元半、查本街交易、近亦可觀、但外匯趨緊、來源短少、執貨同業、心思十分高硬、對於來市開價、一時不肯放鬆也、</p>
<h3>糧食　白粳喊高</h3>
<p>昨日國米來源、河下未到、車運來包子有三四千包、市面自前午轉緊後、昨早開手、形勢卽見上風、蓋因囤戶納意頗濃、引起本街活絡、同時售方喊場旣高、兼復扳守、是以結果若厚粳行情、除高料者以價貴略提一角外、其中段貨悉升二三角、薄稻特貨情形相仿、中關亦較堅硬、挺秀角外至二角、杜洋尖埠尖高定次秀、獨變元紅盤一　之後、卽見鍛羽、僅平定而已、</p>
<h3>煤炭　煤球廠盤堅挺</h3>
<p>煤球經春節數天停工、不能出貨、致本市門莊空虛異常、待貨孔亟、日昨各廠開工、銷路踴躍、約有一千餘噸之多、售盤堅挺、計開義泰興煤球每噸三十三元、南洋雙龍老牌三十二元、副牌二十九元五角、小廠貨便宜五六角不等、同行自車、送到另加行槓、聞義泰興新廠亦已正式成立、加入出貨云、</p>
<h3>紗花業的悲慘面　苦哉斯時！</h3>
<p>讀本報源君所作、「紗花業破天荒之盈餘」一文、的確讚在外人腋下、倖運稱千載一時的發橫財機會　（？）可是源君但知其一、未知其二、只知其歡樂面、未知其悲慘面、同屬租界特區之滬東區域、戰前可謂集華高紗廠之大成、沒有一家、不獲鉅利的、自從被困於硝烟彈雨裏、在這淪陷區裏的紗花業悲慘面、眞是不堪回首話當年、</p>
<p>（甲）淪陷區裏的紗廠、機器、貨物、有的被掠一空、有的經砲火摧殘、七零八落、有的强行合作（？）（完全是强佔去的）有氣節而不願合作的眼看着機器的銹壞、眼看着滬西紗廠獲利的盈千累萬、回顧自己的生產工具、在暴力刦持之下、動彈不得、這是何等悲慘的局面、</p>
<p>（乙）被陷於戰區的紗廠、能生產的工具、旣無法轉動、而戰前的「未付賬款」如五金、物料、燃料、蒲包、繩索、竹爿等金額、大至數千、小至數十的債權人、一到年關、却紛紛追逼、催索、有的洋行家、甚至不顧與廠方交往十·廿年的歷史與情感、居然請了律師、大發其哀的美敦書、實行法律起訴、原是難怪、不過這是人力所不可抗的鉅災、眞所謂「吃死人不吐骨頭」的了、廠方那有錢來應付呢、只得低聲下氣的敷衍週旋了、</p>
<p>（丙）被解散的成羣失業者、飄泊無依、即有照戰前薪額津貼四五成的少數留守職工、抗戰近兩年來的生活拮据、物價飛漲、已感東挪西移、挖肉補瘡之苦、一到年關、眼瞧得人家荷袋裏塞飽、而自己却「畢的生司」囊空如洗、典質過關（年關）的、恐大有人在、</p>
<p>（丁）不幸在戰區做花號的朋友、生財房屋、棉花等一槪付之浩刦、流亡孤島只落得兩手空空、有的甚至戰前是花號的堂堂老闆、而戰後要在孤島上謀一月入十餘金的位置、竟不可得、這是筆者親耳所聽到的、</p>
<p>「獨樂樂、不若與眾樂樂、孰樂」我想、破天荒盈餘的廠家、倒也值得兼顧一番、（龍駒生）</p>
<h3>春風滿面之呢絨業</h3>
<p>二十七呢絨貨價、始終高漲、客幫生意雖突减、然本街交易走銷、較之舊昔爲盛、同業大小店號賺錢甚豐、其營做淸水門莊舖子、卜利尤厚、有老存貨及春夏所進大批存貨者、盈餘特眾、因之呢絨大小同業、莫不大有盈餘、開派花紅、勞資雙方喜形於色、滿面春風者大有人在、今將同業中凈盈餘者調查刊左、未賺滿五千元者不列入之、</p>

<p>我國中學師資之現狀、旣然如此、其補救的辦法、當然要從事進修、但在過去、全國師范大學衹有一所、教師雖要進修、亦苦不得其所、因爲過去國內沒有機會、所以很多到國外去進修的、但是出國進修、離鄉旣遠、所費又大、且所學又不合國情、加以進修空氣、向甚冷淡、教師資格、本不注重、因此大多數教師旣不覺得必須進修之刺激、於是遂順着惰性、因循敷衍、以至於今、現在對於師資訓練的主張、旣經與前逈乎不同、則教師對於進修的觀念、亦應急速改變過來、在歐美各國、對於教師的進修、是非常重視的、無論教育行政當局、學校當局、以及教師自身、對於有效的進修辦法、都是努力推行的、我國師范學院設立以後、一方面固要養成未來健全的師資、但另一方面、對於在職師資之進修亦應給以適當之機會、不然、將來師范學院的畢業生一班一班的出來、此輩落伍的在職教師一批一批的被淘汰、將來結果、不是演出大量不合格教師失業的悲劇、就要閙出新舊教師互爭飯碗的風潮、教部有見及此、所以在師范學院規程第五條規定「師范學院應與所劃區內教育行政機關、通盤考查該區內中等教育師資之需要、爲有計劃之招生、」同時、在第十二、十三、十四諸條中規定師范學院得附設師范研究所、高級中學教員分別程度、招收各級在職中學以教員進修證明書、作爲教員檢定合格之文憑、前者所以績密招收新生、後者所以顧念在職教師、當此戰事破壞之後、無論國家個人、經濟必感困難、中等學校未必能以添設、中學師資、因以易於過剩、師范學院與其多招新生、還是多開進修班使已有經騐之教師、得增加其專業訓練之機會、如此辦法、收效旣可迅速、所費又較減省、而已進修之師資、又得了地位上之保障、不致有被淘汰之危險、</p>

<h3>向校長先生建議</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>教育界節約救難運動，自從發起以來，聽說已經有了相當的成績，眞呌人快慰之至！各校進行的方法，究竟是怎樣的，我不能一槪知道，現在我有一些意見，想向各位校長先生一談，事關公益，想也是各位所許的吧。</p>
<p>孤島的兒童和靑年，在這樣的時世，還能够安心求學，不能說不是他們的幸運。但是我相信，在他們裏面，正有許多學生的家長，和難民相彷彿，同受着戰事的影響、而在經濟上有處處捉襟露肘的恐慌。現在要他們的子女節約救難，他們旣稍勝於以民，當然義不容辭，然而我們主持這運動的各界領袖，尤其各位校長先生，却不能不顧慮到這一層，而予以體恤，使他們同樣能盡這義務，而又不致多增額外的支出，得以兩全其美。</p>
<p>我以爲旣名節約救難，就當從「節約」二字着眼。除了學生家庭和學生本身的節約以外，就學校而言，浪費的固然要節約，非必要的，或者有較廉的肛用品的，也應該節約。據我所知，各級學校裏，就有許多可以節約或設法代用的東西。例如小學校裏的蠟筆，或顏色，每盒就需費六七角，這些東西在這時代，照我看來，根本就是奢侈品。其他圖畫紙和各種簿子，可省則省之，不可省也儘有廢物利用的方法，更不必要求其整齊劃一。至於中學校和大學校，消費更大，那末可以省去或肛用的東西就更多了。假使各位校長先生，肯注意於此，而實行節約，我想，除了救難捐不生問題，可以達到預定額數以外，還正有其他的好處，接踵而來：第一，一般的節省物力，使較少的物力，能得到較大的效用；第二，爲了教育用品大都是舶來品，就此可以減少資金的外流。</p>
<p>再說到學生的家長，看見學校裏爲他的子女節約，我想就是最淸貧的，也都肯樂於輸捐了，因爲在他們繳付預定的學雜各費以外，並不多需支出，他們當然不會有所非難。也許最好的辦法，除了隨緣樂助以外，各位校長先生就直捷指定節省某種用品，將該項已繳之費，移作難民捐，這樣，事情就格外容易辦了。</p>
<p>以上是我的「管見」，不知賢明的校長先生們，以爲何如？</p>
<h3>出發</h3>
<p>— 龔樹揆</p>
<p>校長先生是一柄掃帚，在操塲上劃來劃去；許多學生是落葉，跟着那柄掃帚，滾來滾去。</p>
<p>校長先生吊着眼皮，側了頭，又掃到校門口，說：「大家左轉灣，面孔向我！」</p>
<p>落葉在掃帚的命運下，一順兒的向左滾了。</p>
<p>「來！」眼皮吊高了：「女生組靠最左！」</p>
<p>一堆顏色鮮艷些的葉子，吹到貼着荷槍的×軍，撫摸支那小孩頭髪的「和氣靉叆之東亞」。</p>
<p>「大家把身上弄弄乾凈！」校長先生皺了一皺眉。望着後面高級的學生，正在用力的拍刷衣袖，弄得烟塵迷目，就用手向上一揮：</p>
<p>「今天要特別整齊，男生戴學生帽的走出來，排一隊，穿藍布長衫的也排一隊。女生穿短裙的排一隊，旗袍的排一隊，絨綫大衣的排一隊。大家都不要分年級，快排起來。」</p>
<p>葉子們像在旋風里舞蹈，混亂地飛動。</p>
<p>「　！」一個女學生哭了，因爲她頭上的木梳，給別一個女學生的絨綫大衣糾牢了，她的頭髮扯得很痛。</p>
<p>女王先生急忙去拆散了木梳和絨綫。</p>
<p>「隊排好了，再有幾句重要的話，大家聽好！」校長先生的眼皮，這會只吊了右面的一隻，左面的像在微微的脥着。「現在出去是迎接英勇仁義的×軍，他們剛下鄉去剿了土匪回來。你們看見英勇仁義的×軍，都要脫帽鞠躬。聽見嗎？聽見的舉手！」</p>
<p>五年級的王華，摸着臉上打用腫的黑紫色還沒有褪淡的創痕，突然像電光　一亮，憶起了幾天前的情景。</p>
<p>但葉子們都伸起了手。那些低年級同學的手，斜斜地，正像穉枝的縱橫。</p>
<p>「看見英勇仁義的×軍，面上都要露出笑容，表示親善，聽見嗎？」</p>
<p>葉子們的穉枝，又歪斜地縱橫。</p>
<p>王華咬着嘴唇，憤怒的翅翼，在他的胸膛里，撲撲地震動。</p>
<p>「看見先生拍手，你們也要拍手。聽見嗎？」</p>
<p>大家又都舉手，但這會似乎有個同學，聽見了拍手兩字，當作要實行，眞的拍了一記手。</p>
<p>王揑緊了拳頭，像二個鼓鎚。</p>
<p>「不要動！」校長先生嚴肅地，回頭把脥着的左眼，向旁邊一瞟：「張先生，把旗子拿出來！」</p>
<p>張先生和其他的不是張先生，都捧出一捆一捆的旗子，向學生的行列里分發。</p>
<p>幼稚生覺得花花綠綠的旗很有趣，起勁的甩着。三年級李大生，指旗上「×支親善」的「善」字，問矮脚虎顧榮。矮脚虎拍拍大頭說：「善，和傳染病的染一樣聲音。」</p>
<p>高級里的女生，却在弄平皺捲的旗角。</p>
<p>校長先生的眼睛依舊在一脥一脥，這會又提高了嗓子：「旗不要甩！」</p>
<p>旗，靜靜地立在小學生的手里。</p>
<p>「我不要！」突然，王華的旗，「嚓嚓嚓」的飛沫以空中，又疲倦地安息在校長的黑皮鞋旁邊。</p>
<p>「怎麼？」出乎校長先生意料之外的挑　落開了嘴巴。</p>
<p>「我不要，我不去！我的爸爸給他們槍斃，我的姊姊給他們拖去，我臉上的傷痛還沒有好，我不忘記赤老！」是一串連珠砲的爆裂。</p>
<p>「哦，你瘋了嗎？」校長先生尷尬了，只得又厲聲說「張先生，拖他出去！」</p>
<p>張先生和不是張先生，執行了命令。</p>
<p>紫色的腫臉，在幾條胳膊里，像沸水燙着一樣的轉了幾轉，倔强的站在校門外一棵靑松下面了。</p>
<p>葉子們墨黑的瞳子，都像鐵，給靑松下的磁石吸信。</p>
<p>「大家不要理他，」校長先生說，又用力喊着口令：「向前……看齊！立……正！開步……走！」額角上的靑筋，像蚯蚓般爬着。</p>
<p>一串葉子，在掃帚下掃出去了。</p>
<p>「唱『東亞同盟歌』！」</p>
<p>葉子的行列，浸在天眞的歌聲里。</p>
<p>這時，王華彈着噴火的眼球，舉着鐵鎚的拳頭，衝入了隊伍中，喊着說：「你們不要去！」</p>
<p>大家都呆了下來。</p>
<h3>霧</h3>
<p>— 高孝冲</p>
<p>霧，白茫茫，糊糊塗塗的瀰漫着，像厚厚的水蒸汽似的。（無數細微的水珠是遮遍了大地。）古廟只支出了他的棱角，禿樹只伸出了他的枝尖，遠遠的寶塔也只透出了頂端。霧，白茫茫，糊糊塗塗的瀰漫着。</p>
<p>一雙脚，穩了，又來了一雙。一雙，一雙，急急的行伍，山脚下只顯出了幾塊尖石。前面是白茫茫，後面是白茫茫，四邊都是白茫茫，快步的行進。望望山腰看見了一片白色，糊塗。抄路，轉灣，望着足尖走路。「不要響，留心，彎腰。」一聲暗號，傳了全隊。不聲不響的，數十個彪形大漢，頓時各自變了八十歲的老頭兒。</p>
<p>「槍向前，俯進。」眼睛望着前面進行，有時也向左右望兩眼。大石，細沙，枯草，樹根，崎嶇的路，留在脚後。「散開！」交頭接耳的說了幾句。包抄！一個抱，一個殺，結果了敵人的哨兵·半圈紅色露出在高處，望着他前進。</p>
<p>靜靜的，悄悄的，大家都已到了。躲在大樹下，伏在大石旁，還有默默的伏着地上前進。轟！轟轟轟！蓬蓬轟轟轟……！一個手國彈呌起了幾十個。興奮，痛恨，現出在每個漢子的臉上。殺聲槍聲手溜彈聲，交織着。敵人，倉惶，驚嚇，狼狽的想逃。那裏可以，四面是子彈，槍刺，溜彈。逃，爬，哭，呌，一個個吃了子彈，槍刺，溜彈，血交叉的橫流。剩了幾個，跪，叩頭，舉起手。每個都綑了手，俘虜。</p>
<p>凱旋，挺起了胸，硬起了頸，背着槍，走，大步的走。大聲的唱：「霧！今天是霧，明天是霧，後天也是霧！我們希望每天都是霧。殺殺殺！好讓我們把他們殺得半個不留……。」</p>
<h3>人與英雄</h3>
<p>— 楊彥歧</p>
<p>英雄是人？是的。可是人並不個個是英雄。就爲了人不個個是英雄，所以英雄有崇拜價值。</p>
<p>不過，今日的英雄被埋沒得太多了。雖然「名」並不是英雄的目標，但是「名」之外，還有史實上的地位，足以使空白的歷史上，劃上金色的條綫，閃出萬丈光芒，永垂千古。垂了千古，不是英雄本身的風頭，而是後輩的偶像。基督教徒崇拜基督思想和耶穌爲人，不都是由於一本聖經嗎？所以，文學是英雄的石碑，爲了英雄而樹立在宇宙間的石碑。</p>
<p>因此，文學工作者似乎不能忘了替英雄立碑的使命。立碑並不就是寫墓誌銘，而是寫隨便什麼形式的文章。文學作品裏有了英雄，便會有生氣，有血，有肉。不然，便是沒有生命的死藝術。</p>
<p>今日崇拜英雄的心理幾乎要低於崇拜美人了。爲的是英雄不够有味，怕，不敢崇拜。而美人呢，旣容易寫上紙，又容易引人入迷，反正沒有人會一本正經；於是盛哉美人崇拜狂！</p>
<p>也許有一個原因吧，人人不敢抬頭望英雄，只肯低頭撫摩着美人　手。所以，閉起眼來，使自己先看不淸現實，然後再替自己造一個穀，把自己包在裏面，鎭天做夢，希望在夢境中能昇天享福。其實人在地面上，不死是不會昇天，何況死後是否昇天也還是問題。旣活在地上，就得活在地上，要脫離地面現實是不可能的；旣活在現在，就得活在現在，要脫離這大時代也是不可能的。不可能，不可能，一千個不可能！</p>
<p>所以，文學的石碑又有第二個用途了，是和鏡子一樣，要有反照的功能。要映出這個地面上的現實，要映出這大時代的顏色。不然，不是死人的爛骨頭，便是空夢一塲。爛骨頭不久會更爛，爛得無形無蹤；空夢一到醒來，也便飄然而止，不知何往；像一陣烟，比烟還輕，像一片雲，比雲還薄；一切都不是石碑，都是五光十色的肥皂水泡，好看，美，是的：就欠一點壽命。</p>
<p>恩斯特托勒說：「藝術並不在挑動聽眾感情之後就消滅她的效力。」她要永遠在天地間留下痕迹，因爲文學根本就是痕迹；藝術是美的，美却一定要有生命的美。木乃伊的面孔一輩子不會微笑，還說什麼別的呢？</p>
<p>藝術要表現英雄，是的；人不個個是英雄，但願藝術不要浪費。浪費了作者精力不要緊，浪費了讀者時間才眞不大值得。人，英雄，至少要稍稍的分個明白。</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>這話使大家稍稍有些掃興，但這都以爲是葉團長故意危詞聳聽，也就不以爲意。葉團長見大家漠然無動，不禁暗暗搖頭，喝了一口酒，又道：</p>
<p>『我倒不怕敵人來進攻，一二千人我還抵擋得住，所怕的是爲虎作倀的漢奸。老實說，中國要是沒有漢奸，我們消滅敵人一定還要快些。』</p>
<p>於是便又談到漢奸，鄔雅淸說他一路上看見過水少冒牌的什麼隊，不但不能保護民眾，抗拒敵人，反而和敵人暗通聲氣，到處騷擾民眾。他很感槪的說：『一個好名詞，到了中國，常常要被用壞，現在連强盜土匪，都可以用冠冕常皇的名詞來掩飾他們的的暴行了。』</p>
<p>『就是這批人最難對付！』葉團長長歎了一聲說：『要不把他們勦辦罷，縱容他們擾害閭閻，良心上實在說不過去。而要勦辦他們罷，在目前這時候，中國人打中國人，又實在痛心得很。並且把他們逼得急了，難保他們不明目張膽的去投降敵人，爲虎作倀，這禍患就更大了。』</p>
<p>大家也都歎息無語，不過畢竟事不干己，談過就算，也不放在心上。酒闌席散，彼此興辭出來，市梢頭的慶祝元旦軍民聯歡大會正開得熱鬧，街頭劇「放下你的鞭子」已演到了尾聲，臺上和臺下的吶喊融成了一片。葉團長點點頭說：</p>
<p>『這里的民氣倒很可用，可惜還欠深入一些。』</p>
<p>梁團附彷彿有所顧慮似的，對葉團長說：</p>
<p>『這樣的天氣，敵機未必會來，就使來了，疏散還來得及。大家平時也都勞苦得够了，一年一度難得的元旦，我們不要去掃他們的興吧。』</p>
<p>梁團附不再說什麼，和其他幾位大隊長，就跟着葉團長一同回到團本部去。（二一）</p>

<h3>救濟學徒</h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>中國商店和工廠的學徒，好像是個小僕役。我們走進小商店或小工廠裹，常會看見十二三歲的小僕役，穿着破舊的衣服，做打雜的事情，那便是學徒。</p>
<p>學徒的生活，每天早晨五點鐘必須起身，一直到晚上十點鐘才得睡覺。沒有休息時間，也沒有例假。如果事情忙了，還要做夜工。事務做錯了，還要受罰；如罰站，罰跪，打耳光，打手心，打屁股。這樣的生活，要經過三年或五年，才算滿期。滿期後，才可稱為「夥計」或「司務」；才可支用薪金。學徙時期，是沒有薪金的。</p>
<p>我們知道，現在的學徒，就是將來商店工廠的經理和職員。現在的商店工廠經理和職員，就是從前的學徒。我國工商業不發達，大都由於工商業經理和職員，缺乏經濟常職與工商道德。因為他們在學徒時期，所學得的太淺薄了。我們要救濟工商業，一定要從救濟學徒入手，才能收效。茲擬辦法數則，以供關心工商業的同胞，研究和參考。</p>
<p>一·我國政府，亟應釐訂「學徒法規」，最低限度，要限制學徒工作時間，每天以八小時為準，至多不得過十小進。</p>
<p>二·學徒的年齡，最小要在十五歲以上。</p>
<p>三·學徒的工作，要在學習範團以內，如燒飯，洗衣服，抱小孩，胰夜壺等雜事，不得呼喚學徒操作。</p>
<p>四·學徒的期限，至多不得過三年。</p>
<p>五·僱主除供給學徒食宿外，應酌給生活費用，每月至少三元。</p>
<p>六·每天晨晚，僱主應給予學徒進修的機會，如進夜學校或補習學校。一切學費，應由僱主負擔。</p>

<h3>陰陽怪氣的年頭</h3>
<p>— 胡塗</p>
<p>陽暦年剛剛過去不久，陰曆年又臨着了人間，前後時閒不滿二月，竟要過兩個年頭，弄得人們糊裏糊塗，真有些陰陽怪氣。</p>
<p>有人挽陽曆年是外國年，陰暦年是中國年，愛學洋氣的，自然喜歡過陽暦年，而種莊田人家，便喜歡陰暦年，因為牠節氣分明，有春分，有榖雨，陽暦比陰歷節氣更要分明，年月計算得也更準確，記憶也更方便，政府早巳明令全國一律改用陽曆，而一般人仍舊陽奉陰違。弄得不管陽曆年也好，陰膊年也好，一古腦兒都過了算數，結果陰陽不卜，年月差遲，豈有不陰陽怪氣之理？</p>
<p>其實陽曆年非常方便又容易記，又容易算，决不是陰曆年，月大月小，捉摸不定，間月前後，分不清楚，茲將陽曆節氣作歌如下，以便參考：</p>
<p>實用陽曆真方便，</p>
<p>廿四節氣都好算；</p>
<p>每月兩節有定期，</p>
<p>最多相差一二天；</p>
<p>上半年來六，廿一，</p>
<p>下半年來八，廿三；</p>
<p>諸君熟讀這幾句，</p>
<p>以後曆書不用翻；</p>
<p>一月小寒接大寒，</p>
<p>若種早稻須耕田；</p>
<p>二月立春和雨水，</p>
<p>小麥田裹草除完。</p>
<p>三月驚蟄又春分，</p>
<p>稻田再耕八寸深；</p>
<p>清明榖雨四月過，</p>
<p>油菜花開麥也青；</p>
<p>五月立夏望小滿，</p>
<p>割麥鋤草不要晚；</p>
<p>芒種夏至六月到，</p>
<p>黄梅雨中難睜眼；</p>
<p>七月小暑接大暑，</p>
<p>天氣雖熱草須鋤；</p>
<p>立秋處暑在八月，</p>
<p>早稻田裏穗已熟；</p>
<p>九月白露又秋分，</p>
<p>稻米收後田再耕；</p>
<p>十月寒露霜降來，</p>
<p>地裏只留落花生；</p>
<p>冬月立冬見小雪，</p>
<p>稻麥變錢喜又欣；</p>
<p>只等大雪冬至到，</p>
<p>把酒圍爐又一春。</p>
<p>這首歌，的是好歌，只要記得熟了，便不必再要賣「老法新曆本」了。但是這首歌中意義，我們還得說明一下。</p>
<p>我們的地球，是繞着太陽打圈子，轉到了三百六十五天，再加上五點四十八分五十七秒三十九厘的時間，就是繞了太陽一大轉，呌做一年。所謂春夏秋冬，便是一年的四個氣節，這氣節也是依照地球繞太陽轉動而定的，比如地球是一個扁形的面孔，太陽居鼻子與兩眼的中間，地球從嘴巴上轉起，起轉之點算作「冬至」。向左上方慢慢轉動，到了左耳上便是「春分」·走這一節路子的工夫，約有九十天，遇到閏年，加上一天，再慢慢的向h轉動，到了頭頂，便是「夏至」。走了這一節路子的工夫，約有九十二天，再向下轉動，到了右耳上，使是「秋分」。走了這一節路子的工夫，約有九十三天，再向下轉動，到了嘴巴上，便又是「冬至」·走這一節路子的工夫，約有九十天，總合起來，便是三百六十五天五時四十八分五十七秒三十九厘，若問為什麼每一節路程，日子有多有少，各自不同？這個答案，大概的說：就是因為這面孔是扁的，「冬至」到「春分」經過離太陽最近，所以日期最少；「夏至」到「秋分」經過離太陽最遠，所以日期最多。</p>
<p>我們為方便起見，把三百六十五天，當作一年，零數四年凑起來成一天，加到二月的最後。打圈子的法子，旣是如此，而打圈子的路子中，地球各部分天氣冷熱或天時長短，都有不同，這便是地球轉動，各部份受太陽尤直射斜射的關係形成的，我們中國在地球上是處於北半坡中間，「冬至」時期正是太陽光直射地球南半坡中間的一條錢上（呌南回歸綫）我們這里因為地球中間的腰帶（即赤帶）高出兩坡中問很多，這坡的人看那坡的光，自然有些擋眼，所以見面的時間短，天時自然短，陽尤也是一樣，被擋着射過來的很少，所以天氣也就冷了，日脚也晝短夜長了。但地球不住的轉動，太陽光慢慢又直射到中間來，陽光也慢慢一天比一天的多，所以天時也慢慢的長，氣候也慢慢的熱。等到太陽光直射到地球中間的那條帶上（赤道）射來的光不多不少，寒暖正是適宜。這時便是「春分」的時期，天氣溫和晝夜一樣長。但當地球轉動太陽光慢慢又射到北半坡來，我們這裏天氣便更暖，天時也便更長，等到太陽射到我們頭頂上，光芒最烈，這時便是「夏至」。天氣熱日長夜短，太陽光這時已被一條大繩子（北回歸綫）攔住，不能再向北移，地球轉動太陽尤便慢慢又離遠我們，所以天氣轉凉時間縮短，這時便是「秋分」。天氣與天時同「春分」時一樣，後來叉因為地球向南半坡轉動，我們這裏的天氣便感到更凉，時間也更短，等牠直射綫被南邊的那條繩子攔住，不再走時，而直射在那條繩子上，即便是「冬至」。天氣最凉最短。因此地球轉動不息而形成了春，夏，秋，冬，的一年四季。</p>
<p>以上這些道理，可惜沒有用圖來表示，但讀者若細心研究，便知道陽暦的確是準確。方便，比較陰曆那樣照月亮來計算來得合理了。因為陽曆1年，三百六十五天與地球繞太陽的一周的數目，相差不到六點鐘，四年才差一天，陰曆月亮圓過十二回，裏面有五六個小月，這麼算起來，一年三百五十五或六日與陽曆比較相差約有十日之多。諸君試想想農人的高利貸，公務員的薪俸。三房客的房租，是多麼不方便呀。</p>
<p>大家懂了陽曆的好處。便奉行陽曆規律。那麼久而久之，便不用老法新曆本。不過陰曆年了。這自然不會陰陽怪氣，年月差遲，弄得人們糊裏糊塗了。</p>
<h3>一難婦</h3>
<p>— 菲菲</p>
<p>途遇一難婦，向我哀哀乞：變目淚交流，兩手且顫慄。衣破不蔽體，四肢支離骨；欲行又不前，步履盛無力。呶呶為我言，身世原不薄；奴僕任使喚，標高可百尺，只為「八一三」，戰事起條忽；烽火遍地來，膽破心騖駭·故鄉難安居，老家變空屋，扶老和携幼，但想逃命活。輾轉走他鄉，資金都用缺；兒死沙塲上，夫斃道路側·一女被據去，至今音信沒；重新返家園，房屋成瓦礫。饑寒相熬煎，貧病迭交迫；日無一餐飽，晚依　下宿，茫茫何處去，哀哀向誰泣•，從此飄泊身，淪為流離骨。吁嗟噓—聽罷訴說淚如麻，心頭怒濤無復加，叫萬萬同胞齊統一，保國保民方保家，同胞其速醒，莫為旁人作牛馬！</p>

<h3>愛的敎育（九）</h3>
<p>— 亞米契斯著　雲舫繪</p>
<p>（上）忽有一個婦人，從人堆里掙扎進來，這就是洛佩梯的母親，她大聲的哭道「洛佩梯呀，我的孩子呀！」這時又有一婦人在洛佩梯母親後面流淚，這就是被救的孩子的母親。</p>
<p>（下）立刻有一輛馬車停在門口，校長抱了洛佩梯，洛佩梯把頭埋在校長懷裏臉色蒼白眼睛閉着。校長把傷給大家看，「同學們，洛佩梯是勇敢的孩子呀！」這時同學都很敬佩，靠近的學生都去吻他的手。</p>

<h3>過年</h3>
<p>— 王小二</p>
<p>鑼鼓敲來十八番，</p>
<p>臘月又到廿二三；</p>
<p>別人過年我小二不知道，</p>
<p>小二過年正可與君談。</p>
<p>自從寒冬臘月到，</p>
<p>家家戶戶忙過年；</p>
<p>有的雞魚齋祖上，</p>
<p>有的圍爐吃年飯；</p>
<p>有的燒香敬菩薩，</p>
<p>有的送禮挑禮擔；</p>
<p>正是二十三叫日，</p>
<p>張羅送灶不怠慢；</p>
<p>備了橋馬不算數，</p>
<p>還要買糖把供獻；</p>
<p>只因灶君到上界，</p>
<p>善惡要與上帝言；</p>
<p>不如買糖粘住灶君口，</p>
<p>常言「吃人東西嘴要軟」。</p>
<p>但願上天言好事，</p>
<p>且求下界保平安；</p>
<p>這自然習慣遺傳到現在，</p>
<p>但也是必須如此才過年。</p>
<p>王小二全然不信道一套，</p>
<p>因此上什麼儀式不舉辨。</p>
<p>（白）各位明公送灶送禮，自也是人情之常，每年舊例，但如今災鴻遍野，民不聊生，何忍圍爐小酌，何必送往迎來，更何必齋神敬鬼·孔干曰「未能事人，焉能事鬼」諸君若有閑錢，去救濟難民，或貢獻國家乃為必要，一定要買糖送灶神，善惡求其口惠，這叉何必？老實說現在的灶神，若果有靈，他看你「庖有肥肉，野有餓殍」，見人餓死而不救，他一定在玉皇大帝面前奏你一本說你不仁不義率獸食人，絕不會因為你一塊糖便緘口不言的，所以我說凡事求心之所安而已，豈真有神鬼麼？諸君若再三思，便知我言不錯。</p>
<p>新年點綴真新妍，</p>
<p>大街之上多商店；</p>
<p>這邊擺着新年畫，</p>
<p>那邊又在寫春聯；</p>
<p>年蓋也有白蛇傳，</p>
<p>也有唐僧到西天；</p>
<p>也有羣仙封神榜，</p>
<p>也有呂布戲貂蟬；</p>
<p>這些小二都不愛，</p>
<p>單買臥薪　膽越勾踐；</p>
<p>荊柯刺秦真忠勇，</p>
<p>投軍別窰薛平貴；</p>
<p>這都是愛國男兒漢，</p>
<p>到如今留得美名傳；</p>
<p>年劃買罷心歡喜，</p>
<p>再到那邊選春聯；</p>
<p>有道是「發揚新氣象」，</p>
<p>聯的是「恢復舊山川」。</p>
<p>再有是「國權自主」，</p>
<p>對上個「民國萬年」。</p>
<p>廚房內寫「火燭衛生要緊」，</p>
<p>牆壁上貼「留心節省水電」；</p>
<p>所有這皆是警句，</p>
<p>全不過當作格言。</p>
<p>（白）春聯年畫，意義必須警惕，發人深思，可惜外面賣的蠢俗不堪，不是神仙眷屬大團圓，便是聚寳發財一團和氣，使人看了，毫無實用，我小二雖是粗人，但也並不喜歡牠，我的意思，只求實際為上，若帶些敎育性質尤佳！除夕這天事更繁，</p>
<p>且將收拾過新年；</p>
<p>逢關結賬分紅利，</p>
<p>敬鬼敬神把禮參；</p>
<p>送舊迎新忙守歲，</p>
<p>鑼鼓聲喧喜笑歡；</p>
<p>堂前擺下香花供，</p>
<p>財神畫像掛中圓；</p>
<p>一變紅燭分左右，</p>
<p>也有碗來也有盤；</p>
<p>紙課爐中漸焚化，</p>
<p>香烟繚繞在神前；</p>
<p>磕頭幾個並禱禱告，</p>
<p>「財神菩薩行方便」；</p>
<p>滿口元寳吉利利利話，</p>
<p>余銀財寗用不完；</p>
<p>拜賀年歲皆富貴，</p>
<p>兒女爭添壓歲錢；</p>
<p>爆竹聲聲聯遠近，</p>
<p>時斷時續如炸彈；</p>
<p>連大烽火人靜寂，</p>
<p>正似當年「八一三」。</p>
<p>小二不見此情猶自可，</p>
<p>見了之後正心酸；</p>
<p>我中華國難歐頭遭刦運，</p>
<p>多虧領袖解倒懸；</p>
<p>凡是中華好兒女，</p>
<p>豈肯袖手作旁觀；</p>
<p>忍辱偷生固非是，</p>
<p>况且快樂過新年；</p>
<p>這年頭多少人有家歸不得，</p>
<p>多少的夫妻不團圓；</p>
<p>多少人一天不足三餐飯，</p>
<p>多少的烟囱不出烟；</p>
<p>多少人空有血汗無處賣，</p>
<p>多少人流了血汗沒米鹽；</p>
<p>多少人餓死路旁無力葬，</p>
<p>多少人露宿街頭耐飢寒；</p>
<p>滿目流離隨處是，</p>
<p>你想悽慘不悽慘？</p>
<p>我今快樂把年過，</p>
<p>全然半點不周全；</p>
<p>這正是苦樂不勻分貧富，</p>
<p>眞所謂「一無團結散沙盤」；</p>
<p>我小二心中越想越難過，</p>
<p>唉！難堪之中更難堪。</p>
<p>（白）話說新年委是熱鬧非凡，萬家歡樂，歌舞昇平，遊戲塲不消說是人山人海，馬路上也只見衣帽全新，這繁華，端的了得。只可恨許多因戰事逃亡失散的人，如喪家之犬，不能一樣快樂，引為憾事。故所以小二今年悶不樂，既不敬神，又不禮拜，也無錢去周濟旁人，實無心去找尋快樂，我只是悶坐擱樓，敎小兄識字而已，不過時而聽到爆竹之聲，一時神經過敏，有些觸目驚心，不知何故。</p>
<p>馬路之上甚非凡，</p>
<p>也有女來也有男；</p>
<p>男的新裝如「阿福」，</p>
<p>女的粉作泥菩薩；</p>
<p>這些事情且不表，</p>
<p>單講一件懷習慣；</p>
<p>牌九骰子家家有，</p>
<p>也有麻雀抄幾圈；</p>
<p>不分白天與黑夜，</p>
<p>不分早來不分晚；</p>
<p>為了金錢賭勝負，</p>
<p>真是埋頭又苦幹；</p>
<p>耗費精神真無趣，</p>
<p>頭昏腦悶腰又酸；</p>
<p>一年辛苦不容易，</p>
<p>三天兩夜愉個乾；</p>
<p>越輸越是不放手，</p>
<p>欠下賭債怎樣還；</p>
<p>也有好朋好友翻了臉，</p>
<p>也有好兄好弟打桌翻；</p>
<p>也有輸急去尋死，</p>
<p>也有上吊吞雅片；</p>
<p>大人賭錢孩子看，</p>
<p>家庭敎育算那端？</p>
<p>從小學成壞習慣，</p>
<p>長大要改難上難，</p>
<p>衆位明公聽我說，</p>
<p>從此不要再賭錢；</p>
<p>小二心中多感慨，</p>
<p>可奈無才說不完；</p>
<p>暫且寫下這一段，</p>
<p>且將投上「大衆周刊」。</p>
<p>延平路自給所　賣花生米的難民</p>
<h3>發財</h3>
<p>— 難記者</p>
<p>新春見面，大家拱拱手，鞠個躬，說聲：「恭喜發財」！</p>
<p>每個人都歡喜聚財，積財；但無論是人家祝頌，是自己希望，却不說：：「恭喜聚財」，也不說：「恭喜積財」，偏偏說：「恭喜發財」。</p>
<p>「發」分發也；散發也；發放也。可見一個人要「發財」，須先「發」財；肯「發財」，才能「發財」。</p>
<p>說句俗話，呌做「明　中去，暗中來」；掉句文言，呌做「小往而大來」；現在，救濟難民，正是「發一財機會，也是「發財」途徑，希望每個上海人，勿交臂失之！</p>

<h3>學徒的生活</h3>
<p>— 陳君生</p>
<p>「喔唷姆媽呀！」</p>
<p>這低而微沉痛的呻吟，是我進店未滿二個月，每犬晚上，睡在被內必經過的呼聲，續而想起了，被砲火洗禮下的故鄉，還有慈母的面孔，他頭上的髮，我出來時候，已經花白了，現在想起一定更是龍鍾了，我是去年四月由鄉來滬學藝的，經親友介紹在一片天津館子內學業，店內除師父師母二人外，還有一個小師弟，今年才得四歲，和二個老師父一個我，一共是六僩人，起身是上午四點多鐘，掮牌門板·掃地·生爐子等，一切雜事，暇時領領小師弟兜兜圈子，到是還好，沒有半個月，飾父就呌我拿了饅四，到附近地方呌賣，「要否，然個饅首！」像茶坊酒店·浴室·舊貨攤·小菜塲等，風雨無阻，假使少賣幾個，就要挨師父的責罵，師娘的毒打，師娘的脾氣又小氣，又兇狠，他高與時，少賣了饅頭，對你使幾個白眼，不高興時，（或又麻雀輸了錢），啊呀，那可不得了，就要嘗到他老娘手中的武器，打我的唯一武器，是一根爐子的鐵扦，那鐵扦，又粗叉硬，打在身上，立刻一塊青傷，非三天五天不肯好，故我每晚撫摸我身上的傷痕，甚至痛哭我命運的墮落，阿生，你在做什麼？小鬼，又耍作死啦！這句話差不多，是我每天的家常便飯，啊，我的生活有誰來憐惜呢，的確除了我的母親，又有誰呢？但我决不如此懦弱，頹喪，必須在困苦的環境中，掙扎出我光明和自由的道路才是。</p>
<h3>一週戰事</h3>
<p>廣州瓊島</p>
<p>廣九，粵漢，廣三，各路，木週內皆無多大變化，惟東莞，太平之日軍前以步砲聯合兵向華軍賢安陣地進犯另一部更由南頭登陸與東莞太平之日軍相呼應，華守軍雖勇猛抵樂，但因衆寡懸殊陣地略有移動，後由華軍大軍趕到，乃將寳安克復日電退據虎門一帶，海南島方面海口瓊山，澄邁之日軍經華方聯合大舉反攻、增加日軍困鄭不少，日軍因，受損失，在當地大肆燒殺，現正竭力進攻但為欲達其快效起見，又有日軍在島南三亞灣登陸，進犯榆林，以圖牽制，而華方已有戒備趕築工事，從事固守。（按日軍忽然犯海南島是日軍欲强化華南戰事，堵塞國際軍火來源加緊窺佔粵桂行動但其另一意義即為威脅英法，因為日如佔取瓊島，香港安南終有寢蓆不安之勢，故目前英法皆欲一致對日，但迄朱有何具體行動）。</p>
<p>山西方面</p>
<p>晋南華軍自前次將中條山以南日軍挫折後，故近來山北解縣安邑聞喜绦縣各處，均有激戰，日前解縣西北已為華軍進據而安邑聞喜方面各據點也為華軍克復，日軍心有不甘大放其催淚瓦斯冀得一逞，現仍在對峙巾，晋東方面華軍正圍攻和順。</p>
<p>湘鄂方面</p>
<p>鄂北鄂中前綫平靜惟鄂南金牛鎮之日軍日前經華軍大舉進攻，因華方砲火之猛烈日軍似有損失，後日軍因欲解圍乃大放其毒瓦斯頑抗。豈知風向忽然倒變，日軍反自蒙不利因此華軍見有勢可乘，奮勇前進故能克復金牛。又武昌西南一帶金口，黄陵磯雨要地亦相繼克復，開是役，華軍游擊隊能控制交通加以突擊。頗奏奇功</p>
<p>其他方面</p>
<p>皖南繁昌日軍，興華軍激戰，聞共長澤部隊長亦受重創，此外徐州偽軍周選臣部三千，綏北偽軍劉虎慎部二干餘，于志謙部三千均皆反正來歸，又連日華空軍亦頗活躍在蘭州一地即擊落九架之多云。</p>
<h3>新年生活之一</h3>

<p>春秋</p>
<h3>生產敎育販賣團</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>男女團員共五十人　成立一載成續斐然</p>
<p>最近為了上海的十寓難民，救濟問題日覺困難，一般負責的人員，發覺到與其使難民長期坐食，待人救濟，不若使他們受到生產敎育，能够自力生存為佳，所以提倡難民生產敎育的口號，正高唱入雲。而同時，使我想到八仙橋青年會所辦的生產敎育販賣團，已有十足一年的歷史，成績很好，可使關心難民生產敎育問題者借鏡的。</p>
<p>戰事離開上海之後，青年會就舉辦一個生產敎育販賣團，目的是救濟在戰事中失去了職業，不能生活的青年男女，招收團員五十人，一面使他們受到敎育，一面使他們生產，能够自食其力。消息傳出之後，報名的人很多，不久就足額，裹面更有一部分是女性。經過了相當時期的訓練之後，男女團員，就開始販賣工作。</p>
<p>團員所販賣的商品，全是國貨工廠的出品，事前由青年會接洽就緒，帶有代賣的性質，就是等商品售去之後，再歸還貨價，而由販賣的團員，取得一些佣金。五十個男女團員，每天拿了重笨的皮篋，籐包，滿備商品，向四處奔走，為生命而掙扎，夏天在烈日下晒得滿頭大汗，冬天在朔風中吹得涕泗直流，一種耐勞耐苦的精神，是使人目覩了會同情的</p>
<p>他們或她們，所走的全是住宅區域，上得人家的門口，看見了人便會含笑的懇你買他們的東西。態度的謙遜，禮貌的周到，會使人敬佩。商品翻了開來，你不買他們，也沒有一句怨言，並更進一步向你解釋，他們所帶的商品，全是第一流國貨工廠的出品，售價完全和外面的商店一樣·你買了他們的東西，不但可省軍錢，省時間，免得再到外面去，而且又可救濟他們，帮助他們，等於做件善事，不是一舉兩得嗎？這樣一來，被他們說得不買也要買了。</p>
<p>不拘是男女，服裝是穿得非常樸素。無論一天耍走多少路，總是步行，不坐車子。所販的商品，以日常家用的東西居多，而女團員所帶的更以化裝品，婦女用品為多。奔走了一天，弄得好也可做十元左右的生意，作它抽得什一的佣錢，也可有一元左右的收入，所以一個月也可有十多元至二十元的進益。至於生活方而，他們每是幾個人合租一間屋子，飯食有的自己煮，有的買來吃，是十足的平民化，所以用勞力換得的，也勉强可度過各人的苦生活了。</p>
<p>這個生產敎育販賣團，已有一年的歷史了。在過去1年之中，五十個失業的男女，得以有業，得以自力圖存，當然要歸功於青年會的舉辦者。這樣的救濟難民，當然比祇是向各界募捐，使難民坐食無事好得多。祇是青年會辦的生產敎育販賣團，團員僅限五十人，未免太少，不能使多數的失業難民都有商品販賣，得以自力生存，而繼青年會之後，又沒有別個機關，辦同樣的販賣團，是會使我們感到不足的。</p>
<h3>我若為王</h3>
<p>— 燕華</p>
<p>“If　Were　Kina”</p>
<p>派拉蒙出品　大光明戲字映</p>
<p>我沒有讀過佛蘭珂斯章奧的歷史，不知道十五世紀這位流傳於法國的大詩人真實的史蹟是怎樣，但是，我們感覺這影片通過了現代的思維與批判，他，已經成為一個領導民衆保衛祖國，最堅强的現代鬥士了。</p>
<p>最少，這樣歷史古裝片，才是有着它準確明顯地啟示的，那就是說，不耍太看輕民衆的力量，他們是國家最忠勇的戰士，無論在那一秤政體裏面，民衆的武力，是不能輕視的，一個專橫暴戾的政府，結果必定會潰崩的，而一個深得民衆擁數的政府，他必定是人民大衆的政府；過去歷史上是如此，而現在，當然也是如此。當現在法西斯蒂的國家們，正威迫民衆侵略作戰的時候，我們可以斷然地預料，這些侵略集團的國家，總有一天會傾覆的，而使他們政府傾覆主要的動力是什麼？不用說，還是民衆！</p>
<p>「我若為王」難然一樣充滿了英雄美人與羅曼的克的氣息，但是它却給我們一個很大的敎訓。全片故事大約是說十五世紀法國巴黎，被勃根第人所包圍，當時法王路易十一世手下將士都不肯作戰，而一個生長在巴黎貧民窟的法國大詩人韋奧，他却領導了全城的民衆和勃根第人作戰，總致把勃根第人打敗退了，但當時朝庭將士因妬忌他，這位功成而退的詩人終於悄悄地離開巴黎。</p>
<p>在整個故事裏，它值得我們學習的地方很多：　法王路易十一，他果然驚奇章奧能利用民衆，比如路易目己審判民衆，常常把他們吊死，而章奧不但不吊死他們，反而給他們金幣還不得不使路易驚奇讀嘆了；　韋奧打敗勃根第人以後，法王路易並不重用他，反而對他說：「你快走吧，你在這裏一天，我一天沒有安寗」！根據道個地方可以看出路易十一世對於民衆武力依然不重視；　因為歷代法王路易之昏庸，牠很自然造成一個歷史小可違反的後果，那就是後來歷史上著名的法國大革命，這種大革命主要的動力，正和前面所說一樣，還是民衆！</p>
<p>至於演出部份，在大導演佛蘭克勞埃雄偉魄力之下，他對於全劇塲面表現了三種特點：　人物的漫書化：在這裏，他把全劇幾個主耍人物都使他們詼諧化，比如章奧的輕飄，敏捷，他的逃避及戲弄御林軍的方法，使觀衆對於章奧發生一種瀟洒，機警的好感；其次，是法王路易十一世那樣人物，他一洗一般帝王沉重嚴正的感覺，而在各種姿態上，如笑聲的尖銳，嘴角的牽動，走路姿勢的顫慄，處處都把法王路易寫成一個相當滑稽的怪人；　是情感氣氛之濃馥：如章奧正在貧民窟和羣衆狂飲歡呼的時候，突然御林軍跟蹤而來，致挑起一塲鬥爭時之刺激與緊張；與勃根第人作戰時，貧民窟裏的女郎胡潔受傷而死，在一種悲凉悽其的氣氛中，韋奧把她抱到敎堂裏去，當他吻着她顫動嘴唇的時候，她死去了；　是羣衆塲面抓取的强固：韋奧把法王庫中糧食全部散給民衆時之歡躍；韋奧領導民衆攻打勃根第人時戰爭塲面之活潑，激盪；這些，都可以說是全片最精彩的特色。</p>
<p>所以，我認為，「我若為王在春節獻映的外片中，還是較有力的佳構。</p>
<p>演員中，飾法國大詩人章奧的考爾門，他的瀟洒，機警，聽忽的地方，表現得很够味，但在一種英俊，勇武的地方，考爾門因為體質的關係，還不够英武有力；飾法王路易十一世的貝斯勒斯朋，一向飾演硬派的角色，在道裏，他的整調，走路姿勢完全都改變了，看慣他戲的人，（「鐵血主義」「羅賓漢」等他都担任很重要的角色）對終他現在所飾的角色，一定會感覺興趣的；法蘭西絲第飾凱塞琳公主，戲雖不多，但很溫馨柔和，她是一個能演戲的女角</p>
<h3>拼死吃河豚</h3>
<p>— 墨典</p>
<p>我們有句俗語，呌做「拼死吃河豚」；然而吃河豚魚中毒的新聞還是時常看到。據說河豚味厚美鮮，不過烹　小慎，是會中毒的。上海曾有一家茶室，以「特聘專門　　，煮製河豚」作為特色食品之一，但是倒底吃的人不多；而現在這家茶室也已改為戲院了。</p>
<p>昨天的晚報上，又發現了一條食河豚魚，全家中毒的新聞，這些人難道真是以生命和口腹作賭博嗎？那是决不會這樣傻的，而食河豚中毒的新聞所以迭見的緣故，是在r貪」。他們明明知道吃河豚是有生命危險的，但是美味當前，不覺食指大動，在舉起筷來狼吞虎嚥的時候，生命早巳置諸度外了。如幸而不死，則撓起大拇指來，表示自己有「拼死吃河豚」的勇氣，否則，在臨終的時候，也自己解嘲這樣不致死了做「餓鬼」。</p>
<p>現在我們的「友邦」，也在做着吃河豚的「英雄」，起初果然覺得津津有味，撓起大拇指來自嗚得意，但是在肚裏的河豚終究作起怪來了，等到一作怪，即使有高明的醫師，也不過灌灌肥皂水，聊盡人事，其命運祇在指顧之問耳</p>
<h3>一號汽車照會和一號司機</h3>
<p>— 萬爾倍</p>
<p>在上海馬路上行駛的汽車必須有一張「照會」，這是誰都知道的。到最近領出來的汽車「照會」，號碼一定超出一萬號以上，也就可知道，上海至少有一萬輛汽車，其中包括自備汽車和出租客車，以及自備運輸車和出租運輸車；自備汽車和出租客車的分別在「照會」上可以看出來的，前者是黑底白字，後者是白底黑字，至於運輸汽車的分別是自備者也係黑底白字，而出租者則為黄底白字。</p>
<p>我們每天在馬路上所見到的汽車的號碼，有十，百，千，萬，以外或以內的，但是掛一號「照會」的汽車，我們就從來沒有看見過，那末一號照會有沒有呢？有的！據說一號照會的主人姓周，這一張　一號照會的頒發遠在民國初年，可知這家姓周的以前就很富有，當然這一張最早的一號照會祇有一張，决不會有第二張出來，所以它很可貴，它的主人也把它視同奇實，以為很有面子。可是掛這張一號照會的汽車已經是一部「老爺汽車」了，所以現在一直放在汽車間里不出來，這「老爺汽車」的主人翁為了要保有一號照會的綠故，月季捐從來沒有間斷過，否則，這張一號照會會被車務處吊銷的。</p>
<p>汽車不是隨便什麼人可以駕駛的，開汽車的都有一張司機執照，這種司機執照必須經過二度嚴格的考試及格後，方能領出。現在司機執照已發到二萬多號，據說考得第一號司機執照的綽號呌小梅郎，姓名則無從探悉。小梅郎早已去世了，他生前曾在猶太富翁哈同氏家里開汽車；其時，還有一段和一號汽車照會的故事。</p>
<p>哈同因為僅有一號司機而無一號汽車，所以曾託人向周家說項，願出重資購買他家的一號汽車照會，姓周的很幽默的回答說：「哈同要一號汽車照會，因為他有一號車夫，預備有兩個一號；而我們有一號汽車照會，哈同那里旣然有一號車夫，那末我們情願出特別的工錢要一個一號司機！……」結果當然使哈同氏遺恨地下在上海　，在汽車照會上打主意的，也是一般的現象了，如同樣字位，或聯號，這大槪是所謂「裝飾美」吧？而同時，也確有一部份人以坐汽車作為「裝飾美」的，實際却是個「空心大佬官」。</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第四回　溯往事樂天傳妙語　締新交勝地作淸游</p>
<p>朱愛人道：『遠嗎？那不要緊，我自己有車子在這裹。回頭我再送你到學校裏，你總司以放心的了。你且說出到那裏去？」吳君素道：這幾天聽說到石湖去游玩的人很多，你也去過沒有？』朱愛人縐着眉道：『阿呀！我的吳小姐！吳敎授！我這醫院裹的事也忙不開，那裏還有功夫去游石湖呢？一天到晚，所見的是病人的臉，所聽得的是病人的聲。今天因為來迎接兩位姊姊，吿了個假，正是「偷得浮生半日閒。」請你引導我們去游玩一下，石湖就是石湖好了。只是那裏可有吃飯的地方嗎？』吳君素道：『怎麼沒有？現在那邊什麼都有呢。』她們四個人出了火車站，朱愛人便到停車處，找到了汽車，便向石湖進行。這其間，朱愛人開汽車是個老手了，因為她是個醫師，時常出去診病的，有時遇到急診，就非開快車不可。何家兩位小姐，雖然也會開車，但不十分熱練。因為她們家裏是用慣汽車夫的，向由汽車夫開車。惟有吳君素，却絕對不會開汽車。她說得好，她說：『現在我還沒有汽車，等到我有了汽車，再學開也不遲。』吳君素還有一件欠缺之處，却是近視眼。近視眼雖然戴了眼鏡，也是一樣，但多少總有些吃虧。近視眼有兩種，一是先天的，一是後天的。先天的是遺傳性，像吳君素的近視眼，便是先天的，因為她的父親，也是近視眼呢。後天的是他的父母並非近視眼，子女忽然近視眼，這或者是有別的原因。近來因為江南之人多近視眼，這個問題，也惹起醫學界的討論，很想有個矯正之法咧。且說吳君素雖沒有汽車，但是也並不感到不便利。因為凡是都市之區，到處都有公共汽車。就是要特雇的汽車，汽車行也非常之多，價錢也很為便宜。平均在二十分鍾內，不過半塊錢罷了，又沒有小賬，比了戰前要便宜的多。不用說上海那種人口繁密之地了，便是在蘇州，各種公共汽車，長途汽車，小型汽車，都也似穿梭一般的往來。就是從火車站到有湖，也是有公共汽車的，不過公共汽車到每一站都要停頓，比較的慢了。（四七）</p>

<h3>舊劇前途的展望（一）</h3>
<p>— 迂堂</p>
<p>迂堂先生爲評劇名家，近為本刊特撰此文，對改良舊劇，盡量發揮，立論高超，為不可多得之名著，全文約四千言，分期發表，以嚮讀者。（編者）</p>
<p>近來頗聽得有人要改良舊劇，更有人尊某坤伶為前進女伶。要在幾年前的話，不佞倒很願從旁凑個趣兒，現在却不敢隨　附和了，原因是我對舊劇今後的地位有了一個新的認識。</p>
<p>聊公在本刊上主張把平劇和崑劇正各為國劇。不佞在六七年前，也會以同樣意見草為文章，大聲疾呼過；當時曾從舊劇本身，分析出它所具有的數種不朽性，再拿話劇電影以及其他新的地方劇一一和它比較，判定了舊劇的偉大，和預言了它的不朽。為了希圖增高舊劇的地位，也曾集合幾個熱心研究舊劇的同志，商議着如何把日就式微的舊劇加以改良：從演員的體魄，學識，人格，服飾的檢定，劇本的意識，修詞，以至樂器的改善，燈光的配置，舞台的建篆等，都作為研究的對象，自鳴得意的幹了一陣子，終究因為缺少毅力經濟，以至一無成就。近幾年來，也不知是為了對於舊劇的豁然貫通呢，還是思想落後，忽然對於一向認為光明燦爛的舊劇前途，大大的懷疑起來，頗以為從前的努力太不澈底。在數度苦思之後，得到了一個新的理論，替舊劇算定了它未來的命運；這並非說舊劇將從此消滅，而是說舊劇在今後，終將因抵不住時代激流的冲擊，以至無力掙扎而失去已往的光榮。</p>
<p>舊劇本身是一種劃時代的藝術，這是誰也不能否認的；可是任何藝術，必與現實的人生發生密切的聯繫，而後始有廣大的欣賞羣。有了廣大的欣賞羣，始能發揚光大永存不朽。反過來說，一種藝術，與人生失却了聯繫，便失却了欣賞羣；旣沒有了欣賞羣，就不能免去沒落的運命。說得好聽些，就是關進象牙之塔去的東西，終非在十字街頭的人們所能接受。譬如說，寫字所以傳達思想，原和人生有極大聯繫；後來有人寫得一手好字而被稱為書家，他擁有着欣賞眾。現在有人以善書甲骨石鼓名於時，欣賞者自然很少，原因是不和現實的人生聯繫。舊劇是時代的產物，它的意識和技術，適應於舊中國的封建社會，月經過多種地方性的洗鍊，刪蕪存菁，造成了特殊的光榮的地位。可是現在時代不同了，人民的思想形態已起了極大的變化，電影和話劇的勃輿，很快的攫取了它一大部的觀衆，要不是平劇仗着它本身的通俗，還能投合一般的人，早會隨着崑劇銷聲匿跡了。</p>
<h3>卓別麟的開口問題</h3>
<p>— 呆子</p>
<p>好萊塢妄加揣測傳說紛紜</p>
<p>不久之前，好來塢傳出消息，說是笑匠卓別麟為報復德國的禁映他的幽默作品，預備要開拍一部「獨裁者」。卓別麟是反對聲片的，自聲片盛行，代替默片以來，已有十年的歷史，但在這十年之中，卓別麟在銀幕h還是沒有開過一次口，甚至沒有導演過一部聲片。然而他的新片「獨裁者」却是一部聲片，而且他還要在銀慕上開口，於是卓別麟在銀慕上將怎樣開口，便成了問題，為好萊塢這所影城中談話的大好資料了。</p>
<p>現在卓別麟在傳音器中的聲音是怎樣？這問題是解决了，為的他曾在電台上播過幾次音。所以成為啞謎的便是他在銀慕h面將怎樣開口？假如卓別麟改變了過去在銀幕上維持緘默的成見，而他未來的一部新片是聲片，那他將採取某一種方式的對白，又成了問題·而他在處女作的聲片之中，又是否將會現出過往的笑容？是別一個問題。</p>
<p>據接近卓別麟的亞爾利夫</p>
<p>斯所說：「今後的卓別麟，至少將拍攝三部聲片，不過這都出於偶然，計劃確定之後，更或許會放棄的。卓別麟最初在銀慕上開口時，所說的話，都是一音節。」亞爾利夫斯是卓別麟的業務經理，關於卓別麟的種種，當然比人們知道得底細些。過往好萊塢也曾幾度傳出卓別麟將計劃拍攝聲片的消息，但利夫斯每次表示不確的，事後人們果然知道卓別麟並沒有道種計劃。</p>
<p>過往卓別麟也時常和他的朋友討論聲片問題，朋友之中，有的相信卓別麟將永久維持他是一個不開口的啞劇明星，但有的却相信他為了事業關係，會慢慢的走進聲片的領城。不過任何猜測，都是空中樓閣，非要等到最後一分鐘，卓別麟的聲片着手開拍乃至正式公映才能確定。因此現在卓別麟拍攝「獨裁者」的消息，雖由影城中傳了出來，是否聲片，卓別麟本人是否開口，一切要待公映時才能證實。</p>
<p>卓別麟在好來塢祇有一個攝影塲，在那邊，畫家和木匠都在忙着工作·每一部影片進行拍攝時，這攝影塲中每是聲息全無，非常的靜默，不像別個攝影塲在拍攝聲片時，是不斷的有聲音傳出來。就是卓別麟本人，他規劃或導演每一個鏡頭的戲，非常忙碌，如果他自已也要拍入鏡頭時，就由他的助理卡德黑文担任導演工作。一慕戲拍好了，卓別麟獨個子坐在一張帆布椅裏，兩隻手反把在頭骨上，沒有一個人去和他談話，連得新聞記者也不敢去近他？因為這就是他在思慮的時候，仟何人不能去打斷他的思潮。每一個鏡頭中間的休息，都是如此，攝影塲上始終是靜默着。但如果他真的要拍聲片，那這種沉靜的空氣，或許是要改變了。</p>
<h3>蕭伯訥之幽默</h3>
<p>—認獎章為侮辱</p>
<p>（美聯社倫敦二十四日電）今日蕭伯納以向來之語調宜稱：「好萊塢推彼之Pygmalion為去年中最佳之劇本，並予彼以獎章一事，實為對渠莫大之侮辱•」蕭氏謂：「彼等予我以獎章，實為對我莫大之侮辱，彼等何不亦予喬治六世一獎章，蓋以喬治為目下英國唯一之帝皇」云•（按Pyg日Pyamalion為Cyprus之王。鍾情於一石雕之神像。）</p>

<h3>Hainan Island Military and Civilians Cooperate in Resistance, Continuously Inflicting Significant Damage on the Japanese</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Still Attempting Inland Invasion Despite Strength of Less Than Two Divisions</p>
<p>Coastal Counties Continuously Subjected to Bombing by Japanese Aircraft</p>
<p>Guangzhou Suburban Guerrilla Forces Active Again Recently</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Japanese troops occupying Hainan Island, currently fewer than two divisions, are still advancing inland. Japanese aircraft are constantly flying low and bombing various parts of the island daily, seemingly focusing on attacking guerrilla forces in the coastal counties of China, attempting to quickly establish a puppet regime and build air and naval bases there. The Chinese side, with the cooperation of military and civilians, is continuing to inflict significant damage on the Japanese. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan On the morning of the 24th, over a hundred Japanese infantrymen, accompanied by two cannons, searched for grain and women in Taipingchang, Huangniguo, Yinxi Cave, Shiqian City, and other places. They were attacked along the way by Chinese guerrilla forces, suffering numerous casualties, and then retreated in defeat towards Taipingchang. (26th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to foreign sources in Guangzhou, Chinese guerrilla forces in the suburbs of Guangzhou have become active again recently. Gunfire can be heard clearly at night in Guangzhou city these days. Xicun, in the west-northwest suburbs of Guangzhou, was once invaded by Chinese guerrilla forces on the night of the 23rd.

<h3>Overall War Situation Remains Unchanged</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The overall war situation remained unchanged as of the evening of the 25th. Japanese troops are being transferred busily in various locations. Chinese troops in Jinxi are besieging Xia County, achieving considerable gains. Japanese troops in Yuncheng are attempting to invade westward, but Chinese troops have taken strict precautions. Over five hundred Japanese troops in Lixian captured Songgang on the 24th and are currently engaged in fierce fighting. Japanese troops have intentions to invade Suning again. Chinese and Japanese troops in Hubei are facing each other near Tianmen and Jingshan, with local battles remaining intense. Japanese troops on the Jinpu Railway Line are currently transporting grain and military supplies to Xuzhou, intending to invade westward. Japanese troops on the Nanxun Railway Line are forcibly conscripting laborers to repair roads, intending to invade Nanchang. The Chinese side has taken strict precautions in all of these areas. Chinese guerrilla forces in Hebei and Pingjin have launched successful counterattacks, and the situation has stabilized. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Reconnoitering over the Coastal Areas of Fujian</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) At noon on the 25th, three Japanese planes flew from Guangdong to observe various coastal areas. Over twenty counties in southeastern Fujian issued air raid alerts. At around 2 PM, the Japanese planes turned south and landed at Xiamen. (25th Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Air Force Suffers Heavy Losses</h3>
<p>More Than a Thousand Planes Lost in One and a Half Years</p>
<p>Location Undisclosed An air force spokesperson told reporters that, according to an announcement by the Japanese General Headquarters on January 20th of the 28th year, since the beginning of the war of aggression against China, up to December 30th of the 27th year, a total of 710 army and navy aircraft have been lost. In addition, there are 300 aircraft that were damaged beyond repair, for a total of 1,010 aircraft. This figure is consistent with the results of the statistics compiled by the Chinese side. Of these, 221 were shot down in the air by the Chinese air force, 179 were destroyed by the Chinese air force through bombing, 83 were shot down by Chinese anti-aircraft artillery, 107 were destroyed by Chinese army attacks, 11 were destroyed by Chinese artillery, 19 Japanese planes made forced landings, and 27 were shot down by the Chinese army and their whereabouts are unknown, or were seriously damaged and made forced landings in Japanese positions, for a total of 647 aircraft. Adding to this the conservatively estimated loss rate of 363 aircraft due to flight accidents (the actual number must be higher than this), the grand total is 1,010 aircraft, averaging more than 56 aircraft lost per month, which can be said to be a heavy loss. Since New Year's Day of the 28th year, 24 aircraft have already been shot down or destroyed by the Chinese air force, anti-aircraft artillery, and army units, of which the heroic Chinese air force fighters shot down 15 of the newest and most advanced heavy bombers recently purchased from Europe and the West over Lanzhou, inflicting a serious blow to the Japanese air force.

<h3>Japanese Military Headquarters Admits Failure of Lanzhou Air Raid</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a spokesman for the Japanese military headquarters, the third air raid on Lanzhou on the 23rd of this month was unsuccessful, with three Japanese planes being shot down and 18 air force soldiers being lost. Another plane, although able to fly back to its base, was hit by 153 bullets and has become a scrap heap. As for the Chinese losses, reports from various sources are still "contradictory" and need to be "sorted out" before they can be announced, it was said. (26th Express News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A spokesman for the Japanese army admitted yesterday at a reception for foreign journalists that three Japanese bombers and eighteen pilots were lost during the Japanese air raid on Lanzhou on the 23rd of this month. The spokesman went on to say that the remaining Japanese aircraft that returned to base had been hit by multiple bullets, and as a result, nine Japanese pilots were injured.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Suiyuan Are Weak</h3>
<p>Afraid of Attacks by Chinese Guerrilla Forces</p>
<p>Forcing Residents of Various Villages to Move</p>
<p>Hequ A person from Guisui said that the strength of the Japanese troops in Suiyuan city is currently very empty, and they are constantly afraid of attacks by Chinese guerrilla forces. Sandbags have been piled up in various remote alleys to block traffic, and fortifications have only been set up at thoroughfares and key passes. A broadcasting machine has been set up on the drum tower in the old city, and each village within a dozen miles of the suburbs has a dispatcher. In the event of an emergency, they immediately raise lights as a signal, and the broadcasting machine reports to the military and civilians in the two cities to quickly prepare for defense. Due to the insufficient distribution of troops, all Japanese and Korean merchants are engaged in business during the day and formed into guard teams at night. Due to the tight military budget, the Japanese recently convened a streamlining conference to drastically reduce the Mongolian puppet army. Although the troops of De Wang and Li Shouxin are nominally ten divisions, they actually number only a few thousand men. After being streamlined by the conference, they have been further reduced, and the Mongolian puppet troops are ordered to be separately organized and not to be mixed and linked, fearing that their strength will be too great and difficult to control. De, Li, and the Mongolian puppet army are very dissatisfied with this arrangement by the Japanese, and there is a possibility of unrest from time to time. The strength of the Japanese troops stationed in various counties is also extremely weak. Although they are transferred and moved from time to time, ostensibly to increase defenses and supplement troops, in reality it is a trick to show off and conceal their fear and anxiety. Politically, although the highest puppet organization is the Mongolian United Autonomous Government and the provincial government, with De Wang as a puppet, the Guisui Public Office is separately established, and the administrative power is purely controlled by the Japanese. The puppet county governments and police stations that were formerly organized by the Japanese using local gentry in various counties have recently been removed and replaced by their trusted Chinese traitors. This can be described as "when the cunning rabbit dies, the hunting dog is cooked," a lesson for opportunistic Chinese traitors. Because Chinese guerrilla forces are lurking in the suburbs of various county towns, the Japanese policies and orders are still difficult to leave the city gates, and they are at a loss. In recent months, the Japanese army has twice launched large-scale encirclements of Daqingshan, attempting to destroy the base of the Chinese guerrilla forces, but ultimately failed to achieve their wishes. Therefore, they have recently intensified their efforts to drive the residents of various villages along the Ping-Sui Railway Line and both sides of the road to relocate to areas designated by the Japanese army, and those who refuse to move are immediately slaughtered, intending to clear the fields to control the activities of Chinese guerrilla forces. This kind of desperate and futile action by the Japanese army is a waste of effort and ultimately cannot do anything about the Chinese army. (24th Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Jiaozuo Fleeing to Bo'ai</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) According to a telephone report from the front, at 10:00 AM on the 24th, over three hundred Japanese infantrymen and three mountain guns from Jiaozuo fled towards Bo'ai. When passing through Baiyue Village (over twenty miles east of Bo'ai), they were intercepted by local Chinese troops, who killed dozens of Japanese soldiers and seized three light machine guns and over a dozen rifles. The remaining Japanese troops fled in panic towards the south gate of Bo'ai. (26th Telegram)</p>
<h3>Purpose of Japanese Troops Invading Western Hubei</h3>
<p>To Consolidate the Ying-Zao Line to Defend Against Chinese Counterattacks</p>
<p>To Probe for Opportunities to Harass, Which Is of a Guerrilla Nature</p>
<p>Zhongxiang The purpose of the Japanese troops' decision to invade western Hubei is to support the security line in the southern part of the Ping-Han Railway and consolidate the defensive positions of the Ying-Zao defense line to prevent Chinese counterattacks. Although they have recently dispatched small numbers of troops to probe for opportunities to harass, this is also of a guerrilla nature. When Chinese troops counterattack, they retreat immediately. Currently, the front line on the right wing is still confronting each other near Yuekou and Xiachengyi. (26th Telegram)</p>
<p>Changde According to a telephone report from Huarong, a certain unit of Chinese guerrilla forces encountered Japanese soldiers at a certain place fifteen miles from Zhuhekou some days ago and engaged in a fierce battle. At that time, because the Japanese were numerous and the Chinese were few, the Chinese troops immediately dispersed and hid in the surrounding villages. Later, with the assistance of friendly forces, they launched simultaneously from various places and surrounded and severely suppressed the Japanese troops, achieving considerable gains. The remaining Japanese troops were defeated and fled in disarray back to Bailuoji. The Japanese troops who harassed Huahue Muqiao from Bailuoji were also repelled by the Chinese Jianli Self-Defense Corps. (26th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The battles on the Hanyi Highway became more intense again on the 23rd. Although the Japanese army has made considerable progress, the price they have paid is quite heavy. Military figures on the Chinese side here do not attach importance to the battles in that area, believing that the Japanese army has no ability to invade Yichang and Shashi to the west. It is said that the Japanese army is currently advancing in three routes, but each route consists of only a few hundred men, and their purpose is only to pressure the Chinese guerrilla forces in central Hubei to retreat westward in order to reduce the threat to Wuhan. At present, there are three locations where Chinese and Japanese troops are engaged in fierce fighting: one is Sanyangdian, north of Jingshan; one is the Nanshanmiao Qinglongshan area, southwest of Jingshan; and one is near Yuekou. A strong unit of the Chinese army launched an attack southward from Fenshuiling yesterday, and after three hours of fierce fighting, recaptured Qianjiafang, west of Zaoshi, cutting off the retreat of the Japanese troops in Wamiaoji. Another team of Chinese troops is currently advancing northward from Zhengjiatan, counterattacking Tianmen and threatening the Japanese troops' flank in Yuekou.

<h3>Yu Officials Never Considered Kita's Proposed "Dream" of Peace</h3>
<p>Japanese Intend to Use Forged "Three Principles of the People"</p>
<p>Kita's Peace Plan Is Not a Novel Event</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Since Chongqing received Kita's proposed peace plan, various parties have expressed sarcasm, ridicule, and extreme contempt. Officials who are well-versed in Japanese studies have issued the following comments: (1) Japan's adoption of Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People indicates that Japan has spiritually succumbed to China. Even Hiranuma and Itagaki have publicly discussed the Three Principles of the People in the Diet, indicating that the Japanese are considering using the Three Principles of the People and reinterpreting them. However, the Chinese people will never believe the "Three Principles of the People" manufactured by the Japanese. (2) Kita, as the leader of the special affairs organ in Beiping, is the first Japanese officer to publicly formulate a peace program. Tokyo has long had the intention of seeking peace. Initially, the puppet regime in Beiping came forward to call for peace, but to no avail. Currently, the Japanese are "impatiently waiting" for a peace settlement, so they personally put forward a peace proposal. (3) Although Wang Jingwei has an inclination towards peace, Kuomintang figures believe that he will certainly not participate in the so-called Kuomintang government in Nanjing. (4) The so-called invitation to Chiang Kai-shek to join the Nanjing regime is "an absolute insult to China, and China and the Chinese people will never consider accepting such an insult." (5) According to unconfirmed reports, Kita has opposed preparing for war against China since the beginning of the war, so he tried to prevent the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident, but failed. Kita's wife is Chinese, so he is quite knowledgeable about Chinese affairs, and he is also good at writing in Chinese. Tokyo's choice of him as a person to seek peace is indeed a success. However, the error in the Japanese's new peace plan is that they do not know that the Chinese people are not easily deceived by a fake Kuomintang and a reinterpreted Three Principles of the People. (6) Chongqing has not only not considered Kita's "dream," but Chinese experts on Japanese studies have warned the people of the whole country for months that the Japanese are conspiring to organize a new Kuomintang. Therefore, Kita's peace plan is no longer a novel event in the eyes of the people in Chongqing. (26th Associated Press Telegram)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>End of the Spanish Civil War</h3>
<p>Today will be a day worth mentioning in world history</p>
<p>The governments of Great Britain and France will simultaneously announce today the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government as the legitimate government of Spain. The Foreign Minister of the Spanish Republican government, Mr. Alvarez, went to France yesterday to visit Mr. Azaña, the President of the Spanish Republican government who is a guest in Paris, to report that the Republican government's cabinet meeting had decided to accept the advice of Great Britain and France to stop the war. Mr. Azaña also decided to announce his resignation and step down when Great Britain and France announced their recognition of the Nationalist government. The Spanish Civil War has thus come to an end. The Spanish Civil War lasted for more than thirty-one months; its impact: not only has the fate of Spain been changed to another stage, but also the overall situation in Western Europe and the state of the Mediterranean have been turbulent and dangerous due to the Spanish Civil War, creating an important catalyst for international war and pushing the international community to the peak of the watershed between peace and war; thereafter, the ebb and flow of British and French power with that of Germany and Italy, the ebb and flow of the division between democracy and autocracy, the ebb and flow of international political ideas of maintaining the international status quo with peace and changing the international status quo with force, we do not need to mix any subjectivity to discuss their strengths and weaknesses, distinguish their good and bad, identify their advantages and disadvantages, and judge their destination, but it will inevitably have its own ebb and flow and be very different from the past, so it is also a key to decide whether the Spanish Civil War is brewing or dissipating or growing. Since the impact is so profound and it lasted so long, today's end of the civil war is a symbol for historians to draw a period. Recalling the past thirty-one months, news about the war never stopped; the number of changes was so frequent that it was difficult to record them all. As it is a major event in modern times, it should not be regarded as fleeting clouds. Let's try to briefly describe its outline, if the reader does not think the language is superfluous.</p>
<p>On July 17, 1936, the troops stationed in Melilla, a place in northern Morocco on the Mediterranean coast, which is the African territory of the Spanish Republic, launched an uprising. This was the beginning of the Spanish Civil War. The head of state at the time was President Azaña, who decided to step down today; the leader of the rebels at the time was General Franco, who today obtained the recognition of Great Britain, France, and other countries as the legitimate government of Spain. Five days earlier, Mr. Sotelo, the leader of the extreme right-wing political family of the Royalist Party, was assassinated, and the government re-searched for right-wing figures on a large scale. The fuse of the civil war was actually tied to this. Originally, Spanish politics had long been in a state of decline, and the left and right wings had been incompatible for a long time. Although the Popular Front of the left wing was in power, its prestige was not enough to suppress the whole country. Therefore, the starting point of one corner responded to the four sides, and the fact that it was finally overthrown was due to complicated reasons, but it is undeniable that its own fragility was particularly severe. There are many historical facts about any country that fights a civil war due to internal strife. It is only a matter of brothers fighting each other, and the winner is the king, but it is not what is said in Spain. From the day the Spanish Civil War began, the international community was already in turmoil. Because Spain is not strong among the European countries, but because of its geographical relationship, it can be important, so those who compete for hegemony in Europe are competing for Spain for their own use; the political magnates of that country can also form foreign aid. Therefore, in peacetime, the machinations and traces of the horse's feet could not conceal its international background. Once the short soldiers were engaged, the picture was revealed. Less than half a month after the uprising in Morocco, it was reported that Italian military aircraft had joined the Nationalist army; although Rome did not admit it at the time, those who knew a little about the international situation had already asserted that it must not be false. Germany and Italy were in cahoots, while Great Britain, France, the Soviet Union, and other countries intended to protect the Republican government and confront Germany and Italy. In the parliaments of various countries, they publicly took sides with both sides of the Spanish Civil War according to their beliefs. Therefore, the thirty-one months of bloodshed, although it was a civil war in one country, was no less than an epitome of European international relations.</p>
<p>The indirect struggle gradually became an open confrontation; the fact that it did not expand and spread to become the Second World War was a matter of great urgency. On August 1 of this year, the French government suggested to Great Britain and Italy that all countries should remain neutral in the Spanish civil war; there were intrigues, deceptions, and twists and turns, and it took a month to gradually get on track. On September 9, the International Adjustment Committee on the issue of non-interference in the Spanish Civil War held its first decision-making meeting, with twenty-six countries participating. From then on, those who were sincere in their work either blocked the border, or prohibited their people from going to Spain to join the army, or prohibited the transportation of military supplies to Spain, which ultimately became the main factor in the defeat of the Spanish Republican government. Others initially feigned compliance and then blatantly broke their promises, with volunteers, airplanes, and artillery continuously arriving, ultimately becoming the main backing for the victory of the Spanish Nationalist army. The fact that there is today's outcome after thirty-one months cannot be said to be due to the nominal existence of the Adjustment Committee. However, the Adjustment Committee also had a great effect; if there had been no organization of the Adjustment Committee, reducing friction at the beginning and repeatedly buffering in between, they would have been forced to enter the vortex together; then the victory or defeat of the two armies in Spain, although different from today, the state of the entire international community is not what it can be imagined today.</p>
<p>The Spanish Civil War is about to end, but its own development has not ended, and the international evolution caused by it has not ended; whether it becomes more tense or gradually opens up, each has its own possibilities, which needs to be answered by facts and cannot be foreseen.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Strong Reply to Japan</h3>
<p>Japanese Authorities Hold Meeting</p>
<p>Decided to Issue Another Note Today</p>
<p>After the Japanese representative filed a protest with the Municipal Council a few days ago regarding the terrorist atrocities, Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General of the Municipal Council, sent a reply to the Japanese authorities on Saturday, but the contents have not been revealed. It is heard that the wording is quite firm. According to the Allied News Agency, Japanese army, navy, and consular personnel met on the flagship "Izumo" yesterday afternoon for three hours. It is expected that the Japanese side will send another note to the Council today. It is heard that the resolution agreed upon during the talks by Japanese personnel will be included in the note to be sent today. At the same time, patrol teams in various districts of the Public Concession continue to patrol in the rain. Search teams are checking people coming from Pudong on the Bund, and search teams in the western district have been checking buses coming from the west and east since the invasion this morning. Although the inspections were slightly more relaxed during the happy hour in the middle of the day, it is heard that they continued until late last night. Coolies from the Public Works Department have completed the erection of barbed wire in the central district, and yesterday they closed various street alleys in the Chengdu Road district. Work has also begun in the Jing'an Temple district, and the streets outside the concession that are bordered by the non-concession area will also be completely equipped with barbed wire to prevent illegal elements from entering the Public Concession. This kind of preparedness to deal with terrorist cases has never been seen before, and the western district is the most heavily guarded. No puppet personnel have been assassinated in the past five days.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, a spokesman for the Nanjing "Reformed Government" declared that we must now declare a "silent declaration of war" on the Shanghai Public Concession and British and French ships. Their actions are nothing more than expanding the concession and using the Yangtze River as a base to help the Chiang Kai-shek regime. The government has transferred troops and militia to be stationed around the concession to prevent the continued occurrence of terrorist demonstrations. If Britain and France do not reconsider and change their attitude regarding assistance to the Chiang regime, then we will not hesitate to regard the British and French forces in the Public Concession as enemies. The news also stated that the Japanese authorities in Shanghai are obviously dissatisfied with the plan taken by the Municipal Council, calling it a cold plan, and that they consider the Municipal Council's reply to the Japanese request to be the same. The Japanese authorities are holding an emergency meeting today to determine the final steps to deal with the overall situation. (26th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>Guerrilla Forces Control North China</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Since the Japanese army launched the large-scale "Purification" campaign in North China, it has been nearly a year, and the result can be said to be a complete failure, because in North China, except for a few transportation lines, the remaining ninety percent is still under the jurisdiction of the Chinese guerrillas. According to the Japanese authorities here, areas around Datong-Puzhou, Shijiazhuang, and Taiyuan, as well as the border areas of Hebei and Shandong and the border areas of Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi, are all "dangerous areas" that are beyond the reach of the Japanese army or the decrees of the "provisional government."

When the Japanese troops arrived in Nangong city, there was no rice or firewood, and even water was nowhere to be found. The Chinese troops also cut off the Japanese troops' supplies, so after several days, the Japanese troops could not stand their ground and fled in full force, with heavy losses of ammunition.

<h3>Japanese Control of Transportation in North China</h3>
<p>Japanese Troops Occupy Railways Within Areas</p>

The cash to be paid by the "Provisional Government" and the South Manchuria Railway will be fully collected by the end of this fiscal year in late March, with another quarter to be collected in the next fiscal year. All public bus routes in North China and Inner Mongolia will be operated by the company. However, it is still undecided whether the Longhai Railway, which is currently partially occupied by the Japanese army, will also be under the company's control. Usami, the current head of the North China branch of the South Manchuria Railway, will be appointed as the president of the company. Goto, the former director of the Tokyo Municipal Electric Bureau, will be appointed as one of the vice presidents, and another vice president will be a Chinese person.

<h3>Spanish Civil War Ends, Government Forces Accept Peace, President Azaña Prepares to Resign, Nationalist Forces Express Generosity</h3>

The Republican government's Foreign Minister, Tal Faruyut, recently came here to talk with the country's President Azaña for a long time. According to sources from this place, Foreign Minister Tal Faruyut reported to the President that the Internal Affairs Conference has decided to accept the British government's recommendation to stop the war in order to negotiate with the Nationalist forces to end the civil war.

As of now, President Azaña has not announced his resignation, and it is possible that he will wait until tomorrow to leave.

According to responsible sources here, Pellier said General Franco, commander-in-chief of the Spanish Nationalist forces, agreed to allow refugees and political exiles from the country to return to their homeland in a generous spirit, based on humanitarianism. As for the content of the agreement signed by both sides, the two governments will issue a joint communique on the 27th of this month to provide an explanation, but the full text of the agreement will not be published for the time being.

<p>(London) Key figures from the Church of England and the Free Churches, such as the Archbishop of York and the Bishop of Southwark, recently sent a joint letter to Foreign Secretary Halifax, requesting the government to make the Spanish Nationalist government's amnesty of political prisoners a condition for recognition, stating that "based on various reasons," they anticipate that General Franco will use cruel means to retaliate against those who resisted the Nationalist forces. Therefore, if the UK grants recognition and helps him carry out retaliation, it will leave a stain on the conscience of the British people. In short, "if the government can urge the Spanish Nationalist government to issue an amnesty decree, thereby ending the civil war early, and preventing harm to commercial or political interests, it is also a matter of unavoidable responsibility."

The British government will issue invitations through the king's representative. Not only will representatives from Balestine and Great Britain be invited, but also constitutional experts. It is heard that the British representatives will have representatives from the opposition party, in order to place the future of Balestine policy above party politics. Many believe that the British government will express its willingness to see Balestine establish an autonomous government, but it does not advocate its immediate construction.

<h3>Italy Wants to Woo Poland to Weaken French Influence, Polish Foreign Minister Hosts Banquet for Ciano, France Reiterates Determination to Uphold Territory</h3>
<p>Warsaw: After Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived here, he recently paid a visit to Prime Minister General Sklagowski, General Smigly-Ritz, Inspector General of the Army Education, and Foreign Minister Pakorski in the afternoon. In the evening, Foreign Minister Pakorski hosted a banquet to entertain him, and both sides made speeches at the table, praising the friendship between Italy and Poland. Foreign Minister Pakorski first traced the course of cooperation between the two countries and then said, "The friendship between our two countries is not only a historical memory. At this time when your country is moving towards the path of development, in addition to striving to strengthen ourselves, our country is willing to maintain and enhance the friendship between our two countries. I would like to take this opportunity to express my humble intentions in a more direct and frank manner." Foreign Minister Ciano immediately replied, "Fascist Italy has a deep friendship with your country. Your country has occupied a lofty position among the major countries of the world due to its unremitting efforts, which is especially sympathized with by Italy. I hope that the results of this trip can further enhance this friendship and sympathy." (25th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>Warsaw: After Italian Foreign Minister Ciano arrived here, he recently laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the afternoon, but half an hour before that, a large number of citizens held an anti-German demonstration there, shouting "Down with Hitler!" "Down with the German Pigs!" and shouting in French "Long Live the Franco-Polish Alliance!" "Long Live France!" However, this demonstration did not oppose Italy. Many university students also cheered and saluted Ciano in front of the Italian embassy. (25th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) If the relationship between Italy and France in the Mediterranean becomes increasingly tense, what attitude will Poland take? This is the current mystery. Recently, the famous journalist Gaida (who has accompanied Foreign Minister Ciano to Warsaw) published an article in the semi-official Italian newspaper, inferring that "Although Poland has a treaty of alliance with France, it is also a friend of Italy. Its allegiance between France and Italy can be studied based on two points. It is also a standard for determining compliance: historical factors, the first one. Poland is farsighted and strives to become a hero, and its natural interests lie, the first one. To these two, we do not eagerly expect Poland to give a definite and unswerving answer, nor do we hope that Poland will accept any constraints. What we are asking for today is only to understand its current views and attitudes. Foreign Minister Ciano's meeting with Polish Foreign Minister Pakorski has a general nature, and the purpose is threefold: 1. Relations with Germany; 2. Political and economic adjustments in the Danube River basin; 3. Based on Germany's demand for the return of old colonies and the wishes of the Italian nation, establish a new balance in Europe and lay the foundation for peace. In these three, Italy and Poland have common and intricate relationships. In Italy, the basis of the current policy lies in cooperation with Germany in military, political, social, and cultural aspects, and it is also in harmony with the Italian-German Axis everywhere. As far as Poland is concerned, since its reconciliation with Germany, Italy's friendship with Poland has not only increased, but it also believes that Poland's move should be developed. In short, the interests of Germany, Italy, and Poland in the Danube River basin are different but converge to the same goal. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that Foreign Minister Ciano's visit to Poland is a preliminary development of the frank cooperation between Germany, Italy, Poland, and the countries in the Danube River basin."

<p>Goudan, France: Foreign Minister Pong Lai recently gave a speech here, saying, "The French colonial empire was created by red blood and labor and cannot be interfered with by others. Sovereignty and territory must be fully protected by France and cannot be infringed upon by others." Regarding the relationship between France and Germany, the two sides issued a declaration of peace on December 6 last year, which became the first step for the two countries to increase their friendship. Therefore, there are no longer any border disputes with each other. Regarding the relationship between Britain and France, after British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax delivered speeches in the British upper and lower houses, the friendship and spirit of cooperation between the two countries were further strengthened. As for Spain, France is willing to maintain good neighborly relations with it to avoid the need for competitive border defense on its southern border, so it has decided to send an ambassador to Burgos, Spain. In short, "France's current foreign policy is to increase friendship with all its neighbors." (26th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Arsenal Greatly Increases Female Workers</h3>

<h3>German Authorities Deny Sending Troops to Africa, British Businessmen to Visit Berlin Next Month with a Political Mission</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Manchester Guardian reported that German troops were being sent to Libya, which was denied by the German authorities yesterday, dismissing it as bizarre and absurd. The Havas News Agency's correspondent also failed to find any trace of German troops being sent to Libya or Italian East Africa. They were instructed to have the Havas staff in Italy investigate, but nothing was found. The German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the People's Observer, saying that foreign newspapers have recently been spreading rumors, saying that Hitler had recently sent officers to Abyssinia to train the colonial people to fight, which is like seeing a bow reflected in a cup, unworthy of laughter by those in the know. (Havas News Agency telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The Minister of Commerce Stanley and the Overseas Trade Minister Hudson are scheduled to come to Berlin next month to consult with the German authorities and participate in the talks between the British and German industry delegations. This trip carries a political mission, with the intention of promoting Germany's return to the international economic system, so as to develop economic cooperation and complete the work of political appeasement. This is Prime Minister Chamberlain's wish, and he is eager to complete it. According to people in the Prime Minister's residence on Downing Street, the Prime Minister believes that the German leader Hitler's speech to the Reichstag on January 30, in which he talked about rapidly increasing exports, has opened a path, and we must take advantage of it to move forward to success. Once the head of the Economic Department of the Foreign Office, Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, returns from Berlin on the 27th and reports on the talks, the British Cabinet can use this as a basis to issue detailed instructions to Stanley and Hudson, ordering them to work hard to reach an agreement with Germany on trade methods and foreign commodity prices, and to clearly inform the German authorities that the British export credit guarantee system is efficient. If the negotiations between Britain and Germany fail, it will not be difficult for the German export industry to go bankrupt. Britain's attitude is so frank and will make concessions as a means of appeasement. It is hoped that the German side can also show the same attitude so that an agreement can be reached, and the European situation will be greatly eased. Prime Minister Chamberlain's policy will also achieve full success due to the end of the Spanish Civil War and the conclusion of a commercial agreement between Britain and Germany, and he can bring forward the general election of the House of Commons this autumn. (The term of the current House of Commons must last until 1940) He will ask the people to vote to support the Conservative Party, so that it can solve the unemployment problem with all its strength. The method may often copy part of the original plan of the Labour Party, which is not certain. As for the former Foreign Secretary Eden, it is said that he will rejoin the cabinet before the general election and serve as the Home Secretary. (Havas News Agency telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) International situation is currently commented on by political figures here, saying that the end of the Spanish Civil War may not be the beginning of international cooperation, or it may become a new crisis, with signs of an outbreak in mid-May. To this day, the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact have launched a large-scale movement to transform the world situation. The various conditions that exist are all ready. The major ones are: (1) Since the new government of Spain is a friendly country of the totalitarian countries, these countries occupy a great strategic advantage in Western Europe, and the imperial transportation lines of Britain and France are also threatened in the Atlantic Ocean and the waters of the Balearic Islands. (2) After Japan controls southern China and Hainan Island, it can put pressure on the territories held by Britain and France in Asia. (3) The totalitarian countries are doing their best to encourage Poland, and even instigate the National Army government of Spain to covet certain colonies in North Africa. (4) The Italian government ordered the conscription of a batch of reserve soldiers and sent a large number of troops to Libya in North Africa to increase defenses. (5) The German government mobilized new recruits at all levels in batches for training, and systematically expanded its influence in Southeast Europe in political and economic terms. The totalitarian countries are sharpening their swords in this situation. Fortunately, Britain and France can also systematically clear up the international haze. For example, British Foreign Secretary Halifax and French Prime Minister Daladier have repeatedly and firmly stated that the two countries maintain full joint relations. Britain and France are expanding their military equipment with great efforts and purchasing aircraft from the United States to make up for the lack of domestic production. Secondly, they recognized the National Army of Spain as the legitimate government to offset the power held by Germany and Italy in Spain. Thirdly, Germany tried to establish economic hegemony in Eastern Europe, while Britain and France worked hard to resist it in order to maintain the original market. Fourthly, the anti-German tendencies of Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary, and Poland are becoming more and more obvious. Among them, the Hungarian government has dissolved the National Socialist Party, and anti-German demonstrations have occurred in Poland for days. Furthermore, the economic activities of Britain and France are even more powerful. The weakness of Germany lies in the fact that its industry has become a war industry. Now, if it wants to change to peacetime industry, it is technically very difficult. The production mechanism must be changed. After the production is adjusted, it is still necessary to find a way out, which cannot be done by Germany alone. Therefore, Britain and France want to negotiate with it on this issue, so as to live in peace with each other. It is hoped that this negotiation can be completed, so as to find a general solution to the various problems that threaten peace. This is the blessing of Europe and the benefit of the world situation. (Havas News Agency telegram on the 25th)</p>

There are about 1,000,000 Italian overseas Chinese in France. As of now, only 10,000 have returned to the country. There are 20,000 Italian overseas Chinese in Corsica, France, and only 700 have returned to the country. (Havas News Agency telegram on the 25th)</p>

<h3>Papal Election to Take at Least Four Days</h3>
<p>Vatican City The election of a new pope will take at least about four days. At that time, the cardinals will be isolated from the outside world. People in Rome have a lot of speculation about the candidate for the new pope. If the elected person is Italian, the two trends of freedom and conservatism in the church will inevitably conflict. Cardinals Basile, who advocates freedom, and Bichetlani, who advocates conservatism, are both supported. If the Archbishop of Florence, Della Torre, is elected as the new emperor, it will create a legend, but all kinds of speculation may be wrong. It is also possible that the elected person is a lesser-known figure among the cardinals. (Reuters telegram on the 26th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Advises Labor Unions to Reconcile</h3>
<p>Hyannis Port The temporary office set up by the President's Office in this city recently released a message stating that President Roosevelt (currently observing naval exercises in the Caribbean Sea) sent a letter to William Green, president of the American Federation of Labor, and John L. Lewis, president Industrial Organizations, today, telling them that "The people of the country deeply hope that the Labor Federation and the Industrial Organizations can resolve their differences and reconcile and establish an honorable peace in the next few months. After Ms. Perkins, the Minister of Labor, thoroughly discussed with the leaders of your association recently, she deeply believes that the two major labor groups have no insurmountable difficulties in cooperating, and it is in line with the wishes of all parties concerned. It is hoped that your association can separately appoint representatives to form a joint committee to discuss cooperation methods." The American labor union organization has been divided into two factions, one is the American Federation of Labor led by Green, and the other is the Industrial Organizations led by Lewis. They have been confronting each other for a long time. President Roosevelt advocated unifying the national labor union organization in mid-October last year, and Ms. Perkins, the Minister of Labor, also advocated the establishment of a committee to come forward and mediate so that the two factions can reconcile. This committee will be composed of 16 members. In addition to the Industrial Organizations and the American Federation of Labor each sending five representatives, the government will appoint six non-partisan people to participate in it. (Havas News Agency telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt again issued an appeal to the leaders of the American Federation of Labor and the Industrial Organizations, asking them to release their grievances and reconcile. Political figures commented on this, saying, "The Nermy government wants to improve its relationship with the major industrialists on the one hand, and wants to promote the mutual relationship between labor and capital and the government on the other hand. The reason why the President again issued an application to the two major labor unions is this. However, the Industrial Organizations and the American Federation of Labor have had long-standing differences, and it seems impossible to reconcile. The spiritual impact of this act by the President is more than the actual effect. The President has temporarily abandoned the legislative path and changed to private contact methods to consult with all parties concerned in order to eliminate various obstacles to economic recovery. He then sent an application to the leaders of the American Federation of Labor and the Industrial Organizations. (Regarding the principles of labor union organization, the American Federation of Labor advocates using the profession as the unit, and the Industrial Organizations advocates using the entire factory as the unit). According to news from New York, the President of the American Federation of Labor, Green, has expressed his acceptance of this request from President Roosevelt.

<h3>Danzig Café Notice: "Dogs and Poles Not Allowed"</h3>
<p>Danzig: Today, German students staged a demonstration in front of a Polish student hostel, but they were dispersed by the police.

This was purely a prank by German students, but the Polish students were greatly displeased and held a meeting to discuss countermeasures. The speakers were very passionate. German students then wore Nazi Party uniforms and staged a demonstration to protest against the impassioned speeches of the Polish students. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Sexual Hygiene</p>
<h3>Physical Unhealthiness Leads to Numbness and Insensitivity</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Russian Labor University Medical School</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, human prosperity cannot exist apart from reproduction. If we want to seek happiness for ourselves and the nation, then we should openly discuss reproduction in order to achieve perfection. Uncivilized and uncultured peoples only know about reproduction and do not know that there is a problem of love involved within reproduction. I can also say that reproduction without love leads to numbness and insensitivity, and even hemiplegia. Only sexual satisfaction and sexual harmony can promote prosperity and evolution. This is undeniable.</p>
<p>Therefore, if you want to generate love in reproduction, you must study the wisdom of love in order to achieve a unified state of beauty.</p>
<p>However, in reality, no matter how profound your wisdom or how smooth your methods of seeking love, if you lack a healthy physique, it is like a headless snake. Moreover, the source of love must be the mutual coordination between husband and wife. These points require abundant energy to succeed. To achieve this kind of expectation, men must maintain chastity before marriage, and sexual energy must not be abused. If a person's energy is dissipated in debauchery for a time, it can cause the youth gland that governs sexual desire to age prematurely, and diseases such as the inability to reproduce will arise as a result, and from then on, it will not be possible to be consistent with the wife's emotional tide.</p>
<p>The union of husband and wife is for the purpose of seeking love. Kidney deficiency is the main reason for hindering the other party's emotional upsurge, so the goal cannot be achieved, so there is no gain in both reproduction and pleasure.</p>
<p>Regarding the progression of this disease, there is a certain procedure. If you usually feel weak and have nocturnal emissions or involuntary ejaculation when seeing a sexually attractive person, you should pay special attention. Or, the local erectile strength is not different, but there is undoubtedly kidney deficiency. If there is no health preservation or indulgence, the erectile strength will be lost and there will be complete impotence. Now that medicine is advancing, endocrine agents of the youth gland have been invented for this disease, such as "Buti Kang," a male animal testicular essence preparation produced in Germany, which is indeed a good medicine for the symptoms. After taking it, the mind is clear, the spirit is invigorated, the complexion is ruddy, the appetite is increased, and the sexual function is very healthy, with no pathological conditions such as kidney deficiency and impotence. It can also promote reproductive function and help the development of sexual organs, so this agent has been praised by countless Chinese and foreign doctors and is happy to introduce it to couples with weak love. This is truly the omnipotence of science.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Nocturnal Emission and Neurasthenia</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, Doctor of Medicine from Germany</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is the most common cause of neurasthenia. However, most types of nocturnal emission are caused by excessive masturbation, so those with a masturbation habit almost all suffer from this problem, because masturbation can directly destroy the human youth gland, causing the seminal vesicle to lose its control. Therefore, the more deficient a person is, the more frequent their nocturnal emissions. The more frequent the nocturnal emissions, the more rapidly the body moves towards weakness. If left untreated, the disease will spread like a flood, and pathological conditions will be found in the three nervous systems of the brain, sex, and spinal cord. Furthermore, when young people are in the midst of development, if they suffer from this kind of worrying disease, it will naturally affect their development.</p>
<p>Therefore, young people should seek treatment as soon as they have nocturnal emissions, and masturbation should be abstained from. Regarding the correction of masturbation, it is necessary to use methods of clearing the mind and reducing desires to improve one's morality. It must be known that masturbation is the most shameful and despicable behavior, which can stain a pure soul, and on the other hand, it is necessary to take the special medicine for nocturnal emission, "Naires Nocturnal Emission Tablets," to stop nocturnal emission. It is necessary not only to stop nocturnal emission in a short period of time, but also to sleep peacefully. If you also supplement with "Buti Kang" at the same time, the function of metabolism will be promoted, and the brain will be strengthened and the spirit will be rejuvenated.</p>

<h3>Thorough and Rapid Cure for Leukorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Huang Zhongchang, Doctor of Medicine from the United States</p>
<p>No matter what the disease, treatment should be rapid, and it is absolutely impossible to prolong it and allow the disease to spread, resulting in a difficult-to-treat situation. I have been studying gonorrhea for several decades. When I was studying in the United States, I paid attention to the root cause of this disease. I know deeply that the reproductive power of gonococcus is far greater than that of general inferior bacteria, so it should be treated quickly, so as not to cause other changes. In terms of treatment methods, it is not only necessary to adopt a rapid treatment policy, but also to achieve the words "thorough and rapid." In other words, do not seek frost-like rapid recovery, but seek safe and rapid recovery. The quick recovery of frost often leads to great future troubles, which is equivalent to mistreatment. Only the rapid method of thorough and rapid recovery, which achieves safe and reliable healing and does not have the bad sequelae caused by adverse side effects, can be called a perfect treatment method.</p>
<p>For general leukorrhea patients, two weeks after contracting gonorrhea, the gonococcus will flow into the blood. Although only the symptoms of gonococcus are seen on the surface, internal gonococcus prostatitis, epididymitis, cystitis, and female fallopian tube occlusion often occur. As a result, more than 90% of them are at risk of infertility. Therefore, patients with gonorrhea must adopt perfect and perfect treatment methods, which are necessary conditions for treating gonorrhea.</p>
<p>According to the experience of scholars from various countries and my own experience over the years, only the method of increasing white blood cells and immune antitoxin treatment can cause the blood cells to phagocytize bacteria vigorously, resulting in the gonococcus having nowhere to hide. Only "Kelinnong," invented by Dr. Peter of Germany, can be worthy of the above conditions. This agent is made by mixing refined yellow pigment protein. All acute and superior gonorrhea, such as prostatitis, orchitis, arthritis, cystitis, anterior and posterior urethritis, etc., can be cured by taking the medicine "Kelinnong." Because after taking this medicine for the above-mentioned types of gonorrhea, non-specific anti-gonococcus toxins can be produced to attack the gonococcus, so all gonococcus will be quickly cured and there will never be a recurrence. As for external medicine, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is the best. Patients can wash the urethra at home according to the pictures and instructions to remove the gonococcus on the mucous membrane. Women can use "Kaxuedi Vaginal Tablets" externally as suppositories to achieve even faster results. Only by using this treatment method to eradicate gonococcus, like wind sweeping away fallen leaves, can we thoroughly kill bacteria, and treatment methods that have side effects are not comparable. This is why it has long won the praise of international medical experts. (According to "Anti-Gonorrhea Water," both Zhongxi Taihe and the two major music rooms sell it.)</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Lecture</p>

<h3>New Decision for Treating Leukorrhea!</h3>
<p>Cannot be based on empty words. Gonorrhea is a disease that is very difficult to cure completely, so it is useless to rely on empty words. However, in recent years, the treatment of gonorrhea has long abandoned the general outdated treatment methods and replaced them with scientific treatment methods. For example, most people only recognize gonorrhea as a urethral disease. This statement has long been outdated, because the meaning of the word gonorrhea, whether in China or abroad, refers to the phenomenon of a liquid flowing out of the urethra. However, I don't know that this statement is only obtained by relying on the naked eye, so the ancients only focused on the local urethra when treating gonorrhea, and they were inevitably short-sighted. However, later, due to scientific progress, I learned that although gonococcus mostly invades the urethra, its development does not stop at the urethra, because gonococcus is good at fleeing. It is often hidden in the depths of the tissues and can also flee into the blood, muscles and bones, so local surgical treatment and treatment methods that thoroughly kill it are completely scratching the surface and are useless stupid acts. Therefore, most advanced doctors now do not pay much attention to urethral therapy, but regard it as a secondary auxiliary therapy.</p>
<p>Emphasis on internal medicine: Experts from various countries believe that German static electricity therapy is the most effective treatment for gonorrhea. Its electrothermal transmission sterilization power has a large range. It can not only kill gonococcus in the tissues, but also eliminate the deep gonococcus inside the urethra. However, "Kelinnong" in internal medicine has also long been valued by experts. Therefore, the germicidal power of this agent is extremely wide and deep. If it can be used with static electricity therapy, there is a chance of victory in eradicating gonorrhea. This is a particularly effective treatment that is unanimously recognized by gonorrhea experts in modern times. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Starting today, 20 numbers will be sent out every day, and each number will only cost 5 jiao.</p>
<h3>Experience in Treating Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Once a person is unfortunately afflicted with pulmonary tuberculosis, he will first lose the courage to resist the disease demon because he overbelieves that lung disease is a terminal illness. On the contrary, it makes the disease worse day by day, making the treatment lose its due effect, which is a pity. In my more than 20 years of personal experience, I have treated no less than thousands of cases of tuberculosis. Unless the body feels very weak, it can be cured. However, the treatment methods are also making amazing progress from time to time as science is advancing day by day, such as the "One Lung Nare" drug invented by Dr. Mei of Germany, which can indeed be the only internal medicine agent that every tuberculosis patient can protect. All symptoms of chronic cough, hemoptysis, night sweats, and first, second, and third stage other types of lung diseases can be treated by taking it, so "Defei Nare" is the only internal medicine agent for all lung diseases.</p>

<h3>Due to Repeated Incidents in the Shanghai Concessions, Japan Hopes to Increase Police Personnel, Attempting to Expand Its Scope of Duties, Opinions of Spokesperson of the Japanese Naval Ministry</h3>
<p>The Tokyo correspondent for the Zi Lin Bao reported on February 23rd: This morning, Rear Admiral Kanazawa, a spokesperson for the Naval Ministry here, told reporters that anti-Japanese terrorism in Shanghai is very rampant. The proper way to deal with the Shanghai situation is to appoint a Japanese person as the Chief Inspector of the Municipal Council's Police Department to completely control the organization. Kanazawa strongly criticized the poor organization and general ineffectiveness of the Police Department, one of its obvious shortcomings being the position of Japanese Assistant Police Commissioner Akagi. Akagi only manages the Japanese police directly under his control and has no real authority to manage general policing as a Deputy Police Commissioner should. The naval spokesperson also sternly criticized the Municipal Council for not paying attention to the overall situation and for not making real efforts to thoroughly handle affairs. According to news reports, an official of the Municipal Council even rashly referred to a certain terrorist case as a love affair between Japanese people. The Japanese Naval Ministry sees the terrorist demonstrations in the Public Concession and the French Concession as inhumane movements carried out by the Chiang regime, the purpose of which is threefold: to attempt to prevent the peace restoration movement that is now broadcasting throughout China, to attempt to strengthen cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party, and to hope to provoke disputes between Japan and the United Kingdom, etc. The Japanese government has now instructed the Japanese authorities in Shanghai to take a tough stance and take fundamental steps to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Preventing the continued occurrence of direct anti-Japanese political assassinations, one of the most effective and important ways is to increase the number of Japanese personnel in the Public Concession's Police Department and expand their duties, and to place a Japanese police officer in charge of the entire Public Concession Police Department, which is the most reasonable solution. Lieutenant Colonel Takano also strongly criticized the Police Department in this regard, saying that the proportion of Japanese police personnel is much smaller than the proportion of Japanese residents, the Chinese police organization is poor and very ineffective, they have no system of warning lines and no way to communicate or report alarms to each police station, only the general police station can be contacted. Under the current system, Japanese personnel can only serve as Deputy Police Commissioner or Assistant Police Commissioner, but this position can only manage the Japanese police under their control and cannot obtain information from other parts of the Police Department, and cannot manage other police officers such as the Chinese police in an emergency. If the police officers other than the Japanese police do their duty and cooperate effectively with the Japanese police, such terrorist atrocities would never occur repeatedly in the Public Concession, and the perpetrators would never be able to escape to a safe place.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Shanghai-Chongqing Journey via Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guizhou, The Entire Journey Takes About Twenty Days, The Travel Expenses Are More Economical Than by Sea</h3>
<p>It has been reported repeatedly that the Shanghai-Chongqing journey via Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Guizhou is the most appropriate and economical. The reporter followed this route to Sichuan, but because of the extraordinary period, changes are frequent. The previous reports are not without places that are outdated. Therefore, the reporter will describe the details of this experience later for future reference.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Chongqing Transportation: There are five routes from Shanghai to Chongqing: From Shanghai via Hong Kong, Haiphong, Kunming, Guiyang to Chongqing; From Shanghai via Ningbo or Wenzhou, Jinan, Zhuzhou, Hengyang, Guilin, Liuzhou, Guiyang to Chongqing; From Zhuzhou via Changsha, Changde, Lixian, Shashi to Yichang, take a boat upstream to Chongqing; From Zhuzhou via Changsha, Changde, Yuanling, Luxi, Yongshui, Xiushan, Qianjiang, Pengshui, Nanchuan, Qijiang to Chongqing; From Zhuzhou via Changsha, Changde, Yuanling, Chenxi, Huangxian, Huangping, Guiyang to Chongqing. The route that the reporter took is the last one. The reason for choosing this route over other routes was not a predetermined plan, but a temporary decision due to various problems. However, not going through Hong Kong and Haiphong was decided before departure.</p>
<p>Situation en route: From Shanghai to Wenzhou by sea, the journey is only 24 hours, but due to being stranded on sand in the middle of the journey and not being allowed to enter at night, it was delayed by 12 hours. After arriving in Wenzhou, the inspection was extremely strict. There were as many as 12 classes of Italian soldiers, customs, and tax bureaus. All tax-evading goods were confiscated, and prohibited items were subject to criminal law. Moreover, landing was not allowed without a guarantor. If you are not prepared in advance, you will be at a loss for a while, and some will even return to Shanghai on the original ship. This matter is related to national defense, so you must be prepared carefully. The reporter had credentials, stayed overnight in Wenzhou, and the next morning went to the highway bureau to buy a ticket to Lishui. Before dawn, those waiting were already crowded. The vehicles were limited, and those who arrived later were often disappointed, and some even could not buy a ticket for several days. Hiring someone to wait at the station the day before got a ticket. From Wenzhou, take a small steamer to Wenxi for about four hours, change to a wooden boat for about three hours, and stay overnight in Qingtian. The next morning, take a car for about three hours to Lishui, take the 1:00 PM express bus for about three and a half hours to Jinhua. You can either rest in Jinhua for a day or leave Jinhua on the 8:15 PM train that night. The inspection in Jinhua is also strict, and you may even be searched several times along the way. You may also be questioned in the inn. After the 8:15 train departs, it passes Yiyang in Jiangxi the next morning, and then passes Guixi Dongxiang around noon to Xiangtang near Nanchang, but does not pass Nanchang. If you want to go to Nanchang, change trains here. After leaving Xiangtang, it passes Fengcheng at 3:00 PM, Zhangshuzhen at about 4:00 PM, Qingjiang and Xinyu in the evening, and Fenyi and Yichun at night, and Pingxiang at 5:00 AM the next morning, and arrives at Zhuzhou at 7:30 AM. You could have gone from Zhuzhou via Hengyang to Guilin, but the bombing there was very severe, and the section of the highway from Guilin to Liuzhou was temporarily closed. Therefore, at about 6:00 PM that night, I took the Yuehan train to Changsha, crossed the river to a hotel near the Southwest Highway Bureau station and stayed overnight. The next morning, I took a car to Changde, arriving in Changde in about six and a half hours. Here, you can go north to Shashi or south to Yuanling, which is where I decided on the so-called third and fifth routes. If you go north to Shashi, the vehicles may or may not go, and it is very close to the war zone. Unless you hire a special car with many people, you may have to wait on the way.</p>
<p>Route South: The reporter decided to go south. The next morning, he left Changde by car and arrived in Yuanling after about seven hours and stayed overnight. There are two routes to take here, namely the so-called fourth and fifth routes. After repeated inquiries, I learned that the fourth route is shorter and saves money, but the highway is not good, the vehicles are mostly old and broken, and there are many bandits in the area. Although western Hunan is also a bandit area, there are more vehicles going back and forth, which seems safer. So I decided to take the fifth route. The next morning, I left Yuanling and arrived in western Hunan after about nine hours and stayed overnight. After resting in Huangxian for a day, I left at eight o'clock the next morning and arrived in Huangping at half past five in the afternoon and stayed overnight. I left again at seven o'clock the next morning, passed Huoding at twelve o'clock, and arrived in Guiyang at four o'clock in the afternoon. The next morning, I left Guiyang at seven o'clock and arrived in Zunyi after about seven hours and stayed overnight. The next morning, I left at eight o'clock, passed the rugged and steep Lou Mountain Pass at ten o'clock, arrived in Tongzi at eleven o'clock, passed Diaosi Rock at two o'clock, and arrived at Songkan on the border of Qianchuan in the afternoon to stay overnight. On the third morning, I left Songkan at eight o'clock, arrived in Dongxi at eleven o'clock, arrived in Qijiang at half past two in the afternoon, and arrived at Haitangxi on the south bank of Chongqing at half past seven in the evening.</p>
<p>The mountains are steep and dangerous: The train from Jinhua to Changsha is the safest route. The highway from Qingtian to Lishui is high on the mountainside, with high mountains on one side and deep streams on the other. On the way, I saw a car fall into the stream and drown many people. The section from Huangxian to Guiyang also has high mountains, dangerous roads, and many twists and turns, often two or three kilometers away, turning around a dozen or twenty times. Near Zhenyuan, the car travels in the sea of clouds, as if flying an airplane. The section from Zunyi to Songkan also climbs high mountains repeatedly, winding and twisting, up to more than a hundred times. The sky is slippery and dangerous. There are more accidents on the way. It is accidental after all, and travelers cannot stop because of this. Bandits are the most rampant along the entire route from Zhijiang to Huangping, which are the famous Xiangxi bandits. Now that the authorities of the two provinces are combining suppression and pacification, it seems that they have converged, but it is best for travelers to bring less money and luggage.</p>
<p>Registered ticket purchase: You must buy car awnings every morning before departure. Only Huangxian to Guiyang and Guiyang to Chongqing can buy joint tickets. In Zhejiang and Yuanling to Chongqing, excessive luggage can be purchased with luggage tickets, but Changsha and Changde limit each person to 20 kilograms. Passengers who exceed the limit will be refused to board. Passengers feel the most inconvenienced. The most difficult thing is that there are many people buying tickets and few cars. Some people wait in one place for up to two months without getting a ticket. In Zhejiang, tickets are purchased in order, and when the quota is full, it stops. After Changsha, you must register. At each station, there are hundreds of registrants, and up to thousands of registrants. At the Guiyang station, the registration has reached the end of July, and people in the hotel often take advantage of this to make profits, registering two or three people every day and selling the registered numbers one after another. Each number can be sold for one or two yuan or two or three yuan. This kind of improper profit-making method is the most common in Changde, and passengers are very distressed.</p>
<p>A glimpse of food and accommodation: Food and accommodation are the most inconvenient on the way. The food is inedible, and the sleep is restless. The locals in the interior have always been indifferent to cleanliness and hygiene. The food is rough and the price is expensive, especially in Yuanling and Guiyang. There are fleas, lice, and rats in one room, and in summer, there are bedbugs and mosquitoes. The suffering of traveling is no greater than this. Only the China Travel Service's reception center is the most comfortable, but unfortunately it has not been set up everywhere. Now, for the convenience of travelers, the reporter will record the hotels in various places later. Wenzhou, Garden Hotel on the side of the park, Qingtian, Yunjin Hotel in the city street, Lishui, Liancheng Hotel near the station, Jinhua, China Travel Service Reception Center near the train station, Changsha, Xianggan Hotel near the train station, Lishan Hotel next to the bus station, Changde, Dadao Hotel near the station, Yuanling, Zhuyuan Hotel specially contracted by China Travel Service, near the station, Huangxian, Yongxing Hotel next to the station, Huangping, a hotel specially contracted by China Travel Service, Guiyang, China Travel Service Guiyang Reception Center, Zunyi, Jiaotong Hotel near the station, Songkan, Southwest Hotel near the station.</p>
<p>Total travel expenses: The prices of the entire round of steamships, trains, and bus tickets are listed below: Shanghai to Wenzhou, official cabin 18 yuan, room cabin 12 yuan, general cabin 7 yuan, Wenzhou to Lishui combined bus ticket 3 yuan and 5 jiao, Lishui to Jinhua bus ticket 5 yuan, Jinhua to Zhuzhou train, second class 29 yuan and 2 jiao, sleeper 4 yuan, third class 14 yuan and 6 jiao, sleeper 3 yuan, Zhuzhou to Changsha, second class 1 yuan and 8 jiao, third class 9 jiao, Changsha to Changde, bus ticket 8 yuan and 1 jiao, Changde to Yuanling bus ticket 8 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen, Yuanling to Huangxian bus ticket 10 yuan and 05 jiao, Huangxian to Guiyang bus ticket 17 yuan, 1 jiao, and 5 fen, Guiyang to Chongqing bus ticket 21 yuan and 5 jiao. The number of kilometers traveled by car during the journey is listed below: Wenzhou to Jinhua 147 kilometers, Changsha to Changde 184 kilometers, Changde to Yuanling 197 kilometers, Yuanling to Huangxian 238 kilometers, Huangxian to Guiyang 398 kilometers, Guiyang to Chongqing 488 kilometers.</p>
<p>Precautions: A certificate with a photo of yourself must be carried for inspection, such as those issued by organizations or chambers of commerce and trade unions. A flashlight, wax candle, and galoshes must be carried, otherwise it is often difficult to walk, or there is no light at night, and it is even difficult to move an inch. Even in places with electric lights, they are often turned off completely at 11 o'clock. Food and blankets that can fill one or two days must be carried with you and cannot be made into luggage tickets. Often, the car breaks down in the deep mountains, and there is no fire or inn, so you must stay in the car to avoid freezing and starvation. The reporter stayed in the car for one night, and another person stayed in the car for three nights, both in uninhabited deep mountains or small stations without hotels and restaurants. When buying a ticket and getting on the bus, you must check that your luggage is in the same car, otherwise the person will arrive at a place and the luggage will not arrive, so you must wait, and some have to wait for three to five days and not get the luggage. The food you carry must be packed in a can, not in a paper bag or paper box, to avoid being gnawed by rats. Anyone who must stay in a large city for more than one day should first find a air-raid shelter or a safe area where they can take refuge in case of an air raid, so as to avoid temporary strongholds. The freight station at each station can also take passengers. If you have a little more luggage, you can negotiate with the stationmaster for a seat next to the driver of the freight car, which is best and safer than a passenger car that is not leaking. When getting on the bus, it is best to check the car's license plate number. In case of lost items, it is easier to investigate. If you ask relatives and friends to pick you up by telegram, it is also appropriate to specify the car number in the telegram.</p>
<h3>Western Newspaper Praises: Youth's Spirited Service on the Frontlines</h3>
<p>A correspondent for the Mainland News reported that after a recent tour of various frontlines in Central China, they received a letter yesterday (the 24th) stating that hundreds of war service stations organized by the National Government, staffed by thousands of young people from universities and middle schools across the country, are engaged in effective rescue work behind the lines in various parts of China. We visited nine service stations on a highway leading directly to the battlefield in northwestern Hunan. Each station was about eight miles apart, each staffed by five or six young people</p>
<p>volunteering their services. These young people on the road were all members of the Three People's Principles Youth Corps. Each station was equipped with medical supplies, books, magazines, and stoves for cooking porridge and boiling water. Above the entrance, the words "Service Station for Wounded Comrades" were written. To avoid air raids, we departed from our base late at night, carrying biscuits, soap, stationery, and other supplies for the stations, along with several boxes of gasoline and pastries and eggs for our own use. Along the way, we encountered small squads of soldiers and horses, as well as military trucks carrying supplies for the wounded. Shortly after midnight, we arrived at a small town to spend the night. A lantern was still lit in front of the service station in this town. The station occupied two rooms facing the road with the door wide open. We entered and woke up a boy who led us to a farmhouse outside the road, where the young people serving at the station were also staying, about a quarter of a mile from the road. That night, we stayed at a farmhouse. The next morning, we got up at six o'clock, took a breath of fresh air in the fields, and followed the winding paths between the rice paddies to the service station. When we arrived, they had already cooked a pot of porridge and a pot of water. Two square tables were set up with bowls and chopsticks, surrounded by long benches. Several soldiers were eating sesame flatbreads and fried dough sticks for breakfast. The porridge was for the wounded soldiers. As guests, we also got to taste the hot porridge. After introductions, we met the five staff members of the station, all middle school-aged</p>
<p>handsome young men, wearing badges with their names and numbers on them. When we addressed them and distributed the goods, they all stood respectfully. The five young men came from different places. One was eighteen years old, from Guilin. He had not informed his parents, only left a note and a hundred yuan, and secretly left with the war relief service group. We urged him to write a letter home so that his parents would know where their son was. Although the living conditions of the young people were simple, they were all very excited. Their uniforms were stained with mud, and some wore straw sandals like soldiers, but they all had clean faces and bright eyes. They told us that countless young men and women were voluntarily serving the war effort in various parts of the country. We then set off early to visit service stations closer to the front lines. At this time, soldiers and horses were gathered on the road. Two sure signs that we had reached the front lines were the strong smell of stables and the large number of dry and wet military uniforms exposed to the sun. At noon, we arrived at a village where the headquarters of the frontline army was located. One of our party was quite familiar with the commander, so we went to visit him. He was about to leave for an inspection, so he accompanied us. We drove for several miles and then walked along a mountain path to reach the frontline observation post. In front of us was the no man's land of the battlefield. Looking through a high-powered telescope, we could see the Japanese barracks, and the explosions of artillery fire from our side among the Japanese. The valley echoed repeatedly with the sound of shelling. At the same time, Japanese planes were flying overhead, strafing us with machine guns. After returning from the front lines, we visited three other service stations that day. At one place, we were stopped by soldiers shouting. After they checked our passes, they bowed and let us pass. These soldiers were extremely polite, greatly reflecting their good discipline. Roads leading to various major battlefields are lined with similar service stations, all led by Colonel Huang, head of the war zone service corps. Mr. Huang graduated from a university abroad and served as a secretary of the YMCA. He also serves as the secretary-general of the New Life Movement Federation, etc.</p>
<h3>Leqing's Qitou Ocean: Japanese Warships Burn Boats and Plunder Cargo</h3>
<p>A dispatch from Wenling: Since the start of the War of Resistance against Japan in the spring of last year, Japanese warships have been stationed or patrolling the seas off the coast of eastern Zhejiang, including the counties of Yuhuan, Leqing, and Yongjia. They occasionally fire on the shore, and merchant ships and fishing boats cannot freely navigate the seas. Since the fall of Guangzhou, the Japanese warships stationed at sea have sailed south one after another. Unexpectedly, recently, several Japanese warships have returned, patrolling the waters off the coast of the Yule counties outside the mouth of the Wenzhou River, and are exclusively engaged in looting merchant ships. According to Lao Da (captain) Ziyao, of a merchant ship that escaped from the sea, three or four Japanese warships are currently stationed in the waters of Qitou Ocean in Leqing County and Dimen Mountain at the junction of Yule, and are patrolling the waters off Huangda'ao, Hengzhi, and outside Kengmen in Yuhuan County from time to time. In the past week, about seven or eight merchant ships have been burned. At that time, three merchant ships sailing with me (Ziyao) were carrying sixty or seventy boxes of mandarin oranges, seventy or eighty pieces of straw mats, and tobacco leaves to Yongjia. The ships passed through Qitou Ocean and were spotted by Japanese warships. They launched speedboats, intercepted and robbed the cargo, and kidnapped young passengers and merchants. Their fate is unknown. The elderly were imprisoned in the ship's cabin, and then the ships were burned. This kind of inhuman act is extremely heartbreaking.</p>
<h3>Jiashan Chinese Troops Approach Suburbs</h3>
<p>Correspondence from Jiashan: Since Jiashan fell, the Chinese troops have recovered the nearby towns and villages one after another within the past year, and established a county government in a certain place. In the past half month, the Chinese troops have been active in the suburbs in conjunction with the local people. The Japanese troops have added fortifications near the four gates, and forcibly demolished houses near the East Gate, claiming that they obstruct the line of sight. A few days ago, a unit of the Chinese troops advanced along the waterway and reached the outskirts of the city. At that time, four officials of the puppet government were passing by and were arrested by the Chinese soldiers and taken to the base area for interrogation. A notice from Commander Gu Zong and Zhu Tong was posted in the suburbs, stating that "The people have been under the oppression of the Japanese and puppet regime for a long time and have suffered greatly. This commander and others have long heard of it. In addition to ordering the various troops to continue to carry out mobile warfare in order to annihilate the enemy and avoid future troubles, we also hope that the local people will remain calm and patient in the short term to await the final victory," etc. It is said that after the Japanese and puppet regime discovered the notice, they conducted a thorough and strict search of the nearby people, but none of them uttered a word. Since this incident, the Japanese and puppet regimes have not dared to leave the city lightly, and have advanced the closing time of the city gates.</p>

<h3>Content of Reply to Japanese Side: Concession to Announce Today. US Consulate in Close Communication with Washington. Closures Continue in Alleys with Stricter Inspection of Pedestrians</h3>
<p>The Japanese side, citing the continuous occurrence of "terrorist incidents" in the concession and blaming the authorities for insufficient police force, has lodged two protests with the Municipal Council. It is now learned that the Municipal Council's reply to the Japanese side was sent out at 6 pm on Saturday, delivered by the Chairman of the Council, Mr. Fessenden, to the Japanese Consul-General, Mr. Miura. The wording of the reply will be released in full this afternoon (the 27th). It is reported that this reply had been reviewed and approved by the British and American authorities and the Consular Corps beforehand, and the wording was very cautious, indicating that the Municipal Council is now doing its best to take all effective measures to maintain law and order in police work, in order to reduce the occurrence of similar incidents.</p>
<p>US Consul's Tough Stance Towards Japan</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, regarding the Japanese demands, it is said that the US Consulate is taking a particularly tough stance towards Japan. The details of this incident have not been announced by the relevant parties, but the US Consul-General Gauss and many of his staff are still working late at the consulate, communicating frequently with Washington, as was the case during the "January 28th" and "August 13th" Shanghai War incidents.</p>
<p>Alleys Continue to be Sealed Off</p>
<p>In order to maintain security within the concession, the Public Concession suddenly sealed off the alleys on both the north and south sides of Nanjing Road the day before yesterday. Yesterday, it continued to seal off Fuzhou Road (also known as Fourth Road) and the area of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch (commonly known as Changbang Road) at the junction of the British and French concessions. All alleys with exits have been made one-way traffic after one end has been set up with barbed wire. The narrow alleys are only for residents and are not important. Among them, a few alleys have commercial markets, but now they are sealed off, and all customers have to make detours. For example, the Xinhui Le Li and Sanyuanfang on Fuzhou Road leading to Yu Qiaqing Road, which are known for their flower industry, were sealed off yesterday. Xinhui Le Li has to enter and exit from Guangxi Road, and Sanyuanfang has to enter and exit from Shantou Road. Tongwuma Road and Pingdeng Street were also sealed off yesterday. Yesterday, the alleys on Fuzhou Road that had barbed wire set up included Delin Li, Sanyuanfang, Xinhui Le Li, Daxing Li, Fuxiang Li, Tongxing Li, Hele Li, Ping'an Li, Jiu'an Li, Fuxing Li, Yongshun Li, etc. The alleys that were originally one-way and did not have rear alleys that were not sealed off included Chongrang Li, Shijie Li, Donggonghe Li, Xigonghe Li, and Juxing Li. Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch, which are several miles long, have many alleys that have been sealed off, but only on the side near the Public Concession up to the Haig Road intersection. The side near the French Concession has not been blocked off.</p>
<p>Police Ordered to Inspect Pedestrians</p>
<p>Starting at 8 am yesterday, the Municipal Council ordered its various police stations, such as the Central Police Station, Laozha Police Station, Xinzha Police Station, Chengdu Road Police Station, Gordon Road Police Station, Putuo Road Police Station, and Jing'an Temple Police Station, to dispatch all Chinese and Western detectives on duty, wearing iron wire vests and carrying pistols and submachine guns, to patrol the roads, and to inspect all public buses, trams, and other suspicious-looking taxis, rickshaws, pedestrians, etc. It is also reported that the Huisi Police Station in the Northern District (i.e., Haining Road Police Station), Dixiwei Road Police Station, Huishan Police Station (i.e., Hongkou Police Station), Jiaxing Road Police Station, Yulin Road Police Station, Tilanqiao Police Station, and Yangshupu Police Station, as well as the Central Police Station of the French Concession (Avenue Joffre), Xujiahui Police Station, Avenue Foch Police Station, Avenue Petain Police Station, Avenue Joffre Police Station, and Laobeimen Police Station, etc., also had similar deployments.</p>
<h3>Chinese Guerilla Unit Parades Armed in Pudong. Unarmed Puppet Police Turn a Blind Eye. Japanese Troops in Gaohashi Dare Not Interfere</h3>
<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily, it is said that recently, the armed patrols by the puppet police of the "Shanghai Municipal Government" have been disarmed by the guerilla units in the suburbs, who then use the slogan "Chinese Don't Fight Chinese" to let them go. However, the Japanese side believes that the puppet police are suspected of sending weapons to the guerillas, and has confiscated all the weapons of the "police" in Pudong. Until about 4 pm yesterday (the 25th), a group of about seventy or eighty guerillas suddenly appeared, carrying pistols, hand grenades, light machine guns, etc., and paraded on Peidong Avenue, shouting the slogan "Down with Japanese Imperialism". At that time, the puppet police had no weapons, so they turned a blind eye. What is strange is that a large team of Japanese soldiers was stationed in the Gaohashi area, and there were also several Japanese warships on the river, but they did not dare to move at all, allowing the guerilla unit to parade away. However, the Japanese are so lenient towards the guerillas in their defense zone, but they make many accusations regarding the terrorist incidents in the concession.</p>
<h3>Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire Temporarily Suspend Loading. Cargo Piles Up at Haiphong. Huge Numbers of Vehicles Stranded in Vietnam. The Two Companies Plan to Build New Docks</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou and Wuhan, China's maritime transportation line has shifted from Guangdong and Hong Kong to Yunnan and Burma, and all export goods from the Guangdong-Yunnan-Vietnam line are transported to Guangdong and Yunnan, and then exported through the overseas routes of Burma and Vietnam. The goods ordered from Europe and the United States are also transported into the interior through these two main lines. Therefore, Rangoon, Haiphong, and Kunming have replaced Guangzhou and Hong Kong in function. The British shipping companies Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire have opened direct shipping lines from Shanghai to Haiphong to facilitate passenger and cargo transportation. The cargo warehouses and lighter warehouses in Haiphong have been filled with goods, and a large number of vehicles are stranded in Vietnam. Therefore, the Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire ships sailing between Shanghai and Haiphong have temporarily suspended loading cargo. They will resume after the cargo piled up in Haiphong is cleared. It is also heard that Jardine Matheson and Butterfield &amp; Swire are preparing to build new cargo docks in Haiphong.</p>
<h3>Temporary Measures for Opium Quit Certificates in Extraordinary Times. Issuance of Poverty Licenses, Travel Permits, etc. Free of Charge to Avoid Difficulties</h3>
<p>The Opium Prohibition Committee has drafted temporary measures for the use of opium quit certificates in extraordinary times, and submitted them to the Ministry of Interior for approval and then to the Executive Yuan for record. The measures are recorded as follows: Article 1: In extraordinary times, in order to avoid difficulties in provinces and cities receiving and transporting opium quit certificates, these measures are specially formulated. Article 2: The opium quit certificates and opium addict purchase count tables that provinces and cities should receive from the Opium Prohibition Committee of the Ministry of Interior according to regulations shall be temporarily made and issued locally by the provincial and municipal governments according to the fixed format. Article 3: The "Opium Quit Certificates" temporarily made by the provincial and municipal governments shall be valid only after being affixed with special stamps made by the Opium Prohibition Committee of the Ministry of Interior. However, the opium addict purchase count table shall not be affixed with stamps. Article 4: All free poverty licenses and travel permits that are not charged shall be affixed with stamps, and the Opium Prohibition Committee of the Ministry of Interior shall issue and affix them free of charge. Article 5: The special stamps for opium quit certificates are divided into the following four types: 1. Red: for ordinary opium quit licenses; 2. Blue: for opium quit licenses for the poor; 3. Green: for opium quit licenses for the indigent; 4. Ochre: for opium addict travel permits. Article 6: The provincial and municipal governments shall temporarily make the opium quit certificates and retain half of the one-fifth certificate fee originally paid to the Opium Prohibition Committee of the Ministry of Interior as the cost of printing the certificates, which shall still be included in the opium prohibition budget for unified collection and expenditure. The remaining half shall be paid to the Opium Prohibition Committee of the Ministry of Interior as the cost of the stamps. Article 7: The stamps affixed to the opium quit certificates shall be stamped with a cancellation mark of a different color at the adhesive opening. Article 8: If the opium quit certificate stamps are forged or peeled off and re-glued, they shall be punished according to law.

Article 10: These measures shall be implemented from the date of approval.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Salt Smuggling Completed. Totaling 3.82 Million Dan. National Treasury Revenue Increased by More Than 30 Million</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the salt produced in eastern Zhejiang from being used by the enemy and to alleviate the salt shortage panic in Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan, our military authorities changed the wartime food salt transportation office in Zhejiang Province to the wartime food salt collection and transportation office in Zhejiang District in July last year, and the Ministry of Finance sent personnel to jointly operate with Zhejiang Province to actively smuggle Zhejiang salt. As of last month, the main salt production and stored salt in Zhejiang Province have been completely transported, totaling 3.82 million dan. It is said that in addition to the central assistance funds that Zhejiang Province should receive, the foreign sales surcharges and provincial treasury have collected more than 1.1 million yuan. After the salt is released from the field, the Ministry of Finance can collect an average of 10 yuan in salt tax per dan, and the national treasury has increased its salt tax revenue by 38.2 million yuan. It is also said that there is usually no such sales volume for this salt, and there is no salt tax revenue. At the same time, it is difficult for salt farmers to obtain this huge amount of money. If it is used by the enemy, the government and the salt farmers will suffer great losses. Therefore, the smuggling of salt in eastern Zhejiang this time was able to be transported out in the shortest possible time. Whether it is the government or the salt farmers, the receipt of this huge amount of money is indeed a major harvest in the midst of the War of Resistance.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Navigation Administration Office Newly Revised: Measures for Issuing Licenses to Steamships. Implemented from March 1st, Ordered All Ships to Comply. Moufu, De Ping and Other Ships Have Been Surveyed</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Navigation Administration Office, directly under the Ministry of Communications, has recently revised the measures for issuing import and export permits and inner harbor visa slips for steamships, which will be implemented from March 1st. The Ningbo Shipping Association has been ordered to inform the shipping companies to comply. Moufu, Deping, and other ships have been surveyed by the Navigation Administration Bureau and are allowed to sail directly between Shanghai and Ningbo on a regular basis. The remaining ships are still temporarily operating. There were no Japanese reconnaissance aircraft in Ningbo the day before yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Navigation Office Notifies Shipping Companies</p>
<p>The Ningbo Navigation Administration Office, directly under the Ministry of Communications, has issued Notice No. 102 to the Ningbo Shipping Association, ordering all shipping companies to comply with the three measures for issuing import and export permits and two-port visa slips for ships. The original text states: "This office will issue import and export permits and inner harbor visa slips for steamships starting from March 1st. In addition to notifying separately, we are sending you a copy of the temporary measures for issuing permits and visa slips, and asking you to comply."</p>
<p>Measures for Issuing Import and Export Permits</p>
<p>Temporary Measures for Issuing Import and Export Permits and Inner Harbor Visa Slips for Steamships Entering and Exiting the Ningbo Jiang Estuary by the Ningbo Navigation Administration Office, directly under the Ministry of Communications. These measures are drafted in accordance with Article 2 of the Measures for Restricting Navigation in Coastal Ports promulgated by the Military Commission under the Ministry of Communications. Steamships operating regularly between Ningbo and inner ports (such as Dinghai and Shipu) (such as Tianbao and Libao) must present the inner harbor visa slip issued by this office to the Zhejiang Customs for inspection and clearance when entering and exiting. (The visa slip shall be kept by the ships themselves after presentation). Steamships operating between Ningbo and commercial ports or important ports (such as Hong Kong, Shanghai, Wenzhou, and Haimen) shall be handled in accordance with the following regulations: Steamships entering the port, starting from March 1st of the 28th year, shall apply to this office in advance for the issuance of an import permit when entering the port for the first time, and then submit it to the Ningbo Garrison Command to order the Zhenhai police teams to check and release it. For each subsequent entry, an import permit issued by this office must be obtained in advance and stored on the ship, and only after it has been checked and collected by the Zhenhai police teams will it be allowed to sail. In special circumstances where steamships cannot complete the procedures in time to enter the port, they may consult with the Ningbo Garrison Command to determine how to handle them. Steamships exiting the port, starting from March 1st of the 28th year, must first purchase an export permit issued by this office each time they exit the port, present it to the Zhejiang Customs for inspection and clearance, and then present it to the Ningbo Martial Law Inspection Office for inspection, collection, and release. Note: All procedures for applying for import and export permits and inner harbor visa slips for steamships can be handled with this office.</p>
<p>Moufu and Other Ships Have Been Surveyed</p>
<p>Since the Headquarters of the × Army Group issued the revised measures for navigation in eastern Zhejiang to adjust navigation in eastern Zhejiang, it has been stipulated that the ships operating on each line must apply to the Ningbo and Wenzhou Navigation Administration Offices for measurement, inspection, and issuance of certificates before they are allowed to operate. Before these procedures are completed, all ships that have been approved for registration may temporarily maintain their original status. It is now learned that Moufu, Deping, Tangsai, and Meida, which operate on the Shanghai-Ningbo line, have been measured and considered qualified by the Navigation Administration Office. Those operating on the Wenzhou line, such as Tanglu, Tangbei, Meifa, and Baolili, have also been measured. As for the others that have not been inspected and operate on the Shanghai-rain line, they are still temporary in nature.</p>
<p>No Japanese Aircraft in Eastern Zhejiang the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>It was also reported yesterday that Japanese aircraft flew to Ningbo, Zhuji, and Jinhua the day before yesterday for reconnaissance. The reporter of the Modern News inquired about it with the crew of the Moufu ship, which had just arrived in Shanghai from Ningbo yesterday morning (according to them, the ship left Ningbo at about 4 pm the day before yesterday). According to them, five Japanese aircraft dropped bombs in Zhenhai and Linhai on the 22nd, but Ningbo did not see any Japanese aircraft on the 26th (i.e., the day before yesterday). Therefore, what was reported in the Shanghai newspaper may be misinformation. The situation at the estuary has gradually recovered, and foreign ships are planning to resume navigation to maintain their business.</p>
<h3>Interpretation of Partnership Trademark Registration: Even if the Partner Serving as Manager Withdraws from the Partnership, It Does Not Affect the Exclusive Right to Use the Trademark</h3>
<p>The Executive Yuan previously submitted a report from the Ministry of Industry stating that a partnership firm uses a trademark registered in the name of the partner serving as manager. If the partner withdraws from the partnership, whether the trademark should be transferred for registration is a matter of doubt. After consulting the Judicial Yuan for interpretation, the Ministry of Economic Affairs was instructed to take note. The Executive Yuan's order to the Ministry of Economic Affairs is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry's letter No. 53835 from March 25th of the 26th year, requesting a consultation on the interpretation of the provisions of the Trademark Law, has been consulted by the Judicial Yuan for interpretation and instructed to file for record. Now, the Judicial Yuan's letter No. 1836 from January 19th of the 28th year states: "It has been decided by the Unified Interpretation of Laws Conference of this Yuan that if a trademark used by a partnership firm was originally applied for registration by the partner serving as manager in the name of the manager, if the partner withdraws from the partnership, transfers shares to others, and another partner serves as manager, it is different from transferring the business. Since it does not affect the exclusive right to use the trademark, it does not apply to the provisions of the Trademark Law regarding transfer of registration. A corresponding reply is sent for your reference and instruction." In view of this, the Ministry of Economic Affairs is hereby ordered to take note. This order.</p>

<h3>Power Company Raises Prices Again. Citizens' Association Requests Negotiations for Cancellation. Repeated Price Increases Are Not Affordable for Citizens and Contradict the Purpose of Public Utilities</h3>
<p>The 35th District Branch of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation has written to the City Federation regarding the increase in electricity prices by the power company, stating: "We are writing to inform you that we have read in the newspaper that the power company has announced that it will increase electricity prices again starting from March 1st, and the Municipal Council's Finance Committee has agreed. It will increase the price by 10% again as before. The Public Concession Power Company once used the excuse of inconsistent company revenue and expenditure to intend to increase electricity prices by 32.5% before the war. Later, the City Federation, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, and the City Chamber of Commerce, etc., insisted on opposing it because the citizens could not afford it. The Concession authorities also feared that it would provoke incidents and temporarily suspended the company's request to increase electricity prices. When the Shanghai War broke out, the company took the opportunity to request an increase in prices, and the Municipal Council approved it, increasing it by 22.5%. The remaining 10% would be reviewed and seized again after six months. Now that the deadline has expired, the company has requested that the unadded % be added again, and the Municipal Council has again expressed its agreement to uniformly increase it starting from March 1st, for a total of 32.5%. In fact, only daily necessities stores have been slightly prosperous after the war, and it is undeniable that citizens are experiencing economic difficulties due to the high cost of living. This time, the power company is disregarding the difficulties of the times and raising prices again, which is not affordable for citizens in extraordinary times and is contrary to the purpose of public utilities to facilitate the public. Therefore, we are writing to request that the City Federation, the Taxpayers' Association, and the City Chamber of Commerce work together to strive for negotiations to cancel the price increase, so as to lighten the burden on citizens and maintain the market. We are eagerly looking forward to it."</p>
<h3>The 50th Scout Troop Service Report: 630,000 Kilometers Traveled, Escorting Over 70,000 Soldiers and Civilians</h3>
<p>After the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, some members of the 50th Scout Troop of this city immediately served in the Red Cross, transporting and providing first aid. After the National Army moved west, they followed to the interior to continue their service. By the end of last year, they had been working for sixteen months. Now, as the Red Cross is holding an executive and supervisory committee meeting in Hong Kong, the troop has submitted a work report for the Red Cross to review. Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>Work Situation: The first phase of service was in Shanghai, from August 13, 1937, to November 8, 1937, a total of three months. Starting from September 25th, they were responsible for the wounded soldier distribution station at the Foreign Affairs Building. On October 28th, when the National Army was moving to new positions, roads and bridges were bombed and severely damaged, making rescue work impossible. The troop then organized a "Pathfinding First Aid Team" to venture out and rescue wounded soldiers. The service involved a total of 60 people, covering more than ten counties in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, such as Wusong, Baoshan, the city center, North Sichuan Road, Qiujiang Wharf, Jiangwan, Dachang, Miaohang, Gujiazhai, Luodian, Liuhang, Liuhe, Yanghang, Yuepu, Zhenru, Luoyang Bridge, Nanxiang, Jiading, Xinzhuang, Qibao, Qingpu, Taicang, Kunshan, Changshu, Suzhou, Wuxi, Nanjing, Songjiang, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, and other places, with 1,871 deployments, covering 93,556 kilometers, and rescuing 62,007 wounded soldiers and refugees. The second phase was in the interior, from November 9, 1937, to the end of 1938, a total of twelve months. Their work included: moving west with the army from Shanghai, via Suzhou to Nanjing, then from Nanjing to Changsha, reaching Hankou, moving medical supplies and staff, and simultaneously transporting wounded soldiers from Shanghai to eastern Zhejiang; from Hankou to Changsha, they began long-distance journeys to the north, south, east, and west, dispatching personnel, transporting wounded soldiers, and transporting medical materials and supplies; they were responsible for front-line rescue work and transporting wounded soldiers on the Nanxun Line; after the Changsha fire, they moved to Qiyang to prepare for later services. The staff consisted of 40 people, covering thirteen provinces, including Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hunan, Guangxi, Guangdong, Guizhou, and Yunnan, more than eighty counties, and more than one hundred locations, covering 476,401 kilometers, with 1,081 deployments, transporting 14,144 pieces of medicine, and rescuing and transporting 11,756 wounded soldiers, villagers, and service personnel. In the above two phases, the total distance traveled was 569,957 kilometers, transporting 14,144 items, and rescuing 73,763 soldiers and civilians.</p>
<p>Martyred Members: A total of three members of the troop were martyred while participating in the service: He Guoshou, 22 years old, an employee of the Hesheng Foreign Firm in Shanghai, reported to the troop for service at 1:00 PM on August 22, 1937, and was killed by a bomb near the Sincere Company. He had an elderly mother at home and was unmarried. Du Xiangxian, 25 years old, an employee of the Ellis Foreign Firm in Shanghai, overworked in Shanghai, became ill due to overwork, and developed typhoid fever. He died at the Baolong Hospital on October 31, 1937. He had an elderly mother at home, one older brother, two younger sisters, and was unmarried. Cang Chengquan, 22 years old, an employee of the Chunsheng Sports Equipment Company in Shanghai, contracted malaria while traveling on official business in Guiyang and died at the Guiyang Central Hospital on December 31, 1938. He had an elderly father at home, one older brother, and was unmarried. In addition, eighteen members of the troop were injured.</p>
<h3>Invitation Card Exhibition: Rules for Submission Established</h3>
<p>The fundraising exhibition of ancient and modern invitation cards to aid the needy, initiated by prominent figures in this city such as Lin Kanghou, Xu Jiyin, and Zhou Bangjun, has been reported in various newspapers. It is now learned that the association has recently received support from famous figures in Shanghai, such as Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Chu Minyi, Xu Xiaochu, Fang Jiaobo, and Ge Fuchu, making progress even smoother. The association has now established the following rules for open submission: The submission should focus on invitation cards for social gatherings, weddings, funerals, and celebrations. Similar invitation cards may also be included. The selection of invitation cards for the exhibition will be based on four criteria: A. Perfect wording; B. Relevant historical documents; C. Novel style; D. Excellent printing. Ordinary submissions will be kept and the name of the donor will be acknowledged, but they will not be returned. If there are fine pieces or if they need to be returned, the association can be notified in advance and a receipt will be issued. After the exhibition, the original items will be returned. For precious submissions or a large number of items, a letter can be sent to notify the association, and an appropriate person will be sent to collect them in person. Those who wish to submit are requested to send them directly to the preparatory office of the association at Yichang Money Exchange in Xingren Lane, Ningbo Road, in the Public Concession, and to various collection points. Once a sufficient number of items has been collected, a location will be selected and the exhibition will be open to the public. All proceeds from ticket sales will be used to aid those in need. If all sectors can enthusiastically support and submit items as soon as possible, the exhibition can be held sooner, and those in need can benefit earlier. In the future, when the meeting is held, there will be a special publication of the invitation card exhibition, containing texts and pictures of invitation card research, which will be a new approach and will make great contributions to social etiquette and Chinese literature.</p>
<h3>Ning Shi Creditors' Group: Creditors' Meeting Held; Those Who Have Not Participated Can Still Register</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Ningbo Industrial Bank creditors' group held its first creditors' meeting yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Siming Building. More than 100 people attended, including Wang Changsheng. Five resolutions were passed, and Zou Chunrong, Wang Changsheng, Ge Hecai, Wu Guozhu, and nine others were elected as creditors' representatives to be responsible for presiding over the meeting. It is also reported that those who have not yet participated can still register with the group.</p>
<h3>Money Shops Begin Sending Account Books and Making Loans, Adopting a Guarantee System; Domestic Goods Factories and Businesses Given Priority; Loans Issued Last Year Have All Been Recovered</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association's 41 member shops opened on the 23rd of this month. The association held an executive committee meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday to report on the opening situation of each shop, and to pass resolutions on reorganizing the member money shops and replacing representatives. The annual meeting of the Beishi Guild Hall will be held on March 9th. According to the New Voice News reporter's inquiries, money shops have always emphasized credit when making loans. However, due to the abnormal development of various industries in the Shanghai concession area, all the loans issued last year have been recovered. In order to support the development of domestic goods businesses and factories, the account books of domestic goods factories and businesses will be sent out starting today. However, the post-war method will still be followed, and a guarantee system will be adopted for all loans, and the amount of overdrafts will be appropriately limited.</p>

<h3>Foreigners Evacuated from Guling Expected to Arrive in Shanghai Tonight; 55 Still Remaining on the Mountain; Japanese Side Notified of Concentrated Locations</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that, according to Japanese sources in this city last night (the 25th), a Japanese transport ship carrying 47 foreigners from Guling has sailed from Jiujiang and is expected to arrive in Shanghai tomorrow morning (the 27th). The Japanese side has received direct telegraph reports from the ship regarding its progress. Unless there are unexpected delays, it is expected to dock not far from Wusong tomorrow evening (i.e., tonight). It is reported that the ship left Jiujiang early Thursday morning and docked in Nanjing that day. Reliable sources here learned last night that 55 foreigners are still remaining on Guling, determined not to leave the mountain under any circumstances. For protection, they have concentrated in two locations. It is reported that the Japanese authorities have been notified of the precise locations of these two sites. Among the 55 foreigners remaining on the mountain, eight are disabled and unable to move, and eighteen are elderly, over seventy years old. Of these 55 people, 12 are American citizens and seven are Swedish citizens. They have left their residences and concentrated at the American Boys' School, but the school is in a dangerous location, as it is less than 100 yards from the Chinese government building. The 37 British citizens remaining on Guling have left their residences and concentrated in a hotel about one and a half li from the American Boys' School. The third concentration camp in Jiujiang is located in the Chinese refugee shelter in the Methodist Church Village. It is reported that there are hundreds of poor Chinese refugees inside. The establishment of this shelter has also been notified to the Japanese side. All three concentration camps have large white signs and foreign flags, which are said to be clearly visible from the air. The person in charge of the refugee shelter is Dr. Liepeh, who says he will do his best to serve the welfare of those under his care. There are no major problems with the supply of goods to Guling for the time being. There are currently sufficient rice and canned goods to last for half a year, but the supply of meat, vegetables, and eggs is dwindling. It is noted that the previous report that there were only 65 foreigners in Guling was inaccurate. There are 55 people remaining on the mountain, and 47 have been evacuated, bringing the total to 102.</p>
<h3>Sand and Gravel Association Holds Executive and Supervisory Meeting; Firmly Opposes Any Form of Monopoly; Public Associations Unanimously Express Support</h3>
<p>After the Sand and Gravel Association opposed Wan Tai's monopolistic operations, the association held a temporary joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at the association's headquarters at 2:00 PM yesterday. More than 20 people attended, including Lu Xiaozuo and Li Zefu. Lu Xiaozuo was elected as temporary chairman. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, and then the following resolutions were discussed: Resolutely oppose any form of monopolistic behavior; resolution passed. A case involving non-members Zhou and Wang colluding with Wan Tai Company to organize the Sijiao Yellow Sand Joint Transport Company, attempting to undermine the operations of all fellow traders: resolution passed, notify fellow traders to unanimously stop barging and refuse to trade. A case involving workers Fang Jinxiang and others being forced to be convicted, requesting assistance from the association: resolution passed, assistance approved. The association received a letter from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in reply, stating: In response to your letter regarding the Wan Tai Company, we are aware of the matter. If your association has any feasible measures, this association will provide assistance to the extent possible. The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession replied, stating: In response to your letter, we have received your request for assistance regarding the monopoly and control of the Wan Tai Sand and Gravel Company. We will do our best within the scope of our capabilities.</p>
<h3>Japanese Increase Troops on the Coast of Northern Jiangsu; War Imminent; Songji Port and Other Ports Sealed Off by Chinese Army; Tense Situation Along the Coast, Sluggish Business for All Ships</h3>
<p>Since elite troops of the Chinese army were successively transferred to Tongzhou, Rugao, Chongming, Qidong, and Haimen counties in northern Jiangsu to deploy along the coast, the Japanese side has been greatly alarmed. In recent days, they have dispatched more than 600 Japanese troops to the Qinglonggang and Futong Tianshenggang areas, and have built fortifications, creating a very tense situation. War is imminent, and business along the river has also suddenly become sluggish. The following is a report from a Modern News reporter on various situations:</p>
<p>Strong Chinese Military Strength</p>
<p>The guerrilla units of the five counties of Nantong, Rugao, Chongming, Qidong, and Haimen, since being actively reorganized and trained by the 24th Group Army of the Second War Zone, have become a strong force, estimated to total between 70,000 and 90,000 people. They are distributed in various port areas and important strongholds in the inland areas of each county. The troops along the coast are the most elite, with several field guns and small steel cannons in each regiment, making them a very strong force. Commander-in-chief Li Mingyang went to a certain location last week to convene the generals of each county and instruct them on future policies. All the strong men trained in the previous counties have enlisted one after another and been transferred to a certain location to undergo various academic training. Prepare the reserve team,</p>
<p>Japanese Reinforcements and Deployment</p>
<p>According to a person who came from Tongzhou to the Modern News reporter last night, since the Chinese army transferred troops to the coast of each county, the Japanese troops originally stationed in Tianshenggang, Dashenggang, and Haimen Qinglonggang in Tongzhou were greatly alarmed. The number of naval marines sent from Shanghai to various ports for deployment was about 600. Two Japanese ships and forty or fifty speedboats are docked outside the port of Tianshenggang. A small gunboat is docked at Qinglonggang. Observing the reinforcements, they appear listless and not in good spirits, with few strong men, as if they had been recently transferred back from the front lines for recuperation. Japanese amphibious aircraft fly in groups of three or five over the coastal sky every day, conducting reconnaissance.</p>
<p>Various Shallow Ports Have Been Blockaded</p>
<p>The ports in the northern Jiangsu area, from Haimen to Rugao, include Songji Port, Niuhong Port, Jianji Port, Hetong Port, Qinglonggang, Xin Port, Lingdian Port, Sanhe Port, Dong No. 1 to No. 3 Ports. Further south are Nantong's Dashenggang, Tianshenggang, Xin Port, and the various ports of Chongming Island. Among them, the beaches of Songji Port and Xin Port are closer to the navigable waterways, making it easier for Japanese speedboats to land. Moreover, Japanese troops have repeatedly landed in the past, always coming through these two ports. Therefore, the Chinese army, fearing that the Japanese side would follow the old route to land again, specifically implemented a blockade of each port a few days ago to block the path. In recent days, the situation along the coast has been very tense, and there is a sense of impending war. Residents are moving away one after another, and the freight volume of ships traveling the Beisha Line has been sluggish, so the number of trips has been reduced to observe the development of the situation.</p>
<h3>Current Situation in Tianjin Under Japanese Violence</h3>
<p>According to a merchant who just came to Shanghai from Tianjin yesterday, since the July 7th Lugouqiao Incident, the Japanese side has been acting recklessly in the North China area, not only arbitrarily oppressing the Chinese people, but also being extremely hostile to foreigners residing in Tianjin and Pingjin. Especially to the British and French expatriates, they are also severely oppressed. All foreign commercial ships entering and leaving must first dock at the Japanese concession wharf, undergo various inspections, and then be allowed to sail into the concession wharves of the respective countries to load and unload cargo and passengers. The areas with heavy traffic between the various national concessions and the Chinese area in Tianjin used to have an international iron bridge built to facilitate communication. However, the Japanese side seized the rights and interests of foreigners and, in order to indirectly blockade the transportation between the Chinese and foreign concessions, specifically built an iron bridge behind the Zhongyuan Company last autumn, which is expected to be completed next month. In the future, after the completion of the bridge, the concessions of various countries in Tianjin will be equivalent to dead places. According to the merchant, although the people in North China are living under the tyranny of the Japanese, just like slaves, they have a deep sense of national identity and their patriotic sentiments are very high. The only pity is that the class system of the people in the north has not yet been eliminated. However, young students and workers, leaving their homes or abandoning their wives and children, are flocking south to participate in the war of resistance, which is very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>Yao Cotton Transported to Shanghai; Totaling More Than 88,000 Packages</h3>
<p>Since permission was granted by the Zhejiang authorities to export Yao cotton, the number of packages that have arrived in Shanghai successively loaded on Mahler and other ships is 16,000. This Yao cotton is handled by the British-owned United Cotton Mill and Chongxin Cotton Mill. In addition to what has already arrived in Shanghai, there are still 62,216 packages of Yao cotton (16 kilograms per package) that can be loaded in Shanghai within days.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on German Jewish Refugees Coming to Shanghai; Passports Not Approved by the Chinese Side Will Not Be Allowed to Depart for Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Continental News reports that rumors are circulating that 12,000 German Jews will arrive in Shanghai before September. Yesterday (the 25th), according to well-informed sources in this city who have close contact with the German Jewish situation, the number will not be so large, but there is a possibility that about 3,000 refugees will arrive. It is now more difficult for immigrants to come to Shanghai from Germany than before. First, they must produce a passport approved by the Chinese side, and then prove that their coming to Shanghai is to find employment or that they have relatives and friends in Shanghai to take care of them before they are allowed to leave. It is reported that Germany will now no longer allow refugees who rely on public assistance to come to Shanghai from Germany, but those who have already booked their berths, about 3,000 people, will be allowed to depart. The refugee situation in Shanghai is not yet causing anxiety, as the housing and funds for the immigrants are still ample. However, if funds are not continuously received, this situation will deteriorate within a month. Currently, immigrants are housed in single men's residences on Huade Road, family residences on Huishan Road, and Riverside Mansion, in addition to those who live in private residences or with friends. A small number also live in new houses on Huasheng Road. These houses are planned to be converted into a hospital, which will be run by doctors and nurses from among the refugees. If the hospital is established according to the current plan, in addition to treating Jewish immigrants, it will also serve the outside world to a large extent.</p>
<h3>The "Puppet City" is Completely Exhausted; The Puppet Officials are Uneasy About the Lack of Funds for the Government Next Month</h3>
<p>The puppet city government has been in a state of panic for days, studying the so-called "terrorist" cases, waving flags and shouting, so that the internal puppet officials, big and small, can focus their attention on these incidents, in order to cover up the danger that the puppet "government" itself is facing economic collapse and to suppress future more serious "terrorist" incidents. Since the puppet "Reformed Government" was jealous of the puppet "city government's" huge monthly "miscellaneous tax" revenue, it used its "superior" status to force Chuan Xiaonong to cancel 38 kinds of puppet "consumption taxes" starting in February, the puppet "government" suffered direct losses of more than 500,000 gold every month. This puppet "government" regarded it as the main artery of economic sources,</p>
<p>Once severed, it could have put the puppet "government" to death. Because apart from these 38 kinds of "consumption taxes," there were only limited puppet housing donations in a corner of Pudong along the coast, and the puppet "vehicle donations" in Nanshi, Pudong, and Huxi, as well as the puppet "ship donations" in the Huangpu River. The former is of a "seasonal donation" nature, and the latter two are of a "annual donation" nature, with very little income. However, the puppet Reformed Government</p>
<p>Once Promised Every Month</p>
<p>To Subsidize 400,000 Yuan, the remaining insufficient amount, the puppet "city government" also planned to levy puppet "land tax" and puppet "business tax" to make up for it. Now February is coming to an end, and the 400,000 yuan subsidy from the puppet "Reformed Government" has proven to be a mere lip service and there is no hope. The two new puppet "taxes" are difficult to collect due to insufficient preparation, so the puppet "government" is doomed</p>
<p>Has Reached Bankruptcy</p>
<p>State, although the puppet officials' "salaries" for February can be barely maintained by patching together, there is no funding for the puppet "expenses" next month. Although various methods are used to cut staff, reduce salaries, and abolish redundant "agencies," there is still no remedy. Chuan Xiaonong has been exhausted by this difficult problem, fearing that the puppet officials will be unwilling to work and cause a disturbance. Therefore, he is using the "terrorist" incident as an excuse to make a big fuss to cover up his economic panic. But everyone expects Chuan's move to be a futile attempt to cover up the truth, because puppet officials are not kind, and cannot be deceived by a single trick.</p>

Last time, when the radio station was test broadcasting to the Far East, Chongqing, Nanjing, Tianjin, and other places could receive it.</p>
<h3>Difficult Sources, Raw Lacquer and Pigments Prices Rise; Affected by the Fall of Yuehan and Foreign Exchange Contraction</h3>
<p>The raw lacquer and pigments sold in this city are usually purchased from the mainland and foreign countries and brought to Shanghai for sale. Since the fall of Yuehan, the source of raw lacquer has been cut off, and the price of pigments has continued to rise due to foreign exchange contraction and time-consuming transportation. The price of raw lacquer had already risen to 280 yuan per dan, and now it has risen to 320 yuan, an increase of 15%. A pound of German-made iron can of pigment used to sell for 2 yuan and 40 cents, but it has risen to 3 yuan and 20 cents, an increase of more than 30%.</p>
<h3>Japanese Depreciate the Value of Legal Tender; Counterfeit Money is Everywhere in North China; Although the Value of Legal Tender is Depressed, It Has Actually Increased in Value; North China Banks Send Personnel to Shanghai to Report</h3>
<p>New Voice News reports that since the implementation of our country's legal tender policy, it has been deeply trusted by Chinese and foreign people due to its sufficient reserves. After the Japanese puppets failed to obtain foreign exchange by using "joint banknotes," they forcibly depreciated the value of legal tender, and Chinese and foreign banks were pressured. The North China banking community has sent personnel to Shanghai to report everything. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Counterfeit Money is Everywhere</p>
<p>Since the fall of Pingjin, the puppet organization in Peiping established the "China Joint Reserve Bank" and issued banknotes without any guarantee, forcing them to circulate in the market. As of January 10 this year, the amount in circulation was about 185 million yuan. In addition, the unguaranteed banknotes issued by the "Manchurian Central Bank" and the "Jidong Bank" circulating in the two cities of Pingjin amounted to about 16 million yuan. Moreover, the Hebei Provincial Bank further expanded its issuance to 58 million yuan. Recently, the "Joint Reserve Bank" also issued three kinds of small-denomination non-convertible banknotes with denominations of five cents, one cent, and half a cent. The scope of circulation is extremely wide, and the amount issued is even unlimited.</p>
<p>Forced Depreciation</p>
<p>The purpose of issuing banknotes by the puppet "Joint Reserve Bank" is to absorb our legal tender and obtain foreign exchange. However, because our government controlled foreign exchange and the people's faith in legal tender became stronger, they would pay with puppet banknotes as soon as they received them. Therefore, the puppet organization's plan to obtain foreign exchange failed, and the circulation of counterfeit money was greatly affected. They then issued an order, first forcibly stopping the circulation of our legal tender in Pingjin and other occupied urban areas, and then limiting the use of Tianjin-named banknotes from the two banks of China and Communications to 90% of their value. From February 20 this year, it was changed to 60%, and from March 10, the circulation of legal tender on the market was stopped.</p>
<p>Oppressing the Market</p>
<p>The puppet "Ministry of Finance" of the puppet "Provisional Government" issued an order to the Peiping Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association, stipulating that from February 20, all deposit and loan contracts signed with the word "legal tender" must be changed to the word "national currency" (referring to the banknotes of the puppet Joint Reserve Bank). If they are not changed, they will be calculated according to the second devaluation rate of 60%. Foreign commercial banks still pay legal tender for the drafts they pay out. If they are checks, they will be divided into legal tender and "puppet currency." During the second devaluation period, foreign commercial bills can only be collected at a 60% discount. If it passes March 10, they will not be able to collect on their behalf.</p>
<p>Actual Currency Situation</p>
<p>In fact, in the various guerrilla areas of North China, and in the concession area of Tianjin and the embassy area of Peiping, legal tender has increased in value by about 2%. Moreover, it has never been heard that anyone is using our legal tender at 90% or 60% of its value. It can be seen that the price of our legal tender is stable as before, and its credit is even stronger. On the contrary, the "counterfeit money" is fully used in the two cities of Pingjin, but in reality, its price is lower than that of legal tender.</p>

<h3>Jealousy Among Flower Game Operators: Shooting Leads to Destruction, One Boy Injured</h3>
<p>Kong Wenbao, a gambler who works as a "table leg" at the Xinxin gambling den in Zhujia Library on Haig Road, has recently opened a Helihua flower game parlor there, enticing people to gamble. Recently, he had a disagreement with the Yonglihua flower game parlor in the same area, leading to a major conflict. On the afternoon of the 24th, at 3:00 PM, Kong led a group of hooligans, carrying handguns, and stormed into Yongli, destroying it and firing several shots, injuring a boy on the spot. Yongli has temporarily closed down and is preparing to retaliate with a group.</p>
<h3>Drug Trafficking Case on the "Hesheng" Ship: Police Issue Arrest Warrant for the Mastermind</h3>
<p>When Jardine Matheson's "Hesheng" ship arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin at the end of last month, the French Concession police discovered a passenger named Li Zhengyun carrying 150 packages of morphine worth tens of thousands of dollars. After interrogation, it was learned that Zhang Ruilin, the manager of a morphine manufacturing facility in Tianjin, had sent Li to Shanghai with the drugs. Li was sentenced to six months in prison by the Second Special District Court. It has now come to light that although the case is closed, the French police have learned that the person in charge of the drug manufacturing facility in Shanghai is Zhang Jintang, who lives at a certain address in Taihe Lane on Paul Beau Road. When the police went to arrest him, Zhang had already fled. The police have now issued an arrest warrant and ordered detectives to apprehend him. It is also reported that Zhang is currently the captain of the Detective Team of the 4th District of the puppet police局.</p>
<h3>Four Thousand Dollars in Cash Robbed</h3>
<p>At 11:30 AM yesterday, eight robbers armed with handguns broke into No. 13, Lane 306, Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession, and after silencing the occupants, made off with a staggering four thousand dollars in cash.</p>
<h3>Land Case in Shengping Lane</h3>
<p>The French police received a tip-off the other day that someone was selling opium in No. 5, Shengping Lane on Avenue Edward VII. They immediately dispatched detectives to search the premises, seizing more than two pounds of opium wrapped in paper inside a leather bag. However, the men, Liao Weizhang and Liu Changsheng, had already fled. Only two landladies, Liao Chen and Liao Shen, and a tenant, Liu Wang, all from Chaozhou, were taken to the police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. Judge Miao interrogated them. The police requested an extension to apprehend the fugitive masterminds and investigate the case before bringing charges. Liu Wang confessed to living with Liao Shen but denied selling opium, stating that her husband, Liu Changsheng, was away. Liao Shen stated that she had recently married into the Liao family, that her husband, Liao Weizhang, was in the game business, that Chen was her mother-in-law, and that she was unaware of any opium sales. Liao Chen also denied selling opium. After verifying the statements, the court adjourned the hearing and ordered the defendants to be detained.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Opium Leads to Murder: Convicted Murderer Appeals, Verdict to Be Announced Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Shi Xiaodi and other gangsters from Chongming were searching for opium in the Huangpu River on the night of November 3rd last year. A man named Xiao Guilin, who made a living rowing boats in the Huangpu River, was suspected by Shi Xiaodi and others of hiding opium on his boat. They ordered him to stop in the middle of the river for a search. When Xiao refused, Shi Xiaodi and others jumped onto Xiao Guilin's boat and stabbed Xiao's throat with a sharp knife. Xiao resisted with his hands and was stabbed several more times. The injuries to his throat were fatal, and he died on the spot. Afterward, the murderer Shi Xiaodi was arrested by the French Concession police and sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. Judge Qiu Qingbang found him guilty and sentenced Shi Xiaodi to eighteen years in prison for murder and three years and six months for illegal search, to be served concurrently for a total of twenty years. Shi Xiaodi appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court, claiming the sentence was unjust. The case was brought before the Third Criminal Court by Presiding Judge Wu Tingqi and Judges Wang Yue and Chen Daqi. The appellant, Shi Xiaodi, stated, "It is true that I jumped onto the deceased's boat to search for opium. However, after I jumped on, the deceased grabbed me and shouted, 'Robber!' I couldn't escape. I was very scared. I saw a fruit knife on the boat, and I picked it up to scare him into letting me go. I didn't expect to accidentally stab him to death. It was manslaughter, not intentional murder. The original sentence of twenty years is too heavy. I request the court to be lenient." The court reviewed the case and adjourned the hearing. The appellant, Shi Xiaodi, was remanded in custody. The verdict will be announced on the 28th.</p>

<h3>Ye Qirong Uses Special Influence to Seize Shopfront for Business: Dachangcheng Cigarette Shop Illegally Occupied, Shareholders Helplessly Resort to Legal Action</h3>
<p>Ye Qirong, the manager of the Yuqingfeng Cigarette Paper Shop on Rue du Consulat in the French Concession, opened a Yuji Trading Company in partnership with a Japanese person after the National Army withdrew to the west and the Japanese army occupied Pudong. Ye served as the manager of the company on Dongchang Road in Pudong. At the time, there were few shops in Pudong, so the business thrived, generating substantial profits. Later, the owner of Yuqingfeng, Rong Chenghao, concerned that Ye, as the manager of his shop, was also partnering in a trading company with the</p>
<p>brand name "Yuji," which might cause confusion, requested Ye to change the name of the trading company. Ye reluctantly changed the name of Yuji Trading Company to Datong Cigarette Paper Company. Ye had a relative, a woman named Liu Chen, who had co-founded the Dachangcheng Cigarette Paper Shop on Pingliang Road. After the August 13th Incident, the shop ceased operations due to the situation. Toward the end of last winter, they began to liquidate the business. Ye, coveting the shopfront of Dachangcheng, incited Liu Chen to dissolve the partnership. Ye intended to rely on</p>
<p>special influence to change the name of Dachangcheng to Dachangxiang and open for business. However, the other shareholders of Dachangcheng intended to reopen the business after the liquidation. Therefore, they sent an employee named Wang Rongxian to live in the shop to safeguard it. Unexpectedly, on the 28th of last month, Ye, along with representatives from Liu Chen, went to Dachangcheng and forced Wang to leave the shop. Wang</p>
<p>dared not resist and moved to the shop across the street, owned by his friend Qiu Hongfu. He then accompanied Zhang Guanlan, the manager of Dachangcheng, to the Yulin Road police station to report the situation to the police chief, who suggested filing a lawsuit in court. Ye and others became angry at Qiu Hongfu and reported him to the Japanese military police on the 1st of this month, resulting in Qiu Hongfu, Qiu Amao, and Lu Zhiqing being</p>
<p>detained by the Japanese military. After being interrogated and found to have committed no crime, they were released. Qiu and others believed that the ordeal was caused by Ye Qirong and Liu Chen. They then hired lawyer Zong Yong to file a lawsuit against Ye and others in the First Special District Court for infringement of freedom. The case was heard by Judge Jiang the other day, who ordered a postponement to March 3rd for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Local Area Experiences Rain and Snow Yesterday</h3>
<p>The weather in the local area has been erratic recently, alternating between warm and cold, sunny and rainy. Yesterday morning began with a heavy fog that did not dissipate until noon. The weather was slightly colder than the previous day. Unexpectedly, around 3:00 PM, it began to rain again. Initially, it was a light rain, followed by continuous drizzle. Around 4:00 PM, large snowflakes mixed with the rain, which is commonly called "rain-snow mix." It lasted for about half an hour before stopping. However, the fog in the air remained thick, with moisture filling the sky.</p>
<h3>Owner of Egg Shop Hides Mistress in Luxury, Wife Reports to Police, Captures Pair of Lovebirds, Criminal Charges to Be Filed in Court</h3>
<p>Yang Ruitang, a Yongren from the city, owner of the Yangruiji Egg Shop at 696 Xinzha Road, is 29 years old. He was betrothed in childhood to Chen Xiuqing, a woman from the same hometown, and they married in their hometown in 1929. They had a son, now four years old. The couple's relationship was generally harmonious. Later, Yang Ruitang's</p>
<p>egg business prospered. He was hired by the Peilin Egg Shop in the city to be a buyer at the branch in Rugao (now dismissed). As a result, he had some savings and his lifestyle became more affluent. He then became fickle and spent his days indulging in pleasure outside. His feelings for Chen became increasingly cold. After the August 13th Shanghai Battle, Chen took her son</p>
<p>to Ningbo to seek refuge. Initially, Yang sent her a monthly allowance to support her. Unexpectedly, he stopped payments in August of last year. Chen, feeling completely helpless, came to Shanghai at the end of last year to look for him. She only recently learned that Yang had opened a new egg shop on Xinzha Road and was living with a prostitute named Yin Suzhen, realizing that her husband had</p>
<p>committed adultery and abandoned her maliciously. Unwilling to accept this, she hired lawyer Zhang Juansheng and reported it to the Xinzha Police Station the other day, requesting an investigation. After the police chief approved it, he dispatched Chinese and Western detectives, along with the plaintiff, to search the premises around midnight the other night. They</p>
<p>captured the pair of lovebirds and took them to the police station. Because Yang is a respectable businessman, he was granted bail. It is reported that the plaintiff intends to file criminal charges against Yang Ruitang and his mistress, Yin Suzhen, in court.</p>
<h3>Abuse of Adopted Daughter: Six Months Imprisonment, Three Years Probation</h3>
<p>Wang Lairong, a 13-year-old adopted daughter of Lu Gu, a local woman residing at 405 Haifang Road, was recently abused and beaten by Lu, leaving her with injuries all over her body. On the evening of the 23rd of this month, at 8:30 PM, Lu returned home from a relative's place and learned that Wang Lairong had stolen copper coins. She then beat her severely with firewood, causing significant injuries to her arms and back. Wang took the opportunity to escape and dared not return home. The next day at noon, she was wandering and crying near Sanhe Lane in Xiaoshadu when two children named Jin Di and Hai Da saw her and told their father, Wu Genbao, who questioned her about the matter. He took her to the Gordon Road Police Station and informed the police chief. The police chief ordered her to go to Guangren Hospital, where a doctor confirmed her injuries, and then sent her to Jiliang Institute for temporary care. Detective Xu Guirong was secretly dispatched to 405 Haifang Road and brought Lu Gu to the police station. Yesterday, she was brought to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Kaiyin elaborated on the case and filed a public prosecution for the crime of abuse under Article 286, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, submitting the doctor's report for inspection. Wang testified that her original name was Rong, and at the age of eight, her father sold her to Lu Gu as an adopted daughter, whom she called mother, and described the beatings she endured. When questioned, Lu Gu denied beating her with firewood, but her answers were evasive, and she begged for leniency. Judge Huang Risheng sentenced Lu Zhang to six months imprisonment with three years probation. Wang Lairong was temporarily sent to Jiliang Institute for care.</p>
<h3>Attempt to Evade Legal Fees: Fines Imposed</h3>
<p>Chen Kaifu, a Yancheng native who performs Yangzhou opera, was arrested by the Xinzha Police Station in the Public Concession on suspicion of theft and sent to the Second Special District Court for trial. His wife, Chen Zhang, hired female lawyer Yu Xiufang to defend him, agreeing on a fee of 400 yuan, of which only 100 yuan was paid in advance. The trial resulted in Chen being declared innocent. Afterward, lawyer Yu repeatedly urged Chen to pay the remaining 300 yuan in legal fees. Unexpectedly, Chen Zhang led her nephew Chen Dehong and hooligans to surround Yu's law office, forcing Yu to nullify the signed retainer agreement. Yu reported this to the French police, who dispatched detectives to arrest Chen Zhang and Chen Dehong. They were sent to the Second District Court for trial. The plaintiff, Yu Xiufang, testified to the above facts and also made a civil claim, requesting that Chen and others publish an apology in the newspaper and decorate her office with red ribbons and greenery. The defendants, Chen and others, denied threatening or coercing her. Judge Zhang Minxian concluded the trial and announced the verdict yesterday, fining Chen Zhang and Chen Dehong 200 yuan each. The civil claim was transferred to the Civil Division of the court.</p>
<h3>Encroachment on Field Deeds: One Case, Two Lawsuits, Court Suspends Trial</h3>
<p>After the death of Yu Xiangzhou, a Wuxi native and owner of the Dechangji Iron Shop on North Suzhou Road, the deeds to the ancestral fields in his hometown were all in the hands of his second wife, Zhang. The manager of the shop, Rong Nansen (Xiangzhou's nephew), took 49 field deeds and 17 rent receipts from Zhang two years ago, claiming to register them with the local land administration bureau, but never returned them. The sisters Yu Yinfang and Yinfang, Xiangzhou's daughters, jointly filed a criminal lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Rong Nansen for encroachment. The trial was held by Judge Shen the other afternoon. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant had given the deeds to their half-brother, Yu Xiaozhou, and had already changed the name of the household. He had also altered the Dechang accounting books without permission, making the shop exclusively owned by Xiaozhou. Rong testified that the deeds had been taken by Yu Xiaozhou. After the court reviewed the case, it was noted that Yu Zhang had already filed a lawsuit and the court had ruled that the plaintiff should first file a civil lawsuit. Therefore, it was inappropriate to change the plaintiff and file two lawsuits for one case. The court ordered the trial to be suspended.</p>
<p>Doing Good is the Greatest Joy</p>
<h3>Opium Addiction Spreads Rampantly in Western Shanghai: Opium Dealer Sells Five Boxes of Opium, Establishes General Bureau to Manage All Opium Dens, Harming the People Beyond Comprehension</h3>
<p>Jiang Yumen, an opium dealer from Chaozhou, was previously wanted by the Songhu Garrison Command for smuggling red pills but was never apprehended. Recently, he colluded with his fellow townsmen Liu Zheran, Lan Bason, Zheng Chuanying, and others to establish a general bureau for selling opium in the Xinkang Lane of Caojiadu Wujiaochang. He paid a deposit of 100,000 yuan to the Japanese side and obtained the exclusive right to sell drugs. All wholesale opium business for large and small opium dens in Western Shanghai is exclusively managed by this opium general bureau. As a result, Jiang and others have profited greatly. Recently, they signed a contract with the Japanese side to sell five large boxes of opium every day, and the profits are divided equally with the Japanese side. As a result, opium addiction in Western Shanghai is spreading more and more rampantly, harming the people beyond comprehension.</p>
<h3>Pharmacy Employee Dies by Poisoning: Why So Many Suicides?</h3>
<p>Ye Yunlong, a Ningbo native, 30 years old, was an employee of the Gutianren Pharmacy at 110 Shandong Road. Due to economic pressure, he suddenly had suicidal thoughts.

<h3>Jealousy Leads to Stabbing</h3>
<p>Qiu Tang, a 31-year-old woman from Hubei, lived at 4 Laotai'an Lane, Santai Road. Recently, her husband was arrested by the police and sent to court for eating opium and sentenced to imprisonment. With no one to support her, she had an affair with Xu Guishi, a fellow townsman. She then became involved with a man named Liu Linxiang. On the afternoon of the other day, at 6:00 PM, Xu Guishi invited three friends, Chang Yijiang, Sun Xiangyun, and Xu Dexing, and hid small foreign knives. They broke into Qiu Tang's house and harassed her, stabbing her in the left arm. Liu Linxiang was also stabbed by them and took the opportunity to escape. Later, Chinese Constable No. 1770 arrived and arrested Chang Yijiang and the other two, taking them to the Huisi Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, the police sent Chang and the other two to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Kaiyin described the incident in detail and requested an extension. Chinese Constable No. 1770 reported the arrest of the three defendants.

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Dynamics of China's Banking Industry in 1938</h3>
<p>— Yang Zheng</p>
<p>The banking industry is the center of financial institutions, so its business growth and the prosperity or decline of the social economy are closely related. Especially during wartime, the banking business in 1938 was even more clearly affected by the war of resistance. As the war zone expanded, it extended from the coastal river basins to the southwestern provinces. This change is worth paying close attention to and is sufficient for future research, but the collection of materials is not easy. The author has systematically compiled the situation of the banking industry as recorded in various newspapers and publications to show the dynamics of the banking industry over the past year. However, omissions and errors in what I have heard and seen are inevitable. Moreover, what is recorded in newspapers is often publicized before it becomes a reality. If there are any errors in this, I hope you will forgive me.</p>
<p>1.  Establishment of Banks</p>
<p>In 1938, due to the impact of the war, only two new banks were established: the He Cheng Bank in Chongqing and the Chongqing Municipal Bank. The former had a capital of 600,000 yuan and was expanded from the He Cheng Money Shop, opening in January. The latter opened on July 1st. Only two banks ceased operations: the Jiading Bank in Jiading and the Tonghe Bank in Shanghai. The former was founded in February of the 11th year of the Republic (1922), with a capital of 100,000 yuan. In the 13th year of the Republic (1924), the capital was increased by 100,000 yuan, bringing the total to 200,000 yuan. On June 13th of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), registration was approved by the Ministry of Finance. On October 11th of this year, it declared closure due to lack of working capital. After the city chamber of commerce attempted reconciliation, creditors agreed at a meeting on November 26th to resume operations on a scheduled date. The latter was founded on May 25th of the 14th year of the Republic (1925), with a capital of 500,000 yuan. It ceased operations on October 21st of the 27th year of the Republic (1938) and applied to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for reconciliation in accordance with the Bankruptcy Law. The savings portion was formally reconciled on December 13th of this year, while the commercial portion remains to be resolved.</p>
<p>During this year, the Guangzhou Silk Industry Bank and the Guangdong Industrial Bank were merged into the Guangdong Provincial Bank. The former was founded on March 18th of the 19th year of the Republic (1930), with a capital of 500,000 yuan, and was merged into the Guangdong Provincial Bank in January of this year. The latter was founded on January 1st of the 25th year of the Republic (1936) by the Guangdong Provincial Government, with a capital of 5 million silver dollars, of which only 1 million silver dollars were actually paid up. It was merged into the Guangdong Provincial Bank on February 21st. The capital of the Guangdong Provincial Bank was originally 15 million yuan. After the merger of the Silk Industry Bank and the Guangdong Industrial Bank, the capital remained at 15 million yuan. The only bank that resumed operations was the Shanghai Hengli Bank. The bank ceased operations on August 9th of the 26th year of the Republic (1937). After applying for reconciliation with the city chamber of commerce, it resumed operations on October 4th of this year. The capital remained at 750,000 yuan. Except for the suspension of the savings department, other commercial transactions, trust, custody, and other businesses continued to operate.</p>
<p>2.  Reduction and Addition of Bank Branches</p>
<p>The closing of bank branches is entirely based on business changes. Over the past year, a total of eleven have been closed, including five offices, three branches, two sub-branches, and one remittance office. Regionally, there were five in Jiangsu, two in Fujian, and one each in Jiangxi, Sichuan, Hebei, and Guangdong. The following is a list:</p>
<p>Bank Name Address Type Month/Day Notes</p>
<p>Siming Bank West Gate, Shanghai Branch January 1st Handled by Xiahfei Road Branch</p>
<p>Ditto City Area, Shanghai Office Ditto Continued by Nanshi Branch</p>

<p>Central Bank Beiping Branch November 1st</p>
<p>Jiaotong Bank Jielu, Shanghai Branch Ditto Continued by Nanjing Road Branch</p>
<p>Ditto Tilanqiao, Shanghai Ditto Ditto</p>
<p>Since the war moved westward, the center of China's financial industry has also gradually shifted to the southwestern provinces, especially Chongqing, which has replaced the old Shanghai. In order for China to achieve long-term resistance and final victory, bank funds must move inland, so as to build the foundation of wartime industry and commerce, and to develop the rural areas of the interior. Therefore, the addition of many branches in the interior this year is a clear indication of this. There are a total of 90, including 42 offices and one sub-association. By bank type, provincial and municipal banks account for 39, commercial banks account for 26, government and franchised banks account for 24, and overseas Chinese-operated banks account for 1. Among them, provincial and municipal banks have the most additions, with 24 in Sichuan, 13 in Hunan, 6 in Guangdong, 3 in Hubei, and 2 each in Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Xikang, and Guizhou, and 1 in Gansu.

<p>3.  Post-War Arrangements for Banks in War Zones</p>
<p>Although banks in the war zones suffered significant losses, their lines were still very solid. Not only were there few bankruptcies, but also to facilitate depositors, they mostly tried to move to safe areas and conduct business as usual. This good post-war management phenomenon is of course due to the fact that each bank has clearly understood its own responsibility in the war of resistance, but in reality it is also the success of China's wartime financial policy.

<h3>Finance: Scarcity Makes It Valuable: Gold Prices Rise for Six Consecutive Days, Totaling 85 Yuan, and Ornaments Reach 217 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for cash gold was dull due to the weekly holiday, and there were very few people gathered. However, the city's wealthy still had a strong desire to purchase and store it, and entrusted a certain money exchange to purchase it on their behalf. However, sellers all regarded it as valuable due to its scarcity, and supply was quite weak. The market continued to move towards a new high in this price increase trend. This was actually due to the exhaustion of chips and the heavy demand from various gangs. At 10:45, a certain money exchange entered the silver building gang, with 30 taels at 2,241 yuan as the midday closing price, an increase of 6 yuan from the previous day (it has risen for six consecutive days, totaling 85 yuan). It was also heard that a certain money exchange sold 50 taels to a local gang after 10:00 at 2,140 yuan. As a result, gold ornaments in silver shops were also listed at a high of 1 yuan at noon, with Lao Qingyun and other major players changing to 217 yuan, and new players to 215 yuan, buying in at 209 yuan. In addition, a London telegram on the 25th stated that British pure gold continued to fall by one point per ounce due to the continued high value of the pound, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 2.5 points.</p>
<h3>Large Silver Bars Shrink Again Recently, Indian Silver Prices Fluctuate</h3>
<p>A London telegram on the 25th stated that speculators were selling and India was buying, while investors were watching and the market was still flat. Large silver bars shrank by .0625 in the near term, while the far term remained stable. A New York silver telegram stated that American silver prices remained stable as before. A Bombay silver telegram stated that Indian silver prices fluctuated, with spot prices shrinking by one anna and near and far terms rising by one anna.</p>
<h3>Securities: A Week's Report on the Chinese and Western Stock Markets</h3>
<p>Last week, trading of foreign stocks outside the Public Stock Exchange, though only active for two and a half days, was quite remarkable. The prices of several stocks reached new highs since August 13th. These included Shanghai Gas, Tramways, bearer shares, Kung Ho Hsiang, and Shanghai Rubber ordinary shares.</p>
<p>International Savings Society shares attracted much attention from operators, with exceptionally high trading volume, exceeding 50,000 shares for the entire week. Prices fluctuated between $3.35 and $3.50, closing at $3.45 at the weekend.</p>
<p>Shanghai Land Investment also saw nearly 30,000 shares traded last week, with prices ranging from $8.50 to $8.90, closing at $8.85.</p>
<p>Shanghai Rubber ordinary shares saw over 12,000 shares traded. The price rose from an initial $6.30 to $6.40. At the weekend, two transactions totaling 800 shares pushed the price even higher to $6.60.</p>
<p>Shanghai Land last week also rose in price. The previous week, because of the indirect impact of the Jiangwan Racecourse being purchased by the Japanese, there was widespread belief that the Broadway Mansions might also be sold off. As a result, the market price jumped from $8.90 to $9.50.

<h3>Medicinal Materials: Amomum Villosum Supply Cut Off</h3>
<p>Amomum villosum is produced in Qiongyai.  Recently, as that area has been occupied, the source has been cut off. Although the existing stock is plentiful, there is unanimous expectation of rising prices. When trading opened in the market, each dan (unit of weight) was priced at $18.  Previously, it only sold for $13.50.  Currently, the market has increased by $4, but current sales are only sporadic. If demand expands, it will continue to rise.</p>
<h3>Dried and Sundry Goods: High-Quality Sun-Dried Longan Pulp Up By About One Dollar</h3>
<p>Shima sun-dried longan pulp, more than a dozen packages had arrived before the big year-end closing. Yesterday, samples were viewed, the color, slices, and quality were all excellent. The opening price was immediately $1.60 higher than before. The packaged variety, a certain firm opened more than one hundred packages yesterday, the price was $210, and the market seems to have settled temporarily. The market price did not rise or fall. Sophora flower buds are very scarce at the base and the source is also lacking, with only sporadic sales, priced at $20.</p>
<h3>Metals: Limited Sales After Price Increase of Native-Made Nails</h3>
<p>Native-made wire nails from local factories have seen shortages of raw materials (coiled wire and wire), and the factory has thus hoarded goods to drive up prices. The price has been raised to $17 per barrel (Bessemer). During the end of the lunar year, hoarders and out-of-town merchants competed to purchase them, so trading was quite lively. Recently, seeing market gains, the factory has softened its stance as there have been no new developments in actual sales. Yesterday, only two to three hundred barrels were traded, with the price still at $17. It is heard that for large-scale transactions, the price can still be negotiated. As for small flower-patterned nails, their trading is still quite considerable. Yesterday, local shops and out-of-town merchants sold a total of fifty to sixty barrels. The price for 4-fen nails was $36 per barrel, 5-fen nails $31, and 6-fen nails $26. If one wants to export, the customer must bear the customs duties.</p>
<h3>American Galvanized Iron Sheet Sales Still Strong</h3>
<p>American galvanized iron sheets, because of their excellent quality and dazzling shine, are not squeezed out by Japanese goods in the market. Asking prices remain stubbornly high. Since the past few days, because of strong actual sales, merchants from Fujian, Wenzhou, Ningbo, Tianjin, and other regions have made purchases, with two to three hundred bundles being sold. The price for 48-sheet thin iron is $3.78 per sheet, and thick iron such as number 28 is $34.50 per dan, number 26 is $33.75 per dan, number 24 is $31.75 per dan, and numbers 18 to 22 are $32.50 per dan. Local trading is also considerable. But as foreign exchange tightens and sources diminish, the industry holders are very firm and do not relax asking prices for the coming market.</p>
<h3>Grains: White Japonica Rice Called Higher</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the source of national rice from the lower reaches of the river had not arrived. The train brought three to four thousand packages of steamed buns. After the market tightened from the afternoon before yesterday, the opening of trading yesterday morning saw upward momentum. The stockpilers were very interested, stimulating activity in this area. At the same time, sellers called for higher prices and held their ground, so that the result was that except for high-grade thick japonica rice, which was slightly higher because of price, the middle-grade goods all rose by two to three jiao. The situation for thin paddy special goods was similar, and the middle grade was also firmer, rising from corner to corner to two jiao. Du Yang Jian Bu Jian Gao Ding Ci Xiu changed from a yuan of red market. After that, he saw his wings and only calmed down.</p>
<h3>Coal: Coal Ball Factory Market Firm</h3>
<p>Coal briquette factories stopped work for several days during the Spring Festival and could not deliver goods, resulting in unusually empty merchant stalls in the city, and the demand for goods was urgent. The factories have opened in the past few days, with sales boosted and over a thousand tons sold. The selling price is firm, Yitai Hing coal balls are priced at $33 per ton, Nanyang Double Dragon old brand is $32, a sub brand $29.50, and smaller factories are cheaper by five or six jiao. Those same businessmen take care of transporting the coal, with an extra fee paid. It is heard that the new Yitai Hing factory has also been formally established and will begin shipping.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Side of the Cotton Spinning Industry: How Miserable Are These Times!</h3>
<p>Reading Mr. Yuan's article "The Unprecedented Profits of the Cotton Spinning Industry" in this newspaper is indeed praising an outsider. He talks about a chance to make a fortune that comes once in a thousand years. However, Mr. Yuan only knows one thing but not the other. He only knows the joyous side but not the tragic side. The Hudong area, which also belongs to the Concession, can be said to be the culmination of Chinese cotton mills. Not one did not make huge profits. Since being trapped in the smoke and gunfire of war, the tragic side of the cotton spinning industry in this occupied area is truly unbearable to recall.</p>
<p>(A) In the occupied area, the cotton mills, machinery, and goods were either looted or destroyed by artillery fire and were left in a shambles. Some were forced into cooperation (completely seized). Those with integrity who were unwilling to cooperate watched their machines rust and watched the Shanghai West cotton mills make profits of thousands and tens of thousands. Looking back at their own means of production, immobilized under violent seizure, what a tragic situation this is.</p>
<p>(B) The cotton mills trapped in the war zone were unable to operate their means of production. Before the war, "unpaid accounts" for things such as hardware, materials, fuel, gunny sacks, ropes, and bamboo strips, amounted to thousands for large debts and dozens for small debts. Creditors flocked to them at the end of the year to press for repayment. Some foreign firms even disregarded the history and feelings of ten or twenty years of dealings with the factories and actually hired lawyers to issue their formal ultimatum, resorting to legal action. It is originally not to blame, but this is a huge disaster that is irresistible by human forces. The so-called "eating the dead without spitting out bones" is true. Where does the factory get the money to deal with this? They could only lower their heads and make excuses to get by.</p>
<p>(C) The disbanded groups of unemployed people wandered aimlessly. Even the small number of retained workers who received only forty to fifty percent of their pre-war salary felt that their lives were strained, prices soared, and they were already suffering from robbing Peter to pay Paul. At the end of the year, they saw that other people's pockets were full, while they were "pitted by fate" and their purses were empty. There are probably many who pawned their belongings to get through the year (the end of the year).</p>
<p>(D) Friends who unfortunately worked in cotton trading in the war zone lost all their houses and cotton, and fled to the isolated island empty-handed. Some were even cotton bosses before the war, but after the war, they couldn't even find a position on the isolated island that paid more than ten gold coins a month. This is what the author heard with his own ears.</p>
<p>"Is it better to enjoy happiness alone or to share it with others?" I think that the factories with unprecedented profits should also take care of this (Long Junsheng).</p>
<h3>The Radiant Smile of the Woolen Industry</h3>
<p>The price of woolen goods on the 27th has always been high. Although the business of out-of-town merchants has suddenly decreased, the local market trading is more prosperous than in the past. The large and small shops in the industry have made very large profits. Those who operate stores that do straight sales have extra profits. Those who have old inventory and large quantities of inventory purchased in the spring and summer have especially large profits. Therefore, all the woolen industry colleagues, large and small, have made great profits. The awarding of year-end bonuses made employees and managers happy, and there were many who were radiant with smiles. Now, we are investigating and publishing the net profits of colleagues. Those who did not earn more than 5,000 yuan are not included.</p>

<h3>In-Service Secondary School Teachers' Professional Development Issues After the Establishment of Teachers Colleges (3)</h3>
<p>— Huang Shijin</p>
<p>(3) Professional Development Opportunities for Teachers After the Establishment of Teachers Colleges</p>
<p>The current situation of secondary school teachers in China is such that the remedial measures must of course be professional development. However, in the past, there was only one normal university in the country, and teachers found it difficult to find a place for professional development. Because there were no opportunities in the country in the past, many went abroad for professional development. However, studying abroad is far from home, costly, and the learning does not fit the national conditions. In addition, the atmosphere for professional development has always been cold. Teacher qualifications have not been emphasized. Therefore, most teachers do not feel the need for professional development. As a result, they follow their inertia and muddle along, and it has come to this day. Now that the proposition for teacher training is very different from the past, teachers' views on professional development should also change rapidly. In European and American countries, great importance is attached to teachers' professional development. Educational administrative authorities, school authorities, and teachers themselves are all working hard to promote effective professional development methods. After the establishment of teacher colleges in China, on the one hand, it is necessary to train healthy teachers for the future. On the other hand, appropriate opportunities should also be given for the professional development of in-service teachers. Otherwise, future graduates of teacher colleges will come out class by class, and these outdated in-service teachers will be eliminated batch by batch. In the end, the result will not be a tragedy of a large number of unqualified teachers becoming unemployed, but a trend of new and old teachers competing for jobs. The Ministry of Education is aware of this, so Article 5 of the Teacher College Regulations stipulates that "Teacher colleges should work with the educational administrative organs in the area to thoroughly investigate the needs of secondary school teachers in the area in order to have a planned enrollment." At the same time, Articles 12, 13, and 14 stipulate that teacher colleges may set up teacher research institutes and recruit in-service secondary school teachers of various levels to take professional development certificates as diplomas for teacher certification. The former is to closely recruit new students, and the latter is to take care of in-service teachers. After the destruction of this war, the economy of both the country and individuals will inevitably be difficult. Secondary schools may not be able to add more, and secondary school teachers are therefore easy to be excessive. Teacher colleges should recruit fewer new students and open more professional development classes to allow teachers with existing experience to increase their professional training opportunities. This method is not only effective and fast, but also more economical. Furthermore, the teachers who have completed the professional development have also obtained a guarantee of their position and will not be in danger of being eliminated.</p>

<h3>Donghua Wins Against Lax Again with a Score of 6-3; Leading 4-1 in the First Half</h3>
<p>In the first round of the West Union Football First Division, Donghua had already narrowly defeated its strong opponent, Lax, with a score of 4-3. Yesterday morning, they met again in the second round. The audience expected a fierce battle. Unexpectedly, Lax's performance has been declining recently. Yesterday, Favor was not even on the field, and the forwards had no room to maneuver. As a result, they lost convincingly with a score of 6-3. Donghua led 4-1 in the first half, much to the delight of the audience. Although rain threatened yesterday morning, the audience at Yiyuan Field still numbered in the thousands.</p>
<p>Donghua Team:</p>
<p>Zhou Dayun, Zhuang Youren, Jiang Zhaoxiang, Shu Shigeng, Xu Chengxun, Lin Dianhua, Wan Xianghua, Wu Binghao, Dai Linjing, Shen Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Lax Team:</p>
<p>Brote Lee, Luo Lin Buxini Qing, Shi Simon, Ke Xu Naineng, Mike Deng, Ge Bo Liening, Si Yinggelun, Ke Mada, Kai Pusi Ding</p>
<p>Two Goals in a Row: Donghua kicked off with a strong offensive. Dai and Jia penetrated deeply twice but failed to score. Binghao's shot also went wide. At this time, the Lax team was besieged on all sides, and the situation was completely controlled by Donghua. Before long, A Dai was about to shoot when Simmons suddenly rushed up and collided with him head-on. A Dai made a hook shot, which was brilliant, but unfortunately, it hit the post and bounced back. After eight minutes of stalemate, A Dai passed to Wan Jin, who then sent it to the center. Jia and Shen rushed in at the same time, and Youliang precisely hit the ball, making it 1-0, Donghua taking the lead eight minutes into the game. Lax counterattacked, and Kepusiding shot from close range, but Dayun saved the ball skillfully. Boli Ning rushed up, and Jiang Zhaoxiang kicked the ball out of danger. At 14 minutes, Youliang passed to Shiyan. Brote tried to block Shiyan, but Shiyan had already passed to Wan Jin, who pushed the ball into the empty net, making it 2-0.</p>
<p>Leading 4-1: Donghua scored two consecutive goals, and the Lax team became even more sluggish. At 28 minutes, the Lax team suddenly showed its edge, and Mike Deng unleashed his only fierce shot, which grazed past the goal, becoming a wasted opportunity. Unexpectedly, only two minutes later, Mada rushed to the goal like a flying arrow, kicking fiercely. Dayun dived, but the ball still slipped in, Lax winning a goal (2-1). Wanting to catch up, the entire army advanced, intending to launch a sharp attack, leaving the defense empty. At 34 minutes, A Dai saw the weakness and charged with the ball, successfully breaking through, with no one around. He calmly scored, making it 3-1. Five minutes later, A Dai made another beautiful shot, and Donghua took an absolute advantage with a score of 4-1 in the first half.</p>
<p>Sudden Turnaround: After the lemon break, the situation became unusually dull, with a stalemate lasting for more than 20 minutes. Both sides' offensives were split three ways, with Donghua still occupying two parts. It was not until 24 minutes that Mike Deng took a long shot from afar, and Dayun thought it would go wide but unexpectedly rolled into the left corner (4-2). Donghua suffered an unexpected loss. At 33 minutes, Kepusiding shot from the side, and the ball hit the left post, bouncing to the near side. Dayun rushed up to save, but Boli Ning, Yinggelun, and Mada rushed in together, knocking him down and injuring his abdomen with a kick from Boli Ning. He lay on the ground for a minute, and the ball flew past the goal, a very dangerous situation. Fortunately, Zhaoxiang kicked it out. At 39 minutes, Shen Shiyan picked the ball, and Lee returned it. Lin Dianhua took a long shot from 30 yards, hitting the crossbar. Brote jumped up to save, and although the ball was patted out, it had already crossed the goal line, making it 5-2. Two minutes later, A Dai scored again, making it 6-2. One minute later, Mada took a shot, which went diagonally into the right corner, making it 6-3.

<h3>Lido Crushes Russian Club with 27 Goals; Unprecedented Record of Wide-Open Defense; Russian Club Barely Scored One Goal Back</h3>
<p>In the West Union Football Division C match, Lido played against the Russian Club yesterday afternoon at Jiaozhou Park in the rain. The strength of the two sides was vastly different, and Lido controlled the entire game. Lido's five forwards repeatedly broke through the enemy's goal. The Russian Club was at a loss and could not recover. They tried their best to score a goal in the first half to avoid a shutout. Lido scored nine goals in one breath, ending the first half with a score of 9-1. After the lemon break, Lido scored another 14 goals. In the end, several players from the Russian Club withdrew, and only seven players remained to fight, and the team's lineup was extremely depleted. The overall situation became increasingly fragmented, and they were defeated by Lido with a score of 1-27. Such a huge score is almost like a basketball record. The other Division C match between Gongyuan United and Weisheng was not played because Weisheng team members had to go on duty.</p>

The Jewish team's plan failed, and they lost again with a score of 8-15. In the third game, the Shanghai Women's team went all out, scoring repeatedly and becoming more and more courageous, winning again with a score of 15-7.

<h3>Suggestions to the School Principal</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>The educational sector's movement to save the nation through thrift has reportedly achieved considerable success since its launch, which is truly gratifying! I don't know exactly how each school is implementing it, but I have some opinions that I would like to share with the esteemed principals. As this concerns the public good, I believe you will all agree.</p>
<p>Children and young people in this isolated island are fortunate to be able to study peacefully in these times. However, I believe that among them, there are many students whose parents are similar to refugees, suffering from the impact of the war and experiencing financial difficulties everywhere. Now, asking their children to save the nation through thrift is, of course, their undeniable duty, as they are slightly better off than the refugees. However, the leaders of this movement, especially the esteemed principals, must take this into consideration and show understanding so that they can fulfill this obligation without incurring additional expenses, achieving the best of both worlds.</p>
<p>I believe that since it is called saving the nation through thrift, we should focus on the word "thrift." In addition to the frugality of students' families and the students themselves, the school should also save on waste and use cheaper supplies if possible. As far as I know, there are many things that can be saved or substituted in schools at all levels. For example, a box of crayons or paints in elementary schools costs six or seven cents, which, in my opinion, are luxuries in this era. Other drawing paper and various notebooks should be saved whenever possible, and even if they cannot be saved, there are ways to utilize waste materials, and it is not necessary to demand uniformity. As for middle schools and universities, where consumption is even greater, there are even more things that can be saved or substituted. If the esteemed principals pay attention to this and implement frugality, I believe that in addition to solving the problem of disaster relief donations and achieving the target amount, there will be other benefits as well: First, general savings in material resources, enabling less material resources to achieve greater effectiveness; Second, because most educational supplies are imported, this can reduce the outflow of funds.</p>
<p>Furthermore, parents will be happy to donate if they see the school saving for their children, even the poorest ones, because they don't need to spend much in addition to the predetermined tuition and miscellaneous fees, and they will certainly not object. Perhaps the best way is for the esteemed principals to directly designate savings on certain supplies and transfer the fees already paid for those items to disaster relief donations, in addition to voluntary contributions. This will make things even easier.</p>
<p>The above are my "personal views," and I wonder what the wise principals think?</p>
<h3>Departure</h3>
<p>— Gong Shuhui</p>
<p>The principal is a broom, sweeping back and forth on the playground; many students are fallen leaves, rolling back and forth with the broom.</p>
<p>The principal, with drooping eyelids, tilted his head and swept to the school gate, saying, "Everyone turn left, face me!"</p>
<p>Under the fate of the broom, the fallen leaves rolled to the left in unison.</p>
<p>"Come!" The eyelids lifted higher: "The girls' group leans to the far left!"</p>
<p>A pile of more colorful leaves blew to stick to the × army carrying guns, stroking the hair of Chinese children, the "amiable East Asia."</p>
<p>"Everyone, clean yourselves up!" The principal frowned. Looking at the senior students in the back, who were vigorously patting their sleeves, stirring up smoke and dust, he waved his hand upward:</p>
<p>"Today, we must be especially neat. Boys wearing student caps, come out and form a line; those wearing blue cloth long gowns, also form a line. Girls wearing short skirts, form a line; those wearing cheongsams, form a line; those wearing velvet coats, form a line. Everyone, don't divide by grade, quickly line up."</p>
<p>The leaves danced in a whirlwind, flying around in confusion.</p>
<p>"　!" A female student cried because the wooden comb on her head was entangled in another female student's velvet coat, and her hair was pulled very painfully.</p>
<p>The Queen hurried to separate the comb and the velvet.</p>
<p>"After the line is formed, I have a few important words to say, everyone listen carefully!" The principal's eyelids, at this moment, only lifted the right one, the left one seemed to be slightly twitching. "Going out today is to welcome the brave and righteous × army, who have just returned from suppressing bandits in the countryside. When you see the brave and righteous × army, you must take off your hats and bow. Do you hear? Raise your hands if you hear!"</p>
<p>Wang Hua, a fifth-grader, touched the swollen, black-purple bruise on his face that had not yet faded, suddenly remembered the scene of a few days ago like a flash of lightning.</p>
<p>But the leaves all raised their hands. The hands of those lower-grade students were slanted, like the horizontal and vertical lines of young branches.</p>
<p>"When you see the brave and righteous × army, you must show a smile on your face, expressing friendliness, do you hear?"</p>
<p>The young branches of the leaves were again crooked and slanted.</p>
<p>Wang Hua bit his lip, and the wings of anger fluttered and trembled in his chest.</p>
<p>"When you see the teacher clap his hands, you must also clap your hands. Do you hear?"</p>
<p>Everyone raised their hands again, but this time it seemed that a student, hearing the words "clap hands," took it as a cue to actually clap once.</p>
<p>Wang clenched his fists tightly, like two drumsticks.</p>
<p>"Don't move!" The principal said sternly, turning his head and glancing with his twitching left eye to the side: "Mr. Zhang, bring out the flags!"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang and the others who were not Mr. Zhang all brought out bundles of flags and distributed them to the student ranks.</p>
<p>The kindergarten students found the colorful flags interesting and shook them vigorously. Li Dasheng, a third-grader, pointed to the word "shan" ("good") on the flag "× China Friendship" and asked the short-legged tiger Gu Rong. The short-legged tiger patted his big head and said, "Shan, sounds the same as 'ran' in infectious disease."</p>
<p>The female students in the senior grades were flattening the wrinkled corners of the flag.</p>
<p>The principal's eyes were still twitching, and this time he raised his voice: "Don't shake the flags!"</p>
<p>The flags stood quietly in the hands of the elementary school students.</p>
<p>"I don't want it!" Suddenly, Wang Hua's flag flew through the air with a "swish swish" sound, and then rested wearily next to the principal's black leather shoes.</p>
<p>"What?" The principal, unexpectedly provoked, opened his mouth.</p>
<p>"I don't want it, I'm not going! My father was shot by them, my sister was dragged away by them, the pain on my face hasn't healed yet, I haven't forgotten those bastards!" It was a string of explosive cannonballs.</p>
<p>"Oh, are you crazy?" The principal was embarrassed and had to say sternly again, "Mr. Zhang, drag him out!"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang and the others who were not Mr. Zhang carried out the order.</p>
<p>The purple swollen face, in a few arms, turned around like being scalded by boiling water, stubbornly standing under a pine tree outside the school gate.</p>
<p>The inky pupils of the leaves were like iron, attracted by the magnet under the pine tree.</p>
<p>"Everyone, ignore him," said the principal, and then shouted the command loudly, "Forward...dress! Attention!...At ease! Forward...march!" The veins on his forehead crawled like earthworms.</p>
<p>A string of leaves swept out under the broom.</p>
<p>"Sing the 'East Asia Alliance Song'!"</p>
<p>The ranks of leaves were immersed in the innocent singing.</p>
<p>At this time, Wang Hua, with fiery eyes, rushed into the ranks with iron-hammer fists, shouting, "Don't go!"</p>
<p>Everyone was stunned.</p>
<h3>Fog</h3>
<p>— Gao Xiaochong</p>
<p>The fog, white and vast, vaguely pervades, like thick water vapor. (Countless tiny water droplets covered the earth.) The ancient temple only protruded its corners, the bare trees only extended their branch tips, and the distant pagoda only revealed its top. The fog, white and vast, vaguely pervades.</p>
<p>One pair of feet, steady, then another pair came. One pair, one pair, a hurried line of people, only a few sharp stones were visible at the foot of the mountain. In front was white and vast, behind was white and vast, all around was white and vast, walking quickly. Looking up at the mountainside, one sees a piece of white, vaguely. Taking a shortcut, turning a bend, looking at the toes while walking. "Don't make noise, be careful, bend over." A password was passed to the whole team. Silently, dozens of burly men instantly turned into eighty-year-old men.</p>
<p>"Gun forward, crouch and advance." Eyes looking ahead, sometimes glancing left and right. Large stones, fine sand, withered grass, tree roots, the rugged road, left behind. "Scatter!" A few words were whispered. Encirclement! One hugs, one kills, resulting in the enemy's sentinel. Half a circle of red was revealed on the high ground, watching him advance.</p>
<p>Quietly, quietly, everyone had arrived. Hiding under big trees, lying next to big stones, and silently lying on the ground to move forward. Boom! Boom boom boom! Peng peng boom boom boom...! A hand grenade called out dozens of others. Excitement, hatred, appeared on the face of every man. Shouts of killing, gunshots, and hand grenade sounds were intertwined. The enemy, panicked, frightened, and embarrassed, wanted to escape. Where could they? Bullets, bayonets, and hand grenades were all around. Escaping, crawling, crying, shouting, one by one they ate bullets, bayonets, and hand grenades, blood flowing crisscross. A few were left, kneeling, kowtowing, raising their hands. Each was tied, prisoners.</p>
<p>Triumphant return, chests puffed out, necks stiffened, carrying guns, walking, striding. Singing loudly: "Fog! Today is fog, tomorrow is fog, the day after tomorrow is also fog! We hope every day is fog. Kill kill kill! So that we can kill them and leave none behind..."</p>
<h3>People and Heroes</h3>
<p>— Yang Yanqi</p>
<p>Are heroes people? Yes. But not everyone is a hero. It is precisely because not everyone is a hero that heroes have a value of worship.</p>
<p>However, today's heroes are buried too much. Although "fame" is not the goal of a hero, there is also a place in history, enough to draw golden lines on the blank history, shining with immense light, and eternally recorded. Eternal recording is not the limelight of the hero himself, but the idol of future generations. Christians worship the thoughts of Christ and Jesus as a person, aren't they all due to a Bible? Therefore, literature is the stone tablet of heroes, a stone tablet erected in the universe for heroes.</p>
<p>Therefore, literary workers seem unable to forget the mission of erecting monuments for heroes. Erecting a monument is not just writing an epitaph, but writing an article of any form. If there are heroes in literary works, they will have vitality, blood, and flesh. Otherwise, it is a dead art without life.</p>
<p>Today, the psychology of worshiping heroes is almost lower than worshiping beauties. Because heroes are not flavorful enough, afraid,不敢崇拜. And beauties, it is easy to write on paper and easy to fascinate people, anyway, no one will be serious; so, the craze of beauty worship is flourishing!</p>
<p>Maybe there is a reason, everyone dare not look up to heroes, only willing to bow their heads and stroke the hands of beauties. So, closing your eyes, so that you first do not see reality clearly, and then create a shell for yourself, wrap yourself inside, dreaming all day long, hoping to ascend to heaven and enjoy happiness in the dream. In fact, people are on the ground, and they will not ascend to heaven unless they die, not to mention whether they will ascend to heaven after death is still a question. Since you live on the ground, you have to live on the ground, and it is impossible to get rid of the reality of the ground; since you live in the present, you have to live in the present, and it is impossible to get rid of this great era. Impossible, impossible, a thousand impossibilities!</p>
<p>Therefore, the stone tablet of literature has a second use, like a mirror, it must have a reflecting function. To reflect the reality on this ground, to reflect the color of this great era. Otherwise, it is either a rotten bone of a dead person, or an empty dream. The rotten bone will soon rot more, rotten to nothing; when the empty dream comes to awakening, it will also drift away, not knowing where to go; like a puff of smoke, lighter than smoke, like a cloud, thinner than a cloud; everything is not a stone tablet, but colorful soap bubbles, beautiful, yes: just lacking a little life.</p>
<p>Ernst Toller said: "Art does not eliminate her effectiveness after arousing the emotions of the audience." She must leave traces in the world forever, because literature is fundamentally a trace; art is beautiful, but beauty must have the beauty of life. The face of a mummy will never smile for a lifetime, what else can you say?</p>
<p>Art wants to express heroes, yes; not everyone is a hero, I hope art will not be wasted. It doesn't matter if the author's energy is wasted, but it's really not worth wasting the reader's time. People, heroes, at least you have to make it a little clear.</p>

<h3>Amidst the Flames</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>These words made everyone slightly disappointed, but they all thought that Battalion Commander Ye was deliberately exaggerating to cause alarm, so they didn't take it seriously. Seeing that everyone was indifferent, Battalion Commander Ye couldn't help but secretly shake his head, took a sip of wine, and said:</p>
<p>"I'm not afraid of the enemy attacking. I can withstand one or two thousand men. What I fear are the traitors who act as accomplices for the enemy. To be honest, if China didn't have traitors, we would definitely eliminate the enemy faster."</p>
<p>Then they talked about the traitors again. Wu Yaqing said that he had seen many fake teams along the way that not only could not protect the people and resist the enemy, but also colluded with the enemy and harassed the people everywhere. He said with great emotion: "A good noun, when it comes to China, is often misused. Now even robbers and bandits can use high-sounding terms to disguise their atrocities."</p>
<p>"It is these people who are the most difficult to deal with!" Battalion Commander Ye sighed and said, "If we don't suppress them, it's really unconscionable to allow them to disturb the people. But if we suppress them, at this time, it is really heartbreaking for Chinese to fight Chinese. And if we push them too hard, it's hard to guarantee that they won't openly surrender to the enemy and become accomplices for the enemy, which would be an even greater disaster."</p>
<p>Everyone sighed in silence, but after all, it was none of their business, so they just talked about it and didn't take it to heart. As the banquet ended, they excused themselves and left. The New Year's Day military-civilian celebration was in full swing at the end of the market. The street play "Put Down Your Whip" had reached its finale, and the shouts from the stage and the audience merged into one. Battalion Commander Ye nodded and said:</p>
<p>"The morale of the people here is very useful, but it still needs to be deepened."</p>
<p>Battalion Adjutant Liang seemed to have some concerns and said to Battalion Commander Ye:</p>
<p>"In this kind of weather, enemy planes may not come. Even if they come, evacuation will still be possible. Everyone has worked hard enough on weekdays. It's a rare New Year's Day, so let's not spoil their fun."</p>
<p>Battalion Adjutant Liang said no more, and together with several other battalion commanders, followed Battalion Commander Ye back to the battalion headquarters. (21)</p>

<h3>Relieving Apprentices</h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Apprentices in Chinese shops and factories seem to be like little servants. When we walk into small shops or small factories, we often see twelve or thirteen-year-old servants wearing tattered clothes doing odd jobs. Those are apprentices.</p>
<p>Apprentices have to get up at five o'clock every morning and don't get to sleep until ten o'clock at night. They have no rest time and no holidays. If things are busy, they also have to work at night. If they do things wrong, they will be punished, such as standing, kneeling, slapping, hitting palms, and spanking. Such a life has to go through three or five years before it is considered completed. After completion, they can be called "partners" or "clerks" and can receive salaries. During the apprenticeship period, there is no salary.</p>
<p>We know that today's apprentices are the future managers and staff of shops and factories. Today's managers and staff of shops and factories are former apprentices. The underdevelopment of industry and commerce in our country is mostly due to the lack of economic common sense and business ethics among industrial and commercial managers and staff. Because what they learned during their apprenticeship was too superficial. If we want to revitalize industry and commerce, we must start with relieving apprentices in order to achieve results. Here are a few measures for fellow countrymen who care about industry and commerce to study and refer to.</p>
<p>1.  The government of our country should urgently formulate "Apprentice Regulations." At a minimum, the working hours of apprentices should be limited to eight hours per day, and at most no more than ten hours.</p>
<p>2.  The minimum age of apprentices should be fifteen years old or older.</p>
<p>3.  The work of apprentices should be within the scope of learning. Odd jobs such as cooking, washing clothes, carrying children, and emptying chamber pots should not be called upon apprentices to do.</p>
<p>4.  The term of apprenticeship should not exceed three years at most.</p>
<p>5.  In addition to providing food and lodging for apprentices, employers should provide living expenses, at least three yuan per month.</p>
<p>6.  Every morning and evening, employers should give apprentices the opportunity to study, such as attending night schools or tutoring schools. All tuition fees should be borne by the employer.</p>

<h3>A Strange Year of Yin and Yang</h3>
<p>— Hutu</p>
<p>The Gregorian calendar year has just passed not long ago, and the lunar year is approaching again. With less than two months between them, we have to celebrate two New Years, making people confused, which is really a bit strange with yin and yang.</p>
<p>Some say that the Gregorian calendar year is a foreign year, and the lunar year is a Chinese year. Those who like to imitate foreign ways naturally like to celebrate the Gregorian calendar year, while farmers like the lunar year because its solar terms are clear, with the vernal equinox and the grain rain. The Gregorian calendar is even clearer than the lunar calendar in terms of solar terms, and its calculation of months and years is more accurate and easier to remember. The government has long ordered the uniform adoption of the Gregorian calendar throughout the country, but most people still comply outwardly but defy inwardly. The result is that whether it is the Gregorian calendar year or the lunar calendar year, everyone celebrates them all, and the result is uncertainty about yin and yang, and delays in months and years. Isn't this a reason for being strange with yin and yang?</p>
<p>In fact, the Gregorian calendar year is very convenient, easy to remember, and easy to calculate. Unlike the lunar calendar year, the months are large and small, unpredictable, and the months before and after the intercalary month are unclear. Here is a song about the solar terms of the Gregorian calendar for reference:</p>
<p>The practical Gregorian calendar is very convenient,</p>
<p>All twenty-four solar terms are easy to calculate;</p>
<p>Each month has two terms on a fixed date,</p>
<p>At most differing by one or two days;</p>
<p>In the first half of the year, six, twenty-one,</p>
<p>In the second half of the year, eight, twenty-three;</p>
<p>If you memorize these few sentences,</p>
<p>You won't have to flip through the almanac again;</p>
<p>January has Minor Cold followed by Major Cold,</p>
<p>If planting early rice, you must plow the fields;</p>
<p>February has Start of Spring and Rain Water,</p>
<p>The wheat fields should be weeded;</p>
<p>March has Awakening of Insects and Vernal Equinox,</p>
<p>Rice fields should be plowed eight inches deep again;</p>
<p>April passes with Pure Brightness and Grain Rain,</p>
<p>Rape flowers bloom and wheat turns green;</p>
<p>May has Start of Summer and Grain Full,</p>
<p>Harvesting wheat and weeding should not be late;</p>
<p>June arrives with Grain in Ear and Summer Solstice,</p>
<p>It's hard to open your eyes in the plum rain;</p>
<p>July has Minor Heat followed by Major Heat,</p>
<p>Although the weather is hot, weeds must be hoed;</p>
<p>August has Start of Autumn and End of Heat,</p>
<p>The ears of early rice are already ripe in the fields;</p>
<p>September has White Dew and Autumnal Equinox,</p>
<p>After harvesting rice, the fields are plowed again;</p>
<p>October brings Cold Dew and Frost's Descent,</p>
<p>Only peanuts remain in the fields;</p>
<p>November has Start of Winter and Minor Snow,</p>
<p>Rice and wheat turn into money, joy and happiness;</p>
<p>Just wait for Major Snow and Winter Solstice to arrive,</p>
<p>And enjoy another spring with wine around the stove.</p>
<p>This song is indeed a good song. Once you memorize it, you no longer need to buy the "Old-Style New Almanac." But we still need to explain the meaning of this song.</p>
<p>Our earth revolves around the sun, taking 365 days, plus 5 hours, 48 minutes, 57 seconds, and 39 hundredths of a second, to complete a full revolution around the sun, which is called a year. The so-called spring, summer, autumn, and winter are the four seasons of the year, and these seasons are also determined according to the earth's rotation around the sun. For example, if the earth is a flat face, with the sun in the middle between the nose and the eyes, and the earth starts rotating from the mouth, the starting point is considered "Winter Solstice." Slowly rotating towards the upper left, it reaches the left ear, which is "Vernal Equinox." The time it takes to travel this distance is about ninety days. In a leap year, add one day. Then slowly rotate towards the top of the head, which is "Summer Solstice." The time it takes to travel this distance is about ninety-two days. Then rotate downwards, reaching the right ear, which is "Autumnal Equinox." The time it takes to travel this distance is about ninety-three days. Then rotate downwards, reaching the mouth, which is "Winter Solstice" again. The time it takes to travel this distance is about ninety days. Adding them all up, it is 365 days, 5 hours, 48 minutes, 57 seconds, and 39 hundredths of a second. If you ask why the length of each journey varies, the general answer is: because this face is flat, the distance from "Winter Solstice" to "Vernal Equinox" is the closest to the sun, so the number of days is the least; the distance from "Summer Solstice" to "Autumnal Equinox" is the farthest from the sun, so the number of days is the most.</p>
<p>For convenience, we treat 365 days as a year, and the odd numbers are added up every four years to make a day, which is added to the end of February. Since the method of circling is like this, and the weather, temperature, or day length of each part of the earth are different during the circling journey, this is formed by the relationship between the earth's rotation and the direct and oblique sunlight. Our China is located in the middle of the northern hemisphere of the earth. During the "Winter Solstice" period, sunlight directly shines on a line in the middle of the southern hemisphere of the earth (called the Tropic of Capricorn). Because the waist of the earth in our place (i.e., the equator) is much higher than the middle of the two hemispheres, people in this hemisphere naturally have some eye blockage when looking at the light from that hemisphere, so the time they meet is short, and the day is naturally short. The sunlight is also the same, and very little of the light is blocked and shot over, so the weather is cold, and the days are short and the nights are long. But as the earth keeps rotating, the sunlight slowly shines directly to the middle again, and the sunlight slowly becomes more and more abundant every day, so the days slowly become longer, and the climate slowly becomes warmer. When the sunlight shines directly onto the middle band of the earth (the equator), the amount of light is neither too much nor too little, and the temperature is just right. This is the period of the "Vernal Equinox." The weather is mild, and the day and night are the same length. But as the earth rotates, the sunlight slowly shines onto the northern hemisphere, and the weather here becomes warmer, and the days become longer. When the sun shines on top of our heads, the light is the most intense. This is the "Summer Solstice." The weather is hot, and the days are long and the nights are short. At this time, sunlight has been blocked by a big rope (the Tropic of Cancer) and can no longer move north. As the earth rotates, the sunlight slowly moves away from us, so the weather cools down and the time shortens. This is the "Autumnal Equinox." The weather and time are the same as during the "Vernal Equinox." Later, because the earth rotates towards the southern hemisphere, we feel cooler weather and shorter time here. When its direct rays are blocked by the rope in the south and no longer move, and directly shine on that rope, it is the "Winter Solstice." The weather is the coldest and shortest. Therefore, the earth rotates non-stop, forming the four seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter in a year.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these principles are not represented by diagrams, but if readers study carefully, they will know that the Gregorian calendar is indeed accurate and convenient, and more rational than calculating by the moon like the lunar calendar. Because the Gregorian calendar year, 365 days, differs from the number of days in the earth's revolution around the sun by less than six hours, and only differs by one day in four years. The lunar calendar has twelve full moons, with five or six small months inside. Calculating this way, a year of 355 or 6 days differs from the Gregorian calendar by about ten days. Gentlemen, just think about the high interest rates of farmers, the salaries of civil servants, and the rent of three-room tenants. How inconvenient is that?</p>
<p>Everyone understands the benefits of the Gregorian calendar and follows the Gregorian calendar rules. Then, over time, you won't need the old-style new almanac. However, the lunar New Year is coming. This naturally won't be strange with yin and yang, with delays in months and years, making people confused.</p>
<h3>A Woman in Distress</h3>
<p>— Feifei</p>
<p>On the way, I met a woman in distress, pleading with me sadly: Her eyes changed color as tears flowed, and her hands trembled. Her clothes were tattered and did not cover her body, and her limbs were skinny; she wanted to walk but could not move forward, and her steps were very weak. She spoke to me mumbling, saying that her background was not humble; she had servants at her command, and the signboard was hundreds of feet high, only because of the "August 13th" incident, the war suddenly started; flames came all over the place, her courage was shattered, and her heart was frightened. It was difficult to live safely in her hometown, and her old home became an empty house. Supporting the old and carrying the young, she only wanted to escape for her life. She wandered to other places, and the funds were all used up; her son died on the battlefield, and her husband died on the side of the road; one daughter was taken away, and there has been no news of her to this day; she returned to her home again, and the house became rubble. Hunger and cold tormented each other, and poverty and illness repeatedly struck; she had no full meal during the day, and she relied on the eaves for shelter at night. Where to go in the vastness, to whom to weep sadly? From then on, she wandered and became a wandering skeleton. Alas - Hearing her words, tears fell like rain, and anger surged in my heart without stopping. I call on tens of thousands of compatriots to unite and protect the country and the people to protect their homes. Compatriots, wake up quickly and don't be cattle and horses for others!</p>

<h3>Celebrating the New Year</h3>
<p>— Wang Xiaoer</p>
<p>Drums and gongs beat eighteen times,</p>
<p>The twelfth lunar month arrives again on the twenty-second or third;</p>
<p>I, Xiaoer, don't know how others celebrate the New Year,</p>
<p>Xiaoer can talk to you about how I celebrate the New Year.</p>
<p>Since the cold winter twelfth lunar month has arrived,</p>
<p>Every household is busy celebrating the New Year;</p>
<p>Some offer chicken and fish to their ancestors,</p>
<p>Some gather around the stove to eat New Year's Eve dinner;</p>
<p>Some burn incense and worship the Bodhisattva,</p>
<p>Some carry gifts to give away;</p>
<p>It's just the twenty-third,</p>
<p>Preparing to send off the Kitchen God diligently;</p>
<p>Preparing a sedan chair and horses is not enough,</p>
<p>You also have to buy candy for offerings;</p>
<p>Just because the Kitchen God goes to the upper world,</p>
<p>To tell the Jade Emperor about good and evil;</p>
<p>It's better to buy candy to stick the Kitchen God's mouth shut,</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "If you eat someone's things, your mouth will be soft."</p>
<p>I hope he says good things to heaven,</p>
<p>And ask for peace in the lower world;</p>
<p>This natural custom has been inherited to the present,</p>
<p>But it is also necessary to celebrate the New Year in this way.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoer doesn't believe in Taoism at all,</p>
<p>Therefore, I don't hold any ceremonies.</p>
<p>(White) Everyone, sending off the Kitchen God and giving gifts is also a matter of human nature. It's the usual practice every year, but now disasters are everywhere, and people are struggling to make a living. How can we bear to gather around the stove for a small drink? Why bother sending off and welcoming? And why bother worshiping gods and ghosts? Confucius said, "If you cannot serve people, how can you serve ghosts?" If you have spare money, go to relieve the refugees or contribute to the country, that is necessary. If you must buy candy to send off the Kitchen God and ask for kind words about good and evil, why bother? To be honest, if the current Kitchen God is really psychic, he will see that you "have fat meat in the kitchen, and starving corpses in the fields," and he will definitely report to the Jade Emperor that you are unkind and unjust and that you eat humans like beasts. He will never keep silent because of a piece of candy. Therefore, I say that everything should be done for the peace of mind. Are there really gods and ghosts? If you think again and again, you will know that what I say is correct.</p>
<p>New Year decorations are really fresh and beautiful,</p>
<p>There are many shops on the street;</p>
<p>New Year paintings are displayed here,</p>
<p>Spring couplets are being written there;</p>
<p>There are also stories about the White Snake,</p>
<p>And Tang Monk going to the Western Paradise;</p>
<p>There is also a list of immortals who were deified,</p>
<p>And Lu Bu flirting with Diao Chan;</p>
<p>Xiaoer doesn't like any of these,</p>
<p>I only buy Gou Jian who slept on firewood and tasted gall;</p>
<p>Jing Ke assassinated Qin was truly loyal and brave,</p>
<p>Xue Pinggui joined the army and bid farewell to his kiln;</p>
<p>These are all patriotic heroes,</p>
<p>Whose beautiful names have been passed down to this day;</p>
<p>I'm happy after buying the New Year paintings,</p>
<p>Then I go to the other side to choose spring couplets;</p>
<p>There are those that say "Promote a New Atmosphere,"</p>
<p>And those that say "Restore the Old Mountains and Rivers."</p>
<p>There are also "National Sovereignty and Independence,"</p>
<p>Paired with "The Republic of China for Ten Thousand Years."</p>
<p>"Pay attention to fire safety" is written in the kitchen,</p>
<p>"Be careful to save water and electricity" is pasted on the wall;</p>
<p>All of these are maxims,</p>
<p>But they are just taken as mottoes.</p>
<p>(White) The meaning of spring couplets and New Year paintings must be alerting and thought-provoking. Unfortunately, what is sold outside is stupid and vulgar, either a family reunion of gods and immortals, or a harmonious atmosphere of gathering treasures and making a fortune, which makes people feel useless after seeing it. Although I, Xiaoer, am a rough person, I don't like it either. My meaning is to seek practicality above all else. It would be even better if it had some educational nature! The day before New Year's Eve is even busier,</p>
<p>Preparing to celebrate the New Year;</p>
<p>Settling accounts, dividing bonuses,</p>
<p>Worshiping ghosts and gods and offering gifts;</p>
<p>Sending off the old and welcoming the new, staying up all night,</p>
<p>The sound of gongs and drums is loud, with joy and laughter;</p>
<p>Incense and flowers are placed in front of the hall,</p>
<p>The portrait of the God of Wealth is hung in the middle;</p>
<p>A pair of red candles is placed on the left and right,</p>
<p>There are also bowls and plates;</p>
<p>Paper ingots are gradually burned in the furnace,</p>
<p>Incense smoke curls in front of the gods;</p>
<p>Kowtowing a few times and praying,</p>
<p>"God of Wealth, please be convenient";</p>
<p>Words of good luck and prosperity are spoken,</p>
<p>There is an endless supply of surplus silver and wealth;</p>
<p>Congratulating the New Year for wealth and honor,</p>
<p>Children compete to add New Year's money;</p>
<p>The sound of firecrackers echoes far and near,</p>
<p>Intermittently like bombs;</p>
<p>Even in the great war, people are quiet,</p>
<p>Just like the "August 13th" incident of that year.</p>
<p>Xiaoer didn't see this situation and it was still okay,</p>
<p>But after seeing it, I feel heartbroken;</p>
<p>Our China is facing a national crisis and disaster,</p>
<p>Thanks to the leader for solving the crisis;</p>
<p>All good sons and daughters of China,</p>
<p>Would never stand by and do nothing;</p>
<p>Enduring humiliation and living is certainly not right,</p>
<p>Let alone celebrating the New Year happily;</p>
<p>In this year, many people cannot return home,</p>
<p>Many couples are not reunited;</p>
<p>Many people don't have three meals a day,</p>
<p>Many chimneys don't smoke;</p>
<p>Many people have nowhere to sell their blood and sweat,</p>
<p>Many people shed blood and sweat but have no rice and salt;</p>
<p>Many people starve to death on the roadside without the strength to bury them,</p>
<p>Many people sleep on the streets enduring hunger and cold;</p>
<p>Displacement is everywhere,</p>
<p>Do you think it's miserable or not?</p>
<p>I am celebrating the New Year happily now,</p>
<p>But it's not thoughtful at all;</p>
<p>This is exactly the uneven distribution of wealth and poverty,</p>
<p>Truly what is called "a divided plate of loose sand";</p>
<p>The more Xiaoer thinks about it, the more uncomfortable I feel,</p>
<p>Alas! It's even more unbearable in the midst of difficulty.</p>
<p>(White) Speaking of the New Year, it is really lively and extraordinary, with ten thousand families happy, singing and dancing in peace. Needless to say, the game fields are crowded with people, and on the road, you can only see brand new clothes and hats. This prosperity is really remarkable. It's just that many people who have been displaced and lost due to the war, like homeless dogs, cannot be equally happy, which is regrettable. That's why Xiaoer is unhappy this year. I neither worship gods nor perform rituals, and I have no money to help others. I really have no intention of seeking happiness. I just sit silently in the attic, teaching my younger brother to read. However, from time to time, I hear the sound of firecrackers, and my nerves are sensitive for a while, and I am a little frightened for some reason.</p>
<p>The road is very extraordinary,</p>
<p>There are women and men;</p>
<p>Men are dressed in new clothes like "A Fu,"</p>
<p>Women are powdered like mud Bodhisattvas;</p>
<p>Let's not talk about these things,</p>
<p>Just talk about one thing that is customary;</p>
<p>Dominoes and dice are in every household,</p>
<p>Some also play a few rounds of mahjong;</p>
<p>Regardless of day and night,</p>
<p>Regardless of early or late;</p>
<p>Gambling for money,</p>
<p>They are really buried in their work and work hard;</p>
<p>It's really uninteresting to waste your energy,</p>
<p>Your head is dizzy, your brain is dull, and your back is sore;</p>
<p>It's not easy to work hard for a year,</p>
<p>They gamble it away for three days and two nights;</p>
<p>The more they lose, the more they don't let go,</p>
<p>How will they pay off their gambling debts;</p>
<p>Some good friends turn against each other,</p>
<p>Some good brothers smash the table;</p>
<p>Some seek death in desperation after losing,</p>
<p>Some hang themselves and swallow opium;</p>
<p>Adults gamble, and children watch,</p>
<p>What about family education;</p>
<p>They learn bad habits from a young age,</p>
<p>It's hard to change when they grow up,</p>
<p>Gentlemen, listen to me,</p>
<p>Don't gamble anymore;</p>
<p>Xiaoer has many feelings in my heart,</p>
<p>But I can't finish saying it all because I'm not talented;</p>
<p>I'll write down this passage for now,</p>
<p>And submit it to the "Masses Weekly."</p>

<h3>Getting Rich</h3>
<p>— Difficult Reporter</p>
<p>When meeting in the New Year, everyone clasps their hands, bows, and says, "Congratulations on getting rich!"</p>
<p>Everyone likes to accumulate wealth; But whether it is others' wishes or one's own hope, they don't say: "Congratulations on accumulating wealth," nor do they say: "Congratulations on accumulating wealth," but they just say: "Congratulations on getting rich."</p>
<p>"Getting Rich" means distributing; disseminating; releasing. It can be seen that if a person wants to "get rich", he must first "distribute" wealth; be willing to "distribute" wealth in order to "get rich".</p>
<p>To use a common saying, it's called "go out in the open, come in secret"; to use a literary saying, it's called "small goings and big comings"; Now, helping refugees is a "getting rich" opportunity and also a "getting rich" path. I hope every Shanghai person doesn't miss it!</p>
<p>Slice of Life</p>
<h3>The Life of an Apprentice</h3>
<p>— Chen Junsheng</p>
<p>"Oyo, Mom!"</p>
<p>This low, deep, painful groan is what I, who have been in the store for less than two months, inevitably say every night when lying in bed. Then I think of my hometown under artillery fire and the face of my kind mother. The hair on her head was already gray when I left, and now it must be even more haggard. I came to Shanghai from my hometown last April to learn a trade. Through a friend's introduction, I am apprenticed in a Tianjin restaurant. In addition to the master and mistress, there is also a younger apprentice in the store. He is only four years old this year, and there are two older chefs and me, a total of six people. I get up at four o'clock in the morning to carry the door panels, sweep the floor, and start the stove, and all sorts of chores. When I have free time, I take the younger apprentice for a walk. It's still okay. After half a month, the master asked me to take steamed buns and sell them in the nearby area. "Do you want some, hot steamed buns!" Places like teahouses, hotels, bathhouses, used goods stalls, and vegetable markets, rain or shine. If I sell a few less, I will be scolded by the master and beaten by the mistress. The mistress has a small temper and is fierce. When she is happy, if I sell a few less steamed buns, she will roll her eyes at you a few times. When she is unhappy (or loses money playing mahjong), ah, that's terrible. I will have to taste the weapon in her old lady's hand. The only weapon to beat me is an iron poker for the stove. That iron poker is thick and hard. If it hits the body, it will immediately leave a bruise that won't heal for three to five days. Therefore, every night I caress the scars on my body and even cry about the depravity of my fate. Ah Sheng, what are you doing? You little ghost, are you trying to die again! These words are almost my daily routine. Ah, who will pity my life? Indeed, besides my mother, who else is there? But I will never be so weak and decadent. I must struggle out of my bright and free path in a difficult environment.</p>
<h3>Weekly War Report</h3>
<p>Guangzhou and Qiongdao</p>
<p>On the Guangzhou-Kowloon, Yuehan, and Guangzhou-Sanshui Railways, there were no major changes this past week. However, at Dongguan and Taiping, Japanese troops, with combined infantry and artillery, attacked the Chinese army's Xian'an positions. Another unit landed at Nantou, coordinating with the Japanese forces at Dongguan and Taiping. The Chinese defenders fought bravely, but due to a significant disparity in numbers, their positions shifted slightly. Later, reinforcements of the Chinese army arrived, and Bao'an was retaken, forcing the Japanese to retreat to the Humen area. On Hainan Island, the Japanese forces at Haikou, Qiongshan, and Chengmai faced a large-scale counter-offensive by the Chinese united forces, causing considerable difficulty for the Japanese. Suffering losses, the Japanese engaged in widespread arson and murder in the area. They are currently striving to advance, but aiming for a quick victory, additional Japanese troops landed at Sanya Bay in the island's south, advancing towards Yulin to create a diversion. The Chinese side is prepared, constructing fortifications and engaging in steadfast defense. (Note: The sudden Japanese attack on Hainan Island is intended to intensify the war in South China, block international arms supplies, and accelerate the occupation of Guangdong and Guangxi. Another purpose is to threaten Britain and France, as the occupation of Qiongdao would put Hong Kong and Indochina in a precarious situation. Therefore, Britain and France are now seeking to unite against Japan, but no concrete action has yet been taken.)</p>
<p>Shanxi Province</p>
<p>Since the Chinese army in southern Shanxi inflicted a defeat on the Japanese south of Zhongtiao Mountain, there have been intense battles in areas north of the mountain, including Jiexian, Anyi, Wenxi, and Tiao County. Recently, the Chinese army has occupied northwest Jiexian, and the Chinese army has also retaken strongholds in Anyi and Wenxi. Unwilling to accept defeat, the Japanese have released large amounts of tear gas in an attempt to gain an advantage. A stalemate continues. In eastern Shanxi, the Chinese army is besieging Heshun.</p>
<p>Hunan and Hubei Provinces</p>
<p>The front lines in northern and central Hubei are quiet. However, at Jinniu Town in southern Hubei, the Japanese forces were subjected to a large-scale attack by the Chinese army. Due to the intense Chinese artillery fire, the Japanese seemed to have suffered losses. Later, in an attempt to break the siege, the Japanese released large amounts of poison gas in a desperate resistance. Unexpectedly, the wind direction suddenly changed, turning to their disadvantage. Seeing an opportunity, the Chinese army advanced bravely and was able to recapture Jinniu. In addition, the important locations of Jinkou and Huanglingji southwest of Wuchang were successively retaken. In this campaign, the Chinese guerrillas were able to control traffic and launch surprise attacks, achieving remarkable success.</p>
<p>Other Areas</p>
<p>At Fanchang in southern Anhui, the Japanese army engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army. It is reported that Commander Nagasawa's unit also suffered heavy damage. In addition, 3,000 troops of the puppet army under Zhou Xuanchen in Xuzhou, over 2,000 troops of the puppet army under Liu Hushen in northern Sui, and 3,000 troops under Yu Zhiqian have all defected and returned to the Nationalist side. Furthermore, the Chinese air force has been quite active in recent days, reportedly shooting down as many as nine Japanese planes in the Lanzhou area.</p>
<h3>One Aspect of New Year's Life</h3>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Production, Education, and Sales Group</h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>Fifty male and female members - Excellent results after one year of establishment</p>
<p>Recently, the problem of providing relief to the tens of thousands of refugees in Shanghai has become increasingly difficult. Those in charge have realized that it is better to provide refugees with production education, enabling them to support themselves, than to have them sit idle and rely on charity for a long time. Therefore, the slogan of promoting refugee production education is being loudly proclaimed. At the same time, this reminds me of the Production, Education, and Sales Group run by the YMCA in the Eight Immortals Bridge area, which has been in existence for a full year and has achieved excellent results, serving as a model for those concerned about refugee production education.</p>
<p>After the war moved away from Shanghai, the YMCA launched a Production, Education, and Sales Group with the aim of providing relief to young men and women who lost their jobs and were unable to make a living during the war. It recruited 50 members, providing them with education while enabling them to produce goods and support themselves. After the news spread, many people applied, and the group soon reached its full quota, with a portion of the members being women. After a considerable period of training, the male and female members began their sales work.</p>
<p>The goods sold by the members were all products from domestic factories, which the YMCA had arranged beforehand on a consignment basis. That is, the members would return the cost of the goods after they were sold and receive a commission. Every day, the 50 male and female members carried heavy leather briefcases and rattan bags full of goods, rushing around to earn a living. In the summer, they were drenched in sweat under the scorching sun, and in the winter, they were blown by the bitter wind until their noses ran. Their spirit of hard work and endurance evoked sympathy from those who witnessed it.</p>
<p>They, or she, went to residential areas. Standing in front of people's doors, they smilingly asked you to buy their goods. Their humble attitude and courteous manner made people admire them. After the goods were displayed, they didn't complain even if you didn't buy anything. They would even further explain that the goods they carried were all products from first-class domestic factories, and the prices were exactly the same as those in the stores outside. Buying their goods would not only save you money and time, avoiding the need to go outside, but also provide relief and help to them, which is equivalent to doing a good deed, wouldn't it be killing two birds with one stone? As a result, people were persuaded to buy their goods even if they didn't want to.</p>
<p>Regardless of gender, their clothing was very simple. No matter how many miles they had to walk each day, they always walked, without taking a car. The goods they sold were mostly everyday household items, while the female members carried more cosmetics and women's products. After running around all day, they could make about ten yuan in business if they were lucky. After deducting a 10% commission, they could earn about one yuan in income, so they could earn more than ten to twenty yuan a month. As for their living arrangements, they usually rented a room with several other people, and some cooked their own meals while others bought food to eat. Their lives were thoroughly proletarian, so what they earned through their labor was barely enough to get by.</p>
<p>This Production, Education, and Sales Group has been in existence for a year. In the past year, 50 unemployed men and women have been able to find work and support themselves, which is of course thanks to the organizers of the YMCA. This kind of relief for refugees is certainly much better than simply raising donations from all sectors and having the refugees sit idle. It's just that the YMCA's Production, Education, and Sales Group is limited to only 50 members, which is too few to allow the majority of unemployed refugees to have goods to sell and support themselves. And since no other organizations have followed the YMCA's example in running similar sales groups, it makes us feel that it is insufficient.</p>
<h3>If I Were King</h3>
<p>— Yan Hua</p>
<p>"If I Were King"</p>
<p>Paramount Production, Grand Light Theatre</p>
<p>I haven't read the history of François Villon, and I don't know the true story of this great 15th-century French poet, but I feel that this film, through modern thinking and criticism, has become a strong modern fighter who leads the people to defend their country.</p>
<p>At least, this kind of historical costume film has its accurate and clear revelation, that is, don't underestimate the power of the people, they are the most loyal and brave warriors of the country. No matter in what kind of political system, the military force of the people cannot be underestimated. An autocratic and tyrannical government will inevitably collapse, and a government that is deeply supported by the people must be a government of the people. This was true in the past, and it is certainly true now. When fascist countries are now coercing their people to engage in aggressive warfare, we can resolutely predict that these aggressive groups of countries will one day be overthrown. And what is the main driving force behind the overthrow of their governments? Needless to say, it is still the people!</p>
<p>"If I Were King" is still full of heroes, beauties, and romantic sentiments, but it gives us a great lesson. The whole story is about 15th-century Paris, France, which was surrounded by the Burgundians. At that time, the generals under King Louis XI of France were unwilling to fight, but Villon, a great French poet who grew up in the slums of Paris, led the people of the whole city to fight the Burgundians, and finally defeated and drove back the Burgundians. However, because the generals of the court were jealous of him, the poet, who had retired after his success, quietly left Paris.</p>
<p>Throughout the story, there are many things that are worth learning: King Louis XI was indeed surprised that Villon could use the people. For example, Louis himself often tried the people and hanged them, while Villon not only did not hang them, but gave them gold coins, which could not but surprise and admire Louis; After Villon defeated the Burgundians, King Louis did not reuse him, but said to him: "You should leave quickly, as long as you are here, I will not have peace for a day"! From this, it can be seen that Louis XI still did not value the military force of the people; Because of the昏庸 of successive French kings Louis, it naturally created a historical consequence that could not be violated, that is, the famous French Revolution in later history. The main driving force of this revolution, as mentioned earlier, was still the people!</p>
<p>As for the performance, under the magnificent power of the great director Frank Lloyd, he showed three characteristics in the presentation of the whole play: The cartoonization of the characters: Here, he made several main characters of the whole play humorous, such as Villon's light and agile, his escape and teasing of the Imperial Guard, making the audience feel a kind of chic and witty liking for Villon; Secondly, the character of King Louis XI washed away the heavy and solemn feeling of ordinary emperors, and in various postures, such as the sharp laughter, the twitching of the corners of the mouth, and the trembling of the walking posture, he wrote King Louis into a rather funny weirdo; The richness of the emotional atmosphere: such as when Villon was drinking and cheering wildly with the crowd in the slums, the Imperial Guard suddenly followed and provoked a fight; When fighting the Burgundians, the girl Hu Jie in the slums was injured and died. In a sad and tragic atmosphere, Villon carried her to the church, and when he kissed her trembling lips, she died; The strength of the capture of the crowd scene: Villon distributed all the food in the king's treasury to the people, and they cheered; Villon led the people to attack the Burgundians, and the war scene was lively and exciting; These can be said to be the most brilliant features of the whole film.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think, "If I Were King" is still a more powerful masterpiece among the foreign films shown during the Spring Festival.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Ronald Colman, who played the great French poet Villon, showed his chic, witty, and witty side very well, but in terms of being handsome and brave, Colman was not strong enough due to his physique; Basil Rathbone, who played King Louis XI, has always played tough roles. Here, his whole tone and walking posture have completely changed. Those who are used to watching his plays ("The Iron Duke" and "Robin Hood", etc., he played very important roles) will definitely be interested in the role he plays now; Frances Dee played Princess Katherine, the play is not much, but it is very warm and gentle, she is an actress who can act.</p>
<h3>Willing to Die Eating Pufferfish</h3>
<p>— Mo Dian</p>
<p>We have a saying that goes, "Willing to die eating pufferfish"; however, news of pufferfish poisoning is still often seen. It is said that pufferfish has a rich, delicious, and fresh taste, but if it is not cooked carefully, it can cause poisoning. There was a teahouse in Shanghai that used "specially hired experts to cook pufferfish" as one of its featured foods, but in the end, not many people ate it; and now this teahouse has also been converted into a theater.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I found a news item in the evening paper about a family poisoned by eating pufferfish. Are these people really gambling with their lives and appetites? They would never be so foolish. The reason why news of pufferfish poisoning is repeatedly seen is because of "greed". They clearly know that eating pufferfish is life-threatening, but when delicious food is in front of them, they can't help but move their index fingers. When they pick up their chopsticks and wolf down the food, they have long put their lives out of their minds. If they are lucky enough not to die, they will raise their thumbs and show that they have the courage to "willing to die eating pufferfish". Otherwise, when they are on their deathbeds, they will also make fun of themselves so as not to die as "hungry ghosts".</p>
<p>Now our "friendly country" is also acting as a "hero" by eating pufferfish. At first, they really felt it was delicious and raised their thumbs to boast about themselves, but the pufferfish in their stomachs eventually acted up. Once it acts up, even if there are skilled doctors, they will only pour soapy water to do their best. Their fate is only a matter of time.</p>
<h3>Automobile Permit No. 1 and Driver No. 1</h3>
<p>— Wan Erbei</p>
<p>Everyone knows that cars driving on Shanghai roads must have a "permit". The most recently issued car "permits" must have numbers exceeding 10,000, which shows that there are at least 10,000 cars in Shanghai, including private cars and taxis, as well as private transport vehicles and rental transport vehicles. The difference between private cars and taxis can be seen on the "permit": the former is black background with white characters, and the latter is white background with black characters. As for transport vehicles, the difference is that private vehicles are also black background with white characters, while rental vehicles are yellow background with white characters.</p>
<p>Every day we see car numbers on the road that are ten, hundred, thousand, or ten thousand, but we have never seen a car with permit No. 1. So, does permit No. 1 exist? Yes! It is said that the owner of permit No. 1 is surnamed Zhou. This permit No. 1 was issued as early as the early years of the Republic of China, which shows that the Zhou family was very wealthy back then. Of course, there is only one original permit No. 1, and there will never be a second one, so it is very precious, and its owner also regards it as a rarity, thinking it is very prestigious. However, the car with permit No. 1 is already an "old-timer car", so it has been kept in the garage and never comes out. The owner of this "old-timer car" has never stopped paying the monthly fees in order to keep permit No. 1; otherwise, the Car Management Office would revoke this permit No. 1.</p>
<p>Not just anyone can drive a car. Car drivers all have a driver's license, and this driver's license must be obtained after passing two rigorous examinations. Driver's licenses have now been issued up to more than 20,000. It is said that the nickname of the person who obtained driver's license No. 1 is Xiaomeilang, but his name is unknown. Xiaomeilang passed away a long time ago. During his lifetime, he drove a car for the Jewish tycoon Silas Aaron Hardoon. At that time, there was also a story related to car permit No. 1.</p>
<p>Because Hardoon only had driver No. 1 and no car No. 1, he once asked someone to negotiate with the Zhou family, willing to pay a large sum of money to buy their car permit No. 1. The Zhou family answered humorously: "Hardoon wants car permit No. 1 because he has driver No. 1, and he is prepared to have two No. 1s; and we have car permit No. 1, since Hardoon has driver No. 1, then we would rather pay a special wage to hire a driver No. 1!..." As a result, of course, Hardoon regretted being underground in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Making ideas on car permits is also a common phenomenon, such as the same number of digits or consecutive numbers, which is probably what is called "decorative beauty", right? At the same time, there are indeed some people who use sitting in a car as "decorative beauty", but in reality, they are "empty big officials".</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Tracing Past Events, Le Tian Transmits Wonderful Words; Establishing New Friendship, Scenic Spot Makes a Pure Excursion</p>
<p>Zhu Airen said, "Is it far? That doesn't matter. I have my own car here. I'll take you back to school later, so you can rest assured. Where do you want to go?" Wu Junsu said, "I've heard that many people have been going to Stone Lake for sightseeing these past few days. Have you been there?" Zhu Airen frowned and said, "Oh dear! My Miss Wu! Professor Wu! I'm so busy with the hospital, where would I find the time to go sightseeing at Stone Lake? All day long, all I see are the faces of patients, and all I hear are the voices of patients. Today, I took a leave of absence to pick up the two sisters. It's truly 'stealing half a day of leisure from a busy life.' Please guide us to go sightseeing. Stone Lake is fine. But is there a place to eat there?" Wu Junsu said, "Why wouldn't there be? There's everything there now." The four of them left the train station. Zhu Airen went to the parking area, found the car, and headed towards Stone Lake. During this time, Zhu Airen was an experienced driver because she was a doctor and often went out to see patients. Sometimes, when there was an emergency, she had to drive fast. The two He sisters could also drive, but they weren't very skilled because their family was used to using chauffeurs, and chauffeurs always drove. Only Wu Junsu absolutely could not drive. She put it well, saying, "I don't have a car yet. When I have a car, it won't be too late to learn to drive." Wu Junsu also had one shortcoming, which was nearsightedness. Although she wore glasses, she was still at a disadvantage. There are two types of nearsightedness, one is congenital and the other is acquired. Congenital nearsightedness is hereditary, like Wu Junsu's nearsightedness, which is congenital because her father was also nearsighted. Acquired nearsightedness is when the parents are not nearsighted, but the children suddenly become nearsighted. This may be due to other reasons. Recently, because many people in Jiangnan are nearsighted, this issue has also aroused discussion in the medical community, and they are eager to find a way to correct it. Let's say that although Wu Junsu doesn't have a car, she doesn't feel inconvenienced. Because in urban areas, there are public buses everywhere. If you want a specially hired car, there are also many car rental companies, and the prices are very cheap. On average, it only costs half a dollar every 20 minutes, and there are no tips, which is much cheaper than before the war. Not to mention Shanghai, a densely populated place, but even in Suzhou, various public buses, long-distance buses, and small cars shuttle back and forth like shuttles. There is also a public bus from the train station to You Lake, but the public bus stops at every stop, which is relatively slow. (47)</p>

<h3>Prospects for Traditional Opera (1)</h3>
<p>— Yu Tang</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Tang is a famous critic of opera. He recently wrote this article specially for this magazine to fully discuss the improvement of traditional opera, with high-level arguments, which is a rare masterpiece. The full text is about 4,000 words and will be published in installments for readers. (Editor)</p>
<p>Recently, I have heard people wanting to improve traditional opera, and even some people respecting a certain female performer as an advanced female performer. A few years ago, I would have been happy to join in the fun, but now I dare not blindly agree, because I have a new understanding of the future status of traditional opera.</p>
<p>Mr. Liao advocated in this magazine to regard Peking Opera and Kun Opera as national operas. Six or seven years ago, I also drafted an article with the same opinion and shouted loudly; at that time, I analyzed from the traditional opera itself the several immortal qualities it possessed, and then compared it with spoken drama, film, and other new local dramas, judging the greatness of traditional opera and predicting its immortality. In order to increase the status of traditional opera, I also gathered several like-minded comrades who were enthusiastic about studying traditional opera to discuss how to improve the declining traditional opera: from the actors' physique, knowledge, personality, clothing review, script awareness, rhetoric, to the improvement of musical instruments, the configuration of lights, the construction of the stage, etc., all were used as research objects, and after being smug for a while, in the end, because of lack of perseverance and economy, nothing was achieved. In recent years, I don't know whether it is because of a thorough understanding of traditional opera or because of backward thinking, I suddenly began to greatly doubt the future of traditional opera, which I had always thought was bright and brilliant, and I felt that the previous efforts were too incomplete. After several painful thoughts, I got a new theory and calculated the future fate of traditional opera; this is not to say that traditional opera will disappear from now on, but to say that traditional opera will eventually lose its past glory due to its inability to resist the impact of the torrent of the times.</p>
<p>Traditional opera itself is an epoch-making art, which no one can deny; but any art must have a close relationship with real life before it can have a large audience. With a large audience, it can be promoted and immortalized. Conversely, an art that loses its connection with life loses its audience; without an audience, it cannot avoid the fate of decline. To put it nicely, it is something that is locked in an ivory tower, which cannot be accepted by people on the street. For example, writing is to convey thoughts, which originally has a great relationship with life; later, someone wrote a good hand and was called a calligrapher, and he had an audience. Now, someone is famous for writing oracle bone inscriptions and stone drum inscriptions, but there are naturally very few appreciators, because it is not connected with real life. Traditional opera is a product of the times, and its consciousness and technology are adapted to the feudal society of old China. After many local refinements, removing the dross and preserving the essence, it created a special and glorious position. But now times are different, and people's thinking patterns have undergone great changes. The rise of movies and spoken dramas has quickly snatched away a large part of its audience. If Peking Opera did not rely on its own popularity to cater to the general public, it would have disappeared along with Kun Opera.</p>
<h3>Chaplin's Talking Problem</h3>
<p>— Idiot</p>
<p>Hollywood's Wild Speculation and Numerous Rumors</p>
<p>Not long ago, news came from Hollywood that the comedian Chaplin, in retaliation for Germany's ban on his humorous works, was preparing to shoot a film called "The Dictator." Chaplin is against sound films. It has been ten years since sound films became popular and replaced silent films. However, during these ten years, Chaplin has never spoken on the screen, nor has he directed a sound film. However, his new film "The Dictator" is a sound film, and he will also speak on the screen. Thus, how Chaplin will speak on the screen has become a problem, and it is a great source of conversation in the film city of Hollywood.</p>
<p>What does Chaplin's voice sound like in the microphone now? This question has been resolved, because he has broadcast on the radio several times. So, the mystery is how he will speak on the screen? If Chaplin changes his past prejudice of remaining silent on the screen, and his future new film is a sound film, what kind of dialogue will he adopt, and will he show his past smile in his debut sound film? That is another question.</p>
<p>According to Al Reeves, who is close to Chaplin: "Chaplin will shoot at least three sound films in the future, but this is all accidental, and it may be abandoned after the plan is finalized. When Chaplin first speaks on the screen, the words he says will all be monosyllabic." Al Reeves is Chaplin's business manager, so he naturally knows more about Chaplin than people do. In the past, Hollywood has repeatedly reported that Chaplin planned to shoot sound films, but Reeves always said it was untrue. Afterwards, people really knew that Chaplin did not have such a plan.</p>
<p>In the past, Chaplin often discussed sound film issues with his friends. Some of his friends believed that Chaplin would permanently remain a silent mime star, but others believed that for the sake of his career, he would slowly enter the realm of sound films. However, any speculation is castles in the air. It will not be confirmed until the last minute when Chaplin's sound film starts shooting or is officially released. Therefore, although the news that Chaplin is filming "The Dictator" has spread from the film city, whether it is a sound film and whether Chaplin himself will speak, everything will have to wait until the premiere to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Chaplin only has one photography studio in Hollywood. Painters and carpenters are busy working there. When each film is being shot, the photography studio is always silent and very quiet, unlike other photography studios where sound is constantly coming out when shooting sound films. Chaplin himself is very busy planning or directing every shot. If he also wants to be in the shot, his assistant Cade Heaven will take over the directing work. After a scene is shot, Chaplin sits alone in a canvas chair, with his hands behind his head. No one talks to him, and even reporters dare not approach him? Because this is when he is thinking, and no one can interrupt his train of thought. Every break between shots is like this, and the photography studio is always silent. But if he really wants to shoot a sound film, then this kind of calm atmosphere may have to change.</p>
<h3>Shaw's Humor</h3>
<p>— Considering an Award as an Insult</p>
<p>(Associated Press, London, 24th) Today, Shaw declared in his usual tone: "Hollywood's promotion of his Pygmalion as the best screenplay of the year and the awarding of a medal to him is a great insult to him." Shaw said: "Their giving me a medal is a great insult to me. Why don't they also give King George VI a medal, because George is the only emperor in Britain at the moment." (Note: Pygmalion was the king of Cyprus, who was in love with a stone statue.)</p>
<h3>Zhu Yanan Will Return to the Stage</h3>
<p>— Liu Zhenghu</p>
<p>May Go to Ping to Join a Troupe in Late Spring, Otherwise Will Reappear in Shanghai</p>
<p>Ms. Zhu Yanan, a famous female dan, went to sea from amateur status ten years ago and became famous in Shanghai and Wuhan. She was very popular for a while. Later, after the death of Zhu Naigeng (a famous amateur), she gave up her singing career and lived a hard life! In daily life, in addition to managing the family, she specializes in tutoring her children, and in her spare time, she still practices singing, never interrupting. We have not heard the news of her comeback for a long time, and fans are looking forward to it. At the beginning of the lunar year, the author met her at the Cao mansion and saw her beautiful face, which was clearer and thinner than in the past, and her charm was undiminished. Her natural dimples are especially beautiful. In the past, some opera connoisseurs regarded her as the Mei Lanfang of the female singer world, which is no exaggeration. Her superior artistic skills and unparalleled talent are beyond the reach of later generations. Therefore, she and Ms. Hua (Huilin) were known as equally outstanding talents for a time. It is a pity that fate is unkind to this person, both afflicting her fate and grinding her body. Her heart is depressed, and her stomach disease occurs frequently. After medical examination with X-rays, it was found that her stomach was drooping. Recently, due to being home in seclusion and long-term recuperation, she has recovered. Ms. Zhu said to me: "This year, I have sent my children to school to study, and Zhu Yanan can concentrate on returning to the stage. At the end of the old year, Master Lin San (Shusen) once invited me to join a new troupe, but I couldn't because of illness. Once my weak body recovers, at the latest in late spring and early summer, I plan to go to Ping for a try. If there is a suitable opportunity in Shanghai, I might as well return to the stage. At that time, if I show my clumsiness, I hope you will give me a lot of guidance." I said: "We are our own people, and it is our duty." Ms. Zhu also said: "Singing opera requires capital (referring to the voice). Yanan feels that her physique is weak, and she is afraid that the capital will not be enough, so recently she would rather hide her clumsiness at home and dare not act rashly." I think that Ms. Zhu's heart is as pure as an orchid, and her words are extremely sincere. Moreover, she raises her children and inherits her art, and her ambition is commendable and her situation is pitiful. Therefore, I write a brief outline, and I think those who care about Ms. Zhu's life and art will be happy to hear it.</p>
<h3>Rare News from the Entertainment World</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhuxuan, a martial artist at the Xinji Grand Stage, sent a quick letter to his father, Gui Fen, who was performing in Kunming with Zhao Ruquan's troupe, because he had not received any news from home for a long time and did not know his current situation. He asked his father how much the return fare to Shanghai would cost so that he could remit the money to help him return.</p>
<p>Guan Shaohua, the mainstay of the Tianchan Stage, took a leave of absence to recuperate due to a loss of voice. It was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, after taking medicine, Guan's voice has recovered, so he canceled his leave last night and went on stage with Huang Guiqiu to perform the full-length Wu Jiang Hen.</p>
<p>Qin Shifu Xu Longgen arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou the day before yesterday and has accepted the invitation of female dan Jin Suqin to go to Hong Kong with her on the second of next month.</p>
<p>The first play of the Great Beijing Troupe's military performance "Strange Silk Beyond the Great Wall" at the Xianshi Amusement Park has been arranged to the third volume. Each volume will be performed for three days. The fourth volume of the new play has begun to be written, and colorful costumes and scenery are being made. It will be rehearsed and performed soon.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lingjie United Association is promoting the fundraising to adopt refugees. The donation books have been distributed to the backstage of each theater. The actors on the stage have begun to adopt them enthusiastically. The Linglian Association plans to raise 600 yuan and pay it in one lump sum.</p>
<p>The Golden Grand Theater will only have matinee shows on Sundays from next month. In addition, the matinee shows will be changed to show movies every day. The films will be supplied by the Lianmei Film Company. However, the evening shows will still be Peking Opera.</p>
<p>The Gong Stage will show the 28-episode Fire Burning Red Lotus Temple matinee shows until the three days of old plays on March 5th. From the 9th, two matinee shows will be screened every day at 2:00 and 4:15. The matinee shows on Saturdays and Sundays will still be Peking Opera, and the evening shows will still be the 29-episode Fire Burning Red Lotus Temple.</p>
<p>After Gai Jiaotian's one month at the Queen's Theater, he intends to go to Hong Kong. The female dan is planned to be Zhang Wenqin. Zhang Hongzhi and Hong Qinggui in February still insist on performing Peking Opera and adding new roles.</p>

<p>Martial artist Xiao Wang Huchen (Mu Lanchun) was willing to join the Nanjing Nanjing Grand Theater last year, but his father Mu Chunshan accidentally fell and injured himself in a car accident and could not move. He returned the original foreign money to Wu Haiqing. It is said that Chen Songqing from the Lujiang Grand Theater in Gulangyu Concession, Xiamen, came to Shanghai yesterday to pick up Xiao Wang Huchen with a salary of 600 yuan and is scheduled to send someone to pick him up on March 1st.</p>
<h3>Zhang Wenjuan Adds Wings to a Tiger</h3>
<p>— Pu Zhang</p>
<p>Zhang Wenjuan has become popular in Shanghai this year. Music lovers praise her as a rare genius in the Peking Opera world. Her art, voice, and appearance are all beautiful, and the plays she performs follow the rules and are completely standard. The Ping Opera seniors Ding Song, Su Shaoqing, and Zheng Guoyi have said that she is the only one who can follow in the footsteps of Xiao Dong. This is well-founded. In the past few months, Ms. Zhang has newly learned plays such as Dingjun Mountain, Zhuteng Village, Wenzhao Pass, Zhuangyuan Pu, and Meilong Town, all taught by the famous teacher Chen Xiuhua. It is said that they will be performed in the Times in the New Year. Recently, the famous clown Lu Qingyuan joined the Times through the introduction of the famous Jing He Yingkui and Hou Jiankun. Lu is a talented student of Wang Changlin. He once played with Yu Shuyan on the stage, asking the woodcutter in "Woodcutter" (the entire Fan Zhongyu) and the teacher in "Killing the Family of Fishermen," and they were known as the best in the world. From then on, Ms. Zhang added wings to a tiger and became even more colorful.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Palace and Pear Garden in the Old Capital (115)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The few segments of Siping Tune (that is, Pingban Erhuang) sung by Lao Tan in the play and the "One Word Angers Song Jiang" and the two large segments of Xipi Yuanban, of course, have many good tunes. Even the recitations and expressions when answering with Yan Xijiao are extremely good. The most amazing skill is that when Xijiao said that there was a letter but it would not be handed over until the Yancheng County Hall, Lao Tan immediately showed a distraught and frightened expression, sat on the chair, and was stunned. At this time, the tall square scarf on his head, somehow, would suddenly stand up straight like Chaplin's spring-loaded top hat. At this time, both his arms and hands were hanging down. He did not use his wrists to help, nor did anyone behind the stage lift the square scarf for him, and of course, he would not imitate Chaplin's spring hat. How it stood up is a very doubtful and strange thing. Therefore, everyone rushed to the backstage after his play to inquire about the truth. Lao Tan said to the crowd: "At the beginning, our master Zhang Shengkui (that is, the sworn brother who once scolded Lao Tan) performed this play the best, especially in expressing this kind of frightened expression. His eyes seemed to be fixed. People often say that someone died of fright. His expression can really be expressed with his eyes. Unfortunately, I have small eyes by nature, and these working places are too difficult for me. However, I am in this business, and the most important thing is to sell a good one at the "critical moment." It is not to shout for people to praise you randomly in whatever place. That kind of hard to be good or desperately to be good singing and acting is called "liang gou xie" by us insiders, which is what Pear Garden people with a little status are unwilling to do. Moreover, the real insiders in the audience are staring at you intently when the play is performed to this kind of "highlight." If the performer does not sell a good one in this place, then they will express great disappointment, either blaming you for being lazy or criticizing you for not putting effort into this play. Because my eyes are small, I cannot completely follow our master's performance to please the audience, and I am unwilling to violate our internal rules of whether to sell or not. Therefore, I put in a lot of hard work and practiced for many years before I developed this unique skill."</p>
