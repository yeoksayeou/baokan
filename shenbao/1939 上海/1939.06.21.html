<h3>美對日提强硬兩通牒　促日方注意勿轟炸美在華財產　抗議對鎖鼓浪嶼並阻止給養事　赫爾稱美關切津局發展</h3>
<p>（東京）美國代辦、昨日午後以牒文遞交外務省、促日政府對於轟炸美人在華產業事、加以注意、牒文中切實聲明、日政府前已向美政府保證、停止轟炸美人產業、但自給予保證之日起、已發生轟炸事若干起、牒文中臚舉被毀產業之名單、後稱、鑒於前此之諾言、並未履行、茲要求立卽保證日政府之將來意向云、美代辦復以另一牒文交外務省、抗議阻止鼓浪嶼之給養事、牒文中稱、今以日本之身份、而取此種策略、似令人不能置信云（二十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國務卿赫爾今日正式表示美國對於天津局勢發展之更廣大的事態、頗為關切、美政府對於一切與在華發展有關之事件、均特別注意觀察云、赫爾宣稱、美國駐日代辦杜曼、會於天律租界封鎖之前、建議由美國駐天津領事、調停英日間因引渡刺殺程錫庚四嫌疑犯事所發生之爭執、美政府對於此意外事件之本身、本不注意、然對於嗣後發展之性質及其重大意義之更廣大的事態、加以日本在中國其他部分所有過去及現在之行動及宣言等、則頗為關切、故政府對於在華逐日之發展情形、現正予以特別注意之觀察云、赫氏又說明美國調停之提議、祇關於引渡四嫌疑犯之糾紛、且係在封鎖之前有此建議、華盛頓方面現時並無撤退天津美國婦孺之計晝云、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）消息靈通方面視赫爾所發公吿、為向日作廣義之警告、謂美國已準備抵抗日本分裂美法英在華權益之企圖、以便一舉毀滅之、觀察家以為美國與英法兩國採取一致行動抗日、或利用此一機會、重向東京提出嚴重抗議、反對日軍封閉在華「門戶」、及禁止外國輪船在揚子江航行之可能、現已增加、一般深信、美國於英法兩國政府决定對華危機之固定政策後、或願採取反日行動、美國政府擬俟英法兩國决定渠等究採何策、以抗日軍攻擊外國在華權益、赫爾公吿、與國會方面指示適相符合、蓋羅斯福總統已反對國會在尚未通過政府提中立法案前、卽於七月半休會也、據衆議院院長彭克海昨日宣稱、白魯姆案包括赫爾對於中立法建議在內、下星期內可望提出衆議院、經簡單辯論後、可望通過、參議院內孤立派仍作妨礙議事之恫嚇、衆信赫爾公吿、乃羅斯福總統使國會、信服制定柔　而有效中立法案之必耍、俾政府於任何事變發生時、得以隨機應變之另一步工作、（二十日美聯社電）</p>
<p>英外相在上院　陳述天津大局</p>
<p>（倫敦）外相哈立法克斯今日在上院陳述天津大局、初述已見報端關於四月九日程錫庚遇害之事實、及厥後之發展、繼謂英政府覺不應發訓將所捕之四嫌疑犯交與日方、此種態度適合已往二十二個月中所依守之習慣、外相决述英政府建議將一切證據提交諮詢委員會判斷、而美政府亦允派員加入該委員會、英政府提出此議後、日方卽實行封銷、日方隔絕英租界之條例、嚴厲達於極度、英人史密斯為日方扣留、雖經英總領事申請交與英員、現仍遭覊押、日方對於檢查運入英租界之易腐食品、及駛抵天津之船舶、連英船在內、作種種之留難、惟六月十八日有往來沿海之英船兩艘循白河抵律、未經擱阻或搜查另有一船僅受草草搜查、天津英總領事對日方侮辱英僑、搜查英船、及干涉糧食供給、已提出抗議、駐東京英大使克萊琪爵士、亦向日外相有田嚴詞詰問、日外相已允從事查問矣、克萊琪爵士更請日方注意天津日軍發言人所發談話之嚴重意義、該發言人謂所爭執之問題、非引渡四嫌疑犯所能解決、封銷之目的、實欲獲得華北英當局更廣大之合作云、外相續稱、英政府已表示願意討論任何方法之足以達到英國在天津所常抱之目的者、卽使英租界維持中立、及不作敵對行動之根據地是也、駐日大使克萊琪爵士、已努力向日政府闡明局勢、渠昨日亦曾與駐英日大使重光葵互作討論、外相之陳述、謹守首相張伯倫昨在下院所發言論之方針、（二十日路透社電）</p>
<p>日方準備考慮　就地解決辦法</p>
<p>（天津）英租界遭封鎖已歷一星期之久、在此一週中、天氣酷熱、溫度恒在百度左右、今日英租界表面上雖似甯靜、而緊張之情緒、未嘗稍弛、不耐在此酷熱氣候中困處租界一隅者、目下已有一種可能之逃避辦法、刻正計劃派輪船一艘、載同願離天津赴北戴河等處避暑者、由塘沽開往秦皇島、所有乘客、將由津乘渡輪前往塘沽、同時據天津日軍當局發言人聲稱、彼等對於英方所提以地方事件解決天津問題之方案、已準備予以充分之考慮、惟此舉須英方無條件修改其在華北之熊度、並對於建立東亞新秩序、與日本完全合作、始屬可能云、該發言人又批評各報所載英方願設法就地解決天津事件之消息謂、關於英方之決定、尚未接有官方情報、惟英方之提案、如志在單獨解決各項懸而未決之問題、日方之不能接受、固不待言、該發言人復舉出引渡四嫌疑犯事、卽為上述問題之一例、並謂日本所求於英國者、除請其無條件變更態度、充分合作以保障華北之和平與秩序外別無其他云、該發言人末謂、美國關切天津局勢之發展、乃屬自然之趨勢、惟當地美當局、現正維持鎮定之態度、並無計劃任何反抗日本手段之表示云、（二十日路透社電）</p>
<p>日報慫恿繼續　封鎖津兩租界</p>
<p>（東京）日日新聞今日著論評、述天律之局勢云、日本應以行動表示、英國如採取激怒日本之政策、將徒使其處於不利之地位、天津英法租界之封鎖、應繼續施行至英租界成為廢墟而後已、如英租界僅擁虛名而事實上已不復存在時、吾人或將設法使法租界當局改善共態度、並使上海公共租界及中國其他各國租界重行考慮、其目下協助中政府反抗日本之態度、該報又稱、在華之外國租界、曾為反日恐怖份子之活動地、並容許北平「臨時政府」所禁止之中國法幣自由行使、以致新政權之貨幣政策蒙受共不利、日本現正不顧全國之絕大犧牲、以期達到對華作戰之目的、認為租界當局對於日本及華北新政權態度之改善、實屬緊要之事件云、（二十日路透社電）</p>
<p>英經濟制裁手　段日無法報復</p>
<p>（倫敦）日軍對銷中國天津市英法兩租界事、頃由曼哲斯德保衛報加以評論云、「或謂英國對日所可行使之經濟壓力、倘無美國合作、未必發生決定的效果、此誠不為無見、其實卽英國單獨採取經濟制裁手段，亦足以使日本財政受重大之打擊、此外、日本發言人雖侃侃而談、謂英國倘採取經濟制裁手段、卽當加以報復、夷考其實、日本眞欲報復、亦殊困難、若果行之、難免得罪美國、此又日本人所諗知者也、至以英國而論、其在華利益所可遭受打擊者實寥寥無幾、除攻擊香港或襲擊英國商船、必致引起戰爭而外、所餘不過上海一隅、但美國在該處利益亦甚重大、未必聽人加以侵犯、」其結論則謂、「天津英租界糧食接濟、倘不斷絕、則封鎖之舉、縱使賡續若干時之久、「亦未必引起嚴重影饗」、準此而論、津案仍有就地解決之可能云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>本埠譯訊　昨日英文大美晚報載經濟記者的翰阿煦勒一文云、倫敦內閣昨日決定之英國對日報復辦法、將不遽即施行、英政府尚未放棄以妥協方法解決天津封鎖之希望、僅以不獲此種諒解、則施報復相威脅而已、英首相昨日又在下院聲稱、渠繼續相信東京政府、不欲擴大不和之區域云云、此間對於英首相所信者、殆所不解、東京之外交家、顯向英國密示、苟英國不施報復　則彼等將以理繩天津之日軍、就另一方面而言、該地日軍、則繼續對天津之封鎖、並加恫嚇、不啻等於侮辱日方現復對英施其故技、即由軍方實施若干專橫之手段、同時由外交途徑緩衝與道歉、以免報復、亦已知之、乃日方今仍出此故技、玩弄列强、殊足令人驚異者也、據今晨哈瓦斯所傳、英政府今在考慮之報復辦法、其三皆為不利日本經營英帝國之貿易者、至其第四辦法則為針對日本之貨幣者、惟對付日元之辦法、較諸貿易方面之裁制、更有奏效之望、為何不破壞日元、俾中止日對在華泰西商業利益不斷取攻勢乎、日元為日本最弱各點之一、日本對外貿易方面之程度、雖在世界各國間保持第四位、日本在貿易方面、雖較任何其他大國為脆弱、而其貨幣則荏弱至於極度、據日本銀行自已發表、日本銀行之正金與外滙作準備金者、共僅日金五萬零一百萬元、折合美金尚不足一萬四千萬元、美國金融家且疑此準備金之數、實遠低於其所言者、而不出美金一萬萬元、日本極缺外匯、死命努力以任何方法獲得此種外滙者、由來久矣、日元之一先令二便士英滙率、實屬估價過高、日方正在有增無已之通貨膨脹中、日本之物價水準、雖經東京政府强力抑制、而仍常在高漲中、在日本本部以外、日元之先天荏弱、已淸晰暴露、在上海、日元與中國法幣平價、英滙為六便十五、此即日元在上海之比率、絞官價打五折八扣之謂、在此種情勢下、英帝國對日元採取堅決辦法、勢必使日本貨幣大蒙損害也、</p>

<h3>天津問題之進退</h3>
<p>以淺薄論國際，頗有人好以面子問題為言；以為前因後果，莫非為此，此而着落，凡事迎刃而解，此亦足以誤盡天下蒼生之言也。自來或為面子而不恤斷送實利，或為面子而不恤啓釁肇禍，世多其例；今則時代過去，高明者不重面子，暴戾者不要面子矣。或誤以為問題還在面子，遂入歧途，自誤誤人，終至誤國。中日問題，國際之絕大問題也，中華國族當前之存亡問題，子子孫孫久遠之禍福利害問題也；乃有以為抗戰乃中國之面子問題，等而下之，誤以為國民黨之面子問題。蔣總裁之面子問題；於是侵略者蔑視抗戰本質之神聖價値而適以自陷於泥淖。獨今日之天津問題，試自多方加以剖析，萬無擴大之理；有之，惟剩天津方面日本當局之面子問題而已。</p>
<p>何以言之？英國久已乎不重面子矣：數年以來，大之如手訂之條的，駐外之大使，小而至於小商船小商人，遭遇種種橫逆，可謂剝盡面子；事蹟猶新，皆可覆案，要為愛惜英國面子者所不忍再為形諸筆墨；然而英國逆來順受，處之夷然，抑或方以高明自喜，而不自以為召侮之漸。侮之者以其為可侮焉，乃變本加厲，於是封鎖天津英租界，視英國如無物焉。夫誠使問題之爭持，名實如一·英國之捐棄權益，鉅細如一；則英國之退出天津，將如退出虹口，日本之控制天津，將如控制沙面；往日往事旣從未釀成所謂問題，自殆無問題於天津。惟無問題，於是於要求引渡四嫌疑犯之外，務求快意，務求恣欲，列舉要求倏欵六七。幾乎希望彼外交官積數年之精神唇舌求之於國際而不得者，彼傾國三軍在華苦戰兩年求之於武功而不得者，一舉而欲得之於天津租界之封鎖。此其欲之奢，行之暴，洵出乎常情常理之外；軼出情理而恬然如此要求者，他無可望，惟望英國之繼續捐棄權益而已。詎知英國能體認問題本質之非僅面子，而所關於實際權益者旣大且廣；體認本問題而更敷衍所謂面子，則將斷送實利；於是喚起歐美輿情之不足，計畫經濟報復之方法，其意態之堅決强毅，數年來所未有也。昨日倫敦消息，雖稱英國並未放棄其友好解決之期望，雖猶推進其柔和之外交步驟；然仍執持兩要點，不容牽涉一般租界問題一也，作為地方事件而猶必駐津英總領確認四人有重大嫌疑二也。於是言之，彼暴行奢求者，於英國繼續捐棄權益之外，初無他望，茲顯然絕望矣。昨日華盛頓消息，美國國務卿赫爾氏之談話，說明美國與英法之在華權益，實相共通；而其左右復從旁聲明英法美國策惟同，於是猶謀所以離間之者，亦顯然絕望矣。日本夙蔑視英國，非以英國實力不妨蔑視，乃以英國政策決不因爭面子而賭實力；今則英國鑒於實利所繫，竟於不恤發動實力，作公開之暗示焉；是為日本所不復能蔑視者也。日本夙忌憚美國，但願美國不為英助；而美國者，旣以日本往日行動，雖侵蝕美國權益已多，尚未直接威脅及於美國之重大權利；復以日本黃金竭而未盡，方源源渡太平洋以換取美貨，遂樂與委蛇；今則日本黃金垂盡矣，為津案而圖窮七見矣，美國必與英法共行動矣；是為日本所更深忌憚者也。夫如是而謂日本猶不放棄其願望之六七條欵，此為常情常理所必無。前日東京電訉，日本當局發表之天津問題經過情形，不無趨嚮緩和之微意；以視日本輿論之高調，以及天津日本當局表示之要求條欵，顯有出入；然則津案猶未絕望於合情合理之解決。所不可知者，天津之日本當局，能吾不執持其面子，由大事化小，是有難言者耳。若日不然，爭面子之時代已過去，此後所爭，斷非面子，而確求貫澈所奢望；則國際大勢若斯，吾人未信彼面子之不為奢望累也！</p>
<h3>英主要報紙促　政府强硬對日</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今晨英國主要報紙、皆要求英政府對天津事件取强硬行動、每日郵報曰、大不列顚不　容好亂者結黨控制天津、如東京無權或不願遏制若輩、則吾人唯一之途徑、厥為取積極步驟、以自衛利益耳、新聞紀事報謂、政府當知在此種局勢中、須使英蘇協定從速吿成、首相昨復吿知下院、此項討論刻仍在進行中、要知今正為完成此舉之時機也、孟却斯德指導報日、日本負責領袖之畏懼英國經濟的報復、較之其所欲承認者為甚、此實毫無疑義、大不列顚不能單獨行動而立卽收效、此殆為實在之事、故不獲美國之合作而實施經濟壓力、恐不能成為斷然性的、但僅僅英國之「制裁」、亦足使日本金融穩固淪於危境、日本現局今已阽危、而仍以金融穩固為言者、特客氣之詞耳、如日本能納唯一之忠吿、如日軍中在熱之頭腦能予聆從、則天津事件仍有就地解決之可能、蓋英政府如能避免者、顯不願挑起遠東之爭端也、每日電聞謂、日本之計畫無一不受英政府之抗議、首相曾聲明東京中央當局制止天津顯然挑釁的屬員之眞正希望一日未絕時、英國殊不欲使政治緊張範圍更形廣大、英政府準備取之朋白的經濟計書之前、殊有給予使爭端限於天津一隅之機會之必要、不幸日方毫無在天津實施有效的制止之象、反對泰西列强之煽動、不特未局部化、且有蔓延之勢云、（二十日路透社電）</p>
<p>薩利斯柏利城　反對派工黨議員摩里遜、頃在此間發表演說、抨擊政府所推行之遠東政策、略謂「日人對吾人所為者、將使張伯倫首相以前之掌政者、不能瞑目於地下、吾人在中國方面茲所遭遇之困難、實為西門財相淤一九三一年在外相任內所行政策之直接結果、為今之計、唯有由全世界愛好和平各國、互相團結、俾為歷史上最强大之組合、使作惡多端之獨裁者、知所警惕」云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>規則中引起反對之處、這在數年前已有發生、卽「香港隊球員在廣州或澳門工作、而彼等之家屬、則在港居留、是吾仍能代表香港出席」一問題、而對香港足球聯賽所屬之海軍隊員、不准參加埠際賽、亦為引起此原修改規則之另一要點、香港方面、對此兩點、前曾草就一規則、送交上海足球會、但後因戰事發生、埠際賽中斷、此議亦逐擱置、</p>
<p>上海方面最近為求埠隊早日恢復起見、對港方提出之各點、多已同意、但滬方亦有幾項要求、送發港方徵求意見、如港方對其建議能予採納、以後埠際賽中、將按下列數條而更改之、（一）「埠際杯賽」、每年由港滬作對抗賽、比賽地點輪流舉行、即香港」年、上海一年、其他各埠不得加入、</p>
<p>（二）會在港滬足球總會註冊、而由各該總會承認之球員、皆得參加比賽、如此規定、則現行規則中之居留地問題、可獲解決、（三）每隊不得有海陸軍球員三人以上參加、但關於海軍隊員不得參加比賽問題、於此亦可獲一解決、</p>
<p>此外、規則中之重要變更、為埠際賽和局時之解決辦法、上海方面提議、應按規則所訂延長三十分鐘、此點港方似有接受可能、但港方足球總會職員、多贊成延長二十分鐘、</p>
<p>埠際賽規則之更改、須俟港滬兩總會完全同意後、方能實行、預料今年足球季開始前、港滬兩方必能完成規則之修改、</p>

<h3>金融　現鈔緊縮　金價影響回跌　匯票有三分鈿可套　浮多獲利傾向了結</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、驟然反動下降、實因邇來現鈔枯短且匯市利率、竟有三分光景可套、故一般浮多有利可圖者傾向了結、加以證券帮復轉賣風、兼某金號多頭亦陸續出籠、允以價格暴漲、未免過高、在回跌之間、買咸咸具戒心、致籌碼遂感供過於求、一度曾退達二千六百五十七元低盤、結果則回跌三十一元、交具進出尚旺、共達二千兩光景、銀樓飾金亦掛小三元、海關金與中英純金均無榮辱、今日端節例假無市、</p>
<p>烚亦跌世一元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因證券帮轉懷賣意、且散戶吃胃呆、致開市即做低十五元、某銀號（代外行）賣予某金號（代投機商）五十兩、價二千六百八十五元、樅而現金號賣予銀樓帮五十兩、價八十三元、時銀樓都吸胃尚佳、一度向上、銀樓帮進證券帮五十兩、價八十七元、繼而錢兌糞進證券帮五十兩、價八十八元、此後某金號（代投機商）亦忽轉賣意、趁高力塞不已、致遂下疲、某金號賣予銀樓帮五十兩、價八十七元、繼而又賣予錢兌業五十兩、價八十六元、時買者漸稀、　息降落六元、某金號賣予證券帮五十兩、價八十元·繼又傾跌十元、錢兌業力塞予銀樓帮五十兩、價七十元、俄再撳低十元、證券帮賣予錢兌業五十兩、價六十元、繼而證券帮叉吐予錢兌業五十兩、價六十二元、後證券帮再賣予錢兌業五十兩、價叉跌至五十七元、時賣方供意稍淡、且散戶趁低納胃尚健、致市勢轉穩、徘徊於六十元內外、將近午刻、某金號賣予錢兌業五十兩、六十元為午收價、午後初開尚平、首由錢兌業進金號五十兩、價六十一元、嗣後錢兌業與銀樓帮相繼力吸二百餘兩、致潛勢向上、錢兌業互做五十兩、價做高至七十六元不久因浮戶趁高吐售、立轉下降、銀樓帮賣予錢兌業五十兩、價六十九元、證券帮賣予錢兌業五十兩、價六十七元、後某錢兌業復來吸收、價父回高七元、某錢兌業進現金號五十兩、價七十叫元、延至晚收某金號賣予錢兌業五十兩、價為二千六百六十丸元、結果較之隔咋軋跌三十一元、（全天三十一元上落、）現金號之本牌金照烚赤高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢均鮮做開、</p>

<h3>印棉猛跌　同業訂購八千件</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市晨初開盤殊為靜寂、價格因孟買帮在市賣出、及利物浦價軟而跌、華盛頓方面對於農業救濟金之問題、迄今尚未解決、惟衆料將於週末可有通過希望、因之同業概抱觀望、後市棉價因中部棉區氣候惡劣、紐奧倫斯價昂、及紗銷轉旺、現貨缺乏、收盤時價較上日回漲四五磅音、印度因遠東局勢惡劣、近期猛跌三羅比餘、埃及漲五六磅音、</p>

<h3>人造棉呢料之不經用</h3>
<p>— （石）</p>
<p>上海呢絨市塲上，木來以英國貨等居多，近年來東貨呢羢，盛極一時，戰事初起，到貨股多（多未納稅），至去年底止，進口續减，究其生要原因；（一）為套取外滙日難，（二）為經濟轉困，紡織呢絨，必須攙和人造毛棉，吾則不準出口；（三）為走私不若前之暢易，如欲套購外滙，非與西人或華人聯絡不為功，由香港轉口運滬，日商行直接頗難運銷，（華人與西人被其利用者，目下以中國局勢有轉機，為數已少，）又因近年所到之貨，十之八九均和有人造毛棉，信用大喪，市銷大减矣。</p>
<p>人造毛棉的呢絨，極不耐穿，為某國惟一的出品，他國商人所不肯為，質地較西洋貨柔軟，價廉而色樣好，非幾中人頗難堅別，裁製衣服，不十天或半月即會起毛，洗時即用雙手搓洗太重，尚要破碎，何况擦板。亦可當塲試騐，先向店家剪一塊小樣，落水或以口啣撕，用二指相扯，十之七八均如紙質一般而脆裂。至熨燥後其脆性稍差。故會算計的朋友，不穿呢絨則罷，如購呢絨衣料，甯願向出樣版專做裁縫批發店舖的拆貨帮去買，因為全是西洋貨，價雖昂貴而耐穿，老實說，人造棉呢絨衣服三件，尚不及英製高等呢料一件的耐穿。然拆貨店大半俱售雙幅碼尺，經濟略裕者可以獨做二件，否則可與友朋合購，較為合算，切莫出了一元以上一尺的價錢買的是人造棉的劣貨，如果買不起英貨，還不如買眞正的國貨（要明白也有冒牌國貨）售價旣不貴，貨色也道地，要學摩登，那就自己晦氣了。可是上海的男女顧客，只圖好看，那裹顧到這種地方呢</p>
<h3>雨季中之雨衣布</h3>
<p>雨衣布霉令為旺、目下已屆銷令、西貨因外滙如單面開水美者、血本由七元七八角驟漲至九元二三角、市售每碼亦由八元五角暴跳到九元二角半、東貨到埠缺乏、市價亦漲、昨頭號雙面紗雨衣布每碼批沽二元五角、二號二元五角、抱別林售二元七角半、英製齊售七兀七角半、</p>

<p>杜粳　自前市一度轉平後、昨晨尚見呆滯、惟後因端節、市塲今明休業兩天、本街店胃頗多添購、同時囤戶亦有動辦、故一霎間形勢又緊、更兼各路來源仍屬寥落、祗常州到六七百包、售方心思頗堅、喊聲又烈然結果厚薄粳價雖屬提升、已不若前數日之甚、僅三角之譜、</p>
<p>變元　鮮有問津、市色仍呆、</p>
<p>客秈　昨市客囤兩淡、市面本居定勢、旋以本街因今明停市二天、紛紛在節前收買、客秈市價遂與粳尖米一致上升、又比前日較漲二角、成交數亦加至五六千包、惟價碼已達高峯、人心亦不過份看好、杜洋尖埠客尖跟隨上升二三角不一、</p>
<p>洋米　現貨昨開三百包、西貢一號昂至二十三元之鉅、緣滬存洋米僅有數千包、市面乃易漲難跌矣、但昨有華商建源及洋行兜售二號西貢米、即裝原包祇二十二元六角、合市石十八元稍外、行號雖以價碼過高、不敢多辦然聞有電報打出、倘能成為事實、則於民食前途不無有裨益耳、</p>
<h3>新麥旺到　粉價步漲</h3>
<p>本批改為四元六角半現鈔澳麥到一萬六千五百餘噸</p>
<p>麺粉　昨市現粉廠盤又見提升、蓋自米價在漲以來、頗引起業內外囤戶之垂靑、連日來本客銷塲逐見活躍、因端節停市一天、均有囤購之意、而廠方以物價尚須看高、更為防止囤戶操縱起見、仍不肯儘量供給、是以客盤又擯持不開、一面將本街批價再度提高、改為四元六角五分之現鈔、良以近日匯劃貼現率甚高、廠方改售現鈔也、統市成交、除本街零批近萬包外、客銷的有二三萬包、大都回籠貨互相授受、市面殊覺良好也、</p>
<p>小麥　日昨新小麥來源逐見湧旺、南京浦鎮丹陽蘇州崑山等處均已紛紛上市、値此粉價昂漲之際、執貨者莫不望高、惟廠胃尚未開展、僅恃本街與行號囤戶之垂靑而已、昨聞丹陽蘇州等麥價開七元零三分、睢亭麥價開七元、崑山麥六元八角半、統市成交的計十三四車、均係本客囤戶辦去、市面步升數分至角許、</p>
<p>洋麥　不斷來滬、前日天祥洋行經理之Anglo　Indian號、由澳洲運來麥子八千餘噸、抵吳淞口後、因浦江內俘筒碼頭無隙、暫在口外拋錨等候、約須下週方可進口、咋日該公司又有Mount　Taurns號裝來洋麥八千五百餘噸、適有十二十三浮筒可泊、遂於下午進口、拋怕過駁、聞二日後再移至十三十四號浮筒起卸、</p>
<h3>糖市　下檔車白　漲四五角　荷粗收還七百噸</h3>

<h3>雜糧　蠶豆漲勢轉靜</h3>
<p>近來蠶豆市面、一因搬運不易、二則銷塲尚旺、故市價一致堅挺、至昨市漲勢雖已轉定、而汕頭帮仍在續辦、本街及囤胃去路亦活、故市氣仍居堅穩之局、且今日端節、該市塲循例休市一天、人心上不免再起作用、咋全市做開嘉定白皮蠶豆九百餘包、價為七元、崇明白皮蠶豆五十包、亦為七元、南翔靑蠶豆五百餘包、價為七元二角至三角、毛家市北港靑皮蠶豆三百包、七元三四叫角云、</p>

<h3>資金充沛市塲穩定　各業安渡端陽節　銀錢業及市塲今日休假　市民點綴節令未能免俗</h3>
<p>今日為端陽節結賬期、銀錢業暨各業市場、一律休假、金融市塲、穩定如恒、各業決能安渡端節、惟因資金寬裕、投機事業勃興、造成物價飛漲及各業畸形發展、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>資金寬裕　金融穩定</p>
<p>上海之金融市塲、自經中·中·交·農·四行及銀錢兩業準備會庫、竭力調劑維持之後、依然穩定如恒、惟因戰區資金巨額流入、以致銀錢業活期存款激增、上海資金、漸感寬裕、但缺少正當之用途、造成投機事業勃興、自外滙套利外幣赤金股票之買賣、以至各種商品之囤積、地產房屋之租造、反較戰前為繁盛、結果租界物價高翔、與工業之畸形發展、實與政府戰時金融政策、背道而馳、</p>
<p>畸形發展　各業安渡</p>
<p>各業因戰後畸形發展、均能獲得相當盈餘、所以端節放出之賬、均能準期收回、同時行莊對各業放出之款、亦能歸還淸楚、故今年之端節、與往年大不相同、不幸事件、絕無發生、各業安渡端節、毫無問題、惟錢業市塲之拆息、昨雖已漲至二角五分、但此為每年端節必有之現象、因是時正春茶新繭小麥等農產品登塲之際、各業需款、設法收買、洋拆之稍漲、在淸理之中、一</p>
<p>運用資金　移入內地</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向金融界探悉、金融業因資金運用困難、愈趨於投機事業、以博盈利、聞政府方面、將予以糾正、希望金融界將資金內移、開發西南、不要作投機之事業、聞已有若干金融界已研究如何將上海過剩之資金運用、允側重於開發西南、同時上海·新華·金城·浙興·浙實·等行、已積極進行在內地添設分支行、以便將過剩之資金、移入內地、故此後之上海投機事業、或將减少、</p>
<p>市民點綴　一如往昔</p>
<p>今日為舊歷端陽節、上海居民、未能免俗、頗有點綴、市上蒲艾之屬、充斥市塲、角黍幾為住戶必備之品、燒酒允見傾銷、間有廳堂中懸掛鍾進士捉鬼圖、以驅邪祟者、形形色色、不一共二、惟最近因物價騰貴、一席之費、頗為可觀、故居民摒擋波節、亦殊不易、</p>
<h3>丁格勒慘死　責任判明　被日軍刺傷腹部後延不醫治以致喪命　英騐屍官之判詞</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、英法庭今（二十日）晨審畢綸昌紡織廠監工丁格勒殞命案、騐屍官海慰斯於判決前、對於日陸載隊士兵解除丁氏武裝後、復作非必要的與理所不宜之行為、以槍刺截傷丁氏、嚴加抨擊、海氏論述見證所發之證詞稱、余不欲綜述所有證詞、僅將稍加批評、余所聆取之證詞、巳悉共最罕見而甚明顯之經過矣、騐屍官</p>
<p>切言各點</p>
<p>爲丁氏被解除武裝後遭不必要而理所不宜之槍刺現丁氏於六月六日在綸昌紡織廠、被不受本庭管轄之人所傷、致於六月七日殞命公濟醫院、彼之死也、乃因腹部被刀戮傷、腸穿受震與流血所致、未會立即</p>
<p>施行手術</p>
<p>益使其不免於殞生、查旦兵自鄰地越牆、爬入綸昌廠院中、啟正門任罷工者的三十人入院時、丁氏欲往攔阻、遂被日陸戰隊士兵毆擊、並用槍刺戳之、丁氏與另兩英籍僱員在廠中因見持有粗大棍棒之罷工人行近、乃取出手槍、丁氏旋行近日兵、以威脅態度揮動其手槍、令日兵出廠、丁氏同事、使渠平氣、將使渠返廠中辦公處時、被日兵句圍、日兵搫落丁氏手中之槍、並開始以槍托擊之、以槍刺戳入其體、未幾、浦東日陸戰隊長野地少佐到塲、時丁氏已立起、而能蹣跚自行、不意</p>
<p>復遭日兵</p>
<p>攔阻、野地少佐是時乃行近丁氏、開始以刀鞘擊其肩與頭部、丁氏俄被曳出至浦東日方醫院、其創傷受浮面之醫治、並拘禁該地一整日、直至夜十時、英總領事署接得其傷勢嚴重之通知而後已、英總領事館之湯姆士乃偕外籍醫生一人前往浦東、將丁氏舁送至公濟醫院、延至决晨五時三十分畢命院中、</p>
<h3>英艦兩艘　起椗出口</h3>
<p>巡艦康惠爾駛靑島</p>
<p>旗艦蠍號駛往長江</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、泊上海英海軍浮筒已十日之英輕巡洋艦康惠爾號、昨日（十九日）侵晨起椗駛靑島、本埠英海軍當局稱、該艦之離滬、乃例行之舉動、又英國揚子江艦隊旗艦蠍號、載賀爾特海軍少將、幾於同時、循浦江下駛、前往揚子江上游、康惠爾號艦駛離後、英浮筒即由英驅逐艦鄧悌號駐油、</p>
<h3>財部所得稅辦事處　嚴防逃避所得稅　稽征機關得按平均週轉率　認定資本額爲二千元征課</h3>
<p>財政部所得稅事務處、以第一類營利事業所得稅、規定資本在二千元以上、純益合資本百分之五以上、方為課稅單位、立法原意、在於體卹小本經營、以免有涉苛細、但自施行以來、少數奸商、故意匿報資本不及二千元、藉圖逃稅、茲經另定補救辦法、特將原令採録於下、</p>
<p>利用限制　故意匿報</p>
<p>查第一類營利事業所得稅之征收商人、每利用資本兩千元之限制、故意匿報、企圖逃稅、其匿報之法、或在賬面上造作不及二千元資本之不實記載、或將資本之一部改列為收受之存款或盈餘滾成、務使資本不達二千元之數、其作偽之術、頗極巧妙、雖嚴密查賬、有時亦不易發見、</p>
<p>影響國課　實非淺鮮</p>
<p>如不另訂補救辦法、影響國踝、實非淺鮮、據本處二十六年度各業收益統計、其資本週轉態、平均常在五决、資本之收益力、不能僅視資本之靜　數額、而應注意資本周轉之動態速率、賬面資本、縱不及二千元、而其營業額及純益額、若與該業一般之比率、不相稱合、是其所報資本、不無不實不盡之處、本處為杜防巧避課稅、公平起見、</p>
<p>按照條例　依率征課</p>
<p>依照暫行條例第十二條、及解釋令第四十四號之規定、稽征機關得按照其營業情形、與上年度各該業之平均資本週轉率、逕行決定其資本額爲二千元、依率征課、以杜逃匿、而裕抗戰資源、除呈部備案、併分令各處、暨逕令各分處外、合行令仰該處遵照辦、切實稽征爲要、</p>
<h3>各業漲價不已　平民生活日蹙　普通飯館漲價一成至二成　無法找零又將錢碼改洋碼</h3>
<p>自外滙緊縮後、各種洋貨價格隨之飛漲、而一般牟利商人、復乘機將國貨米柴等必需品價格高抬、故本市各普通飯館、亦於昨日起、將飯菜漲價、自一成至二成不等、叉以銅元缺乏、無法零找、故將錢碼改為洋碼、平民生活、實蒙受重大影響、至於其他各業方面、昨日宣吿漲價者、計有（一）上海熱煤行、（二）美孚汽油、（三）亞細亞油、（四）大陸鐵絲廠、（五）大光明機製玻璃廠、（六）裕豐肥皂廠、（七）明華毛巾廠（八）晶成玻璃廠、（九）美生化學廠、（十）新生機製鈕扣廠、（十一）宏與鷓鴣菜、（十二）酒精製造聯蠶所、（十三）電機絲織業、（十四）機器染織業、（十五）永華五金廠、（十六）美新膠木廠等、平均漲起一成至三成不等、致一般平民生計、均感嚴重威脅、故各界深望租界當局、迅予有效遏止、俾免影響社會秩序之安定、</p>
<h3>一種有意義的傳單　「美國之恥辱」　美國人斥責軍火運日本　上海已接到此種傳單</h3>
<p>大陸報云、現有一種新傳單、充斥於美國、內稱、美國商人運戰具赴日、乃「美國之恥辱」、並敦促對日禁運、擁護湯姆士之修正中立法、及詆責美國為日本侵略之夥伴、上海亦已收到是項傳單、全文之一部份稱、中國為維持其國家獨立而戰、已引起普世對民治國人民之同情與援助、我國（指美國下同）以</p>

<h3>證券價格續跌　昨日停市半天　全因人心浮動成此現象　政府維持債信必有辦法</h3>
<p>財政部對於維持債信、始終如一、今淪陷區域關稅雖被截、對關稅担保之內債、巳有辦法、以免影響金融市塲、復興金長決照常抽籤還本、惟上海證券暗市、昨繼續在跌、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>各債價格　仍告續跌</p>
<p>上海證券暗市塲前</p>
<p>日起統一各債、因電傳停付本息、致價格狂跌之後、昨日上午開始時、謠言仍多、人心浮動、價格繼續低落、收盤統一甲種五十六元八角、跌三元二角半、乙種四十九元四角、跌一元六角、丙種四十八元五角、跌一元七角半、丁種四十六元六角、跌三元三角、戊種四十七元九角、跌二元三角半、下午停市、原因今日為端節休假、成交之各債、無暇交割、並因債市上落太大、臨時公吿、停市半天、</p>
<p>以往各債　政府墊付</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、財政部會於一月十五日通吿、規定此後關稅祖保各價償付辦法、如依照辦法而言、今淪陷區域各關稅收被截、而非淪陷區各關稅收、已不足償付外債、故關餘担保之內債完全無着、理應依照辦法、不予透支、對其本息停止付給、但財政部為維持債信、對過去已到期之統一·復興·金長·三債、仍予墊付照常還本付息、並不因關稅被截、而停付內債之本息、</p>
<p>統一本息　已有辦法</p>
<p>今年七月三十一日到期之統一公債本息、總共五千六百六十萬零三千五百元、是否實行停付本息、中央銀行上海分行及國債基金管理委員會、均未奉到財政部之命令、雖中央銀行上海分行已電渝詢問、亦未接復電、故至昨晚為止、尚無法證實、但萬一實行停付本息、則影響令融市塲甚鉅、聞已有維持債信辦法、屆時由財政部公佈之、總而言之、決於可能範圍之內、予以維持、</p>
<p>復興金長　定期抽籖</p>
<p>國債基金管理委員會、對於關稅担保各債、照常抽籤、復興公債第七决抽籤、定七月十日舉行、計抽籤五支、八月三十一日由中央銀行付款、金融長期公債第十二决抽籤、定九月十日舉行、計抽籤二十五支、九月三十日、由中中交三行付款、聞財政部所定之關稅担保各債、維持債信辦法、在未經公佈以前、銀行界未便有所表示、是吾發給「准滙憑證」及得向銀行「商訂借款」、一時無法探悉、</p>
<h3>煤值高漲　航輪增價</h3>

<h3>米業代表　請取締投機操縱　訪工部局副總辦何德奎　建議有效辦法維持民食</h3>
<p>米價昨日又續漲</p>
<p>上海豆米市塲、因投機者之操縱、致發生米價不正當之飛漲、影響市民生計、社會安甯、殊匪淺鮮、米業團體昨派員晋謁租界當局、建議辦法、市塲管委、明日邀集行號勸吿維持民食、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>晉謁當局　建議辦法</p>
<p>豆米行業公會及米號業公會等團體、於昨晨十一時、推派陳子彝·朱子香、符前耕·張念萱等四人、赴公共租界工部局、訪副總辦何德奎、報吿市塲米價飛漲之原因、要求租界當局設法取締投機操縱、疏通國米來源、採用有效辦法、穩定米價、何副總辦對米業之要求各點、允提交米糧管理委員會研究辦理之、</p>
<p>囤戶續扒　米價又漲</p>
<p>昨日豆米市塲開市後、囤戶繼續扒進、致價格續漲、總共成交七千餘包、常熟眞白粳、竟破二十二元關、江陰頂白粳為二十一元八角、價格已創歷來之最高峰、市塲交易異常混亂、管理委員表示無法抑低、市塲定今日起、因辦理端節結賬、停市二天、至二十三日、再行開市交易、以前成交之米、大都於端節以前辦理交割、</p>
<p>市塲開會　維持民食</p>
<p>市塲管理委員會鑒於米價飛漲、影響市民牛計甚鉅、特定明日（二十二日）下午三時、召集各行號開會、除討論對內之會務外、並勸導各行號應設法穩定米價、維持民食、又據新聲社記者晤米業代表某氏、據談、米業團體、對米價之飛漲、因權力有限、無法制止、故建議租界當局、採用有效辦法、今決靜候租界當局之辦法、</p>
<p>滬市民食　無缺乏虞</p>
<p>關於上海之存米、尚有五十二萬三千八百二十二包、足能維持二個月之民食、况市民預購之米、雖無法調查、估計亦不在少數、米市渡被阻之米、聞經交涉妥當、已放行來滬、蘇鍚雖禁阻出境、但仍有少數運到、如十九日火車運到二十二車、輪船運到二千五六百包、昨日水陸兩路到貨亦達二千餘包、故實際上來源未斷、</p>
<p>監督市塲　限制漲價</p>
<p>據新新社記者探悉、米業團體為防止米市上漲、前會有不得超過十五元限價之規定、終以無法執行、而吿取消、致目下漲風、幾無法取締、現經各米業巨子商定、縣採用消麗限制辦法、規定米價、如確因來源稀少上漲、每决漲價數、不得超過三角、每日將隔日米價懸牌市塲、請由租界當局派員蒞塲監督、如有超過規定者、即予嚴罰、此項辦法之實行、在避免無限制之在漲、</p>

<p>六枚、射過英艦艦首之上、顯以該舢舨為目標、而圖阻止其運食品入英艦、時頗有演成類似潘甫號軍艦不幸事件之可能、但舢舨</p>
<p>未被擊中</p>
<p>仍卸盡蛋與鷄後、安然駛入支流匿去、日砲艦於舢舨隱去後、復向該支流口射擊二彈、顯係警吿舢舨、不得復駛近英艦、支流兩岸伏</p>

<h3>不上不下</h3>
<p>— 禾士</p>
<p>科學之宜提高與推廣，前已論及。今復就國內科學之現狀，言其弱點，爲同人互相警勵之資。吾國之注意科學，已數十年於茲。政府與社會嘗時時加以提倡，而國內從事科學者，因奮鬥不力，致科學成不上不下之趨勢。（此處宜聲明者，卽國內確有努力奮鬥之專家，其精神及工作之成績，均屬可佩，不能一概抹殺，特其人不衆，仍不敵大多數之徘徊不進者耳）。專門之人士雖日見其衆，乃以所學居奇，爲國服務之心，不勝挾術自私之念。以爲所得之知識訓練，已足驕國人而有餘，卽不復作深造之研求；而對於推廣科學敎育之工作，使科學常識灌輸於社會之下層，如作公開之演講，刋佈淺近之文字，足以增高國人知職水準及改良其生活習慣者，又毫不威興趣。結果，普通之科學知識，不能普及於民衆，科學之在吾國，遂不免貴族化。直至今日，猶不能由舶來品變爲土著，是可痛恨者矣。職是之故，科學在吾國未能發揮光大，與世界科學先進之國家，競榮爭光，國家所有急切嚴重之問題，需要科學技術，以圖解決者，竟束手無策，不得不仰賴於人。而人民因缺乏科學常識之故，其知識技能，亦特別落後，猝然遇此嚴重之國難，任人屠戮焚掠，受盡荼毒。嗚呼，是誰之過歟！吾國科學界不乏愛國有志之士，願各發憤自勵，努力於科學工作之提高與推廣也。</p>
<h3>夏季人類大敵　可惡的臭蟲</h3>
<p>— 星球</p>
<p>介紹幾種撲滅的方法</p>
<p>住在都市的人，誰也知道夏天大敵，就是臭蟲。它吸吮人血，使皮膚浮腫，痛癢難堪，當然也有些人是不致受其害的。臭蟲通常畫伏夜出，令人睡眠不安，甚至影響到白天的工作，板壁，牀褥，以及一切日用家具的縫隙裏，都是它的生活之所。這種寄生蟲，固然由於不淸潔而來，但是，我們往往在服華美衣飾者的身上也發現有這種惡東西的踪跡。臭蟲眞是繫殖易而且傳佈廣的小動物。</p>
<p>臭蟲是屬於半翅目（Hemiptera）牀蝨科（Cimecidal）的昆蟲，名稱很多，日人呌它南京蟲，英人稱爲Bed　bug，wall　louse（牀蝨或壁蝨）。普通有兩種，其一是熱帶臭蟲（Cimex　hemiptera　Fabr），分佈在熱帶和亞熱帶，我國南部各省甚多。其一是溫帶臭蟲（cIMEX　lectularius　L．），長江及黃河流域各地最多。成蟲背腹扁平，適宜於罅隙中爬行，的長四五毫米，闊三毫米，具一種棕褐的顏色。全體分頭胸腹三部，蕃殖時變態不完全。由卵經稚蟲不久即爲成蟲，要是溫度食料適當，從卵到成蟲只須三十天。所以氣候溫暖，差不多終年可以繁殖，至少可以五六代，不過冬天是比較的不活潑而巳。臭蟲的傳佈，固然隨寄主而遷移他處，要是室中無人，它也會吃其他動物的血，縱使缺食，亦無重大影響，往往不食而能維持生命至一年以上。此種事實，中外均有人試騐證明。據美人吉勞爾特（Giranlt一九〇五年）報吿，雌蟲每决產卵自七十五至二百枚，倘將雌雄的臭蟲囚於瓶中，不供食物，任其交配，則其生命可自五十四日達三百十六日。由此可見一旦家庭中傳有臭蟲，實在很難驅除，同時它所處的地方委實難以捉摸。</p>
<p>臭蟲的長期維持生命，完全與溫度有關，因溫度足以限制它的活潑力，能够使它蟄伏，或半蟄伏。它對於低溫有很大的抵抗力。華氏六十度以上生活頗盛，六十度以下便漸成蟄伏狀態。不過溫度達到華氏九十六度，同時增加溫度，它便完全死亡。關於它臭氣的來由，乃是從體中臭腺（Stinkgland）所發出，位於中胸之內，開口於後足基部。分泌的臭液很澄淸，油狀，爲揮發性和强烈的酸性，那是一種天然的防禦方法，但實際與它反而不利，人可知而捕之。</p>
<p>上面講了許多關於臭蟲的生態和習性，我們知道它是容易繁殖，難以驅除。有效的方法，當然只有事先防備，注意淸潔，勿由他處携帶臭蟲的成蟲或卵子入室內。旣然有了之後，下面幾種驅除法可供參考。</p>
<p>一，毒氣薰殺——藥品用氰化鈉（一磅），硫酸（一磅半），水（三磅），（假定房屋一千立方呎）。其手續先將門窗緊閉，將水放於磁面盆內，决以硫酸慢慢注入，用棒攪和。然後將氰化鈉（用紙包好）輕輕放入。工作者急出門，然後緊閉，任其薰殺，經十二小時，臭蟲可以盡斃。此法最有效，但對此毒氣的實施須加注意。事先須將全室之隙縫塞住，以免毒氣侵入他室。</p>
<p>另一法用氰化鈣置於室內地板上，擇溫度較高之日行之。百立方呎之密室，用藥四盎斯，閉室須二十小時。更有硫黃亦可利用，每千立方呎用四磅。薰時置硫黃於鐵盤中，加少許酒精，再放於大水盆中，以防火災，薰蒸時間十八時至一晝夜。</p>
<p>二，塡塞法在室內各隙縫處用種種物料塡塞，使臭蟲居處空氣不常流通，木板上可用桐油石灰軟塊，磚墻可用石灰塗之。</p>
<p>三，傾注法臭蟲常居床架板隙間，故用此法甚經濟，但不能根除。普通藥料，的有數種：甲，將洋油與除蟲菊粉置瓶內，油一斤，粉三四兩，密浸四五日，然後用以噴射各罅縫處，其效甚大。乙，洋油或松節油注入舖桌縫隙，亦可殺死一部分。丙，開水泡殺，亦稍有效。丁，昇汞（一盎司）酒精（一品脫），松節油（一品脫）三者混合，用烏羽滴入床隙，收效甚大。</p>
<p>四，淸潔與悶熱注意淸潔，並須勤於捕捉，以减少其繁殖。夏日溫度極高時，室內燃燒炭火，密閉門窗，使溫度甚高，往往可以窒死臭蟲。更有人試騐以大黃，冰糖，屑碱三物用開水調和，灌於器具隙縫多决之後，臭蟲自絕。</p>
<p>驅除奧蟲的方法，大概不外以上各種。學校旅館等公共處所當然以第一法薰殺最爲合宜，普通家庭欲如此施行，恐非容易，所以只能選擇方便的方法行之。總之，「淸潔」，「勤捉」，那是唯一妙法，決不能任其自然繁殖而不加撲殺。臭蟲咬了以後，雖不一定發生極大危險，可是據說有一種皮膚病稱爲東方瘡（Orieutolsore）以及黑熱病（Kalaazra（就是這可惡的臭蟲所傳染的。</p>
<p>現在是臭蟲大活動的時期，不知有多少市民到了晚上受它的大累，直接身體受苦，間接精神工作都有很大的影響，我們應當大家起來一致進行撲滅臭蟲運動。</p>
<h3>動物與空間</h3>
<p>— 驥千</p>
<p>動物有偉大之繁殖能力。世界上已知之動物，經學者所考定者，的九十餘寓種，每一種究有多少個，無從計算。其未經考定之種類，更不知有多少。只以昆蟲之一綱而論，其數之多，專家謂可與天上之星數相埒。地球上凡可生長之處，皆有動物生存其間，平原廣澤，滋生較易之處無論已；一萬英尺之高山，其上積雪凝冰，可以尋見動物；海底深至六英里，亦有動物；南北極冰洋中有動物；甚熱之溫泉中亦有之，鹽湖中亦有之，極乾之沙漠中亦有之。所以如此者，以繫殖甚速之故。動物生殖最遲慢者莫如象，象之壽命的一百歲，其生殖之開始的在三十歲，生殖終止的在九十歲，平均每十年只生一子，終身生六象而已，其餘烏類如金鷹，生殖亦慢，尙不至如象之甚。其餘尙有生殖遲慢者，然視象與金鷹，仍爲較速。此乃少數之現象。以常例而論，動物生殖之速，乃有一日千里之勢，就蒼蠅觀之，每一雌蠅一次可產一百二十餘卵，每一蠅產卵者凡十二三决，其總數可知矣。尋常魚類所產之卵，可至千數者，靑蛙之產卵其數亦甚多。當春夏之交，池塘之中，有團團結聚之蛙卵，每一團之中有數百卵，而蛙於產卵時期，纍卵决數亦甚多，一時期中所產者，不知有幾十萬之多。某種星魚，每生殖期中至少可產卵二千萬。至微之滴蟲，於一週之終，繁殖可至百萬個。一對搖蚊，在一夏季之間，可生後嗣六千萬萬萬。總之動物繁殖之速度，有非吾人所能夢見者。象之繁殖極遲緩，前已言及，達爾文嘗謂一對之象，所生子嗣，若皆能生存發育，傳至七百餘年之後，可得一千九百萬子孫。若傳至數千年後，可將全地球之空隙盡行佔滿！美國吳特魯夫氏觀察草履蟲之無性生殖，以三千餘個草履蟲起首，四十八小時之後，巳增至三倍。謂若皆能生存，五年之後，由繁殖所生之子嗣，其體積可一萬倍於地球。英人馬爾薩斯氏謂生物之增加，係循幾何級數，地球上之食物，不足以供給。此外地上之空隙，究屬有限，環境亦時有變遷。達爾文，瓦來斯，二氏謂此乃競存之現象所由發生，不亦信乎！</p>
<h3>生髮與季候</h3>
<p>— 顧不問</p>
<p>熱天頭髮容易長</p>
<p>頭髮的生長，一年四季，各有不同。生長的長度，每與氣溫有關。今據學者的觀察，已有一種實騐的計測，試騐的對象，是個五十九歲的男性，在一年內，指定面部同一地位，每天同一時間，遂日監視薙髮。這種指定的地位，是在相近耳部前面大的一方吋的一個面積，使用一種目力測微器（Ocular　Micrometer），加以計測。並記上一天的氣溫平均度（根據天文台報吿），逐日接續連載，並不脫漏，所得實騐的結果如下：</p>
<p>月份　平均　溫度　生髮長度</p>
<p>正月　五八度　·三〇五耗</p>
<p>二月　五四度　·三八六耗</p>
<p>三月　六一度　·四〇四耗</p>
<p>四月　七〇度　·四五八耗</p>
<p>五月　七四度　·四六四耗</p>

<h3>讀過了「愛國者」</h3>
<p>— 林英</p>
<p>我不大喜歡寫讀後感之類的東西，但當我看完了這册總動員上海翻譯者的「愛國者」後，不能不無感」於中而發之於「言」。的確，這，太使我感動得以致忿怒了。</p>
<p>賽珍珠的「大地」五六年前轟動了美國出版界，作者也發了一筆大財，它在中國的文壇引起過一陣熱烈的討論，最後的結論是：表現中國農民的生活有餘，而對中國農村的認識則不足。自然，這是過去的事，現在這部愛國者描寫中國的知識份子，她不僅認識不足，簡直「胡說」！她的描寫，結構，更是散漫零亂！</p>
<p>現在，讓我先叙述這故事的大要。</p>
<p>一個敎會學校的學生以璠，是一個銀行家的公子，認識了同學恩來，就「莫明其妙」地參加了一九二七年的革命；因爲蔣介石在上海的淸黨而被父親送到日本的村木先生的商行裏，而且和村木的女兒戀愛，追求，終於結婚；到「七七事變」發生後一個多月，回到烽火中的上海；一到中國，就順利的參加了戰爭，並且像神話一樣輕便地立刻得了蔣委員長的「重用」，乘着飛機特使西北，在那裹，會見了恩來，常常來往南北。他被寫成了一個低能而毫無思想的傢伙。</p>
<p>講到這故事的塲面是相當的「偉大」的，它包括了最近十年來中國的大事變。自一九二七年北伐起，經過「九一八」，「七七」，「八一三」，而到統一陣綫的抗戰。在日本方面，她描寫了日本的靑年，婦女，家庭，軍閥的思想和生活。</p>
<p>但是作奢旣有了這樣大的雄心來叙述這偉大的故事，她應該對以上事件有充分的認識，最低限度，不應該有造謠與誤解；並且應該抓住她描寫的中心。可是作者旣未認識中國的革命，而且故意避重就輕，將歷决事變三言兩語輕掠過去，絲毫沒談到該事變的意義和情形，反而將以瑤在日本追求村木先生的女兒——王子——的一段羅漫斯，曲曲折折的拉長到佔全書的一大半。其餘一小半雖然叙述到了北伐等等，不　她的描寫充滿了無知，造謠，嚴格地說簡直是對中國的侮辱。</p>
<p>這裏，讓我摘錄幾段在下面，看看賽珍珠女士筆下的愛國者到底是什麼東西。同時耍聲明，這不是斷章取義，因爲這都是作者自己的話，我只是照實摘錄而已。</p>
<p>『三百個日本人——男人女人及小孩——在鄰近北平的一個小市鎭被中國兵殺害……復仇，日本兵應向秩序安寗的北平城作野變的復仇！』作者把通州事件如此的表現，而漏去了激動這事件的基本原因。</p>
<p>『中國人帮助日本；中國飛機轟炸上海！」笑話，一個中國的飛機師看錯日本的目標，把他的炸彈錯丟到一條鬧市上去，炸死好幾百人。」作者不去叙述驚動天地的大塲血戰，偏偏挑選了這不幸的事，而加以諷刺。</p>
<p>對於中國的空軍是這樣的側寫：</p>
<p>「其實，以璠，」以珂對弟弟說：一日本每一件事都在打擊我們，在空軍方面，……一個女人領導着空軍，這眞是笑話，有那一個國家以一個女人來領空軍呢？……」一作者好像瞎了眼睛，她似乎一點也不知中國的飛將軍用自己的血肉和爆彈擊沉人家的兵艦。雖然她巧妙地借中國人自己的嘴說着中國的壞話。但我們要明白筆揑在什麼人的手裏。</p>
<p>對於中國的陸軍這樣的寫着：</p>
<p>一我看不出他（指蔣）有什麼計劃，常我雛開德國的時候，我想我回國以後，自然是耍參加有組織的國軍的。我發現了什麽呢？一大羣沒有訓練的兵士，每一羣都只是服從他們的小頭目，任何民族觀念都沒有……』</p>
<p>更無恥的是描寫八路軍對待俘虜的揑造，誰都知道，他們對俘虜是挺優待的。她却寫着：</p>
<p>「……恩來部下兵士的習慣，把俘虜悉數殺死。……取樂的方式是鎖住籠子裏，或是縛在樹枝上，……又用乾草紮成的又子去刺他們或用火去燒……』</p>
<p>好了，我不願多加摘錄，因爲道樣歪曲事實，含着惡意（我是這樣想）的描寫，全書中隨手可摘。</p>
<p>總之，這是一冊含着毒素的書，凡有正義的文化人都應該揭發它。</p>
<p>最後我覺得深深驚奇的，像這樣一册書居然有三種譯本在同一日子爭着出版，並且動員了大批文化人去翻謠，鼓吹。我想這是因爲一半迷信於作者的名字，一半受着出版人「生意眼」的推動吧。等到出版以後，大家都覺得後悔起來了。</p>
<p>我希望今後對於譯本，事前應作詳細的檢閱，不然，直像作者所諷刺的大世界事件一樣，我們用炸彈炸自己了。</p>
<h3>古城</h3>
<p>— 李喬</p>
<p>徐州突圍回憶記</p>
<p>早說只有二十里的古城，不想直走到黃昏時，才算到了這悠遠的宿營地。</p>
<p>拖着疼痛着的兩隻脚，跨進了給暮靄籠罩着，四面包圍着綠樹，顯得那末淸幽的古城裏，心裏忽然浮起了一縷悠然的情思：這就是張翼德守過的那古城嗎？記得小時看三國演義上的那畫圖，關雲畏斬蔡陽時，張翼德還蹲在古城的城樓上敲着鼓在助威，難道剛才跨過的那低矮的柵子門樓上，身軀高大的張將軍也會蹲得下去嗎？——也許這城門不是從前的那城門，但這城究竟是不是張翼德守過的那古城呢？請考古家們去考考吧！</p>
<p>這城只是一個的有兩三百戶人家的市鎭，屬毫州管，在平日似乎還相當熱閙，但現在已被殘暴的飛機光臨過幾次，人民已被炸跑了，城裏充滿了怕人的凄凉，街兩旁的房子完全緊關着，狗也不知隨着主人逃到那裏去了，連一聲歡迎的呋聲也沒有，在稀薄的夜色裹，只有幾隻蝙蝠張着黑翼，迅速的來往飛着，像是代替着孩子們在玩遊戲似的。</p>
<p>找到了一間寬大的空屋內，什麽也沒有一點遮蓋的，便躺下來了。</p>
<p>「命令！」一個人在門外打着門。</p>
<p>開了門，一個傳令兵走了進來：</p>
<p>「師長的命令：呌楊同志趕快到毫州去偵察，我們在路上衡散了的隊伍，到毫州沒有？趕快要和他們取得連繫……」</p>
<p>那傳令兵走出去了，睡在床上的楊同志跳下床來，搔着頭：</p>
<p>「這黑夜怎麽走呢？我又沒有到過毫州……」</p>
<p>那時，毫州正在打着仗；但不去行嗎？</p>
<p>猶豫了一會，楊同志換上了一身老百姓的衣服，隨着一個嚮導定出去了。</p>
<p>屋裏的人又睡下後不久，一個命令又傳了來：</p>
<p>——今夜四點鐘出發，目的地坵渠集……</p>
<p>還沒有到天亮，人馬雜沓的從每間房裏定了出來，馬蹄聲，水壺和刺刀的碰擊聲，重濁的脚步聲……混做一團，在沉睡着的古城裹響着，死僵了的古城似乎又復活起來了！</p>
<h3>也是「安全爲第一」</h3>
<h3>（六）交託的人生</h3>
<p>— 桑</p>
<p>從前有著名提琴家，要把自己名貴的提琴拍賣，開價五百元，無人顧問，遂跌價三百元，二百元，五十元以至十元，還是賣不出，常時提琴家跑到臺上，就用那隻不値一顧的提琴演奏名典，聽衆靜聆音樂，不啻聞所未聞，琴音婉轉，如泣如訴，好像在嗟嘆茫茫人羣中沒有一個知己似的。典終，奏者把提琴交還拍賣人，仍返原座。孰知未幾，在緊張的情緒中，人羣裏起了噪動，原來有人現願出一千元的代價，購得該琴，但是此琴不也是値到十元的代價而無人顧問嗎？何以後來，琴的價値竟會値到千元呢？無他，因提琴放在琴師的手中，就顯明品格的高貴了！近來有許多人，因沈溺罪中，墮落不堪，旣為衆人不齒，亦屬無可取材，却因臨崖勒馬，歸服耶穌，把他們的身體，交託於神，今已完全改變了已往的錯誤生活！老實說，全世界基督徒中，像上述的例子，多得不勝枚舉。凡欲痛絕舊習，謀新生命之實現者，幸希注意！　—上海基督敎文字佈道會郵箱一二二七號。</p>
<h3>印象的旅遊（續）</h3>
<p>— 黎錦明</p>
<p>接引和尙領了我們穿過佛堂，向西，一張門，直達到一間設備還整潔的客廳。廳內，有八張太師椅于，有光凈的紅漆桌，花瓶，香鼎，籐牀，竹靠椅，泥金掛聯……先我們而來的有四個客人，像預備長久住下云的。</p>
<p>聽說沒乘轎的客人也要好房間這話，一個四十多歲的胖和尙出來了，像有些拂意不快，不發聲的引我們到客廳後面的兩間房裏。我說，「這裏太暗，不通空氣，」他又領着來到前面的兩間窗朝外的房裏。這和尙，濃豎的眉，勢利的眼色，面容上幾乎帶有一種凶像。當聽到大彭無意說了一句，「呵，這裏也有何×的題款吓，何×是我認得的人，」（因爲何×是這地方的要人，）他的面貌立刻掛上一幅笑容，背也屈了，手是展着，做個「請坐，請坐」的姿式。（原來何×是佞佛的。）</p>
<p>不多久，客廳擺上茶點了，這自稱爲圓賡禪師的凶臉和尙連忙來延請上座。茶和水不必說是佳品，點心也足以使多年旅外的湘籍人回想到故鄉風味。薄荷糕，柚皮糖，雲捲酥，蘭花根之類的食物，曾經使流浪的人在夢裏也流過涎。現在，回到湖南，這些東西不値價了，可是不在市上吃足，却要扒上這隔絕的山寺來嘗一兩片，虛掩做客的面子，這也許是做人的缺點罷。和尙看見我這的模樣，有些輕藐的</p>
<p>大的這山除開粗劣的紅米，紅薯，靑菜，筍子，泉水和空氣外，什麼都是貴重的。貨物搬運上來很不容易。他們拿點來待客，可算把客當做神聖了，因爲菩薩的生命也得靠客人的費用養活。但老和尙的田產多，據說南嶽周圍六七十里的田地，都是屬於寺院所有的。爲了田產多，養的大小和尙足，他們拿出身份來，也覺得使富庶的遊士們意消了。俗說，衣食足，知榮辱，上封寺的和尙帶些勢利眼，也無可如何了。</p>
<p>退了茶蓆，到房間裏，凶臉和尙跟着來了，手拿一本一題名册子」，央求我們在上面留些詩句。他一面自炫地，從口袋裏掏出一個小布包，從布包裏取出一隻圓凈的桃紅色石子來，指指點點地說：</p>
<p>「你們懂得物理，看看這東西到底抵不抵得一塊眞和闐玉？上面——這是一條龍，這是一隻虎，龍蟠，虎又踞，像經過人工一樣。這抵不抵得一塊和闐玉？」</p>
<h3>談餘</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>轟動一時的賽珍珠的「愛國者」，我總算看完了。可是我們所得的印象，却正和林英先生的差不多。祗覺得牠在內容和技術上，一無可取，不過將一些東方人的皮毛，向西方人賣賣野人頭而已！至於故意誣蔑我們的地方，無論她，賽珍珠的動機如何，我以爲總是不可恕的，因爲這並沒有必要而是可以避免的。</p>

<h3>電珠工人生活</h3>
<p>— 雁</p>
<p>由於一個朋友的介紹，使我有機會去參觀了一下某電珠廠工塲的工作實况，並詳細的訪問了那裏男女工人們的生活。下面就是筆者把那裏訪問所得的，各部門工人生活的情形的記述：</p>
<p>捒S的</p>
<p>小電泡之中的燈總，它的裝置的形狀，宛如一個「S」字，所以揀燈絲在一般的電珠工人們說起來，是稱它爲「揀S」的揀S這工作是女工們擔任的，她們的年齡都在十五至二十五左右，因爲唯有這樣年靑的婦女，她們纔有着耐心，能精細週到地勝任這工作。這是極長度而最纖細的鋼絲，經過工程師的科學方法的柔鍊和剪軋後；這適用於電珠上裝配，的燈絲，必須經過一下整理和選剔。她們需要具有銳利的目光，吾則這纖微的「S」幾乎不易見到；所以這工作是極費視力和腦力的。整天到晚蜷伏在案頭上，往往使她們目眩，頭昏，背酸！她們的工資，雖較一般的女工爲稍高，但每天也只能差到五六角與七八角。</p>
<p>製S的</p>
<p>這是以燒熔的玻璃管把兩條燈絲黏攏來，而屬於男工們的工作部鬥；他們終日坐在烈性的自來火爐的旁邊，不住地勞作，不論冬天或夏天，終是流着滿身的大汗，濕透潘衣襟！他們的窒息和難耐，和着大熔爐旁的鐵匠，是沒有分別的；他們在各部門工人中是比較艱苦的一種。可是他們的工資却極有限，大的僅和捒S的女土們差不多。</p>
<p>吹泡的</p>
<p>這部鬥是由男女童工担任的，她們的年齡多在十歲至十四歲左右；他們的工作較製S的工人們更爲痛苦！因爲他們終日在烈性的自來火爐旁勞作，口內又要啣住着極熱的玻璃管，對準着火燄吸着，吹着；吹着，吸着，直至溶成流質的玻璃，吹成泡子的形式而後已。他們大的爲着尙在學習時期的關係，所以工資更微薄得可憐，每月僅有一元至三元左右。</p>
<p>抽空氣</p>
<p>這是重要工人所擔任的</p>
<p>一部門，他們必須具有科學和化學的智識。便是：當玻璃泡子吹成以後，必須用化學物品和科學方法把它的空氣抽凈，然後纔能把銅頭子和燈絲裝配上去。他們的工資比較一般的男女工人都耍高，大概每月自四十元至七八十元。</p>
<p>黏石膏</p>
<p>把銅頭子裝配到泡子的上面去，必須黏此石膏。這也是女工們的工作部門，她們不論老幼都有，她們的工資是以包工制度計算的；每千隻以二角至三角計算。所以她們的工作雖比較容易，但她們的收入，每月倒也能差到自十餘元至廿餘元</p>
<p>燙錫的</p>
<p>要把「S」和銅頭子穩牢聯繫，除了石膏的黏力外，更須在頂上漬以錫，因爲這是比較客易做的一部，所以只是由童工中比較稍長的男工們來擔任，但他們的勞苦，比較製S和吹泡的，也不相上下。他們的工資，每月自四元至六七元。</p>
<p>揀泡子</p>
<p>這是各部門中較最易做的一部，只需把製成的泡子中有損壞痕跡的，都剔選出來；這是由最初人廠的女工和童工擔任的，工資也僅有一元至三元。此外，也有包工制度的（限於女工），或臨時僱用的，揀就每千只以三分計算，每天能獲三五角不等。</p>
<h3>除五毒</h3>
<p>— 吳澐作</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十二回　紅粉殲仇難消孽障　綠窗談愛重締良緣</p>
<p>那屋子是有一層樓的老頸子登樓去報告他的主人去了。潘佩英側耳靜聽，有什麽女人孩子的聲音，但也聽不出什麽來。隔不到五分鐘光景，只聽得扶梯上閣閣的音響，趙樂天扶了兩根拐杖，走進來了。潘佩英見了他，禁不住一陣鼻酸，農乎流下淚來，因想：好好的人，怎麽只有一條腿呢？但趙樂天却是春風滿面，臉上堆下了笑來，好似很歡迎她的，說道：『難得！難得！密司潘！怎豳您兮天想着，來看看老朋友呢？潘佩英却略帶着悲哽的聲音，說道：『我…我…我直到昨天，方知道你的踪跡，方知道你還沒有死。白趙樂天道：『誰吿訴你我是死了的？當初滿以爲是死的了，却不想到頭來，只丟了一條腿。』潘佩英道：『當初報紙上，都登載了你是在這决夜襲中陣亡，都說你爲國捐軀了。一直到昨天爲止，我以爲與你冉不得一面了。』趙樂天依然是很殷勤的，很高興的樣子，請潘佩英坐了，自己便坐在她的對面，問道：『那末叉是誰吿訴你我是沒有死了的？』又笑着說道：『見面了，又是怎樣呢？』潘佩英道：『直到昨天，我在惠山游玩，遇見了袁淑文，方纔知道你尙在人間。我之所以要與你一見爲幸考，因爲我要向你一度表明我的心跡。當初你寫信來，要我勸勸父親，不要墮入他們狐狗之羣。那知這封信，恰恰落入父親手中。當時他威逼我寫這封拒絕你的信，却提出了兩個條件。一是與你斷絕往來，是暗地裏派憲兵隊來抓你。你的地址，他們是曉得的，要來抓你是容易得很。我當時覺得你很危險，寗可從了第一個條件，與你斷絕往來。因爲我們相知以心，我寫這封信時，把我們平日的稱呼等都換過了。揣想你，或者知道我是在威逼中的。我以爲即使你當時猜想不出，我也就可以寫信給你，否認上一决信的不是出於本意。誰知他們監視得我非常嚴厲，竟一動也不能動。但我想我們太家正在年靑，總有相見之日，而且這個局面，到底也不會長久的。不想靑天一個霹靂，你竟爲國犧牲了，這是使我永無表明心跡的一日，那是何等的殘酷呀！』（一四二）</p>
<h3>參觀香皂製法表演</h3>
<p>— （張鎮山）</p>
<p>上海的中國工業界，對於工業生產的效率，無庸諱言的是遜於在上海的洋商。近幾年來，固有急起直追之象，然而追是有距離的，說不上競爭，自己還是難以控制自已的市塲。這原因，自然不止一端，而主要的，就是生產敎育未能普及，一般的人才缺乏，所以，液溉工業生產的知識，的確是必耍的，允其是在失業者充沛的上海都市裹。</p>
<p>永安公司現在舖面特劃地位，表演香皂製法，其動機雖然是因爲宜傳營業，增加其產品的銷量；但這個動機畢竟是很好的，無形中可以裨益於欲從事工業生產者，同時還可以提示失業者一條求生的門路，故我在參觀之後，因而作記。</p>
<p>一部小型的機器，分爲五祖，由兩個年輕的女職員分別管理。當喇叭中宜告開始表演後，其初步的動作，就是將碎皂片傾入第一組的攪拌機，再加少許香精，就開動馬達。這種攪拌機裹面有一個軸心，軸心上裝有彎形的葉子，未成的皂料在裏面因爲葉子循環反覆的轉動而攪拌起來。俟攪拌均匀，又轉入第二組研磨機，開動馬達，使機輪不停地旋轉，而裏面的乾碎皂片末，就遂漸凝結成麵條狀。經多决研磨之後，就換入螺旋推出機，皂料由入口處傾入之後，經過機器的壓力，就由出口處溜出來條狀的皂塊，長長的一條一條，再由分切機切成小塊，逐一放上打印機，打成適宜的型狀和花紋，再用紙包，全部的工程就完畢了。</p>
<p>不過，這種製法的程序祇是具體而微的形象，設若製售，其質量和製作手法，自然要相當擴大，而且，這雛塑的表演，關於原料的調配尙沒有表演出來，因此，把我所知道的原料名稱和用量，寫在下面：</p>
<p>製普通皂祇要用脂肪（Eatty）一百分（牛油猪油羊油鳥植物油均可）；苛性鈉Sodiun　Caustie）；二十分；淸水一百五十分；及少許樹脂（Resins）；松香（Rosin；椰子油（Cocoa　Nat　Oil）；這些原料的配置，須視需要的分量而適當調合，若須使肥皂易於硬化，便加炭酸鈉（Sodiumnate　Crystal）數分。</p>
<p>此外，肥皂還有許多種類及顏色，例如：普通皂·香皂·脂肪皂·樹脂皂·藥皂·透明皂·漂白皂·紅色的·褐色的·黃色的·綠色的。白色的等等，這些種類的製作和顏色的適量調和，須要有充分的經騐才能應付裕如，醫如：紅色皂用多少原料加多少銀珠等才能現出合意的色彩。</p>
<p>在上海，失業的人眞不知有多少。徘徊終日，一籌莫展的朋友，不妨去試騐一下，因爲肥皂是日用品中重要之一種，銷量之大，難以言喩。如若以少許資本在家庭中自製自賣，未始不可以餬口。不過，以小資力從事，最好是專做普通皂，因爲普通皂製作較易，而兜售的對象又多，銷量自易發展。現在該公司公開表演，正是一個不費分文的學習機會。</p>

<h3>兩部値得注意的影片</h3>
<p>— 孤星</p>
<p>英國的「不列顚期望」</p>
<p>英國進步影片公司，近來聯合着幾家別的公司，完成了一部「不列顚的期望」。影片內容是描寫張伯倫政府對於英商船及海員於西班牙戰爭中所吃的「法朗哥的苦頭」之冷漢並無動於中。</p>
<p>這部影片充份暴露了英帝國在西戰中所遭受的損害，它以飛機轟炸的畫面，以及其他種種圖表，說明英國的貿易路綫都處在西班矛海岸德意飛機塲的半徑之內，而它的生殺之權也早巳從英國人自己手里而移於德意之手。</p>
<p>它又說明直布羅陀海峽，已被長射程的納粹大砲所包圍，而德意兩國從西班牙或菲洲飛機塲飛出的飛機，隨時有着把英國對外貿易路綫全部切斷的危險。</p>
<p>該片在審查時即被英國電檢當局諭令禁映，並已引起電影界輿論界之抗議與抨擊，可是，抗議儘管抗議，抨擊儘管抨擊，禁映却依然禁映！</p>
<p>蘇聯的「假使戰爭到來」</p>
<p>蘇聯新片「假使戰爭到來」的攝製，是蘇聯當局對於一般藐視蘇聯實力的人們的一個總答覆。因爲國際間有意散佈的謠言，說是蘇聯國力不充，在下决大戰中，蘇聯的地位將並不重耍。現在「假使戰爭到來」一片的公映，便是向那些散佈這個謠言和相信這個謠言的人們，提出一個强有力的反證。</p>
<p>該片描寫蘇維埃聯邦突遭歐西某强國的進攻，於是發生了戰事。但是，戰事結束得非常之快，畫面上完結的時候，敵人的首都已被蘇聯紅軍所佔據，無數的敵軍將校都做了俘虜。影片把這塲戰爭描寫得非常輕而易勝。揮着刺刀衝鋒的騎兵隊，高速度的坦克車，强大無比的重轟炸機，以及長射程的蘇聯大砲，以不費吹灰之力的閑暇神氣，粉碎了敵人的侵略夢。片中若干戰事塲面係自演習新聞片中剪來，最偉大的一慕是大批紅軍於飛機中張着降落傘躍下，在敵人後方出現，給予敵人非常重大的威脅。</p>
<p>「假使戰爭到來」是一張標準的軍事宣傳片，但是它所說的話只有兩句：對於蘇聯人民，它說：「心好了」！對於別國，它說：「假使你來進攻，我們便立刻應戰，而且戰塲是在你們的土地上」！</p>
<p>曼爾奧勃朗在＂Wuthering　Heights＂一片中正快活着呢。你看她表情多麽美！</p>
<h3>北平各科班最近動態</h3>
<p>— 燕雁</p>
<p>北平是皮黃戲的發源地，科班林立，都爲着皮黃戲的前途，努力從事於造就後起人材，例如當連成的毛世來，李世芳，沙世鑫等，戲曲學校的宋德珠，王金璐，傅德威等，都是畢業不久的傑出人材。現在將各科班的最近動態，分別報道如下：</p>
<p>富連成社</p>
<p>富連成社是現在北平資格最老的一個科班，它喜連富盛四科畢業的學生，出演於各地，都極博盛譽。「世」字科的學生也大部份已經畢業，最近社中的學生都以「元」字題名，元字以下，已定「韻慶福來」四字。元字科的高材生有劉元彤，黃元慶諸人，但是人數很少。在此靑黃不接之時，它出演各園完全是以名武丑葉盛章的新戲來號召，例如酒丐，娟娟等劇都是盛章個人的傑作。最近新排「歐陽德」一劇，頭本已經公演，極受歡迎，現正着手排演二本，本月份內決定出演。</p>
<p>戲曲學校</p>
<p>北平戲曲學校的學生共分八科，現在只出前四科，以「德和金玉」四字排列，女生則於第三字上以草字頭標名，以資識別。該校成立於民國十九年，歷史很短，但是造就的人材也不能說少，已經畢業的如宋德珠，傳德威，趙金蓉等，他們的聲譽都很好。最近又有一批學生將於八月一日畢業，內中有王金璐王和霖，李和曾等人。現在校中後起人材有靑衣李玉茹，文武老生張玉禪，長靠武生胡金濤，武旦李金鴻等人，一時尚不致感到人材恐慌。出演各院也是以新戲作爲號召，例如翁偶虹編的火燒紅蓮寺，便是一個最顯著的例子，其他已經出演的有三婦艷，正在排演就要公演的有婚姻刦，忠義俠等戲。</p>
<p>榮春社</p>
<p>榮春社是名旦尚小雲氏所主辦，社長是趙硯奎，現在共有學生三百多人，其中以尚長春的武生，徐榮奎的鬚生較有成就。該社雖然成立不久，但是因爲辦事努力的緣故，却也擁有一部份觀衆。不過它完全是以新戲來呌座，它所演過的新戲不下幾十齣。現在正趕排化外奇緣一戲，該劇即是七擒孟獲的變相，角色已分配妥當，由尚長春飾孟獲，徐榮奎飾諸葛亮，田榮芬飾祝融夫人，本月份內可以公演。接着是一齣應節戲呌「八本混元盒」，一切塲子路數，都以尚小雲本人的藍本爲準，準備於端節演出，藉以點綴。</p>
<h3>評話家王寳蘭之戲裝</h3>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>臥雲居士的墮落與李多奎的上進</p>
<p>老且泰斗龔雲甫物故後，大家都曉得李多奎可以傳其衣缽，其實論資格，論唱，作，唸，樣樣兼全的　派傳人，還要算臥雲居士爲首選，其次才能輪到多奎身上。臥雲亦旗籍，本名玉靜　，民國後又改趙姓，現年已近五旬，會入遜淸時之貴　學校肄業，彼自幼即嗜劇成癖，允喜研究　　，所以他對於老　的舉動笑貌，以及唱唸等等，無不加以深刻的揣華。別人學老襲，祇粗俱外表，臥雲却能把他的起坐，步伐，眼神，一抬手，一投袖，全部能模仿得十分相像。他自個常說：老　坐時總是側着身子的時候居多，這髣髴同我們攝影的一樣，要是直挺着腰桿，芷襟危坐的拍出照片來，一定不甚登樣；並且也顯着太不自然。老襲不但是身子微偏，同時他的兩隻脚，多是一隻搭在椅子下邊的橫木上，另一隻則勾在前一隻的後面，台下看的人，祇能瞧出他的一隻足尖，微露出黃色的雲頭鞋和雪白的布襪套，這樣總比　人瞅着兩隻大脚片的老太太似乎强得多了。這雖是極小的一點佾頭，而居士却也能仿效的神似，可見他私淑老龔時，的確會下過一番研究的苦心呢。從來他不時在各堂會中　演「弔」「六殿」「駡曹」「探母」諸劇，很爲觀衆稱贊推許，故而他更下死工夫去研究　劇，因此當民國初年的時候，他已經很負盛名了。鼎革後的八旗子弟，十大多受到經濟的壓迫，他旣有一技之長，所以也就拜在老龔的門下，正式下海爲伶啦。—（四二）—</p>

<h3>America Issues Strong Ultimatum to Japan, Urges Japan to be Mindful of Not Bombing American Property in China, Protests Blockade of Gulangyu and Prevention of Supplies, Hull States US Concern Over Developments in Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The American Chargé d'Affaires delivered a formal note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday afternoon, urging the Japanese government to be mindful of the bombing of American businesses in China. The note sternly stated that the Japanese government had previously assured the American government that it would cease bombing American businesses. However, since the assurance was given, several bombing incidents have occurred. The note listed the names of the destroyed properties and then stated that, in view of the non-fulfillment of previous promises, it demanded an immediate guarantee of the Japanese government's future intentions. The American Chargé d'Affaires also delivered another note to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, protesting the prevention of supplies to Gulangyu. The note stated that it seemed unbelievable that Japan would adopt such a strategy. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Washington) United States Secretary of State Hull today formally stated that the United States is quite concerned about the larger implications of the developments in Tianjin. The US government is paying particular attention to all events related to developments in China. Hull declared that the American Chargé d'Affaires to Japan, Dooman, had suggested, prior to the blockade of the Tianjin concessions, that the American Consul in Tianjin mediate the dispute between Britain and Japan over the extradition of four suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xigeng. The US government did not initially pay attention to the unexpected event itself, but it is quite concerned about the nature of subsequent developments and the larger implications of their significance, as well as all past and present actions and declarations by Japan in other parts of China. Therefore, the government is now paying particular attention to the daily developments in China. Hull also explained that the American proposal for mediation only concerned the dispute over the extradition of the four suspects, and the suggestion was made before the blockade. Washington currently has no plans to evacuate American women and children from Tianjin. (Reuter's dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Well-informed sources view Hull's public announcement as a broad warning to Japan, stating that the United States is prepared to resist Japan's attempts to divide the interests of the United States, France, and Britain in China, in order to destroy them in one fell swoop. Observers believe that the possibility of the United States, Britain, and France taking concerted action to resist Japan, or using this opportunity to issue a serious protest to Tokyo against the Japanese military's closure of the "Open Door" in China and the prohibition of foreign ships from navigating the Yangtze River, has now increased. It is generally believed that the United States may be willing to take anti-Japanese action after the governments of Britain and France have decided on a fixed policy towards the China crisis. The US government intends to wait for Britain and France to decide what strategies they will adopt to resist the Japanese military's attacks on foreign interests in China. Hull's public announcement is in line with Congressional instructions, as President Roosevelt has opposed Congress adjourning in mid-July before passing the government's proposed Neutrality Act. According to House Speaker Bankhead's declaration yesterday, the Bloom Bill, including Hull's recommendations on neutrality legislation, is expected to be submitted to the House of Representatives next week and, after a brief debate, is expected to pass. Isolationists in the Senate are still threatening to obstruct the proceedings. It is widely believed that Hull's public announcement is another step by President Roosevelt to convince Congress of the necessity of enacting flexible and effective neutrality legislation, so that the government can respond appropriately to any eventuality. (Associated Press dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary States Situation in Tianjin in the House of Lords</p>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax stated the situation in Tianjin in the House of Lords today. He initially recounted the facts of the assassination of Cheng Xigeng on April 9, as reported in the newspapers, and the subsequent developments. He continued by saying that the British government felt it should not issue instructions to hand over the four arrested suspects to the Japanese, as this attitude was consistent with the practice it had adhered to for the past twenty-two months. The Foreign Secretary stated that the British government proposed submitting all evidence to a consultation committee for judgment, and the American government also agreed to send representatives to join the committee. After the British government made this proposal, the Japanese immediately implemented the blockade. The Japanese regulations for isolating the British concession were extremely severe. A British man named Smith was detained by the Japanese, and although the British Consul General applied for him to be handed over to British officials, he is still being held in custody. The Japanese have created various difficulties in inspecting perishable food transported into the British concession and ships arriving in Tianjin, including British ships. However, on June 18, two British ships traveling along the coast arrived in Tianjin via the Baihe River without being obstructed or searched. Another ship was only subjected to a perfunctory search. The British Consul General in Tianjin has protested to the Japanese against the insults to British residents, the search of British ships, and the interference with food supplies. The British Ambassador to Tokyo, Sir Robert Craigie, also sternly questioned the Japanese Foreign Minister Arita. Foreign Minister Arita has agreed to investigate. Sir Robert Craigie further urged the Japanese to pay attention to the serious implications of the statements made by the spokesman of the Japanese military in Tianjin. The spokesman said that the issue in dispute could not be resolved by the extradition of the four suspects, and that the purpose of the blockade was to obtain broader cooperation from the British authorities in North China. The Foreign Secretary continued by saying that the British government has expressed its willingness to discuss any method that would achieve Britain's consistent goals in Tianjin, namely, to maintain the neutrality of the British concession and not to make it a base for hostile actions. The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, has been working to explain the situation to the Japanese government. He also held discussions with the Japanese Ambassador to Britain, Mamoru Shigemitsu, yesterday. The Foreign Secretary's statement adhered to the guidelines of Prime Minister Chamberlain's remarks in the House of Commons yesterday. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Japan Prepares to Consider Local Solution</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The British concession has been blockaded for a week. During this week, the weather has been extremely hot, with temperatures consistently around 100 degrees. Although the British concession appears calm on the surface today, the tension has not eased at all. For those who cannot endure being trapped in a corner of the concession in this hot weather, there is now a possible escape route. Plans are currently being made to send a ship to carry those who wish to leave Tianjin to places such as Beidaihe to escape the heat, departing from Tanggu to Qinhuangdao. All passengers will travel by ferry from Tianjin to Tanggu. At the same time, according to a spokesman for the Japanese military authorities in Tianjin, they are prepared to give full consideration to the British proposal to resolve the Tianjin issue through a local solution. However, this is only possible if the British unconditionally modify their attitude in North China and fully cooperate with Japan in establishing a new order in East Asia. The spokesman also criticized the news reports about Britain's willingness to find a local solution to the Tianjin incident, saying that no official information has been received regarding Britain's decision. However, if the British proposal aims to solve various outstanding issues individually, it goes without saying that Japan cannot accept it. The spokesman cited the extradition of the four suspects as an example of the above-mentioned issues, and said that what Japan seeks from Britain is nothing more than to ask them to unconditionally change their attitude and fully cooperate in ensuring peace and order in North China. The spokesman concluded by saying that it is a natural trend for the United States to be concerned about the developments in Tianjin, but the local American authorities are currently maintaining a calm attitude and have not shown any plans to resist Japan. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Japanese Newspaper Urges Continued Blockade of Tianjin Concessions</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Nichi Nichi Shimbun published a commentary today, stating on the situation in Tianjin: Japan should indicate by its actions that if Britain adopts a policy of provoking Japan, it will only put itself in an unfavorable position. The blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin should continue until the British concession is reduced to ruins. If the British concession only exists in name and is no longer present in fact, we may find ways to make the French concession authorities improve their attitude and make the Shanghai Public Concession and other foreign concessions in China reconsider their current attitude of assisting the Chinese government in resisting Japan. The newspaper also said that foreign concessions in China have been a base for anti-Japanese terrorists and have allowed the free circulation of Chinese legal tender, which is prohibited by the "Provisional Government" in Beiping, thereby undermining the monetary policy of the new regime. Japan is now disregarding the enormous sacrifices of the entire nation in order to achieve its goal of waging war against China, and believes that it is crucial for the concession authorities to improve their attitude towards Japan and the new regime in North China.

<p>(London) The Japanese military's blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin, China, was recently commented on by the Manchester Guardian: "It is said that the economic pressure that Britain can exert on Japan may not have a decisive effect without the cooperation of the United States. This is not without merit. In fact, even if Britain takes economic sanctions alone, it would be enough to seriously damage Japan's finances. Furthermore, although Japanese spokesmen have spoken eloquently about retaliating if Britain takes economic sanctions, it is actually very difficult for Japan to retaliate. If it does, it will inevitably offend the United States, which the Japanese also know. As for Britain, its interests in China that could be harmed are very few. Other than attacking Hong Kong or attacking British merchant ships, which would inevitably lead to war, there is only Shanghai left. However, the United States also has significant interests there and may not allow it to be violated." The conclusion is that, "If the food supply to the British concession in Tianjin is not cut off, the blockade, even if it continues for some time, is unlikely to cause serious impact." Accordingly, a local solution to the Tianjin case is still possible. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Local Translated News. Yesterday's English-language Ta Mei Wan Pao published an article by economic reporter Han Axule, saying that the British retaliatory measures against Japan, decided upon by the London Cabinet yesterday, will not be implemented immediately. The British government has not yet given up hope of resolving the Tianjin blockade through compromise and is only threatening retaliation if such an understanding is not reached. The British Prime Minister also stated in the House of Commons yesterday that he continues to believe that the Tokyo government does not want to expand the area of discord. It is almost impossible to understand what the British Prime Minister believes. Tokyo's diplomats are apparently secretly telling the British that if Britain does not retaliate, they will bring the Japanese military in Tianjin to reason. On the other hand, the local Japanese military is continuing the blockade of Tianjin and making threats, which is tantamount to insulting Japan. Japan is now repeating its old trick of implementing some arbitrary measures by the military while using diplomatic channels to cushion and apologize, so as to avoid retaliation. It is already known that Japan is still using this old trick to play with the great powers, which is truly surprising. According to Havas this morning, the three retaliatory measures that the British government is now considering are all detrimental to Japan's business in the British Empire. The fourth measure is aimed at the Japanese currency. However, dealing with the Japanese yen is expected to be more effective than restrictions on trade. Why not destroy the yen to stop Japan's continuous offensive against Western commercial interests in China? The yen is one of Japan's weakest points. Although Japan's foreign trade ranks fourth among the countries of the world, it is more vulnerable than any other major country in terms of trade, and its currency is extremely weak. According to the Bank of Japan's own announcement, the Bank of Japan's gold and foreign exchange reserves total only 501 million yen, which is less than 140 million US dollars. American financiers even suspect that the amount of these reserves is much lower than what is stated, and does not exceed 100 million US dollars. Japan is extremely short of foreign exchange and has long been desperately trying to obtain such foreign exchange by any means. The yen's exchange rate of one shilling and two pence is actually overvalued. Japan is in a state of ever-increasing inflation. Although the price level in Japan has been strongly suppressed by the Tokyo government, it is still constantly rising. Outside of Japan proper, the yen's inherent weakness has been clearly exposed. In Shanghai, the yen is at par with Chinese legal tender, with the pound at six shillings and fifteen pence. This is the rate of the yen in Shanghai, which is fifty to eighty percent below the official price. Under these circumstances, the British Empire's adoption of resolute measures against the yen will inevitably cause great damage to the Japanese currency.</p>

<h3>The Advance and Retreat of the Tianjin Problem</h3>
<p>To discuss international affairs with superficiality, some people like to talk about the issue of "face," believing that all causes and consequences revolve around this, and that once this is settled, everything will be easily resolved. This is a statement that can mislead the people of the world. Throughout history, there have been many examples of sacrificing substantial interests for the sake of "face," or of initiating conflicts and disasters for the sake of "face." But now that era is past. The wise do not value "face," and the violent do not care about "face" anymore. Some mistakenly believe that the problem still lies in "face," and thus go astray, misleading themselves and others, ultimately leading to the detriment of the country. The Sino-Japanese issue is a major international issue, a current issue of survival for the Chinese nation, and a long-term issue of benefits and harms for future generations. Yet some believe that resistance is a matter of "face" for China, and even lower, mistakenly believe that it is a matter of "face" for the Kuomintang, or even President Chiang Kai-shek. Thus, the aggressors disregard the sacred value of the essence of resistance and instead fall into a quagmire. Only the Tianjin issue today, after multiple analyses, has no reason to expand. If anything, it is only a matter of "face" for the Japanese authorities in Tianjin.</p>
<p>Why do we say this? Britain has long not valued "face." In recent years, from the signing of treaties and the treatment of ambassadors abroad, to small merchant ships and small businessmen, they have encountered various forms of adversity, which can be said to have completely stripped them of "face." The events are still fresh and can all be reviewed. Those who cherish Britain's "face" cannot bear to write about them again. However, Britain has endured adversity, handling it with equanimity, or perhaps taking pride in its wisdom, without realizing that it is gradually inviting humiliation. Those who humiliate them do so because they are seen as humiliatable, and thus become more and more extreme. Therefore, they blockade the British concession in Tianjin, treating Britain as if it were nothing. If the dispute over the issue were consistent in name and reality, and Britain's abandonment of rights and interests were consistent in all respects, then Britain's withdrawal from Tianjin would be like its withdrawal from Hongkou, and Japan's control of Tianjin would be like its control of Shamian. Past events have never led to so-called problems, so there would be no problem in Tianjin. Only without a problem, in addition to demanding the extradition of the four suspects, they seek to feel satisfied and to indulge their desires, listing six or seven demands. They almost hope to obtain in one fell swoop what their diplomats have spent years of energy and effort seeking in the international arena, and what their three armies have struggled to obtain on the battlefield in China for two years. The extravagance of their desires and the violence of their actions are truly beyond common sense and reason. Those who make such unreasonable demands so calmly can only hope that Britain will continue to abandon its rights and interests. How could they know that Britain can recognize that the essence of the problem is not just "face," and that the actual rights and interests involved are vast and broad? If they handle this problem while also indulging in the so-called "face," they will sacrifice substantial interests. Thus, they have aroused public opinion in Europe and America, and are planning economic retaliation. Their attitude is firm and resolute, something that has not been seen in years. Yesterday's news from London, although saying that Britain has not given up hope for a friendly solution and is still pursuing its gentle diplomatic steps, still holds two key points: one is that it will not allow the involvement of general concession issues, and the other is that even as a local incident, the British Consul General in Tianjin must confirm that the four people are strongly suspected. Thus, it can be said that those who act violently and make extravagant demands have no other hope than that Britain will continue to abandon its rights and interests. This hope has now been clearly dashed. Yesterday's news from Washington, Secretary of State Hull's remarks, explained that the interests of the United States, France, and Britain in China are actually common. And his aides further stated that the strategies of Britain, France, and the United States are the same. Thus, those who still seek to sow discord are also clearly hopeless. Japan has always despised Britain, not because Britain's strength cannot be despised, but because Britain's policy is to never gamble its strength over a matter of "face." But now that Britain, in view of its substantial interests, is actually hinting publicly that it will not hesitate to use its strength, it is something that Japan can no longer despise. Japan has always been wary of the United States, only wishing that the United States would not help Britain. But the United States, because Japan's past actions, although they have eroded American interests, have not directly threatened America's major rights, and because Japan's gold is running out but not exhausted, and is steadily crossing the Pacific to exchange for American goods, has been happy to compromise. But now Japan's gold is running out, and the Tianjin case has revealed its desperate situation. The United States will certainly act jointly with Britain and France, which is something that Japan is even more deeply wary of. Under such circumstances, to say that Japan has not yet given up its desired six or seven demands is impossible by common sense and reason. The other day, news from Tokyo said that the Japanese authorities' statement on the Tianjin issue showed a slight intention to move towards relaxation. Compared with the high-profile Japanese public opinion and the demands expressed by the Japanese authorities in Tianjin, there are clear discrepancies. Thus, there is still hope for a reasonable solution to the Tianjin case. What is unknowable is whether the Japanese authorities in Tianjin can not insist on their "face" and turn a major issue into a minor one. This is difficult to say. If not, the era of fighting for "face" has passed. What will be fought for in the future will definitely not be "face," but a firm pursuit of fulfilling their extravagant hopes. Given the international situation, we do not believe that their "face" will not be burdened by their extravagant hopes!</p>
<h3>Major British Newspapers Urge Government to Take Strong Action Against Japan</h3>
<p>(London) This morning, all major British newspapers are calling on the British government to take strong action on the Tianjin incident. The Daily Mail said that Great Britain cannot allow trouble makers to gang up and control Tianjin. If Tokyo has no authority or is unwilling to restrain such people, then our only path is to take active steps to defend our interests. The News Chronicle said that the government should know that in this situation, the Anglo-Soviet agreement must be concluded as soon as possible. The Prime Minister reiterated to the House of Commons yesterday that this discussion is still ongoing. Now is the time to complete this task. The Manchester Guardian said that there is no doubt that Japan's responsible leaders fear Britain's economic retaliation more than they are willing to admit. It is almost certain that Great Britain cannot act alone and achieve immediate results. Therefore, without the cooperation of the United States, the implementation of economic pressure may not be conclusive. But even Britain's "sanctions" alone would be enough to put Japan's financial stability in a dangerous situation. To say that Japan is still financially stable in its current precarious situation is merely a polite way of speaking. If Japan can heed the only advice, and if the hotheads in the Japanese military can listen, then a local solution to the Tianjin incident is still possible, because the British government obviously does not want to provoke a dispute in the Far East if it can avoid it. The Daily Telegraph said that none of Japan's plans are without the British government's protest. The Prime Minister has stated that as long as the genuine hope of the Tokyo central authorities to stop the obviously provocative subordinates in Tianjin has not been extinguished, Britain does not want to expand the scope of political tension. The British government must give a chance to limit the dispute to Tianjin before taking the white economic plan. Unfortunately, there is no sign of Japan implementing effective restraint in Tianjin. The instigation against the Western powers is not only not localized, but is also spreading. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Morrison, a Labour Member of Parliament for Salisbury, recently gave a speech here, criticizing the government's Far East policy, saying, "What the Japanese are doing to us will make the former rulers before Prime Minister Chamberlain unable to rest in peace. The difficulties we are now encountering in China are a direct result of the policy pursued by Finance Minister Simon when he was Foreign Secretary in 1931. The only way forward now is for all peace-loving countries in the world to unite and form the most powerful organization in history, so that the unscrupulous dictators will be alerted."

<h3>Arita Reports on Situation in Tianjin at Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Arita reported on the situation in Tianjin and the readjustment of trade relations between Japan and France at this morning's regular Cabinet meeting. Before the Cabinet meeting, Arita had discussed the European situation and developments in Tianjin with Army Minister Itagaki. At 9:25 PM, Prime Minister Hiranuma summoned Arita at his official residence to hear a report on the latest developments in the European situation. Hiranuma also met with Itagaki and is said to have discussed the latest developments in the European situation based on Arita's report. Arita also joined the meeting. (Reuter's dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After a meeting of the Cabinet and key government ministers this morning, Foreign Minister Arita entered the Imperial Palace to meet the Emperor at 2:00 PM to report on the situation in Tianjin and other foreign affairs issues.

<h3>Britain Does Not Recognize Japanese Authorities' Right to Arrest British Citizens</h3>
<p>(London) Conservative MP Graham stated in the House of Commons today that an official Japanese spokesman in Shanghai had said that Japan reserves the right to take immediate action against any foreigner they deem to be endangering the safety of the Japanese military in the occupied areas. Foreign Under-Secretary Butler replied that the British government does not recognize the right of the Japanese authorities to arrest or detain British people under any circumstances, and has clearly expressed this attitude to the Japanese government. Butler also said that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax had seen the aforementioned remarks of the Japanese spokesman in the newspapers. (Reuter's dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Germany Should Be Held Accountable for Japan's Actions in the Far East</h3>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers here today continue to use large headlines to comment on the situation in Tianjin. Le Temps published an editorial, saying, "Japan's main goal is to occupy an absolutely superior position in China, so that other countries cannot compete with it. This decision was made because Britain abolished the Anglo-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and they wanted to find a way to retaliate. In order to achieve this goal, Japan is willing to try any method, and is also willing to conclude an alliance treaty with any country that is willing to do so." The actions that Japan is now taking in the Far East echo the actions of Germany and Italy in Europe. Tracing the cause, Germany should be held accountable. "If that country used one-tenth of its energy and resources to disrupt the European situation to peacefully develop China's rich resources, then Germans would have food to eat when they are hungry and clothes to wear when they are cold, and Europe would not be in danger of decline." Le Petit Parisien commented on a semi-official Japanese statement (which stated that the Tianjin incident could be resolved through negotiations, and that the demands made by Japan would not harm the interests of other countries), saying that the British government's firm attitude seems to have had a considerable effect in Tokyo. Japan's attitude is that it is moving towards compromise, so that the current dispute will not escalate. We can wait and see. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Humiliation of British Residents in Tianjin by Japanese: Britain Lodges Strong Protest</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita today, for a duration of fifteen minutes. According to Japanese sources, the British Ambassador requested that British residents in Tianjin receive the same treatment as residents of other countries, stating that the Japanese authorities in Tianjin are currently discriminating against British residents, and daily necessities are now difficult to obtain in the Tianjin concession. Therefore, he urged the Japanese to leniently inspect goods transported into the British concession. (July 20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie met with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita today. It is reported that Sir Craigie protested in strong terms regarding the treatment of British residents passing through Japanese obstacles in Tianjin. (July 20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, met with Foreign Minister Arita at noon today regarding the situation in Tianjin. It is reported that the British Ambassador lodged a very strong protest regarding the barbaric treatment suffered by British people passing through Japanese obstacles. (July 19th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) The diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Telegraph stated today that Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax informed Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru last night of the British government's attitude toward the general situation in the Far East, and the extent of opposition expressed here to the generally irreconcilable demands made upon the Japanese government. Regarding the current events in Tianjin, the Foreign Secretary solemnly stated that the government strongly objects to the unpleasant news received of British women being subjected to humiliation and unnecessary strip searches of British residents. (July 20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Since the blockade of the British and French concessions in Tianjin began a week ago, British people have been repeatedly subjected to insults. The British authorities have recently received reports of what can almost be described as the worst insults. In one instance, two British men were completely stripped naked by search personnel and subjected to desecrating treatment. Their clothes were then returned outside the search room, forcing them to stand naked in front of a crowd of Chinese people to re-dress. Chinese employees of the British Municipal Council, including police, received threatening leaflets. The Municipal Council is now facing a very serious situation. It is reported that these leaflets were sent out by plainclothes personnel from the Japanese military's special service department, stating that if they did not resign from their positions with the British Municipal Council, action would be taken against their families. The British Consul-General is now lodging a strong protest against this. It is reported that many of those threatened are seriously considering resigning, as most of their families live outside the concession and fear being harmed. It is reported that the Japanese have investigated and registered the British Municipal Council employees and their families living in areas controlled by the Japanese. (July 20th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Sir Robert Craigie Clarifies the Situation to Japan</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax received Japanese Ambassador Shigemitsu Mamoru at the Foreign Office this evening. The conversation lasted for one hour. Both sides remained silent about the outcome of the conversation. Prime Minister Chamberlain mentioned the above-mentioned meeting when answering questions in the House of Commons, and said that British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, is also working hard to clarify the situation to the Japanese government. The British side's decision to take this step was determined by the Cabinet Foreign Policy Committee meeting at 10 Downing Street, with the aim of gaining a clear understanding of the Japanese government's attitude towards the British concessions in North China. The general public in London believes that the serious deterioration of British-Japanese relations last weekend was caused by the inclusion of external incidents in the original differences of opinion between British and Japanese authorities in North China on seemingly illegal issues. If both Britain and Japan can clarify the confusing situation and limit the discussion to simple points, it is hoped that both sides can achieve a friendly solution locally. (July 19th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Ambassador Guo Visits Foreign Secretary: No Extradition of Suspects</h3>
<p>(London) Chinese Ambassador to Britain, Guo Taiqi, visited British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax at 5:30 PM today and reiterated that the four suspects in the Cheng assassination case in Tianjin must not be extradited to the Japanese side. According to reports, Ambassador Guo had previously protested to the central government that extraditing these four people would be tantamount to recognizing the "Provisional Government" in Beiping.

<h3>Chongqing Municipal Government Enforces Strict Ban on Opium: Chairman Chiang's Order Implemented</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chongqing Municipal Government has, from today, implemented Chairman Chiang's order from the end of June to ban the smoking of opium. The eighty opium shops and nine opium wholesale dealers here have been ordered by the municipal government to close immediately and are not allowed to operate. The police, using the Baojia system, are conducting door-to-door searches of citizens to investigate those who smoke opium. Those who have already quit their addiction are being investigated. Those who have not yet quit will be sent by the Health Department to various opium cessation centers in the suburbs to quit opium. After quitting, they will be sent to labor teams to participate in the construction of greater Chongqing. Today, the Municipal Government also issued a notice to the citizens, stating that the deadline for quitting opium is only ten days, and explaining the meaning of quitting this bad habit. At the same time, slogans for quitting opium are posted everywhere in the streets and alleys, and leaflets are distributed along the way. According to reports, the Chongqing Opium Cessation Center can help more than 600 opium addicts quit each month. Before the anti-opium movement was launched last year, there were 50,000 opium addicts, consuming 6,670 pounds of opium per month. (July 20th)</p>

<h3>Since the Blockade of Gulangyu, the Food Problem Has Become Increasingly Serious; Japanese Consul in Xiamen Says Diplomatic Negotiations Will Reopen; Uchida Refuses to Disclose Instructions from the Japanese Government</h3>
<p>Gulangyu: As a result of the continued blockade of this public concession by the Japanese side, the food situation has become increasingly serious. The authorities of Britain, the United States, and France have organized an International Food Committee to find ways to import food from foreign ships.

He was summoned back to Tokyo to report on the Gulangyu situation and to obtain instructions regarding the continuation of negotiations on the Gulangyu incident, but Uchida refused to disclose the instructions given to him by the Japanese government, only stating that Japan only wants the Gulangyu public concession to become a safe place for all foreigners to live, and not a base for the Kuomintang government's anti-Japanese activities. (July 20th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) During the House of Commons meeting today, Labor MP Mr. Balinger asked the government whether special arrangements had been made to provide sufficient food supplies to the residents of the British concessions in Tianjin and Gulangyu.

The food situation in Gulangyu is currently not serious, but there may be difficulties in the supply of firewood, meat, and vegetables. A food committee has been organized there and hopes to find ways to transport supplies from other ports by British ships. (July 19th, Reuters)</p>

<h3>British Warship Unloads Cargo in Wuhu; Japanese Authorities Protest and Demand Apology</h3>
<p>According to the Zi Lin Bao, the Associated Press's Nanjing dispatch on the 19th reports that Japanese military authorities lodged a strong protest with the British naval authorities in Shanghai today, opposing the British warship HMS Scarab unloading cargo in Wuhu on the 14th of this month without notifying the Japanese authorities of the nature and quantity of the cargo. It is reported that a team of Japanese soldiers and officers attempted to prevent the cargo from being unloaded ashore, but were confronted by British sailors with machine guns. The Japanese authorities are now demanding an apology and a guarantee that similar actions will not occur in the future. According to the protest, the British warship's actions violated the agreement between the Japanese military and the British naval authorities, causing resentment among the Japanese military authorities. Only the patience of the Japanese soldiers prevented bloodshed. On June 3rd, the Japanese military and the British naval authorities agreed that if British warships wished to unload cargo at various ports along the Yangtze River, they should notify the British authorities of the nature and quantity of the cargo in advance. At 9:00 AM on the 6th of this month, the British warship attempted to unload cargo ashore in Wuhu without notifying the Japanese authorities in advance, which was a violation of the agreement. When the Japanese military authorities intervened, the British warship abandoned its attempt to unload cargo. Japanese sentries guarding the left side of the warehouse attempted to prevent the cargo from landing, but two boxes had already been transported into the warehouse, and another 145 boxes were unloaded at the entrance. The Japanese sentries immediately reported this matter. Ten Japanese soldiers and officers rushed to the scene to investigate, and armed British sailors confronted them with two machine guns, threatening them. The Japanese side believes that the actions of the British sailors were "very unfriendly." The Japanese side did not receive any notification before the ship attempted to unload cargo in Wuhu. The commander of HMS Scarab claimed that he notified Lieutenant Saito near the Swire dock in Wuhu on the morning of the 11th of this month. However, Lieutenant Saito did not go to that dock on that day. The British warship's commander has not yet provided any notification regarding the type and quantity of the cargo being unloaded.</p>

Only that separated by six months, Chongqing has significant differences, such as the efficiency of the various government agencies, significantly improved from the past. Various work, can proceed smoothly. At the same time, transportation in the southwest, also much improved than the usual. For example, from Kunming to Guiyang, at the time of his departure from China back to the United States, it took two and a half days to arrive, but today has been reduced to one day. Also such as from Guiyang to Chongqing, in the past, not less than two days, now it is reduced to one and a half days. The people and their governments of Yunnan, I firmly believe that their resolute support of the central government's plan to resist is sincere. Regarding the reduction in freight tariffs on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, and the problem of moving coastal defense to Shankou, the American Ambassador cannot comment due to lack of French proficiency and not reading French newspapers. Also the American Ambassador, to the problem of the Japanese blockade of the Tianjin concession and Gulangyu, often smiled and did not answer. Talking about neutrality law, Johnson stated, of course the United States must do something, but what that action will be, no one knows yet. The American Ambassador has now moved into the newly built embassy on the south bank of the Yangtze River. Talking about the Japanese bombings, Johnson recognized Chongqing suffered more heavily, compared to Hankou. Because the houses here, mostly made of wood, and the population is extremely crowded.

<h3>After Chongqing Suffered a Brutal Bombing by Japanese Aircraft, Aerial Defense and Evacuation Construction Were Actively Improved, and Economic and Production &amp; Sales Plans Were Developed</h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Since the brutal bombing of Chongqing on May 25th, the city has resolved to take action on Chongqing's air defense, evacuation construction, and central government news. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Improving Air Defense</p>
<p>To prevent indiscriminate bombing by Japanese aircraft and reduce the power of incendiary bombs, the Evacuation Construction Committee has long stipulated that narrow streets and lanes be widened to create "Peace Alleys." Sixteen alleys are to be widened to 15 meters, and sixty-seven alleys to 10 meters. However, progress was previously hampered by construction delays, and by mid-May, only two had been completed. Since the bombing on May 12th, demolition has been swift and active. As a result, upon entering Chongqing recently, all that can be heard in the streets and alleys is the sound of houses being torn down. According to city government sources, it is expected that this work will be completed across the city by around June 22nd. As for areas destroyed and burned in previous bombings, there are no immediate plans to rebuild. Construction will resume after the overall reconstruction plan is determined.</p>
<p>Chongqing has already built one hundred air raid shelters for passive air defense. It is now reported that another one hundred will be built to facilitate the escape of the few remaining residents during air raids. Furthermore, the local air defense authorities have decided to pilot the issuance of preliminary warnings to allow residents to evacuate quickly before air raids. In the future, whenever there is news of Japanese aircraft activity on the Sichuan border, this warning will be issued one and a half to two hours before the air raid alarm, allowing residents to evacuate at their leisure. This will be implemented within a week at the latest. After the air raids on May 12th and May 25th, traitors were discovered in the suburbs of Chongqing. Consequently, the Garrison Headquarters has issued measures for issuing residence permits and exit permits during emergencies, established inspection rules for land, water, and air, and restricted the movement of people. Anyone residing in Chongqing during an emergency must first obtain a residence permit. Inspection posts have been set up at all major water and land entrances to the city. Based on the inspection results, exit permits are issued or entry into the city is prohibited to prevent spies from infiltrating.</p>
<p>Efforts at Evacuation Construction</p>
<p>The Chongqing Evacuation Construction Committee, in order to meet the needs of evacuating the population during emergencies, has formulated measures for adjusting houses in the evacuation zones (number of counties and districts omitted) within each township and village, and is implementing these adjustments. The measures distinguish between houses in each township and village as (1) public houses, including ancestral halls, temples, monasteries, guild halls, and schools that have been closed; (2) privately owned houses, i.e., private residences. It is stipulated that when public houses are located in villages, the original residents will move into private houses in the villages. Monks and nuns in temples should find ways to consolidate and vacate. Those in towns and cities should either evacuate to villages or monks and nuns should completely vacate. Those occupied by the military or local groups should also consolidate and vacate as much as possible. All guest rooms, medical rooms, accounting rooms, and storage rooms in privately owned houses must be vacated. For families with few members and larger houses, the principle of vacating is that married couples are allowed to occupy one room, with children under ten years old living within. Unmarried people will share a room, with two to six people sharing one room depending on its size. The elderly, weak, women, and children who do not need to stay in the cities and towns should evacuate to the countryside. All public and private houses will be forcibly enforced by the county government supervising the district, neighborhood, and "jia" leaders. Those who are lenient or disobedient will be investigated by the county government and reported for disciplinary action depending on the severity of the circumstances. All vacated houses will be registered by the county government, and the rent will be assessed according to local conditions. They will be rented to evacuees, and landlords are not allowed to raise rents. When evacuees arrive at the designated evacuation sites, the district, neighborhood, and "jia" leaders under the county government will be responsible for allocating housing and guiding resettlement.</p>
<p>The New Life Movement Headquarters has selected two sites, each building twelve simple houses with five rooms each, to help the government evacuate the population, provide relief to refugees in Chongqing with productive skills, avoid unnecessary sacrifices, and increase production in the rear. These will be established as wartime production new villages, rented to various skilled production workers at the lowest rent as production sites. The villages will have public canteens, public toilets, and public bathhouses for management purposes, and the New Life Movement will be implemented to cultivate their collective living habits. Each village will have one chief officer and several officers to handle registration and sanitation matters. At the same time, in order to supply the necessities of life for the people who need to stay in Chongqing, and to help refugees with specialized production skills, so as to regulate wartime consumption, a certain location has been selected to prepare for the establishment of a wartime consumer market, divided into several units, and rented to various participating shops at the lowest rent. The market will also have one chief officer and several officers to handle management, registration, and sales matters.</p>
<p>Relief for Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Since Chongqing has suffered repeated air raids, in addition to the joint office established by the Party, military, and government agencies for emergency relief, the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, in accordance with the government's intention to provide relief, have allocated a special fund of 400,000 yuan to jointly provide interest-free loans to disaster victims. Stores or small industries that have been destroyed or affected by the disaster, with capital under 2,000 yuan, who intend to relocate and resume business, or whose families have been destroyed and need funds to operate small businesses or handicrafts to maintain their livelihoods, can apply for loans. The Relief Committee has also established the Chongqing Small Loan Office to facilitate the livelihoods of poor and disaster-stricken refugees, allocating a fund of 200,000 yuan to provide small loans to poor and disaster-stricken refugees. It will officially begin operations on June 1st. Poor and disaster-stricken refugees who are engaged in small businesses or handicrafts, as well as other legitimate businesses that can make a living, and who lack capital, can obtain a certificate from the local government or social organization, as well as a sufficient guarantee, and apply for a loan from the office without interest or any fees.</p>
<p>The China Industrial Cooperative Association has recently been working hard to carry out this relief effort, registering people in preparation for introducing them to work. The association also provides assistance to small factories that need to relocate, as it is originally committed to providing loans to support industrial technicians in establishing various wartime industries.</p>
<p>Economic Construction</p>
<p>In order to develop economic construction and enhance the strength of the war of resistance, the central government has ordered the Ministry of Economic Affairs to establish a Cooperative Affairs Administration to actively promote and improve cooperative undertakings throughout the country. The administration was established on May 29th, and the director is Shou Miancheng, the director of the Cooperative College of the Central Political School.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Credit Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in order to circulate rural finance and increase production in the rear, has been approved by the Supreme National Defense Council to establish 100 warehouses and 100 treasuries in the northwest and southwest provinces. They will be opened in the shortest possible time. The supervisors and administrators of each treasury have been trained by the administration's special training class. The second session has now been completed and will be distributed to various locations to start work.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs has previously made efforts to assist and guide the cotton mills that have moved to Sichuan to resume work, and has done its best to promote hand spinning and weaving. The supply of raw cotton is particularly important. Recently, it has drafted measures to improve cotton production, promote the cultivation of improved cotton varieties, and stipulate that the guaranteed price of improved cotton produced in Sichuan this autumn will be 8% higher than ordinary cotton. The Agricultural Credit Administration is responsible for the cotton purchasing work. The quantity purchased will be allocated according to the number of spindles opened by each factory. The responsibility for losses will be shared proportionally to the amount of cotton used. At the same time, the Sichuan Construction Department will announce and inform cotton farmers that they should abide by the guidance, improve cotton production, and guarantee the higher price of improved cotton, so that the people of Sichuan will be happy to actively promote planting.</p>
<p>Production and Sales Management</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs recently established a Cement Management Committee jointly with the Ministries of Military Affairs, Political Affairs, and Communications. Cement management will be implemented from June 1st. Zhang Zi, Deputy Director of the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office, will concurrently serve as Chairman. It is stipulated that the Management Committee may, when necessary, order cement manufacturers to pre-store enough cement for two months of sales to meet urgent national defense needs. Furthermore, it may, when necessary, comprehensively allocate cement and limit its price. When allocating cement for uses, it will be allocated in the following order: (1) related to national defense; (2) related to production or transportation; (3) ordinary. It is also stipulated that the cement price will be set once a month. When setting the price, the profit should not exceed 20% of the total cost and freight. The Ministry of Finance has recently revised the Outline of Measures for Managing the Export Trade of Tea throughout the Country in order to promote the export of tea, and has formulated general rules for the organization of tea management agencies in various provinces in order to increase production. The Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance is responsible for the overall management of tea purchases and sales in various provinces, and the China Tea Company will use its existing organization to assist as much as possible. The China Tea Company will handle overseas sales. The provincial governments will organize tea management agencies to manage the production and transportation of tea in various provinces, in consultation with the Trade Commission. The general rules for the organization of management agencies stipulate that key personnel in tea management should be jointly decided by the provincial government and the Trade Commission of the Ministry of Finance, and appointed by the provincial government. The management agencies may establish several sections and divisions depending on the complexity of the business, and may establish several offices at tea manufacturing or transportation centers. Their duties are: (1) handling the registration and loan matters of tea farmers' cooperatives and tea factories; (2) guiding the organization, equipment, and improvement of tea farmers' cooperatives and tea factories; (3) guiding tea production and improvement, and handling inspection matters; (4) handling tea transportation and warehousing matters; (5) assisting in the transportation of tea passing through neighboring provinces, and other related matters; (6) handling tea purchases entrusted by the Trade Commission; (7) other matters related to tea management. It is also stipulated that when purchasing tea, an evaluation committee should be organized to ensure the fairness of pricing.</p>
<p>News from the Aftermath of the Brutal Bombing</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter will briefly supplement the disaster and news from the aftermath of the fourth brutal bombing of Chongqing on May 25th. The number of demolition bombs and incendiary bombs dropped by Japanese aircraft on that day was no less than the most brutal "New May 4th." The affected areas were similar to the New May 3rd disaster area, and many places were re-bombed. Fortunately, the population had been evacuated as much as possible. Apart from many houses being completely destroyed or partially damaged, the number of people killed and injured was said to be less than 200. Three fires were caused by incendiary bombs, and the affected areas were fortunately not very large due to effective prevention and rescue. There were also three or four other locations that did not spread. Houses destroyed included the Chongqing Bank of the Bank of Sichuan Province, Tiger Brand Wing On Tong, the former site of the Industrial and Mining Adjustment Office, and hundreds of locations, including parts of the (illegible) and (illegible) banks, and park buildings. Merchants and residents burned included Guangyi Bookstore and a portion of World Bookstore, a total of a dozen or twenty. It was rumored that a poisonous gas bomb had fallen somewhere, but fortunately it did not explode. The locations bombed repeatedly on the 3rd and 25th were concentrated around a certain Confucius Temple. After the bombing, none of the large temple buildings were intact, but the statue of Confucius still sat precariously in the temple hall, completely unharmed. As for the Japanese broadcast claiming that Yu Youren, the President of the Control Yuan, had been bombed to death on that day, in fact, Mr. Yu had broadcast a speech at 7 pm on the 4th, strongly condemning the Japanese for spreading rumors. Furthermore, on that day, Japanese aircraft were shot down by the Chinese Air Force and anti-aircraft artillery, which was witnessed by the people in the suburbs of Chongqing. It is understood that one of them was a command plane with seven pilots on board, all of whom died in the crash. The fuselage was broken into several pieces. It was discovered a few days ago in a certain location 50 miles away from Jiangjin. The bodies of the pilots were found within three or four miles around. Yesterday (5th), the wreckage of the plane was transported from Jiangjin and will be publicly displayed at a selected location, replacing one of the three planes shot down on May 3rd that was recovered and put on display. It is reported that the plane was a Type 96 heavy bomber with the number 4173. A reconnaissance tool of the enemy commander was also found inside the plane, along with orders on how to command the bombing of the bustling streets of Chongqing. (June 6th)</p>
<h3>Drought in Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changshu</h3>
<p>Ponds and Marshes Dried Up, Difficult to Transplant Seedlings</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Correspondence: It is the early summer season, already the season for farming, and farmers in the countryside are busy transplanting seedlings. However, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Changshu, and other counties have not had rain for one or two months. There is no water in the fields, making it difficult to transplant seedlings. Many ponds and marshes have dried up. In the past, if this phenomenon occurred, motor pumps would be hired to draw water. Currently, diesel is expensive, and farmers cannot afford to hire motor pumps. The Zhenjiang puppet government has implemented rain prayers to fool the people. The puppet governor has banned slaughtering since the 16th and visits the City God Temple morning and evening to offer incense and perform three kneelings and nine prostrations to the Dragon God, hoping to appeal to Heaven and receive abundant rain.</p>
<h3>Lack of Copper Coins in Various Counties of Suzhou and Wuxi</h3>
<p>Puppet Side Plans to Issue One-Cent Puppet Currency</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Copper coins and subsidiary coins were not originally lacking in the interior of Suzhou and Wuxi. Recently, Shanghai has suddenly experienced a copper coin shortage, which has spread to the interior. The number of copper coins and one-cent subsidiary coins on the market has suddenly decreased. One yuan in legal tender can only be exchanged for 290 copper coins, and it is refused to exchange for the full five yuan at once. At the same time, various tobacco merchants also believe that the lack of copper coins makes circulation inconvenient, so they plan to restore the money token system from decades ago. The puppet side has also suggested that the "Huaxing Bank" issue a one-cent puppet subsidiary currency to circulate on the market.</p>
<h3>Taixing City Market as Usual After Japanese Aircraft Bombing</h3>
<p>Li Mingyang Allocates Funds to Relieve Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Li Mingyang Allocates Funds to Relieve Disaster Victims Taixing Correspondence: Taixing County was suddenly subjected to a wild rampage by Japanese aircraft around 2 pm on the 14th, resulting in the deaths and injuries of 20 to 30 civilians. Local authorities have provided relief separately. The victims have been buried, and the injured have been sent to hospitals for treatment. Although there was also an emergency alarm on the 15th, no Japanese aircraft were found, so the market has gradually returned to normal on the 16th. Li Mingyang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Subei × Guerrilla Area, has donated 1,500 yuan to be distributed to the Red Swastika Society, the County Hospital, and the Gospel Hospital to help relieve the needs of the bombed people.</p>

<h3>He Qingru of the Vocational Education Society Reports: All Cities in the States Have Vocational Introduction Offices; School Teachers Help Graduates Find Jobs</h3>
<p>Educator Dr. He Qingru is currently in the United States researching vocational education. He previously recorded his research on secondary vocational education in the United States and sent it to various vocational education institutions in China for reference. The Chinese Vocational Education Society recently received a report from Mr. He on vocational guidance in the United States, which includes several points worth emulating. These are hereby published as a reference for those engaged in vocational introduction. All states in the United States have vocational introduction offices, located in major cities within the state. The state branches are directly under the central introduction office. The central and state governments share the cost of the state introduction offices equally, and the cities have no responsibility because the cities often have their own independent introduction offices that are unrelated to the state and city offices. The internal organization of each introduction office, in addition to the director and deputy director, is divided into two major sections: adults and youth. The adult section is further divided into labor, commerce, construction, and service groups according to the nature of the occupation (the types of occupations introduced are all described in detail and numbered in a special booklet). Each group has several interviewers who are responsible for contacting job opportunities, which are sought by the interviewers separately. In addition, there are several staff members in the office who are responsible for liaison. They visit various industrial organizations daily to promote opportunities. Those who need talent can be informed by the promoters to the interviewers of each group. In addition to visiting, the promoters are also responsible for various propaganda, such as newspapers and radio. The youth section cooperates very closely with the schools. Each year, in addition to the job introductions by the schools, the graduates are registered in the office to help them find jobs. The teachers of each subject in the school and the interviewers of the youth section are responsible for seeking opportunities. In addition to cooperating with the schools, they also have very close contact with the American Youth Administration, which is also responsible for youth placement. When job seekers arrive at the office, they are first received by the general receptionist, who asks about the type of job they are seeking and directs them to the appropriate group to wait to contact an interviewer. The registration form is filled out by the interviewer and then filed according to type. Therefore, one person can be listed in multiple occupations according to their training, experience, and interests, and they have a chance of being selected when there are opportunities. Employers mostly communicate by telephone, so there is a memorandum to record the essential details, such as the position, salary, and qualifications. Then, the information from the memorandum is copied into a formal job request form for reference. At the time of introduction, the most qualified registrants are selected, and several people are introduced for the employers to choose from. When sending registrants to contact, an introduction card is provided, along with a return card for the employers to decide whether to hire or not and send back to the office. According to the office's experience, introductions are more successful with smaller industrial organizations because larger organizations with complete structures often have their own personnel departments responsible for selecting and hiring, and do not need introduction agencies. This point is different from the situation in our country. The above is mostly for reference for vocational guidance work. It is hoped that those engaged in vocational introduction will pay more attention to it, and the establishment of public introduction agencies should be vigorously promoted.</p>
<h3>National Student Union Representatives to France to Attend World Student Union</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong, 20th Dispatch) Lu Qinzhi, representative of the National Student Union, said that after the student representative arrives in Hong Kong on the 22nd by French mail ship, they will travel to France on the same ship to attend the third International Conference of the World Student Union to be held in Nice in mid-August. At that time, they will also submit a proposal to the conference.</p>
<h3>Students Continue to Strike at Diocesan Boys' School in Hong Kong</h3>
<p>School Issues Final Notice</p>
<p>(Reuters, Hong Kong, 20th) The "political dispute" at Diocesan Boys' School, one of the oldest schools in Hong Kong, is now in a state of half-entertainment and half-anger. Several senior Chinese students are now on strike to protest the regular course exams. When the school's senior prefect is absent, Principal Goodbun has appointed a Taiwanese Chinese to temporarily serve as the senior prefect. Student representatives had previously discussed with Bishop Hall, Chairman of the school's committee, that if the school does not cancel this proposal, the students will strike. Although Principal Goodbun and Sir Kotewall, a leading Chinese resident of the city (Kotewall himself studied at the school), have repeatedly pleaded with the 120 striking students, three classes are now empty, most of whom are day students. Only 12 boarding students are absent. Goodbun has therefore issued a statement explaining that the appointment of the Taiwanese person is based solely on his personal qualifications, because the school's students come from as many as 20 or 30 countries. Therefore, he can only issue this in his personal capacity, and also said that boys of different nationalities in the school should continue their traditional habit of enhancing mutual understanding without questioning national policies. Even if the principal's approach is not popular, students must obey. The school has now issued a final notice limiting the striking students to return to school within a specified period.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match to Resume This Year; Hong Kong Team to Visit Shanghai in November; Shanghai Team to Visit Hong Kong Next Year on Lunar New Year's Day</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from Hong Kong) Regarding the news that the Shanghai-Hong Kong Interport Football Match will resume this year, as previously reported, we now have another message stating that because the Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match has been suspended for two years, it has been decided that two matches will be held consecutively, following the precedents of 1932 and 1933. The Hong Kong Football Association will send a team to Shanghai in November this year to compete, and the Shanghai Western Football Association will send a team to Hong Kong in February next year (Lunar New Year). At the same time, if the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation agrees, a team will be sent from the Philippines to Hong Kong in February next year to compete. In April, the Hong Kong Football Association will send a team to the Philippines in return. However, this matter is still under discussion. It can only be decided upon obtaining the agreement of both Hong Kong and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Another report states that last season's Hong Kong football matches saw considerable revenue due to crowded audiences, creating a new record in ten years. According to an official announcement from the Football Association, "The net profit from ticket sales for all championship matches last season, after deducting all expenses, was HK$7,448.70. Adding the current reserve of HK$4,637.18, the total is HK$12,085.98." The financial situation for the most recent seven years is listed as follows:</p>
<p>International Rules: To Be Modified</p>
<p>The Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Football Match has been suspended for two years due to the Sino-Japanese War. It is now known that the Shanghai Football Association and the Hong Kong Football Association are actively revising the rules of the Interport Football Match and have decided to resume the match this year.</p>
<p>The point of contention in the rules occurred several years ago, namely "Can Hong Kong team players who work in Guangzhou or Macau, but whose families reside in Hong Kong, still represent Hong Kong?" Another key point for the rule modification is the prohibition of naval personnel belonging to the Hong Kong Football League from participating in Interport matches. Hong Kong had previously drafted a rule addressing these two points and sent it to the Shanghai Football Association, but the matter was shelved due to the outbreak of war and the interruption of the Interport match.</p>
<p>Recently, in order to resume the matches as soon as possible, Shanghai has agreed to most of the points raised by Hong Kong, but Shanghai has also submitted several requests to Hong Kong for consideration. If Hong Kong adopts its suggestions, the Interport match will be changed according to the following articles: (1) The "Interport Cup" will be an annual contest between Hong Kong and Shanghai, with the competition venue rotating each year, one year in Hong Kong and one year in Shanghai. Other ports are not allowed to join.</p>
<p>(2) Players registered with and recognized by the Hong Kong and Shanghai Football Associations may participate in the competition. This provision will resolve the current residency issue in the rules. (3) Each team may not have more than three army or navy players participating. This also provides a solution to the issue of naval personnel being prohibited from participating.</p>
<p>In addition, an important change in the rules is the method of resolving ties in Interport matches. Shanghai has proposed that the match be extended for 30 minutes according to the rules. Hong Kong seems likely to accept this point, but many Hong Kong Football Association officials prefer an extension of 20 minutes.</p>
<p>The changes to the Interport rules must be implemented after both the Hong Kong and Shanghai Football Associations fully agree. It is expected that the two sides will be able to complete the modification of the rules before the start of the football season this year.</p>

Xu Duo, Yu Binqi, Lu Zhongqiu, Liang Jintang, Zhu Lianxiang, Li Guoxian, and Chen Linsheng have been hired as seven preparatory committee members. The first preparatory committee meeting was held at the association's clubhouse at 8 PM last night. As a result, it was resolved that the Jingwu Association would form its own table tennis team and invite the Mainland Cup champion Qingyun A to play a match. To increase the strength of the Jingwu team, it will invite veteran Lu Zhongqiu and former Shanghai champion Rong Dening to participate. The date is set for after next week, and the location is still being selected. The Jingwu team is already strong, and with the help of Lu and Rong Dening, it will be no less powerful than Qingyun A.

<h3>Finance: Cash Crunch; Gold Prices Decline Due to Exchange Rate Influence; Exchange Rate Arbitrage Available; Many Investors Taking Profits</h3>
<p>Yesterday's black market cash transactions suddenly reversed and declined. This was due to the recent cash shortage and the exchange market interest rates offering arbitrage opportunities. Many investors took profits. Additionally, securities firms started reselling, and several gold firms also released holdings. The prevailing sentiment was that the prices had risen too high, causing buyers to be cautious during the decline, resulting in an oversupply. Prices once fell to a low of 2,657 yuan before recovering slightly. Trading activity was brisk, with approximately 2,000 taels changing hands. Jewelry gold shops also quoted a small premium of three yuan. Customs gold and pure Sino-British gold remained stable. Today is the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, and the market is closed.</p>
<p>Spot Price Also Drops One Yuan</p>
<p>From the morning, the opening price per tael (ten liang) was initially lowered by 15 yuan due to securities firms' desire to sell and weak consumer demand. A gold firm (representing a foreign firm) sold 50 taels to another gold firm (representing a speculator) at a price of 2,685 yuan. Subsequently, a cash firm sold 50 taels to a jewelry firm at 83 yuan. At that time, the jewelry shops' buying appetite was still good, leading to an upward movement. The jewelry shops bought 50 taels from a securities firm at 87 yuan. Then, money changers bought 50 taels from a securities firm at 88 yuan. After that, a gold firm (representing a speculator) suddenly changed its mind and began to aggressively sell at high prices, leading to a decline. A gold firm sold 50 taels to a jewelry firm at 87 yuan, and then sold 50 taels to a money changer at 86 yuan. As buyers gradually thinned out, interest rates fell by 6 yuan. A gold firm sold 50 taels to a securities firm at 80 yuan, and then prices dropped another 10 yuan. Money changers aggressively sold to jewelry firms at 70 yuan, and then pushed the price down another 10 yuan. A securities firm sold 50 taels to a money changer at 60 yuan, and then dumped another 50 taels on the money changer, with the price falling to 57 yuan. As selling pressure eased and consumer demand picked up at the lower prices, the market stabilized, hovering around 60 yuan. Near noon, a gold firm sold 50 taels to a money changer at 60 yuan, which was the closing price for the morning. In the afternoon, the opening was flat. Initially, money changers bought 50 taels from a gold firm at 61 yuan. Later, money changers and jewelry firms successively absorbed more than 200 taels, leading to an upward movement. Money changers traded 50 taels at a high of 76 yuan. Shortly after, due to floating investors selling at high prices, prices immediately declined. A jewelry firm sold 50 taels to a money changer at 69 yuan, and a securities firm sold 50 taels to a money changer at 67 yuan. Later, a money changer came back to absorb supply, pushing the price back up 7 yuan. A money changer bought 50 taels from a cash firm at a price of 70 yuan. At the close of the day, a gold firm sold 50 taels to a money changer at a price of 2,660 yuan. As a result, the settlement price was 31 yuan lower than the previous day's. The spot price of the cash firm was 10 yuan higher than the spot price, while the current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. Inquiries revealed that few were opening new positions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Marked Up by a Small Three Yuan</p>
<p>The initial selling price of jewelry gold per tael at the beginning of the day remained at 273 yuan for major firms. At 10:05 AM, due to the weakness in spot prices, the price was marked up by a small three yuan. After that, prices varied slightly. Major firms revised the price to 270 yuan, while New Consolidated revised the price to 268 yuan, with a purchase price of 262 yuan.</p>
<p>Customs Pure Gold Remained Stable</p>
<p>According to a London report on the 19th, the price of British pure gold remained unchanged at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pence per ounce. As a result, the purchase price of Chinese cash at the Central Bank also remained fixed at 1,212.3 yuan. The listed customs gold remained flat at 2.396 yuan, and the Shanghai standard gold price remained unchanged at 1,207.6 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sassoon Aggressively Covered U.S. Dollar Futures; Though Settlement Volume Was Strong, Prices Ultimately Eased; Swap Arbitrage Decreased</h3>
<p>In the foreign exchange market, HSBC's exchange rate announcement remained unchanged. In the black market for British and American exchange rates, due to a slight easing in British-Japanese relations, the exchange rate between Britain and the United States saw a rebound. As a result, the market in this city opened with Britain flat and the United States slightly firmer. Although foreign firms continued to settle contracts in the middle of the day, the market was maintained because foreign firms were willing to cover. In addition, U.S. dollar telegrams came to sell, increasing foreign firms' coverage efforts. As a result, the market once hardened to 12.6875 yuan, before ending with Britain flat and the United States firmer by 0.03125. The situation in the futures market was quite tight at the morning opening. The July U.S. dollar once broke into the 12 yuan mark. Subsequently, a Western firm, Sassoon, suddenly aggressively covered US dollar futures for June and July to the tune of 600,000 yuan, causing the market to become looser. In the end, prices recovered slightly. Swap arbitrage for spot contracts this month was at 3.5 points, while for June to July it was about 0.278 points, with a premium of about 0.04 points. The number of arbitrageurs decreased sharply, with most trading in futures. The Hong Kong dollar remained stable due to balanced supply and demand. Today is the Dragon Boat Festival, and the market is closed.</p>
<p>U.S. Dollar Futures to Reach 12 Yuan</p>
<p>In the early morning, London's prices for near and far contracts both contracted by 0.0625. The New York silver price was fixed, and the London gold price remained unchanged. The exchange rate for Britain against the United States was up 1 pence, while for Shanghai it remained flat. The exchange rate for France was up 2 centimes. The U.S. dollar was up 0.0625 against Britain, up 1 cent against Shanghai, and up 0.0625 against France. The Central Bank's listed rates for various currencies remained the same. At the morning opening, the banks' selling price for spot contracts was 6.5 pence for the British pound and 12.65625 yuan for the U.S. dollar, up 0.03125 from the previous close, with Britain flat and the United States firmer, due to the rebound in the exchange rate between Britain and the United States. The banks' selling price for futures contracts was 6.3125 pence for the British pound and 12.3125 yuan for the U.S. dollar for the current month, and only 6.0625 pence for the British pound and only 11.875 yuan for the U.S. dollar for July. The banks' buying price was 0.125 pence different for the British pound and 0.25 yuan different for the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the futures market remained quite tight. At that time, foreign firms first came to settle contracts, with HSBC and McCallie settling contracts for spot British pounds at 6.5 pence. Subsequently, they also settled contracts for spot U.S. dollars from foreign telegrams and American banks at 12.65625 yuan and 6875 yuan. The situation was slightly firmer for Britain and the United States. When HSBC announced the exchange rates, they did not change. When the silver balance tax was announced to continue at a small 0.025, totaling a slight 2.75%, the Western firm Sassoon suddenly aggressively covered U.S. dollar futures, and other banks also slightly increased their willingness to sell, causing the situation to immediately loosen. Sassoon and American banks successively sold contracts for the current month's U.S. dollar to Chinese banks, hardening prices from 12.4375 yuan to 0.5 yuan. Then, Sassoon sold July U.S. dollar contracts to Yuli (representing the First Bank of Japan) and other foreign firms, hardening prices from 12.1875 yuan to 0.25 yuan. Near the noon close, Western firm Sassoon's willingness to sell faded, and futures prices trended softer again. At that time, foreign firms came back to absorb supply. The spot price for the Hong Kong dollar remained at 43.75 yuan, with supply from Chinese banks in Guangdong and foreign banks in the Netherlands. Until the noon close, the banks' selling prices for spot contracts were 6.5 pence for the British pound and 12.65625 yuan for the U.S. dollar, the same as at the morning opening. The British pound was 6.375 pence and the U.S. dollar was 12.4375 yuan for the current month, and the British pound was 6.1875 pence and the U.S. dollar was 12.0625 yuan for July.</p>
<p>Spot Prices Closed with Britain Flat and the United States Higher</p>
<p>In the afternoon, foreign firms continued to settle spot contracts for British pounds at 6.5 pence. Subsequently, they settled spot contracts for U.S. dollars from American banks at 12.65625 yuan. After entering the market, Chinese bank Zhongnan sold spot U.S. dollars to local Shanghai banks at 12.625 yuan. Later, the Netherlands' Anda sold spot Hong Kong dollars to foreign firms at 43.875 yuan and 75 yuan. The situation was largely unchanged. Until the late close, the banks' selling prices for spot contracts were 6.5 pence for the British pound and 12.65625 yuan for the U.S. dollar. The British pound was 6.375 pence and the U.S. dollar was 12.4375 yuan for the current month, and the British pound was 6.1875 pence and the U.S. dollar was 12.0625 yuan for July, which were similar to the noon close. As a result, compared to yesterday's spot prices, Britain was flat and the United States was up 0.03125. Britain was flat and the United States was also firmer by 0.0625 for June, while Britain was firmer by 0.03125 and the United States was looser by 0.0625 for July.

<p>Hong Kong Exchange Market Remained Stable</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 20th - This morning, the exchange market opened with stable conditions. Compared with yesterday's prices, the British pound forward rate contracted by 0.03125 and the Shanghai dollar spot rate contracted by 1 yuan. The rest remained flat. At 10:20 AM, the U.S. dollar forward rate tightened, shrinking by 0.0625 to 28.6875 yuan. However, at 11:30 AM, it expanded back to the original rate at the morning opening. At the same time, the Shanghai dollar contracted by half a yuan to 227.5 yuan. The market continued to contract by half a yuan at the afternoon opening at 2:30 PM, to 227 yuan.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Jumps Wildly, Reaching 70 Yuan; Call Loan Interest Rate Revised to 25%</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for remittances and drafts continued its wild climb. This was due to increasingly tight money conditions and the approach of the Dragon Boat Festival, leading to a shortage of cash in the market. Those in need were eager to obtain funds, willing to pay high discount rates. Consequently, the discount rate per thousand yuan reached 64 yuan in the morning and soared to a final high of 70 yuan in the afternoon, a jump of over 16 yuan compared to the previous day. The call loan interest rate of the Money Trade Association was also raised by another 3%, to 25%, it is said.</p>
<p>Foreign Currencies Mostly Decline</p>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold remained unchanged. The exchange rate between British and American currencies rose by .0625. Foreign exchange banks in the local area were very active in settling accounts, and foreign banks provided smooth settlements, keeping market prices stable. Early in the day, the forward rate for British currency showed signs of easing, and gold shop customers emerged in large numbers, pushing the market price down to 15 yuan. Later, securities firms and others, taking profits, offered to sell, causing the market to decline. The tense situation of the previous day suddenly dissipated. In the afternoon, the market showed a recovery, with currency exchange businesses actively buying for their customers, while the supply was not abundant, causing prices to rise gradually. The market closed at 2669 yuan, a decrease of 31 yuan compared to the previous day. Foreign currencies, including British and American gold pounds, fell due to the cessation of the rise in the forward rate. The increased supply weakened market prices. British and American gold notes fell as the forward rate for British currency eased, and the near-term rate for American currency eased by .03125. Transactions were very active, and market prices declined accordingly. Hong Kong dollars, French francs, and Annam piasters all showed signs of easing due to the weak market conditions. The market for Japanese gold notes was stable, closing at 1.001 yuan. Korean currency was at .862 yuan. Trading by the association had not yet opened. Yesterday's market prices were as follows: British gold pounds down 5 jiao, British gold notes down 7 jiao, American gold pounds down 7 jiao, American gold notes down .045 yuan, Hong Kong dollars down 2 fen, French francs down 1 li, Singapore dollars down 1 fen, Annam piasters down 4 fen, Canadian dollars and Philippine pesos each down 5 fen, Australian gold notes down 1 jiao, and other currencies unchanged.</p>
<p>Large Silver Bars Increasingly Weak; Indian Silver Continues to Decline</p>
<p>London, 19th: Speculators in the silver market were hesitant. Offerings from India were somewhat weak, lacking support. The market was flat and weak, closing with a soft tone. Sellers were offering at .0625 below the listed price, while buyers were bidding .125 below. Both near and forward-term large silver bars were down .0625. New York silver report: American spot prices remained unchanged. Also, a report from Bombay indicated that the Indian silver market remained weak, with both spot and forward-term prices continuing to fall by 3 annas. A total of 40 transactions were recorded, it is said.</p>
<h3>Securities: Decline in Domestic and Foreign Bonds Unabated; Unified Bonds Each Approach the 50-60 Yuan Mark; London Foreign Bond Market Almost Universally Down; The Foreign Stock Market Appears Desolate and Bleak</h3>
<p>The securities gray market saw very dramatic market fluctuations yesterday. Small individual investors remained extremely panicked. Although large investors and the financial sector did some buying, initially pushing prices up by one yuan, continued selling by floating speculators caused prices to fall slightly. Category A bonds broke through the 60-yuan mark, and the rest broke through the 50-yuan mark, without being able to stabilize. Investor sentiment was weak, and a rebound was unlikely until news became clearer. The reported news has not yet been confirmed as definitive. What is most confusing is that the wording in the telegrams is ambiguous. It is said that, for the sake of uniformity between domestic and foreign bonds, it is necessary to suspend interest and principal payments on domestic bonds as well, hence the Reuters telegram. However, news circulating from the financial sector indicates that each public bond will continue to be drawn as usual. Even though principal and interest are not repaid, the principal and interest can still be discounted at banks, so the actual loss is very limited. Therefore, after the close, market prices secretly improved slightly, by a few jiao to one yuan. It is said that Chongqing will remit the interest and principal to Shanghai, discounted at 85%. Yesterday, only one morning session of trading took place, with a total transaction volume of approximately 2 million yuan. There was no shortage of financial institutions buying, such as Xinfu, Xingyuan, Tongshun, and Number Four. At the opening, prices briefly rebounded by one to one and a few jiao, but due to selling by small investors, the selling pressure remained extremely strong. Lianhe further fueled the decline. Numbers 20 and Xingyu also sold more than they bought, causing the market price to fall sharply. Category A bonds broke through the 60-yuan mark, falling to within 57 yuan. Categories B, C, D, and E also broke through the 50-yuan mark, falling by another 1.6 to 3.3 yuan. However, after the close, because Yuanda 号 absorbed a large quantity, market prices rose again by about one yuan. A summary table is listed below.</p>
<p>London Chinese Foreign Bonds, quoted on Monday, the 19th of this month, all declined. The Guangdong-Kowloon Railway bond fell sharply by 3 pounds, to 15 pounds. The Longhai Railway (with stamp) fell by 2.5 pounds, also to 15 pounds. The Hukuang (German and French, with stamp) and the Beijing-Shanghai Railway bonds each fell by 2 pounds, the former to 16 pounds and the latter to 20 pounds. The Vickers bond fell by 1.5 pounds, to 13.5 pounds. The Reorganization Loan (British and French) and the Daqing Railway bonds each fell by .5 pounds, the former to 38.5 pounds and the latter to 18 pounds. The remaining bonds each fell by 1 pound (see the market price table for prices). British real goods for sale included 2,000 pounds each of the Reorganization Loan and the German and French stamped bonds, totaling 4,000 pounds. The selling price was 34.5 pounds each, a discount of 4 pounds from the British and French listed price.</p>
<p>In stock trading, 50 shares of the Zhongyi Trust Company were traded at a price of 8.75 yuan. The stock market of the Public Industry Association was weak throughout the day due to panic among investors. It seems difficult to return to normal for a while, and it will be necessary to wait until the Tianjin issue is resolved. The declines of various well-known stocks since the opening are listed below.</p>
<p>London British Far East companies' stocks, quoted on Monday, the 19th of this month, showed mixed trends. Both the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation shares rose. The British-registered shares rose by 2 pounds, to 80 pounds. The Hong Kong-registered shares rose by .5 pound, to 81.5 pounds. The Mercantile Bank shares continued to fall by 2 shillings and 6 pence, to 7 pounds 2 shillings and 6 pence. The Kailan Mining Administration shares continued to fall by 6 pence, to 18 shillings and 6 pence. The rest were unchanged.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn: Outside Interests Eager to Hoard; The Yarn Market Feels Increasingly Unpredictable; The Afternoon Market Will Be Temporarily Suspended Starting Next Month; Factory Openings Also Include Over 2,000 Bales</h3>
<p>The yarn market is slightly mediocre, and the trend is still 常 忽靡常, sometimes up and sometimes down, making it very difficult to grasp. The general sentiment remains optimistic, but prices have already entered a high range. Gold shops and securities firms have hoarded large quantities of cotton yarn, providing strong support. Some wealthy individuals are even selling public bonds and switching to cotton yarn, which makes the market even stronger, increasing the number of chips traded on the table. At the same time, factories are opening up to meet demand. Also, the existing yarn market will be closed tomorrow, as usual, for a holiday. Business will resume as usual on the 22nd. It is also heard that the weather has been very hot lately, and the meeting places are narrow. It is proposed that the afternoon market be temporarily suspended from July 1st, to be restored to its original state when the weather turns cooler, it is said.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the existing yarn market was reported to have a group of bulls making moves. 20-count double-strand yarn was bid at 3 yuan above the spot price, with 10 bales purchased at 510 yuan. Warehouse receipts were also offered at 502 yuan. However, the customer groups showed no response. Shortly after, it was heard that foreign exchange was unchanged, and gold retreated. In an instant, a wave of selling arose, and market prices gradually declined. 20-count Double Horse spot yarn fell to 502 yuan, and warehouse receipt prices were at 493 yuan. Subsequently, because the South China customer groups were uninterested in coarse yarn, and prices were high, investor sentiment was affected. Someone slightly pulled up the price and purchased a few bales. By the closing price, spot was at 503.5 yuan, and warehouse receipts were at 496 yuan. The afternoon session opened flat, and then the bulls re-entered with dozens of bales, creating another impression of strength and rising prices. However, customer group trading was not active, and prices fell again. The closing price for 20-count Double Horse yarn at the foreign warehouse was 504 yuan, and warehouse receipts were at 495 yuan. In the end, the various customer groups bought a total of 4,250 bales. Prices for 20-count Double Horse yarn fell by 2 yuan, Shepherd fell by 7.5 yuan, Five Blessings fell by 5 yuan, Double Earth remained unchanged, and 32-count yarn fell by 5 yuan. However, 10-count coarse yarn rose by 5 yuan. Shenxin Factory opened 600 bales of 20-count Tiannv yarn at a price of 510 yuan, for delivery in August and September. Xinsheng Factory opened 200 bales of 6-count Red Wanzi yarn at a price of 260 yuan, and 200 bales of 7-count Red Wanzi yarn at a price of 340 yuan, for delivery from July to September. Chongxin Factory opened 300 bales of 20-count Dafa yarn at a price of 455 yuan, and 60 bales of 10-count Dafa yarn at a price of called by 112 yuan. Yong'an Factory opened 800 bales of 20-count Special Golden City yarn at a price of 505 yuan to 515 yuan, for delivery in June and July, with a deposit of 60 yuan per bale. The amounts purchased by each customer group are listed below.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market is increasingly showing a state of indecision. Because of sluggish real demand in the morning, 20-count Yueqin yarn for this month fell to a closing price of 417 yuan. In addition, the remittance discount rate has risen sharply, leading to a flat close in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Indian Cotton Plummets; Traders Order 8,000 Bales</h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Prices: The New York cotton market was very quiet at the opening this morning. Prices fell because of sales by Bombay groups and the softness of Liverpool prices. The issue of agricultural relief funds in Washington has not yet been resolved. However, it is generally expected that it will be passed by the weekend. As a result, traders are generally taking a wait-and-see attitude. Later, cotton prices rose due to poor weather in the central cotton region, high prices in New Orleans, and increased yarn sales, leading to a shortage of spot goods. At the close, prices rose by 4-5 points compared to the previous day. Indian cotton has fallen sharply recently by over 3 rupees due to the deteriorating situation in the Far East. Egyptian cotton rose by 5-6 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Traders have had no transactions since the Shanghai exchange rate changed on the 7th of this month due to price discrepancies. However, recently, traders have almost sold out of their existing goods, and the selling price on the market is almost equal to the prices set by foreign firms. Yesterday, Indian cotton plummeted, and the converted price was very close. Traders inquired about prices from foreign firms, and traders' orders reached over 8,000 bales yesterday, most of which was West Indian cotton.</p>
<p>There was a slight business in local cotton, but the amount was very small. Only Huashang Xinyu Factory bought 100 bales, and Tonghang bought 70 bales of used cotton. The Indian cotton transactions of other traders were less significant, not as prosperous as before. Japanese factories also had no interest. 197 bales from the Subei source arrived in Tongzhou. The situation of existing cotton is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Accelerating the Price Increase; Cloth Factories Require Full Remittance Head</h3>
<p>Dyeing and Weaving Factories Specialize in East Asian Goods</p>
<p>The domestic cloth market was calm yesterday. Stocking holders' buying intentions eased slightly due to the tightening supply of cash. Yihua Factory increased the price of coarse cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao, and opened over 1,000 pieces of six-seven month futures. The Luo Shi market stabilized. Chinese factories also opened for sale of fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse twill, but with open prices too high, requiring an increase of 2.5 jiao to 5 jiao per piece compared to the market, cooling traders' buying intentions and reducing transactions. With the discount rate for cash remittances rising, each Chinese factory is changing the practice of a 30% remittance and 70% "remittance head" (extra fee) to requiring full "remittance head" for shipments. Among actual sales, colored twill is the best seller, with the Guangdong and Zhejiang groups actively purchasing. Dyeing factories in the local area continued to purchase approximately 400 bales of plain colored twill fabric from this factory yesterday, with prices rising by 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao per piece. Other goods were flat. Yihua coarse cloth was sold in approximately 300 bales to wholesale stores on the street and traders, with heavy-weight canvas being the best-selling. Shipping to Fuzhou, Fujian has resumed, and customer groups are preparing to ship their inventory within days. The Yunnan group's demand has shown signs of recovery, with over 100 bales of fine twill, coarse cloth, fine cloth, colored cloth, colored twill, printed cloth, and satin being transacted, totaling over 3,000 pieces.</p>
<p>East Asian Piece Goods</p>
<p>Yesterday, white goods sales were strong for spot fine cloth, with futures rising by 5 fen to 1 jiao per piece. Fine twill rose uniformly by 1 jiao to 2 jiao, especially for under-grade Baobei and Shuangyu brand dyed blanks. Demand on this street was the strongest. 12-pound Longtou fine cloth spot goods still sold for 15 yuan, and for the next month, 15.35 yuan. However, traders' buying intentions were slightly sluggish due to the impact of the rising spot water for cash remittances. Nevertheless, the total number of fine cloth and fine twill transacted on this street throughout the day still reached approximately 1,000 pieces.</p>
<h3>The Unsuitability of Rayon Woolen Fabric</h3>
<p>— (Shi)</p>
<p>In the Shanghai woolen fabric market, British goods used to dominate. In recent years, East Asian woolen fabrics have been extremely popular. At the beginning of the war, there were many arrivals (mostly untaxed). By the end of last year, imports continued to decrease. The main reasons are: (1) It is increasingly difficult to obtain foreign exchange; (2) The economy is turning difficult, and the textile fabrics must be mixed with rayon wool, which we are not allowed to export; (3) Smuggling is not as smooth as before. If you want to buy foreign exchange, you must contact Westerners or Chinese to be successful. It is quite difficult for Japanese firms to directly transport and sell goods from Hong Kong to Shanghai (the number of Chinese and Westerners being used by them is now small due to the change in the situation in China.) Also, because of the goods arriving in recent years, eight or nine out of ten are mixed with rayon wool, the reputation has been lost, and sales have decreased greatly.</p>
<p>Rayon wool fabrics are extremely uncomfortable to wear. It is the only product of a certain country, which other countries' merchants are unwilling to do. The texture is softer than Western goods, the price is cheaper and the colors are better, and it is quite difficult for non-experts to distinguish. When making clothes, the fabric will fluff up in ten days or half a month. When washing, even using both hands to wash too hard will cause the fabric to break, let alone using a washboard. A test can also be conducted on the spot: first cut a small sample from the store, put it in water or tear it with your mouth, pull it with two fingers, and seven or eight out of ten are as brittle as paper. The brittleness is slightly less after ironing dry. Therefore, friends who know how to calculate, if they don't wear woolen fabrics, would rather buy fabrics from dismantling traders who specialize in selling sample version fabrics, because they are all Western goods, the price is more expensive but more durable. Honestly speaking, three pieces of rayon woolen clothing are not as durable as one piece of high-quality British wool. However, dismantling stores mostly sell double-width yardsticks. Those with slightly more money can make two pieces of clothing on their own, otherwise, they can buy with friends, which is more cost-effective. Don't spend more than one yuan per foot to buy inferior rayon wool goods. If you can't afford British goods, it's better to buy genuine domestic goods (be aware that there are also counterfeit domestic goods). The selling price is not expensive, and the goods are authentic. If you want to be trendy, then that's your bad luck. But Shanghai's male and female customers only care about appearance, so how can they take care of this?</p>
<h3>Raincoat Fabric in the Rainy Season</h3>
<p>Raincoat cloth mold makes it prosperous, and the selling season has now arrived. Western goods, due to the high cost of foreign exchange, such as single-sided open water goods, have risen sharply from 7.78 yuan to 9.23 yuan, and the market price per yard has also jumped from 8.5 yuan to 9.25 yuan. East Asian goods are lacking in the port, and the market price has also risen. Yesterday, first-class double-sided yarn raincoat cloth was wholesaled at 2.5 yuan per yard, second-class at 2.5 yuan, Baobelin sold at 2.75 yuan, and British-made all sold at 7.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: When Will Stocking Holders Stop Buying Rice?; Foreign Firms Peddling Saigon Rice; The Rice Market Will Be Closed for Two Days</h3>
<p>Du Geng: After the market once turned flat before, it was still sluggish yesterday morning. However, because of the Dragon Boat Festival, the market will be closed for two days today and tomorrow, and many stores on the street added purchases, and stocking holders also made moves, so the situation became tight again in an instant. In addition, the sources from all roads are still sparse, only six or seven hundred bags arrived from Changzhou. The sellers' thoughts are quite firm, and the shouting is fierce. However, although the price of thick and thin geng rice has increased, it is not as much as in the previous few days, only a difference of 3 jiao.</p>
<p>Bian Yuan: Few people ask, the market color is still sluggish.</p>
<p>Ke Xian: Yesterday, both the ke market and stocking were quiet, and the market surface was originally stable. However, because this street will be closed for two days today and tomorrow, everyone bought before the festival, and the market price of ke xian rice rose together with the jingjian rice, rising 2 jiao more than the previous day. The number of transactions also increased to five or six thousand bags. However, the price has reached its peak, and people are not too optimistic. Du Yangjian and Bu Kejian followed the rise, varying from 2 to 3 jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: 300 bags of spot goods opened yesterday. Saigon Number One was priced as high as 23 yuan, because there are only a few thousand bags of foreign rice stored in Shanghai, so the market is easy to rise and difficult to fall. However, yesterday, Huashang Jianyuan and foreign firms peddled Saigon Number Two rice, which was only 22.6 yuan per original bag, equivalent to just over 18 yuan per shi in the market. Although the firm did not dare to do much because the price was too high, it was heard that a telegram had been sent out, and if it can become a reality, it will be beneficial to the future of people's food.</p>
<h3>New Wheat Arriving Vigorously; Flour Prices Rising</h3>
<p>This Batch Has Been Changed to 4.65 Yuan Cash; Over 16,500 Tons of Australian Wheat Arrived</p>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the market price of factory flour was raised again, because since the price of rice has been rising, it has attracted the attention of stocking holders inside and outside the industry. The local customer sales market has become active in recent days, and everyone has the intention to buy for stocking due to the Dragon Boat Festival holiday. However, the factory believes that prices must still be seen as high, and in order to prevent stocking holders from manipulating the market, they are still unwilling to supply as much as possible, so the customer board still holds back from opening, and at the same time the wholesale price on this street has been raised again, changed to 4.65 yuan in cash, which is good because the remittance discount rate has been very high recently, and the factory has changed to selling in cash. The total transactions included nearly 10,000 bags of local street retail and 20,000 to 30,000 bags of customer sales, mostly re-circulated goods being traded among themselves, and the market seemed very good.</p>
<p>Wheat: The source of new wheat has gradually become vigorous in the past few days. Nanjing, Puzhen, Danyang, Suzhou, Kunshan and other places have already been listed one after another. At a time when flour prices are rising, those who hold goods all want to see high prices. However, factory demand has not yet started, relying only on the attention of street and firm stocking holders. Yesterday it was heard that the wheat price in Danyang and Suzhou opened at 7.03 yuan, the wheat price in Suiting opened at 7 yuan, and the wheat price in Kunshan opened at 6.85 yuan. The total number of transactions was 13 or 14 cars, all of which were purchased by local customer stocking holders, and the market price rose by several points to a jiao.</p>
<p>Foreign Wheat: Constantly arriving in Shanghai. The other day, the Anglo Indian, managed by the manager of Tianxiang Foreign Firm, carried over 8,000 tons of wheat from Australia. After arriving at the Wusongkou, because there was no gap in the Pudong River pontoon wharf, it temporarily anchored outside the mouth to wait, and it will take about a week before it can be imported. Yesterday, the company had another Mount Taurns with more than 8,500 tons of foreign wheat, and just happened to have the twelfth and thirteenth pontoons available for berthing, so it imported in the afternoon, fearing a rush of lighterage, and it was heard that it would be moved to the thirteenth and fourteenth pontoons two days later for unloading.</p>

<h3>Abundant Funds, Stable Market; All Industries Pass the Dragon Boat Festival Safely; Silver and Money Industry and Market Closed Today; Citizens Decorate the Festival, Unable to Escape Tradition</h3>
<p>Today is the accounting period for the Dragon Boat Festival, and the silver and money industry and various industry markets are closed. The financial market is as stable as ever, and all industries are sure to pass the Dragon Boat Festival safely. However, because of abundant funds, speculation is booming, creating soaring prices and distorted development of various industries. Details are noted below.</p>
<p>Abundant Funds; Financial Stability</p>
<p>Since the China, Central, Communications, and Agricultural four banks and the Silver and Money Industries Joint Reserve Depository have been making every effort to adjust and maintain Shanghai's financial market, it has remained as stable as ever. However, due to the massive influx of funds from the war zone, the current deposits of the silver and money industries have surged, and Shanghai's funds have gradually felt abundant, but there is a lack of proper use, creating a boom in speculative business. From foreign exchange arbitrage and buying and selling of foreign currency, red gold, and stocks to hoarding various commodities and renting and building real estate and houses, it is more prosperous than before the war. As a result, prices in the concessions are soaring and the distorted development of industry is running counter to the government's wartime financial policies.</p>
<p>Distorted Development; All Industries Pass Safely</p>
<p>All industries have been able to obtain considerable profits due to distorted development after the war, so the accounts released during the Dragon Boat Festival have all been able to be recovered on schedule. At the same time, firms and stores' loans to various industries have also been able to be paid off clearly, so this year's Dragon Boat Festival is very different from previous years. No unfortunate events have occurred, and there is no problem for all industries to pass the Dragon Boat Festival safely. However, although the call loan interest rate in the money market rose to 25 jiao yesterday, this is a phenomenon that must occur every year during the Dragon Boat Festival, because it is at the time when spring tea, new cocoons, wheat and other agricultural products are listed, and various industries need money to try to buy. The slight rise in foreign short term is in the cleaning. 1</p>
<p>Utilizing Funds; Moving to the Mainland</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the financial sector yesterday that the financial industry is increasingly turning to speculation to make profits because of the difficulty of fund utilization. It is heard that the government will correct this, hoping that the financial sector will move funds inland, develop the southwest, and not engage in speculative business. It is heard that some financial circles have already studied how to utilize the surplus funds in Shanghai, focusing on the development of the southwest. At the same time, Shanghai, Xinhua, Jin Cheng, Zhe Xing, Zhe Shi, and other banks have actively started to add branches in the mainland in order to transfer surplus funds to the mainland, so speculation in Shanghai may decrease thereafter.</p>
<p>Citizens Decorate; As Before</p>
<p>Today is the old Dragon Boat Festival, and the residents of Shanghai have been unable to escape tradition, and have decorated quite a bit. The market is full of calamus and mugwort, and rice dumplings are almost a must-have for households. Liquors are seen to be selling a lot, and some halls hang Zhong Kui's ghost-catching picture to drive away evil spirits. In various ways, no one is second, but recently, due to rising prices, the cost of a feast is quite considerable, so it is not easy for residents to arrange the festival.</p>
<h3>Ding Geller Dies Tragically: Responsibility Determined; Death Caused by Neglect After Being Stabbed in the Abdomen by Japanese Soldiers: Verdict of the British Coroner</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, the British court this morning (the 20th) concluded the inquest into the death of Mr. Ding Geller, supervisor of the Lun Chang Textile Factory. Before delivering the verdict, Coroner Hayes severely criticized the Japanese naval landing party soldiers for their unnecessary and inappropriate actions after disarming Mr. Ding, stabbing and injuring him with a bayonet. Mr. Hayes stated regarding the evidence presented, "I do not wish to summarize all the evidence, only to offer some criticism. The evidence I have heard is the clearest and most egregious case I have ever seen."</p>
<p>The Coroner</p>
<p>Emphasizes Key Points</p>
<p>Mr. Ding was stabbed unnecessarily and inappropriately after being disarmed. Mr. Ding was injured on June 6th at the Lun Chang Textile Factory by individuals outside the jurisdiction of this court, and died on June 7th at the Country Hospital. His death was caused by the abdominal stab wound, intestinal perforation, shock, and blood loss. The failure to</p>
<p>Perform Immediate Surgery</p>
<p>further contributed to his inevitable death. Soldiers scaled the wall from adjacent land into the Lun Chang factory grounds and opened the main gate, allowing thirty strikers to enter. Mr. Ding attempted to stop them and was beaten by Japanese naval landing party soldiers and stabbed with a bayonet. Mr. Ding and two other British employees in the factory, seeing the approaching strikers carrying large sticks, took out handguns. Mr. Ding then waved his handgun at the approaching Japanese soldiers in a threatening manner, ordering them out of the factory. His colleagues calmed him down and were leading him back to the factory office when he was surrounded by Japanese soldiers. The Japanese soldiers knocked the gun from Mr. Ding's hand and began striking him with their rifle butts and stabbing him with their bayonets. Shortly thereafter, Major Noji, commander of the Japanese naval landing party in Pudong, arrived on the scene. At this time, Mr. Ding had managed to stand up and was able to walk unsteadily. Unexpectedly,</p>
<p>He Was Again Assaulted</p>
<p>by the Japanese soldiers. Major Noji then approached Mr. Ding and began striking him on the shoulders and head with his sword scabbard. Mr. Ding was soon dragged to the Japanese hospital in Pudong, where his wounds received superficial treatment, and he was detained there for an entire day, until 10 PM, when the British Consulate-General was notified of his serious injuries. Mr. Thomson of the British Consulate-General, accompanied by a foreign doctor, went to Pudong and had Mr. Ding transported to the Country Hospital, where he died at 5:30 AM the following morning.</p>
<h3>Two British Warships Weigh Anchor and Depart</h3>
<p>Cruiser "Cornwall" Sails to Qingdao</p>
<p>Flagship "Scorpion" Sails to the Yangtze River</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the British light cruiser HMS Cornwall, which had been docked at the British naval pontoon in Shanghai for ten days, weighed anchor and sailed to Qingdao yesterday (the 19th) at dawn. British naval authorities in Shanghai stated that the ship's departure was a routine movement. At almost the same time, the British Yangtze River Fleet flagship HMS Scorpion, carrying Rear Admiral Holt, sailed down the Huangpu River towards the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. After the HMS Cornwall departed, the British pontoon was immediately occupied by the British destroyer HMS Dainty.</p>
<h3>Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance Strictly Prevents Income Tax Evasion; Tax Collection Agencies May Assess a Capital Amount of 2,000 Yuan for Taxation Based on the Average Turnover Rate</h3>
<p>The Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance stipulates that the first category of profit-seeking enterprises is subject to income tax only if the capital is above 2,000 yuan and the net profit is above 5% of the capital. The original intention of this legislation was to provide relief for small businesses and avoid imposing excessive taxes on them. However, since its implementation, a small number of unscrupulous merchants have deliberately underreported their capital as less than 2,000 yuan in an attempt to evade taxes. Now, a remedial measure has been formulated, and the original order is recorded below:</p>
<p>Exploiting Restrictions, Deliberately Underreporting</p>
<p>It has been found that merchants subject to the income tax on the first category of profit-seeking enterprises often exploit the 2,000-yuan capital restriction, deliberately underreporting their capital in an attempt to evade taxes. The methods of underreporting include creating false records in the accounts showing capital of less than 2,000 yuan, or reclassifying part of the capital as received deposits or accumulated surplus, in order to ensure that the capital does not reach the 2,000-yuan threshold. Their fraudulent techniques are quite ingenious, and even with thorough auditing, it is sometimes difficult to detect.</p>
<p>Affecting National Revenue is Indeed Not Insignificant</p>
<p>If a remedial measure is not formulated, the impact on national revenue will be significant. According to the revenue statistics for various industries in the 26th year of the Republic (1937) compiled by this office, the average capital turnover rate is often five times. The profitability of capital should not be viewed solely based on the static amount of capital but should also consider the dynamic rate of capital turnover. Even if the book capital is less than 2,000 yuan, if the business volume and net profit are inconsistent with the general ratio of the industry, then the reported capital is not entirely accurate. To prevent clever tax evasion and ensure fairness, this office has</p>
<p>Adopted Regulations, Levying Taxes According to Rates</p>
<p>In accordance with Article 12 of the Provisional Regulations and Interpretation Order No. 44, tax collection agencies may, based on the business situation and the average capital turnover rate of the industry in the previous year, directly determine the capital amount to be 2,000 yuan and levy taxes according to rates, in order to prevent tax evasion and increase resources for the war effort. In addition to reporting to the Ministry for record-keeping and issuing separate orders to various departments and sub-departments, this order is issued to the relevant department to ensure compliance and diligent tax collection.</p>
<h3>Prices of Various Industries Continue to Rise, the Lives of Ordinary People are Increasingly Difficult; Ordinary Restaurants Raise Prices by 10% to 20%, Unable to Provide Change, and Change Money Codes to Foreign Codes</h3>
<p>Since the tightening of foreign exchange controls, the prices of various imported goods have soared. Moreover, unscrupulous merchants have taken the opportunity to raise the prices of essential domestic goods such as rice and firewood. Therefore, ordinary restaurants in the city also raised prices for food and drinks yesterday, by 10% to 20%. Furthermore, due to the shortage of copper coins, it is impossible to provide change, so change money codes have been changed to foreign codes, which has a significant impact on the lives of ordinary people. As for other industries, the following announced price increases yesterday: (1) Shanghai Coal Dealers, (2) Mobil Oil, (3) Asiatic Petroleum, (4) Continental Wire Factory, (5) Da Guangming Machine-Made Glass Factory, (6) Yu Feng Soap Factory, (7) Ming Hua Towel Factory, (8) Jing Cheng Glass Factory, (9) Mei Sheng Chemical Factory, (10) Xin Sheng Machine-Made Button Factory, (11) Hong Yu Partridge Dishes, (12) Alcohol Manufacturing Joint Association, (13) Electrical Silk Weaving Industry, (14) Machine Dyeing and Weaving Industry, (15) Yong Hua Hardware Factory, (16) Mei Xin Bakelite Factory, etc. The average increase ranged from 10% to 30%, which poses a serious threat to the livelihoods of ordinary people. Therefore, all sectors deeply hope that the concession authorities will quickly implement effective measures to curb this trend, so as to avoid affecting the stability of social order.</p>
<h3>A Meaningful Pamphlet: "America's Disgrace"; Americans Condemn Arms Shipments to Japan; Shanghai Has Received This Pamphlet</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, a new pamphlet is circulating in the United States, stating that American merchants shipping war materials to Japan is "America's Disgrace", and urging an embargo on Japan, supporting Thomas's amendment to the Neutrality Act, and criticizing the United States as an accomplice to Japanese aggression. Shanghai has also received this pamphlet. A portion of the full text states that China is fighting to maintain its national independence, which has aroused worldwide sympathy and assistance from the people of democratic countries. Our country (referring to the United States below)</p>
<p>Extends Credit Loans</p>
<p>to China, which is evidence of this sympathy. However, despite this action, in the eyes of the world, our country is still considered an accomplice to Japanese aggression. Facts show that the United States is guilty. This cannot be concealed by the fact that Americans resent fascist aggression and have conclusive evidence. The supplies provided by the United States to the Japanese army include: (1) 100% of the gasoline, used to power the motors of its combat weapons, (2) 93% of the copper, used to manufacture bullets, (3) 91% of the trucks, which are motorized</p>
<p>Transportation Equipment</p>
<p>(4) 60% of the kerosene, (5) 41% of the pig iron, used to manufacture cannons, (6) 48% of the machinery, used to manufacture munitions, and (7) 60% of the scrap iron, used to manufacture bombs and shells, wantonly slaughtering people. In addition to providing deadly military equipment to the Japanese aggressors, the United States also purchases Japanese goods, providing this war-crazed nation with tens of millions of dollars annually. Japan uses the profits</p>
<p>Gained from This Trade</p>
<p>to purchase more military supplies. This is truly America's Disgrace. Today, we continue to partner with Japanese warlords in their business of death and destruction. Our traditional sense of fair dealing has been violated. The people of our country truly want peace and not war, etc. According to records, this pamphlet was issued by the "American Friends of the Chinese People Association" at 168 West 23rd Street, New York.</p>
<h3>Large Quantities of Domestic Goods Samples Shipped to Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Numbering Over Five or Six Hundred Pieces</p>
<p>Shipping Procedures are Currently Being Processed</p>
<p>Domestic goods groups in the city, such as the Shanghai General Federation of Chinese Industries, the United Federation of Chinese Domestic Manufacturers, and the United Federation of Machine-Made Domestic Goods Factories, received a notice from the Ministry of Economic Affairs to collect fine domestic goods samples from large and small domestic goods factories in the city to be shipped to various territories in Southeast Asia for display, in order to develop domestic goods sales. The above domestic goods groups jointly handled the collection matters in early May, under the auspices of the Shanghai General Federation of Chinese Industries. It is now known that the domestic goods samples have been collected and shipping procedures are currently being processed, and will be shipped within the next three or four days. It is reported that the number of samples collected will be over five or six hundred pieces, and are very exquisite. Once shipped to Southeast Asia, they will surely arouse the love of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia for domestic goods.</p>
<h3>American Destroyer Departs, Collides and Sinks a Fishing Boat</h3>
<p>Six American destroyers, numbered 211, 213, 217, 219, 224, and 236, which had been docked at pontoons 30, 30, 32, and 3 of Yangshupu, weighed anchor and departed one after another the day before yesterday. At about 1 PM that afternoon, after the destroyer 213 set sail and sailed downstream, it had just reached the Donggou section of the river when a privately-owned cargo sailboat fully loaded with fresh fish sailed upstream towards Shanghai. They collided head-on and could not avoid each other. The fishing boat was rammed amidships by the destroyer, and immediately split into two sections. The cargo and boat sank together, and all six crew members fell into the water at the same time. Fortunately, they were rescued one by one, but one of them had been injured, with his head bleeding. After the accident, the destroyer temporarily stopped sailing to ascertain the extent of the damage before continuing its departure. As for the damaged fishing boat, the front half could still be seen protruding from the water in the center of the river yesterday, while the back half was dragged to the Pudong beach and stranded.</p>
<h3>Securities Prices Continue to Fall, Trading Halted for Half a Day Yesterday; This Phenomenon is Entirely Due to Nervous Sentiment; The Government Must Have a Way to Maintain Credit</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has always been consistent in maintaining credit. Although customs duties in the occupied areas have been intercepted, there are already measures in place for domestic debt secured by customs duties, in order to avoid affecting the financial market. Repayment of principal on the National Rehabilitation Bonds and Gold Construction Bonds will continue as usual through lottery drawings. However, trading in the unofficial Shanghai securities market continued to decline yesterday. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Prices of Various Bonds Continue to Fall</p>
<p>The unofficial Shanghai securities market</p>
<p>has been unified since the day before yesterday. Due to the telegram announcing the suspension of principal and interest payments, prices plummeted. Yesterday morning, rumors continued to spread, and nervous sentiment led to continued declines in prices. At closing, Class A Unified Bonds closed at 56.8 yuan, down 3.25 yuan; Class B at 49.4 yuan, down 1.6 yuan; Class C at 48.5 yuan, down 1.75 yuan; Class D at 46.6 yuan, down 3.3 yuan; and Class E at 47.9 yuan, down 2.35 yuan. Trading was halted in the afternoon because today is the Dragon Boat Festival holiday, and there was insufficient time to settle the traded bonds. In addition, due to the large fluctuations in the bond market, a temporary announcement was made to halt trading for half a day.</p>
<p>In the Past, The Government Advanced Payments on Various Bonds</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking circles yesterday that the Ministry of Finance had issued a notice on January 15th, stipulating the methods for repaying various bonds secured by customs duties thereafter. According to the regulations, now that customs revenues in the occupied areas have been intercepted, and the customs revenues in the non-occupied areas are insufficient to repay foreign debts, domestic debt secured by surplus customs revenue should not be overdrawn and payments on their principal and interest should be suspended. However, in order to maintain credit, the Ministry of Finance still advances payments on the Unified, National Rehabilitation, and Gold Construction bonds that have matured in the past, and continues to repay principal and interest as usual, without suspending payments on the principal and interest of domestic debt due to the interception of customs revenues.</p>
<p>There are Already Measures in Place for the Principal and Interest of Unified Bonds</p>
<p>The principal and interest of the Unified Bonds maturing on July 31st of this year, totaling 56,600,350 yuan, will be affected if payments of principal and interest are suspended. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China and the National Debt Fund Management Committee have not received orders from the Ministry of Finance. Although the Shanghai branch of the Central Bank of China has telegraphed Chongqing for clarification, it has not received a reply. Therefore, as of last night, it was still impossible to confirm. However, if payments of principal and interest are suspended, it will have a significant impact on the financial market. It is said that there are measures in place to maintain credit, which will be announced by the Ministry of Finance at that time. In short, it will be maintained to the extent possible.</p>
<p>National Rehabilitation Bonds and Gold Construction Bonds Will be Drawn Regularly</p>
<p>The National Debt Fund Management Committee will continue to draw lots for bonds secured by customs duties as usual. The seventh drawing of the National Rehabilitation Bonds will be held on July 10th, drawing five numbers, with payments made by the Central Bank on August 31st. The twelfth drawing of the Financial Gold Construction Bonds will be held on September 10th, drawing twenty-five numbers, with payments made by the Bank of China, Bank of Communications and the Agricultural Bank on September 30th. It is said that banking circles are unable to comment on the credit maintenance measures for various bonds secured by customs duties formulated by the Ministry of Finance before they are announced. It is impossible to know whether "approval certificates for foreign exchange remittances" will be issued and whether banks will be allowed to "negotiate loans" at this time.</p>
<h3>Coal Prices Soar, Shipping Fares Increase</h3>
<p>Current Shipping Fares</p>
<p>Are Double Pre-War Rates</p>
<p>Amidst the tightening of foreign exchange and soaring coal prices, shipping fares and ticket prices are also increasing. In addition to the British companies Butterfield &amp; Swire and Jardine Matheson, which have officially announced that starting from the 22nd, shipping fares and ticket prices for their coastal liners traveling to the North and South Seas will be calculated according to new prices, which are approximately 20% higher than previous rates. The German company Far Eastern Navigation, along with Reiwa Yoko, Ludewig &amp; Co., and the Italian company Yi Hua Yang Xing, which operate the Shanghai-Wenzhou route, held a meeting at 2 PM on the 19th. As a result of the discussions, due to rising coal prices, in order to maintain costs, starting from the 22nd, ticket prices will be increased by 2 yuan for steerage, 3 yuan for cabin class, 4 yuan for official class, and 5 yuan for first class. Shipping fares will be determined after further discussions. It is also learned that ships operating on the Shanghai-Ningbo route will also increase shipping fares and ticket prices. The new rates are currently more than double pre-war rates.</p>
<h3>Lun Chang Factory Workers Eager for Resumption of Work</h3>
<p>The labor-management dispute at the British-owned Lun Chang Textile Factory in Pudong has remained unresolved for a month as of yesterday (the 20th). It is now heard that the striking workers are eager to resume work as soon as possible due to financial difficulties. Zhu Yuzhen, the puppet "Director of the Pudong District Office," also intends to lead "activists from the Workers' League" to the factory today to feign negotiations for a solution. Therefore, the stalemate situation has eased compared to before.</p>

<h3>Rice Industry Representatives Request Crackdown on Speculation and Manipulation; Visit He Dequi, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council; Suggest Effective Measures to Maintain Food Supply</h3>
<p>Rice Prices Rose Again Yesterday</p>
<p>Speculation in the Shanghai Bean and Rice Market has caused an unjustified surge in rice prices, affecting the livelihoods of citizens and social stability. The rice industry groups sent representatives to visit the concession authorities yesterday to suggest measures. The Market Management Committee will invite businesses tomorrow to advise them to maintain the food supply. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Visiting the Authorities, Suggesting Measures</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Trade Association, the Rice Dealers Association, and other groups sent four representatives, Chen Ziyi, Zhu Zixiang, Fu Qiangeng, and Zhang Nianxuan, to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement at 11 AM yesterday to visit Deputy Director He Dequi, report the reasons for the surge in rice prices, and request that the concession authorities take measures to crack down on speculation and manipulation, facilitate the source of domestic rice, and adopt effective measures to stabilize rice prices. Deputy Director He agreed to submit the rice industry's requests to the Grain Management Committee for research and handling.</p>
<p>Hoarders Continue to Buy Up Rice, Prices Rise Again</p>
<p>After the Bean and Rice Market opened yesterday, hoarders continued to buy up rice, causing prices to rise again. A total of more than 7,000 bags were traded. Changshu Zhenbai japonica rice even broke the 22-yuan mark, and Jiangyin Dingbai japonica rice was 21.8 yuan. Prices have reached record highs. Market transactions were extremely chaotic, and the Management Committee stated that it was unable to suppress prices. The market will be closed for two days starting today for Dragon Boat Festival settlement and will reopen for trading on the 23rd. Most of the rice traded previously was settled before the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<p>Market Meeting to Maintain the Food Supply</p>
<p>The Market Management Committee, recognizing that the surge in rice prices has a significant impact on citizens' livelihoods, has scheduled a meeting with various businesses for 3 PM tomorrow (the 22nd). In addition to discussing internal affairs, they will also advise businesses to find ways to stabilize rice prices and maintain the food supply. According to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency who interviewed a rice industry representative, the rice industry groups were unable to prevent the surge in rice prices due to limited power. Therefore, they suggested that the concession authorities adopt effective measures. They have decided to wait for the measures of the concession authorities.</p>
<p>There is No Fear of Food Shortages for Shanghai Citizens</p>
<p>Regarding rice stocks in Shanghai, there are still 523,822 bags, which is enough to maintain the food supply for two months. Moreover, although it is impossible to investigate, it is estimated that a significant number of citizens have pre-purchased rice. The rice blocked in Wuxi has reportedly been properly negotiated and has been released to Shanghai. Although Suzhou and Wuxi have banned exports, a small amount is still being transported. For example, on the 19th, 22 train cars and 2,500-2,600 bags were transported by ship. Land and water routes brought in more than 2,000 bags yesterday. Therefore, the supply has not actually been cut off.</p>
<p>Supervise the Market, Restrict Price Increases</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency, the rice industry groups previously had a rule that prices should not exceed a limit of 15 yuan in order to prevent rice market price increases, but it was cancelled because it could not be enforced. Currently, the rising prices are almost impossible to control. Major rice industry figures have agreed to adopt restrictive measures, stipulating that if rice prices rise due to a shortage of supply, each increase should not exceed 3 jiao. The next day's rice prices will be posted in the market, and the concession authorities will be asked to send personnel to supervise. Those who exceed the regulations will be severely punished. The implementation of this measure is to avoid unlimited price increases.</p>
<h3>British Warships Purchasing Food on the Yangtze River Threatened by Japanese Gunboats; Six Shells Fly Over the Bow of the British Warship; Could Lead to a Second Panay Incident</h3>
<p>According to the Continental News, the British gunboat HMS Gnat, while patrolling the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, often purchases products from farmers on both banks of the Yangtze River tributaries that lead to Haimen. On the 9th of this month, while conducting a routine patrol in the lower reaches of the river, it anchored opposite the south bank of the Yangtze River, relative to that tributary. When</p>
<p>A Large Sampan</p>
<p>carrying 3,000 eggs and 30 chickens, which had been pre-ordered by the HMS Gnat, approached the British warship to unload the food, a Japanese gunboat, which had been secretly moored nearby on the north bank of the river, sailed to the middle of the river and</p>
<p>Fired Six Shells</p>
<p>over the bow of the British warship, clearly targeting the sampan and attempting to prevent it from transporting food onto the British warship. At times, it seemed that a tragedy similar to the Panay incident was likely to occur. However, the sampan</p>
<p>Was Not Hit</p>
<p>and safely unloaded the eggs and chickens before sailing into the tributary and hiding. After the sampan disappeared, the Japanese gunboat fired two more shells at the mouth of the tributary, clearly warning the sampan not to approach the British warship again. On both banks of the tributary, there was</p>
<p>A Guerrilla Unit</p>
<p>that the crew of the British warship was unaware of. Moreover, a certain captain of the guerrilla unit was also on the sampan, unloading the eggs and chickens onto the British warship. It is believed that the Japanese did not know that he was also on the sampan.</p>
<h3>More Chinese Arrested in the Hongkou District</h3>
<p>Da Guangshe reports that the Japanese military in Hongkou has recently been conducting inspections in the district under the pretext of "searching for unstable elements." They have dispatched large numbers of military police and plainclothes personnel, subjecting Chinese people to various forms of harassment. Those who delay answering questions are often beaten and humiliated. They also intrude into residents' homes and shops, conducting arbitrary searches, causing great distress to residents. At about 8 AM yesterday, two Chinese men resembling laborers were arrested by Japanese soldiers while passing near the Zhapu Road bridge. At the same time, a Chinese man was also arrested on Xihuaide Road for unknown reasons.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Telegram Clarifies Exchange Rate Between Legal Tender and Foreign Currencies</h3>
<p>Any Disputes Must be Interpreted by</p>
<p>Judicial Organs</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Knitting Industry Association requesting clarification on the Ministry of Finance's telegram Yuqianhui No. 1548, issued last October, which stated, "In all contracts specifying payment in foreign currency converted from legal tender, the exchange rate published by the Central Bank on that day shall prevail." The association requested clarification as to whether this telegram applied to judgments made by judicial organs. The Chamber forwarded this telegram to the Ministry of Finance for clarification. The Ministry has now replied by telegram, which is being forwarded to the Knitting Industry Association. The telegram states, "We received the telegram from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce on the 17th of this month, Yuqianzi. Having reviewed your telegrams from the 5th, concerning silk production and the song and dance troupes, we find that the Ministry's instructions in the aforementioned telegram issued last October were proper instructions regarding the current financial system, and not legal provisions. Any disputes must be interpreted by judicial organs. These proper instructions should be followed consistently whenever questions arise regarding the exchange rate between legal tender and foreign currencies. Courts at all levels should apply these instructions uniformly. Apart from the submission to the Executive Yuan and the consultation with the Judicial Yuan regarding the dissemination of this information to all levels of the courts, this telegram serves to inform and notify you."</p>
<h3>Safety Campaign Proves Effective, Traffic Accidents Greatly Reduced; Concession Authorities Are Extremely Pleased, Hoping That Citizens Will Always Be Cautious</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the Road Safety Campaign Promotion Week. Boy Scouts responsible for the promotion went to various roads in the Northern District (north of Suzhou Creek) to carry out promotional activities. Lecturers gave speeches at public gathering places such as amusement grounds, docks, and parks. Although it drizzled in the afternoon, it did not interrupt the activities. Members of various comedy troupes also incorporated the key points of road safety into their performances and broadcasts, which was especially commendable. Safety films and statistical slideshows of traffic accident cases continued to be screened in various cinemas. Cases of traffic accidents, which were previously almost daily occurrences, have greatly decreased since the start of the Road Safety Campaign. Therefore, the two concession authorities have expressed extreme satisfaction with this and hope that citizens will always be cautious and adhere to safety rules.</p>

<h3>Fruits and Vegetables Shipped to Tianjin for Relief</h3>
<p>Guisheng and Hunan Two Ships Undertake Transportation</p>
<p>To Provide Relief to Overseas Chinese in the Tianjin Concession</p>
<p>The Yihe Yang Xing's ship Gui Sheng and the Taikoo Company's ship Hunan, based on the telegrams from the Shuntian and Risheng ships that sailed to Tianjin last week, reported that they had not been searched en route or upon arrival in Tianjin, and the situation seemed relatively calm. Therefore, the company authorities dispatched the ship Hunan to Tianjin at noon yesterday. As for Guihe and Gui Sheng, they were changed to leave at 4:30 AM this morning. In addition to flour, the two ships were loaded with large quantities of fresh fruits and vegetables. It is said that the vegetables were shipped to the blockaded Tianjin Concession to provide relief to the overseas Chinese within the concession.</p>
<h3>Refitting Rickshaw Wheels: Deadline Approaching</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council decided to extend the deadline for refitting rickshaw wheels to July 1st. As the deadline approaches, the Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association is actively guiding rickshaw pullers to complete the refitting on schedule to facilitate their business. Furthermore, the association is enthusiastically participating in the safety campaign. In addition to distributing various promotional materials, it has organized ten propaganda teams to conduct on-site guidance in different districts. The team members are continuing their work daily.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Seeks to Effectively Prevent Factory Accidents: Invites Factory Owners of Various Industries to Hold Meetings to Improve Equipment Separately to Ensure Safety</h3>
<p>Due to the surge in industrial accidents, the Factory Management Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council invited relevant industries to hold meetings to seek remedies. The following are the details reported by a reporter from Da Guang News Agency:</p>
<p>Accidents Increased Sharply Last Month</p>
<p>According to the section's report on industrial and occupational accidents reported in May, there were a total of 223 cases, including 7 fatalities. There were also 16 female workers injured, which is more than in April. The section sent personnel to investigate separately and provided guidance on prevention and improvement methods to enhance the safety of workers. Among them, 39 cases occurred in machinery and hardware industries, 37 in transportation industries, 36 in weaving industries, 18 in construction industries, 11 in printing industries, and the rest in other industries. The causes included 56 cases related to machinery power, 57 cases of falls, 29 cases of being injured by falling objects, and the rest involved electric shock, polishing belts, etc. As for fire incidents, there were a total of 31 cases, resulting in 10 injuries and 3 fatalities. The highest number of incidents occurred in machinery and hardware factories, with 8 cases, followed by 7 cases in weaving factories, 4 in chemical plants, and 3 each in celluloid and woodworking factories. The remaining cases occurred in printing and dry-cleaning factories. In addition, some straw hat businesses have been spraying celluloid on paper hat blanks in crowded residential buildings, which is extremely dangerous. In recent months, several factories have experienced fires due to spraying paint, resulting in the deaths of 18 workers. At the same time, accidents and fires have also occurred frequently in factories using voltage machines and manufacturing flashlight bulbs.</p>
<p>Inviting Various Industries to Seek Improvement</p>
<p>In order to prevent accidents and ensure the safety of workers, the Factory Management Section of the Shanghai Municipal Council has successively invited various industries to hold discussions: (1) A meeting was held with straw hat manufacturers, requesting that no paint spraying work be carried out in factories other than those with approved premises. Two larger factories were asked to build proper paint spraying rooms for the industry to use, in order to protect people's lives. (2) As a result of the meeting of factories where accidents occurred due to the use of voltage machines, each factory agreed to adopt accident prevention methods and complete them in the near future. (3) At the meeting of electric bulb factory owners, the section asked each factory to propose general methods that they could afford and easily comply with, and to collectively guarantee that they could be effectively implemented. Each factory has now reported to the section one after another.</p>
<h3>The Chinese YMCA's Military Service</h3>
<p>Over the Past Year</p>
<p>Remarkable Achievements</p>
<p>Since its inception, the Chinese YMCA movement has undergone more than fifty years, with the aim of promoting the spirit of Christ, uniting young people with common aspirations, cultivating complete personalities, and building a perfect society. It has long been praised by the people of the country. Since the outbreak of war, it has been deeply concerned about the unprecedented crisis facing the nation and grieved by the tragic sacrifices of the people. Therefore, it has striven to promote the work of the extraordinary period in accordance with its service aspirations. It has made great efforts to carry out military service work, which is considered to be of paramount importance. During the Battle of the Great Wall in 1933 and the Suiyuan War in 1936, it carried out military service work in accordance with this principle, in conjunction with the national YMCA. Since the Lugouqiao Incident revealed the full-scale war, it has been conducting large-scale military service for more than twenty months. The methods of work are divided into (1) consolation and reception, (2) wound dressing and rescue, (3) training and education, and (4) recreation and entertainment. The first type (consolation and reception) includes setting up reception stations at train stations to provide tea, water, porridge, and collecting various kinds of consolation gifts to distribute to the army and wounded soldier hospitals. The second type (wound dressing and rescue) includes setting up temporary dressing stations and sending personnel to be stationed on health trains and health ships to bandage and change medicines for wounded soldiers, and to care for and support seriously wounded soldiers. The third type (training and education) includes organizing military clubs, officer clubs, setting up alarms, holding current affairs lectures, and providing spiritual lectures and physical training for recruits. The fourth type (recreation and entertainment) includes organizing touring service groups, showing movies and educational slides, performing Peking opera and dramas, holding military-civilian parties or wounded soldier parties, and equipping various clubs with various forms of recreation and entertainment for officers and soldiers to freely use during rest. Military service work began in the fall of 1937 and has been going on for more than twenty months. The organizational method is to establish a headquarters in the central location in front, responsible for planning, dispatching, and supervising. Branches are established in various places to carry out the work. In the past, due to the drastic changes in the war situation, branches were moved and dispersed from time to time. At most, there were 20 branches, and the number of staff reached more than 160 people (excluding employees). These staff members do not receive salaries (only personal living expenses are paid), do not hesitate to work hard, and their lives are often in danger under artillery fire and air raids. Their enthusiasm for service has never diminished, which is truly admirable. In terms of the amount of work done, for example, in the reception work, the Zhengzhou branch burned more than 2,000 catties of firewood every day during a certain period. In addition to tea, water, and porridge, 20 pots of porridge were cooked. In the rescue work, the Xinyang branch used more than 2,000 rolls of bandages to change medicines for wounded soldiers in 16 hours on a certain day. In the past, this kind of work was praised by people from all walks of life, who made material donations, so it was possible to achieve such widespread service with a small amount of more than 100,000 yuan. This year, encouraged by the highest authorities, it was decided to expand the scale again, planning to increase the number of service branches from 20 to 40, and increase the number of staff by 250 people. Once the funds are raised, it can be safely implemented according to the plan. Other examples include student relief work, which includes (1) establishing work-study quotas for students affected by the war, and (2) subsidizing students stranded in other places to return to their hometowns or transfer to schools in the interior. This relief work has now been implemented in 13 locations, and the amount of aid disbursed, as of the end of last year, totaled 100,000 yuan in national currency. As for refugee relief work, in Shanghai, Hankou, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Peiping, Tianjin, Nanchang, Hangzhou, Changsha, and other cities, great efforts are being made to help refugees, either by assuming responsibility for managing shelters, operating refugee industrial workshops, or presiding over refugee production and education, or even being entrusted by local governments to be responsible for the reception and repatriation of refugees throughout the province. The results of their work are also very remarkable. As for the youth service movement, international friendship work, the development of municipal associations in the rear, youth associations were established in Guiyang and Guilin last year, and the promotion of student affairs, such as the successful holding of student summer camps in six locations when the war was fierce last summer. There are also three newly established university associations. All the plans are commendable.</p>
<h3>White Russian Organizations Sequentially and Voluntarily Liquidate: Refuse to Register with the White Russian Emigrant Committee, Believing That the Committee's Policies and Motives are Ambiguous</h3>
<p>Refuse to Register with the White Russian Emigrant Committee: Believing that the Committee's Policies and Motives are Ambiguous</p>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Government" is using the White Russian Emigrant Committee to force all White Russian organizations to register. The White Russians in this city are increasingly dissatisfied. Recently, the White Russian Business Association has announced its voluntary liquidation. Any White Russian organization that refuses to register with the White Russian Emigrant Committee and report the personal details of its members has no other option but to liquidate. It is impossible to ignore the registration order and continue as usual, as its members will be discriminated against and suffer losses. Although the White Russian Emigrant Committee claims that this move is non-political, the White Russian leaders who oppose registration do not value this statement, and say that they cannot register with an organization whose policies and motives are ambiguous.</p>

<h3>Brothel Pimp Coerces Prostitute to Cohabit: Uses Threatening Words and Robs Her Bracelet; Prostitute Gong Caidi Reports Arrest</h3>
<p>Sun Achang from Shaoxing, aged fifty-two, has a history of committing theft, intimidation, fraud, and acid attacks, and has been repeatedly sentenced. He has only recently become somewhat settled, working as a pimp in various brothels. He is currently working as an assistant in a brothel at No. 8 Qunyu Lane, Shantou Road. As a result, he became acquainted with Gong Caidi (25 years old, from Zhenjiang), the owner of the Yunniang Brothel at No. 22 Huile Lane, Fuzhou Road. Now, Gong is planning to close the Yunniang Brothel after the Dragon Boat Festival because of</p>
<p>Slow Business.</p>
<p>On the night of the 1st of the month, around midnight, she suddenly received a call from a regular customer surnamed Yang, instructing her to quickly go to Room 504 of the China-South Hotel on Edward Road. Gong dressed up and went there. However, after entering the room, there was no customer surnamed Yang in the room, only Sun Achang. When Sun saw Gong arrive, he immediately threatened her with dangerous words: "I know that you are going to retire from the brothel after the Dragon Boat Festival, so I called you. You should</p>
<p>Cohabit with Me</p>
<p>Otherwise, you will suffer." Gong thought that Sun's words were unreasonable. Their identities were different, and there was no past relationship. It was strange that he suddenly made such an unreasonable demand, so she sternly refused. Unexpectedly, Sun snatched a gold bracelet worth more than two hundred yuan from Gong's hand, saying that if she did not agree to his request, she should not think about getting the bracelet back. Only then did he let her go. Gong returned, and knowing that these pimps all had potential power, she dared not report to the police. However, at half past midnight the night before last, Sun suddenly</p>
<p>Arrived with a Threatening Presence</p>
<p>At Gong's place, seemingly wanting to do something. Gong was frightened and called the Old Gate Police Station. Inspector Zhang Bingchun was immediately ordered to rush to the scene and arrest Sun, confiscating a fake gold bracelet. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi charged him with robbery, and said that because the case was urgent and there was not enough time for a detailed investigation, and because the defendant may have interfered with freedom, further research was needed, so he requested permission to extend the trial. Under Questioning,</p>
<h3>Due to Suspicion of Extortion: Detectives and Police Arrest and Detain; Temporarily Detained for Investigation and Re-examination</h3>
<p>The West Patrol Chief of the French Concession Police learned that two of his subordinates, Chinese Detective Lu Zhenchang (25 years old, from Zhenjiang, residing at No. 100 Du Shenfu Road) and Chinese Constable Ye Jiahong (25 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 51 Ruan An Lane, West Gate Road), had engaged in extortion from Zhang Qinghua, who ran an opium den at No. 67 Xin Yong'an Street, at 1:00 p.m. on the 18th of this month. Therefore, Lu Detective and Ye Constable were detained and taken into custody. Yesterday afternoon, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the French Concession Administrative Authority, stated that because the defendants were suspected of extortion, he requested detention and a later date for investigation and trial. Under Questioning, Lu Zhenchang confessed that he used to be a doorman at the French General Association. He had only been a Chinese detective in the police station for 42 days. On that day, he was passing by Xin Yong'an Street when he heard a police siren. He rushed to see what was happening and saw someone beating a constable. I asked them what was going on, but they did not answer and beat me too. They then went to the police station. I reported the case afterwards and did not know about the extortion. Constable Ye confessed that he went to No. 67 Xin Yong'an Street to find a friend, Wang Asan, because Wang had asked me to recommend a stevedore. I went to find Wang, but unexpectedly they said that I stole something. I said that they were breaking the law by smoking opium and called me a thief, so there was an argument but no extortion. After verification by Judge Liao, it was ordered that the defendants be detained for further investigation and re-examination at a later date.</p>
<p>Sun Achang confessed that he had a relationship with the prostitute Gong in April last year. Now, because she wanted to cohabit with him, he refused because Gong was addicted to opium and he could not afford it, and because her father and brothers were unusually fierce. Although he pawned the gold bracelet at Baocheng Silver Shop on French Avenue for 163 yuan, Gong took 73 yuan of it, and the rest was used to pay off her opium debts. However, Gong completely denied Sun's confession, calling it a fabrication and deliberate slander. After verification by Judge Xiao Xie Fen, Sun was ordered to be detained and re-examined at a later date.</p>
<h3>Woman Finds Hand Grenade: Entrusts Someone to Sell It; Intercepted by Detectives on the Way</h3>
<p>Zhang Wangshi, a woman from Jiangbei, previously found two hand grenades in the Zhabei area and hid them on a boat. Recently, Zhang Wangshi wanted to sell the hand grenades for 25 yuan each and entrusted Dai Weicai and Dai Keyang to sell them. At 2:00 p.m. yesterday, she and the two Dais went ashore with the grenades. Unexpectedly, while walking on Meibage Road, they realized that someone seemed to be following them, so they secretly hid the two grenades in a trash can at Lane 345. Then, they went to a teahouse nearby to drink tea and avoid the followers. Half an hour later, when they went to Lane 345 to retrieve the hand grenades, they found that there was only one left, so they took it out and walked along Parker Road and Qingdao Road. They were apprehended by Detective Ma Zhongrong, Chen Lianjing, and Detective Huang Yulin of the Xinza Police Station and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Criminal Court of the Special First District Court. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts of the case and requested a postponement. Judge Xiao ordered them to be detained for re-examination in seven days.</p>
<h3>Robbers Arrested: Both Sides Exchange Multiple Shots; Robbers Eventually Escape</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 p.m. last night, several robbers broke into a double-fronted shop at No. 438 West Rubicon Road. One robber, holding a Mauser pistol, wantonly threatened the shop employees and apprentices. One shop assistant had a gold ring and seven yuan in legal tender stolen from his hand. Someone went outside to blow the police whistle. At this time, the Putuo Road Police Station heard the alarm and sent a police car to the scene. The robbers fired their guns to resist arrest. Chinese and foreign detectives also drew their guns and fired back. As a result, no one was injured on either side. The robbers eventually escaped into the darkness without a trace.</p>
<h3>Woman Commits Suicide by Swallowing Opium</h3>
<p>Xu Huangshi, a woman from Ningbo, 40 years old, resided at No. 13 Yide Lane, Old North Gate. Her husband had accumulated some wealth before the August 13th Incident and opened Yuxianglong Hardware Store. After the Shanghai War, it closed down due to financial difficulties. Xu Huangshi was addicted to gambling. Her husband often scolded her because of the difficult financial situation. Last night, Xu Huangshi suddenly had a thought of ending her life and committed suicide by swallowing opium ashes. At around 7:00 p.m., her husband discovered her and took her to the hospital for treatment. Her life is in danger.</p>
<h3>High-Explosive Shell Explodes: Two Workers Injured</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, a high-explosive shell suddenly exploded near Lan Road in Yangshupu, injuring two people. It is reported that two workers collecting scrap metal were working at the time. They mistook the shell for a piece of copper and accidentally dropped it on the ground, causing it to explode.</p>
<h3>Strikes Head Viciously with Axe</h3>
<p>Zhang Jinshui Near Death from Suicide</p>
<p>At around 1:00 a.m. yesterday, a young man named Zhang Jinshui (24 years old), residing at No. 75 Aierjin Road, for some unknown reason, suddenly used an ax to strike his head in his bedroom to commit suicide. At the time, blood flowed like a river, and he fell to the ground in pain, groaning incessantly. His roommate discovered him and immediately rushed him to Renji Hospital for medical treatment. His life is said to be in extreme danger.</p>
<h3>Due to Unsuccessful Remuneration for Transporting Old Iron Chains: Pours Nitric Acid on Friend; Cao Xue Dian is Greedy and Insatiable; Yang Hong Ai Committed Theft</h3>
<p>Yang Hongqing, a man from Jiangbei, lived with his wife, Liu, at No. 82, Lane 460, Da Tong Road. Cao Xueli, a friend of Yang's, had known Yang for many years. Because Cao repeatedly asked Yang for loans, Yang often provided assistance. On the 15th of this month, Cao suddenly went to Yang's place, saying that he had no place to live and asked to stay for a few days. Yang agreed. On the afternoon of the 17th, Cao wanted to borrow money again. Yang, considering him</p>
<p>Greedy and Insatiable,</p>
<p>Rejected him. Unexpectedly, Cao became angry out of embarrassment and had an argument with Yang, leading to a conflict. Cao left in a huff. Two hours later, he returned. Around 2:40 a.m. on the 18th, while Yang and his wife were sound asleep, Cao, harboring evil intentions, secretly took a bottle of prepared nitric acid and poured it on Yang and his wife's heads, faces, chests, and arms. Yang and others woke up in pain from their dreams and</p>
<p>Loudly Called for Help.</p>
<p>Cao abandoned the bottle and fled without a trace. Yang and his wife were taken to Baolong Hospital for treatment, and the Xinzha Police Station was informed, who sent Detective Dong Quan to investigate. Since Cao Xueli had no address and had fled, he was strictly searched for. At 10:43 a.m. on the 19th, Cao suddenly surrendered himself to the General Patrol Station and was transferred to the Xinzha Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the facts of the case and charged him with injury under Article 278 of the Criminal Law. Yang Hongqing and Yang Liu Min were</p>
<p>Helped into Court</p>
<p>To describe the situation at the time. Under Questioning, the defendant Cao Xueli confessed that after the January 28th Incident, Yang Hongqing held a weapon and robbed a rice store and was arrested and sentenced to seven years in prison. He was sent to prison for execution. After serving three and a half years, he was released on bail. Since the August 13th Incident, Yang had been transporting old iron in Hongkou with my help, but he did not provide the remuneration as promised, so I accumulated hatred and took this action out of anger. Judge Xiao verified the confessions and ordered the defendant to be detained for re-examination and sentencing in seven days.</p>
<h3>Woman Holding Her Son: Accuses Restaurant Owner of Abandonment; Defendant Firmly Denies; Arguments Concluded, Awaiting Judgment</h3>
<p>He Ruitang from Ningbo, 41 years old this year, residing at No. 1548 Avenue Joffre and running the Futai Foreign Vegetable, Fruit, and Beef Shop at No. 1749 on the same road, was previously accused by He Lin Alai, the widow of his deceased cousin He Shangwu, residing at No. 68 Tao'erfeisishi Hill, of seduction, cohabitation, abandonment, and neglect in the Criminal Court of the Special Second District Court. As a result of the trial, because the plaintiff did not present substantial evidence, only making</p>
<p>Empty Claims,</p>
<p>He Ruitang was found not guilty. Later, the plaintiff did not file an appeal. Now, Lin Alai claims that He Ruitang seduced her into cohabitation and has conceived and given birth to a son named Xiao Tang, who is one year old this year. Because He Ruitang has always abandoned and neglected them, Lin Alai, as a legal representative, along with her son He Xiao Tang, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Special Second District Court against He Ruitang to confirm the parent-child relationship. The court, based on the lawsuit, opened the Seventh Civil Court yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Li Liang, and</p>
<p>Summoned Both Parties</p>
<p>For trial. The plaintiff, Lin Alai, holding her son, claimed in court that her husband, He Shangwu, was the defendant's cousin and had been dead for five years. Initially, the defendant seduced her when she was lonely and began cohabitation in October 1937, cohabiting in the same place with his wife. Later, because his wife was fierce, the defendant had her move out to another place. However, the defendant often took her to the Ruizhong Hotel at No. 275 Zhejiang Road and the Lianyuan Hotel next to the Grand Theatre for illicit relations, resulting in pregnancy and the birth of Xiao Tang.</p>
<p>When Opening the Hotel,</p>
<p>The defendant used the pseudonym He Asan. This can be investigated. The defendant's lawyer, Li Pengcheng, arrived on his behalf. He denied having any relationship with the plaintiff. He stated that the plaintiff had always worked as a maid outside. After her husband died, she asked the defendant to employ her at home as a maid. Later, because the plaintiff often brought men to the defendant's house, he dismissed her. After verifying the facts in court, the case was deemed clear, the debate was concluded, and the judgment was scheduled for the 24th.</p>
<h3>Police Authorities Strictly Prohibit Extortion of Illegal Fees</h3>
<p>With the approach of the Dragon Boat Festival, the French Concession Police Authorities have discovered that some unemployed hooligans are gathering in crowds to extort illegal fees from various shops for their own use, which is abhorrent. Yesterday, all police stations were notified to send competent detectives to various shops and vegetable markets to inform the shop owners and vegetable vendors not to pay a single cent. If hooligans use force to extort, they are authorized to call the police and arrest them. Patrol constables were also instructed to pay attention to the actions of those who resemble hooligans. If they encounter such individuals extorting illegal fees from shops and vegetable vendors, they should be arrested for investigation to ensure business stability.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Closed</h3>
<p>The Da Guang News Agency reports that the "You Cheng Company" on Avenue Joffre and Rue du Consulat in West Shanghai was a large-scale gambling den that used a guessing game similar to "White Pigeon Tickets" called "Character Gall." In fact, it was nothing more than a disguised lottery organization. The "Company" had just opened last month and had falsely used the name "You Cheng Pharmaceutical Company" to publish a large advertisement in the newspaper, falsely claiming to recruit salespersons to lure people into the game. However, after this trick was exposed, few responded, resulting in sluggish "business" and a sparse crowd. However, due to the large number of internal employees and huge expenses, the company suffered losses of up to 250,000 yuan within a month and could not maintain operations, so it closed down a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Streetcar Collides Violently with Rickshaw: Rickshaw Puller Dies Tragically</h3>
<p>Ma Shiyu, a man from Anhui, 29 years old, residing at No. 16 Yaoshui Lane, Xiaoshadu Road, made a living pulling rickshaws. At 8:30 a.m. yesterday, Ma and his companion were pulling a rickshaw to the intersection of Xinzha Road and Datong Road when they suddenly collided with a tram on Route 3. Due to the force of the tram, the rickshaw wheel was damaged. The wooden axle in the wheel was broken and flew out. One of the wooden axles struck Ma in the abdomen, penetrating deeply into the abdomen and damaging his internal organs. After the incident, Patrolman No. 3387 arrived and took the injured man to Baolong Hospital for treatment. After the doctor removed the wooden stake, Ma died after a short time.</p>
<h3>Good News for Refugees</h3>
<p>The First Orphanage at No. 330 North Fujian Road is the private house of Mr. Wei Guan, a great philanthropist in this city, and has been used for a long time. The lease was originally scheduled to expire at the end of April. Now, Mr. Wei Guan, seeing the suffering of the refugees who have been displaced, has generously agreed to extend the lease. More than 500 refugees have been spared from wandering the streets. This is a gift from Mr. Wei Guan. All the refugees in the orphanage are extremely grateful and have specially presented a plaque to thank his benevolence.</p>
<h3>Bank Accountant Arrested for Embezzling Large Sums of Money; Converting Exchange Rate Profits into Private Funds; Discovered by Authorities and Detained for Interrogation</h3>
<p>Fang Xile, a Cantonese man residing at No. 20 Fude Lane, Hart Road, who enjoyed gambling, was employed as an accountant at the Dong Bank, No. 52 Ningbo Road. However, Fang had a gambling addiction, frequently visiting the Jai Alai and dog racing tracks, leading to mounting debts. Recently, the bank discovered that Fang had been embezzling funds totaling 31,498.73 yuan through fraudulent practices. The embezzlement method involved clients of the Guangdong Bank who had remittances to foreign countries but did not settle accounts at the time. Later, after a considerable period, settlements were made. Due to the recent rise in gold prices, the settlement price often exceeded the remittance price significantly. This settlement profit should have been enjoyed by the Guangdong Bank, but Fang embezzled it all. The bank reported this to the General Inspectorate, and Chief Detective Jiang Shangpei of the Chinese Detective Bureau arrested Fang at his residence yesterday. Fang was brought to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court yesterday. The Detective Bureau's lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, prosecuted him for embezzlement under Article 336 of the Criminal Law, stating that the Detective Bureau had not been notified of the method of calculating the embezzled amount. Therefore, a request was made to postpone the trial for one week. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, Fang was ordered to be remanded in custody, and the trial was postponed.</p>

<h3>Weather Report</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory's weather forecast for 4:30 PM yesterday stated that the wind direction around Shandong is uncertain, and the weather is changeable. There is a cyclone in this area and the northern part of the East China Sea, with fog or rain, due to a small low-pressure system passing northeast-east. South of Ma'an Island, the weather is hot and humid, gradually clearing up. Cloudy with rain or fog, with strong southeast to southwest winds. Also, within the 24 hours prior to 3:00 PM yesterday, the temperature in this city was a maximum of 87.4 degrees and a minimum of 71.6 degrees. On the same day last year, the maximum was 74.3 degrees, and the minimum was 67.1 degrees.</p>

<p>Science and Life</p>
<h3>Neither Up Nor Down</h3>
<p>— He Shi</p>
<p>The importance of elevating and promoting science has been discussed before. Now, I will discuss the weaknesses of the current state of science in the country, as a source of mutual encouragement for colleagues. Our country has been paying attention to science for decades. The government and society have often promoted it, but those engaged in science in the country, due to their lack of effort, have caused science to become neither up nor down. (It should be stated here that there are indeed experts in the country who are working hard, and their spirit and achievements are admirable, which cannot be completely dismissed. However, they are few in number and still cannot defeat the majority who are hesitant to move forward). Although the number of specialized personnel is increasing, they use their knowledge to seek special treatment, and their desire to serve the country cannot overcome their selfish thoughts of self-preservation. They believe that the knowledge and training they have received are sufficient to make them proud of the country and more than enough for themselves, and they no longer conduct in-depth research. Moreover, they have no interest in the work of promoting science education and imparting scientific knowledge to the lower levels of society, such as giving public lectures and publishing simple articles that can increase the level of knowledge of the Chinese people and improve their living habits. As a result, common scientific knowledge cannot be popularized among the people, and science in our country is inevitably becoming aristocratic. Even today, it still cannot be transformed from an imported product into a native one, which is regrettable. For this reason, science in our country has failed to flourish and compete with the world's advanced scientific countries. The country's urgent and serious problems, which require scientific and technological solutions, are helpless and have to rely on others. Because the people lack common scientific knowledge, their knowledge and skills are also particularly backward. Suddenly encountering this serious national crisis, they are slaughtered, burned, and looted by others, and suffer all kinds of torments. Alas, whose fault is it! Our country's scientific community is not lacking in patriotic and ambitious people. I hope that everyone will be determined to encourage themselves and work hard to improve and promote scientific work.</p>
<h3>Summer's Greatest Enemy: The Disgusting Bedbug</h3>
<p>— Xing Qiu</p>
<p>Introducing several methods to eliminate them</p>
<p>Anyone living in the city knows that the greatest enemy in summer is the bedbug. It sucks human blood, causing the skin to swell, itch, and become painful. Of course, some people are not affected by it. Bedbugs usually lie dormant during the day and come out at night, making it difficult to sleep and even affecting work during the day. The crevices of wooden walls, bedding, and all daily-use furniture are where they live. This parasite, of course, comes from uncleanliness, but we often find traces of this nasty thing on people who wear fine clothes. Bedbugs are small animals that are truly easy to breed and spread widely.</p>
<p>Bedbugs belong to the order Hemiptera and the family Cimicidae. They have many names. The Japanese call them Nanjing bugs, and the English call them bed bugs or wall lice. There are two common types: one is the tropical bedbug (Cimex hemiptera Fabr), which is distributed in the tropics and subtropics, and is very common in the southern provinces of our country; the other is the temperate bedbug (Cimex lectularius L.), which is most common in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins. Adult bedbugs are flat on their backs and bellies, making them suitable for crawling in crevices. They are four to five millimeters long and three millimeters wide, with a brownish-brown color. The whole body is divided into three parts: head, thorax, and abdomen. Reproduction is incomplete metamorphosis. The development from egg to nymph to adult is short. If the temperature and food are suitable, it only takes thirty days from egg to adult. Therefore, the climate is warm, and they can almost reproduce all year round, at least five or six generations, but they are relatively inactive in winter. The spread of bedbugs, of course, migrates to other places with the host. If there is no one in the room, they will also eat the blood of other animals. Even if they lack food, it does not have a significant impact. They can often maintain life for more than a year without eating. This fact has been proven by people in China and abroad. According to the report of the American Giranlt in 1905, female insects lay 75 to 200 eggs at a time. If male and female bedbugs are imprisoned in a bottle without food and allowed to mate, their lives can last from 54 to 316 days. This shows that once a family is infested with bedbugs, it is really difficult to get rid of them, and at the same time, where they live is really elusive.</p>
<p>The long-term survival of bedbugs is completely related to temperature, because temperature can limit their activity and make them hibernate or semi-hibernate. They have great resistance to low temperatures. They live quite vigorously above 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and gradually become dormant below 60 degrees Fahrenheit. However, when the temperature reaches 96 degrees Fahrenheit and the temperature is increased at the same time, they die completely. The source of their odor comes from the stink gland in the body, located inside the mesothorax and opening at the base of the hind legs. The secreted odorous liquid is very clear, oily, volatile, and strongly acidic. It is a natural defense method, but it is actually detrimental to it, and people can know and catch it.</p>
<p>I have talked a lot about the ecology and habits of bedbugs. We know that they are easy to breed and difficult to get rid of. The effective method, of course, is to prevent them in advance, pay attention to cleanliness, and do not bring adult bedbugs or eggs into the room from other places. Now that you have them, the following methods of eradication can be used as a reference.</p>
<p>1. Fumigation: The chemicals used are sodium cyanide (one pound), sulfuric acid (one and a half pounds), and water (three pounds) (assuming the house is 1,000 cubic feet). The procedure is to first close the doors and windows tightly, put the water in a ceramic basin, and slowly pour in sulfuric acid, stirring with a stick. Then gently put in sodium cyanide (wrapped in paper). Workers should quickly go out and then close the doors and windows tightly, letting it fumigate. After 12 hours, the bedbugs can be killed. This method is the most effective, but attention must be paid to the implementation of this toxic gas. First, all the gaps in the room must be plugged to prevent the toxic gas from entering other rooms.</p>
<p>Another method is to put calcium cyanide on the floor of the room, choosing a day with a higher temperature to do it. Use four ounces of medicine for every 100 cubic feet of sealed room, and seal the room for 20 hours. Sulfur can also be used, four pounds per thousand cubic feet. When fumigating, put the sulfur in an iron pan, add a little alcohol, and then put it in a large basin of water to prevent fire. The fumigation time is 18 hours to one day and night.</p>
<p>2. Filling: Fill the gaps in the room with various materials to prevent the bedbugs' living places from having constant air circulation. Tung oil and lime soft blocks can be used on wooden boards, and lime can be used to paint brick walls.</p>
<p>3. Pouring: Bedbugs often live in the gaps in bed frames, so this method is very economical, but it cannot completely eradicate them. There are several common medicines: A. Put kerosene and pyrethrum powder in a bottle, one catty of oil and three or four taels of powder, and soak it tightly for four or five days. Then use it to spray the gaps, which is very effective. B. Pouring kerosene or turpentine into the gaps in the shop table can also kill some of them. C. Killing with boiling water is also slightly effective. D. Mix mercury chloride (one ounce), alcohol (one pint), and turpentine (one pint), and use crow feathers to drip it into the bed gaps, which is very effective.</p>
<p>4. Cleanliness and Heat: Pay attention to cleanliness and be diligent in catching them to reduce their reproduction. When the temperature is extremely high in summer, burn charcoal in the room, close the doors and windows tightly to make the temperature very high, which can often suffocate the bedbugs. Some people have even tried mixing rhubarb, rock sugar, and lye with boiling water, pouring it into the gaps of utensils repeatedly, and the bedbugs will disappear.</p>
<p>The methods to eradicate bedbugs are probably no more than the above. The first fumigation method is of course the most suitable for public places such as schools and hotels. It may not be easy for ordinary families to implement it in this way, so they can only choose a convenient method to implement it. In short, "cleanliness" and "diligent catching" are the only wonderful methods, and you must not let them reproduce naturally without killing them. Although it is not certain that biting by bedbugs will cause great danger, it is said that a skin disease called oriental sore and black fever (Kala-azar) are transmitted by these disgusting bedbugs.</p>
<p>Now is the period of great activity of bedbugs. I wonder how many citizens suffer from them at night, directly suffering physically and indirectly affecting their mental work. We should all rise up and carry out a bedbug eradication campaign together.</p>
<h3>Animals and Space</h3>
<p>— Ji Qian</p>
<p>Animals have a great reproductive capacity. Scholars have determined that there are more than 90,000 known species of animals in the world. It is impossible to calculate how many individuals there are in each species. It is even more unknown how many species have not been determined. Take just one class of insects, their number is so great that experts say it can be compared to the number of stars in the sky. Animals live in all places on earth where they can grow. Plains and broad swamps are easier to breed; animals can be found on high mountains of 10,000 feet, with snow and ice; there are also animals in the seabed six miles deep; there are animals in the Arctic and Antarctic oceans; there are also animals in very hot springs, in salt lakes, and in very dry deserts. The reason for this is that they reproduce very quickly. The slowest animal to reproduce is the elephant. The life span of an elephant is 100 years. Its breeding starts at 30 years old and ends at 90 years old. On average, it only gives birth to one offspring every ten years, and only six elephants in its lifetime. Other birds, such as the golden eagle, also reproduce slowly, but not as slow as elephants. There are other animals that reproduce slowly, but compared to elephants and golden eagles, they are still faster. This is a minority phenomenon. As a general rule, the speed of animal reproduction is increasing rapidly. Looking at flies, each female fly can lay more than 120 eggs at a time, and each fly lays eggs 12-13 times. The total number is known. Ordinary fish can lay thousands of eggs, and frogs also lay a large number of eggs. At the turn of spring and summer, there are clusters of frog eggs in ponds, each cluster containing hundreds of eggs. Frogs lay eggs many times during the spawning season. The number produced in one period is unknown, but it is likely to be tens of thousands. A certain species of starfish can produce at least 20 million eggs in each breeding season. The smallest trichomonads can multiply to millions in one week. A pair of midges can produce 60 million million offspring in one summer. In short, the speed of animal reproduction is beyond our dreams. As mentioned earlier, elephants reproduce extremely slowly. Darwin once said that if all the offspring of a pair of elephants could survive and develop, they could have 19 million descendants after more than 700 years. If they were passed on for thousands of years, they could fill all the gaps on the earth! The American Mr. Wu Teluff observed the asexual reproduction of paramecia. Starting with more than 3,000 paramecia, they increased threefold after 48 hours. He said that if they could all survive, the volume of the offspring produced by reproduction after five years could be 10,000 times that of the earth. The Englishman Malthus said that the increase of organisms follows a geometric progression, and the food on earth is not enough to supply them. In addition, the gaps on the ground are limited, and the environment is constantly changing. Darwin and Wallace said that this is the phenomenon of competition for survival, is it not true!</p>
<h3>Hair Growth and Seasons</h3>
<p>— Gu Buwen</p>
<p>Hair Grows More Easily in Hot Weather</p>
<p>Hair growth varies from season to season. The length of growth is related to temperature. According to scholars' observations, there is now a practical measurement method. The subject of the experiment was a 59-year-old male. Throughout the year, the same location on the face was designated, and hair was shaved daily at the same time. This designated location was an area of one square inch near the front of the ear, and a Ocular Micrometer was used for measurement. The average daily temperature (based on the astronomical observatory's report) was also recorded, and the records were continuously kept without omission. The results of the experiment were as follows:</p>
<p>Month Average Temperature Hair Growth Length</p>
<p>January 58 degrees ·305 hao</p>
<p>February 54 degrees ·386 hao</p>
<p>March 61 degrees ·404 hao</p>
<p>April 70 degrees ·458 hao</p>
<p>May 74 degrees ·464 hao</p>
<p>June 81 degrees ·516 hao</p>
<p>July 83 degrees ·533 hao</p>
<p>August 82 degrees ·538 hao</p>
<p>September 79 degrees ·545 hao</p>
<p>October 73 degrees ·533 hao</p>
<p>November 64 degrees ·495 hao</p>
<p>December 60 degrees ·375 hao</p>

<h3>After Reading "The Patriot"</h3>
<p>— Lin Ying</p>
<p>I don't particularly like writing book reviews, but after I finished reading "The Patriot," a compilation of translations by Shanghai translators, I couldn't help but express my feelings. Indeed, it moved me to the point of anger.</p>
<p>Pearl S. Buck's "The Good Earth" caused a sensation in the American publishing world five or six years ago, and the author made a fortune. It sparked a heated discussion in Chinese literary circles, and the final conclusion was that it sufficiently depicted the life of Chinese farmers, but lacked understanding of the Chinese countryside. Of course, that's in the past. Now, this "The Patriot" portrays Chinese intellectuals, and her understanding is not just lacking, it's simply "nonsense"! Her descriptions and structure are even more scattered and disorganized!</p>
<p>Now, let me first narrate the main points of the story.</p>
<p>I-fan, a student at a missionary school and the son of a banker, joins the 1927 revolution "inexplicably" after meeting his classmate En-lai. Because of Chiang Kai-shek's purge in Shanghai, he is sent by his father to work at Mr. Muraki's trading company in Japan, where he falls in love with and pursues Muraki's daughter, eventually marrying her. A little over a month after the "July 7th Incident" occurs, he returns to Shanghai amidst the flames of war. Upon arriving in China, he smoothly participates in the war and, like a miracle, immediately receives "important appointments" from Chairman Chiang, traveling as a special envoy to the Northwest by plane, where he meets En-lai and travels back and forth between the North and South. He is written as a low-IQ and thoughtless fellow.</p>
<p>The setting of this story is quite "grand," encompassing major events in China over the last ten years. From the Northern Expedition of 1927, through the "September 18th Incident," "July 7th Incident," "August 13th Incident," and to the united front against the Japanese invasion. On the Japanese side, she describes the thoughts and lives of Japanese youth, women, families, and warlords.</p>
<p>But since the author had such grand ambitions to narrate this great story, she should have had a sufficient understanding of the above events, and at the very least, she shouldn't have spread rumors and misunderstandings. She also should have grasped the core of her depiction. However, the author neither understood the Chinese revolution nor did she focus on key issues, lightly brushing over the major events in a few words, without mentioning the significance and circumstances of these events. Instead, she drew out the romance of I-fan pursuing Mr. Muraki's daughter—Wangzi—in Japan, windingly stretching it to occupy the majority of the entire book. Although the remaining small portion describes the Northern Expedition and other events, her descriptions are full of ignorance, rumors, and, strictly speaking, are simply an insult to China.</p>
<p>Here, let me extract a few passages below to see what kind of "patriot" Ms. Pearl Buck portrays. At the same time, I must state that this is not taking things out of context, because these are all the author's own words, and I am only transcribing them truthfully.</p>
<p>"Three hundred Japanese—men, women, and children—were killed by Chinese soldiers in a small town near Beiping... Revenge, Japanese soldiers should retaliate wildly against the peaceful city of Beiping!" The author presents the Tongzhou Incident in this way, omitting the fundamental reasons that triggered the event.</p>
<p>"Chinese people help the Japanese; Chinese planes bomb Shanghai!" Joke, a Chinese pilot mistook a Japanese target and mistakenly dropped his bombs on a busy street, killing hundreds of people." The author does not describe the world-shaking large-scale bloody battle, but instead picks this unfortunate event and satirizes it.</p>
<p>This is the author's description of the Chinese air force:</p>
<p>"Actually, I-fan," I-ke said to her younger brother: "Japan is attacking us in every aspect. In the air force... It's a joke that a woman leads the air force. Which country uses a woman to lead the air force?..." The author seems to be blind, as she seems to know nothing about the Chinese flying generals using their own flesh and blood and bombs to sink enemy warships. Although she cleverly uses the mouths of the Chinese themselves to say bad things about China, we must understand who is holding the pen.</p>
<p>This is how she writes about the Chinese army:</p>
<p>"I don't see that he (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) has any plans. When I left Germany, I thought that after returning to China, I would naturally join the organized national army. What did I find? A large group of untrained soldiers, each group only obeying their small leaders, with no national concept at all..."</p>
<p>Even more shameless is her fabrication of how the Eighth Route Army treats prisoners. Everyone knows that they treat prisoners quite well. But she writes:</p>
<p>"...The soldiers under En-lai's command have a habit of killing all prisoners... Their way of having fun is to lock them in cages or tie them to branches... and stab them with bundles of dry grass or burn them with fire..."</p>
<p>Okay, I don't want to extract any more passages, because this kind of distortion of facts, containing malice (this is what I think), can be readily extracted from the entire book.</p>
<p>In short, this is a book containing poison, and all righteous cultural people should expose it.</p>
<p>Finally, I feel deeply surprised that such a book actually has three translated versions being published on the same day, competing with each other, and mobilizing a large number of cultural figures to translate rumors and promote it. I think this is because half are superstitious about the author's name, and half are driven by the "business sense" of the publishers. After it is published, everyone feels regret.</p>
<p>I hope that in the future, translations should be carefully reviewed in advance, otherwise, it will be like the World event satirized by the author, where we use bombs to bomb ourselves.</p>
<h3>Ancient City</h3>
<p>— Li Qiao</p>
<p>A Memoir of the Breakout from Xuzhou</p>
<p>It was said that the ancient city was only twenty *li* away, but we didn't arrive at this ancient place of lodging, enveloped in twilight, until dusk.</p>
<p>Dragging my aching feet, I stepped into the ancient city, which was shrouded in the twilight and surrounded by green trees, seeming so quiet and secluded. Suddenly, a wisp of leisurely thought floated into my mind: Is this the ancient city that Zhang Yide defended? I remember the picture in *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* when I was a child, when Guan Yu beheaded Cai Yang, Zhang Yide was squatting on the tower of the ancient city, beating the drums to cheer him on. Could it be that the tall General Zhang could also squat on the low, fenced gatehouse that I just crossed? —Maybe this city gate is not the original city gate, but is this city really the ancient city that Zhang Yide defended? Please, archaeologists, examine it!</p>
<p>This city is just a market town with two or three hundred households, under the jurisdiction of Haozhou. It seems to be quite lively on ordinary days, but now it has been visited by brutal airplanes several times, and the people have been bombed away. The city is full of frightening desolation. The houses on both sides of the street are completely closed. Even the dogs don't know where they have fled with their owners, and there isn't even a welcoming bark. In the thin darkness of the night, only a few bats spread their black wings, flying quickly back and forth, as if they were playing games in place of the children.</p>
<p>We found a spacious empty house and lay down without any cover.</p>
<p>"Order!" Someone knocked on the door outside.</p>
<p>The door opened, and a messenger walked in:</p>
<p>"The division commander's order: Comrade Yang is to quickly go to Haozhou to scout. Has our dispersed team from the road reached Haozhou? Quickly make contact with them..."</p>
<p>The messenger walked out, and Comrade Yang, who was sleeping on the bed, jumped out of bed, scratching his head:</p>
<p>"How can I go in this dark night? And I've never been to Haozhou..."</p>
<p>At that time, Haozhou was in the midst of fighting, but could he not go?</p>
<p>After hesitating for a while, Comrade Yang changed into civilian clothes and set out with a guide.</p>
<p>Not long after the people in the house went back to sleep, another order was delivered:</p>
<p>——Depart at four o'clock tonight, destination Qiuchu Settlement...</p>
<p>Before dawn, the mixed crowd of people and horses came out of each room, the sound of horses' hooves, the clinking of water bottles and bayonets, the heavy footsteps... mixed together, resounding in the sleeping ancient city. The stiff, dead ancient city seemed to come back to life!</p>
<h3>Also "Safety First"</h3>
<h3>(6) A Life Entrusted</h3>
<p>— Sang</p>
<p>Once, there was a famous violinist who wanted to auction off his valuable violin, opening the price at five hundred yuan, but no one inquired. So he lowered the price to three hundred yuan, two hundred yuan, fifty yuan, and even ten yuan, but still couldn't sell it. At that moment, the violinist ran to the stage and used that seemingly worthless violin to perform a famous piece. The audience listened quietly to the music, as if they had never heard it before. The sound of the violin was gentle and moving, as if lamenting that there were no kindred spirits in the vast crowd. At the end of the piece, the performer returned the violin to the auctioneer and returned to his seat. Soon after, in the tense atmosphere, a commotion arose in the crowd. It turned out that someone was now willing to pay a thousand yuan to buy the violin. But wasn't this violin the same one that was offered at ten yuan without anyone inquiring? Why did the value of the violin later reach a thousand yuan? Simply because the violin was in the hands of the violinist, it revealed the nobility of its quality! Recently, many people, because of being immersed in sin, have fallen into disrepair, are despised by the public, and are deemed unusable. But because they pulled back from the edge of the cliff and submitted to Jesus, entrusting their bodies to God, they have now completely changed their past errant lives! To be honest, among Christians around the world, there are countless examples like the ones mentioned above. All those who wish to sever old habits and seek the realization of new life, please pay attention! —Shanghai Christian Literature Society Mailing Box 1227.</p>
<h3>Travel Impressions (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Li Jinming</p>
<p>The ushering monk led us through the Buddhist hall, heading west, through a door, directly to a guest hall that was still neatly furnished. Inside the hall, there were eight armchairs, a clean red-lacquered table, vases, incense burners, rattan beds, bamboo backrests, gilded couplets... Four guests had arrived before us, as if preparing to stay for a long time.</p>
<p>Hearing that guests who didn't ride sedan chairs also wanted a good room, a plump monk in his forties came out, seeming somewhat displeased. Without speaking, he led us to two rooms behind the guest hall. I said, "It's too dark and not well-ventilated here," so he led us to two rooms facing the front with windows facing outward. This monk had thick, erect eyebrows, greedy eyes, and his face almost carried a fierce look. When he unintentionally heard Da Peng say, "Oh, there's also a signature from He × here. He × is someone I know," (because He × is an important person in this place), his face immediately displayed a smile. He bent his back, stretched out his hands, and made a "please sit, please sit" gesture. (It turned out that He × was a devout Buddhist.)</p>
<p>Before long, tea and refreshments were placed in the guest hall. This fierce-faced monk, who called himself Zen Master Yuan Geng, hurriedly came to invite us to take our seats. The tea and water were undoubtedly of high quality, and the refreshments were enough to make a native of Hunan who had been traveling abroad for many years recall the flavors of his hometown. Foods such as mint cakes, pomelo peel candy, cloud roll pastries, and *Liriope spicata* roots had once made wandering people drool even in their dreams. Now, back in Hunan, these things aren't worth much, but instead of eating enough of them in the city, we have to climb this isolated mountain temple to taste one or two slices, pretending to be guests. Perhaps this is a shortcoming of being human. The monk, seeing my appearance, was somewhat contemptuous.</p>
<p>In this big mountain, aside from coarse red rice, sweet potatoes, green vegetables, bamboo shoots, spring water, and air, everything is valuable. It's not easy to transport goods up here. The fact that they brought something out to treat guests shows that they regard the guests as sacred, because the life of the Bodhisattva also depends on the expenses of the guests. But the old monk has a lot of fields. It is said that the land within six or seventy *li* around Mount Heng belongs to the temple. Because there are so many fields, and enough monks to raise, they show their status and make the wealthy travelers feel insignificant. As the saying goes, with sufficient food and clothing, one knows honor and shame. It's unavoidable that the monks of Shangfeng Temple have some snobbishness.</p>
<p>After the tea was cleared away, we went to the room. The fierce-faced monk followed us, holding a "title inscription booklet" in his hand, begging us to leave some verses on it. He proudly took out a small cloth bag from his pocket, and took out a round, clean, peach-red stone from the cloth bag, pointing and saying:</p>
<p>"You understand physics, take a look at whether this thing is worth a piece of real Hetian jade? Above—this is a dragon, this is a tiger, the dragon coils, and the tiger crouches, as if it were man-made. Is this worth a piece of Hetian jade?"</p>
<h3>Afterthoughts</h3>
<p>— Editor</p>
<p>I finally finished reading Pearl S. Buck's "The Patriot," which caused quite a stir. However, the impression we got is almost the same as that of Mr. Lin Ying. We only felt that it was worthless in terms of content and technique, but just selling some Eastern people's superficial knowledge to Westerners like a headhunter! As for the places where she deliberately slandered us, no matter what her, Pearl S. Buck's, motives were, I think they are always unforgivable, because this was unnecessary and could have been avoided.</p>

<p>If this road doesn't work, then stop.</p>
<p>I don't believe there's anyone in the world who doesn't drink sweet wine,</p>
<p>A broken cart, a broken spear, a broken bow, are also the sound of horns.</p>
<p>Yesterday, today, tomorrow, sunrise to sunset,</p>
<p>Blue arrow pointing the way, back on a new path.</p>
<p>The past fate is forever a confession,</p>

<h3>The Life of Electric Bulb Workers</h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>Thanks to the introduction of a friend, I had the opportunity to visit the actual working conditions of an electric bulb factory and interview the male and female workers there in detail about their lives. Below is a description of the living conditions of the workers in various departments that I learned from my interviews there:</p>
<p>"S"-Pickers</p>
<p>The filament in the small light bulb, the shape of its setup, is like the letter "S", so picking filaments is generally referred to by electric bulb workers as "picking S". This work is done by female workers, and their ages are all around fifteen to twenty-five, because only such young women have the patience and can be meticulous and attentive to do this job well. This is an extremely long and extremely fine steel wire. After being tempered and sheared by engineers using scientific methods, this filament, which is suitable for assembling on electric bulbs, must be sorted and selected. They need to have sharp eyesight, otherwise this tiny "S" is almost impossible to see. Therefore, this work is extremely taxing on eyesight and brainpower. All day long, crouching at the desk often makes them dizzy, lightheaded, and backache! Although their wages are slightly higher than those of ordinary female workers, they can only earn five or six *jiao* to seven or eight *jiao* a day.</p>
<p>"S"-Makers</p>
<p>This involves gluing two filaments together with molten glass tubes, and it is the work of male workers. They sit next to intense gas furnaces all day long, working constantly. Whether it is winter or summer, they are always covered in sweat, and their clothes are soaked! Their suffocation and discomfort are no different from those of blacksmiths next to a large furnace. They are among the more arduous types of workers in all departments. However, their wages are extremely limited, with the higher ones only earning about the same as the "S"-picking ladies.</p>
<p>Bulb-Blowers</p>
<p>This department is staffed by male and female child laborers. Their ages are mostly around ten to fourteen years old. Their work is even more painful than that of the "S"-making workers! Because they work next to intense gas furnaces all day long, and they have to hold extremely hot glass tubes in their mouths, sucking and blowing at the flames. Blowing and sucking until the molten glass forms the shape of a bulb. Because they are still in the learning stage, their wages are even more meager, only one to three yuan per month.</p>
<p>Air Extractors</p>
<p>This is a department staffed by important workers. They must have scientific and chemical knowledge. That is, after the glass bulb is blown, its air must be extracted using chemicals and scientific methods before the copper head and filament can be assembled. Their wages are generally higher than those of ordinary male and female workers, generally from forty to seventy or eighty yuan per month.</p>
<p>Plaster Gluers</p>
<p>The copper head must be glued to the top of the bulb with plaster. This is also a department for female workers, both old and young. Their wages are calculated based on a contract system, at two to three *jiao* per thousand. Therefore, although their work is relatively easy, their income can still reach from ten to twenty yuan per month.</p>
<p>Solderers</p>
<p>To firmly connect the "S" and the copper head, in addition to the adhesion of the plaster, it is also necessary to soak the top with tin. Because this is a relatively easy part, it is only done by male child laborers who are slightly older. But their hardship is not much different from that of "S"-makers and bulb-blowers. Their wages are four to six or seven yuan per month.</p>
<p>Bulb-Pickers</p>
<p>This is the easiest part of all departments, requiring only the selection of bulbs with damage marks. This is done by the female workers and child laborers who first entered the factory, and the wages are only one to three yuan. In addition, there are also contract systems (limited to female workers), or temporary employees, who earn three *fen* per thousand bulbs picked, earning three to five *jiao* a day.</p>

<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 12: The Beauty's Revenge Can't Erase Sinister Karma, Loving Words at the Green Window Renew a Fated Match</p>
<p>The house had an upper floor, and the old servant went upstairs to report to his master. Pan Peiying listened carefully, hearing the voices of women and children, but she couldn't make out what they were saying. In less than five minutes, she heard the sound of the staircase creaking. Zhao Letian, leaning on two crutches, walked in. When Pan Peiying saw him, she couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness, and tears welled up in her eyes, thinking: How could such a good person only have one leg? But Zhao Letian had a face full of joy, his face covered in smiles, as if he was very welcoming to her, saying: "It's rare! It's rare! Ms. Pan! How could you think of an old friend and come to see me?" Pan Peiying, with a slightly choked voice, said: "I... I... I only found out about your whereabouts yesterday, and only then did I know that you were not dead." Zhao Letian said: "Who told you I was dead? At first, I thought I was dead, but I didn't expect to only lose a leg." Pan Peiying said: "At first, the newspapers all reported that you had died in this nocturnal attack, and they all said that you had sacrificed yourself for the country. Until yesterday, I thought that I would never see you again." Zhao Letian was still very attentive, very happy, and invited Pan Peiying to sit down, and sat across from her himself, asking: "Then who told you that I was not dead?" He smiled and said, "So what if we meet again?" Pan Peiying said: "Until yesterday, I was playing in Huishan, and I met Yuan Shuwen, and only then did I know that you were still alive. The reason why I wanted to see you was because I wanted to express my heart to you once. When you wrote a letter asking me to persuade my father not to fall into their pack of foxes and dogs. Who knew that this letter would fall into my father's hands. At that time, he forced me to write this letter rejecting you, but he put forward two conditions. One was to break off contact with you, and the other was to secretly send the military police to arrest you. They knew your address, and it was easy to arrest you. At that time, I felt that you were in great danger, so I would rather agree to the first condition and break off contact with you. Because we knew each other's hearts, I changed our usual terms of address in this letter. I thought that you might know that I was being coerced. I thought that even if you couldn't guess it at the time, I could write to you and deny that the previous letter was not my original intention. Who knew that they were monitoring me very strictly, and I couldn't move at all. But I thought that we were both young, and there would always be a day when we would meet, and this situation would not last long after all. I didn't expect a bolt from the blue, and you sacrificed yourself for the country. This made it impossible for me to express my heart, which was so cruel!" (142)</p>
<h3>A Visit to a Soap Making Demonstration</h3>
<p>— (Zhang Zhenshan)</p>
<p>It is undeniable that the efficiency of industrial production in Shanghai's Chinese industrial circles is inferior to that of foreign merchants in Shanghai. In recent years, there has been a phenomenon of rapid catching up, but there is still a distance to catch up, not to mention competition, and it is still difficult to control one's own market. The reasons for this are naturally not just one, but the main one is that production education has not been popularized, and there is a lack of general talent. Therefore, irrigating knowledge of industrial production is indeed necessary, especially in the urban areas of Shanghai, where there are plenty of unemployed people.</p>
<p>The Yong'an Company is now using a special location in its store to demonstrate soap making. Although the motive is to promote business and increase the sales of its products, this motive is still very good. It can invisibly benefit those who want to engage in industrial production, and at the same time, it can point out a way for the unemployed to make a living. Therefore, after visiting, I wrote this record.</p>
<p>A small machine is divided into five groups, which are managed by two young female employees respectively. When the horn announces the start of the demonstration, the initial action is to pour crushed soap pieces into the first group of mixers, and then add a little essence, and then start the motor. There is an axis inside this mixer, and the axis is equipped with curved leaves. The unfinished soap material is stirred inside due to the repeated rotation of the leaves. After stirring evenly, it is transferred to the second group of grinders. Start the motor to make the machine wheels rotate continuously, and the dry crushed soap flakes inside will gradually condense into a noodle shape. After multiple grinding, it is replaced with a spiral extrusion machine. After the soap material is poured in from the inlet, it is extruded from the outlet through the pressure of the machine in the form of strips. Long strips are then cut into small pieces by a cutting machine, and each one is placed on a printing machine, printed into a suitable shape and pattern, and then wrapped in paper. The entire project is completed.</p>
<p>However, this soap-making process is only a specific and miniature image. If it is manufactured and sold, its quality and manufacturing techniques must be appropriately expanded. Moreover, this miniature performance does not show the mixing of raw materials. Therefore, I will write down the names and dosages of the raw materials I know below:</p>
<p>To make ordinary soap, you only need to use 100 parts of fat (Eatty) (beef fat, lard, mutton, bird, vegetable oil can be used); Caustic soda (Sodiun Caustie); 20 parts; 150 parts of water; and a little resin (Resins); Rosin; Coconut oil (Cocoa Nat Oil); The configuration of these raw materials must be appropriately adjusted according to the required amount. If the soap needs to be easily hardened, add a few parts of sodium carbonate crystal (Sodiumnate Crystal).</p>
<p>In addition, there are many types and colors of soap, for example: ordinary soap, scented soap, fatty soap, resin soap, medicated soap, transparent soap, bleaching soap, red, brown, yellow, green, white, etc. The production of these types and the appropriate blending of colors must have sufficient experience to be able to handle with ease, such as: how many raw materials and silver beads should be added to red soap to show the desired color.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, it is really unknown how many unemployed people there are. Friends who wander around all day and are at a loss, may wish to try it out, because soap is one of the most important daily necessities, and its sales volume is difficult to describe. If you use a little capital to make and sell it yourself in your home, you may be able to make a living. However, if you are engaged in it with a small amount of capital, it is best to specialize in ordinary soap, because ordinary soap is easier to make, and there are more targets for peddling, so sales will naturally develop easily. Now that the company is publicly performing, it is a learning opportunity that does not cost a penny.</p>

<h3>Two Films Worthy of Attention</h3>
<p>— Lone Star</p>
<p>"The Hopes of Britannia" from Britain</p>
<p>British Progressive Films, in collaboration with several other companies, has recently completed a film called "The Hopes of Britannia." The film depicts the Chamberlain government's cold indifference to the suffering endured by British merchant ships and sailors at the hands of Franco during the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>This film fully exposes the damage suffered by the British Empire in the Spanish Civil War. Through scenes of aerial bombardment and various charts, it illustrates that British trade routes are all within the radius of the German and Italian airfields on the Spanish coast, and that the power over their life and death has long since shifted from the hands of the British to those of the Germans and Italians.</p>
<p>It also explains that the Strait of Gibraltar has been surrounded by long-range Nazi artillery, and that planes flying from German and Italian airfields in Spain or Africa constantly threaten to cut off all British foreign trade routes.</p>
<p>The film was banned by the British film censorship authorities during its review, and has sparked protests and criticisms from the film and public opinion circles. However, despite the protests and criticisms, the ban remains in place!</p>
<p>The Soviet Union's "If War Comes"</p>
<p>The production of the new Soviet film "If War Comes" is a comprehensive response from the Soviet authorities to those who generally belittle Soviet strength. This is because rumors have been intentionally spread internationally that the Soviet Union's national power is insufficient and that the Soviet Union's position will not be important in a decisive war. Now, the public release of "If War Comes" is presenting a powerful rebuttal to those who spread and believe these rumors.</p>
<p>The film depicts the Soviet Union suddenly attacked by a certain powerful country in Western Europe, thus leading to war. However, the war ends very quickly. By the end of the film, the enemy's capital has been occupied by the Soviet Red Army, and countless enemy officers have been taken prisoner. The film depicts this war as being extremely easy to win. Cavalry charging with bayonets, high-speed tanks, incredibly powerful heavy bombers, and long-range Soviet artillery, with a leisurely and effortless air, shatter the enemy's dreams of invasion. Some of the war scenes are taken from training newsreels. The greatest scene is of a large number of Red Army soldiers jumping from airplanes with parachutes, appearing behind enemy lines and posing a very significant threat to the enemy.</p>
<p>"If War Comes" is a standard military propaganda film, but it only says two things: To the Soviet people, it says: "Rest assured!" To other countries, it says: "If you come to attack, we will respond immediately, and the battlefield will be on your territory!"</p>
<p>Merle Oberon is having a great time in "Wuthering Heights." Look how beautiful her expression is!</p>
<h3>Recent Developments in Various Peking Opera Troupes in Beiping</h3>
<p>— Yan Yan</p>
<p>Beiping is the birthplace of Peking Opera, with numerous opera schools established. They are all working hard to cultivate future talent for the sake of Peking Opera's future. For example, Mao Shilai, Li Shifang, and Sha Shixin from the Dangliancheng troupe, and Song Dezhu, Wang Jinlu, and Fu Dewei from the Opera School, are all outstanding talents who have graduated recently. The recent developments in various opera schools are reported separately below:</p>
<p>Fu Liancheng Society</p>
<p>The Fu Liancheng Society is currently the oldest opera school in Beiping. Its students, who graduated from the Xi, Lian, Fu, and Sheng classes, have performed in various places and have received extremely high praise. Most of the students from the "Shi" class have also graduated. Recently, the students in the society have been named with the character "Yuan." After "Yuan," the four characters "Yun Qing Fu Lai" have been decided. The top students in the Yuan class include Liu Yuantong and Huang Yuanqing, but there are very few of them. During this period of transition, its performances in various theaters are entirely based on the new plays of the famous comic actor Ye Shengzhang to attract audiences. For example, plays such as "The Drunken Beggar" and "Juan Juan" are all personal masterpieces of Shengzhang. Recently, a new play "Ouyang De" has been staged, and the first part has already been performed and has been extremely well-received. They are now working on the second part, which is scheduled to be performed this month.</p>
<p>Opera School</p>
<p>The students of the Beiping Opera School are divided into eight classes. Currently, only the first four classes are graduating, arranged in the order of the four characters "De He Jin Yu." Female students are identified by a grass radical on the third character. The school was established in 1930 and has a short history, but it cannot be said that it has trained few talents. Those who have already graduated, such as Song Dezhu, Chuan Dewei, and Zhao Jinrong, all have very good reputations. Recently, another group of students will graduate on August 1, including Wang Jinlu, Wang Helin, and Li Hezeng. Currently, there are rising talents in the school, such as Qingyi actress Li Yuru, civil and military Laosheng actor Zhang Yuchan, long-bearded Wusheng actor Hu Jintao, and Wudan actress Li Jinhong. There is no immediate cause for concern about a shortage of talent. Performances in various theaters are also promoted using new plays, such as "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" written by Weng Ouhong, which is the most prominent example. Other plays that have already been performed include "Three Women's Jealousy," and those that are being rehearsed and are about to be performed include "Marriage Tragedy" and "Loyal and Righteous Heroes."</p>
<p>Rong Chun Society</p>
<p>The Rong Chun Society is organized by the famous Dan actress Shang Xiaoyun. The president is Zhao Yankui. Currently, there are more than 300 students, among whom Shang Changchun's Wusheng and Xu Rongkui's Xusheng have achieved more success. Although the society was established not long ago, it has a certain audience because of its hard work. However, it relies entirely on new plays to attract audiences. The number of new plays it has performed is no less than several dozen. Currently, it is rushing to rehearse the play "Romance of the Barbarian King," which is a variation of the story of Zhuge Liang Capturing Meng Huo Seven Times. The roles have been assigned, with Shang Changchun playing Meng Huo, Xu Rongkui playing Zhuge Liang, and Tian Rongfen playing Lady Zhurong. It is scheduled to be performed this month. Following that is a seasonal play called "The Eight Mixed Yuan Boxes." All the stage routines are based on Shang Xiaoyun's own blueprint, and it is prepared to be performed during the Dragon Boat Festival to add to the festive atmosphere.</p>
<h3>The Stage Costumes of Pinghua Storyteller Wang Baolan</h3>
<h3>Unofficial Records of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Fall of Woh Yun Chu Shih and the Rise of Li Duokui</p>
<p>After the death of the old master Gong Yunfu, everyone knew that Li Duokui could inherit his mantle. In fact, in terms of qualifications, singing, acting, and reciting, the most qualified successor of the Gong style should be Woh Yun Chu Shih, followed by Duokui. Woh Yun is also of Banner origin, originally named Yu Jing. After the Republic of China, he changed his surname to Zhao. He is now nearly fifty years old. He attended the Noble School during the late Qing Dynasty. From a young age, he was addicted to opera and loved to study Gong Yunfu's style. Therefore, he deeply understood Gong Yunfu's actions, expressions, singing, and reciting. Others who learn from Gong Yunfu only roughly imitate his appearance, but Woh Yun can imitate his sitting, walking, gaze, a raising of his hand, and a flick of his sleeve completely accurately. He often said: Gong Yunfu mostly sits with his body turned to the side. This is like taking a photograph. If you sit upright with your back straight, the photo will not look good; it will also look too unnatural. Gong Yunfu not only slightly turns his body, but also places one foot on the crossbar under the chair and hooks the other behind the first. Those watching from the audience can only see the tip of one foot, slightly revealing the yellow cloud-patterned shoe and snow-white cloth sock. This is much better than letting people see the old lady's two big feet. This is a very small detail, but Chu Shih can imitate it vividly, which shows that he really put in a lot of effort to study Gong Yunfu's style privately. He often performed "Hanging," "Six Halls," "Scolding Cao," and "Visiting Mother" in various private performances, which was highly praised by the audience. Therefore, he worked even harder to study Gong Yunfu's plays. As a result, he was already very famous in the early years of the Republic of China. After the revolution, most Banner people suffered from economic pressure. Since he had a skill, he became a student of Gong Yunfu and officially became an actor. —(42)—</p>
<h3>Celebrating the Dragon Boat Festival with Stage Performances of "Legend of the White Snake"</h3>
<p>— Haisheng</p>
<p>Today is the Dragon Boat Festival. As in the past, various theaters are staging "Legend of the White Snake." Although the lunar calendar has been abolished for a long time, people still cannot avoid following customs, and it is laughable to say that it is to celebrate the holiday. The arrangements for this play at various theaters in Shanghai are recorded below.</p>
<p>Great Stage</p>
<p>The play was rehearsed last night. In addition to Chen Xiaomu, Li Ruilai, and Li Junyu, who are playing Xu Xian, the Monkey King Zhang Yipeng also joined in cross-dressing. Bai Niangniang is played by Wang Yaoqin, Yu Xiuxia, and Little White Peony. Little Qing is specially played by the rising beautiful Kun Dan Fu Juying. This actress is excellent in both beauty and art, and is highly valued by the management. Therefore, she has been practicing martial arts diligently recently, so that she can show off her skills in "Legend of the White Snake." If the performance is successful, it is hoped that she will stand out.</p>
<p>Co-Stage</p>
<p>This theater is famous for this play. It is currently being staged by Zhou Fengwen, Ge Huaqing, and Lu Wenyi. The roles have been assigned early: Wang Chunbai, Jiang Xiaolou, Pan Dingxin, and Little Zhao Junyu play Xu Xian; Mao Jianqiu, Li Xuefang, Pink Peony, and Zhao Junyan play Bai Niangniang; Yu Mudan, White Peony, Shen Yanqin, and Xiao Linghong play Little Qing. Chen Yuelou, the backstage manager of the theater, who has not performed for many years, has also joined in as Chen Biao, and will perform with a real python when subduing Bai Niangniang, which is thrilling and eye-catching.</p>
<p>Tianchan Stage</p>
<p>When the second part of "Seven Swords and Thirteen Heroes" was being rehearsed the night before last, this play was also rehearsed. Today, it will be performed in two parts, day and night. The lead roles are Liu Hanchen and Sun Pengzhi as Xu Xian, Xue Youqin as Bai Niangniang, and Xie Wenqin as Little Qing.</p>
<p>Carlton</p>
<p>The Yifeng Opera Troupe is staging a play called "Leifeng Pagoda," which will be performed at the daytime performance today along with "Dong Xiaowan." "Fifteen or Sixteen Chapters of Tian Yu Hua" were rehearsed the night before last, and this play was also rehearsed at the same time. Liu Wenkui and Ge Juejiang play Xu Xian; Jin Suwen, Zhang Huicong, Ma Jinfeng, and Qian Shumin play Bai Niangniang; Wang Lanfang, Li Suqiu, and Yang Yanrong play Little Qing. Xin Fang and Xichun are not participating, and it is just for decoration.</p>
<p>Many Peking Opera troupes in the Amusement Park are staging "Legend of the White Snake," so details are not included.</p>
<h3>Charity Performance for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's local group has been publicizing its broadcasting and charity performances for a long time. In addition to holding a grand broadcast at the Continental Radio Station on the 17th and 18th, it will also hold charity performances at the Golden Grand Theater on the 26th and 27th of this month, with a total of four performances, day and night. Famous amateur actors from other places who have already joined include Zeng Xinzhai, Zhu Bonian, Ou Shounan, Zhuang Xiaogu, and Li Zaitian. Ladies Wei Xinlu, Xiao Ming, and Fu Yuntai, as well as famous amateur actors from the local Ju Society and Ping Society, are also participating. Amateur actors from other places with drama experience and famous local amateur actors who are happy to participate in the charity performances or broadcasting to jointly support the cause are all welcome. Please contact Mr. Wu Zezhou at 5 Daodeli, Luxon Road, Foch Road. Your participation is greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3>The Golden Dragon Boat</h3>
<p>Outside Gengshan Gate in Hangzhou, about ten miles outside the city, there is a mountain called Banshan (Half Mountain), and on the mountain is the Niu Shan Niangniang Temple (Cow Mountain Goddess Temple). Every year from the first day of the fifth lunar month to the tenth, there is a dragon boat race. This year it is the most lively, and there are many spectators. One boat, in particular, has banners that shine and colors that are dazzling. The boats compete to be first, and people point and count them. There are eighteen boats. At noon, they go ashore to eat, and the count is only seventeen boats. Everyone saw that there were eighteen boats, so why is one missing? After eating, they go back to the water to race, and there are eighteen boats again. A local who knows how to swim goes into the water and identifies the brightly colored boat, hurrying forward to ask about its origin. Just as he gets in front of it and grabs an oar, the boat disappears. The oar is still in his hand. He lifts it up and sees that it is made of pure gold. He counts again, and there are only seventeen boats. It turns out that the missing boat is the Golden Dragon Boat.</p>
<h3>Rhyme About Zongzi (Rice Dumpling) Wrappers</h3>
<p>Zongzi cannot be made without bamboo leaves, but when eating them, the wrappers are discarded. I saw this and felt moved, so I wrote three seven-character regulated verses, hoping that like-minded people will respond with their own poems. - Draft by a humble old man from western Zhejiang</p>
<p>(1) Through many bindings and windings, with sharp edges and corners, its nature is unique; it exerts itself without knowing that it is just a leaf, cherishing only its perceived value like a pearl. It comes together to harmonize water and fire, hoping to be soaked in grease and oil; the colorful threads and lucky charms are untied together, casually discarded before the feast. (2) Intentionally encompassing hardship, containing sustenance to nourish and fill the people; ultimately yielding soft and delicious grains on the plate, without understanding the world beyond the pot. Suddenly thinking of Guan Zhong and Kuai Kui, without the distinction to offer water chestnuts or water lilies on the pond; enjoying the pleasure of forgetting the trap once the fish is caught, its cause being to fall into the latrine or float on a mat. (3) The pot heats up, often burning beanstalks, boiling the life like a chicken a hundred and one times; why is it necessary to serve the mouth like that, when appearance and fur are insignificant? Knowing from the beginning that it is not a discarded object, perhaps fine silk is embroidered on tender hands; six zhang and five corners are familiar to me, given to the poet to carefully contemplate.</p>
