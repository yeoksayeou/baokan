<p>社評</p>
<h3>暹羅與今日之國際</h3>
<p>昨日香港電稱：「此間近忽盛傳暹羅有加入德義日防共同盟之消息，人心大為震動，蓋暹羅若果加入同盟，則英法在遠東之地位，勢必大形削弱也；但據此間私人所得曼谷電訉，則謂暹政府，對於加入防共同盟之說，已出而闢謠，且斥為無稽之談云」。此私人電訉也。昨夜又接倫敦電稱：「盛傳暹羅業已加入反共國際公的之說，茲由暹羅駐英使館予以堅決吾認」，是可徵信矣。在此國際危機四伏，險象環生之際，暹羅動態，輒爲世人所忽視；顧暹羅之地位非可忽視，若國際而發生大戰，則關係允重。暹羅國領土廣袤的五十三萬平方公里，較之中國之西康省略大；人口的一千二百五十萬，較之中國之廣西省略少，而華僑二百五十萬人，復居其總數五之一；蓋非大國也。宗信佛敎，僧侶最有聲勢，平民務農者十之八，文化水準不高，政局安定纔三五載，財政不裕，軍力不充，復非强國也。位於中國之西南，自雲南昆明垂直而南，乃彼國都盤谷；東北與法屬安雨接壤，西北與英屬緬甸毘連，東濱海稱暹羅灣，西濱海稱孟加拉灣，南爲英屬馬來聯邦，即英國遠東海軍大本營新加坡軍港之母體；故其國不大不强，而實處强大之間。然則何爲而日亂世允不可忽視？蓋獨立國有其生命，有其力量，有其意識；而遠東獨立國家，惟中國日本與暹羅。暹羅獨力不足以左右遠束大局，而其左右袒，足爲左右重。暹羅而與英法歡好無間，則英法無求於暹羅；暹羅若結强有力之奧援而與英法敵對，則爲英法遠東勢力肘腋之患；新加坡軍港雖强固，得憑藉暹羅而拊新加坡之背；鑿暹羅蜂腰而爲「克拉」運河，以媾通太平洋與印度洋，則不但新加坡不復成爲東西鎖鑰，即印度庫藏亦可得而覬覦焉。謂可忽視耶？日人籠絡暹羅，以歡笑，以禮貌，以子女玉帛，以阿彌陀佛，無微不至，由來久矣。暹羅加入反共公的之說，亦爲數月來所頻傳，蛛絲馬跡，並非無因；故隔昨謂業已加入，初未可視爲突兀；且與竭力壓迫華僑，封閉學校，搜查銀行，同時並傳；港電謂人心因此大爲震動，宜也。今幸證明所傳不確，張伯倫氏殆已飽受虛驚矣乎？</p>
<p>雖然，事有不可不論者：暹羅業已加入反共國際公的說之不可信，無待倫敦香港之公私電證；時有未至，勢所不許也。何也？暹羅雖爲獨立國家，應有自由意識，然介乎數强之間，左右爲難，未可自由發揮其意識；値此國際混沌，友敵縱橫，一切分野將定未定之時，暹羅反共意識即使充溢乎朝野，安有先自選定友敵，註定運命，而亟亟加入反共公的之理？蓋英法對暹羅，未聞有何兼併之圖；而英國於新加坡軍港將决完成之時，允擬貸暹鉅款，俾彼充實軍備，友誼良不惡也。况在今茲，日本既無經營暹羅之餘晷，復無保障暹羅之餘力，更非憑藉暹羅以宰割英法之時機，若暹羅貿然加入侵略集團，使他日之安南緬甸馬來直接蒙其威脅，資源所在之印度與軍略重鎭之新加坡、間接爲所動搖，則英法之決不養癰成患而必以爭着先鞭爲得計，是可斷言；且此時此勢，洵屬易如探囊；是爲暹羅所熟知，而必不願取禍於當前。於是可知業已加入之說爲不可信。</p>
<p>謂暹羅於反共國際公的決不加入，且永不加入，而香港倫敦儘可無虞於暹羅；是又不然，且必不然。此其關鍵，不在暹羅之意識將如何自由取舍從違；而在暹羅國際環境之如何演變。國際若發生大戰，則暹羅之左右袒可以影響軍事之一部分，失暹羅者，必受暹羅之累，故曰不可忽視暹羅，然此非所語於今茲。事在今茲，大戰未作，則暹羅雖嫉華僑，虐華僑，然暹羅之對英對日，爲友爲敵，必視中國抗戰之勝敗爲轉移；申言之，暹羅新定其國名曰「泰」；「泰」詁自由，顧其能吾介乎英法勢力之間而維繫其爲泰國，抑將不免於侵略之凶鋒，淪爲附庸，徒成侵略者南進之梯堦，惟視中國抗戰之勝敗爲轉移。中國抗戰不勝，『英法在遠東之地位勢必大形削弱』，暹羅在脅誘之下，雖不願加入反共國際公的而不可得，英法雖反對彼之加入而不可得；香港安南非復英法所有，自不待言。即緬甸印度欲得暹羅爲緩衝爲障蔽而不可得。蓋必中國勝。遠東始安定，國際始有秩序，始有共守之法則：而暹羅亦必保持其光榮歷史而爲獨立之泰國，故今日之倫敦香港，殊不必憂喜於暹羅之是吾加入反共國際公的，但須注意中日戰爭之勝敗！</p>

<p>（倫敦）每日電報稱、美國對於菲列濱羣島之關係、將爲美國政治中之嚴重問題、如美國果實行其所已宣布於一九四六年成立獨立的菲列濱共和國之意旨、則將造成菲島爲日本侵略之惡果、此誠非美國計畫之本意、從前修正菲島獨立辦法之建議、輒不爲菲島人十所歡迎、但遠東事件現可使其對於保持美旗之利益、發生第二感想、美國或將聽令菲人自決、而造成菲人輿情之主要因素、將爲日本大陸野心之成敗云、數星期前辭去駐菲辦事專員之麥克魯特、近曾在美國佛爾吉尼亞大學演講、主張美國不宜放棄菲島、謂美國如果放棄之、則喪失在東方外交上之發言權、而使美亞兩洲間自堪察加至婆盤洲之島嶼在外人掌握中、成爲美國對華貿易之封鎖綫、許多菲人皆知就精神立塲言、獨立固極動聽、但獨立或成爲主權之轉易、今欲解決此問題厥有一策、即在政治方面美國在菲島保持其國旗與主權、許菲人儘量自治、但仍握外交關稅移民幣制與公債之權、有事時美國應援助維護菲政府之民治基礎、而在經濟方面、美國予菲人以通商之最好機會、而以不妨害美國生產家爲限是已、如美菲成立政治與經濟之永久關係、則爲最善方法、因菲人自願有之、而美國亦非以主權强施諸他人也、美旗懸於菲島、則菲島將爲遠東和平結構之基石、如美旗一旦撤去、則禍亂相尋至少歷一世之久云（八日路透）</p>
<h3>暹反華運動　由日鼓煽　並向緬甸宣傳</h3>
<p>（重慶）暹羅最近之反華運動據此間今日消息、多爲日方宜傳所鼓煽而成、同時日本現在緬甸方面、亦在竭力進行宣傳、以便離間緬甸對華之關係、日方宣傳之方法、卽謂、自滇緬公路完成之後、中國勞動者多已沿公路至緬甸、緬甸方面若不加禁止、則勢將影響緬甸與中國之關係、因中國努動者工資低廉、有影響緬甸工人生活問題之可能也、（八日美聯社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）外傳暹羅國（新近改名泰國）業已加入反共產國際公的、此間暹羅公使館頃堅決予以吾認、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>西南旅行實錄</h3>
<p>鎮南關是軍事的要塞、所以那裏除關城和公署外，沒有市集和村舍，一切日明智品所需，都取給於離關十餘裏的隘口，龍州海關的分卡，就設在此處，外來的旅客，貨物必須在這裏投驗，因此隘口的市面、就漸漸興盛起來、它聚集了商人·司機·和政府辦理運輸的人員、飯店旅館的數量、陸續增加、一到中午、人聲鼎沸、汽車可以從鎮內接到鎮外、綿延一兩裏路、慢慢的一輛挨著一輛受驗、遇到車擠的時候、竟會等上一天半天、所以在實際上、鎮南關並不能算是隘口，才真是難過的一關哩、從馮祥到南寗間、沿途經過明江邑並兩渡口、明江渡至南寗城外、江面較寬、渡舟亦多、可以不致費時、</p>
<p>南寗經過轟炸以後，市面已大不如前、最繁盛的民生路和興寗路各商店、多在下午三時以後開市、貨物大半已經疏散到城外對江、所以德隣路一帶倒相當熱鬧、物價聽說比柳州以上便宜此、各商店多數祇能維持現狀、談不到發展、銀行卻新開了好幾家、如已開幕的中國農民銀行等、所以金融相當活潑、最奇怪的、是在這裏兌越幣、比在安南境內便宜、這是旅客不可不知的、</p>
<p>六·交通中心的柳州</p>
<p>柳州位居廣西中心、陸路有未來湘桂鐵路桂南段和各公路所必經、水道經握柳江中樞、順流而下、可直達梧州、所以在戰事發動以後、便成為西南交通的中心之一、由南寧到此、全程二百六十公裏、車行約八小時、但在賓陽以北、須過遷江的本流和支流兩渡、頗費時間、這一線上的風景很不錯、遷江以北、平地起山、汽車在毫無憑藉的叢山中盤曲而行、真有美不勝收、目不暇接的情況、尤其在大塘以北、六十裏山峯不斷、稱之謂中國的黃石公園、允無媿色、</p>
<p>賓陽是到貴縣和梧州去公路的分又點、大塘是到貴陽去公路的分又點、所以這兩處地方、在邑柳線上占有重要地位、大致從柳州或貴縣到南寧、或從貴縣到柳州的人、多在賓陽午餐、從南寧或宜山到柳州的、則多大大塘午餐、</p>
<p>柳州為柳江所環繞、河北是市區、河南是工業和交通區、各處來的車輛、便集中在河南、過河的工具、以前有浮橋、非常方便、最近被大水沖去、便衹好利用渡船、現有電船渡一艘、每十餘分鐘往來一次、此外還有許多小艙艙船、也是載客的、滿十二人就開、每人五分錢、假如人少要先開、也得給這個數目才行、</p>
<p>過河時的上坡和下坡、腳力稍遜的人、都感到吃不消、所以為乘車便利計、固以住在河南為宜、若想耽擱幾天、則還是住在河北、即以安全而論、河南雖多山洞、但河北至今尚未年到過被炸的痕跡、這也是我主張住在河北的理由之一、</p>
<p>河南一帶、每天晚上到早上開的各種汽車、總有百余輛、過路的客人、數目實在不少、所以旅客和飯店極端發達、不過這種旅店、不大歡迎長客人、旅店多半是因陋就簡、設備根本談不到、茶房的接待、更是馬虎、除了早上一刹那因招呼客人上車而略見緊張外、其餘時間、叫他一聲、都是待理不睬、自顧自打瞌睡或哼小調、所以客人和茶房間、一次衝突幾次是稀鬆平常的事、</p>
<p>河北的市面、祇有三條橫街、交織著四五條直街、其中以正對輪渡碼頭的培新路、和北面的慶雲路最為熱鬧、一橫一直成丁字形、所有書店·銀行·和菜館、都集中在這兩條街上、尤其是慶雲路成為柳州的文化街、商務印書館和其他書店都在這裏、</p>
<p>講到吃的方面、在柳州居然可以嚐到各地的口味、廣東館自不必說、其他如京館·川館·以至山東館·寧波館·都有、不過價錢貴得可以、但因過路客多的關係、家家門庭若市、不過宴會多在晚上、中午時怕有儂襲、商店都半掩著門營業、其餘飯館雖沒有這種情形、但有許多怕客人吃了一半、遇到空襲來不及會帳、便一哄而散、所以要先收錢、最有趣的是茶室、每取一碟點心、付一次錢、頗有外國自動「輪取」機的風味、（未完）</p>
<h3>半年來　日機擾浙統計　投彈二千餘枚</h3>

<h3>蘇魯皖邊華軍　乘青紗帳活動　不老河畔痛殲日軍　津隴兩路鐵軌被毀　日軍傷兵集徐州</h3>
<p>徐州通信、徐州日軍部、以徐州東北之蘇魯邊界、山嶺起伏、青紗帳遍地、為華方海馬擊隊潛伏活動之大本營、日司令官鷲津、一日特派機械兵二百餘名、分乘大卡車六輛、附坦克車一輛、並攜重炮四門、由柳泉賈汪出發、在胡莊渡不老河、企圖向東北山地掃蕩華軍魯蘇皖邊區　　縱隊、韓治隆部據報、先將所部分數路埋伏、待日軍半渡之際、　予合圍夾擊、日軍雖恃其猛烈炮火掩護、戰車汽車橫沖直撞、仍因地形起伏、山石嶙峋、且高梁棵障礙影蔽、其炮火與戰車、均失效能、華軍對該處地勢、尤為熟習、將日軍團團困、激戰一晝夜、日軍不支、乃以火車集中一點、於翌晨突圍逃竄、是役日軍傷亡官兵四十八名、汽車被擊毀二輛、華軍亦傷亡十三員名、獲炮彈十九箱、機槍彈五十二發、皮靴七雙、飯包十二個、</p>
<p>又訊、徐淮海各地華軍遊擊隊、現利用青紗帳掩蔽、大肆活躍、除不時襲日兵營截獲　重外、並將津隴兩路鐵軌、繼續破壞、各縣公路、亦時予以切斷、日軍以防不勝防、近特將津隴兩路沿線各站、酌增防軍、並強抽壯丁、訓練後、配合護路、另迫民眾將鐵路兩側於千二百米達內之高梁、一律割除、但民眾不理、</p>
<p>徐州日軍鷲津師團、近在豫東皖北以及魯南蘇北各地、不時遭遇華軍襲擊、死傷甚重、死亡者多就地焚化、將骨灰北運回國、輕傷者則送各地野戰醫院診治、重傷者、自七月二十日起、送於天津、由徐北上列車附掛四節、每日由徐北運者約一百五十名左右、至所徵之東北籍或其他各地之中國同胞、於作戰負傷時、極輕者予以療治、稍重者即並與死者一同焚斃、故徐州城南之火葬場、輒有中國同胞、因傷焚燒慘號救命之聲、間者莫不酸鼻也、</p>

<h3>江浙淪陷區　幣制大混亂　人民信仰法幣　拒用偽鈔流通</h3>

<h3>外匯緊縮買者觀望　煤業市塲停頓　各貨一律續漲至二三元　日煤競銷市塲無人問津</h3>
<p>煤業市塲因受黑市塲外匯一再緊縮影響、昨日市塲各貨一律飛漲二三元、買者束手、暫停進貨、整個交易停頓、煤塊用途亦吿减色、日煤競銷市上、問津者寥寥、柴炭同業集議劃一售價、惟本市時屆夏令、燃料用途見稀、毫無影響、茲分誌各情於后、</p>

<p>新聲社記者昨向煤業市塲方面探悉、該市塲因受黑市外匯一再緊縮、跌進四便士、致市塲現貨、一律飛漲至每噸二三元不等、秩序紊亂、買者束手、整個市塲交易停頓、提早停市、據該業某領袖吿悉、目前煤業市塲除印度開平煤外、日煤競銷市上、問津者寥寥、售價則較低賤、印度煤存貨尙有三萬多噸、</p>
<p>煤球柴炭　劃一售價</p>

<h3>當局根據報告　籌商抑平米價　浙西米糧銷售組織未臻健全　已由各縣互通有無以維民食</h3>
<p>豆米市塲一〇五家行號、因近日國米來源趨稀、人心忐忑不定、投機米業奸商、乘機活躍、百般設計、圖飽私囊、出沒市塲、私做買賣、致市塲暗盤愈趨猖獗、人頭輾動、坐立不定、咸心虛胆寒、凡此種種、歷所罕有、整個市塲交易停頓、市况淸淡、人聲嘈雜、雖熙攘往返、然皆處談空言、正式交易、咸吿絕跡、</p>
<p>據情報告　市塲實情</p>
<p>公共租界工部局、法租界公董局、遺派探捕、赴米市塲設席、按日監督、並訂定米糧限價、嚴厲執行、一時米價回跌、近因囤戶堅不脫售、致市塲貨樣吿絕、暗盤則吿叢生、秩序愈趨紊亂、當局監督人員、除嚴密注意暗盤交易、獎勵舉發吿密外、現巳將市塲紊亂情形、報吿兩租界當局米糧管理委員會、以便妥籌善策、抑平市况、取締暗盤、聞該會對於市塲情形、頗為關懷、已商妥安定米市、維持全埠民食之大計、</p>
<p>門市零售　處境困苦</p>
<p>米號業同業公會各同業會員、自豆米市塲投機奸商抬高價格後、致市塲現貨稀少、二十元與十六元限價米糧無從購處、關於米號鬥售部皆以决貨照好米限價出售、惟仔貨業將吿罄、若再不取締暗　、勢將無貨應市、昨日市塲各貨繼績上漲至一元或七八角、白粳頭號出二十五元大關、</p>
<p>浙西食糧　支配未善</p>
<p>浙西行署前據各縣報稱慌、日臻嚴重、請求迅予救濟、當經墊款電飭物產運銷處積極設法運濟、茲據復稱、查本處計前後採辦食糧共九千八百十八担四斗、現尙存貯未銷者三千六百八十七扭二斗、惟此項食糧接濟、因各方未能協力合作、故不免發生種種困難、如戰區各縣對於當地銷售食糧之組織、多不健全、甚至毫無組織、以致本處運到供應之米、無人接受、其有組織之縣份、因資本太缺、接收本處食糧、無法照規定付現、以至週轉不靈、又如各縣自行限定當地售價與食糧來源地點之市面不符、以致來米價格超出其當地售價時即無法接受、當地原有之米、反流出價格較高之其他地方、運輸方面、因工具與人力均感缺乏、各縣縣政府之協助、亦極微簿、</p>
<p>訓令各縣　健全組織</p>
<p>各種困難、無法解決其結果形成買成之米無法運出、運出之米、無法銷售、銷售之米、無法收現之現象、行署爰特訓令各縣、嗣後各該縣應即健全常地售米組織、籌定用款、對有運銷處代辦之食糧、運抵該縣時、應即照價付現、籍資週轉、同時對於當地米價、並不得故予抑低、拒絕銷售、尤所不許、至於運輸方面、更應隨時徵雇民伕、積極予以協助、俾便源源運濟、即可供應不缺、蓋內地食米、並無嚴重現象、但苦經營不得其法耳、</p>

<h3>市塲波動甚劇　外匯昨又暴縮　與整個財政機構無影響　政府維持法幣異常穩定</h3>
<p>上海金融市塲因政府權力所不及、奸人作崇、造謠牟利、致市塲波動、但與中國之戰時財政機構、毫無影響、而政府控制之區域、法幣外滙、穩定如恒、必需品之輸入、仍儘量供給外匯、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>法幣外匯　穩定異常</p>
<p>自政府竭力穩定幣制後、非淪陷區域各地、在政府權力直接控制以內、法幣外匯、平靜異常、整個金融、依然穩定、關於必需品之進口、得同外匯審核委員會申請法定外匯、雖須繳納法定匯價、與中交兩行掛牌之匯價差額平衡費、但仍能獲得七辦士之外匯、關於主要土貨之出口、得向結滙銀行領取法定滙價、與中交兩行掛脾之滙價差額平準外滙基金管理委員會、對非淪陷滬域內之外滙、繼績儘量平準、所定各地外滙法定價格、始終不變、</p>
<p>淪陷區域　情形特殊</p>
<p>特殊情形之淪陷區域如上海等、因政府權力一時不及、以致關稅收支、為日截留、日貨以及奢侈品均由淪陷區輸入、投機者作祟、操縱外滙黑市等、租界內資金之逃避、於是淪陷區之上海黑市外滙暴縮、由八辦士許縮至四辦士、實則淪陷區域之法幣滙率之跌落、與中國之戰時財政機構、毫無影響、法幣之眞價値、仍為一先令二辨士半與三十美元、至於上海黑市之外匯、不予維持、聽其自然、以免助長某方之套取外滙、</p>
<p>防止逃避　鼓勵內移</p>
<p>為防止資金向淪陷區之上海逃避、內地鴆力限制匯滬款項、使各地申滙高漲、如重慶等處匯滬之款、滙水漲至一千四百元、並在上海付給滙劃、同時予以限制高額、惟為鼓勳資金內移起見、由上海匯入內地之款、除免收滙費外、上海准付滙劃、內地十足現鈔、並由中中交農四行設立國內滙兌管理委員會辦理之、聞停留於上海之資金、為數頗鉅、各行莊有資金過剩之勢、現各行莊均已考慮如何將過剩資金內移、</p>
<p>法幣信用　始終鞏固</p>
<p>中國之法幣政策、在戰前已見成功、經戰事而其信用益著、法幣現金準備、至今年六月底截止、仍在百分之四十四以上、歷决檢查、均與法定比例相合、政府未嘗乞靈於紙幣政策、法幣信用始終鞏固、迄今在淪陷區域中、仍照舊流通、雖經某方屢圖以其「聯券」「華券」驅逐法幣、但截至目前為止、即在日電勢力所及之地帶、一聯券「華券乏價格、始終在法幣之下、一切支付、仍以法幣為主、人民仍樂於收藏法幣、</p>
<p>金融市塲　波動甚烈</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向金融市塲探悉、關於電傳向倫敦訂印紙幣十萬萬張事件、財政部與中央銀行巳予吾認、而上海金融市塲因投機者之操縱、依然混亂、昨日滙豐掛牌又縮、英滙三辨士七五、美滙七元三一二五、於是黑市正式交易行市、英滙破四辨士關、美滙破八元關、而投機者繼績猛扒、黃金暗市又猛漲、上午收盤四千零五十元、下午收盤四千零八十元、證券統一、甲種跌一元三角、乙丙丁戊各跌九角、滙劃貼水、又漲至二百十元、</p>
<h3>華西墾殖　投資踴躍　墾殖公司招股收款　超過原定數額一倍</h3>

<h3>工部局印發公報事　引起西報抨擊　本年仍歸字林西報印發　各西報聯合提強硬抗議</h3>
<p>大陸報云、關於公共租界工部局近決定　續其現行佈置、將工部局公報於連續第三十一年中、歸字林報印發事、本埠主要報館管理人昨（七日）加批評、而有激烈之反響、彼等之意、一致以爲工部局此種任意決定之行動、旣無法律上道德上之根據、亦乏經濟之理由、</p>
<p>就法律言</p>
<p>因將有關全數納稅人之事、予任何一報以獨佔之優先權、乃與公共租界權限章程相牴牾、就道德言、因其顯示對各國僑民之不公允的歧視、及違反公平行事之道德原理、以言經濟、因係使用納稅人之款項、而使彼等無見工部局之公開招標、俾工部局與</p>
<p>索價最低</p>
<p>者訂立合同之機會、大睦報、上海泰晤士報·英文大美晚報·德文日報·俄文斯洛伏報·與日文大陸新報·近已將措辭强硬之聯合籲請文、呈交工部局、反對長期之歧視待遇、內稱、工部局此舉、至為不公、有作最周密考慮理由、俾恢復公平的公衆行政之原則、又英文大美晚報云、工部局經濟委員會小組會近作報吿、</p>
<p>贊成繼續</p>
<p>由字林報印發工部局公報事、此間外國日報館六家已提出强硬抗議、茲因工部局夏季休假、故尙未正式加以答覆、是項抗議、由上海泰晤士報等六家簽字、係星期六日向工部局總辦費利浦提出、費氏昨（七日）稱、渠已知此項籲請文、俟夏季</p>
<p>休假完畢</p>
<p>將請工部局加以注意、今（八日）晨費氏又稱、工部局於休假期內遇有特殊緊急事件、始能召開會議云、按小組會致工部局之報吿中、促請繼續由字林報印發公報制、謂其所費尙稱公道、若自購機器由華德路監牢中印刷、須費十萬元、</p>

<p>財政部自公佈非常時期禁止進口物品辦法後、將十八組二百三十叫稅則號列進口物品、令飭總稅務司轉飭各關、一體禁止進口、預計上項辦法實施後、按照二十七年度進口額推算、可减省國幣二萬三千餘萬元、合美金六千八百萬元、英金一千三百萬鎊之鉅、惟以戰時所需</p>
<p>國防用品</p>
<p>及工業交通等材料、仍多仰賴輸入、特以渝資字第八六二號部令、頒佈非常時期禁止進口物品領用進口特許證辦法八條、以應實際需要、凡因調劑後方市價、供給特種必要用途、經政府機關核請者、均得依照辦法、呈部核</p>

<p>後、得向該行領取相當於法價與銀行掛脾之滙價差額、所有上項辦法兩種及附表全文、即在工商須知欄內刋載、以期滬商得以週知、</p>

<p>不堪囂擾</p>
<p>且已領得良民證者、在碼頭進出、竟被日軍將證撕去、而遭毆擊受塲、因此釀成風潮、不久保甲處無形瓦解、詎至最近偽南市區公署又舉辦保甲制度、已設登記處於大南門外民立街承德坊六號、由該偽署第二科長朱惠民兼保甲股長、已於上月份起分區挨戶實施保甲戶口登記、其法以數姓數家合住一屋或一姓、</p>

<h3>證劵　統甲所跌獨鉅</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况繼續趨跌、其趨勢與事實之相左、完全為檯面上一般做手所造成、微聞因借貨做空團體、小而不堅、乃不惜顛倒黑白、竭力作利空之宣傳、多方之浮而不實、而又以耳代目者乃亦捲入遊渦、以遂其獲利之目的、大概買進時照檯面一般價為小、團體中互相作假交易市價不小自小、此種病態之市面、投資者固不為所動、投機者則難免墜入骰中、惟市上稍有押款結出、確是事實、昨日經過、開盤即跌、投機家乘機壓迫、丙種四十元忽吿打破、四十九號犬生聯和鴻康等均有賣出、鼎康樂茂震康聯益益中以及三十五號均有買進、波動之最力者獨有丙種為甚、但收盤價比開盤為高、一般做空者大都補進為多、大戶空頭均在觀望、交易頗形熱鬧、市價結果、再小九角至一元三角、成交數的有一百餘萬元、茲列簡明表於後、（外僓及英商遠東股票例假停市）</p>

<p>市上時有多項股票、衆未有顧及、即不隨此漲風而活動者、如里派股、西門布股、及加倫丹股、而陳氏股竟回小至叫角五分、蓋每公司、其內部良佳、暫時未有注意者、此為投資家、專為以款購買股票、久藏之唯一機會、</p>
<p>實業股項、怡和股稍形低落但開平股隨外匯之昂貴、績見上漲、其他各項股票、變動無幾、債券市面趨疲、</p>
<h3>紗花　投機在熱　棉紗再跳二十元</h3>
<p>紗市漲風大熾、新高峰層出不窮、而有再借再勵之勢、投機買風愈盛、大有無紗可購之象、足見局勢緊張之一斑、至於市上流動掮客之呌喊旣在暴而紊亂不堪、那邊討三十元、這邊出四十元有人拖去、此種景象、筆墨不能形容也、總之人心恐慌、達於極點、查其實際情形而論、市面固看好面、然如斯之熱烈、未免超越常軌、一旦反動亦不可不防、二士支特金城價為七百二十元、</p>
<p>現紗晨凱人氣緊昂、因上日滙票改縮、買進者勢如湧泉、開價二十支雙馬棧單價為六百〇八元、少頃買聲大震、市盤上升、接一連二、且一加即五元至十元不等、塲中之經營者、猶如發在、須臾間二十支雙馬外棧貨價由六百三十元開價、直達至六百二十叫五元、收盤後仍續向升、但午後聞英滙稍見放長、半日成交一千六百七十五包、叉上日午後成交五百三十包、行情二十支雙馬漲三十五元、特金城漲二十元、五子醒獅漲二十元、十支粗紗亦漲二十元、申新二廠開出二十支天女四百包、價為五百九十元、現墊棧單、今日有棉紗一百九十五運天津、二十一件運烟台、三十件運廈門、六十件運</p>

<p>另訊滬埠外棉交易、日來因大宗手貨、幾被日廠所吸、故售價日昂、今叉因滙兌之緊縮、同業中藏有存貨者、故竟抬高價格、可紡二十支之原料、竟索價一百五十元有奇、殊不知廠方對於原棉售價之過高、擬用减工致法補救之、此項辦法、聞正在籌劃中、屆時外棉交易、將受打擊矣、</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉布、晨初先印孟買來電報號而漲、空頭抵補、投機者乘機購買、後市價因同業購買及空投繼續抵補而漲、惟大部交易者均抱觀望態度、靜候將於今日公佈之美政府棉產估計報告、收盤時棉價頗稱堅定、較之日前漲五六磅音、按照各同業對於今日公佈之棉產估計、預測為一、五四二、〇〇〇包、昨日印度運同預測漲二羅比、埃及跌十餘磅音、</p>

<p>客秈　昨市突呈混沌氣象、因米店擯守三天後需胃甚貪、而開禁雖經傳說、尙待貨到方能證實、月在粳尖米抬漲之際、高京秈乃扳價至廿一元半、高蕪秈亦須廿一元以上、在十六元限內者祇少數宿决　米與糙米而已、明暗盤開出一千五六百包、暗盤行情較漲六七角至近元不等、</p>

<h3>小麥布昂　下脚粉北帮動銷</h3>

<p>麥市漲風不已、因近來產價步昂、到貨减少縮、而廠家需要甚殷、囤戶叉在放價吸收、行販莫不居奇、半由於米市與物價飛漲所激起、統市售開京鎭常丹及浦東等麥續有三十車之多、計由福新阜豐兩廠辦去十三車、其餘悉由本街行囤辦去、最高價已達八元一角五分、較前日又升二三角云、</p>

<h3>移打醮費救濟難民</h3>
<p>— （新夢）</p>
<p>而今的上海，什麼東西都要趕起早市來，去中秋還有兩月，可是月餅早巳在市塲上發現。不但是吃的，連打醮也趕起早市來，廢曆的七月還沒有展開，都市裹却巳有人在發起打蘸了。</p>
<p>上海的打醮是以里弄為單位的，每一條弄堂或每一條街市，有人發起打一决太平公醮，也許更有闊綽的人家，獨個子打一决醮。除了請和尙或道士唸經之外，還要買錫箔，紙人，紙物，和其他一切，打一天醮，至少也要費幾十元錢，甚至百元開外，幾百元的也有，這要看規模的大小而定。整個上海，有多少里弄，為了打醮，一筆消費也够驚人的</p>
<p>七月在中國人的習俗上，是一個鬼的季節，正和淸明一樣，為了鬼，不知耍耗去多少錢。為了打醮，和尙道士走上一部鴻運，忙得來不及應酬，每一個寺院或下院之類，在七月裹不知要賺多少錢，同時，紙紮店裹，也每一家正忙着糊製紙神，紙鬼一類打醮的東西，據說不拘那一家紙紮店，七月裏所做的生意，比其他一年中十一個月所合併的還多。所以在道班人，一年展開之後，所望的也就是七月這一個打醮的月季。</p>
<p>大概所謂公醮之類，每是由看弄堂的，白相人之類的發起。就一條或聯合若干條里弄，挨戶捐錢，除非信敎之外，一般的人家，對於幾角錢乃至一二元的打醮捐款，是會每年很慷慨的拿出來，毫不吝惜的，事後雖然有一篇報銷賬寫在黃紙頭上，貼在大家可以看到的地方，但發起人，這裏面也正有好多油水揩到。這班人發起打醮，目的是什麼，除非笨伯是任何人都知道的</p>
<p>打醮旣然是迷信，何况在生活程度高到天際的當兒，這筆鉅大的消費，似乎可以免去的。節約的呼聲已鬧到震天價響，如果不能把這筆打醮費節下來，那其他的消費就不必論了。因此，在這打蘸季快將展開之時，新新公司的經理金宗城君有移打醮費救濟難民之倡，而接着本市節的救難委員會也籲請各界莫再打醮，把打醮所費，移作救濟難民只用。</p>
<p>的確，如果把全上海人爲了打醮所費，移作救濟難民之用，那可救活不少難民，比徒為鬼神而耗費耍切實得多。所以筆者竭誠的希望都市住民，把打醮的錢救難民，旣革除舊俗，難民又可獲得救濟，眞是何樂而不爲呢！</p>
<h3>雨過天靑</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十四回　烟火千家鄉村合作　波禱萬里瀛海飛行</p>
<p>再有一件事：就是請父親在股東裹面，請定一位總經理。蛇無頭而不行，有了一位總經理，一切便可以遵命而行了。這幾件事，她們都是從自由村回到安樂鎭後，商量定妥後，寫信給她們父親的。可憐她們兩姊妹，每天在章醫師家裹，商量到半夜。原來章醫師家裹，起來的人，都是很早，而晚上睡覺，也是很早。到了夜裹十點鍊的時候，差不多全屋子的人都熄燈安睡了。但楚朱愛人和她們說：「我們是因為明朝一早要起來，到醫院中去，所以不能不早睡。你們却不必明天一天亮就起身的，你們不必受這個拘束。你們要商量什麼事，起草什麼計書害，儘管隨隨便便。而且夜裹比較靜心點，寫什麼東西之類，是夜裹最相宜。你們是知道我的，我最喜歡夜裹寫東西。現在却是没有法子但你們不要因為我們早睡，池拘束起來。你們儘管一夜天不咽，也沒有關係。」可是愛人雖然如此說，她們却是恐怕驚動了別人，連說話都是喊嘁哫哫的不敢響說。愛人却是知道的，特為給她們備了些乾點心，或是頂好的餅乾。再不然，呌廚房裹給她們熬好了鶏　粥，知道她們廣東人喜歡吃消夜點心的。不過她自己却睡自己的覺，恕不奉陪了。誰知到了星期三，何家兩位小姐接到她們父親從北平發了一封電報。那電報中說道：「父奉國際貿易會令，不日即有新疆之行。望轉電母弟。織綢廠事，股東中欲令兩兒負全責，擬延雙兒為經理，便兒為工程師。開辦前，儷可飛歐美考察，期以一月。建築廠屋等事，亦請汝輩全相辦。江鏡丈回南，星期一司至滬，住國際飯店。渠亦股東之一，且會辦絲織物廠有經騐者，汝輩可往謁之，款亦由彼匯交也。」何家兩位小姐得着了他們父親這樣一個電報，自然一切都滿意。可是一切都要忙起來了，允其是仍舊要敎雙玉當經理。雙玉說：「這件事，幹不了，我們是個初出茅廬的人，一點沒有經騐，如何可以當經理呢？」儷玉要慰她道：你別着急！反正江家伯伯要到上海來了，他是當過某某織綢公司經理的，我們請求他担任便了。」正是：</p>
<p>正擬遠征同去無，忽聞傳信有歸鴻（一六八）</p>
<h3>不要買逾限價的米</h3>
<p>— 南</p>
<p>上海的物價，最近呈了飛躍的狀態，一樣的生活至少漲了一倍，使得一般薪給階級，困難萬分，天天計算着這裹省那裏省，還是感到入不敷出。</p>
<p>最近租界當局限制米價每担最高不得過二十元，並為了切實維持這限價，會採用了嚴厲的手段，這條規定是為了大衆的福利，我們當更應努力幫助推行，可是最近巳發現了越規的現象。</p>
<p>昨天，朋友家裹買進一担米，價格是二十元四角，而發票上則開着二十元。我覺得很寄怪，問朋友為什麼明吃虧呢？他的夫人說：這樣斤量可以足些，米的成色也可以好些。後來問了幾家人家，大都有着同樣的情形。</p>
<p>這種暗盤的交易，在買者或以為沒有吃虧，或還可便宜些，但他的影響則是很大的。因為這種暗盤存在着，一定慢慢地漲高，最後必致現在的限價無法維持，使大家都受到損害。我們應該一致堅決地拒絕購買逾限價的米，不要為了一己佔些小便宜，而給商人們造了牟利的機會；並且假如有提高米價的商店，就立刻予以吿發，使他受到公衆的制裁。</p>
<p>同時更希望租界上的米商們，不要為了少許的利潤，做着沒良心，對不起同胞，對不起國家的事。</p>
<h3>關於四十萬元郵票</h3>
<p>（一）希望照舊鈔票例儘量收回</p>
<p>讀了「四十萬元的郵票」以後，覺得這問題確有討論的必要。據筆者今天向幾家烟兌店談話的結果，現在掛牌的行情竟由一元兌一百十分，一百二十分，而拋高到一百三十分，一百四十分了。不過，這競賣是有着更大的苦衷在內。掛牌一百十分和一百二十分的，當然是收進的郵票太多，不惜犧牲，吸收法幣。掛牌一百三十分和一百四十分的，其犧牲之大，幾達三分之一强，烟兌店的利潤果然優厚，但也不會再高過三分利的，這樣犧牲之下，他們營業上將受極大的損失是必然的。然而畢竟忍痛犧牲了。自從郵票代替分幣通行以來，因為輾轉相傳，污損，脫膠，在所不免，而郵政局正在這時候發表禁用污損郵票，及寄外埠與掛號信件不得貼用零碎郵票的通吿，現在分幣券又即將運滬，這些污損的郵票放在手裹，自然將不値半文錢，所以，與其將來受到全軍覆沒的更大損失，還不如及早脫手。每元兌換一百三十分及一百四十分的，就都是這些污損的一分郵票。</p>
<p>四十萬元—這龐大的數目，在分幣券發行以後，如何處置呢？</p>
<p>郵局是國家機關，第一，我們自然要求按照舊鈔票例，儘量收回，如果事實確是不可能，那末，希望接受第二個要求：</p>
<p>「禁用污損郵票」及「寄外埠及掛號信件不得貼用零碎郵票」這兩個通吿，能暫緩實行，或者有一個適可的限期。</p>
<p>這是我們最低的期望，當局能有更週詳的辦法，自然更好。</p>
<p>— （素臣）</p>
<p>（二）希望各團體機關貢獻辦法</p>
<p>讀了新夢先生的「四十萬元的郵票」後，我認為這問題異常迫切地需耍有一個妥善的辦法，使這事能獲得合理的解決，那末不但一般小販商人受惠匪淺，同時可消除社會上許多為了郵票引起的糾紛。</p>
<p>我首先提議要求上海郵政當局，在中央分幣券發行之後，應即將本市流通的郵票，不論損污或破舊，限期收回，致於手續及辦法當另行詳細擬定</p>
<p>更希望在中央分幣券尙未到滬之前，郵政當局應該先發佈吿，以安人心，免得在靑黃不接的時候，弄得市面混亂不堪，事關全市五百萬市民切身利害，萬望賢明郵政當局，深切注意。</p>
<p>以上二點，或許也是上海市民一致要求，我希望社會各界熱心有力人士，以及市商會納稅華人會等團體機關，請儘量提出高見，貢獻辦法，立刻與郵政當局進行接洽，使這嚴重問題早日圓滿解決，則造福平民，深非淺鮮。</p>

<h3>靈魂到底有無？（續）</h3>
<p>— 竺</p>
<p>（1）看不見的是有的！你若說，看不見的是無德，那末空氣和電除了少數專門家以外，我們普通人都沒有看見過但我們看牠們的動作知道空氣和電都是有的！從前有一無神黨的一聲說，我割了許多症，在人身上從沒有看見過靈魂。那時有一基督信徒問那他說，某醫生，你愛你的夫人麽？醫生說，那當然愛德。基督徒說，請你把你的愛給我看看，那醫生九目瞪口呆了。各位，你旣知道，愛雖未見，確是有的，感情也是有的，靈魂也是這樣，雖不能看見，確是有的。（二）人之形體與鳥獸不同！鳥獸形體都是背向日月，頭朝地上，除了尋找地上食物之外，別無希望，因牠們沒有靈魂，死了完結。但我們人類與鳥獸大不相同，所以人之形體乃是頭頂日月，面朝天上，不是單求地上食物以爲足；還要爲靈魂尋求天上永久之福！地上的物質決不能滿足你我心靈的。可惜近世有好多人，被唯物主義迷惑，以爲世上肉體享樂為滿足！不再追味靈性上水久之安慰，希望，平安，喜樂，水生，屬天之福。這樣的人自命爲得意，其實良知損傷，是可憐的人人，與烏獸相差幾何呢？盼望親愛的謮者，不要蹈他們覆轍，總要爲靈魂找一條出路爲要。</p>

<h3>一年一度　七月七夕　一片天河配聲</h3>
<p>— 燕雁</p>
<p>天上人間　牛郎織女</p>
<p>（北平劇訉）每逢良辰佳節，平劇界例有應節戲之演出，七月七夕之「天河配」，即其中之一也。本年七夕節即將到臨，平地各戲院皆將公演是戲，以資點綴。預料今年之「天河配」，當較往幾為盛，　就所聞，報道如次：</p>

<h3>惠斯穆勒重返銀幕</h3>
<p>— 鳳翔</p>
<p>米高梅公司邀訂七年合同　中國泰山屆時將一爭千秋</p>
<p>關於「人猿泰山」的故事，早就膾炙人口，但「泰山」在銀幕上的出現，則還是一九一八年的事。第一次擔任這個重任的是埃而莫·林肯（Elmo　Lincoln），其俊會歷次重拍，飾演該角的差不多更換過十二人，然而能使觀眾看了留下深刻的印象的，不過四人而已。這四位的大名是：約翰·惠斯穆勒（Johnny　Weissmuller），勃司透·克拉白（Buster　Orabe），漢門白列克司（Herman　Brix）和加侖馬立斯（Glenn　Morris）而其中尤推出推會於世界運動會榮獲游泳冠軍的惠斯穆勒為最著名。</p>
<p>惠斯穆勒氏以前在好萊塢的米商梅影片公司拍過好多部關於「人猿泰山」的片子，如一九三二年的「人猿泰山」，一九三四年的「泰山情侶」和一九三六年的「泰山出險」。最近，米高梅公司又和他訂了一個新的七年長期合同，並定一待他在本年十月三十一日世界博覽會裏的游泳節目完畢，立即返好萊塢，拍攝新片「泰山被逐」（Tarzan　in　Exile），消息傳來，影迷們諒必欣喜萬分吧。</p>
<p>再者，前傳香港的我國大力士彭飛，有拍攝「中國泰山」的訊息，會一度來滬邀請女星李紅合演，惟因李紅有合同關係，分身乏術，衹得作罷，另外請到了黎灼來擔任這個要角，屆時倒可一看「中國泰山」和「外國泰山」在銀幕上各爭和千秋哩。</p>
<h3>莫里哀與「理想夫人」</h3>
<p>— 哲</p>
<p>最近半年來，莫里哀的戲劇在上海很盛行：三月中旬，中法劇藝學校有「裝腔作勢」的演出，不久以前，又有滬江文學會與新演劇社「偽君子」的演出。從這點看來，莫裏哀的喜劇，正為一般觀眾所歡迎。他們所以歡喜莫裏哀的作品，正因為莫氏喜劇是社會現實的表現，和積極性的暴露。</p>
<p>莫裏哀是法國十七世紀的大喜劇家，他在法國戲劇上的地位，恰如莎士比亞之在英國。莫裏哀的作品，是有著高度的超時間性的，裏面充滿著活力，能在世界任何一個角落裏，擁用無數量的觀眾。莫氏是用嚴肅的態度來製作他的喜劇，他所表現的，都是他時代中的社會的弱點，人類的買點。他從週圍生活中選取一般的典型來作他的喜劇中的人物。莫裏哀喜劇的引人發笑，不是單純的情感的，而是客觀地理智地感到好笑。</p>
<p>「理想夫人」是莫氏一六六二年的作品，原名「夫人學堂」（L'Ecole　des　Femmes）。現經孫樟先生改編為三幕中國劇。內容大概這樣：有位安納福先生，是一個鍍過金的人，也是一個在愛情的漩渦內栽過無數筋鬥的人。歐美的結婚離婚，以及祇重愛情不重貞操的那種結合，使得他自已不敢輕於嘗試；加以自己在戀愛場中老打敗仗，更不免提起了結婚就要膽戰心寒。</p>
<p>可是他是四十多歲的人了，在飽暖之餘，終又想起了結婚的那件事來。於是由於要想結婚而又不滿於現實的女子，於是不能不另轉念頭，創造出一個所謂「理想」的「夫人」出來，以達到他超現實的「理想」。果然根據他的愚妄理論，從無錫的一個窮鄉婦手裏覓來一位天真未　的姑娘，將她寄養在小尼姑菴裏，施行奴化教育。</p>
<p>結果等他到無錫去了十天回來，情形變了，姑娘與他的朋友　振青的兒子打得火熱，後來其中又發現了許多意料之外的關係，終於天緣巧合，結為美滿的婚姻。而安納先生呢，既然看不起女人，不放心女人，怕女人，好了，那衹吸讓他鰥以終身了。</p>
<p>一六六二年，莫裏哀表演「妻子學校」時，因觀眾不能欣賞劇中的好處，受到許多胡亂的批評，尤其是一般貴族婦女，覺得裏面的故事是故意侮辱他們。莫裏哀聽見了他們的惡評，也自氣憤不過，於是另編了一部「妻子學校的批評」於一六六三年開演，卻意外地受到社會的歡迎。可是當時有一位費雅持公爵，以為劇中某個人物指的是他，因此大為震怒，設法報復。終於有一天莫裏哀受到一個莫大的侮辱，滿臉給費公爵以銅鈕擦出血來。這雖是莫裏哀演劇史裏的一段趣聞，但也可顯出當時莫氏的不容於社會，和不屈不撓的暴露精神。</p>
<p>（編者按：中法劇社繼「原野」後上演的，就是「理想夫人」，由舒湮導演，戲已經排練熟了，可是據昨天得到的消息，或許要更動，改演什麼戲，則不知道，容後再報告罷。）</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>趂着天一明时，夥計引導著角兒同到預先約定的所在，會合了勾角的人等，上了轎車，放下門簾，趕車的緊加上一鞭，不到半個時辰，已經走下了幾十裏路，及至天已大明，園主方面再發現這事，已是無法追蹤了。這般人既經到達目的地之事，勾角人固然要得到殊賞，同時全城人一聽說某角係某園勾來的角色，那簡直都認為驚奇之事，一旦登臺演唱，必定可以哄動一氣，眾人的心理，總覺得該角的技藝一定比自投搭班的角兒要勝強百倍呢。似此仿佛已成了一種習慣，即令後來再有某伶係自投而來的，園主方面也要揚言出去，說是某角是從某處勾來，如此習以為常，所以從前內地各戲館對於「勾角」這個名詞，是非常普遍的流行語呢。時至今日交通既便，名角又無不自備行頭，秘密勾角，一變而為公開的邀角，事先登報宣傳，定議後專人往接，啟行之日，搬運戲箱數十百年，復佐以配角若幹名，隨從十餘員，浩浩蕩蕩儼若軍旅之出發，聲勢煊赫，唯恐知者不眾，以較　昔時代，名角背荷小包裏，賞夜穩匿騾車內，與勾角人私奔之情形，實有　壞之別。今昔變遷之不同，固足使人驚異，然而伶人苦樂之懸殊，亦相差甚钜，尚希今日之　角名伶，幸勿過事驕縱，庶幾前輩伶工，方不致忿恨不平也。</p>

<h3>Donghua Army in Shanxi Recovers Lin County; Japanese Troops Near Sui County Attacked by Chinese Forces from North and South; Highlands Near Yangzi Occupied by Chinese Army; Successful Counterattack by Guangdong Army Recovers Xinjie Station</h3>
<p>The war situation in eastern Shanxi is progressing smoothly for the Chinese side daily. The Japanese army had previously concentrated its forces, based in Changzhi and Lucheng, attempting to join forces with the Japanese troops in She County to attack Licheng. Their aim was to open up their east-west trunk line from Linfen to Dongyangguan. However, due to a preemptive strike by the Chinese army, which attacked Huguan, captured Changzhi, and forced the Japanese troops stationed in Tunliu to move west, the Japanese army felt at a loss. Furthermore, continuous rain and rising river waters forced the Japanese troops in She County to retreat due to high water levels, making their previous plans a complete failure. Under favorable weather conditions, a certain unit of the Chinese army launched a surprise attack on the Japanese troops in Hengshui (east of Lin County) on the 2nd. A plainclothes team of a certain unit even encircled and attacked the Japanese flanks. After fierce fighting until noon, the Japanese troops suffered heavy casualties and were unable to hold out, retreating towards Shuiye (west of Anyang). The Japanese army's supply lines to Lin County were cut off by the Chinese army. A certain unit of the Chinese army then took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese troops in Lin County. After a day and night of intense fighting, the Japanese troops, feeling isolated, concentrated all their forces to launch a fierce assault on a certain unit of the Chinese army north of them. The Chinese army, in order to lure the Japanese troops away from the Lin County town, feigned weakness and gradually retreated north. The Japanese troops, unaware of the ruse, pressed on relentlessly. Once the objective of luring the enemy away from the mountain was achieved, a local team of the Chinese army took advantage of the situation and recaptured Lin County in one fell swoop. Having lost their base, the Japanese troops took advantage of the pre-dawn darkness to flee northeast. The Chinese army is now consoling the civilians while pursuing the Japanese troops. The recovery of Lin County provides an additional layer of protection for the Chinese side's superior outer defenses of the Taihang Mountains. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The war situation in western Shanxi has been dormant for a long time. Recently, in order to support the war situation in eastern Shanxi, the Japanese troops in Lishi set out on the 4th in four routes to invade westward, attempting to spy on Liulin Jun Ferry. One group set out from Xiyadi Zaolin Village, one group set out from Mamaozhuang, one group set out from Qiaojiacheng Liangjiahui, and one group set out from Lijiawan Wangjiahui. However, each group had only a small number of troops, only a little over a hundred people. The Chinese army xx unit intercepted them on different routes. On the morning of the 5th, they also began mobile strategies and attacked the Japanese. The x unit stormed into Xishu Mountain (north of Lishi) in one fell swoop, killing many Japanese soldiers. The x unit also attacked Daheng Mountain (west of Lishi) with agility. Despite the fierce resistance from the Japanese army, the brave Chinese soldiers risked their lives in hand-to-hand combat, engaging in bayonet fighting. After a fierce battle, they finally completely occupied Daheng Mountain. The remaining Japanese troops are retreating westward. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) There have also been small-scale engagements in southern Shanxi recently. At dawn on the 2nd, over 400 Japanese troops attacked from Nantian Gan Luanshi Peak (southeast of Jincheng), but were met with a head-on blow from a certain unit of the Chinese army. After a day of fierce fighting, the Japanese troops were unable to hold out and fled towards the Daokou Tianjingguan area (southeast of Jincheng). On the night of the 2nd, over 200 Japanese troops in Boai again harassed the areas of Daxiaohuangling (north of Boai). A certain unit of the Chinese army ambushed them midway, and the Japanese troops also fled in disarray towards Xuliang (west of Boai). (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a statement by the Chinese military spokesman, after the Japanese army's failed offensive at Mingguang Xinyang on the Pinghan Railway, they have shifted their main force to attack the Henan-Hubei border. The Japanese 3rd Division is currently invading Sui County, a Chinese military base. The Chinese army is paying close attention to the battle in this area. (8th Huitong News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng. The Chinese westward advancing troops between Liulin and Wushengguan recently attacked the Japanese army near the railway line at Jiuligang, Sanlicheng, and Daxindian, killing many. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng. In the northern Hubei war situation, the Chinese army has shifted from a passive to an active position. The Japanese troops attacking Lishan and Gaocheng were forced to retreat south by the pressure from the Chinese xx unit. At the same time, the Chinese army in Dahong Mountain also launched an attack on Sui County. The Japanese troops, suffering from attacks from both north and south, were met by fresh Chinese forces on the Lishan line. They collapsed and retreated to the Shanshuigou Jiangjiahe area, constructing fortifications to defend. In addition, over a thousand Japanese troops are actively operating in the Junchuandian Anjudian Luoyangdian area. The Chinese Dahong Mountain garrison is closely monitoring them. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo. After two months of silence, six Japanese warships and over twenty motorboats sailed into the lake area of the Xiangbei Lujiaoshi on the morning of the 8th, firing over a hundred shells at the shore, creating a probing disturbance. The Chinese lake defense forces also returned fire to suppress them, and the two sides engaged in artillery fire. By 2 p.m., the shelling had ceased, and the Japanese warships and boats had escaped. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing. On the 4th, the Japanese troops in Jiangmen forcibly seized 70-80 civilian boats, carrying hundreds of soldiers to the Rongqi River in Shunde. On the 5th, the Japanese troops in Guizhou continuously fired artillery shells, frantically bombarding the Chinese positions, attempting to cover the Japanese troops' advance north. The Chinese military and civilians along the river are calmly preparing to meet the attack. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Foreign news reports that after the Japanese army's invasion of Zhongshan was repelled, they shifted their focus and concentrated their forces in Yangjiang, east of Guangzhou Bay, and Fangcheng, west of Beihai, causing tension in both areas. There are currently eleven Japanese warships and twenty steamships near the coast of Yangjiang. It is said that this concentration will be larger than the Zhongshan campaign. In addition, 4,000 Japanese troops were sent to reinforce northern Guangdong. The Chinese army took advantage of their absence to launch a counterattack, directly attacking Xinjie Station. The Chinese air force also shot down a Japanese plane at Lotus Mountain. Due to the Chinese army's counterattack, there have been battles on all fronts in Jiangmen, Foshan, Xinhui, and Xin'an. (8th special dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng. The Japanese troops in Yangzi, southwest of Dahong Mountain, previously launched a vigorous attack north in coordination with the Japanese troops in Sui County. They were met by the Chinese troops who crossed the river to fight back. Now they are retreating to defend Yangzi. The Chinese army has occupied the highlands over ten miles north of Yangzi, surrounding and attacking them. In the afternoon of the 7th, over two hundred Japanese troops came to reinforce them, but were ambushed by the Chinese forces at Daxiao Chenchong, killing over thirty Japanese soldiers. The Japanese still retreated back to Huangjiaji. (8th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) After the Japanese army captured Lishan on the 5th, they continued to increase their strength with over twenty tanks and over a thousand infantry, advancing from Jingmingpu (northwest of Lishan) towards Tangxianzhen (northwest of Jingmingpu), attempting to attack Zaoyang. The Chinese xx unit is currently intercepting them east of the xx line. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuhuang. The Chaoan Chinese teams are extremely active, frequently carrying out sabotage of Japanese fortifications. Huang Liu, the chief of the Chaozhou-Shantou puppet police局, was killed by a Chinese team in Anbu on the 5th. In order to prevent Chinese guerrillas from lurking, the Japanese army conducted inspections, and closely monitored the Chinese traitors and puppet police they employed. Those who were even slightly suspicious were immediately killed. There is a shortage of food in Chaozhou City. The Japanese army forced the residents to donate, and the poor residents, unable to bear the oppression, fled in droves. (7th dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanyang. The war situation in southern Henan is becoming increasingly favorable. The Chinese army is continuing to press on towards Changtaiguan. Another unit of the Japanese army launched an attack on the Chinese army, encountering them southwest of Sanguanmiao. Fierce fighting is still ongoing. The Japanese troops west of Xinyang are using Shunhedian as a base. There are no Japanese traces west of Xiaolindian. In the northern Hubei area, over 3,000 Japanese troops from Gaocheng and Liujiahe are advancing westward. Japanese cavalry were discovered in Shangshidian, thirty miles north of Lishan. The Japanese troops who harassed Lishan are now advancing towards Tangxianzhen. The Japanese troops east of Huantan are invading westward. The Chinese army has separately taken control and is blocking them. (7th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Siam and Today's International Situation</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Hong Kong telegram stated: "It is suddenly rumored here that Siam is about to join the German-Italian-Japanese Anti-Comintern Pact, which has greatly shocked the people, because if Siam does join the alliance, the position of Britain and France in the Far East will inevitably be greatly weakened; however, according to a Bangkok telegram obtained privately here, the Siamese government has already come forward to deny the rumors of joining the Anti-Comintern Pact, and has dismissed them as groundless." This is a private telegram. Last night, another telegram from London stated: "It is rumored that Siam has already joined the Anti-Comintern International Public. The Siamese Embassy in England has firmly denied this." This is credible. In this time of international crises and dangers, Siam's actions are often overlooked by the world. However, Siam's position cannot be overlooked, and if an international war breaks out, the relationship will be very important. Siam has a vast territory of 530,000 square kilometers, which is larger than China's Xikang Province; its population is 12.5 million, which is slightly less than China's Guangxi Province, and overseas Chinese account for 2.5 million, accounting for one-fifth of the total; it is not a large country. The religion is Buddhism, and the monks are the most influential. Eight out of ten civilians are farmers, the cultural level is not high, the political situation has only been stable for three or five years, the finances are not prosperous, and the military strength is insufficient. It is also not a strong country. It is located in the southwest of China, vertically south of Kunming, Yunnan, which is its capital, Bangkok; it borders French Indochina to the northeast, British Burma to the northwest, the Gulf of Siam to the east, the Bay of Bengal to the west, and the British Malaya Federation to the south, which is the mother body of Singapore naval base, the British Far East naval base; therefore, the country is not big or strong, but it is actually located among the powerful. So why should it not be overlooked in the turbulent world? Independent countries have their lives, their strength, and their consciousness; and the only independent countries in the Far East are China, Japan, and Siam. Siam is not strong enough to influence the overall situation in the Far East on its own, but its partiality can have a significant impact. If Siam is on good terms with Britain and France, then Britain and France have no demands on Siam; if Siam forms a strong ally and is hostile to Britain and France, it will become a threat to Britain and France's Far East forces; although the Singapore naval base is strong, it can rely on Siam to strike the back of Singapore; if the "Kra" canal is dug through Siam's waist to connect the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean, not only will Singapore no longer be the key to the east and west, but the treasure trove of India can also be coveted. Can it be said that it can be overlooked? The Japanese have been wooing Siam for a long time with smiles, courtesy, sons and daughters, jade and silk, and Amitabha Buddha, without being meticulous. The rumor that Siam has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact has also been frequently spread in recent months, and there are clues for a reason; therefore, yesterday's statement that it has already joined should not be regarded as abrupt; and it is also transmitted at the same time as the vigorous suppression of overseas Chinese, the closure of schools, and the search of banks; the Hong Kong telegram said that the people were greatly shocked by this, which is appropriate. Fortunately, it has now been proven that the rumors are not accurate, and Chamberlain is probably already full of false alarms!</p>
<p>However, there are things that must be discussed: the untrustworthiness of the statement that Siam has already joined the Anti-Comintern Pact does not need London and Hong Kong's public and private telegrams to prove it; the time has not yet come, and the situation does not allow it. Why? Although Siam is an independent country and should have freedom of consciousness, it is difficult to choose between several strong countries and cannot freely express its consciousness; at this time of international chaos, with friends and enemies all over the place, and everything is about to be divided, even if Siam's anti-communist consciousness is full of both the government and the public, how can it first choose its friends and enemies, determine its fate, and eagerly join the Anti-Comintern Pact? It has not been heard that Britain and France have any plans to annex Siam; and when Britain's Singapore naval base is about to be completed, it intends to lend Siam huge sums of money to help it strengthen its military preparations, and the friendship is not bad. Moreover, at this time, Japan has no extra time to manage Siam, no extra power to guarantee Siam, and it is not the time to rely on Siam to divide Britain and France. If Siam rashly joins the aggressive group, so that Annan, Burma, and Malaya will be directly threatened in the future, and India, where resources are located, and Singapore, a military stronghold, will be indirectly shaken, then Britain and France will definitely not raise a boil and will definitely take the lead in getting the upper hand. It can be asserted; and at this time, this situation is as easy as taking something out of a bag; this is well known to Siam, and it will definitely not want to bring disaster upon itself. Thus, it can be known that the statement that it has already joined is unbelievable.</p>
<p>To say that Siam will never join the Anti-Comintern International Public, and London and Hong Kong can be free from concern about Siam; this is not the case, and it must not be the case. The key lies not in how Siam's consciousness will freely choose to obey; but in how Siam's international environment will evolve. If an international war breaks out, then Siam's impartiality can affect a part of the military. Those who lose Siam will be burdened by Siam, so it is said that Siam cannot be overlooked, but this is not what is said today. As it stands now, the war has not yet broken out, then although Siam is jealous of overseas Chinese and abuses overseas Chinese, Siam's attitude towards Britain and Japan, whether as friends or enemies, will depend on the victory or defeat of China's war of resistance; in other words, Siam has newly named its country "Thailand"; "Thailand" means freedom. However, whether it can maintain its status as Thailand while mediating between the British and French forces, or whether it will inevitably suffer the sharp edge of aggression and be reduced to a vassal, merely becoming a ladder for aggressors to advance south, will only depend on the victory or defeat of China's war of resistance. If China's war of resistance is not victorious, "the position of Britain and France in the Far East will inevitably be greatly weakened." Under coercion, Siam will be unable to avoid joining the Anti-Comintern International Public even if it is unwilling, and Britain and France will be unable to oppose its joining. Hong Kong and Annan will no longer belong to Britain and France, which goes without saying. Even Burma and India will not be able to obtain Siam as a buffer or shield. For China must win. Only then will the Far East be stable, the international community have order, and there will be rules to be followed together: and Siam must also maintain its glorious history and be an independent Thailand, so today's London and Hong Kong do not need to worry or rejoice about Siam's joining the Anti-Comintern International Public, but must pay attention to the victory or defeat of the Sino-Japanese War!</p>
<h3>Assault Incident: British Consulate in Tianjin Lodges Serious Protest with Japan; Demands Cessation of Anti-British Movement; Japanese Side Has Not Yet Responded; Admits Mobs Passed Through Japanese Sentry Lines</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Regarding the incident last Friday in which mobs attacked the British Swire branch and the British International Trading Company in the former Russian concession, the British Consul Jameson lodged a serious protest with the Japanese Consul Tadashiro this morning, and requested the Japanese military authorities to stop the anti-British movement in the Japanese-controlled area, and requested that Japanese soldiers be stationed in front of British-owned shops in the Japanese-controlled area for defense. However, as of the time of the telegram, the Japanese Consul had not yet responded. According to those close to the Japanese Consul, the Japanese side will definitely reject the British protest, using the excuse that the Chinese people's anti-British sentiment is a natural expression, or will even state that if the British can support Japan's establishment of a new order in East Asia, then this kind of anti-British movement will naturally be eliminated as a response. According to the Japanese military spokesman, the demonstrators on that day did safely pass through the Japanese sentry lines. These people did not carry passes. The reason why the Japanese sentries let them pass is because these people did not have any suspicious points. (8th Associated Press telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, the local newspapers published a list of British goods prohibited from public purchase, with a list of Chinese, Japanese, and German goods that can be used as substitutes, and also carried news of a riot caused by a mass meeting in Zuoshan, Jiaoji Railway. It is said that the masses invaded the property of the Asiatic Petroleum Company and seized a large amount of gasoline and kerosene. According to missionary sources, a new anti-American incident occurred in Huoxian, one hundred miles southeast of Taiyuan. An American belonging to the China Inland Mission in the area has been expelled from the city. The missionary is now avoiding other missionaries in Jiexiu, fifty miles away.

<h3>Anti-American Slogans Discovered in North China; Japanese Side Denies Involvement</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Several British missionaries arrived here yesterday from Shijiazhuang. They claimed that they had seen anti-American slogans in Shijiazhuang. The Anti-Foreign Movement Committee there had plastered "Overthrow America" slogans all over Shijiazhuang. However, the Japanese Embassy here denied the movement, saying, "Our country's (Japan's) main policy is to maintain good relations with the United States." The Embassy spokesman also claimed that the so-called anti-American movement was a "fabricated message" and was "a British plan to drag the United States into the Far Eastern dispute." He also said that the Embassy had made a long-distance call to inquire with the Japanese troops stationed in Shijiazhuang and Kaifeng. According to the reply from the troops stationed there, no anti-American movement had been discovered locally. The spokesman continued, "There is no reason for anti-American demonstrations now or in the future." Foreigners here are paying attention to the situation in Kaifeng. The British missionaries who evacuated from there have reportedly handed over their property to American citizens for safekeeping. Yesterday, the Japanese military newspaper "Yong Bao" reported that the Kaifeng Anti-British Committee had decided to take over the property of the British churches, "in order to ensure that it would not be burned down by anti-British elements." Foreigners here predict that if the Anti-British Movement Committee expels the American citizens who are guarding the British missionary property, a conflict is quite possible. "Yong Bao" also stated that the Japanese troops stationed in Jinan had dispersed rioters who attacked the Asiatic Petroleum Company on August 1. The Japanese troops had seized six tins of gasoline stolen from the Asiatic Petroleum Company from the rioters and returned them to the company. Foreigners in Beiping believe that the anti-American movement that occurred in Shijiazhuang was carried out independently by local officials without the consent of senior Japanese military authorities.

<h3>Military Affairs Commission Announces Weekly Battle Report (Continued)</h3>
<p>Guangdong Front: The Japanese troops advancing on Zhongshan in the West River landed infantry in two routes from Japanese warships, adopting a pincer formation. One route, from Rongqi and Guizhou, advanced from north to south, while the other occupied Hengmen, Qiding Mountain, Dajian Mountain, and Furong Island before advancing from south to north. After several rounds of valiant resistance by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops in the north suffered losses and fled back to their ships. The Chinese army in the south, starting from the first day, encircled and fiercely attacked the Japanese forces in several routes for two days and nights. All areas of Qiding Mountain, Dajian Mountain, Rongqi, and Guizhou have been completely recovered. The remaining Japanese forces are being cleared up. At the same time, another unit of the Chinese army entered Jiujiang (southeast of Sanshui) on the morning of the second day. The vanguard is now approaching Sanshui, causing panic among the Japanese. The Chinese army, which launched another attack on Shantou, reached the suburbs at dawn on the 31st. The Japanese resisted stubbornly, but over 300 were killed by Chinese machine guns and artillery, and all Japanese fortifications were destroyed. A part of the remaining Japanese forces broke through and retreated to Anbu, where they were ambushed by the Chinese army, which launched a surprise attack on their flanks, causing them to collapse in disarray. Over 400 Japanese and puppet soldiers and police officers, including the puppet police commander Huang Liu, were annihilated. The situation on the North River front has been quiet for several days. The Japanese occasionally use small units to harass the areas of Conghua and Huaxian, but have not succeeded.</p>

In Hebei Province, we attacked Shijiazhuang and killed Colonel Mori of the Japanese Xiaoda Brigade. In southern Shandong, we attacked Linyi and Deping, destroying over 100 kilometers of Japanese highways and railways and burning down a large Japanese ammunition depot in Gaomi. In Huaiyuan, northern Anhui, we fought a bloody battle, killing over 500 Japanese soldiers. In northern Jiangxi, we inflicted heavy losses on the Japanese army that invaded Maogang from Nanchang and routed over 2,000 Japanese and puppet soldiers in Ruichang, killing a high-ranking Japanese commanding officer (whose name is being investigated). In Jiangnan, we cut off the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and advanced on Yuhang, achieving victories everywhere and reaping great war gains. This is specially reported here. (6th dispatch)</p>

<h3>Ten Million People Mobilized in Europe, Hoping to Maintain Armed Peace, British Air Defense Exercise Begins, Situation in Danzig Still Perilous</h3>
<p>(London) The British Air Force is scheduled to hold a large-scale exercise in the UK from tonight until Friday. 1,300 aircraft and 60,000 airmen will participate. It is reported that from 12:30 AM on Thursday night, London and 28 other counties will become a dark world, with blackouts lasting four hours in various locations. This air raid drill is very large and unprecedented since the German Air Force attacked London in May 1919. Local anti-aircraft artillery and searchlight units will cooperate closely with the airmen to defend against "enemy" aircraft. At the same time, all air defense units will be mobilized to rescue "injured" civilians and extinguish "burning" houses. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Twenty-six counties in southeastern England are scheduled to hold a large-scale air defense exercise starting at midnight tomorrow. In addition to 1,300 military aircraft, 10 barrage balloon squadrons and 200,000 members of the air defense force will participate. According to the planned program, several squadrons of bombers will first fly to Beauvais, France, and then return to the UK to conduct air raid exercises along the coast. At that time, all coastal areas will be subject to a blackout. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italy's week-long simulated war has concluded, with the defending side victorious. The attacking side was eventually driven back to the Alps. At night, the attacking "Red Army" attacked Turin from the air, threatening to destroy part of the industrial area or the railway terminal. However, at dawn, the defending "Blue Army" gained air superiority. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>Turin: The Italian army's large-scale exercise ended yesterday with a complete victory for the defending "Blue" team, which defeated the mock enemy at three locations in the Dora Valley. The Novara forces, along with the Blackshirt Legion and the "Blue" team, completely surrounded the "Red" team, forcing them to retreat into the Alps. The final battle began at 7:00 AM and ended at 11:30 AM. The Crown Prince and other senior officials were present to observe, but Prime Minister Mussolini was not. The "Blue" team's air force bombed the "Red" team in the morning, forcing them to retreat. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>

<p>(London) Newspapers here are commenting on the European situation, saying that although the European situation has eased somewhat after the Danzig Free City Council accepted the Polish government's demands regarding the issue of Polish customs officials' authority over the Danzig Free City customs, it remains very serious. The London Times stated that judging from the recent developments in the Danzig Free City customs dispute, both Poland's ability to restrain itself and the Free City authorities' ability to stop at the right time are sufficient. In the meantime, most people believe that the entire Danzig issue remains in a dangerous period, and a slight carelessness could trigger a crisis. As for the reply submitted by the City Council, the Polish side has already considered it "completely satisfactory." However, as for the full impact, Danzig City National Socialist Party leader Forster is currently in Berchtesgaden, Germany, listening to the instructions of Führer Hitler. It is impossible to make a judgment until the content of these instructions is known. The News Chronicle reported that the tense situation has eased somewhat after the exchange of notes between the Polish government and the Danzig City Council on the customs issue. It is gratifying to see that the National Socialist Party does not seem to be inclined to extremes. However, the overall situation has not improved as a result. European countries are also stepping up mobilization. The originator of this dangerous move is the concentration of German troops near the Polish border under the guise of exercises, hoping to use it to support its demands on the Danzig issue. This is naturally the reason for Poland to conscript reserves as a countermeasure. Various countries are therefore preparing one after another, with a total of 10 million troops concentrated, which has indeed formed "a large barracks." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The News Chronicle reports that there are currently 10 million troops in a state of war readiness in Europe. The mobilization of such a large number of troops makes the war crisis imminent. However, due to the strength of both sides, there is a balance of power. At present, the dictatorial countries do not appear to want to overthrow this balance of power by violence. What will happen in the future will depend on the strength of the peace front.

<h3>Large Amounts of European Gold Transferred to the Americas for Wartime Use</h3>
<p>(New York) According to financial sources here, Britain is now storing large amounts of gold in the United States and Canada for use in purchasing various supplies in wartime. Many other countries have also stored gold in the United States, most of which has been transferred since the European situation became tense in recent years. In June of this year, Britain continued to deposit gold worth 25 million US dollars, bringing the total in current accounts to 122.5 million US dollars. This is a special deposit and is not included in the total US financial resources reported by the US Treasury Department. Most of it is intended for wartime purchases of military supplies from the United States. Since Britain's preparations for war and the increasing tensions between the Axis and non-Axis countries, more and more gold has flowed into the United States, especially from Britain and the Netherlands. In addition to the deposits in New York, the deposits in Canada have reached 300 million US dollars, all from London. Therefore, the total amount of gold stored in North America is no less than 1.5 billion US dollars. The inflow has been greatest in the past two months and is still being shipped. In the past week, gold worth 25.5 million US dollars was shipped in, of which 19 million came from London and 5 million from the Netherlands. If Britain is caught in the vortex of war and needs to purchase military supplies from the United States, this deposit can maintain the price of the pound and prevent it from suffering violent fluctuations.

<h3>Poland and Danzig Agree to Negotiate, National Socialist Party Leader Visits Hitler Again, Polish Customs Official Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Warsaw: News has just been received here that Danzig Free City National Socialist Party leader Forster, accompanied by Czersky, the editor of the National Socialist Party's organ, the Danzig Vorposten, flew to Berchtesgaden, Germany, yesterday evening to visit Führer Hitler. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) There are no signs of easing in the Danzig situation. National Socialist Party leader Forster and Czersky have come to Berchtesgaden from the Free City on Forster's private plane to discuss everything with Hitler. The recent reply from the Danzig Senate to Poland's protest has not improved the situation. It is said that Poland is still dissatisfied with this reply. League of Nations High Commissioner for Danzig Burckhardt is making every effort to mediate and create a favorable atmosphere. The Senate's reply stated that it was surprising that Poland considered recent events to be grounds for submitting an "ultimatum." It also stated that the armed patrols of Polish customs officials were a violation of the treaty. Danzig had not excluded Polish customs inspectors from the border since August 6. The reply opposed Poland's threat of retaliation and expressed its willingness to discuss the matter. Political circles in Berlin believe that the Danzig Senate's reply offers the possibility of exchanging views on the customs issue. Various circles in Germany have dismissed as untrue the suggestion that the Senate has already made concessions. German newspapers have described this as a dangerous move by Poland to provoke war. Polish customs inspector Ribensky, who was arrested by the Danzig authorities two months ago, was tried yesterday on charges of espionage, etc. He was sentenced to 18 months in prison for insulting Hitler, Goebbels, and disrupting peace, among other things. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Regarding the Danzig Free City customs issue, the official here recently issued a communiqué stating that after Polish High Commissioner to Danzig Chodacki submitted a written communication to the City Senate on the 5th of this month, the City Senate authorities verbally agreed that they did not intend to take any action against the Polish customs officials, and did not place an "accomplished fact" before Poland, and pledged to submit a written reply within two days. This reply was delivered to Chodacki this morning. In addition to reiterating the verbal promises, it stated that neither the City Senate nor the customs authorities had prohibited Polish customs officials from exercising their functions. Poland's communication was based on unfounded rumors, and its tone was aggressive and amounted to an "ultimatum," which should be protested. Thereafter, Poland would still be able to maintain control over the various customs offices in the Danzig City, and the City Senate was willing to conduct negotiations with Poland on the entire customs issue. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Regarding the Danzig Free City customs issue, the reply submitted by the City Senate to the Polish government has just been commented on by people close to the government here, saying that Poland's position has not changed. It is willing to respond to the request of the Danzig City Senate and conduct negotiations with it, but on the condition that the legitimate rights of Polish customs officials are not infringed. Although the City Senate claims that it has not prohibited Polish customs officials from exercising their functions, it is true that on the 4th of this month, Polish customs officials in certain locations received a notice stating that they would no longer be allowed to wear uniforms, carry weapons, or perform their duties, otherwise they would be arrested. Then, at 11:00 PM on the 5th of this month, these customs officials received another notice stating that the above measures would be temporarily suspended. Until now, all Polish customs officials are still wearing uniforms and continuing to work. (Havas, 7th)</p>
<h3>Anglo-French-Soviet Alliance Political Negotiations Come to a Conclusion, British Envoy Returns Home to Resume Duty</h3>
<p>Stockholm: Strang, the head of the Central European Division of the British Foreign Office, who was in Moscow to conduct negotiations with Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov on the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, together with the British and French ambassadors to the Soviet Union, arrived here by plane from Moscow yesterday and flew back to London this morning.

<p>(London) Strang, the head of the Central European Division of the Foreign Office, returned home by plane from Moscow and is scheduled to arrive here at 4:45 PM today and report back to the Foreign Office tomorrow to resume his duties. According to well-informed sources, Sir Oliphant, the Assistant Under-Secretary of the Department, has recently been appointed as the Ambassador to Belgium, and the vacancy he left will be filled by Director Strang. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a Warsaw dispatch from the Daily Telegraph, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov has informed the Polish ambassador to Moscow and requested that Poland send a delegation to participate in the Anglo-French-Soviet military talks. It is reported that Soviet Minister of War Voroshilov has stated to Molotov that without Poland's participation, the military talks will not be effective. The Anglo-French military mission is currently heading to Moscow on a special ship and can land in Leningrad at the end of this week, and then take a train directly to Moscow. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Regarding the Anglo-French reports that Poland will send a military representative to participate in the Moscow staff talks, authoritative sources here have denied it, stating that the reports are completely inconsistent with the facts. Poland believes that the Moscow talks are only related to the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, so it will not send a representative to participate. (Haitong, 8th)</p>

<p>Burgos: Government officials here recently announced that the Nationalist government will be reorganized, and the result will be to increase the power of the Fascists and the military. It is expected that important government positions, such as the Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of the Interior, and Minister of Propaganda, will be filled by Fascist figures. Others, such as the Minister of Commerce, Minister of Finance, and Minister of Agriculture, will be filled by experts. The Minister of Military Affairs and the Minister of Public Security will be filled by military personnel. The position of Prime Minister will still belong to General Franco. Political figures believe that after the reorganization of the government, the national policy will remain the same, that is, to make the revitalization of Spain the most important task. The candidates for the heads of the newly established government departments and committees, such as the Political Committee and the National Assembly, will also be decided at the same time. In addition, the Secretary-General of the Spanish Falange will also be appointed. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<p>Burgos: Spanish Head of State General Franco is actively preparing for the cabinet reorganization, working up to 18 hours a day. Except for the Minister of the Interior, Suner (General Franco's brother-in-law), all other guests are refused audience. In addition, many leaders of the Falange and important generals have recently gathered here to listen to General Franco's consultations. Most of them have finished their business and left here.

<h3>Bulgarian Parliamentary Delegation Arrives in Moscow, First Time After the European War</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Bulgarian parliamentary delegation, led by Deputy Speaker Markov, arrived here today. Those who came to the station to welcome them included Gorkin, Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Bakov, Director of the Treaty Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, Haifetz, Vice Chairman of the Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, and Bulgarian Ambassador Antonov and his staff. (TASS, 7th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Twenty-five members of the Bulgarian Parliament have arrived here for a ten-day tour. This is the first semi-official or official visit to the Soviet Union from Bulgaria since the European War. Soviet Foreign Ministry officials and the Parliament Secretary greeted them at the train station. According to reliable sources here, this trip is only a gesture of goodwill between the two countries, and no negotiations are planned. The guests include the Vice President of the Bulgarian Parliament, the Director of the Budget Committee, and the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) British envoy Strang boarded a plane from here yesterday to return to London. The reasons for Britain's recall of Strang have not yet been announced. He represented Britain in negotiations with the Soviet Union on the conclusion of an Anglo-French-Soviet military alliance. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>Monstrosity: Heart Exposed Outside Chest, Breathing Normal</h3>
<p>(Manila) A woman named Rafael in a certain obstetrical hospital in the Tondo district here gave birth to a girl last night whose heart was completely outside her chest, and its beating was very normal. People nearby flocked to observe, causing extreme crowding, so the police had to come to the scene to maintain order. According to famous doctors who visited the hospital, the child's breathing is still good, but because the heart is exposed, her life is unlikely to exceed 24 hours. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>Continued report: The baby girl, who was born with a cry at 12:30 yesterday, has lived for more than 27 hours so far, even though her heart is exposed. This is quite surprising to ordinary doctors. Many famous doctors and important people (including the First Lady of the Philippines) have come to inspect. Some doctors have considered returning her heart to its original position, but after Dr. Yewell examined her with X-rays, he felt that it was impossible to perform surgery. Except for the exposed heart, other parts are no different from normal people. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Five-Minister Conference Convenes to Review Countermeasures to European Situation, Heated Debate for Five Hours Without Concrete Results, New Instructions from London Arrive in Tokyo One After Another, Anglo-Japanese Conference May Resume Today</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Five-Minister Conference carefully reviewed its European policy from 1:40 PM to 6:30 PM today. Because the ministers recognized the importance of the situation, they had to carefully consider all aspects, so the conference did not reach any conclusion and adjourned at 6:30 PM. The date of the next Five-Minister Conference has not yet been determined. (Domei, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After this morning's regular cabinet meeting, the five ministers immediately gathered at the Prime Minister's residence in the afternoon. The purpose was to decide on a practical plan to adapt Japanese policy to the new developments in the European situation since the government formulated its European policy on June 5. According to the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," the Five-Minister Conference was initiated by Minister of the Army Itagaki, who believed that formulating a policy centered on the new European situation and focusing on the China Incident was not only inextricably linked to the handling of the China Incident but was also an indispensable condition for ending the China Incident. However, after the Prime Minister and the four ministers of the Army, Navy, Foreign Affairs, and Finance discussed with each other for five hours, they still did not reach any concrete results. Cabinet Secretary Ota published an article saying that the Five-Minister Conference began at 1:40 PM and adjourned at 6:30 PM to review the European situation, but no decision was made, so the five ministers will consider the matter again. It is said that because the matter is of great importance, the Five-Minister Conference must proceed carefully, so today's afternoon meeting could not reach a decision immediately. It is expected that several more meetings will be held before a measure with far-reaching effects on Japan's future policy can be decided. Before asking the Prime Minister to convene the Five-Minister Conference, Minister of the Army Itagaki convened a meeting of the administrative officials of the Ministry of the Army to decide on the Army's attitude toward the new developments in the European situation. After a decision was made, he consulted with the three giants of the Army, namely the Chief of the General Staff, the Inspector General of Military Education, and the Minister of the Army. The three giants approved it at a meeting on August 3. On Saturday night, Minister of the Army informed the Prime Minister of the results, and yesterday afternoon he visited Minister of the Navy Yonai to discuss concrete measures for joint action on this extremely important issue. After informing the Prime Minister of the results of the consultation with the Minister of the Navy, Harada, the private secretary of Saionji, visited Saionji and reported on domestic and foreign affairs, and returned to Tokyo this morning. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to political figures here, the Japanese military has asked the government to take an unambiguous attitude towards the European situation. Military figures believe that for the sake of national defense interests and to ensure Japan's Far Eastern policy, Japan must take firm action in accordance with the principles decided by the Cabinet meeting on June 5. This proposal will be discussed in today's inner cabinet meeting. (Haitong, 8th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Judging from the situation, the Anglo-Japanese conference, which has been stalled for more than a week, may resume tomorrow. British Ambassador Craigie stayed at the Karuizawa summer resort for a few days and returned to Tokyo this afternoon. Instructions from London are now being transmitted to the British Embassy one after another. Japanese representative Miyamoto visited British representative Picot at the British Embassy at 10:40 this morning to arrange the Tokyo conference. At the same time, two British technical representatives, Tianjin British Police Chief Tainsh and British Embassy Secretary to China Allen, have left Tokyo and returned to China. According to observers here, the Anglo-Japanese conference, which may be held tomorrow, will determine the fate of the Tokyo Round Table Conference. However, it is worth noting that all parties are still optimistic. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese report that London instructions regarding the Chinese monetary system and the Tianjin British Concession Chinese silver case have been sent to the British Ambassador to Japan is inaccurate. The instructions are still under consideration but have not yet been issued. Reuters has learned that although a draft agreement on policing in the Tianjin British Concession has been drawn up, it is still under negotiation. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Anti-British Demonstrations in Kobe, Japan, German and Italian Residents Participate in March</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) There were two anti-British demonstrations in Kobe on Sunday. German and Italian residents of Kobe all participated. 100,000 people participated in the anti-British demonstrations that day. Many anti-British speeches were given, and many resolutions were passed, all demanding that the Japanese government take a tough stance against Britain. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<h3>US Continues to Buy Silver from China, Aiding China's Resistance Against Japan; 6 Million Ounces to be Purchased at Market Price; Chongqing Denies Ordering New Banknotes from Britain</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to informed sources, the US Treasury Department has agreed to purchase six million ounces of silver from China, paying the market price at the time of delivery. It is understood that the US sets the price for purchasing foreign silver at 35 cents per ounce. Based on this calculation, the Chinese government could receive $2.1 million. However, such transactions are traditionally kept secret by the government, so the Treasury Department declined to comment. Political figures said that the US policy of buying silver from China is beneficial to China's resistance against Japan and that this policy has been decided to be continuously implemented without any relaxation. This can be seen from this. (Havas News Agency, 7th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Central Bank authorities today formally denied recently ordering a large number of banknotes from two British companies in London. It is understood that news recently spread from London that the Chinese government and the Central Bank had signed two contracts to print over one billion banknotes in total. One of the contracts has already been completed, and the other is expected to be completed in a year. In response to this, Ministry of Finance personnel told a Reuters reporter that the London news gave the impression that the two contracts were newly signed and that the Chinese government was preparing to start inflation. In fact, the formulation of the two contracts was more than two years ago. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Cabinet Meeting; Arita Reports on Diplomacy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) At this morning's regular cabinet meeting, the depreciation of Chinese legal tender was one of the matters discussed. Regarding the Anglo-Japanese round table conference, Foreign Minister Arita said that meetings could continue today or tomorrow, as the British representative had stated that as soon as instructions were received from his government, the meetings could resume. The instructions were just sent from London, so the Anglo-Japanese conference should be able to continue today or Wednesday after the full instructions arrive. Britain was unable to send instructions earlier because it was consulting with relevant countries on the economic issues of Tianjin, Arita continued. Regarding the Japanese oil and coal concession rights in Northern Sakhalin, Arita said that the Soviet government attaches great importance to collective labor contracts, considering them a prerequisite for resolving all outstanding issues in Northern Sakhalin. However, since the representative of the Japanese oil and coal concession rights has already signed a collective labor contract with the Far Eastern Soviet trade union, the Japanese government intends to accelerate negotiations with the Soviet government to resolve all long-standing unresolved issues in Northern Sakhalin on the basis of this contract. Arita, Minister of Commerce Hatta, and Minister of Finance Ishiwata then presented reports on the depreciation of legal tender, and the cabinet members exchanged opinions on the plan that Japan should adopt to deal with the depreciation of legal tender, which lasted about forty minutes.

<h3>British Defense in Singapore Greatly Enhanced; Army and Air Force Arrive in Steady Streams; Sufficient to Resist Any Foreign Invasion</h3>
<p>Singapore. A squadron of twin-engined Mohawk bombers flew in here yesterday from India. This flight team includes thirty-six bombers, eight transport bombers, and four airships. The air force strength here has immediately doubled. The Sunderland airship team is already here, so the arrival of this new flight team makes Singapore capable of resisting any foreign invasion. The arrival of this new flight team is extremely necessary, because the old two flight teams stationed here, except for a few new types of aircraft, are mostly old. Those who doubted the strength of the Singapore air force have been completely relieved since the new team that flew in from India yesterday arrived here. The Agal Army team also arrived here this morning. Eight thousand soldiers will arrive here later this week. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>(Singapore) A large British army unit and three Indian army units have now arrived here from India. To date, 4,000 troops have arrived here from India. One battalion belonging to the 14th Ben Zhepu Regiment, which arrived here today, will travel by train to Penang tomorrow. At least two more ships loaded with troops will arrive here this week, including artillerymen, sappers, medical teams, etc., carrying complete equipment, such as artillery and ambulances.

<h3>Roosevelt Signs Bill Adjusting US-Philippine Economy; British Newspaper Says US Retention of Philippines Will Be Cornerstone of Far East Peace</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt today signed a bill adjusting the relationship between the United States and the Philippines to prepare for Philippine independence in 1946. The bill stipulates the duty-free amount of coconut oil, embroidery, tobacco, and buttons imported from the Philippines to the United States until 1946. (Reuters, 7th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph said that the United States' relationship with the Philippine Islands will be a serious issue in American politics. If the United States implements its announced intention to establish an independent Philippine Republic in 1946, it will lead to the evil consequence of the Philippines being invaded by Japan. This is certainly not the original intention of the US plan. Previous proposals to amend the method of Philippine independence have not been welcomed by the Filipino people. However, the Far East incident may now make them have a second thought about maintaining the benefits of the American flag. The United States may listen to the Filipinos' self-determination, and the main factor in shaping Filipino public opinion will be the success or failure of Japan's continental ambitions. MacArthur, who resigned as Resident Commissioner to the Philippines a few weeks ago, recently gave a speech at the University of Virginia in the United States, arguing that the United States should not abandon the Philippines, saying that if the United States abandons it, it will lose its right to speak in Eastern diplomacy and make the islands between Kamchatka and Borneo in the hands of foreigners, becoming a blockade line for US-China trade. Many Filipinos know that from a spiritual standpoint, independence is very pleasant to hear, but independence may become a transfer of sovereignty. To solve this problem, there is a strategy: in the political aspect, the United States maintains its flag and sovereignty in the Philippines, allowing the Filipinos as much autonomy as possible, but still holding the rights to diplomacy, tariffs, immigration, currency, and public debt. In the event of an incident, the United States should assist in maintaining the civil foundation of the Philippine government. In the economic aspect, the United States gives the Filipinos the best opportunity for trade, limited to not harming American producers. If the United States and the Philippines establish a permanent political and economic relationship, it will be the best method, because the Filipinos are willing to have it, and the United States is not imposing sovereignty on others. When the American flag hangs in the Philippines, the Philippines will be the cornerstone of the structure of peace in the Far East. Once the American flag is removed, turmoil will follow for at least a generation. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<h3>Anti-Chinese Movement in Siam Instigated by Japan; Propaganda Also Directed at Burma</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to news from here today, the recent anti-Chinese movement in Siam was mostly instigated by Japanese propaganda. At the same time, Japan is now also vigorously conducting propaganda in Burma in order to alienate Burma's relationship with China. The Japanese method of propaganda is to say that since the completion of the Burma Road, many Chinese laborers have traveled along the road to Burma. If Burma does not prohibit this, it will affect the relationship between Burma and China, because Chinese laborers have low wages, which may affect the lives of Burmese workers. (Associated Press, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) It is rumored that the Kingdom of Siam (newly renamed Thailand) has joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. The Siamese embassy here firmly denied this. (Havas News Agency, 8th)</p>

<h3>True Record of a Southwest Journey</h3>
<p>Zhennanguan is a military fortress, so there are no markets or villages there except for the gate and public offices. All daily necessities are obtained from Aikou, more than ten miles away from the gate. The Longzhou Customs Branch is located here. Foreign travelers and goods must be inspected here, so the market in Aikou has gradually prospered. It gathers merchants, drivers, and government transportation personnel. The number of hotels and inns has gradually increased. By noon, it is bustling with noise. Cars can be received from inside the town to outside the town, stretching for one or two miles, slowly waiting for inspection one by one. When the traffic is crowded, it can take a day and a half, so in reality, Zhennanguan cannot be considered Aikou, but it is really a difficult pass. From Fengxiang to Nanning, the route passes through Mingjiang and two ferry crossings. The river surface from Mingjiang Ferry to outside Nanning City is wider, and there are many ferry boats, so it may not take much time.</p>
<p>After Nanning was bombed, the market is not as good as before. Most stores on the most prosperous Minsheng Road and Xingning Road open after 3 pm. Most of the goods have been evacuated to the opposite bank outside the city, so Delin Road is quite lively. It is said that prices are cheaper here than in Liuzhou and above. Most stores can only maintain the status quo and cannot talk about development, but several new banks have opened, such as the China Farmers Bank, which has already opened, so finance is quite active. The most strange thing is that exchanging Vietnamese currency here is cheaper than in Vietnam, which travelers should know.</p>
<p>6. Liuzhou, the Center of Transportation</p>
<p>Liuzhou is located in the center of Guangxi. The Guinan section of the future Hunan-Guangxi Railway and various highways must pass through it. The waterway controls the hub of the Liujiang River. Downstream, it can directly reach Wuzhou, so after the outbreak of the war, it became one of the centers of transportation in the Southwest. From Nanning to here, the entire journey is 260 kilometers, and the journey takes about eight hours, but north of Binyang, you must cross the main stream and tributary of the Qianjiang River twice, which takes a lot of time. The scenery on this line is very good. North of Qianjiang, mountains rise from the flat ground. The car winds through the mountains with no support, and there is really a situation of beautiful scenery that cannot be fully appreciated. Especially north of Datang, there are sixty miles of continuous mountain peaks, which can be called the Yellowstone Park of China without any shame.</p>
<p>Binyang is the branching point of the highways to Guixian and Wuzhou, and Datang is the branching point of the highways to Guiyang, so these two places occupy an important position on the Yiliu line. Generally, people from Liuzhou or Guixian to Nanning, or from Guixian to Liuzhou, mostly have lunch in Binyang. Those from Nanning or Yishan to Liuzhou mostly have lunch in Datang.</p>
<p>Liuzhou is surrounded by the Liujiang River. Hebei is the urban area, and Henan is the industrial and transportation area. Vehicles from all directions are concentrated in Henan. The tool for crossing the river used to be a pontoon bridge, which was very convenient. Recently, it was washed away by a flood, so you have to use ferries. There is now an electric ferry that travels back and forth every ten minutes. In addition, there are many small cabin ships that also carry passengers, departing when there are twelve people, costing five cents per person. If there are few people and you want to depart early, you have to pay this amount.</p>
<p>People with slightly inferior foot strength feel overwhelmed by the uphill and downhill slopes when crossing the river, so for the convenience of taking a car, it is advisable to live in Henan. If you want to stay for a few days, it is better to live in Hebei. Even from a safety point of view, although there are many caves in Henan, Hebei has not been bombed so far. This is also one of the reasons why I advocate living in Hebei.</p>
<p>There are always more than one hundred cars of various types running every night to morning in the Henan area. There are really a lot of passing guests, so travelers and hotels are extremely developed. However, these kinds of hotels do not welcome long-term guests. Most of the hotels are simple and crude, and there is no equipment at all. The reception of the tea room is even more careless. Except for a brief moment in the morning when they are slightly nervous to greet guests to get on the car, the rest of the time, they ignore you when you call them, either dozing off or humming a tune, so conflicts between guests and tea rooms are commonplace.</p>
<p>The market in Hebei only has three horizontal streets, intertwined with four or five straight streets. Among them, Peixin Road, which is directly opposite the ferry terminal, and Qingyun Road to the north are the most lively, forming a T-shape horizontally and vertically. All bookstores, banks, and restaurants are concentrated on these two streets. Qingyun Road in particular has become the cultural street of Liuzhou. The Commercial Press and other bookstores are all located here.</p>
<p>Speaking of food, you can actually taste the flavors of various places in Liuzhou. Not to mention Guangdong restaurants, other restaurants such as Beijing restaurants, Sichuan restaurants, and even Shandong restaurants and Ningbo restaurants are available, but the prices are expensive. However, because there are many passing guests, every family is crowded. However, banquets are mostly held in the evening. At noon, they are afraid of air raids, so the stores operate with their doors half-closed. Although other restaurants do not have this situation, many are afraid that guests will leave in a rush after eating halfway and encountering an air raid without paying the bill, so they collect the money first. The most interesting thing is the tea room. You pay each time you take a plate of dim sum, which has the flavor of a foreign automatic "wheel taking" machine. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Statistics of Japanese Aircraft Disturbing Zhejiang in the Past Six Months; Over Two Thousand Bombs Dropped</h3>
<p>Fangyan Communication, In the past six months, the Japanese navy has been conducting guerrilla harassment along the Chinese coast, and has also been wantonly bombing with airplanes. According to the Zhejiang Provincial Government War Industry report, the following statistics have been compiled from various places. From January to June of this year, the counties in the province were air raided by Japanese aircraft a total of 625 times, dropping 2,000 bombs, destroying 2,408 houses, injuring 444 people, and killing 336 people. The houses destroyed had little military value, and the people killed and injured were not military personnel. On average, Japanese aircraft drop one bomb and destroy one and a half houses, and injure less than one person. Japanese aircraft must drop six bombs to kill one old and weak Chinese person.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army on the Border of Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui; Operates Under Cover of the Green Screen; Annihilates Japanese Troops by the Bu Lao River; Railway Tracks on the Jinpu and Longhai Lines Destroyed; Wounded Japanese Soldiers Gather in Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Communication, The Japanese army headquarters in Xuzhou considers the undulating mountains and green screen everywhere on the border of Jiangsu and Shandong northeast of Xuzhou to be the base camp for the lurking activities of the Chinese guerrilla teams. The Japanese commander Washizu specially dispatched more than 200 mechanized soldiers on six large trucks, with one tank, and carrying four heavy artillery pieces, departing from Liuquan Jiawang, crossing the Bu Lao River in Huzhuang, attempting to sweep the Chinese army in the Jiangsu, Shandong, and Anhui border area from the northeastern mountains. The Han Zhilong unit of the column reported in advance, and first ambushed some of its troops in several directions. When the Japanese army was halfway across the river, it launched a joint encirclement and attack. Although the Japanese army relied on its fierce artillery fire to cover and the tanks and cars charged horizontally and vertically, the artillery fire and tanks were ineffective due to the undulating terrain, rocky terrain, and the obstruction and concealment of the sorghum stalks. The Chinese army was even more familiar with the terrain, and surrounded the Japanese army. After a day and night of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was unable to support itself, so it concentrated its firepower on one point and broke through the encirclement and fled the next morning. In this battle, 48 Japanese officers and soldiers were killed or wounded, and two cars were destroyed. The Chinese army also suffered 13 casualties, and seized 19 boxes of artillery shells, 52 rounds of machine gun bullets, seven pairs of leather boots, and 12 meal bags.</p>
<p>Also, guerrilla teams of the Chinese army in Xuzhou, Huaihai and other places are now actively using the green screen for concealment. In addition to attacking Japanese barracks and intercepting important information from time to time, they are also continuing to destroy the railway tracks on the Jinpu and Longhai lines, and the highways in the counties are also cut off from time to time. The Japanese army is unable to defend against it, and recently specially increased the number of defense troops at each station along the Jinpu and Longhai lines, and forcibly drafted strong men, trained them, and assigned them to protect the roads. They also forced the people to cut down all the sorghum within 1,200 meters on both sides of the railway, but the people ignored it.</p>
<p>The Washizu Division of the Japanese army in Xuzhou has been attacked by the Chinese army from time to time in eastern Henan, northern Anhui, and southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu, and has suffered heavy casualties. The dead are mostly cremated on the spot, and the ashes are transported back to the country to the north. Those who are lightly wounded are sent to field hospitals for treatment, and those who are seriously wounded are sent to Tianjin starting from July 20th, with four sections attached to the trains going north from Xubei. About 150 people are transported from Xubei every day. As for the Chinese compatriots from the Northeast or other places who are conscripted, those who are slightly injured in combat are treated, and those who are slightly more seriously injured are cremated together with the dead. Therefore, in the crematorium in the south of Xuzhou, there are often cries for help from Chinese compatriots who are burned due to injuries, and those who hear it are saddened.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army in Jiaxing; Conscripts Laborers; Over 500 People Have Been Conscripted</h3>
<p>Jiaxing Communication, The puppet county government recently received instructions from the Japanese side to conscript laborers to rush to build a military highway in the suburbs of Jiaxing to Jiashan. The puppet county chief Shen Hanqing convened a joint meeting of various puppet ward and baojia chiefs, deciding that able-bodied men aged 17 to 37 must serve three days a month. If they do not obey the order to report, they will be fined 30 cents per person per day. If they deliberately resist, they will be severely punished according to military law. However, since the various puppet ward chiefs have been organizing it, it has been difficult to implement it for a while due to various difficulties, and the Japanese army has been urging it strictly. The puppet county government was unable to cope with it, so it secretly instructed the Japanese army to conscript, and instigated the Japanese side, so that the Japanese army went to various transportation hubs to conscript in large numbers at noon the other day. It is said that more than 500 people were conscripted.</p>
<h3>Currency System in the Occupied Areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang; Great Chaos; People Believe in Legal Tender; Refuse to Use Counterfeit Money in Circulation</h3>
<p>Suzhou Communication, Since the use of Jinlu Han banknotes in Shanghai has affected the occupied areas, the situation in the Jinghu Hangzhou area is special. In addition to the legal tender of the central Jiao Nong Si Hang, Japanese currency, military notes, and "Huaxing" counterfeit money are also commonly used in the market. Other legal tender from the five provinces in North China and banknotes from the local banks in Anhui, Zhejiang, and Xuzhou are not commonly used, resulting in extreme chaos in the market. The puppet side took the opportunity to wheel in counterfeit money and force the people to use it, but the people still absolutely believe in legal tender, and the central Jiao Nong Si Hang is the most popular among the people. Furthermore, because copper coins have disappeared, they are replaced by stamps, or each acts on its own and issues bamboo coin tokens, which are randomly mixed and used. It is true that the people in the occupied areas are in a situation where they cannot get what they want and cannot find a way to die. In places like Nanjing, the general poor people and illiterate poor people suffer greatly because they cannot find a place to exchange the Jiao votes from the Xuzhou Guanqian Bureau and the Anhui Bank after receiving them. There have been riots in which stores were destroyed. The puppet side was greatly alarmed, so it explained to the merchants and persuaded them to continue to accept the Xuzhou and Anhui Jiao votes without discounts, and arrested several store owners who refused to use them, fining them to appease the general small-scale vendors. In fact, they are still forcing the use of counterfeit money, falsely claiming that North China has refused to use the old legal tender. Rumors are rife, and it is difficult to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Intentions of the Japanese Army's Invasion of Zhongshan; To Rob and Harvest Mature Rice; Japanese Warships Have Already Retreated from Hengmen</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Communication, For two weeks, the Japanese army invading Guangdong has invaded Zhongshan in three routes, by land and sea, and fierce battles have occurred along the coast of Zhongshan County. In mid-July, the situation in Zhongshan suddenly became tense, and the authorities had already prepared for it. On the 24th, the Japanese army indeed mobilized two gunboats and several speedboats from Humen and berthed at the Hengmen estuary in Zhongshan. At about 3 pm, 600 to 700 Japanese soldiers were transported by transport ships, and they took more than 40 speedboats to rush into the Hengmen blockade line. They first removed the obstacles and then fired artillery from the Japanese warships to bombard the shore, destroying the defense positions of the shore defense troops. The Japanese Marines then landed on the perimeter of Hengmen Inner River. At that time, the Chinese defense forces fought fiercely, sacrificing more than half of them. In the end, because of the disparity in numbers and the difficulty in resisting the fierce bombardment of the Japanese artillery, they moved their positions to Maoshengwei. On the morning of the 25th, the Japanese army advanced inland, occupied Ma'anshan along the coast, and suddenly advanced to Xiaomen. When they reached Xiaomen, they divided their troops to harass Mazi. One route crossed Maoshengwei and approached Dagangshan. The 5th, 6th, and 7th companies of the Zhongshan defense forces blocked and attacked separately. Fierce battles took place in the surrounding fields and in the area of Mazixiang. The 7th company suffered heavy casualties and retreated to Banzishan and other places in Maosheng. At the same time, the Japanese army moved the Dagangshan artillery position to Pinglangshan. At dusk, the Chinese army counterattacked Yangtianluo (place name) and held each other with the Japanese army on Xingling until dawn. The Japanese army opened fire remotely again. In order to avoid artillery fire, the Chinese army withdrew beyond the range of the Japanese steel guns, using Xiaqishan at the junction of Shanzhou and Licun as a harassment point. The Japanese army then occupied Dongliwei, completely looting the rice and livestock in the area. At the same time, they used speedboats to remove the mines at the Hengmen estuary. The Japanese army wanted to invade Xiaqishan to spy on Shiqi, so they invaded Licun again. On the evening of the 29th, the two sides fought a night battle again and finally invaded the village, hoping to advance to Shiqi City along the highway. The next day (30th), the Japanese army sent planes to bomb Dachuan Village near Shiqi, in order to prevent the Chinese army from reinforcing. Hundreds of houses in the nearby villages were destroyed by Japanese bombs. The situation in Shiqi was particularly tense at this time. People dispersed one after another, and those who walked to Qianshan and Macau to take refuge were endless. The Zhongshan overseas compatriots temporarily lived in Macau and set up a relief association to accommodate the refugees. The Qiguan Highway passenger car was changed to night travel to avoid Japanese air raids, but the driving was uncertain and the traffic was extremely congested. As for the waterway from Shiqi to Macau, all inland river vessels were completely suspended due to the Japanese warships. On the 28th, Japanese warships once approached the inner river of Leishi in Shiqi and bombarded Shiqi, eight shells landed in the city, destroying many houses in the Old Prison Street and Shizi Street, and killing and injuring dozens of people. The stone fortress is located in the west of Shiqi. Although the Japanese shallow-water warships can sail there, the sailors did not dare to land. However, it is just a kind of restraint. On the 30th, the Chinese army reinforced, one route guarded Xiaqishan, and the other route attacked from Mazi. Because the Japanese army was weak and this time was purely to rob and harvest rice and stored grain in Zhongshan (Zhongshan has always been famous for producing rice), they used artillery to control it on the one hand, and sent engineers to rob and harvest the mature rice as much as possible. Therefore, the grain produced in Qiqingwei, Shiqingwei, Suishengwei, Boliwei, Maodewei, and other rice fields was almost entirely taken by the Japanese army. After holding each other for about a week, the Japanese army's robbing and harvesting work was about to be completed. The harvested grain was transported away by ships. It seems that this goal has been achieved and there is no intention to attack Shiqi again. It is said that the Japanese warships in Hengmen have begun to retreat. This kind of action is purely a kind of looting career, and has no great political significance. (August 2nd)</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Blockade Fujian's Maritime Trade: Sunken Civilian Vessels off Fuzhou and Quanzhou; Mines Planted for Long-Term Blockade</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Japanese warships, numbering as many as thirty, concentrated off the coast of Minhou, Lianjiang, Changle, and Fuqing counties at the mouth of the Min River during late June and early July. They incessantly bombed Fuzhou, Yanping, Xinghua, and various locations on both banks of the Min River mouth, including Changmen, Meihua, Guantou, Min'an, and Mawei. Simultaneously, they colluded with pirates to seize islands in the eastern Fujian Sea, such as Haitan (Pingtan County), Chuanshi, Nanri, Dongsha, Nangantang, and Mazu'ao, attempting to threaten Fuzhou. However, due to the strict and comprehensive defense arrangements along the Chinese coast, the Japanese found no opportunity to exploit. Instead, they sank hundreds of civilian vessels seized along the coast and laid mines off Chuanshi Island at the mouth of the Min River, creating a blockade to prevent ships of all nations from navigating the area. They then shifted their focus to southern Fujian. On July 14th, some warships from the mouth of the Min River were sent to the waters off Quanzhou port, with fifteen Japanese warships and ten speedboats anchored off the coast of Jinjiang and Hui'an counties. They notified the Quanzhou Taikoo &amp; Co. that they would land at 8:00 AM on the 15th. Upon hearing this news, the people of Quanzhou became extremely anxious, and many fled overnight to nearby Nan'an, Yongchun counties, and rural areas. Around 9:00 AM on the 15th, Japanese warships indeed dispatched three speedboats carrying over forty soldiers, who secretly landed at Dakou in Hui'an County and conducted extensive searches. However, they retreated around 2:00 PM. After the 16th, due to the intense counterattack by Chinese forces in the Chaozhou-Shantou area and the escalating situation, the Japanese warships off Quanzhou port and the mouth of the Min River were sent to reinforce those areas, leaving only five or six ships behind, with little activity. However, the Japanese warships in Quanzhou port, imitating the methods used at the mouth of the Min River, looted over a hundred civilian vessels along the coast, transporting the food and goods on board to Dazhui Island for storage. They stationed sailors on the island to monitor the goods and observe the movement of ships, while simultaneously sinking vessels in the waters off the mouth of Quanzhou port, attempting a long-term blockade. As a result, no ships can enter or leave the commercial ports of Fuzhou and Quanzhou, and foreign trade has come to a standstill.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Huai'an Attempt to Invade in Three Routes, Failing in Their Ambition; Puppet Maintenance Committee Chairman Arrested</h3>
<p>Huai'an Dispatch: The day before yesterday afternoon, over a hundred Japanese and puppet troops, armed with small cannons and machine guns, left the south gate and advanced towards Yueqiao in three routes. One route, consisting of about twenty soldiers wearing white cloth shirts and pants, advanced from Longguang Pavilion in a zigzag formation, attempting to blend in with the Chinese civilians. Another route, consisting of about forty soldiers wearing military uniforms of varying blue and white colors, advanced from the southern bank of the Shi Dai River. A third route, consisting of about forty soldiers wearing gray-yellow military uniforms, advanced towards Yueqiao from the barren fields of Chen Zhaobin behind Longguang Pavilion. They were followed by thirty or forty coolies carrying wheat stalks and fuel, preparing to set fire. As the three routes of Japanese and puppet troops left the city, they continuously fired small cannons and machine guns, and when they reached the north and south bridges, they encountered a fierce battle with a battalion of the Chinese army. The artillery fire from both sides was intense. Platoon Leader Tong Ying fired three consecutive mortar shells at the Japanese troops from the west of Heshangzhuang. The Japanese troops retaliated with seven small cannons from the north and south bridges, with the shells landing in the bathing ponds and rice paddies of Wang San Hotel in Heshangzhuang. During the intense fighting, the Japanese troops ordered dozens of coolies to set fire to the houses along both banks of the north and south bridges, destroying forty to fifty houses. Seeing the fire in front, the Chinese troops bravely advanced, with the battalion commander personally directing the charge at the front line, while simultaneously sending a team to encircle the Japanese troops from the rear. By around 4:00 PM, the Japanese troops were tightly surrounded. Seeing their retreat cut off, the Japanese troops stubbornly resisted. At this time, the Japanese troops on the West Gate artillery platform, seeing the Japanese troops outside the city surrounded by the Chinese army, continuously bombarded the Chinese troops with small cannons. The Japanese troops also used small cannons and machine guns as cover, allowing them to retreat into the city. In this battle, seven or eight Japanese and puppet troops were killed or wounded, along with one horse. The Chinese army suffered one platoon leader, Zhu Changchun, killed in action, and five or six soldiers wounded. Several civilians were also killed or wounded.</p>
<p>After the puppet vice-chairman of the Huai'an puppet Maintenance Committee, Ding Zhenchang, was captured by the Chinese army, the Japanese troops ordered the committee to move into the city to operate. The puppet chairman, Ye Yangwen, accepted the order and entered the city. However, the puppet Director of Public Security, Yu Bing'ou, the puppet Director of Security, Zheng Houzhi, and the puppet Youth Corps Leader, Dong Bing, set up barriers and only opened them once when there were many people. After 3:00 PM, they completely prohibited entry and exit. Yu and others also engaged in forced extortion, leaving no evil deeds undone, causing the people to suffer immensely. Furthermore, the puppet Director of Security and Youth Corps Leader of Huai'an, Liu Binshan, and the puppet Secretary of the Maintenance Committee, Li Fubin, are now suspected by the Japanese troops of harboring intentions to defect and have been placed under surveillance.</p>
<h3>Chinese Army Kills Japanese Troops at the South Gate of Jiangyin</h3>
<p>Jiangyin Dispatch: The Shizi Street area near the south gate, up to Duanming Bridge, is primarily an industrial zone. After the war, the area is sparsely populated. The Yingfu Bridge, located nearby, is well under the control of the guerilla forces. The Japanese troops stationed ten soldiers in the ancestral hall of the Qian family, located between Shizi Street and Duanming Bridge, to check passengers on the ships and passing vessels and to levy exorbitant taxes. Around 11:00 AM on the 2nd of this month, three Japanese soldiers went to the bridge to purchase goods and were suddenly attacked by the guerrilla forces, resulting in the immediate death of two soldiers. The guerrillas then threw a grenade to demonstrate their strength. After about ten minutes, the Japanese troops rushed out from the city. The residents of the boatmen community in Shizi Street outside the south gate fled. The Japanese troops conducted a house-to-house search, and after several hours, the Japanese troops retreated back into the city.</p>

<h3>Shanghai to Resume Alert State from This Morning; Full Mobilization and Joint Defense by Both Concessions; Roads Leading to Western District All Blocked</h3>
<p>The precautions of the Public and French Concessions went into effect, one after the other, starting from 10:30 last night. Their planning and defense are more comprehensive and meticulous than before. On the French Concession side, after 10:30 PM, the major entrances and exits along Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch were first sealed off. Except for Rue Jules Ferry, Rue de la Caserne, Avenue des Soeurs, Rue Amiral Bayle, Avenue de Notre Dame, and Avenue Albert, which were left as entrances and exits and had armed soldiers and detectives stationed to strictly inspect all pedestrians and vehicles, the remaining entrances and exits of all roads were blocked with barbed wire, temporarily cutting off traffic. On the Public Concession side, preparations began around midnight. All roads in the bustling city area that lead to Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch were restricted in the same way as the French Concession. For example, the Bund, Jiangxi Road, Henan Road, Shandong Road, Zhejiang Road, Guangxi Road, Yunnan Road, Avenue Edward Ezra, and Chengdu Road were all cut off to traffic, while Sichuan Road, Fujian Road, Nanking Road, Race Course Road, Chongqing Road, Tongfu Road, Seymour Road, Hardoon Road, and Hart Road were left with only side roads for access, which were also subject to strict inspection. Armored vehicles and security vehicles were also dispatched to patrol within their respective boundaries, especially in the border areas, where the defenses were even tighter.</p>
<p>Special Precautions Started Early</p>
<p>The second anniversary of the Shanghai Battle is approaching. For the sake of safety within their boundaries, the authorities of the two concessions in this city have adopted joint precautionary measures and banned any gatherings starting from the 6th. The work of searching pedestrians on the roads has also been intensified. In view of the tense situation, it has been decided to start special precautions from this morning. All police personnel in the two concessions have been fully mobilized. As for traffic on the roads, it is not intended to be blocked except on the 13th. These precautions will last until late at night on the 15th, when they may be lifted. However, if the situation is good, they may be shortened temporarily.</p>
<p>Shanghai Volunteer Corps Ordered to Mobilize</p>
<p>The headquarters of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps, commanded by General Fessenden, has been ordered to summon all national members of the corps. After receiving the order, General Fessenden issued an order this morning to prepare for full mobilization. The units include: 1. The light cavalry of the cavalry regiment, the American cavalry regiment; 2. The armored car company and the C-type machine gun company of the combined regiment, and the translation team of the Chinese company; 3. The British A and B companies, the Scottish company, the Jewish company, and the anti-aircraft company of the A-type battalion; 4. The American, Filipino, Portuguese, and other companies of the B-type battalion, and the American machine gun company; 5. The White Russian Volunteer Company of the D-type battalion have all been mobilized. From 6:00 AM tomorrow, they must wear uniforms and go to the writing office to work, ready to report for duty and move out within ten minutes of receiving the order. The armored car company will move out first.</p>
<p>Traffic in the Suburbs to be Blocked</p>
<p>The Japanese and puppet sides are deeply afraid that Chinese guerrillas will take the opportunity to launch a surprise attack and are extremely panicked. Therefore, they have already built defensive fortifications in the four suburbs of Shanghai, added Japanese and puppet troops and police to guard them, and will block traffic in the Pujiang, Beixinjing, Minhang, and Zhabei areas. All small boats operating on the inland rivers will be temporarily suspended from the 12th.</p>
<p>"Badlands" of Western Shanghai to be Blocked</p>
<p>According to the North-China Daily News, at 5:00 AM on the morning of the 9th, the defense forces and police of the Public and French Concessions will mobilize to prepare for the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle. At that time, Shanghai will resume the familiar scene of armed defense. Today (the 8th) throughout the day and early tomorrow morning, public works department coolies are erecting barbed wire barriers in various parts of the city. All bridges and roads leading to the "badlands" of western Shanghai will be blocked.</p>
<p>Precautions More Stringent Than Before</p>
<p>According to an announcement by the headquarters of the Public Concession Police Department yesterday, the precautionary measures will be the same as those implemented last year, but will be generally strengthened. The curfew will remain unchanged but will be strictly enforced regardless of nationality. Extra police patrols will patrol the troublesome western, central, and Putu Road factory areas, as well as the Bund. British defense forces, the US Marine Corps, and the Shanghai Volunteer Corps will assist the police in maintaining patrols and search teams in various districts.</p>
<p>Special Police to Deploy This Morning</p>
<p>Special police are scheduled to deploy at 5:00 AM tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning) to assume their duties, which will last until the "dispersal" order is issued on August 14th. The Shanghai Volunteer Corps will carry full equipment and be on standby from 5:00 AM tomorrow morning (i.e., this morning) at their offices until 5:00 AM on Sunday morning. The French Concession authorities will implement the measures taken on the anniversary of the July 7th incident and will fully cooperate with the Public Concession authorities. During the precautions, all defense forces in this port will be recalled from leave so that every soldier can effectively perform their duties.</p>
<h3>Japan Plans to Monopolize All of China's Shipping Industry: Organization of the East Asia Shipping Company; North and South Seas Shipping Routes Included; Third-Party Shipping Industry Devastated</h3>
<p>After the coastal ports and Yangtze River waterways of China were occupied by the Japanese army, foreign shipping vessels were regarded with extreme suspicion, with numerous instances of obstructing shipping and detaining ships. However, Japanese merchants were still unable to exclusively enjoy the benefits, feeling dissatisfied. Therefore, they meticulously planned to achieve their goals. Thus, a large-scale shipping organization has recently been formed. The following is a brief overview of the organization:</p>
<p>Organization of the East Asia Shipping Company</p>
<p>After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, all coastal areas were under Japanese control. Subsequently, as the Chinese army retreated westward, Japanese warships sailed up the Yangtze River, and Nanjing, Jiujiang, and Hankou fell one after another, the entire Yangtze River was occupied. The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha took the opportunity to resume operations, falsely claiming military transport, resulting in a thriving loan and transport business. Although foreign merchants repeatedly proposed to resume shipping, the Japanese side used military reasons as an excuse, preventing them from doing so. Therefore, Nisshin Kisen Kaisha continues to exclusively enjoy the profits. However, it is unable to exclusively enjoy the benefits in South and North China, feeling dissatisfied and constantly seeking a solution. Thus, the large-scale "East Asia Shipping Company" organization was formed, and the inaugural meeting was held in Tokyo on the 5th of this month, with a capital of 73 million yen. The organization is composed of Japanese shipping companies.</p>
<p>Most Japanese Ships Join</p>
<p>As for ships, they are allocated by various companies. The capital is estimated based on the value of the allocated ships. The companies in this city include Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK Line), Osaka Shosen Kaisha (OSK Line), Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (NKK Line), Kinkai Yusen Kaisha (KYK Line) (formerly managed by NYK Line), Mitsui Bussan Kaisha, Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha (K Line), Okazaki Kisen Kaisha, Awa Kuni Kyodo Kisen Kaisha, Harada Kisen Kaisha, Yamashita Kisen Kaisha, and Daito Kaiun Co., Ltd., a total of eleven companies. However, Dalian Kisen Kaisha, Showa Kisen Kaisha, and Kokusai Kaiun Kaisha have not participated. In the future, branches will be established in sixteen trading ports in China, Taiwan, and Japan. The Shanghai branch is rumored to be located within Nisshin Kisen Kaisha, but this has not been confirmed as it has not yet been established. In addition to the Nisshin Kisen Kaisha's routes on the Yangtze River, the NYK Line's Sino-Japanese connecting lines' Huashan Maru, Songshan Maru, Tangshan Maru, and Lushan Maru, and the Osaka Shosen Kaisha's Fuzhou, Taiwan, and Keelung routes' Changsha Maru and Fujian Maru, among others, will be transferred to the management of the new company. Some of the staff will also be transferred to the new company. The date of realization of the organization is still uncertain.</p>
<p>Capital of 73 Million Yen</p>
<p>The detailed internal organization of the general office of the organization is listed as follows: (1) Name: East Asia Shipping Joint Stock Company; (2) General Office: Tokyo; (3) Capital: 73 million yen; (4) Objectives: A. Engaging in maritime transport between Japan and China, between coastal ports of China, and between China and foreign countries; B. Operating wharves and warehouses; C. Engaging in related businesses and investing in related enterprises.</p>
<p>Eleven Shipping Routes Operated</p>
<p>(5) Eleven shipping routes operated: Between Japan and Tianjin, between Japan and Qingdao, between Japan and Shanghai, between Japan and South China, between Taiwan and Shanghai, between Taiwan and Tianjin, between Taiwan and South China, between Dalian and North China, between Tianjin and Shanghai, between Tianjin and South China, and between Dalian and South China. The Yangtze River is not included. Sixteen branch offices are established, with locations roughly as follows: Tokyo, Yokohama, Osaka, Kobe, Moji, Nagasaki, Taipei, Dalian, Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, and five other locations.</p>
<h3>British Ship Bombed by Japanese Aircraft in Yichang; Britain has Lodged a Protest; Japanese Naval Authorities Deny the Incident; However, it has been Handed over to the Army Authorities for Investigation</h3>
<p>According to the Continental Daily News, Rear Admiral Holt, commander of the British Yangtze Patrol Flotilla, has recently lodged two protests with Vice Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura, commander-in-chief of the Japanese fleet in Chinese waters, against the bombing of the Asiatic Petroleum Company's property and two Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. ships during the Japanese air raid on Yichang on Sunday. It is reported that Nomura has replied that the air raid was not related to Japanese naval aircraft, but the matter is currently being handed over to the army authorities for further investigation. A Japanese naval spokesman also denied bombing Yichang by naval aircraft at a press conference yesterday (the 7th). An army spokesman said that the air raid is currently under investigation by the army authorities and that if the information received here is correct, the bombing of British property and ships was a "most regrettable accident." He had not received official information on the air raid and therefore did not know the details.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Bomb Zhenhai Yesterday; Fire in the City; Details Unknown</h3>
<p>According to a telegram received by a shipping company, Japanese aircraft invaded Zhenhai airspace again yesterday morning (the 8th), dropping six bombs, which immediately caused a fire in the city. Due to the brevity of the telegram, the details are unknown, but it is generally believed that the damage will not be severe, as residents have already evacuated voluntarily.</p>
<p>Shipping Between Shanghai and Zhenhai Not Obstructed</p>
<p>Although there has been shelling by Japanese warships and bombing by Japanese aircraft in the Zhenhai port area in recent days, shipping between Shanghai and Zhenhai has not been obstructed. Outbound ships are operating as usual. The Italian merchant vessel Poli of Yihua Foreign Company returned to Shanghai at 4:00 AM yesterday and is scheduled to arrive in port at 5:00 PM. The German merchant vessel Moufu of Lihe Foreign Company left Zhenhai this morning and is scheduled to arrive in port at 4:00 PM this afternoon, with a return voyage scheduled for the morning of the 12th. Currently, the Hana and Deping are still anchored outside Zhenhai port unloading passengers and cargo and will return to Shanghai one after the other in the coming days.</p>
<p>Ende Approved to Join Shipping</p>
<p>Since the resumption of indirect transportation on the Shanghai-Ningbo route, the Moufu, Deping, Hana, and Poli have been approved by the Ningbo Garrison Command to operate. It has now been learned that the Italian merchant vessel Ende of Zhongyi Company has also been approved to operate and is scheduled to close customs on the 9th of this month and make its first voyage to Ningbo at 4:00 AM on the 10th (Thursday). The ship will dock at the Wa滩 Garden Wharf.</p>
<h3>Shanghai West Guerilla Forces in Contact with Japanese Troops; Opposing Lines Less Than 100 Yards Apart; Clear Gunfire Audible Late at Night</h3>
<p>According to the English-language Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, guerrilla attacks on Japanese garrisons near Xujiahui and Hongqiao are becoming more frequent. Last night (the 7th), a small engagement was heard near the French Concession, with rifle fire lasting for ten minutes. It is estimated that the opposing lines are less than 100 yards apart. Residents of Route Mayne claim that in the past few days, they have heard heavy artillery fire similar to mortars and field guns coming from the west.</p>
<h3>Eurasia Aviation Corporation Resumes Northwest Routes; Southwest Routes Slightly Changed</h3>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's northwest routes were mostly suspended due to the war situation. As the situation in the northwest has stabilized and there are many passengers, the routes have been gradually resumed. The routes flying to the southwestern provinces have always been in operation, but there have been occasional changes. The following is a list of the company's recent flight schedules for the southwest and northwest routes:</p>
<p>Chongqing-Kunming Route: Southbound on Mondays, Fridays, and Saturdays; Northbound on Wednesdays and Fridays.</p>
<p>Chongqing-Guilin Route: Southbound on Thursdays; Northbound on Fridays.</p>
<p>Chongqing-Chengdu Route: Westbound on Fridays; Eastbound on Saturdays.</p>
<p>Chongqing-Xi'an Route: Northbound on Wednesdays; Southbound on Thursdays.</p>
<p>Xi'an-Lanzhou Route: Westbound on Wednesdays; Eastbound on Thursdays.</p>
<p>Chongqing-Guilin-Hong Kong Route: Southbound on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Sundays; Arriving in Chongqing on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.</p>
<p>Chengdu-Xi'an Route: Round trip on Mondays, but the northbound schedule is not yet fixed.</p>
<p>Lanzhou-Xining Route: Round trip on Thursdays.</p>
<p>Lanzhou-Qinghai Route: Round trip every Friday.</p>
<p>Kunming-Hanoi Route: Round trip every Tuesday and Saturday.</p>
<p>Chengdu-Kunming Route: Round trip every Tuesday.</p>
<p>Chengdu-Lanzhou Route: Northbound on Fridays; Southbound on Saturdays.</p>
<p>Lanzhou-Liangzhou Route: Round trip every Friday.</p>
<p>Note: The Chengdu-Lanzhou route is a direct route from Chengdu to Lanzhou. There was no service on this route before, but it has recently been established. The one-way fare is said to be 470 yuan per person. The fares for the other routes remain unchanged from the previous prices.</p>
<h3>Tight Foreign Exchange, Buyers Waiting and Watching; Coal Market Stagnates; All Goods Continue to Rise to 2-3 Yuan; Japanese Coal Competes for Sale, No One Asks</h3>
<p>Due to the repeated tightening of foreign exchange in the black market, the coal market saw all goods skyrocket by 2-3 yuan yesterday. Buyers were at a loss, temporarily suspending purchases, and the entire transaction stagnated. The use of coal briquettes has also decreased. Japanese coal is competing for sale in the market, but few people are interested. The firewood and charcoal industry is collectively discussing uniform prices, but the city is in the summer season, and fuel use is scarce, so there is no impact. The following is a detailed record of the situation:</p>
<p>Coal Market: All Goods Slightly Increased</p>
<p>A reporter from Xinsheng News Agency learned from the coal market yesterday that the market was affected by the repeated tightening of foreign exchange in the black market, which fell to 4 pence, causing the spot market to skyrocket to 2-3 yuan per ton, resulting in market confusion. Buyers were at a loss, and the entire market transaction stagnated, closing early. According to a leader in the industry, the current coal market, except for Indian Kailuan coal, Japanese coal is competing for sale in the market, but few people are interested, and the selling price is relatively low. There are still more than 30,000 tons of Indian coal in stock.</p>
<p>Coal Briquettes and Firewood Charcoal: Uniform Selling Price</p>
<p>The Coal Briquette Industry Association held a committee meeting earlier and collectively discussed uniform selling prices for various coal briquettes. All transactions will be made at the newly set prices starting from August 1st. There are a total of 18 coal briquette factories in the city. The wholesale prices are calculated by the metric ton, with two types: 55 yuan and 54 yuan. As for various types of firewood and charcoal, there is sufficient stock, and there is no significant impact. The industry will sell at uniform prices and will not raise prices further. As it is summer, the use of fuel has decreased, so there is no fear of a fuel shortage.</p>
<h3>Gap in North Jiangxi Road Still Not Closed; Japanese Issue Permits; Population Obviously Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, although a week has passed since the Japanese side sealed off the eastern end of North Jiangxi Road, the shops, households, and alleys have not yet been closed. However, there are still a few Japanese soldiers on guard. Residents who enter and exit do not need permits. After several days of relocation by households or shops, the population has obviously decreased, resulting in streets full of "vacant house for rent" postings, but few people are interested. The Japanese side is still issuing temporary permits to those who remain in the area. From this, it can be inferred that it remains to be seen when the new obstacles will be removed.</p>
<h3>Staff of Miscellaneous Grain Exchange Request a Change in Gate Regulations; Petition the Chinese Ratepayers Association; Request the Issuance of Credentials for Entry and Exit</h3>
<p>Since the French Concession police implemented emergency precautions, all iron gates of the Avenue Edward VII Miscellaneous Grain Exchange have been ordered by the authorities to open at 8:00 AM and close at 11:00 AM, then reopen at 1:30 PM, and close completely at 7:00 PM. The staff and families living within the exchange are concerned that if a fire or emergency occurs, they will be unable to escape due to these regulations. Therefore, they have petitioned the French police and the exchange authorities for a change in the regulations, but without success. Thus, at 10:00 AM yesterday, two representatives were sent to the French Concession Chinese Ratepayers Association with a written petition requesting intervention, or that the authorities issue credentials for entry and exit to protect lives. Secretary Wang Runsheng met with them and promised to consult with the acting chairman and handle the matter impartially.</p>

<h3>The Authorities are Consulting on Measures to Suppress Rice Prices Based on Reports; The Zhexi Grain Sales Organization is Not Yet Sound, and Various Counties are Intercommunicating to Maintain People's Food Supply</h3>
<p>The bean and rice market, consisting of 105 firms, is seeing a recent scarcity of national rice sources, leading to public unease. Speculative rice merchants are taking advantage of the opportunity to become active, devising various schemes to enrich themselves. They frequent the market, engaging in private transactions, causing the black market to become increasingly rampant. People are restless and uneasy, filled with anxiety. Such occurrences are rare in history, resulting in a standstill in overall market transactions, a sluggish market situation, and noisy crowds. Although there is a bustling back-and-forth, everything is just empty talk. Formal transactions have completely disappeared.</p>
<p>Report Indicates the Actual Market Situation</p>
<p>The Public Concession's Bureau of Works and the French Concession's Board of Directors dispatched detectives to set up posts in the rice market, supervising daily and setting price limits for rice, which were strictly enforced. For a time, rice prices fell, but recently, due to hoarding merchants refusing to sell, the market supply has dried up, and black market transactions have proliferated. The order is becoming increasingly chaotic. In addition to closely monitoring black market transactions and rewarding those who report them, the authorities' supervisors have now reported the chaotic market situation to the Rice and Grain Management Committee of the two concessions to devise appropriate measures to suppress the market situation and crack down on black market activities. It is reported that the committee is very concerned about the market situation and has agreed on a major plan to stabilize the rice market and maintain the food supply for the entire city.</p>
<p>Retail Sales Face Difficult Circumstances</p>
<p>Since speculative merchants in the bean and rice market raised prices, members of the Rice Merchants Association have found it difficult to purchase the scarce rice supplies limited to 20 yuan and 16 yuan. Retail departments of rice shops are selling off remaining stock at the limited prices for good rice, but the supply is about to run out. If black market activities are not suppressed, there will be no goods available for sale. Yesterday, prices in the market continued to rise by one yuan or seven to eight jiao. Top-grade white japonica rice exceeded the 25-yuan mark.</p>
<p>Poor Distribution of Grain in Zhexi</p>
<p>The Zhexi Administrative Office previously received reports from various counties stating that panic was increasing daily, requesting prompt relief. The office promptly advanced funds and telegraphed the product sales office to actively find ways to transport and provide relief. According to the reply, the office has purchased a total of 9,818 dan and 4 dou of grain before and after, with 3,687 dan and 2 dou still in storage unsold. However, this grain relief has encountered various difficulties due to the failure of various parties to cooperate. For example, the sales organizations for grain in the war zone counties are mostly unsound, or even non-existent, so the rice transported by this office is not accepted by anyone. Counties with organizations lack capital and are unable to pay cash as required for receiving grain from this office, resulting in poor turnover. Furthermore, the local selling prices set by various counties do not match the market prices at the grain source locations, making it impossible to accept the rice when the price of incoming rice exceeds the local selling price. The original rice in the local area flows out to other places with higher prices. In terms of transportation, there is a shortage of tools and manpower, and the assistance from the county governments is minimal.</p>
<p>Instructing Various Counties to Improve Organizations</p>
<p>These various difficulties cannot be resolved. As a result, the purchased rice cannot be transported out, the transported rice cannot be sold, and the sold rice cannot be cashed out. The administrative office specially instructed various counties that in the future, each county should immediately improve its local rice sales organization, raise funds, and pay cash immediately for the grain purchased on their behalf by the transportation and sales office when it arrives in the county to facilitate turnover. At the same time, local rice prices must not be deliberately suppressed, and refusal to sell is prohibited. As for transportation, civil labor should be hired at any time to actively assist in transportation, so that a steady supply can be ensured. The supply of food rice in the interior is not severely low, but there are difficulties with operating a good plan.</p>
<h3>French Concession Police Sent Detectives to Search Hehe Lane, but Found Nothing</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at six o'clock, the French Police Department dispatched a large number of detectives in trucks to Hehe Lane at the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Route Hua Long, surrounding both the north and south lanes and searching house by house. The search ended around eight o'clock, and it was reported that nothing was found.</p>
<h3>Two Hundred and Fifty Jewish Refugees Arrived and Were Settled in the "Jewish Quarter"</h3>
<p>Two hundred and fifty Jewish refugees from Germany and Austria arrived in port on the Italian postal ship Victoria on the afternoon of the 7th at 4:00 PM. These refugees may be settled in the "Jewish Quarter" in the area of Ward Road and Pingliang Road. It is reported that by the end of this year, the number of Jewish refugees will exceed 10,000.</p>
<h3>European Mail Arrived in Shanghai, One Batch from Vancouver, One Batch from Italy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, two batches of European mail arrived in Shanghai. One batch, from Vancouver, consisted of 400 bags and was transported by the Empress of Russia. The other batch, from Italy, had an unspecified number of bags and was transported by the Vesuvia.</p>
<h3>Severe Market Fluctuations: Foreign Exchange Rates Plummeted Again Yesterday, but it Had No Impact on the Overall Financial Structure; The Government Maintained Extraordinary Stability of the Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Shanghai's financial market is subject to fluctuations due to the machinations of unscrupulous individuals who spread rumors for profit, as the government's authority does not extend there. However, this has no impact on China's wartime financial structure. In areas controlled by the government, foreign exchange rates for the legal tender are exceptionally stable. Imports of necessities are still supplied with foreign exchange as much as possible. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Extraordinary Stability of Legal Tender Foreign Exchange</p>
<p>Since the government has made every effort to stabilize the currency system, the foreign exchange rate of the legal tender in all non-occupied areas under the direct control of the government has been exceptionally stable. The entire financial system remains stable. For the import of essential goods, one can apply to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee for legal foreign exchange. Although it is necessary to pay a balancing fee for the difference between the legal exchange rate and the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, one can still obtain 70% of the required foreign exchange. For the export of major native products, one can receive the legal exchange rate from the foreign exchange settlement bank, along with the difference from the exchange rate quoted by the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. The Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Management Committee continues to equalize foreign exchange as much as possible in non-occupied Shanghai. The established legal prices of foreign exchange in various places remain unchanged.</p>
<p>Special Circumstances in Occupied Areas</p>
<p>The situation in occupied areas such as Shanghai is special. The government's authority does not extend there temporarily, resulting in the interception of customs revenue and expenditures by the Japanese. Japanese goods and luxury goods are imported from the occupied areas. Speculators are manipulating the black market for foreign exchange. The flight of capital from the concessions has caused the black market exchange rate in occupied Shanghai to plummet from 80% to 40%. In fact, the fall in the legal tender exchange rate in the occupied areas has no impact on China's wartime financial structure. The true value of the legal tender remains one shilling two and a half pence and thirty US dollars. The black market exchange rate in Shanghai is not maintained and is allowed to fluctuate naturally to avoid encouraging someone from extracting foreign exchange.</p>
<p>Preventing Escape and Encouraging Internal Migration</p>
<p>To prevent capital from escaping to occupied Shanghai, the interior is working hard to restrict remittances to Shanghai, causing the Shanghai exchange rate to rise in various places. For example, remittances to Shanghai from Chongqing and other places have risen to 1,400 yuan. Remittances are paid in Shanghai and limited to high amounts. However, to encourage the internal transfer of capital, remittances from Shanghai to the interior are exempt from remittance fees, and Shanghai is allowed to pay remittances, while the interior provides full cash. The Domestic Remittance Management Committee, established by the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank of China, handles this. It is reported that a large amount of capital is staying in Shanghai, and various banks and firms have a surplus of capital. They are now considering how to transfer the surplus capital internally.</p>
<p>Legal Tender Credit is Always Solid</p>
<p>China's legal tender policy was successful before the war, and its credit has become even more apparent during the war. As of the end of June this year, the cash reserve for legal tender was still above 44%. All inspections have been in line with the legal ratio. The government has never resorted to paper money policies, and legal tender credit has always been solid. To this day, it is still circulating as usual in the occupied areas. Although someone has repeatedly tried to use their "Lianquan" and "Huaquan" to expel the legal tender, as of now, even in areas under Japanese influence, the Lianquan and Huaquan lack value and are always below the legal tender. All payments are still mainly made in legal tender, and people are still happy to hoard legal tender.</p>
<p>The Financial Market is Fluctuating Severely</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from the financial market yesterday that the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank have denied the incident of ordering 100 million legal tender banknotes from London via telegram. However, the Shanghai financial market remains chaotic due to the manipulation of speculators. Yesterday, HSBC's listed exchange rates fell again, with the British exchange rate down 3.75 pence and the US exchange rate down 7.3125 yuan. As a result, the official transaction prices in the black market broke through the 4-pence mark for the British exchange rate and the 8-yuan mark for the US exchange rate. Speculators continue to aggressively seize opportunities, and the black market price of gold has risen sharply again, closing at 4,050 yuan in the morning and 4,080 yuan in the afternoon. Unified securities fell by 1.3 yuan for type A, and 0.9 yuan for types B, C, D, and E. Remittance discount rose to 210 yuan again.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Investment in Western China Development; The Development Company Raised Funds, Exceeding the Original Amount by One Times</h3>
<p>The Western China Development Company, recently launched by the industrial sector, has raised funds in Shanghai, exceeding the original amount by one times. Various sectors in Chongqing and other provinces in the southwest have also made large investments. The designated development areas include Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Gansu, Xinjiang, Shaanxi, Guizhou, and Xikang provinces. It is reported that the central government will soon promote this development work to facilitate its full realization.</p>
<h3>The Bureau of Works' Publication of Official Gazette Caused Criticism from Western Newspapers; This Year's Publication is Still Issued by the North China Daily News, and Western Newspapers Jointly Filed a Strong Protest</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily News reported that the Public Concession's Bureau of Works recently decided to continue its current arrangement to have the North China Daily News publish the Bureau of Works' official gazette for the 31st consecutive year. The managers of major local newspapers criticized this yesterday (the 7th), and there was a strong reaction. They unanimously believe that the Bureau of Works' arbitrary decision has no legal or moral basis, nor any economic reason.</p>
<p>In Terms of Law</p>
<p>Giving any one newspaper an exclusive priority for matters related to all taxpayers is contrary to the Public Concession's charter. In terms of morality, it shows unfair discrimination against foreign nationals and violates the moral principle of acting fairly. In terms of economics, it uses taxpayer funds without allowing them to see the Bureau of Works' public tender, so the Bureau of Works</p>
<p>Can Contract With The Lowest Price</p>
<p>The Ta Lu Pao, Shanghai Times, Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury, Deutsche Shanghai Zeitung, Russian Slovo, and Japanese Continental News have recently submitted a strongly worded joint appeal to the Bureau of Works, objecting to the long-term discriminatory treatment. They stated that the Bureau of Works' action is extremely unfair and warrants the most careful consideration so that the principle of fair public administration can be restored. The Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury also said that a subcommittee of the Bureau of Works' Economic Committee recently issued a report</p>
<p>Supporting Continued Publication</p>
<p>By the North China Daily News. Six foreign daily newspapers here have filed a strong protest. Because the Bureau of Works is on summer vacation, it has not yet formally responded. The protest was signed by six newspapers, including the Shanghai Times, and submitted to Mr. Phillips, the Secretary-General of the Bureau of Works, on Saturday. Mr. Phillips said yesterday (the 7th) that he was aware of the appeal and would ask the Bureau of Works to pay attention to it after the summer</p>
<p>Vacation Ends</p>
<p>This morning (the 8th), Mr. Phillips said again that the Bureau of Works can only convene a meeting during the summer vacation in the event of special and urgent events. According to the subcommittee's report to the Bureau of Works, urging the continuation of the practice of the North China Daily News publishing the official gazette, the cost is still considered fair. If the equipment is purchased and printed in the prison on Ward Road, it will cost 100,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Special Import Permits for Necessary Supplies; The Ministry of Finance Has Promulgated Eight Measures, and Has Also Promulgated Measures for Export Foreign Exchange Settlement</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Finance promulgated measures prohibiting the import of goods during extraordinary times, it ordered the Director-General of Customs to forward the order to various customs offices to prohibit the import of goods under 18 groups and 230 tax tariff numbers. It is estimated that after the implementation of the above measures, based on the import amount in the 27th year, 23 million yuan in national currency can be saved, equivalent to US$68 million and £13 million. However, because the wartime requirements of</p>
<p>National Defense Supplies</p>
<p>Materials for industry, transportation, etc., still rely heavily on imports, the ministry order with the number "渝資字第八六二號" was specially issued to promulgate eight measures for obtaining import permits for goods prohibited from import during extraordinary times to meet actual needs. If it is for the purpose of adjusting market prices in the rear and supplying special essential uses, and it is approved by a government agency, an</p>
<p>Import Permit Shall Be Issued</p>
<p>After review and approval by the ministry in accordance with the measures. At the same time, to allow export goods to be freely transported and sold, fifteen measures for foreign exchange settlement reporting of export goods were promulgated, attached with a detailed list of restricted goods for export reporting and transshipment, and a table of designated restricted areas for reporting and transshipment of restricted goods. In addition to detailed regulations for foreign exchange settlement reporting, Article 8 also stipulates that merchants</p>
<p>Settle Exchange Amounts</p>
<p>With the national bank, they may obtain from the bank an amount equivalent to the difference between the legal price and the bank's listed exchange rate. All the full texts of the above two measures and attachments will be published in the Industrial and Commercial Information column so that Shanghai merchants can be fully informed.</p>

Training is free for all students.</p>
<h3>Collecting Gold and Silver Nationwide to Replenish Legal Tender Foreign Exchange Reserves; All are Concentrated in Hong Kong and Then Shipped to the UK and the US; Various Provinces are Working Hard to Collect in Accordance with Ministry Orders</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance collected gold and silver nationwide and concentrated it in Hong Kong for shipment to the UK, the US and other countries to replenish the foreign exchange reserves of the legal tender, the US has agreed to purchase a huge amount of silver from China. Therefore, various provinces and cities have received Ministry orders to continue working hard to collect it. The amount of gold and silver exported after the war is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Silver</p>
<p>From September to December of the 26th year, 336,119,039 yuan was exported. In the entire 27th year, 80,330,037 yuan was exported. In the first half of the 28th year, 1,422,081 yuan was exported.</p>

<h3>The Puppet Organization in Nanshi Promotes the Baojia System; Implementation of Drafting Strong Men; Residents are Anxious</h3>
<p>The puppet Nanshi District Office at No. 50 Yisu Lane, Penglai Road, Nanshi, in order to ingratiate itself with its masters and plunder the people, invented the Baojia system in September last year, issued Good Citizen Certificates, and set up a Baojia Office at No. 29 Wanzhu Street in the refugee area, specializing in this matter. Unexpectedly, at the same time, Yu Ying, the puppet police chief, announced the dismantling, ordering citizens to obtain citizen certificates from the nearest sub-bureau. For a time, the masses felt at a loss.</p>
<p>Unable to Bear the Noise</p>
<p>Moreover, those who had already obtained Good Citizen Certificates were being attacked and beaten by Japanese soldiers who tore up their certificates when entering and leaving the docks. This caused an uproar. Soon, the Baojia Office collapsed invisibly. Unexpectedly, recently, the puppet Nanshi District Office has restarted the Baojia system, setting up a registration office at No. 6 Chengd坊, Minli Street, outside the Great South Gate. Zhu Huimin, the chief of the second section of the puppet office, concurrently serves as the head of the Baojia section. The registration of Baojia households has been implemented house by house in various districts since last month. The method is to combine several surnames and families living in one house, or one surname,</p>
<p>With a Larger Population</p>
<p>Those who live alone in a house, that is, one house is taken as a unit, and a household head is selected. One Jia head is selected for every ten households, one Bao head is selected for every ten Jia, and one District head is selected for every ten Bao. Nanshi is divided into several districts, which are uniformly managed by the Baojia section. Each household unit must fill out a printed form in detail, including the name of the household head, family members, residents or employees, age, gender, native place, occupation, address, number of years of residence, religion, relationship between family members and the household head, and the relationship between residents or employees and the household head.</p>
<p>Joint and Several Guarantees</p>
<p>After being filled out, it is reviewed and approved, and then a household registration certificate is issued. Each person is given a certificate to carry with them for passage. At the same time, the puppet Nanshi Police Sub-Bureau has been ordered to stop issuing citizen certificates and household registration certificates. When the Baojia system is completed, these certificates will be invalidated. However, the puppet organization's move is actually to re-investigate the household registration and then implement the drafting of strong men for training, using pacification as a pretext for driving them. Therefore, the residents of Nanshi are all uneasy.</p>

<h3>Pawning and Selling Opium; Detectives Received a Tip and Solved the Case by Disguising Themselves as Buyers</h3>
<p>The Hengfeng Pawnshop at No. 134 Route des Soeurs, is opened by Chen Awu (also known as Desheng) from Chaozhou. In addition to operating the pawnshop business, Chen secretly sells opium. In December last year, the Public Concession Police received a report and went to search, but Chen was well-informed and had already hidden the opium elsewhere, so the detectives were unable to find any incriminating evidence and could not prosecute him. Since then, Chen has</p>
<p>Dared to Act Recklessly</p>
<p>And continued his business. Unexpectedly, recently, Hua Detective Ye Yuxi of the Narcotics Department found out about it and disguised himself as a customer to contact Chen for the purchase of opium. At that time, it was stated that 180 yuan in legal tender would buy 16 liang of opium. The money was to be paid first, and the goods would be delivered later. Detective Ye gave the 180 yuan in legal tender with a secret mark. Then, Chen Zhongshi, a woman from Chaozhou, who is Chen Awu's sister-in-law, delivered the opium to the intersection of Dagu Road and Chongqing Road. The detectives, Li Shugui and Liu Zhaonian,</p>
<p>Arrested Chen</p>
<p>Then Chen led them to the Hengfeng Pawnshop, and they found three large pieces of opium, weighing 164 liang, an opium lamp, an opium pipe, and a pair of scissors with opium stains in various rooms upstairs. They also found 624 yuan in foreign currency. Then, they found the 180 yuan in legal tender with a secret mark in a charcoal basket on the sun deck. Chen Awu, the principal offender, was also taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station. After a while, Lin Guoying, a 21-year-old Chaozhou native,</p>
<p>Who Had Applied to the Police Station</p>
<p>Claimed that the 600-700 yuan in currency belonged to him and had been confiscated by the police. He requested its return. The police suspected that Lin was suspicious and detained him as well. This morning, Chen Zhongshi, Chen Awu, and Lin Guoying were sent to the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, filed a lawsuit in accordance with the law. After the detectives stated everything, the judge, Lun, ordered the three defendants to be detained separately and ordered a second hearing in seven days.</p>
<h3>The Wind of Embezzlement is Rampant; The Results are All Sent to Gambling Dens</h3>
<p>Chu Hongliang (23 years old), a native of Ningbo, had been working as a sales representative at the Xiang Sheng Sock Factory at No. 221 North Zhejiang Road for six months. He was considered quite reliable. Unexpectedly, between April and the 5th of this month, he used a fake seal to collect 562 yuan in private from seven customers, including Jin Xing, Mao Sheng, and Shun Long. He did not return to the factory and spent the money. Until noon the day before yesterday, Hua Police No. 1166 from the Huishi Police Station arrested him on North Zhejiang Road and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court. Li Zhishan, the police lawyer, elaborated on the case and requested an extension for investigation. When questioned, the suspect's confession was vague. (It is reported that the embezzled money was lost in gambling dens such as the Rong Sheng Company in Caojiadu. The largest amount lost in those gambling dens was 10,500 yuan by Qiu Ru, a native of Ningbo, who was recently sentenced to six years in prison.) Judge Jiang Lun ordered him to remain in custody and set another date for verification.</p>
<h3>Case of Robbery of a Detective's Gun; A Runner of an Egg Shop is Detained for Investigation</h3>
<p>A man named Lu Axiang was riding a bicycle to the Fu Tai Egg Shop at No. 285 Ningxing Street at around 3:00 PM the day before yesterday to buy eggs. Because he had an outstanding debt, the egg shop detained his bicycle. The two sides argued and twisted each other to the French Concession Police Station, where they were each fined one yuan and released. Because the egg shop still did not allow Lu Axiang to take the bicycle, Lu filed a report to the police station. Therefore, the police station ordered Detective Wu Wengang to go to the Fu Tai Egg Shop to notify them that debts could not be collected by detaining property. Ni Baosheng (37 years old), a runner from Jiangwan, and others at the egg shop believed that Lu Axiang was leading gangsters to cause trouble, so another argument broke out, and a martial arts drama ensued. As a result, the gun carried by Detective Wu Wengang was also robbed by Ni Baosheng and others. The French Concession Police received the report and ordered Inspector Li Xianyang, Detective Shen Jinshu, Detective Zhang Mucheng, Detective Zhang Hongkui, and many French detectives to rush to the scene and arrest Ni Baosheng, Tang Amao, Yang Sanlang, Qiu Runan, Yang Shangzhen, and the owner of the egg shop, Tong Longhua. They also found Detective Wu Wengang's robbed gun in the egg shop. The police believed that Ni Baosheng and others had obstructed official duties and needed to be investigated in detail. Therefore, yesterday, the six arrested were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, requesting detention for investigation. Judge Qiu Huanxing took the stand to interrogate them. The defendants did not admit to obstructing official duties. The court verified the statements and ordered Ni Baosheng to be detained. Tong Longhua, Tang Amao, and others were each released on bail of 300 yuan. A second hearing was scheduled for the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3>Theft of Copper Wire: Two Receiving Agencies Busted</h3>
<p>The Hong Tai Yuan copper and tin shop at 314 Yaozhu Jiao Road, opened by Yin Jiayuan from Nanjing, had a thriving business and substantial capital. After August 13th, Yin changed his business policy, specializing in buying stolen copper, iron, and copper wire from thieves operating in the Nanshi and Zhabei areas at low prices, melting it down, and selling it to a certain party. As a result, he made considerable profits over the past two years. Recently, on August 1st, the Legal Affairs Office of the French Police received a tip-off and arrested a key suspect who specialized in stealing copper wire. The suspect confessed that the stolen wire over the past two years had all been sold to Yin Jiayuan and Tongxinghao at 276 Beijing Road. Based on the confession, the police dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western detectives on August 8th, successively arresting Yin Jiayuan's wife, Yin Zhou (26 years old, from Nanjing), Sun Peilin (24 years old, from Nanjing), apprentice Wang Xiangzhi (18 years old, from Nanjing), Zhou Mingquan (19 years old, from Danyang), Xiao Rongfu (18 years old, from Zhenjiang), Zhang Dequan (26 years old, from Nanjing), and Pan Xianwen (26 years old, from Nanjing) from 276 Beijing Road, totaling seven people. Over 500 catties of copper wire and other stolen goods were confiscated. The main suspect, Yin Jiayuan, fled upon hearing the news. All the arrested persons and stolen goods were taken to the police station and transferred to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Special Court. The police lawyer presented the case, stating that the defendants were arrested for theft and receiving stolen goods. The investigation was not yet complete, and a request for an extension was made. After the investigating detective Wu Wengang reported the progress of the case, Judge Huang Yan reviewed the documents and ordered a postponement to the morning of August 17th. The defendants were detained.</p>
<h3>Robbery of Banknotes on the Road: Suspect Handed Over to Court Yesterday</h3>
<p>On the morning of the 8th, at 11:00 AM, Song Acai, a clerk from the Zhongfu Bank at 104 Renji Road, was on his way to the General Post Office on North Sichuan Road to withdraw 3,000 yuan in legal tender. While Song was counting the money inside the post office, two burly men were standing nearby. When Song finished counting and wrapped the money in paper to carry it out, the two men followed him. When he reached the intersection of Sichuan Road and Ningbo Road, the men seized the opportunity and snatched the package of banknotes, fleeing the scene. Song chased and shouted, and with the help of a patrolman, a Shandong man named Chen Desheng was apprehended, and the stolen money was recovered on the spot. The other thief escaped. According to the apprehended thief's confession at the police station, his accomplice's name was Sun Degui. Yesterday morning, the police transferred Chen, along with the stolen goods, to the First Special District Local Court for trial. The police lawyer, Jiang Baolian, explained the situation and requested a postponement to investigate the remaining accomplices. Judge Feng then questioned Chen, but Chen was evasive. He hired two lawyers, Fan Gang and Yu Enliang, for his defense. The court stated that the case still required investigation and ordered Chen to be detained for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3>Chauffeur Incites a Crowd to Commit Assault: Six Accomplices Arrested</h3>
<p>Zhang Xiaomao, a chauffeur residing at No. 1 Yuan Shang Li, Dong Zilaihuo Street in the French Concession, a three-story building currently used as the residence of the French Municipal Council's compradore Hu, had a long-standing feud with He Jingqing, who resided on the second floor and worked as an accountant at the Lao Zheng He restaurant on Yunnan Road. On the afternoon of the 5th, Zhang gathered more than ten chauffeurs (both men and women), each carrying clubs, and stormed into He's room, wantonly destroying property and severely injuring He Jingqing, Li Binghan, Xie Dejun, and others. By the time the patrolling police arrived, the assailants had already scattered and fled. The injured were taken to the police station and then transferred to the hospital for treatment. The details have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the French police dispatched Chinese and French detectives to No. 1 Yuan Shang Li and Hu's residence's garage to arrest the suspects. However, the main culprit, Zhang Xiaomao, had already gone into hiding. Only five male and one female accomplice (the female being the wife of another chauffeur from Hu's residence) were apprehended and taken to the police station, awaiting the arrest of the main culprit for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Lawsuit Involving Mother and Son at Jingli Elementary School Implicates the School</h3>
<p>Deliberately Claiming a Biological Son as Adopted</p>
<p>Zhang Fuhua (26 years old), the principal of Jingli Elementary School at Lane 60, Santai Road in this city, was recently sued by his mother, Zhang Ni (56 years old), in the Civil Court of the First Special District, demanding that he be ordered to pay for her support. It is understood that the case will be heard again at 10:00 AM today in the First Civil Court of the First Special Court. Both parties will have a debate. The details are quite complicated. The defendant, Zhang Fuhua, is not an adopted son. It is found that the plaintiff has three daughters and one son, who is the defendant. The eldest daughters are the defendant's sisters. The married daughter is married, and the eldest daughter, who is in her thirties, is still unmarried and lives with the plaintiff in the school. They often discuss matters and stir up the plaintiff, alienating the mother and son, leading to this unfortunate lawsuit. Deliberately claiming the defendant as an adopted son to shake his position as principal. Therefore, there is also another case where lawyer Shen Ronghua sued the defendant in the name of the principal for occupying school property and refusing to hand it over. In reality, the defendant has the dual qualifications of principal and school owner, and no one else has the right to compete for the position of principal. Now, claiming him as an adopted son is intended to slander his position as principal. Furthermore, it is found that the school had debts of several thousand taels of silver before the war, all of which were managed by the defendant after he took office. He has been working hard to run the school until now, and the school's affairs have only just started to develop. However, it is only enough to maintain the school. As for the plaintiff, being his own mother, how could he not take care of her? However, due to financial reasons, he only gives her 25 yuan per month, but he has never stopped. Now, she suddenly wants to double it to 50 yuan, which the defendant cannot afford. As for the plaintiff's claims that the defendant lives an extremely extravagant life, buying chauffeured cars and going to dance halls, these are completely false and can be verified from all sides. Therefore, the court is conducting a detailed investigation of the case outside of the court hearing.</p>
<h3>Refugee Arrested for Theft</h3>
<p>Zhang Fugen (30 years old), a local resident, lived in the Gaochang Temple area. Since the outbreak of the Shanghai war, he sought refuge in the concession, living in a refugee camp with his parents, wife, and children for nearly two years. At 6:00 PM the day before yesterday, Zhang Fugen saw a Ningbo woman named Wang Shao at the corner of Hede Road and Changping Road. She was wearing luxurious clothes, had glasses on her nose, and was carrying a leather bag. Zhang suddenly had malicious intent and snatched her bag from behind, attempting to escape. A guard on duty noticed this and helped to catch him. He was taken to the Gordon Road Police Station along with the stolen goods. Yesterday, he was sent to the First Special Court, requesting detention. The court ordered a postponement for further review.</p>
<h3>Arson Case on Kaizi'er Road Resulting in Multiple Deaths: Arsonist Handed Over to Court Yesterday, Granted Bail of 4,000 Yuan Pending Trial</h3>
<p>No. 6 Renchang Lane, 214 Kaizi'er Road, is a three-story building. The second landlord, Zhang Bingsheng (40 years old, from Huzhou), lives on the ground floor and runs the Happy Forest Film Company, storing many old films in the house. He has fire insurance worth 8,000 yuan. The upper floor is rented to lawyer Zhang Baotang from Fengxian and others. At 4:15 PM on the 5th of this month, the old films stored by Zhang Bingsheng suddenly caught fire. Because the films were made of materials containing rosin and other substances, they were easily flammable. Therefore, the fire spread rapidly and became uncontrollable. Only a tenant surnamed Li from the east side room on the upper floor and the second landlord's entire family escaped. Zhang Baotang's wife, Zhu Surong, daughter, dog, nanny Li Cuiying, and another maid, along with Zhang Chuqing's wife Wang, daughter Xiu'e, Xiao Mao, and nephew Wang Zhongfu, tenants from the west side room on the upper floor, a total of eight people, all died in the fire. The house was completely destroyed, and the fire spread to the landlord's residence at No. 7. Fortunately, the fire brigade was able to extinguish the fire, and the landlord's losses were relatively light. After the incident, the eight burned corpses were examined by the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, who allowed their families to prepare coffins and claim them. The arsonist, Zhang Bingsheng, turned himself in to the French Concession Police, requesting lenient treatment. The French police believed that Zhang Bingsheng had committed crimes of endangering public safety and manslaughter, so yesterday, they escorted Zhang to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, requesting detention for investigation. Judge Miao Qingbang presided over the hearing. The defendant, Zhang Bingsheng, claimed that on the day of the incident, he had left the house for business. When he heard that there was a fire at home, he could not return, so he turned himself in to the police station and requested leniency. The court reviewed the documents and ordered the defendant to pay a deposit of 4,000 yuan to the shop as bail and postponed the hearing to the 14th of this month.</p>
<p>Without Prevention Also, the French-language "Le Journal de Shanghai" reported on the 8th, according to information obtained by this newspaper (the French-language "Le Journal de Shanghai" referring to itself), regarding the Kaizi'er Road fire that resulted in eight deaths, it is said that the Happy Forest Film Depot did not have a license. The municipal authorities should have ordered the implementation of preventive measures to prevent the fire that occurred on the previous Saturday.</p>
<h3>Two Women Attempt Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Yu Zhu, a 21-year-old woman from Ningbo, was attractive and had a basic understanding of literacy. After marrying her husband, she lived at No. 11 Yiyeli, Fulili Road. Initially, they lived in peace, but recently, her husband often did not return home late at night and had extramarital affairs. Yu Zhu felt sorry for herself and became increasingly negative. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, her husband returned home, and they had another argument. Yu Zhu then had suicidal thoughts and secretly took a large dose of medicine. She was sent to the hospital by her family for treatment. Due to the severe poisoning, her life is in danger.</p>
<p>Ge Jiying, a man from Shaoxing in his thirties, worked as a manager at the Tongren Huahang firm in the Hardoon Building. He lived at No. 89 Junyili, Aierjin Road. Six years ago, he married Zhu Shuying, a woman from the same hometown, through a friend's introduction. They had two children. A few days ago, Zhu had a quarrel with her husband over a trivial matter and suddenly had suicidal thoughts, taking raw opium.

<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Volatile and Unstable; Frequent Settlements Created New Low Prices; Chongqing Denies Rumors, Market Slightly Recovered; Japanese Merchants Continued Buying, Resulting in Continued Tightness</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market saw the HSBC official exchange rate sharply decrease by .25 for British gold and .4375 for US dollars, both breaking the lowest prices of .40 and 7.75 from the 21st of last month, reaching unprecedented new lows of 3.75 for British gold and 7.3125 for US dollars. Other currencies also suffered declines. The informal market for British and US currencies was initially soft due to frequent settlements by foreign firms. After 9:30 AM, news suddenly broke that Chongqing had denied rumors of entrusting foreign countries to print 100 million new banknotes, which calmed sentiment slightly. Speculators briefly entered the market, causing the market to ease slightly. Bank buying rates had recovered to 3.9375 for British gold and 7.6875 for US dollars. (After 11:00 AM, Japanese banks suddenly started aggressively buying, and Hong Kong speculators also wired in purchases, tightening the market again. Unprecedentedly tight prices of 3.78125 for British gold and 7.4375 for US dollars briefly appeared. However, British gold was quoted as high as 3.78125, and US dollars were quoted as high as 7.375, but there were only quotes without actual transactions. Later, as the Japanese bank's buying subsided and Hong Kong's buying also stopped, and cotton yarn speculators entered the market, the situation gradually stabilized. As a result, British currency slightly tightened by .03125, and US currency slightly decreased by .0625. Although Chinese merchants absorbed some of the current month's futures, foreign firms were very keen to sell, ultimately causing a slight short squeeze. September futures suddenly started trading, and trading was brisk throughout the day.</p>
<p>HSBC Official Exchange Rates Decreased</p>
<p>Early in the morning, London's major exchange rates, gold prices, and British exchange rates were closed for holidays. New York's silver prices remained unchanged, and exchange rates for US dollars against British pounds and French francs were flat. The official exchange rates of the Central Bank remained unchanged. Banks opened with spot selling prices of 3.90625 for British gold and 7.625 for US dollars, with no changes from the previous closing. After opening, the market softened due to frequent settlements by foreign firms and a lack of interest from foreign sellers. Foreign firms settled spot transactions with HSBC and other foreign banks at 3.875 and 3.8125 for British gold and 7.5 and 7.4375 for US dollars. When the HSBC official exchange rates were announced, British gold decreased by .25 and US dollars decreased by .4375. Other currencies also decreased across the board. The announcement that the silver balance tax would remain exempt had no impact. Subsequently, news suddenly came from Chongqing denying that the Ministry of Finance had entrusted British printers to print new banknotes. As a result, speculators began to sell, and other banks also started selling, causing the situation to ease immediately. Speculators sold spot British gold to Yuli and other foreign firms at 3.875 and 3.90625, and then sold spot US dollars to Netherlands and other foreign firms at 7.5625 and 7.625. At that time, foreign bank buying rates had recovered to 3.9375 for British gold and 7.6875 for US dollars. At around 11:00 AM, Western merchant Sassoon bought September British gold from foreign firms at 3.375. Soon after, Japanese banks suddenly began aggressively buying, and foreign Hong Kong wires also came in to settle, and foreign sellers became less interested, causing the market to tighten again. Japanese banks and Hong Kong wires, along with speculators, successively settled spot British gold from foreign firms, tightening from 3.875 to 3.78125. At the same time, US dollars also softened to 7.375. Near noon, the buying subsided slightly, and the situation turned stable. The bank's spot selling prices at noon were 3.84375 for British gold and 7.46875 for US dollars, tightening by .0625 and softening by .15625 compared to the morning opening.</p>
<p>The Current Month Saw a Short Squeeze</p>
<p>Although Japanese banks continued to buy aggressively in the afternoon, the situation remained stable due to the sudden entry of Chinese cotton yarn speculators and continued interest from foreign sellers, as well as some selling from Hong Kong wires. Japanese banks first settled spot British gold with Datong at 3.84375, and then foreign firms also settled spot British gold with HSBC at 3.84375. Later, HSBC resold spot British gold to cotton yarn speculators and Hong Kong wires at 3.875. After that, a certain bank sold current month US dollars to speculators at 7.3125. Soon after, Yuli also sold current month US dollars to speculators at 7.375. The bank's spot selling prices at the evening closing were 3.875 for British gold and 7.5625 for US dollars, and 3.78125 for current month British gold and 7.375 for US dollars. As a result, spot British currency tightened by .03125, and US currency softened by .0625 compared to the previous day. Current month British currency squeezed long by .03125, and US currency also squeezed long by .0625.</p>

<h3>Authorities Deny Printing New Banknotes; Gold Prices Rose and Then Retreated; Peak Reached 4,130 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash sycee market was still chaotic. Initially, the lingering effects of the previous day persisted, and strong buying continued, with large buyers rushing in. As speculative long positions exacerbated the situation, the opening price at 9:30 AM broke the previous peak of 4,100 yuan from the morning of the 21st of last month, reaching an unprecedented record of 4,130 yuan. Later, Reuters in Chongqing denied the Reuters London dispatch from the previous day that the Ministry of Finance had entrusted British printers to print 100 million yuan in new banknotes. As a result, foreign exchange tightened, causing a selling frenzy, with long positions competing to exit the market. The market suddenly reversed, plunging to a low of 3,970 yuan. Around 11:00 AM, foreign exchange tightened again after aggressive buying by Japanese banks and Hong Kong interests. Therefore, buyers returned to the market, pushing the price back up to 4,100 yuan. At noon, foreign exchange stabilized, causing the noon closing price to fall back to 4,050 yuan. In the afternoon, as foreign exchange became more stable and many outside speculators were eager to exit their long positions, the market price retreated again to 4,000 yuan. The market closed at 4,008 yuan, continuing to increase by 48 yuan compared to the previous day. Trading was extremely brisk, with 1,500 to 1,600 taels changing hands. Silver jewelry also fluctuated unpredictably, briefly reaching an unprecedented high of 415 yuan twice. Ultimately, it increased by 5 yuan. Customs gold and pure Chinese gold remained unchanged, due to the London market being closed for pure British gold.</p>
<p>Sycee Only Increased by 48 Yuan</p>
<p>From the initial opening of each bar (ten taels) in the morning, sentiment was strong, and buying became even more intense as foreign exchange continued to soften. At 9:30 AM, the opening price broke the peak of 4,100 yuan from the morning of the 21st of last month, increasing by 170 yuan compared to the previous closing. Money exchangers conducted transactions for 20 taels at a price of 4,130 yuan, an unprecedented new record. Suddenly, news came from Chongqing denying the reports from the previous few days that the Ministry of Finance had entrusted British printers to print new banknotes. At the same time, foreign exchange tightened, causing the market to weaken. A certain silver firm was eager to sell, plunging the price by 160 yuan. Jewelry stores conducted transactions for 30 taels at a price of 3,970 yuan. At that time, a certain gold shop and money exchangers returned to absorb the supply, and the buying frenzy resumed. The price soon soared by 75 yuan. Money exchangers bought ten taels from jewelry stores at a price of 4,045 yuan. After that, a certain silver firm and a certain jewelry store (acting on behalf of a wealthy individual) continued to sell, causing the price to break back into the 4,000 yuan range. A certain silver firm sold 20 taels to a securities firm at a price of 3,990 yuan. Around 11:00 AM, the foreign exchange market tightened again, which stimulated buying again. Securities firms and money exchangers aggressively absorbed more than one hundred taels, causing the price to soar by 110 yuan. Money exchangers bought 30 taels from a certain gold shop at a price of 4,100 yuan. Near noon, news came that foreign exchange had stopped tightening and was slightly returning, and the price also declined accordingly, falling back by 50 yuan.

Gold shops sold 20 taels to securities firms at a price of 4,045 yuan. At that time, money exchangers aggressively absorbed several dozen taels, raising the price by 20 yuan. Money exchangers bought 30 taels from gold shops at a price of 4,065 yuan. After that, a certain gold shop, acting on behalf of speculative long positions, exited the market, and foreign exchange strengthened, plunging the price by 65 yuan. Gold shops sold 20 taels to a certain silver firm at a price of 4,000 yuan. After that, money exchangers returned to absorb slightly, returning the price by 20 yuan. Money exchangers bought 20 taels from jewelry stores at a price of 4,020 yuan. Later, jewelry stores continued to sell, and the price retreated slightly again. Jewelry stores sold 20 taels to money exchangers at a price of 4,008 yuan, making it the evening closing price. As a result, the price continued to increase by 48 yuan compared to the previous day. It has now increased for four consecutive days, totaling 408 yuan. The daily price range was 160 yuan. The selling price of cash gold from the local brand name was 10 yuan higher compared to sycee. The current standard gold price was 50 yuan lower than the official gold price. It is said that there was little trading in futures.</p>
<p>Jewelry Reached 415 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange rate for silver jewelry was initially quoted at 100 yuan by Datong. At 9:30 AM, the rate suddenly jumped by 15 yuan. After more than ten minutes, it fell back by 5 yuan. At 11:00 AM, it increased again by 5 yuan. At that time, Datong was still quoting 415 yuan, an unprecedented new peak. At 12:10 PM, it fell back slightly by 5 yuan.

The buying price was reduced by around 20 yuan.</p>
<h3>Rediscounting Reached 200 Yuan; Call Loan Rate Returned to .02</h3>

The Money Trade Association's call loan rate has decreased by .02, quoted at .18.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Increased Sharply; US Dollar Bills Decreased Alone</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign currencies saw very strong increases due to tighter foreign exchange and a stronger sycee market. British and US gold pounds were in high demand, and British gold bills were in strong demand, increasing at a brisk pace. US dollar bills were initially quite strong, but the market softened after banks increased supply. The Hong Kong dollar and French franc markets were firm. Singapore dollar and Dutch guilder were in high demand and followed the upward trend. The Canadian dollar market was slightly affected by the weakness of the US dollar bill market, showing a slight decline. The Japanese gold bill market was not very active, and the market was stable, with a rate of 1.09. Demand for Korean bills increased, and they trended slightly higher, with an evening rate of .905. Trading was not brisk at the association. Yongfeng sold and Taijin bought 20 British gold pounds. Qintai sold and Sentai bought 300 US dollar bills, and Xiangfeng sold and Taijin bought 300 US dollar bills. Rentai sold and Jindai bought 600 Hong Kong dollars.

Other currencies did not change.</p>
<h3>Securities: Unified Class A Shares Plunge</h3>
<p>Yesterday's off-market trading of securities continued to decline. The discrepancy between this trend and reality is entirely caused by the major players on the trading floor. There are rumors that groups borrowing stocks to short sell are small and weak, so they resort to inverting black and white, spare no effort to spread negative publicity, the long side is floating and unrealistic, and those who use their ears instead of their eyes are also drawn into the vortex, in order to achieve their profit goals. Generally, buying in at the general price on the trading floor is small, while the groups create false transactions among themselves, making the market price not small from small. Investors are naturally unmoved by this kind of pathological market, but speculators inevitably fall into the dice game. However, it is a fact that there is some mortgage settlement in the market. Yesterday, the market fell as soon as it opened. Speculators took the opportunity to squeeze, and Class C shares broke through 40 yuan. No. 49, Quan Sheng, Lianhe, Hongkang, etc., all sold off. Dingkang, Lemao, Zhenkang, Lianyizhong, and No. 35 all bought in. Class C shares alone had the strongest fluctuations. However, the closing price was higher than the opening price, and most short sellers covered their positions. Large short positions are all watching. Trading was quite lively, and the market price fell by another 9 jiao to 1 yuan 3 jiao. The transaction volume was more than 1 million yuan. A brief table is listed below. (Foreign debts and British Far East stocks are closed for holidays.)</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange were traded at a price of 36 yuan 1 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday's stock market in the Public Industry Exchange was greatly affected by the continued tightening of foreign exchange, and it was very active. Rubber stock trading was the most active. After the market opened in the morning, prices rose steadily, and the prices of many stocks reached new highs. Later, as those who made profits came out, prices slightly declined, but the market sentiment was still firm at the close.</p>
<p>There are many stocks on the market that have not been taken into account, that is, those that do not move with this rising trend, such as the Lipton shares, the Siemens Cloth shares, and the Kalantan shares, while the Chen shares have fallen back to 5 jiao 5 fen. Each company has good internal qualities, but has not been noticed for the time being. This is the only opportunity for investors to buy stocks with funds and hold them for a long time.</p>
<p>Among industrial stocks, Jardine Matheson shares were slightly lower, but Kailan Mining shares rose with the rise in foreign exchange. There was little change in other stocks, and the bond market was weak.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Speculation is Hot, Cotton Yarn Jumps Another 20 Yuan</h3>
<p>The rising trend in the yarn market is very strong, with new highs emerging one after another, and there is a tendency to borrow again and again. Speculative buying is becoming more and more rampant, and there is an image that there is no yarn to buy, which shows the tension of the situation. As for the shouts of the mobile brokers in the market, they are already violent and chaotic. Someone asks for 30 yuan over there, and someone offers 40 yuan over here, and someone drags it away. This kind of scene cannot be described in words. In short, people are panic-stricken to the extreme. Looking at the actual situation, the market is indeed bullish, but such enthusiasm is inevitably beyond the norm, and a reversal should not be prevented. The price of two strands of gold coins is 720 yuan.</p>
<p>The current yarn market is tight and soaring. Because the exchange rate was changed and shrunk the day before, buyers are like springs. The opening price of 20 strands of double horse wharf orders is 608 yuan. After a while, the buying sound was loud and the market rose, one after another, and one addition was as high as 5 yuan to 10 yuan. The operators in the market are like hairpins. In a moment, the price of 20 strands of double horse foreign wharf goods rose from the opening price of 630 yuan to 620 yuan and 5 yuan. After the close, it continued to rise. However, in the afternoon, it was heard that the British exchange rate had slightly eased. The transaction volume for half a day was 1,675 bales, and the transaction volume in the afternoon of the previous day was 530 bales. The market price of 20 strands of double horses rose by 35 yuan, the special gold coins rose by 20 yuan, the five-son lion rose by 20 yuan, and 10 strands of coarse yarn also rose by 20 yuan. Shenxin No. 2 Factory opened 400 bales of 20 strands of fairy, at a price of 590 yuan. The current store orders, today there are 195 bales of cotton yarn to Tianjin, 21 pieces to Yantai, 30 pieces to Xiamen, 60 pieces to Beihai, and 310 pieces to Guangzhou Bay.</p>
<p>The amount purchased by each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 465, Daily Trading 875</p>
<p>Tianjin 200, Mainland 135</p>
<p>Statistics: 1,675 transactions, 530 on the 7th</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market also rose sharply, taking the same steps as our yarn. The opening price of 20 strands of Yueqin for this month was 490 yuan, rising to 96 yuan. It was slightly weak in the middle, falling by 6 yuan. The closing price rebounded by 3 yuan to 492 yuan and 3 yuan. Actual transactions were flat, but people were unanimously bullish.</p>
<h3>Cotton Procurement: Yong'an is Uniquely Strong, Japanese Factories have Shown Decline</h3>
<p>The transaction of Chinese and foreign cotton is still smooth. The Yong'an Factory purchased the most, imported 450 pieces of Tongzhou American cotton packed flowers, with an exchange rate of 133 yuan, and imported 1,500 pieces of Indian cotton coarse and fine raw materials. Other Chinese factories did not have large appetites, and only Yufeng Factory purchased 400 pieces. The reason is that Japanese factories have received a lot of goods for several days. As for the silver funds, they are not able to plan for it for a while. Secondly, most of the goods in the hands of the shops have been sold for more than half, and the funds have become loose. Therefore, there is a temporary rest. The source of Subei has decreased, and only 58 packages of Tonghua have arrived. The current cotton situation is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>Another news is that the transaction of foreign cotton in Shanghai has been expensive recently because most of the hand goods have been absorbed by Japanese factories. Now, because of the tightening of exchange rates, those who have inventories in the same industry have raised prices. The raw materials that can spin 20 strands are asking for more than 150 yuan, which is not known to the factory. It is planned to use the method of reducing labor to remedy the excessive selling price of raw cotton. This method is said to be in the planning, and the transaction of foreign cotton will be hit by then.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market price, New York cotton cloth, early in the morning, the Indian Mumbai telegram number rose first, short sellers covered, speculators took the opportunity to buy, the market price rose because of the purchase of the same industry and short selling continued to cover, but most traders were on the sidelines, waiting for the US government's cotton production estimate report to be released today. At the close, cotton prices were quite firm, 5-6 pounds higher than the previous day. According to estimates of cotton production released today by various industries, it is predicted to be 1,542,000 bales. Yesterday, India's forecast rose by 2 rupees, and Egypt fell by more than 10 pounds.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Colored Cloth and Woolen Cloth Rise Several Times a Day, Dragon Head Fine Cloth Jumps One Yuan</h3>
<p>National Cloth</p>
<p>Foreign exchange continues to tighten, and all kinds of cloth have reached new highs. White goods, coarse cloth, and coarse twill have increased by 3-5 jiao. Fine cloth and fine twill have increased by 1 jiao 3 jiao to 7-8 jiao. Colored cloth and woolen cloth have risen several times a day, and the evening market is especially firm. Very few sellers offer prices. The most transactions are in this street, including more than 500 pieces of fine twill, fine cloth, colored cloth, and woolen cloth. The Hong Kong and Nanyang gangs have traded more than 3,000 pieces of bleached cloth, bleached twill, printed cloth, and ramie yarn, more than 100 bales of fine twill. The Guangdong and Ningbo gangs have added more than 100 boxes of colored twill, blue cloth, and serge. The retail business in this street is declining, and the appetite is weak.</p>
<p>Eastern Piece Goods</p>
<p>New cloth and new twill are in short supply, and the rising trend continues. Dragon head fine cloth jumps by one yuan per piece. The futures price for September has been set at 19 yuan per piece, and the spot price is 18 yuan 5 jiao. The goods for this month are 18 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen. Yanghe fine twill is priced at 16 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, and continues to rise by 5 jiao. Japanese firms have opened more than 400 pieces of trumpet, double fish, dragon head, and other brands of fine cloth for spot futures. The morning market price for dragon head in September opened at 18 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, and continued to open at 19 yuan in the afternoon. Trumpet fine cloth opened from 16 yuan 5 jiao to 17 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen, and double fish fine cloth opened from 16 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen to 17 yuan, with each step becoming tighter. Therefore, the industry predicts that the saying that high-end fine cloth will be sold for 20 yuan per piece may be realized.</p>
<p>Export</p>
<p>On the 9th, 8 pieces of piece goods were exported to Hong Kong, 18 pieces to Xiamen, 6 pieces to Haikou, 80 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 17 pieces to Yantai, 135 pieces to Tianjin, and 20 pieces to Singapore.</p>
<h3>Grain: Rice Transactions Mostly Off-Market</h3>
<p>Du Rice: Although the rice shops in the market mutually persuaded each other to trade within the limit, only the goods that are not restricted and seem to be constrained are slightly opened. However, it is heard that off-market transactions are more lively, and off-market prices are rising again. It is said that if the Gao Hou japonica has opened at around 25 yuan, it will also be at 23-24 yuan sooner or later. Special Nanjing pointed rice is 21 yuan 5 jiao, and Zhongguan Wu pointed rice is 18 yuan 5 jiao. Gao Bi pointed rice also wants 17 yuan. Because it is an off-market transaction, it is impossible for us to investigate. As for those opened in the market, Dongshuang is 22 yuan, Ben Nuo is 25 yuan, and Yang Nuo is 14 yuan. According to the previous price, all have risen by a yuan. According to statistics, the number of transactions inside and outside the market is no less than 10,000 dans, and the source of each road has become increasingly scarce. Only 7-800 packages of No. 7 bus wheels have arrived at Hexia.</p>
<p>Ke Xian: Yesterday's market suddenly showed a chaotic atmosphere. Because the rice shops need to have a greedy stomach after guarding for three days, and although the lifting of the ban has been rumored, it can only be confirmed when the goods arrive. When the japonica pointed rice is rising, Gaojing Xian has raised the price to 21 yuan 5 jiao, and Gao Wu Xian also needs more than 21 yuan. Only a small number of pre-determined rice and brown rice are within the 16 yuan limit. 1,500-1,600 packages were opened in the open and off-market, and the off-market price rose by 6-7 jiao to nearly a yuan.</p>
<p>Yang Rice: There was no formal market yesterday. The new Saigon rice that was previously quoted at 26 yuan 5 jiao was quoted as high as 27 yuan 5 jiao yesterday, and it is said that it is not willing to sell in large quantities.</p>
<h3>Wheat is Expensive, Foot Powder is Actively Sold by the Northern Gang</h3>
<p>The current powder is strong, and retail transactions are active. However, the Beiyang gang's request to sell the whole ticket is still rejected by the factory. As a result, in addition to entertaining the car and boat brand powder of about 20,000 bags, 15,000 bags of red God of Wealth No. 4 powder were also opened, at a price of 5 yuan 9 jiao for exchange. Other local streets and mainland scattered gangs purchased more than 20,000 bags. No. 2 powder is still open at 5 yuan 5 jiao cash. In the midst of the rising price of wheat, the factories' willingness to sell is becoming stronger, and the customers of the big gangs are temporarily restricted.</p>
<p>The rising trend of wheat prices has not stopped. Because the production price has been rising recently, the arrival of goods has been reduced, and the factories need it very much. The hoarders are also releasing prices to absorb, and the brokers are all hoarding. Half of it is due to the rising prices of rice and other goods. The Tongshi is selling Jingzhen Changdan and Pudong wheat with more than 30 cars in succession. It is estimated that Fuxin and Fufeng factories have purchased 13 cars, and the rest are purchased by the local street dealers. The highest price has reached 8 yuan 1 jiao 5 fen, which is another 2-3 jiao higher than the previous day.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Xu Kuizi Offers New Products</h3>
<p>The black melon seeds are now in the transitional period between the old and the new. It is found that Xu Kuizi saw the new products the earliest. It is now known that a small number of them have arrived in Shanghai, with a total of only 6 packages. The big ones are today, you can see the samples, and the first plate will definitely be higher.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a tightening of foreign exchange again, and the exchange rate was increased again, so the market continued to trend upwards. According to the Dutch telegram, the recovery price for September is 6.50 Dutch shields. The current price of 24 coarse white spot is 8 jiao 5 fen, 30 yuan and 5 jiao for this wharf, 34 yuan and 3 jiao for the foreign wharf, 8 jiao for transit goods, and a total of 500 packages were transacted at 26 yuan. Taikoo carriage white rose by a yuan, B mark on the west wharf 39 yuan and 6 jiao 100 packages, east 39 yuan and 4-5 jiao, a total of 400 packages, CW mark on the west wharf 39 yuan and 3 jiao, CX mark 39 yuan, DY mark 38 yuan and 7 jiao east wharf 5 jiao, HX mark 38 yuan and 3 jiao west wharf 5 jiao, H mark carriage red 23 yuan 5 jiao, Dutch red spot rose by 9 jiao to 29 yuan and 4 jiao, transit rose by 6 jiao to 22 yuan and 6 jiao, this cotton white rose by a yuan and a half, Zhenji No. 1 is 35 yuan, No. 2 is 34 yuan and a half, No. 3 is 34 yuan, No. 4 is 33 yuan and a half, domestic sugar is also trending firm, Huizhou white high goods opened to 41 yuan, and it was decided to be 40 yuan to 39 yuan and a half. 39 yuan and 38 yuan 4 jiao, a total of more than 600 packages were transacted.</p>
<h3>Oil Cake: Soybean Oil Situation Turns Stable</h3>
<p>Soybean oil has been manipulated by powerful people, and the price has moved towards a high point. However, the rising trend has turned stable yesterday. Because the transactions in the past three days have mostly been speculative hoarding, the actual sales have been on the sidelines. Yesterday, only 70 barrels of Dalian barrel oil were opened, at 50 yuan, and 150 barrels of Kobe barrel oil were opened, at 50 yuan and 8 jiao, 50 pieces of Jiaozhou oil were opened, at 36 yuan and 3 jiao, and 1,000 cans of Tianjin canned oil were opened, at 47 yuan and 3 jiao to 48 yuan.</p>

<h3>Transferring Diojao Fees to Relieve Refugees</h3>
<p>— (New Dream)</p>
<p>Now in Shanghai, everything has to catch the early market. It is still two months until the Mid-Autumn Festival, but mooncakes have already been found on the market. Not only is eating catching the early market, but even Diojao is catching the early market. The lunar July has not yet begun, but some people in the city have already launched Diojao.</p>
<p>Shanghai's Diojao is based on alleys as units. In each alley or street, someone launches a decision to fight for a Taiping Gong Diojao. Perhaps there are even wealthier families who fight a decision to fight for Diojao alone. In addition to inviting monks or Taoists to chant scriptures, you also have to buy tin foil, paper figures, paper objects, and everything else. It costs at least tens of yuan to fight for Diojao for a day, or even more than 100 yuan. There are also hundreds of yuan, depending on the size of the scale. The entire Shanghai has countless alleys. For Diojao, a large amount of consumption is quite alarming.</p>
<p>In Chinese customs, July is a season for ghosts, just like Qingming. For the sake of ghosts, I don't know how much money will be spent. For the sake of Diojao, monks and Taoists are embarking on a lucky journey, too busy to cope. Each temple or lower courtyard, etc., does not know how much money it will earn in July. At the same time, in paper shops, each family is busy making paper gods, paper ghosts, and other Diojao things. It is said that no matter which paper shop, the business done in July is more than the combined total of the other eleven months of the year. Therefore, the Daoban people, after a year has begun, hope for this Diojao month in July.</p>
<p>Probably the so-called public Diojao, etc., are initiated by those who watch the alleys, playboys, etc. For one or a combination of several alleys, money is donated from house to house. Unless they are believers, ordinary families will generously take out Diojao donations of a few jiao or even one or two yuan every year, without any stinginess. Although there is a reimbursement account written on yellow paper afterwards and posted in a place where everyone can see it, the initiator is also able to scrape a lot of oil from it. Everyone knows what the purpose of these people initiating Diojao is, unless they are fools.</p>
<p>Since Diojao is a superstition, especially when the standard of living is high to the sky, this huge consumption seems to be avoidable. The call for frugality has been resounding like thunder. If this Diojao fee cannot be saved, then there is no need to discuss other consumption. Therefore, as the Diojao season is about to begin, Mr. Jin Zongcheng, the manager of the New New Company, advocates transferring the Diojao fee to relieve refugees. Following this, the city's Relief and Disaster Relief Committee also appealed to all sectors of society to stop fighting Diojao and use the Diojao expenses to relieve refugees.</p>
<p>Indeed, if the money spent by all the people in Shanghai for Diojao is used to relieve refugees, it can save many refugees, which is much more practical than spending money on ghosts and gods in vain. Therefore, the author sincerely hopes that urban residents will use the money for Diojao to save refugees. This will not only eliminate old customs, but also allow refugees to be relieved. What could be more delightful?</p>
<h3>After the Rain, a Clear Sky</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Thousands of Families of Fireworks, Rural Cooperation, Thousands of Miles of Waves, Prayers, Flying Overseas</p>
<p>There is one more thing: please ask my father to appoint a general manager from among the shareholders. A snake cannot move without a head. With a general manager, everything can be done according to the order. These few things were all decided after they returned to Anle Town from the Free Village and wrote to their father. It is pitiful that these two sisters discussed until midnight every day in Dr. Zhang's house. Originally, people in Dr. Zhang's house get up very early and go to bed very early at night. When it came to the ten o'clock chain at night, almost everyone in the house turned off the lights and went to sleep. But Chu Zhu's lover said to them: "We have to get up early tomorrow morning to go to the hospital, so we have to go to bed early. But you don't have to get up as soon as it dawns tomorrow. You don't have to be bound by this. If you want to discuss something or draft something harmful, feel free to do so. Moreover, it is more peaceful at night, and it is most suitable to write something at night. You know me, I like to write things at night the most. But now there is no way, but you don't have to be bound by us going to bed early. You can stay up all night if you want." But although the lover said so, they were afraid of disturbing others, and even spoke in a low voice, not daring to speak loudly. The lover knew this, and specially prepared some dry snacks or the best biscuits for them. If not, they asked the kitchen to cook chicken porridge for them, knowing that they Cantonese people like to eat late-night snacks. However, she herself slept her own sleep and would not accompany them. Who knew that on Wednesday, the two Miss He received a telegram from their father from Beiping. The telegram said: "Father is ordered by the International Trade Council and will be traveling to Xinjiang soon. Please forward the telegram to mother and brother. Regarding the silk weaving factory, the shareholders want the two children to be fully responsible and intend to appoint Shuang'er as manager and Bian'er as engineer. Before starting the business, Li can fly to Europe and the United States for inspection, for a period of one month. Please also handle the construction of factory buildings and other matters. Uncle Jiang Jing will return to the South and arrive in Shanghai on Monday, staying at the International Hotel. He is also one of the shareholders and has experience in running silk weaving factories. You can visit him, and the funds will also be remitted by him." The two Miss He were naturally satisfied with such a telegram from their father. But everything has to be busy, and it is still necessary to teach Shuangyu to be the manager. Shuangyu said: "I can't do this. We are newcomers and have no experience at all. How can we be managers?" Liyu wanted to comfort her and said: "Don't worry! Anyway, Uncle Jiang is coming to Shanghai. He has been the manager of a certain silk weaving company. We can ask him to take the position." It is true:</p>
<p>Just intending to go on a long journey together, suddenly hearing the news that the returning geese are here. (168)</p>
<h3>Do Not Buy Rice Above the Price Limit</h3>
<p>— Nan</p>
<p>The prices in Shanghai have recently taken off, and the cost of living has at least doubled, making it extremely difficult for the general salaried class, who calculate where to save and where to save every day, but still find it difficult to make ends meet.</p>
<p>Recently, the concession authorities have limited the price of rice to a maximum of 20 yuan per dan, and have adopted strict measures to effectively maintain this price limit. This regulation is for the benefit of the public, and we should work harder to help implement it. However, violations have recently been discovered.</p>
<p>Yesterday, a friend bought a dan of rice, and the price was 20 yuan and 4 jiao, but the invoice showed 20 yuan. I felt very strange and asked my friend why he was obviously losing out? His wife said: "In this way, the weight can be more sufficient, and the quality of the rice can be better." Later, after asking several families, most of them had the same situation.</p>
<p>In this kind of under-the-table transaction, the buyer may think that he is not losing out, or that he can even get a little cheaper, but its impact is very large. Because this kind of under-the-table transaction exists, it will definitely rise slowly, and eventually the current price limit will not be able to be maintained, causing everyone to suffer. We should unanimously and firmly refuse to buy rice above the price limit, and not give merchants the opportunity to profit for the sake of a little personal gain; and if there are stores that raise rice prices, we should immediately report them and let them be sanctioned by the public.</p>
<p>At the same time, I hope that the rice merchants in the concession will not do things that are unconscionable, betray their compatriots, and betray the country for the sake of a small profit.</p>
<h3>Regarding the 400,000 Yuan Stamps</h3>
<p>(1) Hope to Recover as Much as Possible According to the Old Banknote Example</p>
<p>After reading "400,000 Yuan Stamps," I feel that this issue does need to be discussed. According to the results of my conversation with several cigarette exchange shops today, the listed exchange rate has actually increased from 1 yuan to 110 points, 120 points, and has been raised to 130 points and 140 points. However, there is a greater difficulty in this bidding. Those who list 110 points and 120 points are of course taking in too many stamps and are sacrificing them to absorb legal tender. Those who list 130 points and 140 points are sacrificing so much that it is almost one-third strong. The profits of the cigarette exchange shops are indeed generous, but they will not be higher than 30%. Under such a sacrifice, it is inevitable that they will suffer extremely large losses in their operations. However, they still grit their teeth and sacrifice. Since stamps have been used to replace fen coins, it is inevitable that they will be damaged, stained, and degummed due to repeated transmission. At this time, the postal bureau is issuing notices prohibiting the use of damaged stamps and prohibiting the use of fragmented stamps for sending letters to other places and registered letters. Now that fen coins are about to be shipped to Shanghai, these damaged stamps will naturally not be worth half a penny in hand. Therefore, rather than suffering a greater loss of total annihilation in the future, it is better to get rid of them as soon as possible. Those who exchange 1 yuan for 130 points and 140 points are all these damaged one-fen stamps.</p>
<p>400,000 yuan—how will this huge amount be disposed of after the issuance of fen coins?</p>
<p>The post office is a state agency. First, we naturally ask to recover as much as possible according to the old banknote example. If it is indeed impossible, then we hope to accept the second request:</p>
<p>That the two notices, "Prohibiting the Use of Damaged Stamps" and "Prohibiting the Use of Fragmented Stamps for Sending Letters to Other Places and Registered Letters," can be temporarily suspended or have an appropriate time limit.</p>
<p>This is our minimum expectation. It would be even better if the authorities could have a more comprehensive approach. — (Su Chen)</p>
<p>(2) Hope that Various Groups and Organizations Will Contribute Methods</p>
<p>After reading Mr. Xin Meng's "400,000 Yuan Stamps," I believe that this issue urgently needs a proper solution so that this matter can be resolved reasonably. Then, not only will the general peddlers and merchants benefit a lot, but it can also eliminate many disputes caused by stamps in society.</p>
<p>I first propose to request the Shanghai Postal Authority to immediately recover the stamps circulating in the city, regardless of damage or disrepair, within a time limit after the central fen coins are issued. The procedures and methods should be formulated in detail separately.</p>
<p>I also hope that before the central fen coins arrive in Shanghai, the postal authorities should first issue an announcement to reassure the public and avoid the chaos in the market during the transition period. This is a matter of vital interest to the 5 million citizens of the city. I hope the wise postal authorities will pay close attention.</p>
<p>The above two points may also be a unanimous request from the citizens of Shanghai. I hope that enthusiastic and powerful people from all walks of life, as well as groups and organizations such as the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Taxpayer Chinese Association, will provide as many high opinions and contribute methods as possible, and immediately contact the postal authorities to resolve this serious problem as soon as possible, which will greatly benefit the common people. — (Jue Fen)</p>
<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>The total amount of the May issue's charity sale contribution fee is 27 yuan and 9 jiao. The detailed list has been published in this issue on June 25. For the sake of saving procedures, the total amount (the detailed lists of each issue have been published separately) will be sent to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications in conjunction with Ziyoutan, the entertainment industry, children, and clothing, food, housing, and transportation. The receipts No. 400 and No. 402 of the Bank of China and the remittance number No. 31 of the Bank of Communications Yu Tiao have been drawn, and are now stored in the editorial office. This is a public announcement.</p>
<p>In addition, next to the advertising of the Jingcheng Grand Theater in this month's issue, there is a text similar to the text layout format of this publication, describing "poverty," which is also an advertisement and not a manuscript from this publication. This is a special statement. Chunqiu Editorial Office</p>
<h3>Does the Soul Really Exist? (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhu</p>
<p>(1) Things unseen do exist! If you say that what is unseen is nonexistent, then aside from a few specialists, most of us have never seen air and electricity. However, we know they exist by observing their actions! A former atheist once said, "I have performed many surgeries, and I have never seen a soul in the human body." At that time, a Christian asked him, "Doctor, do you love your wife?" The doctor replied, "Of course, I love her." The Christian said, "Please show me your love." The doctor was left speechless. Ladies and gentlemen, since you know that love exists even though it is unseen, and emotions exist, the soul is the same. Although it cannot be seen, it certainly exists. (2) The human form is different from that of birds and beasts! The forms of birds and beasts are turned away from the sun and moon, their heads toward the ground, with no hope beyond finding food on the ground. This is because they have no soul, and death is the end. However, we humans are very different from birds and beasts. Therefore, the human form has its head toward the sun and moon, face toward the sky, not solely seeking earthly food as satisfaction. We also seek eternal heavenly blessings for the soul! Earthly possessions can never satisfy your and my hearts. Unfortunately, many people in modern times are misled by materialism, believing that worldly pleasures are enough! They no longer pursue the eternal comfort, hope, peace, joy, vitality, and heavenly blessings of the spirit. Such people pride themselves on being successful, but their conscience is damaged; they are pitiful people, not much different from birds and beasts. I hope dear readers will not repeat their mistakes, but find a way out for the soul.</p>

<h3>Once a Year　Double Seventh Festival　"A Match Across the Milky Way" Performed</h3>
<p>— Yan Yan</p>
<p>Celestial World and Mortal Realm　Cowherd and Weaver Girl</p>
<p>(Beiping Theater News) During every auspicious festival, the Peking opera world customarily presents plays appropriate to the occasion. The "Match Across the Milky Way" on the Double Seventh Festival is one of these. With this year's Double Seventh Festival approaching, theaters across Beiping will stage this play to add to the festive atmosphere. It is expected that this year's "Match Across the Milky Way" will be grander than in previous years. Based on what I have heard, the reports are as follows:</p>
<p>Xun Huisheng: After a month-long summer break, he is scheduled to appear on stage on the Double Seventh Festival. He will perform "Match Across the Milky Way" at the Jixiang Theater that evening. The following evening, he will also perform this play at the Chang'an Theater to celebrate the festival. Xun will play the Weaver Girl, and Jin Zhong will play the Cowherd.</p>
<p>Shang Xiaoyun: She performs "Match Across the Milky Way" every Double Seventh Festival. It is expected that she will perform it at least three times this year. Shang himself will play the Weaver Girl, and Shang Fuxia will play the Cowherd.</p>
<p>Xiao Cuihua: This year, she plans to cross-dress as the Cowherd and is actively preparing for it. The role of the Weaver Girl has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>Huang Yulin: After a month-long summer break, he is scheduled to appear on stage at the Chang'an Theater before the Double Seventh Festival, performing "Match Across the Milky Way." He will play the Weaver Girl himself, or Zhou Weijun will play the Cowherd.</p>
<p>Mao Shilai: He is also scheduled to perform "Match Across the Milky Way" during the day on the Double Seventh Festival, playing the Weaver Girl himself, with Chen Shengtai playing the Cowherd.</p>
<p>Zhao Jinrong: After a recent summer break, she will perform "Match Across the Milky Way" at the Xulan Garden, completely in the style of Mei Lanfang. The performance date has not yet been determined. Jinrong will play the Weaver Girl, or Jiang Miaoxiang will play the Weaver Girl.</p>
<p>Zhao Xiaolan: This year, he has also decided to cross-dress as the Cowherd, with the painted-face Li Chunheng cross-dressing as the Weaver Girl. A double cross-dressing performance is expected to be even more sensational than Xiao Cuihua's.</p>
<p>Li Wanchun: As is customary every year, he will perform "Match Across the Milky Way" several times. It seems to have been decided that he will perform at the Qingle Theater on the evening of the Double Seventh Festival. Wanchun will play the Cowherd himself, and Gu Yulan will take on the role of the Weaver Girl.</p>
<p>Fu Liancheng Society: This year, the role of the Weaver Girl has been decided and will still be played by Liu Wutong. The role of the Cowherd has not yet been determined. It is expected that this play will be performed more than five times this year.</p>
<p>Drama School: Four people are planned for both the Cowherd and Weaver Girl roles, including Yuan Jinkai, Tan Jinhui, Zhao Jinnian, and Li Yuru (cross-dressing) playing the Cowherd, and Bai Yuwei, Li Yuru, Li Jinhong, and Zhao Jinnian (cross-dressing) playing the Weaver Girl. It is expected that it will also be performed more than five times.</p>
<p>Rongchun Society: This year, various lantern decorations and building blocks have new designs. The roles have mostly been decided, but the final decision is still pending. The number of performances will likely be the highest among all troupes, possibly exceeding ten times.</p>
<p>In addition, troupes such as Xu Dongming, Li Yanxiu, Hua Huishi, Xu Yanhua, Xu Wen, Lü Ranxiang, Liang Yunqiu, and Xian Ruifang also have plans to perform "Match Across the Milky Way." As for Cheng Yanqiu, he never performs this play, so it is unlikely that he will make an exception this year. Troupes such as Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Xi Xiaobo, Sun Yukun, Liu Zongyang, and Ma Yunqiao are either laosheng troupes or wusheng troupes and do not perform "Match Across the Milky Way."</p>

<h3>Johnny Weissmuller Returns to the Screen</h3>
<p>— Fengxiang</p>
<p>MGM Signs a Seven-Year Contract　"Chinese Tarzan" to Compete for Popularity</p>
<p>The story of "Tarzan of the Apes" has long been a household name, but "Tarzan" only appeared on the screen in 1918. Elmo Lincoln was the first to take on this important role. In subsequent remakes, the role has been played by about twelve different actors, but only four have made a lasting impression on audiences. These four are Johnny Weissmuller, Buster Crabbe, Herman Brix, and Glenn Morris. Among them, Weissmuller, who won the swimming championship at the World Games, is the most famous.</p>
<p>Weissmuller had previously made many "Tarzan of the Apes" films for MGM in Hollywood, such as "Tarzan the Ape Man" in 1932, "Tarzan and His Mate" in 1934, and "Tarzan Escapes" in 1936. Recently, MGM signed a new seven-year long-term contract with him, and it has been decided that he will return to Hollywood immediately after completing his swimming program at the World's Fair on October 31 this year to shoot the new film "Tarzan in Exile." Fans must be delighted by this news.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was news from Hong Kong that our Chinese strongman Peng Fei would be filming "Chinese Tarzan" and had once come to Shanghai to invite the actress Li Hong to co-star. However, because Li Hong had contractual obligations and could not spare the time, it had to be abandoned, and Li Zhuolai was invited to play the main role instead. At that time, it may be worth seeing the "Chinese Tarzan" and "Foreign Tarzan" compete for popularity on the screen.</p>
<h3>Molière and "The School for Wives"</h3>
<p>— Zhe</p>
<p>In the past six months, Molière's plays have been very popular in Shanghai: in mid-March, the Sino-French Drama School performed "Les Précieuses Ridicules," and not long ago, the Hujiang Literary Society and the New Drama Society performed "Tartuffe." From this point of view, Molière's comedies are being welcomed by the general audience. The reason they like Molière's works is that Molière's comedies are a representation of social reality and a proactive exposure of it.</p>
<p>Molière was a great French comedian of the seventeenth century, and his position in French drama is just like Shakespeare's in England. Molière's works have a high degree of timelessness, full of vitality, and can attract countless audiences in any corner of the world. Molière produced his comedies with a serious attitude, and what he expressed were the weaknesses of society and the shortcomings of humanity in his time. He selected common types from the surrounding life to create the characters in his comedies. The humor in Molière's comedies is not simply emotional but objectively and rationally funny.</p>
<p>"The School for Wives" is Molière's work from 1662, originally named "L'École des Femmes." It has now been adapted into a three-act Chinese play by Mr. Sun Zhang. The content is roughly like this: Mr. Arnolphe is a gilded man and someone who has stumbled countless times in the whirlpool of love. Marriages and divorces in Europe and America, as well as the kind of unions that value love but not chastity, make him afraid to try easily. In addition, he has always been defeated in the field of love, which inevitably makes him feel apprehensive about marriage.</p>
<p>But he is over forty years old, and after being well-fed and warm, he finally thinks about marriage again. Therefore, because he wants to marry but is dissatisfied with the women of the present, he has no choice but to turn his thoughts and create a so-called "ideal" "wife" to achieve his surreal "ideal." Sure enough, according to his foolish theory, he sought out a naive, unspoiled girl from a poor rural woman in Wuxi and placed her in a small nunnery for a slave education.</p>
<p>As a result, when he returned after going to Wuxi for ten days, the situation had changed. The girl was madly in love with the son of his friend Zhen Qing. Later, many unexpected relationships were discovered, and finally, by a twist of fate, they entered into a happy marriage. As for Mr. Arnolphe, since he looks down on women, is not at ease with women, and is afraid of women, well, he can only remain a widower for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>When Molière performed "The School for Wives" in 1662, the audience could not appreciate the advantages of the play and received many random criticisms, especially from noble women, who felt that the story was deliberately insulting them. Molière was angered by their bad reviews, so he wrote another play, "La Critique de l'École des Femmes," which premiered in 1663 and was unexpectedly welcomed by society. However, at that time, a Duke of La Feuillade thought that a certain character in the play was referring to him, so he was greatly angered and tried to retaliate. Finally, one day, Molière suffered a great insult when the Duke of La Feuillade rubbed his face with a copper button until it bled. Although this is an anecdote in Molière's theatrical history, it also shows Molière's intolerance of society and his indomitable spirit of exposure.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: The Sino-French Drama Society's next performance after "The Wilderness" is "The School for Wives," directed by Shu Yan. The play has already been rehearsed, but according to the news received yesterday, it may be changed. What play will be performed instead is unknown and will be reported later.)</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>At the break of dawn, the staff guides the performer to the pre-arranged location, meets with those who are enticing the performer away, gets into a sedan car, lowers the curtain, and the driver cracks the whip. In less than half an hour, they have traveled dozens of miles. By the time the theater owner discovers this, it is impossible to track them down. Once these people arrive at their destination, the person who enticed the performer away will certainly receive a special reward. At the same time, when the whole city hears that a certain performer has been enticed from a certain theater, it is simply considered an amazing event. Once they appear on stage, they are bound to cause a sensation. The audience always feels that the performer's skills must be a hundred times better than those who joined the troupe on their own. This has become a habit. Even if a performer joins on their own later, the theater owner will also announce that the performer was enticed from somewhere. This has become so common that the term "enticing performers" was a very popular phrase in inland theaters in the past. Nowadays, with convenient transportation, famous performers all have their own costumes. Secretly enticing performers has changed to publicly inviting them. Advertisements are placed in the newspapers in advance, and after an agreement is reached, a special person is sent to pick them up. On the day of departure, dozens of trunks of costumes are transported, accompanied by several supporting actors and more than a dozen attendants, creating a grand and imposing scene like an army setting out, fearing that not enough people know about it. Compared to the past, when famous performers carried small bundles on their backs, secretly rode in mule carts at night, and eloped with the person who enticed them away, there is a vast difference. The changes between now and then are amazing, but the difference in the hardships and joys of the performers is also very great. I hope that today's famous performers will not be too arrogant, so that the former performers will not feel resentful.</p>
