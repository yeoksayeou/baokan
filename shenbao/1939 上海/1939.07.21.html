<h3>英內閣考慮　擴大對華貸款　因中國國幣滙價又跌　將提高平準基金數額</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英內閣因中國國幣匯價又跌、故正考慮將英國貸與中國充平準基金之五百萬鎊、擴大至一千萬鎊、據此間金融專家言、英國對於中國國幣若不繼績支持、則日本在華北與長江流域方面之繼續壟斷、卽將大見順利、惟英日在東京談判之際、中國國幣發生此種情形、頗使英國爲難、（十九日美聯社電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）外務决官勃特勒昨在下院宣稱、關於解決英日間各項懸案、以及英國對日採取經濟報復手段問題、其關鍵全在日本、（二十日海通電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）內閣於本日舉行每週例會時、曾將駐日大使克萊琪與日本有田外相在東京談判情形、提付討論、消息靈通者對此、旣未表示樂觀、亦無悲觀之狀、大部份人士均謂、談判甫經開始、結果如何、尙難逆視云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>英日東京談判</h3>
<p>關於天津事件的英日東京談判，本月十五日英駐日大使克萊琪與日外相有田，曾舉行第一决的談話，其內容並未宣佈，僅稱雙方各自聲明立塲。日砟束京電訊，他們又已於十九日晨起，舉行第二决談話。據一般人的觀察：目前英日雙方所討論的，當爲談判的範圍問題。就英日兩國的輿論看來，英國祇希望把日本封鎖天津英租界事件，當作地方問題，討論一個解決的辦法，企圖以中立地位來保全在天津的一切權益，所以她祇提出引渡刺程四嫌疑犯和改善租界行政問題爲談判的據點。而日本却希望從這决談判中，解決英日在華的一切糾紛；要求英國承認日本所造成的遠束新事態；換句話說，就不啻要求英國承認日本對中國已經戰勝了；勝利已經確定了，同時確已戰勝了英國，央國應將在華的權益放棄了。雙方的目的，眞可以說是南轅北轍！</p>
<p>舉一個例：甲說我要收買基地，乙說我想修理房屋，這兩方根本上所謂不是生意經，那得成交；但是甲乙居然捉對兒寒暄，打算開口講價，豈非笑話？英日所要解決的，並非同一問題；所謂談判的範圍尙未確定，其實是談判的問題尙未確定；然則談判些什麼？居然談判開始了，這也是笑話。笑話儘是開展，却也有人別具會心；初傳柬京談判的時候，德義與日本都稱牠爲遠東的慕尼黑會議，暗示英國必將有所讓步；如是說法，暴露了他們的奢望；也因爲英國在日本武力封鎖的壓迫下，不採取有效的抵抗辦法，反要求日本舉行和平的談判，實際上便已有了很大的讓步。</p>
<p>不過這決不能認爲是英國對於遠東政策的改變；英國的遠東政策，乃是她的國策的一部分。任何一個國家祗要具有獨立的國格，她的國策就決不會因他國的干涉而有所改變。英國之不會因日本種種侮辱壓迫攻擊而遽改變她的國策，也正如同中國這决的抗戰，爲着國家獨立的國格，而不願意在他國壓迫下改變自已的國策一樣。這只看英國政府曾經再决的這樣聲明，便可令人相信英國目前雖在艱難形勢之下，也終不會變更她的遠東政策的。</p>
<p>並且就現實的利害關係來說，英國也沒有改變遠東政策的可能；這决日本的對華作戰，軍事上的目標是中國，而經濟上英國也是她的目標之一。在中國的工礦業中，有不少英國的投資；中國的航業，大部分是屬於英國商民；中国的对外贸易，也以英国和起所屬殖民地為最多。英國如果成人日本的所謂「遠東新事態」，就必須放棄這些在華的權益；甚至英國爲滿足日本完成大陸政策的慾望起見，必須撒退在遠東各地的勢力。最近廣州曾發生收回九龍的反英運動，香港也發現過鼓動印人排英的傳單。英國在華的權益不能保全，遠東其他各地的勢力，恐怕也就難以維持。這不僅是一個有關英帝國威望的問題。</p>
<p>日本在這决的談判中，形勢上是處於較優的地位。不僅她的國內和中國淪陷區域的反英運動，表示日本的機能；而且日本對於英國在個淪陷區域的經濟活動，完全加以禁絕，對於各地的租界，有形和無形的加以封鎖，這更是希望英方讓步的一種信號。日本隊英國所提出的「承認遠東新事態」的要求，若只就每一局部而論，確有採取強硬態度的可能；但是日本的真正用意，未必奢望能夠完全達到目的：而所以提出過分的要求，恐怕只是綁票式的討價還價政策。她要求英國承認日本一手造成的遠東新事態，乃是一個極大的討價；只要英國肯讓出一寸，便是日本取得進步一尺的基礎，日本也肯暫時結束這個談判；然後再實行她的一貫政策，把協定中有利於日方的奉為法理的根據，而切實施行。去年英日兩國所訂立的所謂上海海關協定，日本藉協定的規定，而控制了江海關；但是對於協定中規定應賞歐美的債務，卻始終沒有履行，這就是一個例子。日本以蠢食的政策，逐漸消減各國在華的勢力，比較上是一個安全的辦法，所以在這次談判中，日本未必會堅持英國承認遠東新事態的要求；英國如果為着日本對於這點不會堅持，便對於其他各點予以讓步，那就是助威了日本的策略。我們以為老成持重的英國人，總不會看不到這點，而竟致墜入慢性毀滅自己的途徑！</p>

<p>教育消息</p>
<h3>中國大學課程　編訂之沿革與意見（上）　清季大學課程漫無系統　國詂成立後即着手整理</h3>
<p>（重慶特訊）教育部對於大學課程發表「編訂之沿革與意見」一文、爰錄於下、</p>
<p>中國專科以上學校課程、非自始即如此凌亂繫頣也、淸季大學堂之經濟·法政·文學·格致·農工商醫·八科、及高等農工商實業各學堂、與優級師範學堂之課程科目、均詳載於奏定學堂章程、革命后、民元頒之專門學校規程、民二頒之大學規程、亦均設有專條、規定各該種學校之科目、其所規定、容或未盡妥善、且亦未定修改增訂之期、稍涉硬性、不能隨時代之演進而改進、但各校設課、有所遵循、不致巧立名目、漫無系統、稽核旣易程度較齊、欲求改進、亦有所本、此種統一課程制度、自我國創設大學以來、行之的二十年之久、</p>
<p>迨民國十一年十一月、公布學制系統改革案、其精神在發揮平民教育精神、適應社會進化需要、謀個性之發展、而多留各地方伸縮餘地、因主張「大學校用選科制」於是專科以上學校之統一課程制度遂根本動搖，民國十三年二月、教部本新學制系統之原則、訂定國立大學校條例公布之、第六條云、「國立大學修業年限四年至六年、其課程得用選科制、」關於製訂課程之權、條例第七條云、一國立大學校各科各學系及大學院、各設教授會、規劃課程及其進行事宜、各以本科本學系及大學院之正教授教授組織之、」同條復云、「各科茶規劃課程時、講師並應列席、」各科系之課程、旣由各校自訂、遂難免各校之因人設課、巧立各目、以主持者觀念之不同、遂致設課目標之各異、其下焉者、則無主試·東鈔·西凑、拉雜排列、各校課程、遂演成上節所述紛歧繁複之現象、又因人事之變遷無常、課程開設、亦常在變更不定之中、乃愈支離破碎、</p>
<p>新學制系統案之精神、原在發揮民主精神、使優良者有自由發展機會、但其結果、人才不足之大學、其課程設施、固易簡陋、不能符社會希望及大舉的水準、而人才優裕之大學、其課程發展、復有趨於專門與艱深之弊、故在民國十三四年間、國內之大學最發達、而受人詬病之處亦最多、十七年五月、第一决全國教育會議宜言有云、「大學教育應該確定標準、提高程度、我們議決請大學院頒布大學畢業考試及學位授予條例、以后各大學辦理畢業時、應舉行學生歷年課程的總考試、合格的給予證書、不得授予學位、凡學士碩士兩級的學位、均須另經大學院考試或審查合格后、由大學院授予、」宣言又云、「我們規定私立學校課程師資和設備的標準、從事積極的指導獎勵或取締、」是對於大學程度表示不滿、而欲於大學課程作部分的規定矣、</p>
<p>十八年八月、教部公布大學規程、遂規定一年級應設之基本科目、規程第八條並云、「各學院或各科之課目分配及課程標準另定之、」</p>
<p>十九年七月、又公布大學課程及設備標準起草委員會章程、自是時起、教部對於大學課程、即曾延聘專家、着手整理、在朱前部長家驊時代、進行允力、二十年八月、朱前部長在中央黨部紀念週報吿、曾指責大學課程之注重高深功課、而輕視基本功課之現象云、「經濟學系、經濟槪論可以不有、馬克斯的資本論非有不可、文學方面、文學史之類的功課不關重要、各個名家的作品、非特設課程不可、地質系中有非一專門古生物的講座不可、至於普通地質學、隨便呌什麽學探礦的、或學土木工程的人來教授、都不緊要、物理方面、普通物理可不注重、愛因斯坦的相對論、不管教者學者如何、都非有不可、甚至於數學的微積分、都可馬馬虎虎找一個人來担任的、一同時、朱前部長、指出大學課程之重複現象云、「譬如法學院中、旣有中國外交史、不平等條的、便無另設課程之必要、因爲把不平等條的除了之后、中國外交史、還有什麼好講呢、這種分設課程、豈不是重床疊架嗎、「也有設立些本系不必要的功課、例如地質系中設了許多採礦、冶金的功課、化學系中設了許多化學工業的功課之類、「如果把國內各大學的課程表拿來仔細一看、我們很可以指出很多功課是沒有另自開班必要的、」</p>

<h3>一九三九——四〇年　男子籃球規則更改</h3>
<p>— （瞿鴻律譯）</p>
<p>本季籃球規則重要更改、經美國National　Board　RuleCommittee審定下列幾項、雖尙未正式公佈、大致已通過、節譯如下、</p>
<p>（一）籃板至底綫（端綫）距離改爲四呎（譯者按舊規則爲二呎或四呎）、最大及最佳之球塲、其長度應爲九十四呎、籃板與籃板之距離爲八十六呎、（美國各學校一致贊成籃板至端錢距離改爲四呎、故Rule　Committee已通過此條、）</p>
<p>（二）技術犯規罰球後、不論中籃與否、由罰隊在中綫（分塲綫）處擲球入塲、如係侵人犯規、則罰隊隊長有權放棄罰球、而選在中綫處由其隊員擲球入塲、如罰球不至一决時、是條文適用於罰球最後一决、雙方犯規、不在此例、（美國National　Association　of　Basketketball　Coaches有鑒於每每在一極度緊張比賽時最後一剎那、分數落後之一隊、往往有意犯規、冀望在罰球後奪得該球、此種舉動、有損體育眞義、故有此更改、）</p>
<p>（三）正在擲籃之球員、被對方球員自後侵犯或阻撓、不論該球有否中籃、應罰二决、（該條文是欲避免種種無體育、道德粗暴舉動、）</p>
<p>（四）一隊任何球員有呌「暫停資格、換言之、呌「暫停」祇限於隊長一人、</p>
<p>（五）每一「決勝期」每隊得有一决額外「暫停、」</p>
<p>（規則委員會認爲「決勝期」並不是比賽時間一部份、故除五次」暫停」外、每一「決勝期」應增一次「暫停、」）</p>
<p>（六）規則第十四章第九條中「或籃板」（Dr·Backbord）三字删除、</p>
<p>（譯者按）除上述六條重要更改外、其中有許多字句更改、又能一一詳述、中華全國體育協進會所採用之規則、係世界運動所審定者、其有效時間爲一九三六年至一九四零年、本文根據美國全國籃球規則委員會所審定者、亦即西靑年會所採用之規則、</p>

<h3>安定外滙爲第一</h3>
<p>— 厚基</p>
<p>上海外匯黑市自本月十八日一度暴縮，不意未及三日，又吿猛緊。扒購者初以現貨供量有限，羣以期貨爲尾閭，七八份期貨受此威脅，變動更烈，行市比差，相距愈甚。因期貨之劇變，牽動現貨之安定；復因現貨之不安，加甚期貨之緊縮；互爲因果，更番作崇，而物賈之再度飛張，自在意中，國民生計，勢將感覺更甚之困難。竊以爲當前之問題，不應再以滙率高低爲目的，而應求滙價穩定之方策，比與曩昔之銀價問題，如出一轍，不患昂而患不定。蓋匯賈之高低，初不過法幣購買力之表徵，雖爲國計民生之所繫，而非當前人心不安之癥結。吾人體念國府維持外匯之過去成績，亦以穩定滙價爲當務之急，蓋匯價早得一日穩定，資金外流之風可戢，金融市塲之恐慌可弭，兩年來之事實俱在，無庸贅言。抑外匯黑市所以不安，論者有謂出於投機家之播弄，而不知「北鈔」與「期滙」問題不解決，即無投機，亦無從安定也。</p>
<p>北鈔者，華北地名之鈔券也。本市中交兩銀行業於本週之始，拒絕收受，惟零星少數，至今尙准掉換滬鈔，以免商人細民吃虧更甚。以吾人所得津方消息觀之，停用猶難收成效，蓋天津中交兩銀行對於申匯之承滙，雖已逐步收束，每日總額减至五千一萬之數，終以取費奇廉，每千元不過收手續費一元，同於平滙，利之所在，莫怪天津銀號不惜多方鑽營，分嘗一臠，而此種滙申款項，窮年累月以計之，數亦可觀，大抵以套購外滙爲出路。事實如此，上海停用北鈔效亦有限。倘能從天津着手，限制制制「北鈔」匯滬，或斷然拒收津滙，則本市「北鈔」問題，固可迎刃而解，即天津外滙市塲，亦可頓改舊觀，而上海外滙黑市所受之牽制，亦可得若干之調整焉。此其一。</p>
<p>至所謂「期匯」，即外滙黑市之期貨是。遠期滙率之由來，有由於利息平價之說，亦有由於購買力平價之說，此在平時雖具調節市塲之功效。然就今日言之，適爲戕賊金融上之工具。年來滙價之變動，遠期滙率感應輒較靈敏，而現貨反受其牽動，亦步亦趨。期滙之重要可見。去冬香港申滙以現貨及三個月遠期兩市間，投機家套做甚力，港政府下令停止遠期申滙，滙市遂定。則上海黑市外滙之期貨行市，何嘗不可以香港申滙爲例，迅即停止，减弱投機家之活躍，及現貨外滙之威脅，此其二。</p>
<p>綜上兩點，雖曰卑之無甚高論，而就事論事，「北鈔」與「期滙」，今日金融市塲之二豎也。二豎不去，外滙不定，外滙不定，市塲恐慌無由消滅，而來日大難，亦將方興未艾也。</p>
<h3>金融　滙市杌隉不寗　緊縮之勢有增無減　日商又起猛烈扒結　英金收盤四辦士半　美匯爲八元六二五　收市之後尙見續緊</h3>
<p>外匯昨日市况、匯豐掛牌九時三十分初次揭曉、悉無變無、迫至九時五十分二次揭曉、英匯改縮二五、美匯掛小四三七五、其他亦莫不一致降落、但午後二時三十分，已將掛牌除去、英美匯暗市、因日行（傳軍用品結款）又起扒結、本市各進口洋行、遂大起恐慌、亦爭先購納、華商投機家亦於暗中活動傾扒、致緊風再度爆發、竟巳呈有行無市狀態、情狀極端混亂、在塲者莫不驚心動魄、目瞪口呆、初開英金仍爲五辦士〇三一二五、美匯爲九元八一二五、而匯豐尙肯以略低之價、些微供給、故洋行等略有結進、惟至九時五十分、匯豐掛牌突又懸低、英金爲四辦士七五、美匯爲九元二五、而在此價格中、匯豐頗肯談論交易、再因香港亦會來電塞出、於是市勢頓時轉穩、盤旋至午刻刻刻、英匯鬆達四辦士八四三七五、美匯亦爲九元四三七五、午後因匯豐毫無供意、幾有停止供給之勢、更在不利利利空氣籠罩下扒風又起、匯豐竟將掛牌除去、僅還出兩價英金四辦士半、美金八元七五、（比前日英緊半辦士、美共縮九三七五、）之驚人最貴價、情况混亂不堪幾無法可覓賣戶、故延至晚收英金已達四辦士半、美匯八元六二五、但收後潛勢再緊、縮至英金四辦士二五、美匯八元二五空前紀錄、而期貨則則則則因現貨市面如此、均不敢問津、緊勢無異、交易殊少、掉期亦無形消失、現貨全天成交、亦甚淸稀、至港匯則則則無市可言、銀行等均未做開、不安之狀、可想而知矣、</p>
<p>滙豐掛牌又見改縮</p>
<p>晨開以倫敦大條近遠仍平、紐約銀價呆定、倫敦生金回大半辦士、匯兌英對美小一厘半、對滬跌三七五、對法未更、美對英縮〇六二五、對滬小二角六分、對法降一二五、中央掛牌各匯如舊、銀行晨開現貨賣價、英金五辦士〇三一二五、美匯九元八一二五、比上日午收均平、開後因洋行結款繁多、但匯豐祗肯照掛牌價維持、加以其他外行均無賣意、致市勢微緊、計洋行吸進匯豐現貨英金五辦士、並現貨美匯九元六八七五、迨匯豐掛牌揭曉、均無變動、及白銀平衡稅揭曉、依然免微、此後洋行界扒意益切、兼日銀行亦起跟蹤猛扒、加之西商沙遜亦向期貨方面力吸、但匯豐鑒於如此情形故照掛牌價停止供給、市勢更形緊軟、迨九時五十分、匯豐二决掛牌揭曉、英金改縮二五、爲四辦士七五、美匯改低四三七五、爲九元二五、其他亦一致改縮、均又創見空前新紀錄、時匯豐對於二决改定掛牌、尙肯維持、計賣予洋行及日銀行現貨英金四辦士七五、與現貨美匯九元二五、後港電突來吐塞、兼其他外行亦隨之稍賣、情勢遂趨穩定、計港電與外行東方華比麥加利相繼吐予洋行及日銀行現貨英金四辦士八一二五及八四三七五、繼而港電又塞予洋行及某行現貨美匯九元三七五及四三七五時已午刻、港匯價難還出、延至午收銀行現貨賣價英金四辦士八四三二七五、美匯九元四三七五、較晨開、英緊一八七五、美軟三七五、</p>
<p>午後已成有行無市</p>
<p>後市因一開匯整即無供意、更以港電中止拋塞、且有種種不利空氣、華商紗花帮及洋行等四起在扒、緊風再度熾烈、更聞匯豐已將掛牌價除去、未見續掛、僅還出英金爲四辦士半、美匯八元七五、然頭寸殊小、故暗市因賣戶絕跡、遂呈有行無市狀態、延至三時晚收、銀行現貨賣價、英金四辦士半、美匯八元六二五、結果較隔昨午收英續緊五三一二五、美又軟一元一八七五、（聞收後暗盤英又軟至四辦士二五、美續緊至八元二五、）最後始稍回硬至英匯四辦士三七五、美匯八元半、</p>

<p>天津英匯進四辦士</p>
<p>天津二十日電、今日匯市開盤疲弱、對英又緊二五、爲二辦士七五、（按昨日津英匯最低成交價、已縮至三便士八一二五）對美縮四三七五、爲七元三一二五、申匯升五元、爲一百卅五元、「聯鈔」暗盤貴一元、</p>
<h3>鈔換鈔　——擁擠不得了——</h3>
<p>自中交收兌其華北發行之鈔票後，祇以十元爲限，每人可兌一張，如欲重行進去掉換第二張者，爲所發現，輒行擯絕，兌者擁擠異常，派有探捕照料，魚貫而前，據某君昨往霞飛路中行兌換，從其加入魚貫行中計算時間起，至兌得十張一元鈔爲止，計費時二十五分鐘，辦事較爲敏捷，又某君前日往海格路口交行，兌換十元鈔，人頭之擠，自交行門口經靜安寺路愚園路膠州路，首尾相銜接，立二小時，不得兌，廢然而返，今不圖於紙幣盛行時代，重見當年鈔票擠兌（兌銀圓）之盛况也。</p>
<h3>消滅匯劃貼現</h3>
<p>— 玉振</p>
<p>滙劃票據，原爲隔日收現，與現鈔價値相等。自二十六年上海事變發生，財部安定金融辦法公佈後，銀錢業爲便利工商業資金活動，增加籌碼起見，爰有呈請財部核准補充辦法，規定滙劃票據，祇滙同業滙劃，不得付鈔兼及購買外滙。故八一三以後之滙劃，實際上固爲法幣存款也。日久因法幣之用途爲廣，一般存戶，受安定金融辦法之限制；不易得現，遂出貼費，將滙劃掉成法幣。二十七年份最高會至七十九元，復由中中交三行托銀行業聯合準備會出面維持，儘量調劑同業，價格始得穩定於五十元左右。今年六月二十三日財部新限制提存在上海公佈後，貼水驟高，曾有二百元之呼聲，有行無市。廿三日始有正式成交，價在一百二三十元。因有七月四日起新滙劃實行之說，六月三十日收盤，降至七十二元半。及七月四日銀錢業開業，新櫃劃實行，僅俘銀錢業內部之事，外商銀行仍不收用，故貼水反高升二十元，價在九十餘元，至十四日止站住九十五至百元之間。十五日因需要旺，見一百零六元之價。至十七日漲至一百零九元。十八日因香港方面不再按六辨土五六二五供給外滙，外滙市塲與黃金在漲，鈔票需要益增，貼水遂升至一百三十七元半，十九日價曾至一百六十五元。至二十日（昨日）因現金飛漲，外滙再縮，鈔票需要更巨，貼水巳升至二百元。即滙劃一元，祇値法幣八角三分。未聞有三行出而維持之者。惟現在滙劃，需提擔保品，向銀行準備會領用，若再繼續下跌，恐將有碍整個上海金融矣。管見所及，竊以爲滙劃，不準貼現，對於工商業正當需要，儘愛供給法幣。交換所對於同業，嗣後領用滙劃，應嚴加限制，實行緊縮。而銀錢業對於一般存戶無正當用途，要求一次付給滙劃者，亦加拒絕。如此則貼現之不正當交易，或可逐漸消滅矣。</p>
<p>烚赤購買達沸點</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初時證券帮與錢兌業等買意殷濃、即喊三千二百二三十元買進、但賣方均袖手旁觀、時忽聞外滙軟化、買風擴大、一時大家爭先恐後、放盤猛抬、處於買風籠罩下、竟抬高至三千三百元開市、乃由證券帮吸進某銀號五十兩、嗣某銀號繼續傾吐、加以某金號代投機商亦競相出籠、步瀉六十元、錢兌業賣予現金號二十兩、價二百四十元爲當日低盤、時某錢兌業復來猛吸、且賣方供意轉淡、頓即回上、復衝出三百元關外、某錢兌業進同業五十兩、價三百二十元、其時忽聞匯豐掛牌二决揭曉、一致掛縮、人心更堅、賣戶扳價愈厲、漲風擴大、某錢兌業續來猛進三百餘兩、另一錢兌業亦力購百餘兩、推波助瀾者猛抬、飛漲一百十元、衝出四百元大關、某錢兌進證券帮五十兩價四百三十元、其餘大致均由某金號（代投機商）及銀樓帮等供給、時限價喊售者頗多、故散戶及銀樓帮等爭前吐售、立見回小三十五元、現金號售予某銀樓五十兩、價三百九十五元、此後外行忽委託某銀號吸收二百餘兩、加以某金號代投機商亦進多出少、漲風重起、竟又飛躍八十五元、某金號（代投機商）進某錢兌業五十兩、竟高達三千四百八十元驚人高峯、將近午刻、因聞外匯經港電拋塞後、情勢轉穩、散戶與某錢兌業趁高出籠、立降三十元、某錢兌業　予某金號五十兩、四百五十元爲午收價、午後買氣愈濃、開市即做高五十元、錢兌業互做五十兩、價五百元、時某錢兌業力進百餘兩、做高至五百五十元、後因現金號稍來塞出、一度回低至五百二十五元、此後市上謠諑　起、加以又聞外匯因缺乏維持而劇緊、一般投機商更形騷動、在市大肆在購濫進、尙有銀樓帮亦紛代殷富者猛進、其時雖某銀號代外行多頭獲利出籠、無如仍感杯水車薪、難遏勢燄、接連打破三千六百元至九百元、四重百元大關、漲風之熾、實所罕見、入後某金號亦代客力進、兼銀樓帮亦繼續收買、續向高峯推進、結果竟以三千九百五十五元收盤、爲空前新紀錄、以隔昨竟在漲七百五十五元、查已連漲三天共計一千三百三十六元、全天有六百七十五元差度、現金號之本牌金售出價較烚赤高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢稍有成交、</p>

<p>紗市續升、漲風大有變本加厲之勢、實國外滙頻縮不已、兼之黃金飛騰、紗業市塲牽入漩渦、一般將棉紗貨物亦作現金及匯票看待、大宗心理、將外匯之變化、予紗市作比例、由此一來、紗價之升降範圍擴大矣、至於客帮實際交易、處此瘋暴變態之下、漲風之劇劇劇烈、如醉如在、從何處下手、茫無標準也、因之現紗成交大爲减削、情况反見積極、收盤之後、二十支雙馬紗價抬到五百四十五元之譜、執貨者尙不肯賣出、就人心而論、固屬看漲、然如此情形、未免過度熱烈也、</p>
<p>現紗情形晨初開盤、同業相聚議論一致望漲、檯面仍挺、開價加五元、二十支雙馬外棧售價爲五百二十六元、棧單價爲五百十九元、此時形態尙安靜、少頃買者又擁、市價再緊一步、因金價雖昂、而鈔票貼現奇昂、稍爲扯平、迨至十一時、市塲頓起變化、買戶蜂擁而來、多說英滙縮風又起、打破五辦士、黃金又見高峰、因此售價、一霎間橫跳十元、而賣者寥寥無幾、二十支雙馬外棧收盤價做到五百四十元、棧單價爲五百三十元、查半日成交一千包未滿、同行占六百六十五包、行情二十支雙馬漲二十元、牧羊漲七元半、茲將各帮口買去之額量列左、香港　二八〇　同行六六五內地　五〇　統計　九九五</p>
<p>日紗市面、亦復上升、但實際需要寥若晨星、蓋以金融緊縮所致、惟下月份貨鑒於匯兌趨縮、含投機性質之買戶、紛沓而來、市價較昂、二十支月琴現出價爲四百十七元、漲三四元之譜、</p>
<p>現鈔籌碼日枯　棉商紛將定貨結價　外棉祇有三筆交易</p>
<p>外棉市價、紐約棉市、晨初較呈疲乏、利物浦及孟買來電均吿下落、南方在市套賣頗烈、中途並無起色在第三盤時、同業交易增加、空頭抵補亦甚衆多、因之市價回漲十磅音、造成最高價收盤、印度收盤跌一羅比、預測測測漲二羅比餘、相抵尙漲一羅比半、埃及跌五磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、新交易未聞做開、已數週、自星二匯兌發生暴縮後、引起各富有者、爭購外匯、因之大宗鈔票運入外灘銀行、同時現鈔需要日增、而籌碼日缺、貼現率因而猛漲不巳、造成金融日趨困難之途、各同業有鑒及此、前訂之貨、恐將來到貨時籌款困難、念及乘此貨未運出尙有厚利可圖之時、向洋行方面結價、實　上策、</p>
<p>另訊本棉交易、又告絕跡、大槪情况紛亂中、雙方談判殊難接近、未能妥協、惟印棉同業仍有兩筆互做買賣、價格增加三元、鴻童廠進三二支至四十支原料巴西棉一百三十件、價爲一百四十元、係匯劃送廠價、其他廠商絕少生氣、蘇北來源、因上日風雨交作、颶風二次侵襲、輪運停駛、故未見抵滬、茲將現棉情形如左、惠司登　一一〇·〇〇　同業中進　二〇〇件　鈔票棧交巴西棉　一四〇·〇〇　又　一三〇件　匯劃又白洛去　一〇〇·〇〇　又　一〇〇件　鈔票又</p>
<h3>疋頭　人心浮動　一般又在囤購棉布</h3>
<p>國布</p>
<p>昨外匯又縮、貼現猛升、市上人心浮動、購囤現貨、以冀减免幣値損失之空氣漸吿濃厚、國布賣買常例、仍以匯劃計價居多、貼現率目下暴漲達二百元後、國布與東疋價格相較、國布已一致較東疋爲廉、故頗引起一般囤戶興趣、購囤又吿踴躍、現需亦獲轉機、售盤粗布·細布·細斜粗斜每疋漲五分至二角、色布·色斜印染各貨以原料漂染費成本均已高漲、開價亦提高每疋一角至二角半、英商現鈔價各貨售盤不動、未街囤戶成交最旺、計細斜·細布·粗布二百餘包·色布·色斜嗶嘰·綫呢·印花絨等貨一百餘箱、染廠採辦染坯·細布·細斜二百餘包、粤港南洋帮辦細斜一百餘包、色布·色斜百餘箱、色布·色斜·漂白貨二千數百疋、川滇帮成交藍布色斜印花貨。綫呢等貨一百餘包、</p>
<p>東疋</p>
<p>白貨市盤因業內外心里交易、繼續旺盛、細布·細料又趨上騰、十二磅龍頭細布現貨漲至十四元四角、期貨十四元六角、午後本街染坯實銷亦起動辦、致市勢益挺、雖現鈔貼率在升在二百元左右、而全日細布。細斜之現期貨訂開、仍有一千件之譜、</p>
<h3>油餅　油貴非常</h3>
<p>生油　香港採辦殷切、况且金價有漲無跌、致在二重鼓勵之下、行情亟亟騰踊、比上日再漲半元至一元六七角、計共做開膠州油簍裝六百件、新聽裝一千五百聽、烟臺聽裝一千聽、靑島鐵桶裝五十餘桶、大連鐵桶裝五十桶、行情均詳市價欄、請參觀、</p>
<p>豆油　人心依然堅昂、市價續砌二三角、成交膠州油二百件、價爲三十四元八角至三十五元二角、靑岐油一百件、價爲三十五元二角、烟岐油一百件、價爲三十五元八角、天津聽裝油一千聽、便爲四十五元五角、大連油五十桶、價爲四十八元七角、神戶來連油六十桶、價爲四十八元七角至四十九元云、</p>

<h3>日方昨又狂扒　黑市外匯復緊俏　黃金飛漲近四千元大關　華北地名零鈔仍予收兌　投機家或遭慘敗</h3>
<p>平準外匯基金委員會、爲防止套買、限制供給外匯後、昨因日行扒吸、致黑匯又縮、黃金因投機者之操縱、價格飛漲、創新紀錄、匯劃貼水、竟漲至二百元中國整個金融、不受影響、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<h3>滙市昨受另一震動</h3>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本埠匯市今（二十日）晨受另一震動、開盤時爲昨日（十九日）之收盤率、惟各買方對外匯需求甚烈、而出口商與投機家所供則頗少、結果匯率續跌、十時許美電匯行市爲九元六八七五、惟午刻縮至九元二五、英電匯亦於二小時內自五便士二五跌至四便士七五、即須法幣十元八角一分易美金一元、法幣五十元五角合英金一鎊是、兌換店美元行市一度高至法幣十一元易美金一元、</p>
<h3>各方關切自然水準</h3>
<p>香港或重慶均未發出關於中政府或平準基金的意向之消息、故市塲依然完全不知將發生何事、人心所最關切之問題、爲平準基金將認何種匯率爲法幣新的自然水準、而恢復出售外匯、以及將來出售外匯之情况如何、自中國法幣準備金之觀察點而論、目前上海之匯率、似確實貶低法幣之價値、</p>
<h3>外匯準備異常豐盈</h3>
<p>本月初、中政府諸銀行所發通貨流通額、共的二十萬萬元、而聞諸可靠方面、其外匯準備金與此流通額之正金、的計英金二千萬鎊、按照目前匯率、此二千萬鎊供作應付外匯與正金者、達法幣總値之什五左右、此項數字實使人益信上海市塲目前似在外匯買方之重壓下、投機家輕舉妄動、預購外匯、而或將受重大損失之點、或已到達矣、</p>
<h3>「虹口幣」卒告不支</h3>
<p>至於「虹口幣」、華方卒已達其目的、因今晨華興銀行已將華興幣之滙率、終止追隨法幣、而目定六便士之滙率、即較法幣高四分之一是也、因此、「虹口幣」於表面上已廢除與法幣之平價、但今上海公衆絕無準備以法幣貼水而易「虹口幣」之象、日元在目前法幣跌價中今晨首次大漲，其行市買進爲法幣一元零四分、賣出爲一元零三分五、十盎斯金條、今晨復漲至更高之水準、開盤三千三百元、午刻黑市收盤三千四百五十元、爲多年來所未聞之最高價、</p>
<p>日又狂扒</p>
<p>上海黑市外滙爆縮之後、因英商滙豐銀行對各業正當需要、仍予儘量供給、於是黑市外滙、漸趨穩定、昨晨滙豐掛牌英滙五便士、美滙九元六八七五、與前日掛牌行市相同、嗣因日行又起扒吸、市勢乃復趨緊佾、及至九時五十分、滙豐將掛牌抑低、英滙四便士七五、美滙九元二五、於是人心浮動、復趨混亂、旋因香港允予供給出售、人心較爲安定、市價漸决回鬆、</p>
<p>法滙穩定</p>
<p>財政部對於法定外匯、仍本其原定政策、予以維持、所以昨日中央銀行之法定外滙行市、英滙一先令二便士半、美滙三十美元、至於此决平準外滙基金委員會之限制供給上海黑市外滙、旨在防止某方之陰謀套買、所以上海之黑市外滙暴縮、對整個幣信、毫無影響、同時全國金融、依然穩定、各銀行之基礎、益見鞏固、况對於戰時政治力量不及地域、無限制供給外滙、與抗戰有損無益、</p>
<p>防社套買</p>
<p>對於非禁運貨品之進口、匯審核委員會申請購買法滙、則足證中國政府對於正當需要外滙、仍照法價供給、並不因黑市外匯之暴縮、而有所變更、至於外匯平準基金委員會對於上海黑市之外滙、並非不予供給、僅爲防止某方套買、予以限制而已、所以英商匯豐等銀行對各業正當需要、仍予儘量供給、惟須憑訂貨單、方得購買、關係限制掉期、係杜絕投機者之操縱、</p>
<p>收兌零鈔</p>
<p>關於華北地名（天津）之鈔票問題、新聲社記者昨向中交兩行探悉、該兩行分行除電總行請示外、業巳會商妥善辦法、今對於是項鈔票、决予價量收兌、惟爲防止鉅額搬運來滬套買外匯計、不得不對鉅數酌予限制、今中交上海分行對零星少數儘量兌換、則足證是項鈔票仍得通用、現决繼續收兌、並望各界對於浙興·中實·通商·四明·農商·農工·浙地等鈔券、亦不予拒絕收受、</p>
<p>黃金飛漲</p>
<p>現金暗市因外匯暴縮、以致價格飛漲、創新紀錄後、一般投機者紛紛購買黃金、昨日暗市收盤、竟漲至三千九百五十五元、實爲有史以來所未有、銀樓大同行掛牌、昨日午後改掛四百元、新同行爲三百九十八元、一般之觀察、因投機者之操縱、現金價恐將破四千元大關、又匯劃貼水、因投機者需要現鈔紛紛以匯劃票據、向一般小錢店要求貼水、因此繼續飛漲、咋日竟漲至二百元之鉅、</p>
<p>銀業例會</p>
<p>上海銀行業公會、於昨日下午二時、舉行執行委員會例會、到吾蘊濟·葉扶霄·林康侯·潘久芬等、由吳蘊齋主席、顧誠庵紀錄、除報吿一週間之會務外、旋即於二時三十分散會、據該會秘書對新聲社記者稱、咋日之執行委員會例會、並無提案、外傳該會提出討論、　黑市外匯暴縮問題、　天津地名之鈔票兌換問題、殊非事實、因該會對上述兩問題、實無提出討論之必要、</p>
<p>金融穩定</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀錢業探悉、上海金融市塲、自財政部限制提存後、提存風潮已平息、謠言已無、人心安定、銀行聯合準備委會之新匯劃制度、於七月四日起實行後、頗收成效、市塲驟吿靈活、各業間接直接受益匪淺、銀錢業各種利率依然如舊、中中交農四行貼放委會、對於同業金融、仍予竭力調劑、所以金融市塲、依然穩定如恒、關於現金之飛漲及證券之低落、黑市外匯之暴縮、全係投機份子操縱所致、</p>
<h3>日稱英軍戰傷雇工　全屬妄言　英方澈查並無此事　日竟認爲存心欺侮</h3>
<p>字林報云、日方通訊社消息謂、自英軍當局吾認東旭萊聯隊哨兵一名、於星期一日晨用槍刺戳傷鐵路華籍僱工之後、華中鐵道公司頃以對英人與英貨拒不予以便利相威脅云、記者昨（十九日）以此事叩諸英領署某員、據稱、英軍當局已加</p>
<p>徹底調查並未發現有截刺事件云、日通訊社消息又謂、鐵道公司稱、英軍當局之吾認、爲「恬然存心欺人之意」、而英軍阿煦摩少校則稱日方之指摘爲「全屬妄言」、據華中鐵道公司營業部副主任</p>
<p>井上聲稱關於諸鐵道為建設新中國之交通動脈、對華人日人與第三國人士以及彼等之貨物、供給迅速而安全之運輸、故該公司認爲僱工一名無故受傷、乃最可遺憾者、此種舉動、實同阻撓從事建設東亞新秩序者之職務、華中鐵道公司有經例取之途徑、</p>
<p>提出要求之意、今視英當局所取態度而定、若發現英人意在仇視華中樹立和平與秩序之證據、則公司方面有被迫拒不載運英人及英貨之可能云、聞日方昨日未向英軍或領署當局提出抗議、英領署某員末稱、若有此種抗議到來、吾人將取對付之步驟云、</p>
<h3>證劵暗市昨狂跌　惟四行為安定市面起見　准予於七底起貼現抵借</h3>
<p>財政部自一月十五日通吿因關稅被截、規定此後償付關稅擔保之內外債辦法後、對七月三十一日到期之民國一十五年統一公債第七决應付本息、不得巳暫行停付、惟中中交農四行爲安定市面起見、允予將本息單貼現抵借、由該四行發給「貼現憑證」、準七月底起開始辦理、上海證券曙市、昨晨由渝電財政部發言人聲稱、統一公債停付本息、一般散戶起恐慌、賣氣突熾、因此價格在跌、茲錄其收盤行市如下、統一甲種五十二元八角、跌叫元六角、乙種四十四元四角、跌三元零五分、丙種四十三元零五分、跌三元四角、丁種四十二元、跌三元九角、戊種四十三元三角五分、跌二元六角五分、</p>
<h3>颶風掠過滬西　幸未正面襲擊　登陸後風力已減小　風向急變頗可驚奇　浦江潮量頗鉅馬路泛濫</h3>
<p>徐家滙天文台於昨晨六時報吿、颶風在杭州灣登陸後、已進至東經一一九度、北緯三〇度、方向北北西、風力自登陸後已漸戢、上海並未正面受颶風襲擊、該颶風在上海之西杭州附近、上海掠過而已、惟因受颶風影響、氣候驟變、有陣雨及疾風、江海關以及蘭路之信號塔、前晚起懸紅燈兩盞、即代表黑球兩枚、警吿船隻不得出入行駛、</p>
<p>黑球卸下航行恢復</p>
<p>颶風在上海之西掠過後、江海關及蘭路信號塔、昨晨懸黑球一枚警吿船隻應仍戒備、及至昨日下午二時、始將黑球卸下、於是黃浦江內之船隻、完全恢復航行、於是太古怡和南北洋班、以及長江下游各船隻、一律照常出入黃浦江、惟此决上海幸未受正面襲擊、否則昨晨又值黃浦江高潮、滬市勢必受重大損失、但已有若干棧房遭水侵入、以至少數貨一物遭受水漬、</p>
<p>將在京蕪之間消滅徐家匯天文臺昨日下午六時報吿、颺風已進至東經一一八·四〇度、北緯三一度、方向爲西北西、的在南京蕪湖之間、風力巳减小爲四個至五個、或將在該處消滅、浙江杭州灣一帶、以及杭州附近各處、此决受颶風之襲擊、地方損失爲數不貲、</p>
<p>浦江高潮幾將平岸</p>
<p>本埠因迭被颺風所襲擊、浦江潮位亦被激起頗高、今日晨三時十五分之高潮、數量頗鉅計有十一英尺二寸、今日午後四時高潮、則有九英尺六寸、明（廿二）日晨前四時零二分高潮、計有十一英尺、明日午後四時五十五分高潮、計有九英尺四寸四、至外灘駁岸之高度、計爲十三英尺、故高潮距岸、極爲密邇、</p>
<p>低處馬路一片汪洋</p>
<p>經一度之在風暴雨、較低之四川路·江西路·福州路·南京路·英華街·浙江路·貴州路·廣西路·愛文義路·新閘路·白利南路·法租界霞飛路·西門路·巨箱達路·辣斐德路·呂班路·等、因雨水一時不及發洩、同時浦江高潮、潮水倒灌、致均成澤國、滬西允甚、昨晚尙未退盡、</p>
<p>海輪輸出均受阻滯</p>
<p>江海關鐘樓上之二黑球、巳於昨日移去、颶風警吿解除、惟東南風仍緊、浦江水浪滔滔、對於航運、尙未全復、茲將昨日各輪情形、探錄於下、自靑島來滬之山東輪、遲至下午五時許始進口、大英蘇旦號、由津回滬、藍烟囱公司晏呑拿號、由利物浦來滬、至下午六時、海關尙無進口報吿、但據公司云、並未接遲到電報、昨晚或今晨、定可到滬、蘇旦號原定今日出口返歐、因遲到之故、返歐亦當順延一天、行駛長江下游各輪、至昨日下午八時、尙未見到埠、祗日商大華輪、於昨日下午五時十分、自新港返滬、停靠外灘三號碼頭、各輪如昨晚回滬者、今晨當照常出口、如昨晚不能回滬、今日出口、叉將無輪、怡和同和輪、昨日因避風未能返滬、現改明日進口、義和輪原定昨晨開往北沙、在滬避風、改定明晨出口、法國郵船公司霞飛將軍號、自馬賽來滬、並不受颶風影響、仍照原定船期、準今日下午五時抵滬、停靠虹口公和祥碼頭、接客小輪儎乘客、於今日下午六時許至新關碼頭登陸、美國總統輪船公司柯立芝總統號、已於昨日下午五時四十分起椗出口赴香港小呂宋、怡和阜生輪咋晨亦已出口赴香港、至太古濟南·怡和貴生·兩輪、照船期規定昨日應出口、因前日本市有颶風報吿、客貨未能照裝、故改今日出口、滬甬綫德平哈納兩輪、原定今晨起程、亦因颺風、客貨未裝乃亦延遲一天、定明晨四時出口赴甬乘該兩輪之旅客、今晚務須上船、又聞謀福輪、前晚因鎭海口外風汛頗大、特駛至金塘島避風、昨日午後、已駛回外封鎖綫外、定二十三日可以自鎭海載零裝貨返滬、</p>
<p>安利搭客生死未卜</p>
<p>瑞商瑞豐洋行新安利輪船、前於本月六日由滬開航定海、但在岱山洋面時、遭日艦阻止、並將該輪買辦寬蒓蓀及船員四人扣押、已有多日、現經該公司與日軍第三艦隊司令部接洽就緒、已准許復航、故童某亦於十六日釋放、當僱恒豐拖駁拖帶帆船三艘、載有乘客百餘人及土產甚多、經行來滬、十八日商務、該拖輪駛抵銅沙洋面、因受颶風襲擊、船纜折斷、帆船一艘、內有童等及旅客三十餘人、漂泊不知去向、生死未卜、其餘乘客船員、則於前晚八時抵滬、聞公司方面、現正分請各方協助尋訪失踪之船員及帆船、</p>
<p>日方電訊一部中斷</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、此次颶風、風勢北轉、然其移動之速、頗可驚奇、颶風今在陸上經過之路程巳遙、或巳大失其猛烈性、故南京受害當不致如沿海城鎮之甚、據日方報紙載稱、颶風風尾將日本政府之上海長崎間電綫吹斷一部份、而京滬間電話業務、亦因强烈之風而中斷、日華航空公司之飛機、咋（十九日）均奉令停飛、各飛機塲未聞有損壊者、</p>
<h3>受外匯及颶風影響　食米昨又漲價　存米減少為現在應有現象　倘無特殊原因趨勢仍穩定</h3>
<p>租界當局於本月十七日起規定國米限價、最高白粳不得超過二十元、最高客秈不得超過十六元後、各項國米、均在限價以下交易、昨日起、因黑市外匯暴縮、洋米訂價提高、雜糧商已中止訂購、同時颶風關係、恐江浙皖三省早稻、蒙受影響、以致米商不允出售、價格看漲、於是市塲各米、均漲二三角、而眞正頭號白粳及客秈、均不頭在市塲出售、</p>
<p>公會發表存米總數</p>
<p>豆米業公會昨日發表上海存米總數、爲三十萬零零四百八十一包、較上週减少四萬四千四百二十一包、堆存棧房、以中國銀行中國實業浙江興業上海銀行等堆棧爲大宗、叉向米業團體探悉、江浙皖三省之早稻、略受颶風影響、晚稻因尙未成熟、並無影響、秈米之由蕪湖運滬、最近又受日方阻撓、現販商向前途交涉中、</p>
<p>存米仍敷需用三月</p>
<p>據米業中人稱、存米减少爲靑黃每年同期必有之現象、至於全市存米、包括各米店內棧、及市民購存之貨、估計亦近三十萬包、若以每月消耗數量計算、則現有存米、仍敷三個月之需、</p>

<h3>柯立芝輪與　日輪互撞　兩輪損壊均微　風高浪急所致</h3>
<p>大陸報云、柯立芝總統號輪、昨日（十九日）自日本駛抵此間不久在浦江中與日本貨輪日新丸相撞、總統號上搭客兩人險受傷、時爲午後一時四十五分、該橫渡太平洋巨輪柯立芝總統號方轉身使輪首向南、聞兩輪損壊尙微日輪於相撞後、立即</p>
<p>駛往海中而柯立芝總統號則定今日（二十日）午後五時繼續其航程、駛往香港、據目擊者昨晚語記者、柯立芝總統號被撞於輪舷中腰左右、散步甲板大鋼板之一被撞致凹、頭等餐窒及其下房艙之一部份亦受損壊、當兩輪相撞時、總統號上兩搭客在房艙中、雖艙窗洞穿、玻璃搗碎、然兩人均避開而未受傷、當總統號輪在十二號浮筒附近</p>
<p>完全停駛時日輪日新丸的在五百碼外、順流而下、其引擎顧已關閉、另一艘日輪長崎丸相距亦不遠、係在總統號輪以後數分鐘駛入吳淞口者、惟於浦江中駛至美輪以前、出事時風勢强烈、日輪日新丸逆風而行、終乃駛至十二號浮筒附近、發覺巳失控制、而撞及總統號、日</p>
<p>新丸損壞大都在輪首距水面的三十呎以上、總統號輪上雖稍起擾攘、惟一切均在完善控制之下、總統輪船公司技師立卽奉派登輪調查、據彼等稱、該輪稍有損壊、不致阻其南行、據總統公司人員聲稱、該輪或將駛至香港作必要之修理云、</p>

<h3>白俄避暑　迭遭阻礙</h3>
<p>大陸報云、聞慕爾鳴路之白俄移民委員會現公然爲日本輪船援手、對白俄移民請簽准護照、俾乘非日輪而往侵佔區各口岸者、加以種種阻碍、共辦法大半爲對欲往靑島·烟台·威海衛等地消暑之白俄、領取護照者、還不簽准、欲乘英輪或</p>
<p>其他外輪啟程者、時或被迫鵠候二三星期、始發出必要之證件、且該委員會坦然告大多數白俄云、此種遲延、乃因彼等欲乘非日輪之故、亦有數白俄、申請護照之簽准、而欲乘非日輪啟程者、委員會公然吿以</p>
<p>乘搭日輪爲宜、不然，欲得護照之簽准、縱非不可能、亦甚困難云、昨（十九日）聞白俄移民委員會當局此舉、對第三國航運雖無重大影響、惟亦有日人從事之反英運動微象、因英國航運公司受</p>
<p>此舉影響較他國一切航運公司爲甚也、今夏前往靑島與烟台消暑者、多屬白俄、其中雖頗少乘頭等艙者、惟載客往此等避暑地之收入、出自白俄者爲數亦復可親、</p>

<p>新聲社記者昨向中國交通兩銀行探悉、上海情形特殊、關於出口貨之應向中交結售外滙、迄未實施、所以必需品之進口、得向中交申請外滙、始終未奉財政部或總行之命令、又向海關方面探悉、上海自淪陷後、江海關對出口貨之應結外滙、及禁止奢侈品及非必需品之進口、因環境關係、均未實施、所以奢侈品之由淪陷區域各關進口、依然如故、惟是項奢侈品、祇准在淪陷區域銷售、絕對禁止轉口至非淪陷區域以內、</p>
<p>促進土貨出口貿易</p>
<p>爲促進土貨出口貿易、規定出口貨物結滙領取滙價差額辦法、准許土貨自由運銷解除商民困難、惟出口土貨所得之外滙、仍應售予中國或交通兩銀行、此外並飭各省努力增加生產、對土貨之出口、豁免捐稅、代保兵險便利運輸、關於桐油茶葉猪鬃礦產四類、由統制二機關盡量收購、指定各新交通綫運港集中出口、今年前月份出口土貨、已增至八千三百五十四萬一千三百二十七元、已創戰後之最高新紀錄、預料此後出口價値、更見增加、</p>

<h3>冒險帆船與柯立芝輪　在太平洋中相遇　柯輪長與安徒遜停船話舊　船員乘客以實物書報相贈　太平號備遭苦楚仍冒險前進</h3>
<p>大陸報云、美郵輪柯立芝總統號輪、昨（十九日）自神戶駛抵上海、携來在海中與自上海出發駛往舊金山之帆船太平號相遇之消息、該輪於上星期四日自火奴魯魯駛往橫濱途中傍晚遙見懸美旗之帆船一艘、漸近、見該船中有六人、其中一人爲柯立芝總統號輪長柯爾梅斯德所相識者、其人即四月間偕俄籍夫人、舟子四人、及</p>
<p>一犬一貓駕四十五呎長之帆船自上海出發駛往金門博覽會而迭遇惡運之船長安徒遜是、其時太平號在北緯三四·四三度、東徑一五五·〇一度處、的一月之前、柯爾梅斯德輪長曾在神戶遇安徒遜、而指點航行之方向、故而相識、當柯立芝總統號在太平號後之百碼時、柯輪長即高聲招呼、安徒遜聞之、揮手答覆、柯立芝輪遂停駛、而漸泊</p>
<p>該小帆船旁、時該船隨暴風雨而漂流者、已歷七日、食糧與飲水俱缺、柯立芝輪員與搭客乃紛紛贈以書報·糖果·肉類·麵紛·蛋·罐頭食品·甚至氷結漣、並將太平號之水槽七個、滿注飲水、據安徒遜稱、太平號駛入海中後、會見貨輪兩艘在其附近駛過、船上未携無綫電、已駛出其航綫的六十哩、柯輪長遂復指點該船、</p>
<p>東駛避風並估計的四十五至五十五日可駛抵美國、因船長安徒遜不擬駛往火奴魯魯或他島也、太平號泊柯立芝輪畔一小時半之後、乃在微風中駛離、輪上搭客、羣相歡送、按太平號備有十四匹馬力之輔助引擎一具、所携燃料、足供晝夜行駛十二日、每小時航率的四海哩半、安徒遜夫婦原於四月七日偕舟子華人三、俄人一、</p>

<p>駛入海中二十九日矣、安氏航海、已有三十一年之經騐、此决擬駛美國、而將其帆船陳列於金門博覽會與紐的世界博覽會、若紐的博覽會閉幕前不及趕到、則安氏亦擬駛往紐的、然後於一九四〇年駛抵在歐洲舉行之世界運動會、查最近在太平號以前作橫</p>

<h3>廣勇</h3>
<p>— 耿之</p>
<p>在都市的街頭，我時常看見這樣的喜劇：拳頭大，臂膊粗者，拉牢了骨瘦如柴的「雞肋一痛打；一大羣的人甚至掮槍弄棒，和一二個手無等鐵的人對壘：年輕力壯的小夥子，將年邁蒼蒼的老頭子，打得頭破血流，或者將羽毛未豐的「醜小鴨」，打得涕淚漣洏：男子漢，太丈夫，將婦道人家，一掌打翻在地，一脚踢倒墻脚邊……我對於這些佔上風，得便宜的英雄，總要當面喝彩，暗暗讚美說：勇哉，眞正不可多得也，而這些英雄呢，也的確都是可兒，往往能盡如人意，無論對方如何躱避，求饒，他們總會澈底地與以「膺懲」，給旁覜者以痛快：勇士勇士；勇士不出，如蒼生何！</p>
<p>在別的地方，我也曾另外看見過一種勇士：和人相駡，站在自己的地方，向對方說，有種的就過來；一方面則　袖子，拔鞋子，作盡盤馬彎弓的姿勢，等對方也來這麽一套，於是「人不犯我，我不犯人」，於是三通鼓罷，不見兵刃之旣接，就此嗚金收兵，於是保全「若怯」之大勇，彼此各有千秋；萬一對方不識相，不懂這種互相標榜，以成勇名的訣巧，居然聲勢洶洶，一躍而前，欲得而甘心，我們的勇士雖然用了三十六計之上計，還會回過頭來說，有種的站在那裏不要逃，等我回去呌我的阿哥來！於是氣燄之高，依然蓋過了對方，勇名得以常保！</p>
<p>似乎勇之所以爲勇，有了以上諸人，已經可以略見不止一斑，不必再請教多人了吧。因此，歷古以來所傳說的勇的條件，可見都是不對的，不信，可以略為解釋如下：</p>
<p>「自反而縮」，要想憑著赤手空拳，進入「千萬人」之中，不過像螞蟻一般，給人踏殺，何必；「不膚撓」就有皮破血出的痛苦，「不目逃就有眼被戳瞎的危險，豈不寃哉；「勇者」如果薩不懼」，豈非成了不孝之子，因爲「身體膚髮，受之父母，」理應是「不敢毀傷」的，豈非自作自受的妄人，因爲「知命者是不立乎巖墻之下的」；一怒而天下安的「大勇」，畢竟是說說的，因爲怒本來不是「勇」；「希臘人遇希臘人」（Greek　meets　greek），天下那有這許多「希臘人」給你去「遇」，須逢敵手」方下棋，自然笨極笨極；……</p>
<p>因此，歷古以來所傳說的勇士，也都是騙騙人的，不信，請你們看：刺秦王的荊軻，要將匕首藏在圖中，刺王僚的專諸，要將劍藏在魚腸之內，免不了遮遮掩掩，偷偷摸摸；「在百萬軍中，取上將首級，如探囊取物耳」的「吾弟翼德，雖然在長坂橋上耀武揚威了一陣，結果還是「燒橋而退」；一直到淸朝的「巴圖魯」，雖是名副其實的「勇號」，而有此「勇」號的，却是幾根「老槍」；再加西洋的吉訶德先生，何等豪俠自喜，然而他對「風車」作戰，比了自命「老子給兒子打」的阿Q，還不是一樣的善自解嘲，給人瞧不起；……</p>
<p>所謂天經地義的勇，就只有我開首所說的諸般事情；所謂眞不二價的勇士，就只有我開首所說的幾種英雄。歸納起來，勇事爲：强陵弱；衆暴寡；少壯欺老弱；男欺女；……勇士爲：强盜：惡棍：流氓：癟三；……而今而後，我們對於勇事和勇士的觀念，要完全改過才是，吾則不是少見多怪，便是不明事理，而有眼不識泰山，自然其禍尤其大了云。</p>
<p>孔夫子尚駡好勇的子路說，一暴虎憑河，死而無悔者，吾不與也　」現在國際間又正在盛行着兼併弱小，打破「勝之不武」的陳言腐語：我的話，就是我所廣的勇，那還有什麼錯的地方呢！</p>
<h3>急水灘</h3>
<p>— 徐靑</p>
<p>年靑的人們又在歌唱了，音節分成兩種，一部份人才唱到了尾聲，一部分人又起頭了，循環着，永沒有休止。</p>
<p>長着山羊鬚的舵夫不耐煩地打着艙板，又像賣弄似地說：</p>
<p>「看，前面就是急水灘了，你們得安靜點哪！人都擠到一塊，一會兒船頭抬不起呢！」</p>
<p>歌唱被他一陣的掃興結束了。</p>
<p>「得啦！誰不知道！」</p>
<p>「自個不肯賣力，還說人的。今晚個，趕不到市頭，明兒早上得餓肚子！」</p>
<p>這埋怨使船頭上的撑篙漢子起了不平；</p>
<p>「眞寃死人！全有個時候的哪！你們書沒讀了，就能做官嗎？」</p>
<p>「傢伙——」最年靑的一個話還未出口就停住了。於是人們全向着前面注視了。</p>
<p>一陣松濤似的喘息，震破這突然沉默下來的氣氛。江水在二百碼地方展開一片急瀨，兩支山脚直伸到江裏，礁石與礁石的橫列又把這急瀨攔住，於是水浪起了瘋狂的咆哮。</p>
<p>平底船向着急瀨的邊沿倒溯上去，水聲由喘息而成了雷鳴。</p>
<p>「啊喲哎呀！」悽厲的吆喊抖動了，一個鐵腰抵住一支篙桿，船頭向急瀨猛然抬起，旣而整個船身都投入了這片狂嘯。</p>
<p>岸上：縴夫弓着背，像兩隻鷺鶿，踏一塊巖石，履一叢荆草，烈日灼着紫黑的背肩，　索不斷鳴嗚地吹號。</p>
<p>「啊喲哎呀！」這一下個悠厚實的肩頭猛撲下去，篙桿彎成個半圓形了。</p>
<p>「啊喲哎呀！」岸上悠長地合唱着，出神的呼唱會减輕重量的。</p>
<p>「人們兩邊靠哪！快出灘了！」舵夫蒼老着聲帶。</p>
<p>急水灘駛過了，江水又結着藍色輕盈的夢。</p>
<p>撑篙漢放下篙桿子，乏得躺下了，拿起竹鞭子呼呼地抽着烟；舵夫理着鬚根，默默地：縴夫涉過了水，濕脚毫不顧忌地闖進船來；年靑的客人們又劃破了剛才的靜默。</p>
<p>「噲！船老大！說『起來！』好不好？啊喲哎的！誰打傷你呢？」</p>
<p>「好！聽你的！」大嘴巴裹噴出一個烟圈。</p>
<p>「沈春根！你會唱了嗎？」</p>
<p>這忠實的縴夫點了點頭。</p>
<p>於是，激昂的歌唱又起來了，雅的與粗的相合配着。</p>
<p>江水淸澈而平滑，船夫的嘴上從此就流傳着新盈的歌曲：</p>
<p>「……前進！進！」</p>
<p>「起來！……」</p>
<p>循環着，循環着。</p>

<h3>喜樂（三）</h3>
<p>眞而太的喜樂，由於神人的交通。人與神有交通，這一句話，驟然一聽，頗似飄渺，其實非常切實。何以呢？人與神的交通，是由於人的信仰，不假知識，不惜學問，不需物力，不用勤勉，不必尋求，只要信仰，真實不欺，神與人立即交通，這是最切近而實在的事，絕非空談。有人說：我信上帝的存在，也信上帝是獨一眞神，我信耶穌是上帝的兒子，）未必）也信耶穌是道成肉身（更未必）何以並無喜樂呢？我說魔鬼也信。你的信仰與魔鬼的信仰，在一道水平綫上，眞神與你不發生關係，縱有關係，也不過神的震怒，常在你身上，你只有憂愁　怕，那裏能有喜樂呢？如果以這樣的信仰爲信仰，簡直是自欺。自欺的結果，最號也不過自己麻醉自己，麻醉是暫時，而不能永久，從右喜樂，轉瞬即逝，忽來忽去。這種喜樂，不眞也不大。我所說眞而大的喜樂，由信仰的來。信仰　與神有交通。信仰的眞義，是信服；服是服從。若信仰而不服從，那是魔鬼的信仰。何爲服從呢？就是照着上帝的話一字一句脚踏實的做去。上帝的話在那裏呢？在聖經裏面。你信聖經是上帝的話麽？你眞願順從上帝的話，不曰欺欺人麽？那末，我可以保澄你得天上來的喜樂。　上海基督教文字佈道會郵箱一二二七號</p>
<h3>紅鬼子瓦西卡</h3>
<p>— 高爾基著　狄周譯</p>
<p>「結婚……這能够嗎？我巳經有三年不到教堂去了……這還了得！啊喲，你找到了好妻子啦！你想我會給你生孩子嗎？」</p>
<p>一想到小孩，心裏就覺得好笑起來。瓦西卡看見她的臉，不再作聲了。……</p>
<p>『唉，我和你到什麽地方去呢？您瞧……這都一樣。你把我帶到什麽地方，要把我殺掉吧？你不是有名的怪傢伙嗎？』</p>
<p>『住嘴！』瓦西卡小聲的說。</p>
<p>可是她一邊想起過去的一切情形，一邊又數說起他的殘忍來。</p>
<p>『請你別作聲！』他向她求着，但是她不理會，所以他嘶啞的呌道：</p>
<p>『我呌你別說！』</p>
<p>這晚上他們沒有再說一句話。夜問瓦西卡說夢話，寬大的胸中發出嗄啞聲和呻吟，咬着牙齒，不時的拍拍胸頭，把右手在空中來回的搖幌着。</p>
<p>阿玖斯尼亞醒過來，站在他的床邊，好久地心懐恐怖望着他的臉。終於把他呌醒了：</p>
<p>『到底你怎樣了呢，惡鬼在紋你的頸子嗎？』</p>
<p>『是的，我做了個夢！……』瓦西卡孱弱的說，『給我點水吧。』</p>
<p>喝了水，他搖着　說：</p>
<p>『不，不，我不開堂子，……我還是做生意好，……堂子是沒有用的……』</p>
<p>『做生意……』她一而想一面說，「是的，開家店，那是好的！』</p>
<p>『一道去，好嗎？』瓦西卡要說服她似的，輕輕地問。</p>
<p>『你說眞話嗎？』阿玖斯尼亞從他床邊，退後幾步呌着。</p>
<p>『阿玖斯尼亞·謝米諾夫娜！』瓦西卡從枕匕抬起頭來，用顫慄的聲音說。</p>

<h3>李光昭揑報木價案</h3>
<p>皇上欲修築圓明圓，須採辦大批木料。前任內務府大臣誠明，前署內務府堂郞中貴寳，內務府候補筆帖式成麟，認識一在京販買木植名李光昭者，當即帶見堂官。據李謂：若到四川等省，進山伐木，用工本銀三千兩，可報効値銀五萬兩，於是令其前往採伐，遂與三人中之成麟偕行出京。嗣至湖北，探知進山伐木，非三年不能出山，工本太大。重復至廣東香港改購洋木。時法商播威利有木植出賣，李因無錢，初尙游移，成麟欲籍此補缺，據云可向其親戚借凑，遂即定買。成鱗先取木樣回京，李又至福州與播威利議定，買木三船，共洋尺三萬五千尺，每尺價洋一元五角五分，統合木價銀洋五萬叫千二百五十元。訂立合同，言明到京付款交木，若有躭延，每日加給船價洋銀五十元。李於五月至津，播威利將第一船木掖運到，李即赴京在內務部呈報木植數目，揑開洋尺五萬五千五百餘尺，價値銀三十萬兩餘。因成麟無處告貸，乏款塡付，運到木植，叉不合用，遂與洋商互控。當被查出刻有率旨採運圓明園木械李銜條，並製有奉旨採辦旗號等物。又查出洋文合同副本一紙，經繙譯後，內有圓明園李監督代大淸皇帝與某某立的字樣，據李謂漢文中並無此句，洋文係誤譯，惟漢文合同，現已無存突。此案經直督李鴻章查明，委係揑報木價，欺罔不法。且冒充園工監督，到處誰騙。遂擬摺上奏，須處以斬監候之刑云。</p>

<h3>擠換</h3>
<p>— 羅琳</p>
<p>一聲禁用華北票　萬頭攢動銀行門</p>
<p>十六日，市面上忽然發生上海將停止使用華北地名票的「謠言」，不過「謠言」終是「謠言」，去年不也曾一度盛傳國，而後來仍舊可以通用嗎。所以大家不大相信，十七日，這個「謠言」越來越大了，大家才有些慌了。十七日下午，各銀行一律拒絕收受，「謠言倒成爲事實」。市面上相當的恐慌和粉亂。十八日早報也公開刊登了，全市立刻大起騷動，大家即忙檢點自己的法幣，把華北票子檢出來，幸而銀行尙肯掉換，吾則，不是倒罄嗎？</p>
<p>有華北地名票的銀行計中國銀行，交通銀行，中國農民銀行，中國通商銀行，中國實業銀行，中國農工銀行，中國墾業銀行，浙江興業銀行，四行，河北省銀行，大中銀行等。</p>
<p>掉換地點</p>
<p>中國銀行在霞飛路：交通銀行在靜安寺；中國通商銀行在外灘；中國墾業銀行在三馬路；四行在四川路；河北省銀行在寗波路…不必一一詳述，都在它們的總行裏辦理。</p>
<p>各行巡禮</p>
<p>霞飛路中國銀行行旁有一長弄堂，掉換的人依次排成隊伍，一字長蛇形，四五丈長一隊，有四五隊一隊一隊依次掉換，須嚴守秩序，不得爭先恐後，有大批銀行執事人員維持「隊伍」。先起，中國銀行祇有一個窗口辦理，憑你辦事員手脚快，去了一個，來了一雙，實在來不及。從前剛才實行法幣，大家爭換法幣的那幅景像，宛然猶在眼前。將近十一時半，人數還有好幾百，看看實在不對，乃加添一個窗口，增加每窗口的辦事人員。還是來不及！</p>
<p>交通銀行在靜安寺，沒有弄堂可排隊伍，大家擠在門口，你爭我奪，秩序相當的不好（下午也排隊伍）。中國農民兩銀行人數也相當的多。其他各商業銀行如中國通商，浙江興業等發行數額本少，外面流通也不多，故也沒有如何擁擠。</p>
<p>數目限制</p>
<p>各銀行祇掉自己發行的鈔票，數目也有限制。中國銀行規定每人頂多一百元。因此之故，有人數目執得多的，就來了一次又來一决，反正辦事員忙忙碌碌又不認得你的。鈔票不敷分配，一木箱一木箱由卡車上運來。</p>
<p>其他各銀行，數目也都有限制，五十一百不等，大的都不超出一百元。付出來的鈔票都是一元鈔，大的是在收縮大票面法幣的流通。</p>
<p>臨時生意</p>
<p>要吃飯，異想天開，無隙不入。自有一批人，結了伴在做此千年難逢的好生意。他們三四人擁在前面，可以代你掉換，取費每元三分五分不等，不高興擁的人也就落得省力了。但是要留心，一匯眼，不看牢他們的話，連人連法幣都飛去了。向鬼去交涉去！三隻手仁兄大施神通，袋袋裏皮夾子不翼而飛的，比比皆是，須耍留心。</p>

<h3>當心假郵票</h3>
<p>— 唐可民</p>
<p>爲了分幣的缺少，郵票就做了市面上唯一的代用品，現在大家都一致通用着，仍舊維持整個的市面，使奸人們不能遂其搗亂的陰謀，那知他們挖空心思，竟在郵票上打計算，最近我用到了一張五分的假郵票，因爲它的色澤和眞的差不多，數目又小，偶不經意，溜進了我的袋里，後來回到家裏一看，就確定它是假的，五分郵票是綠色的，假的顏色比眞的深，票面上的孫中山先生遺像比較大，兩旁的兩根柱中多了些花紋，紙張比眞的薄，印刷叉窳劣，而且背面的膠水毫無黏性，有了以上的許多劣點，當然無疑地是假的了。由此可以見到奸究們的用心的一斑。這種小數目的郵票流通市上，人們大都不加注意，最可憐的是一般小販們，他們以一分二分的交易，所賺無幾，倘然用進幾張，不是要一天白做嗎？讀者們，請當心這種假郵票，同時還希望當局予以注意。</p>
<h3>西瓜補白</h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>十九日所刊「今年的西瓜」一文，筆者還在第一决發生颺風之前草成寄出，但經過了一决颶風，使瓜田和瓜市都發生了一種反常的變化，應得補充一下，以免讀者認爲失實。</p>
<p>首先，經過一决暴風雨之後，瓜田裏的瓜籐都被風吹折了，熟年頓成荒年。早熟的頭籐西瓜雖巳賣了錢，晚熟的頭籐瓜打了一個莫大的折扣，二籐瓜更不必說。所以種西瓜的農民，每個都已哭喪着臉。我們祇要看到老閘橋畔，這幾天西瓜船沒有到，便會知道西瓜巳受到風雨的打擊。過幾天放晴了，天熱風少，瓜價奇昂的，又是必然的結果。</p>
<p>同時，西瓜販子也在怨天允人，大喊倒霉。風風雨雨，小暑的天氣那麼凉爽，進的西瓜沒有人問津。而且前幾天販來的西瓜，進價很大，這幾天要脫手，非减低售價不可，蝕本旣不願，想放在家裏，等天熱了賣好價鈿，西瓜不比別種東西，多隔日子是要爛掉的，天叉老是不熱，好像有意和西瓜販子打對。</p>
<p>總之，兩决的颶風，是顚翻了整個的西瓜市塲。</p>

<h3>春申竹枝詞</h3>
<p>— 湘蘭</p>
<p>春申好，避難作桃源，歌舞承平仍達且，干戈烽火漫河山，充耳不相關。</p>
<p>春申好，國難發洋財，外匯私營三隻手，囤糧不救萬千災，貨殖笑顏開。春申好，賭窟似魔宮，車水馬龍無晝夜，呼盧喝雉競雌雄，一擲剎那中。</p>
<p>慨自國軍西撤，春申江上，仕女如雲，但苟安旦夕，充耳不聞砲火者，比比皆是。近來物價高漲，奸商操縱，外滙黑幕，銀錢業實自爲之。只可惜一般發國難財者，悖入悖出，掃數送入魔宮，風聞賭興豪者，一擲百金無吝色，漘暑煩囂，爰譜俚詞寄感。</p>

<h3>銀色之夢（上）</h3>
<p>— 辛士筆錄</p>
<p>—銀星李紅小姐口述—</p>
<p>編者介紹：李紅，粤人，現年十八歲，因會旅居北方甚久，操國語極流利。往歲投身銀幕，主演「初戀」，一舉成名，所有作品，雖僅演過「情天血淚」「慾魔」「林冲」等四部，但巳芳譽美茂，藝事日進，早在影壇上獲得很優越的地位了。</p>
<p>三年以前，哦常做着銀色的白日之夢。在學校裏讀書之外，一心一意就只憧憬着想耍試嘗銀幕風味；眞覺可笑得很，我確是位標準的影迷。</p>
<p>在一個適當機會之下，我是眞的實現了夢境，而開始徒事銀燈工作了；到現在，這生活就如做夢一般，巳經度過了兩個年頭；然而，它究竟是怎麼一種風味呢？</p>
<p>試頭說起</p>
<p>一九三六年間，我在南京金陵大學講書，是理化科二年級生。當時，國營的中央電影塲爲籌攝「密電碼」片招考演員；自己就爲企求夢境的實現而前去應考了。結果雖害「有志竟成」，幸被錄取；但以格於身材不高，和男王角高占非君這大個子不很相配的關係，在錄取以後，仍然沒有上攝塲去拍戲。</p>
<p>試演話劇</p>
<p>「中電」裹有幾位同事，這時發起組織「中國戲劇學會」，表演話劇；我因一時無戲拍演，也就樂於加入，希望多得一些經騐。第一决排演「雷雨」，四鳳一角是由我承乏的。這角色從頭至尾，不得休歇，表演極爲繁重；我的體質旣不很好，那時又値抱恙未痊；同伴們都很担心，以爲至多敷衍兩塲，決沒有持久的可能。誰知道「雷雨」連演一月，我却愈演愈覺興奮，演得病也完全沒有了。許多人爲此給我打趣。。『你　是生就要來幹這事業的。」眞不錯，我就從此做定這麽一個勞工了。</p>
<p>初賞風味</p>
<p>當再「雷雨」上演的時候。藝華公司適有主事人在塲看戲，承他　賞，說我頗可拍戲；因此經人介紹，洽談成事。等到「雷兩」一月演畢，我便匆匆到滬，投進銀色圈來。當時「初戀片上塲拍演，起先以爲未必如何煩難；不料初嘗風味，大出意表；而心裏越是發急，戲却越難演好；ＮＧ鏡頭眞拍得多極了，最有趣而莫明其妙的事，是一塲睡在床上閉下眼睛的表演，無論怎樣拍來拍去，總是沒法子把它拍好；不知道是不是燈光太强烈的關係，眼睛想要使它閉攏，它却越發張大起來；直到現在爲止，道類表演依然無法閉限，仍然只能把它設法避免，或改拍背影完事，這眞弄它不懂，可怪之至。</p>
<h3>李紅近影</h3>
<h3>潮州戲之我觀</h3>
<p>— 世珍</p>
<p>平常時候潮州戲，在上海是沒有的，隔了三四年就來了這麽一决，所以它能吸收了許多潮州觀客，它的價目並不低於普通的平劇，（潮州戲的價目大槪一元左右）但潮州人對於故鄕的戲是多末渴望啊！</p>
<p>這决來的是「老三正順香班，」在潮州是很有名望的，在三四年前曾經來過一次，當轉賣座之盛是打破當年來潮州戲的紀綠”然而這一次確不及上一次了，班裏的藝員也沒有上次裹齊，嗓音，做工，扮相都差，最可惜的，就是當年　正牌小生蔡永聲在從前每次上演都能博好，嗓音旣淸　曼妙，作派叉風流倜儻，自返里後即倒嗓，現在竟淪爲班底了，豈不可惜！現在懸正牌的靑衣，欽文其嗓雖高，做工却生硬尙不如翁炳林，（靑衣）其餘可取者如柯錦香，林潤秋，黃吳城等。</p>
<p>劇情方面雖然有幾齣是合乎時代的，但是大都是很猥褻的，並且是很不通的，這就是潮州戲最大的缺點，最後我寄語，「老三正順香班」，努力的擇取有民族意議，與合乎時代的劇本。（却酬）</p>
<h3>籬邊偶語（下）</h3>
<p>— 迂堂</p>
<p>我起初以爲黃金院子小，攏音，用菊朋那種敲金戞玉的嗓子唱，必能會好，那知一連聽了幾次，還不免失望，有時非用全神貫注，就會連一個字都聽不出；原因還是爲了菊朋的刻意求工，他很費力的把每一個字都用腦後音迸將出來，却叉把全神貫注在使「弄」那些纖「巧」的小腔，他旣沒有充沛的底氣，於是字和腔都無法送達遠處，加上陪襯的那把胡琴，音色非常機弱，越想追隨吻合，越顯得笨重累贅，聽了使人坐立不安。試想菊朋的玩意，除了字和腔之外，剩下的還有些什麽呢，論他的扮相身段，除了少數迷戀於他的　有古趣之外，那　　頭　腦形同提綫戲的神情，每一塲都要引起一陣開笑。有一件我要爲他抖屈的，就是菊朋的佳盧沒有人能聽得到，而他所能博得的幾個滿堂好，却正是他的最不堪入耳的幾，個貧腔。</p>
<p>曹空城計跑坡洪羊洞都是菊朋的傑作，也是我所熟聽的劇，先輩典型，心儀已久，不敢下隻字批評，允其對於他的無一字無來歷，更所欽佩，可是對於他的無一腔不機巧，我始終認爲是一種惡劣的轉變。菊朋或許以爲藉此可以增高他「眼前」的聲望，但是相反的這樣下去，勢將影響他將來的地位的。黃金的連塲客滿，是人們迷戀於菊朋早年幾張優秀唱片的結果，而不是來「看」今日台上的菊朋的。許多人喜歡附庸風雅，賞菊東籬，他們未必一定全能領略得菊的佳處。</p>
<p>蘇少卿先生聽了菊朋空城的賊」，洪羊洞的「閒」，遍體舒暢，以爲縱使全劇都糟，即此兩字，亦可過癮，這是一種幽默。也是藝人的偏見，不足以語俗子的。末了，他說還有千言萬語，以一吐爲快，我在渴望着拜讀這篇大文，一定可以搔着不少癢處。菊朋對於舊劇劇劇的Knowledge非常豐富，他會向我表示，打算寫些東西，供諸同好，傳之後世，八年來爲了懶，料想未着一字，蘇先生據說他的「姻士披里純」，快要按捺不住了，我希望他不要也爲了懶而流產才好。因爲他的文章，定可給菊朋的藝術來一個確定的估價的。</p>
<h3>鐵嗓鋼喉說樂弟</h3>
<p>— 劉正鵠</p>
<p>提起仇樂弟那個不知，誰人不曉她是坤伶祭酒孟小小小冬的妹妹，名教師仇月祥的姪女，不獨家學淵源而且佳嗓天賦，一曲高歌，聲驚四座。一在晚近坤伶隊裏，眞稱得起出類拔萃的了。她現隸時代劇塲，已屬有頂共賞，有口碑。小妮子以往因涉世朱深，猶不免購矜之氣，今則一洗前態，無論待人接物，莫不彬彬有慶，以故捧塲者，亦大有人在，可見騫上唱戲，玩意固須貨眞價實，而人緣亦不可不加注意。星期夜，貼上天裏及全本捉放（從公堂起宿店止），在同時運唱雙韻累工戲，非但現時坤伶中，不易多得，所以上天豎普出場，裹下即不約而同，來一個滿堂彩，樂弟於是夕，亦格外冒上，歌來抑揚頓挫，無不響遏行雲，韻味醇厚，三年三月三日三時三刻三分大段快三眼一氣呵成，似懸崖瀑布，一瀉千里，始終不露力竭聲嘶之象，允覺難能可貴；捉放之聽他言慢板，宿店時聽譙樓原板，甜潤爽澈，如珠走玉盤，全劇佳腔迭出，聆之足以迥腸盪氣，萬慮全消，裏下幾一句一彩，故稱之爲鐵嗓鋼喉，洵非過譽；即做表亦灑脫可觀，所惜咬字尙欠遒勁，口白微帶雌音，未免美中不足，然瑕不掩瑜，吾人固不應過事苛責，設假以時日，不難臻爐火純靑之候，總之樂弟是一塊新發掘出來的美玉，切磋琢磨，固有待於良匠，而勤討精硏，是則則則有望於樂弟，樂弟其勉之。</p>

<p>這幾年來，唱來唱去的總不外乎馬連良·譚富英·楊實森·以及小號馬連良李盛藻·小號李盛藻沙世鑫……，人人都知道上海人有個愛新鮮的老毛病，所謂「新厕所開張都要香三天」，這無怪大家全覺得上述諸人太貧太不稀奇了。菊朋十年未曾來滬了，論他的資格和班輩吧，在上述諸人中他可算學譚的老祖長；况他售價叉較馬譚低廉，同時叉帶來了一位新露頭角的侯玉蘭，一個老變新的鬚生，和一位嶄嶄新的坤角花衫，於是就把上海人給轟動啦。再加以黃金宣傳得法，每日報章上刋有訂期半月等字樣，因此看客們就愈形擁擠了。據好多人說：菊朋自登台日起，在唱·作·甩弔毛·等等的時候，幾乎無日不得「塲笑」。那天「二進宮」裏居然也得了一决滿堂的塲笑，（塲笑，乃含有原諒性之譏笑，與倒彩·打通·不同。）那一句的尾聲應當向上翻，但是菊朋因爲氣弱，有點黃腔，勞髴像留聲機的法條鬆了，所以得個大塲笑。然而霎時叉即鴉雀無聲，這可以證明台下的看客們都很能原諒他的衰頽之像，大家因憐生愛，就不忍使他太難堪了。故而這一决菊朋之紅，（以賣座而論）實在還是得力於「老牌子」三字。</p>
<p>要講到現存譚派鬚生裹可以賣老牌子的，就連叔岩·小培·在內，雖也都賣不過貫盛習的大爺貫大元。民國初年老譚·劉鴻聲·猶未謝絕歌壇的時候，大元就已成名了。他的年齡雖較叉宸小個八九歲，然而他兩人享名的先後，是差不多的。所以三十年前「老謀得利」和「百代公司」都曾灌過他們的「哭靈牌」「盤關」等這些片子，由此可以證明他若非享名甚早，那是決不會被唱片公司的請他灌音的。至於他自幼習藝的經過，待我的略叙述如後。—（六四）—</p>

<h3>Progress of Chinese Troops in Southern Hubei and Northern Hunan; Hanyi Road Expected to Seize Yanmenkou and Yangzi Soon; Japanese Troops Retreat from Yanglousi Area, Nearby Strongholds Recaptured; Cantonese Troops Launch Another Fierce Attack on Chaoan City, Japanese Troops Land in Shanwei</h3>
<p>Pingjiang: Chinese troops attacking the Nanlinqiao area in southern Hubei have made continuous progress in recent days. On the 17th, part of the Chinese army thoroughly destroyed the highway near Nanlinqiao in more than ten places. The main force then crossed the highway and advanced towards Tingsiqiao. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo: On the evening of the 17th, Chinese troops attacked the Japanese army in the Yanglousi and Shuipu area. The Japanese resisted stubbornly at Luomaqiao, Kangwangqiao and other places. The Chinese army bravely charged, and after two hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army was overwhelmed, abandoning more than 30 bodies and retreating. The Chinese army has recaptured these areas and is currently advancing. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Yichang: The Chinese army launched an attack from the front of the Hanyi Road. A certain unit has advanced to Liujiaji, north of Yanmenkou, and encountered the Japanese army several times along the way, resulting in fierce battles. Many Japanese soldiers were killed and many supplies were captured. Currently, the Chinese army is taking advantage of the victory to pursue the retreating Japanese army to the north. In the Zhongxiang area, the Chinese army is approaching the outskirts of Yangzi. There is a lot of panic within the Japanese army, and they have no ability to resist. Yangzi is expected to be taken soon, and Zhongxiang is essentially surrounded by the Chinese side. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo: On the evening of the 18th, a certain advanced detachment of the Chinese army launched a multi-pronged attack on Yanglousi on the border of Hunan and Hubei. After fierce fighting until about 3 a.m. the next morning, Yanglousi was recaptured. At dawn, Japanese reinforcements from Xianning counterattacked, and the Chinese army withdrew safely. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Liuhuang: On the 18th, the Chinese army launched a second major counterattack, fiercely attacking Chaoan City, with forces launching from the southeast and west, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese army defending the city. The Chinese army killed many Japanese soldiers, with most of them wounded or killed. The Japanese then set fire to civilian houses to obstruct the advance of the Chinese army, while fleeing towards the northwest of Zhaohulu Mountain and Jinshan. The Chinese army is concentrating its forces to attack. Another main force of the Chinese army advanced southward, reaching the area of Fuyang Gezhou, cutting off the connection between the Japanese army in that area and Shantou. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Xingning: Ten Japanese planes took turns bombing various places in Haifeng on the morning of the 20th, dropping bombs like rain, and machine guns swept back and forth non-stop. Then, several Japanese warships shelled Shanwei, launching dozens of motorboats carrying hundreds of Japanese soldiers, forcibly landing. The Chinese garrison immediately resisted bravely, and after several hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, and the Chinese army also made heroic sacrifices. Eventually, due to the rapid arrival of Japanese reinforcements, by 2 p.m., all the Chinese fortifications were destroyed by the concentrated fire of the Japanese warships. In addition, with no defensible terrain on the coast, they had no choice but to retreat slightly to more favorable terrain to continue their resistance. The Japanese army is now advancing towards Yaowei, 25 miles from Haifeng, and Chinese reinforcements are heading separately to block them. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhaoqing: At dawn on the 19th, more than 300 Japanese and puppet troops from Sanshui and Xinan launched a fierce attack on Yangmei along the Sishui "Siihui to Sanshui" and Luxi "Lupao to Xinan" roads, encountering Chinese guerrilla teams. After two hours of fierce fighting, they were unable to withstand and collapsed. For the past ten days, the Japanese and puppet troops have been disrupting the Hualuxi line and have been severely defeated. This is their third defeat. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>Wengyuan: At dusk on the 17th, more than 200 Japanese troops invaded Chengzhang County again. The Chinese team tried their best to resist. Then, the Japanese army sent reinforcements, and the Chinese army suffered many casualties. Chenghai was recaptured by the Japanese. (20th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) After the fall of Changzhi, part of the Japanese army reached the area south of Changzhi at dawn on the 14th, and was blocked by the Chinese army. The Japanese army in Yicheng seemed to have the intention of crossing the Qin River and invading Jincheng Gaoping. More than 1,000 Japanese troops who invaded westward from Nakamura (southeast of Yicheng) have been ambushed by the Chinese army at Baihualing since the 13th, retreated to Maweigou, and most of them detoured to the vicinity of Yujingshan northwest of Dongfeng, and are engaged in fierce fighting with the Chinese army. In recent days, more than 5,000 Japanese troops have gathered near Qinshui, busy preparing rear transportation, and planning to continue their advance. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) The Qinshui area, Yancheng fell on the morning of the 15th, and subsequent troops increased to more than 3,000. On the 17th, they forcibly crossed east in the vicinity of Zhenwang (east of Qinshui) and Runcheng Town (east of Yangcheng). By the evening, more than 1,000 people had crossed, and some were continuing to invade eastward along the Qin Gao and Yang Jin highways. More than 3,000 Japanese troops from Jingchangzi invaded Hengshui Village from the west on the 14th, and have now penetrated into Nankongtan. In the northeast and east of Qinshui, the Chinese troops are confronting the Japanese army separately in the Qinshui area and on the south side. (19th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) Three to four thousand Japanese troops from Zhangma and Nakamura invaded eastward from the 14th and were intercepted by a certain unit of the Chinese army near Nanyang Village. Until the 17th, the Chinese University launched a counterattack, selecting many daredevils to rush directly into the village and recapture Nanyang Village Jiaokou "northwest of Dongfeng" in one fell swoop. The remnants of the Japanese army collapsed towards Dongfeng. The Chinese army took advantage of the Japanese army's unstable foothold and pursued them near Dongfeng, fighting fiercely until noon, occupying the line of Tianjiazhuang "southeast of Dongfeng" and the upper and lower Lotus Mountains "south of Dongfeng", cutting the Japanese army into several sections and continuing to encircle and annihilate them. More than 60 Japanese troops from Qinyang advanced from Daxiakou Village "north of Lanche Town" to the line of Huajian Shiling "south of Lanche" on the 16th, attempting to occupy Jincheng. After being intercepted by a certain unit of the Chinese army in the middle, the fighting lasted for a day and a night, and is still in stalemate. (19th dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Considers Expanding Loans to China Due to Further Depreciation of Chinese Currency; Amount of Stabilization Fund to Be Increased</h3>
<p>(London) Due to the further depreciation of the Chinese currency, the British Cabinet is considering expanding the £5 million loan to China for the stabilization fund to £10 million. According to financial experts here, if Britain does not continue to support the Chinese currency, Japan's continued monopoly in North China and the Yangtze River basin will proceed smoothly. However, the occurrence of this situation during the British-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo is quite embarrassing for Britain. (19th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The rumor in Shanghai that Song Ziwen, chairman of the Bank of China and former Minister of Finance, will soon hold an important position in the Chinese government has not been confirmed here. Song's secretary declined to comment on the matter when visited by Reuters. Well-informed sources here indicate that this rumor is a hope, as the legal tender can be stabilized if Mr. Song resumes his government position. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Financial News commented on the recent depreciation of the Chinese currency today, mentioning the question of whether Britain should continue to support it, stating that the stability of the Chinese currency is undoubtedly in the interests of British trade. Chancellor of the Exchequer Sir John Simon had confirmed this policy just a few days ago. The rapid exhaustion of the original £10 million fund may prove to be the cause of the current situation, as the foreign exchange obtained from exports is now gradually falling into the hands of the Japanese. A large portion of the original fund has actually been handed over to Japan, and another large portion has been used to facilitate foreign exchange speculation and the export of capital. Although this second loophole has now been closed, it is still necessary to implement stricter controls on imports to ensure that they are not paid for in Japanese currency. If this can be done, then continued assistance may achieve its purpose, as the situation of the Chinese currency has not yet fallen into chaos. Therefore, it is hoped that a solution can be found in the midst of the difficulties. Judging from the critical tone of the Japanese side, if the British side retreats slightly during these Tokyo negotiations, it will be regarded as a sign of British weakness.

<p>(Kunming) According to a public announcement by local government offices, the Kunming Municipal Government will be directly under the jurisdiction of the Yunnan Provincial Government in the future. A plan to have Kunming, as a special municipality, under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan has recently been under consideration. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Arita Listens to Military's Breath, British-Japanese Talks on the Verge of Rupture; Many Discrepancies in Opinions Between the Two Sides; Future Depends on Today's Negotiations; Ambassador Craig Sends Secretary to Tokyo</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to sources in diplomatic circles, the British-Japanese conference is in danger of breaking down today because the Japanese side insists on discussing general abstract principles before discussing the Tianjin issue. During yesterday's talks, Arita left the meeting room from time to time to exchange views with representatives of the military, and therefore firmly insisted that Britain must recognize its past attitude in China, which was not a neutral attitude, and must guarantee that it will cooperate with Japan in the future. However, Craig replied that his government has not been given the power to admit mistakes and provide guarantees, so the talks have reached a deadlock. Unless the attitudes of both sides change, the talks will inevitably fail. It is said that Craig is extremely pessimistic about future talks, and the British side has prepared for the breakdown of the conference and the actions after the breakdown, such as the withdrawal of expatriates from Tianjin, etc. (20th Associated Press dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Kokumin Shimbun expressed dissatisfaction with the general discussion of the background of the Tianjin situation, saying that the general issues should include Britain's attitude towards the whole of China, not just Tianjin. The Miyako Shimbun said that the future of the Tokyo talks is bleak and there is little hope. The Nichi Nichi Shimbun said that the negotiations are now almost at a standstill. (20th Reuters dispatch) Foreign Minister Arita met with Prime Minister Hiranuma today to report on his meeting with British Ambassador Craig. According to Japanese sources, qualified Japanese observers claim that the Japanese government now firmly demands that Britain must recognize Japan's military, political, economic and other measures in the war zone. Therefore, the British-Japanese talks seem to be on the verge of rupture. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the negotiations between the British and Japanese authorities in Tokyo, the Foreign Office received a detailed report from Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie and will issue further instructions today to enable the Ambassador to continue talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita tomorrow. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is known today that Alan, the secretary of British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, arrived in Tokyo on the 10th of this month to assist Ambassador Craig in the British-Japanese conference in the capacity of advisor. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, Japanese newspapers commented on yesterday's meeting between the British Ambassador and the Japanese Foreign Minister, saying that judging from the situation of yesterday's talks, many differences of opinion have become clearer. It is said that the British Ambassador has frankly accepted some points from Foreign Minister Arita, but has expressed strong opposition to other points that he believes affect Britain's prestige. Therefore, tomorrow's negotiations are extremely important, and the success of the Tianjin incident conference depends on the extent of Britain's concessions to the various demands made by the Japanese side to the British Ambassador. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the various requirements are as follows: (1) Britain recognizes the state of war within China; (2) Britain ceases all actions that are hostile to Japan under the pretext of protecting its interests; (3) Britain does not obstruct the means that the Japanese army considers necessary to maintain peace, order and survival. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the Tokyo "Nichi Nichi Shimbun," British Ambassador to Japan Sir Robert Craigie stated the following three points during his second talk with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita yesterday: (1) Britain is willing to consider all Japanese demands related to the Sino-Japanese conflict, but must avoid the impression that Britain is surrendering to Japan; (2) Britain will consider the changed situation in North China and decide on measures to resolve various disputes; (3) No unilateral demands should be made in the current negotiations. Foreign Minister Arita also stated the following two points to the British Ambassador: (1) Japan demands that Britain cease all activities that hinder Japan's military activities in China; (2) When discussing basic principles, Japan will not consider any compromise plans or mutual concessions, but requires a clear "yes" or "no" from the British side.

<h3>British MP Demands Economic Sanctions Against Japan; Chamberlain Meets US Ambassador</h3>
<p>(London) During the meeting of the House of Commons this afternoon, Conservative MP Sir Milner Ward asked about the issue of Japan's discrimination against British commercial interests in China, saying, "Japan's actions to hinder British commercial interests in China are becoming more and more serious. The government should notify the Japanese authorities and inform them that if the blockade of the British concession in Tianjin is not lifted and the discrimination against British trade in China is not stopped, Britain will take economic measures against Japan. I wonder if the government has this intention." Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler replied, "British-Japanese negotiations have begun in Tokyo, and the government hopes to resolve the various outstanding issues concerning the Tianjin incident through negotiations." (19th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler declared in the House of Commons yesterday that the key to resolving the various outstanding issues between Britain and Japan, as well as the issue of Britain taking economic retaliatory measures against Japan, lies entirely with Japan. (20th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Cabinet discussed the negotiations in Tokyo between Ambassador to Japan Craigie and Japanese Foreign Minister Arita at its weekly meeting today. Informed sources have expressed neither optimism nor pessimism about this. Most people say that the negotiations have just begun and it is difficult to predict the outcome. (19th Havas dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yongding and Sanggan Rivers Flooded, Causing Disaster</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin news: The Yongding River has been experiencing mountain torrents for days, and Lianggezhuang suddenly collapsed, with Anci, Yongqing, and Wuqing all flooded. The water outside Anci is six feet deep. In addition, the Sanggan River overflowed, and the suburbs of Hunyuan City in northern Shanxi were submerged, with 700 deaths and injuries.

<h3>Order on Yunnan-Burma Highway Good; Impressions of US Representative</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Arnold, a representative of the American Motor Company, recently arrived in Chongqing after traveling for twelve days on the new Yunnan-Burma Highway in the rain. He said that the traffic maintenance on the new highway is better than expected. The Yunnan-Burma Highway Bureau now dispatches teams to patrol the road day and night in sections, so even though it is raining and the soil is collapsing, vehicles are still coming and going. The farmers along the road have all been trained, so when there is a landslide, they can gather hundreds of farmers within two or three hours to clear it completely. The Bureau also has resident labor teams stationed at key stations along the road to prepare for emergencies. The Southwest Transportation Company currently operates 1,000 trucks between Myanmar and Kunming, averaging 60 to 100 tons of cargo per day. After the rainy season, the tonnage is expected to triple. It seems that China can ensure victory in the battle against rain. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong to Implement Compulsory Military Service</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Compulsory Military Service Bill was submitted to the Legislative Council this afternoon. The bill stipulates that British and Chinese men between the ages of 18 and 55 must serve in the military. However, this plan is different from the conscription system known in Britain and elsewhere and is temporarily only applicable to British people. It is heard that the purpose of this case is to create a reserve team that does not hinder the usual work of the British. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Anglo-Japanese Negotiations in Tokyo</h3>
<p>Regarding the Anglo-Japanese negotiations in Tokyo concerning the Tianjin incident, the British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, and the Japanese Foreign Minister, Hachiro Arita, held their first round of talks on the 15th of this month. The content of the talks was not announced, only stating that both sides declared their respective positions. According to a Tokyo dispatch, they held their second round of talks on the morning of the 19th. According to general observations, the current discussion between the British and Japanese sides concerns the scope of the negotiations. From the perspective of public opinion in both countries, Britain only hopes to treat the Japanese blockade of the British concession in Tianjin as a local issue and discuss a solution, attempting to maintain all its interests in Tianjin through a neutral stance. Therefore, it only proposes the extradition of the suspects in the assassination of Cheng Xi-geng and the improvement of concession administration as the basis for negotiations. However, Japan hopes to resolve all Anglo-Japanese disputes in China through these negotiations, demanding that Britain recognize the new situation in the Far East created by Japan. In other words, it is tantamount to demanding that Britain recognize Japan's victory over China. The victory has already been determined, and at the same time, it has already defeated Britain, and Britain should abandon its interests in China. The aims of both sides can truly be said to be poles apart!</p>
<p>To give an example: Party A says I want to buy a base, and Party B says I want to repair a house. These two are fundamentally not about the same business, so how can a deal be reached? But Party A and Party B actually exchange greetings and intend to start bargaining. Isn't this a joke? What Britain and Japan want to resolve is not the same issue. The so-called scope of negotiations has not been determined, but in reality, the issues for negotiation have not been determined. So what is there to negotiate about? Yet negotiations have begun. This is also a joke. Jokes are unfolding one after another, but some people have a different understanding. When the Tokyo negotiations were first announced, Germany, Italy, and Japan all called it the "Munich Conference of the Far East," implying that Britain would inevitably make concessions. This statement exposed their extravagant hopes. Also, because Britain, under the pressure of Japan's military blockade, did not adopt effective resistance measures but instead demanded peaceful negotiations with Japan, it has already made significant concessions in practice.</p>
<p>However, this cannot be regarded as a change in Britain's Far Eastern policy. Britain's Far Eastern policy is a part of its national policy. Any country that possesses an independent national character will never have its national policy changed due to the interference of other countries. Britain will not hastily change its national policy due to Japan's various insults, oppressions, and attacks, just as China's resolute resistance is for the sake of national independence and national character, unwilling to change its own national policy under the oppression of other countries. This can be seen from the British government's repeated declarations, which can lead people to believe that Britain, even in its current difficult situation, will ultimately not change its Far Eastern policy.</p>
<p>Moreover, in terms of realistic interests, Britain also has no possibility of changing its Far Eastern policy. In this round of Japan's war against China, its military target is China, but economically, Britain is also one of its targets. In China's industry and mining, there are many British investments. Most of China's shipping belongs to British merchants, and China's foreign trade is mostly with Britain and its affiliated colonies. If Britain recognizes Japan's so-called "new situation in the Far East," it must abandon these interests in China. Even, in order to satisfy Japan's desire to complete its continental policy, it must withdraw its forces from various places in the Far East. Recently, there was an anti-British movement in Guangzhou to reclaim Kowloon, and leaflets inciting Indians to oppose the British were also discovered in Hong Kong. If Britain's interests in China cannot be protected, it is feared that its influence in other parts of the Far East will also be difficult to maintain. This is not just a matter concerning the prestige of the British Empire.</p>
<p>In this round of negotiations, Japan is in a relatively advantageous position in terms of the situation. Not only do the anti-British movements in Japan and the occupied areas of China demonstrate Japan's capabilities, but Japan's complete prohibition of British economic activities in the occupied areas and its formal and informal blockade of concessions in various places are even more signals hoping for concessions from the British side. If Japan's demand for Britain to "recognize the new situation in the Far East" is only considered in terms of each individual part, it is indeed possible to adopt a tough stance. However, Japan's true intention may not be to hope to completely achieve its goal. The reason for making excessive demands is probably just a kidnapping-style bargaining policy. Its demand that Britain recognize the new situation in the Far East created by Japan single-handedly is a huge bargaining chip. As long as Britain is willing to concede an inch, it will be the basis for Japan to gain a foot of progress, and Japan will also be willing to temporarily end this negotiation. Then, it will implement its consistent policy, treating the clauses in the agreement that are beneficial to Japan as a legal basis and implementing them earnestly. The so-called Shanghai Customs Agreement signed by Britain and Japan last year is an example. Japan used the provisions of the agreement to control the Jianghai Customs, but it has never fulfilled the debts that the agreement stipulated should be paid to Europe and the United States. Japan's policy of gradual encroachment to gradually reduce the influence of various countries in China is a relatively safe method. Therefore, in this negotiation, Japan may not insist that Britain recognize the new situation in the Far East. If Britain makes concessions on other points because Japan will not insist on this point, it will be helping Japan's strategy. We believe that the experienced and prudent British will not fail to see this point and end up falling into a path of chronic self-destruction!</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Retracts Japanese Protest, Soviet-Japanese Relations Worsen Again, Soviet Union Plans to Abolish Japanese Rights in Northern Sakhalin, Japanese Naval Authorities Claim They Still Have the Capacity to Deal With It</h3>
<p>(Moscow) According to sources close to the Foreign Affairs Committee, the Soviet government is currently considering canceling Japanese special rights in northern Sakhalin. If this materializes, then the Japanese "observers" on the island may be eliminated. (Haidao Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to Japanese sources here last night, the dispute between the Soviet Union and Japan regarding oil and coal rights in northern Sakhalin is more serious than the border war between "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia. The Soviet court sentenced the Japanese transferee to a fine of 374,000 rubles on July 11 for failing to fulfill its obligations to Soviet workers. Japan protested to the Soviet government and demanded a reply by noon yesterday, which was rejected by the Soviet Union. The deadline for paying the fine expires at midnight today. Japanese sources with good information claim that if the Japanese company does not pay the fine tonight, the company will face the danger of being confiscated by the Soviet Union. The Japanese government believes that this dispute is related to Japan's prestige, and Japan may be forced to take "serious measures" after the deadline to maintain its prestige. (20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Japanese Navy Department, Vice Admiral Kanazawa, issued a statement saying that the Japanese naval authorities are increasingly concerned about the Soviet Union's continued threats and attacks on Japan's fishing and coal rights in northern Sakhalin. If the Soviet Union believes that Japan is currently too busy dealing with the China incident, then it is mistaken. Japan is by no means without the capacity to pay attention to Sakhalin. (Haidao Telegraph, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Navy Ministry stated today that the Japanese Navy is extremely concerned about the Soviet government's unreasonable oppression of Japanese fishermen in the North Sea and Japanese oil and coal concession rights in northern Sakhalin. The Soviet Union and Japan are currently conducting serious diplomatic negotiations on this matter. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Tianjin Concession, Blockade Procedures to Be Intensified, Film Actors and Actresses Banned from Entering</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Tianjin Police Bureau has reportedly ordered the police to prohibit film actors and actresses from entering the concession, which is part of the procedure to strengthen the blockade of the Tianjin concession. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) An English-language newspaper published here this morning commented on the Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo, saying that Britain does not need to make concessions to Japan on fundamental issues in this negotiation. If Japan does not abandon its policy of forcing Britain to cooperate with Japan in its aggression against China, then the Tokyo conference can be broken off at any time. If the interests on which Britain's rise and fall depend must still be protected, then the Chamberlain government cannot tolerate a second Munich failure. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Mengzi Customs, Restrictions on Imports, Rejection of Luxury Goods</h3>
<p>(Kunming) The Mengzi Customs has been ordered to reject luxury goods from entering the country from today. All foreign tobacco and alcohol, cosmetics, paper, clothing, silk goods, cotton and wool fabrics, canned food, seafood, sugar and vegetables, lace, buttons, toys, musical instruments, bird's nest, etc., are all on the banned list. However, it is still questionable how effective this regulation will be. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Political Parties Actively Inciting Anti-British Sentiment, Encouraging Chinese Employees Hired by the British to Resign, Japanese Residents in Pingri Hold Mass Meeting, Mobs in Jinan Attack British Industries</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The New People's Society, a political party organized by the Japanese, is currently using all methods to incite anti-British sentiment. Its most recent actions include publishing a half-page advertisement, asking Chinese people employed by the British to resign immediately, and Chinese landlords to take back all houses rented to the British. Those who do not comply will be regarded as "disrupting the efforts to establish a new order in East Asia" and will be dealt with accordingly, and their families will be punished. This intimidation has already had an impact on more restless Chinese employees. At the same time, newspapers controlled by the Japanese continue to attack British church schools, accusing them of "cultural aggression." According to Japanese sources, "after the Chinese authorities in Kaifeng issued an ultimatum," 21 British people in the area left the country on July 17. Japanese residents in Beiping held a mass meeting late yesterday and passed a resolution to "expel the British from Asia." (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese sources reported that mobs in Jinan attacked British industries. It is said that a large number of Chinese mobs entered the office of a British shipping company yesterday and destroyed all the furniture and equipment inside. When two other British firms were attacked by the mobs, they quickly closed their doors and windows, "but there was no major damage. At that time, Japanese military police arrived and dispersed the mobs." Japanese sources also said that six British residents in Kaifeng who were threatened by local Chinese authorities and ordered to leave the country on July 19 are currently preparing to go to the coast. However, this statement has not been confirmed. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese here plan to organize a large-scale boycott of British goods movement from today to threaten British merchants who are already unable to move. The method is that the New People's Society, directed by the Japanese, will organize an anti-British boycott committee and send inspectors to be stationed at the entrances and exits of the concession to prevent British goods from entering and leaving the concession, and to carry out publicity campaigns to boycott British goods, advising shops not to sell British goods. If there are losses, they will be compensated by the "official". A disciplinary committee will be established to punish those who knowingly violate the rules. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, the Tianjin Anti-British Movement Committee has now drafted measures to boycott British goods, including the appointment of inspectors and special agents to promote the boycott. The task of the inspectors is to urge all shops and warehouses to stop selling British goods. However, the committee will compensate for the trade lost by the shops. It is reported that the committee has suggested organizing a special control agency for the sale of British goods. (Reuters, 20th)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong's Trade with China Greatly Reduced</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to official government statistics, Hong Kong's trade with China in the first six months of 1939 has been greatly reduced, with a total reduction of 100 million yuan, mostly due to the Japanese seizure of Guangzhou and Jiangmen and restrictions on the Chinese coast. However, the impact of the occupation of Shantou is not yet included. (Reuters, 20th)</p>

<h3>Issue of Amending US Neutrality Act, Roosevelt Still Plans to Take Action, Only Hoping That Europe Will Not Go to War Within Months, President's Debate with Isolationists</h3>
<p>(Washington) Supporters of the government are excited again today, believing that President Roosevelt will eventually take action on the Neutrality Act to align it with his foreign policy. It is also clear that the Republican Party does not dare to use the issue of neutrality as a point of contention between the parties. Government circles feel that if the President presents the case to the people in a calm and impartial tone, he will undoubtedly gain approval. Senator Vandenberg, the designated Republican candidate in the presidential election, declined to comment. It is said that Vandenberg does not want to involve the neutrality issue in the election campaign, because the President's foreign policy has won the support of a majority of people who do not belong to any party and the majority of important newspapers. Congressional representatives have different opinions on the President's decision to abandon the struggle to discuss the Neutrality Act in this congressional session. Many supporters of the government believe that although the President will give speeches to the public and explain the Neutrality Act issue during his tour of the West, he will not engage in a propaganda campaign for his policy, as President Wilson did for the League of Nations. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to political figures, the meeting that President Roosevelt convened with Vice President Garner, Secretary of State Hull, and the leaders of the Democratic and Republican parties in the Senate at the White House last night was extremely complicated. President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull had a verbal battle with Republican Senator Borah. Borah said that his views on the European situation were very different from those of the President and the Secretary of State. Then, many different opinions were expressed and questioned each other until Vice President Garner spoke. Garner then asked Senate Democratic Leader Barkley if he was confident that the Senate would overturn the decision of the Foreign Relations Committee and submit the Neutrality Act issue to discussion in this session. Barkley replied in the negative. President Roosevelt then asked Barkley to publicly declare in the Senate that the Senate was responsible for the Neutrality Act issue. Borah immediately protested, saying that the Senate was originally responsible. "Fortunately, the United States is not ruled by people like Hitler." Another Republican Senator, Austin, said that if war breaks out in Europe, the Senate can quickly revoke the arms embargo clause. At this point, President Roosevelt expressed his intention to give multiple speeches, publicly raising the Neutrality Act issue in order to appeal directly to public opinion. Borah also replied that he was not afraid of the President's strategy. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Presidential Secretary Early said that if a European war breaks out during the congressional recess, the President will convene a special session of all members of Congress to decide on the actions that the United States should take, and said, "I am sure that President Roosevelt will pray to Congress with unprecedented sincerity that no new crisis will occur in Europe before the reconvening," but according to recent intelligence from Europe, there is a high probability of a crisis occurring within the next few months. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt's decision to postpone the discussion of the Neutrality Act amendment was recently commented on by the New York Times and the New York Evening Post. Both said that if war breaks out in Europe, the United States will definitely assist the democratic countries in resisting the dictatorial countries. The New York Times stated, "To put it bluntly, President Roosevelt's failure this time is enough to encourage the aggressive countries to use war and the threat of war as a means of conquest, because if the military equipment and ammunition needed by a certain country for legitimate defense during wartime are supplied by the United States, it must wait until Congress reconvenes in January of next year before there is a legal way to implement it. Does the American people want to maintain peace or can they maintain peace in a large-scale European war? Regarding the first level, there is no doubt. Regarding the second level, we can answer with considerable confidence that the majority of the American people all believe that if the European countries are caught in the vortex of war, it will be difficult for the United States to stay out of it." The New York Evening Post agreed, briefly saying, "Senator Borah's victory yesterday was a reality, but if war breaks out in Europe within a few months, then Borah's victory will be in vain. The American nation will have to deal with various practical problems at that time, and the disputes of the past few weeks will definitely not have any impact on the solution of these practical problems. This can be asserted." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The current Congress will announce its recess in two weeks and will reconvene in January of next year. As soon as Congress adjourns, President Roosevelt will set off on a tour of the country, giving multiple speeches along the way to guide public opinion and make it clear that the Neutrality Act urgently needs to be amended. A White House spokesman recently said that President Roosevelt believes that the international situation may become tense before Congress reconvenes, so he retains the right, in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution, to convene Congress to hold a temporary session if he believes it is necessary for the international situation, in order to amend the Neutrality Act. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>New Guns Installed on British Military Aircraft</h3>
<p>(London) British destroyers and fighter planes have now been equipped with motorcycle guns. Britain has always kept the new equipment secret, and the outside world initially knew nothing about it until Aviation Minister Sir Kingsley Wood made a public announcement in the House of Commons that fighter guns were already being manufactured on a large scale in this country. The guns are being manufactured in large quantities in new British armories and were developed from the Hispano-Suiza motorcycle gun. The gun was originally manufactured in France, and the motorcycle gun is built into the aircraft engine and can fire one-pound shells at the same speed as a machine gun, nine hundred rounds per minute. The gun's magazine can hold armor-piercing shells, explosive shells, tracer shells, and signal shells. (Associated Press, 20th)</p>
<h3>US-China Bill Stalled, Discussions Abound in the United States</h3>
<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt decided to postpone the discussion of the Neutrality Act amendment issue, Senator Pittman, Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said that the government will definitely gain increasingly strong support from public opinion for the Neutrality Act plan, so it will be easier to pass when the case is discussed after Congress reconvenes in January of next year. "If any other government takes aggressive action during the US congressional recess, the attitude of US congressmen will naturally change. If a major war breaks out as a result, President Roosevelt will definitely convene Congress to hold a temporary session to discuss the Neutrality Act issue. At that time, the government will also ask Congress to transfer the necessary powers to be able to respond to the situation." Florida Democratic Senator Pepper also said that he agreed that the Neutrality Act issue depended on public opinion. Rhode Island Democratic Senator Green said, "Postponing the discussion of the Neutrality Act issue until the next session of Congress is a major blow to peace-loving people in the country and peace-loving countries around the world." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt decided to postpone the submission of the Neutrality Act issue to the next session of Congress for discussion, observers recently commented, saying that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull both believed that a crisis would occur in the European situation in a short period of time. If the United States could revoke the arms embargo clause at this time, it might have a good impact and eliminate the scourge of war. However, isolationists such as Senator Borah believe that the claim that a European war is about to break out is an exaggeration, so they advocate that it is not appropriate to take action at the moment. In short, this decision was made because public opinion was not fully prepared and failed to urge Congress to pass the plan proposed by the government. This is also admitted by Democrats. As for the reason why members of Congress opposed the President, the root cause lies in domestic political issues, not party issues. This can be seen from the fact that the arguments put forward by Secretary of State Hull are exactly the same as those made by former Republican Secretary of State Stimson when the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred in 1931. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt decided not to ask Congress to discuss the Neutrality Act amendment issue during this session, US newspapers all recognized that the psychological impact of this matter was more serious than the actual impact, and feared that the totalitarian countries would regard it as encouragement and resume their aggression. The New York World-Telegram, known for its opposition to the "New Deal," also published an article this morning, warning German Führer Hitler not to misunderstand the attitude of the United States. It said, "The power of US public opinion can make Congress reconvene quickly and revoke the arms embargo clause. Führer Hitler must understand this before instigating a European war." In addition, political commentator Lippmann raised several questions to the State Department: (1) Do we want Singapore to belong to Britain or Japan? (2) Do we want the British fleet to withdraw from the Far East and the rubber, various metals, and kerosene produced by British India and the Dutch East Indies to become the assets of Zhou Xin country? (3) Do we want to sit idly by and watch the British Isles become a tiny dot on the world map, the British fleet being sunk or captured by Germany, and watch Hitler and Mussolini become the masters of the two continents of Mo Fei and exert pressure on Latin America? "If the above questions can be answered, then the whole problem can be clarified." (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Convenes Refugee Relief Conference, Invites Representatives from Britain, France, Brazil, and Other Countries to Discuss in Washington</h3>
<p>(London) After the International Committee for the Relief of Refugees held a meeting here this afternoon, it issued a formal communiqué, which briefly stated that US President Roosevelt has invited representatives from Britain, France, Brazil, Argentina, and other countries to go to Washington in early September of this year to hold a conference to discuss international refugee relief issues. In addition, the chairman of the committee, British representative Lord Winterton, proposed that the principle decided at last year's Evian Conference, namely, that governments should not directly assist refugees with cash, be modified. Regarding this point, representatives from other countries said that they needed to consult with their respective governments for a solution. According to reports, the International Committee for the Relief of Refugees is currently studying the transfer of Jews to various places in South America, Dutch Guiana, British Guiana, Central America, Santo Domingo, and British Northern Rhodesia in Africa. To date, private organizations in various countries have donated a total of £15 million for the relief of Jews, of which £10 million is in cash and the rest is in goods. (Havas, 19th)</p>

(Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(New York) Yu De, the former chairman of the American Aircraft Manufacturers Association, recently submitted a report on the global aviation market situation, stating that in 1938, Germany and Italy sold more aircraft and aviation materials to eighteen countries than the United States. In addition to selling on credit and signing barter agreements, the governments of the Axis powers also sent aviation groups to visit various countries. They also sold more aircraft and aviation materials in six Latin American countries than the United States. However, in terms of total exports, the United States still ranked first, with total exports of aircraft engines and various parts totaling $68,209,050. Next was Germany, with $27,0183,501; third was the United Kingdom, with $26,501,340 (Note: Germany surpassed the United Kingdom, making it the first runner-up); fourth was Italy, with $8,821,493; and fifth was France, with $3,752,208. The combined total for Germany and Italy was $36,004,994, while the combined total for the United Kingdom and France was only $30,253,548. Germany's exports of aircraft and parts to Japan were worth $4,303,544. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>*The Times* Comments on Anglo-American Goods Exchange Agreement</h3>
<p>(London) *The Times* commented on the Anglo-American goods exchange agreement, stating that the International Rubber Regulation Committee will discuss the matter at its meeting next Tuesday. The implementation of this agreement will require the release of more rubber, so the issue of the quota permitted for the last quarter of this year will inevitably arise. Although rubber producers are willing to cooperate with each other in practical ways to create a reasonable emergency reserve, they may demand guarantees to prevent any abnormalities in labor or market conditions. According to the Anglo-American goods exchange agreement, the United States will supply 600,000 bales of raw cotton to the United Kingdom in exchange for rubber of equivalent value.

According to the agreement, France guarantees to export to Germany the total amount of iron exported to Germany last year within the next six months, and Germany will also increase the export of coking coal to France. The agreement also adjusts the timber trade between Germany and French colonies. In addition, France will return the Czech credit deposits, totaling 20 million francs.

<h3>Soviet Supreme Court Deprives Former Envoy to Bulgaria of Citizenship</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Supreme Court held a trial on the 17th regarding the case of Raskolnikov, the former Soviet envoy to Bulgaria, who deserted his post and fled. The outcome confirmed that the official had indeed deserted the Soviet Union and fled, joined the party of enemies of the people, and refused to return to the country for questioning. The court, in accordance with Articles 319 and 320 of the Russian Federation Code of Criminal Procedure, as well as the Soviet law promulgated on November 21, 1929, on punishing Soviet foreign officials who desert their posts and join the party of enemies of workers and peasants, sentenced Raskolnikov to deprivation of citizenship, making him a person without legal protection.

<p>Warsaw: According to information obtained by German sources here, the German government plans to dispatch several warships to the Free City of Danzig this month without notifying the Polish government in advance, intending to provoke Poland into taking action so that Germany can intervene under the pretext of self-defense. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Opposition Liberal Member of Parliament, Mander, asked Foreign Secretary Butler in the House of Commons today whether he thought it appropriate to send British and French troops to Danzig "to show our determination to take a firm stand." Butler replied "not appropriate." Mander further asked whether Germany was concentrating artillery in Danzig that could threaten Gdynia. Butler said that the information he had received did not confirm this claim. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>Danzig: A Polish customs officer was shot and killed this morning near Bostelau by a German Danzig customs officer. The incident is currently under investigation. According to the German customs officer, he opened fire in self-defense.

<p>Danzig: After investigation into the case of Polish customs officer Butsenwicz being shot and killed by a German Danzig customs officer this morning, it is reported that the Danzig Senate has expressed its condolences to the Polish Commissioner. Danzig newspapers claim that the incident occurred on Danzig territory, but Polish officials insist that Butsenwicz was shot nine yards inside the Polish border. According to unofficial Polish sources, Colonel Subokinski, the Polish Commissioner in Danzig, was arrested but then released. It is said that Subokinski was arrested on a military motorboat and released after the police who boarded the boat warned him that he had violated the regulations of the Free City regarding the passage of military vessels in the area. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Regarding the incident that recently occurred on the border between Poland and the Free City of Danzig, the official circumstances are now announced as follows: This morning at 10 o'clock, a Danzig customs officer and two members of the National Socialist Party entered Polish territory at the border checkpoint in Tlerzyński. A Polish border guard, Pułtycki, came out to stop them and was shot and killed. The perpetrators then fled back to the Free City. After the Polish authorities heard the news, they sent personnel to investigate. At 1 p.m., a representative of the Free City Senate expressed apologies to Trzciński, the Polish High Commissioner to the Free City. All afternoon newspapers in the Free City reported that a Polish official had been shot and wounded, but concealed his death in order to lessen the importance of the case. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Semi-official sources here recently received news from the Free City of Danzig, claiming that a customs officer of the city was ambushed and shot by a Polish civil servant in the town of Pissterau on the border. The customs officer, for self-defense, immediately returned fire and killed the person who shot him. The authorities of the Free City of Danzig immediately sent personnel to the scene to investigate. In addition, the semi-official German News Agency received a detailed report stating that a customs officer of the Free City of Danzig was patrolling the border area when suddenly a Polish civil servant opened fire on him from the Polish border for no reason. The customs officer immediately returned fire, wounding the civil servant. He intended to step forward to check on him and provide assistance, but two other Poles arrived, so he retreated back into the territory of the city to avoid causing other incidents, and immediately reported the information to his superiors.

<h3>Romanian Ports Willing to Be Used by Poland</h3>
<p>(London) It is rumored that if Germany and Poland go to war in the future, and the Polish port of Gdynia (on the Baltic Sea coast) is blockaded by Germany, Romania is willing to allow Poland to use its ports on the Black Sea coast. Diplomatic circles here are very interested in this statement, and it is said that Dutch experts studied the possibility of developing the Romanian port of Caratz (on the Danube River) and the port of Constanța (on the Black Sea coast) into free ports for use by all countries several years ago. Since Romania has a treaty of alliance with Poland, it is logical that it would allow Poland to use its ports on the Black Sea coast. However, under the current international situation, discussing this issue would make Hungary feel deeply uneasy, which would be inappropriate and not what Romania and Poland would want. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3>Germany Firmly Opposes Any Compromise Solution</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The government authorities are extremely indignant upon learning of rumors that Germany has a tendency to seek a compromise on the issue of the Free City of Danzig and have denied it. They stated that any compromise solution will be firmly opposed by Germany, and the purpose of all these rumors is simply to complicate the issue of the Free City of Danzig. The newspapers here today vehemently attacked Poland, and the general public widely spread rumors that the situation in the Free City of Danzig will become tense again in the coming weeks, and that all German cars and trucks will be requisitioned by the government on August 6. Foreign observers said that Berlin is scheduled to hold an air defense exercise at the end of this month, and high-angle guns will be installed on all major buildings at that time, and these rumors have probably arisen as a result.

Bai also solemnly declared the Germanic nature of East Prussia, in response to those who wish to seek to establish rights there, stating that soldiers are unwilling to reprimand such errors with words alone.

<h3>German Newspapers Comment on the Polish Territory Issue</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the statement made by Polish military inspector-general General Smigly to British and American reporters that "Poland is determined to defend Danzig by force, even without allies," the Berlin newspapers have written articles commenting on it, declaring that "if Europe wants to complete the work of appeasement, it must first avoid the threat of Polish belligerence." *Münsen City National Daily*, which has close ties with Göring, further attacked Poland's past territorial claims, stating, "The truly Polish territory within the Polish Republic is no more than one-third of the entire territory, and out of 33 million people, only 22 million are purely Polish. The other 11 million, or one-third of the total population, are recognized by the Poles themselves as other ethnic groups, including 4.5 million Ukrainians, 2.5 million Jews, 1.5 million Belarusians, and 1.5 million Germans. Since Poland has so many foreigners residing within its borders, like former Czechoslovakia, is it not difficult to expect them to live in peace and tranquility?" (Haitong dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Britain Provides Concrete Suggestions for the Tripartite Mutual Assistance Agreement; Explains the Meaning of Direct and Indirect Aggression; and the Military Constraints It Is Willing to Accept</h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the ongoing negotiations in Moscow, the right-wing newspaper *One Day News* recently reported that after exchanging views with the French government, the British government has decided to send new instructions to Sir Seeds, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, which will define direct and indirect aggression and determine the guarantees that should be given to each country's independence, which are related to the survival interests of the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. In addition, the military constraints that Britain is willing to accept in the mutual assistance agreement will also be explained. The moderate newspaper *Order* reported that it is not enough for peace-loving countries to simply unite, they must also contact the United States and the Soviet Union, on the one hand, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and France should establish a mutual assistance agreement, and on the other hand, the United States should supply the United Kingdom and France with military supplies. Fortunately, the United Kingdom and France are strong enough to control maritime traffic, so there is no need to worry about the interruption of supplies. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Reuters' diplomatic correspondent learned that the British government is currently considering the report received today from Sir Seeds, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, from Moscow regarding his talks with the Soviet Foreign Minister. However, it may not issue any response tonight or may need to consult with the French government on its observations before issuing it. This is expected to be delayed only briefly. (Reuters dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Observers here mostly believe that Europe will fall into crisis again after the German autumn harvest. On the other hand, the threat to British interests from the Japanese is also becoming increasingly serious, so political circles here mostly hope for the early conclusion of an alliance between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. At the same time, the British Foreign Office also hopes that the Anglo-Japanese conference in Tokyo will not break down, fearing that after the breakdown, the Japanese side will intensify its anti-British movement and cause Britain's prestige in the Far East to be completely swept away. As for the hope that the United States will abandon its isolationist policy and jointly sanction aggressors with Britain, this expectation has now been abandoned. The British government will submit new suggestions to the Soviet Union within a month to make it easier for the Soviet Union to accept. (Associated Press dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) When the House of Commons meets this month, several members will raise questions about the progress of the negotiations between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union. Prime Minister Chamberlain immediately replied, "The government has received a report after Sir Seeds, our country's ambassador to the Soviet Union, and the French ambassador to the Soviet Union continued talks with Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov on the 17th of this month, and has exchanged views with the French government." Labor Party Member of Parliament Dalton then asked, "After the British and French governments repeatedly sent instructions to their ambassadors to the Soviet Union, is there now more hope of an agreement being reached than there was a week ago?" The Prime Minister replied, "An agreement has not yet been reached." Labor Party Member of Parliament Ward King further asked, "Is it the Prime Minister's intention that the current negotiations can achieve success before Parliament adjourns for the recess, so that it can be announced to Parliament in a timely manner?" The Prime Minister replied, "I sincerely hope that it can be so." (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the conclusion of a mutual assistance agreement between the United Kingdom, France, and the Soviet Union, it has recently been reported by well-informed sources that the British government will give its ambassador to the Soviet Union, Sir Seeds, further instructions, but the content is currently uncertain. Since the Soviet Union raised the issue of the definition of "indirect aggression," the British and French governments have repeatedly exchanged views, believing that the arguments for replying to the Soviet Union should be carefully considered in terms of wording to avoid causing misunderstandings. French Ambassador to the United Kingdom Corbin spoke with Foreign Office officials twice today and had several long-distance telephone conversations with Paris. Diplomatic circles here still hope that the tripartite agreement can eventually succeed, but Conservative Party members believe that the current negotiations should not be allowed to drag on for so long, and there is similar sentiment in the opposition.

<h3>Polish Boycott of French Brandy Carries Political Meaning</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Polish tavern owners recently boycotted the famous French wine "Three-Star Brandy" for patriotic reasons. Since then, tavern customers will no longer have the pleasure of drinking brandy. The owner of the French Three-Star Brandy factory is also the publisher of the French left-wing newspaper *沃弗萊报* [*Voltaire*], which recently published an article by Congressman 蒂特 [Ti Te] on the Danzig issue, entitled "France Should Not Shed Blood for Danzig." The wording of the entire article strongly opposed France assisting Poland for the Danzig issue, and Poland therefore launched a movement to boycott French brandy. (Haitong dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>Obstacles Arise in British Financial Negotiations with Poland and Turkey; Difficulties in Fact Regarding the Purchase of Military Supplies</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the matter of the British government granting Turkey a credit loan of 30 million pounds, negotiations have recently been conducted between the two sides in the Turkish capital. It has recently been learned that difficulties have arisen, and the situation is the same as the negotiations being conducted between the United Kingdom and Poland. Therefore, if the negotiations between the United Kingdom and Poland can achieve satisfactory results, the negotiations between the United Kingdom and Turkey can also be resolved accordingly. According to the original agreement, Turkey should use the funds loaned by the United Kingdom to purchase military supplies from the United Kingdom or France, but because the United Kingdom and France are unable to fully supply Turkey's needs for the time being, the country wants to quickly purchase military supplies, so it plans to use part of the funds to order ordnance from the United States and other neutral countries, which is the source of the current negotiation difficulties. (Havas dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The Polish financial delegation originally reached an agreement with the British government on a loan and was scheduled to sign an agreement on the 14th of this month. However, because Poland wanted to use a portion of the funds to purchase ordnance from the United States to meet urgent needs, while the United Kingdom insisted that all the funds be used in the United Kingdom, the opinions could not be reconciled. Until noon today, Colonel Kok, the chief representative of Poland, received instructions from his government to return to his country immediately, so he took a route through Paris and returned to Warsaw. Polish sources here recently explained that as long as the British attitude does not change, the financial negotiations between the United Kingdom and Poland will not be able to continue. This can be seen from Colonel Kok's order to return to his country. Regarding this matter, French representatives have been working hard to mediate between the United Kingdom and Poland in order to find a compromise. Although Colonel Kok has left the United Kingdom, it is not certain that the current negotiations will come to a standstill. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Naval Minister Lord Stanhope recently announced in the House of Lords that the House will adjourn on August 4, but there are still many issues on the agenda, and adjournment can only be implemented after several bills proposed by the government are passed. If a financial agreement between Britain and Poland can be concluded in a timely manner, it should also be submitted for a vote. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(London) Colonel Kok, the chief representative of the Polish financial delegation, who had originally been ordered to return to his country, received instructions on the verge of departure to postpone his departure. The British and Polish sides then reopened negotiations. Colonel Kok has held talks with William, a representative of the British Treasury, and will meet with Sir Lees-Rose, the British government's economic advisor, tomorrow. It is reported that General Ironside, the inspector-general of the British overseas garrison, has submitted a report after holding talks with Polish military authorities, praising Poland's strong military strength and solid defenses, but noting that its financial strength is very weak and needs to be remedied. The British government authorities may therefore change their attitude, leading to the hope that the British and Polish sides will be closer. (Havas dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>British and Polish Staff Talks; Plans to Formulate Action Plan; Poland Hopes Britain Will Supply Military Supplies</h3>
<p>(London) According to the *Daily Telegraph*, as a result of the staff talks conducted by Ironside, the British Inspector General of Overseas Colonial Forces, in Poland, a concrete plan of action has been formulated, but its content is still unknown. *Daily Mail* reported that the Polish authorities explained to Ironside Poland's need for military supplies, including heavy artillery, anti-aircraft guns, small cannons, and machine guns, all of which it hopes the United Kingdom will transport in large quantities. (Haitong News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: General Ironside, the British Inspector General of Overseas Military Forces, continued talks with the Polish General Staff yesterday. At noon, he visited Polish President Mościcki, who then hosted a banquet, and those invited to accompany him included Polish military inspector-general General Smigly, Foreign Minister Burke, and other senior military officers.

<h3>Germanic Group in Hungary Demands Increased Representation in Parliament</h3>
<p>Budapest – The German minority within Hungary today issued a thirteen-point demand, one point of which requires that there be at least fifteen German members in the Hungarian parliament.

<h3>Japanese Provocation of "Anti-British" Sentiment in North China; Church Properties Attacked; Most Chinese Unwilling to Participate in this Movement</h3>
<p>The Tianjin correspondent of the Continental Daily reports on July 10: According to investigations disclosed here, although the Japanese have consistently strived to stir up "anti-British" sentiment in the occupied areas from the Shandong and Hebei coasts to the mountainous regions of Shanxi, the Chinese people not only remain indifferent to this movement but also harbor animosity towards it. Due to their specific circumstances, although their antipathy is deeply rooted, they are bound to</p>
<p>express it passively. They do their best not to actively participate in this movement, but they are often unable to avoid it, particularly in more important cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Taiyuan, and Qingdao. In these cities, the Japanese and their agents are conducting extensive inspection campaigns, compelling residents to participate in anti-British demonstrations and parades. As far as the Chinese are concerned, there are many reasons why they are hostile to this movement. Regardless of past Sino-British relations, the Chinese have recognized in recent years, especially since the Chinese currency reform of 1935, that Britain has been one of China's</p>
<p>greatest friends. Britain was the first to assist in maintaining the stability of China's new currency. However, according to those returning from traveling in the west and south, the Japanese are not discouraged by the Chinese people's hostile attitude towards the movement they have launched. The Japanese are redoubling their efforts everywhere to "eliminate all British interests in China." They are clearly determined to make the Chinese resent the British people. In pursuing this goal, they fabricate lies and rumors, aiming to "poison" the hearts of the people. According to</p>
<p>foreign travelers in Beijing, Chinese-language newspapers in Beijing (all controlled by the Japanese) and Japanese-owned Western newspapers are prominently publishing anti-British propaganda, detailing all anti-British demonstrations and parades, as well as speeches by participating Japanese and Chinese puppets. Several days ago, the Japanese made a surprising accusation against certain British expatriates in Tianjin, claiming that they were "engaged in espionage activities, supplying bandits with weapons and equipment." Although there is no evidence at all, newspapers controlled by the Japanese have directly published this news. Furthermore, someone associated with the Shanxi Church has arrived here, forcefully claiming that the Japanese in that mountainous province have just begun a thorough campaign to "eradicate all church influence in the province." In the few towns truly under Japanese control,</p>
<p>church properties are often attacked, and almost all Christian institutions in the province are plastered with paper and cloth banners inscribed with anti-British slogans. One of the banners hanging on the wall of a church in Taiyuan urged the public to reenact the Boxer Rebellion. A foreigner arriving from Qingdao also claimed that there is also a fierce anti-British movement there, launched by high-ranking Japanese civilian and military officials, aiming to destroy British interests in the city.</p>
<p>Tombstone of Han Shizhong Destroyed by Hurricane</p>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: The tombstone of Han Shizhong of the Song Dynasty is located in the Xili area of Lingyan Mountain in Mudu Town, Suzhou Prefecture. It has a history of over 700 years. The stele is 22.5 feet high, with the inscription "Tablet of the Founding Merit of Zhongxing Zuoming Dingguo Yuanxun" bestowed by Emperor Xiaozong, with characters 1.2 feet in diameter. The stele surface contains three thousand nine hundred small characters, arranged in eighty-eight lines, each line with one hundred and fifty characters, written by Zhou Bi of the Song Dynasty. The text was drafted by Hu Xiong by imperial order. The height of the stele forehead and the number of characters are the first monument to record deeds. This time, it was suddenly blown down by a hurricane, and the ancient stele was cut into four sections, including one section of the stele top and three sections of the stele body. The giant tortoise under the stele was also broken due to the collapse of the stele. The destruction of ancient monuments that are nearly a thousand years old by wind is indeed a loss to our country's culture.</p>
<h3>Violent Wind and Rain Turn Chongming into a Waterlogged Land; Japanese Troops Board Ships and Leave Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chongming Correspondence: Chongming is isolated in the sea and is often hit by hurricanes. Fortunately, the disasters are minor. On the 12th, a violent wind suddenly rose, accompanied by torrential rain that did not stop for one day and three nights. The sea embankment outside Nanmen was in disrepair due to war and was badly damaged. Unexpectedly, this time, the violent wind and rain caused it to collapse completely, and the sea water rushed straight to the county seat. The suburbs have become a vast ocean, and most of the houses in the city have collapsed. The number of dead and injured is impossible to count. The northeast is a coastal area with a lower terrain, so the disaster is particularly severe. In low-lying areas, only the rooftops can be seen. Many ships in the sea were overturned by the wind. Not only is the entire county's agricultural production completely hopeless, but also the lives and properties of the people have suffered immeasurable losses. The Japanese garrison force and pacification team stationed in Chongming City, Toda Division, also boarded ships, left the city, and went to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Chongqing Evacuates Population, Builds Suburban Urban Areas; Measures to Control Food Supply Being Drafted</h3>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: In order to thoroughly evacuate the people from the urban area of Chongqing, the highest authorities ordered the four banks, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Communications Bank, and the Agricultural Bank, to lend ten million yuan for the construction of suburban urban areas. Currently, twelve construction sites have been selected, and it has been decided to complete three districts in the first phase. The construction funds, amounting to three million yuan, have been disbursed as loans by the four banks, and the engineering work is currently underway. In addition, in order to ensure that the supply and demand of daily necessities such as grain and flour are balanced, the municipal authorities here have decided to implement control over the grain supply in the urban area. Detailed measures are currently being drafted and will be implemented in the shortest possible time.

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>Having read the news column of the tenth day of this month in your esteemed newspaper, which described the desolation of Dinghai after its fall, stating that the Japanese army's invasion of Dinghai and its subsequent loss within a few hours was truly beyond general expectations, and that according to relevant sources, one of those who guided the Japanese army in attacking the city was the son of a Mr. Lu, the owner of the Xinyi Zhai pharmacy in Nancheng, I was greatly astonished. I have been in Shanghai since last winter, and this spring I took up the position of accounting at the Huaxing Chang Copper and Iron Machinery Foundry, without ever stepping out of Shanghai. The section reported is clearly untrue. Moreover, although Xinyi Zhai was opened by me, my surname is Fang, but it was falsely stated as Lu. This matter concerns my reputation, so I am writing to inform you and request that your newspaper make a correction. Respectfully, Fang Rongfu, July 19th.</p>
<p>Educational News</p>
<h3>The Evolution and Opinions on the Compilation of Curriculum in Chinese Universities (Part 1): The Curriculum of Universities in the Late Qing Dynasty Was Without System; The National Government Began to Organize After Its Establishment</h3>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Chongqing) The Ministry of Education issued an article on "The Evolution and Opinions on the Compilation of Curriculum," which is excerpted below:</p>
<p>The curriculum of schools above the Chinese specialized level was not so chaotic from the beginning. The economics, politics, literature, natural sciences, agriculture, industry, commerce, medicine, and eight disciplines of universities and higher agricultural, industrial, and commercial schools, and the curriculum of advanced normal schools in the late Qing Dynasty, were all detailed in the officially approved school regulations. After the revolution, the regulations for specialized schools promulgated in the first year of the Republic of China and the regulations for universities promulgated in the second year of the Republic of China also had special articles stipulating the subjects of each type of school. What was stipulated may not have been entirely appropriate, and no dates for modification or revision were set, which was somewhat rigid and could not be improved with the evolution of the times. However, the establishment of courses in each school was followed, so that no names were cleverly established and there was no system. Examination was easy and the level was relatively uniform. To seek improvement, there was also a basis. This unified curriculum system has been implemented for twenty years since the establishment of universities in our country.</p>
<p>In November of the eleventh year of the Republic of China, the reform plan of the school system was promulgated, the spirit of which was to promote the spirit of civilian education, adapt to the needs of social evolution, seek the development of individuality, and leave more room for local flexibility. Therefore, it advocated the "elective system for universities." As a result, the unified curriculum system of schools above the specialized level was fundamentally shaken. In February of the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Education, based on the principles of the new school system, formulated and promulgated the regulations for national universities. Article 6 stated that "the duration of study in national universities shall be four to six years, and the curriculum may use an elective system." Regarding the power to formulate curriculum, Article 7 of the regulations stated: "Each department and each department and graduate school of a national university shall establish a professors' meeting to plan the curriculum and its implementation. Each shall be organized by the full professors of the department and graduate school." The same article also stated: "When each department plans the curriculum, lecturers shall also be present." Since the curriculum of each department was formulated by each school itself, it was difficult to avoid each school setting up courses based on personnel, cleverly establishing various names. Due to the different concepts of the principals, the objectives of setting up courses were different. The worst result was that there was no main test, copied from the east, patched from the west, and arranged in a scattered manner. The curriculum of each school evolved into the phenomenon of division and complexity described in the previous section. Moreover, due to the impermanence of personnel changes, the opening of courses was often in a state of change and uncertainty, which became more fragmented.</p>
<p>The spirit of the new school system was originally to promote the spirit of democracy and give excellent people the opportunity to develop freely. However, as a result, universities with insufficient talent were prone to simple curriculum facilities that could not meet social expectations and the level of great efforts. Universities with abundant talent had the disadvantage of tending towards specialization and difficulty in curriculum development. Therefore, in the thirteenth and fourteenth years of the Republic of China, the most developed universities in China were also the most criticized. In May of the seventeenth year, the first National Education Conference declared: "University education should determine standards and improve the level. We resolve to ask the University Council to promulgate the university graduation examination and degree awarding regulations. After that, when each university handles graduation, it should hold a comprehensive examination of the students' past courses. Those who pass will be given certificates and will not be awarded degrees. All bachelor's and master's degrees must be awarded by the University Council after passing the examination or review by the University Council." The declaration also said, "We stipulate the standards for the curriculum, teachers, and equipment of private schools, and engage in active guidance, rewards, or prohibitions." It expressed dissatisfaction with the level of universities and wanted to make partial regulations on university curriculum.</p>
<p>In August of the eighteenth year, the Ministry of Education promulgated university regulations, and then stipulated the basic subjects that should be set up in the first grade. Article 8 of the regulations also stated: "The curriculum distribution and curriculum standards of each college or department shall be determined separately."</p>
<p>In July of the nineteenth year, the regulations for the drafting committee of university curriculum and equipment standards were promulgated. From that time on, the Ministry of Education has been hiring experts to start sorting out the university curriculum. During the era of former Minister Zhu Jia-hua, great efforts were made. In August of the twentieth year, former Minister Zhu reported in the memorial weekly report of the Central Party Headquarters, criticizing the phenomenon of university curriculum focusing on advanced courses and neglecting basic courses, saying, "In the Department of Economics, the Outline of Economics may not be available, but Marx's Capital must be available. In the field of literature, courses such as the History of Literature are not important, and the works of various famous writers must be set up as special courses. In the Department of Geology, there must be a special professorship in paleontology, as for ordinary geology, it does not matter if someone who studies prospecting or civil engineering is called to teach it. In physics, ordinary physics can be ignored, and Einstein's theory of relativity must be available, no matter how the teachers and scholars are. Even the calculus of mathematics can be handled casually by finding someone to take on the task." At the same time, former Minister Zhu pointed out the phenomenon of repetition in the university curriculum, saying, "For example, in the Faculty of Law, if there is already a Chinese Diplomatic History and Unequal Treaties, there is no need to set up another course, because what is there to talk about in Chinese Diplomatic History after the Unequal Treaties are removed? Isn't this redundant to set up such separate courses?" There are also some courses that are not necessary for this department, such as the Geology Department setting up many mining and metallurgy courses, and the Chemistry Department setting up many chemical industry courses. If we take a closer look at the curriculum of domestic universities, we can point out a lot of courses that do not need to be opened separately."</p>
<h3>Unified Enrollment for National Colleges; Principles for Distributing New Students</h3>
<p>Electricity Celebration Communication: The Ministry of Education held a unified enrollment for national colleges and universities in the 28th year. On the 8th, the Unified Enrollment Committee registered in the local United Daily to announce the key points of the enrollment brochure in advance. Regarding the principles for distributing the admitted students, the committee has also formulated preliminary distribution methods, so that candidates can refer to them when filling in the desired schools and departments when registering. The distribution principles are recorded as follows: (1) Admitted students will be distributed according to their first choice, regardless of the examination area, in accordance with their grades, and in the order of tons. (2) When the first choice school of the admitted students is full, they will be assigned to the colleges and universities in the examination area and nearby areas according to their second and third choice departments, still in the order of grades. (3) When the first, second, and third choice colleges of the admitted students are full and cannot be assigned, the Ministry will refer to their examination results, examination area, and desired department, and assign them to corresponding colleges. (4) If the desired department is full in all colleges and universities, the characteristics of the examination area and results of the students may be taken into consideration, and other departments with the same nature may be assigned.</p>
<h3>Private Schools in the French Concession Apply to Authorities for Recordation; Request Exemption from Suppression</h3>
<p>Since the August 13th Incident in the French Concession, it has been heard that a small number of residents have set up private schools on their own to maintain their livelihoods and enroll students, and there are now no fewer than thirty or forty of them. Recently, because the patrol room has occasionally taken measures to suppress them, it is known that the teachers of each private school have jointly applied to the French Public Works Bureau for recordation and requested that the patrol room personnel be notified to exempt them from suppression, so as to maintain their livelihoods.</p>

The school has spacious grounds and complete facilities, and it is said that it is very practical for surveying practice and physical and chemical experiments.</p>
<p>Zheguang Middle School Rewards Students</p>
<p>Since Principal Wang Zhe'an and Vice Principal Lv Tongwen took over Zheguang Middle School, they have tried to promote school affairs and facilities, which have been praised by people in the community. The new students admitted to the junior and senior levels of this session all meet the standards. Most of the applicants are from Zhejiang, because the school is organized by the old teachers of the former Zhejiang Provincial Jiazhong and Zhejiang Provincial Hangzhou High School and has a considerable reputation. Currently, there are still vacancies in each grade, and a continuation recruitment will be held on August 8th. In addition, the old students of Jiazhong in the 26th year who received public funding included Lu Jiaju, Zhu Wenkui, Xu Fulin, Shen Yunfen, Lin Baoying, Fan Qingfen, Zhu Wenhan, Ying Qingcheng, Meng Ru'ao, Shen Ruzong, Zhu Hui, Zhong Yafen, Jin Shouhua, Chen Lvqing, etc., a total of fourteen people.

<h3>Silver Coin Cup Table Tennis Tournament</h3>
<p>Yesterday's results:</p>
<p>China wins Golden City 13 to 7 China Agriculture wins China Enterprise 13 to 4 Dingkang wins China Exchange A 13 to 4 To Whom It May Concern: Our team is a team organized by the school. We registered for this year's China Youth-sponsored Invitational Volleyball Tournament under the names of Xuanlu, Bluestar, and Minfeng, in order to seek progress in technology. However, the grouping regulations and methods recently announced by the China Youth authorities suddenly divide the ordinary and school groups, and set up two championships, which is obviously different from the competition regulations announced by the association when our team registered. After the announcement of this method, it had a great impact on our team, and we immediately raised questions to the association orally in order to seek a fair solution, but unexpectedly, we have never been understood by the association. Under these circumstances, our team has no choice but to withdraw from the league. Xuanlu, Bluestar, and Minlu Women's Volleyball Team Sincerely.</p>

<h3>1939-40 Men's Basketball Rule Changes</h3>
<p>— (Translated by Qu Honglu)</p>
<p>Important basketball rule changes for this season, reviewed and approved by the American National Board Rule Committee, are listed below. Although not yet officially announced, they have generally been passed. Translated excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The distance from the backboard to the baseline (end line) is changed to four feet (translator's note: the old rule was two feet or four feet). The maximum and optimal court length should be ninety-four feet, and the distance between backboards is eighty-six feet. (All American schools unanimously approved the change of the distance from the backboard to the end line to four feet, so the Rule Committee has passed this rule.)</p>
<p>(2) After a technical foul free throw, regardless of whether the shot is made or not, the penalized team throws the ball into play at the center line (division line). If it is a personal foul, the penalized team captain has the right to waive the free throw and choose to have their team member throw the ball into play at the center line. If the free throw does not decide the outcome, this rule applies to the last free throw. Double fouls are not included in this example. (The American National Association of Basketball Coaches, in view of the fact that in extremely tense games, the team trailing in the last moment often intentionally fouls, hoping to gain possession of the ball after the free throw. This behavior is detrimental to the true meaning of sports, hence this change.)</p>
<p>(3) If a player shooting the ball is fouled or obstructed from behind by an opposing player, regardless of whether the ball goes in the basket, two free throws should be awarded. (This rule is intended to avoid all kinds of unsportsmanlike and morally crude behaviors.)</p>
<p>(4) Any player on a team can call a "timeout." In other words, calling a "timeout" is limited to the captain alone.</p>
<p>(5) Each team gets one additional "timeout" in each "overtime period."</p>
<p>(The rules committee believes that the "overtime period" is not part of the game time, so in addition to the five "timeouts," one more "timeout" should be added for each "overtime period.")</p>
<p>(6) The words "or backboard" (Dr. Backbord) in Rule 14, Article 9 are deleted.</p>
<p>(Translator's note) In addition to the above six important changes, there are many wording changes, which cannot all be detailed one by one. The rules adopted by the China National Amateur Athletic Federation are those approved by the World Games, and their effective period is from 1936 to 1940.

<h3>Stabilizing Foreign Exchange is the Priority</h3>
<p>— Hou Ji</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign exchange black market once sharply contracted on the 18th of this month, but unexpectedly tightened severely in less than three days. Speculators initially targeted futures, considering the limited supply of spot goods as a backup. The futures market, threatened by seven or eight contracts, fluctuated even more sharply, with increasingly disparate bid-ask spreads. Drastic fluctuations in futures affected the stability of spot prices, and in turn, instability in spot prices exacerbated the tightening of futures. These formed a cause-and-effect cycle, repeatedly exacerbating each other, resulting in another surge in commodity prices as expected, which will likely cause even greater difficulties for the people's livelihood. I believe that the current issue should no longer aim for high exchange rates but seek ways to stabilize exchange rates. This is similar to the silver price problem in the past: the concern is not high prices but instability. The level of the exchange rate is merely a reflection of the purchasing power of the legal tender (fapi). Although it is related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, it is not the root cause of the current public anxiety. We appreciate the past achievements of the national government in maintaining foreign exchange, and we also consider stabilizing exchange rates as an urgent priority. Stabilizing exchange rates even one day earlier can curb the outflow of capital and eliminate the panic in the financial market. The facts of the past two years are clear, and there is no need for further elaboration. Some commentators attribute the instability of the foreign exchange black market to the manipulation of speculators, but they do not realize that without resolving the issues of "North Banknotes" and "futures exchange," there can be no stability, even without speculation.</p>
<p>"North Banknotes" refers to banknotes issued in North China. At the beginning of this week, the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank in Shanghai refused to accept these banknotes. However, small amounts are still allowed to be exchanged for Shanghai banknotes to avoid greater losses for merchants and ordinary people. Based on the information we have received from Tianjin, stopping the use of these banknotes is unlikely to be effective. Although the Tianjin branch of the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank have gradually reduced the acceptance of Shanghai remittances, limiting the daily total amount to 5,000 to 10,000, the fees are still extremely low, charging only one yuan per thousand as a handling fee, equivalent to the official exchange rate. The low fees are enticing, and the Tianjin banks are willing to do whatever it takes to get a slice of the pie. The amount of funds remitted to Shanghai accumulates to a considerable sum throughout the year, mostly used to purchase foreign exchange for arbitrage. Given these facts, the effect of Shanghai stopping the use of "North Banknotes" is limited. If Tianjin can restrict the remittance of "North Banknotes" to Shanghai, or outright refuse to accept Tianjin remittances, then the "North Banknote" problem in Shanghai can be easily resolved, and the foreign exchange market in Tianjin can also change its old ways. The constraints on the Shanghai foreign exchange black market can also be somewhat adjusted. This is one point.</p>
<p>The so-called "futures exchange" refers to the futures market in the foreign exchange black market. The origin of forward exchange rates is attributed to the theory of interest rate parity and the theory of purchasing power parity. Although these can have a regulatory effect on the market in normal times, they have become tools to damage finance today. In recent years, changes in exchange rates have been more sensitive in forward exchange rates, and spot rates are affected by this with every step. The importance of futures exchange is evident. Last winter, speculators heavily arbitraged between the spot and three-month forward markets in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong government ordered the suspension of forward Shanghai remittances, and the exchange market stabilized. Then, why can't Shanghai follow the example of Hong Kong and quickly suspend the futures market in foreign exchange on the black market, reduce the activity of speculators, and alleviate the threat to spot foreign exchange? This is the second point.</p>
<p>In summary, although these may not be profound theories, addressing the issues of "North Banknotes" and "futures exchange" is a practical approach. These two issues are the main problems in the financial market today. Without resolving these issues, the foreign exchange market will be unstable, the panic in the market cannot be eliminated, and future disasters will continue to escalate.</p>
<h3>Finance: The Exchange Market is Unstable and Tense, the Trend of Contraction is Increasing, Japanese Merchants are Engaging in Fierce Grabbing Again, the Closing Price of British Gold is Four Shillings and a Half, the US Exchange Rate is 8.625 Yuan, the Tightening Continues After Market Close</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market situation yesterday: The initial announcement of HSBC's listed prices at 9:30 AM showed no changes. It was not until the second announcement at 9:50 AM that the British exchange rate was reduced by 25, the US exchange rate was listed at 9.4375, and other currencies also dropped uniformly. However, at 2:30 PM, the listed prices were removed. Due to the Japanese banks (reportedly settling military expenses) again engaging in grabbing in the informal market for British and US exchange rates, various import firms in Shanghai became alarmed and rushed to buy. Chinese merchants and speculators also secretly engaged in activities to grab the exchange rates, causing the tightening trend to erupt again, presenting a state of "having prices but no market." The situation was extremely chaotic, and everyone in the market was shocked and stunned. Initially, the opening price for British gold was 5 shillings and 0.03125, and the US exchange rate was 9.8125. HSBC was willing to supply slightly lower prices, and therefore foreign firms made some settlements. However, at 9:50 AM, HSBC's listed prices suddenly dropped sharply, with British gold at 4 shillings and 75, and the US exchange rate at 9.25. At these prices, HSBC was quite willing to discuss transactions. Additionally, Hong Kong sent a cable offering to sell, and the market stabilized immediately, fluctuating until noon, with the British exchange rate loosening to 4 shillings and 8.4375, and the US exchange rate also at 9.4375. In the afternoon, because HSBC had no intention of supplying, and under the unfavorable atmosphere, the grabbing trend rose again. HSBC removed the listed prices, only quoting the alarming and expensive prices of 4 shillings and a half for British gold and 8.75 yuan for US dollars (compared to the previous day, British gold tightened by half a shilling, and the US rate contracted by 9.375), making it extremely difficult to find sellers. As a result, the closing price for British gold reached 4 shillings and a half and the US exchange rate was 8.625 yuan. After the market closed, the trend continued to tighten, shrinking to an unprecedented record of 4 shillings and 25 for British gold and 8.25 yuan for US dollars. Futures were not considered at all due to the spot market conditions, and the tightening trend was similar. The transaction volume was very sparse, and the swap market disappeared invisibly. The transaction volume for spot goods was also very low throughout the day. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, there was no market to speak of, and banks did not open, and the state of unease can be imagined.</p>
<p>HSBC's Listed Prices Show Another Contraction</p>
<p>The morning opening showed that the large and small London strips remained flat, the New York silver price was stable, London raw gold rebounded by half a shilling, the exchange rate for British against the US dropped by 1.5 cents, against Shanghai dropped by 3.75, against France remained unchanged. The US against British contracted by 0.0625, against Shanghai dropped by 0.26, and against France dropped by 1.25. The central bank's listed prices for each exchange rate remained the same. Banks' spot selling prices in the morning were 5 shillings and 0.03125 for British gold, and 9.8125 yuan for the US exchange rate, the same as the previous afternoon's closing prices. After opening, there were many foreign firms settling payments, but HSBC was only willing to maintain the listed price, and other foreign banks had no intention of selling, causing the market to tighten slightly. Foreign firms absorbed HSBC spot British gold at 5 shillings, and spot US dollars at 9.6875. When HSBC's listed prices were announced, there were no changes, and the silver balance tax was still waived. After this, the grabbing intention of foreign firms became more intense, and Japanese banks also began to follow suit and grab fiercely. Additionally, Sassoon, a Western merchant, also aggressively absorbed from the futures market. However, HSBC, seeing this situation, stopped supplying at the listed price, making the market even tighter. At 9:50 AM, HSBC's second announcement of listed prices reduced British gold by 25 to 4 shillings and 75, and the US exchange rate was reduced by 4.375 to 9.25, and all other currencies were also uniformly contracted, creating a new unprecedented record. At this time, HSBC was still willing to maintain its second revised listed price, selling spot British gold at 4 shillings and 75, and spot US dollars at 9.25 to foreign firms and Japanese banks. Later, a sudden Hong Kong cable offered to sell, and other foreign banks also slightly sold, so the situation stabilized. Hong Kong Electric, East Asia and Macquarie Banks successively sold spot British gold at 4 shillings and 8.125 and 8.4375 and spot US dollars at 9.375 and 9.4375 to foreign firms and some banks. It was already noon, and it was difficult to get Hong Kong exchange rate quoted and had to be delayed to the noon closing. Banks' spot selling prices were 4 shillings and 8.43275 for British gold and 9.4375 yuan for US dollars, compared to the morning opening, British rate tightened by 1.875, the US softened by 3.75.</p>
<p>In the Afternoon, it has Become a "Having Prices, No Market" Situation</p>
<p>In the afternoon, because there was no intention to supply after the market opened, and with the Hong Kong telegram stopping sales, and with various unfavorable atmospheres, Chinese silk and cotton merchants and foreign firms began to scramble, and the tightening wind became fierce again. It was also heard that HSBC had removed the listed price and did not see a subsequent listing, only quoting British gold at 4 shillings and a half, and the US rate at 8.75 yuan, but the position was very small, so the black market presented a situation of "having prices but no market" due to the disappearance of sellers. Until the late closing at 3 PM, banks' spot selling prices were 4 shillings and a half for British gold and 8.625 yuan for US dollars. As a result, compared to the afternoon closing of the previous day, British rate tightened further by 5.3125, and the US softened further by 1.1875 yuan. (It was heard that the dark market after the closing of the British market weakened to 4 shillings and 25, and the US continued to tighten to 8.25 yuan.) Finally, there was a slight recovery to 4 shillings and 375 for the British and 8.5 yuan for the US.</p>
<p>Hong Kong Shanghai Rate is 330 Yuan</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 20th Dispatch: The exchange market opened today with volatility. Spot and futures prices for the US dollar are unchanged. Spot prices for the British pound contract by 0.0335, forward prices tighten by 0.0625. Spot Shanghai rates rise slightly by one yuan. Spot Japanese rates tighten by 25. At 10:30 AM, the market atmosphere softened. Spot British rates continued to tighten by 0.03115, to 1 shilling 2 pence 65625. The US rate also shrank by 0.0625, to 28.625 yuan. Forward prices have no market. Shanghai rates continue to rise by nine yuan, to 295 yuan. Japanese rates tighten by another 25, to 104.5 yuan. At 11:05 AM, the US dollar spot rate tightened again by 0.0625, to 28.5625 yuan. There is no forward market. Shanghai rates rise by another five yuan, to 300 yuan. The afternoon closing Hong Kong exchange rate spot price returned to loosen by 0.0625, to 28.625 yuan. Forward rates opened at 28.5 yuan, tightening by 125 compared to the morning opening. Shanghai rates dropped by three yuan, to 297 yuan. The market is stable. The afternoon opening was calm. There were no forward markets for British and US pounds. The later closing turned unstable again. Shanghai rates rose again by 33 yuan, for a total increase of 45 yuan for the day.</p>
<p>Tianjin British Exchange Rate Advances to Four Shillings</p>
<p>Tianjin, 20th Dispatch: The exchange market opened weakly today, tightening another 25 for British exchange rate, to 2 shillings 75 (according to yesterday, the lowest trading price for Tianjin British exchange rate had shrunk to 3 pence 8125), and contracted by 0.4375 for the US rate, to 7.3125 yuan. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by five yuan, to 135 yuan. "Joint banknotes" on the dark market are more expensive by one yuan.</p>
<h3>Banknote Exchange – Overcrowded Beyond Belief</h3>
<p>Since the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank started exchanging banknotes issued in North China, only ten yuan were allowed, one bill per person. If someone was discovered to be trying to exchange a second bill, they were turned away immediately. The exchangers were unusually crowded, and detectives were stationed to maintain order, queuing up in single file. According to one gentleman who went to the Bank of Communications on Avenue Joffre yesterday, from the time he joined the queue to the time he exchanged ten one-yuan bills, it took twenty-five minutes, which was considered relatively quick. Another gentleman went to the Bank of Communications at the intersection of Route Haug and attempted to exchange ten yuan. The crowd was so dense that it stretched from the bank entrance through Jing'an Temple Road, Yu Yuan Road, and Jiaozhou Road, end to end. After standing in line for two hours without being able to exchange, he returned dejectedly. It is now unimaginable that in this era of prevalent paper money, we are seeing a resurgence of the crowding and rushing to exchange banknotes (for silver dollars) of yesteryear.</p>
<h3>Eliminating Discounting of Drafts</h3>
<p>— Yu Zhen</p>
<p>Remittance drafts were originally cashed the next day, with value equal to cash. After the Shanghai Incident of 1937 (year 26 of the Republic), following the Ministry of Finance's announcement of measures to stabilize finance, silver firms, in order to facilitate the capital activities of industry and commerce and increase their funds, requested and received approval from the Ministry of Finance to supplement the measures. This stipulated that remittance drafts should only be remitted to other firms and should not be used for cash payment or purchasing foreign exchange. Therefore, remittance drafts after August 13th (8/13 Incident) were actually legal tender (fapi) deposits. Over time, due to the widespread use of legal tender and restrictions imposed by the financial stability measures, it was not easy for general depositors to obtain cash, so they began to pay a discount fee to convert the remittance drafts into legal tender. In 1938, the highest discount rate reached 79 yuan. The Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank then intervened through the Bankers' Association to stabilize the price at around 50 yuan by adjusting funds between firms. After the Ministry of Finance announced new restrictions on withdrawals in Shanghai on June 23rd this year, the discount suddenly rose sharply, reaching a reported but untraded price of 200 yuan. Formal transactions began on the 23rd, with prices between 120 and 130 yuan. Because of rumors that new remittance draft rules would be implemented starting July 4th, the closing price on June 30th dropped to 72.5 yuan. When silver firms opened for business on July 4th and the new remittance draft rules were implemented, it only affected the internal operations of silver firms. Foreign banks still did not accept them, so the discount actually increased by 20 yuan, with prices in the 90s of yuan. As of the 14th, it stayed between 95 and 100 yuan. On the 15th, due to strong demand, the price reached 106 yuan. On the 17th, it rose to 109 yuan. On the 18th, because Hong Kong no longer supplied foreign exchange at 6 shillings and 5625, the foreign exchange market and gold were rising, and the demand for banknotes increased, so the discount rose to 137.5 yuan. On the 19th, the price reached as high as 165 yuan. On the 20th (yesterday), because cash skyrocketed and foreign exchange contracted again, the demand for banknotes was even greater, and the discount had risen to 200 yuan. One yuan of remittance draft was only worth 83 cents of legal tender. There has been no news of the three banks intervening to maintain the price. Currently, remittance drafts require collateral to be obtained from the bank's reserve. If the price continues to fall, it may harm the entire Shanghai financial system. In my humble opinion, remittance drafts should not be allowed to be discounted, and legal tender should be supplied to meet the legitimate needs of industry and commerce. The exchange should strictly limit the amount of remittance drafts that firms can obtain later, and implement tightening measures. Silver firms should also refuse requests from general depositors without legitimate purposes to pay out the remittance drafts in one go. In this way, the illegitimate transactions of discounting may gradually be eliminated.</p>
<p>The Frenzied Purchase Reaches Boiling Point</p>
<p>Since this morning, initially securities brokers and money changers had strong buying intentions for gold bars (ten taels per bar), bidding as high as 3,220-3,230 yuan. However, sellers remained passive. Suddenly, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate had softened, and the buying increased, with everyone rushing to bid, raising the price significantly and it opened at 3,300 yuan. A securities broker absorbed 50 taels from a certain silver firm. Then, the silver firm continued to dump, coupled with a certain gold shop competing to release its stock on behalf of speculators, causing the price to drop by 60 yuan. A money changer sold 20 taels to a cash firm, with the price of 240 yuan being the lowest for the day. A certain money changer then began to aggressively buy, and the supply from sellers decreased, immediately pushing the price back up, and breaking through the 3,300 yuan mark. A certain money changer bought 50 taels from a fellow firm, with the price being 320 yuan. Suddenly, it was heard that HSBC's second listed prices were announced, uniformly contracting, which strengthened people's conviction, and sellers became more reluctant to part with their gold, expanding the rising trend. A certain money changer continued to aggressively purchase more than 300 taels, and another money changer also aggressively bought over 100 taels. The price was pushed up by 110 yuan, breaking through the 3,400 yuan mark. A certain money changer bought 50 taels from a securities broker, with the price being 430 yuan. Most of the gold was supplied by a certain gold shop (on behalf of speculators) and jewelry shops. There were many limited price sales, so retail investors and jewelry shops rushed to sell, immediately dropping the price by 35 yuan. A cash firm sold 50 taels to a certain jewelry shop, with the price being 395 yuan. Later, a foreign bank entrusted a certain silver firm to absorb over 200 taels, and a certain gold shop on behalf of speculators also bought more than it sold, restarting the rising trend, leaping another 85 yuan. A certain gold shop (on behalf of speculators) bought 50 taels from a money changer, reaching an astonishing peak of 3,480 yuan. Near noon, it was heard that Hong Kong was selling foreign exchange, so the foreign exchange market stabilized, and the gold price also dropped by 30 yuan. A certain money changer sold 50 taels to a certain gold shop, with 450 yuan being the noon closing price. In the afternoon, the buying became more intense, and the market opened 50 yuan higher, with money changers trading 50 taels among themselves, with the price being 500 yuan. A certain money changer then aggressively bought over 100 taels, pushing the price up to 550 yuan. Later, because cash firms slightly sold, the price once dropped to 525 yuan. Rumors then arose in the market, coupled with news that foreign exchange was tightening sharply due to lack of support. General speculators became agitated and wildly bought and indiscriminately purchased. Jewelry shops also aggressively bought on behalf of wealthy individuals. Although a certain silver firm released its stock on behalf of a foreign bank, the amount was insufficient to quench the thirst and suppress the momentum. The price then broke through multiple hundred-yuan marks from 3,600 yuan to 900 yuan and 4,000 yuan, and the rising trend was rare. Later, a certain gold shop also aggressively purchased on behalf of its customers, and the jewelry shops also continued to buy, pushing the price higher. As a result, the closing price reached 3,955 yuan, an unprecedented record, an increase of 755 yuan compared to yesterday. It has now risen consecutively for three days, totaling an increase of 1,336 yuan, with a difference of 675 yuan throughout the day. The selling price of the cash firm's gold bars was 10 yuan higher than the spot price. The spot price was around 50 yuan lower than the listed price.</p>
<p>Ornamental Gold Suspends High at 400 Yuan</p>
<p>The exchange rate for gold jewelry in jewelry stores did not initially change. Until 9:45 AM, it was raised by 10 yuan, then raised by another 5 yuan at 9:50 AM, another 5 yuan at 10:05 AM, another 5 yuan at 11:36 AM, another 5 yuan at 2:00 PM, another 5 yuan at 2:10 PM, another 5 yuan at 3:00 PM, sharply increased by 15 yuan at 3:05 PM, another 5 yuan at 3:15 PM, and jumped by 10 yuan at 3:35 PM, and then increased by another 5 yuan at 3:50 PM, totaling an increase of 75 yuan. There was no decline in between. The Dah Tong firm has raised its gold price to 400 yuan, and the Xin Tong firm to 398 yuan. There was no fixed price for buying, which has created a new peak since the market began.</p>
<p>Pure Gold Returns by Half a Penny</p>
<p>London, 19th Dispatch: The price of English pure gold returned by half a penny per ounce, reaching 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 6 pennies, so the buying price of Chinese cash at the central bank also returned to 1,212.3 yuan.</p>
<h3>Startled at the Mention of Tigers – Gold Knocks on the Door of 4,000 Yuan Mark – Rising for Three Consecutive Days…1,336 Yuan – Within a Single Day…Rising 755 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot market situation for gold bars, following consecutive days of skyrocketing and soaring indefinitely, created a shocking record for the gold market. Those who heard about it were startled. The reasons for this are nothing more than the prevalence of rumors in the market, but everyone has different opinions. Here are a few points: (1) It is widely rumored that the British attitude is trending towards softening, and the Tianjin Incident has been left to the Japanese; (2) Rumors of the resignation of certain officials in China have resurfaced in the market. There are countless other baseless rumors, but none are worth a knowledgeable person's consideration. The market immediately jumped 100 yuan higher in the morning, opening at 3,300 yuan. Later, as money changers released their stock on behalf of foreign banks to make a profit, the price once dropped to 3,280 yuan. However, it was heard that the foreign exchange rate continued to contract, so the buyers rallied again, causing the price to skyrocket to a high of 3,480 yuan. Near noon, the arrival of Hong Kong telegrams selling foreign exchange stabilized the foreign exchange market, and the gold price also dropped to a closing price of 3,450 yuan. In the afternoon, the rumors mentioned above suddenly arose, and it was further rumored that the supply of foreign exchange was about to be suspended, and people became more confused. The fervor of wealthy merchants and businessmen buying gold had reached a boiling point. They bought whatever was available and aimed for 4,000 yuan. As a result, the market became turbulent, and the closing price jumped to 3,955 yuan, only 45 yuan away from 4,000. Transactions were very active, with a total volume of around 4,000 taels for the day. Jewelry stores also raised their gold prices eleven times in a row, for a total increase of 75 yuan, creating a record high of 400 yuan. Customs gold remained flat, and British and Chinese pure gold both rose again.</p>
<h3>1,000 Yuan in Remittance Drafts - Exchanged at an 80% Rate</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for remittance drafts, due to the increasingly widespread use of cash, caused the rate per 1,000 yuan to rise from 170 yuan in the morning to as high as 200 yuan. It only slightly decreased in the afternoon, with a rate of 190 yuan, which was 35 yuan higher than the previous day. The money market's interest rate remained unchanged, with both morning and afternoon markets listing 0.16.</p>
<h3>British and American Gold Coins - Jumped by Seventeen or Eighteen Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of pure English gold rose by half a penny, and the exchange rate between British and American currencies decreased by 0.0625. Foreign exchange in the local port, foreign banks and Japanese banks speculators were all absorbing, and the supply from foreign banks could not keep up. The HSBC listed price was contracted, and the market was weak, and violent fluctuations occurred throughout the day. The evening closing price for English exchange was 4 shillings and 375, shrinking by 6525 compared to the previous day, and the American exchange rate was 8.625 yuan, a dramatic drop of 1.1875 yuan. The price of gold bars was high at the opening because the remittance draft market was unusually tight, and people's minds were disturbed. The high price of 3,300 yuan was made, and customers, cash firms, etc., absorbed it very smoothly, and the changes became more and more intense. The noon closing was 450 yuan. In the afternoon, the market atmosphere was even higher, and the opening price was 3,500 yuan. It was heard that remittance drafts were even tighter, and people's hearts were in a state of panic, with a sense of insecurity and a lack of security. The speculators manipulated it, and the wealthy people viewed the legal currency as a worn rag, and the funds were exhausted, and the market price soared. The evening closing price was 3,955 yuan, a sharp increase of 755 yuan compared to the previous day. Due to the sharp drop in the value of paper money, the sharp rise in the price of gold was affected, and the gold price soared unanimously. There was no supply in the market, only the sporadic sales of foreign soldiers and Jewish refugees. There were few public transactions. Shixiang sold the Longchang Jin American dollar bill for 300 yuan. Yesterday's market prices, the price of British gold rose by 18 yuan, the price of British gold ticket rose by 8 yuan and 80 cents, the price of American gold rose by 17.5 yuan, the price of American surplus tickets rose by 3.2 yuan, the price of Hong Kong tickets rose by 45 cents, the price of French franc tickets rose by 34 cents, the price of Singapore tickets rose by 55 cents, the price of Dutch tickets rose by 40 cents, the price of Annam tickets rose by 30 cents, the price of Roby tickets rose by 35 cents, the price of Canadian tickets rose by 1.8 yuan, the price of Philippine tickets rose by 1.1 yuan, the price of Italian tickets rose by 30 cents, the price of German gold tickets rose by 50 cents, the price of Australian gold tickets rose by 3.5 yuan, the price of Swiss tickets rose by 50 cents, and the price of Japanese gold tickets rose along with it, 1 yuan and 11 cents in the evening market, and the price of Korean tickets was 88 cents.</p>
<h3>Securities: The Mystery of Principal and Interest Unveiled; Public Bonds Plunge</h3>
<p>The securities gray market saw another alarming drop yesterday, triggered by a telegram from Chongqing announcing the suspension of principal and interest payments. This officially revealed the mystery and surpassed the sharp price drop on June 22nd due to the Chongqing telegram, hitting a new low. Class A bonds plummeted by over seven yuan. In reality, what the spokesperson said was merely a rehash of old news. This newspaper has repeatedly elaborated on this matter. The so-called suspension of principal and interest is intended for external purposes, in order to maintain uniformity. Therefore, banks were separately instructed to offer discounting services. If discounting is available, bondholders can still receive principal and interest, albeit with a loss of interest. It is reported that many short sellers in the market borrowed heavily from relatives and friends to deliver, and even students were heavily shorting. Their sole goal was to await the emergence of large institutional bulls, repeatedly spreading rumors. In reality, the large bulls had already distributed their holdings. If they were to cover their short positions, the rebound would be astonishing. Yesterday's trading saw an initial sharp drop of two or three yuan due to selling by Yuan Da and No. 16 companies. Songmao acted on behalf of a major institutional investor to sell, and No. 35 and Lianyi also sold on behalf of clients, pushing the market price down another two or three yuan. Later, Dian Yuan, Tiansheng, Tongshun, Hengfu, and general retail investors took advantage of the low prices to buy, allowing prices to recover by varying amounts of one, two, or three yuan. The market stabilized considerably after the close. Ultimately, prices fell by two yuan six and a half cents to four yuan and a half cents compared to the previous day. The total turnover was estimated at over 1.1 million yuan. A summary table is provided below.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Yarn Industry Is Dazed and Manic; Treated Like Foreign Exchange; Double Horse Yarn Jumps 20 Yuan; Spot Transactions Decrease Instead</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to rise, with the upward trend intensifying. The continuous shrinking of foreign exchange rates, coupled with soaring gold prices, has dragged the yarn market into a vortex. Generally, cotton yarn is treated like cash and foreign exchange. The prevailing mentality is to correlate changes in foreign exchange rates to the yarn market, thus expanding the range of yarn price fluctuations. As for actual transactions by trading houses, amidst this crazy and distorted situation, the upward trend is so drastic that they are dazed and confused, unsure of where to start, with no standard to follow. Consequently, spot yarn transactions have decreased significantly, and the situation appears passive instead. After the close, the price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was pushed to 545 yuan, and those holding the goods were still unwilling to sell. From a psychological perspective, the market is bullish, but this situation is excessively heated.</p>
<p>Current Yarn Market Conditions: At the opening of the market this morning, traders gathered and unanimously expected prices to rise. Prices remained firm, with opening prices increasing by 5 yuan. The selling price of 20-count Double Horse yarn for foreign godowns was 526 yuan, and the godown receipt price was 519 yuan. The situation was still calm at this time. Shortly afterward, buyers surged again, and the market price tightened further, because although gold prices were high, the high discounting rate for banknotes somewhat evened things out. By 11 o'clock, the market situation suddenly changed, and buyers swarmed in, claiming that the shrinking trend of the British exchange rate had started again, breaking through 5 pence, and gold prices had reached a new high. Therefore, the selling price jumped 10 yuan in an instant, but there were very few sellers. The closing price of 20-count Double Horse yarn for foreign godowns was 540 yuan, and the godown receipt price was 530 yuan. It is estimated that less than 1,000 bales were traded in half a day, with fellow traders accounting for 665 bales. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn rose by 20 yuan, and Shepherd rose by 7.5 yuan. The quantities purchased by various trading houses are listed on the left: Hong Kong: 280 bales; Fellow Traders: 665 bales; Mainland: 50 bales; Total: 995 bales.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market has also risen, but actual demand is scarce due to the financial tightening. However, in anticipation of the shrinking exchange rate for next month's goods, speculative buyers have flocked in, pushing up market prices. The current asking price for 20-count Yueqin yarn is 417 yuan, a rise of 3 or 4 yuan.</p>
<p>Banknote Funds Are Dwindling; Cotton Merchants Are Settling Prices for Forward Contracts; Only Three Transactions in Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market was weak in the morning. Telegrams from Liverpool and Mumbai reported declines. There was significant hedging selling in the South, and there was no improvement in the middle of the day. In the third session, trading among traders increased, and there was also a lot of short covering. As a result, the market price rebounded by 10 points, resulting in the highest closing price. The closing price in India fell by one rupee, but the forecast was for a rise of over two rupees, offsetting the fall and still resulting in a rise of one and a half rupees. The price in Egypt fell by 5 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: No new transactions have been reported for several weeks. Since the sharp contraction in exchange rates on Tuesday, wealthy individuals have rushed to purchase foreign exchange, resulting in large sums of banknotes being transferred to banks on the Bund. At the same time, the demand for banknotes has increased daily, while the funds available have dwindled, causing the discounting rate to rise sharply and leading to increasing financial difficulties. Aware of this situation, traders who had previously placed orders, fearing that they would have difficulty raising funds when the goods arrived, and considering that they could still make a substantial profit before the goods were shipped, settled prices with foreign firms, which was the best policy.</p>
<p>Another report: Transactions in native cotton have ceased again. In general, the chaotic situation has made negotiations difficult, and the parties have been unable to reach an agreement. However, Indian cotton traders still conducted two trades, with prices increasing by 3 yuan. Hong Tong Factory purchased 130 bales of 32-count to 40-count Brazilian cotton for 140 yuan, which was the factory-delivered price including exchange costs. Other manufacturers showed little activity. Due to the storms and two hurricanes in Northern Jiangsu yesterday, shipping was suspended, so no goods arrived in Shanghai. The current situation of spot cotton is as follows: Hwui Si Teng: 110.00; Middle traders: 200 bales; Banknote settlement Brazilian cotton: 140.00; Also 130 bales; Exchange plus Bailuo to: 100.00; Also 100 bales; Banknote plus.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Public Sentiment Is Volatile; General Public Is Stockpiling Cotton Cloth Again</h3>
<p>Native Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign exchange rates contracted again, and discounting rates rose sharply. Public sentiment in the market was volatile, and the atmosphere of stockpiling spot goods in the hope of mitigating currency devaluation became increasingly prevalent. Native cloth transactions still typically use exchange rates for pricing. With the discounting rate currently soaring to 200 yuan, native cloth is now generally cheaper than Dongye cloth. Therefore, it has aroused the interest of general stockpilers, and stockpiling has become enthusiastic again. Spot demand has also rebounded. The asking price for coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, and coarse twill has increased by 5 cents to 20 cents per piece. Colored cloth, colored twill, printed and dyed goods have all seen increases in raw material and bleaching costs, and asking prices have also increased by 10 cents to 25 cents per piece. British merchants' spot prices for various goods remain unchanged. Sales to stockpilers are the strongest, with an estimated 200+ bales of fine twill, fine cloth, and coarse cloth sold, as well as 100+ cases of colored cloth, colored twill, serge, woolen fabric, and printed flannel. Dyeing factories purchased 200+ bales of grey cloth, fine cloth, and fine twill. Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Nanyang traders purchased 100+ bales of fine twill, and 100+ cases of colored cloth and colored twill. 2000+ pieces of colored cloth, colored twill, and bleached goods were sold. Sichuan and Yunnan traders purchased 100+ bales of blue cloth, colored twill, printed goods, and woolen fabric.</p>
<p>Dongye Cloth</p>
<p>The market for white cloth has continued to be robust due to trading between insiders and outsiders. Fine cloth and fine materials have trended upward again. 12-pound Dragon Head fine cloth is currently priced at 14 yuan 40 cents for spot goods and 14 yuan 60 cents for forward contracts. In the afternoon, actual sales of grey cloth also started, further bolstering the market momentum. Although the spot discounting rate is rising to around 200 yuan, spot and forward orders for fine cloth and fine twill still amounted to an estimated 1,000 pieces throughout the day.</p>
<h3>Oil Cakes: Oil Is Extremely Expensive</h3>
<p>Raw Oil: Hong Kong is actively procuring supplies, and with gold prices rising steadily, the market has been strongly encouraged and prices have surged again, rising by 50 cents to 1.67 yuan compared to the previous day. A total of 600 cases of Jiaozhou oil in baskets, 1,500 cans of new tin-plated oil, 1,000 cans of Yantai tin-plated oil, 50+ barrels of Qingdao iron-drum oil, and 50 barrels of Dalian iron-drum oil have been transacted. Market prices are detailed in the market price section for reference.</p>
<p>Soybean Oil: Public sentiment remains bullish, and market prices continue to increase by 20-30 cents. 200 cases of Jiaozhou oil were transacted at prices ranging from 34.80 yuan to 35.20 yuan. 100 cases of Qingqi oil were transacted at a price of 35.20 yuan. 100 cases of Yanqi oil were transacted at a price of 35.80 yuan. 1,000 cans of Tianjin tin-plated oil were transacted at 45.50 yuan. 50 barrels of Dalian oil were transacted at 48.70 yuan. 60 barrels of Kobe-Dalian oil were transacted at prices ranging from 48.70 yuan to 49 yuan.</p>

<h3>Japanese Side Madly Scrambling Again; Black Market Foreign Exchange Tightens Again; Gold Prices Soar Near the 4,000 Yuan Mark; Small Denomination Banknotes with Place Names in North China Are Still Accepted for Redemption; Speculators May Face Dire Losses</h3>
<p>After the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee restricted the supply of foreign exchange to prevent arbitrage, the Japanese bank's scrambling caused the black market exchange rate to contract again. Due to speculators' manipulation, gold prices have soared to new records. The discount on exchange rates has risen to a staggering 200 yuan. The entire Chinese financial system has been affected. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Exchange Market Received Another Shock Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the English-language *Shanghai Evening Post &amp; Mercury*, the exchange market in Shanghai received another shock this morning (20th). The market opened at yesterday's (19th) closing rate, but the demand for foreign exchange from various buyers was very strong, while the supply from exporters and speculators was quite limited. As a result, the exchange rate continued to fall. At around 10 a.m., the telegraphic transfer rate for U.S. dollars was 9.6875 yuan, but it shrank to 9.25 yuan at noon. The telegraphic transfer rate for British pounds also fell from 5 and 1/4 pence to 4 and 3/4 pence within two hours, meaning that 10.81 yuan in legal tender was needed to exchange for one U.S. dollar, and 50.50 yuan in legal tender was equivalent to one British pound. The exchange rate for U.S. dollars in exchange shops once rose as high as 11 yuan in legal tender to exchange for one U.S. dollar.</p>
<h3>All Parties Are Concerned About the Natural Level</h3>
<p>Neither Hong Kong nor Chongqing has issued any news regarding the intentions of the central government or the Equalization Fund, so the market remains completely unaware of what will happen. The question of greatest concern to the public is what exchange rate the Equalization Fund will recognize as the new natural level of legal tender, and how it will resume selling foreign exchange, as well as the circumstances under which foreign exchange will be sold in the future. From the perspective of China's legal tender reserve, the current exchange rate in Shanghai seems to be indeed devaluing the value of legal tender.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Reserves Are Exceptionally Ample</h3>
<p>At the beginning of this month, the total amount of currency in circulation issued by the central government's banks was 200 billion yuan. According to reliable sources, its foreign exchange reserve is equivalent to 20 million pounds sterling based on its parity to this circulating currency amount. At the current exchange rate, these 20 million pounds are sufficient to cover foreign exchange and parity requirements, reaching about 15% of the total value of legal tender. This figure further convinces people that the Shanghai market seems to be under heavy pressure from foreign exchange buyers. Speculators may suffer significant losses if they rashly purchase foreign exchange.</p>
<h3>"Hongkou Currency" Finally Collapses</h3>
<p>As for the "Hongkou currency," the Chinese side has finally achieved its goal. This morning, the Huaxing Bank has ceased to follow the legal tender exchange rate for the Huaxing currency and has set a rate of six pence, which is one-quarter higher than the legal tender. Therefore, the "Hongkou currency" has superficially abandoned its parity with the legal tender. However, the Shanghai public has no intention of exchanging "Hongkou currency" at a discount to legal tender. The Japanese yen rose sharply for the first time this morning amidst the current devaluation of legal tender. Its market price was 1.04 yuan in legal tender for buying and 1.035 yuan for selling. Ten-ounce gold bars rose to an even higher level again this morning, opening at 3,300 yuan and closing at 3,450 yuan in the black market at noon, the highest price seen in many years.</p>
<p>Japanese Side Madly Scrambling Again</p>
<p>After the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market, the foreign exchange market gradually stabilized because the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) continued to supply as much foreign exchange as possible to meet the legitimate needs of various industries. Yesterday morning, HSBC quoted British pounds at 5 pence and U.S. dollars at 9.6875 yuan, the same as the previous day's quoted prices. Later, the Japanese bank started scrambling again, causing the market to become tense again. At 9:50 a.m., HSBC lowered its quoted prices, with British pounds at 4.75 pence and U.S. dollars at 9.25 yuan. As a result, public sentiment was volatile and the market became chaotic again. Subsequently, Hong Kong allowed for supply and sale, and public sentiment became more stable and the market price gradually eased.</p>
<p>French Exchange Rate Stabilized</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance continues to maintain its original policy for statutory foreign exchange rates. Therefore, yesterday's statutory foreign exchange rates at the Central Bank were 1 shilling 2 and a half pence for British pounds and 30 U.S. dollars. As for the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's decision to restrict the supply of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market, the intention is to prevent certain parties from engaging in speculative arbitrage. Therefore, the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market has no impact on the overall currency credit. At the same time, the national financial system remains stable, and the foundation of various banks is becoming increasingly solid. Moreover, unlimited supply of foreign exchange to regions that are beyond the reach of wartime political power is detrimental rather than beneficial to the war of resistance.</p>
<p>Prevent Speculative Arbitrage</p>
<p>For the import of non-prohibited goods, applying to the Foreign Exchange Examination Committee to purchase statutory foreign exchange proves that the Chinese government still supplies foreign exchange at the statutory price for legitimate needs, and does not change its policy due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the black market. As for the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee's policy towards foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market, it is not that it is not supplied at all, but that it is restricted to prevent certain parties from engaging in speculative arbitrage. Therefore, British HSBC and other banks still supply as much foreign exchange as possible to meet the legitimate needs of various industries, but purchases must be made with a purchase order. The restrictions on swaps are intended to eliminate the manipulation of speculators.</p>
<p>Redemption of Small Denomination Banknotes</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of banknotes with place names in North China (Tianjin), the reporter from *New Voice* learned from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications yesterday that their branch offices, in addition to telegraphing their head offices for instructions, have already consulted and reached a proper solution. Today, they have decided to redeem these banknotes at face value, but in order to prevent large-scale transfers to Shanghai to arbitrage foreign exchange, they have to impose appropriate restrictions on large amounts. Today, the Shanghai branch offices of the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications are redeeming small amounts of banknotes as much as possible, which proves that these banknotes are still valid. It has now been decided to continue redemption, and it is hoped that all sectors will not refuse to accept banknotes from Zhejiang Xingye, China Industrial, Communications, Ningbo Commercial, Agricultural Commercial, Agricultural and Industrial, and Zhejiang localities.</p>
<p>Gold Prices Soar</p>
<p>After the black market for cash soared due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, reaching new records, speculators rushed to buy gold. Yesterday, the black market closed at an astonishing 3,955 yuan, an unprecedented level in history. Major silver shops changed their listed prices in the afternoon, with major shops listing 400 yuan and new shops listing 398 yuan. General observations suggest that due to the manipulation of speculators, the cash price may break through the 4,000 yuan mark. In addition, the discount on exchange rates continued to soar due to the need for cash among speculators who requested discounts from small money shops using exchange rate bills. Yesterday, it rose to a staggering 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Silver Industry Regular Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Banking Association held a regular meeting of its Executive Committee at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Wu Yunji, Ye Fuxiao, Lin Kanghou, Pan Jiufen, and others attended. The meeting was chaired by Wu Yunzhai and recorded by Gu Chengan. In addition to reporting on the association's activities for the week, the meeting adjourned at 2:30 p.m. According to the association's secretary, speaking to the *New Voice* reporter, there were no proposals at yesterday's Executive Committee meeting. Rumors that the association discussed: The sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the black market; The redemption of banknotes with place names in Tianjin; were not true, because the association had no need to discuss the above two issues.</p>
<p>Financial Stability</p>
<p>The *New Voice* reporter learned from the silver and money industry yesterday that since the Ministry of Finance restricted withdrawals and deposits, the run on banks has subsided, rumors have disappeared, and public sentiment has stabilized. The new remittance system of the Bank Association's Joint Reserve Committee, which took effect on July 4th, has been quite effective. The market has suddenly become flexible, and various industries have indirectly and directly benefited greatly. The various interest rates of the silver and money industry remain unchanged. The four-bank discount committee of the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank continues to do its utmost to regulate the financial affairs of the industry. Therefore, the financial market remains stable as always. The soaring cash prices, falling securities prices, and sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the black market are all caused by the manipulation of speculative elements.</p>
<h3>Japan Claims British Troops Wounded Workers; All Utter Nonsense; British Side Thoroughly Investigated and Found No Such Thing; Japan Even Considers It Intentional Insult</h3>
<p>According to *North-China Daily News*, a Japanese news agency reported that since the British military authorities refused to acknowledge that a sentry from the Eastern Surrey Regiment stabbed a Chinese railway worker on Sunday morning, the Central China Railway Company has threatened to refuse to provide convenience to the British and British goods. The reporter asked an official at the British Consulate yesterday (19th) about this matter, who said that the British military authorities had conducted a thorough investigation and found no stabbing incident. The Japanese news agency also said that the Railway Company claimed that the British military authorities' refusal to acknowledge the incident was "intentional insult," while British Major Ashmore called the Japanese side's accusation "utter nonsense." According to Inoue, Deputy Director of the Business Department of the Central China Railway Company, the company believes that the railways are the transportation lifeline for building a new China, providing rapid and safe transportation to Chinese, Japanese, and third-country nationals and their goods. Therefore, the company believes that the unjustified injury of a worker is most regrettable. This kind of action is actually hindering the duties of those engaged in building a new order in East Asia. The Central China Railway Company has the intention of making a request through established channels, and the attitude taken by the British authorities will determine what steps will be taken. If it is discovered that the British intend to be hostile to the establishment of peace and order in Central China, the company may be forced to refuse to transport the British and British goods. It is reported that the Japanese side has not lodged a protest with the British military or consular authorities yesterday. An official at the British Consulate said that if such a protest arrives, we will take appropriate steps.</p>
<h3>Securities Gray Market Plunges Yesterday; But the Four Banks, for the Sake of Stabilizing the Market, Will Allow Discounting and Collateralized Lending Starting from the End of July</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance issued a notice on January 15th stipulating the method of paying off domestic and foreign debts guaranteed by customs duties after the interception of customs duties, it was unavoidable to temporarily suspend the payment of principal and interest due on the seventh installment of the 1926 National Unification Public Bonds due on July 31st. However, the Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Agricultural Bank, and Farmers Bank, for the sake of stabilizing the market, will allow the discounting and collateralized lending of principal and interest coupons. The four banks will issue "discount certificates," which will be processed starting from the end of July. The Shanghai Securities Gray Market was triggered yesterday morning by a telegram from the Chongqing Ministry of Finance spokesperson stating that the National Unification Public Bonds were suspending principal and interest payments. General retail investors became panicked, and selling pressure suddenly intensified, causing prices to fall. The closing prices are recorded below: National Unification Class A: 52.80 yuan, down 9.60 yuan; Class B: 44.40 yuan, down 3.05 yuan; Class C: 43.05 yuan, down 3.40 yuan; Class D: 42.00 yuan, down 3.90 yuan; Class E: 43.35 yuan, down 2.65 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hurricane Sweeps Through Western Shanghai, Fortunately Not a Direct Hit; Wind Force Diminishes After Landfall; Surprising Rapid Change in Wind Direction; Significant Tidal Surge in the Huangpu River Floods Roads</h3>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory reported at 6:00 AM yesterday that after making landfall in Hangzhou Bay, the hurricane had advanced to 119 degrees east longitude and 30 degrees north latitude, heading north-northwest. The wind force had gradually diminished after landfall. Shanghai was not directly hit by the hurricane, which passed near Hangzhou, west of Shanghai. However, due to the influence of the hurricane, the weather changed abruptly, with showers and strong winds. The Jianghai Customs and the signal tower on Lan Road had displayed two red lights, representing two black balls, from the night before, warning ships not to enter or leave the port.</p>
<p>Black Ball Lowered, Navigation Resumes</p>
<p>After the hurricane passed west of Shanghai, the Jianghai Customs and Lan Road signal tower hoisted one black ball yesterday morning, warning ships to remain on alert. By 2:00 PM yesterday, the black ball was lowered, and ships in the Huangpu River fully resumed navigation. Vessels from the Taikoo, Jardine Matheson, and Northern and Southern routes, as well as ships on the lower Yangtze River, all entered and left the Huangpu River as usual. Fortunately, Shanghai was not directly hit; otherwise, the high tide in the Huangpu River yesterday morning would have caused significant losses to the city. However, some warehouses were flooded, causing minor water damage to a small amount of goods.</p>
<p>To Dissipate Between Nanjing and Wuhu</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory reported at 6:00 PM yesterday that the hurricane had advanced to 118.40 degrees east longitude and 31 degrees north latitude, heading west-northwest, and was expected to dissipate between Nanjing and Wuhu. The wind force had diminished to level four to five, and it might dissipate there. The Hangzhou Bay area in Zhejiang, as well as areas near Hangzhou, were hit by the hurricane, resulting in substantial local losses.</p>
<p>Huangpu River High Tide Almost Reaches the Bank</p>
<p>Due to repeated strikes by the hurricane, the tide level of the Huangpu River was also significantly raised. The high tide at 3:15 AM today measured a significant 11 feet 2 inches. The high tide at 4:00 PM this afternoon was 9 feet 6 inches. The high tide at 4:02 AM tomorrow (the 22nd) is expected to be 11 feet, and the high tide at 4:55 PM tomorrow is expected to be 9 feet 4.4 inches. The height of the Bund embankment is 13 feet, so the high tide is very close to the bank.</p>
<p>Low-Lying Roads Become a Vast Expanse of Water</p>
<p>After a period of storms and rain, lower-lying areas such as Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Fuzhou Road, Nanjing Road, Yinhua Street, Zhejiang Road, Guizhou Road, Guangxi Road, Avenue Edward VII, Xinzha Road, Route Tenant de la Tour, Avenue Joffre in the French Concession, Ximen Road, Route Cardinal Mercier, Avenue Foch, and Route Paul Henry Vignon, were flooded due to the rainwater not draining in time and the backflow of the Huangpu River's high tide, turning them into watery expanses. This was especially severe in western Shanghai and had not receded completely last night.</p>
<p>Outbound Sea Shipping is Hampered</p>
<p>The two black balls on the Jianghai Customs clock tower were removed yesterday, and the hurricane warning was lifted. However, the southeast wind remained strong, and the waves in the Huangpu River were still turbulent, preventing a full resumption of shipping. The situation of various ships yesterday is recorded below. The Shandong ship from Qingdao only entered the port around 5:00 PM. The British Sudan, returning to Shanghai from Tianjin, and the Blue Funnel Line's Antenor, arriving in Shanghai from Liverpool, had not reported entering the port to the customs by 6:00 PM. However, the company stated that they had not received any delayed telegrams and expected them to arrive in Shanghai last night or this morning. The Sudan was originally scheduled to depart for Europe today, but due to the delay, the return trip to Europe would also be postponed by one day. Ships traveling on the lower Yangtze River had not arrived in port by 8:00 PM yesterday. Only the Japanese Da Hua ship returned to Shanghai from Xin Gang at 5:10 PM yesterday and docked at the Bund No. 3 wharf. Ships returning to Shanghai last night are expected to depart as usual this morning. If they could not return to Shanghai last night, there will be no ships for export today. Jardine Matheson's Tung Wah ship could not return to Shanghai yesterday due to the storm and is now scheduled to enter the port tomorrow. The Ewo ship, originally scheduled to depart for Beisha yesterday morning, is sheltering from the storm in Shanghai and is now scheduled to depart tomorrow morning. The French Messageries Maritimes' General Joffre, arriving in Shanghai from Marseille, was not affected by the hurricane and is expected to arrive in Shanghai at 5:00 PM this afternoon as scheduled, docking at the Hongkou Gonghexing wharf. The connecting ferry carrying passengers will disembark at the New Customs wharf around 6:00 PM this afternoon. The American President Lines' President Coolidge departed at 5:40 PM yesterday afternoon for Hong Kong and Luzon. Jardine Matheson's Fu Sheng also departed for Hong Kong yesterday morning. The Taikoo Jinan and Jardine Matheson's Kuei Sheng were scheduled to depart yesterday according to the schedule, but due to the hurricane report in Kobe, Japan, passengers and cargo could not be loaded as scheduled, so they were rescheduled to depart today. The Shanghai-Ningbo route's De Ping and Hana were originally scheduled to depart this morning, but were also delayed by one day due to the hurricane and the failure to load passengers and cargo. Passengers traveling on these two ships must board the ship tonight. It is also reported that the Moufu ship sailed to Jintang Island to shelter from the storm the night before due to the large storm surge outside Zhenhai. Yesterday afternoon, it had sailed back to the outer blockade line and is expected to return to Shanghai from Zhenhai with miscellaneous cargo on the 23rd.</p>
<p>The Fate of An Li Passengers is Uncertain</p>
<p>The Swedish Ruifeng Foreign Company's Xin An Li steamer departed from Shanghai for Dinghai on the 6th of this month, but was stopped by a Japanese warship in the Daishan waters. The compradore Kuan Chunsun and four crew members were detained for several days. After negotiations between the company and the headquarters of the Japanese Third Fleet, permission to resume navigation was granted. Therefore, a Tong was released on the 16th and hired three Hengfeng tugboats to tow three sailing boats, carrying more than 100 passengers and a large amount of local produce, to Shanghai. On the 18th, the tug arrived in the Tongsha waters. Due to the hurricane, the ship cables broke, and one sailing boat, carrying Tong and more than 30 passengers, drifted away and their fate is unknown. The remaining passengers and crew arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 PM the night before. It is reported that the company is now seeking assistance from all parties to search for the missing crew members and sailing boat.</p>
<p>Part of the Japanese Telegraph Line is Interrupted</p>
<p>According to the English-language "Great American Evening Post", the wind force of this hurricane shifted north, but its speed of movement was quite surprising. The hurricane has already traveled a long distance over land and may have lost much of its intensity. Therefore, Nanjing should not be as severely affected as coastal towns. According to Japanese newspapers, the tail of the hurricane broke part of the Japanese government's telegraph line between Shanghai and Nagasaki, and telephone services between Nanjing and Shanghai were also interrupted due to the strong winds. Japan-China Airlines flights were all ordered to be suspended yesterday (the 19th). There were no reports of damage to any airports.</p>
<h3>Affected by Foreign Exchange and the Hurricane, Rice Prices Rose Again Yesterday; Reduced Rice Reserves Are a Natural Phenomenon; Trend Remains Stable in the Absence of Special Circumstances</h3>
<p>After the Concession authorities stipulated a maximum price for domestic rice from the 17th of this month, with the highest grade of white japonica rice not exceeding 20 yuan and the highest grade of Kehsien rice not exceeding 16 yuan, all domestic rice was traded below the price limit. Starting yesterday, due to the sharp contraction of the black market foreign exchange, the quoted price of foreign rice increased, and grain merchants have stopped ordering. At the same time, due to the hurricane, it is feared that the early rice crops in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces will be affected, causing rice merchants to refuse to sell, and prices are expected to rise. As a result, the price of all rice in the market increased by 20 to 30 cents, and the genuine top-grade white japonica rice and Kehsien rice are not being sold in the market.</p>
<p>The Guild Announces the Total Amount of Rice Reserves</p>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Guild announced yesterday that the total amount of rice reserves in Shanghai is 300,481 bags, a decrease of 44,421 bags compared to last week. The warehouses storing the most rice are those of the Bank of China, China Industrial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and Shanghai Bank. It was also learned from rice industry groups that the early rice crops in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces were slightly affected by the hurricane, while the late rice crops were not affected because they were not yet mature. The transportation of Kehsien rice from Wuhu to Shanghai has recently been obstructed by the Japanese, and merchants are currently negotiating for a solution.</p>
<p>Rice Reserves Still Sufficient for Three Months</p>
<p>According to rice industry insiders, the decrease in rice reserves is a natural phenomenon that occurs every year during this period. As for the total rice reserves in the city, including those in rice shops and those purchased and stored by citizens, it is estimated to be close to 300,000 bags. Based on the monthly consumption, the current rice reserves are still sufficient for three months.</p>
<h3>The New Fourth Army in Western Shanghai Has a Strong Military Appearance</h3>
<p>A unit of the New Fourth Army, active in the Suzhou-Changzhou area, has been ordered to station in the guerrilla area of western Shanghai. This unit of the New Fourth Army arrived by roundabout routes, numbering more than a brigade, led by its commander. The soldiers wore steel helmets, cloth uniforms, and straw sandals, and were well-organized and formidable. The weapons they carried, rifles, were all Type 38 rifles manufactured in Showa 10 (1935), and light and heavy machine guns and small steel cannons were also manufactured in a certain country, all captured from the Japanese army. However, the Mauser pistols and hand grenades were the latest Chinese-made models. The average age of the soldiers was between sixteen and twenty-five, with no old or weak individuals. They arrived in the towns of western Shanghai on the 15th of this month.</p>
<h3>The Coolidge and a Japanese Ship Collide; Both Ships Sustain Minor Damage; Due to High Winds and Waves</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the President Coolidge collided in the Huangpu River with the Japanese cargo ship Nisshin Maru shortly after arriving here from Japan yesterday (the 19th). Two passengers on the President Coolidge were nearly injured. The incident occurred at 1:45 PM. The giant trans-Pacific liner President Coolidge was turning around to point its bow south. It is reported that both ships sustained minor damage. The Japanese ship immediately</p>
<p>sailed into the sea after the collision, while the President Coolidge is scheduled to continue its voyage to Hong Kong at 5:00 PM today (the 20th). According to an eyewitness who spoke to a reporter last night, the President Coolidge was hit in the mid-section of its hull. One of the large steel plates on the promenade deck was dented, and part of the first-class dining room and one of the lower cabins were also damaged. When the two ships collided, two passengers on the President Coolidge were in their cabins. Although the cabin windows were pierced and the glass shattered, both managed to avoid injury. When the President Coolidge was</p>
<p>completely stopped near buoy number twelve, the Japanese ship Nisshin Maru was five hundred yards away, drifting downstream. Its engine had apparently been turned off. Another Japanese ship, Nagasaki Maru, was not far away, entering the Wusongkou a few minutes after the President Coolidge. However, it had sailed to the American ship in the Huangpu River before. The wind was strong at the time of the incident. The Japanese ship Nisshin Maru was sailing against the wind and eventually sailed near buoy number twelve, realizing it had lost control and collided with the President Coolidge. The</p>
<p>damage to the Nisshin Maru was mostly on the bow, thirty feet or more above the waterline. Although there was a slight commotion on the President Coolidge, everything was under perfect control. Engineers from the President Lines were immediately dispatched to board the ship for investigation. According to them, the ship sustained minor damage and should not be prevented from sailing south. According to President Lines personnel, the ship may sail to Hong Kong for necessary repairs.</p>
<h3>Copper Auxiliary Coin Vouchers to be Issued Soon; Shipped to Shanghai by Ship in Early Next Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Guild, and other public organizations telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting it to consider Shanghai's economic situation and promptly print and ship auxiliary coin vouchers to Shanghai for circulation. Upon receiving the telegram, the Ministry of Finance immediately instructed the Central Bank to entrust the Hong Kong Book Bureau to print new auxiliary coin vouchers, with a total issue amount of 2 million yuan, including denominations of one, two, and five cents, to be issued in four batches. It is learned that the first batch of 500,000 yuan of the new auxiliary coin vouchers will be printed and completed and can be shipped to Shanghai by ship from Hong Kong in early next month to begin distribution.</p>
<h3>White Russian Summer Resorts Repeatedly Obstructed</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the White Russian Emigration Committee on Rue Molière is now openly assisting Japanese ships, placing various obstacles in the way of White Russian immigrants applying for passports to travel to various ports in the occupied areas on non-Japanese ships. The common practice is to not approve passports for White Russians who want to go to Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other places for summer vacation, or who want to embark on British ships or</p>
<p>other foreign ships. They are sometimes forced to wait two or three weeks before the necessary documents are issued. Moreover, the committee openly tells most White Russians that this delay is because they want to travel on non-Japanese ships. There are also several White Russians who have applied for the approval of passports and want to embark on non-Japanese ships. The committee openly tells them that</p>
<p>it is better to travel on Japanese ships. Otherwise, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to obtain passport approval. Yesterday (the 19th), it was learned that this action by the White Russian Emigration Committee, although not having a major impact on the shipping of third countries, also has slight signs of an anti-British movement being carried out by the Japanese, because British shipping companies are</p>
<p>more affected by this action than all other shipping companies. Most of those who go to Qingdao and Yantai for summer vacation this summer are White Russians. Although few of them travel in first class, the income from carrying passengers to these resorts from White Russians is also quite considerable.</p>
<h3>Rear Admiral Hepner Unwilling to Express His Feelings; Only Smiles and Says He Had a Comfortable Voyage; To Cruise in North China After Taking Office</h3>
<p>Rear Admiral Hepner, the new commander of the Asian Fleet, arrived in Shanghai on the 19th with his wife and two daughters on the President Coolidge to take office. Admiral Yarnell, the commander of the outgoing Asian Fleet, General Glassford, commander of the Yangtze River Patrol, and Yarnell's chief of staff, Colonel Connell, were all at the dock to welcome him. After landing, Rear Admiral Hepner and his wife</p>
<p>accompanied Yarnell in the same car to the 13-story building on Avenue Albert for a rest. Chief of Staff Colonel Karle, who will replace Connell, came with Rear Admiral Hepner. Hepner's inauguration ceremony will be held together with the handover ceremony. When reporters asked him about his feelings and opinions about this trip, Hepner repeatedly shook his head and smiled, saying that he had</p>
<p>no feelings and no plans to announce, only saying that he had a comfortable voyage. Hepner graduated from the Naval Academy in 1899. From 1920 to 1922, he participated in the Spanish campaign and served on the British Channel Fleet. From 1922 to 1927, he was promoted to fleet commander and led the team in the</p>
<p>largest river in the United States, the Mississippi River. In 1929, he was promoted to rear admiral and was responsible for the defense of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In 1935, he served as the chairman of the General Board of the Navy Department in Washington. He recently left office. Rear Admiral Hepner's trip is his</p>
<p>second visit to China. His first visit to China was fifteen years ago, when Rear Admiral Hepner was serving as the commander of submarines of the Asian Fleet stationed in the Eastern seas. The submarine carried him from Manila to Qingdao. Rear Admiral Hepner is scheduled to take office on the 25th of this month and will cruise in North China in early next month.</p>

<h3>Exemption from Taxes and Unified Purchase; Exports Break New Records; However, Imports Continue to Increase in Occupied Ports; But the Mainland Can Save More Than Ten Million Pounds Annually</h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice Agency learned from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications yesterday that Shanghai's situation is special. The requirement to sell foreign exchange for export goods to the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications has not yet been implemented. Therefore, the import of necessities can be applied for foreign exchange from the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, but no orders have been received from the Ministry of Finance or the head office. It was also learned from the Customs that since the occupation of Shanghai, the Jianghai Customs has not implemented the requirement to settle foreign exchange for export goods, and the prohibition of imports of luxury goods and non-essential goods due to environmental reasons. Therefore, the import of luxury goods from the occupied areas remains the same. However, these luxury goods are only allowed to be sold in the occupied areas and are absolutely prohibited from being re-exported to non-occupied areas.</p>
<p>Promote the Export Trade of Local Goods</p>
<p>In order to promote the export trade of local goods, the method of settling foreign exchange and receiving exchange rate differences for export goods is stipulated, allowing local goods to be freely transported and sold to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. However, the foreign exchange obtained from the export of local goods should still be sold to the Bank of China or the Bank of Communications. In addition, the provinces are instructed to make efforts to increase production, exempt export taxes on local goods, and provide insurance and facilitate transportation. The four categories of tung oil, tea, bristles, and minerals are purchased by the two regulatory agencies as much as possible, and designated new transportation lines are used to transport them to the port for centralized export. The export of local goods in the first few months of this year has increased to 83,541,327 yuan, creating the highest new record since the war. It is expected that the export value will further increase in the future.</p>
<p>Restrict Imports and Reduce Trade Deficit</p>
<p>After adjusting international trade and promulgating the method of prohibiting the import of goods, all designated luxury goods and non-essential goods, totaling 234 tariff items, are prohibited from import, as well as re-export to non-occupied areas, with the aim of reducing the trade deficit. Because the trade deficit of each port has increased sharply, taking May as an example, the trade deficit was as high as 90,585,697 yuan. Now, all ports in the non-occupied areas have been ordered to implement the import ban, so the trade deficit figures may gradually decrease, so that the whole price trade can be balanced and the adverse trend of international balance of payments can be reversed. This method is a necessary measure during wartime. After the ban, more than 23 million yuan, or 13 million pounds in gold, can be saved each year.</p>
<h3>Bank Employee Gambling and Embezzlement Sentenced</h3>
<p>Fang Shanle, an employee of the Guangdong Bank at the intersection of Ningbo Road and Jiangxi Road, was heavily in debt due to gambling. He had no choice but to engage in private malpractice.

Chinese Detective Jiang Shangpei arrested Fang and sent him to the First Special Court. Attorney Ru Baoyi of the Inspectorate prosecuted him for embezzlement. After the trial was concluded, Judge Feng Shide announced the verdict in the Criminal Court One yesterday morning. Fang Xile was sentenced to eight months in prison as a warning. In addition, in the civil lawsuit, Fang should return 38,728.7 yuan to the Guangdong Bank.</p>
<h3>Gang Robbery of Female Fortune Teller; Principal Offender Continued to be Apprehended; Three Offenders Tried Together</h3>
<p>Jiang Tianzhen, a female fortune teller who was once a dancer, is 23 years old and a native of Hangzhou. After studying with female fortune teller Ling Qing, she has been offering her services at Room 511 of the Oriental Hotel on Yu Qiaqing Road for six years. However, Jiang was often coveted by bandits because of her modern attire and dazzling diamond rings. At 7:45 PM on the 8th of last month, a Liu, a guest from Room 316 of the Far East Hotel, summoned Jiang Tianzhen to tell his fortune. Jiang</p>
<p>went in full dress. After the fortune telling, she was threatened with a gun by people in the room and tied to a water pipe. A diamond ring worth 600 yuan and cash and other items were robbed and the robbers escaped. After reporting to the Old Zhabei Police Station for investigation, Sun Wenzhong, a suspect, was arrested by Chinese Detective Ding Huaguo and Detective Yin Zhanqing of the New Bureau Police Station and sent to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the detectives in charge of this case arrested Yao Guisheng, a native of Yangzhou, and his accomplice Xu Gengsheng, the principal offenders in the case, at No. 10, Lane 337, Xiaoshadu Road, and the Transit Company at No. 160, Zhapu Road, Hongkou. They were taken to the police station and sent to Criminal Court Two of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Attorney Wang Yaotang of the Police Station prosecuted them for gang robbery in accordance with Article 330 of the Criminal Law, requesting a postponement for a joint trial with the Sun Wenzhong case. Judge Chuan Lin briefly questioned Yao and Xu, ordered them to be detained, and rescheduled the joint trial for the morning of the 26th.</p>
<h3>Xu Wenzhao Once Summoned; Immediately Released on Bail</h3>
<p>Xu Wenzhao, the chairman of the Shanghai Hotel Association and the owner of the Hongfu Hotel on Wuhu Road, was summoned to the Criminal Division of the Police Department for interrogation on a certain issue at around 10:00 AM yesterday.

<h3>Fire Street Busts a Flower Society Listening Post</h3>
<p>The French Concession's Mailan Police Station (i.e., the Grand Auto-Clock Police Station) learned that a tailoring shop at No. 7, Lixian Lane, Dong Zilaihuo Street (accessed from Dongrenmei Lane) had a flower society listening post, which operated three times a day, morning, noon, and night, and each session could collect tens of thousands of yuan in bets, with huge wins and losses. Therefore, at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, a large number of Chinese and French detectives were dispatched to rush to the address and arrest the owner of the listening post (i.e., the tailoring shop owner, a Wuxi native, about 40 years old, nicknamed "Dwarf Fatty"), as well as two gamblers. Dozens of flower society slips and gambling funds were seized in the drawer. Then, the listening post owner was taken to No. 21, Zhizhong Lane, West Zilaihuo Street, where another flower society listening post was busted. The owner of the post was arrested, along with flower society slips and gambling funds, and all were taken back to the police station in a police car for investigation.</p>
<h3>Disputes Over Garbage Dumping; Puppet Side Uses the Excuse of Increased Population in the Concession; Demands an Annual Subsidy of 80,000 Legal Tender</h3>
<p>In the past two weeks, Zhu Zengji, a garbage contractor in the French Concession, has been negotiating with the puppet side in the central area of the city on the issue of subsidies for garbage dumping, but there has been no good result. Before the war, all the garbage in the French Concession was barged from the Bund outside Xinkaihe to various places in Punan or Xinlonghua for dumping, and the contractor subsidized the municipal authorities with 20,000 national currency annually for sanitation fees. Recently, the puppet side discovered that there was profit to be made, and immediately imposed duress, prohibiting the garbage from being transported to the above-mentioned places for dumping. The contractor had no choice but to negotiate, accompanied by Russian policeman Yang Gaosiji. It is reported that the puppet side used the excuse of a sharp increase in the population of the French Concession, demanding an annual subsidy of 80,000 legal tender before dumping could be allowed. Russian policeman Yang was turned away for his dissatisfactory remarks, resulting in no outcome. In recent days, the two districts of the Public Concession and the French Concession have been obstructed by the Japanese puppets, and all the ships of neighboring farmers coming to Shanghai to purchase night soil fertilizer have been banned, causing a brief wave of unrest. Fortunately, the night soil contractor managed to sell it at the night soil factory.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Fined in Shanghai; Probation for Two Years Due to First Offense</h3>
<p>Wu Xiquan (30 years old), a native of Yixing and the second landlord of No. 5, Lane 198, Route Paul Henry Vignon, forced his third tenant, Zhu Jingci, a native of Tongzhou, to move out on the 4th of this month, resulting in a verbal and physical altercation between the two sides. As a result, Zhu was injured. After the incident occurred, the French police received a report and ordered an investigation. The results showed that Wu had committed an act of bodily harm, so they filed a public prosecution against Wu in the Criminal Court Eight of the Second Special Court in accordance with the law. After Judge Qiu conducted the interrogation, a verdict was announced yesterday, stating that Wu Xiquan committed bodily harm and was fined 10 yuan. If he refuses to do labor service, one yuan will be calculated as one day. However, considering that he is a first-time offender, he is granted a two-year probation.</p>
<h3>Saving a Life Results in Death</h3>
<p>Yao Quandi, a local resident of No. 42, Yinjiacheng, South of Xujiahui, ran out of the house in anger the night before last because he was beaten by his father, Yao Fujian. Because it was dark, he accidentally fell into the river in front of the door. A tenant, Zhao Zhangsheng, 36 years old, a native of Zhao Family Residence, south of Huangjia Huayuan, Caohejing, and a clerk in the air-conditioning room of the Tongmao Foreign Company on Jing'an Temple Road, heard the news and rushed to rescue him. However, he was seriously cut in both feet by iron fragments in the river. He was rushed to Guangci Hospital for treatment that night, but he died in the hospital yesterday due to excessive bleeding.</p>

<p>Wang Pan, a Ningbo woman, 36 years old, residing at No. 82, Rue de Plaisance in the French Concession, committed suicide by swallowing raw opium at around 7:00 PM last night after arguing with her husband because her husband's gambling debts were very high, resulting in financial difficulties for the family. She was discovered and rushed to a hospital in western Shanghai for treatment.</p>
<h3>Adventurous Sailing Ship Meets the Coolidge Liner in the Pacific Ocean; Coolidge's Captain and Anderson Stop Ship to Reminisce; Crew and Passengers Exchange Gifts of Objects and Books; Taiping Encountered Hardship but Continues Adventurously</h3>
<p>The Continental Daily reports that the American mail steamer President Coolidge arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 19th) from Kobe, bringing news of its encounter at sea with the sailing ship Taiping, which had departed from Shanghai bound for San Francisco. Last Thursday, while en route from Honolulu to Yokohama, the Coolidge sighted a sailing ship flying the American flag in the distance. As it approached, they saw six people on board, one of whom was recognized by Captain Kolsmede of the President Coolidge. This person was Captain Anderson, who, in April, along with his Russian wife, four crewmen, and</p>
<p>a dog and a cat, had set sail from Shanghai in a 45-foot sailing ship bound for the Golden Gate Exposition and had encountered repeated misfortune. At the time, the Taiping was located at 34 degrees 43 minutes north latitude and 155 degrees 01 minute east longitude. A month earlier, Captain Kolsmede had met Anderson in Kobe and given him directions for his voyage, hence their acquaintance. When the President Coolidge was about 100 yards behind the Taiping, Captain Coolidge hailed loudly. Anderson heard him and waved in response. The Coolidge then stopped and gradually approached</p>
<p>the small sailing ship. At that time, the Taiping had been drifting in storms for seven days, with both food and water running low. The crew and passengers of the Coolidge enthusiastically gifted them with books, newspapers, candy, meat, flour, eggs, canned goods, and even frozen meat. They also filled the Taiping's seven water tanks with drinking water. According to Anderson, after the Taiping entered the sea, it had encountered two cargo ships passing nearby. The ship was not equipped with a radio and had drifted sixty miles off course. Captain Coolidge then redirected the ship,</p>
<p>heading east to avoid the storm and estimating that it would take 45 to 55 days to reach the United States, as Captain Anderson did not intend to sail to Honolulu or other islands. After docking alongside the Coolidge for an hour and a half, the Taiping set sail in a gentle breeze, with the passengers of the Coolidge cheering them on. The Taiping is equipped with a 14-horsepower auxiliary engine and carries enough fuel to operate day and night for twelve days, with a sailing rate of four and a half nautical miles per hour. Anderson and his wife originally set sail from Shanghai on April 7 with three Chinese and one Russian crew member.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese crew members all suffered from seasickness, and two of them died. Anderson then returned to Shanghai and hired two Norwegian sailors, for a total of six people, and set sail again on April 22. En route to Japan, one of the crew members fell ill but recovered. On April 28, the Taiping docked in Japan for repairs, but when leaving Kobe, the crew member's illness recurred, forcing him to return to Shanghai alone. Anderson then found a replacement in Kobe. When the Taiping encountered the President Coolidge at sea last week, it had already</p>
<p>been at sea for 29 days. Anderson has 31 years of sailing experience. This time, he is determined to sail to the United States and exhibit his sailing ship at the Golden Gate Exposition and the New York World's Fair. If he cannot reach the New York fair before it closes, Anderson also intends to sail to New York and then to the World Games held in Europe in 1940. Recent attempts to cross the Pacific before the Taiping include: (1) American Dr. Petersen's Hermel Hermel; (2) Mr. Nichols's Merlin, the boat was lost, but all on board were rescued; (3) Russian adventurer Zachinko's boat, which was lost, but all on board were rescued; (4) American Heileburg's Sea Dragon, which was also lost.</p>
<h3>Jiang Jianqiu's Romantic Theft Case; Female Performer Appears in Court for Confrontation; Hearing of Jiang Jianqiu Suddenly Prohibits Public Attendance; Defendant Retracts Confession and Denies Knowing This Woman; Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentencing Scheduled for the 27th</h3>
<p>Jiang Jianqiu, a romantic thief from Jiangxi, caused a sensation in society. He usually acted lavishly and repeatedly impersonated the owners of major stores, using fraudulent means to deceive women, defiling them and stealing their property. He was apprehended by the Public Concession police and brought to the First Special District Court for prosecution, where he was sentenced to five years in prison. Later, the police found that the suspect had committed similar crimes within the concession, so they sent detectives to bring Jiang back into custody and send him to the Second Special District Court for investigation and detention. During the court hearing, in addition to confessing to opening rooms with Zhou Jinxiang, the concubine of a wealthy family, Li Didi, Zhu Xiuxia, Xing Sannan, a prostitute from Han Zhuang, Liu Jindi, and female guides Chen Lingyang and Chen Lijun, and stealing ornaments, he also</p>
<p>implicated three female performers, Mao Jianqiu, Yu Guifen, and Yao Yuchan, claiming to have had relationships with them and given them property. The case was originally concluded by Judge Qiu Huanhan, pending sentencing. However, for the sake of thoroughness, it was deemed necessary to conduct a detailed investigation and cross-examination, so the closing arguments were revoked and a new trial was ordered. Summons were issued to the three female performers, Mao, Yu, and Yao, and all the victims to appear in court on time for questioning. These details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning marked</p>
<p>the date for the reopening of the trial. Since the case occurred, it has attracted considerable attention from the public, who all wanted to see the demeanor of the romantic thief and to catch a glimpse of the faces of Mao, Yu, and Yao. Therefore, before dawn, the court opened its doors, and those who came to observe filled the seats. Mao Jianqiu, accompanied by her father, Mao Yunke, arrived at the court and sat silently in the waiting room. Mao wore a blue cloth cheongsam, without any makeup, appearing very quiet. At 8:30 a.m., Judge Qiu began the trial in the eighth court, first ordering the hearing of other minor cases. At 10:30 a.m., he began the hearing of this case, ordering the defendant Jiang Jianqiu to be brought before the court. Jiang appeared composed, wearing a monk's collar short-sleeved striped shirt and pants, with a fierce face, high cheekbones, and a short stature. After providing his year of birth and place of origin, the prosecuting attorney from the police, Gu Shouxu, stated the case and charged him with crimes such as theft and fraud. Detective Sui Wenzhi, who handled the case, reported that, except for the female performer Yu Guifen, who had recently married and was on her honeymoon, and Yao Yuchan, who was currently in Nanjing and</p>
<p>could not be summoned, Mao Jianqiu, Chen Cuiyang, Chen Lijun, and Chen Wangshi had all complied with the summons and presented the stolen goods, including two women's spring coats, five long-haired tiger绒 women's coats, nine gold rings, and five watches. First, the victim Chen Wangshi testified that she lived at 27 Pi Shao Nai Road and that in March, while passing through Fa Da Road, the defendant stole a watch from her and requested its return. Next, Chen Cuiying and Chen Lijun testified that they were employees of the Yang Guifei Xiang Society and admitted to having opened rooms with Jiang and having been cheated out of their property. During the testimony,</p>
<p>their demeanor was light and cheerful, eliciting laughter, which was stopped by the bailiff. When questioned, Mao Jianqiu testified that she was 22 years old, from Xiangyang, Hubei, and worked as a performer. She also stated that according to the report, the defendant testified in court about having opened a room with Jianqiu on March 18, but she was sick and on leave on March 17 and entered the Sino-Western Sanatorium for treatment until February 21, when she returned to the stage. She also presented medical prescriptions and other evidence in court. At this point in the questioning, the court suddenly announced that the case involved public morals and prohibited public attendance. Upon hearing the announcement, the observers reluctantly left one after another. At that time, the weather turned unfavorable,</p>
<p>and a heavy rain poured down, soaking everyone. Afterward, it was heard that the defendant suddenly retracted his previous confession in court, claiming that he did not know this Mao Jianqiu and that the Mao Jianqiu he knew was taller than her (referring to the female performer) and was someone's concubine. Then, according to the female performer, she did not know Jiang, and she had never worn a diamond ring. After questioning, the court ruled that the case was clear and ordered closing arguments. The lawyer for the French Concession authorities, Gu Shouxi, argued that the defendant should be punished according to the three crimes of theft, fraud, and robbery. The defendant was then asked if he had any final statements, and the court ordered the closing arguments to be concluded, with sentencing scheduled for the 27th. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3>Publication of "International Financial Market" - Translated by Liu Kongjun -</h3>
<p>"International Financial Market" was originally written by John T. Madden and Marcus Nadier, professors at New York University in the United States, and published in 1935. It is based on field investigations and studies of the changes in the gold task and the reasons for its collapse after the major changes in the international financial market from 1931 to 1935, and describes the organization and operation of international financial centers. Therefore, the entire book starts with gold and the gold standard, and then discusses the international market, as well as the financial organization and operation of major international financial markets around the world, such as London, New York, and Paris, and the reaction of the post-war economy. The collapse of the gold standard in the past ten years has been traced back to its causes and effects. Translated into a book by Mr. Liu Kongjun, it is published by Zhengzhong Bookstore. Mr. Liu works in the banking industry. With his knowledge and experience, the translation of this book is clear and concise, so it avoids the dryness of financial books at the moment. At present, the world's finances cannot be considered stable, and China's finances are undergoing extreme changes. Reading this book should make people realize the origin of its cause and effect.</p>
<h3>Public Concession Police Authorities Strictly Search the Western Shanghai Area to Prevent Illegal Elements from Entering and Maintain Public Security in the Concession</h3>
<p>The Public Concession police authorities, in view of the rampant bandits and murders in the area beyond the Shanghai Western Concession's built roads, which have had a significant impact on social security and are related to public security, have ordered the Gordon Road and Putuo Road police stations to dispatch a large number of Chinese and foreign detectives to set off in groups and conduct strict searches of various vehicles, such as buses, trams, and rickshaws, on Caojiadu, Haig Road, Yuyuan Road, and Jessfield Road.

<h3>Silk and Satin Bureau Shareholders Collude with Employees to Embezzle Woolen Serge; Report Plane Bombing Cargo during Shipment from Songjiang to Shanghai; Major Shareholder Reports Arrest and Detention for Investigation</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhongchi of Songjiang invested 30,000 yuan with Chen Fangping, Chen Huanglong, Chen Jishi, Chen Qiyin, Zhang Chenshi, and others in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China to open the Yuanda Silk and Satin Bureau in Miaoyan Temple, Songjiang. Zhang invested 15,000 yuan, and the rest was invested by Chen Fangping and the other five. Over the years, due to effective management, the business flourished and there was an annual surplus. In the 26th year of the Republic of China,</p>
<p>after the outbreak of the Shanghai War, Japanese aircraft bombed Songjiang. Zhang Zhongchi was deeply afraid that the goods would be damaged, so he hired two gasoline boats to entrust Chen Fangping's employee Yang Shutang to transport woolen serge worth more than 60,000 yuan (currently worth about 100,000 yuan) to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, after Chen and Yang arrived in Shanghai, they suddenly reported to Zhang Zhongchi that the goods sent to Shanghai had been</p>
<p>bombed and completely destroyed by Japanese aircraft when passing through Zhujing. At the time, Zhang also thought that the facts were possible, so he did not doubt it. But recently, Zhang suddenly heard that the goods had not been bombed and were transported to Shanghai by Chen and Yang, who embezzled them and sold them one after another for personal gain. Therefore, he immediately began investigating and discovered that after Chen and Yang arrived in Shanghai, they opened a room at 31 Datong Hotel, 4 Lane 21, Hubei Road, and lived there. The hotel</p>
<p>accountant proved that when Chen and others came, they brought a large number of packages, all with the word "Yuanda" on them, which filled a room. After four days, they moved away, which further proved the fraudulent behavior of Chen and Yang. Therefore, on the 19th, he reported to the Laozha Police Station, and Chinese detective Guo Ruiquan investigated and confirmed the facts. That night, at 11:30 p.m., Chen Fangping and Yang Shutang were arrested at 67 Lane 613, Xiafei Road,</p>
<p>and sent to the First Criminal Court of the Special Court yesterday morning. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi explained the process, stating that the case still needed to be investigated in detail, so he requested that the two defendants be detained for further investigation. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, both defendants still insisted that the goods transported to Shanghai had indeed been bombed. The court then ordered the defendants to be returned to custody and rescheduled for questioning in a week.</p>
<h3>Haiwei Fast Ship Sails to Hong Kong Tomorrow</h3>
<p>The Haiwei fast ship, managed by Qia Cheng Shen Xing at 12 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, is scheduled to sail directly from Shanghai to Hong Kong tomorrow (the 22nd) evening. The ship travels quickly and is said to arrive in two to three days. The goods are stored at the Junyi Warehouse after arriving in Hong Kong, which is extremely reliable. If there are fresh goods, etc., and you want to pick up the goods at the side of the ship, customers can do so at their convenience. In order to ensure the safety of customers and goods, the company has hired Sun Guifang as the compradore to take care of the ship. In the future, if there are any missing goods, etc., the compradore will be responsible, and customers will not suffer any losses. Therefore, the ship's cargo transportation is very prosperous.</p>

<h3>Wide Bravery</h3>
<p>— Geng Zhi</p>
<p>On the streets of the city, I often see such comedies: the one with big fists and thick arms, grabs the skinny "chicken ribs" and beats them hard; a large group of people, even carrying guns and sticks, confront one or two people with no weapons; a young and strong lad beats an old man with gray hair and bloodies his head, or beats a "ugly duckling" with feathers still growing, making them cry; a man, a real man, slaps a woman to the ground and kicks her against the wall… I always applaud these heroes who have the upper hand and gain the advantage, and secretly praise them, saying: How brave, truly rare, and these heroes are indeed capable, often able to fulfill their desires, no matter how the opponent evades or begs for mercy, they will always thoroughly "punish" them, giving the bystanders a good time: Brave warrior! Brave warrior! How can the people live without brave warriors!</p>
<p>In other places, I have also seen another kind of warrior: cursing at people, standing in their own place, saying to the other party, "If you have the guts, come over here"; on the one hand, they roll up their sleeves, take off their shoes, and make all kinds of poses of preparing for battle, waiting for the other party to do the same, and then "I will not offend others unless others offend me", and then, after three rounds of drums, they do not see the clash of weapons, and then they withdraw their troops, thus preserving the great courage of "seeming weak", each with their own merits; in case the other party does not know what is good, does not understand this trick of mutually praising each other to become famous for bravery, and actually acts aggressively, jumping forward and wanting to get their way, our warriors, although using the best of the Thirty-Six Strategies, will still turn around and say, "If you have the guts, stand there and don't run, wait for me to go back and call my brother!" Thus, the high arrogance still surpasses the other party, and the name of bravery can be preserved forever!</p>
<p>It seems that the reason why bravery is bravery, with the above people, we can already see more than one aspect of it, and there is no need to ask more people, right? Therefore, the conditions for bravery that have been passed down throughout history can be seen to be all wrong. If you don't believe it, you can explain it as follows:</p>
<p>"Reflecting on oneself and shrinking", wanting to enter the "millions of people" with bare hands is just like an ant, trampled to death, why bother; "not scratching the skin" will have the pain of broken skin and bleeding, "not escaping the eyes" will have the danger of having your eyes poked out, isn't that wrong; if "the brave" is "not afraid", wouldn't they become an unfilial son, because "the body and hair are received from parents", they should "not dare to destroy them", wouldn't they be self-inflicted madmen, because "those who know fate do not stand under the rock wall"; the "great courage" of calming the world with anger is, after all, just talk, because anger is not originally "courage"; "Greeks meet Greeks", how can there be so many "Greeks" for you to "meet", and you must "meet your opponent" to play chess, which is naturally extremely stupid…</p>
<p>Therefore, the warriors that have been passed down throughout history are also deceiving people. If you don't believe it, please see: Jing Ke, who assassinated the King of Qin, had to hide the dagger in the picture, and Zhuan Zhu, who assassinated King Liao, had to hide the sword in the fish intestine, inevitably concealing and sneaking; "taking the head of the general from a million troops is like taking something out of a bag" "My brother Yide, although he flaunted his might on Changban Bridge for a while, the result was still "burning the bridge and retreating"; all the way to the "Baturu" of the Qing Dynasty, although it was a well-deserved "brave title", those who had this "brave" title were actually a few "old guns"; plus the Western Mr. Don Quixote, how heroic and self-satisfied, but he fought against "windmills", and compared to A Q, who claimed "the old man beats the son", wasn't he just as good at self-deprecation, giving people a bad impression…</p>
<p>The so-called natural and righteous bravery is only the various things I said at the beginning; the so-called true, non-negotiable warriors are only the several heroes I said at the beginning. To sum up, bravery is: the strong bullying the weak; the many abusing the few; the young and strong deceiving the old and weak; men bullying women… warriors are: robbers; thugs; hooligans; bums… From now on, our concepts of bravery and warriors must be completely changed. If I am not seeing too little and being surprised, then I am ignorant of the truth, and naturally the disaster of not recognizing Mount Tai with my eyes is even greater.</p>
<p>Confucius even scolded Zilu, who was fond of bravery, saying, "I will not associate with those who wrestle with tigers and cross rivers, and die without regret." Now, in the international community, it is also popular to annex the weak and break the old saying that "winning is not martial." My words are the bravery I am promoting, so what is wrong with it!</p>
<h3>Rapid Shoal</h3>
<p>— Xu Qing</p>
<p>The young people are singing again, the melody divided into two parts. Some have only sung to the end, while others have started again, cycling endlessly.</p>
<p>The helmsman, with his goatee, impatiently tapped the deck, then, as if showing off, said:</p>
<p>"Look, the rapid shoal is just ahead, you need to be quiet! Everyone crowded together, the bow won't be able to lift up in a bit!"</p>
<p>His words dampened the singing, bringing it to an end.</p>
<p>"Alright! Who doesn't know that!"</p>
<p>"You don't put in the effort yourself, and you blame others. If we don't get to the market tonight, we'll be hungry tomorrow morning!"</p>
<p>This complaint stirred resentment in the pole-pusher at the bow:</p>
<p>"It's truly unjust! Everything has its time! Just because you haven't studied, do you think you can become an official?"</p>
<p>"You guys--" The youngest one stopped before he could finish speaking. Then everyone fixed their eyes on what lay ahead.</p>
<p>A surge of panting like the sound of pine trees shattered the sudden silence. The river spread into a rapid current two hundred yards wide, with the feet of two mountains stretching straight into the river. A line of reefs further blocked the current, causing the waves to roar madly.</p>
<p>The flat-bottomed boat moved upstream along the edge of the rapids, the sound of the water transforming from panting to thunder.</p>
<p>"Ah yo, ai ya!" A mournful cry trembled, a sturdy waist braced against a pole, the bow of the boat suddenly lifted toward the rapids, and then the entire vessel plunged into the roaring current.</p>
<p>On the shore: The trackers, backs arched like two herons, stepped on a rock, trod through a thicket of thorns, the fierce sun scorching their dark purple backs and shoulders, the tow rope constantly whistling.</p>
<p>"Ah yo, ai ya!" This time, the deep, solid shoulders lunged forward, the pole bending into a semicircle.</p>
<p>"Ah yo, ai ya!" The long chorus from the shore lightened the burden, as if in a trance.</p>
<p>"Everyone lean to the sides! We're almost through the rapids!" The helmsman's voice was hoarse.</p>
<p>The rapid shoal was passed, the river again weaving a light, blue dream.</p>
<p>The pole-pusher put down his pole, collapsing with exhaustion, and took up his bamboo pipe to smoke languidly. The helmsman stroked his beard, silently. The trackers waded through the water, heedless of their wet feet as they strode onto the boat. The young passengers broke the silence once more.</p>
<p>"Hey! Boatman! Say 'Get up!' alright? Ah yo, ai ya! Who hurt you?"</p>
<p>"Alright! Whatever you say!" A smoke ring puffed from the big mouth.</p>
<p>"Shen Chun'gen! Can you sing?"</p>
<p>The loyal tracker nodded.</p>
<p>Thus, the passionate singing rose again, refined and crude blending together.</p>
<p>The river was clear and smooth, and a newly brimming song flowed from the boatmen's mouths:</p>
<p>"...Forward! Advance!"</p>
<p>"Get up!..."</p>
<p>Cycling, cycling.</p>
<h3>Graduation, Then to the Front!</h3>
<p>— Written by Wu Yun</p>
<h3>Joy (3)</h3>
<p>True and great joy comes from communion between God and man. When it is said that man has communion with God, at first hearing, it sounds illusory, but it is actually very real. Why? Because man's communion with God is due to man's faith. It does not require knowledge, learning, material things, diligence, or seeking. It only requires faith, true and unfeigned. God immediately communes with man. This is the closest and most real thing, not empty talk. Some people say: "I believe in the existence of God, and I believe that God is the only true God. I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, and (perhaps) I also believe that Jesus is the Word made flesh (even less certain). Why do I have no joy?" I say that even demons believe. Your faith is on the same level as the demons' faith. The true God has no relationship with you. Even if there is a relationship, it is only God's wrath that is constantly upon you. You only have worry and fear; how can you have joy? If you take such belief as faith, it is simply self-deception. At best, the result of self-deception is merely to anesthetize yourself. Anesthesia is temporary, not permanent. The joy, if any, is fleeting, coming and going suddenly. This kind of joy is neither true nor great. The true and great joy I am talking about comes from faith. Faith communes with God. The true meaning of faith is trust; trust is obedience. If you have faith but do not obey, that is the faith of demons. What is obedience? It is doing what God says, word for word, step by step. Where is God's word? In the Bible. Do you believe that the Bible is the word of God? Do you truly wish to obey God's word without deceiving yourself or others? Then I can guarantee that you will receive joy from heaven.

<h3>Red Devil Vasika</h3>
<p>— Written by Gorky, Translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>"Marriage...is that possible? I haven't been to church in three years...this is terrible! Oh, you've found a good wife! Do you think I'll bear you children?"</p>
<p>The thought of children made him laugh inside. Vasika looked at her face and said nothing more...</p>
<p>"Ah, where are you taking me? Look...it's all the same. You're taking me somewhere to kill me, right? Aren't you a famous weirdo?"</p>
<p>"Shut up!" Vasika said softly.</p>
<p>But as she recalled everything that had happened in the past, she began to enumerate his cruelties.</p>
<p>"Please be quiet!" he begged her, but she ignored him, so he croaked:</p>
<p>"I told you to stop talking!"</p>
<p>That night they didn't say another word. In the night, Vasika talked in his sleep, guttural sounds and groans coming from his broad chest. He bit his teeth and patted his chest from time to time, waving his right hand back and forth in the air.</p>
<p>Ajiusniya woke up and stood by his bed, watching his face in terror for a long time. Finally, she woke him up:</p>
<p>"What's wrong with you? Is the devil tattooing your neck?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I had a dream!..." Vasika said weakly, "Give me some water."</p>
<p>After drinking the water, he shook his head and said:</p>
<p>"No, no, I won't open a den,...I should just do business,...a den is useless..."</p>
<p>"Do business..." she said as she thought, "Yes, opening a store, that's good!"</p>
<p>"Together, okay?" Vasika asked softly, as if trying to convince her.</p>
<p>"Are you telling the truth?" Ajiusniya cried, taking a few steps back from his bed.</p>
<p>"Ajiusniya, Seminovna!" Vasika raised his head from the pillow and said in a trembling voice.</p>
<p>"Then, you..." (Thirteen)</p>

<h3>Li Guangzhao's Falsified Timber Price Case</h3>
<p>The Emperor wanted to build the Yuanmingyuan and needed to procure a large amount of timber. The former Minister of the Internal Affairs Department, Cheng Ming, the former acting Director of the Internal Affairs Department, Gui Bao, and the Internal Affairs Department candidate Secretary, Cheng Lin, knew a timber merchant in Beijing named Li Guangzhao, and immediately brought him to see the officials. According to Li, if they went to Sichuan and other provinces to fell trees in the mountains, with a labor cost of 3,000 taels of silver, they could claim a value of 50,000 taels of silver. Thus, they ordered him to go and fell the trees, and he went to Beijing with Cheng Lin of the three men. Later, when he arrived in Hubei, he learned that felling trees in the mountains would take three years to leave the mountains, and the labor cost was too high. He went to Guangdong and Hong Kong to buy foreign timber. At that time, the French merchant Bovieley had timber for sale. Li hesitated at first because he had no money, but Cheng Lin wanted to use this to fill a vacancy, and said that he could borrow from his relatives, so they immediately decided to buy. Cheng Lin first took a sample of the timber back to Beijing, and Li went to Fuzhou to negotiate with Bovieley, agreeing to buy three ships of timber, totaling 35,000 foreign feet, at a price of one yuan and five jiao five fen per foot, totaling 54,250 silver yuan. They signed a contract, stating that the timber would be delivered and paid for in Beijing. If there was any delay, the daily ship price would be increased by 50 silver yuan. Li arrived in Tianjin in May, and Bovieley smuggled the first ship of timber. Li immediately went to Beijing to report the number of timber in the Internal Affairs Department, falsely reporting more than 55,500 foreign feet, worth more than 300,000 taels of silver. Because Cheng Lin had nowhere to borrow, and lacked funds to pay, the delivered timber was also unsuitable. He and the foreign merchant accused each other. It was found that he had carved the title of "Li, Imperial Envoy for Mining and Transporting Timber for the Yuanmingyuan" and made items such as "Imperial Decree for Purchasing" flags. A copy of the foreign language contract was also found. After translation, it contained the words "Li, Supervisor of the Yuanmingyuan, on behalf of the Emperor of the Great Qing, signed with so-and-so." According to Li, there was no such sentence in Chinese, and the foreign language was a mistranslation. However, the Chinese contract is now missing. After investigation by the Directing Governor Li Hongzhang, it was confirmed that he had falsely reported the timber price and was fraudulent and illegal. He also impersonated the supervisor of the Yuanmingyuan and cheated everywhere. He intends to submit a memorial requesting the death penalty with reprieve.</p>

<h3>Squeezing and Exchanging</h3>
<p>— Luo Lin</p>
<p>"The use of North China currency is banned!" Tens of thousands jostle at the bank doors.</p>
<p>On the sixteenth, a "rumor" suddenly arose in the market that Shanghai would stop using currency with North China place names. However, a "rumor" is, after all, a "rumor." Didn't it also spread widely last year, and later it was still usable? So everyone didn't quite believe it. On the seventeenth, the "rumor" grew larger and larger, and everyone began to panic. On the afternoon of the seventeenth, all banks uniformly refused to accept it, and the "rumor became a fact." There was considerable panic and confusion in the market. The morning newspaper on the eighteenth also published it openly, and the whole city immediately erupted in commotion. Everyone immediately busied themselves checking their legal currency, picking out the North China notes. Fortunately, the banks were still willing to exchange them, otherwise, wouldn't we be ruined?</p>
<p>The banks that issued North China currency included the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Farmers Bank of China, the China Merchants Bank, the China Industrial Bank, the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, the China Land Reclamation Bank, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Four Banks, the Hebei Provincial Bank, and the Dazhong Bank.</p>
<p>Exchange Locations</p>
<p>The Bank of China is on Avenue Joffre; the Bank of Communications is at Jing'an Temple; the China Merchants Bank is on the Bund; the China Land Reclamation Bank is on Sanma Road; the Four Banks are on Sichuan Road... no need to list them all one by one, they are all handled in their head offices.</p>
<p>Pilgrimage to Various Banks</p>
<p>Next to the Bank of China on Avenue Joffre, there is a long alley. People exchanging money lined up in a snake-like queue, four or five zhang long each queue, with four or five queues in succession. Strict order must be maintained, with no rushing or pushing. A large number of bank staff maintained the "queues." At first, the Bank of China only had one window handling the exchange. No matter how fast the clerks were, for every one that left, two came. It was really too late. The scene of everyone scrambling to exchange for legal currency when it was first implemented was still vividly before my eyes. Around half past eleven, there were still several hundred people. Seeing that this was really not right, they added another window, increasing the number of staff at each window. It was still too late!</p>
<p>The Bank of Communications at Jing'an Temple had no alley to line up in. Everyone crowded at the entrance, fighting and grabbing, and the order was quite bad (queues were also formed in the afternoon). There were also quite a few people at the Farmers Bank of China and the Bank of Agriculture. Other commercial banks, such as the China Merchants Bank and the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, originally issued fewer notes, and there was not much in circulation outside, so there was no such crowding.</p>
<p>Numerical Limits</p>
<p>Each bank only exchanged its own issued banknotes, and the amount was also limited. The Bank of China stipulates a maximum of one hundred yuan per person. Therefore, some people with a large amount kept coming again and again, anyway, the clerks were busy and didn't recognize you. Banknotes were insufficient, and wooden boxes of banknotes were transported in by trucks.</p>
<p>Other banks also had limits, varying from fifty to one hundred yuan. None of the large ones exceeded one hundred yuan. The banknotes paid out were all one-yuan notes, as there was a contraction in the circulation of large denomination legal currency.</p>
<p>Temporary Business</p>
<p>Where there is food, there is an unconstrained imagination, and no opportunity is missed. A group of people had teamed up to do this once-in-a-millennium good business. They crowded in front in groups of three or four, and could exchange money for you, charging between three and five fen per yuan. Those who didn't want to crowd were happy to save effort. But you had to be careful. If you blinked, and didn't watch them closely, both the people and the legal currency would fly away. Go negotiate with the ghosts! Brothers of the "three hands" were displaying their supernatural powers, and wallets disappearing from pockets were everywhere. You had to be careful.</p>

<h3>Beware of Counterfeit Stamps</h3>
<p>— Tang Kemin</p>
<p>Because of the shortage of fractional currency, stamps have become the only substitute in the market. Everyone is consistently using them, still maintaining the overall market, preventing the villains from realizing their conspiracy to cause trouble. Who knew they would rack their brains and calculate on stamps. Recently, I used a five-cent counterfeit stamp, because its color was about the same as the real one, and the amount was small. Inadvertently, it slipped into my pocket. Later, when I got home and looked at it, I determined that it was fake. Five-cent stamps are green. The fake one is a deeper color than the real one. The portrait of Mr. Sun Yat-sen on the stamp face is larger. There are more patterns in the two pillars on the sides. The paper is thinner than the real one, the printing is poor, and the glue on the back has no stickiness. With the above many flaws, it is undoubtedly fake. From this, we can see a glimpse of the villains' intentions. These small denomination stamps circulate on the market, and people mostly don't pay attention. The most pitiful are the general peddlers. They earn very little from transactions of one or two cents. If they use a few fake ones, wouldn't they be working for nothing for a day? Readers, please beware of these counterfeit stamps, and at the same time, I hope the authorities will pay attention.</p>
<h3>Watermelon Supplement</h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>The article "This Year's Watermelons" published on the 19th was drafted and sent by the author before the first typhoon occurred. However, after a typhoon, an abnormal change occurred in both the melon fields and the melon market. I should add a supplement, lest readers consider it inaccurate.</p>
<p>First of all, after a rainstorm, the melon vines in the melon fields were blown off by the wind, and a year of harvest suddenly became a year of famine. Although the early-ripening melons had already been sold for money, the late-ripening melons were greatly discounted, and the second-crop melons were even worse. Therefore, the farmers who grow watermelons are all wearing mourning faces. We only need to see that the watermelon boats have not arrived at the Old Zha Bridge these days to know that the watermelons have been hit by the wind and rain. In a few days, when it clears up, the weather will be hot and there will be less wind, and it is inevitable that the price of watermelons will be unusually high.</p>
<p>At the same time, watermelon vendors are also complaining about the weather and blaming others, shouting that they are unlucky. The windy and rainy, Lesser Heat weather is so cool that no one is asking about the watermelons they brought in. Moreover, the watermelons brought in a few days ago were very expensive. If they want to sell them these days, they have to reduce the price. They are unwilling to lose money, and they want to put them at home and wait for the weather to get hot before selling them at a good price. Watermelons are not like other things, they will rot if they are left for too many days, and the weather is always not hot, as if deliberately fighting against the watermelon vendors.</p>
<p>In short, two typhoons have overturned the entire watermelon market.</p>
<h3>Biographies of Female Storytellers</h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>During that time, both Zhu Youxiang and Shi Yuelan received poems from the literary guests of Bangjiang. The poem praising Youxiang says: "Innocent and naive Zhu Youxiang, the pipa and small clapper make melodious sounds. She is also娇憨and truly reliable, It is good that she is restrained by her mother's side." The poem praising Yuelan says: "Elegant and dignified Yueran, The demeanor of a great lady sits in the book hall. A song of陽春causes everyone to listen attentively, Do not regard her as an ordinary example." Both can be used as supplementary explanations. In addition, the "Shanghai Bamboo Branch Songs" praise female storytellers, in addition to Yuan Yunxian, Yan Lizhen, Chen Yue'e, Zhu Sulan, Xu Yayun, and Xu Shiyu, and also mentions the following four:</p>
<p>Wang Lijuan - Heaven has repeatedly sent a fairy to掌书, Wang Lijuan should be the leader. A kind of elegant and high style, Why must we let Cheng Lian move emotions?</p>
<p>Wang Youjuan - Youjuan is extremely intelligent, Her light smile and frown are even more pitiful. Her weak constitution cannot withstand being too thin, Do not let her stand in the wind, so fair.</p>
<p>Qian Yaqing - She assists in pouring wine while 按拍at the banquet, The oriole's voice echoes around the painted beams. Yaqing is especially good at singing refined songs, The pipa accidentally touches and attracts Zhou Lang.</p>
<p>Chen Aiqing - When she casually plays the sandalwood zither, she has emotions, The strange sound emits a heartbreaking sound. Why does someone especially like to sing the songs of Ba, Do you know there is an Aiqing in the bookstore?</p>
<p>As for the fair Gong's "Ding Chou Shanghai Bookstore Fairy Beauty List," it mentions twenty-eight people. The ones that also appear in the works of Shiping Sou and Bangjiang literary guests are Zhu Zilan, Chen Yue'e, and Chen Zhixiang. The twenty-five who have not been seen before. This is also an indispensable historical material for the study of female storytellers. The original text of Gong's publication was published in "Shen Bao," and it is strongly suspected that it is Wang Tao's so-called "Washer of Ears on the Wu Song River."

<h3>Spring Shen Bamboo Branch Words</h3>
<p>— Xiang Lan</p>
<p>Spring Shen is good, a refuge like a paradise, Singing and dancing is still peaceful, while The flames of war spread across the mountains and rivers, Ignoring the sound of battles.</p>
<p>Spring Shen is good, Making a fortune from the national crisis, Foreign exchange is privately operated by three hands, Hoarding grain does not save thousands of disasters, and The profiteer smiles.</p>
<p>Spring Shen is good, The gambling den is like a demon palace, The traffic is busy day and night, Calling "Lu" and drinking "Zhi" compete for dominance, and A single throw is an instant of ruin.</p>
<p>Since the national army retreated to the west, On the Spring Shen River, ladies are like clouds, But they only seek safety for the moment, and There are many who ignore the sound of artillery fire. Recently, prices have soared, manipulated by unscrupulous merchants, and The foreign exchange black market is actually self-operated by the silver industry. It is a pity that those who make money from the national crisis go in and out recklessly, and all are sent to the demon palace. It is rumored that those who are keen on gambling are generous and spend hundreds of gold without stinginess. In the bustling summer heat, I compose a vulgar poem to express my feelings.</p>

<h3>Silver Dream (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Xin Shi</p>
<p>—Narrated by Silver Star Miss Li Hong—</p>
<p>Editor's Introduction: Li Hong, a Cantonese, is now eighteen years old. Because she has lived in the North for a long time, she speaks fluent Mandarin. She entered the silver screen in her early years and became famous for her starring role in "First Love." Although she has only acted in four films, including "Tears of Love," "Demon of Desire," and "Lin Chong," she has already gained an excellent reputation and her artistic career is progressing rapidly. She has already achieved a very superior position in the film industry.</p>
<p>Three years ago, I often had silvery daydreams. Besides studying at school, I was single-mindedly looking forward to trying the flavor of the silver screen. It's really funny, I was indeed a standard movie fan.</p>
<p>Under a suitable opportunity, I really realized my dream and started working in the silver screen. Now, this life is like a dream, and two years have already passed. However, what kind of flavor is it exactly?</p>
<p>Starting at the Beginning</p>
<p>In 1936, I was lecturing at Jinling University in Nanjing, and I was a sophomore in the Physics and Chemistry Department. At that time, the state-run Central Film Studio was recruiting actors to prepare for the filming of "Secret Code." I went to take the exam in order to realize my dream. Although "ambition came to fruition" due to the obstacle of my height not being very suitable for the tall male lead Gao Zhanfei, after being admitted, I still didn't go to the set to film.</p>
<p>Trying Acting in Plays</p>
<p>Several colleagues in "Zhongdian" initiated the organization of the "China Drama Society" to perform plays. Because I had no films to shoot at the time, I was happy to join, hoping to gain some experience. The first play was "Thunderstorm," and I was responsible for the role of Sifeng. This role cannot rest from beginning to end, and the performance is extremely demanding. My physique was not very good, and at that time, I was still suffering from an uncured illness. My companions were very worried, thinking that I could at most muddle through two shows, and there was no possibility of lasting. Who knew that "Thunderstorm" was performed for a month, and I became more and more excited as I performed, and my illness was completely gone. Many people joked with me about this. "You were born to do this business." It's true, I decided to become such a laborer from then on.</p>
<p>First Taste of the Flavor</p>
<p>While "Thunderstorm" was being staged again. An official from Yihua Company happened to be watching the play and appreciated my performance, saying that I was quite suitable for filming. Therefore, through an introduction, a deal was reached. After "Thunderstorm" finished its one-month run, I hurried to Shanghai and entered the silver circle. At that time, "First Love" was being filmed. At first, I thought it wouldn't be too difficult. Unexpectedly, the first taste of the flavor was beyond my expectations. The more anxious I was, the more difficult it was to act well. There were really too many NG shots. The most interesting and inexplicable thing was a performance of sleeping in bed with my eyes closed. No matter how I filmed it, I couldn't get it right. I don't know if it was because the lights were too strong, but the more I wanted to close my eyes, the more they opened. Up to now, similar performances still cannot close my eyes, and I can only find a way to avoid them, or reshoot the back view. This is really incomprehensible and extremely strange.</p>

<h3>My View on Chaozhou Opera</h3>
<p>— Shizhen</p>
<p>Normally, Chaozhou opera is not performed in Shanghai. It only comes for a limited engagement every three or four years, so it attracts many Chaozhou opera enthusiasts. Its ticket prices are not lower than those of ordinary Peking opera (Chaozhou opera tickets are generally around one yuan), but how much do Chaozhou people long for the opera of their hometown!</p>
<p>This time, the troupe is "Old San Zheng Shun Xiang," which is very famous in Chaozhou. They came once three or four years ago, and the popularity of their performances broke the record for Chaozhou opera performances that year. However, this time it is indeed not as good as the last time. The performers in the troupe are not as complete as last time. The voices, acting, and appearance are all worse. The most regrettable thing is that Cai Yongsheng, the genuine young male lead from before, used to win praise every time he performed. His voice was clear and graceful, and his demeanor was elegant and unrestrained. Since returning home, his voice has deteriorated, and now he has been reduced to a supporting role. What a pity! The current leading female role, Qin Wen, has a high voice, but her acting is stiff and not as good as Weng Binglin (another female role). Other noteworthy performers include Ke Jinxiang, Lin Runqiu, and Huang Wucheng.</p>
<p>Although some of the plots are in line with the times, most of them are obscene and very illogical. This is the biggest shortcoming of Chaozhou opera. Finally, I would like to say to "Old San Zheng Shun Xiang," strive to select plays with national significance and in line with the times. (End)</p>
<h3>Random Musings by the Fence (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Yu Tang</p>
<p>I initially thought that the Golden Theater was small and acoustically good, so singing with Ju Peng's resonant voice would be sure to sound great. But after listening several times in a row, I couldn't help but feel disappointed. Sometimes, I had to concentrate fully to hear even a single word. The reason is still Ju Peng's deliberate pursuit of perfection. He painstakingly projects each word from the back of his throat, but also focuses all his attention on "playing" those delicate little tunes. He doesn't have enough breath, so neither the words nor the tunes can reach far. In addition, the accompanying erhu's tone is very weak. The more it tries to follow and match, the more clumsy and cumbersome it seems, making the listener restless. Just think, besides the words and tunes, what else is left in Ju Peng's performance? As for his appearance and movements, apart from a few people who are fascinated by his antiquarian charm, that expressionless face, like a puppet, causes laughter in every scene. One thing I want to defend him for is that no one can hear Ju Peng's good singing, but the few applause he gets are precisely for his most unbearable poor melodies.</p>
<p>Cao Cao's Empty City, Running the Slope, and Hong Yang Cave are all Ju Peng's masterpieces, and also plays that I am familiar with. The models of the predecessors have been admired for a long time, and I dare not criticize them in the slightest. I admire his attention to detail and authenticity, but I have always believed that his excessive focus on cleverness is a bad transformation. Ju Peng may think that he can increase his "immediate" reputation by doing so, but on the contrary, this will affect his future status. The Golden Theater's continuous full houses are the result of people's fascination with Ju Peng's early excellent records, not to "see" Ju Peng on stage today. Many people like to follow trends and admire chrysanthemums by the eastern fence, but they may not all be able to appreciate the beauty of the chrysanthemum.</p>
<p>Mr. Su Shaoqing felt refreshed after listening to Ju Peng's "thief" in Empty City and "leisure" in Hong Yang Cave, thinking that even if the whole play was terrible, these two words alone would be enough to enjoy. This is a kind of humor and also an artist's prejudice, not enough to talk to ordinary people. Finally, he said that he had a thousand words to say to vent his feelings, and I am eager to read this great article, which will surely scratch many itches. Ju Peng has a very rich knowledge of old plays. He told me that he planned to write something for fellow enthusiasts to pass on to future generations. For eight years, he has been too lazy, and I guess he hasn't written a single word. Mr. Su is said to have his "incendiary pen" about to burst, and I hope he doesn't also become lazy and have a miscarriage. Because his article will definitely give Ju Peng's art a definite evaluation.</p>
<h3>Iron Voice, Steel Throat: Talking about Yue Di</h3>
<p>— Liu Zhengzhu</p>
<p>Who doesn't know Qiu Yue Di when you mention her? She is the younger sister of the famous female performer Meng Xiaodong and the niece of the renowned teacher Qiu Yuexiang. Not only does she have a family tradition of learning, but she also has a gifted voice. One song from her can amaze everyone. Among the female performers of late, she can truly be called outstanding. She currently belongs to the Era Theater and is already recognized and praised. In the past, the little girl inevitably had a bit of a pretentious air because she was not deeply involved in the world. Now, she has completely changed her attitude. Whether it is treating people or handling affairs, she is always polite and courteous. Therefore, there are also many people who support her. It can be seen that when performing opera, the content must be genuine, and personal relationships must also be paid attention to. Last Saturday night, she performed "Ascending to Heaven" and the complete "Catching Cao, Releasing Cao" (from the court to the inn). Performing two such difficult and tiring plays at the same time is not easy to find among female performers today. Therefore, when "Ascending to Heaven" first appeared on stage, everyone applauded spontaneously. Yue Di was also particularly energetic that night. Her singing was full of ups and downs, and every note resonated in the clouds. The flavor was mellow and rich. The rapid triple beat, in three-three time, at three o'clock and three minutes, was accomplished in one breath, like a waterfall hanging from a cliff, rushing down thousands of miles, without showing any signs of exhaustion or hoarseness. It was truly commendable. In "Catching Cao, Releasing Cao," her slow singing when listening to his words and her original singing in the inn were sweet and clear, like pearls rolling on a jade plate. The whole play was full of wonderful melodies, which were enough to evoke deep emotions and dispel all worries. The audience applauded every sentence, so calling her an "iron voice, steel throat" is not an exaggeration. Her acting is also free and easy to watch. It is a pity that her pronunciation is still not strong enough, and her dialogue has a slightly feminine tone, which is a bit of a flaw. However, flaws do not obscure the jade, and we should not be too critical. Given time, she will surely reach perfection. In short, Yue Di is a newly discovered piece of beautiful jade. Cutting and polishing still needs a good craftsman, and diligent study and research are promising for Yue Di. Yue Di, please strive for it.</p>

<p>(10) Shanghai Opera</p>
<p>Shanghai opera used to be an art form appreciated only by some native Shanghainese, but in recent years, it has "no distinction between north and south." The ladies and gentlemen living in Shanghai all love to run to Shanghai opera theaters. The reason is simply that it is easy to understand and popular.</p>
<p>Some short comedies that make jokes, like "Comparing Begonias," which depict the innocent feelings of young children, are very thought-provoking.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Because of Ju Peng's popularity, I think of Guan Dayuan's decline.</p>
<p>In recent years, the performers who have been singing repeatedly are none other than Ma Lianliang, Tan Fuying, Yang Shisen, and the junior Ma Lianliang Li Shengzao, the junior Li Shengzao Sha Shixin... Everyone knows that Shanghainese have an old problem of loving novelty. As the saying goes, "A new toilet will be fragrant for three days." It's no wonder everyone feels that the above-mentioned people are too poor and not rare enough. Ju Peng has not come to Shanghai for ten years. In terms of his qualifications and seniority, he can be considered the oldest ancestor of learning Tan among the above-mentioned people. Moreover, his prices are lower than Ma and Tan's. At the same time, he also brought a newly emerging Hou Yulan, an old beardsman who has become new, and a brand new female performer. As a result, the Shanghainese went wild. In addition, the Golden Theater's publicity was effective. Every day, the newspapers published words such as "half a month reservation," so the audience became more and more crowded. According to many people, Ju Peng has been getting "stage laughs" almost every day since he took the stage, when singing, acting, and swinging his headdress. Even in "Er Jin Gong," he actually got a full house of stage laughs (stage laughs are a kind of tolerant ridicule, different from booing and heckling). The ending of that sentence should have gone up, but because Ju Peng was weak, he had a bit of a yellow accent, as if the spring of a record player had loosened, so he got a big stage laugh. However, it was instantly silent, which proves that the audience was very tolerant of his decline. Everyone felt compassion and love for him, and couldn't bear to make him too embarrassed. Therefore, Ju Peng's popularity this time (in terms of box office) is actually due to the words "old brand."</p>
<p>When it comes to the existing Tan school beardsmen who can sell the old brand, even Shu Yan and Xiao Pei, including them, can't sell as well as Guan Shengyi's eldest son, Guan Dayuan. When Lao Tan and Liu Hongsheng had not yet retired from the opera stage in the early years of the Republic of China, Dayuan was already famous. Although he is eight or nine years younger than Xiaochen, the timing of their fame is about the same. Therefore, thirty years ago, "Old Scheme Gains Advantage" and "Baida Company" had recorded their "Crying Spirit Tablet" and "Pan Guan" and other records. From this, it can be proved that if he had not been famous very early, he would never have been asked by the record company to record. As for his experience of learning art since childhood, I will describe it briefly as follows. — (64) —</p>
<h3>Introducing "The Three Musketeers"</h3>
<p>The New China Company's annual production of the slapstick comedy "The Three Musketeers" is scheduled to be screened at the Jincheng Theater this Saturday. It stars the three treasures Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, and Liu Jiqun, who play chivalrous musketeers who eradicate evil and support the good, with loyalty shining in their hearts. The plot is full of twists and turns, and the performance is hilariously突梯, making people laugh until their stomachs hurt. Imitating Liu, Guan, and Zhang in the bamboo forest, they wear opera costumes and swear brotherhood. The three of them drive a broken-down Austin around the world. Yellow cattle pull the car, patrolling the downtown area. The musketeers turn into ghosts and fall into the beauty trap. The three treasures perform all kinds of anecdotes vividly, not at all inferior to the Western Laurel and Hardy and other comedy stars. The film is directed by Chen Yiqing and took seven months to produce. There are also dozens of stars, such as Zhang Zhizhi, assisting in the performance. Its value is certainly not comparable to ordinary crudely made slapstick comedies.</p>
<p>Due to space limitations today, "Chess Garden" will be suspended for one day. (Editor)</p>
