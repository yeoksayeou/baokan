<p>社評</p>
<h3>國際聯盟會將如何作爲</h3>
<p>國際聯盟會今日在瑞士國日內瓦城舉行會員國全體大會，以芬蘭政府所提關於蘇聯侵略芬蘭之申訴爲主要議案。據昨日倫敦方面之預測，國聯大會對本案殆將決定下列四點：一，譴責蘇聯之侵略；二，請各國勿予蘇聯以何種援助；三，請各國儘量援助芬蘭；四，請蘇聯停止侵略。此項預測，雖不應遽視爲必然，然消息所透露，固無異昭告世人日，四點而外，母更奢望也。關於芬蘭蘇聯問題，吾人既屢述觀感，茲不欲復事議論；關於國際聯盟，則請於此大會時期，或爲各方猶加注意之際，略陳所懷。</p>
<p>國際聯盟會組織於第一次世界大戰之後，望重一時；而其盟約所示，尤得維繫國際秩序，奠定世界和平。及一九三一年，經日本侵略中國問題之試驗，弱點畢露；暴者恣爲背盟之行動，强者怠於護法之義務，於是國聯奄奄一息，僅保其形骸而已。雖於衛生合作技術諸端，亦嘗有其相當貢獻，顧非組織國聯本旨；甚可以此證明國聯之存在，詎足以此說明國聯之價値。溯念國聯自始迄今之經歷，悔恨，歎息，詛咒，嘲諷之者，各有其人焉，擁護，玩弄，蔑視，破壞之者，又各有其人焉；夫以會員組織之集團，會員對此集團態度之不齊若此，則終於頽廢崩潰，非意外也。</p>
<p>往者，吾人對於國聯，始而期望之至切，繼而失望之彌甚；今者，吾人雖不復作何奢望，然猶殷願世人勿因噎廢食，視爲絕望而敝屣之。誠以人類羣居以爲生，自配偶而家庭而部落而邦而國，自然演進，莫能自外；更自國而聯，固猶自然趨歸；橫逆波折，在所不免，然自然法則實有至充分之理由，至偉大之力量，終底於完成，決不因橫逆波折而弛廢。若國聯者，基礎有其不健全之伏因，組織有其不合理之缺陷，盟的有其不切實之規定，甚至主持其事之國家亦有不忠誠之重大嫌疑；而其二十年之歷史，不但未能善用時間，使不健全者漸趨健全，不合理者漸趨合理，不切實者漸趨切實，以赴國聯應有之使命，抑且以虛事委蛇而事實上乃在步步倒退之中。夫誰實尸其咎哉？謂英法因循顢頇，誠然；謂日德桀驁乖戾，誠然；謂美國置身事外，誠然；然人羣最高機構之失敗，與其歸咎誰何，甯若斷言於人羣實未爲此最高機構竭其全力，盡其至善。以破壞國際秩序，破壞世界和平者之處心積慮，蓄暴力，肆暴行；此在愛好和平，崇尙秩序者，除以腦汁墨汁演爲國聯盟約若干條若干款，各繳會費若干金若干銀而外，何嘗爲國聯行爲者培養絲毫行爲力量？以絕無力量者制暴力，以不能行爲者制暴行；其必顚躓，其必崩潰，豈待顚躓崩潰而後知之。往日中國申訴而一再憊賴如彼，今日芬蘭申訴而所傳決議如此，是在絕無行爲力量之國聯，亦可謂恰如其分耳。</p>
<p>國聯旣無行爲力量，、世人固何取於國聯？今日何爲依然殷願世人勿敝屣國關？當中國之申訴國聯焉，在中國本意，並非依賴國聯，但以爲國聯應就所能範圍，有所切實表見。事實所示，表見至惡劣；蓋中日問題之是非曲直，自始昭然，而國聯猶以調查爲遷延其判斷之方法；終於譴責日本，事在遷延調查之後，顧非調查而始知日本之應譴責也。譴責日本之舉，是否有裨於中國，論者將不一其辭，惡意之論者，且以妄想依賴爲中國政府譏；顧乃芬蘭非不知國聯之無能爲力，非不知空言譴責蘇聯之無裨於芬蘭之艱危，而仍步武中國後塵，不憚煩勞於申訴，此其故何歟？各國明知國聯之不能有爲，猶不憚煩勞於開會，此其故何歟？謂非反證各國不問遭遇侵略與否，確乎需要國際有一最高機構歟？惟有此需要，故應謀適應此需要。適應之道，決非毀棄無能爲力之國聯，而應爲充實國聯；使不健全者趨健全，不合理者趨合理，不切實者趨切實，終使克赴使命。中國之申訴，尙未了局；芬蘭之申訴，纔告發端；國聯即使未能遽作何種有效之行動，亦應鑒於申訴之試騐，事實之敎訓，以集會之機會，就國聯之本身，亟謀澈底興革。對於世界各國，既不能强全體以就國聯之範圍，亦應標舉若干原則，糾合忠誠遵行者爲一體；除不能行之條款，除不奉行之會員。對於世界糾紛，既不能厲行制裁之方法，亦應發動仲裁，使糾紛中之各國，有重行考盧其態度之餘地，有接受仲裁之機會。陷於戰爭狀態中之國家，自信必能解決糾紛於戰爭者，必無幾國；國聯而有發動之嘗試，即使無成，亦未足爲奄奄一息之國聯詬病也</p>

<h3>東行漫記（第一信）</h3>
<p>— 張常人</p>
<p>小言</p>
<p>中華民國二十八年十一月、記者由桂林出發、以寗波爲目的地、預擬作橫斷湘贛皖浙四省腹地之旅行、</p>
<p>中日戰局、現雖向全面戰爭加速發展、惟無形中、仍有華北·華中·及華南·三大主戰塲之存在、依目前趨向推測、華北及華南兩大戰塲之戰鬥、其作用尙限於「掩護」與「牽掣」、決勝之戰還將發軔於長江南北之中央戰塲、現代戰爭之勝敗、以第一次世界大戰中之德國爲例、設無充實健全之後方、第一綫之勝利、亦屬徒然、四省腹地旅行之目的、即在視察長江以南中央戰塲後方之諸多事象、以文字重現於讀者之前、希冀或可吿慰、或堪攻錯、或足惕厲、或供評議、設欲以此作覘求戰勝與建國之卜具、則恐非記者見聞與筆力所能勝任者矣、</p>
<p>本文係在旅途中隨寫隨發者、題材選取、相當龐雜、文字結構、更難求系統、因以「漫記」爲題、張常人於江西吉安旅次—</p>
<p>一　湘桂車中</p>
<p>十一月十二日夜六時半、記者由桂林南站乘特快車北行、由京滬·津浦·隴海·平漢·粤漢·輾轉南來之藍鋼列車、仍保持其固有之華美與舒適、時値湘北會戰大捷之一個月後、西南大後方之軍民、咸以沸揚情緒樂觀當前戰局、車行後、旅客即各開始交換談話、以各種不同之解釋、證明抗戰勝利之必然性、而情緒鎮靜、使人有置身當年京滬夜快車中之感、</p>
<p>同行者、有　　　軍孫參謀　　、以軍事家眼光爲談戰局前途、頗有獨到之處、暢談結論、均深覺全國上下兩年半來之艱苦奮鬥、業經獲有成果、惟勝利愈接近、戰鬥愈艱苦、所謂「行百里者半九十」、九　一簣、實足爲當今國人於把握勝利緒端、向光明前程邁進時、所應警惕奮勉者、至夜深始各就寢、</p>
<p>桂（林）柳（州）段行將通車之湘桂鐵路、其衡（陽）桂（林）段之車務、已漸趨正常、桂術間三百六十公里、過去十八小時行畢全程、尙不免時有誤點者、今僅須十二小時即足、此綫係集全國各鐵路之人材物資、費湘桂兩省數十萬民工之汗血勞力而成、通車一週年來、已對建國大業盡其最大之努力、且行將在西南國防上發揮其偉大之潛在力、</p>
<p>二　拓展中之衡陽</p>
<p>目長沙大火、「浙贛」中斷以來、衡陽一躍而爲湘·黔·桂·粤·贛五省之交通樞紐、鐵道方面、粤漢路可北達淥口、南通油江、湘桂路即可通柳州、公路方面、湘黔·湘桂·湘粤·湘贛·衡（陽）湘（潭）各綫、均由此輻射、水道方面、北可溯湘江而通灘水、南可順流直航長（沙）湘（陰）、水陸交通之便利、不僅在軍事上形成一大據點、寖且爲湖南政治經濟之中心、衡陽有知、亦足自豪矣、</p>
<p>然衡陽以是遂成華中日空軍主要轟炸目標之一、城市爲墟、近郊鄕村亦時受荼毒、惟衡陽決未屈服、正積極向四郊拓展、以更堅强更廣大之姿態、與日空中暴力相抗、</p>
<p>六個月前、記者曾數過是間、現則面目漸新、須刮目相看、城中焦土、已漸爲新建之市房所蔽、足容數百人食宿之大飯店、亦巳在寺資本經營中、城坦正拆除、市街亦正積極放寬、城外則未經命名之大道、放射式地向四郊延仲、紅土原上、新屋點綴有緻、其構造較舊有房屋爲簡單實用、公路兩側、新興市集亦在增加中、店主類多來自淪陷地區、已一反「安土重遷」之民族習性、而爲「隨遇而安」之人生哲學家、然絕非「此地樂不思蜀」之謂、彼等眈讀日報、熱切討論時局、隨時凖備與勝戰共進、大剛報及正中日報出版較其他城市爲早、上午七時後、即可購得、此外、並有放映陳舊國產片之戲院一家、</p>
<p>湘南省當局規定、每日自上午九時起至下午四時止、爲「防空時間」、（雨雪例外）各城門隘口、由守軍監視、軍民一律「准出不准進」、故日中無市、居民亦相率向近郊鄕村疏散、以是城外茶館飯店、座客常滿、惟空襲之死傷雖可望因此减少、居民經常消耗之時間、不免過多、聞「如何利用防空時間」現已爲衡陽若干人士之話題、渴盼省當局有以敎導之云、</p>
<p>三　茶陵夜宿</p>
<p>衡陽與江西吉安間、原有公路局班車啣接行駛、近爲交通工具及材料儘先供應軍用之故、每日改在耒陽開車一輛、以利兩省行旅　自西南至東南各省之旅客、可由衡乘粵漢路車至耒陽、轉搭公路車至湘贛邊界之界化　（票價八元七角）換乘江西公路處客車赴吉安、（一五六公里、票價八元六角）但求供相去甚遠、購票困難、幸兩省公路局辦理旅客登記、尙屬認眞、登記旅客、至多稽延二日、必可就道、</p>
<p>記者因有　　　部車輛駛贛之便、於十七日上午十時離衡、下午一時至耒陽、至此與湘粤公路分歧、東行跨越耒水、經安仁縣、於下午五時抵茶陵、沿途見煤山甚多、煤層暴露地面者、亦所在多有、當地人民、正以土法開採、肩挑入市者、陸繹於途、設能積極指導協助、改以科學方法發掘、並敷設輕便軌道、以利運輸、湘南粤北各城之燃料問題　或可完全解决、</p>
<p>茶陵爲湘南偏僻縣份之一、實際上一較大之市鎭而已、因適居湘贛公路之中心、、東來及西去車輛、必須在此間宿夜、故旅棧業異常發達·汽車站附近、旅館飯館、鱗次櫛比均尙廉潔、市街成曲尺形，未經日機蹂躪、人民生活、似甚安樂、</p>
<p>四　蓮花一瞥</p>
<p>十八日黎明、，由茶陵啟程東行、九時許過界化壟、有憲兵若干駐此檢查往來車輛及軍民、此寂寞小村、乃亦因在此候車之旅客而日趨繁榮、過此、即入江西省蓮花縣境、</p>
<p>贛省公路、較湘省稍窄、且少修補、路面破壞不平、此綫爲過去內戰時之軍用路、應用涵洞之處、多架小木橋爲代、數年來未經改築、毀損者時有見及、設司機稍不經心、或在夜間行車、即有肇事之虞、爲便利軍運計、江西省公路處有立即予以修葺或改建之必要、</p>
<p>蓮花過去爲紅軍根據地之一、傳縣境各地、均曾爲血戰塲、現則時過境遷、陳跡亦難覆按、蓋山頂隘路之碉堡、巳開始拆毀、一磚一石、過去取諸民間者、復均還諸民間、作工農民、多欣然搬運、以爲建築房屋填補道路之用、蓮花城垣之一、已於十月一日起至十五日間、動員全縣民衆完全拆平、城鄉房屋、粉墻黑雉、高大堅實、咸類閥閱人家、可稱蓮花之特色、竹籬茅舍、僅偶一見之、惟農民生活、終甚貧困、</p>
<p>坐車停於汽車站附近、一老者揖於道傍、操皖北口音、邀余等入「蘇浙皖贛難民飯店」就餐、蓋係四省難民合資開設者、記者與陳君共餐、計有鮮菇　炒冬筍、肉片炒白菜、葱炒鷄蛋、紅燒荳腐、蛋湯及飯、僅取値六角六分而已、此間爲贛省產米區、食米每石售法幣六元、鷄蛋每元四十枚、可見中國抗戰卅閱月來，都會生活指數雖繼　續增高、大部城鄕除日用製品外、仍能保持正常狀態、惟食鹽因運輸關係、每元僅可購一斤半、下午三時過安福縣、多數民工正努力拆除城墻、一小時後、抵贛中重鎭之吉安、（十一月二十日吉安）</p>

<h3>輔幣恐慌解除　一元券發兌　分幣券今日核發　大批角票將運滬</h3>
<p>中中交農四行爲救濟滬市輔幣券缺乏恐慌、除於八日發行二批分幣券外、並由港運到一元新券發兌、同時由市商會取締儲藏牟利、電財政部迅速增印輔幣券運滬接濟、茲誌詳情如下、</p>

<h3>冬日漫步　—法國公園素描—</h3>
<p>— 霜君</p>
<p>星期六下午，在小學四年級的鍾兒和幼雅園的敏兒都沒有課。飯後與霞商議去看戲而沒有結果，爲的是今天因買米的鉅額開支，使我惱恨極了。—米，頭號常帮每石四十六元，二號常帮四十二元；米商笑逐顏開，小民食不下嚥。—走吧，二三星期沒去公園了，便呌女傭騙開了最小的霖兒，携着鍾敏二兒，心裏還緊壓着米的惱恨，走到了法國公園門口</p>
<p>園門前意外的靜寂。平常爲便利沒有「派司」的遊客兌換鎳角子買臨時票的小孩們也不見了。天冷，遊客稀；他們的「生意」因此也做不成了。一枚鎳角子，要賺三分錢的貼水，生意很不差呀；可是現在他們失去了投機的機會，而遊客却也感覺不便。我問司閣人沒有鎳角子怎麼買票，他說華龍路口的票房門口可換。於是不得不再繞到華龍路的門口去。</p>
<p>「喂！鎳角子要嗎」？一個面有菜色的襤褸中年男子，手中玩弄着許多鎳角子的響聲問我。</p>
<p>「要貼幾分」？我問。</p>
<p>「一角貼三分」他提出兌價</p>
<p>「二分行不行」？我衣袋裏只有兩分一個的電車上的鎢幣。我問他是否可以减低一分的貼水。</p>
<p>「不行，我本錢還要二分呢」。</p>
<p>我不願再給他糾纏，走向公園門口去。順便買了三包五香荳，給一毛紙幣，找進四分。這個兌鎳角子人看見我有了分幣，他又跑近來接洽這筆生意，但我沒有睬他。走到了公園門口的售票處，投進一張一角錢的紙幣，不折不扣地兌到了一枚一角的鎳角子，投進了吃角子老虎似的售票機器，取得票子，帶了大小兩兒勝利地踱進了法國公園。</p>
<p>剛進園門就看見一個四五歲的女小孩、在司　人旁邊啼哭，據說她的母親走散了。使我想起了工部局兒童保障科和慈幼會最近所收留的大批孤兒，不覺悵然！</p>
<p>一個月前，正當「秋高蟹肥，持鰲賞菊」的時候，那時的法國公園顯着異樣的葱鬱，梧桐張開盛大的技葉，菊花盛開，逗引着人們流運賞玩。您手挽着惰侶，在梧桐的夾道中踱着，驕陽從濃密蒼翠底樹葉罅隙裏偷偷地向你微笑，祝福；走着，走着，慢條斯理地走着，漫步到草地上，走進花畦邊；那時您倆的心胸中，充滿着「無言之美」，感覺到人生的偉大！可是現在這些景物不再有了。靑春的情愛原只是一刹那的時間，冷酷的風霜，剝奪了花木豐潤的生命，靑春易逝，落葉片片，現在只剩下了乾枯的枝桿。</p>
<p>遊人是稀少了，可是道幾天並不怎樣冷呀；應該說是暖和的冬日、風輕輕地吻着面額，太陽煦麗地撫摩着您，兩顋如酒後飛上兩朶紅雲。孩兒們在草地上嬉戲，天眞的稚氣使她們忘却了一星期來坐硬板凳的苦楚。簡陋的噴水池邊，四圍坐着悠閒的男女，有的看書，有的相依喁喁。</p>
<p>「這水不停地噴出來，怎麼池裏的水不會泛濫出來呢」？鍾兒指着池中的噴水好奇地問。</p>
<p>走到大池邊坐了下來。看到對面向陽的一面，一株梧桐的葉子還沒有完全脫落，太陽往疏稀的葉子反映出刺目的光輝；樹林的夾道下，遠遠窺去，人影恍惚、偶然有一二位年靑的女子，在對面的小橋上踱過。我有意無意地問鍾兒有沒有帶着鉛筆，他說沒有；其實帶着鉛筆又怎麼辦呢？我深悔並沒有能够學會繪畫啊！我當時眞想把這情景描繪下來。</p>
<p>於是我又走到對面那株梧桐樹下，在半圓形的堤岸上坐下了，恰巧有三把空椅子，我們各人佔有一隻。面對太陽，雙目緊閉，靜聆葉聲颯颯，風和日麗，眞是醉人欲睡。池中金色鯉魚，長約四五寸，往來遊逐，向水面覓食。敏兒把荳嚼碎後吐入水去，移時，水底浮起一層金黃色，數百尾金魚悠閒地遊來，爭食荳屑，把尖嘴向上一吮，又掉尾急遽地下沉。我好奇地捲起袖子，守候池邊，等魚來爭食時，便很快地伸手去捉。有一會被我捉住一個魚頭，但仍舊給掙脫了。在石岸的沿邊罅隙處，忽發現許多小蝦，鍾兒也卸下了外衣，伸手去捉，結果共捉着了九隻，不住地在手裏跳躍，最後又將牠們放下水去。</p>
<p>偶而來一陣微風，把池水吹起許多縐紋。太陽漸漸西下，蕭條的園中，披上一層輝煌的金光。我們與魚伴吿別，興步走向動物園去。</p>
<p>「噲，我們幾時到滬西　　　俱樂部去好嗎？那里眞好玩。」</p>
<p>我聽得背後有人說話，原來是兩位西裝少年。我懷疑滬西什麼俱樂部之類的魔力之偉大。</p>
<p>又買了票子，走進動物園。這些禽獸原早就看厭了的，但敏兒每次來總要去看看十幾隻猴兒，而事實上看猴兒的人的確最多，且不像看獅虎飛鳥等一顧而去，常常許多人圍着牠們，捉弄牠們，投食物給牠們吃。這也許因爲猴兒是人類的祖宗，多少帶一些人性，正如人類多少還帶一些猴性一樣。譬如你投入一粒花生米等的食物，猴兒們追逐搶奪，但結果常常給那隻最兇悍也最大的猴兒搶去，小猴們經不得大猴的一聲咆哮都急急逃竄，但人們爲憐惜小猴起見，往往乘大猴不注意的時候，把食物投給小猴們吃，孩兒們看了都拍手稱快，樂而忘返。但猴類畢竟是天生野蠻的同類相殘者，整個人類的世界，還不是和猴類一樣！</p>
<h3>外輪華工失業者　二千餘人　分批來滬　轉輪回籍</h3>

<h3>夫婦知識　夫婦間永相恩愛的秘訣</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培　性病專科醫師詹念會　合著</p>
<p>（診所）北京路四川路口中國信託公司二樓</p>
<p>（時間）上午十時至下午六時星期日休息</p>
<p>打開天窗說亮話，夫婦是性關係的結合，一個靑年男子討了一個少女爲妻子，那在婚禮完畢之後，除非有暗疾或其他原因之外，沒有不完成他倆燕好的。我們以女子的性情而論，她在處女時代對於她的終生配偶，理想一定很高。有時竟會在夢境中出現着如何精强力壯奮發有爲的男性在向她獻媚嫵愛，她是如何的幸福而光榮着，假使她一旦嫁了一個痿弱無能，志氣消沉的丈夫，她必然感覺失望，在夫婦關係中所必有的性生活中，如果不能美滿，或因丈夫有暗疾，竟不能人道。那夫婦關係，根本就無法維持，愛情更從何處談起。於是每演出家庭間的種種悲劇！男子何以虧弱無能，暗疾叢生，據新醫學上的論斷，最多數的原因爲早年犯有自凟惡癖，或遺精失治，或早婚斵慾，或荒淫無度，或憂勞斷傷等，摧殘了生殖腺內分泌機能，於是凡滑精漏精，早洩陽痿，發育不全，腎虧乏嗣，腦弱健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，神經弱衰等症卽不一而足。此種男子，不特難爲丈夫，陷入人生慘境，就是爲學習業，亦必一無成就，前途暗淡無望，或竟未老先衰，早年殀殤，其危機爲何似！</p>
<p>欲謀夫婦永相恩愛，事業前途遠大，那精力豐足，確保健康爲唯一秘訣。萬一不幸男子因早年浪漫而而患有上述症象，尤應及早作澈底根治。切不可拖延，致一誤再誤。治療之法，據世界名醫千萬病案及余多年經騐，均以服生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』最爲對症特效。因此劑係由雄壯動物體中提取的生殖腺內分泌精華，用利學複製法製成，成分完全保存。所以品質名貴，功效確實，爲任何類似製劑所不及。服用此劑於一日夜間卽生精補腎，健腦活血，連服不斷，則更調整新陳代謝，助長發育，滋養神經，短期內必能根治各症。冬春常服，延年益壽，返老還童。惟有逍精者須兼服世界馳名治遺聖藥『希米脫氏固精片』以固精關，制止遺洩，收效尤速！</p>
<p>患者顧福祥君，浙人，年廿五歲，因早婚縱慾，致患腎虧乏嗣，早洩陽痿兼有遺精等症，初時夫婦感情尙篤，今者日漸淡薄，其妻屢有要求離婚之意。顧君爲根本治愈其疾病計，乃就木診所診治，經察知其確實病狀後，卽囑其在中西大藥房購『生殖素』三打及『希米脫氏固精片』兩打，使之兼服，並用電療注射等新療術，爲時不過兩月，今己百病痊愈，心歡體胖，並聞其夫人已獲熊夢之兆云。</p>
<h3>健美　乳峯萎癟最理想之補救</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>凡是女性，都有道麼兩大企求：一是在處女時代，希望似含苞初放的鮮花一般美麗，能够到處香噴噴，甜蜜蜜，被人稱贊『這位姑娘多麼美』，結果嫁得一位好丈夫。一是出嫁以後希望丈夫的性情似留蘭香糖一般又軟又香又溫柔、雙方情好彌篤，生幾位小天使在身邊跳跳躍躍，過着她的快樂日子。</p>
<p>這樣的企求，當然不能說過分妄想，但要眞能獲得這樣幸福，據法國婦科名醫威泥基與美國百特生醫院院長魯興博士等研究結果。第一必須使身體有充分的發育，而尤其必須使乳峯隆然高聳，因乳峯能夠高聳而有彈性，不僅可以和臀部搆成最神秘而可愛的曲線，使人陶醉愛慕，同時由於卵巢機能的健全，新陳代謝作用的旺盛之故，性情亦無不溫良柔順，肌肉丯腴，面色紅潤而嫵媚，誠能這樣健美，追求的人自然必多，揀一個好丈夫還成什麼問題。不寗惟是，即從生育上講，此輩女性因體格健全，經事的準確，個性的溫良，所生的子女，亦必活潑伶俐，玉人可愛。反之，如乳峯萎癟，臀部瘦削，健美喪失者，不特自身多病多痛，毫無快樂健爽的日子，而在姿態上看來，更被時代男子們嗤之以鼻，於是春花秋月，空閨唏噓，長夜漫漫，淚濕枕畔！此中酸辛，簡直有不堪爲外人道者。然則處此科學萬能時代，聰明的女士們；何不速以動物卵巢製劑女用『生殖素』以挽救之。此劑治乳癟顏衰及一切女子暗病均有特效。服後一日夜間即可培補卵巢機能，旺盛新陳代謝作用，調整月經，暖宮止帶，以繼續連服一冬，雖白髮亦能轉黑，老態亦能還少，區區乳峯發育，誠九拿十穩事也。</p>
<h3>遺精失治的將自誤誤人</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>兒童的健康是父母遺傳和敎養的效果，靑年和成人的健康那才是他自愛的成績。在春情發動期的靑年，要是不知自愛，犯有自凟惡癖，同性鷄奸，早婚縱慾等行爲，斵傷了性神經，使精關鬆弛後，則必繼起着可怕的遺精，遺精一起，我們生命的源泉即時有遺洩而不不能貯藏。那在此寒冷的冬天更爲危險！「冬不藏精，春必病瘟」。這是誰都知道的常識。要是以爲遺精症的無痛無癢，而因循失治，那必繼起腦衰健忘，失眠亂夢，腰酸背痛，腎虧乏嗣，早洩陽痿，發育不全等症。英雄只怕病來磨，此種靑年，雖有天大志願，雖曾有銅筋鐵骨的身體，亦必萎靡不振，志氣消沉，在此冬令，益覺手寒脚冷，時作顫抖，傷風咳嗽，更不一而足，如在學校之學生，如何能孜孜不倦於學業，因此成績慘落人後，或竟退學失學，如在工商界從事於職業者，更不能勝任愉快，亦有失業的危險！若在男女戀愛塲中，夫婦性愛生活上，那更因此而演出失戀失歡等種種悲劇者，在今日社會中亦屬多不勝計！</p>
<p>遺精靑年欲免自誤誤人，必須及早作澈底治療。治療之法，據世界千萬名醫病案及余多年經騐，均以服治遺精聖藥『希米脫氏固精片』（五洲華美大藥房均售每匣實價兩元）功效最爲確實而迅速，服後即可於當夜鞏固精關，鎭靜神經，受安眠止遺之效。若已有上述症象者，須兼服雄性動物生殖腺素製劑『生殖素』以生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，助長發育，繼續服用，必可於短期內根治各症，而益臻健康。患者如能親來診所兼施電療注射等新療法，必可保證治癒。</p>

<h3>洋米公正價不到念元</h3>
<p>— 鮑樂蒂</p>
<p>報載每石洋米也要三十八九元，理由是外滙縮與水脚貴。然據星洲日報所載：本年七月份的仰光米價為：</p>
<p>仰光米價（每七五〇〇磅羅比價）</p>
<p>上面的貨量單位是七五〇〇磅，貨幣單位是羅比。於是按〇·九〇七四折合市担，按本月九日印滙百元合二三·五羅比（即每一羅比等於四元二角六分弱），則每市担之售價為：</p>
<p>仰光米合每担法幣價</p>
<p>上價之折法為：RS.÷（7500×0.9074）×＄4，26</p>
<p>當時新米尚未上市，故價較貴；然以今日滙價計算，每市担亦不過十四五元。在新米上市之今日，仰光售價想必較前為賤，決無反漲之理。是則無論水脚如何昂貴，也不會到每担近四十元。據吾人所知：戰前上海至仰光的運費，每噸不過十一二元，即每担不過扯到一元一二角。若統扯每担加費以五元計算，仰光米在滬售價亦不會超過二十元明甚！</p>
<h3>日本財力的分析（上）</h3>
<p>— 朱時暉摘譯</p>
<p>中日戰事，已越兩載。日本的財力，是否再能維持長期的戰爭，實為吾人急切要求解答的問題。本文係摘譯Amerasia九月號所載「Japan′s　Financial　Capacity　for　War」一文，原作者A.　Grajdanzco氏，就客觀的立塲，可靠的數字，以分析日本財政能力之强弱，頗足為吾人參考。今以其大意迻譯於後：</p>
<p>在近代的戰爭中，交戰國雙方財政資源的豐足與否，或其經濟能力之强弱與否，無疑地是取得勝利的一個首要因素。在這次的中日戰爭中，我們就兩國的經濟情形比較，日本顯然處於較優越的地位，因為她的經濟機構在戰前早已現代化了。同時，因為戰塲在中國的緣故，她的許多工商城市並沒有遭到空襲與佔領，而她的海外貿易也沒有像中國一樣的受着封鎖的威脅，她的稅收也並不受戰事的影響而减少，至於中國，戰時的財政地位與戰前比較，就不能同日而語，因為她在戰前的幾種重要稅收現已喪失了。</p>
<p>我們要明瞭日本在戰時的一切財政收支，最好拿她在戰前一年度（一九三六年四月一日到一九三七年三月三十一日）的預算來比較。或者有人會說：日本戰前一年度的預算，不能作為平時的預算看待，因為她在那年度已經走上了備戰的路。但是如果我們看了本文下面所載的各項比較數字，就可明瞭一九三六—三七這個年度的預算，與戰時幾個年度的預算，還是有着很大的增减。我們現在先拿一九三六—三七年度，一九三七—三八年度的實際收付數額，與一九三八—三九年度，和一九三九—四〇年度的估計預算數來比較。因為本文以研究日本的財力為對象，所以對於日本政府歲收的分析，特別注意，而對於其經費支出方面，僅列有關戰爭的各項費用，及其對於歲收的百分比。下表就是日本政府歷年度歲入歲出的比較</p>
<p>上表中關於海陸軍費的支出中，包括徵兵，軍用醫院，傷兵療養，軍事救濟各項費用，以及軍事特別會計解納金。（此項基金是否已全數用去，我們不得而知。）由上表觀察，吾人可發現一點：就是一九三九—四〇年度的歲收，較之一九三六—三七年度的歲收，增加歲達四倍。日本政府的歲收可以分為如下四項：（一）租稅收入，（二）官業官產收入，（三）公債及其他借款收入，（四）雜項收入。我們如以一九三六—三七年度的各類歲收作為基數，就可求得以後三年度各類歲收的增加率如後：</p>
<p>附此發物價指數及另售物價指數如下：（以一九三六為基年）</p>
<p>從上表，我們可以看出一九三九—四〇年度的普通稅收入較一九三六—三七年度增加六%，專賣局益金收入增加一二%，官業官產收入增加一二%，至於營業收益稅及所得稅的收入則增加到三三五%，其中增加得最快的，莫過於政府的借款收入，共增九二七%。同時我們還可以看出在一九三九—四〇年度，除了借款收入及營業稅所得稅收入外，沒有一類收入，（雜項收入例外，因其性質為其他各種收入之合併數）。其增加的程度，能越過物價增高的程度者。</p>
<p>日本政府歷年各類歲入的增加率旣如上述我們現在更進一步的以各類收入的數額及其對於歲收總數的百分比列後：</p>
<h3>日本對外貿易的當前危機（續）</h3>
<p>— 原著者　約翰阿煦勒　伯明譯自密勒氏評論報</p>
<p>日本旣將遇這些困難，且因歐戰而遭遇的貿易難　，决未解決，除日元集團之外，日本的對歐貿易，佔其輸出的百分之十五，和輸入的百分之十六，這種貿易現已喪失一大部份，在日本自全歐輸入中佔半數的對德輸入，完全截斷，已歷數月，蘇聯將否置橫貫西伯利亞鐵路於日德支配下，以供大規模的過境交通，是個完全公開的問題，多半將看東京向莫斯科提供，作為酬報的讓步而定，約在六星期前，日本和歐洲協約國談判，得到德國從海上輸出，運往日本的工業設備品，協約國不加干涉的確定保證，但同時，這種保證已因協約國阻止德國一切輸出品的决議而失效，協約國，甚至中立國包括義國在內，對於日本訂購許多工業品的定單，不予履行，而使日本惶惶不安，再加航運的困難，那末，歐戰最初三月中，日本輸入大减，而迫令日本對其工業擴張計劃，縮小范圍，擴展時間，便不足驚奇了。</p>
<p>日本的輸出業在歐戰的動力下，不規則的發展着，九月份全月中，日本輸出品的價値激增，將近九月底，達到特殊的高度，在十月份的最先三星期，却告劇跌，其後又激减，日本的若干種輸出品，如運往德國的，已被戰事所截斷，但德國在日本的輸出中，祇佔日本對非日元集團運輸的百分之二·五，這種損失，已因輸往亞洲市塲的日本棉布玻璃片和其他若干種貨品的大增加而暫時抵銷了。日本生絲價格大漲，在橫濱每包自日金一千三百元漲到了二千元，但又跌至一千八百五十元，日本對美輸出的總數中，生絲幾乎佔十分之八，所以，日本對美輸出的日元價格數字大增。</p>
<p>輸入旣减而輸出價値高漲，日本對日元集團以外諸國的貿易差額，大見好轉，在本年最初八個月中，平均每月入超日金六千萬元，在十月祗入越二百萬元，但這是日金六千萬元，在十月份祗入超二百萬元，但這是不能持久的暫時現象而已，因為（一）每年最後三月，常是日本貿易差額最有利的時期，（二）其後幾個月中，日本對美輸入將見大增，因為新近向美國添訂貨物的大批定單都將履行，（三）棉布和玻璃片等輸出的繁榮必定是曇花一現，已往二月中，日本運出舊存的貨物，它的輸出才見增加，而日本所以能使存貨脫手的主要原因是日元貶値，和重行調整這些貨物的價格水準，來適應外國買主之故。棉布和玻璃輸出增加，同時日本國內却因原料和電力益缺，所以這些貨物的製造續見减少，棉布和玻璃等存貨，行將告罄，屆時這些輸出品，將告停止。</p>
<p>日本將因歐戰，而再享到有利的輸出希望，這種希望已經實現，但中國戰爭阻使日本不能從這可能性中獲利，近幾過來，日本接到的定單和詢問書，有（一）舊金山，加爾各答，巴拿馬，巴西，西非，埃及和盤谷訂購罐頭食物，乾食品，機械，人造絲綢緞，玻璃，和磁器，（二）墨西哥訂購鐵管，人造絲織物，紙張和夾板，（三）印度訂購四萬噸漂白粉，（四）挪威訂購蔴袋五百萬隻，發出這些定單和詢問書的都想採辦日貨，而他們所需這些貨物，以前却不是從日本輸入的，但是，戰有這些情報的東京促進對外貿易中央聯合會報告書上，却悲切地說，日本工業現在所處地位，已不能履行這些定單，日本所能獲得的外匯基金，悉數擱置着，預備用又購買在明年一月二十六日前，能自美國獲得的任何種戰具，日本現已無力另購外國原料來製造更多的輸出品，東京大藏省對於平時工業申請加撥外滙的，繼續盡加拒絕，甚至下令更加减小撥給平時工業，以輸入原料的外匯。</p>
<p>日本新近跟着英鎊貶値，也是日本對外貿易的大難題，日本輸出品，大部份售給幣値也已低落的各國祇小部份輸出口運往為日元貶値所鼓動的其他國家，就他方面說，日本輸入口却大部份來自新近未曾貶低幣價的各國，這些出口品售給日本，價价大漲，日元貶値百分之十五，自動的使美元價値對日本入口商增高百分之十八，近幾週來，日本的經濟報紙紛紛談及日本國內的價物水準，較其他多數國家為高，已歷幾年，近來世界的價格水準激漲，據說已重行調整日本和盎格魯薩克遜諸國間的物價關係，而於日本有利，但東京政府若能遏止日本國內的物價繼漲和日元跌價，才能保持這種利益，東京政府在這方面很少成功之望，且官方規定物價不得越過九月十八日的水準，但極重要的商品絲棉織物和米却已超過這水準，照現象看，日本國內的特價水準將繼續飛漲用</p>
<p>綜之，日本對外貿易現遇空前的困難和障碍，東京政府至今不能設法解決日本對外商業的任何迫切大難題，東京多半將循一種路綫，那便是作最小的抵抗，轉而求援於在華侵佔地，减少對日元集團區輸出的日貨，同時在中國境內所佔地，加緊榨取它所能獲得的任何種原料或其他供應品。　（完）</p>

<h3>四十五元新限價</h3>
<p>— 予</p>
<p>奸商高抬米價，連米號業公會蘇祖勛先生都公開指摘（見六日報載），從米業七團體重整米業交易程序的通告中，也可想見奸商搗亂米市的蛛絲馬跡。輿論對於奸商毫無用處，否則就不成其為奸商。公會的通告不起作用，否則也不致弄到這步田地！反在這通告公佈之後，米價更漲近每石五十元的空前高價。各方殷殷盼望租界當局出而制裁，保障民食。總算未使各方失望，辦法來了：最高價不得超過四十五元！升斗小民眞正受惠匪淺！但是一般資方要着急了，因為不知將如何保障他職員生計了？我們希望工部局根據這個新限價，再來公佈一個職工薪給的最低標準！</p>
<h3>日本新預算</h3>
<p>— 予</p>
<p>日本明年度新預算總額一百零四萬萬元，比本年度又增十萬萬元。有了一架印刷機，不怕沒有財源。有了警視廳和經濟警察，也不怕人民對於强烈統制和高物價的反抗。人民在惡性通貨膨脹下的掙扎和呻吟，可以封鎖在監獄裏使之不得外洩。「日本評論」裏有位作者主張把囚犯送上中國戰塲。因為他在替人滿為患的監獄着急。但軍部竭力反對這個辦法，因為軍隊裏的反戰情緒已高漲極點，所以主張監禁為妙。可是商工省和農林省之類不贊成，因為人力不足的恐慌愈鬧愈厲害。所以編造鉅額預算果然並無大問題，問題在因此而加速日本整個經濟機構澈底崩潰的過程，束手無策。</p>

<h3>為什麼有許多男子</h3>
<p>— 俄國勞動大學　婚後會精力衰退？</p>
<p>現在社會上常有許多離婚的慘劇演出，構成此種慘劇的原因雖有多端，然主要的一點都由於愛情的不能融合所致，因男女之愛，須從健康中鍜鍊而來，能喪失此健康的體魄，則任憑你有優裕的生活環境，也是徒然！</p>
<p>要保持吾人的健康不因結婚生活而喪失，則第一問題，端賴婚前之善保童貞，切忌自凟，婚後尤宜節慾，庶旣兩性愛情，不致因一時生殖力之缺乏而頽然自廢，但如果眞有生殖力失常的話，切不可諱疾忌醫，除對於生殖的衛生格外注意外，並宜採用德國最有功效的靑春腺素製劑男用「補體康」則生殖力告返老還童，愛情亦永久如新矣，</p>
<p>生殖雖為人類天賦本能，然因性感的感受性發生病象，以致失却夫婦之樂趣者，未始無之，在醫學上名曰性機能衰弱症，如早洩，陰萎，及女性常患之不感症是也，患此實為自身體質衰弱之症象，年過四十的人，因生理關係，生殖的熱力减退，此蓋由於主宰性力的靑春腺由强轉弱之故，因一人的性慾隨年歲的增加而逐轉消失，此不僅生殖如此，凡精神，皮膚等處亦然，今旣明瞭生殖的健全在靑春腺的繁榮，故德國性病專家梅倫博士所發明之雄壯動物睪丸內分泌製劑「補體康」，確為二十四紀醫學結晶的偉大發明，服後腦力淸爽，精神振作，面色紅潤，食慾增進，生殖機能非常健全，絕無早洩，陰萎等病狀，且能促進生育機能幫助性器發育，能恢復中年人的生殖力，補腦，補腎，補血，均具卓效，實為老幼滋補聖品，其女用「補體康」為調經種子，治療貧血乳癟的對症良藥，尤其對於婚後所生之不感症，一服本劑，頓變多情矣。不過靑年患有遺精滑精，除服「補體康」之外。應兼以「耐而斯遺精片」止之，功效遠駕固精片之上。</p>
<p>淋病春秋</p>
<h3>淋病之解放</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師撰述</p>
<p>二十世紀中之醫學進步史上，以淋病療法為最，當初風行一時之療法，以透膜殺菌法為最，但因淋菌不是完全在粘膜上者，凡是血液關節等處，莫不有淋菌之踪跡。所以此種透膜殺菌療法，卽宣告徹底失敗。而德國醫學博士彼德氏，作進一步之研究，用特種蛋白體黃色素混合製成「克淋儂」一藥，服後能在短期內，發生抗淋噬菌，消炎鎭痛之作用，此種作用，能直接發生於病灶，可稱為淋痛患者得到惟一解放之療法。</p>
<p>淋法患者一旦被淋菌所傳染，猶如毒蝎在身，痛苦非凡，往往有厭世自殺之謬想。而其最感痛苦之淋病，無過於淋毒性後尿道炎之症狀。因為淋毒一朝入于後尿道後，卽感到甚大之麻煩。以其淋菌所侵入之路線增多，而變症自亦蜂起，假如用一般透膜殺菌，及化學療法，其殺菌作用，未必能擋得起如水銀瀉地，無孔不入之淋菌，過去淋病之不能短期根治者，其故卽在於此。</p>
<p>現在因有「克淋儂」之發明，故淋病之療法，大異疇昔，久為歐美各國醫家所贊佩，據白賽仲博士在其紐約所設花柳病院之實騐，謂余在該院，前後經過治療淋病者，于二十年內，何止千萬人，而在「克淋儂」未發明以前，要求淋病根治，殊感棘手。惟自「克淋儂」一藥發明之後，根治各期淋病，已不若從前之困難矣。尤其淋病已侵入後尿道者，如服用「克淋儂」絕對可以根治，藥性王道，成績優良。　　在外用藥方面，則「抗淋水」一藥，對於男子洗滌尿道，掃除淋菌，女子淋毒白帶，可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」為坐藥，以排除淋毒白帶，則對與男女一切淋病，更為有效。並極合家庭自療之原則。</p>

<p>遺精確阻碍靑年發育及健康最列的毛病，近代醫學進步，對於遺精一症的治法，已臻登峯造極之境，惟患者惑於效力低劣之固精藥宣傳，致延誤病機及虛擲金錢者不乏其人，本余等歷年來治療本症的經騐所知，德國性病專家所發明之「耐而斯遺精片」確其超特之卓效，因該劑成分以安眠健腦，解除射精中樞的過敏狀態為主的。不若他種固精片含有霸烈之成分以麻痺精關，有時非但不能迅速見效，且一經停服，遺精必再爆發，或且有變本加厲之可能，此與用嗎啡治鴉片癮同一原因，余等本醫師的立塲，今特鄭重忠告患者，在服他種固精片而感到宿疾難愈者，則「耐而斯遺精片」値得一試，服後確可神志淸爽，夜眠安枕，淫夢不發，精關日固。遺精遂治，但同時應戒絕自凟，有賢虧而神經衰弱者，並宜輔以德國睪丸精質製劑男用「補體康」以固陰補血，兩藥同服，確有特殊之功，此外臨床上之所證實者。</p>
<p>淋病座談</p>
<h3>頑固白濁的有效處置</h3>
<p>— 姚菊巖醫師撰</p>
<p>診所：寗波路九號四川路口</p>
<p>淋病一入慢性，因其變症良多，病菌分佈各處，猶如已成燎原之火，一時頗難撲滅，因其徒衆繁多，變症百出，故不但淋病患者愕然而驚，卽經騐不足，見識不廣的醫家，亦多茫然不辨其為何種症狀，因之淋病亦愈趨險惡之一途，而不能迅速把牠銷滅。弄成攻之不久，削之不去之頑固性的白濁，到那時淋病的患者，已經感到生命的岌岌可危，如果此時而仍徘徊瞻顧，那末淋病之後果，更不堪設想了。</p>
<p>在患頑固而最危險的淋症，要算全身淋毒性傳染性的淋病了，而全身淋毒性之傳染，又以關節炎，敗血症之病症最為險惡。因為前者能使四肢關節，因炎症而愈着，行動不靈，形同殘廢。至於後者因淋毒的關係，而致敗血症，每有使生命立時傾覆之厄運。故關於此等病毒時，絕對不能用局部手術療治，加以解決，而必須用淋病特效藥「克淋儂」，使殺菌力直達病灶，並將散處關節及血液間之淋菌，完全撲滅之，因「克淋儂」一藥，服後能於最短期內，發生抗淋菌的作用，包圍所有的淋菌而抗殺之。一方更輔佐德國抗淋血淸，感應靜電療法，Wettere　X療法，能使淋毒餘蘊肅淸，並使膠着之關節處，加以分解。則運動自如，卽對於淋毒性敗血症，亦能挽治　診時：上午十時至下午六時自卽日起每天送診廿號每號僅取號金五角，並贈性病全書一册　兼治梅毒橫痃下疳及性神經衰弱等症。</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>米價又貴了</h3>
<p>— 陸利時</p>
<p>這眞是一件破天荒的事，收獲時期米價蒸蒸日上，要是在往年，這時的米價至多—餘塊錢一擔、　白米賣了十五六塊已算是難得的了，所以大家對於這「民以食爲天」的問題都處之泰然的過去。但是現在呢？三十元一石的米有了鈔票還喊不到，是不是缺米？看看每家米店的棧房裏都堆疊得高高的再探聽一下，全上海倉庫中有米存積的也小少，那末究竟爲了，什麼米價不會賤？</p>
<p>這有好幾點理由，一來源不能合乎理想，往往大量的「米源」突然給別人來一下「扣留」，於是　個的市塲，就起變化，價格動　不定，聰明的商人那會不混水裏弗撈魚，因此米的價格逗留在頂點上是意中事了。</p>
<p>還有一點是市儈的手段，明明自己的店棧裏　很多貨色，一聽到有米運來多方設計去爭購，買者愈多，米價依舊不跌，於是米店老闆的袋袋照樣「馬卡」「馬卡」苦的只是升斗小民，嚴冬來了，一衣食住行那一項先得解決，我想，這問題雖然租界當局和慈善家們非常重視，儘量想方法解決，不過這都有緣木求魚的「吃力」，因爲這問題牽連到國家的　問題。只有一法，我們戮力同心來做到，在消極方面確乎可以收效，就是「節米」，譬如每個人每天一升的食量减去十分之　，吃　升的吃四合，這樣，肚子不一定仍舊難熬，個人家庭可以因之節省經濟支出，整個社會上「量的供應」也可以减少，以前吃二十塊錢一擔米過去，現在吃二十塊錢七斗米也　去，如此，也許民生問題的大憂，今有些消弭的可能。</p>
<h3>添製新衣</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>眼　米珠薪桂，衣料自然不例外便宜，一套羢布短衫褲的代價也需七八元，長袍子更不必說，　常十多塊錢的已經很出客，現在二十多塊錢一襲還不體面，小職員一個月的薪金，　够披在身上，是以非到萬不得己，不會添製新衣。這是物價强制你節省。</p>
<p>但當你必需添製新衣時，父不能專　打小算盤，一丈四尺衣料才够，想省五寸的錢，只買一丈　尺半，結果成衣匠不够裁，勉强用手術把衣料拉長，做好穿上身，不到兩天，衣服縮短，再經水洗，更短起來，貪小便宜，反吃大虧，何等得不償失。</p>
<p>剪衣料非但　剪足，寗可多剪五寸一尺，一旦衣領被頭　擦壞，尙有餘料可重縫一領配上，因爲衣料的花紋顏色繁多，到店家去配買不着的。縱有，店家未必歡迎做二寸三寸的小交易。下擺貼邊也容易損壞，多些零料修補，就有備　患了。</p>
<p>我們雖不必爲衣服做牛馬，但這樣昂貴的物質，不得不隨時珍惜，到外面去接洽業務，固須顧及儀　體面，考究衣着，然家居或在辦公房中，與賓各謀面，儘　穿舊袍子老棉襖，或加件罩衫，易於洗滌。很　許多中資　級，把綢緞呢羢作家常穿着，破舊後，又籌資添製，這才眞是爲衣服做奴隸了。</p>
<p>假使是一襲襯羢袍子，面子夾裏　破了，襯在中間的絨布是不會破的，儘可拆出換在新袍子裏，算　角錢　尺吧，也可省掉　塊多錢。還有破在下擺的長袍，儘可剪裁一下，改爲短襖，短襖的衣袖破了，也得改一件背心，一舉手之勞，便有助於經濟多多。</p>
<h3>閒話橋樑</h3>
<p>— 沈錫身</p>
<p>橋樑的建造，原爲便利運輸，發達交通；使南北或東西兩岸的人和貨物，以至一切文化，往來流通；造福人羣，方便公衆，這是人所共知的！</p>
<p>在杭嘉湖屬的一帶鄉間，因爲那邊河港縱橫，永流交叉，而橋樑却不很多，即使有，不是架幾根木頭，便是鋪幾塊石板，大都是很簡陋的；有時爲了沒有橋，便不得不使你大兜其圈子，耗時費力，這便是沒橋之累了！但在大都市中，這情形便不同了，試看上海短短的一條蘇州河，而橋樑却有上幾座之多！眞是「行人如　，車馬如龍，」往來之便，交通之利，就遠非一般鄉間所能及其萬一了！</p>
<p>在內地一般城鎭中，大槪都還保持着舊式的橋樑樑：一塊塊的石級，疊成階層，雖然步行尙稱便利，但却妨碍了車輪的前進，所以有些城鎭中，已將這種橋樑拆造，而改建爲微斜式的平橋了，這樣便能使車輪易於前進，而得到交通的利益，</p>
<p>新式橋樑構造之精美，眞可使人嘆服！水泥鋼骨，石桿鐵柱，造得何等堅固！橋面平坦寬闊，無論何種草輛，都能通行無阻，功效何等偉大！這便是西洋物質文明的優點了！</p>
<p>寫至此，不覺使我記起了由抗戰而發生連帶關係的南北二橋，其一是河北宛平的廬溝橋，那兒　揭起了民族抗戰的序幕！其二是杭州的錢塘江大橋，這橋　建已久，而於近數年來方始興工；工程之鉅艱，費用之浩大，在我國可稱空前絕後！而這錢江人橋對於未來東南數省交通上的貢獻，其關係自然是非常重大的！民國廿六年方吿完成，不幸戰禍爆發！而慘淡經營，費時數年的偉大建築，竟毀於一旦！這眞是很可扼腕的！</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>近幾天來，不知道那裏來的一批蝦，大大小小的着實不少，價錢也小算怎樣貴，所以我們可以趁此吃些蝦了。吃蝦最簡單的方法，便是搶蝦，用好醬油浸透之後，拌些醬乳腐在內，下酒或佐粥，最爲相宜。要是講究衛生不喜半生不熟的東西，那麼來個油泡蝦如何？若講經濟，那就少不了輔佐品，如湖葱紅燒蝦，百葉絲紅燒蝦，蘿　絲紅燒蝦，蝦仁蛋之類，都很可口，還有一個煮法，是用香糟　同紅燒，蝦的鮮味，和香糟的香味，眞是相得益彰；幷且香糟也可以吃下去，若是丟掉不吃，未免暴殄天物了。</p>

<h3>吳佩孚將軍的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 殷紅</p>
<p>自從吳佩孚將軍逝世蓋棺　定後，大家都承認他是「東方文化之持產，中國歷史的完人」。吳將軍的能够受人這樣的崇敬和欽仰，當然是像申報社評所云「身陷重圍則砥礪節操，奸邪交逼猶忠貞自持，而威武不能屈，富貴不能淫」等可敬的許多史實有以致之。然而，同時在吳將軍平日的衣食住行四大生活　素中看來，他也是廉介持躬，節儉樸實的人物，其中很有許多地方足以爲我們表率的，姑已寫在後面。</p>
<p>吳佩孚將軍在昔民初之際，亦嘗叱咜風雲，喧赫一時。但是他雖身居顯職，無奈賦性剛毅，廉潔自守，與其部屬同甘苦，所以說到他的衣服方面，當在職時除了數襲必備的軍服外，西裝和華服件　也沒有的。迨後自民十五年間，由汀泗橋一役敗歸，從此善刀而藏，杜門謝客，不問世事，對於昔時所御的軍服，　說連上將制服在內，共十餘件之數，一併藏入箱籠，嗣後即改穿華服，沿用至今未變。但他的衣料全係國產所製，絕無一襲非國貨之物，即家中眷屬亦然如是，至於西服，則吳將軍終生並未穿過。</p>
<p>關於他的食物嗜好，倒可把「節食淡飯」來形容他。個性是歡喜辣味，幾乎每隻菜餚中都要加入，這大概是籍隸山東的緣故吧！而且他是最愛吃辣鱔魚」這東西的。原來所謂「辣鱔魚」，就是我們江浙人士所吃的「油汆鱔魚」而已，本來像我們視它是一種普通食物，可是在初把活鱔放人鍋中煮汆的時候，加上些辣椒，燒成後的味道確是够鮮美的。記得吳將軍曾有詩道：「盤中昂然若驕龍，沁人芳香辣花葱；，畢竟魏郞多異味，大快朶頣名士風」，就是詠他的「辣鱔魚」也。</p>
<p>吳將軍的故鄕山東蓬萊縣地方，有一所古式的居屋，那是在民國十三年間造成的。屋子還不見得怎樣都麗，祇是像中上階級人士的私宅差不多，因爲地位的有限，三進大小的宅院，常然談不到什麼亭臺樓閣了。自從民國十七年被擊敗後，曾一度入川，但不久即住在北平城，直到如今將近十一個年頭，終日閉門謝客，在狹隘的居室中樂度晚年。正因爲吳將軍生平廉潔的緣故，所以這北平的房屋，也並不是他建造的，據說是他的舊部某氏的故居；特地送給他的呢？</p>
<p>說到吳將軍的「行」，且來讀一下他的自輓聯：「得意時淸白乃心，不納妾，不積金錢，飲酒賦詩，猶是書生本色。失敗後倔强到底，不出洋，不走租界，灌園抱甕，眞個解甲歸田。從他的不出洋，不走租界」等看來，就可知道他是個很有氣節的人，他的行」，除了在以前叱咜風雲時曾經登過華中各地的名山大川外，其餘他從沒有「行」的興趣，自從一至北平，十一年來，足跡未越城外一步，終日在家飲酒賦詩作爲消遣而已。</p>

<h3>米棧中　底見濕爛米　路有凍死骨</h3>
<p>— 張鎮山</p>
<p>笨軍的運貨車，一連串的駛到那所鋼骨水泥凝結成的高大堆棧前。開車人伸出一隻手，大聲地對棧中人喊着：「五百包。」</p>
<p>「呵，來！」一羣苦力隨着這急促的應聲奔出棧門，粗壯的手，把一根布帶橫腰一束。</p>
<p>「來！」一聲，一個裝得　滿的蔴布袋就滑上肩頭，拖着一陣幽長而急促的，似呻吟，又似嘆氣的呌聲，飛快地走進那堆棧。第二個人，第三個人，以至第九，第十個人，都連接地忙碌着，週而復始的奔波，肩運。</p>
<p>我走進棧，同行的朋友和我介紹了一個管棧的朋友，他引導我們瀏覽着，我於是睜開眼睛望：一陣剌激從眼神經通過腦神經，似喜悅，又似憤恨！那一袋袋的米，整齊而有規律的堆着，從地面到屋頂，從門口到那陰暗的裏面，一疊疊地堆着。那麼龐大的棧屋，只在中間空出了一條　堂式的走道，週遭盡是米，白粉飛滲於空氣裏，迷漫開來，播陽着陣陣的米的香味。</p>
<p>走着，走着，我信步徜徉，走過一間小小的賬房的窗口，寫字檯上的電話，像發了狂似的，劇烈地響着。那位管棧的朋友，拿起聽筒：「喂！呵！三百包，知道了。」他放下聽筒，反轉身，吩咐一個工頭模樣的人說：「二老闆打電話來，又進了三百包，四點鐘送到。」那個工頭一陣「呵，呵！」代替着答話，眼睛接着就射在那米堆的空隙上。也許是在計劃堆放的位置吧？我心裏這樣暗忖。</p>
<p>這時候，電話鈴又瘋狂似的響起來，我也無心再去注意它，儘自走着，望着，心裏浮上一個很幼稚的疑問：「幾百包，幾百包，只進不出，這所堆棧也許會有脹坍的一天吧？這屋外面又不知道有沒有發現過餓斃的露屍？」</p>
<p>突然一陣冷氣，帶着一陣怪樣的氣味襲過來，我低頭凝視：那底層的蔴布袋是潮濕的，汚穢的。我又伸手一摸，手指的感覺尤如摸着了一條新鮮帶魚，我嘆息那腐爛了的米和袋，對那位朋友說：「這裏的米已經壞了吧？可惜！」</p>
<p>「這外棧還好，裏棧還要勿對哩！」他說着，引導我們走過一道鐵門，進入那陰森的，暗沉的「裏棧」。米，堆得比「外棧」更飽滿，我伸手摸摸蔴袋，每一疊的底層，至少有兩包已經濕爛了。我的神經被刺激得緊張起來，不允許我說客氣話，情不自禁地對那管棧的朋友這樣說：「米價已漲到四十多元了，與　囤在這裏濕爛，不如售出去。放鬆一點，那些難得一飽的窮人，就受惠不淺哩！」</p>
<p>「老闆不在乎此。他有的是錢！這棧中的米，差不多都賺了一倍，有的還是五月間囤的十八塊頭的貨色，壞掉一點，又有什麼關係？橫直又不會蝕本。」</p>
<p>「那麼他們要什麼價錢才會心滿意足，才肯脫手呢？」</p>
<p>「旣爲囤戶，就沒有心滿意足的一日，別人餓死，自然是別人的事，與囤戶無涉的。像我，管的是米，家裏却吃不起四十幾元一担的，還是以麵粉當飯，眞無從從說起。」說完話，他也是一陣搖頭嘆息。</p>
<p>我只有沉默地聽着，沉默地走着，沉默地嗅着那米堆的氣息！</p>
<p>走出門，買着一份夜報，打開來，一段消息的標題寫着：「新囤戶活躍，米價節節上昇。」再翻過來，另一段消息的標題寫着：「當局將抑平米價，對囤戶將籌議法律制裁。」我在歸途上，對那猛獸似的高棧回望，希翼它迅速死於獵人手下。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天榮</p>
<p>第十八回　談經濟繁榮與舊市　述婚姻掠奪溯遺風</p>
<p>朱愛人的這一番話，大家很以爲是。這時火車已過南翔，將近上海了。邵慧華有家在上海，她一到上海，自然先要到報館裏去一趟，報吿她所受命館方，擔承的職務。她一方面寫特稿，一方面選取所攝的照片，一方面把所蒐集的文件，可披露的披露，不必披露的，送交參玫部歸擋，自有人掌管。然後她回家去，和她的母親，以及弟弟妹妹等出去娛樂，今天恰巧是星期六了。吳君素，吳君可姊妹兩人，她們也有家庭在上海，而且她們還是大家庭制，一下火車，她們便到家裏去了。不過晚上，她要到余澹雲那裏去一趟，那是澹雲囑咐她的。或者疑心她是找她去做什麼女儐相吧。但近年中國結婚，往往不用什麼男女儐相的了。因爲結婚並非一種神秘的事，依着中國舊式的結婚，當新娘了的宛似一個活死人。話也不許說一句，笑也不許笑一笑，好端端自己可以走路的，偏要人扶着。而且結婚明明是喜事，新娘子偏要哀哀啼哭，這是什麼來由。不管天熱氣悶，把一大幅方　，沒頭沒腦的兜住，好像沒有臉面見人似的。當做新娘時，弄得痛不敢拊，癢不敢搔，這不是太不自由了嗎？從前有許多做新娘子的，因爲太守着那個舊風俗，過於矜持，而出了毛病的呢。有的爲了天熱，悶死在轎中。有的爲了失火坍屋，不敢逃避。到後來，結婚改了略簡便的法子，已覺得解放自由了。但是承着以前的餘風，新娘子還是像從前那般不言不笑，過於矜持。因此必定有儐相扶持她，伴同她，而新娘子到此要嬌羞不勝，雖然平日之間，是很倜儻，很灑落的。這些事，不免有些兒矯揉造作，近乎作僞。現代的中國，却不容許再有那些近乎作僞的事，所以結婚禮節中，男女儐相，大概都已廢止不用了。不但如此，有許多簡便的結婚，只要到本地方的婚姻局去登記一下就是了。請客不請客，原是隨你的便，難道請客的便算夫婦，不請客的便不算夫婦嗎？還有的婦女們手上戴着一隻結婚戒指，好像身有所屬。可是在十餘年前，在蘇俄早已瞧不起那種結婚戒指，他們說：男女間的愛情，豈在這些金屬物上呢？（二一三）</p>

<h3>President Kong Sends Letter of Condolence to Wu Jizhong</h3>
<p>Chongqing: President Kong sent a letter of condolence to Wu Peifu's son, Jizhong, on the 10th, stating: "Your father's merits are brilliant and shine in the universe. His respect for Confucius and defense of the Way were uniquely great. Unexpectedly, the disasters became more intense, and his sincerity became more evident. At a time when the enemy was rampaging, he strictly guarded against the barbarians. Despite all kinds of hardships, he maintained his integrity throughout, dedicating himself solely to the righteousness. I had hoped that he would uphold justice and reform the public. How could I have expected that a minor illness would suddenly take him away from this world? I am saddened by the collapse of the universe and deeply saddened by our thirty years of friendship. I am heartbroken by the loss of my virtuous hero. I believe that your father's ambition was to be a sage, and his actions were exemplary. Although his body has passed away, his spirit is still strong in China. His achievements are comparable to those of his predecessors, and he has lived up to what he learned. The National Government has clearly ordered commendations for his life and death. I hope that he can comfort his spirit in heaven and serve as a model for mankind. Continuing his legacy and fulfilling his ambitions is the greatest act of filial piety. I hope that you will restrain your grief and assist in the great cause." (10th dispatch)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>What Will the League of Nations Do?</h3>
<p>The League of Nations General Assembly is holding a meeting of member states in Geneva, Switzerland today, with the Finnish government's complaint about the Soviet Union's aggression against Finland as the main agenda item. According to predictions from London yesterday, the League of Nations General Assembly is likely to decide on the following four points regarding this case: 1. Condemn the Soviet Union's aggression; 2. Request that all countries not provide the Soviet Union with any assistance; 3. Request that all countries provide Finland with as much assistance as possible; 4. Request that the Soviet Union stop its aggression. Although this prediction should not be regarded as certain, the information revealed is tantamount to announcing to the world that there is nothing more to hope for beyond these four points. We have repeatedly stated our views on the Finland-Soviet Union issue, and we do not want to discuss it again. Regarding the League of Nations, please allow us to briefly express our thoughts during this General Assembly period, or when all parties are paying more attention.</p>
<p>The League of Nations was established after the First World War and was highly regarded for a time. The covenant it represented was particularly capable of maintaining international order and laying the foundation for world peace. In 1931, after the test of Japan's invasion of China, its weaknesses were fully exposed. The violent did as they pleased in actions that violated the alliance, and the strong were negligent in their duty to protect the law. As a result, the League of Nations was on its last breath, only preserving its form. Although it has made considerable contributions in health cooperation and technical matters, it is not the original purpose of organizing the League of Nations. This can prove the existence of the League of Nations, but it is not enough to explain the value of the League of Nations. Looking back on the experience of the League of Nations from beginning to end, those who regret, sigh, curse, and ridicule it each have their own reasons. Those who support, play with, despise, and destroy it also each have their own reasons. If a group of member organizations has such a disparity in the attitudes of its members towards the group, then it will eventually collapse, which is not unexpected.</p>
<p>In the past, we had the highest hopes for the League of Nations at first, and then we were deeply disappointed. Today, although we no longer have any extravagant hopes, we still earnestly hope that the world will not give up eating because of choking, regarding it as hopeless and discarding it like worn-out shoes. It is true that human beings live in groups, naturally evolving from spouses to families to tribes to states to countries, and no one can be outside of it. Furthermore, linking from countries is still a natural trend. Unexpected setbacks are inevitable, but the natural law has sufficient reason and great power to eventually complete and will never be abandoned due to unexpected setbacks. If the League of Nations has hidden causes for its unsound foundation, unreasonable defects in its organization, and unrealistic provisions in its alliance, and even the countries that preside over its affairs have serious suspicions of disloyalty, then its twenty years of history have not only failed to make good use of time to gradually make the unsound sound, the unreasonable reasonable, and the unrealistic realistic, in order to fulfill the mission that the League of Nations should have, but also have been in a step-by-step retreat in matters of deception. Who is really to blame for this? It is true to say that Britain and France were perfunctory, it is true to say that Japan and Germany were rebellious, and it is true to say that the United States stayed out of it, but the failure of the highest organization of mankind is better to say that mankind has not exhausted its efforts and done its best for this highest organization than to blame anyone. Those who destroy international order and world peace deliberately accumulate violence and commit violent acts. Those who love peace and admire order, in addition to using their brains and ink to develop the League of Nations Covenant, each paying membership fees, have they cultivated the slightest behavioral power for those who act for the League of Nations? It is bound to fail to use those with no power to restrain violence, and to use those who cannot act to restrain violent acts. How can one wait for failure before knowing this? In the past, China's appeals were repeatedly relied upon as such, and today Finland's appeals and the reported resolutions are like this, which can be said to be just right for the League of Nations, which has no power to act.</p>
<p>Since the League of Nations has no power to act, what is the point of the League of Nations for the world? Why is it still earnestly hoped today that the world will not discard the League of Nations? When China appealed to the League of Nations, China's intention was not to rely on the League of Nations, but to believe that the League of Nations should make a practical representation within the scope of what it could do. The facts showed that the representation was extremely bad. The right and wrong of the Sino-Japanese issue have been clear from the beginning, but the League of Nations still used investigation as a method to delay its judgment. Finally, the condemnation of Japan came after the delayed investigation, but it was not because of the investigation that Japan should be condemned. Whether the condemnation of Japan was helpful to China is a matter of debate, and those who are malicious even mock the Chinese government for delusional reliance. However, Finland does not know that the League of Nations is incapable of action, and does not know that empty words of condemnation of the Soviet Union are of no help to Finland's difficulties. Still, it followed in China's footsteps and did not hesitate to complain. What is the reason for this? The various countries clearly know that the League of Nations cannot do anything, but they still do not hesitate to open meetings. What is the reason for this? Is it not a counter-evidence that all countries, regardless of whether they have encountered aggression or not, do need an international supreme organization? Only with this need should we seek to adapt to this need. The way to adapt is definitely not to abandon the incapable League of Nations, but to enrich the League of Nations, so that the unsound will become sound, the unreasonable will become reasonable, and the unrealistic will become realistic, and finally be able to fulfill its mission. China's appeal has not yet been settled, and Finland's appeal has just begun. Even if the League of Nations cannot immediately take any effective action, it should learn from the tests of appeals and the lessons of facts, and take the opportunity of the meeting to thoroughly reform the League of Nations itself. For the countries of the world, since it cannot force the whole to take the scope of the League of Nations, it should also put forward some principles and unite those who faithfully follow it as one, removing clauses that cannot be implemented and members who do not follow it. For world disputes, since it cannot strictly enforce sanctions, it should also initiate arbitration so that the countries in the dispute have room to reconsider their attitude and have the opportunity to accept arbitration. There are few countries that are confident that they will be able to resolve disputes in war in countries that are in a state of war. If the League of Nations has an attempt to initiate it, even if it fails, it is not enough to criticize the League of Nations, which is on its last breath.</p>
<h3>British Admiralty Announces Large-Scale Mine Clearance; U.S. Counter-Sales to Britain Will Be Appropriate; German Economy Minister Says He Is Fearless</h3>
<p>London: The British Admiralty announced yesterday that in order to control navigation in designated areas within British territorial waters, the Admiralty plans to declare maritime law in order to conduct large-scale mine clearance of British coastal waters. Naval commanders in the Thames Estuary, Portsmouth Harbour, Firth of Forth, Orkney, and Shetland Islands have been ordered to manage navigation in accordance with the new regulations. (10th United Press dispatch)</p>
<p>London: According to reliable sources, as of now, as many as 40 German submarines have been sunk by British and French warships. It is generally said that Germany had about 60 submarines before the outbreak of the war. Although the country's shipyards have concentrated their efforts to speed up manufacturing, due to too many losses, there is still a shortage of supply. In addition, the work of adding submarines in the country is not as difficult as replenishing submarine officers and soldiers. (10th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>New York: Those with good connections in Washington say that if Britain allows Americans to purchase German goods and certain German items, such as optical instruments, that cannot be purchased elsewhere, the United States will be satisfied. If Britain can do this, the United States will ignore the British blockade. (9th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Munich: German Economy Minister Fink delivered a speech here yesterday, explaining the superiority of Germany's wartime economy, saying that the full effect of Germany's four-year plan must be evident recently. The huge factories that have been built are now beginning to produce, and most other factories are under construction or improvement. Even in wartime, all of our artificial products are more, better, and cheaper than usual, while Britain's export trade has been reduced by 40%. This is why Britain wants to blockade Germany's exports. The purpose of Britain's recent blockade policy is nothing more than to destroy the principles of free trade and maintain Britain's dominance. But Germany today has a way to resist. What we cannot obtain from overseas today can be obtained from Soviet Russia in large part. In addition to the feed agreement that has already been announced, the Soviet Union has also promised to supply Germany with a large amount of beryllium sand, kimberlite, cotton, wool, and kerosene. This item cargo, which will increase greatly in the future. During the First World War, Germany was surrounded by enemies on three sides. Today, the situation is different. The entire Europe, except for eastern France, and a part of vast Asia can be used by our country. Although Britain monopolizes the North Sea, Germany's trade with the markets of Central Europe and Southeastern Europe can continue without hindrance. (10th Haitong dispatch)</p>
<p>The Hague: The National Daily, run by German Air Force Minister Goering, published an article today stating that Germany will soon make its people bear greater financial sacrifices. The article quoted Hitler as saying, "What we have today is not worth considering. The only factor that determines the future is Germany's victory." The article continued, "Everyone in Germany must participate in this common destiny according to their ability, not according to their willingness. So far, the war has not required any sacrifices in the family, but everyone in the family must understand that the time when the entire meaning of the head of state's words will come is now approaching."

<h3>Anglo-French Economic Blockade Intensifies Pressure on Germany</h3>
<p>(London Air Mail) British Labour Party Deputy Chairman Greenwood recently published an article stating, in brief, that most people view this war as something imaginary, with no real possibility. The reason for this is that the general public believes that once the war breaks out, Britain and France will inevitably suffer large-scale air raids. German aircraft formations will circle over London and other vulnerable cities, dropping bombs. However, the reality is that on the morning of the declaration of war and in the days that followed, although air raid alerts were issued in certain places,</p>
<p>life was able to maintain a reasonable normality. People in uniform were everywhere, and scenes of war were visible, but German bombs did not rain down. News of the war was also unusually quiet, leading many to believe that the war had no "real" nature. In fact, the silence of war news was mostly due to the government's carefulness and the failure to handle intelligence matters perfectly. It should be known that although the progress of the war may not be entirely as expected, it is indeed in progress. This is well known to the British people. However, the people are neither afraid nor as overly excited as they were in the early days of the last European war, engaging in flag-waving, cheering, and frenzied parades. On the contrary, they only accept the provocation and fight to the end with a calm attitude. The entire nation is currently working urgently to address national affairs. Although there have been some missteps due to delayed preparations, the organization and utilization of national resources are progressing daily, which is a real situation. I recall that when the last European war broke out in August 1914, we were not adequately prepared in all aspects, and Belgium and France were invaded shortly afterward. This time, the situation is very different from the past. The Anglo-French Allied forces have already entered Germany, thereby stopping the enemy and preventing them from crossing the red line. No inch of land in Western Europe has been trampled by the enemy. Not only that, but the economic blockade policy implemented by Britain and France is putting increasing pressure on Germany. Hitler's situation is becoming increasingly difficult, unable to obtain the raw materials necessary for the war. The British Navy is gradually eliminating the threat of submarines in various oceans, and the method of warships escorting merchant convoys is becoming increasingly effective. Since the start of the war, the number of merchant ships sunk by German submarines has been decreasing daily. Although the losses suffered by Britain are regrettable, new ships are being launched one after another. The number of merchant ships owned by our country is actually more than it was at the start of the war. The supply of food and raw materials is steadily arriving, and the people have no fear of famine, as was the case during the last European war. (Havas)</p>
<h3>European War Zone: American Ships Halt Voyages; Totaling Eighty-Four Vessels</h3>
<p>Washington: The American Steamship Company previously applied to the Maritime Commission on the 7th of last month to transfer nine of the company's eleven transatlantic ships to Panamanian registration so that they could continue to operate between Europe and the Americas without being prohibited by neutrality laws. According to an announcement by the Maritime Commission, the American Steamship Company has withdrawn this application and intends to register with another undeclared country. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(New York Air Mail) Since the establishment of the new Neutrality Act, President Roosevelt has designated the European war zone, prohibiting American merchant ships from sailing there. As a result, eighty-four American ships have halted voyages, totaling 536,300 tons. Of the 326 American ships operating overseas, totaling 2,150,000 tons, the number of ships now halted accounts for approximately 35 percent, while the tonnage halted accounts for 24 percent. How this situation will affect Far Eastern trade is still unknown. President Roosevelt once said that these halted merchant ships could not be absorbed by Latin America or the Pacific, which has attracted much attention. Various shipping companies on the West Coast are planning to expand cargo operations in the Pacific. Furthermore, because Japan purchases almost all goods from the United States using its own ships, they are discussing various methods to request government assistance to force Japanese buyers to use American ships to transport a portion of the goods. However, because the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty will expire on January 25th of next year, the trade relationship between the two countries is quite unstable, so this issue is also very difficult to resolve.

<h3>The United States Strengthens Naval and Land Defenses; Building Large Warships and Vessels</h3>
<p>Washington: To adapt to the recent strengthening of the United States' Caribbean Sea defenses and to safeguard the Panama Canal and the American continent, President Roosevelt officially announced yesterday the Tenth Naval District, including Saint Croix and the Virgin Islands. Until today, Saint Croix was under the jurisdiction of the South Carolina Naval District. At the same time, the army is increasing land and air force strength in Puerto Rico, while the navy is building a major air base there. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Washington: Acting U.S. Secretary of the Navy Edison yesterday signed a contract worth five million U.S. dollars to build eleven high-speed motor torpedo boats and twelve submarine destroyers, modeled after the British small boat squadrons. The new torpedo boats and submarine destroyers will be used for neutrality patrols. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>Portuguese Ship Carrying Germans Captured by British; Totaling Twenty-Five</h3>
<p>Lisbon: The Portuguese ship "Arrango" was intercepted yesterday in Portuguese coastal waters by a British destroyer, which sent personnel on board to inspect various documents. It was discovered that the ship was carrying twenty-five German passengers, who were immediately taken into custody on the ship. It was determined that these individuals were sailors employed by various merchant ships in Panama, who had been dismissed due to the outbreak of the European war. They had first boarded the Italian mail ship "Saturnia" and arrived at the Portuguese Azores, and then transferred to the "Arrango" in preparation to come here, but were captured by the British destroyer en route. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Oslo: The Norwegian merchant ship Gimle (1,271 tons) exploded and sank off the east coast of England. The crew drifted at sea in lifeboats for three days before being rescued by another Norwegian ship and arrived at a certain port today. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Warns Neutral Countries</h3>
<p>Berlin: The "German Foreign Political News" recently published an article commenting on the attempts by the Allied countries of Britain and France to involve neutral countries in the war and use them to achieve their war aims. It stated, in brief, that before the outbreak of the war, the Allied countries devoted themselves to winning over neutral countries, and this has intensified after the war. They not only want them to fight Germany economically, but also want them to engage in real war. If a country willingly allows itself to be used by the Allied countries and listens to their promises, it is tantamount to digging its own grave. The Allied countries often use the maintenance of peace as a pretext for enticing people to conclude security pacts. Now they also realize that adopting this approach is no longer appropriate, so they have changed their approach and are engaging in inciting workers in various countries to carry out strikes. Romania can be taken as an example. Since the outbreak of the Soviet-Finnish conflict, the Allied countries have regarded it as the most favorable event and have begun to intensify the flames of war, instigating Finland to adopt a stubborn attitude. Allied politicians clearly want to drag neutral countries into the war. Poland is one example, and its role is nothing more than to make neutral countries their helpers in achieving the goal of winning glory for the Allied countries. Under such circumstances, neutral countries should urgently assess the benefits that this kind of democratic politics gives to mankind. It should be known that the Allied countries will do everything possible to disrupt the peace and order of areas that have not yet been involved in the war. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Studies European Situation</h3>
<p>Washington: President Roosevelt yesterday continued to study the confidential report on the European situation submitted by U.S. Ambassador to London Kennedy. The ambassador met with the president twice, and when he left Washington for Boston yesterday, he left a small box with the president. The ambassador plans to return to Washington in the middle of next week. At the same time, the State Department received a large number of suggestions supporting and opposing the severance of relations with the Soviet Union to protest the Soviet invasion of Finland. Republican Senator Vandenberg of Michigan sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull requesting the government to reconcile its attitude toward the Soviet Union with the policies of other countries in the Western Hemisphere, that is, to sever relations with the Soviet Union. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>Italian Youth Demonstrate Against Soviet Union; Military Police Intervene</h3>
<p>Rome: A thousand Italian students and Fascist youth groups again went to the Soviet Embassy yesterday, shouting slogans such as "Down with the Communist Party" and "Long Live Finland!" However, they were dispersed near the embassy by a thousand soldiers wearing steel helmets and carrying rifles and bayonets. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Policy Not Swayed by Other Countries</h3>
<p>Rome: The "Electrical News" reported that British newspapers, with headlines such as "Italian Anger" or "Italian Warning to the Soviet Union," are attempting to use Italian sympathy for Finland as the basis for an Italian anti-Soviet policy. We should immediately point out that British people harbor this hope without any basis. Italy's foreign policy is based on its own interests and will not be affected by foreign propaganda. Italy knows very well that certain countries, although praising morality, use pragmatism and power politics as principles when distributing spoils. "Electrical News" claimed that the Allied countries cannot incite Fascist Italy to take hostile action against the Soviet Union or destroy the German-Italian alliance. Italy understands that the purpose of foreign misinterpretations of Italian public opinion is to persuade Italy to join the Allied countries. (Haitong, 10th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Forces Approach Petsamo Port; Fierce Fighting Occurs at Kemijärvi; Finnish Forces Prepare to Counterattack in Three Directions</h3>
<p>Stockholm: According to news from Finland, Soviet troops have advanced to within fifteen kilometers of the port of Petsamo. Those advancing on the Lake Ladoga front have broken through Finnish lines near the town of Salmi. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Moscow: The Leningrad Military District issued the following recent war report: "On the Murmansk front, Soviet troops conducted operations on December 9th to destroy a Finnish resistance base 50 kilometers south of Petsamo. At the same time, the mine-clearing work at the Petsamo port berthing area has been completed. On the Ukhta-Repola-Porosozero and Petrozavodsk fronts, Soviet troops advanced 79 kilometers from the border area. After the Soviet army occupied the city of Suomussalmi, it continued to advance toward Kivela. In the Karelian Isthmus, Soviet troops are still advancing after breaking through the main Finnish position in the Taipaleenjoki River basin. Fierce fighting has occurred in the Kexholm area. (TASS, 10th)</p>
<p>Finnish Border: According to reliable news obtained here last night, Finnish forces are now preparing to counterattack Soviet troops in three directions. The counterattack will be launched on one front in the Karelian Isthmus, and on the other two fronts from the Finnish central line. It is reported that fierce fighting has now occurred on the Finnish central line. The Red Army in that area is unable to advance, while Finnish forces are counterattacking in the Koirajärvi and Suomussalmi areas, and have recaptured many villages and towns. It is said that in the vast swampy area at the junction of Koirajärvi and Suomussalmi, a small number of Finnish troops fiercely resisted throughout yesterday, preventing the Red Army from advancing. It is said that the Finnish army is adopting ingenious guerrilla tactics, attacking the Red Army from the forests from time to time. At the same time, according to unconfirmed reports, Finnish forces have cut off the Murmansk and Leningrad railways. In addition, 3,000 to 4,000 Swedish volunteers are now concentrated on the Swedish-Finnish border, preparing to enter Finland and assist Finnish forces in combat. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: The Finnish Defense Forces General Headquarters issued an official report last night, stating that "The enemy continues to attack the Taipale River and the Karelian Isthmus, but has been repelled by our forces. There has been no significant activity by the enemy navy. The enemy air force has bombed the villages of Laskaala and Vammelmansii, but the damage is minimal. Russian aircraft have also strafed civilians on the road in the village of Sustamo with machine guns. Three enemy aircraft have been shot down by our forces. In addition, the Finnish Air Force has also conducted reconnaissance and bombing of enemy trenches. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<p>London: A telegram has been received here from Finnish commander Meripel in Vyborg stating that extremely fierce fighting is currently taking place in the Karelian Isthmus area. The Soviet side is now deploying reinforcements to attack, but has not broken through the Mannerheim Line at any point. The fighting at Petsamo is quiet. It is reported that Soviet forces are currently trying to secure their lines of communication in that area. The exact number of deaths and injuries in the Helsinki air raids is now 65 dead and 160 injured. Finland has not been subjected to air raids since the third day after the start of the war. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Moscow: Soviet newspapers are extremely silent on the war today, only publishing vague communiqués. In the days following the outbreak of the war on the Soviet side, reporters specially assigned by Soviet newspapers were extremely active, but they have also stopped their reports since yesterday. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<p>Helsinki: After the Finnish army repeatedly repulsed Soviet troops along the entire line, especially in the Karelian area, morale here was greatly boosted. Because the Red Army originally had an overwhelming advantage in terms of troop strength and equipment, the fact that it has failed to achieve any success after several days of intensive attacks is enough to excite the Finns. As for the Soviet claim that the Red Army has landed in the port of Vyborg, it is purely a fabrication. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Three Goals of Soviet Advance</p>
<p>Helsinki: Soviet troops are fiercely attacking Finnish positions in three areas: the Karelian Isthmus, Lake Ladoga, and the Petsamo region. In the Karelian Isthmus, the snow has stopped and is also melting, which is quite convenient for the Soviet army. The Soviet army is focusing on the fighting north of Lake Ladoga, and yesterday occupied the area of Suomussalmi, 20 kilometers from the Soviet-Finnish border. The Soviet army is clearly attempting to destroy the railway network. Soviet reinforcements are heading to the area, which now has six infantry divisions and one armored car division. The Soviet army's first goal is to take Lexe, and it has already occupied most of the territory between Lexe and the Soviet-Finnish border. The Soviet army's second goal is to destroy the railway between Iisalmi and Nurmes. The third goal is to occupy Kitee, and then attack Salmi on the northeast shore of Lake Ladoga from there. The Soviet army is using heavy tanks to attack the Finnish army on that front. The Finnish Mannerheim Line is a formidable obstacle for the Soviet army. The Soviet Air Force will likely bomb the line after the weather improves. Petsamo is still held by the Finnish army, but the Soviet army was reinforced there yesterday. (Haitong, 9th)</p>
<p>Active Finnish Mobile Units</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to news here, several small squads of Finnish patrols have recaptured several miles of land in certain areas. In other areas, the Soviet pressure is quite strong. The flow of Soviet reinforcements to the front has now stopped. Several Soviet ships have left Petsamo. Soviet forces are currently advancing on the Karelian Isthmus, where Finnish forces are awaiting them in their main defenses. Most of the fighting currently consists of clashes between advancing Soviet troops and Finnish mobile units and hidden machine-gun nests. Attempts by Soviet forces to land on the coast have been thwarted. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Finnish Troops Fight on Ice Skates</p>
<p>Helsinki: According to news today, Finnish troops in white uniforms attacked Soviet troops today along a two-mile front in far northern Finland while wearing ice skates. The enemy was caught unprepared by the sudden attack, resulting in many casualties. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>Finnish Envoy to Soviet Union Arrives in Riga</h3>
<p>Riga: Finnish envoy to Moscow Koskinen, along with other embassy staff, arrived in Latvia yesterday. Koski immediately traveled to Germany via the capital. It is expected that Koski would arrive in Berlin early in the morning today. It is understood that the Finnish envoy to Russia and other staff originally planned to leave Russia earlier, but the Moscow authorities refused to issue passports until the Moscow diplomatic corps intervened. The Soviet Russian authorities then sent the passports. Upon arriving at the border, they were detained for another ten hours before being released. (Haitong, 10th)</p>
<h3>British Aid to Finns Resist; Supplying Finland with Aircraft</h3>
<p>London: Those in charge here claimed that the German wireless recently transmitted that the twenty fighter planes supplied by Britain to Finland were ordered from the United States so as not to hinder British relations with the Soviet government, etc. In fact, these aircraft were all supplied by British companies and were manufactured in Britain. Those in charge in Britain do not conceal British assistance to the Finns in resisting Soviet aggression for fear of a Soviet reaction. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Council Decides; Finland's Application Handed over to General Assembly for Processing; The Netherlands States It Will Not Participate in Sanctions; Latin American Countries Discuss Common Attitude</h3>
<p>Geneva: At the League of Nations Council meeting this afternoon, after Secretary-General Avenol read the correspondence between the League of Nations Secretariat and the Soviet and Finnish countries, the attending representatives exchanged preliminary opinions. The Finnish representative requested that the matter be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly immediately. After the Council adjourned, the Latin American countries gathered to consider their common attitude. It is widely believed that the Argentine representative strongly advocated expelling the Soviet Union from the League. The chairman of the League of Nations Council is currently Belgian representative Vieydt, while the Soviet Union has not sent a representative to attend. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Geneva: The League of Nations Council held a secret meeting this afternoon to discuss the Finnish issue. Finnish representative Holsti, the former foreign minister, was also present. The Council immediately decided to transfer the application submitted by Finland to the League of Nations General Assembly for processing. The General Assembly is scheduled to hold a meeting on the 11th of this month. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>London: Those in charge in Britain said that the agenda for the League of Nations General Assembly on Monday is roughly as follows: (1) Pass a resolution condemning Soviet aggression; (2) Ask countries not to provide aid to the Soviet Union; (3) Ask countries to provide as much aid to Finland as possible; (4) Ask the Soviet Union to stop the aggression. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>Geneva: Representatives of Latin American countries who are here to participate in the League of Nations General Assembly held an important meeting this afternoon to discuss the Finnish issue in order to determine a common attitude, and advocated electing Bolivian representative Costa du Riel as the chairman of the General Assembly. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>The Hague: At the current session of the League of Nations Council, there are as many as five seats for permanent and non-permanent council members whose terms are about to expire. It has been rumored that the Netherlands may be elected to a permanent seat, but according to officials here, the government of the Netherlands has decided not to accept it, considering that Belgium is already a council member and the Scandinavian countries have not yet been able to obtain a seat. As for the dispute between Finland and the Soviet Union, the government of the Netherlands, although sending personnel to attend the General Assembly this time in its capacity as a member state, believes that the League of Nations, with its current organization, does not have sufficient authority to take any action against aggressor countries. For this reason, although the country can join other member states in designating an aggressor country, it is absolutely unwilling to participate in any form of sanctions. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>London: The Daily Telegraph's correspondent in Geneva reported that the Argentine representative has issued a statement saying that if the League of Nations cannot declare the Soviet Union out of the League, the country will declare its withdrawal from the League. The country's representative is currently in Geneva wooing representatives of other Latin American countries in order to form a united front and unanimously demand that the League of Nations make a decisive decision. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<p>Rome: According to Istanbul news, Turkish political figures have made many comments on the League of Nations General Assembly, all believing that the League of Nations meeting is difficult to achieve practical results, because only Britain and France are the great powers participating in the League of Nations, which shows that the League of Nations is an unimportant organization. (Haitong, 9th)</p>
<p>Geneva: According to diplomatic sources, it is virtually certain that the League of Nations will condemn the Soviet Union in spirit. As for whether to declare it out of the League, it is not yet certain. What can be asserted now is that it is difficult to implement economic and financial sanctions against the Soviet Union. However, it is likely that a resolution will be passed inviting countries to provide as much assistance to Finland as possible. In this way, countries that have already decided to provide assistance can legally obtain a basis. As of now, Italy has shipped 80 aircraft to Finland, and Britain has supplied the country with 30 aircraft and 60,000 gas masks. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Geneva: Koo Vi-kyuin and Quo Tai-chi arrived here together last night. Early this morning, Koo first visited Soviet representative Stolitz of the Fourth Committee, and then met with representatives of Britain and France to exchange views on the council election issue. Koo may have also explained China's attitude in the General Assembly and the Council. The silence of the British representative this time was quite unexpected. Therefore, the opinion of the League of Nations members regarding the expulsion of the Soviet Union has changed somewhat. The British representative also refused to issue any statements or comments to journalists. According to semi-official observations, Britain seems to approve of censuring the Soviet Union and providing practical economic and financial assistance to Finland. Britain seems to oppose the expulsion of the Soviet Union. A secret meeting of the Council was held this morning, which only discussed procedural issues and will be held again this afternoon to discuss the Soviet-Finnish conflict. (9th)</p>
<h3>Sweden Decides to Maintain Peace</h3>
<p>Stockholm: Defense Minister Nilsson recently delivered a speech, stating in brief, "Sweden is determined to do everything possible to maintain peace. However, this is not something we can decide alone. Order, justice, social progress, and national freedom are all values of life and must be maintained. If others want to deprive us of them, we have no choice but to rise up and defend ourselves. All the military measures our country has taken recently are purely for the purpose of maintaining neutrality. For example, when a fire breaks out in a neighbor's house, everyone knows to take precautionary measures, which is only a matter of reason. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Stockholm: Lieutenant General Tonney, the Chief of the General Staff, has recently been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the entire country. He immediately issued a letter to the soldiers of the entire country, stating in brief, "Under the current circumstances, our urgent task is to defend the country's freedom and rights. Whether the country is safe or not depends on the determination and belief of the people. It is hoped that the soldiers of the entire country will be able to fulfill their duties so that the country can be placed on the safety of a rock." (Havas, 10th)</p>

<h3>Great Britain, France, Soviet Union and Other Countries Continue to Aid China - Hu Shih Speaks in New York</h3>
<p>New York - Chinese Ambassador to the United States Hu Shih gave a speech yesterday at a luncheon of the Foreign Policy Association, stating that China firmly believes that the Soviet Union, Great Britain, France, and other countries will continue to aid China in resisting Japan. Although the Soviet Union plans to sign a new trade agreement with Japan, Soviet aid to China will continue. "To this day, the Soviet Union has not indicated that it will abandon its policy of aiding China." Great Britain and France have only reduced a small portion of their troops stationed in North China, and they may make "other small concessions" to Japan within possible limits. He stated, "But we firmly believe that Great Britain and France will continue to allow China to transport munitions through French Indochina and British Burma. When China fights for survival and independence, Great Britain and France will not betray or abandon China. If democratic countries betray China halfway, it will forcefully overturn their so-called war aims and peace aims." Japan "decided to crush the National Government before it achieves stability and strength," so it began war against China. The isolationist policies of the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the United States allowed Japan to act freely in China. However, China's resistance has achieved the "good result of startling the Soviet Union, Great Britain, and the United States," who were sleeping comfortably. (United Press, 10th)</p>
<h3>US Republican Party Advocates Severing Relations with the Soviet Union - Vandenberg Sends Letter to Hull</h3>
<p>Washington - Republican Senator Vandenberg, a candidate for the party in next year's election, recently sent a letter to Secretary of State Hull, demanding the severance of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. He said that the countries of South America are extremely indignant at the Soviet invasion of Finland. Some countries have even demanded that the League of Nations declare the Soviet Union out of the League. The timely severance of diplomatic relations between the United States and the Soviet Union is a good opportunity to demonstrate Pan-American solidarity. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>French Government Confiscates Communist Party Property</h3>

(Sea Transport Telegram, 10th)</p>
<p>Geneva - After severely cracking down on communist propaganda, the French government found that the Communist Party has not ceased its activities. Because Communist Party organizations and newspapers have been closed down by the secret police, they have switched to using slogans and leaflets to continue propaganda in various provinces.

<p>Moscow - The Soviet icebreaker "Sedov" has been trapped in Arctic ice floes for more than two years. According to the Soviet Arctic Navigation Committee, the ship is currently drifting towards navigable waters. It is reported that the "Sedov" recently sent a radio message reporting its location at 83.27 degrees north latitude and 5.37 degrees east longitude. The crew is safe. The Soviet government has decided to send the largest icebreaker, the "Stalin," to rescue the "Sedov." The Arctic auxiliary ship "Maudanaz," currently docked in the Greenland Sea, has also been ordered to assist. (Sea Transport Telegram, 10th)</p>

<h3>Rumor that Turkish Government Demands Recall of German Ambassador</h3>
<p>Danjing - The political newspaper correspondent stationed in Berlin recently telegraphed that the Turkish government has reportedly requested Germany to recall its ambassador to Turkey, Papen. The ambassador returned to Turkey on the 7th of this month to report on everything. According to reports, the German Embassy in Turkey recently published a booklet that criticized the host country in many ways. Ambassador Papen is dissatisfied with the Berlin government, likely for this reason. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<h3>The United States Joins with Central and South America in Strategy to Combat International Propaganda - Fear of German-Italian Expansion after the Outbreak of the Second European War</h3>
<p>Propaganda, a new term that emerged from the First European War. It is still remembered that a Japanese military attache stationed in a certain country at the time received a telegram from the government ordering him to quickly investigate and reply with an explanation of this term. Readers who pay attention to diplomatic anecdotes may still recall this. Furthermore, in the first few years after its discovery, there was no definite assessment of whether international propaganda was good or bad. Our Chinese literati refer to the act of praising others' good deeds as "flaunting." Although propaganda is similar to flaunting, its scope is not limited to individuals, and its effect is not limited to praising good deeds. The meaning of propaganda is broader and not entirely the same as flaunting. Today, the cry for "total war" (literally translated as "total war") is widespread everywhere. The propaganda strategy, which was regarded as an unsurpassed treasure by the belligerent countries twenty years ago, has become old and outdated. However, North and South America, which are concerned about being implicated in the war, are enriching large-scale investigation organizations, relying on industrial efforts to prevent "sabotage," and using commercial means to prevent "espionage," and rising up to counter propaganda. Under the guidance of US Attorney General Murphy, the New York Federal Bureau of Investigation has branches in all forty-eight states of the United States, as well as overseas territories and possessions, from Alaska in the north to Puerto Rico in Central America and Cuba in the south, and from the Panama Canal Zone on the east coast of the Pacific to Honolulu and the Philippines in the center of the Pacific, all of which have stationed officials to exchange information. On the surface, the foreign secret combinations that these people guard against seem to be aimed solely at dictatorships and communism, but in reality, they strictly prevent all propaganda against the United States by strong Eastern and Western powers, as well as other neutral countries. Even cultural propaganda and scenic tourism propaganda are not immune to suspicion and surveillance. The two main things they are most committed to preventing are: Firstly, the lectures given by educators in class, which affect the future of a country through subtle and profound influences. Everyone should have a clear declaration as to whether anyone within the country is using education to secretly promote other countries, so as to establish a guarantee for the security of the country. Secondly, aircraft factories in the western United States are important for national defense and should not be allowed to harbor hidden dangers. Recently, it has been heard that the investigative agencies have been thoroughly screening the family history and experience of aircraft factory personnel to prevent spies from mixing in. A further step in their preventive measures is to expose the two main objectives of a certain dictatorship's propaganda against the United States: one is to secretly plot to change the existing political system of the United States, and the other is to induce useful money to leak out and go astray for other purposes. Therefore, the most urgent task of the "Pan-American Conference" held in the capital of Panama in September and October of this year was to expand the defense line of "countering foreign propaganda" and form a unified joint defense of North, Central, and South America. The main points are no more than four: Firstly, urge the countries of Central and South America to continue to work hard to eliminate foreign shares in the aviation industry and withdraw foreign agency personnel in order to contain the threat of war. Secondly, in view of the excessive length of the coastline in Central and South America, do not allow submarines of certain countries to secretly establish bases there, and especially do not allow a small number of foolish people to secretly store fuel and other materials along the coast to supply foreign submarines in order to strengthen the inner walls. Thirdly, do not allow Europeans to suddenly rise up to instigate riots in Central and South America, where people from all five directions live together, so as not to be driven by foreign soldiers. Fourthly, if those who incite riots have no chance to take advantage of, then the "differentiation" movement, which is a more moderate approach, is also on the list of precautions. All of these four points are sufficient to show the eagerness to avoid chaos and the depth of concern of the American government and people. At the same time, they also show the common psychology of Americans fearing the gradual westward expansion of German power. The ancient gentleman had the admonition of preparing without ceasing. Americans can be worthy of it without shame.</p>

<h3>Random Notes on an Eastern Journey (First Letter)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>A Few Words</p>
<p>In November of the 28th year of the Republic of China, this reporter departed from Guilin, with Ningbo as the destination, planning to travel across the hinterland of the four provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Zhejiang.</p>
<p>Although the Sino-Japanese war is currently accelerating towards total war, there are still three main battlefields in North China, Central China, and South China. Based on current trends, it is speculated that the battles on the North China and South China battlefields are still limited to "covering" and "containing." The decisive battle will still originate in the central battlefield north and south of the Yangtze River. Taking Germany in the First World War as an example of the victory or defeat of modern warfare, without a substantial and sound rear, the victory of the front line is also in vain. The purpose of traveling in the hinterland of the four provinces is to inspect the various phenomena in the rear of the central battlefield south of the Yangtze River and reproduce them in writing before the readers, hoping that they can be comforting, correctable, cautionary, or evaluative. If it is desired to use this as a divination tool to seek victory and national construction, then I am afraid that it is beyond the ability of this reporter's observations and writing skills.</p>
<p>This article is written and sent along the way. The selection of themes is quite complex, and the structure of the text is even more difficult to achieve in a systematic way. Therefore, it is titled "Random Notes." Zhang Changren, traveling in Ji'an, Jiangxi—</p>
<p>1.  In the Xiang-Gui Train</p>
<p>At half past six on the night of November 12th, this reporter took an express train from Guilin South Station heading north. The blue steel train, which had traveled south from Beijing-Shanghai, Tianjin-Pukou, Longhai, Ping-Han, and Yue-Han, still maintained its inherent beauty and comfort. It was one month after the great victory of the Battle of Northern Hunan. The military and civilians in the great rear of the Southwest were all optimistic about the current war situation with boiling emotions. After the train started, the passengers began to exchange conversations, using various different interpretations to prove the inevitability of victory in the war of resistance. The calm emotions made people feel as if they were on the night express train in Beijing and Shanghai that year.</p>
<p>Among the fellow travelers was Staff Officer Sun of the ____ Army, who talked about the future of the war from a military perspective, with quite unique insights. The conclusion of the talk was that the hard struggle of the whole country for the past two and a half years had yielded results. However, the closer victory is, the more difficult the battle will be. The so-called "he who walks a hundred miles is halfway at ninety," and one basketful of earth is truly enough to serve as a warning and encouragement to the people of the country today as they grasp the threads of victory and move forward towards a bright future. It was not until late at night that everyone went to bed.</p>
<p>The Xiang-Gui Railway, which will soon be open to traffic on the Guilin-Liuzhou section, has gradually normalized the train services on the Hengyang-Guilin section. The 360 kilometers between Guilin and Liuzhou used to take 18 hours to complete the entire journey, and there were still occasional delays. Now, only 12 hours are needed. This line was built by pooling the talents, materials, and resources of railways from all over the country and expending the sweat and blood labor of hundreds of thousands of civilians in Hunan and Guangxi. In the year since it opened to traffic, it has made its greatest efforts to contribute to the cause of national construction and will soon exert its great potential in the national defense of the Southwest.</p>
<p>2.  Hengyang in Expansion</p>
<p>Since the great fire in Changsha and the interruption of the "Zhe-Gan" Railway, Hengyang has leaped to become the transportation hub of the five provinces of Hunan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. In terms of railways, the Yue-Han Railway can reach Lukou in the north and Youjiang in the south, and the Xiang-Gui Railway can reach Liuzhou. In terms of highways, the Xiang-Qian, Xiang-Gui, Xiang-Yue, Xiang-Gan, and Heng(yang)-Xiang(tan) lines all radiate from here. In terms of waterways, it can be traced north along the Xiang River to Tongtan River and south downstream to Changsha and Xiangyin. The convenience of water and land transportation not only forms a major stronghold in military terms but also gradually becomes the center of Hunan's politics and economy. Hengyang can be proud of this.</p>
<p>However, Hengyang has thus become one of the main bombing targets of the Japanese Air Force in Central China. The city has been turned into ruins, and the nearby villages are also suffering from time to time. However, Hengyang has never surrendered and is actively expanding towards the suburbs to confront Japanese aerial violence in a stronger and larger posture.</p>
<p>Six months ago, this reporter had counted the houses in this area, but now they are gradually new and must be looked at with new eyes. The scorched earth in the city has gradually been covered by newly built houses. A large hotel that can accommodate hundreds of people is also under construction with temple capital. The city's defenses are being dismantled, and the streets are being actively widened. Outside the city, unnamed avenues are radiating towards the suburbs. New houses are neatly dotted on the red soil plains, and their structures are simpler and more practical than the old houses. New markets are also increasing on both sides of the road. Most of the shopkeepers come from the occupied areas and have reversed the national habit of "being content to live in one's native land" and become philosophers of "being content wherever one is." However, they are by no means "so happy here that they forget Shu." They avidly read newspapers, eagerly discuss the current situation, and are ready to advance with the victorious battle at any time. The Dagang Daily and the Zhengzhong Daily are published earlier than in other cities and can be bought after 7:00 a.m. In addition, there is also a theater showing old domestic films.</p>
<p>The Hunan Provincial Government stipulates that every day from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. is "air defense time" (except for rain and snow). The city gates and passes are monitored by the garrison, and all soldiers and civilians are "allowed to go out but not allowed to enter." Therefore, there is no market during the day, and the residents also move to the nearby villages in droves. As a result, the teahouses and restaurants outside the city are often full of guests. However, although the casualties from air raids can be expected to decrease as a result, the time that residents spend regularly is inevitably too much. It is heard that "how to use air defense time" is now a topic for some people in Hengyang, and they are eager for the provincial government to have a way to teach them.</p>
<p>3.  Overnight Stay in Chaling</p>
<p>There used to be shuttle buses connecting Hengyang and Ji'an, Jiangxi, but recently, due to the priority supply of transportation and materials for military use, one bus is now dispatched from Laiyang every day to facilitate travel between the two provinces. Passengers traveling from the Southwest to the Southeast provinces can take a train from Hengyang on the Yue-Han Railway to Laiyang, transfer to a highway bus to Jiehua on the border of Hunan and Jiangxi (fare 8 yuan and 7 jiao), and transfer to a Jiangxi Highway Administration bus to Ji'an (156 kilometers, fare 8 yuan and 6 jiao). However, the demand far exceeds the supply, and it is difficult to purchase tickets. Fortunately, the highway administrations of the two provinces handle passenger registration conscientiously. Registered passengers can definitely get on the road in at most two days.</p>
<p>Because this reporter had the convenience of a ____ Department vehicle driving to Jiangxi, he left Hengyang at 10:00 a.m. on the 17th, arrived in Laiyang at 1:00 p.m., and at this point diverged from the Xiang-Yue Highway. Crossing the Lai River eastward through Anren County, he arrived in Chaling at 5:00 p.m. Along the way, many coal mountains were seen, and coal seams were exposed on the ground everywhere. The local people are extracting it using indigenous methods, and those who carry it into the market on their shoulders are on the road. If it can be actively guided and assisted, and scientific methods can be used for excavation, and light rails can be laid to facilitate transportation, the fuel problems in the cities of southern Hunan and northern Guangdong may be completely solved.</p>
<p>Chaling is one of the remote counties in southern Hunan, and in reality, it is only a relatively large town. Because it is located in the center of the Xiang-Gan Highway, vehicles coming from the east and going to the west must stay overnight here. Therefore, the hotel industry is exceptionally developed. The hotels and restaurants near the bus station are lined up and are still relatively cheap. The streets are right-angled, and they have not been ravaged by Japanese aircraft. The people's lives seem to be very peaceful.</p>
<p>4.  A Glimpse of Lianhua</p>
<p>At dawn on the 18th, we set off east from Chaling and passed Jiehualong at around 9:00 a.m. Several military police were stationed here to check passing vehicles and soldiers and civilians. This lonely small village is also becoming more prosperous due to the passengers waiting for buses here. After this, we entered the territory of Lianhua County in Jiangxi Province.</p>
<p>The highways in Jiangxi Province are slightly narrower than those in Hunan Province and are less repaired. The road surface is damaged and uneven. This line was a military road during the past civil war. Where culverts should be used, small wooden bridges are mostly used instead. They have not been rebuilt for several years, and damage can be seen from time to time. If the driver is slightly careless or drives at night, there is a risk of accidents. For the sake of facilitating military transportation, the Jiangxi Provincial Highway Administration needs to repair or rebuild it immediately.</p>
<p>Lianhua used to be one of the Red Army's base areas. It is said that all parts of the county were once battlefields. Now, times have changed, and it is difficult to recover the traces of the past. The bunkers on the mountain passes have begun to be demolished. The bricks and stones, which were taken from the people in the past, have now been returned to the people for building houses and filling roads. The working farmers are mostly happy to carry them, thinking they can be used to build houses and fill roads. One of the city walls of Lianhua was completely leveled by mobilizing the entire county's population from October 1st to 15th. The houses in the cities and villages have whitewashed walls and black roofs, and they are tall and solid, like those of prominent families, which can be called the characteristic of Lianhua. Bamboo fences and thatched huts are only occasionally seen. However, the lives of the farmers are still very poor.</p>
<p>When the bus stopped near the bus station, an old man bowed on the side of the road, speaking with a northern Anhui accent, and invited us to dine at the "Refugee Hotel of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangxi," which was jointly opened by refugees from the four provinces. This reporter and Mr. Chen had a meal together, which included fresh mushrooms, fried bamboo shoots, sliced meat with cabbage, scrambled eggs with scallions, braised tofu, egg soup, and rice, and it only cost 6 jiao and 6 fen. This area is a rice-producing area in Jiangxi Province, and rice is sold for 6 yuan per dan, and eggs are 40 per yuan. It can be seen that although the cost of living in cities has continued to rise in the 30 months of China's war of resistance, most cities and villages, except for daily necessities, can still maintain a normal state. However, due to transportation reasons, only one and a half catties of edible salt can be purchased per yuan. At 3:00 p.m., we passed Anfu County, where most of the civilians were working hard to demolish the city walls. One hour later, we arrived in Ji'an, an important town in central Jiangxi. (Ji'an, November 20th)</p>
<h3>Huang Dawei Leads Bandits to Disturb the Fujian Border, Heading Towards Zhanglin and Huanggang to Spy on the Zhao'an Watershed</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Huang Dawei, who calls himself the "First Group Army of the National Construction Pacification Army," with approximately 2,000 men under his command, has occupied Chao'an, Anbu, and Chenghai, and actually uses "Peace to Save the Country" as a slogan to deceive the ignorant people of Chaozhou and Shantou. The Japanese army arrests young people in Chaozhou and Shantou, transports them to Nanao and Xiamen for training, and then forcibly sends them to various battlefields. However, young people arrested from other places are slightly trained and then transported to Shantou to be taken in and replenished by Huang. The so-called puppet pacification army is actually made up of scattered soldiers, hooligans, and bandits. Whenever young people with a slight sense of national identity are sent out to guard posts, they take the opportunity to escape with their guns or defect to the Chinese army. As for the puppet army stationed in Chenghai, they are closely monitored by the Japanese, and their military discipline is also extremely bad. On the evening of the 27th, the puppet unit crossed the Lianyangcheng River and immediately carried out arson in the three societies of Su Nan district, upper, middle and lower. The Chinese army's Li Shaoru Hong Zhizheng and other units recently retreated towards Zhanglin, Longdu, Lianhuashan, Fushan, Tangxiqiao, Raoping territory. The puppet army took the opportunity to invade, and the strong men of Nanyang's upper, middle and lower three societies immediately rose up to fight. At that time, three Japanese planes flew out of Nanao to assist in the battle, and four Japanese warships approached Zhalin Bay, Huanggang, Haishan, Jingzhou, and Yanzao to spy, firing cannons to assist in the attack and prevent the Chinese army from retreating back to the coastal villages and towns. The mountains and ridges of the counties along the Fujian-Guangdong border, such as Raoping, Zhao'an, Pinghe, Yongding, and Dapu, are high and steep, forming a natural boundary between the two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong. The Fenshui Pass in Zhao'an and the Songbai Pass in Pinghe are both land routes for the transportation of goods between the two provinces. After the sea routes were blocked, land transportation was fortunately still smooth. Many of the local people went abroad to make a living, while those who stayed in the mainland made a living by fishing and farming. Since the war of resistance, those who lived by fishing and salt have been greatly affected. Fortunately, the agricultural products have been abundant, and the government has paid attention to adjusting food and grains and dredging overseas remittances. Therefore, the social situation and the people's lives are still very stable. Last month, Huang Dawei secretly sent traitors into the Fujian-Guangdong border area to probe the movements of the Chinese army and the collection and transportation of materials. The authorities received secret reports from various districts and villages and had long anticipated that Huang would disturb southern Fujian. Yongding, Pinghe, Zhao'an, Raoping, Huanggang and other places have also often found absurd propaganda items. On the afternoon of the 28th, the 7th Army of Huang's puppet army that entered Lianyang was defeated by the militia and retreated back to Chenghai City. However, the puppet 1st Army mixed with Japanese infantry, artillery and cavalry, occupied Zhanglin, and there were also 20 motorboats that suddenly broke into the Donglong River from the north and south ports and ditches. The Chinese army there retreated to Tongcheng, Raoping, overnight. The women and children had already moved away. The highway from Zhanglin to Huanggang was thoroughly destroyed by the Chinese army and could not be used. The Japanese navy used motorboats instead of vehicles to supply Huang's puppet 1st Army for its eastward advance. Yanzao, Pinzhou, and Haishan were landed on by Japanese army battle teams on the 29th. Huang's puppet troops then advanced to Gushaobridge, 12 li from Huanggang. However, this bridge had been destroyed in advance. Hong Zhizheng and Huang Shaochu led the militia to retreat to the Jiuxi Bridge and the Centipede Mountain Range, launching a flank attack. The mountain range and the highway run parallel to each other, extending east from Zhanglin to Jiuxi Bridge, a distance of 20 li. There are no trees on the mountain, only yellow mud and granite. On the 29th, fierce fighting took place between the two armies in this section. Japanese aircraft from Nanao, commanded by Suzuki, took turns dropping dozens of bombs on Jiuxi Bridge and Centipede Mountain. The Chinese forces were forced to retreat, turning to hold the Qian Dongwei and the highway to Tangxi to protect Raoping City. On the morning of the 30th, Huang's puppet 1st Army occupied Huanggang, leading 500 Japanese soldiers, attacking Shencun, Zhelin, (a salt-producing area), and the Fenshui Pass on the border of Zhao'an. From Huanggang to Fenshuling, it is about 18 li, and the ridge is 20 li from Zhao'an City. The road is a low-lying plain area with no defenses to hold. There is a mountain five li outside Zhao'an City, and there is an airfield under the mountain. Now, the Chinese army is holding the Dushan Mountain at the border between Fenshuling and Zhelin. Japanese warships can be seen on the sea from the mountain. The mountain ridge is slightly steep, with strange rocks. It has been occupied by the sea bandit Yang Lu and his men for many years. Huang's puppet army is now divided into nine teams, totaling about 2,000 men. There are also 600 Japanese soldiers. Along the coast, in the occupied villages, there are hundreds of Japanese marines in each place. It is heard that the Japanese and puppet troops' invasion of southern Fujian this time is advancing eastward along the first trunk line of the provincial road. The purpose of the attack is to expand the area and obtain food supplies, which is of great political and economic significance. Huang Dawei's external propaganda aims to establish a puppet Fujian provincial autonomy and protect the ancestral graves of overseas Chinese.</p>
<h3>Beiping Muslims Clash with Japanese</h3>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: The Beiping Islamic General Association, sponsored by the Japanese, and its affiliated Islamic Youth Corps, recently had a dispute with the Tianqiao Theater while watching a play. The Japanese instructor mishandled the situation, and more than 600 Beiping Muslims went to the association to protest. The Japanese actually telegraphed the military police to suppress them with force. Before the military police arrived, six Japanese men, seeing the Muslims' fierce momentum, fled one after another. The Muslims then disbanded the Youth Corps, and the Islamic Association also went on a general strike. After much explanation by the Beiping Special Affairs Agency of Japan, it was ineffective. The Japanese Islamic movement suffered a great blow as a result of this case.</p>
<h3>Military Suppression of Bandits in Fujian to End Soon; Zhang Xiongnan's Forces Scattered; Meizhou Island Recaptured for the Third Time</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: After Zhang Xiongnan, the former third Brigade Commander of the Provincial Security Corps, rebelled, he immediately communicated with a certain party and accepted a false order from Huang Dawei of Shantou. He led more than 3,000 troops and entrenched himself in the border areas of Yongchun, Dehua, Xianyou, Datian, Yongtai, and other counties, enticing young men to join, extorting huge sums from local areas, and trying to expand his strength to disrupt the Fujian situation. The authorities appointed Huang Zhenwu, Director of the Security Department, as the Chief Commander for the suppression of bandits in central Fujian, and Wang Menggu, Administrative Inspector of the Fourth District, as the Deputy Commander. They dispatched a large army and divided it into several routes to suppress the bandits, recovering the bandit areas one after another. The bewitched young men also turned against the bandits one after another. The bandit forces were becoming increasingly desperate. In mid-November, the main force of the bandit troops, numbering more than 1,000, fled to Tuyunqi, the most solid fortress on Daiyun Mountain, the most dangerous mountain at the junction of Yongchun and Dehua counties, and resisted stubbornly. They also sent teams to guard the mountain paths around the mountain. The bandit suppression troops dispatched teams to search and advance along several routes. After three days and nights of contact, they finally reached the outer perimeter of Tuyunqi mountain stronghold. Zhang Xiongnan and Zhou Guanghui (the false Chief of Staff) then led more than 400 people and fled to the border between Dehua and Xianyou via the secret path between Shitiyan and Shuifuyan. Zhang Chengfu and Lei Zhenhua, two false Brigade Commanders, still led more than 400 people and stubbornly defended the stronghold. The stronghold was surrounded by cliffs and steep walls, making it extremely difficult to attack. The bandit suppression troops launched fierce attacks from all sides, and on the 21st, they finally broke through the stronghold. Zhang Chengfu and Lei Zhenhua each led more than 100 remnants and fled to Yingkeng and Guiyang in Dehua. It is estimated that more than 100 bandits were killed and more than 70 guns were seized. Now that the bandit nest has been broken through and the main force has been defeated, teams are being sent to pursue and suppress the remnants, and they will be wiped out in a few days. Large and small islands along the coast of eastern Fujian, such as Pingtan, Nanri, Meizhou, Dongsha, Nangan, and Chuanshi, have been successively occupied by pirates as bases for invading coastal counties such as Fuqing, Putian, Lianjiang, and Changle. Pingtan was once recovered in September, but then fell again. Meizhou has been recovered twice, but both times it was seized by pirates taking advantage of the opportunity. On the night of November 22, a certain elite unit crossed the sea from a certain place in Putian and landed on the western corner of Meizhou. They first killed the pirate sentries and went straight to the Mazu Temple, the headquarters of the pirate puppet command. The pirates woke up from their dreams, caught off guard, and 70 people were killed. The pirate leader Huang Yushu was also killed on the spot, and his head was sent to the county town of Putian for public display. To prevent the pirates from making a comeback, the troops are organizing the masses on the island, reorganizing the Baojia system, and building defensive fortifications. Yu A'huang, the pirate leader entrenched in Pingtan, has recently extorted money from the nearby small islands of Jiangyin and Tangyu, ranging from more than 10,000 yuan to several tens of thousands of yuan, demanding that it be paid within ten days, otherwise, he will plunder them. The fishermen of these islands have always had strong self-defense capabilities, and they are extremely angry upon hearing the news and are actively preparing to resist.</p>
<h3>War News from Southern Shandong and Jiaodong: Japanese Troops in Tai'an Pressure the Battle</h3>
<p>Japanese troops in Shandong Province have recently been constantly harassing the Chinese army's positions, but there have been no large-scale fierce battles. The following is a record: (1) More than 500 Japanese troops gathered in Zaozhuang, passed through Teng County, and arrived in Taierzhuang. On the 10th, they encountered the Chinese army in a fierce battle for several hours in front of Zhaishan, 30 li southwest of Taierzhuang. The Japanese army was defeated and retreated to its original location. (2) A part of the Japanese troops in Rizhao harassed Tao Luo on the 11th. After being intercepted by the Chinese army, the Japanese army's retreat was cut off, and they fled back to the city. (3) More than 150 Japanese troops in Jiaodong invaded Laiyang to the east. On the 10th, they met with the Japanese troops invading the south of Gaomi County in Nanshu. On the 11th, they advanced to Shuigoutou in the southeast of Laiyang. On the same day, the Japanese troops in Jimo also invaded the north on various routes, and they are all in a standoff with the Chinese army.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops stationed in Dawenkou are mixed with White Russians, who specialize in reconnaissance work. If they encounter soldiers in various units who have divergent thoughts and take active actions, they secretly report to the upper military department for strict punishment. Among the Japanese troops stationed in Tai'an, the Morikawa unit has more than 200 people. Because of their strong anti-war sentiments and a plan for a riot, the Japanese military officers learned of this and sent all of them to Qingdao. It is reported that Lieutenant Colonel Morikawa has committed suicide to take responsibility.</p>
<h3>Flourishing Opium, Gambling, and Prostitution in Kunshan; Puppet Organizations Collect Money from Them</h3>
<p>Kunshan Correspondence: After the war in Kunshan, it is full of scars. Although the stores on the main street have gradually recovered, most of them are outwardly strong but inwardly weak. There are very few with capital of more than 10,000 yuan. In this situation, opium, gambling, and prostitution have surpassed all other industries. According to investigations, the opium atmosphere in Kunshan was strictly prohibited before the war, and 80 to 90 percent of addicts had quit. However, after the fall, the puppet county government first lifted the ban on opium. Now, it has become even worse, establishing a puppet Anti-Smoking Bureau and openly setting up anti-smoking clinics, nominally to quit smoking, but in reality to collect money. At present, there are more and more people who have relapsed into addiction. There are about 60 to 70 anti-smoking clinics in the urban area and various villages, all of which are thriving. It can be seen that Kunshan has been severely poisoned. Gambling in Kunshan is because it is the time when the autumn harvest is on the market. Those returning home to harvest are mostly abundant, and rice prices are soaring. Generally, farmers have a lot of surplus. Local ruffians take the opportunity to set up gambling dens and collect commissions from gambling. Pitiful, ignorant farmers mostly fall into their trap. The puppet county police station collects illicit money from them every day. The gambling style in the villages is unprecedented. Kunshan is known as a land of culture and civilization. The establishment of brothels started after the war. Ruffians such as Zhang San and others, in the name of prospering the market, hired more than a dozen prostitutes from Suzhou and set up brothels in Qiandunjiao straight and in the city. Because of this, ordinary lewd teenagers flock to them. Cases of people being ruined because of playing with prostitutes are often heard.</p>
<h3>A Major Fire in Hupu, Changshu; Seventy-Five Households Burned Down</h3>
<p>Changshu Correspondence: Hupu in the east township was the most prosperous town before the war, with dense population, rows of shops, and convenient port access. After the war, it also experienced abnormal development for a time, but after being disturbed, it has gradually declined. At about 1:00 a.m. the day before yesterday, Wei Fenghuo's house in Tangdong of the town was negligent. At that time, the wind was strong and there was a lack of firefighting equipment. In an instant, the fire spread in all directions. The flames soared into the sky and the cries shook the wilderness. By dawn, a total of 75 households and 116 thatched and tile houses had been burned down. One person was burned to death and many were injured. It was an unprecedented disaster. At present, there is no proper solution for those who are homeless and exposed to the wind and dew.</p>
<h3>The Suffering of the People in Baoshan: Legal Tender Hidden at Home Confiscated; Grain Prevented from Entering</h3>
<p>Baoshan Correspondence: More than 100 new Japanese troops have arrived in Luodian and are searching house to house. Those who answer vaguely are shot. The shop assistants in various shops are forced to organize bamboo pole gun teams, each with a bamboo pole topped with a half-rusted bayonet. The Japanese army extracts one person and appoints him as an instructor. The Japanese army also issued a notice that 50 yuan of national currency hidden at home will be confiscated. Below 50 yuan, they can generally go to the Japanese army headquarters to exchange for Japanese currency. Corner tickets have disappeared. The substitute vouchers and stamps issued by the stores are still very popular. The county is not a rice-producing area. The autumn harvest is over, and people are using bran, rice chaff, and vegetable roots to fill their hunger. At first, rice was transported from Jiading to supply the people. However, after the new Japanese troops arrived in Luodian, rice from the west was generally blocked, and this has been going on for many days. There are nearly 1,000 puppet "Peace and National Salvation Army" troops in the area of Shengqiao, Wusong, and Yanghang. It is said that they were bought and reorganized from the troops of guerrillas Fan Shilin and Lu Axiang. Fan and Lu were appointed as puppet brigade commanders and deputy brigade commanders. However, a certain team leader named Jin refused to submit and has been arrested and killed by the army.</p>

<h3>Speculators and Monopolists Hoarding Rice Not Protected by Two Concessions; Will Be Deported and Stocks Confiscated; Citizens Can Report to Police Commissioner; Municipal Council Scheduled to Discuss Overall Grain Issues Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday (10th), the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement and the French Municipal Council jointly issued a notice, the original text of which is as follows: "Notice: It has been found that some people, greedy for personal gain and disregarding the plight of the poor, are hoarding, speculating, and monopolizing rice, causing the main food of the Chinese people to be very expensive at present, which is detrimental to the maintenance of the public order and good governance of the French Concession and the International Settlement of Shanghai. This is to announce that anyone who commits the above-mentioned acts will not be protected by the two concessions and may even be deported, and their stocks will be confiscated. It is hoped that all people, for the sake of the public interest, will report any hoarding, speculation, or monopolization of rice to the police commissioner of the French Concession or the International Settlement, providing detailed information so that they can be investigated and prosecuted. This is hereby announced."</p>
<h3>Bureau Convened a Special Meeting</h3>
<p>The soaring rice prices in Shanghai are related to the livelihood of ordinary people and the security of the concessions. The Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement is very concerned and has been secretly planning to stabilize prices and is in close contact with the French Concession authorities to jointly plan the implementation. According to reports from the Dazhong News Agency, the Municipal Council held a special meeting on the morning of the 9th to discuss the problem of soaring rice prices affecting people's food. Mr. Fessenden, Director-General and Chairman of the Bureau, and Sir Calder Marshall, Chairman of the Bureau's Food and Fuel Supply Committee, and other important officials attended. The meeting lasted a long time. According to recent records of bureau meetings, although the content has not been announced, it is generally observed that there may be very important decisions. Yesterday, although it was Sunday, the bureau suddenly issued a notice jointly with the French Concession authorities to ban rice speculators, which shows the determination of the authorities of the two concessions to take action. The Dazhong News Agency learned from reliable sources yesterday that the Municipal Council's Food and Fuel Supply Committee is scheduled to convene a special meeting today to discuss the overall issue of food rice in Shanghai, which will be chaired by Sir Marshall of the committee.</p>
<h3>Price Limit Too High; Still Hoping to Suppress</h3>
<p>After the rice price broke records and rose again, the authorities of the two concessions and various public groups are urgently seeking ways to suppress it. The former Bean and Rice Industry Association convened an emergency meeting and accepted the Municipal Council's intention to temporarily set the highest price limit for white rice at 45 yuan per stone and Ke Xian rice at 38 yuan. Everyone understands the authorities' concern for people's food and their painstaking efforts. However, according to the general opinions of various Chinese people in society, this price limit is still considered too high, because the general common people and ordinary wage-earning class have little monthly income. The vast majority of citizens still find it difficult to have enough to eat. After the rice price increase, all commodities are expensive, and the panic of life is still seriously threatened. This price limit means that the hoarding households who are speculating and manipulating have not been hit. It is hoped that the concession authorities and the rice industry will consider the hardships of the people's livelihood and quickly suppress the price limit again, so that speculators and manipulators have no way to use their skills, and maintain the prosperity and security of the concession. The authorities should adopt the opinions of the majority of citizens and reconsider the price limit issue.</p>
<h3>Bean and Rice Association Announced Measures</h3>
<p>After the main industry groups convened emergency meetings for days to discuss ways to suppress and stabilize rice prices, the Bean and Rice Industry Association issued a public announcement yesterday after the meeting the day before yesterday (9th), as follows: "It has been found that rice prices have been rising recently, which is very important to people's livelihood and security. We are constantly trying to remedy this in order to achieve balance. The Association, considering the importance of this matter, specially convened an emergency meeting of the Executive and Supervisory Committee on the 9th of this month, and the Market Management Committee sent representatives to attend the meeting. After detailed discussion, in addition to discussing various fundamental policies, which will be handled separately, the following are the palliative aspects: (1) Accepting the Municipal Council's intention, from the 10th of this month, the highest price of white rice shall not exceed 45 yuan per stone, and foreign rice and Ke Xian rice shall not exceed 38 yuan per stone. Du rice and foreign Xian rice are not included in this example. For those who have traded before the 9th of this month, the transaction price will be settled. The above-mentioned price limit shall be strictly enforced by the Market Management Committee. Those who violate it shall be reported to the concession authorities for severe punishment. (2) The Market Management Committee resolved on the 8th of this month to change the time limit for the delivery of national rice to three days, which should be recognized and supplemented. Regardless of national rice (including Ke Xian rice) or foreign rice, all deliveries must be completed within three days after the transaction. Those who violate it shall be severely punished. The above two items have been resolved and recorded for public announcement. It is hoped that everyone will comply with it. This is of utmost importance. This is hereby announced. The first day of December, the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China."</p>
<h3>Rice Market Tends to Stabilize Following Price Limit</h3>
<p>A reporter from Dazhong News Agency inspected the Fuzhou Road Qingliange Rice Industry Tea Party Market from 9:00 a.m. yesterday and saw that the rice market transactions were more stable than before. Management Committee members Fu Qiankeng and Cai Shengming came to the market to advise the industry to abide by the resolution of the Bean and Rice Industry Association the day before yesterday (9th). Therefore, rice prices fell to within the price limit set by the Municipal Council. After the market closed at 11:30 a.m., the 56th meeting was held at the public sample office. Cai Shengming, Hu Wenan, Zheng Shengyun, Yin Fuxiang, Zhou Zizhen, Gu Yisheng, Yang Shaoyuan, Fu Qiankeng, Xu Yesun, and others from the Market Management Committee attended. The meeting was chaired by Fu Qiankeng, who reported on the situation of the meeting with Ho Te-kuei of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement the day before yesterday and the situation of attending the meeting of the Bean and Rice Industry Association the day before yesterday. He also said that if the measures publicly resolved by the rice industry groups this time to suppress rice prices still fail to work, then it may be possible to form a public association to manage sales. However, the most practical way is still to ask each member to strongly persuade the industry to abide by the market sales rules and trade. The committee members present also unanimously agreed that the rice industry should consider the overall situation, embrace the spirit of sacrifice, and lower rice prices. If the overall situation is in danger, the rice industry will also perish together. Then, they resolved to recognize the resolution of the Bean and Rice Industry Association the day before yesterday (9th).</p>
<h3>Discussing the Purchase of Foreign Rice to Carry out Price Stabilization</h3>
<p>The Bean and Rice Industry Association is currently resolving to send letters to the authorities of the two concessions, the Chamber of Commerce, and Yu Qiaqing, asking them to organize collective orders for foreign rice and carry out price stabilization. According to reports from the Dazhong News Agency, this measure has been supported by the authorities and powerful groups and powerful people. Public group meetings will be convened in the coming days to actively proceed. It is expected that once this method is implemented, judging from the situation of the previous price stabilization where rice prices plummeted, the Shanghai rice market price will soon fall, which is expected.</p>
<h3>Requesting the Authorities to Find Ways to Dredge</h3>
<p>The source of domestic rice in various places is repeatedly obstructed by the Japanese, resulting in great difficulties in transporting rice to Shanghai. Rice weevils are taking the opportunity to become active and raise market prices. The entire rice market is evolving into a chaotic situation. All rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains transported by train the day before yesterday are not allowed to be transported to the concession. A public announcement was posted at the North Railway Station, "All rice and grain transported to Shanghai by train or ship in the future must be registered by the owner at North Sichuan Road. After approval, they can be transported to the concession. Otherwise, they will only be allowed to be sold in Hongkou." Now, the same industry association of the Bean and Rice Industry is resolved to send letters to the authorities of the two concessions: (1) Find ways to dredge the source of domestic rice as soon as possible. (2) Convene various public groups to discuss group orders for foreign rice, so as to increase rice reserves. (3) Request negotiations for 50,000 to 100,000 packages of "removal certificates" for Wuhu Xian rice, so that vendors can purchase and transport them. It is reported that the rice industry groups are also petitioning the concession authorities to negotiate with the consular corps of various countries with the Japanese side, allowing rice merchants to transport rice freely and reduce donations and taxes.</p>
<h3>More Than Ten Groups Appeal for Restraint</h3>
<p>The First Special District and the Citizens' Federation of this city have already petitioned the authorities to maintain people's food. In addition, the City Chamber of Commerce, the Silver and Money Industry Association, the Lawyers' Association, the Accountants' Association, the Thrift Committee, and the printing industry and other groups have jointly filed a petition with the authorities, requesting that they severely restrain those in this city who manipulate the rice market and attempt to profit, and request that they take effective measures as soon as possible to suppress and stabilize rice prices to maintain people's food.</p>
<h3>The Panic of Fractional Currency is Relieved; One-Yuan Notes are Issued; Fractional Notes to be Approved and Issued Today; Large Batch of Corner Tickets to be Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The four banks of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Agricultural Bank are issuing and exchanging new one-yuan notes transported from Hong Kong in addition to issuing two batches of fractional currency notes on the 8th to relieve the panic of the lack of fractional currency notes in Shanghai. At the same time, the City Chamber of Commerce will crack down on hoarding for profit. The Ministry of Finance has been telegraphed to quickly increase the printing of fractional currency notes and transport them to Shanghai for assistance. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Separately Review and Approve Fractional Notes</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Branch of the Central Bank issued the second batch of fractional currency notes from the 8th, the members of the Silver and Money Industry Association, the banks and the four major companies have been issued for circulation. Various industries and associations of major factories and merchants have been separately reviewed and the number has been approved. They will be issued from today (Sunday). However, those who go to receive them must exchange them with a notice from the Central Shanghai Bank. As for the third batch of fractional currency notes, it has been printed by the American firm Yongning Company. Once printed, it will be connected to the second batch for distribution.</p>
<h3>Resolutely Crack Down on Hoarding for Profit</h3>
<p>The panic of fractional currency notes in Shanghai is due to the inflow of currency into the occupied areas, but it is inevitable that there is manipulation by hoarders, using premiums to make profits, and other forces trying to affect the credit of legal tender. In addition to issuing fractional currency notes to remedy the situation, the Central Bank has also sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce to crack down on hoarding for profit. It is reported that the City Chamber of Commerce has transferred the letter to the money exchange and tobacco exchange industries, ordering members, money changers, and tobacco shops to pay attention and not to hoard in order to avoid affecting change. If the above-mentioned situation is found, it will be severely punished.</p>
<h3>Corner Tickets Will Be Loaded on Foreign Ships and Shipped to Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the Central Bank has issued and exchanged as much of the new and old one-yuan notes in its inventory as possible, HSBC has also transported a large number of new one-yuan notes from Hong Kong for exchange, so the panic of the lack of one-yuan notes has been eliminated. In the past, small money shops sold one-yuan notes, charging a premium of 18 yuan per thousand yuan. Now it has been reduced to 5 or 6 yuan. Regarding the fractional currency notes issue, since the Ministry of Finance has telegraphed to increase printing and transport them to Shanghai for adjustment, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned from the banking community that a large batch of new one-corner and two-corner fractional currency notes will be loaded on foreign ships by foreign banks and transported from Hong Kong to Shanghai for assistance.</p>
<h3>Wartime Losses in the Silver and Money Industry to be Investigated and Reported by Order of the Ministry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Association recently received an order from the Ministry of Finance to thoroughly investigate the losses suffered by various banks and money shops during the Anti-Japanese War, with an attached copy of the investigation method, containing more than ten articles, and a deadline for collection and reporting for verification. It is reported that the two industry associations have issued notices to members, banks and money shops to comply.</p>

In the thirteenth year, he served as the Minister of the Army. After the successful completion of the Northern Expedition, Wu followed Duan Qirui south and later served as a senior advisor of the Military Council of the National Government. After the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War in the year before last, Wu moved to Hong Kong. He passed away at his residence in Hong Kong on November 15th of this year.</p>
<p>Strict Security, Momentary Grandeur</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Couber Apartments, where the memorial service was held, was adorned with a tall, colorful archway with a white cloth banner that read "Memorial Service for Army General Wu." The entrance to the hall was also decorated with a colorful archway. In the center of the altar hung a portrait of the late General Wu, along with a floral shrine made of fresh flowers. The table was adorned with fresh fruits and pastries. Dozens of floral wreaths presented by various circles were displayed on the stage, along with plain-colored embroidered satin curtains. The hall was filled with elegiac couplets, creating a simple and solemn atmosphere. Wu's eldest son, Bi Chang, second son, Bi Fa, third son, Bi Kang, and other family members all attended the service in mourning attire. From 8 a.m. onwards, people from all walks of life came to pay their respects in an endless stream. The venue was equipped with both Chinese and Western music bands. The French police dispatched detectives to maintain strict security around the apartments. Yesterday, the entrance to the apartments was filled with plain cars and white horses, a sight of great splendor for a moment.</p>
<p>Chairman Lin and Others Sent Elegiac Couplets</p>
<p>Hundreds of elegiac couplets were presented by various circles. Government officials and prominent figures in Shanghai all sent condolences. Among them was a cloth banner with the words "Strong Grass in a Gale" presented by Chairman Lin of the National Government, which was hung at the highest point.

<p>Eulogy of Yesterday's Memorial Service</p>
<p>On December 10th of the 28th year of the Republic of China, your humble brothers Yu Hede, Xu Guoan, and Xu Yuan, with incense, flowers, and delicacies, offer this sacrifice to the spirit of Army General Wu Zitang: Alas, our lord, a pillar of the nation, who commanded wind and cloud, and had military strategies across the land. He was a national treasure, a star spirit incarnate, who came from Mangdang Mountain. From Jielin Hongyi, he gained fame and reputation. First he knew the poetry and rites, and the school was like a crane standing. He threw away the pen and went overseas, studied jade in order to polish the rough, and learned about military tactics. He returned to assist the military government, and received honorary positions. In the borders of Song and Xing, he soothed the people. He was a general for the army, and he was based on the upper reaches of the river. In the turmoil of Sichuan and Hunan, he built a marquis in harmony with the times. His flags and banners fluttered with brilliance, his jade tent was full of strategies. In the first battle of Yangshu, he wore light fur clothes with a loose belt. Lord Yu admired the moon and roared, and the civil and military people admired him, and showed the demeanor of a Confucius general. He summarized the military hub, and his sharp edges became more prominent. The old assistant generals and lieutenant generals were mostly in their respective defense regions. Thanking the masses, Duke Jin showed the frost on his temples. As times changed, he still tried to repay his loyalty. A great catastrophe came, and the swallow clouds opened up the troubles. The people are suffering and they are heartbroken. He concealed his figure in southern Xinjiang, and had many trials and tribulations. He protects the country with heroic spirit, and he shows the world his noble integrity. His type can be used, and the whole country mourns together. He rides in a spiritual carriage to the sea, and comes to Songmei. A cry at the coffin and a callback to the friendship. Now that the ceremony is over, may the cloud flag stay for a long time.

<h3>Sending New Year's Cards to Europe - Another Shortcut; Cards Can Reach England and France by the New Year</h3>
<p>With the European war raging and the fires of battle spreading everywhere, foreign nationals in Shanghai are deeply concerned about national affairs. Although the number of New Year's cards and similar New Year's calendars and Christmas gifts may be less than in previous years, the number sent through the post office is still quite congested. If you want to send a New Year's card from Shanghai to England and France, whether via the Suez Canal or via the Pacific Ocean, it must arrive by January 10th of next year. In fact, it is impossible to arrive before the end of this year, but if it is delivered to the Siberian route (Via Siberia) before the 14th of this month, it can still arrive in Paris and London before the New Year. If the letter is marked "Via Siberia," the post office will hand it over to the train and seal it directly to Tianjin. In terms of the journey, it can arrive in two days and catch up with the mail sealed and sent in Tianjin on the 17th of this month (Sunday). The arrival time in Moscow is December 27th, the arrival time in London is January 3rd, 1940, and the arrival time in Paris is January 5th, 1940. If the letter is submitted today or tomorrow and marked "Via Siberia," it is expected to catch up with the mail packet sealed in Tianjin on the 14th of this month. The arrival time in Moscow is the 24th of this month, the arrival time in London is the end of this year, and the arrival time in Paris is also November 2nd of next year. Compared with sending by airmail, it seems to be more economical. If sent by airmail, the last batch of delivery time at the Hong Kong Post Office is the 21st. The Royal New Aircraft (i.e., I.A.L.) can fly out of Hong Kong on the 27th and arrive in London and Paris on January 3rd of next year. If handed over to the Sino-French Airlines (i.e., .AF. route) or the Sino-American Airlines of the United American Airlines (i.e., P.A.A. route), they can also arrive in London and Paris on January 6th of next year. If sent to San Francisco in the United States or Sydney, it will be even faster, about three days earlier than London and Paris. However, since the opening of Sino-Japanese air traffic, mail to the United States is often sent via this route. The post office seals and sends airmail rates every month (加納航空資費,郵局每月二十點封發). Sending from Shanghai to Japan by airmail, and then connecting to a ship sailing from Yokohama, is even faster.</p>
<h3>American Merchant Ship "Da Xin" Sinks After Hitting a Reef</h3>
<p>The American merchant ship "Da Xin," represented by the Lianchang Foreign Firm in this city, successfully test-sailed from Shanghai to Wenzhou at the end of last month. On the morning of the 4th of this month, it loaded cargo and left Ou for Shanghai. Unexpectedly, when it sailed to the waters outside the mouth of the Oujiang River, it suddenly hit a reef. The rear compartment was breached, seawater poured in, and the ship sank. The company initially received no detailed report of the incident, but it was fully confirmed until yesterday. The ship was owned by American merchants and was a small sea vessel with a displacement of only over 500 tons. This time, it was returning to Shanghai from Wenzhou with a large amount of cargo. At about 10 a.m. on the 4th, after sailing out of the mouth of the Oujiang River, it unexpectedly encountered wind in the waters about five li away from Huanghuaguan. Because the ship's tonnage was too small to withstand the waves, it lost control and mistakenly hit a hidden reef. The bottom of the rear compartment was broken, and seawater poured in, causing the ship to gradually sink. The American captain immediately sounded the siren for help. Fortunately, it was during the day, and there were many sailboats passing by, so they gathered to rescue. All the crew members were spared and took the sailing boats to Wenzhou, and then waited for the ship to return. Also, when the ship had an accident, because there was no wireless equipment on board, the company did not receive a formal telegram until yesterday. The company did not know the details of the accident until yesterday, when they received a detailed telegram confirming that the ship had completely sunk, with only the chimney deck still visible above the water. The hull had marine insurance.</p>
<h3>The Iron Gate of Xin Kai River is Rumored to Open Today</h3>
<p>The iron gates connecting the French Concession and the Min Guo Road French Concession, including the Xin Bei Men, Lao Bei Men, Xiao Bei Men, and Xin Kai He gates, were closed by the French Concession authorities after the Shanghai war to prevent unexpected events. Those entering and exiting the Nanshi and the concession must have a pass issued by the French Concession authorities, otherwise they must detour through Pudong. According to a New Sound Agency reporter, the French Concession authorities, in consideration of the plight of civilians, will tentatively open the iron gate at Xin Kai River from today. Those passing through this point do not need a concession permit; those entering Nanshi only need to hold a "resident certificate." It is reported that the French Concession authorities will tentatively open it for five days and consider the attitude of the concession authorities after that, depending on the situation after the opening, and whether to continue to open it. However, this news could not be verified by this newspaper's reporter last night after various inquiries.</p>
<h3>Suggesting that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Unite to Control Prices; Please Unite with the Two Concession Authorities and the Court to Organize a Committee to Suppress Hoarding and Speculation</h3>
<p>The soaring prices in Shanghai have affected the livelihood of the people. Recently, someone suggested that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce unite with various agencies to organize a committee to find ways to suppress prices and stabilize the market. The suggestion letter stated that the recent surge in rice prices in the city, whose high prices have broken previous records, has made life difficult for civilians. If no measures are taken to suppress prices as soon as possible, rice prices will continue to rise and the consequences will be endless. It is heard that Hong Kong, Tianjin, and other places have implemented price controls. For the sake of the public in this city and for the sake of social stability, it is requested that your association immediately unite with the工部局, the French Municipal Council, and the First and Second Special District Courts to organize a committee to implement price controls in the city, investigate whether there is hoarding and speculation in various industries, and formulate penalties for those who manipulate speculation and raise prices, in order to suppress market prices and stabilize the market. If this can be implemented, it will be the good fortune of all the citizens of Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Winter Stroll - Sketches of French Park -</h3>
<p>— Frost Gentleman</p>
<p>On Saturday afternoon, Zhong'er of fourth grade in elementary school and Min'er of the kindergarten didn't have class. After the meal, I negotiated with Xia to go to the theater, but without any results because I was extremely annoyed by the huge expenditure on rice today. - Rice, the top-quality常帮costs forty-six yuan per stone, the second-quality常帮costs forty-two yuan; rice merchants smiled happily, but the common people couldn't swallow. - "Let's go, it's been two or three weeks since we went to the park." Then, I asked the maid to trick the youngest Lin'er out, carried Zhong'er and Min'er with me, and walked towards the entrance of the French Park with rice's annoyance still heavy in my heart.</p>
<p>The entrance to the park was unexpectedly quiet. The children who usually exchanged nickel coins for temporary tickets to facilitate tourists without "passes" were also gone. The weather was cold and tourists were scarce, so their "business" could not be done. A nickel coin could earn three cents of premium, which was a very good business, but now they have lost the opportunity to speculate, and tourists feel inconvenienced. I asked the guard how to buy a ticket without nickel coins, and he said that I could exchange them at the ticket office at the intersection of Hua Long Road. So I had to go around to the entrance of Hua Long Road again.</p>
<p>"Hey! Do you want nickel coins?" A haggard middle-aged man, playing with the sound of many nickel coins in his hand, asked me.</p>
<p>"How many points of premium do you want?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Three cents for one dime," he offered the exchange rate.</p>
<p>"Two cents, is that okay?" I only had tungsten coins from the tram that cost two cents each in my pocket. I asked him if he could reduce the premium by one cent.</p>
<p>"No, my cost is still two cents."</p>
<p>I didn't want to be entangled with him any longer, and walked towards the park entrance. By the way, I bought three bags of spiced beans for one dime of paper money and received four cents in change. The nickel coin exchanger saw that I had change, and he ran up to negotiate the deal again, but I ignored him. I walked to the ticket booth at the entrance of the park, put in a one-dime bill, exchanged it for a one-dime nickel coin without discount, put it into the ticket machine that looked like a slot machine, got the ticket, and led the two children victoriously into the French Park.</p>
<p>Just inside the park entrance, I saw a little girl of four or five years old crying next to the guard, saying that her mother was lost. This reminded me of the large number of orphans recently taken in by the 工部局's Children's Protection Section and the Orphanage, and I couldn't help but feel sad.</p>
<p>A month ago, during the season of "autumn skies, fat crabs, holding crabs and enjoying chrysanthemums," the French Park was unusually lush, with paulownia trees spreading their magnificent branches and chrysanthemums blooming, attracting people to stroll and admire. You held your lover's hand, strolling in the paulownia-lined avenues, the scorching sun secretly smiled and blessed you from the dense green leaves; walking, walking, leisurely walking, strolling to the lawn, walking into the flowerbeds; at that time, your hearts were filled with "unspoken beauty," and you felt the greatness of life! But now these scenes are gone. The love of youth is only a fleeting moment. The ruthless frost has deprived the flowers and trees of their abundant life. Youth is fleeting, and the leaves are falling. Now only dry branches remain.</p>
<p>There were fewer tourists, but it hasn't been that cold in the past few days. It should be said that it was a warm winter day, with the wind gently kissing your face and the sun gently caressing you, and red clouds flying on your cheeks as if you were drunk. Children were playing on the lawn, and their innocent childishness made them forget the suffering of sitting on hard benches for a week. Around the simple fountain, leisurely men and women sat, some reading and some whispering to each other.</p>
<p>"This water keeps spraying out, how come the water in the pond doesn't overflow?" Zhong'er pointed to the spray in the pond and asked curiously.</p>
<p>We walked to the big pond and sat down. Looking at the sunny side opposite, the leaves of a paulownia tree had not yet completely fallen, and the sun reflected a dazzling light on the sparse leaves. Under the tree-lined avenue, people's shadows flickered in the distance, and occasionally one or two young women strolled across the small bridge opposite. I asked Zhong'er intentionally or unintentionally if he had a pencil, and he said no. But even if he had a pencil, what could I do? I deeply regretted not being able to learn how to draw! I really wanted to depict this scene at that time.</p>
<p>So I walked to the paulownia tree opposite and sat down on the semicircular embankment. There were exactly three empty chairs, and we each occupied one. Facing the sun, I closed my eyes and listened quietly to the rustling of the leaves. The wind was gentle and the sun was shining brightly, it was truly intoxicating and sleepy. Golden carp in the pond, about four or five inches long, swam back and forth, looking for food on the surface of the water. Min'er chewed the beans into pieces and spat them into the water. After a while, a layer of golden yellow floated on the bottom of the water, and hundreds of goldfish swam leisurely to snatch the bean crumbs, sucking up with their pointed mouths, and then quickly sinking down with their tails wagging. I curiously rolled up my sleeves and waited by the pond, and when the fish came to snatch the food, I quickly reached out to catch them. For a while, I caught a fish's head, but it still broke free. I suddenly discovered many small shrimps in the gaps along the stone bank, and Zhong'er also took off his coat and reached out to catch them. In the end, they caught nine of them, jumping non-stop in their hands, and finally they put them back into the water.</p>
<p>Occasionally, a breeze came and ruffled the pond water with many wrinkles. The sun gradually set, and the desolate park was covered with a layer of glorious golden light. We said goodbye to the fish and walked towards the zoo with interest.</p>
<p>"Hey, when are we going to the Shanghai West Club? It's so much fun there."</p>
<p>I heard someone talking behind me, and it turned out to be two young men in suits. I doubted the greatness of the magic power of the Shanghai West Club and the like.</p>
<p>We bought tickets again and walked into the zoo. I was already tired of these animals, but Min'er always wanted to see the dozens of monkeys every time she came. In fact, there were indeed the most people watching the monkeys, and unlike those who glanced at the lions, tigers, and birds and left, many people often surrounded them, teasing them, and throwing food to them. This may be because monkeys are the ancestors of mankind and have some human nature, just as humans still have some monkey nature. For example, if you throw in a peanut or other food, the monkeys will chase and snatch it, but the result is often that the most ferocious and largest monkey snatches it away. The little monkeys quickly run away after hearing the roar of the big monkey. But out of pity for the little monkeys, people often throw food to the little monkeys when the big monkey is not paying attention. The children clapped their hands and cheered, forgetting to return. But monkeys are after all natural savages and kill each other. Isn't the whole world of mankind the same as monkeys!</p>
<h3>Over Two Thousand Unemployed Chinese Laborers from Foreign Ships Arrive in Shanghai in Batches to Transfer Back to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Seamen's Office, since the outbreak of the European War, submarines have appeared and attacked航輪 from various countries, which is very active, resulting in ships from the various nations suspending voyages or shortening their routes. As for Britain, it has modified and armed a thousand of its merchant ships. Therefore, many of its workers and engineers have been discharged and dismissed. Consequently, the number of unemployed Chinese ship laborers returning to their country has reached over 2,100. These unemployed Chinese ship laborers originally served on merchant ships from countries such as Britain, Germany, France, Italy, Holland, Norway, and Greece, working as sailors, stokers, painters, carpenters, etc., for periods ranging from a dozen years. Now, due to the outbreak of the European War, they have been successively discharged and returned to their country. They are now transferring to Shanghai in batches to return to their hometowns such as Wenzhou, Qingtian, Rui'an, Ningbo Zhoushan, etc. They will have to wait for the end of the European war before being summoned by foremen to continue serving in their original shipping companies.</p>

<h3>American Warship "Quillfish" Returns to Shanghai; Will First Study the Contents of the Case of Japanese Military Police Assaulting American Sailors Before Conducting Negotiations</h3>
<p>At 10:30 a.m. on the 6th, a plainclothes officer from the Japanese Military Police intruded onto an American naval boat anchored at the No. 4 pontoon on the Bund, interfered with the military supplies on the boat, and even assaulted Mr. Russell, an officer from the American Naval Purchasing Office. After this incident occurred, the director of the purchasing office, Lieutenant Colonel Chuan Shu, reported the details to Rear Admiral Glassford, commander of the American Yangtze River Patrol. The admiral, who was on a mission to Wuhu, attached great importance to the report. According to the Japanese naval spokesman's statement on the evening of the 8th, the case had been resolved due to the visit of a Japanese officer's American representative. However, according to information obtained by reporters, the Japanese spokesman's remarks were only a one-sided view. The American Consulate could not verify the Japanese side's statement. It is now learned that Rear Admiral Glassford urgently returned to Shanghai from Wuhu yesterday. The American warship "Luzon" also came. It is believed that the assault on American naval personnel is a matter for the naval side, and the American Consulate is not prepared to intervene. This matter will be studied by Rear Admiral Glassford before negotiations are initiated. A scene of international dispute will be given new development due to Rear Admiral's arrival in Shanghai.</p>

<h3>Destruction of Japanese Telephone Poles by Fire</h3>
<p>The mainland press reports that, within the compound of the Japanese Telephone and Telegraph Company on Gongxing Road, Zhabei, one hundred and fifty telephone poles treated with preservative oil caught fire yesterday (the 9th) due to carelessness. The resulting thick smoke engulfed the northeastern part of Shanghai for two hours. The Hongkou Fire Brigade, alerted at 1:45 PM, rushed to the scene. However, upon arrival, they found that the way the telephone poles were piled made it impossible to spray water on them. As a result, the poles were completely destroyed, with losses estimated at one thousand yuan. According to Japanese sources, the Japanese compound was affected by the flames, causing the stored telephone poles to quickly catch fire and burn. The fire started at 1:00 PM. The guard of the compound initially believed that the fire could be extinguished without assistance. However, after forty-five minutes, they were still unable to contain the fire and called for fire trucks to put it out.</p>
<h3>Printing Next Year's Calendars to Include Air Defense Slogans</h3>
<p>The National Air Defense Committee believes that, since the outbreak of war and the ravages of Japanese aircraft, rigorous air defense is the top priority in wartime. For widespread publicity, to inform the public of how to avoid danger, it has specifically stipulated that air defense slogans should be included when printing calendars for the 29th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1940], so that the public becomes accustomed to seeing and hearing them and is more aware and vigilant. In addition to ordering bookstores and printing houses to comply, it has also instructed industrial and commercial organizations to inform factories and businesses that when printing calendars for the 29th year, they should all comply with this requirement to facilitate air defense propaganda.</p>

<h3>Wheelock &amp; Co. Sues China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for Large Sum in Ship Price Dispute, Alleging Failure to Deliver Sold Vessel; Defendant Denies Existence of Concluded Sales Contract, Refuses to Pay Compensation; Court Orders Investigation and Further Hearing</h3>
<p>Ye Chuanfang, manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company at No. 2, the Bund, French Concession, was recently sued in the Second Special Court's civil division by Madden, manager of the British firm Wheelock &amp; Co., represented by lawyers Xu Shihao and Rong Zhenlong. The suit requests a ruling ordering the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to deliver the steamship "Iden" according to law, with the plaintiff paying the defendant the ship's price of:</p>
<p>£20,000 British Gold.</p>
<p>The defendant is also to pay the plaintiff compensation for losses at a rate of £1,360 per month from October 11th of this year until the date of actual delivery. If the defendant cannot deliver the ship, in addition to compensating for the aforementioned losses, they must also compensate the plaintiff an additional £10,000. According to the complaint, the court held a hearing yesterday in Civil Court No. 7, presided over by Judge Yu Changzi. The defendant, Ye Chuanfang, accompanied by his attorney Jiang Yiping, appeared in court. First, attorney Xu Shihao, representing the plaintiff Wheelock &amp; Co., stated the plaintiff's intentions, saying that the defendant, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, sent a letter to the plaintiff on October 4th of this year, offering to sell the:</p>
<p>Steamship "Iden"</p>
<p>for £20,000 British Gold. The time for the contract was set for noon on October 7th. At that time, Ye Chuanfang, the legal representative of the defendant China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, went to the Wheelock &amp; Co. office. Madden, the legal representative of the plaintiff Wheelock &amp; Co., immediately agreed and signed the original letter from the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, declaring acceptance. Ye also signed to confirm, believing that the sales contract had been completed in accordance with Article 345 of the Civil Code. As for the method of delivery of the ship, both parties agreed that it would depend on the condition of the ship's repairs. Madden immediately ordered his female secretary, Goldenberg, to write a letter:</p>
<p>Given to Ye Chuanfang</p>
<p>Stating that the terms of the sale were that the buyer had the option to choose whether the ship would be delivered after repairs or in its current condition, and that this choice had to be declared before signing the contract. Two days later, the defendant responded, stating that the cost of repairing the ship in Hong Kong was more than HK$111,300. The plaintiff then declared that they would accept delivery in its current condition and attached a draft contract for signing. Unexpectedly, the defendant suddenly denied that the plaintiff had made a commitment and said that the sale of the ship had not been confirmed, and also claimed that the ship was not owned by the defendant. In fact, the ship was purchased with a loan from the plaintiff to the defendant. Subsequently, attorney Jiang Yiping, representing the defendant, argued that based on the correspondence presented by the plaintiff, the sales contract between the two parties:</p>
<p>Was never established</p>
<p>The "Iden" steamship is owned by China Merchants Steamship Co. and the defendant only introduced the sale. According to the law, the sale has not been established, and the plaintiff is demanding that the defendant compensate for losses of more than £10,000, equivalent to 700,000 or 800,000 yuan in national currency. The defendant has no such obligation and requests that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. Next, female secretary Goldenberg and Song Wenkui testified about the writing and signing of the letter. Afterwards, according to the defendant Ye Chuanfang's testimony, it was true that he borrowed money from the plaintiff to buy the ship, but the important documents he exchanged with the plaintiff did not state words such as "verified". The court, upon reviewing the testimony, deemed it necessary to investigate further and adjourned the hearing to a later date.</p>
<h3>Son Commits Suicide Due to Financial Difficulties; Bank Sues His Father, Who Claims He Has No Obligation to Inherit Debts</h3>
<p>Li Zhufeng, an old man from Zhenjiang residing at No. 11, Caihe Lane, Tiantong Road, is sixty-four years old this year. His son, Li Xieqing, previously opened the Tongmao Electrical Supplies Store and the Tongtai Customs Brokerage on Guangdong Road. Later, due to business failure and financial difficulties, he suddenly committed suicide by taking poison at the China Hotel on Guizhou Road in mid-July of this year, and could not be saved. His widow, through lawyer Xiong Fei, applied to the First Special Court's civil division for limited inheritance rights, which was approved. Recently, however, the Huizhong Bank, claiming that Li Xieqing still had outstanding debts, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit in the First Special Court's civil division against his father, Li Zhufeng, to recover the debts. The case was heard yesterday in Civil Court No. 3 by Judge Ni Wei'ou. The plaintiff's lawyer presented the case, and the defendant also appeared with his lawyer, Shen Hanzhang. They stated that since the debt was owed by the defendant's son, his father had no obligation to inherit it and requested that the plaintiff's lawsuit be dismissed. The court, upon reviewing the testimony, adjourned the hearing to the 16th of this month.</p>
<h3>Crying Discovered Inside Abandoned Coffin; Sick Child Ultimately Dies</h3>
<p>At 10:30 PM on the 7th of this month, a five-foot red wooden coffin was found abandoned in front of No. 675, Route Gustave de Lessers. It was discovered by a Sikh watchman from No. 268 who heard a very faint crying sound from inside the coffin. The watchman opened the coffin and found a five- or six-year-old boy who was unconscious due to serious illness. He had been placed in the coffin by his family and abandoned, but had then revived. The watchman took him to the police station and then transferred him to the Guangci Hospital. However, he ultimately died of his illness on the morning of the 9th at 10:00 AM. The hospital notified the police station, but the child's name, origin, and address could not be determined. The child's body was sent to the morgue to await examination by the court.</p>
<h3>Yuanhe Restaurant Bloodshed Case Details Clear; Gangsters Seek Revenge; Four Suspects Tried and Awaiting Sentencing</h3>
<p>Lu Tinghe, a Wuxi native and employee of the Yuanhe Restaurant at No. 292, Shanxi Road, was seriously injured in an altercation on the afternoon of the 21st of last month at 7:00 PM. He hired a rickshaw to take him to Renji Hospital for treatment, but he was already on the verge of death at the Beijing Road intersection. The rickshaw puller, Wang Fenglou, very alertly took him to the Lao Zha Police Station, where he:</p>
<p>Died Shortly After</p>
<p>Recently, detectives Wang Jinsheng, Han Shoushan, and Jin Deshun from the General Police Department apprehended four suspects: Xu Shujin, Sun Changbiao, Zhang Maotong, and Dong Changyou, all natives of Siyang and employees of the sesame cake shop at No. 288, Shanxi Road. They were handed over to the First Special District Court, and the police charged them with the crime of causing death by injury under the criminal code. The presiding judge, Jiang Shuzi, specially opened Criminal Court No. 3 yesterday morning to hear the case. The police lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the case was complex. Initially, according to:</p>
<p>Yuanhe Restaurant</p>
<p>Owner Yu Shougen, on the afternoon of the 19th of this month at 7:00 PM, six diners with northern accents came to eat, and the bill totaled one yuan and fifty cents. Before leaving, they only paid one yuan and left. The next evening, they came again to eat, causing an argument, and they fled in a crowd. On the 20th, they invited more than ten people to the restaurant to cause trouble, resulting in Lu Tinghe being injured and dying. In fact, the case was originally caused by the sesame cake shop opened by the defendant Xu Shujin, whose back door faced the restaurant. In the past, they had disagreements over tap water:</p>
<p>They often had disagreements</p>
<p>Later, Bai Qiyuan, a native of Siyang who was at large, set up a sweet potato stall at the entrance of the sesame cake shop, accusing an apprentice at Yuanhe Restaurant of stealing sweet potatoes from his stall. The restaurant owner was notified, but he lost face and invited a strong Wuxi native to question and beat Bai Qiyuan. Bai was unwilling to submit and invited Lao Kai, a fellow native of Siyang, Xu Xiaoshitou, the nephew of the defendant Xu Shujin, and Hemp Face, a fellow native who had a sesame cake stall on Hankou Road, as well as the fourth defendant, Dong Changyou. That evening they went to Yuanhe Restaurant to:</p>
<p>Seek revenge</p>
<p>Resulting in Lu Tinghe being fatally wounded with a knife. However, it was alleged that the defendants Xu Shujin, Zhang Maotong, and Sun Changbiao were also at the scene of the crime. After Yu Shougen, the owner of Yuanhe Restaurant, testified, he stated that the four defendants had all helped to commit the crime. The defendants Xu Shujin, Sun Changbiao, Zhang Maotong, and Dong Changyou all denied participating in the incident. They hired Zheng Wenkai as their lawyer to defend them. The court ruled that the four defendants would remain in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Head of Newspaper Vendors Killed; Main Offender Sentenced to Fifteen Years in Prison</h3>
<p>Wu Guisheng, the head of the newspaper vendors, had a feud with fellow vendor Li Changyu (nickname "Little Hubei") over soliciting a female prostitute. Li then harbored a malicious intent and lured Wu into Lane 604, Fuzhou Road, on March 21st of this year with several accomplices. They used sharp blades to slash Wu more than ten times, resulting in his murder. Afterwards, the police captured four accomplices, including Xu Asi, and they were sentenced by the First Special Court to varying degrees of punishment. Li was at large, but was recently captured by detective Chen Ruisheng of the Lao Zha Police Station. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin filed a lawsuit against him in the First Special Court according to law. The case has now been concluded. The presiding judge, Xiao Xiefen, opened court the day before yesterday to pronounce the judgment: Li Changyu was sentenced to fifteen years in prison for joint murder and deprived of his civil rights for ten years.</p>
<h3>Chinese Constable Murders Mistress; Sentenced to Ten Years in Prison</h3>
<p>Wu Yuguang (28 years old), a constable with the General Police Department with badge number 2478 and a native of Shandong, had an affair with Zhang Yueying (20 years old), a woman from Nanjing. Zhang had repeatedly asked Wu to rent a house and live with her, but Wu refused because of his weak financial situation, leading to disputes. On the evening of July 12th of this year, Wu and Zhang went to Room 10 of the Tongli Public Hostel at No. 6, Lane 195, Fujian Road, for an intimate rendezvous. The next morning, Wu suddenly jumped out of the window and injured his back. The tea boy then discovered that Zhang Yueying had been murdered in the room, with multiple stab wounds on her body and a necktie around her neck. He reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station, and detective Guo Ruiquan rushed to the scene and arrested Wu. Because Wu was also injured, he was sent to the hospital for treatment. Now that he has recovered, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin has charged him with murder in the First Special Court. Wu also hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend him. The trial has now concluded. The presiding judge, Xiao Xiefen, opened court the day before yesterday to pronounce the judgment: Wu Yuguang was sentenced to ten years in prison for murder and deprived of his civil rights for ten years.</p>
<h3>Extortion of Cattle Dealers Punished</h3>
<p>Zhu Lujun, a cattle dealer from Pudong, had transported seventeen head of cattle to Shanghai for sale from October 1st of this year to the 8th of this month. However, when passing Haig Road in western Shanghai, Wang Fugen, a local gangster from Ningbo, stopped Zhu and forcibly demanded a protection fee of five yuan per head of cattle, totaling eighty-five yuan. Zhu had no choice but to pay sixty yuan before he was allowed to pass. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, when Zhu was drinking tea at the teahouse at No. 67, Haig Road, Wang gathered a crowd to demand the remaining twenty-five yuan. Zhu reported it to the police station, who sent detective Wu Wenxiang to arrest Wang. He was brought to Criminal Court No. 2 of the First Special Court yesterday morning. After Judge Xiao inquired, Wang Fugen was sentenced to eight months in prison.</p>

<h3>Suicide Cases</h3>
<p>Luo Guangsan: Luo Guangsan, residing at No. 164, Taopeng Road, eastern Shanghai, recently found life difficult due to the advent of severe winter and the continued rise in the price of goods. He committed suicide by taking poison at home yesterday morning at around 1:00 AM. Afterwards, his roommate discovered him and sent him to the hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Zhang Wangshi: Zhang Shaoqing, a native of Nanjing, fifty-two years old, who worked on ships, came to the Zhu Shunxing Inn at No. 379, Dongmulaikou Street, Rue Adoard in the French Concession, on the 12th of last month with his wife, Wangshi (fifty-one years old), and their two children (eleven years old). They rented Room 5. On the midnight of the 8th of this month, Zhang took his children and left without saying goodbye, abandoning Wangshi at the inn. Wangshi woke up and, feeling abandoned, had a moment of despair and committed suicide by hanging herself with a belt on the bed frame in the room. At 10:00 AM on the 9th, the tea boy discovered her and reported it to the police station, who sent detectives to investigate. Although she was already dead, her body was still warm, so an ambulance was called to take her to Guangci Hospital. She ultimately died despite efforts to save her.</p>
<p>Xu Ren: Xu Ren, a local girl residing at No. 16, across from the Great World on Route Nimeteigne, French Concession, fifteen years old this year, was scolded by her mother, Xu Ding (thirty years old), on the 9th because of something, leading to a conflict.

Her mother discovered her and sent her to the Third Hospital of the Red Cross Society on Jiaozhou Road. However, she had been poisoned too deeply and died at 8:00 AM yesterday morning despite efforts to save her.</p>

<h3>Marital Knowledge: Secrets to Eternal Love Between Husband and Wife</h3>

<p>To be frank, marriage is the union of sexual relationships. When a young man marries a young woman, after the wedding ceremony, unless there are hidden illnesses or other reasons, they will consummate their relationship. Considering the nature of women, their ideal for their lifelong partner must be very high during their virginity. Sometimes, they even dream of a strong, vigorous, and promising man wooing and loving them, and how happy and glorious they are. If she marries a weak, incompetent, and unambitious husband, she will inevitably feel disappointed. If the sexual life that is essential in a marriage cannot be fulfilling, or if the husband has a hidden illness and cannot consummate the marriage, then the marriage relationship will be impossible to maintain, and where can love be found? Thus, all kinds of family tragedies are played out! Why are men weak and incompetent, with hidden illnesses? According to new medical theories, the most common causes are early indulgence in masturbation, untreated nocturnal emissions, early marriage and excessive sex, or unrestrained licentiousness, or worries and overwork, which damage the endocrine function of the reproductive glands. As a result, symptoms such as spermatorrhea, premature ejaculation, impotence, incomplete development, kidney deficiency, infertility, weak brain, forgetfulness, insomnia, palpitations, back pain, and neurasthenia are endless. Such men are not only difficult to be husbands and fall into miserable situations in life, but also will achieve nothing in their studies and careers, with a bleak and hopeless future, or even premature aging and early death! How critical is this!</p>
<p>If you want a husband and wife to be eternally loving and have a great future in your career, then abundant energy and guaranteed health are the only secrets. If a man is unfortunately suffering from the above symptoms due to early romantic encounters, he should seek thorough treatment as soon as possible. Do not delay, lest you make mistake after mistake. According to the case studies of world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, taking the gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal" is the most effective treatment for the symptoms. This preparation is made from the essence of the reproductive gland endocrine extracted from the bodies of strong animals, using an academic replication method, and the ingredients are completely preserved. Therefore, the quality is precious and the efficacy is certain, which is unmatched by any similar preparation. Taking this preparation will generate sperm and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate the blood in one day and night. Continued use will further regulate metabolism, promote development, and nourish the nerves. In a short period of time, all symptoms will be cured. Regular use in winter and spring will prolong life, rejuvenate and return to youth. Only those with spermatorrhea need to take the world-renowned anti-spermatorrhea medicine "Himit's Sperm Firming Tablets" to strengthen the sperm gate and stop leakage for even faster results!</p>
<p>Patient Gu Fuxiang, from Zhejiang, 25 years old, suffered from kidney deficiency, infertility, premature ejaculation, impotence, and nocturnal emission due to early marriage and excessive sex. At first, the relationship between husband and wife was still strong, but now it is gradually fading, and his wife has repeatedly expressed her intention to divorce. In order to fundamentally cure his illness, Mr. Gu went to the clinic for treatment. After examining his actual condition, he was instructed to purchase three dozen "Germinal" and two dozen "Himit's Sperm Firming Tablets" at the China and Western Pharmacy, and take them together. He also received new therapies such as electrotherapy and injections. In just two months, all his illnesses were cured, and he was happy and healthy. It is also said that his wife has had a dream of bearing a child.</p>
<h3>Beauty: The Most Ideal Remedy for Withered and Sunken Breasts</h3>
<p>— Yao Chongpei, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>All women have two major aspirations: one is to be as beautiful as a fresh flower in bud during their virginity, fragrant and sweet everywhere, and to be praised, "This girl is so beautiful," and as a result, marry a good husband. The other is that after marriage, they hope that the husband's temperament is as soft, fragrant, and gentle as spearmint gum, and that both sides have a deep affection for each other, and have several little angels jumping around them, living their happy days.</p>
<p>Such aspirations are certainly not excessive delusions, but to truly achieve such happiness, according to research by French gynecologist Dr. Vigny and Dr. Luxing, president of the American Baxter Hospital, the first thing is to ensure that the body is fully developed, and especially to ensure that the breasts are high and erect. Because breasts that can be high and elastic can not only form the most mysterious and lovely curves with the hips, making people intoxicated and admiring, but also because of the healthy function of the ovaries and the vigorous metabolism, the temperament is always gentle and supple, the muscles are plump, and the complexion is rosy and charming. If you can be so beautiful, there will naturally be many suitors, and choosing a good husband will not be a problem. Not only that, but from a reproductive point of view, these women, because of their healthy bodies, accurate menstruation, and gentle personalities, will give birth to lively, clever, and lovely children. On the other hand, those whose breasts are withered and sunken, whose hips are thin, and who have lost their beauty, not only suffer from many diseases and pains, and have no happy and healthy days, but also, in terms of appearance, are despised by men of the times, so that spring flowers and autumn moons, empty boudoirs and sighs, long nights and tear-soaked pillows! The bitterness in this is simply unspeakable to outsiders. However, in this era of scientific omnipotence, why don't smart ladies quickly use the animal ovarian preparation "Germinal" for women to save themselves? This preparation has special effects for treating breast atrophy, facial aging, and all women's hidden illnesses. After taking it, it can cultivate and nourish the ovarian function, invigorate metabolism, regulate menstruation, warm the uterus and stop leucorrhea in one day and night. If you continue to take it for a whole winter, even white hair can turn black and old age can return to youth. The development of breasts is a sure thing.</p>
<h3>Untreated Nocturnal Emission Will Harm Yourself and Others</h3>
<p>— Zhan Nianhui, Venereal Disease Specialist</p>
<p>The health of children is the result of parents' inheritance and education, while the health of young people and adults is the result of their self-care. Young people in the period of spring love, if they do not know how to take care of themselves, and commit bad habits such as masturbation, homosexual anal sex, and early marriage and excessive sex, which damage the sex nerves and loosen the sperm gate, then terrible nocturnal emission will follow. Once nocturnal emission occurs, the source of our life will be lost and cannot be stored. This is even more dangerous in this cold winter! "If you don't store sperm in winter, you will get sick in spring." This is common sense that everyone knows. If you think that nocturnal emission is painless and symptomless, and delay treatment, then brain weakness, forgetfulness, insomnia, disturbing dreams, back pain, kidney deficiency, infertility, premature ejaculation, impotence, and incomplete development will follow. Heroes are only afraid of illness, and this kind of young people, even if they have great ambitions, even if they have had a body of bronze tendons and iron bones, will also be depressed and disheartened. In this winter, they will feel cold hands and feet, and tremble from time to time. Colds and coughs are endless. How can students in school be diligent in their studies, so their grades will fall behind, or even drop out of school? Those who are engaged in business and industry will not be able to perform well and may even lose their jobs! If in the field of love between men and women, and in the sexual life of couples, there will be various tragedies such as losing love and losing happiness because of this. In today's society, there are countless such cases!</p>
<p>Young people with nocturnal emission who want to avoid harming themselves and others must seek thorough treatment as soon as possible. According to the case studies of millions of world-renowned doctors and my many years of experience, taking the anti-nocturnal emission medicine "Himit's Sperm Firming Tablets" (available at all Wu Zhou Hua Mei Pharmacies for a real price of two yuan per box) is the most effective and rapid. After taking it, it can consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, and have the effect of promoting sleep and stopping nocturnal emission that night. If you already have the above symptoms, you must also take the male animal gonadal hormone preparation "Germinal" to generate sperm and nourish the kidneys, strengthen the brain and activate the blood, nourish the nerves, and promote development. Continued use will definitely cure all symptoms and improve health in a short period of time. If patients can come to the clinic for new therapies such as electrotherapy and injections, they will be guaranteed to be cured.</p>

<h3>Current University Unified Entrance Examination Overview (1) - Ministry of Education Section Chief Huang Longxian's Overview</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Aviation News) Huang Longxian, Section Chief of the Higher Education Department of the Ministry of Education, recently wrote an article "Review of the University Unified Entrance Examination," stating the significance of the unified examination, reporting the outline of the method, explaining the process, and reviewing the examination methods, a lengthy piece of several thousand words. The original text is very long, so here is a selected excerpt of the outline of the method (the entire first paragraph "The Significance of the Unified Examination" is followed in its entirety) below:</p>
<p>This year's unified examination is roughly handled according to the precedents of last year. Last year's method is described in detail in the report of the National College Unified Enrollment Committee established by the Ministry of Education in 1938, so there is no need to report it one by one again. This place only explains a few important points and briefly describes the differences between this year's method and last year's method, so that the general public can understand the general situation of the handling.</p>
<p>(1) Organization of the Unified Examination</p>
<p>The organization of the unified examination is divided into two parts: the Ministry of Education establishes a Unified Enrollment Committee, which is responsible for planning and implementing all matters related to unified enrollment. Enrollment zones are established in various places, and enrollment committees are organized to handle enrollment affairs in each zone. Examination sub-offices may also be established when necessary. The powers of the Unified Enrollment Committee are to formulate enrollment regulations, stipulate the standards for question setting, grading, and admission, prepare unified test questions, interpret various enrollment laws and regulations, review examination results, and decide on the admission and allocation of students. The powers of the enrollment committees in each zone are to handle student registration, invigilation, and scoring, invite question-setting committee members to prepare a draft of test questions, review the qualifications and examination results of examinees, create candidate lists and various grade reports, and post the names of students admitted by the Ministry. In this way, we can know that the task undertaken by the enrollment committees in each zone is only to handle registration, examination, invigilation, scoring, create grade reports, and check the admission of students, while the important matters of formulating regulations, preparing test questions, setting standards, and admitting and distributing students are handled by the Unified Enrollment Committee of the Ministry of Education. However, the final decision-making power still rests with the Ministry of Education. In terms of personnel, in addition to separately designating the university president or director of education as the chairman of the committee in each zone, the committee members are all university professors, key officials, or important personnel from educational administrative agencies in the zone. The Unified Enrollment Committee has the director and counselors of the Ministry of Education and the section chief in charge of higher education as ex officio members, and the Ministry hires a number of university presidents and professors as members, designating one person as chairman. The organization of personnel can be said to be quite strict. This year's enrollment zones are divided into fifteen zones: Chongqing, Chengdu, Nanzheng, Kunming, Guiyang, Chenxi, Yanping, Guilin, Lanzhou, Enshi, Taihe, Yongkang, Qujiang, Zhenping, and Shanghai. The enrollment sub-offices set up in various places include thirteen places: Hechuan, Baisha, Leshan, Wugong, Ankang, Hong Kong, Tongren, Suoli, Lantian, Yishan, Changting, Longyan, and Yong'an. The distribution in terms of region can be considered very common.</p>

<p>The above unit of goods is 7500 pounds, and the currency unit is Rupee. Then, according to 0.9074 to convert to market picul, and according to this month's 9th Indian exchange rate of 100 yuan combined with 23.5 Rupee (that is, each Rupee is equal to 4 yuan, 2 jiao, 6 cents weak), then the selling price per market picul is:</p>
<p>Rangoon Rice Converted to Legal Tender Price Per Picul</p>
<p>The above price is calculated as: RS. ÷ (7500 × 0.9074) × $4, 26</p>
<p>At that time, the new rice had not yet been launched, so the price was more expensive; however, calculated at today's exchange rate, each market picul is only 14 to 15 yuan. With the new rice on the market today, the selling price in Rangoon must be cheaper than before, and there is no reason to rebound. That is to say, no matter how expensive the freight is, it will not reach nearly 40 yuan per picul. As far as we know, the freight from Shanghai to Rangoon before the war was only 11 to 12 yuan per ton, which is only 1 yuan, 1 jiao, 2 cents per picul. If we calculate a total of 5 yuan per picul, the selling price of Rangoon rice in Shanghai will not exceed 20 yuan!</p>
<h3>Analysis of Japan's Financial Strength (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Abstracted and translated by Zhu Shihui</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese War has lasted for more than two years. Whether Japan's financial strength can continue to maintain a long-term war is a question that we urgently need to answer. This article is an excerpt from "Japan's Financial Capacity for War" published in the September issue of Amerasia. The original author, A. Grajdanzco, objectively analyzes the strength and weakness of Japan's financial capabilities with reliable figures, which is quite worthy of our reference. Now, its general meaning is translated below:</p>
<p>In modern warfare, the abundance of financial resources on both sides of the belligerent countries, or the strength or weakness of their economic capabilities, is undoubtedly a primary factor in achieving victory. In this Sino-Japanese War, comparing the economic situations of the two countries, Japan is obviously in a more advantageous position, because her economic institutions had already been modernized before the war. At the same time, because the battlefield is in China, her many industrial and commercial cities have not been subjected to air raids and occupation, and her overseas trade has not been threatened by blockade like China. Her tax revenue has not been reduced by the war. As for China, its financial position during the war is not the same as before the war, because it has lost several important tax revenues before the war.</p>
<p>If we want to understand all of Japan's financial revenue and expenditure during the war, it is best to compare it with the budget for the fiscal year before the war (April 1, 1936 to March 31, 1937). Some people may say that Japan's budget for the year before the war cannot be regarded as a peacetime budget, because she had already embarked on the road of war preparations in that year. However, if we look at the comparative figures listed below in this article, we can understand that the budget for the 1936-37 fiscal year still has great increases and decreases compared with the budgets for several years during the war. We will now first compare the actual receipts and payments for the 1936-37 fiscal year and the 1937-38 fiscal year with the estimated budget numbers for the 1938-39 fiscal year and the 1939-40 fiscal year. Because this article is aimed at studying Japan's financial strength, it pays special attention to the analysis of the Japanese government's annual revenue, and only lists the various expenses related to the war and their percentage of the annual revenue in terms of its expenditures. The following table is a comparison of the Japanese government's annual revenues and expenditures</p>
<p>The expenditures on the army and navy in the above table include various expenses for conscription, military hospitals, wounded soldiers' recuperation, and military relief, as well as remittances from the military special account. (We do not know whether this fund has been fully used.) From observing the above table, we can discover one point: that is, the annual revenue for the 1939-40 fiscal year has increased fourfold compared to the annual revenue for the 1936-37 fiscal year. The Japanese government's annual revenue can be divided into the following four items: (1) tax revenue, (2) revenue from official industries and official properties, (3) revenue from public bonds and other loans, (4) miscellaneous revenue. If we take the various types of annual revenue for the 1936-37 fiscal year as the base number, we can obtain the growth rates of the various types of annual revenue for the three years thereafter as follows:</p>
<p>The attached wholesale price index and separately sold price index are as follows: (with 1936 as the base year)</p>
<p>From the above table, we can see that the ordinary tax revenue in the 1939-40 fiscal year increased by 6% compared to the 1936-37 fiscal year, the profits from the monopoly bureau increased by 12%, the revenue from official industries and official properties increased by 12%, and the revenue from business profit tax and income tax increased to 335%. Among them, the fastest increase was the government's loan revenue, which increased by 927%. At the same time, we can also see that in the 1939-40 fiscal year, apart from loan revenue and business tax income tax revenue, there was no type of revenue (miscellaneous revenue is an exception, because its nature is a combined number of various other revenues). The extent of its increase can exceed the extent of the increase in prices.</p>
<p>The growth rates of the Japanese government's annual revenues of various types are as mentioned above. Now we further list the amount of each type of revenue and its percentage of the total annual revenue:</p>
<h3>The Current Crisis in Japan's Foreign Trade (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Original Author: John Ahlers, Translated from Millard's Review</p>
<p>Japan is already encountering these difficulties, and the trade problems caused by the European war have not been resolved. Outside the yen bloc, Japan's trade with Europe accounts for 15% of its exports and 16% of its imports. A large part of this trade has now been lost. Imports from Germany, which account for half of Japan's total imports from Europe, have been completely cut off for several months. Whether the Soviet Union will place the Trans-Siberian Railway under Japanese-German control for large-scale transit traffic is a completely open question, mostly depending on the concessions Tokyo offers to Moscow as a reward. About six weeks ago, Japan negotiated with the European Allied Powers and obtained a firm guarantee that the Allies would not interfere with the export of industrial equipment from Germany to Japan by sea. However, this guarantee has since been invalidated by the Allies' decision to prevent all exports from Germany. The Allies, and even neutral countries including Italy, are causing Japan anxiety by not fulfilling many of Japan's orders for industrial products. Coupled with shipping difficulties, it is not surprising that Japan's imports decreased sharply in the first three months of the European war, forcing Japan to reduce the scope and extend the time frame of its industrial expansion plans.</p>
<p>Under the impetus of the European war, Japan's export industry is developing irregularly. The value of Japan's exports surged throughout September, reaching an unusual high near the end of September. However, in the first three weeks of October, it plummeted sharply, and then decreased further. Some of Japan's exports, such as those to Germany, have been cut off by the war. However, Germany accounts for only 2.5% of Japan's exports outside the yen bloc. This loss has been temporarily offset by a large increase in Japanese cotton cloth, glass sheets, and other commodities to Asian markets. The price of Japanese raw silk has soared, from 1,300 yen per bale in Yokohama to 2,000 yen, but then fell to 1,850 yen. Raw silk accounts for almost 80% of Japan's total exports to the United States, so the yen value of Japan's exports to the United States has increased significantly.</p>
<p>With imports decreasing and export values rising, Japan's trade balance with countries outside the yen bloc has improved significantly. In the first eight months of this year, the average monthly trade deficit was 60 million yen, while in October there was a surplus of only 2 million yen. However, this is only a temporary phenomenon that cannot be sustained, because (1) the last three months of each year are usually the most favorable period for Japan's trade balance, (2) Japan's imports from the United States will increase significantly in the following months, as large batches of newly placed orders to the United States will be fulfilled, and (3) the boom in exports of cotton cloth and glass sheets must be a flash in the pan. In the past two months, Japan's exports have increased because it shipped out old inventory. The main reason Japan was able to dispose of its inventory was the devaluation of the yen and the readjustment of the price levels of these commodities to suit foreign buyers. While exports of cotton cloth and glass increased, domestic production of these commodities continued to decrease due to increasing shortages of raw materials and electricity. The inventory of cotton cloth and glass will soon be exhausted, at which time these exports will cease.</p>
<p>Japan will again enjoy favorable export prospects due to the European war. This hope has already been realized, but the war in China prevents Japan from profiting from this possibility. In the past few weeks, Japan has received orders and inquiries from (1) San Francisco, Calcutta, Panama, Brazil, West Africa, Egypt, and Bangkok for canned food, dry food, machinery, rayon silk, glass, and porcelain; (2) Mexico for iron pipes, rayon fabrics, paper, and plywood; (3) India for 40,000 tons of bleaching powder; (4) Norway for 5 million burlap sacks. Those who issued these orders and inquiries all wanted to procure Japanese goods, but they had not previously imported these goods from Japan. However, a report from the Central Federation for the Promotion of Foreign Trade in Tokyo, which has this information, sadly states that the current position of Japanese industry has made it impossible to fulfill these orders. All of the foreign exchange funds that Japan can obtain are being set aside to purchase any kind of war material that can be obtained from the United States before January 26 next year. Japan is now unable to purchase foreign raw materials to manufacture more exports. The Tokyo Ministry of Finance continues to reject applications for additional foreign exchange for peacetime industries, and has even ordered further reductions in the foreign exchange allocated to peacetime industries for the import of raw materials.</p>
<p>The recent devaluation of the yen following the pound sterling is also a major problem for Japan's foreign trade. Most of Japan's exports are sold to countries whose currencies have also depreciated, with only a small portion of exports going to other countries encouraged by the yen's devaluation. On the other hand, most of Japan's imports come from countries that have not recently devalued their currencies. These exports are sold to Japan at much higher prices. The 15% devaluation of the yen automatically increases the value of the US dollar to Japanese importers by 18%. In recent weeks, Japanese economic newspapers have been talking about the fact that the domestic price level in Japan is higher than in most other countries. It has been several years since the recent sharp rise in world price levels is said to have readjusted the price relationship between Japan and the Anglo-Saxon countries, which is beneficial to Japan. However, the Tokyo government can only maintain this benefit if it can curb the continued rise in domestic prices in Japan and the depreciation of the yen. The Tokyo government has little hope of success in this regard, and the official regulation stipulates that prices must not exceed the level of September 18, but extremely important commodities such as silk cotton fabrics and rice have already exceeded this level. It appears that the domestic price level in Japan will continue to soar.</p>
<p>In summary, Japan's foreign trade is currently encountering unprecedented difficulties and obstacles. The Tokyo government has so far been unable to find a way to solve any of the urgent major problems of Japan's foreign commerce. Tokyo will mostly follow a path of least resistance, turning to its occupied territories in China for assistance, reducing exports of Japanese goods to the yen bloc area, and at the same time intensifying its extraction of any kind of raw materials or other supplies it can obtain in the territories it occupies in China. (The End)</p>
<p>The Past Week</p>
<h3>New Price Limit of Forty-Five Yuan</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Unscrupulous merchants are raising rice prices, and even Mr. Su Zuxun of the Rice Merchants' Association has publicly criticized them (see report in the 6th issue). From the announcement by the seven rice organizations to reorganize the rice trading procedures, one can also see traces of unscrupulous merchants disrupting the rice market. Public opinion is useless to unscrupulous merchants, otherwise they would not be unscrupulous merchants. The association's announcement is ineffective, otherwise it would not have come to this point! On the contrary, after this announcement was released, the price of rice rose even higher, reaching an unprecedented high of nearly 50 yuan per shi. All parties are eagerly looking forward to the concession authorities coming forward to impose sanctions and protect the people's food supply. Fortunately, all parties were not disappointed, and a solution came: the maximum price must not exceed 45 yuan! The common people have truly benefited greatly! However, the general capitalists are starting to worry, because they do not know how to protect the livelihoods of their employees! We hope that the Municipal Council will, based on this new price limit, issue a minimum standard for employee salaries!</p>
<h3>Japan's New Budget</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Japan's new budget for the next year totals 1.04 billion yuan, an increase of 100 million yuan over this year. With a printing press, there is no fear of running out of financial resources. With the Metropolitan Police Department and the Economic Police, there is also no fear of the people's resistance to strong control and high prices. The people's struggles and groans under malignant inflation can be locked up in prison so that they cannot be leaked out. An author in the "Japan Review" advocates sending prisoners to the Chinese battlefield, because he is worried about overcrowded prisons. However, the military strongly opposes this method, because anti-war sentiment in the army is already extremely high, so it is best to keep them imprisoned. However, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, etc., do not agree, because the panic about labor shortages is becoming more and more serious. Therefore, compiling a huge budget is indeed not a big problem, the problem lies in the fact that this will accelerate the process of the complete collapse of the entire Japanese economic system, and there is nothing to do about it.</p>
<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Rice Market Morale Drops After Price Limit Implemented, Hoarders Wait and See, High-Quality Rice Disappears, Traders Only Show Samples of Inferior Goods</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sources from the inland were still under the control of a certain party, the number was very small, and more than ten cars of Kuntai goods were transported back halfway, suffering great obstacles, and only four or five cars of goods arrived in the Sujia area. This time, the price of rice has soared continuously, reaching nearly 50 yuan. Although it is said that the source is blocked, in fact, the stock in the warehouse is abundant, and huge amounts of foreign rice are continuously arriving. The price of rice really has no reason to be so expensive. It is all caused by general hoarders and speculators. The Soybean and Rice Merchants' Association specially convened seven rice organizations to discuss at length and decided to impose price limits again. Yesterday, it has been announced that the price of japonica rice is limited to 45 yuan, foreign rice and Kejian rice are 38 yuan, medium and inferior rice are priced separately, and other goods are not included. Both buyers and sellers must abide by the rules from the date of the announcement, and must not privately violate them, otherwise, once reported and confirmed, they will be severely fined, and no leniency will be granted. Morale suddenly plummeted. Hoarders' goods, whose own goods are outside the price limit, are hidden and not sold. Traders also only show samples of inferior goods. High-quality japonica rice has disappeared from the market. Saigon and Kejian rice had previously been sold for around 39 yuan, and the overall trend is similar. As for those who come as guests, they dare not enter rashly. Therefore, yesterday's market was almost invisibly stagnant under the mutual rejection of buyers and sellers. Only some goods that are not subject to restrictions are slightly fought for in the market. It is estimated that the restricted goods that were opened include Kun japonica rice at 44 yuan and 8 jiao to 44 yuan and a half, Lisheng japonica rice at 43 yuan, Qing Si thin rice at 42 or 3 yuan, Fengjia early and late rice at 41 or 2 yuan to 40 yuan, and Saigon at 38 yuan only opened 300 bags, and Kejian rice at 38 yuan opened 500 bags. Those that are not restricted include Saigon broken rice at 35 yuan and 2 jiao to 34 yuan and a half, broken foreign glutinous rice at 35 yuan, broken Tokyo Jian rice at 36 yuan and 3 jiao, and 36 yuan, Jingwu broken rice at 36 yuan and a half, 36 yuan, and local Jian rice Wuyou Changbang Bianwuyuan at 44 or 5 yuan, Nanbang Yinyuan at 43 or 4 yuan, Lujian special rice at 43 yuan, Zhongshi goods at 42 yuan and a half, 42 yuan, and Yang Jian at 41 yuan to 40 yuan. The total number of transactions in the city was only more than 3,000 bags. The skyrocketing rice price has finally been able to ease the public's anxiety, but according to this price limit, although it can curb the endless rise, it is still too much for the average commoner to bear.</p>
<h3>Gold Prices Remain High Despite Sunday Holiday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the spot market for cash ingot was dull. Because it was a Sunday holiday, there were few transactions outside the market, and the trend remained firm. At first, buyers were willing to offer 4,190 yuan, but sellers had to ask for another 10 yuan on top of that price, making it 4,200 yuan. A small number of buyers with cash were willing to absorb the seller's asking price, and dozens of taels were traded. Later, because the two sides held each other off, no further transactions were heard until noon. The price of gold jewelry per tael remained unchanged all day. Data Tonghang still hung 425 yuan, and Xin Tonghang was the same as the above price, but the purchase price was reduced by about 15 yuan. Also, according to a London telegram on the 9th, the price of British pure gold was still fixed at 8 pounds and 8 shillings per ounce.</p>
<h3>New Qing Sugar Harvest Halved</h3>
<p>The trend of state-produced sugar remains tight. Yesterday, 200 bags of government red sugar were opened at 38 yuan, and more than 40 bags of Gongge red sugar were opened at 43 yuan and 8 jiao. According to a letter from Longxi, the harvest of this year's Qing sugar has been greatly reduced. It is estimated that the last harvest reached more than 200,000 dan, while this year's harvest is only 100,000 dan, which is half as much, due to lack of fertilizer. Therefore, it is feared that prices in the producing areas will not easily fall in the future. The Association's marked coarse white sugar has rebounded, with spot prices for coarse white sugar rising by about one yuan to 58 yuan, and re-export goods rising by another half yuan to 48 yuan. Taikoo granulated white sugar rose by 5 jiao, East Warehouse B mark was 56 yuan, West Warehouse was 56 yuan and a half, DY mark was 55 yuan, HX mark was 54 yuan and a half, and H mark car red sugar rose by one yuan to 40 yuan and a half to 41 yuan, and Dutch red sugar rose by one and a half yuan to 42 yuan to 43 yuan.</p>
<h3>Hainan Dried Longan Rises Another Three Yuan</h3>
<p>Hainan dried longan is rising because there are no continued arrivals, so although the goods in the hands of the brokerage firm have not been sold out, the intention to increase is still strong. The market yesterday also traded dozens of pieces, rising another three yuan to 130 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sophora Japonica Rice Rebounds</h3>
<p>Sophora japonica rice had previously been sluggish, and inferior goods had fallen to nearly 20 yuan. Recently, the stock has gradually decreased, and the sales have also increased, so the price has rebounded. High-quality goods are 34 or 5 yuan, and some are asking for 37 or 8 yuan, while ordinary goods are around 30 yuan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Silk Shipments to the US Sharply Reduced Last Month</h3>
<p>At the beginning of last month, when Japanese and American silk prices were actively soaring, the reasons for this were widely debated. To sum up, there are three points: (1) Japanese silk shipments to the US have sharply decreased, (2) Seasonal factors: According to past experience, silk prices are always at the highest price of the year between November and December, (3) The United States passed the Neutrality Act, which actually put the United States in the position of a belligerent country, and the domestic economic life had to deepen its impact. Regarding the first point, the New York raw silk statistics for November are now recorded for readers to study.</p>
<p>According to the above table, the New York market trend last month was not very tight, and both imports and sales declined. Although the inventory increased, the Japanese silk item decreased sharply by 14.893 dan compared with the import volume of the previous month, which is almost half of the total amount in November. The impact on the market is not small.</p>
<p>Sexual Hygiene</p>
<h3>Why Do Many Men</h3>
<p>— Russian Labor University, Sexual Dysfunction After Marriage?</p>
<p>In today's society, there are often many tragic divorces. Although there are many reasons for these tragedies, the main point is due to the inability to integrate love. Because the love between men and women must be forged from health, if you lose this healthy body, then no matter how superior your living environment is, it will be in vain!</p>
<p>To maintain our health so that it is not lost due to married life, the first question depends on maintaining virginity before marriage and avoiding self-indulgence. After marriage, it is even more important to practice restraint, so that the love between the sexes will not be ruined by a temporary lack of fertility. But if there is indeed a reproductive dysfunction, you must not avoid medical treatment. In addition to paying extra attention to reproductive hygiene, you should also use the most effective German youth glandular preparation for men, "Buti Kang", then reproductive power will return to youth, and love will always be new.</p>
<p>Although reproduction is a human innate ability, there are not a few cases where the sensory perception of sex becomes pathological, resulting in the loss of marital pleasure. In medicine, it is called sexual dysfunction, such as premature ejaculation, impotence, and the insensitivity that women often suffer from. Suffering from this is actually a symptom of one's own physical weakness. People over 40 years old, due to physiological reasons, the reproductive heat declines. This is because the youth gland that dominates sexual power changes from strong to weak. Because a person's sexual desire gradually disappears with increasing age, this is not only true for reproduction, but also for the spirit, skin, and other places. Now that we understand that reproductive health lies in the prosperity of the youth gland, the male hormone preparation "Buti Kang" invented by the German venereal disease expert Dr. Meulen is indeed a great invention of the 24th century medical crystallization. After taking it, the mind is clear, the spirit is invigorated, the complexion is rosy, the appetite is increased, and the reproductive function is very healthy, with no symptoms such as premature ejaculation or impotence. It can also promote reproductive function and help sexual organ development. It can restore the reproductive power of middle-aged people, nourish the brain, nourish the kidneys, and nourish the blood. It is a holy product for nourishing the old and the young. The female "Buti Kang" is a good medicine for regulating menstruation and treating anemia and breast atrophy. Especially for insensitivity after marriage, one dose of this medicine will make you more affectionate. However, young people suffering from nocturnal emission should also take "Nai Er Si Anti-Nocturnal Emission Tablets" in addition to "Buti Kang" to stop it, which is far more effective than sperm-locking tablets.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Chronicles</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea's Liberation</h3>
<p>— Written by Huang Zhongchang, MD, USA</p>
<p>In the history of medical progress in the 20th century, gonorrhea treatment is the most important. The most popular treatment at the beginning was the transmucosal sterilization method, but because gonococci are not completely on the mucous membrane, gonococci can be found everywhere in the blood, joints, etc. Therefore, this transmucosal sterilization method was completely declared a failure. The German medical doctor Peter made further research and used a special protein chromogen mixture to make a drug called "Kelinong". After taking it, it can generate anti-gonococcal bacteriophage in a short period of time, with the effect of anti-inflammation and pain relief. This effect can directly occur in the lesion, and can be called the only liberation treatment for gonorrhea patients.</p>
<p>Once a gonorrhea patient is infected by gonococci, it is like a poisonous scorpion on the body, and the pain is extraordinary. There are often absurd ideas of being tired of the world and committing suicide. And the most painful gonorrhea is no more than the symptoms of gonorrheal posterior urethritis. Because once gonorrhea enters the posterior urethra, it feels a lot of trouble. As the number of routes invaded by gonococci increases, changes also arise. If general transmucosal sterilization and chemotherapy are used, the bactericidal effect may not be able to withstand the gonococci, which are like mercury pouring down the ground and entering everywhere. This is why gonorrhea could not be completely cured in a short period of time in the past.</p>
<p>Now, because of the invention of "Kelinong", the treatment of gonorrhea is very different from the past. It has long been praised by doctors in Europe and the United States. According to Dr. Baisai Zhong's experiment at the venereal disease hospital he set up in New York, he said that in this hospital, no less than tens of millions of people have been treated for gonorrhea in the past twenty years. Before the invention of "Kelinong", it was very difficult to ask for a complete cure for gonorrhea. Only after the invention of "Kelinong", it is no longer as difficult as before to completely cure gonorrhea in all stages. Especially for those whose gonorrhea has invaded the posterior urethra, taking "Kelinong" can definitely cure it. The medicine is effective, and the results are excellent. In terms of external medicine, "Anti-Gonorrhea Water" is used to wash the urethra for men and remove gonococci. For women with gonorrhea leucorrhea, "Carter Xuedi Vaginal Tablets" can be used externally as suppositories to eliminate gonorrhea leucorrhea, which is more effective for all kinds of gonorrhea in men and women. It is also in line with the principle of family self-treatment.</p>
<h3>Colds Turn into Consumption</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>Patient Jin Zhenquan, 33 years old, the hometown was occupied last winter, so he fled with the crowd. At that time, heavy snow was flying and the wind was very tight. He felt cold and coughed endlessly. Because he relied on his strong physique and was distraught, he did not seek medical treatment. But since last spring, he suddenly felt a stabbing pain in his chest and had a lot of thick phlegm, so he took medicine for treatment, but it was ineffective. By last autumn, the consumption became more and more serious, with fever and night sweats. He came to me for treatment. I immediately ordered him to rest and take "Bufei Naer" internally. Mr. Jin respected my words and acted accordingly. In less than a month, the fever had subsided and the thick phlegm had gradually decreased. After taking it for more than two months, all the symptoms disappeared and he was as strong as before. He is now working in a company. The reason why "Bufei Naer" can achieve such miraculous effects is because its ingredients are purely refined, so it is by no means accidental.</p>
<h3>Effective Medicine for Treating Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>Nocturnal emission is indeed the most serious problem that hinders the development and health of young people. With the progress of modern medicine, the treatment of nocturnal emission has reached the peak of perfection. However, there are many patients who are confused by the propaganda of sperm-locking drugs with low efficacy, which delays the disease and wastes money. According to our experience in treating this disease over the years, the "Nai Er Si Anti-Nocturnal Emission Tablets" invented by German venereal disease experts are indeed extremely effective, because the ingredients of the drug mainly include sleeping pills to strengthen the brain and relieve the oversensitivity of the ejaculation center. Unlike other sperm-locking tablets that contain tyrannical ingredients to paralyze the sperm gate, not only may they not be effective quickly, but once the medicine is stopped, nocturnal emission will definitely break out again, or even become more severe. This is the same reason as using morphine to treat opium addiction. We, standing as doctors, hereby solemnly advise patients that those who have taken other sperm-locking tablets and feel that the old disease is difficult to cure, then "Nai Er Si Anti-Nocturnal Emission Tablets" are worth a try. After taking it, you can be sure that your mind will be clear, you will sleep peacefully at night, you will not have erotic dreams, and the sperm gate will be strengthened day by day. Nocturnal emission is cured, but at the same time, you should abstain from self-indulgence, and those who have kidney deficiency and neurasthenia should also supplement with the German testicular essence preparation for men, "Buti Kang", to strengthen yin and nourish blood. Taking the two medicines together has a special effect. In addition, what has been confirmed clinically.</p>
<p>Gonorrhea Symposium</p>
<h3>Effective Treatment for Stubborn Leucorrhea</h3>
<p>— Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic: No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<p>Once gonorrhea becomes chronic, because there are many changes and the bacteria are distributed everywhere, it is like a fire that has already spread, and it is quite difficult to extinguish it for a while. Because there are many of its followers and hundreds of changes occur, not only gonorrhea patients are shocked and surprised, but also doctors with insufficient experience and broad knowledge are often at a loss as to what kind of symptoms it is. As a result, gonorrhea is becoming more and more dangerous, and it cannot be quickly eliminated. It has become a stubborn leucorrhea that cannot be attacked for a long time or shaved away. At that time, gonorrhea patients already feel that their lives are in danger. If they still hesitate at this time, then the consequences of gonorrhea are even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>In patients with stubborn and most dangerous gonorrhea, systemic gonorrheal infectious gonorrhea is the most dangerous. Among systemic gonorrheal infections, arthritis and sepsis are the most dangerous diseases. Because the former can make the joints of the limbs become more and more inflamed, making movement inflexible, and resembling a disability. As for the latter, sepsis is caused by gonorrhea, and there is often the misfortune of causing life to collapse immediately. Therefore, in the case of such viruses, local surgical treatment must not be used to solve them, but the special medicine for gonorrhea "Kelinong" must be used to make the bactericidal power directly reach the lesion, and completely eliminate the gonococci scattered in the joints and blood. Because "Kelinong" can produce an anti-gonococcal effect in the shortest time after taking it, surrounding all the gonococci and killing them. On the one hand, it can assist the German anti-gonorrhea serum, induction electrotherapy, Wettere X therapy, which can eliminate the remaining toxins of gonorrhea and decompose the adhered joints, so that the movement is free. Even for gonorrheal sepsis, it can be saved. Clinic hours: 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM Every day from today, 20 numbers will be sent for consultation, and only 5 jiao will be charged for each number, and a complete book on venereal diseases will be given as a gift. It also treats syphilis, scrofula, chancroid, and sexual neurasthenia.</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Rise Again</h3>
<p>— Lu Lishi</p>
<p>This is truly an unprecedented event. During the harvest season, rice prices are soaring. In previous years, the rice price at this time would have been at most a little over one yuan per dan. Selling white rice for fifteen or sixteen yuan would have been considered rare. Therefore, everyone treated this issue of "food as the paramount necessity of the people" with calm indifference. But what about now? Thirty yuan per shi of rice, and you still can't get it even with money in hand. Is there a shortage of rice? Looking at the rice shops, the warehouses are piled high. And upon further inquiry, there is no shortage of rice stored in warehouses throughout Shanghai. So, why haven't rice prices come down?</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this. First, the sources are not ideal. Often, large quantities of "rice sources" are suddenly "detained" by someone. As a result, the market undergoes changes, and prices fluctuate unpredictably. Clever merchants will naturally fish in troubled waters. Therefore, the price of rice staying at its peak is to be expected.</p>
<p>Another point is the tactics of profiteers. Even though their own shops and warehouses are filled with goods, as soon as they hear that rice is being transported, they devise ways to compete for purchases. The more buyers, the less the rice price falls. As a result, the rice shop owners' pockets keep getting "makka, makka," while the poor ordinary people suffer. As severe winter approaches, which of the essentials—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—should be addressed first? I think, although the concession authorities and philanthropists attach great importance to this issue and try to find solutions as much as possible, all this is "laborious" like trying to get fish from a tree because this issue is related to the country's problems. There is only one method that we can work together to achieve, which can indeed be effective on the passive side, which is "saving rice." For example, if everyone reduces their daily ration of one sheng by one-tenth, eating eight he instead of one sheng, then the stomach will not necessarily remain unbearable. Individual families can thereby save on economic expenditure, and the "supply of quantity" in the entire society can also be reduced. In the past, eating rice costing twenty yuan per dan was acceptable; now, eating seven dou of rice costing twenty yuan is also acceptable. In this way, perhaps the major concern of people's livelihood can now be somewhat alleviated.</p>
<h3>Adding New Clothes</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>With rice as precious as pearls and firewood as expensive as cinnamon, clothing materials are naturally no exception to being cheap. The cost of a set of short woolen cloth shirts and pants is also seven or eight yuan, not to mention long robes. Usually, those costing more than ten yuan are already considered decent, but now a robe costing more than twenty yuan is still not presentable. A small employee's monthly salary is not enough to drape on the body. Therefore, they will not add new clothes unless absolutely necessary. This is a case of prices forcing you to be frugal.</p>
<p>But when you must add new clothes, you can't just focus on small calculations. One zhang and four chi of clothing material is enough. If you want to save five cun of money and only buy one zhang and three chi and a half, the tailor will not have enough to cut. By barely stretching the clothing material with surgery, making it and wearing it on the body, in less than two days, the clothes will shrink. After washing in water, they will become even shorter. Being greedy for small gains will lead to great losses. How utterly not worth it.</p>
<p>When cutting clothing material, you must not only cut enough, but you may as well cut five cun or one chi more. Once the collar or neckline is worn out, there is still extra material to resew a collar to match, because clothing materials have many patterns and colors, and you cannot buy them in stores. Even if there are, stores may not welcome small transactions of two or three cun. The hem is also easily damaged. Having more spare material for repairs provides peace of mind.</p>
<p>Although we don't have to be cattle and horses for clothes, we have to cherish such expensive materials at all times. When going out to negotiate business, it is necessary to take into account the appearance and examine the clothing. However, at home or in the office, when meeting with guests, just wear old robes or old cotton-padded jackets, or add a jacket that is easy to wash. Many Chinese middle-class people wear silk and woolen fabrics as everyday wear. After they are worn out, they raise funds to add new ones. This is really being a slave to clothes.</p>
<p>If it is a wool-lined robe, if the outer fabric and lining are broken, the wool cloth in the middle will not be broken. You can just take it out and replace it in a new robe. If one chi costs a few jiao, you can also save one or two yuan. Also, long robes that are broken at the hem can be cut and altered into short jackets. If the sleeves of short jackets are broken, they must also be altered into vests. With a small effort, you can contribute to the economy a lot.</p>
<h3>Idle Chat about Bridges</h3>
<p>— Shen Xishen</p>
<p>The construction of bridges is originally for facilitating transportation and developing traffic, so that people and goods on both the north and south or east and west banks, as well as all culture, can flow back and forth, benefiting the people and providing convenience to the public. This is common knowledge!</p>
<p>In the countryside of the Hangzhou-Jiaxing-Huzhou area, because the rivers and harbors are vertical and horizontal, and the Yongliu intersect, the bridges are not very numerous. Even if there are, they are not a few wooden logs or a few stone slabs. Most of them are very simple. Sometimes, due to the absence of a bridge, you have to make a big detour, wasting time and effort. This is the burden of not having a bridge! But in large cities, the situation is different. Look at the short Suzhou River in Shanghai, and there are several bridges! It is truly "pedestrians like shuttles, carriages and horses like dragons." The convenience of going back and forth and the benefits of traffic are far beyond what ordinary rural areas can match.</p>
<p>In general towns in the interior, most of them still maintain old-fashioned bridges: stone steps stacked into layers. Although walking is still convenient, it hinders the progress of the wheels. Therefore, some towns have demolished and rebuilt these bridges and rebuilt them into slightly inclined flat bridges so that the wheels can move forward easily and get the benefit of traffic.</p>
<p>The exquisite construction of new-style bridges is truly admirable! Cement and steel bones, stone poles and iron pillars, how strong they are built! The bridge surface is flat and wide. No matter what kind of grass vehicle, it can pass without hindrance. How great is the effect! This is the advantage of Western material civilization!</p>
<p>Writing this, I can't help but remember the north and south bridges that were related to the War of Resistance Against Japan. One is the Lugou Bridge in Wanping, Hebei, where the prelude to the national War of Resistance Against Japan was opened! The other is the Qiantang River Bridge in Hangzhou. This bridge has been built for a long time, and it has only started construction in recent years. The magnitude of the project and the cost of the project can be described as unprecedented in our country! And the relationship between this Qianjiang Bridge and the contribution to the traffic of several southeastern provinces in the future is naturally very significant! It was completed in the 26th year of the Republic of China, but unfortunately, the war broke out! And the great building, which was painstakingly managed and took several years, was destroyed overnight! This is really regrettable!</p>
<h3>One Week Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Hua Ying</p>
<p>In recent days, I don't know where a batch of shrimp came from. There are quite a few of them, big and small, and the price is not too expensive. So we can take this opportunity to eat some shrimp. The simplest way to eat shrimp is to grab shrimp. After soaking them thoroughly in good soy sauce, mix some fermented bean curd in it. It is most suitable for drinking or porridge. If you pay attention to hygiene and do not like semi-raw things, how about fried shrimp? If you talk about economics, you can't do without auxiliary products, such as braised shrimp with Hucong, braised shrimp with shredded bean curd, braised shrimp with shredded radish, and shrimp and eggs, which are all delicious. There is also a cooking method that uses rice wine lees to braise together. The freshness of the shrimp and the aroma of rice wine lees complement each other. And the rice wine lees can also be eaten. If you throw it away without eating, it is a waste of natural resources.</p>

<h3>General Wu Peifu's Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Yin Hong</p>
<p>Since General Wu Peifu's death and the sealing of the coffin, everyone has admitted that he is "the keeper of Eastern culture and the perfect man in Chinese history." General Wu's ability to be so respected and admired is, of course, due to the many respectable historical facts, such as "firmly upholding his integrity when trapped in heavy encirclement, remaining loyal and upright even when surrounded by treacherous and evil people, and not being subdued by power or corrupted by wealth," as stated in the Shin Pao editorial. However, at the same time, looking at General Wu's four major elements of daily life—clothing, food, housing, and transportation—he was also an honest, frugal, and simple person, and there are many aspects that can serve as an example for us. I will write them down later.</p>
<p>General Wu Peifu once dominated the political scene and was famous for a time during the early years of the Republic of China. However, although he held a prominent position, he was inherently firm, self-disciplined, and shared joys and sorrows with his subordinates. Therefore, when it comes to his clothing, in addition to the few sets of essential military uniforms when he was in office, he did not have any suits or fancy clothes. After being defeated and returning from the Battle of Tingsi Bridge around the 15th year of the Republic of China, he retired and closed his doors to guests, not caring about worldly affairs. As for the military uniforms he used to wear, it is said that there were more than a dozen of them, including the general's uniform, all of which were stored in boxes. Afterwards, he changed to wearing Chinese clothes, which he has used to this day without change. However, all of his clothing materials were made in China, and there was absolutely no non-domestic product. The same was true for his family members. As for Western clothes, General Wu never wore them in his life.</p>
<p>Regarding his food preferences, he can be described as "eating lightly and plainly." He personally liked spicy flavors, and almost every dish had to be added, probably because he was from Shandong! And he loved to eat "spicy eel" the most. The so-called "spicy eel" is actually the "deep-fried eel" that we Jiangzhe people eat. Originally, we regarded it as an ordinary food, but when we first put the live eel into the pot to cook, adding some chili peppers, the taste after cooking is indeed quite delicious. I remember General Wu once wrote a poem saying: "Proudly in the plate like a proud dragon, the fragrant and spicy green onion fills the air; after all, Wei Lang has many different flavors, and it is a great pleasure for a famous scholar to taste it," which is singing about his "spicy eel."</p>
<p>General Wu's hometown of Penglai County, Shandong Province, has an old-fashioned residence, which was built in the 13th year of the Republic of China. The house is not necessarily very magnificent, it is just like the private residence of a middle-upper class person. Because the location is limited, the three-entry courtyard cannot be said to have any pavilions and towers. After being defeated in the 17th year of the Republic of China, he once went to Sichuan, but soon lived in Beijing City. For nearly eleven years until now, he has closed his doors to guests all day long, enjoying his old age in a narrow room. It is precisely because of General Wu's integrity throughout his life that this house in Beijing was not built by him. It is said that it was the former residence of one of his old subordinates, specially given to him.</p>
<p>Speaking of General Wu's "travel," let's read his self-elegy couplet: "When successful, he had a pure heart, did not take concubines, did not accumulate money, drank wine and wrote poetry, still the true color of a scholar. After failure, he was stubborn to the end, did not go abroad, did not go to the concession, watered the garden and held a pot, truly returned to the field." From his "did not go abroad, did not go to the concession," we can know that he was a person with great integrity. His "travel," except for climbing the famous mountains and rivers of central China when he was once dominating the political scene, he had no interest in "travel." Since arriving in Beijing, for eleven years, he has not stepped outside the city, spending his days drinking wine and writing poetry as a pastime.</p>

<h3>Rotten Rice Seen at the Bottom of the Rice Warehouse / Frozen Corpses Found on the Road</h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhenshan</p>
<p>A series of clumsy military cargo trucks drove to the tall warehouse made of steel-reinforced concrete. The driver stretched out a hand and shouted loudly to the people in the warehouse: "Five hundred bags!"</p>
<p>"Here it comes!" A group of coolies rushed out of the warehouse door in response to this hurried shout, their strong hands tying a cloth belt around their waists.</p>
<p>"Come!" With a sound, a fully-loaded sack slid onto a shoulder, dragging a long and hurried cry, like a moan or a sigh, and quickly walked into the warehouse. The second person, the third person, and even the ninth and tenth people, were all busy connecting to each other, running back and forth, carrying on their shoulders.</p>
<p>I walked into the warehouse. A friend who accompanied me introduced me to a friend who was in charge of the warehouse. He guided us to browse. So I opened my eyes and looked: A burst of stimulation passed from the optic nerve through the brain nerve, like joy and hate! Those bags of rice were neatly and regularly stacked, from the ground to the roof, from the door to the dark inside, stacked upon stacked. The huge warehouse only had a church-style aisle in the middle, surrounded by rice. White powder seeped into the air, spreading and broadcasting the fragrance of rice.</p>
<p>Walking, walking, I strolled along, passing the window of a small accounting room. The telephone on the desk was ringing violently, as if crazy. The friend in charge of the warehouse picked up the receiver: "Hello! Oh! Three hundred bags, got it." He put down the receiver, turned around, and instructed a foreman-like person: "The second boss called and said that another three hundred bags have arrived and will be delivered at four o'clock." The foreman let out a burst of "Oh, oh!" in response, his eyes then shooting at the gaps in the rice pile. Perhaps he was planning the location of the stacking? I pondered secretly in my heart.</p>
<p>At this time, the telephone bell rang again like crazy. I had no intention of paying attention to it, just walking, looking, and a very naive question floated in my heart: "Hundreds of bags, hundreds of bags, only coming in and not going out, this warehouse may collapse one day? And outside this house, has anyone ever found a starving corpse?"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a cold air, carrying a strange smell, swept over. I lowered my head and stared: The bottom sacks were damp and dirty. I reached out and touched them again. My fingers felt like touching a fresh hairtail. I sighed at the rotten rice and bags, and said to that friend: "The rice here is already bad, isn't it? What a pity!"</p>
<p>"This outer warehouse is okay, the inner warehouse is even worse!" He said, leading us through an iron door into the gloomy and dark "inner warehouse." The rice was piled more fully than in the "outer warehouse." I reached out and touched the sacks. At least two bags at the bottom of each stack were already wet and rotten. My nerves were stimulated and tense, not allowing me to say polite words. I couldn't help but say to the friend in charge of the warehouse: "The rice price has risen to more than forty yuan. Instead of hoarding it here and letting it get wet and rotten, it is better to sell it. If you relax a little, those poor people who rarely get enough to eat will benefit a lot!"</p>
<p>"The boss doesn't care about this. He has plenty of money! Almost all the rice in this warehouse has doubled in price. Some of it was hoarded in May for eighteen yuan a head. What does it matter if a little bit goes bad? Anyway, it won't lose money."</p>
<p>"Then what price will they be satisfied with before they are willing to let go?"</p>
<p>"As a hoarder, there is no day to be satisfied. It is natural for others to starve to death, and it has nothing to do with the hoarders. Like me, I am in charge of the rice, but I can't afford forty-odd yuan a dan at home. I still use flour as food. It's really impossible to say." After speaking, he also shook his head and sighed.</p>
<p>I could only listen in silence, walk in silence, and smell the smell of the rice pile in silence!</p>
<p>Walking out the door, I bought a copy of the evening newspaper. Opening it, the headline of a news item read: "New hoarders are active, and rice prices are rising steadily." Turning it over, the headline of another news item read: "The authorities will suppress rice prices and plan legal sanctions against hoarders." On the way home, I looked back at the high warehouse like a beast, hoping that it would quickly die at the hands of hunters.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianrong</p>
<p>Chapter 18: Discussing Economic Prosperity and Old Market Customs / Narrating Matrimonial Plunder and Tracing Old Customs</p>
<p>Everyone agreed with what Zhu Ai'ren said. At this time, the train had passed Nanxiang and was approaching Shanghai. Shao Huihua had a home in Shanghai. When she arrived in Shanghai, she naturally had to go to the newspaper office to report on the duties that the museum had entrusted to her. On the one hand, she wrote special articles; on the other hand, she selected the photos she had taken; on the one hand, she delivered the documents she had collected, disclosing what could be disclosed and sending what did not need to be disclosed to the Department of Participation and Counseling for filing, and someone would take charge of it. Then she went home to entertain her mother, younger brothers, and sisters. Today happened to be Saturday. The Wu Junsu and Wu Junke sisters also had families in Shanghai, and they were still large families. As soon as they got off the train, they went home. However, in the evening, she had to go to Yu Dan Yun's place, which was what Dan Yun had instructed her to do. Or perhaps she suspected that she was looking for her to be a bridesmaid. But in recent years, Chinese weddings have often not used any male or female bridesmaids. Because marriage is not a mysterious thing, according to the old Chinese style of marriage, the bride is like a living dead person. She is not allowed to say a word, nor to smile. She can walk well on her own, but she has to be helped. And marriage is clearly a happy event, but the bride has to cry sadly. What is the reason for this? Regardless of the hot and stuffy weather, she is covered by a large square scarf, without a head or a brain, as if she has no face to see people. When acting as a bride, she is so cautious that she dares not pat herself when she is sore and dares not scratch herself when she itches. Isn't this too unfree? In the past, many brides got into trouble because they adhered too much to the old customs and were too reserved. Some died of suffocation in the sedan chair due to the hot weather. Some dared not escape because of a fire or a collapsing house. Later, the marriage was changed to a slightly simpler method, and it was already felt to be liberated and free. However, inheriting the remnants of the past, the bride is still as silent and unsmiling as before, and too reserved. Therefore, there must be bridesmaids to support her and accompany her, and the bride must be too shy at this time, even though she is very bold and free between weekdays. These things are inevitably somewhat contrived and close to pretense. Modern China does not allow those things that are close to pretense to exist again, so male and female bridesmaids in marriage ceremonies have probably been abolished. Not only that, but there are many simple marriages where you only need to register at the local marriage bureau. Whether to invite guests or not is up to you. Does it mean that those who invite guests are considered married and those who do not invite guests are not considered married? Some women wear a wedding ring on their hands, as if they belong to someone. But more than ten years ago, in Soviet Russia, they already looked down on that kind of wedding ring. They said: Is the love between men and women in these metal objects? (213)</p>
