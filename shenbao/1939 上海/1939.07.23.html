<p>社評</p>
<h3>晋省東南的戰局</h3>
<p>最近南北各戰場，大體都很沉寂。。雖經屡次傳述，日軍將有什麼新戰略、採取什麼新攻势；但表現於事實的，祇有粤東潮汕一隅的戰事。和晋省東南部游擊區的圍攻罷了。粤東方面，汕頭雖失守了多時，但與汕頭相距不出数十里的潮安澄海等地却又旋失旋復；至於汕尾，日軍登陸僅數小時就被完全擊退，可見日軍登陸不難，深入非易。即使到處登陸，也有什麼意義，無怪他們要揚言所謂「沿海游攻」的說法，企圖掩護他們無意識的盲目行動了。所以今後東南沿海各地，即使日軍繼續有何動作，結果大概也不過爾爾罷了。關於晋省東南的戰事。日軍在數旬以前，就已經開始對中條山一帶進攻，聲势浩蕩，結果却一無所獲；後来轉變目標。用一種更大的攻势，分丘九路，向太行山脈與沁水之間的一帶高地進攻。這樣的大舉圍攻，在日軍方面當然已經竭澤而漁。動員的兵數不下十多萬，可是旬日之間，被殲滅的已近萬数；同時日軍雖會陸續佔領了幾個城池，但不旋踵問又被華軍所包圍或收復。目前晋城（澤州）的形势雖十分危急；但同時其他軍事重要据點如董封鑷等處却確經華軍克復。可見戰役前途，日軍未必有何成績，所謂乘興而來，败興而歸，日軍進攻的結果，大約也是無待嘗龜的了。</p>
<p>日軍對晋省用兵，意義就在所謂「掃蕩」。為什麼日軍把南北各戰場的軍事進攻大多停顿起來，而專心致志在「掃蕩］山西這一隅？一則可見日軍師老兵敝，目前已無法各路並進：二則可見日軍對於山西一隅的用兵，認為非常急要，認為無論要保守華北或進攻西北，必須先肅清這一隅］。</p>
<p>我們試從頭說起：當去年三月間山西臨汾久陷時，北方的戰事在表面上好像已經告一段落；但是事實上非但戰事没有結束。反而使日軍更加寝不安枕起來。因為那華北的游擊戰爭，在前年十月底即已開始發動，幾個月來已經有了廣泛的開展，等到臨汾失陷的時候，軍事當局下令所有正規軍一律須留在當地擔任游擊戰爭；於是那臨汾戰役不啻替華北抗戰建立了一塊進程碑，從此華軍不必死守某一陣地，反而可以隨時隨地靈活的出動。截擊日軍，牵制日軍，使他們進既不能，守亦無方，一天天的坐耗實力，一天天的陷進泥淖裹去。日軍對於華軍的游擊戰，因為當初東北義勇軍的教訓，所以自始就心存戒懼，急求解決；尤其對於山西一省，更認為心腹大患，不可不首先療治。因為：第一，山西的地位據北方的中樞，地勢又居高臨下，如果山西一省不能確實控制得住，那末所謂華北的一切就根本無從談起。第二，山西在過去是北方各省區裏政治比較最有辦法的地方，最近又是北方游擊戰爭發祥的區域，非但由於山西的民氣發揚，游擊戰爭成績卓著，可以被北方各省甚至全國引為模楷；而且事實上北方的其他游擊區。若冀南，冀中，魯北，冀東等處，都是從山西游擊區擴張展延而成的，所以日軍認為假使不先解決山西省境內的游擊部隊，那末根本不是山西一省的問題，整個的游擊戰爭還有更蔓延滋長的可能。第三，山西省的地位又恰當黄河的曲盧，西指關中，南望鄭洛，山西境內的游擊部隊一天不肅清，日軍的行動就永遠會被牽制，也就是永遠會被關鍵在黄河的東北岸，無從向西進窺西北，也無從向南控制中原。有了這三種原因，所以日軍在華北的中心問題，目前還不在講求進取西北，而在進取西北前一步的山西［掃蕩］。</p>
<p>這一回的所謂「九路」進兵。事實上並不是日軍「掃蕩」西的第一次大舉。當前年十一月下旬華北游擊區還在開創的時期，日軍就用丁二萬兵力，配合若飛機大砲坦克，分兵八路圍攻晋察冀邊區，結果除自身有重大的傷亡舆損失以外，一點也沒有得到什麼。以後或是日軍圍攻，或是華軍出擊，大小接觸不知若干次，每次總是日軍有重大的傷亡與损失，同時却又給與華方游擊部隊良好的發展機會。在歷次戰役中规模最大的，要稱去年九月間日軍配合五萬兵力，十數路協同進攻五台山的一役。然而結果日軍傷亡兩萬。晋察冀游擊區還是屹然未動。在當時日軍的初意，滿想趁多數華軍盡力保衛武漢無暇他顧的機會，一舉摧毁華北的抗戰根據地。但結果未達目的反而殲滅了自己一部份的精銳。過去的事實如此，何況中國抗戰力量已經增強的現在，何況沒有武漢爭奪戰那種機會的現在，日軍更有什麼把握可使［掃蕩］計劃成功呢？</p>
<h3>英日成立初步諒解　準備津案正式談判　雙方將會同發表宣言　說明談判基礎及範圍　上次談話商定草原則經日內閣通過</h3>

<p>談判情形</p>
<p>（倫敦）泰晤士報今日社論謂日外務省昨所發表之公報、以東京談判氣象稍有起色為言、就此說察之、似星期日日外相有田所提出之各點、自英相張伯倫聲明不欲聽外國政府或軍閥之指揮改變共外交政策後業已修正、至少在詞句中已有變更矣同時華北時局中之事實二如華北日人之大佔優勢、華北主要都市在事實上之被日軍佔據、及日方所發華北外人租界的存在、不應危及日軍與親日派安全之要求、有予以承認之必要、假使日方指此為英國對於背景」之承認、則當有覓獲接近、俾在天津狹窄問題上作詳細談判之可能、英政府可不失其尊嚴、而給予租界中立之保證、並調查此項中立區域當局與中國淪陷區域內日軍間生活狀况之可能性、雖此種方式兌取不易，尤其是在日軍所佔領區域、始終未臻甯靜之時、惟外交技能、不致使此事終感困難、英國所可為者祇此而已、不能期望英國犧牲友人與原則、以助日本軍閥脫除其自己计算錯誤所惹起之困難也，同時日方現了解趨入遠東陷阱之危險、本報東京訪電會有「天津不過為世界戲劇中側面一小幕耳」一語、當日軍開始攻擊中國之初，已使遠東命運至少在三十年内不能在南京或東京決定之矣（二十二日路透社電）</p>

<p>英國態度</p>
<p>（重慶）此間中國當局刻仍研究東京談判之最近消息、眾料其將發表强硬文告、宣稱、英國之接受日方要求、若果属實、匪恃違反九國公約及國聯決議案之原則、且係極端短見之政策、因英國此舉行在遠東之英國利益與威望上有大不利之影響也、中國公眾、尚未知東京會談之妥協者、今仍相信英國不致對日妥協、但若華字報紙明日刊載全部事實時、則全中國將起對英愤懣之强潮（廿二日路透電）</p>

<h3>淪陷後之蘇州　商業異常慘淡　銀錢業幾全部停頓　刺繡物品無人問津</h3>
<p>蘇州通訊、蘇城本爲繁華區域、余閭十里、紙醉金迷、自淪陷至今、已一年十個月、全蘇商業沒落、一蹶不振、茲將最近商業情狀、略誌如决、</p>
<p>銀錢業</p>
<p>蘇城銀錢兩業、觀前街爲銀行集中地、中市街爲錢莊薈集區、戰前兩處、執商業中牛耳、自淞滬華軍西移、中中交農各行撒退、所留房屋、或被炸壊、或遭焚燬、最近「華興銀行、」就在江蘇銀行舊址、設立分行、錢業多數停業、至今歲七月上旬、有元裕。惠豐餘生·華豐·匯泰·通惠各家復業、每日須將貸出款項、報吿「僞署」、</p>
<p>銀樓業</p>
<p>蘇州銀樓一業、戰前本有百餘家之多、並有同業公會之組織、資本亦均相常雄厚、如恒孚·天成·天豐恒·老萬年等、資本均有十餘萬、每年營業、亦達十餘萬元、决等各號、資本一二萬元、營業亦有數萬元、淪陷時、天成被燬、其他各號、雖未燬盡、亦均被搶刦殆亂、各號損失、雞以統計、現在恒孚已經復業、其餘亦勉强支持、其營業祇有收進、得些薄利、籍維生計、售出頗少、各號資本並無一定、大都苟延殘喘而已、</p>
<p>繡業</p>
<p>本業爲蘇城著名者、如舞服·枕頭·旗袍·戲衣·用人工繡上各種花紋動物和風景等、故名聞中外、除湘繡外、常推蘇繡、戰前專營者、有間仁和·乾泰祥·大同·宏大·及湯家巷等數家、其營業頗爲發達、獲利亦大、銷路以京滬及南洋各埠爲大宗、每年達十餘萬、現在外銷不振、原料昂漲、而工資反减低、仍難暢銷、現除乾泰祥同仁和未復業外、餘雖從業、生涯實一落千丈、該業繡工、均爲小家碧玉、戰前約有一千餘人、近來交易遠不如前、雖减低血本、刺工低落、如枕頭前每對工資二元、現僅七角、亦無人問訊、</p>
<p>綢布業</p>
<p>現在觀前城內外、大小有百餘家、營業分兩種、一以絲織品爲大宗、如乾泰祥·同仁和·等各號、並兼營洋貨、一爲絲棉織品爲大宗、如協記·大有恒·協大祥·大豐等、兼有帶做絲綢者、其來源出自上海杭州湖州、棉布則常州無錫、在先蘇城有一種純經緞素緞、均爲著名物產、今已淘汰、戰後各絲織廠、雖有復業、惟所出品不敷應市、故各綢布業需貨時、均向上海批購、惟上海綢布疋頭、白身居多、資本較大者、悉染成帶下、資本小者、即批現成有色疋頭、以節省染費、惟價格均昂漲數倍、更兼運費捐稅、較戰前要加三倍以上、現在人民經濟困難·購買力少、加之同業競爭、故營業情形、亦甚困難、</p>
<p>絲業</p>
<p>絲業爲中國特產、出口蠶絲、向爲世界之冠、蘇州絲廠最盛時、有百餘家、其中資本雄厚、規模較大者、當推振亞蘇州延齡各廠、戰時延齡被燬、餘均爲小型家之格式、損失難以統計、現在雖有少數復業、大率仰賴上海綢業、近原料昂貴、均維持開支而已此外各業、　多清淡、</p>

<p>愛多亞路長耕里（泰晤土報東鄰）內、於昨晚八時二十五分左右、忽發生暴徒搗亂報館案一起、若輩並且挾帶武器、開槍達百餘發、無辜被傷者甚衆、殊引起兩租界深切之關懐、茲將經過詳情、紀述於后、</p>
<p>分僱汽車集中出發當昨晚八時零五分左右、靜安寺雲飛汽車站內曾有身穿靑布長短杉褲不一之男子、的二十餘名、佯作不識、分批前往租賃汽車、先後計達四起、因此該站曾亦先後以租照第一二三〇一號·第一二三○二號·第一二二九三號·及一二二三五號出差汽車四輛供應、若輩於租得汽車後、即囑車夫將車先後開往滬西億定盤路、在該處鄰近越界地段附近稍事停留、只見車中人上下忙碌異常、未幾即被命各車夫將車開往愛多亞路朱葆三路、</p>
<p>下車直衝中美日報各汽車夫當時尙不在意、因旣被僱用、當任指使、乃依命向愛多亞路而駛、比及朱葆三路附近、被命停車、暴徒等咸出車廂、即齊向長耕里一百三十號屋內衝進、査該屋中乃大晚報館與中美日報館所在、若輩進屋後、即由三名身穿靑布短衫褲之男子領前、向三層樓中美日報進襲、而若輩挾武器、如盒子槍·手槍·手溜彈·等、亦均齊挾手中、勢將實行其搗毀企圖、正値千鈞一髮之際、適有中美茶役步達梯端、瞥見來者成羣結隊、且有武器、知事不妙、乃亟先將梯端要門緊閉、</p>
<p>進襲中美目擊者談據當時目擊者談、在暴徒進襲中美日報時、會見若輩中有爲首之三男子、身穿黑香雲紗短衫褲、頭上均戴白草帽、手中各挾木壳槍、待該報茶役將梯端門戶緊閉後、若輩即開槍、當時即見一身穿西裝之男子、變手各執一槍、爭前呼嘯、此外另有一人則手執紅旗、揮舞指導、一若發號施令者然、</p>
<p>大晚報館工友受傷</p>
<p>若輩見事敗露、遂即向梯端開槍、於是羣槍齊發、咸向梯端轟擊、頓時彈如聯珠、宛如戰地、但梯門終未被啟、若輩見事不成、而瞥見大晚報之排字房門戶洞開、逐轉道而向大晚報之排字房實行搗亂、並連續向內開槍、因此曾有大晚報之排字工友王錫文·顧新泉·等三人當塲受傷、當斯時、公共租界法租界兩警務機關已經得報、而長耕里附近、亦已人聲鼎沸、鬧得天翻地覆、崗捕警笛聲亦四起呼應、故瞬息間兩租界全副武裝探捕、已經畢集、</p>
<p>暴徒奔出迫車疾馳肇禍者耳聞外間聲息、遂先後退出圖遁、及待奔出長耕里、亟向四面散奔、但法租界探捕已將朱葆三路等阻塞、而公共租界探捕亦早將西首去路攔住、並集中火力、對準暴行者進擊、各暴徒狼奔豕突竟向東逃、且戰且竄、比至四川路附近、其中數名、仍躍入照會第一二二三五號汽車、勒令車夫速往北開、待至漢口路口、又命折往西行、當時該車夫早已洞悉所遇、但被武力所制、無法擺脫、遂祇得任憑若輩擺佈、然在此極短時間內、該段地帶內之槍彈聲、已屬無從辨別、彈如雨下、足爲當時寫象、而無辜受傷者、巳屬比比皆是矣、</p>
<p>中途被阻開槍拒捕及該第一二二三五號圖遁汽車循漢口路向西在飛、將近浙江路口時、適遇老閘捕房第一五六號西捕率同第一〇七九號·一一四四號·及一八六九號·三華捕奉命搜査行人、巡及該處、而愛多亞路之事件、亦早有所聞、因此盤查益嚴、忽見該車如飛而至、立即將其攔阻、並喝令停車、該車夫正苦無法求援、耳聞斯命、立即停車、並乘勢躍出車外、但座後各暴徒、亦早有成算、見探捕由後面趕來、遂又拔槍、憑後座玻窓向探捕連發三槍、幸未被中、於是探捕亦起還擊、激戰又起、</p>
<p>棄車奔逃彈如雨點各暴徒見情勢急危、惟恐生擒、即在紛擾中棄車而逃、沿途尙開槍拒捕、因此老東方與淸一色轉角間、叉成槍彈橫飛之所矣、結果若輩竟將槍彈等沿途拋去、雜於人叢中逃逸、故待事後經兩租界嚴密搜查之下、發現手溜彈等甚多、而傷者亦纍纍、均經分別送往各醫院救治、探捕等幾澈夜不眠、協力從事追尋綫索、救護車更應接不暇、來往救護、而當塲曾協力追踪逸犯、因而發槍之華捕、亦達數十名、足徵斯案之嚴重矣、幸手溜彈尙未爆炸、、</p>

<h3>外匯劇變之結果　各業再度漲價　無關外匯各業無甚關係　實爲提倡國貨之好機會</h3>
<p>本市物價、近劻外匯之猛烈緊縮、愈見上漲、允以舶來品各業、因匯率變動、多再度漲價、市民生計、益感受威脅、茲分誌各情如下、</p>
<p>各業漲價一瞥據記者調査、最近公吿繼續漲價，計有翻砂廠業·玻璃車邊打花業·汽車材料業·出租汽車業·等、均繼續漲價、（一）祥生·雲飛·泰來·銀色·各汽車公司、定本月二十五日起、增加車租、計起碼每二十分鐘價一元八角、每小時五元四角、（二）大陸綢布深廠照原價增加五成、（三）機製煤球廠業前經規定煤球每擔不得超過二元二角、因煤層來源成本加重、聞將重訂新限價、惟公會尙在竭力調節、（四）美孚行汽油、由邦浦出貨、每美加侖二元、每對裝五美加侖聽兩聽二十四元五角、每箱裝五加侖聽兩聽二十六元、亞細亞火油公司殼牌汽油、由邦浦出貨、每加侖一元、五美加侖聽裝每聽十二元二角五分、（五）經綸廠雄鷄牌毛巾重訂新價、（六）公大玻璃廠各貨再漲二成、（七）中和汽車材料製造廠照六月十二日定價一律再加百分之二十五、（八）五金業同業公會昨公議市價、大致各貨均上漲百分之四五十、允其是管子鋼鐵兩項、格外上漲、聞業已印就各貨價目表、分送各會員號以資遵循、</p>
<p>交易限付現鈔各業復因外匯變動、原料成本加重、爲顧全成本　如煤業木材業等、昨起均實行現金交易、（一）煤業公會緊急通告云、邇因外匯一再暴縮來源各貨、因之成本飛漲、同業間買賣、均需現金交易、各廠商及用戶、承蒙賜顧者、必須先付現金而後送貨、諸希鑒原、（二）木材業同業公會通吿云、茲因時値非常、外匯變動、來貨成本日益昂責、本業爲顧全血本、議自本月二十二日起、所有各貨、一律現款交易、收付以法幣爲限、諸請各客戶願諒、因各業之不論零整交易均須付現鈔、因此市上法幣頭寸、更感短少、</p>
<p>洋貨業大影響因外匯之暴縮、一般舶來品、旣非通常市民所能享受、各國在滬洋商、營業遂趨銳减、而洋貨販賣商人、亦同受打擊、記者會向各著名時裝商店訪問、得悉營業大非昔比、因歐美貨之呢絨嗶嘰、均漲至戰後一倍以上、添製新裝、顧客已爲之大减、叉各大公司之洋貨部營業額、亦大見减少、至歷來販運洋貨至內地之販運商人、打擊允甚、幾瀕於停頓、且據目前情形觀察、此種趨勢、尙在繼續演進中、</p>
<h3>米商散放漲價空氣　變相超越限價　外匯暴縮與國米無關　風雨期已過到貨必旺</h3>
<p>本市公共租界各米號執照、按照規定每半年換領一次、現屆二十八年下半年換照之期、特由米號業同業公會造具淸冊兩本、計米號四百零五家、內蘇州河南者二百七十九家、蘇州河以北者一百二十六家、均備具執照費及難民捐、轉由市商會送請公共租界捐務處發給執照矣、</p>
<p>本市國米市價、經租界當局再度訂定限價後、已漸趨穩定、但日來因匯價緊縮、各種舶來品上漲、一般祇顧私利不顧大局之米商、不免眼紅、復乘機</p>
<p>抬高米價中决各貨、一律漲近限價、且將常熟白粳頂貨收藏、而將决貨冒充、仍開最高限價二十元、並散放空氣、謂當局將開放限價、據新新社記者探悉、（一）外匯暴縮、在此不需要洋米之時、對食米並無關係、與國米更風馬牛不相及、（二）藉口存底减少、欲抬高售價、</p>
<p>自欺欺人蓋在此靑黃不接之時、每年均有此現象、而木年存底、除棧存尙有三十萬餘包、米店內棧及市民存貨亦多、據各方佔計、至少足供三個月之需、（三）各地來源近雖因風雨所阻、到貨校少、但天氣轉晴、到貨必旺、（四）照目前當局所訂限價、米商除去成本及一切開支外、均</p>
<p>可獲盈餘故各界深盼租界當局、在此金融風潮澎湃之時、仍本過去宗旨、在顧全米商利益安定人心之原則下、切實厲行限價、拒絕放價要求、並派員密查變相之暗抬售價、减輕市民負担、而安社會秩序、</p>
<p>昨日米市成交五六千包、均係中决各米、並聞在市塲以外、竟有將頂特頭號各米、私自超越限價出售、租界當局爲執行限價起見、如買賣雙方、無論整批與零售、有超越限價者、概不認爲有效、並望隨時報吿捕房以憑取締、</p>
<h3>錢業公會　委員會議　商討對內問題</h3>
<p>錢業同業公會所屬之聯合準備庫、自各莊遵部令集中票據、授權該庫、負責向銀行票據聯合準備庫辦理往來手續後、對內對外工作、於是驟形忙碌、事務特殊滋繁、昨日下午二時、在寗波路會所又舉行執行委員會議、出席者計有該庫總經理陳竺珊·及秦潤卿·張夢周·斐雲卿·王懷廉等十餘人、由陳竺珊主席、葛槐淸紀録、除由主席報吿庫務及集中票據後未盡事宜外、並討論拒用華北地名鈔票及各莊鞏固準備金之對內等問題、至三時許、始吿散會、</p>

<p>證劵回漲</p>
<p>上海證券暗市、前因投槪營外滙黃金、以致統一各債價格慘落、今因外匯轉鬆、黃金回跌、同時財政部對七月底到期之本息、雖聲明停止還本付息、而中中交農四行確已允貼現抵借、惟上海以及各埠則分六期抵偕、所以昨晨價格回漲甚烈、上午收盤、甲種五十二元零五分，漲三元零五分、乙種四十四元、漲二元五角、丙種四十三元、漲二元一角、丁種無成交、戊種四十二元八角五分、漲二元三角五分、惟與前日下午暗市中之暗盤比較、則反跌數角、</p>
<p>黃金回跌</p>
<p>黃金暗市、因投機者之操縱、以致曾創四千六百元之新紀錄、昨晨開做後、仍不脫混亂之局面、初跌至三千元之低盤、旋因日商銀行續扒外滙、以致黃金價格回漲、上午收盤三千四百七十元、比較前日跌落九十五元、下午星期六例停開做、銀樓掛牌大同行初爲三百六十元、旋爲三百五十元、新同行三百四十八元、聞黃金暗市之價格上落、如此猖獗、全係投機者之操縱、允以錢兌業之操縱爲最甚、某某等莊以投機黃金爲唯一之營業</p>
<p>貼水低落</p>
<p>欲投機黃金外匯等交易、必須需要鉅額鈔票、所以在投機事業勃興之際、滙劃貼水、勢必飛漲、滙劃貼水雖爲政府所取締、惟各小錢兌莊祗知自己之利益、不顧政府法令、依然經營、咋日因外匯轉鬆、黃金回跌、匯劃貼水稍跌爲二百零五元、至於天津市塲之外匯、竟隨滬上黑市而緊縮、聞昨日天津外匯行市、英匯三便士一八七五、美匯六元二五、申匯一百四十元、即上海交款一百元、天津應收一百四—元、</p>
<p>投機危害</p>
<p>新聲社記者作向銀行界探悉、上海金融界對於應付環境、已煞費苦心、奉行政府命令、猶力行不懈、惟投機者竟不顧政府戰時金融政策、祇知牟利、一再操縱、以致造成今日之上海畸形局面、現政府方國對上海金融市塲、在可能範圍以內、仍予設法維持實非易事、惟因淪陷區域之上海、爲政府權力所不及、以致取締投機、有所困難、但望投機者站在國家立塲、自行覺悟、</p>
<p>外匯維持</p>
<p>關於市場傳平準外匯基金委員會允維持黑市外滙問題、新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、上海之外滙黑市、平準委會始終予以維持、惟爲防止套買外匯起見、不得不予巖格限制、否則恐與天津情形相同、英匯縮至四便士以內、又外傳財政部對維持上海金融有新訓令說、經記者分向中·中·交·三行、以及各團體詢問、難以證實、至於中交兩行收兌天津地名之鈔蔡、仍在繼續兌換中、迄未得總行之指示辦法、</p>
<p>交易現鈔</p>
<p>自上海黑市外匯緊縮後、進口貨物之成本驟高、於價格、一致飛漲、各項交易、因滙劃貼水高漲、改用現鈔、（一）美孚亞細亞汽油、通吿今日起改訂新價、由帮浦出貨、每美加侖漲爲二元、（二）煤業同業公會通吿、同業間買賣均需現鈔交易、（三）木材業同業公會通吿、昨日起所有各貨、一律現款交易、（四）翻砂廠業同業公會通吿、再度漲價、（五）玻璃車邊打花業公會、通吿改訂價格、</p>
<h3>新起兩颶風　其一將撲東京　第一颶風已消散流竄　本埠溫度昨踰九十度</h3>
<p>太平洋中颶風接踵而起、最近新起之兩颶風、其一已化為旋風、其一有進窺日本趨勢、大通社記者茲錄如左、</p>
<p>第一颶風　消散流竄</p>
<p>徐家匯天文臺探悉、太平洋新颶風、其第一颶風於前日下午二時進抵北緯二十四度、東經一百二十度、的在福州厦門附近登陸後、昨日午後據天文臺報吿、此一颶風有散爲旋風、流竄至臺灣島附近之趨勢、但已無足重視、</p>
<p>第二颶風　方向急轉</p>
<p>太平洋第二颶風、據徐家匯天文臺報吿、於昨晨六時、進抵北緯二十三度、東經一百三十二度之處、方向轉正北、嗣據天文臺於午後二時報吿、颶風已進抵北緯二十五度、東經一日三十三度之處、方向轉爲北北東、</p>
<p>趨向東京　滬可免襲</p>
<p>太平洋第二颶風、照昨日午後所報吿、進行方向、目前雖距離尙遠、惟正對日本東京進襲、同時當日前颶風襲擊本埠時、日本氣壓頗高、近日突然下降、與江浙氣候相伯仲、故殊有被襲可能、江浙沿海、則可避免矣</p>
<p>昨日溫度　踰九十度</p>
<p>本埠自二十日颶風在上海西面掠過後、前日起天氣即轉晴、惟氣溫則殊低、比及昨日、溫度復又趨高、據天文臺紀錄、昨日午後三時前之最高溫度、爲九十度零半、最低溫度爲七十三度四、已較前數日爲炎熱、又浦江高潮自今日起、可漸趨平復、</p>
<h3>新滙劃　通行市面　隨時審査担保品　檢委會即將開會</h3>
<p>上海銀行聯合準備委員會於七月四日起、開始辦理同業匯劃領用事宜後、各行莊已陸續提供担保品向該會領用同業匯劃、該會之房地產證券股票貨物等三股評價委員、已由主席委員錢新之·貝淞損·唐壽民·指定之代表、分別開</p>
<p>評價委會</p>
<p>隨時審査評定價格、並依照許價額百分之七十領用同業匯劃、今因新匯劃制度收效、因此行莊領用者激增、總額規定爲五千萬元、關於是項担保品秩保管、另由保管委員會保管治、並匯劃</p>
<p>準備檢查</p>
<p>委員會、係由市商會·銀錢業公會·洋商銀行公會·暨中中交農四行等五團體合組、委員推定後、即將開首决委員會議、實施檢查公吿，以昭大信、並山該委員會正式函聘潘序倫會計師爲會計顧問、又各行莊所存準備會庫之二千二百萬元</p>
<p>匯劃頭寸</p>
<p>經中中交三行允於七月四日起、分十二個星期掉成法幣、以資週轉後、每星期的一百八十萬元、業已掉出的五百五十萬兀、所以市塲上已增加法幣籌碼、</p>
<p>一元基金運動</p>
<p>本市難民習藝所、自成立以來、瞬將兩載、曾先後設立木工玩具刺綉洗衣毛巾漂染紙盒編織肥皂機縫等工塲、爲使其餘難民得習他技之長、將來獻身社會起見、故決絡續添設手套印刷織襪等工塲、因缺乏基金、無法舉辦、故經董事會議決、組織一元基金運動委員會、請求各界捐助、俾使難民生產事業、得以永久維持、凡捐款五元以上者、送謝狀一張、一元以上者、送感謝章一枚、現已開始勸募、</p>
<h3>假日商工廠名義招工　誘脅華工充兵役　三個月後即行調往僞「滿」　華工洞燭陰謀咸不願入彀</h3>
<p>大光社云、日方自侵華以來、瞬已兩年、在此兩年之中、經國府實施長期抗戰之現定政策後、予日方戰時財政瀕於破產外、而其侵華之兵額、亦死傷慘重、致國內常備軍已大爲减少、現每决調遺來華之日軍、大部份係屬强募之壯丁補充、近且僞「滿」與外蒙衝突、日趨嚴重、則日方益感左支右絀</p>
<p>無法應付</p>
<p>是以日方在內地、憑藉其特殊勢力、拉去我方靑年壯丁及苦力等、施以訓練、充仟僞軍、以担負後方兵員之不足、上海方面、日方以虹口日商工廠名義、招募工人、並以每人每日工作可得一元五角</p>
<p>報酬利誘</p>
<p>白渡橋彼堍設置臨時招接所、招接所前停有卡車、凡額滿一百者、即開入虹口、迄已兩日、因一班華工、雖貧無立錐之地、明知日方陰謀、均不願入彀、但受惑而被朦蔽者、已達二百餘人、據大光社記者探悉、日方在上海及內地所誘募之</p>
<p>青年華人</p>
<p>一經遺往虹口後、即失去自由、在日方壓迫之下、被强載靑島、從事訓練三個月兵役、挑選精壯者、調往關外僞「滿」服役、其餘擇支配各地、供日僞驅策、毫無生還之望、</p>
<p>新四軍痛剿　刦諸翟鎭股匪</p>
<p>市西諸翟鎭、於前夜被持械股匪洗刦、茲悉當該鎮被刦之夜、適新四軍開到離鎭數里之某要隘、行裝未卸、聞警即會同忠義救國軍徐部、派隊跟踪進剿、當於虹橋飛機塲西北某村遭遇、即將該匪包圍、力加壓迫、匪衆頑强抗拒、雙方交戰、槍彈密如聯珠、黑夜交鋒、淸晨始止、卒以匪徒力薄、潰退鳥散、當被新四軍暨徐部擊斃土匪四十餘人、生擒五名、奪獲快槍盒槍五十餘支贓物衣料布疋多件、但士兵陣亡者、亦有十餘人、生擒五匪、嚴加盤詰、內有兩人、原係當地良民、被脅拖累、經證明後、即令保釋、其餘三匪、供認搶刦不諱、立即梟首處决、明正典刑、</p>
<h3>鄧本殷率部　反攻蘇錫　滸墅關一役　日死傷慘重</h3>
<p>前瓊崖鎭守使現任江南遊擊軍總指揮鄧本殷、自接奉中央新任命後、即親赴京滬綫一帶指揮各軍、並率梅朱兩部先從肅淸各鄉區匪盜、以安人民生息、同時向沿錢如滸墅關東橋黃埭等處、襲擊日僞軍、殲滅甚夥、並獲小鋼砲輕重機關槍步槍等戰利品、據無錫來人談、鄧氏在沿京滬綫指揮作戰之游擊部隊的三萬餘人、本月中滸墅關之役、日僞軍之死傷人數達一百四十餘名、華軍犧牲亦頗鉅、現所部已分任反攻無錫蘇州崑山三縣之準備、聞當地駐防之日僞軍、頗爲惶慮、</p>
<h3>鮮豬業將　全體停業　豬隻來源　悉被壟斷</h3>
<p>自日僞「牲畜市塲」非法壟斷鮮豬來源後、全市鮮豬行鮮肉店攤等、會一度發生僞秤僞市、旋經兩租界當局竭力勸導後各行店忍痛復業、一面派員向工部局公董局請願結果、當經當局分別提請法國駐滬領署及各國駐滬領團商討後、再行答復、但此案迄今已越兩月、尙懸而未決而僞「牲畜市塲」之統制計劃、决第實行、鮮豬來源、可謂全被龍斷、豬販方面、亦不願販運、是故全市鮮豬行商、因此種種原因、無法交易、將一律停業、以靜候租界當局之妥善解決、</p>
<h3>女工頭（上）</h3>
<p>— 丁文琴</p>
<p>法租界賈西義路，開着一個中國製針廠（俗名引綫廠），廠裏有一個女工頭，這便是我了。每當放工離廠，鄰廠的人物，往往很關心的說：「這是頭腦，」「是那摩溫呢，」我也不暇聽她們的爭論，並且，我也沒有什麼意見，那一個名兒來得好聽。總之，我覺得，我在慢慢的像起來了，我很樂意</p>
<p>「無論什麼大小事情，祇要盡力的幹，沒有不會做得好的。」這是一位老師給我的敎言，我對這話發生了信仰，並且產生出力量，增加了我的勇氣，於是我就大踏步的走入神聖的工人隊裏。許多親戚朋友們的贊美，　譏，和惋惜，從我的左耳朶進去，但是我立刻讓牠們從右耳朶出來。我自己寗願脫去紗旗袍，丟下高跟鞋，而以藍布袍子一件，布鞋一雙，圍身一個，和眞誠的她們共工作，共飲食，共閒話，自己精神痛快，還要顧些什麽呢？</p>
<p>這普遍而不爲人所重視的針——不知道有幾許金錢爲牠而流到海外去，從一根鋼絲被鍛鍊成一枚使用的針，中間經過十餘决的手續，而每一步的手續，又是那麼的麻煩，簡單的說來，就是搓條，磨尖，磨中，榨鼻，穿孔，切鼻，煙火，小硏磨，大研磨，磨小尖，齊針，一直到掃光——磨亮，至此，一枚精亮光滑的針成功了。以後包裝等等，便是女工的事了。幾十個女工分成若干小組，每組裏有一個人專任配針之責，她把包針紙一張張的排好，再墊以錫紙，然後取兩板銅板斜着向已經置在紙斗裹的針中一揷，（銅板的一面刻着許多的凹槽）再輕輕的往上一提，一枚枚的針就乖乖的躺在銅板槽裏，如此一包包的配，其餘的人舞動着玲琍輕捷的手指，一包包的長方形的針，就從她們的手出來了。號頭配齊後，就得大包裝桶和裝箱，現在的商標，有中國，雙喜，標準，和佛手等名目。針號從一號到十二號，還有出號針，　（就是比一號還大）如2＼03＼0和5＼0等我們每天工作十小時，從上午七時至下午六時，中午有一小時的餘暇。快手每天能包三四千包，頂慢的也能超出二千包，廠方除了發給規定的薪工外，還依着包針的速度另給獎金，所以祇要勤奮的工作，每月得三四元的獎金，簡直不算怎麽一回事。</p>
<p>雖然，我們整日的工作着，然而我們的精神却是愉快的，因爲廠裏尙職工打成一片，絕無階級之分，上自廠長經理，下至茶房廚子，吃的都是饅頭，喝的都是高粱茶。聰明的朋友，也許已經看出另外一件事來，是的，我們廠裏同事除了在上海所招的女工外，都是山東籍。因此，有許多同學們知道了，都寫信來問我：「阿×，你的國語快山東化了吧！」我非但不躭憂這一點，而且我極願意學，我覺得山東話如果說得柔和淸晰，倒也非常悅耳的。他們的語音之所以與國語不同者，彷彿是平聲的字兒較多的緣故，譬如「昆明是方先生的家鄉，」這九個字，除了「是」和「的」兩字外，都讀成平聲，那麼，雖然不正確，而大概離山東話不遠了，我想</p>
<p>女工房裹，雖然沒有混亂和煩囂的氣氛，然而也並不絕對的嚴肅，我總覺得偶爾發笑，或者稍稍的談話會减去些工作的勞頓。有一天早晨，剛打了鐘，大家正在開始工作的時候，阿玉奔進工房裏來，氣噓噓的說：「×先生，我因爲等倒馬桶的，我不知道他今天來得道麼遲，我倒好了兩個馬桶，我所以遲到了。」多坦白！多眞誠！這種毫無虛飾的話，祇有從她們的嘴裏可以聽到，不料她的話還沒有完，有一陣老鴉呌似的笑聲突破了靜寂的空間，原來被同伴們稱做傻瓜的阿牛笑倒了，她立刻發見自己不對，連忙帶住。（未完）</p>

<p>天津二十二日電、今日匯市、依然軟弱、行情有行無市、對美鬆二一八七五、爲三辦士二一八七五、對美長三七五、爲六元二五、申匯升六元、爲一百四十元「聯鈔」暗盤不動赤開低至三千元、故亦猛小八十元、計大同行一度改懸二百八十元爲當日低價、逾五分後、因烚赤頓起反動、故亦回上二十元、再逾五分（九時五十分）續回高二十元、十時二十五分又回上三十元、此後未聞變化、結果掛小十元、大同行改懸三百五十元、新同行爲三百四十八元、收進毫無定價、</p>
<h3>處混亂狀態下　金市瞬息萬變　晨開最低行情幾破三千元大關　午後流言又起塲外竟無敢進者</h3>
<p>昨日現金烚赤暗盤市况、上午情勢仍在驚濤駭浪中、蓋上落之大、一刻千變、晨開傾疲、幾破入三千元大關、嗣後猛漲、衝出三千五百元大關、高低差額、竟有五百四十元之巨、實因人心仍帶恍惚、塲內有一買均買、有售靴找進戶所致、人心仍視外匯緊鬆爲轉變、初時因聞匯豐內盤劇鬆、一般浮多頓感不安、加以銀樓帮因隔日門市部大量吸進、更形恐慌、一時爭先恐後、祇聞一片喊賣之聲、抑價猛塞、跌風之大、活像前日橫跳之狀、晨開竟硬撳五百六十五元爲三千元、嗣以跌勢未免過猛、且外匯經日行與西商猛扒後、驟然回緊、引起買風、錢兌業搜羅於前、證券帮及香港帮力進繼後、故市勢頓起激烈反動、一度竟昂達三千五百四十元高峰、午刻因外匯復鬆、且市上有傳聞銀行於下星期一起再行限制提款之說、買風稍戢、市象復疲、回低至三千四百七十元收盤、下午因値外匯週六無市、且同業若在週六午後所做交易、照例須在下週一交割、但邇來金價波浪之大、同業以避免風險起見、决停市半天、致無正式行市、塲外據聞三千四百三十元有賣戶而無進者之說、若照午收三千四百七十元、結果續降九十五元、半天次易仍旺、約一千六七百兩、銀樓飾金亦隨之先猛跌而後步回、終則掛小十元、海關金與中英純金等均無變化、</p>
<p>烚赤跌九十五元</p>
<p>自晨每條（十兩）、初開因聞外匯猛鬆、故一般手中握有實貨者、頓感不安、允以銀樓帮因隔日門市部收進過多、故而恐慌更甚、一時大家爭先恐後、互相抑價猛塞、然買方鑒於此等情形、更不敢接手、市價處於賣風籠罩下、竟猛撳五百六十五</p>
<h3>金融上又生新謠言　經調査確係爲謠諑　應恢復舊有之信心</h3>
<p>自兩次限制提現及兩决外滙暴縮加以投機官商推波助瀾，對於「八一三」以後存現付現之信念，完全打銷，故雖一再宣吿，自此决限制提現後，存入現鈔，仍付現鈔，烏能得到信任，銀行方面，但見鈔票流出，收入者寥寥，續有宣傳有華北鈔票四千萬元運滬套取外滙之說，突將華北鈔票停止使用，而近月來某某銀行趁各方提現之便，儘量將華北鈔票推出，且多紙張新鮮，逈非舊物，狐埋狐猾，徒使忠實之存戶，遭受損失，以致市上謠言更多，人心浮動，且影響波及於商業銀行，邇日提現之盛，豈能以造作宣傳，掩盡天下人耳目，昨日更傳有新辦法將於明日星期一）實行之說，風聲所播，各銀行提現又盛，有謂此係庸人自擾，而不念孰令致之者，昨日市上所傳，大致有下列三點：（一）自明日起三次限制提取現鈔，由每週五百元減少爲一百五十元或二百元，匯劃提款亦同樣限制，每週祗准一千元，（二）銀行或將變更營業時間。（三）亦有謂某銀行將遷徙，此項謠言，在平時絕難得人相信，至今日則以謠言往往成爲事實，不能令人戒懼，但後經調查所得，此三說全無根據，並非事實，蓋某某銀行何必再遷，又如果三次限制提現，或變更營業時間，或其他新辦法，決無使金融界獲益，反有害於金融界，且爲叢毆爵，亦非金融界之福，故今日之急，厥爲恢復大衆對於金融業存放之信心，則謠可不闢而自破矣。元之巨、開市銀樓帮賣予錢兌業五十兩、價三千元、嗣忽聞匯豐掛牌勿動、及匯市內盤轉緊、引起買風、錢兌業等爭先力吸、一霎時竟回上二百元、錢兌業進銀樓帮五十兩、價三千二百元、時證券帮北帮亦來猛進、市勢更堅、不久又狂抬二百元、證券帮進錢兌業五十兩、價三千四百元、後買勢稍弱、一度叉跌至三千三百元、此後某銀樓代港帮突來力購、加以某金號（代投機商）及證券帮亦競相搜羅、雖有銀樓帮傾向套賣、但頭寸仍感求過於供、漲風軍起、打關、一度昂達三千五百四十元高峰、乃證券帮吸進錢兌業五十兩、時錢兌業獲利出籠、一度又撳低至三千四百七十元、此後雖某掮客代業外獲利了結、但某錢兌業及證券帮等進意甚濃、市勢又轉向上、證券帮進某破三千四百元至五百元二重大金號五十兩、價三千五百三十五元、將近午刻、忽聞外匯鬆硬、進者漸少、市勢下疲、復破入三千五百元關內、某金號賣予證券帮五十兩、三千四百七十元爲午收價、聞收後市勢續疲、三千四百五十元有賣戶而無進者之說、午後因値外匯週六無市、且逢空前巨變之際、加以下午同業所做交易、須待下週一午前交割、欲經同業議决以避免意外危險起見、停市半天、結果若照午收之三千四百七十元、較上日則續跌九十五元、查已回跌二天、共計四百八十五元、全天五百四十元上落、現金號之本牌金照烚赤較高十元、現標金照掛牌金低五十元光景、據詢稍有成交、</p>

<h3>外幣續落</h3>
<p>咋英純金跌半辦士，英美匯兌升○六二五、本埠外匯先鬆後緊、外幣英美金鎊、初因烚赤劇跌、零星藏戶多供給、市况甚軟、英美金票需要趨稀、錢兌業供給暢達、市價鬆動、香港票·法郞票·荷蘭票·等、供給俱增、皆趨軟弱、日金票僅曇花一現、復趨下落、晚市爲一元一角、朝鮮票益疲、晚市爲八角七分、公會交易頗盛、惠康出森泰進美金票二百元、振泰出萬康進美金票二百元、寳大出祥康進香港票五百元、森泰出萬康進美金票二百元、永豐出隆昌進香港票五百元、仁泰出同豐進香港票五百兀、做開市價、英金鎊降二元五角、美金鎊降二元、美金票降一角五分、香港票降一角二分五厘、法郎票降二分五厘、新加坡票降二角、荷蘭票降三角、安南票降一角、羅比票義大利票各降八分、澳金票降一元五角、其他各幣未更、</p>
<h3>貼現再升五元</h3>
<p>咋匯劃票據貼現率、跌後復昂、每千元上午一度進至二百元內、但不久現鈔又有需求、午刻回上至二百〇五元、下午有明日銀錢業每週限提存款由五百元减至二百元之謠傳、故叉高起十元、最高二百十五元、比前日再升五元、至錢業公會拆息、早午兩市仍掛一角六分云、</p>
<h3>滙劃籌碼已在緊縮　可抑制無謂之投機</h3>
<p>近日匯劃貼水、日益高漲、爲消滅滙劃貼現之非法交易起見、玉振君會有「消滅滙劃貼現」一文、（詳二十一日本報）、說明主張匯割應由法律規定、不准貼現、至於工商業正當用途應儘量供給法幣、並望銀錢業對於一般存戶無正當用途者、不要一决付給滙劃、免向錢兌店貼現、且主張交換所對於同業領用匯劃、應嚴加限制、實行緊縮等發表後、昨聞交換所亦有通函各同業對於匯劃籌碼不要寬鬆、實行緊縮、大意略云、「本市同業因財部馬電公佈後、會發生提存風潮、銀錢兩業爲安定本市金融起見、晨夕集議、研討辦法、旋商得三行同意、將同業存款二千二百萬元、按九五折成法幣、以備同業支付五百元以下之法幣存款、而另定提供担保領用匯劃辦法、爲調劑同業支付五百元以上匯劃之用、現聞同業有寬鬆匯劃、承做貨物押款、即將貨物作爲領用擔保品、使一般囤積貨物至物價高漲、有助長投機之概、有碍國計民生、希望各行莊以後對於匯劃籌碼、應加緊縮、」</p>
<h3>證劵　內債雖漲　氣勢不甚堅持　外債漲跌互見</h3>
<p>證券暗盤、昨日市况因前日收市後市價已經劇漲、故市價仍極堅定、惟中途因多方出籠、稍稍回鬆、收市後亦未能立定、此種倏忽不定之漲跌、即人心忐忑不寗之現象、前日因有宋部長復長財政之說、人心因財政當有希望、叉復興奮、昨因漲勢過高、故叉引起多頭出籠、未能維持暗中之高價、但比正式行市已高翔不少、蓋以滙劃票據用途窄狹、而公債實爲滙劃之尾閭、故雖謠言不斷、猶不因停付本息而劇變、貼息實現之後、當尙有好面也、昨日僅甲丙兩種變動較多、餘則極爲平穩、賣戶雖多、散而不聚、大戶已未見大數出籠、買戶雖少、胃量則較鉅、故結果仍比隔日漲起二元一角至三元零五分、獨丁種則始終未有做開、收市後暗中交易甚稀、市價稍軟三五角、成交總數的計六七十萬元、茲列簡明表於後、</p>

<h3>紗花　怪風已過　紗市塲一片叫賣聲　熱門貨慘跌四十元</h3>
<p>紗市猛進疾退、上日之漲、昨日之跌、使人心驚膽寒、一升一降之高低、差度已達百元之巨、此種景狀、全係一般投機商造成之恐怖局面、然實際交易、大爲减縮、但觀市上籌碼以測前途、仍在幻變不定中、</p>
<p>現紗晨初開盤、市況平庸、且相延至九時半尚未做開市盤以上日怪風已過、大家觀瞻不動、一般流動掮客均喊雙馬賣出、買者見風畏縮、開價即跌二十元之譜、二十支雙馬外棧價爲五百五十四元、棧單價爲五百四十元、然接受者亦不若瘋狂、成交不旺、少頃多說外櫃放長、謠諑紛繁、謂黃金慘落、進三千元關內、一時賣氣瀰漫、喊聲震天、再跌二十元、外棧雙馬做到五百三十四五元、棧單亦做小至五百二十三四元、就此狀態而論、其中掀風作浪、大有人在也、未幾某紗號忽來進棧單紗幾十包至百包、一時復叉互相呌喊、一度市價徐徐上升十元、棧單高價復達五百四十元、外棧貨又做到五百五十元、迨至收盤時、聞外滙安靜、人氣渙散、叉復回挫、雙馬外棧價爲五百四十一元、棧單價爲五百三十二元、就市塲人心熱烈測之固漲、然亦不必如斯高抬濫撳也、結果半日成交統計一千四百六十五包、行情二十支雙馬慘落三十七元半、牧羊跌十八元、二十支特金城在跌四十元、今日出口棉紗有七百七十件運香港、二百四十五件運海防、茲將各帮口買去之額量分列如下、香港　二九五　雲南　八〇內地　二〇　同行　一、〇八○上日成交　四二五</p>
<p>日紗市面回跌亦迅速、實則人心固多看好面、無奈金融愈緊、現款匱乏、加之小模型布廠紛粉停閉、需要允减、二十支月琴現出價始跌十四元、後稍回四元、爲四百十六元、</p>
<h3>美棉出口津貼　將於下月一日開始　印棉結價日有數起</h3>
<p>外棉市價、紐的棉市、開盤較之隔日即漲三四磅音、利物浦及孟買雖來電吿跌、但因現貨交易進步、布疋銷數轉暢、棉價未見降落、續後因紐的股票漲價、及同業購買、市面堅挺、結果紐的漲十三四磅音、聞美政府討論頗久之美棉出口津一貼問題、於日內即可公佈、並將於八月一日開始執行云、昨日印度趺二羅比、埃及跌十餘磅音、</p>
<p>滬埠外棉交易、咋日平果兒略有成交、現貨價爲通州花　一〇七·〇〇　同業中進　五〇〇包　匯劃棧交　一一〇·〇〇白洛云　一〇〇·〇〇　仁茂號進　二〇〇件　鈔票又又　一〇二·〇〇　源興德進　四〇〇件　又　又</p>
<p>大批印棉明日可到、保和洋行之Lelernbank號、自喀爾喀搭、裝來棉花五千餘噸、該輪明日可到埠、停靠浦投機步伐不齊</p>
<h3>投機步伐不齊　紗價紊亂不可名狀　同一紗廠之貨相差六七十元</h3>
<p>本埠棉紗棉布市塲、在實施限制提款、頗有搖搖欲墮之勢、詎料自日前外匯極度暴縮、使垂斃之市况、突然轉機、禍中得福矣、且漲風劇烈、然市塲情况異常混亂、同一棉紗、同一紗廠之出品、售價竟相差二三十元、至六七十元外、至於新廠之冷門貨與老廠之熱門紗價、距離愈拔愈遠、此種現狀、爲紗業有史以來所罕見、可想一般投機心神恍惚不定也、査二十支雙馬最高峯價曾達五百四十二元、然二十支天女僅售五百十元、要低落三十二元之巨、（均係申新廠之出品）、二十支牧羊價爲四百十六元、二十支金鷄價爲四百六十元、（均係英商都售現鈔）、要相差四十四元、至於新廠出品之二十支紗、旣乏人問津售價與二十支雙馬要差六七十元之夥、十支粗紗亦有同樣的病態、十支醒獅價僅售三百八十五元、十支特金城價四百八十元、兩相比較、幾差一百元左右、此種紊亂如蔴之景象、足見投機者之步伐不齊、究竟棉紗係貨物、深恐與黃金及匯票外、一旦反動、勢難抑止也、回溯民國二十一年亦隨金潮在流前進、繼以價格抬高、消費减弱、一度乃一瀉千里、實則物極必返、爲天之循理、目前處境、當然不同、但價格亦入高境矣、</p>
<h3>糧食米限價　實際已打破</h3>
<p>杜尖　自連朝暴漲後、其勢直上、似有難遏之概、所幸經租界當局一再申令嚴厲限價、八十七八元、係同業中售出、此類印棉如向洋行方面結價、按照昨臼匯兌、可結九十六元、故日來印棉結價者、日有數起、依照此種環境、日後外棉交易將絕、廠方亦祗能减工之一途、等將來日之轉機矣、</p>
<p>中外棉花交易、稍有成交、但廠冒平庸、因法幣難求、且貼率奇昂、蘇北來源因天氣放晴、颶風消散、航運恢復、到通州花一百五十六包茲將現棉情形列左、</p>
<p>東鴻興碼頭起卸、聞該輪係日商山下公司經理、該項棉花、均爲日商所採運、故實在之數目不詳、</p>
<p>各米業名雖遵守、實際上將中决米售限價、已實行打破矣、昨市復續活躍、外行客販續有拉進、更有一般業外心思家、推波助瀾、致市况依然沌混、高貨悉無出樣、但若厚薄粳中决宿熱之貨、再見暗升、悉到限錢、開出二十元、黃雜者亦開十九元七八角、表面雖似定局、若以米質論、計較隔昨又好二三角、所以此種市面、已失標準第存限價之模形已干、杜洋尖埠尖亦相互並提二三角、</p>
<p>變元　去路雖仍平常、然以香港糯照日前外匯結算、須售二十七八元、實開二十元零二角、遂亦提三角有奇總之無論粳尖糯米、一律暴升、照前最低價相核、巳漲高二元半云三元有奇、若無限價、漲風恐不知如何矣、統計全市來貨、河下無到、車輪包子，僅抵常州及南帮貨九車、計一千一百餘包、成交一萬五千七百餘包、今日星期、市塲休業無市、</p>
<p>客秞　中决機米與砶糙米續加二三角、因來源逐决减少、且有一批途失、而消化除本街外、內地鄕莊叉起辦裝、昨店客兩貪、統市開出四千七八百包之多、惟特別高貨已核划在十六元限盤之上、市上仍無正式交易云、</p>
<p>洋米　最近新到之西貢米、因貨方堅守、迄未正式出樣、昨因本客秈再度上漲、且乏高秈出樣、而新西貢呂質兩佳、頗爲進戶歡迎、、因此昨日乃有二十四元之高價售開、成交三百包仍係一百九十八斤原包云、</p>
<h3>現粉驟漲一角</h3>
<p>小麥突有南帮問津</p>
<p>麵粉　昨現粉市已轉漲、自外匯金市劇變以來、滬市物價莫不狂騰、而粉市亦早已暗堅、實受市上回籠貨之傾軋、故廠盤遲遲未加、連日回籠漸少、本客需要頗貪、故昨日起二號粉廠盤即由四元六角半增至四元七角半、比前日驟漲一角、聞回籠貨價亦已漲至五元四五角匯劃、叉傳客帮要求匯劃付款、廠方亦有通融開售五元六角匯劃之說者、統市成交的有三萬包、除本街及內地零批一萬餘包外、餘均南北客帮零星辦去、</p>
<p>小麥　昨麥市亦挺、近以物價高漲聲中、囤戶迭有吸收、實銷除少數直接送廠外、而南洋港帮鑒於麥價、尙屬廉宜、亦在此時略有吸收、統市售開蘇州·崑山·常州·明光·等麥共一千六百八十包、價爲六元八角五分至七角三分、市面又緊數分、</p>
<h3>糖市　糖價一致回跌</h3>
<p>昨糖市以外匯稍見回鬆、而倫敦電訊亦有轉降、八月份七先令、十二月份六先令二辦士二五、明年三月份六先令二辦士七五、荷蘭電、收回價續有微鬆、九月份爲七·二〇荷盾、本市以連日猛漲、至是遂亦回降元許、公會划盤、二四粗白本棧現貨三十四元、外棧三十三元八角、轉口貨初降至二十六元、二百包、繼又降半元、爲二十五元半、五百包、太古車白B嘜西棧三十六元、東棧五元半、西棧CW嘜三十五元半、CX嘜三十五元三角、DY嘜三十五元、HX嘜三十四元七角、H嘜車赤二十二元、荷赤現貨二十六元半、轉口二十元、本一號白三十三元、一號冰三十九元、晶明冰四十元半、國糖亦呈懈勢、以行方納胃不濃、致乏成交、據鼓嶼電訊、刁靑划申市價須現鈔十七元外云、</p>
<h3>海味　國產尾去路活躍　金山尾成本奇昂</h3>
<p>國產蝦尾、因洋貨成本異常昂貴、故銷路頗活躍、近開龍鬚尾爲一百四十元、羊角溝尾一百三十元、溫州開洋八十元、一律現鈔成交、査金山尾用目前滙水劃之成本須四百元有奇、邇來雖無到貨、然本市尙有存積僅呌二百元（現鈔）、蓋國貨可以替代、受手寥寥、</p>

<p>蘇垣臨街有一教堂，其後又一小敎堂，最後則爲西婦住宅。前禮拜日適有中國敎友自杭州來，與該二敎堂敎友講論敎義，時有蘇婦多人掣携子女，咸來聽講，其中有在敎堂者，有初來者，婦女計不下三五十人。街上之人望見門內婦女過多，遂哄傳謂西人將挖小兒眼睛矣。因此日適有大紳家迎娶，出看百花輿者甚衆，故向敎堂前來叩門者，愈積愈多，蓋欲哄鬧敎堂以作消造，以湊熱鬧也。門內敎士屢勸莫哄，均置若罔聞，叩門愈急，勢將打坍，於是敎士祇得拔關啟門，任其入看。然人衆嘈雜，有礙講書，故不久欲請彼等退去，其時去者半留者半，門終不得闔，而看者見無甚奇異，亦均欲退去。忽來一人喊稱：「爾所欲殺之幼孩，藏匿何處，聲勢俱厲！有西敎友之能華語者婉言勸解，致被或推或擠，然揆其心，則並無惡意。四五百人中不過一二十人思啟釁隙而已，餘者殆乘機欲看洋房內景，以新眼界耳。當時有一西人出投縣署，設令君公出未回，經管事者派役五名前往，則里甲亦已到矣。大衆見差役到塲，均一哄而散云。</p>
<h3>孔廟求孕</h3>
<p>潤州有孔子廟，其門前兩石獅，前排列燭橋，香烟鼎盛！予奇而問之，閣者吿予曰：「婦人不孕，但燒蠟炬爇旃檀於石獅前，便得男，此潤州風俗也。」噫！山東人求孕於狐，湖南人求孕於猿，此則求孕於石獅也。</p>

<h3>苦幹</h3>
<p>— 潑林山司</p>
<p>——成功的不二法門</p>
<p>咖啡在西洋各國，和我國的茶一樣，本來都是一種極普通的飲料，可是說出來眞使人不相信：意大利的首相墨索里尼，說他自己在二十歲以前，簡直連做夢也未曾嘗過咖啡的滋味，照這樣看來，那麽那位意大利的「並肩王」在童年時代的境遇大槪總不會比你們更好的了。據多方而的證明，在公園中，他曾經搶奪過兩個英國女子用作野宴的食物，在瑞士日內瓦警察局，也曾打過指印，在意大利，他曾被警察逮捕竟達十一决之多，當時的行爲，簡直被人目爲下流。不過因爲他能苦幹，換言之就是能忍受一切別人所不能忍受的艱苦；不論泥水匠，裁縫，巧克力廠工人，新聞記者，他都曾嘗試過，因此結果終於成功了，大大的成功了。他的行徑我們雖然不敢贊同，但是以一個鐵匠的兒子，居然能做到舉世聞名的偉人，實在不得不令人欽佩，而足爲我們取法的，他的毅力的確太感動人了。此外如煤油大王洛基斐勒，非戰公的的發起人凱洛格，英國第一任工黨首相麥唐納等，莫不是出身低微，因苦幹而獲得成功的。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友，允其是環境惡劣的小朋友：（我以爲能看本刋的大槪都有高小的程度了）你們現在需要負担你們家中的生活費嗎？大淸早你們要替報館送報嗎？晚上你們要替別人做一些零碎工作嗎？雖然爲了要减輕你們父親的負担，自然不得不工作，但是也許要感到苦痛或灰心，不過當你們知道了不可一世的墨索里尼在未成功之前的一切，那麽實在不應輕視你們自己。不論是在求學的，半工半讀的，或是工作的小朋友們，都應該在你們的本位上努力！苦幹！忍受一切別人所不能忍受的艱苦；那麼結果一定會得到你們費去了勞力所換來的酬報，決不致於落空的。諸位小朋友牢記着黑奴成功者自傳作者所說過的兩句話：一個人所遭受到的挫折困難愈多，他的成功做就也愈大」。</p>
<h3>模範的暑期生活</h3>
<p>— 女宛</p>
<p>覺敏在假期初的第一星期，也像其餘的小朋友一般的愛玩，而要玩過暢快才罷，把幾天來大考的緊張情緒完全鬆弛了。可是一星期後的他　，感到疲乏而無聊，有時空閒得可怕，畢竟他是一個好學而努力的兒童，所以自動的立了有收縮性的課程表，每天按步就班的做去，覺得很是滿意。</p>
<p>不過在他發見他家周圍，有許多目不識丁和整天游蕩的孩子們，忽然起了同情心，覺得他們把寳貴的兒童時代荒廢了，豈不可惜，况且敎師和父母所敎訓的要服務要助人，深印在他腦中，他想這長長的暑假不是實行的最好機會嗎，於是他把自己的意思講給父母聽，他的雙親是多麼快活啊，特地出空了一間小室，專作他們讀書的地方，覺敏是格外忙碌了，佈置課室啊，選擇材料啊！而不再覺得空閒與無聊了</p>
<p>覺敏的學校，在雙親的贊助下，家長們的感激下，孩子們的好奇下，於上星期一開學了，一間小窒中，擠滿着許多開始要受敎育的孩子們，好似私塾似的，不過敎師是一位精神飽滿的小先生，他起初敎他們簡單方塊字，是那麼忍耐和誠懇，一遍又是一遍，這些孩子們也覺得相當有趣，非常用功的學習，幾天以後，覺敏的美滿果實結成了，孩子們不再是一字不識的亮眼瞎子，漸漸地，他們的知識慾一天天大起來，覺敏有時要覺得自己學識的缺乏，於是遇到困難問題，便要去問父親或姐姐，由此他也增進了不少知識，這時他才領悟到敎師說的一句話：「助人即是助己」。可不是嗎？覺敏不但在學識方面增加了，他的辦事能力也老練得多。所以自此後他更努力敎這班小朋友們，因爲他們的進步！就是自已的進步啊！</p>

<p>—明兒避難記之二十六—</p>
<p>明兒等一夥兒的運氣還不算十分壊，江山船雖闊別了杭州差不多有一個星期多了，總算下雨的日子從沒有遇到過。</p>
<p>那知這天淸晨，江山船一起了程，天空中片片的烏雲，似乎受到了集合的號令，聚集在一起，密密的佈了陣，陰沉沉地等待那總攻的命令。太陽也嚇得不敢伸出頭來。明兒當船開行了不久，便被迫着起身，睡眼惺忪地，覺得混身的沉重，不像晴天時的暢快。他眼見得天是這樣的可怕，今天一定有下雨的可能了。老天也毫無憐惜的使這羣苦命的逃難人嘗嘗雨天的風味。</p>
<p>果然不出他的意外，老天待他們吃過了早飯，便下了總攻的命令，雨滴一陣子向地面上殺來了。殺殺的雨聲夾着怒風鼓勵的吼聲，一刻不停的衝下來，船老大愁眉不展的打發他的伙伴們上船（因爲他們在岸上背縴）來穿防雨的工具—簑衣和箬帽。</p>
<p>「又下雨了！挺討厭的。」船老大帶着怨恨的口吻，自言自語的咕噥着，一面把他的箬帽向頭上一套，更把一根帶在頭後一扣，明兒深深地替他担心，道也難怪他，他眼見得那著帽似乎頂在船老大的頭上，沒有一些連帶的關係，萬一來一陣大風，便耍飛掉了。其實明兒太蠢，難道那船老大還不知道嗎？他仲直了頭頸，呆瞧着船老大穿簑衣，因爲他從沒有見過這一回事，不知不覺的把自己的嘴也張得大大的，而心中很想穿一穿簑衣，這玩意兒眞有趣。</p>
<p>下了一連半天的雨，打着一個上午的逆風。艙前的船板早常的打開着，因此風夾雨拼命的向艙裏吹打進來，船板上的鋪蓋都灑滿了雨滴，濕潮潮的，晚上怎麼睡呢？明兒眞有些着急，可是着急有什麼用呢？它們老實不客氣的依舊幹着，因此只好消極的把舖蓋拖進了一些。但它還是不肯放鬆，雨滴更俏皮的從船篷的罅兒間鑽進來，一滴一滴的滴下來，陣陣的風却在旁邊在笑着，贊美它聰明的本領。</p>
<p>在雨色濛濛的中午過了浙江省最後的一個小鎭——威坪。</p>
<p>雨繼續的打着，風倒比較小了一些。明兒呆坐在艙裏，眞是悶煩極了。看書也不高與，睡覺也睡不熟，望望野景，外面在下雨，不給他去望。呆坐着，呆坐着……時光却在一刻一刻的過去了。</p>
<p>「先生，我到岸上去呌他們來檢査。」船老大探頭進來　，繼續地說着：「這裏是安徽和浙江的界口，必須要檢査過後，才可以開船。」他說了道話便上岸去了。明兒一聽了這幾句話，便站起身來，把頭伸出去望了一下，只見一條長長的跳板，在遠處矮矮的房屋。他便不敢再看，委實這雨怪可惡的，滴在他的頸裏。後來跑上來三個人，在艙板底下瞧了一下，便走出去了。明兒後來才知道，原來船裏如果裝了什麽酒和鹽，到安徽省去便要納稅的，怪不得東西的價錢要責了。</p>
<h3>賣冰的孩子</h3>
<p>— 陳念雲</p>
<p>沒有一絲風，大地間好像停止了呼吸，一團炎炎的赤日，高高地坐在天空中，沒遮攔地把熱氣吐到宇宙間來，天氣是熱得人快要透不過氣來了。</p>
<p>「冰喲！……冰喲！……賣冰喲，！」</p>
<p>這是一個只有八歲的孩子的呼聲，這聲音是喊得怪響的</p>
<p>這孩子姓蘇，名呌敬平，他是一個怪活潑的孩子，他的父親，是拉黃包車的，他的母親，在一個紗廠裏做工，他自己因爲也耍吃飯，所以在這酷熱的夏天，來幹這一項賣冰的生意。</p>
<p>他每天在火焰般的陽光下奔跑！呌喊！汗珠一點一滴地自額上掛下來，馬路上的柏油，被炎陽曬得溶化，地面上是熱得盪脚；但是，他並不怕熱，他不敢站住了休息一會，他更不敢從自己的籃子裹拿出一塊小冰來含上一口，因爲他怕愧，道麼大了還做這小孩子的玩意兒，眞可羞呀！不好了，少賣了一個銅子，就要餓肚皮</p>
<p>他走過一所學校的門口，看見裏面有許多小學生，正坐在椅子上讀着書，敎室中是多麽的淸潔！他又走過一所公園，看見有許多小朋友，在草地上拍着皮球，在樹蔭下講着笑話，在池塘邊看着金魚，他是多麽的義慕啊！但，他是一個中貧苦的孩子，對於這一種快樂的情形，只能在睡夢中去領略</p>
<p>天氣儘是熱得使人發昏，太陽儘是薰蒸得地面上盪脚，但是，這一個賣冰的孩子，依舊在馬路上奔跑着！呌喊着！</p>
<p>「冰喲！……冰喲！……賣冰喲！」</p>
<p>這是一個只有八歲的孩子的呼聲，這聲音是喊得怪響的</p>
<h3>咬指甲就是吃微生物</h3>
<p>— 鄭國器</p>
<p>上課了，先生走進敎室，我向先生望了一望，就低下頭去，做什麼？咬指甲的老脾氣發作了！自己想想也慚給先生看見了，先生就說：「指甲裏有微生物，你耍咬指甲和吃微生物沒有兩樣。」對啊！微生物是不好吃的呀！吃了要害病的，我相着想着，鐘聲噹噹噹的響了，下課了，先生走出去了。我把手舉了起來，仔細一看，指甲前面有一條又黑又髒的東西，這裏面一定有微生物，微生物是不能吃的呀！啊我覺悟了，以後決不咬指甲了；並且趕快的用剪刀剪去了長的半分的指甲，用肥皂洗去了指甲內的汚垢，啊我覺悟了！我從今天起決不再有這咬指甲的壊習慣了！</p>
<h3>畜生道中（十）</h3>
<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>彭其急道：「不不，我的身體裏是不會有什麽絲的；不過我的衣袋中倒也有好些銅綫鉛綫在着。」蜘蛛道：「別管它，你呌它綫，我呌它絲，綫啊絲啊，好在是一樣的東西。就是胃和衣袋，我以爲也差不了多少。好——」</p>
<p>那蜘蛛正在舉備地把它的結綱課程傳授給彭其的時候，猛聽得陣拍拍之聲，却見那頭喜講故事的山雀突然的飛來了，向着那些鳥啊，獸啊小動物啊切切低語，又一傳二二傳三的傳了開去，査問彭其到底是誰，到底是怎樣一個人？</p>
<p>這查問的結果，立刻使它們譁噪起來，只聽得那些飛的走的一齊提高了聲音，向着彭其怒呼道，「該死的！惡魔！」「該死的！惡魔！」一頭老雄猫挺起了尾巴跑到一棵樹上去，放出非常厭惡的聲音來道：「僕歐！」這「僕歐」兩字，是畜生道中駡人的名詞，等於人類中駡「畜生」一樣。</p>
<p>在這一霎時間，眞的騷動到了極點，那頭喜歡多說多話的山雀，更非常的興奮，不住的在樹枝上跳來跳去，東也說一句，西也說一句，加重了緊張的空氣。</p>
<p>有一頭母獅，在它自己的一族中是一位曾祖母了；身子特別的胖，簡直臃腫得動也不能動，這時它也興奮得很，向着大衆說道：「請大家想一想，要是我們也到了下邊去，不知他要怎樣的對付我們哩！」山雀連忙接口道：「但是他在這裏，可就在你們手掌之中啊！」</p>
<p>別的畜類一聽了這話，就同聲喊道：「是啊是啊！他在我們的手掌之中，可不要放過了他！責罰他！責罰他！帶他到獅子那裏去！」於是許多畜類，簇擁着彭其到了獅子跟前，一面仍在喊道：「責罰他！責罰他！」</p>
<p>一頭驢子走上來，說道：讓我來責罰他！讓我來先把一塊冰冷的鐵嵌在他的牙齒裏，在他的兩個嘴角之間擊來擊去。讓我來拉着他跑，一面用鞭子來向他身上抽打。讓我來打他的頭，踢他的筋，鞭他的背，刺他的腰；當下我更逼着他飛快的跑，沒命的跑，把他的壊脾氣改變過來，然後再把重重的東西壓在他背上，敎他怎樣的駃着走，而一面就將全副的鞍轡都給他受用了。」</p>
<p>那獅子忙逍：「且慢，且慢，我的朋友，你因爲一時在氣頭上，所以說出這些話來；但你們要是呌我裁判的話，我們對於道個罪人，還得用公道來處置他。」</p>
<h3>喜樂（四）</h3>
<p>要得眞而大的喜樂，必須照着上帝的話，（聖經）一字一句，完全服從。有人說，這樣可就太難了，聖經中的話，離世俗太遠，我們是世俗中人，如何能照聖經的話句句服從呢？我說；請你不用躭心，我所說的信服上帝，服從上帝是說甘心情願。問題是在肯不肯，不是在能不能。　肯不肯與能不能，是兩個問題，上帝對人要求，只有一個肯字，至於力所不能，上帝忍耐，寬容，等候，決不因此斷絕神人的交通。譬如一位父親，命令他的兒子說；「到葡萄園中去作工」。兒子遵命就去，這就是肯。至於去的時候，走得快，慢，路上跌倒幾次，到園中作工多，少，好，壞，那都是能不能的問題　，慈愛的父親，並不計較。上帝是慈愛的父親，也是如此。若有人說；走路太慢，路上跌跤，到園中作工太少，太壞，上帝都要懲罰，把上帝說成最嚴厲的父親，那是魔鬼的道理，不要聽他。聖經就是上帝對人發的命令，你讀聖經的時候，只要逐字逐句，從良心的最深處，答應一個肯字，（不要自欺）這就是信。上帝必稱許你，說好，此之爲因信稱義。有上帝稱你爲義，有上帝稱爲義，你的喜樂必定立刻滿足，世界任何困苦患難，都不能奪人的喜樂。　上海基督敎文字佈道會郵箱一二二七號</p>
<h3>當心凉飮</h3>
<p>— 子系</p>
<p>現今已到了盛夏季節，一般馬路小販又在競賣各種凉飲物品。像刨冰啦；冰棒啦；凉粉啦；酸梅湯啦，綠荳湯啦；以及其他瓜菓一類的東西，沿路呌賣，營業也相當地發達。不過這類凉飲物品，大都不很合於衛生的，因爲刨冰，冰棒，凉粉，酸梅湯，綠荳湯等，大都用生水所製，自然生水中是免不了混雜着不潔的雜物及病源菌；此外如西瓜，以及其他瓜菓一類的東西，大都不加遮蓋，任飛揚的塵埃不斷地沾點，讓蒼蠅一類的昆蟲，任意散佈菌。自然塵埃中攪雜着更多的微生物。加之瓜菓最易腐爛，食物一爛，無疑細菌必多。總而言之：不論那種沿路呌賣的各種凉飲物品，十九是不淸潔的，不衛生的，不愼誤吃了，體弱的馬上要發生病症；就是强壯的，那末日久後也必生病。固然在這種火傘高張，汗流浹背的時候，要減除渴熱的心願，確是人人一樣的，人人需要的。不過在飲用的時候，更須注意淸潔，當心衛生。須知减除渴熱問題果然重耍，而注意衛生的問題更爲重要。現今時常有不少小朋友！爭先恐後的沿路購買凉飲物品，殊不知這裏有着很大的危險。希望小朋友們特別留意，格外當心，諸如此類的東西還是一律拒絕勿買爲是。</p>

<h3>看護小姐的生活</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>她們必須有和愛溫柔的天性　戰後有許多為傷兵難民服務</p>
<p>頭上戴的是白色的帽子，身上穿的是白色的制服，白襪子，白鞋子……的「看護小姐」，給你的印象，恐怕是太够深刻的了。的確的，她們的舉動是靜穆的；　她們的態度是誠摯的；好們的言語是溫和的，她們簡直就沒有一樣東西給人們以惡劣的印象。在今日這個偉大的時代里，「看護小姐」的使命與工作，就更赤得重要與少不得了，在這里，且讓筆者來報道一些有關於她們的日常的生活。</p>
<p>「在整個的婦女職業界中，我想這一種當看護的，的確是可以算得最高尚，最神聖的了。在歐美各國，看護的地位眞的被社會上的一般人們看得很高，無論男女老幼，差不多每一個人都尊重她們，都敬仰她們，這原不是什麼謊話，也就是她們的誠墾，勤勞的服務所使然的呵。」</p>
<p>我的一個朋友，最近生過一場大病，醫生呌他進醫院去診治與療養。在醫院里，我因為曾經去探訪他多次的緣故，我曾遇見了好幾位看護小姐，并且，還與她們談過好幾次，其中有一位李小姐，更是給我以上好的印象，所以，我與她的談話的時光也比較的多些。每當我問她「你對你的職業有什麼感想？」的時候，她就會告訴我上面這一段說話。說話時的那種和愛，溫柔的神情，眞是會令人熱戀起來。</p>
<p>「你每天的生活狀況，可否約略地說一說嗎?」我問她。</p>
<p>「說起我們看護的生活狀況嗎？一般人都看見我們身上穿着挺整潔的制服，脚上穿着潔白的皮鞋，大家就都以為我們的生活是很舒服，是很寫意的，但是在事實上呢，我們的生活一聲「清潔整齊」倒是很實在的，舒服與寫意，卻是根本就說不上。」</p>
<p>「我們的工作時間，」她又繼續着對我說：「是沒有一定的。通常我們總有好幾個看護輪流着值班，吃飯的時候是如此，在晚上也是如此。工作完畢後。大部份都回家里去居住，但也有不少就常川住宿在醫院里的。」</p>
<p>「當看護的，最主要的要具備些什條件質呢？」我又向她出了一個問題。</p>
<p>「當看護的，第一張須要具有一種非常的忍耐力。有時候，工作的疲勞，病人的火氣，以及其他一切不如意的地方，的確會使你發起脾氣來，要是你沒有極大的耐性的話，那末，人家給於你的與論，恐怕眞的會十分惡劣的。第二，當看護的都必須有一種和愛，溫柔的天性。病人在病牀上，尤其是那些生重病的，與在院已經住得久的病人，他們的心中，大部份都是很煩躁，并且火冒得利害，要是我們又都是不和氣而硬繃繃的，那病人所得的結果與影響，簡直就會糟糕到極頂了。第三，看護又都需要一種嗜愛整齊，清潔的習慣，因為在醫院里的任何東西，我們都不允許有一些汚漬看見，所以，當看護的都不應該將病牀，桌椅，以及一切的醫藥器械弄得骯髒的。」李小姐對我像是很爽快，她一股腦兒地全將她心中所要說的話都說了出來啦。</p>
<p>最後，又承她告訴了我許多關於她們空暇時的動態，我也一併把它寫錄在後面吧。</p>
<p>「我們在看護的工作之外，又特地約集了幾個志同道合的朋友組織了一個讀書會，我們的目的，就是想利用作工餘下來的空暇，來讀書，來求得一些知識上，技術上的增進。每到星期六或者星期日的時候偶或也跑到影戲館里消磨個半天。在實際上，每當工作完畢了之後，即刻趕至家里去整理家務，抱小孩的「看護小姐」爲數也正不少；有些則更情願拋棄了家庭，獨個兒跑到前綫去為傷兵難民們服務的，她們的精神與志氣，就更值得我們的欽佩了。」</p>

<h3>巫山夢回</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“The　Shining　Hour”</p>
<p>米高美公司出品　南京戲院映</p>
<p>佛萊克鮑才琪是以清麗，沖淡的手法見長的，但是清麗，沖淡的背面，正透露着濃馥的，不可遏止的情感。在「生死同心」中，瑪格蘭莎麗文的病倒在石階上；　洛勃脫楊被擊後從馬車上運回來；　佛蘭支通的爲友復仇，……都是生動而感人。「巫山夢回」他依舊保持着過去的作風，但和「生死同心」比較起來，是不免顯得鬆散。原因是在他分別地去描寫各個人物的關係，和他們的衝突，更在最後火燒新屋的那場戲中，他把瑪格蘭莎麗文的跳到火里去的高潮，草率地放過了。可是在這個錯綜複雜的故事中，他把兄弟，妯娌，目光叔嫂，姑嬸的情感分歧，都能細膩的，週到的，分析着，使人深深地感到這個和平的家庭，爲了那個紐約夜總會的名舞娘的加入，而破壞無餘。舉例來說：洛勃脫楊出場的時候，是裝足着一付不愉快的面孔去規勸他的哥哥，但在回家後的一次，再次，三次的琴聲中，他的移愛瓊克勞馥的情緒，是一步步跟着急進，——在郊外放馬，和水榭擁抱的兩場戲中，那種由淺入深的寫法，很動人的。又如費本德的長姊，她的固執成性，一種女性傳統的觀念深深的執住着她，從她第一次會見瓊克勞馥起（他不願到飛機場去迎接），她就歧視這位和整個家庭不調和的女人，但是她還能忍耐，這忍耐正是她的「長姊如母」的樣子，愛護弟弟茂文陶格拉斯的緣故。這樣一直等到發現瓊克勞馥和洛勃脫楊的關係明顯時，她就和茂文陶格拉斯鬧了起來，（這里更有一種哀憐瑪格蘭莎麗文的同情心所激發）甚至放火燒了新屋。所以整個戲的鬆散是他的缺點，可是描寫各個人物的性格，和他們的衝突，却是他的獨到之處。</p>
<p>至終結尾茂文陶格拉斯跟着瓊克勞馥同走，在個人的意思，還是讓瓊克勞馥單獨走的好。因爲洛勃脫楊旣向瑪格蘭莎麗文懺悔，這位爲了一已之咎，因而使整個家庭騷然的名舞孃，她的毅然出走，也正是留着她懺悔的餘地。或且也更戲劇性一點。</p>
<p>演員中，我以爲演得最好的是瑪格蘭莎麗文，在她知道自己的丈夫移愛瓊克勞馥的時候，她忍受着一切苦痛，向丈夫獻殷勤；　及至事實上已不可挽回的時候，去勸說瓊克勞馥和洛勃脫楊離開這家庭，她的隱痛，她的強作歡容，演得動人之至。洛勃脫楊和瓊克勞馥，始而抑壓，繼而熱情奔放，都能適當地把握着過程的進展，不過火，也無不及。茂文陶格拉斯因爲脚色的決定，稱職而已。費本德（「處女的苦悶」里的母親），一種「長姊如母」的性格，非常穩重。</p>

<p>曾有一個時期，中國的歌舞界是挺鬧得利害的；允其是當黎錦暉在創辦明月歌舞團的時候，團中擁有歌舞界的四大金剛－王人美，黎莉莉，薛玲仙，胡茄－當時，全中國的每一個角落里，幾乎沒有一個不知道這個歌舞團的。同時黎錦暉的作品，自可憐的秋香而七姊妹遊花園，而麻雀與小孩，而三蝴蝶，而小小畫家也沒有一本不是受到人家瘋在般地歡迎的。在學校里，體育與音樂課程作業中，大部份也列上了三蝴蝶等等的歌舞與歌劇－這一個時期，我們的確可將它稱作中國歌舞界的『黃金時代』。</p>
<p>後來，明月社是解散了，王人美，黎莉莉等上好的歌舞人材也都轉入了電影的圈內去，…一直到了今日，中國的歌舞界簡直就消沉得可憐。其間，雖也有新月歌劇團，新華歌劇團的出現，歌舞的人材也造就得不少（如白虹，周璇，黎明健等幾個，都是挺有希望的）但是，往日的聲譽與威望，却終於是不可再得了。</p>
<p>由于歌舞在中國沒落的緣故，中國的歌舞影片，當然也就不能够像美國好萊塢所攝製的衆多與偉大了。過去，中國的歌舞影片，如袁美雲，馬陋芬合演的『人間仙子』，周璇主演的『三星伴月』…等等，要是比起歐美的歌舞片來，在無論那一方面，都可以說是及不上的。這，雖然我們可以說是因爲資本及人力都沒有像他們充足的關係，但是大半的原因，恐怕都是由於歌舞給予一般人們的印象太惡劣的緣故。</p>
<p>事實上，除了美國式的肉麻的「裸舞」以外，一切如古典派，形式主義派，新興的體操化的歌舞劇，都是値得我們每一個人的贊美與提倡的。歌舞，說起來還是一切文藝的起始，原始時代當人類在沒有語言，文字之前，就已有了歌舞了。歌舞的目的，就是以『美的聲』與『美的形』來激發情感的</p>
<p>可憐！高尙純潔的歌舞，却在中國的市儈們的手下牲犧了·什麼四脫舞咧，什麽半夜滑搭精光舞咧，什麼揚貴妃出浴舞咧…全將中國的歌舞界，充滿了色情肉慾的氣氛，其給予入們的印象，在這一種情况之下，又那得不惡劣呢？但是，你可看過「罌粟花」嗎？很可喜地，新型的，前進的中國的歌舞劇是在開放着新鮮的萌芽了。在不久的將來，這一種時代化歌舞劇，常可將中國的歌舞界的「黃金時代」重新恢復過來。努力吧！每一位愛護中國的歌舞劇的同志。</p>

<h3>梨園小事記</h3>
<p>— 海生</p>
<p>劉漢臣向天蟾辭班　天蟾舞台文武老生劉漢臣，前日向當局辭班，預備唱到二十三號止就脫離，暫時北返，辭意非常堅决，到了晚上，後台的文武管事劉遐卿，王奎官都向他要求，體念同班小角，請他唱到二十五　號再說，漢臣就一口答應，總算目前可以相安無事，不過以後的大局怎樣解决，還沒有肯定哩。</p>
<p>趙如泉的歸期展延　共舞台的新角文武老生趙如泉，本來預定十七號動身從昆明回上海的，可是趙被當地新生戲院挽留着，不能脫身，大概二十六號左右纔得成行，共舞台當局預備打電報去催他早些動身，不知在歇夏以後開鑼，能不能够趕進，至於更新舞台邀他，現在由某聞人出來調解，董湧已經讓給對方了。</p>
<p>言少朋的一段軼事　言菊朋的長子少朋，藝宗馬連良，昨天本報曾談及，關於他學馬派，有段極有趣的軼事，在前幾年，他跟着菊朋到南京去唱戲，臨別紀念的時候，他也登台客串三天，不用說是完全的馬調，菊朋在台下看戲，氣得他連說「他是馬連良的兒子！」還有一次在北平，言菊朋和馬連良白天同演白蟒台，有幾位去捧言的朋友，却給少朋拉去聽馬連良，並且說：「我父親的戲沒有什麽聽頭」。</p>
<p>張翼鵬歡宴周貽白　大舞台台柱張翼鵬，近來對於文化界的人很接近，這對於他的思想，演技和品格的修養，都有相當帮助，而且他每天下午跟小說家程小靑讀書，能够這樣用功，確楚難能可貴，二十四號下午四時，他假座河南梁園歡宴戲劇家周貽白，聯絡感情，本來，翼鵬預定今天演寗武關，因爲要趕排三十七本西遊記新戲，祇得變更，展延到新戲唱至最後的二星期再行演出，要定座看這部戲的人是很多，外傳他的改戲，是爲了劇木問題，絕對不確。</p>
<p>高百歲咋抱病登台　高百歲自從他的伙計老王捲逃，心裏感到異常的懊喪，前天晚上，不知吃了些什麽東西，肚裏突然奇痛起來，直痾了一宵，沒有停止過，昨天早晨還在便桶上暈了過去，後來他到醫師處診治，注射了一針，吃了一瓶藥水，這纔稍愈，下午卡爾登戲院是有日戲的，他仍舊抱病登台，眞好算盡職的了。</p>
<h3>梨園外紀</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>因言菊朋的紅想起貫大元的潦倒</p>
<p>「大元，字昱明，父名紫林，業武旦，孺名曾兒，梨園行皆以貫曾呼之。大元七八歲時，即從名敎師賈麗川習鬚生，時賈已至暮年，其徒之大名鼎鼎者如許蔭棠·李鑫甫·張榮奎·高慶奎·及其侄洪淋（孺名狗兒）等。麗川歿後，大元復從洪林習劇，時洪林方享盛名，爲學譚之最負時望者。洪林之夫人即大元之姨母，彼此旣屬　誼，故洪林乃盡以所學授之大元，彼聰穎過人，每値老譚出演，叉時往觀摹，因而能戲極多，文·武·唱·作·以及靠把諸戲，草不俱有根柢，學譚諸人中能稱全材者，叔岩外亦祇大元一人而已。他若張毓庭·貴俊卿·王又宸·言菊朋等，皆屬半路出家之下海票友，幼工旣無，武工·靠把·又均非所長，倘以嚴格論之，俱不得謂爲全材也。」</p>
<p>大元旣有這樣的好根柢，際此鬚生人材日益凋零的時候，按理說他很可享大名啦，爲什麽還潦倒舊京，十餘年來上海都沒有人想着把他接到南邊來呢。這個問題說起來，却有幾種複雜的原因，第一，他太守規矩，一點不知趨時變化；第二，身量略嫌矮小，台風·扮相·自顯得不如馬·譚·諸人漂亮美覜；第三，嗓音稍左，倒嗆後始終未曾回復；第四，口齒太笨，不善交際；第五，自與硯秋分裂後，因無本錢組班，許多年來僅爲旦角附庸，不得展其所長，因亦不甚爲外埠劇院當局所注意，其藝名似已漸爲人所遺忘。</p>
<p>除上述數端外，還有一樁事躭誤他前途永不得發展的，就是他這人過於敬重他的那位娘舅陳某了。陳某的那把胡琴，簡直能把人鋸死，手指之不靈活，腦筋之遲鈍，姿勢之不雅相，眞稱得起北京城裏第一把無人領敎的糟琴師。（六五）</p>
<h3>溜冰術（九二）</h3>
<p>— 蓮君琦珍合編</p>
<p>四邊（續）</p>
<p>結論</p>
<p>普通學溜冰者，往往未將四邊學全，即急欲學各種花樣與舞步，此猶如孩童正在學步即欲跳與跑也。按諸實際苟能精諳四邊與其四式，並勤加練習，則事半功倍，即在擁擠塲內行動，不僅可免跌仆，姿勢目極優美，故果欲得個中眞趣，或欲深造，誠不可不練熟四邊，與其每邊之四式身之位置也。</p>
<p>高級花樣之所以難做，由於溜冰者不明轉身前與轉身後身體應有之各種位置，若初學時即練熟之，則臨時必能應付裕如，得心應足。</p>
<p>溜冰爲高尙藝術之一，非經刻苦練習，斷難臻於絕境，故學者欲求精擅斯道，非下決心，耐勞苦，並勤加練習不可也。</p>
<p>凡打彈球者咸知球被擊後，彈捧須隨在球之後行，不可擊球後棒即停止向前，或立即縮後，良以此「隨後行」能使球之方向準確與速力加增也，彈球如此，溜冰亦然，以足推進後，手宜隨後行，身之各部，亦均在足推足後隨後扶助之，則姿態必雅而速力不减，此點實亦溜冰學者所不可不知者也</p>
<p>用四邊溜冰常有以下通病，學者宜時時留意之。</p>
<p>（一）開步不自立定始，即不是一推就勁，而先用主足借力</p>
<p>（二）推動不用鞋之全邊，而用足尖，致客腿在推動之後，姿態不雅。</p>
<p>（三）所做之圈不圓，客易變成圓形，此則一由於開步時未對正軸心，二則主足落地時，不即落在應用之邊上，（即若外進時，主足先落在內邊。內退時，主足先落在外邊等。）</p>
<p>（四）外進外退之行，身不向外傾。</p>
<p>（五）凸臀，即臀不在肩下，反而凸出。</p>
<p>（六）臂與腿動作過度，即臂舉得過高，腿提得太高。</p>
<p>（七）頭之下垂（注意下視祇須眼球向下，切勿低首。）</p>
<p>（八）各種共他動作過度，或身體僵硬，不寫意自然。欲測騐四邊程度之高低，與其基礎是否穩固，祇須視學者對於弧行與身之各種位置成績如何。其試騐法即每足須用四邊連畫圓圈三次，所畫各圈與直軸之位置不可移動，大小不可更改即可。</p>

<h3>Chinese Troops in Hubei Recapture Yangzi Town; Han River and Eastern Jing River Waters Rise Sharply, Flooding Japanese Positions; Stalemate in Northern Guangdong, Chinese Troops Advance Towards Guangzhou; Fierce Fighting Continues in the Chaoshan Area, Japanese Troops in Chao'an Surrounded</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a Chinese source today, Chinese troops have recaptured Yangzi, 15 miles northeast of Zhongxiang, and all strategic points outside the city have also been recovered by Chinese forces. Street fighting is now underway within the city. Japanese troops on the Qianjiang-Tianmen highway are also largely retreating voluntarily. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>
<p>Liuhuang: On the 20th and 21st, Chinese troops launched a surprise attack on Anbu, Caitang, Gezhou, and other places, achieving considerable gains and remaining engaged in mixed fighting. No Japanese troops were found near Chaoyang Da Hao. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Military news: Japanese troops near Qinshui are still in the area of Fudian Town and Mayi Village (both east of Qinshui), attempting to invade Duanzhuang along the Qin-Gao Highway. A Chinese unit is currently blocking the Japanese troops. Another Japanese force of over a thousand men moved south from Yangcheng but was repulsed by Chinese troops.

Chinese troops are making steady advances towards the Duoxiang River north of Qianjiang, forcing Japanese troops to retreat to Pengshi River. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yichang) In central Hubei, continuous rains have caused the Han River and the Eastern Jing River to swell rapidly. On the 22nd, several sections of the dikes along the Han River and the Eastern Jing River suddenly collapsed, causing widespread flooding eastward. Many Japanese troops on the east bank of the Han River were drowned, and a vast area of Japanese positions was submerged. Qianjiang is surrounded by water and has effectively become an isolated city. Chinese forces east of the river are therefore more active. Chinese troops between the Han-Yi Road and Yuekou in Qianjiang are launching a strong offensive. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yichang) Chinese troops in Hubei continue to attack the Japanese, achieving considerable gains. After capturing Changshou Shop on the 16th, a Chinese unit is now fiercely attacking Zhongxiang. Another unit attacked Nanxinji on the 17th, catching the Japanese off guard. Dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed, and Chinese troops immediately occupied Nanxinji, then pursued their advantage, recovering Gaojiaji, Yejiaji, and Fanjiaji. Furthermore, after capturing Sishigang City and Guantoujian on the 17th, a Chinese unit attacked the Japanese troops in Yuxin River, engaging in fierce fighting for several days and killing many Japanese soldiers. The Yuxin River is now under Chinese control, and a fierce offensive is underway. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Fancheng: The Japanese troops in Yangzi continue to receive reinforcements. Chinese and Japanese forces are currently engaged in fierce fighting in the northwestern highlands. On the 20th, over a hundred Japanese soldiers attempted a sneak crossing at Sanchakou, west of Yangzi, but were routed by a fierce Chinese attack. Many Japanese documents were captured. Fighting near Suixian is still intense. Four Japanese artillery pieces are heavily shelling Chinese positions, but there have been no Chinese losses. On the 21st, Chinese troops launched over a hundred "sliding bombs" at Japanese positions, causing heavy casualties. The Japanese soldiers' groans could be heard from far away. At the same time, Chinese forces destroyed three bridges to hinder Japanese movements. (22nd dispatch)</p>
<p>Laohekou: Wangjiatan, near Yangzi (northeast of Zhongxiang), has been recaptured. A Chinese unit stormed into Zhujia Temple, and another stormed into Yangji, engaging in fierce fighting with the Japanese, killing over seventy Japanese soldiers.

(21st dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) According to military news from here today, after the Japanese troops once again occupied Chao'an, the fighting in the Chaoshan area has intensified. Chinese troops are currently defending along the Han River, adopting a policy of blockade against the Japanese troops in Chao'an to cut off their supplies. Today, nine Japanese boats, fully loaded with Japanese soldiers, attempted to reinforce the Japanese troops in Chao'an, but two of them were sunk by Chinese forces along the Han River. Furthermore, Japanese troops in Jinshan and Hulushan (transliteration) south of Chao'an, surrounded by Chinese forces, were unable to escape and released poison gas twice to break out of the encirclement. (Reuter, 22nd)</p>

<p>Pingjiang: Japanese troops trapped in Baini Bridge attacked Huadong Liuqiao from the southwest on the morning of the 19th but were repulsed by Chinese troops. Chinese forces are currently pursuing them across the Dongliu Bridge towards Baini Bridge. In this battle, the Japanese troops suffered over 300 casualties and abandoned countless military supplies along the way. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>Miluo: Chinese troops north of the Xinqiang River launched a surprise attack on Japanese troops in Xiaotaofang, six miles north of Wujiang Bridge, on the 20th. After two hours of fierce fighting, over fifty Japanese soldiers were killed. An examination of the battlefield revealed the body of Matsuoka Takashi, a war correspondent for the Japanese Daily News. (21st dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Military news: The military situation in Guangdong as of the evening of the 21st is as follows: Chinese troops stormed into the east gate of Chao'an and burned down the Japanese troops' temporary arsenal, then withdrew outside the city.

The defense of Fujian Province is currently the responsibility of the Shaoguan Theater Command. Zhang Fakui visited Fujian last month to inspect the situation and has allocated several divisions of troops to deal with a Japanese invasion. (Special dispatch, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Southern Route慰劳团 Offering Flags on the Front Lines in Northern Hunan</h3>

Mr. Ma reported on the significance of the慰劳团 and the general situation at home and abroad, encouraging the soldiers and civilians to inflict a great blow on the Japanese troops in the vast area between Dongting and Poyang Lakes, ensuring that the Japanese troops could not cross the Lei Pond even one step, and to recover lost territory. When Commander-in-Chief 口 replied, he gave a very detailed account of his principles of building up the army and the people. On the morning of the 21st, the团 continued to inspect the civilian teams organized and trained by 口氏 at the same location. Over a thousand men and women of grades A and B participated.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Battle Situation in Southeastern Shanxi</h3>
<p>Recently, the various battlefields in the north and south have been generally quiet. Despite repeated reports that the Japanese army will have some new strategies and adopt some new offensives; but what is manifested in the facts is only the battle in the Chaoshan corner of eastern Guangdong. And the siege of the guerrilla area in the southeast of Shanxi Province. In eastern Guangdong, although Shantou has been lost for a long time, Chao'an Cheng-hai and other places that are dozens of miles away from Shantou have been lost and recovered repeatedly; as for Shanwei, the Japanese army was completely repelled only a few hours after landing, which shows that it is not difficult for the Japanese army to land, but it is not easy to go deep. Even if they land everywhere, what is the meaning? No wonder they want to tout the so-called "coastal guerrilla attacks" in an attempt to cover up their unconscious blind actions. Therefore, in the future, even if the Japanese army continues to take any actions in various places along the southeast coast, the result will probably be nothing more than that. Regarding the battle in the southeast of Shanxi Province. The Japanese army had already begun attacking the Zhongtiao Mountain area several weeks ago, with great momentum, but the result was nothing; later, they changed their target. With a larger offensive, they divided into nine routes and attacked the highlands between the Taihang Mountains and the Qin River. Such a large-scale siege has certainly exhausted the Japanese army. The number of mobilized troops is no less than 100,000, but nearly 10,000 have been annihilated in just a few weeks; at the same time, although the Japanese army has successively occupied several cities, they were soon surrounded or recovered by the Chinese army. Although the situation in Jincheng (Zezhou) is very critical; at the same time, other important military strongholds such as Dongfeng Nie have indeed been captured by the Chinese army. It can be seen that in the future of the battle, the Japanese army may not have any achievements. The so-called coming with great interest and returning disappointed, the result of the Japanese army's attack is probably unnecessary.</p>
<p>The meaning of the Japanese army's use of troops in Shanxi Province lies in the so-called "mopping up". Why have the Japanese army mostly stopped military offensives on the north and south battlefields, and concentrated on "mopping up" this corner of Shanxi? One is that the Japanese army can be seen to be old and exhausted, and it is currently impossible to advance on all routes; and the second is that the Japanese army's use of troops in this corner of Shanxi is considered very urgent, and it is believed that in order to protect North China or attack the Northwest, this corner must first be cleared].</p>
<p>Let's start from the beginning: When Linfen, Shanxi, fell for a long time in March last year, the war in the north seemed to have come to an end on the surface; but in fact, not only did the war not end. On the contrary, it made the Japanese army even more restless. Because the guerrilla warfare in North China had already started in late October of the year before, and had been widely developed in the past few months. When Linfen fell, the military authorities ordered all regular troops to stay in the local area to carry out guerrilla warfare; therefore, the Linfen battle was nothing less than a milestone in the anti-Japanese war in North China. From then on, the Chinese army did not have to defend a certain position to the death, but could instead flexibly dispatch at any time and place. Intercepting the Japanese army, containing the Japanese army, making them unable to advance or defend, consuming their strength day by day, and sinking into the quagmire day by day. The Japanese army was wary of the Chinese army's guerrilla warfare because of the lessons learned from the Northeast Volunteer Army at the beginning, and urgently sought a solution; especially for Shanxi Province, it was considered a serious hidden danger that must be treated first. Because: First, Shanxi's position is in the hub of the north, and its terrain is high and low. If Shanxi Province cannot be effectively controlled, then everything in North China will be out of the question. Second, Shanxi was the most politically successful place among the northern provinces in the past, and it is also the area where guerrilla warfare in the north originated. Not only is it due to the promotion of the people's morale in Shanxi, and the remarkable achievements of guerrilla warfare, which can be used as a model by the northern provinces and even the whole country; and in fact, other guerrilla areas in the north. If the Jinnan, Jizhong, northern Shandong, and eastern Hebei regions, etc., are all expanded and extended from the Shanxi guerrilla area, the Japanese army believes that if the guerrilla troops within Shanxi Province are not resolved first, then it is not fundamentally a problem of Shanxi Province. The entire guerrilla war may still spread and grow. Third, the position of Shanxi Province is also suitable for the winding of the Yellow River, pointing to Guanzhong in the west, and looking at Zheng Luo in the south. If the guerrilla troops in Shanxi Province are not wiped out for a day, the Japanese army's actions will always be contained, that is, it will always be the key to the northeast bank of the Yellow River, and there will be no way to peep into the northwest in the west, and there will be no way to control the Central Plains in the south. With these three reasons, the central issue of the Japanese army in North China is currently not to seek to advance into the Northwest, but to sweep up Shanxi [a step before advancing into the Northwest].</p>
<p>This so-called "nine-way" advance is not actually the first major move by the Japanese army to "mop up" the west. When the North China guerrilla area was still in its initial stage in late November of the year before, the Japanese army used 20,000 troops, along with aircraft, artillery, and tanks, to divide into eight routes to encircle and suppress the Jin-Cha-Ji border area. As a result, in addition to its own heavy casualties and losses, it did not gain anything. Since then, whether it was the Japanese army encircling and suppressing, or the Chinese army attacking, I don't know how many large and small contacts there have been. Every time, the Japanese army has heavy casualties and losses, while at the same time providing good development opportunities for the Chinese guerrilla troops. The largest scale of the past battles was the battle in September last year when the Japanese army coordinated 50,000 troops and more than a dozen routes to jointly attack Mount Wutai. However, the result was that the Japanese army suffered 20,000 casualties. The Jin-Cha-Ji guerrilla area is still standing still. At the time, the Japanese army's initial intention was to take advantage of the opportunity that the majority of the Chinese army was trying its best to defend Wuhan and had no time to take care of other things, to destroy the anti-Japanese base in North China in one fell swoop. But the result was that they failed to achieve their goal and annihilated a part of their elite. The past facts are like this, not to mention that China's anti-Japanese strength has been strengthened now, and not to mention that there is no opportunity like the Battle of Wuhan, what certainty does the Japanese army have to make the "mopping up" plan succeed?</p>
<h3>Initial Understanding Reached Between Britain and Japan, Preparing for Formal Negotiations on the Tianjin Incident; Both Sides Will Jointly Issue a Declaration Explaining the Basis and Scope of the Negotiations; Draft Principles Agreed Upon in the Previous Talks Have Been Approved by the Japanese Cabinet</h3>

As for the current basis and scope of the negotiations, Britain and Japan will jointly issue a declaration in Tokyo within a short period to explain it. (Havas Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo, British diplomatic sources recently stated that when Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie continues his talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita tomorrow, they may agree on a formal negotiation schedule. Both sides will also issue a joint announcement, the content of which will be more detailed and precise than today's announcement. Generally, the scope of the formal negotiations, while slightly smaller than Japan's wishes, is larger than Britain's initial proposals. Regarding the Tianjin issue, both sides are expected to agree on (1) joint cooperation between the British and Japanese authorities in the area to suppress terrorist activities, and (2) that the British Concession will maintain complete neutrality under British sovereignty regarding other issues. However, it is currently unknown whether the issue of the four hundred and eighty million Chinese dollars of silver deposited by Chinese banks in the British Concession will be discussed. (Havas Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Reports on the talks between Britain and Japan in the East will be promptly communicated to the United States by the British government. When a reporter asked Secretary of State Cordell Hull about this today, he replied that he had issued a statement on June 19th of this year, stating that although the Tianjin incident was initially not related to the United States government, the developments and the nature of the issues involved were indeed of concern to the United States. The reporter was asked to review the statement. (Havas Agency, 20th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: The Japanese Cabinet held a special meeting in Tokyo on the morning of the 22nd, where Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita presented a report on the situation of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations. Afterward, the Cabinet approved the understanding reached between Britain and Japan on the general issues surrounding the Tianjin incident. In the afternoon, Prime Minister Nobuyuki Abe went to his villa to meet with the Emperor and report the results of the talks. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The British Ambassador and the Japanese Foreign Minister were originally scheduled to hold their fourth meeting today, but due to new instructions from London, the timing of the meeting is now uncertain. At the same time, the [local conference] on the Tianjin incident is expected to begin on Monday, July 20th. The Japanese representatives will be Kato, a counselor at the Embassy in [Manchukuo], and Tanaka, the consul in Tianjin. The British side will be represented by Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie and Herbert, the British Consul in Tianjin. Major General Muto, representing the Japanese army in North China, will also participate as needed. According to the Asahi Shimbun, the proceedings of this conference may take a considerable amount of time, but once a compromise is reached on the more important fundamental points, British and Japanese officials from Tianjin will return there to decide on the technical details of implementation on the ground. Since the beginning of the Anglo-Japanese negotiations, they have been on the verge of collapse due to Britain's firm opposition to Japan's main demands. However, it is reported that Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie expressed concessions yesterday, so there has been a new turning point. According to Japanese sources, as a result of the British Ambassador's concessions, an understanding has been reached on the various principles desired by Japan. The Asahi Shimbun stated that this change in the situation was due to the British Embassy receiving instructions from Downing Street yesterday morning. The newspaper also stated that the British have proven to be fully willing to resolve the issue peacefully, and have accepted the Japanese revised proposals without hesitation. It is reported that the ambassador urged Japan to stop anti-British actions and propaganda during yesterday's meeting, but the matter was postponed for decision. Various Japanese circles here do not believe that the British government will send instructions to the ambassador that contradict the attitude expressed by the British Ambassador during yesterday's meeting. The Foreign Ministry spokesman replied to questions yesterday, stating that the British Ambassador and the Japanese Foreign Minister now clearly understand each other's positions. When asked about Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's recent declaration in the House of Commons that Britain would never allow a foreign country to dictate its foreign policy, the spokesman replied that Japan had absolutely no intention of directing the British government's foreign policy. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to well-informed political figures, since the beginning of the Anglo-Japanese talks, they have achieved [a basis for useful discussion], but Britain's attitude should not be overly optimistic, as any concessions are accompanied by opposing demands. It is widely believed that the Japanese side will raise the issue of establishing a Chinese "central government," while the British side insists on maintaining British rights. According to well-informed sources, Japan's demands include the following points: (1) British recognition of the existing facts in China, (2) British maintenance of absolute neutrality, especially in military areas, and (3) British withdrawal of political influence over General Chiang Kai-shek's government in China. (Haitong News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to semi-official sources here, Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita and Ambassador Robert Craigie of Britain may issue a joint official announcement after holding their fourth meeting today. Well-informed sources claim that a compromise formula has been reached on the Tianjin dispute during yesterday's meeting, the content of which is as follows: (1) Both Britain and Japan recognize that the situation in Tianjin has been completely transformed due to the Sino-Japanese War, (2) Britain will not take any measures that endanger Japan's military position, and (3) Britain will take measures to maintain peace and order in Tianjin. It is said that this is a decision in principle, and the details will be further discussed at the Anglo-Japanese talks in Tianjin. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>Arita's Report to the Cabinet</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Today's special Cabinet meeting approved the draft principles of the Tianjin Incident agreed upon yesterday by Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita and British Ambassador Robert Craigie. It is reported that the Foreign Minister told the Cabinet that the general issues, especially regarding Britain's recognition of the measures taken by the Japanese army for security and the maintenance of peace and order, which were the most dangerous point in the Tokyo talks, were agreed upon during the third meeting with the British Ambassador on Friday. This is equivalent to Britain accepting Japan's proposals regarding the general issues forming the background of the Tianjin situation. The Foreign Minister also stated, "Now that the general issues forming the background of the Tianjin situation have been resolved, we can proceed to discuss the specific issues of the Tianjin dispute." After the Foreign Minister's report, the Cabinet unanimously approved the draft agreement reached by the Foreign Minister and the British Ambassador. Before the Cabinet adjourned at 9:40 this morning, Prime Minister Nobuyuki Abe told his colleagues that now that the general issues forming the background of the Tianjin situation have been resolved, the first phase of the Tokyo talks can be said to have come to an end. He also said that excessive optimism about the outcome of the talks should not be held, and reiterated his determination to proceed firmly in accordance with the government's established policy in order to achieve its objectives, and asked his colleagues to cooperate in this regard. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This morning, various political parties in the House of Representatives held a meeting and decided to select twenty-three members of each party to hold a joint meeting with government leaders on the 27th of this month to receive reports from Prime Minister Nobuyuki Abe and Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita on the progress of the Anglo-Japanese conference. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>British Newspaper Comments on the Negotiation Situation</p>
<p>(London) The Times stated in its editorial today that the Japanese Foreign Ministry's announcement yesterday that the atmosphere of the Tokyo negotiations had slightly improved suggests that the points raised by Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita on Sunday have been revised after British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain declared that he did not want to change his foreign policy under the direction of foreign governments or warlords, at least in wording. At the same time, facts in the North China situation, such as the overwhelming dominance of the Japanese in North China, the de facto occupation of major cities in North China by the Japanese army, and the Japanese demand that the existence of foreign concessions in North China should not endanger the safety of the Japanese army and pro-Japanese factions, need to be recognized. If the Japanese side refers to this as Britain's recognition of the "background," then it should be possible to find an approach to conduct detailed negotiations on the narrow issue of Tianjin. The British government can guarantee the neutrality of the concessions without losing its dignity, and investigate the possibility of the living conditions of the authorities in this neutral area and the Japanese army in the occupied areas of China. Although this approach is not easy to implement, especially when the areas occupied by the Japanese army have never been peaceful, diplomatic skills should not make this matter ultimately difficult. All that Britain can do is this; it cannot expect Britain to sacrifice its friends and principles to help the Japanese warlords get rid of the difficulties caused by their own miscalculations. At the same time, the Japanese side now understands the danger of falling into the Far Eastern trap. A dispatch from this newspaper in Tokyo contained the phrase "Tianjin is just a small scene on the side of the world drama." At the beginning of the Japanese army's attack on China, the fate of the Far East was decided at least for the next thirty years not in Nanjing or Tokyo. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Chongqing's Study of Britain's Attitude</p>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese authorities here are still studying the latest news from the Tokyo negotiations, and it is widely expected that they will issue a strong statement declaring that if Britain's acceptance of Japan's demands is true, it not only violates the principles of the Nine-Power Treaty and the League of Nations resolutions, but is also an extremely short-sighted policy, because this move by Britain will have a major adverse impact on British interests and prestige in the Far East. The Chinese public is not yet aware of the compromise in the Tokyo talks, and still believes that Britain will not compromise with Japan, but if Chinese newspapers publish all the facts tomorrow, a strong tide of resentment against Britain will arise throughout China. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>Negotiation Situation Shows Progress</p>
<p>The special correspondent of the North China Daily News reported from Tokyo on the 21st that the results of the talks between Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita and the British Ambassador this morning proved that the optimism predicted by the reporter's telegram on Wednesday was not wrong. British and Japanese officials believe that there has been great progress towards a successful outcome of the conference. The Tokyo stock exchange was very stable and strong when the market closed this afternoon, reflecting the great improvement in the atmosphere of the negotiations. The communiqué issued by the Information Bureau of the Foreign Ministry is as follows: Arita and Craigie held talks at the Foreign Minister's official residence at 11:05 this afternoon, and made some progress towards a compromise. The meeting adjourned at 12:45 and will reconvene tomorrow. The reporter heard that Craigie was quite pleased with the promising progress he had made throughout the process and returned to the embassy. The British Embassy feels that the negotiations are indeed moving forward. When the reporter asked whether this meant that Britain now recognized the "New Order in East Asia," he was told that it was too early to say. Responsible Japanese officials told reporters that the atmosphere has greatly improved, and the main difficulties seem to have been overcome, so the future is optimistic. The Japanese Cabinet is scheduled to hold a special meeting tomorrow to discuss Japan's attitude in tomorrow's talks. After the Cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Nobuyuki Abe will report the details to the Emperor, and Arita will also report to the leaders of both houses of parliament. The date of the report may be the 27th of this month. A 13-year-old female student in Osaka sent 5 yen to Arita so that Arita could buy eternal knot sweets and share them with Craigie. Arita returned the money and wrote to the girl, saying that she should use the money to buy war bonds. These two translations were presented to Craigie, who was very interested. The Foreign Ministry spokesman denied this morning that Japan had agreed to make any changes to its foreign policy. He concluded, however, by saying, "We want Britain to recognize that the situation in the Far East has changed and should act accordingly." This morning, Tokyo has prepared the stage for the continued Anglo-Japanese talks in the East to seek a solution to the urgent Tianjin problem. Although well-informed Japanese figures are not too hopeful of reaching a common basis for understanding, they all believe that today's talks are a critical juncture: either the two representatives will break down completely or enter into long-term negotiations, and the decision will be made today. According to Japanese military personnel, Britain's efforts to preserve its prestige are the main obstacle to the success of the negotiations, but Japan is determined to maintain its position in Tianjin. Even if Britain adopts a conciliatory attitude, but at the same time tries to maintain its face without fully recognizing the New Order in East Asia, the talks may break down. Tokyo military personnel have repeatedly stated that Tianjin is in the war zone, so it needs Britain's political and economic cooperation. It is necessary for the British authorities to adopt this attitude. Japan is unwilling to consider Britain's counter-proposals, and if Britain refuses to change its attitude, the Japanese authorities will not hesitate to stop the talks. Those who consulted with Japanese Foreign Minister Hachiro Arita yesterday included Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Sawada, Minister Kato, Director of the East Asia Bureau Kurihara, former Ambassador to Brazil Sawada, and former Ambassador to Italy Horita. The latter is known for his anti-British attitude. The Foreign Minister then had a long talk with Prime Minister Nobuyuki Abe, and it is reported that the two agreed to maintain the policy they had already stated for dealing with the Tianjin issue. At the same time, the leaders of both houses of the Japanese Diet asked about the future of the overall situation, and it is expected that Arita will answer these questions as soon as possible. According to Japanese newspapers, anti-British sentiment is rapidly approaching [boiling point], with rallies and marches held in almost every town and village to denounce [cunning Britain]. The Seiyukai is organizing rallies in Tokyo and Osaka, which will be held soon. In recent days, letters to Arita, Army Minister Itagaki, and other cabinet members have arrived like snowflakes, demanding a change in policy towards Britain. At the same time, there have also been letters to British Ambassador Craigie, demanding that Britain change its policy in China.</p>
<p>Germany Anxious</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to news from Tokyo, Britain and Japan seem to be likely to reach an agreement on various important issues. Political figures here originally thought that the negotiations would definitely fail, and newspapers also thought that the tense relations between Britain and Japan would definitely become serious. Now that there is news that a compromise may be reached, they are all anxious and deeply worried that Britain will have more freedom of action in Europe in the future. An economic magazine recently published an article that is quite noteworthy, the main point of which is to advise Japan not to please Britain and let its relations with Germany and Italy be affected. It says, "The future of relations between Britain and Japan has a very large relationship with Japan's foreign policy and the situation in China. Some people in Britain have talked about mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute again, giving Japan convenience, and exchanging it for the country's promise not to help Germany and Italy anymore. If so, then Britain is almost willing to sacrifice China in exchange for Japan's neutrality on European affairs. In short, the problems caused by the blockade of the British Concession in Tianjin are very broad in scope, and are sufficient to prove how closely the situation in the Far East and the situation in Europe are related. It can be seen that the benefits Japan has obtained from the Anti-Comintern Pact are very significant and should not be neglected. The reason is that whether Japan cooperates with Britain or not, it can achieve the same effect, and there is no need to cooperate with Britain. (Havas, 22nd)</p>
<p>French Newspapers Hope Britain Will Be Tough</p>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the negotiations between Britain and Japan in Tokyo to resolve the Tianjin dispute, political figures here have paid close attention after receiving reports that partial understanding has been reached. [Le Temps] has adopted the toughest attitude towards Japan's demands, strongly declaring that Britain must not accept them. The newspaper declared that [Japan has absolutely no intention of changing its policy of monopolizing China. According to unconfirmed news, Japan held an Imperial Conference on July 14, and at that time it decided on the conditions for Anglo-Japanese understanding: (1) Britain should cooperate with the Nanjing [Reformed Government], (2) Prevent arms from being transported from Burma to China, (3) Withdraw British military instructors in China, (4) Britain will lend 100 million pounds to Japan for the development of China's economy, (5) The scope of British interests in China, (6) Britain and Japan will sign a 25-year non-aggression pact. The newspaper insisted that these terms cannot be accepted. Although Britain hopes to avoid a major conflict in the Far East, it cannot change its current policy. The left-wing newspapers mostly criticized Britain for not softening towards Japan. From this point of view, France almost hopes that Britain will adopt a tough attitude in the Far East. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>Japanese Newspapers Praise Britain's Courtesy</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Tokyo newspapers have recently been heavily promoting the results of the Anglo-Japanese talks. [Asahi Shimbun] stated that Britain's [courtesy] this time was unprecedented in the history of British diplomacy, and went on to say that the results of the talks include the following points: (1) Britain recognizes the current situation in China, (2) Britain promises not to take actions that disturb Japan or help General Chiang Kai-shek, and (3) Britain instructs its representatives in China not to take the above actions. The newspaper declared that Britain had cancelled its counter-proposals and fully accepted Japan's demands. This sudden change of attitude is based on the following reasons: (1) Difficult international situation, increasingly unfavorable to Britain, (2) Failure of the Moscow talks, (3) Failure of the United States to revise the Neutrality Act. The newspaper and [Hochi Shimbun] believe that based on the above three reasons, Britain softened towards Japan. [Kokumin Shimbun] believes that over-optimism is not warranted, and that the difficulties encountered in the implementation of any agreement are far greater than during the negotiations, such as the Munich Conference is not far away. (Haitong News Agency, 21st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Recently, newspapers here have warned against being overly optimistic about the Tokyo talks. The Asahi Shimbun reported that financial figures expressed satisfaction with the fact that Britain and Japan had agreed on the general issues forming the background of the Tianjin situation. The newspaper advocated adopting a [wait-and-see] policy towards the specific issues of the Tianjin incident, saying that what needs to be resolved now is Britain's cooperation with the [Peiping Government], especially the prohibition of the circulation of Chinese legal tender and the [Peiping Government]'s statistics on the business of Chinese banks within the British Concession in Tianjin. The Continued Selling News reported that the focus of the dispute lies in the discussion of the specific issues regarding Tianjin. Miyako Shimbun admired the statesmanship shown by Britain in reaching a compromise on the general issues of the Tianjin incident, but Hochi Shimbun was quite dissatisfied with the conciliatory attitude shown by Foreign Minister Arita and the British Ambassador in agreeing on the general issues forming the background of the Tianjin incident.

<h3>Another Aerial Battle on the Outer Mongolian Border; Information from the Japanese Kwantung Army</h3>
<p>(Changchun) According to news received here, another fierce aerial battle occurred on the [Manchukuo]-Mongolian border yesterday. According to a report from the headquarters of the Japanese Kwantung Army, the Japanese Air Force, patrolling over Lake Buir, engaged in an aerial battle with 80 Soviet planes. As a result, 39 Soviet Russian planes were shot down, and the Japanese side lost only 3 planes. (Haitong Dispatch, 22nd)</p>

<h3>The Chongqing United Daily News Analyzes the Foreign Exchange Situation; The People Should Not Be Alarmed; The Government Has a Fixed Policy</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chongqing United Daily News today analyzed the foreign exchange situation in detail, mentioning the possibility that the Chinese government may devalue the foreign exchange value of the legal tender, saying that the government can strictly control the import of foreign goods and vigorously encourage exports to prevent the Japanese from absorbing China's foreign exchange reserves and gaining a trade surplus. Since Japan realized the failure of its military adventures in China, it established the United Reserve Bank in North China to prohibit the circulation of legal tender, and established the Wah Hing Commercial Bank in Shanghai to resort to economic warfare. At the same time, the Japanese side intensified its naval blockade of Fuzhou, Wenzhou and Shantou, plundered legal tender in North China, took it to Shanghai to buy foreign exchange, and exported products from southeastern China. Originally, the foreign exchange value of legal tender was relatively high. When the war first started, the government authorities were afraid that lowering the foreign exchange rate of legal tender would cause public misunderstanding and anxiety. Therefore, the Chinese government has supported the foreign exchange market for two years now. When a country is at war, the most important thing is to obtain a trade surplus, and there are only two ways to achieve a trade surplus: (1) Prohibit the import of all non-war necessities, (2) Devalue the foreign exchange value of legal tender. Today, the Japanese are attacking legal tender, and we can use this opportunity to devalue the foreign exchange value of legal tender. As for what level the Chinese government will accept as a reasonable foreign exchange rate for legal tender, this is the most complicated issue and depends on China's trade situation and the international trade situation. Under the current circumstances, we will accept it as a reasonable level when the legal tender reaches a level that the Japanese cannot absorb our foreign exchange reserves. The Chinese people should not be alarmed about the foreign exchange situation, because the Chinese government has its own fixed policies and procedures for currency development. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The Times commented on Chinese legal tender, saying that it is very clear that the amount of money that the Exchange Equalization Fund Committee can dispose of is insufficient. Will it now let the legal tender rise and fall on its own without providing assistance, or will it invest more money that can cope with the difficult situation? The authorities must choose one of these two. The British government clearly believes that it is necessary to first consult with other countries that have significant commercial relations with China, such as the United States, before deciding on a solution. If other countries with significant commercial relations, such as the United States, are unwilling to participate in the continued efforts to maintain the stability of legal tender, it would be a strange thing. If the legal tender collapses, the commercial interests of all countries will perish together. It is thought that other countries besides Britain must not be unmoved by this scene of commercial decline. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the Japanese Cabinet discussed the fall of Chinese legal tender when it met yesterday. Finance Minister Kazuo Shiina said that the main reason for the decline was the withdrawal of British support, and said that this situation will seriously affect China's customs duties. It is urgently necessary for Japan to take measures to protect China's "new currency." (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Saying That Chang Kia-ngau Was Executed Is Entirely a Rumor</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Japanese claim that Minister of Communications Chang Kia-ngau has been executed is purely a fabrication, and its childishness is ridiculous. Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, Chang Kia-ngau has made contributions to the maintenance of old transportation lines and the opening of new highways and railways in the southwest, which are known to everyone. In addition, Chang Kia-ngau's extraordinary loyalty to the war of resistance is sufficient to arouse Japan's jealousy. Japan originally planned to split the internal front of the Chinese government, but its plan was not successful, so it began to spread the rumor that he had been executed. (Associated Press, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Officials here have firmly denied the Japanese claim that Minister of Communications Chang Kia-ngau has been "executed." A Reuters reporter saw Chang Kia-ngau leaving his residence by car yesterday. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>The Saying That the Minister of Finance Will Be Replaced Is Absolutely Absurd</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Regarding rumors that the Minister of Finance will be replaced, Chinese officials told a Reuters reporter today that the saying is absolutely absurd. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Weekly War Situation: July 14th to 20th</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The spokesperson of the Military Affairs Commission stated that since this week, the enemy's offensive on the northern and southern battlefields has gradually stalled. The enemy's self-proclaimed "mopping-up campaign" in southeastern Shanxi has been hindered by continuous rain, making large-scale troop movements difficult. Our troops, dispersing and concentrating as needed, have kept the enemy constantly on the run, unable to attend to everything. The enemy's plot to clear the rear in order to engage in so-called "long-term construction" has suffered a severe blow and is gradually heading towards failure. The important aspects of the operations are described below:</p>
<p>Guangdong Front</p>
<p>The enemy in Xinhui, Jiangmen, and the West River has been continuously dispatching enemy ships for days, attempting to land at locations such as Koushi, Quanlu, and Jinzhong on the sea. Additionally, they have been advancing from Rongqi and Guizhou towards Xiaolan, attempting a pincer attack on Zhongshan from both land and sea. After fierce attacks in various directions, the enemy has not succeeded in their aims. A portion of the enemy forces in Longkou, North River, advanced from Pingshan towards Lianglong. Our attacking forces made contact with the enemy at Lianglong. Subsequently, the enemy increased to over a thousand, and dispatched over eight hundred infantry and cavalry through He'anli to Qiling City, attempting to encircle our right flank. After repeated bloody battles in the Niuguling and Shibalin areas, over six hundred enemies were killed. The enemy's momentum was greatly reduced, and the remaining enemies are now retreating in different directions. On the East River, our forces advanced towards Chao'an. Caught off guard, the enemy retreated along the Han River in southeast directions. Consequently, on the 14th and 15th, we successively recovered Tuopu, Pengzhou, Longhu, Anbu, Fuyang, and Fengxi, establishing strongholds in each. On the 16th, we launched an attack to the south, first recovering Yixi and then pressing towards Chao'an city. After a bloody battle until dawn on the 17th, our soldiers fought bravely and completely destroyed the enemy's defensive works, breaking in from the north of the city. The remaining enemy fled towards the south of the city. We temporarily recovered the county seat. Many important enemy senior headquarters Yingzhou Inn generals did not have time to escape and were all annihilated. A large enemy force is currently being organized to reinforce and counterattack, and a fierce battle is unfolding.</p>
<p>Shanxi Front</p>
<p>Our forces and the enemy are still engaged in fierce fighting in southeastern Shanxi. The focus of military operations has now shifted to the Changzhi and Jincheng area. Since the beginning of the month, the enemy has mobilized five divisions and one brigade, launching a large-scale encirclement of the Taihang Mountains, advancing south along the Baijin Highway. Over 20,000 enemies successively captured our Qin County, Wu Township, Yu Township, Liao County, and other strongholds. We engaged the enemy in fierce battles on both sides of the highway and sent strong forces to break through behind enemy lines. Liao County was once recovered, while Yu Township, Wu Township, and Liyuan were completely captured by us. The enemy advancing east from Qin County and along the Hongtun Avenue successively captured Tunliu, Changzi, and Changzhi. Enemy traces have also been discovered near Yincheng Town, south of Changzhi. For days, our surprise troops have been fiercely attacking the enemy's rear on the Hongtun Highway, causing the enemy great anxiety. Over 10,000 enemies advancing east from Yicheng along the Yiqin Highway, after capturing Qinshui, Dongfeng, and Yangcheng, now have their main force in the eastern bank of Qinshui area. A portion has crossed the river and is advancing east, coordinating with the enemy moving north from Boai, attempting to attack Jincheng. The battle has now entered its most critical stage. The enemy who fled She County from Handan and advanced to Dongyangguan, after three days of intense fighting, has had its momentum blunted. They are now continuously receiving reinforcements, appearing to continue advancing towards Licheng. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>New Incident Occurs on the Border, Polish-Danzig Relations Become Tense Again, Polish Border Guard Shot and Killed, Polish Government Lodges Strong Protest with Danzig</h3>
<p>Warsaw - The authorities here released an official report yesterday regarding the shooting of a Polish border guard at the Polish-Danzig border, stating, "Regarding the shooting death of Polish border guard Butkiewicz at Trykanski on the Polish-Danzig border, the Polish government has instructed the High Commissioner stationed in Danzig to lodge a strong protest with the Danzig City Council, and has notified the City Council that Polish authorities have ordered border guards to return fire immediately if there are any border crossings." (Haitong Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>Warsaw - A German customs officer from the Free City of Danzig, Lippski, entered Polish territory without authorization this morning and was subsequently arrested by Polish border authorities. (Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>Warsaw - Regarding the shooting death of a Polish border guard by a Danzig customs officer, the Polish government has lodged a strong protest with the Danzig City Council, stating, in summary, that the incident occurred within Polish territory because Butkiewicz was preventing three Germans from illegally crossing the border, requesting an investigation and punishment of the culprit. It is reported that the murderer is a member of the National Socialist stormtroopers. Yesterday, the Danzig Customs Director was arrested by Polish police for illegal border crossing. According to Polish newspapers, Father Wisking, a Polish candidate in the former Danzig parliament, and two Polish railway employees were arrested by Danzig police for anti-National Socialist activities. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Poland Reaffirms Determination to Defend National Sovereignty</h3>
<p>Warsaw - A spokesperson for the Polish Foreign Ministry stated last night that if Germany insists on its demand to rule the Free City, a peaceful resolution to the Danzig crisis seems impossible. The spokesperson was responding to a public statement made in Berlin by a spokesperson for the National Socialist Party that Germany firmly believes that it can rule Danzig without resorting to war. The Polish spokesperson declared, "Poland will regard any attempt by Germany to annex Danzig as an infringement upon the legal and political status of the Free City." Under such circumstances, Poland will inevitably be forced to take "necessary actions to resist." (Associated Press Telegram, 22nd) A Polish official spokesperson declared that General Liz-Smigly, the Inspector General of the Polish Army, recently issued a statement saying that if peaceful methods fail, Poland will go to war for Danzig, and those who hope to use means to separate Danzig from Poland without a fight should read Liz's statement carefully. The spokesperson also stated that the current situation is quite serious, and whether Europe can avoid a bloody tragedy depends entirely on the attitude of German leaders. People all hope for peace, but it must be understood that Poland is not making empty threats. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Attempt to Annex Danzig, German Policy Remains Unchanged, Berlin Releases a Smokescreen of Peace, British and French People Are Not Deceived</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Political circles predict that there will be no developments in the Danzig issue this week. The German spokesperson's statement to foreign journalists yesterday that Hitler intends to acquire Danzig without using force has surprisingly attracted a great deal of attention. This is nothing more than a reaffirmation of Germany's firm attitude and is neither a new development nor a change of policy. According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent in London, London is very concerned about this spokesperson's remarks. The German government's claim that it wishes to make the Nuremberg Nazi Party Congress in September a "Peace Congress" seems to have no credible reason. As far as the British government is concerned, its position has been stated by the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary, and there is no need to reiterate it. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Paris) All sectors in France find it strange that a certain spokesperson in Berlin told foreign journalists that while Hitler is absolutely determined to obtain Danzig, he is also absolutely mindful of obtaining Danzig without war, and they do not believe that these are sincere words. Le Petit Parisien newspaper stated, "Another balloon has fallen to the ground." The British people are not deceived. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the question of the Free City of Danzig, official sources here recently declared, "There is no room for compromise in the resolution of this issue other than unconditionally returning the Free City of Danzig to Germany. However, Germany still hopes to find a peaceful solution, as Germany has no intention of aggression and does not want to cause a crisis or war because of this issue." As for when and how Danzig will be merged with Germany, semi-official sources avoided disclosing anything, only stating that Germany can wait a few months for this issue, but cannot allow it to be delayed indefinitely. Foreign observers here commented on this. (Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the Danzig Free City issue, the British newspapers here recently commented on a statement issued yesterday by semi-official German sources stating that the country has no intention of resorting to war, and they all expressed indifference, mostly believing that this statement is intended to split the peace camp and deceive public opinion in various democratic countries. The diplomatic affairs reporter of The Times of London declared, "This statement by the German propaganda department, viewed in its entirety, is somewhat simplistic, making it difficult to take seriously. However, certain parts of it, which are reportedly drafted according to the wishes of Führer Hitler, are particularly important. In essence, it states that Germany is determined to obtain Danzig 'uncompromisingly' and 'unconditionally,' thereby issuing the first official declaration, planning to take military measures within Germany and Danzig, 'but their nature is defensive.'" The goal of this statement is obvious. In short, if any difficulties arise in the future, we and Poland should be held responsible. Furthermore, the implication of this statement is that Prime Minister Chamberlain, although he reiterated on the 10th of this month his willingness to guarantee the independence of Poland, and was supported by the entire nation, will not actually fulfill his promise. Upon hearing this, people here were quite indignant. Political circles view this as containing a kind of probing action, and if so, its effect will be very minimal. "The News Chronicle states," "This German statement has not changed the current situation in Danzig. The intention of the National Socialist Party is to hope that Britain will yield again on the Danzig issue, just as it yielded on the Czech issue before. However, this shows that these people still have a dangerous illusion and are stubbornly holding onto it. It should be known that the commitment that the British government has made to Poland is very clear. It is hoped that the National Socialist leaders will not mistakenly believe that Britain will allow them to seize Danzig, thus deceiving themselves." (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>Mutual Assistance Agreement Negotiations, Britain Makes Further Concessions to the Soviet Union, New Instructions to the British Ambassador to Moscow, German-Soviet Economic Negotiations Reopen</h3>
<p>(London) According to a Reuters diplomatic correspondent, the British government has issued new instructions to Sir Seeds, the British ambassador to the Soviet Union, to continue the negotiations on the anti-aggression pact between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in Moscow. It is reported that the British side consulted with the French government before issuing these instructions, and the content is the same as that given to the French ambassador to the Soviet Union, Naggiar. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) The content of the new instructions from the British government is reportedly to make further concessions to the Soviet Union, and to agree that a military agreement can be concluded at the same time as a political agreement, but it still does not allow a broad definition of the term "indirect aggression."

<p>(Moscow) The commercial credit negotiations between Germany and the Soviet Union, which was suspended, have resumed recently. The representative of the Soviet People's Committee for Foreign Trade is Babarin, the deputy commercial representative stationed in Berlin, and the German representative is Schnurre. (TASS Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the commercial and financial negotiations between German and Soviet representatives currently taking place in Berlin, Soviet officials here recently confirmed that the current negotiations will generally take some time before both sides can be satisfied. The German side stated that the amount of trade between Germany and the Soviet Union has decreased significantly compared to the past, and that the current negotiations are normal and necessary. (Note that the amount of trade between the two sides has decreased from 800 million marks to just under 100 million marks.) Observers added comments that German newspapers have avoided attacking the Soviet Union for several months and have taken the opportunity to praise Soviet foreign policy, which shows Germany's desire to improve relations with the Soviet Union. However, it is feared that progress can only be achieved economically. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>

This article is part of a campaign to make the entire country aware of the importance of the navy, which will be followed by a large naval exercise. The exercise in the Baltic Sea will be grand, and the special programs on July 24th will be the most enthusiastic. (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<h3>British and Polish Discuss Military Cooperation, Ironside Returns to England After Visit</h3>
<p>(London) British General Ironside returned here by plane from Warsaw yesterday. While in Warsaw, he discussed with the Polish General Staff the close cooperation between the British and Polish armies in Europe in the event of a major war. (Associated Press Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Yesterday, a German newspaper, in discussing General Ironside's visit to Warsaw, stated that Poland's current military situation, even with any amount of aid from Britain and France, is still no match for Germany. "The Polish people are clearly insufficient, industrialization is admittedly weak, and there is even a lack of sufficient automatic mechanization. All of the above is absolutely necessary for 20th-century warfare. The Polish army lacks all modern weapons. Even if Germany fights on both the eastern and western fronts, its advantages will still be overwhelmingly undeniable. Although British tanks will continue to be transported to Poland in the coming years, even if the Western powers continue to provide aid, even permanently stationed air force units, they can also play a decisive role, and large-scale transportation is not without technical difficulties. Therefore, the move to aid Poland will not produce significant results. In addition, the transfer of large quantities of arms will weaken the front lines of the Western powers themselves. The strategic position of the Polish border area is admittedly worse than its armed condition. Strategically speaking, the unfavorable position of the Polish border is unmatched in the world. Even if the Western powers possess a large army, they will find the Polish border indefensible. In the event of a real war, the Polish General Staff has only two options: willingly suffer complete destruction or retreat with the entire army to the Soviet Union. British experts can only advise Poland to rely on its own efforts, and Britain can at most assist with a blockade." The newspaper also stated that if Britain implements a blockade during a major war, the German air force will be "completely uninterested" in Britain. The newspaper further stated, "Only after many years of war can a blockade slightly assist Poland, but by this time Poland will have long been occupied by other countries."

<p>(London) Former Director of Finance of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Ford, who has now come to England to take on an important financial position in London, expressed his opinion today, believing that Japan is now gradually realizing the failure of its adventurous actions in China. He said, "Japan will regret attacking China and is now deliberately trying to involve Britain in the conflict in order to find an opportunity to extricate itself. Although China's future has great difficulties, I think China will definitely be revived, and Britain should help it revive." (Reuters Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Germany Artificial, Greatly Lacking, Many Women Abandon Pianos, Engage in Typewriter Life</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Since the implementation of the arms expansion plan, there has been a deep sense of labor shortage. The number of female workers employed in various factories and institutions has been increasing. Among the 400,000 staff employed by various banks and insurance companies, women account for as many as 102,000. The situation in other industries is also the same. This situation is directly contrary to the proposition announced by Führer Hitler and his subordinates that women should stay at home. However, there is nothing that can be done. To this day, newspapers have changed their arguments, advising women across the country to participate in various work related to social welfare and not to engage in unconscious leisure. The Nazi Party organ newspaper, Völkischer Beobachter, published a commentary with the title "From Piano to Typewriter," stating in summary, "Most of the positions in various institutions that are held by men can be replaced by women." According to reliable sources, women will be employed as ticket sellers on trams and buses across the country. (Havas Telegram, 22nd)</p>

<h3>Neutrality Act Amendment Stalled, American Commerce and Industry Adversely Affected, Unable to Help Countries Opposing Aggression, Roosevelt Says Isolationists Should Bear Full Responsibility</h3>
<p>Hyde Park - President Roosevelt recently spoke to the newspapers about the Neutrality Act issue, stating, in summary, that delaying the discussion of this issue until the next session of Congress seems harmful to commerce and industry. Some people in the business community have told me that there are signs of recovery in various industries, but because Congress is unwilling to submit the Neutrality Act issue to a vote during this session, they have stagnated again, because people in various industries are taking a wait-and-see attitude before the new Neutrality Act is enacted. The President also stated that after Congress adjourns, only an extremely tense situation in Europe would be a sufficient reason to convene a special session of Congress to discuss the Neutrality Act issue. Foreign countries have repeatedly discovered threats of war, but wars have not occurred in the end, and it is still uncertain whether this will continue in the future. However, according to the existing arms embargo provisions, the United States is unable to help countries opposing aggression, which is also known to the Senators. Their reason for agreeing to postpone the discussion of the Neutrality Act issue is that they assume that war will not break out. In short, the debate on the Neutrality Act issue can be said to have come to an end before Congress reconvenes in 1940. Certain senators have formed a group, determined to oppose it, causing the possibility of the problem not being submitted for discussion to be postponed until the resumption. For this reason, I do not intend to seek justice from public opinion, but it is clear that the isolationists are willing to bear full responsibility for this matter. (Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<h3>US Retaliation Against Japan, Believes It Is Not Yet the Time, Secretary of State Hull Responds to Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Does Not Express Opinion on Pittman Bill for Now</h3>
<p>(Washington) Government officials declared last night that before the end of this session of Congress, the United States will not take legislative action to resist Japan's infringement upon American rights and interests in China in retaliation against Japan. Secretary of State Hull declared yesterday that because Congress wishes to adjourn, he intends to wait until the next session of Congress in January 1940 to express his opinion on the Pittman bill to ban arms exports, which seeks to authorize the President to ban arms exports to Japan in order to oppose Japan's destruction of the Nine-Power Treaty. Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stated that because Hull has issued the above public announcement, this session of Congress does not intend to take any action on his bill. Hull's letter to Pittman stated that the President intends to "consider in detail and thoroughly" Republican Senator Vandenberg's proposal to abolish the 1911 US-Japan Treaty of Commerce and Friendship. He stated that Congress must first pass a bill requesting the President to consider Vandenberg's proposal. (Associated Press Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently suggested banning the transportation of arms to Japan. Because the committee feared that this matter would conflict with the 1911 treaty between the United States and Japan, it asked Secretary of State Hull for his opinion. The reply has been received, and the requested information has been avoided, only stating that Congress is unlikely to make a decision on the proposal to ban the transport of arms to Japan during this session, which seems "obvious." For this reason, it seems that the State Department should postpone expressing its opinion for the time being. After receiving this letter, Pittman immediately made a statement saying that there is nothing that can be done about my proposal at this time. Once the Foreign Relations Committee meets on the 26th of this month, I will request that the case be temporarily shelved and restudied after Congress resumes. (Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Michigan Republican Senator Vandenberg proposed the other day that the US government should convene the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty to hold another meeting to determine whether Japan has destroyed the Nine-Power Treaty and whether it is continuing to do so. Secretary of State Hull recently sent a letter to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, stating that the State Department is considering this proposal in a careful and thorough manner. (Havas Telegram, 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the Pittman proposal to ban the transport of arms to Japan, Secretary of State Hull recently sent a letter to the Foreign Relations Committee, stating that the State Department should postpone expressing its attitude for the time being. Diplomatic circles here recently added comments, stating that it can be seen from this that the State Department is unwilling to cause a public debate on the subtle issue of US-Japan relations. Fortunately, President Roosevelt enjoys the necessary power, and if Japan's attitude must be retaliated against, the United States can impose restrictive measures on that country, but now is not the time.

<h3>Mexico's Internal Affairs: Omnipotent Political Party Rises; Receives Full Support from Dictatorial Countries; Conspiracy to Overthrow the Current Political System</h3>
<p>Mexico City: A certain leftist leader in the Mexican capital told a Havas News Agency interviewer that a new omnipotent political party has been formed within the country. It has received full assistance from various dictators, and its power is growing daily. Therefore, a revolution may occur in the country, which is not impossible. This new party has 4,000 members and was established 18 months ago. Its leader is former cabinet member Oteiza (a confidant of former President Cárdenas). Its political program is completely opposite to anarchism but has many similarities to Brazil's "Estado Novo" (New State). Anarchism seeks to overthrow all governments, while this party not only wants to overthrow the current Mexican government but also wants to establish an omnipotent government. Its birthplace is León (in Guanajuato Province). It now has great influence in the central provinces and has recently established branches in the capital and San Luis Potosí. Its organization is of a semi-military nature, and members must undergo rigorous training. The central idea it espouses is that "the individual should sacrifice for the benefit of the party." It has recently been reported that a large number of arms have been secretly shipped in from overseas, so the party already has complete military equipment. However, its purpose is unknown, and it is impossible to know what position it will take in the upcoming presidential election. In addition, the Mexican Revolutionary Party, the Communist Party, and the People's Welfare Party all maintain close ties with it. (Havas, 21st)</p>

<h3>Suzhou After the Fall: Commerce is Exceptionally Bleak; Silver and Banking Industries Almost Completely Shut Down; Embroidered Goods are Unwanted</h3>
<p>Suzhou Correspondence: Suzhou was originally a prosperous area, with ten miles of bustling streets, indulgence, and extravagance. Since its fall, one year and ten months have passed, and all of Suzhou's commerce has declined and suffered a setback. The recent commercial situation is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>Silver and Banking Industry</p>
<p>In Suzhou, the Guanqian Street area is the concentration of banks, and Zhongshi Street is the gathering area of money shops. Before the war, these two places held the leading position in the commercial world. Since the westward movement of the Chinese army in the Battle of Shanghai, various banks such as the Bank of China and the Agricultural Bank withdrew, and the remaining houses were either bombed or burned down. Recently, "Hwa Hsing Bank" has set up a branch on the old site of Jiangsu Bank. Most of the money shops have closed down. Until the early July of this year, Yuan Yu, Hui Feng Yu Sheng, Hwa Feng, Hui Tai, and Tong Hui reopened. They have to report the loan amounts to the "puppet government" every day.</p>
<p>Silverware Industry</p>
<p>Before the war, there were more than 100 silverware shops in Suzhou, and there was an organization of the trade association. The capital was also quite strong. For example, Heng Fu, Tian Cheng, Tian Feng Heng, and Lao Wannian each had more than 100,000 capital, and the annual business reached more than 100,000 yuan. Various shops such as Jue Deng had a capital of 10,000 to 20,000 yuan, and the business was also tens of thousands of yuan. During the fall, Tian Cheng was destroyed. Although the other shops were not completely destroyed, they were all looted. The losses of the shops are difficult to count. Now Heng Fu has resumed business, and the others are barely supporting themselves. Their business only has income and earns some meager profits to maintain a living. There is no fixed capital for each shop, and most of them are just barely surviving.</p>
<p>Embroidery Industry</p>
<p>This industry is famous in Suzhou, such as dance costumes, pillows, cheongsams, opera costumes, etc., embroidered with various patterns of flowers, animals, and scenery by hand, so it is famous at home and abroad. Except for Xiang embroidery, Su embroidery is often promoted. Before the war, there were several specialized operators, such as Jian Renhe, Gan Taixiang, Datong, Hongda, and Tangjia Lane. Their business was quite developed, and the profits were large. The sales were mainly in Shanghai, and various ports in Southeast Asia, reaching more than 100,000 yuan every year. Now foreign sales are weak, raw materials are expensive, and wages have been reduced, but sales are still difficult. Except for Gan Taixiang and Tong Renhe, which have not resumed business, although the rest are engaged in the industry, their livelihood has fallen sharply. The embroiderers in this industry are all daughters of small families. Before the war, there were about 1,000 people. Recently, transactions are far less than before. Even if the cost is reduced, the wages of embroidery are low, such as 2 yuan per pair of pillow wages before, and now only 7 jiao, no one asks.</p>
<p>Silk Fabric Industry</p>
<p>There are now more than 100 large and small stores inside and outside Guanqian City. The business is divided into two types. One is mainly silk fabrics, such as Gan Taixiang, Tong Renhe, etc., and also operate foreign goods. The other is mainly silk and cotton fabrics, such as Xie Ji, Dayou Heng, Xie Da Xiang, Da Feng, etc., and also have silk makers. The sources are from Shanghai, Hangzhou, and Huzhou, and cotton cloth is from Changzhou and Wuxi. In the past, Suzhou had a kind of pure warp satin and plain satin, which were famous products, but now they have been eliminated. After the war, although the silk weaving factories have resumed business, the products are not enough to meet the market demand, so each silk fabric industry purchases goods from Shanghai. However, most of the Shanghai silk fabric pieces are white, and those with large capital are all dyed with strips, and those with small capital are purchased for ready-made colored pieces to save dyeing costs. However, the prices have increased several times, and the transportation costs and taxes are more than three times higher than before the war. Now people's economy is difficult, purchasing power is low, and there is competition in the industry, so the business situation is also very difficult.</p>
<p>Silk Industry</p>
<p>The silk industry is a special product of China. The export of raw silk has always been the crown of the world. Suzhou silk factories were the most prosperous, with more than 100 factories. Among them, the Zhenya, Suzhou and Yanling factories have the most capital and scale. During the war, Yanling was destroyed, and the rest were small family formats. The losses are difficult to count. Now, although a few have resumed business, they mostly rely on the Shanghai silk industry. Recently, raw materials are expensive, and they are only maintaining expenses. In addition, other industries are mostly bleak.</p>
<h3>3,000 Chinese Troops Arrive West of Shanghai; Japanese Army Actively Strengthening Defenses</h3>
<p>Qingpu Correspondence: A part of the New Fourth Army, active between Suzhou and Zhenjiang, was ordered to cross the river from Baimao Estuary on the 15th, and arrived in western Shanghai via circuitous routes. The total number is 3,000. On the 20th, a military conference of guerrillas in western Shanghai was convened, hoping to coordinate and launch a strong counterattack. Therefore, the Japanese army in the suburbs of Shanghai has been unusually panicked in recent days. In addition to actively strengthening defenses in western Shanghai, they are also digging trenches and rushing to build fortresses in the Jigan Cemetery and the Hongqiao Airport area. Travelers traveling on the Qinghu Road, regardless of men and women, are subject to strict inspections. The questioning of strong men is particularly strict.</p>
<h3>Chinese Troops in Jiashan Plan to Attack the Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Jiashan Correspondence: JiaShan North Xitangbo, has long been guarded by the 45th brigade of the Chinese army, Tian Kunshan. Previously, a Jiangbei boat was seized outside Beidang, and a perennial Japanese pass was found, with thousands of copper coins. When he was taken to the brigade headquarters for strict interrogation, he began to tell the truth about buying copper coins for the Japanese. Commander Tian then cut off the heads of five men and women in the whole boat. On the one hand, he sent his subordinates to strictly investigate the water and land transportation agencies. Recently, the 62nd regular army division arrived in Xitang in large numbers from Jinshan Bay. The Japanese army headquarters in Jiaxing was aware of the matter, and the troops from Songjiang and Jiashan were assembled, and the puppet army Chen Ayu's troops invaded Xitang in three routes. The Chinese army had withdrawn from the town in its entirety two days ago. When the Japanese army arrived in the town, they searched for four hours, and there was indeed no trace of the Chinese army. So they marched toward Yuhui, Dingdang, and other places, attempting to invade Liantang. Unexpectedly, while passing through Heshangdang, the Chinese army ambushed from all sides, and rushed out from the water and land. The two sides fought fiercely in the marshes for a day and a night. The Japanese army set fire to nearby large villages such as Zhuguanwan, Dongtang Village, and Muxing Yangjiabang, and many farmers were killed. The Japanese army took the opportunity to escape. As of yesterday, the Chinese army in Xitang was afraid that the Japanese army would come back for revenge, and planned not to defend the place, but to gather elsewhere.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province to Reorganize Civil Groups Starting Next Month; Deadline of Three Months for Completion</h3>
<p>Xinghua Correspondence: The Political Department of the Military Commission, in order to enrich the organization of civil groups in various places, concentrate the strength of civil groups in various places, and adapt to the needs, specially formulated the "Wartime Civil Group Xinli Measures", ordering the commanders of various war zones to preside over them, and jointly handle them with the provincial and municipal party departments and government mobilization committees. After receiving the order, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Lu-Su War Zone immediately approved and handed over the task to the Political Training Office of the Headquarters. The Political Training Office held a symposium with relevant agencies a few days ago. Those who attended included Section Chief Xu of the Provincial Government, Group Leader Lu of the Provincial Mobilization Committee, Section Chief Ou of the Provincial Party Department, and Director Liu of the Political Training Office. The decisions were: 1. The reorganization and implementation period starts from August 1st and must be completed within three months. The registration period is from August 1st to September 15th. The assessment period is from September 16th to September 30th. The adjustment period is from October 1st to October 30th. The regulations for the reorganization and implementation methods are: A. Draft a registration form. B. The headquarters sends a letter to the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government, and transfers it to the county party departments and county governments to handle registration procedures. C. After the assessment and adjustment registration is completed, further discussions will be held. 3. It is recommended that the Provincial Party Department draft a registration form, which will be issued after being approved by the co-organizing agencies.</p>

<h3>Two Newspaper Offices Suddenly Attacked; Multiple People Killed in the Business District; Sino-American Defenses Alert, No Damage Sustained; One Worker Killed and Two Injured at the Da Wan Bao; Detectives Engage in Fierce Gunfight with Thugs</h3>
<p>More Than Ten Passersby Wounded; One Foreigner Killed</p>
<p>In the Changgeng Lane of Edward Road (next to the Thai Times), at around 8:25 PM last night, a case of thugs making trouble at newspaper offices suddenly occurred. These people also carried weapons and fired over a hundred shots, injuring many innocent people, causing deep concern in both concessions. The detailed process is described below:</p>
<p>Hired Cars Assembled and Departed: At around 8:05 PM last night, more than 20 men dressed in Qing cloth long and short shirts and trousers, pretending not to know each other, went in batches to rent cars at the Jing'an Temple Yunfei Car Station. A total of four outbound cars were supplied by the station, with rental licenses No. 12301, No. 12302, No. 12293, and 12235. After renting the cars, these people instructed the drivers to drive the cars to Yidingpan Road in West Shanghai. They stopped briefly near the cross-border section of the road. The people in the cars were seen busily getting on and off, and soon the drivers were ordered to drive the cars to Edward Road and Zhubaosan Road.</p>
<p>Get Out of the Car and Rush Directly to the Sino-American Daily: The car drivers were not concerned at the time, because they were hired, and they should be ordered to do so. They drove to Edward Road according to orders. When they were near Zhubaosan Road, they were ordered to stop. The thugs got out of the cars and rushed into No. 130 Changgeng Lane. It was found that the Da Wan Bao and the Sino-American Daily were located in this house. After these people entered the house, three men dressed in Qing cloth short shirts and trousers led the way and attacked the Sino-American Daily on the third floor. These people carried weapons, such as box guns, pistols, and hand grenades, all in their hands, and were about to carry out their demolition attempt. At the critical moment, a Sino-American tea boy stepped up to the stairs and saw a group of people coming in groups, with weapons. Knowing that something was wrong, he quickly closed the gate at the end of the stairs.</p>
<p>Eyewitnesses Talk About Attacking Sino-American Daily: According to eyewitnesses at the time, when the thugs attacked the Sino-American Daily, they saw three men in the lead, dressed in black Xiangyun gauze short shirts and trousers, wearing white straw hats, each with a wooden shell gun in his hand. After the tea boy closed the gate at the end of the stairs, these people opened fire. At that time, a man in a suit was seen holding a gun in each hand, shouting and roaring. In addition, another person was holding a red flag, waving and guiding, like a commander.</p>
<p>Da Wan Bao Workers Injured</p>
<p>Seeing that the matter was revealed, these people opened fire at the end of the stairs. Then, a group of guns fired together, shooting at the end of the stairs. Suddenly, bullets rained down, like a battlefield, but the stair door was not opened. Seeing that the matter was unsuccessful, these people saw that the typesetting room of the Da Wan Bao was open, and turned to the typesetting room of the Da Wan Bao to carry out the disruption, and continuously fired inside. Therefore, three typesetting workers of the Da Wan Bao, Wang Xiwen, Gu Xinquan, etc., were injured on the spot. At this time, the police agencies of the Public Concession and the French Concession had already received the report, and the area near Changgeng Lane was already crowded with people, making a mess. The siren of the post office also responded in unison, so in an instant, the fully armed detectives of the two concessions had gathered.</p>
<p>Thugs Ran Out and Forced the Car to Speed Away: The perpetrators heard the news from the outside and withdrew and tried to escape. When they ran out of Changgeng Lane, they rushed in all directions. However, the French Concession detectives had blocked Zhubaosan Road and other places, and the Public Concession detectives had already blocked the road to the west, and concentrated their firepower to attack the perpetrators. The thugs fled in panic, and ran eastward while fighting. When they reached the vicinity of Sichuan Road, several of them jumped into the car with invoice number 12235, and ordered the driver to drive north quickly. When they reached the intersection of Hankou Road, they ordered them to turn west again. At that time, the driver had already seen what he was facing, but was controlled by force and could not get rid of it, so he had to let the perpetrators sway. However, in this very short time, the sound of gunfire in that section of the area was already indistinguishable, and bullets rained down, which was enough to write the image at that time, and the innocent victims were already everywhere.</p>
<p>Stopped Midway and Opened Fire to Resist Arrest: When the car with number 12235 was flying west along Hankou Road, it happened to meet the 156th Western Patrol of the Old Gate Patrol House, led by 3 Chinese patrols, No. 1079, No. 1144, and No. 1869, who were ordered to search pedestrians. They had heard about the incident on Edward Road, so the inspection was more strict. Suddenly, they saw the car flying towards them, and immediately stopped it and ordered it to stop. The driver was suffering and could not ask for help. When he heard this order, he immediately stopped and jumped out of the car. However, the thugs behind the seat had already figured it out. Seeing the detectives coming from behind, they drew their guns again, and fired three shots at the detectives through the rear seat glass window. Fortunately, they were not hit. Then the detectives fought back, and the battle started again.</p>
<p>Abandoning the Car and Fleeing; Bullets Rained Down: Seeing that the situation was critical, the thugs abandoned the car and fled in the chaos for fear of being captured alive. They still opened fire along the way to resist arrest, so the corner between Old Oriental and Qingyise became a place where bullets flew. As a result, these people threw their guns and bullets along the way, mixed in with the crowd and escaped. Therefore, after a thorough search by the two concessions, many hand grenades were found, and the injured were also injured, and they were sent to various hospitals for treatment. The detectives worked together to find clues, and the ambulances were too busy to go back and forth. Dozens of Chinese patrols who had cooperated in tracking down the fugitives and fired guns at the scene were also a sign of the seriousness of the case. Fortunately, the hand grenades did not explode.</p>
<p>Investigation of the Names of People Injured by Bullets: When the fierce battle took place near Changgeng Lane on Edward Road, in addition to the three workers of Da Wan Bao being injured, one of them died due to serious injuries.

In total, there were about 20 injured.</p>
<p>It is Reported that Two Suspects Have Been Detained: In addition to the above-mentioned people, there is also a man with serious suspicion, who claimed to be Tan Ruxin. During the fierce battle, he was running and was hit in the left waist by a bullet, so he fell into the store hall of Yuhuxuan Pharmacy at No. 242 Guangxi Road, Hankou Road. The 1534th Chinese patrol who chased after him immediately asked him about his age, origin, occupation, and current address, but he only claimed that he used to be a coppersmith, but lost his job early, and the rest was ambiguous, so he was considered suspicious and has been sent to the Patrol Hospital for treatment and started investigation. In addition, another suspect was arrested and is currently detained in the Old Gate Patrol House, and is being carefully examined.</p>
<p>Hand Grenades Found in Various Places: As for the results of the search after the event, a hand grenade was found on the west side of the gate of The Times on Edward Road, a hand grenade was found on the sidewalk in front of the Old Oriental Hotel on Hankou Road, a hand grenade was found in front of Zhang Xiaoquan Knife Shop opposite No. 659 Hankou Road, and four rows of bullets were found in front of Qingyise Restaurant on Guangxi Road and Hankou Road (seven bullets are missing). At the same time, a hand grenade was also found at the intersection of Zhubaosan Road in the French Concession. At the entrance of the Mintai Sofa Shop at No. 26 Zhilan Street, box guns, hand guns, and hand grenades were found, which seemed to have been abandoned at that time. They are now stored in the patrol houses of the two concessions and are being inspected. The bullets obtained are all newly produced.</p>
<p>Cars Found in Huishi Territory: In addition, a car with invoice number 2834 was parked at the entrance of Changgeng Lane on Edward Road at the time. Because it was at the focal point of the three-party battle, it was pierced with three holes, and the rear left tire was also destroyed. In addition to the three shots fired by the escaped criminals through the rear seat glass window of car No. 12235, which pierced the glass with three holes, the front left tire of the car was hit by detectives, and the axle box was also hit by a shot. The car is still under investigation in the patrol house. The No. 12293 car drove back to the Yunfei Branch on Yidingpan Road after the incident. The other two cars, No. 12301 and No. 12301, were found in the territory of the Huishi Patrol House in Hongkou at around 10:30 PM, and they are also being inspected by the patrol house.</p>
<p>Throwing Bombs Fortunately Did Not Explode: When the crowd of thugs ran out of Changgeng Lane, in order to prevent anyone from ambushing in the alley, they opened fire indiscriminately to demonstrate and threw bombs. At that time, a huge bomb fell on the door of the Frisco Cafe bar at Nos. 35-37 Edward Road, opposite the French Concession, but fortunately it did not explode. A bullet hit the wall above the neon light in the bar, and a hole was formed in the terrazzo floor.</p>
<p>An American Standing Still Suspected of Being a Western Detective: When the crowd of thugs ran out of Changgeng Lane, Wilson (48 years old), the owner of the New Ritz Bar, which was opened at No. 31 Edward Road (that is, the intersection of Zhubaosan Road) in the French Concession, opposite, happened to be standing idly by the 15th telephone pole at the entrance of Changgeng Lane, east of the Tonghui Trust Company. The thugs saw Wilson and suspected that he was a police officer of the Patrol House, 何该处者.</p>
<p>Indiscriminate Gunfire and Death: The thugs fired indiscriminately at Wilson. Wilson was unable to dodge and was hit by four shots in the chest and abdomen. He immediately fell beside the telephone pole, blood gushing out. When the staff in the opposite store heard the news and rushed over, they immediately sent him to Guangci Hospital on Jin Shenfu Road by car. Because the injuries were all vital, he died shortly after arriving at the hospital.</p>

<h3>Nanjing Puppet Regime Opposes Britain: Even Involves Marriage Issues; Those Who Advocate Chinese Women Marrying British Men Should Divorce Their Husbands Immediately</h3>
<p>The Continental News reported that, according to Japanese sources received yesterday (the 21st), the anti-British movement of the Nanjing puppet regime has extended to marriage. A special meeting was held last week, at which it was declared that Chinese women who are married to British men should divorce immediately. The puppet regime also warned that any Chinese women who do not obey this order will be called "traitors." At the same time, the Japanese ordered Chinese people employed by British commercial houses, residences, or other institutions to resign.</p>
<h3>Restrictions on the Wearing of Military Uniforms by Women in the Interior</h3>
<p>Since women participated in the War of Resistance, the wearing of military uniforms by women in the interior has become a fad. As the trend spread, even ordinary non-military women began to imitate it. It is learned that the military authorities believe that the participation of women in military service should be promoted, but non-military women wearing military uniforms without authorization are suspected of being ostentatious. Moreover, because they do not understand military etiquette and are not familiar with military movements, it is also unsightly. Restrictions have been imposed. All non-military women are not allowed to wear military uniforms.</p>
<h3>The Result of Drastic Foreign Exchange Fluctuations: Another Round of Price Increases Across Various Industries; The Absence of Relationship Between These Industries and Foreign Exchange Provides a Good Opportunity to Promote Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>Commodity prices in this city are rising increasingly due to the recent sharp tightening of foreign exchange. Many import-related industries have raised prices again due to exchange rate fluctuations, further threatening the livelihood of citizens. Details of the situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Price Increases Across Various Industries: According to reporter investigations, industries that have recently announced continued price increases include foundries, glass beveling and decorating, auto parts, and taxi services. All have continued to raise prices. (1) Xiang Sheng, Yun Fei, Tailai, Yinse, and other taxi companies have decided to increase fares starting from the 25th of this month, with a minimum fare of $1.80 for every 20 minutes and $5.40 per hour. (2) The Continental Silk Fabric Factory has increased prices by 50% compared to the original price. (3) The machine-made coal briquette industry previously stipulated that the price of each dan (a unit of weight) of coal briquettes should not exceed $2.20. Due to increased costs of coal source, it is rumored that new price limits will be re-established, but the guild is still making efforts to regulate. (4) Mobil Oil gasoline, delivered from the bund, costs $2 per U.S. gallon, $24.50 for a pair of 5-gallon cans, and $26 per box of two 5-gallon cans. Asiatic Petroleum Company's Shell gasoline, delivered from the bund, costs $1 per gallon, and $12.25 per 5-gallon can. (5) Jinglun Factory has revised the new price for Rooster brand towels. (6) Gongda Glass Factory has increased the price of all goods by another 20%. (7) Zhonghe Auto Parts Manufacturing Factory has uniformly increased the price by 25% based on the price set on June 12. (8) The Hardware Trade Association publicly discussed market prices yesterday. In general, prices of all goods have increased by 40% to 50%. In particular, the prices of pipes and steel have increased even more. It is reported that price lists for various goods have been printed and distributed to member stores for compliance.</p>
<p>Various Industries Requiring Cash Payments: Due to foreign exchange fluctuations and increased raw material costs, industries such as coal and timber are implementing cash-only transactions starting yesterday in order to ensure cost recovery. (1) The Coal Trade Association issued an urgent notice stating that due to repeated sharp contractions in foreign exchange, the cost of various imported goods has soared. All transactions between industry players must be conducted in cash. Manufacturers and users who patronize them must pay cash before delivery. (2) The Timber Trade Association issued a notice stating that due to the current extraordinary times, foreign exchange fluctuations, and the increasing cost of imported goods, the industry has decided to implement cash-only transactions for all goods starting from the 22nd of this month, with payments and receipts limited to legal tender (fapi). Customers are requested to understand. As all industries, regardless of retail or wholesale transactions, require cash payments, the supply of legal tender in the market has become even tighter.</p>
<p>Significant Impact on Foreign Goods Industry: Due to the sharp contraction of foreign exchange, general imported goods are no longer affordable for ordinary citizens. The business of foreign merchants in Shanghai has declined sharply, and foreign goods dealers have also been hit hard. Reporters interviewed several well-known fashion stores and learned that business is significantly worse than before. The price of European and American wool and serge has risen to more than double the post-war level, and customers for new clothing have decreased significantly. The sales of foreign goods departments in major companies have also decreased significantly. Furthermore, the dealers who have historically transported foreign goods to the inland areas have been hit even harder, bordering on a standstill. According to current observations, this trend is continuing to evolve.</p>
<h3>Rice Merchants Spread Rumors of Price Increases: Disguisedly Exceeding Price Limits; Foreign Exchange Collapse Has Nothing to Do With Domestic Rice; The Rainy Season Has Passed, and Arrivals Will Definitely Be Plentiful</h3>
<p>The public concession in this city issues licenses to rice shops every six months according to regulations. Now is the time to renew licenses for the second half of the 28th year (1939). The Rice Shop Trade Association has prepared two registers, totaling 405 rice shops, 279 south of the Suzhou Creek and 126 north of the Suzhou Creek. All have prepared license fees and refugee donations, which have been forwarded by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to the Public Concession Revenue Office for license issuance.</p>
<p>The market price of domestic rice in this city has gradually stabilized after the concession authorities repeatedly set price limits. However, due to the recent tightening of exchange rates and rising prices of various imported goods, some rice merchants who only care about their own interests and disregard the overall situation are inevitably envious. They are once again taking the opportunity to</p>
<p>raise rice prices, deciding to bring all goods close to the price limit, hoarding top-quality Changshu white rice and passing off inferior goods as the real thing, still opening at the highest price limit of $20. They are also spreading rumors that the authorities will open up price limits. According to Xin Xin News Agency reporters, (1) the collapse of foreign exchange has no relationship with food rice at this time when foreign rice is not needed, and even less so with domestic rice. (2) They are using the excuse of reduced inventories to raise prices,</p>
<p>deceiving themselves and others. This phenomenon occurs every year during this transition period. This year, there are still more than 300,000 bags in storage in warehouses, and rice shops and residents also have a lot of inventory. According to estimates from all parties, there is at least enough to supply for three months. (3) Although arrivals from various sources have been reduced recently due to rain, arrivals will definitely be plentiful when the weather clears. (4) According to the price limits currently set by the authorities, rice merchants can</p>
<p>obtain profits after deducting costs and all expenses. Therefore, all sectors deeply hope that the concession authorities, during this turbulent financial period, will still adhere to their past principles, implement price limits practically while safeguarding the interests of rice merchants and stabilizing people's hearts, reject requests to release prices, send personnel to secretly investigate disguised price increases, reduce the burden on citizens, and stabilize social order.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 5,000 to 6,000 bags of rice were traded in the rice market, all of which were middle-grade rice. It was also reported that outside the market, top-grade rice was being sold privately above the price limit. In order to enforce the price limit, the concession authorities will not recognize as valid any transactions, whether wholesale or retail, where the price limit is exceeded. They also hope that the police will be reported to at any time for investigation.</p>
<h3>Money Trade Association: Committee Meeting; Discussing Internal Issues</h3>
<p>Since the United Reserve of the Money Trade Association concentrated bills of exchange according to the orders of the ministry, authorized the Reserve to take charge of business dealings to and from the Bank Bills of Exchange United Reserve, its internal and external work has become abruptly rushed and complicated. Yesterday at 2 pm, at the Ningbo Road association offices, another executive committee meeting was held. Those in attendance included general manager of the reserve Chen Zhushan, and Qin Runqing, Zhang Mengzhou, Fei Yunqing, Wang Huailian, and other ten-plus persons. Chaired by Chen Zhushan, with Ge Huaiqing taking notes, apart from the chair's report on the reserve's affairs and unfinished business after the concentration of bills of exchange, the meeting also discussed internal issues such as refusing to use banknotes with North China place names and the solidification of reserve funds for each business. It adjourned around 3 pm.</p>

<p>Securities Recover</p>
<p>Shanghai's gray market for securities suffered a disastrous drop in the prices of all unified bonds because of speculation in foreign exchange and gold. Now, because foreign exchange is loosening and gold is falling back, and furthermore, because although the Ministry of Finance declared a suspension of principal and interest payment for those maturing at the end of July, the Four Banks (Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and Farmers Bank of China) have indeed permitted discounting and borrowing against them, but Shanghai and the other ports will offset the debts in six installments. Thus, prices recovered strongly yesterday morning. At the morning close, Class A was at $52.05, up $3.05; Class B at $44, up $2.50; Class C at $43, up $2.10; no transactions for Class D; Class E at $42.85, up $2.35. However, compared to the dark trading in the gray market the afternoon before, they had actually fallen by several cents.</p>
<p>Gold Recovers</p>
<p>The gray market for gold, because of manipulators' operations, once created a new record of $4,600. After trading opened yesterday morning, it still didn't shed the chaotic situation. It initially dropped to a low of $3,000, but because Japanese banks continued to scramble for foreign exchange, the price of gold recovered. At the morning close, it was at $3,470, a drop of $95 compared to the previous day. In the afternoon, Saturday's usual suspension of trading. At the gold shops, Dahang first quoted $360, then $350; Xinhang $348. It is said that the gray market prices of gold rise and fall so rampantly entirely due to manipulators' operations, and that the operations of the money exchange firms are the worst. A certain business's sole operation is speculative gold.</p>
<p>Discount Drops</p>
<p>To speculate in foreign exchange, gold, and other transactions, one must have huge amounts of banknotes. Thus, when speculative business flourishes, the bill of exchange discount necessarily soars. Although the bill of exchange discount is forbidden by the government, the small money exchange firms know only their own interests, disregard government laws, and operate as before. Yesterday, because foreign exchange loosened and gold fell, the bill of exchange discount dropped slightly to $205. As for Tianjin market's foreign exchange, it followed Shanghai's black market and tightened. It is said that yesterday the Tianjin foreign exchange rates were: 3 1/875 pence for the pound, $6.25 for the US dollar, and $140 for Shanghai exchange--that is, for every $100 paid in Shanghai, Tianjin should receive $140.</p>
<p>Dangers of Speculation</p>
<p>A New Voice News Agency reporter made inquiries of the banking world, and learned that Shanghai's financial community is exhausting itself to cope with the environment. Abiding by government orders, they are striving tirelessly. But speculators disregard the government's wartime financial policies, know only how to make a profit, and are manipulating again and again, creating today's abnormal situation in Shanghai. It is truly not easy for the current government to devise methods to maintain Shanghai's financial market within possible bounds. But because Shanghai, which is a fallen area, is outside the government's power, it is difficult to crack down on speculation. It is hoped that speculators will take a stand on the nation's position and awaken on their own.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Maintained</p>
<p>Regarding market rumors that the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund Committee would maintain the black market foreign exchange, the New Voice News Agency reporter made inquiries of the banking world yesterday, and learned that the Shanghai Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee has always maintained the black market, but to prevent arbitrage, it must be strictly limited, or else the situation might resemble Tianjin's, with the pound contracting to within four pennies. There are also rumors that the Ministry of Finance has new instructions for maintaining Shanghai's finances, but the reporter, inquiring of the Central Bank of China, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, and the three banks, as well as various groups, has found it difficult to confirm. As for the Central Bank of China and Bank of Communications redeeming banknotes with place names from Tianjin, they are continuing to redeem, and have not yet received instructions from head office about how to proceed.</p>
<p>Transactions Cash</p>
<p>Since Shanghai's black market foreign exchange tightened, the costs of imported goods have suddenly risen, and prices have uniformly soared. Because of high exchange rate discounts, transactions are using cash. (1) Mobil Asiatic gasoline announced that it would revise new prices starting today, with each American gallon costing $2 from the pump. (2) The Coal Industry Association announced that transactions among members of the same trade must be in cash. (3) The Timber Industry Association announced that starting yesterday, all goods must be in cash transactions. (4) The Foundry Industry Association announced another price increase. (5) The Glass Beveling and Flower Industry Association announced revised prices.</p>
<h3>Two New Hurricanes; One Will Strike Tokyo; The First Hurricane Has Dissipated and Wandered; The Local Temperature Exceeded Ninety Degrees Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hurricanes in the Pacific are rising one after another. Two newly-risen hurricanes, one of which has transformed into a cyclone, one of which is trending towards Japan. The Great Allied Press Agency reports as follows:</p>

<p>The Second Hurricane Changes Direction Abruptly</p>
<p>The Xujiahui Observatory reported that the second Pacific hurricane reached 23 degrees north latitude and 132 degrees east longitude at 6 am yesterday morning. The direction turned due north. Subsequently, the Observatory reported at 2 pm that the hurricane had reached 25 degrees north latitude and 133 degrees east longitude, and the direction turned to north-northeast.</p>
<p>Trending Toward Tokyo; Shanghai Can Avoid Strike</p>
<p>According to the direction of the second Pacific hurricane as reported yesterday afternoon, although the distance is still far, it is heading directly for Tokyo, Japan. At the same time, when the previous hurricane struck this city, the air pressure in Japan was quite high, but it has suddenly dropped in recent days, comparable to the climate in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, so a strike is highly possible. The coastal areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang can avoid it.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Temperature Exceeded Ninety Degrees</p>
<p>Since the hurricane swept across Shanghai on the west side on the 20th, the weather turned clear from the day before yesterday, but the temperature was quite low. Compared to yesterday, the temperature rose again. According to Observatory records, the highest temperature before 3 pm yesterday was 90.5 degrees, and the lowest temperature was 73.4 degrees, which was hotter than the previous few days. Also, the high tide of the Huangpu River can gradually return to normal starting today.</p>
<h3>New Clearing System; Circulating in the Market; Reviewing Collateral at Any Time; Inspection Committee to Convene Soon</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai Bank United Reserve Committee began handling interbank clearing matters on July 4, banks and firms have successively provided collateral and applied to the Committee to use interbank clearing. The three valuation committees of the Committee on real estate, securities, stocks, and goods have been evaluated by the chairman of the committee, Qian Xinzhi, Bei Songsun, and Tang Shoumin. Designated representatives were opened separately</p>

<p>Clearing Balance</p>
<p>After the Central Central Communications and three banks allowed it to be converted into legal currency in twelve weeks from July 4 to facilitate turnover, each week's 1.8 million yuan has already been converted into 5.5 million yuan, so the market has increased the number of legal currency chips,</p>
<p>One Yuan Fund Movement</p>
<p>The Municipal Refugee Vocational Training Institute has been established for nearly two years. It has successively established woodworking, toy, embroidery, laundry, towel dyeing, paper box weaving, soap sewing and other workshops. In order to enable the remaining refugees to learn other skills and dedicate themselves to society in the future, it has decided to add glove printing and sock weaving workshops in succession. Due to lack of funds, it is impossible to organize. Therefore, the board of directors decided to organize a One Yuan Fund Movement Committee to request donations from all sectors to enable the refugee production business to be permanently maintained. Those who donate more than five yuan will be given a thank you letter, and those who donate more than one yuan will be given a thank you badge. Fundraising has now begun.</p>
<h3>Using Holiday Business Factories to Recruit Workers; Threatening and Inducing Chinese Workers to Fill Military Service; Transferred to Fake "Manchukuo" After Three Months; Chinese Workers Perceive Conspiracy and Are Unwilling to Be Entrapped</h3>
<p>Da Guang News Agency said that the Japanese side has invaded China for two years, in these two years, after the country's implementation of a long-term resistance policy, in addition to the Japanese side's wartime finance is on the verge of bankruptcy, and its invasion of China's military quota, also suffered heavy casualties, resulting in the domestic standing army has been greatly reduced. At present, most of the Japanese troops who have been decided to be transferred to China are supplemented by strong conscription of young men, and recently the conflict between the fake "Manchukuo" and Outer Mongolia is becoming increasingly serious, then the Japanese side is feeling increasingly overwhelmed</p>
<p>Unable to Cope</p>
<p>Therefore, the Japanese side relies on its special forces in the mainland to pull away our young men and coolies, and give them training, to fill the fake army, to bear the shortage of rear soldiers. In Shanghai, the Japanese side recruits workers in the name of Japanese business factories in Hongkou, and with each person getting 1.5 yuan per day</p>
<p>Reward Induction</p>
<p>A temporary reception station is set up on the other side of the Baidu Bridge, and trucks are parked in front of the reception station. Whenever the quota is full, they are driven into Hongkou. It has been two days. Because a group of Chinese workers, although poor and without a place to stand, know the Japanese conspiracy, they are unwilling to be entrapped. But those who are deceived and blinded have reached more than 200 people. According to a reporter from Da Guang News Agency, the Japanese side has induced in Shanghai and the mainland</p>
<p>Young Chinese People</p>
<p>Once left to Hongkou, they will lose their freedom. Under Japanese pressure, they are forcibly transported to Qingdao to engage in three months of military service training. The strong and strong are selected and transferred to the fake "Manchukuo" outside the customs to serve, and the rest are distributed to various places to be driven by the Japanese puppet regime, with no hope of returning alive.</p>
<p>New Fourth Army Painfully Suppresses; Robbery of Stockade Bandits in Zhuzhai Town</p>
<p>Zhuzhai Town, west of the city, was robbed by armed stockade bandits the night before last. It is learned that on the night the town was robbed, the New Fourth Army happened to arrive at a certain key pass several miles away from the town. Before the troops had unloaded their luggage, they heard the alarm and joined the Xu department of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army to send a team to track and suppress the bandits. They encountered them in a certain village northwest of the Hongqiao Airport and immediately surrounded the bandits, exerting pressure. The bandits stubbornly resisted. The two sides fought, and the bullets were as dense as a string of pearls. The battle in the dark night lasted until dawn, and the bandits were defeated. More than 40 bandits were killed by the New Fourth Army and Xu department, and five were captured alive. More than 50 rifles and pistol were seized, and many stolen goods, clothing, and cloth were seized. However, more than ten soldiers were also killed in action. Five bandits were captured alive and interrogated strictly. Two of them were originally local civilians who were coerced and implicated. After verification, they were ordered to be released on bail. The other three bandits confessed to robbery and were immediately beheaded and executed, clarifying the law.</p>
<h3>Deng Benyin Leads Troops; Counter-Attacking Suxi; Heavy Japanese Casualties in the Battle of Hushu Pass</h3>
<p>Former Qiongya Garrison Commander, now Commander-in-Chief of the Jiangnan Guerrilla Army, Deng Benyin, after receiving a new appointment from the Central Government, personally went to the Beijing-Shanghai Line to command the various armies, and led the Mei and Zhu departments to first eliminate bandits and bandits in the various rural areas to ensure the livelihood of the people, and at the same time attacked Japanese puppet troops along the line such as Hushu Pass, Dongqiao, and Huangdai, annihilating many, and obtaining small steel cannons, light and heavy machine guns, rifles, and other spoils of war. According to people from Wuxi, Deng's guerrilla forces commanding operations along the Beijing-Shanghai Line number more than 30,000 people. In the battle of Hushu Pass this month, the number of Japanese puppet troops killed and wounded reached more than 140 people, and the Chinese army also sacrificed quite a bit. The troops are now preparing to counter-attack the three counties of Wuxi, Suzhou, and Kunshan. It is heard that the Japanese puppet troops stationed there are quite worried.</p>
<h3>Fresh Pork Industry to Suspend Operations; Sources of Pigs All Monopolized</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese puppet "Livestock Market" illegally monopolized the source of fresh pigs, the city's fresh pig shops, butcher shops, stalls, etc., once had fake scales and fake markets. After the two concession authorities tried their best to persuade them, the shops reluctantly resumed operations. On the one hand, they sent personnel to the Bureau of Works and the Public Board to petition. As a result, the authorities separately submitted requests to the French Consulate in Shanghai and the consulates of various countries in Shanghai for discussion before replying. However, this case has been going on for more than two months and has not been resolved. The Japanese puppet "Livestock Market"'s control plan will be implemented definitively, and the source of fresh pigs can be said to be completely monopolized. Pig traders are also unwilling to transport them. Therefore, all fresh pig merchants in the city cannot trade due to various reasons and will suspend operations to wait for the proper resolution of the concession authorities.</p>
<h3>Female Foreman (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ding Wenqin</p>
<p>On Jaxi Road in the French Concession, there is a Chinese needle factory (commonly known as the thread-drawing factory). In the factory, there is a female foreman, which is me. Whenever I leave the factory after work, people from neighboring factories often say with great concern: "This is the head," "This is the 'number one man'." I don't have time to listen to their arguments, and I don't have any opinions. Whichever name sounds better. In short, I feel that I am slowly becoming like them, and I am very happy.</p>
<p>"No matter what the size of the matter, as long as you do your best, there is nothing you can't do well." This is what a teacher taught me. I developed faith in these words, and they generated strength and increased my courage. So I stepped into the sacred ranks of workers. Many relatives and friends' praise, ridicule, and regret went in my left ear, but I immediately let them out of my right ear. I myself would rather take off my gauze cheongsam, discard my high heels, and wear a blue cloth robe, a pair of cloth shoes, an apron, and sincerely work, eat, and chat with them. I feel happy in my spirit. What else do I need to care about?</p>
<p>This common and unappreciated needle - I don't know how much money has flowed overseas for it. From a steel wire being forged into a usable needle, it goes through more than ten procedures, and each step is so troublesome. Simply put, it is twisting, grinding the tip, grinding the middle, pressing the eye, piercing the hole, cutting the eye, tempering, small grinding, large grinding, grinding the small tip, aligning the needles, and finally polishing - until it is bright. At this point, a bright and smooth needle is complete. After that, packaging and so on are the business of female workers. Dozens of female workers are divided into several groups, and each group has one person who is responsible for distributing the needles. She arranges the needle wrapping paper one by one, then pads it with tin foil, and then takes two copper plates and inserts them diagonally into the needles that have already been placed in the paper bucket (one side of the copper plate is engraved with many grooves). Then she gently lifts it up, and the needles lie obediently in the copper plate grooves. She distributes them in packs like this. The rest of the people move their nimble and quick fingers, and packs of rectangular needles come out of their hands. After the sizes are matched, they have to be packed into large barrels and boxes. The current trademarks are China, Double Happiness, Standard, and Buddha Hand. Needle sizes range from number one to number twelve, and there are also out-of-number needles (that is, larger than number one), such as 2/0, 3/0, and 5/0. We work ten hours a day, from 7 am to 6 pm, with one hour of free time at noon. Fast workers can pack three or four thousand packs a day, and even the slowest can exceed two thousand packs. In addition to paying the prescribed wages, the factory also gives bonuses according to the speed of needle packing, so as long as you work diligently, you can earn three or four yuan a month in bonuses, which is not a big deal at all.</p>
<p>Although we work all day, our spirits are happy, because the people in the factory are integrated with the workers and there is absolutely no class distinction. From the factory director and manager to the tea boy and cook, everyone eats steamed buns and drinks sorghum tea. Smart friends may have noticed another thing. Yes, the colleagues in our factory, in addition to the female workers recruited in Shanghai, are all from Shandong. Therefore, many classmates know this and write to ask me: "A×, is your Mandarin becoming Shandongized!" Not only am I not worried about this, but I am also very willing to learn. I think that if Shandong dialect is spoken softly and clearly, it is also very pleasant to hear. The reason why their pronunciation is different from Mandarin seems to be because there are more level-tone characters, for example, "Kunming is Mr. Fang's hometown." All nine of these characters are pronounced as level tones except for "is" and "of", so although it is not correct, it is probably not far from Shandong dialect, I think.</p>
<p>Although there is no chaos or noise in the female worker's workshop, it is not absolutely serious. I always feel that occasionally laughing or talking slightly will reduce the fatigue of work. One morning, just after the bell rang, everyone was starting to work when A Yu rushed into the workshop, panting and saying: "Mr. ×, because I was waiting for the toilet cart, I didn't know he was so late today, I poured two toilets, that's why I was late." How frank! How sincere! These unadorned words can only be heard from their mouths. Unexpectedly, before she finished speaking, a crow-like laughter broke the silence, and it turned out that A Niu, who was called a fool by her companions, had fallen down laughing. She immediately realized that she was wrong and quickly stopped. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>"Hua Xing" Banknotes - Ordered to be Prohibited from Exchange - A Small Number Sneaking In Easily Leads to Abuses</h3>
<p>The money exchange and silver exchange businesses in this city recently received a telegram order from the Ministry of Finance stating that "Hua Xing" banknotes were disrupting the financial market and hindering the market situation. An earlier order had already been issued to prohibit their acceptance and use. However, there were concerns that a small number might sneak in easily, leading to abuses. Therefore, another telegram order was issued to the relevant businesses, strictly instructing them to refuse acceptance and exchange in order to maintain the financial market and emphasize monetary policy.</p>
<h3>Dinghai Shenjiamen - The Situation is Bleak - Forced to Open Shops - Salt and Fishery Taxes Imposed</h3>
<p>Since Dinghai was lost, the Japanese side, although colluding with local ruffians to organize a so-called "Maintenance Association" to encourage residents to return, threatened shops with confiscation. As a result, only five or six out of ten shops have opened. The elderly and young children have also returned to the city, but strong young men and women all regard the urban area as a dangerous place and refrain from entering. Japanese troops in Dinghai have set up heavy artillery and machine gun teams in all four city gates. Entering and leaving the city is subject to strict searches. The city gates are closed tightly before sunset, creating a panicked atmosphere. Japanese military scrip is quite prevalent in the market. Salt and fishery taxes have both been imposed. The situation in Shenjiamen is also very bleak, with the fishing industry already under control.</p>
<h3>Ms. Zhang Fang - Celebratory Banquet Upon Returning Home After Completing Studies</h3>
<p>Ms. Zhang Fang from Ningbo, after graduating from St. Mary's University in the United States, recently returned to China.

The entire assembly applauded. Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Yu Zuoting, He Dekui, Pan Yangyao, and Yan Duhe successively delivered speeches, offering abundant encouragement. After the ceremony, a photograph was taken to commemorate the occasion. Mr. Bao concluded with a thank-you speech, and the gathering dispersed.</p>

<h3>Opium Merchant's Inheritance Leads to Murder Case - Defendant Released on Bail Pending Judgment - The Deceased's Mother and Wife Among Those Summoned for Questioning</h3>
<p>The late Fan Jiwu, a Chaozhou native who owned the Jiwu opium den, accumulated assets of several hundred thousand during his lifetime. He had one wife and two concubines. His wife, Gao, adopted six sons, namely Fan Siyu, Siyuan, Simao, Sili, Sihong, and Sizhang. His concubine, Yao, gave birth to Sihai, who was the seventh son and is now deceased, and also adopted one son whose name is unknown. His second concubine, Shen, also adopted one son named Sibin. Fan's wife and concubines are all still alive and live with the sons at No. 23 Yufu Lane, Nanyang Bridge. Fan passed away ten years ago.</p>
<p>All property rights</p>
<p>are entirely managed by his wife, Gao, who has a will stating that the assets can only be divided into eleven shares after twenty years. On the 3rd of this month, Fan's fourth son, Sili, fifth son, Sihong, and sixth son, Sizhang, demanded that their mother, Gao, divide the property, but Gao refused and left in anger, not returning for two days and nights. At 7:30 PM on the 6th, Sili, Sihong, and Sizhang again demanded their mother from their eldest brother, Siyu, leading to a dispute. Siyu, who had been suffering from lung disease for over ten years, coughed up blood instantly after being pushed violently by Sili, and died before receiving medical attention.</p>
<p>Died That Night</p>
<p>The deceased's wife reported to the French Concession police station, and the body had already been prepared for burial. Subsequently, the coffin was taken to the autopsy site, and the Second Special Court was requested to send personnel to open the coffin for examination. The results of the autopsy determined that the deceased died from coughing up blood caused by the impact. The police station detained Sili, Sihong, and Sizhang and sent them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. The defendants hired lawyer Wang Liwu to request bail, but it was denied. Details have already been recorded in the newspaper. Now, the police department has summoned the deceased's</p>
<p>mother Fan Gao</p>
<p>the deceased's wife Fan Guo, witness Fan A Ming, and brought the defendants for the conclusion of the investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Liao from the Second Special Court continued the trial in the criminal court. The defendants hired lawyer Jiang Yiping for defense. First, lawyer Gu Shouxi from the French Concession administrative authority presented the case, filing a public prosecution on the charge of causing death by negligence. Then, detective Zhong Benchang reported on the investigation process. According to Fan Gao, her husband ran an</p>
<p>opium business</p>
<p>and died ten years ago. There is a will stating that the family will be divided after twenty years. On the 3rd of this month, her fourth, fifth, and sixth sons asked her to divide the family, but she refused and left in anger. She did not know how they argued with the eldest son later. She only returned home after seeing the newspaper report that the eldest son had died. The deceased's wife, Fan Guo, stated that her husband was pushed by the defendants and died. When questioned, the defendants all claimed that they asked their eldest brother about their mother's whereabouts at 11 AM and spoke politely. They were not at home in the evening. Their mother usually</p>
<p>protected the eldest brother</p>
<p>and they all opposed him. At this point, the court considered the case clear, ordered the debate to begin, and announced the conclusion, scheduling the verdict for the 27th. The three defendants were each released on bail with a surety to appear when summoned. Fan Sihong was required to provide an additional written guarantee of 200 yuan for verification.</p>
<h3>A Morphine Production Den Busted in Xiangyun Lane, Route Lafayette - Refining Morphine Extract to Falsely Represent Supplements and Sell in Mixed Sales - The Mastermind Escaped Upon Hearing the News, One Accomplice Arrested</h3>
<p>A certain A, a well-known drug trafficking kingpin, was secretly refining the narcotic drug morphine extract inside a rented house at No. 3 Xiangyun Lane, Route Lafayette in the French Concession, packing it into small glass tubes, falsely representing it as an injectable supplement produced in Japan, and selling it mixed in the market for huge profits. Recently, the French Concession police learned of this and dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives at 7 AM the day before yesterday to search the premises. The owner had already escaped upon hearing the news. Two large glass bottles of liquid morphine extract and many Japanese-language instruction manuals were seized in the front room of the three-story building. Only an accomplice, Yu Piji (33 years old), was arrested and taken back to the police station. Yesterday afternoon, he was sent to Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special Court. Lawyer Gu Shouxi from the French Concession administrative authority explained the case, requesting a postponement to apprehend the escaped mastermind and investigate before filing a lawsuit for trial. Then, the detectives reported on the situation of the bust. When questioned, Yu Piji claimed that the items were left in his care by a friend, who said they were life-saving medicines and that he did not know they were morphine. Judge Liao examined the confession and ordered the defendant to be detained for further investigation and interrogation on the 27th.</p>
<h3>Bookbinders Stage a Strike - Demand Restoration of Pre-War Wages</h3>
<p>The binding of books for various bookstores in this city is contracted out to various bookbinding workshops. There are currently over fifty such workshops, employing over a thousand workers in total. The larger ones include Jinyi on Chengdu Road, Puxieji on Xinzha Road, Gukunji on Route Foch, Fuxing on Datong Road, Zhujinji on Wuding Road, Shenquanji on Haining Road, and Chunshenji on Dazha Road. Recently, due to poor business, the wages of ordinary workers have been reduced to one-third of their original level. Recently, with the sharp contraction of foreign exchange and rising prices, the monthly income of these workers is barely enough to feed themselves, and their families are facing great difficulties. Therefore, they have been actively demanding that the workshop owners restore pre-war wages to maintain their livelihoods. However, the workshop owners have no concrete solutions. The workers of various workshops, forced by circumstances, have been individually and voluntarily staging a strike since yesterday, while appealing to all sectors for assistance. It is said that the bookstores are directly affected by the strike of these bookbinding workers, as a large number of regular publications and books will not be published on time. Therefore, the bookstores are paying close attention. However, it is heard that after the workers' strike, most of the workshop owners are considering the situation and feel that the workers' demands are indeed justified, so it is expected that this situation will not escalate.</p>
<h3>Imitation of Needle-Making Machines - Infringement of Rights - Two Defendants Released on Bail Pending Review</h3>
<p>Yin Zhizhong, a 38-year-old man from Dengzhou, Shandong, residing at No. 220 Route Jashiyi in the French Concession, previously invented and manufactured a needle-making machine, applied to the Ministry of Industry for patent registration, and established a factory for manufacturing and distribution. Subsequently, the China Needle Factory was found to be imitating and counterfeiting his product. He reported this to the police station, who detained Li Beihai and Ma Benlong from the factory and brought them to the Second Special Court for interrogation. Li Beihai was sentenced to six months in prison, and three machines were confiscated. It has now been discovered that Ma Benlong and Shen Ganting are again imitating the same machine at the Tiangong Foreign Needle Factory at No. 80 Route Conty and selling it mixed in the market, infringing on patent rights. Therefore, lawyer Chao Jimei was commissioned to report to the French Concession police, who detained Ma and Shen and seized the imitated machines. Yesterday, they were brought to Criminal Division 8 of the Second Special Court. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi from the French Concession administrative authority filed a lawsuit according to law and explained the case. The defendants hired lawyer Xu Wufang for defense. After the court questioned the plaintiff and the two defendants in detail, it ordered the defendants to be released on bail pending further investigation and interrogation at a later date.</p>
<h3>Old Clerk Escorting Funds - Encountered Robbery on the Way - Three Robbers Apprehended for Investigation</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 1:30 PM, the Yitai Yarn Store at No. 54 Zunde Lane, Xiamen Road, ordered its old clerk, Song Shirong, to take 1,652.50 yuan in legal tender to the Baoxingxiang Yarn Store on Wuhu Road to purchase yarn flowers. While Song was walking at the intersection of Beijing Road and Guizhou Road, three robbers suddenly came forward and robbed the legal tender that Song was carrying. Song resisted, causing the legal tender to scatter all over the ground. Song immediately shouted for the police, and Chinese constables stationed nearby and detective Xu Fusheng from the Chinese Detective Team heard the alarm and rushed to arrest the robbers. At that time, one robber, Yang Wulang from Chongming, was arrested, and 200 yuan of the original stolen money was seized. Song Shirong also picked up 1,127.50 yuan in legal tender from the ground. Therefore, Yitai's actual loss was only 325 yuan. The detectives brought the arrested robber to the Lao Zha Police Station. Yang confessed that his two accomplices who escaped were named Xiao Shen and Wu Mugou, and that the robbery was initiated by Xiao Shen. Yesterday morning, they were sent to Criminal Division 1 of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Ru BaoYi explained the situation and requested permission to postpone the trial in order to investigate and apprehend the escaped accomplices. When questioned, Yang Wulang confessed to the robbery with Xiao Shen and Wu Mugou. After questioning by Judge Feng Shide, Yang was ordered to be detained and the trial was postponed.</p>
<h3>Sexually Assaulting a Girl - Appeal Leads to Acquittal</h3>
<p>Zheng Huang, a Cantonese woman residing at No. 54 Route Loyd, discovered abnormalities in the private parts of her twelve-year-old niece, Lu Achang, in April of this year. When questioned strictly, the girl said that she had been sexually assaulted by Zhang Shicai, a Chongming native who lived in the same house. The woman reported this to the Lao Zha Police Station, who dispatched detectives to arrest Zhang and sent him and the girl to the hospital. It was found that Zhang had gonorrhea, and the girl also had a new case of gonorrhea, which was considered to have been transmitted by Zhang. Therefore, the First Special District Court sentenced Zhang Shicai to six years of imprisonment in the first trial. However, after being detained, Zhang was unwilling to accept the sentence and hired lawyers Fan Gang and Xu Siliang to file an appeal with the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Judge Yu opened a collegial panel to repeatedly interrogate the victim, Lu Achang, and brought Zhang Shicai to court. In addition to denying the charges, Zhang's defense lawyers, Fan and Yu, argued that the girl's hymen was not broken, proving that Zhang had not committed the crime, and requested an acquittal. Yesterday afternoon, the case was pronounced, and Zhang Shicai was found not guilty.</p>

<h3>The Evolution of and Opinions on Chinese University Curricula (Continued) - The Ministry of Education Began Reorganizing Curricula in 1931 - Draft of Required and Elective Courses for Each Department</h3>
<p>In 1931, the Ministry of Education began to reorganize curricula. The following year, it collected a list of curricula from famous universities abroad and collected the curriculum descriptions of national, provincial, and registered private universities. Experts were separately hired to draft various curriculum drafts according to the curricula of universities at home and abroad, dividing them by colleges and departments. In November 1932, former Minister Zhu published "Explanation of the Ministry of Education's Reorganization of National Education in the Past Nine Months," in which he discussed the improvements that should be made to university curricula, saying, "Today's university curricula are broad, complex, and chaotic, lacking a system. This is an undeniable fact. The establishment of curricula should consider the system of the curriculum itself and objective conditions. Today's universities seem to have been silent on this and have not considered it. Universities are places for academic research, and the subjects they research must be studied systematically from basic to specialized. If the importance is reversed and the order is lost, placing importance on specialization over basic, and specialization before basic, then students will have already confused their path, and how can academic research be successful? The research of specialized academics, in terms of system, is endless. It cannot be accomplished in the four years of university teaching. Students must continue to conduct in-depth research after graduation in order to be successful. Today's universities must respect the system of departments when setting up courses, emphasizing the importance and order, so that students are accustomed to independent research. Students can continue their studies after graduation, and there is no need to worry that their specialization will be exhaustive. There is no need to set up courses on various specialized problems, being greedy for too much and aiming too high, which obscures the importance of basic courses. In addition, there are objective conditions that must be considered when setting up courses, namely equipment. Courses cannot be set up lightly. The more specialized the course, the more extensive the equipment. If there is not sufficient equipment, then setting up specialized courses is arbitrary. At present, universities often avoid the important and take the easy when setting up specialized courses, choosing various specialized problem courses that can be set up with relatively simple equipment, such as the proliferation of literature courses. Due to this special situation, the Ministry intends to establish standards for the courses of various departments in universities and to limit them. Currently, university courses are divided into four categories: preparatory courses, major courses, specialized courses, and supplementary courses. The Ministry intends to combine preparatory courses and major courses into one category, called basic courses, and their weight should be particularly increased. Courses that are not very important and are nearly repetitive should be deleted. As for various specialized problems, they are supplements to learning basic courses and should be left for students to study and refer to on their own. It is also not necessary to set them up. The specialized courses of all colleges in a university should also be planned as a whole and set up in a unified manner to avoid duplication, so that they can be selected as required and elective courses for each other, so as to save expenses and provide reasonable resources. Students' research can also be made to communicate with each other, avoiding the narrowness of being limited to departmental distinctions." From the above report, we can see the Ministry of Education's determination to reorganize university curricula. Former Minister Wang also continued to hire experts to draft the required and elective courses for each department, and compiled a comparative table of the courses of each department in national universities, which was used as a reference when drafting the curricula.</p>

The pharmaceutical aspects have been contracted out by the association to various national drug stores and pharmacies with special discounts, and free medicine vouchers are given to the poor and sick to lighten the burden on parents. Xiao Tuian, an executive member of the National Medical Association, has been appointed as the director of medical affairs, and over a dozen enthusiastic doctors, including Cai Luxian, Sun Jianan, Qu Shichang, Chen Shuxiu, Wu Quji, Xiao Youan, Yu Hanhe, and Wang Donglin, have been appointed as Chinese and Western volunteer doctors.

<h3>Charity Ping-Pong Unexpected Result: Qingyun Defeats Jingwu by a Score of 5 to 2, Crowd Exceeds Thousands in Unprecedented Spectacle</h3>
<p>The charity ping-pong match organized by the Jingwu Athletic Association was held at the Sino-Youth Hall last night at 8 p.m. There were more than a thousand philanthropists who love to do good deeds, filling the basketball hall to capacity. Xi Yushu delivered an opening speech. In the end, Qingyun unexpectedly defeated Jingwu by a score of 5 to 2. It was most regrettable that Zhang Liansheng of Jingwu lost to Lang Depei in the second set, and Zhang Ying lost to Xie Shouhua in the fourth set. Since Qingyun took the lead with a score of 3 to 1, Lu Hanjun's victory made it 4 to 1. With the overall victory secured, the last two sets were hastily concluded. It was faintly heard that Jingwu expressed dissatisfaction and intended to make a decision to challenge again.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Match</p>
<p>As soon as the match started, Jingwu's Ouyang Wei met Qingyun's Zhang Zhihong. Ou was brave and good at fighting, and Zhang was also not weak. After a fierce battle of three rounds, Ou was better and won Zhang Zhihong with a score of 3 to 1. In the second set, Qingyun's Lang Depei played against Jingwu's Zhang Liansheng. Zhang took the lead and won the first game. Qingyun's Lang Depei was not willing to be outdone and immediately returned the favor. The third game was very tense, and Zhang Liansheng ultimately could not win the most crucial points and was defeated. He suffered a crushing defeat in the fourth game. In the third set, Ma Tingliang defeated Chen Zhaowen with a score of 3 to 2, displaying many brilliant moves. In the fourth set, Zhang Ying met Qingyun's Xie Shouhua, and it was a head-to-head confrontation, which was quite impressive. Unexpectedly, Zhang Ying, who could compete with Lu Hanjun for a day's glory, suffered a crushing defeat. Qingyun took the lead with a score of 3 to 1. In the fifth set, veteran Lu Zhongqiu, who had been away from the table tennis world for a long time, was naturally not Lu Hanjun's opponent. Qingyun announced victory with a score of 4 to 1. The last two sets were no longer relevant to the outcome. In the final result, Qingyun defeated Jingwu with a score of 5 to 2.</p>
<p>Qingyun</p>
<p>Jingwu</p>
<p>(1) Zhang Zhihong - Ouyang Wei 0-3</p>
<p>(2) Lang Depei - Zhang Liansheng 3-1</p>
<p>(3) Ma Tingliang - Chen Zhaowen 3-2</p>
<p>(4) Xie Shouhua - Zhang Ying 3-1</p>
<p>(5) Lu Hanjun - Zhongqiu 3-0</p>
<p>(6) Li Zongpei - Rong Dening 0-3</p>
<p>(7) Le Junchang - Guo Xiquan 3-1</p>
<p>Final Result: 5 to 2, Qingyun Wins</p>

<h3>Finance: Large Numbers of Bullish Foreign Exchange Speculators Emerge, Exchange Rates Rebound, U.S. Dollar Once Reaches $9</h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange market conditions: The HSBC listing did not change. In the black market for British and American currencies, the loosening trend before the close of the previous day continued to harden. Since it was heard that the Chinese Ministry of Finance ordered the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to maintain foreign exchange, the HSBC supply price has hovered around the 4 pence mark for the British pound. Therefore, the opening price for the British pound was 4 pence 4375, and the U.S. dollar was $8.625, which was higher than yesterday's close by .0625 and .125, respectively. After the opening, large numbers of Hua merchants and speculators bravely emerged with huge bullish positions. Moreover, foreign firms' settlements gradually decreased. In addition, foreign banks were also willing to sell at that time, especially American firms that were eager to sell. It was even rumored among the exchange houses that HSBC's listed British pound would increase by .25 and the U.S. dollar by half a dollar, causing the British pound to fall to 4 pence .75 and the U.S. dollar to exceed the $9 mark, reaching $9.25. Later, because Japanese banks and Sassoon took the opportunity to buy aggressively, Hua merchants and speculators temporarily took a wait-and-see attitude, resulting in a temporary sharp tightening. The British pound rebounded to 4 pence .375, and the U.S. dollar returned to within the $9 mark, at $8.50. At noon, the wave of aggressive buying had subsided, and the market rebounded strongly to close at noon. The British pound was calculated at 4 pence .53125, and the U.S. dollar was $8.8125. Trading was still active in the half-day. Futures were traded between banks for the August British pound at 4 pence .1875, and there were no reported transactions for July. As for the Hong Kong dollar, banks still did not sell.</p>
<p>Japanese Banks Take the Opportunity to Buy Aggressively</p>
<p>In the early morning, it was said that the recent London broads were unchanged, and the deferred contracts continued to rise by .0625. The New York silver price was stable, and the London raw gold did not change. The exchange rate of British pound against the U.S. dollar was up by three cents, and it was flat against Shanghai and France. The U.S. dollar was up by .0625 against the British pound, down by 45 cents against Shanghai, and still flat against France. The central listing prices for each currency remained the same. The banks' opening spot selling prices in the morning were 4 pence .4375 for the British pound and $8.625 for the U.S. dollar, which were higher than yesterday evening's close by .0625 for the British pound and .125 for the U.S. dollar. After the opening, because the Hua merchants' cotton yarn gangs and securities gangs and other large bullish positions poured out in large quantities, and there were few settlements from the foreign firms, coupled with the fact that foreign banks were not in a good mood and their willingness to sell was strong, the situation suddenly tightened. It was estimated that the British bank sold spot British pounds to foreign firms for 4 pence .4375, and a certain bank, Datong, also sold spot U.S. dollars to foreign firms for $8.625. Later, the Hua merchants' cotton yarn gangs and securities gangs competed to sell to foreign firms, which benefited the Tianjin gangs. The Hua merchants also traded spot British pounds from 4 pence and a half to .75, and also sold spot U.S. dollars from $8.75 to $9.25. Then a certain bank and Yyouli bought in. At that time, there was a rumor that HSBC's listing would increase, but it turned out that there were no changes. And the silver balance tax was announced, and it was still exempt from tax. After that, the Western firm Sassoon and the Japanese banking community took advantage of the cheap prices to scramble to buy, coupled with the weakening of the Hua merchants' willingness to sell, the situation immediately rebounded. It was estimated that the Western firm Sassoon and the Japanese banks, Zhengjin, Mitsui, and Sumitomo, successively bought spot British pounds from each foreign bank from 4 pence .625, gradually decreasing to .375, and also bought spot U.S. dollars from $9, gradually softening to $8.50. Near noon, the foreign firms' willingness to sell became strong again, so the situation rebounded to loosen. Extended to noon close, the banks' spot selling prices were 4 pence .53125 for the British pound and $8.8125 for the U.S. dollar. As a result, compared to the previous day, the British pound rebounded by .15625, and the U.S. dollar also rebounded by .3125. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Rise and Fall of the Hong Kong Shanghai Exchange Rate Was Sudden</p>
<p>Hong Kong, 22nd - Today's exchange market opened firmly, with spot prices against the U.S. dollar loosening by .03125 and spot prices against the U.S. dollar rising by .0625. The forward price opened at $28.50. The Shanghai exchange rate plummeted to $21, which was $500. There was a market but no transactions. The Japanese exchange rate loosened by .75 to $104.75. At 11:00, the Shanghai exchange rate rebounded by $25 to $325. At 11:30, it remained unchanged. The noon close still opened at the original level. There was no market in the afternoon on Saturday.</p>
<p>Tianjin Exchange Rates Slightly Lengthened</p>
<p>Tianjin, 22nd - Today's exchange market remained weak, with market conditions having transactions but no market. It loosened by .21875 against the U.S. dollar to 3 pence .21875, and lengthened by .375 against the U.S. dollar to $6.25. The Shanghai exchange rate rose by $6 to $140. The black market for "United Currency" was stable, opening low at $3,000, so it also fell sharply by $80. It was estimated that Datong Bank once changed the suspension of $280 to the lowest price of the day. More than five minutes later, because the 烚赤 suddenly rebounded, it also rebounded by $20. More than five minutes later (9:50), it continued to rebound by $20. At 10:25, it rebounded again by $30. There were no changes heard after that. As a result, it hung a small $10. Datong Bank changed the suspension to $350, and Xin Datong Bank was $348. There was no fixed price for closing.</p>
<h3>In a State of Confusion, the Gold Market Changes in an Instant, the Lowest Opening Price in the Morning Nearly Breaks the $3,000 Mark, Rumors Rise Again in the Afternoon, and No One Dares to Enter the Market Outside</h3>
<p>Yesterday's spot currency black market situation: The situation in the morning was still in a stormy sea, with the magnitude of the rise and fall changing every moment. The opening was weak, nearly breaking the $3,000 mark, and then it surged, breaking through the $3,500 mark. The difference between the high and low was as much as $540. In fact, people's hearts were still dazed, and there was a purchase and sale. People still regarded the tightness or looseness of foreign exchange as a transformation. At first, because it was heard that HSBC's internal disk was greatly relaxed, the general floating long positions felt uneasy. In addition, the silver building gangs absorbed a large amount of goods in the retail department the next day, which made them even more panic. For a time, everyone scrambled to sell, and only a wave of selling was heard. The sharp decline was like the horizontal jump the day before. The opening was actually pressed down by $565 to $3,000. Later, the downward trend was inevitably too fierce, and foreign exchange was tightened after being aggressively bought by Japanese banks and Western merchants, which triggered a buying frenzy. The money exchange industry searched in front, and the securities gangs and Hong Kong gangs vigorously entered later, so the market suddenly rebounded sharply, once soaring to a peak of $3,540. At noon, because foreign exchange rebounded, and there were rumors in the market that banks would impose restrictions on withdrawals again starting next week, the buying frenzy subsided slightly, and the market rebounded weakly, falling back to $3,470 at the close. In the afternoon, because it was Saturday and there was no market for foreign exchange, and the transactions made by the same industry in the afternoon on Saturday had to be settled on Monday of the following week, but in order to avoid risks due to the large waves in the gold price recently, the same industry decided to stop trading for half a day, resulting in no formal market prices. It was rumored that there were sellers at $3,430 outside the market, but no buyers. If calculated according to the noon close of $3,470, it continued to fall by $95. Half-day secondary transactions were still active, about 1,600 to 1,700 taels. Silver building ornaments also followed the sharp decline and then stepped back, and finally hung a small $10. Customs gold and Sino-British pure gold and other items did not change.</p>
<p>Currency Down $95</p>
<p>Since morning, each tael (ten liang) was initially unchanged. When it was heard that the foreign exchange market loosened sharply, the general holders of physical goods felt uneasy. It was said that the silver building gangs had received too much from the retail department the next day, so they were even more panicked. For a time, everyone scrambled to sell, mutually suppressing the price, but the buyers were even more afraid to take over. The market price was covered by a selling frenzy, and it was violently pressed down by $565.</p>
<h3>New Rumors Emerge in the Financial World, After Investigation, They Are Confirmed to Be Rumors, Confidence Should Be Restored</h3>
<p>Since the two restrictions on cash withdrawals and the two sharp contractions of foreign exchange, coupled with the speculation of officials and merchants, the belief in paying cash for deposits after "August 13" has been completely dispelled. Therefore, although it has been repeatedly declared that after the decision to restrict cash withdrawals, cash deposited in cash will still be paid in cash, how can trust be obtained? On the bank side, only banknotes are seen flowing out, and few are deposited. There are continuous reports that 40 million yuan of banknotes from North China are being transported to Shanghai to extract foreign exchange. Suddenly, the use of banknotes from North China was stopped, and in recent months, a certain bank took advantage of the convenience of various withdrawals to push out as many banknotes from North China as possible, and most of the paper was fresh, far from being old. The fox buries the fox slyly, only making the loyal depositors suffer losses, resulting in more rumors in the market and people's hearts floating, and the impact spread to commercial banks. How can the prevalence of withdrawals in recent days be covered up by fabricated propaganda to the ears and eyes of all people in the world? Yesterday, it was even rumored that a new method will be implemented on Monday tomorrow. As the rumors spread, withdrawals from various banks were even more prevalent. Some say that this is self-disturbance by mediocre people, and they do not remember who caused it. The rumors circulating in the market yesterday mainly included the following three points: (1) Starting tomorrow, the three restrictions on cash withdrawals will be reduced from 500 yuan per week to 150 yuan or 200 yuan, and the same restrictions will be imposed on the remittance withdrawals, with a maximum of 1,000 yuan per week. (2) Banks may change their business hours. (3) It is also said that a certain bank will move. These rumors would be difficult to believe in normal times, but today, rumors often become facts, making it impossible not to be fearful. However, after investigation, it was found that these three statements were completely unfounded and not factual. Why should a certain bank move again? And if there are three restrictions on cash withdrawals, or changes in business hours, or other new measures, it will never benefit the financial community, but will harm the financial community, and it will also be a collective attack, which is not a blessing for the financial community. Therefore, the urgent task today is to restore the public's confidence in the financial industry's deposits and withdrawals, and the rumors can be dispelled without refuting them. Of the huge, opening silver building gang sold 50 liang to the money exchange industry, the price was 3,000 yuan, and suddenly heard that the HSBC listing did not change, and the internal foreign exchange disk turned tight, triggering a buying frenzy, the money exchange industry and other scramble to absorb, in a flash, it rebounded by 200 yuan, the money exchange industry entered the silver building gang 50 liang, the price was 3,200 yuan, at that time the securities gang and the northern gang also came to vigorously enter, the market situation was even stronger, Soon, it was raised by 200 yuan, the securities gang entered the money exchange industry 50 liang, the price was 3,400 yuan, the buying momentum was slightly weaker, and the cross fell to 3,300 yuan, after which a certain silver building on behalf of the Hong Kong gang suddenly came to vigorously purchase, plus a certain gold shop (on behalf of speculators) and securities gangs also scrambled to search, although there was a silver building gang tending to hedge sell, but the position was still felt to be in short supply, the rise in prices, once soaring to a peak of 3,540 yuan, is the securities gang absorbed 50 liang of money exchange industry, when the money exchange industry made a profit and came out, once pressed down to 3,470 yuan, although a certain broker on behalf of the industry outside to profit and close, but a certain money exchange industry and securities gangs and other intentions are strong, the market situation turned upward, the securities gang into a certain broken 3,400 yuan to 500 yuan two major gold shop 50 liang, the price was 3,535 yuan, near noon, Suddenly heard that the foreign exchange market loose, and the enterers gradually reduced, the market situation declined, and broke into the 3,500 yuan, a certain gold shop sold to the securities gang 50 liang, 3,470 yuan for the noon closing price, heard that the market situation continued to be weak after the closing, 3,450 yuan that there are sellers and no enterers, in the afternoon because it is Saturday and there is no foreign exchange market, and encountered unprecedented changes, coupled with the afternoon transactions made by the industry, need to wait until the morning of Monday next week to deliver, want to be resolved by the industry in order to avoid unexpected dangers, stop trading for half a day, the results if calculated according to the noon closing of 3,470 yuan, the previous day then continued to fall 95 yuan, it has rebounded for two days, a total of 485 yuan, the whole day 540 yuan rise and fall, the spot cash number of the brand gold according to the currency is 10 yuan higher, and the current bid gold is according to the listing gold is about 50 yuan lower, according to inquiries, there is a slight transaction.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Fell Sharply and Rebounded Slightly</p>
<p>The silver building jewelry gold, each two of out-of-pocket, the initial did not change, until 9:40, when heard that</p>
<h3>Foreign Currency Continues to Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the British pure gold fell by half a pence, the British and American exchange rate rose by .0625, the local foreign exchange first loosened and then tightened, and the British, American gold pounds, initially because of the sharp fall in the currency, the scattered holders mostly supplied, the market situation was very soft, the demand for British and American gold notes was sparse, the money exchange industry supplied smoothly, the market price loosened, Hong Kong notes, French franc notes, Dutch notes, etc., the supply increased, all tending to be weak, Japanese gold notes were only a flash in the pan, and then tended to fall, The evening market was $1.10, the Korean ticket was more tired, the evening market was $0.87, and the Association's transactions were quite prosperous.</p>
<h3>Discount Rates Rise Again by $5</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for remittance drafts rose again after falling. In the morning, it once entered the 200 yuan within per thousand yuan, but soon there was demand for cash again, and at noon it rebounded to 205 yuan. In the afternoon, there were rumors that the silver money industry would reduce the weekly limit on deposits from 500 yuan to 200 yuan tomorrow, so it forked up another ten yuan, the highest 215 yuan, five yuan higher than the previous day. As for the money industry association's lending rate, it was still hanging at $0.16 in the morning and afternoon markets.</p>
<h3>Remittance Chips Are Tightening, Which Can Suppress Unnecessary Speculation</h3>
<p>Recently, remittance discounts have been rising day by day. In order to eliminate the illegal transaction of remittance discounts, Yu Zhenjun once had an article "Eliminating Remittance Discounts" (detailed in this newspaper on the 21st), explaining that remittance cuts should be stipulated by law, and discounts should not be allowed. As for the legitimate uses of industry and commerce, legal currency should be supplied as much as possible, and it is hoped that the silver money industry will not decide to give remittance to general depositors who have no legitimate uses, so as not to discount to the money exchange shops, and it is also advocated that the exchange should strictly restrict the use of remittances by the same industry, and implement tightening, etc. After the publication, yesterday it was heard that the exchange also had a circular to all the same industry that the remittance chips should not be loose, and implement tightening, the general idea is slightly said, "Our city's same industry because of the Ministry of Finance's Ma Dian announcement, there will be a tide of withdrawals and deposits, The silver money industry has been discussing and studying methods in the morning and evening in order to stabilize the financial affairs of our city, and has negotiated with the three lines to agree to convert the same industry's deposit of 22 million yuan into legal tender at 95% discount, in order to prepare the same industry to pay legal currency deposits of 500 yuan or less, and to separately determine the method of providing security for the use of remittances, in order to adjust the same industry to pay remittances of 500 yuan or more, It is now heard that the same industry has loose remittances, undertaking the pledge of goods, that is, using the goods as security for the use, so that the general hoarding of goods to rising prices, there is a trend to help speculation, which hinders the national economy and people's livelihood, and it is hoped that the banks and banks will tighten the chips for remittances in the future.</p>
<h3>Securities: Although Domestic Debt Rises, Momentum is Not Very Sustained; Foreign Debt Sees Mixed Gains and Losses</h3>
<p>Securities Gray Market: Yesterday's market conditions were such that, because the market price had already risen sharply after the close of the previous day, the market price remained extremely firm. However, it slightly eased in the middle of the day due to the emergence of many sellers. It also failed to stabilize after closing. This kind of sudden and unpredictable rise and fall is a phenomenon of people's hearts being uneasy. The day before yesterday, due to the rumor that Minister Song would resume his position as Minister of Finance, people's hearts were excited again because they thought there would be hope for finance. Yesterday, because the rise was too high, it attracted the emergence of more sellers, and the high price in the gray market could not be maintained, but it was still much higher than the official market price. This is because the use of foreign exchange drafts is narrow, and public debt is actually the end of foreign exchange drafts. Therefore, even though rumors continue, it has not changed drastically due to the suspension of principal and interest payments. After the interest subsidy is realized, there should still be good prospects. Yesterday, only Types A and C had more fluctuations, while the rest were extremely stable. Although there were many sellers, they were scattered and not concentrated. Major players have not been seen releasing large amounts, and although there were few buyers, their appetite was larger. Therefore, the result was still an increase of 2.10 to 3.05 yuan compared to the previous day. Only Type D has not been traded at all. After the market closed, gray market transactions were very rare, and the market price was slightly softer by 30 to 50 cents. The total number of transactions was estimated at 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A brief table is listed below:</p>
<p>Category　Highest　Lowest　Closing　Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>Unified A</p>
<p>53.00　51.50　52.02　Up 3.05</p>
<p>Unified B　44.30　43.50　44.00　Up 2.50</p>
<p>Unified C　44.80　42.50　41.00　Up 2.10</p>
<p>Unified D　————————</p>
<p>Unified E　43.20　42.40　42.85　Up 2.35</p>
<p>Stock Transactions: Transactions at the Chinese Business Securities Exchange involved receipts with a face value of 2,000 yuan, priced at 25 yuan per 100 yuan (face value is exactly 55 yuan).</p>
<p>The trading of the Public Industry Association's one-week settlement began. The transactions made in the morning were not very large. The industrial stock market still saw mixed results. Jardine stocks were slightly higher, Kailan stocks were stable, and telephone stocks rose to a new high price (13.20 yuan). Tram stocks were firm at a price of 43.50 yuan. The rubber stock market was quite firm. For example, Consolidate stocks were lower than other rubber stocks a few days ago, but now the price is slightly higher (5.50 yuan). A few days ago, company bonds had been neglected and few people inquired about them, and investing in stocks seemed to generate profits faster, but now there is slightly more demand for power bonds.

<h3>Textiles: European and American Dyes Surge, Demand for Non-Fading Cloth is Strong</h3>
<p>Domestic Cloth</p>
<p>Yesterday, the cloth market continued to rise. Speculators paid attention to searching for various non-fading cloths, because European and American dyes have risen the most sharply. The quoted prices of goods in stock at various factories have suddenly jumped by more than one yuan per bolt, and most have restricted sales quotas, and are expected to rise again. The quoted prices of white goods and other dyed and bleached goods have increased slightly by 10 cents to 25 cents per bolt. The majority of the day's transactions were still for hoarding purposes by insiders and outsiders. A total of more than 500 pieces of coarse cloth, fine cloth, fine twill, and bleached cloth were traded. Customers receiving orders were busier. Merchants from the north road Tianjin area extracted more than 300 boxes of woolen cloth, flannel, and blue cloth that had matured. Merchants from Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guangdong were also rapidly processing orders. New transactions were also weak. Only merchants from the Yantai area searched for more than 100 packages of coarse cloth from Dasheng. Due to exchange rate relations, merchants from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia had stronger appetites and traded more than 50 boxes of bleached fine cloth and fine twill, and more than 200 packages of fine twill and coarse cloth. Shipments from wholesale shops on this street were also mainly for processing orders.</p>
<p>East Textiles</p>
<p>Due to weak actual sales, the market for fine cloth and fine twill declined. In the morning, the spot price of "Dragon Head" fine cloth once fell to 14.25 yuan. The market slightly firmed at the close of the afternoon session, rising to 14.30 yuan per bolt, with next month's price at 14.80 yuan. Japanese trading companies still had high expectations and did not sell at all, and even bought 100 pieces of "Dragon Head" fine cloth at 14.30 yuan.</p>
<p>Exports</p>
<p>On the 23rd, 270 pieces of textiles were shipped to Haiphong and 175 pieces to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains: Northern Merchants Actively Trade Broad Beans; High-Grade Prices Return to the 7 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The broad bean market has been thriving in recent days due to the low prices of other grains, which has attracted hoarding by various merchants, and there have also been merchants from North China, Yantai, and Weihai actively trading, coupled with the opportunity of drastic financial changes. The market prices of high-grade goods have mostly returned to the 7 yuan mark. Yesterday, the prices in various markets rose by another 20 cents. A total of more than 100 packages of Chongming green skin broad beans were traded, priced at 7 yuan; 60 packages of Dachang green skin broad beans, priced at 7.15 yuan; 400 to 500 packages of Nanxiang green skin, priced at 6.97 to 7.10 yuan; 40 packages of Pudong green skin, priced at 6.65 yuan; more than 100 packages of Minhang green skin, priced at 6.60 yuan; 340 packages of Wujiang small-grain green skin, priced at 6.37 to 6.40 yuan; and 200 packages of Maojia market green skin, priced at 7.25 yuan.</p>
<p>On the 22nd, 152 tons of beans were shipped to Bombay and 85 tons to Colombo. On the 23rd, 2,780 packages were shipped to Hong Kong. On the 23rd, 1,850 cans of raw oil were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton: The Strange Wind Has Passed, the Yarn Market is Full of Selling Voices, Popular Goods Plummet by 40 Yuan</h3>
<p>The rapid advance and retreat of the yarn market, with the rise of the previous day and the fall of yesterday, made people frightened. The difference between the high and low of one rise and one fall has reached a huge 100 yuan. This kind of situation is entirely a terrifying situation created by general speculators. However, actual transactions have been greatly reduced. However, judging the future by measuring the chips in the market, it is still in a state of illusion and uncertainty.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning opening of the spot yarn market, the market situation was mediocre, and it was delayed until 9:30 before the market opened. The strange wind of the previous day had passed, and everyone was watching and not moving. General mobile brokers were all shouting to sell Double Horse yarn. Buyers were afraid and shrank back. The opening price immediately fell by 20 yuan. The foreign warehouse price of 20-count Double Horse yarn was 554 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 540 yuan. However, the acceptance was not as crazy as before, and transactions were not strong. After a short while, more said that the foreign counters were extending their positions, and rumors were rampant, saying that gold had plummeted and entered the 3,000 yuan mark. For a time, the selling sentiment was pervasive, and the shouting was deafening. It fell another 20 yuan. The foreign warehouse Double Horse yarn was traded at 534 to 535 yuan, and the warehouse receipt was also traded down to 523 to 524 yuan. Judging from this state, there must be people stirring up trouble in the middle. Before long, a certain yarn shop suddenly came in with dozens to hundreds of packages of warehouse receipt yarn. For a time, they shouted each other again, and the market price gradually rose by 10 yuan. The high price of the warehouse receipt reached 540 yuan again, and the foreign warehouse goods were again traded at 550 yuan. By the time of closing, it was heard that the foreign exchange market was quiet and people's enthusiasm was dissipated, and it fell back again. The foreign warehouse price of Double Horse yarn was 541 yuan, and the warehouse receipt price was 532 yuan. Judging from the enthusiastic sentiment of the market, a firm rise is certain, but there is no need to raise and press so high and recklessly. As a result, the total transaction volume for half a day was 1,465 packages. The market price of 20-count Double Horse yarn plummeted by 37.5 yuan, Shepherd yarn fell by 18 yuan, and 20-count Special Jincheng yarn fell by 40 yuan. Today's export cotton yarn has 770 pieces shipped to Hong Kong and 245 pieces to Haiphong. The amount purchased by each gang is listed separately as follows: Hong Kong 295, Yunnan 80, Mainland 20, Industry Peers 1,080, Previous Day's Transactions 425.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market also fell back quickly. In fact, people's hearts mostly look favorably on the market, but the financial situation is getting tighter, and cash is scarce. In addition, small-scale cloth factories have closed down one after another, and demand has decreased significantly. The current price of 20-count Yueqin yarn initially fell by 14 yuan, and then rebounded slightly by 4 yuan to 416 yuan.</p>
<h3>US Cotton Export Subsidy Will Begin on August 1st; Several Indian Cotton Settlement Prices Daily</h3>
<p>Foreign Cotton Market Price: The New York cotton market opened 3 to 4 points higher than the previous day. Although Liverpool and Bombay telegraphed declines, the cotton price did not fall due to the progress of spot transactions and the smooth sales of cloth. Later, due to the rise in New York stocks and purchases by the industry, the market was firm. As a result, New York rose by 13 to 14 points. It is heard that the US government's long-discussed issue of US cotton export subsidies will be announced within days and will be implemented starting on August 1st. Yesterday, Indian cotton fell by 2 rupees and Egyptian cotton fell by more than 10 points.</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Cotton Transactions: Yesterday, there were slightly more transactions in Pingguo'er cotton. The spot price of Tongzhou cotton was 107.00. Industry Peers purchased 500 packages, foreign exchange settlement at the warehouse was 110.00. Bailuoyun cotton was 100.00. Renmao Company purchased 200 pieces, banknotes at 102.00. Yuanxingde Company purchased 400 pieces.</p>
<p>A large batch of Indian cotton will arrive tomorrow. The Lelernbank of the Baohua Trading Company, coming from Karachi, is carrying more than 5,000 tons of cotton. The ship will arrive in port tomorrow and will dock at the Whangpoo River.</p>
<h3>Speculative Steps are Uneven, Yarn Prices are Chaotic and Indescribable, Goods from the Same Yarn Factory Differ by 60 to 70 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Shanghai cotton yarn and cotton cloth market has a precarious air about it since the implementation of restrictions on withdrawals. Unexpectedly, the recent extreme plunge in foreign exchange has suddenly turned the market around from near collapse, bringing fortune in misfortune. And the surge is drastic, but the market situation is extremely chaotic. The selling price of the same cotton yarn, the same product from the same yarn factory, differs by 20 to 30 yuan, even 60 to 70 yuan. As for the distance between the unpopular goods of new factories and the popular yarn prices of old factories, the distance is getting farther and farther. This kind of situation is rare in the history of the yarn industry. It is conceivable that the minds of general speculators are dazed and uncertain. It is found that the highest price of 20-count Double Horse yarn has reached 542 yuan, but 20-count Tiannv yarn only sells for 510 yuan, which is a huge 32 yuan lower (both are products of the Shenxin factory). The price of 20-count Shepherd yarn is 416 yuan, and the price of 20-count Golden Rooster yarn is 460 yuan (both are sold for cash by British merchants), which is a difference of 44 yuan. As for the 20-count yarn produced by new factories, since there are few inquiries, the selling price differs from 20-count Double Horse yarn by as much as 60 to 70 yuan. 10-count coarse yarn also has the same pathological state. The price of 10-count Lion yarn only sells for 385 yuan, and the price of 10-count Special Jincheng yarn is 480 yuan. Compared with each other, it is almost 100 yuan different. This chaotic scene like hemp shows that the steps of speculators are uneven. After all, cotton yarn is a commodity. I am deeply afraid that like gold and drafts, once there is a reaction, it will be difficult to suppress. Looking back at 1932, it also followed the golden tide and moved forward, followed by high prices and weakened consumption. Once it was a complete collapse. In fact, extreme things must turn back, which is the law of nature. The current situation is of course different, but the price has also entered a high realm.</p>
<h3>The Price Limit for Rice Has Actually Been Broken</h3>
<p>Dujian rice: Since the continuous surge, its momentum has risen straight up, and it seems difficult to contain. Fortunately, the concession authorities have repeatedly declared strict price limits. 87 or 88 yuan is sold among industry peers. If such Indian cotton is settled with foreign firms, it can be settled at 96 yuan according to yesterday's exchange rate. Therefore, in recent days, there have been several cases of Indian cotton settlement prices daily. According to this environment, foreign cotton transactions will be exhausted in the future, and factories can only reduce their work. Wait for the opportunity to turn around in the future.</p>
<p>There are slightly more Chinese and foreign cotton transactions, but the factory is mediocre, because legal tender is difficult to obtain and the discount rate is extremely high. Due to the sunny weather in northern Jiangsu, the hurricane has dissipated, shipping has resumed, and 156 packages of Tongzhou cotton have arrived. The current cotton situation is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Unloading at the Donghongxing Wharf, it is heard that the ship is managed by the Japanese Yamashita Company. The cotton is all mined and transported by Japanese merchants, so the exact number is unknown.</p>
<p>Although the rice industry ostensibly complies, it has actually broken the price limit for Zhongjue rice. The market was active again yesterday. Foreign merchants continued to pull in, and even some non-industry speculators fueled the flames, causing the market to remain chaotic. High-quality goods were not sampled. However, goods like thick and thin japonica rice, Zhongjue rice, Suxi rice and reheated rice saw a further price increase in the gray market, all reaching the limit price, opening at 20 yuan, and yellow and miscellaneous rice also opening at 19.70 or 80 cents. Although it seems to be a settled situation on the surface, if the rice quality is considered, it is 20 to 30 cents better than yesterday. Therefore, this kind of market has lost the standard, and the form of the existing price limit is dry. Duyang rice and Jian rice also mutually increased by 20 to 30 cents.</p>
<p>Bianyuan rice: Although the outgoing route is still normal, if the Hong Kong glutinous rice is settled according to the previous foreign exchange rate, it must be sold for 27 or 8 yuan, but the actual opening price is 20.02 yuan, so it also increased by more than 30 cents. In short, regardless of japonica, Jian or glutinous rice, they all soared. Compared with the previous lowest price, it has risen by more than 2.5 yuan to 3 yuan. If there were no price limit, the rising wind would probably not know what it would be like. According to statistics, there were no goods arriving from Xiahe, and only 9 carloads of Changzhou and Southern Gang goods arrived by the Chelin Paozi, totaling more than 1,100 packages. More than 15,700 packages were traded. Today is Sunday, and the market is closed for business.</p>
<p>Kezhou rice: Zhongjue machine-milled rice and crushed rice continued to increase by 20 to 30 cents. Because the source is gradually decreasing, and a batch is lost on the way, and in addition to local distribution, the inland countryside has also started to ship. Yesterday, both stores and customers were greedy, and a total of 4,700 to 4,800 packages were offered in the market. However, particularly high-quality goods have been verified to be above the 16 yuan limit, and there are still no formal transactions in the market.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: The recently arrived Saigon rice has not been officially sampled because the suppliers are firmly holding on. Yesterday, because local Kezhou rice rose again, and there was a lack of high-quality Kezhou rice sampling, the new Saigon rice was of good quality and was welcomed by importers. Therefore, it was sold at a high price of 24 yuan yesterday. A total of 300 packages were traded, still in the original 198-catty packages.</p>
<h3>Spot Flour Suddenly Rises by 10 Cents</h3>
<p>Wheat Suddenly Inquired After by Southern Merchants</p>
<p>Wheat Flour: Yesterday, the spot flour market turned upward. Since the drastic changes in the foreign exchange and gold markets, the prices of goods in Shanghai have been soaring, and the flour market has also been secretly firm, actually suppressed by the goods returning to the market. Therefore, the factory price has been slow to increase. In recent days, fewer and fewer goods have been returned, and customer demand is quite greedy. Therefore, starting yesterday, the No. 2 flour factory's price has increased from 4.65 yuan to 4.75 yuan, a sudden increase of 10 cents compared to the previous day. It is heard that the price of returned goods has also risen to 5.40 or 50 cents for foreign exchange settlement. It is also rumored that customers are requesting payment by foreign exchange settlement, and the factory is also rumored to have opened sales at 5.60 yuan for foreign exchange settlement. A total of 30,000 packages were traded in the market. In addition to more than 10,000 packages of retail sales in the local and inland areas, the rest were purchased by northern and southern merchants in small quantities.</p>
<p>Wheat: The wheat market also held firm yesterday. Recently, amid the rising prices of goods, hoarders have repeatedly absorbed it. In addition to a small number of direct shipments to factories, the Nanyang and Hong Kong merchants, in view of the wheat price, which is still cheap, have also slightly absorbed it at this time. A total of 1,680 packages of Suzhou, Kunshan, Changzhou, and Mingguang wheat were sold in the market, priced at 6.85 to 7.73 yuan. The market is also slightly tighter.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Sugar Prices Fall Across the Board</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight easing of foreign exchange, and there was also a decline in London telegraphic transfers: August at 7 shillings, December at 6 shillings 2 and one-half pence, March next year at 6 shillings 2 and three-quarters pence. Dutch telegraphic transfers: the repurchase price continued to ease slightly, September at 7.20 Dutch guilders. The local market, which had risen sharply for several days, also fell by about one yuan. The association's price limits: No. 24 coarse white current goods at the local warehouse at 34 yuan, the foreign warehouse at 33.80 yuan, transit goods initially fell to 26 yuan for 200 packages, then fell by another half a yuan to 25.5 yuan for 500 packages. Taikoo chariot white B mark West warehouse at 36 yuan, East warehouse at 5.5 yuan, West warehouse CW mark at 35.5 yuan, CX mark at 35.3 yuan, DY mark at 35 yuan, HX mark at 34.7 yuan, H mark chariot red at 22 yuan, Dutch red current goods at 26.5 yuan, transit at 20 yuan, local No. 1 white at 33 yuan, No. 1 crystal at 39 yuan, Jingming crystal at 40.5 yuan. Domestic sugar also showed a sluggish trend, due to the industry's lack of strong appetites, resulting in a lack of transactions. According to Gulangyu telegraphic transfers, the Xiamen green settlement price in the Shanghai market requires 17 yuan in cash.</p>
<h3>Seafood: Domestic Shrimp Tails are Actively Sold; Jinshan Shrimp Tails Have Extremely High Costs</h3>
<p>Domestic shrimp tails have active sales because the cost of foreign goods is extremely expensive. Recently, long-whisker shrimp tails are priced at 140 yuan, Yangjiaogou tails at 130 yuan, and Wenzhou dried shrimp at 80 yuan, all traded for cash. It is found that the cost of Jinshan tails calculated at the current exchange rate is more than 400 yuan. Although there have been no arrivals recently, the local market still has inventory, but it is only priced at 200 yuan (cash). Because domestic goods can be substituted, there are few takers.</p>

<h3>Disturbances at a Church in Suzhou</h3>
<p>There is a church facing the street in Suzhou, with a small chapel behind it, and finally a residence for Western women. On a recent Sunday, some Chinese converts came from Hangzhou to discuss religious doctrines with the converts of the two churches. At that time, many Suzhou women brought their children to listen to the lectures. Some were in the church, and some were newcomers. There were no fewer than thirty or fifty women in total. People on the street saw too many women inside the door, and rumors spread that Westerners were going to gouge out children's eyes. Because it happened to be a wedding day for a prominent family, there were many people watching the hundred-flower sedan chair, so more and more people came to knock on the church door, intending to make a commotion at the church to amuse themselves and join in the fun. The priests inside the door repeatedly advised them not to make a fuss, but they paid no attention and knocked on the door more urgently, threatening to knock it down. Therefore, the priests had no choice but to unlock and open the door, allowing them to enter and see. However, the crowd was noisy and hindered the lectures, so they soon wanted to ask them to leave. At that time, half left and half stayed, and the door could not be closed. Those who watched saw nothing strange and also wanted to leave. Suddenly, someone shouted, "Where are the children you want to kill hidden?" The tone was severe! Some Western priests who could speak Chinese persuaded them gently, but they were pushed or squeezed, but in their hearts, they had no malice. Among the four or five hundred people, only a dozen or twenty people wanted to start a conflict. The rest probably wanted to take the opportunity to see the interior of the Western house and broaden their horizons. At that time, a Westerner went to the county government. If the magistrate had not returned, the person in charge sent five bailiffs, and the village head had also arrived. When the crowd saw the bailiffs arrive, they all dispersed in a huff.</p>
<h3>Seeking Pregnancy at the Confucius Temple</h3>
<p>There is a Confucius Temple in Runzhou, with two stone lions in front of its door, and candle holders and incense burners arranged in front of them, with flourishing incense! I was curious and asked about it. The person guarding the temple told me, "If a woman is infertile, she only needs to burn candles and sandalwood in front of the stone lions, and she will get a son. This is the custom of Runzhou." Alas! People in Shandong seek pregnancy from foxes, people in Hunan seek pregnancy from monkeys, and this is seeking pregnancy from stone lions.</p>

<h3>Hard Work</h3>
<p>— By Bolin Hill</p>
<p>——The Only Way to Success</p>
<p>Coffee, like tea in our country, is originally a very ordinary drink in Western countries, but it is truly unbelievable to say: Italian Prime Minister Mussolini said that he had never even dreamed of tasting coffee before the age of twenty. Judging from this, the circumstances of that Italian "co-king" in his childhood probably were not better than yours. According to multiple sources of evidence, he once robbed two English women of food used for a picnic in a park, had his fingerprints taken at the Geneva Police Station in Switzerland, and was arrested by the police in Italy as many as eleven times. His behavior at the time was simply regarded as vulgar. However, because he was able to work hard, in other words, he was able to endure all the hardships that others could not endure; whether as a mason, tailor, chocolate factory worker, or newspaper reporter, he had tried them all. Therefore, the result was finally success, a great success. Although we dare not agree with his behavior, it is truly admirable that the son of a blacksmith was able to become a world-renowned great man, and his perseverance is indeed too moving for us to emulate. In addition, such people as Rockefeller, the "oil king," Kellogg, the initiator of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and MacDonald, the first Labour Prime Minister of Britain, all came from humble beginnings and achieved success through hard work.</p>
<p>Dear children, especially those in harsh circumstances: (I believe that those who can read this publication are mostly of upper primary level) do you now need to bear the living expenses of your families? Do you have to deliver newspapers for newspaper offices early in the morning? Do you have to do odd jobs for others in the evening? Although you naturally have to work in order to reduce the burden on your father, you may feel pain or discouragement, but when you know everything that the once invincible Mussolini went through before his success, you really should not underestimate yourselves. Whether you are studying, working part-time while studying, or working children, you should all work hard in your respective positions! Work hard! Endure all the hardships that others cannot endure; then the result will definitely be the reward you have exchanged for your labor, and you will definitely not be disappointed. Dear children, remember the two sentences said by the author of the autobiography of a successful black slave: "The more setbacks and difficulties a person encounters, the greater his success will be."</p>
<h3>Model Summer Life</h3>
<p>— By Nv Yuan</p>
<p>Jue Min, during the first week of the vacation, loved to play like the rest of the children, and would not stop until he had played to his heart's content, completely relaxing the tension of the big exams of the past few days. But after a week, he felt tired and bored. He was terribly bored at times. After all, he was a studious and hardworking child, so he automatically set up a flexible timetable and followed it step by step every day, feeling very satisfied.</p>
<p>However, when he discovered that there were many illiterate and wandering children around his home, he suddenly felt sympathy, feeling that it was a pity that they were wasting their precious childhood. Moreover, the teachings of teachers and parents to serve and help others were deeply imprinted in his mind. He thought that this long summer vacation was not the best opportunity to practice it? So he told his parents what he thought. How happy his parents were! They specially vacated a small room to serve as their reading place. Jue Min was particularly busy, arranging the classroom and selecting materials! And he no longer felt empty and bored.</p>
<p>With the support of his parents, the gratitude of the parents, and the curiosity of the children, Jue Min's school opened last Monday. The small room was crowded with many children who were about to receive education, like a private school. However, the teacher was an energetic young teacher. He initially taught them simple Chinese characters, so patiently and sincerely, again and again. These children also found it quite interesting and studied very hard. After a few days, Jue Min's beautiful fruit was formed. The children were no longer bright-eyed blind people who did not know a single word. Gradually, their desire for knowledge grew day by day. Jue Min sometimes felt his lack of knowledge, so when he encountered difficult problems, he would go to ask his father or sister, thereby also increasing his knowledge a lot. At this time, he realized a sentence said by the teacher: "Helping others is helping yourself." Isn't that right? Jue Min not only increased his knowledge, but his ability to handle affairs was also much more mature. Therefore, from then on, he worked harder to teach these children, because their progress! is his own progress!</p>

<h3>Border Crossing</h3>
<p>— Bai Zheng</p>
<p>— Record of Avoiding Disaster Tomorrow, Part 26 —</p>
<p>Ming'er and his companions were not entirely unlucky. Although the Jiangshan boat had been away from Hangzhou for almost a week, they had not encountered any rainy days.</p>
<p>But on this morning, as the Jiangshan boat set off, dark clouds in the sky seemed to have received a rallying call, gathering together and forming a dense formation, waiting somberly for the order to launch their all-out attack. The sun was so frightened that it dared not peek out. Soon after the boat departed, Ming'er was forced to get up, his eyes still heavy with sleep. He felt heavy all over, not as refreshed as on a sunny day. Seeing how ominous the sky was, he knew that it would definitely rain today. Heaven showed no mercy, letting this group of unfortunate refugees taste the flavor of a rainy day.</p>
<p>Sure enough, as he expected, after they had finished breakfast, Heaven gave the order for a full-scale attack. Raindrops came slashing down to the ground in torrents. The sound of the rain mingled with the roar of the angry wind, pounding down relentlessly. The boatman, with a worried frown, sent his companions to fetch their rain gear—straw raincoats and bamboo hats—from the shore (because they had been tracking the boat from the banks).</p>
<p>"It's raining again! How annoying." The boatman muttered to himself with resentment, as he put on his bamboo hat and fastened the strap behind his head. Ming'er was deeply worried for him, thinking that it was no wonder he was concerned. He thought that the hat seemed to be just sitting on the boatman's head, without any secure connection, and that it would be blown away in a strong gust of wind. But Ming'er was being foolish; did the boatman not know that? He craned his neck and stared blankly at the boatman putting on his straw raincoat, because he had never seen one before. Without realizing it, he opened his mouth wide, and in his heart, he really wanted to wear a straw raincoat; this thing was so interesting.</p>
<p>It rained for half the day, accompanied by a headwind all morning. The planks in front of the cabin had been open for a long time, so the wind and rain relentlessly blew into the cabin. The bedding on the planks was soaked with rain and damp, how would they sleep at night? Ming'er was really worried, but what use was worrying? The elements continued to batter them without any courtesy, so he could only passively drag the bedding in a little further. But the rain still did not let up, the raindrops mischievously sneaking in through the cracks in the boat awning, dripping down one by one, while the wind laughed nearby, praising its clever skills.</p>
<p>In the misty rain, they passed the last small town in Zhejiang Province—Weiping—at noon.</p>
<p>The rain continued to fall, but the wind was a little weaker. Ming'er sat blankly in the cabin, feeling extremely bored. He didn't feel like reading, he couldn't sleep soundly, and when he looked at the scenery outside, it was raining, so he couldn't enjoy it. Sitting blankly, sitting blankly... time passed moment by moment.</p>
<p>"Sir, I'm going ashore to ask them to come and inspect," the boatman poked his head in and continued, "This is the border between Anhui and Zhejiang, we have to be inspected before we can set sail." After saying these words, he went ashore. When Ming'er heard these words, he stood up and stretched his head out to take a look, he saw a long gangplank and short houses in the distance. He didn't dare to look any further, because the rain was annoyingly dripping down his neck. Later, three people ran up, looked under the cabin planks, and then left. Ming'er later learned that if the boat was carrying any wine or salt, it had to be taxed when entering Anhui Province, no wonder things were more expensive.</p>
<h3>The Ice-Selling Boy</h3>
<p>— Chen Nianyun</p>
<p>There wasn't a trace of wind, and the earth seemed to have stopped breathing. A ball of blazing sun sat high in the sky, relentlessly blasting heat into the universe, the weather was so hot that people could barely breathe.</p>
<p>"Ice, oh! ... Ice, oh! ... Selling ice, oh!"</p>
<p>This was the cry of a child only eight years old, and his voice was remarkably loud.</p>
<p>The child's surname was Su, and his given name was Jingping. He was a very lively child. His father was a rickshaw puller, and his mother worked in a yarn factory. Because he also needed to eat, he came to do this ice-selling business in the scorching summer.</p>
<p>He ran and shouted every day under the blazing sun! Sweat dripped from his forehead, and the asphalt on the road was melted by the scorching sun, the ground was so hot that it burned the feet; but he was not afraid of the heat, he dared not stop to rest for a while, and he dared not take a small piece of ice from his basket to suck on, because he was ashamed, so big and still doing such childish things, how embarrassing! Too bad if one copper coin isn't earned, he'll go hungry.</p>
<p>He walked past the entrance of a school and saw many elementary school students sitting on chairs reading books. How clean the classroom was! He also walked past a park and saw many children bouncing balls on the grass, telling jokes under the trees, and watching goldfish by the pond. How envious he was! But he was a poor child, and he could only experience this kind of happiness in his dreams.</p>
<p>The weather was so hot that it made people dizzy, and the sun scorched the ground so much that it burned the feet, but this ice-selling boy was still running and shouting on the road!</p>
<p>"Ice, oh! ... Ice, oh! ... Selling ice, oh!"</p>
<p>This was the cry of a child only eight years old, and his voice was remarkably loud.</p>
<h3>Biting Your Nails Is Like Eating Microorganisms</h3>
<p>— Zheng Guoqi</p>
<p>Class began, the teacher walked into the classroom, I glanced at the teacher, and then lowered my head, what was I doing? My old habit of biting my nails was acting up! I felt ashamed to be seen by the teacher. The teacher said, "There are microorganisms in your nails, biting your nails is no different from eating microorganisms." That's right! Microorganisms aren't good to eat! They'll make you sick if you eat them. As I thought about this, the bell rang, ding, ding, ding, and class was over, and the teacher left. I raised my hand and looked closely, there was a black and dirty thing at the front of my nail, there must be microorganisms in there, microorganisms can't be eaten! Ah, I've realized it, I'll never bite my nails again; and I quickly used scissors to cut off the half-inch of nail that had grown, and used soap to wash away the dirt inside my nails, ah, I've realized it! From today on, I will never have this bad habit of biting my nails again!</p>
<h3>In the Realm of Animals (10)</h3>
<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>Peng Qi anxiously said, "No, no, there wouldn't be any silk in my body; but there are indeed quite a few copper and lead wires in my pockets." The spider said, "Never mind that, you call it wire, I call it silk, wire or silk, it's all the same thing anyway. And the stomach and the pocket, I think they're not much different either. Good—"</p>
<p>Just as the spider was preparing to impart its web-weaving lessons to Peng Qi, a sudden flapping sound was heard. It was the story-loving titmouse, who had suddenly flown over, whispering to the birds, beasts, and small animals, spreading the word from one to two, and two to three, inquiring about who Peng Qi was, and what kind of person he was.</p>
<p>The result of this inquiry immediately caused an uproar. All the flying and walking creatures raised their voices, shouting angrily at Peng Qi, "Damn you! Demon!" "Damn you! Demon!" An old tomcat puffed up its tail, ran to a tree, and let out a very disgusted sound: "Poo-oh!" The words "Poo-oh" were derogatory terms in the animal realm, equivalent to calling humans "animals."</p>
<p>In that instant, there was utter chaos. The titmouse, who loved to talk, was even more excited, jumping back and forth on the branches, saying a word here and a word there, intensifying the tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>A lioness, who was a great-grandmother among her own kind, was particularly fat, so bloated that she could barely move. At this time, she was also very excited, saying to the crowd, "Please everyone think about it, if we were to go down below, I don't know how he would deal with us!" The titmouse immediately chimed in, "But he's here, right in the palm of your hand!"</p>
<p>When the other animals heard this, they shouted in unison, "Yes, yes! He's in our hands, don't let him go! Punish him! Punish him! Take him to the lion!" So, many animals crowded around Peng Qi and took him to the lion, still shouting, "Punish him! Punish him!"</p>
<p>A donkey came forward and said: Let me punish him! Let me first embed a cold piece of iron in his teeth, and strike it back and forth between the corners of his mouth. Let me pull him along as he runs, while whipping him on his body. Let me beat his head, kick his tendons, whip his back, and stab his waist; then I will force him to run quickly, run for his life, change his bad temper, and then press heavy things on his back, teaching him how to trot quickly, while giving him the full benefit of the saddle and bridle.</p>
<p>The lion busily stopped him: "Wait, wait, my friend, you are saying these things because you are angry for the moment; but if you want me to be the judge, we must deal with this sinner with justice."</p>
<h3>Joy (4)</h3>
<p>To obtain true and great joy, one must completely obey God's word (the Bible), word for word, sentence by sentence. Some people say that this is too difficult. The words in the Bible are too far removed from the secular world, and we are secular people, how can we obey the words of the Bible sentence by sentence? I say, please don't worry, when I say believing in God, obeying God, I mean doing it willingly. The question is whether you are willing, not whether you are able. Willing or able are two different questions. God only asks people for a willing heart, as for what one is unable to do, God is patient, tolerant, and waiting, and will never sever the communion between God and man because of this. For example, a father commands his son to "go to the vineyard and work." The son obeys and goes, this is being willing. As for whether he walks fast or slow, how many times he falls on the road, how much work he does in the garden, whether it is good or bad, these are all matters of ability. The loving father does not dwell on these. God is a loving father, and it is the same. If someone says that walking too slowly, stumbling on the road, doing too little work in the garden, or doing it badly, God will punish them, turning God into the most severe father, that is the devil's reasoning, don't listen to it. The Bible is the command that God gives to people. When you read the Bible, as long as you answer with a "yes" from the deepest part of your conscience, word by word, sentence by sentence (don't deceive yourself), that is faith. God will surely commend you, saying "good," this is justification by faith. When God calls you righteous, when God calls you righteous, your joy will surely be immediately satisfied, and no hardship or suffering in the world can steal away your joy.

<h3>Beware of Cold Drinks</h3>
<p>— Zixi</p>
<p>Now it is the height of summer, and street vendors are competing to sell various cold drinks and items. Like shaved ice; popsicles; cold jelly; sour plum soup; mung bean soup; and other fruits, they call out sales along the roads, and business is quite thriving. However, most of these cold drinks and items are not very hygienic, because shaved ice, popsicles, cold jelly, sour plum soup, mung bean soup, etc., are mostly made with raw water. Naturally, raw water inevitably contains unclean debris and pathogens; in addition, things like watermelon and other fruits are mostly left uncovered, allowing flying dust to constantly settle on them, and insects like flies to spread germs at will. Naturally, dust is mixed with more microorganisms. In addition, fruits are most prone to spoilage, and when food spoils, there is no doubt that bacteria will be abundant. In short: no matter what kind of cold drinks and items are sold along the roads, nineteen out of ten are unclean and unhygienic. If you accidentally eat them, the weak will immediately develop symptoms; even if you are strong, you will inevitably get sick over time. Of course, in this blazing heat, with sweat pouring down, everyone wants to reduce the desire for thirst and heat, it is the same for everyone, everyone needs it. However, when drinking, you must pay more attention to cleanliness and hygiene. You must know that reducing the problem of thirst and heat is indeed important, but the problem of paying attention to hygiene is even more important. Nowadays, there are often many children! Rushing to buy cold drinks along the road, but they do not know that there is a great danger here. I hope that the children will pay special attention and be extra careful, and it is best to refuse to buy all such things.</p>

<h3>The Life of a Nurse</h3>
<p>— Xinliang</p>
<p>They must have a loving and gentle nature. After the war, many served wounded soldiers and refugees.</p>
<p>Wearing a white hat on their head, a white uniform on their body, white socks, white shoes... the impression of a "nurse" is probably quite profound. Indeed, their actions are solemn; their attitude is sincere; their words are gentle, and there is simply nothing about them that gives people a bad impression. In this great era today, the mission and work of "nurses" is even more important and indispensable. Here, let the writer report some of their daily lives.</p>
<p>"In the entire women's job industry, I think this job of being a nurse can indeed be considered the noblest and most sacred. In various European and American countries, the status of nurses is really highly regarded by the general public in society. Whether they are men, women, old, or young, almost everyone respects them and admires them. This is not a lie, it is all because of their sincerity and diligent service."</p>
<p>A friend of mine recently had a serious illness, and the doctor told him to go to the hospital for diagnosis and treatment. Because I had visited him many times in the hospital, I met several nurses, and I talked to them several times. One of them, Miss Li, gave me an excellent impression, so I spent more time talking to her. Whenever I asked her, "What are your thoughts on your profession?" she would tell me the passage above. The loving and gentle expression on her face as she spoke was truly endearing.</p>
<p>"Could you briefly describe your daily life?" I asked her.</p>
<p>"Speaking of our lives as nurses? People generally see us wearing very neat uniforms and clean white leather shoes, and everyone thinks that our lives are very comfortable and pleasant, but in reality, our lives, well, 'clean and tidy' is very accurate, but comfortable and pleasant are simply out of the question."</p>
<p>"Our working hours," she continued, "are not fixed. Usually, we have several nurses taking turns on duty, that's how it is at meal times and at night. After finishing work, most of us go home to live, but there are also many who live in the hospital all the time."</p>
<p>"What are the most important qualities that a nurse needs to have?" I asked her another question.</p>
<p>"A nurse must first have a very strong sense of patience. Sometimes, the fatigue of work, the patient's temper, and other unsatisfactory things will indeed make you angry. If you don't have great patience, then the opinions that people give you will probably be very bad. Second, nurses must have a loving and gentle nature. Patients in bed, especially those who are seriously ill and have been in the hospital for a long time, are mostly very irritable and have a terrible temper. If we are all unkind and stiff, then the results and impact on the patient will be extremely bad. Third, nurses also need to have a habit of loving neatness and cleanliness, because we do not allow any stains to be seen on anything in the hospital, so nurses should not make the beds, tables, chairs, and all medical equipment dirty." Miss Li seemed to be very straightforward with me, and she told me everything she wanted to say in her heart.</p>
<p>Finally, she also told me a lot about their activities in their spare time, and I will write it down here as well.</p>
<p>"In addition to our nursing work, we have also specially gathered a few like-minded friends to organize a reading club. Our purpose is to use the spare time after work to read books and to seek some improvement in knowledge and skills. Every Saturday or Sunday, we occasionally go to the cinema to spend half a day. In reality, many nurses rush home to take care of housework and hold babies after finishing work; some are even more willing to abandon their families and go to the front lines to serve wounded soldiers and refugees. Their spirit and ambition are even more worthy of our admiration."</p>
<h3>One of the Works from the Famous Maritime Artists' Calligraphy and Painting Fan Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Xie Shiyue, Fang Mengren, Ma Gongyu Collaboration</p>
<h3>Biographies of Female Storytellers</h3>
<p>— Shen You</p>
<p>Of these twenty-eight people, six also appear in the "Twenty-Four Female Flower Paintings with Poems" by the recluse Mian Chi: Li Peilan, Yuan Yuexian, Zhu Sulan, Zhu Youqing, Zhu Xiangqing, and Yang Yunqing. Of the remaining eighteen not recorded in the "Book List," I have previously introduced eight: Shi Yuelan, Chen Yuezhen, Yan Lizhen, Wang Youjuan, Zhu Youxiang, Wu Suqing, Yuan Yunxian, and Zhu Suqing. The following ten have not been previously mentioned: Zhu Qinxian, Shen Yuechun, Yuan Xuelan, Zhu Youlan, Wang Yueqin, Zhu Shaoqing, Wang Shaojuan, Zhu Guiqing, Fu Yuexian, and Fang Shaoqing.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, the "Book Immortal Red Chamber List," compiled by Wu Xing Ji Renqiu Jushi, extensively introduces female ballad singers, containing twenty-four people. Fourteen of them also appear in the previous lists: Li Peilan, Chen Yuezhen, Li Qinxian, Yan Lizhen, Yang Yunqing, Yuan Yuexian, Zhu Sulan, Shen Yuechun, Yuan Xuelan, Zhu Xiangqing, Zhu Youqing, Zhu Fengjuan, Zhu Xiuqing, and Zhu Yuqing. The ten who do not appear are: Zhang Xuezhen, Wang Yueqin, Zhou Erbao, Zhu Shaoqing, Fu Yuexian, Zhu Wenqing, Zhou Aibao, Fu Shaoqin, Zhu Rongqing, and Zhu Youlan.</p>
<p>Xiangnan Ni Zhongxianzi also introduced fifteen female ballad singers in the "Shen Bao." The article is titled: "In the mid-summer of the Bingzi year, I came to Shanghai from Fujian for a short stay to recuperate. Every day, I borrowed musical scores from the library to pass the time. In just ten days, my illness disappeared, and I went to Suzhou. Later, I returned twice due to business, for a total of three months. There were many female historians, and I could not see them all. I will write a couplet for each of those I saw, which is exactly the number of the full moon in the third or fifth month." The fifteen people she mentioned were:</p>
<p>Zhu Sulan: With an elegant figure, she sings of white snow, like the fragrance of orchids leading the spring breeze.</p>
<p>Zhu Wenqing: Her literary talent and demeanor make her a leader, and her brilliant writing evokes images of fine robes.</p>
<p>Zhou Yueqing: The moon rises from the sea of clouds, and she is a celestial being banished from the moon palace.</p>
<p>Zhu Qinxian: Her heart resonates with Wenjun's intentions, and her immortal spirit knows no commoners.</p>
<p>Zhu Yuqing: She plays the flute to attract the phoenix, and I am ashamed to hear the singing of warblers.</p>
<p>Li Peilan: She wears sweet-smelling grass in autumn, and cultivates beautiful orchids in her garden.</p>
<p>Zhu Youlan: Her excellent and good words describe a young woman, and there are no better verses to give to Lanqing.</p>
<p>Zhu Xiuqing: Her elegance emerges from the midst of orchids, and she comes from the top of Penglai.</p>
<p>Wang Yueqin: Fill the ground with fragrance and invite the moon to get drunk, and listen to the qin as snowflakes fall from the sky.</p>
<p>Jiang Qinlan: Her fragrance is pure, like the waters of the Wusong River, and her elegance is like the fragrance of the Chu marshes.</p>
<p>Li Baoqing: It is true that this place has many treasures, and where else can we see fine writing?</p>
<p>Chen Yuee: The fading moon, the morning breeze, the willow banks, the azure goddess in a magnolia boat.</p>
<p>Yuan Yuexian: The bright moon and night pearls come endlessly, but practicing immortality and Buddhism is always difficult.</p>
<p>Chen Zhixiang: Her elegant garden is filled with falling flowers, and her fragrant carriages and treasure horses move along the Shanghai River.</p>
<p>This can be called the "Five Historians' Poems." The five historians refer to Yuan Yuexian, Zhu Sulan, Li Peilan, Zhu Xueqing, and Xu Baoyu. I have already quoted the poems about Sulan and Baoyu. The poem about Yuexian is: "Her youth is like water and her face is like a flower, a new song turns the moon's reflection, who believes that Flying Pearl is from a past life, it is a pity that her worth is mistaken for a pipa." The poem about Peilan says: "A slender figure suits her best, light makeup makes her fashionable, I fear that she will fly away in the wind, who can hold her in their palm?" The poem about Xueqing says: "She is naturally intelligent and charming, her eyes and eyebrows are difficult to describe. She does not know the hatred of the spring breeze, and scatters red teeth to brush purple silk," all these trivia are helpful in explaining the characters. The most extensive introduction is published in the fourth volume of "Huan Yu Suo Ji," which includes the surnames of female ballad singers in the "Description of Foreign Courtyard Writings," involving a total of fifty people: Jiang Qinlan, Fang Qiuchan, Chen Chaoyun, Zhou Aibao, Chen Daixiang, Fu Yueqing, Zhou Yueqing, Zhu Lanqing, Zhu Shaoqing, Zhu Rongqing, Zhu Wenqing, Lu Xiuqing, Zhu Suqing, Wang Yiqing, Wu Suqing, Zhu Xueqing, Zhu Yuqing, Wang Baoqing, Huang Aiqing, Jin Youqing, Fang Aiqing, Fang Shaoqing, Xu Peiqing, Huang Baoqing, Ye Xiuqing, Zhu Xiangqing, Zhu Fengjuan, Yu Fengzhen, Zhu Sulan, Zhu Youlan, Zhu Ruiyuan, Li Peilan, Yuan Yuexian, Fu Yuexian, Shen Yuechun, Yuan Xuelan, Yuan Yunxian, Wang Youjuan, Wang Shaojuan, Li Qinxian, Zhang Xuezhen, Chen Zhixiang, Chen Yuee, Chen Yuezhen, Chen Yuefang, Li Huifang, Wang Yueqin, Jin Sujuan, Jiang Yuee, and Jiang Yuejuan.

<h3>Dreaming of Wushan</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"The Shining Hour"</p>
<p>Produced by MGM, showing at the Nanjing Theatre</p>
<p>Frank Borzage is known for his elegant and understated style, but behind the elegance and understatement lies a rich and unstoppable emotion. In "No Greater Glory", Margaret Sullavan collapses on the stone steps; Robert Young is brought back from the carriage after being hit; Franchot Tone avenges his friend... all are vivid and touching. "Dreaming of Wushan" maintains his past style, but compared with "No Greater Glory", it inevitably appears loose. The reason is that he describes the relationships and conflicts of each character separately, and in the final scene of the new house being burned down, he hastily let go of the climax of Margaret Sullavan jumping into the fire. However, in this complicated story, he delicately and thoughtfully analyzes the emotional differences between brothers, sisters-in-law, brothers and sisters-in-law, and aunts and nephews, making people deeply feel that this peaceful family has been completely destroyed by the addition of the famous nightclub dancer from New York. For example, when Robert Young appears, he puts on an unhappy face to persuade his brother, but in the first, second, and third piano performances after returning home, his emotional shift to Joan Crawford is gradually accelerating—in the two scenes of horseback riding in the suburbs and embracing in the waterside pavilion, the writing from shallow to deep is very moving. Another example is Phillippe De Lacy's eldest sister, her stubborn nature, a kind of traditional female concept deeply holds her, from the first time she met Joan Crawford (she was unwilling to go to the airport to meet her), she discriminated against this woman who was incompatible with the whole family, but she can still endure, this endurance is exactly her appearance of "eldest sister like a mother", because of her love for her younger brother Melvyn Douglas. This continued until she discovered the obvious relationship between Joan Crawford and Robert Young, she quarreled with Melvyn Douglas (there is also a sympathy for Margaret Sullavan that is aroused here) and even set fire to the new house. So the looseness of the whole play is his shortcoming, but the description of the characters' personalities and their conflicts is his unique feature.</p>
<p>At the end, Melvyn Douglas leaves with Joan Crawford. Personally, it would be better to let Joan Crawford leave alone. Because Robert Young has already repented to Margaret Sullavan, and this famous dancer, who caused the whole family to be disturbed because of her own fault, her resolute departure is also leaving room for her repentance. Or it would be more dramatic.</p>
<p>Among the actors, I think Margaret Sullavan played the best role. When she knew that her husband was in love with Joan Crawford, she endured all the pain and offered her husband her kindness; when the fact was irreversible, she persuaded Joan Crawford and Robert Young to leave this family. Her hidden pain and her forced joy were moving. Robert Young and Joan Crawford, starting with suppression and then passionate abandon, can appropriately grasp the progress of the process, neither overdoing it nor falling short. Melvyn Douglas is competent only because of the role's decision. Phillippe De Lacy (the mother in "Maedchen in Uniform"), a kind of "eldest sister like a mother" character, is very stable.</p>

<h3>From "Fairies in Silks and Satins" to China's Song and Dance World</h3>
<p>— Xin Liang</p>
<p>"Fairies in Silks and Satins" is a song and dance film. Its release cannot help but make me think of the lack of Chinese song and dance films and the decline of song and dance in China.</p>
<p>There was a time when China's song and dance world was quite lively; especially when Li Jinhui founded the Mingyue Song and Dance Troupe, the troupe had the four great kings of the song and dance world—Wang Renmei, Li Lili, Xue Lingxian, and Hu Jia—at that time, almost no one in every corner of China did not know this song and dance troupe. At the same time, Li Jinhui's works, from the pitiful Qiu Xiang to the Seven Sisters Visiting the Garden, the Sparrow and the Child, the Three Butterflies, and the Little Painter, were all welcomed like crazy. In schools, most of the physical education and music curriculum homework included songs and dances and operas such as Three Butterflies—at this time, we can indeed call it the "Golden Age" of Chinese song and dance.</p>
<p>Later, the Mingyue Society was disbanded, and Wang Renmei, Li Lili and other good song and dance talents also turned to the film circle... Until today, China's song and dance world has simply become despondent. During this period, although the New Moon Opera Troupe and the Xinhua Opera Troupe appeared, and many song and dance talents were also created (such as Bai Hong, Zhou Xuan, Li Mingjian, etc., all of whom are very promising), the reputation and prestige of the past can never be regained after all.</p>
<p>Due to the decline of song and dance in China, Chinese song and dance films, of course, cannot be as numerous and great as those produced by Hollywood in the United States. In the past, Chinese song and dance films, such as Yuan Meiyun and Ma Loufen's "Human Fairies", Zhou Xuan's "Three Stars Accompany the Moon"... etc., compared with European and American song and dance films, can be said to be inferior in any aspect. Although we can say that it is because the capital and manpower are not as abundant as theirs, most of the reason is probably because the impression that song and dance gives to the general public is too bad.</p>
<p>In fact, except for the American-style obscene "nude dance", everything such as the classical school, the formalism school, and the newly emerging gymnastic song and dance drama are worthy of our praise and promotion. Song and dance, in a word, is the beginning of all literature and art. In primitive times, when human beings did not have language and writing, they already had song and dance. The purpose of song and dance is to stimulate emotions with "beautiful sound" and "beautiful form".</p>
<p>Pitiable! Noble and pure song and dance have been sacrificed by Chinese merchants. What four-strip dance, what midnight sneaky nude dance, what Yang Guifei bathing dance... all fill China's song and dance world with an atmosphere of eroticism and carnal desire, and the impression given to people, under this situation, how can it not be bad? However, have you seen "Poppy"? It is gratifying that a new type of progressive Chinese song and dance drama is opening up fresh buds. In the near future, this kind of modernized song and dance drama will often restore the "Golden Age" of China's song and dance world. Work hard! Every comrade who loves Chinese song and dance drama.</p>
<h3>Sonja Henie Returns Home in Glory</h3>
<p>— De Gang</p>
<p>She is the Fifth Glorious Woman of Norway The King Issues an Edict to Shut Down the Country for a Day to Celebrate</p>
<p>Skating Queen Sonja Henie recently starred in a blockbuster with Tyrone Power for 20th Century Fox, called "Winter Comes". Now that it has been completely filmed, she is avoiding it. She has now arrived in France, and after a brief stay, she will fly back to Norway, because the whole country of Norway, from the king to the common people, has been waiting with eyes wide open.</p>
<p>Sonja Henie has won more than 3,000 prizes since she started learning to skate at the age of seven. Whenever she won a victory, the King of Norway would personally send a telegram or present flowers to congratulate her. She is the number one citizen of Norway, and has the honorary title of knight specially bestowed by the king. The people regard her as a sacred female hero and include her as the fifth most glorious woman in the history of Norway. Therefore, statues of Sonja Henie often decorate parks or streets in Norway.</p>
<p>Now the King of Norway has issued a decree, ordering all government offices, schools, and factories to stop working for one day on the day Sonja Henie returns home to celebrate. It is expected that on this day, the whole country of Norway will be ecstatic, and the degree of excitement will probably be more intense than the National Day. Miss Sonja is also proud of it.</p>
<p>I have to add that Miss Sonja will have to wait until after September before she can return to Hollywood to film a new film and meet the audience again.</p>
<h3>Anecdotes from the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Hai Sheng</p>
<p>Liu Hanchen Resigns from Tianchan Liu Hanchen, the veteran actor of Tianchan Stage, resigned from the authorities the day before yesterday, preparing to leave after singing until the 23rd, and temporarily return to the north. The resignation was very firm. In the evening, Liu Xiaqing and Wang Kuiguan, the stage managers of the backstage, asked him to consider the small roles in the same class and asked him to sing until the 25th. Hanchen agreed immediately. For the time being, it can be peaceful, but how to solve the overall situation in the future has not been confirmed.</p>
<p>Zhao Ruquan's Return Date is Extended Zhao Ruquan, the new veteran actor of Gong Stage, was originally scheduled to leave Kunming for Shanghai on the 17th, but Zhao was retained by the local Xinsheng Theatre and could not get away. He probably will be able to leave around the 26th. The Gong Stage authorities are preparing to send a telegram to urge him to leave earlier. I don't know if he will be able to catch up with the opening after the summer break. As for the renewal of the stage to invite him, a certain celebrity is now mediating. Dong Yong has already given way to the other party.</p>
<p>An Anecdote about Yan Shaopeng Yan Jupeng's eldest son, Shaopeng, is an artist of the Ma Lianliang school. Yesterday, this newspaper talked about a very interesting anecdote about his learning the Ma school. A few years ago, he followed Jupeng to Nanjing to perform. At the farewell commemoration, he also made a cameo appearance on stage for three days. Needless to say, it was completely in the Ma style. Jupeng watched the play under the stage, and was so angry that he kept saying, "He is Ma Lianliang's son!" Once in Beijing, Yan Jupeng and Ma Lianliang performed Bai Mang Tai together during the day. Several friends who went to support Yan were pulled by Shaopeng to listen to Ma Lianliang, and said, "My father's play is nothing to listen to."</p>
<p>Zhang Yipeng Feasts Zhou Yibai Zhang Yipeng, the pillar of the Grand Stage, has been very close to people in the cultural world recently, which is quite helpful for his ideological, acting and character cultivation. Moreover, he reads with novelist Cheng Xiaoqing every afternoon. It is truly commendable to be able to work so hard. At 4 pm on the 24th, he will host a banquet for playwright Zhou Yibai at Henan Liangyuan to connect with feelings. Originally, Yipeng was scheduled to perform Ning Wuguan today, but because he had to rush to rehearse the new play "Thirty-Seven Chapters of Journey to the West", he had to change it and postpone it to the last two weeks of the new play. There are many people who want to reserve seats to watch this play. It is rumored that his change of play is because of the script problem, which is absolutely not true.</p>
<p>Gao Baisui Goes on Stage Ill Gao Baisui felt extremely frustrated since his buddy Lao Wang ran away. The day before yesterday evening, he didn't know what he ate, and his stomach suddenly ached strangely. He vomited all night without stopping. Yesterday morning, he even fainted on the chamber pot. Later, he went to the doctor for treatment, received an injection, and took a bottle of medicine. Only then did he recover slightly. The Carlton Theatre had a matinee in the afternoon, and he still went on stage ill, which is really dedicated.</p>
<h3>Unofficial History of the Pear Garden</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>Yan Jupeng's Popularity Reminds People of Guan Dayuan's Poverty</p>
<p>"Dayuan, whose courtesy name is Yuming, his father's name is Zilin, works as a martial Dan, and his childhood name is Zeng'er. The Liyuan industry all calls him Guan Zeng. When Dayuan was seven or eight years old, he studied Xusheng from the famous teacher Jia Lichuan. At that time, Jia was in his old age. His famous disciples included Xu Yintang, Li Xinpu, Zhang Rongkui, Gao Qingkui, and his nephew Hong Lin (childhood name Gou'er). After Lichuan's death, Dayuan also learned drama from Hong Lin. At that time, Hong Lin was enjoying a great reputation and was the most promising learner of Tan school. Hong Lin's wife was Dayuan's aunt. Since they were relatives, Hong Lin taught Dayuan everything he had learned. He was extremely intelligent. Whenever Lao Tan performed, he would often go to watch and imitate. Therefore, he could perform a lot of plays. He had a foundation in both civil and military, singing and acting, and even relying on his skills. Among the people who learned Tan, only Dayuan was a full talent besides Shuyan. Others such as Zhang Yuting, Gui Junqing, Wang Youchen, and Yan Jupeng were all amateurs who started halfway and entered the industry. They had no childhood skills, and their martial arts and relying on skills were not their strengths. Strictly speaking, they could not be called full talents."</p>
<p>Dayuan has such a good foundation. At this time when the talent of Xusheng is increasingly declining, logically speaking, he can enjoy a great reputation. Why is he still poor in the old capital? For more than ten years, no one in Shanghai has thought about bringing him to the south. There are several complicated reasons for this problem. First, he is too disciplined and does not know how to adapt to the times. Second, his height is slightly short, and his style and appearance are not as beautiful as Ma and Tan. Third, his voice is slightly off, and he has never recovered after choking. Fourth, his speech is too clumsy and he is not good at socializing. Fifth, since his split with Yanqiu, he has not been able to form a team due to lack of capital. For many years, he has only been a vassal of Danjiao, unable to give full play to his strengths. Therefore, he has not been paid much attention by the authorities of the foreign theaters, and his artistic name seems to have been gradually forgotten.</p>
<p>In addition to the above points, there is one thing that has delayed his future and he can never develop, that is, he respects his uncle Chen too much. Chen's Huqin can simply saw people to death. His fingers are not flexible, his mind is dull, and his posture is not elegant. He can be called the number one rotten Qin player in Beijing that no one will learn from. (65)</p>
<h3>Skating (92)</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Lian Junqi and Zhen</p>
<p>Four Sides (Continued)</p>
<p>Conclusion</p>
<p>Ordinary skating learners often want to learn various patterns and dance steps before they have fully learned the four sides. This is like a child wanting to jump and run while learning to walk. According to actual practice, if you can be proficient in the four sides and their four styles, and practice diligently, you will get twice the result with half the effort. Even when moving in a crowded field, you can not only avoid falling, but also have an extremely beautiful posture. Therefore, if you want to get the true fun of it, or want to study in depth, you must practice the four sides and the position of the four styles of each side.</p>
<p>The reason why advanced patterns are difficult to do is because skaters do not understand the various positions of the body before and after turning. If you practice it well when you first learn, you will be able to deal with it easily and get what you want.</p>
<p>Skating is one of the noble arts. It is difficult to reach the extreme without hard practice. Therefore, students who want to be proficient in this way must make up their minds, endure hardship, and practice diligently.</p>
<p>Everyone who plays billiards knows that after the ball is hit, the cue must follow behind the ball and must not stop moving forward or immediately shrink back after hitting the ball. The reason is that this "following movement" can make the direction of the ball accurate and the speed increase. It is the same with billiards and skating. After the foot is pushed, the hand should follow. All parts of the body should also follow and help after the foot is pushed, so the posture will be elegant and the speed will not decrease. This point is also something that skating learners must know.</p>
<p>There are often the following common problems when skating with four sides. Learners should pay attention to them at all times.</p>
<p>(1) Do not start from a standing position, that is, do not push hard at once, but first use the main foot to borrow strength.</p>
<p>(2) Do not use the entire side of the shoe to push, but use the toe, which makes the posture of the guest leg inelegant after pushing.</p>
<p>(3) The circle made is not round, and the guest is easy to become round. This is because the axis is not aligned when starting, and the main foot does not land on the applied side immediately when landing (that is, when entering from the outside, the main foot first lands on the inside edge. When retreating from the inside, the main foot first lands on the outside edge, etc.).</p>
<p>(4) When walking in and out, the body does not lean outward.</p>
<p>(5) Convex buttocks, that is, the buttocks are not under the shoulders, but protrude instead.</p>
<p>(6) Excessive movement of arms and legs, that is, the arms are raised too high and the legs are lifted too high.</p>
<p>(7) The head is lowered (note that you only need to look down with your eyeballs, do not lower your head.)</p>
<p>(8) Various other excessive movements, or the body is stiff and unnatural. To measure the level of the four sides and whether the foundation is solid, you only need to see how the learners perform in arc walking and various positions of the body. The test method is that each foot must draw circles three times with the four sides in a row. The position of each circle drawn and the vertical axis cannot be moved, and the size cannot be changed.</p>
