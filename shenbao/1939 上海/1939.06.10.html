<p>社評</p>
<h3>日軍操縱上海關的危機</h3>
<p>日前江海關額外稅務司發出通告，自六月一日起，，有江海口岸九處，各商輪如未得日陸海軍的許可，阻止結關行駛。據傳海關人員，業已開始執行這項命令；日來航行這九處口岸的各外商輪船，多已將行駛地點更改；英商太古公司萬通輪，因其行駛之地爲所列九處口岸中的海門啓束，已於申請結關時遭受海關的拒絕。日前，日海軍檢查英法郵船，當被各國政府視爲有意封鎖中國沿岸，即向日本提出抗議，日本曾聲稱對中國沿海一帶非中國輸船，並不禁航；現在事實所表現的、日本竟已變相的阻止外商輪船航行內河及沿海各口岸，這不是加緊封鎖是什麼？</p>
<p>日本利用海關阻止各外商輪船航行內河沿海各口岸，其主要的目的，尙還不祗在封鎖外商輪船的航行，破壞歐美在華現有的航業與商務；同時乃爲對於海關行政權，試其攫取的企圖。江海關爲中國淪陷海關之一，亦爲中國收入最大的海關，和歐美各國允具有極密切的關係；日本顧慮國際太嚴重的糾紛，故不把牠利其他海關一樣辦理。而於華軍西撒後，以和平談判的方法，在去年五月，和英國成立一項所謂英日海關協定；自此之後，江海關也成爲一個畸形的機關；表面上各有關係國家仍聲稱將保持中國海關行政主權的完整；但是實際上海關己不能完全執行中國政府的命令。這在英國方面的本意，本想以妥協的政策。保持她現實的利益；現在不僅是她的現實利益因日本拒絕償付外債而歸於消滅，並且日本還利用海關來破壞她在華的一切權利，這不是當初所意料的！</p>
<p>現在日本好像還不以江海關的現狀爲滿足、更企圖獲得全權操縱，這决額外稅務司的命令，就可視爲這種企圖的開始，所謂額外稅務司，原爲海關當局應付特殊環境而設；他的職權、應爲海關服務，而非執行日本陸海軍當局的命令；並且這個稅務司在江海關內的職位，是吾無須經過原來江海關的最高當局以及總稅務司的核准，而有權出通告、命令海關員司執行？這是根本疑問。如果額外稅務司并非江海關最高的行政當局，則實際上也就沒有發出這種通告的權力，無此職權而擅發通告，便是對於江海關行政權的破壞。</p>
<p>這决江海關額外稅務司的行動、和目前的遠東局勢自有相當的關係，允其是英國的遇事妥協，給予日本一個很大的鼓勵。此外海關人員不盡其應負的義務，也有一部分責任。額外稅務司發出的通告、爲甚麼海關最高當局事前不設法阻止？海關人員於接到通告後，爲甚麼不問正常的手續，而立卽執行？海關最高當局於發現這種通告後，爲甚麼又不命令撒消？這也是促使日本大膽行動的一個因素。建立所謂「東亞新秩序」，乃是日本的幌子，而現在正在繼續不斷地推行。對於江海關問題，假如這决封鎖九處口岸交通的行動，竟未引起各有關係國家的有效反抗，將來定必有類似事件相繼發生。現在可以利用海關未封鎭九處口岸，將來也就可以推演而封鎖其他各處口岸；大權在握，無事不可爲，祗要對於日本絕對有利，那顧甚麼歐美各國的對華貿易乃至其他利益。所以這决額外稅務司的行動，不過是企圖刼奪江海關整個行政主權的一個初步試探工作；現在有關各國在華的官商，正在籌商應付辦法。我們不僅希望能採取有效的抗議，迅即取銷這種禁律；同時更希望極力防止類似的非法行動繼續發生！</p>
<h3>日本各報恣意攻訐華租界「消除英國在遠東勢力不必顧及第三國權益」</h3>

<p>（倫敦）郭大使今晨訪晤英外相哈立法克斯作長談、曾告以今日續接中政府來電之內容、該電係訓令其對於引渡刺殺天津海關監督程錫侯之四嫌疑犯事再行提起抗議，目下此四嫌疑犯、雖尙未引渡於日方、惟中政府對此事件、似不完全認爲滿意、中國抗議之理由有二、　此舉將不啻承認北平日人卵翼下之政府、　將開危險之先例、郭氏今晨之訪問、一部份更屬社交性質、係介紹王正廷氏於英外相云、英當局所持之態度、認爲任何華人苟非確有觸犯刑事之證據、外國租界或居留地不能將其棄付於中國當局、（九日路透社電）</p>

<h3>英外相宣布　侵略時代已過去　如再發生必遇重大抵抗　英蘇談判尚有若干困難　德如悔禍仍願與之談判</h3>
<p>（倫敦）外相哈立法克斯勳爵今日在上院外交辯論中聲明、英政府之志願、係欲以帝國全部力量、從事於和平、並力言歐洲各國之獨立、可被片面行動破壞之時代、現已過去、有企圖作此項行動者、必將遭受廣大及堅決之抵抗云、外相又述及英政府與其他各國談判問題、謂政府方面、曾努力研究所接觸各國之特殊情形、並圖對於某項實際上之問題、作某種實際上之接洽、至於現在進行中之討論、恕不能以詳情奉告、關於波蘭、外相追述首相張伯倫商得波蘭外長柏克同意於四月六日所發之宣言、此宣言中所給予波蘭之保證、及相互性質、希望兩國間之永久條約不日可告成立、吾人所給予羅馬尼亞與希臘之保證、均屬片面方式、目下無需再加解釋、此項保證之運用、將如所給予波蘭者然、如羅馬尼亞或希臘之獨立、受顯明之威脅、羅國政府或希臘政府以為不得不用全國之力量以抵抗之、則英國將出面援助、關於土耳其、談判之第一階段已於五月十二日順利完成、英政府曾就當時所成立之妥協、發表宣言、現正積極從事宣言中所規定之繼續協商、余望不久可向下院宣佈此項協商之順利告竣、（眾歡呼）、土耳其在討論中所表示之友好合作態度、實令英政府及全國大為滿意、此誠地中海區域與東南歐和平之佳兆也、至對蘇聯、英政府已決議遣派外交部代表一員赴莫斯科、加　英蘇談判、最近數星期內、英政府所取之行動、堪為英國外交政策具有意義之出發點、關於一般大局、一言以蔽之、盡吾人之能力、以了解他國之意見、及使他國了解英國之意見、此節極關重要、而必須感覺者也、</p>
<p>墨索里尼言論可慰</p>
<p>外相次述及墨索里尼所發之演說曰、墨氏在都林所發之演說中、曾有數百萬人現方詢問吾人是否已處於趨向戰爭之大路、其實今並無問題足啟戰釁之言、余實不勝欣慰、惟此種問題如欲藉談判而獲解決、則必雙方具有好意、並準備容納他人之意見、且必雙方具有遵守對他人所發約言之信心而後可、</p>
<p>英不妨礙德國經濟</p>
<p>次述及德國曰、吾人在經濟場中、絕不願以妨碍德國為務、蓋知昌盛之德國、可使歐洲同沾其福也、英政府之唯一志願、及在用其全力以謀和平之解決、惟歐洲各國之獨立能為片面行動所破壞之時代、現在已成過去、有企圖作此項行動者、顯必遭受廣大與堅決之抵抗、假使承認各國之獨立、則英政府不特願意且切求開發整個經濟局面、此不僅對於德國如是、即對於歐洲其他各國、亦莫不如是也、</p>
<p>國際會議成否難定</p>
<p>關於召集國際會議以謀解決目前國際大局之可能性、此項會議之本身、無論其對於天然情感與衝動作何呼籲、能否有何補救、不無可疑、會議中所須考慮之事件、非全為德國之要求、凡與德國相對之要求、英國亦極盼能依保全永久和平之基礎加以調整、吾人頗見此類事件、能以談判解決、而不訴諸武力、蓋舍此而用他種條件、斷難使國際生活照常進行也、</p>
<p>戰爭難免未敢苟同</p>
<p>今人有抱戰爭不能避免之見解者、此實不敢輕予贊同、歐洲現在各種複雜問題、如魯莽滅裂以處置之、則極易促成戰爭、况今日更有數人、掌握使衝突益形尖說之全權、如爭端仍如前之相結、則無論戰爭之勝負誰屬、或戰爭之歷時幾久、余對於其最後結果、實毫不為之懷疑也、夫抵抗乃勢所必至、戰爭之必有可怖後果、為眾所知、而各國民眾傾向和平之意旨、與其願見一切爭端、悉用談判方法、以獲解決之準備、宜為眾所共曉、當此之時、彼冀訴諸武力、以圖一逞者、苟一度了然於對方之信義、而猶不覺以談判方法、解決在調整要求與適應新環境的需要時、所不可免之困難、為非更賢明而更有利益之辦法、則余殊難置信也、</p>
<p>對蘇談判尚有困難</p>
<p>哈氏於演說之初、宣稱、關於吾人與蘇聯之結合、余曾在巴黎及日内瓦兩地與法國各閣員互作討論、並與蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基連續晤談、結果、乃向蘇聯政府提出英法之提議、依吾人之意見、此項提議、已在實質上適應前發生困難之各點、惟有一二困難、尚待解決、關於波羅的海各國之地位、吾人從未企圖强以担保加諸不願接受担保之各國、或採取可在他方面妨害對此數國的關係之任何步驟、吾人之唯一志願、在維持彼等中立、不遭侵犯而已、同時、吾人有必須承認者、自蘇聯本身安全觀點而論、蘇聯對於其各鄰邦之獨立、自不能無所關切、余希望終可覓取方法、以解決此項困難、及或將發生之其他問題、</p>
<p>英國政策耿直坦白</p>
<p>外相又對於一般局勢發表言論如下、英國政策、在吾人視之、耿直而坦白、但在德國許多富於思想的人民視之、則感想或與之不同、此殆不難想像而知者、余之對於猶太人所遭之待遇、深為震驚。不亞於吾人者、實繁有徒、無論德國對於慕尼黑會議後之德捷關係、具何感想、余知對於摧毀捷克獨立、以圖解決此問題之舉動、認為既屬不智且亦謬誤者、亦不乏其人、但余心目中德人之有此感想者、或鑒於戰後若干年之歷史而亦覺除非準備武力威脅為後盾、則德人所認為合理與正當之要求、將永不得他國考慮、其實英國人民常欲於其認為可能時、與德國獲得不特可有裨於解決特殊問題、且可置兩國於互信的安全立塲之諒解、雖在今日、余想英國人民猶抱此望焉、同時余想應予闡明者、英國人民正不遜海峡以外之友人、亦同樣準備與決計作一切必要之供獻、以維護其生活之道、而保衛其在世界上之地位、</p>
<p>各處門戶依然開放</p>
<p>啥氏繼言及反侵略保證、與德國所稱之「包圍」者、謂各國之領袖、果皆不抱藉優勢武力的壓迫强行解決之企圖、則反侵略擔保、決不致付諸實施、今通至可使各方受益的新機會之途徑、依然開放、在此隉杌不定的世界中、如有一事確切不移者、即英法決不對任何他國之獨立與安全、作侵略之行動、或間接方法之攻擊是已云、斯尼爾勳爵、發動外交事件之辯論謂、政府為時局所驅迫、已最後接受集體安全之主要原則、惟英蘇協定之遲遲未獲成立、至少有擾亂不定之影響、遠東局勢、尤不能使人滿意、渠不欲抨擊外相、但外相之答詞、對於中國大使顧維鈞在日內瓦所發之籲請而發者、實屬擾人的缺少同情云、哈立法克斯在答詞中、謂渠料西班牙外籍軍隊、不久皆可撤退云（八日路透電）</p>
<p>英德誤會仍可解除</p>
<p>德國民族似以為英國已不願與德國樹立諒解、惟此誤會、形成歐洲時局之危險因素、實則英國民族、已往力求根據互信之心、與德國成立諒解、今茲猶然、即如歐戰期間與戰事結束之後、發見種種謬誤之處、英國亦願自任其咎、且以為理應糾正者、亟願予以糾正、庶與德國民族樹立友誼之新紀元」、前當一九三六年三月初間、德國廢止羅卡諾公約之後、該國當局即曾聲明、各種出人意外舉動之時期、業已過去、又於一九三八年三月間、德奥合併之後、聲明在歐洲方面無復領土之要求，降至去歲九月間、慕尼黑協定簽字成立、為蘇台德問題覓獲解決方案、英德兩國並於九月三十日發表共同宣言、揭橥和平意願、當是時也、英國民族間、雖不無焦慮、復覺德國之見解、英國從未能接受，要亦力求予以了解惜乎相隔未久、德國猶太人即受虐待、全世界人士良知為之衝動、未幾德國又以迅雷不及掩耳之手段、出兵佔據捷克國、摧毀其獨立、多數人士慄慄危懼、愈謂此事或即武力稱覇歐洲之初步辦法、多数國家懾於此種潛伏的危機、互相接近、此固情理之常也、」（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>鴉片公賣</p>
<p>僞省方設禁烟總局、各縣設禁烟分局、名爲禁烟、實則公賣、各縣禁烟分局、由僞縣公署或僞警察所兼辦、杭市縣禁烟、則由僞總局辦理、各項公賣費收入、均按省縣分配、其詳情如下、（甲）烟民申請登記費、每張申請書收費一角、（乙）烟民執照費、每季一元五角、（上項申請書及執照費、在總局爲省收入、在分局爲各縣收入、）（丙）鴉片印花稅、總局設鴉片（僞方稱戒烟藥品）製造所及專賣所、除收取規定烟價外、鴉片每兩征收印花費三元、印花由總局製發、印花費收入、以三分之二爲省收入、三分之一爲市縣收入、（丁）鴉片配發所牌照憑證捐、省縣禁烟局所在地、特許設立鴉片配發所及售療所、每配發所至少每月應認銷鴉片一千兩、按月繳納牌照憑證捐一百元、多則類推、（即按認銷數征收牌照憑證捐百分之十、）（戊）鴉片售療所營業牌照捐、每所每月應分等繳納營業牌照捐、捐額最高爲二十元、（上兩項牌照憑證捐、在總局爲省收入在分局爲縣收入、）（已）私貨拍賣及罰金收入、緝獲之私土私烟膏、變價所得、及經判處罰金而繳納者、除補助審判機關公費及提成充賞外、其餘爲市縣牧入、</p>
<p>田賦及地價稅</p>
<p>僞縣公署編征田賦、各縣情形不同、惟大都按畝征收、因日僞所佔僅及城鎭、四鄕均在游擊隊掌握之中、偽方不敢派人下鄉催征、故各縣僞縣公署田賦收入甚少、杭市僞市政府、已於四月十六日起、籌備開征二十八年度上期地價稅、</p>
<p>空屋放租</p>
<p>日方佔據各市鎭、人民多數逃亡在外、日偽異想天開乃舉辦空屋登記、實行空房放租、杭市規定自三月一日起至四月三十日爲空屋登記期、自五月一日起、實行空屋放租、據偽杭州市府編查現存房屋結果如决　店屋八五〇戶、　住屋五·五五一戶、　空屋三·八一五間、共一〇。一二五戶、是空屋遠在店住屋戶數之一、空屋放租收入、必大有可觀、計空屋放租、可得三種收入、一。空屋登記費、每戶五角、二。承租空屋申請費、每張申請書收費二元、三·租金、由店住屋估計委員會、估定租額、按月繳納、並須於入屋時、預付租金一月、</p>

<h3>法幣未搖動外匯市塲漸寗靜凡正當需要餓照常供給俟獲新水準卽繼續管制</h3>
<p>（本報香港九日專電）今晨港法幣價格回漲至四八、一般視察者稱、有回漲至五零可能、金融界息、華政府對法幣跌價、已有妥善應付辦法、權威方面發表稱、過去數週間、中國法幣平衡基金、未有困難、法幣亦未搖動、但日前暫行停止管制、俾大洋兌滙價値獲得一更適應之經濟水準、由此以平衡貿易、去年六月時、亦曾採同一措施、其時水準價爲八便士、而此價維持成功至一年之久、現新水準已發現、並能穩固的支持、可爲深信、英商滙豐等銀行限制供給黑市塲外滙後、惟對於各業正當需要、憑定貨單仍儘量供給、旨在杜絕投機者之操縱滙市、及日人之套買外滙、同時中央銀行對於法定外滙、亦照舊供給、因此昨日起上海市塲人心安定、謠言已息、外匯價格、亦稍穩定、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>外滙申請照常辦理</p>
<p>外商銀行凡經營外滙者、如滙豐·麥加利·花旗·大英·等行、對於正當商人購買外滙、憑定貨單照舊供給、旨在杜絕投機家操縱匯市、及日人無法套買外滙、至於中央銀行討於凡經政府特准進口之貨、仍予供給一先令二便士半之法定外滙、上海中央銀行分行、每星期仍照常辦理外滙請核事宜、咋日爲星期五、爲該行核准發表之日、惟因審查甚爲嚴格、所以核准之數甚少、</p>
<p>眞相已明人心大定</p>
<p>上海黑市塲之外滙行市、自本月七日起空前緊縮後、市塲謠言甚多、投機家乘機操縱圖利、今限制供給外滙眞相已明、證實謠言之無稽、而中國外滙基金依然豐富、足能維持抗戰時期之外滙、同時外滙平準委員會已說明謠言之不可靠、因此昨日起市塲人心已安、謠言平息、外滙價格、亦稍穩定、昨日滙豐銀行之掛牌英滙六便士半、美滙十二元六角二分半、與前日掛脾相同、</p>
<p>相當時期恢復供給</p>
<p>昨據銀行界消息、香港外滙平準基金委員會、對於上海黑市塲外匯之暴縮、會於本月七日開委員會硏究之、聞此决之暫時停止援助黑市塲外滙、爲防止日人之套買、及促成貿易之平衡、使上海關之入超减少、一俟滙價至水平綫、即行恢復供給維持、即如有人拋出時、則該會買進、如有收進時、該會賣出、務使黑市外滙穩定、上之處置、與中國戰時金融有益、</p>
<p>進口商人集議補救</p>
<p>黑市塲外匯之暴縮、影響進口商營業前途、殊匪淺鮮、允以進口商已訂之貨、而未購買外滙者、其損失甚大、昨日起、滙市雖已稍見穩定、但與七日以前比較、低落一便士半、此後是吾能恢復七日以前狀態、目前無法預測、所以進口商某重要之洋行、昨日曾經一度非正式之集議、商討補救目前匯市緊縮辦法、聞一致希望中國政府迅予維持、而免進口商遭意外之損失、</p>
<p>確實比例未至水準</p>
<p>英文大美晚報云、本埠匯兌市塲之披動、今（九日）晨已歸寗靜、迄至午刻、平準基金仍未經匯豐與麥加利兩銀行確復出售外匯、因目前匯兌之確實比率、尙未跌至基金所定之新水準也、但上述兩銀行已向顧客與其他銀行暗示、基金似將於英匯縮至六便士五、美匯至十二元六二五時、出售外匯、爲間收盤時、兩種匯率仍較新水準高零六二力基金有重新干涉而出售外匯之象、市塲復得保證、許多買方亦停止或减少其匯兌之申請、屆時對基金之外匯分配、將吾加以限制、留俟是時覘之、中國政府對於此方面尙無確切表示、今晨日元在本埠匯市較强、兌換店以九角九分五買進、而以一元〇五分售出、</p>

<p>銀行及其委託之中國·交通·兩銀行付款後、新　　　　昨向國僓基金管理委員會探悉、統一公債甲乙丙丁債票、抽籖業已分別舉行、至於戊種債票、準今日上午十時、在銀行公會舉行計抽籤八支、還本二百零八萬元、已函請上海市商會·銀錢業公會、地方法院·等屆時派員監視、</p>

<h3>工部局調查美文工潮擬施行調解免糾紛擴大</h3>
<p>本市小沙波路美文織綢廠、共有男女工人三百餘人、勞資感情、向稱融洽、最近廠方因營業淸淡、突於本月七日上午宣告開除工人一百餘名、並關閉廠門、阻止工人進廠工作、全體工人聞訊、羣情恐慌、當向廠方請願、要求准予復工、但無結果、該工人等乃假某處集商、經推出代表五人、於八日下午二時、赴工部局請願、要求秉公援助、當由工業科主仟接見、工方代表首先陳述被開除經過、並提二項要求、（一）恢復被開除工人工作、（二）停工期內、由廠方給予津貼、工部局允查明核辦、昨晨、局方即派顧炳臣至該廠調查、聞將召集雙方施行調解、以免事態擴大、影響治安、</p>
<h3>銅幣被搜羅殆盡國府决擬發行銅輔幣劵奸商搜集售與某方中央銀行中止接濟商民零用暫感不便</h3>
<p>財政部鑒於海外銅價飛漲、奸商牟利、私運銅元出口、茲爲保存幣材及兵工材料起見、曾經令飭海關、飭屬嚴密查緝在案、復因奸商受人利用收買銅元、供給某方爲兵工材料、不獨擾亂金融、破壞幣政、其叛國行爲、影響抗戰允大、若不嚴予懲治、實不足懲奸頑而資懾服、故特規定凡奸商收買一分半分銅幣及舊銅兀者、經查獲確係轉售與人、或偷運出口者、除全數予以沒收充公外、並依照懲治奸宄條例、以擾亂金融治罪、自實行之後、銅元之私運出口絕跡、惟上海一埠、因地屬淪陷、在特殊情形之下、爲政府權力所不及、江海關被迫環境亦無法執行命令、一般奸商、乃利用環境、鉅額搜集、售與某方、由虹口裝輪出口、爲時已久、數目驚人、以致市塲上一分半分銅幣及舊銅兀、搜羅殆盡、同時中央銀行鑒於此種情形、中止將新輔幣運滬接濟、各業受好商收買之影響、一切交易、殊感不便、不得已以郵票及印花代巷銅幣流通、公共汽車將前發之代銅元之幣、重行發出流通、各電車希望乘客隨帶銅幣乘車購票、至於路上之乞丐、亦受銅元缺乏影響、聞錢業銅元掛牌、雖爲銅元三百枚銅幣一百枚、但實際行市、則爲銅元二千五百文、輔幣九十五枚、</p>
<p>折換不易</p>
<p>據大通社記者、昨日在市上所得之印象、曾有人以一角輔幣劵、向紙烟店折換銅輔幣七分、亦有以國幣一元、易取銅幣二百七十枚者、以無銅輔幣缺乏爲言、而拒絕主客之折換者、則允比比然也、其他在菜市塲方面所見、大致須購物在五分以上、始能獲找銅輔幣、商店亦然、</p>
<p>安步當車</p>
<p>電車公言、亦以銅輔幣缺乏、故對乘客未帶銅輔幣者、賣票人即婉言拒其登車、乘客在此種狀况下、祗得安步當車、惟路程迢遠、及不慣於步行者、則殊以爲苦、公共汽車則將以前代價籌碼出而行用、故尙能應付、</p>
<p>市塲所見</p>
<p>因上項情形、市民所感受之不便與痛苦殊甚、多數商店、乃將郵票作爲替代品、以應付顧客、亦有自印一種代價券、以代替一角以下之籌碼行用者、惟多數商店、則於尾找問題、仍無法解決、營業亦隨之蒙受相當影響、允以一般小販爲甚、而乞丐因無人佈施、其打擊更甚也、</p>
<p>將發新劵</p>
<p>最後據大通社記者探悉、政府決發行一分二分五分三種輔幣券、以應滬上需耍、查浙東各地、亦因銅輔幣之缺乏、早由浙江地方銀行、發行一分二分五分三種輔幣券、以應市塲需要、故此舉並不困難、外傳發銅元券說、則並不確實、</p>

<p>强迫工人參加游行</p>
<p>偽「大民盟會」·等、爲某方獻媚、誇示功績起見、曾數度利誘綸昌工友、舉行遊行示威、一般工友、深明大義、多拒絕參加、僅少數無知女工、受其驅使、詛前日下午一時許、偽方又强迫無知工人、再度遊行、當由東昌路出發、向東經新馬路·賴義渡·楊家渡·再返東昌路、沿途並散發荒謬傳單、偽警均爲協助、遇有工友不願遊行而臨時退出者、則强予阻止、故遊行時各工友之神態、均極勉强、</p>

<p>日總領事三浦、直接提出口頭交涉、反對日方在浦東助長反英騷動、斐氏言及日軍之贊同勞工反英騷動、及昨日侵晨浦東白蓮涇綸昌印花廠發生之事件、謂白蓮涇印花廠之罷工、雖已解決、持械便衣日人竟阻撓英方僱用之華工、不得返廠、繼請三浦採取爲防杜日人重作</p>
<p>此種活動</p>
<p>所必要之步驟、據咋日較早消息稱、便衣日人曾開槍、力阻工人復工、並有旁觀一華人受傷而送入南市醫院、日方昨晚招待記者席上未提及斐利溥訪晤三浦事、惟日海軍發言人稱、綸昌印花廠前並無開槍情事、「日當局刻正廣事戒備、以維持該地之和平與秩序」云、關於昨晨有日兵參加之</p>
<p>反英游行事、渠無消息、或詢近數週來、根本有無反英性質之示威游行、發言人答罷工工人或有示威游行、但此事渠亦無消息、有詢日當局會有所行動、以防杜罷工工人作示威游行吾、發言人答、如以前所言、日軍並不在勞資間調停、僅維持和平與秩序耳、字林報云、浦東陸家嘴綸昌紡織廠監工英人丁格勒、星期二日晨在廠中與日水兵搏鬥、身受重傷、至星期三日晨身死、昨（八日）晚據</p>

<h3>外匯緊縮　影響滬市各業　煤塊昨起漲價來源趨稀　洋米運滬勢必提高售價</h3>

<p>煤塊漲價</p>
<p>煤業市塲因受外滙緊縮影響、買賣價格相差較遠、並水脚高昂、已訂煤塊一旦運滬應銷、勢必受損非淺、並市塲人心看高、皆抱默觀態度、暫不出棧、故現貨稀少、該市塲評價委員會即於日昨召開會　、議決結果、　印度塊煤每噸四十三元、　開平煤每噸四十一元、　鴻基煤每噸四十八元、　開平屑每噸頭號三十六元五角、二號二十八元、以上各項售價、皆係市塲同行買賣、至於煤</p>

<p>影響洋米</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向某米　領袖探悉、因外滙緊縮、國內外物品售價、均已相差甚巨、本市一部份米商爲未雨綢繆計、雖已委託達孚洋行代爲訂購西貢洋米二十萬包、（的二千噸）其價格每大包爲十九元四角、惟自外匯緊縮後、並因水脚高昂、屆時洋米售價勢將提高、影響民食、誠匪淺鮮也、至於第二批洋米尙未成交、現因外滙關係、暫停電洽、</p>

<h3>來源日湧　業價回跌　訂購洋米已非必要　外匯暴縮無甚關係</h3>
<p>前日因匯價暴縮、致有洋米續訂不易及囤戶乘機吸收等說、而又告上漲、滙價緊縮、訂購洋米大不合算、故將來洋米之續訂爲難、確爲事實、惟近來滬地存米充足、產區來源頗暢、如昨日河下到貨五六船、火車小輪船運到蘇州無錫崑山等處食米有五千包以上、且天氣炎熱、囤戶深恐存米發熱受損、均大都出籠、市塲交易頓呈供過於求之象、故米價已轉跌、常熟白粳已回跌至十七元三角、照目前存到俱裕之情形而論、訂購洋米、實非必要、外匯雖緊、對於米價、實無重大關係、滬市民食、決無他虞、</p>
<h3>汪精衛將東渡　陳璧君高宗武及日人同行　將與日商組偽「中央政府」</h3>
<p>在精衛業由國府明令通緝、惟在之行踪、異常詭秘、故數月以來、言人人殊、茲據可靠報告、在實於上月初旬蒞滬、從未他往、蓋已逾一月矣、爰將所得消息、分紀如决、</p>
<p>汪之住所</p>
<p>汪抵滬之初、以江灣土肥原之住宅爲寓所、由日方特別保護、其後、遷回滬西安和寺路之故居、在之故居、與孫科。吳鐵城。王伯羣·等之大厦、同在越界築路範圍內、孫吳王等之住宅、均早遭日方佔踞、惟注宅獨得無恙、可見在與日方默契、由來已久、在宅圍墻、加高建築、以資防衛、其外圍四週、三十碼以內、不許行人通過、並分別設立木屋崗位多座、由衛隊分班守衛、內圍除日憲兵一隊外、另有在之隨身衛隊等、計內外圍衛隊共的一百五十名、每名薪水由三十五元至一百二十元、保護極爲森嚴、汪常往還江灣滬西兩處寓所、每出以汽車四輛、分佈前後、大抵在與日方人員及南北兩僞組織之傀儡等有所接洽、輒在江灣、若與其親信及其他各方面接洽、則在滬西、隨汪同來滬者、爲在妻陳璧君及陳壁君之姪陳春圃、陳原爲僑務委員會委昌兼敎育處長、以附從汪故、早被中央予以免職、此决隨汪來滬、固爲秉承陳璧君之意旨、而其職責、則專爲辦理情報、而以華方種種重要消息、供給日方、其所得日方酬報、每月爲五萬元、</p>
<p>撮合人物</p>
<p>汪此决與日接治、從中拉綫者、日本方面、爲土肥原·原野影佐·等、以土肥原等當在僑居東京時、已相與認識、友誼甚深也、愧儡方面、爲陳羣·陳中孚·等、陳等在傀儡羣中、尚以國民黨員自詡、與在則有黨誼也、汪系方面、爲高宗武。周佛海·等、此外則德國方面、亦從中爲在日兩者撮合、在之親信陳公博輩、本非絕對同情在之行動、但陳向持親德論、故因德國方面之煽動、遂亦不待異議、外傳陳脫離在關係者、乃陳自放之烟幕也、</p>
<p>行將東渡</p>
<p>汪在滬月餘、原野等日夕追隨其左右、而在所與晤談者、除日方要員外、有王克敏。梁鴻志·溫宗堯·陳羣等、聞係交換組織僞「中央政府」意見及朋分南北各方面之僞政權、其重要問題、則以溫宗堯陳羣二人於四月中旬東渡請示所議定者爲基礎、緣日方早巳計劃由南北兩偽政府、組織僞『聯邦中央政府、』預擬以吳佩孚或在精衛爲偽領袖、但日方之同情吳者、以吳爲中國著名軍人、又非國民黨員、可以提挈大部份軍民、同時則以在之主張恢復國民政府的組織及仍用國民黨所定黨國旗幟、殊非適宜、至日方之同情在者、則誤認在在國民政府及國民黨、原爲高官大員、具有相當的號召能力、惟對於仍用黨國旗幟一項、則勸在略予變通、日方對吳對在之同情者、持論旣不盡同、因而有於四月間召溫陳二人東渡就商之舉、蓋以溫爲吳較尊重之人、溫每對日方表示、謂就彼與吳之私交而論、可以拉吳登臺、是溫可爲吳之代表、陳羣旣爲汪日勾結拉綫人之一、汪未抵滬前、汪日兩方意見、陳每爲之轉達、故日方又隱認陳爲在之代表也、迨溫陳於四月下旬返南京後、在旋即抵滬、汪與溫陳等遂一再交換意見、對於組織僞』聯邦中央政府」、汪溫等皆期其早成、但汪以爲仍須親與日政府接洽、故決定日內東渡、隨行者爲陳璧君·陳春圃·高宗武。及日人原野等、前傳在於本月二日由日返滬者、實屬不確、</p>

<h3>中國職業敎育槪况　積極訓綀職敎師資　舉行展覽互相觀摩</h3>
<p>師資檢修</p>
<p>自中等學校設置及經費支配標準辦法頒後、各地中學敎育之畸形發展、漸决矯正、職業學校日見增設、需要優良職業師資極爲殷切、二十二年十月、敎部頒布各省市職業學校職業學科師資登記檢定及訓練辦法大綱、登記辦法分兩種、一爲凡高級職業學校甲種實業學校、或高級中學農工商科畢業後、具有二年以上之經騐者、或職業界中級技術人員、繼續任職四年以上者、得請求登記、充做初級職業學校及職業補習學校職業學科師資、二爲凡國內外專科以上學校畢業後、具有二年以上之職業經騐者、或職業界高級技術人員、繼續任職叫年以上者、得請求登記、充作高級職業學校職業學科師資、各省市如缺乏前項登記師資人員、而有擅長技術之匠師、志願當高級或初級職業學校職菜技術學科師資者、應就其技術種類程度、分別予以撿定、各省市如對前項之人員均告缺乏時、應委託具有成績之專科以上學校分別訓練之、其訓練辦法、高級職業學校師資、招收高級中學程度相當學校畢業生、予以三年至四年之訓練、或招收高級職業學校相當程度學校畢業生、對於原習學科爲繼續之研究者、予以三年之訓練初級職業學校師資、招收初級中學程度相常學校畢業生、予以三年之訓練、或招收初級職業學校程度相當學校畢業生、對於原習學科爲繼續之研究者、予以一年至二年之訓練、其應訓練之科目、亦經分別規定、</p>

<h3>敎科書審委姜季辛談　中學歷史敎科書缺點　關於民族及文化方面有共同缺點</h3>
<p>（重慶通訊）敎育部中學敎科書編輯兼敎科書審查委員姜季辛氏、最近於審閱各大書局所出版之中學歷史敎科書後、摘出其缺點甚多、茲摘誌要點如下、</p>
<p>詳審五種　略審四種</p>
<p>此次審閱之中學歷史敎科書、計有呂思勉編高中本國史、（商務）屆心人編初中外國史、（世界）陳祖源編初中外國史、（正中）余遜編高中本國史、（世界）李季谷編初中外國史、（世界）等五種、而金兆梓之高中本國史、（中華）耿淡如王宗武合編之高中外國史、（正中）何炳松之高中外國史、（商務）李淸悚蔣恭晟合編之初中本國史（大東）等書、亦曾略爲審閱、感覺一般高中歷史敎科書、比初中稍好、至於所感到諸書中之缺點、的有數點如後、</p>
<p>民族起源　謬論未除</p>
<p>關於中華民族的起源、多數的歷史敎科書、都根據已經發見的地下只料、力言中華民族自古即生活於這一片錦　河山的中國、並非由他處遷移而來、明白吾認了外人始倡的「東來說」或西來說」等謬論、這是近年來歷史敎科書上的一大進步、但是、還有此歷史敎科書中、對於中華民族的起源、依然含糊其詞、不說「異說紛紜一「莫衷一是以有存疑」（呂思勉余遜兩氏均如此）便公然仍舊主張「西來說」、）趙心人的初中外國史上冊六十七頁有此論調）這一類的說法、不僅使國人不能明瞭祖先的來源、而且間接足以動搖國民對於保衛領土、愛護祖國」的決心、這是我閱讀中學歷史敎科書所最先感到的一種缺點、</p>
<p>民族界限　劃分過嚴</p>
<p>其决如歷史敎科書、還有許多編者、依然脫不了狹隘的舊觀念、將各族的界劃分得太嚴、顯然未循着中華民族演進的軌道而主動、並與三民主義之民族主義的旨趣相背、例如、歷史上各族在語言血統、衣冠以及生活習慣等方面的混合或同化的事實、原是促進各族團結融合的良好資料、理當充分發揮、使國人明白了解、各族的瓦相融合、巳非一朝一夕、但是有些敎科書中、對於漢人之衣胡服、用胡語，或胡人之易漢姓、從漢族、輒加非難、關於這一點以呂思勉氏的高中本國史爲最甚、呂氏書中且常以「異族」「外族」等名詞稱邊疆各族、以與「中國」相對稱、故意嚴劃國內各族的界限、殆否認邊疆民族爲巾國人、此外有些敎科書中、於字句間應用「中國人」之處、却往往使用「漢人」或「漢民族」字樣、這完全像外國人的筆調、允其是「漢民族」三字、明明是倭人特意用以「分化中國人」的怪名詞之一、而公然有些敎科書中、盲目的採用、未免令人大感莫解、</p>
<p>上古文化　敘述簡略</p>
<p>在本國史裏面、關於「上古文化」的叙述、原極重要、因爲宣揚先民在文化上的功績、足以增强今人的民族意識、激發今人的愛國精神、所以一些進化甚近、絕無古代文化可言的國家、不惜杜撰歷史、妄稱其祖先在文化上有何成就、藉以激勵其人民、但是我所看到的幾部高中本國史敎科書、對於我國上古文化的叙述、都極簡略、無條理、甚至關於歷數樂律、醫藥等方面的發明創造、多未提及、而「對春秋戰國時諸子百家的哲學思想、記述頗詳於當時工藝醫術的發達、却一字不提」更是各書的通病、</p>
<p>對外影響　尤少闡揚</p>
<p>其次、中華文化在世界上的地位和對於其他國家的影響、無論本國史或外國史敎科書中均應明白叙出，以證明我國文化實有無上的價值、爲一些號稱一等强國者所不及、例如日本以及東亞其他民族的典章制度、語言·文字·學術·技藝·姓氏·衣冠·以及生活·習慣、什九都是摹仿我國、但各極歷史敎科書中、叙述我國文化對外國的影響、只略述三大發明、（五大發明）的西傳及目人於隋唐時代會來華留學、至於我國學術思想在他國歷史演進中的地位如何、日木明治維新所受我國之厚惠如何、尚目不見提及、其他一切一切、不用說、都不在那些敎科書編者的意下了、</p>
<h3>關心學校　學生擁擠問題　尙有十餘校米解决</h3>
<p>上海租界區域自國軍西撤後、處境迄今尚稱安全、因之內地戰區人民多逃避來滬、其中大中小學生佔數頗屬不少、因學生之增多、新設立之各級學校、遂加雨後春筍、但以房租昂貴、校舍大都狹隘、以致無不超過原有數額、發生難解之擁擠問題、工部局學務處因管轄所屬各學校學生擁擠、對於學業與衛生兩有妨礙、曾函飭各校如遇有學舍不敷應用、可即時設法尋覓寬大之校舍遷移開學、茲肥者頃向學務處方面探詢、迄目前止已覓有寬大房屋遷移校止者僅有十餘校、尚有十餘校因空屋難覓、以致擁擠問題、難以解決、但學務處仍在督促遵照迅速辦理、以重學業云、</p>
<h3>學校彙訊</h3>
<p>滬大暑期學校　滬江大學早有暑期學校之創設、規劃周詳、成績斐然、本夏暑校已籌備就緒、所開各課、均切合實際需要、上課時間、爲每日上午八時至十一時、預定七月四日註册繳費、</p>

<h3>上海至星加坡</h3>
<p>— 元</p>
<p>新嘉坡在英屬馬來半島南端之小島上，有堤岸和大陸接連，因其地位處於歐亞航路的要衝，復經英人的積極經營，已成爲重要的商業中心，貿易繁盛，甲於南洋各地。輸出以錫爲大宗，米樹膠香料等决之。全埠人口五十餘萬，其中華人占十之七八，近年以來國人之前往該埠貿易者，更見增加。但以初决前往，旅行上一切事宜，容有不甚明瞭之處，爰將首途前應辦手續，航行於申星兩埠問之航輪以及各輪各級價目等作一簡略的介紹，以供初决前往者的參考和選擇。</p>
<p>請領護照　首途之前，須先請領出國護照，其手續爲塡寫申請書一紙，（申請書之保證人一項，須由商舖及其經理蓋章。）並備三寸照相五張，向外交部領取。護照費十二元，如委託中國旅行社代辦亦可，惟需時三星期之久。</p>
<p>英領簽字　護照領得後，至英國領事署塡寫申請害二紙，並呈騐由目的地寄來之證明文件、然後由該署將申請書寄往所往地官廳調查。該官廳調查後，據實報告此間領署，如認爲合格，方允簽發護照。計簽字費英金十叫先令六便士。</p>
<p>醫生證書　在選購船票之前，須至醫生處種牛痘，及注射防疫針，並向醫生索取證書，否則船公司不允購票登輪。（如乘三叫等艙位，則醫生證書須工部局所發者，方爲有效。）</p>
<p>護照簽宇，及醫生證書等辦妥後，即可選購船票。查上海至星加坡，所有意郵·法郵·大英·北德·藍烟囱等公司均有船行駛。茲將各公司各輪船及各級票價列下：</p>
<p>（甲）意國郵船公司有「康梯浮地」，「康梯羅梭」，「康梯卑安克馬諾」，及「維多利亞」輪。票價：頭等英金二十鎊，二等十四鎊，經濟二等十鎊。行程七日。</p>
<p>（乙）法國郵船公司有「阿拉米司，「阿島司第二」，「霞飛元帥，「杜美總統」，「琴拉寶」，「鎭怒沙」，「佛力士羅梭」等掄。票價：頭等英金二十鎊，二等十五鎊，三等九鎊。行程十日。</p>
<p>（丙）大英公司有「客賽祺」，「頓浦拉」，「賴欠」，「拉華品弟」，「廣東」，「考夫」，「切脫拉爾」，「拉浦打拿」等輪。票價：頭等英金二十鎊，二等十四鎊（無三等）。</p>
<p>（丁）北德公切有「桑霍司脫」，「格拉新拿」，「寶芝遽」輪。票價與大英公司同。</p>
<p>（戊）藍烟囱公司有「赫克脫」，「晏吞拿」，「派脫繼克勒司」，「沙不登」輪。票價頭等英金十八鎊（二三等無）。</p>
<h3>國有鐵路　客票實行加價</h3>
<p>— 保城</p>
<p>自事變以來，各國有鐵路，雖多數因環境關係，不能繼續行駛，然交通機關，仍儘量發揮其本能，努力於交通工作。除原有之國有鐵路，在可能範圍，仍繼續通車者外，同時並增加路綫，以利交通。如最近之湘桂，湘黔等鐵路，均係戰後實行通車者也。茲接可靠消息，現交通部已規定自本年五月十一日起，各國有鐵路客票實行加價，先試辦三月，規定下列辦法：</p>
<p>（一）所有客票，自是日起，一律照加百分之廿五加價計算。</p>
<p>（二）所有計算之尾數，仍照以前之不滿五分者，即按五分計算，五分以上之不滿一角者，即按一角計算之辦法。</p>
<p>（三）包裹，臥鋪票，月台票，及快車加價，均照舊辦理。</p>
<p>（四）發售特快票，應先將快車票除去，加百分之廿五後，再另加快車費。</p>
<p>（五）孩童票，團體票，來回票，及軍人半價票等，均按加價後之票價，再行折减。</p>
<p>（六）補罰票價，亦應按加價後之票價，再加罰半倍。</p>
<p>（七）在現用客票上加蓋「奉令加價25％」之戳記，在路局會計處未製發該項戳記前，可用紅墨水筆註明上項字樣。</p>
<p>按國有鐵路客票，此决增加達四分之一之鉅，不可不謂過多，然而在此國難期問，似此區區之加價費用，各界尚亦不至感覺有何不滿也。</p>
<h3>航空交通</h3>
<p>— 星</p>
<p>歐亞航空公司西南航錢，即渝港，渝滇河，及蓉渝綫，前因飛機缺少，曾一度中止飛行，現均已漸次恢復，惟班期較少耳星</p>
<p>渝港綫之渝桂段定星期三五日南下，星期一三五北上。桂港段仍定爲不定期夜航，以是渝港直接航線，該公司於每星期往返飛行有三决之多，其飛行日期仍係無定期者。渝滇爲星期一日南下，星期五日北上，滇河（即越南河內）錢爲星期二六當日往返。蓉滇綫爲星期四當日往返。至於該公司之西北各綫，現已在完全停頓狀態中，其所訂票價，則一仍如前，關於中國航空公司之航綫及票價等等，則仍無變更。</p>
<h3>入桂行程</h3>
<p>— 慤厂</p>
<p>在廣州尚未放棄以前，凡是由上海往廣西去的，可以先乘輪船到香港，然後自香港乘電輪到梧州；到梧州後，再乘公共汽車經貴縣以至柳州，再自柳州往桂林或其他的地方，就很方便了。如此的行程，不過需時四日，（係指自香港起程而言，上海至香港一段，耍看你乘的是什麼船了。）旅費三四十元而已，但是自從廣州放棄以後，此路不通，再往廣西去，就比較困難了。曾有一度可以在廣州灣登陸，也能去廣西，可是自海南島被佔，此路亦受影響。不過我們的交通當局，並不因爲戰事而影響到開發西南交通的使命，戰事儘管演變，公路等交通，仍在不斷的進展。雖然因爲路綫比較的延長，時間上未免要增多，但是無論如何，我們是不會受到阻礙的。現在我們這條去廣西的捷徑，就是一個例；</p>
<p>在今日之下，要是自上海前去廣西，第一步總是先到法屬海防，滬防間有直接輪船可通。大菜問分二百二十五元及二百十五元兩種，二等大菜間一百九十元，官艙九十元，房艙六十六元，吊舖四十四元。（海防直達雖然比較轉道香港經濟一些，不過行期要需十日左右，如若不願意多躭擱的話，還是由香港轉道的好。）在去海防以前，應先向政府請領經越南之過境護照，每張應納費國幣八元，繳最近照片五張，覓得相當保證人，中國旅行社可以代辦請領手續，爲期的四個星期。如若由香港轉道，可向香港大道中佛蘭西銀行五樓外交部簽證處請領須繳呈四寸半身照片三張，及塡具領照事項表二份，由港地股實店舖或司理人簽章擔保，述同護照費二元，印花稅費四元，親自送交該處，討回收據，的四五天後，卽可持據取領。（下期登完）</p>

<h3>健美女郎怎能滿意衰弱丈夫</h3>
<p>世間最公平的事，莫如半斤和八兩配，要是半斤和九兩配，那就要表現不平的現象，不平則鳴，這是理所當然。一個花枝招展的健美女郎，她怎能嫁給一個體貌不揚而又衰弱無能的丈夫呢？可是事實上「巧婦常伴拙夫眠，這真是人世間的唯一憾事！</p>
<p>健美女郎應該嫁一個英俊有為的丈夫，那才是郎才女貌，真的一對天人，婚後愛情，必然繾綣甜蜜，生男育女，家庭美满，享受着人生無限幸福！要是嫁了一個衰弱無能的丈夫，妳雖用盡了濃情蜜意，但他仍然冷淡虛偽，因己無能為力也，這怎能不使妳心灰意懶？然而詔光如駛，眼看年華虛度，更何能不痛心疾首？因此，夫婦間的悲劇，如勃谿爭吵，別居離婚，私通私奔，厭世自殺等情事也就不一而足！</p>
<p>在生理上的研究，男子的體格，應當比較女子為健壯，能力也應當比較豐富，何以而弄得如此衰弱無能？這據醫學上的論斷，大都為男子於早年犯有自凟遺精，或早婚縱慾，與荒淫無度所致。因為我們的狀貌發育與健康壽命，關係於生殖機能者殊大，如果主持生殖機能的生殖腺液枯竭，則新陳代謝作用減退，發育機能停滞，神經枯耗，凡發育不全，未老先衰，早洩陽萎，神經衰弱等症象即相繼而來，這樣的男子，無論身體本來為如何健壯，亦必一落千丈，不特夫婦生活的不能美滿，自怨自艾，甚至縮短了天年，蒙受生離死別之慘！</p>
<p>時代的聰明丈夫，何以要弄别如此山窮水盡？今日為醫學昌明的世界，上述症象，已有特效療法可以補救。特效療法為何？即根據生殖腺內分泌的原理，搜集雄壯動物，如猩猩，猿猴，海狗，虎狼，熊鹿等在其體中提取生殖腺素，再用科學方法複製成劑，因此劑係由奥國生理學家斯丹那博士所發明，故即為「斯丹那氏生殖素」，藥分男女兩用，男子服男用「生殖素」後，則於二十四小時内即能生精補腎，健腦活血，滋養神經，助長發育機能，調養新陳代謝作用，繼續服用三日以後，輕症者痊愈，重症者減輕，服用半月以後，可使百病霍然，身體益臻健康。德國名醫Wansdling望斯德鄰博士曾將此劑與他劑作比較試驗。結果「生殖素」之功能恒超出其他類似製劑之五倍以上足見此劑之名貴與功效之確實。惟有遺精者，須兼服「希米脫氏固精片」以固精關，制止遺洩，則標本兼治，收效尤速！</p>

<h3>乳峯萎癟的影響與補救</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士姚崇培</p>
<p>綺年玉貌正年輕，</p>
<p>何事雙乳萎癟甚？</p>
<p>出入交際皆竊笑，</p>
<p>春閨夢裏感飄零！</p>
<p>現在有許多年輕女子，說她們的面貌呢？倒也美麗的，性情呢？倒也溫柔的，舉動和思想呢？也算大方而敏捷的，可是她們有一種乳峯萎癟的缺陷。老是不把它放在心上，有的雖然放在心上，但總因循着不肯澈底去求彌補，祇圖遮羞於一時，戴上些假面具，就算以為完事了，但事實上，那里有這樣便當。試瞧乳峯萎癟的女子，無論她穿上怎樣漂亮輕薄的旗袍，祇覺得蠢陋可憐，有甚肉感動人之處？因為現代人士所標榜的曲線美，完全需要高聳的乳峯來做基礎，如是乳峯萎癟或平坦一如男子者，則曲線何由形成？於是雖具一等的才貌，竟因此而湮滅不彰，倘才貌較遜者，則不但出入交際塲中，必為人人所竊笑，即於夫婦之間，亦受盡種種鄙視，結果其命運必非常悲慘！唯一補救辦法據世界婦科名醫哈佛浴克愛立司博士及余經騐，均公認以服卵巢内分泌製劑女用『生殖素』最為對症而特效。蓋乳峯萎癟的主要原因，為卵巢機能失健，如此時以雄健動物的卵巢分泌補人失健的女性體內，自然立顯偉大的功效，故服此劑满四星期者，面色益顯嬌艷，食慾激增，萎癟的乳峯，亦日見膨脹，如連續服至六星期以上，則不但乳峯呈高聳狀態，同時且能將一切月經不調，白带，不感諸症完全治愈，增進夫婦間愛情，强身駐顏。</p>
<h3>遺精最合理的療法</h3>
<p>— 性病專科醫師詹念曾</p>
<p>有許多人懷疑青年人的遺精症，是很難根治的。這是錯誤的概念。誠有良醫於此，探得其病根所在，然後作「對症下藥」，那沒有不克日見效的，俗云：『藥對如開鎖』這是易如反掌的事情，要是不能探得其病根所在，或知其病根而無適當的藥物，那是很感棘手的。所以我們只承認遺精病根的難測和治遺特效藥物的不多，而不承認遺精的難治。</p>
<p>事實勝於雄辯，有很多沉淪在苦海中的遺精患者經過我們的對症下藥，而重登光明之路了。因為根據我們多年的經騐，深知遺精大都為青年犯有自凟與縱慾，把性神經弄得衰弱了，精關弛鬆了，精囊裏的精液於是就無法控制，乃有遺精滑精，甚至有早洩的現象發生。並且有了這種現象，必須及早防止。否則精關愈遺愈鬆，性神經愈遺愈弱，那就有精枯血竭，百病叢生之危！最普遍者為腦衰健忘，失眠心悸，腰酸背痛，腎虧陽萎，發育不全，未老先衰等症，弄到這步田地，不特前途與幸福喪盡；並且元氣大虧，生機也奄奄一息了！</p>
<p>遺精是合理的療法，就是應從鞏固精關，鎮靜神經着手，德國希米脫博士所秘製之「希米脫氏固精片」，即完全具此功能。患者於服後即能鞏固精關，安靜神經，使夜得酣眠，夢幻減少，遺精可於當夜即止，如因遺精已引起上述症象者，須兼服生殖腺素製劑「生殖素」，以培補腦肾精血及神經，能繼續服用，必可於短期内根治各症，使身體益臻健康。患者若能親來本診所施用電療注射等法，則收效尤速！</p>

<h3>瀰漫性的白濁之新解救</h3>
<p>在濁毒已被新發明之特藥「大○六」征服之後，其流行之慘烈，已遠不如從前，而代其盛行之位置者，厥爲淋病一症是矣。不但如從前梅毒之流行，而且更甚於前。因淋毒之瀰漫性，在許多之通都大邑中，其患淋毒之男子，實較健全之男子爲多，是無可諱言之事也。因此吾人對於淋病之療法，實不可不作徹底之研究，使此如火如荼之淋毒，作迅速之撲滅。惟如多數墨守陳法之市醫，往往死守某一則療法，如單用一種藥，或一種手術，以應付千變萬化之淋病，如何能望淋毒尅日就愈，還我人之幸福乎？現在稍具時代頭腦之醫家，其對於治療淋毒，尤其足應付瀰漫性之淋病，實覺刻不容緩之事。現在分别言之。</p>
<p>對於頑固而兼瀰漫性之白濁，診斷與療法，宜作最大努力者考究。先之以精密之診斷，判明其屬於急慢性淋中之前後尿道炎，攝護腺炎，睪丸，關節火，膀胱炎等，而後用對症之治療，庶幾指日可愈。例如淋毒性關節炎，睪丸炎等，必須用德國希氏血淸注射，始可消滅廣泛性之淋菌，而膀胱炎初起時以不用機械療法爲宜，惟過於難治，則可行洗滌法。攝護腺炎時可擇用振動按摩法，温氏冷却法，電氣按摩法，及坐藥等。可知即淋毒性之某一症狀，却有許多療法。世有至老專固執某一療法，某一種劣藥，以爲應付者，豈非欺人之談。至於電療方法，以德國濾淋平流電療法，治療各症，更有特效。</p>

<p>滬埠外棉交易、昨日黑市匯兌仍屬混亂不堪、較小之廠、因經經濟力溥　、存底較薄、前拋出之棉紗過多、深恐將來購棉困難、昨日忍痛　進印棉數千件、引項外棉均係同業獲厚利後售出、外棉洋行、自星期三起、均無只包交易、故洋行方面之交易、須　外　穩定後主存繼續交易、</p>

<h3>開浚吳淞江口</h3>
<p>吳淞江口即蘇州河工程，當時築壩於大王廟之西，其迤東固不甚淤塞，况江闊而築壩亦難，是以未經併浚。洋商議及，原已多時；今厲太守來滬會勘浦灘駁岸工程，日領事官等，遂邀同至怡和碼頭，乘坐小火輪船，一路由工部局熟悉水利人員，丈量深淺，至新閘之西原壩處所起岸。據云必再開浚其江口。此决議用汽機捻挖，不復築壩矣。</p>

<h3>公園門劵的加價</h3>
<p>— 新夢</p>
<p>上海是這樣的擠居着，空氣那樣麼混濁，要是附近有公園，誰都高興去走走，允其是大熱大，公園裏是最好的乘凉之處。因此，住公園附近的人家，大概每一家總買幾張長期門劵，每天上公園去遊玩的。</p>
<p>本來畏期門劵，並不分色，是男女一樣的，所以衹要購了一張門券，不管男女，都可進去，但自前年起，男女的顏色是不同了，這樣一來，就是夫婦倆的小家庭，也非各買一張長期門劵不可。</p>
<p>到了去年，方法又改變了，各公園通用的長期門劵，每張加至二元，個別的才是一元，所謂個別，你買門劵，指定衹准遊覽兆豐公園，那外灘公園和膠州公園就不通用，非再買臨時的門券不可。</p>
<p>照公共租界公園的定律，長期門券有效的時期是一年，自六月一日起，到翌年的五月三十一日爲止。現在正是換新門券的時候，可是各公園通用的長券，又要加到三元了。如果兆豐公園除外，那照舊一元。</p>
<p>這種辦法是由工務委員向工部局董事提出意見的，所據的理由是因爲租界擠居而後，兆豐公園遊人日多，竟造成了空前未有的新紀錄。遊客一多，園內的設備不免被人糟蹋，更有人濫拖椅子，踐踏花草，把瓜皮果壳隨處拋棄，換句話說，爲限止遊客起見，所以要加價，甚至有人主張加至每張五元。另一面，膠州公園和外灘公園所以不加，是爲了遊客的不多。</p>
<p>這種辦法，未免使我們有些不滿。兆豐公園的所以遊客衆多，是爲園地寬大，空地淸鮮，設備也比較完美。至於膠州公園，地方既小，樹木也不多，而外灘公園，空氣的混濁，正和鬧市中一樣。租界上所以有公園，是供給住民的休憇和遊散，租界內的空氣是到處汚濁，人們能够到兆豐公園這樣的園子去走走，那自然可演淸心，而且有益於身體健康。可是却加到了從前三倍的售價。</p>
<p>如果這决的加價，爲了要减少公園遊客，那麼租界當局正注意到住民的衛生問題，打防疫針哩，種牛痘哩，向來積極推行，要是確信常遊公園也可减少疾病，有益衛生，那似乎有些矛盾。如果說遊客有意毀損花草器物，這我可以說祇是少數，受過敎育的人，決不會如此。譬如公園裏不准摘一花朶，有人摘花，就要處罰，我們可始終不看見有遊客摘花。所以對於遊客的不守規則，儘可加派巡捕，實行嚴密監視，總之，我們對於這决的加價，認爲不必要。實行加價之後，果然使好多人不再去遊園，却不是設立公園的本旨吧，另一面，遊公園的人，當然要各自警惕，勿任毀損園裏的一花一物，不違犯遊園的規則，使人家對我們留一個好印象，也是一件重要的事情哩。</p>
<h3>答一個收銅元者</h3>
<p>— 編者</p>
<p>你的「自白」收到了。如果你的「自白」確是眞實的話，那末，四日那篇「上海的銅元流向那里云了」是和你無關的，請你不必「抱愧」和「不安」。</p>
<p>據你的「自白」，因爲失業，才替某號向各處收買銅元，以謀什一之利。某號之所以要你收買銅元，是爲了應付每天門市部的「找頭」；旣是應付「我頭」，那末，這些銅兀依舊流通在市面上，而現在的問題，是上海的銅元大吿缺乏，這可見另有一批「收銅元者」把銅元運到另外一個地方去的，—這也就是你的「自白」中所謂「不得而知」的理由，而我能吿訴你的，也祇如此而己。</p>
<p>可是也得請你注意的，這家所謂「某號」也者，是吾如你所設想的一樣，是爲了「應付門市找頭一而奉託你去收買銅元，希望你能找到較好的職業，同時「注意」現在的職業。</p>
<h3>「苦樂鴛鴦」觀感</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Made　For　Each　Other”</p>
<p>看完了「苦樂鴛鴦出來，我的心頭彷彿積壓着重量的鉛塊，而詹姆士史都華的影子也始終在我的眼前幌着，這個可憐的小職員，是否眞如「苦樂鴛鴦」的結束一樣：婆媳和好；立升高級職員；重新建立快樂的完滿家庭？</p>
<p>環顧我們的四週（自然我自己也在內），幾乎從每個人的臉上可以找出詹姆士史都華的影子來，他們的夢想」，如逝去的光陰一般，一點影蹤也沒有，而一切不幸的遭遇，却一步一步的逼壓着他，他們的結柬，是不能想像的？</p>
<p>我想，每個同命運的詹姆士史都華看完了這個戲，他們一定是和我同感的。</p>
<p>「苦樂鴛鴦」的所以感人之深，第一常然是找到了這樣一個現實的題材，第二是詹姆士史都華和卡洛朗白精湛的演技，而導演的翰克洛威爾（John　Cromwell）卓越的手腕，更是帮助本片成功的最大關鍵。</p>
<p>詹姆士史都華的律師事務所幫辦的翰馬遜，他是獲得最大的成功的。他忠於職務，懦弱，如練習了一夜的辭職演詞，到見了杜立德爾律師之後，喃喃不敢啟口，反而得到了一個减薪的消息。而沉浸在戀愛中的那種欣慰之狀，和第一次做爸爸的驚喜交集，都能表演出這樣一個人物的性格。</p>
<p>卡洛朗白一反她過去的作風，飾演馬遜的妻子，她溫柔，體貼，愛護丈夫；而在家庭口角，孩子罹病以後，她的憤怒，悲切，前後判若兩人的性格，是超過以前的演技的。</p>
<p>約翰克洛威爾的卓越手腕，可以從幾方面來叙述：</p>
<p>第一：人物性格的把握，馬遜這個人物，從開始和琪恩締結起，他是始終刻割得非常鮮明的。如捧着照片上事務所，和杜立德爾請求蜜月旅行假期，結婚後的家庭生活……把一個剛沉浸於甜蜜生活中的小職員，寫得親切而可愛。之後一切惡運接踵而來，這懦弱的馬遜迫得一籌莫展的時候，他祗能大聲的斥駡，和在飲，導演者從每一件細小的動作上，把馬遜這樣的人物勾劃了出來</p>
<p>第二：情緒氣氛的把握，這也得分作前後兩部，前面的輕快，活潑，和後面恰恰成了强烈的對照，而每一塲戲都緊緊地拉着觀衆的心，不肯放鬆一步。</p>
<p>第三：着重於經濟的壓迫，如宴會時的討債；生了孩子以後付醫院的賬款（在賬單加蓋Paid印章）；孩子生病，向杜立德爾借款五千元等等。從這方面來闡明這對小夫婦的遭遇是什麼造成的，這是非常感動人的。</p>
<p>其他如畫面編織的簡潔，鏡頭角度及燈光的運用，都帮助木片獲得藝術上的成功。</p>
<p>自從大上海重新開幕以來，這是最優秀的一部戲，而因爲過去的選片標準過低，「苦樂鴛鴦」並不引起觀衆的注意，這是遺憾得很，不過這也給予一個很好的敎訓，專門注意「生意眼，並不是最好的營業方法。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十一回　認鄉親杵臼舊生涯　附權勢簪纓新貴族</p>
<p>趙樂天後來也死了這條心了，一個愛國男子，怎能心裹橫梗着戀愛兩字？腦中常留着亭亭倩影？他習練着放槍，槍無虛發，本是最精的射手。後來他在某一義勇軍中，是當了個機關槍手又是一個最精嫻的機關槍手。在別一個機　槍手，也沒有見到對方的影子便拍拍拍的亂搖着機關槍。趙樂天却不肯，他說：『我們要愛惜子彈，我們不能無的放槍。你們只聽得拍拍拍一陣子響，不知道這一陣響聲中，要花費多少價値。我們的軍需不容易，我們不能浪費呢。』父因爲趙樂天瞄得準確，而且善於隱蔽，對方不知迸他的子彈，却從那裏飛來的。他輕輕地一搖，並沒有接連十分長的繼續下去，可是就有接速的人，東一個，西一個，應身而倒。他本隊裏，有幾位聽慣趙樂天的機關槍聲音的，一聽就知道是他的。拍拍拍，拍拍拍，聲音短勁而凝鍊，不似那些冗長而無力的，這就是他的不肯浪費，收勒得住的地方。他後來升到了一個隊長在他與人對戰的時候，還是自搖着機關槍。有一次是夜襲，也是奪取對方的　重車。他們這一隊人，不過二三百人，却是分散在各處，四面埋伏着；對方有相等的人，而且他們的軍機，還比我們的精利不少。只是在黃昏月黑之天，他們却不知道我們人數有多少。我們的人，時時在栘戲着，因爲我們熟悉這裏的地形。譬如在這邊放幾槍後，又連忙移到那邊又放幾槍，故作疑兵之計，好像我們人數很多。我們的機關槍，也時時栘動着，這邊拍拍拍，那邊拍拍拍，使得對方瞎天盲地，東竄西奔，不知走到那裏去好，那時却被我們　滅了不少。允其是趙樂天的機關槍，他也是時時移動着，拍拍拍幾響，每見有幾個黑影子拱地爬不起沐。却不知道有一個兵士，他手中正擎着一個手溜彈，他肩頭上中着一顆機關槍子的時候，他覺得前面樹叢中火光一閃，他便把手溜彈撩了過去。他原想炸毀那架機關槍的，誰知轟的一聲，機關槍沒有炸着，那個手溜彈却從地面上彈起來，炸傷了趙樂天的脚了。正是</p>

<p>游藝界</p>
<h3>對於劇運的一點意見</h3>
<p>— 楊非</p>
<p>把那意識陳　，低級趣味，凡俗無聊的舊劇觀眾劇，而且也包括改良平劇，粤劇·甚至於文明戲等。只要內容與現實有聯繫，能够激發觀衆的正義感，對白唱詞比較地通俗淺顯，化裝佈景採取新式的技衛的，那都將在戲劇界打開一條進步的有意義的新路。</p>
<p>所以，像阿英·于玲·李健吾等所編導的話劇我們果然需要；像歐陽予倩所編導的改良乎劇，永安劇社所編排的改良粤劇（如「荊軻傳」只是取材較差）等，我們也是需要的。</p>
<p>我希望這許多新劇還動者合作起來，交換經騐，互商改進，最好能交巷地或是同塲地演出（像在中法劇藝社新年藝人同樂會中那麼地）來多方而地吸引觀衆，讓觀衆們化在外國影片上的金錢，化在無聊消遺上的精力，拿來換取滋補一點的精神食糧。</p>
<p>最近，于玲改編的「滿城風雨」在新光公演，「新演劇社實騐劇塲」舉行星期公演「偽君子」。始終是站在劇運先驅的話劇界，在這樣荊棘叢叢的孤島環境中，還是再接再厲地努力着，道是值得我們欽佩而且欣喜的事。不過，我感到：話劇遝動奢同時也得顧到那存着因襲與趣的觀眾，要爭取他們，那末話劇界單槍匹馬的奮鬥殊嫌不夠，應得聯合舊劇者，做到「全滬劇人之精誠團結，共同地商討並推動劇運之新的開展。</p>
<p>我期望這件事情能够趕速實現。</p>
<p>最後，我又希望愛看戲劇或電影的同胞們，要常警覺着自己，勿儘把金錢精力送在麻醉心靈的無聊娛樂上，拿它節省下來去看看意識正確一點的新劇，以求得一些有意義的娛樂吧！</p>
<h3>全滬攝影家聯合舉行　電影明星照片展覽會</h3>
<p>— 辛士</p>
<p>大義賣一體動員收羅宏富</p>
<p>諸般精美出品多至千餘幅</p>
<p>華南名影星李綺年女士，最近一度將她自己的幾百幅照片，在香港舉行義賣，所得售款，用以救濟難胞。李女士是當地擁有最多觀衆的第一流紅明星，她這許多芳影，既為一般影迷所珍視，而如此義舉，又很博得廣大的同情；所以結果情形十分美滿，難胞們受惠不少。</p>
<p>義賣動機上海許多攝影家們，大家鑒於李女士的義舉，確屬法良意美、極可仿行。最近，經杜鰲·翁飛鵬·穆一龍·李世芳·馬永華·何佐明等數十人共合發起，擴大地組織了一個「中國電影照片攝影人協會」，準備各將所有作品，集成一千餘幅，來舉行一個盛大的「當影明星照片展覽會」。</p>
<p>組織情形這事件經連日集　之下，一切大要辦法，業已協商決定。關於組織情形，推定杜　·穆一龍·李世芳等七人爲籌備委員，由伍聯德君負責主辦，總其大成。內部辦事方面，分設總務，徵集，事務，財務，宣傳等六股，各負責專員，協力進行。——同時，他們更請上海難民習藝所方面協助一切，參加主辦。將來所得售款，亦即是全數捐充該所經費的。</p>
<p>展覽辦法展覽會的照片，計分照相簿，放大照片，分組小照片，電影呆照，彩色照片，彩印畫片，幻燈片。代售照片等九類，而以中國電影明星單人照片爲主體；此類影星芳名，白蝴蝶·顧蘭君·袁美雲·陳雲裳·金　·高占非·趙丹等以下，並包括早年時期的楊耐梅·張織雲諸人，以及已故世的阮玲玉·葉娟娟·陸麗霞等在內，總計達一百徐人。所有展覽各照，概以十二時者為標準，標價議定每張一律四元。</p>
<p>明星簽字展覽日期限定十天，在此十天期內，另外特備十大女明星，放大彩色，配就精美鏡架之照片各一事，事先排定日期及時間，每天邀請明星一人到會，爲承購此項特種照片者臨塲簽字。每幅標價至少當在五十金以上，並祗限定每星一幅，以見名貴。</p>
<p>會期確定展覽會地點，昨已假定新新公司四層大會塲，日期定自七月十八日起至二十七日止共十天。俟於舉行完畢之後，復須另備全部出品，運往香港，去作一番盛大的展覽。</p>
<p>全滬名攝影家此决見義勇爲運用集體力量，來舉行大義賣，一片熱忱，極堪欣佩。電影明星的照片，旣爲一般影迷所愛好；而這般集體的行動，和李綺年女士照片的個展，其力量自然是大不相同。所以預料所得成績，當極優越，爲難胞造福無量。</p>
<h3>白宅戲作罷</h3>
<p>昨分電通知各名伶　白夫人將離滬避壽</p>
<p>關於白宅堂戲的籌備經過，本刋已詳細發表，大家都熱烈地希望它能實現，可是昨天記者多方探聽，知道這堂戲已決定作罷。據某聞人親口所述：白宅經愼重考慮，一則因親長勸阻，在此時期，不便過分鋪張，二則消息　動之後，事務方面一定很難措置；三則壽辰將屆，時間委實太迫促了，所以他們就把堂戲的計劃打銷。昨已分電平津各名伶請勿南來，而白夫人與白先生預定十三日離滬避壽，目的地並未宜佈。據說那位白先生是德國人，莫怪大家對他很生疏了</p>
<h3>大陸游泳場　將舉行影星游泳比賽</h3>
<p>— 高風</p>
<p>轟動了整個上海的大陸游泳塲，很湊巧的在昨天一個最熱的天氣中開幕了。太陽雖然露着猙　的面孔，抓住着柏油路溶化，但這條靜安寺路，依然還是熙來　往的人山人海，一個個的　大陸游泳塲大門進去。一時正開幕，由仙樂舞宮內洛平無隊　樂，一會兒在播音機裹傳出了極雄壯的音樂，於是站在池邊很久而躍躍欲試的許多中西男女游泳迷，都一個個的望水裹穿，乒乒乓乓打成了一片怪淸脆的聲音，偌大的一個游泳池，一霎時也就擠得滿坑滿谷了。</p>
<p>這時我繞着四周看台巡禮了一周，只見男女電影明星和平劇伶人，佔着不少的小圓　，在喝冷飲，正在這時候，我遇見了該場經理陸家駿和吳瑞生二君，他們告訴我，現在還正積極籌備電影明星的游泳比賽消息，如果這消息一旦變成事實，那末這偌大的水上樂園定會擠滿了千千萬萬的影迷和游泳迷哩！今年的大陸游泳塲，已用一種最新的姿態出現在孤島上五百萬民衆的面前，它的轟動並不是偶然，而是必然的。</p>

<h3>舒蘊珠特寫</h3>
<p>凡漫遊仙樂舞宮者，大概都曉得有一個大杭州，一個小杭州，大杭州年事已近花信，世故人情，都很周到，近日已脫離舞榭，從良乎？息影乎？非局外人所得聞知；小杭州藝名舒蘊蘭，雙十年華，已長成，略諳世故，穉氣猶未盡脫，平時頗矜持，偶於熟人前一流露耳。余友多人，皆樂與偕舞，光是，小杭州之行動多隨大杭州爲轉（廿六）　移，大杭州息影舞謝後，小杭州乃常須獨當一面，而繼昔時小杭州之地位者，又有小小杭州者出焉。</p>
<p>小小杭州者，舞界初無其名，余無以名之，强名之耳，藝名舒蘊珠，或云，是小杭州之妹，小杭州亦自承爲其妹，然觀其貌，不似也，小杭州呼之，則曰阿慧，客或戲呼其阿慧者，則微慍，曰，呼阿珠可也。總之，舞女家庭事，類多難言之隱，但當憐之，不必强事探索，或謂余知之而故勿宜洩者，設然，亦君子之道也。</p>
<p>蘊珠身長玉立，年的二八·二九之間，不事修飾，未可謂之美，不可不謂之趣，蓋天眞活潑，如忘憂草，如解語花，有卓別林之滑稽，有秀蘭鄧波兒之伶俐，余友宋先生頗賞識之，未存絲毫男女之念也。蘊珠酒量頗宏，又善歌，若酒酣耳熱，則啟喉高歌，不顧鄰座，舞塲流行之中西歌曲，固無論矣，即申曲，蘇灘，平劇，甚至紹興高調，亦大都你有上文，她有下句，諸君若偶有煩悶，不妨邀之一飱，大可抵一劑消愁散也。平日對於無票，不甚注意，然偶遇吃湯糰時，亦知愁銷雙眉，殆懼譏責耳，茶舞在大華，夜舞今日隨乃姊進大都會，與曹素琴姊妹，坐鄰棹。</p>

<p>我一個人坐在慧生扮戲的地方同他撩天，却不願陪着他們罰站，誰知等了一回，馬連良扮范仲禹出塲啦，我忙問後臺諸人，這是怎麼回事？到底叔岩有戲沒戲？不料他們比我更糊塗，全說余三的話可沒準，他臺上的玩藝，處處都是人做的，私下的人性樣樣都不是人口的，忠孝節義全在臺上唱完，所以私下裏就不仁不義了。論起來一齣戲至多一個鐘頭，就掙三四千塊大洋錢，還得端足了架子，憑老板高興，從前譚老板外串也不過二百塊錢一，他也未免有點過天啦。不佞聽了這位老班底的議論，覺得今天有些靠不住了；本想招呼同來的幾位一同走路，誰知上下塲門都擠滿了，一位扮煞神的角兒在人叢中直嚷衆位讓開點，該我出去啦，連推帶嚷，半天才擠了出去。我一想這個情形不對，不如獨自溜下吧。第二天見了傳先生，才知道小余又騙了人家一次，把本家和男女來賓都氣得要死。那一天因爲臺上全站滿了人，塲面上人都受了影饗，內中有一位摩登小姐穿着高跟鞋站了半日，當然疲了，一個不留神，被人一擠，幾乎栽倒臺上。可巧連良的琴師趙貴元方在拉着「平板二黃」，被她一碰，胡琴也摔在地下啦，絃子也全斷啦，雖是看客們能原諒他們這種特殊的情形，但是連良的脾氣極壞，立時就駡開啦。後來趙貴元換了楊寳忠，就是因爲這决擇琴（非伯牙）斷絃的原故。</p>
<p>北平是　　幾代居住的地方，而且近在咫尺，他都能屢决臨時變卦，使人大失所望，何况遠在數手里外的上海，倘他本人未蒞滬埠以前，那是誰也不敢斷定他是準來參加某宅堂會的。（三三）</p>

<h3>A Large Number of Japanese Planes Again Attacked Chongqing Yesterday, Two Were Shot Down by the Chinese Side; Bombs Rained Down, and Fires Broke Out in the City; Nanning and Enshi Were Also Bombed; Two More Groups Harassed the Xiang Border</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) On the afternoon of the 9th, two waves of Japanese planes took off from Hankou and flew west to invade. The first wave consisted of nine planes, which dropped bombs in Enshi, Hubei Province. The second wave consisted of more than 20 planes, which went straight to attack Chongqing. The Chinese air defense authorities issued air raid and emergency alerts. The Japanese planes then split into two groups, one of nine and one of twelve, which successively sneaked into the city's airspace. The Chinese air force and anti-aircraft units launched a fierce attack on them, and two Japanese planes were shot down by the Chinese. The search for the wreckage is currently underway. When the Japanese planes sneaked into the city's airspace, they dropped bombs indiscriminately in several places and then fled. Because the Chinese air defense and rescue efforts were well-organized, although fires broke out in several places, they were quickly extinguished, and there were very few casualties. (9th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Chongqing was again subjected to an air raid by Japanese planes tonight. A total of 27 Japanese bombers, divided into two teams, attacked, raining bombs on the same areas that suffered a terrible bombing on May 25. A major fire broke out in the city. Chinese anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely at the Japanese planes, and several Chinese fighter planes also took to the air to intercept them. The results of the air battle are not yet known, but the anti-aircraft gun units said that they had shot down two Japanese planes. At 6 p.m., Japanese planes were seen flying over Yichang and heading upstream. An alert was immediately issued in Chongqing. At 7 p.m., the first team of Japanese planes, consisting of nine bombers, appeared over Chongqing. More than half an hour later, the second team, consisting of 18 planes, arrived in succession. Before reaching Chongqing, the nine Japanese planes had bombed Enshi on the border of Sichuan and Hubei. (9th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Yichang) Forty-seven Japanese planes flew in several batches over Yichang around 1 p.m. on the 9th, and fled westward. Among them, nine again invaded Enshi and bombed it. (9th Telegram)</p>
<p>Hengyang: According to air defense reports, on the morning of the 9th, eleven Japanese planes flew in two batches along the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway to harass the Xiang border. One batch of eight planes, with three planes circling in the Liling area and five planes sneaking into Hengyang at 9:50 a.m. to drop bombs. Another batch of three planes also sneaked in from Jiangxi and joined the Japanese planes in Liling to observe the Zhuzhou area. (9th Telegram)</p>
<p>Guilin: Sixteen Japanese planes took off from Beihai at 9 a.m. on the 9th and sneaked into Nanning's airspace at 10 a.m., dropping more than 30 bombs, mostly in the wilderness, injuring only three people and destroying six or seven houses. (9th Telegram)</p>
<p>Fuzhou: A Japanese warship-based plane took off six times today to bomb Changmen, dropping 14 bombs. (9th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) At 7:10 p.m. this evening, Chongqing was attacked by two waves of Japanese planes, lasting a total of fifteen minutes. During this period, first nine Japanese planes sneaked into Chongqing's airspace, followed by eighteen Japanese planes, dropping more than 30 bombs on Chongqing's urban area. The Japanese planes were flying at an altitude of 7,000 feet, and there were low clouds overhead in Chongqing at the time. At the same time, Chinese fighter planes also took off to meet the enemy, so the first batch of eight Japanese planes were intercepted by Chinese planes and could not move freely. However, at this time, the second batch of 18 Japanese planes invaded again. For a time, searchlights and anti-aircraft guns were active, but they were obscured by clouds and could not fully exert their power. Before long, the first batch of Japanese planes, under constant pursuit by Chinese planes outside the clouds, fled first. According to official sources, two Japanese planes have been shot down by Chinese anti-aircraft guns. It is reported that when the Japanese planes attacked, they first dropped flares to illuminate the ground like daylight before dropping bombs. The bombs dropped, as far as Chongqing is concerned, were mostly very heavy, with two weighing 500 pounds, which exploded into large craters 40 feet wide and 10 feet deep after landing. For a time, rubble flew everywhere, and even distant places were affected. One of the bombs hit a reservoir, and the water in the reservoir was splashed up to a height of eight feet. The building opposite the YMCA, owned by the Canadian Church, was heavily damaged. There were also many bombs dropped near the Sullivan Hotel, the only modern building in Chongqing. After the Japanese planes dropped their bombs, a major fire broke out in the lower city of Chongqing, but the fire brigade immediately dispatched to put out the fire, so the fire did not spread. A fire also broke out near the YMCA, but it was extinguished after the fire brigade rushed to the rescue. As for the ambulance team's actions, they were the most agile. The first to dispatch were the Girls' Ambulance Team and the Catholic Ambulance Team, led by Father Zhao, who wore long black robes, which contrasted sharply with the Red Cross Ambulance Team, who wore white clothes. By 8 p.m., the alert was completely lifted. At this time, the streets were full of pedestrians, and the shops were all open for business, as if there had been no air raid. An Associated Press reporter inspected all sides after the incident and saw that there were only three injured. It is not known how many were trapped in the rubble. In short, the number of casualties in this raid will certainly not exceed 200 people. Furthermore, many of the bombs dropped by the Japanese planes this time failed to explode. After these unexploded bombs were discovered, Chinese soldiers immediately built a fence around them to prevent civilians from approaching them. According to people familiar with the matter, the reason why there were so few casualties this time was due to the effectiveness of the anti-aircraft guns. When the anti-aircraft guns fired fiercely, the Japanese planes had no time to carefully identify their targets, so the bombs they dropped were mostly indiscriminate.

<h3>Three Routes Invade Pinglu, Japanese Casualties Reach 2,000; The Chinese Army's Goal of Attrition Has Been Achieved; Transfer to the Suburbs to Fight in the Outskirts</h3>
<p>Yuanqu: A total of 7,000 to 8,000 Japanese troops in southern Shanxi launched a large-scale invasion from Zhangdian, Yuncheng, and Jiexian in three routes, and the situation immediately became tense. One force of 3,000 to 4,000 in Zhangdian attempted to directly attack Maojin and attack Pinglu from the flanks. After the Chinese army bravely counterattacked and attacked from both sides, they have successively recovered the strongholds of Shengrenjian, Hanyao Village, and Dongdachen, and are now blocking the Japanese army in the areas of Xidachen Village and Shuntou Village, and are engaged in a standoff. One force of about 3,000 in Yuncheng, after capturing the two strongholds of Huadong Pingtou and Xindian (northwest of Pinglu), attempted to attack Pinglu. More than 3,000 Japanese troops in Jiexian, after capturing Huache Village (southwest of Pinglu), also attacked Pinglu from the flanks. A certain Chinese army unit blocked and attacked them separately, and fought a bloody battle with the Japanese army for two days, killing more than 1,000 Japanese troops, and also dispatched many daredevils to engage in bayonet melee, repeatedly charging and killing. As the Japanese reinforcements increased, the Chinese side, due to strategic considerations and the goal of attrition having been achieved, transferred to the suburbs of Pinglu at noon on the 8th and continued to attack the Japanese army in the outskirts. After the Japanese army captured Pinglu, they set fire to the villages inside and outside the city, which continued all day. A unit stationed in the city is moving towards the northeast, and a unit has sneaked into Majiazhuang on the opposite bank of Lingbao, attempting to attack Wanzhaocun (northeast of Majiazhuang). In summary, the Japanese army launched a three-pronged invasion of Pinglu this time. After the Chinese army intercepted and attacked them separately, the casualties were nearly 2,000 and countless ammunition was consumed. Although Pinglu was captured, the gains did not outweigh the losses. Generally speaking, it is judged that the Japanese's attempt this time is to try to sweep away the Chinese side's strength in the Zhongtiao Mountains. Judging from their weakened state, they have no ability to cross the river. (9th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Shaanxi Telegram: The Japanese troops who invaded Liulin Qikou in southwestern Shanxi are now in a difficult situation. The Japanese troops near Yuncheng Anyi are still under the control of the Chinese army.

The Chinese army launched a large-scale night attack at 1 a.m. on the 9th. More than 600 Japanese troops stubbornly resisted by virtue of the terrain. After a fierce battle until 4 a.m., Fuhe was recaptured by the Chinese army. All the Japanese troops retreated to Zhongxin Zhucun. In this battle, more than 200 Japanese troops were killed or wounded, four Japanese soldiers were captured, and a large number of firearms, construction materials, military supplies, and documents were seized. (9th Telegram)</p>
<p>Dali: The Japanese troops in Fushan have been under fierce attack by the Chinese army for days, and have suffered heavy casualties.

The Chinese army is currently advancing towards the suburbs. (9th Telegram)</p>
<p>Yingde: Several hundred Japanese troops in Longkou sneaked into the vicinity of Lianglong Market at noon on the 6th and were severely attacked by the Chinese army.

As of the evening of the 7th, they were still fighting in the area. (9th Telegram)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>The Crisis of the Japanese Army's Manipulation of the Shanghai Customs</h3>
<p>The Extra Deputy Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs issued a notice a few days ago stating that, starting from June 1st, in the nine Jianghai ports, merchant ships would be prevented from clearing customs and sailing without the permission of the Japanese army and navy. It is reported that customs officials have already begun to implement this order. In recent days, many foreign merchant ships sailing to these nine ports have changed their sailing locations. The British Taikoo Company's Wantong ship, because its sailing destination was Haimen Qishu, one of the nine ports listed, was refused customs clearance when it applied. Previously, the Japanese navy's inspection of British and French mail ships was regarded by various governments as an intentional blockade of the Chinese coast, and they protested to Japan. Japan claimed that it did not prohibit non-Chinese ships from sailing along the Chinese coast. Now, the facts show that Japan has disguisedly prevented foreign merchant ships from sailing in inland rivers and coastal ports. What is this if not a tightening of the blockade?</p>
<p>Japan's use of the customs to prevent foreign merchant ships from sailing in inland rivers and coastal ports is not only aimed at blockading foreign merchant ships and destroying existing European and American shipping and commerce in China. At the same time, it is also an attempt to seize the administrative power of the customs. The Jianghai Customs is one of the Chinese customs that has fallen into enemy hands, and it is also the Chinese customs with the largest revenue, and it has a very close relationship with European and American countries. Japan, fearing serious international disputes, does not handle it like other customs. After the Chinese army retreated west, it reached a so-called Anglo-Japanese Customs Agreement with the United Kingdom in May last year through peaceful negotiations. Since then, the Jianghai Customs has also become a deformed agency. On the surface, the countries concerned still claim that they will maintain the integrity of China's customs administrative sovereignty. However, in reality, the customs cannot fully implement the orders of the Chinese government. The original intention of the British side was to maintain its realistic interests through a policy of compromise. Now, not only are her realistic interests annihilated because Japan refuses to pay foreign debts, but Japan is also using the customs to destroy all her rights in China. This was not what she had expected at the beginning!</p>
<p>Now Japan seems not satisfied with the current situation of the Jianghai Customs, and it is attempting to gain full control. The order of the Deputy Commissioner is regarded as the beginning of this attempt. The so-called Deputy Commissioner was originally established by the customs authorities to cope with special circumstances. His duties should be to serve the customs, not to execute the orders of the Japanese army and navy authorities. Furthermore, does this Customs Commissioner in the Jianghai Customs have the right to issue notices and order customs officials to execute them without the approval of the original highest authority of the Jianghai Customs and the Inspector General? This is a fundamental question. If the Deputy Commissioner is not the highest administrative authority of the Jianghai Customs, then he does not have the power to issue such a notice. Issuing a notice without this authority is a destruction of the administrative power of the Jianghai Customs.</p>
<p>The action of this Deputy Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs has a considerable relationship with the current Far East situation, especially the British's compromise in the face of events, which gives Japan a great encouragement. In addition, customs officials not fulfilling their due obligations also have some responsibility. Why did the highest customs authority not try to prevent the notice issued by the Deputy Commissioner in advance? After receiving the notice, why did the customs officials not ask about the normal procedures and execute it immediately? After discovering this notice, why did the highest customs authority not order its cancellation? This is also a factor that prompted Japan's bold action. Establishing the so-called "New Order in East Asia" is Japan's guise, and it is being continuously promoted. Regarding the Jianghai Customs issue, if this action of blockading traffic in nine ports does not provoke an effective resistance from the countries concerned, similar incidents will certainly occur one after another in the future. Now it can use the customs to blockade the nine ports, and in the future it can extend to blockade other ports. With great power in hand, nothing is impossible. As long as it is absolutely beneficial to Japan, what does it care about the trade of European and American countries with China and even other interests? Therefore, the action of this Deputy Commissioner is just a preliminary probe to attempt to seize the entire administrative sovereignty of the Jianghai Customs. The relevant government officials and businessmen in China are currently discussing countermeasures. We not only hope to take effective protests and promptly repeal this prohibition, but also hope to do our best to prevent similar illegal actions from continuing to occur!</p>
<h3>Japanese Newspapers Arbitrarily Attack the Chinese Concessions in Shanghai "Eliminating British Power in the Far East Does Not Need to Take into Account the Rights of Third Countries"</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese newspapers today wrote articles arbitrarily attacking foreign concessions in China, and demanded the elimination of British power in the Far East. "Kokumin Shimbun" claimed that "Japan has decided to carry out the war of liberating Asian nations, and therefore it is necessary to solve all problems of foreign concessions once and for all." The newspaper insisted that Japan must eliminate British power in the Far East, remove "pro-British politicians" from the Japanese government, and strengthen Japan's relationship with various "friendly countries." "Asahi Shimbun" claimed that Japan has decided to adopt a tough policy towards China, and should also adopt the same policy towards third countries that take an anti-Japanese attitude. "If necessary, Japan will revoke its recognition of the British and French concessions in Tianjin." Manchukuo Counselor Ohashi published an article in various newspapers, which especially attracted the attention of political figures. The article claimed that Japan has decided not to negotiate with General Chiang Kai-shek, and this same attitude should be applied to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. If Japan does not eliminate the power of third countries in China, its war against China will never be completely successful. Ohashi advocated that Japan should carry out its plan to transform Asia with the greatest determination, without regard to the rights of third countries, so that the war against China can be ended at an early date.

<h3>Pseudo-Officials Withdraw from Tianjin Concessions</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Tianjin News: The head of the Tianjin pseudo-police bureau recently ordered that all personnel of the "Provisional Government" and the "Tianjin Municipal Government" residing in the British and French concessions must withdraw from the two concessions before June 9. This morning, more than 100 households have moved out of the concessions. It is reported that the Japanese authorities have decided to take free action. In order to show their tough attitude, the Japanese postal ship companies have withdrawn their goods from the British and French concessions and notified all customers to pick up their goods quickly. (9th Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Chinese Association of the British organ will hold a general meeting tomorrow night to discuss the situation in Tianjin. Reuters learned from reliable sources that if the four Chinese demanded by the Japanese side are not extradited, the Japanese side will take retaliatory measures to completely isolate the British concession, and will block the entrances and exits of the British concession and restrict the movement of British people, British ships, and goods, except for food. If the Japanese side takes this action, all residents of the British concession, including tens of thousands of Chinese and foreign people who are not British citizens, will suffer severe hardship, and the French concession may also be similarly affected.

<p>(London) Ambassador Guo visited British Foreign Secretary Halifax this morning for a long talk and informed him of the contents of the telegram received from the Chinese government today. The telegram instructed him to raise a protest again regarding the extradition of the four suspects who assassinated Cheng Xihou, the superintendent of the Tianjin Customs. Although these four suspects have not yet been extradited to the Japanese side, the Chinese government does not seem to be completely satisfied with this matter. There are two reasons for the Chinese protest: 1. This move will be tantamount to recognizing the government under the wing of the Japanese in Peiping. 2. It will set a dangerous precedent. Guo's visit this morning was partly of a social nature, introducing Wang Zhengting to the British Foreign Secretary. The attitude held by the British authorities is that no Chinese can be surrendered to the Chinese authorities from foreign concessions or settlements unless there is definite evidence of a criminal offense. (9th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese side issued an ultimatum to the British concession authorities yesterday morning, demanding the extradition of the four suspects who assassinated Cheng Xigeng, the superintendent of the Customs, within two days, otherwise they will completely cut off traffic between the British concession and the outside world.

<h3>Gulangyu Municipal Council Accepts Two Demands from the Japanese Side, Allowing Japanese Police to Jointly Search for Anti-Japanese Elements, and Will Study Other Demands</h3>
<p>(Xiamen) It is heard that the Gulangyu Public Concession Municipal Council has accepted the first and fifth of the five demands made by the Japanese side. According to Japanese sources, after holding a council meeting yesterday, the Chief Executive of the Municipal Council, Hsih Chih-kao-k'o, has notified Japanese Consul General Uchida to accept: 1. Strictly suppressing anti-Japanese agitation and terrorist acts. 2. Japanese police are allowed to jointly search for anti-Japanese elements with the police of the Municipal Council. He also agreed to study the third and fourth items requested by the Japanese side, namely the right of Taiwanese to vote and the appointment of three Chinese to the Municipal Council by the chairman of the Xiamen Maintenance Association. As for the second requirement of the Japanese side, namely the appointment of Japanese as the Chief Executive, Chief Inspector, and Chief Officer of the Municipal Council, and the increase in the number of Japanese police, the letter from the Municipal Council also expressed some mildness. Although it did not agree to give the three important positions of Chief Executive, Chief Inspector, and Chief Officer to the Japanese, it was prepared to employ three more Japanese police officers. It is heard that the Japanese side considers the second requirement to be the most important. (9th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>British Military Officers Detained in Zhangjiakou; Japanese Say They Will Release Them Early; Cooper Is Willing to Suffer with Spear; Japanese Plan to Send Spear to the Chinese Interior</h3>
<p>(Peiping) According to the Japanese spokesman here, the Japanese side has decided to release Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the military attache of the British Embassy in China, and his interpreter Cooper early. At the same time, according to the British Embassy, ​​the Japanese claim that the two men used the radio stations of Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces to report the activities of the Japanese army to the British authorities in Shanghai and Peiping lacks factual evidence. Japanese news agencies also claimed that the two had provided intelligence to the Chinese Communist Party and the Kuomintang. Although this claim cannot be verified, it is at least the view of the Japanese side. According to the Japanese spokesman, the interpreter Cooper could have been released, but because Cooper wanted to suffer with Spear, he was kept. As for Spear, the Japanese side intends to send him back to the Chinese interior. According to Langm, a Chinese counselor at the British Embassy, when he sought to meet with senior Japanese officials in Zhangjiakou, they refused to meet him and did not allow him to see the detained person. Later, they allowed him to exchange notes with the detained person. It is heard that the two detained military officers are being treated well and are in good health. The place of detention is the headquarters of the Japanese army stationed in Zhangjiakou. (8th Associated Press Telegram)</p>

<p>Taixian correspondence: About 200 Japanese soldiers from Funing, accompanied by five cannons and two heavy machine guns, traveled in 34 trucks through Yangsai and other places to Lianshui on the morning of the 1st. Currently, there are only about 70 Japanese soldiers in Funing city. Also, there are no more Japanese warships in the Sheyang River. The four Japanese warships anchored in Funing's Glaham Port have also sailed elsewhere.</p>
<p>At 10 a.m. on the 3rd, three Japanese planes circled over Dongtai for five weeks, strafed with machine guns, and then flew to Yancheng, dropping five bombs and one incendiary bomb in Yancheng before flying northeast. At the same time, the Taixian air defense sentry received a report from the Hai'an air defense sentry that Japanese planes had passed over Hai'an on their way north, and an air raid alert was issued, which was soon lifted.</p>
<h3>Important Bridges on the Suchang Highway Destroyed, Bridge Foundations Also Damaged</h3>
<p>Suzhou correspondence: The Suchang Highway, connecting this county to Changshu, is 43 kilometers long and was rebuilt from the old Yuanhe official road. Although it is a branch line of the Xihu Highway, its position is extremely important. Since the line was occupied by the Japanese army, the Japanese have used the line to transport military supplies and goods and have attached great importance to it. Around 12 o'clock on the night of the 1st of this month, 400 to 500 Chinese soldiers, on more than ten boats, set fire to seven bridges, the largest projects on the line, in batches, and then returned along the original route. By the time the Japanese army discovered it the next morning, the seven destroyed bridges had been completely reduced to ashes, including three at Weijingtang No. 26 in Wuxian County and three in the Donggangjing area of Changshu. Moreover, the foundations of the destroyed bridges have also been damaged, making recovery extremely difficult.</p>

<h3>British House of Lords Discusses the Reality of Aid to China, Halifax Says He Is Blameless and Will Do His Best to Protect the Interests of British Nationals</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax made a speech in the House of Lords today during a debate on foreign affairs, expressing the government's great concern and anxiety about the situation in the Far East. He said, "When a number of unfortunate incidents occurred, we did our best to ensure that the interests of British nationals were given due respect and that the provisions of treaties were respected as far as was within our power, as the actions of the Japanese side have involved the provisions of treaties in more than one respect. We will work with other powers to do everything in our power to carry out this policy." Halifax continued, "Lord Snell recently mentioned the Far East issue, the overall situation in that area, as he said before, in many ways, and because of more than one unfortunate incident, has caused great concern and anxiety to the government." Halifax said, "I can only assure Lord Snell that when a number of unfortunate incidents occurred, we did our best to ensure that British nationals received due respect. By this, I mean the interests of British nationals and their material interests. Lord Snell also mentioned the recent resolution passed in Geneva regarding aid to China and said that he had a particularly dissatisfied assessment of the sympathetic nature of the Foreign Secretary's speech to China when the Council of the League of Nations discussed this matter. It should be noted that Dr. Gu Weijun has a different opinion on this. The Doctor thanked me for expressing sympathy to China during my speech, so I replied that my conscience was not particularly tormented by Lord Snell's accusation and should be forgiven." Lord Snell spoke first today, opening the debate. Lord Snell said that the overall situation in the Far East now seems very unsatisfactory. British ships are being stopped and searched, officials are being arrested and imprisoned, and soldiers are apparently being bayonetted to death. He does not want to criticize the Foreign Secretary in any way, but his reply to the appeal seems to be disturbingly unsympathetic. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) During the afternoon session of the House of Commons today, several members of parliament from various parties raised questions about the Far East issue, which were answered one by one by Butler, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. Labor MP Ponsonby asked, "Foreign Secretary Halifax recently gave a speech at the League of Nations Council in Geneva, expressing his sympathy for China. Does the government intend to continue to implement the resolutions passed by the League of Nations and do its best to help China?" Under-Secretary of State Butler immediately replied, "Yes." Conservative MP Morgan asked, "Foreign Secretary Halifax stated at the League of Nations Council that no further assistance could be given to China. What has been the government's implementation of the resolutions passed by the League of Nations? I would like Prime Minister Chamberlain to provide a clear explanation." Under-Secretary Butler immediately provided a written reply, saying, "Mr. Morgan seems to have misunderstood. Foreign Secretary Halifax stated at the League of Nations Council that the resolutions of the League of Nations were a common policy agreed upon by all member states. The British government has never sought to deviate from it. On the contrary, it has taken action in all aspects in accordance with the obligations arising from this resolution to assist China. I intend to send Mr. Morgan a summary of the Council's agenda for him to read, so that he will know that my words are not false." A certain member then raised the case of Lieutenant Colonel Spear, the British military attaché in China, being detained by the Japanese authorities. Under-Secretary Butler replied that the British authorities are taking all necessary steps to urgently negotiate with the Japanese authorities to urge his early release. Conservative MP Major-General Knowles asked whether the British, French, and American ambassadors and naval commanders in China had recently met in Shanghai to discuss the issue of restoring freedom of navigation for ships of various countries in the Yangtze River, and what the results were and what measures would be taken. Under-Secretary Butler immediately provided a written reply, saying, "The British, French, and American ambassadors and naval commanders recently happened to be in Shanghai at the same time and must have taken the opportunity to exchange views on various common issues, but Foreign Secretary Halifax is unaware of any formal meeting of the ambassadors. Regarding British commercial issues on the Yangtze River, Sir Craigie, the ambassador to Japan, continued to negotiate on the 6th of this month." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Yunnan-Burma Railway Construction Plan Is Under Meticulous Consideration by the British</h3>
<p>(London) Moorehead, Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma, replied in writing in the House of Commons today to a question from Conservative Wilson, saying that the proposal for the Yunnan-Burma Railway has been submitted to the Marquis of Zetland, Secretary of State for India and Burma, for consideration, but there is no sufficiently concrete plan for a feasible decision on this proposal. All proposals regarding the connection of the Yunnan-Burma Railway must, of course, be subject to extremely detailed consideration by military advisors to the British government and the governments of India and Burma. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>A Small Island in the North Sea is Fortified by Germany, Strategically Important, and Foreigners are Prohibited from Visiting</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The North German Lloyd shipping company recently issued a notice stating that, having received orders from the government, the island of Helgoland in the German North Sea is prohibited from foreign visitors from today, and therefore the company's ships will no longer sail to the island. Helgoland is a small rocky island with an area of 0.63 square kilometers, located at the confluence of the Elbe and Weser rivers, and is one of Germany's important naval strategic locations. The island originally belonged to Britain, and Germany obtained it from Britain in 1890 in exchange for some territory in East Friesland. Germany then made every effort to develop the island, building fortifications and torpedo boat ports, and it occupied an extremely important position during the European War. The island's fortifications were subsequently restricted by the Treaty of Versailles. In recent years, Germany has again fortified the island. Hitler visited the island in early April of this year. The island's fortification project is currently under major construction, so, with the exception of German tourists who can still visit the island on holidays, people of all countries are generally prohibited.

<h3>France Expands Navy, Adds Fourteen Warships</h3>
<p>(Paris) Naval Minister Campinchi recently issued a ministerial order instructing naval shipyards to begin construction, each with a displacement of 600 tons. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Soviet Union Appoints Two New Deputy Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The People's Committee recently appointed Dekanozov, former Deputy Chairman of the People's Committee, and Kozyrevsky, former Director of the Far East Department of the People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, as Deputy People's Commissars for Foreign Affairs.</p>
<h3>Japan-Germany-Italy Alliance Negotiations Have Not Yet Achieved Concrete Results</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Regarding the issue of strengthening the Anti-Comintern Pact, as far as political figures here know, Japan's recent proposal is mainly based on Germany and Italy's policy of assisting Japan in the Far East. The current negotiations have not yet achieved concrete results. Although the Japanese here have long expressed optimism, in reality, the so-called strengthening plan is still abstract in nature.

<h3>British Foreign Secretary Announces That the Era of Aggression is Over, Any Further Occurrence Will Meet with Significant Resistance, British-Soviet Negotiations Still Have Some Difficulties, and If Germany Repents, They Are Still Willing to Negotiate</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax declared today during a foreign affairs debate in the House of Lords that the British government's desire is to devote the entire strength of the Empire to peace and forcefully stated that the era in which the independence of European countries could be undermined by unilateral action is now over, and anyone attempting to take such action will face broad and resolute resistance. The Foreign Secretary also discussed the issue of the British government's negotiations with other countries, saying that the government has worked hard to study the special circumstances of the countries it has contacted and has tried to make some practical contacts on certain practical issues. As for the discussions currently underway, I regret that I cannot provide details. Regarding Poland, the Foreign Secretary recalled the declaration issued by Prime Minister Chamberlain on April 6 with the agreement of Polish Foreign Minister Beck. The guarantee given to Poland in this declaration and its reciprocal nature, it is hoped that a permanent treaty between the two countries will be concluded soon. The guarantees we have given to Romania and Greece are all unilateral and need no further explanation at this time. The application of these guarantees will be the same as that given to Poland. If the independence of Romania or Greece is clearly threatened, and the Romanian or Greek government believes that it must resist with all the strength of the country, then Britain will step in to help. Regarding Turkey, the first stage of negotiations was successfully completed on May 12. The British government issued a declaration on the compromise reached at that time and is now actively engaged in the continued consultations stipulated in the declaration. I hope to be able to announce the successful conclusion of these consultations to the House of Commons soon (cheers). The friendly and cooperative attitude shown by Turkey in the discussions has greatly satisfied the British government and the entire country. This is truly a good omen for peace in the Mediterranean region and Southeast Europe. As for the Soviet Union, the British government has decided to send a representative from the Foreign Office to Moscow to speed up the British-Soviet negotiations. The actions taken by the British government in recent weeks mark a meaningful starting point for British foreign policy. In general, to the best of our ability, to understand the opinions of other countries and to make other countries understand the opinions of Britain, this is extremely important and must be felt.</p>
<p>Mussolini's Remarks Are Comforting</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary then mentioned the speech given by Mussolini, saying, "In his speech in Turin, Mr. Mussolini said that millions of people are now asking us whether we are on the road to war. In fact, there is no issue that can trigger war." I am very pleased to hear this. However, if such issues are to be resolved through negotiation, both sides must have good intentions, be prepared to accommodate the opinions of others, and have the confidence to abide by their promises to others.</p>
<p>Britain Does Not Hinder Germany's Economy</p>
<p>Next, he mentioned Germany, saying, "We never want to hinder Germany in the economic field, because we know that a prosperous Germany can benefit Europe as a whole. The only desire of the British government is to use its full strength to seek a peaceful solution. However, the era in which the independence of European countries can be undermined by unilateral action is now over, and anyone attempting to take such action will surely face broad and resolute resistance. If the independence of all countries is recognized, then the British government is not only willing but also eager to develop the entire economic situation. This is not only the case for Germany, but also for all other countries in Europe."</p>
<p>The Success of an International Conference Is Uncertain</p>
<p>Regarding the possibility of convening an international conference to seek a solution to the current international situation, the conference itself, regardless of its appeal to natural emotions and impulses, is doubtful whether it can provide any remedy. The events to be considered at the conference are not all demands from Germany. Britain also hopes to adjust demands that are opposed to Germany on the basis of preserving lasting peace. We believe that such events can be resolved through negotiation without resorting to force, because it is difficult to carry on international life as usual without other conditions.</p>
<p>I Dare Not Agree That War is Inevitable</p>
<p>Those who believe that war cannot be avoided, I dare not lightly agree with this. The various complex problems in Europe today can easily lead to war if handled recklessly. Moreover, today there are several people who have full authority to make conflicts more acute. If disputes remain as connected as before, then regardless of who wins or loses the war, or how long the war lasts, I have no doubt about its final outcome. Resistance is inevitable, and the terrible consequences of war are known to all, and the desire of the people of all countries for peace and their willingness to see all disputes resolved through negotiation should be known to all. At this time, if those who hope to resort to force to achieve their goals are once aware of the other side's integrity and still do not feel that resolving the unavoidable difficulties in adjusting demands and adapting to new circumstances through negotiation is a wiser and more beneficial approach, then I can hardly believe it.</p>
<p>Negotiations with the Soviet Union Still Have Difficulties</p>
<p>At the beginning of his speech, Halifax declared, "Regarding our combination with the Soviet Union, I have discussed it with French cabinet members in Paris and Geneva, and I have also had continuous meetings with Maisky, the Soviet ambassador to Britain. As a result, we have put forward a proposal to the Soviet government from Britain and France. In our opinion, this proposal has substantially addressed the points of difficulty that previously arose. However, there are still one or two difficulties to be resolved. Regarding the status of the Baltic countries, we have never attempted to impose guarantees on countries that do not wish to accept guarantees or to take any steps that could in any way prejudice relations with these countries. Our only desire is to maintain their neutrality and prevent them from being invaded. At the same time, we must recognize that from the perspective of the Soviet Union's own security, the Soviet Union cannot be indifferent to the independence of its neighbors. I hope that we can eventually find a way to resolve this difficulty and any other problems that may arise."</p>
<p>British Policy Is Straightforward and Frank</p>
<p>The Foreign Secretary also made the following comments on the general situation: "British policy, in our view, is straightforward and frank, but in the eyes of many thoughtful people in Germany, their feelings may be different, which is probably easy to imagine. I am as shocked by the treatment of the Jews as anyone else. Regardless of Germany's feelings about German-Czech relations after the Munich Conference, I know that there are not a few people who consider the destruction of Czech independence to resolve this problem to be unwise and erroneous. However, I believe that Germans who have this feeling, or who have seen the history of the years after the war, also feel that unless they are prepared to back up their demands with the threat of force, the demands that Germans consider reasonable and just will never be considered by other countries. In fact, the British people have always wanted to reach an understanding with Germany, whenever they considered it possible, that would not only help to resolve special problems but also place the two countries in a secure position of mutual trust. Even today, I think the British people still have this hope. At the same time, I think it should be clarified that the British people, no less than their friends across the Channel, are equally prepared and determined to make all necessary contributions to maintaining their way of life and defending their position in the world."</p>
<p>Doors Are Still Open Everywhere</p>
<p>Halifax went on to say about anti-aggression guarantees and what Germany calls "encirclement," saying that if the leaders of all countries do not intend to use the oppression of superior force to force a solution, then anti-aggression guarantees will never be put into practice. The path to new opportunities that can benefit all parties is still open. In this unstable world, if there is one thing that is certain, it is that Britain and France will never take aggressive actions against the independence and security of any other country, or attack by indirect methods. Lord Snell, who initiated the debate on diplomatic events, said that the government, driven by the situation, has finally accepted the main principle of collective security, but the delay in the establishment of the British-Soviet agreement has at least had a disturbing impact. The situation in the Far East is even more unsatisfactory. He did not want to criticize the Foreign Secretary, but the Foreign Secretary's reply to the appeal made by the Chinese Ambassador Gu Weijun in Geneva was disturbingly lacking in sympathy. Halifax said in his reply that he expected all Spanish foreign troops to withdraw soon. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>British-German Misunderstandings Can Still Be Resolved</p>
<p>It seems that the German nation believes that Britain is no longer willing to establish an understanding with Germany, but this misunderstanding is a dangerous factor in the European situation. In fact, the British nation has in the past sought to establish an understanding with Germany based on a heart of mutual trust, and this is still the case today. Even in the European War and after the end of the war, finding various errors, Britain is willing to take responsibility for them and, thinking that what should be corrected, is eager to correct them, to establish a new era of friendship with the German nation. Before, in early March 1936, after Germany abolished the Locarno Pact, the German authorities stated that the period of various unexpected actions had passed. Also, in March 1938, after the German-Austrian merger, it was declared that there were no more territorial demands in Europe. When it came to September of last year, the Munich Agreement was signed and established, and a solution was found for the Sudetenland issue. Britain and Germany also issued a joint declaration on September 30, proclaiming their desire for peace. At that time, although there was no lack of anxiety among the British nation, it was also felt that Germany's views had never been accepted by Britain, and it also tried to understand them. It is a pity that not long after, the German Jews were mistreated, and the conscience of the people of the world was shaken. Soon after, Germany occupied the Czech Republic by surprise and destroyed its independence. Most people were terrified, and the more they said that this might be the initial method of using force to dominate Europe. Most countries, frightened by this latent crisis, approached each other, which is the norm of human nature. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Germany Criticizes, Italy Welcomes</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Responsible figures here say that British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's speech is the result of certain countries beginning to feel doubts about the anti-aggression front. A certain spokesman said that some countries feel that the anti-aggression policy has a kind of ambiguous state. British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax must think that he should now make Britain's desire for peace shine more brightly. In short, Halifax is trying to make the word "peace" have vitality again. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Berlin newspapers criticized British Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax's comments yesterday expressing their desire to have friendly relations with Germany in a satirical tone, saying that Britain's encirclement policy is completely contrary to these hypocritical comments. If Chamberlain and Halifax truly desire peace, then they must change their plans and match their words with their actions. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The speech given by British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in the British House of Lords yesterday is of great interest to the newspapers here, and they have all given it as much coverage as possible, without any depreciatory remarks, and believe that it has great significance "in principle," and say that Foreign Secretary Halifax's intention is that no matter what the outcome of the current negotiations between Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, the doors for Britain to negotiate with other countries should still be left open. This layer is especially noteworthy. When the Foreign Secretary gave his speech, the members of the House of Lords repeatedly applauded him, which is reasonable. A reporter stationed in London for a certain newspaper also telegraphed that political figures in Britain believe that this speech, since March of this year, that is, since Germany annexed Czechoslovakia, is the first speech that is suitable for reality and has common sense. (Havas, 9th)</p>
<h3>Halifax Meets with Soviet Ambassador, Explains Sending Envoy to Moscow</h3>
<p>(London) Foreign Secretary Halifax met with Soviet Ambassador Maisky this afternoon and stated that due to the current international situation, he could not personally travel to Moscow. Therefore, he has dispatched Mr. Strang, the head of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, to the Soviet Union to assist Ambassador Seeds. The current negotiations will still be presided over by Ambassador Seeds. Well-informed sources commented that the future of Anglo-Soviet negotiations is very optimistic. The British government has decided to satisfy the Soviet Union on the following two points: First, the draft Anglo-French-Soviet mutual assistance agreement, which mentions the spirit of the League of Nations Covenant, will be cancelled due to Soviet opposition. Second, in times of emergency, the three signatory countries do not need to exchange opinions in advance and should immediately implement mutual assistance. Regarding the issue of guarantees for the Baltic states, Britain advocates that the three signatory countries should each unilaterally issue a declaration stating their "vital interests" and that the other two countries should accept them. If these interests are threatened, the other two countries should immediately provide assistance. Based on this, although the mutual assistance agreement does not explicitly mention the Baltic states, the Soviet Union can declare that if these countries are threatened, the Soviet Union's vital interests are also threatened, and Britain and France will have to come to the aid. This approach should satisfy the Soviet Union and be beneficial to the conclusion of the agreement. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Mr. Strang, the head of the Central European Department of the Foreign Office, arrived here this afternoon from Warsaw. He immediately went to the Foreign Office to receive instructions and will go to Moscow before the 11th of this month to assist Ambassador Seeds in the negotiations. At the same time, the British and French governments are maintaining close contact through diplomatic channels. French Ambassador Corbin visited Foreign Secretary Halifax yesterday and met with Foreign Office Under-Secretary Sir Cadogan today. British Ambassador to France Sir Phipps also held talks with French Foreign Minister Bonnet. (Havas, 8th)</p>
<h3>Czech Resistance to Germany Intensifies: One German Police Officer Killed, Conflicts Erupt in Tavern</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency (DNB) issued a message stating: "Last night, in the town of Klatovy, not far west of Prague, a German police officer was shot and killed by an unknown assailant. Afterwards, Neurath, the 'Protector' of Bohemia and Moravia, immediately took all necessary measures, including prohibiting public gatherings, temporarily closing all cinemas, theaters, and other public entertainment venues, and ordering the closure of all public schools due to the incitement of teachers. In addition, residents must keep their windows tightly closed between 8:00 PM and 5:00 AM the next morning. German police will open fire on anyone who opens them without authorization. Furthermore, the chairman and all members of the Klatovy City Council have been dismissed and replaced by a committee. Czech police have been disarmed for dereliction of duty. If the murderer is not apprehended by the 9th of this month, Neurath will take further measures." (Havas, 8th)</p>
<p>Prague: Since the murder of a German police officer in Klatovy, the German authorities have taken the most severe measures and offered a reward of 30,000 crowns for the capture of the murderer. Czech Prime Minister General Elias traveled to Klatovy this morning to investigate the situation. In addition, an incident occurred in a tavern in this city last night. Czech and German customers were chatting in the tavern, using the recent football match between the Czech and German teams as a topic of conversation. The Czech team had won, and the Czechs could not help but show their joy, which angered the Germans. A German soldier in plain clothes drew a pistol but was disarmed by the Czechs. The soldier suffered minor facial injuries. Another German soldier also tried to draw a gun but was also disarmed by the Czechs. German police arrived after hearing the news and immediately arrested several Czechs and sealed off the tavern. After this incident, the Czech nation was very agitated. The German authorities have taken various measures to maintain order. (Havas, 9th)</p>

<h3>Britain and America's Emphasis on Peaceful Means Sets a Good Example for the World: President Roosevelt's Toast at the Banquet for the British King, Expected Further Cooperation Between the Two Countries to Protect Interests in the Pacific</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt hosted a grand banquet at the White House last night to entertain the King and Queen of England. During the banquet, President Roosevelt first gave a welcome speech, stating: "Our two countries have contributed greatly to world civilization and human welfare, and the relationship between us is worthy of being a model. There are no fortifications along our borders, we have no fear of aggression, and we do not compete in armaments. I recall the dispute over the sovereignty of Canton Island and Enderbury Island in the Pacific, which was resolved through friendly negotiations, establishing a system of joint rule for a period of fifty years. This is an example of abandoning force and valuing peaceful methods. If all countries in the world could imitate this, the international situation would be stabilized, and mankind could live in a happy, prosperous, and peaceful world." (Havas)</p>
<p>The King replied, thanking the President for the kind invitation and welcome, and said that he and the Queen were deeply moved by the hospitality in Washington. He hoped to spend a pleasant and fulfilling time during his stay in the United States. He extended warm greetings from Canada, a neighbor and friend of the United States, and expressed the highest sincerity and dedication on behalf of Britain, wishing President Roosevelt good health and happiness. He firmly believed that the United States would continue its history, distinguished by order, progress, and prosperity, just like the past history of the United States. He further wished that the two great nations would continue to move forward in a peaceful world, following friendly paths. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) At the grand banquet for the British King and the American President at the White House last night, the King and the President both stood up and raised their glasses to each other, vowing to strengthen the ties between Britain and the United States and work for world peace. At that time, the President further explained the cooperation between Britain and the United States in the Far East. Roosevelt used the joint management of the two Pacific islands by Britain and the United States as an example, stating that he hoped that all countries could resolve disputes through peaceful means. After the President's remarks, non-official sources predicted that Britain and the United States would cooperate more closely to establish a more stable balance of power in the Pacific. General observers believe that the President's remarks today indicate that Britain and the United States will further discuss various issues between the two countries in the Pacific. These issues will include: Maintaining the Open Door Policy in China, protecting the Philippines, guaranteeing the trade routes from the United States to the East Indies, defending Australia, and developing Pacific aviation routes. It is widely believed that the interests of the United States in the Pacific are expanding, and the US government will discuss various rights and interests in the Far East with the British side. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Diplomatic circles today firmly believe that the King and Queen's visit to the United States can inspire the democratic spirit of the Americas and encourage the American republics to continue to evolve along the traditional republican lines. Diplomatic circles also believe that the King and Queen's unprecedented entry into the American frontier shows that Britain and the United States intend to deepen their relationship based on friendship and mutual interests. This policy is usually referred to as "parallel," but in a technical sense, it is not an alliance. From the perspective of the grand vision of the Western Hemisphere, this policy means that Britain and the United States will develop naval policies in parallel and intend to continue to support the Monroe Doctrine, as they did when the doctrine was announced in 1823. Thus, the Latin American countries under the protection of the British and American navies will continue to receive a defensive shield to resist any aggression. This shield to protect the Western Hemisphere may extend beyond the American republics, because President Roosevelt advocates that the United States cannot stand idly by if Canada is invaded. Therefore, the United States must extend its defense to the Pacific Northwest, Alaska, and the Pacific. Furthermore, the King and Queen's visit to the United States comes after the signing of the Anglo-American reciprocal treaty, which guarantees a permanent "most-favored-nation" commercial system for Latin America and provides a substantial guarantee of the principle of free exchange in most of the world. (Associated Press, 9th)</p>
<h3>Unprecedented Grandeur of the Welcome Ceremony</h3>
<p>(Washington) King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England arrived at Washington Station yesterday from Niagara Falls. President Roosevelt greeted them with a democratic and sincere greeting, saying, "How are you?" The American people expressed their welcome with loud shouts, and the military fired salutes in salute. After the King and Queen got off the special train, they walked on a blue-and-white star carpet to the reception room inside the station. Naval officers standing on both sides saluted with their guns. Those waiting in the reception room included the President and his wife and many high-ranking officials. Although the form of the welcome emphasized diplomatic etiquette, the shouts of the crowd were incessant. When the King arrived at the reception room, the President said, "How are you? I am very happy to see you." The King smiled and exchanged a few words of greeting, but his voice was very low and difficult for others to hear. The President then sincerely stepped forward and shook hands with the King. Then the King turned around and introduced the Queen to the President and his wife, and they exchanged handshakes. Yesterday, the King wore a gold-colored naval admiral's uniform, the President wore a black morning suit, and the Queen and the First Lady wore blue velvet robes (the blue velvet robes were presented by wool merchants from Britain and the United States). The King, Queen, President Roosevelt, and other officials and ladies then proceeded to the square in front of the station at 12:11 PM yesterday to review the troops, and the 600,000 people standing around immediately shouted loudly. At the same time, the American naval band played the national anthems of Britain and the United States. The King returned the salute by raising his hand, and the President raised his top hat to his chest. In addition, the American artillery fired a 21-gun salute. The crowd surrounding the King was so large that it was almost impossible to move. Afterwards, the King and others took cars to the White House, the President's residence. The crowds gathered along the way were countless. Those seeking profit rented out windows facing the street to spectators for as much as $15 per person. The King's and President's cars were in the front, and the Queen's and First Lady's cars followed behind. Yesterday, the scorching sun was out in full force, and the weather was hot, with the temperature on the streets reaching 89 degrees Fahrenheit. In addition, the car tops were not up, and the people on the roadside were extremely crowded, so the King used a parasol to block the sunlight. While the two heads of state and the most prominent ladies were chatting casually in the car, planes from the army and navy were flying in formation overhead. Soldiers from the army and navy were stationed every four feet along the way, saluting with their guns. Armored vehicles and cavalrymen guarded the front and rear of the car. The King frequently returned the salute to the crowd in the car, and the Queen often raised her parasol. Finally, at 12:50 PM yesterday, the King and Queen arrived at the White House and planned to stay in the Presidential Palace for 36 hours. The King's visit to the White House is a historic first. The King and Queen were accompanied by Secretary of State Hull into the Presidential Reception Room. Those waiting to greet them in the reception room, in addition to the President, included the Vice President and other important government figures, including Senator Pittman, Army Chief of Staff General Craig, Naval Technical Director Admiral Leahy, Undersecretary of State Welles, etc. Today, the King and Queen will meet with British expatriates at the British Embassy, and at the same time, they will meet with important figures from the Senate and House of Representatives at the White House. This morning, the King and Queen will inspect the Washington Naval Shipyard, and then board the President's private yacht to Mount Vernon to pay tribute to President Washington's tomb with wreaths. After dining on the President's private yacht, the King and Queen will return to Washington by car, and then review the militia at Fort Myer and pay tribute to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. Tonight, the King and Queen will host a banquet for the Roosevelts at the British Embassy. At 11:30 PM, they will take a car to New York. At 8:00 AM on Saturday, the King's car will arrive at Ryder's Point, where they will change cars to Hartak Fort, and then take a destroyer from the fort to the top of New York City. Those waiting to greet the King in New York include Mayor LaGuardia, etc. After arriving in New York, the King will be accompanied by the Mayor on a half-hour tour of the streets in a military vehicle to thank the countless New Yorkers for their warm welcome.

<h3>British Military Attaché Spears Detained by Japanese Troops: Detention Site on the Ping-Sui Railway Line, Japanese Side Claims Right to Detain for Questioning</h3>
<p>The North China communication of the Tzu Lin Bao dated June 2 states that Colonel Spears, the British military attaché, set out from Chongqing to travel in China. He was arrested by the Japanese authorities when he arrived at the Japanese army's front line. The newspapers here have criticized this incident. As of today, the newspapers know the following:</p>
<p>The British Embassy here had predicted some time ago that Colonel Spears had left Chongqing two months ago, was traveling in the Chinese-controlled area, was expected to arrive in North China soon, and planned to arrive in the Western Hills guerrilla area, less than ten miles from Mentougou, the Japanese army's forward outpost west of Beiping, but had to turn back due to the fighting between the guerrillas and the Japanese army. However, Colonel Spears managed to send a message stating that he would take another route, namely, the Pingzhang Railway further north. Therefore, Lieutenant Cooper, an interpreter at the British Embassy, was sent to travel along the railway, hoping to contact Colonel Spears. Before Lieutenant Cooper set off, he visited the Japanese authorities in Beiping to apply for travel permits for himself and Colonel Spears. The Japanese authorities said that Lieutenant Cooper's travel permit would be issued later, but they refused to issue Colonel Spears' travel permit, because Colonel Spears had not yet obtained a Japanese travel permit, and even then, it was not necessary. Therefore, Lieutenant Cooper did not obtain a travel permit and set off along the Zhangjiakou Railway. After that, there was no news of him. Five days later, on the 30th, the "Xinmin Bao," controlled by the Japanese, published a telegram stating that the Japanese garrison in Shuangshu Village, south of the Xiahuayuan on the Pingsui Railway, had captured a suspicious foreigner in the local Catholic Church. The person was ragged and looked like a rogue. Because Shuangshu Village is under the jurisdiction of Zhangjiakou, the captured person was handed over to the Zhangjiakou Japanese Military Police Department to determine his nationality and inquire about his itinerary. The foreigner claimed that he had close ties with General Chiang Kai-shek and was a military attaché from a third country, not a Communist. He had traveled north from Chongqing via Kunming and Hanoi. Because of the bravery of the Japanese army, he had sneaked into Chahar from Hebei. Before arriving in Hebei, he had seen the Japanese army fighting in Shanxi. The Zhangjiakou Japanese Military Police Department is continuing to investigate this foreigner. On the day this news was published, the Japanese spokesman knew about the matter, but when more telegrams were received, he admitted it, but refused to confirm or deny that the arrested foreigner was a British military attaché. Foreign reporters questioned him, and the spokesman angrily replied that the Japanese army had full authority to detain and question foreigners passing through enemy lines in order to extract information from them. The British Embassy authorities are convinced that the suspicious foreigner must be Colonel Spears. One afternoon, Assistant Chinese Secretary Lamb and Major Daraman of the British garrison in Tianjin, after some delay, obtained the necessary permission from the Japanese commander and went to Zhangjiakou to meet Colonel Spears and search for Lieutenant Cooper, because they had not heard from Lieutenant Cooper after he set off. The Japanese spokesman also confirmed that the person arrested was a British military attaché, and the reason he gave for the arrest was that the situation was very special when Colonel Spears arrived at the Japanese front line, and the Japanese army had full authority to treat this person as a suspicious person. (It should be mentioned that Colonel Spears had a passport with him, according to what is known.) The spokesman added that the case was very complicated and that the Beiping Japanese Military Command was still awaiting an official report. Jinhua communication: After the Japanese army occupied the three prefectures of Hangzhou, Jiaxing, and Huzhou, the entire western Zhejiang has become a guerrilla area. In order to plunder, the Japanese army ordered the puppet organizations in western Zhejiang to collect various donations and taxes, and to implement a public sale of opium. The main points are described below:</p>
<p>Consolidated Tax: The consolidated tax is the income of the puppet "Renovation Government," and is collected by the Puppet Government's General Taxation Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. Tax branches are set up in each district. The tax is levied at 7.5% of the value of the goods. The names of the goods are not detailed.</p>
<p>Stamp Duty on Tobacco and Alcohol:</p>
<p>This is a provincial tax, collected by the Zhejiang Provincial Stamp Duty on Tobacco and Alcohol Office set up by the puppet provincial government. The tax rates are not detailed.</p>
<p>Tin Foil Tax:</p>
<p>Tin foil is mostly produced in Shaoxing and Hangzhou. The Shaoxing products are the best, followed by Hangzhou products. The puppet provincial government has now established the Jiangzhe Tin Foil Special Tax General Bureau in Hangzhou, and a collection office in Shanghai, with a monthly revenue of 6,000 yuan, which is delivered to the puppet Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Public Sale of Opium:</p>
<p>The puppet provincial government has established a Prohibition of Opium General Bureau, and each county has established a Prohibition of Opium Branch Bureau. In name, it prohibits opium, but in reality, it is a public sale. The Prohibition of Opium Branch Bureau in each county is concurrently managed by the puppet county government or the puppet police station. The prohibition of opium in Hangzhou City and County is handled by the puppet General Bureau. The income from various public sales fees is distributed according to provinces and counties. The details are as follows: (A) Registration fee for opium smokers, one dime per application. (B) Opium smoker license fee, 1.5 yuan per quarter. (The application and license fees are provincial income in the General Bureau and county income in the Branch Bureau.) (C) Opium stamp duty. The General Bureau has set up opium (called "tobacco cessation medicine" by the puppet authorities) manufacturing plants and monopoly sales offices. In addition to collecting the prescribed tobacco price, a stamp duty of three yuan is levied on each tael of opium. The stamp is issued by the General Bureau. Two-thirds of the stamp duty revenue is provincial income, and one-third is city and county income. (D) Donation of license certificates for opium distribution stations. Opium distribution stations and sales treatment centers are specially allowed to be established in the location of the provincial and county opium prohibition bureaus. Each distribution station should at least sell 1,000 taels of opium per month, and pay a monthly donation of 100 yuan for the license certificate, and so on (that is, a donation of 10% of the licensed sales volume is collected for the license certificate). (E) Business license donation for opium sales treatment centers. Each center should pay a business license donation in accordance with its grade every month, with the highest donation amount being 20 yuan. (The above two license certificate donations are provincial income in the General Bureau and county income in the Branch Bureau.) (F) Income from auction of smuggled goods and fines. The proceeds from the sale of confiscated smuggled soil and opium paste, and the fines paid after sentencing, in addition to subsidizing the public expenses of the trial organs and sharing the awards, the rest is the income of the city and county.</p>
<p>Field Tax and Land Price Tax:</p>
<p>The puppet county government compiles and collects field tax. The situation varies from county to county, but most of them are collected by the mu. Because the Japanese puppets only occupy cities and towns, and the four villages are under the control of the guerrillas, the puppet side does not dare to send people to the countryside to urge the collection. Therefore, the field tax income of the puppet county government in each county is very small. The puppet municipal government of Hangzhou City has been preparing to collect the land price tax for the first half of the 28th year since April 16.</p>
<p>Empty House Rent:</p>
<p>After the Japanese occupied various cities and towns, most of the people fled abroad. The Japanese puppets came up with the idea of ​​organizing empty house registration and implementing empty room rentals. Hangzhou City stipulated that the period from March 1 to April 30 was the registration period for empty houses, and the implementation of empty room rentals would begin on May 1. According to the results of the survey of existing houses compiled by the puppet Hangzhou Municipal Government, there are: 850 households of shops, 5,551 households of residential houses, and 3,815 empty rooms, a total of 10,125 households. The number of empty houses is far more than the number of shops and residential houses. The income from empty room rentals must be considerable. It is estimated that there are three types of income from empty room rentals: 1. Empty room registration fee, 50 cents per household, 2. Application fee for renting empty rooms, 2 yuan per application, 3. Rent, estimated by the shop and residential house valuation committee, paid monthly, and one month's rent must be prepaid when entering the house.</p>
<p>Tea Bowl Donation:</p>
<p>There are many tea houses, large and small, in the towns and villages of western Zhejiang. Tea houses also operate gambling dens, brothels, and opium dens, so the business is not bad, and the income from tea bowl donations is also considerable. For example, the donation rate for tea bowls in the Pingdiao District of Hangzhou County is divided into five grades: Grade A is 4 yuan per month, Grade B is 3 yuan per month, Grade C is 2 yuan per month, Grade D is 1 yuan per month, and Grade E is 50 cents per month.</p>
<p>Shop and Residential House Donation:</p>
<p>Shops pay 15% of the rent each month, and residential houses pay 10%. It was originally stipulated that the owner should pay 70% and the tenant 30%, but in practice, most of it is borne by the tenant. In addition, the organs below the puppet county government in each county have many kinds of miscellaneous taxes, including cargo tax, slaughter tax, self-defense donation, street light donation, ship license fee, good citizen certificate fee (now changed to household registration certificate), vehicle donation, vehicle license fee, and beggar donation, etc. The situation varies from place to place, but it is nothing more than exploitation as much as possible, so there is no need to describe them in detail.</p>
<h3>Guerrillas Destroy Puppet Tax Card on the Qinghu Road, Puppet Director Seriously Injured</h3>
<p>Qingpu communication: The Xujing Station on the Qinghu Road west of Shanghai, which was set up by the puppet Qingpu County Government last spring as a "tax card," requires merchants and civilians to pay taxes for transporting goods, and even pedestrians must pay a road maintenance fee of 20 cents. In the past, the Japanese side specially dispatched more than 20 Japanese troops to guard the station together with Qiu Yongsi, the puppet tax collector. Recently, due to the Japanese side's assessment of the active Chinese army west of Shanghai, the Japanese troops were ordered to stay at the Hongqiao Airport at night. On the evening of the 7th, the Wang Department of the guerrillas stationed near Qibao took advantage of the emptiness to attack and completely destroyed the puppet tax card. The puppet tax collectors Qiu Yongsi and others were seriously injured. After the guerrillas completed their mission, they immediately retreated.</p>
<p>The Japanese army stationed in Qingpu ordered Zhu, the puppet propaganda director, to write peace slogans in red and green paper and post them all over the city and in the suburbs. The general meaning is to support Wang Jingwei's peace with Japan.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Flying Over Outside of Zhenhai Port Spontaneously Combusts and Falls into Jintang Sea</h3>
<p>Ningbo communication: People from Jintang talked about, on the morning of the 2nd at about 6 am, a Japanese aircraft, flying over outside of Zhenhai Port, suddenly caught fire and spontaneously combusted. Immediately, the head of the aircraft had blazing flames, the tail smoked, and in an instant it fell into the sea near Jintang, and floated away with the tide without a trace. When the masses saw this situation, they all cheered.</p>

<h3>Currency Shortage Has Not Shaken the Foreign Exchange Market; It is Gradually Calming Down; All Legitimate Needs Are Still Being Supplied; Control Will Continue Once a New Level is Reached</h3>
<p>(Special dispatch from our Hong Kong office, 9th) This morning, the Hong Kong currency price rebounded to 48. General observers said that it is possible to rebound to 50. Financial circles are informed that the government has a proper way to deal with the depreciation of the currency. Authoritative sources said that in the past few weeks, the Chinese currency balance fund has not had any difficulties, and the currency has not been shaken. However, the temporary suspension of control a few days ago was to allow the exchange rate to reach a more suitable economic level in order to balance trade. The same measures were taken in June last year, when the level price was eight pence, and this price was successfully maintained for a year. Now a new level has been discovered and can be firmly supported, which can be deeply believed. After banks such as HSBC restrict the supply of foreign exchange outside the black market, they still supply as much as possible for the legitimate needs of various industries based on orders, aiming to prevent speculators from manipulating the foreign exchange market and Japanese people from arbitrage. At the same time, the Central Bank also supplies statutory foreign exchange as usual. Therefore, since yesterday, the public in Shanghai has been at peace, rumors have subsided, and foreign exchange prices have also stabilized slightly. The details are as follows.</p>
<p>Foreign Exchange Applications Processed as Usual</p>
<p>Foreign banks that operate foreign exchange, such as HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Citibank, and Great Britain, supply foreign exchange to legitimate merchants as usual based on orders, aiming to prevent speculators from manipulating the foreign exchange market and Japanese people from being unable to arbitrage. As for the Central Bank, for all goods imported with government approval, it still supplies the statutory foreign exchange of one shilling and two and a half pence. The Shanghai branch of the Central Bank still handles foreign exchange applications as usual every week. Yesterday was Friday, the day the bank approved and released applications. However, because the review was very strict, the number of approvals was very small.</p>
<p>Truth Revealed, Public Sentiment Stabilized</p>
<p>Since the unprecedented tightening of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market began on the 7th of this month, there have been many rumors in the market, and speculators have taken the opportunity to manipulate and profit. Now that the truth about the restriction of foreign exchange supply has been revealed, the rumors have been proven to be unfounded, and China's foreign exchange fund is still abundant, enough to maintain foreign exchange during the war of resistance. At the same time, the Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee has explained the unreliability of the rumors. Therefore, since yesterday, the public in the market has been at peace, the rumors have subsided, and foreign exchange prices have also stabilized slightly. Yesterday, HSBC's listed exchange rate for the British currency was six and a half pence, and the US currency was twelve yuan and six jiao and two and a half fen, which was the same as the previous day.</p>
<p>Resumption of Supply in Due Course</p>
<p>According to banking sources yesterday, the Hong Kong Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee held a meeting on the 7th of this month to study the sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the Shanghai black market. It is reported that this decision to temporarily suspend assistance to the black market foreign exchange is to prevent Japanese arbitrage and promote trade balance, so as to reduce the import surplus of Shanghai Customs. Once the exchange rate reaches the horizontal line, supply and maintenance will be restored immediately. That is, if someone throws it out, the committee will buy it, and if there is revenue, the committee will sell it, so as to stabilize the black market foreign exchange. The above measures are beneficial to China's wartime finance.</p>
<p>Import Merchants Meet to Discuss Remedies</p>
<p>The sharp contraction of foreign exchange in the black market has a significant impact on the future of import merchants' business. For importers who have ordered goods but have not purchased foreign exchange, the losses are very large. Although the exchange rate has stabilized slightly since yesterday, it is one and a half pence lower compared to before the 7th. It is impossible to predict whether it will be able to return to the state before the 7th in the future. Therefore, an important foreign firm of import merchants held an informal meeting yesterday to discuss remedies for the current tightening of the exchange market. It is heard that they unanimously hope that the Chinese government will quickly maintain it to avoid unexpected losses to importers.</p>
<p>Accurate Ratio Has Not Reached the Level</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that the volatility of the exchange market in this city has returned to calm this morning (9th). As of noon, the stabilization fund had not yet resumed selling foreign exchange through HSBC and Mercantile Bank, because the current accurate exchange rate has not yet fallen to the new level set by the fund. However, the above-mentioned two banks have hinted to customers and other banks that the fund seems to sell foreign exchange when the British exchange rate shrinks to six pence and five yuan, and the US exchange rate reaches twelve yuan, sixty-two and a half yuan. At the time of closing, the two exchange rates were still zero six two higher than the new level, and the fund had the image of re-intervening and selling foreign exchange. The market has been guaranteed again, and many buyers have also stopped or reduced their foreign exchange applications. At that time, the fund's foreign exchange allocation will be restricted and reserved for later. The Chinese government has not yet made a clear statement on this aspect. This morning, the yen was stronger in the local exchange market, with exchange shops buying at nine jiao and nine fen and five yuan and selling at one yuan and five fen.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Maintains Creditworthiness and Unifies the Type E Bonds to be Drawn Today for a Total Principal Repayment of 2.08 Million Yuan, Payable on July 31</h3>
<p>In order to maintain creditworthiness, the Ministry of Finance has decided that the government will continue to subsidize the revolving repayment of principal and interest of bonds guaranteed by customs duties, which will be paid on July 3</p>
<p>After the bank and its entrusted Bank of China and Bank of Communications make the payment, the new 　　　　 Yesterday, it was learned from the National Debt Fund Management Committee that the lottery of Type A, B, C, and D bonds of the unified public debt has been held separately. As for Type E bonds, eight lottery tickets will be drawn at the Bankers Association at 10:00 am today, with a total principal repayment of 2.08 million yuan. Letters have been sent to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers Association, the local court, etc. to send personnel to monitor at that time.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador's Trip to Chongqing is Unbelievable</h3>
<p>British Ambassador to China Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, in addition to attending a luncheon at the British Consulate on the 8th to celebrate the birthday of King George VI, also held a garden party at the ambassador's private residence on Dunxin Road in the afternoon to entertain consuls from various countries and extend their congratulations. Regarding the rumor that the British ambassador will leave Shanghai in mid-June, according to sources at the British Embassy, the ambassador has no intention of going to Chongqing, and no decision has been made yet. This statement is not credible.</p>
<h3>The Public Works Department Investigates the American Literature Strike and Plans to Implement Mediation to Avoid Escalation of Disputes</h3>
<p>The American Literature Silk Weaving Factory on Xiaoshabo Road in this city has a total of more than 300 male and female workers. The relationship between labor and management has always been harmonious. Recently, the factory suddenly announced on the morning of the 7th of this month that it would lay off more than 100 workers and close the factory gate to prevent workers from entering the factory to work. When all the workers heard the news, they were panicked. They immediately petitioned the factory to request permission to resume work, but to no avail. The workers then gathered at a certain place to discuss and elected five representatives to petition the Public Works Department on the afternoon of the 8th, requesting impartial assistance. The director of the Industrial Section received them. The workers' representatives first stated the process of being laid off and made two requests: (1) Restore the work of the laid-off workers, and (2) During the shutdown period, the factory will provide subsidies. The Public Works Department agreed to investigate and handle it. Yesterday morning, the bureau sent Gu Bingchen to the factory to investigate, and it is heard that it will convene both parties for mediation to avoid escalation of the situation and affect public security.</p>
<h3>Copper Coins Have Been Collected and Exhausted; The National Government Decides to Issue Copper Subsidiary Coin Vouchers; Traitorous Merchants Collect and Sell to a Certain Party; The Central Bank Suspends Supply to Businesses and the Public; Temporary Inconvenience for Small Change</h3>
<p>In view of the soaring price of copper overseas and the profiteering of traitorous merchants who secretly transport copper coins for export, the Ministry of Finance, in order to preserve currency materials and military industrial materials, has ordered the customs to strictly investigate and deal with the matter. In addition, because traitorous merchants are used to buy copper coins to supply a certain party with military industrial materials, which not only disrupts finance and destroys currency policy, but also affects the War of Resistance. If they are not severely punished, it is not enough to punish traitors and deter them. Therefore, it is specifically stipulated that any traitorous merchant who buys one-cent or half-cent copper coins and old copper yuan will be confiscated and confiscated in full if it is found that they are resold to others or smuggled for export, and will be punished for disrupting finance in accordance with the regulations on punishing traitors. Since the implementation, the smuggling of copper yuan has disappeared. However, Shanghai, because it belongs to a fallen area, is beyond the power of the government under special circumstances, and the Jianghai Customs is forced to be unable to implement the order. General traitorous merchants take advantage of the environment to collect huge amounts of money and sell it to a certain party, which is loaded on wheels and exported from Hongkou. This has been going on for a long time, and the number is alarming, so that one-cent and half-cent copper coins and old copper yuan in the market are collected and exhausted. At the same time, the Central Bank, in view of this situation, has suspended the transport of new subsidiary coins to Shanghai for supply. All industries are affected by the purchase of good merchants, and all transactions are very inconvenient. They have no choice but to use stamps and banknotes to replace copper coins for circulation. Public buses have re-issued and circulated the coins that were previously issued as substitutes for copper yuan. Each tram hopes that passengers will bring copper coins to purchase tickets when taking the bus. As for the beggars on the road, they are also affected by the lack of copper yuan. It is heard that the listed price of copper yuan in the money industry is 300 copper coins for 100 copper coins, but the actual market price is 2,500 wen for copper yuan and 95 copper coins for subsidiary coins.</p>
<p>Difficult to Convert</p>
<p>According to the impression obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter in the market yesterday, some people exchanged a one-jiao subsidiary coin voucher for seven fen of copper subsidiary coins at a cigarette shop, and some used one yuan of national currency to exchange for 270 copper coins. Those who refuse to exchange for masters and guests because of the lack of copper subsidiary coins are also common. What I saw in the vegetable market was that I had to buy something worth more than five cents to get change in copper subsidiary coins. The same is true for shops.</p>
<p>Walking on Foot</p>
<p>Tram public words, also because of the lack of copper subsidiary coins, the ticket seller will politely refuse to board passengers who do not bring copper subsidiary coins. Passengers in this situation can only walk on foot, but the journey is long and those who are not used to walking are very hard. Public buses have used the previous price chips for circulation, so they can still cope.</p>
<p>What Was Seen in the Market</p>
<p>Because of the above situation, the inconvenience and pain felt by the citizens is very great. Most shops use stamps as substitutes to cope with customers, and some print a kind of price voucher to replace chips below one jiao for circulation. However, most shops still cannot solve the problem of finding change, and their business is also affected accordingly. Small vendors are the worst, and beggars are even more affected because no one gives alms.</p>
<p>New Vouchers Will Be Issued</p>
<p>Finally, according to the exploration of the Datong News Agency reporter, the government has decided to issue three kinds of subsidiary coin vouchers of one fen, two fen, and five fen to meet the needs of Shanghai. It is found that in various places in eastern Zhejiang, due to the lack of copper subsidiary coins, the Zhejiang Local Bank has long issued three kinds of subsidiary coin vouchers of one fen, two fen, and five fen to meet the needs of the market. Therefore, this move is not difficult. The saying that copper yuan vouchers will be issued is not true.</p>

<h3>Anti-British Movement Rises; Britain Makes Strong Negotiations; The Case Has Been Presented to Miura in Person by the British Consul-General; The Protest Against the Dinggeller Case Was Only Delivered Yesterday</h3>
<p>The strike at the Luen Cheung Dyeing and Weaving Company in Pudong is becoming increasingly deadlocked due to the malicious instigation of a certain party. In Pudong, the "New Shanghai Labor Anti-British Alliance" was discovered again, expanding anti-British activities, and forcing ignorant female workers to parade again. Japanese troops are stationed in front of the new Luen Cheung factory, and good workers are unable to return to the factory to resume work. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Forcing Workers to Participate in Parades</p>
<p>The British-owned Luen Cheung Dyeing and Weaving Company, after firing worker Gu Jingen, which caused a strike, a certain party took the opportunity to instigate, encourage in every possible way, and organize so-called "Strike Committee" and "China Workers' Alliance Committee", etc., to buy ignorant workers with money, obstruct the resumption of work, and attempt to incite an anti-British movement, resulting in the long-term unresolved strike. It is learned that in Pudong, there is recently a so-called "New Shanghai Labor Anti-British Alliance" openly raising the anti-British banner and actively engaging in activities. In addition to sabotaging the resumption of work at Luen Cheung, it also conspires to incite workers at the Gu Zhong factory and other British-owned factories to join the strike. Its ulterior motives directly use workers as its victims.</p>
<p>Forcing Workers to Participate in Parades</p>
<p>The pseudo "Great People's League", etc., in order to curry favor with a certain party and show off their achievements, have repeatedly lured Luen Cheung workers to hold demonstrations. Most workers understand the righteousness and refuse to participate. Only a small number of ignorant female workers are driven by them. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at about 1:00 pm, the pseudo-party forced ignorant workers to parade again. They started from Dongchang Road and went east through Xinma Road, Laiyidu, Yangjiadu, and then returned to Dongchang Road, distributing absurd leaflets along the way. Pseudo-police assisted. When workers did not want to parade and temporarily withdrew, they were forcibly prevented. Therefore, the expressions of the workers during the parade were extremely reluctant.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Stationed at the Luen Cheung Factory Gate</p>
<p>Since the conflict at the Luen Cheung Printing Factory, the death of the British engineer Ingler from serious injuries, and the shooting of male workers by pseudo-soldiers, all workers in the two factories have been forced to leave. Japanese naval marines are now stationed in front of the new factory gate, and pseudo-soldiers are guarding outside the old factory gate. Traffic inside and outside the factory has been blocked. General good workers are eager to resume work, but they are unable to enter the factory due to environmental restrictions. It is not known how the strike will end.</p>
<p>British Consul Visits Miura to Negotiate</p>
<p>The Mainland News reported that the British staff member of Luen Cheung Company, Ingler, was fatally stabbed. The British side will submit a formal written protest to the Japanese authorities this morning (9th). The protest has been drafted and was originally scheduled to be submitted yesterday (8th), but it was postponed due to the celebration of the King's birthday. The British authorities said yesterday that they could not disclose the content of the protest. According to news received last night, British Consul-General Phillips visited</p>
<p>Japanese Consul-General Miura</p>
<p>Directly raised verbal negotiations to oppose the Japanese side fueling anti-British disturbances in Pudong. Phillips spoke of the Japanese army's endorsement of labor anti-British disturbances and the incident that occurred at the Luen Cheung Printing Factory in Bailianjing, Pudong, yesterday morning, saying that although the strike at the Bailianjing Printing Factory had been resolved, Japanese people in plain clothes with weapons prevented Chinese workers hired by the British side from returning to the factory, and then asked Miura to take measures to prevent the Japanese from repeating it.</p>
<p>This Kind of Activity</p>
<p>According to earlier news yesterday, Japanese people in plain clothes opened fire to forcibly prevent workers from resuming work, and a Chinese bystander was injured and sent to the Nanshi Hospital. The Japanese side did not mention Phillips' visit to Miura at the reception for reporters last night, but the Japanese naval spokesman said that there was no shooting incident at the Luen Cheung Printing Factory before. "The Japanese authorities are now widely on alert to maintain peace and order in the area." Regarding the anti-British parade that Japanese soldiers participated in yesterday morning, he had no news. Or asked in recent weeks, whether there have been any demonstrations of a fundamentally anti-British nature. The spokesman replied that the striking workers may have demonstrations, but he has no news about this matter. Someone asked if the Japanese authorities would take action to prevent the striking workers from demonstrating. The spokesman replied that, as previously stated, the Japanese army does not mediate between labor and management, but only maintains peace and order. The "Chinese Word Forest Daily" reported that Ingler, a British supervisor at the Luen Cheung Textile Factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, fought with Japanese sailors in the factory on Tuesday morning, suffered serious injuries, and died on Wednesday morning. Last night (8th) according to</p>
<p>British Consulate</p>
<p>An official claimed that the British Consulate authorities would lodge a very strong protest with the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Miura regarding Ingler's death. Strong negotiations have been made with the Japanese authorities regarding the anti-British demonstrations in Pudong and the threats to Luen Cheung Company's employees by armed groups, but the protest related to Ingler's death has not yet been filed.</p>
<p>Representatives of Foreign Factories Called to a Meeting</p>
<p>The English-language "Great American Evening News" reported that representatives of foreign companies with property in Pudong yesterday (8th) went to the Pudong Japanese Marine Corps Headquarters to hold a meeting with Captain Noji of the team. Noji verbally asked the representatives to provide the scheduled time for their employees to travel to and from various factories, so that the Japanese Marine Corps could fully protect these workers. Noji had convened this meeting before the Ingler conflict. At yesterday's meeting, he used a translator to talk to the representatives about suggestions to better protect them during labor disputes, and finally asked the participants to drink beer for the King's birthday. It is heard that the representatives asked Noji to notify them in writing of the information he obtained in detail. After obtaining the detailed report, they will consider the procedures for arranging cooperation with the Japanese side. Ingler's funeral will be held at the Hongqiao Road Cemetery this afternoon. Regarding Ingler's death, the British Consulate authorities have not yet filed a protest, but once all the information they have obtained has been verified, it will be filed.</p>
<h3>Tian Huzi's Troops Recapture Jiufeng; Thousands of Stonemasons Return to Their Hometowns; Japanese Troops Dare Not Easily Re-invade</h3>
<p>According to people from Qingpu, after Yuan Yingjie's troops of the guerrillas in the Qingsong Road, Tianmashan, Hengshan, and Xiaokunshan areas were ordered to transfer to the Sujia Road to fight, the defense of the area was empty, and traitors used the line to inform the Songjiang Japanese Military Police Corps, which sent teams to occupy the nine mountains including Tianmashan, Hengshan, Xiaokunshan, Sheshan, Xueshan, Fenghuangshan, Kugongshan, Beiganshan, and Xiaoshan, and forced the original thousands of stonemasons to stop working and block the mountains. Later, the Songjiang defense was empty, and the Japanese soldiers were transferred back. Another gangster, Qu Xueming, was appointed to organize the pseudo "Jiufeng Self-Defense Corps" to guard for the Japanese army. Before long, Zhao was arrested and imprisoned for bribery, and the pseudo "army" of seventy or eighty people all disintegrated and fled. The Japanese army also had no surplus power to send troops to station. The Chinese military authorities detected the situation and recently ordered Tian Huzi's troops of the guerrillas in the western suburbs of Qingpu to advance at full speed and have completely recovered the mountains. The thousands of stonemasons who had been unemployed for several months, led by the mountain owners, continued to return to the mountains to work. They were all overjoyed when they returned to their hometowns. As of now, the Japanese army has not dared to easily invade the guerrilla army that recovered the foot of Tianmashan.</p>
<h3>Tightening of Foreign Exchange Affects Various Industries in Shanghai; Coal Prices Rise Starting Yesterday; Sources Become Scarce; The Shipment of Foreign Rice to Shanghai Will Inevitably Increase Prices</h3>
<p>Recently, due to the tightening of foreign exchange and the sharp shrinkage of the first currency, various industries in the city have increased the cost of goods purchased from abroad, and the cost of water has doubled. In order to maintain their capital, they have all increased prices since yesterday, or will hold meetings to increase prices. However, all citizens of the city are suffering from high living standards and are complaining incessantly. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Coal Prices Rise</p>
<p>The coal market is affected by the tightening of foreign exchange, and the difference between buying and selling prices is relatively large. The cost of water is high, and the sale of coal once shipped to Shanghai is bound to suffer. The market is bullish and everyone is watching silently and temporarily does not leave the warehouse, so the spot goods are scarce. The Market Evaluation Committee held a meeting the day before yesterday and decided that the price of Indian lump coal is 43 yuan per ton, Kaiping coal is 41 yuan per ton, Hongji coal is 48 yuan per ton, Kaiping scraps are 36 yuan and 5 jiao for the first grade, and 28 yuan for the second grade. The above prices are all market transactions, as for coal</p>
<p>Hardware Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Hardware Parts Industry Association, because the first currency has shrunk sharply, the sales price of hardware such as hinges and other parts ordered by the industry from Europe and the United States has increased. The Evaluation Committee of the company has set a meeting at the Tianjin Road Clubhouse at 1:00 pm today to increase prices and maintain capital. It is heard that important cases such as increasing the sales price of various hardware parts will be discussed at that time. The Hardware Industry Association is also scheduled to hold a meeting of all members at the clubhouse at 4:00 pm today.</p>
<p>Affects Foreign Rice</p>
<p>A reporter from New Sound News learned from a rice leader yesterday that, due to the tightening of foreign exchange, the sales prices of domestic and foreign goods have been very different. Some rice merchants in the city, in order to plan ahead, have entrusted Dafu Foreign Bank to order 200,000 bags of Saigon foreign rice (2,000 tons). The price of each large bag is 19 yuan and 4 jiao. However, since the tightening of foreign exchange and the high cost of water, the price of foreign rice will inevitably increase at that time, which will affect the people's food. As for the second batch of foreign rice, the transaction has not yet been completed. Now, due to the foreign exchange relationship, the telegraph contact has been temporarily suspended.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Brass Band</h3>
<p>The Public Works Department Music Team is scheduled to hold a brass band concert at Zhaofeng Park from 5:00 pm to 6:30 pm on the 10th of this month (weather permitting). The program includes seven items.</p>
<h3>Japan Protests Hanging National Flags; The French Concession Authorities Have Replied; According to the Spokesman, the Content of the Reply is Very Ordinary</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of hanging national flags in the French Concession, the Japanese side protested to the French authorities and requested that the hanging be stopped. It is learned that the French Concession authorities have replied to the Japanese side's request. According to the spokesman on the 8th, the French authorities have indeed replied, but the content is very ordinary and does not include any special details.</p>

<h3>Hai Cheng Wheel Forced to Return to Hong Kong; The British Authorities Attach Great Importance; Blocked by Japanese Warships Outside Quanzhou for Four Days; A British Army Team Boards the Ship for Negotiations to No Avail; It is Heard that the British Ambassador to Japan Has Filed a Negotiation</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese naval authorities hindered third-country ships from sailing in inland rivers, such as Xinghua, Quanzhou, Haidou, and Qidong, after nine ports, shipping companies from various countries have reported to the authorities that ships sailing on the Beisha Line (Qidong Haimen) have been forced to change the name of the closing port to continue to send ships. However, the Xinghua Quanzhou route, British Swire Company, had planned to send the Niuzhuang wheel to sail, but it was suspended due to Japanese obstruction and changed to Tianjin. A reporter from New Sound News learned from the shipping industry yesterday that the British Jardine Matheson Company's Hai Cheng wheel, with a gross tonnage of 2,080 tons and a net tonnage of 1,280 jiao tons, sailed from Hong Kong to Quanzhou with cargo and 56 passengers. On May 26, it was blocked by a Japanese warship outside Quanzhou, preventing the ship from entering Quanzhou to unload cargo. The shipowner telegraphed the British warship for assistance, and the British warship Da Meng (transliteration) sailed to protect it, and a small team of British navy was stationed on the Hai Cheng wheel, but repeated negotiations were ineffective. The Hai Cheng docked outside Quanzhou for four days and returned to Hong Kong. It is heard that the British authorities attach great importance to this matter, and the British government has ordered the British ambassador to Japan to file a negotiation with Japan on the case of Japan blocking China's inland rivers.</p>
<h3>Sources涌来; Prices Fall Back; Ordering Foreign Rice is No Longer Necessary; The Sharp Shrinkage of Foreign Exchange is Not Very Relevant</h3>
<p>The other day, due to the sharp shrinkage of the exchange rate, it was said that foreign rice was difficult to continue to order and that hoarders took the opportunity to absorb it, and prices rose again. The shrinkage of the exchange rate made it very uneconomical to order foreign rice, so it is true that it will be difficult to continue to order foreign rice in the future. However, recently, there is sufficient rice in Shanghai, and the sources of production areas are very smooth. For example, yesterday, five or six boats arrived at Hexia, and trains and small boats transported more than 5,000 bags of rice to Suzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan and other places. Moreover, the weather is hot, and hoarders are deeply afraid that the stored rice will heat up and be damaged, so they are mostly out of the cage. The market transaction suddenly shows a situation of oversupply, so rice prices have turned down. Changshu white japonica rice has fallen back to 17 yuan and 3 jiao. Judging from the current situation of sufficient storage and arrival, it is not necessary to order foreign rice. Although foreign exchange is tight, it has no significant impact on rice prices. Shanghai citizens' food will never be in danger.</p>
<h3>Wang Jingwei to Cross to Japan: Chen Bijun, Gao Zongwu, and Japanese Nationals to Accompany Him; Will Form a Puppet "Central Government" with Japanese Merchants</h3>
<p>Ever since Wang Jingwei was officially wanted by the National Government, his whereabouts have been exceptionally secretive, leading to conflicting rumors for months. However, according to reliable reports, Wang arrived in Shanghai in early June and has not left since, remaining for over a month. The information obtained is detailed below:</p>
<p>Wang's Residence</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Shanghai, Wang initially resided in Doihara's residence in Jiangwan, under special protection from the Japanese. Later, he moved back to his old residence on Avenue Haig in Shanghai. Wang's old residence, along with the mansions of Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Wang Boqun, etc., are all within the extraterritorial road construction area. The residences of Sun, Wu, and Wang had long been occupied by the Japanese, but Wang's residence alone remained untouched, indicating a long-standing tacit understanding between Wang and the Japanese. The walls of his residence have been heightened for defense. Within a perimeter of thirty yards around the residence, pedestrians are not allowed to pass, and multiple wooden sentry posts have been established, guarded by rotating shifts of security personnel. Inside the perimeter, in addition to a squad of Japanese military police, there are also Wang's personal bodyguards, totaling 150 guards inside and outside. Each guard receives a salary ranging from thirty-five to one hundred and twenty yuan. Protection is extremely strict. Wang frequently travels between his residences in Jiangwan and western Shanghai. Each time he leaves, four cars are deployed in front and behind. Generally, when Wang is in contact with Japanese personnel and puppets from the northern and southern puppet organizations, he stays in Jiangwan. When he is in contact with his confidants and other parties, he stays in western Shanghai. Accompanying Wang to Shanghai are his wife, Chen Bijun, and Chen Bijun's nephew, Chen Chunpu. Chen was originally a commissioner and education director of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission but was dismissed by the central government for siding with Wang. Chen's decision to come to Shanghai with Wang is certainly to carry out Chen Bijun's wishes, but his duty is specifically to handle intelligence, providing the Japanese with various important Chinese information. His reward from the Japanese is fifty thousand yuan per month.</p>
<p>Facilitating Figures</p>
<p>On the Japanese side, those facilitating Wang's collusion with the Japanese are Doihara and Harada Kageaki. Doihara and Wang became acquainted while living in Tokyo and have a deep friendship. On the puppet side, there are Chen Qun and Chen Zhongfu. Chen and others in the puppet group still claim to be members of the Kuomintang and have party ties with Wang. On Wang's side, there are Gao Zongwu and Zhou Fohai. In addition, the German side is also facilitating the connection between Wang and the Japanese. Wang's confidants, such as Chen Gongbo, were not absolutely sympathetic to Wang's actions, but Chen has always held pro-German views. Therefore, due to the instigation of the German side, they did not dissent. The rumor that Chen has broken away from Wang is just a smokescreen put out by Chen himself.</p>
<p>About to Cross to Japan</p>
<p>Wang has been in Shanghai for over a month, with Harada and others following him closely day and night. In addition to key Japanese figures, those who have met with Wang include Wang Kemin, Liang Hongzhi, Wen Zongyao, and Chen Qun. It is said that they are exchanging views on organizing a puppet "central government" and dividing the various puppet regimes in the north and south. The important issue is based on what Wen Zongyao and Chen Qun discussed when they crossed to Japan in mid-April. The Japanese had long planned to organize a puppet "Federal Central Government" from the northern and southern puppet governments, initially planning to have Wu Peifu or Wang Jingwei as the puppet leader. However, those on the Japanese side who favored Wu believed that Wu was a famous Chinese military figure and not a member of the Kuomintang, which could win over most of the military and civilians. At the same time, Wang's proposal to restore the organization of the National Government and continue to use the party-state flag of the Kuomintang was deemed inappropriate. As for those on the Japanese side who favored Wang, they mistakenly believed that Wang was a high-ranking official in the National Government and the Kuomintang and had considerable appeal. However, they advised Wang to slightly modify the use of the party-state flag. Since the Japanese supporters of Wu and Wang did not hold the same views, they summoned Wen and Chen to Japan in April to discuss the matter. Wen often told the Japanese that, based on his personal relationship with Wu, he could persuade Wu to take the stage, so Wen could be Wu's representative. Chen Qun was one of the people who facilitated the collusion between Wang and the Japanese. Before Wang arrived in Shanghai, Chen often conveyed the opinions of both Wang and the Japanese, so the Japanese implicitly recognized Chen as Wang's representative. After Wen and Chen returned to Nanjing in late April, Wang immediately arrived in Shanghai. Wang, Wen, Chen, and others repeatedly exchanged views, and Wang and Wen all hoped for the early establishment of a puppet "Federal Central Government." However, Wang believed that he still needed to personally contact the Japanese government, so he decided to cross to Japan in the coming days. Those accompanying him are Chen Bijun, Chen Chunpu, Gao Zongwu, and Japanese nationals such as Harada. The previous report that Wang returned to Shanghai from Japan on the 2nd of this month was inaccurate.</p>
<p>Future Puppet Government</p>
<p>The Japanese and Wang are eager to establish a puppet "central government" as soon as possible. It is said that the planned date of establishment is September 1st. It is rumored that the puppet "central government" will have Wu as the puppet president and Wang as the puppet premier. The administrative and legislative branches will be abolished. Liang Hongzhi may be the puppet speaker of the parliament. Wen Zongyao, Chen Jintao, Chen Qun, and others will serve as ministers of foreign affairs, finance, and internal affairs. The Japanese have significant intentions for organizing the puppet "central government." One is to use it as an organization to negotiate "peace" with the Japanese, so that Wang and others can sign treasonous treaties with the Japanese. Another is that the Japanese will use Wang and others to realize their conspiracy to control China with Chinese, dominating China's sovereignty and making China a vassal of Japan. Wang will cross to Japan in the coming days to discuss the steps to establish the puppet "central government." At the same time, there will be the recommendation of Zhu Ding, Matsui Haruo, and Hu Shouchang (Hu Jusheng), the chairman and vice-chairmen of the so-called "East Asia Anti-Communist League," to preside over the so-called peace talks to appease the Japanese dream of peace.</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Shot Down in Zhenhai; Pilot Falls to Ground and Dies; Japanese Fleet Press Department Communiqué Admits It; Japanese Aircraft and Warships Bomb and Drop Bombs Again on the 8th</h3>
<p>The Zhenhai Fortress of Ningbo was bombed by five Japanese aircraft at 1:00 PM on the 7th. The garrison forces returned fire and shot down one Japanese aircraft, which crashed into the sea outside Zhenhai. This news was first reported by a Da Guang News Agency reporter. Yesterday, the Japanese Fleet Press Department issued a communiqué admitting that one Japanese aircraft was shot down in Zhenhai.</p>
<p>According to the Communiqué:</p>
<p>"On the afternoon of the 7th, a detached unit of the Naval Air Force attacked Zhenhai. One of our raiding units, braving enemy artillery fire, bravely scouted the vicinity of the port's fort and penetrated, completing its heroic sacrifice." It is reported that one Japanese pilot failed to escape by parachute when the aircraft crashed.</p>
<p>Fell to Ground and Died</p>
<p>The garrison forces, fearing that there might still be pilots who had fallen to the ground and escaped, are now searching. At 5:00 PM on the same day, two Japanese warships shelled the fortress and stopped in the evening. At 6:00 AM on the 8th,</p>
<p>One Japanese Warship</p>
<p>Opened fire on the entrance to Zhenhai again with six shots. The garrison forces ignored it. At 7:00 AM, two Japanese aircraft re-entered the airspace over Zhenhai and dropped</p>
<p>Nine Bombs</p>
<p>At the foot of Zhaobao Mountain before escaping. Damage was minimal. In the afternoon, it was reported that no bombs were dropped, and shipping between Shanghai and Ningbo was unimpeded. The De Ping轮 set sail for Ningbo at 4:30 AM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Prosperous Cargo Transportation at Haiphong; Jardine Matheson Sends Gonghe Ship to Haiphong as a Lighter; Freight Rates Increase by Nearly 50%</h3>
<p>Since the fall of Guangzhou, Haiphong in French Indochina has become the main hub connecting the interior. Cargo transportation has suddenly become prosperous. However, besides the customs warehouses, there are no godowns prepared by merchants. Due to the lack of road vehicles, goods cannot be transported out in time, causing congestion in the warehouses. The customs has restricted the import of goods, so in the</p>
<p>Past Six Months</p>
<p>Both merchants and shipping companies have faced difficulties. Although the Taikoo and Jardine Matheson companies have sent the Yangtze River ships Wuchang and Pinghe to be stationed in Haiphong as lighters for storing goods, the ships are small and there are too many goods, which is of no help. It is reported that the customs in Haiphong has built additional warehouses, and the major work has been completed. Transportation companies have registered with the customs in advance to store goods transported on behalf of customers. The Hongyun Shipping Bureau, Weitai Bank, and various customs brokers in this city have</p>
<p>Registered Customs Warehouses</p>
<p>Jardine Matheson has recently sent the river ship Gonghe to Haiphong to be stationed there with Pinghe as a lighter. The ship left the port the day before yesterday (8th) morning and sailed directly to Haiphong via Hong Kong. A lot of goods were transported, over a thousand tons, mostly cotton yarn and piece goods. Freight rates have also increased repeatedly. Starting the day before yesterday (3rd), they increased by another 50%. However, merchants do not mind the high freight rates and only want to transport their goods as quickly as possible.</p>
<h3>Japanese Special Service Department Hired Detective Wang Ying Arrested and Executed</h3>
<p>Wang Ying, a secret agent of the Japanese Army Special Service Department, was in his thirties and from Pudong. He used to be a coppersmith. After the National Army moved west, he joined the Japanese Army Special Service Department as an agent, specializing in spying on the whereabouts of Chinese guerrillas. Many Chinese guerrilla soldiers were killed because of his betrayal. From last month until now, he has colluded with the Japanese army and navy to identify guerrilla members and captains in various docks and towns in southern Pudong, and he has threatened and oppressed the villagers. The Headquarters of the Loyal and Righteous National Salvation Army learned of this, and Chief of Staff Ji Tianchou designed a plan and personally kidnapped him from Shanghai to the headquarters. Commander He Xingjian and Commander Fan Gencai, Li Qimeng, and others decided to execute him by shooting. He was paraded for a week before being taken to the execution ground. The surrounding people were very happy.</p>

<h3>Husband Committed a Crime; Wife Quietly Left; Sues Husband for Abandonment and Requests Divorce; Husband Asks for Cohabitation; Two Cases Consolidated for Trial</h3>
<p>Lu Wenruo from Hangzhou, 25 years old, lives at 410 Maitheson Road. His father, Lu Kuangjiu, used to practice law and owned property in Zhabei, but he has passed away. Lu Wenruo currently works in the hosiery department of the Sincere Company. His sister, Lu Langru, used to be a typist in Yu Xiangqin's law firm and is now a scorekeeper in the Huierdeng Apple Games Department on Yuyuan Road. On May 22, 1933, Lu Wenruo married Huang Xiuzhen (29 years old, currently residing at No. 1 Lianyi Lane, Avenue Joffre), daughter of Huang Ruiling, manager of the Kaiyuan Coal Mine, through a matchmaker.</p>
<p>Has Three Children</p>
<p>The eldest son, Yunfang, is now seven years old. The second son, Yunxin, is five years old. The youngest daughter, Jingyan, is only two years old. After the marriage, Lu got into trouble with the law due to bad friends and was imprisoned for over two years. After being released from prison, the couple reconciled and lived together. Recently, conflicts have frequently occurred between the couple, and their relationship has become irreconcilable. Huang Xiuzhen also left with her children recently and reported to the police that Lu Wenruo had abandoned her. She also filed a lawsuit against Lu in the Special District Court</p>
<p>For Divorce</p>
<p>Her reason is that Lu had been sentenced to imprisonment, was subjected to intolerable abuse, and published advertisements in the newspaper, causing serious insults to the plaintiff. According to Article 1052 of the Civil Code and the Supreme Court's precedents No. 530, 977, and 2533 of 1933, all meet the conditions for divorce. Therefore, she requests a judgment granting the divorce and reserves the right to claim damages. Lu Wenruo also hired Chen Maoxuan as his lawyer to sue Huang Xiuzhen</p>
<p>For Cohabitation</p>
<p>And return of children. His reason is that married couples have an obligation to cohabitate. Lu Wenruo published a notice in the newspaper after his wife left, hoping she would realize her mistake. However, Huang falsely reported abandonment to the police and took away two sons and one daughter to threaten him. Therefore, he had no choice but to file this case. The two cases were separately summoned by Judge Gui Yu and Judge Peng Shi. Judge Gui first opened the court to hear Huang Xiuzhen's divorce case against Lu Wenruo. Judge Gui advised Huang</p>
<p>To Consider the Three Children</p>
<p>Not to insist on her own opinions and to seek a proper solution. If she cannot tolerate the family, the mother-in-law, and sisters-in-law, then consider living separately to avoid destroying eight years of marriage in an instant. She should find a way to restore the relationship and make the family as complete as before. He announced that the case would be postponed and advised both parties to try to reconcile outside the court. Then, Judge Peng heard Lu Wenruo's suit against Huang Xiuzhen for cohabitation and</p>
<p>Return of Children</p>
<p>First, the court asked both parties about the family situation and environment. Since Huang had filed for divorce in the same court, this case was part of the same incident and needed to be tried together. Therefore, he also announced that the case would be adjourned for a hearing after a summons.</p>
<h3>Subletter Makes Things Difficult for Tenant; Resists Arrest by Punching; Fined Forty Yuan</h3>
<p>Lin Qun, a woman living at 55 Shantou Road, rented the side room downstairs to Jian Jian A-liu to open a brothel. Soon, A-liu subleased the house to Yijun Brothel. However, A-liu owed 87 yuan in rent and left without paying, causing the sublessor Lin Qun to repeatedly make things difficult for Yijun (Li surname). Lin Qun's younger cousin, Que Wenlong, was young and energetic and helped his cousin cause trouble. In addition to privately removing eight bottles of beer and ten bottles of soda from Yijun's room and cutting the telephone line, he forcibly removed Yijun's furniture on the 30th of last month. Li Yijun immediately reported to the Laoza Police Station, which sent Chinese Detective Zhou Wenqing No. 106 and Western Detective Turner to investigate. Seeing Que Wenlong still in Yijun's room, they questioned him. However, Que not only did not answer but dared to resist arrest and punched Detective Zhou in the face. Western Detective Turner stepped forward to stop him and was also punched. As a result, Que was taken to the police station. Because the detective's injuries were not serious, he was not detained and was ordered to leave. He requested a warrant from the First Special District Court and summoned Que to the Fourth Criminal Court yesterday morning. The police lawyer Qian Xunjiu stated the circumstances and prosecuted according to the law. The Chinese and Western detectives also testified about the situation of being beaten. When questioned, the defendant confessed and did not admit to resisting arrest. Judge Meng sentenced Que Wenlong to a fine of 40 yuan for injuring someone's body in court.</p>
<h3>Three Robbers' Crimes Investigated; Sentencing Scheduled</h3>
<p>Tang Jian, the detective chief, and Wang Jinsheng, the detective of the Jing'an Temple Police Station, previously arrested robbers Liu A-san, Bian Yushan (aka Bian Er-tuzi), and Hu Mingyou (aka Lao Han) on Yichang Road and Xiaoshadu Road, and sent them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. While the case was postponed, the detectives in charge of the case found that Liu and Bian had, on February 26th of this year, at 7:00 PM, held weapons and gathered a gang to rob Wang Hengsheng's family at 1210 Yong'an Lane, Robison Road, of 160 yuan. On February 28th, at 4:00 AM, they went to Wang Hengsheng's house again and kidnapped the accountant Ji Hongchun, sending a letter demanding a ransom. On March 10th, at 7:15 PM, they robbed Gao Huixian, a Chinese detective at the Gordon Road Police Station, 115 Changping Road, of 170 yuan. On the night of March 22nd, at 9:00 PM, they robbed Fu Tingxiang's family at 2714 Robison Road of 60 yuan. Hu Mingyou also helped transport weapons. Yesterday morning, Judge Chuan Lin was elevated to the Second Criminal Court to jointly hear the case and ordered it to be postponed for review.</p>
<h3>Fire in Western Shanghai; Careless Cooking Causes Disaster</h3>
<p>At about 10:50 AM yesterday morning, a small fire broke out due to careless cooking by a worker in a certain construction site of Yanjiazhai, Madaiqiao, Jessfield Road, Western Shanghai. The fire brigade rushed to the rescue, but the fire was so intense that it took more than two hours to extinguish it. As a result, the construction site and the two neighboring dyeing factories and cloth factories, as well as a primary school, were completely burned down, causing huge losses. Because the fire was so fierce, the Far East gambling den at the intersection of Jessfield Road was very close to the fire scene, causing general panic among the gamblers.</p>
<h3>Wang Dongshan and Others Sell Drugs; Sentenced to Twelve Years Each</h3>
<p>Wang Dongshan, Song Yongjia, Wang Youde, and Ji Yaosan from Pudong set up a place at 54 Rue du Chasseur to provide people with heroin and morphine injections.

After questioning, Judge Chuan sentenced Wang Dongshan, Song Yongjia, and Wang Youde to twelve years of imprisonment each for using drugs. Ji Yaosan was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment for helping to sell drugs. The drugs were confiscated, and 85 yuan in cash was deposited in the treasury to be dealt with after investigation.</p>

<p>The Xiehe Yongji Sailing Ship, No. 8 Bao'an Lane, Xinqiao Street, French Concession, sent two luggers, Yongyu and Yongning, on the 19th of last month, intending to sail to Xiangshan to load firewood and charcoal. Unexpectedly, they were robbed by pirates in the waters of Yushan. Afterwards, they received a letter demanding a ransom of 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Three Women Commit Suicide</h3>
<p>Tao Li, a young woman of 19, living at 239 Mackenzie Road, had a dispute with her family at about 2:00 AM yesterday morning. Afterwards, she was depressed and committed suicide by swallowing all of her raw opium. She was taken to Guangren Hospital for treatment. Lu Yang, a 36-year-old woman from Yancheng, living at No. 6 Xiexing Lane, Avenue Abert, swallowed opium and committed suicide at dawn yesterday morning due to family financial difficulties. She was taken to Shilong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Huang Chen, a young woman of 20, renting a room at 459 Route de Ghisi, French Concession, swallowed sleeping pills for some reason at about 7:20 PM last night and attempted suicide. She was taken to the Red Cross Hospital on Route Haig for treatment.</p>
<h3>Ragged Man Hangs Himself</h3>
<p>At about 9:15 PM last night, a man in his forties, dressed in rags, used a belt to hang himself on a dead tree behind the Bank of Communications on Hankou Road. Patrolman No. 2280 from the Central Police Station noticed it and immediately rescued him, calling an ambulance to take him to Renji Hospital. The treatment was ineffective, and he died shortly after.</p>
<h3>Trademark Lawsuit of Coca-Cola Company Judged</h3>
<p>The American Coca-Cola Company sued the Yili Soda Factory, established by the Shanghai Huizhong Bank, for using the English trademark Eddie-Kola and the Chinese trademark 爱的可乐, believing that it infringed on the rights of its English trademark Coca-Cola and Chinese trademark 可口可乐. They hired attorneys Allman, Davis, and Kirk Paul to represent them. Attorney Davis filed a lawsuit with the United States Court for China on behalf of the plaintiff. The defendant hired attorney Fan Kelin to respond. The case has now been concluded, and the United States Court for China ruled in favor of the plaintiff, recognizing that the Eddie-Kola (爱的可乐) trademark of Yili Soda Factory is easily confused with the Coca-Cola (可口可乐) trademark of the plaintiff. Therefore, the defendant is prohibited from using it again and is ordered to bear the litigation costs.</p>
<h3>Statistics on the Number of Refugees</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Public Works Department, there are currently 38 refugee shelters inspected by the department, housing a total of 40,901 refugees.</p>
<h3>Relocation of the Hongkou Epidemic Hospital</h3>
<p>The Hongkou Epidemic Hospital has been located at the intersection of Yucai Road and Linping Road for over ten years, opening every summer. Since the outbreak of the war, the original location has been inaccessible, causing it to be suspended. Last year, it was planned to be relocated, but it was stopped due to the lack of suitable housing. It is reported that it has recently obtained the support of the Shanghai Charity Organization Joint Relief Association, which agreed to transfer the land of Mu Xu at the intersection of Xingjiapo Road and Miaozhou Road, allocated by the Shanghai Municipal Council, to the hospital for the construction of temporary hospital buildings. The interior can accommodate 120 beds. Zhu Xiaofang and Lin Chunshan are still in charge of medical affairs.

<h3>Woman Adulteress; Hangs Herself Out of Shame After Returning; Abandons Husband and Children to Elopes with Lover; Commits Suicide After Being Found by Family</h3>
<p>Wang Wu, a young woman of 25 from Yancheng, Jiangbei, was married to Wang Jiawang from the same hometown. They already had one child each, a daughter who is six years old and a son who is just four years old. She lived with her in-laws in the Xinglong Teahouse at 453 Xinglong Street, Dapuqiao, French Concession. Her husband worked as an old driver in a foreign vegetable shop. However, Wang was restless and had an affair with Wu Bulou from the same hometown. The affair was passionate, and on December 21st of last year, she abandoned her husband and children and secretly escaped, hiding with her lover in Wuxi. Her father-in-law, Wang Yuanqing, and her father found out the whereabouts and went to Wuxi together to find her. She returned to Shanghai on the 6th of this month and was briefly rebuked, hoping that she would change her ways and raise her children. In order to prevent neighbors from laughing at her, she was ordered to live in the No. 417 Lane, non-numbered bungalow, on Huanlong Road, at the home of her husband's maternal uncle, Gao Jinshan. Unexpectedly, Wang was unhappy after returning to Shanghai and had the thought of ending her life. At 3:00 PM on the 8th, she hanged herself in the loft of Gao Jinshan's house. When she was discovered and rescued, she had already stopped breathing. She was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment but was ineffective and died that night. The hospital reported it to the French police station, which sent detectives to investigate. Her body was taken to the mortuary. Yesterday, the case was reported to Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, who arrived at the mortuary to examine the body. Wang Yuanqing, her father-in-law, signed a certificate to claim the body for burial.</p>

<h3>Husband Abandons Wife and Children: Injury Part of the Case Concluded and Awaiting Judgment; Abandonment Part Scheduled for Further Review</h3>
<p>Xu Jinchang, from Wuxi, is 38 years old and works at the Chinese Merchants Cloth Exchange, earning an annual income of over 4,000 yuan. He has been living with Wang Linxian (32 years old this year) for over ten years and has four children. They currently reside at 12 Liyuan Lane, Route Conty, in the French Concession. Their relationship was initially strong, but has gradually cooled in recent years. On the 8th day of this year, the couple argued over</p>
<p>a trivial matter,</p>
<p>resulting in Wang Linxian being beaten and injured by Xu. She immediately appointed lawyer Yu Xiufang to represent her, and filed a petition with the Procuratorate of the Second Special District Court requesting a medical examination. She also filed a petition with the Criminal Division of the same court, accusing Xu Jinchang of assault. After the court received the petitions, it opened a hearing and summoned the defendant, who avoided appearing in court on the grounds that he was going to Wuxi. The court then issued an arrest warrant and brought him into custody. From then on, Xu</p>
<p>practiced abandonment</p>
<p>of Wang Linxian and their children, disregarding their livelihood. Later, Wang Linxian encountered Xu in the International Settlement, turned him over to the police, and requested the Second Special District Court to send police officers to bring Xu to court. He was ordered to be released on bail pending trial. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Liquan opened a continued hearing. The plaintiff, Wang Linxian, accompanied by her lawyer, appeared in court and stated, "On the 8th day of the month, I asked the defendant for daily living expenses, but not only did he refuse, but he also committed violence and</p>
<p>injured me."</p>
<p>The defendant testified that "On the 8th day of the month, the plaintiff was wearing red nail polish and wanted to go out. I criticized her for being extravagant, as we are not a wealthy family, and she should not dress like that. She did not listen, so I scolded her. She refused to obey, so I slapped her cheek once." After reviewing the testimonies, the court found the facts of the case to be clear and ordered the closing of arguments, announcing that the judgment would be delivered on the 13th, and then adjourned. Because Xu</p>
<p>abandoned his children</p>
<p>and disregarded their needs, Wang Linxian, in her capacity as legal guardian, filed a complaint with the French police. Because the police had not been able to locate Xu, they were waiting outside the court yesterday when they learned that Xu was attending the court hearing. They immediately dispatched plainclothes detectives to arrest Xu as he left the court and took him to the police station to await further investigation.</p>
<h3>Market News</h3>
<p>Fadal Trucks Arriving in Shanghai Soon The Zhengyi Automobile Company at 177 Rue Courbet, originally a large-scale automobile repair shop, has reportedly begun to manage Fadal trucks, Firestone tires, and Red Brand batteries since last month.

<p>Marty's New Showroom Pre-Announcement The American Marty Motor Company, in addition to its showroom at 10 Avenue Edward VII, also has two other locations on Route Ghisi and Avenue Haig: one for the repair department and one for the body assembly station. Due to the expansion of business, the above three locations are no longer sufficient. Recently, the company invested 100,000 yuan to purchase the former Hacking Company's showroom and repair department at 640 Avenue Foch, which occupies an area of more than three mu. According to Mr. Marty, the general manager of the company, the new showroom will be used exclusively to display Packard and Vauxhall automobiles. The new repair department is currently sending people directly to foreign countries to order the latest repair machinery in the hope of becoming the newest automobile repair shop in Shanghai. As for Chrysler and Dodge automobiles, they are still displayed in the showroom on Avenue Edward VII. The repair department on Route Ghisi remains as it is. However, the procurement of new repair machinery and the decoration of the showroom will take a considerable amount of time, so it will not be completed until early September at the earliest. It is expected that the opening of the new showroom and repair department will make a significant contribution to the automotive industry at that time.</p>

<h3>Letters to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing on behalf of Mr. Feng Shirong, who claims that he read a news item in the Shen Bao on the 8th of this month entitled "Feng Baorong Forges Will and Seizes Niece-in-Law's Huge Property." The contents of the news item do not correspond to the facts. My client acted in accordance with the will of Ms. Feng Jin and a unanimous resolution of her relatives' meeting to designate Feng Gengsheng and Feng Gengfa, the adopted grandsons of Ms. Feng Jin, to be the custodians of her estate. However, Ms. Feng Wang has long severed relations with Ms. Feng Jin and has now come forward in her capacity as legal guardian to claim guardianship rights. After repeated investigations by the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court, the case was about to be concluded when the witness Feng Guifen suddenly claimed that her previous testimony was false. The Civil Division transferred the case to the Procuratorate for investigation and summoned my client and his son Shanliang to court for questioning on the 7th of this month. Feng Guifen did not appear in court at the time and sent a letter to my client stating that her confession was induced by the other party's enticement and coercion and that she felt uneasy in her conscience. The letter was presented to the court for review. At the same time, Shanliang testified that Feng Guifen had asked him to write a note for her to keep as a memorandum, but it was not his intention, and that everything written on the note was true and there was no fabrication. The report published by your newspaper concerning my client and others is inaccurate and affects my client's reputation. Please correct it in your newspaper. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Chen Tingrui, June 9th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing on behalf of my clients, Li Yansun, Li Yongsun, Li Runshan, and Li Jimin, who claim that they read a news item in the Shen Bao on the 7th entitled "Wan Chen Sauce Garden Management" and "Shareholders Control, Shareholders Encroach" concerning their lawsuit against Zhang Qiuhua and others for encroaching on profits. The details of the article regarding my clients' allegations of encroachment by Zhang Qiuhua and others on the benefits are not fully in accordance with the facts. Li Runshan is the manager of this garden, while Zhang Qiuhua is only the director of the Min Ti Ni Yin Road branch garden, and is not the manager of this garden. We are afraid of misunderstandings from the outside world. In addition to publishing a statement in the newspaper, we will entrust another letter for correction. Accordingly, we urgently address to you, hoping that you will grant a correction. Yours sincerely, Lawyer Wu Huatai, June 9th.</p>
<p>To the Editor: In the case of abuse of a maid reported in your newspaper on June 8, there was a person named Wu Huikang who falsely claimed to live at No. 5, Lane 607, Beijing Road. This address is the exclusive residence of our distribution office and has not been sublet, nor is there such a person. We hereby write to you specially for correction. Please post it in the letters to the editor section to avoid misunderstanding and to correct the record. With respect, The Shen Bao, The Third One New Silk Factory Distribution Office, June 9th.</p>

<h3>Sino-Western Games: Today's Finals at the American School for Boys; Western YMCA Possesses Strong Strength and is Expected to Retain the Championship; Chinese Athletic Federation and Lido Will Contend with Meilin for Second Place</h3>
<p>The open track and field games organized by the Shanghai International Amateur Athletic Federation will continue at the American School for Boys on Route Petain today, starting at 2 PM. There are seven track events and four field events, all of which are finals. After last Saturday's competition, the Western YMCA leads the pack with 25 points, followed by Meilin with 18 points in second place, with the Chinese Athletic Federation, Lido, and the Russian Army closely behind. Considering the strength of each team, the Western YMCA is likely to retain the championship. If Meilin's Finke doesn't encounter any unexpected incidents, he will pose a threat to the Western YMCA. Our Chinese Athletic Federation and Lido have abundant talent and have hopes of competing for the runner-up position. In addition, the five teams of School Federation and the Russian Army are more remarkable; the others are average. After the competition, the awards ceremony will be hosted by President Bratt. Tickets are still sold for 60 cents and $1.10.</p>
<p>Today's Schedule</p>
<p>(1) 100-Yard Finals 2:00 PM</p>
<p>(2) Pole Vault 2:00 PM</p>
<p>(3) 440-Yard Finals 2:10 PM</p>

<p>(10) High Jump 3:20 PM</p>
<p>(11) 880-Yard Relay 4:20 PM</p>
<p>Finals Outlook</p>
<p>In the short distance, School Federation's F. Edwards is absent due to illness. His brother, C. Edwards, will compete with Western YMCA's Fonseca, Lido's Chen Yongfu, Liu Yongsen, and Peide's Kurzmann. In the middle distance, Meilin's Finke hopes to sweep the top spots in both the 440-yard and 880-yard events. In the two-mile event, Lido's Wang Zhenglin is alone at the top, but Chinese Athletic Federation's Liu Guangfa, Meilin's Finke, Peide's Pike, and two French Army athletes' strength should not be underestimated. In the high hurdles, Chinese Athletic Federation's Li Zhenzhong should have no problem securing first place, as his strong opponent, Que Bo, has left. In the high jump, Chinese Athletic Federation's Wu Bixian and Lido's Xu Wenkui have a good chance. In the triple jump, Chinese Athletic Federation's Zhang Jiakui and Western YMCA's Fonseca have the highest hopes. The defending champions in the discus and pole vault, Meilin's Koffman and Russian Army's Abramov, are both still participating, making it difficult for the Chinese athletes to compete. In the 880-yard relay, the School Federation has a strong momentum, and the Western YMCA will be at a disadvantage.</p>

<h3>Overview of Vocational Education in China: Actively Training Vocational Education Teachers and Conducting Exhibitions for Mutual Learning</h3>
<p>Teacher Qualification Review</p>
<p>Since the promulgation of the "Standards for the Establishment and Financial Allocation of Secondary Schools," the abnormal development of secondary education in various regions has gradually been corrected. Vocational schools have been increasing in number, creating an urgent need for excellent vocational teachers. In October 1933, the Ministry of Education promulgated the "Outline of Measures for the Registration, Qualification Assessment, and Training of Vocational Subject Teachers in Vocational Schools in Provinces and Cities." The registration method is divided into two types: first, those who have graduated from Class A industrial schools or agricultural, industrial, or commercial departments of senior high schools, or who have at least two years of experience, or who are mid-level technicians in the vocational industry and have continued to work for more than four years, may request registration to serve as vocational subject teachers in junior vocational schools and vocational supplementary schools; second, those who have graduated from domestic or foreign colleges or above and have at least two years of vocational experience, or who are senior technicians in the vocational industry and have continued to work for more than four years, may request registration to serve as vocational subject teachers in senior vocational schools. If provinces and cities lack the aforementioned registered teachers, but there are skilled craftsmen who are willing to serve as vocational technology subject teachers in senior or junior vocational schools, their technical types and levels should be assessed separately. If provinces and cities lack the aforementioned personnel, they should entrust colleges or above with achievements to train them separately. The training methods are as follows: senior vocational school teachers should recruit graduates from senior high schools with equivalent qualifications and provide them with three to four years of training, or recruit graduates from senior vocational schools with equivalent qualifications and provide them with three years of training for continued research in their original disciplines; junior vocational school teachers should recruit graduates from junior high schools with equivalent qualifications and provide them with three years of training, or recruit graduates from junior vocational schools with equivalent qualifications and provide them with one to two years of training for continued research in their original disciplines. The subjects to be trained have also been stipulated separately.</p>
<p>In 1937, the "Measures for the Registration of Technical Personnel in Provinces and Cities" were formulated and promulgated for implementation.</p>
<p>In the summers of 1936, 1937, and 1938, the Ministry of Education held training sessions for agricultural and industrial vocational schools and junior high school labor teachers. The agricultural training sessions were organized by the Ministry of Education in conjunction with Central University and Jinling University and the Central Agricultural Experiment Institute. The industrial training sessions were ordered by the Ministry of Education to be organized by the Shanghai Lester Technical College and Tongji University. These sessions will continue to be held in the future to provide further training for vocational teachers and labor teachers in various subjects.</p>
<h3>Jiang Jixin, Member of the Textbook Review Committee, Discusses the Shortcomings of Secondary School History Textbooks: Common Shortcomings in the Areas of Ethnicity and Culture</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) Jiang Jixin, a member of the Secondary School Textbook Editing and Textbook Review Committee of the Ministry of Education, recently reviewed the secondary school history textbooks published by major bookstores and extracted many of their shortcomings. The main points are summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Detailed Review of Five Types; Brief Review of Four Types</p>
<p>The secondary school history textbooks reviewed this time include Lu Simian's "High School History of China" (Commercial Press), Jie Xinren's "Junior High School History of Foreign Countries" (World), Chen Zuyuan's "Junior High School History of Foreign Countries" (Zhengzhong), Yu Xun's "High School History of China" (World), and Li Jigu's "Junior High School History of Foreign Countries" (World), etc. Jin Zhaozhi's "High School History of China" (Chung Hwa Book Company), Geng Danru and Wang Zongwu's co-edited "High School History of Foreign Countries" (Zhengzhong), He Bingsong's "High School History of Foreign Countries" (Commercial Press), and Li Qingsong and Jiang Gongsheng's co-edited "Junior High School History of China" (Datong) were also briefly reviewed. In general, high school history textbooks are slightly better than junior high school textbooks. As for the shortcomings found in the books, there are several points as follows:</p>
<p>Origin of the Nation; Erroneous Theories Not Eliminated</p>
<p>Regarding the origin of the Chinese nation, most history textbooks rely on already discovered underground materials to strongly argue that the Chinese nation has lived in this magnificent land of China since ancient times and did not migrate from elsewhere. They clearly recognize the erroneous theories such as the "Eastern Theory" or "Western Theory" that were first advocated by foreigners. This is a major progress in history textbooks in recent years. However, there are still history textbooks that remain vague about the origin of the Chinese nation, saying either "opinions vary" or "there is no consensus, so doubts remain" (Lu Simian and Yu Xun both do this), or openly advocate the "Western Theory" (Zhao Xinren's "Junior High School History of Foreign Countries," Volume 1, page 67, has this argument). This type of statement not only prevents Chinese people from understanding the source of their ancestors but also indirectly shakes the determination of the people to "defend the territory and love the motherland." This is one of the first shortcomings I felt when reading secondary school history textbooks.</p>
<p>National Boundaries; Too Strictly Divided</p>
<p>Furthermore, many editors of history textbooks still cannot escape the narrow old concepts, dividing the boundaries of the various ethnic groups too strictly, and obviously not proactively following the trajectory of the Chinese nation's evolution, which is contrary to the aims of the Three People's Principles' nationalism. For example, the historical facts of the mixing or assimilation of various ethnic groups in terms of language, bloodlines, clothing, and living habits are good materials for promoting the unity and integration of various ethnic groups, and should be fully developed to make the people understand that the mutual integration of the various ethnic groups has not been a matter of one day or one night. However, in some textbooks, the adoption of Hu clothing and Hu language by the Han people, or the adoption of Han surnames and customs by the Hu people, are often criticized. Regarding this point, Lu Simian's "High School History of China" is the most serious. In Lu's book, he often uses terms such as "foreigners" and "ethnic minorities" to refer to the various ethnic groups in the borderlands, in contrast to "China," deliberately strictly dividing the boundaries of the various domestic ethnic groups, almost denying that the ethnic minorities in the borderlands are Chinese. In addition, in some textbooks, the word "Chinese" is often replaced by the words "Han people" or "Han ethnicity" where it should be used, which is completely like the writing style of foreigners. Especially the words "Han ethnicity" are clearly one of the strange terms deliberately used by the Japanese to "divide the Chinese," but some textbooks blindly adopt it, which is puzzling.</p>
<p>Ancient Culture; Description Brief</p>
<p>In the History of China, the description of "ancient culture" is extremely important, because promoting the achievements of our ancestors in culture can enhance the national consciousness of the present people and stimulate the patriotic spirit of the present people. Therefore, some countries that have only recently evolved and have no ancient culture to speak of do not hesitate to fabricate history and falsely claim that their ancestors had achievements in culture in order to inspire their people. However, the several high school history textbooks I have seen have extremely brief and unsystematic descriptions of our country's ancient culture. They often fail to mention the inventions and creations in areas such as calendars, music, medicine, etc., and "the fact that the philosophical thoughts of the various schools of thought in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods are described in great detail, while the development of crafts and medicine at that time is not mentioned at all" is a common problem in all the books.</p>
<p>External Influence; Even Less Emphasized</p>
<p>Secondly, the status of Chinese culture in the world and its influence on other countries should be clearly stated in both Chinese and foreign history textbooks to prove that our country's culture has unparalleled value, which is beyond the reach of some self-proclaimed first-class powers. For example, the institutions, languages, writing, academic, skills, surnames, clothing, and living habits of Japan and other ethnic groups in East Asia are mostly imitations of our country, but in all history textbooks, the description of the influence of our culture on foreign countries only briefly mentions the westward transmission of the three major inventions (five major inventions) and the fact that the Uighurs came to China to study during the Sui and Tang dynasties. As for the status of our academic thought in the historical evolution of other countries and how much Japan's Meiji Restoration benefited from our country, they are not mentioned at all. Needless to say, everything else is not in the minds of those textbook editors.</p>
<h3>Concerned About Schools: The Problem of Student Congestion; More Than a Dozen Schools Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>Since the retreat of the National Army from the Shanghai Concession area, the situation has remained relatively safe. As a result, many people from the war zones in the interior have fled to Shanghai, and a considerable number of them are students from elementary, middle, and high schools. Due to the increase in students, the number of newly established schools at all levels has increased like mushrooms after rain, but because of expensive rents, the school buildings are mostly narrow, so they have all exceeded their original quotas, resulting in an intractable problem of congestion. The Shanghai Municipal Council's Education Department, concerned about the congestion of students in its affiliated schools, which hinders both academics and hygiene, has sent letters to the schools instructing them to find spacious school buildings to relocate and start classes as soon as possible if their school buildings are insufficient. According to inquiries from the Education Department, only a dozen schools have found spacious houses to relocate to date, while more than a dozen schools have found the problem of congestion difficult to resolve due to the difficulty of finding empty houses. However, the Education Department is still urging them to comply quickly to emphasize academics, they say.</p>
<h3>School News</h3>
<p>Shanghai University Summer School: Shanghai University has long had the establishment of a summer school, with detailed planning and outstanding achievements. This summer school is ready, and the courses offered are all in line with practical needs. Class time is from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM every day, and registration and payment are scheduled for July 4.</p>
<p>Qingxin Middle School: Qingxin Middle School in Nanmen was founded by the American Presbyterian Church and has a history of 79 years, making it the earliest school established in Shanghai. Since the outbreak of the war, it has resumed classes in the Huizhong school building. It runs the school with a practical teaching and strict management spirit. As the contract with Huizhong is about to expire and there are various inconveniences, and in order to expand the enrollment for the next semester, it has rented the entire second floor of the Shanghai Women's Bank on Nanjing Road, east of Shilu, as a temporary school building. It will start working there on July 3. It is also heard that the school has decided to hold a summer remedial school to meet the needs of students. All chapters and rules will be sent upon request.</p>
<p>Jiangdong Middle School: Private Jiangdong Middle School, 209 Shandong Road, has established a branch school at 966 Avenue Edward VII this semester.

<h3>Shanghai to Singapore</h3>
<p>— Source</p>
<p>Singapore is located on a small island at the southern tip of the British Malayan Peninsula, connected to the mainland by a causeway. Due to its strategic position on the Europe-Asia sea route and the active management by the British, it has become an important commercial center, with prosperous trade, surpassing other places in Southeast Asia. Tin is the main export, followed by rice, rubber, spices, etc. The total population of the city is over 500,000, of which Chinese account for 70-80%. In recent years, the number of Chinese going to the city for trade has been increasing. However, for those who are going there for the first time, they may not be very clear about all the travel matters. Therefore, a brief introduction is given on the procedures to be completed before departure, the liners sailing between Shanghai and Singapore, and the prices of each class, for the reference and selection of those who are going there for the first time.</p>
<p>Applying for a Passport Before departure, you must first apply for a passport to go abroad. The procedure is to fill out an application form (the guarantor section of the application form must be stamped by the shop and its manager.) and prepare five 3-inch photos and apply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The passport fee is twelve yuan. You can also entrust the China Travel Service to handle it, but it will take three weeks.</p>
<p>British Consulate Signature After obtaining the passport, go to the British Consulate to fill out two application forms and submit the supporting documents sent from the destination. Then the consulate will send the application form to the local government for investigation. After the local government investigates, it will report the facts to the local consulate. If it is considered qualified, the passport will be issued. The signature fee is ten shillings and six pence in British gold.</p>
<p>Doctor's Certificate Before purchasing a ticket, you must go to the doctor for smallpox vaccination and inoculation, and obtain a certificate from the doctor. Otherwise, the shipping company will not allow you to purchase a ticket and board the ship. (If you are traveling in the third or fourth class, the doctor's certificate must be issued by the Public Works Bureau to be valid.)</p>
<p>After the passport signature and doctor's certificate are completed, you can choose to purchase a ticket. There are ships from Shanghai to Singapore from Italian Post, French Post, British, North German, Blue Funnel and other companies. The ships and ticket prices of each company are listed below:</p>
<p>(A) Italian Postal Ship Company has the "Conte Verde", "Conte Rosso", "Conte Biancamano", and "Victoria" ships. Ticket prices: First class British gold 20 pounds, second class 14 pounds, economy second class 10 pounds. The journey takes seven days.</p>
<p>(B) French Postal Ship Company has "Aramis", "Athos II", "Marshal Joffre", "President Doumer", "Chantraboon", "Chenla Bao", "Felix Roussel" and other ships. Ticket prices: First class British gold 20 pounds, second class 15 pounds, third class 9 pounds. The journey takes ten days.</p>
<p>(C) British Company has "Cathay", "Dundela", "Ranchi", "Rawalpindi", "Canton", "Kaffir", "Chitral", "Rajputana" and other ships. Ticket prices: First class British gold 20 pounds, second class 14 pounds (no third class).</p>
<p>(D) North German Company has "Scharnhorst", "Gneisenau", "Bochum" ships. Ticket prices are the same as the British company.</p>
<p>(E) Blue Funnel Company has "Hector", "Antenor", "Patroclus", "Sarpedon" ships. Ticket prices: First class British gold 18 pounds (no second or third class).</p>
<h3>National Railways Implement Fare Increase</h3>
<p>— Bao Cheng</p>
<p>Since the incident, although most of the national railways have been unable to continue operating due to environmental reasons, the transportation authorities have still tried their best to exert their functions and work hard on transportation. In addition to the original national railways that continue to operate within the possible scope, new routes have also been added to facilitate transportation. For example, the recently opened Hunan-Guangxi and Hunan-Guizhou railways were both opened after the war. According to reliable sources, the Ministry of Transportation has now stipulated that from May 11th of this year, the passenger fares of all national railways will be increased, and a three-month trial will be conducted, stipulating the following measures:</p>
<p>(1) All passenger tickets will be calculated at a 25% increase from this date.</p>
<p>(2) All calculated remainders will still be calculated according to the previous method of calculating as five cents if it is less than five cents, and as one dime if it is more than five cents but less than one dime.</p>
<p>(3) Parcel, sleeper tickets, platform tickets, and express train surcharges will be handled as before.</p>
<p>(4) When selling special express tickets, the express train ticket should be removed first, increased by 25%, and then the express train fee should be added separately.</p>
<p>(5) Children's tickets, group tickets, round-trip tickets, and military half-price tickets will all be discounted based on the increased ticket price.</p>
<p>(6) Supplementary penalty fares should also be penalized by half based on the increased ticket price.</p>
<p>(7) A stamp of "Increased price by 25% by order" should be affixed on the current passenger tickets. Before the Accounting Office of the Railway Bureau produces and issues this stamp, the above words can be noted in red ink.</p>
<p>According to the national railway passenger tickets, this decision to increase by as much as a quarter is undoubtedly too much. However, during this time of national crisis, it seems that the various sectors will not feel any dissatisfaction with such a small increase in expenses.</p>
<h3>Air Transport</h3>
<p>— Star</p>
<p>The Eurasian Aviation Company's southwest airlines, namely, Chongqing-Hong Kong, Chongqing-Yunnan River, and Rong-Yu (Chengdu-Chongqing) lines, had been suspended for a period of time due to the shortage of aircraft. Now they have gradually resumed, but with fewer flights.</p>
<p>The Chongqing-Hong Kong line's Yu-Gui (Chongqing-Guilin) section is scheduled to go south on Wednesdays and Fridays, and north on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The Gui-Hong (Guilin-Hong Kong) section is still scheduled as irregular night flights. Therefore, the company flies directly between Chongqing and Hong Kong more than three times a week, and the flight dates are still irregular. The Chongqing-Yunnan is south on Mondays and north on Fridays. The Dien-He (Yunnan-Hanoi, Vietnam) line is a round trip on Tuesdays and Saturdays. The Rong-Dien line is a round trip on Thursdays. As for the company's northwest lines, they are now in a completely suspended state. The ticket prices are still the same as before. There are no changes in the routes and ticket prices of China National Aviation Corporation.</p>
<h3>Entering Guangxi Itinerary</h3>
<p>— Que Chang</p>
<p>Before Guangzhou was abandoned, anyone going to Guangxi from Shanghai could first take a ship to Hong Kong, then take an electric boat from Hong Kong to Wuzhou; after arriving in Wuzhou, take a public bus via Guixian to Liuzhou, and then go to Guilin or other places from Liuzhou, which was very convenient. Such a journey only took four days (referring to starting from Hong Kong; the Shanghai-Hong Kong section depends on what ship you are taking.) and the travel expenses were only thirty or forty yuan. However, since Guangzhou was abandoned, this road is impassable, and it is more difficult to go to Guangxi again. There was a time when you could land in Guangzhou Bay and go to Guangxi, but since Hainan Island was occupied, this road has also been affected. However, our transportation authorities have not been affected by the war in their mission to develop southwest transportation. The war continues to evolve, and roads and other transportation are still progressing. Although the route is relatively longer, the time will inevitably increase, but in any case, we will not be hindered. Our shortcut to Guangxi is an example;</p>
<p>Under today's circumstances, if you want to go to Guangxi from Shanghai, the first step is always to go to French Haiphong. There are direct ships between Shanghai and Haiphong. Large cabins are divided into two types: 225 yuan and 215 yuan, second-class large cabins are 190 yuan, officer cabins are 90 yuan, room cabins are 66 yuan, and hanging berths are 44 yuan. (Although going directly to Haiphong is more economical than transferring through Hong Kong, it takes about ten days. If you don't want to delay too much, it is still better to transfer through Hong Kong.) Before going to Haiphong, you should first apply to the government for a transit passport through Vietnam. Each passport should pay a fee of 8 yuan in national currency, submit five recent photos, and find a suitable guarantor. China Travel Service can handle the application procedures, which takes four weeks. If you transfer through Hong Kong, you can apply to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Visa Office on the 5th floor of the Banque de l'Indochine in Hong Kong. You need to submit three 4.5-inch half-length photos, fill out two forms for visa matters, have them guaranteed by a solid store or manager in Hong Kong, and submit them to the office in person along with a passport fee of 2 yuan and a stamp tax of 4 yuan. Collect the receipt, and you can pick up the visa based on the receipt in four or five days. (To be continued in the next issue)</p>

<h3>After Continuous Fluctuations in Finance, Foreign Exchange Has Been Slightly Stabilized, Importers Plan to Apply for the Issuance of New Exchange Rates, Hong Kong Side Has Supply According to Current Exchange Rates, The Date of Determination Should Not Be Far Away</h3>
<p>The foreign exchange market yesterday, HSBC announced the listing, only the Dutch exchange rate returned to 125, the rest were the same as the third listing on the previous day. The dark market situation of British and American exchange rates has been slightly stabilized compared to before. Initially, due to the frequent settlement of foreign firms and the secret efforts of Chinese merchants, the potential became tight. Later, it was heard that HSBC Bank will maintain the listed price (British gold 6.5 shillings, American exchange rate 12.625 yuan). It was also rumored that various import firms felt that the sharp contraction of the dark market exchange rate had greatly affected their business prospects, so they gathered to discuss and seek remedial measures. It was also said that they decided to send a telegram to the Ministry of Finance requesting the issuance of a new exchange rate specifically for foreign firms, so that they would not be subjected to unexpected losses due to speculation and manipulation by certain parties and Chinese and Western merchants. This move may soon become a reality, because China seems to have no intention of clarifying the Shanghai black market exchange rate, but only to do the same as last year when it fell to about 8 shillings, and then take 8 shillings as the exchange rate. If so, the listed price of about 6.5 shillings may be the level of the new exchange rate in the future. However, this is not a thorough solution after all, how can it prevent the past abuses? This depends on how the Chinese authorities take measures. As a result, the general intention of foreign firms to buy in yesterday suddenly faded, and the market suddenly loosened due to the competition between Hong Kong telegrams and foreign firms to supply. Later, the market situation became tight again due to the repeated buying in by Western merchant Sassoon. As a result, the British exchange rate continued to tighten by 1875, and the American exchange rate also weakened by 375. The trading was flat throughout the day. As for the Hong Kong exchange rate, it could still be settled at 45 yuan.</p>
<p>Hong Kong telegrams were once thrown out</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London big bar was flat in the near and far term, the New York bank was fixed, the London raw gold was one shilling, the exchange rate of British against American was 7 cents small, against Shanghai it fell sharply by 1 shilling 4375, against France it did not change, American against British shrank by 1875, against Shanghai it fell sharply again by 1 yuan 40 cents, against France it fell by 0.0625, the central listing of each exchange rate was as before, the bank opened the spot selling price in the morning, the British exchange rate was 6.75 shillings and the American exchange rate was 13.125 yuan, compared with the previous closing, there was no glory. After opening, foreign firms and Chinese merchants competed to buy in, and the bank's intention to supply was not good, resulting in a tight situation. It is estimated that foreign firms settled the spot British gold for 6.625 shillings for entering the British Bank, and at the same time the American exchange rate also weakened to 12.875 yuan. When HSBC announced the listing at 9:30, only the Dutch exchange rate returned to 125, the rest remained at the original price and said that the bank's balance tax was announced, and there was no change, still levying 4.50%. At that time, it was suddenly heard that HSBC was willing to maintain the listed price, which caused a selling trend. As a result, Western merchant Sassoon, Chinese merchants and foreign firms competed to buy in. However, foreign firms suddenly had the intention to sell, and Hong Kong telegrams also came to supply, and the market situation suddenly rebounded and softened. It is estimated that Sassoon settled the spot British gold for 6.6875 shillings for entering Hong Kong telegrams, and Chinese merchants and foreign firms successively bought in the spot British gold of 6.6875 shillings from McCali and Anda. Soon foreign firms absorbed and purchased the spot American exchange rate of 13 yuan from a certain bank in Belgium. Near noon, foreign firms came to buy in again, and the potential became tight again. Extended to the afternoon closing, the bank's selling price of British gold tightened again to 6.625 shillings, and the American exchange rate also weakened to 12.875 yuan. Compared with the morning opening, the British exchange rate shrank by 125 and the American exchange rate weakened by 25. It is said that the Hong Kong exchange rate bank's intention to sell is still good, and the estimated selling price is 45 yuan.</p>
<p>Although Sassoon bought in, the impact was small</p>
<p>The afternoon trading was quite clear, and the market situation was still flat. First, Yooli absorbed and entered the same bank's July British gold for 6.5 shillings. Later, Western merchant Sassoon came to buy in again, and foreign firms also followed suit, but because Hong Kong telegrams also had a strong stomach to sell, it was not affected. It is estimated that Sassoon and foreign firms successively settled and entered the spot British gold of 6.625 shillings, and also the spot American exchange rate of 12.8125 and 875. After this, foreign firms still wanted to buy in, but Hong Kong telegrams had stopped throwing out, and foreign firms' intention to supply was weak, and the situation was slightly tight. The Hong Kong exchange rate, the foreign firms were quite willing to sell out at 45 yuan. Extended to the evening closing, the bank's spot selling price, the British exchange rate was 6.5625 shillings, and the American exchange rate was 12.75 yuan. Compared with the previous day's evening closing, the British exchange rate tightened by 1875 and the American exchange rate also weakened by 375. The British and American exchange rates have shrunk for three consecutive days, the British exchange rate has totaled 1.6875 shillings, and the American exchange rate has totaled 3.34375 yuan.

<h3>Decreasing Circulation of Chips, Unstable Gold Market, New High Reached at 2,470 Yuan, Intermediate Relaxation Still Suggests Easier to Rise Than Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash settlement ("烚赤") gray market saw price fluctuations not as large as the previous day, but the situation was still quite volatile, generally showing a trend of first rising, then falling, and finally rising again. The shift depended purely on the tightness of foreign exchange and the buying and selling situation. Initially, a certain gold firm (acting for the Huainan gang) aggressively increased its positions, causing the morning opening to rise to 2,420 yuan. Then, suddenly, news came that HSBC's listed exchange rates for British and American currencies had not changed, and at the same time, the foreign exchange rate was reported to have relaxed. Panic selling immediately surged, dropping the price to 2,385 yuan. After that, the price fluctuated around 2,400 yuan for quite some time. In the afternoon, news came that the foreign exchange rate had tightened again, triggering a buying frenzy, especially from securities firms and a certain bank (acting for a foreign bank), who were aggressively collecting. The market price soared, reaching new highs one after another, even reaching an unprecedented record of 2,470 yuan. However, before the evening close, the process of soaring was easier. Over the past two days, speculators with huge funds in the city have been aggressively accumulating and are still adding to their positions. The circulation of chips is dwindling, and foreign banks continue to buy aggressively. Finally, due to the emergence of cautious profit-takers, there was a slight decline, but the result was still a sharp increase of 60 yuan. The price has risen for four consecutive days, totaling a significant 346 yuan. Trading was brisk, reaching around 5,000 taels. Silver ornaments also rose successively by 6 yuan, listing at 248 yuan, an unprecedented high since the market's inception. Customs gold remained flat, while Chinese and English pure gold unanimously reversed its decline and rose.</p>
<p>Cash Settlement Soars, Another Sharp Increase of 60 Yuan</p>
<p>Since this morning, each tael (ten liang), due to the large fluctuations in the previous two days, all members were already present at the exchange at 9:00 AM. Initially, a money exchange business ("錢兌業") first called to buy at 2,380 yuan, followed by its gold firm (acting for the Huainan gang), which also tracked the purchase, especially as the foreign exchange rate was reported to be tight at that time, and buyers became increasingly eager, frantically raising prices against each other. However, sellers, aware of this frantic situation, held on even tighter, and the price soared, calling up to 1,400 yuan beyond the customs, but still had difficulty finding a counterpart. It was delayed until 9:35 AM when the market opened, and a certain gold firm bought 50 taels from a money exchange business, with the price rising to 2,420 yuan, a massive 40 yuan higher than the closing price of the previous night. Suddenly, news came that HSBC's listed rates were announced, with British and American exchange rates unchanged, and it was also heard that it was still willing to maintain the listed price, the buying frenzy immediately subsided, and everyone stopped aggressively buying, and immediately moved to fall, momentarily falling 9 yuan. A certain gold firm sold 50 taels to a peer at 415 yuan. Later, as the foreign exchange rate relaxed, buyers became even scarcer, and the decline sharply intensified. In an instant, it plunged into the 400 yuan range. A certain gold firm (acting for a wealthy individual coming to the market) aggressively sold over 200 taels to a securities firm and a certain gold firm, and the price fell back to 385 yuan. After that, a certain bank continued (acting for a foreign bank) to aggressively absorb at low prices, but because the money exchange business and the silversmith gang were still aggressively supplying, the market was quite flat, hovering between 390 yuan and 400 yuan. Around 11:00 AM, the bank bought 50 taels from the silversmith gang at 405 yuan. Later, a certain gold firm again acted for a wealthy individual coming to the market, and the silversmith gang also came to supply, gradually falling 20 yuan. The silversmith gang sold 50 taels to a money exchange business at 285 yuan. Around 11:30 AM, news came that the foreign exchange rate was tightening again, coupled with a certain bank aggressively buying for a foreign bank, the underlying trend was upward. Later, a certain bank bought 50 taels from the silversmith gang at 400 yuan as the noon closing price. It was heard that after the close, the bank continued to buy 200 taels, all at 405 yuan, supplied by the money exchange business and others. The afternoon opening was under the umbrella of a buying frenzy, and it was raised another 10 yuan, initially by a certain gold firm buying 50 taels from a peer at 430 yuan. Then, it leaped another 5 yuan, with the money exchange business mutually trading 50 taels at 435 yuan. Later, because a certain silversmith slightly sold, it fell back to 20 yuan. Around 3:00 PM, Defu Securities from the securities gang suddenly aggressively bought 300-400 taels, seeing that the foreign exchange closing rate was reported to be tight, sellers disappeared, and the price soared, even flying up 50 yuan. The securities gang reached a peak of 470 yuan, an unprecedented high. After 3:30 PM, those with abundant profits, those with abundant floating profits, all came to sell high cautiously, and then moved downwards, delaying until 4:00 PM when a money exchange business sold 50 taels to a silversmith gang, lowering the price to 2,440 yuan as the evening closing price. As a result, the price rose sharply again by 60 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous night. It has risen for four consecutive days, totaling 346 yuan. The daily fluctuation was also large, totaling 85 yuan. The cash firms' own-brand gold settlement price ("烚赤") was about 10 yuan higher, while the current standard gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the listed gold price. According to inquiries, there were very few transactions.</p>
<p>Silversmith Jewelry Gold Suspends at 248 Yuan</p>
<p>The initial price for silversmith jewelry gold was still suspended at 242 yuan per tael. At 12:10 PM, it was increased by two yuan. Later, at 2:55 PM, due to the cash settlement reaching an unprecedented record, it also leaped by four yuan. After that, there were no changes. Datong Bank listed at 248 yuan, while Xintong Bank listed at 246 yuan, buying in at 240 yuan, all creating unprecedented high prices since the market's inception.</p>
<p>British Pound Weakens, Pure Gold Also Rises One Penny</p>
<p>An eight-day London dispatch stated that British pure gold rose by one penny per ounce due to the weakening of the British pound, totaling 7 pounds, 8 shillings, and 5 pennies. As a result, the Central Bank's cash purchase price for Chinese currency also rose to 1,211 yuan and 6 jiao. The listed Customs gold remained flat, totaling 2 yuan, 3 jiao, 9 fen, and 4 li. The Shanghai Standard Gold price also rose by 7 jiao, reaching 1,206 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Returns Small Yuan Half</h3>
<p>Interbank Offered Rate Rises Two Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the discount rate for exchange-drawn bills suddenly saw a drop in the market. Initially, every ten yuan had fallen to as low as 51 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, but at noon it returned to 52 yuan and 2 jiao and a half. In the afternoon, suppliers increased again, and a drop was seen again. The final price was 50 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, a small return of one yuan and a half compared to the previous day. The money industry's interbank offered rate rose two fen, suspended at a high of one jiao and two fen, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Currencies Continue to Rise, British and American Gold Pounds Rise Seven Yuan and Four Jiao, Japanese Notes Still Below Legal Tender</h3>
<p>Yesterday, British pure gold rose half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate fell 1.875. Local foreign exchange banks were settling accounts very actively, and foreign banks' supply was not smooth, and the trend was already weak. As a result, the British exchange rate was 6.5 pennies, and the American exchange rate was 12.625. The cash settlement market opened, and prices continued to prosper, rising to 40 yuan. After entering the market, the situation was chaotic. Fluctuations were uncertain. The noon closing returned to stability, and the afternoon rising wind resumed strongly. Machine merchants were very interested and absorbed a lot, reaching a high peak of 2,470 yuan, continuing to break records. The evening closing slightly returned to 2,440 yuan, a further increase of 60 yuan compared to the previous day. After the closing, it was difficult to find a counterpart to buy at 2,460 yuan, and sellers were calling for 2,500 yuan. It can be seen that before the foreign exchange rate stabilizes, there are still high waves. The rising wind of foreign currencies is strong, and British and American gold pounds are rising together. Demand is very strong, but there are markets but no goods, and supply cannot be provided. British and American gold notes are absorbed very strongly, and supply is not smooth. Hong Kong notes and others are in great demand, and supply is scarce. Japanese gold notes are quite stable, with the evening market at 9 jiao, 9 fen, and 8 li. Korean notes are at 8 jiao and 4 fen. In reality, they have been greatly discounted, because foreign exchange and gold prices have been expensive by 20%, while Japanese notes are still below legal tender. It can be seen that the Japanese yen is not worth even 6.5 pennies. Transactions at the guild were quite prosperous. Hongchang sold, and Tongfeng bought Annam notes for 200 yuan. Huitong sold, and Tongfeng bought Annam notes for 100 yuan. Dingyuan sold, and Tongfeng bought Hong Kong notes for 100 yuan. Yongfeng sold, and Tongfeng bought Hong Kong notes for 300 yuan. Dingyuan sold, and Baoxiang bought American gold notes for 100 yuan, and also sold, and Zhenxing bought American gold notes for 100 yuan. Yesterday's market prices saw British and American gold pounds each rise 2 yuan, British gold notes rise 2 yuan and 6 jiao, American gold notes rise 5 jiao and 2 fen, Hong Kong notes rise 1 jiao and 3 fen, French franc notes rise 1 fen and 2 li, Singapore notes rise 1 jiao, Dutch notes rise 1 jiao and 1 fen, Annam notes rise 7 fen, Robi notes rise 8 fen, Canadian notes rise 4 jiao, Philippine notes rise 1 jiao and 5 fen, Italian notes rise 5 li, Australian gold notes rise 2 yuan and 5 jiao. Only German gold notes and Siamese notes did not change.</p>
<h3>Securities, Foreign Debt Still Weak, Foreign Stocks' Prominence Has Passed, Domestic Debt Hovers Between Several Jiao</h3>
<p>The securities gray market situation yesterday was still unable to rise, hovering between several jiao. The financial situation was volatile and unstable, while the debt market remained stable, as if it were unrelated to the environmental situation. It seemed that there were people controlling the market price from the middle. Several times it was raised, but still went downstream. Only Class E was the most firm due to the withdrawal relationship. The interest of large households has not waned until now. Starting today, Class E will be calculated without the middle. If large households raise it again, the market price will not be easily reduced. Yesterday's events: in the early morning, No. 20 Tongkang and others still raised prices. Class E reached 37 jiao, Class A reached 63 yuan, and Class B reached 5 yuan. Then the sellers surged, such as Tiansheng, Shunheng, No. 22, No. 8, and No. 16 were all selling. Although Tongshun, Runli, etc. all had purchases, the noon closing slightly returned. Only Class E was still 2 jiao and a half higher. In the afternoon, the trend was slightly softer. Class C broke the 3 yuan level again. Runli continued to buy. Tiansheng slightly compensated. No. 42 and No. 35 both had purchases. The sellers' momentum was thicker. Maoda, Datong, Suji, No. 13, and No. 52 were all selling. Retail investors also sold a lot. The market price continued to be small 3 jiao to 6 jiao, only Class E was only small 5 fen. The total number of transactions was approximately 700,000-800,000 yuan. A concise table is listed below.</p>
<p>Category | Highest | Lowest | Closing Price | Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|</p>
<p>Unified A | 62.00 | 62.20 | 62.30 | Down 0.35</p>
<p>Unified B | 55.00 | 54.25 | 54.30 | Down 0.60</p>
<p>Unified Internal | 53.45 | 52.75 | 52.75 | Down 0.45</p>
<p>Unified D | 52.80 | 52.20 | 52.25 | Down 0.50</p>
<p>Unified E | 53.70 | 53.15 | 53.20 | Down 0.05</p>
<p>96 | 6.30—— | 6.30 | Down 0.15</p>
<p>Stock trading: 50 shares of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange were traded, at a price of 39 yuan and 2 jiao and a half.</p>
<p>The demand for Rubber shares from the Public Industries Association was very active, while the trend of most industrial shares was even more uneven. English Zha Hua shares, Lang Gzhi shares, Rubber Trust shares, and Zha Hua Kang Sha shares were traded briskly, and prices rose. The strength of rubber stocks is not entirely due to the devaluation of legal tender, but it is really due to receiving good news from New York and Singapore, saying that the United States consumes a wide range of rubber, and also mentions that the manufacturers' plan to purchase goods cannot continue for long. For the rest, such as the International Trust stock price was 5 yuan, 3 jiao, and 5 fen, the telephone stock price was 110 yuan, the Jardine stock was stable, at 11 yuan and 4 jiao, the Kaiping stock was slightly soft in the morning due to the impact of falling prices in London, but later it firmly rose, and the closing price was 37 yuan, and 5 and a half percent of electricity was publicly traded in huge quantities, at a price of 89 yuan. China Business Corporation's 8% public bond seemed firm, at a price of 74 yuan and a half.</p>
<p>The listed market prices of London-based English Far East companies' stocks on the 8th of this month (Thursday) were affected by the sharp contraction of the Shanghai-London exchange rate. HSBC bank shares each fell 1 pound, with the price of London registered shares at 85 pounds and the price of Hong Kong registered shares at 86 pounds. Kaiping Coal Mine unregistered shares also fell by one shilling, with the price at 20 shillings and 6 pennies, and the rest were unchanged.</p>
<p>The listed market prices of London-based Chinese foreign debt on the 8th of this month (Thursday): The upper-end public bonds all fell endlessly, all creating new low prices. Crisp Bonds continued to fall 2 pounds, with the price at 30 pounds. Chinese-French US$500 public bonds with printed debt tickets also fell 1 pound, with the price at 59 pounds. English and German continuation and settlement funds of the British value tickets each fell half a pound, the former at 61 pounds and the latter at 43 pounds and a half. The lower-end railway public bonds were slightly stabilized. Only the Hubei-Guangdong Railway public bond continued to fall 1 pound, with the price of non-German-issued printed debt tickets at 19 pounds, and the price of German-English printed debt tickets at 18 pounds. The rest were unchanged.</p>

<h3>How Can a Beautiful Woman Be Satisfied with a Weak Husband?</h3>
<p>The fairest thing in the world is half a catty matched with eight taels. If half a catty is matched with nine taels, then an unfair phenomenon will be manifested. If it is unfair, then it will cry out, which is a matter of course. How can a beautiful woman marry a husband who is unattractive and weak? But in fact, "A skilled woman often sleeps with a clumsy husband," which is truly the only regret in the world!</p>
<p>A beautiful woman should marry a handsome and promising husband. That is a perfect match, truly a match made in heaven. Their love after marriage will definitely be sweet and lingering. They will have sons and daughters, a happy family, and enjoy unlimited happiness in life! If she marries a weak and incompetent husband, even if she uses all her love and affection, he will still be indifferent and hypocritical because he is powerless to do anything. How can this not make her feel discouraged? However, time flies like an arrow, and as she watches her youth pass by, how can she not feel heartbroken? Therefore, the tragedies between couples, such as quarrels, separation, divorce, adultery, elopement, and suicidal thoughts, are endless!</p>
<p>In physiological research, the physique of a man should be stronger than that of a woman, and his abilities should also be more abundant. Why is he so weak and incompetent? According to medical judgments, this is mostly caused by men committing self-pollution and seminal emission in their early years, or early marriage and indulgence in sexual desires, and unrestrained licentiousness. Because our appearance development and healthy life are greatly related to reproductive function, if the gonadal fluid that controls reproductive function is exhausted, then the metabolism will be reduced, the development function will be stagnant, the nerves will be exhausted, and symptoms such as incomplete development, premature aging, premature ejaculation, impotence, and neurasthenia will follow. Such a man, no matter how strong his body was originally, will definitely fall rapidly. Not only will the couple's life not be happy, but he will also resent himself and shorten his natural life, suffering the tragedy of separation and death!</p>
<p>Why does the wise husband of the times have to put himself in such a desperate situation? Today is a world of medical prosperity, and the above-mentioned symptoms already have special treatments that can be remedied. What is the special treatment? It is based on the principle of endocrine in the gonads, collecting potent animals, such as orangutans, apes, sea dogs, tigers, wolves, bears, and deer, and extracting gonadotropin from their bodies, and then replicating it into a preparation using scientific methods. Therefore, since this preparation was invented by Austrian physiologist Dr. Steinach, it is called "Steinach's Gonadotropin." The medicine is divided into male and female uses. After men take male "Gonadotropin," they can produce sperm, invigorate the kidneys, strengthen the brain, activate blood circulation, nourish nerves, promote development function, and regulate metabolism within 24 hours. Continuing to take it for three days, those with mild symptoms will recover, and those with severe symptoms will be relieved. After taking it for half a month, hundreds of diseases can suddenly disappear, and the body will become healthier. The famous German doctor Dr. Wansdling has compared this preparation with other preparations. As a result, the function of "Gonadotropin" is always more than five times that of other similar preparations, which shows the value and effectiveness of this preparation. However, those with seminal emission must also take "Himitot's Sperm-Solidifying Tablets" to solidify the sperm gate and prevent leakage, so that both the root and the branches can be treated, and the effect is even faster!</p>

<h3>The Influence and Remedy of Shrunken Breasts</h3>
<p>— American Medical Doctor Yao Chongpei</p>
<p>A beautiful woman in her prime,</p>
<p>Why are her breasts so shrunken?</p>
<p>Everyone laughs in social situations,</p>
<p>And feels lonely in her dreams!</p>
<p>There are many young women now who say they have beautiful faces, gentle personalities, and that their movements and thoughts are generous and agile, but they have a defect of shrunken breasts. They never take it to heart, and some, although they do take it to heart, always procrastinate and refuse to seek a remedy thoroughly, only seeking to cover up the shame temporarily, wearing some false masks, thinking that it is all over, but in fact, where is it so convenient? Try to look at a woman with shrunken breasts. No matter how beautiful and light cheongsam she wears, she only feels stupid and pitiful. Is there anything touching about her? Because the curvaceous beauty advocated by modern people completely requires towering breasts as the foundation. If the breasts are shrunken or as flat as a man's, then how can curves be formed? Therefore, even if she has first-class talent and beauty, she will be obscured and unmanifested because of this. If she has less talent and beauty, then not only will she be laughed at by everyone in social situations, but she will also suffer all kinds of contempt between husband and wife. As a result, her fate will be very tragic! The only remedy, according to world-renowned gynecologist Dr. Harvard Yuke Elvis and my experience, is universally recognized that taking the ovarian endocrine preparation female "Gonadotropin" is the most suitable and effective. The main reason for shrunken breasts is the dysfunction of the ovaries. If the ovarian secretion of potent animals is used to supplement the dysfunctional female body at this time, it will naturally show a great effect. Therefore, those who take this preparation for four weeks will have a more beautiful complexion, increased appetite, and the shrunken breasts will also gradually swell. If you continue to take it for more than six weeks, not only will the breasts be towering, but also all menstrual irregularities, leucorrhea, and lack of sensation will be completely cured, increasing love between couples, strengthening the body and preserving youth.</p>
<h3>The Most Reasonable Treatment for Seminal Emission</h3>
<p>— Venereal Disease Specialist Zhan Nianceng</p>
<p>Many people suspect that seminal emission in young people is difficult to cure. This is a misconception. If there is a good doctor here who can find the root cause of the disease and then prescribe the right medicine, then there is no way that it will not be effective day by day. As the saying goes, "The right medicine is like opening a lock." This is an easy thing to do. If you cannot find the root cause of the disease, or know the root cause but do not have the appropriate medicine, then it is very difficult. Therefore, we only admit the difficulty in measuring the root cause of seminal emission and the lack of effective medicines for treating seminal emission, but we do not admit that seminal emission is difficult to treat.</p>
<p>Facts speak louder than words. Many seminal emission patients who were immersed in the sea of suffering have regained the path of light after we prescribed the right medicine. Because according to our many years of experience, we deeply know that seminal emission is mostly caused by young people committing self-pollution and licentiousness, which weakens the sexual nerves and relaxes the sperm gate. The semen in the seminal vesicles cannot be controlled, and then seminal emission and spermatorrhea occur, and even premature ejaculation occurs. And with this phenomenon, it must be prevented as soon as possible. Otherwise, the sperm gate will become looser and looser with each emission, and the sexual nerves will become weaker and weaker with each emission, and then there will be the danger of sperm exhaustion, blood depletion, and hundreds of diseases! The most common ones are brain decay and forgetfulness, insomnia and palpitations, back pain, kidney deficiency and impotence, incomplete development, and premature aging. If you get to this point, not only will your future and happiness be lost, but also your vitality will be greatly lost, and your vitality will be dying!</p>
<p>The reasonable treatment for seminal emission is to start by consolidating the sperm gate and calming the nerves. "Himitot's Sperm-Solidifying Tablets," secretly prepared by German Dr. Himitot, completely has this function. Patients will be able to consolidate the sperm gate, calm the nerves, get a good night's sleep, reduce dreams, and seminal emission can be stopped on the same night. If seminal emission has already caused the above-mentioned symptoms, you must also take the gonadotropin preparation "Gonadotropin" to nourish the brain, kidneys, sperm, blood, and nerves, and continuing to take it will definitely cure all symptoms in a short period of time, so that the body will become healthier. If patients can come to this clinic in person to use electrotherapy injections and other methods, the effect will be even faster!</p>

<h3>A New Solution for Diffuse Leucorrhea</h3>
<p>After the poison of turbidity has been conquered by the newly invented special medicine "Da ○ Liu," its severity of epidemic is far less than before, and the one that has taken its place is the disease of gonorrhea. Not only is it as prevalent as syphilis used to be, but it is even worse than before. Because of the diffusion of gonorrhea, in many large cities, there are actually more men suffering from gonorrhea than healthy men, which is an undeniable fact. Therefore, we must conduct a thorough study on the treatment of gonorrhea in order to quickly eliminate this raging gonorrhea. However, as for most municipal doctors who stick to old methods, they often stubbornly adhere to a certain treatment method, such as using only one drug or one surgery, to deal with the ever-changing gonorrhea. How can they expect the gonorrhea to be cured day by day and return our happiness? Nowadays, doctors with a little bit of modern thinking feel that the treatment of gonorrhea, especially the need to deal with diffuse gonorrhea, is a matter of urgency. Now let's talk about it separately.</p>
<p>The diagnosis and treatment of stubborn and diffuse leucorrhea should be given the greatest effort to study. First of all, a precise diagnosis is made to determine whether it belongs to acute or chronic gonorrhea, including anterior and posterior urethritis, prostatitis, orchitis, joint inflammation, and cystitis, and then the right treatment is used so that it can be cured in the near future. For example, gonorrheal arthritis, orchitis, etc., must be treated with German Hee's serum injection in order to eliminate the widespread gonococcus, and mechanical therapy should not be used for cystitis in the early stage, but if it is too difficult to treat, washing can be performed. For prostatitis, vibration massage, Wen's cooling method, electrical massage, and suppositories can be selected. It can be seen that even for a certain symptom of gonorrheal, there are many treatments. Are those who stubbornly adhere to a certain treatment method or a certain inferior drug to deal with it not deceiving others? As for electrotherapy methods, the German filter electrolytic current therapy is even more effective in treating various diseases.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn: Speculation Exhausted, Yarn Market Fluctuates Wildly, While Da Wang Seizes the Opportunity to Sell off Stockpiled Yarn of Over 100,000 Bales</h3>
<p>Current situation: This morning, at the opening, attendees, realizing the current market is turbulent, mostly started trading early. The opening was relatively peaceful. Shuang Ma brand yarn was priced at 425.5 yuan per single bale, and foreign-stored yarn was at 466 yuan, an increase of 1.5 to 4 yuan compared to the previous day. However, the Mu Yang (Shepherd) brand, priced at 492.5 yuan, suddenly moved. Soon after, buying momentum surged, creating an unbearable din. Shouting was chaotic. In an instant, 20 bales of Shuang Ma foreign-stored yarn were priced at 470 yuan, and single bales at 461 yuan. Unexpectedly, after the high price, some profits were cashed out, and a downward trend abruptly started. Foreign-stored Shuang Ma fell again to 463 yuan, and single bales to 454 yuan, a difference of 6 or 7 yuan in a flash. It is conceivable that there are many who are stirring up trouble. The closing was flat. In the afternoon, the opening was still slow, and rumors resurfaced, saying that the situation for stocks and gold was becoming favorable. The market price rose step by step. The price of 20 bales of Shuang Ma foreign-stored yarn rose again to 470 yuan, and single bales to 461 yuan, with buying difficult. However, actual transactions were still scattered as usual, while the mood was unusually heated. The closing price for 20 bales of Shuang Ma spot goods was 470 yuan, and single bales at 461.5 yuan. It is found that a total of 3,850 bales were purchased by various trading groups today. The market price: 10-count Shuang Ma yarn rose 7 yuan, Shuang Qiu (Double Globe) rose 7 yuan, Mu Yang rose 1.5 yuan, Wu Fu (Five Blessings) rose 3 yuan, 10-count yarn was flat, and 32-count single yarn tended to fall. Today, 440 pieces of cotton yarn were shipped to Tianjin, 70 pieces to Yantai, 955 pieces to Shantou, and 345 pieces to Hong Kong. The amounts purchased by various trading groups are listed below:</p>
<p>Same trade: 2,710 bales Hong Kong: 470 bales</p>
<p>Shantou: 105 bales Yunnan: 445 bales</p>
<p>Wenzhou: 10 bales Inland: 110 bales</p>
<p>Total: 3,850 bales</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market continued to rise. "Piqiu" (speculative) trading was very active, but actual sales in various regions showed no appetite. Most people are speculating on exchange bills, resulting in extreme volatility. Yueqin yarn rose to 398 yuan in the morning, then fell to 392 yuan, and then rose again to 396 yuan in the afternoon.</p>
<p>According to sources, warehouses of various Shanghai banks and foreign firms are filled with stockpiles of yarn and cloth, exceeding hundreds of thousands of bales. Recent transshipment and hoarding are not included. Yarn factories are taking advantage of high prices to sell some of their inventory to meet demand.</p>
<h3>Slight Movement by Manufacturers, Cotton Market Expanding</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton transactions stalled, existing orders sufficient for three months.</p>
<p>Trading in both Chinese and foreign spot cotton showed growth, but factory purchases remained moderate. Apart from Shen Xin, Hong Zhang, and Xin Sheng factories having slight needs, others showed no activity. Japanese factories, both domestic and Shanghai, purchased several hundred bales of Chinese cotton, due to its pure white color. Similar to Indian cotton, domestic traders were also stimulated by foreign markets, showing strong interest in trading and actively buying. As a result, market prices soared. Only 106 bales of Tonghua cotton arrived from Northern Jiangsu. The current situation of spot cotton is recorded below.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Shanghai Chinese and foreign yarn factories have purchased near- and long-term foreign cotton, with exchange bills settled upon purchase. The amount is said to be around 800,000 bales, sufficient for three months of use by the factories.</p>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: New York cotton prices initially rose due to positive news from He Wuqing and active new buyers, as well as higher spot prices. Later, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Henry Wallace's meeting with Roosevelt, strongly advocating export subsidies, triggered buying, resulting in a closing increase of 3-5 points per pound. India was closed, with no change expected. Egypt rose over 20 points per pound.</p>
<p>Shanghai foreign cotton trading: Yesterday, the black market exchange rate was still chaotic. Smaller factories, with weaker financial resources and thinner inventories, had sold too much cotton yarn earlier, fearing difficulties in purchasing cotton in the future. Yesterday, they reluctantly bought several thousand pieces of Indian cotton. All foreign cotton was sold by traders after making substantial profits. Foreign cotton firms have not been dealing in single bales since Wednesday. Therefore, foreign firms will continue trading after the foreign exchange stabilizes.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: National Sugar Tight, Coarse White Also Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market, according to a London telegram, increased by 1.75 pence for August, to 6 shillings and 11.25 pence. December increased to 6 shillings and 1 penny, and March of next year increased to 6 shillings and 1.5 pence, all up 1 penny. A Dutch telegram reported 1,500 bags of coarse sand were settled at 8.45 Dutch guilders for July-August. Therefore, the Shanghai Sugar Association's price trends remained firm. Spot 24 coarse sugar rose 4 jiao at the local warehouse, to 29.4 yuan, and rose 2 jiao at foreign warehouses, to 29 yuan. Transit goods initially traded at the original price of 20.7 yuan for 1,600 bags, and then rose 3 jiao to 21 yuan for 200 bags. Taikoo granulated white sugar, B grade spot goods, were initially priced flat, with 1,200 bags sold at 28.5 yuan, and then rose to 28.8 yuan, totaling 300 bags. Dutch red sugar remained unchanged, with transit goods trading at 13.7 yuan for 100 bags. Local cotton white sugar rose half a yuan, with Zhen Ji No. 1 at 28.5 yuan, No. 2 at 28 yuan, No. 3 at 27.5 yuan, and No. 4 at 27 yuan. Domestic sugar was gradually tightening, with Chaozhou sugar at 14 yuan and Jian sugar at 14.1 yuan, totaling 326 bags. Cotton red sugar was at 15.8 yuan to 15.45/46 jiao, over 300 bags. Huanggang ordinary Qing sugar was at 14.8 yuan, and Huizhou white sugar at 24.6 yuan, totaling over 100 bags.</p>
<h3>Grain: Flour Mill Prices Rise Again by One Jiao</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the market showed strength. Since the tightening of foreign exchange, goods directly or indirectly related to foreign goods have generally risen sharply, especially the soaring gold prices, which have raised expectations. Yesterday, various mills continued to refuse customer orders, while small retail transactions in the market were still being supplied as usual, but mill prices had increased by another jiao. No. 2 flour rose from 4.45 yuan to 4.55 yuan. It is heard that medium-grade foreign flour also rose from 4.43/44 yuan to 4.55 yuan, with higher-grade brands requiring an additional 5 fen to 1 jiao. Currently, with new wheat coming to market and foreign wheat pouring in, the market is not looking good. However, the sharp fluctuations in foreign exchange have created an opportunity for rising prices. In addition, the Beiyang group is actively purchasing and packaging foreign flour, and also shows strong appetite for domestic flour. According to customer sources, after initially refusing customer sales in the morning, a batch of transactions was made in the evening market at a price of 4.55 yuan.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, there was no formal market for new wheat. New samples from various production areas were continuously sent to Shanghai, pitched to flour mills and foreign merchants. However, with foreign wheat arriving in large quantities and new wheat being damp and soft, it was not welcomed by manufacturers. Purchases were moderate. It is rumored that two batches of new Nanjing wheat, totaling 140 bags, had arrived. It was said that the price was being kept secret, and they were sold directly to the factory at a price of 5.7 yuan. Since both buyers and sellers remained silent, the market was not publicly announced.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, 13,500 bags of flour are being shipped to Tianjin, another 1,000 bags to Weihaiwei, and another 17,000 bags to Shantou, along with 400 bags of bran to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>2,000 Tons of Foreign Rice Settled</p>
<p>###</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Yesterday, the market suddenly changed unexpectedly. It is rumored that 2,000 tons of Saigon rice agreed upon by grain merchants were fully settled and returned yesterday due to the impact of the suspension of foreign exchange sales. A surplus of 56,000 yuan was gained from the foreign exchange settlement, but 31,000 yuan had to be paid for shipping and all losses, leaving the grain merchants with a net surplus of 25,000 yuan. Due to the above news, the current foreign rice market has also been affected. Current foreign rice inventory is less than 10,000 bags. With the source cut off, everyone is expecting prices to rise. Retail prices for ten or twenty bags rose by 3 jiao, selling at 19.3 yuan to 19.35 yuan, while one or two hundred bags were asking for 19.5/5.6 yuan, with delivery yet to be settled.</p>
<p>Glutinous Rice: Due to the sudden release of foreign glutinous rice, the price fell by more than 2 jiao.</p>

<h3>Dredging the Mouth of the Wusong River</h3>
<p>The Wusong River mouth, i.e., the Suzhou Creek project, at that time, a dam was built west of the Great King Temple. The area to the east was not heavily silted, and the river was wide, making dam construction difficult, so dredging was not undertaken. Foreign merchants have been discussing this for some time. Now, Prefect Li has come to Shanghai to inspect the bund and embankment project. Consular officials and others invited him to Yihua Wharf, where they boarded a small steamship. Experts from the Public Works Bureau, familiar with water management, measured the depth of the river to the original dam site west of the New Gate. It is said that the river mouth will be dredged again. This decision will use steam-powered dredging machines and will not involve building dams.</p>
<h3>Presenting an Umbrella for Virtuous Governance</h3>
<p>The ban on female waitresses in the concession area has pleased gentlemen, scholars, and merchants alike. Now, gentlemen and merchants in the concession area, in gratitude for the virtuous governance of Consul-General Medhurst and others, embroidered a "Ten Thousand People's Canopy" and presented it to the consulate last Saturday. It was graciously received, with warm and respectful hospitality. Since Consul-General Medhurst took office in Shanghai, he has protected the shops and residents within the concession area in an exemplary manner, earning the trust of the people. This time, regarding female waitresses and opium dens, upon receiving a notice from the Daotai, he immediately assisted in banning them completely. The Daotai has couplets praising his virtue. Since the benefits have been shared by all, it is fitting to praise Consul-General Medhurst and present the canopy.</p>
<h3>Edict on Burning Books</h3>
<p>Strange! The new policies of Japan have even led to the burning of books. Yesterday, a friend returned from Japan, carrying a heavy load of books. When asked, he said, "These are the ashes of what remains." Surprised, I asked why. He replied, "Japan has long admired China's culture and writings, and has purchased books from ancient to modern times. Those shelved and labeled are all rare editions. Now, the ruler intends to use Western writing and has banned Chinese books. It is said that hundreds of thousands of volumes have been gathered and destroyed. Therefore, I took them from the collections of scholars and book collectors to bring them back to China, to avoid another Qin Shi Huang burning of books."</p>

<h3>The Price Increase of Park Tickets</h3>
<p>— Xin Meng</p>
<p>Shanghai is so crowded, and the air is so polluted. Everyone is happy to go for a walk if there is a park nearby, especially in the hot weather, when parks are the best place to cool off. Therefore, people living near parks usually buy several long-term tickets per family to visit the park every day.</p>
<p>Originally, long-term tickets were not color-coded and were the same for both men and women. So, as long as you bought a ticket, anyone could enter, regardless of gender. But since the year before last, the colors for men and women have been different. This means that even a small family of husband and wife must each buy a long-term ticket.</p>
<p>Last year, the method changed again. The long-term tickets that were valid for all parks were increased to two yuan per ticket, while individual tickets were only one yuan. So-called individual tickets meant that if you bought a ticket that only allowed you to visit Zhaofeng Park, then it would not be valid for the Bund Park or the Jiaozhou Park, and you would have to buy temporary tickets.</p>
<p>According to the Public Concession Park regulations, the validity period of a long-term ticket is one year, from June 1st to May 31st of the following year. Now is the time to renew the tickets, but the long-term tickets valid for all parks are going to be increased to three yuan again. If Zhaofeng Park is excluded, then it remains one yuan as before.</p>
<p>This method was proposed by the Works Committee to the Board of Directors of the Public Concession. The reason given was that, after the concession became crowded, the number of visitors to Zhaofeng Park increased daily, creating an unprecedented new record. With so many visitors, the park's facilities are inevitably being damaged, and some people are dragging chairs, trampling on flowers, and throwing melon rinds and fruit peels everywhere. In other words, the price is being increased to limit visitors, and some even suggested raising it to five yuan per ticket. On the other hand, Jiaozhou Park and the Bund Park are not being increased because there are not many visitors.</p>
<p>This method is somewhat unsatisfactory to us. The reason why Zhaofeng Park has so many visitors is because the park is large, the open spaces are clear and fresh, and the facilities are relatively perfect. As for Jiaozhou Park, the place is small, there are not many trees, and the air in the Bund Park is as polluted as in the downtown area. The reason for having parks in the concession is to provide residents with rest and recreation. The air in the concession is polluted everywhere, and it is natural for people to be able to go to a park like Zhaofeng Park to clear their minds and benefit their health. But the price has been increased to three times the original price.</p>
<p>If this decision to increase prices is to reduce park visitors, then the concession authorities are paying attention to the health problems of residents, giving vaccinations and inoculations, and have always actively promoted them. If they believe that regular visits to the park can also reduce disease and benefit health, then it seems somewhat contradictory. If it is said that visitors intentionally damage flowers and plants, I can say that this is only a small number. Educated people would never do this. For example, parks do not allow picking of any flowers. If someone picks a flower, they will be punished. We have never seen a visitor picking flowers. Therefore, for visitors who do not follow the rules, you can increase the number of police officers and implement strict surveillance. In short, we believe that this decision to increase prices is unnecessary. If the price increase really prevents many people from visiting the park, then it is not the original purpose of establishing the park. On the other hand, people who visit the park should, of course, be vigilant and not damage any flowers or plants in the park, and not violate the rules of the park, so that people leave us with a good impression, which is also an important thing.</p>
<h3>Reply to a Copper Coin Collector</h3>
<p>— The Editor</p>
<p>Your "Confession" has been received. If your "Confession" is indeed true, then the article "Where Have Shanghai's Copper Coins Gone?" from the fourth day is unrelated to you. Please do not feel "ashamed" or "uneasy."</p>
<p>According to your "Confession," because of unemployment, you are collecting copper coins from various places for a certain company to earn a small profit. The reason why the company wants you to collect copper coins is to cope with the "change" needed in the daily sales department. Since it is to cope with "change," then these copper coins are still circulating in the market. But the current problem is that Shanghai is experiencing a large shortage of copper coins. This shows that there is another group of "copper coin collectors" who are transporting the copper coins to another place—this is also the reason that you call "unknown" in your "Confession." And all I can tell you is just that.</p>
<p>But you also need to pay attention to whether this so-called "certain company" is, as you imagine, only buying copper coins to "cope with the change" in the sales department, and asking you to collect copper coins. I hope you can find a better job, and at the same time "pay attention" to your current job.</p>
<h3>Thoughts on "Made For Each Other"</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"Made For Each Other"</p>
<p>After watching "Made For Each Other," my heart felt as if it was weighed down by a heavy lead block, and the shadow of James Stewart was always looming before my eyes. Is this poor little clerk really going to end up like "Made For Each Other": a harmonious mother-in-law and daughter-in-law; a promotion to a senior clerk; and the re-establishment of a happy and complete family?</p>
<p>Looking around us (naturally, I include myself), we can find the shadow of James Stewart on almost everyone's face. Their dreams, like the passing of time, have left no trace, and all the unfortunate encounters are pressing him step by step. Their ending is unimaginable?</p>
<p>I think every James Stewart who shares the same fate will feel the same as me after watching this play.</p>
<p>The reason why "Made For Each Other" is so deeply touching is first and foremost that it has found such a realistic subject matter. Second, it is the superb acting skills of James Stewart and Carole Lombard. And the outstanding skills of the director, John Cromwell, are the biggest key to helping this film succeed.</p>
<p>John Hammerson, the assistant in James Stewart's law firm, has achieved the greatest success. He is loyal to his duties and cowardly. He practices his resignation speech all night long, but when he sees the lawyer Doolittle, he mumbles and dares not open his mouth, but instead receives the news of a pay cut. And the joy of being immersed in love, and the excitement of becoming a father for the first time, can all express the character of such a person.</p>
<p>Carole Lombard, contrary to her past style, plays Hammerson's wife. She is gentle, considerate, and loves her husband. And in family quarrels, after the child falls ill, her anger and grief, the characters who are completely different before and after, surpass her previous acting skills.</p>
<p>John Cromwell's outstanding skills can be described in several aspects:</p>
<p>First: The grasp of character. The character of Hammerson, from the beginning of his engagement with Jean, is always portrayed very vividly. Such as holding a photo to the law firm, and asking Doolittle for a honeymoon trip, the family life after marriage ... writing a small clerk who is just immersed in a sweet life, and is kind and lovely. After that, all misfortunes followed one after another. When the cowardly Hammerson was forced to a dead end, he could only scold loudly, and drink. The director portrayed Hammerson's character from every small action.</p>
<p>Second: The grasp of emotional atmosphere. This can also be divided into two parts, the first part is light and lively, and the back part is in strong contrast, and every scene tightly pulls the audience's heart, and refuses to let go.</p>
<p>Third: Focus on economic oppression, such as debt collection at banquets; paying hospital bills after giving birth (stamping the "Paid" stamp on the bill); borrowing 5,000 yuan from Doolittle after the child is sick, and so on. Explaining what caused the plight of this young couple from this aspect is very moving.</p>
<p>Other aspects, such as the simplicity of the picture weaving, the use of lens angles and lighting, all help the wooden film achieve artistic success.</p>
<p>Since the reopening of the Great Shanghai Theater, this is the best play, and because the past selection criteria were too low, "Made For Each Other" did not attract the attention of the audience, which is a great regret. However, this also gives a good lesson: specializing in "business eyes" is not the best business method.</p>
<h3>After the Rain</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: Recognizing Fellow Villagers in an Old Mortar-and-Pestle Life, Attaching to Power and Wealth in a New Aristocracy</p>
<p>Zhao Letian later gave up on that idea. How could a patriotic man keep the two words "love" lodged in his heart? How could he constantly keep a beautiful figure in his mind? He practiced shooting, and every shot hit the mark. He was originally the best shooter. Later, he joined a certain volunteer army, and became a machine gunner, and also the most skilled machine gunner. Other machine gunners would fire their machine guns wildly, even without seeing the enemy's shadow. Zhao Letian refused to do so. He said, "We must cherish our bullets, and we cannot fire our guns aimlessly. You only hear the sound of 'tat-tat-tat' for a while, and you don't know how much value this burst of sound costs. Our military supplies are not easy to come by, and we cannot waste them." Because Zhao Letian aimed accurately and was good at concealment, the enemy did not know where his bullets were coming from. He would gently fire a few bursts, without continuing for too long continuously. But there would be people falling to the ground, one here and one there. Several of his team members were used to hearing Zhao Letian's machine gun. They knew it was his as soon as they heard it. "Tat-tat-tat, tat-tat-tat," the sound was short, sharp, and concise, unlike those long and weak bursts. This was because he did not want to waste bullets, and knew where to stop. Later, he was promoted to a captain. When he fought against others, he would still fire the machine gun himself. Once, there was a night attack, and they were also trying to seize the enemy's heavy vehicles. Their team had only two or three hundred men, but they were scattered everywhere, ambushing on all sides. The enemy had an equal number of men, and their military equipment was much better than ours. But in the dark of dusk, they did not know how many men we had. Our men were constantly moving around, because we were familiar with the terrain. For example, after firing a few shots here, we would quickly move over there and fire a few shots again, pretending to be many in number. Our machine guns were also constantly moving around, "tat-tat-tat" here, "tat-tat-tat" there, causing the enemy to run around blindly, not knowing where to go. At that time, many of them were killed by us. Especially Zhao Letian's machine gun, he was also constantly moving around, firing a few bursts of "tat-tat-tat," and he would see several black shadows arching over and unable to get up. But he didn't know that there was a soldier, holding a hand grenade in his hand, when he was hit by a machine gun bullet in the shoulder, he saw a flash of light in the bushes in front of him, and he threw the hand grenade over. He originally wanted to destroy the machine gun, but with a "bang," the machine gun was not hit, but the hand grenade bounced up from the ground and injured Zhao Letian's foot. It was truly said:</p>

<h3>A Few Opinions on the Theater Movement</h3>
<p>— Yang Fei</p>
<p>Discarding the old plays that are outdated in terms of awareness, low in taste, commonplace, and boring, and that includes even improved Peking opera, Cantonese opera, and even civilized plays. As long as the content is connected with reality, can inspire the audience's sense of justice, the dialogue and lyrics are relatively popular and easy to understand, and the makeup and scenery adopt new-style techniques, then a progressive and meaningful new path will be opened in the theater world.</p>
<p>Therefore, we do need the dramas written and directed by Ah Ying, Yu Ling, Li Jianwu, etc. We also need the improved Peking opera directed by Ouyang Yuqian, and the improved Cantonese opera arranged by the Yong'an Theater Company (such as "The Story of Jing Ke," although the material is poorer).</p>
<p>I hope that these many new drama activists can cooperate, exchange experiences, and discuss improvements with each other. It is best to perform in alternating venues or in the same venue (like at the New Year's Day Artist Reunion at the Franco-Chinese Drama and Art Society) to attract audiences from multiple directions, so that audiences can exchange the money they spend on foreign films and the energy they spend on frivolous entertainment for some nourishing spiritual food.</p>
<p>Recently, Yu Ling's adaptation of "The Whole City in Storm" was performed at the New Light Theater, and the "New Experimental Theater" held a weekly performance of "Tartuffe." The drama world, which has always stood at the forefront of the theater movement, is still striving in such a thorny isolated environment. It is worthy of our admiration and joy. However, I feel that the drama movement must also take into account the audience who have inherited their tastes and habits. If we want to win them over, then the drama world's lone struggle is not enough. We should unite with those in the old drama world to achieve "the unity of the Shanghai drama community, to jointly discuss and promote the new development of the theater movement."</p>
<p>I hope that this matter can be realized quickly.</p>
<p>Finally, I also hope that my fellow countrymen who love to watch dramas or movies will always be vigilant and not just send their money and energy to meaningless entertainment that numbs the soul. Save it and go see a new drama with a clearer message, in order to obtain some meaningful entertainment!</p>

<p>Madam Li Qinian, a renowned film star from South China, recently held a charity sale of several hundred of her own photographs in Hong Kong, with the proceeds used to aid refugees. As a leading star with the largest audience in the region, Madam Li's portraits were cherished by film fans, and her charitable act garnered widespread sympathy. Consequently, the event was a great success, benefiting many refugees.</p>
<p>Motivated by Charity, numerous photographers in Shanghai, inspired by Madam Li's righteous and commendable actions, sought to emulate her. Recently, dozens of individuals, including Du Ao, Weng Feipeng, Mu Yilong, Li Shifang, Ma Yonghua, and He Zuoming, jointly initiated and expanded the organization of the "Chinese Film Photograph Photographers Association." They plan to compile over a thousand works and hold a grand "Exhibition of Film Star Photographs."</p>
<p>Organizational Details. After several days of meetings, the essential arrangements for this event have been agreed upon. Regarding the organization, Du [blank space], Mu Yilong, and Li Shifang, among seven others, have been appointed as preparation committee members, with Wu Liande taking charge of the overall coordination. Internal affairs are divided into six sections: general affairs, collection, administration, finance, publicity, etc., each managed by dedicated personnel working collaboratively. Simultaneously, they have requested the assistance of the Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center in co-organizing the event. All proceeds from the sales will be donated to the center's expenses.</p>
<p>Exhibition Details. The exhibition will feature photographs in nine categories, including photo albums, enlarged photographs, grouped small photographs, film stills, color photographs, color-printed paintings, and slides, with single-person photographs of Chinese film stars as the main focus. This category includes stars such as Bai Die, Gu Lanjun, Yuan Meiyun, Chen Yunshang, Jin Yan [blank space], Gao Zhanfei, and Zhao Dan, as well as early stars like Yang Naimei and Zhang Zhiyun, and deceased stars like Ruan Lingyu, Ye Juanjuan, and Lu Lixia, totaling over one hundred individuals. All exhibited photographs will be standardized at twelve inches, with a uniform price of four yuan per print.</p>
<p>Star Autographs. The exhibition is scheduled to last for ten days. During this period, special arrangements have been made to feature enlarged color photographs of ten leading female stars, each with a beautifully framed display. Each day, a different star will be invited to attend and sign the special photographs for purchasers. The price for each of these photographs will be at least fifty yuan, and only one print per star will be offered to ensure exclusivity.</p>
<p>Exhibition Dates Confirmed. The exhibition venue has been tentatively set at the fourth-floor auditorium of the New World Company, with the dates scheduled from July 18th to July 27th, a total of ten days. After the conclusion of the Shanghai exhibition, all exhibits will be transported to Hong Kong for another grand exhibition.</p>
<p>All Renowned Photographers in Shanghai have demonstrated a commendable sense of justice, using their collective strength to hold a large-scale charity sale. Their enthusiasm is highly admirable. Film star photographs are popular among film fans, and this collective effort, combined with Madam Li Qinian's individual exhibition, will undoubtedly yield much greater results. It is expected that the outcome will be excellent, bringing immeasurable benefits to the refugees.</p>
<h3>White Residence Opera Performance Canceled</h3>
<p>Telegrams Dispatched to Inform All Celebrated Performers. Madam White to Leave Shanghai to Avoid Birthday Festivities.</p>
<p>This publication has reported on the preparations for the White Residence opera performance in detail, and everyone eagerly hoped for its realization. However, yesterday, reporters learned that the performance has been canceled. According to a well-informed source, the White Residence, after careful consideration, cited several reasons. First, relatives advised against excessive extravagance during these times. Second, the extensive publicity made logistical arrangements difficult. Third, the approaching birthday left insufficient time for preparation. Therefore, they canceled the opera performance. Telegrams have been sent to renowned performers in Beiping and Tianjin, requesting them not to travel south. Madam White and Mr. White are scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 13th to avoid the birthday celebrations, destination not yet announced. It is said that Mr. White is German, which explains why he is unfamiliar to most people.</p>
<h3>Continental Swimming Pool to Host Swimming Competition of Movie Stars</h3>
<p>— Gao Feng</p>
<p>The Continental Swimming Pool, which has caused a sensation throughout Shanghai, coincidentally opened yesterday on one of the hottest days of the year. Despite the scorching sun melting the asphalt, Jing'an Temple Road remained crowded with people heading toward the Continental Swimming Pool. The opening ceremony featured music performed by the Luoping Dance Troupe from the Celestial Music Palace. Soon, lively music filled the air from the loudspeakers, and many Chinese and Western swimming enthusiasts, who had been waiting eagerly by the poolside, plunged into the water, creating a cacophony of sounds. In an instant, the large swimming pool was filled to capacity.</p>
<p>As I circled the surrounding stands, I noticed that numerous male and female movie stars and Peking Opera performers were occupying the small round tables, sipping cold drinks. At this moment, I met the managers of the pool, Mr. Lu Jiajun and Mr. Wu Ruisheng, who informed me that they are actively planning a swimming competition for movie stars. If this plan materializes, this vast aquatic paradise will surely be packed with countless film fans and swimming enthusiasts! This year, the Continental Swimming Pool has emerged in a new form before the five million residents of the isolated island. Its sensation is not accidental, but inevitable.</p>
<h3>Celestial Music Palace Adds Night Garden</h3>
<p>—Rental of Celebration Halls</p>
<p>Since Mr. Xie Baosheng, a well-known figure in Shanghai, took over the Celestial Music Palace, half a year has passed. The arrangement of lighting, adjustment of music, selection of dancers, preparation of food and drinks, and training of staff have all been meticulously studied and diligently managed. Its supremacy in the East is certainly not a matter of luck. High-class ladies have come to deeply appreciate this pleasure palace, and the visits are constant. As a result, the business of the dance hall is booming, breaking all previous records. Recently, Mr. Xie has added a night garden to the front of the square, laying out lawns, planting flowers and trees, and adding cold drinks, snacks, and wine, to promote summer entertainment and enhance the dance atmosphere for the guests. The arrangements are now complete and will soon open. At that time, with carriages and horses passing by, there will surely be a grand scene. In addition, because of its central location, convenient transportation, and magnificent architecture, the dance hall does not hold social tea dances on Sundays, so it is often rented for weddings or birthday celebrations. The China Group Wedding Service has held all its group weddings in the dance hall. If you need a grand hall, you can contact them directly, and they will certainly be satisfied.</p>
<h3>"Farmer's Song," One Scene</h3>
<h3>Chess Garden</h3>
<p>— Compiled by Bao Zibo, Edited by Lu Chengzu</p>
<p>Opening Method, 43rd Game</p>
<p>Black Moves First</p>
<p>Belongs to Flying Horse Against Central Cannon</p>
<p>Movements Follow the Previous Game</p>
<p>Cannon Eight Advances to Five, Pawn Six Advances to Five, Horse Seven Advances to Six. Explanation: In this situation, sending the central pawn and then retreating the chariot three spaces, capturing the pawn, is also excellent. Compared to using the hole-heart cannon to attack the pawn in the previous game, the cannon attack is stronger than capturing with the chariot. The goal of chariot two advances to three is to suppress the horse. In this way, one chariot can control three pieces. Capturing the pawn by retreating the chariot three spaces seems like a waste of talent.</p>
<p>Cannon Eight Advances to Five, Pawn Six Advances to Five. This is inevitable. Horse Seven Advances to Six shows that retreating the chariot frees the horse. Although both sides do not lose initiative at this time, the cannon strike is bolder. The reason for using the chariot retreat capture method in this game is only to allow learners to know the outline.</p>

<p>Shadows of the Dance World (26)</p>
<p>— Xiao Tian</p>
<h3>Special on Shu Yunzhu</h3>
<p>Anyone who wanders through the Celestial Music Palace probably knows about the Big Hangzhou and the Little Hangzhou. Big Hangzhou is approaching her prime, and her worldly wisdom is well-rounded. Has she recently left the dance hall to marry or retire? Outsiders cannot know. Little Hangzhou's stage name is Shu Yunlan. At twenty years old, she has grown up and has some worldly wisdom, but her innocence has not completely disappeared. She is usually quite reserved, only occasionally revealing her true self to acquaintances. Many of my friends enjoy dancing with her. Generally, Little Hangzhou's actions follow those of Big Hangzhou. (26) After Big Hangzhou's retirement from the dance hall, Little Hangzhou often has to take on the role alone. And succeeding to Little Hangzhou's position, there is also a Little Little Hangzhou.</p>
<p>Little Little Hangzhou, there was no name for her in the dance world at first. I had no name for her, so I named her myself. Her stage name is Shu Yunzhu. Some say she is Little Hangzhou's younger sister. Little Hangzhou herself acknowledges that she is her younger sister. But looking at their appearance, it does not seem so. Little Hangzhou calls her Ah Hui. Guests who jokingly call her Ah Hui get a little upset, saying, "You can call me Ah Zhu." In short, dance girls' family matters often have unspeakable secrets. One should pity them and not force an exploration. Or perhaps I know it but should not reveal it. If so, that is the gentlemanly way.</p>
<p>Yunzhu is tall and slender, about twenty-eight or twenty-nine years old. She does not adorn herself. One cannot call her beautiful, but one cannot deny her charm. She is innocent and lively, like a forget-me-not, like a flower that understands words. She has Charlie Chaplin's humor and Shirley Temple's wit. My friend Mr. Song appreciates her very much, without any hint of male-female thoughts. Yunzhu has a large capacity for alcohol and is good at singing. When she is tipsy, she starts singing loudly, regardless of the people sitting next to her. Both Chinese and Western songs popular in the dance hall are no problem. Even Shanghai opera, Suzhou ballads, Peking opera, and even Shaoxing opera, she mostly has the next line if you have the first. If you happen to be feeling down, you might as well invite her for a meal, which can be worth a dose of anti-anxiety medicine. Usually, she does not pay much attention to tickets, but occasionally, when she eats dumplings, she also knows how to frown, probably fearing criticism. She dances tea dances at the Great China, and tonight she dances at the Metropolis with her sister, sitting at the neighboring table with the Cao Suqin sisters.</p>

<p>Yu Shuyan's Biggest Reason for Not Wanting to Perform</p>
<p>I was sitting alone in the place where Weisheng was dressing up and chatting with him, but I didn't want to stand there with them as a punishment. Who knew that after waiting for a while, Ma Lianliang, dressed as Fan Zhongyan, appeared on stage. I quickly asked the people backstage, "What's going on? Is Shuyan going to perform or not?" Unexpectedly, they were even more confused than I was. They all said that Yu San's words are never certain. His skills on stage are all done by people, but his private personality is not human. Loyalty, filial piety, and integrity are all sung on stage, so privately, he is unbenevolent and unjust. All in all, one play takes at most an hour, and he earns three or four thousand yuan, and he still has to maintain his airs, relying on the boss's pleasure. In the past, Boss Tan's appearances were only two hundred yuan each, and he was a bit over the top. After hearing this old stagehand's discussion, I felt that something was unreliable today. I wanted to call the few people who came with me to leave together, but the entrance and exit doors were full of people. An actor dressed as a fierce god was shouting in the crowd, "Everyone, please make way, it's my turn to go out," pushing and shouting, and it took him a long time to squeeze out. I thought this situation was not right, so I'd better slip away alone. The next day, I saw Mr. Chuan and learned that Little Yu had cheated people again, making the family and the male and female guests very angry. That day, because the stage was full of people, the people in the audience were affected. Among them, a modern young lady wearing high heels stood for half a day, and of course she was tired. In an unguarded moment, she was pushed by someone and almost fell onto the stage. Coincidentally, Lianliang's musician Zhao Guiyuan was playing "Flat Erhuang" when she bumped into him, and the erhu fell to the ground, and all the strings broke. Although the spectators could forgive them for this special situation, Lianliang was very bad-tempered and immediately started scolding. Later, Zhao Guiyuan was replaced by Yang Baozhong, because of this choice of the zither (not Bo Ya) breaking the strings.</p>
<p>Beiping is the place where [blank space] has lived for generations, and it is very close, but he can repeatedly change his mind at the last minute, causing great disappointment. How can anyone be sure whether he will attend a certain house party in Shanghai, which is far away? No one can say for sure that he will come to participate in someone's home performance unless he is already in Shanghai. (33)</p>
