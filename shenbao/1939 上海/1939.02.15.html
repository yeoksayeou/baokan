<p>社評</p>
<h3>英法如何答復日本</h3>
<p>日軍旣在中國海南島登陸，法英兩國駐東京大使，於前昨二日，相繼向日本外務大臣有田，提出質問，要求說明；事刋昨今報端。英法質問之內容，未經刋布，我人無自獲知其詳；但純就外交範圍內言之，所可根據之條的協定與聲明以及日本迭决所作諾言，不但資料豐富，抑且論據充盈，有非對方遁辭所得委蛇者；顧證之以日本政府所發外相有田答復英法兩大使之公報，似兩大使固亦未嘗就外交範圍據理力爭。意者，洞鑒於外交無靈，未欲辭費；僅以國際常例，姑且質問，但就外交範圍內之最低限度，聊盡人事而已。雖然，揆之常情恒理，迫使對方以不得不欺罔周旋，夫豈不如其已？然則何爲多此一舉？抑明知對方之必以欺罔周旋，旣不擬折之以正義嚴辭，而惟鞠躬以進之，囁嚅揖讓，唯唯諾諾，鞠躬而退，此非自暴爲闒茸，爲卑怯，又非自取其可欺可罔之辱歟？中國逢豪奪，英法逢巧取，所遭遇之方式不同；故中國迫而悲壯，英法相形可憫，顧皆當世最可同情之國家也。中國抗戰旣逾十八個月，安得英法朝野，瞿然於宰割之慘，行且及身，亟於外交範圍之外，奮發有爲耶！</p>
<p>英法繼質問之後者，將何所爲？謂外交無靈，安知不將謂外交之技未窮。是則不但此决有田答復之辭，爲稍歷世故所能逆覩，蓋虛僞欺妄至於斯極，初非意外；卽使再行抗議，亦必不出意料中之無結果。彼有田非謂日本對海南島無領土野心乎？夫何謂領土，東北乃中國之領土，而日本在中國束北之壓迫與榨取以及種種專制與運用，恣所欲爲，遠過於彼軍閥所得施之於彼三島之內者；日本固猶口口聲聲曰彼滿洲國也，日本無領土野心也；以彼例此，日本固不必日將攫海南島爲領土也。彼有田叉非謂佔領海南島之時期與性質，不超越軍事需要乎？夫日本封華作戰無關一島，顧猶藉口於軍事需要而圖佔領之；則以今日國際競擴軍備之無涯，豈有一日曰無需此島；以他日國際關係之愈趨尖銳，豈不可謂爲所謂「帝國生命綫」，所謂「東亞新秩序」，爲所謂「太平洋之太平」，故在軍事上更需此島。質問百决，抗議百决，將如此答復者二百决。推彼之意，將有一日焉，無須若此答復，即對華侵略成功矣，經營至於根深蒂固矣，四千萬方里之沃壤，四萬五千萬之華人，舉中國之資力物力人力，盡爲彼擴軍爭霸之用，無所忌憚於當世，歐美各國忍氣吞聲，以極自由之精神，極和平之方法，而自甘退出東亞矣；英法自將不復質問海南島矣！推彼之意，期不在遠；祗待全能國家羽毛稍豐之日，便是民治國家凌遲處死之時；安南，婆羅洲，緬甸，菲律賓，皆在釜爼，海南島其軔始而已。</p>
<p>抑有田答復之中，亦有値得注意之暗示焉。彼謂日軍在海南島登陸，將以「削弱蔣上將之抗戰力量而促之傾覆」，是又欺人之談，蓋削弱者，乃日本之分兵旁騖，而削弱其自身之侵略力量；顧可明白反證者，乃爲海南島之遭遇，非爾外交質問所可變更，而海南島之運命，實决於蔣委員長領導之抗戰。惟此暗示，英法而不安於日軍之將佔領海南島者，其惟有以最大之决心，最强之毅力，最敏捷之方法，對中國抗戰，盡所可能之極度而援助之。法國嘗虞日本佔領海南島以威脅安南，於是不顧中國根據中法滇越鐵道條的所應享運輸之權利，不顧國際聯盟儘量援助中國，毋使削弱中國抗戰力量之决議，不顧安南經濟上因此繁榮之機會，不顧滇越鐵道運輸所得之利潤，不顧中法最友善之睦誼，而接受日本所提不運中國軍火之要挾，曾幾何時，日本以事實答復法國日，日軍在海南島登陸矣。英國嘗以目前微利而阻止中國破壞漢口，與日妥協關稅問題；曾幾何時，日本以事實答復英國日，是皆吾所俘獲，爾不得染指也。夫在當時，乃至於現在，甚可原諒英法之委曲求全；今旣有種種事實說明委曲之無可求全，則除以有效行動答復日本之外，詎復有他道，抑詎復有他望！云何有效行動，不勝列舉；就事論事，先以滇越鐵道儘量予中國以運輸軍火之便利，以爲日軍悍然在海南島登陸之答復；更自他方力助抗戰，以爲日本昌言消減中國抗戰力量之答復；此其一二端而已。</p>
<h3>日軍侵佔海南島　係整個太平洋問題　民主國家對日惟有採取強硬行動　國際和平聯會華分會向國聯呼籲</h3>
<p>（重慶）國際和平聯合會中國分會、頃電國際聯盟會、揭發日軍此决在海南島登陸之野心、深盼英法美荷及九國公的簽字各國、予以注意、良以日軍此决在該島登陸之動機、完全欲於戰略上控制東京灣、包圍菲律濱、隔絕香港新加坡間之交通、以便一旦太平洋大戰發生時、日本可以應付英美兩國海軍之聯合行動、因此、日軍此番佔據海南島、不僅爲中日有關問題、實爲整個太平洋之問題、凡屬與太平洋利益有關之各國、均不容稍加忽視、假令日人在海南島方面獲得立足點、則國際形勢必將大變、該會同時又稱、各國若對此事仍採書面抗議、則絕無效力可言、蓋日人旣祇知武力爲有效之行動、故民主國家苟欲保全其威望及利益、亦惟有採取强硬之行動、以對付日本耳、（十三日美聯社電）　　（重慶）今晨中央日報刋有社論、對日本所稱進佔海南島、主要目的爲切斷華方經越南之軍器運輸、加以嘲笑、據稱、消息靈通方面、均熟知華方之軍器軍火、並非經越南或雷州半島而入內地者、日軍之侵佔海南島、純屬在太平洋西部擭得一重要之海軍與空軍根據地、以威脅瓜姆島與夏威夷島云大公報亦撰文論日軍佔該島事、謂法國因日本担保决不佔海南島、故迄未准許華方軍器運經越南、但法國雖忠實履行協定、然日本今竟在海南島登陸矣、法國今當知恐懼與妥協、僅能鼓勵侵略國、而對付武力之唯一有效方法、厥唯武力耳、法國今應准許中國之軍器經過越南矣云、（十四日路透電）　　（倫敦）中國蔣介石將軍稱、日本佔領海南島爲中日戰事發生後之最重要事件、其結果將威脅新加坡與澳洲間之交通、菲列濱及安南之安全、及英美在太平洋中之聯合行動云、（十四日快訊社電）</p>
<h3>各民治國家不應置太平洋風波於不顧</h3>
<p>（倫敦）日軍在海南島登陸事、頃由此間各報賡續加以評論、「每日電郵報」載稱、「就英法兩國觀之、日軍此舉、確爲外務部决官白特勒前於去歲六月間在下議院所謂「足以引起不愉快的糾紛」、其可能之惡影饗、白特勒次官言之尚屬過輕耳、溯此事發生以還、中國蔣介石上將所發表之覜感、與義國當局授意該國報紙所發表之評論、雖大相逕庭、但均認爲此舉、已在太平洋方面造成一種新局勢、而以嚴重威脅加諸各民治國所保有之利益、此則並無二致、抑尤有進者、法國原已在地中海方面感受壓力、茲又在遠東方面遭遇橫逆、章者反共產國際公的各簽字國、早有默契、茲乃互相呼應歟、情勢若斯、各民治國豈宜全神貫注於西方、而置太平洋方面之風波於不問不聞、卽就美國言之、彼所感受之影響、實不亞於歐洲各友邦、是亦彰彰明甚、至於英國、吾人現有兩大自治領（係指加拿大與澳洲聯邦而言）與許多屬地、胥賴太平洋交通綫為命脈、此與英倫三島端賴北海地中海紅海之航運以維護其生存、初無二致」云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>馬尼刺　據新加坡方面傳來之消息稱、日本佔領海南島之動機、純在將該島作强有力之潛艇根據地、該島地位適中、在戰略上可以西擊新加坡與安南、東擊菲列賓、商業上可以控制歐美各國對遠東之商道、總之、日本佔據此島、已予菲列賓之獨立希望以重大之打擊、同時香港之戰略地位亦因是而消失、法國在安南方面、雖努力於軍港之建築、亦已遭受嚴重之威脅、今日菲島消息報評蔣委員長關於日軍在該島登陸之見解稱、蔣委員長之言、雖在引起英美法各國之注意、促共對日予以制裁、但蔣氏所言、亦屬十分眞確之事實、故凡與太平洋有關之各國、確應予以十二分之注意、該報又謂、美國對日之見解、已有甚大之轉變、日軍此决佔據海南島、必將加速美國此種見解之轉變、按美國一搬人民自中日戰事爆發以來、對於遠東事件、始終不願多所干涉、幸賴羅斯福總統不絕設法引起其注意、故美國民衆對於遠東、亦逐漸增加其關心之程度、此乃極可引以爲慰者、（十四日美聯電）　　（倫敦）日軍在海南島登陸事、頃由的克厦郵報（夙以前外相艾登機關報見稱）加以評論云、日軍突然出此舉動、察其意義殆有數端、共直接之影響、乃在威魯英法兩國之利益、而此事之發生、又與歐洲局勢之緊張周時開展、是尤足證明其反共產國際公約其他兩簽字國敲詐計劃、實相呼應、關於反共公的改訂爲軍事同盟公的之議、日來已由德義日三國當局進行討論、美國方面軍空軍根據地之計劃、如是觀察、亦自不謂無因、此外日本獲有歐洲各全能國之鼓勵、因利乘便、竟對於美國在太平洋方面所保有之利益加以威脅、是則足使美國輿情、對於歐洲各全能國、愈見其深惡痛絕者云、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>海南島與法國在遠東利益</h3>
<p>— 布三譯</p>
<p>（譯自上海出版的「中國國民難誌」第一〇八期田伯烈原著）（二）</p>
<p>從一九三二年起，法國對於遠東的態度已有了改變。以前，法國對於中國國民政府所提出的撤消領事裁判權，以及外僑所享有的特殊權益，曾極力反對，而對於共產主義在中國的發展也表示憂慮。這時日本乃以防備「赤禍」與外僑利益保護者自居。法國所以改變其對中國國民政府所取的態度者，是出於國民政府反對共產主義所致。再者日本之向中國進攻，不但法國在中國所得的權益將感受威脅，而且法國在遠東的領土也要覺得可危，這是法國不能忘懷的。</p>
<p>法國在遠東最大的領土當然要算安南，這是不成問題的。安南與北非是法國兩個最重要的殖民地，第一是因爲安南人民衆多，物產豐富，是法國原料第三大供給地；其次因爲安南是法國廣大的投資地與物品的市塲。</p>
<p>若從軍略的觀點而論，安南之於法國更有生死的重要性，其理由不外下列幾點：（一）中國與安南交界，約有一千六百公里的共同界錢，故法國不能不直接注意中國的事變。（二）西貢是法國與遠東間航行的重要停泊港。（三）河內成爲中法商業航空的終點。（四）法國計劃將康蘭灣（Baic　de　Camranh）築成法國在遠東的海軍根據地。道是一個天然的港口，如同美國的舊金山一樣·一九〇五年日俄戰爭時，俄國一百四十五艘兵艦所組成的遠征艦隊曾集中於這個海濤中。該灣位於香港與新加坡的中途，離馬尼刺與東印度各一千二百公里。（五）安南是法國通入中國的陸路之一，其孔道即是雲南，故其重要性已一天高一天。</p>
<p>最近幾個月來的事實已使安南的地位特別提高。安南與香港免不了要成爲軍火運入中國的唯一要道，不過凡是由安南運入雲南的軍火，必須先得到法國外交部與殖民部的許可才可通行。雖然法國政府尚未正式宣布禁運軍火予中國，但去年十月會决定只有在中日戰事未發生以前所定購的，或一九三七年十月十二日以前所裝載的軍火才能由安南運入雲南。雖然如此，日本還責備法國將軍火源源運入中國，中國也責備法國不當阻礙軍火自由運入中國，這好像是法國間接援助日本的行爲。關於這個問題，似乎只有法國外交部才能明瞭眞相，外界不得而知。</p>
<p>法國在中國南部還保有與統制一個廣州灣租借地，該地面積有八百平方公里，人口有二十五萬人。該地由法國於一八九八年租得，與英國租得威海衛同時，德國也在這年租得膠州灣。廣州灣與海南島相瞞很近，但若海南島一朝被日本佔領，則廣州灣就减少它軍略上的重耍性，這種事實大有發生的可能性。外來貨物雖然可以從廣州灣運入內地，但該地商業往來並不十分重要。</p>
<p>在法國遠東的勢力圈內有兩個特別重要的地帶，就是西沙羣島與海南島。西沙羣島是一羣小島，位於安南之東與海南島之西南。法國說根據歷史記載，西沙羣島久被安南政府佔領，故當歸屬法國，這當然是中國所吾認的。最近日本又說一九二〇年以來，日本人會不斷的在該羣島開採燐石，故當歸屬日本。正在雙方爭論中，法國就派軍隊登陸將該羣島予以佔領。表面上的理由是保護法國的產業，實際上是阻止日本軍隊登岸，並阻止日本人利用該羣島加緊封鎖中國海岸。雖然該羣島在海軍根據地方面的價値大有爭論之處，但在軍略上對於安南是十分重要的。因爲倘若該羣島一旦被法國的敵國佔領，則安南就大受威脅。據海軍專家估計，只要在該羣島駐紮一隊潛水艇，就可以將安南各港口與外界的定期交通切斷。關於西沙羣島在經濟方面的價値，論者意見並不一致。據聞該羣島藏有足供安南取用二十年的燐酸鹽。</p>
<p>海南島的重要性比之西沙羣島更要大得多。該島位於安南之東，其地位足以直接控制東京　，在軍略上是有生死的重要性。所以有人責備法國未將該島與安南愿時佔領，這是法國的錯誤。在一八丸八年中法條的中，中國承諾如未得到法國的同意，决不將海南島割讓與任何第三國。</p>
<p>在目前情形之下，如果日本耍佔領海南島，則中國就很難阻止。法國如未得到外援，也不能單獨阻止日本佔據該島。該島位於香港與新加坡兩海軍根據地的中途，故英國也非常關心該島的命運。因此，法國爲海南島問題需要外援時，則此種外援大概是來自英國。不論何國，如果在海南島安置潛水艇與水上飛機，就可以威脅香港與新加坡交通的安全。</p>
<p>海南島對於日本的重要性，不但由於該島可以做日本進攻華南各省的根據地，而且由於該島可以做日本商輪往來的樞紐：例如航行澳大利亞，南海，印度與歐洲的日本商輪都要經過該島。關於這個間題，有一位日本作家曾說過，日本佔領海南島，一方面可以切斷香港與新加坡的聯絡，以削减英國在遠東的勢力；另一方面日本可以藉此開闢一條南進的新路。</p>
<p>自從中國一感覺到海南島在軍略上的重要性之後，最近幾年來就在該島大加開發天然的富源，例如種植橡樹，咖啡，棉花，余鷄納霜，烟草，以及其他熱帶草木。在一九三七年初期，政府機關代表與金融界或商界代表曾佔計該島富源，與研究商業的可能性並推廣種植，修築鐵路等。本來鐵路已開工修築，不幸中日戰事發生後，乃於一九三七年八月停止。</p>
<p>由上看來，中日英法四國都非常注意這個海南島，將來該島一定耍成為威脅太平洋的火藥庫，這是自然的道理。一九三八年六月中旬以日本外相鄭重聲明日本毫無佔領海南島意思；但三日以後，外務省發言人又聲稱：「倘若在打倒國民政府的門爭中，有必耍時，日本可以佔領海有島。」再往後一點，日本宣告「海南島中國駐軍威脅日本在華南沿海作戰的軍艦，」海南島便大遭日本飛機與軍艦的轟炸。結果英法兩國便共同向日本提出照會，勸日本勿侵佔海南島，倘若事態嚴重，則英法兩國對日將採取共同行動。英法這種宣言可以使人相信英法大有在太平洋簽訂海軍協定的可能。在這種種的背後，英法在政治上可謂已經合作了，一方面是因爲遠東問題，一方面是因爲反共集團的形成。日本爲着防共公的的關係，對於歐洲局勢也不得不加以注意。</p>
<p>無論在太平洋，或在地中海與中歐，英法兩國的利益都是相同的。法國自當保誕它在遠東的領土，如同英國一樣，所不同的，不過是法國的海軍力不足以完成這個目的。不論在安南沿岸或在中國領海中，法國的艦隊都是很分散的，而且力量上也比較薄弱。可是法國在安南擁有大批的殖民地軍隊，並且軍事設備也很完備，如果日本進攻安南，法國尚可與之一抗，但結果屬於悲觀的方面佔多數。</p>
<p>法國眼光遠大的人士非常恐懼日本要依照它的擴展政策向安南進攻，允其是日本人所提出「亞洲人的亞洲」的理論進展得很决。日本前內相米內與其他官員都曾宣傳將有色人種從白種人手中解放出來，這種宣傳曾在法國引起很大的隱憂，允其是因爲日本在暹雜發展勢力。最近日本報紙曾對法國大施攻擊，這也可促令法國與英國合作，以挽救它們在遠東的利益。（完）</p>

<h3>一年來的　浦東游擊隊（續完）英</h3>
<p>現在浦東各縣的行政，均一切照常，由江蘇省政府委任各縣縣長，辦理一切事宜。政訓工作則各個游擊隊皆設有政訓處及宣傳組，更於某地設立抗建公學一所，藉以培養各級幹部人才。關於軍餉的供給，因一時尚不能得到政府的供給，故由各縣縣政府開征田賦貨物各稅，以資維持。但只要是眞正爲民抗日的隊伍，民衆寗可自己不食而送給隊伍作軍糧的。有一次，浦東的某鎭，當日兵撤退，游擊隊進駐時，民衆自動的高懸靑白旗，俟隊伍通過街市時，更燃放爆竹，報以熱烈鼓掌，這不是人民眞情的流露嗎？總之，浦東的民衆，民族意識已大大的增强了，只要是爲國效命的部隊，他們是絕對歡迎的。</p>
<p>（三）在這一年中做了些什麽</p>
<p>工作</p>
<p>在這裏，當然不能把各個游擊隊所履行的大小工作都叙述出來，只是扼要的略記於下</p>
<p>一·在一年中所經過的幾决重要的戰鬥——浦東游擊隊雖然只是一個初生的嬰兒，但他和敵人經過的戰鬥也有數百决之多。比較重要的有：甲·前歲歲末，游擊隊李伯全部百餘人，於南橋司令部爲敵軍所包圍，肉搏多時，幾全部殉難，逃出者僅數人，這是涌東游擊隊和敵初决的交鋒；乙·去年初春，日軍大隊來犯，與李志蝗部戰於奉賢縣的青村港，互有傷亡，而敵軍後竟將該鎭全部焚燬，一片焦土；丙·去歲四月中旬，于陶生的各部隊員潛入敵軍佔領之新塲鎮，殺死敵軍二名，我無損傷；丁·七月初，丁錫山部與敵海軍陸戰隊戰於閘港，敵艦發砲助戰，後不支退去；戊·去年當八一三一週紀念時，全浦東游擊隊發動全面反攻，于陶生部攻上川路；李志明部協同丁錫山的范部攻上南路；丁錫三部攻滬杭公路。此役戰鬥之劇烈，爲歷來所未有允以于陶生部之攻上川路爲最。敵軍於上川路終點之祝橋鎭本築有堅强工事，且事前有充分準備，而于部以低劣之武器，血肉之軀，與之博鬥，激戰達數晝夜，變游擊戰爲陣地戰，而敵之後路已遭我破壞，猶拚死抵抗，終因其砲火猛烈，故我方犧牲重大，素爲民衆所敬愛的于部薛大隊附永昌及其手下之區隊長，機關槍正副班長，皆在此役中殉難。其戰鬥之忠勇，實驚天地而泣鬼神，結果，祝橋鎭終爲我克服，奪獲敵軍馬匹彈藥甚多。這决戰爭爲浦東歷决最劇烈者；己·去歲雙十節，我忠勇的浦東游擊隊再度作全面反攻，于陶生部又克復祝橋鎭，　一直追踪敵軍至川沙縣城；丁部破壞上南路後，複與各地日軍起激戰，三林塘鎭被據去僞警等有一二十名，追敵軍至沿黃浦江之周家渡鎭，日軍無法再逃，乃全都向丁部士兵跪而求命，可笑之至，後被丁部全部解决。自此役後，日軍對於浦東游擊隊已不敢輕視，時刻留心防守二鐵路，幾有草木皆兵之概。庚·去年年底，敵集合上海附近全部日軍，的共萬餘名，由海陸空聯合作大規模的進攻，游擊隊進退得宜，分頭迎戰，有名之周秋萍（即周大根）烈士即殉難於泥城之役，此决敵軍用僞軍徐鴻發作前導，更軍火充足，故處佔便　宜。此役游擊隊死傷共有數百人之衆，而敵僞軍亦死傷四五百名。此外，各部隊之與敵博鬥，不知凡幾，不能詳細錄下。現在的游擊隊正在日日訓練中，預備在一個相當期間，把全痛東的敵人消滅。</p>
<p>二·爲民衆消除了大漢奸——漢奸的罪惡，比敵人還厲害，游擊隊早已恨之切骨了。在去年的四月初，丁錫三部冒了極大的險，衝入楊思橋鎭，一面包圍日軍司令部；一面槍殺漢奸張尚義並燒毀了他的住宅，後因日軍大隊趕到，故郎全部引退。去秋，丁錫山范部叉用計槍斃漢奸李天民於魯家滙；于部斬决僞南滙縣長蔡頌堯；以上爲其犖犖大者。自此後一般漢奸再不敢作惡如往昔。</p>
<p>三·廣設學校，救濟失學兒童——各部隊鑒於日軍實施奴化教育，於國家前途爲害匪淺，於是在各處設立學校，免費教導兒童，灌輸抗日思想，每日舉行升旗典禮及政治講話，故浦東一般民衆愛國情緒，極爲高漲。　　（四）給予我們的教訓</p>
<p>浦東游擊隊雖然成立只一年，但是已給了我們不少的敎訓：</p>
<p>第一·告訴了我們：軍民應該相互帮助，共同合作，絕對不能分開的·浦東游擊隊在過去一年中幾决戰鬥的失敗，都是由於軍民不能互相了解，不能打成一片。所以以後更應致力於軍民合作，才能收更大的成效。</p>
<p>第二·告訴了我們：游擊戰在今後的抗戰地位中將佔更重要的位置，絕不能抹煞了他的作用。例如浦東游擊隊雖然現在不能完全把敵人驅逐出境，但至少已牽制了敵人的兵力，現在浦東的敵軍已不敢輕易調動了，這也不是對於持久戰上一種帮助嗎？今後更應加以嚴格的訓練，予敵人以更大的打擊。</p>
<p>第三·告訴了我們：各個隊伍間應真正的精誠合作，才能勝利。過去有一個時間，浦東游擊隊常互相妒忌，以致起衝突，實際上却有利於敵人來各個擊破。現在雖然已較前進步多多，但還未到團結的最高峯。須知道，有計劃的合作呼應，配合戰爭，才能有大的效果。</p>
<p>第四·告訴了我們：在軍隊中政治工作的重要。最低限度，游擊隊員須明暸我們爲什麼要抗戰，爲了誰抗戰，然後才能勇於作戰。浦東游擊隊無疑的，政治工作做得很覺不够，所以時有擾民火併的舉動，今後，在這一點須特別注意。</p>
<p>末了，我們謹向爲國家生存而戰的浦東游擊隊遙致民族解放的最敬禮！希望他們不斷地改進，增强實力，而成爲將來克復大上海的先頭部隊！</p>

<p>上海敎育界改革敎育意見</p>
<h3>當前靈改進我國高等敎育垢意見書　（一）</h3>
<p>— 蔭樓</p>
<p>高等敎育之目的何在、高等敎育之目的、一在陶冶學生之品德、使成爲完善之人、一在訓練學生專門技術、使成爲有用之才、要達到此兩大目的、當然不是一朝一夕的事、所謂敎育乃百年大計、辦理高等敎育者、固應放大目光、高瞻遠矚、堅持着此兩大目標向前邁進、不應因環境的轉移、而有所變更、不過時代今昔不同、社會瞬息千變、所謂完人的品德、因道德觀念的變遷而有出入、所謂有用的人才也因社會的需要而有變動、所以高等敎育目的雖可不變、欲達此目的的方法、則不能不適應時代與社會、在平安時期用平安時期的敎育方法、在非常時期用非常時期的敎育方法、在革命時期用革命時期的敎育方法、因時制宜、法制典章應如此、高等敎育也何常不應如此、蓋敎育而超越時代、這是忘本、敎育而跟不上時代、這是落伍、忘本落伍、都不是一國敎育的正態、中國高等敎育自發創（自開創廣方言館起）到現在、已有七十多年、此七十多年中、中間經過許多次的改革、前半期的高等敎育是以師儒訓導作經典考據、墨守舊法、一切惟我獨尊、這可以說是落伍的高等敎育、後半期的高等敎育、前二十年是大都模仿日本、近十年來有一個時期完全模仿歐洲、有一個時期完全模仿美國、不顧本國的國情、而專去模仿人家、這可以說是忘本的高等敎育、因爲過去的落伍與忘本、所以中國的敎育是表現着很多的病態、值此國家多難的非常時期、我們豈可再坐視這病態的繼續與延長、今敎育行政當局、於此軍事倥惚之時、在重慶召集第三次全國敎育會議、其目的固在糾正過去的病態、與應付當前的局勢、意義自屬非常重大、鄙人忝爲敎育界的一分子、自當竭其愚誠、就高等敎育一問題略抒管見、以就正於參加會議諸公之前、</p>
<p>（一）課程應切於實用</p>
<p>現在國內專科以上學校之課程、類過偏於學理的研究、而忽視着實習的經騐、當然我們也承認學理於科學上的貢獻、關係很大、不過重理論而輕實習、這是紙上談兵、失去了科學的目標、我常常看到很多的大學敎授、有的畜牧濱理論研究得委高深、而養不大一隻猪、有的園藝學的理論研究得很高深、而種不活一棵花、有的電機學的理論研究得很高深、而不能修理一具普通的電扇、有的學法律的理論研究得很高深、而不能撰一張普通的辯訴狀、諸如此類的大學生大學敎授、在國內已是司空見慣、他們認爲學理是一件事、事實是一件事、好像是不相爲謀的、所以學工業的忽視了工塲的實習、學畜牧的忽視了農塲的實習、學商業的忽視了商業機關的實習、其他像物理化學醫學法律無論自然科學社會科學、都是這樣的拿理論看得很重、拿實際看的很輕、在校時不能學其所用、將來將何以用其所學、尤其在這非常時期危急存亡之秋、科學的實用比理論的空談要迫切得多、所以我主張現在大學校的各種專門學科、應當極力提倡實習的經騐、最好能與工廠事務所機關等等通力合作打成一片、以學理爲工廠等機關研究的工作、以實習爲工廠等機關實行的工作、在做中學、在學中做、這樣的研究才是眞眞的研究、這樣的實習才是眞眞的實習、</p>
<p>（二）科目與敎材應適合學生程度</p>
<p>關於課程方面再有一點可以注意的、便是現在國內大中學學程每喜以門類多用書深爲標榜、我們試取國內任何大學的章程以讀之、覺其所設科目、平均每系在三四十門以上、若查考其所用之書籍、則中學用外國大學的書、大學用外國研究院的書、且用外國語言講解的亦不少、一若非此不足以表現其程度的高深、夫大中學程度的提高、誰也不會反對、學校課目的門類多用書深、我也可表贊同、衹要大多數學生的精力時間是够得上、衹要大多數學生能了解、衹要學校有相當的敎授來指導、又衹要學校有相當的設備和參考書、假使大多數學生衹能讀六種科目、你勉强他讀七種八種、大多數的學生衹有中學生程度、你勉强他讀大學的書本、便是學校方面有相當的敎授和設備、我恐怕眞能融會貫通的不過寥寥幾位傑出的學生、而此輩傑出的學生、又每因功課繁重、用功過度而夭壽、（此種事實、以中學學生爲尤多、）其於國家社會的損失實大、至於大部分的學生、則囫圇吞棗、食而不化、其因一種二種學課的基礎沒有打好、致動搖其整個研究學問的興趣與前程屬實不少、所以大中學科目雖多用書雖深、結果是非徒無益而且有害、最近敎育部釐訂大學各學院的標準課程、固可以防止各大學課程之濫設、惟於大學用書和敎材方面、還沒有統一的具體辦法、就我個人的見解、則大學用書應斟酌大學學生程度由各敎授自編講義學程網要、其不得已而用外國原本者、除外國語一課外、應一體用中文講解、而同時並望敎育部於各學課指定相當的參考書、限令各學校圖書館至少選購五種或六種、復限定陋二年增加其一部分、强制學生作課外的研究、一方面再督促國立編譯館積極翻譯各種外國科學書籍、使科學名詞逐漸標準化、此亦爲整理大學敎材最重要的工作、若就現在的方法、由各敎授於上課時取外國研究院所讀的書本而解釋之或取自己所編成的講義而讀之、不再指定其課外的研究工作者、當然不能認爲良好的敎授方法、</p>
<p>（三）學生生活的改善</p>
<p>敎育應當適應社會的環境、我在上面已經略加申說、我們看到現在四萬萬五千萬的同胞中、有飯吃的佔多少、足衣足食的占多少、近年來內憂外患、天災人禍、交相煎逼、全國大多數的民眾都在死裏求生中掙扎、度着那非人的生活、然而我們想到中國過去多數的大學生生活、（現在恐猶不少）幾無處不求其高貴舒適、奢靡放浪、大學校的建築和設備、幾無處不求其富麗摩登、重形式而不重精神、這是拿富貴的敎育來敎育貧苦的子弟、拿歌舞昇平的敎育來行使到千瘡百孔的國家、爲中國造成士大夫式的特殊階級、所謂敎育適應社會者安在、沒有堅苦卓絕的精神、那裏談得到「以儉養廉」、「臥薪嘗膽」、「救國雪恥」、我們看到丹麥日本蘇俄等國的大學生、其服裝以簡陋爲榮、其生活以奢靡爲恥、甚至有很多學校的校舍是學生自己建築的、有很多女學校的膳食是學生輪值煮燒的、更看到德國的學校有所謂靑年營下鄉年勞工營等活動、强制學生於學校畢業前參加靑年營或下鄉年以服役勞務、於學校畢業後參加勞工營以從事勞動、其下鄉年和勞工營等的工作證明書、於公務員的任用資格上、與畢業證明書可說有同一的重要性、這是要磨練學生有一種刻苦耐勞的精神、化除學生公子少爺的習氣、使其認識民間的疾苦、能進而爲民眾服務、換句話說、是要使學生的生活簡單化勞動化和紀律化、這實在是最有意義的辦法、我中國敎育值此非常時期、更應避免過去重視物質的外觀、而忽視精神的磨鍊、積極提倡類似勞工營及下鄉年等組織、於大中學中分別推行、一方鍛鍊學生使有堅苦卓絕的精神、一方利用此時機、使學生了解民眾、組織民眾、爲民眾服務、以奠定復興中華民族的基礎、　（未完）</p>

<h3>銀錢業籃球隊賽</h3>
<p>本市銀錢業聯誼會舉辧之籃球聯賽、春節仍舉行二十一日下午四時三十分、該會代表隊銀錢聯與碰壁隊將在弘毅中學球塲舉行表演賽銀聯隊中、擁有賈幼良莊友仁等健將、而碰壁隊又復馳譽球界、屆時角逐定必熱烈、</p>
<p>十二日比賽結果　金城勝鹽業、五三——二二、蘇農勝中孚、六三——一〇、中行勝北美洲、七六——六、上海勝銀聯、四六——一八、寗聯勝國華、二八——一四</p>
<h3>今年台維斯杯　美國仍有保持希望　靑年後備軍充足　列格斯取代勃琪</h3>
<p>一九三九年的各大網球比賽、現在已經定了、惠勃爾登將於六月二十六日起始、比去年提早了六天、但仍和一貫的「六月的第三個星期一」起始的慣例沒有改變、法國錦標賽、將在六月八日在巴黎舉行、德國錦標則在七月十四日漢堡開幕、美國錦標賽則在九月七日仍在林山比賽、台維斯杯的第一週、將在五月初就開始、而最後一週在美國費城結束、却令治週去年本在德人城的木球會、但這許多名將决戰的戰塲、似乎有點不能合乎需要、所以美國台杯委員會、已决定向費城木球會商借塲地、</p>
<p>美國　美國現在雖然已經失去了他的台柱勃琪、但是他們的後備軍却是充足得很、加利福尼亞省就是最充足的一角、所以我們絕不能急遽的就預言今年美國要「歡送」台盃出境、去年中、澳洲曾爬到台盃左近、若不是靑年的列格斯擊敗了奎斯脫、澳洲早就把這大銀盃裝箱運回澳洲了、當然、美國立時找不出一個恰當的勃琪代替者、來保衛這台盃、但她却有許多有用的材料、以爲製造勃琪的代表的原料、例如、列格斯、鐵博爾（他還未被列格斯打敗過）麥谷、（在美國錦標中唯一能從勃琪手中奪過一盤的人）等、此外如前美國台杯代表之伍特、施爾斯等、他們兩人都還衹二十七歲、與鐵爾頓第一次贏得惠勃爾登錦標時一般大、</p>
<p>義捷　義大利今年也加入比賽、在歐洲、意大利的墨索里尼運動塲、是現在歐洲最堂皇的一個運動塲、他們的名手斯得芬尼最近曾在倫敦療治其受傷之脚部、不久即可再上球塲、巴洛尼、羅曼諾尼、及加那比等人、都已有相當的進步、而巴米利則已加入職業界、捷克失去了好幾個名手、實力大槪不能和去年的相比擬了、丹麥今年有一個很好的選手傑可勃遜、他今年在瑞典國王杯比賽時、曾把法國最强的鮑羅脫拉和蒲塞斯都打敗了、</p>
<p>英國　英國的台杯選手隊、大槪不久就能產生了、他們新的和舊的好材料倒有不少、在去年中、如果以奧斯丁和李氏來打單打、用許士和比靈頓來打雙打、那歐洲帶冠軍大槪德國就奪不着了、如果今年這隊能出席、那歐洲帶的冠軍還有希望、可是他們的事業和他們的年齡、將要把這美夢打破、所以實際上說、須要另找一隊、加以訓練才成、伯特勒、施愛斯　非爾比等、在菲洲比賽回來時、經騐又多了不少、球藝也相當有進步、莊士今年的結果很不差、他和海爾不久也要到西印度去比賽、而王爾得與比靈頓下月中也要到挪威瑞典去比賽了、</p>

<p>科學與人生</p>
<h3>科學與藝術</h3>
<p>— 曹友信</p>
<p>使平民能享受貴族式的藝術是科學對於藝術的第一大功。在照相發明以前，世界上的名畫都只有少數的人有機會能看見。如果你喜歡買一幅則非很高的代價不行，眞不是常人所能染指的。有時還有錢買不到哩。自照相術發明之後，你可以化幾角錢買一幅名貴來掛掛，維妙維肖，絲毫不爽。有些人說照相沒有原來的好。這是心理作用，照相已和原畫完全一樣，何分好壞。若說因原畫價貴，心理上就覺得他好，那末鈔票就是世界上最美麗的東西了。當然現在的彩色印刷還未到盡善盡美的地步，但在普通人目光中，現在彩印的畫和原畫已經是很難分出高下了。</p>
<p>對於音樂，科學也有很大的貢獻。留聲片把有名的演奏保留起來。買一個片子的價錢還不到聽一次名家演奏的門票。無綫電更使音樂普遍化了。一個人在電臺上演奏，同時可以有幾百萬人收聽。曾經有人批評，說聽留聲片譬如吃罐頭食物，至於無綫電，則味道全變了。若不是這人沒有見過好的留聲機和無綫電，那末他一定是吹毛求疵。普通好的無綫電收音機所得的音質變態在百分之五左右。這種微小的變態就是音樂家也聽不出來。總之反對這種進步的不是落伍者，就是自私的資產者。最近英國名科學家祁恩司（James　Jeans）說：『人們以爲鋼琴家能用各種方法彈一個音鍵，以表達出他心中的情感，這句話可說是全無意義』。他又說：『美國的科學家曾經將有名的鋼琴家彈琴時的音波拍了照相，後來用各種輕重不同的東西落到鍵上，發見某一重量的落下所發的音完全和鋼琴家的音波形狀一樣。所以只要彈鍵輕重適宜，用手指彈的和用洋傘柄打的完全一樣。手指擊鍵的姿勢當然是無關係的。…………』從這一點看來，科學家已經替鋼琴家解决了最大的手指問題了。藝術家當然不相信這個。可是我可以預言將來總有一天一個機器人能够彈得和鋼琴家一樣好。還有自從照相術發明之後，藝術又多了一種攝影藝術。這可以說是科學替藝術開闢了新園地。電影的發明使演戲藝術更進步更逼眞，而民衆也能更普遍的享受。所以科學是促進藝術和民衆的接觸，因之使藝術更進步更完美了。</p>
<h3>紫外綫和紅外綫的應用</h3>
<p>— 旦</p>
<p>誰都知道太陽會放出光和熱來。我們能看見光，我們能感覺熱。普通的日光雖是白色的，但是却是由各種有色光——即不同波長的以太振動！</p>
<p>所組合而成。假使我們把一縷光綫通過一塊三稜鏡，牠就被分成了紅橙黃綠靑藍紫這些光，依次排列。可是紅以外和紫以外還有光，不過或因以太的波太長或太短，不爲肉眼所見罷了。</p>
<p>研究可見的光雖覺很有趣，可是在過去半個世紀中，科學家却又注意到不可見的光上去了。醫生們發見，在海濱或鄕村裏過了暑假回來的人，總覺得舒適和快樂，就是因爲被日光多晒的緣故。在城市裏，那充滿了煤氣的空氣，把許多有益人體的光綫，在未達到我們的皮膚之前吸收了。這有益人體的光綫之一，就是不可見的紫外錢，所以如此稱牠，是因爲牠的波長，剛比可見的紫光爲短。爲了住在潮濕的天氣裏，或住在最骯髒的城市裏的人們，得不到充份的陽光，科學家已發明了人工製造日光的方法。他們用一只長形的石英管，在管的一端貯水銀，把電流通過水銀的蒸汽時，管內即發出富有紫外綫的射綫。另有一種太陽燈，好像弧光燈一般，祗是用　代替了炭捧。平常的炭若經特別鍊製之後，也能發生紫外綫。這幾種燈眞是多麽驚人的發明，現在每一個醫院裹都少不了用牠來治療病人。</p>
<p>紫外綫的特性之一，就是牠易被障礙物所吸收，人身上的衣服，甚至皮膚上的油脂，都能吸收紫外綫，而使它不能達到皮膚，所以受太陽燈治療的病人，都需先洗個澡。平常含鉛的玻璃能使普通的光透過，但是會吸收紫外綫，所以太陽燈要用「石英玻璃」來做。</p>
<p>紫外綫有很多有趣的性質。牠雖對於我們的肉眼是不可見的，但是容易使照相底片感光。因此浴於純粹紫外綫中的物體雖是不可見，我們却能用照相機來拍出它的照片。若用紫外綫代替了平常的光，透鏡的放大率可以大爲增加。有許多細菌實在太小，用尋常的顯微鏡仍舊不能看出，所以科學家特發明了一種用紫外綫的顯微鏡。當然，一個普通人在紫外綫下不會看得見什麽，可是一個專家能從顯微鏡下攝得細菌的照片，這些細菌眞是小得連磁器也穿得過呢。這種發明的最大成功，就是足部和口腔病細菌的發見。</p>
<p>家用健康射錢燈。紫外綫或紅內錢都可照射。紫外綫使你皮膚曬黑，增加活力。紅外綫可治療風濕病，神經炎，皮膚發疹，坐骨神經痛等病症。</p>
<p>紫外綫在工業上也有很大的用途。我們能用牠來辨別在日光下不能辨別的顏色，也能用牠來辨別　造物。牠能使織布廠每年節省大量金錢。織布的材料，往往因細菌和發霉，而致損傷，直耍到完全織成時，才能看出，此種布匹，均在摒棄之列。所以現在歐美大規模的織造工廠裏，凡遇可疑的村料，都須在紫外綫室內檢騐過，以求事前的袖救。</p>
<p>還有一種不可見的光呌做紅外綫，因爲牠的波長適比可見的紅光爲長。紅外綫　是不可見，但是氣體所生的火焰，都能放出這種光來。又有一種特別製成的黏土燈絲，能放出很多的紅外綫。浴於這種光綫中的人，總覺得很舒適，尤其是在冬天，但是牠的作用，要比紫外綫溫和些。</p>
<p>紅外綫可供醫學上治療之用。紅外綫燈，並不發出可見的光綫，因此常附裝一只小的紅燈泡，以示這燈是否在工作。用紅外綫治療總在暗室中行之，以免受可見光綫的妨礙。這種和暖而有透射性的紅外綫，常使生肌肉病的人感到舒適，而在某種外科術上，這種光綫也常用來代替刀割。</p>
<p>太陽放出大量的紅外綫來使我們覺得和暖。它像紫外綫一樣，也能使照相底片感光，科學家常利用了這種光綫，把不能目睹的東西，攝成照片。例如高山常被雲霧所遮蔽，但若用一種特別的照相機，把大部分的平常光綫隔去，而祇讓紅外綫通過，於是隱藏着的高峯和山谷，都能淸晰地顯出在照片上。這種照相機中所用的透鏡。都用岩鹽製的反射鏡來代替，因爲玻璃要吸收紅外綫。照最近的發明，並且可以利用紅外綫，以照相的方法，來險騐機器的過熱部分。</p>
<p>一次紫外綫的日光浴，能使她感到精神飽滿，健康快樂，不易受感冒。</p>
<h3>熱射線燈</h3>
<p>— 尚玉</p>
<p>美國奇異電器公司，爲醫治各種根深的充血症起見，發明了一種一〇瓦特的熱燈，非常有効而便利。此燈所用的燈泡，係由只能透過紅外綫的黑玻璃製成，有一個反射鏡，能把紅外綫直接集中於患處。這種射綫有貫穿力，能增加正常血液的作用，故可醫治充血症。</p>
<p>此燈使用簡單而安全，用輕質的鋁製成，外塗象牙色的琺瑯，有一個便利的電鍵和永久連接着的全橡皮包的線繩。所用的電力爲一〇瓦特，電壓爲一一〇伏特，交流電或直流電都可用。因爲輕便，故可携就急要醫治充血症的旅客。附圖爲用新式輕便的熱燈局部地醫治充血症。</p>
<h3>怪餐館</h3>
<p>— 心織</p>
<p>有一次基本甲在美國一個熱鬧的城市裏，賃了一所房子，裝修起來，開設了餐館。開張之後，果然生意興隆。不過隔了不久，這所房子出了怪異，餐館主人倒起霉來了。僱用的堂倌侍役都做了三日京兆，不願意做這種生意，客人來光顧的也一天少似一天了。都因爲怕遇着怪事的緣故。什麽怪事呢？店裏的銀器或是鈹銀的刀叉會自己變黑。鋼鐵的器具和鐵鍋都會自己移動。客人身上的錶會忽然的停止。有人就告訴店主說：這所房子的貼鄰是當地電廠的一個分站，四周的人家都靠這分站供給電流。恐怕是電流走到隔壁來作怪吧。店主果然就寫信給電廠經理，說是他們所發的電，妨碍他的營業，請他們設法改良，不要隨便放電流出來闖禍。電廠經理接到了信，就招了電機工程師來商量，說『這個人恐怕是有神經病，但是我們不妨調查一下，看這人所說的話到底是不是事實。可是决不要使他知道我們疑心着他有神經病』。調查人又回來報告說，店主的話果然眞實不錯。大家都很驚異，想不出是什麽道理。於是經理和工程師就親自前去考查。店主拿出變黑的銀器來給他們看，再佈置刀叉的位置像預備僱客進餐的樣子，果然刀叉移動了頭子，都向着壁。於是店主領了他們到厨房裏取了一隻鐵鍋，放到鐵竈上去，還沒有十分接近的時候，忽然鏗的一聲，好像有一隻怪手拉了下去，就比捺牢不放鬆，要費了很大的力量才能拿下來。要是正是做菜，鍋裏的東西就有炙焦的危險了。店主還指示了別的奇怪的現象給他們看，使他們相信他說的話都是事實。</p>
<p>電廠經理和工程師經過一番研究之後，靠着科學的帮助，才能將這個疑難問題完全解决。原來這電廠分站裏靠餐館一面的壁上都是些傳導電流出入的粗電綫。這些電錢因爲鉅大電流的經過，造成了極利害的磁塲。從此發出來的磁力綫不是磚牆能遮攔得住的，必須根據科學的原理，用適當的材料才能隔去。所以餐館的一面壁上，複上了一層厚鋼板，就减少了這種紛擾了。至於銀器的變黑是和電磁沒有關孫，大概大城市空氣中間含有磁化氫一類的氣，容易使銀器的表面發黑，祗有多用些摩擦料常常摩擦保持光亮，就可以解决了</p>
<h3>火星上有人類嗎？</h3>
<p>— 又新</p>
<p>以前有許多天文家相信火星上有人類，並且比地球上人類的文化高得多。他們這樣想像的理由是　火星上的河道作直綫形　火星上有海　有空氣　有綠色的部分　最高的溫度有華氏65。　晝夜的長短和地球差不多，所以夜問不致太冷。現在望遠鏡的口徑也增大了，各種研究的方法也增加了不少。因之我們知道火星也更淸楚了。第一火星的河道並不是直綫形，火星旣是球形球面，不能畫一條綫在各方看來多是直的，因爲證明直綫是以前天文家的幻覺。他的海不反射日光，所以是沒有水的「乾海」。空氣非常稀薄，並且不含氧氣。因爲空氣稀薄的緣故，他的熱發散得很快，所以在太陽照着的地方，在他的赤道上最高有六十五度左右，在太陽照不到的一面，溫度在零下一百度。其地面的成分大　是火山灰。這樣看來，火星上很少可能有人類了。</p>
<h3>牛乳製的衣服</h3>
<p>— 金泰</p>
<p>現在世上人造材料層出不窮，用木漿製人造絲用玻璃絲織布，已不算新奇，而現在意大利米蘭（Milan）地方一廠家竟然用牛乳製成纖維，以供婦女做服裝。將十六加侖牛乳倒入所用新式機械的漏斗內，在機械的另一端便製出大量的纖維，足够做一套衣服和一件外衣。此種別開生面的纖維製法非常圓滿，故歐洲多數國家都在設廠製造。圖爲用十六加侖牛乳所製成的一身漂亮衣服。</p>
<h3>世界科學消息</h3>
<p>透明動物</p>
<p>水蚤本來不過充一種熱帶魚的珍饈，但是近年來却在科學界漸露頭角·這是因爲它有像玻璃狀的透明軀體，內部臟腑顯然可見，科學家得藉此視察動物內部生理變化之故。數年前曼格尼各夫（Metchnikoff）曾用水蚤研究白血球保衛生命的情形。他令水蚤把幾個菌胞子吞下後，發見其中有幾個開始發芽，並且侵入它的食道的壁內。然而不久白血球即開始反攻，把菌細根摧毀，因此保全水蚤的生命。我們知道動物血液中的白血球本有保衛和治病的兩重職務，經此表演更覺信而有證。利用水蚤視察其它內部器官對於藥物發生什麼影響之例甚多，不能殫述。</p>
<p>有一種金魚名望遠鏡魚（Teleseope　fish），鱗是透明的，所以看起來如無鱗的。全身長四吋至六吋，爲半透明或全透明體。較短者透明程度尤高。它們的內部臟腑也是可見的。把少量的內分泌，高利斯，篤基寗（Cholecystokinln）射入主尾的靜脈後，膽汁即漸决從膽囊中傾囊而出。這種綠色或黃色的膽汁隨後於腸內發現，已成爲一種色素。其它內部器官如心，陽，甚至流動的血液，在適當狀况下也能看見。因此動物內部機關的運用無需解剖或殺傷而得直接窺見。這是水蚤之外又是一個足資研究的透明動物。</p>
<p>— （美國工業公報和藥物雜誌鴛）</p>
<p>新式軍火</p>
<p>美國墨西哥城駱司得（Rost）君最近發明一種新式軍火，業由美政府核准專利。這種軍火的爆炸物是汽油和氧。它們在一種槍內能够適度化合而後燃燒。它們的爆炸力較普通火藥力大而造價較廉，據說，這是它們的特點。不但如此，震動，溫度和摩擦均不影響到子彈，并且也沒有自動爆炸的危險。</p>
<p>應用這種爆炸物有二種方法。第一種用一枝特製的槍，把少量汽油注射入內儲氣酸鉀（能放出氧氣）的特製彈壳內，再由電使之燃燒。</p>
<p>另一種方法把汽油和氯酸鉀分別藏在彈壳的隔離腔內，仍用普通的撞針射擊法使之燃燒。</p>
<p>據發明家說，爆炸時氣體的全部燃燒即在槍管內完畢，所以槍口外，沒有特殊的火焰發現，和普通的槍不同，這是極利於夜襲之用的。這種爆炸物對於空中炸是否適用，發明家未曾言及，不過大槪信爲同樣的基本原則也可以應用於較大的炸彈云。</p>
<p>— （美國科學擷華，鴛）</p>
<p>鋁製影片</p>
<p>美國斐雪（Fischer）軟片公司近發明一種鋁製的不透明影片，用反射的方法放映，所映出的畫和所發出的聲都十分圓滿。現有的透明影戲陰畫可用來印此種金屬陽畫。</p>
<p>據報告，這種新式影片的優點頗多，最顯著的是它並不像平常賽璐珞影片一樣的容易起火，也不發生任何氣體，更不容易損毀。該公司會用一卷鋁製影片反複放映一千五百次，結果不發生任何顯明的摩損。</p>
<p>其他優點爲不皺，不裂，不生霉，且能抵抗潮濕。因爲耐熱和冷，所以在寒帶和熱帶地方都可應用；在溫帶地方，更不必說。又因爲它是不透明而兩面可用，故平常賽璐珞影片需一千尺的，因鋁製影片只消一半的長度——五百尺。加之鋁片本身的價格很低，所以這種影片的成本極小，前途正未可限量。</p>

<h3>惡習</h3>
<p>— 茂烈</p>
<p>說到陋俗，便引起了惡習。陋俗是關乎大眾的，惡習是關乎個人的。不過惡習能够推廣開來，成爲陋俗，所以個人的關係，似乎比了大眾，尤爲重要。正是：齊家治國平天下，還當從修身起始。</p>
<p>惡習很多，簡直呌人無從談起。不過在我個人的意見，例如嫖賭吃著之類，只害着犯此惡習者的本身，不害着別人，其影響還小，似可放在第二等；只有那些小之影響一團體一社會，大之影響一國家一民族的惡習，却是應該立即剷除的第一號公敵。</p>
<p>在這些第一等惡習中，我認爲嚴重要的是自私。自私的表現是搶與推。飯碗要搶，權利要搶，名譽要搶，……凡是於己有利的，不惜用盡種種手段，拼命搶。責任要推，義務要推，做錯了事要推，麻煩的事要推，……凡是勞而無功，沒有報酬的事，不惜推三阻四的推。在這一搶一推之間，什麼事都弄得烏烟瘴氣，亂七糟八，公眾的利益犧牲了，國族的利益受到了極大的損傷。總而言之，只知有己，不知有人，自私而己·自私的結果就是同歸於盡，無從自私起。</p>
<p>次於自私的是懶，對於公事的懶。明明幾分鐘可以完畢的事情，少則擱上三天五天，多則十天半個月，甚至一擱再擱，置之高閣，永遠忘記。假使一件事情要經過三五處的手續，這樣一來，有時間性的，其不成爲馬後砲者幾希，無時間性的，也就妨礙了本身與其他事件的進行。所以懶之爲害，並不多讓於自私。</p>
<p>自私與懶似乎是我們同胞的致命傷，外國人都如此說過。我們還想做人麼？還想做羣眾中的一員麼？那末我們對於這些惡習，就應該深惡而痛絕之！</p>
<p>不要以爲滔滔者天下皆是也，已經積重難返。只要人人自我做起，不顧成敗利鈍損益的自我做起；只要有此决心，有此實行，惡習的剷除，指顧聞耳！個人與公眾的健全，亦轉瞬間耳！</p>
<h3>冬之弦</h3>
<p>— 黎晨</p>
<p>「冬是一雙手，而且是粉畫的素手。」你是否定這句話麼？</p>
<p>在那屬於我們，從沒有受過蠻橫的敵人的傷害的城市裏和郊原中，冬用她的一雙手精心地裝點着，使人們的心頭充滿了堅毅，愉悅和美麗。</p>
<p>這難道是冬在歌唱麼？在這繁華的都市的旁邊，比較靜寂的衖裏，傳來的嘈嘈切切的人聲。</p>
<p>灰色的背景襯托着一個靑黑色的孤單的影子，——不，沒有陽光的天色使她的影子不能明顯地印在地上。那麼，我想，只好用幽靈樣人物來形容她吧。她的身軀跟着兩脚向前踽踽地移動，右手不停的在懷裏抽送着。這一抽一送的動作配着圓潤的調門。衖裏每一個關閉着靜寂的門，都裂開長嘴，吐出各式的人頭，一個個驚奇的目光投向同一個去處。</p>
<p>這個孤單的身子移近來，漸漸地，使人看淸那瘦削的身子外面，裹着一件褪了色而又染上穢垢的灰黑色的衣服。嘹亮的嗓子告訴我，她來自北國，那雄厚，爽直的北國。天風落下來，從那住着正在做緋色的夢的人們的高樓上落下來，吹散她的黑髪，衣服也被吹得悉悉的響。</p>
<p>「這是從遼遼的北方吹來的寒風啊，姑娘，你可曾嗅到你生長的地方的氣息？」我輕聲唸着，心靈早飛到遠方，那迢迢的遠方去。</p>
<p>「先生，聽一支小曲吧？我去……啊！前年了！前年打山東濟南府逃下來的哪！……」尖銳的嗓音在空氣中顫抖。</p>
<p>「北國的冬是峭冷的，然而是動人的。也就是這枝胡琴，在手底響着醉人的歌聲。……在溫柔的日子裏度過幼年；一個綺麗的夢境在眼前閃鑠。可是，黃河那邊掃來炸彈的驟雨，燬滅了這歡樂的美景。抱起胡琴在同是祖國而陌生的異鄉飄泊，流浪，總找不到一點枝棲。用沉重的脚步向土地叩問鄉音，土地給了一個物理的反應；在寒風裏想嗅到一點家園的氣息，寒風的回答是不斷的顫慄。肚子裏常是空空的，在這一條街和那一條巷留下一縷琴音，蕩漾……」</p>
<p>我像修道的老僧似的喃喃地念着，替她接上了一段話。</p>
<p>「幾錢，拉支小曲散散心？」這是她所渴望的「金」言。</p>
<p>然而她所渴望的豈是「幾錢」？這不過是汽車無力前進時加入的一點軋司令而已；她的歌唱難道僅僅是給人「散心」？北國的冬之讚美，彈雨下的號呼，異鄉的落寞，侵略者的殘酷，……統統在她的歌聲裏發洩了出來。</p>
<p>琴韻絕，歌聲滅，我呆立着，望着那靑黑色的影子孤零零地遠去。走過天涯海角，她要向人羣不斷地控訴·</p>
<p>誰給她一點同情？更有誰在這悲憤的乾柴上燃起燎原的復仇的怒火？</p>
<h3>無立錐之地！</h3>
<p>— 雪生</p>
<h3>南方來的消息</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>戴平萬君：自經洪靈菲君殉國以後，我們非但沒有了見面的機會，就是大家的住處也不甚曉得。我的行動，或者你還可以由友人處傳聽到一二，但關於你的行動呢，我簡直一向就沒有探聽到過。最近，自武漢退出，先去長沙南昌，後來和沫若他們分手，他們到了重慶，我更由福州而香港，而到了南洋的星加坡。</p>
<p>南洋的僑胞，箇箇都赤忱爲國，看他們的那一種熱情，那一種肯犧牲的精神，眞要使人下淚。所可惜的，是一般風氣未開，知識灌輸，還不能普遍，所以他們只知道盲目的愛國，拼命的犧牲。若使他們能更多一點知識，更有一番組織，則抗戰的礎石，就可以由南洋的僑胞團體來築起了。</p>
<p>我到星加坡來，是爲了幫星洲日報編副刊；心裏的打算，就想替南洋的知識靑年，介紹一點國內文藝界的作品，與將南洋靑年的創作，介紹一點到國內去。</p>
<p>現在，香港（託適夷與戴望舒），新疆（託茅盾），延安（託成仿吾），重慶（託郭沫若）等處，都已寫信去要求他們寫東西，收集稿件了；只有上海一方面，還沒有託人。我想請你爲我多收集些稿子寄一為，有必要時，我也可以供給你些稿子和材料。</p>
<p>此地的金融市塲，一般很富裕；但只有寫文章的稿費却不十分高。不過因匯兌的關係，所以在此地只是很低的稿費，匯到國內，可也有五元千字的樣子（最低的）。所以，我想，替上海孤島上的文化人，做一箇溝通的掮客，也許不是沒有意義的徒勞。此信刊出後，請你馬上覆我，或寫些，寄些東西來。信面但書星加坡星洲日報好了。　郁達夫謹上。二月二日。</p>
<p>此信航空寄來，昨天收到，並有附言：「請借自由談一角，披露出來，可以做一海內外的聯絡綫。」所以我將他發表在這裏，請戴平萬君以及孤島各同文注意。　編者</p>
<h3>中國的戰時樂曲（續完）</h3>
<p>— 盛慕衷</p>
<p>記得二十五年在綏遠淪陷的時候，每個靑年健兒開赴到前綫去的，都帶着剛毅的氣槪，唱着最普遍流行的一支歌曲，聶耳的義勇軍進行曲。聶耳眞是一位天才的樂曲作家，在他完成了「桃李刦」「大路」和「義勇軍進行曲」等作品之後，他的大名已經赫赫，他的作品受着社會羣眾熱烈的歡迎，可惜他不幸悲慘地死在日本！而他的歌曲却從一個城傳到另一個城，一個軍營傳到另一個軍營，在朔方冰雪的平原上，反響着他的宏亮的歌聲，「起來，不願做奴隷的人們！」在士兵們衝鋒陷陣的時候，大家又齊唱着：「冒着敵人的砲火前進，前進，進！」</p>
<p>這時在上海的歌詠運動也非常熱烈，各個學校和靑年會的歌詠團，都組織了小組的歌詠隊到許多工廠中去教授唱歌，這些工人在疲乏的工作之餘，引着高吭的唱一下，倒也很感興味。當時所教的一些歌曲像：「一二八歌」，「打椿歌」「開路先鋒」和「新女性」等等。</p>
<p>在七七盧溝橋事變之後，這類歌唱更普遍地提倡起來，原來在軍隊中和學生團體中所唱的歌曲，已在每個街頭，每個巷角，每個村子中，每處電臺上都播唱起來了。這是象徵着民族的救國精神，已發揚到了白熱的程度，只要有羣眾聚集的地方，雄壯的歌聲，像雷一般怒吼起來，使人感到羣眾力量的偉大。</p>
<p>許多的歌本，也應時地流行起來，像「靑年歌集」「大眾歌唱」和「抗×歌曲」等等，印載的都是差不多人人會唱的歌，目的在推行歌曲，售價非常低廉，所以銷路也很廣大。</p>
<p>在戰事初起的時候，許多靑年和學生，尤其是女性佔大部份，常到傷兵醫院，或難民收容所去，有時教他們唱，有時唱給他們聽，每個人聽到了宏壯的歌聲，就會不自覺地興奮着，四周的痛苦，當前的煩惱，早镕陶在莊嚴的歌聲裏。</p>
<p>現在教育部更在積極推行歌詠的工作，準備在每個城市裏，每個村子上都能聽到這些救國的歌曲，要利用歌曲的效果來宣傳國家的危機，勸導民眾投軍等等，特別組織了幾個和聲的歌詠團，每個團中各有男女團員二十人，預備旅行到各地去推行大眾的歌唱。</p>
<p>現在新流行的歌曲，已經很不少，假使你到內地去，一定可以聽到這些新鮮的樂曲！可是，上海却不能再聽到了。最近出版的一本「大眾唱」，就是新歌曲的總彙，裏面印出的歌，大都充滿着作戰的英勇精神，比先前的歌曲更激昂，更通俗化！像「打殺漢奸」「畢業上前綫」「出征別母」「我們要反抗到底」和「衝鋒號」等等。這些歌題，我們一看就可知道他歌辭的內容。</p>
<p>據說現在教育部除了推行歌唱之外，同時對於各種流行的歌曲，也加以仔細的審查，文字是否確當？樂調是否適合？爲了進行這一類工作，新成立了一個音樂教育委員會，來担負這個使命。</p>
<p>另外，還有一個全國抗戰文學聯合會，這是幾個文學家私人所組織的，也在努力提倡編造適合這大時代的新歌曲，擬定了許多歌題，用現金來酬賞應徵的作者。</p>
<p>歌詠運動，自一二八後已到了蓬勃發揚的時期，現在更走上了正軌；希望在全國的每個角落裏，每個民眾會唱那宏壯的歌曲，就從這些歌曲上，喚起了民族的偉大精神，整齊了大眾的步伐，來擊破×人侵略的迷夢！</p>
<p>聽那遠遠的地方，傳來一支歌聲罷：「中國已經突破了他的黑夜茫茫，人民已經鍛鍊了他的意志成鋼，前途已經展現了光明的希望，看，看，自救的烽火，傳遍了四方！」</p>

<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>四　死守國防綫</p>
<p>經過了一畫夜的血戰，葉團長那一團所守的國防陣綫的外圍防地，防禦工事全給敵方猛烈的砲火轟燬了，士兵也傷亡了不少。不過敵方的損失也相當重大，陣地上到處可見仆倒的屍骸，還有幾輛被地雷和手溜彈炸燬的鐵甲車坦克車歪臥在一邊。依着葉團長的意思，仍想堅守下去，還是梁團附在一旁勸諫說：</p>
<p>『敵方的火力這樣厲害，再守下去只有白白的犧牲弟兄，我看不如轉移陣地，退守國防綫。好在我們這次是長期抗戰，不在乎一時一地的得失。』</p>
<p>葉團長想了一想，也覺得實在沒有再堅守的必要於是便趁敵方的砲火稍爲稀疏時，下令全體轉移陣地，撤退到國防陣綫上去堅守。</p>
<p>所謂國防陣綫，是從長江口的福山起，經過常熟，蘇州，吳江，沿蘇嘉路南下，由北　，平望，盛澤，王江涇到嘉興，再折而東南，循嘉興平湖公路到乍浦，獨山，成一個月形的平圓綫，比較起過去的淞滬陣綫來，廣大到不止數倍以上。</p>
<p>這時候，東戰塲陣綫調整的工作業已完畢。雖然左翼還在太倉崑山一帶，右翼還在平湖一帶激戰，可是中路却被突破了滬杭鐵路綫上的楓涇，迫近到這國防陣綫的王江涇來，因此這一帶國防陣綫上的形勢，特別顯得緊張。</p>
<p>敵人似乎一貫採用着中央突破的戰略，在占領了國防陣綫的外圍防地以來，幾乎不容我軍有喘息的餘裕，很快的又追蹤緊迫過來；照例又是一陣猛烈的砲火。不過這次好像含有些試探性質，火網並沒有先前那樣密。</p>
<p>葉團長冒着砲火，在戰壕裏巡視着，對連排長指示作戰機宜，同時鄭重叮囑他們，務必死守這國防陣綫，要抱着和陣地同存亡的决心。經過了一盡夜的砲火生活，他的臉，好像黝黑了許多，不過黑中却透着光，尤其那兩顆銳利的眼珠，安置在黝黑的臉上，分外明朗。（一三）</p>

<h3>「風流寡婦」的觀感</h3>
<p>— 金丁</p>
<p>劉一新繻導，范雪朋田心主演的話劇，—風流寡婦，在綠　劇塲公演的第一天，—一月十二日，我為了要研究一下婦女問題，於是也去觀看了一次。</p>
<p>全劇的主旨，是針對着封建社會的遺毒，「寡婦守節」的痛苦，和現社會男女戀愛問題，作為劇情的主題。它形容一位閔姓的寡婦，「守節撫孤」的苦心，和一般無知的婦女，當她是一個不祥的東西。可是，一旦和卓然不羣的劉肅，戀愛以後，親戚，鄰居，以及一般的人，都要指摘她，誹謗她，這眞是使她感到深深的刺激了！　同時，在劇情中，更穿揷的表演出交際花BB女士的浪漫　，王渡和陳庚二翁的色情狂，劉肅的用情不專，在和BB綢繆以後，被伊的酒色所迷，懵然簽一字據，答應和這位可憐的寡婦，斷絕關係。</p>
<p>可是，這位可憐的寡婦，為了戀愛，却早已不顧一切的，把伊全部眞誠的愛，獻給伊的愛人劉肅了。伊怎會知道伊的愛人，早又接受了別人的愛，把伊置諸腦後，而一個多月不來看看伊呢？因此，伊是因相念而鬱鬱的生病了。在病得十分厲害的時候，伊的愛人，｜劉肅却來看伊了。他並不是來眞誠的看伊的，而為預備跟伊談判斷絕關係的事的。直等到劉肅知道伊為了自己而犧牲一切，為了自己而生病，為了自己而……，不禁也為之惻然，受着良心的譴責，立刻表示眞的愛伊，懺悔過去的錯誤，可是，這位熱情的寡婦，却不能再接受他的愛，而在伊愛人的懷抱中，永遠的分別了。……劇情的演出，大略是這樣。演員中以范雪朋（飾寡婦）的表情，最為眞切；胡了然（飾醫士）的開口舊道德，閉口之乎者也，也很發噱。田心（飾交際花BB女士）十足是一位拜金主義的浪漫女性，倒是現社會中一部份女性的代表；田曉青（飾劉肅）的始而愛這個，繼而愛那個，玩弄女性。絲亳沒有眞實的愛情，在現社會上，像他這樣用情不專，喜新厭舊的公子哥兒，恐怕也不在少數吧。最後，筆者對於本劇的觀感，一方面固然覺得：封建社會遺留下來的「寡婦守節」制度，誠然有打倒的必要；可是，對於男女的戀愛問題，也應該雙方審愼從事。朝三暮叫，用情不專的青年男女們，「風流寡婦」是值得看一看的，因為這是她們當前很好的敎訓呀。</p>

<h3>孫老元操琴記</h3>
<p>— 詩味軒</p>
<p>民十三余因事至北平，適逢孟小冬登台，孫老元操琴，蓋孫自呌天逝世，從未為人操琴，此為第一次。小冬藝術本有根柢，再經孫為指點，藝益猛進，是日貼演上天台跑城兩齣，老元右手套金指甲，長約二寸，出台時頻向台下點頭為禮，掌聲突起。初池座旁之右廂，空無一人，及老元一出，不約而來，座為之滿、若輩形非顧客，詢之案目，始悉係院主准京津琴師之請，特闢右廂招待，不取票資，迨琴聲一起，祇見廂內諸人，閉目凝神，時而贊嘆，時而擊節，其琴韻高亢清越，幾如珠走玉盤，無絲毫拖泥帶水之處。台下彩聲，幾駕小冬之上，小冬得名琴之襯托，愈唱愈勁，顧客無不嘆為雙絕。余南歸後每一憶及，猶覺餘音繞樑，後小冬不常出演，老元南走申江，一度為梅博士操琴，鬱鬱不得志，而淪落以歿，惜哉！</p>

<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一〇六）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>伶人對於吃喝嫖賭及玩弄烏獸蟲魚等的嗜好</p>
<p>王蕙芳享名在蘭芳以先，當時很為辮子大帥所賞識，後來因為他忽視了自己的藝業，每日專在放鷹上用着工夫，天一亮就起身出門，帶着大鷹往郊外去故，荒田野塚間到處都有他追逐的足跡，風吹日晒，慢慢的臉兒也黑啦，脚兒也大啦，身體也肥壯啦，滿臉上並且長了些壺疙瘩，那裏還像個婀娜嬌艷的名花旦，簡直比唱花臉的還要黑的多呢。所以聲譽一天低似一天，後來雖有一個時問改唱過小生，聊以維持生計，但他又不像妙香似的去苦心研究，所以不久又閑了下來。現在聽說靠着敎徒為生，情形很為慘悽，較之蘭芳的處境，眞有天壤之別，古人說「玩物喪志」蕙芳魷是犯了這個毛病</p>
<p>苟慧生很歡喜飼養金魚，當他住在南半截胡同的時候，單有一個小院落，栽種些樹木花草，另外擺列着許多砂缸，內蓄各色各種的金魚，雖是比不上北海及中山公園裏的大而且多，但是也很有幾條形像奇特，頗為外間所罕　的。慧生一天到晚也是忙着換水喂食，拿着全副的精神來照料着牠們，但是久而生厭。後來他在椿樹胡同購置一所新宅，每日大興土木，改建一所小花園，畫棟彫樑，各處全用紅色油漆，足足忙了半年工夫。誰知好說俏皮話的余三（叔岩）就住在慧生後面的胡同裏，天天聽到這種碰石頭，拉大鋸的聲音，他有一天　到慧生那裏向他開着玩笑道：「等你的皇宮內院造齊啦，你再來猜一猜我的袖內機關吧。」這話是因為他們同時出演新明大戲院時，余荀合唱過「探母」，所以叔岩自比為駙馬，拿慧生當了公主，這也是借此討便宜的意思。慧生自從搬到這所新居以後，單在後院設備一所清靜的書房，每日作書習畫唸唸戲本子，竟把從前玩金魚的那種嗜好，全行丟掉了。</p>

<h3>香港小呂宋　紛紛拋售外匯</h3>
<p>匯市昨以洋行曁日行等雖扒、但結款已稀、更因銀行頗肯供給、且港電與小呂宋咸起拋售、致潛勢遂略轉鬆、唯中途起伏、依然有限、交易尙旺、港匯亦稍鬆賤、乃錢兌業頻塞之故、</p>

<p>滬埠外棉交易甚為靜寂、良以年關轉瞬即屆故也、惟昨因印棉價格低廉、合豐廠會購進印棉二百包、合送廠價約七十四元餘、其他各廠因忙於結束賬冊、對於外棉毫無無進胃、外棉交易均侍之於紅盤矣、茲將昨日棉價分錄於後、</p>
<p>本棉生意仍清淡、廠方由新裕進二十支以上之美棉二百件、其他廠家無甚納胃、但同業稍有零星交易、點綴而已、蘇北一路來源不多、僅新港來一百二十五件、白為來一百五十件、茲將現棉成交情形錄左、</p>

<h3>疋頭　預測呢羢　將再高漲</h3>
<p>最近呢絨銷路清淡、本街實銷落令、客帮亦祗少數郵包遞寄、除一般國戶略有塌進外、正式營業、絕少成交、對於呢絨市面之前途、據業中預測、十九俱謂必須再漲、因鑒目今各種存貨有限、尤以普通六元起至八元止之呢絨、更形軋缺、洋行現貨、大多數早已售罄、新貨進口成本高昂、現在申織呢絨定價、一律增漲、如鴻康永永興單面花呢、每碼定價須國幣六元、（　前零剪祇有六元）、預測開春零剪、最少法幣六元七八角、諸如此種情形、故預測紅盤市價、必然特別高漲云、</p>

<h3>攫奪游擊區　繭行的詭計（續）</h3>
<p>— 孫光</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>由上述，我們可知日力對於收繭的統制，已是雷厲風行，務期實現；而牠們的實施手段，却又是一套幕後的牽綫工作。所以：這裏除掉揭發此種陰謀。正告戰區的民衆尤其是繭行行主切莫上當外，件別提出下列二種對策，以供大家的參考：</p>
<p>可說是積極方面的：那就是行主本身，認清現在來租行收繭者，魷是日方的所謂「華中蠶絲公司」的走狗，並不是中國的正當商人，租借以後，不特是租行費不能担保到手，並且要一步步的使繭行都納諸日人口袋。何况目下遊擊隊勢力極度一脹，出租與日人後的繭行，隨時隨地有被襲擊破壞的可能，那時的繭行，即不被日方正式攫奪，也將因租與日方經營故而被遊擊隊破壞，結果弄得旣組當了不愛國的汚名，又獲到陪了夫人又折兵的實果，於公於私，於名於利，都不合算。所以繭行行主碰到這種傀儡人來租行，應該竭力迥避不見，或婉言拒絕，使牠們計無所售，其次：如果巳受愚的繭行，應火速向承租人聲明種稱理由，如當地遊擊隊勢力極大等等，以期解約。必要時更應忍痛些小犧牲，將繭行行面或繭灶捣毀一部，以作解約之有力憑點。再除掉繭行行主以外，我們還希望附近的養蠶農民，避免賣繭給興此種繭行，必要時自繅土絲，再行設法出售，因為日人統制繭行後，繭價决不會跟隨絲價，故從經濟上打算，自繅土絲，亦能較為有利也。</p>
<p>是消極方面的：那就是希望當地的遊擊隊，對於此種以華人作幌子的「華中蠶絲公司」租借的繭行，在營業時應毫不姑息地切實予以破壞，使得日方也一無所獲。這；實在是我們抗戰的國策。因為我們如果自己還承認是中華民國的國民，而曉得一點「國家」「民族」「自己」「敵人」等等時，誰都不會願意看着自己辛勤所獲的財產，來供給敵人白白地享用的。所以這點，我們不但很熱烈的盼望當地遊擊隊來執行，同時也希望就近的血性青年，來補助這種破壞工作。總之；對自己無法享受利用的東西，寗可加以破壞，絕對不許被人利用。這樣，敵人侵略的目的，就永遠不克達到了；所以對這種戰區經濟攫奪控制的陰謀之破壞，實在是遊擊隊破壞工作中的最重要課題；也是戰區民衆報國的絕好機會。（完）</p>

<h3>去舊更新</h3>
<p>— （海嘯）</p>
<p>過年眞是一年一度的快樂節，年常慣例地一到年夜關頭，大家便一致地會忽忙起來：彼來此去送年禮；邀朋搭友的打量支配着怎樣玩喝過新年，至於去舊迎新的遺風，更是免俗不了的，頭髮總得剪去制新一下：就是理髮店里雙倍加價；浴堂里也得去把整年一身的晦氣齷齪浴個清脫；服裝呢，自然，尤其在制新之例，如此好像纔能算是「爆竹一聲萬象更新」，不致辜負了這新春的光臨。每年每年都老是這樣地過的，人們的心理，好像纔算是去舊迎新了。</p>
<p>不！這樣更新不了什末的，我們要提倡澈底切實地來實行新的更新，自然舊有的更新，我們不是絕對地完全革除，只是要根據事實的需要來而决定的。那麼新的更新怎樣更呢？</p>
<p>今年仍是抗戰年，不消說我們的更新，是要適應抗戰的，大家應自我檢討一下過去一年來，對於抗戰中的祖國，是否供獻了應盡的力量？有否幹錯了對於祖國不利的一椿事，不管牠小如蒼蠅，我們都要揭發檢點出來，為改革了奮有的錯誤，在歲序伊始的新春里，開始我們新的進步生活。比如：在這一年中上海的節約獻金工作，我是否盡量實行了呢？要是沒有的話，那麼就得在新年里開始盡量去實行，譬如影戲可少看一趟，酒得少喝一次，麻雀少叉一回，你雖然節約了一些，但在死亡綫上掙扎着的難胞，他們是受惠了不少呢！去舊更新的地方實在多得很，再如：我是否販買過仇貨？是否對於抗戰必勝的信念，發生過動搖？是否散佈過淆亂人心的謠言？是否對於反漢奸的工作做得够嗎？總之任何行動在整個民族利害上，不論是直接的或間接的，都可以檢討一下。錯誤的更改了實行新的正確的；好的進步的還得發揚它，更加以新的努力。二</p>
<p>一年總的檢討，是要詳盡坦白地把優點弱點的地方揭露出來，不然放任了弱點，便會促進了它的擴大，自然更談不上更新了；優點也是不能抹煞的，我要加以更新的發揚，撇開了這樣的去舊迎新，都是虛偽而誤解的。</p>
<p>年關迫近了，大家準備着。</p>
<p>號砲一聲響，抗戰更新年！</p>
<p>學生：「先生，你説在馬路上不能吃東西的嗎，你爲什麽在嚼大餅呢？」</p>
<h3>報市素描</h3>
<p>— 吉士</p>
<p>報紙———這傳播國際視聽，宣揚世界文化的唯一精神糧食，在各大城市中，都飛躍地進步着，而成為民眾敎育上最偉大的機構了！它不但報導政治經濟的演進，同時又磨練着廣大文化戰士，努力寫作生產，揭發社會各層的形形色色，固然要是地球上的報紙全絕了跡，還不致使人類一切活動都停頓下來，但至少會减低像目前那麼錯綜複雜的動態，甚至會影響整個社會不停息的進展！</p>
<p>同樣，在這擁有四百萬居民的東方第一大都市———上海，它正緊握着全國經濟文化的重心，為外洋進出口集散的要衝，尤以開闢國際市塲後的租界繁榮，使上海儼然成一個國際性的貿易港，因此報業在此地的發展，當然亦蒸蒸日上而執全國各地的牛耳了！迎合天眾低級趣味的報紙，固然何止十百，卽像銷數突破上萬的大報，也為數極衆，自從上海淪為孤島後，雖有一部份報紙曾遷往內地繼續出版，滬地報市曾比較冷寂了一個相當的時期，然不久，為着適應國內外緊張局勢之情報起見，很多洋商主辦的日報，便像雨後春筍般地活躍起來，報市又回復了過去的熱烈盛况，倘使說孤島是個巨型的人體，那末報紙的上市就如一股不可遏止的宏流，從心臟內出發，分頭找他們各自的主額，融流於血液中，循着血管作迅速的輸送，一件件人間世的動靜，由報市的根據地，在極短的時間內，立刻就能帶到每個讀者的眼前，而將電訊與見聞，傳遍了整個都市的每條街頭巷尾！</p>
<p>上海報業的發祥地——望平街，本是條羣集會萃的街道，可是近來這兒已不是唯一的大本營了，靠着愛多亞路的東端，報館的林立，被吸收了幾乎超越半數以上的市塲，每當清晨與傍晚，躑躅於這一帶街頭的報販者，遠望誠像個被煽動了的蜂窠，密集地搖動着在等候從報館內裝出的新鮮報紙！早上晨光微煦的當兒，報市已開始活躍了！不久像潮湧一樣向各方四散，隨着熱烈的喊報聲，便充塞了。沉靜的空間。</p>
<p>戰後報紙的夜市，是有着飛速度的進展，目前很多日報都有晚刋之發行，只是在出版的時間上稍有參差的不同，以致夜市從午後三四點鐘起，甚至會延續到深夜的！要是有特殊消息的話，卽使在午夜更深時，亦不妨來一次三十二開的小型號外，包管會搶之一空，為着夜報所刋大抵是當天消息，因此就很合讀者口味！隨着都會的神秘之夜生活，報市也比較最悠長而狂烈了！實際上從黎明到午夜，報市是永不停息地被支撑着市面，不過在發報的一剎那，更呈露蜂湧罷了！</p>
<p>報市是都會的生命綫，它有着一切至高無上的權威，它能激刺人們的心靈，在不同的立塲上，產生出與奮與沮喪的情緒，它永不停止，日以繼夜地在輝煌的都市心臟地帶活躍着！</p>
<h3>啓事</h3>
<p>投稿諸君鑒：</p>
<p>一月份稿費，業已結出，請具條蓋章，於十五，十六，十七三日內，每日下午向本館會計處領取為荷。　春秋編輯室</p>
<h3>辦公室中</h3>
<p>— 却爾</p>
<p>這里的辦公室，不是洋行買辦或是職員的辦公室，這里是被愛倫坡稱為「二十世紀是兒童的世紀」的一個敎育兒童的小學校的辦公室，不錯，「二十世紀是兒童的世紀」，可是，這個「兒童的世紀」却就在這個小小的佈置得非常簡陋的「辦公室中」也表現出滿佈着侵略者砲火的硝礦的氣息。</p>
<p>因為今天是開學的第一天，老師們有的穿着一身破舊了的學生裝，有的穿着厚胖胖的老布棉褂兒；女老師們呢，陰丹士林布的罩袍上加着一件半舊不新的絨頭繩衫；雖然衣衫並不怎樣好，可是頭髮却都是新理過的。他們是這樣地忙碌着，招待着小朋友們的家長。</p>
<p>他們那樣慇勤的招待，非常恭敬的，令人會想起旅館中的茶房之流者來。然而，這是上海被人稱為衖堂學校一的所謂「私立小學」的一種一般的現象，這現象，在別種人看來是不免有點兒卑賤，然而在當過小學敎師如我這樣的人，看來是覺得心頭猶如刀割一般的痛苦的！—中國的「小學敎師」！……。</p>
<p>「戰爭」曾使上海的「衖堂小學」起過極度的恐慌，可是「戰爭」却也給上海的一衖堂小學」帶來了時形的繁榮，然而，在這繁榮中，却又呈露着一幅「戰爭」的悲慘之圖來！這幅「悲慘之圖」，是殘暴的侵略者用着我們中國的同胞們的鮮血描繪成功的！</p>
<p>一個年老的「老先生」，戴着一幅老光的眼鏡，端端正正地坐在一隻舊的籐椅子里，胸前的那變脫褪了「泡力斯」的寫字檯上，放着大硯池一隻，筆架一架，算盤一把，以及一些「寫字檯」上必需應用的如水壺漿糊之類的東西。「老先生」大槪是這小學校里的校長吧，他正在靜靜地應付着圍在「寫字檯」四邊的家長們，他的右手拿着十枝毛筆，左手按在並沒有寫過幾張的學費收條簿上。</p>
<p>「老先生！可不可以减去一點呢？實在是，我們逃難出來的，他的父親又沒有生意，可是小孩子總不好不讀書書呀！唉，老先生！。就减去一點吧！……二這是一個年紀的在六十左右的老太婆的話，她的左邊，是一個十歲左右的小孩子，瘦瘦的臉孔上，兩隻限睛並不靈活地閃動，只是呆呆地瞧着老先生。</p>
<p>老先生皺了一皺眉頭，正想說話，可是另一個少婦嚮着硬繃繃的寗波話開口了：</p>
<p>「老先生！像我們吧，自從打仗以来，他的爸不落掉生意還算大運氣呢！現在，薪俸是打着折扣的！所以，也想請求老先生减去一點學費」！</p>
<p>另一個一老頭子」家長，嚥了嚥口唾，也顫抖抖地開口說話了：</p>
<p>「是的，老先生！現在的當口，誰不尷尬呢？只好請老先生為着普及敎育起見，减輕我們一點負担吧！唉！小孩子如果放在外邊吧，實在會放壞的！……」</p>
<p>「老先生」的眉頭是越皺越緊了，他向四面一看，見是「辦公室中」擠了很多送子弟來上學的家長們，他覺得很為難，如果答應吧，可是這例却不能開的！如果不答應吧，假使學生子眞的因此而不來讀了，不是一個個失掉麼？他搖了搖頭，可是總於進樣說了：</p>
<p>「這是無淪如何不可能的！不過，這們，是的，……」</p>

<h3>England Continues to Protest to Japan; Arita Still Parries with Empty Words; France Plans to Consult with Britain and the United States Before Further Negotiations with Japan; Fierce Fighting Breaks Out in Southern Hainan Island; Japanese Army Unlikely to Occupy the Entire Island</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Robert Craigie, on behalf of the British government, lodged a protest with Japan today regarding the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island. At 9:30 this morning, the British Ambassador met with Foreign Minister Arita, presenting him with a formal note from the British government requesting an explanation from Japan. The content of the British note was the same as that presented by the French Ambassador yesterday morning, namely, requesting Japan to explain the purpose, duration, and nature of its occupation of Hainan Island. Arita's explanation to the British Ambassador was the same as the assurance previously given to the French Ambassador, namely, that the Japanese military occupation of Hainan Island would not exceed military necessity, and that Japan had no territorial ambitions on the island. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Following the French and British governments successively lodging representations with the Japanese government regarding the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island, demanding explanations of the reasons for this action, its nature, and its duration, it is now reported by well-informed sources here that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has submitted a reply, the main points of which are as follows: The Japanese occupation of Hainan Island is purely for strategic military reasons, the goal being to destroy China's resistance; Japanese troops will continue to occupy the island until the goal is achieved; The Japanese government has no intention of threatening the interests held by Britain and France. The British Foreign Office is currently studying this reply, and the British and French governments will consult with each other to decide on a response. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to unofficial reports received here today, the Japanese navy and army have begun to establish defenses on Hainan Island, apparently with the intention of establishing a military fortress and turning it into a fortified naval and air base. The French government will immediately investigate this report. The report also stated that within hours of occupying the island, the Japanese army began designing and building an airfield, and yesterday began expanding the coastline to accommodate the entry of large battleships. Government officials stated that France plans to consult with Britain and the United States before lodging another protest with Japan, but whether this protest is aimed at the current military developments on Hainan Island, or whether it is a renewed protest due to France's dissatisfaction with Japan's response to the previous protest, officials have not made clear.

<h3>Japanese Army Invades, Heavy Casualties and Damage</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) External News: Japanese Marines invaded southern Hainan Island this morning, landing near Sanya Bay, west of Yulin, and are engaged in fierce fighting with Chinese defense forces. According to military news from Shaoguan, the Japanese army invading Hainan Island advanced along the road from Xinying, Made Port, and Dalong Bay towards Qiongzhou. Chinese security regiments and guerrillas are resisting them. It is reported that the British and French governments are secretly discussing joint measures to deal with Japan. Long Yun stated that the purpose of Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is to directly threaten Annam and indirectly monitor Britain and France, not to attack Guangxi. Democratic countries should adopt a tough stance to deal with it, which would be practically helpful. (Special dispatch, 9 p.m., 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news received this morning by foreigners outside Guangzhou Bay, the Japanese army invading south from Qiongzhou was ambushed yesterday afternoon 20 kilometers south of Qiongzhou, suffering heavy casualties. The fighting between Qiongzhou and Ding'an is very intense. (Express dispatch, 14th) (Tokyo) The Japanese army is currently advancing south from northern Hainan Island. Japanese Marines also landed safely at Sama (transliteration) in the southern part of the island at dawn today, repelling the defending forces, and are currently advancing towards a certain location. According to reports from the battlefield, the Marines then split into two groups, one advancing eastward and the other westward. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news from foreigners outside Guangzhou Bay, the Japanese army on Hainan Island is currently building a large-scale airfield and other defensive works outside Haikou, seemingly with the intention of staying for a long time. Clear cannon fire could still be heard in the Haikou area last night, indicating that the Japanese army invading south from Qiongzhou has not made much progress. Yesterday afternoon, Japanese aircraft flew over Xuwen and Hai'an, across from Haikou, bombing for two hours, causing heavy material losses. The situation on the Leizhou Peninsula is currently very tense. In order to avoid unnecessary sacrifices, the Chinese military authorities have ordered residents along the coast of the Leizhou Peninsula to evacuate to the interior as soon as possible. (Express News Agency, 14th) (Hong Kong) According to news received here, the Japanese army in Qiongzhou is currently invading in two directions, one attacking Wenchang in the south, and the other aiming at Ding'an. Chinese troops are intercepting them separately. Yesterday, many Japanese planes flew to Wenchang, Ding'an, Danxian, Changjiang and other places to bomb, and countless innocent people were killed and injured. (Express News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to reliable foreign sources, reports from a certain foreign news agency that the Haikou Customs Commissioner, Smith, has agreed to hand over the management of Haikou Customs to the Japanese side are absolutely untrue. It is said that yesterday afternoon, the Japanese side sent Matsudaira, the former Deputy Consul in Guangzhou, and two Japanese naval and army officers to the customs to meet with Commissioner Smith, demanding the takeover, but were refused by Smith. Negotiations are still underway between the two sides. (Express News Agency, 14th) (Chongqing) According to Chinese sources, the fighting on Hainan Island is currently focused on Haikou and the coastal areas. Powerful forces from all parts of Hainan Island are now concentrated behind Qiongzhou, preparing for a counterattack on Qiongzhou. The local Li people on the island have also joined the local army to participate in the war of resistance. According to military observers close to the front line, the war on Hainan Island need not be too pessimistic, because the Japanese army will never be able to occupy the entire island, because Hainan Island is extremely large, comparable to one of the other provinces of mainland China, and contains many high mountains and forests, making it a good barrier for long-term resistance. According to reports, French warships are now concentrated at the eastern end of the Leizhou Peninsula (i.e., Guangzhou Bay), taking a monitoring attitude towards the Japanese navy. As for Beihai, it is currently peaceful and quiet. The Japanese air force is currently using Weizhou Island as a base. (Associated Press, 13th)</p>
<p>Shaoguan A part of the Japanese mechanized unit has been transported to Qiongya. On the 13th, they advanced towards Jinjiang City (southwest of Chengmai County). A certain regiment of the Chinese army rose up to resist, and the hand-to-hand combat was very fierce. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties, and the Chinese army also suffered considerable sacrifices. The battle is still ongoing near Jinjiang. In addition, many Japanese planes were dispatched over the outskirts of the city to scout and bomb. (Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>US Destroyer Heads to Haikou</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The American destroyer "Edsall" departed from here yesterday for Haikou. At the same time, a US Navy spokesman said that if American nationals on Hainan Island wish to evacuate, they will be provided with evacuation facilities. It is reported that there are currently 25 American nationals on Hainan Island, most of them in the Haikou area. At the same time, the US destroyer "Alden" also departed from here yesterday for Haiphong, reportedly to resupply US Navy personnel currently stationed in Chongqing, and to send people to rotate with those currently stationed in Chongqing. These people will all take the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway and then go to Chongqing. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Navy Department recently announced that the destroyer "John D. Edwards" belonging to the US South China Fleet is scheduled to travel to the northern coast of Hainan Island, China, on the 14th of this month for a "routine" voyage. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<h3>In Southern Henan and Northern Hubei, Chinese Guerrillas Achieve Repeated Victories; Counties Such as Guangshan, Luoshan, and Jingfu Are All Recovered; A Certain Chinese Unit Attacks Nanhai Airfield, Destroying Several Japanese Aircraft</h3>
<p>Zhumadian In southern Henan and northern Hubei, Chinese guerrillas have recently achieved repeated victories, and the Japanese army is at a loss. Currently, counties such as Huangchuan, Shangcheng, Zhou Shi, Guangshan, Luoshan, and Jingfu have been successively recovered by the Chinese army, and there are no traces of the Japanese army within the borders of these counties. (Dispatch, 14th) Shashi Chinese guerrilla forces near Wuhan are growing stronger by the day and have now approached the urban area. The Japanese army is extremely panicked. A few days ago, a certain elite unit of the Chinese army attacked Luojia Mountain and Nanhai Airfield. The Japanese army was caught off guard and fired wildly with artillery, shaking the three towns. After burning several Japanese aircraft and destroying the Japanese airfield, the Chinese army completely withdrew. (Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<p>Shanxian A certain businessman who had just arrived in Henan from Yuncheng said that a few days ago, a large Chinese air force unit flew to Yuncheng again to bomb, causing heavy losses to the Japanese army. At that time, there were 19 Japanese planes parked at the airfield, of which 11 were destroyed and 4 were severely damaged. Coincidentally, a Japanese army unit was concentrated at Huijia Camp for training when the Chinese planes dropped dozens of bombs, causing many Japanese casualties. (Dispatch, 14th) (Chongqing) Renxian, Hebei, was recovered on the 11th by Shi's troops, annihilating more than 500 Japanese soldiers. The remaining Japanese soldiers fled to Xingtai, and the North China guerrillas have shattered the Japanese encirclement. (Special dispatch, 14th) (Hong Kong) Collapsed dispatch: The Japanese army in Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi are all taking a defensive posture, and the war situation is quiet. The Japanese army in Chahar, Suiyuan, Henan, and Yiyi are more active and are constantly engaged in fierce battles with the Chinese army. Currently, Fujii is in southern Hebei, and Umezu has arrived in Taiyuan. A part of the Japanese army in western Shandong has opened up southern Hebei, and the Chinese army is intercepting them separately. (Special dispatch, 9 p.m., 14th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>How Will Britain and France Respond to Japan?</h3>
<p>The Japanese army has landed on Hainan Island, China, and the French and British ambassadors to Tokyo successively lodged inquiries with Japanese Foreign Minister Arita on the previous two days, requesting explanations; these matters are published in the newspapers of yesterday and today. The content of the British and French inquiries has not been published, and we have no way of knowing the details; but purely speaking within the scope of diplomacy, the relevant treaties, agreements, and statements, as well as the promises made by Japan time and again, are not only rich in information, but also full of arguments, which cannot be evaded by the other party's excuses; considering that the official announcement from Japanese Foreign Minister Arita in response to the British and French ambassadors, seems to indicate that the two ambassadors have not tried their best to argue based on diplomatic principles. Perhaps, seeing through that diplomacy is ineffective, they did not want to waste words; they only used international common practice to inquire for the time being, and only fulfilled their duty to the minimum extent within the scope of diplomacy. Although, according to common sense and reason, forcing the other party to perfunctorily deal with it with deception, is it not better to do nothing? Then why go through this trouble? Even knowing that the other party will definitely deal with it with deception, and not intending to refute it with righteous and strict words, but only bowing to move forward, murmuring and yielding, saying yes repeatedly, and retreating with bowing, is this not exposing oneself as incompetent and cowardly, and is it not inviting the humiliation of being deceived? China encounters robbery, while Britain and France encounter trickery, the methods encountered are different; therefore, China is forced into tragedy, and Britain and France are relatively pitiful, but they are both the most sympathetic countries in the world. China's war of resistance has lasted for more than eighteen months, how can Britain and France, both government and public, be startled by the misery of being divided and conquered, which is about to happen to themselves, and urgently take action outside the scope of diplomacy!</p>
<p>What will Britain and France do after the inquiry? Saying that diplomacy is ineffective, how do you know that diplomatic skills have not been exhausted. If so, not only this response from Arita is something that can be anticipated by those who have experienced the world, and the hypocrisy and deception are so extreme, which is not unexpected at first; even if another protest is made, it will inevitably be the same unexpected result. Did Arita not say that Japan has no territorial ambitions for Hainan Island? What is territory? The Northeast is Chinese territory, but Japan's oppression, exploitation, and various forms of autocracy and control in Northeast China far exceed what their warlords can impose within the three islands; Japan still says repeatedly that it is the "Manchukuo" and that Japan has no territorial ambitions; by analogy, Japan does not necessarily have to say that it will seize Hainan Island as territory. Did Arita not say that the timing and nature of the occupation of Hainan Island will not exceed military necessity? Japan is fighting a war against China that has nothing to do with one island, but it still uses military necessity as an excuse to occupy it; then, with today's international arms race being boundless, can there be a day when it is said that this island is not needed; with the increasing sharpness of international relations in the future, can it not be said that it is the so-called "lifeline of the empire," the so-called "New Order in East Asia," and the so-called "Peace in the Pacific," so this island is even more needed militarily. Hundreds of inquiries, hundreds of protests, will result in two hundred of such replies. Inferring their intentions, there will be a day when there will be no need for such a reply, that is, the invasion of China will be successful, and the management will be deeply rooted; the fertile land of 40 million square miles and 450 million Chinese people, and all of China's resources, material resources, and human resources, will be used for their arms expansion and hegemony without any scruples in the world. European and American countries will swallow their anger and silently withdraw from East Asia with the spirit of extreme freedom and the method of extreme peace; Britain and France will no longer inquire about Hainan Island! Inferring their intentions, the date is not far away; the day when the totalitarian countries have grown their feathers a little is the time when the democratic countries will be slowly executed; Annam, Borneo, Burma, and the Philippines are all on the chopping block, and Hainan Island is just the beginning.</p>
<p>There is also a noteworthy hint in Arita's response. He said that the Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island is to "weaken General Chiang's resistance forces and promote their collapse," which is another deceitful statement, because weakening is Japan's distraction and weakening of its own aggressive forces; however, what can be clearly refuted is that the fate of Hainan Island cannot be changed by your diplomatic inquiries, and the fate of Hainan Island is actually determined by the war of resistance led by Chairman Chiang. With this hint, Britain and France, who are uneasy about the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island, only have to use the greatest determination, the strongest perseverance, and the most agile methods to help China's war of resistance to the greatest possible extent. France once worried that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island would threaten Annam, so it disregarded China's right to transport goods according to the Sino-French Yunnan-Vietnam Railway Treaty, disregarded the League of Nations' resolution to provide as much assistance as possible to China to prevent the weakening of China's resistance forces, disregarded the economic prosperity of Annam as a result, disregarded the profits from the transportation of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, disregarded the most friendly relations between China and France, and accepted Japan's demand not to transport Chinese military supplies. How long has it been since Japan responded to France with the fact that the Japanese army landed on Hainan Island. Britain once prevented China from destroying Hankou for immediate petty profits and compromised with Japan on the tariff issue; how long has it been since Japan responded to Britain with the fact that these are all what we have captured and you are not allowed to interfere. At the time, and even now, it is very excusable for Britain and France to compromise; now that various facts have shown that compromise cannot achieve peace, then besides responding to Japan with effective actions, what other way is there, or what other hope is there! What is effective action, it is impossible to list them all; focusing on the matter at hand, first provide China with as much convenience as possible for the transportation of military supplies through the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, as a response to the Japanese army's brazen landing on Hainan Island; and provide strong assistance to the war of resistance in other ways, as a response to Japan's blatant statement to eliminate China's resistance forces; these are just a few examples.</p>
<h3>Japan's Invasion and Occupation of Hainan Island Is a Problem for the Entire Pacific; Democratic Countries Can Only Take Tough Actions Against Japan; The Chinese Branch of the International Peace League Appeals to the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The Chinese branch of the International Peace League recently telegraphed the League of Nations, exposing the Japanese army's ambition to land on Hainan Island and deeply hoping that the United Kingdom, France, the United States, the Netherlands, and the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty will pay attention to it, because the Japanese army's motive for landing on the island is entirely to strategically control the Tokyo Bay, surround the Philippines, and isolate the traffic between Hong Kong and Singapore, so that once the Pacific War breaks out, Japan can cope with the joint actions of the British and American navies. Therefore, the Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island is not only a matter related to China and Japan, but a problem for the entire Pacific. All countries with interests related to the Pacific should not neglect it. If the Japanese gain a foothold in Hainan Island, the international situation will greatly change. The association also said that if the countries still adopt written protests on this matter, it will be absolutely ineffective, because the Japanese only know that force is an effective action, so if democratic countries want to preserve their prestige and interests, they can only take tough actions to deal with Japan. (Associated Press, 13th) (Chongqing) This morning, the Central Daily News published an editorial ridiculing Japan's claim that the main purpose of occupying Hainan Island was to cut off China's transportation of military equipment through Vietnam. It is said that well-informed sources are all familiar with the fact that China's military equipment and munitions do not enter the interior through Vietnam or the Leizhou Peninsula. The Japanese invasion and occupation of Hainan Island is purely to obtain an important naval and air base in the western Pacific to threaten Guam and Hawaii. The Ta Kung Pao also wrote an article on the Japanese army's occupation of the island, saying that France did not allow Chinese military equipment to be transported through Vietnam because Japan guaranteed that it would never occupy Hainan Island. However, although France faithfully fulfilled the agreement, Japan has now landed on Hainan Island. France should now know that fear and compromise can only encourage aggressor countries, and the only effective way to deal with force is force. France should now allow China's military equipment to pass through Vietnam. (Reuters, 14th) (London) Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek said that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is the most important event since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, and the result will threaten the traffic between Singapore and Australia, the security of the Philippines and Annam, and the joint actions of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Pacific. (Express News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Democratic Countries Should Not Ignore the Troubles in the Pacific</h3>
<p>(London) The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island has been continuously commented on by various newspapers here. The Daily Mail reported that, "From the perspective of the United Kingdom and France, the Japanese army's move is indeed what the Ministry of Foreign Affairs official Butler said in the House of Commons last June, 'enough to cause unpleasant disputes'. The possible negative impact of this is still too lightly said by Undersecretary Butler. Since the occurrence of this matter, the feelings expressed by Chinese General Chiang Kai-shek and the comments published by the Italian authorities instructing the country's newspapers, although very different, both believe that this move has created a new situation in the Pacific, and has imposed a serious threat to the interests held by various democratic countries, which is the same. Moreover, France has already felt pressure in the Mediterranean, and now it has encountered misfortune in the Far East. Is it a tacit understanding between the signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact to echo each other? If the situation is like this, how can various democratic countries focus all their attention on the West and ignore the troubles in the Pacific? Even for the United States, the impact it feels is no less than that of its European allies, which is also very obvious. As for the United Kingdom, we now have two major autonomous territories (referring to the Canadian and Australian Federations) and many colonies, all of which rely on the Pacific traffic line for their lifeline, which is no different from the three islands of England relying on the navigation of the North Sea, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Red Sea to maintain their survival." (Havas, 14th)</p>
<p>Manila According to news from Singapore, the motive for Japan's occupation of Hainan Island is purely to use the island as a powerful submarine base. The island is located in a central location and can strategically attack Singapore and Annam to the west, and the Philippines to the east. Commercially, it can control the trade routes of European and American countries to the Far East. In short, Japan's occupation of this island has dealt a major blow to the Philippines' hopes for independence. At the same time, Hong Kong's strategic position has also disappeared as a result. Although France is working hard to build military ports in Annam, it has also suffered a serious threat. Today, the Philippines News Paper commented on Chairman Chiang's views on the Japanese army's landing on the island, saying that although Chairman Chiang's words are to attract the attention of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France, and urge them to impose sanctions on Japan, what Chiang said is also a very true fact, so all countries related to the Pacific should pay 12 points of attention. The report also said that the United States' views on Japan have changed greatly. The Japanese army's occupation of Hainan Island will definitely accelerate this change in the United States' views. According to a general survey of the American people, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, they have always been unwilling to interfere much in Far Eastern affairs. Fortunately, President Roosevelt has been constantly trying to attract their attention, so the American people have gradually increased their concern for the Far East, which is very gratifying. (Associated Press, 14th) (London) The Japanese army's landing on Hainan Island has been commented on by The Daily Telegraph (formerly known as the organ of former Foreign Minister Eden), saying that the Japanese army's sudden move has several meanings. Its direct impact is to threaten the interests of the United Kingdom and France, and the occurrence of this matter is also developing at the same time as the tension in the European situation, which is even more sufficient to prove that the extortion plans of the other two signatory countries of the Anti-Comintern Pact are echoing each other. Regarding the discussion of revising the Anti-Comintern Pact into a military alliance, the authorities of Germany, Italy, and Japan have been conducting discussions these days. The plan for military and air bases in the United States, if observed in this way, is not without reason. In addition, Japan has obtained the encouragement of the totalitarian countries in Europe, taking advantage of the situation to threaten the interests held by the United States in the Pacific, which is enough to make American public opinion see the totalitarian countries in Europe more and more deeply.

<p>Adapting to the Needs of the Second Phase of the War of Resistance</p>
<h3>The Political Department of the Military Council Convenes a Political Training Conference to Discuss the Progress of the Work and Review Various Proposals in Groups; Minister Chen Attends in Person; Chairman Chiang Also Attends and Delivers Instructions</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) In view of the fact that politics is more important than military affairs in the second phase of the War of Resistance, and in order to implement the resolutions of the Fifth Plenary Session on political training work and to actively promote political training work to meet the needs of the second phase of the War of Resistance, the Political Department of the Military Council specially convened a meeting of senior political training personnel to discuss the progress of political training work and to review the proposals in groups. The meeting period is from the 1st to the 8th of the month, a total of eight days. Minister Chen attended in person to preside over the meeting. On the morning of the 1st, a opening ceremony was held and Chairman Chiang attended and delivered instructions, giving detailed instructions on the shortcomings of past political training work, the improvements that should be made in the future, and the cultivation of political workers. After that, general meetings were held every day. In addition to the written work reports, the attendees also gave more detailed oral reports. The proposals were reviewed in groups, including (1) the Political Training Coordination Group, with a total of 27 proposals, including the enrichment, cultivation, and training of political workers, specific plans for various tasks, improving the awareness and belief of the military and civilians, the connection, supervision, and reporting of work, and the development of party affairs in the army; (2) the Civil Training Group, with a total of 28 proposals, including the civil affairs organization and guidance responsibilities, the acceptance and training of youth, the control and utilization of human and material resources, and the work behind enemy lines; (3) the Propaganda Group, with a total of 27 proposals, including the guidance of propaganda work, the supply of propaganda materials, and artistic propaganda; (4) the Personnel Group, with a total of 38 proposals, including organization, powers, and personnel; (5) the Management Group, with a total of 25 proposals, including the budget, funding, and issuance procedures, the issuance and auditing system for clothing and equipment, and the savings and assistance for political workers. Each group conducted separate reviews, formulated reports, and submitted them to the general meeting for discussion and decision. The resolution was passed and the meeting closed successfully on the 13th. (Dispatch, 14th)</p>
<h3>A Japanese Plane Forced to Land; Aviation Colonel and Six Others All Perished</h3>
<p>(Yichang) On the morning of February 1st, a heavy rainstorm swept across central Hubei. A Japanese heavy bomber, forced to land in the skies above Shayang, came down near Shazhou, thirteen *li* northwest of the town. Spotted by Chinese troops, it was fired upon. The Japanese plane struggled back into the air but, with its nose damaged, could only make it across the Xiang River before crashing again near Jiukou. Those aboard found a small boat in the river, killed the boatman, and sped downstream. As they passed Shayang, Chinese river defense sentries ordered them to approach the shore for inspection. Disregarding the order, the Chinese guards pursued in a boat. Amidst the turbulent river, they closed to within a hundred meters near Xincheng, a dozen *li* from Shayang. The Japanese opened fire on the Chinese soldiers, who returned fire. The Japanese hastily threw documents, items, and machine guns into the river. The boat then stopped. Chinese troops boarded, finding four Japanese dead and two severely wounded. The two wounded died upon reaching the shore. The boat was found to contain various important charts, as well as “thousand-stitch” amulets, personal diaries, and other items. The reporter personally saw the emblems, armbands, and business cards belonging to the six Japanese, all identifying them as Aviation Colonel Watanabe Hirotaro, Lieutenant Sato Tadayuzo, Warrant Officer Takahashi Fukujiro, wireless employee Izumisawa Nobuo, and maintenance crew members Kasuya and Sasuke Shinjuro.

<h3>Effective Remedy for Chilblains: Unbroken Swelling Subsides the Same Day, Broken Ones Heal Soon</h3>
<p>Chilblains are caused by stagnant blood. The initial symptoms are redness and swelling, causing unbearable pain and itching. Once ulcerated, pus flows, and the pain becomes even more intense. This condition is especially prevalent in winter, yet effective remedies are scarce, causing much suffering. This year, Zhengwei Pharmacy (at the intersection of Yinghua Street and Er Ma Road) has developed two miraculous medicines: (1) Chilblain Relief Water, specifically for unbroken chilblains. Upon application, pain and itching cease immediately, and redness and swelling quickly subside. (2) Pearl White Jade Cream, specifically for ulcerated chilblains. Upon application, it removes necrotic tissue and promotes new growth, ensuring a swift recovery. Relief Water is priced at 25 cents per bottle, and White Jade Cream is 40 cents per box. Telephone number: 92525. Delivery is not provided.</p>
<h3>Dropsy is Not Incurable</h3>
<p>Dropsy has long been considered an incurable disease by Chinese doctors, and Western medicine has no effective treatment either, only resorting to incisions with needles. However, the swelling soon returns, leaving little hope for patients. For over twenty years since Zhengwei Pharmacy in Shanghai (opposite the Grand Theater at the intersection of Yinghua Street and Er Ma Road) invented "Dropsy Elimination Pills," countless lives have been saved. Whether suffering from water dropsy, gas dropsy, blood dropsy in women, or infantile malnutrition with abdominal swelling, this medicine brings relief and cures the disease. Therefore, the national medical community recognizes it as a groundbreaking miracle drug and gladly recommends it. Its efficacy is both remarkable and rapid. Mild cases can be cured with two boxes, and severe cases will definitely improve with four boxes. Price: five dollars per box. A detailed instruction manual is included.</p>

<h3>250,000 Chinese Troops Launch Counteroffensive in Henan; 40,000 Japanese Soldiers Respond, Strength Extremely Weak</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to news received here, Chinese troops launched a counteroffensive against Japanese positions in Henan Province yesterday. This is the first major engagement on that front since last September. The Chinese forces achieved a major victory yesterday. The headquarters of the Chinese army was quite surprised by the weakness of Japanese resistance, since the Chinese army deployed 250,000 men to retake occupied cities and towns in Henan, while the Japanese could only field 40,000 soldiers. It is believed that the Japanese have thinned out their forces in Henan to send troops to attack Guangdong, while also allocating soldiers to defend against active guerilla forces in North China.

<h3>Japanese Planes Bomb Pingliang, Massacre Civilians</h3>

He would often say, 'If the enemy invades Wuhan, I will choose a clear riverbank and jump in to die, to inspire my children to be loyal and serve the country, and not to worry about my old age.' Last autumn, upon hearing of the fall of Wuhan, he indeed wrote a will, saying, 'When the nest is overturned, no egg remains intact. Moreover, I am old and weak and cannot save myself. The reason I hasten to end my life is to strengthen your resolve to serve the country. This is my instruction.' He drowned himself in the river, his loyalty and courage worthy of admiration."

<h3>Japanese in Hankou Again Ban Grain Transport to French Concession</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Starting this morning, the Japanese authorities in Hankou have suddenly and strictly prohibited the import of grain into the French Concession. It is understood that the purpose of this move is clearly to retaliate against the French Concession authorities for not allowing Japanese troops to pass through the French Concession. Not only do the Japanese authorities not allow food to be transported into the French Concession, but they also impose the strictest controls on Chinese or foreign nationals traveling together in groups. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>New Recruits Should Be Queried</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Ministry of Military Affairs, acting on the orders of Chiang, telegraphed all provincial military districts, instructing training officers to inquire in detail about the family situation and background of new recruits.

<h3>Japanese Troops in Hankou Obstruct Rice for Refugees</h3>
<p>(Hankou) According to investigations here, the Japanese authorities in Hankou are now refusing to issue transportation permits for rice for refugees from the International Red Cross. They are demanding that all rice be handed over to the "Hankou Peace Maintenance Association" for distribution. The International Red Cross immediately and sternly rejected the Japanese demand. Eight thousand Chinese refugees are now at risk of starvation due to the obstruction by the Japanese authorities. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Suiyuan Provincial Government Provides Relief to Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>(Hequ) The Suiyuan Provincial Government, because the Tao Li Temple in Dongsheng County was bombed by Japanese planes during a temple fair, causing many casualties among the Mongolian and Han people, and because the Eastern Community (Xincheng) of Feng County suffered extremely severe disaster due to this decisive battle, has allocated 5,000 yuan and sent personnel to provide relief. Furthermore, the provincial government's relief agency has now resumed operations and is actively handling relief efforts in disaster areas throughout the province. (13th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>France Plans to Build Naval Port at Cam Ranh Bay, Vietnam; Crucial for Controlling Chinese Navy Strategically</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to a dispatch from Paris, the French government had long considered building a naval port at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam, even before the Japanese landed on Hainan Island. Colonial Minister Mandel also planned to allocate part of Vietnam's national defense budget of 30,000 gold francs to build a commercial port that would also serve as a powerful naval base, comparable to Bizerte in North Africa and Dakar in West Africa. Now that the Japanese have landed on Hainan Island, those in charge are redoubling their efforts to make the project a reality. Cam Ranh Bay is in an excellent location, equidistant from Singapore to the south, Shanghai to the north, and the Philippine Islands to the east. Militarily, it can control southern China. Economically and commercially, it is a meeting point for Vietnam and major shipping lanes, and it can also connect with the railway line from Saigon to Hanoi, making it extremely important.

<h3>Philippines Repels Japanese Residents; Leased Properties Without Licenses to be Confiscated</h3>
<p>(Manila) According to an announcement by the Department of Agriculture today, all properties leased to foreigners without government licenses will soon be confiscated. The government will start with Davao Province, which is said to have 10,000 Japanese residents, most of whom register their businesses under Filipino names to evade the law. The properties involved are believed to be worth millions of pesos. The properties owned by other foreigners in Davao Province are insignificant. The province's hemp industry is very prosperous.

<h3>Japanese General Budget Passed by House of Representatives; Many Legislators Express Pessimism About Social and Economic Prospects</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Lower House today unanimously passed the government's regular budget of 3,694,000,000 yuan and a separate budget totaling 1,330,000,000 yuan. The special military budget of 6,000,000,000 yuan is still pending submission to the Diet. (Associated Press, 14th)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) According to Tokyo dispatches, the Japanese House of Representatives passed the general budget for the next fiscal year (from April 1 of this year to March 31 of next year) at a meeting on the 13th. However, the speeches by representatives of various parties were largely pessimistic. For example, Maeda of the Minseito Party said that the amount of government bonds that should have been issued in the past but were not was 480 million yuan two years ago, 1.08 billion yuan last year, and 1.63 billion yuan this year. It is clear that the ability to absorb government bonds is already saturated, and it is doubtful whether they can be absorbed if they are issued again this year. He expressed pessimism. Suzuki of the First Diet Members' Club said that the plan to expand productivity is extremely difficult given the current situation. With the current production mechanisms, attempting to vigorously expand productivity and mobilize resources is like climbing a tree to catch fish. The current imbalance in burden is most worrying, and companies with high profits should be made to provide relief, and so on. Tadakata of the Social Mass Party said that productivity expansion and resource mobilization should be strengthened, and the National Mobilization Law should be fully implemented. He did not know why the government was delaying it. He feared that the current administrative structure could not realize national mobilization. Miki of the Second Rest Area said that since the incident, some have taken the opportunity to reap huge profits, while others have suffered great sacrifices, leading to social unrest. The government should do something to eliminate it, and so on. Okuchi of the Seiyukai said that promoting exports is of great importance to national defense, and he hoped that the government would adopt effective policies. Rural problems are closely related to price problems, but there is no solution policy for food in this budget, which is regrettable. Although various parties had no choice but to pass the general budget due to the environment, the unresolved problems and the emotions of social dissatisfaction can all be seen. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Questions in British House of Commons Regarding Far East Events</h3>
<p>(London) At today's meeting of the House of Commons, members raised many questions regarding the situation in China. First, Hanah, a member of the government party, asked about the relationship between the authorities of the British concession in Tianjin and the Japanese authorities there. Butler, the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, replied that the British side had protested to the local Japanese authorities and the Japanese government regarding the restrictions imposed by the Japanese on the pretext of preventing anti-Japanese activities. It would continue to closely monitor the situation.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Blockading the Pearl River</h3>
<p>Butler also replied to various questions from Moreham of the Conservative Party, stating that the British government had protested to the Chinese and Japanese governments, which at various times were responsible for blockading the Pearl River, and would continue to take possible steps to reopen the waterway. As for British interests in the Jinghu, Huning, and Beining railways, their status remained the same as when he answered questions in the House of Commons on December 21 last year. The government was reviewing the matter to determine what further action could be taken effectively. Moreham then stated that Butler had stated in his reply on December 21 of last year that the authorities had been considering the matter for several months, and asked Butler to proceed with the matter expeditiously. Butler replied that this was of course the case.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Police Authority in Hongkou</h3>
<p>Butler also replied to Moreham's follow-up questions, stating that the issue of the Shanghai Municipal Council restoring police authority in the Yangtzepoo and Hongkou areas was currently being discussed by the council and the Japanese authorities in Shanghai. Therefore, it would not consult with the Japanese government on this matter for the time being, pending the outcome of these discussions. Butler went on to reply to questions from Marston, a member of the Conservative Party, stating that according to a report from Sir Philip, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, he had received news that there was little progress on the Japanese plan to organize the Yangtze River Shipping Company. It was questionable whether the new company would purchase any ships. In other respects, the situation of traffic on the Yangtze River remained unchanged. Sir Craigie, the British Ambassador to Japan, had raised the matter with the Japanese government again on January 14 of this year.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Counterfeit Currency in North China</h3>
<p>Hanah also asked about the Japanese government's refusal to order the "United Reserve Bank" and various Japanese banks to allow the purchase of foreign exchange with "United Reserve Bank" banknotes, stating that it was ineffective to apply for recognition of a currency that was not allowed to be used as an exchange medium. The British side should negotiate with the Japanese government. Butler replied that the British government felt that it was useless to make such negotiations at this time, as the Japanese government knew that the British side believed that the establishment of a non-convertible currency in North China was harmful to the interests of all countries trading there. However, we should not forget this matter.</p>
<h3>Traffic Conditions in Yunnan-Burma</h3>
<p>A certain member also inquired about the transport traffic between Burma and China, and what steps were being considered to improve the current traffic methods and open up new routes. The Secretary of State for India and Burma, Moorehead, replied that the Burmese section of the new highway was from Lashio to Kunming, and there were connecting highways on both sides. One section between Bhamo and the new road could only be driven on during fine weather. In addition, there was the original cargo route from Bhamo to Tengyue. Recently, an agreement was reached with the Chinese government to jointly operate aviation services between Burma and Kunming, and preparations for the opening of this service were underway.</p>
<h3>Matters Involving Hainan Island</h3>
<p>Gibson, a member of the Labor Party, continued to ask whether, in view of the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island, this transport route had lost its strategic and possible commercial importance, and asked whether the British government had any plans to increase the current transport facilities. Moore asked to defer his reply briefly. Finally, a certain member of the Conservative Party asked whether the influx of Chinese into Burma along these routes had caused concern among the people of Burma. Moorehead replied that he had heard nothing about it. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>Italian Foreign Minister Receives Japanese Ambassador, Discusses Far East Situation</h3>
<p>(Rome) Toshiro Shiratori, the Japanese ambassador to Italy, met with Italian Foreign Minister Ciano here today. It is believed that the issue discussed was the reaction to the Japanese occupation of Hainan Island. No official announcement was made after the meeting. However, it is generally understood that France's request for Japan to explain the occupation of Hainan Island was also discussed. (Associated Press, 13th) (Paris) "Le Matin" recently published a dispatch from a Rome correspondent stating that Italian Foreign Minister Ciano had met with Japanese Ambassador Shiratori for a long time yesterday. This matter must have political significance. As the Japanese House of Representatives recently held a meeting, a certain member firmly advocated that Japan, Germany, and Italy should sign a military alliance treaty to strengthen the anti-communist cause. Minister Ciano met with Ambassador Shiratori at this time, which suggests that the content of the talks was quite important. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>French Authorities Refute Japanese Rumors, Deny Aviators Coming to China</h3>
<p>(Paris) News from Tokyo claimed that 49 French aviators had asked Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese ambassador to France, to go to China to help China reorganize its air force, and that 34 of them had arrived in China after being assembled by French Aviation Minister Gute Mag. The remaining 15 were scheduled to travel to the Far East by ship from Marseille on Friday. Today, the French authorities have officially denied this claim. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

<h3>Western Government Encourages People to Fight for Independence and Freedom: Do Not Betray: Do Not Be Ungrateful: Do Not Infight, Look to Foreign Countries to Avoid the Disaster of Destruction</h3>
<p>(Paris) News received here states that the Spanish government once again gave a speech yesterday, calling on the people within the government army's territory to join the government army under the slogan of "live or die," to fight for the freedom of the Spanish Republican government, to defend the land that has not been captured, and to fight until Spain achieves independence and freedom. It hoped to continue the decisive battle of the National Army that defended Madrid in November 1936, and to promote the spirit of awakened Spaniards. It hoped that all the people would unite as one, do not betray the country, do not be ungrateful, do not infight, otherwise they would be committing suicide, and they would be courting their own destruction. As long as everyone can abide by this righteousness, the Republican government will be able to accomplish its great and glorious cause. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>Madrid: The Spanish Republican government authorities yesterday distributed various kinds of slogans and leaflets in all districts of the city, calling on the people under government rule to persevere and fight to the end. Factories are working overtime, and workers are generally working twelve hours. Wounded soldiers are re-examined, and those who have fully recovered return to the front lines, while the disabled work in factories. Military experts are actively inspecting defense organizations and strengthening fortifications. Madrid Military Governor Cabellera is purging "unstable elements" from the military police, and 172 people have been dismissed and investigated. (Haitong News Agency, 14th) Madrid: According to an official report published by the Spanish government army today, there has been little change in the war situation on all fronts. The enemy army bombarded Madrid all day yesterday, firing more than 600 shells. In addition, the ports of Alicante and Cartagena were bombed by the Nationalist air force, causing great damage. One enemy plane was shot down. (Haitong News Agency, 14th)</p>
<h3>Western Nationalist Authorities Reject Peace Terms; Promulgate New Law Defining Political Responsibility, Aiming to Prevent Revenge</h3>
<p>(London) The three peace terms proposed by the Prime Minister of the Spanish Republican Government, Negrín, namely (1) preservation of Spain's independence and territorial integrity, (2) amnesty for political prisoners, and (3) holding a referendum, were relayed by the French government and then passed to the British government. The British government has agreed to forward them to the Spanish Nationalist government. However, Generals Franco has publicly rejected the second and third terms, making it unlikely that he will change his attitude. Nevertheless, the British side still hopes that the Spanish issue can be resolved as soon as possible. The British government is in close contact with the French government and is also in contact with the U.S. government. (Havas dispatch on the 12th)</p>
<p>Burgos: General Franco has ordered the announcement of a new law, stating that this law aims to harmonize the interests of all aspects of the nation and embraces the desire not to disrupt the economic lives of individuals. Economic punishments will be as light as possible, with attention paid to avoiding the ruin of small businesses. The punishment for criminals may be followed by expulsion from their hometowns, and in major cases, their Spanish nationality will be revoked. A total of eighty-nine articles list the crimes deemed punishable. However, it is stated that great care will be taken when implementing punishments, which include the confiscation of all or part of their property, imprisonment, and fines. Imprisonment ranges from two months to fifteen years, depending on the severity of the case. It is also stated that the term "politically responsible" will be applied to those who have helped to disrupt the order of Spain from October 1, 1934, to July 18, 1936, and to those who have opposed the Nationalist government with concrete actions or serious passivity since then. All parties and groups that formed the Popular Front after the February 1936 elections will be deemed illegal and will lose all rights and property. The property of these individuals will belong to the state. Members of parties and groups who joined unions as workers will not be punished, provided that the union members disaffiliated or were expelled from the union before July 18, 1936. Punishments include expulsion from Spain and exile to North African colonies for a period of six months to fifteen years. It is claimed that the main purpose of this law is to prevent revenge.

<h3>Legal Recognition Issue: Britain and France Consider Carefully; French Cabinet Reaches No Decision; The Two Countries Maintain Close Contact</h3>
<p>(Paris) The cabinet held a state council meeting this morning, which lasted for three and a half hours. The main topic of discussion was the international situation. According to general knowledge, the state council did not make any decisions regarding the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government as the legal government. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government as the legitimate government, Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax are expected to ask the Cabinet at tomorrow's meeting for an extension of their authority to act, so that they can grant recognition at an appropriate time without further Cabinet approval. Although the opposition Labour Party in Parliament has expressed opposition to this approach, it is unlikely to be a major concern due to the support of the majority of parliamentarians for the government. It is still difficult to predict when recognition will be implemented, but it generally depends on the following: (1) the attitude adopted by the French cabinet, (2) the outcome of the efforts to persuade the Spanish Republican government to stop fighting, (3) the outcome of the efforts to persuade the Spanish Nationalist government to grant amnesty to members of the Republican government, and (4) the success of Britain's efforts to control the territories controlled by the Spanish Nationalist government economically. Regarding the last point, Britain believes that it is necessary to immediately confront any challenge. According to the talks held yesterday between the British ambassador to Italy and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano, the news that Italy intends to establish a "Mediterranean Company" in Spain has been confirmed. Although the company is ostensibly engaged in building bridges and canals, it actually intends to retain a "vanguard" in Spain to replace volunteers. Therefore, London is paying close attention to the establishment of this company. (Havas dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) "Chronicle News" diplomatic correspondent Bartley published an article today discussing the issue of British and French recognition of the Franco government, stating that it was widely rumored last week that the British and French governments would formally announce the legal recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government on Monday or Tuesday of this week. In fact, London and Paris have not yet reached a decision on this matter. Bartley stated that Britain and France are well aware of the Nationalist government's eagerness for Britain and France to legally recognize it, and they are also inclined to take this step. However, the biggest obstacle is that the Spanish government in Madrid is still insisting on fighting to the end, which is forcing Britain and France to consider the matter carefully. It is widely believed that Britain will allow France to take the lead on this matter and will make a decision after the French cabinet discusses the matter at its meeting today. (Haitong dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(London) Speaker of the House of Commons FitzRoy today refused to allow Labour MP Henderson to propose a motion for adjournment. According to Henderson, his motion for adjournment was intended to draw the attention of the entire House to the government's refusal to give assurances on the Spanish issue, namely that the British government would not recognize the rebels as the de facto or de jure government of Spain as long as the existing legitimate government of Spain exists. (Reuters dispatch on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The possibility of France recognizing the Franco Nationalist government in some way is now being discussed by various newspapers. Although there seems to be a consensus that this move is appropriate, the proposed methods of recognition are not entirely the same. Some, such as the Paris Daily, argue that there is no longer any reason to refuse legal recognition. Others, such as the Petit Parisien, argue that this move is legally and morally problematic, so the British and French governments should proceed with extreme caution. The Petit Parisien advises the French cabinet to act in concert with Britain. The issue of French recognition of the Spanish Nationalist government is currently awaiting a decision by the cabinet meeting. (Reuters dispatch on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The issue of recognizing the Spanish Nationalist government is currently under discussion between the British and French governments. News has been spread in the capital of a certain European country that the United States will also participate in the discussions. Upon hearing this, political figures expressed surprise, because the U.S. government has not considered this and does not intend to negotiate with the Spanish Nationalist government. The traditional policy of the United States is that no matter what country experiences a revolution, it must wait until the rebels are able to control the entire country before recognizing them as a belligerent party. Furthermore, it must wait until the country has restored peace, the government organized by the rebels has established an agreement with the U.S. government to resolve the issue of compensation for damages suffered by Americans during the revolution, and provides assurances of fair treatment for the interests held by Americans before recognizing it as the legitimate government. This policy has not changed. If this policy were to be changed because of the Spanish issue, it would have serious implications if a revolution were to occur on the American continent in the future. Therefore, it is not something the United States would be happy to do. Political figures also stated that Brazilian Foreign Minister Aranha and U.S. authorities have been meeting for days, and the issue of totalitarian countries invading Latin America is discussed every day. Under these circumstances, how could the United States readily grant allies of the totalitarian countries (i.e., the Spanish Nationalist government) any convenience to boost the power of those countries?

<h3>British House of Commons Discusses Spanish Incident; Prime Minister Explains Cruiser's Trip to Minorca; Opposition MPs Shout "Shameful" in Unison; British Ambassador Visits Italian Foreign Minister</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the British cruiser "Devonshire's" trip to Minorca Island on the 9th of this month, Prime Minister Chamberlain recently delivered a speech in the House of Commons, explaining the situation: "At the request of the Nationalist authorities of Spanish Majorca Island, the British government dispatched the "Devonshire" to transport the Nationalist commander of the island to Minorca Island to discuss a peaceful takeover. Prior notice had been received that if the Nationalists lacked transportation and were unable to negotiate with the authorities on Minorca Island, they would launch an attack. We therefore provided our warship for Nationalist officers to travel on, so that they could contact the authorities on Minorca Island, thereby avoiding unnecessary bloodshed. (Applause from the MPs) Therefore, it was decided that the "Devonshire" would undertake this task. The government did not consult the Spanish Republican government or the Nationalist government on this matter, but it is a fact that the Nationalist authorities on Majorca Island kept in contact with Nationalist Commander-in-Chief General Franco. The French government was fully aware of our actions and expressed its approval. The "Devonshire" sailed to Minorca Island on the 9th of this month, and the Nationalist representatives immediately began negotiations with the government forces on the island. As a result, Minorca Island was peacefully taken over by the Nationalist authorities. British government personnel did not participate in the negotiations and are therefore not responsible for anything." The "Devonshire" also transported 450 refugees from Minorca Island to Marseille, France. At this point, Opposition Labour MP Henderson asked, "When the "Devonshire" was anchored off the coast of Minorca Island, many planes flown by Italians bombed the island six times. Is the government prepared to make representations to the Italian government?" The Prime Minister replied, "No, the government does not intend to make representations to the Italian government." The Prime Minister then read a telegram from the British consul in Palma, Majorca Island, stating that "The Nationalist naval commander of Majorca Island solemnly declared that the bombing of Minorca Island was due to pilots disobeying orders. He was very sorry and promised to issue a written apology." Finally, the Prime Minister said that we did not consult the Spanish Republican government on this matter for two reasons: first, the matter was urgent; and second, "the departments of the Spanish Republican government are scattered everywhere, and it is very difficult to find responsible personnel in a short time." (Some Conservative MPs laughed upon hearing this, while Opposition MPs shouted "Shameful"). (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) British Ambassador Lord Perth visited Foreign Minister Ciano this afternoon to discuss the Spanish issue, including the bombing of Minorca Island by Italian aircraft when representatives of the government forces on the Spanish island of Minorca were discussing a peaceful takeover with representatives of the Nationalist forces on the British cruiser "Devonshire". It is rumored that Spanish Nationalist Commander-in-Chief Franco expressed his dissatisfaction to the Italian government on this matter, but this has not been confirmed.

<h3>Germany's New Battleship Named "Bismarck"; Launch Ceremony Held Yesterday; Hitler Delivers Speech</h3>
<p>Port of Hamburg, Germany: The launch ceremony for the first 35,000-ton battleship built by the German government was held at 1:00 PM today. The ceremony was presided over by Ms. Lowenwitt, the granddaughter of the late Iron Chancellor Bismarck. In front of a crowd of 50,000 people, Ms. Lowenwitt shouted, "I, on behalf of the Führer, name this ship the "Bismarck!" The attendees of the ceremony, led by Führer Hitler, included Aviation Minister General Göring, Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces General Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Raeder, Chief of the Political Police Himmler, and many other key figures of the Nazi Party. The Führer delivered a short speech in public, stating that Germany needed to revitalize its military to protect its survival and safeguard its national interests. This was not only true for the army and air force, but also for the navy. The country has recently launched two 26,000-ton battleships, and "today another 35,000-ton battleship is declared complete." Finally, the Führer praised the achievements of the late Prime Minister Bismarck. Next, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Admiral Raeder spoke, expressing his gratitude to the Führer for strengthening the German navy. The "Bismarck" was then launched at 1:18 PM.

<h3>Germany and Italy Establish Commercial Agreement to Promote Trade Relations</h3>

<h3>Mussolini Will Deliver Speech; Reiterate Land Claims</h3>
<p>(Rome) Foreign sources announced today that Mussolini plans to deliver a speech on February 19 to state Italy's will to the world. He believes that Italy's position in the Mediterranean and North Africa has been strengthened due to the victory of the Spanish Nationalist forces and may announce three reasons for demanding land concessions from France: (1) Mussolini may point out that Italy's population is too large, so it has no choice but to demand France cede Tunis to benefit the Italian people; (2) in view of the current status of the Italian Empire, Italy really needs to participate in the administrative power of the Suez Canal; (3) The third point concerns Gibraltar. Mussolini will say that Gibraltar is a geographically legitimate part of Italian East Africa. (Associated Press dispatch on the 13th)</p>

<h3>Poland's Sea Outlet; Fortifications to be Built on Åland Islands; Britain Replies to Finland and Sweden, Expressing Approval in Principle</h3>
<p>(London) Reuters has learned that Britain recently replied to a note from Sweden and Finland, stating that Britain, in principle, agrees to the two countries building defense works on a portion of the Åland Islands. The Åland Islands originally belonged to Sweden, but were seized by Russia in 1809. In 1854, they were occupied by the Allies. During World War I, Germany used them as a naval base. In 1919, the islands were neutralized, and all of the batteries were destroyed. In the same year, a public vote was held in favor of autonomy, but they have now become part of the Republic of Finland. The archipelago is composed of about 300 small islands, covering an area of ​​557 square miles, and is located at the entrance to the Gulf of Bothnia. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<h3>"Arhat Buddha Statues" and "Bronze Clepsydra" Stolen from Guangzhou and Shipped to Japan; Japanese Army Recklessly Issues Mimeographed Military Notes</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: More than three months have passed since Guangzhou fell into the hands of the Japanese army, but the city's situation remains quiet. Most merchants have gone bankrupt after the scorched-earth policy. Not only are they unable to resume their old businesses, but they also dare not make a living under the threat of robbery and murder. Since the Japanese army occupied the urban area, they have blockaded the Pearl River waterway, prohibiting foreign merchant ships from sailing. This has allowed them to take control of the commercial interests of Britain, France, and the United States in South China, so the goods of Britain, the United States, and France have been cut off from being transported to Guangzhou for several months. Foreign merchants in Hong Kong and Vietnam have suffered unknown losses, and foreign goods in Guangzhou's interior have disappeared as a result. Even if there are old goods, they are dozens of times more expensive. Small industries that rely on foreign raw materials have been completely shut down due to the interruption of supply. The Japanese have succeeded in their blockade policy, and recently they have been shipping large quantities of Japanese goods to be wholesaled to traitorous merchants. All cotton textiles, daily necessities, and even red pill opium are shipped by Japanese merchants. After absorbing the money from the interior, they load it up and take it away if it is gold, silver, or hard currency. In all areas where the Japanese army has arrived, such as Nanhai, Panyu, Sanshui, and Shunde counties, in addition to searching for food, they must also seize the gold and silver hidden by the villagers. Any slightly valuable antiques are also transported overseas. The Hualin Temple in Guangzhou, the first place where Buddhism came to the west, is one of the four major monasteries. It is the only ancient site that remains. The Arhat Buddha statues enshrined in the temple are not only ancient and gilded, but their sculptural art has long been admired by foreigners. This time, when the Japanese army entered the city, they coveted them. Until recently, they were finally stolen. Also, the ancient "Bronze Clepsydra" bronze ware displayed in Hanmin Park has also fallen into the hands of the Japanese. The Japanese army's entry into Guangzhou has not only plundered jewels and women, but also left no fragments of the historical relics of the Cantonese people. The Japanese in Guangzhou have no taxes to collect, so they are forced to issue a kind of military note. Most of the notes are ten cents in value. The handwriting on the notes is mimeographed with a steel pen plate, and the paper is the kind of paper used for newspapers. Since they do not resemble banknotes in form, they can naturally be made crudely and issued recklessly. Therefore, when they are issued to the market, the citizens refuse to use them. However, the Japanese military authorities rely on high pressure to force people to use them at full value. At first, they set a high value, stipulating that every ten cents of Japanese military notes was worth three yuan in Chinese currency. Later, because they could not circulate, they gradually lowered the value. Currently, they are only exchanged at par with Chinese silver dollars, but the people still refuse to use them. Even if they are forced to use them, they dare not keep them. Therefore, the Japanese scheme of an empty check policy has never been successful. Wherever the Japanese army goes, in addition to searching for food and women, cigarettes are also a welcome item for the older generation. However, since Guangzhou fell, the source of cigarettes has been cut off. Only the old Sword brand cigarettes stored in the warehouses of the British-American Tobacco Company are available on the market, but the value is expensive, rising to five yuan per box. The Japanese army competes to buy them without hesitating. If they have Chinese silver dollar notes in their pockets, they give them. Otherwise, they take a box of cigarettes with fifty cents of military notes. The cigarette vendors send them off with angry eyes, sighing at their bad luck. After this lesson, the cigarette vendors no longer display whole boxes of cigarettes outside, but only release small packets to prevent the Japanese army from patronizing them with military notes and causing too much loss.</p>
<h3>Gu Zhutong Convenes County Magistrate Meeting in Deqing</h3>

After the meeting, Commander Gu and Commander-in-Chief Zhu returned to their respective defense positions due to the importance of the military situation at the front. The local guerrilla forces have been reorganized and equipped, and military equipment and ammunition have also been adequately distributed.</p>
<h3>The Fujian Authorities Strictly Prohibit Gambling, Arresting Over 150 Offenders, Confiscating Over 1,000 Sets of Mahjong Tiles to be Burned on a Designated Date</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Dispatch: Before the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War in Fujian, Taiwanese people flocked to the area, primarily engaging in opening gambling dens and opium dens. The most prevalent forms of gambling were flower clubs, pai gow, and fan-tan. However, with the outbreak of the Shanghai Battle in late August of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), Japanese and Taiwanese people residing in Fujian retreated along with the war. The practices of opium smoking and gambling also ceased, and society regained its purity. Unexpectedly, trading companies and hotels operated under foreign names have emerged, engaging in opium smoking, gambling, and prostitution. The hotel opened by foreign businessmen, named "Fa Da," is located in Tai Jiang. The trading company, named "Sheng He," is located in Da Ling Ding. The owner, Liu Heqing, is a Chinese person who has acquired foreign nationality. Fa Da's convenient transportation and spacious facilities have made its business the most prosperous, with gamblers primarily being upper and middle-class individuals and wealthy merchants. The most common form of gambling is mahjong, with over thirty to forty tables operating daily, and wins and losses amounting to hundreds of yuan. The hotel's daily income is no less than one thousand yuan. Chen Yi, the Chairman of the Provincial Government, believes that during this period, the lives of people in the rear should be more serious, and such absurd behavior is inappropriate. He ordered the military police to crack down on these activities. The Fa Da Hotel and Sheng He Trading Company were raided one after another, and over 150 people involved in opium smoking and gambling were arrested and detained at the police station for questioning. After investigations, over forty people were released on bail due to insufficient evidence. The remaining fifty or so, whose offenses were lighter, were sentenced to fifteen days of detention or a fine of fifteen yuan. Over sixty others were sent to the local court for trial. On the sixth of this month, the local prosecutor's office conducted the first preliminary investigation. After questioning, they were released on bail pending further disposition. Both Fa Da and Sheng He were ordered to close down. Currently, the provincial authorities are determined to eradicate gambling and issued two announcements on the seventh. One announcement was directed at public officials, stating that gambling wastes time and disrupts work, causing great harm to society. It has been strictly prohibited, and the Chairman has repeatedly warned against it. Therefore, everyone should be vigilant. Recent reports indicate that gambling activities still occur in various places, which is deeply regrettable. If strict prohibitions are not enforced, how can we eliminate bad habits and reverse the declining moral standards? The county magistrates are hereby ordered to ensure that their subordinates strictly investigate and crack down on such activities. Any public officials who do not value themselves and violate the prohibition will be severely punished upon discovery, without any leniency. The other announcement prohibits the private prediction of flower clubs, stating that flower clubs are extremely harmful, not only serving as a medium for communication with bandits but also leading to the ruin of families and even the loss of lives. Recent investigations have revealed that the practice of predicting flower clubs is rampant in the northwestern counties of Fujian. Therefore, the prohibition is reiterated, and the practice is strictly forbidden. If any local government officials in the counties are found to be condoning or shielding such activities, they will be subject to the death penalty according to military law upon verification. The public is hereby notified. At the same time, the Investigation Office of the Finance Department also seized over 1,500 sets of mahjong tiles for rent from various grocery stores in Fuzhou, planning to burn them publicly on a designated date. The number of people playing mahjong in the private sector has also significantly decreased, reaching a state of near silence.</p>
<h3>Nantong County Magistrate Peng Removed from Post for Thorough Investigation; New County Magistrate Wu Chunke Takes Office</h3>
<p>Nantong Dispatch: There have been no significant military developments in the three counties of Nantong, Hai'an, and Qidong recently. However, the Chinese army is internally preparing for war and making all necessary preparations. It is expected that there will be unexpected victories in the next two months. Since the three victories in Sanyu Town, after the Japanese army suffered setbacks, the Chinese army has gained the trust of the people. Recently, the provincial government appointed Wu Chunke as the Special Commissioner of the Fourth District and concurrently the magistrate of Nantong. Wu was originally the magistrate of Guanyun County and has contributed to the war effort. This appointment is a reward for his merits and it is expected that he will achieve something. Peng Longxiang, the former magistrate, is a native of this county. Since taking office, he has been loyal to his duties. Last year, when he served as the commander of the four counties of Tongzhou, Chongming, Hai'an, and Qidong, he led the troops of the four counties in besieging the Japanese army in Tongzhou, achieving notable victories and maintaining local order. He was highly regarded by the people. Later, he resigned from the post of commander and served solely as the county magistrate. Due to various reasons, his attitude became passive, and he repeatedly resigned but was not allowed to do so. Last month, he came to Shanghai on official business to raise funds and purchase ammunition. Upon his return to duty, he attended an important meeting at Beixing Bridge. Brigade Commander Zhang Yi presented a provincial order stating "ineffective in the war effort, detained for investigation." Peng was immediately escorted to Jiangyan and sent to the province for thorough investigation. It is said that Peng's misfortune was not only due to his ineffective war effort in the past six months but also due to his improper use of personnel.</p>
<h3>Fierce Battle Between Chinese and Japanese Armies on Taihu Lake</h3>
<p>Wuxi Dispatch: At around 7 PM on the tenth, over 400 members of the Chinese guerrilla force under Commander Lin, divided into over 100 speedboats, planned to land at Fenshui Dun and launch a surprise attack on Caoqiao to cut off the Japanese army's retreat from Heqiao. Unexpectedly, due to the ongoing battles in Changxing and Yixing by the Japanese forces, the Japanese were deeply concerned that the guerrilla forces on Taihu Lake might take advantage of the situation. Therefore, in recent days, they have been dispatching troops on speedboats along the Xiyi Road shoreline to patrol day and night. When Commander Lin's hundred or so speedboats had just passed Mashan and were approaching Fenshui Dun, they were spotted by the Japanese patrolling soldiers. Immediately, machine gun fire erupted, and the Japanese soldiers continuously fired signal flares. In less than half an hour, three to ten small Japanese speedboats suddenly arrived. Commander Lin, seeing that they were prepared, immediately ordered the boats to scatter and hide in the harbor. An hour later, the Japanese assumed that the guerrilla forces had retreated and were about to return to the port when the Chinese commander gave the order. Over a hundred speedboats shot out like arrows, and gunfire concentrated on the Japanese boats. The Japanese army, caught off guard, quickly retaliated. Thus, a fierce battle unfolded on the lake. It was vaguely seen that seven or eight Japanese speedboats were hit and sank, with Japanese soldiers falling into the water. Two boats were set on fire by Chinese sulfur guns and burned on the lake. After three hours of fighting, two Japanese shallow-water warships suddenly arrived. Commander Lin, knowing that the Japanese navy had come to their aid, ordered a retreat.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Hotel Owner Demonstrates Great Righteousness</h3>
<p>Wuxi Dispatch: There is a man named Cui Bingsheng, whose nationality is unclear, said to be either Korean or Taiwanese, in his forties. Because one of his feet is lame, people call him Cui Cripple. He has a special relationship with Sergeant Dong Hailin of the Japanese military police and acts as a secret agent for the Japanese military police. This agent has committed many evils on a daily basis, falsely accusing good people of being bandits. Whenever he finds out that someone has a little wealth, he accuses them of being guerrillas, extorting money before releasing them. According to statistics by local residents, Cui Bingsheng and Dong Hailin now own hundreds of thousands of assets. Therefore, the people of the county all wish to get rid of Cui Bingsheng and his gang. However, heaven's justice prevails. On the afternoon of the twelfth, Cui was abducted to the countryside by guerrillas. The reason is that Cui has a friend named Gu, who is the owner of a certain hotel in the county. He usually has contact with Cui. On the afternoon of the twelfth, Gu suddenly said to Cui, "A relative of mine has been wrongly arrested. Please come with me to rescue him. If he can be released, his family is willing to give two thousand yuan as a reward." Cui had known Gu for a long time and did not suspect anything, so he immediately went with Gu. Unexpectedly, just as they reached the intersection of Zhoushanbang and Xihu Highway, more than ten brave men suddenly appeared, each holding a handgun, and took him away. Cui immediately said, "You and I are old friends. You want money, I'll give you money. You want guns, I'll give you guns." Gu laughed and said to Cui, "I don't want money, I don't want guns, I just want your person." Then, without saying a word, they took Cui towards Dongting. It happened that Cui's cronies witnessed Cui being abducted, but they did not dare to come forward to rescue him and immediately reported it to the Japanese military police by telephone. Troops were dispatched to the area, but Cui and the guerrillas had disappeared. The hotel has been sealed off because of this incident. The employees of the hotel have already fled, so no one has been arrested. Gu can be said to be hateful of evil and filled with great righteousness.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Guerrillas Attack Japanese Army</h3>
<p>Wuxi Dispatch: Xia Jiashi, the head of the Jiangyin puppet police station, in order to prevent the activities of the guerrillas, sent Gao Xueqin to be stationed in the northern town of the county to gather information. Yuan Yacheng, the leader of the nearby guerrillas, learned of this and led his troops to Zhouzhuang at around 1 PM on the fourth to launch a fierce attack. The Japanese army in the area, seeing the guerrillas coming fiercely, retreated to the Great Buddha Hall near the town. At around 11 PM, the guerrillas threw grenades into the temple, a total of more than thirty. More than twenty Japanese soldiers were killed. At 7 AM the next morning, both sides retreated.</p>
<p>Letter: I have read the report in your newspaper on February 14, "The Puppet Show in Fengxian Takes the Stage," which states, "The puppet county magistrate of Fengxian is filled by Qian Chao, the former staff officer of the First Pacification Headquarters." This happens to be the same name as mine. I am originally from Hangzhou. Except for medical practice, I have never held a position in the military or political circles. I am currently practicing medicine in Shanghai. The Qian mentioned above must be someone else. I am afraid of confusion and misunderstanding, so I hereby declare this. Please publish this letter in your newspaper. I am grateful. Sincerely, Qian Chao, Doctor.</p>
<h3>Hainan Island and French Interests in the Far East</h3>
<p>— Translated by Bu San</p>
<p>(Translated from Tian Boli's original work in the 108th issue of the "Chinese National Hardship Magazine" published in Shanghai) (2)</p>
<p>Since 1932, France's attitude towards the Far East has changed. Previously, France strongly opposed the Chinese National Government's proposal to abolish consular jurisdiction and the special rights enjoyed by foreigners and expressed concern about the development of communism in China. At this time, Japan portrayed itself as a defender against the "Red Peril" and protector of foreign interests. France's change of attitude towards the Chinese National Government was due to the National Government's opposition to communism. Furthermore, Japan's attack on China not only threatened France's interests in China but also made France's territories in the Far East feel endangered, which France cannot forget.</p>
<p>France's largest territory in the Far East is undoubtedly Annam, which is unquestionable. Annam and North Africa are France's two most important colonies. First, because Annam has a large population and abundant resources, it is France's third-largest source of raw materials. Second, because Annam is France's vast investment area and commodity market.</p>
<p>From a strategic point of view, Annam is even more important to France for the following reasons: (1) China and Annam share a common border of about 1,600 kilometers, so France cannot but pay direct attention to events in China. (2) Saigon is an important stopover port for French shipping to and from the Far East. (3) Hanoi has become the terminus of the Sino-French commercial aviation route. (4) France plans to build Cam Ranh Bay (Baic de Camranh) into a French naval base in the Far East. It is a natural harbor, just like San Francisco in the United States. During the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, the Russian expeditionary fleet composed of 145 warships was concentrated in this bay. The bay is located midway between Hong Kong and Singapore, 1,200 kilometers away from Manila and the East Indies. (5) Annam is one of France's land routes into China, and its passage is Yunnan, so its importance is increasing day by day.</p>
<p>The facts of recent months have particularly enhanced the status of Annam. Annam and Hong Kong are bound to become the only routes for the shipment of arms into China, but all arms shipped from Annam into Yunnan must first obtain the permission of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Colonies before they can pass. Although the French government has not formally announced an arms embargo to China, it decided last October that only arms purchased before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War or loaded before October 12, 1937, could be shipped from Annam into Yunnan. Despite this, Japan accused France of continuously shipping arms into China, and China accused France of improperly hindering the free shipment of arms into China, which seemed to be France's indirect assistance to Japan. Regarding this issue, it seems that only the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs can understand the truth, and the outside world cannot know.</p>
<p>France also maintains and controls a Guangzhou Bay leased territory in southern China, which covers an area of 800 square kilometers and has a population of 250,000. The land was leased by France in 1898, at the same time as the British leased Weihaiwei, and Germany also leased Jiaozhou Bay in the same year. Guangzhou Bay is very close to Hainan Island, but if Hainan Island is occupied by Japan, Guangzhou Bay will reduce its strategic importance, which is a very likely possibility. Although foreign goods can be transported from Guangzhou Bay into the interior, commercial exchanges in the area are not very important.</p>
<p>Within France's sphere of influence in the Far East, there are two particularly important areas: the Xisha Islands and Hainan Island. The Xisha Islands are a group of small islands located east of Annam and southwest of Hainan Island. France said that according to historical records, the Xisha Islands have long been occupied by the Annam government, so they should belong to France, which China of course denies. Recently, Japan also said that since 1920, Japanese people have continuously mined phosphate rock in the islands, so they should belong to Japan. While the two sides were arguing, France sent troops to land and occupy the islands. The apparent reason was to protect French industries, but in reality, it was to prevent Japanese troops from landing and to prevent the Japanese from using the islands to intensify the blockade of the Chinese coast. Although the value of the islands as a naval base is highly debatable, they are strategically very important to Annam. Because if the islands are occupied by an enemy of France, Annam will be greatly threatened. According to naval experts, as long as a team of submarines is stationed on the islands, the regular traffic between Annam's ports and the outside world can be cut off. Regarding the economic value of the Xisha Islands, opinions vary. It is said that the islands contain enough phosphate to supply Annam for twenty years.</p>
<p>Hainan Island is much more important than the Xisha Islands. The island is located east of Annam, and its position is sufficient to directly control Tokyo, which is strategically vital. Therefore, some people criticize France for not occupying the island at the same time as Annam, which was France's mistake. In the Sino-French Treaty of 1898, China promised not to cede Hainan Island to any third country without France's consent.</p>
<p>Under the current circumstances, if Japan wants to occupy Hainan Island, it will be difficult for China to prevent it. France cannot prevent Japan from occupying the island alone without foreign aid. The island is located midway between the naval bases of Hong Kong and Singapore, so the United Kingdom is also very concerned about the fate of the island. Therefore, when France needs foreign aid for the Hainan Island issue, such aid is likely to come from the United Kingdom. No matter which country installs submarines and seaplanes on Hainan Island, it can threaten the safety of traffic between Hong Kong and Singapore.</p>
<p>The importance of Hainan Island to Japan is not only because the island can be used as a base for Japan to attack the southern provinces of China, but also because the island can be used as a hub for Japanese merchant ships: for example, Japanese merchant ships sailing to Australia, the South Sea, India, and Europe must pass through the island. Regarding this issue, a Japanese writer once said that Japan's occupation of Hainan Island, on the one hand, can cut off the connection between Hong Kong and Singapore to reduce British influence in the Far East; on the other hand, Japan can use this to open up a new route to the south.</p>
<p>Since China realized the strategic importance of Hainan Island, it has recently been developing the island's natural resources, such as planting oak trees, coffee, cotton, yu jina frost, tobacco, and other tropical plants. In early 1937, representatives of government agencies and representatives of the financial or business community estimated the island's resources, studied business possibilities, and promoted planting and railway construction. Originally, railway construction had begun, but unfortunately, the Sino-Japanese War broke out, and it was stopped in August 1937.</p>
<p>From the above, China, the United Kingdom, Japan, and France all pay close attention to this Hainan Island, and it is natural that the island will become a powder keg threatening the Pacific in the future. In mid-June 1938, the Japanese Foreign Minister solemnly declared that Japan had no intention of occupying Hainan Island; but three days later, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated: "If it is necessary in the struggle to overthrow the National Government, Japan can occupy Hainan Island." A little later, Japan announced that "Chinese troops stationed on Hainan Island threatened Japanese warships operating off the coast of South China," and Hainan Island was heavily bombed by Japanese aircraft and warships. As a result, the United Kingdom and France jointly presented a note to Japan, urging Japan not to invade Hainan Island, and if the situation became serious, the United Kingdom and France would take joint action against Japan. This declaration by the United Kingdom and France can make people believe that the United Kingdom and France are likely to sign a naval agreement in the Pacific. Behind these, the United Kingdom and France can be said to have cooperated politically, on the one hand because of the Far East issue, and on the other hand because of the formation of an anti-communist group. Japan must also pay attention to the European situation for the sake of anti-communism.</p>
<p>Whether in the Pacific, or in the Mediterranean and Central Europe, the interests of the United Kingdom and France are the same. France must protect its territories in the Far East, just like the United Kingdom, the only difference is that France's naval power is insufficient to complete this goal. Whether on the coast of Annam or in Chinese territorial waters, France's fleet is very scattered and relatively weak in strength. However, France has a large number of colonial troops in Annam, and the military equipment is also very complete. If Japan attacks Annam, France can still fight against it, but the outcome is mostly pessimistic.</p>
<p>Far-sighted people in France are very afraid that Japan will follow its expansion policy to attack Annam, especially since the theory of "Asia for Asians" proposed by the Japanese is developing very quickly. The former Japanese Minister of the Interior, Minei, and other officials have promoted the liberation of colored people from white people, which has caused great concern in France, especially because Japan is developing its power in Siam. Recently, Japanese newspapers have launched a major attack on France, which may also prompt France to cooperate with the United Kingdom to save their interests in the Far East. (End)</p>

<h3>The Ministry Approves the Transportation of Five Kinds of Native Products from Zhejiang Province to Shanghai; the Yong Sheng Vessel Joins the Shanghai-Wenzhou-Taiwan Line to Load Goods; the Mou Fu Vessel Sails to Ningbo Today and Enters the Dock for Repairs After the Shift</h3>
<p>According to shipping industry news, regarding the case of 54 kinds of native products from Zhejiang Province being prohibited from being transported to Shanghai, after various industries sent telegrams requesting relief, the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the transportation of five kinds of native products, such as cotton paper, to Shanghai. Ning Shao Company recently chartered the British Yong Sheng vessel, scheduled to sail on the Shanghai-Taiwan-Wenzhou line the day after tomorrow to load goods. Li He Foreign Firm's Mou Fu vessel sails to Ningbo today and will enter the dock for annual repairs after returning to Shanghai after the shift. Tang Sai, Mei Da, and other vessels will temporarily suspend sailing during the first few days of the lunar new year. The reporter of Modern Society has investigated and reported the following details:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Economic Affairs Has Approved the Transportation of Cotton and Tea to Shanghai: The Ministry of Economic Affairs previously prohibited the transportation of native products from Zhejiang Province to Shanghai because Shanghai was also regarded as a region controlled by Japanese violence, in order to prevent domestic goods from being transported to occupied areas. Various industries argued that since the end of the year is approaching, if exports are banned, it will have a significant impact on rural finance and the interests of merchants. Moreover, the Shanghai International Settlement is not under violent control, so they sent telegrams requesting a temporary suspension of the ban. Yesterday, according to shipping industry news, the Ministry of Economic Affairs approved the temporary transportation of five kinds of native products, including cotton, cotton yarn, paper, tea, and eggs, to Shanghai before the Trade Commission and the Agricultural Bank raise funds to purchase them as a temporary measure. However, the chamber of commerce and related organizations must be responsible for providing proof. The Ningbo Chamber of Commerce has been notified by telegram. Currently, the Zhejiang Customs is waiting for the order from the Ministry of Finance before approving the export of the above native products.</p>
<p>Yong Sheng Sets Sail to Wenzhou and Taiwan to Load Goods: The British Yong Lu vessel, managed by the Tai Chang Foreign Firm in this city, was originally chartered by the American Weili Han Company and registered with the Tenth Army Group Command to sail on the Shanghai-Wenzhou-Taiwan line. Now that Weili Han has terminated the charter, Ning Shao Company has chartered the vessel and is scheduled to set sail the day after tomorrow to join the Shanghai-Taiwan-Wenzhou line and load goods. In addition, the Xin Anna vessel of Weili Han Company, which was approved to sail directly to Ningbo, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Due to some unresolved internal issues, it has not yet set sail as of yesterday. The Mou Fu to Undergo Scheduled Dock Repairs: The German Li He Foreign Firm's Mou Fu vessel has reduced its passenger ticket prices since it was approved to sail directly to Shanghai and Ningbo. Because the vessel's cabin facilities are clean and the service is attentive, it is extremely crowded with passengers and its business is thriving. The vessel will arrive in Shanghai from Ningbo this morning and will still sail directly to Ningbo at 4 PM this afternoon. After returning to Shanghai after the shift, it will no longer sail and will enter the dock for repairs on the eighteenth, to overhaul the machinery and paint the hull. It is scheduled to be completed in two weeks and will resume sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo route.</p>
<p>Tang Sai and Other Vessels Suspend Sailing for the New Year: The American Hua Mei Shipping Company's Tang Sai, Tang Lu, Tang Bei, and other vessels will temporarily suspend sailing during the first few days of the lunar new year to allow the Chinese crew members to celebrate the New Year. Tang Sai is scheduled to dock in Shanghai on the eighteenth, Tang Bei in Taiwan, and Tang Lu in Wenzhou, respectively, for the New Year and will resume sailing as usual on the twenty-second. Mei Li Company's Mei Da, Mei Fa, and other vessels will also temporarily suspend sailing. However, the German Ping, En De, Kang Sha Yi, Kai Li, and other vessels of the Zhong Yi Company will all sail as usual and will not stop their shifts to facilitate transportation.</p>
<h3>The Kai Bo Vessel's Bottom is Cracked, Making Salvage Difficult; the Chimney and Mast Exposed Above the Water are Stolen by Pirates</h3>
<p>The Panama merchant Kai Bo vessel, chartered by the Ning Shao Shipping Company last year, left Shanghai on the twenty-third of last month to load coal in 　and transfer to Ningbo. It ran aground near Haimen outside the Diaoban waters and sank. All sixty-nine crew members were rescued and arrived in Shanghai one after another. The vessel was insured for £15,000 with the British Royal Insurance Company. Therefore, the insurance company, in order to find a way to salvage the hull, requested the assistance of the Ma Le tugboat of the Lai Ci Foreign Firm on the eleventh of this month, accompanied by two Russians who are familiar with navigation and good at diving, to go to the sinking site for inspection. According to news from the shipping industry that the reporter of Modern Society has learned, the Russians arrived at the site of the Kai Bo vessel's accident on the morning of the fourteenth and immediately dived into the water to investigate the details. The detailed situation has not yet been reported, but according to the vessel's crew members, the vessel is too old (built 32 years ago), and the iron plates at the bottom of the vessel are mostly corroded. After running aground, the captain tried to reverse the vessel to avoid the danger, but the surrounding area is full of reefs, resulting in severe collisions and the bottom of the vessel is completely cracked. Moreover, the vessel is loaded with coal, making salvage extremely difficult. After the vessel sank, the chimney and mast that were originally exposed above the water were dismantled and stolen by nearby pirates.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Search Foreign Vessels in Dinghai Waters; the Zhong Yi Company's Ma Jiali Vessel Encounters a Japanese Warship and is Forced to Stop</h3>
<p>The Italian Zhong Yi Company's Ma Jiali vessel, with a gross tonnage of 120 tons, which originally sailed between Dinghai and Shenjiamen in eastern Zhejiang, encountered the Japanese warship No. 4 on its way from Shenjiamen to Dinghai. The Japanese warship signaled the vessel to stop. Three soldiers from the Japanese warship boarded the vessel by motorboat to inspect the cargo and passengers. After half an hour, the vessel was released. In addition, a sailboat passing through the area was shot at by the Japanese warship. Lao Dazhuang A Yu was injured and has been sent to the Shenjiamen Cunji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>False "Workers Welfare Association" Attempts to Restart Activities, Workers' Will Remains Steadfastly United in Refusal to Participate</h3>
<p>The Japanese puppets, previously aiming to manipulate the city's labor movement, hoping to bolster popular support for their own use, initiated the organization of the false "Chinese Workers Welfare Association" by the puppet "Social Bureau Chief" Hu Shouchang. They appointed a Japanese man, Kutada, as an instructor, and a Korean man, Lin Zixiong, as secretary-general, using the guise of aiding the unemployed to entice various labor unions to cooperate. However, the responsible members of each labor union, deeply understanding the situation, firmly refused to participate. Consequently, the association used money to confuse some idle elements, fabricating labor union names and engaging in empty performances and false dealings. When the Japanese military headquarters learned of this, they were quite displeased, so they immediately stopped issuing subsidies, causing the "association" to fall into a state of stagnation. It is now learned that the "association" has recently obtained funding from the puppet "Municipal Government," allocating 5,000 yuan per month for activity expenses. Therefore, Lin Zixiong is actively engaging in activities again, and the general idle elements are colluding once more, falsely reporting membership lists and re-registering for "work," appearing quite busy. On one hand, they are dispatching personnel to various factories in the Hongkou district to promote and entice workers from all industries to join. However, the workers of all industries are extremely steadfast in their will and have consistently ignored them. At present, the members of the "association" mostly hold a gold-digging mentality, seizing activity funds. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine what their results will be.</p>
<h3>Panama Merchant Vessel "Yongda" Released and Arrives in Shanghai After Detention in Lushun Last Winter, Panama Government Protested Before Release</h3>
<p>The Panama merchant vessel "Yongda," represented by the Norwegian business Wah Lun Yoko, arrived in Qingdao at the end of last year carrying timber. It was detained by the Japanese and frequently held under surveillance in Lushun. Subsequently, the Panamanian government protested to Japan, demanding its prompt release. After confirming that it was indeed a Panamanian merchant ship, the Japanese released it, and it sailed to Qingdao to unload cargo. Now, the ship has arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao and is permitted to complete customs clearance and load cargo on the 16th before sailing to Shantou and Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Issues Strict Order to Prohibit the Export of Cash Coins and Copper Materials, Violators Will Have Goods Confiscated and Forfeited, Severely Punished, and Efforts Will Be Made to Purchase and Hand Over to Factories for Melting and Reserve</h3>
<p>Document Yuqian Zi No. 2954 from the Ministry of Finance to the provincial governments states: Upon investigation, old cash coins were previously still in circulation in various regions. To prevent unscrupulous merchants from trafficking and profiting, this Ministry, following the regulations established by the former Ministry of Finance in Beiping, investigated and prohibited merchants and civilians from carrying more than 10,000 cash coins, which would be confiscated and forfeited. Later, in 1932, it was verified that these regulations were no longer applicable. Preventing the melting and export of cash coins had already been clearly stipulated in the standards for prohibiting copper exports promulgated by this Ministry. All original restrictions on carrying copper coins established by the old Ministry should be abolished, and orders have been separately issued to be followed. If merchants and civilians traffic in cash coins domestically without any illegal intent, it may not be necessary to prohibit it. However, it is now during the Anti-Japanese War, and copper is an important raw material for military equipment and machinery. It is essential to strictly prevent it from falling into enemy hands. In various guerrilla areas and areas connected to the enemy, military and political leaders should strictly prohibit the transport of cash coins or copper materials to aid the enemy. Violators will have all goods confiscated and forfeited and will be severely punished according to the circumstances and the law. If there are large amounts of cash coins or copper materials in the local area, the military and political departments, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, the Bureau of Ordnance, and the National Resources Commission should be requested to purchase and transport them to the rear, handing them over to factories for melting and reserve. In addition to cabling the Military Affairs Commission and distributing the information separately, a corresponding request is made to your province to investigate and order your subordinates to comply with it uniformly.</p>
<h3>Sand and Gravel Industry Strike, Association Reports Facts, Three Arrested Workers Fined and Released on Bail Yesterday, Labor Side Held Emergency Meeting the Night Before to Discuss Response</h3>
<p>Modern News reports that the sand and gravel industry strike remains deadlocked. The arrested workers, Fang Jinxiang and others, were tried and released on bail by the court yesterday. The association also released a statement of facts. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arrested Workers Fined and Released on Bail: Since the sand and gravel industry workers opposed Wan Tai Company's monopoly of the market with Japanese protection and declared a strike, Wan Tai hired more than 30 new workers on the morning of the 13th to transport sand and gravel from the detained ships in the Suzhou Creek, leading to a dispute with the striking workers. After suppression by the police, three striking workers, Fang Jinxiang, Liu Chunqing, and Xu Meiqing, were arrested. At 10 a.m. yesterday, the police sent the three to the First Special District Court for trial. Judge Meng Tingke questioned them in the Eighth Criminal Court. The defendant hired lawyer Feng Meixue to appear in court to defend them. Jin Xiong and Zhan Zhaolian appeared for Wan Tai Company. The police lawyer prosecuted them for obstructing order. The defendants admitted that the dispute arose from competing for work and wage issues. The court sentenced each of them to one month of detention, with detention convertible to a fine of two yuan per day. They immediately paid the fines and were released on bail.</p>
<p>Striking Workers Hold Meeting to Discuss Response: Late the night before, more than 50 representatives of the striking workers held an emergency meeting to discuss response measures, deciding to (1) issue a statement refuting Wan Tai Company's statement to clarify the truth to the public, (2) send a letter to the Lawyers Association to sanction its members, (3) find ways to rescue the arrested workers, Fang Jinxiang and others, (4) request Xue Gongxiao, the owner of the Sijiao sand land, to publish the truth about the ban, and (5) ask all fellow traders to take uniform steps to deal with illegal monopolies.</p>
<p>Association Releases Truth of the Matter: The Sand and Gravel Industry Association released the truth of the matter yesterday, stating: The Wan Tai Company organized a sand and gravel maintenance association in Sijiao, driving out local sand owners, restricting ships transporting to Shanghai, and monopolizing the production area, with ironclad evidence. Upon arrival in Shanghai, they again monopolized profits, exclusively set prices, and restricted sales. The facts are clear and need not be concealed. For example, the deduction of coolie labor for transporting sand and gravel has established rules. Why is it necessary for merchants to scheme only for profit during bidding? Production and sales of sand and gravel have already been monopolized, and coolie deductions are also controlled. Ruining the livelihoods of hundreds, how can one family be happy? Anyone with a heart cannot bear to stand idly by. Entrusted by its members, this association has a duty to speak out for justice. The statements made by lawyers Jin Ximin and Zhan Zhaolian, representing Wan Tai Company, are not worth debating and can be dismissed with a laugh. It is also hoped that Jin and Zhan will deeply consider their position as lawyers and not invite the reproach of being accomplices of evildoers. As for this association being a legal entity without a market or business, enlightened people can discern the allegations of manipulating market prices and controlling oppression, so it is unnecessary to discuss them one by one. The association also sent a letter to the Lawyers Association, asking them to inform lawyers Jin and Zhan not to be blinded by Wan Tai Company. Due to the length of the text, details are omitted.</p>
<h3>French Chargé d'Affaires Noppe Returns to Shanghai</h3>
<p>The English-language "Great America Evening Post" reports that the French Chargé d'Affaires to China, Noppe, has returned from inspections in Beiping and Tianjin, arriving in Shanghai this morning (14th) aboard the "Mingsheng." Commander Heerst of the French cruiser "Bracha Star" dispatched a speedboat to pick him up ashore, and a guard of honor lined the Bund to welcome him.</p>
<h3>Merchants Transferring Funds Can Request Police Protection</h3>
<p>With the Lunar New Year approaching, various shops and residents must settle accounts as usual. Therefore, there are frequent occurrences of carrying or transferring large sums of money. However, slight carelessness or lack of adequate protection can easily attract the attention of bandits, which is very dangerous. It is reported that the Shanghai Municipal Police Department, to prevent such incidents, allows shops and residents who need special police protection when carrying or transferring large sums of money to request it from the nearest police station. The police will dispatch patrols to provide protection, but requests must be made 24 hours in advance, and a small fee will be charged.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Explains the Meaning of "War Zone," Recognizing Areas Where War Has Occurred or Been Lost as War Zones, Approved by Executive Yuan and Sent to Ministry of Social Affairs for Reference</h3>
<p>To maintain the status quo of agricultural, industrial, and commercial groups during the extraordinary period, the Ministry of Economic Affairs previously presented seven provisional measures, promulgated on April 23, 1938. Article 1 states, "These measures shall temporarily apply to agricultural, industrial, and commercial groups in war zones." Article 6 states, "Agricultural, industrial, and commercial groups near war zones may invoke these measures." Subsequently, the Central Ministry of Social Affairs, noting that the term "war zone" was ambiguous in application, sent an official letter to the Executive Yuan for clarification. The Executive Yuan instructed the Ministry of Economic Affairs to reply, stating: The Ministry previously believed that agricultural, industrial, and commercial groups in areas where war had occurred or been lost could not practically convene general membership meetings to conduct re-elections. Due to the needs of the war of resistance, these groups could only have their original officials bear responsibility. Hence, the provisional measures for maintaining the status quo of agricultural, industrial, and commercial groups during the extraordinary period were drafted. The "war zone" mentioned in Article 1 refers to the aforementioned situation. The "near war zone" mentioned in Article 6 refers to areas where war has not occurred but are affected by the war situation, similar to the aforementioned situation. Areas under the jurisdiction of the war zone commander's headquarters that are still peaceful can still hold meetings and re-elections and are naturally not considered war zones as defined in Article 1. After examination, the Executive Yuan considered it appropriate and replied to the Central Ministry of Social Affairs for reference.</p>
<h3>Rice Market Closed Yesterday, Trading at Firms Follows Closing Price, Grain Actively Adjusted This Spring</h3>
<p>As the Lunar New Year approaches, various industries are beginning their year-end settlements. The Shanghai rice market closed yesterday. During the closure period, trading at firms will follow the closing price as the standard. The Bean and Rice Industry Association is concerned about the impact on grain this spring, so it is actively working to adjust and coordinate transportation and sales. Details of each situation are as follows:</p>
<p>Market Closed, Firms Settle Accounts: The rice market at 550 Fuzhou Road has closed yesterday (14th) according to the decision of the Bean and Rice Industry Association. The settlement period for rice traded by fellow firms and merchants is set from the 15th to the 16th, to be completed in two days. To thoroughly rectify any overdue settlements or disputes, the market has decided to refuse participation in business when the market reopens. Therefore, all firms and merchants should strictly comply with the association's decision and settle accounts to avoid complications. Stacked rice traded by firms on behalf of merchants should also be settled.</p>
<p>Rice Prices at Firms Follow Closing Price During Closure: After the market closed yesterday, it will reopen on the 23rd of this month. To prevent rice prices from rising during the closure period, fellow firms and rice shops are notified to trade at the closing price of the 13th (the day before the closure) as the standard and not to raise prices. Private deals are prohibited. The market price standards are: Top grade white rice at 12.78 yuan, second grade (including Yangjian, Lujian, and Jijiang) at 12.12 yuan to 10.35 yuan. As for rice shops selling to food consumers, the evaluation committee will determine the market price, distribute it to each member rice shop, and sell it at retail.</p>
<p>Association Adjusts Grain Supply This Spring: According to inquiries from various related parties by a Modern News reporter, the harvest was abundant last year due to good weather in various regions. It is a pity that a significant amount of produce from the coastal areas was seized by the Japanese and shipped out. As for grain produced in counties in the rear areas not directly affected by the war, the central government has a unified plan to reserve it for national use, preparing for long-term resistance for the military and civilians. Shanghai's food supply relies on the interior. Now, the rice supply in the coastal transportation area is weak, and transportation has decreased. Although Shanghai has a large reserve of national rice, there are concerns about the impact this spring before the new harvest. The Bean and Rice Industry Association, in addition to supervising the conduct of fellow traders, is deeply aware of the abundance and scarcity of food. To plan ahead and ensure a balanced adjustment this spring, a detailed plan will be submitted to the authorities for proper handling to avoid belated regret.</p>
<h3>Foreigners in Kuling Negotiate Evacuation, to be Escorted Down the Mountain by British and American Soldiers, Two Representatives of the Japanese Army Head to Xunyang</h3>
<p>A Japanese spokesperson stated that British and American authorities are about to send personnel from Xunyang to Kuling to negotiate the evacuation of foreigners on the mountain. Whether British and American sailors will escort the foreigners off the mountain is unknown, but this move is highly likely. Two representatives of the Japanese army recently left Shanghai for Xunyang to discuss this matter with British and American authorities. It is rumored that there are a total of 18 American citizens in Kuling, correcting the previous incorrect report of only 12.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Notifies Various Industries to Economize and Help Disaster Relief, Save on New Year's Eve Dinner and Transfer Funds to Help Stranded Compatriots</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified various industry associations, relaying a letter from the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Industry Group Fundraising Committee, initiating a campaign to transfer funds saved from New Year's Eve dinners to help those in need. Please inform all fellow traders to send all New Year's Eve dinner expenses to the Shanghai Refugee Relief Committee at 93 Wuma Road, specifying "New Year's Eve Dinner Savings" to show distinction and express enthusiasm. Upon receipt of the letter, the Chamber of Commerce stated that during this extraordinary period, economizing to help disaster relief is a determination that all Chinese people should embrace. The Chamber's proposal to save on New Year's Eve dinner expenses and transfer them to relieve stranded compatriots is a good approach. Therefore, the letter is relayed accordingly. Please investigate and encourage all fellow traders to act together. The Chinese Child Welfare Association Distributes Winter Clothing to Refugee Children: The Shanghai office of the Chinese Child Welfare Association launched a campaign to solicit winter clothing for refugee children on November 7th of last year. Starting from January 1st of this year, winter clothing was distributed to children on the streets, totaling 4,664 sets of cotton clothing. From the 9th, the distribution of winter clothing to refugee children in various shelters continued, totaling 1,528 cotton jackets and 1,825 cotton pants. In total, 12,681 pieces of winter clothing have been distributed to street children and refugees in shelters.</p>
<p>Method of Collecting Relief Funds with Dance Tickets: The Dance Hall Group Fundraising Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Relief Association held its first full committee meeting yesterday, chaired by Yuan Lvdeng. It was resolved to establish a method of collecting relief funds with dance tickets as follows: For dance tickets of five yuan or less, one jiao of national currency will be collected per guest at each payment. For dance tickets of more than five yuan, five fen of national currency will be collected per guest at each payment. The implementation of the above method will begin on the 17th of this month. The chairman of the committee is authorized to handle all related procedures.</p>
<p>Construction Donations for Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute: The Shanghai Refugee Children's Education and Training Institute is primarily raising funds for the construction of the institute. According to statistics, over 13,900 yuan has been raised, and the response to building houses and sponsoring refugee children has been very good. It is reported that after the institute decided to raise funds for the construction of the institute, it specially invited accountant Jiang Xinzhao to inspect the income and expenditure and released a report yesterday. A total of 23 houses have been pledged for construction, including one by Shao Yungeng, two by Gao Lansheng, one by Lu Wenying, one by Tianfa Xie Electric Company, one by Yite Society, one by Zhou Junxian, one by Qiu Yuru and Zhou Wusan, one by Ding Mansion, one by Ye Xichun, one by Dong Zhujun, one by Da Zhong Brick and Tile Factory, one jointly by the transportation and electrical industries, one by the steel bar and scrap iron industry, one by Xu Lifu, one by the jewelry industry, one by Huacheng Tobacco Company, one by the foreign goods and hat industry, one by the Shaoxing wine industry, one by the chicken and duck industry, one by Mr. Hui, one by Mr. Wu, and one by Qi Yin.

<h3>British Jardine Matheson Buys China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Si Hai Vessels, Renames Vessels and Ships to Shanghai from Hong Kong, Officially Joining the North and South Seas Routes</h3>
<p>The Yuanheng Lizhen Si Hai vessels of the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, built in England with Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds, have been anchored in Hong Kong since the outbreak of the war. They have now been bought by the British Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., repaired in Hong Kong shipyards, and renamed Xin Yi Sheng, Xin He Sheng, Xin Yu Sheng, and Xin Ming Sheng. The total tonnage of the four vessels is 13,511 tons, and the net tonnage is 8,396 tons. They have sailed to Shanghai from Hong Kong one after another and officially joined the North and South Seas routes, sailing according to the scheduled routes, known as "Special Express Vessels." A portion of the original crew has also been selectively employed by Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army and Navy Compete for Tax Revenue in Various Places Along the Yangtze River, Increasing Incompatibility, Documents Issued by the Army are Often Impeded by the Navy, Searches, Confiscation, and Shootings Occur Frequently, Merchants and Travelers are All Weary</h3>
<p>Since the Japanese occupied the coastal line, commercial traffic in various ports has developed rapidly due to inland transportation, with travelers and cargo transport being crowded. Various puppet organizations seize the opportunity to exploit, and the daily tax revenue is very large. In addition to puppet officials lining their pockets, the remaining amount is used to pay "administrative expenses" and support the Japanese army stationed in the area. Initially, the Yangtze River area was stationed by the navy. Later, because the Japanese military strength was insufficient, all the navy in the ports was transferred to the front line, and the rear was conscripting strong men domestically and transferring a part of the army from the front line to garrison the urban area. Later, the Japanese learned about the tax situation in various places along the Yangtze River, and using the pretext of searching and suppressing guerrillas, drew several small teams from the urban garrison to be stationed permanently at the ports along the Yangtze River, monitoring all actions of the puppet organization's tax "agencies" and dividing the collected taxes equally. Therefore, the Japanese army stationed along the Yangtze River were well-fed all day long, indulging in wanton desires. Each squad leader was heavily laden with money, and every soldier was accumulating a lot of wealth. It is now learned that the navy is also coveting the taxes at various Yangtze River ports, but because of military orders, it has not been able to dispatch troops rashly. Therefore, it has been instigating the puppet "Pacification Teams" of various counties to request the dispatch of troops to suppress bandits along the Yangtze River. The Japanese navy uses this as an opportunity for advancement, dispatching several warships to dock outside the Yangtze River ports, searching travelers, and severely inspecting all incoming and outgoing goods. Even with the certification documents issued by the stationed army, once they fall into the hands of the navy, they are even more difficult to handle. There are also frequent incidents of shooting or detaining merchants, resulting in the Japanese army and navy's opinions becoming increasingly incompatible, and the situation is becoming more acute. Due to this reason, commercial traffic along the Yangtze River has been extremely depressed. Places such as Hupu, Changshu, Baimao, and Xingang, where various industries used to trade collectively after the war, are now viewed with dread by merchants and travelers. Foreign merchant ships have reduced the number of routes due to the sharp decline in cargo transport.</p>

<p>Rampant Gambling in West Shanghai, Japanese Intentionally Cover Up, and Say That the Problem of Gambling Exists Throughout the World, Japanese Have Insufficient Personnel to Thoroughly Handle It</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that a Japanese navy spokesperson, in response to questions about gambling dens in the Japanese-controlled area of Shanghai at a reception for reporters last night (13th), said that the Japanese Bureau heard that certain personnel of the Shanghai Municipal Police Department were protecting gambling dens and making huge profits. However, the spokesperson immediately explained that there were rumors involving certain retired personnel of the Police Department. He then replied to another question, saying, "We believe this is still going on."</p>
<p>Interpreter Declares: The navy spokesperson expressed regret that his remarks about certain personnel of the Police Department receiving bribes caused an unpleasant atmosphere at the meeting. A reporter asked if the spokesperson would retract his remarks. The interpreter replied that the spokesperson regretted the atmosphere at the meeting, not his remarks. Yesterday, newspapers published the Shanghai Municipal Council's rebuttal of Japanese allegations that the Police Department was failing to curb crime in the Public Concession. A Japanese embassy spokesperson directly responded, saying that the Japanese could not accept the Council's claims that</p>
<p>political assassinations</p>
<p>were planned in opium dens and gambling dens in the Japanese-controlled area. Japanese Consul General Miura told the Shanghai Municipal Council that the Police Department had failed to arrest the criminals in the assassination case in the Public Concession. Although Council Chairman insisted that the recent activities of bandits occurred in the Japanese-controlled area, there was no clear connection between the crimes in the Western District and the Public Concession. The spokesperson also could not accept the Council's claim that</p>
<p>144 armed criminals</p>
<p>arrested came from the Western District. The spokesperson then said that the Japanese authorities believed that criminals and terrorists came from the Public Concession. The Council was trying to obscure the distinction between political assassinations and armed crimes, but there was no connection between the two. A reporter asked if the spokesperson knew that the Police Department's ballistics experts had verified that political assassinations and armed crimes were related. The spokesperson replied that, according to what Council Chairman told the Japanese Consul General, the Police Department only</p>
<p>suspected a connection.</p>
<p>The reporter followed up, asking if the Council Chairman had indeed said "only suspected a connection." After the interpreter spoke with other spokespersons, he replied that the Police Department "believed" that the recent political assassinations were related to previous armed crimes. The Japanese authorities are prepared to notify the Police Department that any suggestions for curbing crime will be considered. Regarding the Japanese embassy spokesperson's statement that the Japanese authorities are doing their best to curb all</p>
<p>terrorist activities</p>
<p>in their jurisdiction, a reporter asked if the Japanese authorities were also aware that a Japanese man named Yoshitai Ota (transliteration) had an office in an alley next to Yu Garden Road and was collecting fees from opium dens and gambling dens outside the Concession. The spokesperson replied that they had not received this information. He added that, as far as the Japanese authorities knew, gambling dens also existed in the Public Concession. A reporter asked if the Japanese authorities would notify the Police Department to investigate them. The spokesperson replied that they believed this was unnecessary, as the Police Department must know about these</p>
<p>gambling den villages.</p>
<p>Another reporter asked if the Japanese authorities had asked the Police Department to take action against suspects in the Public Concession and had been refused. The spokesperson replied that the Police Department had complied with requests from the Japanese authorities and made arrests, but the procedures after the arrests were most unsatisfactory. Turning to the matter of allowing opium dens and gambling dens to exist outside the Concession, the spokesperson insisted that the gambling dens were not being operated with the permission or protection of the Japanese army or navy. A reporter asked, then</p>
<p>how could these places operate?</p>
<p>The spokesperson replied that they had not been prohibited by the Japanese army, navy, or any Japanese authorities, but were operating in the Japanese-controlled area. The problem of gambling has existed for a long time and cannot be solved overnight. A reporter asked what methods the Japanese authorities were now taking to curb crime in the Western District. The spokesperson replied that, due to certain restrictions, the Japanese authorities could not deploy sufficient personnel to</p>
<p>thoroughly handle</p>
<p>this problem. At the end of the meeting, the Japanese embassy spokesperson said that he did not want his observations to cause a dispute between the Police Department and the Japanese Bureau, but hoped that they could cooperate to curb crime. He also stated that criminals currently detained by the puppet "Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau" will be handed over to the "Reformed Government" court for interrogation within a reasonable period of time.</p>
<h3>Four Banks Ordered to Accept Goods as Collateral</h3>
<p>The China, Central, Communications, and Agricultural Banks, in accordance with ministry orders, have established joint offices and lending committees in the locations of their various branches in order to facilitate the flow of capital for domestic finance, agriculture, mining, and industry. They are handling mortgages and re-mortgages of agricultural products, industrial products, mineral products, and central government bonds, as well as discounting of commercial paper and bonds due for principal and interest, and extending loans for railways, transportation, agriculture, and industry. The total amount of loans nationwide has exceeded 100 million yuan.

<h3>Japanese Army's Attempt to Attack Nanhui Shows Signs of Exhaustion - Chinese Forces Utilize Favorable Weather and Terrain to Maintain Control of Original Areas</h3>
<p>The Ogawa Unit of the Japanese Army on Shangnan Road in Pudong, and the Shinhiro Unit on Shangchuan Road, with only a few hundred exhausted soldiers and some elderly, weak, and young recruits, launched searches from Zhoupu and Chuansha towards the south. The soldiers from Zhoupu advanced along Shenzhuang and Xiasha to attack Xinchang and Luhui. The soldiers from Chuansha advanced along Shangchuan Road, Jiangzhen, and Dengzhen to attack Zhuqiao. Their ultimate goal was to converge on Nanhui County. After the guerrillas bravely surrounded and intercepted them, coupled with the continuous rainy days and the muddy rural roads, the Japanese heavy weapons became ineffective. The guerrillas utilized the favorable weather and terrain, gaining two major advantages, and fought several battles. The Japanese forces on both routes completely failed. The Japanese soldiers in Chuansha had already retreated to Chuansha City to defend it, using the puppet army to distribute themselves on the outer defense lines in an attempt to secure their position. The Japanese soldiers in Zhoupu also retreated from Xiasha and Shenzhuang back to Zhouzhen. The Xinchang and Luhui areas, due to the lack of highway lines, the Japanese did not dare to linger. The guerrillas resumed their positions as usual. However, it was heard that Xu Hongfa's troops were still causing trouble in Xinchang. As for Fengxian, the Japanese army once crossed the river from Minhang along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway to search for Nanqiao, but did not dare to stay long and retreated to Minzhen in northern Pudong. The Nanqiao and Xiaotang areas were all recovered by the guerrillas. Therefore, in the three counties of Feng, Nan, and Chuan, the guerrillas still controlled the original areas, and the Japanese army gained nothing.</p>
<h3>Golden Gate Exposition in San Francisco - Broadcasting to China</h3>
<p>According to the mainland report, the newest shortwave radio station established by the General Electric Company of America on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay began test broadcasts to China at 10 AM this morning (14th). Its call sign is WIGXBE, and the frequencies are 15330 and 9530. When Shanghai received its amplification this morning, it was still 6 PM on Monday evening in San Francisco. The second decisive broadcast will be made tonight from 4 to 10 PM. After the test broadcasts for these two days, the radio station will officially broadcast at 10 AM (Shanghai time) next Sunday, which will be 6 PM on Saturday evening in San Francisco, the opening of the Golden Gate Exposition. From noon to 6 PM, the radio station will also broadcast to South America, but it is expected that Shanghai will not be able to receive it.</p>
<h3>The Pudong Guerrilla Force Over the Past Year (Continued)</h3>
<p>Now, the administration of all counties in Pudong is operating as usual. The Jiangsu Provincial Government appoints county magistrates to handle all affairs. Political training work is carried out by the political training offices and propaganda teams established in each guerrilla force. In addition, an Anti-Japanese and National Reconstruction Public School has been established in a certain location to cultivate talents for various levels of leadership. Regarding the supply of military pay, because the government cannot provide it for the time being, the county governments collect taxes on land, goods, and various taxes to maintain operations. However, as long as it is a team that truly resists Japan for the people, the people would rather go without food themselves and send it to the team as military rations. Once, in a certain town in Pudong, when the Japanese soldiers withdrew and the guerrillas moved in, the people automatically raised the Qing Bai flag. When the team passed through the streets, they set off firecrackers and applauded enthusiastically. Isn't this a genuine expression of the people's feelings? In short, the national consciousness of the people in Pudong has greatly increased. They absolutely welcome any troops that serve the country.</p>
<p>(3) What Has Been Done in This Year</p>
<p>Work</p>
<p>Here, it is impossible to describe all the major and minor tasks performed by each guerrilla force, but only a summary is briefly recorded below.</p>
<p>1. Several Important Battles Fought in the Past Year: Although the Pudong Guerrilla Force is just a newborn infant, it has fought hundreds of battles with the enemy. The more important ones include: A. At the end of the year before last, the guerrilla force led by Li Boquan, with more than a hundred people, was surrounded by enemy troops at the Nanhui headquarters. After a long time of hand-to-hand combat, almost all of them were martyred, and only a few escaped. This was the first clash between the Yongdong Guerrilla Force and the enemy; B. In the early spring of last year, a large Japanese army came to attack and fought with Li Zhihuang's troops at Qingcun Port in Fengxian County. Both sides suffered casualties, and the enemy eventually burned the entire town to the ground, leaving it a scorched earth; C. In mid-April of last year, members of Yu Taosheng's troops sneaked into the enemy-occupied Xinchang Town, killing two enemy soldiers without any losses on our side; D. In early July, Ding Xishan's troops fought with the enemy's naval infantry at Zhagang. The enemy ship fired artillery to assist in the battle, but eventually retreated due to lack of support; E. Last year, on the anniversary of the August 13th Incident, the entire Pudong Guerrilla Force launched a full-scale counterattack. Yu Taosheng's troops attacked Shangchuan Road; Li Zhiming's troops, in coordination with Ding Xishan's Fan's troops, attacked Shangnan Road; and Ding Xishan's troops attacked the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. The intensity of this battle was unprecedented, especially Yu Taosheng's troops' attack on Shangchuan Road. The enemy had built strong fortifications at Zhuqiao Town, the end of Shangchuan Road, and had made full preparations in advance. However, Yu's troops, with inferior weapons and their flesh and blood, fought against them, engaging in fierce battles for several days and nights, turning guerrilla warfare into positional warfare. Although the enemy's rear was destroyed by us, they still resisted desperately. In the end, due to their fierce artillery fire, our side suffered heavy sacrifices. Xue Yongchang, the beloved deputy captain of Yu's troops, and his squad leader, as well as the machine gun team leader and deputy team leader, were all martyred in this battle. Their loyalty and bravery in battle truly shocked the heavens and moved the gods. As a result, Zhuqiao Town was finally overcome by us, and many enemy horses and ammunition were captured. This battle was the most intense in Pudong's history; F. On Double Tenth Day last year, our loyal Pudong Guerrilla Force launched another full-scale counterattack. Yu Taosheng's troops once again recovered Zhuqiao Town, and continued to pursue the enemy troops to Chuansha County; After Ding's troops destroyed Shangnan Road, they engaged in fierce battles with Japanese troops in various places. Twenty or thirty puppet police were stationed in Sanlintang Town. The pursuing enemy troops reached Zhoujiadu Town along the Huangpu River, where the Japanese troops could no longer escape. They all knelt down to Ding's soldiers and begged for their lives, which was extremely ridiculous, and were then all eliminated by Ding's troops. After this battle, the Japanese army dared not underestimate the Pudong Guerrilla Force and paid close attention to defending the two railways, almost to the point of being paranoid. G. At the end of last year, the enemy gathered all the Japanese troops near Shanghai, totaling more than 10,000, and launched a large-scale attack in coordination with the navy, army, and air force. The guerrilla forces advanced and retreated appropriately, and fought in separate directions. The famous martyr Zhou Qiuping (i.e., Zhou Dagen) was martyred in the Battle of Nicheng. In this battle, the enemy used the puppet army led by Xu Hongfa as a guide, and had sufficient ammunition, so they had an advantage. In this battle, the guerrilla forces suffered hundreds of casualties, while the enemy and puppet troops also suffered four to five hundred casualties. In addition, there were countless battles fought by various troops with the enemy, which cannot be recorded in detail. The current guerrilla forces are training daily, preparing to eliminate all the enemies in Pudong in a considerable period of time.</p>
<p>2. Eliminating the Major Traitors for the People: The crimes of traitors are even worse than those of the enemy, and the guerrilla forces have long hated them to the core. In early April of last year, Ding Xishan's troops took great risks, stormed into Yangsiqiao Town, surrounded the Japanese military headquarters, and shot and killed the traitor Zhang Shangyi and burned down his residence. Later, because a large Japanese army arrived, Lang's troops all withdrew. Last autumn, Ding Xishan's Fan's troops also used a trick to shoot and kill the traitor Li Tianmin in Lujiahui; Yu's troops executed Cai Songyao, the puppet magistrate of Nanhui County; the above are the most prominent. Since then, traitors in general have no longer dared to do evil as in the past.</p>
<p>3. Establishing Schools and Providing Relief to Children Who Have Dropped Out of School: In view of the Japanese army's implementation of enslavement education, which is extremely harmful to the country's future, the troops established schools everywhere to provide free education to children, instilling anti-Japanese ideas, and holding flag-raising ceremonies and political speeches every day. Therefore, the patriotic sentiments of the general public in Pudong are extremely high. (4) Lessons Given to Us</p>
<p>Although the Pudong Guerrilla Force has only been established for one year, it has given us many lessons:</p>
<p>First, it tells us: the military and the people should help each other and cooperate with each other, and must never be separated. The failures of several battles fought by the Pudong Guerrilla Force in the past year were all due to the fact that the military and the people could not understand each other and could not form a single unit. Therefore, in the future, we should devote more efforts to military-civilian cooperation in order to achieve greater results.</p>
<p>Second, it tells us: Guerrilla warfare will occupy a more important position in the anti-Japanese war in the future, and its role must not be ignored. For example, although the Pudong Guerrilla Force cannot completely drive the enemy out of the country now, it has at least restrained the enemy's forces. The enemy troops in Pudong do not dare to move easily now. Isn't this a kind of help for the war of resistance? In the future, we should strengthen strict training to give the enemy a greater blow.</p>
<p>Third, it tells us: All teams should cooperate sincerely to achieve victory. In the past, there was a time when the Pudong Guerrilla Force often envied each other, which led to conflicts, but in fact it was beneficial for the enemy to defeat them one by one. Although it has made much progress compared to the past, it has not yet reached the highest peak of unity. It must be known that planned cooperation and coordination, combined with warfare, can have a greater effect.</p>
<p>Fourth, it tells us: The importance of political work in the army. At the very least, the guerrillas must understand why we are fighting the war of resistance and for whom we are fighting, so that they can be brave in battle. The Pudong Guerrilla Force undoubtedly did not do enough political work, so there were frequent acts of disturbing the people and infighting. In the future, special attention must be paid to this point.</p>
<p>Finally, we respectfully salute the Pudong Guerrilla Force, which is fighting for the survival of the country, and wish them national liberation from afar! We hope that they will continue to improve and strengthen their strength, and become the vanguard in the future to recover Greater Shanghai!</p>
<h3>Lunar New Year Customs and Post Office - Still Open as Usual - However, Due to Sparse Business, Staff Take Turns on Duty</h3>
<p>The end of the Lunar New Year is approaching, and all groups, firms, and stores have been busy with closing matters and have scheduled holidays. It is learned that the Jianghai Customs, the Postal Administration, and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau will still be open as usual during the Lunar New Year. However, due to the sparse business, internal staff will take turns on duty.</p>
<h3>Property Owner in Baoyu Lane Requests Rent Increase</h3>
<p>The houses in Ningxing Street and Saiyu Lane in the French Concession are the property of Dehe Foreign Firm. The rent is highest along the Avenue Edward VII, at 120 yuan per building, 80 yuan along Ningxing Street, and 60 yuan in the lane (a 10% reduction was made last year). Due to the fact that landlords in the concession have started to increase rents and water bills, the tenants in Shiyu Lane received a notice from Dehe Foreign Firm yesterday, stating: "Dear Sir/Madam, the monthly rent for your residence at No. [Number] will be increased from 54 yuan to 67.5 yuan (an increase of 25% for all new and old houses inside and outside the lane) starting from March 1st of this year. If you do not agree to the above rent increase, we will have to terminate your lease on the same date, March 1st, and take back the house. We hereby send this letter as notification." The tenants were greatly alarmed and will convene a meeting to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>"Puppet Governor of Jiangsu Province" - Chen Zemin Dismissed - Gao Guanguan Takes the Stage, Chuan Xiao'an to be Transferred to Nanjing</h3>
<p>Chen Zemin, the "puppet governor of Jiangsu Province," has shown excessive flattery to the Japanese since taking office, earning considerable "merit." However, he was dissatisfied with the "Renovation Government," and it is heard that he has been dismissed and replaced by Gao Guanguan, the "Puppet Mayor of Nanjing," recommended by Chen Qun. At the same time, there are rumors that Fu Xiao'an, the "puppet mayor of Shanghai," will be transferred to succeed Fu as the "Puppet Mayor of Nanjing" due to disagreements with Secretary-General Su Xiwu, and Su Xiwu will be appointed as the "Puppet Mayor of Shanghai."</p>
<h3>工部局 本年度 圖書館預算</h3>
<p>The budget for the Public Library of the Shanghai Municipal Council for this year, together with the written opinion of the Chief of the Finance Department of the Council, was submitted for discussion by the Library Committee on the 2nd of this month. After revision, the budget listed total expenditures of 26,450 yuan, not including the cost of purchasing storage items, which was 10,660 yuan more than the previous year. The Deputy Director of the Library will be on leave this year, so travel expenses will be required. The cost of purchasing new books increased by 2,000 yuan due to the high exchange rate. The Director of the Library's salary has been increased, and all staff will receive salary increases in accordance with regulations, and subsidies will be granted separately. All of the above are the reasons for the increase in expenditure this year. Under the category of storage items purchase costs, there is a nominal expenditure item of 150 yuan for the purchase of bookshelves. According to the original budget, the cost of purchasing new books this year is estimated at 6,000 yuan, including 4,800 yuan for English books and 1,200 yuan for Chinese books. The Chief of the Finance Department, in view of the special fee-paying method for borrowing books by students, implemented, with 179 university students paying fees to borrow books, requested that 1,000 yuan be added to the cost of Chinese books in order to purchase books that cater to the preferences of Chinese readers. All the committee members expressed their agreement. The above budget, except for any revisions that may be made by the Chief of Finance in consultation with the Director of the Library, is approved for submission to the Finance Committee for review.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Dismissed Laborer Impersonates Official to Extort Money under the Pretense of Revoking Building Permits and is Arrested and Interrogated</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, the population of the Shanghai Concession has suddenly increased, more than doubling the usual amount, resulting in an oversupply of housing. All large and small hotels are booming and fully booked every day. As a result, general subleasers have been building rooms and lofts on sun decks and inside houses for subletting. However, these buildings are all built hastily and are prone to danger, so the Shanghai Municipal Council's Works Department has strictly clamped down on them, leading to some people taking this opportunity to</p>
<p>Use False Names to Extort Money. Li Baozhang, a native of Pudong, who lives at No. 45 Longmen Road, used to work as a laborer in the Shanghai Municipal Council's Works Department. He was dismissed because he had extorted money from people and was sentenced to imprisonment twice by the court. However, after Li was suspended from his job, the armband he received during his service was not returned. Recently, as the end of the year approached, seeing that the business of various hotels was booming, he had the idea of engaging in</p>
<p>Improper Thoughts. At 10 a.m. on the 9th of last month, he went to Zhaoshang Hotel at No. 11, Lane 566, Zhejiang Road, claiming to be assigned by the Works Department, pointing out that the hotel's construction was substandard and that its license would be revoked. After the manager, Wang Bingrong, pleaded with him, Li said that it would be impossible without 100 gold from a Westerner, Director Shou. After repeated negotiations, Wang handed over 40 yuan to Li, and the matter was resolved. On the afternoon of the 13th, Li went to Qinghe Hotel in Qinghe Lane on Zhejiang Road</p>
<p>Qinghe Hotel with the same method, plotting to extort a large sum of money. At that time, Li's momentum was fierce and his arrogance was extremely strong. However, the manager of the hotel, Yu Dayuan, observed his behavior and felt it was suspicious. He planned to inquire with the Works Department. Li, seeing that the situation was not good, took the opportunity to escape and immediately went to Yingbin Hotel in the same lane to commit the same act, plotting to extort 200 yuan. However, the Zha Division of Shanghai Municipal Council's Works Department had received a report and sent inspector Xu Haijiang</p>
<p>To Investigate Everywhere. When Li was extorting money at Yingbin, Xu happened to arrive. Li immediately tried to escape. Xu chased him to the vicinity of the small vegetable market on Fuzhou Road, and police officers He Renrui and No. 1353 arrived and apprehended Li. A Works Department No. 3 worker armband, a diary, and 15 yuan in cash were found on his person. He was taken to the Zha Division Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division. The police station's lawyer, Ru Bao,</p>
<p>Accused Him of Extortion and Intimidation under Articles 158, 204, 305, and 346 of the Criminal Law. He also said that according to the defendant's diary, the crimes he committed must not be limited to this. A detailed investigation is now underway, so please allow a one-week postponement for further interrogation after questioning. Then the managers of Zhaoshang, Qinghe, and Yingbin Hotels testified about Li's behavior at the time. Questioned by Li Baozhang, he admitted to receiving 40 yuan from Zhaoshang, but denied any acts of intimidation. Under the interrogation of Judge Feng Shide, he ordered him to be detained and postponed the interrogation to another date.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Builds Light Railway in Zhabei</h3>
<p>The Japanese side feels that the level of activity of the guerrillas in the four suburbs of Shanghai is increasing day by day, and there are no large armies stationed in the rear, only relying on military police and puppet police to maintain order, which is deeply worrying. Therefore, they plan to utilize the speed of transportation to strengthen defense and facilitate the mobilization of troops. Therefore, they are rushing to build a light railway. The starting point is at the end of Baoshan Road in Zhabei, with the eastern section reaching the downtown area, the western section connecting to the Shanghai-Wuxi Highway, and the northern section directly reaching Dachang. It will be completed soon.</p>

<h3>Lonely Man and Woman Confess to Adultery Without Hesitation - Xu Maochang's Wife Commits Adultery with Yang Jingyue - Each Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment, Commutable to a Fine</h3>
<p>Xu Qin, the beloved daughter of Qin Shanbao, a wealthy Ningbo merchant in the money industry, and the legal wife of Xu Maochang, a wealthy Ningbo businessman currently residing at No. 82 Tongfu Road, is 28 years old. She was arrested by the police after being reported by Xu for committing adultery with Yang Jingyue, a 24-year-old Wuxi native residing at No. 8, Lane 108, Tongfu Road, at the Cangzhou Hotel. She was prosecuted by the First Special District Local Court</p>
<p>Prosecution. Later, Xu voluntarily forgave her and requested the police station to forward the request to the court to withdraw the prosecution. Recently, Yang's legal wife, Wang Minxia, learned about the matter and believed that Xu Qin had seduced her husband, which was difficult for the law to forgive, so she requested the police to investigate and punish her according to law. Therefore, the police station filed another prosecution with the First Special Court. The details have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday morning, Judge Meng opened the court and summoned the defendants Yang Jingyue and Xu Qin to court for</p>
<p>Interrogation. The police station's lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, stated the circumstances of the case, saying that when the case was reported by Xu Maochang and the police were dispatched to arrest them in Room 309 of the Cangzhou Hotel, the two defendants admitted to committing adultery without hesitation, so there was no need to investigate the evidence any further. He requested that they be punished according to law. Questioned by the defendant Yang Jingyue, he admitted that he met Xu's wife at the Dahua Dance Hall in December last year and began to rent a room at Yipinxian</p>
<p>To Commit Adultery. Later, they moved to the Cangzhou Hotel, first renting Room 227, and then Room 309, until they were arrested by detectives on the morning of January 7. Xu Maochang's wife, whose maiden name is Zhaodi, wore a valuable fur coat and was covered in makeup. She stood side by side with Yang in the defendant's column, showing no shame or sorrow. When questioned about the time and place of the adultery, she did not hesitate to answer, just as Yang had</p>
<p>Confessed. Therefore, the lawyers of the two defendants, Wu Shoukong, requested that they be punished leniently. Lawyer Wu, who is related to Yang, explained the process of representing Yang to conduct a settlement with Xu Maochang after the adultery case occurred. Judge Meng then sentenced Yang Jingyue and Xu Qin to three months of imprisonment each. If commutable to a fine, it would be three yuan per day. The man and woman immediately expressed their willingness to accept the sentence and were released on bail by their respective lawyers.</p>
<h3>Fahua East Town Bloodshed Incident: Over a Dozen Strong Men Execute Three Men by Firing Squad; Two Were Korean Nationals, Corpses Removed by Japanese Troops</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, a burly man, approximately thirty years old, wearing a peaked cap, a bronze-colored silk-cotton robe, and yellow leather shoes, referred to as Mr. A, along with two Koreans dressed in Western suits, short overcoats, and high-topped rubber boots of a dark color, were drinking tea in a small teahouse at the intersection of Haige Road in Fahua East Town, western Shanghai. Suddenly, more than a dozen strong men armed with Mauser pistols rushed in and dragged the three men to the Hejia Wooden Bridge to the west. They first ordered Mr. A to kneel, but when he refused, the strong men kicked him into the river, aimed at his head, and shot him, killing him instantly. Subsequently, the two Koreans were also shot dead in front of Yongxin Coal Store, No. 159, five or six shops west of the bridge, on Fahua Main Street. Seeing their objective achieved, the strong men leisurely fled. Afterwards, Japanese military police stationed at Jiaotong University, along with puppet police, photographed the two Korean corpses and transported them to the Jiaotong University military police headquarters for examination. However, after Mr. A's body was retrieved from the river, it was placed on the bank and guarded. It is said that the deceased had been actively working for a certain faction, willingly collaborating with the enemy; further details will follow.</p>
<p>According to another report, yesterday afternoon around 3:00 PM, two Japanese corpses and one Chinese corpse were suddenly discovered on the roadside in Fahua East Town, western Shanghai, all shot to death. After the incident, Japanese troops stationed there immediately dispatched a team to guard the area and photograph the bodies. As of late evening, they had not yet withdrawn. It is understood that the two Japanese corpses were wearing military uniforms and appeared to be high-ranking officers, while the Chinese corpse was that of a translator. It is presumed they were killed by guerrillas in the area. It is also rumored that the three men were drug dealers.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Swallows Drugs, Releases Drug Trafficker: Confiscated at Roosevelt Wharf, Alerted and Exposed by Dissatisfied Patrolman</h3>
<p>Lu Pei, a Chinese constable with number 962 from the Xiaodongmen Police Station in the French Concession, 21 years old, from Huaiyin, was on duty on the first of this month at the Roosevelt Wharf. The "Xinsheng" steamship from Tianjin arrived in Shanghai, carrying a passenger named Han Guangyu from Tianjin, who had morphine hidden in the lining of his cotton-padded jacket. Constable No. 962 became suspicious and searched him, cutting open the jacket with scissors and confiscating morphine worth approximately</p>
<p>over three thousand yuan. Unexpectedly, the constable did not take Han to the police station but instead waved him away, swallowing the drugs himself to sell and use the money. Afterwards, Han felt aggrieved and entrusted Sun Longkui (32 years old, from Shanghai, residing at No. 8, Lane 353, Chongqing Road), an inspector at Roosevelt Wharf, and Zhu Cunfan (30 years old, from Dongtai, residing at No. 19, East Zilaohuo Street). These two entrusted Xing Rubin (38 years old, from Shandong), Chinese constable number 615 at the Sandoutou section of the Xiaodongmen Police Station, to plead with Constable No. 962 Lu Pei, seeking to</p>
<p>recover the original item. Lu denied it. However, Constable No. 832 on duty at the Roosevelt Wharf had glimpsed Lu's search of Han Guangyu. Therefore, Lu later gave the patrolman thirty yuan in banknotes as a reward. Unexpectedly, after accepting the money, the patrolman turned it over to the Xiaodongmen Police Station and reported the matter. After the head of the police station dispatched detectives to investigate, they placed Constable No. 962 Lu Pei, Sun Longkui, Zhu Cunfan, and Constable No. 615 Xing Rubin under</p>
<p>detention. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Yan conducted the trial. Fei Xizhen, a lawyer from the French Concession administrative authorities, presented the case and requested an extension for investigation before formally pressing charges. Subsequently, detectives reported the details of the arrest of the defendants. Lu Pei confessed that on January 30th, a guest brought 150 packs of morphine ashore from a ship and was arrested by detectives No. 240 and No. 269. The other day, No. 625 from Sandoutou came to ask me about it, saying he heard I got 350 yuan and told me to</p>
<p>return the original item, willing to reward me 1,500 yuan. I had no such thing, so I ignored him. Sun Longkui confessed that a friend entrusted me to ask No. 962 to return a sum of money. Because I didn't know No. 962, I entrusted Zhu Cunfan to speak to him, who in turn entrusted No. 615 from Sandoutou to negotiate with No. 962. Zhu Cunfan confessed that that day at the wharf, Sun Longkui told me that morphine had been swallowed by No. 962 and asked me to find a way. When I saw No. 962 and No. 615 coming, I asked No. 962. He replied that he only had</p>
<p>seven taels of morphine, which had been sold for 50 yuan per tael, totaling 350 yuan. However, according to the original owner, there were over 30 taels of morphine. Xing Rubin confessed that Zhu Cunfan entrusted me to ask No. 962 about the previous matter, but I was unaware of the details. The court verified the confessions and adjourned the hearing to the 25th. The defendants...</p>
<h3>Inheritance Dispute Among Merchants: Valuable Items and Property Evidence Stolen; Includes a Jade Cauldron Worth 150,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Zhang Ou, a Shanghai resident residing at No. 31, Dalu Lane, Luban Road, in the French Concession, 75 years old, has engaged lawyers Ge Zhi and Tan Deki to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. She is accusing Zhang Qin and Zhang Dai, concubines of her deceased son Zhang Bingxin, along with her grandson Zhang Haoqiu, and Huang Ruisheng (formerly residing at No. 296, Fulili Road, now moved to No. 74, Masnan Road), of conspiring to steal entrusted property,</p>
<p>abandoning elders, and requesting that they be investigated according to the law, and also requesting the return of the stolen goods through civil action. According to the complaint, the plaintiff lost her husband early in life, leaving behind her son Bingxin, who was only eight years old. The family was poor, and she endured hardship to raise Bingxin. In Bingxin's middle age, the family gradually prospered. They originally lived at No. 813, Shipi Lane, in the southern part of the city, and later rented a place on Talast Road. Unfortunately, Bingxin passed away from illness in November of the 26th year of the Republic, leaving behind valuable</p>
<p>items and property evidence (including items belonging to others), sealed in a leather suitcase, which was kept in the plaintiff's custody. In March of the 27th year, Bingxin's concubines Qin and Dai, colluding with Bingxin's son Haoqiu, secretly stole the suitcase while the plaintiff was out and hid it at Huang Ruisheng's house. Qin and Dai also left and never returned, disregarding the plaintiff's illness and well-being. Haoqiu deceived the plaintiff and moved her to Dalu Lane, Luban Road, on May 8th of the 27th year. On November 20th, Haoqiu also took his wife and</p>
<p>secretly moved out, avoiding contact and cutting off the plaintiff's livelihood. Only then did the plaintiff realize that Qin and Dai, in collusion with her grandson Haoqiu, had conspired to steal and abandon their elders. The plaintiff is old and ill, and cannot bear it. She requests that the defendants be brought to court to be charged under Articles 321, 349, 294, and 295 of the Criminal Code, and also requests through civil action that the originally sealed leather suitcase be returned, along with</p>
<p>the items contained inside, and requests a prompt disposition to first secure the original suitcase to prevent loss. The court accepted the case and, yesterday afternoon, Judge Miao Qingbang conducted a preliminary hearing in Criminal Court No. 2. The plaintiff and her attorneys were present, but the first, second, third, and fourth defendants were absent. The court, noting the absence of the defendants, did not conduct the hearing and ordered the issuance of summons, instructing the plaintiff to identify and summon the first, second, third, and fourth defendants to court for a hearing on the afternoon of the 25th at 2:00 PM. The deceased Zhang Bingxin was engaged in the jewelry business during his lifetime and held a significant position in the jewelry industry. Among the stolen items being pursued is a jade treasure cauldron worth a staggering 150,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhonggang Opens Clinic in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Dr. Wu Zhonggang, a graduate of the National Peking Medical University, was hired by the Zaozhuang Zhongxing Coal Mining Company in Shandong in the 7th year of the Republic to establish a hospital for the company, subsequently serving as the hospital's director and overseeing medical affairs for over 20 years. He has traveled both domestically and internationally for inspections and research, excelling in both academic and nursing aspects. The hospital he founded is large in scale, equipped with all modern medical equipment, which he purchased without reservation. He also personally oversees and manages everything, benefiting the miners and local residents significantly. People from various locations along the Jinpu Railway line have traveled far and wide to seek treatment, with an average of over 600 patients consulting him daily. He has long been renowned for reviving the dying and setting broken bones. After arriving in Shanghai, friends and relatives with illnesses have been constantly inviting him for consultations, leaving him with no spare time. Therefore, he has established a clinic at No. 9, Lane 542, Xiafei Road (next to the Paris Grand Theater) to facilitate treatment and save time. He offers reduced consultation fees for those seeking treatment before 10:00 AM to benefit the poor and sick.</p>
<h3>Telephone Lines Stolen Again in Japanese-Controlled Area: This is the Fourteenth Theft; Hongqiao Area Telephones Out of Service</h3>
<p>The Zi Lin Pao reports that telephone lines in the Japanese-controlled area of western Shanghai have been stolen again, affecting telephone service in the Hongqiao area. Repairs are not expected to be completed until tomorrow (the 15th). Telephone company and medical personnel began investigating yesterday (the 13th). Since the outbreak of war, telephone lines in Hongqiao have been stolen fourteen times. Details are as follows: On Sunday (the 12th) evening, a telephone exchange received a report indicating that the main telephone line in the Hongqiao area had been cut off. Company personnel immediately investigated and discovered that a main line containing 404 telephone wires, approximately 30 feet in length, had been stolen. The road on which the supporting poles stood had also been cut, severing two poles. Consequently, all telephone subscribers in Hongqiao have been cut off. The telephone company is working hard to repair the damage, and it is hoped that full service will be restored by tomorrow morning. Since May of last year, telephone lines in the Hongqiao area have been stolen in 14 locations. Aside from the company's losses, subscribers have been disrupted each time.</p>
<h3>Sudden Shift to Clear, Cold Weather</h3>

<h3>Robbery at Fortune Telling Studio: One Thief Shot Dead, One Accomplice Arrested</h3>
<p>Yao Wenzhou, a native of Ningbo, 44 years old, who engages in fortune-telling based on astrology, originally operated a fortune-telling studio in the Nine Mu Di area of the southern city. Because his astrological predictions are mostly accurate, his business flourished, and he accumulated some savings. After the August 13th incident, Yao moved to No. 47, Malang Road, in the French Concession, continuing his business as usual. His business has been even more prosperous than before the war,</p>
<p>attracting covetousness. Yesterday morning around 8:00 AM, two men, accompanied by two young boys around the age of ten, arrived at Yao's fortune-telling studio, claiming to want their fortunes told. They immediately produced handguns, warning everyone to be silent. They then snatched a small diamond ring from Yao's wife and searched Yao, finding 30 yuan in cash in his wallet. The robbers intended to search further, but Yao's hired maid</p>
<p>had already noticed. She rushed to the upstairs balcony and shouted loudly for help, alerting the police. The robbers hurriedly fled, rushing out the door and running north. However, Constable No. 695, who was managing traffic at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Malang Road, heard the alarm and rushed to pursue them, blowing his whistle loudly to summon other officers for assistance. One of the robbers, seeing the pursuing police officer, turned around and fired his gun to</p>
<p>resist arrest. The police officer also drew his gun and returned fire. The robbers fled north towards the public concession. At that time, three Chinese constables, No. 1758, No. 2724, and No. 3357 from the Chengdu Road Police Station of the Public Concession, also heard the whistle and rushed to intercept the robbers, firing their guns at them. Unable to withstand the lone robber with a single gun, he was hit by three bullets in his left hand and lower body near his hip. The wounds were critical, and he immediately collapsed in front of the Jiuda Pawnshop. The police officer took possession of his</p>
<p>handgun. The police also found stolen goods. The public concession police sent the thief's corpse to the Kung Foo Hospital on Shanhai Pass Road. After the doctor certified the death, the police sent the thief's corpse to the Tongren Fu Yuan mortuary for examination and requested that the Second Special District Court send personnel to inspect the corpse today. Simultaneously, the French police dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene to apprehend the perpetrators. As a result, one accomplice, named Yin Zhongming, was arrested. One young man suspected of involvement was also arrested, but after investigation, he was found to be innocent and was released.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Behaving Arbitrarily: Intentionally Making Things Difficult for Patrol Officers; Large Numbers of Detectives Arrive and Arrest Two for Interrogation</h3>
<p>The Guangsheng Company gambling den, originally named the Xinheng Entertainment Club, is located near the boundary of Bailinan Road in western Shanghai. The building of this den is the original site of the Guangsheng Primary School and was once temporarily converted into a domestic goods market. Due to business reasons, it was quickly moved. The manager of this den, Sun Shuren from Yancheng, who was also serving as the overall manager (similar to a manager) of the Daxin and Tongren gambling dens, considered the location to be superior and profitable. Therefore, disregarding the consequences, he went around looking for a den to start gambling, and secretly opened the gambling den about a month ago. Therefore, Sun also became the manager of Guangsheng due to his preparatory efforts. All the security guards of this den were also arranged by Sun. Yesterday afternoon at 1:40 PM, a rickshaw was parked in the alley next to the gambling den. At that time, many of the den's security guards thought that it was obstructing the entry and exit of gamblers, so they sternly ordered the rickshaw puller to drag it away. However, the rickshaw puller was slow to move because the road was even more inconvenient. The security guards wanted to beat him, but the patrol officer on duty in the area heard about it and was afraid of causing trouble, so he went to suppress it. Unexpectedly, these people were still fierce and unreasonable. At that time, Sun Shuren happened to be arriving from outside in a black-plated car No. 8191. Seeing the situation, after asking about it, he blamed the Chinese constable for being nosy and argued with the patrol officer. The security guards also started to make things difficult for the Chinese constable, threatening to beat him up. Seeing the dangerous situation, the Chinese constable drew his gun and fired two shots into the sky as a warning to escape. He then reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station, who immediately dispatched more than 30 detectives to suppress the situation. They arrested the deputy manager of the den, Li Wu, who had taken the lead in confronting the constable, as well as an accountant, and brought them to the police station for interrogation. The others scattered like birds and beasts, and the gamblers also fled in a panic.</p>
<h3>Coppersmith Loses Gambling Debt, Commits Suicide by Poisoning; Family Was Originally Able to Make Ends Meet, Careless Friendships Lead to Tragedy</h3>
<p>Hu Yugen, a coppersmith from Wuxi, 23 years old, worked at the Qian Yong Ji Electrical Manufacturing Factory at No. 30, Lane 370, Xiaoshadu Road, earning about 20 yuan a month. His wife worked as a female worker in a yarn factory near Mabai Road, earning about 30 yuan a month. The couple worked to make a living and were able to make ends meet. Unexpectedly, a friend invited Hu to gamble in gambling dens around western Shanghai a month ago. He went several times and always lost, losing a total of 300 to 400 yuan. His wife found out about it. Last night around 7:00 PM, there was a fierce quarrel in the family. Afterwards, Hu was extremely depressed and returned to the factory alone, where he had a sudden whim. He swallowed a cup of soldering water, unnoticed. Before long, the poisoning became unmanageable. After his companions noticed, they hired a car to accompany him to the Tongren Hospital for treatment. It is said that Hu took too much poison, and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3>Gambling Den Robbed</h3>
<p>The Xiang Sheng gambling den on Giesfier Road in western Shanghai has been doing good business since it opened, but cases of tragedy caused by gambling have been common. The other night (the 13th), while the gamblers in the den were enthusiastically trading, several bandits suddenly patronized the place, secretly. With guns in hand, they ordered all the gamblers not to make a sound and then went to each table to search for money, robbing over 1,700 yuan before escaping. The gamblers were also very frightened.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Tiantong Road</h3>
<p>At approximately 7:45 AM yesterday morning, at No. 727 and a half, Tiantong Road, Public Concession, five thugs, one of whom was armed with a handgun, suddenly threatened and intimidated the men and women in the house.

<h3>National Normal University Labor Specialization Department Specially Designated by the Ministry of Education: Students from Twenty-Four Provinces and Cities Participating in Studies</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Correspondence) In order to promote productive and organized labor education in our country, the Ministry of Education selected the National Normal University, which bears the highest status of national secondary school teachers' training and has previously established productive vocational and technical and manual drawing specialization departments, to undertake this important mission. In September of the 25th year of the Republic, it added the Labor Specialization Department, under the jurisdiction of the College of Education, stipulating a three-year program, and instructed each province and city to send one or two students to enroll. Each student is subsidized 150 yuan per year by the original sponsoring agency. The entire department has a total of 39 students, including students from twenty-four provinces and cities. The curriculum emphasizes both classroom instruction and practical training. Since the July 7th Incident, the National Normal University was merged and reorganized with Peking University and Beiyang Institute of Technology. The Labor Department was run independently by the National Normal University, initially holding classes at the Hunan Provincial Senior Vocational School, and then moving to the Central Vocational School in Wanxian. This summer, some of the department's students interned at the Dagong Iron Factory and the Huaxing Machine Factory, while the rest were assigned by the Ministry of Education to serve in the Second Social Education Work Group. This academic year, the Ministry of Education instructed the department to use the new school buildings and factories of the Central Vocational School for classes and practical training. However, because the construction and equipment are not yet complete, they are using the classrooms and factories of the College of Engineering of Chongqing University for classes and practical training. The current full-time and part-time professors and lecturers include He Yuan (teaching labor pedagogy and teaching practice, civil engineering and director), Sun Yiqing (teaching woodworking and model making), Guo Yuan (teaching metalworking and mechanical drawing), Wang Shulin (teaching educational testing and statistics), Zhao Tingwei (teaching general pedagogy), Yu Zhaoming (teaching vocational education and career guidance), Xu Fujing (teaching strength of materials), Wang Guanying (teaching electrical engineering), and Mao Chunpu (teaching mechanics), etc.</p>
<h3>Music and Art Schools Should Emphasize Domestic Teaching Materials; Schools Strive to Correct Past Mistakes and Promote National Spirit</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Dispatch) The Ministry of Education, considering that music and art schools have in the past placed too much emphasis on introducing Western music and art, neglecting the study of China's inherent music and art, leading to the loss of national spirit, has issued a special order to all schools to strive to correct past mistakes and promote national spirit. The original order is recorded below:</p>
<p>Ancient Chinese education was comprehensive in the Six Arts, with ritual and music taking precedence. Music's purpose was to transform the people, harmonize customs, and unite the country. Therefore, in ancient times, envoys were always accompanied by music, court audiences always featured music, banquets always included music, and sacrifices always involved music. Wherever there was ritual, there was music. As for art, our country also developed it very early. Examples such as the Six Steeds of Zhaoling and the Wu Liang Shrine engravings are renowned both at home and abroad. The Buddhist sculptures of the Sui and Tang dynasties were exquisite and unparalleled. After the Five Dynasties, the art of painting progressed even faster. By the Song dynasty, a painting academy was established, with specialized divisions for in-depth research. Descending to the Ming and Qing dynasties, the attainments in calligraphy and painting were also remarkable. In terms of their spirit, all were broad, profound, and radiated brilliance. These are all the elite of our country's inherent culture and the foundation of our society's moral fiber. Since the introduction of Western culture, progressive individuals, recognizing the inferiority of our material civilization, established schools and studied science to seek wealth and power. However, gradually, they lost confidence in our own culture. As a result, everything Western was considered perfect and worthy of imitation and transplantation, while everything inherent to our country was deemed worthless, despised, and destroyed. The music and art that had been painstakingly created over thousands of years and relied upon to cultivate virtue were neglected by society and the education sector, leading to the loss of the inherent national spirit, which is truly lamentable. Western music and art are not without merit, but their social background differs from ours, so the characteristics they express are also necessarily different. However, learning from others' strengths to enrich ourselves must ultimately align with the national spirit. Therefore, when discussing China's inherent culture, we say "starting from the root," and when discussing Western material civilization, we say "catching up head-on." Only in this way can we strengthen our national self-confidence, and only in this way can we restore our national status and promote universal harmony. The Chinese national character has always been known for its breadth, generosity, and magnificence, and the virtues of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, and peace are especially refined and profound when integrated into music and art. At this time of national revival, to restore the inherent Chinese national spirit of music and art, those responsible for music and art education should be even more diligent. However, in recent decades, those responsible for music and art education in our country have failed to pay appropriate attention to Chinese music and art, which is an undeniable major deficiency in spiritual education. From now on, all specialized music schools, specialized art schools, and music and art departments of universities and colleges should, in addition to Western music and art courses, make every effort to study and promote inherent Chinese music and art. Everything related to the recruitment of instructors, the establishment of courses, the selection of teaching materials, the organization of students' extracurricular research, the holding of art exhibitions and concerts, and all aspects of guiding students' spirits on a daily basis should be based on achieving the above objectives. Furthermore, concrete plans for promoting Chinese music and art should be drafted promptly and submitted for approval, with the aim of promoting the national spirit through the power of music and art.</p>

<p>Opinions on Reforming Education in Shanghai's Education Sector</p>
<h3>Current Opinions on Improving Higher Education in Our Country (I)</h3>
<p>— Yin Lou</p>
<p>What is the purpose of higher education? One purpose is to cultivate students' character, making them perfect individuals; the other is to train students in specialized skills, making them useful talents. Achieving these two major goals is certainly not a matter of a day or two. Education is a century-long undertaking. Those who run higher education should broaden their horizons, look ahead, and move forward with these two major goals, without changing them due to shifts in the environment. However, times are different, and society is constantly changing. The so-called perfect character varies with changes in moral concepts, and the so-called useful talents also change with social needs. Therefore, while the purpose of higher education may remain unchanged, the methods to achieve this purpose must adapt to the times and society. Use educational methods suitable for peaceful times in peaceful times, educational methods suitable for extraordinary times in extraordinary times, and educational methods suitable for revolutionary times in revolutionary times. Laws and regulations should be adapted to the times, and higher education should also be adapted to the times. Education that transcends the times is forgetting one's roots, and education that lags behind the times is backward. Forgetting one's roots and lagging behind are not the proper states of a country's education. Chinese higher education has existed for more than seventy years from its inception (starting with the establishment of the Guang Fangyan Guan). During these seventy years, there have been many reforms. In the first half of this period, higher education focused on classical textual research guided by teachers and Confucian scholars, adhering to old methods and being self-centered in everything. This can be said to be backward higher education. In the second half of this period, for the first twenty years, it mostly imitated Japan, and in the last ten years, it completely imitated Europe for a period and completely imitated the United States for a period, disregarding our national conditions and focusing on imitating others. This can be said to be forgetting one's roots higher education. Because of the backwardness and forgetting of one's roots in the past, Chinese education exhibits many pathological states. At this time of national crisis, how can we sit idly by and watch these pathological states continue and prolong? Now, the educational administrative authorities are convening the Third National Education Conference in Chongqing during this military turmoil, with the aim of correcting the pathological states of the past and responding to the current situation. Its significance is undoubtedly very great. I, as a member of the education sector, should do my best to express my humble opinions on the issue of higher education to the participants of the conference for their correction.</p>
<p>(1) Curriculum Should Be Practical</p>
<p>The curriculum of current domestic colleges and universities tends to be too focused on theoretical research and neglects practical experience. Of course, we also acknowledge the great contribution of theory to science, which is very important. However, emphasizing theory over practice is armchair theorizing and loses the goal of science. I often see many university professors, some of whom have studied animal husbandry theory very deeply but cannot raise a single pig, some of whom have studied horticulture theory very deeply but cannot grow a single flower, some of whom have studied electrical engineering theory very deeply but cannot repair a common electric fan, and some of whom have studied law theory very deeply but cannot draft a common pleading. Such college students and university professors are commonplace in China. They believe that theory is one thing and practice is another, as if they are not related. Therefore, students studying industry neglect factory practice, students studying animal husbandry neglect farm practice, students studying commerce neglect commercial institution practice, and the same is true for other fields such as physics, chemistry, medicine, and law, whether natural sciences or social sciences. They take theory very seriously and practice very lightly. If they cannot learn what they will use in school, how will they use what they have learned in the future? Especially in this extraordinary period of national crisis, the practicality of science is much more urgent than the empty talk of theory. Therefore, I advocate that the various specialized disciplines of universities should vigorously promote practical experience. It is best to cooperate with factories, offices, and institutions to form a close relationship, using theory as the research of factories and other institutions, and using practice as the implementation of factories and other institutions. Learning by doing, doing by learning, such research is true research, and such practice is true practice.</p>
<p>(2) Subjects and Teaching Materials Should Be Suitable for Students' Level</p>
<p>Regarding the curriculum, another point to note is that current domestic middle and high school programs often boast a large number of subjects and deep books. If we take the regulations of any university in China and read them, we will find that the subjects offered average more than thirty or forty per department. If we examine the books used, middle schools use foreign university books, universities use foreign graduate school books, and many are taught in foreign languages, as if this is not enough to demonstrate their high level. No one opposes raising the level of middle and high schools. I can also agree with having many subjects and deep books in the school curriculum, as long as most students have enough energy and time, as long as most students can understand, as long as the school has sufficient professors to guide them, and as long as the school has sufficient equipment and reference books. If most students can only study six subjects, you force them to study seven or eight. If most students are only at the middle school level, you force them to read university books. Even if the school has sufficient professors and equipment, I am afraid that only a few outstanding students can truly understand and master the material. And these outstanding students often die young due to heavy workloads and excessive effort (this is especially true for middle school students), which is a great loss to the country and society. As for most students, they swallow the material whole, without digestion. Many fail to build a good foundation in one or two subjects, which undermines their entire interest in and prospects for research. Therefore, although middle and high schools have many subjects and deep books, the result is not only useless but also harmful. Recently, the Ministry of Education revised the standard curriculum for various colleges of universities, which can prevent the abuse of curriculum design in various universities. However, there are still no unified concrete measures regarding university books and teaching materials. In my personal opinion, university books should be based on the level of university students, and professors should compile their own lecture notes and program outlines. If it is necessary to use foreign original books, except for foreign language courses, they should all be explained in Chinese. At the same time, I hope that the Ministry of Education will designate appropriate reference books for each course, requiring school libraries to purchase at least five or six types, and requiring them to add to them every two years, forcing students to do extracurricular research. On the one hand, we will urge the National Compilation and Translation Bureau to actively translate various foreign scientific books to gradually standardize scientific terminology. This is also the most important work in organizing university teaching materials. If we use the current method, where professors take the books they read in foreign graduate schools and explain them in class, or take their own compiled lecture notes and read them, and do not designate extracurricular research work, then it cannot be considered a good teaching method.</p>
<p>(3) Improvement of Students' Lives</p>
<p>Education should adapt to the social environment, as I have briefly explained above. We see that among the 450 million compatriots now, how many have enough to eat, and how many have enough clothes and food? In recent years, internal troubles and foreign aggression, natural disasters and man-made disasters, have been tormenting each other, and most people across the country are struggling to survive, living an inhuman life. However, when we think of the lives of most college students in China in the past (and probably still many now), they seek nobility, comfort, extravagance, and dissipation everywhere. The architecture and equipment of universities seek luxury and modernity everywhere, emphasizing form over spirit. This is using the education of the rich to educate the children of the poor, and using the education of singing and dancing to a country riddled with holes. It is creating a special class of scholar-officials for China. Where is the so-called education adapting to society? Without a spirit of hardship and perseverance, how can we talk about "cultivating integrity through frugality," "sleeping on brushwood and tasting gall," and "saving the country and wiping out shame"? We see that the university students in countries such as Denmark, Japan, and Soviet Russia take pride in simplicity in their clothing and are ashamed of extravagance in their lives. There are even many schools where the students build their own school buildings, and many girls' schools where the students take turns cooking meals. We also see that German schools have activities such as youth camps, rural service years, and labor camps, forcing students to participate in youth camps or rural service years to serve and labor before graduating from school, and to participate in labor camps to engage in labor after graduating from school. The work certificates for their rural service years and labor camps have the same importance as graduation certificates in terms of qualification for civil service employment. This is to train students to have a spirit of hard work and endurance, to eliminate the habits of公子少爺 (young masters), to make them aware of the suffering of the people, and to be able to serve the people. In other words, it is to simplify, laborize, and discipline students' lives. This is indeed the most meaningful way. At this extraordinary time, Chinese education should avoid the past emphasis on material appearances and neglect of spiritual training. We should actively promote organizations similar to labor camps and rural service years, and promote them separately in middle and high schools. On the one hand, we will train students to have a spirit of hard work and perseverance, and on the other hand, we will use this opportunity to enable students to understand the people, organize the people, and serve the people, in order to lay the foundation for the revitalization of the Chinese nation.

<p>School Overview</p>
<h3>Hujiang Vocational Evening School</h3>
<p>In the summer of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938), the Hujiang Compilation and Translation Bureau, recognizing the importance of vocational supplementary education, specially hired education experts and vocational education specialists to open the Hujiang Vocational Evening School, located on the third floor of the Mainland Shopping Center on Nanjing Road, and used room 328 on the same floor as the office. A summer school was first held, with courses in language and mathematics. Students from Jinan University and Guanghua University in this city, as well as customs and bank employees, came to study. Professors such as Cai Peisheng, Niu Shaolin, Wang Shudong, and Western professors such as Hale and Rosier were all well-known figures at the time. Therefore, many students stayed on to continue their studies. In the autumn of the 27th year of the Republic of China, in addition to the original language and mathematics courses, higher vocational and production technology courses were added. As a result, students from all directions flocked to the school.</p>
<p>The school's organization adopts a small class system, with each grade having no more than twenty students, so it has the efficiency of individual instruction and the competitive interest of class teaching. The school's textbooks are all practical, such as practical English, etc. The teachers also compile lecture notes based on their experience, which is a special feature. All the professors have graduated from foreign universities and have doctoral degrees, with a total of nine people, two Western professors, and the rest are also well-educated individuals who have graduated from domestic universities or colleges. There are currently 600 students, and more than two-thirds of the old students have registered to continue their studies. The planned enrollment for this semester is 1,000 students.</p>
<h3>School News Roundup</h3>
<p>Shanghai University School of Commerce. In addition to the university undergraduate program, the university vocational program, and other specialized programs, the School of Commerce in the downtown area of Shanghai University at 209 Yuanmingyuan Road also has a foreign language department, with English as the main subject, which students can freely choose to study according to their level. It is especially convenient for those who want to study English alone. It has always been taught by English and American language experts using the direct teaching method, focusing on more speaking, more listening, more writing, and more reading, giving students many opportunities to practice. It is currently recruiting male and female students. The second entrance examination will be held at 2 pm on February 25th. For simple preparation, detailed regulations are enclosed with a five-cent stamp.</p>
<p>Zhengfeng College of Liberal Arts. This semester, Zhengfeng College of Liberal Arts at 451 Jiangxi Road has a well-organized and substantial curriculum. The professors hired, such as Lu Xirong, Hu Pu'an, Lü Simian, and Yao Minghui, are all famous scholars who are enthusiastic about education and teach with patience and skill. Therefore, after two recruitment examinations, many students applied. It is heard that the college's departments will continue to recruit students on February 18th. It is also learned that President Jiang Zhuzhuang, in view of the fact that the study of Mozi's philosophy, which abandons profit and promotes altruism, is very suitable for the needs of today's society, has specially taken the time to give public lectures for two hours every Sunday morning starting at 10 am. Members of the public who wish to attend can register with the college.</p>
<p>Nanyang Tutorial School. There are indeed many newly established tutorial schools in Shanghai, but it is rare to find one that is perfect. It is recently learned that famous educators Wu Heshi, Qian Fuqu, Shen Ziheng, Zhu Xusheng, and others, in view of this, have specially rented a building at 302 Baike Road to establish the Nanyang Tutorial School. The heads and teachers of each department hired are all well-known figures, and the teaching is serious. Recently, registration has been unusually enthusiastic, with an enrollment of 1,000 students.</p>

<h3>Chinese-Western Middle School Basketball Game: Jinan and Qiaoguang Triumph; St. John's vs. Jinke Today</h3>
<p>The Chinese-Western Middle School Basketball Championship hosted by the American Public School had two matches last night starting at 7:30 pm. The game between Jinan and Soochow was the first to start. Jinan took the offensive after the start of the game. In the first half, Jinan led by two points with a score of 16 to 14. In the second half, Jinan's momentum was still strong. Soochow repeatedly missed good opportunities. In the end, Jinan defeated Soochow with a score of 42 to 27. In the second game, Qiaoguang played against Nanyang. At the beginning of the game, Qiaoguang was imposing, leading with a score of 9 to 2. After that, Nanyang worked hard to catch up, tying the score at 10 each. However, Qiaoguang soon took the lead in the first half with a score of 22 to 12. After the change of ends, Nanyang tried to cheer up, and the competition gradually became fierce. Due to too many points lost in the past, Nanyang lost to Qiaoguang by a score of 29 to 30 with a difference of one point. The game started at 6:30 pm.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results</p>
<p>Jinan defeated Soochow 42 to 27</p>
<p>Qiaoguang defeated Nanyang 30 to 29</p>
<p>Today's Order</p>
<p>Jinke vs. St. John's 6:30 pm</p>
<h3>Bank and Money Industry Basketball Team Match</h3>
<p>The basketball league organized by the Bank and Money Industry Friendship Association will still be held on the 21st of the Spring Festival at 4:30 pm. The association's representative team, the Bank and Money Industry United Team, and the Pengbi Team will hold an exhibition match at the Hongyi Middle School gymnasium. The Bank and Money Industry United Team has strong players such as Jia Youliang and Zhuang Youren, while the Pengbi Team is also famous in the basketball world. The competition will definitely be intense at that time.</p>
<p>Results of the match on the 12th: Jincheng defeated Salt Industry, 53-22; Sunong defeated Zhongfu, 63-10; Bank of China defeated North America, 76-6; Shanghai defeated Bank and Money Industry United Team, 46-18; Ninglian defeated Guohua, 28-14.</p>
<h3>This Year's Davis Cup: The United States Still Has Hope of Retaining It; Ample Young Reserves; Riggs Replaces Budge</h3>
<p>The major tennis tournaments of 1939 are now scheduled. Wimbledon will start on June 26th, six days earlier than last year, but it still adheres to the usual "third Monday of June" tradition. The French Championships will be held in Paris on June 8th, and the German Championships will open in Hamburg on July 14th. The US Championships will still be played at Forest Hills on September 7th. The first week of the Davis Cup will begin in early May, and the final week will conclude in Philadelphia, USA. Last year, it was held at the Germantown Cricket Club, but this battlefield for many famous players seemed somewhat inadequate. Therefore, the US Davis Cup Committee has decided to borrow the grounds from the Philadelphia Cricket Club.</p>
<p>The United States: Although the United States has now lost its mainstay, Budge, its reserves are quite plentiful. California is the most abundant source, so we must not hastily predict that the United States will "bid farewell" to the Davis Cup this year. Last year, Australia came close to winning the Davis Cup. If it hadn't been for the young Riggs defeating Quist, Australia would have already packed the silver trophy and shipped it back to Australia. Of course, the United States cannot immediately find a suitable replacement for Budge to defend the Davis Cup, but it has many useful materials to serve as raw materials for creating a Budge representative. For example, Riggs, Timbool (who has not yet been defeated by Riggs), and McHugh (the only person who managed to win a set from Budge in the US Championships), etc. In addition, players like Wood and Shields, former US Davis Cup representatives, are both only twenty-seven years old, the same age as Tilden when he first won the Wimbledon Championship.</p>
<p>Italy and Czechoslovakia: Italy has also joined the competition this year. In Europe, the Mussolini sports complex in Italy is now one of the most magnificent sports venues in Europe. Their famous player, Stefani, recently treated his injured foot in London and will soon be able to return to the court. Barroni, Romanoni, and Canabi have all made considerable progress, while Parmili has joined the professional world. Czechoslovakia has lost several famous players, and its strength is probably not comparable to last year. Denmark has a very good player this year, Jacobsen, who defeated France's strongest players, Borotra and Boussus, at the Swedish King's Cup this year.</p>
<p>England: The English Davis Cup team will probably be formed soon. They have quite a few good new and old materials. In the middle of last year, if Austin and Lee had played singles, and Hughes and Billington had played doubles, Germany probably wouldn't have won the European Zone title. If this team can attend this year, there is still hope for the European Zone title. However, their careers and their age will shatter this dream, so practically speaking, another team needs to be found and trained. Butler, Shays, and Fearby have gained a lot of experience and made considerable progress in their skills after returning from competitions in Africa. John's results this year are not bad, and he and Hale will soon go to the West Indies to compete, while Wilde and Billington will go to Norway and Sweden next month to compete.</p>
<h3>Tonight's Western Youth Basketball: Xu Fang vs. Little Bears</h3>
<p>There are three Western Youth games tonight. The first game is Xu Fang vs. Little Bears, with evenly matched strength on both sides, there will definitely be a fierce battle. The second game is Paramount vs. Qi Chang, where the situation will be one-sided. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Fang vs. Little Bears at 7 PM</p>
<p>Qi Chang vs. Paramount at 8 PM</p>
<p>Muir vs. Peng Bi at 9 PM</p>
<h3>Xiangqi Tournament: Yiyou vs. Zhanghua</h3>
<p>The Yiyou Cup Open Xiangqi Competition, organized by the Yiyou Society, has a total of eleven participating units and opened the day before yesterday. Today at 7:30 PM, Yiyou will play against Zhanghua at the Yiyou Chess Room. It is said that the Qingguang team will send members to serve as referees.</p>

<p>Science and Life</p>
<h3>Science and Art</h3>
<p>— Cao Youxin</p>
<p>Enabling ordinary people to enjoy aristocratic art is science's first great contribution to art. Before the invention of photography, only a small number of people had the opportunity to see the world's famous paintings. If you wanted to buy one, it would cost a very high price, which ordinary people could not afford. Sometimes, even with money, you couldn't buy it. Since the invention of photography, you can spend a few cents to buy a famous painting and hang it up, vividly and accurately. Some people say that photographs are not as good as the originals. This is psychological. Photographs are exactly the same as the original paintings. How can you distinguish between good and bad? If you say that the original paintings are more expensive and you feel that they are better, then money is the most beautiful thing in the world. Of course, current color printing has not yet reached perfection, but in the eyes of ordinary people, it is difficult to distinguish between current color prints and original paintings.</p>
<p>Science has also made great contributions to music. Phonograph records preserve famous performances. The price of a record is less than the ticket price to hear a famous performer live. Radio has further popularized music. When a person performs on the radio, millions of people can listen at the same time. Someone once criticized that listening to phonograph records is like eating canned food, and as for radio, the taste is completely changed. If this person has not seen good phonographs and radios, then he must be nitpicking. The sound quality distortion obtained by ordinary good radios is about 5%. Even musicians cannot hear this slight distortion. In short, those who oppose this progress are either outdated or selfish capitalists. Recently, the famous British scientist James Jeans said: "People think that a pianist can use various methods to play a key to express the emotions in his heart. This can be said to be completely meaningless." He also said: "American scientists have taken pictures of the sound waves when famous pianists play the piano. Later, using different weights to drop onto the keys, they discovered that the sound produced by a certain weight falling was completely the same as the sound wave shape of the pianist. Therefore, as long as the keys are struck with appropriate force, it is completely the same whether you use your fingers or hit them with an umbrella handle. The posture of striking the keys with your fingers is of course irrelevant...." From this point of view, scientists have solved the biggest finger problem for pianists. Artists certainly don't believe this. But I can predict that one day a robot will be able to play as well as a pianist. Also, since the invention of photography, art has gained a new type of photographic art. This can be said to be science opening up new territory for art. The invention of film has made the art of acting more advanced and realistic, and the public can enjoy it more universally. Therefore, science promotes the contact between art and the public, thereby making art more advanced and perfect.</p>
<h3>Applications of Ultraviolet and Infrared Rays</h3>
<p>— Dan</p>
<p>Everyone knows that the sun emits light and heat. We can see light, and we can feel heat. Ordinary sunlight is white, but it is composed of various colored lights—that is, ether vibrations of different wavelengths!</p>
<p>If we pass a beam of light through a prism, it is divided into red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and violet light, arranged in order. But there is light outside of red and violet, but it is either because the wavelength of the ether is too long or too short to be seen by the naked eye.</p>
<p>While studying visible light is interesting, in the past half century, scientists have also paid attention to invisible light. Doctors have found that people who have spent a summer vacation on the beach or in the countryside always feel comfortable and happy because they have been exposed to more sunlight. In the city, the air filled with gas absorbs many of the light rays that are beneficial to the human body before they reach our skin. One of these light rays that is beneficial to the human body is the invisible ultraviolet ray, so it is called that because its wavelength is just shorter than that of visible violet light. In order for people living in humid weather or in the dirtiest cities to get enough sunlight, scientists have invented methods for artificially creating sunlight. They use a long quartz tube with mercury stored at one end. When an electric current is passed through the mercury vapor, the tube emits rays rich in ultraviolet rays. There is another type of sun lamp, like an arc lamp, except that it uses 　 instead of carbon rods. Ordinary charcoal, if specially refined, can also generate ultraviolet rays. These types of lamps are truly amazing inventions, and every hospital now uses them to treat patients.</p>
<p>One of the characteristics of ultraviolet rays is that they are easily absorbed by obstacles. Clothing on people, and even the oils on the skin, can absorb ultraviolet rays and prevent them from reaching the skin, so patients undergoing sun lamp treatment need to take a bath first. Ordinary leaded glass can transmit ordinary light, but it will absorb ultraviolet rays, so sun lamps must be made of "quartz glass."</p>
<p>Ultraviolet rays have many interesting properties. Although they are invisible to our naked eyes, they easily sensitize photographic film. Therefore, although objects bathed in pure ultraviolet rays are invisible, we can use cameras to take pictures of them. If ultraviolet rays are used instead of ordinary light, the magnification of the lens can be greatly increased. Many bacteria are so small that they still cannot be seen with ordinary microscopes, so scientists have specially invented a microscope that uses ultraviolet rays. Of course, an ordinary person will not see anything under ultraviolet rays, but an expert can take pictures of bacteria under the microscope. These bacteria are so small that they can even penetrate porcelain. The greatest success of this invention is the discovery of bacteria that cause foot and oral diseases.</p>
<p>Household health ray lamp. Ultraviolet or infrared rays can be irradiated. Ultraviolet rays darken your skin and increase vitality. Infrared rays can treat rheumatism, neuritis, skin rashes, sciatica, and other diseases.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet rays also have great uses in industry. We can use them to distinguish colors that cannot be distinguished in sunlight, and we can also use them to distinguish　 forgeries. They can save textile factories a lot of money every year. Textile materials are often damaged by bacteria and mold, and this can only be seen when they are completely woven. Such fabrics are discarded. Therefore, in large-scale textile factories in Europe and America, any suspected village materials must be inspected in an ultraviolet ray room to seek pre-emptive sleeves.</p>
<p>There is also an invisible light called infrared rays, because its wavelength is longer than that of visible red light. Infrared rays　 are invisible, but the flames produced by gases emit this light. There is also a specially made clay filament lamp that emits a lot of infrared rays. People bathed in this light always feel comfortable, especially in winter, but its effect is milder than that of ultraviolet rays.</p>
<p>Infrared rays can be used for medical treatment. Infrared lamps do not emit visible light, so they are often equipped with a small red light bulb to indicate whether the lamp is working. Treatment with infrared rays is always carried out in a dark room to avoid interference from visible light. This warm and penetrative infrared ray often makes people with muscle diseases feel comfortable, and in some surgical procedures, this ray is often used to replace cutting.</p>
<p>The sun emits a large amount of infrared rays to keep us warm. Like ultraviolet rays, it can also sensitize photographic film. Scientists often use this light to photograph things that cannot be seen. For example, high mountains are often obscured by clouds, but if a special camera is used to block most of the ordinary light and only allow infrared rays to pass through, then the hidden peaks and valleys can be clearly displayed in the photo. The lenses used in this type of camera are replaced by reflectors made of rock salt because glass absorbs infrared rays. According to recent inventions, infrared rays can also be used to inspect the overheating parts of machines by photographic methods.</p>
<p>A single ultraviolet sunbath can make her feel energetic, healthy, happy, and less susceptible to colds.</p>
<h3>Heat Ray Lamp</h3>
<p>— Shang Yu</p>
<p>The American General Electric Company has invented a 10-watt heat lamp to treat various deep-seated congestion, which is very effective and convenient. The bulb used in this lamp is made of black glass that can only transmit infrared rays, and there is a reflector that can directly focus the infrared rays on the affected area. This ray has penetrating power and can increase the action of normal blood, so it can treat congestion.</p>
<p>This lamp is simple and safe to use. It is made of lightweight aluminum, coated with ivory enamel, and has a convenient switch and a permanently connected all-rubber covered cord. The power used is 10 watts, the voltage is 110 volts, and both AC and DC power can be used. Because it is lightweight, it can be taken to treat travelers who urgently need to treat congestion. The attached picture shows the use of a new type of lightweight heat lamp to locally treat congestion.</p>
<h3>Strange Restaurant</h3>
<p>— Xin Zhi</p>
<p>Once upon a time, Jin Benjia rented a house in a bustling city in the United States, renovated it, and opened a restaurant. After opening, the business was booming. However, after a while, strange things happened in this house, and the restaurant owner became unlucky. The waiters and servants he hired only lasted for three days and were unwilling to do this kind of business. The number of customers who came to patronize also decreased day by day. This was all because they were afraid of encountering strange things. What strange things? The silverware or beryllium silver cutlery in the store would turn black by themselves. The steel utensils and iron pots would move by themselves. The watches of the customers would suddenly stop. Someone told the owner that the house was next to a substation of the local power plant, and the surrounding households relied on this substation to supply electricity. He was afraid that the electricity was running into the next door and causing trouble. The owner did write a letter to the power plant manager, saying that the electricity they were generating was interfering with his business. He asked them to find a way to improve and not to let the electricity run out and cause trouble. The power plant manager received the letter and called the electrical engineer to discuss it, saying, "This person is probably mentally ill, but we might as well investigate to see if what this person is saying is actually true. But don't let him know that we suspect he is mentally ill." The investigator came back and reported that what the owner said was indeed true. Everyone was surprised and couldn't figure out why. So the manager and the engineer went to investigate in person. The owner took out the blackened silverware for them to see and arranged the cutlery as if preparing for customers to dine. Sure enough, the cutlery moved their heads and faced the wall. Then the owner led them to the kitchen to get an iron pot and put it on the iron stove. Before it got very close, there was a sudden clang, as if a strange hand had pulled it down and pressed it firmly, and it took a lot of effort to take it off. If they were cooking, the things in the pot would be in danger of burning. The owner also pointed out other strange phenomena for them to see, making them believe that what he said was true.</p>
<p>After some research, the power plant manager and engineer were able to completely solve this difficult problem with the help of science. It turned out that the wall of the power plant substation facing the restaurant was covered with thick electrical wires that conducted electricity in and out. Because of the passage of huge currents, these electrical wires created a very strong magnetic field. The magnetic lines emitted from this field could not be blocked by brick walls and had to be shielded with appropriate materials based on scientific principles. Therefore, a layer of thick steel plate was applied to one wall of the restaurant, which reduced this disturbance. As for the blackening of silverware, it was not related to electromagnetism. It was probably that the air in big cities contained gases such as magnetized hydrogen, which easily blackened the surface of silverware. This could only be solved by using more polishing materials and frequently polishing it to keep it shiny.</p>
<h3>Are There Humans on Mars?</h3>
<p>— Youxin</p>
<p>In the past, many astronomers believed that there were humans on Mars, and that their culture was much more advanced than that of humans on Earth. Their reasons for thinking so were: 　The channels on Mars are straight lines　 Mars has seas　 Has air　 Has green areas　 The highest temperature is 65 degrees Fahrenheit.　 The length of day and night is almost the same as on Earth, so it doesn't get too cold at night. Now the aperture of telescopes has also increased, and various research methods have also increased a lot. As a result, we know Mars more clearly. First, the channels on Mars are not straight lines. Mars is a spherical surface, and it is impossible to draw a line that looks straight from all directions, so proving the straight line is an illusion of previous astronomers. Its seas do not reflect sunlight, so they are "dry seas" without water. The air is very thin and does not contain oxygen. Because the air is thin, its heat dissipates quickly, so in the area exposed to the sun, its equator has a maximum of about 65 degrees, and on the side not exposed to the sun, the temperature is below minus 100 degrees. The composition of its ground is mostly volcanic ash. From this point of view, it is unlikely that there are humans on Mars.</p>
<h3>Clothes Made of Milk</h3>
<p>— Jin Tai</p>
<p>Now there are endless artificial materials in the world. It is not new to make rayon from wood pulp and weave cloth from glass fibers. Now a factory in Milan, Italy, is actually using milk to make fibers for women's clothing. Sixteen gallons of milk are poured into the funnel of the new machine used, and a large amount of fiber is produced at the other end of the machine, enough to make a suit of clothes and a coat. This unique method of making fiber is very satisfactory, so most European countries are setting up factories to manufacture it. The picture shows a beautiful outfit made from sixteen gallons of milk.</p>
<h3>World Science News</h3>
<p>Transparent Animals</p>
<p>Water fleas were originally just a delicacy for tropical fish, but in recent years they have gradually emerged in the scientific community. This is because they have a glass-like transparent body, and the internal organs are clearly visible, so scientists can use this to observe the internal physiological changes of animals. A few years ago, Metchnikoff used water fleas to study the way white blood cells defend life. After he had water fleas swallow a few fungal spores, he discovered that some of them began to germinate and invade the walls of its esophagus. However, white blood cells soon began to counterattack, destroying the hyphae and thus preserving the life of the water flea. We know that white blood cells in animal blood have both protective and curative functions, and this performance makes it even more credible. There are many examples of using water fleas to observe the effects of drugs on other internal organs, which cannot be fully described.</p>
<p>There is a type of goldfish called the Telescope fish, whose scales are transparent, so it looks like it has no scales. The whole body is four to six inches long and is a translucent or completely transparent body. Shorter ones are even more transparent. Their internal organs are also visible. After injecting a small amount of the hormone Cholecystokinin into the caudal vein, bile gradually flowed out of the gallbladder. This green or yellow bile was subsequently found in the intestines and had become a pigment. Other internal organs, such as the heart, sun, and even flowing blood, can also be seen under the right conditions. Therefore, the operation of animal internal organs can be directly observed without dissection or injury. This is another transparent animal besides the water flea that is sufficient for research.</p>
<p>— (American Industrial Gazette and Pharmaceutical Magazine)</p>
<p>New Weapons</p>
<p>Mr. Rost of Mexico City, USA, recently invented a new type of weapon, which has been approved for a patent by the US government. The explosive material for this weapon is gasoline and oxygen. They can be moderately combined and then burned in a gun. Their explosive power is greater than ordinary gunpowder and the cost is lower. It is said that these are their characteristics. Not only that, vibration, temperature, and friction do not affect the bullets, and there is no danger of automatic explosion.</p>
<p>There are two ways to apply this explosive material. The first is to use a specially made gun to inject a small amount of gasoline into a special cartridge containing potassium chlorate (which can release oxygen), and then use electricity to burn it.</p>
<p>The other method is to store gasoline and potassium chlorate separately in separate chambers of the cartridge, and still use the ordinary firing pin method to burn them.</p>
<p>According to the inventor, the complete combustion of the gas during the explosion is completed inside the barrel, so there is no special flame found outside the muzzle, which is different from ordinary guns, which is extremely beneficial for night attacks. The inventor did not mention whether this explosive material is suitable for air bombing, but it is generally believed that the same basic principle can also be applied to larger bombs.</p>

<p>Aluminum Film</p>
<p>Fischer Film Company of the United States has recently invented an opaque film made of aluminum, which is projected by reflection, and the pictures and sounds produced are very satisfactory. Existing transparent film negatives can be used to print this type of metal positive.</p>
<p>According to reports, this new type of film has many advantages. The most obvious is that it is not as flammable as ordinary celluloid film, does not generate any gas, and is not easily damaged. The company has repeatedly projected a roll of aluminum film 1,500 times, and as a result, no significant abrasion occurred.</p>
<p>Other advantages are that it does not wrinkle, crack, or mold, and is resistant to moisture. Because it is resistant to heat and cold, it can be used in cold and tropical regions; it goes without saying that it can be used in temperate regions. Also, because it is opaque and can be used on both sides, ordinary celluloid film requires 1,000 feet, while aluminum film only requires half the length—500 feet. In addition, the price of the aluminum sheet itself is very low, so the cost of this type of film is extremely small, and the future is limitless.</p>

<h3>Bad Habits</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>Speaking of uncivilized customs, it leads to bad habits. Uncivilized customs concern the public, while bad habits concern the individual. However, bad habits can spread and become uncivilized customs, so the individual's role seems even more important than the public's. It is indeed true: to regulate one's family, govern the state, and bring peace to the world, one must start with self-cultivation.</p>
<p>There are many bad habits, so many that one doesn't know where to begin. However, in my personal opinion, things like visiting prostitutes, gambling, and overeating only harm the person indulging in these habits, not others. Their impact is relatively small and can be considered secondary. Only those bad habits that affect a group, a society on a small scale, and a nation or race on a large scale, should be immediately eradicated as public enemy number one.</p>
<p>Among these first-class bad habits, I believe selfishness is the most serious. Selfishness manifests as grabbing and pushing. Grabbing jobs, grabbing rights, grabbing reputations... Anything that benefits oneself, one will exhaust all means to grab desperately. Pushing away responsibility, pushing away obligations, pushing away mistakes, pushing away troublesome matters... Anything laborious and without reward, one will hesitate and evade. In this grabbing and pushing, everything becomes chaotic and disorderly, public interests are sacrificed, and national interests suffer great damage. In short, one only knows oneself and doesn't know others; pure selfishness. The result of selfishness is mutual destruction, leaving no room for selfishness to begin with.</p>
<p>Second to selfishness is laziness, laziness in public affairs. Something that can be finished in a few minutes is often put off for three to five days at the least, and ten and a half months at the most, or even repeatedly put aside and forgotten forever. If something needs to go through three to five procedures, then if it's time-sensitive, it's almost guaranteed to become an afterthought; if it's not time-sensitive, it still hinders the progress of itself and other matters. Therefore, the harm of laziness is not much less than that of selfishness.</p>
<p>Selfishness and laziness seem to be the fatal wounds of our compatriots, as foreigners have often said. Do we still want to be human? Do we still want to be a member of the masses? Then we should deeply hate and abhor these bad habits!</p>
<p>Don't think that the world is full of such people, and that it's already too deeply ingrained to change. As long as everyone starts with themselves, regardless of success, failure, profit, loss, or gain; as long as there is this determination, this practice, the eradication of bad habits will be as easy as pointing a finger! The well-being of individuals and the public will also be achieved in an instant!</p>
<h3>Strings of Winter</h3>
<p>— Li Chen</p>
<p>"Winter is a pair of hands, and a pair of simple hands in chalk drawing." Do you deny this statement?</p>
<p>In that city and countryside which belong to us, which have never suffered the harm of barbaric enemies, winter meticulously decorates with her hands, filling people's hearts with fortitude, joy, and beauty.</p>
<p>Is this winter singing? Next to this bustling city, in the quieter alleys, comes the murmuring sound of human voices.</p>
<p>A gray background sets off a lonely cyan-black shadow - no, the sunless sky prevents her shadow from being clearly imprinted on the ground. So, I think, I can only describe her as a ghost-like figure. Her body moves forward step by step, her right hand constantly drawing and pushing in her bosom. This drawing and pushing motion accompanies a rounded tune. Every closed, silent door in the alley cracks open with long mouths, spitting out various heads, each pair of surprised eyes cast in the same direction.</p>
<p>This lonely figure moves closer, gradually allowing one to see that the thin body is wrapped in a faded and soiled gray-black garment. The bright voice tells me she comes from the northern country, that robust, straightforward northern country. The wind falls, falling from the high-rises where people are having scarlet dreams, scattering her black hair, the clothes rustling in the wind.</p>
<p>"This is the cold wind blowing from the vast north, girl, have you smelled the breath of the place you grew up in?" I mutter softly, my soul already flying to the distant, the faraway.</p>
<p>"Sir, listen to a little tune, won't you? I... ah! The year before last! I escaped from Jinan Prefecture, Shandong, the year before last!... " The sharp voice trembled in the air.</p>
<p>"The winter in the north is sharp and cold, but it is moving. It is this erhu that is sounding an intoxicating song in her hands... Spent her childhood in gentle days; a beautiful dream shimmering before her eyes. But the sudden rain of bombs swept from across the Yellow River destroyed this joyful beauty. Holding the erhu, she wanders, roams in a foreign land that is also her homeland, never finding a place to roost. With heavy steps, she asks the land for the sound of her hometown, and the land gives a physical response; in the cold wind, she tries to smell a little of the atmosphere of home, and the cold wind answers with constant trembling. Her stomach is often empty, leaving a strand of music on this street and that alley, rippling..."</p>
<p>I murmured like an old monk in meditation, adding a paragraph for her.</p>
<p>"How much, play a little tune to relax?" This is the "golden" word she craves.</p>
<p>But is what she craves just "how much"? This is just a little "Commander Oil" added when the car is unable to move forward; is her singing just to "relax" people? The praise of winter in the north, the shouts under the rain of bullets, the loneliness of a foreign land, the cruelty of the invaders... all are vented in her singing.</p>
<p>The melody of the zither ends, the singing dies away, I stand there stunned, watching the cyan-black shadow disappear alone into the distance. Having traveled to the ends of the earth, she must constantly accuse the crowd.</p>
<p>Who will give her a little sympathy? And who will ignite a prairie fire of revenge on this grief-stricken firewood?</p>
<h3>Nowhere to Stand!</h3>
<p>— Xue Sheng</p>
<h3>News from the South</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>To Mr. Dai Pingwan: Since Mr. Hong Lingfei's martyrdom, we have not only lost the opportunity to meet, but also do not know each other's whereabouts. My actions, perhaps you can hear one or two from friends, but regarding your actions, I have simply never heard anything about them. Recently, after withdrawing from Wuhan, I first went to Changsha and Nanchang. Later, I parted ways with Mo Ruo and the others; they went to Chongqing, and I went via Fuzhou and Hong Kong to Singapore in Nanyang.</p>
<p>The overseas Chinese in Nanyang are all sincerely patriotic. Seeing their enthusiasm and willingness to sacrifice is truly moving. The pity is that the general atmosphere is not yet open, and the dissemination of knowledge is not yet widespread, so they only know blind patriotism and reckless sacrifice. If they could have more knowledge and more organization, then the cornerstone of the war of resistance could be built by the overseas Chinese communities in Nanyang.</p>
<p>I came to Singapore to help edit the supplement of the *Singapore Daily*; my intention is to introduce works by domestic literary circles to the intellectual youth of Nanyang, and to introduce the creations of Nanyang youth to China.</p>
<p>Now, I have already written to Hong Kong (entrusting Shi Yi and Dai Wangshu), Xinjiang (entrusting Mao Dun), Yan'an (entrusting Cheng Fangwu), Chongqing (entrusting Guo Moruo), and other places to ask them to write and collect manuscripts; only Shanghai has not yet been entrusted to anyone. I would like to ask you to collect more manuscripts for me and send them here. If necessary, I can also provide you with some manuscripts and materials.</p>
<p>The financial market here is generally very prosperous; but the manuscript fees for writing articles are not very high. However, due to exchange rates, even the very low manuscript fees here, when remitted to China, can be about five yuan per thousand words (at the lowest). Therefore, I think, acting as a liaison broker for the cultural figures on the isolated island of Shanghai may not be a meaningless effort. After this letter is published, please reply to me immediately, or write some things and send them here. Just write "Singapore *Singapore Daily*" on the envelope. Yu Dafu respectfully. February 2nd.</p>
<p>This letter was sent by air mail and received yesterday, with an addendum: "Please borrow a corner of 'Free Talk' to disclose it, which can serve as a liaison line between home and abroad." So I am publishing it here, please pay attention to Mr. Dai Pingwan and all colleagues on the isolated island. Editor</p>
<h3>Chinese Wartime Music (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Sheng Muzhong</p>
<p>I remember that in 1936, when Suiyuan fell, every young and vigorous soldier who went to the front line carried a resolute spirit, singing the most popular song, Nie Er's "March of the Volunteers." Nie Er was truly a genius composer. After he completed works such as "Peach and Plum Robbery," "The Big Road," and "March of the Volunteers," his name was already well-known, and his works were warmly welcomed by the masses. Unfortunately, he died tragically in Japan! But his songs spread from one city to another, from one military camp to another, echoing his loud singing on the snowy plains of the north, "Arise, ye who refuse to be slaves!" When the soldiers charged into battle, everyone sang in unison: "Advancing, braving the enemy's gunfire, advancing, advancing, advancing!"</p>
<p>At this time, the singing movement in Shanghai was also very enthusiastic. Choirs from various schools and youth organizations organized small singing teams to teach singing in many factories. These workers, after their tiring work, raised their voices and sang, which was also very interesting. At that time, some of the songs taught were: "January 28th Song," "Pile Driving Song," "Pioneers of Road Construction," and "New Woman," etc.</p>
<p>After the July 7th Incident at Lugou Bridge, this kind of singing was even more widely promoted. The songs originally sung in the army and student groups were now being broadcast on every street, every alley, every village, and every radio station. This symbolized that the nation's spirit of saving the country had been developed to a white-hot level. Wherever there was a gathering of people, majestic singing, like thunder, roared out, making people feel the greatness of the power of the masses.</p>
<p>Many songbooks also became popular in response to the times, such as "Youth Song Collection," "Mass Singing," and "Anti-Japanese Songs," etc., all printed with songs that almost everyone could sing, aiming to promote songs, and the prices were very low, so the sales were also very large.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the war, many young people and students, especially women, often went to military hospitals or refugee shelters, sometimes teaching them to sing, sometimes singing for them. Everyone who heard the magnificent singing would unconsciously get excited, and the surrounding pain and current worries would be melted into the solemn singing.</p>
<p>Now the Ministry of Education is actively promoting singing work, preparing to hear these songs for saving the country in every city and every village, to use the effect of songs to publicize the national crisis, persuade the people to join the army, etc., and has specially organized several harmonious singing groups, each group with twenty male and female members, preparing to travel to various places to promote mass singing.</p>
<p>There are already many new songs that are popular now. If you go to the interior, you will definitely hear these fresh melodies! However, Shanghai can no longer hear them. A recent publication, "Mass Singing," is a collection of new songs, and the songs printed inside are mostly filled with the heroic spirit of combat, more passionate and more popular than the previous songs! Such as "Beat and Kill Traitors," "Graduation to the Front Line," "Farewell to Mother Before Expedition," "We Must Resist to the End," and "Charge Call," etc. We can know the content of the lyrics at a glance from these song titles.</p>
<p>It is said that in addition to promoting singing, the Ministry of Education is also carefully reviewing various popular songs to see if the wording is appropriate and whether the melody is suitable. In order to carry out this type of work, a new Music Education Committee has been established to undertake this mission.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also a National Anti-Japanese War Literature Federation, which is a private organization of several writers, and is also working hard to promote the creation of new songs suitable for this great era, and has formulated many song titles, using cash to reward soliciting authors.</p>
<p>The singing movement has reached a period of vigorous development since January 28th, and is now on the right track; I hope that in every corner of the country, every citizen will sing the magnificent songs, and from these songs, awaken the great spirit of the nation, organize the steps of the masses, to break the dream of invasion by the Japanese!</p>
<p>Listen, in the distance, a song is coming: "China has broken through its dark night, the people have forged their will into steel, the future has shown the hope of light, look, look, the beacon of self-salvation has spread in all directions!"</p>
<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>The manuscript fees for January have been settled. Please, the gentlemen who have contributed and been accepted, bring your receipts with seals to the accounting department of this building on the afternoons of the 15th, 16th, and 17th to receive them. Editorial Office</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>4\. Defending the National Defense Line</p>
<p>After a day and night of bloody battle, the outer defense positions of the national defense line guarded by Battalion Commander Ye's battalion were completely destroyed by the enemy's intense artillery fire, and many soldiers were killed or wounded. However, the enemy's losses were also considerable. Fallen corpses could be seen everywhere on the battlefield, and several armored vehicles and tanks destroyed by landmines and hand grenades lay tilted to one side. According to Battalion Commander Ye's idea, he still wanted to defend the position, but Battalion Adjutant Liang advised from the side:</p>
<p>"The enemy's firepower is so fierce, continuing to defend will only result in the brothers' white sacrifice. I think it's better to transfer the position and retreat to defend the national defense line. Fortunately, this time we are in a long-term war of resistance, and we don't care about the gains and losses of a moment and a place."</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Ye thought for a moment, and also felt that there was really no need to continue defending, so he took advantage of the enemy's artillery fire being slightly sparse, and ordered the entire force to transfer the position and withdraw to the national defense line to defend.</p>
<p>The so-called national defense line starts from Fushan at the mouth of the Yangtze River, passes through Changshu, Suzhou, Wujiang, and goes south along the Sujia Road, from Beijiang, Pingwang, Shengze, Wangjiangjing to Jiaxing, and then turns southeast, following the Jiaxing-Pinghu Highway to Zhapu and Dushan, forming a monthly-shaped flat circle line, which is more extensive than the past Songhu line, and more than several times larger.</p>
<p>At this time, the work of adjusting the front line of the Eastern Battlefield had been completed. Although the left wing was still in fierce battle in the Taicang-Kunshan area, and the right wing was still in the Pinghu area, the central road was broken through the Fenjing on the Shanghai-Hangzhou railway line, forcing itself to the Wangjiangjing of this national defense line. Therefore, the situation on the national defense line in this area was particularly tense.</p>
<p>The enemy seems to have consistently adopted the strategy of central breakthrough. Since occupying the outer defense positions of the national defense line, they have hardly allowed our army any chance to breathe, and quickly tracked and approached them. As usual, it was another fierce artillery fire. However, this time it seemed to contain some probing nature, and the fire net was not as dense as before.</p>
<p>Battalion Commander Ye braved the artillery fire, inspecting the trenches, instructing the company and platoon leaders on combat strategies, and at the same time solemnly instructing them to defend this national defense line to the death, and to have the determination to coexist with the position. After a day and night of artillery fire, his face seemed to be much darker, but the darkness revealed light, especially those two sharp eyes, placed on the dark face, were particularly clear.

<h3>Rare News from Hong Kong's Film and Theater Scene</h3>
<p>— Nie Ge, from Hong Kong</p>
<p>Lan Ping - Heroic Spirit</p>
<p>Someone who has returned from northern Shaanxi recently spoke in detail about the recent situation of the actresses Lan Ping and Ouyang Hongying in Shaanxi. He said that Lan Ping has changed her name to Jiang Qing and is now a professor and life instructor at the Luxun Academy of Arts. Ouyang Hongying is studying at the Anti-Japanese University, restoring her original name Ouyang Feili. Both are wearing soldier's uniforms, with the air of female heroes. Lan Ping is thinner than when she was in Shanghai, while Ouyang is much fatter, but both are in high spirits and seem quite content.</p>
<p>Liang Saizhen - Goes to Singapore as a Dance Partner</p>
<p>Liang Saizhen, and Saizhu, twin sisters who are both film actresses and dancers, were dance partners in Hong Kong, but business was not good, so they were recently hired to be dance partners in Singapore for three months. They will return to Shanghai when the term expires. It is also said that when Saizhu was in Hong Kong, she was hired by Hua Yi Film Company to act in the film "Tears in the War Clouds," but because the results were not good, the planned second film, "Mandarin Duck Revenge," was not continued.</p>
<p>Lin Shusen - Takes the Stage on New Year's Day</p>
<p>Lin Shusen has long had the intention of coming to Hong Kong. When Guangzhou had not yet fallen, all the luggage and equipment were ready. At that time, he chartered the Li Stage (the Li Stage is a first-class theater for Cantonese opera, and sometimes screens second- or third-run domestic films or Western films. Its architectural form is quite magnificent, and there are many seats. Mei Lanfang performed on stage here last year when he came to Hong Kong.) Theater, and prepaid a deposit of five hundred yuan. Later, because Guangzhou was in danger, Lin was afraid that Hong Kong would be affected, so he gave up the attempt to come to Hong Kong. He once wrote to the Li Stage to ask for the return of the five hundred yuan deposit that had been paid, but the Li Stage refused. This time, Lin was invited by Gu Wuwei and arrived in Hong Kong on the 11th. Hong Kong performing arts figures such as Xue Juexian, Tang Xueqing, Mei Lanfang, and Gu Wuwei all went to greet him. The couple Zhu Qingxian of Nanyue Film Company came to Hong Kong on the same ship. Lin Ling is scheduled to take the stage at the Li Stage on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Hu Ping - Betrays Original Intentions</p>
<p>Hu Ping in Hong Kong wears heavy makeup and flamboyant clothes, sometimes in men's clothing, sometimes in Western clothing. Her seductive state is disgusting. It is a pity that when she was hired by the China Film Studio in Wuhan, she wore a military uniform, carried a armed belt, and repeatedly said that she would devote herself to the work of saving the country to the end. Now she is completely different. She was once said to have joined the China Art Theater Troupe, but she did not join because the troupe could not meet her salary requirements. It is said that Hu has made friends with the son of a wealthy man, so her life has become luxurious.</p>
<p>Feng Feng - Famous in Nanyang</p>
<p>The hot dancer Feng Feng, who gained her fame by dancing the hula, has been performing with the Yin Yue Dance Troupe in various ports in the Nanyang Islands, and is very popular among overseas Chinese, becoming the mainstay of Yin Yue. Last August, she publicly published a marriage proposal in the newspapers, saying that she was willing to dedicate herself to the country, and would promise herself to anyone who prepared 10,000 Straits dollars to purchase national salvation bonds for her. Later, a certain Chen was willing to purchase national salvation bonds worth 10,000 yuan in national currency collected from years of hard work to respond to the solicitation, but Feng insisted on 10,000 Straits dollars (equivalent to 33,300 yuan in national currency), so it did not come to fruition. It is now heard that Feng has become engaged to a certain Xu, a local overseas Chinese, in Singapore. Mr. Xu has a good reputation in the society and is young and strong, which are the conditions that Feng is fond of.</p>
<p>Shao Zuiweng - Huge Losses</p>
<p>The Hong Kong Nanyang Film Company, formerly the Hong Kong branch of Tianyi Company, was destroyed by fire and is now run by Shao Min's second brother, Cunren. A fire broke out in the film production room a few days ago, burning a copy of the film "Dreaming of Wonderland," which was being made on behalf of another company. Fortunately, the films were placed separately, so the fire did not spread, otherwise the consequences would have been unimaginable. In those days, the Hong Kong branch of Tianyi caught fire twice in ten days, with losses reaching 200,000 yuan. Shao Zuiweng's efforts in Hong Kong for several years were almost completely wiped out.</p>

<h3>Impressions of "The Merry Widow"</h3>
<p>— Jin Ding</p>
<p>The spoken drama "The Merry Widow," directed by Liu Yixin and starring Fan Xuepeng and Tian Xin, was performed at the Green Room Theater on its first day, January 12th. In order to study the issue of women, I also went to see it once.</p>
<p>The main theme of the play is aimed at the remnants of feudal society, the pain of "widow chastity," and the current issue of love between men and women, as the theme of the plot. It describes the painstaking efforts of a widow surnamed Min to "maintain chastity and raise her orphan," and the general ignorant women regard her as an ominous thing. However, once she falls in love with the outstanding Liu Su, relatives, neighbors, and the general public will criticize her and slander her, which really makes her feel deeply stimulated! At the same time, in the plot, the romance of the social butterfly Ms. BB, the lust of the two elders Wang Du and Chen Geng, and Liu Su's lack of focus in love are also intertwined. After being entangled with BB, he is fascinated by her wine and beauty, and unknowingly signs a note, agreeing to sever ties with this poor widow.</p>
<p>However, this poor widow, for the sake of love, has already disregarded everything and dedicated all her sincere love to her lover Liu Su. How would she know that her lover had already accepted someone else's love, put her behind his mind, and not come to see her for more than a month? Therefore, she became ill due to longing. When she was very sick, her lover, Liu Su, came to see her. He didn't come to see her sincerely, but to prepare to discuss the matter of severing the relationship with her. It wasn't until Liu Su knew that she had sacrificed everything for herself, got sick for herself, and for herself..., he couldn't help but feel sad and was condemned by his conscience. He immediately expressed his true love for her and repented of his past mistakes. However, this passionate widow could no longer accept his love, and forever separated in her lover's arms. ... The performance of the plot is roughly like this. Among the actors, Fan Xuepeng's (playing the widow) expression was the most sincere; Hu Liaoran's (playing the doctor) opening his mouth to old morality and closing his mouth to classical Chinese was also very funny. Tian Xin (playing the social butterfly Ms. BB) is completely a materialistic romantic woman, and is a representative of some women in the current society; Tian Xiaoqing's (playing Liu Su) loving this one at first, then loving that one, and playing with women, shows no real love at all. In the current society, there are probably not a few playboys like him who are fickle and like the new and hate the old. Finally, the author's impression of this play, on the one hand, certainly feels that the "widow chastity" system left over from feudal society really needs to be overthrown; however, for the issue of love between men and women, both parties should also proceed cautiously. For young men and women who are fickle and lack focus in love, "The Merry Widow" is worth watching, because this is a good lesson for them at present.</p>

It is anticipated that the Refreshing Stage will be a grand spectacle today.</p>
<h3>Mr. Sun Lao Yuan's Record of Playing the Qin</h3>
<p>— Shi Wei Xuan</p>
<p>In the 13th year of the Republic [1924], I went to Beiping for business and happened to see Meng Xiaodong on stage, with Sun Lao Yuan playing the Qin. Since the death of Jiao Tian, Sun had never played the Qin for anyone, and this was his first time. Xiaodong's art originally had a foundation, and after Sun's guidance, her art improved rapidly. That day, she performed "Shang Tian Tai" and "Pao Cheng." Lao Yuan wore gold fingernails on his right hand, about two inches long, and frequently nodded to the audience as a greeting when he came on stage, eliciting thunderous applause. Initially, the right side of the pool seats was empty, but as soon as Lao Yuan appeared, it filled up without prior arrangement. These people did not look like regular customers, and when asked, the usher said that the theater owner had granted the request of Qin players from Beijing and Tianjin and specially opened the right side for them, without charging admission. When the music started, all the people in the booth closed their eyes and concentrated, sometimes sighing and sometimes beating time. The Qin music was sonorous, clear, and melodious, like pearls rolling on a jade plate, without the slightest bit of dragging or sloppiness. The cheers from the audience almost surpassed Xiaodong's. With the support of the famous Qin, Xiaodong sang with even more energy, and the audience couldn't help but praise the double excellence. After I returned south, whenever I recalled it, I still felt the lingering sound echoing in my ears. Later, Xiaodong didn't perform often, and Lao Yuan went south to Shanghai, where he once played the Qin for Dr. Mei, but he was unsuccessful and eventually died in obscurity, which is a pity!</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Imperial Palace and Peking Opera World of the Old Capital (106)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The addiction of actors to eating, drinking, prostitution, gambling, and playing with birds, beasts, insects, and fish, etc.</p>
<p>Wang Huifang enjoyed fame before Lanfang. At that time, he was greatly appreciated by the Queue Grand Marshal. Later, because he neglected his art and spent his energy on falconry every day, he got up early in the morning and went out, taking his hawk to the suburbs. His footprints were everywhere among the desolate fields and graves. The wind and sun gradually darkened his face, enlarged his feet, and made his body fat and strong. His face was also covered with some pustules. He no longer looked like a graceful and charming female impersonator, but was even darker than those who sang painted faces. Therefore, his reputation declined day by day. Later, he temporarily switched to singing young male roles to make a living, but he did not study hard like Miaoxiang, so he soon became idle again. It is now said that he makes a living by teaching students, and his situation is very miserable. Compared with Lanfang's situation, there is a world of difference. The ancients said, "Playing with things loses ambition." Huifang committed this problem.</p>
<p>Gou Huisheng likes to raise goldfish very much. When he lived in the Nanbanjie Hutong, he had a small courtyard, planted some trees and flowers, and also arranged many sand jars, in which he kept all kinds of goldfish. Although they were not as big and numerous as those in Beihai and Zhongshan Park, there were also some with peculiar shapes that were quite rare. Huisheng was also busy changing water and feeding them all day long, taking care of them with all his energy, but he became tired of it after a long time. Later, he bought a new house in Chunshu Hutong, and he was busy building a small garden, with painted beams and carved pillars, all painted in red, which took him half a year. Who knew that Yu San (Shuyan), who was good at making witty remarks, lived in the hutong behind Huisheng, and heard the sounds of hitting stones and sawing wood every day. One day, he came to Huisheng's place and joked to him, "When your imperial palace is built, you can guess the mechanism in my sleeve." This was because they had performed "Tan Mu" together at the Xinming Grand Theater, with Yu and Xun singing together, so Shuyan compared himself to a prince consort and treated Huisheng as a princess. This was also a way of taking advantage. Since Huisheng moved to this new residence, he set up a quiet study in the backyard, where he spent his days writing, painting, and reading opera scripts, completely abandoning his previous hobby of playing with goldfish.</p>

<h3>Finance: Cash Weakens with Foreign Exchange, Slight Fluctuations Mid-Course</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the black market for cash transactions fluctuated slightly, but the overall situation was generally characterized by an initial rise followed by a fall. Initially, because the Tianjin and Peking merchant groups were approaching the deadline for the forced cessation of circulation of local legal tender by the pseudo-organization in North China, they entrusted certain money changers and brokers to search for it, causing prices to gradually rise. Later, as foreign exchange was sold off due to foreign news reports, the situation slightly eased, causing certain gold shops to sell off more and more, and silverware shops also followed suit. Therefore, although there was absorption by Tianjin merchants and wealthy individuals in the city, the supply still seemed to exceed demand, and prices quickly turned downward. Finally, because money changers and gold shops re-entered at low prices, prices rose again, but the result was a drop of three yuan. Trading was brisk in the morning, but very quiet in the afternoon. Silverware jewelry fell by one yuan. Customs duties and China-British pure gold both fell sharply.</p>
<p>Cash fell by only three yuan. From the morning, each bar (ten taels) was initially offered by sellers at 2,059 yuan. However, most buyers were observing. After 9:45 AM, the Tianjin merchant group suddenly became interested in buying and entrusted a certain money changer to search for it. The trading started with the money changer buying 50 taels of cash from a gold shop at the opening price of 2,059 yuan. Later, the money changer's intention to buy remained strong, and the Northern merchant group also followed suit, maintaining a relatively stable momentum. At the same price, the Northern merchant group also bought 50 taels from a gold shop. Subsequently, the money changer came to buy again, buying 100 taels from Yuhao and 50 taels from a silverware shop, all at 60 yuan. Later, the Northern merchant group also bought 50 taels from a gold shop, priced at 62 yuan. The money changer then bought 50 taels from a silverware shop, at the same price. Then, they bought another 50 taels from the same industry, priced at 160 yuan. The Northern merchant group also bought 50 taels from a silverware shop, also at 60 yuan. After this, news suddenly broke that foreign exchange was being sold off due to foreign news reports, and the momentum slightly eased, causing buyers to become hesitant, and prices quickly turned downward. The money changer suddenly sold 50 taels to the Northern merchant group at 57 yuan. After absorbing it, the Northern merchant group also bought 50 taels from a gold shop, at a similar price. Although a certain silverware shop bought on behalf of a wealthy individual at that time, the sellers were quite eager, so it had little impact. The silverware shop bought 50 taels from the same industry, priced at 56 yuan, and then bought 50 taels from a gold shop, priced at 55 yuan. Later, the money changer re-entered and bought 50 taels from a gold shop, priced at 54 yuan. The silverware shop then bought 50 taels from the same industry, priced at 53 yuan. Finally, the money changers did business with each other at 50 taels, with a closing price of 55 yuan. In the afternoon, because foreign exchange rarely moved, and each merchant group was mostly observing, the market was quite dull. It wasn't until 4 o'clock that the money changer sold 50 taels to Yuhao at a closing price of 2,056 yuan, a drop of three yuan compared to the previous day. The total range of fluctuation for the day was eight yuan. Currently, Yuhao's listed price for gold sold is 2,065 yuan, and the buying price is 2,050 yuan. The current standard gold is 50 yuan lower than the listed gold, and there is no trading.</p>
<p>Jewelry gold is slightly lower by one yuan. Initially, the price of jewelry gold per tael was not changed, but at 10:30 AM, because cash transactions weakened, the price was reduced by one yuan. Da Tongheng and Lao Qingyun revised their prices to 208 yuan, and Xin Tongheng also revised their prices to 206 yuan, with a buying price of 200 yuan.</p>
<p>Pure gold suddenly shrinks by half a penny. According to a London telegram on the 13th, British pure gold fell again, shrinking by half a penny per ounce, reaching £7 8s 4½d. This caused the central bank's buying price for Chinese pure gold to also decrease to 1,211.3 yuan. The listed customs gold price remained unchanged at 2.394 yuan. The Shanghai standard gold price also decreased by 0.3 yuan, reaching 1,206.6 yuan.</p>
<p>Annam tickets fell by five points alone. Yesterday, British pure gold fell by half a penny, and the British-American exchange rate was closed for holiday. Foreign exchange initially remained stable, but later Hong Kong telegrams reported a sudden increase in selling, and banks actively sold. Although foreign firms were making settlements, the supply still exceeded demand, and the trend was firm. Cash transactions opened high, but later heard that exchange rates were easing, and retail investors resumed profit-taking, weakening temporarily. Later, wealthy individuals and Tianjin merchants absorbed at low prices, and prices rebounded slightly. The result was a slight decrease. Trading was brisk throughout the day, and fluctuations were not severe. For foreign currencies, banks slightly absorbed US dollars, and wealthy individuals still searched for US dollars and pounds, and prices rose slightly. Other currencies declined slightly due to easing exchange rates and falling gold prices. Annam ticket supply was slightly abundant, with a greater decline. Most currencies remained stable and unchanged. Trading by the association was rare, with only Baotai selling US dollar tickets to Yong Yongtai for 300 yuan. Yesterday's market prices: US dollar pound rose by 10 cents, US dollar tickets rose by 3 li, Hong Kong tickets fell by 1 li, Annam tickets fell by 5 points, Canadian tickets and Philippine tickets each fell by 1 point, and other currencies remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Discount Rate Returns to Normal</h3>
<p>Yesterday's discount rate for exchange bills slightly decreased, generally hovering around 3.15 yuan per thousand yuan. The final price was 35 yuan, a decrease of 0.25 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>Short-Term Wide Bars Narrows, Indian Silver Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>According to a London telegram on the 13th, India was buying, the East was selling, and the market was still stable. After the close, it continued to be stable. Short-term supply was limited, and there was some buying in the long term. Wide bar silver recently continued to rise by 0.01625, and long-term narrowed by 0.0625. New York was closed and there were no telegrams. Also, according to a Bombay silver telegram, the Indian silver market was firm, with spot prices continuing to rise by 3 annas, short-term also continuing to rise by 4 annas, and long-term also continuing to rise by 3 annas.</p>
<h3>Hong Kong and Little Luzon Sell Foreign Exchange Extensively</h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market saw foreign firms and Japanese banks buying, but settlements were scarce. Furthermore, banks were willing to supply, and Hong Kong telegrams and Little Luzon started selling extensively, causing the underlying trend to slightly ease. However, the mid-course fluctuations were still limited. Trading was still brisk, and the Hong Kong exchange rate slightly weakened due to frequent selling by money changers.</p>
<p>Initially, according to the London telegram, wide bars recently continued to rise by 0.0625, and long-term narrowed by 0.01625. New York spot prices were closed for holiday, and London raw gold shrank by half a penny. Exchange rates for British versus American, French, and Shanghai currencies remained unchanged. American versus foreign exchange rates were all closed and there were no telegrams. The central bank's listed exchange rates remained unchanged. Banks opened selling prices in the morning at 8.125 pence for British exchange and 15.875 yuan for American exchange. Compared to the previous close, both British and American exchange rates had no gains or losses. After opening, foreign firms were buying, but because banks were willing to supply, the situation lacked change. Foreign firms absorbed British gold at 8.125 pence and American exchange at 15.875 yuan from Da Tong Bank. Anfeng's listed prices were revealed to be the same as before, and the silver equalization tax was revealed to have increased by 5.0, with a levy of 7.50%. After this, Hong Kong telegrams and Little Luzon telegrams started selling extensively. At that time, Japanese banks came to settle, but banks' appetites were not good, so the continued trend gradually eased. Hong Kong telegrams sold British gold at 8.1401625 pence to HSBC, Dutch Wabie, and Maijiali, and Little Luzon sold American exchange at 15.901625 to 9375 yuan to Japanese banks and Wabie. Later, the strongest British gold was offered at over 8.15625 pence. Near noon, money changers frequently sold Hong Kong exchange to Dutch Wayi at 54.3175 yuan, rising to half a yuan. Therefore, the process also eased. At noon, banks' selling prices were 8.140625 pence for British exchange and 15.90625 yuan for American exchange.</p>
<p>The market was quiet in the afternoon, with only foreign telegrams and Hong Kong telegrams selling British gold to HSBC at 8.14.625 pence. Subsequently, foreign telegrams also sold American exchange at 15.93175 yuan to a certain bank. Therefore, the process was calm. Finally, money changers also sold Hong Kong exchange to Anda at 54.5 yuan. Extending to the evening close, banks' selling prices were 8.1401625 pence for British exchange and 15.906115 yuan for American exchange. As a result, British exchange was firmer by 0.01516115 yuan and American exchange was cheaper by 0.03125 yuan compared to the previous close. Hong Kong exchange also rose by 1.25. The one-day trading record is listed below.</p>

<h3>Securities: Half-Day Trading Easy, Highs and Lows Seen, Market Closed for Eight Days After This</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the last day of securities grey market. Only half-day trading was conducted. From the afternoon, the market was closed for the settlement procedures. The market was extremely quiet, with most transactions involving settling existing trades. With eight days of vacation ahead, it was difficult to predict future rises or falls. The environment was unstable, and whether this would strengthen or weaken international markets was not yet clear. Potential disruptions to international transportation lines were also concerning. Market sentiment was very uncertain. Apart from Xie Da's consistent selling over many days, there were few other noteworthy transactions. Most parties were preparing to regroup for a strong start in the new year. The initial activity yesterday involved selling by Xie Da and distressed selling by Shen Chang. However, Xie Da only sold Class A and D bonds. Later, absorption by Runli and Yongkang, and short covering by Lianhe, caused prices to rebound slightly. The most quiet market was the 96, which was off by a little over 1.5 cents due to retail investors selling spot goods to raise funds. The result was mixed for unified bonds, with highs and lows differing by 1 to 2 cents. Trading volume was approximately 300,000 yuan. The market closed in the afternoon, and will reopen on the 23rd. A simplified table is listed below.</p>
<p>There was no stock trading.</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton: Huge Amounts Being Added at Low Prices, Yarn Prices Seen Rising Again, Shuangma and Jincheng Each Rise by 3-5 Yuan</p>
<p>The yarn market, which had been tired for two days, now recovered and rose again. Since the Japanese army occupied Qiongzhou Island, there was no obstruction to the return transportation line, so market sentiment turned bullish. Furthermore, Mr. Wu's continued absorption has accumulated more and more. It is said that he is still buying at low prices, showing his loose funds. Also, some have sold public bonds and invested in cotton yarn, tightening the market supply even further. However, a certain cotton company sells a large amount every day, all of which are warehouse receipts for spot goods, slightly easing the surface.</p>
<p>Current yarn conditions: Initially, the atmosphere was hot and tightened, as major players continued to buy. At the same time, most of the floating shorts had already been settled on the previous day. Seeing the tightening, someone was intent on raising prices, and the market immediately advanced. Opening was up one yuan, and the price of 20s Shuangma yarn was 394 yuan. With good market sentiment, buying was even stronger, rising step by step. Although a certain company sold a large amount of 20s Shuangma warehouse receipt goods, 500 bales, the buyer's appetite was still healthy. The final price for 20s Bianma was 2196 yuan, Shuang 지구 (Earth) was done at 393 yuan. The results of the morning transaction statistics were 715 bales, compared to 255 bales in the previous afternoon. The market price of 20s Shuangma rose by 3 yuan, Tejin Cheng rose by 5 yuan, Tiannv rose by 2.5 yuan, and Shuang 지구 rose by 5 yuan. The Tianjin merchant group's appetite for 10s coarse yarn was still strong, with no major changes. Today, 19 pieces of exported cotton yarn were transported to Tianjin, 16 pieces to Yantai, 50 pieces to Hong Kong, 85 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, 610 pieces to Haiphong, 9 pieces of piece goods to Tianjin, 29 pieces to Yantai, 20 pieces to Shantou, 50 pieces to Hong Kong, 110 pieces to Guangzhou Bay, and 760 pieces to Haiphong. The amount purchased by each group is listed on the left.</p>
<p>The Japanese yarn market was unusually calm, indeed寂静. This is because all parties were busy settling accounts. However, market prices rose slightly, as many were unwilling to sell at low prices. The spot price of 20s Shuiyue yarn was 328 yuan, and the spot price of 20s Lanfeng yarn was around 323.5 yuan.</p>
<h3>Only Scattered Touches in Sino-Foreign Cotton Transactions</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton market prices: Yesterday was President Lin Xu's birthday, and the New York American cotton market was closed. A telegram from a New York head office predicted that today's American cotton opening would rise by 8 pounds. India fell by another 1 robee yesterday. The white block for April/May was 1507.5, the lowest price since September. Egyptian cotton fell by 10 pounds. Yesterday, exchange rates slightly lengthened, and converted to national currency, the price of American cotton and Brazilian cotton each rose by 8 jiao per dan, Egyptian cotton fell by 2 jiao, and Indian cotton fell by more than 1 yuan per dan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market was very quiet, as the end of the year was approaching. However, yesterday, because Indian cotton prices were low, Hefeng Factory would buy 200 bales of Indian cotton, and the combined factory price was approximately 74 yuan. Other factories were busy closing their accounts and had no appetite for foreign cotton. Foreign cotton transactions will be served at the red board. Yesterday's cotton prices are recorded below.</p>
<p>Native cotton business remained quiet. Changfang entered 200 pieces of American cotton above 20s from Xinyu, and other manufacturers had no appetite. However, the industry had some scattered transactions, just touches. There was not much supply from Subei, with only 125 pieces coming from Xinyu and 150 pieces coming from Baiwei. The spot cotton transaction situation is recorded on the left.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Users Silk, Hoarding Enthusiasm, Silk and Tea Shipped to Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday New York was closed for holiday, Yokohama spot was 930 yuan, recent was 921 yuan, long-term was 901 yuan, slightly lower than the previous market. The Shanghai market situation continued to be firm, so after the American firm sold at 1,520 yuan and the French firm sold at 1,500 yuan (the mid-week market price), it stopped. And because of the enthusiasm of hoarding psychology, users in the market can still rise again at high prices. Yesterday, the White Factory B-type Yangfan ordinary silk brand had been sold at 1,550 yuan, and Jili silk Qilin horse race had been sold at 900 yuan, truly making foreign firms sigh. Yesterday, users entered a total of 50担, and foreign firms transacted Jili warp silk 10担 and back silk 10担.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 617 pieces of Huzhou silk were transported to Europe, and 10 pieces of Huzhou silk and 217 pieces of silk heads were transported to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday 38 tons of tea were shipped to England, 1,426 boxes were shipped to France, and 9 pieces were shipped to Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Coal: American Coal Arrives in Shanghai, Totaling Over 7,000 Tons, Indian Coal Also Arrives</h3>
<p>It can be said that there is absolutely no problem with fuel in this city. In addition to large quantities of Hongji and Indian coal being imported, American coal has recently been transported in. Yesterday, there was another large quantity of coal delivered, reaching more than 16,000 tons. It is estimated that the S.S. Asunda号 entered the port yesterday morning, transporting 8,353 tons from Calcutta, India. Also, the S.S. Dalblair号 entered the port at 5:00 PM yesterday, carrying 7,778 tons from San Francisco, USA. Both are being unloaded starting today. (祖)</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Diaoqing Production Prices are Even More Upside Down</h3>
<p>——3,600 Bags of Sugar Imported——</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was firm. The association's designated disk, 24 Dutch coarse white outer stack goods called the original price, the stack goods were 24.4 yuan, transit goods were 16.2 yuan, and 300 bags had already been made. The big money Mark high coarse white stack goods were 24.5 yuan, with more than 100 bags transacted. The rest of the Dutch red spot goods were 116.5 yuan, transit goods were 11 yuan, Taikoo red H Mark spot goods were 16.5 yuan, Taikoo white B Mark was 24 yuan, CW Mark was 23.9 yuan, OX Mark was 23.8 yuan, DY Mark was 22.7 yuan, and HX Mark was 23.6 yuan. There was not much coming and going, and domestic sugar lacked ups and downs, with only scattered transactions. According to Gulangyu News, the production price of Diaoqing has risen by another 6-7 jiao, so the upside down is even worse. Yesterday, 1,150 bags of sugar came from Haikou, 500 bags came from Hong Kong, and 2,030 bags came from Shantou.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Southern Qianshi Rises Again by 20 Yuan</h3>
<p>Southern pond qianshi are being sold, because the arrival and storage are both lacking, and the firm's hand goods are also limited, so the sales disk has risen again by 20 yuan. Yesterday, the market was called 180 yuan, and some scattered sales had already been made. Other qianshi rose by 10 yuan, sold for 70 yuan. These items all require handmade peeling, so with the shelled qianshi, it is necessary to invite insiders to modify the production, the production is extremely slow, and the cost is very expensive.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Predicting that Woolen Fabrics Will Rise Again</h3>
<p>Recently, the sales of woolen fabrics have been quiet, and the sales on this street have been declining. The guest group also only sends a small number of packages. Except for general domestic households making slight collapses, there are few official business transactions. Regarding the future of the woolen fabric market, according to industry predictions, most say that it must rise again. Because the current inventory of various goods is limited, especially ordinary woolen fabrics from 6 yuan to 8 yuan, they are even more lacking. The foreign firms' spot goods have mostly been sold out long ago, and the cost of importing new goods is high. Now, the prices of Shen Weaving woolen fabrics have all increased. For example, the single-sided flannel of Hong Kang, Yong Yongxing must be priced at 6 yuan per yard (before, the zero clip was only 6 yuan). It is predicted that the zero clip in early spring will be at least 6.7-8 yuan in legal tender. Given such circumstances, it is predicted that the market price on the red board will definitely be particularly high.</p>
<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the esteemed editor:</p>
<p>I have read in your esteemed newspaper's commercial news sugar market column on the 10th of this month, "It is rumored that the products of the 明華 (Minghua) 日糖廠 (Japanese Sugar Factory) have been exclusively sold, which shows that blind people seek profit and stop at nothing. However, this should be distinguished slightly, as knowing that buying more X goods reduces one's own strength somewhat, it is inevitable to see profit and forget righteousness, and to be too lacking in national consciousness. Those who do this will isolate themselves from the people of the country." Upon reading this, I am extremely shocked. Upon investigation, all members of this association have patriotism in their hearts and will never sell X goods. This can be proven by past events. However, this matter is of great importance to the reputation of the members of this association, and I am especially afraid of confusing black and white and misleading the public. Therefore, I am sending this letter to clarify the matter, and I request that it be published. Shanghai Sugar Trade Association, February 13th.</p>

<h3>Seizing Guerrilla Areas: The Conspiracy of the Cocoon Merchants (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Sun Guang</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>From the above, we can see that the Japanese forces' control over the cocoon harvest is swift and decisive, aiming to achieve their goals. However, their implementation methods are a behind-the-scenes operation. Therefore, in addition to exposing this conspiracy and warning the people of the war zone, especially the cocoon merchants, not to be fooled, I will specifically put forward the following two countermeasures for everyone's reference:</p>
<p>The active approach is that the cocoon merchants themselves should recognize that those who are currently renting lines to collect cocoons are nothing more than running dogs of the so-called "华中蚕丝公司" (Central China Silk Company) of the Japanese side, and not legitimate Chinese merchants. After renting, not only will the rent fee not be guaranteed, but the cocoon merchants will gradually be put into the pockets of the Japanese. Moreover, the strength of the guerrillas is extremely expanding, and the cocoon merchants who rent to the Japanese may be attacked and destroyed at any time. At that time, even if the cocoon merchants are not officially seized by the Japanese, they will be destroyed by the guerrillas because they are rented to the Japanese for operation. As a result, they will not only bear the stigma of being unpatriotic but also suffer the consequences of losing both the wife and the army. In public and private, in reputation and profit, it is not worthwhile. Therefore, cocoon merchants should try their best to avoid seeing or politely refuse when they encounter such puppets renting lines, so that their plans cannot be sold. Secondly, if a cocoon merchant has been fooled, they should quickly state reasons to the lessee, such as the great strength of the local guerrillas, in order to terminate the contract. If necessary, they should even endure some small sacrifices and destroy a part of the cocoon merchant's shop front or cocoon stove as a strong basis for terminating the contract. In addition to the cocoon merchants, we also hope that nearby silkworm farmers will avoid selling cocoons to such cocoon merchants, and if necessary, reel native silk themselves and then find a way to sell it. Because after the Japanese control the cocoon merchants, the cocoon price will definitely not follow the silk price, so from an economic point of view, reeling native silk themselves can also be more profitable.</p>
<p>The passive approach is that we hope that the local guerrillas will not tolerate and will effectively destroy such cocoon merchants rented by the "华中蚕丝公司" (Central China Silk Company) using Chinese as a front when they are in operation, so that the Japanese side will also gain nothing. This is truly our national policy of resistance. Because if we still recognize ourselves as citizens of the Republic of China and know a little about "country," "nation," "self," and "enemy," no one would be willing to watch their hard-earned property be provided for the enemy to enjoy for nothing. Therefore, we not only eagerly hope that the local guerrillas will carry out this task but also hope that nearby young people with blood can assist in this destruction work. In short, for things that we cannot enjoy or use, we would rather destroy them than allow them to be used by others. In this way, the enemy's goal of aggression will never be achieved. Therefore, the destruction of this conspiracy of economic seizure and control in the war zone is indeed the most important issue in the guerrilla's destruction work and is also an excellent opportunity for the people in the war zone to serve the country.

<h3>Getting Rid of the Old and Welcoming the New</h3>
<p>— (Tsunami)</p>
<p>The New Year is truly a once-a-year happy festival. As always, when the New Year's Eve comes, everyone will unanimously become busy: sending New Year's gifts back and forth; inviting friends and partners to plan how to play and drink through the New Year. As for the tradition of getting rid of the old and welcoming the new, it is even more unavoidable. Hair must always be cut and styled anew: even if the barbershop doubles the price; the bathhouse must also go to bathe away the whole year's worth of bad luck and filth; as for clothing, it is of course especially subject to the rule of making it new. Only in this way can it be considered "ten thousand things are renewed with the sound of firecrackers" and not disappoint the arrival of this New Year. Every year, people always spend it like this, and it seems that only then can they be considered to have gotten rid of the old and welcomed the new.</p>
<p>No! This kind of renewal cannot renew anything. We must advocate thoroughly and effectively implementing a new renewal. Of course, we are not absolutely and completely abolishing the old renewal, but we must decide based on the needs of the facts. So, how do we renew the new renewal?</p>
<p>This year is still a year of resistance against Japan. Needless to say, our renewal must be adapted to the resistance against Japan. Everyone should self-reflect on whether they have contributed their due strength to the motherland in the resistance against Japan in the past year? Have they done anything wrong that is detrimental to the motherland, no matter how small it is like a fly, we must expose and review it, reform the errors we have made, and start our new progressive life in the New Year at the beginning of the year. For example, in this year, have I done my best in Shanghai's savings donation work? If not, then I must start doing my best in the New Year. For example, I can watch one less movie, drink one less glass of wine, and play mahjong one less time. Although you have saved a little, the compatriots struggling on the line of death have benefited a lot! There are really many places to get rid of the old and welcome the new. For example, have I bought and sold enemy goods? Have I ever wavered in my belief in the inevitable victory of the resistance against Japan? Have I spread rumors that confuse people? Have I done enough in the work of opposing traitors? In short, any action can be reviewed from the perspective of the overall national interest, whether it is direct or indirect. Change the wrong ones and implement the new correct ones; promote the good and progressive ones and make new efforts to them. Two</p>
<p>The general review of the year is to reveal the advantages and weaknesses in detail and frankly, otherwise, if the weaknesses are allowed to go unchecked, it will promote their expansion, and naturally, there will be no talk of renewal. The advantages cannot be ignored either. I must promote their renewal and development. Leaving aside this kind of getting rid of the old and welcoming the new is hypocritical and misleading.</p>
<p>The end of the year is approaching, everyone is preparing.</p>
<p>With the sound of the signal gun, it is the year of renewal of the resistance against Japan!</p>

<p>Newspapers—the only spiritual food that disseminates international audio-visual information and promotes world culture—are progressing rapidly in major cities and have become the most important organization in public education! It not only reports on the evolution of politics and economics but also hones a large number of cultural warriors, working hard to write and produce, and exposing the various aspects of society. Of course, even if all the newspapers on Earth disappeared, it would not cause all human activities to come to a standstill, but at least it would reduce the dynamics that are as complex as they are now, and even affect the continuous progress of the entire society!</p>
<p>Similarly, in Shanghai, the largest metropolis in the East with a population of four million, it is tightly grasping the center of the country's economy and culture, and is a key point for foreign import and export distribution. Especially the prosperity of the concessions after the opening of the international market has made Shanghai look like an international trading port. Therefore, the development of the newspaper industry here is of course thriving and taking the lead in all parts of the country! There are more than a hundred newspapers that cater to the low-level tastes of the public, and there are also a large number of major newspapers whose sales break through tens of thousands. Since Shanghai became an isolated island, although some newspapers have moved to the mainland to continue publishing, the newspaper market in Shanghai has been relatively deserted for quite a period. However, soon, in order to meet the needs of intelligence on the tense situation at home and abroad, many daily newspapers sponsored by foreign merchants became active like bamboo shoots after a rain, and the newspaper market returned to its past lively and prosperous situation. If we say that the isolated island is a huge human body, then the listing of newspapers is like an unstoppable torrent, starting from the heart, heading to their respective main quotas, merging into the blood, and following the blood vessels for rapid transportation. One by one, the movements of the human world, from the base of the newspaper market, can be brought to the eyes of every reader in a very short time, and the news and information are spread throughout every street and alley of the entire city!</p>
<p>The birthplace of Shanghai's newspaper industry—Hope Street—was originally a street where crowds gathered, but recently it is no longer the only major base. Relying on the east end of Edward Road, the standing of newspaper offices has absorbed almost more than half of the market. Whenever newspaper vendors stroll on this street in the early morning and evening, from a distance, they look like an agitated beehive, densely shaking and waiting for the fresh newspapers to be loaded from the newspaper office! In the early morning when the morning light is slightly shining, the newspaper market has already begun to be active! Soon, like a tide, it spread in all directions, and with the enthusiastic shouts of newspapers, it filled the quiet space.</p>
<p>The night market of newspapers after the war has made rapid progress. Currently, many daily newspapers have evening editions, but there are slight differences in the publication time, so that the night market starts from three or four o'clock in the afternoon and even extends into the late night! If there is special news, even in the deeper hours of midnight, it is possible to have a small 32-open extra, which is guaranteed to be snatched up. Because the night newspaper publishes mostly the news of the day, it is very much to the readers' taste! With the mysterious night life of the metropolis, the newspaper market is also relatively the longest and most intense! In fact, from dawn to midnight, the newspaper market is constantly supporting the market, but it is even more crowded at the moment of publishing the newspaper!</p>
<p>The newspaper market is the lifeline of the metropolis. It has all the supreme authority. It can stimulate people's minds and generate feelings of excitement and frustration from different standpoints. It never stops and is active day and night in the glorious heart of the city!</p>
<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>To all contributors:</p>
<p>The manuscript fees for January have been settled. Please bring a receipt with a seal and collect it from the accounting department of this building in the afternoon of the 15th, 16th, and 17th. Spring and Autumn Editorial Office</p>
<h3>In the Office</h3>
<p>— Quere</p>
<p>The office here is not the office of a compradore or clerk in a foreign firm. This is the office of a small school that educates children, which Ellen Poe called "the 20th century is the century of children." That's right, "the 20th century is the century of children," but this "century of children" is also showing the breath of gunpowder full of invaders' artillery fire in this small and very simple "office."</p>
<p>Because today is the first day of school, some of the teachers are wearing old student uniforms, and some are wearing thick, fat old cloth cotton jackets. The female teachers are wearing indigo blue cloth robes with a half-old, half-new velvet hair rope shirt. Although the clothes are not very good, their hair has all been newly styled. They are busy like this, receiving the parents of the children.</p>
<p>Their courteous reception is very respectful, which makes people think of the waiters in hotels. However, this is a common phenomenon in the so-called "private primary schools" in Shanghai, which are known as "alleyway schools." This phenomenon, in the eyes of others, is a bit humble, but in the eyes of people like me who have been primary school teachers, it feels like a knife is cutting the heart! —China's "primary school teachers"! ….</p>
<p>"War" has caused extreme panic in Shanghai's "alleyway primary schools," but "war" has also brought temporary prosperity to Shanghai's "alleyway primary schools." However, in this prosperity, there is also a tragic picture of "war"! This "tragic picture" was successfully painted by the brutal invaders with the blood of our Chinese compatriots!</p>
<p>An old "old gentleman" wearing a pair of old-fashioned glasses is sitting upright in an old rattan chair. On the desk in front of him, which has faded from "Polish," is a large inkstone, a pen rack, an abacus, and some things that must be used on the "desk," such as a kettle and paste. The "old gentleman" is probably the principal of this small school. He is quietly dealing with the parents who are surrounding the four sides of the "desk." His right hand is holding ten writing brushes, and his left hand is pressing on a tuition receipt book that has not been written on a few pages.</p>
<p>"Old gentleman! Can you reduce it a little? Really, we escaped from the war, and his father has no business, but the children can't not study! Alas, old gentleman! Just reduce it a little! ……" These were the words of an old woman in her sixties. On her left is a child of about ten years old, whose eyes are not agilely flashing on his thin face, but staring blankly at the old gentleman.</p>
<p>The old gentleman frowned and was about to speak, but another young woman opened her mouth in a hard Ningbo dialect:</p>
<p>"Old gentleman! Like us, since the war, his father has been very lucky not to lose his business! Now, the salary is discounted! So, I also want to ask the old gentleman to reduce the tuition a little"!</p>
<p>Another "old man" parent swallowed his saliva and tremblingly opened his mouth to speak:</p>
<p>"Yes, old gentleman! Who is not embarrassed at this time? I can only ask the old gentleman to reduce our burden for the sake of popularizing education! Alas! If the children are put outside, they will really be spoiled! ……"</p>
<p>The old gentleman's frown became tighter and tighter. He looked around and saw that there were many parents sending their children to school in the "office." He felt very embarrassed. If he agreed, this example could not be opened! If he did not agree, if the students really did not come to study because of this, wouldn't he lose them one by one? He shook his head, but he always said:</p>
<p>"This is impossible no matter what! However, this, yes, …"</p>
<p>The "old gentleman" finally couldn't go on. So, a few other teachers came to greet those parents who wanted to reduce the fees to another classroom, which was considered to have relieved the "old gentleman" of a difficult situation.</p>
<p>Look! Here is the tragic taste of an alleyway primary school"; here is our next generation, whose education is facing difficulties due to the invaders' artillery fire!</p>
<p>How to save these children?</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky is Clear</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 4: Recalling the Past, Letian Speaks Witty Words; Forging New Friendships, Scenic Spots Make a Pleasant Trip</p>
<p>Wu Junsu smiled and said, "Your husband guessed right. Those two sisters are both named He. They are sisters." Wu Junsu didn't want to tell them that they were twins. She saw that the one surnamed Zhao was about forty years old and had a purplish-red face. Although he only had one leg, he was very energetic. And he was an optimist, always smiling and liking to say a few witty words. Wu Junsu was also a naughty girl. She said, "Does your husband feel any inconvenience with only one leg?" The one surnamed Zhao, his name was Letian. This name, I don't know if it was this name from the beginning, or if it was given later, in short, that name couldn't be more fitting to his personality. At that time, Zhao Letian said, "Why do you say I only have one leg? I have three legs, one more than others." As he said, he took his two crutches and showed them to them, "These are two legs, plus my own original leg, isn't that three legs? Say it's inconvenient? I don't have any inconvenience at all. If you don't believe me, one day, I'll come and race you, I'm afraid you ladies won't be able to beat me." He Liyu said at this time, "I have a friend in a foreign country who also has one leg. He later installed an artificial leg. You can't see it at all, and the way he walks is the same as ordinary people. Why doesn't your husband install an artificial leg?" Zhao Letian said, "Artificial leg? Yes! Yes! Now we Chinese can also manufacture it ourselves. There is a company in Shanghai called the Yipin Company, which specializes in making artificial hands and feet. Not only are there artificial hands and artificial feet, but everything else, such as artificial eyes, artificial ears, and artificial noses, can be made. Because the word '假' (false) doesn't sound good, it has been changed to the word '义' (righteous). For example, artificial hands and feet have been renamed righteous hands and righteous feet, and in addition to righteous eyes and righteous ears, everything is righteous and not unrighteous. So, the name of the company that manufactures those artificial limbs and artificial organs is called Yipin Company. In fact! One's own is always real, and the artificial one is always fake. If you make a fake one, you have to think of a good name. What righteous or unrighteous? It's just using the fake to confuse the real. The year before last, the Central Hospital wanted to install an artificial leg for me. I felt that installing it was uncomfortable. Moreover, I am a rough person, and if I am not careful, the leg will leave me and run away by itself. Installing it is just for show, to deceive people that I am not a one-legged person, but I am also considered a two-legged person. But I feel that this is not very free, and I have to be careful of it. And I think to myself: people who know me know that I am a one-legged person, and I can't deceive him. People who don't know me, seeing two legs, what is so strange about that?" (40)</p>
