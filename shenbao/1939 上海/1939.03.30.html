<p>社評</p>
<h3>謹防又一和平烟幕</h3>
<p>日昨美聯社倫敦電訉，英外相哈里法克斯於接見中國駐英大使郭泰祺時，曾商討遠東問題。據傳英外相表示近因德國勢力的膨脹，英法將無暇東顧。同時又謂英國駐日大使克萊琪，與英國駐華大使寇爾，將在上海舉行會議的問題，也被一般人所重視。我們知道，過去日本每向一中國重要城市進攻時，國際間必定有一種和平或類似和平的消息相呼應。這種消息的產生，如果不是由於少數國際人士對於中國抗戰的認識不足，那就一定是日本利用各國外交官吏的行動，而施放一種烟慕的詭計，以謀間接達到其「求和」的目的。目前中日兩軍正在南昌激戰的時候，倫敦居然又傳出英法無暇東顧，和英國駐日駐華兩大使有所會議的離奇消息，自然毫不足奇。現在我們敢為國際人士正吿的：這次中國的抗戰，乃是全國民族生存的要求，無論國際間的變化如何，非獲得最後的勝利，是決不停止的。以中國人力物力的豐富，和世界各國同情的援助，縱使歐洲發生巨變，致一二友邦不能兼顧遠東問題，也不足以影響到中國抗戰的前途；便是一二重要城市，繼續遭受淪陷，也早已認為是初期抗戰過程中所不可免的現象，決不足以影響全局，並挫折中國全國軍民抗戰的決心的。</p>
<p>國際人士如果顧慮歐洲有事不能東顧，要促令中國「早自為計」，他們就根本不認識世界和平之不能分立。中國何嘗不是世界的一環！在近數年來，歐亞法西斯的侵略陣綫下，中國的抗戰固然是為着本身的生存和獨立，同時却也是為着歐洲甚至於世界的和平與安全。假如現在歐洲各民治國，為要挽救歐洲法西斯所造成的歐洲危機，反而要聽令中國受亞洲法西斯勢力的侵略宰割，那非獨不合正義人道，並且她們自己也要感受禍害。因為重視歐洲局勢而放棄遠東；或為集中歐洲民治陣綫力量，而暫時在遠東謀取妥協；或以妥協的態度，暗示希望歐亞法西斯於「適可而止」的狀態下，暫時維持歐亞兩洲的和平，這都是極錯誤的政策，很容易墮入法西斯所設置的陷阱，更增加民治國家的危機的。</p>
<p>法西斯的侵略行動，事實上是毫無止境的；歐洲希特拉所提出的最後的領土要求，已經是一而再，再而三了。亞洲的日本何嘗不是一樣！就以最近的情形而論，不久以前日本曾宣稱卽將開放靑島，准許第三方面船舶停泊外港。日本聲明這是她饜滿第三方面願望的眞正的努力，倫敦方面對此消息也表示非常歡迎。其實這祗是日本的一點口惠。這點口惠是否能夠實現，當然還是問題。縱使能夠實現，對於第三方面能饜滿到怎樣的程度，也很値得考慮。日本過去曾向歐美各國保證尊重在華權益，可是事實上的表現如何？在過去二十個月的中日戰爭中，那一天沒有第三方面的權益未被日本破壞？有人以德國在慕尼黑協定中所提出的保證，其價値不及購買簽訂協定的紙費。日本這種的口惠，當然更遠不如！</p>
<p>退一步說，縱使日本這種的口惠能夠實現，但在日本的武力統制下，所謂靑島開放，對於第三方面的利益，實在也是有限得很：日本在她的佔領區域內，已將金融貨幣貿易以及交通建設等事業，完全施以統制，第三方面的船舶除了可以在靑島外港停泊之外，再無其他利益可尋。並且日本這種的口惠，說出時雖不容易，要取消時也不困難。昨報載日本將再度封鎖珠江交通，僅准許日輪自由來往，便是一個顯例。日本這種吃肉吐骨的施惠政策，諒來一般具有遠大眼光的政洽家，絕不輕易為其所惑。</p>
<p>現在日本對於所謂饜滿第三方面願望的眞正努力，還沒有實際的表示，而加緊排斥第三方面在華勢力的工作，却早已有實際的行動。上海蘇州河北的租界，最近已被上海日本發言人認為日軍的佔領區域，這顯然是日本開始否認外人在華租界的存在。又據日昨大陸報載，南京偽「維新政府」已開始實施極強烈的排外運動，並且公然提出撕毀英國國旗，對英經濟絕交，沒收英國在華財產，收回一切英國租界，驅逐國內一切英人，不與英人合作等口號，傀儡這種行動，實際上自是日本的鬼計。日本一方面略施口惠，表示其侵略行動的緩進；另一方面却又指使傀儡積極從事根除外人在華權益的工作。她利用各民治國家不承認偽組織的關係，自己則站在不干涉偽組織的立塲，使歐美各民治國家對於在華權益的喪失，連抗議的機會也無從獲得，自然更談不到什麼保證安全。這是多麼毒辣的一種侵略手段！</p>
<p>世界各民治國家要遏止法西斯的侵略，任何妥協退讓政策已不復能發生效力，對於中國抗戰過程中幾個重要據點的喪失，又何足以影響整個的大局！惟有一致聯合起來「予打擊者以打擊」才能保持整個世界的和平。</p>

<h3>蘇日漁約糾紛的檢討　一般認日本勢將軟化</h3>
<p>蘇日關係，原來是一部對立抗爭的歷史，近數年來因爲日本，強佔了我東北四省，爲了邊境問題，更是糾紛時起，對於日蘇的戰爭是否發生，已爲世人時刻關心的問題了。自從去年八月張鼓峯事件吿一結束之後，二國緊張的關係，雖然一時趨於緩和，但是最近因爲漁約改定問題，二國的關係又是劍拔弩張，大有一觸即發之勢</p>
<p>漁約溯源</p>
<p>我們在說蘇日漁約糾紛之前，必須先說一說漁約問題發生的起源。蘇日漁業條約，是一九〇五年日俄戰爭後，根據樸茅資斯和約第十一條第一項一俄國爲許日本國臣民，瀕於日本海，鄂　次克海及白林海，俄國領地沿岸的漁業權，得與日本國締結協定一的規定，於一九〇七年正式成立的。因爲這個條約的簽訂俄國就把以上領海的漁業權讓與日本，而日本也從此漸漸的建立起他在北洋的水產事業，這個漁業權的獲得，眞如日本人所說，是由血液換來的。當時帝俄的所以把上述領海的漁業權讓與日本，戰爭失敗當然是一個重要的原因，同時那時帝俄在遠東自己尚無漁業經營，亦不無關係，日本人以爲從那時以後，北洋的漁業，是日本、永久不變的國權，實際上俄人何曾不認爲這是他們的恥辱，只因日俄戰爭之後，俄國總是忙於內亂與革命，因而無暇顧及此遠東漁業權利罷了。最初成立的漁約，原定以上二年爲期，於一九一九年期滿，但是那時俄國剛在革命之後，蘇維埃政府成立不久，無暇與日本談判改訂，於是就在無條約的狀態下，日本由軍艦保護，在蘇聯遠東領海自山捕魚。一直到一九二五年一月蘇日恢復邦交，於是才開始談判修改漁約間題。其間經過許多困難曲折，歷時二年餘，才於一九二八年，在北京成立了有名的所謂蘇日基本漁約，重新劃定了日本租用的漁塲。條約有效時期爲八年，但是，這一經過很多波折方成立的基本漁約，實施之後，二國間仍發生了很多的料紛。向來不顧國際信義慣於破壞國際條約的日本，對於此次的漁約，實未曾遵守，一九二九年因爲參加漁塲投標失敗，竟不顧約中限制而自由捕魚。同時在蘇聯方面，因爲國內革命的紛亂漸次平息，自一九二七年起已建立了所謂國營漁業建設十年計劃，積極的進行遠東漁業開發，與蘇聯的國營事業競爭，日本個人企業的處於不利地位常然是不可掩的事實。自一九〇七年漁約最初成立以來，日本所有的漁區，向來與蘇聯保持八與二之比，但是到了一九二九年，蘇聯的漁區，是很快的增加而有日本的一半以上，到一九三六年，終至於趨過了日本的漁區數目。像這樣發展下去，日本的漁區，有很快的被蘇聯完全收回的可能。但後經一九三二年由當時日本駐蘇大使廣田弘毅與加拉罕交涉，成立了所謂安定漁區協定，對於當時日本所租借的大部分漁區，可以不經投標競賣而取得。那時日本共有漁區三百九十二，其中因安定漁區協定的締結，不致受投標的影響而落選，屬於所謂安定漁區的，共計二百八十二漁區，此外有附罐頭製造工廠的所謂特別契約漁區，數目有四十四，糾紛時起的漁業問題，終算暫時的獲得解決。</p>
<p>引起糾紛</p>
<p>但是歲月如流九三六年，漁業契約的八年期限滿了，於是蘇日雙方由卞資羅夫斯基與酒匈在莫斯科進行漁業條約改定的談判，最後，得到了協定案，並定於十一月二十日正式簽字，其大綱如後：（一）漁業條約有效期延長八年，（二）廣田加拉罕所訂安定漁區長期租借，（三）特別契約漁區延長八年，（四）維持每盧布合三十二錢五厘的換算率，（五）維待漁族資源，這個協定案所以能夠成立，完全由於蘇聯的讓步，和顧全大局的苦心。漁業條約有效期間延長八年，安定漁區的長期保證租借，固不必說，就是盧布換算率，蘇方因日本幣值的屢行減低，會要求提高五元，亦未實行。但是日本一方面與蘇聯談判漁權租借，一方面却與德國商訂以反蘇為目的的所謂防共協定，擬定於十一月二十日漁業改訂條約簽定之後，五天即十二月二十五日訂立。他的用意，是想在漁的簽了字，漁權確切把握之後，再與德國簽訂反共協定，使蘇聯無可如何，可是策謀欠秘密，在漁約正式簽字之前，日德協定，防共協定的消息，已爲蘇聯所探悉了。於是蘇聯的態度驟趨硬化，以國內的手續尚未辦妥爲口實，拒絕簽字。日本與德簽訂防共協定，不必說是仇視蘇聯，而以蘇聯爲敵，蘇聯當然沒有把他的權益讓與敵人的必要，結果已滿期的漁業條約，全部延長了一年，締結了暫時協定，以爲一時的解決。一年易過，到了一九三七年，又是締結了暫時協定過去了。可是到了去年年底，蘇聯對於漁業條約的改訂，固取迥避的態度，就是暫時協定，亦不肯締結，而且表示一切條約期滿之後，就是安定漁區亦包含在內，將其投標競賣。漁區既是蘇聯所領有的，契約期滿之後，蘇聯當然有權收回，但日本每以樸資茅斯條約爲根據，認爲北洋捕漁，已是日本水久的國權了。對於這一點蘇聯的外交人民委員會早已指出，樸資茅斯條約，早已被日本破壞了，日本漁業權亦不復能以此約爲根據。因爲樸資茅斯條約中規定，日本不得在「滿洲」駐兵，並且沿鐵道的護路隊，每公里不能超過十五名，但是九一八事變之後，日本却在東北四省長久駐紮大軍。同時在樸資茅斯條約中，日本承認不在庫頁島及附近島嶼建築要塞或軍事建築物，並在宗谷海峽，不妨碍蘇聯船隻的航行自由，與建立軍事地帶，但最近日本已有在此等地方建築軍事工事的事實，此外中東鐵道來期價款五，九八一，六二五日元，付款期限早已過去了，雖疉經蘇聯政府催促，日本至今尚未履行擔保責任。日本政府本身旣不履行其對於蘇聯之義務，而其對於蘇聯，不僅要其履行義務，並且要蘇聯滿足日本在此項義務以外的要求。日本政府此種蠻橫無理的要求，當然不是蘇聯政府所能容忍的。所以蘇聯方面，認爲日本如要開始新的長期漁業條約的談判，至少須將中東路付款一項義務切實履行。爲償付價款的進行，及完成新漁約時開上的須要，並爲證明日本的善意起見，準備以下列的基本條件，重行締結以一年爲期的暫時漁約，其條件爲：（一）租界期滿的漁區，連從前的安定漁區在內，全部投標競賣。（二）有四十漁區，爲軍略與漁業保護的關係，以後不能讓與日人使用。（三）特別契約漁區得延長一年。在蘇聯的立塲說，這些條件已經很讓步，但在日本人看來，實在還覺得難於接受，所以自去年到現在，雖經東鄉與李維諾夫多次的談判，結果終於未曾成功。</p>
<p>前途預測</p>
<p>如果依據蘇聯的條件，把大部分的漁區投標競賣，則日本的私人企業要與蘇聯的國營企業競爭，當然是極不容易，結果日本的北洋漁業，必然要完全潰滅。以日本在蘇領漁區的生產額說雖然不過佔日本全國水產總生產額的百分之四或六，但是共中主要的生產物，爲罐頭鮭魚蒪魚及鹹魚與罐頭蟹的製造額，差不多全部輸出於英美市塲，每年達三千萬元左右，與日本的總貿易額比較，這數目雖不大，但是此項國際收入，與須輸入原料，經過製造後，再行輸出的商品不同，對於調整國際收支上關係很大。同時捕漁的勞動者，都是日本東北北海道樺太等地方的小農民人數在二萬左右，每年總收入達四百萬餘元，對於貧苦的東北農村也頗有帮助，如果北洋蘇領漁業潰滅，則對於日本的經濟與社會，都將發生很大的影響，所以日本對於漁約甚爲重視，漁約的不能簽訂甚感恐慌。在此日方不以妥善的方法，去尋求合理的解決，而竟以更兇惡的手段，來對付蘇聯決定於三月十五日漁區投標競賣時不去參加，並於五月漁汛時期，預備以軍艦保護實行自由捕漁。但是今日蘇領遠東海岸，已不如以往一稱毫無防備，可以自由捕魚，現在蘇聯的遠東領土與領海上，早已秘密建有軍事設備，如果日本以軍艦保護實行自由捕漁，則其情勢之嚴重，當然可想而知。據說蘇聯以海參崴爲中心，沿岸建築有六個軍事根據地，並配置有一百數十艘的潛水艦，而且近來，自列寗格拉至北冰洋的不凍港莫孟斯克與遠東的彼得羅巴伐洛甫斯克及海參威的北冰洋航路，已經開通，從歐蘇到遠東的距離已經縮短，同時並努力於絕對安全，航路的開拓，亦可見蘇聯對於軍事準備，早已胸有成竹。據二月八日海通社東京電訊所傳，蘇聯在海參威已成立一軍事委員會，由遠東艦隊司令任主席，除遠東艦隊外，尚有陸軍兩帥歸其指揮，該委員會並已訓令所屬如在領海內發現日本漁船時，當即開砲轟擊，路透電亦傳駐日蘇聯大使館，原有職員十四人，現因二國關係惡化，已僅餘代辦史末丹寗與二等秘書安那羅夫二人，而史來丹寗最近亦將返國。加里寗早巳說過：「蘇聯不畏日本及其他侵略國家，若帝國主義者仍不覺悟，則蘇聯將予以較張高峯更大的打擊。」目前的蘇日關係，當然已是十分嚴重，不過蘇聯在遠東鋻軍，完全是防備侵略者的挑　，本並不是攻勢的軍備，同時日本的強硬，常常只是一種威脅的姿態，此次日本的所以敢作武裝自捕魚的表示，實在因爲歐洲民主國家的讓步，至使西方侵略者得寸進步的發展，於是日本也裝腔作勢，一方面想以漁業問題，作進攻蘇聯的姿態，以博取德意的歡心，同時又在海南島登陸，以遠東的緊張形勢，牽制英法，以壯德意殖民地需求的聲勢。但是日本在對華作戰上，已是疲弊不堪，世人早已知道他的色厲內荏，決無力量再與第三國作戰，而蘇聯也絕無對日挑戰之意，但亦決不是日本所能威嚇，所以我們認爲日本最後，將會如張高峯事件一樣趨於軟化，以妥協的方法求得一暫時的解決，結果大槪是東方的侵略者，再在世人的眼前丟一次臉吧</p>

<h3>曾仲鳴被刺詳情　汪曾寓所懂一牆之隔</h3>
<p>河內航訊、汪兆銘秘書曾仲鳴、在河內窩所被刺殞命、其經過情形如次、</p>
<p>寓所一瞥</p>
<p>曾追隨在氏、來河內寓居、經有數月、初與汪同寓京都大酒店、後乃移居哥隆街某號之洋樓、遷入亦逾月、最近汪對友人曾言欲赴歐洲一遊、曾亦準備隨往、不期正於此時、竟發生慘事、哥隆街三樓、原爲福建人郭鍠鏢產業、屋前有鐵欄圍繞、欄內有小庭園、園內兩屋相運、高三層、建築頗爲美觀、屋內地下爲工人住所、二樓爲會客廳餐廳等、三樓則爲住室、兩屋佈置大同小異、汪氏自居一間、其餘一間則爲曾氏夫婦及其家人居住、曾之女最近由重慶來、亦同居　此、慘案即於曾氏所居之三樓發生、</p>
<p>被刺情形</p>
<p>本月二十一日凌晨二時三十分左右、有靑年五六人、從屋外之鐵柵爬入庭院、潛入屋內、直上曾氏所居之三樓、將曾之臥室房門打開、即開槍向曾夫婦所睡之牀連轟二三十發、計被刺受傷者共五人、曾仲嗚胸腿部中四彈、傷勢極重、曾妻方君璧被槍彈擦過腹部及中腿部、尚有三人因營救亦受微傷、一爲蔡然成、一爲何靜、一則不知姓名、鄰里當時為槍聲驚醒、只以爲放鞭砲、未予理會、迨事發後、其家人即以電話通知羅傘街中央警署、立派大批警探四出兜截刺客、當塲截獲嫌疑人四名、帶返驚署訊究、</p>
<p>醫治無效</p>
<p>當樓上槍聲亂響時、樓下之工人、均蟄伏不敢稍動、俟兇徒去後、始敢上樓、曾氏受傷最重、是時已奄奄一息、乃卽請鄰居之醫生馮某到塲救治、打針止痛、仍不見效、乃以汽車將曾氏及其妻舁往陸軍翳院救治、診治結果、認曾氏彈中要害、無力挽救、延至是日下午四時半即在該院斃命、其妻傷勢則無大碍、警探事後將全屋勘視、拾得細號高爾式六響手槍二枝、拿獲之兇手四人、二十二日卽在警局開始初步審訊、據供、此舉純屬愛國行動、目的原在刺殺汪兆銘、因錯入房間、故誤刺曾氏云云、查汪氏所居只隔一牆、外觀實爲一屋、</p>
<h3>血戰兩晝夜　華軍再克大橋</h3>
<p>沿江邊區弦歌不輟</p>
<p>江都通訊、日人企圖囊括蘇北、運河沿岸戰事方股之際、記者爲欲明瞭蘇北沿江邊區一帶游擊軍抗戰之實況、特赴大橋·口岸·高橋·諸要鎮、作</p>
<p>實地視察</p>
<p>實地視察該各地以濱江之故、曾迭受日人之跺躪、地方元氣大傷、唯自經游擊軍司令方鈞率部收復之後、情勢日漸好轉、居民雖時受日艦砲火之威脅、而能刻苦勞作、對於抗戰情緒激昂、記者曾訪謁方鈞司令、方年壯英俊、新膺軍事委員會陸軍中將兼長江邊區游擊司令、但熊度謙和、戎裝樸質、與記者握手後、曾詳告最近與日軍作戰之情形、據謂本人担任之</p>
<p>作戰區域</p>
<p>作戰區域爲揚中口岸等沿江十數縣鎮、地位衝要、日軍屢圖北犯、而有所顧慮者、卽恐吾等之掣肘也、自本人駐防以來、與日軍發生遭遇戰、約四十餘次、日軍因時遭創痛、犯我益急、於旬前、得漢奸密報、探出我司令部之所在地、竟大舉來犯、由日人某隊長率領七百餘入、攜帶野重武器、分三路</p>
<p>猛撲大橋</p>
<p>時本人左右僅百餘人、猝不及防惟有奮勇抵抗、激戰兩小時後、我以寡衆懸殊、且戰且却、部隊卽四散潛伏土溝之中、日方企圖一鼓殱滅、不惜以大量彈藥肆意轟擊、但均漫無目標、砲擊至晚始稍止、我乘其稍懈、復出突擊、次晨我援軍開到、乃</p>

<h3>林柏生被擊傷案　陳錫林處刑十五年　醫言林之右眼勢難復原</h3>
<p>香港通訊、林柏生月前在德輔道被人狙擊受傷當塲拘獲兇手陳錫林一名、俟上月間林氏傷愈出院、即由香港初級法院提審、主審法官以案情重大經過極詳盡之調查、始於十八日再開刑庭提審被吿、因被吿陳錫林依然矢口否認曾持鐵尺狙擊林柏生、乃又延期至二十二日下午、再召同陪審員及原吿證人等審訊、常第三度</p>
<p>公開審判</p>
<p>時、被吿仍極端否認行兇、而原吿林柏生、則偕其辯護律師施路華親自到庭、當時林着藍綢棉袍、持司的克、惟其右眼創傷未痊　掩以眼罩、開庭後、法官控兇手陳錫林以下列二罪、（一）本年一月一日在德輔道中擊傷林柏生　意圖謀殺、（二）在上列地點擊傷林柏生、意圖殘廢林柏生肢體、而港政府亦由政府律師二人出面主控、當由二政府律師先對法官申述林柏生被</p>
<p>狙擊經過</p>
<p>繼由太平洋行洋酒部司理羅拔臣作證、謂當日五時渠公畢出門、親見被吿持鐵錘連擊林氏三次、其力甚重、羅氏見此情形、喝令停止、被吿聞聲棄錘逃遁、羅乃追趕、斯時被吿向西南方走、至連卡佛公司附近之橫巷時、似有躊躇不決之狀、是時適有一軍醫隊隊員迎面而來、遂將被告執獲、帶返肇事地點、及至</p>
<p>警察到場</p>
<p>始將被吿交與警察、至此再由瑪利利醫院醫生出而作證、所述與前相同、遂又由警局帮辦謂、當被吿拘送警署時、渠曾向之盤詁云、「傷　係何許人」、被吿答稱、「林柏生」、繼又詢其爲何將林狙擊、被告即謂「我不欲講」、於是法官即謂依林之傷勢及各證人所供、顯見被吿之狙擊林氏、實爲有意、故無論此種狙擊之起囚有無收治意味、抑純爲私人的仇怨、其舉動顯有謀殺之態度、法官中述完畢、即由瑪利需院醫生登臺作供稱</p>
<p>林之右眼</p>
<p>將永遠受擊傷影響、於是再由原吿林柏生供述當時情形　供畢、被吿陳錫林辯曰、「當日下午四時牛、余在馬利兵房工畢、向西行至中天行時、遠聞人聲嘈雜、並見行人塵集、觀者如堵、余以爲發生何種意外事件、乃即前往一看、是時圍觀者益衆、余無法望見何人受傷、旋余向連卡佛公司而行、忽被一西人所執、並將余拘往肇事地點、余實不知因何被捕」云、據由被告陳錫林之證人林九供稱、「余寓山東街二十九號四樓、與披吿同在馬利兵房工作、當日彼於四時半放工、余則五時後方始工畢」、至是、法官遂向各陪審員</p>
<p>剖釋案情</p>
<p>各陪審員退庭會商約十分鐘、終以六比一之數剁定被吿陳錫林有罪、當由法官當庭對陳錫林曰、「今陪審員判定汝犯第一款之罪、但汝仍算僥倖、茍、　日林柏生不得其毡帽以作抵禦狙擊、則必不保共生命、此時汝將犯謀殺罪矣」、言畢、即判陳錫林以徒刑十五年、一塲狙擊案、至是遂吿一段落、</p>
<h3>新四軍一年來　抗戰經騐與敎訓（三）</h3>
<p>— 項英</p>
<p>（三）敵人進政武漢主要是靠着海軍，空軍，和陸軍的配合，不是完全依靠着陸軍，而是靠着海軍掩護陸軍向武漢進攻，那末，長江這一綫是它前進的交通綫，所以日寇爲了便於接濟前方，輪送兵力，這樣不得不把長江交通的威脅除去，不得不來一個反攻，這就是說在第二階段由於我們的進攻，使敵人進行反攻，原因有這二個。</p>
<p>但是敵人這個反攻，是防禦性的反攻，用反攻達到它防禦的目的，想驅逐在京滬綫上京杭綫上以及在南京周圍所有我們的軍隊，以保障他們的安全。所以進攻不是大規模的，和戰綫上的進攻，譬如在皖南的進攻，也是一種防禦的攻勢，主要的目的是在維持長江交通，因爲長江的交通靠船隻，我們以前組織了很多的流動船隻團，使它的運輸不得順暢，使它不得不驅使江南的軍隊來維護它的交通。從整個上來說，敵人的反攻，還是防禦的攻勢，這一點我們要分淸楚。</p>
<p>我們從那裏看出敵人的進攻呢？從整個江南戰爭的形勢來看，敵人現在進攻有三個中心，在皖南以靑陽爲中心，在江南一個以茅山爲中心，一個以南京與丹陽間的小丹陽爲中心，這三個中心，也可說是我軍作戰的據點，與友軍作戰的基點。</p>
<p>在皖南敵人從九月到十二月先後佔領貴池，銅陵，繁昌，以至最近進攻靑陽。在江南說，敵人九月十日五路進攻寶堰，十二日分三路進攻蔣野橋，十五日父分兩路進攻，一路進攻上興埠，一路進攻上沛，溧水，十月七日又分兩路進攻，一路進攻新王莊，一路進攻北鎮，放火燒茅山，十月廿四日，五路進攻句容以北地區，十一月十日敵又進攻蔣野橋，十一月卅日五路進攻延陵，一直從九月起，敵人不斷的進攻我們基點。九月底延陸，黃池，烏溪，靑小鎮十月十二日以後敵人分四路進攻小丹陽，十一月十三日進攻霍里，以及最近十二月廿一日進攻朱門。十月十七日敵人分兩路進攻紅錫鎮，十一月卅日分三路以猛力來犯靑弋江等地。在皖南以靑陽爲中心，在江南以茅山及小丹陽爲中心，敵人的進攻主要的是想使我們不能在此地立足，使我們被逼離開這個地區，因爲這三個地方都是我們戰略的據點，這樣的可以使他們達到威脅的除掉，交通的安全。</p>
<p>總括起來說，在江市從六月十八日起到十二月卅一日止，這一個期問的作戰，可分爲兩個階段，第一個階段是我們進攻的時期，第二個階段，則因爲我軍的進攻，敵人不得不採取防禦的攻勢，造成了敵人反攻的形成。</p>
<p>第二，從江南作戰開始，我們總共打了多少次仗呢？總結起來，我們從這六個半月到七個月的期間，江北，江南，總共經過了二百卅四次的戰鬥，在這二百卅四次戰鬥中間，在江南的戰鬥佔了二百次，可以說我們的戰鬥，主要的是在江南打的。</p>
<p>第三，我們的戰鬥得到了些什麽呢？我想把它作成一個表冊。在二百卅四次的戰鬥中，繳獲了一千五百三十九枝步馬槍，卅二挺輕機關槍，四挺重機關槍，四十八枝駁殼槍，二十枝手槍日本錢大概有兩萬二千七百卅八圓，文件，大衣，旗子，和其它軍用品是不勝枚舉的。（統計表略）除了這些在戰鬥中的繳獲品外，同時擊毀了敵人一百九十五輛汽車，破壞了九十五座橋樑，公路，鐵路的破壞另有一個統計。（統計表略）在這六個半月至七個月的期間，敵，我傷亡的比例是怎樣的呢？在這期間，我軍共傷亡了六百六十四人，敵人傷亡了三千二百卅二人，在　敵，我對比上觀，是一與四，七之比，也可以說，我們一個人抵它四個半人，這在抗戰中是最合算的了。以過去我們軍隊抗戰來說，在陣地中敵我傷亡的比例是我傷亡三，五個敵人傷亡一個，在第二期第三期才減低爲二，五與一之比。游擊戰就正相反，我們死傷一個人，敵人就要死傷四個半，積小勝利便成一個大數目。在這六個半月至七個月的經驗中，可以充分看出游擊戰爭在中國抗戰中是對我有利的。（未完）</p>

<p>外　棉市價、紐約棉市殊爲靜寂、晨初先因利物浦電吿疲乏而跌、續因海外棉市賣出、各同業均抱觀望、華盛頓方面對於棉花生產過剩、及貸款棉之處置問題、集各地棉業領袖商討巳有月餘、實因此項問題之過於嚴重、一時不易商得善策也、事實上政府除非放出貸款棉獎勵棉花之輸出、及給以出口津貼、以貼補棉商之損失外、別無他法、咋日美總統羅斯福發表談話、亦擬撥給棉花出口津貼、唯津貼之數額及其價值則暫不允發表、昨日紐約跌二三磅音、印度昨日不動、埃及跌二十磅音、昨日滙兌平穩、折合法幣棉價俱跌、計美棉及巴西棉每担跌三角、印度不動、埃及棉跌一元餘、</p>
<p>滬　市外棉交易，依然靜寂如恒、各廠均對海外棉市作觀望態度、大衆意見、美棉看跌、昨日各廠均無交易、唯申新爲應酬某新開之印商洋行計、訂購可紡十六支之印棉奧默拉一千件、合送廠價爲六十九元、茲將咋日外棉市價分錄於後、</p>
<p>本　棉生意仍屬平淡、但較上日爲多、永安廠對於粗紗原料　進胃較暢、故售價不鬆、與前日價一樣、惟通州花邇來蘇北一路來源爽快、而廠方因紗銷不暢、辦胃尚滯、稍帶軟勢、比上日價再落二角、但存貨不厚、各廠購訂印棉需用有感不適之苦也、茲據某處消息、姚衣抵滬後、又有兩船被阻、現在正與前途交涉、是否放行、尚屬問題也、碼頭到通州細絨花一千五百三十九包、浙棉亦到五千六百包、茲將現棉售開情形錄左、</p>
<p>又　訊最近以來、華廠向海外訂購之印度棉、業已絡續抵滬解廠應用、茲據各廠試驗結果、因其顏色既黝黃而覺乾枯異常、籽屑損耗太多、對於成本方面殊不合算、紡織工作尤感困難、製成之品較次、又碍銷路、故非採辦華棉攙和不可、則製造之紗色澤當可鮮艷、足以應付社曾之需要云、</p>
<h3>工商談助　布廠原料問題</h3>
<p>— 龍駒生</p>
<p>說也痛心，上海特區裹的新舊小布廠，顯着畸形的特殊繁榮，可是這畸形的繁榮，却包含着毒素的糖衣，究其原料，都是來路不明，乾脆說一句，大多爲日貨而已！</p>
<p>我們知道：中國紗與日紗的價值，相差很鉅，就以廿支紗作例子，中國紗每件，須四百元左右，而日紗只須三百六·七十元，以每件紗四百二十磅計算，每磅要相差到國幣一角上下，有的細紗，或竟相差到二角一磅，捨貴取賤，是減輕布疋成本，增加厚利的發財捷徑！譬如織十二磅重細平布一疋，除去漿紛一磅，約需純紗十一磅，經緯紗合計，如用中國紗的話，紗本需十元以上，再加每疋開繳八·九角，就需總成本每疋十二元左右了，市價在十二元七·八角至十三元一·二角，所盈似乎極微。至用日紗作原料，那麼每疋紗本僅須八九元而已，或竟在八九元以內，加上開繳費，總成本僅僅乎十元左右，能賺兩·三元一疋，市面俏的話，說不定竟有四·五元一疋的利潤呢！普通小布廠（約有布機兩百台）每畫夜生產額三百疋（以十二磅細平而論）算，便能賺千元左右一天的純益了！一年計之，就賺上三·四十萬元，寗不驚人！</p>
<p>這三·四十萬元，僅就一家而說，特區裹各布廠合計起來，一年何止賺數百萬元，然而間接供給人家去造子彈，更不知有多少萬發！</p>
<p>比較靠得住些，還是特區裹華商紗廠咐屬有織布工塲的，所出的貨品，較爲便宜，因爲本廠有紗的生產，可以省去搖紗·打包等工資，和物料之所費（如包皮·竹　·等料），搬運又便利，自然每疋的成本極廉，能夠和外貨競爭，可惜出數有限，不能濟事，一方面敢忠吿特區裹的華商紗廠，你們售給華商小布廠的原料價值，不妨遷就多別低些，以免爲淵敺魚，爲叢敺雀，爲整個民族實業前途着想，是義不容辭的，雖則商人重利，大家也應該轉轉愛國的念明纔好！</p>
<h3>上週雙馬紗　跌落十七元半</h3>
<p>上週自十九日至二十五日一週以來之紗市、跌風驟起、蓋以春銷失望、情況衰弱、加之廠方開出甚巨、浙東局勢突吿緊張、日軍侵擾不休、人心愈形不謐、至於囤戶視環境惡劣、將吸收之紗吐出、金融界亦圖脫卸、於是變管齊下、市塲籌碼頓見鬆濫、市價乃急轉直下矣、結果二十支變馬紗價比前週跌十七元半、至廠方開出有細紗二千二百包、粗紗一千五百包、</p>
<p>紗銷華南零星交易尚堪維持、惟浙東湘贛受軍事影響而減少、且甬滬滙水突高、更難起色、故三二支回跌二十元、四二支落十元、北方津帮專鬥搜羅粗紗頗暢、但細紗絕無需要、內地帮粗紗買胃亦強也、就大體言、目前尚在軟化中、不過原棉難鬆、前途未許樂觀也、囚疇昔一般投機者、轉棧囤藏之貨太夥、一時不易斬結完竣、總之物極必返也、茲錄現紗一週統計如下、</p>

<p>麵粉　日昨廠粉與洋粉市面、大致均趨平穩之局、查廠粉自廉價以來、頗引起北洋帮之動銷、惟北帮近來對於洋粉需要亦佳、蓋販運者均有利可圖也、咋聞美澳粉產價報穩、期貨暫少成交、而行號定進之現洋粉、亦大都執住、不願輕脫、廠家現粉、業經一度推銷後、鑒於本客去路轉沾、廠盤亦不願一再貶落、故咋日二號粉廠盤站住四元五角半之原價、而本街方面則以客帮旣有特價亦擬要求特別降低、故本街批價又有四元五角之售開、統市廠粉成交共芥萬餘包、除本街及南洋帮零化外、其餘均由冀魯各帮辦去、又聞北洋帮續辦洋粉一批、額計二萬四五千包、價仍爲四元三角至二角半（現沙）云、</p>
<p>小麥　日昨來源仍感缺乏、除廠定洋麥逐有整批運到外、本麥到貨、祇用輪略有裝到、均係數十包至二三百包而巳、查銀江麥自經前日客盤售開七元之價後、咋市客方復嫌高昂、廠方吃盤更苛、而貨方仍思扳持／結果正式市面、又吿停頓、</p>

<h3>門市提高售價後　客秈店銷突增　爲了一舉兩得　杜米形勢亦緊</h3>
<p>客　秈昨日本街消化突旺、行囤客戶應酬不多、因本市店舖將門市高貨提高後、中次檔銷量定必加增、且以秈米攙於粳米之內、數亦不少、因之京蕪客秈爲店戶暢辦、即工廠零戶亦頗活潑、全日成交數加至四千石以上、行情立被提高近角至角半、南京秈昂至十三元四五角、蕪秈高貨須十三元二三角、售開者以十三元至十二元六七角居多、西貢米進出兩少、仍在十七元之左右、</p>
<p>杜　米來源、河下共祗到七號、車來包子蘇同帮一千二百餘包、小崑山帮二百八十餘包、到貨既稀、早市人心即堅、及後本街及囤戶相繼活動、形勢更緊、市呈秀色、結果厚薄粳價悉加一角、杜洋尖埠尖亦皆好起幾分至角許、變兀因聞內地對於花色貨或無封境之說、人心頗懈、且價格巳高、市面遂乏變化、仍守原盤、</p>

<h3>中央積極加強　游擊區軍攻力量　擬就調整辦法分飭實施　注意改造民生組織民衆</h3>
<p>中央爲積極準備收復失地、對游擊區之現狀、極爲關切、曾派專員分赴各區、從事考察、並加強政治訓練、調整組織機構、茲已擬就調整辦法、分飭各部隊暨縣長實施、茲錄其辦法如下、</p>
<p>調整游擊</p>
<p>各縣游擊隊、須以縣爲單位、統一組織、統一指揮、依照中央抗戰方略、凡一地淪陷之後、即展開游擊戰爭、以期達到逐漸消耗敵人「兵力」·「人力」·「財力」之目的、負領導職責者須親率官佐士兵、積極活動、埋頭苦幹、作殊死抗戰、而以後應以縣爲單位、一縣設一指揮、凡一縣所有一切游擊隊、予以嚴格訓練、則互相牽制火併等情、可以消除、抗戰力量、可以增大、而縣行政亦可以順利推進、</p>
<p>人事任用</p>
<p>處現在非常時期、乃民族到達最後關頭之時期、亦可謂復與民族最重要之階段、則一縣「軍」「民」兩政方面、應擇才學兼優、自願爲國犧牲、殺身成仁、捨身取義之決心、有苦幹硬幹實幹精神者而用之、如此對於實際、方有效果、</p>
<p>統一財政</p>
<p>目前淪陷區內、僞組織方面、捐卡林立、名目百出、民衆不堪其苦、一小車不出十里、須經二三次之勒索、一商船不出五里、須要三四次之强捐、所收之款、大都飽入私囊、而游擊隊方面之稅收、亦有紊亂之狀、縣政府固爲主辦稅收之樞紐、然有區鄉鎮公所各自單獨收捐、而縣政府不能顧問者　無縣政府區域、游擊隊固主辦捐稅、然有大隊部·中隊部各自單獨收稅、而支隊部不能顧問者、民衆負担綦重、而公家得利殊少、故嗣後各縣之財政收支、應切實施行統收統支之辦法、經調整後、盈餘之額、應存銀行、轉解財部、</p>
<p>改造民生</p>
<p>人民生活、頗感因離、改迭人民生活、實爲抗戰基本問題、蓋欲取得民衆擁護、必須安定人民生活、改造人民生活之方、消極方面、在乎减輕人民負担、如輕稅薄斂、積極方面、在乎帮助人民發展生產、如獎勵小工商業、提倡副業、如此人民經濟富足生活安適、抗戰財源、可以無窮、與敵經濟絕交、亦可同時實行、再進而組織民衆、則自可順利、民衆抗敵情緒、亦隨之增高、抗戰力量、大可發揮矣、然此諸項工作、非縣政府單獨可以做到、須得軍事當局、協同施行、</p>
<p>組織民衆</p>
<p>民衆乃游擊軍之後盾、游擊軍乃民衆之先鋒、必須軍民合作、行動一致、方能發生抗戰效力、然而淪陷區內、以前之鄉保甲組織、掃蕩無遺、民衆仍復回一盤散沙之狀態、軍是軍、民是民、兩者漠不相關、民衆有欲抗敵而無機緣、軍隊欲得民衆協助、而無從着手、其弊乃在民衆之無組織、如「宣傳」·嚮道」·「輸送」·「諜報」·「破壞」·「救濟」·等工作、概可由民衆組織完成後担任者、抑且游擊軍之武力有限、民衆之武力無窮、動員全體民衆、奮起抗敵、力量方大、效果方宏、庶幾能達到抗戰必勝、建國必成之目的、</p>
<h3>義駐華大使馬邱　乘巡洋艦赴日　四月四日可抵大阪</h3>
<p>二十九日法文上海日報載、義國巡洋艦高來而尼號、載重五千〇六十九噸、係爲義屬遠東艦隊之旗艦、聞定於今日離滬、艦上載有義國駐華大使馬邱、其所往之目的地、未便公表、惟聞日人方面、已在預備歡迎該艦中、依日方之報道、則該巡洋艦常於四月四日抵大阪、九日抵橫濱、作友誼式之訪問、故日方正在極力籌備招待中、又聞該艦在日、當逗留至四月十八日、方始他征、</p>
<h3>法公董局　頒發獎章</h3>
<p>伯爾捷得最高金章</p>
<p>公董局總裁亦膺獎</p>
<p>上海泰晤士報云、駐滬法總領事鮑黛芝、昨日（二十八日）午後、在法租界公董局內以公董局獎章五十六枚、頒贈駐滬法軍各人員、以酬受章者在戰事期內爲法租界服務之勞績、法軍司令伯爾捷大佐得</p>
<p>本埠最高</p>
<p>之公董局金章、次爲銀章、授與駐滬法軍大隊長費勃、與其他各級軍官十七員、銅章十四枚、授與法軍下級士官、鮑黛芝旋向伯大佐道賀、禮畢後鮑氏復乘機將法國外交部之</p>
<p>特殊金章</p>
<p>兩枚、授與公董局總裁白萊第安、與警務長費勃、並有法外交部之銀章授與法租界義勇團之葛羅波依與警務處特別巡捕隊之台維斯兩人、</p>
<h3>長江開放問題　前途阻礙孔多　日方有種種苛刻條件　使第三國航商難忍受</h3>
<p>字林報云、咋（二十八日）據本埠某英商航運公司人員談、靑島日海軍當局近宣佈重行開放該港、任第三國船隻出入一節、巳見諸實行、船隻今或可駛入內港、而利用內港各碼頭、該公司船隻業巳在內港碼頭卸貨而未遇阻碍、佈吿頒佈以前、外國船隻均只得在外港卸貨、且駛抵該港前數日、必須向靑島日海軍特務隊報吿</p>
<p>貨物性質</p>
<p>與總量、始准在各碼頭卸貨、又某航運業英人昨對外傳日方開放靑島後刻擬恢復揚子江一帶之第三國航運云云、不予置信、據稱、日當局與第三國代表之磋商、仍在停頓中、昨日又聞日當局堅持航行揚子江之第三國船隻、均須向日當局登記、此必使變方意見大相分歧、代表第三國之磋商人員、今圖解決此問題、蓋如果實行外國</p>
<p>航業登記</p>
<p>實將使航行揚子江中之船隻、均受日方之正式統制也、所得消息中、雖未說明如何實行登記、惟探悉其中之一項條件、爲日當局請所有外輪在江陰上游懸日旗、聞此即談判中棘手之點、揚子江開放之前、必先商妥協定、至於其他間題、較易解決、惟感覺對准許日海陸軍</p>
<p>檢查外輪</p>
<p>一節、第三國代表必稍加反對、記者咋以關於所傳消息、叩詢航運界、據稱、彼認如按照所傳日方條件而開放揚子江、則前途必多困難、鑒於地方政局之不安、許多公司自內地運貨來滬之前、必起躊躇、本埠某航運人員咋以接得漢口之書面報吿示記者、亦可證實短期內</p>
<p>不能恢復</p>
<p>揚子江航運之說、該報吿載明三月十五日發、內稱上海商行在漢口之產業、曾每週加以視察、發現日軍利用倉庫、以供貯存、而海軍部隊亦駐屯於各建築物中、日軍仍盤據其強佔之浮碼頭、不准外人前往、再日軍在江中浮碼頭一方置浮筒、阻止外國船隻沿岸停泊、且聞圖入任何外人所有之產業、實屬危險、</p>

<p>滬郊日僞加緊防範</p>
<p>又據現代社記者探悉、昨爲革命先烈紀念、又值所謂僞「維新政府成立週年」、日僞方面深恐近郊游擊隊乘機活躍、施行襲擊、故自寶山路以迄市中心區各處要口、均由僞「憲佐隊」及僞警駐防、並加派日軍多名駐守、對市民出入、濫施搜查、稍不如意、即加毆辱、浦江輪渡雖未封鎖、但搜查綦嚴、</p>

<p>據聞南京僞　綏靖部」現又調僞軍一千名來上海四郊、以代日軍後防、其一部份已到滬西與南市邊界、浦東方面、亦將有若干調去、是以游擊隊第五縱隊王金山司令、昨日調第二特務隊鈕麒麟、第三特務隊徐勝、移防至滬西北新涇·周家橋·虹橋路·斜土路·及蘇州河鐵路東西兩旁、以切斷僞軍之聯絡、故西區方面、形勢緊張、</p>

<p>我國沿海各地不幸淪陷之後、鹽稅爲日方所截留、長蘆等鹽、亦被刦奪運日、幸我國政府自二十五年起、巳督飭沿海各產區、將塲圩存鹽、移運內地、所以戰後各地、並未發生鹽荒、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>日本刦奪沿海產鹽</p>
<p>鹽分粗鹽與精鹽兩大類、前者分井鹽·石鹽·池鹽·海鹽、後者即以前者作原料、加工製造而得、海鹽保以海水截留、藉日光蒸發、或盛海水於灶而煎熬之、我國沿海各省、幾無不有海鹽出產、就其地域、則分長盧·山東·兩淮·兩浙·兩廣·福建·及東三省、等七大區、尤以兩淮·山東·長蘆·三區產鹽爲最多、以上三區、戰後因地域淪陷、產地爲日所刦奪、以長蘆鹽而言、已由南滿鐵路之日本公司統制、運日數量、已自七萬噸增至四十五萬噸、而長蘆所產之鹽、約八十五萬噸、今輸日之鹽、竟超過產額之半數、</p>
<p>淪陷區域鹽稅被截</p>
<p>淪陷區域以內、鹽稅已爲日方所截留、惟以鹽稅担保之中外借款、戰後仍由財政部墊付本息、今因環境關係、不得不採用對於關稅爲担保之各債償付辦法、同樣辦理、茲錄淪陷區二十一年產鹽數目如下、（一）長約的四百四十三萬九千担、（二）兩淮約七百五十六萬五千担、（三）山東約七百五十八萬九千担、（四）口北約二十萬零七千担、（五）河東約八十九萬一千担、（六）晉北約十九萬四千担、（七）揚州約六十萬零丸千担、（六）松江約十八萬八千担、</p>
<p>搶運存鹽增加生產</p>
<p>財政部鹽於食鹽爲國計民生所擊、平時本甚重要、在非常時期、關係益大、原有各地存鹽、尤須有充分之準備、惟平時各地行鹽、採運銷制、商人爲顧惜資金起見、每每不肯多存鹽斤、平時各銷地存鹽、大批祗敷數日銷市、故自二十五年起、即次第督飭沿海各產區積極設法、將塲圩鉅額存鹽、移運內地存儲、作爲平常食鹽、並努力增加浙東·川南·川北·福建·廣東·雲南·以及甘肅·靑海·新疆·寗夏·等處生產、</p>
<p>戰時食鹽隨時調劑</p>
<p>自七七抗戰發動之後、即斟酌各地食鹽需求、分別緩急、積極運儲推銷、並不因交通工具之缺乏而阻礙進行、例如浙東·餘姚·岱山·等處產鹽、因該處接近戰區、故由部設法搶運至後方各地、業已搶邋完竣、均由浙贛·湘桂·鐵路轉運至西南各地、今各地食鹽供需、均能隨時妥爲調劑、且後方某某等地、備藏有大批食鹽、所以各地從未發生有鹽荒之事、</p>

<h3>嚴防私販貨混銷　捲烟內運須有證明　已經日僞稅過貨物充公究辦　節省無謂消耗藉免稅款資敵</h3>

<p>兩性醫學</p>
<p>— 俄國勞働大學醫科畢業楊道南醫師著</p>
<h3>新婚後怎樣向她求愛？</h3>
<p>在結婚生活開始後，最重要的一着，就是夫婦間應把他們對於性的知織，見能，態度，互相坦白的陳述給對方知道。有時在相互交換中，可以研究出不少微妙的方法，因而增進了雙方的快樂。做丈夫的可以時時用熱情的言語，各種閨房遊戲，就能很快的促進妻的反應，或者自知有精力不足，性弱的疾病，應積極用最新方法，使之從速痊愈，這樣比較男性方面極力壓抑性的高潮方法要好得多，因爲使生殖器充血而產生一種有害的結果，由此可知男女性機能亢奮的時間不同，可以用語言，動作，醫學，等加以補救，這樣男女雙方可以感到一種絕大的快樂。我們可以簡括的總結起來講：性的關係應該充滿了相互體貼的精神，我們可以斷然的說：使你的對方感到相當的滿足，你將獲得更大的愉快！</p>
<p>夫婦間的愛情不佳，往往因丈夫喪失性力所致，但一經嘗試興趣之後，她也能與丈夫和裹共濟，同床合夢了。</p>
<p>漠視性衛生的男子，每易罹患早洩陰痿，及喪失生殖機能等毛病，這是無可諱言的，然關於此種毛病在臨床上的治療，具有正確的功效者，首推德國梅倫博士所發明的眞正動物睪丸內分泌劑男用「補體康」，服後廿四小時後新的血液即源源產生，從此四肢百骸即恢復繁榮；保證性力健全，上述各症，永不發生，而夫婦間的愛情遂與日俱增矣。「女用補體康」專治婦女各症</p>
<h3>鞏固精關最有效的藥劑</h3>
<p>— 德國醫學博士鄭霆</p>
<p>遺精症爲喪失精血最烈的疾患，而遺精的原因，大都起於自凟，自凟成習後，射精中樞爲之斵傷，精關鬆弛，而有遺精之現象，患有遺精的靑年，因其精血不斷地流洩，而其身體亦因而衰弱，此時若不好好治療，往往變爲無夢而遺及見色流精等嚴重之病象，或有發現神經衰弱，腦弱健忘，腰痠背痛等症。一個健全的靑年，爲欲自凟遂情，以致喪失所有的幸福，誠爲可惜。但要挽救此種頃向，驅除遺精之爲害，不得不先從鞏固精關着手，而「耐而斯遺精片」一藥，對治療上述的病症，實有其莫大之功效，故不論夢遺，滑精及見色流精等，大有其着手回春之妙，遺精既止之後，若身體虧損，神經衰弱，腰痠背痛等症，宜以德國睾丸精質製劑男用「補體康」補之，則不論任何嚴重之衰弱症象，即能應手而愈。</p>

<h3>淋病之解放</h3>
<p>— 美國醫學博士黃仲昌醫師撰述</p>
<p>二十世紀中之醫學進步史上，以淋病療法爲最，當初風行一時之療法，以透膜殺菌法爲最，但因淋菌不是完全在粘膜上者，凡是血液關節等處，莫不有淋菌之踪跡。所以此種透膜殺菌療法，即宣吿徹底失敗。而德國醫學博士彼德氏，作進一步之研究，用特種蛋白體黃色素混合製成「克淋儂」一藥，服後能在短期內，發生抗淋噬菌，消炎鎮痛之作用，此種作用，能直接發生於病灶，可稱爲淋痛患者得到惟一解放之療法。</p>
<p>淋病息者一旦被淋菌所傳染，猶如毒蝎在身，痛苦非凡，往往有厭世自殺之謬想。而其最感痛苦之淋病，無過於淋毒性後尿道炎之症狀。因爲淋毒一朝入于後尿道後，即感到甚大之麻煩。以其淋菌所侵入之路線增多，而變症自亦蜂起，假如用一般透膜殺菌，及化學療法，其殺菌作用，未必能擋得起如水銀瀉地，無孔不入之淋菌，過去淋病之不能短期根治者，其故即在於此。</p>
<p>現在因有「克淋儂」之發明，故淋病之療法，大異　昔，久爲歐美各國醫家所贊佩，據白賽仲博士在其紐約所設花柳病院之實驗，謂余在該院，前後經過治療淋病者，于二十年內，何止千寓人，而在「克淋儂」未發明以前，要求淋病根治，殊感棘手。惟自「克淋儂」一藥發明之後，根治各期淋病，巳不若從前之困難矣。尤其淋病已侵入後尿道者，如服用「克淋儂」絕對可以根治，藥性王道，成績優良。</p>
<p>在外用藥方面，則「抗淋水」一藥，對於男子洗滌尿道，掃除淋菌，女子淋毒白帶，可外用「卡而雪地陰道片」爲坐藥，以排除淋毒白帶，則對與男女一切淋病，更爲有效。並極合家庭自療之原則。</p>
<h3>傷風成癆</h3>
<p>— 盛在強醫師</p>
<p>患者金振泉，年三十三歲，前冬故鄉淪陷，因而隨衆逃難，其時大雪飛紛，風又甚緊，感受風寒，咳嗽不巳，因自恃體格強健，又因心亂如麻，故而未經醫治，但自去春起，胸部忽感刺痛，濃痰甚多，乃服藥醫治，絕無效驗，至去秋病勢愈感惡化，體熱盜汗，始來余處治療，余即令其靜養，並內服「補肺拿爾」。金君尊余言而行，米及一月，體熱已退，濃痰漸少，連服二月有餘，諸症全消，壯健如初，現服務於某公司。「補肺拿爾」所以能收此奇效者，實因其成分純潔，而應用科學方法精密提煉而製成，故絕非偶然之事也。</p>

<h3>直接有害生殖的淋病</h3>
<p>淋病與生殖機能之易受陣礙，實爲每個淋病患者不可免之事。此等淋病，由於淋毒煎迫生殖機能，使其組織，失去健全機能，而成爲不孕之悲哀者；舉例言之，精囊爲內生殖器之一，占生殖上最重的部分，凡淋毒性精囊炎的患者，其預後十九與生殖上有絕大的關係，而且自淋毒性精囊炎，繼着又有輸精管炎，睾丸炎等，或者此等症狀，同時迸發，亦未可知，須知雖患此等症狀中之一，即有受斬絕子嗣的危險，所以淋病患者最好使其避免此等續發症，即不幸續發此等症象，亦宜及早根治，庶幾可免他日之後悔，是余二十年來在臨床上由誠實統計之結果，望會患淋病而未愈者，必宜留心</p>
<p>對於根治因淋毒而使生殖上發生障礙之療法，以近來醫學之進步，此種症狀如未陷入十分難于挽救之境地，則對生育上發生難題的淋病，大多可以解決，恢復共健全的生殖機能，並非難事。由余經驗，淋病聖藥「克淋儂」一藥，是肅淸淋毒的最有效的內服藥，因其具有抗淋噬菌之作用，凡淋菌在生殖器上之淋菌，能徹底掃除之，一方又用德國靜電療法，及X線電療法交互爲用，即交相發揮殺菌功效，因之將此威脅生殖機能之淋病，即可完全根治而愈。于以足見科學進步之速也　診時：上午十時至下午六時。自即日起每天送診二十　。每號僅取號金五角。</p>

<p>衣食住行]</p>
<h3>喫與文化</h3>
<p>— 納爵</p>
<p>我們的民族，可以說是「好喫的民族」。朋友來往見面時笫一句應酬語常說：「你喫過飯沒有」？好比西人相見時說聲「早安」，或是「你好」。家人朋友間通訊，又慣常地希望對方「努力加餐」。古書上爻說過：「民以食爲天」，更足以代表了好喫民族的全部政治思想。</p>
<p>那麽我們民族好喫的原因何在呢？誰都知道我們是幾千年的農業國，農村裏的生產品，什九是食料，農人的實際生活狀況，委實是太貧乏了，農人唯一的享受，就是喫喝；別的幸福，因著他們無錢去享受，這樣的生活經過了幾千年，當然成了習慣，使喫的藝術，在我國特殊發展，而其他一切都比人家落伍了。歐美文化雖然有驚人的進展，但是講起喫的藝術，卻保留著原始人類用刀叉的道風，和我們拿筷子的民族比較，他們的本領是落後的多了。</p>
<p>好喫已是我們民族唯一的活動目標；所以婚姻吉慶須「潔樽候光」，就是喪家開吊，也得大喫特喫，好喫是我們生活的全部。</p>
<p>不差，喫是人類生活的基本要求；但是文明人類的生活，並不是喫可以包刮一切的；除了喫，還該有衣，住，行，娛樂，教育，的要求和享受。</p>
<p>所以一個民族文化水準的高低，據說可以把人民平均生話費中喫的費用所佔的百分比來加以測驗。文化愈發展，那麽食料的消費，在生活費總額中所佔百分率愈低；歐美工人家庭的食項開支，只佔全部生活費百分之三十。但印度民族的食項開支，（包刮粉食蔬菜等）競佔坐活費百分之九十四，此外只有百分之六，供衣服又，醫藥，和一切雜費。我國沒有精確的統計，但是大多數農民的生活狀態，事實上不會比印度人富裕；便是都市裏的人們生活費，總有百分之五十以上消耗在喫的開支上頭吧。</p>
<h3>黑索里尼的住</h3>
<p>— （蟾）</p>
<p>黑索里尼，在近幾年來的國際舞臺上真可以說是一個不可一世的風雲兒了。可是說來實在有點使人不相信；他雖是義大利的首相，毎星期的薪水卻只有六金鎊，這是出於他自已希望的。當然，誰多會想，這僅僅六金鎊怎樣夠他和他的妻子還有五個孩子一星期的開銷呢？然而他的日常生活依舊很安適，衣食住行四項中，單就「住」的一項而言，他的私邸就很富麗堂皇，也許有人不明白，但說出來卻普通得很，原來他做首相的費用都是政府代出的，並且因爲他的薪水是那麼小所以從沒有人向他借過錢。</p>
<p>幾年前，有一個崇拜他的人送給他一間富麗堂皇的家宅，另外又有一個傢俱商免費給他把屋子裝飾起來。義大利的美術館，特地把裝飾牆壁用的圖畫送給他。汽車製造商也一定要他接受最新式汽車的禮物，而商人們呢？贈給他許多日常用品。都不願受一文錢。總之，他家裏的沙發，椅子，大餐台，書桌，甚至於刀叉鉛筆之類，沒有一物是化錢買來的。</p>
<h3>他們的衣食住行</h3>
<p>— 吳澐</p>
<h3>漢板車</h3>
<p>— 李韶年</p>
<p>漢板車是一種行的工具，在綏遠最易看見。其樣式與普通騾車彷彿，唯不及騾車之大，其機構與騾車亦不相同，普通騾車大都是兩輪轉動，漢板車則是連車軸亦隨同車輪轉動。此蓋因其全車皆爲木製，車軸與車輪釘於一處之故。</p>
<p>漢板車皆用牛拉，因牛行走較慢，車子可平穩前進；若用驢騾來拖，則定要出叉子。因其車身與車軸之間，只用兩根木頭將車軸夾在中間，車上大都是以運糧爲多，坐人因有危險，故不曾有；車子若行的快了，不免便要「出軸。」（說是車軸同車輪與車身脫離）但土人爲了經濟的限制，亦只得使用這種車子也，這也是實在因爲它的製法太簡單而價錢也太便宜了。</p>
<p>漢板車的車輪，亦無輻載之分，而只是數塊木板拼成一個園形的輪子而已。其車身亦無車篷，而只有幾根木頭在兩旁及後面做成小欄杆的樣子；有的上面也釘些木板。</p>
<p>雖然如此，但是它在綏遠，卻佔有很高的地位，因爲那邊的人民生活清苦，好的車子實在無力購製，故在今日，漢板車在民間還是主要的交通工具。</p>
<h3>經濟公寓</h3>
<p>— 周子</p>
<p>上海家用的住屋，除了一般的所調洋房之外，普通的所謂堂堂房子，千篇一律的，總是前面個天井，中間一個客堂，後面一個灶間，附著一個不成其局的小天井。雖然這種屋子，普通都是向南的，然而一來因弄堂狹窄，二因實際上，向南的，僅只一個客堂的前部，樓上也僅只客堂樓的前半部，可得陽無。所以在實際上，可得陽光，而室氣流通的，是僅只一幢屋子的三分之一。其他的三分之二，可說得是冬涼夏暖，終年的悶寒著的。住居其中，不衛生的程度，是不難想像而得之。</p>
<p>本來這種所謂弄堂房子的建築，一上一下的，是僅適於一個小家庭之居住的。客堂樓，闢臥室。亭子樓，充書房，及供親戚的小住。前客堂，供吃飯，休息，客堂背後供女傭臥息。自然是夠。但是試問在上海，經濟能力，足夠一家住居一上一下者，能有幾家。雖然在此種房屋式樣初流行時，或亦是適於社會之所需要的，然而數十年來，社會經濟，以數經劇變，而一般的弄堂房屋式樣，還是一成不變。於是一屋之中，二房東，三房客，擠得猶如一個大暖鍋。終日的人聲鼎沸。即使丟開銜生問題而不論，最低限度，這種落伍的弄堂房子之不適於現在的社會，總也是一個無可諱言的事實。</p>
<p>在上海住家，最是適宜的，我覺得是無過於公寓。各室旣互相隔離，而各室又各有其用處。既合於衛生，又切於實用。但是在今日的上海，公寓雖然衆多，然大半均僅租給西人居住。即有租給華人者，則又貴族化的，使薪給生活者，望而卻步。因現有的一切所謂公寓，可說是與西人所寓者，完全一樣的場面，絕對沒有一些兒平民化的氣味的——因此，我是有了一個設計構築合於華人社會，而替代現有的弄堂房子的，合於中等小家庭居住的經濟公寓的意念。</p>
<p>我的經濟公寓的計劃，是以「室」爲單位的'每一窒以寬十五呎，深二十呎爲標準。一大室中，更套一「小室」。小室，以深寬各八呎爲度。大室爲臥室，小室爲起坐及進膳之用。這麽的一大室，一小室，可容一個小家庭。合四塋，或五室為一小組，可設一公共廚房，一公共則所，一公共僕役臥室。（若干家僕役合臥一室。）及一公共洗衣室。再合若干小組爲一大組，相等於今日之一個弄堂。</p>
<p>這種房屋的構造，在衛生方面，因臥室一律向南，陽元充足，更加沿弄堂，若在闊十呎至十五呎的弄堂中，栽植些花木，空氣可益形清新。廁所，灶間，與臥室，有一走廊之隔，對於銜生問題，自然更有裨益。</p>
<p>每一個小家庭，租住一室，在普通之家，已可不感無迴旋之餘地之苦。因廁所，灶間，洗衣室等，已各有公用之專室。在事實上，已可毫無困難與不便。而合若干小組而為一大組，或為一里弄時，更可有禮堂，會客室等之設備，較之現有之弄堂房屋，似覺更爲週備。</p>
<p>至於在房價方面，或較現在之弄堂房屋，稍爲高昂。然而以一上一下原有之地位，依此設計而論，已可容納二個小家庭居住。則較諸原來之獨住一幢者，已可節省不少，經濟之支出。而同時，租住者，更可免卻二房東與三客弈之間之不少糾葛，因此類經濟公寓式之租賃，既以「室」為單位，在事實上，實已無「二房東」「三房客」等名詢的存在了。</p>
<h3>一星期經濟菜單</h3>
<p>— 華英女士</p>
<p>上星期介紹了一様糟味的美肴糟扣肉，因此又想到其他糟味的菜肴來，同様是很可口而可以增加飯量的。譬如糟白雞糟白鴨糟白肉，每逢夏季，如陸稿薦浦五房等，就應市出售，紫陽觀中也有糟鱷魚糟乳腐等，這些糟品，都清而不膩，夏季用來佐酒佐粥，是很適宜的。至於家常菜肴，如糟青魚糟腸湯也不妨來介紹一下。在冬季過年的時光，買一尾青魚來，切成片段，用香糟糟透，酌加由鹽，放在小·內蓋緊，到了春初取出來紅燒，加些香菇筍片木耳等輔佐品，吃起來津津有味。至於糟腸湯一味，可買豬大腸一副，內外必須加工洗淨，然後加了糟滷和竹筍，肉片等一同白燉，湯可放得大些，用以泡飯，也是很爽口的。</p>

<h3>吳稚暉談女子衣服</h3>
<p>— （伯琦移酬助賑）</p>
<p>前歲文園春宴，時賢畢集，餘欣陪末座，得識攝影前輩郎靜山，老書畫家馬公愚，中委吳稚暉諸名人。席間談及女子衣服問題；稚暉老先生大發議論：謂西洋舊時女裝，形如「Ｋ」字；中國古代女裝，形如「A」字；至於中國摩登之短袖貼身蟬翼旗袍，身體凹凸部份畢顯，望之直如「容」字。彼意賞此努力建設時期，男女應共同從事生產事業，故女子衣服，亦應與男子一樣，用簡樸便利之中山裝，方合於時代需要也。</p>
<h3>人造棉羢之原料</h3>
<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>予自西子回籍，養屙湖上，因受浙省政府建設應聘任為改良紙料設計專員，遂以吾浙所有各種樹皮草莖，試行堿漂工程，發見一種麻料，其光澤竟與人造絲一般。予因主張人造絲之原料，可以不用外國木漿，大可用此，並可以製人造棉及人造羊毛羢，無須化成液體，可以直用造紙廠之蒸解及扣解機以造織維。但於中間一段乾燥工程，則不適用造紙機器，須照製鎂廠之烘房設備，使能鬆而不結，即可用紡紗廠之彈花機及梳花機以造成棉，然後紡成紗線，或成絲線，或成羢線，均可任意。因其製法，可以分為兩種，用鈉製者，性質強硬，光澤耀目，與普通人造絲同；用鉀製者，性質柔軟，並能取暖，且在吾浙方面，富產桐堿，可與石灰配合，製出「苛性鉀」與「碳酸鈣，」核其成本，實比購用「苛性納」為廉。至於漂白劑，則以漂粉輿桐堿配合，製出「次亞鹽酸鉀，」其副產亦為碳酸鈣，可供牙粉牙膏及橡膠製品之用。惟設備費頗巨，故雖對此計劃，而竟未能實行。及至丁醜三月，新任建設廳長王文伯先生，因見美國人李某站所製之人造棉，與予所製者品質相同，愛與李某相偕過訪，謀輿合作，已有成議，機器由彼裝運來杭，原料則由我方供給。蓋以官荒放種，每畝能產四擔之麻，一人能種五畝，即就筧橋一帶而論，售興臨平長安之價，每以司碼種九十八斤爲一擔，計分黃麻錄麻兩種，黃麻質細而靱，普通用爲麻絲，每年十月播種，七月初上市，新貨每擔八元，隔年陳貨每擔十二元，綠麻質粗而脆，普通爲製麻袋之用，五月播種，七八月即可收割，新貸每擔僅四五元，陳貨每擔七八元，故以專種黃麻爲宜。沿江一帶沙田，先經種草養淡，即可種麻，每畝用肥，衹需豆餅二擔，實可爲我浙省開一利源。預計不過三年以至五年，不但可以自供自給，且可銷出外洋，而種麻不比種桑，但用其子，不必用秧，專種之易，收獲之速，固不可以同日語也。惜自八一三戰事起後，這成畫餅，殊為可惜，予抵蒸湖時，曾與火中紗廠唐家珍兄談及人造棉事，因其廠中之回絲車可以彈棉成卷，頗易著手。唐君木爲滬上名醫，因其志在藥棉，愛先著手於脫脂棉之堿漂工程，已爲規定方式，而趙志游兄與殷子白兄，適已同來籌畫遷廠，予遂先赴漢·，與上海銀行行長，謀求湖北所產之麻，用為原料，但其性質，逈與浙產不同，含有膠質甚多，耗費堿漂劑甚巨，而麻價亦倍於浙，頗爲失望。及抵重慶，由寶元通之黃涼塵君介紹，與吳鴻哲君晤面，則此人造棉之計劃，渠亦抱『有志向未竟成之憾，曾以所製原料，托由廣東省立紗廠，試妨出樣，但仍未能集資進行，因知人材兩缺之嘆，實不適用於我中國，蓋所缺老財耳。川滇於之產棉不多，吾意不久之將來，自必有人念及於此，以政府之力量爲之，則於財用方面，自可不成間題。至其製造方法，則頗簡單，蓋以任何樹皮草莖之造紙料無異，可令鄕人以手工漚麻？先生膠質，後經搗練，即可減輕運費至三分之二以上，至其種地土壤，凡能生育草之地，無不可種，比之種棉容易多矣。吾浙產棉校多，尚不必需乎此，但在西南方面，人口增多，無衣之難，或將不免，則此綢繆未雨之計，豈必人而不如島乎？</p>

<h3>吳稚暉講　門外漢意中之敎育問題　（三）　嚴格管理方不致失敗　國難當頭節約要以身作則</h3>

<h3>李惠堂一封信　十年滄桑記</h3>
<p>（香港通訊）球王李惠堂近致函其友桑楡、其中說盡其十年來之滄桑、文情並茂、顔多警惕之訶、可作球員借鏡、茲錄之如下、</p>
<p>中英國際慈善盃賽後、承你加意獎飾、使這人老珠黃、早應在淘汰之列的我、感奮　報、交織心頭、</p>
<p>斷足後、因義賽勉爲其難、毎次出場、都戰戰兢兢踏草地如履薄冰、心中常怕遭人們擯棄、有時想起了、先父生前諄諄告誡、「美人自古如名將、不使人間見白頭」、那兩句話使我愈加警惕疎懼、然而賴先君在天之靈、每番賽後、都得著好友們的佳評、這無上的慰藉、不知打斷了我多少次要「洗雖鉛華」的決心、很多友人覺得驚奇、卅五歲的人、在足球圈裏胡混了廿個年頭、即使不受人遺棄、自家本身、也該厭倦了、其實到了這時、還不厭倦、大概是我嗜愛過深、天賦我一種特癖、而卅五的年華、仍覺氣力充沛、仍不取惡於人、也許是年來社會的巨眼、把我嚴厲地監視著、使我最低限度、在東半球一帶不敢作奸犯科、使我深自實惜自己的地位名譽、行爲上力加檢點、修身自治、如此而已，那來旁的秘訣、老實說、今日仍不自量力地在球場中奔逐、連我本人也有點莫明其妙、因爲爲的足球生命、十年來已有三次的死而復活了、第一回、在民十九年、樂華組隊征歐、以人材短缺、中途折返、限看國內體育團體之不能推誠合作、憤恨中竟立下從茲洗手不幹的念頭、後來想想歐行之大願一日不償、雄心一日不得安息、自滬邊眷南歸、復爲母會南華效力、民廿二秋、在八打威因運動過烈、競犯肺膜炎危疾入院、調治月餘、山居休養百日，那醫士愛深、再三叮嚀、愈後不宜冉作錦標運動、否則必殆、可是民廿三、歸港後、又因第十屆遠東大會而勉力爲國出席、翌年那位年靑而有燦爛前途的良醫、競不幸先我而逝、眞使人扼腕萬分、到民廿六夏、隨南華、師次三寶壟、爲一半·者踢斷左筋、那時自忖這番一定完了、臥院中曾寫有「從茲球命便蓋棺、是非功過誰論定」的句、可見當時確有高掛球靴的決心、到去年九月、國難中籌賑義賽、經友好們的幾番勸勉、重為馮婦、直到於今、也不過想稍盡國民天職、在後方做點小小工作而已、這上述的三回事、在我毎次的追憶中、都有無窮的迥味、</p>
<p>放大點眼光、從我國體育團立塲來說、這種怪現象、是不足恭維欣喜的、「長江後浪推前浪」、我們這一類的過去人物、根本早該退避賢路、可是「後浪不前推、英才何處等」、我們體育的遠落人後、良非無因、在今日我們·力一心、大家推進的過度時期、未始非一件大大的憾事、</p>

<p>譬如有強盜要想打進你的家裹來，你各處門户牢閉，墻擊堅固，強盜無如之何，這當然是強盜的失敗。強盜的失敗，當然是你的勝利。因此，滬戰三個月，敵人始終局促於一隅，不能深人，我們就可以作如是觀，認爲我們防禦戰的勝利。</p>
<p>強盜終於打進你的家裹來了，當然是他勝利而你失敗了。然而他這時的勝利，終不能掩去他昔日的失敗，而你今日的失敗，也終不能消去你昔日的勝利。因此，國軍的撤離上海，簡直可以視作功成而退。</p>
<p>不過這還是一時一地，小焉者也的看法。假使強盜所進的，只是你的前宅或側廂，你還把守着你的後堂和內室，你和他還在搏鬥中，那你就根本算不得失敗，而他也算不得勝利。適得其反，竟可以說是你勝利而他失敗的，因爲你的防禦力並沒有失墜，而他的進攻到底還沒有奏效。因此，上海淪陷後，二十個月中，南京，武漢，以及廣州等地，相繼淪陷，一直到現在爲止，只要我們還在打，我們還是處在勝利中，而敵人處在失敗中。至於將來我們終能將境內敵人逐出去，猶如你終能將室內強盜逐出去，那不必說，更是我們的全勝，敵人的大敗，在這以前的一些小出入，更其算不得什麽了。</p>
<p>總之，防禦戰只要能夠防禦得牢，就是勝利；攻擊戰，假使攻擊不進去，不能消減敵人，即使全師而退，也就是失敗。現在，我們的防禦力，只有愈戰愈勁，而敵人的攻擊力，只有漸戰漸弱，我們雖然還不免於軍隊撒退，土地淪陷，我們確實是在勝利中，敵人確實是在失敗中。</p>
<p>我不是强詞奪理，更不是在這南昌巷戰聲中，自爲解嘲，我自認有所見而云然。有理智而又有自信力的人總能首肯我這樣的觀念吧。</p>
<p>假使我們果然失敗了，我們還當奮發起來，抗戰到底；現在我們雖小有挫折，却明明並沒有失敗，還是勝利的，那我們就應當怎樣的高興鼓舞，來達到我們的最後目的，逐出我們的敵人呢？</p>
<h3>老奶奶進城（下）</h3>
<p>— 明枝</p>
<p>『看來這樣子不見得會吃虧吧，』她笑着說。</p>
<p>這時王明源一夥人，不能不承認老奶奶有本事了。而老奶奶的兒子和媳婦，也覺得這樣一來，危險性似乎改輕了許多，心裏定些，便不再阻止她。</p>
<p>然而富一些傢伙和傳單取出來時，却又發生困難了。因爲東西是那樣的多，傢伙有十二枝，傳單有一大捆，老奶奶一個人決乎不能一概携帶牠們進去。假使只盡量帶一些進去，又怕裹面不夠用，誤了大事。王明源又爲此躊躇了起來。</p>
<p>『有辦法，』老奶奶想了一想說，『不是四個城鬥還有三個開着麽？我就進出這三個城門，走上三次就是了。』</p>
<p>由於她的安排，決定了這樣的辦法：她的兒子挑一担柴，柴裹放好那些東西，遙遙地送她到離東城三里的一個大墳圍裹，給她帶進去三分之一，然後再在南城外和西城外的三里之處，給她分批帶進去。一天之內，照她的估計，總也辦得了了。</p>
<p>她的兒子，本來還不大放心，現在要他做這件事，倒也樂於答應了。因爲他想，至少他可以早些得知他母親的消息，不必呆在家裹乾着急了。</p>
<p>『老奶奶，祝你成功！』</p>
<p>老奶奶和她的兒子，先後在王明源這一夥人的祝頌聲中，離開了家。</p>
<p>他們走着走着，到了那個大墳園裹，一看沒有人來往，就停了下來。老奶奶將四枝盒子砲，用破爛的布片，分綁在她的大腿和小腿上，又將一束傳單，分紮在她的兩臂上，然後取起竹棒和破籃，和她的兒子約好了南門外相見的地方，就此分道而行。</p>
<p>她實行其事的求乞着，尤其過了弔橋，將近進城時，雖然明知將多遭人家的叱罵，她更是一家一家，挨次求乞過去。偶然有人家給以一個銅圓，或一些殘　冷炙，她也坦然受下，更歡然道謝地吃下。城門口的守衛者，不是沒有眼睛的，早就看見她了。</p>
<p>她求乞到了城門口，一看見守衛的黃衣人，便向他雙手合十拜着，嘴裹則喃喃地說：</p>
<p>『謝謝好老爺，讓我進去弄些吃吃罷，實在要餓死了。』</p>
<p>『去去去去！』黃衣人怒叱着。</p>
<p>她看黃衣人並不一定不許她進去，意思之間只要她離開他遠些，所以她就一面拜着，一面喃喃着，背朝了城裏，就此退步挨了進來。</p>
<p>她一進城，在黃衣人眼光所及之處，還是一家一家求乞着。等到轉了灣，她就不再求乞，直向王明源和她所說的地方來。</p>
<p>她見到了那另一夥人，將她帶來的東西交給了他們，並且說了應說的話，就向出城的街上走着。她仍是出東門，不過這時不再求乞，只見慢慢地走着。走過黃衣人面前時，她又拜他，又喃喃地說：</p>
<p>『謝謝好老爺，讓我進去吃了一飽。』</p>
<p>黃衣人睬也不睬她。</p>
<p>她一過弔橋，轉了灣，便急急往南走去。</p>
<p>她一天之間，就這樣進出了三次城門。她的使命完成了，在傍晚的時光，她和她的兒子一同回到了自己的家裹。</p>
<p>『老奶奶辛苦了！』王明源一看見她，就這樣迎上來說。</p>
<p>『老奶奶眞好胆量！』一夥人也都這樣稱讚。</p>
<p>『這比了你們的打仗，算得什麼』。老奶奶客氣地說。</p>
<p>明天夜裹，這裹的一夥人，和別處的各夥人，很輕易地攻入了城中。因爲城裹的黃衣人本來只有一二百個，而城裹又有另一夥人在接應，一時之間，黃衣人不知虛實，有性命的就都衝出北門，逃到三十里外一個大鎮上去，和其餘的黃衣人會合。</p>
<p>早上，城裹貼滿了抗戰的傳單，「靑天白日滿地紅」，在燦爛的陽光中飛揚着。</p>
<p>傍晚，各夥的人帶着戰利品又退回了各自的根據地。</p>
<p>『老奶奶，』王明源一看見老奶奶就說，『這一次的功勞是你的。』</p>
<p>『那有的話。』</p>
<p>『可是今夜我們就要遷到別的地方去了，過了幾時我們再來打擾你吧。』</p>
<p>這一夥人去了，老奶奶進城的故事，傳遍了各地。</p>
<h3>自作孽</h3>
<p>— 何漢</p>
<h3>新現實主義的應作方法</h3>
<p>— 楊晉豪</p>
<p>抗戰文藝的寫作活動，原是多方面的，—不管是浪漫主義或寫實主義，只要把主題集中到抗戰建國上來，我們部需要。不過，我們却仍要繼續着兩三年來所要求的，希望作家們加緊執行新現實主義的寫作方法，因爲它是最能揭露現實本質和顯示現實發展的寫作路綫。</p>
<p>關於新現寶主義的寫作方法，A·法捷耶夫在其「創作方法論」的演說辭中，所引用的他在「打倒席勒」這論文中的一段話，說明得已很驚闢。那雖是對於蘇聯普羅作家而說的話，但對於被壓迫被侵略下的我國抗戰文藝作家，也同樣適用。他說：</p>
<p>「第一，　　的前衛的藝術家，不走浪漫主義的路，就是，不走現實的神秘化的路，作爲『時代精神的留聲機』的英雄人格的考案的路，『使我們昂揚起來的虛偽』的路，而是最澈底的，決定的，無容情的，從現實上「剝去所有的假面」的路。</p>
<p>「第二，　　的前衛的藝術家，不走粗樸的寫實主義的路，他要『自來的先入觀念』，從『事物的最表面的可視性」，給出最淸明的生活的各種光景，就是，要能夠做到在最大限度地傳達出的程度上，從『偶然性的斑點』之下，證明現實的辯正法。</p>
<p>「第三，和過去的偉大的寫實主義者們不同，　　藝術家要看見社會的發展過程，及推動這過程和決定這發展的各種根本的力；就是，他要表現在舊的東西中新的誕生，在今日之中的明日的誕生，以及新的對於舊的鬭爭和勝利。這又是說，　　藝術家是比過去的任何藝術家，都更其不只說明世界，而且有意識地服務世界的變革的工作的。」</p>
<p>自然，我們現在並不提倡　　文學，反之中國的　　階級非執行民族解放的鬭爭便不能求得解放，而使　　文學必須聯合到抗戰文藝的洪流中去。抗戰文藝是被壓迫被侵略的民族進求解放的關爭的文藝，是探取着眞理的最有進步性的文藝；無疑地，它需要「從現實上『剝去所有的假面』，「從『偶然性的斑點』之下，證明現實的辯證法」，「而且有意識地服務世界的變革的工作的。」</p>
<p>不過，認識了這個理論的原則還不夠，更得將它實踐而具體化起來才好。因而，</p>
<p>第一，作家們應得深入到抗戰建國的現實生活中去，參加這一個鬭爭，調查這一個鬭爭，體驗這一個鬭爭，瞻望這一個鬭爭，從那非常豐富的現象世界之中，撇去那非本質的，庸俗的，表面的，立即會消滅掉的偶然性的東西，而抽象出那本質的，典型的，普遍的，爲客觀的必然性的東西來。</p>
<p>第二，作家們必得透澈地瞭解抗戰建國的理論，靈活地運用動的邏輯來認識這一次抗戰的性質，過程和前途，它在發展中的國內和國際方面所必然到來的動態，以及怎樣地去處理它們而爭取到抗戰建國的最後勝利。</p>
<p>第三，作家們須得經常地投進大衆的行列，在抗戰建國之共同的實踐中，去和大衆一同憤慨，一同奮發，一同哀樂，一同進取，把一己的個性在大衆的鎔爐中鍛冶成爲大衆的共性，而後將那普遍一致的感覺，從筆端下尖銳地渲染出來！</p>
<p>截止今日，那預示着將來的，指點着生活，教育和鼓動着鬭爭的文藝產品，是極需要，但是不夠。這裹，我們除掉希望已成的作家加緊執行新現實主義的寫作方法外，更希望那富有生活經驗的新作家起來擴大而且推進抗戰文藝的寫作活動！</p>
<p>中篇小說</p>
<h3>烽火中</h3>
<p>— 周燕</p>
<p>說完了，又雙腳立正，對着陳鎮長的屍體行了個最敬禮。大家也都跟着行禮，都低下了頭，表示靜默的哀悼。</p>
<p>葉團長呌過幾個雜役兵來，命他們把　軍官以及宣撫班長和獨眼李的屍體，拖到野外叢塚間去掘坑埋葬。至於陳鎮長的屍體，則把頭顱包好後，抬回他的私宅去，準備第二天和他的女兒秀月同時舉行公葬。</p>
<p>合浦鎮克復了，那些失陷時隨軍撤退或者逃在別的安全地帶的民衆都紛紛重返故里，個個都悲喜交集。他們或大或小的都遭了些損失，有的房屋被炸或燒掉了，有的房屋雖然倖存，屋裹的長物却已無一存留，然而能得全家安然無恙，已經要算是不幸中的大幸了。至於那些不幸在這次刦難中死去了親人的，在這重新獲得自由的日子，想到不久以前還和自己在一起言笑爲歡的人，如今已隔了一個世界，永遠不得再見，不禁都同時放出了悲聲。其中尤以醫生金楚南傷心得厲害，他一想到他那日常跬步不離的美貌夫人，已經喪生在　軍手裹，便痛恨　軍刺骨；因爲痛恨　軍的緣故，他特地跑到葉團長面前來，要求葉團長把那些俘虜一律槍斃，至少也要讓他手刃十來個出氣，並且代他的夫人報仇。</p>
<p>葉團長却沒有答應他的要求，他很誠懇的對金楚南解釋優待俘虜的重要性說：</p>
<p>『我們一定要優待俘虜，因爲這不但是戰時軍人應有的道德，而且我們可以從俘虜身上審訊敵情，做瓦解敵軍的工作。我們要知道，值得痛恨的是敵國的軍閥，而不是敵軍個人，倘若我們隨意把俘虜殺害，我們自己便陷於不仁，違背我們這次抗戰是義戰的本意了。』</p>
<p>金楚南怏怏的走了，看他的樣子，好像很覺不滿。葉團長也不去理他，他寫了封家信，呌一個船戶到太湖裹去尋訪葉老先生和葉太太，信裹除了報吿合浦鎮已經克復的消息外，並且吿訴他們家中的房屋業已燒成了白地，呌他們如若那邊可以安身，暫時不必回來。</p>
<p>第二天，在合浦鎮上是個很重要的日子。這天不僅爲陳鎮長和秀月舉行公葬，而且因爲恰好是星期一，所以同時舉行紀念週，召集全體民衆和軍隊訓話。一淸早，便有許多民衆到廣塲上來集合。葉團長早巳戎裝佩劍的立在塲中，他的容色非常嚴肅。不多一會，在軍樂隊的大吹大擂聲中，幾個夫役抬了陳鎮長和秀月的靈柩，直到塲中停下，靈柩上都覆着國旗。葉團長領導全體民衆和兵士，向靈柩行了最敬禮，的略報吿了者番陳鎮長和秀月死難的經過，最後又說：（四六）</p>

<h3>米高梅駐滬代表談　上海電影觀衆的傾向</h3>
<p>— 呆子</p>
<p>—最重視者爲明星的動作</p>
<p>米　高梅駐滬辦事處發言人最近曾向大陸報記者發表談話，述及上海電影觀衆對於該公司影片及明星的傾向。因爲所指不無相當的見地，筆者特把發言人所述種種，譯在下面，以吿「游藝界」讀者：</p>
<p>「一般中國的電影觀衆，對於美國的明星，最重視的一點，便是動作。也許唯一的原因，便是動作在影片之中，最容易理會，就是不懂英語對白的人，看了演員的動作，也可了解全片的情節。」發言人是這樣的說。</p>
<p>「鑒如像音樂滑稽片，中國的電影觀衆非常歡迎，」發言人接着說，「這種影片，通常故事的結構，是很簡單的，除了很插人音樂之外，佈景是相當的奇特和壯麗。」</p>
<p>「然而你決不會知道這種影片在公映的時候，」他說，「有時觀衆的擁擠，竟會使你驚奇。舉個例子，「絕代豔后」（Marie　Autoinette）就有道種傾向。這部出品，全片並不有較多的動人的動作，當我們攝製完竣而後，担憂這部片子在中國不會像在美國那樣受人歡迎，可是公映的時候，中國的觀衆竟趨之若驚。</p>
<p>「也許這部影片，所以這樣受人歡迎，中國電影觀衆的崇拜瑙瑪希拉，至少是原因之一。中國人的所以歡喜瑙瑪希拉，也自有原因，她的瘦弱而貌美，是完全符合於中國人理想中的美女的。」他說。</p>
<p>他又說起米高梅的女明星，除了瑙瑪希拉之外，中國人所最歡迎的，是珍妮麥唐娜。男明星當推克拉克蓋博爲第一。自一九三一年起，米高梅的出品，每年在上海租映的，大概自四十部至四十五部。至於香港和天津，也差不多是這樣</p>
<p>美國的影片，發行到全個世界，凡是在不通行英語的國家，另用字幕說明。而碰到有若干國家禁止聽英語的，那就用另一國語言的對白收音的。這件事情，有時會使你感到非常複雜，尤其是歌曲。</p>
<p>輕鬆的喜劇，歷史上的故事，和一般人所稱的「家庭影片，」這三種影片，在一九三八年度，米高梅視爲出品的中心。關於偉大的歌劇，此後是否將介紹到銀幕上面，據發言人所說，好萊塢的製片者，還在猶豫。因爲影片公司唯一的目的，是在賺錢，這種影片，是否能受美國觀衆歡迎，還沒有把握。上海更是不同，歡喜看這種影片的人怕不多。總之，影片公司所耗的錢，還是要向觀衆頭上取回來的。</p>
<h3>平劇古裝衣之區別</h3>
<p>— 禪翁</p>
<p>平　劇之女服，後臺置於二衣箱，如女蟒，女披，女官衣，宮衣，不論漢唐元明，一律服用。自梅蘭芳興，別創古裝衣，衆乃效之，然蘭芳之古裝衣，適用於古裝劇者，各劇有各劇之式樣，各人有各人之身份，如「黛玉葬花」之裝束，不能用之於「上元夫人」劇中也。</p>
<p>據戲劇家齊如山君言，蘭芳所創之古裝衣，都五十餘種，黛玉葬花用「春閨衣」「葬花衣」「拂苔衣」，嫦娥奔月用「採花衣」「仙宴衣」；天女散花用」天宮衣」「雲路衣」「雲臺衣」；麻姑上壽用「洞中衣」採藥衣」「上壽衣」；紅線盜盒用「飛行衣」，上元夫人用「天上衣」「承華衣」「靈眞衣」；　王別姬用「帳中衣」「楚宴衣」「創舞衣」；西施用「浣紗衣」「去國衣」「羽舞衣」　廊衣「回國衣」「遊湖衣」，太眞外傳用「入宮衣」「金烏衣」「燕居衣」「月宮衣」「　宮衣」「舞盤衣」「定情衣」「霓彩衣」「宛轉衣」「玉眞衣」·其他如廉錦楓，洛神，睛雯補裘，木蘭從軍，亦應不有特製之衣焉。</p>
<p>吾謂蘭芳所創之古裝衣，自爲梨園中闢一新途徑，所惜各劇衣飾，多大同小異，而上述古裝衣名目，又皆因劇施名，顧曲者觀之，第覺花紋新穎，式樣則固相類似也。我國二千年來之古裝，見於各代輿服志，散見於鐘鼎銅器刻石，及舊遺圖畫者，數蓋不尠，倘能參考進而更革之，則誠為梨園放一異彩矣。</p>
<h3>彈詞所用的樂器</h3>
<p>— 聿脩</p>
<p>彈　詞所用的樂器，最簡單不過，「獨檔頭」做，只是張弦子；就是「拼雙檔」，也不過多加只下手用的琵琶。前些時雖然也有人用過打琴，唱什麽「洋琴開篇」以爲號召的，但終究　花一現，未能持久；這和現在唱「文書開篇」用胡琴一樣，都是屬之於「噱頭勢」一方面的</p>
<p>學唱彈詞的初步功譯，就是「弄傢生」—學習弦子同琵琶。雖說弦子琵琶在樂器中都不能算是挺難學習的，但一樣也得要有音樂的天才。富有這種天才的，學起來感有興趣，可以事半而功倍；否則就只有一輩子的「碰痛」「碰痛」，始終不能夠入調。弦子比琵琶爲簡單，但是易學而難精，琵琶則反是，所以現在唱彈詞的也是精於弦子的少，而嫻熟琵琶的較多。</p>
<p>調理弦子，貴在剛柔疾徐，無不中節合拍，流利淸晰，鏗鏘動聽。通常在「唱詞」的時候，是間歇着的，以免弦音擾攪了篇子。就是「過門」，也是以少彈爲宜；彈多於唱，最易招致聽客的厭惡。　撥弄琵琶，貴在指法圓轉嫻熟，在抑揚婉轉中，音節歷歷不爽。與弦子合奏，則宜始終和諧，緊湊合拍，打成一片，呌聽客在和諧的音節中，得到一種美感。切忌琵琶弦子，各自爲政，甚且互爭雄長，不相合作，結果必致支離破碎，兩敗俱傷。</p>
<p>現在三弦老手，首推魏鈺卿，捧弦姿勢，既邊式好看，彈來復得心應手，操縱自如。小輩中僅鍾筱儂能彷彿一二，略有是處，自都以下，可不具論。至於徐雲志的「銅絲弦子」，識者譽之爲三弦中的野狐禪，聲音固然要比平常弦子，嘹喨許多，奈世無「鐵嗓子」堪以隨聲附和，所以「唱詞」終難免爲「銅弦」所掩，至有唱不勝彈，彈唱分家之譏。但自成一派，在上海也相當流行，奉之者有嚴雪亭邢瑞亭諸人，大都是徐的高足。琵琶自「琵琶大王」張步蟾物化之後，其子少蟾，以家學淵源，獨步書塲，逢到三六九，掛出大套琵琶招牌，用以號召，往往可賣滿座。弦子琵琶的合奏，則推沈薛同蔣朱　檔爲最，珠聯璧合，盡善盡美，極受聽客歡迎。</p>
<p>此外評話家中像黃兆麟田怡良同莫天鴻，都能琵琶。田黃不過在做「會書」的當兒，偶一「倒串」，而莫則就在平時，也常以大套琵琶作號召。因莫師事金筱棣，金父桂庭業唱落金扇，擅樂器，莫即間接從筱棣處得授金桂庭衣缽，故能以大套琵琶外爲金臺傳以外之贈品，大量孝敬聽客云。</p>
<h3>新艷秋戲裝</h3>
<p>— （珍）</p>
<h3>故都宮闈梨園秘史（一三三）</h3>
<p>— 徐慕雲</p>
<p>華容道釋曹的主因</p>
<p>照　好的方面說，借此可以讓雲長落一個義氣的名兒，按孔明的私心講，山人料事如神，今天可有個　證吧。雖說你輸了項上人頭，經你大哥保留下來，但是以後你總算有把柄在山人手裹，又那怕你不服我的調遣呢？以上所論，就是孔明知關公放曹，而他却故意讓他去放的原因。</p>
<p>本文中曾說過，古人重名分，慎出處，這兩句話才是孔明華容釋曹的主因呢。試想曹操果然在這時被擒，諸葛亮還是把這個名爲漢相的奸雄殺了的好，還是解往天子駕前的好呢。姑且不問曹操的被擒被斬，劉備既簪漢室除了一害，當然天子要特別封賞皇叔，或者就命他攝行丞相職權，像曹操一樣的尊崇，再不然加封個甚麽王位，這可算尊崇到極點了吧，然而這父與諸葛亮什麽相干呢？俗語說「腦袋大不過帽子去，有帽子在頭上罩着，孔明無論怎樣是要屈居劉備之下的。劉備要是只有個空王位，孔明全多也不過是個司徒等類的官兒，這樣，他又何必出他的茅廬呢？况且劉玄德本是個懷有大志的梟雄，他因爲早懷了個「天下者人人之天下也」的念頭。所以才去冒着風雪，三顧伏龍於茅廬，他如此重視人才，並不是爲國求賢，實實在在是爲了他個人的基業。同待諸葛先生也是爲扶保劉備稱帝而來，故而才肯發展了他的抱負，假使能打成一統天下，不用說劉備登了大寶，稱了皇帝，而他也就是開國元勳，大丞相，一字並肩王了。縱令退一步，弄到個鼎足三分的局面，他也可以稱丞相，總攬軍政大權的。玄德，孔明，他二人的志向既是如此，可見殺了曹操之後，接替他的職權道些事兒，全非他們的本意了。要說玄德也傚法後來曹操的行徑，甚或廢了漢帝自立爲天子，這樣篡奪的事情，不但他不能作，就是重名分慎出處的諸葛先生，也是不得讓他作的。可是華容道要是眞把曹操擒來殺了，敢問劉備除了個篡奪江山的辦法，又有個甚麼好主意才能自己稱大皇帝呢？</p>
<h3>播音圈裏的花花絮絮（一）</h3>
<p>— 筆花</p>
<p>筆　者前在本刋作了一篇「播音生活」之後，　時曾接到不少讀者的來信，　我再寫一篇關於播音員的　史和狀況，這事如果要不厭　煩的說起來，不是三言兩語可以說完的。的確，現在的報章和雜誌，對於播音員的紀載，很少很少，這是讀者們急於要知道的一件事。因了播音員和遊藝界有密切的關係，筆者趁此機會，源源本本，分門別類地寫將出來，借重本刋寶貴的篇幅，發表一下，諒必愛讀本報及愛聽無綫電的聽衆們，深表同情的吧！如今先從話劇談起，以後還有彈詞，評話，故事，申曲，歌唱，四明文書，甬　，南方戲，維揚戲，滑稽等，常陸續貢獻給本報讀者。</p>
<p>（一）話劇</p>
<p>電台上的播送話劇，要算顧雷音最早，他在舞台上並不怎麽紅，可是一上電台，就紅得發紫。他本來是話劇家，把舞台劇改爲播音劇，也有幕表，比舞台上還要分得淸楚，利用口齒伶俐，討好聽衆，加以男女演員，搭配齊全，有哭有笑，繪聲繪色，不過沒有舞台上那樣生龍活虎的表情罷了；這全仗一言一語中透露出來，最使聽衆聽了着迷的，就是配音，例如開門關門上扶梯等的小動作，都會在空氣中很深刻描寫出來，一切的聲音，描摹得淋漓盡致，刻劃入微，聽了好像身入其境，樂而忘返，全體角色，都由他親自領導，有時他自己也加入播音，非常認眞。據他對人說，同樣是話劇，可是電台上的話劇，和舞台上的話劇完全不同，而且電台上的話劇要難上幾倍，在聽的人好像是很平常的，播的人却戰戰兢兢，不能絲毫苟且的，又要懂得各地方言，什麽人應當說什麽話，舞台上有時還可以媽虎過去，電台上一舉一動，聰明的聽衆不肯放你過門，說錯了，就要打電話來責問。尤其是對白，最要留神，二個人的對白，一來一往，却還容易，最難的就是有許多人在一起，這種對白，最不容易，非要頭頭是道，分晰淸楚不可，否則一不留意，就會露出馬腳來，因爲往往一個人兼飾兩種角色，當然有兩種不同的語氣，這就覺得難了，所以顧雷音的話劇在電台上能夠始終受人歡迎，原因就在認眞從事。</p>
<h3>難民協會同鄉組　歡宴常錫戲七班領袖</h3>
<p>定四月二三號在大陸播音</p>
<p>上　海難民救濟協會同鄉組定四月七·八·九號三天，假座貴州路湖社舉行常錫戲七班聯合大會串，前晚，同鄉組假座大發食品公司歡宴常錫戲的七班領袖黃翠芳，王培根，沈化南，陳梅森，張茂生，陳阿九，楊竇童等，由總幹事胡壽祺，曹志功担任招待。席間，各班領袖報吿推銷座券的總數，大概可以超出一千餘元，胡君站在常州同鄉的地位，希望常錫戲參加這次的救難運動，能夠使社會人士有深刻的印象，提高牠在遊藝界的地位。對於銷票方面，並盼各班作最後的努力，造成更美滿的成續，最後議決在四月二·三號兩天假座大陸電台舉行推銷座券播音宜傳，由各班最優秀的演員參加，這次的宴會，可算盡歡而散。</p>
<h3>劉寶全不日到滬</h3>
<p>仍在大中華飯店演唱</p>

<p>本刋昨接具名爲「上海人民建設委員會一來函云：撤吿上海電影界以後須照左列指示方針攝製影片，否則即係附和敵人的腐化政策，應予以制裁。</p>
<p>一，須認議電影界抗戰建國的責任。二，仍須奉行中央電影審查會的法則·三，絕對不許攝恐怖片和荒淫片。四，不許編排以愛情爲主題之腳本。五，多拍有啟發民智的教育片。六，對白須多用驚惕的語句。</p>

<p>Xingji: Zhou Yuming, platoon leader of a guerilla detachment of a certain Chinese division, led thirty soldiers to launch an attack from Qianzhuang, Fenyang, on the morning of the 19th, advancing towards Longzhao Cliff. Passing the foot of Jiajia Cliff, he discovered that over a thousand Japanese troops were moving from Fenyang west towards Wuchengzhen.

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>Beware of Another Peace Smoke Screen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Associated Press in London reported that British Foreign Secretary Halifax had discussed the Far East issue when he met with Chinese Ambassador to Britain Guo Taiqi. It is rumored that the British Foreign Secretary said that due to the expansion of German forces, Britain and France would not have time to attend to the East. At the same time, the issue of a meeting between the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, and the British Ambassador to China, Kerr, in Shanghai is also receiving attention. We know that whenever Japan launches an attack on an important Chinese city, there is always a message of peace or a similar message corresponding in the international community. If the emergence of this kind of news is not due to the lack of understanding of China's war of resistance by a few international figures, it must be a trick by Japan to release a smoke screen by using the actions of diplomatic officials of various countries, in order to indirectly achieve its "peace seeking" goal. At a time when Chinese and Japanese armies are engaged in fierce fighting in Nanchang, it is naturally not surprising that a bizarre message that Britain and France have no time to attend to the East and that the British ambassadors to Japan and China will hold a meeting has emerged from London. Now we dare to make a formal announcement to the international community: this Chinese war of resistance is a demand for the survival of the entire nation, and no matter how the international situation changes, it will never stop until the final victory is won. With China's abundant manpower and material resources, and the sympathetic assistance of various countries in the world, even if a major change occurs in Europe, causing one or two friendly countries to be unable to attend to the Far East issue, it will not be enough to affect the future of China's war of resistance; even if one or two important cities continue to fall, it has long been regarded as an inevitable phenomenon in the initial stage of the war of resistance, and it will not be enough to affect the overall situation and frustrate the determination of the Chinese army and people to resist the war.</p>
<p>If international figures are worried that they will not be able to attend to the East because of events in Europe, and want to urge China to "take care of itself as soon as possible," they fundamentally do not recognize that world peace cannot be separated. Is China not a part of the world! In recent years, under the aggressive front of European and Asian fascism, China's war of resistance is of course for its own survival and independence, but it is also for the peace and security of Europe and even the world. If European democratic countries are now trying to save the European crisis created by European fascism, but instead want to order China to be subjected to the aggression and domination of Asian fascist forces, that is not only unjust and inhumane, but they themselves will also suffer harm. Because they attach importance to the European situation and give up the Far East; or to concentrate the strength of the European democratic front and temporarily seek compromise in the Far East; or to imply with a compromising attitude that they hope that European and Asian fascism will temporarily maintain peace in Europe and Asia in a state of "stopping at the right time," these are all extremely wrong policies that are easily trapped in the traps set by fascism and increase the crisis of democratic countries.</p>
<p>The aggressive actions of fascism are, in fact, endless; the final territorial demands put forward by Hitler in Europe have been repeated again and again. Is Japan in Asia not the same! To take the recent situation as an example, not long ago Japan claimed that it would soon open Qingdao and allow ships from third parties to dock at the outer port. Japan stated that this was its real effort to satisfy the wishes of third parties, and London also expressed great welcome to this news. In fact, this is just a piece of lip service from Japan. Whether this piece of lip service can be realized is of course still a question. Even if it can be realized, it is worth considering to what extent it can satisfy third parties. Japan has previously assured European and American countries that it respects their rights and interests in China, but what has its actual performance been like? In the past twenty months of the Sino-Japanese War, which day has not seen the rights and interests of third parties damaged by Japan? Some people say that the value of the guarantees put forward by Germany in the Munich Agreement is not as good as the cost of buying the paper for signing the agreement. Japan's lip service is certainly far inferior!</p>
<p>To take a step back, even if this kind of lip service from Japan can be realized, under Japan's military control, the so-called opening of Qingdao is actually very limited for the interests of third parties: Japan has completely implemented control over finance, currency, trade, and transportation construction in its occupied areas, and third parties can find no other benefits besides being able to dock their ships in the outer port of Qingdao. Moreover, while this kind of lip service from Japan is not easy to say, it is not difficult to cancel it. Yesterday's newspaper reported that Japan will again blockade the traffic on the Pearl River, only allowing Japanese ships to come and go freely, which is a clear example. It is believed that this kind of bone-spitting policy of giving benefits after eating the meat will never be easily deceived by politicians with a long-term vision.</p>
<p>Now, Japan has not yet made any actual representation of its so-called genuine efforts to satisfy the wishes of third parties, but it has already taken practical actions to step up the work of repelling the influence of third parties in China. The concessions north of the Suzhou River in Shanghai have recently been regarded by a Japanese spokesman in Shanghai as an occupied area of the Japanese army, which is clearly Japan's beginning to deny the existence of foreign concessions in China. According to yesterday's Mainland News, the puppet "Reformed Government" in Nanjing has begun to implement an extremely strong anti-foreign movement, and has openly put forward slogans such as tearing up the British flag, severing economic ties with Britain, confiscating British property in China, taking back all British concessions, expelling all British people in the country, and not cooperating with the British. This kind of action by the puppet is actually a trick by Japan. Japan slightly gives lip service on the one hand, indicating the slow progress of its aggressive actions; on the other hand, it directs the puppet to actively engage in the work of eradicating foreign rights and interests in China. It uses the fact that various democratic countries do not recognize puppet organizations, and stands on the position of not interfering with puppet organizations itself, so that European and American democratic countries have no chance to protest against the loss of their rights and interests in China, not to mention any guarantee of safety. What a poisonous means of aggression this is!</p>
<p>If the democratic countries of the world want to curb the aggression of fascism, any policy of compromise and concession can no longer be effective. How can the loss of a few important strongholds in the Chinese war of resistance affect the overall situation! Only by uniting together and "striking those who strike" can we maintain the peace of the whole world.</p>

<h3>Military Commission Announces One Week of Battle Situation</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) The spokesperson for the Military Commission discussed the battle situation for the week (23rd to 29th). The fighting in western Zhejiang and northern Jiangxi was relatively intense. In particular, in northern Jiangxi, the enemy forces exhausted their naval, land, and air power, launching fierce attacks on us from multiple routes, starting last week and continuing until this week. Our entire army, under the command of the supreme commander, fought bloody battles for over ten days. The heavy losses inflicted on the enemy and the thorough exhaustion of their combat effectiveness were unprecedented since the defense of Wuhan. Furthermore, the battles on the other fronts were mostly sporadic. A summary is provided below:</p>
<p>"Northern Jiangxi Front": After suffering heavy losses and having their aggressive momentum blunted when they attacked Duchang and Wucheng on both sides of Poyang Lake last week, the enemy forces changed their strategy, dispatching several tens of thousands of troops to attack Wuning and Nanchang. The enemy attacking Wuning split into two routes from Zhuxi, one heading west and the other invading south, and suffered heavy casualties after repeated attacks by our forces. Moreover, we killed enemy regimental commanders Yabiiwa Takeo and Ejima Torao, battalion commander Takaki Tamaki, and dozens of other important officers. We successively recovered the key points of Danojian, Jabaibai, Huijiayou, Wangrennao, Jinjishan, Fenghuang, Jidongkou, and Luopo. Our positions remained unshaken, and we are currently engaged in a bloody battle in the northeastern region of Wuning. The enemy attacking Nanchang crossed the river from Yongxiu Qiujin after noon on the 21st and launched attacks on Gouziling, Tanxi, Mantoushan, Anyi, and Fengxin. Our officers and soldiers braved intense enemy poison gas, artillery fire, and bombs, engaging in fierce combat. In the Battle of Mantoushan, more than 2,000 enemy soldiers, including the Iino Regimental Commander, were completely wiped out. In the Battle of Fengxin, the enemy Miyazaki Regimental Commander also died in succession. Thereafter, our forces and the enemy engaged in fierce battles in Wucheng, Wanjiabu, and Shengmi Street. Another part of the enemy forces once harassed the northeast of Gaoan, but was bravely repelled by our forces. Currently, our army is engaged in a decisive battle with the enemy in the vicinity of Nanchang.</p>
<p>"Guangdong Front": The enemy in Guangzhou continues to increase their forces from Qiongzhou Island and the West River, continuing to construct fortifications with no unusual movements. Enemy planes have repeatedly flown over Gulao, Yangmei, Sanzhao, Yingwan, and Sucun, causing no significant losses to us. The enemy advancing from Fengbiao towards Junwo has been repeatedly attacked by our attacking troops, resulting in over a hundred enemy casualties, and we have seized many war trophies. Enemy artillery at Makou has been continuously shelling Jinli in recent days, attempting to cross the river, but they were suppressed by counterattacks. On the 23rd, several hundred enemy infantry and artillery personnel attacked Jiupu Fen from Shendaigang, engaging in a fierce battle with one of our units for several hours. The enemy abandoned over a hundred corpses and retreated along the original route. The enemy at Daliang has been heavily attacked by us in recent days, suffering extremely heavy casualties and panicking. Enemy warships at sea have been showing signs of activity in the Beihai and Shantou areas in recent days. On the morning of the 26th, they advanced near Beihai, and the enemy warships deployed smoke screens. Our artillery fire forced them to retreat. At noon on the same day, over a hundred enemy soldiers who landed in Shantou were more than half annihilated by our garrison troops. The remaining enemy soldiers fled back to their ships. Currently, the sea is calm everywhere.</p>
<p>"Jiangsu-Zhejiang Front": After the arrival of our new troops in northern Jiangsu, we launched a counteroffensive and attacked the enemy's rear lines. The counties of Lianshui, Siyang, and Shuyang have been successively captured by our officers and soldiers in recent days with unstoppable momentum. The enemy's deputy commander of Yangzhou, Miyakawa, was also killed. Now, we are continuing to besiege Huai'an on one hand and advancing towards the East China Sea on the other, taking advantage of the victory. The enemy has suffered repeated defeats and their momentum is exhausted. The enemy in Jin Tan in southern Jiangsu and Wuxing and Changxing in western Zhejiang is currently increasing in number, threatening to attack Liyang, Yixing, and Jin Tan. The enemy has twice harassed northern Liyang this week, and the enemy in Changxing also once advanced towards Meishan and Si'an, but were repelled in an encounter. The enemy suffered heavy casualties and are still eager to try to cross the Fuchun River to attack Dongzhou. After our counterattack on the afternoon of the 23rd, we took advantage of the victory to cross the river and pursue them, also using surprise troops to cut off the enemy's rear. The enemy was attacked from both sides, suffering hundreds of casualties. Currently, Zhoujiapu and Lingjiaqiao on the north bank have been successively recovered, and the remaining enemy soldiers have been completely eliminated. The vanguard is approaching Ningyang, launching fierce attacks on the enemy entrenched in Hangzhou. Currently, the enemy troops in both locations are extremely terrified.</p>
<p>"Hubei Front": The enemy forces in northern Hubei have been transporting supplies frequently recently, engaged in replenishment and reorganization, and have not made any sudden moves. The enemy at Luohansi and Sigang in northern Hubei, on the 24th and 25th, advanced towards the vicinity of Shayang and Zhangjiachang, using artillery and machine gun cover, attempting to forcibly cross the river with dozens of civilian boats and rubber rafts. We fiercely bombarded them, sinking many boats, and the enemy suffered over 400 casualties, fleeing back to the east bank. At the same time, our army in Shayang dispatched a surprise force, crossed the river, and besieged the enemy in the area of Duobaowan, engaging in a fierce battle with the enemy at Caijiaxiang, annihilating a large number of the enemy. As of the 27th, we were still engaged in a standoff with the enemy in the northeastern region of Duobaowan. To counter the enemy's assault on southern Hubei, our forces repeatedly launched fierce attacks on the enemy at Tongshan, Baini Bridge, Chongyang, Shichengwan, Wuning, and Changqingshan on the 23rd and 24th, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. In the battle of Qingshan, an enemy regimental commander was killed. Our army in eastern Hubei, after a bloody battle on the 26th, captured Xishui County, killing over 300 enemy soldiers. The enemy fled in disarray towards Macheng, and we are pursuing them, joining forces with our army in that area. The enemy at Guanyi suffered extremely heavy casualties.</p>
<p>"Henan Front": Over 1,600 enemy soldiers in Wen County, with many artillery pieces, advanced towards us in two routes on the 23rd, engaging in a fierce battle with our army near Zhaoxianji, Liushizhuang, Nanwangzhen, and Zuolicun. The enemy made no significant progress. Subsequently, another unit of ours ambushed the enemy's flanks, cutting off the enemy's rear, and they urgently fled east. By evening, all the remaining enemy soldiers in various locations were cleared. Over 4,000 enemy soldiers at Yuenan Yuebao, Mazhuang, Wangwu, Shuangjing, Yangqiao, and Laitongzhai originally intended to attack Huayuankou, but due to our continuous brave counterattacks, our main force also attacked from the rear. The enemy was attacked from both sides and gradually became unsustainable, fleeing in different routes. One route retreated to Kangcun, about a thousand soldiers; one route retreated to Yuanwu, about three to four hundred soldiers; and one route retreated to Kaifeng, about two thousand soldiers. Currently, all those areas have been fully recovered. Our army attacking Xinyang, Luotuo Shop, Xinji, and Youhe, after a fierce battle for two days and one night starting on the 24th, has recovered Xinji and Luotuo Shop. The remaining enemy soldiers at Youhe are being continuously besieged and annihilated. The enemy suffered extremely heavy casualties in this battle, which was an unprecedented major blow to the enemy in southern Henan in recent months. Currently, our army has formed a siege around Xinyang, and the enemy stubbornly resisting in the isolated city will surely be captured in one fell swoop. Furthermore, Fushan in Shanxi Province, after being captured by us last week, was reinforced by over 3,000 enemy soldiers from Yicheng and Linfen this week. Starting on the 23rd, they launched a large-scale counterattack in multiple routes, engaging in an extremely fierce battle with our army at Hancun, Guanzhi, and Xucun. We employed mobile tactics, killing many enemy soldiers, and the enemy's offensive has been exhausted. In Anhui Province, after our army captured Wangjiang last week, we launched a counterattack on the entire south bank this week starting on the 26th. On the morning of the 27th, we launched attacks in two routes against the enemy in Qingyang and Tongling, making very smooth progress. One route attacked Shun'an Town. "East of Tongling" has occupied Liangqiao Village and Gualing. "Northwest of Qingyang" has recovered the areas of Wubushan and Fenghuangshan. In recent days, we have been advancing in separate routes, directly approaching the vicinity of Tongling and Qingyang, besieging the enemy. The enemy is stubbornly resisting in the city, but countless of them have been killed by us. The recovery of the county seat is imminent. Our artillery fire has been continuously attacking enemy warships sailing on the Yangtze River. One warship was hit by more than twenty shells and burned at that time. (Telegraph from the 29th)</p>

The Japanese army in Yueyang, under pressure from all sides, is in a critical situation. From the 25th to the 28th, they have been closing all four gates every day, firing dense artillery fire indiscriminately at nearby areas, appearing increasingly panicked. (2) The water levels of both the Yangtze River and Dongting Lake have recently receded, making it even more difficult for Japanese warships to operate. (Telegraph from the 29th)</p>

<p>(Changsha) The guerrillas operating in southern Hubei, from a certain unit, have penetrated deep into the Yangtze River coast. On the morning of the 21st, they scouted that three Japanese warships were sailing up from Xunyang. They pre-ambushed near Banbishan and waited for them to approach, using specially equipped artillery to launch destructive fire, hitting all the Japanese warships. Two were severely damaged and unable to sail, anchoring on the Jiangmian of Huangsang Estuary. Another one was wounded and sailed upstream, sinking on the Jiangmian of Xinchun. The Japanese side, suffering this surprise attack, is now using aircraft to cover navigation between Xunyang and Hankou (Telegraph from the 29th).</p>

<h3>People Along the Shaanxi-Sichuan Highway Strive for New Construction</h3>
<p>Connecting the Ancient Bao-Han to Lianyungang Plank Road, Vehicles Weighing Over Seven Tons Can Now Pass</p>
<p>(Chengdu) A reporter from the Central News Agency arrived in Chengdu on the 28th via the Xia-Chuan Highway from Bin County, taking five days for the journey. After a brief inspection along the way, he deeply felt that the construction of this road has made rapid progress. Although there are mountains such as Qinling and Fengling with altitudes of 2,000 meters, the road surface is smooth and wide, making travel enjoyable. Small bridges can also be crossed by vehicles weighing over seven tons. This is the only land transportation route connecting the southwest and northwest. Transportation tools along the way include automobiles, rickshaws, and manpower carts, shuttling back and forth in an endless stream, truly creating a prosperous scene. This road was built by connecting the ancient Bao-Han to Lianyungang Plank Road. The remains of the plank road no longer exist. The dangers of the so-called "sky ladder乌道" of the past and the difficulty of the Shu Road will also disappear with it. The distance from Baoji to Chengdu is 700 kilometers. The reconstruction of the stone-based road surface began in the 26th year. Now, along the long journey, one can see people digging mountains and repairing bridges everywhere, continuing to work hard on new construction. In just two years, transportation construction has made rapid progress. This is truly a significant achievement in China's anti-Japanese war and national construction. New inns have been set up at the stations along the way. The China Travel Service's guest house at the Zhangliang Shrine in Liuba has also opened for business, making travel more convenient. Along the way, one can view historical sites of the Han and Wei dynasties, famous scenic spots of the Three Kingdoms, and amidst the winding mountains, there are also奇景 of flowers blooming below the ridge and snow accumulating above the ridge, making for a 清心眼 on the dusty journey.

<h3>Puppet Army of Guo Dejun Completely Eliminated</h3>
<p>(Luoyang) Guo Dejun, a traitor of the puppet "Imperial Collaboration Army" in Tongxu, was completely eliminated by the Huo Tengguang Unit of the Tongxu Joint Defense Team in Liancheng on the 15th of this month. Over 500 rifles and 12 machine guns were seized, and over 300 prisoners were captured. Guo Dejun barely escaped with his life and his whereabouts are unknown. (Telegraph from the 29th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Plane Bombs Shangyu, Baiguan</h3>
<p>Sichuan Also Attacked</p>
<p>Ningbo A Japanese plane dropped three bombs in Baiguan at 2:00 PM on the 28th, destroying seven houses. It then flew to Songxia in Shangyu, dropping one bomb, killing one person and injuring two. (Telegraph from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Eighteen Japanese planes invaded Sichuan Province from Hubei Province at 10:08 AM on the 29th, dropping bombs in Liangshan and other places at 11:49 AM. The local air defense department issued an air raid alert at that time. It was later reported that the Japanese planes had fled eastward, and the air defense department lifted the alert at 12:23 PM. (Telegraph from the 29th)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) This city has issued air raid alerts twice in 24 hours, but Japanese planes have not come. At 9:00 PM last night, when the streets were bustling with pedestrians and the theaters and restaurants were full of customers, the alarm suddenly sounded. The scene at that time was extremely tense. The crowd rushed to take shelter, each seeking a safe place. Automobiles, public buses, trucks, rickshaws, and sedans scattered and sped away. The sidewalks were full of pedestrians. Searchlights illuminated the sky, searching for Japanese planes. An hour later, the alarm was lifted. Some believed that the alarm was issued to test the defenses against night raids. At noon today, the alarm went off again. Chinese fighter planes were seen patrolling the skies above the city, but no Japanese planes were seen. The alarm was soon lifted. It is heard that the second alarm in Chongqing was issued because eighteen Japanese bombers were spotted over Wanxian. However, after the Japanese planes passed Wanxian, they turned back, and Wanxian has probably been bombed. (Reuters Telegraph from the 27th)</p>
<h3>Interest on Sino-French Loans, etc., Will Still Be Paid</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Someone asked a well-informed source to clarify the recent remarks made by President Kong, who also serves as Minister of Finance, regarding loans secured by customs duties and salt tax. The response was that the Chinese government announced on January 15th of this year that it would suspend payment of loans secured by customs duties, but regarding long-term debts of the loans, it was preparing to allocate funds to be stored in the Central Bank. On March 26th, Kong announced that the government was now beginning negotiations to properly resolve the debts of loans secured by customs duties and salt tax, thus placing loans secured by salt tax on an equal footing with loans secured by customs duties. In other words, Kong has announced that the Chinese government will also suspend payment of loans secured by salt tax in the future. However, a portion of the interest due on the Cripps Loan on March 30th and the Sino-French Loan coupons due on April 5th will be paid as usual, because financial institutions have sufficient funds set aside for this purpose.

<h3>Roosevelt Approves Construction of Two 45,000-Ton Battleships Chief of the British Army Staff Leads Military Experts to Paris Closely Discussing Military Cooperation Plans to Resist Aggression</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt recently declared when meeting with newspaper reporters that he had decided to allow the Navy Department to build two 45,000-ton battleships. This move was due to the Japanese government's refusal to explain its shipbuilding plans. In addition, there are other reasons, which are difficult to tell. (Havas Telegraph from the 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The White House recently announced this afternoon that the Navy Department's proposal to build two 45,000-ton battleships in the 1940 fiscal year has been approved by President Roosevelt. The department has also submitted a bill to Congress requesting permission to exceed the battleship tonnage limit set by the London Naval Treaty (35,000 tons). Well-informed sources here recently stated that the government's decision to build giant battleships was based on two reasons: first, it was rumored that Japan was building battleships exceeding 35,000 tons; second, the situation in Europe was deteriorating. Naval officials said that since Germany, Italy, and Japan were linked by the Anti-Comintern Pact, the United States had to consider the naval strength of Germany and Italy and strengthen the Far East Fleet. However, some members of Congress are opposed to the construction of 45,000-ton battleships, intending to allow for an increase in battleship tonnage only after carefully investigating the content of Japan's shipbuilding plans.

<p>(London) Lieutenant General Gort, Chief of the Army General Staff, led many military experts to Paris today to hold talks with French military authorities. Military officials here said that the nature of the talks was very important, especially focusing on the mutual cooperation between the British and French air force authorities. In addition, French Aviation Minister Laurent-Eynac is also scheduled to come to London next week to discuss the adjustment of the aircraft manufacturing industries of Britain and France with British authorities. (Havas Telegraph from the 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Lieutenant General Gort, Chief of the British Army General Staff, at the invitation of French Chief of General Staff General Gamelin, came to France to conduct a major exercise and inspect the Maginot Line. He recently arrived at Le Bourget Airport near Paris at 3:40 PM this afternoon, accompanied by many military experts from London. General Gamelin, German Chief of Staff General Lang, Air Force Chief of Staff General Villemin, and many other dignitaries welcomed him at the airport. According to certain sources, the British military delegation came here to discuss with the French military authorities a plan for practical cooperation between Britain and France in military matters to resist future aggression. (Havas Telegraph from the 28th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Mail recently published in a prominent position the news that Lieutenant General Gort, Chief of the Army General Staff, went to France to conduct military alliance negotiations, stating that the British government, in view of the needs of the environment, has the confidence to conclude a military alliance as soon as possible. Now that Lieutenant General Gort is rapidly going to France is probably for this purpose. It is said that the alliance will extend to Poland, Romania, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. If the above countries are attacked from the outside, they will be given military assistance. The newspaper continued that Britain will continuously supply information to the United States on the progress of the negotiations. It is also learned that the Soviet Union will not join the alliance temporarily. (Haitong Telegraph from the 29th)</p>
<h3>British Attitude Toward Germany Is More Active Than Rumored Chamberlain Declares in the House of Commons That the Four-Nation Declaration Is Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>(London) According to political news obtained by Reuters, some believe that the draft declaration proposed by Britain is purely a proposal for mutual cooperation in the event that Germany continues to commit aggression in the future, which is not true. It is said that Britain believes that the time is not yet ripe for Britain to make a blatant expression. It can be seen from Prime Minister Chamberlain's statement in the House of Commons that the actions that the British government has in mind are far beyond any consultations. At the same time, negotiations between the governments of Britain, France, Russia, and Poland are continuing, but it is generally expected that Poland's attitude will have to wait until Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck comes to London in April before it can mature.

<p>(London) During this afternoon's meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Chamberlain replied to an inquiry from a certain member of parliament, saying that the government is actively exchanging views with other governments on various issues arising from the recent events. However, before results are achieved, it is not convenient to reveal the details. Opposition Labor Party member of parliament Greenwood then asked whether the draft joint declaration that the government had proposed to a certain country's government advocated that the countries concerned should consult each other when necessary, or contained military constraints. Prime Minister Chamberlain replied again that the government's plan goes a step further than mutual consultation. If you carefully consider what I said just now, you will know it. Another opposition Labor Party member of parliament, Dalton, asked what kind of proposals the government had made to Poland. Prime Minister Chamberlain also replied that Britain was ready to take action under certain circumstances and had clearly informed the countries concerned when exchanging views. The House of Commons may submit the discussion on this issue before the Easter holiday. (Havas Telegraph from the 28th)</p>
<h3>Chamberlain Announces Expansion of the Army</h3>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Chamberlain declared in the House of Commons today that the government has decided to immediately place the National Defense Force of 130,000, which is currently on a peacetime basis, on a wartime basis and will increase it by approximately 40,000. The field army of the National Defense Force will be handled in the same way, and its number will be doubled. (Reuters Telegraph from the 29th)</p>
<p>(London) During this afternoon's meeting of the House of Commons, Prime Minister Chamberlain stated that the number of reservists is currently 130,000, and it is expected to increase to 170,000 to supplement the wartime quota, and then double again to reach 340,000. It is necessary for the people to enthusiastically join the army, and members of parliament will be able to inform the people of this. (Havas Telegraph from the 29th)</p>
<h3>English Proposal by 34 Members of British Parliament to Implement a Strong Policy</h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the issuance of a declaration to resist aggressor nations, the British government has been negotiating with various peace-loving European countries. The Cabinet held a meeting at noon today to discuss the progress. This move is highly valued by members of Parliament. Well-informed sources also said that the countries concerned are still negotiating, and a Cabinet subcommittee is closely monitoring the situation. Chamberlain is said to have declared that the Cabinet intends to take a very important stand. In addition, the War Office submitted a report on "latent forces," which the Cabinet will discuss. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Today, thirty-four members of Parliament, including Eden, Churchill, Tuffnell, Cooper, Sandys, and Baron Winterton, jointly proposed the implementation of a strong foreign policy. The motion stated: "Continuous acts of aggression have occurred in Europe, and the pressure on smaller countries has increased. The United Kingdom and the entire British Empire have been severely threatened. In the opinion of this House, these threats can only be addressed by implementing the strong foreign policy recently proposed by the Foreign Secretary. Furthermore, to cope with this arduous task, the government should be reorganized on the broadest possible scale, entrusting all of the nation's industries, financial resources, and manpower to it, so that this country can exert its maximum military power in the shortest possible time." (Associated Press, 29th)</p>
<p>(London) Important members of the Conservative Party in the House of Commons, such as former Foreign Secretary Eden, former First Lord of the Admiralty Tuffnell Cooper, Admiral Sir Keyes, and extreme party leader Churchill, jointly proposed a motion this afternoon stating that the United Kingdom and the entire British Empire have been seriously threatened, and the government must "actively implement the foreign policy advocated by Lord Halifax" and form a national cabinet on a broad scale, granting it full power to control industries and manage resources, so that if necessary, the country can be put on a wartime footing in the shortest possible time. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Lord Davies proposed a motion in the House of Lords today, mentioning the possibility of an international economic boycott against Germany. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Former Foreign Secretary Eden delivered a broadcast speech to the Commonwealth of Australia, stating, "All civilized countries must preserve their fundamental beliefs while improving the lives of their people. 1938 was the most critical year in British history. The impact of all events is still difficult to determine. Partisanship is deep, and empty arguments are of no practical help. Six months ago, people generally believed that European countries had reached a period of peace and cooperation. However, after the European events of the past month, politicians learned a lesson, and partisanship was swept away. Today, the world recognizes that a crisis exists. This is because a certain country has used its military power and abused its authority in this world of cunning and plunder, which has led to this. International confidence has been hit, and the idea of respecting international constraints, which is the foundation of civilization, has been completely destroyed. All these obvious facts are undeniable. Since the policies of a certain country are based on force, peace-loving countries have no other way to go but to unite and resist aggressor nations. If we can resolutely follow this path, we can force countries that worship force to realize that aggression is unprofitable and further re-establish international order and restore the belief in respecting international constraints. Only in this way can world civilization avoid catastrophe. All that has been said is my personal opinion, and I would like to state this as an addendum." (Havas, 29th)</p>
<h3>Tensions in German-Polish Relations: German Ambassador Moltke Visits Polish Foreign Minister; Newspapers Begin Anti-Polish Propaganda</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck met with German Ambassador Moltke yesterday for a lengthy meeting. The content of the conversation was kept extremely secret by officials, which has attracted great attention from political circles. It is pointed out that after numerous anti-German demonstrations in Poland in recent days, German newspapers have been attacking the Polish authorities, believing that the 1934 German-Polish Agreement has not been implemented. Therefore, it is believed that the Polish Foreign Minister's meeting with the German Ambassador yesterday must have been to discuss this matter. (Haitong, 29th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: German Ambassador to Poland Moltke visited Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck last night. The outcome of the talks did not lead to any progress in the situation. It is widely believed that Foreign Minister Beck may have stated to Moltke that the Polish government has no intention of joining an anti-German bloc and abandoning the 1934 German-Polish non-aggression pact. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: After numerous anti-German demonstrations in Bromberg in recent days, the German people there are extremely indignant. The entrances of some German shops have been painted with the words "Enemies Here" in black oil by Poles, and German residences have also been marked. Local police arrested two Polish students yesterday in an attempt to suppress the demonstrations. (Haitong, 28th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The semi-official German News Agency recently issued a message stating that after incitement by Polish newspapers, anti-German demonstrations have occurred in certain places in Poland. The windows of the residences of German residents in Margonine, Pomerania Province, have been broken, and one German has been stabbed several times and seriously injured. Accidents have also occurred in other places. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The "Hamburg Daily" published an article stating that Poland's joining the British-led anti-German bloc is contrary to German-Polish understanding. The newspaper mentioned Polish Foreign Minister Colonel Beck's upcoming visit to London, saying, "Last September, when Poland joined Germany and Hungary in liberating their minorities in Czechoslovakia, Western countries expressed great dissatisfaction. Now that Germany has gained leadership in Central Europe, British diplomacy is doing its best to win over Poland to build a defense line against Germany. However, although Polish officials are under pressure from abroad, they can still maintain a correct attitude. This is because of the existence of German-Polish understanding, which cannot be destroyed by the anti-German plans of British government's chief diplomatic advisor Vansittart. It is true that Polish policy is often opposed by traditional anti-German figures, but most public opinion is still quite able to abide by the obligations of German-Polish understanding." (Haitong, 29th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Polish government party leader General Sławomir Skwarczyński said in a speech at a party meeting that all Polish people see the approach of a great crisis. We must work hard to seek peace. We will never allow ourselves to be swayed by any pressure, and we must not participate in any plan that is detrimental to our neighbors. We are willing to fight to the end for the honor and independence of our borders, in order to achieve victory. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: General Sławomir Skwarczyński, leader of the Polish "National Unity Association," delivered a speech to the leaders of the association's branches last night, pointing out that recent events in Central and Southeastern Europe, although not unexpected, have put Poland in an extremely dangerous situation. Skwarczyński continued, "However, the principles of Polish foreign policy do not change, and maintaining peace remains its consistent goal. Therefore, Poland will do its best to maintain friendly relations with all its neighbors. Poland does not want to commit aggression against its neighbors, whether to the east or to the west, and at the same time, it will never succumb to any pressure." (Haitong, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Local politicians are extremely regretful about the anti-German demonstrations that have occurred in Poland in recent days, believing that they are an organized attempt to destroy German-Polish cooperation. This cooperation has been based since the signing of the German-Polish non-aggression treaty in 1934. Officials maintain a silent attitude towards the Polish demonstrations. However, the "Essen National Daily," the mouthpiece of General Göring, stated that the demonstrations in Poland have made German-Polish relations unbearably tense. If the Polish authorities want to maintain diplomatic relations with Germany, they must take steps to suppress reaction and protect the safety of German lives and property. (Haitong, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After the continuous anti-German demonstrations in Poland, German political circles are asking whether these demonstrations indicate that Poland wants to terminate the agreement signed in 1934 by the late Polish President Piłsudski and Führer Hitler. The "German Foreign Policy Communications," the mouthpiece of the Foreign Ministry, declared, "Certain events that have occurred in Poland in the past prove that some people in Poland oppose the policy decided in 1934. The reason why German newspapers have never published anything about these events is not because Germany does not pay attention to these events, but because Germany deeply hopes that this temporary surge of extreme patriotism will soon return to the correct path decided by General Piłsudski through common sense, understanding, and realistic policies. Unfortunately, this wish has not yet been realized. If Polish people believe that German interests do not need to be respected, then the evolution of future European developments will make Poland itself regret it. Polish officials should not ignore their geographical situation and abandon their already successful policy." (Haitong News Agency, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a late-night report from Warsaw, Poland is currently taking extraordinary military precautions. In the past four days, it has conscripted 750,000 reservists, which, together with the 300,000 conscripted last week, exceeds 1,000,000 people. In addition, the Polish government has taken steps to convert various industries to a wartime state. (Haitong, 29th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Former leaders of the left-wing opposition party, Krzyk-Baczynski, and of the radical Peasant Party, Witos, who have been in exile in Czechoslovakia for years, suddenly returned to Warsaw yesterday, which has greatly surprised local political figures. Although the three opposition leaders claimed that their return was to serve sentences of several years that had not been carried out, well-informed sources have learned that the sentences are about to be revoked, and the return of the three men must have an important relationship with the Polish internal political situation. (Haitong, 29th)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Regarding the anti-German movement in Poland reported by "German Foreign Policy Communications," people here have a deep understanding of it. Although Polish newspapers have published as much as possible the messages sent by the semi-official German news agency, there is not much commentary. However, the concerns of political figures have also been revealed to some extent. "Polish Express" stated, "Germany intends to control Poland." The opposition party's organ "Narodowiec" stated, "German political figures have focused their attention on Poland, but the impression they have gained is that Poland is in a state of preparation." Polish officials are taking a cautious attitude and commenting on the rumors. "Polish Express," in view of the rumors spread by foreign newspapers about the situation in Poland, protested in its editorial. It is reported that three Jews have been sentenced to two months in prison for spreading rumors. (Haitong, 29th)</p>

<h3>T.V. Soong and Shao Lizi Telegraph Stimson to Criticize Pittman's Proposed New Neutrality Act: "Cash and Carry" Favors Japan in the Far East</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) T.V. Soong and Shao Lizi, Chairman and Vice-Chairman, respectively, of the Chinese Branch of the World Peace Promotion Association, today telegraphed former U.S. Secretary of State Stimson to criticize the inappropriateness of Pittman's proposed new Neutrality Act. The reasons they stated are as follows: First, this neutrality law may be regarded as a national policy in small countries, but in large countries, this neutrality law cannot be used as a national policy. Second, international disputes must distinguish between right and wrong. Therefore, for the sake of international morality, this neutrality law should not be used as a national policy. Third, U.S. legislators must pay attention to the development of the situation in the Pacific. Finally, the "cash and carry" clause only favors countries with navies and large numbers of merchant ships. In the Far East, it only favors Japan. (Associated Press, 26th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Neutrality Law Amendment Question Discussed by the Foreign Relations Committee</h3>
<p>(Washington) Regarding the Neutrality Law Amendment, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to meet tomorrow. At the same time, 17 presidents of Chinese universities and colleges jointly telegraphed the U.S. Congress, urging them to distinguish between aggressors and the aggressed, and asking them not to make provisions for cash transactions, as this move would be beneficial to Japan. However, the U.S. government believes that almost all the assistance that China can obtain at present comes from Burma and the Soviet Union. Therefore, it believes that the implementation of the cash transaction principle will not hinder China. Furthermore, it is generally believed that no matter how the Neutrality Law is amended, President Roosevelt will not apply this new legal system to the Far East more consistently than before. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Isolationist senators from the Republican Party, Nye, and from the Democratic Party, Bone and Clark, yesterday proposed amendments to the Neutrality Law, stipulating that once Congress decides or the President declares that a foreign war already exists, the "cash and carry" clause should apply to all goods, including munitions. ((Associated Press, 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Democratic Congressman Isaac recently submitted two bills to the House of Representatives, proposing to include Cocos Island, which belongs to Costa Rica in Central America, and the Galapagos Islands, which belong to Ecuador in South America, into the U.S. territory in order to strengthen the defenses of the Panama Canal.

<h3>U.S.-Japan Trade Plummets</h3>
<p>(Washington dispatch) According to the announcement of the Department of Commerce, the economic activities of Japan in 1938 have declined. In addition, the tacit boycott of Japanese goods by the American people is quite active. The trade between Japan and the United States has been greatly reduced, falling to the lowest level since 1934. Specifically, the import of Japanese goods into the United States has decreased by 37% compared to 1937, and the export of American goods to Japan has decreased by 30.5% compared to 1937. As for the total amount of U.S.-Japan trade, it accounted for 27.5% of Japan's total foreign trade in 1937, but it decreased to 20.5% in 1938.</p>
<p>These figures are mostly based on reports submitted by the commercial counselors of the U.S. Embassy in Japan. According to this report, the decline in Japan's imports of various major goods into the United States in 1938 compared to the previous year is as follows (calculated by price):</p>
<p>The following are the main U.S. goods imported into Japan:</p>
<p>Also, the characteristics of the Japanese economy last year were the same as the previous year. In short, the abnormal development of the arms industry and the gradual decline of the peace industry are the reasons. According to the investigation by the Ministry of Commerce, the production volume of Japan's heavy industry (including the arms industry) increased by 75% compared to the previous year, while the production volume of the peace industry (including the industry that manufactures export goods) decreased by 30%. The total value of all exported goods was 2,897,000,000 yen, a decrease of 13% compared to the previous year. The total value of all imported goods was 2,836,000,000 yen, a decrease of 28.5%. In addition, although Japan's financial situation was barely sustainable last year, the amount of banknotes issued by the Bank of Japan increased by 20% compared to the previous year. The total amount of the country's debt at the end of last year reached 16,222,700,000 yen, an increase of one-third compared to the previous year.</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Japan Craigie Will Come to Shanghai to Meet with the British Ambassador to Discuss the Issue of Preserving Rights and Interests in China; After the Meeting, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr May Go to Chongqing</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Well-informed sources here believe that the visit of the British Ambassador to Japan, Craigie, to Shanghai to meet with the British Ambassador to China, Sir Archibald Clark Kerr, and Sir Archibald Clark Kerr's subsequent trip to Chongqing, as well as the Soviet Ambassador to China Luganetz's trip to Moscow, are all related to the important future development of the Far East situation. The Japanese army is eager to conclude peace with China, but it does not want to fulfill China's ideals or accept China's conditions, but rather to obtain the cooperation and agreement of the Kuomintang and the National Government to participate in the "suppression" of guerrillas in order to consolidate its position in China. People here believe that this is absolutely impossible. Britain is eager to cope with the European crisis and also wants to preserve its territories in the Far East and its rights and interests in China. Well-informed sources say that the Soviet Union's aid to China also seeks to avoid and eliminate psychological conflicts with other democratic countries. The Soviet Union is willing to fully cooperate with other countries that aid China. According to well-informed foreign sources, the Associated Press reporter was told that when Craigie and Sir Archibald Clark Kerr meet in Shanghai, they may discuss the following points: (1) the defense of the Shanghai International Settlement; (2) the issue of preserving British political and economic rights and interests in China. This point is even more important because the Japanese have recently launched anti-British movements in Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Hankou; (3) the defense of Hong Kong and Kowloon in the event of a sudden Japanese attack if a European war breaks out; (4) to review the Sino-Japanese war and exchange views on Britain's role as a mediator.

<h3>Review of the Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Agreement Dispute: Generally Believed Japan Will Soften</h3>
<p>Soviet-Japanese relations have traditionally been a history of opposition and conflict. In recent years, due to Japan's forcible occupation of the four northeastern provinces of China, border issues have caused frequent disputes. The question of whether a Soviet-Japanese war would break out has been a matter of constant concern to the world. Since the conclusion of the Changkufeng Incident last August, the tense relations between the two countries have temporarily eased. However, recently, due to the issue of revising the fisheries agreement, the relations between the two countries have become strained again, with a palpable sense of imminent conflict.</p>
<p>Origin of the Fisheries Agreement</p>
<p>Before discussing the Soviet-Japanese fisheries agreement dispute, we must first explain the origins of the fisheries agreement issue. The Soviet-Japanese Fisheries Treaty was formally established in 1907, based on Article XI, Paragraph 1 of the Treaty of Portsmouth after the Russo-Japanese War in 1905, which stipulated that "Russia permits Japanese subjects to engage in fishing rights along the coasts of Russian territories bordering the Sea of Japan, the Sea of Okhotsk, and the Bering Sea, and may conclude an agreement with Japan." Because of the signing of this treaty, Russia ceded fishing rights in the above-mentioned territorial waters to Japan, and Japan gradually established its fisheries business in the North Pacific. The acquisition of these fishing rights, as the Japanese said, was "exchanged for blood." At the time, the reason why Imperial Russia ceded fishing rights in the above-mentioned territorial waters to Japan was, of course, the important reason of defeat in the war. At the same time, Russia itself had no fishing operations in the Far East at that time, which was also a factor. The Japanese believed that from then on, North Pacific fishing was a permanent and immutable national right of Japan. In reality, the Russians never ceased to regard this as a humiliation. It was only because Russia was always busy with internal strife and revolution after the Russo-Japanese War that they had no time to attend to these Far Eastern fishing rights. The initially established fisheries agreement was originally set for a term of two years, expiring in 1919. However, at that time, Russia was just after the revolution, and the Soviet government had only recently been established, so there was no time to negotiate a revision with Japan. Therefore, in the absence of a treaty, Japan, protected by warships, fished freely in Soviet Far Eastern territorial waters. It was not until January 1925, when Soviet-Japanese diplomatic relations were restored, that negotiations began on revising the fisheries agreement. After many difficulties and twists, lasting more than two years, the famous "Soviet-Japanese Basic Fisheries Agreement" was established in Beijing in 1928, re-demarcating the fishing grounds leased by Japan. The treaty was valid for eight years, but even after this basic fisheries agreement, which was established after many twists and turns, was implemented, many disputes continued to arise between the two countries. Japan, which has always disregarded international faith and is accustomed to violating international treaties, did not abide by this fisheries agreement. In 1929, due to its failure to participate in the fishing ground bidding, it freely fished regardless of the restrictions in the agreement. At the same time, on the Soviet side, as the turmoil of the domestic revolution gradually subsided, the so-called "Ten-Year Plan for State-Owned Fisheries Construction" was established in 1927, actively carrying out Far Eastern fisheries development. It is undeniable that Japanese private enterprises were at a disadvantage in competition with Soviet state-owned enterprises. Since the initial establishment of the fisheries agreement in 1907, the fishing zones owned by Japan have always maintained an eight-to-two ratio with the Soviet Union. However, by 1929, the Soviet fishing zones had rapidly increased to more than half of Japan's, and by 1936, they had even exceeded the number of Japanese fishing zones. If this trend continued, Japan's fishing zones would soon be completely taken back by the Soviet Union. However, in 1932, Hirota Koki, the Japanese ambassador to the Soviet Union at the time, negotiated with Karakhan and established the so-called "Stable Fishing Zone Agreement," which allowed Japan to obtain most of the fishing zones it leased at the time without bidding. At that time, Japan had a total of 392 fishing zones, of which 282 belonged to the so-called "stable fishing zones" and were not affected by bidding due to the conclusion of the Stable Fishing Zone Agreement. In addition, there were 44 so-called "special contract fishing zones" with attached canning factories. The fisheries issue, which was often the source of disputes, was finally temporarily resolved.</p>
<p>Cause of Dispute</p>
<p>However, time flies, and in 1936, the eight-year term of the fisheries agreement expired. Therefore, the Soviet and Japanese sides, represented by Bzesinski and Shigemitsu, conducted negotiations in Moscow to revise the fisheries treaty. Finally, an agreement was reached, and it was scheduled to be formally signed on November 20. The outline is as follows: (1) The validity period of the fisheries treaty is extended by eight years, (2) Long-term lease of stable fishing zones stipulated by Hirota and Karakhan, (3) Special contract fishing zones are extended by eight years, (4) Maintain the conversion rate of 32.5 sen per ruble, (5) Maintain fishing resources. The reason why this agreement could be reached was entirely due to the Soviet Union's concessions and concern for the overall situation. The extension of the validity period of the fisheries treaty by eight years and the long-term guaranteed lease of stable fishing zones are self-evident. Even the ruble conversion rate, which the Soviet side had requested to increase by five yuan due to the repeated devaluation of the Japanese currency, was not implemented. However, while Japan was negotiating with the Soviet Union on fishing rights leases, it was also negotiating with Germany on the so-called Anti-Comintern Pact, which was aimed at opposing the Soviet Union, and it was scheduled to be concluded five days after the signing of the fisheries revision treaty on November 20, i.e., December 25. Its intention was to sign the anti-Comintern Pact with Germany after the fisheries treaty was signed and the fishing rights were firmly grasped, so that the Soviet Union would have no recourse. However, the plan was not kept secret, and the news of the Japanese-German agreement, the anti-Comintern Pact, was discovered by the Soviet Union before the fisheries treaty was formally signed. As a result, the Soviet Union's attitude suddenly hardened, and it refused to sign, citing that domestic procedures had not yet been completed. It goes without saying that Japan's signing of the Anti-Comintern Pact was hostile to the Soviet Union and regarded the Soviet Union as an enemy. The Soviet Union certainly had no need to cede its rights to an enemy. As a result, the expired fisheries treaty was extended by one year in its entirety, and a temporary agreement was concluded as a temporary solution. A year passed quickly, and in 1937, another temporary agreement was concluded. However, by the end of last year, the Soviet Union had taken an evasive attitude towards the revision of the fisheries treaty, and was unwilling to conclude even a temporary agreement. Moreover, it stated that after all treaties expired, even the stable fishing zones would be included in the bidding. Since the fishing zones are owned by the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union certainly has the right to take them back after the contract expires. However, Japan always used the Treaty of Portsmouth as a basis, believing that North Pacific fishing was already a permanent national right of Japan. On this point, the Soviet People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs has long pointed out that the Treaty of Portsmouth has long been violated by Japan, and Japan's fishing rights can no longer be based on this treaty. This is because the Treaty of Portsmouth stipulates that Japan shall not station troops in "Manchuria," and the guard force along the railway shall not exceed 15 per kilometer. However, after the September 18th Incident, Japan stationed a large army in the four northeastern provinces for a long time. At the same time, in the Treaty of Portsmouth, Japan acknowledged that it would not build fortresses or military structures on Sakhalin and nearby islands, and would not obstruct the freedom of navigation of Soviet ships in the Soya Strait or establish military zones. However, recently, Japan has built military works in these places. In addition, the overdue payment for the Chinese Eastern Railway, amounting to 5,981,625 yen, has long passed, and although the Soviet government has urged it, Japan has not yet fulfilled its guarantee responsibility. The Japanese government itself does not fulfill its obligations to the Soviet Union, but it not only wants the Soviet Union to fulfill its obligations, but also wants the Soviet Union to satisfy Japan's demands beyond these obligations. The Soviet government, of course, cannot tolerate this kind of unreasonable demand from the Japanese government. Therefore, the Soviet side believes that if Japan wants to start negotiations on a new long-term fisheries treaty, it must at least fulfill its obligation to pay for the Chinese Eastern Railway. In order to carry out the payment of the price and to meet the needs of the new fisheries treaty, and to prove Japan's good faith, it is prepared to re-conclude a temporary fisheries treaty with a term of one year under the following basic conditions: (1) All fishing zones whose lease terms have expired, including the former stable fishing zones, will be put up for bidding. (2) Forty fishing zones cannot be leased to Japanese people in the future due to military strategy and fisheries protection. (3) Special contract fishing zones may be extended for one year. From the Soviet Union's point of view, these conditions are already a great concession, but in the eyes of the Japanese, they are still difficult to accept. Therefore, from last year to the present, although Togo and Litvinov have held many negotiations, the result has been unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Future Forecast</p>
<p>If, according to the Soviet Union's conditions, most of the fishing zones are put up for bidding, then it will certainly be extremely difficult for Japanese private enterprises to compete with Soviet state-owned enterprises. As a result, Japan's North Pacific fisheries will inevitably be completely destroyed. According to the production volume of Japanese fishing zones in Soviet territory, although it only accounts for 4% or 6% of Japan's total aquatic product production, the main products, such as canned salmon, tuna, salted fish, and canned crab, are almost entirely exported to the British and American markets, amounting to about 30 million yuan per year. Compared with Japan's total trade volume, this amount is not large, but this international income is very important for adjusting the international balance of payments, unlike commodities that need to be imported as raw materials, processed, and then exported. At the same time, the fishermen are all small farmers from Tohoku, Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and other places in Japan, numbering about 20,000, with a total annual income of more than 4 million yuan, which also helps the poor villages in Tohoku. If the North Pacific Soviet-controlled fisheries are destroyed, it will have a great impact on Japan's economy and society. Therefore, Japan attaches great importance to the fisheries agreement and is very panicked that the fisheries agreement cannot be signed. Instead of seeking a reasonable solution in a proper way, Japan is even taking more vicious means to deal with the Soviet Union, deciding not to participate in the fishing zone bidding on March 15, and preparing to implement free fishing under the protection of warships during the May fishing season. However, today, the Soviet Far Eastern coastline is not as defenseless as it used to be, and it is possible to fish freely. Now, military facilities have long been secretly built on the Soviet Far Eastern territory and territorial waters. If Japan implements free fishing under the protection of warships, the seriousness of the situation can certainly be imagined. It is said that the Soviet Union has built six military bases along the coast, centered on Vladivostok, and has deployed more than 130 submarines. Moreover, recently, the Arctic route from Leningrad to Murmansk, the ice-free port of the Arctic Ocean, to Petropavlovsk and Vladivostok in the Far East has been opened. The distance from European Russia to the Far East has been shortened, and efforts are being made to ensure absolute safety. The opening of the route also shows that the Soviet Union has long been confident in its military preparations. According to a Haidao News Agency Tokyo dispatch on February 8, the Soviet Union has established a military committee in Vladivostok, chaired by the commander of the Far Eastern Fleet. In addition to the Far Eastern Fleet, there are also two army marshals under its command. The committee has also instructed its subordinates to open fire on Japanese fishing boats immediately if they are found in territorial waters. A Reuter dispatch also reported that the Soviet Embassy in Japan originally had 14 staff members, but now, due to the deterioration of relations between the two countries, only Chargé d'Affaires Smirnov and Second Secretary Annalov remain, and Smirnov will also be returning to his country soon. Kalinin has long said: "The Soviet Union is not afraid of Japan and other aggressor countries. If the imperialists are still not aware, the Soviet Union will give them a greater blow than the Changkufeng Incident." The current Soviet-Japanese relations are certainly very serious. However, the Soviet Union's garrison in the Far East is entirely to defend against the provocation of aggressors, and it is not an offensive military preparation. At the same time, Japan's toughness is often just a threatening posture. The reason why Japan dares to make a statement of armed self-fishing this time is really because of the concessions of European democratic countries, which have allowed Western aggressors to develop step by step. Therefore, Japan is also pretending to be strong. On the one hand, it wants to use the fisheries issue to make a gesture of attacking the Soviet Union in order to win the favor of Germany and Italy. At the same time, it has landed on Hainan Island to contain Britain and France with the tense situation in the Far East in order to strengthen the momentum of Germany and Italy's colonial demands. However, Japan is already exhausted in its war against China. The world has long known that it is fierce in appearance but faint of heart, and it has no strength to fight against a third country. The Soviet Union also has no intention of challenging Japan, but it is also by no means something that Japan can threaten. Therefore, we believe that Japan will eventually soften like the Changkufeng Incident and seek a temporary solution through compromise. As a result, it is likely that the aggressor in the East will lose face once again in front of the world.</p>

<h3>Japanese Aircraft Intrusion Causes 20 Million in Losses, Guangxi Province Completes Air Defense Network, General Trade Office Moves from Wuzhou to Longzhou</h3>
<p>Guilin Correspondence. Since the establishment of the Southwest Headquarters in Guilin, the national defense of Guangxi has been strengthened, and the various defense lines are becoming more consolidated. In terms of proactive measures, there has been significant progress in increasing and organizing mechanized units, replenishing and reorganizing the regular army, and arming and training local militias in various districts. In terms of reactive measures, the implementation of clearing the fields, the construction of air defense trenches, and the replenishment of air defense posts and lookout towers are more complete and thorough than before. Other political, economic, and educational departments are all based on the premise of long-term resistance, striving for simplification and militarization, so that the entire Guangxi's facilities are developed in the course of military progress. The following is a miscellaneous account of the various situations.</p>
<p>Consolidate Air Defense</p>
<p>The Japanese troops invading South China have been holding onto their original strongholds in the East, West, and North Rivers for several months and have not made any major westward incursions. With regard to Guangxi Province, they have only used aircraft to bomb, so the prosperous towns and cities of Guangxi Province have all been subjected to Japanese aircraft intrusions. In order to strengthen the air defenses of the entire province, Director Bai Chongxi planned to complete the air defense network in various districts during the recent Southwest Military Conference. After this plan was decided, it was submitted to the Central Supreme Military Headquarters, which allocated a special air defense fund to actively increase air defense troops. Priority was given to Wuzhou, Guilin, Liuzhou, Nanning, and Yulin in key areas. In addition to reorganizing the original air defense teams in these five places, several air defense teams were added to each place, and the latest high-altitude artillery, high-altitude machine guns, and various air defense weapons were added. The quantity depends on the needs of the local situation. The second priority is Qinyuan, Xunzhou, Longzhou, and Baise. The third priority is the cities along the Fu and Da Rivers. Those who are not in key areas will focus on various passive air defense facilities in addition to setting up appropriate air defense troops. All of these are to be completed before March 30. The air defense headquarters in various districts received an order from the Southwest Headquarters yesterday, and from today onwards, they will separately conduct the registration of air defense personnel, which is also to be completed before March 30, for recruitment purposes.</p>
<p>Control Exports</p>
<p>After the war of resistance, Guangxi's products, such as tin, tungsten, manganese, antimony, tung oil, tea oil, anise oil, sandpaper, camphor, and camphor wood, were all subject to government control for transportation and export. After the fall of Guangzhou, the waterways of the West River were blocked, and there was no fixed route for the transportation and export of goods. The provincial government then divided the areas of the goods that were previously subject to export control and set new restrictions. Recently, due to the blockage of the West River, the General Trade Office for the import and export of controlled goods has moved from Wuzhou to Longzhou, and most of the major export goods for foreign trade are also exported from Longzhou Zhennanguan. The trade office in Wuzhou only retains a small number of staff to handle matters, because the volume of goods exported from Wuzhou has decreased significantly. Now, in order to change the method and facilitate the transportation of goods, the General Trade Office stipulates that merchants who transport controlled products for export are allowed to determine their own transportation routes and report them to the Trade Office for approval. After the transportation permits are issued, they are allowed to transport and export freely according to their routes to facilitate transportation, but only in places where taxation bureaus and checkpoints have been established to prevent smuggling.</p>
<p>Air Raid Losses</p>
<p>Guilin was originally the political center of Guangxi, and after the establishment of the Southwest Headquarters, it became the military center. However, Japanese aircraft often flew to Guilin to intrude. From the first Japanese aircraft intrusion on October 16, 1937, to January 12 of this year, there have been a total of 36 times, with 662 bombs and 160 incendiary bombs dropped. A total of 325 houses were directly destroyed, 1,080 houses were partially destroyed, 145 men and women were killed, 166 were injured, 3,154 households were affected, 14,842 people were affected, and the total value of lost property was approximately 20 million yuan. The government distributed relief funds to the victims, totaling 125,787.70 Guangxi currency.</p>
<p>Rising Rice Prices</p>
<p>Guangxi Province is a rice-producing area. In normal years, it can be self-sufficient. Last year, the various districts had generally good harvests, and because transportation was blocked, rice prices fell sharply. A month ago, rice prices were still stable. Unexpectedly, after entering March, rice prices in various districts rose sharply. Rice in Xun, Wu, and Yu districts was sold for 24 to 28 yuan per 100 catties in Guangxi currency, 34 to 35 yuan per 100 catties in Guilin district, 25 to 26 yuan per 100 catties in Liuzhou district, and more than 30 yuan per 100 catties in Qinyuan district. The reason for the sudden increase in price is that the old and new crops are not connected, the population has increased, there are more people entering than leaving, and rice merchants are taking the opportunity to hoard and profit.</p>
<h3>Details of the Assassination of Zeng Zhongming: The Residences of Wang and Zeng Were Separated by Only One Wall</h3>
<p>Hanoi dispatch. Zeng Zhongming, secretary to Wang Jingwei, was assassinated in his residence in Hanoi. The circumstances are as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Residence</p>
<p>Zeng followed Wang to Hanoi and resided there for several months. He initially lived with Wang at the Kyoto Grand Hotel, and later moved to a Western-style building at a certain number on Kolong Street. He had been living there for more than a month. Recently, Wang told a friend that he wanted to travel to Europe, and Zeng was also preparing to go with him. Unexpectedly, this tragedy occurred at this time. The three-story building on Kolong Street originally belonged to Guo Huangbiao, a Fujianese. There is an iron fence around the front of the house, and there is a small garden inside the fence. There are two houses in the garden that are connected to each other. They are three stories high and the architecture is quite beautiful. The basement of the house is the workers' residence, the second floor is the reception hall and dining room, etc., and the third floor is the living room. The layout of the two houses is similar. Wang lives in one room, and the other room is occupied by Zeng's wife and family. Zeng's daughter recently came from Chongqing and also lives there. The tragedy occurred on the third floor of Zeng's residence.</p>
<p>Circumstances of the Assassination</p>
<p>At around 2:30 a.m. on the 21st of this month, five or six young men climbed over the iron fence outside the house, sneaked into the garden, and went straight to the third floor where Zeng lived. They opened the door to Zeng's bedroom and fired twenty or thirty shots at the bed where Zeng and his wife were sleeping. A total of five people were injured in the assassination. Zeng Zhongming was hit by four bullets in the chest and legs and was seriously injured. Zeng's wife, Fang Junbi, was grazed by a bullet on the abdomen and hit in the leg. Three other people were slightly injured while trying to rescue them. One was Cai Rancheng, one was He Jing, and one was unknown. Neighbors were awakened by the gunshots at the time, but thought it was firecrackers and ignored them. After the incident, his family immediately notified the Central Police Station on Luoshan Street, which immediately sent a large number of detectives to search for the assassins in all directions and arrested four suspects on the spot and took them back to the station for interrogation.</p>
<p>Ineffective Treatment</p>
<p>When the gunshots rang out upstairs, the workers downstairs all hid and dared not move. After the assassins left, they dared to go upstairs. Zeng was the most seriously injured and was already dying at the time. The neighbors were immediately asked to invite a doctor named Feng to the scene for treatment, but injections to relieve the pain were ineffective. Zeng and his wife were then taken to the Army Medical Hospital for treatment by car. The diagnosis revealed that Zeng was hit in a vital part and could not be saved. He died in the hospital at 4:30 p.m. that day. His wife's injuries were not serious. After the incident, the detectives inspected the entire house and found two small Gaul-style six-shot pistols. The four arrested murderers were immediately subjected to preliminary interrogation at the police station on the 22nd. According to their confession, this act was purely a patriotic action. The original purpose was to assassinate Wang Jingwei, but they entered the wrong room and mistakenly assassinated Zeng. Wang lived only one wall away, and the appearance was indeed one house.</p>
<h3>After Two Days and Nights of Bloody Battles, Chinese Troops Recapture Daqiao</h3>
<p>Songs of Patriotism Never Cease in the Border Areas Along the Yangtze River</p>
<p>Jiangdu Correspondence. As the Japanese attempt to seize northern Jiangsu and the battles along the Grand Canal are raging, the reporter, in order to understand the real situation of the anti-Japanese war of the guerrillas in the border areas along the Yangtze River in northern Jiangsu, went to Daqiao, Kouan, Gaoqiao, and other key towns to</p>
<p>Conduct on-the-Spot Inspections</p>
<p>Due to their location on the river, these places have been repeatedly ravaged by the Japanese, and the local vitality has been greatly damaged. However, since the recovery by the guerrilla commander Fang Jun, the situation has gradually improved. Although the residents are often threatened by the artillery fire of Japanese warships, they are able to work hard and are highly motivated to resist Japan. The reporter visited Commander Fang Jun. Fang is young and handsome, newly appointed as a lieutenant general of the Army by the Military Affairs Commission and concurrently the commander of the guerrilla area along the Yangtze River. However, he is humble and wears simple military uniform. After shaking hands with the reporter, he told me in detail about the recent battles with the Japanese army. According to him, the</p>
<p>Operational Area He is Responsible For</p>
<p>The operational area is more than a dozen towns and villages along the Yangtze River, such as Yangzhoukou. The location is important. The Japanese army has repeatedly attempted to invade the north, but the reason for their hesitation is that they are afraid of our containment. Since my deployment here, I have engaged in skirmishes with the Japanese army about 40 times. Because the Japanese army suffered casualties from time to time, they have been increasingly eager to attack us. A few days ago, after receiving a secret report from a traitor, they found out the location of my headquarters and launched a large-scale attack, led by a certain Japanese captain with more than 700 people, carrying field heavy weapons, in three routes</p>
<p>Pounce on Daqiao</p>
<p>At that time, I only had more than 100 people around me. Caught off guard, we could only resist bravely. After two hours of fierce fighting, we were outnumbered and retreated while fighting. The troops scattered and lay in ambush in the trenches. The Japanese attempted to wipe us out in one fell swoop and recklessly bombarded us with a large amount of ammunition, but they were all aimless. The shelling stopped slightly in the evening. Taking advantage of their slight slack, we counterattacked. The next morning, our reinforcements arrived, and we</p>
<p>Launched a Joint Counterattack</p>
<p>The Japanese army was unable to hold out and retreated in a miserable state. Daqiao was declared recaptured. In this battle, I and my subordinates did not sleep for two nights and only had one meal. However, only two people were killed in action and five were slightly injured. The Japanese abandoned more than 100 bodies and countless ammunition was consumed. Speaking of the victory of the war of resistance, he expressed great optimism. He then recounted the organization of local people and the cultivation of people's strength. He paid particular attention to education. There are more than 30 primary schools in the area, and the sound of reading never stops. However, funding is difficult and he is currently trying to raise funds.</p>
<h3>The Lin Baisheng Shooting Case: Chen Xilin Sentenced to Fifteen Years; Doctor Says Lin’s Right Eye Likely Irrecoverable</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Correspondence: Lin Baisheng was shot and injured in Des Voeux Road some time ago, and the perpetrator, Chen Xilin, was apprehended at the scene. After Mr. Lin recovered from his injuries and was discharged from the hospital last month, the Hong Kong Magistracy brought the case to trial. The presiding judge, after a very thorough investigation into the serious case, reopened the criminal court on the 18th to try the defendant. Because the defendant, Chen Xilin, continued to vehemently deny using an iron ruler to attack Lin Baisheng, the trial was postponed to the afternoon of the 22nd, when the jury and the plaintiff's witnesses were summoned again. This was the third</p>
<p>Public Trial</p>
<p>At the time, the defendant continued to vehemently deny the crime, while the plaintiff, Lin Baisheng, accompanied by his defense lawyer, Silva, personally attended the court. Lin was wearing a blue silk cotton robe and holding a cane. However, his right eye injury had not healed and was covered with an eye patch. After the court session began, the judge charged the defendant, Chen Xilin, with the following two counts: (1) On January 1st of this year, he injured Lin Baisheng in Des Voeux Road Central with intent to murder; (2) At the above-mentioned location, he injured Lin Baisheng with intent to cripple his limbs. The Hong Kong government was also represented by two government lawyers, who first stated to the judge Lin Baisheng’s</p>
<p>Shooting Incident</p>
<p>Then, Robertson, the manager of the wine department of the Pacific Trading Company, testified that at 5 p.m. that day, he left his office after completing his work and personally witnessed the defendant striking Mr. Lin three times with an iron hammer, with great force. Seeing this, Robertson shouted for him to stop. The defendant, upon hearing the voice, abandoned the hammer and fled. Robertson then gave chase. At that time, the defendant ran southwest, and when he reached the alley near Lane Crawford, he seemed hesitant and indecisive. At that moment, a member of the military medical team came face to face and apprehended the defendant, taking him back to the scene of the incident, and when the</p>
<p>Police Arrived</p>
<p>handed the defendant over to the police. Following this, a doctor from the Maryknoll Hospital testified, stating the same as before. Then, a police detective said that when the defendant was brought to the police station, he had asked him, "Who is the injured person?" The defendant replied, "Lin Baisheng." He then asked why he had attacked Lin, and the defendant said, "I don't want to talk about it." Thereupon, the judge stated that based on Lin's injuries and the testimony of the witnesses, it was clear that the defendant's attack on Lin was intentional. Therefore, regardless of whether this attack was intended to silence him or was purely a personal vendetta, his actions clearly indicated an intent to murder. After the judge finished speaking, a doctor from Maryknoll Hospital took the stand and testified that</p>
<p>Lin's Right Eye</p>
<p>would be permanently affected by the injury. Then the plaintiff, Lin Baisheng, testified about the circumstances at the time. After the testimony, the defendant, Chen Xilin, argued, "At 4:30 p.m. that afternoon, after finishing work at the Murray Barracks, I was walking west towards Chung Tin Building when I heard a lot of noise and saw a crowd of people gathered, watching. I thought some accident had occurred, so I went to take a look. At that time, there were even more onlookers, and I could not see who was injured. Then I walked towards Lane Crawford, and suddenly I was grabbed by a Westerner, who took me to the scene of the incident. I really don't know why I was arrested." According to the testimony of Lin Jiu, a witness for the defendant, "I live on the fourth floor of 29 Shandong Street and work with the defendant at the Murray Barracks. He left work at 4:30 p.m., while I finished work after 5 p.m." Thereupon, the judge</p>
<p>Analyzed the Case</p>
<p>The jurors retired to deliberate for about ten minutes and ultimately decided by a vote of six to one that the defendant, Chen Xilin, was guilty. The judge then said to Chen Xilin in court, "The jury has found you guilty of the first charge. But you are still lucky. If Lin Baisheng had not had his felt hat to defend against the attack, he would not have survived. At that time, you would have been guilty of murder." Having said this, the judge sentenced Chen Xilin to fifteen years in prison. The shooting case thus came to an end.</p>
<h3>The New Fourth Army in the Past Year: War of Resistance Experience and Lessons (3)</h3>
<p>— Xiang Ying</p>
<p>(3) The enemy's advance into Wuhan mainly relied on the coordination of the navy, air force, and army, not entirely on the army. Instead, it relied on the navy to cover the army's advance into Wuhan. Therefore, the Yangtze River line was its transportation line for advancement. In order to facilitate supplying the front and transporting troops, the Japanese invaders had to remove the threat to the Yangtze River's transportation, which necessitated a counter-offensive. This means that in the second phase, due to our attacks, the enemy launched a counter-offensive. There are two reasons for this.</p>
<p>However, the enemy's counter-offensive was a defensive one, using the counter-offensive to achieve its defensive goals, attempting to drive away all our troops on the Jinghu Line, the Jinghang Line, and around Nanjing to ensure their safety. Therefore, the offensives were not large-scale. The offensives on the front lines, such as the offensive in southern Anhui, were also a type of defensive offensive, the main purpose of which was to maintain Yangtze River transportation. Because transportation on the Yangtze River relied on ships, we had previously organized many mobile ship detachments, disrupting their transportation and forcing them to deploy troops in Jiangnan to maintain their transportation. From an overall perspective, the enemy's counter-offensive was still a defensive offensive, and we must clearly distinguish this point.</p>
<p>How do we perceive the enemy's offensive? From the overall situation of the Jiangnan War, the enemy currently has three offensive centers: one centered on Qingyang in southern Anhui, and two in Jiangnan, one centered on Maoshan, and one centered on Xiaodanyang between Nanjing and Danyang. These three centers can also be said to be our army's operational strongholds and the base points for cooperation with allied forces.</p>
<p>In southern Anhui, the enemy successively occupied Guichi, Tongling, and Fanchang from September to December, and recently attacked Qingyang. In Jiangnan, the enemy launched a five-pronged attack on Baoyan on September 10th, a three-pronged attack on Jiangye Bridge on September 12th, and a two-pronged attack on September 15th, one on Shangxingbu and one on Shangpei, Lishui. On October 7th, they launched another two-pronged attack, one on Xinwangzhuang and one on Beizhen, setting fire to Maoshan. On October 24th, they launched a five-pronged attack on the area north of Jurong. On November 10th, the enemy attacked Jiangye Bridge again, and on November 30th, a five-pronged attack was launched on Yanling. Since September, the enemy has constantly attacked our base points. At the end of September, the enemy launched a four-pronged attack on Xiaodanyang after October 12th, and on November 13th, they attacked Huoli, and most recently, on December 21st, they attacked Zhumen. On October 17th, the enemy launched a two-pronged attack on Hongxi Town, and on November 30th, they launched a three-pronged attack on the Qingyi River area and other places with great force. With Qingyang as the center in southern Anhui, and Maoshan and Xiaodanyang as the centers in Jiangnan, the enemy's offensive was mainly aimed at preventing us from establishing a foothold here, forcing us to leave this area, because these three places are all our strategic strongholds, which would allow them to eliminate threats and ensure transportation safety.</p>
<p>In summary, the battles in Jiangnan from June 18th to December 31st can be divided into two stages: the first stage was our offensive period, and the second stage was when the enemy had to adopt a defensive offensive due to our army's attacks, leading to the formation of the enemy's counter-offensive.</p>
<p>Second, how many battles did we fight since the start of the Jiangnan campaign? In summary, during this period of six and a half to seven months, we engaged in a total of 234 battles in Jiangbei and Jiangnan. Among these 234 battles, 200 battles were fought in Jiangnan, which indicates that our battles were mainly fought in Jiangnan.</p>
<p>Third, what did we gain from our battles? I would like to present it in a table. In 234 battles, we captured 1,539 rifles and carbines, 32 light machine guns, 4 heavy machine guns, 48 Mauser pistols, and 20 handguns. We also captured approximately 22,738 Japanese yen, documents, coats, flags, and other military supplies in countless amounts. (Statistical table omitted) In addition to these captured items in the battles, we also destroyed 195 enemy vehicles and 95 bridges. There is a separate statistic for damage to highways and railways. (Statistical table omitted) What was the ratio of casualties between the enemy and us during this period of six and a half to seven months? During this period, our army suffered a total of 664 casualties, while the enemy suffered 3,232 casualties. Observing the enemy-to-us comparison, the ratio is one to four and seven tenths, which can also be said that one of us is equivalent to four and a half of them, which is the most cost-effective in the war of resistance. In the past, for our army's war of resistance, the ratio of enemy-to-us casualties in the battlefield was three or five of us to one enemy. In the second and third phases, it was reduced to a ratio of two and a half to one. Guerrilla warfare is exactly the opposite. For every one of us who dies or is wounded, the enemy has to die or be wounded by four and a half. Accumulating small victories becomes a large number. From these six and a half to seven months of experience, we can fully see that guerrilla warfare is beneficial to us in China's war of resistance. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Cotton Flower: A Sudden Increase in Tianjin Sales of Coarse Yarn; 20-Count Yarn Price Increases by Four to Five Yuan; Japanese Yarn Continues to Advance, Sentiment is Optimistic</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had fallen for five consecutive days, saw a sudden rebound yesterday, which was expected. After falling below 20 yuan, a rebound was inevitable. Recently, the Tianjin merchants in the north have been buying 10-count coarse yarn very strongly. The market is short of this cotton yarn, and the factories are not producing much, so the price not only did not fall but advanced. The 16-count yarn also saw the same situation. As a result, the 20-count yarn was pulled up as well. The market continued to be tight in the afternoon, but actual sales remained weak, with only coarse yarn sales being brisk.</p>
<p>As for the current yarn situation, the market opened in the morning with steady sentiment because it had fallen for many consecutive days and many speculators had liquidated their positions. Seeing the calm situation, some traders started buying, with prices similar to the previous day. The price of 20-count "Bianma" yarn was 367 yuan. However, Tianjin merchants were constantly buying 10-count coarse yarn, and the price was rising steadily, affecting the 20-count yarn as well. The market trend suddenly became tight, and buying momentum rose sharply. The market price rose steadily, and the closing price was 371 yuan. Spot prices also reached 371 yuan. The market was even tighter in the afternoon, rising another yuan, but sales to Tianjin merchants were not weak. However, there were still few transactions for 20-count yarn. Statistics show that the various merchants bought a total of 2,165 bales. The price of 20-count "Shuangma" yarn increased by 5.5 yuan compared to the previous day. "Tiannu" also increased by 4.5 yuan, and "Muyang" increased by 5 yuan. The 32-count and 42-count yarn did not see much trading because transportation on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway was disrupted, and there was a lack of outbound routes. The factories have not been heard of taking any action. The amount of yarn bought by each merchant is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Traders: 1,050 Tianjin: 445 Yunnan: 245</p>
<p>Xiamen:</p>
<p>15 Hong Kong: 80 Mainland: 215</p>
<p>Fujian: 5 Quanzhou: 10</p>
<p>Total: 2,165</p>
<p>The market for Japanese yarn is trending upward because there is talk of sales channels, but in reality, sentiment is optimistic and people are buying goods for the next month, mostly spot goods, and there are not many actual sales. The spot price of 20-count "Shuiyue" yarn is 343-344 yuan, and the spot price of 20-count "Lanfeng" yarn is 332-333 yuan, an increase of 1.2 yuan compared to the previous day.</p>
<h3>U.S. President's Speech Still Plans to Provide Cotton Export Subsidies; American Cotton Sales in Shanghai Become Brisk, Price Drops Another 20 Cents; Indian Cotton is Dark, Dry, and Wastes Too Much in Spinning</h3>
<p>The overseas cotton market is very quiet. The New York cotton market fell at the beginning of the morning due to a weak Liverpool cable, followed by overseas cotton sales. All the traders are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Washington has been discussing the problem of cotton overproduction and the disposal of loan cotton with cotton industry leaders from various regions for over a month. The reason is that this issue is too serious to easily come up with a good solution in a short time. In fact, unless the government releases loan cotton, rewards cotton exports, and provides export subsidies to compensate cotton merchants for their losses, there is no other way. Yesterday, U.S. President Roosevelt gave a speech saying that he also planned to allocate cotton export subsidies, but the amount and value of the subsidies will not be announced for the time being. Yesterday, New York fell two or three points. India was unchanged yesterday, and Egypt fell twenty points. The exchange rate was stable yesterday, and the cotton price converted to legal tender all fell. The price of American cotton and Brazilian cotton fell by 30 cents per picul, India was unchanged, and Egyptian cotton fell by more than one yuan.</p>
<p>The Shanghai foreign cotton market transaction is still quiet as usual, and the factories are all taking a wait-and-see attitude towards the overseas cotton market. The general opinion is that American cotton will fall. Yesterday, all the factories did not have any transactions. Only Shenxin Factory, in order to respond to a newly opened Indian trading company, ordered 1,000 pieces of Indian cotton "Omerla" that can spin 16-count yarn, with a factory price of 69 yuan. The market price of foreign cotton yesterday is recorded below:</p>
<p>The local cotton business is still flat, but more than the previous day. The Yong'an factory is purchasing raw materials for coarse yarn more smoothly, so the price is not loose, the same as the previous day. However, the source of Tongzhou cotton from northern Jiangsu has been smooth recently, but the factories are still slow to purchase because yarn sales are not smooth, and the price is slightly soft, falling by another 20 cents compared to the previous day. However, the inventory is not large. The factories that ordered Indian cotton have felt the pain of being unsuitable. According to a source, after Yao Yi arrived in Shanghai, two more ships were blocked. They are currently negotiating with the future. Whether they will be released is still a question. 1,539 bales of Tongzhou fine velvet cotton arrived at the dock, and 5,600 bales of Zhejiang cotton also arrived. The current cotton sales situation is recorded on the left:</p>
<p>Also, according to recent news, the Indian cotton that Chinese factories ordered from overseas has been continuously arriving in Shanghai for factory use. According to the results of the factory tests, because its color is dark yellow and feels unusually dry, and the seed and waste loss is too much, the cost is too high. The spinning work is even more difficult, and the finished product is inferior and hinders sales. Therefore, it is necessary to purchase Chinese cotton to mix with it so that the color of the manufactured yarn can be bright enough to meet the needs of the society.</p>
<h3>Industry and Commerce Discuss Assisting Cloth Factories with Raw Material Problems</h3>
<p>— Long Ju Sheng</p>
<p>It is heartbreaking to say that the new and old small cloth factories in the Shanghai Special Zone are showing a special, abnormal prosperity. However, this abnormal prosperity contains a sugar coating with poison. The source of their raw materials is unknown. To put it bluntly, most of them are Japanese goods!</p>
<p>We know that the value of Chinese yarn and Japanese yarn differs greatly. Taking 20-count yarn as an example, Chinese yarn costs about 400 yuan per piece, while Japanese yarn only costs 360-370 yuan. Calculating 420 pounds per piece of yarn, each pound differs by about 10 cents in national currency. Some fine yarns may even differ by 20 cents per pound. Choosing the cheap over the expensive is a shortcut to reducing the cost of cloth and increasing profits! For example, to weave a piece of 12-pound fine plain cloth, removing one pound of sizing, about 11 pounds of pure yarn is needed. Combining the warp and weft yarn, if Chinese yarn is used, the yarn cost is more than 10 yuan, plus an opening fee of 80-90 cents per piece, the total cost is about 12 yuan per piece. The market price is 12.70-13.20 yuan, and the profit seems very small. If Japanese yarn is used as the raw material, then each piece of yarn only costs 8-9 yuan, or even less than 8-9 yuan. Adding the opening fee, the total cost is only about 10 yuan, and you can earn 2-3 yuan per piece. If the market is good, you may even have a profit of 4-5 yuan per piece! An ordinary small cloth factory (with about 200 looms) produces 300 pieces per day and night (taking 12-pound fine plain cloth as an example), and can earn a net profit of about 1,000 yuan a day! Calculated for a year, it will earn 300,000-400,000 yuan, which is alarming!</p>
<p>These 300,000-400,000 yuan is only for one factory. Combining all the cloth factories in the special zone, how much more than several million yuan will they earn in a year? However, they indirectly provide people to make bullets, and I don't know how many tens of thousands of them!</p>
<p>It is more reliable to rely on the woven fabric factories attached to the Chinese yarn factories in the special zone. The goods they produce are cheaper because the factory produces yarn, which can save labor costs for reeling and packaging, as well as the cost of materials (such as wrapping paper and bamboo). Transportation is also convenient, so the cost per piece is naturally extremely low, and they can compete with foreign goods. Unfortunately, the output is limited and cannot solve the problem. On the one hand, I dare to faithfully advise the Chinese yarn factories in the special zone that the value of raw materials you sell to the Chinese small cloth factories may as well be lowered more to avoid being a helper for the enemy. For the sake of the future of the entire national industry, it is an unshirkable responsibility. Although merchants value profit, everyone should also turn to patriotic ideas!</p>
<h3>Shuangma Yarn Fell 17.5 Yuan Last Week</h3>
<p>The yarn market last week, from the 19th to the 25th, saw a sudden drop. The reason is that spring sales were disappointing, the situation was weak, the factories opened a lot, the situation in eastern Zhejiang suddenly became tense, the Japanese army continued to harass, and people's hearts became more uneasy. As for the hoarders, seeing the bad environment, they dumped the yarn they had absorbed, and the financial sector also tried to unload it. As a result, various factors came together, and the chips in the market suddenly became loose and flooded, and the market price fell sharply. As a result, the price of 20-count "Bianma" yarn fell by 17.5 yuan compared to the previous week. The factories opened 2,200 bales of fine yarn and 1,500 bales of coarse yarn.</p>
<p>Yarn sales in South China are still barely maintained with sporadic transactions, but sales in eastern Zhejiang, Hunan, and Jiangxi have decreased due to military influences, and it is even more difficult to improve because the Yongbo exchange rate has suddenly increased. Therefore, 32-count yarn fell back 20 yuan, and 42-count yarn fell 10 yuan. The Tianjin merchants in the north are specifically fighting to collect coarse yarn, which is quite smooth, but there is no need for fine yarn at all. Merchants in the mainland are also buying coarse yarn strongly. Generally speaking, it is currently still softening. However, raw cotton is difficult to loosen, and the future is not optimistic. The goods that ordinary speculators have transferred and hoarded in the past are too much, and it is not easy to liquidate completely for a while. In short, things will turn around when they reach their extreme. A weekly statistic of spot yarn is recorded below:</p>
<p>Total transaction volume for the week: 8,681</p>
<h3>Finance: Foreign Exchange Supply and Demand Are Still Equally Matched</h3>
<p>The exchange market yesterday saw more settlement requests from major foreign firms than before. However, foreign banks such as HSBC continued to maintain the market and the Hong Kong cable also continued to sell. As a result, there was no significant fluctuation. The transaction volume in the half day was quite strong. Although foreign banks were selling Hong Kong exchange, the money changers' selling intention was still good, so the situation was still quite stable.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the morning, the London exchange rate for both near and far terms were flat, the New York silver price remained stable, and the London gold price did not rise or fall. The exchange rate of the British pound against the US dollar and the French franc did not change. The exchange rate against Shanghai was slightly lower at 375 (transactions only between the banks). The US dollar against the British pound was down 0.0625, against the French franc was down 0.0625, and against Shanghai remained flat. The Central Bank was closed due to the commemoration of revolutionary martyrs and did not post any prices. The opening selling prices of banks in the morning were 8 and 25 pence for the British pound and 16.09375 yuan for the US dollar, both unchanged from the previous closing. After the opening, foreign firms were settling their accounts heavily, but the Hong Kong cable also sold strongly, and HSBC was also willing to supply, so the situation was quite stable. Foreign firms settled Hong Kong and HSBC British exchange at 8 and 25 pence. When HSBC's posted price was announced, it did not change. Later, foreign firms bought US exchange at 16.0625 yuan from Banque Belge pour l'Etranger. Then, the American bank sold US exchange at 16.09375 yuan to foreign banks. The situation was stable because supply and demand were corresponding, and there was no change. Near noon, foreign firm Andes bought Hong Kong exchange at 55.375 yuan from money changers. The situation was also flat. When the banks' selling prices at noon closing, the British exchange was 8 and 25 pence, and the US exchange was 16.09375 yuan. As a result, the British pound and the US dollar, both currencies saw neither increase nor decrease from previous closing. The Hong Kong exchange also saw no differentiation. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday. The trading recorded for the half day is recorded below:</p>
<p>(British Exchange) Calculated by National Currency One Yuan</p>
<p>Foreign Firms: 8 Pence 25 Hong Kong Cable and HSBC</p>
<p>(US Exchange) Calculated by National Currency One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Foreign Firms: 16.0625 Banque Belge pour l'Etranger</p>
<p>Foreign Banks: 16.09375 American Bank</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Exchange) Calculated by National Currency One Hundred Yuan</p>
<p>Andes: 55.375 Money Changers</p>
<p>No Market on Wednesday Afternoon</p>
<h3>Gold Price Remains Stable with Only One Yuan Difference for the Whole Day</h3>
<p>The spot dark market situation for gold yesterday became even more insignificant. The transactions were also more mediocre and colorless. The price continued to be slightly weak because retail sales were more active. However, there was little change in the middle, remaining stable between 2,077 yuan and 76 yuan from beginning to end. As a result, it continued to fall by two yuan. 150 taels were traded in the morning. The market was closed in the afternoon due to the commemoration of Huanghuagang. The gold price for jewelry stores remained stable, and the British gold remained semi-fixed.</p>
<p>The spot market was closed in the afternoon</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the morning, due to no supply and demand, transactions had not occurred for a long time until 10:35, when money changers bought 50 taels for the jewelry stores at 2,077 yuan, which was the opening price, 2 yuan lower than the trading price on the previous day. After a while, gold firms sold 50 taels to jewelry stores at 76 yuan. Later, at 11:55, money changers did 50 taels of transactions at 77 yuan, which was the noon closing price. In the afternoon, due to the commemoration of the Huanghuagang martyrs and the fact that it was Wednesday, the foreign exchange market was closed. In addition, it was also in a situation where both supply and demand were weak. Therefore, after discussions with colleagues, it was decided to close for half a day. According to the noon closing price of 2,077 yuan, the closing price was 2 yuan lower than the previous closing price. The selling price of cash gold at the gold firms was 2,085 yuan, and the buying price was 2,070 yuan. The current gold price was about 50 yuan lower than the posted gold price, and there were no transactions.</p>
<p>Jewelry Gold Prices Remain Stable</p>
<p>The exchange price for jewelry gold per tael remained stable because the spot price fluctuation was becoming narrower. The price for major gold stores remained at 211 yuan, and the price for small gold stores was 209 yuan. The buying price was 203 yuan.</p>
<p>British Pure Gold Did Not Rise</p>
<p>According to a London cable on the 28th, the price of British pure gold per ounce was unchanged, remaining at 7 pounds, 8 shillings, 5.5 pence. However, the prices of the various banks of the Central Bank were closed because of the Huanghuagang Revolution commemoration.</p>
<h3>Indian Silver Rose Slightly, Main Bar Remained Flat</h3>
<p>According to a London cable on the 28th, the silver market was stable and flat, with little change. Transactions were also weak. After the closing, it was flat and stable. The near and far terms of the main bar silver were unchanged. According to a New York silver cable, the American spot silver remained stable. According to a Bombay silver cable, the Indian silver market was stable. The spot and near terms returned to grow by one anna, and the far term was unchanged.</p>
<h3>British and American Gold Notes: Foreign Banks Are Also Actively Absorbing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of British gold remained unchanged, and the exchange rate of the British pound against the US dollar decreased by 0.025. The local foreign exchange market saw strong settlement of accounts by foreign firms. Foreign banks and Hong Kong cable provided a steady supply. Supply and demand were evenly matched, and the market price was stable. The spot market opened weakly. Retail absorption was rare, and gold firms and money changers had little intention to sell. The market was extremely stable. In the afternoon, it softened slightly. There were few people on the market in the afternoon. Transactions were not made. The trend was hovering and weak. The large firms were quietly waiting for the opportunity, and business was increasingly bleak. Foreign currency, British and American gold pounds, were rarely needed. Due to the approaching end of the month, the settlement of accounts was booming. British and American gold notes are in great demand, and foreign banks are also actively absorbing them, so they have increased slightly. Association transactions were still rare. Only Xiang Kang released American gold notes worth 500 yuan for Lee Tung to absorb, and Wing Fung released Hong Kong notes worth 500 yuan for Hung Cheong to absorb. Yesterday's market price: British gold notes rose by 2 cents, American gold pounds fell by 1 dime, American gold notes rose by 0.05 percent, Hong Kong notes rose by 0.02 percent, French franc notes rose by 0.25 yuan, Singapore notes rose by 1 cent, and other currencies were unchanged.</p>

<h3>Securities: Crisps Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>British Far East Stocks Decline</p>
<p>Shanghai Foreign Stocks See Some Purchases</p>
<p>The London trading prices for Chinese foreign currency bonds on the 28th of this month (Tuesday) showed a steady trend, with only the Crisps bond continuing to rise by half a pound, to a price of 39.5 pounds. The Daqing Railway bond fell by one pound, to a price of 22 pounds. All other bonds remained unchanged. The supply and demand of physical goods in London were both quiet.</p>

Currently, the financial market is easing, and there are some buyers for Kung Ho Hsiang and tram stocks, as well as power and telephone company bonds. Rubber stock trading is sluggish.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Rehabilitation Public Bonds</h3>
<p>Sixth Lottery Draw</p>
<p>The 25th year Sichuan Province Rehabilitation Public Bonds, having undergone its sixth lottery draw for principal repayment, was held in Chongqing on the 15th of this month. Winning numbers were 05 and 29. The principal and accrued interest due will be paid by the Chongqing Central Bank and the China and Communications Banks, starting from the 31st of this month.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: New Transactions Quiet, All Sluggish; National Cloth Rises and Falls; Market Prices Gradually Converge</h3>
<p>National cloth, including white cotton, fine cloth, and coarse cloth, saw weak sales due to sluggish demand. Retailers were eager to sell their goods, causing market prices to trend downwards. Yesterday, the price of each bolt continued to decrease by about five fen, in contrast to the rising prices of Eastern cloth. Previously, national cloth was expensive, but now prices are gradually converging. The situation is similar to that after the Japanese army landed in Daya Bay last autumn, where key sales areas were suddenly impacted, leading to this phenomenon. Fine drills sold relatively smoothly in the past, and the price of Eastern fine drills has been rising sharply for several days, so the market price has stabilized. New transactions were universally quiet yesterday. Cantonese merchants were preoccupied with new military actions and lacked enthusiasm for purchasing. Only wholesalers from local Shanghai shops and guerrilla areas in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces had more demand, accounting for the majority of transactions. Wuhu merchants greatly increased their purchases, adding more than 300 items of fine cloth, blue cloth, crepe, and bleached cloth.</p>
<p>Eastern cloth saw a market-wide surge yesterday, with prices rising sharply by five fen per bolt due to the purchase of more than 400 pieces of fine cloth and fine drills by Tianjin merchants, and about 1,000 pieces of gray cloth by local dyehouses. Twelve-pound "Dragon Head" fine cloth sold for 12.1 yuan, and fine drills for 12.05 yuan. Trading houses were optimistic about the market, with Itō taking in more than 100 bales of patterned fine cloth at a price of 12.2 to 12.25 yuan per bolt. Although the end of the month is approaching, merchants are unwilling to lower prices, and the market is tight, with the potential for continued price increases.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, 535 items were shipped to Tianjin and 120 items to Yantai.</p>
<h3>Substitute Permits: Unexpected Losses Incurred</h3>
<p>Last spring, woolen goods were actively traded, and standard market prices only rose without falling. According to investigations of customer transactions, eight or nine out of ten transactions were cash. Due to transportation difficulties, most goods were sent by postal parcel. For goods that could be packed in entire boxes and transported to their destination by ship, they were transported in their original boxes to avoid delays, ensure the goods were complete, prevent them from being soiled, and because inspections in the interior were very strict, requiring the original design and original permit. Some time ago, a merchant named Kang had a box of goods shipped to Wenzhou. The partner did not report to the manager and privately agreed with the customer to use a substitute permit. When the goods arrived in Zhejiang Province, they were detained due to discrepancies in the detailed inspection. Fortunately, they were of British manufacture. However, taxes and fines amounted to 440 yuan. If non-Western goods were mixed in, in addition to confiscating the goods, strict action would be taken. It was learned yesterday that the matter had been resolved, with the buyer and seller each bearing half of the 440 yuan. In the future, the store should not be greedy for business, and buyers should not ambiguously agree to use substitute permits to avoid losses.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Small Transactions of English and French Silk Sales</h3>
<p>The overseas silk market is slightly weak, with New York prices falling by one or two points. The exchange opened with futures prices down by two or three points. Yokohama's opening price was down by about ten yuan. Lyon silk prices remained unchanged. Shanghai factories have already shown signs of opening. Previous silk cables sent out by French firms had turned to Shanghai, but the arrival price was still about 20 yuan lower, resulting in a lack of large-scale opening. Only Carrié completed transactions for 20-22 striped silk, returning 30 dan, at a price of 1640 yuan, a sharp drop of more than 200 yuan from the highest price. American firms have been inquiring about Ji Li silk. Yesterday, 10 dan of Jin Xin Shen were imported at a price of 1030 yuan, an increase of 30 yuan compared to the previous price. 10 dan of Qian Jin Jing were imported from Indian firms at a price of 800 yuan.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 147 items of tea were transported from Hong Kong, and another 126 items came from Ningbo.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Both Coarse White and Refined White Sugar Rise Slightly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign sugar prices increased slightly by a few jiao compared to the day before (27th), with a strong upward trend. The guild's negotiated price for spot 24 coarse white sugar was 24.75 yuan, 24.85 yuan for local warehouse goods, and 25.15 yuan for Da Jin Qian brand. TaiXA brand rose by five fen to 24.6 yuan. 300 bags of 24 coarse white for re-export traded at 16.65 yuan, with local warehouse goods at 16.75 yuan. Re-export goods remained at 11 yuan. Tai Koo refined white sugar at the East warehouse was 24.65 yuan for B mark, and the West warehouse was 24.775 yuan. CW mark was 24.65 yuan, CX mark was 24.55 yuan, DY mark was 24.45 yuan, and HX mark was 24.3 yuan. 24 coarse white sugar for goods arriving on April 1st was negotiated at 5.1 Dutch guilders, with 750 bags traded. Only Chaozhou merchants quoted the price of second-grade upper white sugar at 23.2 to 23 yuan, with more than 100 bags traded. Due to the arrival of goods from fruit shops and Chaojian merchants, the market situation was extremely chaotic, and no opening price was set. However, according to a letter from Gulangyu, the current market price must be 14.00 yuan, which is difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 220 bags of imported sugar came from Hong Kong and 400 bags came from Shantou.</p>
<h3>Dried and Preserved Goods: Walnut Meat Firm and Expensive</h3>
<p>Walnut meat has been rising in price along with walnuts for several days, increasing by 4-5 yuan to 6-7 yuan. Yesterday's market prices were 90 yuan for walnut slices, 66 yuan for Jinan walnut meat, 62 yuan for Tianjin walnut meat, 45-46 yuan for light-colored tiger skin walnut meat, 42 yuan for ordinary first-grade, and 36 yuan for second-grade.</p>
<h3>Oilseed Cakes: Soybean Oil Reaches New High Price; Soybean Cakes Become Goods Waiting for Customers</h3>
<p>Soybean oil: Yesterday's market conditions were completely prosperous amidst rising prices in Dalian, with both spot and futures prices reaching new highs. Currently, futures prices have surpassed spot prices, mainly because the arrival and inventory volume this month is quite thick, but sales venues are still lacking enthusiastic competition. Yesterday, 200 pieces of Yanchi oil were traded at a price of 23.5 yuan, 100 pieces of Lianqi oil at a price of 30.45 yuan, 50 large baskets at a price of 30.3 yuan, and 200 cans of Da Yun canned oil at a price of 31.2 yuan. The current price of 250 barrels of Dalian oil is from 32.8 yuan to 33 yuan. More than 1,000 barrels for April are priced at 32.75 yuan and 33.05 yuan, and 800 barrels for May are priced at 32.85 yuan to 33.05 yuan.</p>
<p>Peanut oil remains sluggish, resulting in a lack of vitality in the market. However, Jiaozhou oil for April added one jiao at the close, with 150 pieces sold at a price of 27 yuan and 27.1 yuan. 20 pieces of spot goods were traded at a price of 28.4 yuan, and 500 cans of Yantai canned oil were priced at 37.2 yuan.</p>
<p>Soybean cakes still have little potential interest. The current cake sales market is not a peak season, resulting in a situation where goods are waiting for customers. Yesterday, the price of Jiangbei small cakes fell by one fen, with 6,000 pieces traded at a price of 0.99 yuan. Dayou Four Brand cakes remained at the original price of 3.48 yuan, with 900 pieces purchased by Fuzhou merchants. Futures cakes also lacked prosperity, with only kick-the-ball transactions on the market. A total of 1,000 pieces for June were agreed upon at a price of 3.165 yuan, and 4,000 pieces for May were priced at 3.15 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: Beiyang Merchants Continue Purchases; No Additional Flour; Wheat Stalls Again</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, the factory flour and foreign flour markets were generally stable. Factory flour has been attracting sales from Beiyang merchants since its price reduction. Recently, the Beiyang merchants' demand for foreign flour has also been good, as traders can profit from it. It was heard yesterday that the production price of American and Australian flour was stable, with few futures transactions temporarily. The current foreign flour that trading houses have ordered is also mostly held onto, unwilling to sell lightly. After the factories once promoted their current flour, seeing that the sales channels had turned weak, the factory prices were also unwilling to decline again. Therefore, yesterday the factory price of No. 2 flour remained at the original price of 4.55 yuan. On the local front, with the special price offered to customers, there were also plans to demand further reductions, so the wholesale price on the local front was sold at 4.5 yuan. A total of more than 10,000 bags of factory flour were traded across the market. In addition to local and Nanyang merchants making retail purchases, the rest were purchased by merchants from Hebei and Shandong. It was also heard that Beiyang merchants continued to purchase a batch of foreign flour, totaling 24,500 bags, at a price of 4.3 to 4.25 yuan (current sand).</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the source of supply was still lacking. In addition to factory-ordered foreign wheat arriving in batches, only a few dozens to two or three hundred bags of local wheat arrived by boat. After the customer price of Yinjiang wheat was sold at 7 yuan the day before, yesterday the market customers complained about the high price, the factory price was even more demanding, and the goods holders still wanted to maintain the price. As a result, the formal market stalled again.</p>
<p>Exports: Today, 3,500 bags of flour were shipped to Tianjin, 2,000 bags to Weihaiwei, and 1,000 bags to Yantai.</p>
<h3>After Shops Increase Retail Prices, Customer Xian Rice Sales Suddenly Increase; For a Win-Win Situation, Dum Rice Situation is Also Tight</h3>
<p>Customer xian rice: Yesterday, the local market digestion suddenly surged. There were not many clients entertaining customers. As local shops raised the prices of high-quality goods, the sales volume of medium and lower grades will definitely increase. And the amount of xian rice mixed with japonica rice is also not small. As a result, customer xian rice from Nanjing and Wuhu were actively purchased by shops, and even factory retailers were quite active. The total daily transaction volume increased to more than 4,000 dan. Market prices were immediately raised by nearly one jiao to one and a half jiao. Nanjing xian rice rose to 13.45 yuan, and high-quality Wuhu xian rice required 13.23 yuan. Sales were mostly between 13 yuan and 12.67 yuan. Both imports and exports of Saigon rice were small, remaining around 17 yuan.</p>
<p>Dum rice: The source of supply only arrived at No. 7 River, with more than 1,200 bags from Su and Tong merchants in Baizi cars, and more than 280 bags from Xiaokunshan merchants. With the arrival of goods being scarce, the early market sentiment was firm. Later, the local market and hoarders successively became active, and the situation became even tighter. The market showed a good appearance. As a result, the prices of thick and thin japonica rice all increased by one jiao, and the prices of Du Yangjian and Bu Jian also increased by several fen to nearly one jiao. Due to the news that there was no border closure for patterned goods in the interior, people's hearts were quite relaxed, and the prices had already risen, so there was no change in the market, and the original prices were maintained.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Tianjin Merchants Make Large Purchases; 5,000-6,000 Dan Opened</h3>
<p>The hardware trade was quite lively yesterday, with customer merchants' purchases being particularly crowded. A total of 5,000-6,000 dan was opened throughout the city. Among them, more than 1,200-1,300 dan of new lead wire were traded. The purchasers were mostly Tianjin merchants. Due to the insufficient supply, prices soared by two or three yuan. For example, the price of each piece of color No. 21-25 rose to 28 yuan, the price of middle-grade colors also increased to 20 yuan, and the selling price of coarse colors was around 23-24 yuan. More than 100 boxes of 200-pound company iron were purchased by Tianjin and Yantai merchants at a price of 56 yuan, an increase of one yuan. 40-50 barrels of No. 5 white lead sheet were purchased by local battery factories and customer merchants at a price of 215 yuan, which was also one yuan higher than the previous price. Black iron billets were out of stock due to the frenzied purchases of Tianjin merchants, at a price of 30.05 yuan. It was heard that 200 boxes were delivered yesterday, which were futures within one week. 600-700 barrels of this factory's nails were sold by local customers at a price of 17.25 yuan, an increase of 0.25 yuan. 200 dan of Hunan blue lead were purchased by Huangdan factories at a price of 36.5 yuan. Other items such as bamboo steel bars, new Lu leather, new iron wire, angle iron, I-beam, new foreign yuan black iron nails, tin, copper skin, and white lead were also traded yesterday, but the transaction volume was not large and the prices did not rise, so they are not recorded.</p>
<h3>Imports and Exports: Kiln Goods and Asphalt Arrive</h3>
<p>After the source of Rong goods from Jiujiang porcelain became unreliable, Shantou kiln goods often arrived in large quantities to alleviate the shortage. Yesterday, another 4,370 pieces were transported from Shantou.</p>
<p>Tobacco leaves have also been imported from time to time. Yesterday, 33 items came from Hong Kong and 314 items came from Ningbo.</p>
<p>Asphalt: 660 cans and 641 items produced in Zhejiang were transshipped and imported from Ningbo yesterday.</p>
<p>Today, 4,000 pieces of small bamboo were shipped to Yantai.</p>

<h3>Central Government Actively Strengthens Military Attack Power in Guerrilla Areas, Plans to Adjust Measures and Orders Implementation, Pays Attention to Transforming People's Livelihood Organizations</h3>
<p>In order to actively prepare for the recovery of lost territories, the Central Government is extremely concerned about the current situation in guerrilla areas. It has sent special commissioners to various regions to conduct inspections, strengthen political training, and adjust organizational structures. It has now formulated adjustment measures and ordered all units and county magistrates to implement them. The measures are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Adjust Guerrillas</p>
<p>Each county's guerrilla team must be organized and commanded in a unified manner with the county as the unit, in accordance with the Central Government's war of resistance strategy. After an area is occupied, guerrilla warfare should be launched immediately in order to gradually deplete the enemy's "military strength," "manpower," and "financial resources." Those in leadership positions must personally lead officers and soldiers to actively engage and work hard, carrying out a desperate war of resistance. Hereafter, the county should be the unit, with one commander per county. All guerrilla teams in a county should be rigorously trained so that mutual restraint and infighting can be eliminated, the strength of the war of resistance can be increased, and county administration can be smoothly promoted.</p>
<p>Personnel Appointments</p>
<p>The current period is an extraordinary period, a time when the nation has reached its final juncture, and it can also be called the most important stage of the nation's recovery. Therefore, in the "military" and "civilian" administration of a county, those who are both talented and virtuous, willing to sacrifice themselves for the country, and determined to die for righteousness should be selected and used. Only then will there be practical results.</p>
<p>Unified Finance</p>
<p>Currently, in the occupied areas, the puppet organizations have established numerous checkpoints and collected various taxes, causing great suffering to the people. A small cart cannot travel ten li without being extorted two or three times, and a merchant ship cannot travel five li without being forcibly donated three or four times. The money collected mostly ends up in private pockets. The tax collection by the guerrilla teams is also chaotic. The county government is the pivot for tax collection, but there are districts, townships, and towns that collect donations independently, and the county government cannot advise them. In areas without county governments, the guerrilla teams collect taxes, but there are large and medium detachments that collect taxes independently, and the branch detachments cannot advise them. The people bear a heavy burden, while the government benefits very little. Therefore, in the future, the financial revenue and expenditure of each county should strictly implement a unified collection and expenditure system. After adjustment, the surplus amount should be deposited in the bank and transferred to the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Transforming People's Livelihood</p>
<p>People's lives feel quite disrupted. Transforming people's lives is a basic problem of the war of resistance. In order to gain the support of the people, people's lives must be stabilized. The way to transform people's lives, in the negative aspect, lies in reducing the burden on the people, such as light taxes and levies. In the positive aspect, it lies in helping people develop production, such as rewarding small industries and commerce and promoting side occupations. In this way, the people's economy will be prosperous and their lives will be comfortable, and the financial resources for the war of resistance will be endless. Cutting off economic ties with the enemy can also be implemented simultaneously. Furthermore, organizing the people can be done smoothly, and the people's mood for resisting the enemy will also increase, greatly unleashing the strength of the war of resistance. However, these tasks cannot be done by the county government alone and must be implemented in coordination with the military authorities.</p>
<p>Organize the People</p>
<p>The people are the rear of the guerrilla army, and the guerrilla army is the vanguard of the people. Military and civilian cooperation and unified action are necessary to generate the effectiveness of the war of resistance. However, in the occupied areas, the previous township Baojia organization has been swept away, and the people have returned to a state of disunity. The military is the military, the people are the people, and the two are irrelevant. The people want to resist the enemy but have no opportunity, and the army wants to get help from the people but has no way to start. The drawback is that the people are not organized. The tasks of "propaganda," "guidance," "transportation," "intelligence," "sabotage," and "relief" can all be undertaken by the people's organizations. Moreover, the military force of the guerrilla army is limited, but the military force of the people is infinite. Mobilizing all the people to rise up and resist the enemy will greatly increase the strength and the effect will be significant, so that the goal of winning the war of resistance and building the nation will be achieved.</p>
<h3>Italian Ambassador to China, Marquis Mazio, Sails to Japan on Cruiser, Arriving in Osaka on April 4</h3>
<p>According to the French Shanghai Daily News on the 29th, the Italian cruiser Raimondo Montecuccoli, weighing 5,069 tons, is the flagship of the Italian Far East Fleet. It is said to be leaving Shanghai today. The ship carries the Italian Ambassador to China, Marquis Mazio. The destination is not disclosed, but it is said that the Japanese side is preparing to welcome the ship. According to Japanese reports, the cruiser is expected to arrive in Osaka on April 4 and Yokohama on April 9 for a friendly visit. Therefore, the Japanese side is making every effort to prepare for the reception. It is also said that the ship will stay in Japan until April 18 before setting sail elsewhere.</p>
<h3>French Municipal Council Awards Medals</h3>
<p>Highest Gold Medal to Berget</p>
<p>Council President Also Receives Award</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the French Consul General in Shanghai, Baudéan, awarded 56 medals of the French Municipal Council in Shanghai to personnel of the French army stationed in Shanghai at the French Concession Council yesterday (28th) afternoon, in recognition of the recipients' service to the French Concession during the war. Colonel Berget, commander of the French army in Shanghai, received the</p>
<p>Highest</p>
<p>Gold Medal of the Municipal Council. The Silver Medal was awarded to Captain Feubre, battalion commander of the French army in Shanghai, and 17 other officers of various ranks. 14 Bronze Medals were awarded to non-commissioned officers of the French army. Baudéan then congratulated Colonel Berget. After the ceremony, Baudéan took the opportunity to present the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs'</p>
<p>Special Gold Medal</p>
<p>to the President of the Municipal Council, Plaideau, and the Chief of Police, Feubre. Silver Medals of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs were awarded to Groppi of the French Concession Volunteer Corps and Davis of the Special Patrol Team of the Police Department.</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Opening Issue: Many Obstacles Ahead, Japanese Side Has Various Harsh Conditions, Making It Difficult for Third-Country Merchants to Endure</h3>
<p>The China Mail reported that yesterday (28th), according to personnel from a British shipping company in Shanghai, the Japanese naval authorities in Qingdao recently announced the reopening of the port, allowing ships from third countries to enter and exit. This has already been implemented. Ships can now enter the inner harbor and use the various docks in the inner harbor. Ships of the company have already unloaded goods at the inner harbor docks without encountering any obstacles. Before the announcement was issued, foreign ships could only unload goods in the outer harbor, and several days before arriving at the port, they had to report the</p>
<p>Nature and Quantity of Goods</p>
<p>to the Japanese Naval Special Service Team in Qingdao before being allowed to unload goods at the various docks. Also, a British businessman in the shipping industry yesterday told the outside world that the Japanese side planned to restore third-country shipping in the Yangtze River area after opening Qingdao. This was not believed. It is said that consultations between the Japanese authorities and representatives of third countries are still at a standstill. Yesterday, it was also heard that the Japanese authorities insisted that ships from third countries sailing on the Yangtze River must register with the Japanese authorities. This will inevitably cause great differences of opinion. Representatives of third countries are now trying to resolve this issue, because if</p>
<p>Shipping Registration</p>
<p>is implemented, ships sailing on the Yangtze River will be formally controlled by the Japanese side. Although information was not provided on how to implement the registration, it was learned that one of the conditions was that the Japanese authorities asked all foreign ships to fly the Japanese flag upstream of Jiangyin. It is said that this is a thorny point in the negotiations. An agreement must be reached before the Yangtze River is opened. Other issues are easier to resolve, but it is felt that the representatives of third countries will slightly oppose</p>
<p>Inspecting Foreign Ships</p>
<p>by the Japanese Navy and Army. When the reporter inquired about the transmitted information in the shipping industry yesterday, it was said that they believed that if the Yangtze River was opened according to the transmitted Japanese conditions, there would be many difficulties ahead. In view of the local political instability, many companies would hesitate before transporting goods from the interior to Shanghai. A written report received by a shipping person in Shanghai from Hankou yesterday can also confirm the</p>
<p>Inability to Restore</p>
<p>Yangtze River shipping in the short term. The report stated that it was issued on March 15 and stated that the properties of Shanghai commercial firms in Hankou had been inspected weekly and found that Japanese troops were using warehouses for storage, and naval units were also stationed in various buildings. Japanese troops still occupied their forcibly occupied floating docks, and foreigners were not allowed to go there. Furthermore, it was dangerous to enter any property owned by foreigners.</p>
<h3>Swedish Minister Leaves Shanghai to Return Home</h3>
<p>Will Take Half a Year's Vacation</p>
<p>The Great Array Newspaper reported that the Swedish Minister to China, Baron Beck-Friis, is scheduled to return to Sweden on the Mestham ship this afternoon (29th) for a six-month vacation. During his departure from Shanghai, he will be succeeded by Acting Consul General Knorring. According to Beck, he first came to Shanghai in April 1936 as Consul General. In June of the following year, he established the Swedish Legation in China and was promoted to the first Swedish Minister to China. He will return to Shanghai within this year to resume his post.</p>
<h3>City Flies Flags at Half-Mast, Mourning the Martyrs' Day, Demonstrating the Patriotic Spirit of the People in the Isolated Island, Concession Authorities Maintain Strict Vigilance for Peaceful Order</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the martyrdom of the seventy-two martyrs of Huanghuagang, designated by the central government as Revolutionary Martyrs' Day. All sectors lowered flags to half-mast and ceased entertainment. Qing Tian Bai Ri (Blue Sky White Sun) flags were seen flying everywhere in the city, creating a somber and solemn atmosphere. Concession authorities intensified their vigilance, maintaining a peaceful order. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>City Flies Flags at Half-Mast and Ceases Entertainment</p>
<p>To commemorate the great achievements of the revolutionary martyrs and their heroic spirit of sacrificing for the country, all major companies, shops, and residences in the city yesterday lowered their flags to half-mast and ceased entertainment for the day. The national emblem of Qing Tian Bai Ri flags was flying everywhere, especially in the French Concession, creating a solemn and somber atmosphere, fully demonstrating the enthusiasm of the people in the isolated island for supporting the government and resisting until the end. This gave a significant response to the so-called "anniversary of the establishment of the Reformed Government", further proving that the people's hearts are not dead and that resistance will surely succeed. At the same time, all agencies such as post offices, customs, and various organizations and schools took a day off as usual to express their condolences. Citizens from all walks of life also promoted thrift and disaster relief, and national spiritual mobilization, in order to strive for the final victory and complete the great cause of nation-building.</p>
<p>Commemorative Leaflets Discovered Everywhere</p>
<p>Yesterday was Revolutionary Martyrs' Day, and all sectors used the most exciting and solemn emotions to commemorate the martyrs. Patriotic organizations also distributed commemorative leaflets and colorful slogans in various places, which pedestrians picked up and read one after another. The contents of the slogans are recorded as follows: (1) Support the supreme leader, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, (2) Absolutely adhere to the Three Principles of the People for saving the country, (3) Vigorously implement the outline and implementation measures of the National Spiritual Mobilization, (4) Thoroughly refuse to cooperate with the enemy and puppets, (5) Actively participate in military service, (6) Conscientiously carry out the New Life Movement, (7) Strive to use domestic goods, (8) Expand the thrift and donation movement.</p>
<p>Concession Vigilance Maintains Peaceful Order</p>
<p>The police authorities of the two concessions, in order to prevent unexpected incidents, maintained strict vigilance yesterday. Many Chinese and Western detectives were stationed at all important traffic intersections to search pedestrians, and patrol teams were organized and assigned to patrol various roads. The White Russian Merchant Corps also mobilized to assist. In the areas beyond the boundaries of the Shanghai West Road, the US military stationed in Shanghai ordered US soldiers to post guards everywhere. In the French Concession, all Chinese, French, Vietnamese, and Russian police officers were mobilized to patrol, and additional guards were dispatched to various intersections to conduct inspections of pedestrians at any time. Therefore, the order was peaceful throughout the day, and no incidents occurred.</p>
<p>Japanese and Puppets Intensify Defense in the Suburbs of Shanghai</p>
<p>According to a reporter from the Modern News Agency, yesterday was Revolutionary Martyrs' Day, and it was also the so-called "anniversary of the establishment of the Reformed Government". The Japanese and puppets were deeply afraid that the guerrillas in the near suburbs would take the opportunity to become active and carry out attacks. Therefore, from Baoshan Road to the main intersections in the city center, the puppet "Constitution Guards" and puppet police were stationed, and many Japanese troops were added to guard. They abused searches of citizens entering and exiting, and inflicted abuse and insults if they were slightly dissatisfied. Although the Pujiang ferry was not blocked, the search was extremely strict.</p>

<h3>Situation in Western Shanghai Becomes Tense Again</h3>
<p>Puppet "Pacification Army" Transferred to Shanghai Again</p>
<p>Guerrillas Have Deployed to Intercept</p>
<p>It is reported that the Nanjing puppet "Pacification Department" is now transferring another 1,000 puppet troops to the four suburbs of Shanghai to replace the Japanese army's rear defense. Some of them have arrived at the border between Shanghai West and the South City. Some will also be transferred to Pudong. Therefore, Commander Wang Jinshan of the 5th Column of the Guerrilla Force yesterday transferred the 2nd Special Task Force, Niu Qilin, and the 3rd Special Task Force, Xu Sheng, to Xinjing, Zhoujiaqiao, Hongqiao Road, Xietu Road, and both sides of the Suzhou River Railway in northwestern Shanghai to cut off the connection of the puppet army. Therefore, the situation in the western district is tense.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Did Not Take a Holiday on Martyrs' Day</h3>
<p>Japanese Staff Sitting Idle Reading Newspapers</p>
<p>Not a Single Chinese Staff Member Seen</p>
<p>Announcements Are Like Empty Words</p>
<p>Yesterday was the anniversary of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang. All sectors of the city hung flags at half-mast to commemorate them. Schools in the city were closed, and post offices and customs also posted announcements that they would take a holiday as usual. However, the day before yesterday (the 28th), a reporter met an employee of a shipping company, who said that the company happened to have a ship unloading coal tomorrow (i.e. yesterday). According to the customs regulations, ships working on holidays must pay the customs in advance for a permit. Therefore, he went to the customs to buy a permit in the afternoon of the 28th. At the same time, someone from a certain Japanese trading company was also buying a permit. At that time, the Japanese customs officer said that the customs would not be closed tomorrow (i.e. take a holiday) and there was no need to buy a permit. The person left and came back later to buy a permit and left. Yesterday morning at eleven o'clock and one o'clock in the afternoon, the reporter went to the customs to observe the situation. At the Bund of Sanma Road, he saw the customs door wide open, the same as usual. He immediately went upstairs and saw that there were only a few Japanese and Western customs officers sitting idle in the writing rooms reading newspapers. Not a single Chinese clerk was seen. There were also three or five tax police officers sitting on benches in the corridor chatting idly. There were only three or five people reporting to the customs. According to this situation, the customs has been completely dominated by the Japanese, and the holiday announcement has become empty words.</p>
<h3>Salt Tax Intercepted in Occupied Areas, Salt from Changlu and Other Areas Robbed and Transported Out, Ample Salt Reserves Nationwide Thanks to Government Rushed Shipments, Increased Production</h3>
<p>After our country's coastal areas unfortunately fell, the salt tax was intercepted by the Japanese. Salt from Changlu and other areas was also robbed and transported to Japan. Fortunately, since the 25th year, our government had supervised and urged the coastal producing areas to transfer the salt stored in the fields to the interior. Therefore, no salt shortage occurred in various places after the war. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Japanese Rob Salt Production in Coastal Areas</p>
<p>Salt is divided into two major categories: crude salt and refined salt. The former is divided into well salt, rock salt, pond salt, and sea salt. The latter is made by processing the former as raw materials. Almost all coastal provinces in our country produce sea salt. According to its region, it is divided into seven major regions: Changlu, Shandong, Lianghuai, Liangzhe, Liangguang, Fujian, and the three northeastern provinces. Among them, Lianghuai, Shandong, and Changlu produce the most salt. After the war, the above three regions were occupied, and the producing areas were robbed by Japan. Taking Changlu salt as an example, it has been controlled by the Japanese company of the South Manchuria Railway. The quantity transported to Japan has increased from 70,000 tons to 450,000 tons. The salt produced in Changlu is about 850,000 tons. Now the salt exported to Japan exceeds half of the production.</p>
<p>Salt Tax Intercepted in Occupied Areas</p>
<p>Within the occupied areas, the salt tax has been intercepted by the Japanese. However, the principal and interest of the Chinese and foreign loans guaranteed by the salt tax are still paid by the Ministry of Finance after the war. Now, due to environmental reasons, we have to adopt the same method as the repayment of various debts guaranteed by tariffs. The salt production figures in the occupied areas in the 21st year are recorded as follows: (1) Chang approximately 4,439,000 dan, (2) Lianghuai approximately 7,565,000 dan, (3) Shandong approximately 7,589,000 dan, (4) Koubei approximately 200,700 dan, (5) Hedong approximately 891,000 dan, (6) Jinbei approximately 194,000 dan, (7) Yangzhou approximately 600,900 dan, (6) Songjiang approximately 188,000 dan,</p>
<p>Rushing to Transport Stored Salt and Increase Production</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance believes that salt is crucial to the national economy and people's livelihood, especially during wartime, it is even more important. It is necessary to have sufficient reserves of salt in various places. However, during peacetime, salt trading in various places adopted a transport and sales system. Merchants were reluctant to store a lot of salt for the sake of protecting funds. In peacetime, the salt stored in various sales locations was only enough for a few days of sales. Therefore, since the 25th year, it has successively supervised and urged the coastal producing areas to actively find ways to transfer the huge amount of salt stored in the fields to the interior for storage as ordinary edible salt, and vigorously increase production in eastern Zhejiang, southern Sichuan, northern Sichuan, Fujian, Guangdong, Yunnan, Gansu, Qinghai, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and other places.</p>
<p>Adjusting Edible Salt at Any Time During the War</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the July 7th Anti-Japanese War, it has considered the demand for edible salt in various places, distinguished between urgent and slow needs, and actively transported and stored and promoted sales, without hindering progress due to the lack of transportation. For example, the salt produced in eastern Zhejiang, Yuyao, Daishan, and other places was rushed to the rear by the Ministry due to the proximity of the area to the war zone. They have already been rushed and transferred to various places in the southwest via the Zhejiang-Jiangxi and Hunan-Guangxi railways. Now the supply and demand of edible salt in various places can be properly adjusted at any time, and a large amount of edible salt is stored in certain places in the rear, so no salt shortage has ever occurred in various places.</p>
<h3>Japanese Invade Tou Niu Du, Encounter Flank Attack</h3>
<p>Tou Niu Du in Pudong is a small town at the entrance and exit of the South Huangpu River crossing. At 1:00 PM the other day (28th), the Japanese Minhang Headquarters suddenly dispatched more than 100 naval and army troops, divided into more than ten speedboats, to invade the town. At that time, it happened that the Shanghai-Jinhui Bridge Pinghu Company’s Hengbao Wan ferry was towing a rice boat from Jin back to Shanghai, passing through the area. It coincided with the Japanese army probing Tou Niu Du for landing, using small boats and rice boats as cover, and fired remotely, killing an 18-year-old boy on the rice boat with a bullet. At this time, the sentry of the guerrillas on the Pudong side of Tou Niu Du heard the gunfire and saw a large Japanese army invading. He immediately reported to the team headquarters to dispatch troops to meet the enemy. In the end, the Japanese warships in the river helped with fierce artillery fire, and temporarily moved east. After the Japanese army landed, the people in the town had already fled with the army. The Japanese attempted to advance deeply eastward. About two miles away from the town, the guerrillas had already made arrangements and surrounded and attacked from three sides. A fierce battle began. The sound of dense machine guns and cannons mixed together. Because the guerrillas were familiar with the geography and received some support, they outflanked and attacked. After two or three hours of fierce fighting, the Japanese army suffered more than 30 casualties, was unable to support, and retreated to Tou Niu Du. Angered, they set fire to two or thirty market houses and more than ten surrounding villages, a total of five or sixty houses, to vent their anger. Now the Chinese army is holding the line in Zhaojialou.</p>
<h3>Tai Yu Wei Port, Navigation Line Halted</h3>
<p>Inland Freight Rerouted</p>
<p>Changyinsha Hupu Port</p>
<p>The Jiangyin Zhangjiagang flight has stopped, and inland passenger and freight transport has been rerouted to Tai Zi Wei Port for transit. Foreign shipping companies have successively dispatched ships to sail, and passenger and freight transport has suddenly become prosperous. According to news from the shipping industry, on the 27th of this month, guerrillas once rushed into the port to attack, and a battle occurred. The situation there is very chaotic, and flights have been suspended. Some of the inland passenger and freight transport has been rerouted to Changyinsha Hupu Port and other places for transit to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>National Spiritual Mobilization Movement, Branch Organizations Will Be Established, General Assembly Actively Starts Work, All Citizens Must Participate</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal National Spiritual Mobilization Association announced its establishment, it recently convened its first Standing Committee meeting. The heads of various departments and the promoters of branch organizations have been appointed and have actively started work. It is heard that the National Spiritual Mobilization Associations of the agricultural, industrial, educational, and cultural circles will be established separately within days. The General Assembly has drafted specific measures for seeking members, so that all citizens will participate in this organization and unanimously follow the National Spiritual Mobilization Outline.</p>
<h3>Strictly Prevent Smuggled Goods from Being Sold Mixed, Cigarettes Must Have Proof for Inland Transport, Goods Already Taxed by Japanese and Puppets Confiscated and Prosecuted, Saving Unnecessary Consumption and Avoiding Tax Funds to Aid the Enemy</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the domestic sales of smuggled goods from occupied areas and the export of domestic native goods to aid the enemy, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Economic Affairs have specifically stipulated that 54 kinds of native goods are prohibited from being transported to occupied areas. In addition to necessities that can be transported in with proof from chambers of commerce and other groups, other consumables such as cigarettes have been implicitly restricted for goods transported from occupied areas to the interior. Since the Shanghai Customs was robbed, anything that has been taxed in Shanghai, even if it needs to be taxed again for sale in the interior, is nothing more than selling goods taxed to aid the enemy. Among them, Chinese and foreign cigarettes are the most serious, because the Japanese and puppets levy a special cigarette tax, which is heavier than any other tax. Therefore, in the future, all cigarettes transported to Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangxi, Yunnan, and other provinces must have proof of fact before they can be reported for transport. All goods that have been taxed in the occupied areas will be confiscated and prosecuted.</p>

<h3>Commemorating Ma Xiangbo and Li Denghui, Raising Funds to Build "Xianghui Hall", Site Already Selected in Beibei, Sichuan, Will Invite Ma and Li to Live There</h3>
<p>Qian Xinzhi, the president of Fudan University, in order to commemorate Mr. Ma Xiangbo, the founder of the university, and Mr. Li Denghui, the former president, initiated the construction of a memorial hall on Mr. Ma's 100th birthday this year. It is learned that a site has been selected near the university's new residence in Beibei, Sichuan, covering dozens of acres, and engineers have drafted a construction plan with a budget of 10,000 yuan. Qian alone contributed 3,000 yuan. In addition to asking the school directors to donate, if there is a shortfall, the school will raise funds separately. Construction will begin soon, and it has been decided that the name of the memorial hall will be "Xianghui Hall", which contains the meaning of reflecting each other's brilliance. It is heard that once completed, Ma and Li will be invited to live there.</p>
<h3>Japanese Army, Blockades Zhabei</h3>
<p>The Japanese army, fearing that plainclothes teams would attack Zhabei again, has implemented a blockade of the traffic around Zhabei. On the main road from Baoshan Road through North Sichuan Road to Yokohama Bridge, a Japanese engineering team installed a power grid and piled up sandbags and obstacles yesterday (the 28th) to prevent the outbreak of war. The situation is extremely tense.</p>
<h3>International Settlement Volunteer Corps, Scheduled Drill</h3>
<p>Marches into the Concession from West Shanghai. The A Battalion of the International Settlement Volunteer Corps in the Shanghai Public Concession will hold a large-scale parade in West Shanghai on the second of next month. It is learned that the team will not be parading on that day, but will be drilling at the racecourse. At that time, it will enter the concession from West Shanghai and march on the roads as infantry. This drill is an annual event for the team. The A Battalion includes the Scottish Team, the Jewish Team, and five other teams.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Plans to Add More Tax Collection Offices</h3>
<p>A Total of Six Locations, Including Maigen Road</p>
<p>Office to Begin Early Next Month</p>
<p>In view of the fact that various native goods and applied articles are frequently exported or imported at the main roads and ports in the border areas of the concession, Jianghai Customs has decided to prepare for the establishment of six more tax collection offices in order to make it difficult to evade taxes and smuggle. It is heard that the locations include Maigen Road, the Mint, Xujiahui, Fanhuangdu, and the South Railway Station. Since preparations began at the beginning of this month, they have been actively proceeding. The office locations and responsible personnel have been arranged and formally established, and various tax collection regulations have been formulated. In the future, whether goods are exported from the concession or native products are imported from the interior, taxes will be collected according to regulations. Yesterday, it was learned from relevant parties that the six tax collection offices will begin operating in early next month. As for the five tax collection offices at the North Railway Station, North Suzhou Road, Bailinan Road, Daxi Road, and Hongqiao Road, they will collect customs duties from people of any nationality who transport goods in accordance with the regulations. As for the Wusong Tax Collection Office, it is still in the process of negotiation, and it will begin operating as soon as it is ready.</p>
<h3>Post-War Vitality Has Not Recovered, Unable to Withstand Rent Increases</h3>
<p>More Than a Hundred Businesses Ask Landlords to Be Considerate</p>
<p>Willing to Add a 22% Surcharge for Water</p>
<p>More than a hundred businesses in the city, including Tongchuntang, Xie Fengtai, Songtai Rice Store, Fukang Sauce Garden, Baiyun Temple, Weida Dyeing Workshop, Xin Yongji, Ye Ruixiangzhai, Shunchangxiang, Shenkang Dang, Xinsheng Rice Store, Baoshengtang, Taishengtang, etc., jointly sent a letter to the landlord, Lao Gongmao Foreign Firm Rental Department, saying, "Respected Sirs, on March 1, we received a letter from your firm's rental department stating that land tax, water fees, and other expenses have all increased, and that rent will be charged at 45% of the current rent from April 1, and payment must be made in legal tender. Accordingly, the tenants requested Chen Baode, Sun Wen'an, and seven other neighbors to represent all the tenants and come to your firm's rental department to state the difficulties of business and request consideration and the withdrawal of the order. We were fortunate to have Mr. Chen Shangda come forward to talk, but it has been more than half a month and we have not received a reply or adoption. The tenants believe that the increase in land tax mentioned by your firm's rental department is not significant, and the water fee is only charged at the actual amount, and other expenses are even smaller. It does not seem to be a reason to increase the rent by a large amount. As for the statement in the letter that those who are unwilling to comply must move out and return the house by the end of March, it is even more contrary to human feelings. The tenants risked danger and stayed in this house during the war, and although the front line has moved west, vitality has not recovered, and a sudden increase in a huge burden is impossible to bear. Everyone knows the prosperity and decline of commerce on the north and south banks of the Suzhou River. The rent increase in Bannan has not been heard to increase by more than 20 or 30 percent, let alone in Banbei. Moreover, Shanghai's landlords estimated the rent amount early when they built the buildings and planned for the overall situation. It is not possible to have the異想 of taking advantage of the situation. Our landlords and tenants are all merchants, and we speak as merchants. Therefore, the tenants are willing to pay rent according to the old amount in 1935 for the actual water fee, which the landlord may have some losses on. However, we declare that the increase of 12% will be used as a subsidy for water consumption. As for the payment in legal tender, the number of tenants who use划條 for payment is limited, and why bother about it after years of established practice? We are presenting the true situation, and we hope that you will respect our decision and reply."</p>
<h3>Czech Legation Closed, Shanghai Municipal Council Has Received Notification</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council has received a notification stating that the Czech Legation in Shanghai closed on the 17th of this month, and the consular files of the legation were also received by the German Consulate General in Shanghai on the same day.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Economic Affairs Exerting Efforts to Develop Mineral Resources, Managing the Centralized Port Export of Mineral Products, Export of Mineral Sands Has Increased Compared to Pre-War</h3>
<p>In order to develop inland mineral resources and increase production, the Ministry of Economic Affairs, in cooperation with the Resources Commission, has established copper and iron factories and mining bureaus. It is managing major mineral products, centralizing them in Hong Kong, and exporting them overseas. The export of mineral sands has increased compared to pre-war. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Developing Mineral Resources and Increasing Production</p>
<p>The council previously cooperated with the Ordnance Department to dismantle important parts of the Hanyang Iron and Steel Plant and the Daye Iron Mine and transport them inland, and also transported the Liuhegou Iron Furnace inland to build copper and iron factories in other places, costing approximately 10 million yuan. The Resources Commission has set up a copper factory in Hunan to refine pure copper, and purchased raw copper in Sichuan and Kang provinces, and jointly operated the Dianbei Copper Mine to increase production. It has revised the Mining Law, designated state-owned mining areas, and promulgated regulations on rewarding industrial and mining enterprises and measures to encourage overseas Chinese investment in domestic economic enterprises, with the aim of actively developing inland mineral resources and increasing production.</p>
<p>Establishing Offices to Manage Centralized Exports</p>
<p>Major mineral products have been managed by the competent authorities, such as tungsten, antimony, tin, and copper. These mineral products are centralized in Hong Kong and exported overseas. The export of mineral sands has not decreased sharply due to the war. The exports in the past year and the year before have increased compared to the 25th year. For example, mineral sands, metals, and metal products were worth 56,742,800 yuan in the 25th year, 102,452,605 yuan in the 26th year, 106,857,0542 yuan in the 27th year, and 14,157,471 yuan from January to February this year.</p>
<p>Consolidating Finance and Prospecting for Gold Mines</p>
<p>In order to replenish foreign exchange funds and consolidate finance, the ministry is prospecting for gold mines in Qing, Sichuan, Kang, Hunan, and Guangxi provinces, and is negotiating with the Ministry of Finance to set prices and purchase gold produced in various places. The gold obtained from these mines is transported overseas for use as a foreign exchange fund. Since the trial implementation, it has achieved considerable results. In addition, it is jointly operating the Shengxi Mercury Mine with the Guizhou Provincial Government to increase mercury production. The Resources Commission and the Guangxi Provincial Government are jointly operating the Pinggui Mining Bureau with a capital of 5 million yuan, which can increase tin production by about 1,000 tons per year. It has also established a Mining and Metallurgy Research Institute to study mining and metallurgy techniques.</p>
<h3>Japanese Attempt to Seize the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou Railways, Organization of the Company Confirmed in Shanghai, It is Expected That the British Authorities Will Take a Tough Stance</h3>
<p>According to the Mainland News, yesterday (the 28th), it was learned that Shanghai is following with deep concern the next action of the Japanese attempt to control the railways invested in by foreign capital. As reported last week, Tokyo has proposed the establishment of a subsidiary of the China Development Company, claiming to have a capital of 50 million yen, with the aim of operating 770 kilometers of railways in the Shanghai area. It is announced that the Beijing-Shanghai and Beijing-Hangzhou railways, formerly guaranteed by British investment, are included within the 770 kilometers. According to confirmed news yesterday, the reported organization of the company has been confirmed in Shanghai. However, no official news has been received from the Japanese authorities regarding this plan. If the Japanese side implements its plan in a simple way of seizing the two railways, which are now under the control of the Japanese army under the pretext of "military needs," it is expected that the British authorities will take a tough stance.</p>
<h3>Anhui Province War Zone Counties: Dire Disaster Situation, Urgent Need for Relief, Conquered Areas' Homes in Ruins, Especially Severe Bombing Along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway</h3>
<p>The Hua Yang Yi Zhen Hui (Chinese and Foreign Relief Association) at 97 Renji Road received a letter from the Anhui Refugee Relief Association, saying, "Calamity has befallen our China, and disorder is becoming increasingly urgent. The disaster situation in various places has varying degrees of severity, but with the country broken and homes destroyed, all are suffering the misery of displacement. After repeated comparisons, it is clear that Anhui Province has suffered the most. Now, we respectfully present a detailed account: (1) The conquered areas have all been bombed,</p>
<p>Homes are in Ruins</p>
<p>Especially severe in Xuancheng, Guangde, Datong, Wuhu, Fanchang, Changtu, Huaining, Qianshan, Susong, Taihu, Guichi, Hefei, Chaoxian, Hanshan, Hexian, Yingshang, Shouxian, Fengtai, Sixian, and Xuyi. Those who were fortunate enough to escape mostly died in ditches and gullies. Those who failed to escape were either bombed and burned to death or injured, the numbers being countless. The remaining counties, such as Jiashan, Fengyang, and Suxian, along the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, experienced</p>
<p>Especially Severe Bombing</p>
<p>with no building left intact after being burned and destroyed. Both sides of the railway have become scorched earth. People live in thatched huts, lacking both food and clothing, suffering from both hunger and cold. The disaster victims who return after wandering and seeking refuge have no place to live because their homes have been destroyed. They wander the streets, swallowing their sorrows and weeping silently, as if they were in a living hell. (2) Areas lost and then recovered, such as Tongcheng, Shucheng, Jianping, Taiping, Zhizhi, Dongliu, Wangjiang, Liuan, Huoshan, Fuyang, Woyang, Mengcheng, and Boxian, are left with devastation and desolation. Robbers and bandits</p>
<p>Seize the Opportunity to Act</p>
<p>and although some people have survived, they cannot live in peace. They lack clothing and food, no different from when they were conquered. (3) After the war disasters, yellow floods followed, affecting northern Anhui, including Fuyang, Taihe, Yingshang, Haoxian, Woyang, Mengcheng, Fengtai, Shouxian, Huaiyuan, Lingbi, Suxian, Fengyang, Wuhe, Sixian, Xuyi, and Tianchang, where the water depth reached over ten feet. There was no harvest to be reaped in autumn. Homes and livestock were washed away. People built nests of wood and lived on ridges. Although the floodwaters have now receded, the land is covered in devastation and spring planting has not yet begun.</p>
<p>Relief is Urgently Needed</p>
<p>What is even more tragic is that in the disaster-stricken counties, epidemics broke out between the summer and autumn of last year. The sick refugees had nowhere to seek medical treatment and no door to beg at, simply waiting for death. The sights were everywhere. Since winter, they have been suffering from hunger and cold, and the number of deaths is uncountable. In summary, all of the above are factual situations. If no relief measures are taken, the farmers in the counties along the Yangtze and Huai rivers will have no plowing cattle or seeds left,</p>
<p>Spring Planting is Hopeless</p>
<p>and the rise of bandits kidnapping people for ransom is still heard of from time to time. It is anticipated that the disaster situation in the days to come will be even more unimaginable. The members of our association feel deeply for our hometown and have established the Anhui Refugee Relief Association, hoping to convey the true situation of the disaster area and to seek survival after the disaster. However, with our limited strength and resources, we have no choice but to implore your esteemed association to generously provide aid and rescue this great difficulty."</p>
<h3>Jing'an Temple Police: Cracking Down on a Gambling Den</h3>
<p>A person named Mao Jian, originally a member of the criminal underworld, was unemployed and bored. He was induced by gambling den leaders Yu Ruseng (i.e., Yu Shisheng), Li Xiaobao, and Mao Axiang to set up a listening post in their opium den in a bungalow at 958 Lane, Aiwunyi Road. According to the gambling den headquarters, he would determine the outcomes of the three daily rounds of gambling and relay them to the gamblers. Therefore, setting up a listening post gave him more power than being a regular gambling runner. Mao Jian even hired Xu Jinsheng and Wang Afu as assistants. The other day, the Jing'an Temple police learned of this and dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to investigate. They found Shao Gui Gao Ajin and Chen Gendi were delivering gambling money to the headquarters and arrested them along with Xu and Wang. Mao Jian managed to escape during the confusion. The next morning, the police sent the four men and women, gambling slips, and gambling money to the First Special District Local Court. Judge Meng interrogated them and found them guilty. Xu Jinsheng and Wang Afu were each sentenced to seven months in prison, and Gao and Chen were each fined 30 yuan. The opium and gambling equipment were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Suicide</h3>
<p>Misappropriation of Public Funds: Cai Yunlong, a local young man, 21 years old, was the manager of Yongfeng Rice Store at 64 Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. Because Cai was young and inexperienced, he abused his position, frequenting prostitutes and gambling. He misappropriated a large amount of public funds and could not make up for it. At about 8:30 last night, he became disillusioned with life and ingested a heavy dose of poison. Fortunately, he was discovered early and rushed to Doulong Hospital for treatment.</p>
<p>Argument Between Husband and Wife: Yin Wangshi, a young woman from Ningbo, 24 years old, lived in the Hongfu Soap Factory at 163 Lane, Rue Robert. At about 9:00 last night, she had an argument with her husband and secretly ingested datura flower in an attempt to commit suicide. She was carried to the hospital by others.</p>
<p>Poverty Prevents Schooling: Huang Xiuzhen, a local young woman, 21 years old, lived at 657 Baker Road in the International Settlement. She was formerly a student at a certain school, but after the outbreak of war, she did not return to school. She has been studying at home. Recently, Huang Xiuzhen planned to go back to school, but her father has been unemployed for a long time and unable to pay the tuition. Unable to fulfill her wish, she suddenly became disillusioned with life at 4:30 yesterday afternoon and secretly ingested poison in an attempt to commit suicide. She was later discovered by her family and rushed to the hospital for treatment. She is severely poisoned and her life is in danger.</p>
<p>Family Discord: Shi, a young woman near the age of twenty, rented a room at 1131 Hairan Road. At about 6:34 yesterday afternoon, she had an argument with her family, which caused her resentment. Afterward, she secretly ingested raw opium in an attempt to commit suicide. She was discovered and rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Drug Trafficking Conviction</h3>
<p>Li Shugui and Liu Zhaonian, Chinese detectives, and Zhao Baosheng and Guo Shouxin, patrolmen from the Public Security Bureau's Narcotics Division, arrested Wu Ajin, a man from Pudong, on Shantou Road the other day. They seized five taels of opium. Wu revealed that the drug trafficking operation was located at 350 Shanxi Road, so the detectives went to search the premises. They arrested Zhang Xuewen and Zhang Wenhai, two men from Tongzhou, and seized 23.5 taels of opium, 58 taels of raw opium oil, 138 silver dollars, opium lamps, opium pipes, and other items. Yesterday, they were brought to the First Special District Court, Criminal Division. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, prosecuted them under the anti-opium law. The defendants hired lawyers Fan Gang and Yu Enliang to defend them. After investigation by Judge Feng Shide, Wu Ajin was sentenced to five years and six months in prison, Zhang Wenhai was sentenced to three years and six months in prison, and Zhang Xuewen was acquitted. The seized opium and other items were confiscated.</p>
<h3>Fire on Avenue Edward VII</h3>
<p>Shanxi Bookstore Burned Down</p>
<p>At about 3:20 yesterday afternoon, a fire broke out on the upper floor of the Shanxi Bookstore at 324 Avenue Edward VII. In an instant, thick smoke filled the air. Hearing the news, the patrolmen immediately arrived to maintain order and called for fire trucks to extinguish the fire. Fortunately, the fire was discovered early, and a major disaster was averted. In addition to the entire upper floor of the Shanxi Bookstore being burned down, the upper floor of the Xin Yi Tai cigarette shop next door was slightly affected. Wang Yuanliang (male, 34 years old) and his wife, Wang Xu (20 years old), who lived on the upper floor of the Shanxi Bookstore, suffered burns to their heads and hands. They were taken to Renji Hospital for treatment. The cause of the fire is unknown and is currently being investigated by the relevant police station.</p>
<h3>Truck Crashes into Store</h3>
<p>Three Store Employees and Customers Injured</p>
<p>At 6:30 yesterday afternoon, a truck (number 23108) loaded with goods was traveling near Jiangyuan Lane on Xinza Road in the International Settlement. The driver accidentally drove the truck into the Heng Hua Xiang tobacco and paper store at No. 1 Jiangyuan Lane, 271 Xinza Road. The truck crashed and destroyed a large number of store counters and merchandise.

<h3>Japanese Residents in Hongkou to Organize Self-Defense Corps, Disregarding the Concession Police Department, Intending to Manipulate Major Cases in Hongkou, No New Developments in the Murder of Kino</h3>
<p>The English-language Da Mei Wan Bao (Greater Shanghai Evening Post) reported, "Yesterday (28th), there were no developments in the shooting death of Japanese national Kino in Yangshupu. Japanese naval landing forces, cooperating with the Public Security Bureau of the International Settlement, arrested several people, and besides one being detained for interrogation, the rest have been released. At the same time, this assassination case on Linqing Road seems to have stirred up the Japanese residents of Hongkou, three miles away. It is said that they are currently organizing a self-defense corps, disregarding the Public Security Bureau of the International Settlement and various Japanese authorities. However, this statement may be inaccurate or exaggerated."</p>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Da Lu Xin Bao (Continental News) in this city, the Japanese Residents Road Association, a Japanese residents' organization in Hongkou, will organize a self-defense corps to prevent incidents similar to the murder of Kino. The members of the corps will represent Japanese residents from fifty-eight roads in Hongkou. A notice regarding the establishment of this proposed corps was issued on Tuesday to the president of each road association. The corps will be divided into several teams, under the direction of team leaders, to prevent accidents such as theft and will attempt to arrest the perpetrators of major crimes such as arson and assassination.</p>

<p>Sexual Medicine</p>
<p>— Written by Dr. Yang Daonan, Graduate of the Medical Faculty of the Russian Labor University</p>
<h3>How to Court Her After Marriage?</h3>
<p>After married life begins, the most important step is for the couple to frankly tell each other what they know, can do, and how they feel about sex. Sometimes in mutual exchanges, many subtle methods can be studied, thereby increasing the happiness of both parties. The husband can often use passionate words and various bedroom games to quickly promote the wife's reaction. Or, if he knows that he has insufficient energy or a weak sexual condition, he should actively use the latest methods to recover quickly. This is much better than the male side trying to suppress sexual climaxes, because causing congestion of the genitals can produce harmful results. From this, we can see that the timing of male and female sexual arousal is different, and it can be remedied by language, action, medicine, etc. In this way, both men and women can feel great pleasure. We can briefly summarize by saying: sexual relations should be full of mutual consideration. We can say with certainty: make your partner feel satisfied, and you will get greater pleasure!</p>
<p>Poor love between husband and wife is often caused by the husband's loss of sexual power, but once she has experienced the interest, she can also share and work together with her husband, sharing the same bed and the same dreams.</p>
<p>Men who ignore sexual hygiene are prone to premature ejaculation, impotence, and loss of reproductive function. This is undeniable. However, with regard to the treatment of this type of problem in clinical practice, the most effective is "Nutricon" for men, a genuine animal testicular endocrine agent invented by Dr. Meren of Germany. New blood is produced within 24 hours after taking it, and the limbs and bones are restored to prosperity. Guaranteed sexual health, the above-mentioned symptoms will never occur, and the love between husband and wife will increase day by day. "Nutricon" for women specializes in treating women's ailments.</p>
<h3>The Most Effective Medicine for Strengthening the Essence Gate</h3>
<p>— Dr. Zheng Ting, German Medical Doctor</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission is the most severe disease that loses essence and blood, and the cause of nocturnal emission mostly stems from masturbation. After masturbation becomes a habit, the ejaculation center is damaged, the essence gate is relaxed, and the phenomenon of nocturnal emission occurs. Young people suffering from nocturnal emission, because their essence and blood are constantly leaking, and their bodies are weakened as a result. If they are not treated properly at this time, they often turn into severe symptoms such as emission without dreams and seminal emission when seeing beauty, or there may be symptoms such as neurasthenia, weak brain, forgetfulness, back pain, etc. It is a pity that a healthy young man indulges in masturbation and loses all happiness. But to save this kind of tendency and eliminate the harm of nocturnal emission, one must first start with strengthening the essence gate. "Nairis Night Emission Pills" have a great effect on treating the above-mentioned diseases. Therefore, whether it is nocturnal emission, spermatorrhea, or seminal emission when seeing beauty, it is wonderful to start to rejuvenate. After the nocturnal emission has stopped, if the body is damaged, neurasthenia, back pain, and other symptoms, it should be supplemented with "Nutricon" for men, a German testicular essence preparation, so that any severe symptoms of weakness can be cured.</p>
<p>Venereal Disease</p>
<h3>The Liberation of Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— Written by Dr. Huang Zhongchang, American Medical Doctor</p>
<p>In the history of medical progress in the 20th century, the treatment of gonorrhea is the most important. The most popular treatment at the beginning was the membrane-penetrating sterilization method, but because gonorrhea is not completely on the mucous membrane, all parts of the blood joints have traces of gonorrhea. Therefore, this kind of membrane-penetrating sterilization method was declared a complete failure. Dr. Peter, a German medical doctor, made further research and used a special protein-pigment mixture to make "Clinon", which can produce anti-gonococcal bacteriophages in a short period of time, reducing inflammation and relieving pain. This kind of action can directly occur in the lesion, and can be called the only liberating treatment for gonorrhea patients.</p>
<p>Once infected with gonorrhea, it is like a poisonous scorpion on the body, and the pain is extraordinary, often leading to the illusion of being disgusted with the world and committing suicide. The most painful gonorrhea is the symptoms of gonococcal posterior urethritis. Because once gonorrhea enters the posterior urethra, it feels very troublesome. Because the route invaded by gonorrhea increases, and the symptoms also arise, if the general membrane-penetrating sterilization and chemical therapy are used, its sterilization effect may not be able to withstand the gonorrhea, which is like mercury pouring on the ground and is inaccessible. The reason why gonorrhea could not be cured in a short period of time in the past lies in this.</p>
<p>Now, because of the invention of "Clinon", the treatment of gonorrhea is very different from the past, and it has long been praised by doctors in Europe and the United States. According to the experiment of Dr. Baisse Zhong in his venereal disease hospital in New York, he said that he has treated gonorrhea in the hospital for more than a thousand people in 20 years, and before "Clinon" was invented, it was very difficult to ask for a radical cure for gonorrhea. However, since the invention of "Clinon", it is not as difficult as before to radically cure all stages of gonorrhea. Especially those with gonorrhea that has invaded the posterior urethra can be completely cured by taking "Clinon". The medicine is effective and the results are excellent.</p>
<p>In terms of external medicine, "Anti-gonococcal water" can be used to wash the urethra of men and remove gonorrhea, and "Carsetty vaginal suppositories" can be used externally for women's gonococcal leukorrhea to eliminate gonococcal leukorrhea, which is more effective for all kinds of gonorrhea in men and women. It is also very suitable for the principle of family self-treatment.</p>
<h3>Common Cold Turns into Consumption</h3>
<p>— Dr. Sheng Zaiqiang</p>
<p>The patient, Jin Zhenquan, 33 years old, fled with the crowd last winter because his hometown was occupied. At that time, there was heavy snow and a strong wind. He caught a cold and coughed incessantly. Because he believed in his strong physique and was worried, he did not seek medical treatment. But since last spring, he suddenly felt a stabbing pain in his chest and had a lot of thick phlegm, so he took medicine for treatment, but it was ineffective. In the autumn, the disease became more severe, and he had fever and night sweats, so he came to me for treatment. I ordered him to rest and take "Bubhenol" internally. Jin followed my words and actions. After a month, the fever had subsided and the thick phlegm had gradually decreased. After taking it for more than two months, all the symptoms disappeared and he was as strong as before. He is now employed in a certain company. The reason why "Bubhenol" can achieve this miraculous effect is because its ingredients are pure and it is made by precise refining using scientific methods, so it is by no means accidental.</p>
<p>New Words on Gonorrhea</p>
<p>— Narrated by Dr. Yao Juyan</p>
<p>Clinic No. 9 Ningbo Road, Intersection of Sichuan Road</p>
<h3>Gonorrhea that Directly Harms Reproduction</h3>
<p>The ease with which gonorrhea affects reproductive function is inevitable for every gonorrhea patient. This kind of gonorrhea, due to the compression of reproductive function by gonorrhea, makes its tissues lose their healthy function and become the tragedy of infertility; for example, the seminal vesicle is one of the internal reproductive organs, occupying the most important part of reproduction. Patients with gonococcal seminal vesiculitis have a great relationship with reproduction. Moreover, after gonococcal seminal vesiculitis, there are also vasitis, orchitis, etc., or these symptoms may occur at the same time. It is not known, but it must be known that even if one of these symptoms is present, there is a risk of being cut off from offspring. Therefore, gonorrhea patients should try to avoid these secondary complications, that is, if they unfortunately develop these symptoms, they should also be cured as soon as possible, so as to avoid future regrets. This is the result of my honest statistics in clinical practice for 20 years. I hope that those who have gonorrhea and have not yet recovered should pay attention to it.</p>
<p>With the recent progress of medicine in the treatment of reproductive disorders caused by gonorrhea, most of the gonorrhea that causes reproductive problems can be solved and healthy reproductive function can be restored if the condition has not fallen into a very difficult situation to save. According to my experience, "Clinon", a holy medicine for gonorrhea, is the most effective internal medicine for cleaning gonorrhea, because it has the effect of anti-gonococcal bacteriophages, and it can completely remove all gonococci on the reproductive organs. On the one hand, German static electricity therapy and X-ray therapy are used interchangeably, that is, they mutually exert bactericidal effects, so that gonorrhea, which threatens reproductive function, can be completely cured. This shows the speed of scientific progress. Clinic hours: 10:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Starting today, we will send 20 patients for consultation every day. Each number only costs 5 cents.</p>

<h3>Disappointed in Love, Dance Girl Commits Suicide, Takes Poison in Hotel Room, Room Boy Discovers Her and Her Life is in Danger</h3>
<p>Zhang Lili, a young woman from Suzhou, is 19 years old. She is residing at 188 Rue Paul Beau in the French Concession and is a dance girl at the Daxin and Dahua dance halls. At about 6:00 yesterday morning, Zhang, her dancing having ended, went alone to the New Oriental Hotel on the second floor of Chu Qiaqing Road and opened room 128. She then closed the door and went to bed. At about 11:30 a.m., the day-shift waiter discovered a groaning sound in the room and immediately opened the door to look. He saw that the woman had taken poison and was lying on the bed. He summoned an ambulance to take her to Renji Hospital for treatment. Her life is in danger. After investigation, it was learned that the reason for Zhang's suicide was that she was stolen away by a dance patron.</p>
<p>It was also reported that the reporter and two friends were visiting Dahua (Avenue Edward VII) at 0:10 a.m. on the 28th. At about 4:00 a.m., just as the dance hall was closing, they suddenly heard a commotion near the auntie's room (i.e., the stairwell). All the dance girls rushed to see what was happening. The reporter immediately asked the waiter at the dance hall. According to the waiter, a dance girl named Zhang Lili dances at Daxin every evening and then continues to dance at Dahua until 4:00 a.m., when the dance hall closes and she returns home. This is her usual routine. Today (28th), when she came from Daxin, she looked very unhappy. The other dance girls asked her why she was unhappy, but she remained silent. A moment later, she went to the toilet and suddenly took out a bottle of Lysol that she had brought with her, just as she was about to open the bottle to swallow it when she was luckily spotted by Wu Feihong's mother, another dance girl, who immediately went forward and snatched the bottle away. She is currently being asked why she wanted to end her life and is being comforted. The reason for her suicide is probably nothing more than jealousy. It was not expected that the dance girl would go to the Oriental Hotel alone yesterday morning and attempt suicide again.</p>
<h3>Unable to Bear the Life of a Prostitute, Young Woman Jumps Out of the Fire Pit, Pimp Sentenced to Ten Months in Prison</h3>
<p>Zhu Genbao, a woman from Jiaxing, is 18 years old. She lived with her father, Zhu De, and mother, Shen, in their hometown. Since the outbreak of the war and the fall of Jiaxing, Zhu and her family fled to Shanghai. For a year, their lives have been difficult. On January 21st of this year, she borrowed 200 French francs from Yang Yihua, a woman from Songjiang whom she knew, at an interest rate of two percent per month, and pawned her daughter, Genbao, as collateral. Yang Yihua lives at No. 9, Lane 133, Changsha Road and is known to</p>
<p>Run a Ham Shop</p>
<p>(prostitution). She keeps many women at her house. Every night, Yang takes young women to various hotels to pick up customers. As soon as Genbao arrived at Yang's house, she was forced into prostitution. On the 20th of last month, Yang received a call from a Mr. Wang in room 321 of the China Hotel on Guizhou Road who wanted a female companion.</p>
<p>Therefore she led Zhu Genbao</p>
<p>to respond to the call. However, Genbao was originally a girl from a small family, and her chastity had not been broken. Therefore, she stated at the time that the fee for breaking her virginity was 60 yuan, but she had to stay for three nights. From then on, her reputation was tarnished and she made a living selling her body. On the 26th of this month, Zhu, unable to bear the pain, took advantage of the opportunity to escape and reported the above situation to the Old Gate Police Station. The Western police chief, Fang Teshang, and Hua Sandao Tou, No. 1013,</p>
<p>Went to Changsha Road</p>
<p>and arrested Yang Yihua, along with Yang Jubao, a 15-year-old girl from Jiaxing, and brought them to the police station. Yang was taken into custody, and Zhu Genbao and Yang Jubao were temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division 2 of the First Special Court</p>

<h3>Kidnapping of a Young Woman Forced into Marriage: Smuggler Vehemently Denies, Civil Suit for $21,000 Attached, Re-trial After Investigation Due to Seriousness of the Case</h3>
<p>Li Yongkuan, a salt smuggler who once served as the "Suppression Brigade Commander" of the puppet regime, along with his sons Li Jiaqi, Li Jiazhou, and Li Bihua, were once rampant in the Punan coastal area of Songjiang County. In the winter of the year before last, they kidnapped government officials' daughters Lin Xiuhua and Yu Yuexian in Xihétang Town, forcibly marrying them to Li Jiazhou and Li Bihua. Jiazhou killed Lin's mother, Jiang (referred to as "Big Sister" by the prisoners), and buried her in a pit. After the Nationalist Army's 62nd Division confiscated Li's firearms last spring, Li, unable to gain a foothold in his hometown, took the two women, Lin and Yu, and fled to Shanghai, residing at No. 18, Central New Village, Ciyou Road, behind the Xujiahui Catholic Church. He assigned people to guard the two women, not allowing them freedom. It was not until the morning of December 10th of last year that Lin and Yu managed to escape and sought help from the Virgin Mary Hospital of the Catholic Church. The hospital reported to the French Concession Police, and Shanghai detectives successively apprehended Li Yongkuan, Li Bihua, and Li Jiajian, and handed them over to the Special No. 2 Court for investigation. Subsequently, because the incident occurred in Songjiang, an area under Japanese occupation, there was a question of jurisdiction. The Special No. 2 Court submitted a request to the Higher Third Branch, which in turn submitted it to the Shanghai Branch of the Supreme Court to designate jurisdiction. Now, under orders, the Special No. 2 Court is still handling the case. After Judge Liao conducted an interrogation, the details were reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, another hearing was held. The victims Lin Xiuhua and Yu Yuexian, accompanied by their lawyer Xu Yanhua, arrived on time and filed a civil lawsuit, each requesting compensation of 8,000 yuan, and 500 yuan for Lin's mother's funeral expenses, and recounted the events as above. The defendants Li Yongkuan and his sons vehemently denied the kidnapping and murder. The court argued that the case was serious and required further investigation and scheduled a retrial. The defendants were returned to the detention center.</p>
<h3>The Roman-Lu Steamer Suddenly Robbed: Passengers Turn into Bandits, Cargo Looted</h3>
<p>The Roman-Lu steamer of the Dachang Shipping Company, No. 77, Jiaotong Road, Shandong Road, weighing about 100 tons, operates between Xiaochuansha, Liuhe, Yanglin, Qiya, etc., leaving port at 6:00 AM every morning and returning to Shanghai in the evening. Business is fairly good. At 6:00 AM on the day before yesterday (the 28th), the ship left Shanghai as usual, loaded with cargo and passengers, to load and unload goods and passengers at the above locations. In the afternoon, it loaded more than 1,000 pieces of cargo and over 100 passengers destined for Shanghai. At 3:30 PM,</p>
<p>Arriving at Xiaochuansha,</p>
<p>Cargo and passengers were unloaded as usual.

They then seized control of the engine room and the bridge, etc. One bandit took over as pilot and steered towards Panjiahe, near Wusongkou. The remaining bandits entered the cabins and robbed each of the passengers. At 6:30 PM, they arrived far from that location. The bandits had prepared six bandit boats in advance, which immediately approached the steamer. They looted the textiles and raw materials loaded on the steamer onto the bandit boats, completing the operation at 1:55 AM. The bandits then also</p>
<p>Jumped onto the Bandit Boats</p>
<p>and left. The ship's owner, due to the late hour, the presence of many hidden sandbars, and unfamiliarity with the route, feared running aground and waited there until dawn before setting sail back to Shanghai. When it arrived at the port it was already 8 o'clock. Upon inspection, it was found that 231 pieces of textile raw materials had been looted. Among the passengers, the greatest loss was reported by a woman from Liuhe who was returning home from Hankou after visiting relatives and was carrying more than 600 yuan in cash and jewelry, all of which was looted. The woman lamented incessantly and, when entering Wusongkou yesterday morning,</p>
<p>Attempted Suicide by Drowning,</p>
<p>But was stopped by other passengers and comforted, thus averting a tragedy. After the ship arrived at the port, the crew reported to the company. According to the company, the total loss was estimated to be over 12,000 yuan, and the matter has been reported to the Water Police Station, requesting apprehension. The ship is still operating as usual on its original route this morning.</p>

<h3>Eating and Culture</h3>
<p>— Na Jue</p>
<p>Our nation can be said to be a "nation of food lovers." When friends meet, the first greeting is often "Have you eaten?" Just like Westerners say "Good morning" or "Hello" when they meet. When family and friends communicate, they also habitually wish each other to "eat more." The ancient book says, "The people regard food as heaven," which is enough to represent the entire political thought of a food-loving nation.</p>
<p>So what is the reason why our nation loves to eat? Everyone knows that we have been an agricultural country for thousands of years. Most of the products in the countryside are food. The actual living conditions of farmers are really too poor. The only enjoyment for farmers is eating and drinking; other happiness, because they have no money to enjoy, this kind of life has passed for thousands of years, of course it has become a habit, making the art of eating specially developed in our country, while everything else is more backward than others. Although European and American culture has made amazing progress, when it comes to the art of eating, they still retain the primitive human style of using knives and forks. Compared with our nation that uses chopsticks, their skills are much more backward.</p>
<p>Eating well has become the only activity goal of our nation; therefore, weddings and celebrations must "clean the wine bottles and wait for the light," even funerals and condolences must involve eating and drinking, eating well is the entirety of our lives.</p>
<p>That's right, eating is the basic requirement of human life; but the life of civilized humans is not something that eating can encompass entirely; in addition to eating, there should also be requirements and enjoyment of clothing, housing, transportation, entertainment, and education.</p>
<p>Therefore, the level of cultural standard of a nation, it is said, can be measured by the percentage of eating expenses in the average living expenses of the people. The more developed the culture, the lower the percentage of food consumption in the total living expenses; the food expenses of European and American working-class families only account for 30% of the total living expenses. However, the food expenses of the Indian people (including flour, vegetables, etc.) account for 94% of the living expenses, and only 6% is used for clothing, medicine, and all other miscellaneous expenses. Our country does not have accurate statistics, but the living conditions of most farmers are actually not richer than those of Indians; even the living expenses of people in cities have more than 50% spent on eating.</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Housing</h3>
<p>— (Chan)</p>
<p>Mussolini can be said to be an influential figure on the international stage in recent years. But it is really a bit unbelievable; although he is the Prime Minister of Italy, his weekly salary is only six pounds, which is out of his own hope. Of course, many people will think, how can this mere six pounds be enough for him, his wife and five children to spend a week? However, his daily life is still very comfortable. Among the four items of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, just in terms of the "housing" item, his private residence is very magnificent. Maybe some people don't understand, but to say it is very ordinary. It turns out that his expenses as Prime Minister are all paid by the government, and because his salary is so small, no one has ever borrowed money from him.</p>
<p>A few years ago, a fan of him gave him a magnificent house, and another furniture dealer decorated the house for him for free. The Italian Art Museum specially sent him pictures to decorate the walls. Automobile manufacturers also insisted that he accept the gift of the latest car, and the merchants? Gave him many daily necessities. They are unwilling to accept a penny. In short, the sofas, chairs, dining tables, desks, and even knives, forks, pencils, etc. in his home, nothing was bought with money.</p>
<h3>Their Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</h3>
<p>— Wu Yun</p>
<h3>Han Cart</h3>
<p>— Li Shaonian</p>
<p>The Han cart is a kind of transportation tool, and it is most easily seen in Suiyuan. Its style is similar to that of ordinary mule carts, but it is not as large as mule carts. Its structure is also different from mule carts. Most ordinary mule carts have two rotating wheels, while the Han cart has the axle rotating together with the wheels. This is because the entire cart is made of wood, and the axle and wheels are nailed together.</p>
<p>Han carts are all pulled by cattle. Because cattle walk slowly, the cart can move forward steadily. If donkeys or mules are used to pull it, it will definitely be problematic. Because the cart body and the axle are only fixed by two pieces of wood sandwiching the axle in the middle, the cart is mostly used for transporting grain. Because sitting on it is dangerous, it is never done; if the cart travels too fast, it will inevitably "lose the axle" (meaning the axle is separated from the wheels and the cart body). However, due to economic constraints, the locals have to use this kind of cart, and this is really because its manufacturing method is too simple and the price is too cheap.</p>
<p>The wheels of the Han cart also have no spokes, but are just a round wheel made up of several wooden boards. The cart body also has no canopy, but only a few wooden poles on both sides and the back that form small railings; some are also nailed with wooden boards on top.</p>
<p>Even so, it still occupies a very high position in Suiyuan, because the people there live a hard life and really cannot afford good carts, so today, the Han cart is still the main means of transportation for the people.</p>
<h3>Economical Apartments</h3>
<p>— Zhou Zi</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the residential housing, apart from the so-called Western-style houses, the ordinary so-called grand houses are always the same. There is always a courtyard in front, a living room in the middle, and a kitchen in the back, with a small courtyard attached that is not really functional. Although these houses are usually facing south, firstly, because the lanes are narrow, and secondly, in reality, only the front part of the living room faces south, and only the front half of the living room upstairs can get sunlight. So in reality, only one-third of a house can get sunlight and air circulation. The other two-thirds can be said to be cool in winter and warm in summer, and are always stuffy and cold. Living in them, the degree of unsanitariness is not difficult to imagine.</p>
<p>Originally, the construction of this kind of lane house, one up and one down, is only suitable for a small family to live in. The living room upstairs is used as a bedroom. The pavilion upstairs is used as a study and for relatives to stay. The front living room is used for eating and resting, and the back of the living room is used for the maid to rest. Naturally, it is enough. But let me ask, in Shanghai, how many families have the economic ability to live in one up and one down? Although this type of house may have been suitable for the needs of society when it first became popular, the social economy has undergone drastic changes in the past few decades, and the general type of lane house is still the same. As a result, in one house, there are second landlords and third tenants, crowded like a big hot pot. The noise is constant all day long. Even if we put aside the hygiene problem, at the very least, the fact that this kind of outdated lane house is not suitable for today's society is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the most suitable housing is, I think, none other than apartments. Each room is isolated from each other, and each room has its own use. It is both hygienic and practical. But in today's Shanghai, although there are many apartments, most of them are only rented to Westerners. Even those that are rented to Chinese people are aristocratic, making those who live on salaries flinch. Because all the existing so-called apartments can be said to be exactly the same as those occupied by Westerners, there is absolutely no hint of populism——therefore, I have the idea of designing and constructing economical apartments that are suitable for Chinese society and replace the existing lane houses, which are suitable for middle-class small families to live in.</p>
<p>My plan for economical apartments is based on the "room" as a unit. Each room is standardized with a width of 15 feet and a depth of 20 feet. In a large room, there is a "small room." The small room is 8 feet in depth and width. The large room is a bedroom, and the small room is used for sitting and dining. This one large room and one small room can accommodate a small family. Combining four or five rooms into a small group, a public kitchen, a public toilet, a public servant's bedroom (several servants share one room), and a public laundry room can be set up. Then combine several small groups into a large group, equivalent to today's lane.</p>
<p>The structure of this kind of house, in terms of hygiene, because the bedrooms all face south, the sunlight is sufficient, and if flowers and trees are planted along the lane in lanes that are 10 to 15 feet wide, the air can be more fresh. The toilet, kitchen, and bedroom are separated by a corridor, which is naturally more beneficial to the hygiene problem.</p>
<p>Every small family rents a room, and in ordinary homes, they can no longer feel the pain of having no room to move around. Because the toilet, kitchen, laundry room, etc., each has its own public special room. In fact, there can be no difficulties or inconveniences. When several small groups are combined into a large group, or a neighborhood, there can be facilities such as a hall and a reception room, which seems to be more complete than the existing lane houses.</p>
<p>As for the price of the house, it may be slightly higher than the current lane houses. However, based on the original status of one up and one down, according to this design, it can accommodate two small families to live in. Compared with those who originally lived alone in a house, it can save a lot of economic expenditure. At the same time, renters can also avoid a lot of disputes between the second landlord and the third tenant. Therefore, this type of economic apartment-style rental, which takes the "room" as a unit, in fact, there is no existence of the terms "second landlord" and "third tenant."</p>
<h3>A Week's Economic Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>Last week, I introduced a delicious dish with fermented grains, fermented braised pork belly, which made me think of other fermented grain dishes as well. They are similarly delicious and can increase one's appetite. For example, fermented white chicken, fermented white duck, and fermented white pork are sold every summer in places like Lu Gaojian and Pu Wufang. Ziyang Temple also has fermented alligator and fermented fermented bean curd. These fermented dishes are light and not greasy, making them suitable as side dishes for wine or porridge in the summer. As for home-style dishes, how about introducing fermented green fish and fermented pig intestine soup? During the Chinese New Year in winter, buy a green fish, cut it into pieces, marinate it thoroughly with fermented grains, add some salt, and place it in a small pot with a tight lid. Take it out in early spring, braise it in red sauce, and add some auxiliary ingredients like mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and wood ear. It will be very delicious. As for the fermented intestine soup, you can buy a set of pig intestines and wash them thoroughly inside and out. Then add fermented grain juice and bamboo shoots, meat slices, etc., and simmer them together in white broth. You can add more soup and use it to soak rice, which is also very refreshing.</p>

<h3>Wu Zhihui Talks About Women's Clothing</h3>
<p>— (Boqi moves to offer aid to disaster relief)</p>
<p>At the Wenyuan Spring Banquet two years ago, many contemporary figures gathered, and I was honored to be among them, getting to know photography pioneer Lang Jingshan, old calligrapher and painter Ma Gongyu, and Central Committee member Wu Zhihui, among other celebrities. During the banquet, the topic of women's clothing came up. Mr. Zhihui launched into a lengthy discussion, saying that old Western women's clothing was shaped like the letter "K," while ancient Chinese women's clothing was shaped like the letter "A." As for the modern Chinese short-sleeved, figure-hugging, cicada-wing cheongsam, the body's curves are fully revealed, looking like the Chinese character "容" (appearance). He believes that during this period of vigorous construction, men and women should jointly engage in production, so women's clothing should also be the same as men's, using simple and convenient Zhongshan suits, which is in line with the needs of the times.</p>
<h3>Raw Materials for Artificial Cotton Wool</h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wosheng</p>
<p>After returning from West Lake to my hometown, I recuperated on the lake. I was hired by the Zhejiang Provincial Government for reconstruction to serve as a special commissioner for the design of improved paper materials. I then tried alkaline bleaching of various tree barks and grass stems in Zhejiang Province and discovered a kind of hemp material whose luster was as good as artificial silk. Therefore, I advocated that the raw materials for artificial silk do not have to use foreign wood pulp, but can use this material. It can also be used to make artificial cotton and artificial wool fleece. It does not need to be converted into liquid and can be directly processed by the digesters and beaters of paper mills to create textile fibers. However, the intermediate drying process is not suitable for papermaking machinery and must be carried out using the drying room equipment of magnesium factories to keep it loose and not clumped. Then, cotton can be made using the opening and carding machines of spinning mills, and then spun into yarn, silk thread, or fleece thread, as desired. Because its manufacturing method can be divided into two types: those made with sodium are strong and lustrous, like ordinary artificial silk; those made with potassium are soft and warming. Moreover, Zhejiang Province is rich in tong alkali, which can be combined with lime to produce "caustic potash" and "calcium carbonate," which is cheaper than buying "caustic soda." As for bleaching agents, bleaching powder can be combined with tong alkali to produce "potassium hypochlorite," and its byproduct is also calcium carbonate, which can be used for toothpaste, tooth powder, and rubber products. However, the equipment costs are quite high, so although I had this plan, I was unable to implement it. In March of the Dingchou year, the newly appointed Director of Construction, Mr. Wang Wenbo, saw that the artificial cotton made by an American named Mr. Li was of the same quality as what I made. He visited me with Mr. Li to discuss cooperation. An agreement was reached, and the machines would be shipped from his side to Hangzhou, while the raw materials would be provided by our side. It is estimated that planting on government-owned wasteland can produce four loads of hemp per mu. One person can plant five mu. Taking Qiaosi area as an example, the price sold in Xinglinping and Changan is ninety-eight catties per si ma load. There are two types: yellow hemp and green hemp. Yellow hemp is fine and tough and is commonly used for hemp silk. It is sown every October and goes on the market in early July. New goods cost eight yuan per load, and year-old goods cost twelve yuan per load. Green hemp is coarse and brittle and is commonly used for making sacks. It is sown in May and can be harvested in July and August. New goods cost only four or five yuan per load, and year-old goods cost seven or eight yuan per load. Therefore, it is advisable to specialize in planting yellow hemp. Sandy fields along the river can be planted with hemp after being cultivated with grass to reduce salinity. Each mu only needs two loads of soybean cake fertilizer, which can open up a source of profit for our Zhejiang Province. It is estimated that in no more than three to five years, we will not only be able to supply ourselves but also sell it abroad. Planting hemp is not like planting mulberry trees, as only the seeds are used, not seedlings. Special planting is easy, and harvesting is fast, so it cannot be compared to planting mulberry trees. Unfortunately, after the outbreak of the August 13th Incident, this became a pie in the sky, which is a pity. When I arrived in Zhenhu, I talked about artificial cotton with Mr. Tang Jiazhen of the Huozhong Yarn Factory, because the roving frames in his factory could easily turn cotton into rolls, making it easier to get started. Mr. Tang is a famous doctor in Shanghai. Because he was interested in absorbent cotton, he first started with the alkaline bleaching of absorbent cotton, which has been standardized. Mr. Zhao Zhiyou and Mr. Yin Zibai happened to be planning to move the factory together, so I first went to Hankou to discuss with the president of the Shanghai Bank about using hemp produced in Hubei as raw material. However, its properties are very different from those produced in Zhejiang, containing a lot of pectin, which consumes a lot of alkaline bleaching agent, and the price of hemp is twice as high as that in Zhejiang, which was quite disappointing. When I arrived in Chongqing, I was introduced by Mr. Huang Liangchen of Baoyuantong to meet Mr. Wu Hongzhe. He also had the regret of not being able to complete this artificial cotton plan. He had entrusted the Guangdong Provincial Yarn Factory to try out samples with the raw materials he made, but he still could not raise funds to proceed. Therefore, I realized that the lack of talent and money is not suitable for our China. It is the lack of wealthy people. Sichuan and Yunnan do not produce much cotton. I think that in the near future, someone will definitely think of this and do it with the strength of the government, so that the financial aspect will not be a problem. As for the manufacturing method, it is quite simple, just like any papermaking material made from tree bark and grass stems. Villagers can use manual retting to remove the pectin, and after pounding, the transportation cost can be reduced by more than two-thirds. As for the soil for planting, any land that can grow grass can be planted, which is much easier than planting cotton. Our Zhejiang produces a lot of cotton, so this may not be necessary, but in the southwest, with the increase in population, the difficulty of no clothing may be unavoidable. Then, shouldn't this plan for a rainy day be something that people should consider?</p>

<p>Education News</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Orders All Education Bureaus in War Zones to Establish Associations for Promoting Work Behind Enemy Lines, Train People from All Walks of Life to Work Behind Enemy Lines, and Organize Five-Person Groups to Return Home and Convey Strategies for Resisting the Enemy</h3>
<p>(Chongqing News) The Ministry of Education has received a letter from the Secretariat of the Supreme National Defense Council, forwarding the suggestions of the Second National Political Council regarding the promotion of universal education and the increase of anti-Japanese forces. Among them, the third measure is to establish associations for promoting work behind enemy lines, train and subsidize people with strong national consciousness and skills to work behind enemy lines. The Ministry has instructed all education bureaus in war zones to cooperate with the local military and implement it as soon as possible. The measures are excerpted as follows: (1) The personnel to be dispatched are not limited to teachers, but must have strong national consciousness. Farmers, workers, and merchants are all acceptable. (2) Local associations should promote the movement to return to one's hometown or serve in one's hometown. (3) The method of movement can be to organize five-person groups to return home. One farmer goes to farm, one worker goes to work, one merchant goes to trade, one soldier goes to teach guerrilla warfare, and one teacher goes to take charge of cultural work. The whole group of five must unite and convey national consciousness and resistance strategies to the compatriots behind enemy lines. (4) If teachers and soldiers can also farm or work, they can be self-sufficient behind enemy lines. (5) In addition to travel expenses and the minimum start-up costs, a small amount of resettlement fees should be given to those with families.</p>

<h3>Wu Zhihui Speaks on Education Issues from a Layman's Perspective (3): Strict Management is Necessary to Avoid Failure; In Times of National Crisis, Leading by Example is Essential for Frugality</h3>
<p>Although there is some close relationship between good and evil, and wisdom and foolishness, Zeng Shen was simple, Zi Lu was brave, and Zai Yu was foolish. Among foolish people, there are first-class good people who are steadfast in their actions, and among clever people like Shaozheng Mao, there are often first-class bad people who are eloquent and knowledgeable, and who are sophisticated and refined in their deceit. If the truth enters the ears of clever and good people, it will succeed in becoming the insightful understanding of the wise and prescient. It is just that Premier Sun hopes that such a preceptor with the task of "knowing what is difficult" can blow the truth into the ears of foolish and good people, so that they can also firmly believe and protect it. This is what Premier Sun hopes they will take on with the task of "doing what is easy" as those who understand and act later. It is what Confucius meant by "one can talk about higher things with people above average". If they are below average, a group of people who do not understand or are not aware, at most one can broaden their minds with literature, restrain them with ritual, and add the principles of "do not look at what is improper, do not listen to what is improper, only then can they be controlled and made to act in a certain way, and must not act otherwise. This is like the thirty-five bad people in the most prosperous country today, who can superficially abide by the law, and some clever people like Shaozheng Mao, even though people are always on guard against them, they can still become very capable and useful people. These kinds of people are what Confucius said, "Do not let them know why, but let them follow". Premier Sun is not being modest, but is naturally not deifying himself, and even allows first-class people to add to what he has said. However, if those below average, like Shaozheng Mao, are allowed to see benevolence as benevolence and wisdom as wisdom, resulting in the division of Confucianism into eight schools and Mohism into three schools, it will definitely be detrimental.</p>
<p>Nature and the Way of Heaven, Confucius rarely spoke of them, but ritual already encompasses a great deal, including all the rules for being a person and governing. Speaking of using ritual to control oneself, how easy is it? If it is self-control, there are still the principles of "do not look at what is improper, do not listen to what is improper," but the scope of control can only cover "do not act improperly, do not speak improperly," because speech and action are things that even the police can interfere with. As for sight and hearing, one can only ask people to take care of themselves; interference is not thorough. People below average can only be expected to be "two no's" officials; hoping for "four no's" gentlemen is unlikely. Therefore, what I said above about those who control others should first control themselves, even though this sentence is not about nature or the Way of Heaven, and should be said to everyone, it is actually only meant for those above average. Even for those above average, besides sages, the Great Learning still asks them to hire ten voluntary policemen to secretly monitor them, so-called "ten eyes pointing, ten hands pointing," how strict! This method of self-control cannot be called controlling others. It is definitely not enough to paste the motto of self-control all over the walls, and then "peeing here is prohibited" to dismiss the police. Therefore, people must be controlled. Save a little of the heart's blood for teaching, and spend a little of the heart's blood for control. These are just my, as a layman, prejudices about the current education issues.

<h3>West Youth Volleyball Fierce Battle: Hai Qing Overwhelms Russian Army; Two Years of Hatred Wiped Out in One Day; Women's Group Youxing Overcomes West Youth</h3>
<p>Last night, the West Youth volleyball, male and female four giants meeting, attracted countless spectators, creating an unprecedented grand occasion since the start of the competition. As a result, both the male and female Chinese teams won successively. In the women's group, Youxing won two games against West Youth by a score of 2-0. In the men's A group, Hai Qing won against the Russian army. Hai Qing had lost to the Russian army for two consecutive years, and now it has finally retaliated.</p>
<p>Youxing Wins West Youth</p>
<p>In the first game, Youxing played against West Youth. West Youth's serve was mistaken, and Youxing's Huang Xingfen scored six consecutive points. West Youth fought hard to regain one point. Youxing then took a commanding lead of nine to one. West Youth counterattacked successfully, forcing a tie at ten points each. Youxing suddenly increased by five points, winning the first set by fifteen to ten. Continuing the fight, West Youth took the lead by two points. Youxing surpassed by five to two. After seven to seven, the competition became fierce, and both sides made contributions. Youxing always led by one or two points, and finally took the second set by fifteen to eleven. In the second game, Lan Hei and St. Francis continued to fight. Lan Hei used its full strength and won two consecutive sets by fifteen to seven and fifteen to six.</p>
<p>Haiqing Wins Russian Army</p>
<p>The decisive battle between Haiqing and the Russian army unfolded, and the audience's spirits were lifted. Zheng Yiquan's spike was successful, winning the right to serve. Mai Bingyao took the lead and scored one point. After several rounds, Haiqing led by four to zero. The Russian army's Qinuofu and Dikesinisi counterattacked, chasing to four to five. Haiqing increased by seven points, while the Russian army only scored two points. However, the tension of the game did not diminish slightly due to the large difference in the score. Haiqing won the first set with a high score of fifteen to six. After changing sides, Haiqing took the lead with three to one. The score was tied twice at three and four points each. The Russian army responded calmly and took the lead with eight to four. Haiqing was unwilling to relax. Zheng and Mai's spikes and Zhang and Han's blocks made it difficult for the Russian army to cope, losing as many as seven points in a row. The Russian army called a timeout and a turning point was achieved, tying the score at eleven points each. Haiqing then created a score of fourteen to eleven. At this final juncture, Han Deshu made a mistake, and the opponent regained two points. At this time, the back and forth was wonderful, winning warm applause from the audience. Finally, Zheng Yiquan used his trump card, and the Russian army lost the second set by thirteen to fifteen. As a result, Haiqing defeated the Russian army in straight sets, wiping out two years of shame in one day. However, since the competition is a double round-robin system, there are still opportunities to meet. At that time, the Russian army will definitely seek revenge. Yesterday's results and tonight's order are as follows:</p>
<p>Youxing 15-10 15-11 West Youth (Female)</p>
<p>Lan Hei 15-7 15-6 St. Francis (B)</p>
<p>Haiqing 15-6 15-13 Russian Army (A)</p>

Its strength is exceptionally strong, having won 16 games and lost only two, winning the Kansai High School Championship, and also defeating the Kobe Foreign Grade A team, so its technical level is high.

The American Public School in this city will do its best to be a good host and entertain them. A special sports program will be held by the whole school on May 5 to welcome the team. The American Public School Sports Committee has decided to host several banquets, and on the last day, they will host a Chinese meal, watch a play, and have a dance party. The competition order has also been arranged by the American Public School. Four games will be played with the American Public School's invitation basketball tournament champion Jinan, runner-up Giant, and third-place American Public School. The first game will be on the day of arrival in Shanghai, playing against Jinan at the Baxianqiao YMCA at 8 pm.

<h3>A Letter from Li Huitang: A Decade of Vicissitudes</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) Ball King Li Huitang recently sent a letter to his friend Sang Yu, in which he fully expressed his vicissitudes of the past ten years. The writing is both literary and emotional, with many admonishing words that can serve as a lesson for football players. It is recorded below:</p>
<p>After the Sino-British International Charity Cup, I am grateful for your additional encouragement, which moved the heart of this aging, fading figure who should have been eliminated long ago, with gratitude and mixed feelings.</p>
<p>After the broken leg, I reluctantly participated in charity matches. Every time I stepped onto the grass, I was trembling with fear, as if walking on thin ice. I was always afraid of being rejected by people. Sometimes I thought of my late father's earnest advice, "Beauties have been like famous generals since ancient times; do not let people see white hair." Those two sentences made me even more vigilant and fearful. However, thanks to the spirit of my late father in heaven, I received good reviews from friends after each game. This unparalleled comfort has interrupted my determination to "wash away the lead and rouge" many times. Many friends find it surprising that a 35-year-old man has been messing around in the football circle for 20 years. Even if he is not abandoned by others, he himself should be tired of it. In fact, if I am not tired of it at this point, it is probably because I love it too deeply. Nature has endowed me with a special talent, and at the age of 35, I still feel energetic and do not offend people. Perhaps it is because the discerning eyes of society have been strictly monitoring me over the years, so that I dare not do anything illegal in the Eastern Hemisphere, and I deeply cherish my position and reputation, and strive to be careful in my behavior and cultivate myself. That's all, where does the secret come from? To be honest, I am still running around on the football field today, even I myself am a bit inexplicable, because my football life has been resurrected three times in the past ten years. The first time was in 1930, when the Lehua team went to Europe, but returned midway due to a shortage of talent. I was so angry at the inability of domestic sports organizations to cooperate sincerely that I decided to retire from then on. Later, I thought that if my great wish to travel to Europe was not fulfilled, my ambition would not rest for a day, so I returned south from Shanghai and continued to serve my mother club, South China. In the autumn of 1933, I contracted pleurisy due to excessive exercise in Batavia and was hospitalized for more than a month. I recuperated in the mountains for a hundred days. The doctor loved me deeply and repeatedly urged me not to engage in championship sports again after recovery, otherwise I would be in danger. However, in 1934, after returning to Hong Kong, I reluctantly attended the 10th Far Eastern Games for the country. The following year, that young doctor with a bright future unfortunately passed away before me, which is truly regrettable. In the summer of 1937, I followed South China to Semarang, where I had my left tendon kicked off by a half-baked player. At that time, I thought it was definitely over this time. I wrote the sentence "From now on, my football life will be over, who will judge right and wrong?" in the hospital, which shows that I was indeed determined to hang up my boots at that time. Until September last year, I raised funds for charity matches in the midst of national crisis. After several encouragements from friends, I became a "Feng Fu" again, and until now, I just want to do my duty as a citizen and do a little work in the rear. These three things mentioned above have endless aftertastes in each of my recollections.</p>
<p>Looking at it from the perspective of our country's sports organizations, this strange phenomenon is not worthy of praise or joy. "New waves on the Yangtze River push the old waves forward." People like us from the past should have withdrawn from the road to the virtuous long ago, but "if the new waves do not push forward, where can we wait for talents?" The fact that our sports are far behind is not without reason. In this transitional period when we are all working together to advance, it is no less than a great regret.</p>
<h3>Tiger Roar Football Team vs. Jin Ke</h3>
<p>Yang Xuezhi, the president of the Tiger Roar Athletic Association, has been enthusiastic about promoting sports in recent years. Ling Yi, the instructor of the association, has also achieved remarkable results. For the sake of mutual improvement, the association's football team is scheduled to play a friendly match against the Jin Ke Middle School football team at the Jin Ke Middle School stadium at 4:30 PM today.</p>

<h3>The Victory Perspective of Defensive Warfare</h3>
<p>— Mao Lie</p>
<p>For example, if a robber wants to break into your house, you close all the doors and windows tightly, and the walls are strong. The robber can do nothing. This is certainly the robber's failure. The robber's failure is certainly your victory. Therefore, in the three-month Battle of Shanghai, the enemy has always been confined to a corner and unable to go deep. We can view it this way and consider it a victory for our defensive warfare.</p>
<p>If the robber finally breaks into your house, of course, it is his victory and your failure. However, his victory at this time cannot cover up his past failures, and your failure today cannot erase your past victories. Therefore, the retreat of the National Army from Shanghai can simply be regarded as a successful retreat.</p>
<p>However, this is still a temporary and local, small-scale view. Suppose the robber has only entered your front house or side wing, and you are still guarding your back hall and inner room, and you are still fighting with him, then you cannot be considered a failure at all, and he cannot be considered a victory. On the contrary, it can even be said that you are victorious and he is defeated, because your defensive power has not been lost, and his attack has not been effective after all. Therefore, after the fall of Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, and Guangzhou fell one after another in the past 20 months. As long as we are still fighting until now, we are still in a state of victory, and the enemy is in a state of failure. As for the future, we will eventually be able to drive the enemy out of the country, just as you will eventually be able to drive the robber out of the house. Needless to say, that will be our complete victory and the enemy's great defeat. Some small ins and outs before this are even more insignificant.</p>
<p>In short, as long as a defensive war can be defended firmly, it is a victory; in an offensive war, if the attack cannot go in and the enemy cannot be reduced, even if the entire army retreats, it is a failure. Now, our defensive power is only getting stronger and stronger as we fight, and the enemy's offensive power is only getting weaker and weaker as we fight. Although we are still inevitably retreating from our troops and losing land, we are indeed in a state of victory, and the enemy is indeed in a state of failure.</p>
<p>I am not arguing sophistically, nor am I trying to comfort myself in the midst of the Nanchang street fighting. I believe that I have something to see and say. People with reason and self-confidence will always agree with my view.</p>
<p>If we have indeed failed, we should still rise up and fight to the end; now that we have suffered minor setbacks, but we have clearly not failed, and we are still victorious, then how should we rejoice and encourage ourselves to achieve our ultimate goal and drive out our enemies?</p>
<h3>Grandma Enters the City (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Ming Zhi</p>
<p>"It seems like I won't suffer a loss this way," she said with a smile.</p>
<p>At this time, Wang Mingyuan and his group had to admit that Grandma had the ability. Grandma's son and daughter-in-law also felt that the danger seemed to be reduced a lot in this way, and they felt more at ease, so they no longer stopped her.</p>
<p>However, it became difficult to take out the weapons and leaflets when they were rich. Because there were so many things, there were 12 weapons and a large bundle of leaflets. Grandma could not carry them all in by herself. If she only brought as much as possible, she was afraid that there would not be enough inside, which would delay the important task. Wang Mingyuan hesitated again because of this.</p>
<p>"I have a way," Grandma thought for a while and said, "Aren't there three of the four city gates still open? I will go in and out of these three city gates three times."</p>
<p>Due to her arrangement, this method was decided: her son carried a load of firewood, with those things placed inside, and sent her to a large cemetery three miles away from the east city, where he brought one-third of them in for her. Then, he brought them in batches to her three miles outside the south gate and the west gate. According to her estimate, she would be able to do it all in one day.</p>
<p>Her son was originally not very worried, but now that he was asked to do this, he was happy to agree. Because he thought that at least he could get news of his mother earlier and not be anxious at home.</p>
<p>"Grandma, I wish you success!"</p>
<p>Grandma and her son left their home in the midst of the blessings of Wang Mingyuan and his group.</p>
<p>As they walked, they stopped when they reached the large cemetery and saw that no one was coming and going. Grandma tied four Mauser pistols to her thighs and calves with tattered pieces of cloth, and tied a bundle of leaflets to her arms. Then, she picked up a bamboo stick and a broken basket, and agreed with her son on the place to meet outside the south gate, and parted ways.</p>
<p>She begged as she carried out her mission. Especially after crossing the drawbridge and getting closer to entering the city, although she knew that she would be scolded by many people, she begged from house to house. Occasionally, someone gave her a copper coin or some leftovers. She accepted it frankly and ate it with gratitude. The guards at the city gate were not blind and had already seen her.</p>
<p>When she begged to the city gate, she folded her hands and bowed to the yellow-uniformed man guarding the gate, and muttered:</p>
<p>"Thank you, good sir, for letting me go in and get something to eat. I'm really starving."</p>
<p>"Go, go, go!" the yellow-uniformed man scolded angrily.</p>
<p>She saw that the yellow-uniformed man did not necessarily forbid her from entering, and meant that he just wanted her to stay away from him. So she bowed and muttered, turned her back to the city, and stepped in.</p>
<p>As soon as she entered the city, she continued to beg from house to house within the sight of the yellow-uniformed man. When she turned the corner, she stopped begging and went straight to Wang Mingyuan and the place she had told him.</p>
<p>She met the other group of people, handed them the things she had brought, and said what she needed to say. Then, she walked towards the street leading out of the city. She still went out of the east gate, but this time she no longer begged, but just walked slowly. When she passed the yellow-uniformed man, she bowed to him again and muttered:</p>
<p>"Thank you, good sir, for letting me go in and have a full meal."</p>
<p>The yellow-uniformed man ignored her.</p>
<p>As soon as she crossed the drawbridge and turned the corner, she hurried south.</p>
<p>She went in and out of the city gates three times in one day. Her mission was completed. In the evening, she and her son returned to their home together.</p>
<p>"Grandma, you've worked hard!" Wang Mingyuan said as he greeted her as soon as he saw her.</p>
<p>"Grandma is really brave!" Everyone praised her in this way.</p>
<p>"This is nothing compared to your fighting," Grandma said politely.</p>
<p>The next night, this group of people and other groups from other places easily attacked the city. Because there were only one or two hundred yellow-uniformed men in the city, and another group of people in the city was responding, the yellow-uniformed men did not know the truth. Those who valued their lives rushed out of the north gate and fled to a large town 30 miles away to join the rest of the yellow-uniformed men.</p>
<p>In the morning, the city was covered with anti-Japanese leaflets. "The Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth" flew in the bright sunshine.</p>
<p>In the evening, the various groups of people returned to their respective bases with spoils of war.</p>
<p>"Grandma," Wang Mingyuan said as soon as he saw Grandma, "This time the credit goes to you."</p>
<p>"That's not true."</p>
<p>"But tonight we will move to another place. We will come and bother you again after a while."</p>
<p>This group of people left, and the story of Grandma entering the city spread everywhere.</p>
<h3>Retribution</h3>
<p>— He Han</p>
<h3>How to Apply New Realism</h3>
<p>— Yang Jinhao</p>
<p>The writing activities of wartime literature and art are multifaceted—whether it is romanticism or realism, as long as the theme is focused on the war of resistance and nation-building, we need it. However, we must continue to request for the past two or three years that writers step up the implementation of new realism writing methods, because it is the writing route that can best reveal the essence of reality and show the development of reality.</p>
<p>Regarding the writing method of new realism, A. Fadeyev explained it very clearly in his speech "On the Methodology of Creation", which quoted a passage from his essay "Down with Schiller". Although it was addressed to Soviet Pro writers, it also applies to our country's wartime literary and art writers under oppression and aggression. He said:</p>
<p>"First, the avant-garde artist does not take the path of romanticism, that is, does not take the path of mystifying reality, the path of designing heroic personalities as 'phonographs of the spirit of the times', the path of 'hypocrisy that makes us uplifted', but the path of 'stripping off all masks' from reality in the most thorough, decisive, and unforgiving way.</p>
<p>"Second, the avant-garde artist does not take the path of crude realism. He must 'get rid of innate prejudices' and give the clearest scenes of life from the 'most superficial visibility of things', that is, to be able to prove the dialectic of reality from the 'spots of contingency' to the greatest extent possible.</p>
<p>"Third, unlike the great realists of the past, the artist must see the process of social development and the various fundamental forces that promote this process and determine this development; that is, he must express the birth of the new in the old, the birth of the tomorrow in today, and the struggle and victory of the new over the old. This means that the artist not only explains the world, but also consciously serves the work of transforming the world more than any artist in the past."</p>
<p>Of course, we do not advocate Soviet literature now. On the contrary, the Chinese proletariat cannot seek liberation unless it carries out the struggle for national liberation, and socialist literature must be united into the torrent of wartime literature and art. Wartime literature and art is the literature and art of the oppressed and invaded nations seeking liberation. It is the most progressive literature and art that explores the truth; undoubtedly, it needs to "strip off all masks from reality", "prove the dialectic of reality from the 'spots of contingency'", "and consciously serve the work of transforming the world."</p>
<p>However, it is not enough to understand the principles of this theory. It is better to practice and concretize it. Therefore,</p>
<p>First, writers should go deep into the real life of the war of resistance and nation-building, participate in this struggle, investigate this struggle, experience this struggle, and look forward to this struggle. From that very rich world of phenomena, they should discard the non-essential, vulgar, superficial, and accidental things that will disappear immediately, and abstract the essential, typical, universal, and objectively necessary things.</p>
<p>Second, writers must thoroughly understand the theory of war of resistance and nation-building, and flexibly use dynamic logic to understand the nature, process, and future of this war of resistance, the inevitable dynamics in the domestic and international aspects of its development, and how to deal with them and strive for the final victory of war of resistance and nation-building.</p>
<p>Third, writers must constantly join the ranks of the masses, and in the common practice of war of resistance and nation-building, be indignant, strive, grieve, be happy, and make progress with the masses. They should forge their own personality into the commonality of the masses in the crucible of the masses, and then sharply render that universal and consistent feeling from the tip of their pens!</p>
<p>To date, literary and artistic products that foreshadow the future, guide life, educate, and encourage struggle are extremely needed, but not enough. Here, in addition to hoping that the already established writers will step up the implementation of new realism writing methods, we also hope that new writers with rich life experience will rise up to expand and promote the writing activities of wartime literature and art!</p>

<h3>In the Flames of War</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>After finishing speaking, he stood at attention again and gave the most solemn salute to the corpse of Mayor Chen. Everyone followed suit, bowing their heads to express silent mourning.</p>
<p>Regimental Commander Ye called over a few servants and ordered them to drag the corpses of the Japanese officer, the propaganda team leader, and One-Eyed Li to the wilderness among the graves to dig a pit and bury them. As for the corpse of Mayor Chen, they wrapped his head and carried it back to his private residence, preparing to hold a public funeral for him and his daughter Xiuyue at the same time the next day.</p>
<p>Hepu Town was recaptured. The people who had retreated with the army or fled to other safe areas when the town was lost returned to their hometowns one after another, all with mixed feelings of grief and joy. They all suffered some losses, large or small. Some houses were bombed or burned down. Although some houses survived, none of the belongings inside were left. However, being able to keep the whole family safe and sound was already considered great luck in misfortune. As for those who had unfortunately lost their loved ones in this disaster, on this day of regaining freedom, they thought of the people who had been laughing and talking with them not long ago, but now they were separated by a world and could never see each other again. They could not help but burst into sorrow at the same time. Among them, Doctor Jin Chunan was especially heartbroken. When he thought of his beautiful wife, who was always by his side, had died at the hands of the Japanese army, he hated the Japanese army to the bone. Because of his hatred for the Japanese army, he specially ran to Regimental Commander Ye and asked him to shoot all the prisoners, or at least let him kill ten or so with his own hands to vent his anger and avenge his wife.</p>
<p>Regimental Commander Ye did not agree to his request. He explained the importance of treating prisoners of war favorably to Jin Chunan very sincerely:</p>
<p>"We must treat prisoners of war favorably, because this is not only the morality that soldiers should have in wartime, but also because we can interrogate the enemy's situation from the prisoners and do the work of disintegrating the enemy's army. We must know that what is worth hating is the enemy's warlords, not the enemy's individual soldiers. If we kill prisoners of war at will, we will fall into inhumanity and violate the original intention of this war of resistance being a righteous war."</p>
<p>Jin Chunan walked away sullenly. Judging from his appearance, he seemed very dissatisfied. Regimental Commander Ye did not pay attention to him. He wrote a letter home and asked a boatman to go to Taihu Lake to find Mr. Ye and Mrs. Ye. In the letter, in addition to reporting the news that Hepu Town had been recaptured, he also told them that the houses in their home had been burned to the ground and asked them not to return for the time being if they could settle down there.</p>
<p>The next day was a very important day in Hepu Town. Not only was a public funeral held for Mayor Chen and Xiuyue, but also because it happened to be Monday, a memorial week was held at the same time, summoning all the people and troops to give a speech. Early in the morning, many people came to the square to gather. Regimental Commander Ye had already stood in the middle of the square in military uniform and sword. His expression was very serious. Before long, amid the loud fanfare of the military band, several servants carried the coffins of Mayor Chen and Xiuyue to the middle of the square, and the coffins were covered with national flags. Regimental Commander Ye led all the people and soldiers to give the most solemn salute to the coffins, briefly reported the circumstances of Mayor Chen and Xiuyue's death, and finally said: (46)</p>

<h3>MGM's Shanghai Representative Talks About the Tendencies of Shanghai Movie Audiences</h3>
<p>— Stupid Child</p>
<p>— The Most Important Thing is the Action of the Stars</p>
<p>A spokesperson for MGM's Shanghai office recently made a statement to a reporter from the Mainland News, describing the tendencies of Shanghai movie audiences towards the company's films and stars. Because what he pointed out was quite insightful, I have translated the spokesperson's remarks below to inform the readers of the "Entertainment Circle":</p>
<p>"The most important thing that general Chinese movie audiences value in American stars is action. Perhaps the only reason is that action is the easiest to understand in a movie. Even people who do not understand English dialogue can understand the plot of the whole movie by watching the actors' actions," the spokesperson said.</p>
<p>"For example, Chinese movie audiences are very fond of musical comedies," the spokesperson continued. "The structure of such films is usually very simple. In addition to a lot of music, the scenery is quite peculiar and magnificent."</p>
<p>"However, you will never know when these films are released," he said. "Sometimes the crowding of the audience will surprise you. For example, 'Marie Antoinette' has a certain tendency. This production does not have much moving action in the whole film. After we finished filming, we were worried that this film would not be as popular in China as it was in the United States. However, when it was released, Chinese audiences rushed to it."</p>
<p>"Perhaps this film is so popular because Chinese movie audiences worship Norma Shearer, at least in part. There is also a reason why Chinese people like Norma Shearer. Her thinness and beauty are completely in line with the ideal of beauty in Chinese people's minds," he said.</p>
<p>He also said that among MGM's female stars, besides Norma Shearer, the most popular among Chinese people is Jeanette MacDonald. Among the male stars, Clark Gable is the number one. Since 1931, MGM's productions have been rented and shown in Shanghai every year, about 40 to 45 films. The same is true for Hong Kong and Tianjin.</p>
<p>American films are distributed all over the world. Subtitles are used to explain them in countries where English is not spoken. And if there are some countries that prohibit listening to English, then the dialogue is recorded in another language. This matter can sometimes make you feel very complicated, especially songs.</p>
<p>Light comedies, historical stories, and what people generally call "family movies" are the focus of MGM's productions in 1938. Regarding whether great operas will be introduced to the screen in the future, according to the spokesperson, Hollywood producers are still hesitating. Because the only purpose of film companies is to make money, and it is not certain whether such films will be popular among American audiences. Shanghai is even different. There may not be many people who like to watch such films. In short, the money spent by film companies still has to be recovered from the audience.</p>
<h3>Distinctions in Peking Opera Ancient Costumes</h3>
<p>— Chan Weng</p>
<p>In Peking Opera, female costumes are placed in two costume trunks backstage. Whether they are female robes, female capes, female official attire, or palace costumes, they are used uniformly regardless of the Han, Tang, Yuan, or Ming dynasties. Since Mei Lanfang emerged, he created separate ancient costumes, which many imitated. However, Lanfang's ancient costumes were suitable for ancient costume dramas, with each drama having its own style and each character having their own identity. For example, the attire of "Daiyu Burying Flowers" cannot be used in the play "Lady Shangyuan."</p>
<p>According to the playwright Qi Rushan, Lanfang created more than fifty kinds of ancient costumes. "Daiyu Burying Flowers" used "Spring Chamber Clothes," "Flower Burial Clothes," and "Dusting Moss Clothes"; "Chang'e Flying to the Moon" used "Flower Picking Clothes" and "Immortal Banquet Clothes"; "Celestial Maiden Scattering Flowers" used "Heavenly Palace Clothes," "Cloud Road Clothes," and "Cloud Platform Clothes"; "Magu Presenting Longevity" used "Cave Clothes," "Medicine Picking Clothes," and "Longevity Clothes"; "Hongxian Stealing the Box" used "Flying Clothes"; Lady Shangyuan used "Heavenly Clothes," "Cheng Hua Clothes," and "Spiritual True Clothes"; Farewell My Concubine used "Tent Clothes," "Chu Banquet Clothes," and "Dance Creation Clothes"; Xi Shi used "Silk Washing Clothes," "Leaving the Country Clothes," and "Feather Dance Clothes," "Corridor Clothes," "Returning to the Country Clothes," and "Lake Touring Clothes"; The True Story of Taizhen used "Entering the Palace Clothes," "Golden Crow Clothes," "Leisure Residence Clothes," "Moon Palace Clothes," "Palace Clothes," "Dance Plate Clothes," "Love Pledge Clothes," "Rainbow Clothes," "Turning Clothes," and "Yu Zhen Clothes." Other plays such as Lian Jin Feng, Goddess of the Luo River, Qingwen Mending the Fur, and Mulan Joining the Army should also have specially made clothes.</p>
<p>I believe that the ancient costumes created by Lanfang have opened up a new path in the theatrical world. It is a pity that the costumes of various dramas are mostly similar, and the above-mentioned names of ancient costumes are named according to the drama. When the audience watches them, they only find the patterns novel, but the styles are still similar. Over the past two thousand years in China, ancient costumes can be found in the records of clothing and carriages of various dynasties, scattered in inscriptions on bells and tripods, bronze wares, and old surviving paintings, which are numerous. If we can refer to them and further innovate, it will indeed add a unique brilliance to the theatrical world.</p>
<h3>Musical Instruments Used in Storytelling</h3>
<p>— Yu Xiu</p>
<p>The musical instruments used in storytelling are very simple. A "single performer" only uses a stringed instrument; even a "double act" only adds a pipa for the assistant to use. Although some people used dulcimers some time ago, singing what they called "yangqin openings" to attract attention, they ultimately disappeared like a flash in the pan and did not last. This is the same as using a huqin for "clerical openings" now, which is just a "gimmick."</p>
<p>The first step in learning to sing storytelling is "learning the instruments"—studying the stringed instrument and the pipa. Although the stringed instrument and the pipa are not considered particularly difficult to learn among musical instruments, one still needs to have a musical talent. Those with this talent will find it interesting to learn and can achieve twice the result with half the effort; otherwise, they will only "bump" and "thump" for the rest of their lives, never being able to find the right tune. The stringed instrument is simpler than the pipa, but it is easy to learn but difficult to master, while the pipa is the opposite. Therefore, there are few who are proficient in the stringed instrument but more who are proficient in the pipa.</p>
<p>Tuning the stringed instrument is about balancing strength and gentleness, speed and slowness, all being in rhythm and in sync, flowing smoothly, clearly, and resonantly. Usually, during the "singing," it is intermittent to avoid the string sounds interfering with the lyrics. Even during "transitions," it is best to play sparingly; playing more than singing is most likely to invite the audience's disgust. Playing the pipa is about skillful and fluid finger techniques, with each note clear and distinct amidst inflections and nuances. When playing in harmony with the stringed instrument, it should be consistently harmonious, tightly coordinated, and in sync, forming a unified whole, allowing the audience to experience a sense of beauty in the harmonious notes. It is imperative to avoid the pipa and stringed instrument each playing their own way, or even competing for dominance, failing to cooperate, which will inevitably lead to fragmentation and mutual harm.</p>
<p>Among the current masters of the sanxian, Wei Yuqing is the most highly regarded. His posture holding the instrument is both stylish and pleasing, and he plays with ease and control. Among the younger generation, only Zhong Xiaonong can faintly imitate him, with some merit. As for the others, there is no need to discuss them. As for Xu Yunzhi's "copper-stringed instrument," connoisseurs praise it as the "trickster" of the sanxian, with a sound that is indeed much louder than ordinary stringed instruments. However, there is no "iron throat" in the world that can accompany its sound, so the "singing" inevitably ends up being overshadowed by the "copper strings," leading to criticism that the singing cannot surpass the playing, and the playing and singing are separated. However, it has become a style of its own and is quite popular in Shanghai, with Yan Xueting, Xing Ruiting, and others being its devotees, mostly Xu's top students. After the passing of "Pipa King" Zhang Buchan, his son, Shaochan, with his family's scholarly background, dominates the stage. On the third, sixth, and ninth days of the month, he puts up a large "pipa suite" sign to attract attention, which often sells out the venue. For ensemble of stringed instrument and pipa, the team of Shen Xue and Jiang Zhu is considered the best, a perfect match, achieving the utmost beauty, and is extremely popular with the audience.</p>
<p>In addition, storytelling artists such as Huang Zhaolin, Tian Yiliang, and Mo Tianhong all know how to play the pipa. Tian and Huang only occasionally "switch" during "assembly books," while Mo often uses a large "pipa suite" to attract attention even during ordinary times. Because Mo studied under Jin Xiaodi, and Jin's father, Gui Ting, was in the business of singing with the luojin fan and was skilled in musical instruments, Mo indirectly received Jin Guiting's mantle from Xiaodi. Therefore, he can use the "pipa suite" as an extra gift from Jintai to generously entertain the audience, it is said.</p>

<h3>Secret History of the Palace and Theatrical World of the Old Capital (133)</h3>
<p>— Xu Muyun</p>
<p>The Main Reason for Releasing Cao at Huarong Trail</p>
<p>From a positive perspective, this could give Yun Chang a reputation for loyalty. According to Kongming's private thoughts, the author is as accurate as a god; today there is proof of that. Although you lost your head, it was preserved by your elder brother, but in the future, you will have a handle in the author's hands, so why should you not obey my command? The above is the reason why Kongming knew Guan Gong would release Cao, but he deliberately let him go.</p>
<p>This article once said that the ancients valued name and position and were cautious about their origins. These two sentences are the main reason for Kongming releasing Cao at Huarong Trail. Imagine, if Cao Cao was really captured at this time, would Zhuge Liang have been better off killing this treacherous hero who called himself the Han Chancellor, or would he have been better off escorting him to the emperor? Leaving aside Cao Cao's capture and execution, Liu Bei, having removed a scourge from the Han Dynasty, would naturally receive a special reward from the emperor, perhaps being ordered to act as Prime Minister, with the same respect as Cao Cao, or even being granted a higher title, which would be the highest honor. However, what would this have to do with Zhuge Liang? As the saying goes, "The head cannot be bigger than the hat." With the hat covering his head, Kongming would have to be subordinate to Liu Bei no matter what. If Liu Bei only had an empty title of king, Kongming would only be an official like a Situ, so why would he have left his thatched hut? Moreover, Liu Xuande was originally an ambitious hero who harbored the idea that "the world belongs to everyone." That is why he braved the wind and snow to visit the Crouching Dragon in his thatched hut three times. His emphasis on talent was not for seeking talents for the country, but for his personal cause. Similarly, Zhuge Liang came to support Liu Bei's claim to the throne, so he was willing to develop his ambitions. If they could achieve unification of the world, Liu Bei would undoubtedly ascend the throne and become emperor, and he would be a founding hero, the Grand Chancellor, a king with equal status. Even if they took a step back and ended up in a three-way stalemate, he could still be called Prime Minister, wielding military and political power. Since Xuan De and Kongming had such aspirations, it is clear that killing Cao Cao and taking over his position were not their original intentions at all. To say that Xuan De would also emulate Cao Cao's later behavior, or even abolish the Han Emperor and establish himself as emperor, such an act of usurpation was not only something he could not do, but also something that Zhuge, who valued name and position, would not allow him to do. However, if Cao Cao was really captured and killed at Huarong Trail, may I ask what good idea Liu Bei would have other than usurping the throne to become emperor himself?</p>
<h3>Scattered Anecdotes from the Broadcasting Circle (1)</h3>
<p>— Bi Hua</p>
<p>After the author wrote an article on "Broadcasting Life" in this publication previously, I received many letters from readers who wanted me to write another article on the history and status of broadcasters. This matter cannot be finished in a few words if one wants to talk about it in detail. Indeed, there is very little record of broadcasters in newspapers and magazines now, which is something readers are eager to know. Because broadcasters have a close relationship with the entertainment industry, the author takes this opportunity to write about it in detail, categorizing it and publishing it in this publication's valuable space. It is hoped that the readers who love to read this newspaper and listen to the radio will be sympathetic! Now, let's start with spoken drama, and later there will be storytelling, commentary, stories, Shanghai opera, songs, Siming documents, Yong opera, Southern opera, Weiyang opera, comedy, etc., which will be contributed to the readers of this newspaper one after another.</p>
<p>(1) Spoken Drama</p>
<p>Gu Leiyin was one of the earliest to broadcast spoken dramas on the radio. He was not very popular on stage, but he became very popular on the radio. He was originally a spoken drama artist who adapted stage plays into radio plays, with a script that was clearer than on stage. He used his eloquence to please the audience, and he had a complete cast of male and female actors, with crying and laughter, vividly portraying the story, but without the lively expressions of the stage. This was all revealed through his words, which fascinated the audience. The most captivating part was the sound effects, such as the small actions of opening and closing doors, going up escalators, etc., which were vividly depicted in the air. All the sounds were imitated to the fullest extent, meticulously portraying the details, making the listeners feel as if they were there, enjoying themselves so much that they forgot to return. He personally led the entire cast and sometimes participated in the broadcast himself, taking it very seriously. According to him, although it is still a spoken drama, the spoken drama on the radio is completely different from the spoken drama on stage, and the spoken drama on the radio is several times more difficult. The listeners may think it is very ordinary, but the broadcasters are trembling and cannot be careless at all. They also have to understand dialects, what each person should say. Sometimes mistakes can be overlooked on stage, but on the radio, smart listeners will not let you get away with it, and if you say something wrong, they will call to question you. In particular, the dialogue must be paid attention to. The dialogue between two people is still easy, but the most difficult is when there are many people together. This kind of dialogue is the most difficult, and it must be clear and distinct, otherwise, if you are not careful, you will reveal your mistakes, because often one person plays two roles, and of course, there are two different tones. This makes it difficult, so the reason why Gu Leiyin's spoken drama has always been popular on the radio is because he takes it seriously.</p>
<h3>The Refugee Association's Hometown Group Gave a Banquet to the Leaders of Seven Changxi Opera Troupes</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Broadcast on the Mainland Radio Station on April 2nd and 3rd</p>
<p>The Shanghai Refugee Relief Association's Hometown Group scheduled a joint performance of seven Changxi opera troupes to be held at the Lake Society on Guizhou Road for three days, April 7th, 8th, and 9th. The previous evening, the Hometown Group held a banquet at the Dafa Food Company to entertain the leaders of the seven Changxi opera troupes, including Huang Cuifang, Wang Peigen, Shen Huanan, Chen Meisen, Zhang Maosheng, Chen Ajiu, and Yang Doutong, with Hu Shouqi and Cao Zhigong, the general directors, serving as hosts. During the banquet, the leaders of each troupe reported the total number of tickets they had sold, which was estimated to exceed 1,000 yuan. Mr. Hu, standing in the position of a Changzhou fellow villager, hoped that the Changxi opera's participation in this disaster relief movement would leave a deep impression on the social community and enhance its status in the entertainment industry. Regarding ticket sales, he also hoped that each troupe would make a final effort to create even more satisfactory results. Finally, it was decided to hold a broadcast promotion for ticket sales on the Mainland Radio Station on April 2nd and 3rd, with the participation of the most outstanding actors from each troupe. This banquet can be considered a complete success.</p>
<h3>Liu Baoquan Will Arrive in Shanghai Soon</h3>
<p>Still Performing at the Greater China Hotel</p>
<p>Liu Baoquan, the king of drum singing, performed at the Greater China Hotel three years ago and was a great success. The hotel's owner, Dai Buxiang, recently specially asked Huang Jinrong and Jin Tingsun to invite Liu Baoquan to Shen again for another performance. It is reported that Mr. Liu has already agreed. Mr. Dai has specially sent Deputy Manager Jiang Xiaolan to Tianjin and Beijing to welcome him. He is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 20th, accompanied by Xie Ruizhi, Dong Guizhi, Jiao Xiulan, Li Wenfang, Cheng Yulan, Zhang Shazi, Zhang Mazi, Li Wen, and others, a total of more than ten people.</p>
<p>Yesterday, this publication received a letter from the "Shanghai People's Construction Committee," which stated: After the Shanghai film industry is revoked, it must produce films according to the following guidelines, otherwise, it will be adhering to the enemy's corrupt policies and should be sanctioned.</p>
<p>1.  The film industry must recognize its responsibility to resist Japan and build the nation. 2. The regulations of the Central Film Censorship Committee must still be followed. 3. Absolutely no horror or pornographic films are allowed. 4. Scripts with love as the main theme are not allowed. 5. More educational films that enlighten the people should be made. 6. Dialogue must use more alarming language.</p>
