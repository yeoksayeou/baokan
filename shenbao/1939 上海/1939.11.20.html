<h3 id="c10">念捷克與波蘭 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>有關捷克與波蘭之各種紀載，迄今猶佔世界報紙之重要篇幅皆能有聲有色，近日如捷克前總統貝奈斯氏領導之復國運動，捷克境內因民族運動之嫌疑而敎授學生以及一般牛民數日內被捕者達五萬人，法國巴黎之波蘭政府閣員正式訪問英國倫敦，波蘭人士在法國編練客籍軍將完成，波蘭軍艦編入英國艦隊共同作戰；凡此捷波國族政治軍事消息，允舉世視聽所注者也。</p>
<p>捷克於本年三月間爲德意志所兼併，波蘭於本年十月間爲德意志與蘇聯所瓜分。兼併與瓜分皆事實，然皆未確定之問題，甚或可以論斷爲必須平反抑亦必能平反之問題，蓋波蘭政府依然存在，捷克之若干駐外使節依然存在，各國視爲波捷之合法代表；國際否認兼併瓜分爲合理合法，從而否認其事實之爲有效：英法兩國對德作戰，以恢復捷波兩國爲作戰主要目標之一，捷波參預此戰，而此戰正在進行之中，未決勝敗。因此種種，居今日而言捷克與波蘭：旣未可謂爲健在，又未可謂爲已亡；旣非名亡而實存，亦非名存而實亡，蓋在不絕如縷之悲慘過程之中，此其存亡絕續之一霎那也。吾人深爲之同情，允爲之鑑戒；每聞捷波近事，輒覺棖觸無窮！爰撮數端，告吾讀者。</p>
<p>今之領導捷克復國運動者目奈斯氏，昨猶發表論文，暢陳歐洲大勢；此君蓄道德，能文章，在二十餘年前，以從事捷克革命建國運動，聲譽至隆；然嚴格律之，捷克之今春遭厄，貝奈斯氏與有責焉。兼併捷克者德國，德國肆意侵略，對捷克挑撥離間，暴力威脅，是不可恕，亦不必論。就捷克本身論之，自誤者三：（一）以强鄰窺伺而猶狃於種族與信仰之殊，不能精誠團結，共禦外侮；爲蘇台德區，爲斯洛伐克族，引狼入室，遂遭其厄。（二）以貝奈斯氏負國家重任，旣不能消弭國內矛盾，復不知强鄰侵略無餍；雖嘗豪語曰「捷克政府務求避免戰爭，但亦決心爲生存而抗戰」，顧乃德軍侵入蘇台德區之後，遽以爲戰且不勝，不如不戰，割地謀和，可期瓦全；以當時情况衡之，豈不曰能屈能伸，識時俊傑，詎料委屈求全而水深火熱，繼以下野遠行，終於大勢日非。（三）以哈嘉繼旦奈斯氏爲總統，根本不知抗戰圖存，更復躬赴敵國，接受亡國條件；歸而詔其人民曰，「德軍機械部隊深入矣，人民若果出而抗戰，徒足以增重亡國之痛」云，是猶自行宣告滅亡。此三段落者，實爲誤國之厲階，捷克愛國人士試一回憶，悔已無及，能不痛心乎？</p>
<p>哈嘉旣以對德妥協之方式，斷送捷克，彼固猶德國勢力控制下之總統也；被制異族，當然無獨立平等可言，言之自欺欺人耳。昨今活劇：德國大捕捷克智識分子與一般平民凡五萬人，拘禁之於集中營，蓋智識分子固爲異族眼中釘，而亡國之民亦自絕無保障也。哈嘉總統在統屬之警察若干名，德人斥爲服務不力，由德國政治警察逮捕之；蓋總統雖爲虎倀，亦不容自畜爪牙也。德國駐捷代表，號稱保護人，要挾哈嘉總統招募捷克壯丁一百萬人，驅之戰塲，並向英法宣戰，而誘之以改稱保護地爲共和國，哈嘉無法應命，遂付軟禁，顧猶不得不向人民廣播演說曰，其各安生業，毋相驚擾，蓋國非其國，人非其人，外交無自由，和戰無自由，自「總統」以迄人民安有所謂自由？而暴力控制之下，許以名稱曰國，許以形態曰共和，總之，旣已亡其國而奴其民，此在大權在握者原無吝乎空名義也。</p>
<p>至於波蘭，雖戰猶瀕於亡，戰不持久之故也。借使德軍侵人之後，抗戰迄今，則波繭現狀決不如今日：假使能繼續抗戰二三年，則英法之所以援助波蘭者亦必事半而功倍；顧乃戰僅四五旬而全軍敗潰，惜哉！所最可稱道者：德國在捷克得哈嘉其人爲之工具，而遍求不得其人於波蘭。據昨日哈瓦斯社羅馬尼亞京城電訉，謂德國謀在波蘭國淪陷區內，組織親德政府；德國當局曾與某報紙主編！某律師，某前任市長先後接洽，均被拒絕，德國企圖業已失敗云。於此可見侵略國家必需傀儡，亦可見傀儡實有助於侵略；波蘭人於萬般慘痛之中，竟無人焉，甘爲傀儡，助長侵略，出賣宗邦同胞，是波蘭國族無上榮譽、亦足以豪矣！</p>

<p>經濟專刊戰爭中中日本經濟之得失  李叔民　　所謂「得失」也者，尙逃不出失」之範疇；蓋因其直接之「失」，固「失」也，即有所「得」，亦「不償失」，實足爲其終生憂者，茲願以共「得」情况詳加檢討，而於「失」之實情，人已多有記叙，於此僅述其綱要而已。　　日本經濟上之損失：（一）軍事費用—預算至一九四〇年止將費日元一百二十五萬萬。若更延長至个九四二年底，則以目前年費日元五十萬萬計，須增日金一百二十五萬萬，共二百五十萬萬日元。（二）日本出口貿易——日對南北美洲·歐洲·非洲之貿易，自中日戰事以來，已减少31/100，將來更有所减。（三）日本之海運收入——此項收入以一九三八年和一九三六年相比，已下跌46/100，商船被迫爲軍事需用。（四）由旅客所得之收入——自戰端開後，收入已减少55/100；此固非永久之損失，然非五年之昇平盛世，不得恢復。（五）準備金——維持日本紙幣之凖備金已由一六〇·〇〇〇萬日元跌至不可檢查之若干萬日元。（六）中國之仇恨——因侵略而產生之中國人對日本之仇恨，將永遠阻止日本欲與中國發生友誼之經濟關係之企圖。　　至若在戰端中所獲得之經濟，須由三方面詳加說明：（一）原料——在原料可得棉花·羊毛·及鐵之富源；但此等富源，就量方面已使日人失望，且尙須費數十萬萬日元之投資才能開發。（二）商業市塲——日人得以操縱中國之入口貿易，然中國人民購買力之崩潰，將限制入口貿易至曩昔之小部份。（三）掠刦日本獲得數家中國工廠·鐵道·電氣廠，大量鐵片；及得自販賣毒品之利益；和由中國人之商業方面所剝削之錢財。然總加上數項利益猶不及日人一揮之成本。　　原料　　按之情理，中國之所以成為日本理想之原料給仰地，實有欺內在之因素，即中國所產之特種原料較其他原料更爲日本所需。一九三六年日本由國外輸入之最多三項爲下表所列：　　該三種佔當年輸入總額45/100，多由英美輸入，由中國輸入者佔極少數。由日本之辯辭云，彼若能制服中國，施以科學生產法，定可使之足以自給。由下列之鐵證，將使彼成爲斷絕之失望。　　（甲）棉花：一九三六年中國為全球第三位產棉國，產額爲四百萬包（每包四七五磅），幾及日本所需總額。然中國棉。紗甚劣（粗）96/100之出產皆由國內紗廠製成棉布出售：即總加供給中國市塲和日本出口貿易之棉不下八百萬包。及一九三九初，中國產棉區多在日本戰綫之後方；因鄉間爲游擊區，故而勸農民减少棉田之70/100，由是可知，在游擊隊消滅之前，彼所得僅及囊昔所產之小數。且即或「治安一恢復，種棉區不能增至戰前水準20/100，否則即有飢荒之虞；除非彼能使一滿洲國」成穀倉以彌新棉田糧食不足，否則須仰世界市塲3/4棉才足。　　（乙）羊毛：我國西北及內蒙所產之羊毛於一九三六多輸往美國，其數，（三千五百萬磅）當日本所須百之十四。日人野心冀能以科學法之能與澳洲競爭。內蒙傀儡政府成立後，允許八家日本羊毛織物製造廠，得獲收羊毛之專利權。日人曾選收優等羊毛五百萬擔（每擔一三三·三磅）較時價允低之値收買，轉售與日本當局，然彼等並未得政府之好感；且中國之畜牧者開始拒絕售給羊毛，於是中國政府牧買之運蘇聯以易他物。一九三八年日本所得者僅及所產之1/3。爲能力所限，日本不能保護之以武力，培養之以資本，而使之能與澳洲相競，至明。　　　（丙）鐵礦：一九三六我國所產之鐵一·三〇〇，〇〇〇噸，幾乎全部運至日本，猶不足彼所耗之萬一。及以後戰事發生所須激增，預算至一九四〇年，須輸入一千萬噸（其中大部冀仰於中國）始得平衡。然此由我國供給之鐵，又爲日人絕望之事。蓋中國主要鐵礦集中於二地—內蒙龍烟和長江之湖北安徽。前者於戰前已停，後者於過去二十年已抵押與日本。及去年，日本始運龍烟之鐵出口，冀得五十萬噸，蓋龍烟鐵礦者僅於戰期中有利可圖，因而吾人懷疑該五十萬噸之鐵能否全得。至若鄂皖二省之鐵於一九三六年已逮其最高峯，然而猶不及其所耗百元念，被雖於一九三八年獲得之，　也　　爲力也。　　商業市場　　中國向為日本最劣等之商業主顧，即人口僅五百萬之臺灣於一九三〇——三六年間購得之日貨多於中國，一九三六年我國銷受日本出口貨百分四餘；此數猶不及我國輸入之1/6。日商冀於軍事佔領中國後必使其貨多銷，此點並未失望：一九三八日本佔領中國十省之主要交通綫，日貨佔我國入口貨百之四六。若單以日軍佔領區計，日貨已佔市塲百之六五。然而此項貿易之增加，多由犧牲歐美商業而得者。其所施之手段（一）於華北發行新幣制（二）所有之鐵道由日人控制歐美貨物輒爲之阻。（三）設傀儡政府以微收外商貨稅。其結果係一九三八年美對華貿易狂跌百五二，英國貿易亦减百四六，德貿易减百三五。且更减少，直至日貨爲入口貨之百八十爲止（和他殖民地相同）。此等並不足明此次戰事對市塲之慘情。自戰事後中國人民購買力之大崩潰即爲其直接之結果。上海一市所受損失近十萬萬元，南京人口由一百廿萬減至萬，廣州由一百萬减至二萬，各地無家可歸之失業者更可驚人，北平有三十萬倚公共救濟爲生之人，上海有五十萬工人失業，靑島之工人無處謀生者亦無慮二十萬。日商固已掠取我國之入口商業，而其更主要之市塲則已縮小至以前之一小部。欲恢復中國繁華之商業須數十萬萬之投資以重建工廠，店舖，家宅，重裝機器，重進貨物，再攘助流亡者重歸故土。然此費豈爲日人所能負者？則商業亦僅可聽其衷替而已。　　搞刦　　掠刦之成因乃在彼「速戰速決」之冀不可得之後果。在上海，日軍曾毀工廠計五二五五家，收其殘破之機器；沿長江之城市，收鐵燈架，溝渠鐵蓋，火爐甚至郵箱，以作日本兵工廠之原料，漢陽兵工廠之機器鐵片。如是所得之鐵共數百萬噸。沿海一帶之工業和公用物刦後所餘者，均爲日商所掠，在華北彼等之掠獲物中有八十家之造麥粉，香烟，水門汀，棉紗，啤酒及蘇打之工廠。　　至於我國之商業，日人亦盡力剝削，華北所有之常鋪，皆須加入日人以爲夥友，沿海城市中著名之旅舍，皆爲迫以市價之一部出賣其財產。中國出口最多之蛋類，其專利權已由日本軍隊給予一退任之軍官。其他，據報載，有軍官已辭軍職，在上海經營蔬菜之獨占事業。　　日本所有專利權中最野蠻者爲其海濱出產公司，彼等擊沉沿海一帶中國之漁船，以機關槍掃射漁夫；按其事當有日本海軍爲其後台。據報云於一九三八年六月至十二月七日間，共計二一六艘漁船爲日本軍用小艇所擊沉。至上海附近漁船之被擊，則更將有所聞。　　經營賭塲，妓院，烟窠者，皆爲隨軍而至中國之數千日商和流氓，其勢漫延甚速，在北平城中共三〇四家販毒品之處，皆須向日本憲警納稅；在上海日人銷售麻醉品，其價每月達一百五十萬華元（據美國阿爾科調查）。總計各處於一九三八年七月共獲利七百萬華元。　　其刧掠情形固已可調浩大極矣，然在其軍閥之心目中猶以為離理想甚遠而輕視云。　　綜上而言，日本奪中國原料之失望，在中國商業中無利可獲之時，利及戰利品掠獲之不多，爲其「得」之總情况；由此三者，遂促使日本剝削計畫之逐漸减少。侵略之初，一日本銀行家宣稱日將以一五〇、〇〇〇萬日元投資華北。三月後上海戰事終止，投資數減至一三〇、〇〇〇萬日元、再四日，蘇州失陷，又减少至八〇、〇〇〇萬日元，去年漢口失陷，更减至三五、〇〇〇萬日元。其資本流至何處？曰：「炸彈，砲彈，槍彈」而已。過去一週　　米價一跳三四元，顯係奸商操縱。但米商還在嘵嘵不休，說明理由：　　（一）日僞扼阻來源。　　（二）日本米荒，來華搜購。　　（三）甚至說米價貴，可以獎勵商販運米來滬。　　姑妄信之：米商實和全體市民，同屬被壓迫份子。而且他們最近還希望銀錢界擴大米押款，以便他們替市民囤購，「積穀防饑」。因爲租界當局設倉儲糧的計劃事實上不能實行之故。足見他們還是關懷民生，保障民食的人！理該感激。　　不過米業中絕無敗類，未敢輕信。像工部局初試限價時，就有不少米商，因爲違法而被捕。這便是公開的例子。　　再者，上述三種理由，我們也未敢再「姑妄信之」。所謂「獎勵商販」云云，更屬笑話。且對於操縱之舉，顯已不打自招。至於首兩點，也有問題。因爲：　　上海人，除絕少數例外，大多數和淪陷區不通聲息。日僞究在搗些什麼鬼？只是人云亦云，無從明白。而且斷絕中國人的生計，殺害中國人的生命，正是日偽的本來面目。大規模侵略中國，屠殺華人的事，尙在繼續進行。因此扼阻米的來滬，自可深信不疑。但奇怪的（一）何以最近的日偽報紙，幾無此項紀載？（二）何以日本關册上，不見華米輸日的數字？反見日粉大量來華的紀錄。（三）僞組織的財源，便靠苛征暴歛。如果禁米運滬，他們便要受大宗損失。淪陷區裏的米，運滬愈多，他們收入也愈多。禁止出口，豈非自殺？（四）若謂正因苛征，所以米貴。苛征當係事實，問題在征收多少？而且旣因苛征而米貴，一貴後，絕無跌價餘地：何以前决竟又一度傾瀉？俗話說得好：「鷄棚上的黄鼠狼，不偷鷄也是偷鷄的」日僞的爲非作惡，像黄鷄狼一樣：誰都不願而且不能辯護。不過上舉幾點疑問，也値得注意。我們可以相信的事實是：日僞的苛征是事實；爲了苛征而阻難運米來滬也是事實。但他們目的在收入，如果苛征過分，便根本無人去買。所以他們的暴歛，必有限度，日偽旣在苛征，滬上又無從知道他們實征多少；米業敗類便以此爲抬價居奇的藉口。上海米價旣貴，日僞苛征時當然又要擴大要求；於是上海米價更貴。上海米價，經他們如此狼狽爲奸，於是一漲再漲。累得人心慌張，吃戶多購，投機者更參加囤積。如是造成今日的現象。這是過去米價暴漲的理由。　　至於此次米價再漲，上述理由，不無變化。一因新米上市，再因各地豐收；各方一致望小；日僞顧全收入計，只得减低敲索。這是前决米價一度回小的理由。　　米價既崩跌，囤積者大恐。於是他們利用種種機會，或製造種種空氣。如某公團請求租界常局設倉儲糧，以及今决日本米荒的消息，便是給他們利用的機會。最近各報又喧載大量洋米進口的消息，揆之情理，即屬事實，亦斷非新定貨。什九必是上决米荒中的定單於此次交貨罷了。因爲他的定價，果與今日米價不相上下，但較今次漲價前則貴出多多，在上次米價暴漲時，各方尙無利可圖而不願進洋米；何况現在。但此種消息的散播，却大可暗示各界：滬上米荒，又到了非進洋米不可的程度了」。洋米這樣貴，杜米當然更要貴」。米價回漲囤積者回生有望，不僅此也：（一）秋收登塲不久，且又鹽收，內地存底大厚。（二）農民還債，年關前急於求售。（三）地主因內地生活動盪，不敢囤積；必需脫售。（四）囤戶手裏尙有許多陳米，越囤越不受人歡迎；必趁貴脫手。（五）剛才上市的新米，未便久藏。（六）日本米荒，因立塲關係，不無過甚共詞。且可以日本關册，證明華米輸日的不確。日商搜米，若屬事實，也不過轉售各地華商，從中漁利。但並不影響中國米市上的供給力可知。職是之故，米價勢必回跌。尤其此次回漲，什九出於奸商，靠空氣來實施他的金蟬脫壳之計。在他們傾售時，勢必大跌，可以斷言。  予　　市面上一切如常，××毫不短少，任何人都照樣用出，絕未有所變化，但最近的烟紙店，却對人說：「日本人在搜××，所以市上很少；你要，必需貼水」。日本人搜××，何以只有烟紙店裏的人知道？除非日本人專向他們搜。不然，他們又在利用黄鼠狼而實行他們搗亂的詭計。無論是前者或後者，他們總不能掩飾他們助桀爲虐的罪惡。國家勢力離滬後，他們為非作亞的勾當做得實在太多了！相信總有和他們總算賬的一天。而而在，大家先應謹防入殼。尤其希望電車公司及一般大公司的常局，對於屬員嚴厲監督，謹防收入的××被屬員們整批讓渡於烟紙店才行。  予商業新聞糧食　囤戶見機脫手　米價漲後突回　常粳開過四十元　　近週米價、自打破沉寂空氣、突呈暴漲後、以前週二十八九元之常粳價與今市相較、數日間、已突漲十元有奇、粳米如此、各尖亦然、照此突然暴漲、若不從速設法、則米價飛騰、奚有底止、考其緣由、雖不外乎某方統制、從中壟斷來源、時遭阻碍等因、但多亦由一般囤戶居間作祟耳、昨市到貨計有蘇嘉崑太靑泗等貨近三十車、市面漲風愈熾、一般做心思者、以前决高峯曾逾四十元大關、私忖目下米價尙可望好、未及開市、即出搜羅、客販恒以元數相抬、致晨初市面混沌、不分優劣、並提二三元不一、後本鄉店胃及內地帮暢辦之下、市面一路飛升、竟增至四五元之巨、常特粳開出四十元、蘇崑白粳亦開三十八九元、窰菉種至三十七八元、客尖達三十六七元、詎料美景不常、市面一轟太足、店家及內地帮一般實胃、際此高貴之價格、合算

<p>衣食住行物質利用  陳亮　　一隻破了底的面盆，還有什麽用呢？自然是拋棄在垃圾桶裏完結。可是我看見隔壁那戶人家，却利用那隻破面盆栽大蒜，居然欣欣向榮，靑葱可愛，煮魚炒蛋，折幾許做香頭，不費分文，眞使我佩服。像這樣的利用物質，化無用爲有用，是値得效法，至少對於經濟方面，不無補益。　　這麽說，並非教家家戶戶都用破面盆種大蒜，僅屬一個例子而已。天生萬物，原須各致其用，有用之物不可暴殄致廢，即使廢物，亦須設法利用一下。爛稻柴還可造紙，屍骨的燐質還可製火柴，址圾可充肥料，天下是沒有絕對的廢物的。富家拋棄的餅乾桶，却輾轉變爲小六子的飯合了。　　一隻汲水的鉛桶　而且漏了，或者是一隻骯髒的油漆鐵桶，在我們家庭裏，看來又何需多此累贅！但是不妨把它們保留，犯不着給舊貨担塌便宜，祇須略一改造，去酒店買塊酒　泥，便可改造成一隻堅固實用的煤泥爐，這是極其合算而且容易的事，何樂不爲呢！孩子們猶能利用大人的香烟空盒蓋片做西洋鏡，難道我們的智慧還及不來孩子！　　在一般苦力階級者的家庭裏，他們是沒有衣櫥和衣箱的，一半限於經濟，一半却也限於地位，唯一放置他們衣服的東西，是粗糙的肥皂板箱，或者是一些裝水果和雜貨的木箱，箱子裏面糊一層舊新聞紙，在他們看來，却是十足道地的衣箱了。在貧乏的環境下，他們只能這樣利用一下。際斯戰亂，眞正富裕之家，恐佔少數，在可能範圍之內，人人應儘量利用物質。减輕經濟負担，更爲國家節省物力。　　橡膠車輪裏胎，曾經被人利用了做寬緊帶，外胎被利用配作鞋底，經濟耐用。至今還繼續利用着。我們不要輕視一隻小小的螺絲釘，也許正有一架大機器因缺少這隻小螺絲釘而不能發動。留聲機的唱針也可代替小洋釘，在壁間懸掛鏡框。等而下之，我們利用空墨水瓶養花，壞電燈泡養金魚，亦未嘗不可賞心娛目呵。找房子  卡蒙　　我最怕是搬家，因為搬家任何人都不會否認，是一件最麻煩的事，凡是搬過家的人，味道十九是嘗過的；因此，我除非萬不得已，是決不搬家的，六七年來祗搬過兩回一家。　　然而這一次可使我不能不搬了，房租的壓迫，已使我不能再遲疑下去。物價的上漲，使生活程度這樣高，別的還可節省，房租到月先付後住，可少不了一文的。戰前我借的一間廂房，祗十多塊錢，現在加了三次租已近三十元了。在二房東還以為我是老房客，比較新房客要便宜多，在我委實不勝負擔，在昇平時代尙且出不起那麽多房租，何况在亂世。終於在兩不滿意之下，決定搬家，東西賣掉一些房子住小些，壞些想必總可便宜一些，减輕一部分負擔。　　搬家之前，先得要去找房子，又是一件挺麻煩的事。房子大小？扶梯好走不好走？哂台是怎樣？灶間是怎樣？房東是怎樣的人？又要顧到大人，又要顧到小孩，的確不是一件容易的事。本來在兩個月中，物價高漲，生活艱難，上海曾走去一部分人，而空屋也比較多了些。然而等到我要找房子，召租紙突然减少起來。主要的原因，就研究所得，蘇州河北，滬西一帶，最近有不少搬到中區，所以公共租界的中區房屋又减少了。　　在這種情形之下，二房東又獲得大好機會，儘可高抬租價。我一連跑了五六天，這一次在找房子方面，又使我獲得了許多經騐。看見召租紙，統廂房，統樓，我不敢去問津，前樓，亭子間，前客堂，也許比較配胃口。然而不是太小，就是房租太貴，委實找不到適當的房屋。有的地方召租上寫的是三層樓，走去看看是擱樓。有的地方寫着下亭子間，走去一看是灶披間。好吧？擱樓美其名曰三層樓，灶披間改稱下亭子間，這又是「孤島」上二房東在屋少人多，大抬房租的當兒一種新發明。　　中區再也找不到適當的房子，除了屋子的本身以外，有的人家人多不租，有小孩不租，先付押租兩月或三月，我有三個孩子，一家五人，不算多，但也不能算少；先付押租身無餘資，所以租房子比較格外難。聽說徐家匯比較便宜，我就趕去，那邊召租紙比較多，房租的確也便宜，但想到離敎書的學校太遠，每天要化不少車錢，還是不上算。後來想到滬西一帶，膽小的人家都在搬家，房租總可便宜，又坐了車子趕去，結果是租到了一個前樓，月租十五元，在今日「孤島」，可算是便宜的了。但我那二房東，一上一下的房子，租下來祗二十二元一月呀！明知東山老虎吃人，西山老虎也要吃人，祗是暫且圖幾月再講。人家在離開滬西，我却搬到滬西去，朋友們也許不以爲然，但我相信工部局對越界築路地段，決不肯輕易放棄的。林肯坐和雙層火車  毓俊　　在一百零二年以前，那時候火車在美國剛在創始，火車的速度有時候比馬車還要慢，在鐵路旁，常有馬車和火車比賽。　　當林肯一八六一年被選爲大總統到華盛頓去上任的時候所做火車是雙層的，這輛車子到現在還存在着，陳列在百闊摩博物館裏。　　這古老的火車，如果要行駛起來，現在的軌道，不能合用，還要製造十九世紀的軌道，才可以走，這車子的速率每一個鐘頭，只走十八里，遇到山坡就不能前進，必需乘客們跳下車來，共同合作，才能把那車子推上了山坡。這部車子已經上過銀幕，米高梅的“Stand　Up　＆　Fight”一片中，就有這輛車子出現。該片不久以前曾在南京大戲院開映，讀者中愛看電影的，也許已經欣賞過了。一星期經濟菜單  華英女士　　薺菜是一種野生的菜蔬，在鄕下本來不必出錢去買，小兒女閒來無事，拿一把小刀子或剪刀，到野地上去掘取，眞的是「俯拾即是」，這就呌做挑薺菜。可是住在都市中，却也不得不出了錢去買薺菜吃了。薺菜本有一種特殊的鮮味，與黃豆芽一樣，所以無論怎樣煮法，都是很鮮的。最普通的，是薺菜炒肉絲，薺菜燒豆腐，倘在裏頭放些肉絲和菱粉，便是肉絲豆腐羹。你倘要講究一些，那麽薺菜炒冬笋，薺菜炒難片，更是鮮美適口，連「味精」等一切調味粉都不需要的了。此外把薺菜和猪肉切爛，做成肉圓，嵌在油豆裏或麵筋裏，放湯同煮，也比單純的嵌肉油豆腐和嵌肉麵筋來得可口，大家何妨一試。　　星期一　　薺菜肉麫筋　紅燒靑魚片　雪菜菉豆芽　束冬菜粉皮　　星期二　　咖喱牛肉片　淸炊鯽魚湯　葱油蘿蔔絲　菠菜燒豆腐　　星期三　　薺菜炒肉絲　韮芽炒蟹粉　油條炒靑菜　蝦子炒麵筋　　星期四　　膠菜肉絲湯　糖醋煎黃魚　亁絲金花菜　紅燒荀亁絲　　星期五　　番薯牛肉餅　紅燒蘿蔔片　鹹鮝燒豆腐　靑菜炒綫粉　　星期六　　靑菜獅子頭　蟹粉燉雞蛋　甜醬炒刀豆　紅燒捲心菜　　星期日　　乳腐肉　煎帶魚　黃豆芽　炒芹菜嬰兒最適宜之食品（上）  朱煒醫師　　今之論者，每致慨於靑年體格之脆弱，謂欲强國强種，必先求全國人民，尤其是靑年，俱有剛健之體格，方能使炎黃胄裔，成爲堅勁有爲之民族，此一問題，關係甚大，値此非常時期，尤宜注意，顧欲養成剛健體格之靑年，更當注意嬰兒之保育，保育嬰兒之方法，不能改進，剛健體格之靑年，文何由養成，譬之植物，靑年已入於發榮滋長之境，嬰兒在襁褓中，則其萌芽時期也。萌芽不能秀茁，安能發榮滋長，此理甚明，顧普通社會猶多忽視，爰草是篇，供有兒者之參考。　　嬰兒之營養物為母乳或牛乳，乳粉等，但除乳汁之外，在斷乳前後，是否應另與以其他各種食物？以何種食物為最宜？此一問題，即醫家所謂「添食」問題，各國專家對此，恒議論紛紜，且因氣候，風俗，習慣之不同，主張亦各異，「添食」影響嬰兒之發育與健康甚大，尤與斷乳有關，故特擇其大要，分述於後：　　穀粉與穀類　初生兒自第二個月起，可於牛乳中另加等分之穀粉（大麥，小麥，雀麥，米），即俗所謂粥湯，麥粉糊（麥粉中加水煮沸，調成糊狀，然後冲以牛乳）等，爲牛乳之稀釋液，以補牛乳中營養素之不足，在我國本以穀類（粥）爲乳兒後半期之主食，亦即斷乳前後所必需者，普通自第五個月開始，初於午前十時授乳之前，與以一茶匙薄粥，後立即給與牛乳或母乳，漸次增加其量及濃度，由於粥量之增加，而漸减牛乳之量，粥或麥粉糊等中，稍加食鹽亦可。　　果汁　乳兒以用橘子汁爲宜，加等量之溫水冲薄之，或加少量之糖亦佳，不易得橘子汁而起下痢樣時，可用新鮮蕃茄汁或罐如蕃茄汁亦可。對母乳營養兒與果汁普通自第三個月開始，人工營養則較早，始自第二個月，但Hess氏謂人工營養兒之果汁，自第二星期終了時，即可開始。最初服一茶匙（僅果汁之謂），一日一次，漸次增量（例如每一星期增加一茶匙），至五六個月時，約為二十餘茶匙，以後即照此量與之，果汁與牛乳混和同時服亦佳。</p>

<p>春秋新橋街是舊貨大本營  星　　各種舊貨排列整齊琳瑯滿目　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　代客贖當是利息優厚的買賣　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　劣貨充斥更多偷竊來的贓物　　踏上法租界新橋街，轉灣到寗波路，一直到敏體尼蔭路口，那兩邊路旁挨一排二的，都是專做舊貨買賣的「舊貨攤」。在營業鼎盛的時代，那兒大小的攤戶，緊接得沒有一些空隙，倘若總共的來統計一下，必在百數相近。自上海經過戰神洗禮之後，又添出了許多新設的攤戶，但是却並不因攤多而營業感到淸淡。　　最簡陋的舊貨攤，祇有一付收舊貨的擔子，在前後的二隻竹籃中，陳列着幾雙舊皮鞋，幾件舊衣裳，和一些雜亂的小物件。甚至於一塊小包袱，在地上一攤，放上幾件舊貨，亦算一個舊貨攤。然而設備比較完善的幾個舊貨攤，却能佔到一間多門面的地位，貨物也排列得相當的整齊，各種的舊貨，亦比較充足，分門別類，琳琅滿目。但亦有一攤專售一種舊貨者，若專售衣裳者，祇有四季的各式衣着，而並無其他的舊貨同時兼售。並有專售古董者，有幾個規模較大的古董舊貨攤，亦有大小不等的古董物件陳列着。在這舊貨大本營中，最普遍的舊貨，要算衣服，銅錫器，碗盞，電燈用品，皮鞋雨傘等物。其次比較高貴些的，如鐘錶，書籍，皮箱，脚踏車，機械零件，無綫電零件，麻雀牌等物。至於最高貴的舊貨，如傢具，無綫電收音機，望遠鏡，照相機等物。更進一步，如翡翠珠子的首飾，綢緞皮貨的衣服，有時亦有點綴其間。還有幾個優等的舊貨攤，亦兼營代客贖當的新興事業。以醒目的字跡，書着專收當票的小招牌，因此一般持有當票而無錢贖取的赤貧者，每以當票廉價售與這般舊貨攤上，爭取物件的最後一些代價。他們購得當票之後，視物質的優劣，票價的貴賤，再確定他的營業方針，有直接以當票轉售給他人，亦有先以物件贖出後，再視物估價而出售。總之，據許多專收當票者的經騐報吿，收買當票，確是有厚利可賺的一種好買賣。　　但是舊貨攤上所出售的物件，却並不是完全舊貨，亦有以新貨充作舊貨出售。這種「充貨」，大都是偷工减料或改頭換面的劣貨，猶如五馬路滿庭坊的舊貨攤，向稱舊貨攤中之佼佼者，出售的物件，新舊皆有。泰半以銅器門鎖及自來墨水筆爲大宗，如派克，康克令等的高貴自來墨水筆。然亦有以劣貨，魚目混珠，充斥其間，若顧客偶一疏忽，即費高貴的代價，而購得低賤的劣貨，欲貪便宜，結果反而損失。故欲買舊貨者，需具有精確的辨別能力，和靈通的行情市價，才不致上這般「舊黑心」的當！　　至於這種舊貨的來源，內容實非常複雜，的確因物主貧苦而以舊貨出售者，實不及其中的半數。而大都數是從「三隻手」那兒收下來的贓物，倘嚴格的說一句，舊貨攤實際是竊賊　脫贓的唯一好地方。　　校對生活  小史　　本來是「三百六十行，行行出狀元」的，然而在這「吃一行怨一行」的時代，要出「狀元」是難乎其難的，幾乎是近於荒誕的空想！朋友們都羨慕我的「校對」生活，說是旣有「書看」，又有「錢拿」，一舉兩得，眞是「上帝」賜福於我，在我的友朋中算是「得天獨厚」了！　　可是天！我眞萬勿敢當接受「上帝」的賜福，對於友朋的羨慕，也覺得友朋對生活的「奢望」也着實太可憐了。　　不錯，我有「書看」，還有「錢拿」，在朋友們終日忙碌中，一天之中難得有二小時的「看書」時間，看了我終日間坐在辦公桌之旁，筆不停醮紅墨水，眼不離開「初校」「二校」以至「淸樣」，這樣的生活豈不是羨煞人哉乎？現在我就以「看書」和「拿錢」二者來談談，可見一個校對者，實在對他給別人認爲很好的生活，也在「怨恨」哩！　　先談「看書」吧。不錯的校對是整天地校着白紙黑字，所謂白紙黑字，拼湊攏來，就是名目不同內容各異的書本子了。校完一本書本子，也就讀完了一本書本子，這不是很好麽？兩天校一本，一個月可讀十五本書，這樣的生活，比起在大學裏讀書，也寫意得多了！可是這只是對校對生活的一種空想、校對者果然每二天（假定的）可以看完一本書，但這也只是「看完」一本書而已！第一，校對的全神貫注者每個「個別」的字是否有誤；第二，他右手握紅墨水水筆，左手要點着原稿上的字，雙眼不時由原稿到校樣，再由校樣移到原稿，這樣機械地一個字一個字地死校着下去。就以此二點，所謂看書，只是「校字」，等到全書校完，也只是印在腦子裏的一碗「炒三鮮」，或者「什錦菜」，不像平時看一本書，能對這一本書有一個整然的系統。　　「看書」旣是那樣，那末「拿錢」呢？脫起「拿錢」，眞要使我傷心。我是一個「包工制」的，就是說，由書局裏面給你一本書，限你幾日校好，該書如果十萬字，那末依照每萬字大洋五角，十萬字即法幣五元正，一天校五萬，包你要吃「頭痛粉」，沒法，只得少校點，就三萬吧，一天所得只是一元又半。校對生活非但在物質報酬上的微小，同時心理也會弄到憂慮，常常因此神經衰弱，因爲校對一頁，總歸深恐還有錯字沒校出。有些書局門檻很精，「初校」給你，「二校」他們自已來，當然，「初校」麻煩，「二校」便當，這樣一來，吃虧的是「初校」，因爲「初校」「二校」，價格同樣，都是萬字五角。這點，很希望有些書局能注意及此，加以改良。當然，現在生活程度，平地漲起幾倍，而書局老闆又是文化界人，所謂「讀書知理」，「理」又比常人「通」，所以對於一個可憐的校對者的報酬，也該「略爲」增加一些了！　　我之被朋友可羨慕的生活，原是如此，寫了出來，朋友、們看見，不知又會失望不會？不過，話得說回來，雖然「炒三鮮」，「什錦菜」，沒有整然的系統，但倒底也有一點點「碎雜」的印象的。要不是這點，我寗願脫掉長衫，去作「小販」！雨過天青  包天笑　　第十七回　習外勤報人新領域　服內務學舍小排塲　　　　還有那個小銀行的匯劃部，倒也很爲熱鬧。由學校裏滙出去的款項，比較少一點，只不過是購買儀器書籍之需。而由別地方劃到這裏來的較多，因爲有許多學生的學家屬，寄出錢來，都是到這個學校的小銀行，你去領取，手續可便捷得多。現在這種小銀行，不但是大學校裏，臨時設立。往往有些大公司，或是大工廠裏，也有那些臨時銀行設立。也有的由銀行裏和這個機關裏訂立了契約，每天派一兩位職員來辦事，到晚上回到銀行裏結賬。也有的不是天天來的，只逢着星期一三五來的。也有的每天在下午一兩點鐘來的，因爲這是個放飯假的時候。種種情形不一，只有你的時間，是怎樣最便利與合宜。他們有許多地方，很爲簡便，只要有一張特別製定的桌子，好像一爿銀行，都在這裏了。當時人家稱之爲「銀行擺攤頭」。其實銀行的意義，一方面原是爲便利羣衆，一方面他們也可以博取羨餘，這原也是服務而互相利益的事，管什麽攤頭不攤頭。豈必一定要造了巍巍然的大理石大洋房，裏面金碧輝煌的裝上燦爛放光的銅欄干，坐着幾個西裝壁挺，像煞有介事，對人一點不和氣的那種銀行，始得謂之銀行嗎？再有信託服務社裏所設立的小商店，那不過是一種合作消費社罷了。現在的中國，合作社到處通行，這個合作社所消費的自然以學堂用品占大多數了。學校中的合作社，另有一種辦法，大約以學生爲主體，自有一種公定的學校消費合作法，照了這個法子辦理，不在話下。還有那個小印刷所，雖然是很小的，倒也很忙。第一是這個東吳大學校，每一星期要出一種校刊。這校刋倒也要消行好幾萬份，不但是本學校的敎職員們與學生們，都定閱這校刊。別個文化機關，或是學生家屬間與個人們，也都定閱這校刊。因爲每一期，常常有名人演說，學術論文。而且那個大學校裏，每一星期，便要開好幾次會。每一個會的報吿，都在週刋上發表，因此雖是一個核刋，資料甚多，內容很富，人家都願意定一份看看咧。正是：　　自有文章驚海內　請看學校遍寰中　（二〇四）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chinese Army Wins Successively in Western Shanxi, Recovers Xi County and Captures Yitaitou, Defeated Japanese Troops Retreat Eastward and Suffer Heavy Casualties in Chinese Interception, War Situation Stable in the Qinnanfang Area of Southern Guangdong <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Xingji: After days of siege by the Chinese army, over two hundred remaining Japanese troops abandoned Xi County last night and fled eastward, and the city was recovered. (Dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Xingji: The mountain range east of Xiangning was once captured by the Chinese army on the 17th at noon. Subsequently, the Japanese army reinforced from Yitaitou and launched a counterattack. A main force of the Chinese army attacked the Yitaitou section of the mountain range again yesterday morning. After several fierce battles, the mountain range and Yitaitou were indeed recaptured at 11:00 am. When the Japanese retreated eastward, they were ambushed by a certain Chinese unit, resulting in even more casualties. (Dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Xingji: On the 14th, over three hundred Japanese infantry and cavalry, accompanied by two artillery pieces, advanced from Jishan in separate routes to Gaoshui (northeast of Jishan) and Han's Village (southwest of Liqu). They were ambushed by a certain Chinese army unit. The Japanese army suffered losses and fled back to Jishan in disarray. (Dispatch from the 17th)</p>
<p>Xingji: After capturing Changzhen near Xiangning, a certain Chinese unit encountered Japanese troops retreating through the town. They immediately launched a brave interception. When the Japanese troops fled to Guantou, they were ambushed again by the Chinese army, leaving behind over a hundred corpses. The remaining Japanese troops retreated eastward in confusion, and the Chinese army captured many military supplies. (Dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Shaoguan: Japanese troops in Qin County suffered a major blow from the Chinese army, resulting in heavy losses and preventing them from advancing north. As of the 19th, the brave Chinese defending forces were still holding the Dasiwei Nongziping area, engaging in fierce battles with the Japanese. (Dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Guilin: In the Nanlu area, continuous rain and fog persist. The war situation in the Qinnanfang area is stable. According to front-line news this morning, there are over two thousand Japanese troops each in Qin County and Fangcheng, four hundred Japanese troops in Dazhiwei (north of Fangcheng), over two hundred Japanese troops in Huangwutun (north of Maoweihai), and a Japanese platoon stationed in Pingyindu (east of Qin County). (Dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Chongqing: This morning, most Chinese newspapers here did not mention any news about the Beihai battle. Only the "Saodang Bao," the mouthpiece of the Chinese army, carried a dispatch from its correspondent in Qujiang, northern Guangdong, stating that fierce fighting was taking place in the Fangcheng area, and the "Dagong Bao" carried a telegram from Guilin stating that Chinese and Japanese armies were currently facing off in southern Guangdong without any new developments. According to Chinese sources, the silence of Chinese newspapers regarding the Beihai battle may be due to the Chinese army's setbacks or an attempt to prevent the leakage of Chinese army movements in the area. (Reuter's dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Hong Kong: Japanese troops who landed in Qinzhou Bay were severely attacked by the Chinese army near Fangcheng, suffering heavy losses. Subsequently, the Japanese army gradually reinforced and launched fierce attacks. On the morning of the 17th, Japanese warships intruded into the sea near Litou, Qin County, under the cover of Japanese aircraft, and forcibly landed. The Chinese army bravely resisted, but eventually, due to the destruction of their positions, they painfully retreated. On the morning of the 18th, the Japanese army advanced from Qin County in two routes. After fierce counterattacks by the Chinese army, the Japanese reinforced again. Fierce fighting is currently taking place in the area from north of the Yuanping Highway to near Dasi. As of noon, the bloody battle is still ongoing. (Dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Guilin: Two batches of Japanese aircraft, totaling thirteen, raided Nanning twice on the afternoon of the 19th at 3:00 pm, dropping many incendiary bombs. Losses are unknown. (Dispatch from the 19th)</p>
<p>Guilin: The Japanese troops who occupied Fangcheng had increased to one or two thousand by the evening, including over three hundred cavalry. Their subsequent troops are still continuing to land. By the 17th, several hundred infantry and artillery had invaded Dazhiwei, north of Fangcheng, and several Japanese aircraft distributed absurd leaflets. (Dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<p>Guilin: On the afternoon of the 17th, over two thousand Japanese troops who attacked Qin County infiltrated the city. There are over three hundred Japanese troops in Huangwutunwei, northwest of Qin County, and a Japanese platoon in Pingyinhu (east of Qin County). Japanese troops advancing north from Qin County attempted to seize Xiaodong but were fiercely attacked by the Chinese army, resulting in intense fighting. (Dispatch from the 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Urgent Telegram from Chen Zhimin via Express Mail <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully addressing Chairman Lin of the National Government, President Ju of the Judicial Yuan, President Yu of the Control Yuan, Minister Chen of the Ministry of Education, and Minister Weng of the Ministry of Economic Affairs: I humbly report that last autumn, due to the burden of providing security, the people suffered excessive stress, which also affected their reputation. Therefore, after the details of the case became clear, I had no choice but to write "Methods for Manufacturing Transaction Devices," abbreviated as "Transaction Device Law," in order to prove my innocence. The book was published this spring, and I immediately sent copies to famous figures from all walks of life for correction. Besides the letters of encouragement received from this and other cities, there was no criticism or slander until the "Economic Special Issue" of the "Shen Bao" on October 9, when a person named Pan Chuandong, with unknown intentions, deliberately omitted parts of the contents of the article and then misinterpreted it, even distorting right and wrong and creating confusion to mislead people and affect social happiness, etc. After reading the report, I was extremely alarmed and mailed an urgent request on October 16 to famous figures from all walks of life, hoping they would provide their honest and balanced opinions as guidance. However, apart from the letters of praise received from Committee Member Xue of the National Government, the Central Library, and the Hong Kong Exchange Industry (which was purchased by Juxing Exchange and studied by its colleagues), I have received no other replies (there are too many other letters of praise to list). I am now submitting five copies of my humble work and six newspapers (submitted to the Aviation Bureau today). I humbly request your judgment and appraisal. If it is deemed to be misleading, confusing, and affecting social happiness, I am willing to accept the punishment of the national law. However, if it is indeed Pan Chuandong's malicious misinterpretation and distortion of right and wrong, then he should be punished accordingly. After all, any creation has a great relationship with the world, and its meaning should not be misinterpreted or misinterpreted. Considering that our country's language has been inconsistent, how can it have thousands of years of history, depending on the unified interpretation of the text? If the text can be misinterpreted at will and it is considered no major crime, then our country has 400 million people and should prevent 400 million interpretations, then the consequences are unimaginable! In short, a businessman who writes a practical reference book for his industry is not sure whether it is suitable for national law. In short, all the rights and wrongs are requested to be promulgated laws to correct the public's opinions. It is here that people's hearts are not old and treacherous are rampant. If the law is not strictly extended, how can we punish the effect? At this time of national crisis, I dare not have this adventure. Because it is a matter of the people, the small one is related to the future generations, the big one is looking forward to extra forgiveness. In the district, I am humbly and respectfully submitting this report. The people, Chen Zhimin, kowtow.</p>

<p>Zhaoqing: At 7:00 am on the 17th, the Chinese Air Force raided Foshan. Under heavy Japanese anti-aircraft fire, they bravely and swiftly bombed in turns, dropping over fifty bombs, all hitting their targets, destroying many Japanese barracks, warehouses, and defensive works.

<p>A Certain Location: Chairman Wei went to Zhengzhou and its vicinity on the 15th to inspect the river defenses and flood control. He returned to a certain location on the 18th. When interviewed by reporters about his impressions of the tour, he said that he was very pleased to witness the harmonious cooperation between the military and civilians in eastern Henan and the high morale of the officers and soldiers in resisting the Japanese. The river defenses and flood control in eastern Henan are very strong. Zhengzhou has been very peaceful recently. Although the market is not as prosperous as before, the military and civilians are well aware that it is a transportation hub in Henan Province and do not ignore its importance because of the indiscriminate bombing and destruction by Japanese aircraft. They are actively responding with a calm spirit. (Dispatch from the 18th)</p>

<h3 id="e10">Thinking of Czechoslovakia and Poland <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Various records concerning Czechoslovakia and Poland still occupy an important place in world newspapers and are quite vivid. Recently, such as the restoration movement led by former Czech President Benes, about 50,000 professors teaching students and ordinary cattle farmers were arrested in Czechoslovakia within a few days because of suspected national movements; the Polish government in Paris, France, officially visited London, England, Polish people in France The compilation and training of foreign troops will be completed, and Polish warships will be incorporated into the British fleet to fight together; all these political and military news of the Czech and Polish nations are what the world is paying attention to.</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia was annexed by Germany in March of this year, and Poland was divided by Germany and the Soviet Union in October of this year. Both annexation and division are facts, but both are unresolved issues, or even judged as issues that must be redressed or can be redressed, because the Polish government still exists, and some Czech diplomats abroad still exist, which are regarded by various countries as legitimate representatives of the Czech Republic and Poland; the international community denies annexation and division as reasonable and legal, thereby denying the validity of the facts: Britain and France are at war with Germany, and restoring the Czech Republic and Poland is one of the main goals of the war. The Czech Republic and Poland are participating in this war, and the war is ongoing and has not been won or lost. For all these reasons, speaking of the Czech Republic and Poland today: it cannot be said that they are healthy, nor can it be said that they are dead; they are neither nominally dead but actually alive, nor nominally alive but actually dead, because they are in a tragic process of precariousness. This is the moment of their survival or extinction. We deeply sympathize with them and take them as a warning. Every time we hear about the recent events of the Czech Republic and Poland, we feel endless anger! Therefore, I will take a few points to tell my readers.</p>
<p>Today's leader of the Czech national restoration movement, Benes, still published a paper yesterday, freely talking about the general situation in Europe; this gentleman has moral integrity and can write articles. More than 20 years ago, he was very famous for his participation in the Czech revolution and national construction movement; however, strictly speaking, Benes is responsible for the Czech Republic's disaster this spring. Germany, which annexed Czechoslovakia, wantonly invaded and provoked discord in Czechoslovakia, and threatened violence, which is unforgivable and need not be discussed. From Czechoslovakia itself, there are three reasons for its self-destruction: (1) Even with a strong neighbor peeping, it still clung to the differences in race and belief, and could not unite sincerely to resist foreign aggression; for the Sudetenland and the Slovak nation, it led wolves into the house and suffered its disaster. (2) Benes, who bore the heavy responsibility of the country, could not eliminate domestic contradictions and did not know that the aggressive neighbors were insatiable; although he once said boldly that "the Czech government must try to avoid war, but is also determined to fight for survival", after the German army invaded the Sudetenland, he suddenly thought that the war would not be won, so it was better not to fight, cede land for peace, and hope for complete preservation; judging from the situation at that time, wouldn't it be said that he could bend and stretch, and was a hero who knew the times, but he never expected that he would seek complete preservation through compromise and be in dire straits, followed by leaving office and traveling far away, and finally the situation would become worse and worse. (3) Hacha succeeded Danenes as president, and he did not know how to fight against the war for survival. He went to the enemy country and accepted the conditions for national subjugation; he returned and announced to his people that "the German mechanized troops have penetrated deeply, and if the people were to resist, it would only increase the pain of national subjugation", which is like declaring their own demise. These three paragraphs are really dangerous for the country. Czech patriots, try to recall, regret is useless, can you not feel heartache?</p>
<p>Hacha has already sent Czechoslovakia to Germany through a compromise, and he is still the president under the control of German forces; the subjugated foreign race certainly has no independence and equality, and it is self-deception to talk about it. The living drama of yesterday and today: Germany arrested 50,000 Czech intellectuals and ordinary civilians and detained them in concentration camps, because intellectuals are naturally a thorn in the side of foreign races, and the people of the subjugated country have no guarantee. The German ordered the police under Hacha to be dismissed for poor service and the German political police arrested them. It appears the puppet president has no right to build his own power. The German representative in the Czech Republic, calling himself a protector, blackmailed President Hacha into recruiting one million Czech men and driving them to the battlefield to declare war on Britain and France, and enticed them to change the name of the protectorate to the Republic. Hacha could not obey, so he was placed under house arrest, but he still had to broadcast a speech to the people, saying that they should live in peace and not disturb each other, because the country is not their country, the people are not their people, there is no freedom in diplomacy, and no freedom in war and peace. What freedom does the "president" and the people have? Under the control of violence, they are allowed to call the name the state and the form the republic. In short, after they have subjugated the country and enslaved its people, those in power have no reluctance to have an empty name.</p>
<p>As for Poland, although it is still on the verge of extinction, the reason why the war is not lasting. If it had continued to fight after the German army invaded, the current situation in Poland would definitely not be like it is today: if it could continue to fight for two or three years, then the aid given by Britain and France to Poland would definitely be more effective with less effort. However, the entire army was defeated after only four or five weeks of fighting, which is a pity! What is most commendable is that Germany got Hacha as its tool in Czechoslovakia, but it could not find such a person in Poland. According to yesterday's Havas news agency's telegram from Romania, Germany is planning to organize a pro-German government in the occupied area of Poland; the German authorities have contacted a certain newspaper editor, a certain lawyer, and a certain former mayor one after another, but they were all rejected, and the German attempt has failed. From this, it can be seen that the invading country must have puppets, and it can also be seen that puppets really help the invasion; in the midst of all kinds of pain, no one in Poland is willing to be a puppet, help the invasion, and betray their country and compatriots. This is the supreme honor of the Polish nation and is enough to be proud of!</p>
<h3 id="e11">Results of US Public Opinion Survey: Sympathy for China Gradually Increasing, Willing to Apply Pressure on Aggressor Nations <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Anti-Aggression China Association recently received a survey report from the American branch of the American Institute of Public Opinion, the figures of which are very interesting and meaningful. It said that in recent months, American people's sympathy for China has gradually increased, and they are willing to use various economic pressures to deal with Japan, the aggressor nation generally recognized by the public. In June, the company's current survey found that 72% of voters supported the embargo on war materials to Japan, while 40% supported the same embargo on China. Now there is a big difference. According to the latest survey, the number of people willing to stop buying "goods made in Japan" has also increased compared to the past. In October 1937, when the Sino-Japanese War broke out, only 37 out of 100 American citizens said they were willing to boycott Japanese goods. In June of this year, as many as 66 out of every 100 people supported this move. The results of the current survey show that Secretary of State Hull's notification to Japan to abolish the trade treaty has been endorsed by almost all Americans, regardless of party affiliation. In the public opinion survey conducted by the company, 81% of Democrats expressed their agreement, 82% of Republicans, and 79% of other small parties. Therefore, the correct conclusion is that American citizens are backing Hull, advocating the abolition of the US-Japan Trade Treaty and no longer transporting war materials to Japan. During the public opinion survey, the company asked the following two questions to solicit answers: (1) By the end of January next year, the US-Japan Trade Treaty will expire, should the United States no longer sell war materials to Japan? The statistics of the answers were 82% yes, and only 18% no. (2) Do you support the government's abolition of the US-Japan Trade Treaty? The statistics of the answers were 81% yes, and only 19% no.

<h3 id="e12">Central Daily News Discusses Philippine-American Relations <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Chongqing: The Central Daily News in this question believes that the statement made by Sayre, the US High Commissioner to the Philippines last week, has revealed important information about the US policy towards the Philippines. The US believes that it is necessary to strengthen the defense of the Philippines because Japan may advance south. The close relationship between the US and the Philippines is enough to show its attitude towards the situation in the Far East. The newspaper went on to say that the Philippines is located in a strategic location, but it is doubtful whether Filipinos have the power of self-defense. Three years ago, Quezon, the President of the Philippine Commonwealth, said to the reporter of the Central News Agency when he passed by Changsha that the defense of the Philippines was not strong enough, so it was necessary to implement a new defense plan. However, this defense plan has not been mentioned to this day, which shows the general view of the United States' entire Pacific policy. Until recently, American politicians have regarded the Philippines as the outpost of the United States in the Pacific. The newspaper concluded that the United States was originally a stabilizing force in the Pacific. Today, it is necessary to rebuild its historical prestige in the Pacific, otherwise, the American interests in the Far East that have been invaded and ravaged by Japan will be in danger of complete withdrawal.

<p>Chongqing: Cai Shaoqing, a sergeant, and Liu Fuye, a private first class, of a certain unit of the Chinese army in the Third War Area, have repeatedly made decisions to scout out Japanese intelligence quickly and accurately. On the 4th of last month, they were again sent to scout out ×× Bridge, deep into the Japanese lines. Unfortunately, they were captured. First, they were baited with heavy money to induce them to confess the situation, but Cai and others were unmoved and scolded them loudly. The Japanese then tortured them severely. Cai and others had their hands and feet broken, but they did not yield. The Japanese believed that Cai and others refused to tell the truth, so they executed them by shooting at Shangxia Yangcaoping the next morning. Cai and others shouted loudly and calmly faced their deaths. A certain commander reported that the soldiers were loyal and courageous and unyielding, which was commendable. He specially telegraphed the Military Affairs Commission to order praise and commendation and handed over the deeds to the Political Department for commendation to show encouragement and encourage those to come.

<p>To Convene a National Assembly This Winter</p>
<p>Chongqing: According to reliable sources here today, the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang has decided to convene a National Assembly on December 12, 1940, to promulgate the constitution and establish a constitutional government to replace the current one-party government. (November 12 is the birthday of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Father of the Republic of China.) The representatives of the National Assembly will be composed of those elected by the provinces and cities. The four northeastern provinces and the occupied provinces, Outer Mongolia, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Tibet, and the occupied special municipalities, such as Peiping, Shanghai, Tianjin, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Hankou, and overseas Chinese in various countries will be able to elect representatives. The method of electing representatives in the occupied areas will still be based on the election law promulgated in 1937, with 400 people. After the Sixth Plenary Session is closed, the election will be carried out immediately. The National Assembly, in accordance with Dr. Sun Yat-sen's National Reconstruction Program, is the highest power organ of the Republic of China, and its power is similar to that of the parliaments of Britain and the United States. According to reliable sources, the representatives elected in 1937 have already established an office for the representatives of the National Assembly in Chongqing to exchange opinions and study the future constitution of China. It is said that after the date of the National Assembly is determined, the friction between the parties will be greatly reduced. (United Press dispatch from the 19th)</p>

<p>Changsha: A certain general recently personally participated in strengthening road destruction efforts in a certain location. He also instructed the local populace on methods of road destruction and emphasized the significant importance of plowing fields and storing water early to convert roads into fields. He stated that the purpose of destroying roads is to impede the movement of Japanese heavy weaponry and increase the difficulty of Japanese troop marches and transportation. He urged that damaged highways and railways be quickly converted into paddy fields, that major roads be transformed into minor paths, and that dry fields alongside the roads be plowed and hoed early, with constant water storage to prevent dryness. The people of northern Hunan, southern Hubei, and northern Jiangxi should take advantage of this relatively idle time in early winter to wholeheartedly dedicate themselves to this important work to benefit the war effort. The populace was inspired upon hearing this and enthusiastically engaged in the work. (18th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Chongqing: The Sino-American Cultural Association held a tea party on the 19th to welcome the association's directors, Wang Zhengting and Cheng Tianfang. Association President Kong Xiangxi presided over the event and delivered a welcoming speech. Wang Zhengting spoke about the relationship between China and the United States and the support of the American government and people for China's war effort. Subsequently, the association's Deputy Secretary-General and New York Times correspondent, Dou Dian'an, reported on the association's work. The association was established in February of this year, and branches in Chengdu, Kunming, and Guiyang have recently been established. A sister association will also be established in the United States, chaired by Stimson. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Chongqing: Dr. Wang Zhengting, the former Chinese Ambassador to the United States, gave a speech at a welcoming event hosted by the Sino-American Cultural Association today. He requested that the United States strengthen its Far Eastern policy and frankly inform Japan that the U.S.-Japan commercial treaty will be completely void on January 26th. However, Mr. Wang believes that while the United States' attitude towards the Far East is passive, it has already provided great assistance to China. Furthermore, this policy of the United States is consistent with its past policies towards China. The reason why American assistance to China is only passive is that it fears being drawn into a war with Japan, which is not supported by American public opinion. Regarding the cultural relations between the two countries, Mr. Wang believes that the friendship between China and the United States is due to similarities in politics, geography, and religion. Mr. Wang could not make a precise prediction about the future of the Sino-Japanese War, but he stated that unless Japan earnestly abides by the treaties it has signed, the attitude of the United States will be greatly unfavorable to Japan.

On the 15th of this month, disturbances occurred again, but the situation was not serious. Up to today, one German has been shot dead. In order to deter others, the authorities executed three Czechs, two of whom were police officers. All these disturbances were instigated by the Czech intellectual class and students.

<p>Prague: Czech President Hacha delivered a radio address last night, appealing to the people to maintain discipline during these difficult times.

In his radio address, Hacha emphasized that the events that have occurred in the Czech Republic in recent days are harmful to the rights enjoyed by the Czech Republic. The majority of Czech people are well aware of the position of the Czech Republic. Only the incitement of a small number of irresponsible elements has caused extremely regrettable events. Germany is currently engaged in a major war. It is fortunate that the Czech people can live in peace and are not suffering the horrors of war like Poland. He hopes that all people in the country will abide by the law, otherwise the authorities will take strict measures to crack down. (19th Haitong)</p>
<p>Brussels: The German authorities in Bohemia and Moravia are dealing with Czech students with planned high-pressure tactics. Yesterday at dawn, motorized units of the National Socialist Party's Guard arrived in Prague from Germany. They tightly surrounded the University, the Svera College and the Masaryk College, and set up machine guns at the gates. Then, fully armed, they rushed into the dormitories, dragged the students out of bed, did not allow them to put on clothes, and ordered them to board heavy trucks and be taken away. The team members then moved the machine guns to the school windows and occupied them. By noon, troops had entered the medical, law, and agricultural colleges, arresting all the professors and students and taking them to the Buchenwald concentration camp near Weimar, Germany for detention. In addition, Czech patriotic groups and the Sokol Sports Association were also searched, and three officers of the Sports Association were arrested and taken to the concentration camp. Many Czech politicians have also been arrested. In total, it is estimated that 50,000 people were arrested throughout the Czech Republic that day. The German authorities also stated that they will continue to search and arrest people in order to eliminate the crisis of disturbance. The German agencies in Prague are heavily guarded by the National Socialist Party's Guard, which has set up machine guns, and there are many tanks patrolling the streets. (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e27">Western Front Quiet <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 153, stating that "The front line was quiet last night." (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris: The General Headquarters has just issued War Bulletin No. 152, stating that "The advance units and artillery units of both our army and the enemy were quite active in various locations on the front line today." (18th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>French Front Line: There are currently no fewer than 10 million soldiers from the three countries on the Western Front. However, due to continuous heavy rains, muddy roads, and rivers overflowing their banks, they have become a major obstacle for modern mechanized units. Therefore, there is unlikely to be a large-scale war before next spring. In fact, there are no signs of an early offensive from the other side. In terms of preparation, the German side's preparation behind the Siegfried Line has long been sufficient. As long as the order is given, the offensive can be launched immediately. The no-man's land between the French and German lines is half a mile wide in narrow places and about a mile wide in wide places. No one is visible during the day, but at night, both sides send out patrols everywhere. There are still villages in the no-man's land that are no longer inhabited. Patrols often visit them. When the two sides meet, they immediately open fire with machine guns. So far, activities on the Western Front have been limited to this. As for the British and French front lines on the Western Front, daytime work is completely focused on strengthening fortifications. These public works either utilize the local terrain or are specially constructed in accordance with the original plans of the General Staff. In the past month, countless trenches and tank traps have been rushed to completion. In addition, heavily concealed heavy artillery and anti-aircraft guns have been deployed, and mines have been laid to deal with enemy tanks. Large trees have been cut down and placed across the roads. As for the deployment of anti-aircraft guns and machine guns, the area is even wider. It is heard that the construction of the Maginot Line is more underground than the Siegfried Line, so the lives of British and French soldiers are more comfortable than those of German soldiers. However, the lives of British and French soldiers in machine gun positions outside the main fortresses are also very difficult. (19th United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin: A statement from the German High Command said that there was heavy artillery and machine gun fire on a section of the Upper Rhine. The fighting on other sections was quieter. The German Air Force continued to monitor French activities. (19th Haitong)</p>

<p>London: There have been several bomb explosions in West London tonight. The seriousness of their nature is unprecedented since the implementation of the blackout. Near Piccadilly, two bombs exploded first, and half an hour later, a third and fourth bomb exploded in succession. A fifth bomb was detected before it exploded. The glass windows of several shops were shattered, but no one was injured. However, the sound of the explosions and the sound of glass falling greatly alarmed residents in the dark streets. This violence must have been committed by terrorists from the Irish Republican Army. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>London: A major fire broke out at the Edinburgh railway freight station tonight. Although fire brigades from all over the city rushed to put out the fire, the fire took advantage of the wind and spread very quickly.

When the blackout was implemented, the fire soared into the sky, illuminating the entire city. Many people watched the fire. (18th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e29">The European War and the Direction of Peace by Former Czech President Beneš <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Paris Air Mail) Since the failure of the Locarno Treaty, Germany has no longer been subject to any restrictions and has expanded its power. The annexation of Austria, the contention for Czechoslovakia, and the war in Poland are all consequences of this. However, the crux of these matters is not in Austria, Czechoslovakia, or Poland, nor in how the German minorities are treated. The so-called minority issue is merely a pretense. In fact, the current war is a new and great struggle. The issues involved are no different from those in 1914. The European political situation, as a result of evolution since 1915, has reached its peak again. Ideologically speaking, this war is a clash between democracy and authoritarian National Socialism and Communism. This is the same in nature as the conflict between European autocratic politics and Western European democratic systems in 1914. In terms of the participating countries, this war is still a struggle between strong countries, with one side wanting to forcibly redistribute the world and further expand its power to dominate Central Europe and Southeastern Europe after destroying the balance of power. In terms of national concepts, the crux of this war can be summed up in one sentence: a certain nation wants to enslave the various small and medium-sized nations in Central Europe and the Balkan Peninsula and destroy their national and political independence. In summary, what kind of politics and spirit permeated Europe in 1938-39? Where is the cause of this war against Germanism and National Socialism? It can be seen that various historical developments, whether occurring in Europe or in other parts of the world, have a consistent system in terms of ideology, society, and economy. All major events, such as wars and revolutions, even if they erupt suddenly, are actually like a chain, connected to each other. Tracing back to the French Revolution, although the various nations of Europe have experienced vicissitudes in politics and society, they are still closely related to the situation before the Great Revolution, just as since the end of the last European War, frequent changes have occurred over the years, although the various causes and effects are intertwined, they are still related to the situation before the European War and develop along the old path. In other words, this war, even if it causes various profound changes in politics and society, will generally not be later than the historical category of the past 25 years. What must be asserted is that in waging war today and making peace tomorrow, we should recognize this purpose, seek the right goal, and organize the new Europe based on this purpose.</p>
<p>I believe that the meaning of this war is the same as that of the last European War. The problems to be solved and the conflicts of interest to be adjusted are not different. That is, seeking new conditions for lasting peace in Europe, the basis on which to rely is also roughly the same. Based on this, if we can seek a fairer and more lasting foundation for peace based on the experience of the past 25 years, we will be able to make some contributions. If we seek without success, Europe may disintegrate, and its political and social situation may be turbulent and restless, and even after three or four decades, it may not tend to clear up. This so-called foundation for peace is that autocratic systems, dictatorial systems, totalitarian systems, and National Socialist Party systems that glorify culture but are barbaric in reality must be overthrown unconditionally and replaced by free democratic systems. The reason is that democratic systems are morally superior and more in line with human dignity. Even in politics, they are fairer. The result sought by the current war is only this. The barbarism implemented by National Socialism in spirit, politics, and culture is fundamentally contradictory to the free thinking of Europeans and the social, political, and democratic systems it symbolizes. They are as incompatible as fire and water. When one rises, the other falls; when one survives, the other perishes. This is inevitable. Now, to establish a truly new balance of power in Europe, we must first unconditionally break Germany's National Socialist ambitions, so that it no longer considers controlling Central Europe and Southeastern Europe, and no longer imposes terrorist acts on European countries. Otherwise, wars and revolutions will continue endlessly. On the one hand, Germany criticizes the so-called humiliating Treaty of Versailles, and at the same time seeks to establish a political system, which is self-contradictory in its consciousness and spiritually bankrupt, politically shameful and unfair, and oppresses small and weak nations with barbaric means. Compared with the treatment of German minorities after the last European War, the differences in happiness and suffering are vast. From this, it can be seen that the political system that Germany intends to establish is far below the Treaty of Versailles. The distance between them cannot be measured. If this is to be politically measured, how can it be ignored and allowed to run wild? The National Socialist Party system is shameless and has no morality. It is unprecedented in European history and cannot be tolerated by any country. Even if modern human morality is declining and the spirit is decadent, it must not allow the National Socialist Party system to succeed in Europe for a moment. Otherwise, the spirit of political generosity and magnanimity will vanish in an instant, and peace and cooperation will be out of the question.</p>
<p>Moreover, what this war should solve is also the national issue. The Europe of the 19th century was created by the newly emerging major powers based on their own nations. The small and medium-sized nations of Eastern and Central Europe also participated in European political life as independent entities. All these nations constituted sharp problems during the last European War, and have been most threatened during this war. However, their national independence and their own political life are not to be violated by other nations. Therefore, the Europe of the 20th century should be a Europe of harmonious cooperation between major powers and small and medium-sized nations. If this problem is not solved, then after the end of this war, major powers will still have disputes because of the small and medium-sized nations, and how can Europe have peace? The crux of the problem lies not only in the principle of national self-determination. The definition of this principle was neither accurate nor fair after the end of the last European War. What should be paid attention to at this time is a pressing and simple fact, that is, if the small and medium-sized nations are allowed to participate in the policies of any strong country, the harm done will inevitably lead to destruction, bankruptcy, or loss of their nationality, and Europe will become a wilderness. The experience of Poland and Czechoslovakia can serve as a warning. In this way, the independence of the small and medium-sized nations should be re-established and guaranteed within a new system of evenly distributed powers in Europe, so that they can cooperate with major powers in a peaceful environment, and lasting peace can be established.</p>
<p>I dare to draw a conclusion that the only goal of the current war and future peace is to seek a new peaceful solution based on the following three key points: (1) A true balance of power should be re-established between major powers; (2) A new system of peaceful cooperation should be established between major powers and small and medium-sized nations; (3) Strengthen the foundation of democratic systems and improve the collective security system, so as to establish a universal political foundation for peace. All these three points must be unconditionally implemented in order to establish peace. Our responsibility lies in following these three basic principles as guidelines, and seeking practical solutions to specific issues related to a certain country or a certain nation in Europe based on reason and a sense of honor. Then there may be peace in Europe.</p>
<p>Note: Beneš was a student of Masaryk, the founding president of Czechoslovakia. During the last European War, he followed Masaryk and worked hard for the national construction movement. When the war ended and Czechoslovakia was declared established, he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs, and then succeeded Masaryk as President after Masaryk's death in September 1937. Later, the Munich Agreement was reached in 1938, and he resigned and went to the United States to teach. When this war broke out, he returned to Europe to preside over the Czech restoration movement. This article is the first work he has written since his resignation. (Havas)</p>

<p>From a Changyinsha Dispatch: Chen Zupei, a native of Cheng (Jiangyin), resided in Qiaoqi Township. He was recently captured by the Chinese army. After interrogation by the command, it was proven that Chen had previously served as a deputy in charge of land tax for the county government. He was dismissed due to embezzling over ten thousand yuan of public funds. However, Chen indulged in opium and lust, and even masterminded the robbery of public land. He was apprehended by military police near Qingyang on the Xicheng Road in previous years, but managed to escape and hide. After the war, he participated in the puppet organization, holding positions such as "Chairman of the Autonomous Committee and Director of the Opium Suppression Bureau." Recently, he also served as the puppet "Director of Land Tax," and volunteered to travel to the countryside to persuade people. His crimes were too numerous to be forgiven. Therefore, on the morning of the 11th, a team was dispatched to escort him to the foot of Wenxing Bridge in Houteng Town, where he was executed by firing squad.</p>

After going to the doctor and having it extracted, his gums have been inflamed in recent days and he has been unable to play.

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<p>Gains and Losses of Japanese Economy in the War</p>
<p>Li Shumin</p>
<p>The so-called "gains and losses" still cannot escape the scope of "loss." Because its direct "loss" is indeed a "loss," even if there is some "gain," it is "not worth the loss," which is enough to worry about for a lifetime. Here, I would like to add a detailed review of the "gain" situation, while the actual situation of the "loss" has already been described by many people. Here, I will only state its outline.</p>
<p>Japan's economic losses: (1) Military expenses—the budget up to 1940 will cost 125 billion yen. If it is extended to the end of 1942, the current annual cost of 5 billion yen will increase by 125 billion yen, totaling 250 billion yen. (2) Japan's export trade—Japan's trade with North and South America, Europe, and Africa has decreased by 31/100 since the Sino-Japanese War, and will decrease further in the future. (3) Japan's shipping revenue—This revenue has fallen by 46/100 compared to 1938 and 1936, as merchant ships are forced to be used for military needs. (4) Revenue from travelers—Since the start of the war, revenue has decreased by 55/100. This is certainly not a permanent loss, but it will not be restored without five years of peace and prosperity. (5) Reserves—The reserves to maintain Japanese currency have fallen from 1,600,000 yen to an uncountable amount. (6) China's hatred—The hatred of the Chinese people towards Japan caused by the invasion will forever prevent Japan's attempts to establish friendly economic relations with China.</p>
<p>As for the economic gains in the war, they must be explained in detail from three aspects: (1) Raw materials—Raw materials can obtain cotton, wool, and iron resources; however, these resources have disappointed the Japanese in terms of quantity, and tens of billions of yen must be invested to develop them. (2) Commercial markets—The Japanese can manipulate China's import trade, but the collapse of the purchasing power of the Chinese people will limit the import trade to a small portion of the past. (3) Looting Japan has acquired several Chinese factories, railways, electrical plants, and a large number of iron sheets; and obtained profits from selling drugs; and money exploited from the commercial aspects of the Chinese. However, the total addition of several benefits is still less than the cost of a Japanese wave.</p>
<p>Raw Materials</p>
<p>According to reason, the reason why China has become an ideal raw material supply base for Japan actually has hidden factors, that is, the special raw materials produced in China are more needed by Japan than other raw materials. In 1936, the three largest items imported by Japan from abroad are listed in the table below:</p>
<p>These three types accounted for 45/100 of the total import amount that year, mostly imported from Britain and the United States, and very few imported from China. The Japanese argument is that if they can subdue China and apply scientific production methods, they will certainly be able to make it self-sufficient. The following ironclad evidence will make them utterly disappointed.</p>
<p>(A) Cotton: In 1936, China was the third largest cotton-producing country in the world, with a production of 4 million bales (475 pounds per bale), almost the total amount needed by Japan. However, Chinese cotton yarn is very poor (coarse). 96/100 of the production is sold as cotton cloth by domestic yarn factories: that is, the total supply of cotton to the Chinese market and Japanese export trade is no less than 8 million bales. By the beginning of 1939, most of China's cotton-producing areas were behind the Japanese front line; because the countryside was a guerrilla zone, farmers were advised to reduce cotton fields by 70/100. From this, it can be known that before the guerrillas are eliminated, the amount they obtain is only a small number of what they used to produce. Moreover, even if "security is restored, the cotton-growing area cannot be increased to 20/100 of the pre-war level, otherwise there will be a risk of famine; unless they can make Manchuria a granary to make up for the lack of food in the new cotton fields, otherwise they will have to rely on the world market for 3/4 of the cotton."</p>
<p>(B) Wool: The wool produced in northwest China and Inner Mongolia was mostly exported to the United States in 1936, accounting for (35 million pounds), or 14/100 of Japan's needs. The Japanese ambition is to be able to compete with Australia with scientific methods. After the establishment of the puppet government of Inner Mongolia, eight Japanese wool textile factories were allowed to obtain exclusive rights to collect wool. The Japanese once selected 5 million dan of high-quality wool (133.3 pounds per dan), buying it at a price lower than the current price and reselling it to the Japanese authorities, but they did not gain the government's favor; and Chinese ranchers began to refuse to sell wool, so the Chinese government bought and transported it to the Soviet Union in exchange for other goods. In 1938, Japan obtained only 1/3 of what it produced. Due to its limited capabilities, Japan cannot protect it with force or cultivate it with capital to compete with Australia until it becomes clear.</p>
<p>(C) Iron ore: In 1936, China produced 1.3 million tons of iron, almost all of which was transported to Japan, which was not even one-tenth of what it consumed. After the war broke out, the demand increased sharply, and it was estimated that 10 million tons (most of which was expected to be from China) would have to be imported by 1940 to achieve balance. However, this iron supplied by China is another disappointment for the Japanese. China's main iron ore is concentrated in two places—Longyan in Inner Mongolia and Hubei and Anhui in the Yangtze River. The former had stopped before the war, and the latter had been mortgaged to Japan in the past 20 years. Last year, Japan began to export Longyan iron, hoping to obtain 500,000 tons, because Longyan iron ore is only profitable during the war, so we doubt whether the 500,000 tons of iron can be obtained in full. As for the iron in Hubei and Anhui provinces, it reached its peak in 1936, but it was still less than 100 yuan of what they consumed. They obtained it in 1938.</p>
<p>Commercial Markets</p>
<p>China has always been Japan's worst commercial customer, that is, Taiwan, with a population of only 5 million, purchased more Japanese goods than China between 1930 and 1936. In 1936, China sold more than 4 percent of Japanese export goods; this number was still less than 1/6 of what China imported. Japanese merchants hoped that military occupation of China would inevitably lead to more sales of their goods, and they were not disappointed in this regard: In 1938, Japan occupied the main transportation lines of ten provinces in China, and Japanese goods accounted for 46/100 of China's imported goods. If only the areas occupied by the Japanese army are counted, Japanese goods have accounted for 65/100 of the market. However, this increase in trade was mostly obtained at the expense of European and American businesses. The means used were (1) issuing a new currency system in North China, (2) all railways were controlled by the Japanese, and European and American goods were always blocked, (3) puppet governments were established to lightly collect taxes on foreign merchants' goods. As a result, US trade with China fell sharply by 52/100 in 1938, British trade also decreased by 46/100, and German trade decreased by 35/100. And further reduced until Japanese goods accounted for 80/100 of imported goods (the same as other colonies). This is not enough to clarify the tragic situation of the market in this war. The great collapse of the purchasing power of the Chinese people after the war was its direct result. The loss suffered by Shanghai alone is nearly 10 billion yuan. The population of Nanjing has decreased from 1.2 million to 10,000, and Guangzhou has decreased from 1 million to 20,000. The number of homeless and unemployed people in various places is even more alarming. There are 300,000 people in Peiping who rely on public relief for a living, 500,000 workers are unemployed in Shanghai, and there are no fewer than 200,000 workers in Qingdao who have no way to make a living. Japanese merchants have indeed plundered China's import business, but their main market has shrunk to a small part of what it was before. To restore China's prosperous commerce, tens of billions of investments are needed to rebuild factories, shops, houses, re-equip machines, re-import goods, and help refugees return to their homeland. However, can the Japanese bear this cost? Then the business can only be allowed to decline.</p>
<p>Looting</p>
<p>The cause of looting lies in the consequences of their "quick victory" that could not be obtained. In Shanghai, the Japanese army destroyed 5,255 factories and collected their dilapidated machinery; in cities along the Yangtze River, they collected iron lampstands, iron sewer covers, stoves, and even mailboxes as raw materials for Japanese arsenals, and machinery and iron sheets from the Hanyang Arsenal. The total amount of iron obtained in this way was millions of tons. The remaining industrial and public utilities along the coast were all plundered by Japanese merchants. In North China, they plundered 80 factories producing wheat flour, cigarettes, water, cement, cotton yarn, beer, and soda.</p>
<p>As for China's commerce, the Japanese also tried their best to exploit it. All the shops in North China must join the Japanese as partners, and famous hotels in coastal cities were forced to sell their assets at a fraction of the market price. The exclusive rights to eggs, China's largest export, have been granted by the Japanese army to a retired military officer. Other reports say that military officers have resigned from the military to run a monopoly business in vegetables in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The most barbaric of all Japanese patents is their coastal production company. They sank Chinese fishing boats along the coast and shot fishermen with machine guns; according to reports, the Japanese Navy was behind them. It is reported that between June and December 7, 1938, a total of 216 fishing boats were sunk by Japanese military boats. There will be more news about the sinking of fishing boats near Shanghai.</p>
<p>Those who operate gambling dens, brothels, and opium dens are thousands of Japanese merchants and hooligans who came to China with the army. Their power is spreading rapidly. There are 304 places selling drugs in the city of Peiping, all of which must pay taxes to the Japanese military police; in Shanghai, the Japanese sell narcotics, and the price reaches 1.5 million yuan per month (according to an investigation by American Alco). In total, 7 million yuan was earned in July 1938.</p>
<p>The looting situation is indeed very large, but in the eyes of their warlords, they still think that it is far from ideal and despise it.</p>
<p>To sum up, Japan's disappointment in seizing Chinese raw materials, the lack of profits in Chinese commerce, and the small amount of loot obtained are the overall situation of their "gains"; these three things have led to the gradual reduction of Japan's exploitation plan. At the beginning of the invasion, a Japanese banker declared that Japan would invest 150 million yen in North China. Three months later, the Shanghai war ended, and the investment amount was reduced to 130 million yen. Four days later, Suzhou fell, and it was reduced to 80 million yen. Last year, Hankou fell, and it was further reduced to 35 million yen. Where did the capital flow? It is "bombs, shells, bullets."</p>
<p>The Past Week</p>
<p>The price of rice jumped three or four yuan, which is obviously manipulated by unscrupulous merchants. But the rice merchants are still ceaselessly talking, explaining the reasons:</p>
<p>(1) The Japanese puppets are blocking the source.</p>
<p>(2) Japan is facing a rice shortage and is coming to China to buy.</p>
<p>(3) Some even say that the high price of rice can encourage merchants to transport rice to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Let us believe it for the time being: The rice merchants are, in fact, like all citizens, part of the oppressed. And they recently hope that the financial community will expand rice mortgages so that they can hoard rice for the citizens, "stock up grain to prevent famine." Because the authorities of the concession's plan to set up grain storage warehouses cannot be implemented. This shows that they are still concerned about people's livelihood and protect the food supply! They should be thanked.</p>
<p>However, it is hard to believe that there are no bad people in the rice industry. For example, when the Bureau of Public Works initially tried to limit prices, many rice merchants were arrested for violating the law. This is a public example.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we dare not "believe it for the time being" about the above three reasons. The so-called "rewarding merchants" is even more of a joke. And for the act of manipulation, they have already confessed without being beaten. As for the first two points, there are also problems. Because:</p>
<p>Shanghai people, except for a very small number, do not communicate with the occupied areas. What are the Japanese puppets doing? It is just hearsay, and there is no way to understand. And cutting off the livelihood of the Chinese people and killing the lives of the Chinese people is the original face of the Japanese puppets. Large-scale invasion of China and massacre of Chinese people are still ongoing. Therefore, blocking the arrival of rice in Shanghai can be deeply believed. But what is strange is (1) Why have recent Japanese puppet newspapers hardly recorded this item? (2) Why are there no figures of Chinese rice exported to Japan in the Japanese customs registers? Instead, there are records of a large amount of Japanese flour coming to China. (3) The financial resources of the puppet organizations rely on harsh taxes. If rice is prohibited from being transported to Shanghai, they will suffer a major loss. The more rice from the occupied areas is transported to Shanghai, the more income they have. Isn't it suicide to prohibit exports? (4) If it is said that it is because of harsh taxes that rice is expensive. Harsh taxes should be a fact, the problem is how much is collected? And since the price of rice is expensive because of harsh taxes, there is no room for price drops after it is expensive: Why did they suddenly dump the rice once before? As the saying goes, "The weasel on the chicken coop, even if it doesn't steal chickens, it is still a chicken thief." The evil deeds of the Japanese puppets are like yellow chicken wolves: no one wants to and cannot defend them. However, the above points of doubt are also worth noting. The facts that we can believe are: the harsh taxes of the Japanese puppets are a fact; it is also a fact that they obstruct the transportation of rice to Shanghai for the sake of harsh taxes. But their purpose is to make money. If the harsh taxes are excessive, no one will buy it at all. Therefore, their tyranny must be limited. Since the Japanese puppets are levying harsh taxes, and Shanghai has no way of knowing how much they actually levy, the rice industry's bad elements take this as an excuse to raise prices and hoard goods. Since the price of rice in Shanghai is expensive, the Japanese puppets will naturally want to expand their demands when levying harsh taxes; so the price of rice in Shanghai is even more expensive. The price of rice in Shanghai, after they colluded in such a mess, rose again and again. The people were flustered, and more households bought, and speculators participated in hoarding. This is the reason for today's phenomenon. This is the reason for the past surge in rice prices.</p>
<p>As for the recent rise in rice prices, the above reasons have changed. One is that the new rice is on the market, and the other is that there is a good harvest in various places; all parties unanimously hope that it will be small; for the sake of revenue, the Japanese puppets have to reduce their extortion. This is the reason why the previous rice price once returned to small.</p>
<p>Since the price of rice collapsed, hoarders were greatly afraid. Therefore, they used all kinds of opportunities or created all kinds of atmosphere. For example, a certain public group requested the authorities of the concession to set up warehouses to store grain, and the news that Japan was facing a rice shortage was an opportunity for them to use. Recently, the newspapers have also been reporting a large amount of foreign rice imports. Judging from the situation, even if it is a fact, it is definitely not a new order. 99% of the time, it is the order in the rice shortage that was delivered this time. Because its price is not much different from today's rice price, but it is much more expensive than the price increase before this time. At the time of the last surge in rice prices, all parties did not want to import foreign rice because there was no profit to be made; how much more so now. But the spread of this kind of news can greatly suggest to all sectors: The rice shortage in Shanghai has reached the point where foreign rice must be imported." Foreign rice is so expensive, and Dumi will certainly be more expensive." The rice price rebounded, and the hoarders have a chance to survive, not only this: (1) The autumn harvest will soon begin, and there will be a salt harvest, and the bottom line in the inland is very thick. (2) Farmers are eager to sell</p>

<p>London – The Dutch regular passenger steamer "Simon Bolivar" has sunk off the east coast, with 140 people feared dead. 250 survivors have landed at a port on the east coast. The captain is reportedly dead. According to a ship's officer, the ship suddenly heard an explosion off the east coast, and the ship shook. Everyone on board knew something had happened, but there was no excessive panic. People rushed to the lifeboats, and some took a few belongings. Shortly afterward, there was a second explosion, as violent as the first. In the opinion of the officer, after the first mine exploded, the second mine, connected by an iron cable, also exploded, hence the two explosions. It is reported that two other ships were also destroyed by mines at the site where the "Simon Bolivar" sank, but were able to sail into port. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<p>London – Following the sinking of the Dutch steamer "Simon Bolivar," more than 250 rescued passengers, including more than twenty children, arrived here last night. It is reported that the total number of casualties is 140, most of whom were killed when the ship struck the mine. The Dutch ambassador, accompanied by several embassy staff, visited the survivors at their hotel this morning to express condolences and inquire about the incident. They said that the ship struck the mine twice, once at the stern and once on the starboard side. These mines were probably laid the previous evening. A survivor said that the ship was sunk by two torpedo hits. One survivor told the press that when the "Simon Bolivar" first exploded off the coast of eastern England, all the passengers rushed into the lifeboats. At that time, the captain was on deck and was killed on the spot. Fifteen minutes later, a second explosion occurred, making rescue even more difficult. I saw more than eighty passengers fall into the sea, and the sea was full of oil stains. The ship's wireless radio was also damaged and unable to send out a distress signal. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>The Hague – Following the sinking of the Dutch steamer "Simon Bolivar" in British waters yesterday, it has been learned that the ship, weighing 8,000 tons, set sail from the Dutch port of Eemshaven on the 17th of this month for the Dutch island of Curaçao in South America. According to the latest news, the total number of casualties on the ship is 265 passengers and 135 crew members. 310 people have been rescued. The ship carried 90 British passengers, as well as many Jewish refugees from Germany and Central European countries. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>London – 260 survivors of the Dutch steamer "Simon Bolivar," including those seriously injured, were immediately sent to hospitals for treatment after landing at Harwich. A baby under one year old was also injured. Some of the survivors arrived in London at midnight, and many doctors and nurses were on the station platform to care for them. It is reported that after the ship struck the mine, the ship shook violently. At that time, the passengers remained calm, preparing to board the small boats to escape. Unexpectedly, another explosion occurred, probably caused by a second mine exploding, so the rescue work could not proceed as usual, and the ship capsized. In addition, all ships within a quarter of a mile around the accident site were shaken, and two ships that were closer were damaged but were still able to sail normally. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>London – Regarding the sinking of the Dutch steamer "Simon Bolivar" in British waters after hitting a German mine, the British Admiralty issued a statement saying that the area where the accident occurred is a route frequently used by British and neutral ships. Germany laid mines in this area without notifying neutral countries, which is a violation of international law and another clear example of disregard for humanitarianism. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>London – The Dutch passenger ship "Simon Bolivar" sank in the North Sea after hitting a mine. 140 passengers and crew members are feared dead. If this news is confirmed, it will be the biggest tragedy since the outbreak of the European War. In the "Athenia" sinking, only 112 people died. 260 survivors of the "Simon Bolivar" arrived on the east coast of England last night, all extremely exhausted. 17 people were immediately sent to local hospitals, including three infants under one year old. The ship's first mate was also among the rescued. The Admiralty declared that this case is another example of Germany violating international law by laying mines in commercial shipping lanes without notification. The survivors arrived in London by train before midnight yesterday. Ambulances, cars, and doctors and nurses were waiting at the station in the dark. When they arrived, they were all disheveled, some wrapped in blankets. Police officers illuminated with large flashlights and helped them onto the cars. The women were not combed, and it was reported that one or two had sleeping babies in their arms. One of the ship's stewards on the "Bolivar" stated, "We were sailing along the east coast and there was no warning when there was a large explosion. The people on board immediately felt the seriousness of the situation and immediately rushed to the lifeboats. Then there was another mine explosion. I think this second explosion may have been caused by another mine connected to the first mine. The 'Bolivar' was a large ship with 265 passengers and a large crew. Although the number of dead and injured is not yet known, I believe it will be a significant number." The steward then wrapped his blanket tightly and continued, "I don't know how I escaped. I was lucky to survive." (Associated Press, 19th)</p>

<p>Stockholm – The Swedish ships "Oscar" and "Tourer," both not carrying cargo, have been captured by German warships and ordered to sail to Swinemünde, Germany. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>London – The German ship "Glory," carrying a large quantity of wheat, was captured by a British warship a few days ago, and sailors were sent aboard to escort it to a port in Scotland. The German crew members have been detained. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>Beira, Portuguese West Africa – The German ships "Wilfried Warman" (13,000 tons) and "Adolf Warman" (8,000 tons) had taken refuge in the Portuguese port of Lobito at the beginning of the European War. Until last night, they suddenly set sail from the port and headed for the high seas. Where they intend to go is still unknown. According to observers, the sudden departure of these two ships from a neutral port is related to the news of German pirate ships operating in the South Atlantic. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>London – The captain of a German ship, along with 57 crew members, landed at a port in Scotland today. They scuttled the ship when the British warship ordered them to stop. Among the crew members was a boy of fifteen years, holding a cat. When they landed, they waved and cheered at the residents. (Reuter, 18th)</p>

<p>Rome – An Italian newspaper stated that if the Communist Party hopes to use revolutions in other countries, or use untimely social revolutions as bait, to expand its influence in the Balkans, it will inevitably conflict with Mussolini's doctrine and the Italian army. This doctrine and army have fought against the Communist Party in Italy, Spain, and other places. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<p>Rome – The Italian Supreme Self-Sufficiency Conference was held yesterday, with Prime Minister Mussolini presiding and delivering a speech, emphasizing the importance of economic self-sufficiency. He declared, "Today is the fourth anniversary of the national humiliation of the five countries being subjected to economic sanctions. The Economic Self-Sufficiency Conference is being held on this historically significant anniversary, and we should intensify our efforts to implement the policy of economic self-sufficiency." Mussolini declared that there is only wartime economy in the national economy, and no peacetime economy, because even in the so-called peacetime, wars occur. The Italian nation has learned from history that only economic self-sufficiency can ensure survival. Regarding the existing achievements, I express my gratitude to inventors, manufacturers, workers, and consumers. However, progress must be accelerated, and strength must reach its goals.

<p>Brussels – A communiqué was issued here today stating, "In the past two days, aircraft of the belligerent countries have frequently flown in Belgian airspace. The Belgian government has instructed its ambassadors abroad to protest to the governments of the countries concerned." (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<p>The Hague – There have been two incidents of German aircraft violating Dutch neutrality. The Dutch government has protested to Germany. In the first incident, a Dutch fighter plane encountered a German seaplane while flying over Vlieland and fired at it. The German plane returned fire with machine guns and then escaped. In the second incident, a Dutch plane encountered another German plane in its national airspace. The German plane only flew away after the Dutch plane fired. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<p>Brussels – A semi-official Belgian news agency stated that there is reason to believe that the rumors that Italy and Spain have expressed concern to Germany regarding the territorial integrity of the Netherlands and Belgium are not without foundation. It is reported that the governments of these countries have made this move jointly, with the apparent purpose of assisting the peace movement of the Netherlands and Belgium. However, they negotiated with Berlin separately, not jointly. It is also reported that these countries conveyed the same message to the British and French governments on November 11. Responsible parties in Brussels have neither confirmed nor denied these rumors. It is also reported that Italy and Spain have requested the British government to grant neutral countries equal treatment in maritime trade. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<p>Brussels – It is reported that the governments of Italy and Spain have notified Germany through diplomatic channels that they are extremely concerned about the need to respect the territorial integrity of Belgium and the Netherlands. A local evening newspaper recently reported that officials are unwilling to publicize this matter, but according to reliable sources, Italy and Spain did make representations to Germany on November 12. The Italian government did so indirectly, while the Spanish ambassador to Germany expressed his views directly to the German government in a firm tone. (Havas, 18th)</p>

<p>Helsinki – According to news from Moscow today, the Soviet Union's demands in the Soviet-Finnish negotiations include two points: (1) Modify the Soviet-Finnish border, moving it north to the line of Kovisto-Ribara in Karelia; (2) Cede the seven islands in the Gulf of Finland to the Soviet Union. It is reported that Finland's counter-proposal has agreed to the second point, the cession of the seven islands. Regarding the first point, the Karelian border, it only allows moving north to the line of Ribara-Vämäsu. (Haitong, 19th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – A Finnish social democratic newspaper's international political editor, Sven Tuominen, suggested reopening the Soviet-Finnish negotiations. He opposed the view of the "Finnish Uusi Suomi" newspaper that a state of no treaty is better than an unfair treaty. He pointed out that continuing negotiations is to continue maintaining the legal basis. If the negotiations break down, the international legal basis will also be destroyed. Reopening the Soviet-Finnish negotiations is the best guarantee for maintaining peace. (Haitong, 19th)</p>
<p>Helsinki – Eight Finnish freighters, carrying a batch of celluloid and heading to the United States, were intercepted by German warships last month and ordered to sail to the German ports of Stettin and Swinemünde for detention. It has been more than a month, and they were only released today. In addition, seven other Finnish freighters are still detained in German ports. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e40">Wartime Life of German Senior Military Officers <a href="#e40" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c40" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">40</a></h3>
<p>Berlin – The "German General News" published an article stating that the current German senior staff officers are slightly younger than the German senior staff officers before the European War. Hindenburg was sixty-seven years old when he became the commander of the army. In this German-Polish campaign, the commanders of the German army were almost ten to fifteen years younger than Hindenburg's age when he took office as commander. Most notably, the current German Air Force Chief of Staff, Lieutenant General Jeschonnek, is only forty years old and has already held an important position. Since the establishment of the Prussian and German army, there has never been such a young person holding such a high position. In this German-Polish campaign, the German generals who received the highest awards were all between fifty and sixty years old, most of whom had participated in the previous World War, serving as junior officers. During this operation, the German senior officers mostly shared hardships with the soldiers. The regimental commander and even the division commander also fired on the front line with the soldiers. Officers often slept in the open on the roadside during combat, lying on straw or mud with the soldiers. General Reichenau, age fifty-two, was extremely brave and jumped into the Vistula River with the vanguard infantry and swam across the river. The soldiers were even more inspired when they saw this.

<p>Moscow – The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union recently ordered that the Order of Lenin be awarded to the 14th Cavalry Division, and the Order of the Red Star be awarded to the 4th and 6th Cossack Divisions and the 11th and 36th Cavalry Divisions, to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the 1st Cavalry Army, to commend the achievements of these divisions in defending the corps and in military and political training. At the same time, Marshal Budyonny was also awarded the Order of Lenin for his contribution to the organization of the 1st Cavalry Army. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<p>Moscow – Stalin's congratulatory message to the cavalry soldiers has been published in the local newspapers as follows: "On the occasion of the 20th anniversary of the establishment of the 1st Cavalry Army, I extend my fighting salute to the soldiers and leaders of the army. I extend my salute to Budyonny, Voroshilov, Kulik, Timoshenko, Shchadenko, Gorodovikov, Apanasenko, Tyulenev, Cherevichenko, Yeremenko, and others who laid the foundation for the army and developed it into an invincible force. I extend my salute to the soldiers, commanders, and political instructors of the army who crushed Denikin, Mamontov, Shkuro, Chesnokov, Wrangel, etc., and who crushed Pilsudski's army in the historic raid in the Zhytomyr area. I extend my salute to all the cavalry soldiers who established military achievements in this campaign to liberate the people of Western Ukraine and Western Belarus from the shackles of Polish nobles. I wish that the heroic names of Bakhomenco, Dundaich, Morozov, Lidonov, Bakhturov, and other soldiers of the army who sacrificed themselves on the battlefield for the victory of the great Soviet motherland will be immortal.

<h3 id="e42">Before Japanese Troops Land in Beihai, Japanese Planes Harass Various Subordinates of Lianzhou; Lingshan and Beihai Bombed; French Catholic Church in Beihai Also Destroyed <a href="#e42" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c42" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">42</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Bay News: The Japanese aircraft carrier on Weizhou Island has been continuously sending planes to harass various counties in southern Guangdong and invade Guangxi Province. At dawn on October 18, eight Japanese planes took off from the Weizhou Island aircraft carrier and sneaked into the airspace of Lingshan, dropping 20 bombs, destroying more than 20 houses and killing and injuring seven men and women. After the Japanese planes committed atrocities, they fled south, passing through Wuli, Baishi Water, Zhang Huang, Jiuzhou, to Changxu, and the areas along the river, opening machine guns for indiscriminate shooting. After investigation, it was found that a total of two cargo ships were sunk, eight cans of wood oil were destroyed, one civilian was killed, and five people were injured. On the same day, the bombs dropped by Japanese planes in Lingshan included two bombs landing behind a certain hospital, one bomb hitting the rear of Guanghe Hall on County Front Street, one bomb hitting Huang's residence at No. 12 in a certain park, one bomb hitting the Lianglai Inn and the nearby Zeng's residence, one bomb hitting the front of the County No. 2 Elementary School, and one bomb hitting the auditorium. The ancestral hall of Liu in Ximen and the nearby water pond near the Huang's ancestral hall behind the Martyrs' Shrine, and the road near Huaguang Temple were all bombed. In addition, one bomb also landed on Sanhaiyan, and one bomb landed on the county's dormitory and the courtyard and the nearby water pond. Two men and one woman were killed and four people were injured there. At dawn on the 20th, one Japanese plane invaded Beihai again and dropped four bombs, two bombs landed in Tang'er Village on the outskirts of the city, one hit a rice field, destroying a cattle cart and a house, with no other losses, one bomb hit the red building where the priest of the French Catholic Church lived. The bomb landed diagonally, uprooting several pine trees next to the foreign house. The French expatriates there were terrified. Another bomb landed in front of a middle school, destroying three houses. The walls of the middle school were full of bullet marks. On the 19th, residents of various places in Lianzhou, terrified of the Japanese planes, fled to safe areas at dawn. The weather was excellent that day, and there was no air raid alarm in northern Lianzhou all day. Unexpectedly, at 6:05 pm, at dusk, Lianbei and the coastal towns, as well as Wuli, which belongs to Lingshan, simultaneously issued night attack alerts. Although the alarm was issued at night, fortunately, the moonlight was dim, and the evacuation was not too chaotic, so the order was still good. It was later learned that at 5:35 that night, 27 Japanese planes took off from Haikou and raided the Leizhou Peninsula, and then there was silence, and the localities began to disband.</p>
<p>Also, since the Japanese aircraft carrier sailed to the waters of Weizhou, it has been more than three months. Although it has moved to Haikou three times, it returns the next day, sending planes out every day to attack various places in Guangdong and Guangxi. The coastal counties and cities of southern Guangdong, such as Xuwen, Mecha, Suixi, Hepu, Beihai, Qinzhou, and Fangcheng, have all suffered from its harassment.</p>
<h3 id="e43">Japanese Planes Use Air-Burst Bombs That Explode Without Hitting the Ground <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>Kunming News: Kunming's terrain is particularly high, reaching an altitude of 3,000 meters. If bombers come here to drop bombs and cannot maintain an altitude of more than 6,000 meters, they are easily hit by ground fire. Very few of Japan's current bombers have this function. In addition, Kunming is now too far from the Japanese air force base, and summer and autumn are the rainy season, for various reasons. Therefore, since the war of resistance, Kunming has been bombed by Japanese planes far less than other major cities in the Chinese rear. However, recently the Japanese side has stepped up bombing of important cities in the Chinese rear, and Kunming is of course the most important of these important cities. Moreover, because the rainy season has passed, it is generally rumored here that the Japanese side will soon use the most excellent planes to gamble on this. The Yunnan Air Defense Command held an important meeting at 4 pm on the 4th to strengthen air defense. In addition to active air defense, there are various plans in the passive aspect. It is also heard that at the meeting, a telegram from Chongqing on the 1st of this month was read out, stating that according to reports, Japanese planes recently planned to use a large number of air-burst bombs. This type of bomb explodes without hitting the ground and is specially used to kill civilians in large numbers. It is especially effective for civilians in the open air in the suburbs. In the past, when Kunming encountered air raids, most civilians gathered in the suburbs. We should strengthen prevention against this cruel and poisonous conspiracy. The meeting should conduct in-depth research based on this instruction, and countermeasures have been determined. After the meeting, according to the Air Defense Department, many of the strongest large-scale air raid shelters will be built in the near suburbs of Kunming. In addition, during air raids, the military police and strong men in the city still perform their duties in the streets as usual, which is extremely dangerous. It has now been decided to purchase large 50-gallon gasoline barrels and install them underground to provide shelter for them when necessary.</p>
