<h3>英法對德態度　堅持平等地地位自由談判　漢德森大使今日返柏林　英國政府慎重討論復文</h3>
<p>倫敦　今日下午閣議後、曾發表公報稱、內閣將於明日正午繼續開會云、衆料漢德森大使將於明日携英政府致希特勒之覆文遄返柏林、各報所載希特勒致英政府牒文之內容、完全未經官方之許可、並不準確、（二十七日路透社電）</p>
<p>倫敦　英國駐德大使漢德森爵士、携有德國元首希特勒所提建議、本日返抵此間、業經當局提付內閣討論、據此間波闌人所知、希特勒兀首所要求者、一爲收回但澤、二爲建造軍用路通過波蘭走廊、並主張英國先放棄對波蘭所提供之保障、然後德國可與波國直接進行談判、重新劃定德波疆界、據消息靈通人士所知、希特勒元首昨與漢德森大使會唔時、力言波國境內日耳曼人遭受虐待、波國並因西歐各國向之提供保障之故、態度强硬、凡此種種、均爲德國所不滿、現行局勢未便長此放任、其解決方法乃由德國收回但澤市、並建造「軍略走廊、」通過波蘭走廊、始可與波蘭進行談判、但談判期間若果發生事端、則德國對波仍得出以軍事行動、此外德國願與英國保有友好關係、彼此兩國間雖有殖民地問題、懸而未決、但不妨在數年後、予以解決、一俟波蘭問題結束之後、德國願卽談判軍縮事宜、此訊頃由政府中人予以證實、並謂、德國仍以武力爲威脅、在此種情形之下、英國仍當出以堅決熊度、本日午後業由哈里法克斯外相向波蘭大使賴秦斯基剴切聲明、彼二人並同意、宜由波蘭政府竭力避免各種事端、俾德國無從以日耳曼人遭受虐待爲口實、關於此層、英國政府對希特勒元首之復文亦當力以波國政府具有誠意爲言云、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　關於希特勒元首所提建議、國政府復文將於明日交由漢德森大使携回柏林、此間政府中人頃預料、復文內容當說明三點、（一）英國向波蘭所提供之保障完全有效、（二）希特勒元首曾向英國表示「友好之意、」此在英國亦一向凖備與德國討論各項懸案與軍縮問題、（三）此種一般性實之問題、與英國保障波蘭一項問題、不相關聯、惟在强力威脅之下、波蘭亦自未便接受德國默書之命令、與之進行談判、</p>
<p>此間波蘭人鑒於英國態度至爲堅決、德國造成慕尼黑第二之企圖、無為實現、頗爲欣慰、要之、英政府中人均以爲、和平陣綫各國、雖仍凖備討論各項懸案、但決當抵抗强力壓迫、拒絕片面性質之解決方案、德國雖與英法兩國交換意見、但若不允依據平等基礎、以自由精神進行談判、則現行緊張局勢、未必綏和、德國態度畢竞如何、觀於英國復文寄達柏林之後、該國是吾再度答覆、抑或出以强暴舉動、即可知之云、（二十六日合瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　外傳德國元首希持勒會於昨日接見英法兩國大使時提出具體的和平方案此間接近政府人士頃吾認此說咸謂、希特勒接見英國大使淡德森時間僅表示願依照本年四月二十八日渠在衆議院演說時所提出之「寬大的建議、」收回但澤自由市及波蘭走廊之一部份、（按希特勒當時嘗云、德國建議、（一）以但澤歸還德國（二）德國得修築汽車路與鐵路錢各一條、通過波蘭走廊、（三）德國承認波蘭在但澤市所保有之經濟利益、（四）切實劃定德波兩國疆界、）幷要求將波闌境內日耳曼少數民族移歸德國、拾此而外、別無何項建議、此間一般人以爲柏林方面所作之樂觀的評論、以及希特勒提出所謂和平方案之傳聞、用意乃在以他日發生事變之責任、諉諸英法兩國、俾得在全世界輿論之前、指英法爲戎首、負責人士亦謂、希特勒前於本年四月間所提出之建議、早經波蘭予以拒絕、及至此際、波蘭似無接受更大的犧牲之理、然則和平解決雖未完全絕望、但英法兩國決不爲德國威脅所屈服則可斷言、英國首相張伯倫法國總理達拉第日前所發表之演說業已明白確定兩國立塲、其不能再事讓步、實已爲世人所周知云（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英當局接洽忙　內閣兩度會議　法大使再訪希特勒　要求具體說明意見</h3>
<p>倫敦　內閣原定於午前十時半舉行閣議、擬定復文、交由駐德大使漢德森爵士携往柏林、面致德國元首希特勒、茲因此項復文、措詞須斟酌盡善、業已改至午後三時、始乃舉行閣議、漢德森大使幷於午前十一時晋謁張伯倫首相、相與密談、爲時達卅五分鐘之久、外相哈里法克斯·處務部次官勃特勒·賈德幹爵士·內相霍爾爵士·掌重大臣安德遜爵士諸人、旋卽相繼蒞止、相與進行談話、迄至午後一時、始乃陸續散去、迨至二時半、哈里法克斯外相再度晋謁首相、與之進行談話、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>倫敦　張伯倫首相哈里法克斯外相於本日午後會商歐洲時局、歷三小時始畢、外相嗣乃接見波蘭大使賴秦斯基、首相則往白金漢宮觐见國王喬治六世、歷一小時有半、同時自治領大臣殷斯基浦爵士則接見各自治領代表、吿以時局情形、內閣旋於穴時半在唐寗街十號首相官邸、舉行重要會議、討論駐德大使漢德森爵士所携來希特勒允首之建議、至八時五十五分始畢、漢德森大使亦奉召列席、據官方人士宜稱、內閣小組會議定於晚間賡續開會、擬定答案、而於明日提付內閣全體會議、核准之後、由漢德森大使携往柏林、（廿六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>柏林　法國大使古隆德接奉本國政府命令、頃於午後再度晋謁希特勒元首、相與談話卅分鐘、（廿六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　聞法政府致駐德大使古隆德之訓令、大致與法總理達拉第之廣播演說相同、簡言之、即法國準備合作、以談判方法解決爭執、但決計反對武力解決是、據法方消息、前日希特勒對古隆德所發之言論、殊嫌空泛、（二十七日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　負責方面頃宣稱、法國駐德大使古隆德昨與希特勒元首晤談之後、業就經過情形報吿政府、本日午前已由達拉第總理會同龐萊外長暨外交部秘書長雷瑞加以研究、即當以新訓令電達古隆德大使、着其再度進謁希特勒元首、（廿六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　當此時局極端嚴重之際、此間各晨報與興論均甚鎭靜、一般人咸謂、時局應付方針、至爲明顯、即抵抗一切武力企圖、同時並依據合理的基礎、進行談判是也、至外問所傳德國元首希特勒交由英國駐德大使漢德森携歸倫教之和平建議、此間各晨報似不認其爲可接受的談判基礎、蓋以德國方面關於但澤市所提要求、仍以直接行動為之後盾故也、此外、各報又謂、前途尚非絕望、和平仍可獲致最後勝利、第恐此爲「德國的和平」耳、日報載稱、希特勒元首日昨接見吾國駐德大使古隆德之後、吾國政府常局業已訓令該大使、向之提出答案、其內容係說明政府昨日午後所宣佈之軍事措置、並吿以法國雖切望成立和平解決方案、但亦準備應付非常事變、據聞此種答案、係在通吿英國政府之後、始乃發出、要之、古隆德大使奉令向希特勒兀首所說明者、不外達拉第總理日前在廣播演說中所說明之立塲而已云、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>柏林靜待英國復文　德義繼續交換意見</h3>
<p>柏林　英國駐德大使漢德森爵士定於明日携帶英國政府覆文返抵此間、一般人均引領以待、消息靈通人士亦謂、至少目前已有「喘息餘地」、時局情形、在明日之前、不致有何重要發展、義國各報評論、對於各方面因避免戰事所作努力、極爲重視、此點至可注意、此外、德國衆議院尙無召集之說、但各衆議員均留居京城、會塲即克洛爾大劇塲、亦已着手佈置、爲集會之備、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>巴黎　據德方消息靈通方面意見、芙大使之返柏林、至少可使時局之演變、稍有停頓、預料在明日以前、各方面不致有重要決定、希特勒原擬今夜召開國會、但現已作罷、（二十六日路透電）</p>
<p>柏林　希特勒元首於本日午刻、接見航空部長戈林上將、又於午後五時半接見里賓特洛浦外長暨戈林上將、按戈林上將在近日活動中佔重要地位、可於此見之（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　德國駐義大使麥剛森於本日午後又以希特勒兀首用長途電話傳來意見、轉告墨索里尼首相、首相當即提出答案請麥剛森大使轉吿希特勒元首、齊亞諾外長時亦在座、惟希特勒元首意見、興墨索里尼首相答案內容如何、尙不可知、（二十六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>羅馬　此間政界人士均皆承認時局極爲嚴重、但亦察知和平尙未絕望、此種見解係以兩項事實爲根據、（一）截至目前爲止、不可挽回之事變、尙未發生、（二）歐洲各大國當局仍在外交上保持接觸、允其是義國、處於柏林羅馬軸心中、態度比較和緩、且正積極從事調解、關於此　、名記者蓋達（素有墨案里尼首相代言人之目）頃在半官機關義大利日報發表一文、略謂、「義國業已發出聲明、願與德國完全一致行動、幷以正義爲基礎、在政治上積極行動、爲和平服務、惟此種行動、能吾在歐洲獲得充分諒解、俾克順得發展、尙非吾人所知、一羅馬民報載稱、墨案里尼首相會與德國元首希特勒在長途電話中一再交換意見、英法兩國亦復積極活動、凡此均堪加以重注、「時至此除、數千萬人所馨香禱祝者、厥惟常識於能伸張而已、世界之陸地與海洋、廣大如是、各國均可獲有相當位置、各項問題，無論如何靈要、實無必須武力予以解決之理由、此種解決方式、徒足以犧牲數百萬生靈而已」云、（二十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>伏洛希羅夫說明　英法蘇談判破裂原委　爭執點在波蘭不允假道</h3>
<p>莫斯科　消息報頃派代表一名晋見蘇聯首席軍事代表伏洛希羅夫、詢以關於英法蘇軍事談判之疑問數項、當經分別答覆如下、</p>
<p>（問）對英法軍事代表團之談判何故中止、</p>
<p>（答）因談判中發生嚴重爭執、故已宣告破裂、英法軍事代表團業已啟程返國、</p>
<p>（問）此項爭執之內容究竟如何、可得而聞否、</p>
<p>（答）聯蘇軍事代表團認定蘇聯與侵略國旣不接壤、則共軍隊苟欲援助央法及波蘭、即必須邀准假道波蘭領土、此外別無他法可與侵略國軍隊接觸、茍蘇聯軍隊不能假道波蘭、即不能與英法軍隊從事軍事上之合作、此與上决世界大戰中英美軍隊苟不准在法國境內行動、即不能與法軍從事軍事合作相同、然此立塲雖顯然完全正確、而英法軍事代表圃則不與同意、波蘭政府更公然宣言該國無須亦不接受蘇聯之軍事援助、因此蘇聯與各該國在軍事上合作乃成爲不可能、此爲基本爭執點、因此談判判判乃宣吿破裂</p>
<p>（問）關於以原料品及軍用村料供給波蘭之問題、談判中不知曾吾討論及之、</p>
<p>（答）未經討論、供給原料及軍用材料乃商業問題、如僅欲以此顃材料供給波蘭、實無締結互助公的之必要、更談不上軍事同盟、例如美國與其他數國與日本並未締結互助公的或軍事同盟、然過去兩年彼等會不斷出售原料及軍用材料與日本、雖日本正在與中國作戰、談判所討論者爲軍隊援助而非供給原料及軍用村料之問題，</p>
<p>（問）據英國每日導報某外交訪員稱、英法軍事代表團會詢問蘇聯代表團、蘇聯是否凖備以飛機及軍火供給波蘭、並於邊界駐紮紅軍從事凖備、而蘇聯則答以下列建議、「戰事發生後、立即在東北方佔領維爾諾及諾渥格洛台克、在東南方佔領勒渥、塔爾諾波及斯丹尼斯拉渥三省、若紅軍於必要時得從各該區域給波蘭以軍事援助、」該報外交訪員此說君意如何、與事實相符否、</p>
<p>（答）此說自始至終爲謊語、其作者爲橫蠻的說謊家、而發表其外交訪員此種謊語之報紙則爲造謠生事之報紙、</p>
<p>（問）據路透社無綫電廣播稱、一伏洛希羅夫本日吿知英法軍事代表團領袖、稱蘇聯與德國旣已締結互不侵犯公的、蘇聯政府認定與英法繼續從事談判已無目標、」路透社此說與事實相符否、</p>
<p>（答）與事實不符、與英法軍事代表團談判之破裂、非因蘇聯與德國締結互不侵犯公的正相反、蘇聯之與德國締結互不侵犯公的、除其他原因外、正係蘇聯興英法軍事談判因不能尅服之爭執而陷於僵局之後果之一、二十六日塔斯社電）</p>
<p>莫斯科　英法軍事團昨日乘火車離莫斯科、兩國代表皆衣便服、與彼等來此時之華麓制服金煌徽章、適成一反比例、歡送之俄軍官等即爲前决向彼等歡迎者、（二十七日美聯社電）</p>

<p>社評</p>
<h3>歐洲變局與達東</h3>
<p>歐洲危機潛滋，至人月中旬而愈形尖銳；及廿三夜，蘇聯突然與德國締結互不侵犯條約，完成於談笑之俄頃；於是歐局乃至整個國際，爲之改觀。蘇聯在歐洲，至少有二願：一願西陲安穩，先與英法論交，謀所以牽制德國之東進；卒與德國締約，取得德國不復柬進之信誓；出爾反爾，其揆一也，二願坐視資本主義國家之消長，及爲德國氣「燄所熏炙，始接近英法，但有深入漩禍之危；及德國二萬萬馬克之厚幣，放棄東進政策之保證，相繼而至莫斯科，誠信可徵，遂擺脫英法；悲歡離合，豈於英法德國間，有厚薄親疎，愛憎恩怨，顧得自居漩渦外矣。一舉而償兩願，在蘇聯爲大獲。此所以影響歐局者，吾人未欲遽以此爲促進漩渦中各國趨於消長之機運；顧得推論於歐洲戰爭爆發之日，戰爭範圍因此而縮小。蓋蘇德一環，旣得大解脫；德義，同盟國也，宜必「有福共享，有難同當」，乃英國駐德大使漢德森氏傳遞柏林倫敦間之條件，皆德方之欲求，而無與於義，然則固爲條件不諧而戰者。於義何與？事非偶然，此在外交最後序慕中必別別別有其妙用者也，不但如此，德國誘致日本參戰之可能性，亦銳减幾等於零。是以往日視但澤自由市問題爲世界大戰之導火綫者，今日至少得以推論戰爭初期，範圍不出歐洲；歐洲之蘇聯，尤不在範圍之內，遠東無論矣。。</p>
<p>戰不戰，不可知；戰則速戰速決抑或大規模之延擴亦不可知。惟戰爭初期之空間，較往日所觀察者爲縮小，有如上述；自初期演進至次期之時間，則將與空間成反比例而加長。誠以不能不戰，不能速戰速決，則國際種種可能之演變，俱以蘇德締結互不侵犯條的而愈趨混亂與複雜，使混亂複雜者歸於簡單明朗，當然必需較久之醞釀。今雖未戰，然有關次期之種種醞釀已啟其端。歐戰初期。於中國無與；次期之大局則繫於美國蘇聯與日本，斯我人必須嚴密注視於其開始醞釀之今日。</p>
<p>請以美國爲起點而伸論之：愛好自由，服膺民治，衛護國際公道，尊重條的義務；不輕棄利益，不輕棄和平，不輕棄其參預美洲以外糾紛之傳統政策；坦白熱誠而不尙權變，强毅前進，自負責任而不利用人，亦不爲人利用。凡此美德，爲美國政策之根本；把握其根本以觀察美國之進退取舍，必十中八九焉；爲祟一二者，有短視之拜金主義，有褊狹之孤立主義，而其政家與輿論，輒能克服之。本月廿三夜之前後，美國政策根本上絕無變化，然其夜亦不免於相當程度之惡夢；經此惡夢，一面加强其對於英法之同情，一面加密其對於措施之考慮。總統羅斯福氏致電義王愛麥虞限三世暨德元首希特勒氏，是以至誠，爲歐洲危機而呼籲和平；然於尊重他國獨立主權，非難武力侵略爭覇，仍不稍假辭色，此所以發揮道德信念，亦美國政策始終不變之明證也。由此而想像戰爭次期中之美國。不難得其梗概矣。更以引伸而觀察之於遠東，美國政策亦必始終如一；非可以暴力威脅，非可以分贓利誘，亦非英法動搖之意念所得使之推移。昨日某方宣傳：美國外交界人士認爲日本經蘇德條約打擊之後，今後在華，軍事上必賡續前進，外交上必保全英美利益，而美國亦將接受日本與英美合作之意願，恢復美日正常之政治商務關係云；此種宣傳之作用，乃在假託所謂「美國外交界人士」之烟慕，對日本微送秋波，其意若日承認日本在華之武力侵略，允許日本以修好美國；此其目的，乃在利用美國如橋梁，以中國爲犧牲，代英法對日本求妥協也，遑論美國決不爲人利用，，決無捐棄道德信念，、變更遠東政策之理；即在英法明哲之士，亦必不作此卑屈之求，徒見如此宣傳者之動搖與無恥而已；非美國公民之言，尤非所謂美國外交界人士及其他負責人士之言也。雖然，鑒此宣傳，可知醞釀之正在多方發展也。</p>
<p>以歐局之緊張，以非民治國家如蘇德一國之各爲其本國所需要而不得不遺棄英法日本，宜英法日本惶惶然亟求伴侶矣；又以美國之强大，尤宜爲英法日本所欲追求矣；英法與日本，爲遠東利害之矛盾而夙相對峙，今以蘇德兩國之變態而使英法日本有同病相憐之感，宜其有由相憐而相慕之下意識矣。試以按之形態與空氣：如上述之宣傳，其徵一；如上海與深圳方面之盛傳緩和，其徵二；如反英運動之盛傳停止，其徵三；如英日東京談判之盛傳具有復活可能，其徵四；如東京軍閥之故意宣稱德國爲蘇聯與日本‘相斡旋，初非捕風捉影云云，隱然爲英法之要挾，其徵五；凡此形態與空氣，旣不勝舉，預料今後且以多方醞釀而加多。夫其間非無坦途，衹須日本幡然改圖，拋棄傀儡，澈底放棄侵略政策，則不但中日間無事不可商量，即太平洋上亦必風平浪靜；而英法與日本，不復有所隔閡，亦必可爲安定歐局之一助也。促使日本幡然改圖者，一在中國堅決之抗戰，二有美國强毅不移之政策，三因蘇德政策之劇變；將使日本依然戀戀於侵略者，其惟英法意念之動搖！雖然，英法若果動搖，曾何能動搖中美耶？日本無友，英法有友，中國多友，美國則人人欲得而與友。今日漩渦中各國之種種醞釀，正面在於求益友，不善審察國際者，或得損友，或且樹敵。中國之友，多多益善，且不患無友；而英法徬徨，將母自誤！</p>

<h3>中樞聯合舉行　孔子誕辰紀念</h3>
<p>—孔祥熙講「孔子遺教與民族前途」—</p>
<p>重慶今爲孔子誕辰、中央與國府合併於上午八時、在國府大禮堂舉行紀念、到會有中委孔祥熙·李文範·何應欽·陳立夫·王寵惠·蔣作賓·陳紹寬·賀耀組·張治中·潘公展·何鍵·甘乃光·等、及內部長周鍾嶽、孔聖奉祀官孔德成、中央及國府各機關長官三百餘人、由孔院長主席、領導行禮如儀、幷由孔院長講「孔子遺敎與民族前途、」原詞如下、</p>
<p>各位同志、本日爲至聖先師孔子的誕辰紀念、中央與國府舉行擴大紀念典禮、命祥熙主席並報吿、茲就孔聖遺敎與國家民族之關係、略述個人感想、尙希各位同志、予以敎正、查古今來一國之所以立、民族之所以興、必須有一種精神力量的存在、我國立國數千年、中間會迭經憂患終能克服一切危難、至今仍卓立於宇宙、而不可動搖者、即因有此精神力量的維繋而此種精神力量的發生、乃是由</p>
<p>孔子遺教而來、蓋我國文化的發揚、民族精神的培養、社會人心的維繫、以及一切治國安邦的論理與方法、無不導源於孔子遺教、總理一生致力於革命理論、即多導源於我國正統學說、參以近代科學精神、而於心理建設、允極力主張恢復我國固有道德、以忠孝仁愛倡義和平爲立國之經、以禮義廉恥爲救國之維、以智仁勇爲建國之用、表裏相應、體用兼舉、近年來蔣總裁鑒於人心頺墮、世風澆漓、乃根據總理遺敎所昭示、發動新生活運動、提倡</p>
<p>固有道德</p>
<p>以期振褻起敝、除舊佈新、凡此種種、皆是認明孔聖遺敎、實爲立國根本、放之四海而皆準、傳諸百世而不惑、政府有鑒於此、故近由行政院特定孔子誕辰爲全國敎師節、以示尊師重道之意、俾全國人民皆有矜式、孔子遺敎得以發揚而光大、厚植國基、復興民族、今當聖誕紀念之會就特個人於孔聖遺敎中關係國家民族之最重要者、的略報吿如下、（一）孔子遺敎與民族文化、我國爲歷史悠久、文化先進之邦、至令東西各國、莫不稱羨、而其所以能文物浩翰、彪炳百世者、實以孔子爲唯一導師、其在民族文化上最顯著的功績、有下列數端、（一）</p>
<p>繼往開來</p>
<p>孔子祖述堯舜、憲章文武、上律天時、下襲水土、刪詩書、定禮樂、贊周易、修春秋、就過去典章制度、加以全盤整理、撮其精要、剔其蕪雜、使後生學子、知所抉擇、而易揣其奧蘊、此在整理民族文化上、實收了一種繼往開來的功效、不但三代以上之文化、得因之而益彰、三代以下之文化、更因之而有所傳、厥功之偉大、實有不可磨滅者、（二）</p>
<p>有教無類</p>
<p>孔子設敎杏壇弟子三千人、有敎無類、實開平民敎育之先聲、當歐洲政敎合一之際、學事研究惟在敎會貴族中可以自由、普通人民幾無自由享受敎育胡機會、獨在我國則自古以來、即學術公開、敎育機會均等、孔子嘗說、「自行束修以上、吾未嘗無誨焉、即對家人子弟、也從無偏師獨厚之見所以「陳亢問於伯魚曰、子亦有異聞乎、對曰、未也、嘗獨立、鯉趨而過庭曰學詩乎、對曰、未也、不學詩無以言、鯉退而學詩、他日又獨立、鯉趨而過庭曰、學禮乎、對曰未也、不學禮無以立、鋰退而學禮、聞斯二者、陳元退而喜曰、問一得三、聞詩聞禮、又聞君子之遠其子也念「其學術不私於已、故能普及於民聞、傳揚於後世、（三）</p>
<p>制度完美</p>
<p>孔子對於我國文化的實獻、縱的方面乃一種紹先啟後、發揚光大的工作在橫的方面、則有敎無類、定了平民敎育的基礎、而在敎育的方法上、更確立了一種完美的制度、相沿迄今、仍不失為教育之良好準則、古來設敎禮樂射御書敎六藝兼施、實包括德智體三育而無遺、至孔聖又分設德行言語政事文學四科各就其性之所近、才力所及、分別別別設敎、此較近代科學敎育方法、允爲完備、因爲現在各專科大學、多偏重於知識的灌翰、而缺德行之科、實則設學敎人、應以德行爲先、今人舍本逐末、是誠敎育制度上之一大缺陷、（未完待明日續）（廿七日電）</p>

<h3>德廢皇對英日之憎恨　希特勒步其後塵乎？　隱秘三十年史料足為今日之小影　（譯紐約時報月刊）</h3>
<p>今日德意志之元首爲堅毅宣揚北歐民族高於世界一切民族之福音者。希特勒以此哲學爲其果敢偉大程序之核心，六年以來，孜孜矻矻，再造二十年前戰敗分裂之國家，且發揚而光大之。然其以北歐白種名義博取權力，興其國家也，樹有軸心兩大幹綫，一爲義大利之臘丁民族，一爲日本之黄種。希氏已與義國完成包羅一切之軍事聯盟，對於日本，則屢圖與之作同樣聯盟，今仍在企圖之中。</p>
<p>就大體言，希氏之程序，並非新創者，德皇威廉第二世之於一九一四年興戎也，已建其基礎矣。德皇亦嘗夢想廣大之主權，蓄意東仲德國之統治，憎惡英國爲其梗阻，力圖衝破「包圍」，迷信陸海軍力，浸淫强權政治，崇拜條頓霸權之偶像，但今日避居荷蘭杜恩之凱撒，每决聞人云及軸心，輒對希特勒之程序，頻搖其首。凱撒鄙視英人，但允憎惡日人，而不予以信任，稱之爲「魔鬼」，而念念不忘「黄禍」。凱撒且以爲希特勒不能獲得所期望之義國輔助。三十一年前之今日，凱撒曾與紐的時報訪員海爾氏晤談兩小時，發表此種情緒，其言論殊爲辛辣，雖出於憤懣，且亦透露顯明之野心焉。第此項言論從未刊見報章，倘當時曾發表者，則世界大戰或將早六年開始。此項談片經德國外交部之要求，羅斯佛總統之巾請，及紐的時報負責記者之裁斷，而未公諸於世。</p>
<p>此項談片含有函件公文備忘錄，儲於紐約時報之文庫中，已閱三十一年矣。近因淸理他稿，而發見之，其內容可爲史料，且可表示醉心於德國霸權之兩大領袖所抱心理，有根本之不同，故特以之貢獻讀者焉。</p>
<p>在已往十年大局劇變中，吾人輒遺忘一九一四年前十餘年間歐洲之時事，不知當時亦如今日然，羣雄角逐，時時有爆發之處。</p>
<p>威廉二世於一八八八年繼父登阼，時年廿九，野心勃勃，目空一世，而與鐵血宰相俾士麥意見相忤。未兩年，俾氏憤而引退，威廉二世乃自掌德國之政策。俾氏嘗審愼綠成條約網，使法國陷於孤立，保證德國可對歐洲實施武力統制。俾氏旣去，凱撒幾即疏離俄國，無何又疏離英國，於是兩國乃同聯法，而俾氏苦心經營之工作，遂爲所敗。凱撒繼乃夢想海外之殖民地，而藉干涉南非波爾戰役以逞其野心，繼乃人華佔據膠州，使或海軍根據地與貿易中心點。一八九八年續對美國威脅，而有在馬尼刺發生衝突之勢，未幾，獲菲列濱區之島嶼一簇，更於一八九九年之薩摩亞會議中取得兩島，凱撒且從事興建海軍焉。</p>
<p>英國有廣大之殖民地帝國，其每年之海外貿易，數額甚巨，其在中國之勢力，日見膨脹，更在近東握有權力。自一八七四年起，德國漸成商業强國，至是在世界貿易中位僅决於英國。凱撒與汎日耳曼聯合會目光東注，而凝視帝國外一千六百萬日耳曼血統之人民，中歐遂爲彼等野心之所在點。乃草定東進計畫，思沿多瑙河流域仲張德國之權勢，以達土耳其帝國，柏林報達間之鐵路，實爲其象微焉。英國見而忌之，遂聯合法俄，起爲梗阻，蓋恐德國貿易勢力日見膨脹，政治權力將隨以擴張也。凱撒乃大呼，曰「包圍」，「包圍」而從事擴張其海軍程序。英國因而建議限制海軍，而與日木訂定條的，凱撒遂宣佈寗願一戰，而不願接受英國之指揮，此爲一九零八年初夏之大局情勢也。</p>
<p>維時美總統爲羅斯佛氏，紐的時報特別記者海爾氏奉命赴華盛頓與羅氏作一週之盤桓，而對羅氏之起居，撰文若干篇。嗣於六月問奉命赴歐，以視能吾對凱撒之起居，亦撰文若干篇。其人爲受職之公使，而轉入新聞界者，歷任數大報之記者，與通訊員，熟悉歐洲事務。七月初，旣抵德國，知未能對凱撒之起居撰文，但可邀准與之一晤。因凱撒是時適赴挪威作每年例行之海遊，乃追蹤而往貝爾吉港，而於七月十八日由其友普魯士御衛軍團指揮洛文斐爾德將軍引見凱撒於御艇，作兩小時之談話。</p>
<p>海爾氏繼乃函吿紐的時報幹事員李克如下：昨晚承皇特許，登其御艇，談的兩小時。皇甚仇英，且暢述黄禍。皇之言：曰「英國乃背叛白人主義者，彼將因與日本締的而失其殖民地。吾國艦隊之被邀往訪紐絲綸與澳大利亞，蓋欲昭示英國，此二殖民地者，乃爲白人主義而經營，不能爲背叛之母國用命也。」皇又謂渠確知日本現正煽動印度，起而抗英，事變將於六個月內發作。德國將與美國協同解決東方問題。渠與羅斯佛總統已商妥結好中國，俾中國認之爲友，藉以分裂東方，使自相仇抗。刻正在進行談判，數月內中國有一大員將至美德，其條件行將發表，而爲擔保中國之完整興開放門戶。世界今皆知俄國現正爲白人而戰，其從事此戰，殊形困苦。徒惜渠之隊伍無一擊日人之機會。日本如得控制中國，則歐洲將首蒙其禍，渠現正聯絡回敎世界，渠已以來福槍供給之，蓋以彼等勇於戰鬥，且其地位適在東亞之間，能擊破攻軍之前鋒也。日本與美國將於十年之內彼此作戰。皇言甚長，恕不具錄。此事關係至爲重要，毫無疑問。余知之甚稔，故現正作柏林之行，俾在發表之前，德外交部欲予以反對者，可以出此。同時余信皇切欲發其所欲發表之言，且欲余與之縱談一切。渠平日所聞者殊寡，僅藉宮庭左右，得諗一二。余覺外交部必將反對發表，惟余在柏林時，將竭余力之所能爲。今料德國將與英國一戰，就余評斷，皇對戰禍之速發，並不介意。渠發侮辱英國之言論，滔滔不絕，歷兩小時之久。</p>
<p>此函縱名曰海爾氏紀錄之節略，亦殊勉强。紀錄示明凱撒談話之方針，與其情緒之激昂。海爾氏在備忘錄序言中曾有言日：「即此亦不過德皇所言之大略耳，皇之心意中最注意者，顯爲英日新條的。」</p>
<p>凱撒曰：「人人了解亞洲與泰西間，即黄種與白種間，必將有何種經過。」吾人茍對此必不能免之事，盲目無覩，實屬痴愚。吾人負有保持祖宗所爲吾人造成之文明，及上帝所予吾人之宗敎之神聖責任，若予漠視，無以對祖宗，對上帝。全世界皆知地球民衆命運最大之危機，近在咫尺。第一次大戰已作矣，不幸未獲勝利。俄國爲白種而戰鬥，當時人多不知，今則全知之矣。惜哉未能作較佳之戰鬥，何不幸之甚耶！上帝乎！余嘗願余之部隊有從事此役，攻擊日軍之機會吾人能於短時期內博得勝利也。</p>
<p>足以危害吾人者非日木，而係得爲團結的亞洲之首領之日本，日本如統治中國，則其威脅世界，爲禍不堪設想，蓋該國爲痛惡白人文明者也。吾人如分裂東方，而使自相仇抗，則爲智者。此一計謀在今日之階段中，吾人必須弗容中日兩國相互團合，或彼此相親，或由此國囊括彼國。白人此際對已所負之特殊責任，爲阻止日本併呑中國。</p>
<p>大不列顚實不足齒及，英國乃背叛白種主義者，今由一班愚漢握政府大權，而處於絕對不能保持之地位。余今吿君，英帝國行將在此礁石之上觸成粉碎，如英國堅持與日本之聯盟，則余不知英帝國將如何能免分裂。私利旣由戶入，熱情之愛國主義即由窗次飛去。余知英國哥倫比亞已明白表示今必須以甚溫和之方策治理該地，吾則將宣吿脫離英國，甫非則人人皆知該處種族問題殊爲危亟，印度此際之狀况，已公然表明厭惡英人。如印人得知全部眞相，其對英人，必非僅僅厭惡而已也。印度特殊之危險，直接發生於英政府與日木締結聯盟。英政府已作此舉矣，已依平等之基礎與一亞洲民族交換尊嚴與友交之質言，一面則强迫另一亞洲民族爲其奴隸。印度對英，久抱怨望，今此種怨望已爲人利用此種恥辱之論據，煽成叛英之熾烈精神矣。</p>
<p>余今告君，余不信英國與情贊助該的，惟主持政府之愚漢決計保持之，英國一日保持該的，一日不能脫離叛變白人主義之地位。</p>
<p>威廉皇又謂英國之盟友法俄兩國對於輔助遏止日本，實不足恃。皇因此故，乃宣布唯德美兩國能勝此任。於是皇乃縱談德國與美國有種種原因，應固結友交。</p>
<p>皇於其間有言曰：「君嘗吿余，巨數之德人，及德國種之男婦，現爲偉大貴國中公民之大部分，此已成兩國間一種必要之團結矣。吾人性情相同，宗敎相同，種族相同，今日即在煽亂者夢魔之中，亦不復想像吾人之間有爭執之微影，或此種可能性。德國並無野心欲通過，甚至迫近美國之活動範圍。噫！一切終將實現。世界之前途屬於白種，不屬於黄種，黑種，或棕色種。屬於白膚金髮者，屬於基督敎，屬於基督新敎徒。唯吾人民族能保救之。任何其他文明或任何其他宗敎無權拯救人類。前途屬於吾人，——盎格洛薩克遜，即來自北歐之人也」。</p>
<p>凱撒於是言及羅斯佛總統，表示對美總統熱烈之敬仰，稱之爲賦有一新世界最優美之精神者一。繼乃闡述其政治哲學，其言曰：「世界一切大事，常由一人爲之，即具堅毅性格之人物也。危亟時代中之歷史，輒呼出一人。一切唯待大人物之出現，非至一人興起，其人心中具有如熾之信念，具有大無畏之精神，不以笑罵或爲人誤會置意，則將無事發生。是人知其所欲，旣知，即猛進以博之。……此爲歷史之途徑。大人物力能成就一切，此爲社會進步之公律。余嘗吿我民，勿以帝國或共和爲計較，當得一人担負艱鉅。國會可發評詆，國會可弗允許，國會或甚賢明，但國會並不做事。君可羅致世界高明於國會一院，但君永不能山國會一院中獲得任何行動，必有一人爲領導而後可」。繼乃贊揚羅斯佛之人格與事業，並謂英國朝貴不識其人，恨之特甚，雖英王亦不免焉。</p>
<p>凱撒又述及和平主義與宗敎曰：「在實際的事實之世界中，吾人必須爲正道而奮鬥。聖經中滿載戰績，其中數役，至有精采。謂基督敎不主張戰爭，此實誤解。基督敎何嘗反對一切戰爭乎！早期基督敎不恤持劍宣傅其信條，吾人自己，即爲被迫而皈依者。余非主張今日仍用此手段，但吾人苟非獲勝，及於必要時用武力爲吾人敎士維持道路之開啟，則彼等如何能進達野蠻之境乎？余吿君，吾人之宗敎需吾人爲用所有之權力與才能，即吾人之學識，吾人之科學，吾人之韜略是也。」</p>
<p>此項紀錄並未述及海爾氏函中所稱德皇詳述以槍砲供給回敎徒之言，惟臚舉德皇嘲笑英國，及憤英國蔑視德國偉大士心願之言論。</p>
<p>（譯者按其下詳述此項談片經德外交部阻止而米發表之情形，從略。）</p>
<p>海爾氏後回至美國，於八月十二日晋謁羅斯福總統。羅氏靜聆海爾氏報吿一切後，深以德皇對已贊揚爲喜，惟對其中數部分，甚爲驚訝，並切實否認德皇曾與商妥干涉東方之說。海爾氏之備忘錄運同函件電報及與羅斯福總統會談之報吿，均存於紐的時報館，此事似已結束矣。但後因報紙微露此事，致引起歐洲一時之擾攘，經德外交部予以切實吾認，乃吿平復。然德皇之政策仍不改變，而孜孜從事海軍之競爭，目信英國已入厄運，尤要者爲懊疑英國之將援助法國或俄國作戰。許多人相信一九一四年八月歐洲之大爆發，德皇此種情感，實有以助成之焉。迨英國宣布如德軍攻入比國與法國，則彼決宜戰，則已太晚，蓋德軍時已開始攻入矣。英國之「愚漢」寶尸其咎，後五年，此輩「愚漢」復制定凡爾賽條件，而德皇遂　居荷蘭之杜恩。今者德皇夢想建造之新大德國，已由一曾充德軍中無名下士之奧人統治之，一切仍步德皇之後塵，而逞其野心。所不同者，唯兩點耳，一爲仇視德皇所尊視之基督敎，一爲結好德皇所痛恨之日人，希特勒不特與日本締結柏林東京軸心，且助日本對華作戰。德皇曾切言「吾人賣當阻止日本併呑中國」，今日柏林對此，雖微弱之反應，亦不之聞也。</p>
<p>譯者按希特勒最近屏棄日木，而與蘇聯締結互不侵犯協定，柏林東京軸心遂因以破裂。希氏此舉，雖不能謂爲將步德皇之後塵，而與日本絕，然至少已變吏共親日之政策矣。德皇以野心過甚，自貽其戚，惟其關於日木之一番言論，其價値自不可沒。至於日本，旣失志於德，或復將與英釋嫌言好，此於其言行已露端倪矣。英國則亦不欲遽與日本失和，最近天津刺程案之四嫌疑犯，雖經各方竭力反對引渡，而英國仍不欲因此開罪日本，予以駁絕，故英日大有回復舊好之可能性，此不免復爲德廢皇所斥矣。</p>
<h3>仙女廟華軍　沖入日營　兩度攻進斬殺不少　日軍司令倉皇赴寗</h3>
<p>揚州通信、華軍某部游擊隊、十三日晚派挺進隊與別動隊向仙女廟日軍猛烈進攻、挺進隊一班、即乘日軍不備、術入該鎭日軍司令部內、與日軍肉搏、黑夜中、日軍被斬殺數十名旋日軍以猛烈之機槍包圍掃射、以致挺進隊未及衝出、盡作壯烈犧牲、但華方別動隊、又繼續衛至日軍司令部內、日軍倉皇應戰、彼此短兵相接、血戰竟夜、別動隊復陣亡五十餘名、日方死傷亦不少、殘肢斷臂、觸目皆是、日軍經此大挫、銳氣頓减、華軍十四日拂曉、乃返防整頓、略事休息、當再機被進攻、然自是以後、日方爲防華軍襲擊、連日下午四時後、即由揚調到日僞軍四五十名至仙助防、天亮、即開回揚州、叉於十五日晚運砲彈百餘枚到仙、在南灘架設鋼砲兩鬥、大砲兩尊、夜晚、則派哨在日軍司令部屋頂上、用探照燈、日間用望遠鏡照射、稍有影響、即無目標發砲轟擊、其危懼自驚、可見一斑、又盤踞仙女廟之日軍司令桂板、自經華軍攻擊遭受打擊後、發生恐慌、於十五日下午三時、趁車赴揚、翌晨轉往南京請示辦法、</p>

<h3>經政府全力維持後　法幣外匯基礎健全　竭力杜絕投資防止資金逃避　黑市外匯不足代表法幣地位</h3>
<p>中國政府、决以全力維持法幣及外匯後、基礎健全、全國穩定、至黑市外匯、已不足代表法幣地位、內地金融市塲、均已走入正軌、此外並設法杜絕投機、防止資金之逃避、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>投機造成　上海黑市</p>
<p>上海外匯黑市匯價之暴縮、全係投機者所造成、早已不能代表中國眞正對外購買力、今日上海外匯購買者、（一）日商以日貨傾銷所得之法幣而在上海購買外匯、（二）日僞以日方軍用手票以及「華興」·「華聯」·等券、掉換法幣、麥取外匯、（三）上海中外商人輸入外貨而需要之外匯、（四）津港等地之外匯投機商人、（五）上海富有資財者之外匯投機買賣、以上除第三項輸入商品需要之外匯、尙可視爲正當外、餘均與中國抗戰經濟無關、且有直接之損害、</p>
<p>不足代表　法幣地位</p>
<p>外匯匯率爲一國貨幣價値之代表、所以中國决以全力穩定對外匯率、並設有平準外匯基金委員會辦理之、今外匯之法定價格、始終穩定不變、而上海之外匯黑市匯價、不足以代表法幣地位、因中國政府之抗戰經濟基礎、已在西南西北各省、華北華中經濟、卽不能爲中國政府直接利用、如外貨傾銷輸出受統制、並有所謂「華興」與「聯券」、所屬海關、已爲刦奪、奢侈品非必需品、仍得輸入、出口土貨所得之外匯、並不結售與巾國政府、</p>
<p>法幣本身　基礎健全</p>
<p>上海黑市外匯之猛跌、不能歸咎於法幣之本身地位、因法幣之現金準備、尙在百分之四十四以上、足證法幣本身之經濟基礎、至爲健全、在原則上、法幣决無搆成黑市跌落之可能、然黑市今日之所以搆成者、則爲淪陷區域經濟特殊之故、至於上海外匯暗市波動之主力、一、爲匯票市塲、二、爲外幣買賣市塲、三、爲金市、匯票市塲之維持、以銀行爲王、外幣市塲以後兌業爲主、而全市則以錢兌及銀樓爲主、</p>
<p>杜絕投機　防止逃避</p>
<p>中國政府爲防止資金之逃避、第一步公佈安定金融具體辦法、第二步統制外匯、辦理申請事宜、第三步馬電限制提存辦法、第四步津魯漢地名鈔票准匯內地防止套取外匯、第五步設立國內匯兌管委員限制匯兌，以上五項、均爲防止外匯投機及資金逃避之重要方法、上海銀錢業、爲體念政府意旨、一致遵守、對於市塲籌碼之週轉、如籌新法如新匯劃之流通、並竭力鼓勵資金之內移、協助政府完成西南西北建設之使命</p>
<p>內地金融　走入正軌</p>
<p>內地之金融市塲、以政府銀行與地方金融當局合作之得法、亦均走入正軌、至於對外購買力、以政府統制輸出之物品交換、與友邦之貨款、再加以固有之外匯頭寸、抗戰迄今、中國政府對外之購買力、仍然自若、至上海黑市外匯之猛縮、反與中國經濟有益、（一）使非必需品之輸入銳减、（二）使套取外匯者無法施其技、戰後之法幣發行雖增、而現金準備依然充足、證明中國政府始終未乞靈紙幣政策、戰時通貨亦未膨脹、各地物價之增高、由於求過於供、來源缺乏、並非通貨增加之故、</p>
<h3>金銀進出口　出超統計</h3>
<p>海關發表今年七月份進出口金銀價値統計、進口金幣生金銀幣生銀全無、出口生金計四萬四千七百零二金、銀幣四十六萬八千七百五十五元、生銀一千四百十一元、至於一月至七月進口金一百六十八金、銀八百二十四元、出口金一百三十二萬四千八百八十七金、銀一百八十九萬一千四百二十三元</p>
<h3>上海英當局　已作必要準備　俾歐戰發生可從容以赴　男子登記孺或須撤退</h3>
<p>上海泰晤十報云、上海僑民間、目前雖無驚惶之理由、然嚴重之歐局若釀成戰爭、此間亦須作準備與緊急辦法、如世界其他各處然、故英海陸軍及領署當局已取某種步驟、以備任何不測、英艦康惠爾號載第五巡洋艦隊司令茂萊海軍少將、已於星期五日午後六時甫過、忽遽駛出、此間海軍當局聲稱、該艦係駛往威海衛、惟許多人相信該巡洋艦係駛往香倦、</p>
<p>英軍兩隊　奉命準備</p>
<p>現並有良好理由可信已往三日來本市所傅現駐上海之英軍兩聯隊、已取軍事準備一說、聞英軍東旭萊隊與西福資高地隊均已整裝凖備一切、接獲通吿、立即他開、倘歐洲得免戰事、而英軍無離滬必要、則自下計劃爲西福資高地隊及東旭萊隊定十一月間作慣例之調防、乘英運兵艦狄爾華拉號開往香港及印度、</p>
<p>英僑男子　均須登記</p>
<p>但據軍事當局聲稱、此等計劃、恒視英國與歐洲情勢而更變云、西福資高地隊其决將駐屯印度、而東旭萊隊則將調往香港瓜代蘇格蘭隊、英領署已發新通吿、請英僑男子之未接志願國民服役中請表、及望登記者、向英總領署護照部申請、以便編入、志願服役之英籍男子登記册、昨（二十六日）見英領署中待申請表之英人頗多、</p>
<p>如何撤退　頗感疑慮</p>
<p>英艦康惠爾號離埠後、泊於本港之英艦、僅砲艦蟋蟀與蛟蟲兩號、以及驅逐艦鄧肯號、香港準備撤退婦孺至馬尼刺一訊、使上海許多僑民爲之焦慮、並對戰事發生時、彼等將吾撤退、與夫退往何地一節、頗費躊躇、據彼等稱、前年本埠戰事爆發、彼等被送往香港、惟今决香港婦孺亦將退往馬尼刺、僑滬婦孺對彼等將往何地、懷疑莫决、</p>
<p>雖有準備　尙不必要</p>
<p>據現象察之、僑滬婦孺至今無撤退之必要、惟聞諸可靠方面、英當局已作一切必要準備、俾於緊急時、出此步驟、又字林報云、由於誤會之故、星期六日傅男女英僑均須向英繼領署登記服志願國民役、此說並不正確、英籍婦女皆不須登記、惟望彼等能充看護、或有看護經騐之英婦、應向英國婦女聯合會登記、</p>
<h3>日機濫炸重慶　激起民衆決心　日本殘忍宣傳果獲成效　每次投彈均無特殊目標</h3>
<p>外籍記者來滬暢述一切</p>
<p>大陸報云、旅居戰時首都重慶年餘之其外籍新聞記者、昨日（二十六日）抵滬、據談、自數月前起、日機歷决空襲渝市、其特點爲「絕對不分皂白」、日方轟炸渝市之計劃、僅循兩種途徑、第一種途徑業尸失敗者、爲企圖夷重慶爲平地、而以恐怖消滅民氣、第二種途徑、仍在進行中者、仍摧毀多集外國大使館之該市新住宅區、希望殺害中國官昌、而使中央政府之活動受其影響、當中政府公署顯已不再在市內時、日方乃循此途徑、該記者切實聲明從未見日機擊中</p>
<p>特殊目標</p>
<p>如軍事或相類之機關、日機僅結隊在渝市本身兩總區與市外住宅區擲下大批炸彈而已、日方轟炸機類如鵝羣、成人字形隊伍、飛過該區時、從事有系統的投彈、在扇形隊伍以內者、盡遭炸及、而不覔取任何特殊目標、重慶商業區要道之一、絕無軍事機關者、於迭决空襲中遭日機不分皂白、自西向東、投下之炸彈綫所擊中、聞日方飛行員出發轟炸渝市、</p>
<p>輙待薄暮</p>
<p>然後飛至重慶西北兩水滙流處之合川城、翱翔不已、時亦加以轟炸待至天色幾已全黑、然後逕飛重慶、兩地相去僅五分鐘、此舉予日機以兩利、一因高射砲與中國驅逐機不易向黑暗之天際察出敵機、一因日機自合川入渝市、業已向出發地而飛、該記者續述重慶某决遭夜襲、渠因未避入防空壕、得</p>
<p>日擊經過</p>
<p>之一切據謂、長江上游有電話交通、先行警吿日機行踪、重慶發初决警報、至少在敵機到達前一小時、日機飛行益近、渝市遂稍起擾攘、旋即寂然以待、江中船隻載客迅駛往較爲安全之南岸、他人則有充足之空襲經騐、避入就近防空壕、此種防空壕係鑿渝市地底之堅石而成、今已有足數防空壕可容渝市全人口十萬人、同時中國驅逐機二三十架分</p>
<p>小隊升空</p>
<p>繞市郊而飛、組成空中警戒綫、俾重慶中心使用高射砲、而無障碍、緊急警報發出後十五分鐘、日轟炸機二十七架、列隊飛到、因高射砲向之猛烈轟擊、驅逐機復積極攔擊、故襲擊時間較短、日機逸去、警報解除後、開始救濟工作、軍警救護車與急救工作人員來往道中、十五分鐘內、道路中</p>
<p>已無瓦礫</p>
<p>起火亦在灌救中、被炸區電流已割斷、並忙碌修理被炸壞之電綫、翌日、渝市已復常態、水電均已修理完畢、此種迅速與奏效、乃從經騐中產生、但係受日機每向平民區投一彈、即散佈一次宣傅所激勵、此種激勵、促使中國人對於以炸彈殘殺無數無辜人民、破壞彼等之家室、摧毀</p>
<p>安居樂業</p>
<p>的期望之侵略國、團結一致、奮力抵抗、此當然爲殘忍的宜傅、但渠在四川期間、已見此種宣傅達到上述之效果、蓋四川全省已因此成一抗戰之熱誠支持者也、中國境內有炸彈墜下之地、並無失收主義之存在、僅有追隨總裁繼續抗戰、至侵人者屈服而後已之絕好决心耳、</p>
<h3>日軍六路犯浦南　華軍壯烈應戰　日砲掩護步兵進犯十餘次　相持竟日被華軍悉數擊退</h3>
<p>來日軍利用新由日本經滬之援軍、在滬郊一帶、向近郊游擊區進犯、而近郊華軍亦開始反掃蕩戰、因此連日四郊游擊戰又趨活躍、據來自浦南之商人方面探悉、浦南於前日發生一驚人之壯烈游擊戰、蓋有日軍六百、由上海方面開赴浦南、於是日拂曉四時許、由南橋·閘港·靑村港·徐家橋·新塲航頭·等鎭、同時分兵六路、每路各有日軍百餘名、向靑村港附近之陶宅進犯、携帶大批機槍及小鋼砲、進行所謂「掃蕩戰」、當時該處爲忠義救國軍某大隊事先接得情報、即憑險嚴陣以待於是展開劇戰、日軍藉小鋼砲轟擊、掩護其步兵進犯、曾達數十决之多、但爲游擊隊以機槍擊退、其間曾發生肉搏戰三次、雙方戰鬥至爲激烈、自淸晨開始、相持至是夜十時許、游擊隊利用夜戰、始得將進犯日軍擊退、是役雙方均有相當死傷、並聞該部李大隊長、已由華方軍事當局擢升爲支隊長、</p>
<p>日軍進擾　欽公塘東</p>
<p>浦東川沙日軍植弘部隊、　日由徐鴻發僞「軍」引導、由上川路終點祝橋鎮出發、進擾欽公塘以東游擊隊根據地、尙有某小隊部傳達處軍官某、單身不敵、致被戳斃、爲國捐軀、日僞軍搜尋大隊游擊隊未獲、深恐中伏、急切退回祝橋、</p>
<p>雙方均用　機槍掃射</p>
<p>詎當晚游擊隊大軍向祝橋進發、三面包圍進攻、來勢殊猛、雙方均用機槍掃射、日軍並頻頻開放小鋼砲示威、華軍避過砲火、匍匐前進、雙方展開肉搏戰、因該鎭留駐日軍僅有三四十名、僞「軍」百餘名、更無戰鬥力、在華軍五六百名包圍下、放棄祝橋、狼狽敗退、</p>
<p>日軍西竄　祝橋克復</p>
<p>正圖退回川沙、途經鄧家碼頭及江鎭聞、又遇游擊隊攔住退路、兩面夾擊、傷亡頗衆、斜刺向西落荒而走、不辨方向、亂竄亂逃、華軍復從後緊追、直至天明後、始行捨棄、其中一都份汚泥滿身之殘敗兵、竟逃至南川邊境之樂安鎭唐墓橋張江柵各鎭、是役華軍大獲勝利、而祝橋鎭亦被克復、</p>

<h3>工部局舉辦　工廠安全訓練班</h3>
<p>— 粟一</p>
<p>受訓學員一律免費　希望機匠踴躍參加</p>
<p>公共租界工部局工業科最近決定舉辦「工廠工業常識及安全訓練班」，全是爲了力求界內工業土的安全起見，它的目的：矯正工業上的一切誤點；灌輸工業基本常識；並增加工作效率。該訓練班定於九月一日起開始授課，受訓學員一律免費。</p>
<p>工業上的安全確是十分重要，上海雖形成孤島；然界內的工廠反比戰前增加，這是事實。誰都明白，工廠機械的駕馭不得當，往往會肇起大禍。不久前工部局舉行「安全第一」運動，着重在行的方面；現在舉辦工業常識安全訓練班，却也符合這運動的宗旨哩。筆者爲要知道關於這訓練班的一些情形起見，特地抽空往訪交通大學敎授胡筠笙先生，他是工部局指定的工程師。筆者一一向他詢問，承他在百忙中明白的告訴出。</p>
<p>去年曾舉辦過一决訓練班，那時訓練的學員是屬於工廠管理的拿摩溫（工頭），人數百餘人。這决舉辦的是第二屆訓練班，不過本屆訓練的學員，先從製造廠家的裝製匠着手，以後再從事於火伕的訓練，這種火伕訓練，過去已有七决。本屆訓練的門類比往年多，講授的科目分：（一）各式蒸汽鍋爐的設計；（二）製造蒸汽鍋爐及改進歷來的誤點；幫（三）實騐電焊工程（四）機械工塲之常識與管理；（五）機械裝置與動力之傅動；（六）實騐電氣工程及其裝置法；（七）機械製圖。對於說明機械構造，用電影機放映於銀幕，使容易了解。授課的時期共十七個星期，每週二五，各授一次，時間下午七時半至九時半。担任授課的敎員有胡筠笙，金芝軒，嚴礪平，黃啟羅等，他們是工部局核准的工程師，擔任講授是義務的。學員受訓考試及格，而中途並不缺課者，由工部局發給證明書，以示獎勵之意。</p>
<p>在工業安全中最應注意到的，要算是鍋爐。若果爐胆不堅實，和火伕不注意規定的汽壓使用，便會發生爆炸，以致人命死傷，像這類事件，一年中總有多起發生。如戰前某銀行爐子間鍋爐爆炸，飛穿屋頂，震坍隣屋的厚牆。幸發生在淸晨，死傷不多！這種爆炸簡直來得可怕，突然其來的發生，好似天空擲下的巨型炸彈，工部局工業科爲减少這事件的發生，數年前就規定工廠之有鍋爐者，每年必須檢騐一决，發現不滿意之處，着業主僱工修理；如已不合格，即予取締。此外規定使用汽壓磅數，使火伕牢牢記住。</p>
<p>據胡先生說，目前租界內鍋爐總數，估計在七百五十具以上，其中半數係自去年五月起至今年一年內加添出來的。使用鍋爐的廠家，以染坊，織造廠，紗絲廠爲最多，大多用爲發動原動力。此等工廠，早已開始檢騐。此外旅館，浴室，也利用鍋爐生水汀和熱水，但現尙未着手進行檢騐。</p>
<p>擔任檢騐工作的，是工部局核准的工程師。現在界內開業的計華籍有九人，西人十餘。工程師縝密檢騐後，做報吿呈工部局工業科備案。這裹要說明的，工部局工業科辦理這手續，完全是服務性質，不收一些分文的。至於工程師則酌收手續費，普通鍋爐每具取檢騐費五十元。聞九月一日起，在百物漲價聲中，檢騐費也耍漲起來了！</p>
<p>從租界內那許多鍋爐看來，假如管理的人沒有經騐和常識，時時刻刻有爆炸的可能，就要危及界內居民生命的安全。所以工部局這决舉辦「工廠工業常識及安全訓練班」，確有它的重大意義値得我們注意和讚同。聞報名地點爲工部局六〇二房間工業科（不是上决報上發表的報名地點）。各工廠爲工業上的安全計，和本身工作效率起見，應多選工匠踴躍報名參加！</p>

<p>衣食住行</p>
<h3>推行麺食運動</h3>
<p>— 茫茫</p>
<p>米價不斷的高漲，使一些窮苦的老百姓都感受到生之威脅。搶米之風的越來越盛，是說明了他們已逼得無路可走。再逼下去，也許會比搶米更凶的事發生。社會的安寗，也就越發不能維持了。</p>
<p>怎麼樣才能解决這恐慌呢？一般的說來，惟有（一）工部局應以實力來消除從內地運米到上海來的半途的把持；（二）切實肅淸囤戶；（二）提高勞力的酬報。至於購買西貢米以資調劑，在這外匯暴縮的當兒，實在不是一個好的辦法。照過去的一二個月的情形看來，上述各點，一時决難做到的。</p>
<p>然而，迫切而又嚴重的民生問題，不容許再拖延下去。那麼，「推行麵食運動」，在無可奈何的情形下，也頗有一點「救急」的價値。</p>
<p>也許會有人反對這個主張，他們所持的理由一定是：「南方人吃慣米，吃不慣麵。」這句話固然不錯，可是，萬一要是米沒有了，怎麼辦呢？到那時，還不是祇能忍痛不吃米。現成的例子離眼前還不遠，八一三後一度白米斷絕，人們還不是硬着頭皮吃麵食。可見得究竟「吃不慣事小，餓死事大」啊！</p>
<p>自然，麵食的做不慣與吃不慣，是不容吾認的；其實，能够做得慣，今天做麵條，火燒，明天做薄餅，饅頭，天天換換口味，也就可以吃慣的。</p>
<p>怎麼樣做麵食？這是一項技術問題，而上海人會這項技術偏又這麼少。要解决這困難，自然得一步步做起來。就我個人想到的，可以作以下幾種嘗試：</p>
<p>（一）報上多介紹做過麺食的常識，如做饅首，在多少量的粉上放多少酵粉，做餅要放多少鹹？</p>
<p>（二）包飯作可部分改用麵食，因爲二三十元一客飯，大多數人已感覺担負困難；能改用麵食，减低價格，使吃者减輕負担，而自己營業範圍也可因而擴大。小飯店也不妨試辦。</p>
<p>（三）家庭自做，如果不懂做法，不妨來一下「消費合作」，一個宅子內聯合請一個做麵食的短工（祗要在午飯和晚飯前工作，能够避免和該工人原來工作時間衝突最好，因爲酬報可以輕些），依决掉換花樣，粉各自備。或以數家合作聘一麵食工人也可。至自己學會後，可自做。</p>
<p>（四）折中的辦法，可以一頓米，一頓麵。</p>
<p>能够忍耐一下，習慣會慢慢兒養成的。而麵食普遍之後，米的消耗量减少，米價也會低下去的。另外，因爲麵食的較爲簡單，柴，油，醬，菜，……也可省去不少。</p>
<p>不過，米的前車之鑒不得不顧到，就是說在麵食普遍後，麵粉的價値難保不漲，這個有待於工部局的設法，因爲現有存麵足供二三月之用，工部局能够收購平賣，於貧民的生計，就功德無量了。</p>
<h3>名人之衣</h3>
<p>— 念雲</p>
<p>德高望重的林主席，不论在办公或休息，总是穿着長袍的；他在春天喜穿藍色的薄棉袍，在夏天就是白色的夏布長衫，到秋天即穿藍綢的薄絲棉袍，入冬則穿羊皮袍，有時還加上一襲黑呢大呢。</p>
<p>我們的領袖蔣總裁，平時喜穿中山裝和長衫，有很少的時候，他是穿着簡便的軍裝；在炎夏一季內，他總是穿一件夏布長衫；總之，他的衣服是極平民化的。</p>
<p>中央軍事委員會副委員長馮玉祥將軍，生性儉樸，不喜穿長袍及絲織品；居常總是穿着短衣，允其是在冬天，一襲短布襖，一條布腰帶，看去眞好似一個村漢；某年，馮氏入京，有李烈鈞將軍贈以天藍綢長袍及玄色緞短褂一套，馮氏致祭胡漢民，及中全會開幕，謁中山陵，這三大典禮中，就是穿李將軍所贈的袍褂而去的。</p>
<h3>閒話手帕</h3>
<p>— 沈錫身</p>
<p>手帕的效用是拂拭涕唾，揩擦汗沫，所以不論男子，女子，老人小孩，都少不得要備一條；尤其是在出外或宴會的時候，假使忘記携帶你的手帕，那一定要感到非常的不便哩！</p>
<p>從前一般人所用的手帕，大概多是白色的；近年來則盛行各種不同顏色的手帕，紅黄蓝綠，五色繽紛，有織成方格或長條的，也有印着各色人物花卉的，更有刺　極爲精美的，可以隨着自己的心理，而揀選認爲最愜意的花樣，但手帕的質料總不外綢的和布的兩種；（沒有見過毛織的手帕）不過尺寸却有大小的不同，大的男子都喜歡用較大的尺寸，表示落落大方，女人都喜歡用較小尺寸，覺得玲瓏而便利。</p>
<p>手帕除了供作揩拂之用外，還可以用作粧飾品，像一般摩登靑年，常有一條精美的小手帕，半露在西裝的左面胸袋上，這條手帕常然不是作爲揩拭用的了。</p>
<p>以手帕餽贈親友情侶，留作紀念，似乎能表示一種深長的意義！還有常你的至戚或密友，行將别你遠行之際，而你在輪埠或車站送行的一剎那！別恨離愁，萬般無奈，汽笛一聲，伊人去矣！這時祇得把手中的帕兄高舉飛揚，以表借別之意，所謂「黯然魂銷者，惟別而已矣！」這却又是手帕的另一種作用了！</p>
<h3>步行</h3>
<p>— 新良</p>
<p>從前，當我在中學校裏念書的時候，因爲午膳是寄在校裏吃的緣故，因此飯後就有一小時多的空暇，這一個多小時，把牠用在讀書上吧，實在是太無味了，把它來放在拍球以及其他各項的運動上呢，好像飯後立刻就劇烈跳躍，對於自己的身體，又嫌太不安全。所以，當時的我往往就的集了兩三個知己的朋友，吹吹口琴，或者就往外灘公園去散步消遣（我的母校與外灘公園是很近的）。</p>
<p>的確，這一小時餘的步行，使我的身心方面，都受到了非常的愉快與舒服，到了現在，這種步行，由於職務的關係，却終於是不可得了。</p>
<p>閑散的，寫意的步行，它非但能够使我們疲倦的頭腦重新再淸醒過來，幷且，它還可以使我們的身體，得到一種運動（不是劇烈的），我們的肌肉因此而可以發達，我們的血液循環因此而可以通暢畅……允其是在飯後，我們不應該劇烈跳躍，不應該埋頭用功，如果隨便邀集了三四知己，共同地緩步作遊，那結果的益處，眞是非筆墨所能形容一二的。</p>
<p>有許多人，他們不知道步行的重要與樂趣，他們只要兩脚一跨出鬥，就好像非車子不能够走路，他們推託路遠，天氣太熱，身體不好……等等，以爲坐車子不步行的理由，但是在實際上，我們却須曉得：步行是絕對於身心有益的，有時候，雖然是剛値火伞高張，熱得非凡的辰光，或者路實在是太遠的時候，那末，坐一兩决車子，當然也不能不應該。但例如：你在淸早出來的當兒，那時候，天氣是不很熱的，空氣是很新鮮的，所以即使路遠些，只要你早出來一會兒，你是很可以以步行走至辦公的地方的。</p>
<h3>醫治蚊咬的特效品</h3>

<p>炎热的秋天，我们仍欢喜裸着腿子，偏远有讨厌的蚊蟲專來襲擊我們，給它可幾口，也就罷了；却叉那般癢，如果一個不留神將皮膚抓破了上少不得要潰爛，弄得脚腿上，留上不少疤痕，穿了短統襪，更覺難看；現在介紹一種價格非常便宜的藥品，用它搽在創口上立即可以止癢，那末白白的腿上，永不會有難看的疤痕了！</p>
<p>所說的特效藥，是一種極臭的藥品呌氨，是淡黄色水溶液，俗稱阿摩尼亞，臭雖臭，但有比花露水更顯著的功效，我們可以在買來的花露水中注入幾點阿摩尼亞，旣可避去觸鼻的臭味，叉可增加花露水的功效。市上所售的林文烟花露水所以比其他牌子有效騐，就是因爲它含有少量的阿摩尼亞，不過含有阿摩尼亞的花露水，多少總有些臭味，非擱上二三年不能消失，因此國產花露水不肯和以阿摩尼亞是怕這批出品要擱二三年的利錢。我們目的在止癢，少許有些臭味也沒有大碍；好在一搽到脚上，它就會蒸發掉，决不會把香腿弄臭的！</p>

<h3>露台屋寫真</h3>
<p>— 陳亮</p>
<p>何謂露台屋」？即利用露台所搭造之房屋也。有句俗語，呌「借天不借地」，利用露台，當屬「借天」的意思。此種露台屋，前已有之，於今允多罷了。孤島人口激增，住的問題，解決爲難。自不得不窮思極想，此固由於二房東謀利心重，要亦補救居屋荒之一道，似未可厚非也。</p>
<p>普通「露台屋」的搭蓋，可分兩種，一種是加工道地，「美輪美奐」的。一種是因陋就簡，聊避風雨者。前者雖無鋼骨水泥，却亦磚砌粉飾，豎柱上樑，入其室，固不知此身已在「樓外樓」。是項「露台屋」廣闊長度，相彷彿於亭子間，惟三而臨窗，光錢充足，空氣流通。夏天則凉風習習，冬天有陽光普照，冬暖夏凉，亭子間又將自嘆勿如。且也，「樓外樓」翼然獨處，與前樓好婆，後樓阿姨，亭子間嫂嫂……相隔絕，省却不少麻煩，避免偶因細故引起的小衝突，如超脫世俗，淸靜無比。</p>
<p>若論租金，在這「寸金地」勢口，這樣的露台屋不見得會便宜，按月二十塊錢左右，房東已算平心出租的了。人口少，愛好淸靜的，這種露台屋，却也非常相宜，不過有孩子的人家不能住，否則一不小心，在狹小的扶梯上滾一個「倒栽葱」，那可不是玩的，小性命的保障堪虞。住「露台屋」還有一種便宜，就是聽到什麼地方閙『火警』之類，別人家都耍跑出門去瞧熱鬧，這裏只要臨窗一眺，便瞭若指掌了。可是萬一不幸亂子就出在自家門堂子裏，那麼這「露台屋」裏住戶的危險性，就比任何一處爲大了。有利必有弊，天下原無絕對性的事物。</p>
<p>職是之故，利用露台搭屋，倒不是隨便可以施行的，須獲得警務當局的允許，吾則，即使新屋落成，爲公衆安全計，亦必限令拆除。不過有些衖堂房子因陋就簡搭着的「露台屋」還是觸目皆是，舊木板充牆壁，銹鉛皮爲屋頂，有行灶面無烟囱，木板上打個窟窿算是窗戶，炊烟就從窗戶裏冒出，雨天漏水，往往外面大雨，屋中小雨，這樣像艒艒船的「露台屋」，租金自然要便宜得多，其住戶不外乎拉老虎車，馬路小工，碼頭槓夫……這等苦力階級和肩挑貿易的小販們。這年頭兒上海的「住」，確屬爲難，在小小的一幢房子裏，就感覺得「五花八門」了。</p>

<h3>交换支票（卽撥款單）止付問題</h3>
<p>— 穆深思</p>
<p>吾國使用票據，遠在各國之先，但其名稱每不一致，處理手續亦多紛歧，此藍由於吾國昔無票據法之規定，資爲遵循故也。獨其對於信用一端，素極重視，並不因之而减色，且多良好成績足述。試觀昔日上海之「莊票」，係入園之滙劃莊（即錢業公會會員錢莊）所出，信用之佳，視同現金，中外商人莫不樂於收受，良以莊票執票人享有最優先之權利，設或發行錢莊發生倒閉情事，莊票流通在外者，無論到期與吾，概由錢業公會立即集款，予以十足兌付，從未使執票人受有絲毫損失。曾有譽稱莊票爲「金蝴蝶」者，具見其受人歡迎之深切也。</p>
<p>民元以來銀行勃興，率皆出立「本票」流通市塲，然不若莊票之受人歡迎。往昔外籍銀行對於進口商之出貨，祗限受莊票，即其明證。推原其故，厥有二端，錢莊爲合夥組織，負無限責任，而銀行爲有限公司組織，組織上之不同，其一也；莊票執票人享有最優先之權利，而銀行本票概以普通債權視之，債權上之有別，其二也。迨後在某錢莊淸理時，財部因鑒於莊票執票人享有最優先權，故每易滋生莊夥將有關係存款預出莊票之流弊，對於全體債權，殊欠公允，乃決然取締之，即將莊票加入普通债權處理。此後銀行本票遂與莊票同等通用，不再遭受歧視矣。</p>
<p>在目前上海市塲，莊票與銀行本票皆不多觀，所流通者率皆交「換支票」，亦即昔日「撥款證」之化身，因其爲「交換銀行」所簽發之支票，故稱爲「交換支票」。按「交換支票」發行，錢莊方面概由「錢庫」簽發，銀行方面則由各會員銀行個別簽發，均向「票據交換所」轉帳，此爲銀錢業進一步合作—集中交換—之好現象也。考「交換支票」之發行方式，可分二種：一爲存戶提取存款，或持存戶支票請求掉換本票而簽發者，可視之爲「本票」或莊票」；二爲持支票或本票請求兌付而簽發者，則當視之爲「劃條」。「交換支票」之發行，不外上述二途，是則「交換支票」本質，非爲「信用籌碼」之「本票」，即屬「支付工具」之「劃條」，殆無疑義矣。</p>
<p>復考「交換支票」之稱爲「支票」而不稱「本票」，或「劃條」，蓋因「本票」與「劃條」，援例均須黏貼印花，在此非常時期，更須倍之，今稱「支票」，則可獲得免貼之優遇。是故一交換支票」之身份，實際上與「本票」或「劃條」無別，特以節省印花之故，始名之曰「支票」。收受「交換支票」者，祗須認識支票之非出於僞造，及注意發行銀行之信譽，（即該行在最短期間不致有發生倒閉之虞），已獲得健全之保障，決不致發生退票情事。目前「交換支票」已普遍流通，轉輾授受，博得社會之歡迎與信任，與昔日之莊票無異，良有以也。</p>
<p>殊不知事實與理論相反，「交換支票」因貿然止付而發生糾紛者，不一而足，此種莫須有之糾紛，設不急謀合理之解決，對於銀行票據之信用，影響頗巨，決非金融前途之福，殊有加以研討之價値。惟在研討之先，筆者首當聲明立塲，一則對於任何行莊，絕無惡意之攻擊，再則並不代人作偏面之辯護，僅本拋磚引玉之旨，作法理上之商榷，尙希金融界賢達，進而敎之。</p>
<p>「交換支票」之發行方式及其本質，已見上述，是以「交換支票」旣為銀行所簽發，無論其為為「支付工具」或為「信用籌碼」，因發票人負有票據債務責任，視之為「銀行本票」，固屬至當。「交換支票」之身份，旣獲確定，則其信用程度，不難估量之。就已往之習慣言，銀行本票與錢莊莊票，祇須並非出於偽造，及發票行莊不必發生倒閉情事，則本票與莊票當有十足兌現之保障，除執票人因被竊或受騙聲請掛失止付外，未聞發票行莊有貿然止付退票情事發生。或許本票與莊票爲「允諾式」票據，現行之「交換支票一則爲「委託式」票據，殊不知票據方式雖不盡同，然其發票承諾兌付之性質，固無二致也。再就法律言，「交換支票」因其印有「支票」字樣，依法當以支票視之，殊不知支票為「支付證券」，故注重資金關係，限於見票即付，（見票據法第一二四條），今銀行爲適應社會需要，簽發「遠期交換支票」，以作「信用簽碼」，具有信用證券性質，視爲「本票」，亦無不當。更無論其爲「支票」或「本票」，發票銀行承諾簽發於先，自當負責兌付於後，蓋因票據一經簽發，發票人即處於主債務人之地位，應負無條件擔任支付之責任也。執票人直接由發票銀行取得，固無論矣。即或由轉輾授受而來，祇須合法取得，即屬「善意執票人」，其使用票據之權利，自有法律爲之保護。退言之，即認爲「交換支票」爲普通支票，按票據爲「無因證券」，依票據法第十條規定：「票據債務人不得以自己與發票人或執票人之前手間所存抗議之事山對抗執票人……」。復按票據法施行第六條規定：「票據債務人認執票人有詐欺惡意或重大過失時應負舉證之責」。如是「交換支票」之發票銀行，於情於理，均不得任意止付，實彰彰明甚矣。</p>
<p>或許吾國本有「照票」與「保付」二項手續，對於「交換支票」有必要，設不履行，執票人咎由自取，殊不知「照票」手續本爲執票人享有之權利，而決非其應盡之義務，執票人祇須能辨知其爲眞票，即可不必照票，若論票據有無糾葛，祇須執票人合法取得，已屬「善意執票人」，自有法律爲之保護，（見票據法第十條）。至於「保付」手續亦非必需，祇須信任發票銀行不致簽發「空頭支票」，更不致無故止付，即毋庸請求「保付」，徒費手續也。是故上述二點均不足以祛除「交換支票」之任意止付而退票之責任」。允有進者，目前匯劃貼現盛行，貼水極度高漲，形成今日之嚴重問題，竊考經營匯劃貼現者，旣非正式之銀行或錢莊，均爲新興之銀號或錢兌莊，信用薄弱，資力有限，其能經營偌大之貼現交易者，概乞靈於少數銀行或錢莊之融通票據，吾則，設無票據融通，居中調劑，決難完成其交易，因無以取信於人也。在銀行錢莊方面，融通票據，概以「交換支票」與之，認爲「票面透支」無關重要，設或商借者有背信失的情事發生，儘可予以止付，作爲最後之保障，蓋貸與者係屬「支票」故也，此項幼稚觀念，不値識者一笑。曾有以貼現得來之一交換支粟」，持向發票銀行請求照票，遭該行托言即期票據而拒絕照票，以作止付退票之餘地，足證抱錯誤之成見也。惟其抱持此項錯誤觀念，故對於融通票據，不加重視，萬一商借者遭遇被刦或受騙情事，本身又無力賠償，銀行亦以爲祇須予以止付退票，即可嫁禍於最後之執票人，其見解之荒謬，一至於此！故筆者曾謂全國少數銀行誤認「交換支票」之任意止付爲合理，始足釀成今日貼水高漲之在瀾，非溢詞也。</p>
<p>復念「交換支票」在今日流通頗廣，實為現行票據之中心，在社會方面，一致收受，視同銀行本票或莊票，而在銀行方面，反有少數銀行持有錯誤觀念，自喪信用，誠有加以矯正之必要。否則，銀行票據，誰敢收受，此後票據之效用，以及銀行之信譽，勢將不堪設想。設能在目前社會上尙鮮注意之際，迅速消滅於無形，確立銀行票據之信用，是則空借票據之風可戢，貼水高漲之嚴重問題，亦可隨之解決，其利益豈僅保持「交換支票」之信用而已哉。</p>
<p>歸納言之，筆者認爲銀行簽發「交換支票」，已處於票據債務人之地位，兌付票據為其應盡之義務，除能證明執票人非善意取得外，實無法變更其兌付之責任。際此推行匯劃制度今日，在緊縮法幣，提倡票據之原則下，此業巳成爲流通票據中心之「交換支票」止付問題，誠不容五口人漠視也。（二八·八·一八·）</p>
<h3>美國黃金政策之前途</h3>
<p>— 鄒思聰</p>
<p>自世界各國相繼管理通貨後，許多經濟學者對於黄金的將來，以爲也要像白銀一樣的趨向沒落的途徑。但是美國政府反於一九三六年購入黄金値一，一一士百萬美元，一九三七年購入一，五八六百萬美元，一九三八年購入一，九七四百萬美元，據美國聯邦準備銀行報吿，至本年七月二十六日止美國國庫黄金保有，以每盎斯三十五美元計算，已達一六，二二七百萬美元，佔全世界存金總額的百分之六十四强，比去年同時期又增三，二二五百萬美元。美財長毛根韜氏致參議員華格納的信裹（原函轉載於Banker　June1939）曾提及國庫保有金的分配。據稱國庫保有金的大部份係根據金準備法，用爲聯邦準備銀行發行金證券的準備。如果因爲淸算國際收支上的必要，或因保持美國各種通貨購買力的必要，一經美財長裁可，金證券即可免給金塊。</p>
<p>黃金的貨幣用途有二：第一，儲為貨幣發行的準備，第二，用為國際收支差額的清算，美國國庫擁有一六，二二七百萬美元的黃金，用途如此狹隘，不免要陷於臃腫状態了。美国法定聯邦準備鈔票發行須有百分之四十的金證券作為準備，聯邦準備銀行的存款須儲有百分之三十五的金證券或合法的貨幣作為凖備。法定準備的目的是防遏鈔票流通的數量和銀行信用過度擴張；然而現在所持的黄金及金證券遠超法定所需的凖備。至於用爲國際收支差額淸算，在目前捨黄金以外似還沒有比較再滿意的替代品，許多國家正因缺乏金貨，不得不琿精竭慮，嚴峻的管理外匯，統制進出口貿易，或採取淸算協定，易貨協定等方法，企圖解決國際收支平衡的困難。但是像美國近年國際收支順調的情形，即無存金，這許多方法都無採取的必要；所以美國的黄金積集實在另有理由，</p>
<p>近五年世界黄金大量輸入美國的主因是：海外資本巨額移入，有形貿易及無形貿易均呈順調，以及美國政府以固定美元價格，供給無限制的黄金市塲等等。黄金輸至美國的程序是：資本輸入及借貸平衡順調，使美元對外匯價堅挺，繼之外國或美國的銀行及商人鑒於有利可圖，紛將黄金運至美國按每盎斯三十五美元的價格售與美國財部，再將換得的美元拋售於外匯市塲，美元對外匯價於是回落。由這形式的搆成，世界各地的黄金就源源不斷的流向美國國庫。</p>
<p>至於外資鉅額移向美國的原因，主要是歐亞各地戰雲密佈，烽火漫延，所有資金，乃都把美國作爲避難淵藪。此其一。若干投機家將資本輸至美國的原因，係預揣其本國貨幣對美元的匯價或將跌落，冀圖能從匯價變動獲利，此其一，美國近年對外貿易增進甚速，各外國銀行及商人不得不增加存入美銀行的流動資金。此其三，美國在外投資，因國外政治和經濟情况不佳，紛紛提回本國。此其四，</p>
<p>大量黄金旣移入美國，美政府又不能任其在市場上自由浮沉，掀動市面，因此國庫中窖藏的黄金雖多，還是非繼續搜購不可。許多不明美國政府苦心的人，都抨擊美國政府的黄金政策，認爲黄金已經在重演白銀的歷史，美政府竟復以國民汗血的生產品掉換毫無用處的黄金，實是一種愚蠢的行爲？又有人說他藏黄金不管是一種賭博行爲；也有人說黄金對于美國巳經成爲極大的禍患。</p>
<p>其實美政府不能停止購金的理由是非常簡單的，因爲假如一旦停止購金，美國一般經濟必遭受嚴重影響，外匯市塲和金塊市塲將發生很大的紊亂，國際貿易數字將大見减退，美國一切復興計劃的推進皆受阻礙。近年來慘淡經營而維持着的英美法等幾種主要貨幣的匯價平衡將立吿傾覆。更屬意料中事。所以有人主張着：美政府不妨禁止黄金繼續進口。但道將使世界金價驟落，馴使消滅淸算國際收支的機能；而且產金區域和產金國家的經濟亦將遭受極深刻的打擊而影響到美國自身。叉有人主張把金價從每盎斯値三十五美元的價格貶到二十五美元，但結果亦足以影響美元的國際匯率，美政府自然不敢造决。因此美國的黄金政策便在矛盾心理之下繼續到現在，</p>
<p>現在歐局戰機日迫，各地黃金流美者更多。前天英國政府已正式通知美國停止維持英鎊的匯率了。這也許使美國獲一重行考慮國際金價和匯兌平衡的一個恰當機會。否則近年來的美國景氣，叉將因美元昂貴而失去其繼續的可能。就是為了政治上的理由，美國也有重訂世界金價和國際匯兌平衡的必要，正像歐戰時期，美國爲援助協的國而維持英磅一般。上海的投機者，現在還在搜購黄金和外匯，遲早要做美國經濟的安全和政治的道德之下的犧牲者是可以斷言的。</p>
<h3>日本經濟之前途（續完）</h3>
<p>— 馮美齊女士譯</p>
<p>美國在日本國外貿易上之地位較英國更見重要。尤其在軍需品方面。一九三八年日本來自美國之進口共値九一五百萬日元，或爲日元集團以外進口之半數。日本對美國之出口則爲四二五百萬。日本對非日元集團進口差額之大半，約四九〇百萬日元，皆爲對美貿易。其中多半爲軍需原料之進口。詳言之，一九三七年日本軍需原料進口之百分之五四·四來自美國，百分之一七·五來自英國，百分之七·四來自荷屬東印度羣島。一九三八年來自美國者更多。自日本勵行限制非必需品進口以來，來自英國之進口跌落半數，即自一九三七年之一，一一〇百萬跌至一九三八年之五五〇百萬日元；他方面來自美國之進口僅跌落四分之一，自一，二六九百萬日元跌至九一五百萬日元。換言之美國與英國對日本之出口比例一九三七年爲一二·七比一一，一九三八年則成九·一比五·五。</p>
<p>表（七）爲一九三七至一九三八年美國對日出口之統計。由此可見美國市塲對日本出口之重要。除橡皮等少數項目外，此表包括日本需向國外購取之軍需原料之全部。至少有超等汽油，汽車，機器，及碎金屬四項不能不向美國市塲購取之。日本所購軍需原料之總數及其佔進口之百分數，實頗鉅大。一九三七至一九三八年美國對日出口之五二八百萬美元中，三二六百萬—或百分之六一·二—爲軍需原料。一九三八年由於價格之稍降，該項貨品之數量或較更鉅。故其價値之跌落微而其百分數之增加鉅。一九三七年軍需原料之百分數爲五八·八，一九三八年則增至六六·三。是年內日本購自美國之非必需品進口約减少一半，而生棉之進口的减少百分之一五。在此表中生棉未曾列入軍需原料進口中，雖生棉對日本紡織工業頗見重要，而一部份亦供軍火製造之用。一九三七至一九三八年間美國煤油及煤油生產品之售與日本者的與生棉相等。已製成之軍火並未列入表中。近數年內美國貨品之售與「滿洲國」者爲數亦頗巨，共中軍需原料之百分數尤高。一九三七全一九三八年美國對「滿洲國」出口之三三百萬萬元中，至少有二五百萬或百分之七五·七爲軍需品。是故一九三七至一九三八年美國售與日本及「滿洲國」軍需原料總數達三五〇百萬美元之上，經由中國港口之間接售賣尙未計算在內。</p>
<p>表（七）美國對日出口之分析（千美元）</p>
<p>由此數字足見過去二年間美國市塲對日本戰事關係之重大。如大戰發生，日本對該市塲之需要必更大，然倘英法荷與日本成敵對之國，其貿易必自動斷絕。美國與日本之貿易亦必嚴受限制，則日本將不能再自美國購取其軍需原料矣。</p>
<p>由日本國內經濟之緊縮，出口貿易之衰落，與金儲藏之漸趨枯竭，皆可見其經濟危機之日迫，故大可斷言其崩潰已將立至。由近年來之經騐，知一現代經濟之社會，原可延續其生命至相當期而不即崩潰。惟事態如是擴大，故日本已不能維持若干時期無疑。况兩年來之中日戰事已使其實力使用殆盡矣。</p>

<h3>西南工業建設的新姿態（續二七九期）</h3>
<p>— 朱爾嘉</p>
<p>過去川，黔，滇三省金融機關，除四川省較爲完備外。餘皆落後。黔省在二十四年前數年，現代組織的新式銀行業，自中國銀行爲軍閥逼迫停業及貴州銀行因濫發紙幣倒閉後，即無存在；二十四年至二十六年間，全省亦僅中央銀行及中國農民銀行兩家，在省會的貴陽設有分行各一處，今則川，黔，滇三省較為繁榮縣份，均有現代新式銀行之設立。</p>
<p>政府組織的金融事業機關，為抗戰的新興產物，現在各省除中央政府的機關外，大致均有農商工鑛們調整機關，因此官方金融事業機關，亦爲完成抗建工作者資金融通業之一，</p>
<p>川，黔，滇三省，現時金融業之內容如次：</p>
<p>機關別　四川省　貴州省　雲南省　合计</p>
<p>川，黔，滇三省，地大物博，最近工業建設的各工廠的內容，雖不乏鉅大資本的新企業，如若干紗廠及化學工業，最大的資本，達六百寓元之鉅，但大多數工業，資力尙欠雄厚。而工廠數量方面，更距成爲新興工業中心之境尙遠。</p>
<p>內地工業的待遇，官方有種種獎勵與優待，但偏處上海租界的民族工業，除遭受種種剝削外。在原料之供給及產品之出路。復隨時有斷絕的危險，兩者相去，不啻天壤。但上海工業界雖有探木而棲之念，其所以趙趄不前者，不外內地安全缺乏保障及遷廠運輸困難。而上海因外匯黑市投機掀起的高物價之市塲，允爲留戀瞻顧的主要原素。今因財部圖消戢外匯黑市之在漲，而有限制提存之舉，已有威脅工業資金的凍着，同時日方交通綫的封鎖與把持和原料搜刮獨估的加强，過剩商品的傾銷，已使上海工業受四面楚歌的包圍。而內地交通在今日因當局努力改進，已無問題，若政府方面對於內地安全方面的保障，以國營保險之手段，略予扶植，則上海租界內的民族工業，將為重新權衡生路而考慮。</p>

<h3>上海生絲業的當前難關（續）</h3>
<p>— 瞿揚</p>
<p>對于成品的輸出，最近的將來，也可能假手某機圍到絕對管理的地步，這又是獨佔上海生絲出口業和排斥第三國利益的最好措置。「商品出口檢定」的招牌，藉口檢騐生絲品質，替發「出口證明書，」來執行戰前實業部商品局的任務，來「統制」上海生絲的輸出，同時還可攫取全部生絲出口的外匯，使全部生絲業的產製銷，完全成爲他的附庸機構。</p>
<p>這就是上海絲業的當前危機，然而我們就束手待斃了麼？</p>
<p>（三）奮鬥則生，妥協即亡，第三條路是毀滅的終點，祇斷送了自己光明的前途。</p>
<p>怎樣纔是絲業求生存</p>
<p>在上海從業于絲業的人，從廠主到職工，從經紀人到出口行，這三方面的人數，當不下於一二〇〇〇人吧！從前幾次人家對於絲業的壓迫，從那種一面妥協，一面得寸進尺的情形看來，堅强的有組織的自衛，是可能停止對方進攻的步驟的，不過這需要絲廠絲棧出口行不論華商和洋商，來一次集體行動，一切不顧，一切不理的運動擴展開來，持久起來，使他統制的企圖，在停頓情形上失去效用，進而促使世界的注意，這還是消極的一面。</p>
<p>這積極的一面，是使絲廠內移，規模大的，使它化整爲零，以免不致有一網打盡之虞，小型絲廠在無錫郊外的成效，誰都知道是最好的反統制的經濟游擊軍。這在上海絲業，由于繭運無法解決，而轉在內地開設小廠，以及這種經營有利的把握，已足够證明，大絲廠在現在的條件下，要適應環境，改變自己形態，使自己繼續生存，並積蓄今後發展力量，那種化整爲零，回向游擊區的辦法，已不是一句空談，而是一個事實。</p>
<p>不以出口爲最終目的</p>
<p>據傳華北的棉花，除自已儘量應用外，爲反統制的緣故，把剩餘的都燒成灰燼，這是打擊一以戰養戰」的最好辦法。在我們絲業上要被統制的時候，使絲廠化整爲零，縮小生絲產量，决不使一絲一縷爲所利用，亦是最好的應付方針，除此，沒有第三條路，可以給我們選擇，有之，即爲掩飾自己的屈膝，跑向毀滅的終點，斷送自己光明燦爛的前途而已！。　—八月六日寄自無錫—　（完）</p>

<h3>太古怡和　增收南華客票票價</h3>
<p>太古及怡和兩公司，自於本年六月二十二日改訂客票票價後，其大菜間船票價目以港幣爲單位，官房統艙各級船票價目以國幣爲單位。最近各該公司因鑒於外滙暴縮，開支日增，故定於九月一日起，會同將由滬至華南各埠之官房統艙客票價目，一律增加一成以上，仍以國幣爲單位。至大菜間客票價目，則仍照該二公司於六月二十二日所改訂之票價，此决並未增加。茲將該二公司由滬至香港海防之新訂票價，開列如後：</p>
<p>上海至香港　官艙國幣六十五元，房艙五十元，吊舖四十元，統艙二十六元。</p>
<p>上海至海防　官艙國幣一百二十元，房艙八十八元，品鋪五十八元，統艙四十七元。</p>
<p>海防登岸稅　仍爲官艙四元，房艙二元，吊舖及統艙一元。</p>
<p>依據該公司等八月二十二日增價辦法，凡於增價日期前預付有定洋或已購得船票者，仍可享受舊價。此决該二公司爲謀票價一律起見，凡在九月一日或以後由滬南駛之輪船，其票價不論已付定洋或已購船票，均須依據新訂價目購票。關於該二公司之北洋班票價，則仍照六月二十二日所訂票價發售，此次並不增價。</p>
<h3>旅美嚮導</h3>
<p>— 詢</p>
<p>衣食住行</p>
<p>衣　衣服的準備，已由本刋「赴美留學手續」內講過，無須再述。現在祇就穿着方面，大略講一下。小姐們普通均穿中國衣服，所以沒有特別要注意的地方。在美國普通的一般男學生，衣服比蛟隨便，但有些時候亦不可太大意。一般大城市人的衣飾比小城市整齊，東部人比西部人講究，研究院的學生與本科學生更有顯著的差異，文法科學生也比理工科强。這當然祇指一般而論，少數的例外是常有的。以時問論，宴會跳舞會等最講究，但常禮服普通很少需要；會見客人（尤其是女人）與赴茶會時也要穿着整齊。大一些的食堂與體面的飯店，除非在極炎熱的夏天，也不可草率。學生上課在大城裏多半很整齊，小城有時背心短褂，領帶都不一定打。西部大學生，不打領帶幾成風俗，夏天多半祇襯衫長褲，間或用一條領帶。在學校附近的小飯店裏，大半隨便得很。美國人穿衣，以上下一色最普通，上衣與褲子顏色不同，雖然也可以，但到考究的地方很少人這樣打扮。</p>
<p>本國學生赴美深造，對於衣着方面當然以從俗爲尙，但不要學所謂名士派（長頭髮，大領結）惹人非笑，最好是處處留心他人，跟着大多數走。普通時候寗可整齊一點，不要太隨便，淸潔方面更不可忽略。美國人對他們本國人事事可輕恕，對外國人反有時吹毛求疵，說別人不知禮貌。我國僑民在美國開設的洗衣店，幾乎無處不有，雖然價錢不一定怎樣便宜，工作總比一般美國洗衣匠道地，况且他們辛苦賺來的錢，不是寄回祖國，便是捐給某决災荒或助抗戰之用。各旅居美國者照顧他們生意可說是一種義務。他們平常對待本國學生，也十分親熱；會講廣東話的學生逢到年節或者會被邀至店裏過節，吃一頓豐富的酒席。女同學多半是自己洗衣，女生宿舍的民房多半有洗衣的設備。在美國時，對於自己的衣帽，允其是皮大衣等講究的東西，切不可隨意放置。特別在大城裏，有些人見了好東西是不客氣的。（待續）</p>
<h3>上海航業動態（續）</h3>
<p>— 景</p>
<p>國內航路　原有長江錢華南綫華北綫諸航輪，長江綫由上海黄浦江出吳淞口溯長江以西，經鎮江，南京，蕪湖，九江而達漢口，由漢而上則可抵長沙，宜昌，重慶等埠，華南班出上海黄浦江出吳淞口南迤，而入東海及南海，各航輪大都以廣州爲終點，駛往海防之航輪絕少。華北班航輪由上海黄浦江出吳淞口北抱，而入黄海及渤海而達天津中途停靠靑島威海衛，烟臺等埠，亦有航輪以安東大連牛莊及秦皇島等埠爲終點者。戰後各航綫情形因時局不定以是常有變遷，長江航輪除日輪尙能行駛滬漢錢外，各外商輪船僅能通航至長江口張黄港新港等埠。華南錢，現因安南海防成爲入我國內地要道以來，客貨繁盛，故各公司輪船大都改以海防爲終點。其他各海口如汕頭，厦門，廣州等埠相繼陷落，以是華南航路之主要港埠，惟僅香港海防二埠而已，華北航路各公司輪船仍繼續航行，以滬津間客貨尙稱繁密，茲將行駛我國沿海各口岸及安南間各船公司名稱及其所航路綫分述如次。　一，怡和公司（Indo·China　S·N·Go；）英商，行駛小長江航綫者有瑞和，同和等輪，班期每星期有數次，均係當日可到達者。行駛海防天津間者，有新型輪船泰生，、永生，德生三輪，其載重均在四千噸左右，前國營招商局之元亨利貞四新輪自轉售與該公司後改名爲怡生，和生，裕生，明生，各輪噸位均在三千四百噸左右。艙位計分頭二等大菜間，官艙，房艙（僅永生泰生德生等輪有之）吊舖及統艙等艙位，該公司自有此四新輪加入航綫以來，陣容日見堅强。上述各輪定於每星期四日由滬南駛經香港而達海防再由防駛回上海，然後再北駛經威海衛烟臺而達天津，如是輪流行駛，每决週行的需時三十餘日，除上述各輪外尙有阜生，利生，貴生，富陞，春生等輪行駛滬靑，滬港等綫。</p>
<p>二，太古公司（ChinaMavigation）亦係英商，行駛滬津綫者有正班輪順天，盛京，湖南三輪，以順天盛京輪爲最著，其噸位的在三千餘噸左右，艙位分頭二等大菜問（順天輪無二等大菜間）房艙，（湖南輪無房艙）吊鋪統艙等數級每逢星期二六由滬開往天津途經靑島威海衛烟臺等埠，由滬至津僅三日可達，每逢星期四日則由天津開回。行駛滬防間者有濟南太原嘉應，瓊州，廣東等輪，各輪中以濟南太原爲最著，噸位在三千噸左右，艙位分大菜間官艙吊舖（房艙僅嘉應有之）統艙等數級。其行駛班期的每星期一次，由滬至防行駛的需十日，中途在香港（停留約二日）廣州灣等埠停靠，除外尙有山東，四川，江蘇等輪則常行駛滬港間兼或兼灣海防。此數輪則有房艙而無吊舖之設備，其他各輪如雲南，湖北，岳州，海口，南昌等輪則專駛天津香港間，中途間或在滬停靠而已，最近該公司計闢上海暹邏及上海星加坡兩綫，以蘇州及張家口二輪行駛滬暹，中途在香港土倫西貢等埠停靠，以慶元及貴陽二輪行駛上海星加坡錢，以應客貨之需要。</p>

<h3>歐洲風雲緊急上海街頭形色</h3>
<p>— （新夢）</p>
<p>街頭報販非常活躍　投機商人忐忑不安</p>
<p>歐洲的空气已極度緊張，呈現了大戰前夜的形態，而遠在东方一角的上海，爲了歐洲風云，也打開了沉闷局面，突然緊張起來。每一个人在期待着歐洲傳來的消息，是和還是战？</p>
<p>好久不聽見的「號外」之聲，父傳遍大街小巷，望平街上的報販，叉大見活躍，出起風头來，日报，夜報，還有號外，拿到了手，就向四處奔跑，一面奔，一面在拔挺了喉嚨喊。</p>
<p>一大早起來，街顛上就候滿了人，在等待報紙的出來。聰明的商人，醫生，用壁報來襯托自己的廣告，報紙貼了拱來，就圍滿了捨不得買一份報來看的人，他們都細看著國際的消息，歐洲的風雲。</p>
<p>愛多亞路長耕里的一帶，每天下午，有不少人候著幾家外國報紙把新聞撮要貼出來，看看歐洲會否開火？希特勒是怎樣？張伯倫又是怎檬？</p>
<p>一般投機朋友，爲了歐洲風雲，必裏也每一個都在忐忑不安，手頭有金子，外匯的是否將趁此機會吐出；不相信金子會馬上跌價的，在猶預著能不能買進。瞬息萬變，一天幾租市價的投機市塲，目光要看得準，發財也在這時候，破產也在這時候！</p>
<p>話盒子一打開，做生意的三句不脫本行：有的論歐戰一開塲，外匯上漲，洋貨會跌價；也有說歐洲有了戰事，一部分洋貨將絕跡市場，大漲特漲，前次的歐戰，有過不少例子。各有理由，也說不得誰是誰非</p>
<p>比較知識水準高些的，就大談其國際問題。德蘇互不侵犯條約的訂立，出人意外，對中國他如何有利，日本會怎樣失望，萬一歐洲發生戰事，東方將怎樣？上海，香港，是否會有變化？歐戰對中國有利還是有害？</p>
<p>整個都市中的人們，對歐洲事件如此關心，結果使終年不看報紙的娘兒們，也在大談其一知半解的國際新聞。德國和俄國攀朋友啦，祗苦了「××××」。歐洲打起仗來，上海能夠安穩嗎？租界上的外國人不要也開起火來，那就糟糕，風聲不好，祇有回內地去。</p>
<p>總之，暈幾天，你無論守在家裏，走到外面，是到處可聽見有人在談歐洲的事件。雖然還隔重洋，好像近在咫尺，這證明了在近代的世界上，一隅的戰爭，會影饗友每一個角落裏，何況國際間的關係，都是休戚相關的。</p>
<h3>上海洋行的加薪情形</h3>
<p>— 洋員</p>
<p>近半年來上海市民生活因物價高漲，十分困難，洋行員當然也不能例外。平均三五十塊錢一月的薪水，單拿它來調換食糧，已覺困難，所以任憑你把生活刻苦到怎樣地步，穿長衣的改穿短衣，吃飯的改吃稀飯，或老改吃　粉，但是在物償飛漲的今天，還是無法維持生計。因此，希望公司當局普加薪水（津貼），固然是每個洋行員迫切的要求，而各洋行加薪的情形，也就成爲大家所需要知道的消息。</p>
<p>筆者踏進洋行巳二十多年，前後服務過的洋行也有十餘家，因爲認識的洋行員很多，所以對各洋行加薪的情形也比較熟悉，在大家需要知道些各洋行加薪的情形下，把我所知道的寫下來告訴大家，也不爲無意義吧。</p>
<p>下面是幾個著名洋行的加薪情形：</p>
<p>中烟公司百分之二十到三十，正廣和百分之三十，卜內門百分之二十到四十，會德豐百分之二十，自來火公司百分之二十，沙遜洋行百分之二十到三十，西門子百分之二十，天祥百分之二十，電話公司百分之四十，通用電氣公司百分之三十，美孚百分之＋，德士古百分之十五，電力公司百分之二十。</p>
<p>在這些洋行中，一部份是自動加的，一部份是經過請求得來的：不過自動也好，被動也好，各該公司當局之能體諒職工生活的痛苦這一點，是萬分值得我們欽佩的。</p>
<p>但是還有不少洋行，對職工生活抱著不理會的觀念，如著名的××洋行就是其中之一。據說該行經理當工部局董事會議席上，討論工部局職員的加薪問題時，獨一無二的投著反對票，該行職員起初請求當局加薪時，當局回答：「××是英商，依照工部局辦法，所以只加了一二元。後來工部局如了二成，職員耍求照加，當局又說：工部局是工部局，××是××，」拒不依照工部局的辦法。</p>
<p>記得不知那年的工部局年報中，在談到巡捕薪水的時候，報告俄捕薪水每月九十元，華捕薪水每月四十元，年報在說明華捕薪水之所以較低，先因爲食米之華人，其費用較食肉之俄人爲低。現在米價縱到四十元，食米的華人，所拿薪水與以前一樣的，連米也吃不成了，上海洋行員對於這一點實在是感覺得很痛切的。</p>
<h3>雨過天青</h3>
<p>— 包天笑</p>
<p>第十五回　海外豔聞忽迎桃葉火中奇景竟粲蓮花</p>
<p>那一天，甲昂地方有個音樂會，愛　絲的母親，也是一位音樂家，預先　　，那晚上是赴音樂會去了。本來愛麗線也要去的，忽然那天的下午，　痛起來了。頭痛原是小事，但音樂曾裹，就有許多熟人，歐西女士，最　　貌，　痛往往使人緒神不快，所以愛太太說：不去也就罷了，在家裹　　吧！這個音樂會，盛級一時，里昂大學也　許多人去的。成功在音樂上，不　分研究，但他也去的，他以爲愛麗絲母女，必在那裹的。可是後來只見愛太太，不見愛小咀，使他很爲失望。道個香樂會到午夜十二點鐘以後　散，不想到－一點半鐘，傳進來一個消息，　是亞爾培阿派　　　潔了。這　亞　的公寓。　實在　一點時候，那　　裏的第二層樓上，　兩個孩子已經闖了禍。到十一點十五分鐘，方有人覺察，二十分分　時，　火隊已經到了那裏。馬路上，都知道這個亞爾培大樓失火了。但音樂會有　　著一篇名曲那位鋼琴名手，與小提琴專家，　是從巴黎請來的。大家正在側耳　　，加著音樂會裏的房子，又建築得好，外面的雜聲，一點也不能進來。及至．一曲方終，音樂會的　事，方報告說是：「亞爾培大樓失火，諸位光生，諸位女士，有住得與它那裏附近的嗎？」這句話一說出來，第一個愛大太奪門而出。第二個成功，跟蹤而行。其餘與亞爾培大樓有關係的，里昂大學的學生，與愛麗絲有交誼的，也都陸績的跑出來。一到馬路上，已是人聲鼎沸，早望見天半一片紅光了。這時俟，歐洲救火的方法，還沒有像後來的進步。愛太太到了亞爾培路她住的公厲傍邊，只不見她的愛女愛麗絲。她想：．今晚愛麗絲一定在家裹，沒有出門。她是住在五層樓上，而起火是在三層樓，火性是向上的，樓梯一燒斷，五層樓上的人，怎磨能下來呢？而且她是說頭痛，也許巳經是在熟睡中的了。愛太太想到那裏，雙腳亂跳，慘呼著道：「愛麗絲！我的愛麗絲！誰去救她呀！」只見人　中跳出一個人來道：「愛太太，我去尋愛麗絲去！」他從救火的雲梯上，躍進火窟去了。（一七四）</p>
<h3>入地無門</h3>
<p>— 白華</p>
<p>“Flirting　With　Fates'</p>
<p>米高梅公司出品　南京大戲院映</p>
<p>闊嘴巴喬埃勃朗在米高梅公司也有著悠久的歷史，可是他的作品也都是所謂「妙不可言」的胡鬧片。如果和好萊塢的其他滑稽明星比較起來，他不及勞萊哈台的幽默（勞萊哈台也有很鬧得不堪的作品），但也不比馬克斯三兄弟及李滋三兄弟討厭。他的每一部作品都非常熱鬧，劇作者因爲要湊熱鬧，故事的編製就不問合理和不合理了。</p>
<p>最近，勞萊哈台的「護花使者」及李滋三兄弟的「三劍客」公映以後，一般的意見，放棄劇作遷就演員的方法是獲得相當的成功的，喬埃勃朗這部「入地無門」，是至少受著這種影響的。</p>
<p>故事是道樣的：喬埃勃朗是旅行劇團的主人，他率領著團員到南美去表演，因和當地劇院主人不睦，窮困客地。他因爲保有壽險，企圖自殺，以賠款濟各團員。於是在種種自殺方法下鬧了種種笑話，終於獲得劇院主人允許表演一年的合同。</p>
<p>這故事自然是荒唐的，滑稽也都過份誇張，但是導演在能利用濃厚的地方色彩和音樂的氛圍是至少受了上述的影饗。</p>
<p>而喬埃勃朗自殺膠扮牛兩節，也都可愛。如喝酒時的恣態，及牛的行動，比較一般專門學取一點皮毛的導演是高明得多了。</p>
<p>這劇本如果能夠加強團員們潦倒時的各種窘態，和黨徒們因不滿於桑柯的貪愛女色，致釀成叛變，給予史德斐杜娜和里沃卡利魯更多演戲的機會，或許也能獲得史好的效果。</p>

<h3>Attitudes of England and France Towards Germany: Insisting on Equal Status and Free Negotiations; Ambassador Henderson Returns to Berlin Today; British Government Carefully Discussing the Reply</h3>
<p>London, after this afternoon's cabinet meeting, a communiqué was issued stating that the cabinet will continue to meet at noon tomorrow. It is widely expected that Ambassador Henderson will return to Berlin tomorrow with the British government's reply to Hitler. The contents of the document from Hitler to the British government, as reported by various newspapers, have not been officially authorized and are not accurate. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London, Sir Nevile Henderson, the British Ambassador to Germany, returned here today with proposals from the German Führer Hitler. The authorities have submitted them to the cabinet for discussion. According to what Polish sources here know, the demands of Führer Hitler are: Firstly, to recover Danzig; Secondly, to build a military road through the Polish Corridor; and he insists that Britain first abandon the guarantees it has provided to Poland, after which Germany can directly negotiate with Poland to redraw the German-Polish border. According to well-informed sources, Führer Hitler strongly asserted during his meeting with Ambassador Henderson yesterday that Germans within Poland are being mistreated and that Poland's attitude is rigid because of the guarantees provided by Western European countries. Germany is dissatisfied with all of this, and the current situation cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely. The solution is for Germany to recover the city of Danzig and build a "military corridor" through the Polish Corridor before negotiations with Poland can begin. However, if incidents occur during the negotiations, Germany must still resort to military action against Poland. Furthermore, Germany is willing to maintain friendly relations with Britain. Although the colonial issue between the two countries remains unresolved, it may be resolved in a few years. Once the Polish issue is resolved, Germany is willing to immediately negotiate disarmament matters. This news has been confirmed by government officials, who said that Germany is still using force as a threat. Under these circumstances, Britain must still take a firm stance. This afternoon, Foreign Secretary Halifax made a sincere statement to Polish Ambassador Raczynski, and the two agreed that the Polish government should do its utmost to avoid all incidents so that Germany would have no excuse to use the alleged mistreatment of Germans. Regarding this matter, the British government's reply to Führer Hitler will also strongly emphasize the Polish government's sincerity. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>London, regarding the proposals made by Führer Hitler, the British government's reply will be handed to Ambassador Henderson tomorrow to take back to Berlin. Government officials here anticipate that the reply will clarify three points: (1) The guarantee that Britain has provided to Poland is fully valid; (2) Führer Hitler has expressed "friendly intentions" towards Britain, and Britain has always been prepared to discuss various outstanding issues and disarmament issues with Germany; (3) This general issue of substance is not related to the issue of Britain's guarantee to Poland. However, under strong threats, Poland would not be able to accept Germany's dictatorial orders and negotiate with it.</p>
<p>Polish people here are gratified that Britain's attitude is extremely firm and that Germany's attempt to create a second Munich has failed to materialize. In short, British government officials believe that while the countries of the Peace Front are still prepared to discuss various outstanding issues, they are determined to resist strong pressure and reject unilateral solutions. Although Germany is exchanging views with Britain and France, unless it agrees to negotiate on an equal footing and in a spirit of freedom, the current tense situation may not be eased. What Germany's attitude will ultimately be can be seen after the British reply reaches Berlin, whether the country responds again or takes violent action. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Paris, it is rumored that German Führer Hitler presented a concrete peace plan when he met with the British and French ambassadors yesterday. Sources close to the government here deny this, saying that when Hitler met with British Ambassador Henderson, he only expressed his willingness to reclaim the Free City of Danzig and part of the Polish Corridor in accordance with the "generous proposals" he made in his speech to the Reichstag on April 28 of this year. (Note: Hitler said at the time that Germany proposed: (1) Danzig should return to Germany; (2) Germany should build one autobahn and one railway across the Polish Corridor; (3) Germany recognizes Poland's economic interests in Danzig; (4) Clearly define the German-Polish border.) and demanded that the German minority in Poland be transferred to Germany. Apart from this, there are no other proposals. People here generally believe that the optimistic comments made by Berlin and the rumors of Hitler's so-called peace plan are intended to shift the responsibility for future events to Britain and France, so that they can accuse Britain and France of being warmongers before world opinion. Responsible officials also said that Hitler's proposal in April of this year had already been rejected by Poland, and Poland seems unlikely to accept greater sacrifices at this time. Therefore, although a peaceful solution is not completely hopeless, it can be asserted that Britain and France will not succumb to Germany's threats. The speeches made by British Prime Minister Chamberlain and French Prime Minister Daladier the other day have clearly defined the positions of the two countries, and it is well known to the world that they cannot make further concessions.

<h3>British Authorities Busy with Negotiations; Cabinet Meets Twice; French Ambassador Visits Hitler Again; Demands Concrete Explanation of Opinions</h3>
<p>London, the cabinet was originally scheduled to hold a cabinet meeting at 10:30 a.m. to draft a reply to be taken to Berlin by Ambassador Henderson and presented to Führer Hitler. Because the wording of this reply needs to be carefully considered, the cabinet meeting has been changed to 3:00 p.m. Ambassador Henderson also paid a visit to Prime Minister Chamberlain at 11:00 a.m. for a confidential discussion lasting 35 minutes. Foreign Secretary Halifax, Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs Butler, Sir Cadogan, Home Secretary Hoare, and Minister without Portfolio Anderson successively arrived to conduct talks. They gradually dispersed at 1:00 p.m. At 2:30 p.m., Foreign Secretary Halifax again paid a visit to the Prime Minister to conduct talks. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>London, Prime Minister Chamberlain and Foreign Secretary Halifax discussed the European situation this afternoon for three hours. The Foreign Secretary then received Polish Ambassador Raczynski, and the Prime Minister went to Buckingham Palace to meet King George VI for an hour and a half. At the same time, Dominion Affairs Minister Inskip received representatives of the various Dominions and informed them of the situation. The cabinet then held an important meeting at 6:30 p.m. at the Prime Minister's residence at 10 Downing Street to discuss the proposals of Führer Hitler brought by Ambassador Henderson. It ended at 8:55 p.m. Ambassador Henderson was also summoned to attend. According to official sources, a cabinet subcommittee is scheduled to continue meeting in the evening to draft an answer, which will be submitted to the full cabinet for approval tomorrow before being taken to Berlin by Ambassador Henderson. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin, French Ambassador Coulondre, having received orders from his government, paid another visit to Führer Hitler this afternoon and spoke with him for 30 minutes. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Paris, it is heard that the French government's instructions to Ambassador Coulondre in Berlin are largely the same as French Prime Minister Daladier's broadcast speech. In short, France is prepared to cooperate and resolve disputes through negotiations, but is determined to oppose the use of force. According to French sources, Hitler's remarks to Coulondre the day before were rather vague. (Reuters dispatch, 27th)</p>
<p>Paris, responsible parties have declared that after French Ambassador Coulondre's meeting with Führer Hitler yesterday, he reported the details to the government. This morning, Prime Minister Daladier, together with Foreign Minister Bonnet and Secretary-General of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Léger, studied them and will immediately send a new instruction to Ambassador Coulondre, instructing him to visit Führer Hitler again. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Paris, at this time of extreme crisis, the morning newspapers and public opinion here are very calm. Generally, it is said that the policy to deal with the situation is very clear, that is, to resist all attempts to use force and, at the same time, to negotiate on a reasonable basis. As for the peace proposals that German Führer Hitler handed to British Ambassador Henderson to take back to London, the morning newspapers here do not seem to regard them as an acceptable basis for negotiation, because Germany's demands regarding the city of Danzig are still backed by direct action. In addition, the newspapers also said that the future is not hopeless and that peace can still achieve a final victory, but fear that this is a "German peace." Le Journal reported that after Führer Hitler met with our country's ambassador to Germany, Coulondre, our government's standing committee has instructed the ambassador to present an answer, the content of which is to explain the military measures announced by the government yesterday and to inform them that although France is eager to establish a peaceful solution, it is also prepared to deal with extraordinary events. It is heard that this answer was issued after notifying the British government. In short, what Ambassador Coulondre was ordered to explain to Führer Hitler was none other than the position explained by Prime Minister Daladier in his broadcast speech the other day. (Havas dispatch, 27th)</p>
<h3>Berlin Quietly Awaits British Reply; Germany and Italy Continue to Exchange Views</h3>
<p>Berlin, British Ambassador Henderson is scheduled to return here tomorrow with the British government's reply. The general public is eagerly awaiting it. Well-informed sources also said that at least for the moment there is "room to breathe." The situation is not expected to have any major developments before tomorrow. Italian newspapers' comments are highly regarded for the efforts made by all parties to avoid war, which is very noteworthy. In addition, there is no talk of convening the German Reichstag, but all members of the Reichstag are staying in the capital. The venue, the Kroll Opera House, has also been prepared for the meeting. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Paris, according to well-informed German sources, Ambassador Henderson's return to Berlin can at least slow down the evolution of the situation. It is expected that before tomorrow, no major decisions will be made by all parties. Hitler had originally planned to convene the parliament tonight, but has now abandoned the plan. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Berlin, Führer Hitler received Air Minister Goering at noon today, and then received Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and General Goering at 5:30 p.m. The important role that General Goering plays in recent activities can be seen from this. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome, German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen again relayed opinions from Führer Hitler via long-distance telephone to Prime Minister Mussolini this afternoon. The Prime Minister immediately presented an answer and asked Ambassador Mackensen to relay it to Führer Hitler. Foreign Minister Ciano was also present at the time. However, what Hitler's opinions and Mussolini's answer contained are still unknown. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome, political figures here all acknowledge that the situation is extremely serious, but also realize that peace is not yet hopeless. This view is based on two facts: (1) As of now, no irreversible event has occurred; (2) The authorities of major European countries are still maintaining diplomatic contact. In particular, Italy, which is at the center of the Berlin-Rome axis, has a more moderate attitude and is actively engaged in mediation. Regarding this, the famous journalist Gayda (who is regarded as Prime Minister Mussolini's mouthpiece) recently published an article in the semi-official newspaper Il Giornale d'Italia, which said: "Italy has issued a statement that it is willing to act completely in concert with Germany and to actively act politically for peace on the basis of justice. However, it is not yet known whether this action can obtain full understanding in Europe so that it can develop smoothly." The Rome Daily News reported that Prime Minister Mussolini and German Führer Hitler have repeatedly exchanged views via long-distance telephone, and Britain and France are also actively engaged in activities. All of this deserves special attention. "At this time, what tens of millions of people are praying for is that common sense can prevail. The land and oceans of the world are so vast that all countries can have an appropriate place. No matter how sensitive the issues are, there is no reason why they must be resolved by force. This method of resolution only sacrifices millions of lives." (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Turkey Supports the Peace Front; President Receives German Ambassador</h3>
<p>Istanbul, today's newspapers here report that the country will always absolutely adhere to its promises and support the Balkan and Anglo-French Peace Front. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Istanbul, Turkey. It is rumored that Turkey is currently considering signing a non-aggression treaty with the Soviet Union. The French-language "République" newspaper here denies this, saying that the purpose of this rumor is to undermine the unity of the Balkan Entente countries, and its intentions are sinister and should not be believed. (Havas dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Voroshilov Explains the Reasons for the Breakdown of the Anglo-French-Soviet Negotiations; the Point of Contention is that Poland Does Not Allow Passage</h3>
<p>Moscow, Izvestia recently sent a representative to meet with Soviet Chief Military Representative Voroshilov to ask a number of questions regarding the Anglo-French-Soviet military negotiations, which were answered separately as follows:</p>
<p>(Question) Why were the negotiations with the Anglo-French military delegation suspended?</p>
<p>(Answer) Because serious disputes arose during the negotiations, they have been declared broken down. The Anglo-French military delegation has already departed for their home countries.</p>
<p>(Question) What exactly is the content of this dispute? Can we hear about it?</p>
<p>(Answer) The Soviet military delegation believes that since the Soviet Union does not border the aggressor countries, if its troops want to assist Britain, France, and Poland, they must be allowed to pass through Polish territory. There is no other way to come into contact with the aggressor's troops. If Soviet troops are not allowed to pass through Poland, they cannot engage in military cooperation with British and French troops. This is the same as if British and American troops were not allowed to operate in France during the last World War, they could not engage in military cooperation with French troops. However, although this position is obviously completely correct, the Anglo-French military representatives did not agree. The Polish government even publicly declared that the country does not need or accept Soviet military assistance. Therefore, military cooperation between the Soviet Union and these countries became impossible. This is the basic point of contention, and therefore the negotiations were declared broken down.</p>
<p>(Question) Has the issue of supplying Poland with raw materials and military materials been discussed during the negotiations?</p>
<p>(Answer) It has not been discussed. The supply of raw materials and military materials is a commercial issue. If only these materials are to be supplied to Poland, there is no need to conclude a mutual assistance pact, let alone a military alliance. For example, the United States and several other countries, including Japan, have not concluded a mutual assistance pact or military alliance, but they have continuously sold raw materials and military materials to Japan for the past two years, even though Japan is at war with China. The negotiations discussed military assistance, not the supply of raw materials and military materials.</p>
<p>(Question) According to a diplomatic correspondent for the British Daily Mail, the Anglo-French military delegation asked the Soviet delegation whether the Soviet Union was prepared to supply Poland with aircraft and military supplies, and to station the Red Army on the border to prepare. The Soviet Union then replied with the following suggestion: "After the outbreak of war, immediately occupy Vilnius and Nowogródek in the northeast, and occupy the three provinces of Lviv, Tarnopol, and Stanisławów in the southeast. If necessary, the Red Army can provide Poland with military assistance from these areas." What do you think of this statement by the newspaper's diplomatic correspondent? Does it correspond to the facts?</p>
<p>(Answer) This statement is a lie from beginning to end. Its author is a barbaric liar, and the newspaper that publishes this kind of lie by its diplomatic correspondent is a rumor-mongering newspaper.</p>
<p>(Question) According to a Reuters radio broadcast, Voroshilov told the leaders of the Anglo-French military delegation today that since the Soviet Union and Germany have concluded a non-aggression pact, the Soviet government believes that there is no purpose in continuing negotiations with Britain and France." Does this statement by Reuters correspond to the facts?</p>
<p>(Answer) It does not correspond to the facts. The breakdown of negotiations with the Anglo-French military delegation was not because the Soviet Union and Germany concluded a non-aggression pact. On the contrary, the conclusion of a non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Germany, among other reasons, was one of the consequences of the Anglo-French military negotiations being deadlocked due to insurmountable disputes. (TASS dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>Moscow, the Anglo-French military delegation left Moscow by train yesterday. The representatives of both countries were dressed in civilian clothes, in stark contrast to the gorgeous uniforms and gold emblems they wore when they arrived. The Russian officers who saw them off were the same ones who had welcomed them before. (Associated Press dispatch, 27th)</p>

<p>Editorial</p>
<h3>European Changes and the Far East</h3>
<p>The European crisis had been brewing for some time, becoming increasingly acute by mid-August. On the 23rd night, the Soviet Union suddenly concluded a non-aggression treaty with Germany, completing the agreement in the blink of an eye. As a result, the European situation, and indeed the entire international landscape, underwent a transformation. The Soviet Union has at least two wishes in Europe: first, to ensure stability on its western frontier. It initially engaged with Britain and France to restrain Germany's eastward expansion. Ultimately, it concluded a treaty with Germany, securing a solemn pledge that Germany would not advance eastward. Its change of heart is consistent: second, to sit idly by and observe the rise and fall of capitalist nations. When threatened by Germany's arrogance, it began to approach Britain and France, but this carried the risk of being drawn into a vortex of trouble. Subsequently, the promise of 200 million German marks and a guarantee of abandoning the eastward expansion policy enticed Germany to Moscow. This sincerity was evident, and the Soviet Union broke away from Britain and France. In these shifting alliances, why should the Soviet Union prioritize being close to Britain or France, Germany, or have any emotional attachments, affections, or resentments when it could remain outside the whirlpool? Achieving both goals in one move was a major gain for the Soviet Union. As for its impact on the European situation, we are not yet ready to see this as an opportunity for the countries in the vortex to move towards rise and fall. However, we can infer that the scope of the war will be reduced when a European war breaks out. The Soviet-German link has already been largely disentangled. Germany and Italy are allies, and should presumably "share blessings and share hardships." However, the conditions conveyed by the British ambassador to Germany, Henderson, between Berlin and London were all requests from the German side, with nothing pertaining to Italy. Therefore, the war is being fought because the conditions were not met. What does Italy have to do with it? This is no accident; there must be a subtle purpose in this final act of diplomacy. Not only that, but the possibility of Germany enticing Japan to join the war has also decreased to almost zero. Therefore, while the issue of the Free City of Danzig was once seen as the trigger for a world war, today we can at least infer that the initial stages of the war will be confined to Europe, with the Soviet Union outside its scope, and the Far East even further removed.</p>
<p>Whether there will be war is uncertain. If there is war, it is also uncertain whether it will be a swift, decisive conflict or a large-scale, protracted one. However, the geographical scope of the initial stages of the war is smaller than previously observed, as mentioned above. The time it takes to evolve from the initial stage to the next will be inversely proportional to the geographical scope. If war is unavoidable and cannot be resolved quickly, the various possible developments in the international arena will become increasingly chaotic and complex due to the Soviet-German non-aggression pact. Making this chaos and complexity simple and clear will naturally require a longer period of brewing. Although there is no war yet, the various brewing processes for the next stage have already begun. The initial stage of the European war has no bearing on China; the overall situation in the next stage depends on the United States, the Soviet Union, and Japan. Therefore, we must closely monitor the beginnings of this brewing process today.</p>
<p>Let's start with the United States: it cherishes freedom, adheres to democracy, safeguards international justice, and respects treaty obligations. It does not lightly abandon its interests, its peace, or its traditional policy of non-involvement in disputes outside the Americas. It is frank, sincere, and does not favor expediency. It is strong, resolute, and responsible, not exploiting others, nor being exploited by them. All these virtues are the foundation of American policy. Grasping this foundation to observe America's advances and retreats will be accurate in the majority of cases. The few things that could go wrong are short-sighted greed and narrow-minded isolationism, but its statesmen and public opinion can usually overcome these. Before and after the 23rd night of this month, the fundamentals of American policy have not changed at all. However, that night was not without a considerable degree of nightmares. Through this nightmare, it strengthened its sympathy for Britain and France on the one hand, and intensified its consideration of measures on the other. President Roosevelt's telegrams to King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy and German leader Hitler were sincere appeals for peace in the face of the European crisis. However, in respecting the independence and sovereignty of other nations and condemning aggression and hegemony, he did not mince his words. This is how he demonstrated his moral convictions and a clear testament to the unchanging nature of American policy. From this, one can imagine the outline of America in the next stage of the war. Further extending this observation to the Far East, American policy will also remain consistent. It cannot be threatened by violence, enticed by the division of spoils, or swayed by the wavering intentions of Britain and France. Yesterday, a certain party propagated that American diplomats believed that after Japan was hit by the Soviet-German treaty, it would continue to advance militarily in China, preserve the interests of Britain and the United States diplomatically, and the United States would also accept Japan's willingness to cooperate with Britain and the United States, restoring normal political and commercial relations between the United States and Japan. The purpose of this propaganda is to use the smoke screen of so-called "American diplomats" to send subtle advances to Japan, implying that the United States would acknowledge Japan's military aggression in China and allow Japan to repair relations with the United States. Its goal is to use the United States as a bridge, sacrificing China, to seek compromise with Japan on behalf of Britain and France. Not to mention that the United States will never be exploited, and will never abandon its moral convictions or change its Far Eastern policy. Even the wise men in Britain and France would not make such a humble request, only revealing the wavering and shamelessness of those who spread such propaganda. These are not the words of American citizens, especially not the words of so-called American diplomats or other responsible officials. Nevertheless, judging from this propaganda, it can be seen that brewing is developing in many directions.</p>
<p>Given the tension in Europe, and given that non-democratic countries like the Soviet Union and Germany each abandoned Britain, France, and Japan for their own needs, it is understandable that Britain, France, and Japan are anxious to find partners. Given America's strength, it is especially desirable for Britain, France, and Japan to court it. Britain, France, and Japan have long been at odds due to conflicting interests in the Far East. Now, the changes in the Soviet Union and Germany have given Britain, France, and Japan a sense of shared suffering, which is likely to lead to a subconscious desire for mutual affection. Let's examine the forms and atmosphere: such propaganda as mentioned above is one sign; widespread rumors of easing tensions in Shanghai and Shenzhen are another sign; widespread rumors of the cessation of the anti-British movement are a third sign; widespread rumors of the possible revival of British-Japanese talks in Tokyo are a fourth sign; and the Tokyo military clique's deliberate claim that Germany is mediating between the Soviet Union and Japan, not just making things up, is a veiled threat to Britain and France, a fifth sign. These forms and atmosphere are too numerous to list, and it is expected that there will be more brewing in the future. There is certainly a clear path among them. Japan only needs to change its course, abandon its puppet regime, and completely abandon its policy of aggression. Then, not only will there be nothing that cannot be discussed between China and Japan, but the Pacific Ocean will also be calm. Britain and France will no longer have any barriers with Japan and can also help stabilize the European situation. What can prompt Japan to change its course? First, China's resolute resistance; second, America's strong and unwavering policy; and third, the dramatic changes in Soviet-German policy. What will make Japan cling to aggression is the wavering intentions of Britain and France! However, if Britain and France do waver, how can they shake China and the United States? Japan has no friends, Britain and France have friends, China has many friends, and everyone wants to befriend the United States. Today, the various brewing processes in the vortex of nations are focused on seeking good friends. Those who do not carefully assess the international situation may gain bad friends or even make enemies. China can never have too many friends, and it does not worry about having no friends. But Britain and France, in their hesitation, may ruin themselves!</p>
<h3>Nuremberg Rally Canceled, Germany Intensifies Preparations, European Transportation Disrupted, Berlin Implements Rationing, French Government Evacuates Paris</h3>
<p>Berlin: The semi-official German News Agency recently announced that the annual Nazi Party rally, originally scheduled to open in Nuremberg on September 2, has been canceled. Whether it will be held in the future will depend on the circumstances. (Havas, August 26)</p>
<p>Berlin: Today, hundreds of people gathered again in front of the Prime Minister's Office, seemingly waiting for something. However, no military or political figures were seen entering or leaving, a situation quite different from yesterday. Residents collected food ration coupons, which were distributed to each household by the authorities this morning. Housewives were greatly shocked, but the authorities tried their best to explain that this measure was not extraordinary in nature. Its purpose was merely to adjust the market and ensure the fair distribution of various foods. In fact, there was a good wheat harvest this year, and the country currently has 8.6 million tons of miscellaneous grains in storage, enough for a year. There is also no shortage of milk. Although today is Sunday, most residents did not go to the countryside for leisure because they were waiting for the situation to develop. As a result, there was more traffic on the streets than usual. However, private cars were insufficient due to the authorities' restrictions on gasoline sales. In addition, an international train left here for Belgium at 8:00 this morning. It is said that this was the final departure; thereafter, it will only run to Cologne, Germany. Political figures are unwilling to express their opinions on the situation. One official joked, "Everyone is shuffling the cards." (Havas, August 27)</p>
<p>Paris: Local morning newspapers, such as L'Intransigeant and Le Petit Journal, both published photos today of British troops arriving in France. Judging by their uniforms and badges, these British troops seem to be marines and colonial troops. It is heard that these British troops arrived in France aboard the British ship "Brighton" and have now arrived at Dieppe. It is reported that 2,000 British soldiers arrived in Dieppe yesterday, and together with those who arrived in France last week, there are now 5,000 British soldiers in France. (Associated Press, August 27)</p>
<p>Paris: Premier and Minister of National Defense Daladier summoned General Gamelin, Chief of the General Staff of the National Defense, and Vice Admiral Darlan, Chief of the Naval Staff, this morning for talks. (Havas, August 27)</p>
<p>Paris: The Ministry of Public Works recently issued an announcement with urgent wording, stating that all people, especially women and children, who have no need to stay in Paris should leave as soon as possible while transportation is still convenient. If they linger any longer, it is feared that transportation will be restricted. (Havas, August 27)</p>
<p>Berlin: National military preparations are still being actively carried out. The post office has suspended the receipt and dispatch of civilian letters from today onwards, so that it can focus on delivering mail to conscripted soldiers and recruits. Once this is completed, a notice will be published in the newspapers to restore normal operations. The railway authorities have also decided to reduce the number of passenger trains from tomorrow. The stations in the capital are very crowded today. In addition to foreign expatriates waiting for international trains to leave Germany, there are also many uniformed officers and conscripted reservists waiting to depart. Air Minister General Göring has ordered a ban on private German aircraft and foreign aircraft from flying over Germany, with the exception of air force aircraft, government aircraft, and scheduled German airmail services. In addition to military aircraft, flights must not exceed 500 meters in altitude. Special measures have been taken at Tempelhof and Königsberg airports for security. In addition, shipping between German ports and the Free City of Danzig has been suspended since noon today. The government has also ordered a ban on gas stations selling gasoline to private users. Gasoline stored in various places is being requisitioned by the government. Radio stations interspersed news broadcasts with military music recordings, which is similar to the situation during the Czech crisis in September last year and March this year. Hundreds of citizens gathered in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Prime Minister's Office, watching the constant coming and going of government officials and foreign diplomats. The situation inside the Prime Minister's Office was particularly tense last night, with work continuing throughout the night. When the crowd saw Air Minister General Göring, their cheers were the loudest. (Havas, August 26)</p>
<p>Warsaw: It is reported that the Nazi Party in Danzig has seized Polish grain, oil, and other goods stored within its borders. At the same time, news of border clashes is still frequent. Near Chojnice, a German patrol crossed the border and exchanged machine gun fire with a Polish patrol. Similar incidents occurred on the East Prussian border. One German was killed in each of the above two incidents. (Reuters, August 27)</p>
<p>Danzig: Anti-aircraft guns, previously hidden from view, have been moved into broad daylight today by order of the Danzig military authorities. This may be a prelude to the Danzig authorities announcing a merger with Germany. It is now generally believed that Danzig's return to Germany is only a matter of time. The streets are filled with martial figures. The music broadcast from loudspeakers in public places yesterday was mostly military music that aroused fighting spirit. At the same time, many Polish officials have moved out of Danzig. The German battleship "Schleswig-Holstein" is currently docked in the port of Danzig, less than half a mile from the Polish ammunition depot. (Associated Press, August 27)</p>
<p>Paris: Mobilization is proceeding step by step. While there is little sign of military preparations in the center of Paris, military activity outside the city is everywhere. Military trucks and requisitioned public cars and trams are moving in long lines. Troops are also being transferred busily. (Reuters, August 27)</p>
<p>Amsterdam: According to reports from Oldenzaal in eastern Netherlands, German soldiers are working busily on the Dutch-German border, building wire obstacles.</p>

<p>Berlin: The government has decided to implement rationing for certain daily necessities such as soap, coal, axes, boots, and shoes. However, people are still allowed to freely purchase bread, eggs, flour, potatoes, cocoa, and other foods. (Havas, August 26)</p>
<p>Antwerp, Belgium: German ships loading and unloading goods in this port have received orders from the German government to return to Germany immediately. However, Italian ships are loading and unloading goods as usual. The same order was issued to German ships in September last year during the international crisis. (Havas, August 26)</p>
<p>Copenhagen, Denmark: The German railway authorities announced today that passenger and freight traffic crossing the Danish border at Padborg will be temporarily suspended from 10:00 AM tomorrow. (Reuters, August 26)</p>
<p>Berlin: Regarding reports in foreign newspapers that the German government intends to move its offices to the outskirts of Berlin, officials denied it last night, saying that the government does not intend to take this measure. (Haitong, August 27)</p>
<p>Madrid: The German government has ordered all German merchant ships to dock in German ports or ports in other neutral countries. Three German ships arrived in Vigo today, and several German ships are also docked in the ports of Galicia. (Associated Press, August 27)</p>
<p>London: After receiving advice from the German Embassy, ​​correspondents from German newspapers and news agencies stationed in England returned home this afternoon. (Havas, August 26)</p>
<h3>French Reservists Continue to Be Called Up in Three Classes</h3>
<p>Paris: Three more classes of French reservists were called up today. (Reuters, August 26)</p>
<p>Paris: The Aviation Ministry has issued an order stating that the area stretching east from Calais, through Paris and Lyon, and reaching Marseille in the south, is prohibited from aircraft overflight from 9:00 AM on August 27. However, aircraft are still allowed to land and take off at the airports in Calais, Paris, Lyon, and Marseille. (Havas, August 26)</p>
<p>Rabat, French Morocco: General Noguès, the Resident General of Morocco, has ordered that all aircraft other than French aircraft and aircraft belonging to scheduled airlines are prohibited from flying over Moroccan airspace. The export of certain products and raw materials is prohibited, and those who have stored such items must register with local authorities. (Havas, August 26)</p>
<h3>Estimated Strength of the Anglo-French Allied Fleet</h3>
<p>London: At the start of a European war, the main force of the Anglo-French Allied Fleet will be more than double that of the Italian-German Allied Fleet. However, British naval experts acknowledge that the strength of Britain and France will be affected because the fleets of Britain and France must be responsible for patrolling vast coastlines. Accurate strength calculations on national navies are impossible to obtain as they are matters of military secrecy. Great powers are actively building ships, which makes accurate calculation of ship counts difficult. By tonnage alone, Britain's fleet is double that of the combined Italian-German Fleet. However, the strength of Britain's naval bases against the German air force and the fact that Britain must send a large part of its navy to patrol the Empire are important factors in the estimation of British naval strength. (Associated Press, August 27)</p>
<h3>Belgian Army Mobilization Order Submitted to Cabinet</h3>
<p>Brussels: The Belgian Prime Minister submitted an army mobilization order to the cabinet today. This is purely a legal formality. Mobilization will be limited to the actual replenishment of the army in stages, depending on the circumstances. In addition, there is a proposal to grant the King of Belgium special powers to maintain national security and defense in wartime. (Reuters, August 26)</p>

<p>Today in Chongqing, the Central Committee and the National Government jointly held a commemoration at 8:00 AM in the National Government Auditorium. Attendees included Central Committee members Kong Xiangxi, Li Wenfan, He Yingqin, Chen Lifu, Wang Chonghui, Jiang Zuobin, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaozu, Zhang Zhizhong, Pan Gongzhan, He Jian, Gan Naiguang, etc., as well as Interior Minister Zhou Zhongyue, Confucius' descendant Kong Decheng, and more than 300 heads of various central and national government agencies. President Kong presided over the event, leading the attendees in a formal ceremony. President Kong then delivered a speech on "Confucius' Teachings and the Future of the Nation." The original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Fellow comrades, today is the birthday commemoration of the Sage Confucius. The Central Committee and the National Government are holding an expanded commemoration ceremony. I, Xiangxi, have been ordered to preside and report. I will briefly discuss my personal thoughts on the relationship between Confucius' teachings and the nation and the people. I hope my fellow comrades will correct me. Throughout history, the establishment of a nation and the prosperity of a people must have a kind of spiritual power. Our country has stood for thousands of years, and although it has repeatedly experienced trials and tribulations, it has always been able to overcome all difficulties and stand firm in the universe. This is because it has been maintained by this spiritual power, and the emergence of this spiritual power comes from</p>
<p>Confucius' teachings. The development of our country's culture, the cultivation of national spirit, the maintenance of social morality, and all the theories and methods of governing the country and ensuring peace, all originate from Confucius' teachings. The Prime Minister devoted his life to revolutionary theory, which mostly originated from our country's orthodox doctrines. He also incorporated the spirit of modern science and strongly advocated restoring our country's inherent virtues, taking loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and love as the basis of the country, and righteousness, propriety, integrity, and shame as the means of saving the country. Wisdom, benevolence, and courage are to be used to build the country. They are both internally consistent and practically applied. In recent years, President Chiang, seeing the decline of the people's hearts and the corruption of social customs, launched the New Life Movement based on the Prime Minister's teachings, promoting</p>
<p>inherent morality</p>
<p>in order to rectify abuses, eliminate the old and establish the new. All of this recognizes that Confucius' teachings are the foundation of the country, applicable to all places and passed down through the ages without confusion. The government, recognizing this, has recently designated Confucius' birthday as National Teachers' Day by the Executive Yuan to show respect for teachers and the importance of education, so that the people of the country will have a model, and Confucius' teachings can be developed and promoted, strengthening the foundation of the country and revitalizing the nation. Today, at the Sage's birthday commemoration, I will briefly report on the most important aspects of Confucius' teachings in relation to the nation and the people, as follows: (1) Confucius' teachings and national culture. Our country is a nation with a long history and advanced culture, which is envied by countries all over the world. The reason why it has such a vast and splendid culture that will last for centuries is because Confucius is the only teacher. His most significant contributions to national culture are the following: (1)</p>
<p>Carrying on the Past and Opening up the Future</p>
<p>Confucius followed Yao and Shun, modeled Wen and Wu, followed the rhythm of the heavens, and imitated the nature of the land. He compiled the Book of Songs and the Book of Documents, established the rites and music, praised the Book of Changes, and revised the Spring and Autumn Annals. He comprehensively sorted out past systems, taking the essence and discarding the dross, so that later students would know what to choose and easily understand its mysteries. This had a kind of effect of carrying on the past and opening up the future in sorting out national culture. Not only was the culture of the three dynasties and above made more evident because of this, but the culture of the three dynasties and below was passed down because of this. His great contribution cannot be erased. (2)</p>
<p>Education for All</p>
<p>Confucius established his school in the Apricot Altar, with three thousand disciples, and taught all students regardless of their background, pioneering the education of the common people. When Europe was united by politics and religion, academic research could only be freely pursued in churches and among the aristocracy. Ordinary people had almost no opportunity to freely enjoy education. Only in our country, since ancient times, has learning been open and educational opportunities equal. Confucius once said, "I have never refused to teach anyone who can offer me a bundle of dried meat." He also never showed favoritism to his own family. Therefore, "Chen Kang asked Boyu, 'Have you heard anything different from your father?' Boyu replied, 'No. Once, when he was standing alone, I hurried past the courtyard, and he asked, "Have you studied the Book of Songs?" I replied, "Not yet." He said, "If you don't study the Book of Songs, you will have nothing to say." I retreated and studied the Book of Songs. Another day, when he was standing alone, I hurried past the courtyard, and he asked, "Have you studied the Book of Rites?" I replied, "Not yet." He said, "If you don't study the Book of Rites, you will have nothing to stand on." I retreated and studied the Book of Rites.' Hearing these two things, Chen Yuan retreated and happily said, 'Asking one, I got three, hearing about the Book of Songs and the Book of Rites, and also hearing that the gentleman distances himself from his son.'" He thought that his learning was not only for himself, so he could spread it to the people and pass it on to future generations. (3)</p>
<p>Perfect System</p>
<p>Confucius' contribution to our country's culture, in the vertical aspect, was the work of carrying on the past, opening up the future, and developing it. In the horizontal aspect, he taught all students regardless of their background and established the foundation of the education of the common people. In terms of educational methods, he established a perfect system that is still a good standard for education today. Since ancient times, education has been given in the six arts of rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and arithmetic, which includes the three aspects of moral, intellectual, and physical education without any omissions. Confucius also divided the curriculum into four subjects: morality, speech, politics, and literature, teaching each student according to their aptitude and abilities. This is more complete than modern scientific education methods, because now most specialized universities focus on the influx of knowledge and lack moral education. In fact, teaching people should put morality first. Today's neglect of the fundamental and pursuit of the superficial is indeed a major defect in the education system.

<h3>War Zone Enterprise Restrictions</h3>
<p>Chongqing: Since the outbreak of the War of Resistance, in order to maintain the original organization of profit-making legal entities, the government formulated the "Provisional Measures for Maintaining the Status Quo of Profit-Making Legal Entities during Extraordinary Times" and promulgated them for implementation. Its main goal was to prevent treacherous individuals from infiltrating and undermining enterprises. Since its implementation, it has achieved considerable success. The Ministry of Economic Affairs, for the sake of greater prudence, has separately formulated five items for restricting various enterprises in war zones or near war zones, as follows: (1) The change of name of each fishery right and mining right holder, or the transfer, mortgage, or alteration of its rights and interests, and the change of name of forestry contractors, state-owned mining right lessees, or those who have obtained special business rights, shall all be submitted to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. Any that have not been approved shall be invalid. (2) The premises and equipment of each farm, forest farm, pasture, fishery, mine, factory, or company, and the real estate in which they invest, shall not be used for other purposes or mortgaged to others without submitting an application to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. (3) The transfer or mortgage of shares of each company, or the change of name of shareholders, shall all be reported to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for record. Any that have not been reported to the Ministry shall be invalid. (4) Each company shall, in accordance with the law, set aside a sufficient amount of public reserve fund each year. All accumulated public reserve funds shall not be withdrawn or used without submitting an application to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval, and shall be deposited in a national bank. If they have already been deposited in a registered commercial bank or local bank and it is inconvenient to deposit them, an application shall also be submitted to the Ministry for approval and record. (5) If a company or other enterprise organizer or representative enters into a contract or deed with a foreign merchant regarding rights and interests, it shall be invalid without submitting an application to the Ministry of Economic Affairs for approval. The above five measures have been approved by the Executive Yuan, and the Ministry of Judicial Administration has been requested to instruct courts at all levels to take note. (27th Telegram)</p>

<p>Hong Kong: Although the Japanese Consul-General in Hong Kong guaranteed yesterday that Hong Kong would not be drawn into the vortex even if a European war broke out, civilians are still continuing to evacuate Hong Kong today. The Japanese Consul-General's statement was used to slightly alleviate the general fear that the Japanese army might take the opportunity to attack Hong Kong when a European war breaks out, but the fear has increased after the Japanese army continued to arrive in the New Territories last night. The Japanese army has now occupied the entire British border area from Dapeng Bay to the coast. According to shipping companies, all berths within two weeks have been pre-booked. Chinese residents in Hong Kong have begun to organize a "City Self-Defense Force" to help the Hong Kong government maintain order in the event of an emergency. (27th Associated Press Telegram)</p>

<h3>Germany Continuously Provokes Poland: Border Crossing Incidents Reach 34 in Two Days; Poland Says It Will Never Succumb to Threats</h3>
<p>Warsaw: Responsible parties here have recently stated that there have been as many as 34 incidents of German incursions into the Polish border in the past two days. The various news spread by the German semi-official agency Deutsche Nachrichten-Agentur, such as (1) Polish aircraft invading the airspace of the Slovak state to distribute leaflets, (2) extremely large numbers of Germans arrested in Poland, with 30,000 arrested in Brest-Litovsk and thousands arrested in Silesia and Pomerania, (3) the military authorities in Bielany occupying three factories run by Germans in Łódź and discarding the machines in the streets, are all not true.

<p>Danzig: According to German official newspapers, two German soldiers were shot and seriously injured by the Polish army within the borders of Danzig last night.

(27th Associated Press Telegram)</p>
<p>Warsaw: Today, the news of the signing of the Anglo-Polish alliance here is extremely exciting. A government spokesperson said that Britain has never undertaken such an obligation since the Napoleonic Wars, but it begins today. From now on, if Poland's interests in Danzig are slightly damaged, Poland will have to take appropriate and far-reaching steps. In Poland's view, the following actions are sufficient to damage Poland's interests: (1) attempts to annex Danzig into Germany, (2) not including Danzig within Polish customs, (3) transferring Poland's interests in Danzig to a third party for management, (4) interfering with the rights of Polish minorities within Danzig. The spokesperson also said that Germans in Danzig should obviously enjoy full cultural, economic, political, and internal rights, but the Danzig Senate's appointment of Forster as the head of state of Danzig is far contrary to the charter of the Free City of Danzig. Poland will determine its attitude based on the motive of this change. Germany obviously has an intention to accuse Poland of deploying troops for aggression and to shift the blame for war to Poland.

<h3>Japan Isolated, Again Flattering the United States; Ambassador Horiuchi Visits US Authorities; Declares No Incitement of Anti-Americanism</h3>
<p>Washington – Japanese Ambassador to the United States, Kenkichi Horiuchi, visited Secretary of State Hull yesterday. According to diplomatic circles here, the motive for Horiuchi's visit was to implore the United States to mediate the Sino-Japanese war. However, State Department officials are currently adopting an extremely silent attitude on the matter, fearing that China might suffer the adverse effects of a "Far Eastern Munich." (August 27, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Washington – The State Department announced that Ambassador Horiuchi of Japan held talks with Undersecretary of State Welles, declaring that reports that anti-American demonstrations in China were manipulated by Japanese forces were untrue, and that there was no information about a cabinet reshuffle in Japan. (August 26, Havas)</p>
<p>Washington – According to news received yesterday by diplomatic circles here, Japanese diplomacy has become isolated since the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact, so it has decided to promote friendship with the United Kingdom, the United States, and France. (August 27, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo – The Japanese cabinet is showing signs of reorganization following the conclusion of the Soviet-German non-aggression treaty. Hiranuma, Konoe, Yuasa, and Kurahei are very busy with this matter. It is reported that Hiranuma has decided to convene a special cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss this matter. If there are any resolutions from the cabinet meeting, Yuasa and Kurahei will often visit Saionji to report everything. Furthermore, Konoe also discussed this matter with Minister of War Itagaki yesterday. At the same time, Hiranuma also had discussions with former Minister of Finance Ikeda. As for Itagaki, he also consulted with the General Staff Headquarters and the Inspector General of Education. (August 27, Associated Press)</p>
<p>Tokyo – Japanese Minister of War Itagaki told a reporter from a certain newspaper that Japan's policy towards Europe will have to change after the signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression treaty, but in any case, Japan's relationship with the Axis powers of Germany and Italy will continue to exist, and there is no intention to abolish the Anti-Comintern Pact. (August 27, Haitong Telegraph)</p>
<h3>Polish Ambassador Visits US Secretary of State; Thanks for Mediation of Peace</h3>
<p>Washington – Polish Ambassador Potocki recently visited Secretary of State Hull and Undersecretary Welles, expressing gratitude for the US government's efforts for peace. French Ambassador Saint-Quentin also visited Undersecretary Welles to exchange views on the general international situation. (August 26, Havas)</p>

<h3>German Foreign Minister Receives Japanese Ambassador; Discusses German-Soviet Treaty</h3>
<p>Berlin – The Japanese Ambassador to Germany, General Oshima, went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs this afternoon at the invitation of Foreign Minister Ribbentrop for talks. The details of the discussions have not been released, but it is reported that the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Treaty was the main topic of discussion. (August 26, Havas)</p>
<h3>Yugoslav Cabinet Reorganization; New Cabinet Promulgates Orders</h3>
<p>After the Yugoslav capital city government recently reached a compromise with Croatian leader Maček, the cabinet has been reorganized. The position of Prime Minister is still held by Cvetković, and Croatian representatives have joined the cabinet. The new cabinet has a national unity character, with eleven representatives from the Serbian ethnic group, including four from the Radical Union Party, one from the Independent Democratic Party, one from the Bosnian Farmers' Party, and three from the former Radical Party who are non-partisan (namely, Foreign Minister Marković, Defense Minister General Nedić, and Secretary-General of the State Council, the famous jurist Konstantinović). There are five Croatian representatives, including the leader of the Farmers' Party, Maček, and the leader of the party's left wing, Doba. In addition, the Four Religious Parties of Bosnia also have representatives participating. After taking office, the new cabinet has already promulgated several orders: (1) to designate the Croatian province as an autonomous region, with only foreign affairs, national defense, finance, foreign trade, and transportation remaining under the control of the central government; (2) to dissolve the two houses of parliament and restore the people's political freedom to hold new elections in accordance with the new election law; (3) to extend the autonomy system of the Croatian province to the Srem province, making Yugoslavia a federation.

<h3>Japanese Residents in Berlin Leave Germany by Ship</h3>
<p>Hong Kong Telegram from Berlin: Two hundred Japanese residents have boarded a ship and are scheduled to sail to Denmark tomorrow morning. If the situation worsens, they will sail back to Japan. The Japanese Embassy has issued 300 gas masks to Japanese residents remaining in Germany. (August 26)</p>
<h3>Difficulties in Treaty Negotiations Between Hungary and Romania</h3>
<p>Capital City of Romania: After the government recently suggested to Hungary that they conclude a non-aggression treaty, the Hungarian government submitted a reply yesterday, advocating the conclusion of an agreement to resolve the issue of Hungarian minorities within Romania. Well-informed sources here have stated that the government may not consider this, as the government's proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Hungary was intended to dispel past grievances. If they were now to negotiate a minority agreement, it would be enough to provoke disputes and intensify past discord, which would be unnecessary. (August 27, Havas)</p>
<p>Capital City of Romania: Regarding the situation in Europe, in addition to publishing dispatches from the capitals of the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Poland, the newspapers here are paying attention to the following two facts: (1) Romania is willing to conclude a non-aggression treaty with Hungary, but it has been rejected by Hungary; (2) the Turkish authorities have issued a statement expressing their willingness to fulfill their commitments. Both of these matters are of great importance to Romania's relations. Regarding the first point, the Hungarian government has its difficulties. Even if its independence is threatened, it is not convenient to break away from the German-Italian axis and implement an independent and autonomous policy. Romania originally understood this. Regarding the second point, Bulgaria is surrounded by the Balkan Entente countries. Unless Germany and Italy promise to provide substantial assistance, it will not attack Romania. In addition, Turkey has already stated its willingness to fulfill its commitments, so Romania can rest assured. (August 27, Havas)</p>

<h3>Battle for Chao'an West Gate; Japanese Troops Repeatedly Ambushed, Suffering Heavy Casualties; Chinese Troops Bravely Attack Japanese Headquarters</h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Chao-Shan war has now entered a tough stalemate. On the 8th of this month, the Japanese side transferred 500 puppet troops from Guangzhou to Shantou, and then immediately transferred them to Anbu to guard various strongholds along the railway line. On the 12th, six Japanese warships anchored at Houzhai in Nan'ao, and 300 Japanese soldiers were immediately dispatched to build defensive fortifications around the island of Nan'ao. The Nan'ao Highway and airfield have already been completed. Fishermen are forced to work, whipped like cattle and horses. Those who suffer from heatstroke and cannot carry mud are shot publicly as a warning. Currently, the Japanese planes that harass Chaozhou and Meizhou mostly fly out of Qianjiang in Nan'ao. Therefore, although the Japanese side does not have an aircraft carrier arriving in Shantou, there are still a large number of planes bombing various places daily.</p>
<p>The Japanese troops in Chao'an failed to harass Fengxi on the 8th. The Japanese artillery stationed on Bijia Mountain and Hulu Mountain continuously shelled indiscriminately. More than half of the villages three or four miles away from the West Gate were destroyed by artillery shells. On the 9th, two Japanese planes flew low to reconnoiter the Anjie Road, and opened fire and dropped bombs in Tangkeng and Liuhuang, causing harassment all day long. Civilian losses were very heavy. On the same day, the head of the Japanese propaganda team was ambushed and killed by Chinese troops on the way back from Jinshi City to Guanchao. On the 10th, Japanese mountain troops entered Jinshi City, arrested and killed able-bodied men in retaliation. Eighteen innocent people were killed and their bodies were dumped in the creek, arousing public anger. Nearby strong men then took up arms and ambushed in Wuyang Mountain (next to the railway), launching an attack on Fuyang. At 11:00 AM, the mountain troops rushed back to support Fuyang City, and were intercepted by Chinese strong men while passing Qianjiang Garden beside the railway. After two hours of fierce fighting, the Chinese security team also launched an attack from Shaxi, detouring to intercept the Japanese artillery. At this point, the Japanese troops could not respond to each other, and more than one hundred were killed. After suffering this unexpected loss, the Japanese troops returned to Fuyang to gather the remnants, of which only a little over one hundred remained. Goto, the commander of the Japanese troops stationed in Chao'an, then ordered that the guerrilla forces along the railway from Anbu, Yangwei, Shaxi, Jinshi, Yuntishan, and Fengxi be cleared by August 30. It was found that when the Japanese troops attacked Fengxi Yuntishan on the 8th, they suffered a rout and abandoned more than 30 corpses. Yuntishan is on the side of Anjie Road, 8 li from the railway. On the 11th, Goto sent three hundred infantry, cavalry, and motorcycle teams, and engaged in fierce fighting on the mountain for four hours. The Chinese troops, taking advantage of their high position, annihilated more than one hundred Japanese troops, and captured many mountain guns, machine guns, motorcycles, etc. The Japanese troops retreated to Fuyang and did not return to Chao'an. On the morning of the 12th, the Japanese troops assembled the Yamaki artillery and the Japanese puppet troops stationed in Caitang City and Anbu, and launched an attack on Sangpu Mountain. The first formation of six hundred men advanced from Guanchao, Caitang, and Fuyang, occupying Hong'an Township as a base, and launching a fierce attack on Shaxi. Eight cannons were used to bombard the Chinese army's position behind the creek. The Chinese side had only three hundred or so security regiments and strong men, who used machine guns to resist, advancing wave after wave. By 5:00 PM, the Japanese troops had suffered another 170 to 180 casualties, one cannon was destroyed, and two machine guns were destroyed. When the Japanese troops left, they abandoned a large amount of military supplies. The Chinese side also suffered considerable casualties. The Japanese troops suffered repeated defeats, and their morale was depressed. The Chinese army then attacked the northwest gate of Chao'an from Yixi and Fengxi. On the 14th, the artillery followed up and fired shells at the West Gate Station, destroying a Japanese military train. A battle for control took place near the outskirts of the city. The northwest gate of Chaozhou city had long been almost completely deserted. The Japanese troops moved fir wood and sandbags out of the city to build defenses and hold on to the death. The Chinese artillery fired accurately, advancing to the station in one fell swoop, annihilating more than one hundred Japanese troops. The Japanese troops then retreated into the city to hold firm, and dispatched eight planes to drop bombs in support. The Japanese artillery on Bijia Mountain fired continuously all day long. At about 3:00 AM on the 15th, the Chinese army attacked the Japanese headquarters on Hulu Mountain. The fighting lasted until dawn. Japanese reinforcements arrived by waterway and outflanked Fengxi from outside the South Gate. The Chinese army immediately dispersed and retreated. At the same time, more than 600 Japanese troops from Shantou Anbu attacked Shaxi again, in order to hold back the Chinese army from attacking Chao'an City, and when the Chinese army retreated, the Japanese troops desperately pursued them to the foot of Sangpu Mountain. At noon, in the winding mountain paths, they were surrounded by the Chinese army again. The Japanese troops were suddenly panicked. The Chinese troops on the mountain took the opportunity to carry out a sweeping attack, annihilating more than one hundred Japanese troops again. The Japanese troops finally retreated back to Caitang City, but they were still tense and claimed that they would attack Jieyang. Due to the repeated defeats in recent days, they vented their anger on the strong men of various villages, and sent puppet troops to search and arrest them in the villages, causing great chaos.</p>
<h3>The German Ex-Emperor's Hatred of England and Japan: Is Hitler Following in His Footsteps? A Secret 30-Year-Old Historical Account Sheds Light on Today's Situation (Translated from the New York Times Magazine)</h3>
<p>Today's German leader is a staunch advocate of the Nordic race as superior to all others in the world. Hitler uses this philosophy as the core of his bold and great program. For six years, he has diligently rebuilt a nation that was defeated and divided twenty years ago, and has promoted and enhanced it. However, in the name of the Nordic white race, he has gained power and built his country, establishing two major axes: one is the Latin race of Italy, and the other is the yellow race of Japan. Mr. Hitler has completed a comprehensive military alliance with Italy, and has repeatedly tried to form a similar alliance with Japan, which is still in progress.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, Mr. Hitler's program is not new. Emperor Wilhelm II of Germany had already laid its foundation when he started the war in 1914. The Emperor also dreamed of vast sovereignty, intending to dominate Eastern and Central Europe, hating England as an obstacle, trying to break through the "encirclement," believing in the power of land and sea forces, indulging in power politics, and worshiping the idol of Teutonic hegemony. However, the Kaiser, who is now living in exile in Doorn, Netherlands, shakes his head whenever he hears people mention the Axis powers and Mr. Hitler's program. The Kaiser despises the British, but admits to hating the Japanese, and does not trust them, calling them "devils" and constantly remembering the "Yellow Peril." The Kaiser also believes that Hitler cannot obtain the expected assistance from Italy. Thirty-one years ago today, the Kaiser met with Mr. Hale, a reporter from the New York Times, for two hours, expressing this sentiment. His remarks were very harsh, stemming from anger and revealing obvious ambitions. However, this statement was never published in the newspaper. If it had been published at the time, the World War might have started six years earlier. This interview was not made public at the request of the German Foreign Ministry, the request of President Roosevelt, and the decision of the responsible reporter of the New York Times.</p>
<p>This interview contains letters, official documents, and memoranda, stored in the New York Times library for thirty-one years. Recently, it was discovered while sorting out other manuscripts. Its content can serve as historical material, and can show the fundamental differences in the psychology of the two leaders who were obsessed with German hegemony. Therefore, it is specially presented to the readers.</p>
<p>In the dramatic changes of the past ten years, we often forget the events in Europe in the ten years before 1914. We do not know that at that time, just as today, heroes competed, and there were moments that could erupt at any time.</p>
<p>Wilhelm II succeeded his father in 1888 at the age of 29. He was ambitious, arrogant, and disagreed with the Iron Chancellor Bismarck. In less than two years, Bismarck resigned in anger, and Wilhelm II took control of German policy. Bismarck had cautiously woven a network of treaties to isolate France and ensure that Germany could exercise military control over Europe. After Bismarck left, the Kaiser almost immediately alienated Russia, and soon alienated England. As a result, the two countries allied with France, and Bismarck's painstaking efforts were defeated. The Kaiser then dreamed of overseas colonies, and used interference in the South African Boer War to achieve his ambitions. He then occupied Jiaozhou in China, making it a naval base and a trade center. In 1898, he continued to threaten the United States, and there was a possibility of conflict in Manila. Soon, he acquired a cluster of islands in the Philippine region, and in 1899, he obtained two islands at the Samoa Conference. The Kaiser also engaged in building a navy.</p>
<p>England had a vast colonial empire, with a huge amount of annual overseas trade. Its power in China was growing, and it also held power in the Near East. Since 1874, Germany had gradually become a commercial power, and its position in world trade was second only to England. The Kaiser and the Pan-German League turned their eyes eastward and stared at the 16 million people of German descent outside the empire. Central Europe became the focus of their ambitions. They drafted an eastward plan, thinking of extending German power along the Danube River to the Turkish Empire. The Berlin-Baghdad Railway was its symbol. England saw it and was jealous, so it allied with France and Russia to obstruct it, fearing that Germany's trade power would grow and its political power would expand accordingly. The Kaiser then shouted, "Encirclement!" "Encirclement!" and engaged in expanding his naval program. England therefore suggested limiting the navy and signed a treaty with Japan. The Kaiser then declared that he would rather fight a war than accept England's command. This was the general situation in the early summer of 1908.</p>
<p>At that time, the US President was Mr. Roosevelt. Mr. Hale, a special reporter for the New York Times, was ordered to go to Washington and stay with Mr. Roosevelt for a week, writing several articles about Mr. Roosevelt's daily life. Later, in June, he was ordered to go to Europe to see if he could write articles about the Kaiser's daily life. He was a minister who had entered the journalism field, serving as a reporter and correspondent for several major newspapers, and was familiar with European affairs. In early July, after arriving in Germany, he learned that he could not write articles about the Kaiser's daily life, but he could be granted an interview with him. Because the Kaiser was going to Norway for his annual sea voyage, he followed him to Bergen and was introduced to the Kaiser on his yacht on July 18 by his friend General Löwenfeld, the commander of the Prussian Guard Corps, for a two-hour conversation.</p>
<p>Mr. Hale then wrote to Mr. Leach, an executive of the New York Times: "Last night, I was granted a special privilege by the Emperor to board his yacht and talk for two hours. The Emperor hates England very much and talked freely about the Yellow Peril. The Emperor said: 'England is a traitor to the white race. It will lose its colonies because of its treaty with Japan. The invitation of our fleet to visit New Zealand and Australia is to show England that these two colonies are managed for the sake of the white race and cannot serve the rebellious mother country.' The Emperor also said that he was sure that Japan was now inciting India to rise up against England, and the incident would occur within six months. Germany will cooperate with the United States to solve the Eastern problem. He and President Roosevelt have agreed to befriend China, so that China recognizes them as friends, in order to divide the East and make them hate each other. Negotiations are currently underway, and a senior Chinese official will come to the United States and Germany in a few months. The conditions will be announced and will guarantee China's integrity and open door. The world now knows that Russia is fighting for the white race, and it is fighting this war with great difficulty. It is a pity that its troops have no chance to attack the Japanese. If Japan gains control of China, Europe will be the first to suffer. He is now contacting the Muslim world, and he has supplied them with rifles, because they are brave in battle and their position is in the middle of East Asia, which can defeat the vanguard of the attacking army. Japan and the United States will fight each other within ten years.' The Emperor said a lot, I apologize for not recording it all. This matter is of utmost importance, without a doubt. I know it very well, so I am now going to Berlin, so that if the German Foreign Ministry wants to object before the publication, it can do so. At the same time, I believe that the Emperor is eager to express what he wants to express, and wants me to talk to him freely about everything. He usually hears very little, only through the courtiers around him. I feel that the Foreign Ministry will object to the publication, but I will do everything I can in Berlin. Now I expect Germany to fight a war with England. In my judgment, the Emperor does not mind the rapid outbreak of war. He uttered insults against England, endlessly, for two hours."</p>
<p>This letter, even if called an excerpt of Mr. Hale's record, is very勉强. The record shows the Emperor's direction of conversation and his emotional excitement. Mr. Hale said in the preface to his memorandum: "Even this is only a rough outline of what the Emperor said. The Emperor's mind is most focused on the new Anglo-Japanese treaty."</p>
<p>The Kaiser said: "Everyone understands what will happen between Asia and the West, that is, between the yellow race and the white race." If we are blind to this inevitable event, it is foolish. We have the sacred responsibility to maintain the civilization created by our ancestors for us, and the religion given to us by God. If we ignore it, we cannot face our ancestors or God. The whole world knows that the greatest crisis in the fate of the people of the earth is near at hand. The First World War has already taken place, but unfortunately it was not victorious. Russia fought for the white race. Many people did not know it at the time, but now everyone knows it. It is a pity that it could not fight a better battle. What a misfortune! God! I have always wished that my troops had the opportunity to engage in this battle and attack the Japanese army. We can win the victory in a short period of time.</p>
<p>What can harm us is not Japan, but Japan, which has become the leader of a united Asia. If Japan rules China, its threat to the world will be unimaginable, because that country hates white civilization. If we divide the East and make them hate each other, we are wise. At this stage, we must not allow China and Japan to unite with each other, or be close to each other, or for this country to engulf that country. The special responsibility that white people bear at this time is to prevent Japan from annexing China.</p>
<p>Great Britain is not worth mentioning. England is a traitor to the white race. Now a group of fools hold the government and are in an absolutely untenable position. I tell you now that the British Empire will be shattered on this reef. If England insists on its alliance with Japan, I do not know how the British Empire can avoid division. Private interests have entered through the door, and passionate patriotism has flown out of the window. I know that British Columbia has clearly stated that it must now govern the area with very mild measures. Otherwise, I will declare independence from England, and then everyone will know that the racial problem there is very critical. The situation in India at this time has openly shown its hatred of the British. If the Indians know the whole truth, their attitude towards the British will be more than just hatred. The special danger of India is directly due to the British government's alliance with Japan. The British government has taken this step, exchanging the quality words of dignity and friendship with an Asian nation on an equal footing, while forcing another Asian nation to be its slaves. India has long complained against England. Now this complaint has been used as an argument to incite the fierce spirit of rebellion against England.</p>
<p>I tell you now that I do not believe that England sincerely supports this treaty, but the fools who run the government are determined to maintain it. As long as England maintains this treaty, it cannot escape the position of betraying the white race."</p>
<p>Emperor Wilhelm also said that England's allies, France and Russia, were not reliable in helping to contain Japan. For this reason, the Emperor announced that only Germany and the United States could handle this task. Therefore, the Emperor spoke at length about the various reasons why Germany and the United States should strengthen their friendship.</p>
<p>The Emperor said in the meantime: "You once told me that a huge number of Germans, and men and women of German descent, are now a large part of the citizens of your great country. This has become a necessary unity between the two countries. We have the same temperament, the same religion, and the same race. Today, even in the nightmares of the agitators, we can no longer imagine the slightest shadow of conflict between us, or this possibility. Germany has no ambition to pass through, or even approach the scope of activities of the United States. Alas! Everything will eventually be realized. The future of the world belongs to the white race, not to the yellow race, the black race, or the brown race. It belongs to those with white skin and blond hair, to Christianity, to Protestants. Only our nation can save it. No other civilization or any other religion has the right to save mankind. The future belongs to us - the Anglo-Saxons, that is, those from Northern Europe."</p>
<p>The Kaiser then spoke of President Roosevelt, expressing his warm admiration for the American president, calling him one who possesses the most beautiful spirit of a new world. He then expounded his political philosophy, saying: "Everything in the world is often done by one person, that is, a person with a firm character. History in times of crisis often calls out one person. Everything awaits the appearance of a great man. Until a person rises up, a person with a burning belief in his heart, with a spirit of great fearlessness, not caring about being laughed at or misunderstood, nothing will happen. That person knows what he wants, and once he knows it, he will advance boldly to achieve it. ... This is the path of history. A great man has the power to accomplish everything. This is the law of social progress. I have told my people not to calculate whether it is an empire or a republic, but to have one person shoulder the heavy responsibility. The Congress can make criticisms, the Congress can not allow it, the Congress may even be wise, but the Congress does not do things. You can recruit the most knowledgeable people in the world into a chamber of Congress, but you can never get any action from a chamber of Congress. There must be one person to lead before you can." He then praised Roosevelt's personality and career, and said that the British nobles did not know him, and hated him very much, even the British king could not avoid it.</p>
<p>The Kaiser also mentioned pacifism and religion: "In the real world of facts, we must fight for the right path. The Bible is full of battles, and some of them are even wonderful. It is a misunderstanding to say that Christianity does not advocate war. Has Christianity ever opposed all wars? Early Christians did not hesitate to use swords to spread their faith. We ourselves were forced to convert. I am not advocating that we still use this method today, but how can our missionaries reach the savage lands if we do not win and, when necessary, use force to maintain the opening of the road for our priests? I tell you, our religion requires us to use all our power and talents, that is, our knowledge, our science, our tactics."</p>
<p>This record did not mention Mr. Hale's statement in his letter that the German Emperor detailed the supply of guns to Muslims, but only listed the German Emperor's ridicule of England and his anger at England's contempt for Germany's great desire to be an official.</p>
<p>(Translator's note: The following details the situation in which this interview was prevented from being published by the German Foreign Ministry, omitted.)</p>
<p>Mr. Hale later returned to the United States and visited President Roosevelt on August 12. Mr. Roosevelt listened quietly to Mr. Hale's report of everything, and was very happy that the German Emperor praised him, but he was very surprised by some of it, and firmly denied that the German Emperor had agreed to interfere in the East. Mr. Hale's memorandum, along with letters, telegrams, and reports of his meeting with President Roosevelt, are stored in the New York Times. This matter seems to have ended. However, later, because the newspaper slightly revealed this matter, it caused a disturbance in Europe for a while. After the German Foreign Ministry firmly denied it, it was restored to peace. However, the German Emperor's policy remained unchanged, and he diligently engaged in naval competition, believing that England had entered a bad fate, and more importantly, doubting that England would help France or Russia fight. Many people believe that the German Emperor's feelings contributed to the great outbreak in Europe in August 1914. It was too late when England announced that if the German army invaded Belgium and France, it would fight, because the German army had already begun to invade. The "fools" of England bore the blame. Five years later, these "fools" formulated the Treaty of Versailles, and the German Emperor lived in Doorn, Netherlands. Today, the new Great Germany that the German Emperor dreamed of building is ruled by an Austrian who was once a nameless sergeant in the German army. Everything still follows in the footsteps of the German Emperor and fulfills his ambitions. The only differences are two points: one is to hate Christianity, which the German Emperor respected, and the other is to befriend the Japanese, whom the German Emperor hated. Hitler not only concluded the Berlin-Tokyo Axis with Japan, but also helped Japan fight against China. The German Emperor once said firmly, "We must prevent Japan from annexing China." Today, Berlin does not even hear a weak reaction to this.</p>
<p>Translator's note: Hitler recently abandoned Japan and concluded a non-aggression pact with the Soviet Union, and the Berlin-Tokyo Axis was broken because of this. Although this move by Mr. Hitler cannot be said to be following in the footsteps of the German Emperor and severing ties with Japan, at least it has changed the policy of being pro-Japanese. The German Emperor brought trouble on himself because of his excessive ambition, but his remarks about Japan are of undeniable value. As for Japan, having lost its ambition in Germany, it may restore its old relationship with England. This has already been revealed in its words and deeds. England also does not want to break up with Japan suddenly. Recently, despite all the efforts to oppose the extradition of the four suspects in the Tianjin assassination of Cheng, England still did not want to offend Japan because of this and rejected it. Therefore, there is a great possibility that England and Japan will restore their old friendship. This will inevitably be condemned by the deposed German Emperor again.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Army at the Fairy Maiden Temple Stormed into the Japanese Camp: They Attacked Twice and Killed Many. The Japanese Commander Fled to Nanjing in Panic.</h3>
<p>Yangzhou Dispatch: A guerrilla unit of a certain Chinese army sent a commando team and a special operations team to launch a fierce attack on the Japanese army at the Fairy Maiden Temple on the evening of the 13th. A squad of the commando team took advantage of the Japanese army's unpreparedness and entered the Japanese army headquarters in the town, engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the Japanese army. In the dark night, dozens of Japanese soldiers were killed. Then the Japanese army surrounded and strafed them with fierce machine guns, so the commando team could not rush out and all made heroic sacrifices. However, the Chinese special operations team continued to guard to the Japanese army headquarters. The Japanese army responded in panic, and the two sides engaged in close combat, fighting bloodily all night. The special operations team also died in battle, with more than fifty casualties. The Japanese side also suffered many casualties. Limbs and broken arms were everywhere. After suffering this major setback, the Japanese army's vigor was greatly reduced. The Chinese army returned to defense and reorganized at dawn on the 14th, taking a short rest, and then planned to attack again. However, since then, in order to prevent the Chinese army from attacking, the Japanese army has transferred forty or fifty Japanese and puppet troops from Yang to the Fairy Maiden Temple for assistance every afternoon after 4 pm. At dawn, they returned to Yangzhou. They also transported more than a hundred shells to the Fairy Maiden Temple on the evening of the 15th, and set up two steel cannons and two large cannons on the South Beach. At night, they sent sentries on the roof of the Japanese army headquarters, using searchlights, and using telescopes during the day. If there was any impact, they would fire without a target. Their fear and panic can be seen. The Japanese army commander, Gui Ban, who was entrenched in the Fairy Maiden Temple, panicked after being attacked by the Chinese army. On the afternoon of the 15th, he took a car to Yang and went to Nanjing the next morning to ask for instructions.</p>

<h3>After the Government's Full Support, the Legal Tender's Foreign Exchange Basis is Sound. Making Every Effort to Stop Investment and Prevent Capital Flight. The Black Market Foreign Exchange is Insufficient to Represent the Status of the Legal Tender.</h3>
<p>After the Chinese government decided to fully support the legal tender and foreign exchange, the basis is sound and the whole country is stable. The black market foreign exchange is insufficient to represent the status of the legal tender. The financial markets in the interior have all entered the right track. In addition, measures are being taken to stop speculation and prevent capital flight. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Speculation Creates Shanghai Black Market</p>
<p>The sharp contraction of the Shanghai foreign exchange black market exchange rate is entirely caused by speculators and has long been unable to represent China's true external purchasing power. Today's foreign exchange buyers in Shanghai are: (1) Japanese merchants use legal tender obtained from dumping Japanese goods in Shanghai to purchase foreign exchange, (2) Japanese puppets exchange legal tender with Japanese military tickets and vouchers such as "Huaxing" and "Hualian" to obtain foreign exchange, (3) Shanghai Chinese and foreign merchants import foreign goods and need foreign exchange, (4) foreign exchange speculation merchants in Tianjin, Hong Kong and other places, (5) foreign exchange speculation trading by wealthy people in Shanghai. Except for the third item of foreign exchange needed for importing goods, which can still be regarded as legitimate, the rest are not related to China's war of resistance economy and have direct damage.</p>
<p>Insufficient to Represent the Status of the Legal Tender</p>
<p>The foreign exchange rate is a representative of a country's currency value, so China is determined to fully stabilize the foreign exchange rate and has established a Foreign Exchange Stabilization Fund Committee to handle it. Today, the statutory price of foreign exchange has remained stable, while the Shanghai foreign exchange black market exchange rate is insufficient to represent the status of the legal tender. Because the economic foundation of China's war of resistance is already in the southwestern and northwestern provinces, the economy of North China and Central China cannot be directly used by the Chinese government. For example, foreign goods dumping and exports are subject to control, and there are so-called "Huaxing" and "Lianquan" vouchers. The customs under their jurisdiction have been plundered. Luxury goods and non-essential goods can still be imported. The foreign exchange obtained from the export of local goods is not sold to the Chinese government.</p>
<p>The Legal Tender Itself Has a Sound Basis</p>
<p>The sharp decline of the Shanghai black market foreign exchange cannot be attributed to the status of the legal tender itself. Because the legal tender's cash reserve is still above 44%, which proves that the economic basis of the legal tender itself is very sound. In principle, the legal tender can never constitute a black market decline. However, the reason why the black market is constituted today is due to the special economy of the occupied areas. As for the main force of the fluctuations in the Shanghai foreign exchange black market, one is the bill market, the other is the foreign currency trading market, and the third is the gold market. The maintenance of the bill market is based on banks, the foreign currency market is mainly based on exchange shops, and the whole city is mainly based on money changers and silver shops.</p>
<p>Stop Speculation and Prevent Escape</p>
<p>In order to prevent the escape of funds, the Chinese government first announced concrete measures to stabilize finance, second, controlled foreign exchange and handled application matters, third, restricted withdrawal methods, fourth, allowed the remittance of banknotes from Tianjin, Shandong and Hanzhou to the mainland to prevent the acquisition of foreign exchange, and fifth, established a domestic remittance management committee to restrict remittances. The above five items are important methods to prevent foreign exchange speculation and capital flight. The Shanghai silver and money industry, in order to understand the government's intentions, unanimously complied. They also made every effort to encourage the internal transfer of funds to assist the government in completing the mission of building the southwest and northwest regions.</p>
<p>The Financial Market in the Interior is on the Right Track</p>
<p>The financial market in the interior is also on the right track due to the effective cooperation between government banks and local financial authorities. As for external purchasing power, the exchange of goods controlled by the government for export, the loans from friendly countries, and the inherent foreign exchange holdings, the Chinese government's external purchasing power has remained as usual since the war of resistance. The sharp contraction of the Shanghai black market foreign exchange is beneficial to the Chinese economy (1) reducing the import of non-essential goods, (2) making it impossible for those who acquire foreign exchange to use their skills. Although the issuance of legal tender after the war has increased, the cash reserves are still sufficient, proving that the Chinese government has never begged for a paper money policy, and the currency during the war has not inflated. The increase in prices in various places is due to the excess of demand over supply and the lack of sources, not due to the increase in currency.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Gold and Silver Imports and Exports: Export Surplus</h3>
<p>The Customs announced the import and export value statistics of gold and silver for July this year. There were no imports of gold coins, raw gold, silver coins, or raw silver. Exports of raw gold totaled 44,702 gold, silver coins 468,755 yuan, and raw silver 1,411 yuan. As for imports from January to July, there were 168 gold and 824 silver. Exports were 1,324,887 gold and 1,891,423 silver.</p>
<h3>Shanghai British Authorities Have Made Necessary Preparations So That They Can Cope Calmly with the Outbreak of the European War; Male Registration or Possible Evacuation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Times reports that while there is no reason for panic among the foreign residents of Shanghai at present, if the serious European situation escalates into war, preparations and emergency measures must be taken here as in other parts of the world. Therefore, the British Army, Navy, and consular authorities have taken certain steps to prepare for any eventuality. The British warship HMS Cornwall, carrying Rear Admiral Mowatt, commander of the 5th Cruiser Squadron, suddenly set sail just after 6:00 PM on Friday. Naval authorities here claim that the ship is sailing to Weihaiwei, but many believe that the cruiser is heading to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Two British Army Units Ordered to Prepare</p>
<p>There is also good reason to believe that the two British Army regiments currently stationed in Shanghai have been making military preparations for the past three days. It is reported that both the British East Surrey Regiment and the West Yorkshire Regiment (Prince of Wales's Own) are fully equipped and ready to move out immediately upon receipt of orders. If Europe avoids war and there is no need for the British troops to leave Shanghai, the current plan is to conduct the usual rotation of the West Yorkshire Regiment and the East Surrey Regiment in November, transporting them to Hong Kong and India on the British troopship Dilwara.</p>
<p>British Male Residents Must Register</p>
<p>However, military authorities claim that these plans are constantly subject to change depending on the situation between Britain and Europe. It has been decided that the West Yorkshire Regiment will be stationed in India, while the East Surrey Regiment will be transferred to Hong Kong to replace the Scottish regiment. The British Consulate has issued a new notice requesting British male residents who have not yet received a voluntary national service application form and wish to register to apply to the passport department of the British Consulate General for inclusion in the register of British men volunteering for service. Yesterday (the 26th), many British people were seen at the British Consulate applying for forms.</p>
<p>Considerable Doubt About How to Evacuate</p>
<p>After the departure of HMS Cornwall, the only British warships remaining in port are the gunboats Cricket and Gnat, and the destroyer HMS Duncan. News that Hong Kong is preparing to evacuate women and children to Manila has caused anxiety among many foreign residents in Shanghai, and they are very hesitant about whether they will be evacuated in the event of war and where they will be evacuated to. According to them, when war broke out in this port two years ago, they were sent to Hong Kong, but now it has been decided that even the women and children of Hong Kong will be evacuated to Manila, and the women and children of Shanghai are uncertain about where they will go.</p>
<p>Although Preparations Have Been Made, It Is Still Not Necessary</p>
<p>From the appearances, there is still no need to evacuate the women and children of Shanghai, but it is heard from reliable sources that the British authorities have made all necessary preparations to take this step in an emergency. The North China Daily News also reports that due to a misunderstanding, it was reported on Saturday that all British men and women in Shanghai must register with the British Consulate for voluntary national service. This statement is not correct. British women do not need to register, but those who wish to serve as nurses, or British women with nursing experience, should register with the British Women's Association.</p>
<h3>Japanese Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Chongqing, Arousing Public Resolve; The Cruel Propaganda of Japan Has Indeed Achieved Results; Every Bombing Has No Specific Target</h3>
<p>Foreign Reporter in Shanghai Speaks Freely About Everything</p>
<p>The Continental Daily News reports that a foreign journalist who has lived in the wartime capital of Chongqing for more than a year arrived in Shanghai yesterday (the 26th). According to him, since several months ago, Japanese planes have repeatedly bombed Chongqing, and the characteristic of these bombings is "absolutely indiscriminate." The Japanese plan for bombing Chongqing follows only two paths. The first path, which has failed, is to try to raze Chongqing to the ground and eliminate public morale through terror. The second path, which is still in progress, is to destroy the new residential areas of the city where many foreign embassies are located, hoping to kill Chinese officials and affect the activities of the central government. Since government offices are clearly no longer in the city, the Japanese are following this path. The reporter firmly stated that he had never seen Japanese planes hit a</p>
<p>Specific Target</p>
<p>Such as military or similar facilities. Japanese planes only drop large numbers of bombs in the two main districts of Chongqing itself and in the residential areas outside the city. Japanese bombers fly over the area in flocks, in a V-shaped formation, and systematically drop bombs, bombing everything within the fan-shaped formation without seeking any specific target. One of the main roads in Chongqing's commercial district, where there are no military facilities, has been repeatedly hit by Japanese planes indiscriminately dropping bombs from west to east. It is heard that Japanese pilots wait</p>
<p>Until Dusk Before Bombing Chongqing</p>
<p>Then they fly to Hechuan City, where the northwest waters of Chongqing meet, and soar endlessly, sometimes bombing it as well. They wait until the sky is almost completely dark, and then fly directly to Chongqing, a distance of only five minutes. This gives the Japanese planes two advantages: first, it is not easy for anti-aircraft guns and Chinese fighter planes to detect enemy planes in the dark sky; second, when Japanese planes enter Chongqing from Hechuan, they are already flying back towards their point of departure. The reporter went on to say that Chongqing was subjected to a night attack, and because he did not take shelter in an air-raid shelter, he was able to</p>
<p>Witness the Japanese Attack</p>
<p>According to him, there is telephone communication upstream of the Yangtze River to give advance warning of the movements of Japanese planes. Chongqing issues an initial air-raid warning at least one hour before the enemy planes arrive. As the Japanese planes fly closer, Chongqing becomes slightly disturbed, and then becomes silent to wait. Ships in the river quickly carry passengers to the safer south bank, while others with ample air-raid experience take shelter in nearby air-raid shelters. These air-raid shelters are carved out of the solid rock beneath Chongqing, and there are now enough air-raid shelters to accommodate the entire population of Chongqing, 100,000 people. At the same time, twenty or thirty Chinese fighter planes are divided into</p>
<p>Small Squadrons to Take Off</p>
<p>And fly around the suburbs to form an aerial defense line, so that the center of Chongqing can use anti-aircraft guns without obstruction. Fifteen minutes after the emergency warning is issued, twenty-seven Japanese bombers fly in formation. Because of the fierce bombardment of anti-aircraft guns and the active interception of fighter planes, the attack time is shorter. After the Japanese planes escape and the alarm is lifted, rescue work begins. Military police, ambulances, and first-aid workers go back and forth on the roads. Within fifteen minutes,</p>
<p>There Is No Rubble on the Roads</p>
<p>Fires are also being put out. The power to the bombed area has been cut off, and there is busy repair of the damaged power lines. The next day, Chongqing has returned to normal, and water and electricity have been repaired. This speed and effectiveness comes from experience, but it is inspired by the fact that every bomb dropped by Japanese planes on civilian areas is accompanied by propaganda. This inspiration has prompted the Chinese people to unite and fight hard against the aggressor who uses bombs to slaughter countless innocent people, destroy their homes, and destroy</p>
<p>The Expectation of Peaceful Living and Working</p>
<p>Of course, this is cruel propaganda, but during his time in Sichuan, he has seen this propaganda achieve the above-mentioned effect. The entire province of Sichuan has become an enthusiastic supporter of the war of resistance. Wherever bombs fall in China, there is no defeatist sentiment. There is only the excellent determination to follow the Chairman and continue the war of resistance until the invaders surrender.</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops Invade Punam in Six Routes; Chinese Troops Fight Heroically; Japanese Artillery Covers the Infantry's More Than Ten Invasions; After a Day-Long Stalemate, They Were All Repelled by the Chinese Troops</h3>
<p>It is reported that the Japanese troops are using new reinforcements from Japan via Shanghai to invade the guerrilla areas in the suburbs of Shanghai, and the Chinese troops in the suburbs have also begun a counter-sweeping war, so the guerrilla war in the four suburbs has become active again in recent days. According to information from merchants in Punam, a startling and heroic guerrilla war took place in Punam the day before yesterday. Six hundred Japanese troops set out from Shanghai to Punam. At about 4:00 AM on that day, they divided their troops into six routes from Nanjiao, Zhanggang, Qingcun Port, Xu Jiaqiao, Xin Chang Hangtou, and other towns, with more than 100 Japanese troops on each route, and invaded Taozhai near Qingcun Port, carrying a large number of machine guns and small steel cannons to carry out the so-called "sweeping war." At that time, a certain brigade of the Loyal Righteous National Salvation Army received information in advance and was ready to defend the area with a strong defense. A fierce battle unfolded. The Japanese troops used small steel cannons to bombard and cover their infantry's invasion, which was carried out dozens of times, but was repelled by the guerrillas with machine guns. There were three hand-to-hand battles, and the fighting between the two sides was extremely fierce. Starting in the early morning, the stalemate lasted until about 10:00 PM that night, when the guerrillas used night warfare to repel the invading Japanese troops. Both sides suffered considerable casualties in this battle, and it is heard that the brigade commander Li of that unit has been promoted to detachment commander by the Chinese military authorities.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Invade Qin Gong Tang East</p>
<p>The Japanese Zuehong unit of the Japanese army in Chuansha, Pudong, guided by the puppet "army" of Xu Hongfa, set out from Zhuqiao Town at the end of Shangchuan Road and invaded the guerrilla base east of Qin Gong Tang. A certain officer of a certain platoon's communications office was no match for the enemy alone and was stabbed to death and sacrificed for the country. The Japanese and puppet troops searched for a large guerrilla team but did not find them, and were afraid of being ambushed, so they quickly retreated to Zhuqiao.</p>
<p>Both Sides Used Machine Guns to Strafe</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, that night, a large guerrilla force advanced towards Zhuqiao, surrounding and attacking from three sides, with a very fierce momentum. Both sides used machine guns to strafe, and the Japanese troops frequently opened small steel cannons to show their power. The Chinese troops avoided the artillery fire and crawled forward. The two sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Because there were only thirty or forty Japanese troops stationed in the town, and more than a hundred puppet "troops" who had no combat power, they abandoned Zhuqiao and retreated in a panic under the encirclement of five or six hundred Chinese troops.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Fled Westward, Zhuqiao Recovered</p>
<p>They were planning to retreat to Chuansha, and on the way, they passed Dengjia Wharf and Jiangzhenwen, and were intercepted by guerrillas, who attacked from both sides, causing many casualties. They fled wildly to the west, without distinguishing directions, running and escaping in disorder. The Chinese troops pursued closely from behind until dawn before giving up. One part of the defeated soldiers, covered in mud, actually fled to the towns of Le'an Town, Tangmu Bridge, and Zhangjiangzhai on the border of Nanchuan. The Chinese troops won a great victory in this battle, and Zhuqiao Town was also recovered.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Yue Junwei Suggests Raising Funds to Exchange Postage Stamps; The Refusal to Use Postage Stamps Greatly Affects the Common People; Appeals to All Sectors to Raise Funds to Exchange Them to Provide Relief</h3>
<p>Lawyer Yue Junwei, in addition to practicing law on weekdays, is also enthusiastic about public welfare. Recently, in order to provide relief to the common people and exchange postage stamps for cash, he has made a special suggestion to all sectors. The original text is recorded as follows: Since the lack of copper coins, postage stamps have been used instead, which is a remedy for the inconvenience of circulation in the market and transactions. Recently, due to the publication of the imminent issuance of fractional banknotes, the postage stamps used as substitutes have suddenly been announced to be no longer in use, which is justified in principle, but has a</p>
<p>Profound Impact on the Livelihood of the Common People</p>
<p>Those who trade in fractional currency most frequently are vendors and peddlers, who are definitely ordinary people. The livelihood of these people depends on their daily hard-earned income. Once they don't, they may face hunger for a day. If they hide the postage stamps they have earned, and they are suddenly refused for use in the market, there is no way to sell them, and there is no need to send letters, and even those who use them as a daily</p>
<p>Selling Capital</p>
<p>What a serious impact on their livelihood! The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has realized this and proposed three measures, and has appealed to the postal authorities for relief, but the post office has only accepted the proposal to allow the use of postage stamps with leniency, and has not agreed to exchange and recover them, because it is restricted by laws and regulations. This matter is currently awaiting instructions from the highest authorities. Now,</p>
<p>What I Suggest</p>
<p>If the postal authorities do not allow the exchange, the public organizations in this city can organize a relief postage stamp exchange committee to solicit donations from various businesses and individuals, purchase postage stamps, pre-determine the amount, pay the money in advance, and give receipts. After the funds have been collected to a certain amount, a public announcement will be made to exchange the postage stamps, and the</p>
<p>Postage Stamps Obtained Through Exchange</p>
<p>Will be used to repay those who were solicited with receipts. In this way, those who are solicited will still get postage stamps of equal value, and will not lose anything, while ordinary people can exchange the unnecessary postage stamps for legal tender, which is of great benefit. In addition to donating 100 yuan to the relief postage stamp exchange committee for expenses, I will also purchase 200 yuan of postage stamps. This matter concerns the relief of the common people and the creation of benefits for society. In the spirit of "many hands make light work" and "common boat, common cause," I offer my humble opinion and hope that all sectors will consider it and give instructions. Suggested by Lawyer Yue Junwei.</p>

<h3>Yesterday Was Confucius' Birthday; Flags Were Hung to Celebrate; The Ministry of Education Stipulated It as Teachers' Day; Schools Will Hold Supplementary Ceremonies This Morning</h3>
<p>All sectors of the city commemorated Confucius' birthday yesterday, and it was one of the eight days of the year agreed upon by various groups and the authorities of the two concessions to hang flags. Therefore, all major companies, shops, and schools hung flags uniformly yesterday morning to express their celebration. Qingbai flags were hung everywhere, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. All agencies in the city, such as post offices, courts, customs, and schools, were closed as usual. Silver and money businesses and member banks and villages will take a day off today in accordance with the regulations of the guild, but the Central Bank will still work as usual and will not take a day off. The education sector also expressed warm celebrations because yesterday's Confucius' birthday was also the first Teachers' Day stipulated by the Ministry of Education. However, because it was a weekly holiday, no form of ceremony was held. Schools will hold supplementary ceremonies at this morning's commemorative week meeting, and will elaborate on the deeds and theories of Confucius, and the great achievements of his major contributions to the history of Chinese culture, so that students can generally understand the virtues of the sage and use them as a model, and even more, in this extraordinary period, the responsibility of teachers is great, and they should encourage and strive together to build a spiritual fortress, so as to promote national strength.</p>
<h3>The US Warship Marblehead Sailed to North China; For Routine Patrol Work; Hultman's Fast Warship Sailed to the Yangtze River</h3>
<p>The US Asiatic Fleet light cruiser "Marblehead" came to Shanghai from Qingdao on the 24th to purchase supplies and is about to complete its mission. According to US Navy Department news, "Marblehead" will leave Shanghai for North China at the end of this month to carry out routine patrol work. US Asiatic Fleet Commander Admiral Hultman's personal fast warship "Isabel" sailed out of the naval dock on the 25th for sea trials. It was originally planned to sail directly to North China to listen to orders. It is now known that the fast warship has changed its itinerary and will sail to various ports along the Yangtze River within days, so that the commander of the US Yangtze River Fleet, General Glassford, can meet in Wuhu. According to US Navy news on the evening of the 26th, the US Navy Department's three-in-one tank battleship "Charlotte" may visit Shanghai at the end of September. US fourth naval officers had previously been transferred to Qinhuangdao, Qingdao, and other places for summer exercises. It is now known that the summer exercises will soon be completed. The US fourth naval personnel who are training in North China will soon return to Shanghai to rejoin the team.</p>
<h3>Ordering Foreign Rice; Continued Registration; The Rice Market Was Closed Yesterday; Rice Prices Are Expected to Fall Today</h3>
<p>The Accountants Association has been accepting the entrustment to handle the registration of foreign rice orders. Although yesterday was Sunday and Confucius' birthday, it was still open for business as usual. Those who went to register included the Money Industry Guild (750 bags) and the Family Industry Society (80 bags), totaling 830 bags. Together with the 800 bags registered in the previous two days, the total is 1,630 bags. The initiators of the association plan to order from foreign firms as soon as a considerable number has been collected, so as to ship them to Shanghai as soon as possible to replenish the reserves and curb market prices. Yesterday was a Sunday holiday, and the rice market and management committee were closed for one day, so there was no market for rice prices all day. However, the arrival of goods from the river was more than in the earlier days due to the smooth negotiations of the authorities. The increase in the ordering of foreign rice has been realized, and people's hearts are more stable. It is expected that after the rice market opens today, rice prices are expected to continue to fall back.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Product Exports Can Receive Certificates of Origin; Trial Sales of Samples Do Not Require Certificates</h3>
<p>The Federation of Malayan Chinese Chambers of Commerce made some suggestions regarding the Ministry of Economic Affairs' rules for issuing certificates of origin for domestic goods. The Ministry replied: It has been noted. The details mentioned are hereby resolved separately. (1) The rules for issuing certificates of origin for domestic goods stipulate that although they are limited to industrial products, agricultural product exports can still be certified by exporting merchants in accordance with the rules for issuing certificates of origin for goods, and there is no need to stipulate this in the original rules. (2) Regarding the request to issue export certificates free of charge, if it is a sample for trial sale, there is no need to apply for a certificate. For goods traded in complete shipments, fees should still be paid as usual. The above two items should be complied with. This reply.</p>
<h3>The Zhabei Han Bridge Is Blockaded</h3>
<p>There was an old bridge west of the North Railway Station on Xinmin Road in Zhabei, which was an important road for residents in the inland area to travel to the concession. Therefore, it was very lively with pedestrians at ordinary times. Since Zhabei was occupied by Japanese soldiers, the section along the concession was blocked. The North Railway Station ticket office was changed to enter and exit from Qiujiang Road on the north side (between Gongxing Road and Huiwen Road). However, in order to facilitate the return of passengers from the News Bridge, this bridge was still open. Recently, various offices of the "Central China Railway Co., Ltd." have been built along the railway from Song Park Road via Wangjiazhai to Baoshan Road on the north side of the bridge. Moreover, fearing that guerrillas would mix in and cause obstacles, the bridge has recently been blocked. A wooden sign with the words "Central China Railway Co., Ltd." prohibiting passage has been erected at the end of the bridge, and there are also iron nets and other obstacles.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Ningbo Line German Transports; All Suspended; European Situation Is Tense to Prevent Accidents; German Consulate General Ordered Suspension</h3>
<p>The shipping department of the German merchant Lai He Foreign Company and the Far East Shipping Company in Shanghai recently received a notice from the German consulate that due to the tense situation in Europe, all German merchant ships should be temporarily suspended. Therefore, the Haifu temporarily suspended its voyage to Ningbo. As for the German merchant ships sailing on the Beisha Line, they still sailed as usual. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo German Transports; Ordered to Suspend</p>
<p>The German Consulate General in Shanghai, in order to avoid accidents for German merchants in the Far East Line due to the tense situation in Europe, recently notified the shipping department of the German merchant Lai He Foreign Company and the Far East Shipping Company in Shanghai, ordering all ships sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line to be temporarily suspended. After receiving the notice, the two companies immediately complied with it. As a result, the Lai He's Haifu Wheel, which was originally scheduled to start anchoring to Ningbo on the 26th, was temporarily announced to be suspended. The two German merchant ships, Moufu and Hana, are now anchored outside the mouth of Zhenhai. The company authorities have also telegraphed them separately, ordering them not to leave their current anchorage and to wait for the consulate's notice before deciding where to go. As for the remaining British and Italian merchant ships, such as the German Ping, Ende, Baoli, and Yingzhou, they all sail as usual without hindrance. Therefore, the Shanghai-Ningbo Line is still unobstructed.</p>
<p>Haifu Stranded in Shanghai; Destination Undecided</p>
<p>The Haifu Wheel of the shipping department of the German merchant Lai He Foreign Company had just been approved by the Ningbo Garrison Headquarters and was scheduled to start sailing on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line at 5:00 PM on the 26th. The day before, the German consulate suddenly notified it, causing the temporary suspension of anchoring. According to the shipping department, the German Wheel's ability to set sail depends on how the European situation changes. Passengers who do not want to wait can apply to the company for a refund, but the company hopes to be able to set sail as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Downstream of the Yangtze River; German Transports Do Not Stop</p>
<p>In addition to the three ships, Moufu, etc., on the Shanghai-Ningbo Line, the German merchants currently sailing in China also have many ships sailing on the Beisha Line downstream of the Yangtze River, such as the Jiangding Wheel of the Tongxing Shipping Company, the Haikang Wheel of the Keli Shipping Company, and the Kaisideng Wheel of the Haibi Foreign Company. However, the companies of the above ships have not received orders from the German consulate to suspend sailing, so each ship sails as usual.</p>

<p>Trainees Receive Free Instruction / Mechanics Are Encouraged to Participate Enthusiastically</p>
<p>The Industrial Division of the Public Concession's Municipal Council recently decided to hold a "Factory Industrial Knowledge and Safety Training Class," all to strive for industrial safety within the concession. Its purpose: to correct all errors in industry; to instill basic industrial knowledge; and to increase work efficiency. The training class is scheduled to begin teaching on September 1st, and trainees will receive free instruction.</p>
<p>Industrial safety is indeed very important. Although Shanghai has become an isolated island, the number of factories within the concession has increased compared to before the war, which is a fact. Everyone understands that improper operation of factory machinery can often cause great disasters. Not long ago, the Municipal Council held a "Safety First" campaign, emphasizing the practical aspect. Now, holding the industrial knowledge and safety training class also aligns with the purpose of this campaign. In order to understand some of the details of this training class, I specially took time to visit Professor Hu Yunsheng of Jiaotong University, who is the engineer designated by the Municipal Council. I asked him questions one by one, and he kindly provided clear answers despite his busy schedule.</p>
<p>A similar training class was held last year, and the trainees at that time were foremen in factory management, numbering over a hundred people. This time, it is the second session of the training class. However, the trainees in this session will start with the installation mechanics of manufacturing companies, and then proceed to train stokers. There have already been seven sessions of this type of stoker training in the past. This session's categories of training are more than in previous years, and the subjects taught are divided into: (1) the design of various steam boilers; (2) manufacturing steam boilers and improving past mistakes; (3) experimental welding engineering; (4) general knowledge and management of mechanical workshops; (5) mechanical installations and transmission of power; (6) experimental electrical engineering and its installation methods; (7) mechanical drawing. To explain the mechanical structure, a film projector is used to project images on the screen for easy understanding. The training period is a total of seventeen weeks, with one session each on Tuesdays and Fridays, from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM. The instructors in charge of teaching include Hu Yunsheng, Jin Zhixuan, Yan Liping, Huang Qiluo, etc. They are engineers approved by the Municipal Council, and their teaching is voluntary. Trainees who pass the training exam and do not miss classes in the middle will be issued a certificate by the Municipal Council as a form of encouragement.</p>
<p>Among the most important aspects of industrial safety, boilers should be given attention. If the boiler's inner chamber is not sturdy, and the stokers do not pay attention to the specified steam pressure usage, explosions can occur, resulting in casualties. Incidents like this happen several times a year. Before the war, a boiler in a certain bank's boiler room exploded, flying through the roof and collapsing the thick wall of a neighboring house. Fortunately, it happened in the early morning, so there were not many casualties! This kind of explosion is simply terrifying. The sudden occurrence is like a giant bomb dropped from the sky. To reduce the occurrence of this type of incident, the Industrial Division of the Municipal Council stipulated several years ago that factories with boilers must be inspected once a year. If any unsatisfactory points are discovered, the owners are instructed to hire workers to repair them. If it is already unqualified, it will be banned. In addition, regulations are set on the pounds of steam pressure to be used, so that the stokers remember them firmly.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Hu, the total number of boilers within the concession is currently estimated to be over 750, half of which have been added since May of last year to this year. The factories that use boilers the most are dyeing factories, weaving factories, and silk factories, most of which use them to drive prime movers. These factories have already started inspections. In addition, hotels and bathhouses also use boilers to generate steam and hot water, but inspections have not yet begun.</p>
<p>The engineers in charge of the inspection work are approved by the Municipal Council. Currently, there are nine Chinese engineers and more than ten Western engineers operating within the concession. After a thorough inspection by the engineers, they submit a report to the Industrial Division of the Municipal Council for record-keeping. It should be clarified here that the Industrial Division of the Municipal Council handles this procedure entirely as a service and does not charge any fees. As for the engineers, they charge a handling fee, with the inspection fee for ordinary boilers being 50 yuan per unit. It is heard that starting from September 1st, amidst the rising prices of everything, the inspection fee will also increase!</p>
<p>Looking at the many boilers within the concession, if the managers do not have experience and knowledge, there is a possibility of explosion at any moment, which would endanger the safety of residents within the concession. Therefore, the Municipal Council's decision to hold the "Factory Industrial Knowledge and Safety Training Class" does indeed have great significance and is worthy of our attention and approval. It is heard that the registration location is the Industrial Division, Room 602 of the Municipal Council (not the registration location published in the last issue). For the sake of industrial safety and their own work efficiency, factories should encourage mechanics to actively register and participate!</p>
<h3>Joint Organization of Customs Brokers / Through Transport of Goods to the Interior / Linking Jinhua, Lanxi, Yingtan, and Tunxi / Special Arrangements for Shipping from Shanghai and Ningbo with Offices Set Up Along the Way</h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese War, all coastal ports in China have been controlled by the Japanese Navy. In southern China, only the routes to Guangzhou Bay and Beihai are accessible. However, transportation to the interior is very inconvenient. Therefore, transportation has been concentrated in Haiphong in French Indochina. Although transportation to the interior is convenient there, there is a lack of vehicles, resulting in the accumulation of goods and difficulty in clearing them in a timely manner. Shipping companies and customs brokers have sought alternative solutions and opened up the Saigon-Kunming through transport. Goods are transported from Shanghai to Saigon, loaded onto trains in Saigon, and transported to Kunming for delivery. This is very efficient because there are fewer goods transported to the interior from that location, making it easier to transport out. If all goods are concentrated there in the future, there may be similar difficulties as in Haiphong.</p>
<p>As for</p>
<p>Eastern Zhejiang Freight</p>
<p>Originally, Wenzhou and Ningbo were the hubs for connecting Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces. Starting last month, the Oujiang River was suddenly blocked by the Japanese Navy, and the Shanghai-Wenzhou line was interrupted. The Zhenhai port was blocked, and shipping in eastern Zhejiang was almost cut off. Later, after the shipping companies requested, they were approved by the authorities to anchor and load and unload passengers and goods outside the Zhenhai blockade line. Initially, the restrictions were very strict, and two-way freight was sluggish. Recently, thanks to the</p>
<p>Authorities' Relaxation</p>
<p>Freight has greatly improved, and the number of passengers has doubled. It is now heard that Ningbo Yuanchang Customs Brokerage, jointly with Shanghai Yu Ji Customs Brokerage at No. 56 Yangxing Street, Xinchangyuan Customs Brokerage at No. 8 Hengyuan Lane, Tianjin Road, Yushungong Customs Brokerage in Yongan Lane, Yongan Street, and Yufengting Customs Brokerage in Sassoon Lane, Daijun Bridge, etc., have organized</p>
<p>Shanghai-Ningbo Through Transport</p>
<p>Connecting freight transport to Jinhua, Lanxi, Yingtan, and Tunxi. Special arrangements are made for all ships departing from Shanghai to Ningbo. Offices are set up in various places for transporting goods from Ningbo to the interior, providing care along the way. Customs declaration procedures are simple and quick, and transportation is stable and fast. It has already officially opened, and it should greatly facilitate freight transport in eastern Zhejiang, southern Anhui, and southern Jiangxi in the future.</p>
<h3>Charity Dance Competition / Opening of Yunshang Dance Hall / Extremely Exciting Program</h3>
<p>The Charity Dance Competition organized by the Fundraising Committee of the Refugee Relief Association's Dance Hall Group is scheduled to be held in rotation at the Valley Dance Hall. The Yunshang Dance Hall on the fifth floor of the New World Company in this city is scheduled to hold its official opening ceremony on the 29th (tomorrow) at 5:00 PM. At the same time, the Charity Dance Competition will be held first. All the red stars of the hall have mobilized to participate. At that time, Yu Qiaqing, the Chairman of the Refugee Association, will unveil the event, and Chen Yunshang will cut the ribbon. Movie stars Mei Xi, Han Langen, Yin Xiucen, Liu Jigun, Zhang Zhizhi, and Hong Jingling will be invited to perform exciting programs. In addition to Chen Yunshang and Mei Xi singing "Mulan Joins the Army" and Han Langen, Liu Jigun, and Zhang Zhizhi performing "The Three Musketeers," the audience can also request songs, which is rare. Tickets are two and a half yuan each, including a complimentary portion of Xindu refreshments. The Organizing Committee will also sell fortune fruit tickets issued by the Refugee Association as dance tickets, and all proceeds will be used to fund the relief of refugees.</p>
<h3>Land Broker Fails to Return Land Certificate / Accused of Fraud and Breach of Trust</h3>
<p>Zhu Ruiqing (also known as Zhu Guisheng), a local resident of No. 56 South Chengdu Road, who has been a land broker, was recently sued by Yu Fangben (30 years old this year), a local resident of No. 18 Yu Jialong, Wagner Road, French Concession, in the criminal court of the First Special District Court through lawyer Ma Junshuo, accusing him of crimes such as defrauding money and breach of trust, and including a civil lawsuit. The gist of the complaint is as follows: The plaintiff (Yu Fangben) owns an old-fashioned single certificate for a plot of land measuring 3 fen, 4 li, and 1 hao located at No. 18 Yu Jialong, Wagner Road, French Concession, which is plot number 9 and 19 in the Yunziwei, District 11 of the Special District. He entrusted Zhu Ruiqing, also known as Zhu Guisheng, the defendant, who was acting as a land broker, to exchange it for a land certificate from the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau. The defendant claimed that the plaintiff was unfamiliar with the procedures and young and easily deceived. He initially demanded a tip of five hundred yuan. Then, he used delaying tactics for several years, and the plaintiff's demands were ineffective. Recently, he even took advantage of the case of Yao Zhijiang's mutual aid fund execution, No. 106 in the enforcement order of the Second Special District Court, to collude with Yao and falsely claimed that the plaintiff had mortgaged the land to the defendant for 2,040 yuan, which the defendant had already obtained on behalf of the plaintiff, and audaciously applied for the auction to participate in the distribution. Not only is there no deed to prove the alleged mortgage, but there is also no actual debt. The defendant's actions were actually taking advantage of the opportunity to handle affairs for others, violating his duties, and intending to obtain illegal benefits for himself. He is clearly guilty of violating Article 339, Paragraph 1, and Article 342 of the Criminal Law. Therefore, he is filing a private prosecution in accordance with the law, requesting that the defendant be punished for his crimes, and including a civil lawsuit requesting that the defendant be ordered to return the land certificate No. 2325 and the cadastral map. The court will summon the defendant for questioning in the coming days. At the same time, the plaintiff Yu Fangben also applied to the civil court of the Second Special District Court for preservation of evidence, that is, the land certificate No. 2335 and the cadastral map, to prevent Zhu Ruiqing from claiming them.</p>
<h3>Application for National Goods Certificate / To be Filled Out Once Every Six Months</h3>
<p>The China National Goods Production and Sales Association requested the Ministry of Economic Affairs to stipulate the validity period of the national goods certificate by telegram. Now, the Ministry has approved and replied, "Received. Regarding the request to stipulate the issuance of national goods certificates, as the conditions of factories vary in different regions, it is not appropriate to include them in the regulations. We now set a temporary method as follows: (1) Manufacturers who have already obtained national goods certificates should fill out a statement of items once every six months and submit it to the Ministry for record. The form is the same as the statement of items that should be included when applying for a national goods certificate. (2) The completed statement of items should be submitted by the local competent authority for forwarding, or sent directly for review after being certified by a legitimate local industrial and commercial organization. The certification procedures are handled in accordance with the methods for filling out and submitting the statement of items for applying for a national goods certificate. Please follow this and inform the members of the association to comply." This is the approval.</p>
<h3>The Hongqiao Road Golf Club / All Chinese Staff Arrested / Japanese Army Searched but Found Nothing</h3>
<p>The Hongqiao Township Golf Club in western Shanghai, organized by foreigners living in Shanghai, covers an area of approximately 300 mu. Many foreigners go there to play golf every Saturday afternoon and Sunday. The club employs about 40 Chinese staff members (servants, head clerks, coolies, etc.). It is currently headed by Mr. 克明 (transliteration), the president of the British Residents' Association. However, on the 25th in the afternoon, Nishimura, the commander of the Japanese army garrison on Lincoln Road, dispatched dozens of Japanese soldiers to search the club. As a result, they found nothing. They then arrested all 40-plus staff members, including the head servant Liu A'de, and escorted them to the Japanese army headquarters for interrogation. The reason for the arrest is unknown.</p>

<h3>Owners of the Heng'an Yarn Shop, etc. / Accused of Embezzlement and Perjury / Anle Factory Purchased Yarn but Did Not Receive Delivery / Awaiting the Suspension of Civil Case Files for Further Interrogation</h3>
<p>Zhang Houqin, the manager of the Anle Textile Factory at No. 1, Lane 439, Ningbo Road, had, since August 17th of last year, successively ordered cotton yarn from Dai Ren'an, the owner of the Heng'an Yarn Shop at No. 60 Zunder Lane, Xiamen Road, valued at 6,417.84 yuan. However, Anle did not receive the goods that were due to be delivered, while Heng'an Shop claimed that they had already been paid in full.</p>
<p>Leading to a Dispute</p>
<p>Resulting in litigation in the civil court of the First Special District Court. When the civil court was in session, Dai produced a witness, Shen Shende, to testify in court that the cotton yarn ordered by Anle had already been delivered. The delivery locations were inside the Xin'jing, Ri'xin, and An'shen warehouses, and it was loaded and transported by Anle Factory's own truck No. 20469, leading Anle to lose the case. However, the Anle Factory side stated that although the truck number was indeed owned by their factory, the endorsement for the</p>
<p>Shipping Period</p>
<p>The registration information of the truck still existed in the Donation Office, how could it be used to transport goods, clearly his statement was false. They reported to the Lao Zha police station, and after investigation by the Chinese detective Zhang Keqin, they requested the First Special District Court to issue a subpoena. Yesterday, Dai and Shen were summoned to the Criminal Division 4 of the First Special District Court, and Judge Zhong Qing presided over the trial. The lawyer of the police station, Zhang Shizhu, prosecuted them separately for embezzlement and perjury. After Judge Zhong's interrogation, it was decided to postpone the trial because the civil case files still needed to be suspended.</p>

<h3>Nanto Maru / Set on Fire / But No Disaster</h3>
<p>The Nisshin Company's Nanto Maru arrived in Shanghai from Nantong yesterday afternoon. When it arrived at the Wusongkou at 1:00 PM, the deck was suddenly set on fire, and several sulfur bombs were discovered. Fortunately, it was discovered early, and it was on the deck, so it did not cause a major disaster and was extinguished immediately. When the ship arrived at the Yangtze Wharf in Pudong at 3:00 PM, the Japanese army on shore, upon receiving the report, suddenly imposed an emergency curfew, prohibiting pedestrians from entering the wharf and ordering all passengers and crew members to line up on the wharf and undergo a strict search one by one, which lasted for about two hours. However, nothing was found, and the passengers were released. The ship carried more than a dozen Japanese soldiers and more than 300 passengers on this trip from Nantong, with more than a thousand pieces of cloth produced by the Dasheng Yarn Factory, and more than 3,000 chickens and ducks in terms of goods.</p>
<h3>A Truck Full of Flour / Robbed Clean / Many Poor People Detained</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 25th, a truck loaded with more than a hundred bags of flour stopped in front of the Tongwen Academy on Hongqiao Road in western Shanghai to unload. Just as the coolies were carrying it, many poor men, women, old, and young people from nearby rushed up and robbed the flour, carrying it away on their shoulders. The truck driver and workers blew the whistle and shouted for arrest. Upon hearing the alarm, the Xujiahui French police station immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to the scene and detained eleven people, including Chen Wensheng, Jiang Xiaofa, Li Zhonglin, Yang Yunshan, Sheng Zeying from Anhui Province, Wan Qizhi from Hebei Province, Yang Gensheng from Nanjing, Gong Shengshi, Wang Heshi, and Kuai Liushi from Anhui Province. They were brought into the police station together with the stolen flour. The lawyer of the French Concession Administrative Authority, Gu Shouxi, stated the facts of the case and requested a postponement of the investigation before bringing the case to trial. After Judge Miao Qingbang's interrogation, he instructed that the trial be postponed to September 5th. The defendants were detained.</p>
<h3>Farmlands of Villagers in Dachang Township / Completely Occupied</h3>
<p>More than a thousand mu of farmland and villages in Dachang Town, about three li north of Baoshan County, have been converted into an airfield, the villagers there were unable to return to their homes and were all crying bitterly. According to the villagers there, all the villages, large and small, east of the town to Jiangwan have recently been occupied by Taiwanese and Japanese. The villagers are all falsely accused of being guerrillas and are not allowed to live there. All the farmlands have also been seized. The Japanese plant cotton, and the Taiwanese grow vegetables for the Japanese to eat. Therefore, the villagers are all crying out in unison.</p>
<h3>The Dashing Thief / The Jiang Jianqiu Case / The Appeal is Scheduled for Trial</h3>
<p>The dashing thief Jiang Jianqiu was sentenced to five years in prison by the First Special District Court in May of this year after being detained by the Public Concession Police for committing dozens of cases of enticing prostitutes, dancing girls, tour guides, female performers, mistresses of wealthy families, etc. and stealing, robbing, etc. in the two concessions. Later, he was brought by the French Concession Police to the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court for public prosecution on charges of theft, fraud, and robbery. The swindled female performers Yu Guifen, Yao Yuchan, and the rich man's concubine Jinxiang, etc. did not appear in court. The judge in charge of the case, Qiu Huan'ying, ruled after the trial that Jiang was sentenced to nine years in prison for the robbery portion. As for the theft and fraud portions, although Jiang confessed without concealment, because the First Special District Court had already sentenced him for continuous crimes, it was ruled to dismiss the charges. Jiang, feeling unwilling to be sentenced to nine years in prison for the robbery portion, hired lawyer Zhang Qieping to file an appeal to the Third High Court, requesting a reduction. It is now learned that the Third High Court has approved the request and has scheduled to bring Jiang Jianqiu to trial on September 4th at 9:00 AM. The end of this sensational dashing thief case is not far off. It is still difficult to predict whether the swindled Yu Guifen, etc. will appear in court to confront him.</p>

<p>Teacher's Day Telegram of Consolation to Teachers Nationwide from the Minister of Education</p>
<p>Chongqing, 27th dispatch</p>
<p>Chen Lifu, Minister of Education, telegraphed to teachers across the country to express his consolation and encouragement. The original telegram is recorded below: "To all teachers of schools at all levels across the country, the Central Government has decided to designate Confucius' birthday as the Teachers' Commemorative Day of the Republic of China. This is because Confucius established a model of tireless spirit, setting an example of self-establishment and helping others to stand, removing treacherous officials and revitalizing human relations, distinguishing between barbarians and Chinese and upholding righteousness. Therefore, he can be a teacher for all generations and his influence can be felt across the four seas. Now, as you face a time when enemy troops are rampant and the country is in turmoil, whether you are raising your arms and braving the enemy's weapons, or carrying children on your backs to preserve learning, resisting aggression and building the nation are equally important. The patriotic enthusiasm shown by teachers in the war zones is particularly admirable, inspiring the people. We predict that our nation will surely prosper, and the trend of righteousness indicates that the island barbarians are exhausted. Let us work together to achieve this success and jointly wish for the eternal prosperity of our nation, laying this initial foundation. I respectfully send this telegram to express my condolences and wish you good health." [Signed] Chen Lifu, with seal.</p>
<p>Publication of a Letter to All School Tutors</p>
<p>Chongqing, 27th dispatch</p>
<p>Today is Teacher's Day, and Minister Chen of Education has published a letter to all school tutors. The gist is as follows: "Lifu, serving in a key position, is in charge of education. Thinking about the long-term plans for a hundred years, he believes that it is necessary to correct the root and purify the source, follow the legacy of ancient teachers, and adopt the good rules of learning from other countries. Therefore, on March 28 last year, he promulgated the tutor system in secondary and higher education institutions nationwide. The tutor system has ensured that those responsible for moral education are the right people. At the same time, this Ministry, recognizing that the goals of moral education in the past have not been clearly defined, has also formulated and promulgated outlines for moral education at all levels of schools, so that those responsible have something to follow, and those who teach have a path to follow. It is hoped that rule by man and rule by law will complement each other, and that teaching by establishing oneself and helping others will be for the country. All comrades in schools across the country who serve as tutors must use the spirit of tireless teaching to seek the ultimate joy of educating talents, set this as their goal, and work together to achieve it."</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Continues to Conduct Registration of Higher Education Students in War Zones, with Provincial Education Departments Holding Their Own Registration on a Timetable</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Ministry of Education considers that there are still many students from specialized schools and above in the war zones who have lost their schooling and are wandering around, and has decided to continue registration to provide relief.

<h3>Mongolian and Tibetan Schools Renamed Border Schools</h3>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) The Mongolian and Tibetan School has recently received an order from the Central Political School, which in turn received an order from the Central Government. The school currently admits students from ethnic groups other than Mongolian and Tibetan, such as Hui students. The name "Mongolian and Tibetan School" is not sufficient to encompass other ethnic groups, and it should be renamed "Border School." The Suzhou, Xining, Kangding, Baotou, and Dali branch schools, originally managed by the Central Political School, will be placed under the jurisdiction of the Border School and renamed Suzhou, Xining, Kangding, Baotou, and Dali Branch Schools of the Border School to clarify the system and conform to reality.</p>

<h3>Tensions in Europe, the Hong Kong-Shanghai Swimming Competition Canceled Again, Preliminary Round Also Suspended</h3>

<h3>Promoting the Pasta Movement</h3>
<p>— Mangmang</p>
<p>The continuous rise in rice prices has made some poor people feel the threat to their lives. The increasing trend of snatching rice shows that they have been forced to a dead end. If they are forced further, perhaps something even more violent than snatching rice will happen. Social tranquility will become even more unsustainable.</p>
<p>How can this panic be resolved? Generally speaking, only (1) should the Public Works Department use its power to eliminate the control of rice transported from the mainland to Shanghai; (2) effectively eliminate hoarding; (3) increase labor compensation. As for purchasing Saigon rice to regulate the market, it is really not a good idea at this time of plummeting foreign exchange reserves. Judging from the situation in the past one or two months, the above points are difficult to achieve in a short period of time.</p>
<p>However, the urgent and serious livelihood problem cannot be delayed any longer. Then, "promoting the pasta movement," under helpless circumstances, also has a bit of "emergency relief" value.</p>
<p>Perhaps some people will object to this proposal, and their reason must be: "Southerners are used to eating rice and are not used to eating pasta." This is certainly true, but what if there is no rice? At that time, will they not only be able to bear the pain of not eating rice? The ready-made example is not far from the eyes. After August 13th, white rice was once cut off, and people were not forced to eat pasta. It can be seen that "being unaccustomed to it is a small matter, starvation is a big matter"!</p>
<p>Of course, it is undeniable that pasta is difficult to make and difficult to eat; in fact, if it can be made habitually, today make noodles, baked cakes, tomorrow make pancakes, steamed buns, changing the taste every day, it can be eaten habitually.</p>
<p>How to make pasta? This is a technical problem, and so few people in Shanghai know this technique. To solve this difficulty, it must be done step by step. As far as I can think of, the following attempts can be made:</p>
<p>(1) Newspapers should introduce more common sense about making pasta, such as how much yeast powder to put on a certain amount of flour when making steamed buns, and how much salt to put when making pancakes.</p>
<p>(2) Lunches can be partially replaced with pasta, because most people already feel burdened by a lunch of 20 or 30 yuan; if pasta can be used instead to reduce the price, the eaters can reduce their burden, and their business scope can be expanded as a result. Small restaurants may also wish to try it.</p>
<p>(3) Families can make it themselves. If they do not know how to make it, they may wish to have some "consumer cooperation." Within a house, jointly hire a short-term worker who makes pasta (it is best to work only before lunch and dinner to avoid conflicting with the worker's original working hours, because the remuneration can be lighter), and the variety of dishes can be changed. Or several families can cooperate to hire a pasta worker. After learning it yourself, you can do it yourself.</p>
<p>(4) As a compromise, you can have rice for one meal and pasta for another.</p>
<p>If you can endure it for a while, habits will slowly develop. After pasta becomes popular, the consumption of rice will be reduced, and the price of rice will also decrease. In addition, because pasta is relatively simple, firewood, oil, sauce, vegetables, etc. can also save a lot.</p>
<p>However, the lesson of rice must be taken into account, that is to say, after pasta becomes popular, it is difficult to guarantee that the price of flour will not rise. This depends on the Public Works Department's efforts, because the existing flour reserves are sufficient for two or three months. If the Public Works Department can purchase and sell them at a fair price, it will be a great merit for the livelihood of the poor.</p>
<h3>Celebrities' Clothing</h3>
<p>— Nianyun</p>
<p>Chairman Lin, who is highly respected, always wears a gown, whether he is in the office or resting; in the spring, he likes to wear a thin blue cotton gown, in the summer it is a white summer cloth long shirt, in the autumn he wears a thin silk cotton gown, and in the winter he wears a sheepskin robe, sometimes with a black wool coat.</p>
<p>Our leader, President Chiang, usually likes to wear Zhongshan suits and long shirts. He rarely wears simple military uniforms. In the hot summer season, he always wears a summer cloth long shirt; in short, his clothes are extremely civilian.</p>
<p>General Feng Yuxiang, Deputy Chairman of the Central Military Commission, is frugal by nature and does not like to wear long gowns and silk fabrics; he usually wears short clothes, especially in winter, a short cloth jacket and a cloth belt, looking very much like a villager; one year, when Feng entered Beijing, General Li Liejun gave him a set of sky-blue silk long gown and black satin short jacket. Feng wore the robe and jacket given by General Li to pay homage to Hu Hanmin and to the opening of the Central Plenary Session, as well as the three major ceremonies of visiting the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.</p>
<h3>Idle Chat About Handkerchiefs</h3>
<p>— Shen Xishen</p>
<p>The purpose of a handkerchief is to wipe away tears and saliva, and to mop up sweat. Therefore, whether men, women, the old, or children, everyone needs to have one ready. Especially when going out or attending banquets, if you forget to bring your handkerchief, you will feel very inconvenienced!</p>
<p>In the past, most people used white handkerchiefs. In recent years, however, handkerchiefs of various colors have become popular. Red, yellow, blue, and green, a riot of colors! Some are woven into squares or stripes, others are printed with various figures and flowers, and still others are embroidered with extremely exquisite designs. You can choose the pattern that you find most pleasing according to your own preferences. However, the material of handkerchiefs is always one of two types: silk or cotton. (I have never seen woolen handkerchiefs.) However, they come in different sizes. Men usually prefer larger sizes to show a generous and refined demeanor, while women prefer smaller sizes, finding them delicate and convenient.</p>
<p>Besides being used for wiping, handkerchiefs can also be used as decorations. For example, trendy young people often have a fine small handkerchief half-exposed in the left breast pocket of their Western-style suit. This handkerchief is certainly not for wiping.</p>
<p>Presenting a handkerchief as a gift to relatives, friends, or lovers to keep as a memento seems to express a deep and lasting meaning! And there is also the moment when your close relative or close friend is about to leave you for a long journey, and you are at the pier or station to see them off! The sorrow of parting, the helplessness of separation, a whistle blows, and the person departs! At this time, you can only raise and wave the handkerchief in your hand high to express your farewell. As the saying goes, "What dims the soul is only separation!" This is yet another function of the handkerchief!</p>
<h3>Walking</h3>
<p>— Xinliang</p>
<p>In the past, when I was studying at middle school, because I had lunch at school, I had more than an hour of free time after the meal. To use this hour or so for studying would be too boring. To use it for playing ball and other sports seemed too unsafe for my body, with intense jumping and movement right after eating. Therefore, at that time, I would often gather two or three close friends, play the harmonica, or go to the Bund Park for a walk and relaxation (my alma mater was very close to the Bund Park).</p>
<p>Indeed, this hour or so of walking gave my body and mind a great deal of pleasure and comfort. Now, however, due to my job, this kind of walking is no longer possible.</p>
<p>Leisurely, carefree walking can not only refresh our tired minds, but also give our bodies some exercise (not strenuous). Our muscles can develop as a result, and our blood circulation can become smoother... Especially after a meal, we should not jump around vigorously, nor should we bury ourselves in our studies. If we casually invite three or four close friends and take a slow stroll together, the resulting benefits are truly beyond description in words.</p>
<p>Many people do not know the importance and pleasure of walking. As soon as they step out of the door, it seems that they cannot walk without a car. They make excuses such as the distance is too far, the weather is too hot, or their health is not good... and so on, as reasons for taking a car instead of walking. But in reality, we must know that walking is absolutely beneficial to both body and mind. Sometimes, even if the sun is blazing and it is exceptionally hot, or the distance is indeed too far, then taking a car for a short distance is certainly not out of the question. But for example, when you come out early in the morning, when the weather is not very hot and the air is very fresh, then even if the distance is a bit longer, as long as you leave a little earlier, you can very well walk to your place of work.</p>
<h3>Effective Remedy for Mosquito Bites</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>In the hot autumn, we still like to bare our legs, but annoying mosquitoes come specifically to attack us. It would be fine if they only bit us a few times; but they itch so much. If we are not careful and scratch the skin, it will inevitably become ulcerated, leaving many scars on our legs. Wearing short socks only makes it look worse. Now I am introducing a very cheap medicine that can immediately relieve itching when applied to the wound, so that our fair legs will never have unsightly scars!</p>
<p>The so-called effective medicine is a very stinky substance called ammonia, a pale yellow aqueous solution, commonly known as ammonia water. Although it stinks, it has a more significant effect than cologne. We can inject a few drops of ammonia into the cologne we buy, which can not only avoid the pungent odor but also increase the effectiveness of the cologne. The reason why Lin Wenyan's cologne sold on the market is more effective than other brands is because it contains a small amount of ammonia. However, cologne containing ammonia always has some odor, which cannot be eliminated without letting it sit for two or three years. Therefore, domestic cologne manufacturers are unwilling to add ammonia because they are afraid of the interest they would lose from having to let the products sit for two or three years. Our purpose is to stop the itching, so a little odor is not a big deal. Fortunately, it will evaporate as soon as it is applied to the legs, and it will definitely not make fragrant legs stink!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on Clothing, Food, and Housing</h3>
<p>— (Fenfen)</p>
<p>Fried dough sticks and sesame cakes are the most common foods, but now their price has doubled. From now on, "three coppers for fried dough sticks and sesame cakes" has become a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Although it is already autumn, the weather is even more sultry and hot than before, with little rainfall, which is unpleasant. Burning mugwort and calamus in the room can slightly dispel the dampness.</p>
<p>Some people say that in the future, living in the "Isolated Island" will become "tea room-like," separated by wooden boards, with the pedestrian walkway in the middle serving as a "public dining hall."</p>
<p>There are also good options for commoners to beat the summer heat, such as iced mung bean soup and sour plum soup.</p>
<p>Fewer people are wearing sunglasses this year. I don't know why.</p>
<p>The swimwear business has declined sharply because it is too aristocratic. If you visit the swimming pool, you will see that most men are shirtless, wearing only black shorts.</p>

<h3>One Week's Economical Menu</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huaying</p>
<p>Among meats, pork is the most versatile, just like licorice in medicinal herbs, it is indispensable everywhere. The methods of cutting meat are also diverse, whether it is cut into chunks, slices, shreds, or diced, or chopped finely into mince, or just using meat bones. The complexity of the cooking methods can be imagined. Among them, chopping finely into mince is a method with many variations and is relatively economical. After chopping the meat finely, mix it with soy sauce. The most common method is stuffing, such as stuffing meat into fried tofu or gluten. These two methods are suitable for soups; dry frying is not very suitable. In addition, there is also stuffing meat into old cucumbers. Peel the thick, large old cucumbers, cut them into sections, remove the seeds, and then stuff the meat mince inside. Then add fragrant mushrooms, daylily tips, and other ingredients, and braise them together in soy sauce. The flavor is quite good. Eggplants and tomatoes can also be prepared in the same way. When braising eggplants stuffed with meat, it is best to add some sweet sauce to make them more delicious. There are many tomatoes on the market lately, and they are not expensive. Smaller ones can be bought for seven or eight per dime. This item is extremely rich in vitamins. Using it to stuff meat and braise in soy sauce has a unique flavor. It can also be eaten after meals as a substitute for fruit. Just peel off the skin and dip it in some white sugar to reduce the sourness. Because it has a lot of water, it is no less appealing than honey peaches. Recently, because fruit prices are expensive, the writer often uses tomatoes as a substitute. Why don't everyone try it too?</p>

<h3>Photos of Rooftop Houses</h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>
<p>What are "rooftop houses"? They are houses built using rooftops. There is a saying that goes, "Borrow heaven, not land." Using rooftops can be considered "borrowing heaven." This type of rooftop house existed before, but there are even more of them now. The population of the Isolated Island has surged, and the housing problem is difficult to solve. People have to rack their brains. This is certainly due to the landlords' heavy profit-seeking mentality, but it is also a way to remedy the housing shortage, so it does not seem too blameworthy.</p>
<p>The construction of ordinary "rooftop houses" can be divided into two types: one is carefully built, "magnificent and beautiful," and the other is simply built to provide shelter from the wind and rain. The former, although without steel and cement, is also brick-built and plastered, with columns and beams. Inside the room, you wouldn't know that you are in a "building outside a building." This type of "rooftop house" has a breadth and length similar to a small attic room, but with windows on three sides, there is ample light and air circulation. In the summer, there is a cool breeze, and in the winter, there is sunshine. It is warm in winter and cool in summer, and the attic room will sigh in comparison. Moreover, the "building outside a building" stands alone, isolated from the good wife in the front building, the aunt in the back building, and the sister-in-law in the attic room... saving a lot of trouble and avoiding minor conflicts that may arise from trivial matters, like transcending the world, it is incomparably peaceful.</p>
<p>As for rent, in this area of "every inch of land is gold," such a rooftop house is not necessarily cheap. About twenty dollars a month is considered a fair rent by the landlord. For people with small families who love peace and quiet, this type of rooftop house is very suitable. However, families with children cannot live there, otherwise, if they are not careful, they might roll a "topsy-turvy" on the narrow ladder, which is not a joke, and the safety of their little lives would be at risk. Living in a "rooftop house" also has an advantage: when you hear about a "fire" somewhere, other people have to run out to watch the excitement, but here, you only need to look out the window to have a clear view. However, if misfortune strikes and the trouble occurs in your own doorway, then the danger to the residents of this "rooftop house" is greater than in any other place. There are advantages and disadvantages, and nothing is absolute in the world.</p>
<p>Therefore, building houses using rooftops cannot be done casually. It must be approved by the police authorities. Otherwise, even if the new house is completed, it will be ordered to be demolished for public safety. However, some alley houses that are simply built "rooftop houses" are still everywhere. Old wooden boards serve as walls, rusted lead sheets as the roof, there is a cooking stove but no chimney, and a hole is punched in the wooden board as a window. Smoke comes out of the window, and the roof leaks on rainy days. Often there is heavy rain outside and light rain inside. The rent for such a "rooftop house" like a sampan is naturally much cheaper. Its residents are nothing more than rickshaw pullers, road workers, dock coolies... these laborers and small peddlers who carry their goods on their shoulders. These days, "housing" in Shanghai is indeed difficult. In a small building, you can feel the "variety."</p>

<p>Economic Supplement</p>
<h3>The Issue of Stopping Payment of Exchange Checks (i.e., Allocation Orders)</h3>
<p>— Mu Shens</p>
<p>Our country used negotiable instruments earlier than other countries, but the names are often inconsistent, and the processing procedures are also divergent. This is because our country did not have a negotiable instruments law in the past to follow. However, it has always attached great importance to credit and has not diminished in its brilliance because of this, and there are many good achievements to be mentioned. Consider the "zhuang piao" of Shanghai in the past, which were issued by the remittance zhuang (i.e., money shops that were members of the Money Trade Association). Their credit was as good as cash, and Chinese and foreign merchants were happy to accept them. This was because the holder of a zhuang piao enjoyed the highest priority. If the issuing money shop went bankrupt, the Money Trade Association would immediately collect funds to fully redeem the zhuang piao that were circulating, regardless of whether they were due or not, never causing the holder to suffer any loss. It was once praised that zhuang piao were "golden butterflies," which shows how deeply they were welcomed.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the Republic of China, banks have flourished, all issuing "banker's drafts" to circulate in the market, but they are not as popular as zhuang piao. In the past, foreign banks only accepted zhuang piao for shipments of imported goods, which is clear evidence of this. The reason for this is twofold: money shops are partnership organizations and bear unlimited liability, while banks are limited liability organizations. This is a difference in organization. The holder of a zhuang piao enjoys the highest priority, while bank drafts are generally regarded as ordinary claims. This is a difference in claims. Later, when a certain money shop was being liquidated, the Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that the holder of a zhuang piao enjoyed the highest priority, believed that this would easily lead to the abuse of zhuang partners issuing zhuang piao in advance for related deposits, which was unfair to all creditors. Therefore, it resolutely banned it, and the zhuang piao were included in the processing of ordinary debts. After that, bank drafts were used as commonly as zhuang piao and were no longer discriminated against.</p>
<p>In the current Shanghai market, zhuang piao and bank drafts are rarely seen. What circulates are mostly "exchange checks," which are the incarnation of the "allocation orders" of the past. Because they are checks issued by "exchange banks," they are called "exchange checks." According to the issuance of "exchange checks," money shops generally issue them through the "money vault," while banks issue them individually through the member banks, all of which are transferred to the "check clearing house." This is a good phenomenon of further cooperation between the silver and money industries—centralized exchange. The issuance method of "exchange checks" can be divided into two types: one is for depositors withdrawing deposits or holding a depositor's check requesting to exchange for a banker's draft, which can be regarded as a "banker's draft" or "zhuang piao"; the second is for holding a check or banker's draft requesting redemption, which should be regarded as a "transfer order." The issuance of "exchange checks" is nothing more than the above two ways. Therefore, the essence of "exchange checks" is either a "banker's draft" as a "credit instrument" or a "transfer order" as a "payment tool." There is no doubt about this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the reason why "exchange checks" are called "checks" instead of "banker's drafts" or "transfer orders" is that "banker's drafts" and "transfer orders" are required to affix stamps according to regulations, and in this extraordinary period, they must be doubled. Today, calling them "checks" can obtain the preferential treatment of exemption from stamps. Therefore, the identity of an "exchange check" is actually no different from a "banker's draft" or a "transfer order," but it is called a "check" for the sake of saving stamps. Those who receive "exchange checks" only need to recognize that the check is not forged and pay attention to the reputation of the issuing bank (that is, the bank is unlikely to go bankrupt in the shortest period of time) to obtain sound protection and will never encounter a dishonored check. At present, "exchange checks" have been widely circulated, transferred and accepted, and have won the welcome and trust of society, no different from the zhuang piao of the past. There is good reason for this.</p>
<p>However, the fact is contrary to the theory. There have been many disputes arising from the rash stopping of payment of "exchange checks." If these unwarranted disputes are not resolved reasonably as soon as possible, the impact on the credit of bank negotiable instruments will be huge and will not be a blessing for the future of finance. It is worthwhile to study this. However, before the study, the author must first state his position: first, there is absolutely no malicious attack on any bank or shop; second, there is no one-sided defense on behalf of others. Only with the aim of throwing a brick to attract jade will I make a legal discussion, and I hope that the wise men of the financial community will further educate me.</p>
<p>The issuance method and essence of "exchange checks" have been seen above. Therefore, since "exchange checks" are issued by banks, whether they are "payment tools" or "credit instruments," the issuer bears the liability for negotiable instruments, and it is appropriate to regard them as "bank drafts." Once the identity of "exchange checks" is determined, its degree of credit is not difficult to estimate. According to past customs, bank drafts and money shop zhuang piao only need not be forged, and the issuing bank or shop does not need to go bankrupt, then the bank drafts and zhuang piao should have a full redemption guarantee. Except for the holder's application for loss and stop payment due to theft or fraud, it has not been heard that the issuing bank or shop rashly stopped payment and returned the check. Perhaps bank drafts and zhuang piao are "promissory" negotiable instruments, while the current "exchange checks" are "entrusted" negotiable instruments. However, the issuance and commitment to redeem are inherently the same. From a legal point of view, "exchange checks" should be regarded as checks in accordance with the law because they are printed with the word "check." However, checks are "payment securities," so they focus on capital relations and are limited to sight payments (see Article 124 of the Negotiable Instruments Law). Today, in order to meet social needs, banks issue "forward exchange checks" as "credit instruments" with the nature of credit securities and regard them as "bank drafts," which is also appropriate. Regardless of whether they are "checks" or "bank drafts," the issuing bank promises to issue them first and should be responsible for redeeming them later. Because once a negotiable instrument is issued, the issuer is in the position of the principal debtor and should bear the unconditional responsibility for payment. It goes without saying that the holder obtains it directly from the issuing bank. Even if it comes from transfer and acceptance, as long as it is legally obtained, it is a "bona fide holder," and its right to use negotiable instruments is protected by law. Returning to the discussion, even if we recognize "exchange checks" as ordinary checks, according to the principle that negotiable instruments are "abstract securities," Article 10 of the Negotiable Instruments Law stipulates: "The debtor of a negotiable instrument may not use the reasons for protest between himself and the issuer or the previous holder to confront the holder..." Furthermore, according to Article 6 of the Negotiable Instruments Law, "The debtor of a negotiable instrument shall bear the burden of proof when the holder is found to have fraudulent malice or gross negligence." As such, the issuing bank of "exchange checks" must not arbitrarily stop payment, whether in terms of reason or law. This is very clear.</p>
<p>Perhaps our country originally had two procedures, "acceptance" and "certification," which are necessary for "exchange checks." If they are not performed, the holder is to blame. However, the "acceptance" procedure is a right enjoyed by the holder and is by no means an obligation that it must fulfill. The holder only needs to be able to identify that it is a genuine check and does not need to accept it. As for whether there are any entanglements in the negotiable instrument, as long as the holder obtains it legally, it is a "bona fide holder" and is protected by law (see Article 10 of the Negotiable Instruments Law). The "certification" procedure is also not necessary. As long as you trust that the issuing bank will not issue "bad checks" and will not stop payment without reason, there is no need to request "certification," which is a waste of procedure. Therefore, the above two points are not enough to remove the responsibility for the arbitrary stopping of payment and returning of "exchange checks." Furthermore, at present, remittance discounts are prevalent, and the discount rate is extremely high, forming today's serious problem. It is believed that those who engage in remittance discounts are not formal banks or money shops, but are newly established silver shops or money exchange shops with weak credit and limited capital. Those who can engage in such a large discount transaction generally beg for the accommodation of negotiable instruments from a small number of banks or money shops. Otherwise, without negotiable instrument financing and mediation, it is difficult to complete the transaction because there is no way to gain the trust of others. On the bank and money shop side, the financing of negotiable instruments is generally done with "exchange checks," and it is considered that "overdrafting the face value" is not important. If the borrower is unfaithful, it can be stopped for payment as a last resort, because the loan is a "check." This naive idea is not worth the laughter of knowledgeable people. There was once an "exchange check" obtained through discounting, which was brought to the issuing bank to request acceptance. The bank refused acceptance on the pretext of an immediate check, leaving room for stopping payment and returning the check, which proves the erroneous prejudice. It is because they hold this erroneous view that they do not pay attention to the financing of negotiable instruments. If the borrower encounters theft or fraud and is unable to compensate, the bank also believes that as long as it stops payment and returns the check, it can pass the blame on to the final holder. Their views are so absurd! Therefore, I once said that a small number of banks in the country mistakenly believe that the arbitrary stopping of payment of "exchange checks" is reasonable, which is enough to cause today's high discount rates.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe that "exchange checks" are widely circulated today and are the center of current negotiable instruments. On the social side, they are uniformly accepted and regarded as bank drafts or money shop zhuang piao, but on the bank side, a small number of banks hold erroneous views and lose their credit. It is necessary to correct this. Otherwise, who would dare to accept bank negotiable instruments? In the future, the effectiveness of negotiable instruments and the reputation of banks will be unimaginable. If it can be quickly eliminated in the invisible before society pays attention to it, and the credit of bank negotiable instruments is established, then the wind of empty loan negotiable instruments can be stopped, and the serious problem of high discount rates can also be solved accordingly. Its benefits are not only maintaining the credit of "exchange checks."</p>
<p>In summary, the author believes that the bank has signed the "exchange check", which has been in the position of the debtor of the negotiable instrument, and the redemption of the negotiable instrument is its due obligation. Except for the ability to prove that the holder is not a bona fide acquirer, there is no way to change its redemption responsibility. Under the principle of tightening legal tender and promoting negotiable instruments, this industry has become the "exchange check" payment issue that is the center of circulating negotiable instruments. It is honestly one that does not tolerate a silent people. (28/8/18)</p>
<h3>The Future of American Gold Policy</h3>
<p>— Zou Sicong</p>
<p>Since various countries around the world have successively managed their currencies, many economists believe that the future of gold will also follow the path of decline, similar to silver. However, the US government purchased gold worth $1,110 million in 1936, $1,586 million in 1937, and $1,974 million in 1938. According to a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of the United States, as of July 26 of this year, the US Treasury's gold reserves, calculated at $35 per ounce, had reached $16,227 million, accounting for over 64% of the world's total gold reserves, an increase of $3,225 million compared to the same period last year. In a letter from US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau to Senator Wagner (the original letter reprinted in *The Banker*, June 1939), he mentioned the allocation of Treasury gold reserves. It is stated that the majority of the Treasury's gold reserves are used as backing for the Federal Reserve Banks' issuance of gold certificates, according to the Gold Reserve Act. If, due to the necessity of clearing international balance of payments or maintaining the purchasing power of various US currencies, the Secretary of the Treasury approves, gold certificates can be exempted from being backed by gold bullion.</p>
<p>Gold has two monetary uses: first, as a reserve for currency issuance, and second, for clearing international balance of payments deficits. The US Treasury possesses $16,227 million in gold, and with such narrow uses, it is bound to become bloated. US law stipulates that Federal Reserve notes must have 40% gold certificates as reserves, and Federal Reserve Banks' deposits must have 35% gold certificates or legal currency as reserves. The purpose of the legal reserve is to prevent excessive expansion of the amount of banknotes in circulation and bank credit; however, the current holdings of gold and gold certificates far exceed the legally required reserves. As for using it for clearing international balance of payments deficits, there does not seem to be a more satisfactory alternative to gold at present. Many countries, due to a lack of gold, have to rack their brains and severely manage foreign exchange, control import and export trade, or adopt clearing agreements and barter agreements to try to solve the difficulties of balancing international payments. However, in the case of the United States, which has had a smooth international balance of payments in recent years, there is no need to adopt these methods, even without gold reserves. Therefore, the accumulation of gold in the United States has other reasons.</p>
<p>The main reasons for the massive influx of gold into the United States in the past five years are: huge inflows of overseas capital, favorable balance of both tangible and intangible trade, and the US government providing an unlimited gold market at a fixed dollar price. The process of gold flowing to the United States is as follows: capital inflows and a favorable balance of lending strengthen the value of the dollar against foreign currencies. Subsequently, foreign or American banks and merchants, seeing the potential for profit, transport gold to the United States and sell it to the US Treasury at a price of $35 per ounce, then sell the dollars obtained in the foreign exchange market, and the value of the dollar against foreign currencies falls. Through this structure, gold from all over the world flows continuously to the US Treasury.</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the massive transfer of foreign capital to the United States, the main reason is that war clouds are gathering in Europe and Asia, and flames of war are spreading. All funds regard the United States as a safe haven. This is one reason. The reason why some speculators transfer capital to the United States is that they predict that the exchange rate of their own currency against the dollar will fall, hoping to profit from exchange rate fluctuations. This is another reason. The United States' foreign trade has increased rapidly in recent years, and foreign banks and merchants have had to increase their working capital deposited in US banks. This is the third reason. American investments abroad are being withdrawn to the home country due to unfavorable political and economic conditions abroad. This is the fourth reason.</p>
<p>Since large amounts of gold have flowed into the United States, the US government cannot allow it to float freely on the market and stir up the market. Therefore, although there is a lot of gold stored in the Treasury, it is still necessary to continue purchasing it. Many people who do not understand the US government's painstaking efforts criticize the US government's gold policy, believing that gold is already repeating the history of silver, and the US government is exchanging the people's hard-earned products for useless gold, which is a foolish act. Some say that hoarding gold is a gambling act; others say that gold has become a great disaster for the United States.</p>
<p>In fact, the reason why the US government cannot stop buying gold is very simple, because if it stops buying gold, the general US economy will be seriously affected, the foreign exchange market and the gold market will experience great turmoil, international trade figures will be greatly reduced, and the promotion of all US recovery plans will be hindered. The exchange rate balance of several major currencies, such as the British pound, US dollar, and French franc, which has been maintained through years of painstaking efforts, will immediately collapse. This is even more expected. Therefore, some people advocate that the US government should prohibit the continued import of gold. However, this will cause the world gold price to plummet, leading to the elimination of the function of clearing international balance of payments; and the economies of gold-producing areas and gold-producing countries will also suffer extremely profound blows, which will affect the United States itself. Others advocate devaluing the gold price from $35 per ounce to $25, but the result would also be enough to affect the international exchange rate of the dollar, and the US government naturally would not dare to make a decision. Therefore, the US gold policy has continued to the present under a contradictory mentality.</p>
<p>Now that the outbreak of war in Europe is imminent, more gold is flowing to the United States from various places. The British government officially notified the United States the day before yesterday that it would stop maintaining the exchange rate of the pound. This may give the United States a suitable opportunity to reconsider the international gold price and exchange rate balance. Otherwise, the US economic boom in recent years will lose its continuation due to the expensive dollar. Even for political reasons, the United States also needs to revise the world gold price and international exchange rate balance, just like during the European war, the United States maintained the British pound to assist the Allied countries. It can be asserted that Shanghai speculators, who are still buying gold and foreign exchange, will sooner or later become victims of American economic security and political morality.</p>
<h3>The Future of the Japanese Economy (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ms. Feng Meiqi</p>
<p>The United States' position in Japan's foreign trade is more important than that of the United Kingdom, especially in terms of military supplies. In 1938, Japan's imports from the United States were worth 915 million yen, or half of its imports from outside the yen bloc. Japan's exports to the United States were 425 million yen. Most of Japan's import deficit with non-yen bloc countries, about 490 million yen, was with the United States. Most of these were imports of military raw materials. In detail, in 1937, 54.4% of Japan's military raw material imports came from the United States, 17.5% from the United Kingdom, and 7.4% from the Dutch East Indies. More came from the United States in 1938. Since Japan began restricting imports of non-essential goods, imports from the United Kingdom have fallen by half, from 1,110 million yen in 1937 to 550 million yen in 1938; on the other hand, imports from the United States have fallen by only a quarter, from 1,269 million yen to 915 million yen. In other words, the ratio of exports from the United States to Japan to those from the United Kingdom was 12.7 to 11 in 1937, but 9.1 to 5.5 in 1938.</p>
<p>Table (7) shows the statistics of US exports to Japan from 1937 to 1938. This shows the importance of the US market for Japan's exports. With the exception of a few items such as rubber, this table includes all of the military raw materials that Japan needs to purchase from abroad. At least four items, namely premium gasoline, automobiles, machinery, and scrap metal, cannot but be purchased from the US market. The total amount of military raw materials purchased by Japan and its percentage of imports is quite large. Of the $528 million in US exports to Japan from 1937 to 1938, $326 million—or 61.2%—were military raw materials. In 1938, due to a slight drop in prices, the quantity of these goods may have been even greater. Therefore, the drop in its value was small, while the increase in its percentage was large. The percentage of military raw materials in 1937 was 58.8%, while in 1938 it increased to 66.3%. In that year, Japan's imports of non-essential goods from the United States decreased by about half, while imports of raw cotton decreased by 15%. Raw cotton is not listed as a military raw material import in this table, although raw cotton is important to the Japanese textile industry, and a portion is also used for the manufacture of munitions. From 1937 to 1938, sales of American kerosene and kerosene products to Japan were equal to raw cotton. Finished munitions are not listed in the table. In recent years, the number of American goods sold to "Manchukuo" has also been quite large, and the percentage of military raw materials among them is even higher. Of the $30 million in US exports to "Manchukuo" in 1937 and 1938, at least $25 million, or 75.7%, were military supplies. Therefore, the total amount of military raw materials sold by the United States to Japan and "Manchukuo" from 1937 to 1938 reached over $350 million, not including indirect sales through Chinese ports.</p>
<p>Table (7) Analysis of US Exports to Japan (Thousands of US Dollars)</p>
<p>These figures show the importance of the US market to Japan's war effort in the past two years. If a war breaks out, Japan's need for this market will be even greater, but if the United Kingdom, France, and the Netherlands become hostile to Japan, their trade will automatically be cut off. Trade between the United States and Japan will also be severely restricted, and Japan will no longer be able to purchase its military raw materials from the United States.</p>
<p>From the contraction of the Japanese domestic economy, the decline of export trade, and the gradual depletion of gold reserves, we can see that its economic crisis is approaching day by day, so we can confidently assert that its collapse is imminent. From recent experience, we know that a modern economic society can extend its life for a considerable period without collapsing immediately. However, as the situation expands, Japan will undoubtedly be unable to maintain it for a certain period of time. Moreover, the Sino-Japanese war for the past two years has exhausted its strength.</p>
<p>(The following is a discussion of the impact of Anglo-Soviet negotiations on the Japanese economy, which is not very relevant to the current international situation, so it is omitted – Editor)</p>
<h3>New Posture of Industrial Construction in the Southwest (Continued from Issue 279)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Erjia</p>
<p>In the past, among the financial institutions in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces, Sichuan Province was relatively complete. The rest were backward. In Guizhou Province, in the years before 1935, modern new-style banking organizations ceased to exist after the Bank of China was forced to close by warlords and the Guizhou Bank collapsed due to excessive issuance of paper money. From 1935 to 1937, the entire province only had branches of the Central Bank and the Agricultural Bank of China in Guiyang, the provincial capital. Now, modern new-style banks have been established in relatively prosperous counties in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces.</p>
<p>Financial institutions organized by the government are new products of the War of Resistance. At present, in addition to the central government's agencies, each province generally has adjustment agencies for agriculture, commerce, industry, and mining. Therefore, official financial institutions are also one of the fund-raising industries for completing the work of resisting and building.</p>
<p>The current content of the financial industry in Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces is as follows:</p>
<p>Category Sichuan Province Guizhou Province Yunnan Province Total</p>
<p>Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces are vast and rich in resources. The content of the various factories for recent industrial construction includes new enterprises with huge capital, such as several yarn factories and chemical industries, with the largest capital reaching 6 million yuan. However, the majority of industries still lack strong financial resources. In terms of the number of factories, it is still far from becoming an emerging industrial center.</p>
<p>Inland industries receive various rewards and preferential treatment from the government, but national industries located in the Shanghai concessions are not only subjected to various forms of exploitation, but also face the danger of being cut off from the supply of raw materials and the outlet of products at any time. The difference between the two is like heaven and earth. However, although the industrial circles in Shanghai have the idea of ​​seeking shelter under trees, the reason why they are hesitant to move forward is nothing more than the lack of security in the interior and the difficulty of transporting factories. And the high-priced market in Shanghai, which is caused by foreign exchange black market speculation, is the main element of nostalgia. Now, because the Ministry of Finance is trying to eliminate the rise of the foreign exchange black market and has taken measures to restrict withdrawals, there is already a threat of freezing industrial funds. At the same time, the Japanese blockade and control of transportation lines and the strengthening of raw material collection and exclusive estimation, and the dumping of surplus commodities have surrounded Shanghai industry on all sides. And today, inland transportation is no longer a problem due to the efforts of the authorities to improve it. If the government can slightly support the guarantee of inland security with the means of state-owned insurance, then the national industries in the Shanghai concessions will re-weigh the means of survival and consider it.</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: Britain is Throwing Out Gold; Pure Gold Appears at an Unprecedented Peak of £7 15s.</h3>
<p>London, 26th - The buying of British pure gold is more intense than the buying frenzy that occurred in December of last year when Germany rampantly persecuted Jews. The lack of maintenance has caused it to soar to an astonishing sum of four shillings and sixpence (fifty-four pence) per ounce, reaching an unprecedented peak of £7 15s. It is said that the increasingly tense European situation has caused people to fear, and they are throwing out British gold pounds and buying pure gold.</p>
<h3>Cash on the Black Market Soars: Raised to $4,180 Outside the Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday's cash grey market situation, due to the value of the weekly holiday, did not have a formal market price, but the trend outside the market was quite good. It is believed that under the various attempts of US President Roosevelt to maintain peace in Europe, there is hope for a peaceful resolution. In addition, it was heard that British pure gold has soared by four shillings and sixpence, which has excited the depressed people due to the fear of the European war. The buying interest is extremely strong. For example, a certain money exchange company has the best stomach, and it is said that it is on behalf of the local gang. However, although the silverware gang and various cash shops have door-to-door purchases, they are unwilling to sell easily under good news, which has caused the price to rise sharply. From 4,120 yuan in the early morning, it skyrocketed to 4,180 yuan. There were a few transactions in the middle, and even at noon, it was difficult to obtain the above final price, which was more than 150 yuan higher than the closing price on the previous day. However, because it is not an official market price, the silver and jewelry gold per tael is exchanged for (because the wages can be increased) 410 yuan at Datong Hang and 408 yuan at Xin Tonghang, and the proceeds are reduced by a dozen yuan.</p>
<h3>Large Silver Bars are Close to Small Silver Pieces</h3>
<p>London, 26th - The large silver bar market has not changed recently. The forward price has shrunk by 1.25. India has sold, speculators have bought, the supply is limited, and the market situation is stagnant. Bombay Telegraph: Indian silver spot has shrunk by 3 annas, September has shrunk by 2 annas, and October has shrunk by 1 anna. There is no transaction, and the market situation is calm. As for the price of American silver spot and the exchange rate of the United States to foreign exchange, there is no telegram due to the hot weather on Saturday.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Fractional Currency is Becoming Serious Again</h3>
<p>Since the disappearance of copper coin auxiliary coins in this city, this newspaper has advocated that the central bank, which is responsible for regulating finance, should issue fractional currency notes as soon as possible to provide relief. Months have passed in a blink of an eye, and the fractional currency notes were originally scheduled to be issued on the 22nd of this month, but due to procedures and other issues, they have been postponed indefinitely. When copper coin auxiliary coins are lacking, merchants have printed substitute coupons, but they are only applicable to one company and cannot be widely circulated. Instead, they are replaced by stamps, which are widely circulated. Recently, since the post office declared that it would refuse to redeem them at the original price, they have been sold at a discount. Therefore, various industries refuse to use them, and streetcar coupons are used for other purposes. In recent days, there has been a shortage of streetcar coupons, and those who take the bus are often told to get off because they do not have coupons and the ticket sellers cannot find coupons. Disputes often arise. Since the refusal to use stamps, the number of substitute coupons on the market has doubled, with various colors. It is estimated that there are hundreds of kinds. In the past, substitute coupons were mostly issued by large companies and streetcar companies. Now, restaurants, amusement venues, taverns, bathrooms, and even small cigarette paper shops are printing substitute coupons. The paper is rough, the printing is poor, and it becomes muddy after one use. If no measures are taken to ban it and allow it to rot, it will have a huge impact on the livelihood of the common people in the future. For the sake of unifying the currency system and reducing disputes, it is hoped that the central bank will issue fractional currency notes as soon as possible to facilitate circulation and facilitate the turnover of various industries.

<h3>Coal: Haiphong Coal is Loaded in Shanghai; There is No Fear of Fuel Shortage in this City</h3>
<p>The firewood and charcoal market was closed in Oujiang a month ago, and the source was cut off. The city's inventory is decreasing day by day, which has led to hoarding by speculators and monopoly by unscrupulous merchants. The black market has skyrocketed, which is unimaginable. Wenzhou Grade A charcoal has risen from 2.85 yuan per load to 8 yuan, and there is still no large supply. Huxijiang charcoal has shouted 4.8 yuan, and the market price has more than doubled. It is heard that a certain company brought 60 tons of Haiphong bagged charcoal from the French Concession yesterday and shipped it to Shanghai for trial sales. It has been loaded on a certain ship together with Hongji coal. If the sales are suitable, goods will come from the source, which will open a new source for charcoal, and there will be no fear of fuel shortage in this city.</p>
<h3>Hardware: Pig Iron and Copper are Sold Out</h3>
<p>The spot goods of pig iron and copper currently circulating on the market are very scarce. Due to certain relationships, they are almost sold out. It is heard that those who have a slight inventory are also unwilling to throw them out. According to reliable sources, it is because a certain party is absorbing them in large quantities. Apart from this, another way to sell is not worth mentioning, so the standard is also very chaotic. However, it is dozens of yuan better than before. At the moment, the spot price of India's top pig iron is 340 yuan per ton, No. 2 is 330 yuan, Russia's top is 330 yuan, Yangzi's top is 320 yuan, and No. 2 is 310 yuan. In terms of copper, T·C purple copper ingots are sold for 200 yuan per load, brass strips are sold for 180 yuan, brass skin is sold for 180 yuan, purple copper skin is 210 yuan, and purple copper wire is 210 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Foreign Sugar Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to be tight and continued to rise. The guild's price for 24 coarse white spot goods was 44 yuan per stack, up 1.7 yuan, and 43.5 yuan per foreign stack, up 1.5 yuan. Transit goods were still 34 yuan. Taikoo car white rose 1.45 yuan, B mark was 47.5 yuan, CW mark 47 yuan, CX mark 46.8 yuan, DY mark 46.5 yuan, HX mark 46.3 yuan, H mark car red rose half a yuan, 30.5 yuan, Dutch red rose 1 yuan, spot goods have reached 40 yuan, transit 33.5 yuan, the local cotton white rose 2 yuan, Zhenji No. 1 44 yuan, No. 2 43.5 yuan, No. 3 43 yuan, No. 4 42.5 yuan. The national sugar is still rising tightly, and it is heard that the price of the trade has increased, and the market will definitely follow the high.</p>
<h3>The Current Difficulties of the Shanghai Raw Silk Industry (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yang</p>
<p>Regarding the export of finished products, in the near future, it may also be possible to hand over a certain machine to the point of absolute management. This is also the best measure to monopolize the export of Shanghai raw silk and exclude the interests of third countries. The signboard of "Commodity Export Inspection" is used to inspect the quality of raw silk and issue "Export Certificates" to perform the task of the Commodity Bureau of the Ministry of Industry before the war, to "control" the export of Shanghai raw silk, and at the same time, it can seize all foreign exchange from the export of raw silk, making the production, manufacturing, and sales of the entire raw silk industry completely become its appendage.</p>
<p>This is the current crisis of the Shanghai silk industry. However, are we just waiting to die?</p>
<p>(3) Struggle leads to survival, compromise leads to death, and the third way is the end of destruction, only destroying our bright future.</p>
<p>How can the silk industry survive?</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the number of people engaged in the silk industry, from factory owners to employees, from brokers to export firms, is no less than 12,000! From the previous few times that people have oppressed the silk industry, from the situation of compromising on one side and inching forward, it seems that strong organized self-defense is possible to stop the other party's steps of attack. However, this requires silk factories, silk stacks, and export firms, regardless of Chinese or foreign merchants, to carry out a collective action, ignoring everything and ignoring everything. The movement is expanded and sustained, so that his attempt to control it becomes ineffective in a stagnant situation, and further promotes the attention of the world. This is still the negative side.</p>
<p>The positive side is to move silk factories inland, and for large-scale factories, to break them up into smaller units, so as not to be caught in one net. Everyone knows that the effectiveness of small silk factories in the suburbs of Wuxi is the best economic guerrilla force against control. In the Shanghai silk industry, due to the unresolved problem of cocoon transportation, and turning to opening small factories in the interior, and the grasp of this kind of operation is profitable, it is enough to prove that under the current conditions, large silk factories must adapt to the environment and change their form to continue to survive and accumulate future development power. The method of breaking them up into smaller units and returning to the guerrilla area is no longer empty talk, but a fact.</p>
<p>Not to Take Export as the Ultimate Goal</p>
<p>It is said that the cotton in North China, in addition to using it as much as possible, is burned to ashes for the sake of anti-control. This is the best way to combat "fighting a war with war." When our silk industry is to be controlled, breaking up silk factories into smaller units, reducing the production of raw silk, and never allowing a silk thread to be used is also the best coping strategy. Apart from this, there is no third way for us to choose. If there is, it is to cover up our own surrender, run to the end of destruction, and destroy our bright and brilliant future! — August 6th, sent from Wuxi — (End)</p>

<h3>Taikoo and Jardine Increase the Price of Nanhua Passenger Tickets</h3>
<p>Since Taikoo and Jardine revised their passenger ticket prices on June 22 this year, the prices of large dining room tickets are denominated in Hong Kong dollars, and the prices of various classes of official room and steerage tickets are denominated in national currency. Recently, because the companies have seen that foreign exchange has shrunk sharply and expenses have increased, they have decided to increase the prices of official room and steerage passenger tickets from Shanghai to various ports in South China by more than 10% from September 1, and still denominate them in national currency. The prices of large dining room tickets will still be the same as the prices revised by the two companies on June 22, and this decision has not been increased. The newly revised ticket prices of the two companies from Shanghai to Hong Kong and Haiphong are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Shanghai to Hong Kong: Official cabin, National Currency 65 yuan, Room cabin 50 yuan, Hanging bunk 40 yuan, Steerage 26 yuan.</p>
<p>Shanghai to Haiphong: Official cabin, National Currency 120 yuan, Room cabin 88 yuan, Hanging bunk 58 yuan, Steerage 47 yuan.</p>
<p>Haiphong landing tax: still 4 yuan for official cabin, 2 yuan for room cabin, and 1 yuan for hanging bunk and steerage.</p>
<p>According to the price increase method of the companies on August 22, those who have prepaid a fixed amount or have purchased tickets before the price increase date can still enjoy the old price. In order to unify the ticket prices, the two companies have decided that for ships sailing south from Shanghai on or after September 1, the ticket prices must be purchased according to the newly revised prices, regardless of whether a fixed amount has been paid or a ticket has been purchased. Regarding the price of the northern route tickets of the two companies, they will still be sold according to the prices set on June 22, and there will be no price increase this time.</p>
<h3>Guide for Students Abroad in America</h3>
<p>— Inquiry</p>
<p>Clothing, Food, Housing, and Transportation</p>
<p>Clothing: Preparations for clothing have already been discussed in this publication's "Procedures for Studying in America," so there is no need to repeat them. Now, I will just briefly discuss clothing in general. Young women usually wear Chinese clothes, so there is nothing special to pay attention to. Male students in America generally dress casually, but sometimes one cannot be too careless. In general, people in large cities dress more neatly than those in small cities, and people in the East dress more elegantly than those in the West. There are also significant differences between graduate students and undergraduate students, and liberal arts students dress better than science and engineering students. Of course, this is only a general observation, and there are always exceptions. In terms of occasions, banquets and dances are the most formal, but formal wear is rarely needed. When meeting guests (especially women) and attending tea parties, one should also dress neatly. Larger dining halls and decent restaurants also require neat attire, unless it is extremely hot summer. Students attending classes in large cities mostly dress neatly, while in small cities, vests and short jackets are sometimes worn, and ties are not always worn. In Western universities, not wearing a tie is almost a custom, and in the summer, most wear only shirts and trousers, occasionally with a tie. In small restaurants near the school, most people are very casual. Americans usually wear matching colors for their tops and bottoms. Although it is also acceptable to wear different colors for the top and trousers, few people dress like this in formal settings.</p>
<p>Chinese students going to America for advanced studies should naturally follow local customs in terms of clothing, but do not imitate the so-called "bohemian" style (long hair, large bow ties), which will make people laugh. It is best to pay attention to others and follow the majority. In ordinary times, it is better to dress a little more neatly than to be too casual. Cleanliness is also essential. Americans are tolerant of their own people in everything, but they are sometimes picky about foreigners, saying that others do not know etiquette. Chinese-owned laundries are almost everywhere in America. Although the prices are not necessarily cheaper, the work is always more authentic than that of general American laundry workers. Moreover, the money they earn through hard work is either sent back to the motherland or donated to disaster relief or to support the war effort. It can be said that it is an obligation for all those living in America to patronize their businesses. They are usually very friendly to Chinese students. Students who speak Cantonese may be invited to their shops for festivals, especially during Chinese New Year, to enjoy a lavish feast. Female students mostly do their own laundry, and most of the rental houses in women's dormitories have laundry facilities. When in America, do not casually leave your clothes and hats, especially expensive items such as leather coats. Especially in large cities, some people are not shy about taking good things.

<h3>Shanghai Shipping Trends (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Scenery</p>
<p>Domestic Shipping Routes: There were originally shipping lines to the Yangtze River, South China, and North China. The Yangtze River line departed from the Huangpu River in Shanghai through the Wusongkou and went upstream along the Yangtze River, passing through Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiujiang, and reaching Hankou. From Hankou, it could go upstream to Changsha, Yichang, Chongqing, and other ports. The South China line departed from the Huangpu River in Shanghai through the Wusongkou and went south into the East China Sea and the South China Sea. Most of the ships terminated in Guangzhou, and very few sailed to Haiphong. The North China line departed from the Huangpu River in Shanghai through the Wusongkou and went north into the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea, reaching Tianjin. Along the way, it stopped at Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and other ports. Some ships also terminated at Andong, Dalian, Niuzhuang, and Qinhuangdao. After the war, the conditions of the shipping lines often changed due to the unstable situation. Except for Japanese ships that could still travel the Shanghai-Hankou line, foreign merchant ships could only navigate to ports such as Zhanghuanggong and Xingang at the mouth of the Yangtze River. The South China line is currently thriving in terms of passengers and cargo because Haiphong and Annam have become important channels into the interior of our country. Therefore, most companies' ships have changed their destination to Haiphong. Other seaports such as Shantou, Xiamen, and Guangzhou have fallen one after another. Therefore, the main ports of the South China shipping route are only Hong Kong and Haiphong. The ships of the North China shipping route continue to operate, as passenger and cargo traffic between Shanghai and Tianjin is still quite busy. The names of the shipping companies operating along the coast of our country and Annam, and the shipping routes they operate, are listed below:</p>
<p>1.  Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. (Indo-China S.N. Go.): A British company, operating small Yangtze River routes with ships such as Ruihe and Tonghe, with several trips per week, all arriving on the same day. For the Haiphong-Tianjin route, there are new ships Taisheng, Yongsheng, and Desheng, each with a load capacity of approximately 4,000 tons. The four new ships of the former state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Yuanheng Lizhen, were renamed Yisheng, Hesheng, Yusheng, and Mingsheng after being resold to the company. Each ship has a tonnage of approximately 3,400 tons. The cabins are divided into first class, second class, large dining room, officer's cabin, staterooms (only available on Yongsheng, Taisheng, Desheng, etc.), dormitory berths, and economy class. Since the addition of these four new ships to the route, the company's lineup has become increasingly strong. The above ships are scheduled to depart from Shanghai on four days of the week, passing through Hong Kong and arriving at Haiphong, then returning to Shanghai from Haiphong, and then sailing north through Weihaiwei and Yantai to Tianjin. This round trip takes more than thirty days. In addition to the above ships, there are ships such as Fusheng, Lisheng, Guisheng, Fusheng, and Chunsheng operating on the Shanghai-Qingdao and Shanghai-Hong Kong routes.</p>
<p>2.  China Navigation Company (Butterfield &amp; Swire): Also a British company, operating the Shanghai-Tianjin line with regular ships Shuntian, Shengjing, and Hunan. The Shuntian and Shengjing are the most well-known, with a tonnage of over 3,000 tons. The cabins are divided into first class, second class, large dining room (Shuntian does not have a second class dining room), staterooms (Hunan does not have staterooms), dormitory berths, and economy class. They depart from Shanghai for Tianjin every Tuesday and Saturday, passing through Qingdao, Weihaiwei, Yantai, and other ports. It only takes three days from Shanghai to Tianjin, and they return from Tianjin every Thursday. For the Shanghai-Haiphong route, there are Jinan, Taiyuan, Jiaying, Qiongzhou, and Guangdong, among which Jinan and Taiyuan are the most well-known, with a tonnage of approximately 3,000 tons. The cabins are divided into large dining room, officer's cabin, dormitory berths (staterooms are only available on Jiaying), and economy class. The scheduled trips are once a week, and it takes ten days to sail from Shanghai to Haiphong, stopping at Hong Kong (staying for approximately two days) and Guangzhou Bay along the way. In addition, ships such as Shandong, Sichuan, and Jiangsu often operate between Shanghai and Hong Kong, sometimes also calling at Haiphong. These ships have staterooms but no dormitory berths. Other ships such as Yunnan, Hubei, Yuezhou, Haikou, and Nanchang are dedicated to the Tianjin-Hong Kong route, stopping at Shanghai only occasionally. Recently, the company plans to open two lines: Shanghai-Siam and Shanghai-Singapore, using the Suzhou and Zhangjiakou to operate the Shanghai-Siam line, stopping at Hong Kong, Toulon, and Saigon along the way, and using the Qingyuan and Guiyang to operate the Shanghai-Singapore line to meet the needs of passengers and cargo.</p>
<h3>Canton-Hankou Railway Timetable</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>The Canton-Hankou Railway is currently operating between Zhuzhou and Lechang as the starting and ending stations. All ticket prices and other items for each station were published in detail in the 16th issue of this publication, which readers should already understand. It is now known that the railway has resumed service to Qujiang. At the same time, the 75th and 76th section trains between Zhuzhou and Hengyang, the 77th and 78th section trains between Hengyang and Lechang, and the 79th and 80th section mixed trains between Lechang and Qujiang have all been canceled. Therefore, the entire timetable has been changed. Here is the latest current timetable for the railway:</p>
<p>The following is the passenger train timetable. Except for trains 5 and 6, which have first, second, and third class sleeping cars and seating cars, the rest only have second and third class sleeping cars and passenger cars.</p>
<h3>Travel Q&amp;A</h3>
<p>Answer to Ms. Zhang Ming: 1. It is quite convenient to transfer to Jinhua via Ningbo. For Shanghai-Ningbo ship tickets, you can first request a guarantee from Lihe or Zhongyi Shipping Company. After a reputable shop provides a guarantee, along with three photos, you can purchase tickets from the respective company. The lowest ticket price is 3.50 national currency. From Ningbo to Jinhua, you can first take a small boat to Hengzhang, then take the highway to Jinhua. The travel cost is 11.70 yuan. It is best to bring as little luggage as possible. There is no particular inconvenience for a single woman, but it is best to have an identity certificate when traveling in the interior.</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Sun Zhongliang: 1. To go to Lishui, Zhejiang, you can take a small boat to Hengzhang after arriving in Ningbo, then take the highway via Xinchang, Shengxian, Dongyang, Yongkang, and reach Lishui. The travel cost is approximately 15 yuan.</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Gao Zhongwen: 1. To take a boat to Tianjin, you only need to have a smallpox vaccination certificate issued by the Municipal Council here to purchase tickets and depart. The lowest ticket price is 26 national currency. Most ships dock at Tanggu, and passengers must take a car to Tianjin from Tanggu. The inspection is very strict when landing at Tanggu, so it is best to bring as few books as possible.</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Li Funan: 1. Currently, only Butterfield &amp; Swire ships operate from Beihai to Shanghai, but there are very few trips. The journey takes at least eight days, with staterooms costing approximately 70 national currency and economy class costing 38 yuan.</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Jin Muye: 1. On the way from Shanghai to Chongqing, the China Travel Service has branches in Haiphong, Hanoi, Kunming, and Guiyang. There are hostels in Pingyi, Annam, Tongzi, and Qijiang. The total travel cost, including food and lodging, should be at least 210 yuan per person. 2. To take a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Hong Kong to Chongqing costs 400 Hong Kong dollars per person. If you take a plane from Hong Kong to Yunnan, there is no direct route. You should first take a French airline plane to Hanoi, which costs 14 pounds sterling per person. Then, take a China National Aviation Corporation or Eurasia plane from Hanoi to Yunnan, which costs 14 pounds sterling per person. Then, take a China National Aviation Corporation or Eurasia plane from Hanoi to Yunnan, which costs 140 Vietnamese currency per person. Each person is only allowed to bring 15 kilograms of luggage when flying. 3. Although taking the Zhejiang-Jiangxi route to the interior is still convenient, for safety reasons, taking the route through Vietnam is better. The travel cost from Guilin to Chongqing is 66.90 national currency, and to Kunming is 75.60 yuan. When traveling in the interior, you must have identification documents.</p>
<p>Answer to Mr. Guan Yilian: 1. To go to Taiping County, Anhui, it is also convenient to take the route through Ningbo. After arriving in Jinhua, take the train to Lanxi, then take the highway via Shexian to reach Taiping. The travel cost from Ningbo should be more than 30 yuan.</p>

<h3>The European Situation is Tense, Scenes on the Streets of Shanghai</h3>
<p>— (New Dream)</p>
<p>Newspaper Vendors are Very Active, Speculators are Uneasy</p>
<p>The atmosphere in Europe is extremely tense, resembling the eve of a great war, and Shanghai, far away in the eastern corner, has also broken its dull state and suddenly become tense due to the European situation. Everyone is waiting for news from Europe: peace or war?</p>
<p>The sound of "Extra Edition," which has not been heard for a long time, is spreading all over the streets and alleys. The newspaper vendors on Wangping Street are very active and showing off. Daily newspapers, evening newspapers, and extra editions are grabbed and run around, shouting at the top of their voices.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, the streets are full of people waiting for the newspapers to come out. Smart merchants and doctors use wall newspapers to promote their advertisements. The newspapers are posted up and surrounded by people who cannot afford to buy a copy to read. They are all closely watching the international news and the situation in Europe.</p>
<p>In the Changgeng Lane area of ​​Avenue Edward VII, every afternoon, many people wait for several foreign newspapers to post news summaries to see if Europe will go to war? What is Hitler doing? What is Chamberlain doing?</p>
<p>General speculators are uneasy about the European situation. Those with gold and foreign exchange are wondering whether to spit them out at this opportunity. Those who do not believe that the price of gold will fall immediately are hesitating whether to buy in. The speculative market, which changes rapidly and has several price movements a day, requires a keen eye. Fortunes are made at this time, and bankruptcies also occur at this time!</p>
<p>Once the "talking box" is opened, business people cannot escape their profession in three sentences: some argue that once the European war starts, foreign exchange will rise and foreign goods will fall in price; others say that if there is war in Europe, some foreign goods will disappear from the market and rise sharply, as there were many examples in the previous European war. Everyone has their reasons, and it is impossible to say who is right and who is wrong.</p>
<p>Those with a higher level of knowledge talk about international issues. The signing of the German-Soviet non-aggression pact was unexpected. How will it benefit China? How disappointed will Japan be? What will happen to the East if a war breaks out in Europe? Will there be changes in Shanghai and Hong Kong? Is a European war beneficial or harmful to China?</p>
<p>The people in the entire city are so concerned about the events in Europe that even women who never read newspapers are talking about their half-understood international news. Germany and Russia are making friends, which is miserable for "××××." If Europe goes to war, can Shanghai be stable? Don't the foreigners in the concessions start fighting as well, which would be terrible. If the news is bad, we can only go back to the interior.</p>
<p>In short, these few days, whether you stay at home or go outside, you can hear people talking about the events in Europe everywhere. Although it is across the ocean, it seems to be close at hand. This proves that in the modern world, a war in one corner will affect every corner, and the relationships between countries are closely related.</p>
<h3>Salary Increases in Shanghai Foreign Firms</h3>
<p>— Foreign Employee</p>
<p>In the past six months, the lives of Shanghai citizens have been very difficult due to rising prices. Of course, employees of foreign firms are no exception. An average salary of thirty to fifty yuan a month is difficult to exchange for food alone. Therefore, no matter how frugal you are, changing from long clothes to short clothes, from rice to porridge, or always eating rice flour, it is still impossible to make a living in today's soaring prices. Therefore, it is the urgent request of every foreign firm employee to hope that the company will generally increase salaries (allowances). The salary increase situation of various foreign firms has become news that everyone needs to know.</p>
<p>I have been working in foreign firms for more than twenty years, and I have worked in more than a dozen foreign firms. Because I know many employees of foreign firms, I am more familiar with the salary increase situation of various foreign firms. In order to meet everyone's need to know about the salary increase situation of various foreign firms, it is not meaningless for me to write down what I know and tell everyone.</p>
<p>The following are the salary increase situations of several famous foreign firms:</p>
<p>British American Tobacco Company: 20% to 30%, Wong Lo Kat: 30%, Imperial Chemical Industries: 20% to 40%, Wheelock and Marden: 20%, Ewo Firecracker Company: 20%, Sassoon: 20% to 30%, Siemens: 20%, Jardine Engineering Corporation: 20%, Shanghai Telephone Company: 40%, General Electric Company: 30%, Standard Oil: +%, Texaco: 15%, Shanghai Power Company: 20%.</p>
<p>Among these foreign firms, some increased salaries automatically, and some did so after requests. However, whether it was automatic or passive, the fact that the authorities of these companies were able to understand the suffering of the employees is worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>However, there are still many foreign firms that have a disregard for the lives of their employees, such as the famous ×× foreign firm. It is said that when the manager of the firm was at a meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council discussing the salary increase issue for the employees of the Municipal Council, he was the only one who voted against it. When the firm's employees initially requested a salary increase from the authorities, the authorities replied: "×× is a British firm, and it follows the Shanghai Municipal Council's regulations, so it only increased one or two yuan." Later, when the Shanghai Municipal Council increased by 20%, the employees asked for the same increase, and the authorities said: "The Shanghai Municipal Council is the Shanghai Municipal Council, and ×× is ××," refusing to follow the Shanghai Municipal Council's regulations.</p>
<p>I remember that in the Shanghai Municipal Council's annual report from some year, when talking about the salaries of the police officers, the report stated that the Russian police officers' salary was 90 yuan per month, and the Chinese police officers' salary was 40 yuan per month. The annual report explained that the reason why the Chinese police officers' salary was lower was because the cost of food for the Chinese, who ate rice, was lower than that of the Russians, who ate meat. Now that the price of rice has reached 40 yuan, the Chinese who eat rice are getting the same salary as before, and they cannot even afford to eat rice. The employees of Shanghai foreign firms feel this very acutely.</p>
<h3>After the Rain, the Sky Clears</h3>
<p>— Bao Tianxiao</p>
<p>Chapter 15: Overseas Scandal Suddenly Welcomes Peach Leaf, Extraordinary Scene in the Fire Reveals Lotus Flower</p>
<p>That day, there was a concert in the Jiaang area. Alice's mother, who was also a musician, had made arrangements in advance and went to the concert that night. Alice was originally going to go as well, but suddenly she had a headache that afternoon. Headaches were originally minor matters, but there were many acquaintances at the concert, especially Ms. O'Hishi, who was most beautiful. Headaches often made people feel unwell, so Mrs. Alice said: "It's okay not to go. Just rest at home!" This concert was a grand affair, and many people from Lyon University went as well. Cheng Gong did not specialize in music, but he also went because he thought Alice and her mother would definitely be there. However, he only saw Mrs. Alice and not Alice, which was very disappointing to him. The concert ended after midnight at half past one. He did not expect that news would come in that the Albert Apartments had caught fire. It was Albert's apartment. In fact, it was a little earlier when the two children in the second floor of the apartment had already caused the disaster. It was not until 11:15 that someone noticed, and the fire brigade arrived there twenty minutes later. Everyone on the street knew that the Albert Building was on fire. However, the concert was still playing a famous piece by a piano master and a violin expert who had been invited from Paris. Everyone was listening attentively, and the concert hall was well-built, so no outside noise could enter. When the piece ended, the person in charge of the concert reported: "The Albert Building is on fire. Ladies and gentlemen, are there any of you who live near there?" As soon as these words were said, Mrs. Alice was the first to rush out. Cheng Gong followed closely behind. The others who were related to the Albert Building, students from Lyon University, and those who were acquainted with Alice also ran out one after another. When they arrived on the street, it was already a hubbub of voices, and they could see a red glow in the sky. At this time, Europe's firefighting methods were not as advanced as they would later become. Mrs. Alice arrived at the apartment next to the Albert Road, where she lived, but she did not see her beloved daughter Alice. She thought: "Alice must be at home tonight and did not go out. She lives on the fifth floor, and the fire started on the third floor. The fire rises, and if the stairs are burned, how can the people on the fifth floor get down? Moreover, she said she had a headache, so maybe she is already fast asleep." Mrs. Alice jumped up and down and screamed, "Alice! My Alice! Who will save her!" She saw a person jump out of the crowd and say, "Mrs. Alice, I will go look for Alice!" He jumped into the fire from the fire truck's ladder. (174)</p>
<h3>No Way Out</h3>
<p>— Bai Hua</p>
<p>"Flirting With Fates"</p>
<p>A Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Production, Showing at the Nanjing Grand Theater</p>
<p>The big-mouthed Joe E. Brown also has a long history with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, but his works are all so-called "unspeakably wonderful" slapstick films. Compared to other Hollywood comedians, he is not as humorous as Laurel and Hardy (Laurel and Hardy also have some terribly chaotic works), but he is not as annoying as the Marx Brothers and the Ritz Brothers. Every one of his works is very lively, and the writers do not care whether the story is reasonable or unreasonable in order to create excitement.</p>
<p>Recently, after the release of Laurel and Hardy's "Block-Heads" and the Ritz Brothers' "The Three Musketeers," the general opinion is that the method of abandoning the play to accommodate the actors is quite successful. Joe E. Brown's "No Way Out" is at least influenced by this.</p>
<p>The story is as follows: Joe E. Brown is the owner of a traveling theater troupe. He leads the troupe members to perform in South America. He is in conflict with the local theater owner and becomes impoverished in a foreign land. Because he has life insurance, he attempts to commit suicide to use the compensation to help the troupe members. Thus, he makes all kinds of jokes in various suicide methods and finally obtains a one-year performance contract with the theater owner's permission.</p>
<p>This story is naturally absurd, and the slapstick is also excessively exaggerated, but the director is at least influenced by the above-mentioned factors by being able to take advantage of the rich local color and the atmosphere of the music.</p>
<p>And Joe E. Brown's two episodes of pretending to commit suicide and acting as a cow are also lovely. His attitude when drinking and the cow's actions are much more brilliant than those of general directors who specialize in learning a little bit of superficial knowledge.</p>
<p>If the script could strengthen the various embarrassing situations of the troupe members when they were down on their luck, and give Steffi Duna and Livo Carlilo more opportunities to act due to the party members' dissatisfaction with Sanco's greed for women, it might have achieved even better results.</p>
<p>The zinc plate above is a recent work by Mr. Tang Menggu.</p>
